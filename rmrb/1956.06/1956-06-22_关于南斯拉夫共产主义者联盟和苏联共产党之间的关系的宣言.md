During the official visit of the government delegation of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia to the Soviet Union from June 1st to 23rd, 1956, Josip Broz Tito General Secretary of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, Kardelj Secretary of the Executive Committee of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, Blažević, Mijuović, Popović and Todorović, members of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, as representatives of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the Socialist Alliance of Working People of Yugoslavia, together with Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, Voroshilov, Mikoyan, Molotov, members of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and Shepilov, alternate member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, as representatives of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, exchanged views on the relationship and cooperation between the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in a spirit of comradely sincerity and frankness.
    They reached agreement on the following points in the talks:
    I.	The Belgrade Declaration of June 2, 1955, laid a healthy foundation for relations between the two socialist countries, and the principles declared in the Declaration have been applied more and more widely in their mutual cooperation.
    II.	The overall development of cooperation and relations between the two countries since the signing of the Belgrade Declaration, as well as the contacts between the political and other social organizations of the two peoples, have also created favorable political conditions for cooperation between the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.
    Based on the above situation, and taking into account the specific conditions of the development of the modern socialist movement, and in the spirit of the internationalist principles of Marxism-Leninism, the delegation of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the delegation of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union unanimously believe that: it is beneficial and necessary to continue and develop the current contacts between the two parties. The purpose of doing so is to cooperate in order to further strengthen and prosper our socialist countries, to cooperate in the international workers' movement on many current issues of socialist development, and also to develop peaceful coexistence and cooperation between the people of all countries in the world with different social and political systems, for peace, freedom and independence of all peoples.
    At the same time, the representatives of the two parties believe that the further development of relations and cooperation between the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia will undoubtedly help to further develop cooperation between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia and help to consolidate the permanent friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia are the leading parties in the countries ruled by the working class, and the common goal of the two parties is to build a complete socialist society in their own countries and to ensure human progress and lasting peace.
    III.	Both sides believe that the road to socialism is different in different countries and under different conditions, and that the diverse forms of socialist development help to strengthen socialism, and believe that neither side should have any tendency to force the other side to accept its views on the road and form of socialist development. In this view, both sides agree that the above-mentioned cooperation should be based on complete voluntariness and equality, friendly criticism, and comradely exchange of views on the disputed issues between the two parties.
    IV.	Based on the above principles, the cooperation between the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union will first of all be carried out by fully introducing each other's methods and methods of building socialism, and by freely and fraternally exchanging views on issues of common concern in the development of socialist practice and socialist ideology, as well as on issues related to peace, the rapprochement and mutual exchanges between peoples, and the progress of all mankind.
    V.	The current changes in the world in terms of material and spirit are manifested in the vigorous growth of socialist forces, the upsurge of national liberation movements, and the increasing role of the working class in solving the specific problems of the development of the current international situation; these changes have raised many major issues to the international workers' movement. This fact shows that it is also necessary to conduct a scientific analysis of various phenomena, major material and social factors, and the current development trends in the world. For these reasons, they agreed that, based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism, they will do their best to encourage mutual cooperation in their mutual relations and in the entire international workers' movement, and to encourage the exchange of views in socialist scientific thought.
    VI.	In terms of the specific forms of cooperation between the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the delegations of both sides agreed that cooperation will be carried out through the following methods: direct contact, written and oral statements and exchange of views, mutual visits of delegations, exchange of materials and books, and holding meetings of party leaders as needed to discuss pressing issues of mutual concern, in short, to use all constructive forms of comradely discussion to achieve cooperation.
    VII.	The representatives of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia believe that this cooperation is an integral part of their contacts with communist and workers' parties in other countries, as well as with the world socialist movement and other progressive movements.
    VIII.	The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia believe that, in order to strive for lasting peace and the security of all peoples, and in order to strive for social progress, all progressive and peace-loving forces must carry out extensive cooperation, which is increasingly strongly expressed in various forms throughout the world. Such cooperation is one of the necessary conditions for the development of modern society. This relationship should be equal, open and honest, democratic and acceptable to world public opinion. This relationship should promote mutual understanding and consultation on issues of common concern, and should help to understand each other's positions and views on the basis of patient explanation. At the same time, it goes without saying that each participant in this cooperation can act freely in accordance with its own conditions of development, in line with the common progressive goals pursued by the participants in the cooperation.
    The representatives of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union believe that cooperation between the labor movements of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union on the basis of the above principles and forms will benefit the people of both sides and the socialist construction of the two countries. They believe that in this way, they will contribute to the universal rapprochement between the socialist movement and other progressive movements around the world, which is also conducive to world peace and the common progress of all mankind.

    关于南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟和苏联共产党之间的关系的宣言
    在南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国政府代表团1956年6月1日到23日正式访问苏联期间，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟总书记铁托，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟中央委员会执行委员会书记卡德尔，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟中央委员会委员布拉热维奇、米丘诺维奇、波波维奇和托多罗维奇，作为南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟和南斯拉夫劳动人民社会主义联盟的代表，同苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫，苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员布尔加宁、伏罗希洛夫、米高扬、莫洛托夫和苏联共产党中央委员会主席团候补委员谢皮洛夫，作为苏联共产党的代表，本着同志的真诚和坦率的精神，就南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟和苏联共产党之间的关系和合作问题交换了意见。
    他们在会谈中就下列各点达成了一致的意见：
    一、1955年6月2日的贝尔格莱德宣言为两个社会主义国家之间的关系奠定了健康的基础，宣言中宣布的原则在它们的互相合作中得到了越来越广泛的运用。
    二、贝尔格莱德宣言签署后两国之间的合作和关系的总的发展，以及两国人民的政治和其他社会团体之间的接触，也替苏联共产党和南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟之间的合作创造了有利的政治条件。
    根据上述情况，并且考虑到现代社会主义运动发展的具体条件，本着马克思列宁主义的国际主义原则，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟代表团和苏联共产党代表团一致认为：继续进行和发展两党目前的接触是有益的和必要的，这样做的目的在于：为了进一步加强和繁荣我们的社会主义国家而实行合作，为了在国际工人运动中就许多当前社会主义发展的问题实行合作，也是为了发展社会和政治制度不同的世界各国人民之间的和平共处和合作，为了和平、各国人民的自由和独立。
    同时，两党代表认为，苏联共产党和南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟之间的关系和合作的进一步发展，无疑地将有助于进一步发展苏南两国之间的合作，有助于巩固南苏两国人民的永久友谊，苏联共产党和南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟是工人阶级执政的国家中的领导政党，并且两党的共同目标都是在自己的国家建成完全的社会主义社会以及保障人类进步和持久和平。
    三、双方相信：在不同的国度和不同的条件下，社会主义的发展道路是不同的，社会主义发展的多样形式有助于社会主义的加强，并且认为任何一方都不得有强迫对方接受它的关于社会主义发展道路和形式的见解的任何倾向。双方本着这种看法同意，上述的合作应当以完全自愿和平等、友好批评以及就两党的争执问题进行同志式的交换意见为基础。
    四、基于上述原则，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟和苏联共产党之间的合作首先将通过这样的方式进行：相互全面地介绍两国建设社会主义的方式和方法，就对社会主义实践的发展和社会主义思想的发展方面共同关心的问题，以及就有关和平、各国人民之间的接近及相互来往和全人类进步的问题，进行自由的和同志式的交换意见。
    五、现在世界在物质上和精神上的变化表现在社会主义力量的蓬勃增长上，表现在民族解放运动的高涨上，表现在工人阶级在解决当前国际形势发展的具体问题方面的作用的增长上；这种变化向国际工人运动提出了许多重大问题。这个事实说明，也有必要对种种现象、主要的物质的和社会的因素以及现在世界的发展趋势进行科学的分析。由于这些原因，他们同意：将本着马克思列宁主义的原则，尽力鼓励在他们的相互关系上和整个国际工人运动中相互合作，鼓励在社会主义科学思想方面交换意见。
    六、在南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟和苏联共产党之间具体的合作形式方面，双方代表团同意，将通过下列办法进行合作：直接接触、书面和口头的陈述和交换意见、代表团相互访问、交换材料和书籍，以及根据需要举行党的领导者的聚会，讨论双方关心的迫切问题，总之要利用一切建设性的同志讨论的形式来实现合作。
    七、苏联共产党和南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟代表认为，这种合作是他们同其他国家共产党和工人党以及同世界社会主义运动和其他进步运动接触的组成部分。
    八、苏联共产党和南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟认为，为了争取持久和平和各国人民的安全，为了争取社会进步，一切进步力量和爱好和平的力量必须进行广泛的合作，这一点在全世界范围内越来越强烈地通过各种各样的形式表现出来。这种合作是现代社会发展的必要条件之一。这种关系应该是平等的、开诚布公的、民主的和为世界舆论所能够接受的。这种关系应当促进互相了解和就共同关心的种种问题进行协商，应该有助于在耐心解释的基础上互相了解各方面的立场和观点。同时，不用说，这种合作的每一个参加者可以根据自己的发展条件，在符合合作的参加者所追求的共同的进步目标的情况下自由行动。
    南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟和苏联共产党的代表相信，南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国和苏联的工人运动在上述原则和形式的基础上进行合作，会有利于双方的人民和有利于两国的社会主义建设。他们相信，这样，他们就对全世界的社会主义运动和其他进步运动之间的普遍的接近有所贡献，而这同样也有利于世界和平，有利于全人类的共同进步。
