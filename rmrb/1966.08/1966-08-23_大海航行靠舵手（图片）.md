	The great helmsman, Chairman Mao, we resolutely follow your commands. Your words, we listen to and apply every sentence. Mao Zedong Thought illuminates our hearts, and the revolutionary flame burns brightly. The old world, we will smash it to pieces, and the new revolutionary world, we will definitely build.

	Chairman Mao warmly smiles at us, watching the revolutionary army march forward in an unstoppable tide. He guides us in the direction of progress; he is the brightest sun in the hearts of the people. Following the great helmsman closely, with one heart and one mind, we ride the winds and break the waves. We will seize one victory after another, letting the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly everywhere!

		Our reporter

	Great teacher, Chairman Mao, we love you dearly. Your words are our battle commands; your books are the truth of revolution. We will grow in the midst of storms and waves, generation after generation holding high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought.
