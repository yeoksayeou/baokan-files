Wherever the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought is studied and applied, tremendous spiritual and material forces are generated. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the workers of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company have been studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, rapidly raising their class consciousness and revolutionary spirit, and driving the new wave of production forward. The entire enterprise is filled with a revolutionary atmosphere.

In the first seven months of this year, the company's main products—steel, steel products, pig iron, and coke—all exceeded the state plan; product quality has significantly improved; raw material consumption has been greatly reduced; labor productivity has increased substantially compared to last year; and 127 new types of steel products have been successfully trial-produced to meet various needs. The quantity and speed of these achievements are unprecedented in this enterprise.

The great victories achieved by the workers of Chongqing Steel in the first seven months of this year are victories of Mao Zedong Thought and of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Since the beginning of this year, the workers of Chongqing Steel have seen a new high tide in their mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. The workers have taken Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle for all their work and as the action guide for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have used Mao Zedong Thought, the most powerful and sharpest ideological weapon, to launch a fierce attack on all the ghosts and monsters that oppose the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought, and to smash all the old rules and regulations that hinder production development and restrict the revolutionary enthusiasm of the workers, paving the way for a new leap in production. In July, during the hottest season in the famous "Furnace City" of Chongqing, steel production, which is almost entirely high-temperature work, encountered difficulties. However, the workers of Chongqing Steel, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, had high revolutionary spirits and enthusiastic production initiative. They sweated profusely, battled the high temperatures, and put forward the resounding slogan of "fighting for victory in both the movement and production." They worked hard and achieved excellent production results. The famous advanced collective, the large rolling mill steel plate section, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "On the Chongqing Negotiations," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong." They drew strength from overcoming difficulties. They said: The temperature is high, the difficulties are great, but with Mao Zedong Thought, we fear nothing. In the high-temperature operations of over a hundred degrees, they insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works before class, applying Chairman Mao's works during class, and evaluating the study and application of Chairman Mao's works after class. In July, they created a product qualification rate of 99.82%, the highest so far this year, and successfully trial-produced several new products urgently needed by the state.

The revolutionary workers of Chongqing Steel have enthusiastically responded to the battle call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, breaking the monopoly of bourgeois technical "authorities" and "experts" on production technology in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; smashing all the foreign frameworks that bind production; sweeping away all the old rules and regulations that hinder the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers; establishing scientific management systems and operating procedures; greatly boosting the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat; greatly suppressing the arrogance of the bourgeoisie; and promoting the development of productive forces.

    在无产阶级文化大革命中活学活用毛主席著作
    重钢职工革命斗志昂扬推动生产跃进
    今年头七个月主要产品都超额完成国家计划，质量显著提高；试制成功一百二十七种钢材新产品，数量之多、时间之快，是这个企业前所未有的
    据新华社重庆三十日电　哪里活学活用伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，哪里就会产生巨大的精神力量和物质力量。重庆钢铁公司广大职工在无产阶级文化大革命中，活学活用毛主席著作，阶级觉悟迅速提高，革命斗志极为昂扬，推动着生产新高潮迅猛发展，整个企业到处是一片热气腾腾的革命景象。
    今年头七个月，这个公司的主要产品钢、钢材、生铁、焦炭等都超额完成国家计划；产品质量显著提高；原材料消耗大幅度降低；劳动生产率比去年有大幅度增长；七个月试制成功了一百二十七种适应各方面需要的钢材新产品，数量之多，时间之快，为这家企业前所未有。
    重钢职工今年头七个月所取得的巨大胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利，也是无产阶级文化大革命的胜利。今年以来，重钢职工活学活用毛主席著作的群众性活动出现了新高潮。广大职工以毛泽东思想作为一切工作的指导方针，作为无产阶级文化大革命的行动指南，他们运用毛泽东思想这个最强大、最锐利的思想武器，向一切反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的牛鬼蛇神猛烈开火，向一切阻碍生产发展和束缚工人革命积极性的陈规旧套冲击，为新的生产跃进铺平了道路。今年七月，正是著名“火炉城”重庆最热的季节，几乎全是高温作业的钢铁生产遇到了困难。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的重钢工人们，革命精神昂扬，生产积极性极为高涨，他们洒热汗，战高温，提出了“誓夺运动、生产双胜利”的响亮口号，艰苦奋战，夺得了出色的生产成绩。公司著名先进集体大型轧钢车间钢板工段的轧钢工人们，反复学习了毛主席的《关于重庆谈判》、《为人民服务》和《愚公移山》等文章，从中汲取战胜困难的力量。他们说：气温高，困难大，有了毛泽东思想，什么也不怕。在上百度的高温操作中，他们坚持班前学习毛主席著作，班中运用毛主席著作，班后评比活学活用毛主席著作。在七月份创造了产品合格率高达百分之九十九点八二的今年以来的最高纪录，还试制成功了多种国家急需的新产品。
    重钢革命职工坚决地热烈地响应党中央、毛主席的战斗号召，在无产阶级文化大革命中大破资产阶级技术“权威”、
  “专家”对生产技术的垄断地位；大破束缚生产的种种洋框框，横扫阻碍工人积极性和创造性的陈规旧套，建立了科学的管理制度和操作规程，大长无产阶级的革命志气，大灭资产阶级的威风，促进了生产力的发展。
