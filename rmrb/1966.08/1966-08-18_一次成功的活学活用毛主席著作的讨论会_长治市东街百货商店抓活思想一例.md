Learning Chairman Mao's works must focus on the "use" aspect, emphasizing "learning with problems in mind, applying actively, integrating learning with use, learning what is urgently needed, and seeing immediate results." The discussion held at Dongjie Department Store in Changzhi City is a vivid example of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works to address real-life issues. — Editor

A few days ago, a middle-aged man came to Dongjie Department Store in Changzhi City. He held up a yuan and said, "Yesterday afternoon, I bought eight chi of cloth here. The cashier gave me the change, and I didn't count it. Later, I found out that I was given an extra yuan. I hurried back to return the money, but the store had already closed. It's all my fault for being careless and causing you trouble." He handed over the yuan and turned to leave. The store manager chased after him and asked which unit he was from and his name. He replied, "We're all family, no need to ask." He got on his bicycle and left.

This incident deeply moved the store's employees. The store's leadership saw this as a living example to educate the staff and organized a discussion titled "What Can We Learn from This Customer?" to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works.

Below are some of the employees' speeches:

**A Penny More, a Penny Less**

Zhou Qiu'e: We gave the customer an extra yuan, and this customer, seeing our difficulties as his own, quickly returned the money. How do I treat customers compared to how this customer treats us?

I'll share an incident:

One day, a customer came to buy shoelaces. Each pair of shoelaces was originally priced at seven jiao five fen, but to save time, I rounded it up to eight fen when telling the customer the price. I didn't expect the customer to want to buy two pairs. At that moment, I thought: since I said eight fen per pair, how could I change it back to seven jiao five fen? So, I charged one jiao six fen, unjustly taking an extra fen from the customer.

A fen is a small amount, but how we handle it is significant. Comparing myself to this customer's noble character, I realized I haven't truly established the idea of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people. I lack the spirit of being extremely responsible to the work and extremely enthusiastic towards the people. A fen might seem trivial, but it is the sweat of the working people. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Care more about the party and the people than about oneself, care more about others than about oneself." Taking an extra fen from the customer means not caring about the people's interests and adding a bit of falseness to serving the people.

Chairman Mao said: "Any action of a revolutionary party is the implementation of a policy. It is either the implementation of a correct policy or an incorrect policy; ... People's practice, especially that of a revolutionary party and revolutionary masses, is never disconnected from this or that policy."

Our work might seem mundane, but it is the concrete implementation of the party's policies. Taking an extra fen from the customer is a violation of the party's policies.

**Sticking to Rules, Forgetting the People**

Li Huandi: On March 23rd, an elderly man wanted to buy two pieces of chalk to write slogans. I strictly followed the old rule of not selling in small quantities. The elderly man had no choice but to buy a box. As he paid, he muttered, "Farmers don't buy idle goods, this box of chalk will last a year!" At that time, I didn't take his words seriously and even thought he was too stingy.

This customer's communist spirit moved me. I conducted a self-examination and deeply felt that I lacked a people's perspective and hadn't truly established the idea of wholeheartedly serving the people. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our responsibility is to the people. Every word, every action, every policy must serve the people's interests." What I did completely went against Chairman Mao's teachings: it wasn't about being responsible to the people but to the rules; it wasn't about serving the people's interests but my own convenience. Why did I stick to the old rules and not consider the people? Through studying Chairman Mao's works, I realized that I hadn't established a deep class feeling with the working people, so I couldn't consider the customers' needs. This was a mistake against the people, violating Chairman Mao's instructions.

With the determination to correct my mistake, I visited the elderly man, apologized for my error, took back the extra chalk I sold, and returned the money. The elderly man was very moved and patted my shoulder, saying, "You are a good girl." Only then did I truly feel the customers' warmth towards us. I said, "Grandpa, I did this because I listened to Chairman Mao's words." The elderly man gave back the one jiao eight fen I returned to him, saying, "Use this money to buy more advertisement colors. I want to make the slogan boards even better so that everyone on the street can study Chairman Mao's works."

The elderly man's words made me realize even more deeply that only by seriously listening to Chairman Mao's words can we truly do our work well and better serve the people.

**Letting Go of "Me" to Think of the People**

Yang Donghua: For a long time, our group would, a few days before inventory, not restock sold-out items or unpack new stock. The reason was to make inventory easier: fewer items and quantities meant less work during inventory. Last October, three days before inventory, three boxes of glass were delivered from the wholesale department. We followed the old method and placed them under the counter. Many customers came to buy glass, but we turned them away with the words "out of stock."

This customer's noble deed gave us a vivid political lesson, inspiring me greatly. These days, whenever I recall those customers leaving the store with disappointed expressions, I feel heavy-hearted. I have let down the party and the people's trust in me. Chairman Mao teaches us to "wholeheartedly serve the people, never leaving them; everything should be for the people's interests, not for personal or small group interests." In the past, I didn't follow Chairman Mao's instructions, mainly because I often thought of "me." When facing issues, I didn't think of the people first but of myself. Letting go of "me" means thinking of the people. Thinking more of "me" means thinking less of the people, leading to indifference towards the people's actual problems. In the future, I will treat the customers' difficulties as my own, urgently helping them and sharing their joys; I will be a socialist commerce warrior who wholeheartedly serves the people.

### 一次成功的活学活用毛主席著作的讨论会　长治市东街百货商店抓活思想一例

　　一次成功的活学活用毛主席著作的讨论会
　　长治市东街百货商店抓活思想一例
    学习毛主席著作，一定要在“用”字上狠下功夫，要“带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影”。长治市东街百货商店的这次讨论会，就是活学活用毛主席著作，抓好活思想的一个生动的事例。　——编者
    前些日子，有位中年人来到长治市东街百货商店，拿着一块钱说：“昨天下午我在咱店买了八尺布，营业员同志找给的零钱我也没看，晚上才发现多找了一块钱，赶回来退给商店，你们已经下班了。都怨我当时粗心，给你们添了许多麻烦。”说完话，把这一块钱递过来，转身就走。商店主任追到门外，问他是哪个单位的，叫什么名字？他说：“自家人，不必问。”骑上自行车就走了。
    这件事情使商店职工很受感动。商店领导认为这件事是教育职工的活教材，就以“向这位顾客学习什么”为题，组织职工活学活用毛主席著作，进行了一场热烈的讨论。
    下面，是几个职工的发言。
　　多收一分钱　掺了一分假
    周秋娥：我们多找给顾客一块钱，这位顾客怕我们结不了账，把我们的困难看成是他自己的困难，很快把钱送回来。顾客如此对待我们，可是我是怎样对待顾客的呢？
    我谈这样一件事情：
    一天，一位顾客来买鞋带。本来每副鞋带是七分五厘钱，但是，我在介绍价格时图省事，就按“四舍五入”的规矩，告诉顾客是八分钱一副。没有想到这位顾客要买两副。当时我想：既然说了八分一副，怎好再说七分五厘呢？于是，就按一角六分收了款，无缘无故多收了顾客一分钱。
    一分钱是小事，怎么对待它却是大事。用这位顾客的高大形象对照，使我认识到自己还没有真正树立起“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的思想，缺乏对工作极端负责任和对人民极端热忱的精神。一分钱，看来是微不足道的，但也是劳动人民的血汗。毛主席教导我们：“关心党和群众比关心个人为重，关心他人比关心自己为重。”多收了顾客一分钱，就是对群众的利益不关心，就是在为人民服务方面掺了一分假。
    毛主席说：“一个革命政党的任何行动都是实行政策。不是实行正确的政策，就是实行错误的政策；……人们的实践，特别是革命政党和革命群众的实践，没有不同这种或那种政策相联系的。”
    我们的工作看来是平凡的劳动，但都是具体地执行党的政策；多收了顾客一分钱，就是破坏了党的政策。
　　死抠制度　忘了群众
    李焕弟：三月二十三日，一位老大爷要买两支粉笔，写语录牌。我死抠着旧规定不零卖。老大爷没有办法，只好买了一盒。他一边付钱，一边叨念：“庄稼人不买半年闲，这盒粉笔一年也用不完哪！”当时，我听了这些话，很不以为然，反而觉得老汉太小气。
    这位顾客退回一块钱的共产主义精神，打动了我的心，我认真进行检查，深深感到自己缺乏群众观点，还没有真正树立起全心全意为人民服务的思想。毛主席教导我们：“我们的责任，是向人民负责。每句话，每个行动，每项政策，都要适合人民的利益。”我做的这件事完全违背了毛主席的教导：不是向人民负责，而是向制度负责；不是适合人民的利益，而是适合了只图自己省事的个人利益。我为什么死抠旧规定，不为群众着想呢？通过学习毛主席著作，认识到是自己思想上还没有和劳动人民建立起深厚的阶级感情，因而就不能遇事为顾客着想。这是违背了毛主席的指示，对人民犯了一次错误。
    本着决心改正错误的精神，我访问了这位老大爷，检讨了错误，收回多卖出去的粉笔，退还了钱。老大爷很激动，摸着我的肩膀说：“你真是个好姑娘。”这时我才真正体会到顾客对我们多么亲热啊！我说：“大爷，我是听了毛主席的话才这样做的。”老大爷把退给他的一角八分钱又交给我，说：“用这钱买成广告颜色，我要把语录牌办得更好，让街道上的人都能学习毛主席著作。”
    老大爷的话，使我更加深刻地认识到，只有认真地听毛主席的话，才能真正做好工作，更好地为人民服务。
　　丢不开“我”就想不到群众
    杨冬花：长时期以来，我们小组总是在盘货的前几天，有些商品卖完了也不进货，或者进了货也不拆开卖。原因是只图自己方便：商品的品种、数量越少，盘点时越省事。去年十月份，在盘货的前三天，从批发部进来三箱玻璃，我们照老办法放在柜台底下。许多顾客来买玻璃，都被我们用“没有”二字打发走了。
    这位送钱顾客的高尚行为，给我们上了一堂生动的政治课，使我受到极大的启示。这几天，每当我回忆起那些带着失望表情离开商店的顾客时，心里总是感到很沉重。我辜负了党和人民对自己的信任。毛主席教导我们，要“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众；一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发。”过去我没有按毛主席的指示办事，主要是思想上经常考虑一个“我”字。遇事不是先替群众着想，而是先为个人打算。丢不开“我”字，就想不到群众，为“我”想的多了，为群众想的一定少了，就会对群众生活的实际问题采取漠不关心的态度。今后，我要把顾客的困难看成是自己的困难，急顾客之急，乐顾客之乐；做一个全心全意为人民服务的社会主义商业战士。
