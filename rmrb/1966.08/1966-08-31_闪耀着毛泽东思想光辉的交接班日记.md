The editorial board recommends to everyone the diary of the passing of the baton written by workers from China's first platinum reforming petroleum chemical plant, which shines with Mao Zedong Thought.

The average age of the workers in this plant is only twenty-four years old. They continuously arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, with everyone voluntarily learning and persistently studying, taking Mao Zedong Thought as their guide for all actions. The first thing they do before starting work every day is to bring problems to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. In the shift, the first thing they do is to follow Chairman Mao's instructions, with a highly responsible attitude towards the people, meticulously ensuring production is done well. The first thing they do after finishing work is to use Mao Zedong Thought to examine their actions and summarize the day's work. They continuously use Mao Zedong Thought to transform themselves and deepen their ideological revolution. They continuously use Mao Zedong Thought to analyze production situations, grasp production laws, guide production practice, and ensure that China's first set of new-type petroleum chemical integrated equipment successfully started production. Now, this set of equipment has been running safely for more than 250 days, with all major indicators reaching or exceeding world advanced levels. They can achieve such outstanding results, as they themselves say: new recruits fighting tough battles, all thanks to the red ideology—Mao Zedong Thought. Now, all the workers are continuing to advance towards higher goals.

The diary of the passing of the baton by the workers in this plant is a collective notebook of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. It is a true record of using Mao Zedong Thought to observe, analyze, transform, and command everything. This is a powerful rebuttal to those bourgeois "authorities" who maliciously slander the workers, peasants, and soldiers studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

What is published here is a selection from the diary of the passing of the baton from this plant.

    闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的交接班日记
    编者按：我们向大家推荐我国第一座铂重整石油化工车间工人写的闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的交接班日记。
    这个车间职工平均年龄只有二十四岁。他们不断用毛泽东思想武装自己，人人自觉学，长期坚持学，把毛泽东思想作为自己一切行动的指南。他们每天上班前第一件事，就是带着问题活学活用毛主席著作。在班上，第一件事就是照毛主席的指示办事，用高度对人民负责的精神，一丝不苟地搞好生产。下班第一件事，就是用毛泽东思想检查自己的行动，总结每天的工作。他们不断用毛泽东思想改造自己，加深自己的思想革命化。他们不断用毛泽东思想分析生产形势，掌握生产规律，指导生产实践，使我国第一套新型的石油化工联合装置投产一次成功。现在这套装置已经安全运转了二百五十多天，各项主要指标都达到或超过了世界先进水平。他们能够创造出这样的优异成就，正如他们自己讲的那样：新兵打硬仗，全靠红思想——毛泽东思想。现在，全体职工正在继续向更高的目标前进。
    这个车间职工的交接班日记，是一部活学活用毛主席著作的集体笔记，是用毛泽东思想观察一切、分析一切、改造一切、统帅一切的真实记录。这是对那些恶毒诬蔑工农兵群众活学活用毛主席著作的资产阶级“权威”老爷们最有力的回击。
    这里发表的，是从这个车间交接班日记中摘抄的一部分。
