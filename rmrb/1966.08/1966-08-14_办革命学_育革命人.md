Our school combines work and study, truly integrating education with productive labor. This approach not only cultivates new talents needed by socialism but also produces new products welcomed by poor and lower-middle peasants.

Chairman Mao teaches us: Students should focus on learning, while also engaging in various activities, that is, not only studying literature but also learning industrial skills, agricultural skills, military skills, and criticizing bourgeois ideology. Every word of Chairman Mao's teachings expresses the ideals and aspirations of the children of poor and lower-middle peasants.

The Nanning "Five-Four" Work-Study School was established in 1958. We built our own workshops, factories, auditoriums, and dormitories. We also manufactured our own production equipment. While studying, we also engage in labor, ensuring that theory is closely integrated with practice. However, some individuals with bourgeois educational ideas have been constantly spreading cold winds, saying: "It is neither a school, nor a factory, nor an office, nor a cadre training class—it is a four-not-like." What the bourgeois authorities oppose, we support and endorse; what they say is bad, we say is good. We run our school according to Mao Zedong Thought and will not, and cannot, be like bourgeois schools.

Some people even say that students in such schools are "simple-minded, neither literate nor skilled." This is a slander against us. Through the practice of combining work and study, many of our classmates have discarded all the complex bourgeois ideas in their minds, such as pursuing fame and wealth, and avoiding hard work. We have more Mao Zedong Thought and more feelings for workers, peasants, and soldiers. We have cultivated a love for labor and a frugal lifestyle. We are not "simple-minded, neither literate nor skilled," but rather "intelligent, both literate and skilled."

Over the past eight years, students of our work-study school have not only learned to operate machine tools and produce precise machine parts but have also designed and manufactured more than thirty machines, innovating and improving many technical projects. When we deliver the threshers, pulpers, and water hammers we made to the poor and lower-middle peasants, they praise us, saying: "The students from the work-study school can read, work, and make machines. They are truly Chairman Mao's good students."

Over the past eight years, our school has sent batch after batch of conscious, cultured, and skilled new-type laborers to factories and rural areas. Those assigned to tractor stations have two-thirds evaluated as advanced producers and excellent tractor drivers; those assigned to farms are all evaluated as five-good team members; all twelve graduates who joined the army have been evaluated as five-good soldiers. They are truly capable of farming with a hoe, repairing machines with a wrench, defeating enemies with a rifle, and criticizing the bourgeoisie with a pen.

Chairman Mao's wise instructions give us boundless strength, wisdom, and courage. We will continue to walk the path of combining work and study, as we have in the past, and will do so more resolutely in the future.

　　办革命学　育革命人
    我们学校半工半读，使教育与生产劳动真正相结合，既培养了社会主义需要的新人材，又制造了贫下中农欢迎的新产品。
    广西南宁“五四”工读学校革命师生
    毛主席教导我们：学生以学为主，兼学别样，即不但学文，也要学工、学农、学军，也要批判资产阶级。毛主席句句话都表达了我们贫农下中农子女的理想和愿望。
    南宁“五四”工读学校是一九五八年创办的。我们自己动手建造了车间、厂房、礼堂、宿舍。自己动手制造生产设备。一面读书，一面劳动，使理论与实际紧密结合。可是，一些有资产阶级教育思想的人，却在不断地吹冷风，说：“既不象学校，也不象工厂，也不象机关，也不象干部训练班，是个四不象。”资产阶级权威反对的，正是我们要赞成的、拥护的；他们说糟得很，我们却说好得很。我们是按照毛泽东思想办学校，不会象也不能象资产阶级的学校。
    有的人甚至说这样学校的学生是“头脑简单，不文不武。”这是对我们的污蔑。我们许多同学在半工半读的实践中，抛掉了头脑里的追求名利、好逸恶劳等等所有复杂的资产阶级思想，我们有了更多的毛泽东思想，有了更多的工农兵的感情，养成了热爱劳动，艰苦朴素的作风。我们不是“头脑简单，不文不武”，而是“头脑聪明，亦文亦武”。
    八年来，我们工读学校的学生，不仅学会了使用机床，车出了精密的机器零件，还设计制造了三十多台机器，创造革新了不少技术项目。当我们把一台台亲手制造的脱粒机、打浆机、水锤泵送到贫下中农手里的时候，他们赞扬地说：“工读学校培养出来的学生会读书，会劳动，又会造机器，真是毛主席的好学生。”
    八年来，我们学校为工厂、农村输送了一批又一批有觉悟、有文化、有技术的新型劳动者。分配到拖拉机站的同学，有三分之二被评为先进生产者和优秀拖拉机手；分配到农场的同学，全部被评为五好场员；历届参军的十二人，全部被评为五好战士。他们真正是拿起锄头能种田，拿起扳手能装机器，拿起枪杆能消灭敌人，拿起笔杆能批判资产阶级。
    毛主席的英明指示，给予我们无穷的力量、智慧和勇气。半工半读的道路，我们过去走，现在走，将来还要更加坚定地走到底。
