Do Not Allow "Money Worship" to Corrupt Workers

Shanghai Eighth Iron and Steel Factory's model worker Qi Rongfan

Sun Yefang advocates using profit sharing and bonuses to stimulate enterprises to pursue profits and to "inspire" workers' enthusiasm. What is the difference between this and the bourgeoisie's advocacy of "money makes the mare go" and "money worship"? Sun Yefang wants to bring the bourgeoisie's "money worship" into socialist enterprises. This is an insult to our working class and the socialist system! This is an attempt to change the nature of our socialist enterprises and restore capitalism!

The revolutionary spirit of the workers in our socialist enterprises is always high. Is it for money? No.

This is because we have actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, armed our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and established the idea of doing everything for the revolution.

This is because we were oppressed and suffered greatly before liberation. Now we are the masters, and we have a high class consciousness.

This is because we want to compete with imperialism for time and speed, to catch up with the world's advanced level, and to change the poor and backward face of our motherland.

This is because we firmly oppose imperialism and revisionism, always thinking of the fact that two-thirds of the world's people are not yet liberated. We have the responsibility to raise the banner of internationalism and actively support the revolutionary struggles of the world's people.

This is because we have a great revolutionary ideal, to consolidate socialism, advance towards communism, and carry the proletarian revolution through to the end.

In a word, the driving force of our revolutionary spirit is Mao Zedong Thought, proletarian politics, and certainly not profits or bonuses. Sun Yefang's attempt to corrupt us with material incentives of profits and bonuses is in vain.

Our motivation for work is politics, not profits. The spirit inspired by this political leadership over business is enduring, solid, inexhaustible, and invincible. The comrades in our factory are always full of energy and enthusiasm in the three great revolutionary movements. A customer needed a batch of special specification coils. We did not have the necessary equipment to produce this type of coil, and it would be very difficult to produce. If it were like Sun Yefang, there would be no enthusiasm for this batch of orders without extra profits and bonuses. However, we understand the political significance of this batch of orders. Our enthusiasm is not only not diminished but is fully aroused. The steel rolling workers said, "The user urgently needs this batch of products, and we must produce it." The maintenance workers immediately organized a shock team, and in just two days, they made a homemade machine, finally completing this batch of orders.

I am an auxiliary worker. I know that auxiliary work is also revolutionary work. I love this work and insist on doing it with vigorous revolutionary spirit. For the convenience of night shift workers to pick up materials, I am willing to sleep in the warehouse. No matter how late it is, whoever needs materials, I will get up and give them to him. As long as it is beneficial to the revolution, I am willing to do it.

Sun Yefang, is our workers' enthusiasm really inspired by money?! This is clearly a slander against us workers, clearly an attempt to undermine socialism. We must thoroughly settle accounts with your crimes!

　　不许用“金钱主义”腐蚀工人
　　上海第八钢铁厂五好工人　戚荣繁
    孙冶方鼓吹用利润分成和奖金的办法来刺激企业追逐利润，来“鼓舞”职工干劲。这和资产阶级宣扬的“有钱能使鬼推磨”的“金钱主义”有什么区别呢？孙冶方想把资产阶级的“金钱主义”用到社会主义企业中来，这是对我们工人阶级和社会主义制度的侮辱！这是企图改变我们社会主义企业的性质，复辟资本主义！
    我们社会主义企业职工群众的革命干劲总是鼓得足足的，难道是为了钱么？不是。
    这是因为我们活学活用了毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装了头脑，树立了一切为革命的思想。
    这是因为我们在解放前做牛做马，受尽折磨，现在我们当家作主了，有了高度的阶级觉悟。
    这是因为我们要与帝国主义争时间，比速度，要赶超世界先进水平，立志改变祖国的一穷二白面貌。
    这是因为我们坚决反帝反修，时刻想到世界上还有三分之二的人民没有解放，我们有责任扛起国际主义大旗，积极支援世界人民的革命斗争。
    这是因为我们有远大的革命理想，要巩固社会主义，走向共产主义，把无产阶级革命进行到底。
    一句话，我们的革命干劲的动力，是毛泽东思想，是无产阶级政治，而决不是什么利润、奖金。孙冶方妄想用利润、奖金的物质刺激手段来腐蚀我们，这是枉费心机。
    我们工作的动力是政治而不是利润，这种政治统帅业务所产生的干劲，是持久的、巩固的，是取不尽、用不完的，是战无不胜、攻无不克的。我们厂里的同志，在三大革命运动中，始终生龙活虎，干劲十足。有一家用户需要一批特殊规格的盘条，我们没有生产这种盘条的必要设备，生产起来会有很大的困难。对于这批并无额外利润和额外奖金的订货任务，要是象孙冶方那样，就没有干劲了。可是，我们懂得这批订货的政治意义，我们的干劲不是鼓舞不起来，而是鼓得足足的。轧钢工人们说，用户迫切需要这批产品，我们一定要把它制出来。检修工人们立即组织突击队，只两天时间，就搞成了一台土机器，终于完成了这批订货任务。
    我是一个辅助工。我知道辅助工作同样是革命工作。我热爱这个工作，坚持以旺盛的革命干劲做好这个工作。为了夜班工人领料方便，我宁愿睡在仓库里。不论多么晚，谁要领料，我都起来拿给他。只要对革命有利，我就愿意做。
    孙冶方，难道我们工人的干劲，是靠钱鼓舞起来的吗？！这明明是你在污蔑我们工人，明明是你企图挖社会主义的墙脚。我们要彻底清算你的罪行！
