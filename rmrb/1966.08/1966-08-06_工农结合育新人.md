	Workers and peasants unite to train new people
	Practice has proven that the system of being both a worker and a peasant is a good one. This way, workers and peasants can learn from each other, deepen their feelings, and become all-around new-type laborers.
	Cheng Guangrong, worker at Sichuan Province Wenjiang District Nitrogen Fertilizer Factory

	This year, our factory paired up with the nearby Huaxian Commune Victory Brigade to implement a system where some workers rotate to the countryside to be peasants, and some peasants rotate to the factory to be workers.

	The first batch of workers who went to the countryside to be peasants arrived at the production team and participated in agricultural labor. They helped the peasants establish a technical night school, first studying Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts with the peasants, using class struggle as the key to grasp revolution and promote production. After we arrived in the countryside, we studied Chairman Mao's statements about class struggle in socialist society with the commune members. We often criticized bourgeois thoughts. The head of the tenth production team used the method of high work points to improve the quality of weeding. We discussed with the commune members the question of whether to farm for the revolution or for work points. The commune members criticized the head's method of leading with work points and material incentives, saying that was a capitalist method. Everyone proposed to learn from Norman Bethune and to farm for the revolution. After this discussion, politics took the lead, and weeding was done quickly and well.

	There are four of us from the factory who went to the tenth production team. Not long after we went to the countryside, two things happened: one was that one morning at three o'clock, it rained heavily, and the deputy head called everyone to get up and bundle the dried wheat straw. One of us wanted to sleep and did not participate in this labor; the other was that in the first few days of our labor, we were doing carrying work, and our shoulders were swollen, so everyone did not want to carry anymore but went to find light work to do. These two incidents reflected that there was still bourgeois thought in our minds. So we studied Chairman Mao's works with this question in mind and examined ourselves. Everyone said shamefully: the working class is made of steel, but we seek comfort and avoid hard work, what kind of steel are we? Everyone expressed a desire to learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, to learn their spirit of hard work and endurance. In several months of labor, we established deep class feelings with the poor and lower-middle peasants.

	Over the past year, our factory has taken in more than 200 peasant brothers to work in the factory. They said: over the past year, they not only learned technology in the factory but also, through working with the workers, learned some of the excellent qualities of the working class.

	Our practice over the past year has proven that the system of being both a worker and a peasant is a good one. This way, workers and peasants can learn from each other, deepen their feelings, and become all-around new-type laborers.

    工农结合育新人
    实践证明，亦工亦农是一个好制度。这样做，工农之间可以相互学习，增进感情，成为全面发展的新型劳动者。
    四川省温江专区氮肥厂工人　程光荣
    今年我们工厂跟附近的华严公社胜利大队挂钩，实行一部分工人轮流下乡当农民，一部分农民轮流进厂当工人的制度。
    第一批下乡当农民的工人，到了生产队，参加农业劳动，帮助农民办了技术夜校，首先跟农民一块学习毛泽东思想，以阶级斗争为纲来抓革命，促生产。我们到农村以后，就和社员们一块学习毛主席关于社会主义社会还存在阶级和阶级斗争的论述，经常注意批判资产阶级思想。第十生产队队长在薅秧时，采用高工分的办法来提高薅秧质量。我们就跟社员们一道学习《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》等文章，讨论了“究竟是为革命种田还是为工分种田”的问题。社员们批评了队长工分挂帅、物质刺激的做法，说那是资本主义的做法。大家提出了要学习白求恩，要为革命而种田。经过这场讨论，政治挂了帅，薅秧又快又好。
    我们厂里的职工，一块下到第十生产队共有四个人。下乡以后不久曾经发生了这样两件事：一件是有天早上三点钟，天下大雨，副队长喊大家起来把晒的麦草捆起来，我们四个人中有一个人想睡觉，没有起来参加这场劳动；另一件是我们开始劳动的头几天，干的是担挑活，肩膀担肿了，大家就都不愿担挑，却去找轻活干。这两件事，反映了我们头脑里还有资产阶级思想，于是大家就带着这个问题学习毛主席著作，检查自己。大家惭愧地说：工人阶级是硬骨头，可是我们贪图安逸，拈轻怕重，还算得什么硬骨头？大家表示要向贫下中农学习，学习他们那种吃苦耐劳的精神。在几个月的劳动中，我们跟贫下中农建立了深厚的阶级感情。
    一年以来，我们厂吸收了二百多农民兄弟进厂当工人。他们说：一年多以来，他们在工厂不仅学到了技术，而且通过跟工人一块劳动，学到了工人阶级的一些优秀品质。
    我们一年来的实践证明，亦工亦农是一个好制度。这样做，工农之间可以相互学习，增进感情，成为全面发展的新型劳动者。
