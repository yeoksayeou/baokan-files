Uphold Political Leadership, Oppose Profit-Seeking

Silk Reeling for the Revolution

To surpass world advanced levels in silk quality, we insist on learning from Chairman Mao's works, practicing basic skills with class hatred. We not only practice by the machines but also at home. Thus, we reel out first-class 7A uninterrupted and 8A grade high-quality raw silk on the 1930s silk reeling machines. Now, in the eleven indicators of silk quality, we have surpassed world advanced levels in ten items. This year, our factory was recommended as one of the national Daqing-style enterprises. All this is the result of the teachings of our dear Party and beloved Chairman Mao.

Listen, Sun Yefang, we are not working for money! We reel silk to accelerate the socialist revolution and construction in our country, to liberate all mankind, and to overthrow imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries. After surpassing quotas and quality standards, all comrades in our factory never ask for increased wages or bonuses. Sun Yefang, you want us to implement profit-seeking and material incentives, pfft, you are insulting our great working class! We unanimously believe: profit-seeking and material incentives are rotten revisionist things that corrupt our workers, and must be firmly opposed.

Burn Sun Yefang's Fallacies Completely

In the past few years, our canteen put "profit" first, focusing on dishes, making laborers dare not come to eat. By the end of 1964, through studying Chairman Mao's works, we put down the big shop's attitude, focusing on economical snacks, which were warmly welcomed by laborers. Since 1965, our canteen not only turned losses into profits but also made profits. The facts prove that Mao Zedong Thought is our compass. Sun Yefang wants us to leave Mao Zedong Thought to pursue "profit-seeking," this is a delusion! We must throw his fallacies into the furnace and burn them completely.

Sun Yefang's Poison is Like an Egg Hitting a Mountain

In the past, our team did not emphasize politics, only using material incentives to "improve" comrades' enthusiasm. Therefore, production did not leap forward, defective products piled up, comrades' thoughts were chaotic, and the whole team was in a state of paralysis. Later, according to the Party's instructions, we studied Chairman Mao's works, studied the People's Liberation Army, and studied Daqing. Everyone understood that working is revolution, so production continuously rose. The output and quality of crankshafts have been greatly improved. At the same time, our team implemented five innovations and achieved standardization. In 1965, our team was selected as a Five Good Team and attended the municipal model workers' meeting.

Serve the People with Postal and Telecommunications

Before liberation, Ningxia had fewer than twenty postal and telecommunications institutions, especially in rural areas where there were almost none. This was because the postal and telecommunications enterprises at that time served the exploiting class and pursued profits. After liberation, rural postal and telecommunications offices increased nearly tenfold, with thirty percent of them not covering their expenses. If we follow Sun Yefang's "profit-seeking" advocacy, these offices would have to be closed immediately. However, we cannot do this. Because our postal and telecommunications enterprises serve proletarian politics and the broad laboring people.

    坚持政治挂帅  反对利润挂帅
    缫丝为革命
    我们为了在生丝质量上全面赶超世界先进水平，坚持向毛主席著作请教，带着阶级仇恨苦练基本功。我们不但在机台旁练，而且回家后还是练。这样，我们就在三十年代的缫丝车上，缫出了世界第一流的7A无切断和8A等级的优质生丝。现在，我们在生丝质量的十一项指标上，已经有十项超过世界先进水平。今年，我们厂又被推荐为全国大庆式企业之一。这全是由于我们亲爱的党和敬爱的毛主席教导的结果。
    孙冶方，你听着，我们不是为钞票做工的！我们缫丝是为了加速我国社会主义革命和建设事业，是为了解放全人类，是为了打倒帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派。我们全厂同志在超过定额、超过质量指标以后，从来不要加工资或拿奖金。孙冶方，你要我们实行利润挂帅、物质刺激，呸，你这是污辱我们伟大的工人阶级！我们一致认为：利润挂帅、物质刺激是腐蚀我们工人的修正主义的臭东西，必须坚决反对。

    把孙冶方的臭谬论统统烧毁
    前些年，我们餐厅以“利润”当头，经营以盘菜为主，搞得劳动群众不敢进来吃饭。一九六四年底，我们通过大学毛主席著作，放下了大店的架子，以经营经济小吃为主，受到了劳动群众的热烈欢迎。从一九六五年以来，我们餐厅不但扭转了亏损，而且也有了盈利。事实证明，毛泽东思想是我们的方向盘。孙冶方要我们离开毛泽东思想去搞“利润挂帅”，这是妄想！我们一定要把他的那些臭谬论统统扔到炉膛里，彻底烧毁。
                      福建厦门东方红餐厅副政治指导员　吴雪珍
    孙冶方放毒不过是鸡蛋碰泰山
    过去，我们小组没有突出政治，只是用物质刺激来“提高”同志们的积极性。因此，生产跃不上去，废品一大堆，同志们的思想混乱，全组处于瘫痪状态。后来，我们根据党的指示，大学毛主席著作，大学解放军，大学大庆。大家懂得了做工就是干革命，因此，生产不断直线上升。曲轴的产量和质量都有了很大的提高。同时，我们小组还实现了五项革新，实行了样板化。一九六五年，我们小组被评选为五好班组，并出席了市群英会。
    孙冶方主张“利润挂帅”，就是妄想把我们工人变成利己主义者。他的这个阴谋只能像鸡蛋碰泰山一样，被我们砸得粉碎。

    为人民办邮电
    解放前，宁夏全区设立邮电机构的不足二十处，特别是广大农村更很少有邮电所。因为当时的邮电企业是为剥削阶级服务的，是为了追逐利润的。解放后，农村邮电所增加将近十倍，其中有百分之三十的邮电所收入不够支出。如果按照孙冶方的“利润挂帅”的主张，这些邮电所就要立即停办。但是，我们决不能这样做。因为我们的邮电企业是为无产阶级政治服务的，是为广大劳动人民服务的。
