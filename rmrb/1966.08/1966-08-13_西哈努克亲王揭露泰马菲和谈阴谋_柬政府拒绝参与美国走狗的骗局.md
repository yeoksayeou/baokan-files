Prince Sihanouk Exposes the Thai-Malaysian-Philippine Peace Talks Conspiracy
Cambodian Government Refuses to Participate in the American Puppets' Trick

According to the New China News Agency in Phnom Penh, on the 11th, the Head of State of Cambodia, Prince Sihanouk, made a statement to foreign journalists. He pointed out that the "conference" proposed by Thailand, the Philippines, "Malaysia," and others regarding the Vietnam issue is "an absurd farce." He said, this is not a conference, but a trick, and the Royal Government of Cambodia absolutely refuses to participate in this trick.

Prince Sihanouk said, Thailand is an American lackey, especially its Foreign Minister Thanat Khoman. He said, everyone knows that it is the American government that is persistently seeking to convene such a "conference."

The proposal by Thailand, the Philippines, and "Malaysia" to hold a so-called "Asian Seventeen-Nation Conference" to discuss the Vietnam issue was made under the instructions of American imperialism. After the Thai Foreign Minister Thanat Khoman proposed the establishment of an "Asian Committee" to "peacefully resolve" the Vietnam issue at the "Association of Southeast Asian Nations" ministerial meeting held in Bangkok on the 3rd, U.S. Secretary of State Rusk praised it as a "constructive proposal" on the 5th, and expressed the hope to take further action in this regard.

　　西哈努克亲王揭露泰马菲和谈阴谋
　　柬政府拒绝参与美国走狗的骗局
    据新华社金边十一日电　柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王十一日向外国记者发表谈话指出，泰国、菲律宾、“马来西亚”等建议召开的关于越南问题的“会议”，“是一场荒谬的丑剧”。他说，这不是一次会议，而是一个骗局，柬埔寨王国政府绝对拒绝参与这一骗局。
    西哈努克亲王说，泰国是美国的走狗，特别是它的外交部长他纳·科曼。他说，大家都知道，正是美国政府在一味谋求召开这样一次“会议”。
    泰国、菲律宾和“马来西亚”关于召开所谓亚洲“十七国”会议讨论越南问题的建议，是在美帝国主义的指使下提出的。当泰国外交部长科曼三日在曼谷举行的“东南亚联盟”部长会议上提出设立一个“亚洲委员会”来“和平解决”越南问题的建议后，美国国务卿腊斯克五日吹捧它是一个“建设性的建议”，并且表示希望在这方面采取进一步的行动。
