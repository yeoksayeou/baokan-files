The editorial note: The Huangshandong Production Brigade in Borou County, Guangdong Province, is a shining example of peasants actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works.

Many who have visited Huangshandong to learn and observe have praised: "In Huangshandong, peasants study Chairman Mao's works, achieving the goals of reading aloud, memorizing, and putting into practice. They can use basic viewpoints from Chairman Mao's works to analyze, answer, and solve problems. Mao Zedong Thought is being directly grasped by the peasants, fundamentally changing their worldview, sweeping away the old thoughts, old morals, and old customs left by the exploiting classes over thousands of years, and establishing new thoughts, new morals, and new customs of cultivating for revolution, selflessly serving the people, and having a global vision.

Comrade Lin Biao said: "Through the active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works, Mao Zedong Thought must be instilled into the workers and peasants to change the spiritual face of the laboring people and transform spiritual power into tremendous material force." The experience of Huangshandong peasants in actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works once again proves this is an unbreakable truth.

Currently, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our country is experiencing an unprecedented wave of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. Particularly exciting is that the vast number of peasants, taking the People's Liberation Army as their example, emphasize politics, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, making the entire rural landscape flourish. This is a significant event. Our country is a large country with over five hundred million peasants. If over five hundred million peasants actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works like the poor and lower-middle peasants of Huangshandong, arming themselves with Mao Zedong Thought to transform their subjective and objective worlds, it will have immeasurable and profound significance for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.

"Serious problems are educating the peasants." Now, the path to educating peasants has been found. This is to learn from the People's Liberation Army and use Mao Zedong Thought to educate and transform the peasants. The practice of peasants in Huangshandong, Stone Dam Commune, Borou County, Guangdong Province, studying Chairman Mao's works proves: once peasants are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, they can become a highly conscious, revolutionary, and proletarianized force. Over the past two years, Huangshandong peasants have persisted in actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to break free from all old thoughts and habits that reflect the old system, and their spiritual outlook is undergoing unprecedented great changes.

Read Chairman Mao's books every day, listen to Chairman Mao's words every sentence

Huangshandong Production Brigade is located in the Guishan mountainous area at the border of Borou and Heyuan counties, stretching fifty li with nothing but gullies. The entire brigade has nine production teams and one forestry farm, with over eight hundred people scattered across twenty-six small villages.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Huangshandong know from their own experiences that Chairman Mao's works are full of revolutionary truths, and they deeply love Chairman Mao's works. In the spring of 1964, Li Qing, a member of the brigade party branch committee (now deputy secretary) and militia captain, returned from the Huichang Military Sub-district's active militia meeting, bringing back a set of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" given to the Huangshandong militia by the Huichang Military Sub-district and fifty-six single-volume works of Chairman Mao he bought himself. The wish of Huangshandong peasants to study Chairman Mao's works began to be realized. Over the past two years, the brigade party branch has raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, first organizing party members, league members, and militia to study, and then expanding to all community members. In August 1964, the party branch conducted extensive propaganda and mobilization among the masses, quickly forming a wave of mass study of Chairman Mao's works. Now, over ninety percent of the community members participate in the study, and about eighty percent can persist in regular study.

The peasants of Huangshandong, with deep class feelings and strong revolutionary aspirations, study Chairman Mao's revolutionary truths with insatiable hunger. They overcome all difficulties to master Mao Zedong Thought. Look:

Chen Yalin of the Kuangsheng Production Team is an eighty-three-year-old old woman who cannot read. She studies Chairman Mao's works as seriously and actively as the young people. Every time there is a collective study session, she walks from the upper village to the lower village to participate, day after day. She says: "Thinking of the hardships of the past and the sweetness of today, the blessings of Chairman Mao are endless! As long as there is a breath, I must study; if I live to a hundred, I will study to a hundred." Ma Guanmei, a female community member of the Nankeng Production Team, is a mother of six children. Housework is overwhelming, and she often arrives late for collective study. Later, every study day, she simply prepares dinner and lunch at once. After work, she eats and goes to participate in the study. Even so, this illiterate woman can recite over twenty quotations from Chairman Mao without missing a word. She says: "I don't remember how many work points I did today, but I will remember Chairman Mao's words word for word." Zhang Laijiao, a community member of the Aoxia Production Team, also spoke a very profound and important truth. She said: "Chairman Mao said: 'Without the poor peasants, there would be no revolution.' Chairman Mao is right. If we poor peasants do not read Chairman Mao's books, we will not revolutionize."

Those who visit Huangshandong to learn and observe are all deeply admiring of the peasants' active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works. Recently, a comrade from the Women's Federation of Longchuan County visited Huangshandong for learning and observation, coming to the home of community member Chen Jinmei. Chen Jinmei greeted her warmly and quickly boiled hot water for her to bathe. She felt embarrassed to bother others and repeatedly said, "No, no." Chen Jinmei said to her: "We all come from the four seas and five lakes, for a common revolutionary goal, and have come together. You don't have to be polite." This comrade was deeply moved and was extremely inspired by Chen Jinmei, an ordinary rural woman, who could apply Chairman Mao's words to her words and deeds at any time.

It is not just Chen Jinmei; in Huangshandong, most community members study Chairman Mao's works and truly achieve the goals of reading aloud, memorizing, and putting into practice. In daily conversations, they try to use Chairman Mao's matching quotations. If someone speaks without using Chairman Mao's language, their words will be considered not weighty enough. No matter what the matter is, if it aligns with Chairman Mao's words, they firmly believe and act accordingly; if it does not align with Chairman Mao's words, they firmly resist and oppose it.

A fundamental change in worldview

After achieving collectivization and communalization, the means of production in Huangshandong Production Brigade have been publicized; after multiple political movements, the class consciousness of the peasants has significantly improved. However, "if one does not act for oneself, one will be punished by heaven and earth," "seeking three meals a day and a place to sleep at night," "each family sweeps in front of their own door and does not care about the frost on others' roofs," these old thoughts and consciousness from thousands of years of class society have not been completely eradicated from people's minds, and the core issue of "why live" in worldview has not been fundamentally solved. Helping peasants remove the spiritual shackles imposed on them by the exploiting classes of the old society and fully unleashing their revolutionary nature is a profound struggle to eliminate bourgeois ideology and promote proletarian ideology. In this struggle, the peasants of Huangshandong use Mao Zedong Thought as the most powerful weapon for self-revolution and have achieved great victories.

How did the peasants of Huangshandong achieve this victory? By studying the "Three Constantly Read Articles." They love to read the "Three Constantly Read Articles," repeatedly studying them without getting tired. Although the "Three Constantly Read Articles" are often studied, each study brings new content, and repeated study and application bring more sweetness, profoundly changing people's spiritual outlook.

Chen Jinfu, a poor peasant community member of the Dalupai Production Team, was once called a "spider-like person—selfless (silk) is not enough." In 1963, the team sent him to an abandoned mine to dig for ore. After finding the ore, he secretly buried it and lied to the production team, saying he had not found the ore sample. Who would have thought that during the Spring Festival holiday, he did not stay at home to celebrate the festival but secretly went to the mountain to pull out the ore to sell for money. He studied the lesson "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and his heart kept repeating the eight characters "selflessly serving the people." Why did a foreigner come to help the Chinese revolution? Why could Norman Bethune sacrifice everything? But he, a peasant of New China, was always scheming to make personal profits? Chen Jinfu thought more and more, feeling uncomfortable all over. He felt guilty towards the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. He made up his mind to break with selfish and self-serving thoughts. Thus, at a community member meeting, he confessed everything about how he hid the ore and made money, expressing his determination to make amends and become a selfless community member. Chen Jinfu indeed did what he said. In the past, he picked the easy tasks and rushed to finish them. Now, he takes the heaviest tasks and his work quality is one of the best in the team.

Let's talk about Ma Guanmei. In the past, she was very selfish, arguing over trivial matters with others, and community members were afraid of her. After studying "In the Service of the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune," she said: "Chairman Mao's words are all for me, all criticizing me. Compared to noble people, pure people, people with morality, people who have transcended low-level interests, people who are beneficial to the people, I am truly worlds apart." From then on, she decided to become a person beneficial to the people and voluntarily confessed her past mistakes of arguing with others and being selfish at a community member meeting.

Originally backward community members became advanced, and originally advanced community members? Tian Jin is an old accountant of the Huangkeng Production Team, over fifty years old. He has always been responsible and serious in his work. In 1963, once during a heavy rain, a newly built warehouse in the team leaked, and over a hundred catties of grain seeds were soaked. After the community members knew about this, they shouted: "Is Tian Jin confused, not even able to take care of the grain seeds in the new warehouse!" Tian Jin initially felt wronged. A new warehouse, who knows if it leaks or not? Later, he studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and Norman Bethune's spirit of "two extremes" moved him. He thought about the incident of the soaked grain seeds. Why didn't he check the new warehouse in advance? Why didn't he immediately go to check when it rained? Why did he later try to shift the blame? Compared to the spirit of "two extremes," how far apart is this! From then on, he strictly required himself in everything with the spirit of "extreme responsibility," treating the team's tools and products, even a rope or a tile, better than his own things.

The peasant masses of Huangshandong read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, thoroughly eliminating bourgeois ideology and establishing proletarian ideology. Chairman Mao said: "A change in worldview is a fundamental change." When the worldview changes, everything changes. The most powerful and sharpest weapon for fundamentally transforming one's worldview is Mao Zedong Thought!

A red heart for the collective

A few years ago, the state built a reservoir in Huangshandong, relocating all the people in the brigade outside the reservoir area. Later, due to the cultivable land in the reservoir area, over eight hundred people were mobilized to return to their homes in succession. This coming and going inevitably brought many difficulties to production and life. At this time, the peasants of Huangshandong, facing the serious task of rebuilding their homes, facing temporary difficulties in life, and facing the demonic winds stirred up by ghosts and snakes, some of them lost their direction of advancement, and a few even wanted to take the capitalist road. At this time, Chairman Mao's books came to Huangshandong. Chairman Mao's words, like a spring thunder, woke these people up.

When the poor peasant Gu Qing returned to his hometown, he worked day and night to clear the land and plant mountain ginger. His four mu of land could produce over three hundred catties of grain per harvest, making him the champion in single yield. At this time, Gu Qing's heart had only this "heart's meat." However, since studying Chairman Mao's works, he slowly changed. Once, he heard the instructor read "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and Chairman Mao criticized some people who "think of themselves first when facing a matter." This sentence hit him. He thought: "Chairman Mao's words are specifically criticizing me, Gu Qing. Norman Bethune, a Canadian, and a famous doctor, if he wanted to make money, such a famous doctor could earn enough to eat three stomachs, but he crossed the ocean to China to participate in the revolution and sacrificed his life for the Chinese people. I, Gu Qing, am a firefly, shining only three inches away, thinking only of myself." "I must learn from Comrade Norman Bethune to be selflessly serving the people!" Gu Qing made up his mind. After the autumn harvest, he eagerly ran to the team leader's house and said: "The land I opened is now returned to the collective!" The team leader was surprised and asked him why. He said: "It was Chairman Mao who, using Norman Bethune's scalpel, cut out my selfishness!"

Not only Gu Qing, but also in Huangshandong, there are 126 households who voluntarily returned 98 mu of cleared land according to the policy. Due to the cleared land, this "old difficult problem" that has been hard to properly handle for many years is now fundamentally solved from the root, that is, from people's thoughts.

Comparable to Gu Qing's cutting off his "heart's meat" is the story of twenty-six baskets becoming twenty-seven. The Aoxia Production Team has collectively bought a total of twenty-six baskets of bamboo since 1960, but only a dozen or so are placed in the storage room, and the rest are missing. The team leader held many meetings to solve the problem, but without results. One evening during the summer harvest, the instructor gave a class, explaining the quotation, "Make long-term plans for everything. Strictly prohibit the destruction of any public or private production materials and the waste of living materials, forbid extravagant eating and drinking, and pay attention to saving." As soon as the words were finished, someone sighed heavily, and someone lowered their head quietly, and the atmosphere in the meeting suddenly changed. The next morning, community member Li Hua was the first to return a basket to the production team. Then one basket, another basket, and a large storage room was filled with baskets. The accountant, Tian Shuifu, counted: exactly twenty-seven baskets! Why did twenty-six baskets become twenty-seven? It was later found that community member Gu Dingyou had taken a basket from the primary cooperative in 1955. That night, he heard the instructor read Chairman Mao's teaching of "selflessly serving the people," repeatedly blaming himself for being "salty-hearted," taking public property, and harming collective interests. Thus, he tidied up the long-hidden basket, replaced it with new bamboo shoots, and returned it to the team. Another community member, Zhang Yadi, also had her heart enlightened by Chairman Mao's words, returning a basket she had used since the primary cooperative to the collective.

The production team received several mu, half a mu of land, one basket, half a basket of bamboo; the community members gave up their "selfish and self-serving hearts." This is the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought shining on them, making them achieve brilliant victories in the thought revolution of eliminating bourgeois ideology and promoting proletarian ideology, in the worldview transformation of breaking private interests and establishing public interests!

Seeing all of China and the world

Huangshandong is a place with many mountains and fertile land, originally a good place for afforestation. However, in the past, whenever afforestation was mentioned, it became a deadlock. Some people said: "Afforestation is a hundred-year business, one cannot enjoy the benefits; planting sweet potatoes is planted in the current year and harvested in the current year." "There are mountains, so there is no need to worry about forests; if wood is needed, go to the mountain to cut it, there is no need to dig holes and open pits!" In the past two years, afforestation has become the most prosperous business in Huangshandong. Now, they say: "Cultivating for revolution, afforestation is also for revolution. We have few paddy fields and little surplus grain, contributing little to the revolution; we have many mountains and land, so we should contribute more effort to afforestation for the revolution!" They calculated which trees are most needed and useful for the country and the revolution? It is the Chinese fir and the tung tree. Saying is doing, after the Spring Festival this year, starting on the third day of the New Year, they spent nearly a month planting over fifty thousand Chinese fir seedlings and seventeen thousand tung trees.

The change in the understanding of the construction of the Huangshandong Reservoir by the community members of the Dingkeng Production Team also vividly illustrates their improved thinking and the process from small public to big public. The Dingkeng Production Team originally had over four hundred mu of fields, of which nearly three hundred mu were taken by the reservoir, and they were all fertile fields; although the state stipulated the supply of rationed grain, they still had many objections to the reservoir. The reservoir blocked their path to Shidian Market, and every time they went to the market, they had to take a detour of over ten li, and they would complain: "The reservoir made us take this detour." After studying Chairman Mao's works, everyone's hearts became clear. Last spring, Zhang Yanquan's relative from Shidian ran to visit him, and as soon as they sat down, they complained about the difficulties of the journey and casually blamed the reservoir. Zhang Yanquan disagreed, saying: "The reservoir is good! We are all for a common revolutionary goal, walking together, advancing in the same direction, what's the big deal with walking a few more steps?" This guest did not understand his words at first, so Zhang Yanquan added: "Dingkeng is only a few hundred mu of land, but after building the reservoir, the three thousand mu of fields downstream of Shidian have water, and the grain produced every year is many times more than Dingkeng, contributing more to the country! If the country does not suffer, Dingkeng will not suffer."

The peasants of Huangshandong, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, wholeheartedly for the public, everything for the revolution, everything for the people, link their labor and work with the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, wholeheartedly wanting to contribute all their strength to the revolution!

Be like the living Yugong, be a good comrade

Huangshandong is located in a mountainous area with tens of thousands of mu of land, but only over one thousand two hundred mu of cultivated land. Surrounded by high mountains and steep cliffs, everywhere are streams and stone beaches. After a small rain, the mountain torrents rush down. After liberation, the peasants of Huangshandong became the masters of their homes, but a considerable number of people still lacked spirit in the face of the harsh natural environment. They said: "Huangshandong has high mountains, bad water, thin soil, and poor people, with no future!"

After people's worldviews changed, the relationship between people and nature also changed. Now, the mountains of Huangshandong are still those mountains, and the water is still that water, but people's views have completely changed. They say: "The mountains of Huangshandong are high, and every side is a meat mountain. The water of Huangshandong is bad, but it has great power for generating electricity. We must turn Huangshandong into a gold mine."

The Dalupai Production Team has little land and many people. In 1962 and 1963, the team leader, Zhu Guanying, proposed twice to go to the Shixianwei slope to clear the land and expand cultivation. However, the community members felt that the place was far away, lacked water sources, and had many wild beasts. They said: "The fields in front of the door, just add more fertilizer, why go so far to the mountain to clear the land?" On an evening in April 1964, the team studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." Zhu Guanying asked: "Yugong dared to move two big mountains, do we dare to go to Shixianwei to clear the land?" The old issue was raised again, but people's reactions were completely different. "Go! We dare to go! We want to be living Yugong!" "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, striving for victory. Even if the grass head is bigger than the rice basket, we have ways to deal with it!" This study session turned into a determination meeting, turning into a mobilization meeting for marching to the wasteland. The next morning, this production team with only fourteen households and over twenty labor forces mobilized over forty people. Usually, old people who stay at home to take care of children and students on vacation also came. Someone advised them not to go, and their response was: "Chairman Mao said, 'The more difficult the place, the more we should go, this is a good comrade.' We want to be good comrades!"

The Aoxia Production Team has a field located in Machengdu, seven or eight li away from the village. Going to Machengdu to cultivate, one has to cross four rivers and climb three mountains. The fields in Machengdu are all terraced fields, with small plots and many stones, making cultivation very laborious. Therefore, every year, when it was time to go to Machengdu to transplant seedlings, many community members would find excuses to avoid it. In early 1963, when the early cultivation began, the team leader thought that "with great rewards, there must be brave men," announcing that anyone who went to Machengdu, regardless of age, would be rewarded with one duck egg and one catty of rice. Did it work? No. The entire team of over forty labor forces had only seventeen or eighteen young people showing up. The next day, the team leader decided to double the "reward," but it did not work, and the number of people going actually decreased. After studying Chairman Mao's works, people's hearts were filled with red flags, and going to Machengdu to transplant seedlings became a lively and joyful event in Aoxia, no longer needing to reward duck eggs, rice, and work points.

Everyone strives to be a "living Yugong," everyone strives to be a "good comrade," relying on this spirit and tenacity. The Huangshandong Production Brigade, with only over eight hundred people and over three hundred labor forces, in the past two years, has built two roads totaling over fifty li, newly built and repaired one hundred eighty-five rooms, twenty-eight warehouses, five school buildings, ninety-five cow sheds, pigsties, and toilets, plus water conservancy projects, investing a total of thirty thousand work points. Last year, the paddy field area expanded from seven hundred fifteen mu in 1960 to nine hundred forty-five mu, with a single yield increase of over ninety percent, and the total yield doubled. They planted over two thousand mu of Chinese fir, tung trees, bamboo, and fruit trees. Here, people cannot help but enthusiastically shout: People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force and the greatest productive force!

Sweeping away the poison of the old society

The Dalupai Production Team has fourteen households, except for one landlord, the other thirteen are poor and lower-middle peasants. Among the thirteen households, there are six surnames: Cai, Huang, Gu, Luo, Chen, and Li, of which five surnames and ten households moved from Aoxia, Nankeng, and four other places after land reform. Land reform overthrew the feudal system, but the feudal clan consciousness, clan boundaries, and household boundaries reflecting the feudal system still exist. Same household and same surname people want to work together, and neighbors on the left and right do not get along, making the team cadres very troubled, seriously affecting the collective's fighting strength. After learning the spirit of "selflessly serving the people" from Comrade Norman Bethune, people examined their past selfishness and also linked it to this abnormal phenomenon. At this time, the instructor organized everyone to study a quotation from Chairman Mao: "We all come from the four seas and five lakes, for a common revolutionary goal, and have come together.... All revolutionary comrades must care for each other, love each other, and help each other." This made them deeply touched. They said: "The community members of Dalupai are indeed from the 'four seas and five lakes,' five surnames from four places, why can't we care for each other, love each other, help each other, and advance towards a common revolutionary goal?" Many community members said: We are all people saved by the Party and Chairman Mao, we are class brothers. Whether we unite or not, this is not a small matter, but a matter of whether we have class feelings, a matter of whether we can walk the road to common prosperity, a matter of whether we listen to Chairman Mao's words!

Now, in Huangshandong, "returning lost property" has become an ordinary thing. In the past, husbands beating wives and worshipping ghosts were very common. Now, these remnants of the feudal clan system's "husband's power" and "god's power" have been eliminated. When someone dies in the village, everyone holds a memorial service and sends wreaths, and the elderly are very happy. Singing vulgar mountain songs and speaking obscene language have become low-level interests that everyone resists. Now, what is popular is reading the red book and singing red songs. Every mountain village is filled with revolutionary songs. Do not underestimate these things. All old thoughts, old cultures, old customs, and old habits are poisons used by the exploiting classes to poison the people. Now, due to Mao Zedong Thought, a cultural revolution to eliminate the poison of thousands of years of class society has begun in Huangshandong!

Never forget class struggle

"The enemy without guns still exists after the enemy with guns is eliminated, and they will inevitably fight to the death with us. We must not underestimate these enemies. If we do not raise and recognize the problem in this way now, we will make a big mistake." The peasants of Huangshandong have studied this quotation many times. Every time they study, the instructor reminds everyone of the reactionary words and deeds of class enemies in their village and other villages. The class enemies have been overthrown, but they are still alive, their hearts are not dead, and they are still fighting to the death with us! The peasants of Huangshandong deeply feel that Chairman Mao's teachings are absolutely true. They hold a deep hatred for the class enemies, maintaining high revolutionary vigilance, and never forget that there is class struggle beside them!

The peasants of Huangshandong not only know that there are still unrepentant enemies beside them but also know that there are imperialists outside; not only know that they must defend the people's mountains and the socialist mountains but also know that they must support the world revolution. After studying the quotation, "The imperialists bully us like this, which needs to be seriously dealt with. We not only need a strong regular army, but we also need to establish militia regiments. This way, when the imperialists invade our country, they will find it difficult to move," their awareness has been raised. They often say: "Do not think that Huangshandong cannot hear the sound of cannons. Taiwan is not yet liberated, and three-fifths of the laboring people in the world are not yet liberated."

They never forget class struggle, so they never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forget to hold the gun in their hands. Men, women, old, and young all regard joining the army, establishing militia regiments, carrying guns to defend the mountains, and carrying guns for the world revolution as the most glorious thing. Now, the militia of Huangshandong are not only the backbone of studying Chairman Mao's works but also the main force of production, and they have trained the ability to fight within two hundred meters, truly achieving "call them and they come, come and they can fight, fight and they can win."

The achievements of Huangshandong peasants in actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works once again vividly prove: Mao Zedong Thought is boundless! Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, it will become a tremendous material force! The new era of workers, peasants, and soldiers directly grasping and applying Marxism-Leninism has begun! All revolutionary people around the world are cheering for us to open up this new historical era! Let the imperialists, modern revisionists, reactionaries of all countries, and the handful of ghosts and snakes within the country tremble! We will raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher and stride forward bravely!

    毛泽东思想威力无穷
    ——广东省博罗县黄山洞农民在革命化的道路上奋勇前进
    编者按：广东省博罗县黄山洞大队，是农民群众活学活用毛主席著作的一面红旗。
    许多到过黄山洞参观学习的人，都称赞说：在黄山洞，农民群众学习毛主席著作，做到读在嘴上，记在心上，落实在行动上。他们都能引用毛主席著作中的一些基本观点来分析问题，回答问题和解决问题。毛泽东思想正在为农民群众直接掌握，正在使农民的世界观发生根本的变化，一扫几千年来剥削阶级遗留下来的旧思想，旧道德，旧风俗，树立起为革命种田，毫不利己专门利人，胸怀祖国放眼世界的新思想，新道德，新风尚。
    林彪同志说：“必须通过活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的思想灌输到工人、农民中去，才能改变劳动人民的精神面貌，才能使精神力量转化为巨大的物质力量。”黄山洞农民活学活用毛主席著作的经验，又一次证明了这是一条颠扑不破的真理。
    当前，在无产阶级文化大革命中，我国正在掀起一个前所未有的活学活用毛主席著作新高潮。特别令人兴奋的是：广大农民以人民解放军为榜样，突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，照毛主席的指示办事，使整个农村面貌呈现一片欣欣向荣的景象。这是一件了不起的大事。我国是一个大国，有五亿多农民。五亿多农民都像黄山洞广大贫下中农这样活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，改造自己的主观世界和客观世界，对于中国革命和世界革命，将有不可估量的深远意义。
      “严重的问题是教育农民。”现在，教育农民的路子走出来了。这就是大学人民解放军，用毛泽东思想教育农民、改造农民。广东省博罗县石坝公社黄山洞大队农民学习毛主席著作的实践证明：农民一经用毛泽东思想武装起来，就可以变成一支具有共产主义觉悟的、非常革命化、非常无产阶级化的队伍。两年来，黄山洞农民坚持活学活用毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想为武器，冲决一切反映旧制度的旧思想、旧习惯的束缚，精神面貌正在经历着史无前例的大变化。
    毛主席的书天天读  毛主席的话句句听
    黄山洞大队，处在博罗、河源两县交界的桂山山区，横直五十里，尽是山沟沟，全大队有九个生产队，一个林场，共八百多人，散居在二十六个小村子里。
    黄山洞广大的贫下中农从自己的切身经验中知道，毛主席著作中讲的都是革命道理，他们非常热爱毛主席著作。一九六四年春天，大队党支部委员（现任党支部副书记）、民兵营长李清到惠阳军分区开完民兵积极分子会议，带着惠阳军分区送给黄山洞民兵的一套《毛泽东选集》和他自己买来的五十六本毛主席著作单行本，回到黄山洞。黄山洞农民学习毛主席著作的愿望开始实现了。两年来，大队党支部高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，先组织党员、团员和民兵学，随即发展到全体社员学。一九六四年八月间，党支部在群众中进行大宣传、大发动，大搞群众运动，迅即形成群众学习毛主席著作的热潮。现在，全大队百分之九十以上的社员都参加学习，百分之八十左右的社员能够坚持经常学习。
    黄山洞的农民，怀着无比深厚的阶级感情和强烈的革命愿望，来学习毛主席的革命真理。他们如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作，什么困难都难不倒，一定要把毛泽东思想学到手。请看吧：
    对坑生产队的陈亚林，是个八十三岁的老太婆，又不识字，学习毛主席著作跟青年人一样认真、积极。每逢集体学习，她从上村走到下村去参加，两年如一日。她说：“想起过去的日子那样苦，今天的日子这样甜，毛主席的恩情说不完！只要还有一口气就要学，活到一百岁就学到一百岁。”南坑生产队女社员马观妹，是六个孩子的母亲，家务忙不过来，集体学习常常迟到。后来，每逢学习那天，她索性把晚饭和午饭一次做好，下午收工回来，吃了饭就去参加学习。就是这样，这个不识字的妇女，能够一字不漏地背出二十多条毛主席语录。她说：“我一天做了多少工分无心记，毛主席的话我要句句记在心。”坳下生产队社员张来娇，还讲出了一个非常深刻、非常重要的道理，她说：“毛主席说：‘没有贫农，便没有革命。’毛主席说得真好。我们贫农如果不读毛主席的书，就不会革命。”
    到黄山洞参观学习的人，都为这里农民活学活用毛主席著作，学得好，用得好，无限钦佩。最近，龙川县妇联的一位同志到黄山洞参观学习，来到社员陈进娣家里。陈进娣一见面就十分亲切，连忙烧热水给她洗澡。她觉得不好意思麻烦别人，连声说：“不要，不要。”陈进娣对她说：“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。你不要客气。”这位同志听了深受感动，她为陈进娣这样一个普通的农村妇女，能够随时随地把毛主席的话运用到自己的言行中感奋万分。
    不只是一个陈进娣，在黄山洞，大多数的社员学毛主席著作，都真正做到读在嘴上，记在心上，落实在行动上。人们平时讲话，都尽量使用毛主席的对口语录。谁讲话不用毛主席的语言，他的话就会被认为分量不够重。不论什么事情，凡是同毛主席的话符合的，他们就坚信不疑，坚决照办；凡是同毛主席的话不符合的，就坚决抵制，坚决反对。
    世界观的转变是一个根本的转变
    黄山洞大队在实现集体化、公社化以后，生产资料归公了；经过多次政治运动，农民的阶级觉悟有了很大的提高。但是，“人不为己，天诛地灭”，“日求三餐，夜求一宿”，“各家自扫门前雪，不管他人瓦上霜”，这些几千年阶级社会的旧思想旧意识，还没有在人们的脑子里清除干净，“活着为什么”这个世界观的核心问题还没有根本解决。帮助农民解除旧社会剥削阶级强加于他们身上的精神枷锁，把他们的革命本性充分发挥出来，这是一场深刻的灭资兴无的思想革命。在这场斗争中，黄山洞农民把毛泽东思想作为自我革命的最强大武器，赢得了伟大的胜利。
    黄山洞农民是怎样赢得这个胜利的呢？是学习“老三篇”。他们最爱读“老三篇”，反复学习，百读不厌。“老三篇”虽然经常学，但每次学习都带着活思想，具有新内容，反复学，反复用，越学越有甜头，人的精神面貌起了深刻的变化。
    大路排生产队贫农社员陈进福，是个被称做“蜘蛛形——无私（丝）不行”的人。一九六三年，队里派他去废矿场挖矿，找到矿石后，他偷偷地埋了起来，回到生产队撒谎说没有找到矿苗。谁知到了春节假期，他却连节日也不在家里过，偷偷上山把矿拉出来卖了赚钱。他学了《纪念白求恩》这一课，心里老是默默念着“毫不利己专门利人”这八个字。为什么一个外国人要来帮助中国革命？为什么白求恩能够牺牲自己的一切？而自己是个新中国的农民却整天挖空心思，为个人发财打算？陈进福越想越觉得周身不自在，他感到对不起共产党，对不起毛主席。他下定决心，要跟自私自利思想一刀两断。于是在一次社员大会上，把自己如何瞒矿贪财的事一五一十地说了出来，表示从此要将功补过，做个大公无私的社员。陈进福果然说到做到。过去，他干活挑肥拣瘦，贪工抢快，现在，凡是最重的活他抢着干，活计质量是全队数一数二的好。
    再说说马观妹。过去，她私心很重，芝麻大点的事情就跟人家吵半天，社员都怕她。学习了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》之后，她说：“毛主席的话句句是对我说的，句句都在批评我，对比高尚的人、纯粹的人、有道德的人、脱离了低级趣味的人、有益于人民的人，我真是差天隔地了。”从此，她决心做个有益于人民的人，并主动在社员大会上检讨了自己过去和人家吵架、自私自利等错误。
    原来比较落后的社员变成先进了，原来比较先进的社员又怎样呢？田金是黄坑生产队的老保管员，五十多岁。他做保管工作，一贯认真负责。一九六三年，有一次下大雨，队里一个新建仓库漏了水，有百多斤谷种淋湿了。社员知道这件事以后嚷开了：“田金是不是老糊涂了，连新仓库的谷种也没有保管好！”田金开始听了感到受了委屈。新仓库嘛，谁知它漏雨不漏雨呢？后来，他学习了《纪念白求恩》，白求恩“两个极端”的精神感动了他。他想起淋湿谷种这件事来。为什么事先不检查一下新仓库呢？为什么下雨了，我不立刻跑去看看呢？为什么事后我又极力推卸责任呢？这跟“两个极端”的精神对比起来差得多么远呵！从此以后，他时时事事处处都以“极端的负责任”的严格要求来要求自己，对待队里的农具、产品，那怕是一根绳、一片瓦，他保管得比自己家里的东西还要好。
    黄山洞的农民群众，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，大破资产阶级思想，大立无产阶级思想。毛主席说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。世界观变了，一切都跟着变。实现人的世界观的根本改造的最强大、最锐利的武器，就是毛泽东思想！
    一颗红心为集体
    几年前，国家在黄山洞建设水库，把全大队的人都安排搬迁到水库区外去。以后，由于水库区还有不少可耕的土地，又动员了八百多人陆续重返家园。这样一出一进，难免给生产和生活带来不少困难。这时候，黄山洞的农民，面对重建家园的严重任务，面对生活上的暂时困难，面对牛鬼蛇神的兴风作浪，他们当中有一部分人，迷失了前进的方向，有少数人还想走资本主义道路。这时，毛主席的书来到了黄山洞。毛主席的话，像一声春雷，把这些人震醒过来。
    贫农古清重返家园时，日日夜夜埋头开荒，种山姜。他开的四分地一造可以收三百多斤谷，论单产是全队之冠。这时的古清，心里就只有这块“心头肉”了。可是，自从学习毛主席著作以来，他慢慢变了。有一次，他听辅导员念《纪念白求恩》，毛主席批评有些人“一事当前，先替自己打算”，这句话打中了他。他想：“毛主席这句话是专门批评我古清的。白求恩同志是加拿大人，又是个著名的医生，如果为了赚钱，这样著名的医生，赚到三个肚皮也吃不完的，可是，他却漂洋过海到中国来参加革命，为了我们中国人民献出了生命。我古清呢，十足是萤火虫，照不到三寸远，专为自己打算。”“要学白求恩同志那样，毫不利己专门利人！”古清的决心下定了，去年秋熟作物收完以后，他兴冲冲地跑到队长家里说：“我开的地，现在交还给集体啦！”队长惊讶地问他为什么？他说：“是毛主席借白求恩那把手术刀，把我的私心挖掉啦！”
    听了毛主席的话挖掉私心的，不只是古清一个人，黄山洞还有一百二十六户人家，自动按照政策规定，交出了开荒地九十八亩。由于开荒地所引起的公私矛盾，这个多年来不容易妥善处理的“老大难”问题，现在从根本上，即从人的思想上完满地解决了。
    和古清割掉“心头肉”相媲美的，还有一个二十六担箩变二十七担的故事。坳下生产队从一九六○年起，集体前后一共买了二十六担竹箩，但放在保管室的只有十多担，其余都不见了。队长召开过多次会来解决，没有结果。去年夏收大忙到来的一天晚上，学习辅导员上课，讲解了“一切作长期打算。严禁破坏任何公私生产资料和浪费生活资料，禁止大吃大喝，注意节约”这条语录，话刚讲完，有人重重地叹一口气，有人悄悄地低下头，会场的气氛突然变了。第二天一早，社员李华兴，第一个把一担竹箩交回给生产队。跟着你一担，他一担，好大一间保管室摆满了竹箩。保管员田水友清点了一下：足足二十七担！为什么二十六担箩会变成二十七担？事后才查明，原来社员古丁友在一九五五年曾经拿了初级社的一只箩。那天晚上，他听辅导员念毛主席的“毫不利己专门利人”的教导，不断责备自己“心肝咸”，拿了公家的箩，损害集体利益。于是，他把这只私藏已久的竹箩，收拾好，换上了新箩笋，送还给队。另一个社员张亚娣，心里也被毛主席的话拨亮，把在初级社时占用到现在的一只箩，送还给集体。
    生产队收到的是几分、一亩的土地，一担、半担的竹箩；社员们交出去的，却是“自私自利之心”。这是毛泽东思想的光辉照耀着他们，使他们在灭资兴无的思想大革命中，在破私立公的世界观改造中，取得了光辉的胜利！
    看到全中国全世界
    黄山洞山多地肥，原是绿化造林的好地方。可是，过去一提起造林就成了僵局。有些人说：“造林是百岁业，自己享不到好处；种番薯是当年种当年收。”“有山不愁没林，要用木材，上山去砍就行，用不着去挖洞开坑！”这两年，造林却成了黄山洞最兴旺的事业。现在，他们说：“耕田为革命，造林也是为革命。我们稻田不多，余粮很少，对革命贡献也小；我们山多地多，那就应该在植树造林方面为革命多出一点气力！”“为革命造林，就要造对国家最需要、对革命最有用的。”他们盘算，哪些树对国家、对革命最需要、最有用？是杉树，是油桐。说干就干，今年春节一过，年初三那天开始，花了近一个月的时间，种下五万多株杉树，一万七千多株油桐。
    丁坑生产队社员们对修黄山洞水库的认识的变化，也生动地说明了他们思想提高，从小公到大公的过程。丁坑生产队原来有四百多亩田，修水库占去了近三百亩，而且都是肥田；国家虽然规定供应他们统销粮，但他们对水库还是意见很大。水库截断了他们到石坝墟的通道，每逢赴墟要绕路多走十几里，他们就发牢骚说：“修了水库要我们多跑这段冤枉路”。自从学习毛主席著作后，大家心里豁然开朗。去年春天，社员张燕泉的亲戚，从石坝跑来探望他，一坐下来，就诉说路途阻隔之苦，顺便也埋怨水库一下。张燕泉可不同意，他说：“修水库好得很嘛！我们都是为了一个共同的革命目标，走在一起，朝一个方向前进的，多走几步路，有什么要紧？”这位客人一时还听不懂他讲的道理，于是张燕泉补充说：“丁坑再大也不过是这几百亩地，建了水库，石坝下游那三万多亩田，要水有水，年年增产的粮食比丁坑不知多了多少倍，对国家贡献更大嘛！对国家不吃亏，我们丁坑就不吃亏。”
    黄山洞的农民，就是这样在毛泽东思想的指引下，一心为公，一切为革命，一切为人民，把自己的劳动、自己的工作，同中国革命和世界革命联系起来，全心全意要为革命贡献出自己的一切力量！
    当活愚公　做好同志
    黄山洞地处山区，面积有几万亩，耕地却只有一千二百多亩。四面都是高山峻岭，到处都是溪涧石滩，一场小雨，山洪就汹涌而下。解放后，黄山洞的农民当家作主了，但是，相当一部分人面对恶劣的自然环境，精神还是不够振作的。他们说：“黄山洞山高、水恶、地瘦、人穷，没有前途！”
    人的世界观改变了以后，人同自然的关系也就变了。现在，黄山洞的山还是那些山，水还是那些水，但人们的看法全变了。他们说：“黄山洞的山高，面面是肉山。黄山洞的水恶，用来发电力量大。定要把黄山洞变成黄金洞。”
    大路排生产队田少人多。在一九六二年和一九六三年，生产队长朱观英曾两次提出要到石涧尾那块山坡上开荒扩种。可是社员们觉得那里路远，水源缺，野兽多。他们说：“屋门口的田，多施点肥就行了，何必到那么远的山上开荒？”一九六四年四月的一个晚上，队里学习《愚公移山》。朱观英问道：“愚公敢把两座大山移走，我们敢不敢去石涧尾开荒？”旧事重提，人们的反应却完全两样。“去！我们敢去！我们要当活愚公！”“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。就算茅草头比打禾桶还大，我们也有办法对付！”这一次学习会，变成了表决心大会，变成了向荒地进军的动员大会。第二天一早，这个只有十四户人家、二十多个劳动力的生产队，一共出动了四十多人。平日在家带小孩的老人，放假在家的小学生都来了。有人劝他们不要去，他们的回答是：“毛主席说，‘越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。’我们要做好同志！”
    坳下生产队有一块田，位置在马坑肚，离村有七、八里路远。到马坑肚耕田，要趟四道河，翻三个山。马坑肚的田尽是梯田，田块小，石头多，耕作起来十分辛苦。所以年年造造，轮到要到马坑肚插秧，许多社员总是借故规避。一九六三年早造开耕的时候，队长以为“重赏之下必有勇夫”，宣布凡是去马坑肚的，不论老老少少，每人奖鸭蛋一个，米一斤。灵不灵？不灵。全队四十多个劳动力，只有十七、八个青年人出勤。第二天，队长又决定加倍“奖励”，更不灵，去的人反倒减少了。学习毛主席著作以后，人们心里插了红旗，到马坑肚插秧竟成为坳下闹哄哄的喜庆事，再也不用奖什么鸭蛋、大米和工分了。
    人人争当“活愚公”，人人争做“好同志”，就靠这股干劲，这种硬骨头精神。只有八百多人、三百多个劳动力的黄山洞大队，在这两年多的时间里，修通两条共长五十多里的山路，新建和修建了一百八十五间房屋，二十八座仓库，五间校舍，九十五间牛栏、猪舍、厕所，加上修水利，一共投了三万个工。去年水稻面积从一九六○年的七百一十五亩扩大到九百四十五亩，单产增加了九成多，总产翻了一番多。种了杉、桐、竹子、果树等二千多亩。在这里，人们不禁热情欢呼：用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是最大的战斗力，最大的生产力！
    扫除旧社会的遗毒
    大路排生产队，十四户人，除了一户地主，十三户都是贫下中农。十三户人，有蔡、黄、古、罗、陈、李六个姓，其中五姓十户是土改后从坳下、南坑等四个地方搬来的。土改把封建制度推翻了，可是，反映封建制度的宗法观念，族界、姓界、房界观念，仍然存在。同房同姓的要在一起干活，左邻右舍闹不团结，弄得队干部很棘手，严重地影响了集体的战斗力。学了白求恩同志的“毫不利己专门利人”的精神以后，人们检查过去顾私不顾公的同时，也联系到了这种不正常的现象。这时，辅导员组织大家学一条毛主席的语录：“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。……一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”这使他们感触极深。他们说：“大路排的社员正是来自‘五湖四海’，五个姓从四个地方搬来的，为什么我们不能互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助，向共同的革命目标前进？”不少社员说：我们都是党和毛主席解救出来的受苦人，是阶级兄弟。我们团结不团结，这不是小事，而是有没有阶级感情的问题，是关系到能不能走共同富裕的道路的问题，是听不听毛主席的话的问题！
    现在，在黄山洞，“拾金不昧”已经成了一件普通的事。过去丈夫打老婆、敬神信鬼很普遍。现在，这些封建宗法制度遗留下来的“夫权”、“神权”的残余，已经被扫除。村里死了人，大家开追悼会，送花圈，老人们看了，十分高兴。唱黄色山歌，讲下流话，已成为人人抵制的“低级趣味”。现在兴的是看红书，唱红歌。座座山村，到处革命歌声嘹亮。千万不要小看这些事情。一切旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，都是剥削阶级用来毒害人民的毒药，现在由于有了毛泽东思想，一场扫除几千年来阶级社会遗毒的文化大革命，已在黄山洞开始了！
      念念不忘阶级斗争
    “在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。如果我们现在不是这样地提出问题和认识问题，我们就要犯极大的错误。”黄山洞农民学习这条语录，反复学了许多次。每次学习，辅导员就拿本村和外村的阶级敌人的反动言行来提醒大家。阶级敌人被打倒了，但他们人还在，心不死，还在和我们作拚死的斗争！黄山洞农民深深地体会到，毛主席的教导千真万确。他们对阶级敌人怀着满腔怒火，保持着高度的革命警惕，时刻不忘身边就有阶级斗争！
    黄山洞农民不仅知道身边还有不死心的敌人，而且知道外部还有帝国主义；不仅知道要保人民的江山，社会主义的江山，而且知道还要支援世界革命。他们学习了“帝国主义者如此欺负我们，这是需要认真对付的。我们不但要有强大的正规军，我们还要大办民兵师。这样，在帝国主义侵略我国的时候，就会使他们寸步难行”这条语录之后，提高了觉悟。他们常说：“不要以为黄山洞听不到炮声。台湾还没有解放哩，世界上还有三分之二的劳动人民没有解放哩。”
    他们念念不忘阶级斗争，因此，他们念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘紧握手中枪。男女老少，都把参军，把大办民兵，为保江山扛枪，为世界革命扛枪，当作最光荣的事。现在，黄山洞的民兵，既是学习毛主席著作的骨干，又是生产的主力军，还练就二百米内的过硬功夫，真正做到“召之即来，来之能战，战之能胜”。
                      ×××
    黄山洞农民活学活用毛主席著作的成果，再一次生动地证明：毛泽东思想威力无穷！毛泽东思想一经被广大工农兵群众掌握，就会变成巨大的物质力量！工农兵群众直接掌握和运用马克思列宁主义的新纪元开始了！全世界革命人民都在为我们开创这个历史新纪元而欢呼！让帝国主义、现代修正主义、各国反动派以及国内一小撮反党反社会主义的牛鬼蛇神发抖吧！我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗奋勇前进！
