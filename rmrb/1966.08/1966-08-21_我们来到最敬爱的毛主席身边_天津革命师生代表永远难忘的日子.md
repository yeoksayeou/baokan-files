From the banks of the Songhua River, from the Pearl River Delta, and from all over the country, many revolutionary teachers and students from various schools, with hearts full of boundless love for the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, came to the great heart of our motherland—Beijing. They yearned to see our most, most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, to report to him the new victories of the Cultural Revolution.

The road to Beijing was filled with the songs of revolution. When it rained on the way to Beijing, the revolutionary teachers and students from Tianjin sang "The East Is Red" and "The Boat Needs a Helm." Singing these two songs made them think of Chairman Mao; thinking of Chairman Mao gave them strength. When their feet blistered, they read a few quotations from Chairman Mao, or sometimes sang "The Red Army Is Not Afraid of Long Marches."

The working class is the most steadfast support for revolutionary teachers and students. A Tianjin automobile worker, hearing that the revolutionary students were walking to Beijing, drove his car to catch up with the team, threw two raincoats, and drove away. To this day, the students still don't know how to return the raincoats to their owner. An old worker from the Tianjin High-Pressure Pump Valve Factory rode his bicycle to catch up with the revolutionary student representatives from Tianjin University, bringing four cornbreads: "Eat these on your journey. Boys, always follow Chairman Mao!" The students asked him to write a few words to keep as a memento. He wrote sixteen characters: "Hope you will use your skills for the workers, peasants, and soldiers in the future!"

The students carried the heavy responsibility of all revolutionary teachers and students in Tianjin, with the earnest hopes of the working class in their hearts, and walked quickly towards Beijing and towards Chairman Mao.

When they reached Yangcun, an exciting piece of news came: Chairman Mao had sent a train to pick them up! "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao!" Slogans echoed through the sky of Yangcun, with many people jumping, laughing, and shedding tears of joy.

In Beijing, the revolutionary teachers and students from various schools warmly welcomed the comrades from outside.

On August 17th, an even more exciting piece of news came: a celebration of the Cultural Revolution would be held at Tiananmen Square on the 18th. That evening, some revolutionary students who were scattered in various schools in Beijing held a rally. "Tomorrow, where will we go, and who might we see!" They held up portraits of Chairman Mao and wrote large, neat "Long Live Chairman Mao" banners. The revolutionary students couldn't wait and started drumming and marching towards Tiananmen that very night.

On the morning of the 18th, the sun rose, and our most red, most red sun in our hearts—Chairman Mao—appeared on the Tiananmen rostrum. "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" Slogans echoed through the square, through Beijing, through all of China, and through the world.

"Why did I cry when I saw Chairman Mao? My father was a poor peasant who suffered greatly under the landlords. It was the Party and Chairman Mao who liberated us. Dad often told me: Chairman Mao is our savior. For so many years, I have longed to see Chairman Mao! My wish has finally come true, and I am by Chairman Mao's side. Joy and excitement made me cry. This is the happiest day of my life. I will definitely always, always follow Chairman Mao's words, remember the expectations and encouragement of Comrade Lin Biao and Premier Zhou Enlai on the 18th, and be a good successor to the cause of the proletarian revolution!" This is what a female student from Xingang Middle School said to a reporter afterward.

Chairman Mao inspected Tianjin University on August 13, 1958. This was the most glorious and memorable day for Tianjin University. Now, the revolutionary students of Tianjin University use "August 13" to name their "Red Guards." On August 18th, the "August 13 Red Guards" were also with Chairman Mao. They had a poem to offer to the great leader and teacher, which included a segment:

We Red Guards,
Have only one belief—
To defend the Party Central Committee!
To defend Chairman Mao!
We Red Guards,
Have only one resolve—
To carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!
For the noble cause of communism,
Forever revolutionary, forever fighting, forever following Chairman Mao!

    我们来到最敬爱的毛主席身边
    ——天津革命师生代表永远难忘的日子
    从松花江畔，从珠江三角洲，从全国各地，许多学校的革命师生代表，怀着对党中央和毛主席的无限热爱的心情，来到伟大祖国的心脏——北京。他们渴望着见到我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席，向毛主席汇报无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利。
    通向北京的路，是响彻革命歌声的路。天津革命师生在奔向北京的途中下了雨，他们就唱起《东方红》《大海航行靠舵手》。唱起这两支歌，就想起毛主席；想起毛主席，就有了力量。脚上起泡了，他们读几条毛主席语录，有时就唱起《红军不怕远征难》的歌。
    工人阶级是革命师生最坚强的后盾。天津一个汽车工人，听说革命师生要步行到北京，便开着车追赶队伍，扔下两件雨衣，就把车开走了。至今，同学们也不知道怎样才能把雨衣送还主人。天津市高压泵阀厂的一位老工人，骑着自行车赶上天津大学革命师生代表的队伍，送来四个玉米面饽饽：“你们路上吃。小伙子们，要永远跟着毛主席啊！”同学们要他写几个字留纪念，他写下了十六个字：“希望你们将来把本领用到工农兵中去！”
    同学们肩负天津全体革命师生的重托，带着工人阶级殷切的期望，心里热呼呼的，快步向北京、向毛主席身边走来了。
    走到杨村，一个激动人心的消息传来：毛主席派火车来接他们了！“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席！毛主席！”口号声响彻杨村的上空，很多人一边跳一边笑一边流着热泪。
    在北京，各校的革命师生员工，热情地接待了外地来的战友。
    八月十七日，一个更激动人心的消息传来：十八日到天安门广场开庆祝文化大革命的大会。当晚，分散在北京各校的有些革命师生开了誓师大会。“明天，我们要到什么地方，可能见到什么人啊！”把毛主席像举起来，把“毛主席万岁”的标语牌写得大大的、工工整整的。革命师生们迫不及待，当晚就敲锣打鼓走向天安门。
    十八日早晨，东方红，太阳升，我们心中最红最红的太阳——毛主席出现在天安门城楼上。“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”口号声响彻广场，响彻北京，响彻全中国，响彻全世界。
      “我为什么见到毛主席反而会哭？我父亲是贫农，解放前受尽了地主的压迫。是党和毛主席解放了我们。爸爸常常对我说：毛主席是我们的救星。多少年来，我多么渴望见到毛主席啊！愿望终于实现了，我到了毛主席的身边。高兴、激动，使我流泪。这是我一生中最最幸福的一天。我一定要永远永远听毛主席的话，记住十八日林彪同志、周恩来同志对我们的期望和鼓舞，当好无产阶级革命事业接班人！”这是新港中学一位女学生事后对记者说的。
    毛主席在一九五八年八月十三日，到天津大学视察过。这是天津大学最光荣最值得纪念的一天。现在，天津大学革命学生就用“八·一三”来命名自己的“红卫兵”。八月十八日，“八·一三红卫兵”也和毛主席在一起。他们有一首诗敬献给伟大的领袖和导师，其中有一段写道：
    我们红卫兵战士，
    只有一个信念——
    保卫党中央！
    保卫毛主席！
    我们红卫兵战士，
    只有一个决心——
    一定要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    为了崇高的共产主义事业，
    永远革命、永远战斗、永远跟着毛主席！
