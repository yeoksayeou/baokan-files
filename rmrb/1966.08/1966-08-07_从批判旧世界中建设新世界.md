Without criticizing the old, we cannot create the new; without criticizing the bourgeoisie, we cannot build socialism. We resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, becoming critics of the old world and builders and defenders of the new world.

Shi Yudian, an agricultural labor model from Henan Province

Chairman Mao's great instructions have greatly inspired me. Especially the instructions about criticizing the bourgeoisie, I feel particularly close to them, because I have personal experience.

In 1951, when I attended a forestry conference in the province, I heard that our country's industrial construction and the people's production and life all needed tung oil. I thought about planting tung trees in my hometown. However, when I mentioned this idea, some bourgeois forestry "authorities" shook their heads and said, "Southern trees will not grow in the north. This is an old conclusion, don't think about it." Can we peasants really not do it? Later, I studied Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said, "Among all things in the world, people are the most precious. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle can be created." I pondered Chairman Mao's words and thought they made a lot of sense. Everything is done by people. In the old society, we poor people were like cattle and horses. The Communist Party liberated the poor, and the poor people became masters. In the old society, farming was "planted in the ground, harvested by the heavens"; now, with the party's leadership and the collective path, isn't it "planted in the ground, harvested by people," and people can conquer nature? Can't tung trees from the south take root in our Lin County? I didn't believe the bourgeois "authorities" and bought five pounds of tung seeds to plant. The tung seeds sprouted and grew over three feet tall that year. Now, several brigades in our county have tung forests, and some have already started bearing fruit.

In 1956, I went with the county committee's responsible comrades to investigate the deep mountains and found that the mountains were full of wild walnut trees. I said, it would be great to graft these wild walnut trees into domestic walnut trees. Those bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" sneered and asked me, "Old Shi, which school did you graduate from?" I said, "I graduated from herding cows." They laughed loudly and said, "No wonder, you don't understand. The question you raised, not only can we not solve it, but even foreign literature doesn't have the answer." Later, I heard someone say: things that foreigners have not done, we should be the first to do; things not in the books, we should write them. I was inspired and decided to use facts to refute them. I thought, I don't have your foreign tricks, but I have Mao Zedong Thought, and I must make an example to show them. I insisted on experimenting with grafting wild walnuts onto domestic walnuts, and after two or three years, I finally succeeded and promoted it throughout the county.

In 1960, the Central Forestry Department held a forestry conference in Lin County. At the meeting, I introduced the experience of grafting wild walnuts onto domestic walnuts. As soon as I finished speaking, those so-called "experts" and "authorities" still doubted and asked, "Are you talking about a plan, or did you really graft it?" I replied, "Of course, it was grafted." They shook their heads and said, "It can't be, there's no such thing in the world." I said, "If you don't believe it, you can go and see." They said, "There's no point in looking, even if it's grafted, it won't bear fruit." I said, "Not only will it bear fruit, but it will bear a lot." They sneered and said, "Impossible, impossible." I thought, if I don't bring the actual product, you won't admit defeat. When they saw a basket of walnuts picked from the successfully grafted walnut trees in Guo Family Garden Brigade, they stopped talking nonsense.

Various old thoughts, old cultures, old customs, and old habits of the bourgeoisie still exist in large quantities in various aspects of our work and life. Without criticizing the old, we cannot create the new; without criticizing the bourgeoisie, we cannot build socialism. We resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, becoming critics of the old world and builders and defenders of the new world.

    从批判旧世界中建设新世界
    不批判旧的，就不能创造新的；不批判资产阶级，就不能建设社会主义。我们坚决听毛主席的话，做旧世界的批判者，做新世界的建设者和保卫者。

    毛主席的伟大指示，使我感到极大的鼓舞。尤其是关于要批判资产阶级的指示，我感到特别亲切，因为我是有亲身体会的。
    一九五一年我在省里参加林业会议时，听说我们国家工业建设和群众生产、生活都需要桐油，就想在我们家乡栽种油桐。谁知我把这个打算一说，有些资产阶级的林业“权威”，就摇头说：“南方树种到北方不会生长，这是老结论，你别瞎想了。”我们庄稼人真的不行吗？后来我学习了毛主席著作。毛主席说：“世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。”我揣摩着毛主席的话，越想越有理，一切事都是人干出来的。在旧社会，我们穷人当牛做马，共产党解放了穷人，穷人不就从牛马变成主人了吗？旧社会种庄稼，是“种在地，收在天”；现在有了党的领导，走了集体化道路，不就是种在地，收在人，人定胜天了吗？南方的油桐就不能在我们林县落户吗？我就不相信资产阶级“权威”那一套，买了五斤油桐籽种上。油桐籽出土以后，当年就长了三尺多高。现在，我们全县好几个大队有了油桐林，有的已开始结果。
    一九五六年，我跟县委负责同志到深山区调查时，发现满山长着山核桃树。我说，把山核桃树改接成家核桃树多好啊。那些资产阶级的“专家”“权威”却冷笑着问我：“老石，你是什么学校毕业？”我说：“我是放牛毕业。”他们哈哈大笑几声，说：“这就难怪你了，你不懂嘛，你提的这个问题，不仅我们解决不了，就是外国文献里也找不到答案。”后来我听别人说：外国没有做过的事情，我们要给它开个头，书本上没有的，我们要给它写上去。我受了启发，就下定决心用事实来回击他们。我想，我没有你们那套洋玩艺，可是我有毛泽东思想，一定要做出个样子来叫你们看看。我就坚持进行山核桃嫁接家核桃的试验，经过两三年，终于嫁接成功，并在全县推广了。
    一九六○年中央林业部在林县召开林业会。会上我介绍了把山核桃嫁接成家核桃的经验。我讲话刚完，那些所谓“专家”“权威”，仍然怀疑地问：“你说的是计划，还是真的嫁接成了？”我回答说：“当然是嫁接成了。”他们又摇头说：“不会吧，世界上还没有这样的事。”我说：“你们不信，可以去看看。”他们又说：“看也没啥意思，即便接活了，也不会结果子。”我说：“不仅会结果子，而且结得很多。”他们冷笑着说：“不可能，不可能。”我想，不拿来实物，你们不会认输。当他们看到从郭家园大队嫁接成功的核桃树上摘来的一篮核桃时，才不发谬论了。
    资产阶级各种各样的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，在我们工作和生活的各个方面还大量存在着。不批判旧的，就不能创造新的；不批判资产阶级，就不能建设社会主义。我们坚决听毛主席的话，做旧世界的批判者，做新世界的建设者和保卫者。
