Chairman Mao's statement issued three years ago has marked significant developments in the struggle of American blacks. American blacks are awakening, and their resistance is becoming increasingly fierce, surging forward with an irresistible momentum towards self-defense through violence. They are linking their struggle with the global people's anti-American struggle, firmly opposing U.S. imperialist aggression policies.

New China News Agency, August 7th: Our correspondent reports that the three years since Chairman Mao Zedong issued his important statement supporting the struggle of American blacks in August 1963 have been years of rapid escalation and significant development in the struggle of American blacks. It has been a period where their slogans have become increasingly clear, their resolve has grown stronger, and their methods have become more intense. This vividly proves Chairman Mao's insightful judgment three years ago: "American blacks are awakening, and their resistance is becoming increasingly fierce. In recent years, the mass struggle of American blacks against racial discrimination and for freedom and equal rights has shown a trend of continuous development."

Over the past three years, the struggle of American blacks has surged forward like a tidal wave, from the agricultural regions of the South to the industrial regions of the North, from the East Coast to the West Coast, wave after wave. A few years ago, the methods of black struggle were mainly sit-ins, strikes, and peaceful marches. In the past two to three years, the tide of black struggle has breached the dam of "non-violence," swiftly moving towards self-defense against the violent suppression of the reactionary ruling class.

In July 1964, the violent self-defense struggle of blacks in the Harlem district of New York City marked the beginning of large-scale violent self-defense struggles in the urban slums. At that time, thousands of blacks took to the streets in anger to protest the police's unjustified killing of a black child, fighting against tens of thousands of armed police for six days and nights. Inspired by the heroic struggle of blacks in Harlem, blacks in many cities quickly launched violent self-defense struggles of varying scales. In August 1965, 7,000 blacks in the Watts district of Los Angeles bravely fought against nearly 20,000 armed military police for nearly ten days and nights. Some of the crowd seized weapons and retaliated against the attacking police, pushing the black violent self-defense struggle to a new height.

Since the beginning of this summer, violent self-defense struggles by blacks have been frequent and unending in various places. In a series of important industrial cities in the South and North, such as Chicago, Cleveland, San Francisco, Jacksonville, New York, and Omaha, large-scale violent self-defense struggles by blacks have broken out and lasted for many days. American bourgeois newspapers, trembling with fear, compared the fierce battles in the streets and alleys of black districts in cities like Chicago and Cleveland to "guerrilla warfare."

Through their struggles, American blacks have, for the first time, felt their own strength. A new generation of leaders with a fighting spirit is rapidly emerging from the struggle; many regions of blacks are organizing themselves in the struggle. In the five states where racism is particularly rampant in the South, a newly established black armed self-defense organization has set up dozens of branch organizations; in many industrial centers in the North, many open or secret armed self-defense organizations have also been formed.

Over the past few years, black masses have raised increasingly loud slogans in their struggles. A few years ago, the main slogans of the black struggle were to fight for certain aspects of racial equality and basic human rights. In 1965, they further raised the slogan "Freedom Now!" This year, the clear battle cry "Black Power!" has emerged. Currently, this slogan is resonating throughout the South and North, inspiring the fighting spirit of blacks.

The significant development of the black struggle in the past three years is the inevitable result of the reactionary domestic and foreign policies pursued by the American ruling class, a clear manifestation of the sharpening of national and class contradictions within the United States. Chairman Mao pointed out in his statement three years ago: "Ultimately, national struggle is a class struggle issue." The American ruling class, in order to carry out external aggression and expansion, has ruthlessly exploited the American working people and implemented fascist rule. The victims of these policies are primarily the black working masses at the bottom of American society. In recent years, the living conditions of black working masses have continued to deteriorate. In the years when the American economy was supposedly "unprecedentedly prosperous," the unemployment rate among blacks has been increasing rather than decreasing, more than double the unemployment rate of the entire American workforce. In the South, due to the intensification of mechanization by white plantation owners, tens of thousands of black agricultural workers and tenant farmers fall into the plight of homelessness and starvation every year. In the northern cities, the horrifying poverty and increasingly severe unemployment are tormenting millions of black residents in the slums. They are not only exploited layer by layer by white capitalists, merchants, loan sharks, and landlords, but are also often the targets of arbitrary police harassment. It is precisely because of this that the black working masses are increasingly becoming a crucial force in the struggle. They have injected new vitality and a vigorous fighting spirit into the entire struggle, giving it a completely new look compared to previous years.

While intensifying the Vietnam War, the Johnson administration has increasingly tightened fascist suppression of the black struggle to maintain a stable rear. Chairman Mao pointed out: "The fascist atrocities of American imperialism against blacks have exposed the essence of American democracy and freedom, revealing the internal connection between the reactionary policies of the American government at home and its aggression policies abroad."

It is precisely based on this understanding that more and more blacks are linking their self-defense struggles with the anti-American struggles of the Vietnamese people and the people of other countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, clearly directing their struggle against the aggressive policies of the American government. This is another important feature distinguishing the current black struggle from that of three years ago. Tens of thousands of black masses have joined anti-Vietnam War protests in various places. They shout slogans such as "Down with American imperialism!" and "Blacks, awake, stop the Vietnam War!" More and more black youths openly refuse to be cannon fodder for the ruling class in the invasion of Vietnam, clearly stating: "We must stay here (in America) to fight for freedom!" The struggle of the black masses, together with the struggle of the American masses against the invasion of Vietnam, has become a massive wave, striking the Johnson administration.

The rapid development of the black struggle in the past three years marks the failure of the Johnson administration's policy of deception and suppression. During this period, the Johnson administration has successively proposed three fraudulent "civil rights laws," attempting to numb and disintegrate the black fighting spirit; at the same time, it frequently deploys thousands of police and military to carry out bloody suppression of the black struggle. The American ruling class has thus continuously educated the black masses from the opposite side, making them increasingly aware of its hypocritical and brutal nature, promoting their awakening.

The new awakening of American blacks and the storm of struggle they have unleashed have made the ruling class extremely anxious and uneasy. Recently, the U.S. president and vice president have successively made speeches, shouting that "violent behavior cannot be tolerated or forgiven," which is a sign of the American ruling class's fear of the black violent self-defense struggle and its preparation for further brutal suppression of the black struggle. However, as Chairman Mao pointed out, the various persecutions inflicted by the reactionaries on the revolutionary people ultimately only promote broader and more intense revolutionary struggles by the people; "with the support of more than 90% of the people worldwide, the just struggle of American blacks is bound to be victorious. The evil system of colonialism and imperialism, which rose with the enslavement and trafficking of blacks, will also come to an end with the complete liberation of the black race."

### 毛主席发表声明三年来美国黑人斗争大发展

    毛主席发表声明三年来美国黑人斗争大发展
    美国黑人正在觉醒，反抗日益强烈，并以排山倒海之势迅猛地走上暴力自卫道路。他们把自己的斗争同世界人民反美斗争密切联系起来，坚决反对美帝侵略政策
    新华社七日讯　本社记者报道：毛泽东主席一九六三年八月八日发表支持美国黑人斗争的重要声明以来的三年，是美国黑人斗争急剧高涨和大发展的三年；是他们的斗争口号越来越鲜明、斗争意志越来越坚强、斗争手段越来越激烈的三年。这就十分生动地证明了毛泽东主席三年前提出的英明论断：“美国黑人正在觉醒，他们的反抗日益强烈。近几年来，美国黑人反对种族歧视、争取自由和平等权利的群众性斗争，有日益发展的趋势。”
    三年来，美国黑人的斗争，以排山倒海之势，从南部的农业地区到北部的工业地区，从东海岸到西海岸，一浪高过一浪地滚滚向前推进。前几年，黑人的斗争主要还是采取静坐、罢课、和平进军等方式。近两三年来，黑人斗争的怒潮正在冲垮“非暴力主义”的堤坎，迅猛地走上以暴力自卫反抗反动统治集团的暴力镇压的道路。
    一九六四年七月，纽约市哈莱姆区黑人进行的暴力自卫斗争揭开了大城市贫民窟黑人群众大规模暴力自卫斗争的序幕。当时，数千黑人为了抗议警察无端杀害黑人儿童的暴行，愤怒地涌上街头，同数千名武装警察搏斗了六昼夜。在哈莱姆区黑人英勇斗争的鼓舞下，许多城市的黑人紧接着开展了不同规模的暴力自卫斗争。一九六五年八月，洛杉矶市瓦茨区七千黑人不畏强暴，不怕牺牲，同近两万名武装军警搏斗近十昼夜，部分群众夺取了枪枝向行凶警察进行还击，从而把黑人的暴力自卫斗争推上了新的高峰。
    今年入夏以来，各地黑人暴力自卫斗争更是此伏彼起、连绵不断。在芝加哥、克利夫兰、旧金山、杰克逊维尔、纽约、奥马哈等一系列南北重要工业城市中，都先后爆发了持续多日、规模可观的黑人暴力自卫斗争。美国资产阶级报刊心惊胆战地把芝加哥、克利夫兰等城市中黑人区各条大街小巷中发生的激烈战斗同“游击战”的情景相比拟。
    美国黑人通过斗争，前所未有地感到了自己的力量，一代新的富有战斗精神的领导人正在斗争中迅速成长起来；许多地区的黑人正在斗争中组织起来。在种族主义特别猖獗的南部五个州里，去年新成立的一个黑人武装自卫团体已经建立起五、六十个分支组织；在北部许多工业中心，也组成了许多公开的或秘密的武装自卫团体。
    黑人群众几年来在斗争中提出了越来越响亮的斗争口号。前几年，黑人斗争的主要口号，还是争取某些方面的种族平等和基本人权，在一九六五年，他们进而提出了“现在就自由！”的口号。今年以来，又出现了“黑人要权力！”这一鲜明的战斗口号。目前，这个口号正响彻美国南北各地，鼓舞着黑人的斗志。
    三年来，美国黑人斗争的大发展，是美国统治集团执行的内外反动政策的必然结果，是美国国内民族矛盾和阶级矛盾尖锐化的明显表现。毛泽东主席在三年前的声明里说：“民族斗争，说到底，是一个阶级斗争问题。”美国统治集团为了对外侵略扩张，对美国广大劳动人民进行残酷的压榨和实行法西斯统治。这些政策的受害者，首先是处在美国社会最底层的黑人劳动群众。近年来，美国黑人劳动群众的生活条件不断恶化。在号称美国经济“空前繁荣”的这几年，黑人的失业比率有增无减，比美国全部劳动力的失业比率要高出一倍多。在南部，由于白人大庄园主加紧实行耕作机械化，每年都有数以万计的黑人农业工人和佃农陷入颠沛流离、衣食无着的绝境。在北部大城市，骇人听闻的贫困和日益严重的失业折磨着贫民窟里数以百万计的黑人居民。他们不仅受到白人资本家、商人、高利贷者、房东等的层层盘剥，而且还经常是警察任意欺凌的对象。正是因为这样，黑人劳动群众正日益成为斗争中举足轻重的力量。他们给整个斗争注入了新的生命力和昂扬的战斗精神，使它具有了不同于前几年的崭新面貌。
    约翰逊政府在加紧进行侵越战争的同时，为了在国内维持一个安定的后方，越来越加紧对黑人斗争进行法西斯镇压。毛主席指出：“美国帝国主义对黑人的法西斯暴行，揭穿了美国的所谓民主和自由的本质，暴露了美国政府在国内的反动政策和在国外的侵略政策之间的内在联系。”
    正是基于这样的认识，越来越多的黑人开始把自己的暴力自卫斗争同越南人民和亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲其他各国人民的反美斗争密切联系起来，把斗争的矛头明确指向美国政府的侵略政策。这是当前黑人斗争区别于三年前的又一个重要特点。成千上万的黑人群众投入了各地反对侵越战争的抗议活动。他们在斗争中高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”“黑人们觉醒起来，制止越南战争！”等口号。越来越多的黑人青年公开拒绝替统治集团充当侵略越南的炮灰，他们明确表示：“我们必须留在这里（美国），为自由而战！”黑人群众的这一斗争，同美国广大群众反对侵略越南的斗争汇合在一起，成为一个巨大的浪潮，冲击着约翰逊政府。
    三年来黑人斗争的急剧发展标志着约翰逊政府欺骗和镇压的反革命两手政策的破产。在这期间，约翰逊政府先后提出了三个虚伪的“民权法”，妄图麻痹和瓦解黑人斗志；同时，经常出动成千名军警，对黑人斗争进行血腥的镇压。美国统治集团就这样不断从反面教育了黑人群众，使他们越来越清楚地识破了它的伪善、残暴的面目，促进了他们的觉醒。
    美国黑人的新觉醒和他们掀起的一场比一场激烈的斗争风暴，使统治集团惊慌万状，如坐针毡。最近美国正副总统接连发表谈话，叫嚷“不能容忍和宽恕”暴力行为，这是美国统治集团对黑人暴力自卫斗争感到胆战心惊的表现，也是它准备进一步残酷镇压黑人斗争的讯号。但是，正如毛主席所指出的，反动派对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更激烈的革命；“在全世界百分之九十以上的人民的支持下，美国黑人的正义斗争是一定要胜利的。万恶的殖民主义、帝国主义制度是随着奴役和贩卖黑人而兴盛起来的，它也必将随着黑色人种的彻底解放而告终”。
