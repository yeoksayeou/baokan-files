All reactionaries throughout history, both at home and abroad, claim that exploitation is justified, oppression is justified, aggression is justified, and the rule of revisionism is justified, while the proletariat's rebellion is unjustified. It is our most beloved leader and greatest revolutionary teacher, Chairman Mao, who has overturned this nonsense. Chairman Mao says: "The thousand and ten thousand principles of Marxism can all be summed up in one sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.'" Today's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great rebellion. Whoever is a revisionist and opposes Mao Zedong Thought, we will rebel against them!

We, the Red Guards who are most loyal to Chairman Mao, will definitely be the most resolute, the bravest, and the most loyal in executing the highest directive of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution—Chairman Mao's directive on rebellion.

What attitude one takes towards revolutionary rebellion is the dividing line between those who are loyal to the highest directive and those who oppose it, and the dividing line between revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries.

Are you a revolutionary? Then you must welcome revolutionary rebellion, support revolutionary rebellion, participate in revolutionary rebellion, and rebel to the end!

Are you a counter-revolutionary? Then, out of class instinct, you must curse rebellion, oppose rebellion, resist rebellion, and suppress rebellion.

The revolutionary left of the proletariat lives on revolutionary rebellion! The bourgeois revisionists are constantly rebelling against us. If you don't rebel against them, they will rebel against you. Straddling the fence and compromising is not an option! Against the black gang, against the old world, against old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits, and against everything that opposes Mao Zedong Thought, we must stage a great rebellion!

Those who tremble with fear, frown, fly into a rage, curse, and have hysterical fits at the mere mention of revolutionary rebellion are either counter-revolutionaries or fools! These bastards think they can rebel against the proletariat, but we won't rebel against them. They think they can set fires, but we can't even light a lamp. This is utterly outrageous and intolerable!

Rebellion is the tradition of our proletarian revolutionaries, a tradition that the Red Guards must inherit and carry forward. We rebelled in the past, we rebel now, and we will rebel in the future! As long as classes and class struggle exist, we will rebel! As long as there are contradictions, we will rebel! The spirit of revolutionary rebellion is needed for a hundred years, a thousand years, ten thousand years, and a hundred million years!

The current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great storm of the revolutionary rebel spirit of the proletariat. Comrades in arms of the Red Guards, all revolutionary comrades, let us soar like brave seagulls in this great storm!

Comrades in arms of the Red Guards, since we have already started the rebellion, let us rebel to the end! Charge forward, let the revolutionary storm be even more fierce!

Long live the revolutionary rebel spirit of the proletariat! Ten thousand years live the revolutionary rebel spirit of the proletariat!

    三论无产阶级的革命造反精神万岁
    古今中外的一切反动派说：剥削有理，压迫有理，侵略有理，修正主义统治有理，无产阶级造反无理。是我们最敬爱的领袖、最伟大的革命导师毛主席，把这个混蛋理论颠倒过来了。毛主席说：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’”今天的无产阶级文化大革命就是一次革命的大造反。谁个是修正主义，谁个反毛泽东思想，我们就大造其反！
    我们，毛主席最最忠实的红卫兵，无限忠于毛主席，一定最坚决，一定最勇敢，最忠实地执行无产阶级文化大革命的最高指示——毛主席的关于造反的最高指示。
    对待革命的造反行动采取什么态度，是鉴别忠实于最高指示还是反对最高指示的分水岭，是鉴别革命和反革命的分水岭。
    你是革命者么？你就必然欢迎革命的造反，拥护革命的造反，参加革命的造反，一反到底！
    你是反革命么？那就出于阶级的本能，就必然咒骂造反，反对造反，抵制造反，镇压造反。
    无产阶级革命的左派，就是靠革命的造反吃饭的！资产阶级修正主义天天在造我们的反，你不造他的反，他就造你的反，骑墙、搞折衷是不行的！对黑帮，对旧世界，对旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，对一切反毛泽东思想的东西，就得来一场革命的大造反！
    一听革命的造反就心惊肉跳，就皱眉头，就暴跳如雷，就骂街，就歇斯底里大发作的先生们，不是反革命就是糊涂虫！这些混蛋们，只准他们造无产阶级的反，不准我们无产阶级造他们的反。只许州官放火，不许百姓点灯，真是岂有此理，欺人太甚！
    造反，是我们无产阶级革命者的传统，是红卫兵要继承和发扬的传统。我们过去造反，现在造反，将来还要造反！只要阶级和阶级斗争存在，就要造反！只要有矛盾存在，就要造反！革命的造反精神，一百年需要，一千年需要，一万年一亿年还需要！
    目前的无产阶级文化大革命，就是一场无产阶级革命的造反精神激荡的大风暴。红卫兵的战士们，一切革命的同志们，让我们像勇敢的海燕一样在这场大风暴中翱翔吧！
    红卫兵的战士们，我们既然已经把反造起来了，那么就一反到底吧！迎上前去，让革命的大风暴来得更猛烈些吧！
    无产阶级的革命造反精神万岁！万万岁！
