Vietnamese Foreign Ministry and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam's External Liaison Committee Issue Statements

Resolutely Oppose U.S. Imperialism’s Use of Puppets to Plot Peace Talks

Condemn U.S. Imperialism’s Planned “Asian Nations Conference” to Create a Peace Talks Hoax

	New China News Agency, Hanoi, August 23 — The spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on August 22, strongly condemning U.S. imperialism’s use of its “Southeast Asia Treaty Organization” (SEATO) puppets to push for “peace talks” plots.

	The statement said, it is well known that SEATO is a tool serving U.S. imperialism’s policy of aggression in this region. The three member countries within this organization are the most reliable running dogs of U.S. imperialism and British imperialism in opposing the independence and peace of the peoples of Indochina and Southeast Asia.

	The statement pointed out that on the issue of Vietnam, the member countries of SEATO fully support and serve U.S. imperialism’s policy of aggression. The Thai government has allowed U.S. aircraft to use Thai airfields as bases for bombing and strafing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. It has also dispatched pilots, other military personnel, and aircraft and warships to participate in U.S. aggression in South Vietnam. The Philippines is an important strategic base for the U.S. air force, navy, and logistics in Vietnam. Recently, the Philippine government decided to dispatch 2,000 troops to South Vietnam to assist the U.S. in its aggression. “Malaysia” has long been the center for training officers and police to suppress the people of South Vietnam for the Saigon puppet regime, and is currently becoming an important logistics base for U.S. imperialist invaders.

	The statement said, U.S. imperialism’s use of the notorious running dogs within SEATO to realize its “peace talks” plot proves its extreme political isolation.

	The statement said, the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly condemns all the cunning “peace talks” plots played by the U.S. on the issue of Vietnam, and resolutely opposes the suggestion by SEATO to convene a so-called “Asian Nations Conference” to “seek peaceful solutions to the Vietnam War.”

	The statement finally said, the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam solemnly reaffirms that only the four-point proposal published by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on April 8, 1965, is the correct basis for solving the Vietnam issue.

	New China News Agency, Hanoi, August 22 — The spokesperson for the External Liaison Committee of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam issued a statement on August 19, strongly condemning the plots of U.S. imperialism’s running dogs, Thailand, “Malaysia,” and the Philippines, to convene a so-called “Asian Nations Conference” for the peaceful resolution of the Vietnam issue.

	The statement pointed out that the so-called “Asian Nations Conference” to discuss the Vietnam issue is essentially a Johnson-Rusk-style “peace” hoax serving to strengthen and expand U.S. imperialism’s aggression in Vietnam. They shout “Asians solving Asian problems,” but in reality, they are serving U.S. imperialism’s plot of “using Asians to fight Asians.”

	The statement said, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam sternly warns U.S. imperialism and its running dogs that their plots to expand the war in South Vietnam, and all their deceptive “peace” measures to cover up this plot, will not save U.S. imperialism from suffering a thorough defeat in South Vietnam.

	The statement said, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam reaffirms that the people of South Vietnam are determined to strengthen their anti-U.S. war of national liberation until they achieve final victory, until there is not a single U.S. aggressor left on their land.

    越南外交部和南越民族解放阵线对外联络委员会分别声明
    坚决反对美帝利用走狗搞和谈阴谋
    谴责美帝策划“亚洲国家会议”制造和谈骗局
    新华社河内二十三日电　越南民主共和国外交部发言人二十二日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义利用它的“东南亚联盟”的走狗推行“和平谈判”的阴谋。
    声明说，众所周知，“东南亚联盟”是为美帝国主义在这个地区的侵略政策效劳的工具。这个联盟中的三个会员国，都是美帝国主义和英帝国主义反对印度支那和东南亚各国人民的独立与和平的最得力的走狗。
    声明指出，在越南问题上，“东南亚联盟”的会员国完全支持美帝国主义的侵略政策，并为之效劳。泰国政府已经让美国飞机使用泰国的各个机场作为轰炸扫射越南民主共和国的基地。它还派遣飞行员、其他军事人员和飞机、军舰等参加美国在越南南方进行的侵略行动。菲律宾是在越南的美国侵略军的一个空军、海军和后勤的重要战略基地。最近，菲律宾政府还决定派遣两千名军队到越南南方帮助美国进行侵略。“马来西亚”很久以来就是为西贡伪政权训练镇压越南南方人民的军官和警察的中心，而目前正在变成美帝国主义侵略者的一个重要后勤基地。
    声明说，美帝国主义利用“东南亚联盟”中臭名远扬的走狗来实现“和平谈判”的阴谋，证明它在政治上的极端孤立。
    声明说，越南民主共和国外交部强烈谴责美国在越南问题上所玩弄的一切狡猾的“和平谈判”阴谋，并且坚决反对“东南亚联盟”提出的召开所谓“亚洲国家会议”以“寻求和平解决越南战争办法”的建议。
    声明最后说，越南民主共和国外交部郑重重申，只有越南民主共和国政府一九六五年四月八日公布的四项主张，才是解决越南问题的正确基础。
    新华社河内二十二日电　越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会对外联络委员会发言人十九日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义的走狗泰国、“马来西亚”和菲律宾阴谋召集所谓和平解决越南问题的“亚洲国家会议”。
    声明指出，所谓讨论越南问题的“亚洲国家会议”的实质，不过是一个为美帝国主义加强和扩大侵越战争效劳的约翰逊—腊斯克式的“和平”骗局。它们叫嚷“亚洲人解决亚洲问题”，但实际上是在为美帝国主义“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的阴谋效劳。
    声明说，越南南方民族解放阵线严厉警告美帝国主义及其走狗，它们对越南南方的一切扩大战争的阴谋，和它们为掩盖这一阴谋而采取的各种骗人的“和平”手段，都绝不能挽救美帝国主义在越南南方遭到彻底失败。
    声明说，越南南方民族解放阵线重申，越南南方人民决心加强自己的抗美救国战争，直到最后取得胜利，直到在自己的国土上没有一个美国侵略者为止。
