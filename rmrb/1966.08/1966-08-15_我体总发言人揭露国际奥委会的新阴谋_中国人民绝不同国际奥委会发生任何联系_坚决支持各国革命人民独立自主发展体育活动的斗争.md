The spokesperson of the All-China Sports Federation today issued a statement exposing a new conspiracy by the International Olympic Committee and reaffirmed: "The Chinese people and athletes will absolutely not have any contact with the International Olympic Committee, which serves as a political tool for U.S. imperialism. The Chinese people and athletes will absolutely not abandon the just struggle of the peoples and athletes of all countries against imperialist monopolization and control of international sports. This is our unshakable position."

The spokesperson said that in recent times, some Western news agencies have been spreading rumors that "China hopes to participate in the 1968 Olympic Games." The pseudo-Ministry of Foreign Affairs of South Korea even went so far as to "instruct" its embassy in Mexico to "prevent Communist China from possibly participating in the next Olympic Games." Following this, the spokesperson of the International Olympic Committee immediately commented on this news, stating that "if China wishes to participate in the 1968 Olympics, it can apply to join the International Olympic Committee at any time." To confuse the issue, the International Olympic Committee also maliciously claimed that some countries' sports leaders' desire to visit China was for the purpose of "mediating between China and the International Olympic Committee." Some reactionary international sports organizations have also expressed their "welcome" for China to "return."

The spokesperson pointed out that all of this is a grand conspiracy orchestrated by Avery Brundage, the American chairman of the International Olympic Committee. It is well known that the International Olympic Committee has always actively served U.S. imperialism's conspiracy to create "two Chinas" in international sports activities. It has always collaborated with the U.S. ruling class's policy of "containment and isolation" against New China, sparing no effort to prohibit and obstruct sports exchanges between China and various countries around the world. Now, when U.S. imperialism, in order to cover up the failure of its policy to "isolate" China, is playing a new trick of so-called "containment without isolation," Brundage quickly follows suit in the International Olympic Committee, throwing out a new conspiracy of supposedly "opening the door" to China. This once again proves that the International Olympic Committee, under Brundage's manipulation, is completely a political tool of U.S. imperialism.

The spokesperson said: It must be pointed out that the purpose of Brundage and his ilk in playing this new trick is simply to attempt to raise doubts about China's firmness in opposing imperialism led by the United States, to sabotage the anti-imperialist unity between the Chinese people and athletes and the peoples of the world, to weaken the burgeoning New Emerging Forces Games, and to divert attention, covering up the failure of their reactionary policies hostile to the peoples of Asia and Africa and the Chinese people.

The spokesperson finally pointed out that the changes in the reactionary methods of the International Olympic Committee and other reactionary international sports organizations indicate their weakness and failure, indicating that their days are numbered. The Chinese people and athletes will stand more firmly with the peoples and athletes of all countries, resolutely supporting the struggle of the revolutionary peoples of all countries to independently and autonomously develop sports activities; resolutely opposing the use of sports by imperialism led by the United States and old and new colonialism for its reactionary politics; and resolutely contributing all our strength to the consolidation and development of the New Emerging Forces Games.

　　我体总发言人揭露国际奥委会的新阴谋
　　中国人民绝不同国际奥委会发生任何联系
　　坚决支持各国革命人民独立自主发展体育活动的斗争
    新华社十四日讯　中华全国体育总会发言人今天发表谈话，揭露国际奥林匹克委员会的新阴谋，并且重申：“中国人民和运动员绝不同充当美帝国主义政治工具的国际奥委会发生任何联系。中国人民和运动员绝不放弃支持各国人民和运动员反对帝国主义垄断和控制国际体育的正义斗争。这是我们坚定不移的立场。”
    这位发言人说，近一个时期以来，一些西方通讯社不断散布“中国希望参加一九六八年奥林匹克运动会”的谣言。南朝鲜伪外务省更是煞有介事地“指示”其驻墨西哥大使馆“阻止共产党中国可能参加下届奥林匹克运动会”。接着国际奥林匹克委员会发言人立即对这条消息发表评论，表示“如果中国希望参加一九六八年奥运会的话，它可以随意申请参加国际奥委会”。为了混淆视听，国际奥委会还把有些国家的体育领导人想来我国访问一事，别有用心地说成是为了在我国“和国际奥委会之间进行调停”。一些反动的国际体育组织也相继表示“欢迎”中国“重新回去”。
    发言人指出，所有这一切，都是国际奥委会美籍主席布伦戴奇一手策划的一个大阴谋。众所周知，国际奥委会在国际体育活动中，一贯为美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋积极效劳，一贯配合美国统治集团对新中国“遏制加孤立”的政策，不遗余力地禁止和阻挠世界各国同中国进行体育来往。现在，当美帝国主义为了掩盖它的“孤立”中国政策的失败，玩弄所谓“遏制而不予孤立”的新阴谋的时候，布伦戴奇赶紧在国际奥委会中如法炮制，抛出一个所谓对中国“敞开大门”的新阴谋。这就再一次证明了在布伦戴奇操纵下的国际奥委会完完全全是美帝国主义的一个政治工具。
    发言人说：必须指出，布伦戴奇之流玩弄这个新阴谋的目的，无非是企图引起人们对中国反对以美国为首的帝国主义的坚定性的怀疑，破坏中国人民和运动员同世界各国人民的反帝团结，削弱日益发展壮大的新兴力量运动会事业，并以此转移视线，掩盖他们敌视亚非人民和中国人民的反动政策的失败。
    发言人最后指出，国际奥委会等反动国际体育组织这种反动手法上的变化，说明了它们的虚弱和失败，说明它们的日子越来越不好过了。中国人民和运动员将更加坚定地和世界各国人民和运动员在一起，坚决支持各国革命人民要求独立自主发展体育活动的斗争；坚决反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义利用体育为它的反动政治服务；坚决为新运会事业的巩固和发展而贡献出自己的全部力量。
