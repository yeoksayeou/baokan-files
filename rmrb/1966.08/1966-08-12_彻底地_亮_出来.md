A person's ideological transformation cannot be separated from the masses. Therefore, the self-awareness of ideological transformation also lies in whether one can rely on the masses and dare to rely on the masses.

For a period of time, I was often praised. I thought: I have health issues and my abilities are limited. The more praise I receive, the greater the pressure. Later, I read some articles in the newspaper about how to deal with pressure. After comparing, I realized that my thoughts had again grown "moss." I was afraid that if the leaders praised me too much, the masses would all be watching me, and even a small problem would attract attention. Therefore, not wanting to be praised by superiors is not humility, but fear of being supervised by the masses. I realized that this was the beginning of a decline in revolutionary spirit and the rise of selfish thoughts. Although it was just a sign, it could not be taken lightly.

So, how do you change this deep-seated problem? Should it be changed quietly or "exposed"? Chairman Mao said: "A Communist Party member should be open-hearted, honest, and active, putting revolutionary interests first and personal interests second." Having the thought of fearing mass supervision and being hesitant is even more reason to seek supervision from the masses. This is truly open-hearted. Thus, I exposed this problem to my leaders and comrades. Once exposed, it quickly reached the ears of the leaders. The political commissar talked to me and said: "Fear of mass supervision is the beginning of detachment from the masses; a person who sets aside the 'I' will feel that they cannot be without the Party and the masses for a moment." Later, I heard another comrade say: "I didn't know that Yang Daogen had this problem before, but now I will keep an eye on him and help him." Hearing this, I felt warm in my heart. Because this comrade never gave me any advice before, but now he is also concerned about me. Later, the comrades also helped me analyze: if the pressure comes from the "I," this pressure is a corrosive agent, pressing people to be shortsighted and forget about the Chinese revolution and the world revolution; if the pressure comes from a strong sense of responsibility for the revolutionary cause and hatred for the enemy, this pressure is the driving force for progress. The Party's warmth and the masses' help made my mind clear and gave me a hundredfold strength in ideological transformation.

Daring to "expose" one's thoughts is itself a struggle between "public" and "private." Having selfish thoughts, one might think that transformation is a personal matter. Therefore, even if one "exposes," it is only half-hidden and half-exposed, leaving a "tail." Chairman Mao said: "Chinese Communists are willing to sacrifice everything for the people, and at any time, they are ready to give up their lives for our cause. Is there any thought, viewpoint, opinion, or method that does not meet the needs of the people and is reluctant to give up?" Chairman Mao's teachings tell us: transforming thoughts is for the revolution, it is for the public. As long as one thinks of transforming for the revolution, one will be more courageous and thorough in exposing one's thoughts. Previously, I also had concerns: if I expose myself so thoroughly, will others seize my "weakness"? Later, after studying "On Contradiction" and "On Practice," I understood that ideological issues are objectively existing. Whether you admit it or not, it is still a problem. Having contradictions in one's thoughts, the more one covers them up, the worse it gets. Not exposing contradictions means not being able to solve contradictions. If there are "weaknesses" of bourgeois ideology in one's mind, how can they be hidden? One must seize them, and welcome everyone to seize them. Seize it and completely cut it off.

　　彻底地“亮”出来
　　解放军某部政治协理员  杨道根
    一个人的思想改造不能离开群众。因此，改造思想的自觉性也表现在能不能依靠群众，敢不敢依靠群众。
    有一段时间，我经常受到表扬。我想：自己身体有病，能力又差，越表扬，压力越大。后来，在报纸上看到一些怎样对待压力的文章，一对照，原来是自己思想上又长“毛”了。怕领导表扬多了，群众的眼睛都瞅着我，有一点问题，也会引起人家的注意。因此，不希望上级表扬，并不是谦虚，而是怕群众监督。我意识到这是革命斗志开始衰退，私心杂念开始抬头的问题。虽然是苗头，却不能等闲视之。
    那么，这种内心深处的问题怎么改起呢？是悄悄改还是“亮”出来呢？毛主席说：“一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益”。有怕群众监督的患得患失的思想，就更要找群众来监督自己，这才是襟怀坦白。于是我便把这个问题向领导和周围的同志“亮”了出来。这么一“亮”，很快就传到领导同志耳朵里去了。政委找我谈话说：“怕群众监督，就是脱离群众的开始；一个人抛开了‘我’字，你就会感到一刻也离不开党，离不开群众。”后来，我又听到一个同志说：我原来还不知道杨道根有这个问题，今后要瞅着点帮助他。听了这话，我觉得心里暖烘烘的。因为这个同志从来不给我提意见，现在也开始关心我了。以后，同志们又帮助我分析：如果压力来自“我”字，这种压力是腐蚀剂，把人压得鼠目寸光，忘掉中国革命和世界革命；压力来自对革命事业的强烈责任感，来自对敌人的仇恨，这种压力就是前进的动力。党的温暖，群众的帮助，使我的头脑清醒了，也使我在思想改造上增加了百倍的力量。
    敢不敢“亮”思想，本身就是“公”和“私”的斗争。有私心杂念，认为改造是私人的事，那么，即使是“亮”，也是半“隐”半“亮”，留着个“尾巴”。毛主席说：中国共产党人“不惜牺牲自己个人的一切，随时准备拿出自己的生命去殉我们的事业，难道还有什么不适合人民需要的思想、观点、意见、办法，舍不得丢掉的吗？”毛主席的教导告诉我们：改造思想是为革命，是为公，只要想到为革命而改造，你就会更勇敢、更彻底地“亮”出思想来。以前，我也顾虑：这样彻底地“亮”了出来，别人是不是会抓住自己的“小辫子”呢？以后，学习了《矛盾论》、《实践论》，懂得了思想问题是客观存在，你承认也好，不承认也好，它总是个问题。思想上有矛盾，越掩盖，越糟糕。不揭露矛盾，就不可能解决矛盾。脑袋里既然有资产阶级思想的“小辫子”，那还藏得住呀？只有自己抓，也欢迎大家来抓。抓住它，彻底割掉它。
