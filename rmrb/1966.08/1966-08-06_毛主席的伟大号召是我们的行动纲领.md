The 700 million people are determined to become critics of the old world, builders and defenders of the new world. Chairman Mao's great call is our action program.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 5th, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao's call to turn every industry into a revolutionary school that combines work, agriculture, culture, and military affairs has been transmitted to various places. People enthusiastically cheered, saying that Chairman Mao's words expressed the hopes of the 700 million people nationwide. Chairman Mao's words contain the happiness of the people nationwide. They expressed their determination to follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, to advance steadfastly, to become critics of the old world, builders and defenders of the new world, to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and to sail the revolutionary ship towards communism.

People in various places, while discussing Chairman Mao's great call, pointed out unanimously that Chairman Mao's words are the highest in level and the greatest in power. Chairman Mao, at every critical moment in the revolution, has pointed out a clear direction for us to advance. To accomplish this great historical task proposed by Chairman Mao, the most important and fundamental thing is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively. Deputy Secretary of the Party Branch of Chengguan Commune, Han Village Brigade, Lanxian County, Henan Province, Yang Suolan, excitedly read Chairman Mao's instruction to the cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants. She said, "We poor and lower-middle peasants deeply feel that Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. We will resolutely follow Chairman Mao to make revolution for life. We must learn from the PLA to turn the countryside into a revolutionary school, greatly raise the peasants' consciousness of proletarian revolution, and struggle for the accomplishment of the great historical task proposed by our most beloved leader Chairman Mao." Bridget Wu, Party Branch Secretary of Zhao Mengtao Group, Northwest No. 1 Cotton Mill, said: Our group, through more than ten years of revolutionary practice, feels that to build socialism and communism successfully, we must first nurture new people of communism with Mao Zedong Thought. Our task is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works better, to temper ourselves into communists with high political consciousness and all-round development, and to carry the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought to communism.

On the 4th, more than 8,000 people from various circles in Shenyang held a rally to resolutely turn every industry into a Mao Zedong Thought school. A responsible comrade of the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee said at the meeting that regarding Chairman Mao's latest instruction, we must immediately launch a large-scale learning activity, a large-scale propaganda activity, and a large-scale implementation activity throughout the city. We must push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage.

The people of the revolutionary base areas feel particularly close to Chairman Mao's great instruction. The people of Jinggangshan, the first revolutionary base area personally created by Chairman Mao, have held meetings in recent days. Old Red Army soldier and Deputy Director of the Jinggangshan Management Bureau, Zhu Xuan, excitedly said, "When Chairman Mao led the Red Army to make revolution in Jinggangshan, it was with one hand holding a gun and the other holding a hoe, fighting while producing, learning politics, military affairs, and culture. Now Chairman Mao calls for turning every industry into a revolutionary school that combines work, agriculture, culture, and military affairs, which has great historical significance and is our action program. We must carry forward the revolutionary traditions of Jinggangshan and truly turn Jinggangshan into a Mao Zedong Thought school."

The people of the revolutionary holy land Yan'an, upon learning of Chairman Mao's great instruction, spread the news and were extremely excited. Chen Youma, an old member of the Red Guards in Zaoyuan Brigade, said: Chairman Mao's great call is a creative development of Marxism-Leninism. As early as the Anti-Japanese War period, our army and people followed Chairman Mao's instructions, fighting while training and producing, learning military affairs, politics, and culture. The soldiers and civilians were like one family, and together they defeated Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Today we must listen to Chairman Mao's words, continue to carry forward this glorious revolutionary tradition, and march towards communism victoriously.

Many people have proven with their personal experiences that as long as they act according to Chairman Mao's brilliant ideas, they will be invincible. Many people expressed their determination to respond to Chairman Mao's great call with practical actions immediately. Some agricultural labor models and active learners of Chairman Mao's works participating in the meeting of county magistrates and mayors in Shandong Province in Huang County were full of passion and unanimously expressed their support for Chairman Mao's great instruction. Zhang Yiai, the head of Xiaozhaizi Brigade, Chengyang Commune, Laoshan County, said: When we established the people's commune, our great leader Chairman Mao advocated the integration of workers, peasants, soldiers, and merchants. Since the establishment of the commune, we have seriously implemented Chairman Mao's instructions, insisted on taking agriculture as the mainstay, and set up more than a dozen small factories and sideline projects. We also established a semi-agricultural and semi-study agricultural middle school and a militia company. All the brigade members participated in the study of Chairman Mao's works. Recently, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we actively participated in the criticism of the bourgeoisie. We deeply feel that by acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, the Chinese people can truly become critics of the old world, builders and defenders of the new world.

Lu Binghu, currently the deputy commander of the military sub-district of Jishou, Hunan Province, who participated in the great production movement in Baiziwan, Yan'an, recalled the process of the great production movement at that time. He said, "Today, we want to build our country to be very prosperous and strong, to strive for the victory of the world revolution, and there is still a lot of work to be done, but the most important thing is to make all the people in the country master Mao Zedong Thought and turn every industry into a Mao Zedong Thought school."

High school teacher Gao Caixia from Jiangdong, Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, said, "Chairman Mao's great call is our action program." She said, Jiangdong Middle School is a half-work and half-study school. In recent years, we have insisted on this educational system according to the teachings of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. She said, we must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, further improve our half-work and half-study school, and take the PLA as an example to turn the school into a Mao Zedong Thought school.

The pastoral "Dazhai" - the herdsmen of Wushenzhao Commune enthusiastically hailed Chairman Mao's great call. The Party Committee Secretary of the commune, Chaogelang, said: "We herdsmen take animal husbandry as the mainstay, and in the future, we will also engage in agricultural and sideline production. We must also learn politics, military affairs, and culture, participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and criticize the bourgeoisie. Chairman Mao's wise instruction has pointed out a clear direction for the herdsmen of Wushenzhao Commune to advance." Since 1964, the organizational department of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has made remarkable achievements in realizing the revolutionization of the organization. This time, they expressed their determination to continue to take the PLA as an example, to further realize the revolutionization in ideology, leadership methods, work style, and organizational system, and to be thorough revolutionaries of the proletariat. More than 130 cadres of the county committee organization, except for leaving 25 people to handle the daily work of the organization, all went to the countryside to set up model points with Chairman Mao's works, to be both cadres and peasants, to actively lead the masses to study Chairman Mao's works, to promote the three great revolutionary movements, and to determine to turn the whole county into a Mao Zedong Thought school.

    七亿人民决心成为旧世界的批判者、新世界的建设者和保卫者
    毛主席的伟大号召是我们的行动纲领
    据新华社五日讯　我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席关于把各行各业都办成亦工亦农、亦文亦武的革命化大学校的伟大号召传到各地，人们热烈欢呼毛主席的话说出了全国七亿人民的希望，毛主席的话里，蕴藏着全国人民的幸福。他们表示一定要沿着毛主席指引的方向，坚定不移向前进，做一个旧世界的批判者、新世界的建设者和保卫者，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，把革命的航船一直驶向共产主义。
    各地的人们在讨论毛主席这一伟大号召时纷纷指出，毛主席的话水平最高，毛主席的话威力最大，毛主席在革命的每一个关键时刻都给我们指出了明确的前进方向，要实现毛主席提出的这一伟大历史任务，最重要最根本的一条，就是要活学活用毛主席著作。河南省兰考县城关公社韩村大队党支部副书记杨素兰兴奋地向干部和贫农下中农社员宣读了毛主席的这一指示。她说：“我们贫农下中农深深体会到，毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，我们要坚决跟随毛主席闹一辈子革命。我们一定要象解放军那样，把农村办成革命化的大学校，大大提高农民的无产阶级思想觉悟，为实现我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席提出的伟大历史任务而斗争。”全国纺织工业系统学习毛主席著作积极分子、西北国棉一厂赵梦桃小组党小组长吴桂贤说：我们小组通过十多年的革命实践，感到要胜利建设社会主义，胜利建成共产主义，就先要用毛泽东思想哺育共产主义的新人。我们的任务就是要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，把自己锻炼成具有高度政治觉悟的、全面发展的共产主义新人，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗一直扛到共产主义。
    沈阳市各界八千多人四日举行了坚决把各行各业办成毛泽东思想大学校的誓师大会。中共沈阳市委负责人在会上表示，对毛主席的这一最新指示，要立即在全市范围内，掀起一个大规模的学习活动，大规模的宣传活动，大规模的贯彻执行的活动。把活学活用毛主席著作的群众性运动，推向一个新的阶段。
    革命老根据地的人民对毛主席的这一伟大指示特别感到亲切。毛主席亲手创建的第一个革命根据地的井冈山人民，连日来纷纷举行座谈会。老红军战士、井冈山管理局副局长朱轩兴奋地说，当年毛主席领导红军在井冈山闹革命的时候，就是一手拿枪，一手拿锄，一面打仗，一面生产，既学政治，又学军事、文化。现在毛主席又号召各行各业都办成亦工亦农、亦文亦武的革命化大学校，这具有伟大的历史意义，是我们的行动纲领。我们一定要发扬井冈山的革命传统，把井冈山真正办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    革命圣地延安的人民得知毛主席的伟大指示以后，奔走相告，兴奋异常。枣园大队老赤卫队员陈有马说：毛主席的这一伟大号召是对马克思列宁主义的又一创造性的伟大发展。早在抗日战争时期，我们的军队和人民就按照毛主席的指示，边打仗，边训练，边生产，既学军事，又学政治，又学文化。军民亲如一家人，共同打败了日本帝国主义和国民党反动派。今天我们更要听毛主席的话，继续发扬这一光荣革命传统，胜利地走向共产主义。
    许多人以亲身的经历证明，只要按照毛主席的这一光辉思想办事，就会无往而不胜。许多人表示要立即用实际行动来响应毛主席的这一伟大号召。正在黄县参加山东省专员、县长会议的部分农业劳动模范和学习毛主席著作积极分子，满怀激情地一致表示热烈拥护毛主席这一伟大指示。崂山县城阳公社小寨子大队队长张以爱说：在办人民公社的时候，我们伟大领袖毛主席就提倡工农兵学商五位一体。公社化以来，我们认真贯彻了毛主席的指示，坚持以农为主，并办起了十几个小工厂和副业项目，还成立了半农半读的农业中学，建立了民兵连，全大队社员都参加了毛主席著作的学习。最近，在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们又积极参加批判资产阶级。我们深刻体会到，按照毛主席的指示去做，我国人民就能真正成为旧世界的批判者，新世界的建设者和保卫者。
    曾经在延安豹子湾参加过大生产运动的现任湖南吉首军分区副司令员罗斌虎，回忆了当年大生产运动的经过。他说，今天，我们要把我国建设得非常富强，要争取世界革命的胜利，还有许多工作要做，但最主要的一条，是要使全国人民都掌握毛泽东思想，把各行各业办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    浙江宁波市江东中学教师高彩霞说，毛主席的伟大号召，就是我们的行动纲领。她说，江东中学就是一所半工半读学校，几年来，我们按照党中央和毛主席的教导，坚持了这个教育制度。她说，我们一定要遵照毛主席的指示，进一步办好我们的半工半读学校，并且以解放军为榜样，把学校办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    牧区“大寨”——乌审召公社的干部和社员们热烈欢呼毛主席的伟大号召。公社党委书记朝格朗说：“我们牧民以牧业为主，今后也要搞农副业生产。还要学政治、学军事、学文化，参加无产阶级文化大革命，批判资产阶级。毛主席的这一英明指示，为我们乌审召公社的牧民们指出了明确的前进方向。”中共湖南省岳阳县委机关从一九六四年大学解放军以来，在实现机关革命化方面取得了显著成就。这次他们表示要继续坚持以解放军为榜样，坚决从思想上、领导方法上、工作作风上、组织制度上，进一步实现革命化，作无产阶级的彻底革命派。县委机关一百三十多名干部，除留二十五人主持机关日常工作外，其余全部带着毛主席著作到农村去蹲点搞样板，既当干部，又当农民，积极领导群众学习毛主席著作，推动三大革命运动，决心把全县办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
