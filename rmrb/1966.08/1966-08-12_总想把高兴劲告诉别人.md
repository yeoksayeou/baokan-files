	Always Wanting to Share My Joy with Others

	Lu Jianhua is a sixth-grade student at Houda Li Primary School in Beijing. The day before yesterday, after seeing Chairman Mao, he wrote the following enthusiastic letter to his uncle who works in the army.

	Uncle:

	I want to tell you some very, very happy news. I saw our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao.

	Yesterday afternoon at around seven o'clock, I was watching the parade on Fuyou Street. Suddenly, someone shouted, "Chairman Mao is here." I saw Chairman Mao, with a radiant face, getting out of the car. I immediately ran over. While running, I shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!" Many people ran forward to shake hands with Chairman Mao, but I couldn't get close, so I shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" as loudly as I could. I thought, I must shout so that Chairman Mao can hear me, so that more people know that Chairman Mao is here and come out to see Chairman Mao.

	When Chairman Mao left, we all followed his car. The car moved slowly, and Chairman Mao waved to us from inside the car. I followed all the way to the gate of Zhongnanhai before jumping and skipping back home. From far away, I shouted to Grandma, "Grandma, Grandma! I saw Chairman Mao." Grandma was cooking, and upon hearing that I saw Chairman Mao, she scolded, "You saw Chairman Mao, why didn't you come back to tell me? The rice is burnt, but I also want to see Chairman Mao."

	Uncle: Do you think Grandma isn't happy? Not at all! She heard that Chairman Mao is very healthy and doesn't have much white hair, and she was overjoyed. She said, "I heard that Chairman Mao went swimming and swam thirty li, and I was so happy."

	I was even happier. Last night, I kept running on the street, asking everyone, "Did you see Chairman Mao?" I always wanted to share my joy with others.

	Uncle: You must be very happy too! I promise you, I will definitely study Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Chairman Mao tells us to study hard, so I will study hard.

	Uncle, you must also study Chairman Mao's works, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao.

	With revolutionary greetings,
	Lu Jianhua, August 11

### 总想把高兴劲告诉别人

　　总想把高兴劲告诉别人
　　卢建华是北京市后达里小学六年级学生。前天，他看到毛主席后，给他在解放军工作的叔叔，写了这样一封热情洋溢的信
　　叔叔：你好！
    我告诉你一件特别特别高兴的大喜事，我见到了咱们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席了。
    昨天下午七点多钟，我正在府右街看前来报喜的队伍，忽然有人喊：“毛主席来了。”我看见红光满面的毛主席走下汽车，我马上跑上去。一边跑，一边喊：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”许多人跑上前去和毛主席握手，我挤不上去，就使劲喊“毛主席万岁”。我心想，一定要喊得使毛主席听见是我喊的，喊得使更多的人都知道毛主席来了，出来看毛主席。
    毛主席回去的时候，我们都跟着毛主席的汽车跑。汽车走得很慢，毛主席坐在汽车里还向我们招手。我直跟到中南海的门口，才蹦呀跳呀回家去。老远老远，我就喊奶奶：“奶奶，奶奶！我看到毛主席了。”奶奶正在做饭，听说我看到毛主席，埋怨说：“你看到毛主席，怎么不回来喊我。把饭烧糊了，我也要看看毛主席。”
    叔叔：你以为奶奶不高兴吗？那才不呢！听说毛主席很健康，还没有多少白头发，可乐了。她说：“听说毛主席去游泳，还游三十华里，我就乐得不得了。”
    我更乐了，昨天晚上，我老在街上跑，遇人就问：“你看到毛主席了吗？”总想把自己的高兴劲告诉别人。
    叔叔：你一定也很高兴吧！我向你保证，我一定要好好读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，按照毛主席的指示办事。毛主席叫我们好好学习，我就好好学习。
    叔叔，你也一定要好好学习毛主席著作，听毛主席的话，做毛主席的好战士。
    此致革命的敬礼
                            卢建华　八月十一日
