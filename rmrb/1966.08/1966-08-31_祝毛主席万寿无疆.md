The great thought of Mao Zedong shines brightly over the whole world, and he is the guiding star and torch in our hearts. In the struggle against imperialism and all bloodsuckers, studying the great works of Chairman Mao will surely lead to victory.

This is a poem written by a friend from Zanzibar named Longduo after visiting the recent Chinese Arts and Crafts Exhibition held in Zanzibar City, Tanzania. The poem enthusiastically praises the most beloved leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao.

The people of Zanzibar, living on the world-famous "Island of Cloves," like people all over the world, hold Chairman Mao in the highest respect and affection. They regard Chairman Mao as the greatest leader of all the peoples of the world.

At the Chinese Arts and Crafts Exhibition, many Zanzibari visitors stood before the statue of Chairman Mao, raising their hands in salute with deep respect and love. They expressed their common wishes for Chairman Mao in the visitors' book.

A Zanzibari friend who had visited China became excited when seeing various artworks depicting Jinggangshan, Yan'an, and Tiananmen. He said, "From Jinggangshan to Yan'an, from Yan'an to Beijing, this is the path taken by Chairman Mao in leading the Chinese people to victory in armed struggle. This is also the path to victory for the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America."

The revolutionary-spirited people of Zanzibar hold deep feelings for the works of Chairman Mao. A worker from the Zanzibar Printing Press who had read Chairman Mao's works praised, "Mao Zedong Thought is the sword in the hands of the people to slay the imperialist devil. Today, the peoples of the world especially need the teachings of Chairman Mao Zedong."

The Zanzibari friends felt particularly close to the statues of African freedom fighters at the exhibition. They felt the sympathy and support of the Chinese people for the African people through these artworks.

The people of Tanzania deeply feel that the great achievements of the Chinese people in all fields are due to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao. Visitor Abbas Muhammad wrote in the visitors' book: "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have achieved brilliant results in a short period. You are the example for the African people. Your victories fill us with confidence. Long live Chairman Mao forever!"

    祝毛主席万寿无疆
    “伟大的毛泽东思想光辉时刻照耀全世界，他在我们的心目中是指路的星星和火炬。 在反对帝国主义和一切吸血鬼的斗争中，学习毛主席的伟大著作就一定会取得胜利。”
    这是一位名叫龙多的桑给巴尔朋友参观了最近在坦桑尼亚桑给巴尔市举行的中国工艺美术展览会后，在留言簿上写下的热情颂扬中国人民最敬爱的领袖毛主席的一首诗。
    生活在这个闻名世界的“丁香之岛”上的桑给巴尔人民，同世界各地人民一样，对毛主席充满着无比的尊敬和爱戴。他们把毛主席看作是全世界人民的最伟大的领袖。
    在中国工艺美术展览会上，许多桑给巴尔观众站在毛主席塑像前面，怀着对毛主席的崇高敬意和热爱，举手致敬。他们在留言簿上表达对毛主席的共同祝愿。
    一位访问过中国的桑给巴尔朋友看到描绘井冈山、延安和天安门的各种工艺品时兴奋地说，
  “从井冈山到延安，从延安到北京，是毛主席领导中国人民进行武装斗争取得革命胜利的道路。这也是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民斗争胜利的道路”。
    富有革命精神的桑给巴尔人民对毛主席著作怀着深厚的感情。桑给巴尔印刷厂一位读过毛主席著作的工人赞扬说，“毛泽东思想是人民手中斩除帝国主义魔鬼的利剑。今天，世界人民特别需要毛泽东主席的教导”。
    桑给巴尔朋友在展览会上看到非洲自由战士的塑像格外感到亲切。他们从这些艺术作品中感受到中国人民对非洲人民的同情和支持。
    坦桑尼亚人民深深体会到，中国人民在各方面取得的巨大成就，是由于毛主席的英明领导。观众阿巴斯·穆罕默德在留言簿上写道：“中国人民在毛主席领导下，在短短的时期内取得了辉煌的成就。你们是非洲人民的榜样。你们的胜利使我们充满了信心。祝毛主席万寿无疆！”　新华社记者
