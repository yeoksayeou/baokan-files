The public report of the Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee reached Shanghai yesterday and today, the entire city was in a state of joyous celebration. People enthusiastically cheered and sang in praise of the new victories of Mao Zedong Thought.

Over the past two days, the streets of Shanghai have been filled with crowds, with red flags waving everywhere. Hundreds of thousands of people have gathered around portraits of Chairman Mao, singing and dancing their way to the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China to participate in celebratory parades, expressing their firm support for the plenum's public report and their determination to carry out the great call made in the report. The shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live the Communist Party of China!" have echoed throughout the city.

The revolutionary masses of Shanghai have, through their own struggles, deeply felt that the series of major decisions made by our great leader Chairman Mao over the past four years are the most magnificent, the most brilliant, and the most correct. They represent the newest development of Marxism-Leninism and the most outstanding contribution to the international communist movement. Chairman Mao's direction is the direction from victory to victory, the direction that ensures our country's progress from socialism to communism, and the direction that ensures the ultimate victory of the world revolution.

The public report of the Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee has given the Shanghai workers, who are bravely fighting to achieve the country's third five-year plan, boundless strength. Nine years ago, our most beloved leader Chairman Mao personally inspected the No. 1 Cotton Mill. After hearing the report, the workers' revolutionary enthusiasm surged. Preservation worker Xiong Fulin immediately wrote a poem of praise: "A thunderous spring thunder shakes the heavens, the Central Committee's public report spreads far and wide, every word and sentence shines with golden light, singing in praise across the five continents and four seas. Singing in praise of the great leader Chairman Mao, singing in praise of the great Communist Party of China!"

The entire workforce of the Wujing Chemical Factory, which is the first set of large-scale nitrogen fertilizer plants designed, manufactured, and installed by our country, immediately wrote hundreds of large red joyous reports after listening to the report.

Chen Afa, a young worker from the Forward Lock Factory who has been fighting to defend Mao Zedong Thought, has used Mao Zedong Thought as the sharpest weapon to write dozens of critical articles over the past two years, fiercely fighting against the big and small "kings of hell" like Yang Xianzhen, Feng Ding, Wu Han, Deng Tuo, and Zhou Yang, and the ghosts and snakes in the factory. This once-unknown young man has become a pioneer in criticizing the bourgeoisie. Yesterday, Chen Afa, with boundless respect, repeatedly studied the report. He said passionately: We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end.

The cadres and members of the suburban people's communes listened to the broadcast and immediately held discussions. Ten years ago, Chairman Mao wrote an annotation for the article "White Yiji Bridge Vegetable Production Cooperative from Primary to Advanced." Now, White Yiji Bridge Advanced Cooperative has developed into a Pengpu People's Commune that has basically achieved agricultural mechanization and comprehensive development of agricultural and sideline production. The members of this commune today expressed their special excitement and their boundless faith, love, and admiration for the Party and Chairman Mao. The commune director Chen Changgen said excitedly: "We must more resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions and turn the countryside into a great school for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought."

The suburban farmers of Shanghai, who are currently engaged in rush harvesting and planting, listened to the broadcast of the report in the fields today while working hard. The members of Xujing Commune in Jiading County said that since the Eighth Plenum of the Central Committee, especially since the launch of the socialist education movement, our entire commune has launched a wave of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. One hundred and twenty-six production teams have established study groups for Chairman Mao's works. Spirit turns into matter, and in these few years, production has also made great strides. In 1962, the grain yield per mu was only one thousand jin, and in 1965, it has reached more than one thousand five hundred jin. All of this is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

The revolutionary teachers and students of various universities and secondary schools in Shanghai, who are at the forefront of the proletarian cultural revolution, are overflowing with revolutionary enthusiasm. They enthusiastically cheered, sang, and danced, writing numerous joyous reports and declarations of determination. They vowed to use Mao Zedong Thought, the most powerful and sharpest ideological weapon, to sweep away all ghosts and snakes, criticize old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits, and be the brave pioneers of educational reform, carrying the proletarian cultural revolution to the end.

The soldiers of the army, navy, and air force stationed in Shanghai are all boiling with enthusiasm, and declarations of determination and guarantees are flying like snowflakes to various leadership organs of the units. They vowed to firmly listen to Chairman Mao's words, to train hard and master the skills to defeat the enemy, to be ready at any time to strike the invading enemy, and to definitely plant the five-star red flag on the sacred territory of Taiwan.

The one thousand people of Shanghai solemnly declare to the Central Committee and Chairman Mao: We will firmly respond to the call of the Central Committee's plenum, firmly carry out the public report of the Central Committee's plenum, and forever follow the Central Committee and Chairman Mao forward in the great winds and waves! Forever with the people of the whole country and the revolutionary people of the whole world, we will carry on the struggle against American imperialism and its running dogs to the end, carry on the struggle against modern revisionism to the end, and push the revolution of China, the international proletariat, and the people of the world forward!

The more than 7,000 students, teachers, and staff of Shanghai Jiaotong University were in a state of excitement after hearing the news of the public report of the Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee. Students sang revolutionary songs such as "The Brilliance of Chairman Mao" in the campus, danced the Yangge, and enthusiastically celebrated the new victories of Mao Zedong Thought.

　　上海一千万人民热烈欢呼党的八届十一中全会公报
　　毛主席的重大决策是对马列主义的新发展
　　毛主席指出的方向是从胜利到胜利的方向
    据新华社上海十四日电　党的八届十一中全会公报传到上海以后，昨天和今天全市一片欢腾。人们纵情欢呼、热烈歌唱战无不胜的毛泽东思想的新胜利。
    这两天，上海街头人山人海，红旗如林，千百万人簇拥着毛主席的画像，载歌载舞，涌向中共上海市委所在地，举行庆祝游行，表示坚决拥护全会公报，坚决执行公报所提出的伟大号召。“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”的欢呼声，激荡着整个城市的上空。
    上海广大革命群众从自己的斗争实践中，最强烈地感受到，我们伟大的领袖毛主席近四年来提出的一系列重大决策，是最最伟大、最最英明、最最正确的，是对马克思列宁主义最新的发展，是对国际共产主义运动最杰出的贡献。毛主席的方向，就是从胜利走向胜利的方向，就是保证我国从社会主义走向共产主义的方向，就是保证世界革命取得彻底胜利的方向。
    党的八届十一中全会公报，给正在为实现我国第三个五年计划而英勇奋战的上海工人，以无穷无尽的力量。九年前，我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席亲临视察过的国棉一厂，工人们听了公报，革命的激情奔放。保全工熊福林当场写了赞颂诗：“春雷一声震天响，党中央公报传四方，字字句句闪金光，五洲四海齐欢唱。歌颂伟大的领袖毛主席，歌颂伟大的中国共产党！”
    我国第一套自己设计、制造、安装的大型氮肥厂——吴泾化工厂，全体工人收听公报后，立即写出了数百张大红喜报。
    为捍卫毛泽东思想而冲锋陷阵的前进锁厂青年工人陈阿发，近两年来用毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器，陆续写了几十篇批判文章，狠斗杨献珍、冯定、吴晗、邓拓、周扬之流大大小小的“阎王”，狠斗本厂的牛鬼蛇神。这个本来不出名的青年成了批判资产阶级的闯将。昨天，陈阿发以无限崇敬的心情，一次又一次地学习公报，他激情地说：我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    郊区人民公社广大干部和社员听完广播以后纷纷举行座谈。十年前，毛主席曾为《白遗桥蔬菜生产合作社由初级社转到高级社》一文写过按语，现在，白遗桥高级社已经发展成为一个基本实现了农业机械化的、农副业生产全面发展的彭浦人民公社。这个公社的社员今天怀着特别激动的心情，表达自己对党对毛主席的无限信仰、无限热爱、无限崇拜的心情。公社社长陈长根激动地说：“我们要更坚决地按照毛主席的指示办事，把农村办成一所活学活用毛泽东思想的大学校。”
    正在进行抢收抢种的上海郊区农民，今天在田间一面紧张地劳动，一面又一次听公报的广播，他们越听劲越大。嘉定县徐行公社社员说，党的八届十中全会以来，特别是开展社会主义教育运动以来，我们全社掀起活学活用毛主席著作热潮，一百二十六个生产队，队队成立了毛主席著作学习小组。精神变物质，这几年生产也有了巨大的发展，一九六二年粮食亩产量只有一千斤，一九六五年已达到一千五百多斤。这一切都是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    正在无产阶级文化大革命中冲锋陷阵的上海各大专和中等学校的革命师生洋溢着革命的豪情，他们激动地欢呼、歌唱、跳跃，写了大量的喜报和决心书。他们表示决心用毛泽东思想这个最强大、最锐利的思想武器横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，批判旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，做教学改革的勇敢的闯将，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    驻上海的陆海空三军指战员，个个热情沸腾，决心书、保证书就像雪片一样飞向各个部队的领导机关，他们表示要坚决听毛主席的话，苦练过硬的杀敌本领，时刻准备着打击来犯的敌人，一定要把五星红旗插上祖国的神圣领土台湾。
    上海一千万人民向党中央和毛主席庄严地宣誓：坚决响应党中央全会的号召，坚决执行党中央全会的公报，永远跟着党中央，跟着毛主席在大风大浪中前进！永远和全国人民、全世界革命人民一道，把反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争进行到底，把反对现代修正主义的斗争进行到底，把中国革命、国际无产阶级和世界人民的革命事业推向前进！（附图片）
    上海交通大学七千多学生和教师、员工，收听到党的八届十一中全会公报的消息以后，全校沸腾，学生们在校园里高唱《毛主席的光辉》等革命歌曲，扭着秧歌舞，热烈地欢呼毛泽东思想的新胜利。　新华社记者摄（传真照片）
