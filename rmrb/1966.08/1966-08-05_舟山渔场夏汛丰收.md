The Zhoushan fishery in Zhejiang Province has seen a bumper harvest during the summer fishing season.

Recently, while summarizing their summer fishing production experiences, the broad masses of fishermen said: Mao Zedong Thought is the red sun in our hearts. With it, we dare to fight against the sky and the sea. The bumper harvest in the summer fishing season is all thanks to Mao Zedong Thought. In the early stages of this summer fishing season, due to poor fish catches, over a hundred members of the five motor-sailboat teams from the Tanhong Production Brigade of the Yangshan People's Commune in Shengsi County, under the leadership of the Party branch, insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works as their primary task. They clarified the meaning of fishing for the revolution, overcame various difficulties in the production process, and fished continuously in both southern and northern waters, large and small. They achieved great success in the summer fishing season.

During the summer fishing season, many communes and production brigades in the fishing areas also seriously implemented the policy of developing production in an all-round way and actively carried out diversified operations. In distant-sea operations, some communes in Shengsi County actively promoted the practice of motor-sailboats engaging in multiple types of operations simultaneously. Many rear-area communes mobilized the masses to, while doing a good job in agriculture, near-sea operations, and aquaculture production, actively process fish products. In more than a month, the amount of processed fish has reached over 100,000 dan.

    舟山渔场夏汛丰收
    新华社杭州电　浙江省舟山渔场夏汛丰收。
    最近，广大渔民在总结夏汛生产经验时说：毛泽东思想是我们心中的红太阳，有了它，敢于与天斗，与海斗，夏汛丰收就是靠的毛泽东思想。今年夏汛前期由于鱼发差，嵊泗县洋山公社滩浒大队五对机帆船上的一百多个社员，在党支部领导下，坚持把学习毛主席著作作为首要任务，明确了为革命捕鱼的意义，克服了生产过程中的种种困难，南下北上，大小水连续生产，夏汛取得了很大成绩。
    在夏汛生产中，渔区不少社队还认真地贯彻执行了全面发展的生产方针，积极开展多种经营。在远洋生产中，嵊泗县一些社队积极推广机帆船多种作业兼作。很多后方社队，发动群众，在搞好农业、近洋作业、养殖生产的同时，积极加工鱼货。一个多月来，加工的鱼类已达十万担以上。
