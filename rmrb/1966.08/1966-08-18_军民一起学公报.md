On the evening of the 16th, the air was filled with excitement and joy in the Dongbeiwang Production Brigade, Dongbeiwang People's Commune, in the suburbs of Beijing. The commune members gathered in groups of three or five, heading towards the brigade's "Mao Zedong Thought Study Room." Seventy-four-year-old poor peasant Liu Zhensheng, walking briskly, said enthusiastically, "The propaganda team from the army is coming to tell us about the Central Committee's communiqué! Let's go listen to Chairman Mao's instructions!"

The study room was brightly lit. The propaganda team from a certain regiment of the Air Force was explaining the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee to the commune members. The platoon leader read the communiqué word by word, repeating some parts over and over. The listeners included white-haired old men and women, brigade and commune cadres, militia members, women holding babies, and young students working in the brigade. They listened attentively and took notes, their hearts filled with excitement. Many of the old men and women even wore glasses to take notes.

As soon as the platoon leader finished, the commune members and the soldiers formed small groups and began discussing enthusiastically.

The commune members said: The communiqué shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, speaking directly to the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants! Our brigade's production has been developing year after year. This is all thanks to Chairman Mao's wise leadership and the victory of Mao Zedong Thought!

The soldiers said: Navigating the vast sea requires a helmsman; revolution requires Mao Zedong Thought. Our regiment has consecutively won the "Four Good" title for three years because we prioritize studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, promoting the revolutionization of our thinking. Mao Zedong Thought is the rain and sunshine that nurtures our growth!

Old poor peasant Liu Zhensheng, who used to carry heavy loads in the old society, said excitedly: Mao Zedong Thought is the red sun in our hearts! Chairman Mao teaches us never to forget class struggle. We remember Chairman Mao's teachings, carry out the socialist education movement, and our brigade has seen a revolutionary new scene of great enthusiasm. The revolutionary situation is getting better and better. Chairman Mao's theory on class struggle is our most powerful weapon to defeat all enemies. We must forever follow the communiqué's instructions, grasp this weapon, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end.

The commune members and soldiers talked more and more enthusiastically, more and more excitedly. They spontaneously shouted in unison, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!" and sang revolutionary songs like "Navigating the Vast Sea Requires a Helmsman."

　　军民一起学公报
    十六日夜晚，北京郊区东北旺人民公社东北旺大队第一生产队热气腾腾，一片欢乐。社员们三五成群地向生产队的“毛泽东思想学习室”涌去。七十四岁的老贫农刘振生一边走一边兴冲冲地说着：“解放军的宣传队给我们讲党中央的公报来啦，快去听毛主席的指示呀！”
    学习室里，灯火辉煌，空军某部一连宣传队，在向社员们宣讲党的八届十一中全会公报。排长一字一句地讲着公报内容，有些地方重复了一遍又一遍。听讲的有白发苍苍的老大爷、老大娘，有社队干部、民兵，有怀抱孩子的妇女，也有在生产队参加劳动的青年学生。他们怀着激动的心情，认真地听着，记着。不少老大爷、老大娘们也戴着老花眼镜做着笔记。
    排长一讲完，社员们就和宣传队的战士凑成一个个小组，热烈讨论开了。
    社员们说：公报字字句句闪耀着毛泽东思想的光芒，说到了我们贫下中农的心坎上！咱们队的生产连年发展，这都是毛主席领导英明，是毛泽东思想的胜利！
    战士们说：大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠的是毛泽东思想。我们连能够连续三年获得“四好”称号，就是因为把活学活用毛主席著作放在第一位，促进了思想革命化。毛泽东思想是哺育我们成长的雨露和阳光！
    在旧社会扛长活的老贫农刘振生激动地说：毛泽东思想是我们心中的红太阳！毛主席教导我们千万不要忘记阶级斗争。我们牢记毛主席的教导，开展了社会主义教育运动，队里出现了一派热气腾腾的革命新景象，革命形势好上加好。毛主席关于阶级斗争的理论，是我们贫下中农战胜一切敌人的最强大法宝。我们要永远遵循公报指示，掌握这个法宝，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    社员、战士越谈越热烈，越谈越激动，情不自禁地同声高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”同声高唱《大海航行靠舵手》等革命歌曲。
