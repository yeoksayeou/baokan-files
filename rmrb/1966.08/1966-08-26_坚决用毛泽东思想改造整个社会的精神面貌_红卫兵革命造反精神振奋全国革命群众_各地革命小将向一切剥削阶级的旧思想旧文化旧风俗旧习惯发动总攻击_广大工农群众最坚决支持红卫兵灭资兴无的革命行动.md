The revolutionary rebellious spirit of the Red Guards in the capital has powerfully inspired Red Guards and revolutionary masses across the country. They have ignited a blazing fire to sweep away the reactionary and decaying forces of the bourgeoisie, feudal class, and all old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits. "Let Mao Zedong Thought occupy every position, use Mao Zedong Thought to change the entire society's spiritual outlook, sweep away all ghosts and monsters, remove all obstacles, and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!" This is the battle target of the revolutionary youngsters and the broad revolutionary masses.

According to news from various places, in recent days, Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students in many cities, holding up giant portraits of Chairman Mao, quotations from Chairman Mao, and large banners reading "We are the critics of the old world, we are the builders of the new world," have taken to the streets, beating drums and gongs, holding rallies and speeches, posting big-character posters, and distributing revolutionary leaflets. They have launched a total attack on the reactionary forces of the bourgeoisie and all old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes.

"With a golden monkey wielding a thousand-catty cudgel, the heavens are purified and the dust is swept away." Under the impact of this unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, in just a few days, many old shop names, street names, and other remnants of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism in various places have been quickly thrown into the garbage. The decadent lifestyle of the bourgeoisie and many old customs have been swept away like fallen flowers. Batch after batch of new shop names, street names, and school names, shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought and revolutionary spirit, have been born. Many revolutionary measures beneficial to the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have begun to be implemented. The bourgeoisie has lost its prestige, and the revolutionary masses have raised their heads. Everywhere is a scene of revolutionary fervor, and everywhere is an unstoppable revolutionary torrent. Shouts of "Long live the revolutionary rebellious spirit of the proletariat!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the invincible great Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great leader, great supreme commander, great helmsman, and great teacher Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" echo across the country.

Red Guards from universities and middle schools in Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Changsha, Jinan, Nanchang, Zhengzhou, Hefei, Nanjing, and Fuzhou, inspired by the revolutionary rebellious spirit of the Red Guards in the capital, have extensively carried out propaganda activities. Under their initiative, the names of the Eastern Slope Theater, Eastern Slope Road, and Western Lake Su Causeway in Hangzhou, named after the Song Dynasty feudal scholar Su Dongpo, have all been changed to names with revolutionary significance. Six scissors shops that have used "Zhang Xiaoduan" as their sign for over three hundred years have all changed their names to "Hangzhou Scissors Shop." Revolutionary youngsters in Guangzhou have posted many big-character posters and declarations of war on streets and in shops. The revolutionary workers of one of Guangzhou's three major restaurants, "Taotaojiu," have removed the three-character sign "Taotaojiu" written by Kang Youwei and replaced it with a new sign "Dongfeng Building" written by themselves.

In the Northeast region, in Harbin, Changchun, and Shenyang, revolutionary teachers and students wearing Red Guard armbands have everywhere advocated the abolition of old street names and shop names imposed by imperialism, capitalism, and revisionism. The "Qiulinshangdian" in Harbin, established with the construction of the Chinese Eastern Railway by imperialism, has been renamed.

In Chengdu, Nanning, and Guiyang, revolutionary students carrying giant portraits of Chairman Mao, beating drums and gongs, and posting "Proclamations to Attack the Old World" along the way, have advocated that the revolutionary masses declare war on all old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits. The revolutionary student propaganda team of Sichuan University expressed their determination to resolutely smash black signs and kick away obstacles, making the ancient city of Chengdu shine anew in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Recently, the revolutionary workers of the Park Department Store in Kunming, after hearing the broadcast of the revolutionary spirit of the Red Guards in the capital, discussed: "The name 'Park Department Store' comes from the 'Near Day Tower' of the feudal dynasty and should be immediately reformed." The secretary of the Communist Youth League branch of the store, the female hero Xu Xuehui who lost both hands in a struggle with bandits, said: We not only want to reform the names of shops with feudal, capitalist, and revisionist colors but also want to uproot the thoughts of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism.

The revolutionary youngsters and broad masses of workers in Hebei and Shanxi provinces are continuing to expand their activities to destroy the old and establish the new. The revolutionary workers of the Kaiping Coal Mine have proposed to resolutely smash the old sign of the "Kaiping Coal Mine" left by imperialism and replace the old "worker cards" used by the bureaucratic bourgeoisie to control workers. Workers resolutely advocate changing "worker cards" to "work certificates."

In Hohhot, Urumqi, Yinchuan, and Xining, revolutionary youngsters have written in their big-character posters their determination for thorough revolution: "We will not rest until we destroy the old, and we will not close our eyes until we establish the new. Rebellion is justified!"

Currently, this revolutionary tide is surging, sweeping away the dust of old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of all exploiting classes. Revolutionary youngsters and revolutionary masses have expressed: We must advance and expand our victories. We must ensure that all ghosts and monsters never rise again, uproot the roots of the bourgeoisie and feudal class, and eliminate the breeding ground of revisionism. We must make every street, every industry, every factory, people's commune, and shop into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, a bastion for propagating, implementing, and defending Mao Zedong Thought, and ensure that the ironclad mountains and rivers of the proletariat remain red for generations!

According to the news from Xinhua News Agency on the 25th, the revolutionary rebellious spirit and actions of the Red Guards in the capital and various places have received the most enthusiastic and resolute support from the broad masses of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants. In recent days, revolutionary workers and Red Guard youngsters in many places have fought side by side, sweeping away the decaying remnants and old habits of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes with an irresistible force, jointly celebrating the great victory of destroying the old and establishing the new. They have exchanged Mao's quotations, congratulatory letters, and good news, inspiring and encouraging each other. Many revolutionary workers and poor and lower-middle peasants have also held rallies and parades, enthusiastically cheering the revolutionary rebellion of the Red Guard youngsters, and expressing their support.

In many factories along the Huangpu River in Shanghai, workers have posted big-character posters supporting the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards in the factory gates, corridors, and workshops. Some factories have also sent representatives to join the revolutionary students on the streets to sweep away the old.

Representatives of the Shanghai working class, Yang Fuzhen, Jiang Linggen, Wang Linhe, Meng Dehe, Qi Zhixiao, Cheng Dewang, and Chen Afa, unanimously pointed out that the revolutionary youngsters' fierce attack on the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes is greatly satisfying and well done! It is a thousand times right, ten thousand times right! It is a great battle to destroy the old and establish the new with significant historical significance.

Revolutionary workers in Tianjin have enthusiastically posted big-character posters and written letters of support, determined to join the Red Guard youngsters to smash the old world and sweep away all ghosts and monsters. Revolutionary workers of the Tianjin Railway Workers' Cultural Palace, following the suggestion of revolutionary students, removed the old sign "Ningyuan" and renamed it "July 7th Park," which was welcomed by revolutionary students and workers. The revolutionary workers of the "Zhengyangchun" restaurant, which has already changed its name, expanded the fast-food department welcomed by the working people under the suggestion and encouragement of the Red Guards.

In Wuhan, broad revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres have enthusiastically and resolutely supported the Red Guards' revolutionary actions to sweep away the old, actively participating in the revolution. Zhang Shihan, an 80-year-old worker from the "July 7th" strike and the commander of the daring squad, saw the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards and excitedly said: We participated in the "July 7th" strike in the past, fighting bare-handed against the reactionaries, fearing nothing. Today, I see the Red Guards daring to fight, daring to rebel, and daring to revolution, which I greatly admire. I am completely at ease with our next generation.

The Chongqing Iron and Steel Company held a radio rally today with more than ten thousand workers participating, enthusiastically cheering the daring, fighting, revolutionary, and rebellious spirit of the proletariat of the revolutionary students, expressing their determination to be a strong backing for the revolutionary students. Deputy Chief Engineer Huang Rongchang of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company said: Revolutionary students, in response to Chairman Mao's great call, have fiercely fought against the bourgeoisie, imperialism, revisionism, all ghosts and monsters, and all ideological remnants of the exploiting classes, fully representing the aspirations of our working class. We are determined to strongly support the revolutionary actions of the revolutionary students.

In Zhengzhou, more than a thousand revolutionary workers of Zhengzhou Cotton Mill No. 4 rushed to the streets and fought side by side with the Red Guards, smashing the factory gate with feudal and revisionist colors of "Dragon Head Crane Dance" and the stage of "Chang'e Flying to the Moon." The factory originally produced "Fenghuangtai" cotton cloth, which has been decided to be changed to "Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers" brand. Workers of Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory also joined the Red Guard youngsters to demolish the feudal relics in the factory area, washed the new factory area and workshop signboards, and wrote Mao's quotations and Cultural Revolution slogans.

The broad poor and lower-middle peasants in various rural areas have also expressed their most enthusiastic and resolute support for the revolutionary rebellious actions of the Red Guards. They said, we poor and lower-middle peasants have suffered long-term oppression from feudalism, imperialism, and capitalism, and we understand the great significance of the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards. Their actions are exactly what we want. The mother of hero Liu Yingjun, poor peasant community member Zhu Xiu Lan, said: "Revolutionary youngsters, you did a great job! We poor and lower-middle peasants all support you. Liu Yingjun, when he was alive, listened to Chairman Mao the most and hated the old society the most. He was a fierce warrior in attacking the old. The old world must be broken, and the new world will definitely be established.

In recent days, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants in the suburbs of Urumqi have enthusiastically taken to the streets, beating drums and gongs, holding up banners, and shouting "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" expressing their resolute support for the revolutionary actions of the youngsters, destroying the old and establishing the new, thoroughly smashing the old world, and creating a new world.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xiaocaiyuan Production Team of Tiaoyuan Brigade, Guandu District, suburban Kunming, changed the village name "Xiaocaiyuan" to "Revolutionary New Village." The homes of all 64 households in the team have new portraits of Chairman Mao and quotations from Chairman Mao.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of various ethnic groups, including the Miao, Buyi, and Han, in Chaoyang People's Commune, suburban Guiyang, have enthusiastically held meetings, praising the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards to destroy the old and establish the new.

The emancipated serfs in Lalu Township, suburban Lhasa, after hearing about the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards in the capital, decided to change the township name. They said: Tibet is the world of our emancipated farmers and herdsmen, and we cannot let the name of the traitor Lalu continue to defile our villages.
