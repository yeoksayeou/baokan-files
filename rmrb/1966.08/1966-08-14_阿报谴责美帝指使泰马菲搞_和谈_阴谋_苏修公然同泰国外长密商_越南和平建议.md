Albanian Newspaper Denounces U.S. Imperialism's "Peace Talk" Conspiracy and Soviet Revisionists' Secret Discussions with Thai Foreign Minister

Newspaper "People's Voice" of Albania published an article on August 12, denouncing the U.S. for directing its puppets Thailand, "Malaysia," and the Philippines to serve its "peace talk" fraud in the Vietnam issue.

The article pointed out that the plan to convene a "peace conference" on the Vietnam issue by Thailand, "Malaysia," and the Philippines was manufactured in the plot and fraud factory of the U.S. State Department.

The article pointed out that the Johnson administration has consistently used force and deception in Vietnam, playing the "peace talk" fraud, and receiving strong support from British Prime Minister Wilson, Indian reactionaries, the Tito clique, and Soviet revisionists. Now, the "suggestions" from Thailand, "Malaysia," and the Philippines are merely new tricks in the imperialists' plot to make the Vietnamese people surrender to the aggressors. This has met with increasing opposition from the people of various countries.

According to a report from the New China News Agency on August 13, after the U.S. imperialists directed Thailand, "Malaysia," and the Philippines to propose the convening of an "Asian countries conference" to discuss the Vietnam issue, they directly used this "proposal" to play a new "peace talk" fraud.

According to a report from the American News Agency, White House Press Secretary Moyers announced in Washington on August 12 that Johnson had appointed former Ambassador-at-Large Harriman, who had previously been in charge of promoting the U.S. "peace talk" fraud, to oversee the "peace talk" conspiracy work.

Meanwhile, the Soviet revisionist leadership group is also actively devising strategies to help promote the U.S.'s new "peace talk" conspiracy. According to a report from a Western news agency in Bangkok, "Soviet Ambassador to Thailand Volkov himself requested a meeting with Foreign Minister Koman on August 11." The report said that during the meeting, the Soviet ambassador "sought to clarify the peace proposal put forward by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" and proposed, "whether the 1954 Geneva Accords can still be used as the basis for a final peaceful settlement of the Vietnam issue."

　　阿报谴责美帝指使泰马菲搞“和谈”阴谋
　　苏修公然同泰国外长密商“越南和平建议”
    新华社地拉那十二日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》十二日发表文章，谴责美国指使它的仆从泰国、“马来西亚”和菲律宾为美国在越南问题上的“和谈”骗局效劳。
    文章指出，泰国、“马来西亚”和菲律宾建议召开越南问题的“和平会议”的计划是在美国国务院的阴谋骗局制造所里炮制出来的。
    文章指出，约翰逊政府对越南人民一贯使用武力和欺骗的两手策略，玩弄“和谈”骗局，并且得到英首相威尔逊、印度反动派、铁托集团和苏联修正主义者的大力支持。现在，泰国、“马来西亚”和菲律宾的“建议”只不过是帝国主义者要越南人民在侵略者面前投降的阴谋的花样翻新而已。它受到各国人民越来越强烈的反对。
    据新华社十三日讯　美帝国主义在指使泰国、“马来西亚”和菲律宾提出召开“亚洲国家会议”讨论越南问题的“建议”之后，又利用这个“建议”直接出面玩弄新的“和谈”阴谋。
    据美国新闻处报道，白宫新闻秘书莫耶斯十二日在华盛顿宣布，约翰逊已任命前一个时期一直专门从事推行美国“和谈”骗局的无任所大使哈里曼总管搞“和谈”阴谋的工作。
    与此同时，苏联修正主义领导集团也积极出谋献策，帮助推行美国“和谈”新阴谋。据西方通讯社从曼谷报道，“苏联驻泰国大使沃尔科夫十一日自己要求会见科曼外长”。报道说，这位苏联大使在同科曼会见时“谋求澄清东南亚联盟提出的越南和平建议”，他并且提出，“是否仍然可以把一九五四年日内瓦协议作为最终和平解决越南问题的基础”。
