Marshal Zhu De today severely condemned the U.S. imperialists for instructing Thailand, "Malaysia," and the Philippines to actively prepare for a so-called Asian Nations Conference to discuss the Vietnamese issue.

Marshal Zhu De said, this is a conspiracy serving U.S. imperialism, an act of infringing upon the sovereignty of the Vietnamese people.

Marshal Zhu De made these remarks at a banquet hosted by the Speaker of the Pakistani National Assembly this evening in Beijing.

Marshal Zhu De also said that on August 11, the Head of State of Cambodia, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, clearly pointed out at a press conference that the so-called Asian Nations Conference is a farce concocted by the mouthpieces of the United States, and expressed his firm refusal. The Chinese government and people fully support Prince Sihanouk's just stance.

Marshal Zhu De said, we believe that truly peace-loving countries will be able to see through this conspiracy of U.S. imperialism. All the "peace talks" schemes plotted by U.S. imperialism and its followers will inevitably meet with thorough failure.

	New China News Agency, August 12th: Pakistani National Assembly Speaker Abdul Jabbar Khan and his wife hosted a banquet in Beijing this evening to entertain the leaders of our country.

	Marshal Zhu De and his wife Kang Keqing, Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi and his wife Zhang Qie, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Kang Sheng and his wife Cao Yiou, Vice Chairman Guo Moruo and his wife Yu Liqun, Vice Chairman Saifuddin, and other leaders were invited to attend the banquet.

	Speaker Jabbar Khan delivered a speech at the banquet. He praised the new developments in the traditional friendship between the peoples of Pakistan and China, pointing out that the visit of the Pakistani parliamentary delegation to China this time will surely make the relations between the two countries even closer.

	Speaker Jabbar Khan reiterated that the friendly relations between Pakistan and China are not a temporary expedient but have been tested and are in the interests of the peoples of both countries.

	He expressed his conviction that the friendly relations between Pakistan and China will be further promoted in the coming decades, and that cooperation between the two countries has a broad prospect for development.

	The Speaker said that the Chinese government and people provided extremely valuable assistance to Pakistan in both moral and material terms during the struggle against aggression last year. He once again expressed his gratitude for this. He also thanked China for its consistent support for the struggle of the people of Jammu and Kashmir for the right to self-determination.

	He said that Pakistan believes that China is willing to live in peace with its neighbors. China does not threaten anyone. The facts have proven that our belief is correct.

	Speaker Jabbar Khan warmly praised the great achievements of the Chinese people under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong in all fields. He wished China greater progress and prosperity in the future.

	Marshal Zhu De said in his speech that the visit of the Pakistani guests has already made a beneficial contribution to enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between the peoples of China and Pakistan.

	He said that the Chinese people, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China, are striding forward on the great road of socialist revolution and socialist construction. The political awareness of the broad masses is rapidly increasing, and the whole country has entered a new period of leaps and bounds. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

	Marshal Zhu De said that Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out long ago, "The just struggles of the peoples of all countries in the world are mutually supportive." The Chinese people firmly support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, firmly support the struggles of the peoples of all countries against imperialism and old and new colonialism. The Chinese people firmly support the just struggle of the Pakistani people to safeguard national independence, and firmly support the just struggle of the people of Kashmir for the right to self-determination. We regard this support as our international duty. At the same time, we also thank the Pakistani people for their sympathy and support for our country.

	He said that the Pakistani people can be assured that when you are resolutely countering foreign aggression to safeguard national independence and state sovereignty, the Chinese people will, as always, stand firmly on the side of the Pakistani people. The Chinese people will forever be the most reliable friends of the Pakistani people. Chairman Mao Zedong said: "Friends have true and false, but through practice one can see who is a true friend and who is a false friend." The friendship between the Chinese and Pakistani peoples is a fighting friendship, a friendship that has been tested by practice. We have full confidence in maintaining and developing the friendship between the peoples of China and Pakistan.

	Also invited to attend the banquet were Vice Chairman Xu Bing of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, heads of relevant government departments, leaders of various democratic parties, and leaders of various people's organizations were also invited to attend the banquet. Among them were: Wang Weizhou, Xu Guangping, Mao Yisheng, Luo Shuzhang, Zhao Yimin, Nan Hanchen, Mei Gengbin, Xie Fumin, Lian Guan, Chen Cisheng, Zhao Boping, Han Nianlong, Shi Huibin, Zhang Zhiran, Huang Huoxing, Gao Chongmin, Hu Ziyang, Wang Shaoyao, Ji Fang, Xu Deheng, Chen Qiyou, Hu Juewen, Shen Zizhu, Sha Mengbo, Wang Chuanbin, Le Songsheng, etc. Our Ambassador to Pakistan, Zhang Wenjin, was also invited to attend the banquet.
