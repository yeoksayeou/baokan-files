In June 1961, the gang led by Zhou Yang held a film creation conference in Beijing, openly advocating for bourgeois liberalization and fiercely opposing Mao Zedong Thought.

At the conference, Zhou Yang shouted, "Our films need good stories, good actors, good shots, and good music." Regarding "good actors," Zhou Yang went even further. He said, "We oppose star worship, but we still need stars." He vigorously promoted the idea that "foreigners talk about passion; some films are so passionate about certain actors that they must go see their movies. We should cultivate actors with strong appeal. Directors should discover such actors." He ordered the film industry, "Every year, we should check to see how many morally and talented actors have been cultivated." He openly opposed Chairman Mao's teaching that politics is the soul and the commander, saying, "Morality is abstract, but talent is concrete. The combination of red and expert should emphasize expertise. Although red is first, it must be realized through expertise. Without 'talent,' it is not concrete, not practical." Zhou Yang also advocated learning from capitalist and revisionist films like the "New Wave"; he wanted to make panoramic films and other sets for serving the bourgeoisie.

Chairman Mao taught us, "The literature and art of the proletariat are part of the entire revolutionary cause of the proletariat, just as Lenin said, they are 'gears and screws' in the entire revolutionary machine." Zhou Yang blatantly opposed Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line. His promotion of the "Four Goods" film aimed to turn proletarian films into revisionist films created for and utilized by the bourgeoisie.

After Zhou Yang raised the black flag of the "Four Goods" film, his subordinates, such as Xia Yan, Chen Huangmei, and Yuan Wenshu, held various seminars. Using publications like "Film Art" that they controlled, they vigorously promoted and created public opinion, stirring up a great black wind. They systematically, planned, and organized the film industry to push it onto the path of revisionism. From 1961 to 1964, over four years, they produced a large number of bad films, including "Early Spring in February," "Stage Sisters," "Against the Wind for a Thousand Miles," "Red Sun," "Drafting Soldiers," and "The Peony Pavilion." Especially the poisonous weed "The Enemy at the Gate," Zhou Yang even designated it to be shown during the National Day celebrations in 1964, shooting poisonous arrows at the Party and socialism during the celebration of the 15th anniversary of the founding of the nation. Some film studios had half to two-thirds of their annual productions as bad films. The Xi'an Film Studio produced only one film a year, and this carefully made film was the poisonous weed "The Peony Pavilion."

The above-mentioned batch of poisonous weeds is just a part of the bad films that have already been released. According to Zhou Yang's poisonous recipe for the "Four Goods" film, the films they planned to brew and produce were even more chaotic. Such as "Xie Yaohuan," "The Song of the Eunuch," "Loyal King Li Xiucheng," "The Death of a Famous Actor," "Ruan Lingyu," "Heart Barrier," and so on. All decadent and reactionary things, as long as they have a plot and can attract people—attract Zhou Yang and his gang of black elements, they are all "good stories," all ready to be released.

Under Zhou Yang's call, Xia Yan, Chen Huangmei, and others used the Ministry of Culture they controlled to order all large and small cinemas across the country to hang large photos of "stars," inciting cultural stores and street vendors to mass-produce and sell "star" photos, promoting the already decadent bourgeois "star worship." Zhou Yang vaguely said that "good actors" need "talent," while Chen Huangmei boldly revealed Zhou Yang's true intentions: "good actors" must be "beautiful." Some people in the film industry summed up Zhou Yang's "good actors" in two sentences: "Having virtue is not as good as having talent, having talent is not as good as having looks." This truly exposed the essence of Zhou Yang's "good actors."

The "good shots" that Zhou Yang advocated were to deviate from Mao Zedong Thought and the path of people's war to pursue "innovation." In their eyes, anything that propagates Mao Zedong Thought and praises the heroes of workers, peasants, and soldiers is not a "good shot"; conversely, anything that defames workers, peasants, and soldiers and beautifies landlords and the bourgeoisie is a "good shot." The poisonous weeds "Early Spring in February," "Stage Sisters," "The Enemy at the Gate," etc., are representative works of the "good shots" that this gang of black elements vigorously promoted. The poisonous weed "Red Sun," personally cultivated by the anti-Party vanguard Qu Baiyin, even more "brilliantly" implemented Zhou Yang's proposal for "good shots." They gave reports and wrote articles to promote these "good shots."

The "good music" advocated by Zhou Yang also had a significant effect in films. Yellow, pink, and black music filled many films. For example, the yellow song in "The Visitor on the Ice Mountain," which was sharply criticized by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, won the 1963 film music award at the Changchun Film Studio; the music of the poisonous weeds "The Peony Pavilion" and "Stage Sisters" was also praised as "nationalized" "good music."

To establish the model of the "Four Goods" film, the Zhou Yang gang even picked up the trash from the 1930s and organized the film industry to learn and observe; they "approved" the publication of "History of the Development of Chinese Film," fully praising the films of the 1930s and vigorously promoting the right-opportunist literary line of the 1930s, opposing Chairman Mao's literary line of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers.

We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly eliminate the poison of the "Four Goods" film, expose, criticize, overthrow, and disgrace the ghosts and snakes led by Zhou Yang, and under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end!

### 砍倒“四好”电影的黑旗

　　砍倒“四好”电影的黑旗
    一九六一年六月，周扬一伙在北京召开电影创作会议，公开叫嚣资产阶级自由化，猖狂地反对毛泽东思想。
    周扬在会上叫嚷：“我们的电影，要有好故事，好演员，好镜头，好音乐。”在所谓“好演员”方面，周扬更是大放厥词。他说什么“我们反对明星主义，但还是要有明星。”他竭力鼓吹什么“外国人讲狂热，有些电影狂对某个演员的片子非去看不可。应该培养那些有强烈吸引力的演员，导演应该发现这种演员。”他给电影界下令，“每年要检查一次，看看培养了几个德才兼备的演员。”他公开反对毛主席关于政治是灵魂、是统帅的教导，说什么
  “德是虚的，有了才，才是具体的东西。红专结合，要强调专，红虽是第一，但要通过专才能发挥作用，没有‘才’就不具体，不落实。”周扬还鼓吹向什么“新浪潮”等资本主义、修正主义的电影学习；要搞什么全景电影等一套为资产阶级服务的电影。
    毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级的文学艺术是无产阶级整个革命事业的一部分，如同列宁所说，是整个革命机器中的‘齿轮和螺丝钉’。”周扬明目张胆地反对毛主席的文艺路线，他鼓吹“四好”电影的目的，就是要把无产阶级电影变成为资产阶级而创作、为资产阶级所利用的修正主义电影。
    周扬打出“四好”电影这面黑旗之后，他的麾下大将夏衍、陈荒煤、袁文殊等，便召开各种座谈会，利用他们所把持的《电影艺术》等刊物，卖力兜售，制造舆论，刮起了一股大黑风，有指挥、有计划、有组织地把电影事业推上了修正主义的道路。从一九六一年到一九六四年的四年中，就拍摄了《早春二月》、《舞台姐妹》、《逆风千里》、《红日》、《抓壮丁》、《桃花扇》等一大批坏影片。特别是大毒草《兵临城下》，周扬竟指定列在一九六四年国庆节上演，在庆祝建国十五周年的时候，向党、向社会主义放射毒箭。有些制片厂一年拍摄的影片中，有二分之一到三分之二是坏影片。西安电影制片厂一年只拍了一部影片，这部精心制作的影片就是大毒草《桃花扇》。
    上面举出来的一大批毒草，只是已经出笼的坏影片。而按照周扬的“四好”电影的毒方，准备酝酿炮制的影片，则更是乌七八糟。如《谢瑶环》、《宦娘曲》、《忠王李秀成》、《名优之死》、《阮玲玉》、《心防》等等。所有腐朽的、反动的东西，只要“有个情节”、“能吸引人”——吸引周扬等黑帮分子，就都是“好故事”，都准备抛出来。
    在周扬的号召下，夏衍、陈荒煤等利用他们所把持的文化部，通令全国大小电影院到处张挂“明星”大照片，鼓动文化商店和街头摊贩大量出售
  “明星”照片，宣扬早已腐朽了的资产阶级的“明星主义”。周扬遮遮掩掩地说“好演员”需要有“才”，陈荒煤索性撕掉这块遮羞布，赤裸裸地说出了周扬心里的话：“好演员”就是要“漂亮”。电影界有些人把周扬的“好演员”，归纳为两句话：“有德不如有才，有才不如有貌”。真是一语道破，揭穿了周扬的“好演员”的实质。
    周扬鼓吹的“好镜头”，就是离毛泽东思想之经、叛人民战争之道去搞“创新”。在他们看来，凡是宣传毛泽东思想，歌颂工农兵英雄人物的，都不是
  “好镜头”；反之，丑化工农兵，美化地主资产阶级的，都是“好镜头”。大毒草《早春二月》、《舞台姐妹》、《兵临城下》……就是这伙黑帮分子竭力推崇的“好镜头”的代表作。反党急先锋瞿白音亲手培植的大毒草《红日》，更是“出色”地贯彻了周扬的“好镜头”的主张。他们做报告宣传这些“好镜头”，写文章也宣传这些“好镜头”。
    周扬倡导的“好音乐”，在电影中也大大奏效了。黄色的、粉色的、黑色的音乐充斥在许多影片中。例如曾受到广大工农兵观众尖锐批评的《冰山上的来客》中的黄色歌曲，在长春电影制片厂内竟获得一九六三年影片音乐奖；大毒草《桃花扇》、《舞台姐妹》的音乐，也被捧为“民族化了”的“好音乐”。
    周扬黑帮为了树立“四好”电影的标兵，还把三十年代电影的破烂拣出来，组织电影界学习观摩；“钦定”出版了《中国电影发展史》，全面吹捧三十年代电影，竭力推行三十年代右倾机会主义文艺路线，反对毛主席的为工农兵服务的文艺路线。
    我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底肃清“四好”电影的流毒，把以周扬为首的牛鬼蛇神揭深、批透、斗倒、搞臭，在党中央和毛主席的领导下，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
