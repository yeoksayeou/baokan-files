The highly anticipated 1966 Beijing International Table Tennis Invitational opened tonight at the Beijing Workers' Gymnasium in a grand ceremony.

Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and Vice Premier Chen Yi attended the opening ceremony. Vice Premier He Long and Vice Premier Chen Yi also watched the matches. When our national leaders appeared on the stage, the auditorium erupted in thunderous applause, and the crowd spontaneously shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" for several minutes.

This invitational tournament is being held under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao during the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and at a time when the great thought of Mao Zedong is deeply ingrained in people's hearts. Tonight, the magnificent and grand Beijing Workers' Gymnasium has been renovated and the atmosphere is particularly lively and festive. On the stage, a giant portrait of our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao hangs prominently. Around the hall, Mao's quotations are displayed in both Chinese and English. On the opposite side of the stage, a section of Mao's quotations reads: "The people of the world, unite and defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! The people of the world must have courage, dare to fight, not fear sacrifices, and advance wave upon wave. Then the whole world will belong to the people. All ghosts and monsters will be destroyed." On either side, Mao's quotations read: "U.S. imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. The Chinese people's struggle has proved this. The Vietnamese people's struggle is proving this. We Chinese people firmly support the just struggle of the people of South Vietnam. I am deeply convinced that the people of South Vietnam will achieve the goal of liberating South Vietnam through struggle and make a contribution to the peaceful unification of the motherland."

More than 15,000 spectators attended the opening ceremony. They included workers, people's commune members, revolutionary intellectuals, and Red Guards who were organized during the Cultural Revolution. Everyone was full of spirit, and the atmosphere was filled with high revolutionary enthusiasm. Almost all the spectators brought copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Before the opening ceremony, the stands were filled with scenes of Red Guards leading the audience in reading "Quotations from Chairman Mao," demonstrating the Chinese people's boundless love, respect, and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible thought of Mao Zedong.

At 7:50 PM, the opening ceremony began. The auditorium was brightly lit. More than 15,000 people directed their affectionate gazes towards the giant portrait of the most beloved leader Chairman Mao, and the quotations of Chairman Mao around the hall shone with golden light. At this moment, the entire hall erupted in thunderous applause. The male and female athletes from various countries marched in to the revolutionary melody of "We March on the Great Road." Leading the procession were the Chinese referees, each holding a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Following them were the athletes from Cambodia, Ceylon, Japan, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Lebanon, Nepal, Pakistan, Palestine, Syria, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and Yemen, who entered the hall to the rhythmic applause of the audience. When the athletes from Vietnam, who are on the frontline of the anti-U.S. struggle, and the athletes from Palestine, Yemen, and Lebanon, who are participating in the invitational tournament for the first time, entered the hall, the more than 15,000 spectators in the hall applauded enthusiastically, expressing their warm welcome and respect. The Chinese athletes entered last. The Chinese table tennis athletes, nurtured by the great thought of Mao Zedong, marched with steady steps and high spirits, each holding a bright red copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," demonstrating their resolve to always read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

After the orchestra played the national anthem of the People's Republic of China, Chen Xian, Chairman of the Organizing Committee of the 1966 Beijing International Table Tennis Invitational and Chairman of the Chinese Table Tennis Association, delivered the opening speech.

Chen Xian said: Under the leadership of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people and athletes who are participating in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution extend a warm welcome to our friends from afar. He said that with the joint efforts of friends from various countries, the Beijing International Table Tennis Invitational has been successfully held for two sessions, achieving great success and playing a significant role in promoting the development of world table tennis. We believe that this invitational tournament, under the guidance of the spirit of promoting friendship, mutual advancement, common progress, and unity against imperialism, will once again achieve success and make new contributions to the development of world table tennis.

Chen Xian said that the Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, are carrying out an unprecedented Cultural Revolution, and the Chinese people will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, carry the socialist revolution to the end, strive for the realization of the Third Five-Year Plan, and build our country into a powerful socialist state.

Chen Xian concluded by wishing the 1966 Beijing International Table Tennis Invitational a complete success and hoping that the emerging forces in table tennis will achieve greater success!

Chen Xian's speech was repeatedly interrupted by the enthusiastic applause of the more than 15,000 spectators, who warmly welcomed the increasing number of friends from various countries who have gathered under the banner of anti-imperialism to participate in the Beijing International Table Tennis Invitational.

After Chen Xian's speech, a group of Young Pioneers ran to the stage and the playing field to present flowers to the friends from various countries. After presenting the flowers, according to the audience's request, the orchestra played "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," and the entire audience stood up and sang together, fully demonstrating the revolutionary new image of the Chinese people nurtured by the thought of Mao Zedong.

The opening ceremony was followed by the first round of the men's and women's team matches.
