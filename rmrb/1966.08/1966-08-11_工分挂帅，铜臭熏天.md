	Work Points as the Banner, the Stench of Money Everywhere
	National Labor Model Worker, Vice Chairman of the Provincial Poor Peasants' Association, Secretary of the Party Branch of Nan Gunlongou Brigade, Ping Shan County, Hebei Province, Lǐ Quánshòu

	The anti-party, anti-socialist element Sun Yefang actively advocates for "profits as the banner" and "money as the banner." His intention is to make us implement material incentives and work points as the banner in the countryside, pulling us onto the capitalist road of production for profit and labor for work points. This is in opposition to Mao Zedong Thought as the banner and politics as the banner. Sun Yefang, your fallacies stink of money, and we poor and lower-middle peasants can smell it and will not be deceived!

	Implementing material incentives and work points as the banner is the same as following the landlord and rich peasant line, which is harmful to the development of the collective economy and the socialist revolution. Because the nature of landlords and rich peasants is to want personal wealth. Implementing work points as the banner is like giving them a pillow when they are sleepy. In the past, our village had a production team that was high in yield. However, this team implemented the capitalist management method of material incentives and work points as the banner in its operations. This made households with more labor and fewer people, such as landlords and rich peasants, benefit, while households with less labor and more people, such as poor and lower-middle peasants, suffered.

	Implementing work points as the banner will also foster the capitalist tendencies of the members. High work points and high rewards will make people carry a "fixed star" and "thought scale" in their hearts, picking and choosing the easy and light work, demanding work points and rewards, turning into labor for work points and labor for food. This reflects in production as high and low waves, cold and hot spells, unable to guarantee the completion of production plans and the quality of agricultural work. Sun Yefang, the set of ideas you advocate cannot mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses!

	We lead production by emphasizing politics and Mao Zedong Thought. Our party branch, during the socialist education movement, held a class education exhibition and organized the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to recall bitterness and think of sweetness. Through remembrance and comparison, we raised our class consciousness and clearly recognized that following Chairman Mao's words, the path will not be wrong, thus launching a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

	Chairman Mao said: "Our policy is to rely on our own strength, that is, self-reliance." Chairman Mao's words gave us a timely rain. Everyone agreed that self-reliance is a revolutionary path and proposed: turning the slopes into terraces, building levees in the gullies, which are like countless "small reservoirs," and can definitely control droughts and floods.

	Under the spirit of "self-reliance and striving for strength," we do not feel cold in the bitter winter of the three nines, and we do not feel bitter eating persimmons to break the mountains. In this way, through struggle—failure—struggle again, we comprehensively treated all eleven major gullies and countless minor gullies in the entire brigade, building a total of 550 levees and 25,000 fish-scale pits, planting 250,000 trees. The barren mountains turned green, and the slopes became high-standard terraces with a yield of 1,000 jin per mu. This is not the power given by material incentives, nor is it the power given by work points as the banner, but the great power given by Mao Zedong Thought to make the sky bow and the earth yield.

	Let me tell you, Sun Yefang, you want to restore capitalism, that's like a southern house and a northern bed—no way! We poor and lower-middle peasants are the iron wall and copper wall to defend socialism. We will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry out the Cultural Revolution to the end, and sweep away all ghosts and monsters!

　　工分挂帅，铜臭熏天
　　全国劳动模范、省贫协委员会副主席河北省平山县南滾龙沟大队党支部书记  李全寿
    反党反社会主义分子孙冶方积极鼓吹“利润挂帅”、“钞票挂帅”，他的企图是让我们农村推行物质刺激、工分挂帅，把我们拉到生产为赚钱、劳动为挣工分的资本主义道路上去。这是同毛泽东思想挂帅、政治挂帅相对抗。孙冶方，你的谬论铜臭熏天，我们贫下中农一嗅就觉得不是味儿，决不上你的当！
    搞物质刺激、工分挂帅，就是走地主、富农路线，有害于集体经济的发展，有害于社会主义革命。因为地主、富农的本性，就是想个人发家致富。搞工分挂帅，正是“他瞌睡，给他枕头枕”。过去我们村有个生产队，论产量，是高产队。可是这个队在经营管理上推行了物质刺激、工分挂帅的资本主义经营方式。这就使劳力多、人口少的地主、富农户占了便宜，劳力少、人口多的贫下中农户吃了亏。
    搞工分挂帅，还会助长社员的资本主义思想倾向。搞高工分、高奖励，人们怀里就象揣了“定盘星”、“思想秤”，干活挑肥拣瘦，挑轻躲重，张口要工分，闭口要奖励，形成为工分劳动，为吃饭劳动。反映到生产上，高一潮、低一潮，冷一阵、热一阵，不能保证生产计划的完成，不能保证农活的质量。孙冶方，你宣扬的那一套，根本不能调动群众的积极性！
    我们领导生产靠的是突出政治，突出毛泽东思想。我们的党支部，在社会主义教育运动中，举办了阶级教育展览，组织广大贫下中农群众忆苦思甜。通过回忆对比，我们提高了阶级觉悟，清楚地认识到：听毛主席的话，路子走不岔，从而掀起活学活用毛主席著作高潮。毛主席的话，鼓舞了我们的斗志。
    我们大队过去是穷山恶水，满坡乱石，“有雨满山流，无雨渴死牛”。几千年来，不能改变的暴涝暴旱灾害，压得人透不过气。毛主席说：“我们的方针要放在什么基点上？放在自己力量的基点上，叫做自力更生。”毛主席的话，给我们下了及时雨。大家认定，自力更生是一条革命路，就提出：把坡地修成一块块梯田，把河沟建起一道道谷坊坝，就等于无数个“小水库”，准能治住旱涝。
    我们在“自力更生，奋发图强”的精神鼓舞下，三九寒天不觉冷，吃柿子干劈山不觉苦。就这样，斗争——失败——再斗争，在全大队十一条大沟、无数条小沟，开展综合治理，共修了五百五十多道谷坊坝、二万五千个鱼鳞坑，植树二十五万株，荒山变绿，坡地变成亩产千斤的高标准梯田。这不是物质刺激给我们的力量，也不是工分挂帅给我们的力量，而是毛泽东思想给了我们斗天天低头、斗地地高产的巨大力量。
    告诉你，孙冶方，你妄想复辟资本主义，那是南屋北炕——没门！我们贫下中农就是保卫社会主义的铜墙铁壁。我们要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把文化大革命进行到底，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神！
