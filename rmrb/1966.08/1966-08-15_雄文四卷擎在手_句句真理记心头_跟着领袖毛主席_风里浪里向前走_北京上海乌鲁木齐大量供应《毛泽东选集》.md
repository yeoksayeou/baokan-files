With four volumes of Chairman Mao's works in hand, every sentence is truth in the heart.
Following the great leader Chairman Mao, we march forward through wind and waves.
Beijing, Shanghai, Urumqi, and other places are supplying large quantities of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong."

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 14th, today, the Beijing Xinhua Bookstore distributed 160,000 copies of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" at its retail outlets. Revolutionary masses braved the rain to queue up and purchase Chairman Mao's works, each person beaming with joy. The bookstore was filled with shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" along with songs like "The East is Red" and "The Ship of the East Relying on the Helm."

The more than sixty retail outlets of the Beijing Xinhua Bookstore, spread across urban and suburban areas, were bustling with the sound of drums and firecrackers, creating a festive atmosphere. In front of many outlets, large red lanterns were hung, and big red "福" characters were pasted. Prominent banners read: "Strive to study Mao Zedong Thought, faithfully implement Mao Zedong Thought, enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and bravely defend Mao Zedong Thought."

After purchasing the newly published "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," many people were overjoyed and couldn't help but shout slogans, jump for joy, and express their boundless faith, admiration, and love for Mao Zedong Thought. At the Gongzhufen outlet, a worker led the crowd in shouting, "Read Chairman Mao's books! Listen to Chairman Mao's words! Act according to Chairman Mao's instructions!" At the Qianmen outlet, a soldier led the crowd in shouting, "Long live the great Mao Zedong Thought!" At the Xidan Commercial Center outlet, a student led the crowd in shouting, "Carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

A group of students from Beijing's No. 35 Middle School and No. 3 Middle School wrote in a letter to the bookstore: "We have been eagerly awaiting the 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong.' The Central Committee's wise decision to publish Chairman Mao's works in large quantities is like a spring thunder. We were overjoyed when we heard the news. Now, Chairman Mao's works have been quickly delivered to our hands! Let us shout: 'Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live our most beloved leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!'"

The Beijing Xinhua Bookstore plans to distribute 3 million copies of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" over the next two years, in batches to the masses. Today is the first batch distributed at the retail outlets. The staff said that distributing Chairman Mao's works and spreading Mao Zedong Thought is our fundamental task; we are honored and proud to undertake this task. They expressed their determination to turn the process of distributing Chairman Mao's works into a process of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The revolutionary staff of the bookstore will strive to overcome difficulties and quickly and effectively deliver Chairman Mao's works to the masses.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Shanghai on the 14th, today, Shanghai once again witnessed a moving scene of warmly celebrating the new victories of Mao Zedong Thought. Nearly 200,000 workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals purchased the long-awaited new edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." People were overjoyed and shouted from the bottom of their hearts, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!"

Today, the more than sixty retail outlets of the Shanghai Xinhua Bookstore were the most bustling places in the city. Inside and outside the stores, the crowd surged like a tide, and slogans and songs echoed continuously. An old worker, holding the new book with both hands, emotionally told the clerk, "Thank you. Thank you for the party sending us this treasure." A soldier of the People's Liberation Army, after receiving the new book, excitedly said, "The black gangsters want to block us workers, peasants, and soldiers from studying Chairman Mao's works, but they can't do it a thousand times, a million times! We will read Chairman Mao's books every day, use them every day, and pass down Mao Zedong Thought from generation to generation!" In the suburban Jiading County Xinhua Bookstore, more than 5,000 copies of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" were sold out in less than two hours. Many community members and cadres who bought the new books carefully wrapped them in red paper they had prepared in advance. They said with deep emotion: "Crops cannot grow without sunlight and rain, and farmers cannot live without Mao Zedong Thought. With Chairman Mao's works, we fear neither heaven nor earth, and we can defeat all ghosts and snakes! We dare to climb any peak!"

Today, the Shanghai Xinhua Bookstore also sent staff to Fudan University, Tongji University, East China Normal University, and Shanghai First Medical College, among other twenty universities, to supply the newly published "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." When the Xinhua Bookstore's decorated car loaded with "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" entered the gates of Fudan University and Tongji University, the revolutionary teachers and students enthusiastically welcomed it by holding up large portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao, waving colorful balls, beating drums, dancing the dragon dance, and singing the solemn and majestic song "The Ship of the East Relying on the Helm." They formed long lines to welcome the car.

The revolutionary teachers and students of these two universities held grand ceremonies to receive the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Maoyinjian, a third-year student in the Chinese Department of Fudan University, was so excited after receiving the new book that his heart could not calm down for a long time. He wrote a poem on the spot: "With four volumes of great works in hand, every sentence is truth in the heart, following the great leader Chairman Mao, we march forward through wind and waves!" Many revolutionary students of Tongji University gathered in groups of three or five to discuss the great power of Mao Zedong Thought. Lu Peiyi, the chairman of the Cultural Revolution Preparatory Committee of Tongji University and a fifth-year student, representing all the revolutionary teachers and students, swore to the party: "We will definitely, like Comrade Liu Yingjun, strive to study Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement Mao Zedong Thought, actively propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and bravely defend Mao Zedong Thought."

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Urumqi on the 14th, the Xinhua Bookstore of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Urumqi City today opened the supply of various editions of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." This supply is the largest in terms of quantity and the most complete in terms of editions in recent years. It includes five editions: hardcover, paperback, thread-bound, popular, and hardcover combined. The total number is 11,600 copies.

The people of all ethnic groups regard this publication of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" as a major event in their political life. People rushed to tell each other and competed to buy it. At the Mingyuan outlet, various ethnic workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals who came early in the morning to buy "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" shouted excitedly, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!" Those who bought "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" were overjoyed, cherishing the books while singing "The Ship of the East Relying on the Helm" loudly. Yuan Zhenming, a five-star worker from the Urumqi Coal Construction Company, held the newly bought combined edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and said excitedly, "In the future, I will definitely study Chairman Mao's works harder, master Mao Zedong Thought, and faithfully implement Chairman Mao's instructions in all my work. I will carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end."
