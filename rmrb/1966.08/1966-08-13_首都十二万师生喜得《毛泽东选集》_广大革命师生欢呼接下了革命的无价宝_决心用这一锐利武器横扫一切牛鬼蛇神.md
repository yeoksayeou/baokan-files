Today, nearly 120,000 revolutionary students and teachers from colleges and universities in the capital purchased the newly published first and third volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Upon receiving the new books, they rejoiced as if they had obtained a treasure, shouting "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" over and over again.

Today, the revolutionary students and teachers from forty institutions of higher learning in the capital, including Peking University, Tsinghua University, Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, Beijing Agricultural University, and Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, once again immersed themselves in boundless happiness. As the staff of the Xinhua Bookstore, under the golden sunlight, drove the mobile supply trucks loaded with Chairman Mao's works into the campuses of various universities, the revolutionary students and teachers, with tears of excitement, sang songs such as "The East is Red," "The Ship of the Great Sea Needs a Helmsman," and "I Love to Read Chairman Mao's Books." They continuously shouted "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!" They carried huge portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao, beat drums and gongs, set off firecrackers, and waved bouquets and wreaths, singing and dancing to express their boundless love and respect for Chairman Mao. They held the new editions of Chairman Mao's works, vowing to read Chairman Mao's books for life and to forever follow Chairman Mao through storms and waves.

When the Xinhua Bookstore's mobile supply truck arrived at the gate of Peking University, where the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was in full swing, tens of thousands of revolutionary students and teachers sang and danced, lining the streets to welcome the arrival. Cultural Bureau officials Xiao Wangdong, Shi Ximin, and Li Qi, as well as officials from the Beijing Municipal Cultural Bureau and the Xinhua Bookstore headquarters, were present today to participate in the grand ceremony held by the school to distribute "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Comrade Nie Yuanzi, on behalf of the revolutionary students and teachers of Peking University, said at the meeting, "At this moment, when we are fiercely attacking the anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought black gang of Lu Ping, Peng Peiyun, and others, we have obtained 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' and firmly grasped the sharp weapon of Mao Zedong Thought. We will definitely be able to defeat all enemies and smash all reactionary strongholds." Student representative Fang Yuzhen from the Department of International Politics said excitedly, "We have been longing for this day and night, even dreaming of buying a book by Chairman Mao. Today, our wish has finally come true. We will read Chairman Mao's books for life. We will shout 'Long live Chairman Mao!' a thousand times, ten thousand times." Representative Ma Wenyu from the Department of Chinese said, "Today we have obtained a priceless treasure, a revolutionary treasure. We love to read Chairman Mao's books, and so does the world's people."

Xiao Wangdong spoke at the meeting. He said, "The Cultural Bureau, Beijing Municipal Cultural Bureau, and Xinhua Bookstore have sent us the sharp weapon of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution—Chairman Mao's works. This is the first batch printed day and night after the Party Central Committee decided to publish a large number of Chairman Mao's works. This is the greatest concern of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao for the revolutionary masses.

Let us firmly grasp the invincible weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, and fiercely strike down the counter-revolutionary black gang, fighting them down, smashing them, and making them stink. I wish the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution at Peking University a complete victory!" Following this, Xiao Wangdong, Shi Ximin, Li Qi, and others went to the temporary bookstore to participate in the book-selling service work.

In these institutions of higher learning in the capital, the waves of joy continued from morning to night. Many revolutionary students and teachers, after receiving "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," did not even have time to eat and began to read intently in the campus, dormitories, and playgrounds. Some students, filled with passion, wrote poems: "Revolutionary helmsman Mao Zedong, four red books are the truth. Every word and sentence talks about revolution, generation after generation cannot leave." After receiving the new books, students and teachers from Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Chemical Technology, Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, and Beijing University of Technology also collectively went to the location of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to report the good news, expressing their determination to follow Chairman Mao and do revolution for life.

    新华社十二日讯　今天，首都有近十二万名大专学校的革命师生买到了新出版的《毛泽东选集》第一卷和第三卷。他们拿到新书以后，如获至宝，欢喜若狂，一次又一次地高呼“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”
    今天，北京大学、清华大学、北京钢铁学院、北京农业大学、北京航空学院等首都四十所高等院校的革命师生们，再一次沉浸在无限幸福之中。当新华书店的职工迎着金色的阳光把满载毛主席著作的流动供应彩车，徐徐驶进各大学的校园时，革命师生们含着激动的泪花，高唱《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》、《毛主席的书我最爱读》等歌曲，长时间地连续高呼“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”他们抬着伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像，敲锣打鼓，燃放爆竹，挥舞花束和花环，载歌载舞，表达他们对毛主席无限热爱、无限崇敬的心情。他们捧着崭新的毛主席著作，表示决心要读一辈子毛主席的书，永远跟着毛主席在大风大浪中前进。
    当新华书店售书的彩车来到正在轰轰烈烈开展无产阶级文化大革命的北京大学的校门口时，成千上万名革命师生载歌载舞，夹道欢迎。文化部的负责人萧望东、石西民、李琦等，以及北京市文化局、新华书店总店的负责人，今天都随车来到这里，参加了这个学校隆重举行的领发《毛泽东选集》的大会。聂元梓同志代表北大革命师生在会上说，正当我们向反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的黑帮陆平、彭珮云等猛烈开火的时候，我们有了《毛泽东选集》、牢牢地掌握了毛泽东思想这个锐利的武器，我们就一定能够战胜一切敌人，攻破一切反动堡垒。学生代表、国际政治系的房玉珍在会上激动地说，我们天天盼、日日盼，连晚上做梦也想到买一部毛主席的书。今天，我们的心愿终于实现了。我们要读一辈子毛主席的书，我们要高呼一千声毛主席万岁，一万声毛主席万岁。中文系代表马文玉说，今天我们得到了一件无价宝，这是革命的无价宝，毛主席的书我们最爱读，世界人民最爱读。
    萧望东在会上讲了话。他说，文化部、北京市文化局、新华书店今天派我们送来无产阶级文化大革命的锐利武器——毛主席著作，这是党中央决定大量出版毛主席著作以后第一批日夜赶印出来的，这是党中央、毛主席对革命群众的最大关怀。
　　让我们紧紧地掌握战无不胜的毛泽东思想武器，狠狠地打击反革命黑帮分子，把他们斗倒、斗垮、斗臭。祝北京大学无产阶级文化大革命获得彻底胜利！接着，萧望东、石西民、李琦等就来到临时售书站参加售书服务工作。
    在首都的这些高等学校里，欢腾的浪潮从清晨继续到深夜。许多革命师生拿到《毛泽东选集》以后，顾不得吃饭，就在校园里、宿舍里、操场上聚精会神地读起来。有的学生满怀激情，挥笔写下诗句：“革命舵手毛主席，四卷红书是真理。字字句句讲革命，世世代代不能离。”北京师范大学、北京化工学院、北京钢铁学院、北京工业大学等学校的师生领到新书后，还集体到中共中央所在地报喜，表示决心要跟着毛主席干一辈子革命。
