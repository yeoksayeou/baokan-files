The revolutionary masses of the capital, including workers, peasants, soldiers, intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres, have been boiling with enthusiasm and surging with emotion over the past few days. They have taken up their pens, sung songs, and danced to enthusiastically promote the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee and to joyfully praise the new great victories of Mao Zedong Thought.

In front of the reception center for the masses near the Party Central Committee, many congratulatory teams have come to perform artistic programs. People are singing, "The Party's kindness is greater than the heavens and the earth, and Chairman Mao is closer than parents." The cultural work team of the Guangzhou Military Region, the cultural troupe of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Beijing Folk Art Troupe, and the cultural troupe of the Political Department of the Engineering Corps of the People's Liberation Army have also come here to perform and promote the communiqué.

In factories, rural areas, military units, schools, and offices, activities to promote the communiqué of the Party Central Committee are being widely carried out. Many people, after listening to the broadcast and participating in the celebration activities, excitedly picked up their pens and wrote poems, quick-talking verses, couplets, and songs. Workers at the Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Mill were so engrossed that they didn't even have time to eat, writing until two in the morning. A poem by workers from the Beijing Wire Factory reads: "The Party Central Committee holds a meeting, boosting the morale of the revolutionary masses. Class struggle is never forgotten, and the Party's leadership is the first."

In the suburbs of Beijing, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Yongfeng Village Commune's Liu Village Brigade were so excited after hearing the communiqué on the radio on the afternoon of the 13th that their hearts were about to jump out of their chests. Poor peasant children Liu Liankui, Liu Fengming, and Tian Yuzhen listened to the broadcast five times in a row, recording the communiqué word for word, and enthusiastically created couplets and quick-talking verses overnight, such as "We Firmly Support the Communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee" and "Holding the Little Red Book, Our Hearts Are with the Communist Party."

The soldiers guarding Tiananmen Square wrote many poems within a day after the communiqué was broadcast. They sang, "A spring thunder roars in Beijing, the communiqué of the plenum spreads far and wide, every word and sentence is the truth, every character touches our hearts."

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 16th: In the past few days, the people of Shanghai have been widely promoting, seriously studying, and heatedly discussing the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee.

In workshops, docks, fields, barracks, and classrooms, people are studying the communiqué of the plenum over and over again and engaging in heated discussions. The young technicians of the Clock Room of the Shanghai Light Industry Research Institute, who successfully developed the Chinese-style frequency control standard clock, have studied the communiqué several times. They feel from their own experiences that it is Mao Zedong Thought that gave them courage, wisdom, and strength, enabling them to break free from foreign frameworks and forge their own path.

In the suburban rural areas, the broad masses of the people's communes unanimously acclaim: Under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, the people's communes are becoming stronger and stronger, the collective economy is becoming more consolidated, and agricultural production is developing rapidly. The party committee secretary of Hongqiao People's Commune in Shanghai County, Zhou Jianbang, said excitedly at a meeting: "In recent years, we have firmly remembered Chairman Mao's affectionate instructions, focusing on class struggle and the ideological revolution of the people, repeatedly repelling the onslaughts of demons and monsters against the people's communes, and making the people's communes even better and stronger!"

The revolutionary teachers and students of Shanghai's universities and colleges, who are charging forward in the great proletarian cultural revolution, are joyfully studying and discussing the communiqué with enthusiasm. They acclaim the communiqué as the signal for reforming the old educational system and as the compass for cultivating and training revolutionary successors of the proletariat.

　　宣传党的公报　歌颂毛泽东思想
    上海城乡人民结合亲身经历深入学习党的公报
    据新华社十六日讯  首都广大工农兵群众、革命知识分子和革命干部连日来热血沸腾，心潮澎湃，纷纷提起笔，唱起歌，跳起舞来，热情地宣传党的八届十一中全会公报，纵情地歌颂毛泽东思想新的伟大胜利。
    在党中央所在地的群众接待站前，许多贺喜队还带着文艺节目来演出。人们高唱“天大地大不如党的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲。”广州部队海上文化工作队、全国总工会文工团、北京曲艺团等文艺团体和人民解放军工程兵政治部文工团也到这里来宣传演出。
    在工厂、农村、部队、学校、机关，宣传党中央公报的活动也在广泛地开展。许多人听了广播，参加了庆祝活动回来，兴奋地提笔写下了一篇篇的诗歌、快板、对口词和歌曲。北京第一棉纺织厂有些职工连饭都顾不上吃，一直写到深夜两点。北京有线电厂工人的诗写道：“党中央，开会议，革命群众长士气，阶级斗争永不忘，党的领导是第一。”
    京郊永丰屯公社六里屯大队的贫下中农们十三日下午从广播中听到公报后，激动得心都快跳出来了。贫农子女刘连奎、柳凤鸣、田玉珍等连续听了五次广播，把公报一字一句记录下来，满腔热情地连夜进行创作，写出了群众喜闻乐见的对口词《我们坚决拥护党的八届十一中全会公报》，快板《手捧语录，心向共产党》。
    守卫在天安门前的解放军战士，公报广播后一天之内就写出了许多诗歌。他们歌唱：“北京一声春雷响，全会公报传四方，句句行行是真理，字字说到咱心上。”
    据新华社上海十六日电　上海市广大人民这几天以来，正在对党的八届十一中全会公报进行广泛的宣传，认真的学习，热烈的讨论。
    在车间、码头、田野、营房、教室里，人们一遍又一遍地学习着全会公报，展开了热烈的讨论。试制成中国式周波控制标准钟的上海轻工业研究所钟表室的青年技术人员把公报学了好几遍，他们从自己的经历中体会到，是毛泽东思想给了他们勇气、智慧和力量，使他们打破洋框框，闯出自己的道路。
    在郊区农村，广大人民公社社员同声欢呼：在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，人民公社越来越强大，集体经济越来越巩固，农业生产越来越发展。上海县虹桥公社连续七年获得农业稳定增产，基本上实现了农业生产机械化，这个公社党委书记周建邦在座谈会上激动地说：“这些年来，我们牢牢记住毛主席的亲切教导，大抓阶级斗争，大抓人的思想革命化，一次又一次地打退了妖魔鬼怪对人民公社的猖狂进攻，把人民公社办得更好，更强大了！”
    在无产阶级文化大革命浪潮中冲锋陷阵的上海大中学校革命师生，正怀着喜悦的心情热烈学习和讨论公报。他们欢呼公报是改革旧教育制度的进军号，是造就和培养无产阶级革命接班人的指南针。
