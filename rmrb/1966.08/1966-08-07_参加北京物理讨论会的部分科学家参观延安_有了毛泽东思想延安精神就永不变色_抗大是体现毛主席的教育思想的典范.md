Some scientists attending the 1966 summer physics discussion forum in Beijing visited Yan'an on August 5th. After their tour, they enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao using the most beautiful language. They said, "Mao Zedong Thought belongs to all revolutionary people of the world," "Yan'an is a holy land for the revolutionary people of the world," and "As long as we have Mao Zedong Thought, the Yan'an spirit will never fade."

Foreign friends visited the former residences of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Party on Phoenix Mountain, Yangjialing, Zaoyuan, Wangjiaping, and the Yan'an Revolutionary Memorial Hall. During their visit, they were deeply moved by every revolutionary activity of Chairman Mao. After visiting the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, a Latin American scientist, reflecting on the university's full embodiment of Chairman Mao's educational thoughts, linked it to Chairman Mao's recent proposal that all sectors should establish revolutionary schools that are both industrial and agricultural, both cultural and military. He sighed deeply, "I believe that Chairman Mao's guiding principle is a great innovation and contribution to the world, the only path to communism, and the fundamental measure to oppose and prevent revisionism."

The place where Chairman Mao had a conversation with American journalist Anna Louise Strong in Yangjialing in August 1946 attracted great interest from foreign friends. Everyone sat around the stone bench and table where Chairman Mao and Strong had sat, praising Chairman Mao's famous statement, "All reactionaries are paper tigers," as being extremely wise and correct.

These foreign friends arrived in Yan'an on August 4th. That evening, Tu Jinzhang, the deputy head of the Yan'an Prefectural Government, hosted a banquet for the guests. An Argentine scientist said at the banquet, "The Communist Party of China is a great party. It fights for the working class and has achieved revolutionary victory. No force in the world can destroy the Chinese revolution because it has the great Mao Zedong Thought."

The leader of the Congolese (Brazzaville) delegation, Emmanuel, said, "Why are the Chinese people so brave, so determined, and so steadfast in their struggle? This is because they have the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. We firmly believe that the Chinese people will achieve even greater victories. Long live the People's Republic of China!"

    参加北京物理讨论会的部分科学家参观延安
    有了毛泽东思想延安精神就永不变色
    抗大是体现毛主席的教育思想的典范
    据新华社延安六日电  出席北京科学讨论会一九六六年暑期物理讨论会的部分科学家五日在延安参观访问以后，都用最美好的语言热情地歌颂毛主席。他们说：“毛泽东思想是属于全世界革命人民的”，“延安是世界革命人民的圣地”，“只要有了毛泽东思想就一定能够保持延安精神永不变色”。
    外国朋友在延安参观了毛主席、党中央的旧居凤凰山麓、杨家岭、枣园、王家坪和延安革命纪念馆。他们在参观过程中，对毛主席每一桩革命活动都深受感动。一位拉丁美洲科学家参观抗日军政大学后，从抗大这所全面贯彻和体现毛主席教育思想的光辉典范，联系到毛主席最近提出的各行各业都要办成亦工亦农、亦文亦武的革命化大学校的思想，深有感慨地说：“我认为毛主席提出的这一纲领性的指示，在世界上是一个伟大的创举和贡献，是走向共产主义的唯一途径，是反对修正主义和防止修正主义的根本措施。”
    毛主席一九四六年八月在杨家岭和美国记者安娜·路易斯·斯特朗谈话的地方引起外国朋友极大的兴趣。大家围坐在毛主席和斯特朗谈话时坐过的石凳上、石桌旁，称颂毛主席在这次谈话中提出的“一切反动派都是纸老虎”的著名论断十分英明正确。
    这些外国朋友是在四日到达延安的。当天晚上，延安专员公署副专员土金璋设宴招待客人们。阿根廷科学家在宴会上说，中国共产党是一个伟大的党，她是为工人阶级而斗争，并取得了革命的胜利。世界上没有任何力量能够破坏中国革命，因为它有一个伟大的毛泽东思想。
    刚果（布）代表团团长埃曼纽埃尔说，中国人民在斗争中为什么能够有这样的勇敢，有这样的决心，有这样的坚定性，这是由于他们有中国共产党的领导，有毛泽东思想的指引。我们坚信中国人民将会取得更大的胜利，中华人民共和国万岁！
