Shanghai Mayor Cao Qiaoqiu and his wife Shi Bin held a banquet on the evening of the 17th to warmly welcome Pakistani Speaker Abdul Jabbar Khan and his wife, as well as the Pakistani parliamentary delegation led by him.

Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo and his wife Yu Ligeng attended the banquet.

The banquet was filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere. Cao Qiaoqiu and Abdul Jabbar Khan both spoke at the banquet. Cao Qiaoqiu said, the Pakistani people are hardworking, brave, and love freedom. During the period of resisting imperialism and fighting against Indian invaders' armed attacks, the Pakistani people have shown a high degree of patriotism and heroism. The people of Shanghai, like the people of the whole country, firmly support the just struggle of the Pakistani people to maintain national sovereignty and independence.

Abdul Jabbar Khan said in his speech, we have seen a cross-section of Shanghai's huge industry at the Shanghai Industrial Exhibition, which is indeed a proud and realistic exhibition that reflects the achievements of a resolute nation under strong leadership. Chairman Mao Zedong once said in 1949 that the Chinese people, who make up one-fourth of the world's population, have stood up. We have seen with our own eyes the reality contained in this historic declaration during our visit to China. The birth of New China is having an undeniable impact on international affairs. He said, our two countries have laid a solid foundation for mutual cooperation and friendship, and the scope of this cooperation is expanding.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 20th, Pakistani National Assembly Speaker Abdul Jabbar Khan and his wife, along with the Pakistani parliamentary delegation led by him, concluded their visit to Shanghai and arrived in Guangzhou by special plane this morning, accompanied by Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo and his wife Yu Ligeng.

On the morning of the 19th, the Pakistani guests visited the Shanghai Heavy Machinery Factory in Shanghai and watched the operation of a 12,000-ton hydraulic press. In the evening, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo and his wife Yu Ligeng held a banquet to warmly see off Abdul Jabbar Khan and his wife, as well as the Pakistani parliamentary delegation led by him. At the banquet filled with friendly atmosphere, Guo Moruo and Abdul Jabbar Khan toasted each other, wishing the friendship between the peoples of China and Pakistan to be further consolidated and developed.

The Pakistani guests arrived in Guangzhou at noon today and were warmly welcomed by Guangdong Deputy Governor Lin Liming and his wife Yu Jin, Guangdong Deputy Governor and Guangzhou Mayor Zeng Sheng and his wife Yuan Qinying, and Guangzhou Deputy Mayor Luo Peiyuan.

In the afternoon, the Pakistani guests, accompanied by Guo Moruo and his wife, Zeng Sheng and his wife, visited the famous scenic spot Baiyun Mountain in Guangzhou.

Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo and his wife Yu Ligeng attended the banquet. Lin Liming and Abdul Jabbar Khan both spoke at the banquet. Deputy Governor Lin Liming said, the people of Guangdong Province, like the people of the whole country, have always firmly and unshakably supported the Pakistani people's struggle to maintain national independence and justice, and firmly supported the struggle of the Kashmiri people for self-determination. He wished the friendship between the peoples of the two countries with a long tradition to develop further.

Abdul Jabbar Khan praised the great proletarian cultural revolution that is being carried out in our country. He said, wherever we go, we see the enthusiasm of your people participating in this historic movement. We understand how important this revolution is to your country and how profound its influence is. He wished them complete victory under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong. He thanked the Chinese people for their moral and material support to the Pakistani people when Pakistan was invaded last September.

He said, during our visit to China, we have seen with our own eyes how deep the friendship between the peoples of Pakistan and China is, and how satisfactory the cooperation between the two countries is. He said, words cannot express our sincere gratitude to your government and people. We will remember your friendship, remember the progress of your country, and the will of your people. We are convinced that you will achieve one victory after another in building a brilliant future.
