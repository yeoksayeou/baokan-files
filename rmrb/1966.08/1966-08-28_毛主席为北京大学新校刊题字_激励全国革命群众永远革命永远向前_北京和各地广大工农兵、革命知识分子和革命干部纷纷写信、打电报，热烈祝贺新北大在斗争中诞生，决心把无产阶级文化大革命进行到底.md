Chairman Mao inscribes for the new Peking University journal, inspiring the revolutionary masses across the nation to keep revolutionizing and moving forward. Workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres from Beijing and other regions have been sending letters and telegrams, enthusiastically congratulating the birth of the new Peking University in the midst of struggle, and vowing to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

A Xinhua News Agency report on the 27th stated that the joyous news of our great leader Chairman Mao inscribing for the new Peking University journal has greatly invigorated the revolutionary masses in the capital and across the country. They regard Chairman Mao's inscription as a manifestation of his boundless concern and immense encouragement for the hundreds of millions of soldiers in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution across the nation.

After the news spread, workers, peasants, and revolutionary students flocked to Peking University to offer congratulations, carrying portraits of Chairman Mao, waving red flags, and beating drums and gongs. They enthusiastically cheered for the birth of the "New Peking University" in the storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, shouting slogans such as "Long live Chairman Mao!", "Salute to the revolutionary leftists of Peking University!", and "Resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" They said, Chairman Mao's powerful inscription is a mobilization order and a call to arms for smashing the old world and creating a new one. It makes us forever invigorated and full of fighting spirit. It inspires us to keep revolutionizing and moving forward. Workers from the First Cleaning Vehicle Depot in Beijing, upon seeing Chairman Mao's personal inscription of "New Peking University" in the newspaper on the 24th, were overjoyed. Without taking their midday rest, they donned their work clothes, carried a large "double happiness" character and a letter of congratulations, and marched to Peking University to offer their congratulations. Peasants from Jinxing Village, Xianhe County, Hebei Province also traveled far to offer their congratulations. Workers from the Shijingshan Power Plant and Beijing Dancheng Brick Factory, who lined up to send congratulatory messages, expressed their strongest support for the revolutionary actions of the revolutionary teachers and students of Peking University. Two responsible persons from the "Red Guards News" of Lushun No. 1 Middle School (formerly Lushun No. 1 Middle School) in Liaoning Province, upon hearing the news, brought dozens of copies of the "Red Guards News" to exchange with the "New Peking University." They said they would spread the revolutionary seeds of the "New Peking University" throughout Lushun City. Many revolutionary students from various places who came to Beijing for revolutionary connections also extended their warmest congratulations to the revolutionary teachers and students of Peking University, celebrating together the rebirth of Peking University and cheering for the new victories of Mao Zedong Thought in Peking University.

In recent days, enthusiastic and warm letters and telegrams have been continuously sent from all over the country to Peking University. Six teachers from the half-work, half-study normal college in Tai'an, Shandong Province, wrote in their letter that the news of Chairman Mao inscribing for the "New Peking University" made them jump for joy. They recited the news aloud several times, and tears of excitement welled up in their eyes. A young worker from a poor peasant background at the Taiyuan Railway Wheel Factory wrote in his letter, enclosing stamps, and earnestly requested a copy of the inaugural issue of the "New Peking University" with Chairman Mao's inscription as a permanent keepsake. He said, Chairman Mao's inscription gave me boundless strength. I will definitely follow the Party and follow Chairman Mao for a lifetime of revolution. Many alumni of Peking University cheered for the rebirth of their alma mater. They said: "New Peking University" is a verdict, declaring the complete bankruptcy of the rule of a handful of ghosts and snakes and bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities" like Lu Ping and Peng Peiyun in Peking University; "New Peking University" is a manifesto, announcing that Peking University will become a brand-new socialist university armed with Mao Zedong Thought! The broad masses of workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres expressed high praise for the struggle of the revolutionary teachers and students of Peking University in the cultural revolution in their congratulatory letters and telegrams. They said, the revolutionary teachers and students of Peking University listen to Chairman Mao the most and were the first to lead the charge against the representatives of the bourgeoisie, setting an example for the nation. They vowed to learn from the revolutionary spirit of daring to venture, daring to act, daring to revolutionize, and daring to rebel of the revolutionary teachers and students of Peking University, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

Revolutionary teachers and students of Xinjiang University were extremely excited after obtaining the newspaper with Chairman Mao's inscription for the "New Peking University." Everyone passed it around, and the slogan "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" resounded. They excitedly said: This is the greatest honor for the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Peking University, and it is also the greatest honor for us revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Xinjiang University.
