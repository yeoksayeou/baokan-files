The vast number of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army are united in spirit with the millions of people at Tiananmen Square. Chairman Mao is our most brilliant leader and supreme commander. We resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to care about national affairs and shoulder the burden of the Cultural Revolution.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 18th, our great leader Chairman Mao, together with millions of revolutionary masses in the capital, celebrated the joyous news of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This news, broadcasted by the radio, instantly spread throughout the various units of the People's Liberation Army. The soldiers and officers were overjoyed and felt as if they were present at Tiananmen Square, their blood boiling with excitement. They eagerly said:

Dear Chairman Mao! You stood on the Tiananmen rostrum and celebrated the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution with the revolutionary masses. This is the greatest support, care, and encouragement for the revolutionary movement of hundreds of millions of people. It gives us the greatest strength to sweep away all ghosts and monsters, smash the old world, and build a new world!

Dear Chairman Mao! You are our greatest leader, the greatest commander, and the greatest helmsman! With your brilliant leadership, the ship of the Chinese revolution will definitely navigate through all the treacherous shoals and break through all the waves and surges. It will forever sail in the correct direction and reach the goal of communism!

This morning, in the various camps of the People's Liberation Army, at air force bases, naval docks, and high mountain outposts, the soldiers and officers gathered around the loudspeakers and radios, filled with joy, listening to the live broadcast of the celebration of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the capital. When the broadcast announced that our beloved leader Chairman Mao, dressed in military uniform and wearing a red cap insignia and badge, greeted the revolutionary masses on the Tiananmen rostrum and in the square, the soldiers and officers felt as if they had seen Chairman Mao with their own eyes. They felt a great warmth surge through their bodies, and they jumped up, shouting enthusiastically, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" When the broadcast announced that Chairman Mao, full of vigor and spirit, waved to the marching revolutionary masses, the soldiers and officers once again surged with excitement, shouting enthusiastically, "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!"

The soldiers and officers of a certain unit in the Communications Corps excitedly said that this morning, Chairman Mao came to Tiananmen Square at five o'clock to meet with the revolutionary masses and participate in the celebration of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This once again powerfully shows that the great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee believe in the masses the most, care for the masses the most, and support the revolutionary movement of the masses the most. Chairman Mao is always with the revolutionary masses and always has a heart connected to the revolutionary masses. National People's Congress representative and special merit awardee of a certain unit in the Wuhan Military Region, Zhao Maoshun, said with boundless excitement, "Chairman Mao meeting with the revolutionary masses again is the greatest care, encouragement, trust, and support for us. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings, care about national affairs, shoulder the burden of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, shoulder the burden of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, and forever follow the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to make revolution for life."

The soldiers and officers of the Fourth Company, who are stationed on a certain island in the frontline of Fujian and have collectively earned a first-class merit, listened to the live broadcast of the million-people rally. The soldiers excitedly held hands, danced around the radio, clapped, shouted, and sang. The island model soldier and excellent soldier, Jin Changyan, said: Today, not only the one hundred million revolutionary masses in the capital, but also the hundreds of millions of people across the country are celebrating the new high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution with Chairman Mao.

The news of Chairman Mao meeting with the revolutionary masses at Tiananmen Square was broadcasted on the radio to the rally of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution held by the Political Department of the Shenyang Military Region. The venue immediately surged with excitement. The slogan "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" echoed continuously. Songs like "The East Is Red" and "The Ship Sails on the Sea" were sung over and over again. Combat hero Zhao Zhonghua excitedly said, "Chairman Mao, dressed in military uniform, greeting the revolutionary masses on Tiananmen Square is a great event that shakes the world and has great historical significance. Chairman Mao is the greatest leader, the most brilliant commander, and the supreme commander of the revolutionary masses. Chairman Mao standing on Tiananmen Square is personally commanding us to declare war on the decaying old world and march towards the new world of communism. We must muster the courage to charge into battle and kill the enemy from the revolutionary wars of the past. We must closely follow Chairman Mao and, on the battlefield of the Cultural Revolution, sweep away all ghosts and monsters and achieve a thorough victory in the socialist revolution."

The soldiers and officers of the Air Force, Navy, and the military regions of Nanjing, Kunming, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Xinjiang, Tibet, and Inner Mongolia excitedly said with a firm spirit of victory, "Chairman Mao is our greatest leader, the greatest commander, and the greatest helmsman. With Chairman Mao's leadership, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will definitely achieve great victory." The platoon leader Li Naizhong and squad leader Yang Bingjun of a certain unit's Eighth Company, who collectively earned a special merit in the Battle of Triangle Hill, wrote a poem after listening to the broadcast: "Hundreds of millions of people sing together, with a heart of loyalty to the Party, following the leader Chairman Mao, creating a brilliant new world." They said, "We must muster the spirit of thorough revolution from the Battle of Triangle Hill and completely eliminate all ghosts and monsters."

Many soldiers and officers, after listening to the live broadcast, with boundless love, faith, and admiration for Mao Zedong Thought, unanimously expressed their determination to better launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Chen Mingliang, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works in a certain unit of the Jinan Military Region, firmly declared that he would, like the great communist warrior Liu Yingjun, dedicate his life to studying, implementing, propagating, and defending Mao Zedong Thought, and let the great Mao Zedong Thought spread throughout China and the world.
