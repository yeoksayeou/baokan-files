The capital held a grand rally today to warmly welcome friends from five continents who upheld the correct line and glorious traditions of the global movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs at the Tokyo Conference. The rally resolutely defended the fighting traditions of the global movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs, united in an international united front, and persisted in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. Vice Premier Chen Yi attended the rally, and Liu Ningyi, Nishizono Koji, and friends from various countries spoke at the event.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 12th, over 100,000 people from various sectors of the capital held a grand rally this afternoon to warmly welcome friends from five continents who upheld the correct line and glorious traditions of the global movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs at the Tokyo Conference.

The rally expressed that the 700 million Chinese people will unite with the people of all countries to raise high the banner of opposing U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression and war, the banner of opposing the capitulationism and splitism of the Soviet revisionist leadership, and the banner of supporting the national liberation struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Together, they will make new contributions to opposing U.S. imperialism's nuclear monopoly and nuclear blackmail, achieving a comprehensive ban and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, and defending world peace.

The friends came from Australia, Basutoland, Bechuanaland, Belgium, Brazil, Ceylon, Chile, Colombia, New Zealand, Panama, South West Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, and the United States. At the 12th World Conference to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, they upheld the correct line, resolutely fought against the betrayal of the movement's traditions and principles by certain leaders of the Japanese Conference to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and the Japanese delegation, who forced representatives of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, controlled by the Soviet modern revisionist leadership, into the conference. They withdrew from the conference. This just action was firmly supported by the people of various sectors in the capital today.

Members of the Chinese delegation who were obstructed and unable to participate in the Tokyo World Conference attended today's rally. The rally strongly protested the actions of the Sato government in Japan, which, in collusion with U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership, harbored hostility towards China and the Chinese people. The rally pointed out that the strong desire of the peoples of China and Japan to be friends for generations to come cannot be obstructed by any force.

The welcoming rally was held at the Great Hall of the People. A giant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao hung prominently in the center of the stage, flanked by ten red flags.

Vice Premier Chen Yi of the State Council, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the Chinese People's Association for Peace and Disarmament Guo Moruo, and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and head of the Chinese delegation to the 12th World Conference to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, Liu Ningyi, attended the rally.

The venue was filled with revolutionary fervor against imperialism. The crowd sang "The East Is Red" and "The Internationale," and recited Chairman Mao's quotations on unity against imperialism. The horizontal banner in the middle of the venue stood out brightly under the lights. The banner read: "Resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression and war!" "Resolutely support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation!" "Resolutely defend the glorious traditions of the global movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs!" "Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan!" "Long live the great unity of the peoples of the world!"

Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity and Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Association for Peace and Disarmament, delivered the opening speech at the rally. He said that the actions taken by the representatives from various countries at the Tokyo World Conference were completely just and in the interests of the Japanese people and the people of the world. They did the right thing and did it well. We fully support them and warmly congratulate them on their brilliant victory in this struggle.

Liao Chengzhi said that the erroneous practices of certain leaders of the Japanese Conference to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and the Japanese delegation in betraying the correct line of the global movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs are completely contrary to the will of the Japanese people and the will of the peoples of various countries who support the fighting traditions of the global movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs. The Japanese people and the enlightened people of various strata in Japan widely praise and support the just actions of the majority of foreign representatives. It can be said that if the leaders of the Japanese Conference to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and the Japanese delegation do not correct their errors and continue down this erroneous path, they will only be despised by the Japanese people and the people of the world.

Liu Ningyi spoke at the rally, warmly praising the friends from various countries for their principled struggle at this Tokyo World Conference. He said that the Chinese people greatly admire and firmly support your just actions.

Japanese peace activist Nishizono Koji spoke at the rally. He pointed out that the resolute struggle of friends from various countries to defend the glorious traditions of the global movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs is a strong support and encouragement to many Japanese people who are determined to defend this glorious tradition. He expressed his heartfelt thanks for this.

He condemned the reactionary, anti-China Sato government, which, in collusion with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, formed a notorious "holy alliance," unreasonably refused entry to Liu Ningyi, head of the Chinese delegation, obstructed the Chinese delegation's participation in the Tokyo Conference, and trampled on the will of the Japanese people who yearn for improved Sino-Japanese friendship. He said that we Japanese people must resolutely fight against this arrogant and unreasonable Sato government.

Nishizono Koji said that the Sato government's refusal to allow the Vietnamese delegation and the delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to participate in this World Conference exposed its intention to further follow U.S. imperialism and collaborate with U.S. imperialism to further participate in the aggression against Vietnam. We must thoroughly condemn this Sato government.

He said that the leaders of the Conference to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs have committed great crimes. They abandoned the principles established by the Conference to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs after twelve years of effort and the glorious traditions established by the World Conference to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs after eleven conferences. They were willing to dig their own graves. He said that this glorious tradition is a tradition of daring to struggle, a tradition of clearly recognizing that only by struggling against U.S. imperialism. Later, due to the collusion of Soviet revisionism with U.S. imperialism, becoming U.S. imperialism's running dog, and its sabotage and splitting of our movement, the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs has the tradition of regarding Soviet revisionism and its lackeys as enemies.

He stressed that as long as we are truly loyal to the struggle against atomic and hydrogen bombs, as long as we are fighting for a world without nuclear weapons and nuclear war, we must defend this tradition. This means that while we are struggling against U.S. imperialism, we must also resolutely and uncompromisingly struggle against Soviet revisionism.

He emphasized that although U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism do everything they can to obstruct China from having atomic and hydrogen bombs, the Chinese people, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, are advancing in great strides under the common slogan of self-reliance and have successfully conducted three nuclear tests. True revolutionary Japanese people are genuinely happy about this and express their congratulations. They are grateful and trust the policy that the Chinese government has repeatedly expounded after each successful test. The attitude of "China will never be the first to use nuclear weapons" is admirable. It is both a truly peaceful attitude and a firm attitude that is not afraid of enemy attacks and aggression. I believe that the initiative of the Chinese government to convene a summit of world leaders to ban the use of nuclear weapons is effective as a first step in completely negating nuclear weapons. It proves that China has active goodwill.

He said that the vast majority of the Japanese people regard China as a true bastion of peace and believe that only by strengthening friendship with the Chinese people and restoring diplomatic relations with China as soon as possible and establishing active cooperative relations can they drive the aggressors out of Asia and make a contribution to Asian peace. This is the fervent hope of the vast majority of the Japanese people. No matter who obstructs and sabotages, the feelings of the vast majority of the Japanese people will not waver.

Nishizono Koji finally said that many Japanese people have made up their minds to carry forward our traditions, struggle against U.S. imperialism, struggle against Soviet revisionism, and together with everyone else, resolutely struggle for a world without nuclear weapons and nuclear war, for a world of national liberation and true peace.

At the end of his speech, he shouted, "Long live the revolutionary unity of the peoples of the world!" "Long live the victory of Mao Zedong Thought and the Cultural Revolution!"

Following this, friends from fourteen countries and regions were invited to speak at the rally (detailed summaries of the speeches are on page five). They were William Morrow from Australia, Maphefiane from Basutoland, Jonni Sechele from Bechuanaland, Dupire from Belgium, A. M. Galhano from Brazil, Lakshman Mututantri from Ceylon, Jaime Barros from Chile, Ricardo Samper from Colombia, Nancy Whalan Goddard from New Zealand, Menendez from Panama, Kazonga from South West Africa, Kair from Sudan, Herbert Nkosi from Swaziland, and John Hawkins from the United States.

In their speeches, they unanimously pointed out that the withdrawal of representatives from sixteen countries and regions from this Tokyo Conference to uphold the glorious traditions of the global movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs demonstrated the firm will of the representatives from various countries to uphold anti-imperialist revolutionary principles, reflected the great unity of the peoples of the world against imperialism, and was of great historical significance. They pointed out that the current movement to defend world peace has become an inseparable part of the struggle for national liberation against imperialism led by the United States. To defend peace and achieve the lofty goal of a comprehensive ban and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, the peoples of the world must form the broadest and most genuine international anti-U.S. united front and resolutely struggle against U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and all their lackeys and followers.

The foreign friends also enthusiastically praised the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought in their speeches. Some friends shouted enthusiastically at the end of their speeches, "Long live the victory of Mao Zedong Thought throughout the world!"

The speeches by Liu Ningyi and friends from various countries at the rally were met with wave after wave of enthusiastic applause.

Later, Yang Qi, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, announced at the rally that the nine people's organizations in China that sponsored this rally, as in previous years, donated 100,000 yuan to the Japanese brothers and sisters who suffered from U.S. atomic and hydrogen bomb disasters in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Bikini, and expressed their sincere condolences.

Friends from Asia, Africa, Latin America, and other regions of the world who are in Beijing participated in the welcoming rally. Among them were: Z. B. Thant, Secretary-General of the Asian-African Journalists' Association, S. Senanayake, Secretary-General of the Permanent Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Writers' Conference, Sharma, Head of the Malayan National Liberation League's Delegation to China, Paron Chularat, Representative of the Thai Patriotic Front Abroad, Galib, Head of the Palestine Liberation Organization's Office in Beijing, Indonesian friend Willy, Lao friend Mrs. Kouning Bounsena, American friend Lee Dunbai, and some Japanese friends in Beijing.

Today's welcoming rally was jointly organized by the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Women's Federation, the All-China Youth Federation, the All-China Students' Federation, the China-Japan Friendship Association, the Chinese Red Cross Society, and the Chinese People's Relief Association. Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Qi Pengfei, as well as leaders from the organizing units and other relevant departments, attended the rally.

　　首都盛会欢迎在东京大会上坚持正确路线的各国朋友
　　坚决维护禁止原氢弹世界运动战斗传统
　　结成国际统一战线坚持同美帝苏修斗争
　　陈毅副总理出席，刘宁一、西园寺公一和各国朋友讲了话
    据新华社十二日讯　首都各界一万多人今天下午举行盛大集会，热烈欢迎维护禁止原子弹氢弹世界运动的正确路线和光荣传统的来自五大洲的各国朋友。
    大会表示，七亿中国人民将同世界各国人民团结在一起，高举反对美帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策的旗帜，高举反对苏联修正主义领导集团投降主义和分裂主义的旗帜，高举支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民民族解放斗争的旗帜，为反对美帝国主义的核垄断和核讹诈，为实现全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器，为保卫世界和平作出新的贡献。
    各国朋友来自澳大利亚、巴苏陀兰、贝专纳、比利时、巴西、锡兰、智利、哥伦比亚、新西兰、巴拿马、西南非洲、苏丹、斯威士兰和美国。他们在第十二届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会上，坚持正确路线，为反对日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会和日本代表团的某些领导人背弃运动的传统和原则，硬把苏联现代修正主义领导集团控制的世界民主青年联盟的代表塞进大会，进行了坚决的斗争，并且退出了大会。他们这种正义行动，在今天的大会上受到首都各界人民的坚决支持。
    因受阻挠未能参加东京世界大会的中国代表团成员，出席了今天的大会。大会对日本佐藤政府联合美帝国主义、苏联修正主义领导集团，敌视中国和仇视中国人民的行为，表示严重的抗议。大会指出，中日两国人民要世世代代友好下去的强烈愿望，是任何力量也阻挠不了的。
    欢迎大会在人民大会堂举行。主席台正中高悬伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像。画像两侧插着十面红旗。
    国务院副总理陈毅，人大常委会副委员长、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若，人大常委会副委员长、因受阻挠未能出席第十二届禁止原氢弹世界大会的中国代表团团长刘宁一等出席了大会。
    会场上充满团结反帝的革命豪情。人们高唱《东方红》、《全世界无产者联合起来》等歌曲，并且齐声朗诵毛主席有关团结反帝的语录。会场中间的横幅标语在灯光下显得格外醒目。横幅上写着“坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策！”“坚决支持越南人民抗美救国斗争！”“坚决维护禁止原子弹氢弹世界运动的光荣传统！”“中日两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！”“全世界人民大团结万岁！”
    中国亚非团结委员会主席、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席廖承志在大会上致开会词，他说，各国代表在东京世界大会上所采取的行动是完全正义的，是符合日本人民和全世界人民的利益的。他们做的对，做的好，我们完全支持他们，并热烈祝贺他们在这场斗争中取得的光辉的胜利。
    廖承志说，日本禁止原氢弹协议会和日本代表团某些领导人背弃禁止原氢弹世界运动正确路线的错误做法，是完全违背日本人民的意志的，也是违背支持禁止原子弹氢弹世界运动战斗传统的各国人民的意志的。日本人民和日本各阶层的有识之士，广泛赞扬和支持绝大多数外国代表的正义行动。可以断言，日本禁止原氢弹协议会和日本代表团某些领导人如不改正错误，继续沿着这条错误道路滑下去，就只能遭到日本人民的唾弃，遭到世界人民的唾弃。
    刘宁一在会上讲话（全文见第五版），热烈赞扬各国朋友在这次东京世界大会上所进行的坚持原则的斗争。他说，中国人民对你们的正义行动，表示极大的钦佩和坚决的支持。
    日本和平人士西园寺公一在会上讲话。他指出，这次各国朋友为维护禁止原子弹氢弹世界运动光荣传统而进行的坚决斗争，是对坚决保卫这个光荣传统的许多日本人民的强有力的支持和鼓励。他对此表示衷心的感谢。
    他谴责与美帝国主义和苏联修正主义结成臭名昭著的“神圣同盟”的、反动的、反华的佐藤政府，无理拒绝中国代表团刘宁一团长入境，阻挠中国代表团参加东京大会，蹂躏了渴望增进日中友好的日本人民的意志。他说，我们日本人民必须向这个蛮横无理的佐藤政府进行坚决斗争。
    西园寺公一说，佐藤政府不允许参加这次世界大会的越南代表团和越南南方民族解放阵线代表团兄弟们入境，就暴露了它加紧追随美帝国主义和与美帝国主义合作、进一步参与侵略越南的意图。我们要彻底地谴责这个佐藤政府。
    他说，禁止原氢弹协议会领导人犯了很大的罪行，他们抛弃了禁止原氢弹协议会经过十二年才制定出来的原则和禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会经过十一届大会逐步建立起来的光荣传统，不惜为他们自己挖掘了坟墓。他说，这个光荣传统就是敢于斗争的传统，就是明确地认识到只有同美帝国主义进行斗争。后来由于苏联修正主义同美帝国主义勾结起来，成为美帝的帮凶，而且它破坏和分裂我们的运动，因此禁止原氢弹运动有了把苏联修正主义及其娄罗们作为敌人的传统。
    他说，只要我们是真正忠实于禁止原子弹氢弹的斗争，只要我们是为了实现没有核武器和核战争的世界而坚持奋斗，我们就必须保卫这一传统。这也就是说，我们在同美帝国主义进行斗争的同时，必须同苏联修正主义进行坚决的、毫不妥协的斗争。
    他强调说，尽管美帝国主义和苏联修正主义千方百计地阻挠中国拥有原子弹氢弹，但是，中国人民在毛泽东主席的英明领导下，在自力更生的共同口号下，正在大踏步地前进，并成功地进行了三次核试验。真正革命的日本人民都为此由衷地感到高兴并表示祝贺。他们对中国政府每当试验成功之后都一再阐明的政策，表示感谢和信任。“中国绝不首先使用核武器”的态度是值得钦佩的。它既是真正热爱和平的态度，也是不怕敌人进攻和侵略的坚定的态度。我相信，中国政府提出的为禁止使用核武器而召开世界各国首脑会议的倡议，作为全面否定核武器的第一步来说是有效的，它证明了中国具有积极的诚意。
    他说，绝大多数的日本人民群众把中国看成真正的和平的堡垒，并且认为只有同中国人民加强友好，并尽早同中国恢复邦交、建立积极的合作关系，才能把侵略者从亚洲赶出去，才能对亚洲和平作出贡献。这是绝大多数日本人民群众的热烈的希望。不管任何人进行阻挠和破坏，绝大多数日本人民群众的这种心情是绝对不会动摇的。
    西园寺公一最后说，许多日本人民都下定决心，发扬我们的传统，同美帝国主义进行斗争，同苏联修正主义进行斗争，和大家一起坚决为争取实现没有核武器和没有核战争的世界，为争取民族解放和真正和平的世界而共同奋斗。
    他在结束讲话时高呼：“世界人民的革命团结万岁！”“毛泽东思想和文化大革命胜利万岁！”
    接着，十四个国家和地区的朋友先后应邀在会上讲话（讲话的详细摘要见第五版），他们是澳大利亚的威廉·莫罗，巴苏陀兰的马佩菲亚内，贝专纳的琼尼·塞切尔，比利时的杜皮尔，巴西的阿·米·加利亚努，锡兰的拉克森·穆图坦特里，智利的海梅·巴洛斯，哥伦比亚的里卡多·桑佩尔，新西兰的南希·惠兰·戈达德，巴拿马的梅嫩德斯，西南非洲的卡宗加，苏丹的凯尔，斯威士兰的赫伯特·恩科西，美国的约翰·霍金斯。
    他们在讲话中一致指出，十六个国家和地区的代表为了维护禁止原氢弹世界运动的光荣传统，退出这次东京大会，这一行动显示了各国代表坚持反帝革命原则的坚强意志，反映了世界各国人民的反帝大团结，是具有重大历史意义的。他们指出，当前保卫世界和平的运动，已成为全世界人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义，争取民族解放斗争的不可分割的组成部分。要保卫和平，实现全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器这一崇高目标，全世界人民必须结成最广泛，最真实的国际反美统一战线，同美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义以及它们的一切走狗和追随者，进行坚决的斗争。
    外国朋友们在讲话中还热烈赞颂伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想。有些朋友在结束讲话时热情高呼：“毛泽东思想在全世界胜利万岁！”
    刘宁一和各国朋友的讲话，在会上激起了一阵又一阵的热烈掌声。
    随后，中国和委会副主席杨骥在会上宣布，主办这次大会的中国九个人民团体，象往年一样，给在广岛、长崎、比基尼遭受美国原子弹氢弹灾害的日本兄弟姊妹，捐赠人民币十万元，并向他们表示亲切的慰问。
    在北京的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和世界其他地区的国家的友人，参加了欢迎大会。他们当中有：亚非新闻工作者协会总书记查禾多，亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克，马来亚民族解放同盟驻中国代表团团长沙尔玛，泰国爱国阵线驻国外代表帕荣·朱拉暖，巴勒斯坦解放组织驻北京办事处主任加尔布，印度尼西亚朋友威利，老挝朋友贵宁·奔舍那夫人，美国朋友李敦白，以及在北京的一些日本朋友。
    今天的欢迎大会，是由中国和委会、中国亚非团结委员会、中华全国总工会、全国妇联、全国青联、全国学联、中日友协、中国红十字会、中国人民救济总会联合举办的。我国外交部副部长姬鹏飞，以及大会主办单位和其他有关方面的负责人，出席了大会。
