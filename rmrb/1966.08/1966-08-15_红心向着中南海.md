	Thousands of mountains cheer and ten thousand rivers laugh,
	The communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee has been issued!
	The hearts of the people of all ethnic groups in the country bloom,
	Together they sing praises to the Party and Chairman Mao.
	The communiqué, riding on the spring breeze, reaches the workshop,
	In the workshop, the flames of revolution soar to the sky!
	Our hearts fly towards Zhongnanhai,
	Shouting long live the Party and Chairman Mao ten thousand times!
	The communiqué, every word and sentence, moves the heart,
	The Party's words sound more and more familiar.
	The communiqué, every word and sentence, is the truth,
	A new victory of Mao Zedong Thought!
	The communiqué, with red light shining in all directions, illuminates the universe,
	Guiding us to stride forward.
	The communiqué, like the sun, warms the heart,
	There are so many things to say to Chairman Mao—
	Holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought,
	We vow to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end!
	In socialist construction, we will bear the heavy burden,
	And ensure the Third Five-Year Plan is realized early!
	The method of being both a worker, peasant, intellectual, and soldier is good,
	We vow to turn the factory into a revolutionary university!
	In revolutionary struggles, we will brave the storms,
	And build our country to be strong and stronger!
	With Chairman Mao as our helmsman,
	We dare to walk paths that no one has walked before!
	The Party has given us boundless courage,
	We dare to scale peaks that no one has climbed before!
	Mao Zedong Thought illuminates our journey,
	What do we fear from countercurrents and reefs!
	Looking at the five continents, clouds and winds roll,
	Remembering the three billion people of the world.
	Looking to the future, we are full of confidence,
	Holding high the red flag, we vow to paint a grand picture for mankind.

　　红心向着中南海
　　北京第一机床厂　王恩宇
　　千山欢呼呵万水笑，
　　八届十一中全会公报公布了！
　　全国各族人民心花放，
　　齐声把党和毛主席歌唱。
　　公报呵驾着春风到车间，
　　车间里革命火焰冲九天！
　　红心呵向着中南海飞，
　　高呼党和毛主席万万岁！
　　公报呵字字句句动人心，
　　党的话越听越觉得亲。
　　公报呵字字句句是真理，
　　毛泽东思想的新胜利！
　　公报呵红光万道照宇宙，
　　指引我们阔步向前走。
　　公报呵如同太阳暖心窝，
　　多少话要向毛主席说——
　　高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，
　　誓把文化大革命进行到底！
　　社会主义建设中挑重担，
　　定让第三个五年计划早实现！
　　亦工亦农亦文亦武办法好，
　　誓把工厂办成革命化大学校！
　　在革命斗争中闯风浪，
　　把祖国建设得强又强！
　　有毛主席给我们当舵手，
　　前人未走过的路咱敢走！
　　党给了我们包天胆，
　　前人未攀的高峰咱敢攀！
　　毛泽东思想把航程照，
　　怕什么逆流和暗礁！
　　眼望五大洲呵风云滚，
　　牢记普天下三十亿人。
　　放眼未来我们信心足，
　　举红旗誓为人间画宏图。
