The Vietnamese Labor Party's central political theory journal, *Study*, published an article in its August issue titled "The Thought Work of Our Southern Military and People and the Victory of the 1965-1966 Dry Season" by Nguyen Chi Thanh, a member of the Vietnamese Labor Party's Politburo.

The article states that the remarkable victory achieved by the military and people of South Vietnam during this dry season is the result of the extensive revolutionary actions of 14 million southern compatriots who possess high consciousness, strict organization, and strict political discipline. These factors exist because the military and people of South Vietnam, under the guidance of the correct political line of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, are united in thought and action.

The article points out that in 1965, due to the failure of its "special warfare" in Vietnam, the U.S. imperialists took desperate measures and began to wage "limited warfare" in the South. Facing the large-scale deployment of U.S. troops to the South to rescue the puppet army and puppet government, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam promptly conducted extensive and in-depth political and ideological mobilization among the people and the liberation armed forces. This was done because the people of South Vietnam believe that without correct thought, there can be no correct action. Only with sharp ideological weapons can there be sharp steel weapons to defeat the enemy.

The article states that from this political and ideological mobilization, great power, vigorous revolutionary momentum, and calm, wise, and ingenious collective wisdom were generated, enabling the people and liberation armed forces of the South to achieve tremendous victories in the historic dry season campaign.

The article states that at that time, there were new situations that tested the ideological stance of the military and people of South Vietnam, such as Johnson's use of the carrot-and-stick policy, the continuous attacks by U.S. imperialism on the North, and the large-scale use of U.S. ground and air forces and other tactical weapons in the war of aggression in the South, etc. These aspects posed the task of re-examining the ideological stance and re-examining and analyzing issues related to their own political responsibilities, the balance of power, the use of revolutionary lines, revolutionary organizations, and political and military struggle policies, in order to first establish a firm stance. Only with a firm revolutionary stance can there be revolutionary courage, and thus resolute and creative revolutionary actions. In simple terms, to strike and defeat the enemy, one must first be bold and determined, and have sufficient perseverance.

The article states, "In early 1965, when the U.S. troops first entered the South, the National Liberation Front conducted regular and continuous ideological work among the people and the liberation armed forces, mastering the laws of ideological change. Therefore, the National Liberation Front proposed the correct direction for ideological work: implementing the revolutionary line, consolidating the firm and thorough revolutionary stance, concentrating on overcoming rightist conservative thoughts and the tendency to overestimate the enemy and underestimate oneself, strengthening unity, enhancing vigilance, and continuously fostering the determination to defeat the enemy and strive for victory."

The article states that the National Liberation Front affirms that the active aspects in the thoughts of the people and the liberation armed forces are the most fundamental and primary. Therefore, in the face of new provocations by the enemy, the National Liberation Front still has great trust in the daring spirit and creativity of the people, liberation armed forces, and cadres of the South. However, the National Liberation Front also believes that, on the other hand, it is necessary to prevent some possible incorrect ideological manifestations, such as inferiority complex, underestimating one's revolutionary strength, overestimating the enemy's strength, rightist conservative thoughts; fearing long-term arduous and cruel struggles; and stopping in one's tracks when revolutionary requirements must continue to advance and overcome all difficulties.

The article states, "Throughout the dry season, the National Liberation Front conducted excellent political and ideological work, which is a victory of great significance. It is precisely because of the victory in internal political and ideological work that the people and liberation armed forces of the South achieved great victories on the battlefield."

The article states that in the face of significant changes in the situation, the National Liberation Front promptly discovered and solved some new problems, avoided fluctuations, especially in ideology, avoided stagnation in strategy, tactics, and organization, and absolutely ensured the forward march of the people and liberation armed forces to continue fighting and defeating the enemy.

The article states that for easy remembrance, the National Liberation Front proposed a formula for lower-level cadres to grasp in order to do good political and ideological work. This formula is: firm revolutionary ideological stance and high determination + correct estimation of the balance of power between the two sides = victory. This victory must be concretely manifested on the battlefield, that is, to launch a high tide of military struggle, political struggle, and work to disintegrate the enemy's army, and achieved the most numerous, largest, and most outstanding results in the history of dry seasons.

The article states that our southern comrades have striven to apply historical materialism and dialectical materialism to implement the line of the National Liberation Front, to concretely analyze specific situations, and to solve problems that arise in the practice of revolutionary war. They have studied the situation seriously to transform it, guided the revolution forward, studied the line and proposals to implement them better, found favorable conditions to develop them, understood difficulties to actively overcome them, and understood the enemy's strengths to counter and weaken them.

The article states that the reason why the revolution in the South has such strong vitality is manifold, and one of the most important reasons is that the people of the South have the guidance of advanced theory. This theory correctly reflects the needs of social development and has become the compass for the South's military and people to advance. It is precisely because this theory is placed in the extremely high position it deserves and this theory's inspirational, organizational, and guiding power is thoroughly utilized, that the people of the South have already won victories. From our perspective, in estimating the balance of power between the enemy and ourselves, we see that the enemy does not have this power, but only we possess it. If anyone forgets this when estimating the balance of power between the two sides, he will lose a great power of his own, and thus all subsequent calculations will be wrong.

The article states that revolutionary leaders have all said: without revolutionary theory, there is no revolutionary movement. Once the advanced theory and political line of the vanguard class are grasped by the masses, they will become a great material force. Therefore, in revolutionary war, revolutionary theory and revolutionary line themselves contain great power, continuously providing the necessary material force for revolutionary war to defeat the opponent's material force. Therefore, if anyone does not estimate the balance of power between the enemy and ourselves in the South from this perspective, then first, he will shrink back; second, he will be confused when facing difficulties; third, he will mystify the victory of the revolution, unable to understand that this is the creative fighting achievement of the masses, and this fighting achievement originates from advanced theory, originates from the political line with invincible thought.

The article states that our military and people in the South have grasped the law of gradual and sudden changes in things and used it to estimate the balance of power between the enemy and ourselves in the South in 1965. At that time, they used dialectics to make the following analysis:

--- The enemy suffered defeat in "special warfare" and turned to limited warfare. Although the enemy increased its troops many times over, this is essentially a passive leap in the enemy's policy and strategy.

--- We defeated the enemy in "special warfare," which is essentially a leap in the revolution and people's war in the South, pushing our people's war to a higher state in terms of quantity and quality. Therefore, many new factors and new possibilities emerged, and we must firmly grasp, timely cultivate, and vigorously develop these new factors and possibilities to promote and develop the revolutionary war.

The article states that due to this viewpoint, our southern comrades drew the following conclusions at that time: the enemy indeed increased its troops in large numbers, but our strategic position is much better than before, the initiative on the battlefield is in our hands, our strength is much greater than before, and the enemy's strategic position is much weaker than before. Although the enemy's troops have increased a lot, most of them are used to fill the gaps left by the failure of "special warfare." The enemy's policy and strategy are in and will fall into serious contradictions, etc. Because the enemy does not have the conditions and basic elements to reverse the situation, while we have the conditions to maintain and further develop the initiative on the battlefield. We, and only we, have the conditions to continue to promote the change in the balance of power in our favor and to the enemy's disadvantage. Therefore, we have the conditions to smash the enemy's dry season counteroffensive. Due to the correct assessment of the balance of power, our southern comrades drew the correct practical conclusions and took good organizational measures to implement them, thus winning a brilliant victory.

The article lists specific facts to illustrate the essence of the U.S. imperialists' apparent ferocity but actual weakness, as well as the invincible might of the people's war of the southern military and people. The article states that in our South, why can nearly six U.S. divisions, plus a very powerful air force, not annihilate a single company of the liberation army in the entire dry season, while more than ten U.S. battalions were annihilated by the liberation army? This is why? If one only calculates the number of soldiers and guns of a U.S. division, one cannot correctly estimate its combat effectiveness. The actual combat effectiveness of an army is subject to many factors. In our South, the U.S. expeditionary force entered in a state of failure (although we do not underestimate it), and it is influenced and controlled by many negative factors, even making U.S. strategists unable to foresee the distance between the theoretical capabilities of these nearly six mobile divisions and their actual capabilities in the South during this dry season.

The article states that our comrades have used the dialectical view of contradictions to discover the enemy's contradictions, estimate their role on the battlefield, and deepen these contradictions, weakening the enemy. The U.S. military activities in the South have many contradictions, and these contradictions even dominate its strategy, tactics, and the organization and command of battles, making it extremely chaotic. The reasons for the chaos are twofold: first, it is already chaotic in itself, and second, its opponent, the military and people of the South, are constantly deepening its contradictions, making it increasingly chaotic. If one does not see these, one cannot understand why the U.S. and puppet forces, with 700,000 troops, were defeated by the military and people of the South in the dry season.

The article points out that the U.S. strategy is passive, being passive in three aspects: first, sending ground troops into the South battlefield, which is a point that the U.S. has always been most reluctant to do; second, the U.S. ground troops entered when the puppet army and puppet government under U.S. command had suffered a crushing defeat and paralysis, and the opponent was much stronger militarily and politically than before; third, once the U.S. ground troops entered, they tried every means to achieve a quick victory, but it did not work, so they had to extend the time.

The article states that the U.S. tactics also have many contradictions. For example, conducting ground warfare but relying on the air force to solve the war. To exert the power of the air force, clear positions and targets are needed, but here there are no positions, and the targets are scattered and hidden. Therefore, the theoretical role of the air force, if it has ten points, is only one point in actual combat. Relying on artillery and mechanized units, but infantry still have to undertake the task of assault. Relying on infantry, but the soldiers' morale is low, how can there be fierce assaults, tight encirclements, agile insertions, active pursuits, and quick and clean resolution of battles to annihilate the opponent? Etc.

The article states that the failure of the U.S. aggressors in the dry season is the result of a reactionary policy and a wrong strategy. The fate of the U.S. government's new colonialism in the South has long been determined by its essence.

The article states that in the end, the U.S. has recently failed, and we have won. In the future, the U.S. will fail again, and we will continue to win, which is not a strange thing.

The article states that our population is not very large, and our territory is not very vast, but our southern compatriots have already won against the U.S. in the first round and have absolute confidence in a thorough victory. Because we have the guidance of correct political and military lines, and a firm ideological stance and correct ideological methods, making our population seem twice as large, making our territory seem twice as vast, and making our revolutionary armed forces twice as strong.

The article concludes, "The enemy cannot overcome our people's resolute and thorough revolutionary stance, cannot overcome the heroic courage of our nation. We tell the American bandits and their lackeys with words and actions: you have no basic elements and conditions to win, you only have failure and complete failure."

    越南劳动党政治局委员阮志清总结南越军民旱季大捷经验
    有了正确思想和彻底革命的立场
    人人胆大志坚必能彻底战胜美帝
    新华社河内六日电  越南劳动党中央政治理论刊物《学习》杂志七月号发表了越南劳动党中央政治局委员阮志清写的题为《我国南方军民的思想工作和一九六五——一九六六年旱季胜利》的文章。
    文章说，我国南方军民在这次旱季中取得的显赫胜利，是有着高度自觉性、严密组织性和严明的政治纪律性的一千四百万南方同胞的广泛革命行动的结果。而所以具有这些因素，是因为越南南方军民在南方民族解放阵线正确政治路线的指导下，从思想上和行动上有着牢固的统一。
    文章指出，在一九六五年，美帝国主义由于侵略越南的“特种战争”失败，铤而走险，开始在南方打“局部战争”。面对着美帝国主义大规模向南方增兵来挽救伪军和伪政权，越南南方民族解放阵线及时地在人民和解放武装力量中进行广泛和深入的政治和思想动员。所以这样做，是因为我国南方人民认为，没有正确的思想，就不会有正确的行动。有锐利的思想武器，才会有锐利的钢铁武器来战胜敌人。
    文章说，从这次政治和思想动员中产生了伟大的力量、蓬勃的革命气势和沉着、英明和机智的集体智慧，使得南方人民和解放武装力量在历史性的旱季战役中取得极其巨大的胜利。
    文章说，当时，出现了考验我国南方军民的思想立场的一些新情况，如约翰逊玩弄大棒加胡萝卜政策，美帝国主义连续袭击北方。它把美国陆军、空军的力量和美国的其他战术武器大规模地使用于侵略南方的战争中，等等。这些方面给我国南方军民提出了必须重新检查思想立场的任务，并且必须重新提出和分析有关自己的政治责任，有关力量对比、运用革命路线、革命组织以及政治和军事斗争方针等问题，以便首先确立坚定的立场。有了坚定的革命立场才能有革命勇气，从而才能有坚决和创造性的革命行动。简单地说，要打击敌人和战胜敌人，首先胆要大，志要坚，毅力要足。
    文章说，“一九六五年初，当美军刚进入南方的时候，南方民族解放阵线就在人民和解放武装力量中进行经常性和连续的思想工作，掌握了思想变化的规律，因此，民族解放阵线提出了正确的思想工作方向：贯彻革命路线，巩固坚决和彻底革命的思想立场，集中克服右倾保守思想和过高估计敌人、过低估计自己的倾向，加强团结，提高警惕，不断培养决心战胜敌人的志气，争取胜利。”
    文章说，民族解放阵线肯定：人民和解放武装力量思想中的积极方面是最根本和主要的。因此，面临敌人的新挑衅，民族解放阵线仍然非常信赖南方人民、解放武装力量和干部的果敢精神和创造性。但是民族解放阵线同时认为：在另一方面必须防止可能产生的一些不正确思想表现，如自卑，过低估计自己的革命力量，过高的估计敌人的力量，右倾保守思想；害怕长期艰苦和残酷的斗争；在革命要求必须继续前进、克服一切艰苦向前进的时候，却停步不前。
    文章说，“在整个旱季，民族解放阵线很好地进行了政治和思想工作，这是具有十分重大意义的胜利。正因为在内部的政治和思想工作取得了胜利，南方人民和解放武装力量在战场上才取得了巨大胜利。”
    文章说，面临形势的重大变化，民族解放阵线就及时发现和解决了一些新的问题，避免了波动，尤其是在思想上的波动，避免了在战略战术和组织上的停滞，绝对地保证了人民和解放武装力量的勇往直前，继续战斗和战胜敌人。
    文章说，为了便于记忆，民族解放阵线提出了一个公式，让下级干部掌握，以做好政治和思想工作。这个公式是：坚定的革命思想立场和高度决心＋正确估计双方的力量对比＝胜利。这一胜利必须具体地体现在战场上，即掀起一个军事斗争、政治斗争和瓦解敌军工作的高潮，并取得了历来旱季中最多、最大和最出色的成绩。
    文章说，我们的南方兄弟努力运用了历史唯物主义和唯物辩证法来贯彻民族解放阵线的路线，来具体分析具体情况，找出了正确解决在革命战争的实践中产生的问题。他们以严肃的态度去研究形势，以便改造形势，引导革命前进。研究路线和主张，以便执行得更好。找出有利条件加以发挥。了解困难以便积极克服。了解敌人的长处来设法对付和削弱它。
    文章说，我国南方革命所以具有强大的生命力，原因很多，其中一个十分重要的原因是我国南方人民有了先进理论的指导。这个理论正确地反映了社会发展的需要，成为我国南方军民向前迈进的指南针。正由于把这一理论放在应有的极高的地位，并彻底运用这一理论的鼓舞、组织和指导的力量，所以南方人民已经赢得胜利。用我们的观点来估计敌我力量对比，我们看到，敌人没有这种力量而只有我们才拥有。如果我们中间有谁在估计双方力量对比时，忘却了这一点，他就丢掉了自己的一个巨大力量，因而使随后的各种计算题都将出错。
    文章说，革命导师们都说过：没有革命理论就没有革命运动。先进理论、先锋阶级的政治路线一旦为群众所掌握，就会变成巨大的物质力量。因此，在革命战争中，革命理论和革命路线自身就蕴藏着巨大的力量，不断地给革命战争提供必要的物质力量，以便打垮对方的物质力量。因此，如果有谁不以这个观点来估计在南方的敌我力量对比，那末，他一就会畏缩，二就会面临困难时感到徨惑，三就会把革命的胜利神秘化起来，无法理解这是人民群众富有创造性的战斗成绩，而这战斗成绩发源于先进的理论，发源于带有无敌的思想的政治路线。
    文章说，我们南方军民已经掌握了事物的渐变和突变的发展规律，并用它来估计一九六五年在南方的敌我力量对比。当时他们运用辩证法作出如下分析：
    ——敌人在“特种战争”中遭到失败，所以转到了局部战争，尽管敌人成倍地增加兵力，实质上这是敌人在政策和战略上的被动的飞跃发展。
    ——我们在“特种战争”中战胜了敌人，实质上这是南方革命和人民战争的一个飞跃发展，把我们的人民战争在数量上和质量上推向一个更高状态。因此，出现了许多新的因素和新的可能性，我们必须牢牢地掌握、及时地培植和大力地发掘这些新的因素和可能性，以便推动和发展革命战争。
    文章说，由于这种看法，南方兄弟们当时作出了如下的结论：敌人确实在大量增兵，但是我们的战略地位已比过去好得多了，战场上的主动权已操在我们手中，我们的力量已比过去强得多了，敌人的战略地位已比过去弱得多了。敌人兵力虽然增加很多，但是大部分得用来填补由于“特种战争”的失败所留下的空白点，敌人的政策和战略正在和即将陷入严重的矛盾，等等。由于敌人没有条件、没有基本要素来扭转形势，而我们却有条件保持和进一步发展战场上的主动权。我们，也只有我们才有条件继续促使力量对比发生有利于我们、不利于敌人的变化。因此，我们有条件粉碎敌人的旱季反攻。由于正确地考察了力量对比，我们的南方兄弟得出了正确的实践结论，并采取了很好的组织措施来加以实现，因而赢取了光辉的胜利。
    文章列举具体事实说明美帝国主义表面气势汹汹，实际上十分虚弱的本质，以及南方军民人民战争的无敌威力。文章说，在我国南方，为什么美国的近六个师，加上十分强大的空军，在整个旱季里也无法全歼解放军的一个连，反过来美军的十多个营却被解放军全歼了呢？这是为什么？假如只计算美军一个师的兵员和枪炮数量，就无法正确估计它的战斗力。一支军队的实际战斗力从属于许多要素。在我国南方，美国远征军是在失败的情况下闯进来的（尽管我们不轻视它），它受许多消极因素所影响和支配，甚至使美国战略家也无法预料这近六个机动师在理论上的能力，同它们在这旱季里在南方战场上的实际能力之间，竟有着这么遥远的距离。
    文章说，我们的弟兄已经运用辩证法的矛盾观点来发现敌人的矛盾，估计这些矛盾在战场上的作用，并加深这些矛盾，使敌人被削弱。美国在南方战场上的军事活动存有许多矛盾，这些矛盾甚至支配了它的战略战术和战斗的组织、指挥，使得它极其混乱。混乱的原因有两个：一是它本身就已经是够混乱的了，二是它的对方，即南方军民，又时刻在加深它的矛盾，使它日益混乱。假如没有看到这些，就无法懂得为什么美伪拥有七十万军队，而它却在旱季里败于南方军民。
    文章指出，美国的战略是被动的，在三个问题上被动：一是把陆军开入南方战场，这是美国历来最忌讳的一点；二是美国陆军是在由美国指挥的伪军伪政权已遭到惨败和瘫痪、而对方在军事上和政治上都比过去强大得多的时候闯进来的；三是美国陆军既开进来，就千方百计地求得速战速决，但是不行，因此又得延长。
    文章说，美国的战术也有许多矛盾。例如：进行地面战争却要依靠空军来解决战争。想发挥空军的威力就必须有明确的阵地和目标，而这里既没有阵地，目标又分散和隐蔽。因此空军在理论上的作用如有十分，在实际战斗中就仅剩下一分了。依靠炮兵和机械化部队，但步兵仍得承担冲击任务。依靠步兵，但士兵的斗志低落，这又怎样能够出现猛烈的冲锋、紧密的包围、敏捷的插入、积极的追击，以及迅速地干净地解决战斗，来消灭对方呢？等等。
    文章说，美国侵略者在旱季的失败是一个反动政策、一个错误战略的后果。美国政府在南方的新殖民主义的命运，早已由它的本质决定下来了。
    文章说，说到尽头，最近美国已失败，我们已胜利。今后美国将再失败，我们将继续胜利，这就不是奇怪的事情了。
    文章说，我国人口不很众多，我国国土不很广阔，然而我们南方同胞已在第一回合里战胜了美国，并且抱有彻底胜利的绝对信心。因为我们有着正确的政治路线和军事路线的指导，又有坚定的思想立场和正确的思想方法，使我国人口显得加倍众多，使我国国土显得加倍广阔，使我们的革命武装力量加倍壮大。
    文章最后说，“敌人无法敌得过我国人民坚决的彻底的革命立场，无法敌得过我们民族的英雄胆量。我们用语言和战斗向美国强盗及其走狗说：你们没有任何基本要素和条件足以取胜，你们有的只是失败和完全失败。”
