The golden sun of Mao Zedong Thought shines over New Tibet
Tibetan serfs celebrate receiving "Quotations from Chairman Mao"

	NEW XINHUA NEWS AGENCY LASA, August 12 — The Communist Party of China's Tibet Autonomous Region Committee recently distributed a batch of Tibetan-language versions of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to Tibetan serfs in various parts of Tibet. Tibetan serfs across the region regard this as a great joy for the million serfs who have risen up, and they enthusiastically shout, "The golden sun of Mao Zedong Thought shines over New Tibet!"

	On the morning of the 7th, in the square at the foot of Guding Mountain in the suburbs of Lhasa, a celebration was held to commemorate the distribution of the Tibetan-language version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Many Tibetan serfs, dressed in their finest clothes, beating drums and cymbals, holding high portraits of Chairman Mao, waving pure white khatas, and singing "The East Is Red" and "Socialism Is Good," came to attend the meeting.

	Zhang Jingyi, deputy secretary of the Dazi County Committee of the Communist Party, spoke at the meeting and distributed a batch of Tibetan-language versions of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to more than ten townships' grassroots cadres and activists who study Chairman Mao's works. At this time, the meeting erupted with loud slogans such as "The golden sun shines over the golden valley," "Mao Zedong Thought is the red sun in our hearts," and "Long live Chairman Mao!"

	After receiving "Quotations from Chairman Mao," the serfs who had risen up were extremely excited. They said, "Chairman Mao's book is the treasure that allows serfs to change the world and walk from victory to victory," "Chairman Mao's book is the golden key that can open a million locks," "If you don't eat tsampa, your stomach will be empty; if you don't study Chairman Mao's works, your mind will be empty," "After reading Chairman Mao's book, your heart will be bright, your eyes will be clear, and you will have a clear direction for revolution." Many serfs who received the Tibetan-language version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" wrapped them in pure white khatas, sat in groups of three or two, and read them carefully, word by word. The party branch secretary of Deqing Township, Ciren, who was born a serf, and the poor peasant from Xinzhou Township, Cairenquan, also shared their experiences and gains from studying Chairman Mao's works at the meeting.

	The Communist Party of China's Tibet Autonomous Region Committee, in order to meet the needs of the million serfs in Tibet who study Chairman Mao's works, recently distributed 28,000 Tibetan-language versions of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to various agricultural and pastoral areas, and another 100,000 Tibetan-language versions of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" are being transported from Beijing to Tibet.

　　毛泽东思想的金色太阳照耀新西藏
　　西藏翻身农牧民欢庆得到《毛主席语录》
    新华社拉萨十二日电　中共西藏自治区委员会最近把一批藏文版的《毛主席语录》发给西藏各地藏族翻身农牧民。西藏广大农牧民把这件事看作是百万翻身农奴的大喜事，他们热烈欢呼：“毛泽东思想的金色太阳照耀着新西藏！”
    七日早晨，在拉萨郊区达孜县古顶山下的广场上，举行庆祝藏文版《毛主席语录》颁发大会。许多藏族翻身农牧民穿着节日新装，打着锣鼓，高举毛主席像，挥舞着洁白的哈达，唱着《东方红》、《社会主义好》赶来参加大会。
    中共达孜县委副书记张景逸在会上讲话，并把一批藏文版《毛主席语录》发给十多个乡的基层干部和学习毛主席著作积极分子。这时会场上爆发出了“金色的太阳照到金色的河谷”、“毛泽东思想是我们心里的红太阳”和“毛主席万岁！”等响亮的口号声。
    翻身农奴们领到《毛主席语录》后无比激动。他们说：“毛主席的书是翻身农奴改天换地，从胜利走向胜利的法宝”、“毛主席的书是能开万把锁的金钥匙”、“不吃糌粑肚子空，不学毛主席的著作思想空”、“读了毛主席的书，心里亮，眼睛明，干革命才有明确的方向”。很多翻身农奴领到藏文版《毛主席语录》后，用洁白的哈达包着，三三两两坐在一起，一字一句地认真阅读。德庆乡农奴出身的党支部书记次成和新藏乡的贫苦农民才仁群觉，还在会上介绍了他们学习毛主席著作的体会和收获。
    中共西藏自治区委员会为了适应西藏百万翻身农奴学习毛主席著作的要求，最近已给各地农牧区发了两万八千册藏文版的《毛主席语录》，另外还有十多万册藏文版的《毛主席语录》正从北京运往西藏。
