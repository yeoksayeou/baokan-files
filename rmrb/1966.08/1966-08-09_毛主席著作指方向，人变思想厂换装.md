Sun Yefang is a thoroughgoing revisionist, of the same ilk as Deng Tuo and his ilk, directing the spearhead of their attacks on our Party and socialism at the great Mao Zedong Thought. He maliciously slanders Chairman Mao's works as "full of empty talk" and "the highest abstraction," shouting that studying Chairman Mao's works with questions in mind is studying with "colored glasses" and "frames." Sun Yefang wants us to engage in economic construction without relying on Mao Zedong Thought, to uproot our lifeline. This is truly "using a rushlight to pry up a stone slab," a futile effort!

I am fifty-seven years old this year. I was oppressed and exploited by capitalists for half my life, and I could not recognize more than a few big characters. After liberation, under the Party's cultivation and education and the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, I not only gained liberation in politics and economics but also stood up in culture. Over the past few years, by persistently studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, I have learned how to be a thorough revolutionary of the proletariat. I stand tall, see far, have keen eyes, and sharp senses. As the saying goes, without studying Chairman Mao's works, one walks blindly with open eyes; with studying Chairman Mao's works, one is old in age but young in spirit and full of vigor. With Mao Zedong Thought, the working class becomes the wisest, bravest, and strongest; without Mao Zedong Thought, we lose our soul.

A large amount of evidence proves that only by relying on Mao Zedong Thought can we run enterprises well.

Take our factory as an example. Our factory was established in 1924 by British imperialists. In the past, the factory's production equipment was broken, manual operations were numerous, labor intensity was high, and production efficiency was low. Since liberation, under the Party's wise leadership, workers have taken on the responsibility of masters to engage in production and construction, making production develop day by day and month by month. Especially through studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, workers have liberated their thoughts, dispelled superstitions, and carried forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to think and act. Focusing on production key points, they have carried out technological innovations and revolutions. Therefore, the entire factory has undergone earth-shaking changes. Now, more than seventy percent of the processes have shed heavy physical labor, achieving mechanization and semi-mechanization. As the saying goes, Chairman Mao's works point the way, people change their thoughts, and factories change their equipment.

Take the process of manufacturing China's first egg-beating machine and egg-grading machine, for example. Workers, in the absence of experts, materials, and equipment, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works with questions in mind, learned from Chairman Mao's works when encountering difficulties, solved difficulties with Chairman Mao's works, and did not forget Chairman Mao's works when achieving successes. Through repeated study of "On Practice," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," workers understood that the human factor comes first, carried forward the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat's hard bones, and after more than a hundred repeated experiments, finally achieved victory. These machines, compared to manual operations, have increased work efficiency many times over and greatly reduced labor intensity. How were these victories achieved? Not by relying on money or bonuses, but by relying on people's political awareness, the result of Mao Zedong Thought arming the working class's minds, which is the great victory of our studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

In summary, the working class, in the process of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, feels more and more deeply that one can eat less food and sleep less, but cannot study Chairman Mao's works less; one's head can be cut off and blood can flow, but Mao Zedong Thought cannot be abandoned. In this great proletarian cultural revolution, we must insist on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, grasp this political telescope and microscope, and open fire on all anti-Party and anti-socialist gangs. At the same time, we must strive to fully and over-fulfill production tasks, and achieve double victories in the cultural revolution and production.

    毛主席著作指方向，人变思想厂换装
    天津市第一食品加工厂老工人、学习毛主席著作积极分子　魏长庚
    孙冶方这个彻头彻尾的修正主义分子，跟邓拓之流是一路货色，把攻击我们党和社会主义的矛头首先指向伟大的毛泽东思想。他恶毒地污蔑毛主席著作是“空话连篇”、“最高的抽象”，叫嚷带着问题学习毛主席著作是带了“有色眼镜”和“框框”。孙冶方妄想使我们搞经济建设，不依靠毛泽东思想，挖掉我们的命根子。这真是“灯心草撬石板”，枉费心机！
    我今年五十七岁了，被资本家欺压和剥削了大半辈子，斗大的字认不了几个。解放后，在党的培养教育下，在毛泽东思想的哺育下，我不仅在政治上、经济上获得了解放，而且在文化上也翻了身。几年来，由于坚持了活学活用毛主席著作，懂得了怎样做一个无产阶级的彻底革命者，我就站得高，看得远，眼睛亮，嗅觉灵了。正是：不学毛主席著作，睁着眼睛走瞎路；学习毛主席著作，人老心红干劲足。有了毛泽东思想，工人阶级就变得最聪明、最勇敢、最坚强，离开了毛泽东思想，我们就没有了灵魂。
    大量事实证明，只有依靠毛泽东思想，才能办好企业。
    就拿我们工厂的情况来说吧。我们厂是一九二四年英帝国主义者开办的。过去，厂里生产设备坏，手工操作多，劳动强度大，生产效率低。解放以来，在党的英明领导下，工人们以主人翁的责任感搞生产建设，使生产日新月异地发展。尤其是通过活学活用毛主席著作，职工们解放思想，破除迷信，发扬了敢想敢干的革命精神，围绕着生产关键，大搞技术革新、技术革命。因此，全厂发生了翻天覆地的变化，如今已有百分之七十以上的工序脱离了笨重的体力劳动，实现了机械化、半机械化。正是：毛主席著作指方向，人变思想厂换装。
    再拿我们制造我国第一台打蛋机和除草照蛋机的过程来说吧。工人们在一没有专家、二没有资料、三没有设备的情况下，带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，遇到困难学毛主席著作，解决困难用毛主席著作，取得成绩不忘毛主席著作。通过反复地学习《实践论》、《为人民服务》和《愚公移山》等文章，工人们懂得了人的因素第一，发扬了无产阶级硬骨头的革命精神，经过了一百多次的反复试验，终于取得了胜利。这些机器比人工操作，成倍地提高了工作效率，同时大大地减轻了劳动强度。这些胜利怎么得来的呢？不是靠钞票、靠奖金，而是靠人的政治觉悟，是毛泽东思想武装了工人阶级头脑的结果，也就是我们活学活用毛主席著作的伟大胜利。
    总之，我们工人阶级在活学活用毛主席著作的过程中越来越深刻地感到，饭可以少吃，觉可以少睡，毛主席的书不可少读；头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不能丢。在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，我们一定要坚持活学活用毛主席著作，掌握好这个政治上的望远镜和显微镜，向一切反党反社会主义的黑帮开火，同时，力争全面完成和超额完成生产任务，夺得文化大革命和生产双胜利。
