Comrades and friends,

The emergency meeting of Asian and African writers held in Beijing, the heart of the great and strong Chinese people who have always wholeheartedly supported the national liberation movements of Asian and African countries and are now fully supporting our Vietnamese people in defeating the U.S. imperialist aggressors, has concluded successfully. The reports and resolutions made at the meeting regarding the situation in Vietnam, supporting our Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation, and condemning the heinous aggressive actions of U.S. imperialism have greatly encouraged the Vietnamese people.

Today, we gather in this heroic industrial city, in Shanghai, where the glorious Chinese Communist Party, which led the Chinese people to victory in the national democratic revolution 45 years ago and is now leading the entire people to build socialism and carry out the Cultural Revolution, was born.

The Asian and African Writers' Meeting issued a statement supporting Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to All Compatriots" and Chairman Liu Shaoqi's statement of July 22, 1966. This is a noble and highly valuable action. Allow me to seize this opportunity to express the profound gratitude of the Vietnamese people and Vietnamese literary and artistic workers to the Chinese people, the Chinese literary and artistic circles, the Chinese government, and the Chinese Communist Party led by the respected Chairman Mao Zedong, who enthusiastically assisted the meeting, provided the most favorable conditions for it in every way, and ensured its splendid success. Writers from the Asian and African regions, where the flames of revolutionary struggle are burning, have used their pens to sing the praises of and support the national liberation movements, to sing the praises of and extol the heroes fighting for the rights and happiness of the people. These writers have come to participate in the meeting and have used all their emotions to support our Vietnamese people's just struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation. For this, we express our thanks to them.

Comrades and friends,

At present, the people of North and South Vietnam are engaged in a life-and-death struggle with the U.S. imperialist aggressors. Of course, the victor in this struggle will undoubtedly be the Vietnamese people, and the shameful loser will be U.S. imperialism.

In the past few years, U.S. imperialism has sent 300,000 U.S. expeditionary troops to South Vietnam, implementing the "burn, kill, and destroy" policy without restraint. They have used napalm, phosphorus incendiary bombs, chemical poisons, poison gas, B-52 bombers, and various powerful weapons to kill the people of South Vietnam, attempting to subdue and force our people in the South to surrender and stop resisting. However, the heroic people of South Vietnam, under the leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, have resolutely resisted U.S. imperialism, inflicting defeat after defeat on it, both in the "special war" and in the "limited war."

The U.S. imperialism, which suffered a crushing defeat in South Vietnam, in order to extricate itself from its predicament, has taken advantage of its so-called "air superiority," deploying what it considers to be the most advanced and modern aircraft to bomb and strafe villages, hospitals, schools, water conservancy projects, and transportation routes in North Vietnam, implementing its policy of "gradual escalation." Recently, it has blatantly bombed the capital city of Hanoi and the city of Haiphong, an independent socialist state with sovereignty. Currently, it is crazily using its air force to intensify the war in various parts of North Vietnam. This bandit behavior of the Americans has been severely punished by our people in the North. By July 30, 1966, more than 1,260 U.S. bandit aircraft had been shot down in North Vietnam. While invading South Vietnam and bombing the North, U.S. imperialism has also been talking about "peace negotiations," trying to deceive the people. In fact, every time U.S. imperialism sings the tune of "peace," it is expanding the war and implementing its aggressive plots.

However, whether U.S. imperialism uses force or "peace" conspiracies, the result can only be its own heavy defeat. The Vietnamese people will never surrender. In response to the conspiracy activities of the Johnson clique and to express the iron will of the Vietnamese people, our beloved national leader, Chairman Ho, said in his "Letter to All Compatriots" on July 17, 1966: "Johnson and his lackeys must understand: they can send 500,000, 1,000,000, or even more troops to strengthen their aggression against South Vietnam. They can use thousands of aircraft to intensify their bombing of North Vietnam. However, they can never shake the iron will and determination of the heroic Vietnamese people to resist U.S. aggression and save the nation. 'The war can last five years, ten years, twenty years, or even longer. Hanoi, Haiphong, and other cities and enterprises may be destroyed, but the Vietnamese people will not be intimidated! Nothing is more precious than independence and freedom. When the day of victory comes, our people will rebuild our country, making it more magnificent and splendid!' Chairman Ho's words reflect the thoughts, feelings, and will of the 31 million Vietnamese people, expressing the Vietnamese people's consistent attitude towards U.S. imperialism. To liberate the South, defend the North, and unify the country, we are determined to fight to the end.

Comrades and friends,

In the struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation, the Vietnamese people have always understood that their struggle is not only for themselves but also to fulfill their international obligations to the peoples of various nations who are fighting against U.S. imperialism. In this just struggle, we have continuously received the ever-increasing sympathy and support of the peoples of the socialist countries, the oppressed and exploited peoples, and the peace-loving peoples of the world. I would like to seize this opportunity to ask you to convey the sincere gratitude of the Vietnamese people to the peoples of your countries and wish the peoples of Asian and African countries greater victories in their struggles against imperialism and old and new colonialism, in their struggles to achieve and maintain national independence.

Vietnam and China are two socialist countries that are closely linked. In the past, in the struggle against French colonialism, and in the current struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression, the Vietnamese people have always received the sincere sympathy and support of the Chinese people, the Chinese government, and the Chinese Communist Party led by the respected Chairman Mao. The fraternal Chinese people have provided spiritual and material support full of proletarian internationalism, which has made a great contribution to the victory of the Vietnamese people and is also a common victory for the two countries of Vietnam and China.

Since the U.S. imperialists bombed the suburbs of Hanoi and Haiphong, the Chinese government and the fraternal Chinese people have once again clearly expressed their determination to provide the most timely and effective support to the Vietnamese people.

The statement issued by the Chinese government on July 3, 1966, Chairman Liu Shaoqi's statement of July 22, 1966, Chairman Zhu De's telegram to Chairman Long Chen of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the statements of various people's organizations and democratic parties in China have all expressed the firm and consistent stance of the Chinese government and the Chinese people towards the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation. On July 22, 1966, a mass rally attended by one million people, including leaders of the Party and the state, was held in the capital, Beijing. In the border provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and in the major cities of Shanghai, Wuhan, Tianjin, Chengdu, Xi'an, Changchun, in factories, rural areas, schools, and border defense and naval forces, and in various parts of great China, large-scale rallies and parades in support of Vietnam and against U.S. aggression were held, attracting tens of millions of people to the streets to oppose U.S. imperialist aggression and to be ready to fight side by side with the Vietnamese people against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism. This is a great encouragement to the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese people, in their struggle, have always had the seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought as a strong backing and the vast land of China as a solid rear base. They are very proud of this. Relying on their own traditions and experiences of struggle, and with the full sympathy and support of their fraternal Chinese comrades, the Vietnamese people believe that their struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation will surely achieve victory. U.S. imperialism will surely fail.

Long live the unity and friendship of the peoples of Asian, African, and Latin American countries who are determined to fight to the end against imperialism led by U.S. imperialism!

Long live the unity of Asian and African writers who have contributed to the struggle against imperialist aggression!

Long live the unity and fighting friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China!

Long live the glorious Chinese Communist Party!

Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!

    在上海欢送亚非作家代表的群众大会上
    越南驻中国大使馆专员陈文献的讲话尊敬的同志们，朋友们：
    在一向全心全意支援亚非各国民族解放运动，并正在全力支援我们越南人民战胜美帝国主义侵略者的七亿伟大、坚强的中国人民的心脏——中华人民共和国的首都北京召开的支持越南人民抗美救国斗争的亚非作家紧急会议已经胜利结束。会议上所作的关于越南局势的报告，关于支持我们越南人民抗美救国斗争，谴责美帝国主义罪大恶极的侵略行动的决议是对越南人民的巨大鼓舞。
    今天，我们聚会在这个英雄的工业城市，在这个四十五年前诞生了领导中国人民胜利地进行民族民主革命，现在正领导着全国人民建设社会主义和进行文化大革命的光荣的中国共产党的地方——上海市。
    亚非作家会议发表的支持胡志明主席的《告全国同胞书》和刘少奇主席一九六六年七月二十二日的声明的声明再一次表示了亚非革命作家对越南人民的同情和支持。这是一个高尚的、非常宝贵的行动。请允许我借此机会向热情帮助会议，从各方面为会议提供最顺利的条件并使会议取得辉煌成就的中国人民、中国文艺界、中国政府和以敬爱的毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党表达越南人民和越南文艺工作者的深切谢意。正在燃烧着革命斗争烈火的亚非地区的作家，曾经用他们的笔来歌颂和支持民族解放运动，歌颂和赞扬为人民的权利和幸福而斗争的英雄人物，这些作家来参加会议，并用自己的全部感情来支持我们越南人民抗美救国的正义斗争，为此我们谨向他们表示感谢。
    朋友们，同志们：
    目前，我们越南南北方人民正同美帝国主义侵略者进行一场你死我活的斗争。当然，在这场斗争中胜利者必将是越南人民，可耻的失败者必将是美帝国主义。
    在过去这几年里，美帝国主义在越南南方出动了三十万名美国远征军，肆无忌惮地实行“烧光、杀光、毁光”政策，他们使用凝固汽油弹、磷燃烧弹、化学毒剂、毒气、B—52型飞机以及杀伤力很强的各类武器，杀害越南南方人民，妄图使我们南方人民屈服、投降，停止抵抗。但是，相反地，英雄的越南南方人民在越南南方民族解放阵线的领导下，坚决抵抗美帝国主义，使它遭到一个又一个失败，既在“特种战争”中失败，又在“局部战争”中遭到初步破产。
    在越南南方遭到惨败的美帝国主义，为了摆脱困境，便利用了所谓的“空中优势”，出动了它认为是最新式、最现代化的各种飞机，轰炸扫射越南北方的村庄、医院、学校、水利工程、交通道路，实现它的“逐步升级”政策。最近，它又明目张胆地轰炸一个独立的、有主权的社会主义国家的首都河内市和海防市。目前它正在越南北方各地，疯狂地用空军来加强战争。美国的这一强盗行为已被我们北方军民给以严厉的惩罚。截至一九六六年七月三十日，越南北方已击落一千二百六十多架美国强盗飞机。在侵略越南南方、轰炸北方的同时，美帝国主义又大谈“和平谈判”的陈词滥调，企图欺骗人民。事实上，每当美帝国主义高唱“和平”论调时，便是它又一次扩大战争，实现侵略阴谋的时候。
    但是，不管美帝国主义采取武力手段，还是“和谈”阴谋，结果都只能使它遭到惨重的失败，我们越南人民是绝对不会屈服的。为了回答约翰逊集团的阴谋活动，表达越南人民的钢铁意志，我们越南民族敬爱的领袖胡主席在一九六六年七月十七日《告全国同胞书》中说：“约翰逊和他的走狗必须懂得：他们可以出动五十万、一百万或者更多的军队来加强对越南南方的侵略战争。他们可以使用成千架飞机来加强对越南北方的轰炸。但是，他们绝不能动摇英雄的越南人民抗美救国的钢铁意志和决心。”“战争可以延长五年、十年、二十年或者更长的时间，河内、海防和其他一些城市、企业可能被摧毁，但是越南人民是不会被吓倒的！没有什么能比独立、自由更为宝贵的了。在胜利的日子到来的时候，我国人民将重新把自己的祖国建设得更加堂皇，更加壮丽！”胡主席的话体现了我们三千一百万越南人民的思想感情和意志，表达了越南人民对美帝国主义的一贯态度。为了解放南方，保卫北方，统一祖国，我们决心战斗到底。
    同志们，朋友们：
    在抗美救国斗争中，越南人民一向懂得，他们战斗不仅是为了他们自己，而且也是履行自己对正在同美帝国主义进行斗争的各民族应尽的国际义务。在这场正义的战斗中，我们不断得到社会主义各国的人民、各被压迫和被剥削民族的人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民所给予的日益巨大的同情和支持。我愿意借此机会，请各位把我们越南人民的真诚谢意转达你们国家的人民，并祝亚非各国人民在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义，争取和维护民族独立的斗争事业中取得更大的胜利。
    越南和中国是两个唇齿相依的社会主义国家。在过去抵抗法国殖民主义者的斗争中，以及在当前抵抗美帝国主义侵略的斗争中，越南人民一向得到中国人民、中国政府和以敬爱的毛主席为首的中国共产党给以真诚的同情和支持。兄弟般的中国人民给予的充满着无产阶级国际主义的精神和物质支援对我们越南人民的胜利，同时也是越中两国的共同胜利，作出了巨大的贡献。
    自从美帝国主义轰炸河内和海防郊区以来，中国政府和兄弟的中国人民又一次清楚地表示要最及时地、最有效地支援越南人民的决心。
    中国政府于一九六六年七月三日发表的声明，刘少奇主席一九六六年七月二十二日的声明、朱德委员长拍给越南民主共和国国会常务委员会主席长征的电报以及中国各人民团体和民主党派的声明，都表达了中国政府和中国人民对越南人民的抗美救国事业所采取的坚定的和始终如一的立场。一九六六年七月二十二日在首都北京举行了有中国的党和国家的领导成员出席并有一百万人参加的群众大会，在越中边境的广东、广西、云南等省（区），在上海、武汉、天津、成都、西安、长春等大城市，在工厂、农村、学校和边防、海防部队中，在伟大的中国各地举行了援越抗美的声势浩大的集会和游行，这些活动吸引了亿万人民涌向街头，反对美帝国主义侵略，随时准备同越南人民一起，并肩作战，反对共同敌人美帝国主义，这是对越南人民的一种非常巨大的鼓舞。越南人民，在战斗中一向有毛泽东思想武装起来的兄弟般的七亿中国人民作为强大的后盾，有中国广阔的土地作为坚强的后方，他们对此感到非常自豪。凭着自己的斗争传统和经验，又有兄弟般的中国的充分的同情和支持，越南人民相信，他们的抗美救国斗争必将取得胜利。美帝国主义必将失败。
    为反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义而坚决斗争到底的亚非拉各国人民的团结和友谊万岁！
    为反对帝国主义侵略的斗争作出贡献的亚非作家的团结万岁！
    越中两国人民的团结和战斗友谊万岁！
    光荣的中国共产党万岁！
    毛泽东主席万岁！
