Class Struggle Exists Inside and Outside the Counter

Li Keqin, Deputy Political Instructor of the Daily Necessities Department, Tianjin Efficient Business Market

Sun Yefang proposed the fallacy that "economics is a unified contradiction of 'people' and 'things'" to make us not engage in class struggle, focus on business, and not concern ourselves with politics. Specifically, in our commercial sector, standing at the counter every day and selling goods, is this just a relationship between people and things? No! Our socialist commerce is not just about people and things; it is not simply about buying and selling, organizing goods to come in and go out. Instead, it is about standing at the counter for the revolution, doing business for the revolution, serving production, serving the people's lives, and serving proletarian politics. The work of our salespeople must be led by politics and must be guided by class struggle. Even selling a few cents' worth of small items has political significance. One day, a customer came to get buttons, and we helped him choose smooth buttons and paid attention to whether the buttonholes were straight. We also proactively told him to sew on a few more stitches. The customer, holding a few cents' worth of buttons, said with class feelings, "Before liberation, whenever I came to Efficient Business Market, I got cheated every time. This time, I bought a few cents' worth of buttons, and you thought of everything so carefully. This is a good socialist store under the leadership of the Communist Party, and a good salesperson educated by Chairman Mao." The customer was right. We were not thinking about a few cents; we were thinking about how to serve socialist construction well. The customer was thinking about the Party, Chairman Mao, socialism, and the contrast between the old and new societies. Is this just a relationship between people and things? Absolutely not.

Since Efficient Business Market was jointly operated by the public and private sectors in 1956, we have become the masters of the enterprise. Even so, we cannot focus solely on business because class struggle still exists. Unreformed bourgeois elements, unwilling to accept the demise of their class, seize every opportunity to spread bourgeois ideology to the youth, saying things like "money can make the devil push the millstone" and "work hard, and you will get a higher wage evaluation in the future," and so on. Their goal is to delude the youth into leaving proletarian politics, confusing friend and foe, and falling into the quagmire of individualism. However, the youth of New China, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, cannot be deceived. We know that in the old society, why the poor could not eat or dress warmly, and why the rich had "abundant wealth" and "daily profits," was all due to class oppression and exploitation. The enterprise has been jointly operated, and on the surface, bourgeois elements work with us, eat with us, but the exploiting class still exists, and unreformed bourgeois elements always want to restore capitalism. We must firmly grasp the weapon of Mao Zedong Thought and the weapon of class struggle. Whether standing at the counter or making machines, we must do so. Otherwise, the country will change color, and the dictatorship of the proletariat will collapse.

Since liberation, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie has never stopped. Does Sun Yefang not see these facts? No! His eyes are wide open; he wishes to see China change color and the dictatorship of the proletariat collapse. Does he not understand class struggle? No, he understands class struggle very well. He advocates for the "contradiction between people and things," telling us to focus on business and not concern ourselves with politics, precisely to facilitate a "peaceful evolution." Sun Yefang does not allow us to engage in class struggle, precisely so that he and his small group of counter-revolutionaries can engage in class struggle and restore capitalism. Let me tell you, Sun Yefang, this will never happen!

    柜台里外也有阶级斗争
    天津市劝业商场日用百货部副政治指导员　李克勤
    孙冶方提出“经济是‘人’与‘物’两个因素的矛盾统一体”的谬论，就是要我们不搞阶级斗争，埋头业务，不问政治。具体到我们商业部门，每天站柜台，卖商品，是人和物的关系吗？不！我们社会主义商业不仅是人和物的关系，不是单纯做买卖，把商品组织进来、卖出去就完了，而是为革命站柜台，为革命做生意，为生产服务，为人民生活服务，为无产阶级政治服务。我们售货员的工作一定要政治挂帅，一定要以阶级斗争为纲。就是卖几分钱的小商品，也有政治意义。有一天一个顾客来配扣子，我们帮他挑选了四周圆滑的扣子，还注意扣眼正不正，并主动告诉他要多缝上几针。顾客拿到几分钱的扣子，充满阶级感情地说：“解放前我到劝业场来，来一次上一次当。这次我买几分钱的扣子，你们想的那么周到，这是共产党领导下的社会主义好商店，是毛主席教育下的好售货员。”顾客说得很对，我们想的不是几分钱的问题，而是怎样为社会主义建设服务好。顾客想的是党，是毛主席，是社会主义，是新旧社会的对比。这难道仅是人和物的关系吗？根本不是。
    劝业商场从一九五六年公私合营以后，我们当了企业的主人。虽然这样，我们也不能埋头业务，因为还存在着阶级斗争。没有改造好的资产阶级分子，不甘心自己阶级的灭亡，一有机会就向青年宣扬资产阶级思想，说什么“有钱能使鬼推磨”，“好好地干，将来评定工资能多长些钱”，等等。他们的目的是妄想使青年脱离无产阶级政治，不分敌我，陷到个人主义的泥坑里。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的新中国青年是骗不了的。我们知道，旧社会穷人为什么吃不饱、穿不暖，富人为什么“财源茂盛”、“日进斗金”，这还不都是阶级压迫和阶级剥削造成的吗？企业合营了，从表面上看，资产阶级分子和我们一样劳动，一起吃饭，但是剥削阶级还存在，未改造好的资产阶级分子时时想搞资本主义复辟。我们必须紧紧掌握毛泽东思想的武器，掌握阶级斗争的武器，不管站柜台也好，造机器也好，都应该这样，不然，国家就要变颜色，无产阶级专政就要垮台。
    解放以来，无产阶级同资产阶级的斗争，从来没有停止过。难道孙冶方看不见这些事实吗？不！他的眼瞪得很大，他妄想看到中国变色，看到无产阶级专政垮台。他不懂得阶级斗争吗？不，他很懂得阶级斗争，他宣扬“人和物的矛盾”，叫我们埋头业务，不问政治，目的就是想搞“和平演变”。孙冶方不让我们搞阶级斗争，正是为了好让他们这一小撮反革命分子搞阶级斗争，搞资本主义复辟。告诉你，孙冶方，这是永世办不到的！
