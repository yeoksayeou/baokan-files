Title: Do Not Defame Our Class Brothers

After watching the film "Two Families," I am filled with indignation. I cannot help but loudly ask the film's directors and writers: What position are you taking? Whose side are you on? Whom do you support and whom do you oppose?

Chairman Mao has long taught us: "Without poor peasants, there would be no revolution. To deny them is to deny the revolution. To attack them is to attack the revolution." Only the reactionary ruling class and all counterrevolutionary elements regard poor peasants as thorns in their eyes and flesh in their bones, attacking and defaming them at will. The directors and writers of "Two Families" are just like this. They maliciously and with ulterior motives distort historical facts and defame the image of poor peasants. The directors and writers portray the film's protagonist, the old poor peasant Gao Zhengguo, as someone who resolutely wants to take the capitalist road; as a miser, someone who only cares about personal enrichment and ignores national interests; as someone described like a landlord—making neighboring poor and lower-middle peasants all carry grain to his house to repay debts. All of this is a deliberate reversal of right and wrong. Directors and writers, what are your intentions? Why do you want to distort the image of poor peasants? Why do you want to defame poor and lower-middle peasants? As a worker, I absolutely do not allow you to harm even a hair of our class brothers—the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants!

    不许污蔑我们的阶级兄弟
    北京联合制版厂工人　华有益
    看了电影《两家人》以后，愤怒万分。我不禁要大声问一下电影的编导者，你们是站在什么立场上讲话？替谁说话？拥护谁，反对谁？
    毛主席早就教导我们：“没有贫农，便没有革命。若否认他们，便是否认革命。若打击他们，便是打击革命。”只有反动统治阶级和一切反革命分子，才把贫农看成眼中钉，肉中刺，恣意打击和污蔑贫农。《两家人》的编导者就是这样。他们十分恶毒地、别有用心地歪曲历史事实、丑化贫农的形象。编导者把电影中的主人公老贫农高正国说成是一个坚决要走资本主义道路的人；把他说成是一个财迷，是一个只顾个人发财致富、而不顾国家利益的人；把他描写得象地主分子一样——让四邻的贫下中农都肩扛着粮食到他家来还债……。这一切，完全是有意地颠倒是非。影片的编导者，你们居心何在？你们为什么要歪曲贫农的形象？为什么要污蔑贫下中农？作为一个工人，我决不允许你们损害我们阶级兄弟——广大贫下中农的一根毫毛！
