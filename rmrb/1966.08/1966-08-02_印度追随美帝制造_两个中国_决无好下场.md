The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China strongly protests the Indian government's collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek clique and interference in China's internal affairs. India's following of US imperialism in creating "Two Chinas" will have no good outcome.

The Chinese government firmly opposes anyone, at any time and in any place, plotting any form of "Two Chinas." The Indian government, while maintaining diplomatic relations with China, has allowed Chiang Kai-shek clique members to openly engage in anti-China activities in India. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese government.

New China News Agency, August 1: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China sent a note on July 28 to the Indian Embassy in China, refuting the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note of May 13, which justified the Indian government's conspiracy to follow US imperialism in creating "Two Chinas" and collude with the Chiang Kai-shek clique in anti-China activities. The note also lodged a strong protest with the Indian government.

The note pointed out that the Indian side's note itself is another major exposure of its conspiracy. The note said: "The note repeatedly refers to the bandits occupying Taiwan Province of China as the 'Formosa delegation' and 'Taiwan representatives,' and openly refers to Taiwan as a 'member state' of some international organization. This is obviously an interference in China's sovereignty and internal affairs, a blatant attempt to create 'One China, One Taiwan,' and to legalize the situation where the Chiang Kai-shek clique illegally occupies China's seat in the United Nations and other international organizations. According to reports, in March this year, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, during her visit to the United States, publicly advocated the fallacy of 'Taiwan's status pending determination' and 'One China, One Taiwan.' The Indian side's dissemination of these fallacies is serving the US imperialist conspiracy of 'Two Chinas' or 'One China, One Taiwan,' aiming to separate Taiwan from China and legalize the long-term US occupation of Taiwan. The Chinese government strongly protests this to the Indian government and reiterates: Taiwan is an inseparable part of China's sacred territory, and China's sovereignty over Taiwan will not be allowed to be interfered with by outsiders. The Chinese government firmly opposes anyone, at any time and in any place, plotting any form of 'Two Chinas.'"

The note pointed out that the Indian side's note cannot deny the facts listed in the Chinese government's notes of November 6, 1965, and April 2, 1966, of the Indian government's collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek clique and gross interference in China's internal affairs.

The note listed the Indian government's efforts to use international conferences to promote the "Two Chinas" conspiracy, allowing Chiang Kai-shek clique members to openly engage in anti-China activities in India; the Indian President, Congress Party Chairman, and Minister of Railways, among other high-level leaders, meeting with Chiang Kai-shek clique members and asking them to convey greetings to China's public enemy Chiang Kai-shek; the Indian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Agriculture, and Deputy Minister of Commerce, among other high-level officials, attending receptions and ceremonies held by Chiang Kai-shek clique members and the presentation of rice seeds to the Indian side; Indian newspapers and news agencies openly referring to Chiang Kai-shek clique members as "Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China," among other series of facts. The note continued: "The Indian government's blatant portrayal of Chiang Kai-shek clique members as representatives of a state and openly colluding with them to jointly engage in anti-China activities fully illustrates the extent to which the Indian government's conspiracy to accelerate 'Two Chinas' has become so rampant."

The note also pointed out that the former Indian parliamentarian Viral Yudhan, with the support of the Indian Prime Minister, went to Taiwan to "meet" with the Chiang Kai-shek clique leaders and advocated the normalization of diplomatic relations between the two sides; the Secretary-General of the Congress Party parliamentary party, Ragunath Singh, at the invitation of the Chiang Kai-shek clique's fake Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Shen Xian, went to Taiwan and openly plotted to jointly engage in anti-China activities. These are facts of the Indian government's open collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which cannot be denied by the Indian government's so-called "private citizen visits."

The note refuted the Indian side's repeated use of the excuse of "freedom of assembly" to justify the Indian side's collusion with and joint celebration with the Chiang Kai-shek clique members of the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "national day" and other activities. The note said: This is utterly absurd. The activities of the Chiang Kai-shek clique members are anti-People's Republic of China activities and are evil plots to incite the overthrow of the Chinese government. The Indian government, while maintaining diplomatic relations with China, allows the Chiang Kai-shek clique members to openly engage in anti-China activities in India. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese government.

The note said: "The above series of anti-China activities by the Indian side are serious infringements on China's sovereignty and gross interference in China's internal affairs. The Indian side's note, however, falsely accuses China of interfering in India's internal affairs by protesting to the Indian side. This is extremely arrogant and unreasonable! Is anti-China your 'internal affairs'? Can you brazenly engage in anti-China activities, while the Chinese government has no right to protest?"

The note continued, saying that the Indian government, in order to exonerate itself from the guilt of its "Two Chinas" conspiracy, actually fabricated excuses in the note, saying that "the Chinese government in Beijing accepts diplomatic representative agencies from some countries that still maintain consulates in Taiwan." This sophistry is of no help to the Indian government. "It is known that there is indeed an imperialist country that verbally acknowledges only the People's Republic of China but in reality acts as an accomplice to the United States, plotting the 'Two Chinas' and 'One China, One Taiwan' conspiracies. For this reason, China's diplomatic relations with this country have not been normalized for more than a decade. Does the Indian government think that this situation is worthy of admiration? Does it also intend to follow the example of India's former colonial rulers on this issue?" The note also accused the Indian government of discriminating against and persecuting law-abiding overseas Chinese in India, detaining hundreds of innocent overseas Chinese in concentration camps and prisons for long periods, and ordering the Chinese-language newspaper "China News," which is dedicated to promoting Sino-Indian friendship, to cease publication, while allowing the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "India Daily" to openly engage in anti-China propaganda.

The note said: "Facts over the past few years have shown: Despite repeated protests from the Chinese government, the Indian government's conspiracy to create 'Two Chinas' and collude with the Chiang Kai-shek clique in anti-China activities has not only shown no signs of abatement but has become more brazen and blatant. The Indian government's actions have violated its repeated assurances of acknowledging only the People's Republic of China and its promises to 'prevent any pro-Kuomintang rallies and demonstrations' and to 'not allow any activities aimed at promoting the 'Two Chinas' concept.' This fully exposes the Indian government's hypocrisy and betrayal."

The note concluded: "The Chinese government wants to warn the Indian government: Your unscrupulous service to US imperialism in creating 'Two Chinas,' willingly acting as a lackey of imperialism and modern revisionism in anti-China activities, will only further expose your ugly face. All anti-China 'heroes' in the world have no good outcome, and you will be no exception."

    我外交部强烈抗议印度政府勾结蒋帮、干涉中国内政
    印度追随美帝制造“两个中国”决无好下场
    中国政府坚决反对任何人在任何时候、任何场合玩弄任何形式的“两个中国”的阴谋。印度政府在同中国保持外交关系的情况下，竟然纵容蒋帮分子在印度公开从事反华活动，这是中国政府绝对不能容忍的
    新华社一日讯　中华人民共和国外交部七月二十八日照会印度驻华大使馆，驳斥印度外交部五月十三日来照中为印度政府追随美帝国主义制造“两个中国”和勾结蒋帮反华的阴谋活动所进行的种种狡辩，并且向印度政府提出了强烈抗议。
    照会指出：印方来照本身就是它推行这种阴谋活动的又一次大暴露。照会说：“来照一再把窃踞中国台湾省的蒋介石集团分子称作‘福摩萨代表团’和
  ‘台湾代表’，并公然把台湾称作是什么国际组织的‘成员国’。这显然是对中国主权和中国内政的干涉，是明目张胆地制造‘一个中国、一个台湾’，是要使蒋帮分子在联合国和其他国际组织中继续非法占据中国席位的状况合法化。据报道，今年三月，印度总理甘地夫人在访问美国期间，就曾公然鼓吹所谓台湾地位‘有待确定’和‘一个中国、一个台湾’的谬论。印方散布这些谬论都是为美帝国主义搞‘两个中国’或‘一个中国、一个台湾’的阴谋效劳，要把台湾从中国割裂出去，使美国长期霸占台湾合法化。中国政府就此向印度政府提出强烈抗议，并且重申：台湾是中国神圣领土不可分割的一部分，中国对台湾的主权绝不容许外人干涉。中国政府坚决反对任何人在任何时候、任何场合玩弄任何形式的‘两个中国’的阴谋。”
    照会指出，印方来照根本无法否认中国政府一九六五年十一月六日和一九六六年四月二日照会中列举的印度政府勾结蒋帮、粗暴干涉中国内政的种种事实。
    照会列举了印度政府竭力利用国际会议推行“两个中国”的阴谋，纵容蒋帮分子在印度公开进行反华活动；印度总统、国大党主席、铁道部长等高级领导人接见蒋帮分子，还要他们代向中国人民的公敌蒋介石“致意”；印度外交部长、粮农部长、商业部副部长等高级官员分别出席了蒋帮分子举行的招待会和向印方赠送稻种的仪式；印度报刊和通讯社还公然称蒋帮分子是“中华民国外交部次长”等一系列事实。照会接着说：“印度政府如此肆无忌惮地把蒋帮分子渲染成一个国家的代表，并公然勾结蒋帮分子共同反华，这就充分说明，印度政府加速推行‘两个中国’的阴谋，已经达到何等猖狂的地步。”
    照会还指出，印度前国会议员维拉尤丹，在印度总理支持下前往台湾，同蒋帮头目“会谈”，并且鼓吹双方“外交关系正常化”；印度执政党——国大党议会党团秘书长拉古纳特·辛格，应蒋帮伪外交部次长沈锜的邀请前往台湾，公然策划共同反华。这些都是印度政府同蒋帮公开勾搭的事实，不是印度政府用所谓“公民私人访问”能够抵赖得了的。
    照会驳斥了印方又一次搬出所谓“集会自由”的借口，为印方纵容并伙同蒋帮分子大肆庆祝蒋帮“国庆”等行为辩解。照会说：这是十分荒谬的。蒋帮分子进行的是反对中华人民共和国的活动，是煽动颠覆中国政府的罪恶勾当。印度政府，在同中国保持外交关系的情况下，竟然纵容蒋帮分子在印度公开从事反华活动，这是中国政府绝对不能容忍的。
    照会说：“印方的上述一系列反华活动，是对中国主权的严重侵犯，是对中国内政的粗暴干涉。印方来照却反诬中国向印方提出抗议是‘干涉印度内政’。这真是蛮横无理到了极点！难道反华就是你们的‘内政’吗？难道你们可以猖狂反华，而中国政府连抗议的权利也没有了吗？”
    照会接着说，印度政府为了替它搞“两个中国”阴谋的罪责开脱，竟在来照中编造借口，说什么“中国政府在北京接受外交代表机构的一些国家仍然在台湾保留领事馆”。这种诡辩丝毫帮不了印度政府的忙。“众所周知，确实有那么一个帝国主义国家，口头上表示只承认中华人民共和国，实际上却甘当美国的帮凶，制造‘两个中国’、‘一个中国、一个台湾’的阴谋。正因为如此，中国同这个国家的外交关系，十几年来一直不能正常化。难道印度政府认为，这种状况是值得羡慕的吗？难道在这个问题上，也准备效法印度过去的殖民统治者吗？”照会还指责印度政府对在印度的守法华侨进行了种种歧视和迫害，把几百名无辜华侨长期关押在集中营和监狱中，并且勒令致力于促进中印友好的华侨报纸《中国新闻》停刊，却允许蒋帮分子的《印度日报》公开进行反华宣传。
    照会说：几年来的事实表明：尽管中国政府一再提出抗议，印度政府推行“两个中国”阴谋和勾结蒋帮反华的活动不仅毫无收敛，反而变本加厉、日益露骨。印度政府的所作所为违背了它一再表示只承认中华人民共和国的保证，违背了它关于“要防止任何亲国民党的集会和示威”、关于“不允许旨在助长‘两个中国’的观念的任何活动”的诺言。这充分暴露了印度政府的伪善和背信弃义。
    照会最后说：“中国政府要正告印度政府：你们这样不择手段地为美帝国主义制造‘两个中国’效劳，甘心充当帝国主义和现代修正主义的反华走卒，只能进一步暴露你们的丑恶面目。世界上一切反华的‘英雄’都是没有好下场的，你们也决不会例外。”
