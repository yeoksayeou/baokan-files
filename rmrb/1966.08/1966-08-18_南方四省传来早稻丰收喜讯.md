	South China's four provinces have reported good news of early rice harvests. Hubei: Production exceeds last year's bumper harvest. Hunan: Area expanded, yield increased. Guangdong: Overcame floods to achieve a good harvest. Zhejiang: Low-yielding areas saw significant increases.

	According to Xinhua News Agency in Wuhan, Hubei Province has basically completed the harvest of early rice. Both the total production and the yield per unit area are higher than last year's bumper harvest. This fact once again vividly demonstrates that once the great thought of Mao Zedong is grasped by the masses, it will turn into a tremendous material force.

	In the first half of this year, Hubei Province experienced frequent natural disasters. The broad masses of rural cadres and commune members studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, following his teachings of "making up our minds, not fearing sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." They fought tenaciously against natural disasters. The masses in various places adopted various methods to expand water sources, conserve water, and ensure the normal growth of seedlings.

	According to Xinhua News Agency in Changsha, Hunan Province has basically completed the harvest of early rice. This year, Hunan Province's early rice planting area increased by more than 4.7 million mu compared to last year, and by more than 1 million mu compared to the year with the largest early rice planting area in history. From the situation of harvesting and threshing in various places, the yield per unit area is generally higher than last year.

	Since last winter, various places in Hunan Province have launched a massive campaign to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, further instilling in the broad masses of commune members the idea of farming for the revolution. This year, they have vigorously promoted high-yield varieties of early rice, with high-yield varieties accounting for more than 80% of the early rice area in the province. The standards for transplanting, fertilization, and plowing and harrowing have also exceeded those of previous years.

	During the harvest of early rice, cadres and commune members carried Mao's quotations to the fields, and leaders at all levels went to the front lines. Government agencies, schools, and various industries dispatched large numbers of people to the countryside to support the battle of rushing to harvest early rice and rush to transplant late rice, speeding up the harvesting process.

	According to Xinhua News Agency in Guangzhou, the broad masses of people's communes in Guangdong's rural areas have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong's thought. From the tillering period of early rice, they have overcome continuous low temperatures, rainy weather, and flood disasters, and this year's total production of early rice in the province has slightly increased compared to the bumper harvest of 1965.

	At present, the 27 million mu of early rice in the entire province have been completely harvested. Except for the Huicheng and Foshan districts, which suffered significant losses due to a major flood disaster, the early rice yield is slightly lower than in 1965, the other districts have all increased production compared to 1965. Cadres and the masses said that turning a disaster year into a bumper harvest year is the result of reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, despising difficulties, daring to struggle, and daring to win.

	When major rivers in the province experienced major floods, cadres and the masses in various places in Guangdong immediately rushed to the front lines of the anti-flood struggle and fought against the floods, finally minimizing the damage caused by the floods to early rice, and making early rice in most parts of the province still increase production.

	According to Xinhua News Agency in Hangzhou, the broad masses of commune members in Zhejiang Province listened to Chairman Mao's words and acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions, achieving victory in rushing to harvest early rice and rush to transplant late rice. Early rice in various places has generally achieved a good harvest.

	This year, early rice in Zhejiang grew sturdy and thick, with large and full grains. Many originally low-yielding communes in Jinhua, Lishui, and Zhoushan regions have achieved significant increases in production; many originally high-yielding communes in Wenzhou, Taizhou, Ningbo, and Shaoxing regions have continued to increase production this year. The broad masses of commune members sang praises to the great victory of Mao Zedong's thought while harvesting bumper rice. Some islands in Zhoushan that have always lacked water have achieved an unprecedented good harvest of early rice this year due to the construction of reservoirs. The commune members said: This is all thanks to Chairman Mao's good leadership.

　　南方四省传来早稻丰收喜讯
　　湖北：产量高于丰收的去年　湖南：面积扩大单产提高
　　广东：战胜水灾夺得好收成　浙江：低产地区大量增产
    据新华社武汉电　湖北省早稻已基本收割完毕，无论总产量或单位面积产量，都高于丰收的去年。这一事实再次雄辩地表明，伟大的毛泽东思想一旦被广大群众所掌握，就会变成巨大的物质力量。
    今年上半年，湖北省自然灾害十分频繁。广大农村干部和社员，活学活用毛主席著作，遵照毛主席的“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，同自然灾害进行了顽强的斗争。各地群众采取多种多样的办法，扩充水源，节约用水，保证了禾苗正常生长。
    据新华社长沙电　湖南省早稻已经基本收割结束。今年，湖南省早稻种植面积比去年增加四百七十多万亩，比历史上早稻面积最多的一年增加一百多万亩。从各地收割脱粒的情况看，单位面积产量一般都比去年高。
    去冬以来，湖南省各地就开展了一个声势浩大的活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，使广大社员进一步树立了为革命种田的思想。今年他们推广早稻高产良种的劲头特别大，全省栽插的高产良种约占早稻面积的百分之八十以上。插秧规格、施肥情况和犁耙质量，也都超过往年。
    在收割早稻期间，广大干部、社员带着毛主席语录牌到田间，各级领导都亲临前线，机关、学校和各行各业都抽调大批人员下乡，支援抢收早稻、抢插晚稻的战斗，加快了收割进度。
    据新华社广州电　广东农村广大人民公社社员高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，从早稻分蘖期开始，战胜了连续不断的低温阴雨天气和洪水灾害，今年全省早稻总产量比丰收的一九六五年略有增加。
    目前，全省二千七百多万亩早稻，已全部收割完毕。除惠阳、佛山两专区因受特大洪水灾害，损失较大，早稻产量略低于一九六五年以外，其余各专区都比一九六五年增产。干部和群众说，灾年变成丰收年，是读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，藐视困难，敢于斗争，敢于胜利的结果。
    当各主要江河出现了特大洪水时，广东各地广大干部和群众立即奔赴抗洪斗争前线，和洪水进行搏斗，终于把洪水对早稻的为害缩小到最低限度，使全省大部分地区早稻仍然增产。
    据新华社杭州电　浙江省广大社员听毛主席的话，按照毛主席的指示办事，取得了抢收早稻和抢插晚稻的胜利。各地早稻普遍获得了好收成。
    今年浙江早稻长得秆壮穗粗，粒大饱满。金华、丽水、舟山等地区许多原来产量较低的社队获得大幅度增产；温州、台州、宁波、绍兴等地区许多原来高产的社队，今年又继续增产。广大社员一边收割丰收稻，一边歌颂毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。舟山专区一些向来缺水的海岛，由于兴建了水库，今年早稻获得从来没有过的好收成。社员们说：这全靠毛主席的好领导。
