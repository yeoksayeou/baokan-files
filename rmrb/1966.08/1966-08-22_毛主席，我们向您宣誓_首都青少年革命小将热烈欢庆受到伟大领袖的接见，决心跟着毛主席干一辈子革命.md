Chairman Mao, we pledge to you
The young revolutionary guards of the capital enthusiastically celebrate being received by the great leader, determined to follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 21st, tens of thousands of young revolutionary guards from schools in the capital have been living in a state of great excitement and happiness these days. They have all pledged to their most beloved leader, Chairman Mao: We will definitely follow you in revolution for life! We will carry forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to venture, daring to do, daring to revolutionize, and daring to rebel, smashing the old world and building a new world.

In the campus, in the classrooms, in the dormitories, groups of revolutionary guards are everywhere enthusiastically discussing the warm scene when their most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, met with them. Many "Red Guards" warriors held oath-taking rallies, many gathered together to express their determination, many read Chairman Mao's quotations aloud together, and many sang "The East Is Red" and "The Ship Sails on the Ocean" over and over again. They said: Happiness! Happiness! Our great leader, great commander, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao, it is you who have shown us the way forward, it is your hands that are tightly held with ours. We love you the most and listen to your words the most. We will definitely follow your teachings, care about state affairs, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end.

Peng Xiaomeng, a 17-year-old student from Beijing No. 2 Middle School, and some of her classmates began to study the "Sixteen Points" personally led by Chairman Mao as soon as it was published. Peng Xiaomeng said: "The 'Sixteen Points' speak to our hearts. The more we read, the clearer we become, as if Chairman Mao is by our side, guiding us forward. We will not disappoint the trust and expectations of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao in us young people. We will definitely continue to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of rebellion, study while working, work while studying, learn in struggle, and grow in struggle. We will definitely faithfully execute the 'Sixteen Points' and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end!"

Twenty-six young revolutionary guards from Tsinghua No. 2 Middle School met Chairman Mao on Tiananmen Gate and shook hands with him, taking a photo. Chairman Mao also talked with them. The great leader's support brought them immense encouragement. That night, more than a thousand revolutionary teachers and students at Tsinghua No. 2 Middle School gathered in front of a giant portrait of Chairman Mao to hold an oath-taking rally. Those who had seen Chairman Mao introduced the warm and joyful scene of Chairman Mao meeting with them to everyone and said excitedly: Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in our hearts. Chairman Mao's sacred book shines with golden light. We will definitely always read Chairman Mao's books, word by word and sentence by sentence, always listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and always follow Chairman Mao forward in great winds and waves! The revolutionary guards pledged in front of Chairman Mao's portrait: "Beloved Chairman Mao, we will definitely not disappoint your expectations and resolutely carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end! You will definitely see it, a school of Mao Zedong Thought that is both industrial and agricultural, both literary and martial, will appear in socialist China."

The "Red Guards" warriors from Beijing No. 1 Girls' Middle School who saw Chairman Mao on Tiananmen Gate said excitedly that they will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, not fear the current, not fear twists and turns, learn to swim while swimming, and learn to fight while fighting. In the sharp and complex class struggle, they will definitely demand of themselves according to the five criteria for successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause proposed by Chairman Mao, unite the broad masses, and do a good job of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in their school.

    毛主席，我们向您宣誓
    首都青少年革命小将热烈欢庆受到伟大领袖的接见，决心跟着毛主席干一辈子革命
    据新华社二十一日讯　首都大中学校成千上万的革命小将们，这几天一直生活在无比激动、无比幸福之中。他们纷纷向最敬爱的领袖毛主席宣誓：我们一定跟着您干一辈子革命！我们要发扬敢闯，敢干，敢革命，敢造反的无产阶级革命精神，砸碎旧世界，建设新世界。
    在校园里，在教室里，在宿舍里，成群结队的革命小将到处在热烈地谈论着最敬爱的领袖毛主席会见他们时的亲切情景。许多“红卫兵”战士在开誓师大会，许多人围聚在一起互表决心，许多人在一起放声朗读毛主席语录，许多人在一起一遍又一遍地纵情高歌《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》。他们说：幸福呀！幸福！我们的伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席，是您为我们指引了前进的方向，是您的双手和我们紧紧握在一起。我们最热爱您，最听您的话，我们一定按照您的教导，关心国家大事，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    十七岁的北大附中学生彭小蒙和她的一些同学，从毛主席亲自领导制定的《十六条》刚一公布后，就认真地学习起来。彭小蒙说：“十六条一字一句都说到我们的心眼里，我们愈读愈感到心明眼亮，就像毛主席在我们身边，给我们指引着前进的方向。我们决不辜负党中央和毛主席对我们青少年的信任和期望，一定要继续发扬革命的造反精神，边学边干，边干边学，在斗争中学习，在斗争中成长。我们一定忠诚地执行十六条，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”
    清华附中有二十六名革命小将在天安门城楼上会见了敬爱的领袖毛主席，和毛主席握了手，照了像。毛主席还同他们谈了话。伟大领袖的支持给他们带来了巨大的鼓舞力量。这天晚上，在清华附中的校园里，全校一千多名革命师生围在毛主席的巨幅画像前举行了誓师大会。见到过毛主席的革命小将们，在向大家介绍了毛主席会见他们时的热烈欢腾情景后，激动地说：毛主席是我们心中最红最红的太阳。毛主席的宝书闪金光，我们一定永远读毛主席的书，字字句句地读，永远听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，永远跟着毛主席在大风大浪中前进！革命小将们在毛主席像前宣誓：“敬爱的毛主席，我们一定不辜负您的期望，坚决把文化大革命进行到底！您一定看得见，一个亦工亦农、能文能武的毛泽东思想的大学校将出现在社会主义的中国。”
    在天安门城楼见到了毛主席的北京女一中“红卫兵”小战士们非常激动地说，我们一定按照毛主席的教导，不怕逆流，不怕曲折，在游泳中学会游泳，在斗争中学会斗争。在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，我们一定按照毛主席提出的无产阶级革命事业接班人五条标准来要求自己，团结广大群众，把我们学校的无产阶级文化大革命搞好。
