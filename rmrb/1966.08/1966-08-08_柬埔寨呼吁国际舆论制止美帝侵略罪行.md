		The Strongest and Most Vigorous Protest Against U.S.-South Vietnamese Air Raids on Border Villages
		Cambodia Appeals to International Opinion to Stop U.S. Aggression
		Vietnamese Foreign Ministry Supports Cambodian Government Statement Strongly Condemning U.S. and Its Puppets' Provocative Actions
		New China News Agency, Phnom Penh, August 4
		According to a report by the Cambodian News Agency on August 4, the Royal Government of Cambodia issued a statement on August 3, strongly protesting the barbaric actions of U.S.-South Vietnamese aircraft bombing Cambodian border villages.

		The statement said that on July 31 and August 2, U.S.-South Vietnamese military aircraft deliberately violated Cambodian airspace, entering the sky above Trota village in Pursat province, about 300 meters from the border, and conducted indiscriminate bombing. As a result, a pregnant woman and two infants were killed, nine were injured, and a batch of houses were destroyed.

		The statement said that on August 2, when U.S.-South Vietnamese aircraft invaded Cambodia for the second time, members of the International Control Commission and foreign observers invited by the Cambodian government were on the scene conducting investigations. They were eyewitnesses to the heinous crimes committed by the U.S.-South Vietnamese military against Cambodian residents.

		The statement finally appealed to all peace-loving and justice-seeking countries and peoples to take necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such acts of aggression against Cambodia.

		New China News Agency, Hanoi, August 7
		The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on August 6, strongly condemning the serious crimes of U.S. imperialism and its South Vietnamese puppets, who again sent aircraft to bomb Cambodian territory—Trota village—on July 31 and August 2.

		The statement said that it is clear that U.S. imperialism and its puppets have grossly violated the sovereignty and territory of the Kingdom of Cambodia.

		The statement pointed out that this crime by U.S. imperialism and its puppets exposed the deceitful propaganda of U.S. imperialism's recent so-called "guarantee to respect Cambodia's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity."

		The statement expressed support for the just stance taken in the August 3 statement by the Royal Government of Cambodia and firmly demanded that U.S. imperialism and its puppets immediately stop all acts of aggression and provocation against the Kingdom of Cambodia.

		The statement emphasized that U.S. imperialism and its puppets must bear full responsibility for all consequences arising from this.

    声明说，七月三十一日和八月二日，美国—南越军队的飞机蓄意侵犯柬埔寨领空，侵入了（磅湛省）距边界线约三百米的特洛塔村上空，进行狂轰滥炸，致使一名孕妇和两个婴儿被打死，九人受伤，并且有一批房屋被破坏。
    声明说，八月二日美国—南越飞机第二次入侵柬埔寨时，国际监督委员会的成员和柬埔寨政府邀请的外国观察家正在现场进行调查。他们是美国—南越军队对柬埔寨居民犯下恶毒罪行的目击者。
