	Mao Zedong Thought passes from generation to generation.
	Fu Jincheng

	Commissar, soldier, and instructor,
	Holding "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" by the lamp,
	Words from the heart pour forth,
	Everyone discusses their study insights.

	The commissar says: "Remember the past,
	Following Chairman Mao to fight for the country,
	Power comes from the barrel of a gun,
	The three great mountains have been overthrown!"

	The instructor says: "Look at now,
	Chairman Mao is at the helm, we steer the boat,
	Piercing clouds and breaking through mist to show the way,
	Braving rapids and surging forward without hindrance!"

	The soldier says: "Looking to the future,
	The five continents and four seas will turn red;
	Chairman Mao's words are etched in our hearts,
	We dare to shoulder the revolutionary task!"

	Words are endless, feelings boundless,
	Gazing into the future, enthusiasm is added,
	Ears ring with thunderous sounds,
	Hearts swell with ten thousand red flags unfurled!

	The river of revolution flows unceasingly,
	Mao Zedong Thought passes from generation to generation;
	Songs of praise resonate around the world:
	The unsetting sun shines red across the sky!

　　傅金城
　　政委、战士、指导员，
　　手捧“毛选”坐灯前，
　　心底话儿涌出口，
　　学习心得大家谈。
　　政委说：“想当年，
　　跟着毛主席打江山，
　　枪杆子里出政权，
　　三座大山被推翻！”

　　毛主席掌舵咱撑船，
　　穿云破雾指方向，
　　激流勇进无阻拦！”
　　战士说：“望将来，
　　五洲四海要红遍；

　　革命的重任咱敢担！”
　　话无尽呵情无限，

　　胸中万杆红旗展！
　　革命长河流不断，
　　毛泽东思想代代传；
　　赞歌向着世界唱：
