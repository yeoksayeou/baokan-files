This evening, another group of foreign friends who participated in the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers concluded their visit and sightseeing in Shanghai. They departed Shanghai by plane, carrying with them the friendship of unity and struggle, and returned to their home countries.

More than a thousand people gathered at the airport to see them off. They shook hands and embraced repeatedly with the Asian and African friends who were about to return to their posts of struggle. The Asian and African friends confidently told their hosts that they would definitely come to Beijing next year to attend the Third Conference of Asian and African Writers, and that they would come again to Shanghai with more comrades to visit.

The people who came to see them off and the Asian and African friends together sang "The East Is Red" and "The Internationale," and chanted slogans such as "Long Live Chairman Mao," "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought," "Long Live the Unity of Asian and African Writers," and "Long Live the Unity of All Peoples of the World." They wished the Asian and African friends greater victories in their revolutionary struggles against imperialism and colonialism.

Those who went to the airport to see them off included Liu Baiyu, deputy leader of the Chinese delegation to the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers, and some members of the delegation.

Responsible officials from various relevant departments in Shanghai, including Meng Bo, Ba Jin, Feng Guozhu, Zhang Zhenya, and the writer Lu Mang, also went to the airport to see them off.
