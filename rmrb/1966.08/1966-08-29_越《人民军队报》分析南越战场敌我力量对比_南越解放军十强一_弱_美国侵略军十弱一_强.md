The People's Army Newspaper of Vietnam analyzed the comparison of enemy and friendly forces on the South Vietnamese battlefield in an article published on August 26. The article pointed out that the U.S. invaders have ten weaknesses and one strength, while the liberation forces have ten strengths and one weakness. Therefore, the outcome of the war in South Vietnam will inevitably be the defeat of the U.S. invaders and the victory of the Vietnamese people.

The article stated that the so-called strength of the United States lies in its advanced war industry, which allows it to transport large quantities of military supplies to South Vietnam. However, the reality on the battlefield is that, apart from this one strength, the United States has ten weaknesses. These ten weaknesses are:

First, the command is in disarray, and the strategy is indecisive.

Second, they are in a state of siege, unable to break free or move.

Third, they are despised by everyone, heaven and earth do not tolerate them.

Fourth, for the U.S. troops, the puppet army is a nuisance, but they cannot do without it.

Fifth, the U.S. expeditionary forces are financially draining, and the prolonged war is exhausting.

Sixth, U.S. soldiers are demoralized and have low morale.

Seventh, although the number of troops is large, their combat effectiveness is poor.

Eighth, U.S. infantry is cowardly and weak.

Ninth, the leaders are incompetent.

Tenth, U.S. tactics do not work in South Vietnam.

The article then pointed out that, compared to the U.S. troops, the liberation forces are weaker in terms of equipment and supplies, lacking air force, navy, and mechanized troops. However, the liberation forces have the most fundamental advantage, which is justice and an invincible spirit of tenacity. The article said that the ten strengths of the liberation forces are:

First, the strategic guidance is very correct.

Second, the formation is as stable as the Truong Son Mountains (Truong Son is the largest mountain range in Vietnam).

Third, the strength of the military and people of South Vietnam is like the endless waters of the Nine Dragon River. Their supplies and reinforcements come from the local area and from the enemy's warehouses and hands.

Fourth, the resolve of the military and people of South Vietnam is as firm as the mountains and rivers of the motherland.

Fifth, the military and people of South Vietnam have the favorable conditions of heaven, earth, and people.

Sixth, the people of South Vietnam use the strength of the entire nation to strike the enemy, and every person is a warrior to annihilate the enemy.

Seventh, the South Vietnamese army is skilled in battle and tenacious.

Eighth, the entire army can maneuver to attack the enemy.

Ninth, the military and people of South Vietnam have many military talents, and these talents are constantly growing among the youth.

Tenth, the combat methods of the military and people of South Vietnam are innovative and diverse. The U.S. invaders try every means but cannot find a safe place and cannot stop the advance of the military and people of South Vietnam.

The People's Army Newspaper concluded that the military and people of South Vietnam are invincible. They use their ten strengths to limit the enemy's single strength and directly attack the enemy's ten weaknesses. The more victories the people of South Vietnam achieve, the more their strengths will increase and develop. The more the enemy loses, the more mistakes they make, the more miserable their defeat will be. The enemy's strength will continue to shrink, their weaknesses will deepen and expand, and new weaknesses will emerge. Therefore, the enemy cannot avoid suffering continuous defeats.

    越《人民军队报》分析南越战场敌我力量对比
    南越解放军十强一“弱”  美国侵略军十弱一“强”
    新华社河内二十八日电　越南《人民军队报》二十六日在一篇论述南越战场上敌我力量对比的评论中指出，美国侵略者是十弱一“强”，而解放武装力量则是十强一“弱”。因此，南越战争的结局定是美国侵略者必败，越南人民必胜。
    评论说，美国的所谓“强”，是它有着发达的战争工业，能够向南越运送大量军事物资。然而，战场上的事实是：美国除了这一“强”外，它却有十弱。这十弱是：
    第一、指挥上不知所措，战略上犹疑不决。
    第二、处于被围困状态，挣不脱，动不了。
    第三、天地不容，人人憎恨。
    第四、对于美军来说，伪军是个祸害，但美军又离不开它。
    第五、美军远征耗财，战争拖长耗力。
    第六、美国士兵精神涣散，士气低落。
    第七、军队人数虽多，但战斗力很差。
    第八、美国步兵更是胆小虚弱。
    第九、将领无能。
    第十、美国的战术，在南越行不通。
    评论接着指出，在战场上，解放武装力量同美军相比，装备和物资比敌人弱，没有空军、海军和机械化部队。但是，解放武装力量却有着最根本的长处，这就是正义，是无敌的顽强精神。评论说，解放武装力量的十强是：
    第一、战略指导非常正确。
    第二、阵势稳如长山（长山是越南最大的山脉）。
    第三、越南南方军民的力量犹如南越九龙江水那样无穷无尽。他们的接济和补充源泉就在原地，也来自敌人的仓库和敌人的手里。
    第四、越南南方军民的决心犹如祖国的山河那样坚定。
    第五、越南南方军民拥有天时地利人和的有利条件。
    第六、越南南方人民以全民的力量打击敌人，每一个人就是一名歼敌战士。
    第七、越南南方军队善战、顽强。
    第八、全军都能机动地进攻敌人。
    第九、越南南方军民拥有众多的军事人材，而且这些人材正在青年当中不断成长。
    第十、越南南方军民的作战方法具有独创性，丰富多采。美国侵略者想尽办法也找不到安全之处，也阻挡不了越南南方军民的进攻。
    《人民军队报》的评论最后说，越南南方军民是无敌的。他们用自己的十强限制敌人唯一的一“强”，直接进攻敌人的十弱。越南南方人民越胜利，他们的长处就越会增加和发展，敌人越输，犯错误越多，就失败得越惨。敌人的长处越来越缩小，他们的弱点越来越加深和扩大，并产生许多新的弱点，因此敌人无法避免遭到连续的失败。（附图片）
