	Singing the praises of the brave Red Guards,
	Fearless of heaven, fearless of earth,
	The Red Guards' hearts are red, their courage unmatched,
	Wielding the revolutionary iron broom,
	They charge through storms and waves.
	Fearless of heaven, fearless of earth,
	The Red Guards' hearts are red, their spirits soar,
	Wielding the great red pen of the proletariat,
	They paint a new red world.
	See: Everything is renewed,
	Hear: Praises echo across the seas.
	The revolutionary people cheer, "Excellent!"
	All reactionaries tremble in fear.
	Red Guards, Red Guards,
	Your power is great, your fame is vast,
	Where does this boundless strength come from?
	The Red Guards listen to the Party's words.
	Chairman Mao's teachings are etched in our hearts,
	The Sixteen Points are our guiding light,
	Each of us has a red sun in our hearts,
	Red Guards, we follow Chairman Mao to victory.
	Hail: The Red Guards lead the charge,
	Hail: Thousands and tens of thousands of sunflowers bloom!
	Hail: The Red Guards are reliable successors,
	Hail: The motherland strides forward!

    歌唱英勇小将红卫兵
    天不怕，地不怕，
    红卫兵心红胆最大，
    高举革命的铁扫帚，
    大风大浪里猛冲杀。
    天不怕，地不怕，
    红卫兵心红志气大，
    高举无产阶级大红笔，
    描绘崭新的红天下。
    看：处处换新装，
    听：四海传佳话。
    革命人民齐呼好得很，
    一切反动派害了怕。
    红卫兵呵红卫兵，
    威力大呀名声大，
    这无穷的力量哪里来？
    红卫兵最听党的话。
    毛主席教导牢记心，
    十六条决定是灯塔，
    个个胸中有轮红太阳，
    红卫兵，紧跟毛主席打天下。
    欢呼：红卫兵打先锋，
    欢呼：千朵万朵向阳花！
    欢呼：红卫兵是可靠的接班人，
    欢呼 ：祖国跨上跃进马！
