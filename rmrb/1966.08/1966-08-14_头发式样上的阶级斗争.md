We must better utilize the most powerful weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, hold high the revolutionary banner of criticism, criticize the bourgeoisie, criticize the old world, criticize for a lifetime, struggle for a lifetime, and revolutionize for a lifetime!

A few years ago, domestic and foreign class enemies stirred up a black wind of anti-party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought. People like Deng Tuo used every means to promote "peaceful evolution," extensively advocating the decadent lifestyle of the exploiting classes. They made a big fuss about women's hair, shamelessly saying things like "women with long hair are beautiful" and how the women in the imperial court had long, beautiful hair, and so on. This black wind also blew into our industry. Styles like the "big bun," "feather duster head," and Western-style "delinquent hair" all emerged. Our shop was also influenced by this black wind and had to cut some of these strange styles for some customers.

Chairman Mao, in the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, sounded the alarm for the entire nation: "Never forget class struggle!" I seriously studied Chairman Mao's instructions on class and class struggle, and my mind became clear. I gradually understood that the bourgeoisie uses strange hairstyles to compete with us for the masses and the next generation; this is the bourgeoisie's arrogant attack on our proletariat. Class struggle also exists in hairstyles. Being obsessed with strange hairstyles is to promote the bourgeois lifestyle. Our service industry would then become a tool for serving capitalist restoration!

As a Communist Party member and a shop leader, I cannot allow bourgeois things to spread freely. I organized the barbers to study Chairman Mao's works together, strengthen the awareness of class struggle, and jointly resist cutting strange hairstyles. At the same time, I enthusiastically and patiently explained to customers the significance of breaking away from the bourgeois lifestyle and establishing new socialist revolutionary customs. For the few who insisted and cursed at us, we firmly criticized and refuted them.

While breaking away from "strange hairstyles," we went deep into the factory areas' barbershops, listened to the workers' opinions on hairstyles, and designed nearly ten new styles that are elegant, simple, and natural, which were welcomed by the masses.

Chairman Mao's recent call for everyone to criticize the bourgeoisie is a great goal for us service industry workers to strive for. The most powerful weapon to criticize the bourgeoisie is Mao Zedong Thought. We will definitely better utilize Mao Zedong Thought, this most powerful weapon, and hold high the revolutionary banner of criticism. We will criticize the non-proletarian thoughts in our minds, criticize the capitalist management ideas and styles in the barber industry, criticize the bourgeoisie, criticize the old world, criticize for a lifetime, struggle for a lifetime, and revolutionize for a lifetime!

　　头发式样上的阶级斗争
    我们要更好地运用毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器，高高举起革命的批判的旗帜，批判资产阶级，批判旧世界，批判一辈子，斗争一辈子，革命一辈子！
　　上海市人民代表、六好职工南京理发公司经理兼理发师  刘瑞卿
    前几年，国内外阶级敌人刮起了一股反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的黑风，如邓拓之流千方百计搞“和平演变”，大肆宣扬剥削阶级腐朽的生活方式，在女人头上大做文章，无耻地说什么“女人长发美”呀，皇帝宫廷的女人头发怎样长，怎样好看呀，等等。这股黑风也刮到我们理发行业里来了。什么“大包头”，“鸡毛掸帚头”，以及西方式样的“阿飞头”，都纷纷出笼。我们店受这股黑风的影响，也曾为部分顾客理了一些怪式样。
    毛主席在党的八届十中全会上向全国人民敲响了警钟：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争！”我认真学习了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的指示，头脑清醒了，心明眼亮了，逐渐懂得，资产阶级用奇形怪状的头发式样和我们争夺群众和下一代，这就是资产阶级对我们无产阶级的猖狂进攻；头发式样上同样存在着阶级斗争。热中于理怪发式，就是在宣扬资产阶级的生活方式，我们服务行业就要变成为资本主义复辟“服务”的工具！
    作为一个共产党员，一个店的领导，我决不能让资产阶级的东西自由泛滥。我发动理发员一起学习毛主席著作，加强阶级斗争观念，共同起来抵制理怪发式；同时，热情耐心地向顾客宣传解释破除资产阶级生活方式，树立社会主义革命新风尚的意义。对少数人的无理纠缠和谩骂，我们就义正辞严地加以批判和驳斥。
    我们在破“怪发式”的同时，深入到工厂区的理发馆，听取工人群众对发式的意见，设计了近十种大方、朴素、自然的新发式，受到群众欢迎。
    毛主席最近提出的人人批判资产阶级的号召，是我们服务行业职工努力奋斗的伟大目标。批判资产阶级的最锐利武器，就是毛泽东思想。我们一定更好地运用毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器，把革命的批判的旗帜高高举起，批判自己头脑里的非无产阶级思想，批判理发行业中的资本主义经营思想、经营作风，批判资产阶级，批判旧世界，批判一辈子，斗争一辈子，革命一辈子！
