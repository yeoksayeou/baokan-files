Chairman Mao geniusly developed Marxism-Leninism
Finnish friend Vaino Hämäläinen says the Chinese Communist Party is the vanguard of the proletariat respected by all countries

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Khartoum, Sudanese prominent medical expert and former member of the Supreme Council, Dr. Tiganiy Mahjub, recently told a Xinhua News Agency reporter in Khartoum that Chairman Mao Zedong is one of the greatest figures in human history. He is not only a great philosopher but also the great leader of the Chinese revolution. He said that Mao Zedong Thought is an eternal fundamental truth.

Dr. Tiganiy said that Chairman Mao Zedong geniusly applied the theories of Marxism-Leninism to the realities of China and developed Marxism-Leninism to a new stage. Chairman Mao Zedong's genius is manifested in all aspects. His works are easy to understand, and people can see their future in his works.

He emphasized that one of Chairman Mao Zedong's greatest contributions is to place human factors in the first position, fully mobilize human factors, and guide people to strive in the right direction.

He pointed out that the Chinese revolution can bring about changes in all aspects of this country, enabling China to achieve such tremendous successes in just sixteen years that no other revolution in human history has ever achieved. The reason lies in this.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki: Finnish friend Vaino Hämäläinen recently wrote an article saying: "Modern revisionists pretend to be revolutionary, but in reality, they support imperialism, truly betray Marxism-Leninism, and truly betray the revolution. However, they cannot stop the advance of the revolution. Their traitorous faces have been exposed. The revolutionary will of the people has produced a new vanguard of the proletariat and new proletarian revolutionary leaders. Just as the Communist Party of the Soviet Union under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, now the Chinese Communist Party is the vanguard of the proletariat respected by all countries. Mao Zedong is the undisputed leader of the proletarian revolution in the contemporary world and the beloved mentor of the revolutionary people of all countries."

    苏丹著名人士提加尼说毛泽东思想是永远适用的真理
    毛主席天才地发展了马克思列宁主义
    芬兰朋友海曼莱依宁说中国共产党是各国无产阶级崇敬的先锋队
    据新华社喀土穆电苏丹著名医学专家、前国家最高委员会委员提加尼·马希博士最近在这里对新华社记者发表谈话时说，毛泽东主席是人类历史上最伟大的人物之一。他不仅是一位伟大的哲学家，同时也是中国革命的伟大领袖。他说，毛泽东思想是永远适用的根本真理。
  提加尼博士说，毛泽东主席天才地把马克思列宁主义的理论应用于中国的实际，并且把马克思列宁主义的理论发展到了一个新的阶段。毛泽东主席的天才体现在各个方面。他的著作是容易理解的，人民可以从他的著作中看到自己的未来。
    他强调指出，毛泽东主席的最伟大的贡献之一，就是把人的因素放在第一位，使人的因素充分发挥作用，引导人们向正确的方向努力。
    他指出，中国革命能够使这个国家的各个方面发生变化，使中国能够在短短的十六年期间取得了人类历史上任何革命从来没有取得的这样巨大的成就，原因就在于此。
    据新华社讯　赫尔辛基消息：芬兰朋友凡伊诺·海曼莱依宁最近写文章说：“现代修正主义者假装革命，实际上是真支持帝国主义，真背叛马克思列宁主义，真背叛革命。但是，他们阻挡不了革命的前进。他们的叛徒面目已经暴露无遗。人民的革命意志产生了新的无产阶级先锋队和新的无产阶级革命领袖。同列宁和斯大林领导下的苏联共产党一样，现在，中国共产党是各国无产阶级所崇敬的先锋队。毛泽东是当代世界无产阶级革命的无可争辩的领袖和各国革命人民敬爱的导师。”
