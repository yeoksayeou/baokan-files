Sun Yefang, in order to peddle his thoroughgoing revisionist black goods, implemented a feudal gangster-like, factionalist cadre policy in the Economic Research Institute. Over the years, he used despicable methods such as granting titles and positions, surrendering and defecting, to gather a group of rightist elements, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, degenerate elements, anti-party elements, and so on. Under the protection of Sun Yefang's "big red umbrella," these demons and monsters transformed themselves into so-called "talented" and "living dictionaries" experts and scholars, receiving great respect. They ate the people's food and engaged in anti-party and anti-socialist activities, turning the Economic Research Institute into a black gang stronghold.

Sun Yefang's methods of surrender and defection are extremely vile. Here are just a few examples.

Sun Yefang highly praised the ultra-rightist element Gu Zhen, who had been labeled a rightist twice, not only personally recruiting him to the institute but also boasting about him everywhere, saying he had "talent" and that it was "a pity he made mistakes." To expand the influence of this rightist, Sun Yefang even assigned a graduate student to Gu Zhen, cultivating successors for the reactionary class. He even promised Gu Zhen, saying, "If you help me well, and the higher-ups adopt it, you will also have merit and can strive to rejoin the party."

The rightist Lin Lifu not only did not admit his guilt but also acted arrogantly, waiting for an opportunity to reverse his case. Sun Yefang even stepped forward to help Lin Lifu reverse his case. Due to the firm opposition of the masses, the plot did not succeed. Sun Yefang continued to praise Lin Lifu as having "knowledge" and being a "living dictionary," transferring him from the library to the Economic Thought History Group for research, and even fabricated a so-called "assessment of merits and demerits" to "award merits" to Lin Lifu.

In 1960, when our institute streamlined its organization, Sun Yefang still forcibly retained several people with serious political suspicions and historical crimes. Later, he personally recruited more demons and monsters. In addition to the rightist Gu Zhen mentioned above, Sun Yefang also insisted on recruiting a cultural spy to the institute, but this was stopped by higher authorities and did not succeed.

From the above examples, it can be seen that the group Sun Yefang gathered is a counter-revolutionary force that harbors deep hatred for the party and socialism. They formed a gang, releasing batch after batch of poisonous weeds and shooting arrow after arrow of poison, launching a frenzied attack on the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the Three Red Banners.

Sun Yefang is a thoroughgoing revisionist vanguard and also the chief culprit of surrender and defection. Since the founding of the country, he has used the method of covering up everything and deceiving both superiors and subordinates to pass through every movement. It was not until this great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the sun of Mao Zedong Thought, that he was completely exposed. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and drag out all the demons and monsters in the field of economics, fight them down, fight them to the ground, and fight them to the end, to seize back the positions of the proletariat.

　　孙冶方招降纳叛的罪行
    孙冶方为了贩卖他的彻头彻尾修正主义黑货，在经济研究所实行了一套封建帮会的、结党营私的干部路线。多年以来，他运用封官许愿、招降纳叛等卑鄙手段，纠集了一批资产阶级右派分子、反革命分子、坏分子、蜕化变质分子、反党分子等等。这群牛鬼蛇神在孙冶方这顶“大红伞”的保护下，摇身一变而成为所谓“有才华”、“活字典”的“专家”、“学者”，倍受尊重。他们吃人民的饭，干反党反社会主义的勾当，把经济研究所变成了一个黑帮据点。
    孙冶方所施行的一套招降纳叛的手法，是极其恶劣的。这里仅举数例。
    孙冶方对两次戴上右派分子帽子的极右分子顾准大加赏识，不仅亲自出马，把他收罗来所，还到处替他吹嘘，说他有“才华”、“犯了错误很可惜”。孙冶方为了扩大这个右派分子的影响，竟给顾准配备研究生，为反动阶级培养接班人。甚至他还对顾准封官许愿说：“你好好帮助我搞，将来上面采纳了，你也有功，可以争取重新入党。”
    右派分子林里夫不但不低头认罪，而且还十分嚣张，伺机翻案。孙冶方竟挺身而出，为林里夫翻案。由于群众坚决反对，阴谋未能得逞。孙冶方仍到处吹捧林里夫“有知识”，是“活字典”，把他从图书馆调到经济思想史组搞研究，甚至还炮制了一个所谓“评功摆好”，给林里夫“送功”。
    一九六○年，我所精简机构时，孙冶方还强行保留了几个有重大政治嫌疑和历史罪恶的人。此后，他又亲自出马，到处搜罗牛鬼蛇神。除了上面提到的右派分子顾准外，孙冶方还坚持要把一个文化特务收罗来所，后经上级制止，未能得逞。
    从以上几个例子中就可以看出，孙冶方所纠集的是一支对党和社会主义怀着刻骨仇恨的反革命队伍。他们结成一伙，放出一批又一批的毒草，射出一支又一支的毒箭，向党中央、毛主席和三面红旗猖狂进攻。
    孙冶方是一个彻头彻尾的修正主义的急先锋，也是一个招降纳叛的罪魁祸首。建国以来，他在历次运动中，都以一手遮天、欺上瞒下的手法，滑过关去。直到这次伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，在毛泽东思想的阳光照耀下，他才完全暴露了原形。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把经济学界的一切牛鬼蛇神揪出来，斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，夺回无产阶级的阵地。
