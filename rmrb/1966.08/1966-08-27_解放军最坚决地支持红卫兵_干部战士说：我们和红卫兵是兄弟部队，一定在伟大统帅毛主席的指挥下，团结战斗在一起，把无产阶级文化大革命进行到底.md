The PLA most resolutely supports the Red Guards. Cadres and soldiers say: We and the Red Guards are brotherly troops. We will definitely, under the command of the great helmsman Chairman Mao, unite and fight together to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 26th, in recent days, the broad masses of cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army have held discussion meetings, written letters, and articles, expressing their most enthusiastic and resolute support for the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards. They say: The Red Guards wear red armbands, we wear red epaulettes, the supreme commander and supreme helmsman are both Chairman Mao. We will definitely, under the command of the great helmsman Chairman Mao, unite and fight together, and swear to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The revolutionary spirit and actions of the Red Guards have been highly praised by the broad masses of cadres and soldiers. Soldiers from a certain unit wrote a poem in praise: "Well done, that's right, smash the old world to pieces! Billions of workers, peasants, and soldiers cheer, long live Mao Zedong Thought!" The unit where the great communist warrior Liu Yingjun was previously stationed wrote in a letter to the Beijing Red Guards: You use the revolutionary iron fist to smash the remnants of feudalism, use the revolutionary broom to sweep away the poison of capitalism, and use the revolutionary broadsword to cut off the roots of revisionism! This makes the great capital of our motherland—Beijing—radiate the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought. In the name of the close comrade of Liu Yingjun, we most resolutely and enthusiastically support your revolutionary actions.

Many old Red Army soldiers, with their personal experiences of following Chairman Mao in revolution, explained that the revolutionary rebel spirit of the Red Guards is completely correct. They said, without the rebellion of the revolutionary people in the past, there would be no new society today; similarly, without the rebellion of the revolutionary masses today against all the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes, the old world cannot be thoroughly destroyed, and a brilliant new world of the proletariat cannot be established. In an article by a certain unit's old Red Army soldier Wang Shian, it is written: Today, the revolutionary rebel spirit and actions of the Red Guards are precisely the inheritance and development of the revolutionary rebel spirit of the older generation of revolutionaries. With this spirit, we can build socialist China into an iron-clad fortress of the proletariat that will never change color.

Many cadres and soldiers in the units, while studying the editorial "Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Must Resolutely Support Revolutionary Students" published in the People's Daily, also studied Chairman Mao's relevant works.

The broad masses of cadres and soldiers have also unanimously expressed that they will further study the Sixteen Points, use the Sixteen Points as a weapon, resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, thoroughly smash the old world, and establish a new world of the proletariat, letting the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly high over all ideological battlefields and forever wave proudly.

    解放军最坚决地支持红卫兵
    干部战士说：我们和红卫兵是兄弟部队，一定在伟大统帅毛主席的指挥下，团结战斗在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底
    据新华社二十六日讯　连日来，人民解放军广大指战员纷纷开座谈会、写信、写文章，对红卫兵的革命行动，表示最热烈最坚决的支持。他们说：红卫兵戴红袖章，我们戴红领章，最高司令、最高统帅都是毛主席。我们一定在伟大统帅毛主席的指挥下，团结战斗在一起，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    红卫兵的革命精神和行动，受到广大指战员的热烈赞扬。某部战士们写诗赞道：“做得好，做得对，把旧世界彻底来砸碎！亿万工农兵齐欢呼，毛泽东思想万万岁！”伟大共产主义战士刘英俊生前所在连队，在写给北京红卫兵的信中说，你们用革命的铁拳猛砸封建主义的残余，用革命的铁扫帚横扫资本主义的毒菌，用革命的大刀阔斧猛砍修正主义的老根！使伟大祖国的首都——北京，放射出毛泽东思想的万丈光芒。我们以刘英俊同志的亲密战友的名义，最坚决最热烈地支持你们的革命行动。
    许多红军老战士，以他们跟着毛主席闹革命的亲身经历，说明红卫兵小将们的革命造反精神完全正确。他们说，没有当年革命人民的造反，就没有今天的新社会；同样，没有今天革命群众对一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯的造反，就不能彻底摧毁旧世界，建立起光辉灿烂的无产阶级的新世界。某部红军老战士王世安的文章中写道：今天，红卫兵小将们的这种革命造反精神和行动，正是老一辈革命者的革命造反精神的继承和发扬。有了这种精神，才能把社会主义的中国建设成为无产阶级的铁打江山，永不变色。
    许多部队指战员在学习《人民日报》发表的《工农兵要坚决支持革命学生》的社论时，还结合学习了毛主席的有关著作。
    广大指战员们还一致表示，要进一步学习十六条，以十六条为武器，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，彻底砸烂旧世界，建立起无产阶级的新世界，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍一切思想阵地，永远高高飘扬。
