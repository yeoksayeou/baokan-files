An Unforgettable Night on Duty

In the afternoon of August 13th, we listened to the broadcast of the communiqué of the 11th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party with hearts full of excitement and joy. Every sentence in the communiqué made us feel as if we were personally hearing the voice of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. We could not contain our inner joy and repeatedly raised our arms to shout, “Long live the Communist Party of China!” “Long live our beloved leader Chairman Mao!” We sang “The East Is Red” and “Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman” over and over again with all our hearts.

On this night of duty, the phone calls were unusually frequent: there were calls from headquarters and units, from border outposts, from main forces, and also from people's armed forces and militia units. One call after another, all directed to newspapers, Xinhua News Agency, and military leadership organizations. Some calls from remote areas had very faint voices, so we coordinated with the switchboard operators at various intermediate exchanges, passing the messages sentence by sentence. Truly, thousands and tens of thousands of people had one heart, and thousands and tens of thousands of words had one voice. All the calls expressed one common sentiment: resolute support for the communiqué of the Party Central Committee! Warmly celebrating the new developments and victories of Mao Zedong Thought! All the calls showed one ironclad resolve: resolutely responding to the great call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we will forever follow Chairman Mao in making revolution, and we will definitely carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat and the socialist revolution to the end!

In this night of universal jubilation, the phone calls were several times, even ten times, more than usual. We, the few telephone operators, seemed to suddenly become more intelligent, more quick-witted, and swiftly and accurately transferred all the calls. All the users, after finishing a call, would always say to us, “Thank you.” We did not have time to reply, but in our hearts, we thanked the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao every time. We thanked our beloved leader Chairman Mao for pointing out the revolutionary path and direction for us!

　　难忘的值班之夜
　　昆明部队长途电话站　蒋立年　严德芬　李巧云　王社平
    十三日下午五时，我们怀着无比兴奋、无比激动的心情，收听了党的八届十一中全会公报的广播。公报的每一句话，都使我们好像亲自听到了党中央的声音，听到了毛主席的声音。我们抑制不住内心的欢乐，一次又一次地振臂高呼：“中国共产党万岁！”“敬爱的领袖毛主席万岁！”一遍又一遍地纵情歌唱《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》。
    我们值班的这一个夜晚，电话格外的多：有来自机关、连队的，有来自边防哨所的；有来自主力部队的，也有来自人民武装部门和民兵单位的，一个又一个的电话，都是通往报社、新华社和部队领导机关的。有些来自边远地区的电话，声音很小，我们就和各个中途总机的值班员配合起来，一句一句地接力传送，真是千人万人一条心，千言万语一个音。所有的电话都表达了一个共同的声音：坚决拥护党中央的公报！热烈欢呼毛泽东思想的新发展、新胜利！所有的电话都表示了一个钢铁般的决心：坚决响应党中央和毛主席的伟大号召，我们永远跟着毛主席闹革命，誓把无产阶级文化大革命和社会主义革命进行到底！
    在这万众欢腾的不眠之夜，电话比平时多了几倍，乃至十倍；我们这几个电话员，好象突然变得更加聪明、更加眼明手快了，迅速、准确地接转了所有的电话。所有的用户，在讲完一个电话之后，总要对我们说一句：“谢谢你们。”我们来不及回话，可是，我们在心里每次都要感谢党中央，感谢毛主席。感谢敬爱的领袖毛主席为我们指引了革命的道路和方向！　（据新华社昆明十五日电）
