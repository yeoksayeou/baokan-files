	I said that all the reactionaries who speak of being powerful are merely paper tigers. The reason is that they are detached from the people. Look, wasn't Hitler a paper tiger? Wasn't Hitler overthrown? I also mentioned that the Tsar was a paper tiger, the Chinese emperor was a paper tiger, Japanese imperialism was a paper tiger. Look, they all fell. The U.S. imperialists have not fallen yet, they still have atomic bombs, but I think they will fall too, they are also paper tigers.

    毛主席语录
    我说一切所有号称强大的反动派统统不过是纸老虎。原因是他们脱离人民。你看，希特勒是不是纸老虎？希特勒不是被打倒了吗？我也谈到沙皇是纸老虎，中国皇帝是纸老虎，日本帝国主义是纸老虎，你看，都倒了。美帝国主义没有倒，还有原子弹，我看也是要倒的，也是纸老虎。
