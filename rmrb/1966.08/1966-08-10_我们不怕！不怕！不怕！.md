We are not afraid! Not afraid! Not afraid!

Dear Party Central Committee, beloved Chairman Mao: Your wise decision has bolstered our spirits and strengthened our resolve! It proves that our rebellion against the bourgeoisie is right and just. The cause of the proletarian revolution will be carried on by us, and the future edifice will be built by us. Dear Party, beloved Chairman Mao! With your leadership and support, the task of liberating humanity will surely be undertaken by our red generation! With the great Mao Zedong Thought, we are full of confidence, our fighting spirit is soaring, our spirits are invigorated, and we march forward bravely!

Today, you have made this great decision, which is a manifestation of the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. It is the compass of the current proletarian cultural revolution, the steering wheel and telescope in our complex class struggle, the timely rain in our revolutionary struggle, and a new victory for Mao Zedong Thought!

The voice of the Party Central Committee reaches us, and instantly, our hearts surge with emotion, and our blood boils! How can we not be deeply moved? In the days of towering waves, in the midst of ever-changing class struggles, we have longed to see the red light of Zhongnanhai, and we have longed to hear the Party tell us: you have done right.

On the tumultuous sea, only the seagull dares to soar, on the precipitous cliffs, only the eagle dares to circle. Revolutionaries are even more daring than seagulls and eagles. The bourgeois "masters" shoot us with poisoned arrows, spread rumors, are cunning, evasive, and counterattack with all their might. Bourgeois "masters," bring out all your tricks, we are not afraid, not afraid, not afraid! We will wield the thousand-catty club of Mao Zedong Thought, sweep away all ghosts and monsters, overthrow all reactionary elements, and create a new world of communism.

The red sun rises high above Tiananmen Gate, illuminating everyone's heart.

Greatest Chairman Mao, your good students and soldiers pledge to you: We will read your books for a lifetime, listen to your words for a lifetime, and act according to your instructions for a lifetime. We will surely defend the red proletarian state to the end and will plant the red flag of your great thought all over the world!

    我们不怕！不怕！不怕！
    亲爱的党中央，敬爱的毛主席：您的英明决定长了我们的志气！撑了我们的腰！证明我们对资产阶级造反，造得对，造得有理。无产阶级的革命事业由我们来接，未来的大厦由我们来建。亲爱的党啊，敬爱的毛主席！有您的领导，有您的支持，人类解放的任务，我们红色的一代一定承担！有了伟大的毛泽东思想，我们信心百倍，斗志昂扬，精神抖擞，勇往直前！
    今天，您作出这个伟大的决定，正是毛泽东思想光辉的体现，它是当前无产阶级文化大革命的指南针，是我们在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中的方向盘、望远镜，是我们在革命斗争中的“及时雨”，是毛泽东思想的新胜利！
    党中央的声音传来，顿时，我们心潮澎湃，热血沸腾！我们怎能不万分激动呢，在大浪滔天的日子里，在风云多变的阶级斗争中，我们多么渴望见到中南海的红灯，我们多么希望能够听到党告诉我们：你们做对了。
    怒浪滔天的海面上，只有海燕才敢翱翔，险峻陡峭的山崖，只有山鹰才敢盘旋，革命者比海燕和山鹰更勇猛。资产阶级“老爷”们对我们放暗箭，造谣言，狡猾，抵赖，反扑，无所不用其极。资产阶级“老爷”们，你们有多少伎俩都拿出来吧，我们不怕，不怕，不怕！我们要挥起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，打倒一切反动的东西，创出一个共产主义新世界。
    红太阳从天安门上高高升起，红太阳照亮了每个人的心。
    最最伟大的毛主席啊，您的好学生、好战士，向您宣誓：我们一定读一辈子您的书，听一辈子您的话，一辈子按您的指示办事，一定把红色的无产阶级江山保到底，一定要把您的伟大的思想红旗插遍全球！
