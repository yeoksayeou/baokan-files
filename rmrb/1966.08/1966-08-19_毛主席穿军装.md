	Chairman Mao in Military Uniform

	On the Tiananmen Gate Tower,
	With rays of light in all directions,
	A red sun shines brightly in the sky,
	With shouts of joy and waves of people,
	The sea of people surges,
	Millions of red flags flutter,
	Millions of brave soldiers raise their fists high,
	In unison, they cheer,
	Chairman Mao has come in military uniform!

	The PLA soldiers smile with tears of happiness,
	The militiamen smile with tears of happiness,
	The Red Guards smile with tears of happiness,
	All the people of the nation are soldiers,
	All smile with uncontrollable tears of happiness...

	Chairman Mao,
	Our great commander, wise leader.
	Over thirty years ago,
	You put on the military uniform,
	And founded the Red Army,
	The flames of armed struggle you ignited burned across China!

	Chairman Mao,
	Our great commander, wise leader.
	During the War of Resistance Against Japan,
	You put on the military uniform,
	And led the military and civilians in the resistance,
	And annihilated the Japanese fascist invaders!

	Chairman Mao,
	Our great commander, wise leader.
	During the Third Revolutionary Civil War,
	You put on the military uniform,
	And led the people of the nation,
	And overthrew the Chiang Kai-shek regime!

	Now, our most beloved Chairman Mao,
	You have put on the military uniform again,
	And lead us to defend our country's mountains and rivers,
	If the enemy dares to invade, we will bury it completely!

	On the Tiananmen Gate Tower,
	With rays of light in all directions,
	A red sun shines brightly in the sky,
	With shouts of joy and waves of people,
	The sea of people surges,
	Millions of red flags flutter,
	The people of the nation raise their fists high,
	In unison, they cheer,
	The warmest cheers,
	Our Chairman Mao has come in military uniform!
