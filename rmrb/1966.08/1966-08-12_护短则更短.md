    In 1964, during the evaluation of the "Four Good" campaign, from soldiers to officers, people openly criticized me by name. Hearing so many criticisms from the masses, my heart burned with discomfort. These criticisms weighed heavily on me, making it hard to walk with my head held high, to eat, or to sleep. The more I thought about it, the more confused I became.

    With the criticisms from the masses in mind, I repeatedly studied "In Service of the People." This time, the reading felt particularly close to my heart. Especially the part where it says: "Since we are serving the people, we should not be afraid of criticism. No matter who points out our mistakes, we should welcome it. As long as you are correct, we will correct our mistakes. If your suggestions benefit the people, we will follow them." Chairman Mao's words rang in my mind like a bell, helping me finally realize: no matter how many mistakes I made, the root of the problem was that I approached criticism from a personal perspective of gain and loss.

    Chairman Mao said: "Any party, any individual, will inevitably make mistakes. We only ask that they make fewer mistakes. If mistakes are made, they should be corrected, and the quicker and more thoroughly they are corrected, the better." I studied and thought, thought and studied, pondering over it repeatedly. For a long time, I could not accept any criticism. The masses had no choice but to keep their criticisms to themselves, and the more they accumulated, the more severe my flaws became, resulting in protecting flaws only making them worse. The correct attitude is to humbly accept the masses' criticisms, dare to expose flaws, and bravely correct them. Whether one can accept the masses' criticisms is not only a measure of a cadre's democratic style but also a reflection of one's level of consciousness. Without a wholehearted commitment to serving the people, one cannot sincerely promote democracy; without a high sense of responsibility to the revolution, one cannot accept the masses' criticisms. Reflecting on all this, I realized that it was not the fault of the masses for having so many criticisms but my own low level of consciousness. Once my thoughts were clear, my burden was lifted, and my mood improved. I decided, as Chairman Mao taught, to correct my mistakes quickly and thoroughly.

    During a life discussion meeting, comrades had many criticisms about the sand in the food. The reason for the sand was that the well water was too shallow, and sand from the bottom of the well was brought up with the water. To ensure that everyone would no longer eat food with sand, I decided to clean the well. This was in line with Chairman Mao's teachings on caring for the people's lives and was also an action to correct my mistakes. During the joint labor, some comrades were concerned that I might get cold and brought me a raincoat; others were worried that I might get injured and taught me how to prevent cave-ins. The comrades' care made me feel warm at heart, and I did not feel the cold at all. This well-cleaning not only solved the sand problem but also gave me another lesson, washing away old thoughts and strengthening class feelings.

    Through this revolution in my thinking, I deeply felt that: in the past, I had so many flaws in my work, and comrades had so many criticisms of me, because I did not listen to Chairman Mao's words. Now, comrades say I have done the right thing, because I listened to Chairman Mao's words. The facts once again prove: to be a revolutionary for a lifetime, one must listen to Chairman Mao's words for a lifetime.

　　护短则更短
　　解放军某部指导员　周永胜
    一九六四年四好总评，从战士到干部，指名道姓地给我提了很多意见。听到群众这么多的意见，心里火辣辣地难受。这些意见压得我走路抬不起头，吃饭咽不下口，休息睡不着觉，越想越不通。
    带着群众的批评意见，我反复学习了《为人民服务》。这次读起来特别亲切。尤其是读到：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。你说的办法对人民有好处，我们就照你的办。”毛主席的这段话象洪钟一样在我的脑子里当当响。使我终于认识到：千错万错，就错在自己从个人得失出发来对待批评。
    毛主席说：“任何政党，任何个人，错误总是难免的，我们要求犯得少一点。犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好。”我学了想，想了学，反复琢磨。过去很长一段时间，我什么意见也听不进去，群众只得把意见积在心里，越积意见越多，而自己的缺点却越来越严重，结果是护短则更短。正确的态度，是虚心听取群众的意见，敢于揭露缺点，勇于改正缺点。能不能听取群众的意见，不光是衡量一个干部民主作风的问题，也是一个人觉悟高低的表现。缺乏全心全意为人民服务的思想，就不可能诚心诚意地发扬民主；没有对革命高度负责的精神，就听不进群众的意见。想来想去，不怪大家提的意见多，只怪自己觉悟低。思想通了，包袱放下了，心情也就愉快了。我决心象毛主席教导的那样：迅速改正、彻底改正。
    在一次生活座谈会上，同志们对饭菜里沙子多很有意见。沙子多的原因是井里水太浅，打水时把井底的沙子带上来了。为了让大家不再吃带沙子的饭菜，我决心下水淘井。这是执行毛主席关心群众生活的教导，也是我改正错误的一个行动。在共同劳动中，有的同志怕我冻着，给我送来雨衣；有的同志怕我砸着，交代我防塌方的方法。同志们的关怀，使我心里热乎乎的，一点不觉得冷。这次淘井不但解决了沙子问题，而且使自己又受到一次教育，淘洗了一次旧思想，增强了阶级感情。
    经过这次思想上的革命，我深深地体会到：以前我在工作中有那么多缺点，同志们对我意见多，是因为我没有听毛主席的话。现在同志们说我作对了，是因为我听了毛主席的话。事实又一次证明：干一辈子革命，就必须一辈子听毛主席的话。
