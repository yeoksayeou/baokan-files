Faculty and students from military academies of the Beijing garrison visited the exhibition on the history of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University and expressed their determination to carry on and promote the fine traditions and revolutionary spirit of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, and to make all military academies of the People's Liberation Army into universities of Mao Zedong Thought in the style of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on August 6, "The Anti-Japanese Military and Political University is a model of Chairman Mao's great idea that the People's Liberation Army should be a great university." This was the unanimous view of the faculty and students from military academies of the Beijing garrison after visiting the exhibition on the history of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University. They expressed their determination to carry on and promote the fine traditions and revolutionary spirit of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, and to make all military academies of the People's Liberation Army into universities of Mao Zedong Thought in the style of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University.

Since August 1, faculty and students from military academies of the Beijing garrison have visited the exhibition on the history of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University. They regard it as a living classroom for studying Mao Zedong Thought and have conducted lively discussions in conjunction with Chairman Mao's recent great call.

Many faculty and students from military academies said in their discussions that the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Students studied politics, military affairs, and culture, spun thread, cultivated wasteland, engaged in agricultural and sideline production, participated in battles, and did mass work at the same time. The Anti-Japanese Military and Political University is a great university for studying, spreading, and arming the broad revolutionary youth with Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, in just nine years, it trained and fostered more than ten thousand revolutionary cadres. A teacher from a certain school said in the discussion that Chairman Mao has long taught us that the army is not only a fighting force but also a working force and a production force. Chairman Mao recently instructed that the People's Liberation Army should be a great university. The Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, which was personally founded by Chairman Mao, is run according to these instructions of Chairman Mao. It is the direction for all military academies.

A model student from a certain advanced specialized school of the Air Force, Lü Lirén, said, "After visiting the exhibition on the history of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, the direction for implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions has become clearer. That is to make our school into a university of Mao Zedong Thought in the style of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University. We are the children of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants. We must follow the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao, become students of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University style who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and become successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution."

Faculty and students from the Logistics Academy, a certain advanced specialized school of the Air Force, a certain military equipment school, the nursing school of the General Hospital of the People's Liberation Army, and other military academies of the Beijing garrison, as well as some responsible cadres from naval academies attending a meeting in Beijing, visited the exhibition on the history of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University. They took the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University as an example and reviewed the situation of implementing Chairman Mao's educational line in their own academies. Everyone agreed that the fundamental task of the school is to arm the students with Mao Zedong Thought and to train and foster successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution. Whether it is political courses or professional courses, they must emphasize politics, just like the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, and use the works of Chairman Mao as the basic textbooks.

    抗大是所有军事院校的方向
    驻京部队军事院校教职学员参观抗大校史展览，表示要继承和发扬抗大的优良传统和革命作风，把我军院校都办成抗大式的毛泽东思想大学校。
    据新华社六日讯　“抗大就是体现了毛主席关于人民解放军应该是一个大学校伟大思想的典范”，这是驻京部队军事院校教职学员参观抗大校史展览后的一致体会。他们表示，决心继承和发扬抗大的优良传统和革命作风，把我军院校都办成抗大式的毛泽东思想大学校。
    八一以来，驻京部队军事院校的教职学员陆续参观了抗大校史展览，他们把这里当作是学习毛泽东思想的活课堂，并且结合毛主席最近的伟大号召，进行了热烈的座谈讨论。
    许多军事院校的教职学员在座谈时说，抗大把毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得最高，学员们学政治，学军事，学文化，纺线开荒，参加农副业生产，参加打仗，同时又做群众工作。抗大是一所学习毛泽东思想，传播毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想武装广大革命青年的大学校，因而在短短九年里，培养和造就了十多万革命干部。某学校教员在座谈时说，毛主席早就教导我们，军队既是一个战斗队，又是一个工作队，一个生产队。毛主席最近又指示：人民解放军应该是一个大学校。毛主席亲手创建的抗大，就是遵照毛主席的这些指示办的，它是所有军事院校的方向。
    空军某高级专科学校五好学员吕立人说，参观了抗大校史展览，贯彻执行毛主席最新指示的方向更明确了，那就是把我们的学校，办成抗大那样的毛泽东思想大学校。我们是工人、贫下中农的子弟，一定要沿着毛主席指引的方向，做毛泽东思想武装的抗大式的学员，做无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    后勤学院、空军某高级专科学校、某军械学校、人民解放军总医院护士学校等驻京部队院校的部分教职学员，和正在北京开会的海军部分院校负责干部，参观了抗大校史展览，还以抗大为榜样，对照检查了本院校贯彻执行毛主席教育路线的情况，大家一致认为，学校最根本的任务，是用毛泽东思想武装学员，培养和造就无产阶级革命事业的接班人。不论是政治课，还是业务课，都必须突出政治，象抗大那样，以毛主席著作作为基本教材。
