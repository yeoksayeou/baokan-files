	Workers in Northeast China Practice Thrift in Running Enterprises

	In the first half of the year, industrial departments saved more than 100 million tons of coal, over 300 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, and a large amount of steel, timber, and other materials.

	According to Xinhua News Agency in Shenyang, the broad masses of workers on the industrial front in Northeast China have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. In the production struggle, they have firmly carried out the Party's policy of building the country through thrift and running enterprises through thrift. They have launched a mass movement for increased production and economy, not only surpassing the production plan but also achieving remarkable results in saving materials.

	According to incomplete statistics from the provinces of Jilin, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang, in the first half of this year, the entire region's industrial departments saved more than 100 million tons of coal, over 300 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, and a large amount of steel, timber, and other important materials.

	This year's movement for increased production and economy has yielded even greater political gains. Chairman Mao's instructions on increasing production, practicing economy, and building the country through thrift, as well as the Party's glorious tradition of self-reliance and hard struggle, have taken deeper root in the minds of the broad masses of workers. Through the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, workers' understanding of increased production and economy has reached a new level. They say that increased production and economy are not merely economic tasks but, more importantly, political tasks. They are a struggle to eliminate bourgeois ideology and promote proletarian ideology, a major issue concerning the revolutionization of people and enterprises.

　　东北职工勤俭办企业
    上半年工业部门节约煤炭一百多万吨、三亿多度电和大量钢材、木材等物资
    据新华社沈阳电　东北地区工业战线广大职工，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在生产斗争中坚定不移地执行党的勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的方针，开展了群众性的增产节约运动，不仅超额完成生产计划，而且在节约物资方面取得显著成绩。
    据吉林、辽宁、黑龙江三省的不完全统计，今年上半年全区工业部门节约了煤炭一百多万吨，电力三亿多度和大量钢材、木材等重要物资。
    今年的增产节约运动，在政治上的收获更大。毛主席关于增加生产、厉行节约、勤俭建国的指示和党的自力更生、艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，在广大职工思想中进一步地扎下根。职工们通过活学活用毛主席著作，对增产节约的认识又有新的提高。他们说，增产节约不是单纯的经济任务，更重要的是政治任务，是大灭资产阶级思想、大兴无产阶级思想的斗争，是关系到人的革命化、企业革命化的大问题。
