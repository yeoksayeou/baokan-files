Japanese Socialist Party National Assembly Delegation Shares Impressions of Their Visit to China: The Great Cultural Revolution Guided by Mao Zedong Thought is Unprecedentedly Great

According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, August 24th - The Japanese Socialist Party National Assembly Delegation recently shared their impressions of visiting China with our reporters.

The Japanese friends mentioned that the most profound experience from this visit was the greatness of Mao Zedong Thought. The leader of the delegation, who is visiting China for the first time, Tate Kazuyoshi said: "Mao Zedong Thought is unprecedentedly great. It is not something that a university graduate or a scholar could come up with, nor is it something that anyone could conjure up out of thin air. It is the result of Chairman Mao's lifelong dedication to the liberation revolutionary movement, enduring countless hardships, and long-term revolutionary struggle, research, and consolidation. Because of this, it has gained the support of 700 million Chinese people and has been thoroughly implemented in China. The 700 million Chinese people are all willing to follow Chairman Mao."

Team member Kashiwa Yasuo said: "When studying Chairman Mao's works, I felt that what he said was not just theoretical, but very practical, and he explained the problems very accurately, with many points worth deep reflection."

Fujita Takatoshi said: "As the saying goes, seeing is believing. There are many things in China that are difficult to understand without coming to see for oneself. In China, after nearly fifty years of struggle, Chairman Mao's correct leadership, correct theories, correct policies, and thoughts have taken root among the masses. Therefore, whenever the Communist Party of China proposes a policy, the masses immediately implement it, which is very natural." Kashiwa Yasuo also said: "I also feel that just hearing about how great Mao Zedong Thought is not enough; one must interact with the masses. We visited factories, communes, barracks, and schools and saw that the masses study Chairman Mao's works not because of pressure from above, but voluntarily. After seeing this, I had a correct understanding of China's movement to study Chairman Mao's works."

The delegation saw the vigorous scenes of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution wherever they went, leaving a deep impression. Tate Kazuyoshi said: "The Cultural Revolution guided by Mao Zedong Thought can be said to be an unprecedentedly great undertaking since the existence of the Earth and human history. We saw students debating how to reform the educational system, tens of thousands of workers marching and debating in the streets, making it very lively. During our visits, we found that in China, people regard consolidating state power as the top priority. Indeed, this is the case. Once the foundation of the state is solid, the speed of construction can be faster. Chinese students have reformed the educational system well, making one year of study equivalent to three years of study abroad. China places great emphasis on highlighting politics, which has given me a great inspiration." Fujita Takatoshi said: "The characteristic of this great revolution in the ideological realm is that it is guided by Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly implementing the mass line and relying on the workers, peasants, and soldiers to carry it out. The reason this can be done is that China's power has a solid foundation."

Kashiwa Yasuo, while visiting the "Rent Collection Courtyard" clay sculpture, said: "Here, I saw Chinese youth receiving profound education from the history of class struggle, which deeply moved me. Such moving scenes were also encountered in conversations with workers, peasants, and the People's Liberation Army. Therefore, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, relying on the great power of workers, peasants, and soldiers, has great significance. I firmly believe that China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will definitely succeed."

Kashiwa Yasuo also believed: Some people say that China's Cultural Revolution is "destroying culture," which itself seems strange. He said: "In my understanding, culture that does not adapt to China's current socialist economic base must be transformed. Excellent elements from ancient China and foreign countries should be inherited, while the bad ones should be transformed. In this process, socialist new culture will be created."

Kashiwa Yasuo finally said: "The most important thing is that 700 million Chinese people are all armed with Mao Zedong Thought, which is the strongest force, the greatest preparation for war, and also what American imperialism fears the most."

    日本社会党国会议员访华团发表访华观感
    毛泽东思想指导的文化大革命空前伟大
    据新华社南宁二十四日电　日本社会党国会议员访华团，最近对本社记者发表访问中国的观感。
    日本朋友谈到，这次访问我国体会最深的，是毛泽东思想的伟大。第一次访问我国的团长楯兼次郎说：“毛泽东思想是空前伟大的思想。它并不是大学毕业的秀才能够想得出来的，也不是什么人凭空想出来的。它是毛主席毕生投身于解放革命运动，历尽千辛万苦，经过长期革命斗争、研究、集中起来的。正因为这样，它才得到七亿中国人民的支持，在中国得到了彻底的贯彻。七亿中国人民都愿意跟着毛主席走。”
    团员楢崎弥之助说：“在学习毛主席著作时，我感到他所说的不是本本上的东西，而是很实际的问题，而且把问题讲得非常准确，有很多是值得我们深思的”。
    藤田高敏说：“俗话说，百闻不如一见。中国有很多事情，不亲自来看一看，确是难于理解的。在中国，经过近五十年的斗争，毛主席的正确领导、正确理论、正确的政策和思想已经在群众中扎下了根，因此，每当中国共产党提出一个政策，群众就马上执行，这是很自然的。”楢崎弥之助也说：“我还感到，光听说毛泽东思想如何伟大还不够，必须同群众接触。我们参观了工厂、公社、兵营、学校，看到群众学习毛主席著作并不是由于有从上而下的压力，而是自觉自愿地开展学习、讨论。看了以后，对中国这一学习毛主席著作的运动，才有了正确的理解。”
    访华团在所到之处，都看到了我国无产阶级文化大革命的轰轰烈烈的场面，印象很深。楯兼次郎说：“以毛泽东思想为指导的文化大革命，可以说是自有地球以来、自有人类历史以来空前未有的伟大事业。我们看到了在运动中，学生就如何改革教育制度的问题开展大辩论，几万工人上街游行、辩论，搞得很热闹。我们在参观访问中发现，在中国，人们把巩固国家政权看作是第一位的。其实也是这样，国家的基础打牢固了，建设速度就可能更快。中国学生把教育制度改革搞好了，一年的学习，顶得过外国学生学三年。中国非常强调突出政治，使我受到很大启发。”藤田高敏说：“这场思想领域的大革命的特点，是以毛泽东思想为指导，彻底地贯彻了群众路线，依靠工农兵群众来进行的。之所以能够这样做，说明中国的政权有着巩固的基础。”楢崎弥之助在参观泥塑“收租院”时说：“我在这里看到中国少年从阶级斗争的历史中，受到了深刻教育，深为感动。这种动人的场面，在同工人、农民、解放军交谈中，也都遇见过。因此，文化大革命依靠工农兵的伟大力量，具有伟大的意义。我深信，中国的文化大革命一定会成功。”
    楢崎弥之助还认为：有人说中国进行文化大革命是在“消灭文化”，这种提法本身就很叫人感到奇怪。他说：“照我理解，不适应于中国今天社会主义经济基础的文化，当然要改造。中国古代的和外国的东西，优秀的要继承，不好的要改造，就在这过程中，来创造社会主义的新文化。”
    楢崎弥之助最后说：“最重要的是七亿中国人民人人都用毛泽东思想武装起来，这才是最强大的力量，是最大的战备，也是美帝国主义最害怕的。”
