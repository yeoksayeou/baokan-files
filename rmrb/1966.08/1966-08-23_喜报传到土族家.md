On the morning of the 20th, the cultural work team from Qinghai Province's Huzhu Tu Autonomous County arrived at the Tu ethnic community in Chengguan Commune's Gucheng Brigade's Xiaozhuang Production Team. They propagated the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and spread the joyous news of Chairman Mao's meeting with a million revolutionary masses at Tiananmen Square. The entire village's members, supporting the elderly and leading the young, rushed from all directions, and soon the threshing ground was filled with a joyful crowd.

The cultural work team members performed more than ten programs rich in national and local flavors. During the performance of the Qinghai folk song "Celebrating Chairman Mao's Reception of a Million Revolutionary Masses," which they had hastily written the night before, the actors sang passionately:

	On the morning of the 18th of August,
	Red flags flutter at Tiananmen Square,
	A million revolutionary masses hold a meeting,
	The song of victory in the cultural revolution is sung loudly.
	The Chairman wears a cotton uniform,
	The red star on his cap shines with golden light,
	The Chairman shakes hands and greets the masses,
	The masses' cheers grow louder and louder....

The actors' passionate singing and the villagers' applause and cheers blended together. After watching the performance, the Tu villagers were filled with boundless love, faith, and admiration for Chairman Mao. They excitedly said: We must now study and apply Chairman Mao's works more diligently, eliminate all feudal superstitions and bourgeois old customs and habits, and resolutely carry out the revolution and production well.

Since its establishment last year, the cultural work team of Huzhu Tu Autonomous County has always insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively. They often go to the countryside and mountains to perform. Not long ago, they traveled through mountains and rivers to the border of Qinghai and Gansu provinces in the Qilian Mountains, performing for the local Tu, Tibetan, Hui, and other ethnic minority farmers and herdsmen. Sometimes they would perform two or three shows in a day. Just a few days ago, they returned from a touring performance in the mountains, covered in dust, and immediately threw themselves into a new battle.

    喜报传到土族家
    二十日清晨，青海省互助土族自治县文化工作队来到了土族聚居的城关公社古城大队小庄生产队，向社员们宣传党的八届十一中全会公报，传播毛主席在天安门会见百万革命群众的喜讯。全村社员扶老携幼，从四面八方赶来，顿时打麦场上挤满了欢乐的人群。
    文化工作队员们一连演出了十几个富有民族和地方色彩的节目。在演出他们连夜编写的青海道情《欢呼毛主席接见百万革命群众》时，演员满腔热情地高声唱道：
    八月十八一清早，
    天安门广场红旗飘，
    百万革命群众开大会，
    庆祝文化革命胜利的歌声高。
    主席身着布军装，
    红星帽徽闪金光，
    主席和群众握手又问好，
    群众的欢呼声一浪更比一浪高。……
    演员激情的歌声和社员们的鼓掌声、欢呼声交织在一起。土族社员们看了演出后，充满了对毛主席的无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜的心情。他们激动地说：我们今后更要活学活用毛主席著作，破除一切封建迷信和资产阶级的旧风俗、旧习惯，坚决把革命和生产搞好。
    互助土族自治县文化工作队，从去年建队以来，始终坚持活学活用毛主席著作，经常下乡上山巡回演出。不久前，他们曾跋山涉水，奔赴青、甘两省交界线上的祁连山中，为当地的土、藏、回等少数民族农牧民演出，有时一天要演出两三场。前几天，他们风尘仆仆地刚从山区巡回演出归来，马上又投入了新的战斗。　新华社记者
