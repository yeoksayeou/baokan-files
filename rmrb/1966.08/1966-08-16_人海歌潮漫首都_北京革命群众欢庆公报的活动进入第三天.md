The revolutionary masses of the capital have entered the third day of celebrating the publication of the Party's Eighth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. The city is in high spirits, with people expressing their joy in waves of cheers. They praise the great Party and the great leader Chairman Mao for their wise leadership, and celebrate the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

In the morning, the streets were filled with a sea of people singing, pouring in from all directions towards the Party Central. Congratulatory teams gathered into dozens of columns, stretching from Tiananmen in the east to Xidan in the west, filling half of Chang'an Avenue. After noon, people continued to parade in the rain. The heavier the rain, the higher the spirits, and the louder the drumbeats. Students in the rain recited Chairman Mao's quotations in unison: "Overcome all difficulties, strive for victory." Many women on the streets also held copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," reciting them while waiting to convey their congratulations. At the reception station of the Party Central, the sound of firecrackers, drums, and cheers shook the heavens. Even at night, people continued to come to convey their congratulations in the rain.

Among the endless stream of workers conveying their congratulations, many were just off work. They didn't have time to change out of their work clothes or eat dinner before joining the congratulatory teams. The workers said: Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country are doing things that previous generations dared not do or even think of. Now, the Party has sounded the charge for us to strive for greater victories. Whatever Chairman Mao says, whatever the Party Central says, we will resolutely carry out. We will dare to climb mountains of knives and walk through seas of fire. We will definitely always put politics in command, carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, strive for the victorious realization of the Third Five-Year Plan, and build our country into a powerful socialist state.

Many revolutionary workers in printing factories expressed to the Party Central and Chairman Mao: They will definitely, with greater political enthusiasm and the greatest revolutionary spirit, do everything possible to print and distribute Chairman Mao's works well, and deliver them to the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers across the country as soon as possible, so that they can grasp the invincible spiritual atomic bomb of Mao Zedong Thought.

The loudspeakers at the reception station often broadcast the clear voices of children. Countless children, nurtured under the sun of Mao Zedong Thought, also expressed their firm support for the Party Central's communiqué and their determination to be good children of Chairman Mao. Among them, the youngest were only three or four years old, and the oldest were over ten.

Tens of thousands of bright-eyed and warm-hearted "Red Scarves" sang "The Boat Needs a Helmsman" and came to the reception station, swearing in front of Chairman Mao's portrait: They will definitely read Chairman Mao's books and listen to Chairman Mao's words, and become successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the suburbs of Beijing, who are currently studying Chairman Mao's works, continue to send their representatives today from the foot of the Western Hills and the banks of the Yongding River to the reception station of the Party Central. The entire Party members, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary cadres of Xiaojing Village, Luguqiao People's Commune, expressed in their letter of congratulation to the Party Central and Chairman Mao that the communiqué is a new development and a new great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

　　人海歌潮漫首都
　　北京革命群众欢庆公报的活动进入第三天
    首都革命群众欢呼党的八届十一中全会公报发表的庆祝活动进入了第三天，全城欢腾的情绪越来越高。人们千言万语，迸发为一阵阵的欢呼，欢呼伟大的党、伟大的领袖毛主席的英明领导，欢呼毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    清晨，人海歌潮就出现在街头，从四面八方涌向党中央所在地。贺喜的队伍汇集成十几路纵队，东至天安门，西至西单，排满了半条长安街。中午以后，人们一直冒雨游行庆祝。雨越大，情绪越高，鼓声越响。学生们在大雨里齐声朗读毛主席语录：“排除万难，去争取胜利”。许多街道妇女也是人手一册《毛主席语录》，一边等候报喜，一边朗读语录。在党中央所在地的群众接待站前，鞭炮声、锣鼓声、欢呼声震天动地。入夜，冒雨贺喜的人群仍然络绎不绝。
    在川流不息的工人报喜队伍中，有许多是刚下班的工人，他们工作服顾不上换，晚饭顾不上吃，就兴高采烈地加入贺喜队伍。工人们说：全国人民在毛主席的英明领导下，天天都在做着前人不敢做、不敢想的事。现在，党向我们发出了争取更大胜利的进军号。只要毛主席说的，党中央说的，我们就坚决去办，刀山敢上，火海敢下。我们一定要永远突出政治，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，为胜利实现第三个五年计划，为把我国建设成为一个强大的社会主义国家而奋斗。
    许多印刷厂的革命职工，向党中央和毛主席表示：一定要以更大的政治热情和最大的革命干劲，千方百计地把毛主席著作印好、订好，尽早地送到全国广大工农兵手里，使他们掌握毛泽东思想这个威力无比的精神原子弹。
    接待站的广播喇叭不时传来清脆的童声，许许多多在毛泽东思想阳光哺育下健康成长的少年儿童们，也向党中央、毛主席表达他们坚决拥护党中央公报，坚决做毛主席好孩子的决心。他们当中年岁小的只三四岁，大的十多岁。
    千千万万个心红眼亮的“红领巾”们，高歌《大海航行靠舵手》来到接待站，并在毛主席像前宣誓：一定要读毛主席的书，一定要听毛主席的话，做无产阶级革命事业的红色接班人。
    正在大学毛主席著作的京郊广大贫下中农社员们，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，今天继续派出自己的代表，从西山脚下、永定河畔，来到党中央接待站。芦沟桥人民公社小井大队全体党员、贫下中农、革命干部在送给党中央和毛主席的贺信中，欢呼公报是毛泽东思想的新发展，是毛泽东思想的新的伟大胜利。（据新华社十五日讯）
