Study, Familiarize, and Apply the Sixteen Points

The Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, known as the Sixteen Points, was formulated under the personal direction of Comrade Mao Zedong. The Sixteen Points are imbued with a fundamental spirit: trust the masses, rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and respect the masses' initiative. In other words, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution must be a process where the masses educate themselves and liberate themselves, and it cannot be accomplished through any form of substitution or bureaucratic intervention.

The masses are the masters of our society. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution must rely on the broad masses to rise up and take action.

Can the masses of each school and unit carry out the cultural revolution well? Yes, they can! Every revolutionary teacher, student, and comrade should have a great proletarian ambition. As long as everyone seriously studies, familiarizes themselves with, and applies the Sixteen Points, each school and unit will definitely be able to rely on the masses' own strength to achieve victory in the cultural revolution.

The revolutionary mass movement is a great melting pot. Every revolutionary teacher, student, and comrade must undergo trials and tempering in this melting pot and learn revolutionary skills.

When the revolutionary masses grasp the Sixteen Points, they can clarify the direction of the cultural revolution, distinguish right from wrong in their work, and correctly deploy future actions. We must analyze and judge the problems of the previous phase of the movement based on the Sixteen Points. We need to see what is correct and what is wrong, what methods are correct and what methods are incorrect.

Cultural revolution committees, cultural revolution representative assemblies, and cultural revolution representative congresses are new organizational forms where the masses themselves carry out the cultural revolution under the leadership of the Communist Party. They should be elected in accordance with the provisions of the Sixteen Points, similar to the Paris Commune, with comprehensive elections. Who to elect and how to elect should be fully discussed and debated by the masses for several days. If the elected representatives are unqualified, they can be replaced or removed.

Every school and unit's revolutionary masses should focus their main efforts on carrying out the cultural revolution in their own schools and units. They should learn to analyze the specific conditions of their own schools and units, propose solutions to problems, and create experiences through practice. This is the best support for other schools and units. The cultural revolution in each school and unit can only be carried out by the masses of that school and unit to be successful and effective. We must believe in ourselves and also believe that the revolutionary masses of other schools and units can solve their own problems and liberate themselves.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a struggle that touches people's souls, a struggle of ideas and politics. This struggle should be conducted through ideological means, not through violence. Truth is in the hands of the proletariat. Even against rightist elements of the bourgeoisie, we should use ideological means, not violence. Ideological struggle can fully expose the ugly face of the bourgeois rightists and thoroughly refute their fallacies, isolating them to the greatest extent.

The Sixteen Points are the program for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong, serving as a compass for the revolutionary masses to unify their thoughts and actions.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres firmly support the Sixteen Points. We revolutionary masses must seriously study the Sixteen Points, take up the Sixteen Points as a weapon, and compare them with the actual situation of the movement in our own schools and units. If something aligns with the Sixteen Points, we should continue to follow it. If something does not align with the Sixteen Points, we should correct it. For those responsible who resist the Sixteen Points, we should expose and criticize them.

　　学习十六条，熟悉十六条，运用十六条
    中共中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定，即十六条，是在毛泽东同志亲自主持下制定的。这十六条，贯串着一个基本精神，就是：信任群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，尊重群众的首创精神。就是说，无产阶级文化大革命，只能是群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己，不能采用任何包办代替的办法。
    群众是我们社会的主人。无产阶级文化大革命，要靠广大群众自觉起来，自己动手来做。
    靠本学校、本单位的群众，能不能把文化革命做好？能！每个革命师生，每个革命同志，都应当有无产阶级的雄心壮志。只要大家认真地学习十六条，熟悉十六条，运用十六条，各个学校，各个单位，就一定能够依靠群众自己的力量，取得文化大革命的胜利。
    革命的群众运动，是个大熔炉。每个革命师生，每个革命同志，都要在这个熔炉里，经受考验，得到锻炼，学会革命的本领。
    革命群众掌握了十六条，就可以明确文化革命的方向，辨别工作中的是非，正确部署今后的行动。我们要根据十六条，分析和判断前一段运动的问题。看那些是对的，那些是错的，那些做法是正确的，那些做法是不正确的。
    文化革命小组，文化革命委员会，文化革命代表大会，是在共产党的领导下，群众自己起来进行文化革命的新组织形式。要按照十六条的规定，象巴黎公社那样，实行全面的选举。选什么人，怎么选法，都要经过群众充分酝酿几天，反复讨论几次。被选上的，如果不称职，还可以改选、撤换。
    每个学校、每个单位的革命群众，都要把主要精力，放在搞好本学校、本单位的文化革命上面。学会具体分析本学校、本单位的具体情况，提出解决问题的办法，在实践中亲自创造经验，这就是对其他学校、其他单位的最好支援。每个学校、每个单位的文化革命，只有靠本学校、本单位的群众自己进行，才能搞得开，搞得好。我们要相信自己，也相信其他学校、其他单位的革命群众，是能够自己解决自己的问题的，是能够自己解放自己的。
    无产阶级文化大革命，是一场触及人们灵魂的思想斗争和政治斗争。这场斗争，要文斗，不要武斗。真理是在无产阶级手里。即使对资产阶级右派分子，也要文斗，不要武斗。文斗，可以充分揭露资产阶级右派的丑恶面目，充分驳倒他们的谬论，使他们陷于最大限度的孤立。
    十六条，是毛泽东同志提出的无产阶级文化大革命的纲领，是革命群众统一认识、统一行动的指南针。
    广大工农兵、革命的知识分子和革命的干部，是坚决拥护十六条的。我们革命群众，要认真学习十六条，拿起十六条这个武器，同本学校、本单位运动的实际情况做比较。合十六条的，就继续照办。不合十六条的，就要改过来。对那些抵制十六条的负责人，就要揭发，就要批判。
