On August 18, 1966, our great teacher, great leader, great commander-in-chief, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao, dressed in the uniform of the People's Liberation Army, along with his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao and other comrades, reviewed the million-strong army of the proletarian cultural revolution on Tiananmen.

The great teacher and the revolutionary masses have hearts that beat as one, celebrating together the proletarian cultural revolution.

Comrade Mao Zedong has the utmost faith in the masses, believing that "the people, and only the people, are the motive force in the creation of world history." During the proletarian cultural revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong repeatedly instructed us to trust the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the masses' initiative. We must mobilize the masses, let them rise up in revolution, educate themselves, manage themselves, and liberate themselves.

Some people stumble on the revolutionary path because they do not trust the masses, do not rely on the masses, and fail to see the immense revolutionary enthusiasm within the masses. They impose numerous rules and regulations on the masses, even suppressing mass movements, leading to a situation where right and wrong are confused and black and white are mixed up. At critical moments in the revolution, they lose their way and take the wrong path. Such lessons are not uncommon in our party's history. We must learn from them.

Comrade Mao Zedong often says that Communist Party members must never separate themselves from the masses, must never stand above the masses, acting like officials and lords, but should appear before the masses as ordinary laborers, immerse themselves among the masses, and blend in with them. Comrade Mao Zedong has set a brilliant example for us. He has always regarded himself as a servant of the people, always thinking of the people and serving them wholeheartedly. His relationship with the masses is the closest. He loves the masses the most, cares for the masses the most, and understands the masses' needs, wishes, and sentiments the most. He is the confidant of the masses.

Comrade Mao Zedong embodies the most humble spirit. He is the best at learning from the masses and summarizing the masses' experiences, concentrating the masses' wisdom. Comrade Mao Zedong says: "A revolutionary politician is merely the leader of thousands and millions of mass politicians. His task is to gather the opinions of mass politicians, refine them, and then return them to the masses to be accepted and practiced by the masses, rather than engaging in closed-door policy-making, acting cleverly, and being the only one with the right answers, like a noble-style 'politician'."

Every Communist Party member and every revolutionary cadre should follow Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings, be good at following the mass line in work, coming from the masses and going to the masses, first being a student of the masses and then a teacher of the masses. For things one does not understand, one must not pretend to know, but must ask about everything, not be ashamed to ask, and be good at listening to the masses' opinions. If one has not yet clarified the situation and has not consulted with the masses, but instead issues orders and commands from above, directing the masses blindly, one will surely hit a snag and make mistakes.

Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. The great Mao Zedong Thought is closely linked with the broad masses, which is the source of our victory in the communist cause and the source of our victory in the proletarian cultural revolution.

　　毛主席和群众在一起
    一九六六年八月十八日，我们伟大的导师，伟大的领袖，伟大的统帅，伟大的舵手毛主席，穿着人民解放军军装，同他的亲密战友林彪同志，以及其他同志，在天安门上检阅了无产阶级文化革命的百万大军。
    伟大导师和革命群众心连着心，同声欢庆无产阶级文化大革命。
    毛泽东同志最相信群众，认为“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”在无产阶级文化大革命中，毛泽东同志反复地教导我们，要信任群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神。要放手发动群众，让群众自己起来革命，自己教育自己，自己管理自己，自己解放自己。
    有些人在革命的道路上跌跤子，就是因为他们不相信群众，不依靠群众，对于群众中蕴藏着的极大的革命积极性，一概看不见。他们总是用许多清规戒律束缚群众的手脚，甚至压制群众运动，把事情闹到颠倒是非、混淆黑白的程度。在革命的紧要关头，他们就迷失方向，走错路线。这样的教训，在我们党的历史上是并不少见的。我们应当引以为戒。
    毛泽东同志经常说，共产党员绝不可脱离群众，绝不可高踞于群众之上，做官当老爷，而应当以普通劳动者的姿态，出现在群众面前，深入于群众之中，同群众打成一片。毛泽东同志为我们作出了光辉的榜样。他从来都把自己当作是人民的勤务员，时时刻刻替人民着想，全心全意为人民服务。他同群众的关系最亲密。他最热爱群众，最关心群众，最了解群众的需要，群众的愿望，群众的情绪。他是群众的知心人。
    毛泽东同志具有最谦逊的精神。他最善于向群众学习，最善于总结群众的经验，集中群众的智慧。毛泽东同志说：革命的政治家，“只是千千万万的群众政治家的领袖，他们的任务在于把群众政治家的意见集中起来，加以提炼，再使之回到群众中去，为群众所接受，所实践，而不是闭门造车，自作聪明，只此一家，别无分店的那种贵族式的所谓‘政治家’”。
    每个共产党员，每个革命干部，都应当遵照毛泽东同志的教导，善于在工作中走群众路线，从群众中来，到群众中去，先当群众的学生，后当群众的先生。自己不懂的事情，切不可强不知以为知，要每事问，要不耻下问，要善于倾听群众的意见。如果情况还没有搞清楚，没有同群众商量，就在那里指手划脚，发号施令，站在群众头上瞎指挥，那就一定会碰钉子，犯错误。
    毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。伟大的毛泽东思想和广大群众紧紧地结合，这是我们共产主义事业胜利的源泉，也是我们无产阶级文化大革命胜利的源泉。
