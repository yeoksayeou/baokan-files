Our great leader Chairman Mao has recently given extremely important directives regarding the construction of our army.

Chairman Mao said: The People's Liberation Army should be a great school. This great school should study politics, study military affairs, study culture, and also engage in agricultural and sideline production, and operate some small and medium-sized factories to produce some of the products it needs and products that can be exchanged with the state on an equal basis. This great school should also engage in mass work, participate in the socialist education movement in factories and villages; after the socialist education movement is completed, there is always mass work to be done, so that the military and the people are always united; and it should also participate in the criticism of the bourgeois cultural revolution at all times. In this way, military education, military agriculture, military industry, and military-civilian integration can all be combined. Of course, there must be appropriate coordination, with a main focus and a secondary focus. Agricultural, industrial, and civilian work—each unit can only take on one or two of these tasks, not all at the same time.

Chairman Mao said: In this way, the role of several million troops will be very significant.

Chairman Mao's directive is issued at a time when our country is vigorously carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the class struggle at home and abroad is becoming increasingly sharp and complex. It is a great call to our army to move forward to a higher stage on the road of becoming highly proletarian and highly combat-ready. It is also issued at a time when our army is implementing the directives of the Central Military Commission and Comrade Lin Biao, actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing politics, and making great strides in all aspects. This is a great call for our army to advance to a higher stage on the road of becoming highly proletarian and highly combat-ready.

Chairman Mao wants us to turn the army into a great school. This great school, with the main task of being a combat force, combines military education, military agriculture, military industry, and military-civilian integration. It inherits and carries forward the fine traditions of our Party and army, cultivates and trains countless successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution, and makes several million people's armies play a greater role in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. This is a great school for learning, implementing, spreading, and defending Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao personally created this army, and it has been exactly thirty-nine years since then. This is an army absolutely led by the Communist Party of China, established according to the principles of Marxism-Leninism, and composed of workers and peasants. It is a completely new type of people's army, fundamentally different from feudal warlord armies and bourgeois armies.

As early as the initial stage of our army's establishment, Chairman Mao clearly pointed out that our army is not just about fighting, but is a armed group that performs revolutionary political tasks. In the famous resolution of the Gutian Conference, Chairman Mao wrote: "Without propaganda, organization, arming, and building revolutionary political power among the masses, the meaning of fighting is lost, and the meaning of the Red Army's existence is lost."

Chairman Mao set three major tasks for our army: fighting, doing mass work, and production. He pointed out that our army is always a combat force, but also a work force and a production force.

Before the nationwide victory, Chairman Mao said: "The army is a school," and "we must regard the 2.1 million field army as a huge cadre school."

Over the decades, our army has indeed followed Chairman Mao's teachings and done so.

Chairman Mao's recent directive is the latest summary of our army's decades of experience and the development of Chairman Mao's consistent military thought under new historical conditions. This directive has great historical and strategic significance for ensuring that our army always maintains its people's army character, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, promoting our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction, strengthening national defense, demonstrating the power of people's war, and opposing possible attacks by U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.

Chairman Mao's military thought is the most thorough, correct, and complete proletarian military thought.

Chairman Mao's military thought is fundamentally opposed to the view that only military affairs are important and politics are not, reducing the army's tasks to just fighting. It is fundamentally opposed to all bourgeois military thought.

Throughout the thirty-nine-year history of our army, the struggle between Chairman Mao's military thought and line and various forms of bourgeois military thought has never stopped. This was the case during the entire period of the democratic revolution, and it is also the case during the period of socialist revolution.

In the sixteen years since the founding of the nation, we have waged three major struggles against representatives of the bourgeois military line who have infiltrated the Party and the army.

The first major struggle began after the end of the Korean War. A small group of representatives of the bourgeois military line, under the guise of "regularization" and "modernization," completely copied foreign practices, attempting to negate our army's historical experience and fine traditions, and lead our army down the path of a bourgeois army. Their bourgeois military dogmatism was strongly resisted and opposed by the broad masses of cadres and soldiers in our army. The 1958 enlarged meeting of the Military Commission, under Chairman Mao's call to "overthrow the slave mentality and bury dogmatism," smashed their arrogant attack and defended Chairman Mao's military thought and line.

The second major struggle was carried out at the same time as our Party's struggle against the right-opportunist anti-Party clique in 1959. The main members of the anti-Party clique exposed at the Lushan Conference of the Party, using their important positions in the army, attempted to cancel the Party's absolute leadership over the army, cancel political work, cancel the army's participation in socialist construction and mass work, and cancel local armed forces and militias, fundamentally negating Chairman Mao's thought on the people's army and people's war. They attempted to transform our army according to the bourgeois and revisionist military line, making the army a tool for their usurpation of the Party and the state, realizing their personal ambitions. Following the Party's Lushan Conference, the enlarged meeting of the Military Commission thoroughly exposed their crimes and removed their positions. This was a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought!

Since Comrade Lin Biao took charge of the work of the Central Military Commission, he has most resolutely and thoroughly implemented Chairman Mao's military thought and line. In 1960, under the care and guidance of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, Comrade Lin Biao presided over the enlarged meeting of the Military Commission, further purged the influence of the bourgeois military line, corrected the direction of political work, and made the "Resolution on Strengthening Political and Ideological Work in the Army," inheriting and carrying forward the spirit of the Gutian Conference. This became a new milestone on our army's forward march. In recent years, under the leadership of the Central Military Commission and Comrade Lin Biao, the entire army has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, emphasized politics, insisted on the Four Firsts, carried forward the Three-Eight Style, practiced the Three Great Democracies, carried out the Four Good Units movement, participated in the socialist education movement and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, participated in and supported socialist construction, and made our army's revolutionary construction and all aspects of work flourish.

The third major struggle took place not long ago. This struggle exposed important members of the anti-Party, anti-socialist counter-revolutionary clique recently exposed by our Party, who held important positions in the army. They opposed the Party Central Committee, opposed Mao Zedong Thought, and secretly opposed Comrade Lin Biao's directive on emphasizing politics, shouting political command while actually advocating military first, technology first, and business first. They waved the red flag to oppose the red flag, spreading opportunism, attempting to replace Chairman Mao's proletarian military line with the bourgeois military line. Our Party's thorough exposure and criticism of this small group of anti-Party conspirators is a new great victory for Mao Zedong Thought!

Since the founding of the nation, the representatives of the bourgeoisie exposed in our army's major struggles have opposed Chairman Mao's directive to build our army into a powerful proletarian revolutionary army, opposed the Party's absolute leadership over the army, opposed political work, and opposed the mass line. They wanted bourgeois regularization but not proletarian revolutionization. They abandoned our army's glorious traditions and reduced our army's three major tasks to just one: training in peacetime and fighting in wartime. In short, their actions were completely opposed to Chairman Mao's military thought and his thought on turning our army into a great school. Their evil purpose was to turn our army into a bourgeois army that is detached from Mao Zedong Thought, proletarian politics, the masses, and productive labor, serving a few ambitious individuals.

The struggle between the two military thoughts and two military lines is a reflection of the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism, within the army. As long as classes and class struggle exist, this struggle will never end. The domestic and foreign class enemies want to change the color of our country, and first want to change the color of our army. Every time the class struggle becomes very tense, a small number of bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated our army always jump out to stir up trouble. However, under the bright light of great Mao Zedong Thought, the broad masses of cadres and soldiers in our army, including those who have been temporarily deceived, always manage to see through their ugly faces, expose them in broad daylight, and foil their conspiracies.

The history of our army over the decades fully proves that Chairman Mao's military thought and line are unshakable truths and the lifeblood of our army. At any time and under any circumstances, we must not deviate even slightly from the track of Chairman Mao's military thought and line.

We must enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's great call, inherit and carry forward the fine traditions of our army, and turn our army into a great school.

We must resolutely follow Chairman Mao's directive to study politics, study military affairs, and study culture. We must actively participate in the socialist education movement and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Everyone must take up Mao Zedong Thought as the sharpest weapon to criticize the bourgeoisie. We must always be prepared to smash possible attacks by U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.

We must resolutely follow Chairman Mao's directive to combine military education, military agriculture, military industry, and military-civilian integration. Everyone must participate in productive labor and always maintain the character of the working people. Everyone must do mass work, observe the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, so that the military and the people are always united. We must do a good job in militia work, promote the thought of people's war among the people, enthusiastically participate in and support socialist construction, actively assist local work, humbly learn from the local areas, and strengthen the unity between the army and the local areas.

To run this great school well, the most important and fundamental thing is to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works. We must learn in struggle and use in struggle. This great school must always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, always emphasize proletarian politics, use Mao Zedong Thought to guide all work, and use Mao Zedong Thought to arm everyone.

Our great school is a great school of Mao Zedong Thought!

We must run this great school of Mao Zedong Thought well!

Under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, march forward bravely!

    把我军办成毛泽东思想的大学校
    ——纪念我军建军三十九周年
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席，最近对我军建设作了极其重要的指示。
    毛主席说：人民解放军应该是一个大学校。这个大学校，要学政治，学军事，学文化，又能从事农副业生产，又能办一些中小工厂，生产自己需要的若干产品和与国家等价交换的产品。这个大学校，又能从事群众工作，参加工厂、农村的社会主义教育运动；社会主义教育运动完了，随时都有群众工作可做，使军民永远打成一片；又要随时参加批判资产阶级的文化革命斗争。这样，军学、军农、军工、军民这几项都可以兼起来。当然，要调配适当，要有主有从，农、工、民三项，一个部队只能兼一项或两项，不能同时都兼起来。
    毛主席说：这样，几百万军队所起的作用就是很大的了。
    毛主席的这一指示，是在我国轰轰烈烈开展无产阶级文化大革命，国内外阶级斗争更加尖锐、复杂的形势下，对我军发出的伟大号召；是在我军贯彻执行中央军委和林彪同志的指示，活学活用毛主席著作，大力突出政治，各方面工作都有很大发展的形势下，对我军发出的伟大号召。这是一个要求我军在非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的道路上向更高阶段前进的伟大号召。
    毛主席要我们把军队办成一个大学校。这个大学校，以执行战斗队的任务为主，把军学、军农、军工、军民这几项都兼起来，继承和发扬我党我军的优良传统，培养和造就千千万万个无产阶级革命事业接班人，使几百万人民军队在社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中起更大的作用。这是一个学习毛泽东思想，贯彻毛泽东思想，传播毛泽东思想，捍卫毛泽东思想的大学校。
    毛主席亲手缔造了我们这支军队，到现在，已经整整三十九年了。这是一支中国共产党绝对领导的，按照马克思列宁主义原则建立起来的工人农民的军队，是一支根本区别于封建军阀军队、资产阶级军队的完全新型的人民军队。
    毛主席早在我军创建初期，就明确指出，我军决不是单纯地打仗的，而是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。毛主席在著名的古田会议决议中写道：“离了对群众的宣传、组织、武装和建设革命政权等项目标，就是失去了打仗的意义，也就是失去了红军存在的意义”。
    毛主席为我军规定了打仗、做群众工作、生产三大任务。他指出，我军永远是一个战斗队，同时又是一个工作队，一个生产队。
    毛主席在全国胜利前夕说过：“军队就是一个学校”，“必须把二百一十万野战军看成一个巨大的干部学校”。
    几十年来，我军正是遵照毛主席的教导这样做了的。
    毛主席最近作出的指示，就是我军几十年经验的最新总结，是毛主席一贯的建军思想在新的历史条件下的发展。这一指示，对于使我军永远保持人民军队的本色，巩固无产阶级专政，对于促进我国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设，对于加强国防，发挥人民战争威力，反对美帝国主义及其帮凶可能的进攻，具有伟大的历史意义和战略意义。
    毛主席的建军思想，是最彻底、最正确、最完整的无产阶级的建军思想。
    毛主席的建军思想，是同那种只要军事、不要政治，把军队的任务缩小为单纯打仗一项的单纯军事观点根本对立的，是同一切资产阶级军事思想根本对立的。
    在我军三十九年的历史中，毛主席的建军思想和建军路线，同形形色色的资产阶级军事思想的斗争，一直没有停止过。在整个民主革命时期是这样，在社会主义革命时期也是这样。
    建国十六年来，我们同混进党内、军内的资产阶级军事路线代表人物，进行了三次大的斗争。
    第一次大的斗争，是从抗美援朝战争结束后开始的。一小撮资产阶级军事路线的代表人物，打着“正规化”“现代化”的幌子，全盘照搬外国的一套，妄图否定我军的历史经验和优良传统，把我军引上资产阶级军队的道路。他们所推行的资产阶级军事教条主义，遭到我军广大干部战士的强烈抵制和反对。一九五八年的军委扩大会议，在毛主席提出的“打倒奴隶思想，埋葬教条主义”的号召下，粉碎了他们的猖狂进攻，捍卫了毛主席的建军思想和建军路线。
    第二次大的斗争，是和一九五九年我们党对右倾机会主义反党集团的斗争同时进行的。党的庐山会议所揭露的反党集团的主要成员，借着他们在军队窃踞的重要职务，力图取消党对军队的绝对领导，取消政治工作，取消军队参加社会主义建设和做群众工作的任务，取消地方武装和民兵，从根本上否定毛主席的人民军队和人民战争的思想。他们妄想按照资产阶级的、修正主义的军事路线，改造我们的军队，使军队变成他们篡党、篡政，实现个人野心的工具。继党的庐山会议之后召开的军委扩大会议，彻底清算了他们的罪行，罢了他们的官。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    林彪同志主持中央军委的工作以来，最坚决最彻底地贯彻执行了毛主席的建军思想和建军路线。一九六○年，在党中央和毛主席的关怀和指导下，由林彪同志主持召开的军委扩大会议，进一步肃清了资产阶级军事路线的影响，端正了政治工作的方向，作出了《关于加强军队政治思想工作的决议》，继承和发扬了古田会议的精神，成为我军前进道路上一个新的里程碑。几年来，在中央军委和林彪同志领导下，全军高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，突出政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，发扬三大民主，开展四好连队运动，参加社会主义教育运动和无产阶级文化大革命，参加和支援社会主义建设，使我军革命化建设和各方面工作出现了一个蓬勃发展的大好局面。
    第三次大的斗争，发生在不久以前。这次斗争所揭露的在军队窃踞重要职务的资产阶级代表人物，是我们党最近揭发出来的反党反社会主义的反革命集团的重要成员。他们反对党中央，反对毛泽东思想，对林彪同志关于突出政治的指示，阳奉阴违，嘴上喊着政治挂帅，实际搞的是军事第一、技术第一、业务第一。他们打着“红旗”反红旗，大肆散布折中主义即机会主义，妄图用资产阶级军事路线，代替毛主席的无产阶级军事路线。我们党对这一小撮反党野心家的彻底揭露和批判，是毛泽东思想的新的伟大胜利！
    建国以来，我军几次大的斗争所揭露的那些资产阶级代表人物，他们反对毛主席关于把我军建设成为强大的无产阶级革命军队的方针，反对党对军队的绝对领导，反对政治工作，反对群众路线。他们只要资产阶级的正规化，不要无产阶级的革命化。他们抛弃我军的光荣传统，把我军的三大任务缩小为平时练武、战时打仗的一项。总之，他们搞的那一套，都是同毛主席的建军思想，同毛主席关于把我军办成一个大学校的思想，完全相对抗的。他们的罪恶目的，就是要使我军变成一支脱离毛泽东思想，脱离无产阶级政治，脱离人民群众，脱离生产劳动，为少数野心家服务的资产阶级军队。
    两种建军思想、两条建军路线的斗争，是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级、社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争在军队内部的反映。只要阶级和阶级斗争还存在，这种斗争就永远不会完结。国内外阶级敌人妄想使我们的国家改变颜色，首先就要使我们的军队改变颜色。每当阶级斗争十分紧张的关头，混进我军的极少数资产阶级代表人物，总是要跳出来兴风作浪。但是，在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，我军广大干部战士，包括某些暂时受蒙蔽的人，总是能够识破他们的丑恶面貌，把他们暴露在光天化日之下，使他们的阴谋不能得逞。
    我军几十年的历史，充分说明了：毛主席的建军思想和建军路线，是颠扑不破的真理，是我军的命根子。在任何时候，在任何情况下，我们都不可稍稍离开毛主席的建军思想和建军路线的轨道。
    我们必须热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召，继承和发扬我军的优良传统，把我军办成一个大学校。
    我们要坚决遵照毛主席的指示，学政治，学军事，学文化。要积极参加社会主义教育运动，参加无产阶级文化大革命。要人人拿起毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器，批判资产阶级。要随时作好准备，粉碎美帝国主义及其帮凶可能发动的进攻。
    我们要坚决遵照毛主席的指示，把军学、军农、军工、军民都兼起来。要人人参加生产劳动，永远保持劳动人民的本色。要人人做群众工作，遵守三大纪律八项注意，使军民永远打成一片。要搞好民兵工作，在人民群众中贯彻人民战争思想。要热情参加和支援社会主义建设，积极协助地方工作，虚心向地方学习，加强军队和地方的团结。
    要办好军队这个大学校，最重要最根本的，就是要活学活用毛主席著作。要在斗争中学，在斗争中用。这个大学校，必须永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远突出无产阶级政治，用毛泽东思想指导一切工作，用毛泽东思想把每个人武装起来。
    我们这个大学校，是一个毛泽东思想的大学校！
    我们一定要办好这个毛泽东思想的大学校！
    在伟大的毛泽东思想旗帜下，奋勇前进！
