July is the season when the golden wheat and the green grapes adorn the Adriatic coast. The Beijing Song and Dance Troupe, accompanying Premier Zhou Enlai and the Chinese Party and Government Delegation, arrived in Albania for a friendly visit. Following Chairman Mao's directive that art should serve proletarian politics and the workers, peasants, and soldiers, the troupe spent over a month traveling to 23 districts across Albania, covering more than 3,000 kilometers, performing nearly 50 shows, and entertaining over 180,000 spectators. They were greeted with unprecedented enthusiasm by the Albanian people.

Everywhere the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe went, local party and government leaders and the masses welcomed them as if they were family, following Albania's most solemn customs to greet and see them off at the border. In Lushnje, an elderly farmer, after watching a performance, insisted on giving the troupe an eagle he had raised for seven years, symbolizing the heroic spirit of the Albanian people. After each performance, many spectators lingered, voluntarily helping the troupe dismantle the stage and carry props. In Elbasan, several women in their sixties and seventies insisted on helping the troupe carry props.

Why was the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe received with such fervor? An Albanian soldier answered this question with a simple and heartfelt statement.

It was after a performance in Durres. The audience, reluctant to part, gathered around the Chinese performers, sharing the deep friendship between the peoples of China and Albania. As the Chinese comrades were about to leave, they handed out a few badges bearing Chairman Mao's portrait to the audience as souvenirs. However, there was one soldier who did not receive a badge. As the Chinese comrades felt embarrassed, the soldier calmly placed his hand on his chest and smiled, "It's okay, even though I didn't get a Mao Zedong badge, I have Mao Zedong in my heart!"

As Comrade Dejana, the Albanian Minister of Education and Culture, said at the farewell banquet for the troupe, "The Albanian workers, peasants, and soldiers extend their arms to welcome the Chinese art that is guided and inspired by Mao Zedong's thought. Your performances embody the battle cry of the Chinese Communist Party's art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, serving proletarian politics, consolidating and developing the socialist system, and gradually transitioning to communism. Your performances show the Albanian people the greatness of the Chinese people, the greatness of the glorious Chinese Communist Party, and the greatness of Mao Zedong's thought."

Whenever the Chinese artists sang "The Long March" and the stage curtain displayed a radiant portrait of Chairman Mao, or when the performers danced "Beijing-Tirana" and the stage showed a large portrait of Chairman Mao and Enver Hoxha, the audience applauded enthusiastically and shouted, "Enver-Mao!" In Shimal, an 78-year-old veteran, Marta, warmly held the performers' hands and said, "I am very happy to see you. With Mao Zedong leading, the world revolution will definitely win." In Pogradec, a 57-year-old veteran, Nushi, enthusiastically applauded and nodded in approval when he saw the Chinese female militia studying Chairman Mao's quotations in the dance "Flower on the Grassland." He said, "Mao Zedong's books can cure the ailments of the heart and elevate people's thoughts. Our Party of Labor has done many important things, one of which is translating and publishing 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong.' I have the Albanian version of the five-volume 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong,' and I often read it."

Many spectators, after watching "Destroying the 'Strategic Villages,'" said that the performance reflected the internationalist spirit of the Chinese people supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation. Model soldier Kadri said, "I love the dance 'Ode to the Storm' the most. It shows the spirit of the Chinese people supporting the revolutionary struggle of the African people." Soldier Male, after watching the performance, said, "I particularly like the dance 'On the March.' It inspires us to intensify our military training and be prepared to counter all the tricks and schemes of imperialism and modern revisionism."

The Beijing Song and Dance Troupe brought the thought of art serving proletarian politics and the workers, peasants, and soldiers, as guided by Chairman Mao, to Albania.

They endured hardships and fatigue, insisting on bringing revolutionary art to factories, villages, and military camps, serving the Albanian people. They studied Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and other works, proposing four equalities: equal treatment of theaters and squares, day and night, many or few spectators, and good or poor conditions.

The members of the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe performed for 60,000 spectators in the "Skanderbeg" Square in Tirana and for a dozen soldiers in the Tropoja border outpost. With deep class feelings for the Albanian working people, they often performed twice a day during long journeys. In the northern region, four dancers in a small performance team almost always performed five items each. Dancers, musicians, and stage workers also participated in performances such as the "Beijing-Tirana" dance, reflecting Sino-Albanian friendship.

The troupe members had such great enthusiasm and energy because they had actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works. They performed with the great thought of Mao Zedong and deep class feelings for the Albanian people.

During their performances and visits, the troupe also learned many Albanian folk songs and dances from Albanian artists. They participated in production labor with Albanian workers in factories and agricultural cooperatives, visited the Museum of Revolutionary History, and learned about the Albanian people's heroic struggle and revolutionary spirit of "one hand holding a pickaxe, the other holding a gun" to resist imperialism and revisionism.

### 毛泽东的文艺战士在山鹰之国

    毛泽东的文艺战士在山鹰之国
    七月，正是亚得里亚海滨麦穗金黄，葡萄滴翠的丰收季节。中国北京歌舞团随同周恩来同志率领的中国党政代表团来到阿尔巴尼亚作友好访问。歌舞团遵照毛主席的文艺为无产阶级政治服务，为工农兵服务的最高指示，上山下乡，历时一个多月，走遍了阿尔巴尼亚的二十三个区，行程三千多公里，演出近五十场，观众达十八万人次以上，受到了阿尔巴尼亚人民空前热烈的欢迎。
    北京歌舞团每到一个地方，阿尔巴尼亚各区党政领导同志和群众象迎接亲人一样，按照阿尔巴尼亚最隆重的礼节，到边界迎送歌舞团。卢比克的一位老农民看了演出以后，一定要把自己精心喂养了七年的一只象征着阿尔巴尼亚人民英雄气概的山鹰送给歌舞团。每次演出以后，都有许多观众迟迟不愿离去，自动帮助歌舞团卸台、搬运道具。在爱尔巴桑，十几位六、七十岁的老大娘也坚持要帮助歌舞团搬运道具。
    北京歌舞团为什么受到这样热烈的欢迎呢？一位阿尔巴尼亚战士用一句非常朴实的话，回答了这个问题。
    那是北京歌舞团在都拉斯的一场演出以后，观众们恋恋不舍地围着中国演员们，共叙中阿两国人民的深情厚谊。临别时，中国同志把几枚带有毛主席胸象的纪念章送给观众留念。当时，由于随身带得不多，最后有一位战士没有拿到纪念章。中国同志正感到为难时，这位战士却不慌不忙地把手放在胸前，笑着说：“不要紧，我虽然没有拿到毛泽东纪念章，但是，我的心里有毛泽东！”
    正如阿尔巴尼亚教育和文化部长德雅纳同志在为歌舞团饯行的宴会上说的：“阿尔巴尼亚工人、农民、战士伸出双臂欢迎在毛泽东思想照耀和指引下的中国艺术。你们的歌舞体现了中国共产党的文艺为工农兵服务，为无产阶级的政治服务，为巩固和发展社会主义制度、逐步向共产主义过渡服务的战斗口号。你们的歌舞向阿尔巴尼亚人民显示了中国人民的伟大，光荣的中国共产党的伟大，毛泽东思想的伟大。”
    每当中国艺术家们高唱长征组歌中《进遵义》一曲，舞台天幕上出现了光芒四射的毛泽东同志的巨幅画象时，每当演员们在演出“北京—地拉那”舞蹈，台上出现毛泽东同志和恩维尔·霍查同志的巨幅画象时，观众经久不息地热烈鼓掌，欢呼“恩维尔—毛泽东”。在希马拉，七十八岁的老游击队员马尔塔亲切地拉着演员们的手说：“我看到你们很高兴。有毛泽东领导，世界革命一定胜利”。在波格拉迪茨，五十七岁的老游击队员努奇在舞蹈“塞上花”中，看到中国女民兵学习毛主席语录时，热烈鼓掌，点头称赞。他说：“毛主席的书能医治人们心中的病症，能使人们的思想提高。我们劳动党做了很多重要的工作。其中之一就是翻译和出版了《毛泽东选集》。我有阿文版五卷本《毛泽东选集》，我经常读它。”
    许多观众看了“捣毁‘战略村’”后说，这个节目反映了中国人民支持越南人民抗美救国斗争的国际主义精神。模范战士卡德里说：“我最爱看舞蹈‘风雷颂’。它表现了中国人民支持非洲人民革命斗争的精神。”战士马莱看了演出后说：“我特别喜欢‘在野营路上’这个舞蹈，它鼓舞我们要加紧军事训练，为反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的一切阴谋诡计而作好准备。”
    中国北京歌舞团带着毛主席的文艺为无产阶级政治服务、为工农兵服务的思想来到阿尔巴尼亚。
    他们不怕苦、不怕累，坚持把革命艺术送到工厂、农村和驻军营房里，为阿尔巴尼亚人民服务。他们学习了毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》、《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等文章，提出了四个一样：剧场、广场一样，白天、黑夜一样，观众多、观众少一样，条件好、条件差一样。
    北京歌舞团的同志们在地拉那“斯坎德培”广场为六万观众演出过，也在特罗波雅边防哨所为十几个战士演出过。演员们怀着对阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民深厚的阶级感情，常常在长途旅行中，一天演出两场。到北方地区演出的一个小队中的四个舞蹈演员，差不多每场都要演出五个节目。歌舞演员、乐器演奏者和舞台工作者也参加了反映中阿友谊的“北京—地拉那”舞蹈等节目的演出。
    歌舞团的同志们所以有这样大的热情和干劲，首先是他们活学活用了毛主席著作的结果。他们就是带着伟大的毛泽东思想和对阿尔巴尼亚人民深厚阶级感情去演出的。
    歌舞团在演出和访问过程中，还向阿尔巴尼亚艺术家学习了许多阿尔巴尼亚民歌和民间舞蹈。他们在工厂、农业合作社同阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民一起参加了生产劳动，参观了革命历史博物馆，学习阿尔巴尼亚人民英勇斗争的历史和“一手拿镐、一手拿枪”坚持反对帝国主义、反对修正主义的革命精神。新华社记者
