The Chinese Embassy in Indonesia sent a note to the Indonesian Foreign Ministry on August 19, strongly protesting the Indonesian government's illegal and unreasonable seizure of the Chinese Consulate in Medan.

The note stated that on June 1, right-wing reactionary mobs in Indonesia, under the banner of "KAMI," forcibly stormed the Chinese Consulate in Medan, shouting anti-Chinese slogans, causing destruction and looting, and even publicly posting signs reading "Property of the Republic of Indonesia" and "Property of 'KAMI'." On June 2, the right-wing reactionary mobs continued to gather in front of the consulate, demanding to "take over the Chinese Consulate." Starting from June 3, the Indonesian police actually dispatched an officer to guard the consulate, monitoring the movements of consulate staff and ordering police to raise and lower the Indonesian flag on the consulate's flagpole every day. On June 5, the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Second Military Region, Bermada, personally led the mob into the consulate and held a so-called "ceremony" where "KAMI" handed over the consulate to the Second Military Region. Bermada spoke on behalf of the Second Military Region, enthusiastically praising this act of violence.

The note said, "The above facts indisputably show that the so-called 'takeover' of the Chinese Consulate in Medan was completely carried out under the direct orders of the military authorities in North Sumatra. It is another outrageous anti-Chinese activity planned by the right-wing reactionary forces in Indonesia, aimed at further damaging the relations between China and Indonesia. It is another criminal record of the Indonesian government's illegal and unreasonable seizure of Chinese diplomatic premises."

The note further stated that since November of last year, the Chinese Consulate in Medan has been attacked and destroyed by right-wing reactionary mobs in Indonesia five times, culminating in the brazen "takeover" by the military authorities in North Sumatra. The right-wing reactionary forces in Indonesia blatantly violate Chinese consular privileges and brazenly trample on international norms, indeed acting as the vanguard of anti-China forces worldwide. The note concluded, "The Embassy demands that the Indonesian government publicly apologize for this incident, immediately remove the Indonesian flag hanging in the courtyard of the Chinese Consulate in Medan, withdraw the police personnel engaged in illegal activities at the consulate, compensate for all damages, and ensure the safety of consulate staff and their families."

    我国驻印尼大使馆照会印尼外交部
    强烈抗议印尼当局非法霸占我驻棉兰领事馆
    谴责印尼右派反动势力继续猖狂反华进一步破坏两国关系
    新华社二十二日讯  雅加达消息：中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆八月十九日照会印度尼西亚外交部，强烈抗议印度尼西亚政府非法和无理霸占中国驻棉兰领事馆的暴行。
    照会说，今年六月一日，印度尼西亚右派反动暴徒打着“卡米”的旗号，强行冲进中国驻棉兰领事馆内，狂呼反华口号，进行破坏和抢掠，还公然张贴“属于印度尼西亚共和国所有”、“属于‘卡米’所有”等字条。右派反动暴徒们，二日继续集合在领事馆门前，叫嚣要“接管中国领事馆”。六月三日起，印度尼西亚警方居然派一个警官驻守领事馆，监视领事馆雇员的行动，指挥警察在领事馆的旗杆上每天升降印度尼西亚国旗。六月五日，印度尼西亚第二军区副参谋长贝尔玛达竟亲自率领暴徒闯进领事馆，并且举行了所谓由“卡米”把领事馆“移交”给第二军区的“仪式”。贝尔玛达当场代表第二军区讲话，对这次暴行狂热地加以赞扬。
    照会说，“上述事实，无可辩驳地表明：所谓‘接管’中国驻棉兰领事馆的暴行，完全是在北苏门答腊军事当局的直接指使下干出来的，是印度尼西亚右派反动势力策划的又一次旨在进一步破坏中国和印度尼西亚两国关系的猖狂反华活动，是印度尼西亚政府非法和无理霸占中国代表机构办公处的又一个犯罪记录。”
    照会说，自去年十一月以来，中国驻棉兰领事馆遭受印度尼西亚右派反动势力组织的暴徒的袭击和破坏已达五次之多，最后竟悍然由北苏门答腊军事当局出面“接管”。印度尼西亚右派反动势力明目张胆地侵犯中国领事特权，肆无忌惮地践踏国际关系准则，确实充当了世界上一切反动势力反华的急先锋。照会最后说，“大使馆要求印度尼西亚政府就此事件公开道歉，立即降下悬挂在中国驻棉兰领事馆院内的印度尼西亚国旗，撤走到领事馆进行非法活动的警察人员，赔偿一切损失，并保证领事馆雇员及其家属的安全。”
