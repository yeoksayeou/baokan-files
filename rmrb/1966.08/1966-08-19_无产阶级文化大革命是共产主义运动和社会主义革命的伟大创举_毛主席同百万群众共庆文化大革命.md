The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a Great Initiative of the Communist Movement and the Socialist Revolution

Chairman Mao Celebrates the Cultural Revolution with Millions of People

Chairman Mao and Comrades Lin Biao, Zhou Enlai, and Others Receive Student Representatives and Review the Cultural Revolution Army's Parade

Chairman Mao said: "This movement is on a grand scale and has indeed mobilized the masses. It has great significance for the ideological revolution of the people of the whole country."

Comrades Lin Biao and Zhou Enlai delivered important speeches, and revolutionary teachers and students from Beijing, Harbin, Changsha, Nanjing, and other places also spoke.

Xinhua News Agency, August 18th: Our great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, today, together with millions of revolutionary masses from Beijing and all over the country, held a celebration of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution at the center of the proletarian revolution, in our great motherland's capital, in the magnificent Tiananmen Square.

At dawn today, as the sun rose from the eastern horizon, casting its rays, Chairman Mao came to the Tiananmen Square, where the crowd was like a sea of people and a forest of red flags. He met with the revolutionary masses who had gathered from all directions. Chairman Mao wore a green military uniform. The red star on his cap shone brightly. Chairman Mao walked across the Golden Water Bridge in front of Tiananmen, straight into the crowd, shaking hands with many people around him, and waving to the entire assembly of revolutionaries. At this moment, the square boiled over, with everyone raising their hands high above their heads, jumping and cheering towards Chairman Mao, clapping their hands. Many people clapped until their palms turned red, and many people shed tears of excitement, saying, "Chairman Mao has come! Chairman Mao is among us!" The square echoed with the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!" The cheers grew louder and louder, shaking the skies of the capital.

Our great leader Chairman Mao spent the entire morning, for over six hours, with the millions of revolutionary masses. During the review of the parade of the million-strong Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution Army, Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao stood shoulder to shoulder on Tiananmen, watching the endless parade, and happily said to Comrade Lin Biao, "This movement is on a grand scale and has indeed mobilized the masses. It has great significance for the ideological revolution of the people of the whole country."

Tens of thousands of "Red Guards" wearing red armbands stood out prominently at today's meeting. They were full of spirit and vigor, like dragons and tigers. The "Red Guards" are a revolutionary mass organization created by the students of Beijing's universities and middle schools during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They vowed to be lifelong defenders of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, and the motherland. On Tiananmen, on the east and west viewing stands on both sides of Tiananmen, stood representatives of the "Red Guards." On Tiananmen, in Tiananmen Square, and on the east and west Chang'an Streets on both sides of the square, today's order was maintained by the "Red Guards."

During the meeting, a "Red Guard" from Beijing Normal University's Women's Middle School ascended Tiananmen and pinned a "Red Guard" armband on Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao shook hands with her warmly. The "Red Guards" on and below the city wall were overjoyed, some jumping a foot high, very excited, saying, "Chairman Mao is the commander, and we are his soldiers." Some said, "Chairman Mao has joined our 'Red Guards,' which is the greatest support and encouragement for us. Chairman Mao is backing us up, and we are not afraid of anything."

About 1,500 student representatives ascended Tiananmen and participated in the meeting with the Party and state leaders. Chairman Mao and Comrades Lin Biao, Zhou Enlai, Jiang Qing, and others received them in batches, talked with them, and took photos together. When Chairman Mao received them, the students excitedly gathered around their beloved Chairman Mao, continuously shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

At 7:30 AM, the celebration began. To the tune of "The East Is Red," Chairman Mao and Comrades Lin Biao and others appeared on Tiananmen. At this moment, the entire audience cheered, countless hands holding red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" stretched towards Tiananmen, millions of hearts flew towards Chairman Mao, and millions of eyes full of revolutionary passion looked up at Chairman Mao.

When people saw their beloved Chairman Mao dressed in a simple military uniform, their emotions became even more stirred. They said, "Chairman Mao wearing a military uniform makes us feel even closer. Chairman Mao is always fighting with us." Some said, "With Chairman Mao as our supreme commander, we feel infinite happiness. We will be good soldiers of Chairman Mao for life, following Chairman Mao to make revolution for life."

The celebration was presided over by Comrade Chen Boda, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and the head of the Central Cultural Revolution Group. In his opening remarks, he said, "Our great leader, great teacher, and great helmsman Chairman Mao is here with everyone today. (The crowd enthusiastically cheered for Chairman Mao) Chairman Mao is always with the masses. His heart is always with the people. This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is personally led by Chairman Mao. His appearance today greatly encourages us and will greatly promote the Cultural Revolution forward."

Comrade Lin Biao spoke amidst thunderous applause from the entire audience.

Comrade Lin Biao, on behalf of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, greeted everyone.

Comrade Lin Biao said:

"The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution proposed by Chairman Mao is a great initiative in the communist movement and a great initiative in the socialist revolution!

"The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to eliminate bourgeois ideology, establish proletarian ideology, reform people's souls, achieve ideological revolution, uproot the roots of revisionism, and consolidate and develop the socialist system.

"We must overthrow the authorities who take the capitalist road, overthrow the reactionary authorities of the bourgeoisie, overthrow all the bourgeois conservatives, oppose all kinds of suppression of the revolution, and overthrow all the monsters and demons!

"We must thoroughly smash all the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes, reform all the superstructures that do not adapt to the socialist economic base, and sweep away all the harmful insects and remove all the obstacles!

"We must thoroughly establish the authority of the proletariat, establish the new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits of the proletariat. In short, we must thoroughly establish Mao Zedong Thought. We must let hundreds of millions of people master Mao Zedong Thought, let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all ideological positions, use Mao Zedong Thought to change the spiritual face of the entire society, and let this great spiritual force of Mao Zedong Thought become a great material force!

"This Cultural Revolution is a major event concerning the fate of our Party and state, and a major event concerning the future of our Party and state!

"To carry out this Cultural Revolution well, what do we rely on? We rely on the great Mao Zedong Thought and the wisdom and strength of the masses!"

Comrade Lin Biao said, "With Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership and the most powerful weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, we can be invincible, conquer all, and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!"

Comrade Lin Biao said, "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we must launch a fierce attack on the ideological authority of the bourgeoisie, old customs, and old habits, thoroughly overthrow, smash, and make the counter-revolutionary revisionists, bourgeois rightists, and reactionary authorities of the bourgeoisie lose their prestige forever and never be able to rise again!"

Comrade Zhou Enlai then spoke at the meeting. Comrade Zhou Enlai said, "The Party Central Committee has just concluded its Eleventh Plenum. This meeting was held under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao. It was a meeting of great historical significance. The success of this meeting is a new victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

"The sixteen points passed at this meeting were formulated under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao and are the program for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. All revolutionary comrades must seriously study, familiarize themselves with, master, and apply them. This is our weapon for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the guide for our actions. We must study and apply this great program well and implement it in our practical actions.

"In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must thoroughly smash bourgeois ideology and thoroughly establish proletarian ideology, which is to thoroughly establish Mao Zedong Thought. The helmsman of sailing the great sea is our great helmsman, Chairman Mao. We must respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call and further carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works throughout the Party, the army, and the country.

"We must definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, build socialist China into an iron fortress of the proletariat, and complete the glorious historical mission entrusted to us by the Chinese people and the people of the world revolution."

During the speeches by Comrades Lin Biao and Zhou Enlai, the millions of people in the square repeatedly raised their arms and shouted, "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Long live the great Communist Party of China! Long live the great Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!"

Representatives from Beijing University, Nie Yuanzi, and students from Beijing, Harbin, Changsha, Nanjing, and other places spoke at the meeting. They expressed their deep and sincere feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao and their iron will to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, determined to pass on and carry forward Mao Zedong Thought, and ensure that our socialist iron fortress will never change color. They said:

"Our country is carrying out an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao. This is a revolution of world significance. We must smash the old world and create a new world, and carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end."

"The helmsman of sailing the great sea, the sun that makes all things grow, and the revolution rely on Mao Zedong Thought. We sincerely wish our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao a long life. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words, care about state affairs, and carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, temper ourselves and test ourselves in the great winds and waves, and become the most reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause."

"Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in our hearts. The Chinese people's revolution has never been calm. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings, temper and test ourselves in the great winds and waves. We vow to defend the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. In front of us, there are mountains of knives and seas of fire, but there is also the lighthouse of Mao Zedong Thought. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we will definitely win."

"Chairman Mao is with us. This is the most important and happiest moment of our lives. We will read Chairman Mao's books for life, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good students of Chairman Mao."

The passionate speeches of revolutionary students from various places stirred up long periods of thunderous applause in Tiananmen Square.

After the celebration, the million-strong Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution Army marched through Tiananmen Square, accepting the inspection of the great leader Chairman Mao. Revolutionary teachers and students from universities and middle schools in the capital and from all over the country, workers, peasants, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and cadres from various departments in the capital, with high spirits and vigorous steps, marched through Tiananmen Square. They expressed here their firm support for the Party Central Committee's decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, determined to be the vanguards of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and carry out the socialist revolution to the end.

Chairman Mao and Comrades Lin Biao, Zhou Enlai, and others stood on Tiananmen to inspect the marching columns, repeatedly waving to the million revolutionary masses. During the celebration parade, Chairman Mao and Comrades Lin Biao and others on Tiananmen repeatedly applauded the million revolutionary masses in the square. The million masses sang "The Helmsman of the Great Sea" over and over again and shouted "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!" a thousand times and ten thousand times.

    新华社十八日讯　我们的伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席，今天同北京和来自全国各地的百万革命群众一起，在无产阶级革命的中心，在我们伟大祖国的首都，在雄伟的天安门广场，举行了庆祝无产阶级文化大革命的大会。
    今天清晨五时，太阳刚从东方地平线上射出万丈光芒，毛主席便来到了人群如海、红旗如林的天安门广场，会见了早已从四面八方汇集到这里的革命群众。毛主席穿一套草绿色的布军装。主席的军帽上一颗红星闪闪发光。毛主席走过天安门前金水桥，一直走进群众的队伍当中，同周围的许多人紧紧握手，并且向全场革命群众招手致意。这时，广场上沸腾起来，人人双手高举过顶，向着毛主席跳跃着，欢呼着，拍着手。许多人把手掌心都拍红了，许多人流下了激动的眼泪，他们欢喜地说：“毛主席来了！毛主席到我们中间来了！”广场上，万众放声高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”欢呼声浪一阵高过一阵，震荡着首都的天空。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席，在今天上午整整六个多小时中，一直和百万革命群众在一起。在检阅百万无产阶级文化革命大军的庆祝游行时，毛主席和林彪同志肩并肩地站在天安门上，看着浩浩荡荡的游行队伍，高兴地对林彪同志说：“这个运动规模很大，确实把群众发动起来了，对全国人民的思想革命化有很大的意义。”
    几万个系着红袖章的“红卫兵”们，英姿勃勃，像生龙活虎一样，在今天的大会上很引人注目。“红卫兵”是首都大中学生在无产阶级文化大革命运动中创建的革命群众组织，他们表示要一辈子当保卫毛主席、保卫中国共产党、保卫祖国的红色尖兵。在天安门城楼上，在天安门城楼两侧东西的观礼台上，站满了“红卫兵”的代表。在天安门城楼上，在天安门广场上，在广场两侧的东西长安街上，今天都由雄赳赳的“红卫兵”维持会场秩序。
    在大会进行中，师大女附中一个“红卫兵”，登上天安门城楼给毛主席戴上了“红卫兵”的袖章。毛主席和她亲切握手。城楼上下的“红卫兵”，无限欢欣，有的一蹦尺把高，非常激动地说：“毛主席是统帅，我们是他的小兵。”有的说：“毛主席参加了我们的‘红卫兵’，对我们是最大的支持和鼓舞。毛主席给我们撑腰，我们什么也不怕。”
    有一千五百名学生代表，登上天安门城楼，同党和国家领导人一起参加大会，毛主席和林彪、周恩来、江青等同志分批地接见了他们，同他们谈了话，并且在一起照了像。在毛主席接见的时候，学生们兴奋地围在敬爱的毛主席身边，不停地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”
    上午七时半，庆祝大会开始。在《东方红》的乐曲声中，毛主席和林彪等同志出现在天安门城楼上。这时，全场万众欢跃，无数只举着红色《毛主席语录》的手伸向天安门，百万颗火热的心飞向毛主席，百万双闪耀着革命豪情的眼睛仰望着毛主席。
　　当人们看到敬爱的毛主席身穿一套朴素的布军装时，情绪更加激动。他们说：“毛主席穿上军装，我们感到更加亲切。毛主席永远和我们战斗在一起。”有的说：“有了毛主席这样的最高统帅，我们感到无限幸福。我们要当一辈子毛主席的好战士，跟着毛主席闹一辈子革命。”
    庆祝大会由中共中央政治局委员、中央文化革命小组组长陈伯达同志主持。他在致开会词时说：“我们伟大的领袖，伟大的导师，伟大的舵手毛主席，今天在这里同大家见面。（群众热烈向毛主席欢呼）毛主席时时刻刻都是同群众在一起的。他的心，永远向着群众。我们这次无产阶级文化大革命，是毛主席亲自领导的。他今天同大家见面，大大鼓舞我们，将大大推动文化大革命前进。”
    林彪同志在全场暴风雨般的掌声中讲话。
    林彪同志代表毛主席和党中央向大家问好。
    林彪同志说：
    “毛主席提出的无产阶级文化大革命，是共产主义运动中的伟大创举，是社会主义革命的伟大创举！
    “无产阶级文化大革命，就是要消灭资产阶级思想，树立无产阶级思想，改造人的灵魂，实现人的思想革命化，挖掉修正主义根子，巩固和发展社会主义制度。
    “我们要打倒走资本主义道路的当权派，要打倒资产阶级反动权威，要打倒一切资产阶级保皇派，要反对形形色色的压制革命的行为，要打倒一切牛鬼蛇神！
    “我们要大破一切剥削阶级的旧思想，旧文化，旧风俗，旧习惯，要改革一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑，我们要扫除一切害人虫，搬掉一切绊脚石！
    “我们要大立无产阶级的权威，要大立无产阶级的新思想，新文化，新风俗，新习惯。一句话，就是要大立毛泽东思想。我们要让亿万人民掌握毛泽东思想，让毛泽东思想占领一切思想阵地，用毛泽东思想来改变整个社会的精神面貌，让毛泽东思想这个伟大的精神力量，变成伟大的物质力量！
    “这次文化大革命，是关系到我们党和国家命运的大事，是关系到我们党和国家前途的大事！
    “要搞好这场文化大革命，靠什么呢？靠伟大的毛泽东思想，靠群众的智慧和力量！”
    林彪同志说：“我们有毛主席的英明领导，掌握了毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器，就能够所向披靡，攻无不克，取得无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利！”
    林彪同志说：“我们要在毛主席的领导下，向资产阶级意识形态、旧风俗、旧习惯势力，展开猛烈的进攻！要把反革命修正主义分子，把资产阶级右派分子，把资产阶级反动权威，彻底打倒，打垮，使他们威风扫地，永世不得翻身！”
    周恩来同志接着在大会上讲话。周恩来同志说：“党中央刚刚开过了第十一次全体会议。这次会议是在毛主席亲自主持下进行的。这是一次具有伟大历史意义的会议。这次会议的成功，是毛泽东思想的新胜利。
    “这次会议通过的十六条，是在毛主席亲自领导下制定的，是无产阶级文化大革命的纲领。一切革命的同志，都要认真地学习它，熟悉它，掌握它，运用它。这是我们无产阶级文化大革命的战斗的武器，是我们行动的指针。我们一定要把这个伟大的纲领学好用好，贯彻到我们的实际行动中去。
    “在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们要大破资产阶级思想，大立无产阶级思想，也就是大立毛泽东思想。大海航行靠舵手。我们伟大的舵手，就是毛主席。我们要响应林彪同志的号召，在全党全军全国进一步开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。
      “我们一定要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把社会主义的中国建设成为无产阶级的铁打的江山，完成中国人民和世界革命人民赋予我们光荣的历史使命。”
    林彪同志和周恩来同志讲话的过程中，广场上百万群众一次又一次地振臂高呼：“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“伟大的中国共产党万岁！”“伟大的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    北京大学的代表聂元梓和北京、哈尔滨、长沙、南京等地的大中学生，在大会上先后讲话。他们满怀对伟大领袖毛主席无限深厚、无限诚挚的感情，满怀全国亿万革命师生一定要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的钢铁意志，决心把毛泽东思想接过来传下去，保证我们社会主义铁打的江山永不变色。他们说：
      “我们国家正在伟大领袖毛主席领导下进行着史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，这是一场具有世界意义的革命。我们一定要粉碎旧世界，创造新世界，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。”
      “大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳，干革命靠的是毛泽东思想。我们最衷心祝愿最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆。我们一定听毛主席的话，关心国家大事，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。我们一定遵循毛主席的教导，在大风大浪中经风雨，见世面，作无产阶级革命事业最可靠的接班人。”
      “毛主席是我们心中最红最红的太阳。中国人民的革命从来不是风平浪静的，我们要牢记毛主席的教导，在大风大浪中锻炼自己，考验自己。我们誓死保卫党中央、保卫毛主席。我们的前面有刀山，有火海，但是也有毛泽东思想的光辉灯塔。在毛泽东思想指引下，我们一定会胜利。”
      “毛主席和我们站在一起。这是我们一生中最重要最幸福的时刻。我们要一辈子读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好学生。”
    各地革命学生充满革命激情的讲话，在天安门广场上激起了长时间的雷鸣般的掌声。
    庆祝大会结束后，百万群众组成的无产阶级文化革命大军，浩浩荡荡地通过天安门广场，接受伟大领袖毛主席的检阅。首都和来自全国各地的大中学校革命师生，首都的工人、农民、人民解放军指战员和机关干部，斗志昂扬，意气风发，精神抖擞地从天安门广场通过。他们在这里向毛主席和党中央表示，坚决拥护党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定，拥护党的八届十一中全会公报，一定要做无产阶级文化大革命的闯将，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把社会主义革命进行到底。
    毛主席和林彪、周恩来等同志站在天安门上检阅游行队伍，不时向百万革命群众招手致意。在举行庆祝游行的过程中，毛主席和林彪等同志在天安门上，一再向着广场上的百万革命群众鼓掌。百万群众一遍又一遍地高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，千遍万遍地放声欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
