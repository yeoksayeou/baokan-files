Harriman Wants to Visit Cambodia
Prince Sihanouk Says: Not Welcome

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, August 13th: The Head of State of Cambodia, Prince Sihanouk, announced to foreign journalists this morning that the Royal Government of Cambodia will not welcome the visit of the American Ambassador-at-Large, Harriman, to Cambodia.

	Prince Sihanouk refuted the news from Western news agencies, saying: "I have never invited Harriman, never. Harriman is not a guest I have invited; he is an uninvited guest. This is not the same thing. Invitation and uninvited visit are completely different. This is an urgent clarification that needs to be made."

	Prince Sihanouk said, "Harriman's intention to visit is not only incomprehensible but also unwelcome, because after the United States has been harassing Cambodia every day, it has dealt us a very heavy blow: the Americans even refuse to acknowledge our land borders. This is very serious."

	Harriman was originally scheduled to visit Cambodia in early September. According to the announcement by the White House Press Secretary, Moyers, in Washington on the 12th, Johnson has appointed this former Ambassador-at-Large, who has been specially engaged in promoting the American "peace talks" deception, to oversee the "peace talks" conspiracy.

	At the press conference, Prince Sihanouk strongly condemned the United States' shameless act of including Cambodia's Trota Village and other places within the borders of South Vietnam on its printed maps.

### 哈里曼想要访问柬埔寨  西哈努克亲王说：不欢迎

　　哈里曼想要访问柬埔寨
    西哈努克亲王说：不欢迎
    据新华社金边十三日电　柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王十三日上午向外国记者们宣布，柬埔寨王国政府将不欢迎美国无任所大使哈里曼访问柬埔寨。
    西哈努克亲王驳斥西方通讯社的消息说：“我从来没有邀请过哈里曼，从来没有。哈里曼不是我邀请的客人，他是不请自来。这不是一码事。邀请和不请自来，是断然不同的事。这是需要作的一个紧急澄清。”
    西哈努克亲王说，“哈里曼要前来访问不仅是不可理解的，而且是不受欢迎的，因为美国在每天都对柬埔寨进行骚扰之后，又对我们进行了一次极为沉重的打击：美国人甚至拒不承认我们的陆地边界。这是十分严重的。”
    哈里曼原定九月初访问柬埔寨。据美国白宫新闻秘书莫耶斯十二日在华盛顿宣布，约翰逊已任命这个前一个时期一直专门从事推行美国“和谈”骗局的无任所大使总管搞“和谈”阴谋的工作。
    西哈努克亲王在记者招待会上强烈谴责美国无耻地在它印制的地图上把柬埔寨的特洛塔村和其它一些地方划在南越境内。
