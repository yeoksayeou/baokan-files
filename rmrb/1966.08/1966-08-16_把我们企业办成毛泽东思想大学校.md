	The most beloved Party Central Committee and the most beloved Chairman Mao:

	When we, the revolutionary workers of the entire factory, were joyfully studying the Party Central Committee's decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we then heard the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, which once again gave us great inspiration and encouragement. The entire factory's revolutionary workers enthusiastically cheered, spread the news to each other, and passed on the good tidings. They also, with the firmest resolve, posted declarations of support and implementation of the communiqué. The communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee struck a chord in the hearts of the laboring people. We deeply feel that with the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, this is the greatest happiness for the people of China and the revolutionary people of the world. The communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee is the most powerful and fundamental guarantee for our country to carry out socialist revolution and socialist construction and to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat; it is a great encouragement to the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world; it is a powerful blow to American imperialism and to the Soviet revisionist clique that has betrayed Marxism-Leninism, betrayed the Soviet people, and betrayed the people of the world. It has greatly promoted the revolutionary cause of our country and the world.

	All the Communist Party members, Young Communist League members, and revolutionary workers and cadres of our factory will definitely, under the leadership of the greatest, most beloved, and most wise leader Chairman Mao, and under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take the works of Chairman Mao as the guiding principles for all our work and actions. We will forever faithfully carry out Mao Zedong Thought and bravely defend Mao Zedong Thought. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution struggle, we will fight against all monsters and demons, overthrowing them, exposing them, and eliminating them thoroughly, to ensure the dictatorship of the proletariat and ensure the victory of the socialist cause! We ourselves must use the weapon of Mao Zedong Thought to examine ourselves, break away from old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits, and establish new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, take industry as the main focus, and also learn military, political, and cultural subjects. We must also carry out socialist education movements and criticize the bourgeoisie. In places where conditions permit, we must also engage in agricultural and sideline production. For example, like the Daqing Oil Field, we will turn our enterprise into a school of Mao Zedong Thought.

	Let us advance bravely under the brilliant guidance of great Mao Zedong Thought!

	Let us shout:

	Long live the Communist Party of China!
	Long live the great people of China!
	Long live the invincible People's Liberation Army of China!
	Long live the great and wise leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!

	The Communist Party of China Shanghai Huaguang Match Factory Committee and all revolutionary workers

　　把我们企业办成毛泽东思想大学校最敬爱的党中央最敬爱的毛主席：
    当我们全厂革命职工正在欢欣鼓舞学习党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命决定的时候，接着又收听了党的八届十一中全会的公报，又一次给了我们极大的振奋和鼓舞。全厂革命职工热烈欢呼，奔走相告，互传喜讯，并以最坚定的信心，纷纷贴出了拥护和贯彻执行公报的决心书。党的八届十一中全会公报，字字句句都讲到了我们劳动人民的心坎里。我们深深感到有党中央、毛主席的英明领导，这是我国人民和世界革命人民的莫大幸福。党的八届十一中全会公报，是对我国进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设、巩固无产阶级专政最有力最根本的保证；是对亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和世界各国人民的莫大鼓舞；是对美帝国主义和背叛马克思列宁主义、背叛苏联人民和全世界人民的苏联修正主义集团的有力打击。它大大推动了我国革命和世界革命事业。
    我厂全体共产党员、共青团员和广大革命工人、革命干部，一定要在最伟大的、最敬爱的、最英明的领袖毛主席的领导下，在毛泽东思想伟大红旗指引下，把毛主席的书作为我们一切工作、一切行动的指导方针。我们永远忠实地贯彻毛泽东思想，勇敢地捍卫毛泽东思想。我们要在这场无产阶级文化大革命斗争中，将一切牛鬼蛇神斗倒斗臭斗彻底，确保无产阶级专政，确保社会主义事业胜利前进！我们自己一定要以毛泽东思想武器对照自己，破旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，立新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯。我们一定要遵照毛主席的教导，以工为主，也要兼学军事、政治、文化，也要搞社会主义教育运动，也要批判资产阶级。在有条件的地方，也要从事农副业生产。例如大庆油田那样，把我们的企业办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    让我们在伟大的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下奋勇前进！
    让我们高呼：
    中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的中国人民万岁！
    战无不胜的中国人民解放军万岁！
    伟大的英明的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    中共上海华光火柴厂委员会和全体革命职工
