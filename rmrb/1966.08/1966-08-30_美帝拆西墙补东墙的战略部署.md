The U.S. imperialists are shifting the focus of their counter-revolutionary global strategy to Asia. With the arrogance of a teacher from the play "The Fisherman's Revenge," they have come knocking on our door, ready to engage in a serious confrontation with the peoples of Asia.

First, let's take a look at the deployment of U.S. imperialists in Asia, particularly around China.

Currently, out of the 21 divisions and 10 brigades of the U.S. ground forces, the number deployed in the Asia-Pacific region has increased from 4 divisions to 7 divisions and 4 brigades, accounting for approximately 34% of the total U.S. ground forces.

Out of the 938 ships of various types in the U.S. Navy, the Pacific Fleet now has over 500. Out of the 23 aircraft carriers in the entire U.S. fleet, the Pacific Fleet has 14.

The U.S. Air Force and Navy aircraft deployed in Asia and the Pacific total over 5,000, while those deployed in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the Atlantic regions total only around 3,000.

To adapt to the needs of expanding aggression in Asia, the U.S. has distributed four of its eight logistics command centers in Asia. Simultaneously, it is hurriedly expanding and building numerous military bases in Thailand, South Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Okinawa, Japan, South Korea, and other places.

To adapt to the needs of expanding aggression in Asia, U.S. imperialists have also instructed the Japanese and South Korean puppet regimes to form the "Northeast Asia Military Alliance" and the "Asian Anti-Communist Alliance." They are also providing substantial aid to the Indian reactionaries to establish what is called the "wall to contain China."

The U.S. imperialists' shift of strategic focus to Asia has received full cooperation and active support from the Soviet revisionist leadership. The Soviet revisionist leadership has implemented a policy of appeasement in Europe, selling out the interests of the German Democratic Republic and other Eastern European socialist countries. They have engaged in "détente" with U.S. imperialists, reaching a tacit agreement to "freeze" the European situation, allowing the U.S. to free up its hands to concentrate on dealing with the peoples of Asia. In Asia, the Soviet revisionist leadership has colluded with Indian reactionaries and Japanese militarists, conspiring with the U.S. in Vietnam to carry out the plot of "bombing to force negotiations," jointly planning the encirclement of China, and acting as the chief accomplice of U.S. imperialist counter-revolutionary strategy.

The U.S. imperialists and their cronies are baring their fangs and making fierce advances, appearing quite intimidating. In reality, the U.S. imperialists' shift of their strategic focus to Asia only further exposes their paper tiger nature.

Comrade Mao Zedong has told us: "In human history, any reactionary force that is about to perish will always make a final struggle against the revolutionary forces. Some revolutionaries are often deceived by this outward strength but inner weakness for a period, failing to see that the enemy is about to be destroyed and that they are about to win."

The U.S. imperialists are precisely such a reactionary force on the verge of perishing. Their shift of strategic focus to Asia does not indicate that they have any significant strength, nor does it indicate that they have any way to save themselves from failure. It is merely a manifestation of their final struggle.

Faced with the revolutionary storms in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the U.S. imperialists are being beaten everywhere and are hard-pressed to cope. Especially in Asia, where the revolution is developing the fastest and achieving the greatest victories, the U.S. imperialists have suffered the most humiliating defeats. The great victory of the Vietnamese people's resistance against the U.S. has put the U.S. imperialists in danger of being driven off the "extremely important historical stage" of Southeast Asia. The Chinese people, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are implementing a thorough revolutionary and anti-U.S. policy, and are the most resolute and powerful force in supporting the anti-U.S. struggles of the peoples of various countries. Therefore, the U.S. imperialists regard China as the "most frightening and serious threat," as their "main opponent." The U.S. is forced to change its global strategic deployment, which is a reflection of the fierce development of the world revolutionary tide and the result of being stirred up by the anti-U.S. struggles of the Chinese and Asian peoples.

The U.S. imperialists' concentration of their main forces in Asia is a self-inflicted trap, a self-invited trouble. They cannot extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Asian peoples but have instead provided the Asian peoples with a great opportunity to show their mettle. Asia has powerful revolutionary forces, with millions of heroes who oppose U.S. imperialism. They have rich experience in waging people's wars. The 300,000 U.S. troops have been beaten to a pulp by 31 million Vietnamese people. Even if they bring in more soldiers, more warships, and more aircraft, what good will it do? To be honest, if the U.S. imperialists' troops were stationed in Europe and America, the Asian peoples would have no way to destroy them. Now that they have delivered themselves to our doorstep, the Asian peoples can only express their welcome. The more the U.S. imperialists invest their forces in Asia, the more they will be trapped in Asia and unable to extricate themselves, and the more they will dig a deeper grave for themselves in Asia.

The U.S. doing this will not only fail to save the crisis it faces in Asia but will deepen the various contradictions inherent in its policy of aggression. Its expansion of aggression in Asia will further mobilize the peoples of the world to oppose it and mobilize the American people to oppose it. It will withdraw its forces to Asia, and the Western European "allies" under its control will seize the opportunity to "rebel" and grab U.S. positions. The days of U.S. imperialism will be even harder.

The U.S. imperialists have spread their operations wide, dispatching troops to guard every place. They can only demolish the western wall to repair the eastern wall, attending to one thing and neglecting another. This side is tight, that side is loose. This is a fatal exposure of the weakness of U.S. imperialist global strategy. The anti-U.S. struggles of the peoples of the world are united. The U.S. imperialists can be divided. The Asian peoples attracting a large number of U.S. troops will create favorable conditions for the greater rise of anti-U.S. struggles in other parts of the world. You hit its head, I hit its feet, and together we attack it, we can eat the U.S. imperialists bit by bit.

Regarding the U.S. imperialists' preparations to adventure and expand aggression in Asia, the attitude of the Chinese people has always been clear. Our government solemnly declares to the world: "We want to warn the U.S. imperialists that no matter where you want to expand the war, no matter what the cost, we will firmly support the Vietnamese people to fight to the end, until all U.S. aggressors are completely driven out of Vietnam and achieve final victory." For the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of other Asian countries and the world, we will also firmly support them to the end. If the U.S. imperialists insist on imposing war on the Chinese people, we will resolutely accompany them. The Chinese people have long understood the temper of this paper tiger, the U.S. imperialists. It is not comfortable unless it is beaten. It comes to beat you, you destroy it a bit, it feels a bit better; destroy it more, it feels even better. You resist firmly and hit it hard, it will behave a bit. The Chinese people fully understand that as long as we destroy the main force of the U.S. imperialists, we will have made the greatest contribution to the world people's revolution. The day the main force of U.S. military power is destroyed will be the day when the revolutions of various countries around the world rise up, and the U.S. imperialists will be completely finished.

    美帝拆西墙补东墙的战略部署
    任谷平
    美帝国主义正在把它的反革命全球战略的重点转移到亚洲来。它拿出《打渔杀家》里的教师爷的派头，找上门来，要同亚洲人民作一番严重的较量。
    我们先来看一下美帝国主义在亚洲，在中国周围，摆下的阵势。
    目前，美国地面部队二十一个师、十个旅中，部署在亚洲太平洋地区的，已从过去的四个师增为现在的七个师、四个旅，约占美国地面部队总数的百分之三十四。
    美国海军各种舰艇九百三十八艘中，太平洋舰队已占五百余艘。美国全部二十三艘航空母舰中，太平洋舰队就有十四艘。
    美国空军和海军的飞机，部署在亚洲、太平洋地区的，共五千余架，而部署在欧洲、非洲、中东、大西洋地区的仅有三千余架。
    为了适应在亚洲扩大侵略战争的需要，美国把现有的八个后勤司令部中的四个，分布在亚洲。它同时在泰国、南越、菲律宾、台湾、冲绳、日本、南朝鲜等地，加紧扩建和新建大量的军事基地。
    为了适应在亚洲扩大侵略战争的需要，美帝国主义还指使日本和南朝鲜傀儡集团拼凑“东北亚军事联盟”和“亚洲反共联盟”，并加紧援助印度反动派，建立所谓“遏制中国之墙”。
    美帝国主义把战略重点转移到亚洲，得到了苏联修正主义领导集团的全面配合和积极帮助。苏联修正主义领导集团在欧洲实行绥靖主义政策，出卖德意志民主共和国和其他东欧社会主义国家的利益，同美帝国主义大搞“缓和”，达成了“冻结”欧洲局势的默契，使美国能够腾出手来，集中力量对付亚洲人民。在亚洲，苏联修正主义领导集团又勾结印度反动派和日本军国主义，串通美国在越南大搞“以炸迫和”的阴谋，共同策划对中国的包围，充当了美帝国主义反革命战略的头号帮凶。
    美帝国主义及其狐朋狗友，张牙舞爪，来势汹汹，看起来似乎挺吓人。其实，美帝国主义把它的战略重点移到亚洲，只能更加暴露它的纸老虎本质。
    毛泽东同志告诉我们：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的，而有些革命的人们也往往在一个期间内被这种外强中干的现象所迷惑，看不出敌人快要消灭，自己快要胜利的实质。”
    美帝国主义就是属于行将灭亡的反动势力。它把战略重点移到亚洲来，绝不表明它有什么了不起的力量，绝不表明它有什么可以挽救自己失败的办法，而不过是进行最后挣扎的表现。
    在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的革命风暴面前，美帝国主义到处挨打，穷于应付。特别是在亚洲，这里的革命发展最快，胜利最大，美帝国主义败得最惨。越南人民抗美战争的巨大胜利，更使美帝国主义面临从东南亚“这个极关重要的历史性舞台”上被赶走的危险。中国人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，执行彻底革命、彻底反美的政策，是支援各国人民反美斗争的最坚决、最强大的力量。因此，美帝国主义把中国看作是“最可怕的、最严重的威胁”，看作是它的“主要对手”。美国不得不改变它的全球战略部署，这是世界革命洪流猛烈发展的反映，是受到中国和亚洲人民反美斗争调动的结果。
    美帝国主义把它的主要力量调到亚洲来，是自投罗网，自讨苦吃。它不可能扑灭亚洲人民的革命烈火，而是给了亚洲人民一个大显身手的好机会。亚洲有着强大的革命力量，有千千万万的反对美帝国主义的好汉，他们有进行人民战争的丰富经验。美帝国主义的三十万大军，被三千一百万越南人民打得焦头烂额。它即使再多搞来几个大兵，几条军舰，几架飞机，又何济于事？老实说，美帝国主义把它的军队放在欧洲、美洲，亚洲人民倒是没有办法去消灭，现在它既然送货上门，亚洲人民只能表示欢迎。美帝国主义越是在亚洲投下更大的力量，它就越要陷在亚洲不能自拔，就越要在亚洲为自己挖掘更大的坟墓。
    美国这样干，不但解救不了它在亚洲面临的危机，反而会加深它的侵略政策所固有的各种矛盾。它在亚洲扩大侵略战争，就会进一步动员世界人民来反对它，动员美国人民来反对它。它把力量抽调到亚洲来，受它控制的西欧“盟国”就会乘机起来“造反”，并抢夺美国的阵地。美帝国主义的日子就更加不好过了。
    美帝国主义的摊子铺得很大，在世界各处都要派兵把住。它要把其他地方的兵力抽出来放在亚洲，只能是拆西墙补东墙，顾此失彼。这边紧了，那边就松了。这是美帝国主义全球战略的致命弱点的大暴露。全世界人民的反美斗争是联成一气的，美帝国主义是可以分割的。亚洲人民吸引住美国的大量兵力，这就给世界其他各地人民反美斗争的更大兴起，创造了有利的条件。你打它的头，我打它的脚，大家群起而攻之，就可以把美帝国主义一口一口地吃掉。
    对于美帝国主义准备在亚洲冒险扩大侵略战争，中国人民的态度历来是明确的。我国政府向全世界庄严宣告：“我们要正告美帝国主义者，不管你们要把战争扩大到什么地方，不管要付出多大的代价，我们都将坚定不移地支持兄弟的越南人民打到底，直到把美国侵略者全部彻底赶出越南，取得最后胜利。”对于亚洲其他各国人民和世界人民的革命斗争，我们也都是坚决支援到底的。如果美帝国主义硬是要把战争强加在中国人民头上，我们就坚决奉陪。中国人民在长期的斗争中，早就摸透了美帝国主义这只纸老虎的脾气。它是不打不舒服的。它来打你，你消灭它一点，它就舒服一点；消灭得多，它就舒服得多。你坚决抵抗，狠狠地打，它才会老实一点。中国人民完全懂得，只要把美帝国主义的主力消灭了，我们就为世界人民革命建立了最大的功劳。美国军事力量的主力被消灭之日，就是世界各国的革命纷纷起来之时，美帝国主义也就彻底完蛋了。
