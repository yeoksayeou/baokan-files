Revolutionary youth should learn from the PLA.

Learning from the PLA is a great call issued by Chairman Mao to the people of the entire nation.

Our revolutionary youth, under the nurturing of the Party and Chairman Mao, have always loved the PLA and learned from the PLA. From a young age, they have aspired to become honorable soldiers of the PLA.

In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, revolutionary youth in primary and secondary schools have taken the PLA as their example, establishing Red Guards and other revolutionary organizations. We enthusiastically support their revolutionary actions.

The broad masses of revolutionary youth are determined to learn further from the PLA in this struggle and to temper themselves into steadfast proletarian revolutionaries.

Revolutionary youth should be like the PLA, always loyal to the Party, loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to the people's revolutionary cause. Everyone should "read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, becoming good soldiers of Chairman Mao." Everyone should study and apply Chairman Mao's works in practice, and work hard on putting them into practice. At present, it is especially important to seriously study Chairman Mao's writings on class and class struggle, and on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is important to seriously study the "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by Chairman Mao. We should take Chairman Mao's instructions as the guiding principle for all our actions and resolutely carry them out. Whatever conforms to Chairman Mao's instructions, we should resolutely carry out. Whatever goes against Chairman Mao's instructions, we should resolutely oppose.

Revolutionary youth should learn from the heroic models of the PLA. In the storms of revolutionary war and class struggle, the PLA has produced a large number of heroes and models such as Dong Cunrui, Huang Jiguang, Lei Feng, Ouyang Hai, Wang Jie, Mai Xiande, and Liu Yingjun. They are all, in revolutionary practice, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, constantly raising their proletarian consciousness, transforming their thinking, and establishing a proletarian worldview of serving the people and the revolution. We should be like these heroes and models, following Chairman Mao through storms and tempests to temper ourselves and grow.

Wang Jie said: "I will do as Chairman Mao says." Liu Yingjun said: "I am determined to do as Chairman Mao instructs and to cultivate myself into a steadfast proletarian revolutionary." This should be our common goal.

Revolutionary youth should be like the PLA, wholeheartedly serving the people, maintaining close ties with the masses, humbly learning from the masses, and in work, carrying out the mass line of "from the masses, to the masses." They should always be faithful servants of the people. Red Guards and all youth revolutionary organizations should take the PLA as their example, resolutely carrying out Chairman Mao's Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, observing mass discipline, protecting the interests of the people, and safeguarding state property.

Revolutionary youth should be like the PLA, daring to struggle, daring to make revolution; skilled in struggle, skilled in making revolution. They should pay attention to methods of struggle and resolutely carry out the policies formulated by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. In struggle, they should resolutely rely on the revolutionary leftists, unite the majority, and concentrate forces to strike at a handful of extremely reactionary rightist elements of the bourgeoisie.

The "Sixteen Points" point out: we should use struggle through words, not struggle through violence. This not only applies to handling contradictions among the people but also to struggling against those in power who are taking the capitalist road. Truth is in the hands of the proletariat, and state power is in the hands of the proletariat. Using the method of struggle through words, we can overthrow those in power who are taking the capitalist road. Struggle through words means fully exposing and deeply criticizing. Only through struggle through words can we thoroughly expose the counterrevolutionary ugly faces of those ghosts and snakes, thoroughly uproot the roots of revisionism, thoroughly overthrow, defeat, and expose them. Only through struggle through words can we, through these negative teachers, educate ourselves and the masses, and thoroughly eliminate the poison they have spread among the masses.

Revolutionary youth should learn to swim while swimming, and learn to make revolution while making revolution. We should be good at constantly summarizing experiences. If something is done correctly, we should persist in doing it and not waver. If something is done incorrectly, or not entirely correctly, due to lack of experience, we should correct it in time. This is how to be a good student of Chairman Mao.

Revolutionary youth should be like the PLA, striving to study Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely carrying out Mao Zedong Thought, actively propagating Mao Zedong Thought, bravely defending Mao Zedong Thought, and using Mao Zedong Thought to guide all their actions. We should follow Chairman Mao in making revolution for life, studying Mao Zedong Thought for life, and transforming our thinking for life.

    革命青少年要向解放军学习
    向解放军学习，是毛主席向全国人民发出的伟大号召。
    我们革命的青少年，在党和毛主席的哺育下，从来都热爱解放军，学习解放军。他们从小就立志要当一名光荣的解放军战士。
    在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，大、中学校的革命青少年，以解放军为榜样，建立了红卫兵和其他革命组织。我们热烈地支持他们这种革命行动。
    广大革命青少年，决心在这个斗争中，进一步向解放军学习，把自己锻炼成为坚强的无产阶级革命战士。
    革命的青少年，应当像解放军那样，永远忠于党，忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于人民的革命事业。人人都要“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。”人人都要活学活用毛主席著作，在用字上狠下功夫。在当前，特别要认真学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，关于无产阶级文化大革命的论述，认真学习毛主席亲自主持制定的十六条。要把毛主席的指示，当作一切行动的指针，坚决贯彻执行。凡是符合毛主席指示的，我们就坚决照办。凡是违背毛主席指示的，我们就坚决反对。
    革命的青少年，要向解放军的英雄模范学习。在革命战争和阶级斗争的风暴中，解放军涌现了董存瑞、黄继光、雷锋、欧阳海、王杰、麦贤得、刘英俊等大批英雄模范。他们都是在革命的实践中，以毛泽东思想为武器，不断提高自己的无产阶级觉悟，改造思想，树立起一切为人民、一切为革命的无产阶级世界观。我们要像这些英雄模范那样，跟着毛主席在大风大浪中锻炼自己，使自己成长起来。王杰说：“毛主席怎样说的，我就怎样做。”刘英俊说：“决心按毛主席讲的去办，把自己培养成为坚强的无产阶级的革命战士。”这应当成为我们青少年共同的努力目标。
    革命的青少年，要像解放军那样，全心全意为人民服务，密切联系群众，虚心向群众学习，在工作中执行从群众中来、到群众中去的群众路线，永远做人民的忠实的勤务员。红卫兵和一切青少年的革命组织，要以解放军为榜样，坚决执行毛主席制定的三大纪律八项注意，遵守群众纪律，保卫人民利益，保卫国家财产。
    革命的青少年，要像解放军那样，敢于斗争，敢于革命；善于斗争，善于革命。要讲究斗争方法，坚决执行毛主席和党中央制定的政策。在斗争中，要坚决依靠革命的左派，团结大多数，集中力量打击一小撮极端反动的资产阶级右派分子。
    十六条指出：要用文斗，不用武斗。这不仅适用于处理人民内部矛盾，而且也适用于斗争走资本主义道路的当权派。真理掌握在无产阶级手里，国家政权掌握在无产阶级手里。我们用文斗的方法，就能够斗垮那些走资本主义道路的当权派。文斗就是充分揭露，深刻批判。只有文斗，才能彻底揭露那些牛鬼蛇神的反革命的丑恶面目，才能彻底挖掉修正主义的根子，彻底把它们斗垮，斗倒，斗臭。只有文斗，才能通过这些反面教员，教育自己，教育群众，彻底肃清他们在群众中散布的毒素。
    革命的青少年，要在游泳中学会游泳，在革命中学会革命。我们要善于不断地总结经验。做得对的，要坚持做下去，不要动摇。如果有些事情由于缺乏经验，做得不对，或者做得不完全对，那就要及时改正。这样做，才是毛主席的好学生。
    革命的青少年，应当像解放军那样，努力学习毛泽东思想，坚决贯彻毛泽东思想，积极宣传毛泽东思想，勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想指导自己的一切行动。我们要跟着毛主席干一辈子革命，学一辈子毛泽东思想，改造一辈子思想。
