The workers at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Seamless Steel Pipe Factory have continuously modified foreign equipment, leading to significant advancements in product variety, quality, and production volume.

According to Xinhua News Agency from Anshan on the 26th, "Foreign equipment is also a paper tiger." This is the unanimous conclusion drawn by the workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Seamless Steel Pipe Factory after re-reading Chairman Mao's statement in "Talk with the American Journalist Anna Louise Strong" that "All reactionaries are paper tigers."

The workers of the Seamless Steel Pipe Factory have come to understand from their personal experiences in socialist construction that Chairman Mao's statement is a great truth. This guiding ideology, which has led to great victories in struggles against enemies, has also led to great victories in socialist economic construction. They have applied Chairman Mao's statement in their struggle against foreign equipment, foreign frameworks, and foreign "authorities" for over a decade, and their revolutionary spirit has grown stronger with each battle. The conclusion is: foreign equipment, foreign frameworks, and foreign "authorities" appear to be formidable, but in reality, they are all paper tigers.

The Seamless Steel Pipe Factory was built entirely according to foreign designs using foreign equipment. These foreign machines were designed by foreign "authorities" to meet their own needs, and thus contain many irrational elements. What should be done? The answer is: do not be afraid and take them seriously. The workers have launched a revolution, broken the shackles of their minds, removed the "golden bracelets" from their heads, and initiated a revolutionary campaign to modify the foreign equipment.

The process of modifying the foreign equipment has also been a struggle between two ideologies and two paths. Those who cling to foreign frameworks are the vanguards of pouring cold water and blowing cold winds. They believe that workers are "ignorant" and incapable of modifying foreign equipment. They, as "authorities" and "experts," have set countless rules and regulations, claiming that this lacks "scientific basis" and that does not conform to "regulations"; this is not found in foreign countries, and that is not found in books. In short, they believe that it is all impossible. Once, workers performed "surgery" on the large foreign rolling mill, changing it from a single-groove rolling to a double-groove rolling, which increased production and reduced the heavy physical labor of workers. However, the bourgeois "authorities" seized the opportunity of excessive load and bearing wear, writing a four-meter-long big-character poster, hanging it in front of the factory director's office. They said that modifying foreign equipment is "killing the goose that lays the golden eggs." This big-character poster sparked a heated debate throughout the factory. Workers, through the debate, determined that it was not "killing the goose that lays the golden eggs," but rather killing the "Jia Guiren" mentality. From then on, workers' enthusiasm for modifying foreign equipment grew even stronger.

Foreign equipment is a paper tiger, but it must be treated as a real tiger. The most critical piece of equipment in the foreign equipment—the piercing machine—could previously only pierce seamless steel pipes with a diameter of up to 140 millimeters, far from meeting the growing needs of national production and construction. The workers decided to perform "surgery" on it. As soon as the news spread, workers, revolutionary technicians, cadres, technical cooperation activists, revolutionary teachers and students from colleges and universities, and scientific and technological personnel from research departments all took action. They gathered together to form a powerful "people's war" revolutionary torrent. Some conducted scientific measurements, some discussed plans, some designed, and some prepared materials. Everything was decided by the masses, with collective wisdom and effort. In this way, they overcame one difficulty after another, continuously expanding the diameter six times. Now, steel pipes with a diameter of 177 millimeters can also be pierced; six types of large-diameter seamless steel pipes that were previously unable to be produced are now being produced.

The workers of the Seamless Steel Pipe Factory have actively applied Chairman Mao's great and wise strategic thought that "All reactionaries are paper tigers" to continuously modify foreign equipment. Over the past decade, they have implemented thousands of technological innovations. From the first foreign piercing machine to the rolling mill, heating furnace, sizing machine, and even to the cutting machine, almost every piece of foreign equipment has undergone multiple modifications. This has led to significant advancements in product variety, quality, and production volume, with production exceeding the original design level by nearly onefold. Various types of special-shaped and precision steel pipes are now being produced in large quantities. In the past two years, the production of alloy steel pipes has exceeded the total of the past ten years by onefold. Some varieties have already surpassed or caught up with international advanced levels.

    洋设备洋框框洋“ 权威”统统是纸老虎
    鞍钢无缝钢管厂职工对洋设备进行不断改造，使产品品种、质量、产量都出现了大跃进的新局面。
    据新华社鞍山二十六日电　“大洋设备也是纸老虎”，这是鞍钢无缝钢管厂职工重温了毛主席在《和美国记者安娜·路易斯·斯特朗的谈话》中提出的“一切反动派都是纸老虎”的英明论断之后得出的一致的结论。
    鞍钢无缝钢管厂职工从自己在社会主义建设中的亲身经历中认识到，毛主席的这一英明论断是伟大的真理，这一光辉的指导思想不仅用在对敌斗争上可以取得伟大的胜利，用在社会主义经济建设上也同样可以取得一个又一个的伟大胜利。他们运用毛主席这一英明论断，同洋设备，洋框框，洋“权威”一直斗了十几年，越斗革命士气越旺盛。结论是：洋设备、洋框框、洋“权威”，表面上看起来是庞然大物，神乎其神，实际并不可怕，统统是纸老虎。
    无缝钢管厂是完全按照外国设计、用外国的洋设备建设起来的。这些洋设备，都是外国洋“权威”按照他们的需要一手设计的，存在着许多不合理的现象。怎么办？一是不怕，二要认真对待。他们奋起闹革命，粉碎了思想上的枷锁，拿掉了人们头上的“紧箍咒”，掀起了改造大洋设备的革命热潮。
    他们改造大洋设备的过程，也是一场两种思想、两条道路斗争的过程。那些死抱着洋框框不放的资产阶级技术“权威”，是泼冷水、吹冷风的急先锋，他们认为工人是“大老粗”，无力改造洋设备，他们以“权威”、“专家”自居，摆出无数的清规戒律，说这个没有“科学根据”，那个不合“规章制度”；这个外国没有，那个书上找不到……。总之，他们认为一百个不行。有一次，工人给大洋轧管机动了“手术”，改原来的单槽轧管为双槽轧管，既提高了产量，又减轻了工人的笨重体力劳动。可是资产阶级“权威”老爷们，却抓住了负荷过大、轴承磨损这个“小辫子”，写了一张长达四米的大字报，挂在厂长办公室门前，他们说，改革大洋设备是“杀鸡取蛋”。这张大字报引起了轰动全厂的大辩论。工人们从辩论中认定，决不是什么“杀鸡取蛋”，而是杀掉“贾桂思想”。从那时候起，工人们改造大洋设备的劲头更足更大了。
    大洋设备是个纸老虎，但是要当真老虎去对待。大洋设备中的最关键设备——穿孔机，过去最大限度只能穿孔径一百四十毫米的无缝钢管，远远满足不了国家生产建设日益发展的需要。职工们决定给它动“手术”。消息一传出，全厂工人、革命的技术人员、干部迅速地行动起来，技术协作积极分子、大专学校的革命师生、研究部门的科学技术人员，都前来出谋献策，很快汇集成一股强大的“人民战争”革命洪流。有的搞科学测定，有的讨论方案，有的搞设计，有的搞备料，一切由群众作主，群策群力。就这样，他们闯过一道道难关，连续六次扩大了孔径。现在，直径一百七十七毫米的钢管也能穿孔了；原来不能生产的六种大口径的无缝钢管，现在生产出来了。
    无缝钢管厂职工活学活用毛主席的“一切反动派都是纸老虎”的伟大英明的战略思想，对大洋设备进行了不断改造。十多年来，他们实现了数千项技术革新，从头一台洋设备穿孔机开始，到轧管机、加热炉、整径机，一直到剪切，几乎每台大洋设备都进行了多次改造，使产品品种、质量、产量都随着出现了大跃进的新局面，产量超过原设计水平近一倍，异型钢管和精密钢管大批生产出来。最近两年来，合金钢管的产量比过去十年的总和还多一倍，一些品种已超过或赶上了国际先进水平。
