The revolutionary initiative of breaking the "Four Olds" and establishing the "Four News," led by the Red Guards in the capital and various regions, has received even broader and more enthusiastic support from the vast number of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals across the country. Workers, peasants, and Red Guards are fighting side by side, launching a fierce attack on all the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes, forming an irresistible mighty torrent. Any stubborn old forces will be completely swept away by this torrent, and all the ghosts and monsters attempting to obstruct this torrent will be struck down.

The mighty storm of sweeping away the "Four Olds" has swept through every city across the country in recent days. The broad masses of Red Guards and workers and peasants are spirited, full of fighting spirit, determined to press on and expand their victories, uprooting the stinking roots of the bourgeoisie and feudal classes and any breeding grounds for revisionism, thoroughly changing the spiritual face of the entire society with Mao Zedong Thought.

In recent days, the young Red Guards and revolutionary students in cities such as Wuxi, Xuzhou, Suzhou, Changzhou, Nantong, Zhenjiang, and Yangzhou in Jiangsu Province, with the enthusiastic support and cooperation of the broad masses of workers and peasants, have launched a fierce attack on the "Four Olds." In Suzhou, the workers of the Cai Zhi Zhai candy shop smashed a sign that had hung for over ninety years and replaced it with a new sign for the "Red Flag" store. The crowd on the street applauded enthusiastically. An old worker in the shop said, "We smashed this black sign, crushed the capitalist's arrogance, and boosted our own morale." The East Lin Primary School in Wuxi, originally named after the site of the East Lin Academy where the Eastern Forest Party gathered to study during the Ming Dynasty, decided that these reactionary scholars could no longer pollute their socialist school. They immediately changed the school's name to Red Guards Primary School. Workers from the Tangzha Dashi Factory in Nantong organized a shock team, climbed up to the clock tower at the factory gate, and chiseled off the four characters "Dashi Factory" inscribed by the big bureaucrat, big landlord, and big capitalist Zhang Jian, renaming it the Nantong First Cotton Textile Factory. Workers from the Threshing Machine Factory in Zhenjiang drove propaganda cars on the streets, cooperating with the Red Guards in the campaign to break the "Four Olds" and establish the "Four News."

In the heroic city of Nanchang, the revolutionary workers of the "Huang Qingren Pharmacy" were inspired by the Red Guards to rise up in revolution, taking up hammers to smash the four characters "Huang Qingren Pharmacy" that had hung for over 140 years, replacing them with a new sign for the "Anti-Capitalist Pharmacy" that matched the "Xingwu" store across the street. The revolutionary workers of the "Yangming Road Store" smashed the store name that had been erected to summon the spirits of the feudal big officials and big landlords Wang Yangming, replacing it with the new sign "Red Guards Commercial Center." When the Red Guards changed the name of the "Southeast Commercial Store" that had used the capitalist's sign to "East Wind Commercial Store," the store and the street were immediately filled with the sound of firecrackers and applause, and the people shouted in unison, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "The East Wind prevails over the West Wind!"

In the suburbs of Nanchang City, on August 24, more than 3,000 poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses, under the scorching sun, held high portraits of Chairman Mao and Mao's quotations, carried determination letters, and held a rally to support the revolutionary rebellious spirit of the Red Guards. The rally decided to abolish the old name "Hufang" and rename it "East Is Red" People's Commune, responding in action to the Red Guards' revolutionary initiative to sweep away the "Four Olds."

The revolutionary tide of sweeping away the "Four Olds" has recently swept through the streets and alleys of various cities in the northeastern border province of Jilin. Several thousand Red Guards from various middle schools in Tonghua City, located in the Changbai Mountains, took to the streets to smash old shop signs that carried the colors of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, changed some street names, and propagated Mao Zedong Thought everywhere. The revolutionary workers of the White City National Medicine Store, with the help of the Red Guards, smashed two gourd-shaped signs that had hung for 32 years in front of the Guangsheng Hall, which were originally hung by a big capitalist. The revolutionary young people of Jilin City declared, "We will attack all the positions of the bourgeoisie and block all the channels for the restoration of capitalism." This city's "Fuyuan Hall" food store, with the help of some revolutionary young people, smashed a sign that had hung for over 100 years. In Changchun City, revolutionary workers specially set up broadcasting stations for the Red Guards to give speeches, propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and criticize all old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits.

In Henan, the Red Guards and workers and peasants in cities such as Luoyang, Kaifeng, Xinxiang, Anyang, Jiaozuo, Hebi, and Xuchang launched fierce attacks on the "Four Olds." After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was launched, the broad masses of workers and peasants and the young Red Guards could no longer tolerate the situation where newly built cinemas, theaters, parks, and newly constructed roads in Luoyang after liberation were named after relics from the feudal era. They said, "All the achievements we have made in socialist construction are victories of Mao Zedong Thought. We will not allow the bourgeois gentlemen to use the revolutionary fruits of the laboring people to erect monuments and biographies for emperors and generals." The revolutionary workers of the Wangcheng Park, inspired by the Red Guards, enthusiastically changed the park's name to "Labor People's Park." In Kaifeng City, many revolutionary workers and Red Guards fought side by side, smashing old signs and decorations in some stores. The revolutionary workers of the Yuanlong, Yifenghou Stores, and Wang Dachang Tea Shop, together with the Red Guards, smashed the old signs and replaced them with new, shining red signs. The workers were extremely excited and sang the song "The East Is Red" in unison. In Jiaozuo City, when the revolutionary young people and revolutionary workers changed the names of some barbershops together, the cheers, applause, and slogans of "Long live Chairman Mao!" echoed outside the shop doors. The revolutionary masses of Xuchang City overturned a plaque with the words "Upright and Honest" inscribed by the traitor Yuan Shikai on a door, and people said it was smashed just right. They enthusiastically shouted, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!"

In the city of Xining, Qinghai Province, the fearless revolutionary rebellious spirit of the young revolutionaries received firm support from the broad revolutionary workers, revolutionary cadres, and poor and lower-middle peasants. The workers of the original Dashizi Department Store and Yima Street Theater, inspired and encouraged by the revolutionary young people, respectively changed their stores and theaters to new names with revolutionary significance. The workers of the national model enterprise, Xining Transportation Vehicle Factory, carried a giant portrait of Chairman Mao, beat drums, and paraded through the streets, vowing to be the backbone of the revolutionary young people. The poor and lower-middle peasants of the Mafang Commune, to express their most enthusiastic and resolute support for the revolutionary rebellious spirit of the revolutionary young people, changed the original Mafang Commune to the Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Commune together with the revolutionary students.

The streets of Urumqi have been filled with a hot revolutionary atmosphere in recent days. Many stores have prominently hung portraits of Chairman Mao and quotations from Chairman Mao, as well as red banners with slogans such as "Carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end" and "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought." Inside and outside the counters, there are countless big-character posters, determination letters, and initiative letters calling for the destruction of the old and the establishment of the new. Some store signs with feudal, capitalist, and revisionist colors have been replaced with new signs such as "Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers," "Revolution," "Cultural Revolution," and "Anti-American." Some revolutionary workers of restaurants and inns have broken old rules and customs and established the operational ideology of facing the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The revolutionary workers of the Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Dining Hall (originally "Hongchun Garden Restaurant") and other restaurants, with strong class feelings, starting from the needs of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, began to supply a large number of cheap and delicious dishes to the customers, which was welcomed by the masses.

The streets of Lhasa have also been boiling in recent days. Hundreds of Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students from the Tibet Normal School and Lhasa Middle School, carrying a giant portrait of Chairman Mao, holding declarations of war against the old world, beating drums, and marching through the streets, launched a campaign to break the "Four Olds." The Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students of Lhasa Middle School stated in their declaration of war that Lhasa City has been liberated for more than a decade, and the great Communist Party of China and the great leader Chairman Mao have led us to stand up and live a happy life. However, the spiritual shackles set by the three great lords are still tightly fastened around our necks, and we can no longer tolerate it! It is time to settle accounts with them! The Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students of Lhasa City initiated changing the names of places, streets, and buildings with feudal serfdom and superstition colors, and initiated banning performances of dramas with imperialist and feudalist colors, etc. The broad masses of workers and peasants in Lhasa City expressed their determination to be the strong backbone of the young Red Guards and fight side by side to transform Lhasa City into a highly proletarian and revolutionary new city. More than 340 Young Communist League members and youth in Chengguan District of Lhasa City, most of whom are handicraft workers, were so excited by the news of the Red Guards taking to the streets to make a revolution that they took to the streets the next day to make a revolution with the Red Guards. Today, 280 peasants from six townships in Duilong Deqing County in the suburbs of Lhasa City, carrying portraits of Chairman Mao, holding the newly harvested green barley ears, came to Lhasa Middle School to support the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards. They expressed that the emancipated peasants resolutely stand with the revolutionary students, thoroughly uproot all feudal roots, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

The old worker Zhang Shihan, who participated in the "February 7th" strike struggle, is in a warm conversation with the Red Guards of Wuhan City. He expressed his firm support for the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards and his determination to learn from the revolutionary rebellious spirit of the Red Guards.

    横扫“四旧”的革命浪潮，近日来席卷了东北边疆吉林省各个城市的大街小巷。地处长白山区的通化市各中等学校，出动了几千名红卫兵，上街砸碎那些带有封建主义、资本主义和修正主义色彩的商店旧招牌，改换了一些街道的名称，到处宣传毛泽东思想。白城市国药二店革命职工在红卫兵的帮助下，砸碎了广生堂门前挂了三十二年的两个葫芦招牌，这两个招牌原来是大资本家挂起来的。吉林市革命小将们发出的豪言壮语是：“我们要冲击资产阶级的一切阵地，堵塞一切复辟资本主义的孔道。”这个市的“福源馆”食品店在一些革命小将们的帮助下，砸碎了一百多年的旧牌匾。在长春市，革命职工还专门为红卫兵们设立广播站，让他们发表演说，宣传毛泽东思想，批判一切旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯。
