If the enemy dares to invade, we will break its spine

Air Force Active Learner of Chairman Mao's Works "Aviation Hero Squadron" Squadron Leader Dong Xiaohai

I listened with immense excitement to the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. After listening, I was so excited that tears welled up in my eyes. Our party is so wise! Chairman Mao is so great! We are so fortunate! I want to shout a thousand times, ten thousand times: Long live the great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party! Long live our most beloved leader and teacher, Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand times long live!

The communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, every word and every letter in it, shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. It fully expresses the resolve and confidence of the 700 million people. It is a milestone in the new stage of our socialist revolution, a battle cry to mobilize the 700 million people to carry the socialist revolution through to the end. It greatly boosts the morale of the revolutionary people and greatly dampens the arrogance of the enemy. I support it a thousand times, agree with it ten thousand times, and will resolutely carry it out and implement it thoroughly.

The ship sails with the helmsman, and the Chinese revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. On the road of revolution, our beloved Chairman Mao has led us to victory after victory. Today, the plenary session's communiqué calls on us to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher and to carry the socialist revolution through to the end. I will most resolutely respond to the call of the plenary session, and study and apply Chairman Mao's works more diligently, learning and using them in the struggle, together with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers across the country, to thoroughly overthrow the capitalist-roaders in power within the party, thoroughly criticize all the ideological beliefs of the exploiting classes, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and carry the socialist revolution through to the end.

Dear Party Central Committee, beloved Chairman Mao: We have already made all the preparations and are ready to receive the party's orders at any time. If the enemy dares to launch an aggressive war, we will definitely break its spine and decisively, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate them!

    我怀着万分激动的心情，收听了党的八届十一中全会的公报。听完以后，我兴奋得流下了眼泪，我们党太英明了！毛主席太伟大了！我们太幸福了！我要千遍万遍地高呼：伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党万岁！我们最敬爱的领袖和导师毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    党的八届十一中全会公报，它的每一句话，每一个字，都闪烁着毛泽东思想的光辉。它充分表达了七亿人民的决心和信心。它是我国社会主义革命新阶段的里程碑，是鼓舞、动员七亿人民把社会主义革命进行到底的战斗号角。它大长革命人民的志气，大灭敌人的威风。我一千个拥护，一万个赞成，坚决照办，彻底执行。
    大海航行靠舵手，中国革命靠的是毛泽东思想。在革命的道路上，我们敬爱的毛主席引导着我们取得一个又一个的胜利。今天，全会公报又号召我们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把社会主义革命进行到底。我最坚决地响应全会的号召，更加努力活学活用毛主席著作，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，和全国广大工农兵一起，彻底斗倒党内走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底批判一切剥削阶级的意识形态，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把社会主义革命进行到底。
    亲爱的党中央，敬爱的毛主席：我们已经作好了一切准备，随时听候党的命令，如果敌人胆敢发动侵略战争，我们就一定要打断它的脊梁骨，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地把它们消灭光！
