    Taste Bitter, Think Sweet

    Following the initiative of the Party branch, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Liangtong Production Brigade held a "Remember Bitterness, Think Sweetness" day on the eve of the Party's birthday, eating a "bitter meal." They also decided to do this every year. This practice is very educational.

    The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants suffered oppression and exploitation by landlords and capitalists in the old society. This class hatred is as deep as mountains and as vast as the sea, and they truly cannot forget it. However, as time passes and the corrupting influence of the exploiting classes, some people may gradually forget the bitterness they endured in the past. By having a "bitter meal" and recalling the old society's bitterness, they will love the new society even more, always follow Chairman Mao's words, and resolutely walk the socialist path.

    Our second generation was born and raised in sweet times. They do not understand the class bitterness of the old society, and some people "born in luxury, unaware of their fortune." To have them also eat a "bitter meal" and experience the bitterness of the old society, this is a very good education for them, helping to cultivate them into strong successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    On June 30, they ate the "bitter meal," and the next day celebrated the Party's birthday—"July 1." The contrast between the bitter and the sweet is vivid and meaningful. The poor and lower-middle peasants and their offspring will all be willing to celebrate this festival to receive education.

    尝“苦”思甜
    根据党总支的倡议，梁同大队的贫下中农，在党的生日前夕，过了“忆苦思甜日”，吃了“苦餐”。他们还决定以后年年这样。这个做法很有教育意义。
    广大贫下中农，在旧社会，都受过地主、资本家的压迫和剥削。这种阶级恨，如山重，似海深，他们实在难以忘记。但是，时间长了，加上剥削阶级思想的腐蚀，也会有一部分人，对过去受的苦，逐渐淡漠起来。大家吃一顿“苦餐”，重温一下对旧社会的恨，就会更加热爱新社会，永远听毛主席的话，坚决走社会主义道路。
    我们的第二代，甜水里生，甜水里长。他们对旧社会的阶级苦，很不了解，一些人“生在福中不知福”。要他们也来吃顿“苦餐”，体会一下旧社会的苦是什么滋味，这对他们是一个很好的教育，有利于把他们培养成为坚强的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    六月三十日吃“苦餐”，第二天就过党的生日——“七一”。前后对比，一苦一甜，印象鲜明，意义深远。贫下中农和他们的子弟，都会愿意过这样一个节，来受受教育。
