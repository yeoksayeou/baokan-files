Joyous news reaches the Tibetan Plateau
The emancipated serfs cheer the loudest, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

The communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party reached the "Roof of the World," the Tibetan Plateau, and the Tibetan people erupted in the most enthusiastic cheers. From the banks of the Jinsha River to the Altiplano of Ali, from the grasslands of northern Tibet to the Himalayan region, everywhere was a scene of jubilation, with the emancipated serfs cheering the loudest, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

In the Ali region, all cadres and staff of the Ali Regional Committee and soldiers of a certain unit of the stationed troops, who were engaged in flood control, gained boundless strength after listening to the communiqué. They said: With the great thought of Mao Zedong as our guide to action, we can not only achieve one victory after another in the great storms of revolution, but in this flood control struggle, we will definitely achieve victory as well.

In Naqu Town on the northern Tibetan grasslands, people, with hearts full of excitement, carried the giant portrait of our beloved leader Chairman Mao and enthusiastically cheered, "Long live Chairman Mao!" The celebrations continued until late into the night.

The communiqué reached the eastern part of the plateau in the Hengduan Mountains in the Chamdo region, stirring up a great revolutionary fervor in the valleys and gorges. In the frontier outpost of Gangba County in the southwestern part of the plateau, county and district cadres and staff who were studying the Cultural Revolution spread the news and cheered enthusiastically. Xorlang Cairang, the representative from Gangba County attending the conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works among cadres above the county level in the Southwest Region, said: The communiqué is a great Marxist-Leninist document of the times, a call to arms for deepening the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and it points out the direction for our victory.

In Lhasa, the *Tibet Daily* on the 15th published an urgent notice from the Tibet Autonomous Region Party Committee, requiring all levels of Party committees to immediately propagate and implement the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, making it known to every household and deeply rooted in people's hearts. The cadres of Lhasa municipal organs, employees of enterprises and public institutions, teachers and students of schools, and the urban populace carried out fervent study and propaganda activities for the plenary communiqué. From the early hours of the 14th, cheering crowds appeared on the streets of Lhasa. Groups of Tibetan and Hui ethnic minorities and handicraft workers carried portraits of Chairman Mao adorned with khatas, held up colorful flags, waved bouquets, and held celebratory parades. The sound of gongs, slogans, and cheers echoed through the skies of Lhasa.
