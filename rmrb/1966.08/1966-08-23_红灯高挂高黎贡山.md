Chairman Mao ascended Tiananmen Gate,
Like a red lamp hanging high on Gaoligong Mountain.
It illuminates the heavens brightly,
And warms the hearts of the people!

When the soldiers and officers of a certain border defense platoon of the Kunming garrison, stationed on the southwestern frontier of the motherland, conveyed the joyous news of Chairman Mao, dressed in a majestic military uniform, meeting with millions of revolutionary masses at Tiananmen to the Dulong people living on Gaoligong Mountain, the Dulong people expressed their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and their resolve to forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution with the most beautiful and heartfelt language.

In this border defense platoon, there are many soldiers from various ethnic minorities. Upon hearing the joyous news of the great leader Chairman Mao celebrating the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution with millions of revolutionary masses in the capital, they danced and sang in delight: "Children cannot leave their mother, melons cannot leave their vines, the people of various ethnic minorities on the border cannot leave the great thought of Mao Zedong." They decided to immediately convey this great joyous news to their Dulong brothers, with whom they have formed a close friendship. They quickly compiled programs, made slides, carried portraits of Chairman Mao, and brought quotations boards. Despite the rain, they ascended Gaoligong Mountain, entered the villages, and went deep into the bamboo houses where the Dulong people live, swiftly conveying this great joyous news to their Dulong brothers. Wherever they went, there was a festive atmosphere.

Old man Da Dao Song, with tears of excitement, said: "Chairman Mao ascending Tiananmen Gate is like a red lamp hanging high on Gaoligong Mountain, illuminating the heavens brightly and warming the hearts of the people! Our Dulong people will move forward, with Mao Zedong as our helmsman!" The female cadre of La Wang Zhen village, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, Damu, said, "Chairman Mao is the brightest sun in the hearts of the Dulong people. We Dulong people will forever follow Chairman Mao! With our hands, we will smash the old world and build a new frontier." The Dulong brothers, looking at the giant portrait of Chairman Mao, excitedly told the soldiers, "You have entered our mountain villages, bringing us the great thought of Mao Zedong. We Dulong people will forever listen to the great leader Chairman Mao and never leave the Communist Party!"

    红灯高挂高黎贡山
    毛主席走上天安门，
    好比高黎贡山上挂起了红灯。
    照得通天发亮，
      照得人心变红！
    当驻守在祖国西南边疆的昆明部队某边防连指战员，把毛主席穿着一身威武的军装在天安门和百万革命群众会见的大喜讯，告诉给居住在高黎贡山的独龙族人时，独龙族人用最美、最有感情的语言，表达他们对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，和永远跟着毛主席闹革命的决心。
    在这个边防连队里，有许多兄弟民族战士。他们听到伟大领袖毛主席在首都和百万革命群众同庆无产阶级文化大革命的喜讯，高兴得跳着唱着：孩儿离不开娘，瓜儿离不开秧，边疆各民族人民离不开伟大的毛泽东思想。他们决定马上把这个大喜讯告诉和他们结成亲密友谊的独龙族兄弟。他们赶编了节目，制作了幻灯片，抬着毛主席画像，带了语录板，冒雨登上高黎贡山，走进村寨，深入到独龙人居住的一个个竹楼，迅速把这个大喜讯传给独龙族兄弟。他们走到哪里，哪里就是一片欢腾。
    白发老人达刀松听到这个喜讯，含着激动的泪花说：毛主席走上天安门，好比高黎贡山上挂起了红灯，照得通天发亮，照得人心变红！我们独龙族人往前走，舵手就是毛泽东！拉王尞村的女社长、学习毛主席著作积极分子达姆说，毛主席是我们独龙族人心中最红最红的太阳。我们独龙族人永远紧紧跟着毛主席！用我们的双手砸烂旧世界，建设新边疆。独龙族兄弟看着毛主席的巨幅画像，激动地对战士们说，你们走进我们的山寨村庄，给我们带来了伟大的毛泽东思想。我们独龙族人永远听伟大领袖毛主席的话，一步不离共产党！
