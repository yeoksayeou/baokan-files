We, the poor and lower-middle peasants of the Shiliuzhuang People's Commune in Chaoyang District, listened with immense excitement to the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. This communiqué has given us boundless strength, infinite confidence, and courage. We enthusiastically hail: Long live the great Communist Party of China! Long live, ten thousand times long live, our most beloved leader Chairman Mao!

The communiqué points out that over the past few years, our national economy has developed comprehensively, healthily, and continuously, achieving extraordinarily great successes. This is an ironclad fact. The development of our commune is but one of countless examples. The facts of many years have proven that Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light for us five hundred million peasants, and the people's commune is the path for us to completely rid ourselves of poverty and walk towards prosperity.

Most beloved Chairman Mao, you are the red sun in our hearts. We will definitely strive to read your books and listen to your words, resolutely implement your series of wise decisions over the past four years, and turn our commune into a grand school of Mao Zedong Thought. We will resolutely follow the path you have pointed out: the peasants of the commune should take agriculture as the main focus (including forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries), and also learn military affairs, politics, and culture. We will also master other skills. With a hammer, we can work; with a hoe, we can farm; with a gun, we can fight the enemy; with a pen, we can write articles to criticize the bourgeoisie. We will learn from the People's Liberation Army, emphasize politics, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, resolutely follow the Dazhai path, grasp the revolution and promote production, and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. We will strive to achieve the Third Five-Year Plan and build our country into a great, powerful socialist state.

    公报指出，几年来，国民经济全面健康持续地发展，取得了极其伟大的成绩，这是铁一般的事实。我们公社的发展就是千百万个事例之一。多年来的事实证明毛泽东思想是咱五亿农民的指路明灯，人民公社是我们彻底摆脱贫困，走向富强康庄大道。
    最敬爱的毛主席，您是我们心中的红太阳。我们一定要努力读您的书，听您的话，坚决贯彻执行您近四年来的一系列英明决策，把我们公社办成毛泽东思想的大学校。决心照您指出的，公社农民以农为主（包括林牧副渔），也要兼学军事、政治、文化，也要练好其他本领。拿起锤子会作工，拿起锄头会种地，拿起枪杆子能打敌人，拿起笔杆子能写文章批判资产阶级。我们要大学解放军，突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，坚决走大寨之路，抓革命促生产，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，为实现第三个五年计划，把我国建成一个伟大的富强的社会主义国家而奋斗。
