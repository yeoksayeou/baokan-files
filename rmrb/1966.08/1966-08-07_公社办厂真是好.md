Publicly run factories are indeed great. Farmers should focus on agriculture, and when conditions allow, they should also run some collective small factories. This is beneficial for the mutual promotion of industry and agriculture, helps to gradually narrow the gap between workers and peasants, and is also important for educating and transforming farmers.

Chairman Mao's recent great directives are the beacon guiding the five hundred million peasants towards communism.

Our Malu Commune established industry during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Eight years of practice have proven that farmers focusing on agriculture, and when conditions allow, running some collective small factories, has great benefits and profound significance. Having collectively run small factories benefits the mutual promotion of industry and agriculture and helps to gradually narrow the gap between workers and peasants. The main task of our Agricultural Tools Factory is to manufacture, reform, and repair agricultural machinery and tools, and at the same time, help production teams train repairmen. The workers in our Agricultural Tools Factory all come from the production teams. During busy farming seasons, they disperse to various production teams to provide services. This not only strengthens the relationship between workers and peasants but also ensures that the work done meets the needs of production. Therefore, they are highly welcomed by the broad masses of commune members. They say, "Publicly run industries are great. They are responsive, approachable, provide door-to-door services, and have good attitudes. We are grateful for Chairman Mao's good leadership."

Chairman Mao said, "The serious question is educating the peasants." Running some small factories in the people's communes is also important for educating and transforming farmers. The workers in publicly run factories were originally all peasants from the production teams. Due to the influence of old habits, they were not adapted to the strict organizational and disciplinary requirements of industrial production when they first entered the factory. After long-term collective production training in the factory, they gradually developed stronger organizational and disciplinary consciousness. When peasants enter the factory, everyone engages in labor competitions to learn from each other, catch up, help, and surpass. Production increases, and the honor belongs to the collective. This helps to overcome selfish and individualistic thoughts, and collective consciousness will gradually strengthen.

The repairmen trained by our factory for the production teams perform well after returning to the production teams. The commune members praise them, saying, "These young fellows have returned from the factory with a higher spirit. We should have them come and go frequently." The workers in our factory go to various production teams to work, and through frequent contact with the commune members, they continuously spread collective consciousness and deepened class friendship.

    公社办厂真是好
    农民以农为主，在有条件的时候，兼办一些集体的小工厂，有利于工业农业互相促进，有利于逐步缩小工农之间的差别，对教育和改造农民也有重要的作用
    上海嘉定县马陆公社农具厂支部书记　顾文兴
    毛主席最近的伟大指示，是指引我们五亿农民朝着共产主义方向前进的光辉旗帜。
    我们马陆公社在一九五八年大跃进的时候办了工业。八年的事实证明，农民以农为主，在有条件的时候，兼办一些集体的小工厂，好处很大，意义深远。有了集体办的小工厂，有利于工农业互相促进，有利于逐步缩小工农差别。我们的农具厂的主要任务是制造、改革和修理农业机械和农具，同时还帮助生产队培养修理工。我们农具厂的工人，都来自生产队。农忙的时候，他们就分散到各生产队去服务，这样既密切了工农关系，干出的活又适合生产的需要，所以深受广大社员的欢迎。他们说：“社办工业真是好，叫得应，喊得到，上门服务态度好，我伲（我们）感谢毛主席的好领导。”
    毛主席说：“严重的问题是教育农民。”人民公社办一些小工厂，对教育和改造农民也有重要的作用。社办工厂的工人，原来都是生产队的农民。由于旧习惯势力的影响，他们刚进厂的时候，对工业生产所要求的严密的组织性、纪律性很不适应；经过长时间的工厂集体生产的锻炼，就逐渐地养成了较强的组织性、纪律性。农民进了工厂，大家开展比学赶帮超的劳动竞赛，生产提高了，荣誉是属于集体的。这样，就有利于克服自私自利的思想，集体主义思想就会逐渐增强。
    我们工厂代生产队培训的农机修理工，回到生产队以后，大都表现很好。社员群众赞扬说：“这帮小伙子从工厂回来，风格高了。以后要经常来来去去。”我们厂里的工人到各生产队去工作，在和社员群众的频繁接触中，不断地传播了集体主义思想，加深了阶级友爱。
