On March 18, 1871, the Parisian proletariat raised the revolutionary red flag and, for the first time, shattered the bourgeois state machine through force, establishing the first proletarian dictatorship in human history—the Paris Commune. Marx pointed out: "This is a new starting point of world-historic significance."

The Paris Commune implemented a comprehensive electoral system. Engels said: "To prevent the state and state organs from becoming masters of society instead of its servants," the Paris Commune "placed all administrative, judicial, and educational positions in the hands of those elected by universal suffrage, and stipulated that the electors could recall the elected at any time." In the documents issued by the Paris Commune, it was repeatedly proclaimed to the people: "The people have the right to elect all their leaders," "Only those who are chosen from among you and share your hardships can best serve you," "These officials should be accountable, constantly supervised, and subject to recall at any time."

The members of the Paris Commune were elected in proportion to the population of the twenty districts of Paris, generally one representative for every twenty thousand people, with a total of ninety members. Marx pointed out: "The majority of them were naturally workers, or recognized representatives of the working class."

Although the Paris Commune existed for only seventy-two days before it was crushed, the revolutionary spirit of the heroic Parisian proletariat is immortal. Its experiences, including the experience of its comprehensive electoral system, are extremely precious legacies for the world proletarian revolutionary movement. As Marx pointed out: "The principles of the Paris Commune are eternal and indestructible; before the working class is liberated, these principles will repeatedly manifest themselves."

　　巴黎公社实行的全面的选举制
    一八七一年三月十八日，巴黎的无产阶级高举革命的红旗，第一次用暴力打碎资产阶级国家机器，创立了人类历史上第一个无产阶级专政的政权——巴黎公社。马克思指出：这是“具有世界历史性的重大意义的新起点”。
    巴黎公社实行了全面的选举制。恩格斯说：“为了防止国家和国家机关由社会公仆变为社会主宰”，巴黎公社“把行政、司法和国民教育方面的一切职位交给由普选选出的人担任，而且规定选举者可以随时撤换被选举者。”在巴黎公社发布的文件中，曾一再向人民群众宣告：“人民有权选举自己的一切领导者”，“只有从你们自己中间选出来的、与你们同艰苦共患难的人，才能最好地为你们服务”，“这些人员都应当是负责的、经常受到监督的，并随时可以撤换的”。
    巴黎公社的委员，按巴黎二十个区的居民人数比例选出不同数目的名额，一般是二万人左右选出一名，全部定额是九十名。马克思指出：“其中大多数自然都是工人，或者是公认的工人阶级的代表。”
    巴黎公社尽管只存在七十二天就遭到了失败，但是英勇的巴黎无产阶级的革命精神是永垂不朽的，它的经验，包括它所实行的全面的选举制的经验，是全世界无产阶级革命运动极为珍贵的遗产。正如马克思所指出：巴黎公社的原则“是永存的，是消灭不了的；在工人阶级得到解放以前，这些原则将一再表现出来。”（新华社发）
