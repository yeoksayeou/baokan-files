The Red Guards from Beijing and Tianjin pinned a Red Guard armband on McCune. McCune said, "I firmly support your revolution, and together with everyone, I will definitely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end."

A Xinhua News Agency report from Guangzhou on the 25th stated: The Red Guards from Beijing and Tianjin, who came to Guangzhou to exchange experiences in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, pinned a Red Guard armband on McCune on the 24th. They expressed their determination to learn from McCune's proletarian spirit of iron will and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. McCune, moved, said to the Red Guard youths, "I firmly support your revolution!"

On the morning of the 24th, McCune wore military uniform to welcome these Red Guards. When the Red Guards saw McCune, they joyfully surrounded him and applauded warmly. They said to McCune, "The Red Guards greet you!" McCune replied, "Hello, hello!"

A Red Guard youth from Beijing was the first to pin a Red Guard armband on McCune. He excitedly said to McCune, "Dear Comrade McCune, you are now an honorable Red Guard. We are all Chairman Mao's Red Guards, the red warriors defending the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Our most, most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, is our supreme commander. We guarantee that wherever Chairman Mao points, we will strike, and we will definitely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." McCune said, "You are defending the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and I firmly support your revolution."

Next, a Red Guard from Tianjin pinned a badge with Chairman Mao's portrait on McCune's chest. This Red Guard said to McCune, "The Red Guards from Tianjin greet you. We will definitely learn from your proletarian spirit of iron will, and like you, regard Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle for all our work. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we will bravely lead the revolution and definitely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, without victory, we will not stand down!" McCune also immediately gave one of his badges with Chairman Mao's portrait to this Red Guard. He said, "I learn from you, I learn from Comrade Liu Yingjun, and together with everyone, I will definitely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!"

A Red Guard youth from Beijing joyfully introduced to McCune the moving scene of seeing the great leader Chairman Mao at Tiananmen Square on the 18th. He said: Chairman Mao is very healthy, wearing military uniform, waving to us, which is the greatest encouragement and support for our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We are extremely happy. At that time, everyone jumped up holding the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" McCune became more and more excited as he listened. He said, "We must read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions to be good soldiers of Chairman Mao." The Red Guards unanimously replied, "We will definitely be good soldiers of Chairman Mao."

Finally, McCune led the Red Guards in singing "The Ship Sails on the Sea Depending on the Helmsman." As the song ended, they raised their arms and shouted in unison:

We will definitely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

Long live the Communist Party of China!

Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!

    我们都是毛主席的红卫兵
    北京和天津的红卫兵小将给麦贤得带上了红卫兵袖章。麦贤得说，我坚决支持你们革命，同大家一起誓将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    新华社广州二十五日电　前来广州交流无产阶级文化大革命战斗经验的北京和天津的红卫兵，二十四日给麦贤得带上了红卫兵袖章，表示要学习麦贤得的无产阶级硬骨头精神，誓将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。麦贤得激动地对红卫兵小将们说：“我坚决支持你们革命！”
    二十四日上午，麦贤得穿上军装迎接了这批红卫兵。当红卫兵们见到麦贤得时，高兴地围着麦贤得，热烈鼓掌。他们对麦贤得说：“红卫兵向你问好！”麦贤得说：“你们好，你们好！”
    来自北京的一位红卫兵小将，首先给麦贤得带上红卫兵袖章，并且激动地对麦贤得说：“亲爱的麦贤得同志，你已经是光荣的红卫兵了。我们都是毛主席的红卫兵，是保卫党中央、保卫毛主席的红色战士。最最敬爱的领袖毛主席，是我们的最高统帅。我们保证做到毛主席指到那里，我们就打到那里，一定要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。”麦贤得说：“你们保卫党中央，保卫毛主席，我坚决支持你们革命。”
    接着，来自天津的一位红卫兵把一枚有毛主席像的纪念章戴在麦贤得胸前。这位红卫兵向麦贤得说：“天津的红卫兵向你问好。我们一定学习你的无产阶级硬骨头精神，像你那样，把毛泽东思想当作一切工作的指导方针，在无产阶级文化大革命中，勇当革命闯将，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，不获全胜，决不收兵！”麦贤得也当场把自己的一枚有毛主席像的纪念章回赠给这位红卫兵，他说：“我向你们学习，向刘英俊同志学习，同大家一起，誓将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”
    来自北京的一位红卫兵小将兴高采烈地向麦贤得介绍了十八日在天安门前见到伟大领袖毛主席的动人情景。他说：毛主席非常健康，穿着军装，向我们招手，这是对我们大闹无产阶级文化大革命的最大鼓舞和支持。我们高兴极了。当时，大家都高举着《毛主席语录》跳起来欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”麦贤得越听越激动，他说：“我们要好好读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。”红卫兵们齐声回答说：“我们一定要做毛主席的好战士。”
    最后，麦贤得作指挥，和红卫兵们同声高唱《大海航行靠舵手》；歌声刚停，又一起振臂高呼：
    誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！万万岁！
