In the surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Shanghai and Tianjin have launched a new revolutionary upsurge. On the 23rd, from dawn to midnight, tens of thousands of Red Guards and revolutionary students formed propaganda teams, carrying giant portraits of Chairman Mao, holding up banners that read, "We are the critics of the old world" and "We are the creators of the new world." They marched through the streets, beating drums, singing battle songs, performing propaganda shows, distributing revolutionary leaflets, and posting big-character posters, launching a total attack on old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits, paving the way for the creation of new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits.

The broad masses of commercial workers enthusiastically support this revolutionary action by the young revolutionaries. They inspire each other, fight together, and jointly reform the outdated customs and practices in the commercial sector and service industries that bear the stench of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism. The workers resolutely declare that they will not allow these decayed elements to continue poisoning people's souls and will definitely transform Shanghai into a highly proletarian and revolutionary city.

Shanghai is a city where the bourgeoisie is most concentrated and has long been under the rule of imperialism and domestic reactionaries. Since liberation, the people of Shanghai, under the leadership of the Party, have repeatedly launched attacks on the bourgeoisie and all exploitative class ideologies. Through numerous campaigns to change customs and practices, they have reformed the names of many streets, alleys, shops, and buildings that bear the taste of compradors and the colors of capitalism and feudalism. Today, countless Red Guard warriors and revolutionary workers, in the surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have launched a total attack on the bourgeoisie and all exploitative class ideologies.

The famous Nanjing Road, where countless revolutionary forerunners have fought and shed blood, today sees the young revolutionaries and the broad masses of workers carrying on the revolutionary banner of their predecessors, forming a surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They say: Today, we will make a thorough revolution here, using our iron brooms to sweep away the bourgeois "fragrance" and stench! On the window of one of Shanghai's largest department stores, the Yong'an Company, many big-character posters written by Red Guards and the store's workers are posted, suggesting changing the name to "Yonghong," "Yongdou," "Hongwei," etc. They point out: "Yong'an" is the name given by the old bosses of the old society to perpetually exploit the laboring people. With the bourgeois "Yong'an," there is no iron-clad mountain for us proletarians! This store has long been a people's store, and today we will not allow the stinking sign of "Yong'an" to hang any longer!

At the largest amusement park in Shanghai with a history of fifty years—the Great World, workers and Red Guards together, amidst the cheers of the people, pulled down the several-meter-high sign of "Great World." Before liberation, under the evil sign of "Great World," Shanghai's big capitalists and gangsters had plundered countless people's wealth and corrupted countless souls. Today, when the workers pulled down the last "World" character, thousands of revolutionary masses on the street, in nearby buildings, and in passing buses immediately erupted in thunderous cheers: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!"

Those shop names with the names of capitalists, such as "Xu Zhongdao," "Lei Yunshang," "Shao Wansheng," "Wu Liangcai," etc., also came under fierce attack by the young revolutionaries and workers, and were changed to names with revolutionary significance.

The Shanghai *Wenhui Evening News* accepted the suggestions of the revolutionary masses and changed its name to *Shanghai Evening News* starting from the 23rd. The revolutionary workers of the newspaper unanimously declared: They will hold high the great red banner of invincible Mao Zedong Thought and strive to run a good socialist newspaper.

The Bund, adjacent to the Huangpu River, was the center of imperialist plunder of the Chinese people before liberation. Some of the high-rise buildings here still bear traces of imperialist colors. Red Guards and revolutionary workers made a big fuss here, removing the copper lions placed by imperialists in front of the buildings and erasing the foreign signs on the walls.

The revolutionary tide formed by Red Guards and revolutionary workers fiercely impacted all capitalist and feudalist outdated customs and practices. The revolutionary workers of barbershops proposed revolutionary measures: to completely eliminate all "Afei-style" and Hong Kong-style hairstyles, and immediately cancel services dedicated to the bourgeoisie, such as nail clipping, beauty treatments, and facial massages. In some shops that originally supplied goods for a few people, workers also made revolutionary resolutions: starting from the 24th, they will supply inexpensive and high-quality mass-market goods and better serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They declared that they will thoroughly smash capitalist business ideas and establish socialist business ideas, and will not run their shops as "famous stores" serving the bourgeoisie, but will definitely run the commercial and service industries as big schools of Mao Zedong Thought.

In Tianjin, the Red Guards, inspired by the revolutionary spirit of rebellion from the Red Guards in the capital, wielded heavy hammers and iron brooms, marching through the streets with high spirits, sweeping away the dust of old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes.

On the 23rd, the streets of Tianjin were filled with a revolutionary atmosphere. Red Guards beat drums and gongs, posted big-character posters and slogans everywhere, held meetings and speeches, enthusiastically proposing revolutionary initiatives to change the names of old shops and street alleys to the workers and residents. They said that in the great proletarian cultural revolution, we must thoroughly break the "Four Olds" and resolutely use the new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits of the proletariat to change the face of Tianjin, letting Tianjin put on a brand-new socialist outfit.

The fearless revolutionary spirit of rebellion of the Red Guards was met with the most enthusiastic and resolute support from the revolutionary workers throughout the city. In the commercial center of Tianjin—Binjiang Road, the sound of drums and gongs filled the air all day, and firecrackers exploded. Countless shops removed their old names and replaced them with new names of revolutionary significance. The revolutionary workers of Zhongyuan Company enthusiastically posted a resolution, set up a reception station, and solicited opinions from Red Guards and revolutionary masses on changing the name, finally deciding to change the name to "Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Department Store" based on the suggestions of the revolutionary masses. The revolutionary workers of Tianjin's largest department store—Quanyechang, inspired by the revolutionary spirit of the Red Guards, wielded iron hammers and smashed the three characters "Quanyechang" embedded in the wall for 38 years, replacing them with the new name "People's Department Store." All the revolutionary workers held a celebration meeting, enthusiastically cheering for the birth of "People's Department Store." They said, "Quanyechang" was opened by local bullies and tyrants with the support of imperialism and the comprador bourgeoisie. Before liberation, it was a notorious place for exploiting the laboring people. Today, we have changed it to "People's Department Store," which is a great joy. We must serve the people better and run "People's Department Store" even better. At this time, tens of thousands of people gathered around the department store, unanimously shouting: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao! The revolutionary workers of Beiyang Cotton Mill, with a history of 45 years, held a meeting on the evening of the 23rd and unanimously decided to change the name of Beiyang Cotton Mill, established during the Beiyang warlord era, to "Sixin" Cotton Mill, expressing the revolutionary determination of the entire factory's revolutionary workers to break the old and establish the new. They also changed the original "Jinsan Ding" cotton yarn trademark to the "Workers and Peasants" brand.

    上海天津革命小将和商业职工向剥削阶级“四旧”发动总攻
    挥起革命铁扫帚　横扫一切旧习俗
    许多带有封建主义、资本主义、修正主义腐朽气息的商店字号和服务行业的陈规陋习全被扫除，革命群众热烈欢呼：毛主席万岁！无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    新华社上海二十四日电　在无产阶级文化大革命的激流中勇猛前进的上海，又掀起了新的革命热潮。二十三日从清晨到深夜，成千上万支红卫兵和革命师生组成的宣传小队，抬着毛主席巨幅画像，高举“我们是旧世界的批判者”、“我们是新世界的创造者”的大型横幅，走上街头，擂战鼓，唱战歌，到处演出宣传，散发革命传单，张贴革命大字报，向旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯发动总攻击，为创立新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯开辟广阔的道路。
    广大商业职工，热烈支持革命小将这一革命行动，他们互相鼓舞，共同战斗，一起改革带有封建主义、资本主义、修正主义腐朽气息的商店字号和服务行业残存的陈规陋习。职工们坚决表示，绝不再让这些腐朽的东西继续毒化人们的灵魂，一定要把上海改造成为非常无产阶级化、非常革命化的城市。
    上海是资产阶级最集中的城市，又长期遭受帝国主义和国内反动派的统治。解放以来，上海人民在党的领导下，一次又一次向资产阶级和一切剥削阶级意识形态猛烈进攻，经过多次移风易俗的群众运动，改革许多带有买办气味和资本主义、封建主义色彩的街道、里弄、商店、建筑物等的名称。今天，无数红卫兵战士和广大革命职工又在无产阶级文化大革命的激流中，向资产阶级和一切剥削阶级意识形态发动了总攻击。
    著名的南京路，是无数革命先辈曾经流血斗争过的地方，今天，革命小将和广大职工接过先辈的革命大旗，在这里汇成了无产阶级文化大革命的洪流。他们说：今天我们要在这里彻底闹革命，用我们的铁扫帚彻底扫除资产阶级的“香风”、臭气！在上海最大的百货商店之一的永安公司的橱窗上，张贴了许多由红卫兵和这个商店的职工写的大字报，建议改名为“永红”、“永斗”、“红卫”等。他们指出：“永安”是旧社会大老板企图永远安安稳稳剥削劳动人民而定的名。有了资产阶级的“永安”，就没有我们无产阶级的铁打江山！这个商店早已成了人民的商店，今天我们决不允许“永安”这个臭招牌继续挂下去！
    在具有五十年历史的上海最大的游乐场所——大世界，职工们和红卫兵一起，在人们的欢呼声中，拉下了几米高的“大世界”这块旧招牌。解放前，在“大世界”这块罪恶的招牌下面，上海的大资本家大流氓不知搜刮了多少民脂民膏，不知腐蚀了多少人的灵魂。今天，当职工们把最后一个“界”字拉下地的时候，在马路上，在附近大楼的窗口里，在路过的公共汽车中，数千革命群众立即爆发出雷鸣般的欢呼声：“毛主席万岁！”“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”
    那些以资本家个人名字命名的商店字号，什么“徐重道”、“雷允上”、“邵万生”、“吴良材”等等，也受到了革命小将和职工们的猛烈冲击，换上了有着革命意义的店名。
    上海《新民晚报》接受广大革命群众的建议，从二十三日起改名为《上海晚报》。报社的革命职工一致表示：要更高地举起战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为办好社会主义报纸而奋斗。
    濒临黄浦江的外滩，解放前是帝国主义掠夺中国人民的罪恶活动中心。这里的一些高楼大厦上，还遗留着一些带有帝国主义色彩的残迹。红卫兵和革命职工在这里大闹革命，他们搬掉了帝国主义者安置在大厦门前的铜狮子，铲除了墙壁上的洋标志。
    红卫兵和广大革命职工汇成的革命洪流，猛烈地冲击着一切资本主义、封建主义的陈规陋习。理发店的革命职工提出了革命性的措施：彻底消灭一切“阿飞式”、港式的头发式样，立即取消专门为资产阶级服务的项目，如剪指甲、美容、摩面等。在一些原来只供应少数人需要的商品的商店，职工们也作出了革命性的决议：从二十四日开始供应价廉物美的大众化商品，更好地为工农兵群众服务。他们表示，要大破资本主义经营思想，大立社会主义经营思想，决不把自己的商店办成为资产阶级服务的“名店”，一定要把商业和服务行业办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    新华社天津二十四日电　天津市红卫兵，在首都红卫兵小将们的革命造反精神鼓舞下，抡起千钧棒，举起铁扫帚，斗志昂扬地走上街头，横扫一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯的灰尘。
    二十三日，在天津市的许多街道上充满了革命的气氛。红卫兵们敲锣打鼓，到处张贴大字报、标语，集会演说，热情地向职工、居民提出更改旧商店字号和街道里弄名称的革命倡议。他们说，在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，一定要彻底破“四旧”，坚决地用无产阶级的新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯来改变天津市的面貌，让天津市换上崭新的社会主义新装。
    红卫兵的大无畏的无产阶级革命造反精神，得到了全市革命职工最热烈、最坚决的支持。在天津市商业中心区——滨江道一带，整日锣鼓喧天，鞭炮齐鸣，许许多多商店拔去了旧字号，换上了具有革命意义的新名称。中原公司的革命职工热情地贴出决心书，设立接待站，征求红卫兵和广大革命群众对更改名称的意见，最后在革命群众的建议下，决定改名为“工农兵商场”。天津市最大的商场——劝业场的革命职工，在红卫兵革命精神的鼓舞下，抡起铁鎯头，砸碎了嵌在墙上达三十八年之久的“劝业场”三个字，换上了“人民商场”的新名称。全场革命职工举行庆祝集会，热烈欢呼“人民商场”的诞生。他们说，“劝业场”是恶霸豪绅在帝国主义和封建官僚买办资产阶级的扶助下开办的，解放前，它是远近闻名的剥削劳动人民的“老虎摊”，今天，我们把它改为“人民商场”，这是天大的喜事，我们一定要更好地为人民服务，把“人民商场”办得好上加好。这时聚集在商场周围数以千计的人民群众，齐声高呼：毛主席万岁！万万岁！具有四十五年历史的北洋纱厂革命职工二十三日晚集会，一致决议把在北洋军阀时代建立的北洋纱厂，改名为“四新”纱厂，以表达全厂革命职工破旧立新的革命决心。他们还把工厂原来的“金三鼎”棉纱商标，改为“工农”牌商标。
