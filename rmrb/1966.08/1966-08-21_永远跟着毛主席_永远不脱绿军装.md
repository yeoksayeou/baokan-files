On August 18, Chairman Mao wore the green military uniform of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, with a red badge and a five-pointed star. From his appearance, we saw the heroic spirit of the old Red Army. Chairman Mao started at five in the morning and joined the revolutionary students and masses from the capital and various parts of the country who came to Beijing to celebrate the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is a tremendously inspiring event! This is a great honor for the revolutionary masses of the entire nation, and it is also a great honor for the Chinese People's Liberation Army!

I saw on television that Chairman Mao is in good health, radiant, and full of spirit. I felt deeply moved, extremely happy, and very fortunate!

As I watched the television, I thought: Chairman Mao, at his advanced age, has been working day and night for the revolutionary cause, without rest, and participated in the celebration meeting early in the morning. He spent a long time with the masses in the scorching sun celebrating the Cultural Revolution. How much Chairman Mao loves the proletarian revolutionary cause! How much he loves the people! Chairman Mao's personal participation in this celebration meeting is a great concern for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a great encouragement to the revolutionary masses. Chairman Mao attending this meeting as an old Red Army soldier is the greatest concern, greatest encouragement, and greatest motivation for every soldier in the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

Dear Chairman Mao, I solemnly pledge to you: I will dedicate my life to follow the Party and you, Chairman, in the revolutionary cause. I will spend my life reading your books, listening to your words, and acting according to your instructions, to be your good soldier. I will never take off my green military uniform, to be a soldier of the People's Liberation Army forever, forever holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, following you to brave the storms and waves, and forge ahead courageously! I will follow you in the revolution to the end, uphold and carry forward the glorious revolutionary traditions of our army, pass on the spirit of Jinggangshan. I will ensure that my descendants also follow you in the revolution to the end, for the revolution, fearing neither hardship nor death, climbing the knife mountain, descending the fire sea, fighting bravely, and making the ultimate sacrifice. I will forever remember your teachings, care about national affairs, actively participate in the Cultural Revolution, and resolutely carry the Cultural Revolution to the end.

Finally, I want to shout a thousand times, ten thousand times:

Long live the great Communist Party of China!

Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live the great leader Chairman Mao!

    永远跟着毛主席  永远不脱绿军装
    八月十八日，毛主席穿着中国人民解放军绿色的军装，佩戴着红色的领章和五角星。我们从他老人家身上，看到老红军的英雄气概。毛主席从早晨五点钟起就和首都及全国各地来北京的革命师生代表、革命群众在一起，庆祝无产阶级文化大革命。这是极其振奋人心的大喜事！这是全国革命群众的光荣，也是我们中国人民解放军的光荣！
    我在电视里看到毛主席他老人家身体健康，容光焕发，精神抖擞，从心眼里感到特别激动，特别高兴，特别幸福！
    我一边看电视，一边想：毛主席那么大的年纪，为了革命事业日夜操劳，还不顾休息，一大清早就参加了庆祝大会，长时间和群众一起在烈日下庆祝文化大革命，毛主席他老人家是多么地热爱无产阶级革命事业呀！是多么地热爱人民呀！毛主席亲自参加这个庆祝大会，是对无产阶级文化大革命的巨大关怀，是对革命群众的巨大鼓励。毛主席以一个老红军的身份参加这个大会，又是对我们中国人民解放军每一个战士最大的关怀，最大的鞭策，最大的鼓励。
    敬爱的毛主席，我庄严地向您宣誓：我决心跟着党、跟着您老人家干一辈子革命。我要一辈子读您的书，听您的话，按照您的指示办事，做您的好战士。我要永远不脱绿军装，当一辈子解放军战士，永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，跟随您在大风大浪中乘风破浪，奋勇前进！我要跟着您革命到底，保持和发扬我军革命的光荣传统，把井冈山的精神接过来传下去。要我的子子孙孙也跟着您革命到底，为了革命，不怕苦，不怕死，上刀山，下火海，英勇战斗，不惜牺牲。我要永远牢记您的教导，关心国家大事，积极参加文化大革命，坚决把文化大革命进行到底。
    最后，我要一千遍一万遍地高呼：
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的领袖毛主席万岁、万岁、万万岁！
