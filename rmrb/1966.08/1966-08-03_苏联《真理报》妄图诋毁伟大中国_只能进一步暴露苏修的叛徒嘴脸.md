The Soviet Union's *Pravda* on July 28 published on the third page under the bold headline "Sino-American Dialogue" a statement by the American ambassador to Poland, Gronowski, to a reporter from *U.S. News & World Report* regarding the routine talks between the Chinese and American ambassadors in Warsaw. *Pravda* attempted to use this to hint that China, in the Warsaw talks, had engaged in some sort of "political deal" with the United States over the Vietnam issue. This was an effort to extricate the Soviet leadership from their embarrassing situation after their active promotion of U.S. imperialism's "bombing for peace" plot was exposed, and to shift the blame.

*Pravda*, through this "statement," propagated the idea that the Sino-American Warsaw talks "made it possible to discuss a series of issues facing the two countries, especially those concerning Southeast Asia and the world as a whole." It also claimed that "in light of the Vietnam issue," these talks were "beneficial for a series of reasons" and that "both sides obviously want these talks to continue," and so on.

When *Pravda* published the American ambassador's "statement," it also went to great lengths to add a preface, pretending to say that readers had requested it to "discuss in more detail what it knows" about the Sino-American talks, and claiming that "Chinese publications have not published anything about the nature of these talks," while "these details are reported by the American side," and so on.

*Pravda*'s insidious attempt to cast aspersions on China's firm stance of resolutely supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and of not trading principles, can only further expose the traitorous face of the Soviet leadership.

    苏联《真理报》妄图诋毁伟大中国
    只能进一步暴露苏修的叛徒嘴脸
    新华社二日讯　莫斯科消息：苏联《真理报》七月二十八日在第三版用《中美对话》的黑体大字标题，刊登了美国驻波兰大使格罗诺斯基就中美两国大使在华沙举行的例行的会谈对《美国新闻与世界报道》记者发表的谈话。《真理报》企图借此暗示中国在华沙会谈中同美国就越南问题进行某种“政治交易”，从而摆脱苏联领导集团积极推销美帝国主义的“以炸迫和”阴谋被揭露后的狼狈处境，并开脱其罪责。
    《真理报》通过这篇“谈话”，宣传什么中美华沙会谈“使得能够讨论（中美）两国所碰到的一系列问题，特别是东南亚以及全世界的问题”，而且“鉴于越南问题”，“这些会谈由于一系列原因是有益的”，“双方显然都想使这些会谈继续下去”，等等。
    《真理报》在刊载美国大使的这篇“谈话”时，还煞费苦心地在“谈话”的前面加了一段按语，装模作样地说，读者要求它
  “比较详细地谈一谈所知道的”关于中美会谈的“情况”，并且说什么“中国报刊关于这些会谈的性质一点也不刊登”，而“这些情况是美国方面报道的”，等等。
    《真理报》这种含沙射影地诋毁中国坚决支持越南人民抗美救国斗争、绝不拿原则做交易的立场的卑劣行为，只能进一步暴露苏联领导集团的叛徒嘴脸。
