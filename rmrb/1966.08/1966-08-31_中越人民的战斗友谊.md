At the banquet held to see off the Vietnamese Government Economic Delegation, Vice Premier Chen Yi and the China-Vietnam Friendship Association delegation leader Sun Guangfu spontaneously composed poems:

	Chen Yi
		The South is the front line,
		China is the rear.
		The front line protects the rear,
		The rear supports the front line;
		Defeating the U.S. imperialists is our shared glory,
		Glory, glory, glory,
		Wishing Chairman Mao and Chairman Hu eternal health!

	Sun Guangfu
		China has Mao Zedong,
		Vietnam has Ho Chi Minh;
		The Foolish Old Man can move mountains,
		What is there to fear from the U.S. imperialists!

    中越人民的战斗友谊
    在欢送越南政府经济代表团宴会上，陈毅副总理和越中友协代表团孙光阀团长即兴赋诗
                                     陈毅越
    南是前方，
    中国是后方；
    前方掩护后方，
    后方支援前方；
    打败美帝是我们的共同荣光，
    荣光，荣光，荣光，
    祝胡主席毛主席万寿无疆！
                                      孙光阀
    中国有毛泽东，
    越南有胡志明；
    愚公可移山，
    美帝何所惧！
