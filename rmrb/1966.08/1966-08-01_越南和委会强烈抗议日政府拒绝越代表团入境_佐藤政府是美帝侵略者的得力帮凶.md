The Vietnam Peace Committee strongly protests the Japanese government's refusal to issue entry visas to the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, who are to attend the forthcoming 12th World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs in Tokyo.

New China News Agency, Hanoi, July 30th – According to the Vietnam News Agency, on the 28th, the Vietnam Peace Committee strongly protested the Japanese government's refusal to issue entry visas to the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, who are to attend the forthcoming 12th World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs in Tokyo. At a press conference held here, Nguyen Thanh Le, a member of the Vietnam Peace Committee and head of the Vietnam Peace Committee delegation to the 12th World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, read out a statement expressing this protest.

The statement pointed out that the Vietnamese delegation had made full preparations to participate in this conference. However, the Japanese government, which has always followed the policy of U.S. imperialism, refused to issue entry visas to the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

The statement pointed out that this action by the Japanese government shows that it is extremely afraid of the just voices of the Vietnamese people, and at the same time, further proves that the Japanese government is a stubborn tool and a faithful accomplice of the U.S. imperialist aggressors.

The statement said that the Vietnamese delegation strongly protests against this unreasonable action by the Japanese government.
