Vice Premier Chen Yi Replies to General Secretary of the Lao Patriotic Front Party, Fumi Vongvichit
The Chinese People Will Forever Be a Strong Backbone for the Lao People
Condemning the U.S. Imperialists' Complete Tearing Up of the Geneva Agreement on Laos

	New China News Agency, August 20
	The Chinese Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Chen Yi, wrote a letter on August 20 to the General Secretary of the Lao Patriotic Front Party, Minister of Information, Propaganda, and Tourism of the Lao National United Government, and member of the National Implementation Committee for the 1962 Geneva Agreement on Laos, Fumi Vongvichit, in reply to his letter dated July 23. The letter reaffirms the Chinese people's full support for the Lao people's just struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation until final victory.

	The full text of the reply is as follows:

	Your Excellency,

	I have received your letter dated July 23, 1966, and the attached statement by the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front Party on the fourth anniversary of the signing of the 1962 Geneva Agreement on Laos.

	The statement by the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front Party sternly condemns the U.S. imperialists' consistent sabotage of the 1962 Geneva Agreement on Laos, their expansion of aggression and interference in Laos, and their plot to spread the flames of war in Vietnam and Laos to the entire Indochina Peninsula. It expresses the Lao people's determination to smash the U.S. imperialists' aggressive plots. The Chinese government and people fully support the principled stand elucidated in the statement by the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front Party.

	The U.S. imperialists are the sworn enemies of the Lao people and the peoples of the Indochina countries. The U.S. imperialists have launched a full-scale war of aggression against the Vietnamese people and recently bombed the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, thereby finally and completely tearing up the 1954 Geneva Agreement. In Laos, the U.S. imperialists have long since overthrown the National United Government and launched a war of aggression against the Lao people. U.S. warplanes have carried out indiscriminate bombing of the liberated areas of Laos, and military personnel from the United States and its lackeys, Thailand and South Vietnam, have entered Laos in large numbers. The U.S. imperialists are also actively preparing to send ground troops to directly invade Laos. The U.S. imperialists' actions in Laos have completely destroyed the 1962 Geneva Agreement on Laos. Facts have repeatedly proven that the U.S. imperialists have never respected any international agreement. As Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out, a piece of paper will not make the U.S. imperialists lay down their butcher's knives and become Buddhas, or even slightly more disciplined.

	In the face of U.S. imperialist aggression, the Lao people have waged a heroic and tenacious struggle, dealt heavy blows to the U.S. imperialists, and achieved significant victories. The U.S. imperialists are strong on the outside but weak on the inside. As long as revolutionary peoples do not believe the imperialists' "good words," do not fear the imperialists' threats, and dare to engage in a tit-for-tat struggle with them, they will certainly achieve final victory.

	The peoples of China and Laos are as close as lips and teeth. In the Lao people's struggle against U.S. imperialism, the Chinese people will forever be a reliable and strong backbone for the Lao people. The Chinese people will fully support the Lao people's just struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation until final victory.

	With the highest respect,

	Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
	Chen Yi

	August 20, 1966, Beijing

	New China News Agency, August 20
	The Chinese Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Chen Yi, received a letter dated July 23 from the General Secretary of the Lao Patriotic Front Party, Minister of Information, Propaganda, and Tourism of the Lao National United Government, and member of the National Implementation Committee for the 1962 Geneva Agreement on Laos, Fumi Vongvichit. At the same time, he received the attached statement by the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front Party on the fourth anniversary of the signing of the 1962 Geneva Agreement on Laos.

	In his letter, he said: "Due to the U.S. imperialists' mad expansion of the war of aggression in Laos, blatantly sabotaging the 1962 Geneva Agreement, and severely infringing upon Laos' sovereignty and independence, the situation in Laos is extremely dangerous. Therefore, I respectfully request your attention to the current extremely dangerous situation in Laos."

	In his letter, Fumi Vongvichit, on behalf of the Lao Patriotic Front Party, requested that the Chinese government take effective measures to support the suggestions put forward in the Lao Patriotic Front Party's statement on July 23.

	The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front Party, in its statement on July 23, strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists' systematic sabotage of the 1962 Geneva Agreement on Laos and their attempt to turn Laos into a base for aggressive war. The statement resolutely demands that the U.S. government stop its war of aggression in Laos, withdraw all U.S. military personnel, weapons, ammunition, and military supplies, as well as the military personnel and troops of U.S. lackeys from Laos, and allow the Lao people to solve their own problems. It also demands an immediate halt to all bombing of the liberated areas.

    陈毅副总理函复老挝爱国战线党总书记冯维希
    中国人民永远是老挝人民的坚强后盾
    谴责美帝彻底撕毁了关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议
    新华社二十日讯　中国国务院副总理兼外交部长陈毅，二十日写信给老挝爱国战线党总书记、老挝民族团结政府新闻、宣传和游览大臣、一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议全国实施委员会委员富米·冯维希，答复他七月二十三日的来信，重申中国人民全力支持老挝人民的抗美救国正义斗争，直到最后胜利。
    复信全文如下：阁下：
    我收到了阁下一九六六年七月二十三日的来信和随信附来的老挝爱国战线党中央委员会关于老挝问题的一九六二年日内瓦协议签订四周年发表的声明。
    老挝爱国战线党中央委员会的声明，严正谴责了美帝国主义一贯破坏关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，扩大侵略和干涉老挝，并且阴谋把侵略越南和老挝的战火扩大到整个印度支那的滔天罪行；表示了老挝人民决心粉碎美帝国主义侵略阴谋的坚强意志。中国政府和人民完全支持老挝爱国战线党中央委员会在声明中所阐明的严正立场。
    美帝国主义是老挝人民和印度支那各国人民不共戴天的敌人。美帝国主义发动了对越南人民的全面的侵略战争，最近又轰炸了越南民主共和国的首都河内，从而最后地、彻底地撕毁了一九五四年日内瓦协议。在老挝，美帝国主义早已颠覆了民族团结政府，发动了对老挝人民的侵略战争。美国强盗飞机对老挝解放区进行了狂轰滥炸，美国及其仆从泰国和南越的军事人员大量地进入了老挝，美帝国主义还积极准备派遣地面部队直接对老挝进行侵略。美帝国主义在老挝的所作所为，彻底地破坏了一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议。事实一再证明，美帝国主义是从来不把任何国际协议放在眼里的。正如毛泽东主席所指出的，一纸协议决不会使美帝国主义放下屠刀、立地成佛，或者变得稍为规矩些。
    在美帝国主义侵略面前，老挝人民进行了英勇顽强的斗争，给予了美帝国主义以沉重的打击，取得了重大的胜利。美帝国主义是外强中干的，一切革命的人民只要不相信帝国主义的“好话”，不害怕帝国主义的恐吓，敢于同它进行针锋相对斗争，就一定能够取得最后胜利。
    中老两国人民唇齿相依。在老挝人民反对美帝国主义的斗争中，中国人民永远是老挝人民的可靠的、坚强的后盾。中国人民全力支持老挝人民的抗美救国正义斗争，直到取得最后胜利。
    顺致最崇高的敬意。
                      中华人民共和国国务院副总理兼外交部长
                                            陈毅
                       一九六六年八月二十日于北京
    新华社二十日讯　中华人民共和国国务院副总理兼外交部长陈毅收到了老挝爱国战线党总书记、老挝民族团结政府新闻、宣传和游览大臣、一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议全国实施委员会委员富米·冯维希七月二十三日的来信，同时收到了来信中所附的老挝爱国战线党中央委员会发表的关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议签订四周年的声明。
    他在来信中说：“由于美帝国主义疯狂地进行扩大侵略老挝战争的行动，明目张胆地破坏一九六二年日内瓦协议，严重侵犯老挝的主权和独立，从而严重地威胁着印度支那半岛和东南亚的安全，因此我谨提请你注意老挝目前极其危险的局势。”
    富米·冯维希在来信中以老挝爱国战线党的名义，要求中国政府采取有效措施，支持老挝爱国战线党在七月二十三日的声明中所提出的建议。
    老挝爱国战线党中央委员会在七月二十三日的声明中强烈谴责美帝国主义有计划地破坏了一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，并且企图把老挝变成侵略战争的策源地。声明坚决要求美国政府停止对老挝的侵略战争，从老挝撤走美国的一切军事人员、武器、弹药和军用物资以及美国的仆从的军事人员和军队，让老挝人民自己来解决自己的问题，并且立即停止对解放区的一切轰炸。
