	Every Word and Sentence Shines

	In Inner Mongolia, from new industrial cities to vast grasslands, from the Greater Khingan Range to the Ejina Desert, people of all ethnic groups cheered in various languages upon hearing the broadcast of the Communist Party's Eighth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

	In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, from new industrial cities to vast grasslands, from the Greater Khingan Range to the Ejina Desert, the Mongol, Han, Hui, Manchu, Daur, Evenki, and Oroqen peoples, upon hearing the broadcast of the Communist Party's Eighth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, expressed their profound love, admiration, and reverence for Chairman Mao in various languages: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" The people of all ethnic groups unanimously agreed that the communiqué is a great blueprint for building our country into a powerful socialist state. Every word and sentence shines with the brilliance of great Mao Zedong Thought. We, the working people, must strictly follow every word and sentence, and must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end and to carry the socialist revolution through to the end.

	In the new industrial cities of Baotou and Chifeng, people of all ethnic groups, including workers, peasants, and urban residents, held rallies and parades in the rain the same day they heard the communiqué. On the 14th, over 70,000 people in Baotou gathered at the municipal committee to report the good news.

	In the city of Hailar in the Hulunbuir League, on the 14th, 28,000 people from various ethnic groups and sectors held a grand rally and parade to express their strongest support for the communiqué. In the Aladagtu Brigade of Aladagtu Commune in Zhalaitai Banner at the foot of the Greater Khingan Range, the party branch secretary, Mojigece, said: The plenary session communiqué allowed us to hear the voice of the great leader Chairman Mao once again. The poor and lower-middle peasants of the Aladagtu Brigade will forever remember Chairman Mao's teachings, never forget class struggle, and pass on the invincible great Mao Zedong Thought from generation to generation, ensuring that the proletariat's leadership is forever in the hands of the working people.
