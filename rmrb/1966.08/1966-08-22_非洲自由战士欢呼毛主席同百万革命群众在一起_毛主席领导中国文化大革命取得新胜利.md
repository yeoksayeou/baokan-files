African freedom fighters here have hailed Chairman Mao Tse-tung, the great leader of the Chinese people, for joining a mass rally of a million revolutionary people in Peking in his military uniform to celebrate the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The New China News Agency reported from Dar es Salaam on August 21 that African freedom fighters here expressed their warm congratulations on the new victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao.

The chief representative of the Swaziland People's Liberation Movement stationed here, Zwani, said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China will certainly eliminate the possibility of the restoration of the capitalist system in China. This great revolution is being carried out under the guidance of Mao Tse-tung Thought. It is a revolution of international significance. Its victory is not only the victory of the Chinese people but also our victory.

Zwani, who has visited China three times, said, "Mao Tse-tung Thought has long been deeply rooted in the hearts of the Chinese people." The continuous victories of the Chinese people are the results of the correct leadership of Chairman Mao Tse-tung.

David Sibeko, the chief representative of the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania stationed here, enthusiastically said, "We, the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania, pay tribute to the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Tse-tung, who are correctly leading the heroic Chinese people, and congratulate you on the victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." He went on to say, "The revolutionary people of the world must remain vigilant, because even within the revolutionary ranks, there are people who only talk about struggle in words." He said: "These people are wolves in sheep's clothing. They are the usurpers of the hard-won fruits of the people." At the end of his speech, he excitedly shouted, "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China!"

Kanzu, the representative of the South West Africa People's Organization stationed here, after carefully reading the communiqué of the 11th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, repeatedly said, "This is a very important document."

He said, "Chairman Mao's thought is our guide. It has established the correct line and the correct path for us to follow. It will lead us to victory." He said, as pointed out in the part on the international situation in the communiqué, the counter-revolutionary activities of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in various countries are promoting the revolutionary activities of the people in various countries.

He stressed, "After suffering some setbacks due to the machinations of imperialism, the revolutionary people will organize themselves better and fight imperialism more powerfully."

He also said that the revisionists are trying to bribe and buy off some members participating in the liberation movement to sabotage the liberation struggle of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. He stressed, "It is very important to fight against revisionism."

    非洲自由战士欢呼毛主席同百万革命群众在一起
    毛主席领导中国文化大革命取得新胜利
    新华社达累斯萨拉姆二十一日电　这里的非洲自由战士听到中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东主席，穿着军装同北京百万革命群众一起参加庆祝无产阶级文化大革命的盛大集会的消息后，纷纷向新华社记者发表谈话，热烈欢呼由毛主席亲自领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命取得的新胜利。
    斯威士兰人民民族解放大会驻这里的首席代表兹瓦尼说，中国无产阶级文化大革命，必将根除资本主义制度在中国复辟的可能性。这场大革命，是在毛泽东思想指导下进行的。这是带有国际意义的大革命，它的胜利，不仅是中国人民的胜利，也是我们的胜利。
    曾经三次访问过中国的兹瓦尼说，“毛泽东思想在中国早已深入人心。”中国人民连年取得的胜利，“是毛泽东主席正确思想带来的成果。”
    阿扎尼亚泛非主义者大会驻这里的首席代表戴维·西贝科热情地说，我们阿扎尼亚泛非主义者大会向正确领导着英雄的中国人民的中国共产党和毛泽东主席致敬，祝贺你们在无产阶级文化大革命中所取得的胜利。他接着说：“世界革命人民必须保持警惕，因为甚至在革命队伍内部，也存在着这样一些人，他们仅仅在口头上谈论斗争。”他说：这些人“是披着羊皮的狼。他们是人民得来不易的胜利果实的篡夺者”。他在谈话结束时兴奋地高呼：“中国无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”
    西南非洲民族联盟驻这里的代表坎祖在认真地阅读了中国共产党八届十一中全会的公报后，一再地表示：“这是非常重要的文件”。
    他说：“毛主席的思想是我们的指南。它为我们确立了应该遵循的正确方针和正确道路。它将引导我们走向胜利。”他说，正如公报在关于国际形势部分中所指出的，美帝国主义及其在各国的走狗所进行的反人民反革命的活动，正在促进各国人民的革命活动。
    他强调指出：“革命人民由于帝国主义的阴谋而遭受一些挫折后，将把自己更好地组织起来，同帝国主义作更有力的斗争。”
    他还说，修正主义者在竭力贿赂和收买参加解放运动的一些成员，以便破坏亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的解放斗争。他强调说：“同修正主义作斗争是十分重要的。”
