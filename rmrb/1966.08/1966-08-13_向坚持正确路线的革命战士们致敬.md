Representatives from fourteen countries and regions who withdrew from the 12th World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs are visiting China in a friendly capacity. They have raised the banners of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism, defended the correct line and glorious traditions of the anti-nuclear movement, and opposed factionalism and sabotage, conducting principled struggles. The Chinese people salute these revolutionary fighters and express warm welcome to them.

At this year's World Conference, certain leaders of the Japanese Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs (Gensuikyo) and the Japanese delegation attempted to openly align with Soviet revisionists and impose an erroneous line on others. Despite the resolute opposition and patient advice of the vast majority of foreign delegations, they insisted on forcing representatives of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, which is engaged in factional and sabotage activities, into the conference. This extremely erroneous action, of course, aroused dissatisfaction and indignation among the representatives of various countries.

The collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union to monopolize nuclear weapons and engage in nuclear blackmail is a well-known fact. After the signing of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty by three countries, the U.S. and the Soviet Union are now plotting the so-called "Non-Proliferation Treaty" scam. Not long ago, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko went to Tokyo and made dirty deals with the Sato government on this issue. Under the manipulation of certain leaders of the Japanese Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and the Japanese delegation, this year's World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs did not condemn the betrayal by the Soviet revisionist leadership, did not expose the new conspiracies of U.S.-Soviet collusion, but instead advocated "united action" with Soviet revisionists, which inevitably led the conference astray.

The sixteen delegations from countries and regions that withdrew from this year's World Conference issued a statement in Tokyo pointing out that the so-called "united action" slogan proposed by the conference organizers is completely wrong. It "blurred the line between enemies and friends" and "intended to open the door to the enemy (including their disguised agents trying to infiltrate our ranks)." Well said, well said. How can all revolutionary people, all those who genuinely oppose U.S. imperialism and love peace, join forces with the Soviet revisionist leadership, the accomplices of U.S. imperialism, and engage in "united action" with them?

Reactionaries are often the best negative teachers for revolutionary people to judge right from wrong. Now they are giving us another "lesson." Listen, Japanese Prime Minister Sato Eisaku shouted on August 6 that he hoped the anti-nuclear movement would proceed in a non-partisan manner. Originally, under the support of the Soviet revisionist leadership, a small group of right-wing members of the Japanese Socialist Party split from the Japanese Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and are now also shouting about the "emergence of a unified atmosphere." Whose interests does this so-called "united action" serve? Isn't it clear?

The Japanese people are a glorious vanguard in the struggle against U.S. imperialism. The combat friendship and great unity between the peoples of China and Japan in the struggle against our common enemy, U.S. imperialism, is unbreakable by anyone. The Chinese people will, as always, firmly support the Japanese people's anti-U.S. struggle. We believe that no matter what twists and turns or obstacles appear on our shared path forward, the peoples of China and Japan will forever stand together in the cause of opposing U.S. imperialism and defending peace in Asia and the world.

　　向坚持正确路线的革命战士们致敬
　　本报评论员
    退出第十二届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的十四个国家和地区代表，来我国友好访问。他们高举反帝反修旗帜、为维护禁止原氢弹运动的正确路线和光荣传统、反对分裂和破坏，进行了原则性的斗争。中国人民向这些革命战士们致敬，并表示热烈欢迎。
    在本届世界大会上，日本“禁原氢协”和日本代表团的某些领导人，企图公开同苏联修正主义者挂钩，把一条错误的路线强加于人。他们不顾绝大多数外国代表团的坚决反对和耐心劝告，硬要把进行分裂破坏活动的世界民主青年联盟的代表塞进大会。这种极端错误的行动，当然会引起各国代表们不满和愤慨。
    美苏勾结搞核垄断，核讹诈，是举世皆知的事实。在三国部分停止核试验条约签订之后，美苏又在策划所谓“防止核扩散条约”的大骗局。前不久，苏联外长葛罗米柯去东京，就同佐藤政府在这个问题上大做肮脏的交易。本届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会，在日本“禁原氢协”和日本代表团的某些领导人的操纵下，不谴责苏修领导集团的背叛，不揭露美苏勾结的新阴谋，反而鼓吹要同苏联修正主义者搞“统一行动”，这就必然要把大会引入歧途。
    退出本届世界大会的十六个国家和地区代表团在东京发表声明指出，大会主持者提出的所谓“统一行动”的口号是完全错误的，它“模糊了敌友之间的界线”，“是打算向敌人（包括试图钻进我们的队伍的它的伪装的代理人）敞开大门”。说得对，说得好。一切革命人民，一切要反对美帝国主义、真正爱好和平的人们，怎么能够同美帝国主义的帮凶苏修领导集团结成一伙，同他们搞什么“统一行动”呢？
    反动派常常是革命人民判断是非的最好的反面教员。现在他们又来给我们“上课”了。请听，日本首相佐藤荣作八月六日叫嚷，希望“禁止原氢弹运动超党派地进行”。原来在苏修领导集团支持下，从日本“禁原氢协”分裂出去的一小撮日本社会党右派分子，现在也在叫嚷什么“出现了统一的气氛”。所谓“统一行动”，究竟符合谁的利益，难道还不清楚吗？
    日本人民是反对美帝国主义斗争的一支光荣的突击队。中日两国人民在反对美帝国主义这个共同敌人的斗争中结成的战斗友谊和伟大团结，是任何人也破坏不了的。中国人民将一如既往，坚决支持日本人民的反美斗争。我们相信，不管在我们共同前进的道路上出现什么样的曲折和障碍，中日两国人民为了反对美帝国主义、保卫亚洲和世界和平的事业，将永远站在一起。
