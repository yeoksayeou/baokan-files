Only by consciously participating in collective production labor can one gain rich leadership experience and play a demonstrative, bridging, and leading role.

The cadres of the Party and government organs in Chongqing, in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, have been steadfastly implementing the system of cadres participating in physical labor. Especially since 1964, apart from some comrades going to factories to implement the "three fixes and one replacement" shift labor, some units have set up small factories to participate in industrial production labor, those who remain in the office spend one to two days a week participating in the labor of the office experimental farm, planting cotton and cultivating mulberry trees, and conducting scientific experiments to develop new economic crop varieties in the Chongqing region.

In the past, some bourgeois "experts" had claimed that the Chongqing region, with its rainy springs and summers and severe droughts in the summer, could not grow cotton. We were determined to refute their fallacies. But at that time, we did not know the technology of growing cotton. What should we do? We studied Chairman Mao's works with questions in mind. Chairman Mao said: "No matter who wants to understand some matter, they must come into contact with that matter, that is, live (practice) in the environment of that matter, otherwise it is impossible to solve the problem." Chairman Mao's instructions greatly encouraged us. We analyzed various contradictions, combined revolutionary enthusiasm with a scientific attitude, humbly learned from the experience of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee's cadres in growing cotton experimental fields, and practiced diligently to solve one contradiction after another. Not only did we grow cotton, but we also achieved a relatively high yield, completely refuting the fallacy that Chongqing cannot grow cotton, and creating initial experience for opening up new cotton areas in Chongqing. Now, the cotton fields in the Chongqing region have developed to more than 8,000 mu. Comrades have received profound education in dialectical materialism and the theory of knowledge from labor practice.

We participate in collective production labor according to Chairman Mao's instructions, strengthen the labor viewpoint, transform our thinking, and promote the laborization of intellectual cadres. Our relationship with the masses has also become closer. Everyone deeply feels that only by consciously participating in collective production labor can one gain rich leadership experience, go to the production front line to lead production, and have a common language with the people, take root and blossom among the people, and play a demonstrative, bridging, and leading role. Once separated from labor, one will be separated from the working people and may fall into revisionism. Now, many comrades go deep into the grassroots, go to factories and villages, and wherever they go, they labor as ordinary laborers, participate in production, and lead production. This has played a certain role in promoting the development of economic crops in the Chongqing region and promoting large-scale increases in agricultural production throughout the city.

Recently, Chairman Mao issued the great instruction to turn various industries into revolutionary schools that are both industrial and agricultural, both cultural and military. This puts forward higher requirements for us Party and government organ workers. We will definitely resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions, further improve the system of participating in physical labor, and at the same time learn military affairs, politics, and culture, participate in the struggle to criticize bourgeois culture, and truly turn the organs into schools of Mao Zedong Thought.

　　是干部又是普通劳动者
    只有自觉地参加集体生产劳动，才能取得丰富的领导经验，发挥示范、桥梁和带头作用。
    中共重庆市委员会机关通讯组
    重庆市党政机关干部，根据党中央和毛主席的指示，坚持执行干部参加体力劳动的制度。特别是一九六四年以来，除部分同志到工厂实行“三定一顶”顶班劳动，有的单位自办小型工厂，参加工业生产劳动外，留在机关的同志每周以一至二天的时间参加种机关试验田的劳动，种植棉花，培育桑树，为在重庆地区发展经济作物新品种大搞科学实验。
    过去，有些资产阶级“专家”，曾断言重庆地区春夏多雨、伏旱严重，不能种棉花。我们决心粉碎他们的谰言。但当时大家不懂得种棉花的技术，怎么办呢？我们带着问题学习毛主席著作，毛主席说：“无论何人要认识什么事物，除了同那个事物接触，即生活于（实践于）那个事物的环境中，是没有法子解决的。”毛主席的指示大大鼓舞了我们。我们分析了各种矛盾，把革命干劲和科学态度结合起来，虚心学习四川省委机关干部种棉花试验田的经验，扎扎实实地实践，认真解决一个又一个矛盾，不但种出了棉花，而且得到较高的产量，彻底驳倒了重庆地区不能种棉花的谬论，为在重庆开辟新棉区创造了初步经验。现在重庆地区的棉田已发展到八千多亩。同志们从劳动实践中，受到了深刻的辩证唯物论的认识论的教育。
    我们按照毛主席的指示，参加集体生产劳动，增强了劳动观点，改造了思想，促进了知识分子干部劳动化，同群众的关系也更密切了。大家深深感到，只有自觉地参加集体生产劳动，才能取得丰富的领导经验，到生产第一线去领导生产，才能和人民群众有共同语言，在人民群众中生根开花，起到示范、桥梁和带头作用。脱离了劳动，就会脱离劳动人民，就有可能出修正主义。现在，许多同志深入基层，下厂下乡，都是走到哪里，就以普通劳动者的身份在哪里劳动，参加生产，领导生产。这对于促进重庆地区经济作物的发展，对于促进全市农业大面积增产都起到了一定作用。
    最近，毛主席发出了把各行各业办成亦工亦农、亦文亦武的革命化大学校的伟大指示，对我们党政机关工作人员提出了更高的要求。我们一定最坚决地贯彻执行毛主席的英明指示，进一步搞好参加体力劳动的制度，同时也要学军事，学政治，学文化，参加批判资产阶级的文化革命斗争，把机关真正办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
