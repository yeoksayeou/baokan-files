Today, many cities held rallies and parades simultaneously with the capital. Under the loudspeakers on the city streets, in the squares of factories and schools, and in front of the reception stations of provincial, municipal, and autonomous region party committees, people began to gather from the moment the capital's rally was broadcast. People listened to the speeches of Comrade Lin Biao, Comrade Zhou Enlai, and the representatives of revolutionary teachers and students, together with the million revolutionary masses of the capital, accepted the review of the great leader Chairman Mao, and shouted slogans together. People's hearts beat in unison with the million revolutionary masses of the capital. The cheers of the people in various places gathered into the loudest and most powerful voice:

They went to the Communist Party of China Shanghai Municipal Committee to express their determination to follow Chairman Mao from a young age to make revolution in the great winds and waves. Many people held newly purchased copies of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and participated in the celebratory parade with hearts full of happiness.
