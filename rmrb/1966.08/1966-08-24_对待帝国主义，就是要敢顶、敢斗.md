To face imperialism, we must dare to confront and fight. Chairman Mao said in 1957, as he crossed the Yangtze River, "The Yangtze River, others say it is very big, but big is not to be feared. The U.S. imperialists are big, aren't they? We confronted them and it was nothing." Chairman Mao's great directive teaches us: when facing seemingly powerful enemies, when facing imperialism and all reactionaries, we must confront them, fight them, struggle against them, and dare to smash them. If we do not dare to confront them, thinking that "you can't touch a tiger's ass," they will be iron tigers, live tigers, roaring and ready to devour people; if we dare to struggle, dare to confront, dare to fight, they will become paper tigers, dead tigers, tofu tigers.

Daring to struggle, daring to confront, daring to fight, is the condition to expose the true nature of paper tigers. The practice of the world's revolutionary people in their struggles against all reactionaries over the past twenty years has proven this. Our personal experience in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army fighting in Korea has also completely proven this. Back then, U.S. imperialism had advanced to the Yalu River, boasting and acting arrogantly. They never expected that the newly established People's Republic of China would dare to send troops to confront them. The Chinese and Korean people confronted them, and in an instant, they were beaten bloody, exposing their paper tiger facade, and they had to retreat across the 38th parallel with their tails between their legs.

The entire Korean War was like this, and so was every specific battle. As long as we are not afraid of them, dare to struggle, dare to confront, dare to fight, the paper tiger will reveal its true nature. In the spring of 1953, our company defended a crucial frontline position on the eastern front of our army—a small unnamed hill. This position was like a dagger in the enemy's throat, a nail in the enemy's eye, and the enemy hated it to the core, launching crazy attacks. Once, the enemy mobilized hundreds of cannons, more than ten planes, sixteen tanks, and the strength of three infantry battalions, launching thirty-two consecutive attacks. On a hill less than one square kilometer in size, they poured in more than ten thousand shells. It seemed fierce and formidable, like an iron tiger, a live tiger. However, these reactionary beasts, once they faced us, saw our shining bayonets charging at them, and immediately fled in terror, revealing their paper tiger nature. Although our comrades defending the position were few in number and had poor equipment, we were revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We were not afraid of death, not afraid of hardship, fearless, and stood firm, holding out, defending for six days and six nights, annihilating more than 1,400 of the enemy. The red flag always flew over the small unnamed hill.

During the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's fighting in Korea, the Chinese and Korean people fought side by side, exposing the U.S. imperialists' paper tiger nature, and set an example for the people of the world, greatly inspiring the fighting spirit and confidence of the world's revolutionary people. Now, anti-American storms are raging all over the world, and everywhere people are confronting and exposing paper tigers. Especially in South Vietnam, U.S. imperialism is being beaten black and blue by the heroic Vietnamese people. The facts speak loudly: "All the people of the world must have courage, dare to fight, not be afraid of difficulties, and go forward bravely. Then, the whole world will surely belong to the people. All devils will be destroyed."

    对待帝国主义，就是要敢顶、敢斗
    前志愿军二级战斗英雄　宋祥华
    毛主席在一九五七年横渡长江的时候说：“长江，别人都说很大，其实，大，并不可怕。美帝国主义不是很大吗？我们顶了他一下，也没有啥。”毛主席这一伟大指示教导我们：对待貌似强大的敌人，对待帝国主义和一切反动派，就是要顶，要斗，要拚，要敢于把它砸烂。不敢顶，认为“老虎屁股摸不得”，它就是铁老虎，活老虎，张牙舞爪地要吃人；敢拚，敢顶，敢斗，它就变成了纸老虎，死老虎，豆腐老虎。
    敢拚，敢顶，敢斗，是迫使纸老虎原形毕露的条件。二十年来，世界革命人民和一切反动派的斗争实践证明了这一点，我们中国人民志愿军入朝作战中的亲身体会，也完全证明了这一点。想当年，美帝国主义曾经打到鸭绿江边，耀武扬威，不可一世。它万万没有想到：刚刚成立的中华人民共和国，就敢出兵同它顶。中朝人民和它顶了，就一下把它顶得头破血流，戳穿了它纸老虎的画皮，它只好夹着尾巴逃过三八线。
    整个朝鲜战争是如此，每一次具体战斗也是如此。只要我们不怕它，敢拚，敢顶，敢斗，纸老虎就要现原形。一九五三年春天，我们连坚守东线我军前沿一个突出的重要阵地——小无名高地。这个阵地好比插在敌人咽喉上的尖刀，钉在敌人眼睛里的铁钉，敌人恨之入骨，不断疯狂地进攻。有一次敌人出动了几百门火炮，十多架飞机，十六辆坦克，以及三个步兵营的兵力，连续发动三十二次进攻。在方圆不到一平方公里的山头上，倾泻了十多万发炮弹。看起来，气势汹汹，好不威武，似乎是一只铁老虎、活老虎。但是，这些武装到牙齿的反动野兽，一旦和我们照面，看到我们端着闪闪发光的刺刀冲到眼前，便立刻魂飞天外，现出纸老虎的原形，一个个吓得没命地奔逃。我们坚守阵地的同志虽然人数不多，武器装备差，但是我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，我们不怕死，不怕苦，无所畏惧，硬是站得稳，顶得住，坚守了六天六夜，消灭了敌人一千四百多名。红旗一直飘扬在小无名高地上。
    中国人民志愿军入朝作战中，中朝人民并肩战斗，戳穿了美帝国主义纸老虎，给全世界人民顶出了个样子，大大鼓舞了世界革命人民的斗志和信心。现在，世界各地到处都掀起了反美风暴，到处都在顶纸老虎，戳纸老虎。尤其在南越，美帝国主义被英雄的越南人民打得焦头烂额、狼狈不堪。事实雄辩地证明：“全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
