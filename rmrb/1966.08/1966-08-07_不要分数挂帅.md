Title: Do Not Let Scores Take Command

From our personal experiences, we deeply feel that the old examination system is one where scores take command, not where proletarian politics take command. It opens the door wide for the bourgeoisie to cultivate successors.

When we were in middle school, schools, in order to pursue the "admission rate" one-sidedly, made improving students' "examination scores" the starting point and foundation of all work. Some schools put forward the wrong slogan of "reducing the burden on graduates and squeezing out all time for reviewing lessons." Some even canceled political and youth league activities for the graduating class, exempted graduates from holding school-level social positions, and even class-level work was all handled by the class advisor. They even criticized students for enthusiastically responding to Chairman Mao's call to "learn from Comrade Lei Feng," doing good deeds, and labeled it as "not studying hard" and "not focusing on the main task," using it to suppress students' political enthusiasm. "Scores" overrode everything, and improving the "admission rate" became the sole goal.

These bourgeois "authorities," in order to pursue the "admission rate" one-sidedly, used every means to "mobilize" students' enthusiasm for reviewing lessons. They organized students to visit university campuses and laboratories, introduced which university cultivates what "engineers" and which university cultivates what "experts," and invited "experts" and "scholars" to give speeches, sharing their experiences of becoming famous and successful. This fostered the bourgeois ideology of individual struggle and the white specialist road among the youth.

Chairman Mao taught us that we should cultivate the youth to become "socialist-conscious, cultured laborers." But some middle schools, in order to improve "examination scores," canceled the graduating class's participation in summer harvests, drought relief, and other labor activities. The classrooms, dormitories, and public hygiene areas of the graduating class had to be cleaned by lower-grade students. Some schools even had lower-grade students wash the clothes and bring meals for the graduates. How can this cultivate "socialist-conscious, cultured laborers"? It can only cultivate a privileged class detached from the workers and peasants. This examination system that lets scores take command must be smashed!

    不要分数挂帅
    群教
    从我们亲身体验中，深深感到旧的考试制度实行的是分数挂帅，不是无产阶级政治挂帅，是为资产阶级培养接班人大开方便之门。
    我们在中学时，学校为了片面追求“升学率”，提高学生的“考试成绩”就成了全盘工作的出发点和基础。有的学校提出了“减轻毕业生负担，挤出一切时间复习功课”的错误口号。有的竟取消了毕业班的党团活动，免除毕业生担任校一级的社会工作，就连班上的一些工作也统统由班主任包干。甚至把同学们热烈响应毛主席“向雷锋同志学习”的伟大号召，做好人好事，也指责为“不用功”、“不务正业”，用来打击学生的政治积极性。“分数”压倒一切，提高“升学率”成了唯一的奋斗目标。
    这些资产阶级的“权威”，为了片面追求“升学率”，就千方百计“调动”学生复习功课的积极性，组织学生参观什么大学的校舍啦，实验室啦，介绍这所大学培养的是什么“工程师”啦，那所大学又培养的是什么“专家”啦，并且请“专家”“学者”作报告，现身说法，介绍他们成名成家之道。这就助长了青年个人奋斗、走白专道路的资产阶级思想。
    毛主席教导我们，应该把青年培养“成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”，但有些中学为了提高“考试成绩”，就取消了毕业班参加夏收、抗旱等劳动，毕业班的教室、宿舍、公共卫生区都要派低年级的同学帮助打扫。有的学校，甚至毕业生的衣服也是低年级同学洗，吃饭也是低年级的同学端。这怎么能够培养出“有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”呢？它只能培养出那种脱离工农群众的特权阶层。这种实行分数挂帅的考试制度必须砸碎！
