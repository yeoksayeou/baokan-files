In the past, when our platoon did work among the masses, we only helped the community members with farm work and household chores, without paying attention to raising their ideological awareness. Often, once we left, the work also "left." Chairman Mao said: The army's tasks are not just about fighting; it also needs to shoulder the responsibilities of propagating to the masses, organizing the masses, and arming the masses. After discussion, we realized: arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought is the most fundamental and important task we should undertake.

Chairman Mao called for the entire nation to become a revolutionary school. Our army, in doing work among the masses, must grasp the task of using Mao Zedong Thought to educate and transform people. This is the most resolute and thorough implementation of Chairman Mao's great directive.

Last May, our platoon went to a mountain village for field training. We found that some cadres and community members had insufficient understanding of the class struggle in rural areas. Some young people did not even know how landlords in the old society oppressed and exploited farmers. How could we help them understand and enhance their class struggle awareness? We focused on understanding the village's painful history before liberation, learning about the painful family histories of some old poor farmers, and collecting some very educational materials. We selected four comrades who could write and draw to create ninety illustrations and also collected some physical items to set up a "Village History Exhibition." Community members all rushed to visit. A nearly seventy-year-old poor farmer, Chen Grandma, also brought her granddaughter, about ten years old, to see. As she looked, she pointed to the illustrations of her family's suffering and said to her granddaughter: "This is how our family suffered before liberation. Today, Chairman Mao has let us live a good life. We must not forget the past!"

Class education works wonders. After seeing the exhibition, the poor and lower-middle peasants strengthened their class and class struggle awareness. Militia squad leader Chen Jingzhong used to think that the reactionaries' and exploiting classes' guns had been confiscated, and their power had been seized by us, so what could they do? Therefore, he never had the enthusiasm to train. After visiting the village history exhibition, he recalled his past suffering from exploitation, saw today's enemies' tricks, and thought about how three-quarters of the world's people are still suffering. He felt that his past thoughts were too dangerous. He said: "As long as there are class enemies in the world, neither the guns in our minds nor the guns in our hands can be relaxed."

To fundamentally enhance the masses' class struggle awareness, we immediately organized and helped the masses study Chairman Mao's works. The platoon's cadres and soldiers voluntarily contributed money to buy over 250 copies of Chairman Mao's individual works, which were donated to the production team. We also helped them establish study groups for Chairman Mao's works.

Mao Zedong Thought not only made the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dai Village understand the importance of never forgetting the past sufferings and always holding onto the gun, but also made them recognize that the main tactic of the current class enemies attacking us is "peaceful evolution." Therefore, when they discovered a bad element using the tactic of telling reactionary stories to lure and corrupt the youth, they fought back against the enemy. When the enemy told reactionary stories, they performed revolutionary modern plays, cultivated two red storytellers, sang revolutionary songs, made a three-scene slide show, and set up three rooms to arrange a "cultural room." They vigorously propagated Mao Zedong Thought, making proletarian ideology occupy the ideological and cultural front in the village.

Through working among the masses, we deeply understood: the people need a thousand things and ten thousand things, but what they need most is the great Mao Zedong Thought. The soldiers had a deep realization: "It was only through this practice that we truly learned how to do work among the masses."

    用毛泽东思想武装群众是最根本最重要的工作
    解放军某部指导员  赵芝亮
    以往我们连做群众工作，只是帮助社员做农活和家务劳动，不注意提高群众的思想觉悟，往往是人走了，工作也“走”了。毛主席说的：军队的任务不单纯是打仗，还要担负宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众的任务。经过讨论，大家才认识到：用毛泽东思想武装群众的头脑，这才是我们要做的最根本最重要的群众工作。
    毛主席号召全国都应该成为革命化的大学校，我们军队做群众工作，要抓住用毛泽东思想教育人改造人这个最根本最重要的工作，才算最坚决最彻底的执行了毛主席这个伟大的指示。
    去年五月，我们连到山区代村野营。我们发现有的干部和社员对农村的阶级斗争形势认识不足，有的小青年对旧社会地主怎样压迫和剥削农民也不知道。如何帮助他们认识和提高阶级斗争观念呢？我们就注意了解这个村解放前的痛苦历史，了解一些老贫农的痛苦家史，搜集了一些很有教育意义的材料。我们抽出四个能写会画的同志绘制成九十张图画，并且搜集了一部分实物，开办了一个“村史展览”，社员们都赶来参观。年近七十岁的贫农社员陈老大娘，也领着十来岁的孙女来看，她一边看，一边指着图画上画的她家受苦的情景对孙女说：“这就是解放前咱家受的罪，今天毛主席让咱过上了好日子，咱可不能忘记过去啊！”
    阶级教育一抓就灵。贫下中农看了展览以后，增强了阶级和阶级斗争观念。民兵排长陈敬忠，过去认为反动派和剥削阶级的枪杆子被缴械了，印把子被我们夺过来了，他们还敢怎么样？因此练武总是鼓不起劲头来。参观了村史展览以后，他回忆起自己过去受的剥削苦，看看今天阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，想想全世界还有三分之二的人在受罪，感到自己过去的想法太危险了。他说：“只要世界上还有阶级敌人，咱们思想里的枪和手中的枪都不能放松。”
    为了从根本上提高群众的阶级斗争观念，我们紧接着就组织和帮助群众学习毛主席著作。连里干部、战士自动凑钱买了二百五十多本毛主席著作单行本，赠送给生产队。并且帮助他们成立学习毛主席著作小组。
    毛泽东思想不仅使代村大队的贫下中农懂得了永远不忘过去苦，永远掌握枪杆子，也使他们认清了当前阶级敌人向我们进攻的主要手段是“和平演变”。所以当他们发觉一个坏分子利用讲反动小说的手段拉拢腐蚀青年，他们就和敌人针锋相对地作斗争。敌人讲反动故事，他们就大演自编的革命现代戏，培养了两名红色故事员，大唱革命歌曲，自制了三个镜头的幻灯，并腾出了三间房子布置了“文化室”，大力宣传毛泽东思想，使无产阶级思想占领了这个村的思想文化阵地。
    通过做群众工作，使我们深刻地懂得了：人民群众千需要万需要，最需要的是伟大的毛泽东思想。战士们深有体会地说：“我们从这次实践中，才真正学会了做群众工作。”
