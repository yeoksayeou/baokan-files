	Heartily Cheering the Establishment of the Cultural Revolution Committee

	At a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is deeply developing, the Party Central Committee has made a wise decision. In the decision, the Party Central Committee also instructed to establish a Cultural Revolution Committee. We, all comrades, heartily cheer for this decision of the Party Central Committee. We are determined, under the leadership of the Party, to push the Cultural Revolution to a new high tide.

	To welcome this high tide, we must further launch a mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, placing the study of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all work, and using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything. With Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, we will criticize bourgeois ideology, criticize old culture, old customs, and old habits, and overthrow all ghosts and monsters. All of us workers are also determined to strive to fulfill the national plan, and with practical actions, carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

　　热烈欢呼成立文化革命委员会
    在无产阶级文化大革命运动深入开展的时候，党中央作出了英明的决定。在决定中，党中央还指示要成立文化革命委员会。我们全体同志热烈欢呼党中央的这项决定。我们决心在党的领导下，将文化大革命运动推向一个新的高潮。
    为了迎接这一高潮，我们要进一步掀起群众性活学活用毛主席著作的运动，把毛主席著作的学习放在一切工作的首位，以毛泽东思想统帅一切。以毛泽东思想为武器，批判资产阶级思想，批判旧文化，旧习惯，旧风俗，打倒一切牛鬼蛇神。我们全体职工还下定决心，要努力完成国家计划，用实际行动将文化大革命进行到底。
