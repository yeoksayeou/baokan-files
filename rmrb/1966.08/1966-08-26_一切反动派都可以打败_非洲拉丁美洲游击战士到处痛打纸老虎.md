According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Cairo on August 24, a news release from the Revolutionary Committee of Mozambique, stationed in Cairo, said that from May 2 to August 3 this year, the Mozambican guerrillas were very active. In the Zombo, Zombwe, and Fingwe regions of Tete Province, they annihilated 75 Portuguese invaders. On June 21, seven miles away from the Mongue outpost, the guerrillas shot down a Portuguese colonial army helicopter, killing the pilot and six invading soldiers on board.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on August 25, the Congolese (Brazzaville) newspaper *Combat* recently published a dispatch describing an encounter between Angolan guerrillas and Portuguese troops on the Beliz public road. The guerrillas set out from their base, with a reconnaissance team leading the way to clear Portuguese mines. Behind them were 35 guerrillas carrying light and heavy machine guns, rocket launchers, ammunition, and food. The next day, the guerrillas reached the ambush site, only three kilometers away from the Portuguese military outpost.

A few hours later, two elite paratrooper units of the Portuguese arrived. When they entered the semicircular ambush set by the main guerrilla force, the guerrilla commander gave the order to fire. Anti-tank rockets hit the engine of the truck, and before the Portuguese paratroopers could figure out who was shooting at them, they were hit one by one. After three minutes of fighting, the guerrillas successfully withdrew.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on August 25, from Bogota: On August 19, Colombian anti-government guerrillas completely annihilated a platoon of the Colombian government army in the Alto Patos region of the Uila Province, under the jurisdiction of the city of Tello. This was the guerrillas' most fierce attack in recent years and a heavy blow to the newly established Yeras government.

The battle involved 100 well-armed guerrillas who launched a surprise attack on the government troops.

On July 28, near the city of Bucaramanga, the capital of Santander Province, a guerrilla unit suddenly attacked a patrol of the government army's Fifth Brigade in the Marta district, killing a captain and four soldiers and wounding several others. This patrol had been sent to this area to hunt down guerrillas because the guerrillas had killed the local police chief two days earlier. However, they soon entered the guerrilla ambush area. According to reports, the guerrillas also seized many weapons in this battle.

    一切反动派都可以打败
    非洲拉丁美洲游击战士到处痛打纸老虎
    据新华社开罗二十四日电　据莫三鼻给革命委员会驻这里办事处最近发表的新闻公报说，今年五月二日到八月三日期间，莫三鼻给游击战士十分活跃，在太特县的宗博、宗布韦和芬格韦地区，歼灭葡萄牙侵略者七十五名。六月二十一日，在离蒙格哨所七英里的地方，游击战士击落一架葡萄牙殖民军的直升飞机，飞机上的驾驶员和侵略军六名全部丧命。
    据新华社二十五日讯　刚果（布）《战斗报》最近发表一篇通讯，描写了一次安哥拉游击战士袭击在贝利兹公路上的葡萄牙军队的运输车的战斗经过：游击队从基地出发，侦察小组走在前面，负责清除葡萄牙军队埋设的地雷。后面是三十五名游击队员，背着轻重机枪、火箭筒、弹药和食品。第二天，游击队到达伏击地点，这里距葡萄牙军队的据点只有三公里。
    几个小时以后，先后来了两支葡萄牙伞兵的精锐部队。当它进入游击队主力构成的半包围圈时，游击队的指挥员发出了射击命令，反坦克火箭炮击中了卡车的马达，葡萄牙伞兵还来不及弄清楚谁在射击他们，就纷纷被击中。经过三分钟的战斗，游击队员就胜利撤退。
    据新华社二十五日讯　波哥大消息：哥伦比亚反政府游击队八月十九日在乌伊拉省阿尔托帕托地区的特略市管辖区全部歼灭哥伦比亚政府军一个排。这是游击队在近几年中发动的最猛烈的一次进攻，同时是对上台不久的耶拉斯政府的一次沉重打击。
    参加战斗的有一百名武器精良的游击战士，他们对政府军发动了奇袭。
    七月二十八日，在距离桑坦德省省会布卡拉曼加市不远的马尔塔区，一支游击队突然袭击了政府军第五旅的一支巡逻队，打死一名上尉和四名士兵，打伤另外一些政府军。这支巡逻队是前往这个地区搜捕游击队员的，因为游击队员在两天前打死了当地警察局的一名巡长。但是他们出动不久，就进入了游击队的伏击区。据报道，游击队在这次战斗中还缴获了许多武器。
