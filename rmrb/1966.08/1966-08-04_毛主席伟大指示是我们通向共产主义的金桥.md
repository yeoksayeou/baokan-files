Chairman Mao's great directive is our golden bridge to communism. The people of the entire nation resolutely support the transformation of every industry into a revolutionary school that is both industrial and agricultural, both cultural and military.

Senior leaders of the People's Liberation Army at the division and corps levels are actively going to the companies to thoroughly and accurately explain Chairman Mao's directives.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on August 3, our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao's call to transform every industry into a revolutionary school that is both industrial and agricultural, both cultural and military, has quickly spread throughout the nation. In every corner and every industry of the nation, it has sparked enthusiastic cheers. People say that Chairman Mao's words are the most effective, the most powerful. Chairman Mao's directive is our golden bridge to communism. We resolutely support it and will definitely carry it out. Many people have shared their personal experiences, stating that in the past, whenever we followed Chairman Mao's great thoughts, we achieved success on the path of revolutionization. Since last November, the Jinan Meat Processing Joint Venture has cooperated with surrounding production teams to implement a labor system that is both industrial and agricultural, which has been warmly welcomed by the production teams and ensured the smooth completion of industrial production tasks. With Chairman Mao's great call, the workers have expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's directive and transform the factory into a revolutionary school that is both industrial and agricultural, both cultural and military. Old worker Zhang Fuyin from the Lard Workshop said: "Each small group in our workshop has community members participating in production. These community members actively study Chairman Mao's works and complete their tasks excellently. Some community members, after working for half a year, have surpassed old workers who have been working for more than a decade. We must follow Chairman Mao's directive and gradually narrow the gap between workers and peasants." Zhu Dian Commune's Zhu Dian Production Brigade's model community member Ye Sixi said: "The dozens of people from our brigade who came to work in the factory have all learned some skills. We also participate in the factory's militia training, cultural and entertainment activities, and propaganda work. During the Cultural Revolution, we took up our pens to write big-character posters and attack the ghosts and monsters. After participating in the factory's work, we have strengthened our organizational discipline, rapidly improved politically, and become new-type peasants. This is all because Chairman Mao has shown us a bright path. We must follow this bright path and step by step advance towards communism."

In recent years, the Nanning Automobile Terminal has focused on industry while also learning some military, political, and cultural knowledge. They have held three sessions of Chairman Mao's works study classes, established night schools for cultural education, and conducted militia training in conjunction with actual combat requirements. During the Cultural Revolution, they have also thoroughly criticized the authority of the bourgeoisie. Upon receiving Chairman Mao's directive, the party, administrative, and trade union leaders of this station immediately studied how to more consciously build the workforce into a new type of communist who can wield a hammer to work, a hoe to farm, a gun to fight, and a pen to write, with a high level of political awareness and comprehensive development.

Jiang Rongji, the party branch secretary of the Hunchun Paper Mill in Tonghua, Jilin Province, said that reviewing the path our factory has taken makes us feel even more that Chairman Mao's words have unparalleled power. In the past, our factory was a small factory with only one broken machine, completely relying on commodity pulp to make paper. Since organizing the entire factory's staff to study Chairman Mao's works and firmly grasp the class struggle as the key, the spiritual outlook of the broad masses of workers has undergone a profound change, achieving one victory after another in the three great revolutionary movements, transforming the broken-down factory into a nationally advanced enterprise in the paper industry that can produce export paper. He said: "In a thousand ways and ten thousand ways, we must definitely put the study and application of Chairman Mao's works as the top priority in all our work. We must definitely respond to Chairman Mao's great call and resolutely become critics of the old world, builders and defenders of the new world."

Peasants from poor and lower-middle peasant households across the country enthusiastically welcomed Chairman Mao's great directive, which pointed out the path of revolutionization for them. Rao Xingli, a representative of the National People's Congress, a national model agricultural worker, and vice-chairman of the Hubei Province Poor and Lower-Middle Peasant Association, said: "We poor and lower-middle peasants must take Chairman Mao's great call as our compass and guiding light, transforming the poor peasant association into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. To run this great school well, we must focus on agriculture (including forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries), also learn military affairs, politics, and culture, and when conditions permit, also establish some small factories collectively, and criticize the bourgeoisie. This is the path of revolutionization for us poor and lower-middle peasants. To run this great school well, we must first place the study and application of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of the poor peasant association's work. Second, the work of the poor peasant association must emphasize politics, with Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, insisting on class struggle and the struggle between the two lines as the key, constantly criticizing the bourgeoisie, transforming the worldview of small producers, breaking private interests and establishing public interests, breaking old things and establishing new things, making the poor and lower-middle peasants into a highly proletarianized and highly combat-ready class force. We must also learn military affairs. Since 1958, our entire province's rural areas have established militia regiments, and many communes and production brigades have done a good job in militia work, combining production with military training, able to farm and fight, implementing universal military service. We must summarize experiences and further improve this. We must also establish small factories, combining industry and agriculture. Our poor peasant association organizations must assist collectives in running small factories well, gradually narrowing the gap between workers and peasants, between urban and rural areas, and at the same time, we must learn culture, carry out literacy campaigns, conduct scientific experiments, and gradually narrow the gap between manual and mental labor."

Zhao Xianzhen, the party committee secretary of Shapu Commune in Qinzhou County, Guangxi, said when talking about Chairman Mao's directive that in recent years, our commune has also established some small factories. During the farming off-season, farmers go to the factories to work as workers, which can gradually narrow the gap between workers and peasants. Our commune has also established semi-agricultural, semi-study schools. Poor and lower-middle peasants have culture and can engage in scientific research, write articles, criticize all ghosts and monsters, and participate in the Cultural Revolution. In this way, people's spiritual outlook and production outlook have undergone tremendous changes. All of this is the result of emphasizing politics and studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

The broad masses of community members in Taiping Village Brigade of October Commune in Nanjing, which Chairman Mao inspected ten years ago, felt particularly intimate and happy upon hearing Chairman Mao's latest directive, as if Chairman Mao had come to Taiping Village Brigade again. Ten years ago, Chairman Mao instructed the farmers here to strive to learn culture.

Today, the vast majority of school-age children in this brigade have already gone to school, and the farmers who were once illiterate have had 80% of them remove their illiteracy caps. Brigade women's director Yu Fuzhen said excitedly: "Our poor farmers have been without culture for generations. Only the Communist Party and Chairman Mao care for us and want to make us into new farmers who can both labor and have culture, gradually eliminating the difference between manual and mental labor. I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's latest directive and continue to study hard, and study better than before."

Revolutionary teachers and students across the country believe that Chairman Mao's directive is to break the old education system and establish a new education system, making our schools better at cultivating millions of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. Wu Qing'an, a teacher at Shenyang Labor University, said: "Our school has carried forward the revolutionary spirit of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, walking the path of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University. Teachers and students teach, learn, and labor together, building brick kilns, houses, farming, and raising silkworms on their own, strengthening the feelings of the working people. In the past two years, what we have learned is better than reading for sixteen years. We must definitely follow Chairman Mao's directive, implement the half-work (agriculture) and half-study education system, and cultivate new communists with high political awareness and comprehensive development using Mao Zedong Thought."

Li Guoping, a teacher in the Mathematics Department of Wuhan University, said: "Chairman Mao's directive to shorten the school system and revolutionize education means that we cannot allow bourgeois intellectuals to continue to dominate our schools. We revolutionary teachers and students of the Mathematics Department of Wuhan University have felt from long-term struggle practice that education must be carried out in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought. In recent years, our Mathematics Department of Wuhan University has carried out a great revolution in education according to Mao Zedong Thought and achieved brilliant results. Under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, we must thoroughly reform the bourgeois education system, destroy the old world, and build a limitlessly bright and beautiful new world of communism."

Chairman Mao's great call reached the Tibetan Plateau, and people's revolutionary spirit soared. Tibetan workers and emancipated peasants expressed their determination to definitely follow Chairman Mao's directive and become new communists. Workers of the Lhasa Cement Factory immediately held a meeting. In recent years, the Tibetan and Han workers of this factory have started from scratch, building the factory and producing while training troops, farming, and learning culture. They have established more than thirty study groups of Chairman Mao's works, with all factory workers participating in the study. During the Cultural Revolution, all factory workers took up their pens to criticize the bourgeoisie. Tuoleng Ni Ma, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works and a model Tibetan worker, said excitedly: "Chairman Mao is the red sun of our emancipated serfs. I love to listen to Chairman Mao's words. I will definitely take the lead in following Chairman Mao's directive and transform the factory into a revolutionary school!" Ciren Dunzhu, the party branch secretary of Dongga Township, a former slave, said: "We firmly support Chairman Mao's brilliant directive. Just knowing how to farm is not enough to be a new communist peasant. A communist peasant should be a revolutionary with high political awareness and comprehensive development. Since the democratic reform, the more than a thousand emancipated peasants of Dongga Township have been learning politics and culture under the leadership of the Party. This spring, they also established a militia organization and began learning military affairs, launching a socialist education movement. The political awareness of the masses is constantly improving, and revolutionary spirit is surging. Chairman Mao's new and extremely great directive has made our direction clearer."

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on August 3, many senior leaders of the People's Liberation Army at the division and corps levels have recently actively gone to the companies, airfields, docks, high-altitude outposts, border islands, and other dispersed small teams to thoroughly and accurately explain Chairman Mao's directive that the People's Liberation Army should be a great school to the broad masses of soldiers and officers. They have also organized discussions in conjunction with the actual situation of the troops, allowing everyone to deeply understand the great significance of Chairman Mao's extremely important directive, broaden their horizons, expand their minds, and collectively strive to truly transform our army into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Since the enlarged meeting of the Military Commission in 1960, the party committees and political organs at all levels of the army have always regarded the transmission and implementation of the directives of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao as their primary task. As soon as Chairman Mao's new great directive was issued, the party organizations of all troops immediately took action, seriously studying, seriously researching, and seriously understanding it, and then dispatching a large number of leading cadres to the grassroots units to explain the directive. Recently, more than a hundred division and corps leaders have been sent to companies and remote areas by the Chengdu troops. These cadres live and eat with the soldiers in the companies, thoroughly and accurately explain Chairman Mao's directive to the soldiers, and seriously discuss with the soldiers. In recent days, dozens of division-level cadres who have been stationed in the companies of the Beijing troops have made explaining Chairman Mao's directive their primary task, learning and explaining as they go, grasping living thoughts, and organizing discussions.

Senior leaders going to the grassroots units to explain Chairman Mao's directive has greatly inspired the broad masses of soldiers. Many soldiers excitedly said: "The leaders personally come to explain Chairman Mao's directive with historical significance, which is great!" "The leaders explain it clearly and thoroughly, speaking to our hearts!" After the division commander Ding Ruqin explained in the Howitzer Second Company, he introduced the situation of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army acting as combat teams, work teams, and production teams in the enemy's rear during the Anti-Japanese War, explaining that military learning, military agriculture, military industry, and military-civilian integration are Chairman Mao's consistent thoughts, the glorious tradition of the people's army, and the magic weapon to defeat the enemy. The soldiers listened more and more eagerly, and during the discussion, they talked more and more excitedly, their thoughts became more and more open, and they felt more and more the greatness of Chairman Mao. The soldiers expressed their determination to respond to Chairman Mao's great call with practical actions, striving forward in the great school of Mao Zedong Thought, tempering themselves, and becoming new communists.

    毛主席伟大指示是我们通向共产主义的金桥
    全国人民坚决拥护把各行各业办成亦工亦农亦文亦武革命化大学校
    解放军师团以上领导干部纷纷深入连队原原本本地宣讲毛主席指示
    据新华社三日讯　我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席关于把各行各业都办成亦工亦农、亦文亦武的革命化大学校的伟大号召，已经迅速传遍全国，在全国每一个角落、每一个行业，都引起了热烈的欢呼。人们说，毛主席的话最灵，毛主席的话最有威力，毛主席的这个指示，就是我们通向共产主义的金桥，我们坚决拥护，坚决执行。许多人还以自己的切身经历谈到，过去凡是按照毛主席的这个伟大思想去做的，就在革命化的道路上取得了成就。济南肉类联合加工厂从去年十一月以来，就和周围的生产大队协作，实行亦工亦农的劳动制度，受到了生产大队的热烈欢迎，同时保证了工业生产任务的顺利完成。这次毛主席的伟大号召传来，工人们表示一定要遵照毛主席的指示，把工厂办成亦工亦农、亦文亦武的革命化大学校。肉脂车间老工人张福印说：“我们车间各个小组都有公社社员参加生产，这些社员积极学习毛主席著作，完成任务很出色，有的社员工作半年，劳动效率就超过了干了十几年的老工人。我们一定要按照毛主席的指示，逐步缩小工农差别。”正在这个厂做工的祝甸公社祝甸大队五好社员叶锡芝说：“我们大队来厂作工的几十个人都学会了一些技术。我们还参加工厂的民兵练武，参加文化娱乐活动和宣传工作，在文化大革命中，我们又拿起笔写大字报，向牛鬼蛇神开火。我们参加工厂工作后，加强了组织性纪律性，政治上提高很快，成了新型的农民，这都是因为毛主席给我们指出了一条光明大道，我们一定要沿着这条光明大道，一步一步走向共产主义。”
    南宁汽车总站，近年来，以工为主，兼学了一些军事、政治和文化，办了三期毛主席著作学习班，办了文化夜校，并结合实战要求搞民兵训练，在文化大革命中，他们又大破对资产阶级“权威”的迷信。毛主席的指示传来，这个站的党、行政和工会的负责人，立即结合本站的具体情况，研究如何更加自觉地把职工队伍建设成为拿起锤子就能做工，拿起锄头就能种田，拿起枪杆子就能打敌人，拿起笔杆子就能写文章，具有高度政治觉悟的、全面发展的共产主义新人。
    吉林省浑江市临江造纸厂党支部书记姜荣吉说，回顾我们工厂走过的道路，越发使我们感到毛主席的话具有无比的威力。过去我们厂是一个只有一台破烂机器、完全靠商品浆造纸的小厂。自从组织全厂职工大学毛主席著作，牢牢抓住阶级斗争这个纲以后，广大职工的精神面貌发生了深刻变化，在三大革命运动中取得了一个又一个胜利，把破烂厂办成了能生产出口纸张的全国造纸行业的先进企业。他说：千条万条，我们一定要把活学活用毛主席著作列为一切工作的头一条。我们一定响应毛主席的伟大号召，坚决做旧世界的批判者，新世界的建设者和保卫者。
    各地的贫农下中农社员热烈欢呼毛主席的伟大指示给他们指出了革命化的道路。全国人民代表大会代表、全国农业劳动模范、湖北省贫农下中农协会副主席饶兴礼说：我们贫农下中农一定要把毛主席这个伟大号召，作为我们的方向盘、指南针，把贫协组织办成毛泽东思想的大学校。要办好这个大学校，就是要以农为主（包括林、牧、副、渔），也要兼学军事、政治、文化，在有条件的时候，也要由集体办些小工厂，也要批判资产阶级。这是我们贫农下中农的革命化的道路。要办好这个大学校，首先要把活学活用毛主席著作放在贫协工作的首位，其次，贫协工作要突出政治，用毛泽东思想挂帅，坚持以阶级斗争与两条道路斗争为纲，经常批判资产阶级，改造小生产者的世界观，破私立公，破旧立新，使贫农下中农成为非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的阶级队伍。我们还要学军事。一九五八年以来，我们全省农村大办了民兵师，许多公社、生产大队的民兵工作都搞得很好，既生产，又练武，能种田，能打仗，实行全民皆兵。我们要总结经验，进一步办好。我们也要办小型工厂，亦工亦农。我们贫协组织要协助集体办好小型工厂，逐步缩小工农差别、城乡差别，同时，我们要学文化，搞好扫盲工作，搞科学试验，逐步缩小体力劳动与脑力劳动的差别。
    广西钦州县沙埔公社党委书记赵显祯在谈到毛主席的指示时说，几年来，我们公社也兼办了一些小工厂，农民在农闲时进厂当工人，这就可以逐步地缩小工农之间的差别。我们公社还办了半农半读学校，贫农下中农有了文化，就能够搞科学研究，能写文章，批判一切牛鬼蛇神，参加文化大革命。这样，人的精神面貌和生产面貌都发生了巨大的变化。所有这些，都是突出政治、活学活用毛主席著作的结果。
    毛主席曾在十年前视察过的南京市十月公社太平村大队的广大社员，听到毛主席的最新指示后，仿佛觉得毛主席又来到了太平村大队，格外感到亲切、高兴。十年前毛主席曾指示这里的农民要努力学习文化。
    今天，这个大队的适龄儿童绝大多数都已上学，当年一字不识的农民已有百分之八十摘掉了文盲帽子。大队妇女主任余福珍激动地说：“我们贫苦农民祖祖辈辈没有文化，只有共产党毛主席才关怀我们，要使我们成为既能劳动又有文化的新农民，逐步消灭体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别。我一定要按照毛主席的最新指示，继续努力学习，要比以前学得更好。”
    各地学校的革命师生认为，毛主席的指示，就是要打破旧的教育制度，建立新的教育制度，让我们的学校更好地培养出千百万无产阶级革命事业的接班人。沈阳劳动大学教师吴庆安说：我们学校发扬了抗大的革命精神，走抗大的道路，师生边教、边学、边劳动，自己动手修砖窑，盖房子，种地，养蚕，增强了劳动人民的思想感情。两年来学到的东西胜读十六年书。我们要坚决遵照毛主席的指示，贯彻半工（农）半读的教育制度，用毛泽东思想培养出有高度政治觉悟的、全面发展的共产主义新人。
    武汉大学数学系教师李国平说：毛主席指示学制要缩短，教育要革命，决不能让资产阶级知识分子继续统治我们的学校。我们武汉大学数学系革命师生从长期斗争的实践中体会到，办教育必须坚决按照毛泽东思想来办。几年来，我们武大数学系就是按照毛泽东思想进行了一场教育上的大革命，获得了光辉成果。我们在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下，一定要彻底改革资产阶级的教育制度，摧毁旧世界，建设一个无限光明无限美好的共产主义新世界。
    毛主席的伟大号召，传到西藏高原后，人们革命精神大振，藏族工人和翻身农民纷纷表示要坚决按照毛主席的这一指示去做，做共产主义新人。拉萨水泥厂的工人马上举行了座谈会。几年来，这个厂的藏、汉族工人自己动手，白手起家，边建厂、边生产，又练兵、又种地、又学文化，先后成立了三十多个毛主席著作学习小组，全厂职工都参加了学习，在文化大革命运动中，全厂职工拿起笔杆，批判资产阶级。学习毛主席著作积极分子、藏族五好工人土登尼玛激动地说：“毛主席是我们翻身农奴的红太阳，毛主席的话我最爱听，我一定要带头按毛主席的指示去做，把工厂办成革命化的大学校！”拉萨郊区东嘎乡奴隶出身的党支部书记次仁顿珠说：“我们坚决拥护毛主席的这一英明指示。光会种田算不上是共产主义的新农民，共产主义的农民应该是具有高度政治觉悟和全面发展的革命者。我们东嘎乡一千多名翻身农民从民主改革以来，就在党的领导下，不断学习政治、文化，今年春天又建立了民兵组织，开始学习军事，并开展了社会主义教育运动，群众的政治觉悟不断提高，革命精神蓬勃高涨。毛主席这一新的极其伟大的指示使我们方向更明确了。”
    据新华社三日讯　中国人民解放军许多师团以上领导干部，最近纷纷深入连队、机场、码头，深入高原哨所、边防海岛和其它分散执勤的小分队，向广大指战员原原本本地宣讲毛主席关于人民解放军应该是一个大学校的指示，并且联系部队实际认真组织座谈讨论，让大家深刻领会毛主席这一极为重要指示的伟大意义，打开眼界，开扩胸怀，群策群力地把我军真正办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    解放军的各级党委和政治机关从一九六○年军委扩大会议以来，一直把传达和贯彻党中央、毛主席的指示，当作首要任务。毛主席新的伟大指示一经下达，各部队党组织就闻风而动，立即认真学习，认真研究，认真领会，然后派出大批领导干部带着毛主席的指示到基层单位宣讲。成都部队最近派到连队和边远地区分散部队去的师团领导干部就有一百多名。这些干部在连队里和战士们同吃、同住，原原本本地向战士宣讲毛主席的指示，十分认真地同战士一起座谈讨论。北京部队某师在连队蹲点的数十名团以上干部，最近几天把宣讲毛主席的指示作为首要任务，边学边讲，边抓活思想，边组织讨论。
    师团以上干部到基层单位宣讲毛主席指示，给广大指战员以极大鼓舞。许多战士激动地说：“首长们亲自来讲毛主席这一具有历史意义的伟大指示，太好了！”“首长们讲得清，谈得透，讲到我们心坎上了！”某师师长丁汝勤在榴炮二连宣讲以后，用自己的经历，介绍了抗日战争时期，八路军、新四军在敌后执行战斗队、工作队和生产队的情况，说明军学、军农、军工、军民是毛主席一贯的思想，是人民军队的光荣传统，是战胜敌人的法宝。战士们越听越爱听，讨论时越谈越兴奋，越谈思想越开阔，越感到毛主席的英明伟大。战士们纷纷表示，要以实际行动响应毛主席的伟大号召，在毛泽东思想的大学校里，奋发向前，加紧锻炼，使自己成为共产主义的新人。
