The Chinese people are not afraid of U.S. war provocations!

The U.S. nuclear submarine "Guardfish" brazenly entered Hong Kong's inner waters with the connivance of the British authorities in Hong Kong, and our side is closely monitoring the situation.

New China News Agency, Beijing, August 10th: Just as U.S. imperialism is madly bombing Hanoi and Haiphong, escalating the Vietnam War to a new stage, the U.S. Navy's nuclear submarine "Guardfish" entered Hong Kong's inner waters on the 8th, once again blatantly provoking the Chinese people with naked aggression. People here are closely monitoring the situation.

The "Guardfish" is the third U.S. nuclear-powered warship to enter Hong Kong waters this year. In late January, the U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier "Enterprise" and the nuclear-powered cruiser "Long Beach" entered Hong Kong, which at the time aroused great anger and strong protests from Hong Kong residents.

With the connivance of the British authorities in Hong Kong, U.S. warships have been using Hong Kong as a base for expanding their aggressive war. Many U.S. warships that have participated in the massacre of the Vietnamese people have come to Hong Kong this year. By 5 PM on the 9th, in addition to the "Guardfish," there were eleven other U.S. warships gathered in Hong Kong waters, including the amphibious assault ship "Princeton."

　　中国人民不怕美国战争挑衅！
　　美核潜艇在香港英当局纵容下悍然驶进香港，我方正密切注视
    新华社北京十日讯  正当美帝国主义疯狂轰炸河内、海防，把侵越战争“升级”到一个新阶段的时候，美国海军的核潜艇“军曹鱼号”又于八日驶进香港内海，再一次公然向中国人民进行赤裸裸的战争挑衅。此间人士对此正密切注视中。
      “军曹鱼号”是今年以来开进香港海面的第三艘美国核动力军舰。今年一月底美国核动力航空母舰“企业号”和核动力巡洋舰“班布里奇号”曾驶进香港，当时激起了香港居民的极大愤怒和强烈抗议。
    在香港英国当局的纵容下，美国军舰一直在利用香港作为它扩大侵略战争的活动基地。参加屠杀越南人民的许多美国军舰今年都到过香港。到九日下午五时止，除“军曹鱼号”外，麕集在香港海面的美国军舰还有十一艘，其中包括两栖攻击舰“普林斯顿号”。
