	After taking over, we continued to maintain stable operations. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Under certain conditions, bad things can lead to good results, and good things can also lead to bad results." During the shift, due to poor coordination with the second station, the temperature of the second reactor fluctuated when adjusting the vent valves from container 301 to 207. Although this does not seem like a good thing, our shift learned from this lesson, strengthened communication with the second station, and adjusted the vent valves from container 301 to 207 twice. The temperature did not change.

	Chairman Mao teaches us that humanity must constantly summarize experiences, make discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress. We are not only good at destroying an old world, but we will also be good at building a new world. Today, operator Chen Yuting and shift leader Liu Yanbo proactively blocked the vent of container 313, preventing container 305 from overflowing with ether water. This method is the most important way to reduce solvent consumption. At the same time, they demonstrated a spirit of daring to think and dare to venture. In the past, water washing used two pumps in series, but now it uses only one, with excellent results.

	The production conditions were chaotic when we took over. Facing these problems, we firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "People want to achieve victory in their work, that is, to achieve the expected results, they must make their thoughts conform to the laws of the objective external world. If they do not conform, they will fail in practice." Therefore, we first conducted investigations and analyses. According to Chairman Mao's teachings, we strategically despised these difficulties but paid attention to each specific action. As a result, we started operation at 10:05 and ran smoothly, ensuring that the product quality met the standards.

    ·掌握生产规律·
    一九六六年四月二十五日
    值班人　张雨林　谭乃树
    接班后继续保持平稳操作。毛主席教导我们：“在一定的条件下，坏的东西可以引出好的结果，好的东西也可以引出坏的结果。”上班由于和二号岗位配合不够，在调节容三○一至容二○七放空阀时，造成二号反应器温度波动。看起来这不是好事，本班吸取了这一教训，加强了和二号岗位的联系，曾两次调节容三○一至容二○七的放空阀，温度并没变化。
    一九六六年五月二十八日
    值班人　刘延波　翟稳
    毛主席教导我们，人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。今天，操作工陈云亭和班长刘延波，主动把三一三号容器放空加死堵，使容三○五不溢流醚水，这种做法是降低溶剂消耗最重要的一条。同时，他们还发扬了敢想、敢闯的精神。过去水洗水用两台泵进行串级，现在改用一台，效果很好。
    一九六六年七月三日
    值班人　沈运启　张庆民
    接班时生产条件较乱。面对这些问题，我们牢牢记住了毛主席的教导：“人们要想得到工作的胜利即得到预想的结果，一定要使自己的思想合于客观外界的规律性，如果不合，就会在实践中失败。”因此，我们首先进行了调查研究，观察分析。按毛主席的教导，在战略上藐视这些困难，而在具体的每一个动作上重视它。结果，十点零五分投入运转，运行良好，并保证了产品质量合格。
