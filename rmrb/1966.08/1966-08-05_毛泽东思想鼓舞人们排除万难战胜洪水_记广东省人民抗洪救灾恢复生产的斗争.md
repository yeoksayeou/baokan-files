Since June and until the beginning of July, Guangdong Province experienced continuous, widespread, and prolonged rainfall. Most areas received over 500 millimeters of rain, with some areas receiving over 1,200 millimeters. The Dongjiang, Xijiang, Beijiang, Zengjiang, and Tanjiang rivers all experienced unprecedented high water levels simultaneously, compounded by tidal surges, resulting in nearly a month of continuous flood threats. This was an extremely rare occurrence in history.

The people of Guangdong, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, displayed a fearless revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win. They built thousands of miles of levees, holding back the floods and minimizing their destructive impact. As a result, this year's early rice yield was slightly higher than last year's.

Revolutionized People Are the "Thousand-Mile Golden Dikes"

During the flood-fighting struggle, every levee in the province became a classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. On the levees and in the tents, "Quotations from Chairman Mao" boards were everywhere. Mao Zedong Thought gave the flood-fighting army immense inspiration. From June 10 to 24, over a half-month period, the Huicheng District of the Dongjiang Basin experienced two consecutive flood peaks. Over 400,000 flood-fighting soldiers stood their ground, fought continuously, and ensured the safety of most major levees along the shore. In Qingyuan County, downstream of the Beijiang River, there is a levee called Qingxi Levee that protects 150,000 mu of farmland. When it was hit by a massive flood, the levee collapsed seven times and was in imminent danger of breaching. Over 5,000 people fought tirelessly for three to four days and nights, ultimately saving the levee. They said, "In the past, people would have been scared away; now, with Mao Zedong Thought in our minds, we fear neither heaven nor earth, and we have held back the floods."

The most critical flood-fighting area in the middle reaches of the Dongjiang River is the Shanzhou Levee in Dongguan County, which is a sandbar prone to flooding. In the past, due to its low and thin levees, it often collapsed during floods. However, this time, despite the massive flood hitting it for four days and nights, the Shanzhou Levee remained intact. At the most critical moment, everyone remembered Chairman Mao's teaching: "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." People encouraged each other, "Persistence is victory." When the levee was in danger, poor peasant Huang Fa dived into the water to plug the levee's holes, working underwater for five hours. Where did this spirit come from? Huang Fa answered well: "I remembered Chairman Mao's words about serving the people completely and thoroughly. To protect the lives and property of thousands of people in Shanzhou Levee, who would consider personal danger?"

Strategically, we must despise the enemy, but tactically, we must take the enemy seriously. The flood-fighting army, following Chairman Mao's brilliant thought, fully utilized their subjective initiative and objective favorable conditions. Often, in critical moments, they turned disadvantages into advantages and passivity into initiative. After repelling the first flood peak of the Beijiang River, the people of Qingyuan County adopted the mindset of preparing for the worst and striving for the best. Many production brigades' workers ate, lived, and studied on the levees, standing by in full readiness. Those working at home to harvest crops were also prepared with sandbags and stone bags, ready to support rescue efforts at any time. Later, although the Beijiang River surged with three more flood peaks, due to their control over the initiative and advantages, they timely discovered and plugged thousands of potential danger points. All levees in the county remained safe. Summarizing the victory of the flood-fighting struggle, the people of Qingyuan County said, "People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the iron wall and copper wall of the flood-fighting struggle!"

The People's Interests Are Above All Else

During this flood-fighting struggle, the People's Liberation Army and cadres at all levels displayed a revolutionary spirit of fearing neither hardship nor death. Wherever there was danger, they fought there. When the thousand-mile levees in the middle and lower reaches of the Dongjiang River were in full alert, soldiers from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army rushed to the collapsed levee section, immediately jumped into the water, and used their bodies to form a human levee, resisting the raging floodwaters. This allowed workers to quickly repair the collapsing levee, saving the lives of 80,000 people in Huizhou City. These fearless and brave people always remembered: protecting the people's interests is their sacred duty. A soldier said, "The flood is the enemy, and the levee is our battlefield. For the people, as long as there are people here, the flood will not find a gap in our defense."

During the most intense days of flood-fighting, the Huicheng District Party Committee and county committee leaders all went to the front lines. They appeared before the people at the most difficult times. When the Dongguan County Party Committee Secretary, Yao Wenshu, learned that the bridgehead commune's Tonghu anti-flood culvert was leaking, threatening the 400,000 mu of rice fields in the entire county, he rushed to the scene at night and personally led over 300 people to rescue the situation, timely plugging the culvert. At that time, it was already around 4:30 AM, but he did not rest and instead rushed to the most intense flood-fighting area at Guayingzhou Levee.

On June 22, a mountain flood erupted in Duozhu Commune, Huidong County. The commune Party Committee Secretary led a group of comrades to sail to the lowest-lying area of Weide Brigade's Pinggang Village to rescue people. When boarding the ship, the masses repeatedly stopped them, saying, "The ship cannot reach Pinggang Village and will sink." They firmly said, "Chairman Mao teaches us to correctly handle the issue of life and death. We cannot stand by and watch over a thousand class brothers in Pinggang Village suffer, even if it means risking our lives." They resolutely sailed into the rapids, reaching Pinggang Village, and rescuing the people waiting for help on the roofs and floors to the large ship. At that time, there was also a seriously ill old person trapped in a house about to collapse. Because the houses on both sides had already collapsed, the ship could not enter the alley, so the deputy secretary, Qiu Tuan, took the lead to jump off the ship and, together with other comrades, carried the old person onto the ship.

The Spirit of Norman Bethune Shines Brightly

In the middle and lower reaches of the Dongjiang River, one often hears cadres and commune members saying similar phrases: "We must learn from Norman Bethune." "All revolutionary comrades must care for, love, and help each other." Chairman Mao's teachings became the highest directive for the local people's flood-fighting struggle. The commune members of Zengguang Brigade in the heavily affected area of Duozhu Commune in Huidong County risked their lives to rescue a nearly lifeless ox from the floodwaters. They thought of the upstream commune members who lacked oxen and would have difficulty resuming production, so they fed it with concentrated feed and sent it back after finding the owner. Where did this deep class sentiment come from? A poor peasant commune member said well, "Because we read Chairman Mao's books, our hearts are filled with the word 'revolution,' and we have fewer selfish thoughts and more thoughts for the people and the revolution." Isn't this a good reflection that the old worldview that has poisoned people for thousands of years is changing, and the worldview of the proletarian revolution is taking root in the hearts of millions of peasants!

On June 22, the Dongjiang River's floodwaters surged, mountain floods rushed down, and converged in the large drainage canal of Tieshang Commune in Boluo County, unable to flow out. The downstream levee section was only a few centimeters away from being overtopped, and many levee sections had already collapsed. Over 11,000 mu of ripe early rice and the homes of 2,000 people were on the verge of being swallowed by the floodwaters. At this critical moment, the Chixi Brigade held an emergency meeting and decided to open the Shimenlou water gate of the brigade, diverting the floodwaters into their own 700 mu of rice fields, ultimately saving the early rice fields and homes of over 10,000 people in other brigades downstream.

"The Flood Cannot Take Away Our Hands"

Due to the unusually fierce flood, in some areas where mountain floods erupted, areas where internal waterlogging could not be drained in time, and areas where levees were low, some damage was still sustained.

Even when the water was still surrounding them, the Party and the state sent planes to air-drop grain to support the disaster areas. As soon as the water receded, trucks loaded with grain, farming tools, daily necessities, and seeds were sent from all directions to the disaster areas. The poor and lower-middle peasants in the disaster areas said gratefully, "This is the kindness of the Party and Chairman Mao." However, they decided to engage in production self-rescue and did not want to accept too much support from the state and class brothers from other places.

During the recovery of production, Longjin Brigade in Shuikou Commune, Huicheng County, lacked seeds, but the commune members proposed the slogan, "Difficulties do not leave the brigade, difficulties do not leave the village." Many people donated the seeds they had saved at home to the brigade. Xinnan Commune in Huidong County is a heavily affected commune. When discussing how to resume production, the commune members said, "Those who beg will not eat for long; those who work will never lack." They did not want relief supplies or loans and decided to rely on their own hands to resume production. Shangliao Brigade in Pingtan Commune, Huicheng County, is a low-lying area where the flood caused severe losses. The commune members studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, demonstrating tenacious willpower. They proposed the loudest slogan, "Even in a disaster year, we will strive for a bumper harvest." After the floodwaters receded, they seized the time, and for every field they reclaimed, they planted one.

At that time, in the disaster areas where the water had not yet completely receded and some rice fields still had standing water, everywhere was a bustling scene of production. The commune members did not wait and observe but put all the work of resuming production on their own strength, full of confidence and high morale.

The people of Guangdong defeated this massive flood and, at the same time, reviewed the great achievements of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works over the past year. People more clearly understood this truth: people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are invincible.

    毛泽东思想鼓舞人们排除万难战胜洪水
    ——记广东省人民抗洪救灾恢复生产的斗争
    六月以来到七月初，广东省连续大范围、长时间降雨。多数地区降雨五百毫米以上，局部地区多达一千二百多毫米。东江、西江、北江、增河、潭江等河流，同时接连出现了超过历史上最高洪水位的特大洪峰，加上海潮顶托，洪水威胁的时间持续近一月之久。这在历史上也是罕见的。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的广东人民，以敢于斗争、敢于胜利的大无畏革命精神，筑成千里围堤，挡住了洪水，把它的破坏性缩小到了最低限度。结果，今年的早稻产量还比去年略有增加。
    革命化的人是“千里金堤”
    在抗洪斗争中，全省每一条堤围，都是活学活用毛主席著作的课堂。在江堤上，在帐篷里，到处都有“毛主席语录牌”。毛泽东思想给了抗洪大军以极大的鼓舞力量。六月十日至二十四日半个月内，东江流域的惠阳专区接连出现两次洪峰。全区四十多万抗洪大军坚守岗位，连续作战，确保了沿岸绝大部分主要堤围的安全。北江下游清远县有一条保卫十五万亩农田的清西围，在受到大洪峰冲击的时候，堤段连续七次沉陷，时刻有溃决的危险。五千多群众奋勇抢救了三四个昼夜，终于保住堤围。他们说：“要是在过去，人吓也被吓跑了；现在大家脑子里有了毛泽东思想，天不怕，地不怕，就挡住了洪水。”
    东江中流抗洪最紧张的地段——东莞县山洲围，是冲积沙洲，洪水一来首当其冲。过去因为这里堤围低，堤身薄，遇到洪水常常崩堤成灾。可是，这次特大洪水冲击了四天四夜，始终没有冲垮山洲围。在洪水漫堤最危急的时刻，大家都牢牢地记着毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”人们相互鼓励：“坚持就是胜利。”在堤围出险的时候，贫农社员黄发潜入水底堵塞堤围漏洞，连续坚持水下作业五个钟头。这股劲头是从哪里来的？黄发回答得很好：“是我记住了毛主席说的完全、彻底为人民服务这句话。为了保护山洲围几千群众的生命财产，那里还考虑什么个人危险啊！”
    战略上藐视敌人，在战术上重视敌人。抗洪大军按照毛主席这一光辉思想，充分发挥了主观能动性和运用了客观的有利条件，往往在紧急关头化劣势为优势，变被动为主动。清远县人民在击退北江第一次洪峰以后，树立了从最坏处考虑、向最好处争取的思 想。许多大队的民工，吃在堤上，住在堤上，学习在堤上，严阵以待。在家抢收的人，也个个备好沙包、石包，随时支援抢险。以后，虽然北江接连涌起三次洪峰，由于他们掌握了主动和优势，及时发现和堵住了数以千计的险段隐患，全县大小堤围安全无恙。清远县人民总结抗洪斗争的胜利时说：“用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是抗洪斗争的铜墙铁壁！”
    人民的利益高于一切
    中国人民解放军和各级干部，在这次抗洪斗争中，发扬了不怕苦、不怕死的革命精神，那里有险情，就战斗在那里。当东江中、下游地区千里堤围全面告急的时候，解放军某部的战士们，飞奔到已经坍坡的大堤险段，立即跳进水里，用身体筑成一条人堤，抵挡滔滔洪水，让民工们抢堵开始崩坍的大堤，保住了惠州市八万人民的安全。这些临危不惧、浑身是胆的人，时刻都牢记着：保卫人民利益是自己的神圣责任。一位战士说：“洪水是敌人，大堤是阵地，为了人民，只要有人在，洪水就休想从我们的阵地上找到缺口。”
    在抗洪最紧张的日子里，惠阳地委和各县县委领导干部，都亲临前线。他们在最困难的时刻，出现在群众面前。东莞县委书记姚文绪，得知桥头公社潼湖反洪涵漏水，威胁全县四十万亩水稻，就连夜赶到现场，亲自领导三百多群众抢救，及时把涵洞堵住。这时已是清晨四时多，他没有休息，又赶到抗洪最紧张的挂影洲堤围。
    六月二十二日，惠东县多祝公社山洪暴发。公社党委书记带领一批同志，驾船到最低洼的维德大队平岗村去抢救。上船的时候，群众再三拦阻他们，说：“船到不了平岗村就会撞沉。”他们坚决地说：“毛主席教导我们要正确对待生死问题，我们不能眼看着平岗村一千多阶级兄弟受难，就是赴汤蹈火也要去。”他们毅然决然地驾船冲进激流，赶到平岗村，把爬在楼上、屋顶上等待救援的群众，救到大船上。当时还有一个重病老人困在一所快要倒塌的房子里。因为两边的房子已经被冲塌，船开不进小巷，党委副书记丘团就带头跳下船，和其他同志一起，把老人背上了船。
    白求恩精神大放光芒
    在东江中下游地区，经常可以听到干部和社员谈到同样的几句话：“我们要向白求恩学习。”“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”毛主席的这些教导，成为当地人民抗洪斗争的最高指示。惠东县重灾区多祝公社增光大队的社员，冒着危险在洪水里捞起一头奄奄一息的耕牛。他们想到上游重灾区社员缺少耕牛，恢复生产有困难，就用精饲料饲养，等找到失主以后送回去。这种深厚的阶级感情从何而来？一位贫农社员说得好：“因为我们读了毛主席的书，心里装着‘革命’二字，私心少了，为人民、为革命的思想多了。”这不是很好反映了几千年来毒害着人们的旧的世界观正在改变，无产阶级革命的世界观正在千千万万农民的心中扎根吗！
    六月二十二日，东江洪水陡涨，山洪直冲而下，汇集到博罗县铁场公社大排灌渠里出不去，下游堤段只差几厘米就要漫顶，不少堤段已经塌坡，一万一千亩成熟待收的早稻和两千人民的住房，眼看就要被洪水吞噬。在这严重的关头，赤沥大队召开了紧急会议，决定把大队的石门楼水闸打开，把洪水引进自己的七百亩稻田里，结果保住了下游其他大队的一万多亩早稻和两千人民的房屋和财产。
    “洪水夺不去我们的双手”
    由于这场洪水凶猛异常，在一些山洪暴发的地区，一些内涝渍水未能及时排出的地区，一些堤围较低的地区，还受到了一定程度的损失。
    还在大水围困的时候，党和国家派出飞机空投粮食支援；大水刚退，一车车的粮食、农具、日用品和种子，又从四面八方运向灾区。灾区贫下中农感激地说：“这是党和毛主席的恩情。”但是，他们决心进行生产自救的斗争，不愿意过多地接受国家和各地阶级兄弟的支援。
    惠阳县水口公社龙津大队在恢复生产的过程中，缺少种子，可是社员们提出：“困难不出队，困难不出村”的口号，许多人把自己家里保留的种子送到队里。惠东县新庵公社是个重灾公社，在讨论如何恢复生产的时候，社员们说：“伸手的，吃不长；动手的，用不尽。洪灾夺不去我们的双手。”他们一不要救济物资，二不要贷款，决心靠自己的双手恢复生产。惠阳县平潭公社上寮大队是个低洼地区，大水造成了严重的损失。社员活学活用毛主席著作，表现出顽强的斗志。他们提出了最响亮的口号：“灾年也要夺丰收。”洪水退后，他们争取时间，退一丘，就种一丘。
    当时的灾区，就在那些大水还没有完全退去、有些稻田还有积水的地区，到处是一片生产大忙景象。社员们没有观望，没有等待，把恢复生产的一切工作放在自己力量的基点上，信心十足，斗志昂扬。
    广东人民战胜了这场特大洪水，同时检阅了一年来活学活用毛主席著作的巨大成就。人们更加清楚地懂得了这样一个真理：用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是战无不胜的。
