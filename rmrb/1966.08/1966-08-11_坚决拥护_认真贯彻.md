Upon receiving the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our company was filled with joy and enthusiasm. Everyone raised their hands in support and shouted with raised arms: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Communist Party of China!

The decision of the Party Central Committee has pointed out the direction for our advance. Every sentence in the decision represents the interests of the broad masses of the people. With the direct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will certainly achieve the most thorough victory. We resolutely support and will definitely carry out the decision of the Party Central Committee. In this fierce class struggle, we will definitely, according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee, distinguish right from wrong, discern truth from falsehood, and fight a thorough battle against all monsters and demons!

　　坚决拥护  认真贯彻
    当中共中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定传到我们连队后，个个欢欣鼓舞，人人举手拥护，并振臂高呼：毛主席万岁！中国共产党万岁！
    党中央的决定，给我们指明了前进的方向，决定中的每一句话，都代表了广大人民的利益。有党中央和毛主席的直接领导，这次无产阶级文化大革命一定能取得最彻底的胜利。对于党中央的决定，我们坚决拥护，坚决照办。在这次激烈的阶级斗争中，我们一定按照党中央的指示，分辨是非，辨别真假，和一切牛鬼蛇神作彻底的斗争！
