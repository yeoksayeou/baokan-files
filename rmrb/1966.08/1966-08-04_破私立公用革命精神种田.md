How Fangxiang Brigade Raised Awareness and Achieved a Bumper Harvest of Three Crops?

Cultivating with Revolutionary Spirit: Breaking Private Interests and Establishing Public Interests

Studying Chairman Mao's works has become an unshakable institution. The masses joyfully say: People listen to Chairman Mao's words, the land listens to people's words, this year's bumper harvest is the victory of applying Mao Zedong Thought in practice.

Correct human thought can only come from social practice, only from the three practices of production struggle, class struggle, and scientific experiment. People's social existence determines people's thoughts. And the correct thoughts representing the advanced class, once grasped by the masses, will become a material force to transform society and the world.

Editor's Note: Fangxiang Brigade's "three crops" yield this year has exceeded the highest level in history, from the lowest-yielding brigade in the entire commune to the highest-yielding brigade. Why is there such a big change? The fundamental reason is that they have armed their minds with Mao Zedong Thought.

Since last September, this brigade has been actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, greatly promoting the thought revolution of cadres and the masses. People use the thought of serving the public to overcome selfish and narrow-minded thoughts, use the thought of hard struggle to overcome the fear of difficulties. It rains, rush to sow in the rain; it freezes, break the ice to accumulate fertilizer; work, strive for perfection. It is in this process of fighting against nature, fighting against the land, and fighting against erroneous thoughts that they finally achieved the result of a bumper harvest of "three crops."

In socialist construction, our consistent policy is to promote revolution and production. Fangxiang Brigade, through the masses' active study and application of Chairman Mao's works and the socialist education movement, has promoted the thought revolution of people and promoted the development of production. Without Mao Zedong Thought, there would be no talk of the thought revolution of people, and without the thought revolution of people, there would be no talk of promoting the development of production. The fact of Fangxiang Brigade's bumper harvest of "three crops" indisputably proves this truth.

According to the report, Comrade Lin Biao said: "Infuse Chairman Mao's thoughts into workers and peasants, so as to change the spiritual face of the working people, and turn spiritual force into a great material force." Jiangsu Province's Yanzhou County Fangxiang Commune Fangxiang Brigade's "three crops" have increased significantly this year, which strongly proves this correct proposition. The cadres and members of Fangxiang Brigade, through the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works and the socialist education movement, have promoted thought revolutionization and promoted the development of collective production. This year's "three crops" average yield per mu has increased by 26% compared to last year, exceeding the highest level in history.

Last year, this brigade was the lowest-yielding brigade among the 18 brigades in the entire commune, and this year it has leaped to become the highest-yielding brigade. Cadres and members joyfully say: People listen to Chairman Mao's words, the land listens to people's words, this year's bumper harvest of "three crops" is the victory of applying Mao Zedong Thought in practice.

Mao Zedong Thought Changed the Spiritual Face of the Members

Under the leadership of the work team and the party branch, the cadres and members of Fangxiang Brigade, with deep class feelings of unlimited love, belief, and admiration for Chairman Mao, have been studying Chairman Mao's works extensively since last September in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. They have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's articles such as "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," "Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," "Oppose Liberalism," "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," and "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," as well as Chairman Mao's quotations on class struggle, building socialism, and advancing towards communism. They carry Chairman Mao's works with them, learn what they do, and use what they learn. They repeatedly learn and repeatedly use, doing everything according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Through learning, the cadres and members' awareness has greatly improved, and their spiritual face has greatly changed. They advocate eliminating capitalist thoughts, breaking private interests and establishing public interests, overcoming the remnants of small peasant economy thoughts, and resolutely taking the socialist road. They firmly established the thought of "cultivating for the revolution and cultivating with revolutionary spirit." The members of Songzhuang Production Team originally did not hand over cow dung to the collective. After studying Chairman Mao's works, they realized that this was harboring selfish thoughts and serving the individual. They must eliminate the "private" character to do a good job in collective production. Therefore, they rushed to hand over cow dung and family fertilizer to the collective. Room Jinchang, a poor peasant member of Fangbei Production Team, saw his wife carrying a basket of manure to the private plot one day and immediately criticized her, saying: "We should first fertilize the collective fields and then the private plots, and be a person who serves the public wholeheartedly." During last autumn's sowing, the members of this brigade all voluntarily put their private plots behind and concentrated their efforts to sow the collective fields first. They said: "Only when collective production is done well can individual life be guaranteed."

Acting According to Chairman Mao's Instructions, Cultivating with Precision

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Once the masses know the truth and have a common goal, they will work together." "Once the masses are united, everything will be easy to do." The fact of Fangxiang Brigade's bumper harvest of "three crops" vividly illustrates that Chairman Mao's instruction is an absolutely true truth. In the past, here they only plowed once and then sowed wheat, and never dug drainage ditches in the wheat fields. How to create a new level of agricultural production and produce more grain to make greater contributions to the country and the world revolution? The members brought this question and repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's quotations such as "extreme responsibility for work," "precision in technology," and "the world is afraid of the word 'serious,' the Communist Party is the most serious about 'serious.'" Everyone unified their thoughts and firmly carried out production according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Xuezhuang Production Team used to sow wheat without digging drainage ditches, and when it rained a lot, the fields would accumulate water, affecting the growth of wheat seedlings. To seize the bumper harvest of "three crops," they dug flat-bottomed fields, ensuring that when it rains a lot, water can be drained, and when it stops raining, the fields can be dry. During last autumn's sowing, Fangbei Production Team lacked cattle power, and the plowing was not done by cattle. The militia platoon leader led six core militiamen to get up early and plow the fields late. They, with the revolutionary spirit of "Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," strove for precision and ensured the quality of agricultural work. In this way, the entire brigade's wheat fields with one plowing and double harrowing increased from 14% last year to 80% this year, achieving full irrigation and drainage, and ensuring a bumper harvest in both drought and flood.

Finding the Strength to Overcome Difficulties from Chairman Mao's Works

In the past, this brigade had a weak production foundation, and agricultural tools, livestock, and funds were all insufficient. During last autumn's sowing of "three crops," they encountered the difficulty of insufficient fertilizer; to buy chemical fertilizer, they lacked funds; to ask the state for support, they also considered that the state's socialist construction needed more funds. At this time, the broad cadres and members gained great strength from Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "What is our policy based on? Based on our own strength, that is self-reliance." "We advocate self-reliance. We hope for foreign aid, but we cannot rely on it. We rely on our own efforts and the creativity of the entire army and people." "We must acknowledge difficulties, analyze difficulties, and fight against difficulties." Everyone decided to do as Chairman Mao said, take the Dazhai road, be self-reliant, and dig ponds with carts. The members of Fangbei Production Team fought for ten days, drying up a large pond that had not been dried for more than twenty years, and carrying out tens of thousands of baskets of black fertilizer, applying enough winter fertilizer to the "three crops." The members of Xudong Production Team, facing the cold wind, dried up three large ponds with carts, taking out more than forty thousand baskets of fertilizer. The members of Songzhuang Production Team, Ba Douyin and Song Yongsheng, stood in the icy pond to take water and mud, and their feet were frozen numb, but they did not complain. They said: "The water is cold, but when we think of Chairman Mao's instructions to 'overcome all difficulties and strive for victory,' our hearts become warm." In this way, after a winter and a spring of hard work, the entire brigade dried up forty-four large and small ponds with carts, carrying out tens of thousands of baskets of fertilizer, applying fertilizer to all "three crops" and green manure fields, meeting the needs of wheat seedlings.

During last autumn's sowing period, it rained continuously for many days, and some cadres and members wanted to wait for the rain to stop before sowing wheat, resulting in waiting for six or seven days, but the rain did not stop, and the wheat could not be sown. What to do? Should we bow to the sky or fight against it? The brigade party branch, with this question, convened an emergency branch meeting, leading all party members to study Chairman Mao's quotations such as "What is work? Work is struggle," "We work and struggle to solve difficulties," and "In strategy, we must despise all enemies, and in tactics, we must take all enemies seriously." Through learning, they overcame the psychology of luck and established the thought of "man can conquer nature." All party members and cadres, with tools, braved the wind and rain to lead the way to the fields to rush sow the "three crops," where there were the most and greatest difficulties, they started to work there, and the masses also followed closely. After one battle after another, they finally completed the autumn sowing task.

More Consciously Studying and Applying Mao Zedong Thought

The bumper harvest of "three crops" made the cadres and members of this brigade more deeply realize that: highlighting Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental of all work. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light of revolution, it is our lifeline. They said: Towards Mao Zedong Thought, one must love it, believe in it, rely on it, study it, propagate it, realize it, and defend it. They must more actively and consciously study and apply Chairman Mao's works.

Currently, all cadres and members of the entire brigade have formed an unshakable institution of studying Chairman Mao's works in the fields: before work, they gather in the fields, according to the current thoughts and agricultural work characteristics, read one to three quotations from Chairman Mao, and use recitation and questioning methods to memorize Chairman Mao's quotations; some illiterate members, while studying Chairman Mao's works, also study culture, and some have learned two to three hundred characters. The members of Xuxi Production Team, while transplanting seedlings, tied "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and "Learning Mao Zedong Thought to Recognize a Thousand Characters" textbooks with strings and hung them on their buttons, sticking them to their hearts. During rest time, they took them out to study. They said: "Chairman Mao's works are hung in front of the heart, the heart is red, the eyes are bright, and the direction is clear."

The cadres and members of Fangxiang Brigade have further decided that no matter what the situation is, Chairman Mao's works must be studied every day, every month, every year, and forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry out the socialist revolution to the end, and advance towards communism!

### 破私立公用革命精神种田

    方巷大队怎样提高人的觉悟夺得三麦大丰收？
    破私立公用革命精神种田
    学习毛主席著作已经成为雷打不动的制度。群众欢欣鼓舞地说：人听毛主席的话，地就听人的话，今年大丰收是活学活用毛泽东思想的胜利
    人的正确思想，只能从社会实践中来，只能从社会的生产斗争、阶级斗争和科学实验这三项实践中来。人们的社会存在，决定人们的思想。而代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。
    编者按：方巷大队今年的“三麦”产量超过了历史上的最高水平，从全公社的低产队一跃而为全公社的高产队。为什么会有这样大的变化？最根本的原因，就是他们用毛泽东思想武装了头脑。
    这个大队从去年九月开始活学活用毛主席著作，大大促进了干部和群众的思想革命化。人们用一心为公的思想克服了自私自利的思想，用艰苦奋斗的思想战胜了害怕困难的思想。下雨，冒雨抢种；结冰，破冰积肥；干活，精益求精。就在这种与天斗，与地斗，与人的错误思想斗的过程中，终于斗出了“三麦”大丰收的结果来。
    在社会主义建设中，我们历来的方针是抓革命，促生产。方巷大队通过群众活学活用毛主席著作，通过社会主义教育运动，促进了人的思想革命化，也促进了生产的发展。离开了毛泽东思想，就谈不到人的思想革命化，离开了人的思想革命化，也就谈不到促进生产的发展。方巷大队“三麦”大丰收的事实，无可辩驳地说明了这一真理。
    本报讯　林彪同志说：“把毛主席的思想灌输到工人、农民中去，才能改变劳动人民的精神面貌，才能使精神力量转化为巨大的物质力量。”江苏邗江县方巷公社方巷大队今年“三麦”大幅度增产，有力地证明了这一正确的论断。方巷大队的干部和社员通过活学活用毛主席著作，通过社会主义教育运动，促进了思想革命化，促进了集体生产的发展。今年“三麦”的平均亩产量比去年增产百分之二十六，超过了历史上的最高水平。
    去年，这个大队是全公社十八个大队中产量最低的一个队，今年一跃而为高产队。干部和社员欢欣鼓舞地说：人听毛主席的话，地就听人的话，今年的“三麦”大丰收，是活学活用毛泽东思想的胜利。
    毛泽东思想改变了社员的精神面貌
    方巷大队的干部、社员在工作队和党支部的领导下，怀着对毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜的深厚阶级感情，从去年九月起，就在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中，大学大用毛主席著作。他们反复学习了毛主席《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》、《反对自由主义》、《中国社会各阶级的分析》、《湖南农民运动考察报告》等文章，和毛主席有关阶级斗争、建设社会主义、走向共产主义等方面的语录。做到毛主席著作随身带，做什么，学什么；学什么，用什么；反复学，反复用，一切照毛主席的指示办事。通过学习，干部、社员思想觉悟大大提高，精神面貌大大改变。他们兴无灭资，破私立公，克服小农经济的思想残余，坚决走社会主义道路，牢固地树立了“为革命种田，用革命精神种田”的思想。宋庄生产队的社员，原来牛粪不交给集体，学了毛主席著作，认识到这是存私心、为个人，一定要打掉这个“私”字，才能搞好集体生产，于是争先恐后把牛粪家肥交给集体。方北生产队贫农社员房锦昌，一天看到老伴把一担粪挑到自留地上，立即批评她说：“我们要先肥大田，后肥自留地，做一个一心为公的人。”去年秋播时，这个大队的社员都主动把自留地摆在后面种，集中力量先种好大田。他们说：“集体生产搞好了，个人生活才有保障。”
    按毛主席指示办事，种田精益求精
    毛主席教导我们：“群众知道了真理，有了共同的目的，就会齐心来做。”“群众齐心了，一切事情就好办了。”方巷大队“三麦”丰收的事实，生动地说明毛主席这个教导是千真万确的真理。过去，这里只习惯耕一次就种麦，从不在麦田里挖渍水沟。怎样创造农业生产新水平，多收粮食，为国家和世界革命作出更大的贡献呢？社员们带着这个问题，反复学习了毛主席“对工作的极端的负责任”、“对技术精益求精”、“世界上怕就怕‘认真’二字，共产党就最讲‘认真’”等语录。大家统一了思想，就坚决按照毛主席的指示搞生产。薛庄生产队过去种麦不挖渍水沟，雨多了田里就积水，影响麦苗生长。为了夺取“三麦”丰收，他们就挖平底垧，做到雨多能排水，雨住田能干。方北生产队去年秋播时牛力不足，耙田没有牛拉，民兵排长就带领六个基干民兵，起早带晚拉耙耙田。他们以“愚公移山”的革命精神，精益求精，保证农活质量。这样，全大队一耕双耖的麦田，由往年的百分之十四提高到百分之八十，全面实现了能灌能排，旱涝保收。
      从毛主席著作中找到克服困难的力量
    过去，这个大队的生产底子薄，农具、畜力、资金都不足。去年秋播“三麦”时，碰到了肥料不足的困难；要买化肥，缺少资金；要求国家支援，又考虑到国家社会主义建设需要更多的资金。这时候，广大干部、社员从毛主席著作中获得了巨大的力量。毛主席说：“我们的方针要放在什么基点上？放在自己力量的基点上，叫做自力更生。”“我们是主张自力更生的。我们希望有外援，但是我们不能依赖它，我们依靠自己的努力，依靠全体军民的创造力。”“我们要承认困难，分析困难，向困难作斗争。”大家决心照毛主席的话去做，走大寨之路，自力更生，车塘挖泥。方北生产队的社员奋战十天，车干了二十多年没有干过的一个大塘，挑出了几万担乌油油的肥泥，给“三麦”追施了足够的越冬肥料。许东生产队的社员，顶着寒风，车干三个大塘，取出四万多担肥泥。宋庄生产队社员柏斗银、宋永盛站在结冰的塘里理水取泥，脚冻麻了，也不叫一声苦。他们说：“水是冰冷的，但我们想到毛主席的教导，要‘排除万难，去争取胜利’，心里就热乎乎的。”就这样，经过一冬一春的苦战，全大队车干了四十四个大小河塘，挑出了几十万担肥泥，给全部“三麦”、绿肥田施上了肥料，满足了麦苗生长的需要。
    去年秋播期间，连续下了好多天雨，部分干部和社员，想等天晴了再种麦，结果等了六七天，雨也没有停，麦子还是种不下去。怎么办？是向老天低头呢，还是与天斗呢？大队党支部带着这个问题，召开了紧急支部大会，领导全体党员学习了毛主席的“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争”、“我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的”、“在战略上我们要藐视一切敌人，在战术上我们要重视一切敌人”等语录。通过学习，克服了侥幸心理，树立了“人定胜天”的思想。全体党员、干部带着工具，顶风冒雨带头下田抢种“三麦”，那里困难最多最大，他们就在那里干起来，群众也紧紧跟上。经过一场又一场的战斗，终于胜利完成了秋播任务。
    更加自觉地活学活用毛泽东思想
    “三麦”的丰产，使这个大队的干部、社员，更加深刻地体会到：突出毛泽东思想，是搞好一切工作的根本的根本。毛泽东思想是闹革命的指路明灯，是我们的命根子。他们说：对毛泽东思想，一要热爱，二要坚信，三要依靠，四要学习，五要宣传，六要实现，七要保卫。一定要更积极、更自觉地活学活用毛主席著作。
    目前，全大队干部、社员，在田头学习毛主席著作已经形成一条雷打不动的制度：劳动前，他们集中在田头，针对活思想和农活特点，选读一到三条毛主席语录，并运用朗诵、提问的办法，记忆毛主席语录；一些不识字的社员，边学习毛主席著作，边学文化，有的已识了二三百字。许西生产队的社员在栽秧时，把《毛主席语录》和《学毛主席著作识千字》课本，用线穿起来挂在钮扣上，贴在心口，一到休息时间，就掏出来学习。他们说：“毛主席著作挂胸前，心红眼亮方向明。”
    方巷大队的干部和社员，都进一步下定决心，不管什么样的情况，毛主席著作都要天天学，月月学，年年学，永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把社会主义革命进行到底，向共产主义迈进！
