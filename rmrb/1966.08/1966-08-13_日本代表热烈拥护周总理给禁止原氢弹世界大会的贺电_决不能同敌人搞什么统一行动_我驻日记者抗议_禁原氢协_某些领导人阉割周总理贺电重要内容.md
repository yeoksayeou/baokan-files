Japanese representatives warmly endorse Premier Zhou's message to the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, stressing no unity actions with the enemy. Our correspondent in Japan protests certain leaders of the "Anti-A and H Bomb" group for mutilating Premier Zhou's message.

NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, August 12 - Tokyo: Premier Zhou Enlai's message to the 12th World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs has been warmly welcomed and endorsed by the Japanese people.

A Japanese representative attending the preparatory meeting of the 12th World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs said in Tokyo on August 2 to a Chinese journalist that he fully supports Premier Zhou Enlai's message. He said, "The message expounds Chairman Mao Zedong's views." He said, "The international united front against U.S. imperialism can only be formed by those who truly oppose U.S. imperialism, and it is absolutely impossible to include those who collude with U.S. imperialism behind the scenes." He emphasized, "We cannot have any united actions with the enemy."

Another Japanese representative said in Tokyo on August 3 to a Chinese journalist that he fully agrees with and supports Premier Zhou Enlai's message. He said that the international united front against U.S. imperialism must not include the modern revisionism centered around the Soviet Communist Party leadership. Because they have long been colluding with U.S. imperialism and have become its accomplices.

However, certain leaders of the Japanese Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, when reading this message at the Hiroshima meeting of this world conference, deliberately omitted important parts of the message. These omissions included the sections exposing U.S. imperialism's continued development and mass production of nuclear weapons, and its collusion with the Soviet modern revisionist leadership in plotting the so-called "Non-Proliferation Treaty"; the sections stating that the Chinese people have made up their minds and are fully prepared to take necessary actions at any time and place as deemed necessary by the peoples of China and Vietnam, firmly supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation; the sections supporting the Japanese people's anti-U.S. struggle and strengthening the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan; and the entire section about not including the modern revisionism centered around the Soviet Communist Party leadership in the international united front against U.S. imperialism, etc. This exposed their trampling on the glorious tradition of the world conference's opposition to U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, and opposition to Soviet revisionism, and their true intentions of advocating for "united actions" that blur the lines between enemies and friends.

On August 6, a Chinese journalist in Japan, at a press conference held by the spokesperson of the 12th World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, protested against the despicable practice of certain leaders of the Japanese Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs mutilating important parts of Premier Zhou Enlai's message.

　　日本代表热烈拥护周总理给禁止原氢弹世界大会的贺电
　　决不能同敌人搞什么统一行动
　　我驻日记者抗议“禁原氢协”某些领导人阉割周总理贺电重要内容
    新华社十二日讯　东京消息：周恩来总理打给第十二届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的贺电，受到了日本人民的热烈欢迎和拥护。
    出席第十二届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会“国际预备会议”的一位日本代表二日在东京向中国记者发表谈话，热烈支持周恩来总理的贺电。他说：“这个贺电所论述的都是毛泽东主席的观点”。他说，“反对美帝国主义的国际统一战线，只能是真正反对美帝国主义的人结合在一起，而绝不能把在幕后同美帝国主义勾结的人包括进来。”他强调说：“同敌人是不能搞什么统一行动的。”
    另一位日本代表三日在东京向中国记者发表谈话，表示全面赞同和拥护周恩来总理的贺电。他说，国际反美统一战线中决不能包括以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义。因为他们早已经同美帝国主义勾结在一起，成为美帝国主义的帮凶。
    可是，日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会的某些领导人，在这届世界大会的广岛大会上宣读这个贺电时，竟然别有用心地删节贺电的重要内容，其中包括揭露美帝国主义继续发展和大量生产核武器，勾结苏联现代修正主义领导集团积极策划所谓“防止核扩散条约”的阴谋的段落；包括申述中国人民“已经下定了决心，做好了各种准备，随时随地采取中越两国人民认为必要的行动”，坚决支持越南人民抗美救国斗争的部分；包括支持日本人民的反美斗争和加强中日两国人民的战斗友谊的段落；包括关于绝不能把以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义包括在国际反美统一战线之内一整段话，等等。这就暴露了他们践踏世界大会的反对美帝国主义及其走狗、反对苏联修正主义的破坏分裂活动的光荣传统，鼓吹模糊敌友界线的“统一行动”的真面目。
    中国驻日本记者六日在第十二届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会发言人举行的记者招待会上，对日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会某些领导人阉割周恩来总理贺电重要内容的恶劣作法，提出了抗议。
