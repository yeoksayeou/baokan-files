Friends, Comrades:

Today, the people of all circles in our capital are gathered here to warmly welcome the foreign friends who have upheld principles and fought resolutely at the 12th World Conference to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs. Your positions are clear, and you have firmly upheld the correct line and honorable traditions of the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs. The Chinese people express their highest respect to you.

Friends know that the Chinese people have sent their own delegation to participate in the 12th World Conference to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, together with you and the Japanese people, to oppose the aggressive policies and war policies of American imperialism, to support the Japanese people's struggle for complete national independence, to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation, and to support the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries. We are prepared to fight together with you and the Japanese people against American imperialism's nuclear monopoly and nuclear blackmail, to strive for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, and to fight for unity and against splittism.

However, due to the Sato government of Japan defying the will of the Japanese people, stubbornly following American imperialism, and hostile to China and the Chinese people, it unreasonably refused the entry of the head of the Chinese delegation. Therefore, the Chinese delegation could not participate in the 12th World Conference to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs. The Chinese people express great indignation over this and strongly protest against the Sato government once again.

Friends came to Japan with the same purpose as the Chinese delegation to participate in this conference. At the conference, you fought a principled struggle to uphold the correct line and honorable traditions of the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs. Unfortunately, some leaders of the Japanese Conference to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and the Japanese delegation adopted a hostile attitude towards friends who uphold principles. Despite your long and patient persuasion, they insisted on imposing their erroneous line on you. Under these circumstances, you were forced to withdraw from the conference. The Chinese people greatly admire and firmly support your just actions. We believe that the broad masses of the Japanese people will understand and support your just actions.

Everyone knows that for many years, Soviet splitters have tried every means to sabotage the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs. The resolution of the 11th World Conference pointed out that the Soviet splitters "deny the history and traditions of the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs, evade the struggle against the war forces led by American imperialism, and while shouting for the ban on atomic and hydrogen bombs, they attempt to make the movement regress and harmless to imperialism and colonialism, imposing various kinds of proposals on this movement, and have repeatedly carried out a series of split and sabotage activities." This year, the Soviet splitters not only continued to participate in the split conference but also drove the representatives they controlled from the World Federation of Democratic Youth to infiltrate the 12th World Conference to sabotage from within.

Your statement is correct: "During the 10th World Conference to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, the World Federation of Democratic Youth, with evil intentions, took the lead in organizing the split conference, sabotaging the great movement of the people of all countries to oppose the nuclear blackmail, oppression, and aggressive war policies of imperialism led by American imperialism in Japan and throughout the world." During the 12th World Conference, the World Federation of Democratic Youth persisted in the line of splittism and sent representatives to participate in the split conference. Under these circumstances, how can we allow them to infiltrate our ranks?!

You firmly opposed the participation of the representatives of the World Federation of Democratic Youth in this conference and resolutely refused to collude with the splitters, which is completely correct. Some leaders of the Japanese Conference to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and the Japanese delegation insisted on allowing the so-called World Federation of Youth representatives to participate in the conference, which is completely wrong. Friends' demand that they "admit their mistakes and apologize to the Japanese people and all peace-loving people for their responsibility for the failure of the 12th World Conference" is completely justified.

The Japanese Conference to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and some leaders of the Japanese delegation, under the slogan of "united action," accepted the participation of the representatives of the World Federation of Democratic Youth in this conference, which is not just a mistake on a local issue but a mistake in line. They sing in tune with the Soviet revisionist leadership, shouting about "strengthening the unity of all peace and democratic forces" and talking about "united action." In the end, they want to pull the number one accomplice of American imperialism, the Soviet revisionist leadership, into the anti-American united front to engage in "united action" with them. This is something we absolutely cannot agree to.

Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out in his congratulatory message to the 12th World Conference to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs: "In order to isolate and strike American imperialism to the greatest extent, the people of the world must establish the broadest and most genuine international united front against American imperialism and its lackeys. The modern revisionism centered on the leadership of the CPSU has long been in collusion with American imperialism and has become an accomplice of American imperialism. Therefore, they cannot be included in the international anti-American united front, and even less can they engage in any 'joint action.' Any proposal to engage in 'joint action' with them will only help them deceive the people of the world and smash their traitorous faces of false anti-imperialism, true surrender, false support, true betrayal, false unity, and true split."

At the 12th Conference, the friends of the 16 foreign delegations who insisted on the correct position stated in their joint declaration: "We are firmly determined to promote the establishment of a broad and genuine international united front against American imperialism and its lackeys, especially to support the indomitable struggle of the Vietnamese people. We believe that such a united front can only be composed of those who are truly engaged in anti-imperialist struggle and cannot include the agents of imperialism, that is, the accomplices controlled by the current rulers of Moscow." "The slogan of 'united action' blurs the line between enemies and friends, and this slogan is intended to open the door to the enemy (including their disguised agents trying to infiltrate our ranks)." This is completely correct. The Chinese people fully support friends' solemn declaration.

The complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons is the struggle goal that the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs has always insisted on, and it is the common aspiration of the people of the world. To achieve this goal, one of the most urgent tasks at present is to expose and condemn the conspiracy of the two nuclear powers, the United States and the Soviet Union, in Geneva, known as the negotiations to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The so-called prevention of nuclear proliferation is to allow only the United States and the Soviet Union to possess and develop nuclear weapons, while not allowing other peace-loving countries to develop nuclear weapons for self-defense. This is another big deception of the people of the world after the Moscow Three-Power Treaty.

At this World Conference, some leaders of the Japanese Conference to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and the Japanese delegation, under the pretext of differences of opinion among the peace and democratic forces on the issue of the Treaty to Prevent Nuclear Proliferation, did not condemn or expose the big conspiracy manufactured by the two countries, the United States and the Soviet Union, at this conference and in the conference documents. This is a fundamental violation of the correct line that our movement has always insisted on and cannot be said to be fighting for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons.

Comrades, friends: Currently, American imperialism has escalated its war of aggression against Vietnam to a new and more serious stage and is attempting to realize its conspiracy of "bombing for peace." Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to the Nation" published on July 17 exposed the American "peace talks" deception and once again solemnly declared the Vietnamese people's determination to persist in a long-term struggle, to fight to the end, and to drive out all American aggressors completely from Vietnam and achieve final victory. All countries and peoples who truly support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation must take active action to support the Vietnamese people in driving out the American bandits from Vietnam. Our 700 million Chinese people are the staunch rear guard of the Vietnamese people. Our vast territory is the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people. The Chinese people have made up their minds and are well prepared to take any actions deemed necessary by the peoples of China and Vietnam at any time and place to jointly strike the American aggressors.

Comrades, friends: Sino-Japanese friendship is a major issue concerning the fundamental interests of the peoples of China and Japan and a major issue concerning the future of Asia and world peace. The peoples of China and Japan must be seriously vigilant against the conspiracies of American imperialism, the Japanese reactionaries, and the Soviet revisionists to deliberately sabotage Sino-Japanese friendship. The peoples of China and Japan should make joint efforts to thoroughly smash this conspiracy. If the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan is destroyed, this will only be beneficial to American imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries, and not beneficial to the peoples of China and Japan. The history of Japanese militarism invading China in the past fully proves this.

Chairman Mao Zedong said: "Except for the pro-American monopolistic capital and militarist clique, the broad masses of the Japanese people are our true friends." The Chinese people have always followed Chairman Mao's teachings and insisted on the policy of friendship between the peoples of China and Japan. We, like the Japanese people, highly value the combat unity and friendship established between the peoples of China and Japan in the common struggle against American imperialism. Sino-Japanese friendship has developed into a powerful historical trend. Last year, the first Sino-Japanese Youth Grand Festival held in China presented many moving scenes and was a great demonstration of unity against America. Now, Chinese youth are actively preparing for the second Sino-Japanese Youth Grand Festival. We warmly welcome more Japanese youth friends to come to China to participate. The Chinese people also warmly welcome friends from all circles in Japan to visit and tour China, so that the friendship between our two peoples will continue to develop.

The Chinese people are full of confidence in developing and consolidating the friendly relations between the peoples of China and Japan. The brotherly friendship and combat unity between the peoples of China and Japan cannot be destroyed by any force. American imperialism cannot destroy it, Japanese militarism cannot destroy it, and the Soviet revisionist leadership and its various old and new followers can absolutely not destroy it. Any plot to incite, sow discord, damage, or destroy this relationship will definitely be jointly resisted and opposed by the peoples of China and Japan and will definitely fail. The peoples of China and Japan must closely unite to thoroughly smash the big conspiracy of American imperialism to control Japan, contain China, and sabotage Sino-Japanese friendship!

Comrades, friends: Under the good situation of the world people's anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle, let us raise high the banner of opposing American imperialism, raise high the banner of supporting the Vietnamese people, raise high the banner of supporting the national liberation movement, and raise high the banner of defending world peace, and march forward bravely!

Long live the great unity of the peoples of China and Japan!
Long live the great unity of the peoples of the world!

    新华社十二日讯　刘宁一在首都各界人民欢迎维护禁止原子弹氢弹世界运动光荣传统的各国朋友大会上的讲话，全文如下：朋友们，同志们：
    今天，我们首都各界人民在这里集会，热烈欢迎在第十二届禁止原氢弹世界大会上坚持原则、坚持斗争的各位外国朋友。你们立场鲜明，坚决维护禁止原氢弹运动的正确路线和光荣传统，中国人民向你们表示崇高的敬意。
    朋友们知道，中国人民已经派出了自己的代表团，准备同你们一道，同日本人民一道，参加第十二届禁止原氢弹大会，反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，支持日本人民争取完全的民族独立的斗争，支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争，支持各国人民的反帝革命斗争。准备同你们和日本人民一道，为反对美帝国主义的核垄断和核讹诈，争取实现全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器而斗争，为坚持团结，反对分裂主义而斗争。
    但是，由于日本佐藤政府违反日本人民的意愿，死心塌地追随美帝国主义，敌视中国和中国人民，横蛮无理地拒绝中国代表团团长入境，中国代表团不可能参加第十二届禁止原氢弹大会。中国人民对此表示极大的愤慨，并对佐藤政府再一次表示强烈的抗议。
    朋友们抱着同中国代表团同样的目的，到日本去参加这次大会。在会上，你们为维护禁止原氢弹运动的正确路线和光荣传统，进行了原则性的斗争。遗憾的是，日本禁止原氢弹协议会和日本代表团的某些领导人，对坚持原则的朋友们采取敌视的态度，并且一手操纵大会，不顾你们长时间的耐心劝说，硬要把他们的错误路线，强加给你们。在这种情况下，你们被迫退出大会。中国人民对你们这种正义的行动，表示极大的钦佩和坚决的支持。我们相信，广大的日本人民是会理解和支持朋友们这一正义行动的。
    大家知道，多年来，苏联分裂主义者千方百计地力图破坏禁止原氢弹运动。第十一届世界大会的决议指出，苏联分裂主义者“否定禁止原氢弹运动的历史和传统，回避同以美帝国主义为首的战争势力进行斗争，一面高喊禁止原氢弹，一面妄图使运动倒退，使之无害于帝国主义和殖民主义，把形形色色的主张强加给这一运动，多次进行了一系列的分裂和破坏勾当”。今年，苏联分裂主义者不仅继续参加分裂会议，并且驱使他们控制的世界民主青年联盟的代表打进第十二届世界大会，从内部进行破坏。
    你们的声明说得对，“在第十届禁止原氢弹世界大会期间，世界民主青年联盟怀着罪恶的目的，带头组织分裂会议，在日本和全世界破坏各国人民反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义的核讹诈、压迫和战争的侵略政策的伟大运动”。在第十二届世界大会期间，世界民主青联坚持分裂主义路线，又派遣代表参加了分裂会议。在这种情况下，怎么能够允许他们混进我们的队伍中来呢？！
    你们坚决反对世界民主青年联盟的代表参加这次会议，断然拒绝同分裂主义者同流合污，是完全正确的。日本禁止原氢弹协议会和日本代表团的某些领导人一意孤行，让所谓世界青联的代表参加大会，是完全错误的。朋友们要求他们“承认错误，并且就他们对于第十二届世界大会的失败所负的责任向日本人民和一切爱好和平的人民道歉”，是完全正当的。
    日本禁止原氢弹协议会和日本代表团的某些领导人，在“统一行动”的口号下，接纳世界民主青联代表参加这一届大会，不是局部问题上的错误，而是路线错误。他们同苏联修正主义集团唱一个调子，大叫什么“加强一切和平民主力量”的团结，大讲什么“统一行动”。说来说去，他们无非是要把美帝国主义的头号帮凶苏联修正主义领导集团拉进反美统一战线中来，同他搞“统一行动”。这是我们绝对不能同意的。
    周恩来总理在给第十二届禁止原氢弹世界大会的贺电中指出：“全世界人民为了最大限度地孤立和打击美帝国主义，必须建立一个最广泛的、最真实的、反对美帝国主义及其走狗的国际统一战线。”“以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义早已同美帝国主义勾结在一起，成为美帝国主义的帮凶。因此，绝不能把他们包括在国际反美统一战线之内，更不能同他们搞什么‘联合行动’。任何要同他们搞‘联合行动’的主张，只会帮助他们欺骗世界人民，粉碎他们假反帝、真投降，假支持、真出卖，假团结、真分裂的叛徒面目。”
    在第十二届大会上，坚持正确立场的十六个外国代表团的朋友们，在共同声明中表示：“坚定不移地决心促进建立一个广泛的、真正的、反对美帝国主义及其走狗的，特别是声援越南人民英勇不屈的斗争的国际统一战线。我们相信，这样一个统一战线只能由真正从事反帝斗争的人们组成，而不能包括帝国主义的代理人，即受莫斯科现统治者控制的同谋者”。“所谓‘统一行动’的口号，模糊了敌友之间的界线，这个口号是打算向敌人（包括试图钻进我们的队伍的它的伪装的代理人）敞开大门”。这是完全正确的。中国人民完全支持朋友们的这个严正的声明。
    全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器，是禁止原氢弹运动始终坚持的斗争目标，是全世界人民的共同愿望。为了实现这个目标，当前最迫切的任务之一，就是要揭露和谴责美苏两个核大国在日内瓦进行的所谓防止核扩散谈判的阴谋。所谓防止核扩散，就是只许美苏拥有和发展核武器，而不许其他爱好和平国家发展核武器来进行自卫。这是继莫斯科三国条约之后的又一个愚弄世界人民的大骗局。
    在这一届世界大会上，日本禁止原氢弹协议会和日本代表团的某些领导人，借口和平民主力量在“防止核扩散条约”问题上有意见分歧，在这次大会上、在大会的文件中，竟然不谴责、不揭露苏美两国制造的这个大阴谋。这就根本违背了我们运动一贯坚持的正确路线，根本谈不上为全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器而斗争。
    同志们，朋友们：目前美帝国主义已经把侵略越南的战争上升到一个新的更严重的阶段，并妄图实现“以炸迫和”的阴谋。胡志明主席七月十七日发表的《告全国同胞书》，揭露了美国的“和谈”骗局，再一次庄严宣告越南人民坚持长期抗战的决心，坚决要打下去，打到底，直到把美国侵略者全部彻底赶出越南，取得最后胜利。一切真正支持越南人民抗美救国战争的国家和人民，必须积极行动起来，支持越南人民把美国强盗从越南赶出去。我们七亿中国人民，是越南人民的坚强后盾。我们辽阔的国土，是越南人民的可靠后方。中国人民下定了决心，作好了各种准备，随时随地采取中越两国人民认为必要的行动，共同打击美国侵略者。
    同志们，朋友们：中日友好，是关系到中日两国人民根本利益的大事，是关系到亚洲前途和世界和平的大事。中日两国人民必须严重地警惕美帝国主义、日本反动派和苏联修正主义蓄意破坏中日友好的阴谋。中日两国人民应当共同努力，彻底粉碎这个阴谋。如果中日两国人民的友谊遭到破坏，这只能有利于美帝国主义，有利于日本反动派，而不利于中日两国人民。过去日本军国主义侵略中国的历史，充分地证明了这一点。
    毛泽东主席说：“日本除了亲美的垄断资本和军国主义军阀之外，广大人民都是我们的真正朋友。”中国人民一贯遵循毛主席的教导，坚持中日两国人民友好的方针。我们同日本人民一样，非常珍视中日两国人民在反对美帝国主义的共同斗争中所建立起来的战斗团结和友谊。中日友好，已发展成一股强大的历史潮流。去年在中国举行的第一届中日青年大联欢，出现了许多激动人心的情景，是一次团结反美的大示威。现在，中国青年正在积极筹备第二届中日青年大联欢。我们热烈欢迎更多的日本青年朋友到中国来参加。中国人民还热烈欢迎日本各界朋友到中国参观访问，使我们两国人民的友谊日益发展。
    中国人民对于发展和巩固中日两国人民的友好关系充满信心。中日两国人民之间的兄弟友谊和战斗团结，是任何力量也破坏不了的。美帝国主义破坏不了，日本军国主义破坏不了，苏联修正主义领导集团及其形形色色的新旧追随者也绝对破坏不了。任何挑拨、离间、损害、破坏这种关系的阴谋活动，必将遭到中日两国人民的共同抵制和反对，是一定要破产的。中日两国人民紧密地团结起来，彻底粉碎美帝国主义控制日本、遏制中国、破坏中日友好的大阴谋！
    同志们，朋友们：在世界人民反帝革命斗争的大好形势下，让我们高举反对美帝国主义的旗帜，高举支持越南人民的旗帜，高举支持民族解放运动的旗帜，高举保卫世界和平的旗帜，奋勇前进！
    中日两国人民大团结万岁！
    世界人民大团结万岁！（附图片）
