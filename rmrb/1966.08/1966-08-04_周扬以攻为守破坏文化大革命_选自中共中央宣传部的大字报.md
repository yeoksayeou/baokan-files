    Zhou Yang Uses Offensive Tactics to Sabotage the Cultural Revolution
    —Excerpt from a Big-Character Poster from the Central Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China

    Editor's Note: Today, we are publishing a big-character poster exposing Zhou Yang's opposition to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This provides us with another negative example: People like Zhou Yang, who have infiltrated the Party and represent the old bourgeoisie, will inevitably use a set of flexible counter-revolutionary strategies to realize their dream of capitalist restoration. As Chairman Mao pointed out in 1955 when criticizing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique: “They have long experience in class struggle, and they will fight in various forms—legal and illegal.” Chairman Mao also emphasized: “When they are in an unfavorable situation, in order to protect their current existence and facilitate future development, they often adopt the strategy of attacking to defend themselves.” Zhou Yang used precisely this counter-revolutionary strategy during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Since 1962, when Chairman Mao issued the great call to “Never forget class struggle” and repeatedly severely criticized the literary and artistic circles for not implementing the Party's policies, Zhou Yang and his gang realized that the situation was unfavorable for them. They adopted a series of strategies of attacking to defend themselves, using every means to resist and sabotage the Cultural Revolution, engaging in fake rectification movements and fake criticism, one thing in public and another in private, step by step, constantly counterattacking, trying to preserve themselves and waiting for an opportunity to “rise again.” However, this time, their strategy failed, and even Zhou Yang, the cunning leader of the black gang, was exposed.

    “The devil is high, but the way is higher.” The broad masses of workers, peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have accumulated and created rich experiences in class struggle in the ideological field, especially in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings: “We revolutionary party members must understand their tricks, study their strategies, so as to defeat them. We must not be naive and simplistically view complex class struggles.” We must use the “way” of Mao Zedong Thought to persistently fight to the end with all the ghosts and monsters! We will not rest until all the demons are eliminated!

    The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has exposed the anti-Party, anti-socialist black line in the literary and artistic circles, revealing the ghosts and monsters in the literary and artistic circles to the world, and also exposing Zhou Yang, the leader of the literary and artistic black gang.

    Before this, Zhou Yang had been plotting to sabotage this Cultural Revolution.

    In September 1965, Chairman Mao instructed at a meeting of the Party Central Committee that it was necessary to criticize bourgeois reactionary thoughts. In November of the same year, under the direct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China first launched a criticism of Wu Han's “Hai Rui Dismissed from Office,” a big poisonous weed. Therefore, as the advocate of the “Hai Rui spirit” and the mastermind and planner of another big poisonous weed, “Hai Rui's Memorial,” Zhou Yang could not help but be frightened and terrified. When Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article “On the New Historical Drama ‘Hai Rui Dismissed from Office’” came out, Zhou Yang and the main responsible comrades of the former Beijing Municipal Committee regarded this article as a flood and a beast, and conspired together to form a chorus to resist and oppose this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    First, they used every means to resist and block Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article and spread various fallacies to resist the Cultural Revolution.

    After Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article was published, the second-in-command of the Zhou Yang literary and artistic black gang, Lin Mo Han, still claimed at a meeting of literary and artistic journal editors that it had not been decided whether to criticize “Hai Rui Dismissed from Office,” and if it was to be criticized, it was a matter of historical issues. Lin Mo Han also tried to exonerate Wu Han, saying: The objective effect of “Hai Rui Dismissed from Office” is to hint at reality, and Wu Han's subjective motive is known only to himself.

    Second, Zhou Yang and the boss of the “Three Family Village” black gang, Deng Tuo, organized articles of fake criticism and real protection to resist the Cultural Revolution.

    Zhou Yang fully demonstrated his counter-revolutionary initiative, conspiring and discussing with black gang members Deng Tuo and Li Qi, throwing out one article after another, ostensibly criticizing but actually protecting. Zhou Yang also personally presided over the writing of an article signed by Fang Qiu, using the method of conciliation, talking extensively about the issue of clean officials. The purpose was to lead the political struggle in the cultural field into so-called pure academic discussions that do not involve political issues. After this article was published, Zhou Yang was very pleased and spread rumors everywhere, stirring up a cold wind of belittling Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article and elevating Fang Qiu's article.

    In January 1966, Zhou Yang was hospitalized due to illness. However, his counter-revolutionary initiative increased rather than decreased, and he still conspired with black gang member Li Qi every day, discussing how to make the articles of fake criticism more ingenious.

    Zhou Yang's opposition to the Cultural Revolution has been long-standing.

    After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party in 1962, Chairman Mao made several extremely important instructions on the issue of cultural revolution. But Zhou Yang refused to implement them and instead adopted various despicable means, either not transmitting them, or paying lip service while acting against them, or singing the opposite tune, and brazenly engaging in activities of opposition and sabotage.

    In 1962, Chairman Mao issued the great call to “Never forget class struggle” at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and also made important instructions on literary and artistic work, pointing out that some people use writing novels to engage in anti-Party activities and create public opinion for capitalist restoration. Zhou Yang was precisely the booster and supporter of anti-Party novels. However, he refused to accept Chairman Mao's criticism, strenuously exonerating and defending his own anti-Party words and deeds, and not criticizing anti-Party works at all.

    In December 1963, Chairman Mao pointed out: Various forms of art—drama, folk art, music, fine arts, dance, film, poetry, and literature, etc.—have many problems, many people, and socialist transformation in many fields has so far achieved little. Many fields are still ruled by “dead people.” Chairman Mao also said: Many communists enthusiastically advocate feudal and capitalist art but are not enthusiastic about advocating socialist art. Isn't this strange?

    To such important instructions from Chairman Mao, Zhou Yang openly sang the opposite tune. He continued to advocate feudal and capitalist art everywhere, even proposing the policy of advocating traditional feudal operas, new historical operas (i.e., ghost operas, bad operas, operas about emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, etc.), and modern operas together. For comrades who insist on holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought and actively advocate socialist art, he added horizontal blows and various difficulties. In January 1964, the East China region held a modern opera performance, and Zhou Yang and Lin Mo Han jointly resisted and poured cold water on it. In June 1964, a modern Beijing opera performance was held, and they did not care about the preparatory work at all. Lin Mo Han even said to the comrades of the Art Department of the Propaganda Department on the eve of the performance that the music and dance of Beijing opera are not suitable for performing modern operas.

    Since liberation, the Zhou Yang black gang has recruited and accommodated traitors, formed cliques, and implemented a revisionist literary and artistic line, turning the literary and artistic circles into their anti-Party independent kingdom. Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee have long been aware of these phenomena and have repeatedly criticized and fought against them.

    In June 1964, Chairman Mao pointed out again: In the literary and artistic circles over the past fifteen years, basically (not all people) the Party's policies have not been implemented, officials have been made, and workers, peasants, and soldiers have not been approached, and the revolution and construction of socialism have not been reflected. In recent years, it has even fallen to the brink of revisionism. If it is not seriously reformed, it will inevitably become a group like the Petofi Club in Hungary on some future day.

    Chairman Mao's instructions were another warning bell for people like Zhou Yang. However, this black gang leader, Zhou Yang, was stubborn and unrepentant. He not only did not accept Chairman Mao's criticism and examine his own crimes but also played a new trick: picking up the banner of cultural revolution and rectification to oppose cultural revolution and rectification. His methods were twofold: one was to engage in fake rectification in the Ministry of Culture and various federations of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the other was to engage in fake criticism in newspapers and periodicals. The purpose was to sacrifice the carriage to save the horse, cover up the root of the literary and artistic black line, and save himself.

    In July 1964, the farce of fake rectification that Zhou Yang staged in the Ministry of Culture and various federations of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles had just begun, and Zhou Yang limited the exposed problems to a few carriages that were painfully sacrificed. As for problems involving other people, whether in meetings or reflecting on the situation, they were all silenced. At a rectification meeting, someone criticized the “overall spirit of the document formulated by Zhou Yang and Lin Mo Han as rightist”; someone demanded that they “self-criticize more.” Zhou Yang, upon hearing this, was extremely frightened, saying that the person who raised the issue had planted a “time bomb” and threatened not to leak such opinions outward. Under Zhou Yang's various suppressions, the rectification of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles finally ended in a hasty manner. The problem of the literary and artistic black line was not touched at all. For a few carriages that were painfully “criticized,” Zhou Yang was extremely soothing: those who had been transferred to work were all treated according to their original positions; those who had not been demoted were even more afraid of neglecting and grieving them. Finally, Zhou Yang made a so-called rectification summary report, extolling his own merits and dressing himself up as a “hero” of rectification. In another speech, Zhou Yang even boasted that this fake rectification was the second great rectification movement after the Yan'an rectification movement. This clown, Zhou Yang, was simply shameless to the extreme!

    Not long after the fake rectification began, Zhou Yang's fake criticism in newspapers and periodicals also started. All ghosts and monsters and poisonous weeds were the lifeblood of Zhou Yang, of course, could not be criticized and eradicated. For those big poisonous weeds that had already been exposed and could not be covered up, Zhou Yang played the trick of fake criticism, going through the motions, deceiving people's eyes. To achieve the goal of fake criticism and real protection, Zhou Yang set several rules for newspapers and periodicals: criticism was not allowed without the approval of the relevant leading organs (i.e., Zhou Yang, Lin Mo Han, etc.); only criticism of literary and artistic thought problems was allowed, not political problems; only criticism of the works themselves was allowed, not criticism of issues hinting at reality; only criticism of open articles was allowed, not various activities and speeches; only a few “authorities” were allowed to write one or two articles, not allowing workers, peasants, and soldiers to participate in the big criticism, etc. These rules were all to restrict the hands and feet of the proletarian leftists and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to open a broad way for the representatives of the bourgeoisie. In a word, Zhou Yang wanted to set up various obstacles, allowing only ghosts and monsters to attack fiercely, and not allowing the revolutionary masses to counterattack.

    After this, literary and artistic criticism almost completely stopped. Because Zhou Yang was the booster of “The Story of Ah Q” in the 1930s, Comrade Mu Xin's article criticizing Xia Yan's “The Story of Ah Q” was suppressed and not allowed to be published. Tian Han's “Xie Yaohuan” is a big poisonous weed against the Party and socialism. In early 1964, a responsible comrade of the Central Committee pointed out that it should be criticized, but in more than two years, not a single critical article was published.

    Zhou Yang thought that through various conspiracies, he could cover the sky with one hand, sabotage the Cultural Revolution, and cover up the root of the literary and artistic black line. But things turned out contrary to his wishes. His series of anti-Party activities exposed his true face as the leader of the literary and artistic black gang. In the torrent of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the 700 million people armed with great Mao Zedong Thought all became critics, and all ghosts and monsters had no place to hide. Zhou Yang and these dregs of history also became pitiful creatures, weeping in the corner.

    周扬以攻为守破坏文化大革命
    ——选自中共中央宣传部的大字报
    编者按：今天选登的揭发周扬反对无产阶级文化大革命的大字报，又向我们提供了一个反面教材：象周扬这类混进党内的老牌资产阶级代表人物，为了实现他们的资本主义复辟美梦，必然要用一套随机应变的反革命策略。正如毛主席在一九五五年批判胡风反革命集团时指出的：“他们有长期的阶级斗争经验，他们会做各种形式的斗争——合法的斗争和非法的斗争。”毛主席还着重指出：“当着他们处在不利情况的时候，为了保护他们现在的生存，以利将来的发展，他们往往采取以攻为守的策略。”周扬在无产阶级文化大革命中采取的正是这种反革命策略。从一九六二年毛主席发出“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”伟大号召，并且多次严厉地批评文艺界不执行党的政策之后，周扬黑帮自知形势对他们不利，便采取了一系列以攻为守的策略，千方百计地抗拒和破坏文化大革命，大搞假整风，大搞假批判，明里一套，暗里一套，步步为营，不断反扑，力图保存自己，伺机“东山再起”。但是，这一回，他们这套策略失灵了，连周扬这个老奸巨猾的黑帮总头目也被一起揪出来了。
    “魔高一尺，道高一丈”。以毛泽东思想武装起来的广大工农兵、革命干部和革命知识分子，在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，特别是在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，积累了并且创造着丰富的在意识形态领域里进行阶级斗争的经验。我们将始终牢记毛主席的教导：“我们革命党人必须懂得他们这一套，必须研究他们的策略，以便战胜他们。切不可书生气十足，把复杂的阶级斗争看得太简单了。”我们一定要用毛泽东思想之“道”，坚持不懈地同一切牛鬼蛇神之“魔”斗争到底！不灭群魔，誓不罢休！
    无产阶级文化大革命，揭开了文艺界反党反社会主义黑线的盖子，把文艺界的牛鬼蛇神暴露在光天化日之下，也把周扬这个文艺黑帮总头目揪了出来。
    在此以前，周扬一直阴谋破坏这场文化大革命。
    一九六五年九月，毛主席在一次党中央的会议上指示，必须批判资产阶级的反动思想。同年十一月，在毛主席和党中央的直接领导下，中共上海市委首先发动了对吴晗《海瑞罢官》这棵大毒草的批判。因此，作为“海瑞精神”的鼓吹者、另一棵大毒草《海瑞上疏》的炮制者和策划者的周扬，不能不心惊胆颤，闻风丧胆。姚文元同志《评新编历史剧〈海瑞罢官〉》的文章一出来，周扬和前北京市委的主要负责人就把这篇文章视为洪水猛兽，并且互相密谋，组成了抵制和反对这场无产阶级文化大革命的合唱队。
    第一步，他们千方百计抵制和封锁姚文元同志的文章，并且散播各种谬论，抗拒文化大革命。
    姚文元同志的文章发表以后，周扬文艺黑帮的二号头目林默涵仍然在一次文艺报刊负责人的会议上扬言，说要不要批评《海瑞罢官》还没有决定，如果要批评，也是属于历史方面的问题。林默涵还为吴晗开脱罪责说：《海瑞罢官》的客观效果是影射现实的，吴晗的主观动机怎样，只有他自己知道。
    第二步，由周扬和“三家村”黑帮的掌柜邓拓分别组织假批判、真包庇的文章，对抗文化大革命。
    周扬充分发挥了他的反革命积极性，和黑帮分子邓拓、李琪密谋协商，抛出一篇又一篇名为批判，实为包庇的文章。周扬还亲自主持撰写了署名方求的文章，玩弄折衷主义的手法，大谈清官问题。其目的是要把文化领域中的政治斗争，引入到不谈政治问题的所谓纯学术讨论中去。这篇文章发表后，周扬非常得意，到处散布流言蜚语，煽起了一股贬低姚文元同志文章，抬高方求文章的阴风。
    一九六六年一月，周扬因病进了医院。但他的反革命积极性却有增无减，还整天和黑帮分子李琪密谋，商议如何把假批判的文章搞得更巧妙一些。
    周扬反对文化大革命是由来已久的。
    一九六二年，党的八届十中全会以后，毛主席对文化革命问题作了多次极为重要的指示。但周扬拒不执行，反而采取了各种卑劣的手段，或不传达，或阳奉阴违，或大唱反调，猖狂地进行反对和破坏的活动。
    一九六二年，毛主席在党的八届十中全会上发出了“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大号召，对文艺工作也作了重要指示，指出有人利用写小说进行反党活动，为资本主义复辟制造舆论。周扬正是反党小说的吹捧者和支持者。但是，对于毛主席的批评，周扬拒不接受，竭力为自己的反党言行开脱，辩解，对反党作品更不加批判。
    一九六三年十二月，毛主席指出：各种艺术形式——戏剧、曲艺、音乐、美术、舞蹈、电影、诗和文学等等，问题不少，人数很多，社会主义改造在许多部门中，至今收效甚微。许多部门至今还是“死人”统治着。毛主席还说：许多共产党人热心提倡封建主义和资本主义的艺术，却不热心提倡社会主义的艺术，岂非咄咄怪事。
    对毛主席这样重要的指示，周扬竟然公开唱反调。他继续到处宣扬封建主义和资本主义的艺术，甚至提出所谓封建主义传统戏、新编历史戏（即鬼戏、坏戏，帝王将相、才子佳人戏等等）、现代戏三者并举的方针。对于坚持高举毛泽东文艺思想红旗，积极提倡社会主义艺术的同志，则横加打击，百般刁难。一九六四年一月，华东区举行现代戏会演，周扬和林默涵一起大加抵制，大泼冷水。一九六四年六月，举行京剧现代戏会演，他们根本不管会演的筹备工作。林默涵还在会演的前夕，对中宣部文艺处同志说，京剧的音乐、舞蹈，不适宜于演现代戏。
    解放以来，周扬黑帮招降纳叛、结党营私，制定和推行一条修正主义文艺路线，把文艺界变成他们反党的独立王国。毛主席和党中央对这些现象早有所觉察，并且不断地进行过批评和斗争。
    一九六四年六月，毛主席再一次指出：文艺界十五年来，基本上（不是一切人）不执行党的政策，做官当老爷，不去接近工农兵，不去反映社会主义的革命和建设。最近几年，竟然跌到了修正主义的边缘。如不认真改造，势必在将来的某一天，要变成象匈牙利裴多菲俱乐部那样的团体。
    毛主席的指示，是给周扬这些人敲的又一次警钟。可是，周扬这个黑帮头子执迷不悟，死不回头。他不仅不接受毛主席的批评，检查自己的罪行，反而玩弄了一个新的阴谋，就是抓起文化革命和整风的旗帜，来反对文化革命和整风。其手法有二：一是在文化部和文联各协会搞假整风，一是在报刊上搞假批判。目的是舍车保帅，掩盖文艺黑线的根子，保他自己。
    一九六四年七月，周扬在文化部和文联各协会搞的假整风的丑剧刚刚开始，周扬便把揭发的问题限制在几个忍痛牺牲的车马上。凡是涉及到其他人的问题，不管是开会也好，还是反映情况也好，一概封口。在一次整风会上，有人批评周扬、林默涵制定的一个文件的“整个精神是右的”；有人要求他们“自我批评要多一点”。周扬听了，惊恐万分，说提意见的人是埋下了“定时炸弹”，威胁不准向外泄露这种意见。在周扬的种种压制下，文联各协会的整风最后草草收场。文艺黑线的问题，根本没有触及。对几个忍痛“批判”一下的车马，周扬更是抚慰备至：凡调动了工作的，一律按原职务待遇；没有罢官的，更是生怕冷落委屈了他们。最后，周扬作了一个所谓整风总结报告，大肆吹嘘自己的功劳，把他自己打扮成为整风的“英雄”。在另一次讲话中，周扬甚至吹嘘说这次假整风是延安文艺整风运动以后的第二次伟大的整风运动。周扬这个小丑，简直到了恬不知耻的地步！
    假整风开始不久，周扬在报刊上搞的假批判也鸣锣开场了。一切牛鬼蛇神和毒草，都是周扬的命根子，当然不得批判，不得铲除。对那些已经暴露，无法掩盖的大毒草，周扬玩弄了假批判的花样，走走过场，遮人耳目。为了达到假批判真包庇的目的，周扬给报刊制定了几条清规戒律：不经过有关领导机构（即周扬、林默涵等人）批准，不得批判；只许批判文艺思想问题，不许批判政治问题；只许批判作品本身，不许批判影射现实的问题；只许批判公开的文章，不许批判各种活动和讲话；只许少数“权威”写一两篇文章，不许工农兵参加大批判，等等。这些清规戒律，都是为了束缚无产阶级左派和广大工农兵的手脚，给资产阶级代表人物广开生路。一句话，周扬就是要设置重重障碍，只准牛鬼蛇神猖狂进攻，不许革命群众反击。
    自此以后，文艺批判几乎完全停顿了。因为周扬在三十年代就是《赛金花》的吹捧者，穆欣同志批判夏衍的《赛金花》的文章，被压下不准发表。田汉的《谢瑶环》是反党反社会主义的大毒草，一九六四年初，中央负责同志便指出应当批判，但在两年多的时间里，始终没有发表一篇批判文章。
    周扬以为通过各种各样阴谋活动，可以一手遮天，破坏文化大革命，掩盖住文艺黑线的根子。但事与愿违，他进行的一系列反党活动，正好暴露了他文艺黑帮头子的真面目。在无产阶级文化大革命的洪流中，以伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿人民，都成了批评家，一切牛鬼蛇神，都无藏身之地，周扬这些历史的渣滓，也成了向隅而泣的可怜虫。
