More than a thousand people from various sectors in the capital gathered this afternoon to celebrate the national day of the Socialist Republic of Romania.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian of the State Council attended the meeting.

Vice Chairman Zhou Wenlong of the China-Romania Friendship Association and Romanian Ambassador to China Aurel Duma both delivered speeches at the meeting.

Zhou Wenlong said that the Romanian Communist Party, government, and people have been continuously fighting to safeguard Romania's independence and sovereignty and to uphold the principles of fraternal party and state relations. The Romanian people have made active contributions in the struggle against the aggressive and war policies of imperialism.

Zhou Wenlong strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists' aggression against Vietnam, stating that the Chinese people resolutely and fervently support Chairman Ho Chi Minh's combat declaration. He severely denounced the Soviet revisionist leadership's peddling of "peace talks" schemes, acting as the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism. He said, "We must not engage in any 'joint actions' with them; we can only draw a clear line of demarcation and fight to the end."

Zhou Wenlong introduced the ongoing Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. He said that the revolutionary masses of China, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are carrying out this unprecedented cultural revolution with the force of a thousand thunderbolts, which will lead China's socialist revolution and socialist construction to new and great victories.

Zhou Wenlong said that there is a traditional deep friendship between the peoples of China and Romania. We are confident that in the future socialist construction, in the struggle against imperialism led by the United States, in the struggle against hegemony, and in the struggle for world peace, national liberation, people's democracy, and socialism, the friendship between the Chinese and Romanian peoples will be further consolidated and developed.

Ambassador Aurel Duma said in his speech that Romania's international relations are based on the unshakable principles of independence and sovereignty, equality of rights, non-interference in internal affairs, and mutual benefit. Romania is resolutely fighting to ensure that every nation's people have the right to determine their own destiny.

The ambassador said that the Romanian people and government resolutely condemn U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam and fully support the four-point proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, believing that they are the only correct basis for resolving the Vietnam issue.

The ambassador said that the Romanian people and the Chinese people have a fraternal cooperative relationship. Currently, the cooperative relationship between our two countries is developing.

Guests invited to the meeting included officials from the Romanian Embassy in China and Romanian friends in Beijing.

The meeting was organized by the China-Romania Friendship Association and the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions.
