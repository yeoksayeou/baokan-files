	At the Rally of the People of All Circles in the Capital Opposing American Imperialism and Supporting the Struggle of American Blacks Against Racial Discrimination

	Comrades, brothers and sisters, patriots, revolutionaries:

	I wish to once again express my gratitude to Chairman Mao Zedong and our brothers, the great Chinese people, for their support of our struggle. On this occasion of commemorating the third anniversary of Chairman Mao Zedong's call for the people of the world to unite and oppose American imperialism's racial discrimination and support the struggle of American blacks against racial discrimination, I would like to analyze and evaluate the current state of the struggle of American blacks. This is the best way to praise the immortal declaration of Chairman Mao.

	Chairman Mao's declaration on August 8, 1963, was an inspiration to a nation that had long suffered brutal oppression and the denial of human dignity, a nation that was deeply poisoned by the philosophy of neo-Gandhism. Chairman Mao's words pushed forward a weak armed self-defense movement that was struggling to advance. Today, the growing storm of armed resistance is sweeping away the strongholds of savage imperialism and beastly racism, shocking and terrifying all reactionaries in the world. In the northern cities, small towns, rural areas, and dense forests of the South, from the East Coast to the West Coast, the oppressed and dehumanized blacks are using revolutionary violence to counter the violent oppression of racist terrorists. The thunderous call for "Black Power" echoes across the nation. A mighty storm of fire is sweeping through the volatile black ghettos. The imperialist tyrants, surrounded by the terrible weapons of mass destruction they have stolen to build their paradise, are trembling with fear as they face the struggle of emaciated, angry slaves armed with ordinary knives and Molotov cocktails.

	What does "Black Power" mean in the land ruled by the white invaders who killed and nearly exterminated the legitimate owners of America, the Indians? Black Power means blacks demanding control over their own lives and having a respected voice in public affairs that concern them. We oppose being treated as colonial peoples, as third-class citizens in our own birthplace. We oppose not being allowed to speak for ourselves, even in areas where we make up 85% of the population. We oppose being forced into the mold of whites in a degenerate white-supremacist society, which mocks and degrades our African cultural heritage and makes us ashamed of our national characteristics. We hope that through the tool of Black Power, we will reach a stage where we can be proud to be black without having to apologize for not looking like Anglo-Saxons. In racist America, the current society is reactionary, imperialist, racist, and decadent. We want to break away from it. The racist white power structure is evil, killing the people of Vietnam and threatening the world with nuclear annihilation. Black Power is a force challenging it.

	We have endured the harm of white racism in this new continent for four hundred years. We have endured the atrocities of racism under the existing form of government for nearly two hundred years. Our people are being slaughtered like pigs on the streets of racist America. Our churches and homes are being bombed. Our women are being raped with impunity. Our men are being castrated. We are hated and killed simply because we were born black. Because we refuse to praise and love those savage oppressors, we are called racists.

	We are an oppressed people. Our goal is to break the cruel stranglehold of our enemies, our oppressors. An opponent who lacks the courage to point out the true nature of the enemy cannot confront and defeat it. We propose to call our enemy by its true name. We propose to unite our people on this basis and wage the struggle. We do not intend to be hesitant about peaceful coexistence. A timid sheep cannot coexist peacefully with a savage wolf; this is a law of nature.

	Yes, in our struggle, there are some white Americans who stand with us. They are our true brothers. These revolutionaries understand our anger and are equally angry. They know this is righteous anger. They have inherited and carried on the glorious spirit of the great and noble warrior against slavery, John Brown. Yes, they are also hated and persecuted minorities in a society ruled by a majority of Johnson's thugs and Hitler-like might-makes-right. Yes, just like the people of other countries, there are also enemies in our ranks. We have black traitors who will sell out for thirty pieces of silver. We have black Judas Iscariots who are stupid lackeys serving the Johnson government and its racist white power. These black puppets and their white masters will not last long.

	Our anger towards those black traitors who act as lackeys for white oppressors is as strong as our anger towards white supremacist oppressors. These hired Uncle Toms are the loudest advocates of non-violent peace in the storm center of racist America today. The ghettos are burning, but they advocate surrendering to the continuing tyranny and oppression.

	Johnson, this champion of civil rights, this former senator from racist Texas, voted against every civil rights bill submitted to the U.S. Senate when he was a senator. As long as American blacks passively allow themselves to be abused and slaughtered by white supremacist thugs and enforcers, Johnson can be the savior Moses of today's American blacks. But now that he has the brutal white supremacist national power, he threatens those who defend themselves, their homes, their wives, and children. Johnson, the big boss of white supremacy, often reminds our people that we are a minority, while the brutal racist beasts are the majority. Like his fellow travelers in the Ku Klux Klan, he tries to intimidate and threaten us with the majority of oppressors who are always on top of us. Just as he tries to threaten the Chinese people with a large stockpile of nuclear weapons, Johnson also tries to threaten American blacks with a large number of white supremacists who are ready and willing to exterminate our nation. We want to tell Mr. Johnson that threats, violence, and brutality cannot extinguish the blazing fire of people's liberation struggles. The only force that can extinguish the fires in the ghettos and streets of racist America is fairness, brotherhood, equality, and justice.

	We warn the big boss from Texas, Johnson, that just as he cannot intimidate the Chinese people with nuclear attacks, he cannot intimidate American blacks with his pack of mad dog-like racists. The days when savage white racist oppressors and imperialists could use savage violence to force people of color to submit are gone forever.

	We revolutionary American blacks respond to Mr. Johnson and his white supremacist Ku Klux Klan with the cries of "Black Power!" "Freedom now!" "Justice!" We declare: a life of dignity is our inalienable right, and we will achieve our demands with blood and fire. Yes, Mr. Johnson, we are a minority, but we are an oppressed minority, a minority determined to gain freedom at any cost. For freedom, we are determined to make every effort, pay any price, and carry out any mission.

	Yes, we are a minority, but we are a powerful minority because our cause is just, and justice is on our side. The mighty, invincible forces against imperialism and racism from all over the world form a great, multi-ethnic mass movement, and we are advancing in this column. Since Mr. Johnson attaches so much importance to numbers, for his own good, we remind him again with the words of a great leader of the people. This great leader is the liberator of humanity, whose words, thoughts, and teachings stand firm like a mighty rock in the stormy waves of the Strait of Gibraltar. Yes, we remind him again, our great leader and teacher, Chairman Mao Zedong, has said:

		"...They are a minority, we are the majority. Of the world's three billion people, they account for less than ten percent at most. I am deeply convinced that with the support of more than ninety percent of the people of the world, the just struggle of American blacks is bound to be victorious. The evil system of colonialism and imperialism, which rose to prosperity with the enslavement and trafficking of blacks, will also come to an end with the complete liberation of the black race."

	Today, in the jungle of racist America, the rights of a common street dog are greater than those of people of color. The laws of the so-called "Christian" democracy of the free world and its lawless courts protect the rights of street dogs and other mute animals, but no court in the United States treats colored people fairly and justly, guaranteeing them equal constitutional rights and human rights. Throughout the savage history of the United States, the miserable fate of blacks, worse than that of cattle, constitutes the most shameful and savage chapter in the history of slavery and human oppression.

	The ruling class of racist America is the most hypocritical class in history. They captured Africans in Africa, enslaved them, stripped them of their culture, trampled on them, made them reproduce, completely dehumanized them, treated them like animals, and branded them with the mark of "black," thus praising the white man for inventing a new tool and instrument. The white man has always promoted this brutal slavery while claiming to be the creator of democratic and Christian society. The white man has always savagely and brutally exterminated the American Indians while piously thanking their white god for so generously giving them the fertile land and paradise of the Indians. They built a wall of imperialist brutality around the people of Latin America, piously calling it the protective Monroe Doctrine. They stretched their blood-stained hands to Asia, arrogantly calling it the "Open Door Policy."

	The Open Door Policy was once a policy used by armed bandits at the doorsteps of peaceful residents. Today, these bandits, under the name of "Christian democratic freedom of the world," trample and plunder the land of Vietnam, slaughtering unarmed women and children, slaughtering the people. These bandits massacred and starved to death a large number of American Indians on the land of the American Indians and now piously declare good deeds to India. They try to use this hypocrisy to use India to serve their activities of conquering and enslaving the peoples of Asia. What is the essence of the democracy of these bandits? Does such a savage, beastly, imperialist racist understand democracy? Shouldn't democracy, like charitable acts, begin at home and then expand abroad? What democracy is there for American blacks imprisoned in miserable ghettos and cotton fields in Mississippi, for American blacks savagely beaten by police with batons in Washington? What democracy is there for Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, and American Indians in racist America? Only the most naive person would believe the empty words and promises of such a morally bankrupt con artist.

	Hypocrites like Robert Kennedy represent deceitful American white supremacy. He is a slick salesman and a first-class con artist, strutting and preening in the cradle of white supremacy and colonialism in Africa, hugging and kissing black babies, dressing himself up as a great white father and savior of African blacks. Kennedy's actions in racist America are in stark contrast to his deceptive behavior in Africa. When Kennedy was the U.S. Attorney General, he swore to uphold the right of equal protection under the law, but he colluded with the most savage racists in America. He reached a "gentlemen's agreement" with the notorious racist governor of Mississippi, Ross Barnett. On the streets of racist America, unarmed and helpless black women and children are bombed, gassed, beaten, raped, and killed, but Kennedy has never punished a single white supremacist thug. As Attorney General, he turned a blind eye to the beating of Africans in the United States, even to the beating of diplomats stationed at the United Nations.

	Kennedy, on the one hand, proclaims his love for the black race in Africa, and on the other hand, joins the chorus of hatred, slander, and insult against American blacks, which is indeed a strange thing. This is the nature of deceitful and savage Americans.

	In the United States, Kennedy openly declares his opposition to black nationalism. According to his white supremacist logic, he turns it around and calls it racism. Black nationalism is a reaction to white nationalism, a struggle for survival. While white nationalism transcends religious, class, social, and political boundaries. The reason why there is no national, large-scale unity between blacks and whites today is that the white supremacist ruling class has poisoned the minds of white workers. Most white workers equate themselves with their white imperialist rulers. Enlightened whites insist on paternalism. Even those so-called socialists with bourgeois ideas are increasingly gathering on racial, rather than class, bases. We American black revolutionaries have found that some of those we originally thought were our comrades and class brothers, so-called socialists, have joined the international Ku Klux Klan to rule the world with white supremacy. We were shocked to discover that certain socialist countries, including a socialist country with both black and white people, have bourgeois tendencies in their government, preferring to see their natural national enemies, racist America, preserve the reactionary, anti-communist rule of the white race, rather than see a just, democratic, and brotherly socialist country established through the revolutionary actions of the oppressed blacks, which would best serve the interests of people of all races.

	They love to imitate their American counterparts, even competing with them in racism. Like the Americans, they are doing their utmost to sabotage the revolutionary movements of the oppressed peoples of the world.

	We who are engaged in the American black liberation movement strongly condemn and oppose all counter-revolutionaries and white supremacist peddlers, whether they are disguised in the cloak of Marxist-Leninist phrases or covered with the white robes and deceitful Christian doctrines of the Ku Klux Klan.

	We who strive for liberation and survival strongly condemn the use of dehumanized black troops as cannon fodder in the white imperialist war in Vietnam. We oppose Johnson's evil crusade to insult, slaughter, and enslave the great people of Vietnam.

	Black youth—from the black ghettos, poorly educated in segregated schools, and ravaged and humiliated by police brutality and the savage white power—yes, those black youth who cannot find jobs, who are victims of white racism, who are hated by white racists simply because of their skin color. Their mothers, sisters, and relatives are savagely beaten, gassed, raped, mutilated, and killed for merely pleading for the most basic justice, and are imprisoned in the lawless courts of racism with trumped-up charges—these black youth are forced to share the same trench with those who hate blacks, to shed blood with them in Vietnam, while those racists still refuse to treat them equally in the entertainment venues of Tokyo and Saigon, just as in racist America. A disproportionate number of black soldiers, compared to the so-called master race, are forced to suffer and die in this war, whose purpose is to prolong and expand the savage, racist white imperialism. They are forced to suffer and die in the deeds of the racist power that is the enemy of both American blacks and the peace-loving and freedom-loving people of Vietnam.

	Since many blacks are also fighting in Vietnam, why do we call the large-scale Ku Klux Klan-like actions in Vietnam a racist white imperialist war? This is because in racist America, there are no blacks in Johnson's decision-making group. The United States is ruled by a white government. The Pentagon is a cruel and merciless arm of the high-level white power structure, controlled by whites, a tool of oppression. Wall Street is the exclusive club of white business and industrial giants. American blacks are rebelling against this racist and imperialist all-white power structure. How can a nation struggling and sacrificing to seize the most basic human rights from a hard, tyrannical power structure be called a partner of that power structure, a willing participant in the racist and imperialist adventures and crimes of that power structure against humanity?

	Today's America is the most brutal fascist society in history. It has almost exterminated an entire nation. It has plundered and trampled an entire continent without punishment. It has divided the peoples of the world into various national factions, making them oppose each other and their brothers. It does not need more power; it only needs to wave its blood-stained imperialist claws to cancel the self-determination of small countries. It proclaims itself the king and knight of the entire universe, threatening to destroy the entire earth. It is a super-colonial power ruling over colonizers.

	The famous philosopher Bertrand Russell has pointed out with reason that the number of blacks killed by racist America is greater than the number of Jews killed by Hitler in Nazi Germany. Russell and many other just people in the world have said with reason that the military aggression of America in Vietnam is more brutal and savage than the evil aggression, genocide, and conquest of Hitler's fascist Germany.

	However, the cunning American devil has launched a powerful propaganda campaign to win more sympathy and goodwill for the so-called "good, wise Americans" than for those who suffer from the evil, cruel American imperialism. America is the greatest fascist threat in the world. When the Nazi German executioners were plundering, the world shouted: "Smash Nazism!" "Smash the fascist regime!" "Smash Germany!" A full-scale war was launched, and no protection was given to those who might be called the "good Germans." No sane person, no opponent of fascism, demanded a mild policy towards Nazi Germany or asked the victims to wait for the salvation of the "good German workers and enlightened people." When racist America dropped the terrible, destructive atomic bombs, it showed no mercy to the good people of Japan.

	The hypocritical liberalism of American liberals is merely a cloak and shield to protect the savage, racist American imperialism. What is the intention of those who exonerate American liberals? The so-called good, wise Americans must decide whether to openly collude with American chauvinism and aggression or take a firm anti-imperialist, anti-racist stance. This stance will be the solid foundation for lasting world peace and justice, and the time to make this decision is quickly approaching.

	We who suffer cruel oppression and persecution cannot always overlook these fortresses because of the so-called silent opposition within the fortresses of social reactionaries and tyrants. Those who, due to a lack of principles and beliefs, do not dare to publicly declare their support for the just cause of the oppressed must be prepared to face the impending storm of retribution. A good person who remains silent and does nothing in the face of serious injustice and oppression is not a good person at all. He is not an ally of freedom and justice but a silent partner of tyranny and oppression. He has no right to be exempt from the condemnation and hatred of those who suffer because of his silence. The so-called good, wise Americans are a myth, a hoax created by the psychological warfare machine of imperialist brutality. The end of racist America is at hand. The bloody and terrifying four hundred years have passed. For four hundred years, our good, silent partners have remained silent and taken no action. Time is running out, and they are still standing on the dividing line, begging for patience, begging slaves to entrust their fate to friends who have become lazy and silent. They represent the good people who have almost joined the enemy camp, asking blacks to follow the rules. We call on them to break with the devil. We tell them that they no longer have four hundred years to make their decision. Now is the last minute, now is the eve of the great battle between slave owners and slaves.

	Finally, let me once again express my gratitude to our great leader and teacher, the founder of people's war, Chairman Mao Zedong, for issuing the great, inspiring declaration supporting our struggle. We revolutionary American blacks swear to the great Chinese brothers and all true revolutionaries in the world: We will raise the torch of freedom and justice on the streets of racist America. We will ignite a blazing fire in the last bastion of American imperialism with the battle cry of "Black Power!" "Freedom! Freedom! Death rather than delay in obtaining freedom!" For the people of our country, for our nation and all our fellow human beings in the world, we will restore the noble spirit of the American Revolution. We will raise the banner of honor, true peace, and brotherhood to the world.

	Long live the People's Republic of China!
	Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!
	Long live the struggle of the people against imperialism, racism, and tyranny!
	Long live the fighting friendship between the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of America!

### 美国黑人领袖罗伯特·威廉的讲话

专栏：

    在首都各界人民反对美帝国主义、支持美国黑人反对种族歧视斗争大会上
    美国黑人领袖罗伯特·威廉的讲话各位兄弟、姐妹、爱国者、革命者：
    我要再一次感谢毛泽东主席和我们的兄弟，伟大的中国人民，感谢他们支持我们的斗争。值此纪念毛泽东主席为号召全世界人民联合起来反对美帝国主义的种族歧视，支持美国黑人反对种族歧视的斗争发表声明三周年之际，对美国黑人当前斗争发展的情况作一番分析和估价，是对毛泽东主席这个不朽的声明的正确性最好的称颂。
    毛泽东主席一九六三年八月八日的声明，对一个长期遭受残暴压迫和被剥夺人格的民族，对当时深受新甘地主义那种类似被虐狂的哲学所毒害的民族，给予了鼓舞。毛主席的话，推动了当时正在挣扎前进的一个微弱的武装自卫运动。今天，日益发展的武装抵抗的暴风正在横扫野蛮的帝国主义和兽性的种族主义的强大堡垒，全世界的一切反动派都为此而感到震惊和恐怖。在种族主义的美国的北部大城市，在小城镇，在农村，在南部黑暗的深林荒原，从东海岸到西海岸，被压迫和被剥夺人格的黑人正以革命的暴力来对付种族主义恐怖分子进行压迫的暴力。“黑人政权”的雷鸣之声在全国回荡。一个威力巨大的烈火的风暴席卷着充满暴动的黑人贫民窟。那些帝国主义暴君，在他们用盗窃来的财富所修建的天堂里，周围是他们制造可怕的杀人武器的大军火厂，而他们面临着瘦弱的愤怒的奴隶们以普通刀斧和汽油瓶为武器的斗争，感到惊恐万状，浑身发抖。
    在白人入侵者的暴权所统治的国土上——这些白人入侵者杀害并几乎灭绝了美国合法的主人印第安人——黑人政权这一口号意味着什么呢？黑人政权就是黑人要求掌握自己的生命，要求在与他们有关的公众事务上具有受到尊敬的发言权。我们反对做殖民地人民，在我们自己出生的土地上被当作第三等公民来看待。我们反对不许我们代表自己说话，甚至在我们占人口百分之八十五之多的黑人地带也没有发言权。我们反对在一个堕落的白人至上的社会里，把我们套在白人的模型里，变成畸形。这个社会嘲弄和贬低我们非洲人的文化遗产，并使我们对自己的民族特征感到羞耻。我们希望，通过黑人政权这个工具达到一个阶段，那时，我们将能以身为黑人而自豪，不需要因为长得不象盎格鲁撒克逊人而抱歉。在种族主义的美国，当前的社会是反动的、帝国主义的、种族主义的、腐朽的，我们要和它斩断联系。种族主义的白人政权机构正在罪恶地杀害越南人民，并用核毁灭威胁世界。黑人政权是和它挑战的一个反对力量。
    我们在这个新大陆上忍受白人种族主义之害已经四百年了。我们在现存的政府形式下忍受种族主义的暴行已将近二百年了。我们的人民在种族主义美国的大街上象猪一样被屠杀。我们的教堂和住所被炸毁。我们的妇女被强奸而暴徒却不受任何惩罚。我们的男子被阉割。我们被仇视、被杀害，只因为我们生下来就是黑人。由于我们拒绝赞美和热爱那些野蛮的压迫者，我们反而被称为种族主义者。
    我们是被压迫人民。我们的目标是打破我们的仇敌、我们的压迫者对我们施加的残酷的扼杀手段。一个反对者，如果没有勇气指出敌人的真实性质，就不可能与它对抗并击败它。我们提出，我们的敌人是什么就叫它什么。我们提出，要团结我们的人民，在这个基础上进行斗争。我们不打算为了和平共处而吞吞吐吐。一只腼腆的羊和一只狂暴的狼是不能在一起和平共处的，这是自然的规律。
    是的，在我们的斗争中，有一些美国白人是同我们站在一起的。他们是我们真正的兄弟。这些革命者理解我们的愤怒并同样感到愤怒。他们知道这是正当的愤怒。他们继承和发扬了反对奴隶制度的伟大和崇高的战士约翰·布朗的光荣精神。是的，他们也是在由约翰逊多数暴徒统治的、希特勒式弱肉强食的社会中被憎恨和受迫害的少数人。是的，和其他各国人民一样，在我们的队伍中也有敌人。我们中间有为了三十块银币就可以进行出卖的黑人叛徒。我们有黑人犹大，他们是为约翰逊政府及其种族主义白人政权效劳的愚蠢走狗。这些黑人傀儡和他们的白人主子一样，日子也不会很长了。
    我们对那些为白人压迫者充当走狗的黑人所怀的愤怒，同我们对白人至上主义压迫者的愤怒一样强烈。这些被雇用的汤姆大叔是今天在种族主义美国的风暴中心，最高声叫卖非暴力和平的人。有色人居住区在燃烧，但他们却鼓吹向继续存在的暴政和压迫低头屈服。
    约翰逊这位鼓吹民权的大人物，这位来自种族主义得克萨斯州的前参议员，在他当参议员的时候，对提交美国参议院的每一项民权法案都投了反对票。只要美国黑人消极地听任白人至上主义的暴徒和打手虐待和宰割，约翰逊就可以做现时代的美国黑人的救星摩西。但是，现在他拥有了残暴的白人至上的全国政权，就以此来对那些保卫他们自己，他们的房子，他们的妻子儿女的人进行威胁。约翰逊先生，这个白人至上主义者的大头子，常提醒我们的人民，说我们是少数，而残暴的种族主义野兽是多数。如同他的同路人三Ｋ党的成员一样，他企图以永远骑在我们头上的压迫者的多数来恐吓和威胁我们。正如他想以大量的核武器储存来威胁中国人民一样，约翰逊也企图用那些随时准备和愿意消灭我们民族的大量白人至上主义者来威胁美国黑人。我们要告诉约翰逊先生，威胁、暴力和残暴决扑灭不了人民解放斗争的熊熊烈火。世界上能够扑灭种族主义美国有色人居住区和大街上的烈火的唯一的力量，就是公平、兄弟关系、平等和正义。
    我们要警告来自得克萨斯州的大头子约翰逊，正如他不能够用发动核进攻来恐吓中国人民一样，他也不能够靠放出他的大群疯狗般的种族主义分子来恐吓美国黑人。野蛮的白人种族主义压迫者和帝国主义者可以用野蛮的暴力威胁来迫使有色人种屈服的日子，已经一去不复返了。
    我们革命的美国黑人用要求“黑人政权！”
  “立即自由！”“正义！”的呼声来回答约翰逊先生和他的白人至上主义的三Ｋ党。我们宣布：过人的生活，是我们不可剥夺的权利，我们要以血和火来实现我们的要求。是的，约翰逊先生，我们是少数，但我们是受压迫的少数，是决心以一切代价获得自由的少数，为了争取自由，我们决心尽一切努力，不惜付出任何代价，执行任何任务。
    是的，我们是少数，但我们是有力量的少数，因为我们的事业是正义的，正义在我们这一边。全世界战无不胜的反对帝国主义和反对种族主义的力量组成了伟大的浩浩荡荡的多种族的群众行列，我们是在这一行列中前进的少数。约翰逊先生既然对人数如此重视，为了他的好处，我们要以一位伟大的人民领袖的话再次提醒他。这位伟大的人民领袖是人类的解放者，他的言语、思想和教导，如同屹立在直布罗陀海峡狂风巨浪中的雄伟岩石一样，坚不可侵。是的，我们再一次提醒他，我们伟大的领袖和导师毛泽东主席曾经说过：
    “……他们是少数，我们是多数。全世界三十亿人口中，他们最多也不到百分之十。我深信，在全世界百分之九十以上的人民的支持下，美国黑人的正义斗争是一定要胜利的。万恶的殖民主义、帝国主义制度是随着奴役和贩卖黑人而兴盛起来的，它也必将随着黑色人种的彻底解放而告终。”
    今天在种族主义美国的弱肉强食社会中，街上的普通野狗的权利，比有色人种的权利还要多。享有“基督”民主的所谓自由世界的法律及其不讲法律的法庭，对街上的普通野狗和其他不会说话的动物的权利进行保护，但是没有一个法庭对有色的美国人讲公平正义，保障公正无偏的宪法权利与人权。在野蛮的美国的整个历史中，我们黑人长期遭受的牛马不如的悲惨命运，构成了奴隶制度史和人虐待人的历史中最可耻、最野蛮的篇章。
    种族主义美国的统治阶级是世界有史以来一个最伪善的阶级。它在非洲俘获来了非洲人，奴役了他们，剥夺了他们的文化，蹂躏了他们，让他们增生繁殖，使他们完全丧失人格，把他们当作畜牲，还给他们打上“黑人”的印记，以此来赞扬白人发明创造了一种新农具和新工具。白人始终是在促进这种残暴的奴役，同时却宣称自己是民主和基督教社会的创建者。白人始终在残暴而野蛮地灭绝美洲印第安人，同时却虔诚地向他们的白种上帝表示感恩，感激上帝如此慷慨地把印第安人的肥沃土地和天堂赐与他们。他们围绕着拉丁美洲人民修起了一堵横暴的帝国主义监狱的大墙，却虔诚地把它称之为保护性的门罗主义。他们把血手伸到亚洲，狂妄地称之为“门户开放政策”。
    门户开放政策过去是武装匪徒在和平居民的门口使用的政策。今天，这些匪徒，以“自由世界基督教民主”的名义，蹂躏和掠夺越南的国土，屠杀手无寸铁的妇女和儿童，屠杀人民。
    这些匪徒在美洲印第安人的土地上大量杀害和饿死了美洲印第安人，现在居然虔诚地宣告向印度大兴善举，他们企图通过这种伪善的作法，利用印度为他们征服和奴役亚洲各国人民的活动服务。这些匪徒的民主的本质是什么呢？难道这样一个野蛮的兽性的、帝国主义的种族主义者懂得什么民主吗？难道民主不应该象慈善行为一样，先从国内开始，然后才扩大到国外吗？在悲惨的贫民窟和密西西比州棉田里被监禁的美国黑人，在华盛顿被野蛮的警察用警棍拷打的美国黑人，有什么民主可言呢？在种族主义的美国，波多黎各人、墨西哥人和美洲印第安人，又有什么民主可言呢？只有最天真的人才会去相信这样一个道德败坏的江湖骗子的空话和诺言。
    罗伯特·肯尼迪之流的伪善者代表着骗人的美国白人至上主义。他是一个滑头的商贩和头等的江湖大骗子，在非洲白人至上和殖民主义的温床地区大摇大摆，神气活现，对黑人婴儿又是拥抱又是亲吻，把自己打扮成为一个伟大的白人父亲和非洲黑人的救星。肯尼迪先生在种族主义美国的种种行动，同他在非洲的骗人行为是一个鲜明的对比。肯尼迪先生担任美国司法部长的时候，曾经宣誓要维护在法制下人们受到平等保护的权利，但是，他却和美国最野蛮的种族主义者互相勾结。他和臭名昭彰的密西西比州种族主义州长罗斯·巴纳特达成了
  “白人的君子协定”。在种族主义美国的大街上，手无寸铁和无援无助的黑人妇女和儿童被炸，被毒气熏，被棍打，被强奸和杀害，肯尼迪先生却连一个白人至上主义暴徒都没有惩罚过。身为司法部长，他对于在美国的非洲人，甚至对于被派驻联合国的外交官遭到殴打，都置若罔闻。
    肯尼迪先生一方面标榜自己对非洲的黑色人种如何热爱，一方面又参加对美国黑人高呼仇恨、诽谤和侮辱的口号的大合唱，这实在是咄咄怪事。这就是骗人而又野蛮的美国佬的本性。
    在美国，肯尼迪先生公开宣称他反对黑人民族主义。他按照他的白人至上的逻辑，倒过来称之为种族主义。黑人民族主义是为对付白人民族主义、谋求生存的一种反应。而白人民族主义是超越宗教、阶级、社会和政治界限的。今天之所以不存在全国性的、大规模的黑人和白人的团结，是由于白人至上的统治阶级毒害了白种工人的思想。大多数白种工人都把自己同他们的白色帝国主义统治者等同起来。白种的开明人士则坚持恩赐主义。甚至那些抱着资产阶级思想的所谓社会主义者，都越来越在种族的、而不是阶级的基础上聚集起来。我们美国黑人革命者发现，有些我们原来以为是我们的同志和阶级兄弟的所谓社会主义者，参加了争取以白人至上来统治世界的国际三Ｋ党。我们惊楞地发现，某些社会主义国家，其中包括一个黑人白人都有的社会主义国家具有资产阶级倾向的政权，宁愿看到他们当然的民族敌人，即种族主义的美国，保存白种人的反动、反共政权，而不愿看到通过被压迫的黑人的革命行动来建立一个能够最好地为各种族人民的利益服务的公正、民主、兄弟的社会主义国家。
    他们非常喜欢模仿他们的美国对手，甚至到了在种族主义方面都同它竞赛的地步。同美国佬一样，他们正全力以赴地企图挫败全世界被压迫人民的革命运动。
    我们从事美国黑人解放运动的人们，坚决谴责和反对一切反革命分子和白人至上主义兜售者，不论他们是用马列主义词句的外衣，还是用三Ｋ党的白布和欺人的基督教义来掩盖他们的罪行。
    我们争取解放与生存的人们，强烈谴责在越南的白人帝国主义战争中，用被剥夺人格的黑人部队充当炮灰。我们反对约翰逊用来侮辱、宰割和奴役伟大的越南人民的罪恶十字军。
    黑人青年——从黑人区贫民窟来的，在种族隔离学校里受了坏教育的，为警察的暴行与野蛮的白人政权所摧残和屈辱的黑人青年——是的，那些找不到工作的黑人青年，他们是白人种族主义的受害者，白人种族主义者就因为他们的肤色而仇视他们。他们的母亲、姊妹和亲人只是由于乞求最基本的正义而受到野蛮的殴打、毒气弹的进攻、强奸、断肢、杀害，并在种族主义的不讲法律的法庭上被加以莫须有的罪名而投入监狱，——这些黑人青年被迫与那些仇视黑人的种族主义者蹲在同一个战壕里，同他们一起在越南流血，而那些种族主义者仍象在种族主义的美国一样，在东京和西贡的娱乐场所拒绝同他们平等相待。数量上与自称为主子种族的比例不相称的大批黑人士兵，被迫在这场战争中受折磨和死亡，而这场战争的目的是妄图延长和扩大野蛮的、种族主义的白人帝国主义。他们被迫在种族主义政权所从事的勾当中受折磨和死去，这个种族主义政权既是美国黑人的敌人，同样也是爱好和平与自由的越南人民的敌人。
    既然有许多黑人也在越南作战，为什么我们把在越南的大规模三Ｋ党式的行动，称之为一场种族主义的白人帝国主义的战争呢？这是因为在种族主义的美国，约翰逊的决策集团里是没有黑人的。美国是由白人政权统治的。五角大楼是高级白人的残酷无情的政权机构中，由白人控制的一只专事镇压的手臂，华尔街是白人商业和工业巨头们的独占的俱乐部。美国黑人正在反抗着这一种族主义和帝国主义的纯白人政权机构。怎么能把一个正在为从死硬的、暴虐的政权机构手中夺取最基本人权而斗争、而牺牲的民族说成是那个政权机构的合伙者，说成是自愿参加这个政权机构对人类犯下种族主义和帝国主义冒险和罪行的人呢？
    今天的美国是世界上历来最残酷的法西斯社会。它几乎消灭了一整个民族。它掠夺与蹂躏了一整个大陆，而未受到惩罚。它把世界的人民分成各民族派别，使他们互相对立，并和他们的兄弟对抗。它不用更多的权力，只要挥动它那沾满鲜血的帝国主义魔爪，就取消了小国的自决权。它自封为整个宇宙的国王和骑士，它威胁要毁灭整个地球。它是一个驾驭在殖民者之上的超级殖民政权。
    世界闻名的杰出的哲学家罗素勋爵曾有根据地指出，种族主义美国所杀害的黑人，比希特勒在纳粹德国所杀害的犹太人还要多。罗素勋爵和世界上其他许多公正人士都很有根据地说过，美国在越南的军事侵略，要比希特勒的法西斯德国所进行的罪恶的侵略、种族灭绝和征服更残酷、更野蛮。
    可是，阴险的美国魔鬼自己发动了一个强大的宣传运动，争取对所谓的“善良、明智的美国人”，比对受万恶的残忍的美帝国主义之害的人，给予更多的同情和好感。美国是世界上最大的法西斯威胁。当纳粹德国的刽子手进行掠夺的时候，全世界高呼：“粉碎纳粹！”“粉碎法西斯政权！”“粉碎德国！”一场全面的战争发动起来了，并没有给纳粹德国的那些可能被称为
  “善良的德国人”任何保护。没有任何头脑清醒的人，反对法西斯的人，要求对纳粹德国采取温和政策，或要求受害者等待“善良的德国工人和开明人士”的解救。种族主义的美国在投掷可怕的、毁灭性的原子弹时，对善良的日本人民并没有发丝毫慈悲。
    美国自由派的虚伪的自由主义只不过是一件用来保护野蛮的种族主义的美帝国主义的外衣和盾牌。那些为美国自由派开脱罪责的人居心何在呢？所谓善良的、明智的美国人不得不决定，要么公开与美国沙文主义和侵略主义同流合污，要么采取坚决反帝、反种族主义的立场，这种立场将是正义的和持久的世界和平的牢固基础，需要作出这一决定的时刻很快就要到来了。
    我们遭受残酷压迫和迫害的人，不能总是因为社会反动派和暴君的堡垒里面有所谓的沉默的反对派，而放过这些堡垒。那些由于没有原则和信念而不肯公开宣布站在受压迫者的正义事业的一边的人必须准备承受即将来到的狂风暴雨般的报应。一个善良的人如果在严重的不公正和压迫行为面前保持沉默，无所作为，那他根本就不是善良的人。他不是自由和正义的同盟者，而是暴虐和压迫的沉默的伙伴。他没有资格免除那些由于他的沉默而受害的人的谴责和仇恨。所谓善良、明智的美国人，是一个神话，这种人尚未发现，这只是帝国主义残暴势力的心理作战机构制造的骗局。现在已经到了种族主义美国末日的前夕了。血腥而恐怖的四百年已经过去了。四百年来，我们善良的沉默的伙伴一直保持沉默，不采取任何行动。时间已快到头了，而他们却站在分界线上，依然恳求忍耐，恳求奴隶把命运交给那些得了惰性病的沉默不言的朋友们。他们代表那些几乎已经站到敌人阵营那一面的善良的人们要求黑人循规蹈矩。我们号召他们和魔鬼分家。我们告诉他们，他们不再有四百年的时间来作出决定了。现在已是最后一分钟了，现在已是奴隶主和奴隶之间大决战的前夕了。
    最后，让我再一次对我们伟大的领袖和导师、人民战争的创始人毛泽东主席表示感谢，感谢他发表了支持我们斗争的伟大的、鼓舞人心的声明。我们革命的美国黑人向伟大的中国兄弟们和全世界真正的革命者宣誓：我们要在种族主义的美国的大街上举起自由和正义的火炬，我们要以“黑人政权！”“自由！自由！不立即得到自由毋宁死亡！”的战斗口号，在美帝国主义最后一个堡垒里点起熊熊烈火。为了我国人民，为了我们的国家和全世界的同胞们，我们要恢复美国革命的崇高精神，我们要向全世界举起荣誉、真正的和平和兄弟情谊的旗帜。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    毛泽东主席万岁！
    人民反抗帝国主义、种族主义和暴政的斗争万岁！
    中国人民和革命的美国人民之间的战斗友谊万岁！
