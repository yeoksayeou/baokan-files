Editor's Note: The anti-party, anti-socialist clique led by Lu Ping has committed heinous crimes at Peking University. They stubbornly carried out the revisionist line, fiercely opposed Mao Zedong Thought, and the party's educational policies, and tried to cultivate young students into successors of the bourgeoisie. The revolutionary students, teachers, and staff of Peking University, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, used big-character posters and debates to speak out, expose, and criticize, breaking through various obstacles to launch an attack on the Lu Ping gang. The following are a few big-character posters selected from the vast sea of posters at Peking University. From these, we can see how the Lu Ping gang implemented bourgeois dictatorship at Peking University, how they fiercely opposed Mao Zedong Thought and the party's educational policies, how they excluded and suppressed the children of workers and peasants, and how they elevated the bourgeois academic "authorities" to the heavens. Lu Ping's crimes must be thoroughly settled. Under the guidance of the decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution made by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao, the revolutionary students, teachers, and staff of Peking University will surely be able to overthrow, smash, and expose the anti-party element Lu Ping, and build Peking University into a new type of socialist university.

In the first half of 1964, the Lu Ping gang held two academic conferences, which were important steps in their malicious distortion of the party's educational policies, resistance to Mao Zedong Thought, and stubborn promotion of the revisionist educational line.

First Academic Conference

At the end of 1963, the Party Central Committee pointed out that the task and direction of philosophy and social sciences should be to oppose revisionism. The Lu Ping gang was extremely hostile to the policy of opposing revisionism and was very fearful of the revolutionary actions of the masses, doing everything possible to resist it. It was under these circumstances that the first academic conference was held in February 1964. In the report, Lu Ping boasted extensively about the school's "achievements" over the past few years.

This report was compiled under Lu Ping's direct command. This "strange document" used every trick of the two-faced tactic, talking about "opposing modern revisionism as the key," "relearning Mao Zedong Thought," "strengthening the study of current conditions and theory," and so on. It sounded grand and moving, but in practice, it was directed against Mao Zedong Thought and strived to suppress the revolutionary spirit of opposing revisionism.

1. As soon as the conference ended, each department had to determine the key directions for scientific research. Under the manipulation of the Lu Ping gang, the key direction for scientific research in the Chinese Department was set as "Chinese Literary History," the key direction for the Philosophy Department was "Chinese Philosophical History," and the key direction for the History Department was "Ancient Chinese History." In this way, the direction of scientific research in the liberal arts stubbornly adhered to the old path of "big, foreign, and ancient."

2. The Lu Ping gang organized the writing of "anti-revisionist" articles, with the titles and leading figures of each article being forcibly prescribed by him. One was a theoretical article, with Feng Ding (a notorious revisionist) and Zhao Baohui (a member of the Lu Ping gang and head of the International Politics Department) as the leaders; another was a historical article, with Jian Bozhan (an anti-communist veteran) as the leader. Later, the "San Jia Village" gang members who controlled the editorial department of "Frontline" sent their henchmen to "specifically coordinate" the writing of these articles, causing chaos and a stench that was unbearable.

3. The Lu Ping gang also released a smokescreen at the meeting, saying they would establish several "research institutes" to strengthen the study of current conditions and theory, intending to use these institutes as tools to place their gang members, gain political capital, and as a base to further promote the revisionist line and oppose Mao Zedong Thought.

Second Academic Conference

This conference was held in May 1964, with the banner of "few but excellent." At the meeting, the Lu Ping gang put forward eight so-called "experiences," hiding an unspeakable conspiracy.

1. Opposing Mao Zedong Thought and resisting the principle of "few but excellent."

Peking University is a stronghold of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionist thought. To truly implement Mao Zedong Thought, it is necessary to launch a fierce class struggle, to break down the old and establish the new, with the emphasis on breaking down. However, the Lu Ping gang turned this around, using the method of "summarizing experiences" to resist Chairman Mao's educational thoughts. Lu Ping claimed to use "affirming achievements" to "make up for shortcomings." At the departmental discussions, they also stipulated that "only achievements can be discussed at the meeting" and "criticism and suggestions are not allowed," effectively preventing the revolutionary teachers and students from exposing and criticizing the old educational system and educational thoughts, and suppressing the revolutionary actions of the masses. The Lu Ping gang blew a cold wind, and the goods of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism were dug out and displayed, all praised as "experiences." For example, the bourgeois "academic tyrant" Wang Li's "History of Chinese Linguistics" was said to have summarized the "experience" of the development of Chinese linguistics. Some bourgeois "scholars" and "ancestors" said that their lectures had always been "few but excellent," in line with Chairman Mao's thoughts... and so on, truly mixing up right and wrong. The capitalist-roaders within the party and the bourgeois "scholars" and "authorities" outside the party colluded with each other, making the entire academic conference full of poison and evil spirits.

2. Faking and beautifying bourgeois "professors" and "experts."

What were the contents of the "experience reports" presented at the meeting? Who were the authors of these "reports"? There is no need to list them one by one. Let's just take one "report" from the Department of Western Languages as an example: "Preliminary Attempt to Implement the Principle of 'Few but Excellent' in English Grammar Teaching." The author himself did not study Chairman Mao's works, but the "report" talked about the thoughts and feelings of studying Chairman Mao's works. On the left, it was about learning from "Moving Mountains" to overcome conservatism and stagnation, and on the right, it was about responding to the call of President Lu Ping to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought... These were all fabricated "masterpieces."

The other "reports" at the meeting were also falsified, exaggerated, and even fabricated out of thin air. For example, the teaching "experience" of a certain "associate professor" in the Political Department was originally worthless, but the henchmen of Lu Ping said: "We should treat a dead horse as a living one," after a round of "processing," it was finally brought out.

In summary, this conference was a big conspiracy and deception by the Lu Ping gang, using the banner of implementing "few but excellent" to oppose Mao Zedong Thought and deceive those above and below!

　　撕破陆平召开两次文科会议的黑幕
    编者按：反党反社会主义的陆平一伙在北京大学犯下了滔天罪行。他们顽固地执行修正主义路线，疯狂地反对毛泽东思想、反对党的教育方针，竭力要把青年学生培养成资产阶级的接班人。北京大学广大革命学生和革命教师职工，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，用大字报、大辩论的形式，大鸣大放，大揭露，大批判，冲破种种阻力，向陆平黑帮举行了进攻。这里发表的只是从北京大学的大字报海洋中选出的几张大字报。从这里我们可以看出：陆平黑帮在北京大学是怎样地实行了资产阶级专政，怎样猖狂地反对毛泽东思想、反对党的教育方针，怎样排斥打击工农子弟，怎样把资产阶级的学术“权威”捧上了天。陆平的罪行必须彻底清算。北京大学广大革命学生和革命教师职工，在毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定的指引下，一定能够把反党分子陆平斗倒，斗垮，斗臭，一定能把北京大学建设成为社会主义的新型的大学。
    一九六四年上半年，陆平黑帮曾先后召开了两次文科会议，这两次会议是陆平黑帮恶意篡改党的教育方针，抵制毛泽东思想，顽固地推行修正主义教育路线的重要步骤。
    第一次文科会议
    一九六三年底党中央指出，哲学社会科学的任务与方向要以反修为纲。陆平黑帮对以反修为纲的方针极端仇视，对群众革命行动非常畏惧，千方百计予以抵制。就在这种情况下，于一九六四年二月召开了第一次文科会议。在报告中，陆平大肆吹嘘学校几年来工作的“成绩”。
    这篇报告是在陆平直接指挥下编造出来的。这篇“奇文”耍尽两面派的手法，什么“以反对现代修正主义为纲”、“重新学习毛泽东思想”啦！什么“要大力加强现状、理论研究”啦！……说得冠冕堂皇、娓娓动听，而实际做时，矛头却针对着毛泽东思想，极力扼杀反修为纲的革命精神。
      （一）会议刚一结束，各系要确定科学研究的重点方向。在陆平黑帮的操纵下，即确定中文系的科学研究重点是“中国文学史”，哲学系的重点是“中国哲学史”，历史系重点是“中国古代史”。就这样，文科的科学研究方向仍然顽固地坚持“大、洋、古”的老路。
      （二）陆平黑帮组织写的“反修”文章，题目和每篇文章的挂帅人物都是他强行规定的。一篇是理论方面的，由冯定（臭名远扬的修正主义分子）、赵宝煦（陆平黑帮，国际政治系主任）挂帅；另一篇史学方面的文章由翦伯赞（反共老手）挂帅。后来“三家村”黑帮分子邓拓操纵的《前线》编辑部，又派出爪牙来“具体联系”这几篇文章的写作工作，上下齐动手，弄得乌烟瘴气，臭不可闻。
      （三）陆平黑帮在会上又放出要成立几个“研究所”，加强对现状和理论的研究的烟幕，想把这些研究所作为安插黑帮爪牙，捞取政治资本的工具，作为进一步推行修正主义路线，反对毛泽东思想的阵地。
    第二次文科会议
    这次会议于一九六四年五月召开，挂出的招牌是“贯彻少而精”。会上陆平黑帮抛出了八篇所谓“经验”。这里有不可告人的阴谋。
    （一）反对毛泽东思想，抵制“少而精”的原则。
    北京大学是封建主义、资本主义、修正主义思想的顽固堡垒。要真正贯彻毛泽东思想就必然要开展一场剧烈的阶级斗争，必须大破大立，破字当头，立在其中。可是陆平黑帮却掉过头来用“总结经验”的手段以抵制毛主席教育思想。陆平扬言要以“肯定成绩”来“弥补缺点”。在各系的讨论会上，他们又规定“会上只能谈成绩”，“不许批评、提意见”，实际上不许广大革命师生向旧教育制度、教育思想揭发批判，扼杀群众的革命行动。陆平黑帮吹起了阴风，封建主义的、资本主义的、修正主义的货色，翻箱倒柜，纷纷出笼，而且一律誉为“经验”。例如，资产阶级“学阀”王力等人写的《中国语言学史》，被称为是总结了中国语言学发展的“经验”。还有些资产阶级“学者”、“祖师爷”说他们讲课“一贯就是少而精，与毛主席思想暗合”……如此等等，真是鱼目混珠，是非颠倒。党内走资本主义道路的当权派与党外资产阶级“学者”、“权威”里应外合，狼狈为奸，使整个文科会议毒素横流，妖气弥漫。
    （二）弄虚作假，美化资产阶级“教授”、“专家”。
    会上提出的“经验报告”，内容是些什么货色？“报告”的作者又是些什么人物？这里不准备一一列举，仅以西语系的一篇“报告”来说：《在英语语法教学中贯彻“少而精”原则的初步尝试》，作者本人根本不学毛主席著作，可是“报告”里却大谈学习毛主席著作的思想体会。左一个学习《愚公移山》克服因循守旧、故步自封啦，右一个响应陆平校长号召活学活用毛泽东思想啦……。这些都是加工捏造的“杰作”。
    会上的其他“报告”，也都是掺假抬高、甚至是凭空捏造的。如政治系某“副教授”的讲课“经验”，本来毫无可取之处，但陆平爪牙说：“要把死马当作活马医”，经过一番“加工”，最后也居然拿出来了。
    总之，这次会议是陆平黑帮打着贯彻“少而精”的红旗，反对毛泽东思想，欺上瞒下的大阴谋、大骗局！
