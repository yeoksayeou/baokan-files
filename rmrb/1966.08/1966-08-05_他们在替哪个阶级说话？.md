Title: Who Are They Speaking For?

The film "Two Families" has utterly defamed us poor and lower-middle peasants. There isn't a single person among us like Gao Zhengguo, who pursues wealth, doesn't sell surplus grain to the state, doesn't join the cooperative, and wants to seize others' land and harm class brothers. Only the landlords and rich farmers in our county who have been overthrown, like Zhao Youyu and Guo Yuhuan, would have such ideas. If this film were about landlords and bureaucrats, that would be fine; but they put all those evil schemes on the heads of poor peasants, especially those who suffered greatly before liberation and fought against landlords during the land reform. This is unacceptable.

"The Two Families" portrays us poor peasants as opposing the Party's policies and directives, which is a blatant lie! When it comes to establishing cooperatives and taking the path of collectivization, Chairman Mao has shown us the bright path. We poor peasants have always been at the forefront. By the end of 1952, after we established our cooperative, the community lacked wheat seeds, and every family contributed their own wheat. At that time, many poor peasants wanted to join the cooperative. Our cooperative expanded every year, and by the time of the agricultural collectivization movement in 1955, the village set up five or six tables for sign-ups, and we were still busy. But how does the film portray it? Gao Zhengguo walks down the street and, upon hearing about the cooperative, is so anxious that he knocks over street stalls. He returns home and lies in bed, refusing to get up. To say that we poor peasants oppose the cooperative is a complete fabrication.

This film also distorts the class struggle in the countryside. Throughout the film, we don't see any landlords or rich peasants causing trouble, nor do we see any well-off middle peasants resisting. From beginning to end, it's all about Gao Zhengguo being unable to understand, sometimes looking fierce, sometimes looking gloomy, always with a worried frown. We must ask: What class position do the authors of this film stand on? Whose class are they speaking for? Whose class are they praising, and whose class are they attacking?

I believe the film's attack is not on one or two individuals but on millions of people, on all of us laboring people, on our great Party. The enemies with guns are easy to spot; the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements in the countryside are easy to see. But those enemies with pens who write bad books, bad plays, and bad films are not easy to spot. We must actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, heighten our vigilance, sharpen our eyes, and fight to the end against that handful of enemies with pens.

    他们在替哪个阶级说话？
    云南晋宁县晋城人民公社小寨大队第七生产队队长  袁学礼
    电影《两家人》把我们贫下中农简直污蔑得太不成样子了。象高正国那样追求发家致富，不卖余粮给国家，不参加合作社，还想并吞人家的土地，坑害阶级兄弟的人，在我们贫下中农里，根本找不出一个。高正国的有些想法，比如搞个人“五年计划”，办“大农庄”等等发家致富的主意，只有我们县里被打倒的大恶霸地主赵有余、郭玉鸾才会有。我说这部电影讲的要是地主官僚，那就合了；可是他们偏偏把那些恶毒的算盘都弄到我们贫农的头上，而且是弄到解放前受苦很深、土改中又首先起来斗争地主的贫农头上，这是不能容许的。
    《两家人》把我们贫农说成对党的政策方针那么抵触，完全是睁着眼说瞎话！说到办合作社，走集体化道路，这是毛主席给我们农民指出的光明大道，我们贫农从来是积极带头的。一九五二年底，我们办起社后，社里缺麦种，我们家家都把自己的麦子拿出来。那时候，要求入社的贫农，很多很多。我们的社年年都在扩大，到一九五五年农业合作化高潮时，村里放了五六张桌子挂名字，还忙不过来。但是电影上是怎样演的呢？高正国在街上走，一听见要办社，紧张得把街上的小摊子都撞倒了，一回到家就躺在床上不起来。说我们贫农对办社那么抵触，是彻头彻尾的捏造。
    这部影片还歪曲了农村的阶级斗争。我们在影片里从头到尾看不到哪个地主富农捣蛋，也看不到哪个富裕中农抵触。从头到尾，都是高正国想不通，一会儿恶相，一会儿霉相，愁眉苦脸的。我们要问：这部影片的作者究竟站在什么阶级立场上？他们在替哪个阶级说话？表扬哪个阶级，打击哪个阶级？
    我看电影攻击的不是一两个人，而是千百万人，是我们所有劳动人民，是我们伟大的党。拿枪杆的敌人，一望就见，农村中的地富反坏，一抬眼就看得清；那些专写坏书、坏戏、坏电影的拿笔杆的敌人却不容易看清。我们一定要活学活用毛主席著作，提高警惕，擦亮眼睛，同那一小撮拿笔杆的敌人斗争到底。
