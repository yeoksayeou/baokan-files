In 1958, the Party Central Committee proposed the educational policy of "serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor." Under these circumstances, Peking University reluctantly admitted a batch of worker-peasant cadre students and a batch of students of worker-peasant origin.

The worker-peasant students had boundless love for the Party and Chairman Mao. The Uu Ping clique saw the worker-peasant students as thorns in their eyes and flesh in their bones. They openly declared, "To accommodate worker-peasant students, the overall level has been lowered. In name, it is the class line, but in reality, it is not beneficial to the country." The Uu Ping clique insulted worker-peasant students as "bad timber that cannot be carved into fine work," as "idiots" and "lazybones." They even said, "Cultivating a hundred half-baked ones is not as good as cultivating one complete one." The head of the Physics Department even openly declared, "Whether or not to admit children of workers and peasants is irrelevant. We can develop our own Party members and cultivate our own cadres." Over the years, the Uu Ping clique has treated worker-peasant students as "rejects" and gradually eliminated them.

The Uu Ping clique used every possible means to harass, exclude, and suppress worker-peasant students. A student in the Physics Department who had failed two courses and scored 63 in the last one was told by the department head, "63 is not a passing score; the standard has been raised to 65." This student was thus retained because he had failed three courses. Sometimes, when worker-peasant students answered teachers' questions in class, the teachers would say that the answer did not count and then pose a more difficult question. Comrade Duan Xinzi, a member of the Communist Party from a poor peasant background, who had fought in the Battle of Triangle Hill and been wounded, had difficulties in his studies and was often ridiculed. When his experiments were relatively good, his data was doubted. Later, the Uu Ping clique found an excuse to expel him from the school without any arrangement. There are countless similar cases.

The Uu Ping clique regarded worker-peasant students as enemies and hated them to the core. However, they treated the sons and daughters of the bourgeoisie as treasures, nurturing them with great care; they shielded counter-revolutionaries and traitors with every possible means.

In 1962, the school readmitted many rightists and allowed them to continue their studies. The Physics Department had a rightist from a landlord background in the class of 1955, whose reactionary thoughts were extremely stubborn. The Uu Ping clique readmitted him and gave him the highest level of scholarship, 19.5 yuan, nurturing him with great care. In the same year, they expelled a large number of worker-peasant students in the name of "improving quality" and "maintaining a certain rate of elimination."

To expel worker-peasant students from Peking University as soon as possible, the Uu Ping clique carried out a series of criminal activities. First, at a meeting of the deans, Uu Ping proposed a plan to change the curriculum for the 1958 class of worker-peasant students to a five-year system. He then wrote a report to the Ministry of Higher Education, falsely claiming that worker-peasant students hoped to change to a five-year system, saying that this group of students was older, had greater difficulties in their studies, and had poor foundations. Later, through large and small meetings, individual talks, and deception, the various departments excluded worker-peasant students. They ordered Party members to lead the way in choosing the five-year system, and those who did not choose were labeled as "individualists" and threatened that even if they graduated after six years, they would not be issued a diploma. Worker-peasant students were driven to a dead end. Su Da Ren, a student from a poor peasant background in the class of 1960, who had always performed well, was forced by the secretary of the departmental Party branch to choose the five-year system, saying, "If we do not order you to drop out, it would be a favor." He also said, "The path is clear, one is five years, and one is seven years (retained), where to go and where not to go, you choose yourself." Su Da Ren did not want to choose the five-year system, and as a result, he was retained.

In this way, a large number of worker-peasant students were retained, expelled, or forced to choose the five-year system. In the Physics Department, out of 48 students of worker-peasant origin in the class of 1958, 10 could not stay, 5 were retained, 25 were forced to choose the five-year system, and only 8 chose the six-year system. In the Biology Department, out of more than 50 worker-peasant students, 22 chose the five-year system, 7 chose the six-year system, and more than 20 were retained or expelled. Worker-peasant students in other classes suffered the same persecution. In the Physics Department, out of 209 students in the class of 1960, 52 left the class in six years, including 31 worker-peasant students; out of 52, 10 worker-peasant students were expelled from the school; out of 8 worker-peasant cadre students, 7 were expelled.

See! The Uu Ping clique hated worker-peasant students to the core.

### 看，陆平怎样打击工农同学

　　看，陆平怎样打击工农同学
    一九五八年，党中央提出了“教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动结合”的教育方针以后，北大在无可奈何的情况下，招收了一批工农调干学生和一批工农出身的学生。
    工农学生对党和毛主席无比热爱。陆平黑帮就把工农学生看成是眼中钉、肉中刺。他们公开叫嚣：“为了照顾工农同学，拉低了大家的水平，名义上是阶级路线，实际上对国家不利。”陆平黑帮污辱工农学生是“坏木头雕不出好花来”，是“笨蛋”、“懒汉”。还说什么“培养一百个半拉的，顶不上一个完整的。”物理系主任竟然公开叫嚣：“招不招工农子弟没关系，没有党员我们自己发展，没有干部我们自己培养。”几年来，陆平黑帮就是这样把工农同学当作“处理品”陆续处理掉。
    陆平黑帮百般刁难、排挤、打击工农学生。物理系一位已有两门功课不及格的同学，最后一门考了六十三分。系主任却说：“六十三分不算及格，标准提高，六十五分才及格。”这位同学就这样刚好凑满三门不及格而留级了。有时工农同学在课堂上回答了老师的问题，老师却说，这个问题不算数，又重新出难题。共产党员段心齐同学，贫农出身，上甘岭战斗中立过功、受过伤，学习有困难，经常受到冷嘲热讽，有时实验做得比较好，数据却受人怀疑。后来陆平黑帮找借口，硬把他推出学校，不给任何安排。类似以上情况，说也说不完。
    陆平黑帮对工农同学视如仇敌、恨之入骨。而对资产阶级的少爷、小姐，则视若宝珠，精心培养；对反革命分子、叛徒，则千方百计地包庇。
    一九六二年学校把许多右派分子调了回来，让他们继续学习。数力系五五级有一个右派分子，地主出身，反动思想极其顽固，陆平黑帮把他调了回来，并发给最高等级助学金十九元五角，加以精心培养。就在这一年，却以“提高质量”，“一定的淘汰率是需要的”为名，把大批工农同学赶出校门。
    陆平黑帮为了早日把工农同学推出北大，搞了一系列的罪恶活动。首先他在教务长例会上提出把五八级工农同学改为五年制的方案。他又给高教部写了报告，捏造说：工农同学希望能改为五年制，还说这部分学生年龄大，学习上困难大，基础差。以后，各系通过大会小会动员、个别谈话和诱骗等方式，对工农同学进行排斥。他们命令党员带头选五年制，谁不选就给扣上“个人主义”的帽子，并威胁说，念六年毕业了也不发给文凭。工农同学被逼得走投无路。四级刨工出身的粟达人同学，一贯表现很好。系总支书记硬要他念五年制，说：“不勒令你退学就照顾了”；又说：“路已指明，一个五年，一个七年（留级），何去何从，你自己选择。”粟达人不愿意念五年制，结果就把他留级了。
    就这样，大批工农同学，留级的留级，退学的退学。数力系五八级工农出身的同学四十八人，呆不下去的十人，留级的五人，被迫学五年制的二十五人，只有八名学六年制。生物系五十多位工农同学学五年制的二十二名，六年制的只有七名，其余二十多名留级的留级，退学的退学。其他各届的工农同学都遭到同样的迫害。物理系六○级总招生二○九人，六年来五十二人离开这个年级，其中有三十一人是工农同学；五十二人中有十名工农同学被赶出校门；八名工农调干学生，就被赶走七名。
    看！陆平黑帮就这样对工农学生恨之入骨。
