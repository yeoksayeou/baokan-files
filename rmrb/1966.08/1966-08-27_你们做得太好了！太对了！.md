On August 20, I traveled from Tongxian County to Beijing. As I stepped into the city, my heart was filled with immense excitement. The first thing I saw was the slogans on the public buses: "Smash the old world and build a new world; change the old station names and establish new station names." Every corner of Beijing echoed with the calls of the Red Guards. They flooded the streets, posting revolutionary leaflets and big-character posters everywhere, spreading Mao Zedong Thought and revolutionary principles. The revolutionary spirit of the young Red Guards truly moved me. The various revolutionary scenes were beyond my ability to describe.

To the Red Guards of the capital: I wholeheartedly and resolutely support your spirit of rebellion and revolutionary actions.

Under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, your daring to think, speak, act, and revolt with great courage has stirred the hearts of everyone.

You bravely attack the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits left behind by the exploiting classes over thousands of years.

You have launched fierce attacks on all shop signs, street names, and anything that does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, carrying the taints of feudalism, capitalism, and modern revisionism.

You've done a great job! You're absolutely right! We support you a thousand times, ten thousand times! In the streets of the capital, I took many revolutionary leaflets from the Red Guards and returned home feeling overjoyed. I eagerly shared your revolutionary actions with all the medical staff. Your revolutionary spirit will forever be etched in my memory.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction; without removal, there can be no flow; without stopping, there can be no progress." Here, destruction means criticism, means revolution. To destroy is to argue, to argue is to build. With destruction as the priority, construction is also within it. Following Chairman Mao's teachings, you have done an excellent job of destroying and building. Finally, I once again salute the Beijing Red Guards and learn from you. I hope the radio and newspapers will frequently introduce the revolutionary spirit and actions of the Red Guards in the capital, so that the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers can be like the Red Guards, daring to revolt and good at revolting.

Let us fight side by side on the revolutionary path!

Long live the spirit of revolutionary rebellion!

Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!

    你们做得太好了！太对了！
    八月二十日这一天，我从郊区通县来北京。当我一步踏上北京城的时候，心情万分的激动，第一眼就看到在公共汽车的牌子上写着“打碎旧世界，建立新世界；改掉旧站名，建立新站名”等标语。在北京每一个角落都响起了红卫兵的号角，他们纷纷走上街头到处张贴革命传单和大字报，到处宣传毛泽东思想，宣传革命道理。看到革命小将们那种革命热情真使人感动。各种革命的场面，我很难以用语言表达出来。
    首都红卫兵小将们：我最热烈最坚决地支持你们的造反精神和革命的行动。
    你们在毛泽东思想伟大红旗指引下，敢想、敢说、敢闯、敢革命的大无畏精神，激动着我们每一个人的心。
    你们勇敢地冲击着剥削阶级几千年来遗留下来的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯。
    你们向一切不符合毛泽东思想的带有封建主义、资本主义和现代修正主义色彩的商店字号、街道名称发动了猛烈的攻击。
    你们做得太好了，太对了！我们一千个拥护，一万个拥护！我在首都街道上向红卫兵要了很多的革命传单，回来以后我高兴极了，向全体医务人员宣传了你们这一革命的行动。你们的这种革命豪情，我将永生难忘。
    毛主席教导我们：“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行”。这里讲的破，就是批判，就是革命。破就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。你们本着毛主席这一教导，破得很好，立得很好。最后，我再一次向北京红卫兵致敬，向你们学习。我希望电台和报纸经常介绍首都红卫兵小将的革命造反精神和革命行动，使广大工农兵群众都像红卫兵那样敢于革命，善于革命。
    让我们在革命的大道上并肩战斗吧！
    革命的造反精神万岁！
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
