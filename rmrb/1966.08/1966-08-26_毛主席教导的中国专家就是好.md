The phrase "Chinese experts are good because Chairman Mao teaches them well" is often heard from Malian friends. It sums up the impression Malian people have of Chinese experts who have come to help build Mali, based on their personal experiences.

Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, Chinese experts have worked closely with the Malian people over the past three years, overcoming numerous difficulties and refuting the malicious rumors spread by colonialists that "Mali cannot grow sugarcane," "cannot grow tea trees," "cannot produce sugar," and so on. They have successfully experimented with growing tea and sugarcane, built Mali's first sugar factory and first cigarette factory, as well as other construction projects, earning the praise of the Malian people. The Chinese experts also expressed their deep gratitude to the Malian government and people for their enthusiastic support.

Bringing the Great Leap Forward to Mali

The cigarette factory in Djoliba and the sugar factory in Dougabougou, both built with Chinese aid, started construction in the first quarter of 1965. These two factories were completed in just eight and fourteen months respectively, ending Mali's history of not being able to produce cigarettes and sugar, two important consumer goods. The news spread, and Mali rejoiced. Visitors to these two factories were endless. Many visitors said: The Chinese experts have brought the Great Leap Forward to Mali.

March, April, and May are the hottest months in Mali, with outdoor temperatures often around 45 degrees Celsius. Despite their clothes being soaked with sweat and their hands blistered by the hot metal, the Chinese experts, following Chairman Mao's teachings, displayed internationalist spirit, enduring the scorching heat to continue their work. Seeing this, Malian workers couldn't help but give a thumbs up, saying: "Mao Zedong is good, the Chinese are good" (in Bambara, "good" is "Agaï").

President Keita once said: "The Chinese experts not only brought technology to Mali, but more importantly, they set an example for the Malian people with their revolutionary spirit."

Sincere Friendship and Selfless Aid

Now, a folk song praising the great Mali-China friendship is popular in Mali. The song goes:

Ah, Mali-China friendship,
Mali-China friendship is sincere,
The Chinese came to Mali,
All Malian people are happy....

This song expresses the Malian people's love for Chinese experts.

A technician at the cigarette factory, Sasama, said: "When Mali was in its most difficult time, it received selfless aid from the People's Republic of China, which is a true manifestation of proletarian internationalism." A postal worker, Goulbaly, said: "China's aid is the most practical and effective. But some socialist countries give us luxurious items that are unrelated to production development, which only hinder the development of our national economy. Therefore, we call the Mali-China friendship sincere and China's aid selfless."

In their joint work, technicians and workers from both countries have built a deep friendship, like a family.

During the construction of the cigarette factory, two Chinese female technicians came to Mali and quickly taught Malian female workers how to package cigarettes. When these two Chinese women completed their mission and returned home, all the Malian female workers at the factory bid them farewell with tears in their eyes. The Malian women learned to sing Chinese songs from the Chinese women: "The East Is Red" and "Listen to the Party's Words." Now they often sing these two songs to remember their Chinese friends.

The Malian government and people often provide enthusiastic help and warm care to Chinese experts in their work and daily life. Leaders of the Malian government, such as President Keita and Minister of Development Kouyaté, often visit the construction sites and units where Chinese experts work, help solve problems encountered in work, and give great encouragement and support to the Chinese experts. The workers at the Marakala Mechanical Repair Factory always prioritize and promptly complete tasks when Chinese experts come to repair machinery and make parts.

"Long live Mao Zedong!"

Malian friends often say: Chinese experts are good because Chairman Mao teaches them well. A Malian technician at the cigarette factory said: "Chairman Mao loves the working people the most. He is always concerned with the liberation of the working people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America." A Malian worker at the sugar factory said to the Chinese experts: "The path indicated by Mao Zedong is the path that revolutionary people of the world should take."

In May, on the first day of trial operation at the Dougabougou sugar factory, all Malian workers and local residents came to the factory like celebrating a festival. The factory was crowded with people inside and outside the workshops. When the white sugar flowed out of the machine, people sang and danced, shouting: "Long live the People's Republic of China!" "Long live Mali-China friendship!" A Malian worker even sang a song praising Chairman Mao in Chinese: "The East Is Red." At this moment, all the workers decided to send a sample of the first batch of sugar produced to the beloved Chairman Mao Zedong.

Now, in the cities and villages of Mali, Malian people, regardless of gender or age, smile and wave when they see Chinese experts or Chinese people, and greet them in Chinese: "Hello." Some Malians give a thumbs up and shout: "Long live New China!" "Long live Mao Zedong!"

Chinese experts, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, have come to Mali to serve the Malian people wholeheartedly. The picture shows Chinese experts and Malian workers picking tea together.

### 毛主席教导的中国专家就是好

    毛主席教导的中国专家就是好
    “中国专家好，是因为毛主席教导得好。”这是马里朋友们经常说的一句话，它概括了马里人民通过自己的切身体验对帮助马里进行建设的中国专家们的印象。
    在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的中国专家，在来到马里的三年多来，同马里人民密切合作，克服了重重困难，粉碎了殖民主义者恶意散布的“马里不能种甘蔗”，“不能种茶树”，“不能生产糖”等等鬼话。他们试种成功了茶树和甘蔗，建设成了马里的第一座糖厂和第一座卷烟厂，以及其它的建设项目，博得了马里广大人民异口同声赞扬。中国专家对于马里政府和人民给予他们的种种热情帮助也表示十分感谢。
    把大跃进带到了马里
    中国援助建设的吉奥利巴卷烟厂和杜加布古糖厂都是在一九六五年第一季度开工兴建的，这两座工厂分别在八个月和十四个月的短时间内就建成了，从而结束了马里自己不能生产纸烟和食糖这两种重要消费品的历史。消息传出，马里举国欢腾，到这两个厂参观的人络绎不绝。许多参观者这样说：中国专家把大跃进带到了马里。
    三、四、五月是马里最炎热的季节，室外温度经常在摄氏四十五度左右，中国专家尽管衣衫被汗水全部浸透，手被太阳晒得灼热的金属烫起了泡，而他们遵循毛主席的教导，发扬国际主义精神，冒着酷暑坚持劳动。马里工人看到这种情景，情不自禁地伸出大拇指说：“毛泽东阿嘎伊，中国人阿嘎伊”（邦巴拉语“阿嘎伊”是“好”的意思）。
    凯塔总统有一次说：“中国专家不仅给马里带来了技术，更重要的是他们以自己的革命精神给马里人民树立了榜样。”
    真诚的友谊　无私的援助
    现在在马里流行着一首歌颂伟大的中马友谊的民歌。歌中唱道：
    啊，马中友谊，
    马中友谊是真诚的，
    中国人来到了马里，
    所有马里人民都高兴。……
    这首歌唱出了马里人民对中国专家的热爱。
    卷烟厂的电工萨萨马说：“马里在最困难的时候得到中华人民共和国的无私援助，这是真正的无产阶级国际主义精神的表现。”一位邮局职员古里巴利说：“中国的援助是最实际最有效的。但是有些社会主义国家却给我们搞那些奢华的、同发展生产无关的东西，这只能在我国民族经济发展的道路上起障碍作用。所以我们把马中友谊称为真诚的，把中国的援助叫作无私的”。
    在共同的劳动中，中马两国技术人员和工人建立了深厚的友谊，亲如一家。
    在卷烟厂兴建期间，有两位中国女技工来马里把包装纸烟等技术迅速地教给了马里女工。后来这两位中国女工完成了传授任务回国时，这个厂的所有马里女工都含着眼泪恋恋不舍地去送行。马里女工曾向中国女工学会了唱中国歌曲：《大海航行靠舵手》和《听话要听党的话》。现在她们时常唱起这两首歌曲来怀念她们的中国朋友。
    马里政府和人民对待中国专家在工作上和生活上经常给予热情的帮助和亲切的关怀。马里政府的领导人如凯塔总统，发展部长库亚特等经常到中国专家工作的建设工地和单位去视察工作，帮助解决工作上遇到的困难，给中国专家们很大的鼓舞和支持。马尔卡拉机械修配厂的马里职工，每当中国专家去修理机械和配制零件时，总是优先协助，及时完成。
    “毛泽东万岁！”
    马里朋友们时常说：中国专家好，是因为毛泽东主席教导得好。卷烟厂的一位马里技术人员说：“毛泽东主席最爱劳动人民，他总是为谋求亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的劳动人民的解放而操心。”糖厂的一位马里工人对中国专家说：“毛泽东指引的道路，就是世界革命人民要走的道路。”
    今年五月间，杜加布古糖厂进行试榨的第一天，全厂的马里职工和当地居民像欢度节日一样来到了工厂，车间内外人山人海，当白花花的蔗糖从机器里流出来时，人们载歌载舞，高呼：“中华人民共和国万岁！”“马中友谊万岁！”一位马里工人还用中国话唱了歌颂毛主席的歌曲《东方红》。这时，全体职工决定，把生产出来的第一批糖的一份样品，寄给敬爱的毛泽东主席。
    现在，在马里的城市和乡村里，马里人民不论男女老幼，看到中国专家或中国人就笑容满面地招手，并用中国话说：“你好”。有的马里人竖起大拇指高呼：“新中国万岁！”“毛泽东万岁！”
