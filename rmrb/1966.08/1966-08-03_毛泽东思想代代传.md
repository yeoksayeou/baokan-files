	Mao Zedong Thought Passed Down from Generation to Generation
	Zheng Junzhao, Party Branch Secretary of Jiangren Brigade, Xian County, Shaanxi Province
	Tian Wenthi, Brigade Leader

	In the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the socialist education movement, our deepest understanding is that peasants cannot just focus on farming and ignore everything else. The countryside is a battlefield. On this battlefield, we must engage in productive labor and simultaneously learn military affairs, politics, and culture. We must carry out the socialist education movement, criticize the bourgeoisie, and transform the countryside into a revolutionary school. Without the ideological transformation of the broad masses of peasants, building a socialist new countryside is just empty talk, and we will eventually stray onto the wrong path.

	Our Jiangren Village is a living example. From land reform, mutual aid, and cooperation to the establishment of people's communes, the class struggle and the struggle between the two lines in the countryside have been extremely fierce. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Jiangren Village, through the great socialist education movement, have defeated the rampant attacks of feudal forces and capitalist forces in the countryside, seized the leadership, and taken control of the power, the military, and the pen. This shows that power can be lost even after it has been gained. How can we ensure that we do not lose power? After heated discussions among the broad masses of commune members, everyone agreed that the countryside should be seen as a battlefield for the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat to seize and counter-seize power, and we must fight against the landlord class and the bourgeoisie on all fronts.

	Learn politics, learn what? It is to learn Mao Zedong Thought, to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and to use Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything. Everyone says: "Of all the rules, the first is to learn Mao Zedong Thought; of all the fears, the greatest is to fear nothing with Mao Zedong Thought."

	Over the past year, through night schools and study groups, we have consistently insisted on learning Mao Zedong Thought, remaining steadfast even in the face of storms and winds. Now, the entire brigade has been organized, and over five hundred adult commune members are participating in the study. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants love to learn more and more, and they love Mao Zedong Thought more and more.

	Since the socialist education movement began, especially since the Cultural Revolution, we have taken the problems of class struggle as our starting point, using Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, and continuously criticizing all ghosts and monsters, including those at the national, provincial, and village levels. All these criticisms have greatly raised the political awareness of the broad masses of commune members. More and more people have come to realize that to build a socialist society and advance towards a communist society, we must constantly struggle against the spiritual shackles imposed on the working people by the exploiting classes. This spring, during the spring ploughing and production activities, many young people in our village published articles on the blackboard newspaper discussing the relationship between public and private interests, exposing various bourgeois ideas. During the Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of commune members analyzed, from a class perspective, several thousand years of feudal ancient associations such as "Mama's Association," "Lord's Association," and "Horse King's Association," and uncovered the origins of these ancient associations, all of which were tricks played by the landlord class. In the past, they were tools used by the exploiting classes to deceive the people; today, they are strongholds for the restoration of capitalism, and they are part of the same poisonous root as the counter-revolutionary plots of the "San Jia Village" clique. Everyone rose up to attack them, and the ancient associations were overthrown.

	We use the sharp weapon of Mao Zedong Thought to criticize bourgeois ideas, and the ideological appearance of the commune members has undergone tremendous changes. Some women in the fourth group of Nanmen Production Team used to be very selfish and had serious liberal tendencies. People called the alley where they lived "Alley of Disputes." After studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," they understood the meaning of farming for the revolution and now compete to serve the public, sweeping the streets clean before dawn. Now, everyone calls the alley where they live "Red Fourth Group."

	Our direction of advance is to realize communism in China and throughout the world. Chairman Mao has pointed out the direction for us to complete this great historical task. We must actively learn from and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle for the communist cause. We will study for a lifetime, use for a lifetime, and struggle for a lifetime. This universal truth of Mao Zedong Thought for revolution, we must pass down from generation to generation.

    毛泽东思想代代传
    陕西省长安县细柳公社姜仁大队党支部书记　郑君照  大队长田文治
    在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命和社会主义教育运动中，我们最深刻的体会是：农民不能只管务农，不顾其他。农村是一个阵地，在这个阵地上，我们要从事生产劳动，还要兼学军事、学政治、学文化，要搞社会主义教育运动，要批判资产阶级，要把农村变成一所革命化的大学校。没有广大农民思想革命化，建设社会主义新农村就是空谈，迟早会走到邪路上去。
    我们姜仁村就是个活例子。从土地改革、互助合作，到人民公社化，农村的阶级斗争、两条道路斗争非常激烈。姜仁村的贫下中农，经过伟大的社会主义教育运动，才打垮了农村封建势力和资本主义势力的猖狂进攻，夺回了领导权，掌握了印把子、刀把子、笔杆子。这说明得了权还可能失权。如何才能保证不失权？经过广大社员的热烈讨论，大家认为，应该把农村看作资产阶级和无产阶级夺权和反夺权斗争的阵地，从各个方面同地主阶级、资产阶级斗。
    学政治，学什么？就是要学习毛泽东思想，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，用毛泽东思想统帅一切。大家说：“千条，万条，学习毛泽东思想第一条；千怕，万怕，有了毛泽东思想什么都不怕。”
    一年多来，我们通过夜校和学习小组，始终坚持学习毛泽东思想，做到雷打不倒，风吹不散。现在全大队已经组织起来，参加学习的成年社员达到了五百多人。广大贫下中农越学越爱学，越学越热爱毛泽东思想。
    社会主义教育运动开展以后，特别是文化大革命以来，我们带着阶级斗争中的问题，以毛泽东思想为武器，不断地批判一切牛鬼蛇神，包括全国的、本省的、本村本队的。所有这些批判，大大地提高了广大社员的政治觉悟。越来越多的人认识到，要建设社会主义社会，走向共产主义社会，必须跟剥削阶级强加在劳动人民身上的精神枷锁作不断的斗争。今年春天，围绕着春耕生产活动，我们村上许多青年在黑板报上发表了一论、二论和三论公私关系，揭露了形形色色资产阶级的思想。在文化大革命中，广大社员用阶级观点分析了几千年来遗留下来的什么“娘娘会”、“府君会”、“马王会”等等封建古会，查明了这些古会的来历，全都是地主阶级玩弄的鬼把戏。过去，它是剥削阶级用来愚弄人民的手段；今天，它是资本主义复辟的阵地，跟“三家村”黑帮搞的那一套反革命阴谋，是从一条毒根上长出来的。大家群起而攻之，打倒了古会。
    我们用毛泽东思想的锐利武器，批判资产阶级思想，社员的思想面貌发生了很大的变化。南门生产队第四组一些妇女，过去自私心很大，自由主义严重，人们把她们住的巷子叫“是非巷”。她们学习了《为人民服务》以后，懂得了为革命种田的道理，现在争着为公，天不明就把街道扫干净了。现在，大家把她们住的巷子叫“红四组”了。
    我们前进的方向，是要在中国和全世界实现共产主义，毛主席给我们指示了完成这个伟大的历史任务的方向，我们一定要在为共产主义事业的斗争中活学活用毛主席著作。学一辈子，用一辈子，斗争一辈子。毛泽东思想这个干革命的普遍真理，我们要一代一代传下去。
