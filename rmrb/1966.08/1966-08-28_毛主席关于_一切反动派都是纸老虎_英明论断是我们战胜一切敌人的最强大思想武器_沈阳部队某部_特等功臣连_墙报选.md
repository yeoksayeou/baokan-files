The People's Liberation Army's Shenyang Military Region's "First-Class Hero Company" recently reviewed Chairman Mao's "Talk with the American Journalist Anna Louise Strong" and published articles in their wall newspaper to commemorate it. The following are a few selected articles from the company's wall newspaper:

First, We Must Overcome the Enemy Spiritually

Class Leader Hua Yongxiang

Chairman Mao's brilliant judgment that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers has given us the great power to overcome all enemies. With this power, we dare to make revolution, dare to struggle, and dare to win. We can boost our morale and crush the enemy's arrogance, trampling all enemies underfoot.

Bravery, fearlessness of death, and daring to despise the enemy and difficulties are the prerequisites for overcoming any enemy and difficulty. In our class, there is a soldier named Liu Yongjun. Before joining the army, he was even afraid to set off firecrackers. After enlisting, his class consciousness greatly improved. In a tactical attack drill, he threw a grenade at an "enemy fort." The grenade was deflected by a tree branch next to the fort's aperture and rolled back down, smoking. Liu Yongjun immediately picked up the grenade and threw it again at the fort. In an instant, the grenade exploded inside the fort. This incident shows: if one is afraid in their mind, they won't even dare to set off firecrackers; if one is not afraid in their mind, they dare to pick up a smoking grenade. This is the power of the spirit. I think, for imperialism and reactionaries, we must first overcome them spiritually. Only by overcoming them spiritually can we dare to annihilate them and devour them.

Overcoming the enemy spiritually and despising them is the most precious quality a revolutionary should possess. With this spirit, one will have the greatest courage and wisdom. Of course, in the concrete process of fighting them, we must also take them seriously and treat them as real tigers. We will eat them piece by piece and ultimately send American imperialism and all reactionaries to their graves.

The Nature of Reactionaries Will Never Change

Soldier Yang Linzhu

"The seas churn with clouds and waves, the continents shake with thunder and lightning." Currently, the anti-American storm among the world's people is surging, and the flames of revolution are burning brighter. American imperialism is being beaten and cursed everywhere. In such a situation, will American imperialism cause more trouble? I pondered this question while studying Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again until they are wiped out—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world, and they will not deviate from this logic." This is a mirror that reveals the true face of all reactionaries. Using this mirror, we can see the true form of imperialism.

Imperialism wants to invade, and the invaded people will resist. Invasion, resistance; oppression, resistance—this is the history of class struggle in human society.

We must use Chairman Mao's scientific Marxist-Leninist judgment to view imperialism and all reactionaries. They will cause trouble because it is their nature. The more trouble they cause, the faster they will meet their doom. They are destined to fail, which is the inevitable law of historical development. After failing, as long as they have not been completely wiped out, they will continue to cause trouble. Therefore, we must stay vigilant and be prepared at all times.

From this perspective, we can see clearly, stand tall, and look far, unperturbed by any illusions. No matter what dark clouds appear in the world, we will remain steadfast and march forward, resolutely exposing and annihilating the seemingly ferocious American imperialist paper tiger!

The Truly Powerful Force is the People

Political Instructor Zhang Dianmei

Chairman Mao pointed out, "... these reactionaries will one day fail, and we will one day win. The reason is not otherwise, but because the reactionaries represent reaction, and we represent progress." The development of human history is like this: the slave society was eliminated, the feudal society was eliminated, and capitalism is also being eliminated. Although reactionaries may seem powerful for a time, they will ultimately be crushed by the wheels of human history. The truly powerful force is the people.

The history of our company fully proves this. During the War of Liberation and the Korean War, we closely relied on the people and defeated the enemy. The facts prove that reactionaries who go against the will of the people are paper tigers; the facts also prove that as long as we rely on the people, we can be invincible and conquer all enemies. In November 1950, before the battle of Songguk Peak in Korea, the Korean people braved the wind and snow to guide us, helping us cross mountains and take shortcuts to get ahead of the enemy, block their path, and achieve this great victory. All the facts in our company prove that without the people, we would be helpless, but with the people, we can defeat all enemies. The people's power is boundless. Our army comes from the people and serves the people. We represent the fundamental interests of the broad masses of laboring people, and we have obtained the greatest support from the broad masses of laboring people. Our power is invincible.

Today, as we study Chairman Mao's "Talk with the American Journalist Anna Louise Strong," we must learn Chairman Mao's firm belief in and reliance on the people. From this point of view, we will have the heroic spirit to overcome all enemies and difficulties, and we will not be deceived by any temporary illusions. We will march forward bravely and annihilate all reactionaries.

Reactionaries Without Guns Are Also Paper Tigers

Class Leader Su Dengming

Since the Cultural Revolution, numerous excellent articles written by our workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals have been published in newspapers, each sentence is reasonable, and each word is satisfying, refuting those bourgeois "authorities" to the point where they have no defense. These articles are far superior to those written by the group of "authorities." The pen of the workers, peasants, and soldiers is the hardest, and the greatest authority is the workers, peasants, and soldiers! The reactionaries' pens are paper tigers, unable to withstand fire, unable to withstand the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought, and cannot escape the eyes of the broad masses of workers and peasants. Currently, a group of black gangs have been exposed, and a batch of black goods have been revealed. They can no longer ride on the heads of the people and act arrogantly. These reactionaries are just like the reactionaries we fought on the battlefield in the past; they are all paper tigers.

The pens of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the pens of revolutionary intellectuals, represent progress and are the drivers of historical development. Chairman Mao said: things that represent progress will ultimately eliminate things that represent reaction, which is a rule of historical development that has been set long ago. Whether the enemy has guns or not, they absolutely cannot escape this rule. We workers, peasants, and soldiers, and revolutionary intellectuals, will definitely become stronger and braver in this Cultural Revolution that touches people's souls. We will use Mao Zedong Thought, the sharpest weapon, to smash all reactionary "pens" to smithereens!

Preparation Leads to Victory

Soldier Li Yunhui

Chairman Mao said: "Superiority without preparation is not true superiority and does not have the initiative. Understanding this, an inferior force with preparation can often launch a surprise attack on the enemy and defeat the superior force." This means that preparation and lack of preparation are vastly different. Only with preparation can we be free from worries and achieve victory. During a rushed march, due to my complacency, I wore a pair of small shoes, blistered my feet, and fell behind. Learning from this, I always make sure I am prepared for battle. Soon, our company went on another field march. The distance was farther, and the march was more urgent than before; however, because I prepared everything thoroughly, I walked smoothly. Comrades said, "'Cannon' has become iron feet."

These two marches made me deeply realize that without proper preparation, iron feet become a "cannon," turning superiority into inferiority; with preparation, a "cannon" becomes iron feet, turning inferiority into superiority. The quality of preparation is extremely important for successfully completing a task. American imperialism is currently the world's number one warmonger, expanding its military and preparing for war everywhere. We must not harbor any illusions about imperialism and all reactionaries. We must maintain high alertness and be fully prepared, thinking of the worst scenario, and being ready for early, large-scale, nuclear, and various types of wars on multiple fronts. With such thorough preparation, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we will definitely defeat American imperialism and all reactionaries. Victory will surely be on our side.

Currently, American imperialism is escalating the Vietnam War to a more serious level and is scheming to impose war on our people. We must be even more fully prepared, ready at any time to join the Vietnamese people and all revolutionary people around the world to annihilate this paper tiger that is flailing its claws!

    毛主席关于“一切反动派都是纸老虎”英明论断是我们战胜一切敌人的最强大思想武器
    ——沈阳部队某部“特等功臣连”墙报选
    据新华社沈阳二十七日电　人民解放军沈阳部队某部“特等功臣连”的干部、战士最近重温了毛主席《和美国记者安娜·路易斯·斯特朗的谈话》，并在墙报上发表文章表示纪念。现将这个连的墙报文章选登几篇于下：
    首先要在精神上压倒敌人
    班长　华永祥
    毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断，给了我们压倒一切敌人的巨大力量。有了这种力量，就敢于革命，敢于斗争，敢于胜利。就能长自己的志气，灭敌人的威风，把一切敌人踩在脚下。
    勇敢，不怕死，敢于藐视敌人和困难，这是战胜任何敌人和困难的前提。我们班有个战士刘永君，在家时连纸炮也不敢放。入伍后，阶级觉悟大大提高。在一次战术进攻演习中，他把一颗手榴弹投向“敌堡”，手榴弹被地堡眼旁边的树枝挡了回来，冒着烟往下滚。刘永君立即捡起手榴弹，再次掷向地堡，刹那间，手榴弹便在地堡里爆炸了。这件事说明：思想上害怕，连纸炮都不敢放；思想上不怕，冒烟的手榴弹都敢拾起来。这就是精神力量的作用，我想，对于帝国主义和反动派也要首先从精神上压倒它，只有在精神上首先压倒它，才敢于消灭它，吃掉它。
    从精神上压倒敌人，藐视它，这是一个革命者应当具备的最可贵的气魄。有了这种气魄就会有最大的勇敢、智慧。当然，具体同它斗的过程中，也要重视它，把它当成真老虎来打。一块一块吃掉它，最后把美帝国主义和一切反动派送进坟墓。
    反动派的本质永远不会变
    战士　杨林竹
    “四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激。”当前世界人民的反美风暴日益高涨，革命烈火越烧越旺。美帝国主义到处挨打受骂。在这样情况下，美帝国主义会不会再捣乱呢？我带着这一问题学习了毛主席著作。毛主席说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”这是对一切反动派的一面照妖镜，用这面照妖镜就可以照出帝国主义的原形。
    帝国主义要侵略，被侵略人民就要反侵略。侵略，反侵略；压迫，反压迫，这就是人类的阶级斗争史。
    我们就是要用毛主席这一科学的马克思列宁主义的英明论断来看帝国主义和一切反动派。它们要捣乱，这是它们本性决定的，捣乱越厉害，只会使它们灭亡越快。它们注定要失败，这是历史发展的必然规律。失败之后，只要它们没有全部灭亡，还会继续捣乱。因此，我们要提高警惕，常备不懈。
    从这一点出发看问题，我们就能心明眼亮，站得高，看得远，不会被任何假象所迷惑。不管世界上出现什么乌云，我们都坚定不移，勇往直前，坚决把貌似凶狠的美帝国主义纸老虎彻底戳穿，彻底消灭！
    真正强大的力量是人民
    指导员　张殿美
    毛主席指出，“……这些反动派总有一天要失败，我们总有一天要胜利。这原因不是别的，就在于反动派代表反动，而我们代表进步。”人类历史的发展就是这样，奴隶社会被消灭了，封建社会被消灭了，资本主义也正在被消灭。尽管反动派一时貌似强大，但它们终将要被人类历史前进的车轮压得粉碎，真正强大的力量是人民。
    我们连的历史充分说明了这一点。在解放战争中，在抗美援朝战争中，我们紧紧依靠人民，把敌人打得落花流水。事实证明，违反人民意志的反动派都是纸老虎；事实也证明，只要依靠人民，就能无坚不摧，无敌不克。一九五○年十一月，我们连在朝鲜松鼓峰战斗开始之前，朝鲜人民为我们顶风冒雪带路，使我们翻山越岭抄近路赶到敌人前头，堵住敌人，取得这次伟大胜利。我们连所有的事实全都证实了，没有人民，我们是寸步难行的，有了人民，我们就可以打垮一切敌人，人民的力量无穷。我军来自于人民，服务于人民，我们代表着广大劳动人民的根本利益，我们得到了广大劳动人民的最大支持，我们的力量是无敌的。
    我们今天学习毛主席《和美国记者安娜·路易斯·斯特朗的谈话》，就要学习毛主席这种坚决相信和依靠人民的思想。从这点出发，我们就会有压倒一切敌人和困难的英雄气概，而不会被任何一时的假象所蒙蔽，就会勇往直前，把所有的反动派统统消灭掉。
    不拿枪的敌人都是纸老虎炊事
    班长　苏登明
    文化大革命以来，报纸上发表的我们工农兵和革命知识分子写的大量好文章，句句在理，字字解恨，把那些资产阶级“权威”老爷们批驳得体无完肤。这些文章比那帮“权威”老爷们的文章高明得多，真是，最硬的笔杆子是我们工农兵，最大的权威是我们工农兵！反动派的笔杆子是纸老虎，见不得火，见不得毛泽东思想的阳光，逃不过广大工农兵群众的眼睛。当前一伙伙黑帮被揪了出来，一批批黑货被揭了出来，他们再也别想骑在人民头上作威作福了。这些反动家伙和我们过去在战场上打的那些反动派一样，都是纸老虎。
    我们工农兵的笔杆子，革命知识分子的笔杆子，是代表进步的，是历史发展的推动者。毛主席说：代表进步的东西总是最后消灭代表反动的东西，这是历史发展的规律早定好了的。拿枪的敌人也好，不拿枪的敌人也好，绝对逃不脱这个规律。我们工农兵和革命知识分子一定会在这次触及人们灵魂的文化大革命中，越战越强，越战越勇，用毛泽东思想这一最锐利武器，把所有的反动“笔杆子”，统统砸个稀巴烂！
    有备才能胜利
    战士　李云辉
    毛主席说：“优势而无准备，不是真正的优势，也没有主动。懂得这一点，劣势而有准备之军，常可对敌举行不意的攻势，把优势者打败。”这就是说，有准备和无准备大不一样，有备才能无患，有备才能胜利。在一次紧急行军时，由于我麻痹大意，错穿了一双小号鞋，脚板打起了泡，掉了队。吃一堑长一智，从此，我时时做好战斗准备。不久我们连又野营行军，路程比上次远，行军比上次还急；但是由于我什么都准备得妥妥当当，所以走得很顺利，同志们都说：“‘炮长’变成铁脚板了。”
    这两次行军，我深刻地体会到，准备不好，铁脚板就要变成“炮长”，这就是优势变劣势；有了准备，
  “炮长”就变成铁脚板，这就是劣势变优势，准备的好坏，对能否做好一件事情真是非常重要。美帝国主义是当今世界上的头号战争狂人，它四处扩军备战。我们对帝国主义和一切反动派绝不能抱任何幻想，一定要保持高度警惕，做好充分准备，从最坏处着想，作好早打、大打、打核战争、打各种战争、在几条战线上打的思想准备。我们有了这样充分的准备，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，就一定能打倒美帝国主义和一切反动派，胜利一定在我们这一边。
    当前美帝国主义正把侵越战争升级到更加严重的地步，并处心积虑地企图把战争强加到我国人民头上。我们更应该充分做好准备，随时准备与越南人民和全世界革命的人民一道，把这只张牙舞爪的纸老虎消灭掉！
