The spectators who came to watch sports competitions in the capital have never been as revolutionary and passionate as they were yesterday. The international competition held at the Beijing Workers' Gymnasium has never had such a revolutionary atmosphere as it did yesterday! At the opening ceremony of the 1966 Beijing International Table Tennis Invitational held last night, every aspect reflected the people's boundless love, faith, and admiration for the great teacher, great leader, great commander-in-chief, and great helmsman Chairman Mao.

The opening ceremony was about to begin. Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premiers He Long and Chen Yi, along with the leaders of various countries' delegations, entered the venue. The entire audience stood up, and thunderous applause and cheers echoed through the venue for a long time, finally converging into the earth-shaking slogan, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!"

During the rest period after the opening ceremony, the military band played one revolutionary song after another, each receiving a round of thunderous applause. The song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" especially stirred the entire audience to sing in unison, "Revolution depends on Mao Zedong Thought! Mao Zedong Thought is the sun that never sets!" At the audience's repeated enthusiastic requests, the band stood up, and the melody of "The East is Red" resonated through the gymnasium. All 15,000-plus spectators stood up and sang together; the resounding voices expressed the heartfelt praise of the Chinese people and the people of the world for the great revolutionary leader.

Many spectators who frequently watch competitions said: Such a scene has never been seen before. The atmosphere of the great proletarian cultural revolution has truly permeated the sports competitions. What a wonderful thing this is!

"I love Chairman Mao!"

The stirring revolutionary atmosphere appeared in the lobby even before the opening ceremony. Unlike in the past, many spectators held a shiny red copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao." As soon as they entered, they encountered a piece of good news: the New China Bookstore had specially prepared various portraits and works of our great leader Chairman Mao, as well as other revolutionary books for the spectators. Many people lined up to buy them as soon as they entered, and many comrades continued to purchase them after the opening ceremony. How many people bought multiple copies of Chairman Mao's portrait, feeling honored. Two African friends bought two colored portraits of Chairman Mao, shouting, "Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong!" A foreign friend brought his teenage son, bought a portrait of Chairman Mao wearing a Red Guard armband, and the child said in Chinese, "I love Chairman Mao!"

Revolutionary Spectators Gift Quotations

The spectators showed great concern for this meaningful international competition held in Beijing, the command center of the great proletarian cultural revolution in our country and the location of the Party Central Committee. They regarded it as an international event to promote friendship, mutual progress, common development, and unity against imperialism, wishing the conference would make significant contributions to unity against imperialism.

Before the opening ceremony began, the Vietnamese table tennis delegation received a letter and two quotations from Chairman Mao. These were sent by students who came to Beijing for revolutionary linkage. The letter read: "Salutations to the Vietnamese table tennis delegation from the front lines of anti-American resistance! Salutations to the heroic Vietnamese people! We resolutely stand as the strong rear guard for the Vietnamese people!..." The quotations read: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They seem terrifying, but in reality, they have no real power..."

The spectators in the capital were concerned about the Chinese table tennis team, and the spectators across the country were even more concerned.

During the preparation days before the competition, the Chinese table tennis team received a letter. The sender was identified as: A Red Guard from Wuhan who is forever loyal to Chairman Mao and forever defends the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. The letter also included a commemorative badge. The letter said: "...Big brothers and sisters, I am sending you my most cherished item—the commemorative badge from the 11th Wuhan Cross-Yangtze River Swimming Competition! Big brothers and sisters, this is not an ordinary gift! Do you know? That day—July 16th—is a day I will never, ever forget. That day, I saw our most beloved leader Chairman Mao! I shouted from my heart—and on behalf of you all—I shouted: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! This commemorative badge is the witness of my seeing Chairman Mao. Now, I am giving it to you. There is no other meaning; it is just to remind you that 'Chairman Mao is always by our side!' When facing difficulties, remember Chairman Mao's teachings: Resolve to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory..."

What Chairman Mao says, the people do

The entrance of the referees and athletes from various countries was also extraordinary.

The spirited referees, each holding a shiny red copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," led the way around the venue. Among the referees, Deputy Referee-in-Chief Qibi Ying, a former coal picker, was particularly excited: "Without the Party, without Chairman Mao, how could we have today!" Qibi Ying, who insists on studying Chairman Mao's works every day, drew strength from Chairman Mao's works before the competition, dispelled her fears, and bravely took on the role of Deputy Referee-in-Chief. At the opening ceremony, she excitedly told the reporter: "We always carry 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' because we all love Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought without limit."

Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the referees and venue staff successfully completed the first day's competition. They brought self-made "Quotations from Chairman Mao" cards to the score table, registration desk, and every work site. Referee Zhao Jiexian, who comes from a poor peasant family, during the judging of the men's team match between Japan and Nepal, heard the audience cheering for the Chinese and Sri Lankan athletes' excellent performance at the adjacent table. How he wanted to turn his head and look! "In the world, the most feared thing is the word 'serious'..." He raised his head and saw the large characters on the quotation card, immediately dispelling his distractions and continuing to work diligently.

The Chinese table tennis team members, dressed in red sportswear, also entered the venue holding red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Before the competition, Fu Qifang read to the men's team: "...Extreme responsibility to work, extreme enthusiasm for comrades and the people." And told everyone: Definitely remember Chairman Mao's teachings, with an extremely responsible spirit to face every ball. Cong Kuan read to the women's team: "The Communist Party is the most serious about 'seriousness'." The team members held the quotations, each nodding. What Chairman Mao said, they did. On the competition field, the team members were diligent, facing every ball seriously, and even when far ahead in the score, they did not relax, earning thunderous applause from the 15,000-plus spectators.

The Red Guards Listen to Chairman Mao the Most

The workers inside and outside the competition venue included many Red Guard youths. They each held a bright red copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," some collecting tickets at the door, some maintaining order in the stands, some cleaning the lobby... Their attitudes were enthusiastic yet serious. They said: We Red Guards must enthusiastically propagate and defend Mao Zedong Thought. We read "Quotations from Chairman Mao" every day to make Chairman Mao's voice resonate around the world! We are here to serve the people as Chairman Mao said.

These revolutionary youths actively apply Chairman Mao's works, regarding every piece of work as a concrete manifestation of serving the people and the world revolution. They saw completing this task as a good opportunity to "learn in struggle, use in struggle."

The Red Guards serving outside the gymnasium received the task in the afternoon. As soon as they received the task, they took out "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to study, thinking: This is the Party and Chairman Mao's care for us Red Guards. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words and complete the task well. They lined up at five o'clock and chanted "Quotations from Chairman Mao" as they walked. The Red Guards said: We must complete the task well, relying on Mao Zedong Thought.

After the opening ceremony began, cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!" and the majestic song "The East is Red" echoed through the competition hall. At that time, some Red Guards were sweeping the floor and cleaning the lobby. The door-keeping Red Guards were also on duty. Cheers, songs, and applause echoed continuously, and the strong atmosphere inside the venue deeply moved them.

At this moment, we interviewed a female Red Guard who was guarding the door. When the cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao" echoed from inside, she could not contain her excitement.

But she said: "When I hear the cheers of 'Long live Chairman Mao,' I think we must remember Chairman Mao's teachings and do our work better. Chairman Mao taught us not to forget class struggle. Now class struggle is sharp and complex, and we must be vigilant." So she stood guard, not leaving her post for a moment.

When she knew we wanted to report on the deeds of the Red Guards, she hurriedly said: "Don't write my name. If we did it right, this is what we Red Guards should do."

The Red Guards do not seek fame or personal gain, wholeheartedly serving the people and the revolution, always busy at their posts.

The first day's competition ended, but the revolutionary atmosphere of the opening ceremony still lingered in people's minds. Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, this year's Beijing International Table Tennis Invitational will definitely be held successfully and spectacularly, making new contributions to the cause of unity and anti-imperialism for the people of the world.

    万众高歌《东方红》
    ——北京国际乒乓球邀请赛开幕式特写
    首都看体育比赛的观众，从来没有像昨天那样革命热情奔放；在北京工人体育馆举行的国际比赛，从来没有像昨天那样革命气氛浓烈！在昨晚举行的一九六六年北京国际乒乓球邀请赛开幕式上，处处体现了人们对伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜的革命豪情。
    开幕式即将开始。周恩来总理和贺龙、陈毅副总理等国家领导人陪同各国代表团团长等进场时，全场观众起立，雷鸣般的掌声和欢呼声长时间地激荡全场，最后凝成了震天动地的“毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！”的口号声。
    在开幕式结束之后的休息时间里，军乐团奏出的一支又一支革命歌曲赢得了一阵又一阵雷鸣般的掌声。一曲《大海航行靠舵手》，更带动了全场观众引吭高歌，万众异口同声欢唱“干革命靠的是毛泽东思想！”“毛泽东思想是不落的太阳！”在观众一再热烈地要求下，乐团起立了，《东方红》乐曲声在馆内激荡，全场一万五千多观众一齐站了起来大合唱；嘹亮的歌声，唱出了中国人民和世界人民对伟大的革命领袖最衷心的赞颂。
    许多最经常观看比赛的观众说：这样的场面真是从来都不曾见过。无产阶级文化大革命的气氛真正带到体育比赛中来了。这是多么好的事情呵！“
    我爱毛泽东！”
    激动人心的革命气氛在开幕式之前就出现在休息大厅里了。同过去不一样，许多观众手里都拿着一本红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》。一进门，他们又遇到了一件大喜事：大厅里，新华书店特意为观众准备了我们伟大领袖毛主席的各种画像和各种著作，还有其它一些革命书籍。许多人一进门就排队购买，许多同志在开幕式后还跑出来选购。多少人，毛主席像片一买数张，引以为荣。两位非洲朋友选购了两张彩色的毛主席像，口里还喊：“毛泽东！毛泽东！”一位外国朋友带着他的十几岁的儿子走过来，买了一张毛主席戴着红卫兵袖章的像片，小孩用中国话说：“我爱毛泽东！”
    革命观众赠语录
    观众对在我国伟大的无产阶级文化大革命的指挥部、党中央所在地北京举行的这次意义深远的国际比赛十分关心。他们把它看成是增进友好，互相促进，共同发展，团结反帝的国际盛会，祝愿大会为团结反帝作出重大贡献。
    在开幕式开始之前，越南乒乓球代表团接到了一封信和两条毛主席语录。这是远道前来北京进行革命串联的同学送给他们的。信上写着：向来自抗美最前线的越南乒乓球代表团致敬！向英雄的越南人民致敬！我们坚决作越南人民的坚强后盾！……语录上写道：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。……”
    对于中国乒乓球队，首都观众关心，全国各地广大的观众更为关心。
    在赛前的准备日子里，中国乒乓球队收到了一封来信，署名是：武汉市一个永远忠于毛主席，永远捍卫毛泽东思想光辉的红卫兵。信里还有一枚纪念章。信中说：“……大哥哥、大姐姐们，我把我最心爱的东西——武汉市第十一届横渡长江比赛纪念章送给你们！大哥哥、大姐姐，这不是一件平常的礼物呵！你们知道吗？那一天——七月十六日，是我永远永远也不能忘记的一天。那天，我见到了我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席！我从心里喊出——也代表你们喊出了：毛主席万岁！万万岁！这个纪念章就是我见到毛主席的见证。现在，我把它送给你们，没有别的意思，就是要你们看到它时，就想：‘毛主席就在我们身边！’；碰到困难时，就记住毛主席的教导：下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。……”
    毛主席怎么说，人们就怎么做
    裁判员和各国运动员们的入场式也是不同平常的。
    精神振奋的裁判员们，每人手拿一本红光闪耀的《毛主席语录》，领头绕场一周。走在队伍中的副裁判长、过去拣过煤核的女工祁秀英心情异常激动：“没有党，没有毛主席，那能有今天啊！”坚持天天学习毛主席著作的祁秀英，这次赛前又从毛主席著作中吸取了前进的动力，消除了畏难情绪，勇敢地担负起副裁判长的职务。在开幕式上，她激动地对记者说：“我们随时都带着《毛主席语录》，因为我们全体裁判员都无限热爱毛主席、无限热爱毛泽东思想。”
    在毛泽东思想指导下，裁判员们和场地工作人员们胜利完成了第一天比赛的任务。他们把自制的毛主席语录牌带到记分桌上、报到台旁……带到一切工作的现场。出身于贫农的裁判员赵辑贤，在担任日本、尼泊尔男子团体赛的裁判过程中，听见观众为旁边台上中国、锡兰运动员的精采表演热烈鼓掌时，多么想扭头看一看啊！“世界上怕就怕‘认真’二字，……”他一抬头就看见语录牌上这几个大字，马上便消除了杂念，继续一丝不苟地认真工作起来。
    穿着红色运动衣的中国乒乓球队的男女队员们，今天也手拿着红色的《毛主席语录》进入场内。赛前，傅其芳向男队员们念道：“……对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。”并告诉大家：一定要牢记毛主席的教导，以极端负责任的精神对待每一个球。容国团向女队员们朗读了“共产党就最讲‘认真’”的语录。队员们手捧语录，个个点头。毛主席怎么说的，他们就怎么去做。在比赛场上，队员们兢兢业业，认真对付每一个球，即使在比分遥遥领先的情况下，也毫不松劲，博得了一万五千多观众雷动的掌声。
    红卫兵最听毛主席的话
    比赛场内外的工作人员，有许多是红卫兵小将。他们也是人手一册鲜红的
  《毛主席语录》，有的把门收票，有的在看台上维持秩序，有的在休息厅打扫卫生……，态度热情而又严肃。他们说：我们红卫兵要热情地宣传和捍卫毛泽东思想，我们天天念《毛主席语录》，要使毛主席的声音响遍全世界！我们是听毛主席的话，到这里来为人民服务的。
    这些革命小将们，活学活用毛主席著作，他们把一切工作都看成是为人民服务，为世界革命服务的具体表现。他们把完成这次任务，看作是“在斗争中学，在斗争中用”的一个好机会。
    在体育馆外服务的红卫兵，是下午才接到任务的。一接到任务，他们就拿出《毛主席语录》来学习，他们想：这是党和毛主席对我们红卫兵的关怀，我们一定听毛主席的话，把任务完成好。五点多钟就整队来，一边走一边念《毛主席语录》。红卫兵们说：我们要完成好任务，就要靠毛泽东思想。
    开幕式开始后，比赛厅里，不断传来“毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！”的欢呼声和雄壮的《东方红》的歌声。这时，一些红卫兵们，正在休息厅里拖地板、打扫卫生。守门收票的红卫兵也在坚守岗位。欢呼声、歌声、掌声不断传来，场内歌颂毛主席的强烈气氛，深深地激动了他们。
    就在此时，我们访问了一位把门的女红卫兵。当场内传出一阵高似一阵的“毛主席万岁”的欢呼声时，她真压抑不住内心的激动。
    但她说：“当我听到‘毛主席万岁’的欢呼声时，我就想，我们一定要牢记毛主席的教导，更好地做好工作。毛主席教导我们千万不要忘记阶级斗争。现在阶级斗争很尖锐复杂，一定要提高警惕。”于是她就坚守岗位，一步也不离开。
    当她知道我们要报道红卫兵的事迹时，急忙说：
  “不要写我的名字。如果我们做对了，这是我们红卫兵应该做的事。”
    红卫兵们不为名，不为利，一心为人民，一心为革命，始终忙碌在自己的工作岗位上。
    第一天的比赛结束了，开幕式上的革命气氛却仍然在人们脑海中萦回。在伟大的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，今年的北京国际乒乓球邀请赛一定会举行得很成功、很精采，并对世界人民团结反帝的事业作出新的贡献。
