The news of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's decision to accelerate the mass publication of Chairman Mao's works has spread to various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities along the borders. People of all ethnic groups are overjoyed and unanimously shout: This is a great joy in the political life of all ethnic groups in our country, and it is the greatest care from the Party Central Committee for all ethnic groups. They have expressed their determination to better study and implement Mao Zedong Thought, to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end, and to ensure that our country remains unchanged for generations to come.

The news reached Hohhot City, and everyone was overjoyed. Zhang Daoshan, a worker from the Railway Bureau, said, "We are in charge of transportation. We will definitely treat the transportation of Chairman Mao's works as a top political task, prioritize it in our transportation work, and quickly deliver Chairman Mao's works to the workers, peasants, and soldiers." On the 8th, the entire company of a certain unit in the Xining region was harvesting wheat in the fields. When the news arrived, all the soldiers shouted in unison: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Mao Zedong Thought!" They then spontaneously sang the revolutionary song "The Great Ship Needs a Helmsman," and the fields were filled with a joyous atmosphere. Class leader Zong Guangde said: We must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, actively participate in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and launch a fierce attack on all ghosts and snakes, answering the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's meticulous care with actual actions. Luo Yulan, a student from the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Department of Ningxia University and a daughter of a poor Hui farmer, said: The Party Central Committee's decision is great. In the past, I had tried various ways to ask people to help me buy Chairman Mao's works, but I never succeeded. Only a few days ago did I finally realize my wish. I was so happy that I hugged Chairman Mao's books to my chest, feeling warmth throughout my body, and tears of excitement welled up in my eyes. In the future, I will definitely read Chairman Mao's books better and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. The news reached Xinjiang, and Meng Qinglin, the deputy political instructor of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the Kailas Mountains on the border of our motherland for years, said: With Mao Zedong Thought in our minds, we can overcome all the difficulties in the highlands and defend the western gate of our motherland. The Tibetan farmers harvesting barley in the Lhasa River Valley heard the news and sang songs of excitement in the golden wheat fields. Awan Cairen, the Party branch secretary of Zhangzê Township in the eastern suburbs of Lhasa and a former serf, said excitedly: The Party and Chairman Mao have shown us, the million serfs of Tibet, deep affection like the sea. We will study hard and let the great Mao Zedong Thought shine even brighter on the Tibetan Plateau. Huang Quandao, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works and a Zhuang worker from the Timber Processing Plant of the Construction Engineering Bureau in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, said: The Party Central Committee's decision not only meets our workers' demand to study Chairman Mao's works but also gives the counter-revolutionary gang a hard blow. The news reached the foot of the Wuzhishan in Hainan Island, and many villagers from the Yunnan and Miao ethnic groups sang and danced, joyfully celebrating the Party Central Committee's wise decision.

According to Xinhua News Agency on the 10th, the publishing, printing, and distribution departments of Hubei, Shaanxi, Hunan, Zhejiang, Shandong, Jiangxi, Anhui, Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Yunnan, Henan, Changchun, Lanzhou, Lhasa, Xining, Yinchuan, Guiyang, and Fuzhou, along with the broad masses of workers from printing plants affiliated with the People's Liberation Army, have responded with great excitement to the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to accelerate the mass publication of Chairman Mao's works. They said, Chairman Mao's works are the most powerful spiritual atomic bombs. We will definitely print more, faster, better, and distribute Chairman Mao's works well, so that the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, as well as revolutionary intellectuals and revolutionary cadres, can better study Chairman Mao's works and hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Some provinces and cities' paper-making and postal departments have also taken revolutionary measures to ensure the production of the best paper for printing Chairman Mao's works and delivering Chairman Mao's works to the workers, peasants, and soldiers as quickly as possible.
