Sun Yefang's fallacies cannot deceive the poor and lower-middle peasants. Comrade-in-arms' mother, Rong Guanxiu.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class struggle, some classes triumph, some classes are eliminated. This is history, this is the history of civilization over several thousand years." Yet, Sun Yefang describes production relations as the relationship between "people" and "things," and says that the contradiction between "people" and "things" is the "most profound internal contradiction of the socialist economy." He is talking nonsense, viciously attacking Chairman Mao's theory on class and class struggle, faithfully promoting Khrushchev's revisionism, and attempting to overthrow the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's wise leadership to restore capitalism. Let me tell you, Sun Yefang, your schemes as a member of the black gang will never succeed! You will only end up like a dung beetle hitting a wall, making a few pitiful cries!

Countless facts prove that class struggle is a big issue. Whether before liberation or after liberation, production relations are relations between people, that is, class relations, and not some relationship between "people" and "things." We poor and lower-middle peasants have deeply experienced the bitterness of the old society and the sweetness of the new society. Therefore, we understand best the oppression of the classes, the class struggle, who to love and who to hate, and how to overthrow you black gang of counter-revolutionaries.

The laboring people who have deeply suffered in the old society will never forget the scars left by the class enemies on our bodies. Take our Pansong Village, for example. Before liberation, the thirteen villages with more than two thousand households here were exploited and oppressed by the landlords Han Gouyan and Han Lanyue. The land cultivated by more than two thousand households was less than one-fourth of the land owned by these two households. Every year, the grain we harvested had to be delivered to their granaries. Even if we cultivated a bit of wasteland on the hillsides, we had to pay half of it as rent. Picking up a stone was not allowed to be called our own. Every household could not even eat enough husks and vegetables throughout the year, and were forced to sell their children, separate families, and wander homeless. I myself moved from one village to another because I could not live in this village, and in half a lifetime, I moved three times, still suffering from cold and hunger. Even so, my parents were driven to think of suicide every few days. My uncle Rong Rongzi hanged himself several times and was saved by poor brothers. Finally, he took his entire family of five out to flee famine. Five or six days later, the entire family of five, except for one who was sold, all starved to death in the deep mountains. At that time, the world was as dark as a flock of crows, and there was no way out. Is the relationship between us poor and lower-middle peasants and Han Gouyan and Han Lanyue some relationship between "people" and "things"?

Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we poor and lower-middle peasants waged a heroic class struggle, overthrew the Kuomintang reactionaries, fought against the landlords and bullies, and obtained houses and land, thus standing up and becoming masters. If we had believed Sun Yefang's words, focusing only on the contradictions between "people" and "things" and not on class struggle, we would have been oppressed by the three big mountains generation after generation, and how could we have the good life we have today!

Then, is the production relationship in socialist society after liberation a relationship between "people" and "things"? Is there no class struggle? No. Take agricultural collectivization, for example. We poor and lower-middle peasants all know that collectivization is very good! Everyone says, "We have found the bright path to happiness and prosperity!" We work enthusiastically for the commune, aiming to produce more grain to build socialism. But what about the landlords and rich peasants? They are extremely hostile to collectivization, saying that collectivization is "ruined" and "collapsed." They not only do not work hard but also engage in various sabotage activities. We poor and lower-middle peasants educate our descendants not to forget their roots and to listen to the Party and Chairman Mao, to study hard and serve the people wholeheartedly. But the landlord and rich peasant families teach their children to remember that this room and that piece of land belonged to them in the past, and that it was the Communist Party and us poor people who "stole" them, and that they will settle accounts with us when they have the means. Is this some contradiction between "people" and "things"?

It is clear that it is under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao that we poor and lower-middle peasants, in the process of collectivization, waged class struggle, repelled the fierce attacks of the landlords and rich peasants, and achieved the great victory of the collectivization movement. If we had believed Sun Yefang's words, treating the production relations of socialist society as merely contradictions between "people" and "things," focusing only on production and not on class struggle, then the people's communes would not have been established, and even if they were established, they would collapse.

We deeply feel that every victory and every achievement is won through serious class struggle. Class struggle must never be forgotten!

Sun Yefang, you wicked man, viciously attacking Chairman Mao's theory on class and class struggle, attempting to lull the revolutionary people into complacency, restore capitalism, and push us poor and lower-middle peasants who have stood up back into the bitter sea of suffering, we will never allow it, and the people of the entire nation will never allow it. I will keep my eyes open, stand firm, and always educate our descendants to remember the bitterness of class struggle and never forget the blood debt. I will forever be a staunch warrior defending the dictatorship of the proletariat and Mao Zedong Thought. Whoever attacks the great Party Central Committee and Mao Zedong Thought, as long as I have a breath, I will fight to the end.

    孙冶方的谬论骗不了贫下中农
    子弟兵母亲　戎冠秀
    毛主席教导我们说：“阶级斗争，一些阶级胜利了，一些阶级消灭了。这就是历史，这就是几千年的文明史。”可是，孙冶方却把生产关系说成是“人”与“物”的关系，还说什么“人”与“物”的矛盾是“社会主义经济的最深远的内在矛盾”。他这是胡说八道，是恶毒地攻击毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的理论，忠实地推行赫鲁晓夫修正主义的主张，妄想推翻党中央和毛主席的英明领导，复辟资本主义。告诉你，孙冶方，你这个黑帮分子的鬼打算是永远不会得逞的！你只会像屎克螂碰在城墙上，“嗡嗡”发出几声惨叫罢了！
    无数事实证明，阶级斗争是个大问题。无论是在解放前还是在解放后，生产关系都是人与人的关系，也就是阶级关系，而绝不是什么“人”与“物”的关系。我们贫下中农深受旧社会的苦，深感新社会的甜。因此，我们也最懂得阶级压迫、阶级斗争，最懂得爱谁、恨谁，最懂得革你们这伙反革命黑帮的命。
    深受旧社会痛苦的劳动人民，是永远也不会忘记阶级敌人烙在我们身上的伤疤的。就拿我们盘松村来说吧，解放前，我们这里十三个村庄的二千多户人家，受着韩狗眼、韩腊月两户地主的剥削和压迫。二千多户人家种的地，还不到他们两户土地的四分之一。年年收入的粮食，都要交到他们的大仓里。我们就是在山坡上刨点荒地，也得交给人家一半租子，拿起一块石头也不敢说是自己的。家家户户一年到头连糠菜也吃不到头，被他们逼得卖儿卖女，妻离子散，流离失所。我自己在这个村生活不下去搬到那个村，半辈子搬了三次家，还是挨冻受饿。就是这样，父母亲被逼得三天两头想寻死。我的叔叔戎荣子上吊好几次，都被穷兄弟们救下来。最后，他带着全家五口外出逃荒。五、六天后，全家五口，除被卖的一人外，全都饿死在深山里了。那时，天下的老鸦一般黑，到哪里也没有活路。我们贫下中农与韩狗眼、韩腊月的关系，难道是什么“人”与“物”的关系吗？
    在党和毛主席的英明领导下，我们贫下中农进行了英勇的阶级斗争，打倒了国民党反动派，斗垮了地主、恶霸，分到了房屋、田地，才翻了身，当家作主。要是相信了孙冶方的话，只抓“人”与“物”的矛盾，不抓阶级斗争，我们就要世世代代被三座大山压在脚下，哪有今天的好日子！
    那末，解放以后，社会主义社会里的生产关系是不是就是“人”与“物”的关系了呢？是不是没有阶级斗争了呢？不是。就拿农业合作化来说吧，我们贫下中农谁不知道合作化好得很！大家都说：“咱们可找到了幸福美满的光明大道啦！”我们干劲十足地给社里干活，为的是多打粮食，好建设社会主义。可是地主、富农呢？他们却对合作化极端仇视，说什么合作化搞“糟”了，搞“垮”了。他们不仅不好好干活，还进行种种破坏活动。俺贫下中农教育自己的子孙，不要忘本，要听党和毛主席的话，好好学习，全心全意为人民服务。可是，地富人家教育自己的孩子，要记住这间房那块地过去是他们的，是共产党和俺穷人们“抢”走了，等以后有了办法跟俺们算账。这难道是什么“人”与“物”的矛盾吗？
    可见，我们贫下中农正是在党和毛主席的领导下，在合作化的过程中，进行了阶级斗争，打退了地主、富农的猖狂进攻，才取得了合作化运动的伟大胜利。要是相信了孙冶方的话，把社会主义社会的生产关系只看作是“人”与“物”的矛盾，只抓生产，不抓阶级斗争，那末，人民公社就建立不起来，就是建立了，也要垮台。
    我们深深地体会到，每一个胜利、每一点成绩的取得，都是要经过严重的阶级斗争的。阶级斗争是千万不能忘记的呀！
    孙冶方，你这个黑心的家伙，恶毒地攻击毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的理论，妄想麻痹革命人民的斗志，复辟资本主义，把我们翻了身的劳动人民重新推到水深火热的苦海中去，我们绝不答应，全国人民绝不答应。我要擦亮眼睛，站稳脚跟，还要时时刻刻教育我们的子子孙孙，牢记阶级苦，不忘血泪仇。我要永远当一名捍卫无产阶级专政、捍卫毛泽东思想的坚强战士。谁要攻击伟大的党中央和毛泽东思想，只要我还有一口气，就要跟他们拚到底。
