In response to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's great call to arms, the armed forces of South Vietnam have launched a series of successful attacks, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. In the past month, guerrilla forces across various regions have shot down more than twenty American aircraft.

	According to a report from the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, the armed forces in various regions of South Vietnam have responded to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's great call to arms, frequently launching attacks on the enemy and annihilating a large number of American and puppet troops.

	From August 6 to 13, the armed forces in Quang Nam Province bravely repelled a large-scale "sweeping" operation by nine battalions of puppet troops, three battalions of U.S. Marines, and three armored battalions against Giai Mountain County and the western part of Tam Ky County. They annihilated more than 1,100 enemy troops, including 425 American invaders, shot down and destroyed 18 enemy aircraft, and damaged six M-113 amphibious armored vehicles.

	From July 6 to August 5, the guerrilla forces in the counties of Bình Định Province, including Bình Sơn, Ba Trại, Sơn Hà, and Đức Phú, fought against the enemy's "sweeping" operations. They killed and wounded 335 enemy troops, including 224 American invaders, shot down five enemy aircraft, and destroyed seven military vehicles.

	From August 7 to 15, the guerrilla forces in Châu Thành County and Thừa Thiên County launched consecutive attacks on the enemy's "sweeping" operations in villages such as Hòa Đức and Yên Thạnh. They killed and wounded nearly 100 enemy troops, most of whom were American invaders, shot down two enemy aircraft, and damaged three M-113 amphibious armored vehicles.

	On the night of August 20, the armed forces in Dĩ An Province attacked an enemy stronghold in An Thạnh Village, An Biên County, annihilating all the commanding officers and two platoons of a puppet battalion.

	On August 13 and 14, the local forces in Gia Định Province's Gò Vấp County and Hóc Môn County consecutively intercepted a U.S. battalion conducting a "sweeping" operation near the village of Trung An, near Saigon. They annihilated 60 enemy troops and shot down two enemy aircraft.

	According to a report from the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, in the past month, guerrilla forces across various regions of South Vietnam have consecutively shot down more than twenty American warplanes using light weapons, once again exposing the myth of American "air superiority."

	In just four days, from August 3 to 6, the guerrilla forces in the counties of Quảng Nam, including Giai Mountain, Thăng Bình, and Tam Kỳ, shot down nine American helicopters using light weapons.

	On August 1, the guerrilla forces in Nghĩa Kiều Village, Tư Nghĩa County, Bình Định Province, shot down an enemy transport aircraft 100 meters away from the enemy's Bình Định airfield using light weapons, killing five puppet troops on board.
