The red sun rises from the east,
The light of the plenary session illuminates the five lakes and four seas;
The great Chinese Communist Party,
The great leader Chairman Mao,
Leads us from victory to victory!
In response to the great call of the plenary session, let us raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher;
In response to the great call of the plenary session, we will definitely carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end!

Members of the Cultural Work Team of the Inner Mongolia Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, who had just returned from their unit, joyfully sang this song, which they had composed overnight, as they beat drums and gongs through the streets, heading to the countryside, entering factories and units, enthusiastically propagating the communiqué of the Central Committee's plenary session to the broad revolutionary masses.

Members of various cultural work teams in the Inner Mongolia Military Region have studied the communiqué seriously. They said, "We are propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought. We must actively propagate the great call of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao to factories, the countryside, and units."

The third team of the Cultural Work Team is going to the suburbs of Hohhot to the Moji Camp Commune to propagate. The team members rehearsed more than ten short programs overnight, including "Hail the Communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee" and "Carry the Cultural Revolution Through to the End." To ensure that the broad poor and lower-middle peasants understand the propaganda content, team members Zhang Shizhong, Zeng Zhaoyu, and Zhao Yanyan specially studied the local dialect.

When the Cultural Work Team propagates the communiqué in factories, the countryside, and units, they are warmly welcomed by the broad revolutionary masses. They expressed that they will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and, with a revolutionary spirit, fully implement the great call of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee.

　　纵情歌唱毛主席
    火红的太阳，从东方升起，
    全会的光芒，照亮了五湖四海；
    伟大的中国共产党，
    伟大的领袖毛主席，
    领导我们从胜利走向胜利！
    响应全会的伟大号召，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗高举更高举；
    响应全会伟大号召，一定将文化大革命进行到底！
    刚刚从连队归来的中国人民解放军内蒙古军区文化工作队队员，纵情高唱着连夜创作的这支歌曲，敲锣打鼓地走上街头，奔向农村，深入工厂和连队，热情地向广大革命群众宣传党中央全会公报。
    内蒙古军区各个文化工作队的队员认真学习了公报，他们说，我们是毛泽东思想的宣传员，我们要最积极地把党中央和毛主席的伟大号召传到工厂、农村和连队。
    文化工作队第三队要到呼和浩特郊区的毫沁营公社去作宣传，队员们连夜赶排了《欢呼八届十一中全会公报》《把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底》等十多个短小的节目。为了使广大贫下中农听懂宣传内容，队员张世忠、曾昭玉、赵燕燕专门学习了当地群众的语言。
    文化工作队来到工厂、农村、连队宣传公报，受到广大革命群众的热烈欢迎。他们表示，一定要把毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得高高的，以革命的精神全力贯彻八届十一中全会的伟大号召。
