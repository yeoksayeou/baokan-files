	South Vietnam's Quang Tri Military and Civilians Achieve Another Great Victory, Annihilating Over a Thousand American Soldiers
	American Seven Battalions of Marines Are Beaten to a Pulp, Retreating in Disarray

	Xinhua News Agency, August 4th: Saigon News: The large-scale "sweeping" operation launched by the American aggressors on July 15th in the northern part of Quang Tri Province in South Vietnam has ended in failure after being fiercely counterattacked by the liberation armed forces for three days.

	According to Western news agencies, the seven battalions of American Marines participating in this "sweeping" operation were beaten to a pulp and retreated in disarray to Da Nang and Phu Bai on the 3rd. Since the start of the "sweeping" operation on July 15th, the American aggressors have been continuously attacked by the liberation armed forces and the people of Quang Tri Province, suffering heavy casualties.

	The Washington Post acknowledged helplessly in a report on the 1st that the Marine Corps suffered enormous casualties and heavy losses in this "sweeping" operation. "Many Marines believe that... the sacrifices made during the mission are too great."

	According to recent reports from the Liberation Radio of South Vietnam, by July 26th, the liberation armed forces had annihilated over a thousand American soldiers in the anti-"sweeping" operations in this region.

	According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on the 3rd, the Vietnam People's Army Newspaper published a commentary on the 2nd, celebrating the great victory of the military and civilians of Quang Tri Province in South Vietnam in smashing the recent large-scale "sweeping" operation launched by the American aggressors.

	The commentary pointed out that the American aggressors had made relatively "thorough" preparations for this "sweeping" operation. The commander of the U.S. forces in Vietnam, Westmoreland, personally went to Quang Tri Province on July 13th to "study the situation" and "review the action plan." Subsequently, the United States gathered a large number of Marine Corps personnel from bases in Thua Thien Province's Phu Bai, Quang Nam Province's Da Nang and Chu Lai, and the Seventh Fleet and threw them into this battlefield. It used B-52 strategic bombers for ruthless, continuous bombing. However, the United States failed to achieve its goal of annihilating the liberation armed forces. On the contrary, the more it fought, the more it lost, and it was forced to retreat with its remaining troops in defeat.

    南越广治军民又获大捷歼灭美军千余
    美国七个营海军陆战队被打得七零八落狼狈不堪
    新华社四日讯　西贡消息：美国侵略军七月十五日开始在越南南方广治省北部发动的一次大规模“扫荡”，在解放武装力量的英勇反击下，三日已经以失败而告终。
    据西方通讯社报道，参加这次“扫荡”的七个营的美国海军陆战队，被打得七零八落，狼狈不堪，三日开始灰溜溜地撤回到岘港和芙拜等地。从七月十五日开始“扫荡”以来，美国侵略军不断遭到广治省的解放武装力量和人民的袭击，伤亡惨重。
    美国《华盛顿邮报》一日在一篇报道中曾无可奈何地承认，美国海军陆战队在这次“扫荡”中死伤巨大，损失惨重。“许多海军陆战队都认为，……在执行任务时付出的牺牲太大了。”
    据越南南方解放通讯社最近报道，到七月二十六日为止，解放武装力量已经在这个地区的反“扫荡”中，消灭美军达一千人以上。
    据新华社河内三日电　越南《人民军队报》二日发表评论，欢呼越南南方广治省军民粉碎了美国侵略军最近发动的一次大规模“扫荡”的巨大胜利。
    评论指出，美国侵略者发动这次“扫荡”曾作了相当“周密”的准备。侵越美军司令威斯特摩兰七月十三日曾亲自到广治省“研究情况”和“批阅行动计划”。接着，美国从承天省的芙拜、广南省的岘港和朱莱等基地以及第七舰队搜罗大量美国海军陆战队员投入了这个战场。它使用B—52型战略轰炸机进行残酷的、连续的轰炸。但是，美国无法实现它消灭解放武装力量的目的，恰恰相反，它越打越输，被迫收拾残军败退。（附图片）
