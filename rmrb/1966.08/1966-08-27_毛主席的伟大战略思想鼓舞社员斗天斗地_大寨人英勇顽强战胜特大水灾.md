Now, Daqiao presents a new scene. Many ravines and terraces have turned from severe disasters into light disasters, and light disasters into no disasters. The crops on the slopes are better than any other year. Cadres and community members are pressing forward to achieve a bumper harvest.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, August 26th — Recently, the Daqiao Brigade of Daqiao Production Brigade in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, suffered a severe flood. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great strategic thought that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers, the heroic people of Daqiao, carrying forward the glorious tradition of self-reliance and hard struggle, and the fearless revolutionary spirit, bravely and tenaciously fought against natural disasters, striving for victory in both revolution and production, and achieving a bumper harvest in a disaster-stricken year.

This severe flood occurred on July 19th. That afternoon, within two and a half hours, the rainfall reached over 150 millimeters. Due to the sudden and heavy rain, water suddenly rose from the ground, and mountain torrents surged. Some stone dams were washed away, some terraces were destroyed, crops were severely flattened, and the damage was heavy. In summary, the damage to the land and crops caused by this flood was more severe than that in 1963.

After the disaster, the people of Daqiao held several meetings to study Chairman Mao's relevant instructions and discuss disaster relief. The people of Daqiao said: Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers, this is Chairman Mao's wise judgment. Under the guidance of this great strategic thought of Chairman Mao, we people of Daqiao are fearless of heaven and earth, dare to struggle, and dare to win. Chen Yonggui, the secretary of the Daqiao Brigade Party Branch, said: We are not afraid of imperialism and reactionaries, nor are we afraid of natural disasters. The greater the disaster, the higher our morale; the heavier the disaster, the harder our bones; the more disasters, the more methods we have.

As soon as the rain stopped, cadres and community members, carrying Chairman Mao's works, went to the front lines to fight against the flood. The entire brigade, old and young, men and women, rushed to repair the dams, drain water, and support the seedlings. They followed Chairman Mao's instructions, "With firm determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." Chen Yonggui's home had over a foot of water on the ground, but he did not bother to clean up. Day and night, he rushed from the dam to the fields, from the ravines to the slopes, working with everyone to repair dams, drain water, support seedlings, and apply fertilizer. To rush the repair of key stone dams, old hero Jia Jincai led his stone-cutting team to cut over 800 loads of stones in 20 days, meeting the urgent need for dam repair at that time. During the support of seedlings, the team leader Guo Fenglian and Jia Xiulan and other "Iron Girls" worked in the mud and water for several days in a row. Over 300 acres of corn submerged by water were supported by them in just four or five days. During the application of fertilizer, the "Iron Shoulders" Liang Bianliang and Brigade Leader Jia Chengran carried fertilizer, one load for two; the women's team leader Song Liying led the women community members to apply fertilizer quickly, carefully, and well.

Chairman Mao said: The Yangtze River, everyone says it is very big, but actually, big is not scary. Isn't American imperialism very big? We pushed it a bit, and it's nothing. Therefore, some big things in the world are actually not scary. The people of Daqiao drew great spiritual strength from this speech of Chairman Mao. They said, the Yangtze River is big, but it's not scary; American imperialism is big, but it's not scary; natural disasters are big, but they are even less scary. Cadres and community members unanimously expressed that they would learn from Chairman Mao's fearless revolutionary daring and revolutionary optimism, bravely overcoming the severe disaster.

The people of Daqiao, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, not only dare to struggle but also know how to struggle. They organized male community members to build dams, repair breaches, and strengthen key projects; female community members to transplant, weed, and move seedlings, weeding while applying fertilizer; the children wearing red scarves also participated in the rush to support seedlings. They seized every second, every inch of land, and every seedling, determined to seize a bumper harvest from the "mud dragon's mouth," support national construction, and support the world revolution.

The Daqiao Brigade also seriously summarized the experience and lessons from previous years' disasters, especially this severe flood, starting from the fundamental prevention of droughts and floods, formulated a comprehensive plan for future mountain and water conservation, preparing to further build a higher standard of drought-resistant and flood-resistant, stable and high-yielding "Daqiao Fields."

After suffering a severe flood, the Daqiao Brigade received warm concern from all sides. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the North China Bureau of the Communist Party of China, and the provincial, municipal, and county committees all sent people to visit them, and various places sent thousands of letters of condolence. This greatly encouraged the cadres and community members of Daqiao.

Now, the anti-disaster struggle of the people of Daqiao has achieved great results. Many ravines and terraces have turned from severe disasters into light disasters, and some plots have turned from light disasters into no disasters, presenting a new scene. Even more pleasing is that the crops on the slopes, looking from afar, are tall and sturdy, black and green, better than any other year. Thus, the disaster-stricken areas will have a small reduction in production, and the good areas will have a large increase in production. As long as there are no more major natural disasters, achieving a bumper harvest is possible. Under this favorable situation, the people of Daqiao unanimously guarantee to endure hardships, exert great efforts, and strive for greater victories to respond to the concern and expectations of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the people of the whole country.

    毛主席的伟大战略思想鼓舞社员斗天斗地
    大寨人英勇顽强战胜特大水灾
    现在，大寨一派新景象。不少沟坝地重灾变轻灾，轻灾变无灾，坡梁地的庄稼好过任何一年。干部社员正乘胜前进夺取大丰收
    据新华社太原二十六日电　山西省昔阳县大寨公社大寨大队不久以前又遭受了一场特大的洪灾。英雄的大寨人，在毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的伟大战略思想指导下，发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的光荣传统和大无畏的革命精神，英勇顽强地同自然灾害作斗争，力争革命、生产双胜利，大灾之年夺丰收。
    这次特大洪灾，发生在七月十九日。那天下午，在两个半小时内降雨量达一百五十多毫米，因雨过急过大，顿时平地起水，山洪暴发。冲塌了一些石坝，冲垮了一些地堾，农作物严重倒伏，受灾很重。总之，这次洪灾对土地和农作物造成的损失，比一九六三年还要重。
    灾后，大寨人接连召开了各种会议，学习毛主席的有关教导，讨论救灾问题。大寨人说：帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎，这是毛主席的英明论断。在毛主席这一伟大战略思想的指导下，我们大寨人天不怕、地不怕，敢于斗争，敢于胜利。大寨大队党支部书记陈永贵说：我们不怕帝国主义和反动派，也不怕自然灾害。灾害越大，我们志气越高；灾害越重，我们骨头越硬；灾害越多，我们办法越多。
    暴雨一停，干部和社员们就带着毛主席著作上阵，同洪灾展开搏斗。全队男女老少一齐出动，抢修洪坝，排水扶苗，移栽补种。他们遵照毛主席的指示，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”陈永贵家里地面积了一尺多深的水，他顾不得收拾，日日夜夜从坝上忙到地里，从沟里干到梁上，和大家一起修坝、排水、扶苗、追肥。为了赶修重点石坝，老英雄贾进财带领他的打石头组，二十天时间就突击打石头八百多抬，满足了当时修坝需要。扶苗中，团支部书记郭凤莲和贾秀兰等“铁姑娘”们，一连好几天钻在泥里水里干。三百多亩被水淤没的玉米，她们突击四五天时间就扶完了。追肥的时候，“铁肩膀”梁变良、大队长贾承让等担运肥料都是一担顶两担；妇女队长宋立英领导的妇女社员更是追得快，追得细，追得好。
    毛主席说：长江，别人都说很大，其实，大，并不可怕。美帝国主义不是很大吗？我们顶了他一下，也没有啥。所以，世界上有些大的东西，其实并不可怕。大寨人从毛主席的这段话中获得了巨大的精神力量。他们说，长江大，不可怕；美帝国主义大，不可怕；自然灾害大，更不可怕。干部和社员一致表示，要学习毛主席大无畏的革命胆略和革命乐观主义精神，奋勇战胜特大灾害。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的大寨人，不但敢于斗争，而且善于斗争。他们按照毛主席关于在战术上重视敌人的教导，组织了男社员打坝、整缺口、加固关键工程；女社员间苗、锄苗、移苗，边锄苗，边追肥；带红领巾的孩子们也参加了突击扶苗活动。他们分秒必争，寸土必种，株苗必保，决心从“泥龙口”夺取大丰收，支援国家建设，支援世界革命。
    大寨大队还认真总结了历年遭灾、特别是这次特大洪灾的经验教训，从根本上防旱防洪出发，制定了今后全面综合治山治水的计划，准备进一步建设更高标准的旱涝保收、稳产高产的“大寨田”。
    大寨大队遭受特大洪灾后，受到了各方面的热情关怀。中共中央、中共中央华北局和省、地、县委都派人慰问他们，各地寄来了数以千计的慰问信。这使大寨的干部和社员们受到极大的鼓舞。
    现在，大寨人的抗灾斗争，已经取得很大成绩。不少沟坝地已经由重灾变轻灾，有的地块已经由轻灾变无灾，呈现一派新的景象。尤为喜人的是坡梁地上的庄稼，一眼望去，又高又粗，又黑又绿，比任何一年都长得好。这样，灾地小减产，好地大增产，只要不再受大的自然灾害，夺取大丰收是可能的。在这种大好形势下，大寨人一致保证，要耐大苦，出大力，劲上加劲，乘胜前进，决心争取更大的胜利来回答党中央、毛主席和全国人民对他们的关怀和期望。（附图片）
