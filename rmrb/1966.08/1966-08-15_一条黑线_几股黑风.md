The Lu Ping clique has vigorously promoted "peaceful evolution" in the realms of ideology, culture, and daily life, stirring up "several black winds" that have poisoned the minds of many students.

Head down in books, indifferent to political winds

At a welcoming ceremony on September 16, 1961, Lu Ping openly declared: "Being red without expertise is an empty politician. Redness must be practical, not hollow, and must be demonstrated. It must be demonstrated through diligent study. For students, this means studying hard and delving deep into their subjects. Criticizing the tendency to neglect politics is not the same as opposing the pursuit of expertise. How can a university student not study? This is not about the 'white expert' path." After this, Lu Ping repeatedly emphasized, "In 1958, there was too much labor; now we must emphasize studying hard," and "Students must study hard for ten thousand years!" Lu Ping's intentions were extremely malicious. He talked only about studying and not about politics, aiming to lead students down the capitalist road of detaching from politics, reality, and the masses, advocating for "ears that do not hear the world's affairs and a heart that only reads the classics."

A chaotic curriculum and heavy workloads left students breathless. Students' daily lives were reduced to "dormitory—canteen—library." For a long time, both teachers and students were swept up in a black wind of prioritizing expertise over politics, burying their heads in books, and ignoring politics. Many were poisoned and led astray.

Visiting bourgeois "professors" wind

The Lu Ping clique elevated bourgeois "scholars," "authorities," and "ancestors" to the heavens. They encouraged youth to "boldly" learn from bourgeois "scholars" and "authorities."

With the support and encouragement of the Lu Ping clique, bourgeois "scholars" and "professors" extended their reach far and wide. They invited students to "visit," using the guise of sharing "scholarly experiences" to corrupt and seduce the youth. Some bourgeois professors even held "family exhibitions," openly advocating for individual struggle and personal success.

Reading bourgeois literary works wind

Since 1961, the Lu Ping clique, under the pretext of "inheriting cultural legacies" and "allowing students to read negative examples to build immunity," peddled a large amount of bourgeois, feudal, and revisionist literary works to the youth.

At that time, the "literary book lending section" had nine shelves, with seven shelves filled with bourgeois, feudal, and revisionist literary works. Simultaneously, the Lu Ping clique in the liberal arts department used "lectures" to heavily promote Western bourgeois literary works. Therefore, reading Soviet revisionist and Western bourgeois literary works became fashionable. Novels like "Red and Black," "Pride and Prejudice," and "Quiet Flows the Don" circulated widely among students. The reactionary and decadent ideas of individual struggle, personal success, and love above all else, as propagated in bourgeois and revisionist literary works, severely corrupted the minds of many students.

Bourgeois "authorities" lecturing wind

With the support of the Lu Ping clique, bourgeois "scholars" and "authorities" emerged one after another, stirring up a black wind of bourgeois "authorities" lecturing in the school. They allowed reactionary literati to hold toolbook lectures, invited bourgeois "authorities" to lecture on "Yan Garden history," and let the "ancestors" of bourgeois reactionary philosophy extensively propagate Confucius's ideas of "benevolence." They invited the anti-communist veteran Wu Han to lecture on how to evaluate historical figures and invited so-called "Redology experts" to lecture on how to appreciate "Dream of the Red Chamber," and so on.

Showing bad movies wind

In the realm of cultural life, alongside the black wind of dancing with the opposite sex, another black wind was blowing—showing yellow movies. For a considerable period, the films shown on campus were mainly from Hong Kong, Western bourgeois countries, Soviet revisionists, and Chinese films from the "1930s." They showed revisionist films without organizing students to criticize them. For revolutionary films, the Lu Ping clique did everything possible to resist, rarely showing them, and even when they did, it was only one showing. Many students who wanted to watch them couldn't.

　　一条黑线　几股黑风
    陆平黑帮在思想、文化、生活等领域内大力推行“和平演变”，刮起了“几股黑风”，使不少同学的心灵受到毒害。
    埋头读书，不问政治风
    陆平在一九六一年九月十六日的迎新会上公开叫嚷：“只红不专是空头的政治家。红必须落实，不能空洞，要有所表现。要在钻研业务方面体现出来，对学生来说，就是刻苦读书、刻苦钻研。批评忽视政治的倾向不等于是反对钻研业务。作为一个大学生不读书怎么行！这不叫什么白专道路。”在这以后，陆平还大叫大嚷什么“五八年劳动多了，现在就是要强调发奋读书”，“是学生，一万年也要发奋读书！”陆平的用心是十分险恶的，他只谈读书，不讲政治，其目的就是要把学生引向“两耳不闻天下事，一心攻读圣贤书”的脱离政治、脱离实际、脱离群众的资产阶级道路上去。
    庞杂的课程，繁重的作业，压得学生气都喘不过来。学生每天的生活就是：“宿舍——食堂——图书馆”，所以，在一段很长的时间里，在师生中间出现了一股重业务、轻政治，埋头读书、不问政治的黑风，使不少人受到毒害，走上歧路。
    拜访资产阶级“教授”风
    陆平黑帮把资产阶级的“学者”、“权威”、“祖师爷”捧上了天。他要青年“厚着脸皮”向资产阶级“学者”、“权威”学习。
    在陆平黑帮的鼓励支持下，资产阶级“学者”、“教授”把手伸得老长老长。他们以邀请学生“作客”、介绍“治学经验”为名，拉拢腐蚀青年。一些资产阶级教授竟大办“家庭展览会”，用现身说法，明目张胆地鼓吹个人奋斗，成名成家。
    阅读资产阶级文学作品风
    自一九六一年以来，陆平黑帮在“继承中外文化遗产”、“让学生看一些反面东西增强免疫力”的幌子下，向青年兜售了大量资产阶级、封建主义和修正主义的文学作品。
    当时，“文艺书籍出纳处”有九架书，资产阶级、封建主义、修正主义的文学作品竟占了七架之多。同时，陆平黑帮在文科系还利用“讲坛”，向同学大力推荐西方资产阶级的文学作品。因此，阅读苏联修正主义和西方资产阶级文学作品，曾风行一时。象《红与黑》、《傲慢与偏见》、《静静的顿河》等西方资产阶级、苏联修正主义小说在同学中广为流传，资产阶级、修正主义文学作品中所宣扬的个人奋斗、成名成家、爱情至上等反动、腐朽思想，严重地摧残了许多同学的心灵。
    资产阶级“权威”讲学风
    在陆平黑帮的支持下，资产阶级“学者”、“权威”纷纷出笼，在学校里刮起了一股资产阶级“权威”讲学的黑风，让反动文人大办工具书讲座，请资产阶级“权威”大讲“燕园史话”，让资产阶级反动哲学的“祖师爷”大肆宣扬孔子“仁”的思想，由反共老手吴晗来校大讲如何评价历史人物，让所谓“红学专家”来校大讲如何欣赏《红楼梦》等等。
    大演坏电影风
    在文化生活领域内，同跳交际舞这股黑风同时刮着的另一股黑风，便是大演黄色电影风。一段相当长的时间里，活跃在学校银幕上的是香港影片，西方资产阶级国家影片，苏联修正主义影片和中国“三十年代”影片。放了修正主义的电影，也不组织同学批判。对于革命的影片，陆平黑帮就千方百计地加以抵制，平常很少放映，即便放映了，最多也是一场，很多同学想看也看不上。
