We Red Guards are the reserve forces of the PLA!
We Red Guards love the PLA the most and learn from the PLA the most!
We Red Guards, from the moment of our birth, have stood firmly with the PLA!
We Red Guards must take the PLA as our model to be worthy of being Chairman Mao's Red Guards!
Many of us were born in the years of war, with smoke and gunfire above our heads and shell craters beneath our feet. Surrounding us were PLA uncles, and holding us were PLA aunts!

Many of us grew up in the PLA, with the PLA's horses carrying us on marches, and the PLA's rations nourishing our growth.
We are inseparable from the PLA; the PLA is our best example!
The PLA serves the people wholeheartedly; the PLA maintains close ties with the masses, humbly learning from them; the PLA always comes from the masses and goes to the masses; the PLA is always the faithful servant of the people. In a word, the PLA always listens to Chairman Mao, is always loyal to the Party, to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to the people's revolutionary cause.

Red Guards should be PLA soldiers without guns! Red Guards must learn from the PLA! The style of the PLA should be the style of the Red Guards; the thoughts of the PLA should be the thoughts of the Red Guards!

Red Guards love the heroes of the PLA the most. Dong Cunrui, Huang Jiguang, Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Liu Yingjun, have always been in our hearts. Red Guards must be like Mai Xiande, following Chairman Mao through storms and waves to grow better; Red Guards must be like Wang Jie and Lei Feng, defending Mao Zedong Thought, and revolutionizing for life!

Red Guards must learn from the PLA to dare to struggle, dare to revolutionize; to be good at struggling, good at revolutionizing. This is the style of the PLA, and we Red Guards should inherit it!

The PLA values policy the most, and Red Guards must value policy the most. The Sixteen Points say: use cultural struggle, not armed struggle. Regarding the Party's policy, Red Guards must firmly defend and execute it! Truth is in the hands of the Red Guards, Mao Zedong Thought is in the hands of the Red Guards. As long as we use cultural struggle, we can thoroughly expose all the ghosts and monsters; we can thoroughly uproot all the revisionist roots; we can struggle them down, struggle them to ruin, struggle them to stink. Against those active counter-revolutionaries, against those who brazenly attack the Red Guards, the Red Guards will firmly suppress them, showing no mercy!

Red Guards who learn Mao Zedong Thought like the PLA are the true Red Guards!
Red Guards who have the three-eight style of the PLA are the true Red Guards!
Red Guards who execute policy like the PLA are the true Red Guards!
Red Guards who have the revolutionary thoughts of the PLA are the true Red Guards!

Red Guards, forever protect Chairman Mao!
Red Guards, forever learn from the PLA!

    红卫兵永远学习解放军
    我们红卫兵，就是解放军的后备兵！
    我们红卫兵，最爱解放军，也最爱学解放军！
    我们红卫兵，从诞生起就紧紧和解放军站在一起！
    我们红卫兵要以解放军为榜样，才配做毛主席的红卫兵！
    我们很多人，出生在烽火连天的战争年月，他们的头上，硝烟弥漫；他们的身下，弹坑遍地；围着他们的，是解放军叔叔；抱着他们的，是解放军阿姨！
    我们很多人，在解放军中长大，驮着他们行军的是解放军的战马，哺育他们成长的是解放军的食粮。
    我们和解放军不可分离，解放军就是我们最好的榜样！
    解放军，全心全意为人民服务；解放军，密切联系群众，虚心向群众学习；解放军，永远从群众中来，到群众中去；解放军，永远做人民的忠实的勤务员。一句话，解放军最听毛主席的话，永远忠于党、忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于人民革命事业。
    红卫兵就应该是不拿枪的解放军！红卫兵就是要学习解放军！解放军的作风，就该是红卫兵的作风；解放军的思想，就该是红卫兵的思想！
    红卫兵最热爱解放军的英雄。董存瑞、黄继光、雷锋、王杰、刘英俊，一直活在我们红卫兵心中。红卫兵，就要像麦贤得，跟着毛主席在大风大浪中锻炼，更好地成长；红卫兵，要像王杰、雷锋，捍卫毛泽东思想，干一辈子革命！
    红卫兵要学解放军，敢于斗争，敢于革命；善于斗争，善于革命。这是解放军的作风，我们红卫兵应该继承！
    解放军最讲政策，红卫兵也要最讲政策。十六条说：要用文斗，不用武斗。对党的政策，红卫兵，就要坚决捍卫，坚决执行！真理在红卫兵手里，毛泽东思想在红卫兵手里。我们只要文斗，就足以把一切牛鬼蛇神彻底揭露；就足以把一切修正主义根子彻底挖掉；我们只要文斗，就足以把它们斗倒、斗垮、斗臭。对于那些现行反革命分子，对于向红卫兵猖狂进攻的人，红卫兵坚决镇压，决不留情！
    像解放军一样学习毛泽东思想的红卫兵，才是真正的红卫兵！
    有解放军三八作风的红卫兵，才是真正的红卫兵！
    像解放军一样执行政策的红卫兵，才是真正的红卫兵！
    有解放军革命化思想的红卫兵，才是真正的红卫兵！
    红卫兵，永远保卫毛主席！
    红卫兵，永远学习解放军！
