At the mass rally held in the capital today to welcome friends who uphold the glorious tradition of the global movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs, anti-imperialist fighters from 14 countries and regions on five continents emphasized that the people of all countries in the world must further establish the broadest international united front to oppose imperialism headed by the United States and its lackeys, and carry the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism through to the end. They pointed out that to oppose imperialism, one must oppose modern revisionism headed by the Soviet leadership, and combine these two struggles.

Our great leader Chairman Mao and the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought received fervent praise once again at today's rally from foreign friends. Some international anti-imperialist fighters said, "Chairman Mao and the Chinese people led by the Communist Party of China are the vanguard and pathfinders in the global struggle for peace and national independence." Others said, "Guiding us is the profound and clear thought of the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Mao Zedong," and "Mao Zedong Thought is an all-powerful weapon." Many foreign friends ended their speeches by enthusiastically shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live the victory of Mao Zedong Thought throughout the world!"

The anti-imperialist fighters from 14 countries and regions are representatives from various countries who recently withdrew from the 12th World Conference to Ban the Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs. Their speeches at the capital's mass rally were met with extremely enthusiastic applause.

Australian friend William Morro, in his speech, condemned the splitist behavior of the leaders of the Japanese Council for the Abolition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs. He said, "We cannot speak of any unity with an organization that colludes with splitists and helps to establish a splitist organization like the National Conference to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, because some members of this organization are in one way or another colluding with imperialists." He said, "Some leaders of the Japanese Council for the Abolition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs are gradually leaning towards the reactionaries, and we cannot participate in any of their despicable actions."

Morro said, "We express our deep gratitude to the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao for their great foresight and for their sincere, complete, and correct guidance and leadership in the cause of world revolution. We also thank the Chinese people for their outstanding performance in the cause of peace."

Botswana friend Maphefiane condemned those who controlled this Tokyo conference for betraying the glorious tradition of the global movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs. He said, "The World Federation of Democratic Youth is a revisionist group. It has colluded with U.S. imperialism on more than one occasion, thus becoming its accomplice. Under these circumstances, foreign representatives cannot include this organization in the international united front against U.S. imperialism, nor can they take any 'joint action' with them."

He said, "Any opinion advocating 'joint action' with the World Federation of Democratic Youth can only be a conspiracy to deceive the peoples of all countries, helping them to cover up the traitorous faces of those who pretend to be anti-imperialist but are actually surrendering, who pretend to support but are actually betraying the united front, who pretend to be united but are actually splitist."

In conclusion, he shouted, "Down with U.S. imperialism and all its disguised tools! Down with all troublemakers and splitists!"

Bechuanaland friend Setchele enthusiastically praised the Chinese people for continuing their struggle under the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. He praised the Chinese people for firmly supporting the struggle of the Vietnamese people and the revolutionary peoples of all countries, and expressed that the people of Bechuanaland firmly support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression.

He said, "Some leaders of the Japanese Council for the Abolition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs this time betrayed the Japanese people, joining the infamous chorus of those who advocate peace at any cost. Those people, under the pretext of 'joint action,' actually harbor the sinister goal of sharing the spoils with imperialism to jointly dominate the world." He said, "Since the leaders of this Tokyo conference have fallen into the abyss of revisionism and betrayed the Japanese people, our withdrawal from this conference can only be beneficial to the Japanese people, with no harm."

He stressed, "We refuse and oppose participating in the evil activities of selling out the peoples of the world, especially the Japanese people's revolution. We are confident that the Japanese people will not allow this situation to continue."

Belgian friend Dupire pointed out that we cannot speak of unity with those who are closely connected with the main enemy of the peoples of all countries—U.S. imperialism. The genuine international united front against U.S. imperialism cannot include Soviet opportunists and their accomplices. The genuine international united front must be directed against both U.S. imperialism and the Soviet leadership group that serves U.S. imperialism, as well as its allies and followers.

He said, "Whether in the struggle to expel the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or in various activities to support the heroic fighters of Vietnam and the patriots of Congo, we place great importance on exposing the disguised agents of the number one enemy of the peoples of all countries, U.S. imperialism."

He said, "In our struggle, the great People's Republic of China has always stood firmly with us. The great People's Republic of China is an impregnable fortress established by the glorious Communist Party of China under the brilliant leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong."

He said, "Relying on a genuine, broad international united front against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, the peoples of the world will surely defeat the U.S. aggressors. U.S. imperialism and its revisionist satellites will inevitably be defeated."

Brazilian friend Galliano strongly condemned U.S. imperialism for turning Brazil into a new type of colony and a massive military base for invading other Latin American brother peoples. He said, "This cruel and painful reality has taught us a valuable lesson: we have learned to distinguish between friends and enemies, between true and false revolutionaries." He said, "The Brazilian people will never surrender under pressure. We are prepared for a long and arduous struggle. We are prepared for a people's war, which is the only correct path to victory."

Galliano pointed out that to achieve victory, we must have the broadest international anti-imperialist united front. However, this must be a genuine, real, and practical united front that does not include the accomplices, lackeys, and puppets of U.S. imperialism. This united front cannot include any representatives of the current Soviet revisionist leadership who have betrayed the peoples of all countries. This is a fundamental principle, and if we want to win, we must never deviate from this principle.

He said, "We are entering an era of complete victory over imperialism, colonialism, and neo-colonialism headed by U.S. imperialism, as well as all their agents, accomplices, lackeys, and puppets. Our victory is inevitable, and a new world for humanity will emerge from this."

He concluded his speech by shouting, "Long live the victory of Mao Zedong Thought throughout the world!"

Ceylonese friend Mututantri said that the international anti-U.S. united front must not include the accomplices of U.S. imperialism, the modern revisionists, nor can it take any "joint action" with them. We revolutionaries refuse to use the names of the Vietnamese people and the Japanese people to stage a fraud under the false banner of unity, thus defaming the heroic Vietnamese people and the brave anti-imperialist masses of Japan. We will never be silent witnesses or active participants in deliberate betrayal.

He said, "We cannot sit with our acknowledged enemies and pretend to be friendly with them. On issues involving revolutionary truth, we must never make any compromises at any time."

He concluded by shouting, "Long live the Communist Party of China and its beloved leader Chairman Mao Zedong!"

Chilean friend Barros emphasized in his speech that the Soviet revisionist leaders are making various agreements with the United States. They have reached an understanding with the United States in Europe and recently colluded with Japanese militarism to jointly oppose the revolution of the Asian peoples and the struggle of the Vietnamese people. They wear the mask of "aiding Vietnam" and plot to sell out the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people through the U.S.'s "peace talks." How can we unite with these people? How can we revolutionaries take "joint action" with those who have long been taking "joint action" with the butchers of the world?

He pointed out that to fight and defeat U.S. imperialism, it is absolutely necessary and inevitable to oppose modern revisionism and its open and hidden agents. This is a matter of principle. We will not compromise on matters of principle.

He said, "We must be more united than ever, forming the broadest and purest united front against U.S. imperialism and its various lackeys."

He concluded by shouting, "Long live the great Chinese people and their highest leader, Comrade Mao Zedong!"

Colombian friend Samper said that in our era, in the era of the revolution of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, Mao Zedong Thought is an all-powerful weapon. This weapon is not only being wielded by the Chinese people but also by an increasing number of fighters from all countries and peoples of the world, who skillfully use this weapon to achieve their own victories.

He said, "The representatives of 16 countries, more than 30 in total, firmly remembered Chairman Mao's judgment that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers, and that atomic bombs are also paper tigers used by U.S. imperialism to scare people. They upheld the correct stance of the peoples of all countries in the struggle against nuclear weapons, against nuclear blackmail, and against the reactionary monopoly of such weapons."

He said, "We formed a combative united front at this Tokyo conference, excluding the agents of the Soviet revisionist traitor group and the accomplices and accomplices of U.S. imperialism. We are all united as one, holding high the great banner of anti-U.S., anti-revisionism, and anti-reactionaries, struggling for the victory of the Vietnamese people's war and the liberation of all oppressed peoples and nations."

New Zealand friend Goddard said that the peoples of the world are increasingly recognizing who the culprits are in the aggression against the peace-loving peoples of all countries. In Vietnam, it is the United States that is responsible for the most barbaric war in history, as it completely destroyed the 1954 Geneva Agreement. She said, "We have the responsibility to tell the peoples of all countries about the glorious struggle that the Vietnamese people have been waging for independence for many years, and we will never allow the Vietnamese people to be sold out."

She said, "We cannot participate in the so-called 'negotiations' on the Vietnamese issue, no matter where they come from. We cannot unite with those who lack the determination to carry the struggle against U.S. imperialism through to the end. We cannot cooperate with those who close their eyes to nuclear blackmail when someone uses nuclear power to blackmail the world, but when those threatened take steps to defend themselves, they raise their hands in terror."

Goddard stressed, "Chairman Mao and the Chinese people led by the Communist Party of China are the vanguard and pathfinders in the global struggle for peace and national independence." She concluded her speech by shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Communist Party of China!"

Panamanian friend Menendez said, "We are experiencing a decisive moment. Imperialism headed by U.S. imperialism has been negated by history, and now it only needs a final blow to attend its funeral. The peoples of all countries, all revolutionaries, and all righteous people, under the brilliant and profound guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong, should join forces to deliver a fatal blow to the imperialist rule on Earth."

He pointed out that the modern revisionist group led by the Soviet leaders has become the last spiritual and political pillar of imperialism. We cannot sit at the same table or drink from the same cup with the revisionists.

He stressed, "The unity we advocate is based on the correct interpretation of the issues of war and peace. In this regard, the powerful, revolutionary, and anti-revisionist thought of Mao Zedong supports us in executing the correct anti-imperialist line. The unity we advocate is the unity of revolutionaries around the world who are prepared to eliminate imperialism to achieve lasting peace. We firmly denounce the conspiracies of the revisionists, who want to delay this historic struggle and the decisive battle of the peoples of all countries for happiness, so we cannot sit with them in the same hall."

Menendez concluded with revolutionary passion, "We have won in front of the world's masses because guiding us is the profound and clear thought of the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Mao Zedong."

South West African friend Kazonga enthusiastically pointed out that the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people led by Chairman Mao Zedong have stood firmly with us in the common struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism, which gives great strength and inspiration to the revolutionary peoples of our countries who are oppressed.

He said, "To best serve the anti-imperialist cause and to support the Japanese people's struggle against imperialism and revisionism, we refuse to have any relationship with the political dealings of some leaders of the Japanese Council for the Abolition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs."

He pointed out, "The struggle for peace is a part of the struggle against imperialism and for national liberation. On this issue, two paths and two lines are presented to the peoples of the world: the revolutionary path and line and the counter-revolutionary path and line. Our dividing line with the forces of revisionism is here."

He cited numerous examples to refute the shameless lies of the Soviet revisionist group that imperialism's nature has changed. He pointed out that imperialism's nature will not change, and U.S. imperialism will not abandon its policy of war. We must direct our struggle against U.S. imperialism and its accomplices, constantly exposing them, and isolating them in various ways. The revolutionary struggle to overthrow imperialism is the only path to lasting peace.

He stressed, "All those who cherish peace and care about strengthening the struggle for peace must never take 'joint action' with the revisionists. We will continue to combine the struggle against imperialism with the struggle against modern revisionism."

Sudanese friend Kair in his speech said, "We have taken and continue to take the same position: opposing all war and aggression forces headed by U.S. imperialism, and at the same time, we must oppose the new and old splitists and revisionists centered on the Soviet modern revisionist leadership group. In the struggle for peace, we have not changed our basic position. Facts have proven that our principled position and attitude are correct."

Kair condemned the "joint action" taken by some leaders of the Japanese Council for the Abolition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and the splitists. He said, "We want to tell them that a genuine broad united front against U.S. imperialism, under any circumstances, cannot include the accomplices and defenders of U.S. imperialism, that is, Soviet modern revisionism and its followers. Our broad united front is genuine, not hypocritical."

Kair refuted the slander of the leaders of the Japanese "Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs" against the representatives who withdrew from the conference. He said, "No conspiracy of the reactionaries, no trick of the modern revisionists, no reactionary force in the world can destroy the solid unity between us and the broad masses of Japanese peace fighters forged in the fiery struggle for true independence and peace. This unity will be further strengthened in the common struggle to defeat imperialism and revisionism and achieve liberation and lasting peace."

Swazi friend Nkosi said, "The struggle we waged at the Tokyo conference is a struggle between the progressive, anti-imperialist, revolutionary line and the revisionist line. This struggle is a matter of principle, a matter of adhering to the general line of correct policies aimed at liberating humanity. Some leaders of the Japanese Council for the Abolition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs have become tools of modern revisionism."

He condemned the splitists who are vigorously sabotaging the just struggle of the oppressed peoples, especially the just struggle of the Vietnamese brothers. He said, "We would rather sacrifice ourselves in the struggle than continue to live as slaves and guinea pigs of U.S. imperialism." He said, "The Vietnamese people will surely win, and they will forever drive out imperialism and its accomplices from Vietnam."

He said, "After briefly analyzing the Tokyo conference, we reached a conclusion, that is, as our era's famous leader Chairman Mao Zedong said: 'Who is our enemy? Who is our friend? This is the primary question of the revolution.'"

He said, "For the victory of our common struggle against world imperialism and revisionism, all genuine revolutionaries must unite firmly, support each other, and cooperate closely. He said, "The roar of world revolutionaries can be heard everywhere, and whoever tries to block this giant wave will perish."

He concluded his speech by shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

American friend Hawkins first enthusiastically praised the extraordinary achievements of the Chinese revolution under Chairman Mao's leadership. He said, "What we have seen so far has convinced us that China is faithful to revolutionary principles, and this is achieved under the brave and wise leadership of Chairman Mao." He said, "The example set by the Chinese people is a beacon for countless other nations struggling against the insidious and malicious influence of imperialism."

Hawkins, on behalf of the American people fighting against U.S. imperialism, paid tribute to the Chinese people. He confidently pointed out that imperialism is doomed to fail, and material wealth and nuclear weapons cannot save it. Let us unite to oppose reactionary imperialism, wherever it may be. Let us never compromise with those who may become agents of imperialism.

The speeches of the anti-imperialist fighters from various countries stirred up wave after wave of enthusiastic applause in the venue.

　　十四个国家和地区反帝战士在首都万人欢迎大会上讲话
　　赞颂毛泽东思想是万能的武器
　　必须把反帝反修斗争进行到底
    新华社十二日讯　在首都今天召开的欢迎维护禁止原子弹氢弹世界运动光荣传统的各国朋友的万人大会上，来自世界五大洲十四个国家和地区的反帝战士强调，全世界各国人民一定要进一步建立反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗的最广泛的国际统一战线，把反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的斗争进行到底。他们指出，要反对帝国主义必须反对以苏联领导集团为首的修正主义，并且把这两个斗争结合起来。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席和伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，在今天的大会上又一次受到外国朋友们的热烈赞颂。有的国际反帝战士说，“毛主席和中国共产党领导下的中国人民是全世界争取和平与民族独立斗争的先锋和带路人”。有的说，“指导我们的是我们时代最杰出的马列主义者毛泽东的深刻而又明确的思想”，“毛泽东思想是万能的武器”。不少外国朋友在结束讲话时，都热情地高呼：“毛泽东主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”“毛泽东思想在全世界胜利万岁！”
    十四个国家和地区的反帝战士是不久前退出第十二届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的各国代表，他们在首都万人大会上的讲话受到了极其热烈的欢迎。
    澳大利亚朋友威廉·莫罗在讲话中谴责了日本禁原氢弹协议会领导人的分裂主义行为。他说，一个同分裂主义者和帮助成立象禁止原子弹氢弹国民会议这样的分裂组织相勾结的团体，我们同它不能讲任何团结，因为这个团体的某些成员通过这种或那种方式同帝国主义者勾结在一起。他说，日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会某些领导人正在逐步投靠反动派，我们不能参与他们的任何卑鄙行径。
    莫罗说，我们谨向中国共产党和毛主席表示深厚的谢意，感谢他们伟大的远见，感谢他们对世界革命事业所提供的诚恳的、完善的和正确的指教和领导。我们也感谢中国人民在和平事业中的出色表现。
    巴苏陀兰朋友马佩菲亚内谴责那些控制这次东京大会的人背叛了禁止原子弹氢弹世界运动的光荣传统。他说，世界民主青年联盟是一个修正主义的集团。它不止一次地与美帝国主义勾结，因而成为它的帮凶。在这种情况下，外国代表们不能把这一组织包括在反对美帝国主义的国际统一战线之内，更不能和他们采取任何“联合行动”。
    他说，任何与世界民主青年联盟采取“联合行动”的意见，都只能是协同欺骗世界各国人民，帮助他们掩盖假反帝、真投降，假支持、真出卖统一战线，假团结、真分裂的叛徒嘴脸。
    他在结束讲话时高呼：“打倒美帝国主义及其一切伪装起来的工具！”“打倒一切混乱制造者和分裂主义者！”
    贝专纳朋友塞切尔热烈赞扬中国人民高举毛泽东思想红旗继续进行斗争。他赞扬中国人民坚决支持越南人民和世界各国革命人民的斗争，并且表示贝专纳人民坚决支持越南人民的抗美斗争。
    他说，日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会一些领导人这次背叛了日本人民，参加了鼓吹不惜任何代价要和平的人的臭名远扬的合唱。那些人在所谓“联合行动”的幌子下，实际上是抱着与帝国主义分赃共同主宰世界的阴险目的。他说，既然这次东京大会的领导人已经堕入修正主义的深渊，背叛了日本人民，我们退出这届大会对日本人民只有好处，没有坏处。
    他强调指出，我们拒绝并反对参与出卖世界人民、特别是日本人民的革命的邪恶活动。我们确信，日本人民也决不会听任这种情况发展下去。
    比利时朋友杜皮尔强调指出，我们不能跟那些同各国人民的主要敌人——美帝国主义息息相通的人讲团结。真正的反对美帝国主义的国际统一战线不能包括苏联机会主义者及其合伙者。真正的国际统一战线既要针对美帝国主义，又要针对为美帝国主义效劳的苏联领导集团以及它的盟友和追随者。
    他说，无论是在为赶走北大西洋公约组织的战斗中，还是在声援越南的英勇战士和刚果爱国者而进行的各种活动中，我们都十分重视揭露各国人民的头号敌人美帝国主义的那些伪装起来的代理人。
    他说，在我们的斗争中，伟大的中华人民共和国永远坚定地同我们站在一起。伟大的中华人民共和国是在毛泽东主席天才领导下的光荣的中国共产党所建立的坚不可摧的堡垒。
    他说，全世界人民依靠一条真实的、广泛的反对美帝国主义及其走狗的国际统一战线，必将彻底打败美国侵略者。美帝国主义及其修正主义附庸必败。
    巴西朋友加利亚努强烈谴责美帝国主义把巴西变成了新型殖民地，变成了一个侵略其他拉丁美洲兄弟人民的巨大军事基地。他说，这个严酷而痛苦的现实给我们上了宝贵的一课，我们学会了区分敌友，区分真假革命者。他说，巴西人民永远不会在压力下屈服。我们准备进行长期艰苦的斗争，我们准备进行人民战争，这是唯一夺取胜利的正确道路。
    加利亚努指出，要胜利，就必须有最广泛的国际反帝统一战线。但是，这应当是真正的、真实的、实际的，不能包括美帝国主义的合伙者、走狗和傀儡在内的统一战线。这个统一战线不能包括背叛各国人民的现在的苏联修正主义领导的任何代表人物。这是根本原则问题，如果我们要胜利的话，我们就永远不能离开这个原则。
    他说，我们正在进入彻底战胜以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义、殖民主义和新殖民主义及其一切代理人、合伙者、走狗和傀儡的时代。我们的胜利是必然的，人类崭新的世界将由此而出现。
    他结束讲话时高呼：“毛泽东思想在全世界胜利万岁！”
    锡兰朋友穆图坦特里说，国际反美统一战线绝不能包括美帝国主义的帮凶现代修正主义者，也不能同他们采取任何“联合行动”。我们革命派拒绝利用越南人民和日本人民的名义在显然是假团结的虚假口号下搞骗局，来污辱英雄的越南人民和英勇的日本反帝群众。我们决不去做蓄意出卖勾当的沉默见证者和积极参加者。
    他说，我们不能同我们公认的敌人坐在一起，装出一副和他们友好相处的样子。在涉及革命真理的问题上，在任何时候绝不能作任何的妥协。
    他最后高呼：“中国共产党及其敬爱的领袖毛泽东主席万岁！”
    智利朋友巴洛斯在讲话中强调说，苏联修正主义领导人正在与美国达成各种协议。他们在欧洲同美国取得了谅解，并在最近同日本军国主义相勾结共同反对亚洲人民的革命和越南人民的斗争。他们戴上“援助越南”的假面具，阴谋通过美国的“和平谈判”出卖越南人民的英勇斗争。我们怎么能同这些人团结呢？我们革命者怎么能同这些很久以来就同世界的刽子手搞“联合行动”的人搞“统一行动”呢？接受叛徒们的代表参加我们的队伍，就意味着认可他们的背叛行为，就意味着把我们自己也变成美帝国主义的合伙者，也就意味着欺骗和背叛同美帝国主义进行你死我活斗争的世界各国人民。
    他指出，为了能胜利地对美帝国主义进行斗争和击败美帝国主义，就绝对必须和不可避免地要反对现代修正主义及其公开的和暗藏的代理人。这是一个原则立场。在原则立场方面，我们决不妥协。
    他说，我们应该比以往任何时候更坚强地团结起来，组成一个最广泛的同时又是最纯洁的反对美帝国主义和它的形形色色的走狗的统一战线。
    他最后高呼：“伟大的中国人民和他的最高领袖毛泽东同志万岁！”
    哥伦比亚朋友桑佩尔说，在今天，在我们的时代，在亚非拉各国人民革命的时代，毛泽东思想是一件万能的武器，这件武器不仅正在被中国人民所掌握，而且也被越来越多的世界所有国家和人民的战士所掌握，他们善于运用这个武器来争取自己的胜利。
    他说，十六个国家的三十多位代表牢记着毛主席的帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎、原子弹也是美帝国主义用来吓人的纸老虎的论断，坚守了各国人民在反对核武器、反对原子讹诈、反对对这种武器的反动垄断的斗争中所坚持的正确主张。
    他说，我们在这次东京大会上形成了一个战斗性的统一战线，它排除了苏联修正主义叛徒集团的代理人，排除了美帝国主义的帮凶和合伙者。我们大家团结得象一个人一样，高举伟大的反美、反修、反对反动派的旗帜，为了越南人民战争的胜利和各被压迫的人民和民族的解放而奋斗。
    新西兰朋友戈达德说，全世界人民越来越认清谁是对爱好和平的各国人民进行侵略的罪魁祸首。在越南，正是美国要对历史上最野蛮的一场战争负责，因为它完全破坏了一九五四年日内瓦协议。她说，我们有责任把越南人民多少年来为争取独立所进行的辉煌斗争告诉各国人民，决不允许出卖越南人民。
    她说，我们不能参与越南问题的所谓“谈判”，不管它是从哪里提出来的。我们不能同那种没有决心把反对美帝国主义的斗争进行到底的人讲联合。我们不能同那样的人携手合作，他们在有人用核威力讹诈世界的时候闭眼不看，而当那些被威胁的人采取步骤保卫自己的时候，他们却恐慌地举起双手。
    戈达德强调指出，毛主席和中国共产党领导下的中国人民是全世界争取和平与民族独立斗争的先锋和带路人。她结束讲话时高声欢呼：“毛泽东主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”
    巴拿马朋友梅嫩德斯说，我们正在经历着决战的时刻。以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义已被历史所否定，现在只要对它进行最后的冲击，就能参加它的葬礼了。世界各国人民，一切的革命者和正直的人们，在毛泽东同志光辉的、深刻的思想的指引下，应该共同努力，向地球上的帝国主义统治加以致命的一击。
    他指出，以苏联领导人为首的现代修正主义集团已经成了帝国主义在精神上和政治上的最后支柱。我们和修正主义者不可能同桌而坐，同壶而饮。
    他强调指出，我们主张的团结是以正确地解释战争与和平问题为基础的团结。在这方面，毛泽东的有强大威力的、革命的、反对修正主义的思想支持我们执行正确的反帝路线。我们主张的团结是全世界为了取得持久和平而准备消灭帝国主义的革命者之间的团结。我们义正词严地谴责修正主义者的阴谋，他们要想拖延这一具有历史意义的斗争、拖延各国人民为赢得幸福而进行的这场决战，因此，我们不能跟他们共处一堂。
    梅嫩德斯最后满怀革命激情地说，我们在世界群众的面前取得了胜利，因为指导我们的是我们时代最杰出的马列主义者毛泽东的深刻而又明确的思想。
    西南非洲朋友卡宗加热情地指出，中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导下的中国人民，在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的共同斗争中坚定地和我们并肩站在一起，这使我们各国受压迫的革命人民获得巨大的力量和鼓舞。
    他说，为了最好地为反帝事业服务，同时为了支持日本人民反对帝国主义和修正主义的斗争，我们拒绝同日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会一些领导人所进行的一场政治买卖发生任何关系。
    他指出，争取和平的斗争是反对帝国主义和争取民族解放斗争的组成部分。在这个问题上有两条道路和两条路线摆在世界人民面前，即革命的道路和路线以及反革命的道路和路线。我们与修正主义势力的分界线就在这里。
    他列举大量事例驳斥了苏联修正主义集团胡说帝国主义本性已经改变的无耻谎言。他指出，帝国主义的本性不会改变，美帝国主义是不会放弃它的战争政策的。我们必须把斗争的矛头指向美帝国主义及其合伙者，不断地揭露他们，以各种办法孤立他们。打倒帝国主义的革命斗争是争取持久和平的唯一道路。
    他强调说，一切珍视和平和关心加强争取和平斗争的人们，绝不能同修正主义者搞“联合行动”。我们将永远继续把反对帝国主义的斗争和反对现代修正主义的斗争结合起来。
    苏丹朋友凯尔在讲话中说，我们过去和现在都采取同一立场，即反对以美帝国主义为首的一切战争和侵略势力，同时必须反对以苏联现代修正主义领导集团为中心的新老分裂主义者和修正主义者。在争取和平的斗争中，我们丝毫没有改变我们的基本立场。事实证明，我们的这种原则的立场和态度是正确的。
    凯尔谴责禁止原子弹氢弹协议会的某些领导人和分裂主义者采取的“统一行动”。他说，我们要告诉他们，一个真正广泛的反对美帝国主义的统一战线，在任何情况下都不能包括美帝国主义的帮凶和辩护士即苏联现代修正主义及其追随者。我们的广泛的统一战线是最真实的，而不是虚伪的。
    凯尔驳斥了日本“禁原氢协”的领导人对退出会议的代表的诬蔑。他说，反动派的任何阴谋，现代修正主义者的任何诡计，世界上的任何反动力量，都不能破坏我们同广大日本和平战士之间在争取真正独立与和平的斗争烈火中所锻铸的牢固团结。这种团结在战胜帝国主义和修正主义、争取解放与持久和平的共同斗争中将日益加强。
    斯威士兰朋友恩科西说，我们在东京大会上所进行的斗争是进步的反帝的革命的方针和修正主义方针之间的争执。这个斗争是一个原则问题，是坚持旨在解放人类的正确政策的总路线问题。日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会的一些领导人已经成为现代修正主义者的工具。
    他谴责分裂主义者正在大力破坏被压迫人民的正义斗争尤其是越南兄弟的正义斗争。他说，我们宁可在战斗中牺牲，也不愿做美帝国主义的奴隶和豚鼠之类的试验品而继续生存。他说，越南人民一定胜利，他们将永远把帝国主义及其帮凶赶出越南。
    他说，我们对东京大会进行了简要的分析之后，得出了一个结论，那就是正如我们时代著名的领袖毛泽东主席所说的：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”
    他说，为了我们反对世界帝国主义和修正主义的共同斗争的胜利，一切真正的革命者必须坚强地团结起来，相互支持，密切合作。他说，五洲四海到处都可以听到世界革命者的怒涛，谁要想阻挡这一巨浪，必将灭亡。
    他结束讲话时高呼“毛主席万岁！”
    美国朋友霍金斯在讲话中首先热情地赞扬在毛主席领导下中国革命所取得的非凡成就。他说，我们到目前为止所看到的，使我们确信中国是忠于革命的原则的，这是在毛主席的勇敢和英明的领导下做到的。他说，中国人民所树立的榜样，对正在同帝国主义阴险和恶毒的影响进行斗争的无数其他民族说来是指路标。
    霍金斯代表同美帝国主义进行斗争的美国人民向中国人民致敬。他满怀胜利信心地指出，帝国主义是注定要失败的，物质的财富和核武器都不能挽救它。让我们团结起来，反对反动的帝国主义，不管它在那里。让我们绝对不要和那些会成为帝国主义代理人的人妥协。
    各国反帝战士的讲话，在会场上激起了一阵又一阵长时间的热烈掌声。
