"Many things press for attention; the world turns, time flies. A thousand years is too long, we strive for every moment."

The young Red Guards and revolutionary masses of Fuzhou City have launched a storm of destruction of the old and establishment of the new, sweeping away all the old ideas, culture, customs, and habits of the exploiting classes with an irresistible force.

Red flags wave everywhere, sweeping away the dust.

"Cultural revolution surges ahead,
Red flags wave everywhere, sweeping away the dust.
Smash the stinking 'Harmony' sign,
New spirit in the anti-imperialist hospital,
Shameful scars vanish in an instant,
Doctors, nurses, and patients all rejoice,
Heartfelt love for Chairman Mao,
Firecrackers and songs echo like thunder."

This is a poem written by all the medical staff and patients of the third ward of the internal medicine department of the former Fuzhou Chinese Harmony Hospital, which has just been renamed the Anti-Imperialist Hospital.

The old Harmony Hospital was a product of American imperialism's false charity, used to invade and enslave the Chinese people. The medical staff had twice requested a name change, but both times it was blocked by the vehement opposition of bourgeois "authorities." The roar of the Red Guards from the capital shook the earth and mountains, greatly boosting the morale of revolutionary medical staff. They climbed onto the fifth-floor roof and smashed the eight characters "Fuzhou Chinese Harmony Hospital" installed in 1936, replacing them with the bold red characters "Anti-Imperialist Hospital." The entire hospital immediately buzzed with excitement, and joyous reports were posted at the main entrance.

In their pledge, the revolutionary medical staff declared: Changing the hospital's name is just the beginning. We must also eliminate the influence left behind by American imperialism and truly open our doors to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, turning the hospital into a grand school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Firmly support the Red Guards

The workers have given the most resolute support to the Red Guards' revolutionary rebellion.

In the endless stream of revolutionary masses, there is a particularly eye-catching contingent: a float leads the way in propaganda, followed by workers carrying ladders, buckets of lime, and red paint. This is the urban construction workers of Fuzhou City, with over 400 people mobilized.

They act in coordination with the Red Guards as a swift and decisive revolutionary shock brigade. Wherever a street needs renaming, or a shop needs a new sign, or old decorations need to be removed, they immediately spring into action, destroying the old and establishing the new, with the highest efficiency and speed.

Shanghang Road and Xiahang Road were areas concentrated with capitalists before liberation. Local residents, inspired by the Red Guards and workers, respectively changed these two streets to "Eliminate Capitalism Road" and "Promote Communism Road." When the red paper with the new street names was pasted over the old signs, the old road construction worker and model worker of Fuzhou City, Chen Xingtong, excitedly said, "This is where capitalists sucked the blood and sweat of the working people. Today, we are erasing the traces left by the capitalists, and it is truly satisfying." The revolutionary masses on the scene also cheered in unison.

    同红卫兵一起闹革命
  “多少事，从来急；天地转，光阴迫。一万年太久，只争朝夕。”
    福州市红卫兵小将和广大革命群众掀起的破旧立新的革命风暴，正以不可阻挡之势，扫荡着一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯。
   遍地红旗扫积尘
   “文化革命高潮升，
    遍地红旗扫积尘，
    粉碎‘协和’臭灵牌，
    反帝医院新精神，
    耻辱疤痕一旦消，
    医工病员皆欢腾，
    衷心热爱毛主席，
    爆竹歌声如雷震。”
    这是刚改名为反帝医院的原福州中国协和医院内科三病区全体医务人员和病人写的一首贺诗。
    旧协和医院是美帝国主义假慈善为名，侵略、奴役中国人民的产物。医务人员曾两度要求改名，都由于资产阶级“权威”的极力反对而没有改成。首都红卫兵一声春雷，地动山摇，大长革命医务人员的志气。他们攀上五层屋顶，砸烂一九三六年安上的“福州中国协和医院”八个字，换上大红的“反帝医院”四个大字。全院顿时沸腾，大门口贴满了喜报。
    革命的医务人员在决心书中表示：改了院名，还要肃清美帝国主义遗留下来的影响，真正向工农兵打开大门，把医院办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    坚决支持红卫兵
    红卫兵的革命造反行动，得到了工人最坚决的支持。
    在川流不息的革命队伍中，有一支特别引人注目的队伍：彩车在前头宣传，后面的工人，有的肩扛木梯，有的提着石灰桶、红漆桶。这就是福州市的城市建筑工人队伍，他们一下出动了四百多人。
    他们配合红卫兵一起行动，是一个雷厉风行的革命突击队。哪个街道要改名，哪家商店要换招牌，除掉旧装饰，他们立即行动，破旧立新，效率最高，速度最快。
    上杭路、下杭路是解放前资本家集中的市区。当地群众接受了红卫兵和工人们的倡议，分别把这两条街改为“灭资路”和“兴无路”。当写着新街名的红纸贴上旧路牌的时候，老筑路工人、福州市五好职工标兵班组组长陈行桐兴奋地说：“这里是资本家吸尽我们劳动人民血汗的地方。今天扫除资本家留下来的痕迹，真是大快人心。”在场的革命群众也齐声欢呼。
