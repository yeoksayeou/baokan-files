In 1964, I was transferred from the military to work at the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia. Our embassy, following the teachings of Chairman Mao, faithfully executed the party and state's foreign policies, wholeheartedly developing and strengthening friendly relations between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples. This earned us the praise of the broad masses of the Indonesian people. However, in October 1965, the right-wing reactionary forces in Indonesia, under the plotting of American imperialism, launched a counter-revolutionary military coup. They massacred communists and patriotic progressive forces, brutally persecuted overseas Chinese, and brazenly engaged in anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese sentiment. Faced with this situation, under the leadership of the embassy's party committee, we intensified our study of Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "The rampant activities of all internal and external dark forces have caused national disasters; but this rampancy not only shows that these dark forces still have some strength, but also shows their last struggles, and shows that the people are gradually approaching victory." The Indonesian reactionaries are the same. The Indonesian reactionaries, although appearing ferocious, are actually not so frightening. They attempt to divert people's attention through anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese sentiment, to cover up their reactionary nature, and to deceive the people. This is precisely the weak manifestation of a paper tiger that is strong on the outside but weak on the inside. We must expose their conspiracy and resolutely fight against their anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese atrocities. Chairman Mao's works brought us boundless courage and strength. Comrades all said, what is so great about the Indonesian reactionaries? We are not afraid. At most, it is just death. We will die standing up, unchanging in face and unshaken in heart. As long as we are not afraid of death, our minds will be liberated, and we can spiritually overwhelm the enemy. All comrades in the embassy are determined to learn from Comrade Norman Bethune in this struggle, to learn from his spirit of selflessly dedicating everything to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, and to resolutely pass all tests in this struggle.

The Indonesian reactionaries created a series of anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese incidents. After destroying our consulates in Medan, Makassar, and Surabaya, and attacking other Chinese institutions in Jakarta, on the morning of April 15, more than a thousand armed reactionary soldiers and thugs organized by the right-wing military regime openly attacked our embassy. These fascist thugs shouted anti-Chinese slogans, brandished weapons, and charged into our embassy with murderous intent. They savagely beat our embassy staff, looted embassy property, and insulted our national leaders. They even attempted to desecrate our great national flag, the Five-Star Red Flag. The Five-Star Red Flag is dyed with the blood of countless revolutionary martyrs. It represents our great motherland and our great people. The dignity of our motherland's people is inviolable. All embassy staff were determined to defend it with their blood and lives. Comrades linked arms and stood firmly around the flagpole. More thugs surged in, wielding clubs, iron bars, and stones, striking at the comrades defending the flag. At that time, I and four other comrades were tasked with guarding the building. Seeing their evil deeds, we could not suppress our anger. We immediately requested to join the flag-defending struggle. When a thug raised an iron bar to strike one of our comrades, I immediately rushed forward to shield him with my arms. At that moment, another reactionary soldier hidden among the thugs openly fired at me, and the bullet pierced my right chest. The reactionaries' bloody atrocities further aroused our comrades' hatred for the enemy. Facing the frenzied and ferocious armed thugs, they fearlessly and selflessly fought back bravely and tenaciously, finally foiling the enemy's plot and achieving a great victory in the anti-violence struggle. The bloody crimes committed by these fascist bandits were justly condemned by the people of the world. Their plots failed, and their reactionary faces were further exposed to the people of the world.

This struggle made me further realize that Mao Zedong Thought is an inexhaustible source of revolutionary strength. Armed with Chairman Mao's great thought that all reactionaries are paper tigers, we can spiritually overwhelm all enemies and defeat all enemies.

    敢于斗争就是胜利
    赵小寿
    一九六四年，我从部队转业，分配到驻印尼大使馆工作。我国使馆遵循毛主席的教导，忠实执行党和国家的外交政策，全心全意地发展和加强我国和印尼人民的友好关系，受到印尼广大人民的赞扬。但是，一九六五年十月，印尼的右派反动势力，在美帝国主义的策划下，发动了反革命军事政变。他们大肆屠杀共产党人和爱国进步力量，残酷地迫害华侨，猖狂地反华、排华。面对着这种情形，在使馆党委的领导下，我们加强了毛主席著作的学习。毛主席说：“一切内外黑暗势力的猖獗，造成了民族的灾难；但是这种猖獗，不但表示了这些黑暗势力的还有力量，而且表示了它们的最后挣扎，表示了人民大众逐渐接近了胜利。”印尼的反动派也是如此。印尼反动派表面上是很凶恶的，实际上并没有什么可怕。他们企图通过反华、排华，转移人们视线，掩盖自己的反动面目，欺骗人民，这正是外强中干的纸老虎虚弱的表现。我们必须揭穿他们这一阴谋，同它们的反华、排华暴行进行坚决斗争。毛主席著作给我们带来了无穷的勇气和力量。同志们都说，印尼反动派有什么了不起？我们不怕，大不了就是杀头。死也要站着死，脸不变色，心不跳。只要不怕死，思想就解放了，就能在精神上压倒敌人。我们使馆全体同志都决心在这场斗争中学习白求恩同志，学习他全心全意为中国革命、为世界革命贡献自己一切的无产阶级国际主义精神，坚决在这次斗争中经受住一切考验。
    印尼反动派制造了一系列反华、排华事件。在捣毁了我国驻棉兰、马辰和望加锡等地的领事馆，袭击了我国驻雅加达其他机构后，四月十五日上午，印尼右派军人政权所组织的暴徒和全副武装的反动军人一千多人，公然袭击我国大使馆。这批法西斯暴徒，狂呼反华口号，手持凶器，杀气腾腾，冲进我国大使馆。疯狂地殴打我使馆人员，抢劫使馆财物，辱骂我国家领导人。他们还企图侮辱我们伟大祖国的五星红旗。五星红旗是无数革命先烈的鲜血染红的。她代表着我们伟大的祖国，代表着我们伟大的人民。祖国人民的尊严不容侵犯。全体使馆同志决心用鲜血和生命来保卫她，同志们手臂紧挽着手臂，昂然屹立在旗墩四周。更多的暴徒涌进来了，他们用木棒、铁棍和石头朝着护旗的同志打来。当时，我和另外四个同志担任护卫大楼的任务，看见他们这种罪恶行径，实在抑制不住心中的怒火，我们立即请求参加了卫旗斗争。当一个暴徒举起铁棍正要打我们一个同志的时候，我立即冲上去用两臂护住这个同志，这时，隐藏在一伙暴徒后面的另一名反动军人公然向我开枪射击，子弹穿进了我的右胸。反动派的血腥暴行，更加激起同志们对敌人的仇恨，面对着疯狂、凶恶的大批武装暴徒，他们不畏强暴，不怕牺牲，英勇顽强地坚持斗争，终于粉碎了敌人的阴谋，取得了抗暴斗争的巨大胜利。法西斯匪徒制造的这一血腥罪行，受到全世界人民的正义谴责。他们的阴谋失败了，他们的反动面目进一步暴露在全世界人民面前。
    这次斗争使我进一步体会到，毛泽东思想是革命力量的无限源泉。用毛主席关于一切反动派都是纸老虎的伟大思想武装起来，就能在精神上压倒一切敌人，战胜一切敌人。
