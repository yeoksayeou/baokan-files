The joyous news of the publication of the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has stirred the hearts of the people. We enthusiastically support this great historical document that embodies the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought.

The Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, personally presided over by our great leader Chairman Mao, is a momentous event in the political life of the people of China and the world. The communiqué of the plenary session has greatly boosted the revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary people of China and the world, and has dealt a powerful blow to the counterrevolutionary arrogance of U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and all reactionaries. The communiqué of this plenary session and the decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will further promote a new high tide of studying Chairman Mao's works throughout the Party and the nation, turning the entire country into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. The seven hundred million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and constituting one-fourth of the world's population, under the correct leadership of the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China and the great leader Chairman Mao, will certainly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and build our great socialist motherland into an indestructible iron fortress.

Most respected Chairman Mao: We resolutely respond to the great battle call of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and strive to study, resolutely carry out, actively propagate, and bravely defend Mao Zedong Thought. We will seriously study and resolutely carry out the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and struggle to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, carry the socialist revolution through to the end, and build our country into a powerful socialist state!

Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!
Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!
Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China!
Long live our most, most respected great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!
