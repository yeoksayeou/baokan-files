We are both civilians and soldiers. All members of our militia company engage in production during peacetime, and when needed, we can all pick up our guns to fight the enemy at the sound of a command.

Shanghai Electric Car Factory Maintenance Workshop Militia Company Commander Zhang Guanhai

After studying Chairman Mao's great directive, all members of our militia company were greatly inspired. We wholeheartedly endorse this great directive and are firmly resolved to carry it out.

Chairman Mao's directive is of epoch-making significance; it is a great program to ensure the gradual transition to communism. It is also the fundamental guarantee for us to implement the people's war strategy, strengthen preparedness, and consolidate national defense.

We are both civilians and soldiers. Over the past few years, we have followed Chairman Mao's teachings, actively engaged in production, and diligently studied politics and military affairs, achieving great success. In the early days of liberation, our factory was subjected to savage bombing by U.S.-made planes from the Kuomintang bandits. Some of our workers' families were killed in this bombing. We will never forget this blood debt. With a keen sense of the enemy, we have trained in anti-aircraft defense, repair, shooting, and bayonet combat. Many of us have taken the People's Liberation Army as our example, embodying the spirit of fearlessness and perseverance. On both the production front and the militia front, we have diligently honed our skills. For instance, core militia member and tire worker Chen Changkang is an excellent worker in production and a skilled soldier in military affairs. He is both a model worker and a model militia member. Through studying politics and military affairs, our workshop has achieved a triple harvest in political thought, production, and military affairs. All members of our company engage in production during peacetime, and when needed, we can all pick up our guns to fight the enemy at the sound of a command.

    我们是民也是兵
    我们民兵连全体同志平时搞生产，需要的时候，只要一声令下，个个都能拿起枪杆子打敌人。

    我们民兵连全体同志学习了毛主席的伟大指示以后，受到了莫大的鼓舞。我们最热烈地拥护这一伟大指示，最坚决地执行这一伟大指示。
    毛主席的这一指示，具有划时代的意义，是保证逐步过渡到共产主义的伟大纲领；也是我们贯彻人民战争思想，加强战备，巩固国防的根本保证。
    我们是民，也是兵。几年来，我们遵循毛主席的教导，一面积极搞好生产，一面努力学习政治和军事，取得了很大的成绩。在解放初期，我们车场附近曾遭到蒋匪帮的美制飞机的疯狂轰炸。我们场里有的工人的家属，就是在这次轰炸中被炸死的。我们牢牢记住这一血海深仇，带着敌情观念，训练防空、抢修、射击、刺杀等军事技术。许多人以解放军为榜样，发扬不怕苦、不怕难的精神，在生产岗位和民兵岗位上，同时苦练过硬功夫。象基干民兵、轮胎工陈长康，在生产上是一把好手，在军事上也是一把好手，既是五好工人、又是五好民兵。通过学政治，学军事，我们车间出现了政治思想、生产、军事三丰收的局面。全连同志平时搞生产，需要的时候，只要一声令下，个个都能拿起枪杆子打敌人。
