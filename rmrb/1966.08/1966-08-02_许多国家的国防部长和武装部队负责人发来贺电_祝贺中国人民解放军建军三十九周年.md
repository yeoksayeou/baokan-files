The Chinese People's Liberation Army further develops its glorious traditions and resolutely implements the Marxist-Leninist line of the Party on military construction and development. It has a high level of proletarian consciousness, a lofty proletarian spirit, and an indomitable fighting will, and has made comprehensive preparations in terms of ideology, politics, and military affairs to reliably defend the People's Republic of China, the socialist cause, and the peace of Asia and the world. The Chinese People's Liberation Army, as the faithful son of the people, has made and is making brilliant contributions in carrying out the tasks proposed by the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, which are to deepen the revolution in the cultural field, oppose bourgeois and revisionist thoughts, oppose anti-Party and anti-socialist elements, and carry the great revolutionary and socialist cause to the end. All of this makes us feel very happy and greatly inspired. The message said that our two countries' peoples and armies have an eternal fighting friendship. Under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Marxist-Leninist parties of our two countries, our peoples and armies, who have close brotherly unity and cooperation, will in the future resolutely struggle for the victory of the socialist revolution, for the purity of Marxism-Leninism, and against the imperialist aggressors led by the United States and the modern revisionists centered on the Soviet Union. The visit of the Albanian Party and government delegation led by Comrade Shehu to the People's Republic of China, the visit of the Chinese Party and government delegation led by Comrade Zhou Enlai to Albania, and the recent visit of the Chinese military delegation to our country have further strengthened the great friendship and fighting unity between the peoples and armies of Albania and China.

	Long live and further strengthen the great, unbreakable friendship and fighting unity between the peoples and armies of Albania and China.

	In his congratulatory message, Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, General Vo Nguyen Giap, warmly praised the Chinese People's Liberation Army for its high revolutionary spirit and strong fighting will under the correct leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party led by Chairman Mao Zedong, making decisive contributions to the great success of the Chinese revolution. The message said that in the past war against French colonialists and in the current socialist construction and anti-American national salvation struggle, the Vietnamese people and the Vietnamese People's Army have always received immense sympathy, support, and aid full of proletarian internationalism from the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. We, the Vietnamese people and the Vietnamese People's Army, sincerely and deeply appreciate this resolute, thorough, and sincere aid and regard it as a powerful encouragement for our just struggle against American aggression. The message said that we are determined to turn Chairman Ho Chi Minh's sacred call on July 17th for anti-American national salvation into decisive actions on all fronts, ready to endure any hardships and sacrifices, and fight resolutely until final victory.

	In his congratulatory message, Minister of People's Armed Forces of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, General Kim Chang-bong, warmly congratulated the Chinese People's Liberation Army for its great achievements in defending its homeland and revolutionary gains under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party led by Comrade Mao Zedong. The message said that we are genuinely pleased with all these achievements.

	I am convinced that the friendship, unity, and cooperation between the peoples and armies of the two countries will further develop in the common struggle against American imperialism and for the security of our two countries and the peace of Asia and the world.

	The congratulatory message from Deputy Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and Chairman of the Military Commission, Nguyen Van Thieu, said that the glorious fighting history of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which has won a hundred battles, has convincingly proven the correctness of Chairman Mao Zedong's military line and provided invaluable and rich experience for the armed revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries. At the same time, it has highly established the glorious example of revolutionary heroism, fighting tirelessly and unyieldingly against the enemies of the nation and progressive humanity until the final victory.

	The message said that the people of South Vietnam and their armed forces are determined to stand shoulder to shoulder with the fraternal Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the struggle against the common enemy, American imperialism and its lackeys. No matter how much the American imperialists intensify and expand the war, no matter how great the hardships and sacrifices they endure, the military and people of the South will learn from the tenacious fighting example of all the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, fight resolutely, never retreat, until the final victory, and resolutely complete the glorious cause of liberating South Vietnam and reunifying the country, making active contributions to the defense of peace in Asia and the world.

	The congratulatory message from Commander-in-Chief of the People's Liberation Army of Laos, Kaysone Phomvihane, said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army has become an invincible powerful army because it is armed with Mao Zedong Thought. It is not only a strong pillar of socialist construction and the great People's Republic of China but also an important factor in defending the peace of Asia and the world.

	The message said that Laos and China share a 400-kilometer common border and have a common enemy, American imperialism. We, the Lao People's Liberation Army, are determined to strengthen unity with the Chinese People's Liberation Army, fight more resolutely, strike at American imperialism and its lackeys, and achieve national victory.
