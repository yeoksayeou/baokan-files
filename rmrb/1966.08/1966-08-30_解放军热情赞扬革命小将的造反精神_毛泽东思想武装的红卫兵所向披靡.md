The People's Liberation Army enthusiastically praises the rebellious spirit of the revolutionary youngsters. The Red Guards armed with Mao Zedong Thought are invincible.

The broad ranks of officers and soldiers have expressed their determination to stand together with the Red Guards, under the command of the great leader Chairman Mao, using the "Sixteen Points" as a weapon, to sweep away all the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes.

Xinhua News Agency, August 29th: The broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, with boundless revolutionary fervor and admiration, enthusiastically acclaim the fighting spirit of the Red Guards, which is invincible and has achieved great feats. They express their determination to learn from the Red Guards' thorough revolutionary spirit and revolutionary actions, and to pay heartfelt tribute to the heroic Red Guards. The officers and soldiers say, workers, peasants, and soldiers are the main force of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Red Guards have taken the lead in this mass movement of cultural revolution, charging into the fray. We resolutely stand together with the Red Guards in the struggle, under the command of the great leader Chairman Mao, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, using the "Sixteen Points" as a weapon, and vowing to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

In recent days, many units have held symposiums, written articles, and sent letters, unanimously praising the revolutionary spirit and actions of the young Red Guards in sweeping away the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. They are determined to learn from the young Red Guards. The officers and soldiers of a reconnaissance company in a unit of the Nanjing Military Region wrote to the Red Guards, saying, "Under the brilliant leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, you have swung the iron fist of revolution, smashing the remnants of the old society and the old customs to pieces, making all the ghosts and monsters lose their arrogance. It is truly heartening! A thousand cheers! Ten thousand cheers! We applaud your spirit of daring to rebel against the old world, your proletarian backbone. We are proud to have such an invincible Red Guard force. You are truly Chairman Mao's good students, truly good fighters armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We learn from you, we salute you, and we firmly support your revolutionary actions, standing behind you. A close comrade of Dong Cunrui, Yi Shunyi, said, "As an old soldier, seeing a new generation of revolutionaries grow up in the storm of class struggle, I feel immensely excited and proud. I firmly support the young Red Guards in their thorough revolutionary actions and humbly learn from them." Yi Shunyi expressed his determination to carry forward the brave spirit of Dong Cunrui in blowing up the fortress, and to smash the old world to pieces together with the young Red Guards, carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Many officers and soldiers of the Chengdu Military Region enthusiastically acclaimed the Red Guards as the vanguard, the pioneers, and the shock troops of the revolution. They are the bravest, the smartest, and the most daring, saying what they mean, doing what they say; doing it well, doing it fast, doing it thoroughly. All the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits that poison the people of the exploiting classes are trampled under their feet. They thoroughly crush the arrogance of the bourgeoisie and boost the morale of the proletariat and the revolutionary people.

The officers and soldiers also expressed their determination to stand together with the young Red Guards, to learn, grasp, and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle, using Mao Zedong Thought as the guideline and the "Sixteen Points" as a weapon, to thoroughly criticize the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, and to establish the new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits of the proletariat and socialism. They will deeply root Mao Zedong Thought, firmly stand on the proletarian position, and closely connect with the masses. The officers and soldiers of the "Red Spear Company" on the front line in Fujian said, "The Red Guards have achieved brilliant feats in a short time on the battlefield. This is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought, the result of the Red Guards listening to Chairman Mao's words, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and arming themselves with Mao Zedong Thought. Those armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the smartest, the bravest, and the strongest. In recent years, our company has been actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, continuously promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking, and has been rated as a model company for five consecutive years. Last year, we were honored with the title of 'Red Spear Company' by the Ministry of National Defense. The experience of the Red Guards and our experience both prove: Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeblood, the fundamental guarantee of victory." Song Lushan, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works in the Wuhan Military Region, said, "The young Red Guards are good fighters who listen to Chairman Mao's words and carry out the revolution according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We must study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, work hard on the application, arm ourselves with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and thoroughly smash the old world and create a new world." The officers and soldiers of a unit in the Beijing Military Region expressed their determination to study and apply Chairman Mao's works together with the young Red Guards in this acute and complex class struggle of the cultural revolution, to learn, understand, master, and apply the "Sixteen Points," using the "Sixteen Points" as a weapon, to resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and not to lay down arms until complete victory is achieved!

    解放军热情赞扬革命小将的造反精神
    毛泽东思想武装的红卫兵所向披靡
    广大指战员表示坚决同红卫兵一起，在伟大统帅毛主席指挥下，以十六条为武器，横扫一切剥削阶级的旧思想旧文化旧风俗旧习惯。
    新华社二十九日讯  人民解放军广大指战员怀着无限崇敬的革命激情，热烈欢呼红卫兵的斗争锋芒，所向披靡，欢呼红卫兵的功勋，表示一定要好好学习红卫兵的彻底革命精神和革命行动，衷心地向英雄的红卫兵致敬。指战员们说，工农兵是无产阶级文化大革命的主力军，红卫兵充当了文化大革命这个群众运动冲锋陷阵的急先锋，我们坚决同红卫兵团结战斗在一起，在伟大统帅毛主席的指挥下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以十六条为武器，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    连日来，许多部队指战员纷纷开座谈会，写文章，写信，同声赞扬红卫兵小将们横扫资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯的革命造反精神和革命行动，决心向红卫兵小将们学习。南京部队某部侦察连指战员写给红卫兵的信中说，你们在伟大统帅毛主席的英明指挥下，抡起革命的铁拳，把旧社会的残迹和旧习惯势力砸得落花流水，把一切牛鬼蛇神砸得威风扫地。真是大快人心！一千个好！一万个好！我们为你们这种敢于造旧世界的反的无产阶级硬骨头精神欢呼，我们为有你们这样一支所向披靡的红卫兵队伍而骄傲。你们不愧为毛主席的好学生，不愧为用毛泽东思想武装起来的好战士。我们向你们学习，向你们致敬，坚决支持你们的革命行动，作你们的后盾。董存瑞生前亲密战友郅顺义说，作为一个老兵，眼看着一代革命新人在阶级斗争风浪中成长，我感到无比的兴奋和自豪。我坚决支持红卫兵小将们这种彻底的革命行动，最虚心地向小将们学习。郅顺义表示要发扬董存瑞炸碉堡的勇敢精神，和小将们一起把旧世界砸得粉碎，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。成都部队许多指战员满怀激情地欢呼红卫兵是革命的尖兵，革命的闯将，革命的急先锋，他们最勇敢、最聪明、最有魄力，说干就干，说到做到；干得好，干得快，干得彻底，一切剥削阶级毒害人民的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，统统被他们踩在脚下。大灭资产阶级的威风，大长无产阶级和革命人民的志气。
    指战员们还表示，坚决同红卫兵小将们一起，在斗争中进一步学会毛泽东思想，掌握毛泽东思想，运用毛泽东思想，以毛泽东思想为指针，以十六条为武器，大破资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，大立无产阶级、社会主义的新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯，把毛泽东思想的根子扎得深深的，把无产阶级立场站得稳稳的，把联系群众搞得紧紧的。福建前线某部“红色尖刀连”指战员说，红卫兵们上阵不久，就创建了光辉的功勋，这是毛泽东思想的胜利，是红卫兵们听毛主席的话，活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装头脑的结果。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人最聪明，最勇敢，最坚强。近几年来，我们连队活学活用毛主席著作，不断促进人的思想革命化，连续五年评上四好连队，去年荣获国防部授予“红色尖刀连”的光荣称号。红卫兵的经验和我们的经验都证明：毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，是取得胜利的根本保证。武汉部队学习毛主席著作积极分子宋乐山说，红卫兵小将们是听毛主席的话，按毛主席指示闹革命的好战士。我们只有在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，在用字上狠下功夫，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装头脑，才能彻底砸碎旧世界，创造新世界。北京部队某部指战员表示，在文化大革命这场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，要和红卫兵小将们一起进一步活学活用毛主席著作，学习十六条，熟悉十六条，掌握十六条，运用十六条，以十六条为武器，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，不获全胜，决不收兵！
