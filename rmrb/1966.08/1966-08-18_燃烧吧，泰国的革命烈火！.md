"From a single spark, a prairie fire may burst into flame." The development of the armed struggle of the Thai people has once again proven this great truth.

The armed struggle of the Thai people began with small forces, but after just over a year, the revolutionary spark they ignited has spread like wildfire. The more the U.S. imperialists and the Thai reactionaries try to extinguish it, the more fiercely it burns. This is the law of development for all people's revolutionary struggles.

The Thai people have taken up arms to fight, and in the battle, they have grown rapidly and become stronger, defeating the U.S. imperialists and the Thai reactionaries, causing them to suffer heavy losses and suffer defeats. This shows that revolutionary armed forces fighting for people's liberation and united with the people are invincible.

The continuous victories of the Thai armed forces prove that the U.S. imperialists and the Thai reactionaries are paper tigers. Chairman Mao said, "I say all reactionaries are paper tigers. Why? Because they are divorced from the people." The U.S. imperialists and their running dogs, the Thanom group, will inevitably be overthrown by the Thai people.

Victory will surely belong to the Thai people who dare to struggle and are good at struggling. Let the revolutionary fire of armed struggle burn more fiercely on the land of Thailand!

　　燃烧吧，泰国的革命烈火！
    “星星之火，可以燎原。”泰国人民武装斗争的发展，再一次证明了这一伟大真理。
    泰国人民武装开始时，虽然力量很小，但是，只经过一年多的时间，他们燃起的革命的星星之火，就以燎原之势扩大起来。美帝国主义和泰国反动派越是想要扑灭它，它就燃烧得越是炽烈。这是一切人民革命斗争发展的规律。
    泰国人民拿起武器起来斗争，在战斗中迅速成长壮大，把美帝国主义和泰国反动派打得损兵折将、连吃败仗。这说明为人民解放而战斗的、同人民打成一片的革命武装力量，是无敌的。
    泰国人民武装不断取得的辉煌胜利，证明了美帝国主义和泰国反动派都是纸老虎。毛主席说，“我说一切所有号称强大的反动派统统不过是纸老虎。原因是他们脱离人民。”与人民为敌的美帝国主义和它的走狗他侬集团，必然要被泰国人民所打倒。
    胜利一定属于敢于斗争善于斗争的泰国人民。让武装斗争的革命烈火，在泰国土地上更炽烈地燃烧起来吧！
