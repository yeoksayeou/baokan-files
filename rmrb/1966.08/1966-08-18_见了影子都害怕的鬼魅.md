Title: Those Who Fear Their Own Shadows

The publishing statement for the *Ruxin Manuscripts* published by the Cultural Relics Press in 1964 was meticulously crafted under the collusion of Zhou Yang and his followers. After the initial draft of the publishing statement was written, it was heavily edited by Zhou Yang and his accomplices, altered beyond recognition, and hacked to pieces. The original draft mentioned Chairman Mao's high praise for Lu Xun, which was erased; the original draft mentioned that Lu Xun's manuscripts are precious revolutionary documents and a rich cultural heritage, which was cut out; the original draft discussed plans to reproduce Lu Xun's literary creations and letter manuscripts, which was changed to only reproduce the manuscripts of *Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk* and *New Tales*.

Zhou Yang and his followers' extensive deletions in the publishing statement were a blatant opposition to Chairman Mao's summary of the literary struggles of the 1930s and his high praise for Lu Xun.

Zhou Yang and his gang's refusal to reproduce the complete *Ruxin Manuscripts* also harbored ulterior motives.

The complete *Ruxin Manuscripts* were originally planned to be published in twenty volumes, from 1963 to the thirtieth anniversary of Lu Xun's death in 1966. However, just as the manuscripts of *Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk* and *New Tales* were being printed, Zhou Yang and his followers suddenly decided to halt the publication of the complete *Ruxin Manuscripts*, changing the manuscripts of *Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk* and *New Tales* to be published as separate volumes. Where is the ghost? It turns out that Zhou Yang and his gang were guilty, knowing that following the manuscripts of *Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk* and *New Tales*, the manuscripts of Lu Xun's *Random Thoughts from the Thatched Cottage* and other letter manuscripts would be published. In these essays and letters, Lu Xun raised the banner of cultural revolution, not only engaging in a fearless struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries but also conducting merciless criticism of the ghosts on the literary scene at that time, some of which were directed at Zhou Yang and his gang. If these manuscripts were published, wouldn't the ugly faces of Zhou Yang and his gang be exposed?

What is particularly infuriating is that Zhou Yang and his gang subjected the preface written by Comrade Xu Guangping for the complete *Ruxin Manuscripts* to countless obstacles, followed by arbitrary deletions, and finally, they arbitrarily removed it. The preface stated: “Unless intentionally distorted, those who fear their own shadows, ghosts that cannot bear the sunlight, except for these things, everyone can understand the significance of preserving Lu Xun's manuscripts.” Zhou Yang and his gang are precisely these ghosts that cannot bear the sunlight; they are extremely afraid of the publication of Lu Xun's manuscripts and thus resort to every means to suppress and kill them.

### “见了影子都害怕的鬼魅”

　　“见了影子都害怕的鬼魅”
    文物出版社在一九六四年出版的《鲁迅手稿》的出版说明，是在周扬及其追随者的合谋下，精心制作成的。这个出版说明的初稿写成以后，在周扬及其同伙的刀砍斧削之下，改得面目全非，砍得不像样子。原稿中提到毛主席对鲁迅的崇高评价，给抹掉了；原稿中提到鲁迅的手稿是珍贵的革命文献、丰富的文化遗产，被砍掉了；原稿中谈到准备影印鲁迅的文学创作和书信的手稿，被改成只影印《朝花夕拾》和《故事新编》的手稿了。周扬及其追随者在出版说明中大砍大删，这是明目张胆地反对毛主席对三十年代的文艺斗争的历史总结和对鲁迅的崇高评价。
    周扬一伙不准影印《鲁迅手稿》全集，也包藏着不可告人的目的。
      《鲁迅手稿》全集，原定计划出版二十册，从一九六三年起到一九六六年鲁迅逝世三十周年时出齐。可是，正当《朝花夕拾》《故事新编》两部手稿在印制的时候，周扬及其追随者突然决定，停止《鲁迅手稿》全集的出版工作，《朝花夕拾》《故事新编》两部手稿改作单行本印行。鬼在哪里？原来周扬一伙作贼心虚，他们知道，紧随《朝花夕拾》《故事新编》两部手稿之后，就要出版鲁迅的《且介亭杂文集》手稿以及其他书信手稿。在这些杂文和书信的手稿中，鲁迅高举起文化革命的大旗，不仅对帝国主义、封建主义、国民党反动派进行了英勇不屈的斗争，并且对当时文坛上的鬼魅也进行了无情的抨击，其中有些就是针对周扬一伙开火的。如果这些手稿发表，岂不是把周扬一伙的丑恶面目暴露无遗？！
    尤其令人气愤的是，周扬一伙对许广平同志为《鲁迅手稿》全集写的序言，先是百般刁难，继而横加删改，最后竟擅自抽掉。因为序言指出：“只要不是有意歪曲，见了影子都害怕的见不得阳光的鬼魅，除了这一些东西之外，大家都能体会到保存鲁迅手稿的意义的。”周扬等人，正是这些见不得阳光的鬼魅，他们非常害怕鲁迅手稿的出版，因而千方百计地加以压制和扼杀。
