	We are filled with immense excitement as we heard the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee. The communiqué spoke the words in our revolutionary hearts, making our vision clearer and our hearts brighter. We resolutely respond to the Party's call and resolutely carry out the combat tasks proposed in the communiqué.

	Dear Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao:

	Currently, both domestically and internationally, the situation is excellent. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. A few years ago, a dark cloud temporarily appeared internationally. The Soviet revisionist leadership clique, in collusion with imperialism and reactionaries, stirred up waves and launched an anti-China chorus. At that time, our country suffered three consecutive years of natural disasters, and the class enemies took the opportunity to launch counterattacks. At this critical moment, it was you who dispelled the clouds for us, pointing out the bright future of the revolution; it was you who steadfastly steered the ship, leading us to repel the class enemies' repeated arrogant attacks, leading us to bravely advance in stormy seas. Countless facts make us infinitely love, believe in, and worship Mao Zedong Thought. We firmly believe that with Chairman Mao, China has a future, and the world has a future.

	Currently, our country is carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We declare: in this movement, we will resolutely follow the great leader Chairman Mao and advance bravely, overthrowing, overthrowing, and exposing those in power who are taking the capitalist road, sweeping away all ghosts and monsters and bourgeois decadent thoughts, and thoroughly transforming ourselves to become successors of communism.

	Long live the Communist Party of China!

	Long live Chairman Mao!

	Long live the invincible great Mao Zedong Thought!

	All revolutionary comrades of the Qinghai Petroleum Management Bureau Exploration Department Technical Team

　　永远跟着您在大风大浪里前进最敬爱的党中央最敬爱的毛主席：
    我们以万分激动的心情，听到了八届十一中全会的公报。“公报”说出了我们革命人民的心里话，使我们的眼更明，心更亮。我们坚决响应党的号召，坚决执行“公报”提出的战斗任务。
    敬爱的党中央、毛主席：当前国内外是一片大好形势，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。几年前，国际上暂时出现了一片乌云，苏共修正主义领导集团伙同帝国主义和反动派兴风作浪，掀起了反华大合唱。当时，我们国内遭受了连续三年的自然灾害，阶级敌人乘机大搞反攻倒算。在这紧要关头，是您，给我们拨开了乌云，指出了革命的光明前途；是您，稳掌航舵，领导我们打退了阶级敌人一次次的猖狂进攻，领导我们在大风大浪里勇敢前进。无数的事实，使我们对毛泽东思想无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜。我们坚信，有了毛主席，中国就有了前途，世界就有了前途。
    当前，我国正在进行无产阶级文化大革命。我们表示：在运动中要坚决跟着伟大领袖毛主席奋勇前进，斗倒、斗垮、斗臭走资本主义道路的当权派，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神和资产阶级腐朽思想，同时彻底改造自己，做共产主义接班人。
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    战无不胜的伟大毛泽东思想万岁！
