The Lu Xun Arts Academy in Yan'an (abbreviated as Lu Xun Arts Academy) was established in the spring of 1938 under the personal care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Its primary mission was to cultivate revolutionary artists who would serve the Anti-Japanese War and the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. The first, second, and the first half of the third terms of the Lu Xun Arts Academy were indeed doing this. After studying for about three months, they were assigned to various anti-Japanese base areas to work.

In the spring of 1940, Zhou Yang arrived at the Lu Xun Arts Academy and usurped the position of deputy director. Upon his arrival, he began to transform the Lu Xun Arts Academy according to his bourgeois worldview. He arbitrarily altered the guidelines set by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, denying the fine traditions of the Lu Xun Arts Academy in linking theory with practice, serving the war of resistance, and serving the masses. He changed the direction of the Lu Xun Arts Academy, hoisting the black flag of bourgeois education to oppose Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao taught us in "On New Democracy" that the new democratic culture "should serve the ninety percent or more of the working people in the entire nation and gradually become their culture." Chairman Mao also warned us that when absorbing foreign things, we must exclude the dross and absorb the essence, "and we must not swallow them whole and uncritically."

But what did Zhou Yang do? Under the slogans of "research first" and "study first," he led the Lu Xun Arts Academy down the path of closing the door to raise standards. He vigorously promoted the big, foreign, and ancient, advocating the learning of foreign classical masterpieces and the "great masters" of the 18th and 19th centuries. He treasured the theories of Belinsky and Chernyshevsky; he regarded the works of Shakespeare, Tolstoy, Balzac, and Turgenev as models. In creation, he promoted critical realism and advocated writing about familiar life and genuine emotions. In reality, these were all bourgeois and petty-bourgeois things.

Under Zhou Yang's control, the artistic education of the Lu Xun Arts Academy completely inherited Western bourgeois culture. For example, in music education, in the entire curriculum, classroom teaching and book knowledge were emphasized, and technical courses dominated everything; at the same time, bourgeois artists were worshipped as idols, and songs like "In the Dark Grave" and "The Nutcracker" were appreciated. During rehearsals and performances, the male and female chorus members wore black Ukrainian-style shirts and black long dresses in the style of the Virgin Mary, singing religious hymns and bourgeois songs from the 1930s such as "Flowers Are Not Flowers" and "Three Wishes of Roses," etc. Where was the atmosphere of resistance? Where was the revolutionary atmosphere of Yan'an?

The location of the Lu Xun Arts Academy, Qiaozigou, is a rural area, but Zhou Yang forgot all about the workers and peasants. Under his control, the teachers and students of the Lu Xun Arts Academy did not go to the countryside for nearly two years, except for once in 1941. This time, they took things like "Kafka" and "The Hunters' Chorus," and "Fishermen on the Beach," all of which were programs detached from the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The masses were very dissatisfied, but when they returned and summarized, they instead slandered the masses as having "low standards."

The black wind that Zhou Yang blew in the Lu Xun Arts Academy had a very bad influence on the Lu Xun Arts Academy and other art troupes and schools. Some people spent all day thinking about how to write big works, write symphonies, and did not create works to serve the resistance and the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

At that time, it was the most difficult period of the Anti-Japanese War. At this moment, how much we needed revolutionary literary works to enhance the fighting spirit and confidence in victory of the broad masses of soldiers and civilians! But Zhou Yang isolated the Lu Xun Arts Academy from the great Anti-Japanese War and from the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

In 1942, the great Yan'an Rectification Movement began. Chairman Mao delivered the epoch-making speech "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," which finally stopped Zhou Yang's black wind.

On May 30, 1942, Chairman Mao personally came to Qiaozigou and gave very important instructions to the entire faculty and students of the Lu Xun Arts Academy. Chairman Mao encouraged the faculty and students of the Lu Xun Arts Academy to go out of the small Lu Xun Arts Academy and into the big Lu Xun Arts Academy (the life of the workers, peasants, and soldiers). Chairman Mao's teachings greatly inspired and encouraged the entire faculty and students. The direction of the Lu Xun Arts Academy was corrected, and the path forward was found. However, Zhou Yang harbored resentment towards Chairman Mao's criticism and adopted an attitude of paying lip service while acting against the instructions, insisting on his reactionary bourgeois stance.

Chairman Mao instructed: The rectification movement first needs to be rectified in thought and needs to launch a struggle between the proletariat and the non-proletariat in thought.

Regarding Chairman Mao's wise instructions, Zhou Yang strongly resisted. He did not organize the faculty and students of the Lu Xun Arts Academy to deeply and meticulously study the "Talks" and Chairman Mao's instructions at the Lu Xun Arts Academy, nor did he promote democracy and allow the entire faculty and students to criticize. To avoid exposing his fox's tail, he only spent a few days discussing it hastily, playing a trick of fake rectification and real resistance to the Central Committee. In the end, he made a false self-criticism, turning his serious crime of altering Chairman Mao's direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers into just a problem of epistemology and methodology.

Since the 1930s, Zhou Yang has been conducting anti-Party activities under the banner of "National Defense Literature." In the 1940s, he used Yan'an Lu Xun Arts Academy as a base to attempt to cultivate a black army of bourgeois literature, waiting for the liberation of the entire country to occupy the literary and artistic front, and seize the opportunity to pave the way for the restoration of capitalism. We must not let Zhou Yang slip away again; we must thoroughly settle his accounts!

　　延安“鲁艺”时期的反党老手
    延安鲁迅文学艺术学院（简称鲁艺）是在党中央、毛主席的亲切关怀下，于一九三八年春天创办的。它的主要任务是培养为抗日战争服务的、为工农兵大众服务的革命的艺术工作者。鲁艺的第一期、第二期和第三期的前半段都是这样做的。学习三个月左右，便分配到各个抗日根据地去工作。
    一九四○年春天，周扬到了鲁艺，窃踞了副院长的职务。他一到鲁艺，就按照他的资产阶级世界观改造鲁艺。他擅自篡改党中央、毛主席所制订的方针，否定鲁艺的理论联系实际，为抗战服务、为群众服务的优良传统，改变鲁艺的方向，竖起了资产阶级教育的黑旗，来和毛泽东思想相对抗。
    毛主席在《新民主主义论》中教导我们，新民主主义的文化“应为全民族中百分之九十以上的工农劳苦民众服务，并逐渐成为他们的文化”。毛主席还告诫我们，吸收一切外国的东西要排除糟粕，吸取其精华，“决不能生吞活剥地毫无批判地吸收。”
    而周扬是怎么做的呢？他在“研究第一”“学习第一”的口号下，把鲁艺引向了关门提高的歧途。他大力提倡大、洋、古，号召向外国古典名著和十八、十九世纪的资产阶级“大师”学习，把别林斯基、车尔尼雪夫斯基等人的理论奉为至宝；把莎士比亚、托尔斯泰以及巴尔扎克、屠格涅夫等人的作品看成典范。在创作上提倡批判现实主义，提倡写自己熟悉的生活，真实的情感。实际上这些都是资产阶级、小资产阶级的东西。
    在周扬的把持下，鲁艺的艺术教育生搬硬套地全面继承西洋资产阶级文化。比如音乐教育，在全部课程里，强调课堂教学，书本知识，技术课压倒一切；同时，把资产阶级艺术家当成偶像，欣赏什么《在阴暗的坟墓里》、《胡桃夹子》等等。在排练和演出时，男女合唱队员分别穿着黑色的乌克兰式的衬衫和圣母式的黑色长裙，高唱宗教赞美诗和三十年代资产阶级歌曲《花非花》《玫瑰三愿》等等。这哪里还有什么抗战的气氛呢？这哪儿还像在革命圣地延安呢？
    鲁艺所在地桥儿沟是农村，然而周扬把工农忘得干干净净。在他的把持下，鲁艺师生在那两年中几乎没有下过乡，只有一九四一年下去过一次。这次带去的是什么《卡豪夫卡》呵，什么《猎人合唱》呵，什么《海滨渔夫》等等，都是一些脱离工农兵的节目。群众非常不满意，可是回来总结时，却反而污蔑群众听不懂是“水平低”。
    周扬在鲁艺吹起的这股黑风，在鲁艺及其他文艺团体和学校，产生了极恶劣的影响。有些人整天想的是如何写大作品，写交响乐，就是不搞为抗战服务、为工农兵服务的作品。
    当时，正是抗日战争最艰苦的阶段。在这样的时刻，多么需要用革命的文艺作品去提高广大军民的斗争热情和胜利信心呵！而周扬却把鲁艺与伟大的抗日战争隔绝，与广大工农兵群众隔绝。
    一九四二年，伟大的延安整风运动开始了。毛主席发表了具有划时代意义的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，这才煞住了周扬的这股黑风。
    一九四二年五月三十日，毛主席亲自来到桥儿沟，向鲁艺全体师生做了非常重要的指示。毛主席鼓励鲁艺的师生走出小鲁艺，到大鲁艺（工农兵群众生活）里去。毛主席的教导，给了全院师生莫大的启发和鼓舞。鲁艺的方向端正了，前进的道路找到了。然而，周扬对毛主席的批评却怀恨在心，对毛主席的指示采取阳奉阴违的态度，坚持他的反动资产阶级立场。
    毛主席指示说：整风运动首先需要在思想上整顿，需要展开一个无产阶级对非无产阶级的思想斗争。
    对于毛主席的英明指示，周扬竭力抵制。他不组织鲁艺师生深入地、细致地学习《讲话》和毛主席在鲁艺所作的指示，也不发扬民主，放手让全院师生进行批评。为了不使自己的狐狸尾巴被抓住，他只用几天时间，草率地讨论了一下，对中央耍了一套假整风、真抗拒的手法。最后，他作了一个假检讨，把他篡改毛主席的工农兵方向的严重罪行，说成仅仅是认识论、方法论的问题。
    周扬从三十年代起便打着“国防文学”的旗子进行反党活动，到了四十年代，他又以延安鲁艺为据点，妄图培养一支资产阶级文艺黑军，以待全国解放后占领文学艺术阵地，伺机为复辟资本主义开道。我们决不能再让周扬滑过去，我们一定要彻底清算他的罪恶！
