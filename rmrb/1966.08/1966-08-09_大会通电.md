	Telegram from the Meeting

	New China News Agency, August 8th

	The full text of the telegram from the meeting of the capital's people from all walks of life opposing U.S. imperialism and supporting the struggle of American blacks against racial discrimination is as follows:

	The people of Beijing from all walks of life held a rally of ten thousand people today to solemnly commemorate the third anniversary of the issuance of the statement by Chairman Mao Zedong, the beloved leader of the Chinese people, "In Support of the American Blacks in Their Just Struggle Against Racial Discrimination by U.S. Imperialism."

	The meeting expresses the highest respect and firm support to the brave American black brothers who are fighting against racial discrimination! The meeting extends heartfelt sympathies to the American black brothers who have suffered persecution in the struggle! The meeting expresses intense anger and strong protest against the U.S. imperialism that brutally persecutes and suppresses American blacks!

	Three years ago, Chairman Mao's statement shone with the brilliant light of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao's statement has profound political influence and great historical significance. It is a great call to arms against U.S. imperialism's racial discrimination. It greatly inspired the fighting spirit of American blacks! The meeting reaffirms that the 700 million Chinese people most resolutely and enthusiastically support Chairman Mao's statement.

	Over the past three years, the development of the struggle of American blacks has proven that Chairman Mao's statement is extremely wise, completely correct, and an unshakable truth.

	Over the past three years, the struggle of American blacks against racial discrimination has spread like wildfire across the entire United States. Since this summer, a series of armed resistance struggles by blacks have erupted in major cities such as Chicago. The struggle of American blacks has begun to take the path of revolutionary violence against counter-revolutionary violence. This marks a new stage in the struggle of American blacks.

	Through years of struggle, the class consciousness of American blacks has been continuously raised. They increasingly direct their struggle against a small clique of American reactionary rulers. The struggle of American blacks is increasingly combined with the movement of the American people against the U.S. imperialist war in Vietnam. This is a great support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and it is also a great support for the anti-U.S. struggle of all the people of the world.

	Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. U.S. imperialism has already been surrounded by the people of the world. It is sitting on a volcano that could erupt at any moment. The U.S. reactionary ruling clique is terrified of the armed resistance of American blacks. This fully exposes the weak essence of U.S. imperialism.

	The struggle of American blacks is not isolated. They will always receive the boundless sympathy and firm support of the 700 million Chinese people, and they will definitely receive the sympathy and support of all peace-loving people of the world. We are convinced that as long as American blacks unite more closely, join forces with all oppressed peoples and nations, and engage in a head-on struggle against the reactionary policies of U.S. imperialism both domestically and internationally, they will definitely achieve the great victory of complete liberation.

	U.S. imperialism will surely be defeated!

	American blacks will surely be victorious!

    大会通电
    新华社八日讯　首都各界人民反对美帝国主义、支持美国黑人反对种族歧视斗争大会通电，全文如下：
    中国首都北京各界人民今天举行万人大会，隆重纪念中国人民最敬爱的领袖毛泽东主席发表《支持美国黑人反对美帝国主义种族歧视的正义斗争的声明》三周年。
    大会对正在进行反对种族歧视斗争的英勇的美国黑人兄弟，表示崇高的敬意和坚决的支持！对在斗争中遭受迫害的美国黑人兄弟表示衷心的慰问！对残酷迫害和血腥镇压美国黑人的美帝国主义，表示无比的愤怒和强烈的抗议！
    毛主席在三年前发表的这篇声明，闪耀着马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉。毛主席的声明，具有深远的政治影响和重大的历史意义。它是反对美帝国主义种族歧视的伟大战斗号召，它极大地鼓舞了美国黑人的斗志！大会重申，七亿中国人民最坚决地、最热烈地拥护毛主席的声明。
    三年来，美国黑人斗争的发展，证明了毛主席声明中的论断，是十分英明的，是完全正确的，是颠扑不破的真理。
    三年来，美国黑人反对种族歧视的斗争，如同燎原之火，烧遍了整个美国。今年入夏以来，在美国芝加哥等大城市又爆发了一连串黑人武装抗暴斗争。美国黑人斗争开始走上以革命的暴力对付反革命的暴力的道路。这标志着美国黑人斗争进入了一个新的阶段。
    经过几年来斗争的实践，美国黑人的阶级觉悟不断提高，他们日益明显地把斗争矛头指向一小撮美国反动统治集团。美国黑人的斗争日益同美国人民反对美帝侵越战争的运动密切地结合起来。这是对越南人民的抗美救国斗争的极大支持，也是对全世界人民的反美斗争的极大支持。
    帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。美帝国主义已经陷入了世界人民的重重包围之中。它坐在随时会爆发的火山上。美国反动统治集团，对美国黑人的抗暴斗争害怕得要死。这充分暴露了美帝国主义虚弱的本质。
    美国黑人的斗争，绝不是孤立的。他们永远会得到七亿中国人民的无限同情和坚决支持，一定会得到全世界一切爱好和平的人民的同情和支持。我们深信，只要美国黑人更加紧密地团结起来，联合一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族，同美帝国主义对内对外的反动政策，进行针锋相对的斗争，一定能够赢得彻底解放的伟大胜利。
    美帝国主义必败！
    美国黑人必胜！
    首都各界人民反对美帝国主义、支持美国黑人反对种族歧视斗争大会
