From the day the Daqing Oil Field battle began, workers and cadres have been rolling together. Everyone lives together, eats together, works together on the rigs, and plows and cultivates on the grasslands. If workers have so much mud on their bodies, cadres will have just as much mud on theirs. This revolutionary spirit continues to this day. Recently, it has taken another step forward: cadres take turns being workers, implementing the principle of being both workers and cadres.

Workers participate in management, and the masses elect grassroots cadres. Workers are producers and also managers.

We must respond to Chairman Mao's call, continue to strive to narrow the gap between mental and physical labor.

    石油工业部五好标兵、大庆油田运销处副处长　马德仁：
    工人身上多少泥　干部身上多少泥
    从大庆油田会战开始那天起，工人和干部就在一起滚，大家住在一起，吃在一块，一样在井上劳动，在草原上拉犁开荒。工人身上有多少泥，干部身上就有多少泥，直到今天还是这个革命作风。最近又向前发展了一步，干部轮流当工人，实行亦工亦干。
    工人参加管理，群众选举基层干部。工人是生产者，也是管理者。
    我们要响应毛主席的号召，要继续努力缩小脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别。
