The Party Branch of Jiajiacun Production Brigade in Wannianqing People's Commune, Fenyang County, Shanxi Province, leads every matter with Mao Zedong Thought, approaches each issue from a political perspective, handles them seriously, and strives to achieve political results.

"Demoting the Model"

The fourth production team has a street lamp that doesn't work properly. Sixteen-year-old junior high school graduate Song Shoushan climbs the pole every night to turn on the light and every morning to turn it off. By the day of the model evaluation, he had already climbed the pole many times. Therefore, most of the community members unanimously agreed to award him the title of first-class model. The next day, Zhang Wanfu from the agricultural tools repair team requested to "demote the model."

Zhang Wanfu usually performs well, and everyone gave him the title of second-class model. On the day of discussing Song Shoushan's matter, he compared himself to Song and couldn't sleep all night. Originally, he had placed a pile of cabbages in the south room. He was afraid the cabbages would freeze, so he secretly placed a 200-watt bulb in the middle of the pile to "keep warm." This not only wasted state electricity but also reduced the electricity fee, taking advantage of the collective. He felt that the praise for Song Shoushan was a criticism of himself. After a fierce struggle, he decided to "demote the model" and was prepared to accept everyone's criticism.

Zhang Wanfu's mistake should be criticized, but after the Party Branch discussed it, they believed that his voluntary "demotion" was a revolutionary act that should be welcomed. They suggested retaining his title of second-class model. Zhang Wanfu was so moved that he couldn't sleep all night, determined to become a model community member.

The Origin of the Red Manager

Jiajiacun pays great attention to fermenting straw into fertilizer. One day, old man Yan Xingfa said, "We only know how to ferment straw into fertilizer, but what do we burn?" At that time, Communist Party member Yu Baolan was present and criticized him. Then, the Party Branch committee member and deputy brigade leader Fan Yanggao also criticized him. In fact, Yan Xingfa's opinion was correct, and this made him have grievances against the Party Branch.

For this matter, the Party Branch held another discussion and felt that the old man's opinion was correct. However, someone said, "This is an individual's problem, why make a big deal out of it?" But the Party Branch felt that there was a problem of how the Party Branch deals with its own mistakes and a problem of Party-group relations. Therefore, the Party Branch secretary Song Shuxun specially met with old man Yan Xingfa, apologized to him, explained that his opinion was correct, and told him about the brigade's plan to rationally allocate straw, seeking his opinion.

The old man's grievances against the Party Branch were resolved, but he still had reservations about Yu Baolan. The Party Branch then asked Yu Baolan to find a way to solve this problem. Yu Baolan started by caring for Yan Xingfa's life. When the old man ran out of firewood, she picked two baskets of corn and sorghum stalks from the field and sent them to him. When the old man fell ill, she called a doctor, fetched medicine, and boiled it. Yan Xingfa was a seventy-something-year-old widower who had suffered a lot in the past. Thinking about the past and comparing it to the present, he cried. The roots of socialism were deeply planted in his heart. After that, the old man became the brigade's jobless "red manager."

Not Simple

Last year, Song Chengfu pulled manure from the city, and two community members from neighboring brigades sat in his car. When asked which village he was from, he said, "From the famous village." Along the way, people praised Jiajiacun for not being simple, often having people come to visit by car. He proudly said, "Our brigade is indeed not simple! Look, another car is coming to visit." Later, after they left, he even sang, "Jiajiacun is not simple, often having people come to visit. We work late for a few more years, and other brigades won't catch up." At that time, some people thought this was a small matter, but the Party Branch saw it as a sign of backwardness. That day, several committee members went to the production team and personally organized the community members to discuss this "not simple" issue, holding three evening meetings in a row. The Party Branch proposed: Chairman Mao said, "Modesty helps one to make progress, while conceit makes one fall behind." Do we want to listen to Chairman Mao's words? Why should we listen to Chairman Mao's words? How did Jiajiacun achieve its results? Without the Party and Chairman Mao's leadership, without the state's support and the help of neighboring brigades, would we have today's results? Compared to Jiajiacun's future tasks, are today's results big or small? Compared to the advanced brigades in the province, does Jiajiacun have a gap? How should we treat neighboring brigades after becoming advanced? While discussing, they contrasted and learned Chairman Mao's words from "Put Down Your Burden and Start Your Engine."

In this way, all community members had a harvest of thoughts. Through the discussion, everyone's eyes were opened, the achievements were correctly recorded, the gap with Dazhai, Yangtan, Nangliu, and Yangjindong, and other famous advanced brigades was found, and the attitude towards neighboring brigades was corrected.

　　事事从政治出发
　　冯东书　师文宴
    山西汾阳县万年青公社贾家庄大队党支部，对待每一件事情，都用毛泽东思想挂帅，从政治出发，认真处理，务必求得政治效果。
    “退模范”
    第四生产队有一盏路灯，开关不灵。十六岁的高小毕业生宋寿山，每天晚上爬到电杆上把灯扭开，早上又爬到电杆上去关灯。到评模范这一天，他已经连着爬了好多次。因此，大多数社员一致同意把他评为甲等模范。这一评，第二天早上，农具修配队的张万福就要求“退模范”了。
    张万福平时表现好，大家给他评了个乙等模范。这一天讨论宋寿山的事，他对照自己，一夜没睡好。原来，他在南房里放了一堆白菜。他怕把菜冻坏了，就在菜堆中间悄悄放了个二百支光的大电灯“取暖”。这既浪费了国家的电，又少出了电费，占了集体的便宜。他觉得大家对宋寿山的表扬，就是对自己的批评。经过激烈的思想斗争，他下决心要“退模范”，还准备接受大家的批评。
    对张万福的错误要批评，但党支部研究以后认为，他能自觉地“退模范”，是个革命的行动，应该欢迎，建议保留他的乙等模范称号。张万福感动得一夜没睡好，决心要当个响当当的模范社员。
    红管家的来历
    贾家庄很讲究秸秆沤肥。有一天，阎兴发老汉说：“光知道秸秆沤肥，都沤了肥，烧什么？”当时，共产党员于保兰在场，批评了他一顿。接着，大队党支部委员、副大队长范仰高也批评了他。其实，阎兴发的意见是正确的，这一下他就对党支部有意见了。
    为这件事，支部又研究了一次，觉得老汉的意见是对的。可是，有人说，这是一个人的问题，何必小题大作？但是党支部觉得，这中间有个支部怎么对待自己错误的问题，有个党群关系问题。因此，支部书记宋树勋专门找了阎兴发老汉，向他认了错，说明他的意见是对的，还把大队准备合理分配秸秆的办法，对他说了，征求他的意见。
    老人对党支部的意见消除了，对于保兰仍然有隔阂。支部便要求于保兰想办法解决这个问题。于保兰首先从关心阎兴发的生活做起，老汉没有柴烧了，她就从地里拾两筐玉米、高粱茬子给他送去。老汉病了，她给请医生、抓药、熬药。阎兴发是个七十多岁的孤老汉，自小受苦，想想过去，比比现在，哭了。社会主义的根在他心里扎得更深了。自那以后，这位老人就成了大队里没有职务的“红管家”。
    不简单
    前年，宋成富从城里拉粪回来，有两个兄弟队的社员坐他的车，问他是那个村的，他说是“有名村的”。人家一路上夸贾家庄不简单，经常有人坐着大小汽车来参观。他得意地说：“我们队就是不简单嘛！你们看，又来了参观的汽车了。”后来人家走了，他竟唱了起来：“贾家庄不简单，经常有人来参观，我们晚干三二年，其他队也赶不上。”当时有人觉得这是件小事，党支部却把这看成是一种落后的信号。当天几个支委就都到了生产队，亲自组织社员讨论这个“不简单”，一连开了三个晚上的会。党支部提出：毛主席说：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”，大家要不要听毛主席的话，为什么要听毛主席的话；贾家庄的成绩是怎么来的，没有党和毛主席领导，没有国家的支援和兄弟队的帮助，会不会有今天的成绩；同贾家庄今后的任务比，现在的成绩是大还是小；贾家庄同全省先进单位比有没有差距；先进了应该怎样对待兄弟队？一边讨论，一边对照着学毛主席的《放下包袱，开动机器》这一段话。
    这样，全体社员获得了一次思想丰收。经过讨论，大家的眼睛开阔了，成绩账也记对了，同大寨、杨谈、南柳、羊井底等著名先进大队的差距也找出来了，对兄弟队的态度也摆正了。
