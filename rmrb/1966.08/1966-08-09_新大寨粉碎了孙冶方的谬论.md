After reading Sun Yefang's revisionist fallacies, we are extremely indignant. Sun Yefang actually attacks the use of Mao Zedong Thought to lead economic construction, calling it "replacing objective economic laws with the mass line and political leadership," labeling it "subjectivism" and "lazy thinking." This is a vicious slander against the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers who are actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and a wanton attack on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We, the people of Dazhai, will definitely use ironclad facts to smash these revisionist fallacies to pieces.

Poverty-stricken Dazhai in the Old Society

In the old society, the Chinese people had three mountains weighing on their heads, and the peasants had "three knives" on their backs—rent, taxes, and high interest. After a year of hard work, the fruits of the labor of the poor and lower-middle peasants all ended up in the pockets of the landlords and rich peasants.

At that time, Dazhai was famous for its poor land and poor people. The entire village had about eight hundred mu of land, scattered across seven gullies, eight ridges, and one slope. As for the quality of the land, it was truly: "The soil is so hard it can't be broken, and the wind blows it dry everywhere." But even this meager land was mostly seized by the landlords and rich peasants. Other means of production were in a similar situation. The poor and lower-middle peasants had poor land and were poor themselves. After harvesting the grain, they couldn't even afford to pay the rent, taxes, and interest, let alone improve production. Therefore, before liberation, Dazhai's average yield per mu was only about one hundred and twenty to thirty jin, even in a good harvest year.

Organizing Together, Creating Prosperous Dazhai

In August 1945, Dazhai was liberated. From then on, we saw the light of day and became masters of our own fate. Under the Party's leadership, we followed Chairman Mao's instructions. Chairman Mao taught us that to overcome the perpetual poverty of individual economies, the only way is to organize together, gradually collectivize through cooperatives. We resolutely followed this path. The facts told the people of Dazhai that Chairman Mao's instructions were the necessary path from poverty to prosperity. It was precisely through this path that we transformed poverty-stricken Dazhai into prosperous Dazhai.

Socialist collective economy greatly liberated productive forces, creating conditions for developing agricultural production. In the first year of realizing primary cooperativization, Dazhai's average yield per mu was 240 jin. By 1958, it increased to over 500 jin. Since the establishment of the people's commune, the yield has continued to rise each year, reaching over 770 jin in 1962, "crossing the Yellow River"; and over 800 jin in 1964, "crossing the Yangtze River." Without following the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, not only could this not have been achieved, but we wouldn't even dare to think about it.

Self-reliance, Creating New Dazhai

In August 1963, a torrential rain like whips lashed down for seven days and nights, equivalent to the annual rainfall. This devastating disaster destroyed 80% of the farmland, leaving 180 mu of crops with no harvest, 145 caves damaged, 113 collapsed, 125 rooms destroyed, and 77 collapsed. In this critical moment, what did we rely on? We relied on Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao taught us that people's communes are big and public, not only having the greatest capacity for production development but also the greatest capacity to resist natural disasters. Chairman Mao also taught us that we must be self-reliant and strive for strength. We followed these teachings diligently, so although there were great droughts, winds, and rains, people would have great courage, great strategies, and great plans, and no amount of difficulties could stop us. All Party members, cadres, and poor and lower-middle peasants in Dazhai fearlessly fought against the flood, ensuring that people and livestock were unharmed and collective property suffered minimal loss. After the disaster, we did not ask the state for a single grain of rice, a single cent, or a single piece of material. Instead, we stood tall, self-reliant, and rebuilt our homes. In just over a year, we rebuilt socialist New Dazhai to a high standard. The land plots were larger than before, each one neatly levelled, soft, and of significantly improved quality. The changes in housing were even greater. Without mentioning the repairs, we built 60 new stone caves and 148 brick houses. Over 80% of the commune members moved into new houses and caves, and electric lights were installed.

On July 19 of this year, Dazhai Brigade was suddenly hit by a massive storm, severely damaging agricultural infrastructure and causing crops to be severely lodged. However, we will definitely continue to follow Chairman Mao's instructions of self-reliance and striving for strength, and continue to carry forward the unyielding revolutionary spirit. We are currently repairing the washed-away land, rebuilding the damaged stone dams, and propping up the lodged crops. We will definitely continue to highhold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, under the Party's leadership, and utilize the superiority of the people's commune and collective wisdom to overcome disasters and build New Dazhai.

The Invincible Power of Mao Zedong Thought

What power enabled the people of Dazhai to create these miracles? Ultimately, it is the result of Mao Zedong Thought taking the lead. Now, the cadres of Dazhai all understand: forget everything, but do not forget to study Chairman Mao's works. Through studying Chairman Mao's works, the poor and lower-middle peasants and the broad masses of commune members have seen farther, thought broader, and established the idea of farming for the revolution. Red thoughts lead to success in all endeavors. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought dare to change the world.

Dazhai is just one point in the country. Throughout the country, there are Dazhais, and the poor and lower-middle peasants and the broad masses of commune members all take Chairman Mao's words as their guiding direction. As long as Chairman Mao says so, we will do so, which can make agricultural economy develop boundlessly and bring about earth-shaking changes in the countryside. This is something that Sun Yefang and all the bourgeois gentlemen will never understand in their lifetime.

Without Mao Zedong Thought, there would be no Dazhai today, and there would be no victory in socialist construction. We, the people of Dazhai, are determined to turn Dazhai into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought, build the socialist new countryside better, and trample on Sun Yefang and all anti-Party, anti-socialist elements, making sure they never rise again.

    新大寨粉碎了孙冶方的谬论
    山西省昔阳县大寨大队党支部书记　陈永贵
    看了孙冶方的修正主义谬论，我们非常气愤。孙冶方竟然攻击用毛泽东思想挂帅搞经济建设是“把群众路线和政治挂帅来代替客观经济规律”，是“唯心论”、“懒汉思想”。这是对广大工农兵群众活学活用毛主席著作的恶毒污蔑，是对威力无穷的毛泽东思想的猖狂进攻。我们大寨人一定要用铁的事实，把这种修正主义谬论砸得粉碎。
    旧社会的穷大寨
    在旧社会里，中国人民头上有三座大山，农民背上有“三把刀”——交租、纳税、利钱高。贫下中农辛勤劳动一年，果实都流进了地主、富农的腰包。
    那时的大寨，是以地穷、人穷出名的。全村八百来亩土地，分散在七沟、八梁、一面坡上。说到地的质量，那真是：“土块打不烂，风吹遍地干”。但是，就这点瘦地也大部分被地主、富农所霸占。别的生产资料，占有情况也和土地差不多。贫下中农地瘦、人穷，打下粮食不够交租、纳税、还利钱，哪能搞好生产呢？所以解放前大寨的平均亩产量，就是碰上好收成，也不过一百二、三十斤。
    组织起来，有了富大寨
    一九四五年八月，大寨解放了。我们从此见了天日，当了主人。我们在党的领导下，按照毛主席的指示办事。毛主席教导我们，要克服个体经济永远穷苦的状况，唯一的道路就是组织起来，经过合作社，逐渐地集体化。我们坚决地照着办了。事实告诉大寨人，毛主席的这一指示，是由穷苦变富裕的必由之路。我们就是首先靠这一条，把穷大寨变成了富大寨。
    社会主义的集体经济大大地解放了生产力，为发展农业生产创造了条件。大寨村在实现初级合作化的第一年，平均亩产二百四十斤。一九五八年，上升到五百多斤。人民公社化以来，更是年年往上升，一九六二年达到七百七十多斤，“过了黄河”；一九六四年又增长到八百多斤，“跨过了长江”。要不是按照毛主席指出的方向前进，这不仅不能实现，就是想也不敢想。
    自力更生，有了新大寨
    一九六三年八月，鞭杆似的暴雨下了七天七夜，等于常年一年的降雨量。这场毁灭性的灾害，使百分之八十的农田受到破坏，有一百八十亩庄稼无收成，一百四十五孔窑坏了一百一十三孔，一百二十五间房倒了七十七间。就是没有倒塌的房和窑，墙也裂了缝，不能住人了。在这个严重关头，我们靠什么？我们靠的仍然是毛泽东思想。毛主席教导我们，人民公社一大二公，不仅有最大的发展生产的能力，而且有最大的抗拒自然灾害的能力。毛主席又教导我们，必须自力更生，奋发图强。我们扎扎实实地按照这些教导办事，因此虽然天有大旱大风大雨，人却会有大勇大谋大计，再多的困难也难不住我们。我们大寨的全体党员、干部和贫下中农奋不顾身地和洪水搏斗，终于使人、牲畜无伤亡，集体的财产也损失很少。受灾后，我们没有要国家一斤粮、一元钱、一件物资，而是挺起腰杆，自力更生，重建家园。只经过一年多时间，我们用高标准重新建设了社会主义的新大寨。地块比过去大了，块块都是齐刷刷、平整整、软绵绵，质量大有提高。住房变化更大，整修旧的不说，新建的就有青石窑六十孔，砖瓦房一百四十八间。百分之八十以上的社员搬进了新房、新窑，还安上了电灯。
    今年七月十九日，大寨大队又突然遭受了特大的狂洪暴雨的袭击，使农田基本建设遭到严重破坏，庄稼严重倒伏。但是，我们一定要继续按照毛主席的自力更生、奋发图强的指示办事，一定要继续发扬志不屈、旗不倒的革命精神。我们正在把冲走的地修起来，把冲坏的石坝砌起来，把冲倒的庄稼扶起来。我们一定能一如既往地高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在党的领导下，发挥人民公社的优越性和集体智慧，战胜灾害，建设新大寨。
    毛泽东思想威力无穷
    是什么力量使大寨人能够创造这些奇迹的呢？九九归一说到底，是毛泽东思想挂帅的结果。现在，大寨的干部都懂得：忘了啥也不能忘记学习毛主席著作。贫下中农和广大社员群众通过学习毛主席著作，看得远了，想得宽了，树立了为革命种田的思想。思想红，百事成。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，敢教日月换新天。
    大寨只是全国的一个点，全国各地有大寨，全国各地的贫下中农和广大社员群众都把毛主席的话当作指导方向。只要毛主席怎么说，咱就怎么做，这就能使农业经济有不可限量的发展，就能使农村有翻天覆地的变化。这一点是孙冶方和一切资产阶级老爷们一辈子也不可能理解的。
    没有毛泽东思想，就没有今天的大寨，就没有社会主义建设的胜利。我们大寨人决心把大寨办成毛泽东思想的大学校，把社会主义新农村建设得更好，把孙冶方及一切反党反社会主义分子统统踩在脚下，让他们永远不得翻身。
