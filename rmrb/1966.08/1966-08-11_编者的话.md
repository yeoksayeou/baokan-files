The Editor's Words

“Profit as the guiding principle” is the core of Sun Yefang’s revisionist economic program. Under the banner of “profit as the guiding principle,” he opposes the banner of proletarian politics, attempting to restore capitalism in our country and change the color of our nation. Sun Yefang’s evil intentions have aroused the extreme indignation of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, who have risen up to attack him.

The articles published today are all based on the authors’ practical experiences in production struggles. Through ironclad facts, they demonstrate that in production, implementing the principle of politics in command, which is the same as implementing the principle of Mao Zedong Thought in command, can fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the laboring people, adhere to the socialist direction, and make the cause of socialist construction flourish even more. Conversely, implementing “profit as the guiding principle” and material incentives will corrupt the revolutionary will of the laboring people and lead enterprises and people’s communes astray.

We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and smash the black banner of Sun Yefang’s “profit as the guiding principle.” Every production unit must implement the principle of proletarian politics in command, promote the revolutionization of people’s thinking, promote the revolutionization of enterprises, seize the revolution, and promote production, making both the revolution and production better and better.

    编者的话
    “利润挂帅”是孙冶方修正主义经济纲领的核心。他打着“利润挂帅”的黑旗，反对无产阶级政治挂帅的红旗，妄图在我国实行资本主义复辟，改变我们国家的颜色。孙冶方的罪恶目的，激起了广大工农兵群众的无比愤怒，群起而攻之。
    今天发表的几篇文章，都是作者在生产斗争中的实际体验，他们通过铁一般的事实说明：在生产中，实行政治挂帅，也就是毛泽东思想挂帅，就能充分调动劳动人民的积极性，就能坚持社会主义方向，使社会主义建设事业兴旺更兴旺。反之，实行什么“利润挂帅”，搞物质刺激，就会腐蚀劳动人民的革命意志，就会使企业和人民公社走到邪路上去。
    我们一定要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，粉碎孙冶方“利润挂帅”的黑旗。我们每个生产单位都要实行无产阶级政治挂帅，促进人的思想革命化，促进企业的革命化，抓革命，促生产，把革命和生产搞得好上加好。
