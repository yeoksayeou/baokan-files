One evening, as we were having dinner, the battalion commander hurriedly came to us and told the messenger, Little Wang, "Quickly finish your dinner. You have to deliver the order to the Eighth Company within forty minutes and have them withdraw." Upon hearing the task, Little Wang quickly stuffed the half-bowl of sorghum rice he hadn't finished into his waist pouch and rushed off towards the Eighth Company's position like the wind.

At that time, we were more than seven miles away from the Eighth Company's position, and we had to cross two mountains along the way. It was also getting dark. To complete the task on time, Little Wang kept his head down and ran as fast as he could. Suddenly, he looked up and saw a group of American devils about twenty meters away approaching him. The Americans, upon seeing Little Wang, started shouting and rushed towards him, apparently intending to capture him. Little Wang, upon seeing the enemy, became extremely enraged and was ready to fight to the death with these bandits. However, he suddenly thought, if I fight to the death with the enemy, who will complete the task of delivering the order? Therefore, he immediately decided not to act recklessly! Little Wang quickly thought of a plan and threw his bowl pouch out. The Americans, seeing a dark object flying towards them, thought it was a hand grenade! They were so terrified that they lay on the ground, not daring to move. Seizing this opportunity, Little Wang jumped into a nearby trench and walked away.

This group of stupid enemies waited for a long time but didn't hear the explosion of the hand grenade. They cautiously lifted their heads. By the time they realized that what was thrown at them was not a hand grenade but a bowl pouch containing half a bowl of sorghum rice, Little Wang had already crossed a mountain. Hearing the chaotic gunshots behind him, he couldn't help but laugh and said to himself, "My new 'weapon' really has some power!"

    半碗高粱米饭
    前志愿军某部电话兵　赵洪林
    一天傍晚，我们入朝作战部队正吃晚饭，营长匆匆来到我们面前，对通信员小王说：“你快吃完饭，在四十分钟内，要把命令送到八连，让他们撤下来。”小王一听有任务，随手把没吃完的半碗高粱米饭，往腰间的饭碗袋里一塞，就一溜风似地朝八连阵地跑去。
    当时，我们离八连阵地有七里多路，途中还要翻过两座山。天又快黑了。为了按时完成任务，小王一个劲地低头猛跑。猛一抬头，忽然看见一群美国鬼子在二十米远的地方向他走来。美国鬼子一见到小王，便咿哩哇啦地蜂拥而上，看架势是想抓他。小王一见敌人，分外眼红，正想豁出性命和这群强盗拚了。但是，他忽然又想到，我要跟敌人拚了，谁来完成传达命令的任务呢？于是，他马上决定，不能蛮干！小王灵机一动，随手解开碗袋扔了出去。美国鬼子看见一个黑乎乎的东西迎面飞来，还认为是手榴弹呢！一个个吓得魂不附体，爬在地上，动也不敢动。趁这机会，小王跳进身旁的交通沟里走了。
    这群愚蠢的敌人，等了半天也没听到手榴弹的爆炸声，一个个才战战兢兢地抬起头来。等他们看清扔过来的不是手榴弹，而是装着半碗高粱米饭的碗袋时，小王早已爬过了一座山。听着身后敌人乱七八糟的枪声，他忍不住好笑，自言自语地说：“我这个新式‘武器’还真有威力哩！”
