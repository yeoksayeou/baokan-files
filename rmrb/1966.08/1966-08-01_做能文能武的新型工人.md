Editor's Note: After reading the following articles, we see in these workers, peasants, soldiers, and students the emergence of a new type of person nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, a person who strives for communism. In great socialist China, people in all walks of life, whether they are workers, peasants, soldiers, students, or employees in commerce, services, or government agencies, are first and foremost revolutionaries. The revolutionary cause demands that they all study politics, study military affairs, and study culture. They must all criticize the bourgeoisie, and under possible conditions, they must focus on their main profession while also learning other skills. They must all become new people who are both literate and martial, who are both workers and farmers. This new type of person is one who is fully armed with Mao Zedong Thought. To make all industries into revolutionary schools, we must prioritize the task of educating and transforming people with Mao Zedong Thought.

People are the decisive factor. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "As long as there are people, any miracle in the world can be created." To create the miracle of a communist society, we must first cultivate new people who strive for the great ideal of communism.

Becoming a New Type of Worker Who is Both Literate and Martial

National People's Congress Representative, Worker of the Sixth Construction Engineering Company of Hunan Province, Liu Zhengliang

The People's Liberation Army is a military force created by Chairman Mao. This army is a shining example for the entire nation to learn from. Recently, Chairman Mao has issued the directive to build the army into a communist university, which is a severe blow to imperialism, reactionaries of all countries, and modern revisionism. We workers must also follow Chairman Mao's directive and become revolutionary fighters who can wield a gun to fight, a pen to write, and a tool to build walls.

I am a construction worker. In the old society, I attended three years of primary school. Bourgeois elements say: "The working class is the most ignorant and stupid." Under the long-term oppression and deception of the bourgeoisie, I also had insufficient understanding of the great creative power of the working class, and I also believed in the authority of the bourgeoisie. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, I attended a few years of night school. Later, I studied Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao has the highest evaluation of us workers and peasants. Chairman Mao's words have boosted the morale of the working people and encouraged us to become thorough revolutionaries. Because I prioritize the study of Chairman Mao's works, studying every day, Mao Zedong Thought has made my brain more and more agile. I have come to understand that scientific theory is not something mysterious and unattainable. Advanced experience contains scientific principles, and summarizing them is theory.

In 1957, we participated in discussions on some drafts of construction operation procedures written by engineering and technical personnel. There were many foreign words and phrases that no one could understand. The leaders asked me to rewrite on this topic. Initially, picking up a pen was much heavier than picking up a trowel, but this is a task given by the Party. Can a communist party member shrink back in the face of difficulties? No. I made up my mind to write. The draft was discussed by veteran workers, and everyone said that such an operation procedure is plain, specific, and easy to understand, much better than what the engineers wrote. Later, I also wrote books such as "Advanced Experience of Masonry in Hunan Province." Practice has proven that Chairman Mao's teaching, "If you want to know the taste of a pear, you have to change the pear and taste it yourself," is indeed the truth.

Last year, the state planned to renovate the Changde Cotton Mill. At that time, some people advocated tearing down the factory and rebuilding it. At this time, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao issued the great call for a design revolution. The provincial party committee organized a team to go to the site for investigation, and we proposed a "strengthening and utilizing" design plan. But some "authorities" insisted on tearing down and rebuilding, saying, "Just tear it down, after all, the state has invested hundreds of millions of yuan, building a concrete structure factory is good." We said, "Building a new factory is good, but two million square meters of factory area, the hard work of thousands of workers, and the state's large amount of resources, all torn down, isn't that a waste? Spinning good yarn, weaving good cloth, is it people or the factory? Money, this money is the wealth of socialism, every penny must be used to the fullest." With the support of the provincial party committee leaders, our proposal prevailed.

New things always grow in the midst of struggle. Many people opposed our plan, saying it was not in the books, it did not pass the standards. At this time, we remembered Chairman Mao's teachings. Chairman Mao said, "In the realm of production struggle and scientific experimentation, humanity is constantly developing, and nature is also constantly developing, never stopping at one level. Therefore, humanity must constantly summarize experience, discover, invent, create, and progress." These teachings gave us immense strength and courage. Everyone said: Listen to Chairman Mao's words, and we can blaze a trail that neither the ancients nor the foreigners have ever walked!

The bourgeois "authorities" argued with us, focusing on the small piles, saying it did not conform to foreign standards. We replied, "We follow Chairman Mao's teachings, everything must start from specific conditions. This factory is not high, the load is not heavy, and the vibration is not great. Based on these conditions, twenty centimeters thick concrete hollow piles have a very large safety factor." To refute them with facts, we conducted pressure tests on the piles, proving that our design was correct. Those bourgeois "authorities" were silenced in the face of facts. We won. This is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

In the past, the bourgeois "authorities" always said that we working people had no knowledge and looked down on us. Now that we have mastered Mao Zedong Thought, we are a million times more brilliant than those bourgeois "authorities."

### 做能文能武的新型工人

专栏：

    编者按：读了下面几篇文章，我们从这些工人、农民、战士、学生们的身上，看到了在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的全新的人，为共产主义而奋斗的新人的萌芽。
    在伟大的社会主义中国，各行各业的人，不管是工人、农民、战士、学生还是商业、服务行业、机关工作人员，他们首先是个革命者。革命的任务要求他们都要学政治、学军事、学文化，都要批判资产阶级，在可能的条件下，都要以本业为主，兼攻别业，都要成为能文能武亦工亦农的全面发展的新人。这种新人，就是完全用毛泽东思想武装起来的人。全国各行各业要成为革命化的大学校，就要把用毛泽东思想教育人，改造人的任务放在第一位。
    人的因素第一。毛泽东同志说：“只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。”我们要造出共产主义社会这样的奇迹，首先就要造就为共产主义的伟大理想而奋斗的新人。
    做能文能武的新型工人
    全国人民代表大会代表、湖南省第六建筑工程公司工人　刘正良
    人民解放军是毛主席亲手缔造出来的军队。这支军队是全国人民学习的光辉榜样。最近，毛主席又提出了要把部队建设成共产主义大学校的指示，这对帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义是一个严重的打击。我们工人也要按毛主席的指示，成为一个拿起枪杆子能打仗，拿起笔杆子能写文章，拿起工具能砌墙的能文能武的革命战士。
    我是一个建筑工人。在旧社会，读了三年小学。资产阶级分子说：“劳动人民最无知、最笨。”在资产阶级长期压迫和愚弄下，对于劳动人民本身的伟大创造力，我也是认识不足的，我也迷信资产阶级“权威”。解放后，在党和毛主席领导下，我读了几年业余学校。后来学习毛主席著作，毛主席对我们工人农民评价最高，毛主席的话，长了我们劳动人民的志气，鼓励我们要做一个彻底革命派。因为我把学习毛主席著作摆在第一位，天天学，毛泽东思想使我的脑子越来越灵了，使我懂得科学理论并不是神秘得不可捉摸的，先进经验里就有科学道理，把它总结出来，就是理论。
    一九五七年，我们参加讨论一些工程技术人员写的有关建筑操作规程初稿。里面有不少洋文、洋话，大家都看不懂，领导同志要我就这个主题重新试写。开始拿起笔杆子可比拿砌刀重得多，但这是党交给的任务，一个共产党员，在困难面前能畏缩吗？不能。我下定决心，一定要写。初稿请老工人讨论，大家都说这样的操作规程通俗、具体、好懂，比那些工程师写的强得多。后来我还写了《湖南省泥工先进经验》等书。实践证明，毛主席教导的“你要知道梨子的滋味，你就得变革梨子，亲口吃一吃”这句话，的确是真理。
    去年，国家计划改建常德棉纺厂。当时有人主张把厂房推倒重建。这时，党中央和毛主席发出了设计革命的伟大号召。省委要我们组织小组去现场调查，我们提出一个“加固利用”的设计方案。但有些“权威”坚持推倒重建，说：“拆掉算了，反正国家给了几百万元的投资，建个水泥结构的厂房多好。”我们说：“建个新厂房当然好，但两万多平方米面积的厂房，几千工人的辛勤劳动，国家大量的物资，统统推倒，难道不可惜吗？纺好纱，织好布，是靠人？还是靠厂房？有钱，这钱是社会主义的财富，一分一厘都要用到刀口上。”在省委领导同志的支持下，我们的主张占了上风。
    新的事物总是在斗争中不断成长的。不少人反对我们的方案，说这个书本上没有，那个规范上通不过。这时，我们想起了毛主席的教导。毛主席说：“在生产斗争和科学实验范围内，人类总是不断发展的，自然界也总是不断发展的，永远不会停止在一个水平上。因此，人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。”这些教导给了我们无比的力量和勇气。大家说：听毛主席的话，就能闯出一条古人洋人所没有走过的路来！
    资产阶级“权威”老爷们，同我们争论的焦点是桩子小，说什么“不符合外国的规范”。我们回答：“我们按照毛主席教导，一切都要从具体情况出发。这个厂房不高，负荷不重，震动不大，根据这些条件来计算，二十厘米粗的水泥空心围桩，还有很大的安全系数。”为了用事实驳倒他们，我们对桩子进行试压，证明我们的设计是正确的。那些资产阶级“权威”老爷们，在事实面前再不作声了。我们胜利了。这是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    过去资产阶级“权威”老爷们，总是说我们劳动人民没有知识，看不起我们，现在我们掌握了毛泽东思想，就比那些资产阶级“权威”老爷们高明千万倍。
