We met our most beloved leader Chairman Mao!

We, representing the revolutionary teachers and students of the Central Conservatory of Music, participated in the rally celebrating the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. On the Tiananmen Rostrum, we saw our most beloved leader Chairman Mao!

Our beloved leader Chairman Mao waved to us and walked towards us with a smile. He was dressed in a brand-new cotton military uniform, with a "Red Guard" armband on his left arm. He was full of vigor, radiant, and in excellent health! This is indeed the greatest happiness for all the people of China and the world! When Chairman Mao came to our side, our blood boiled, tears welled up in our eyes, and we couldn't help but shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!" Our voices were hoarse from shouting, and our hands were red from clapping. No words could express our overwhelming emotions. In this unprecedented Cultural Revolution, our beloved leader Chairman Mao personally leads us forward bravely. Today, he received us, giving us revolutionary teachers and students great encouragement and strength.

On the Tiananmen Rostrum, we, representing all the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of the entire school, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao and presented it along with a red armband that reads "Red Guards of the Central Conservatory of Music." The letter said: "Dear Chairman Mao, please rest assured! We will definitely read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions. We will seriously study, implement, master, and apply the Party Central Committee's Sixteen Points. We will forever be your good students, following you through stormy seas!"

Our beloved leader Chairman Mao and other leaders of the Party Central Committee received us twice and took photos with us. Premier Zhou also had a cordial conversation with us and personally directed us to sing "The Boat Needs a Helmsman" and "We Are Marching on the Great Road."

Our beloved great leader and teacher Chairman Mao cares so much for the growth of revolutionary successors, which makes us feel even more responsible. We are all descendants of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary soldiers, and revolutionary martyrs. The country won with the blood of our forefathers is now in our hands. Today, we are the masters of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We have the ambition and determination to follow Chairman Mao through storms and waves to grow and become stronger!

Dearest Chairman Mao, please rest assured. Your great encouragement and support have greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary masses and added boundless fighting strength to us. With the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, we fear no difficulties or storms. We once again declare to the beloved Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao: We will definitely master Mao Zedong Thought, break through all obstacles, sweep away all monsters and demons, and achieve the final victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!
Long live the Communist Party of China!
Long live Chairman Mao!
Long live the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!

　　我们见到了最最敬爱的领袖毛主席
    我们代表中央音乐学院的革命师生参加了庆祝无产阶级文化大革命群众大会。在天安门主席台上，见到了我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席！
    敬爱的领袖毛主席向我们招手，微笑着向我们走来。他老人家穿着一套崭新的布军装，左臂上戴着“红卫兵”袖章，精神焕发，满面红光，身体非常健康！这真是我们全中国人民和全世界人民的最大幸福啊！当毛主席来到我们身边时，我们的热血沸腾，热泪盈眶，情不自禁地高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！”我们的嗓子都喊哑了，手都拍红了，千言万语也表达不出我们万分激动的心情。在这场史无前例的文化大革命中，敬爱的领袖毛主席亲自带领我们奋勇前进，今天又接见了我们，给了我们革命师生极大的鼓舞和力量。
    我们在天安门主席台上，代表全院革命师生员工给毛主席写了一封信，连同一个写有“中央音乐学院红色尖兵”的红袖章一起送给了毛主席。信中写道：“敬爱的毛主席，请您放心吧！我们一定读您的书，听您的话，按照您的指示办事，认真学习、贯彻、掌握、运用党中央的十六条决定，我们要永远做您的好学生，跟着您在大风大浪中前进！”
    敬爱的领袖毛主席和党中央其他领导同志两次接见了我们，又和我们一起照了像，周总理还和我们亲切地谈了话，亲自指挥我们唱了《大海航行靠舵手》、《我们走在大路上》。
    我们敬爱的伟大领袖和导师毛主席对革命后代的成长这样关怀备至，更使我们感到肩上的重担。我们都是工人、贫下中农、革命干部、革命军人、革命烈士的后代，父辈用鲜血打下的江山交在我们手中了，今天，我们就是无产阶级文化大革命的主人，我们有志气，有雄心，一定要跟着毛主席在惊涛骇浪中锻炼，成长！
    最最敬爱的毛主席，请您放心吧，您对我们的巨大鼓舞和支持，大大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，给我们增添了无穷的战斗力量。我们有伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导，任何艰难困苦、惊涛骇浪也不怕。我们再一次向敬爱的党中央和毛主席表示：我们一定要把毛泽东思想真正学到手，打破一切阻力，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，取得无产阶级文化大革命的最后胜利。
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！万万岁！
    中央音乐学院“红色尖兵战斗队”代表
