	Asian and African figures warmly praise the greatest revolutionary leader of our time, Chairman Mao, the savior of the oppressed people. To make a revolution, one must study the works of Chairman Mao.

	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 17th, people from various circles in Japan, Nepal, Syria, and Palestine have enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao as the greatest revolutionary leader of our time, calling "The Selected Works of Mao Zedong" a comprehensive guide to revolution. They also highly evaluate China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Japanese representative of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, Chairman Nakajima Takezō, spoke to an audience of 600 people in Tokyo on the 15th, saying, "Chairman Mao Zedong is a great figure." He said, "Mao Zedong Thought is completely correct." He praised "The Selected Works of Mao Zedong" as a comprehensive guide to revolution, saying, "There is no book in the world with as wide an application as 'The Selected Works of Mao Zedong'."

	Nepalese representative Govinda Bhatta, who participated in the Asian-African Writers' Emergency Conference, told a Xinhua News Agency reporter in Kathmandu on the 15th, "Chairman Mao's works are a great guide for all revolutionary workers today, because they contain the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism, and the Chinese revolution has proven this."

	Bhatta said, Chairman Mao's judgments "have great significance for those fighting against imperialism, old and new colonialism, and revisionism in various countries. We can be sure that by fully mastering his analysis of revolutionary strategy and applying it in practice, we can achieve victory in the movement. Chairman Mao's brilliant analysis combined with his rich revolutionary experience makes his works full of scientific correctness and truth. Chairman Mao is indeed a great teacher and leader of our time. Without studying Chairman Mao's works, no revolutionary can fully understand the problems of today."

	Syrian writer Zadat Rikaibi, who recently participated in the Asian-African Writers' Emergency Conference, told a Xinhua News Agency reporter, "Mao Zedong is the founder of socialist New China, the beloved leader of 700 million Chinese people; Mao Zedong is the savior of all oppressed nations and peoples in the world; he is the leader of the world people's anti-imperialist cause. People struggling for liberation under imperialist oppression all deeply respect and admire Mao Zedong."

	He added, today, Chairman Mao's works are not only being studied by all the people of China, but also by people all over the world. More and more people are recognizing the greatness of Mao Zedong Thought, and people will unite and follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao to fight against imperialism.

	A Syrian employee, after studying Chairman Mao's works, said, "Mao Zedong Thought is like a torch, illuminating the revolutionary path for the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America."

	A Palestinian youth in exile in Syria, upon seeing Chinese friends for the first time, shouted, "Mao Zedong is the greatest person in the world!" He enthusiastically invited the Chinese friends to his home, excitedly showing them a well-worn Arabic edition of Chairman Mao's works, "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," which he had kept for a long time. He also asked the Chinese friends to give him a photo of Chairman Mao so that he could see Chairman Mao every day.

	Palestinian poet Abu Salama, in his poem, passionately praises Chairman Mao. In his poem "The Smile of Mao Zedong," he writes:

	When darkness covers the sky,
	A storm immediately sweeps through the universe;
	When Mao Zedong's smile appears on the horizon,
	The earth instantly presents a clear sky for ten thousand miles.

　　亚非人士热情歌颂当代最伟大的革命领袖
　　毛主席是被压迫人民的救星
    干革命就要学习毛主席著作
    据新华社十七日讯  日本、尼泊尔、叙利亚、巴勒斯坦各界人士热情称颂毛主席是当代最伟大的革命领袖，《毛泽东选集》是革命的百科全书。他们还高度评价中国的无产阶级文化大革命。
    参加亚非作家紧急会议的日中文化交流协会理事长中岛健藏十五日在东京向六百名听众发表讲话时说，毛泽东主席是“一位伟大人物”。他说，毛泽东思想是完全正确的。他赞扬《毛泽东选集》是革命的百科全书，他说：“世界上再没有像《毛泽东选集》的应用范围那样广泛的书籍了”。
    参加亚非作家紧急会议的尼泊尔代表戈温达·巴塔，十五日在加德满都对新华社记者说：“毛主席的著作是今天全体革命工作者的伟大指南，因为它包含马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，中国革命的具体实践证明了这一点。”
    巴塔说，毛主席的论断“对于在各国进行反对帝国主义、新老殖民主义和修正主义的斗争的人们有着巨大的意义。我们可以肯定，充分掌握他对革命战略的剖析并运用于实践，就能够在运动中取得胜利。毛主席的英明的分析加上他的丰富的革命经验，使他的著作充满了科学的正确性和真理。毛主席确实是当代的伟大导师和伟大领袖。不学习毛主席著作，任何一个革命者都不能充分了解当代的问题。”
    曾经参加亚非作家紧急会议的叙利亚作家扎达特·里卡比最近对新华社记者说：“毛泽东是社会主义新中国的缔造者，七亿中国人民热爱的领袖；毛泽东是全世界被压迫民族和人民的救星；是世界人民反对帝国主义事业的领导者，在帝国主义压迫下正在争取解放的人民都无限尊敬和崇仰毛泽东。”
    他又说，今天，毛主席的著作，不但全中国人民在学习，全世界人民也在学习。认识毛泽东思想伟大的人越来越多，人民将团结起来，沿着毛主席指引的方向，进行反对帝国主义的斗争。
    一位叙利亚职员在学习了毛主席著作以后说，毛泽东思想像火炬，照亮了亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民革命的道路。
    流亡在叙利亚的一位巴勒斯坦青年，第一次见到中国朋友就高呼：“毛泽东是世界上最伟大的人！”他热情地把中国朋友请到他家去，激动地出示一本珍藏很久、阅读得书页已经发皱的阿拉伯文版的毛主席著作：《中国革命和中国共产党》。他还要中国朋友送他一张毛主席照片，以便他能天天见到毛主席。
    巴勒斯坦的著名诗人艾布·赛勒马在他的诗篇中满怀激情地赞颂毛主席。他在《毛泽东的微笑里》一诗中写道：
    当黑暗遮住苍穹，
    宇宙间立刻卷起狂风；
    当毛泽东的微笑露在天边，
    大地上顿时呈现万里晴空。
