The Beijing International Table Tennis Invitational team competition concluded tonight after four days of intense and friendly matches. When the Chinese men's and women's table tennis teams both won the team championships, the entire audience erupted in cheers, celebrating the new victories achieved by our athletes under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. The Japanese men's and women's teams and the North Korean men's and women's teams took second and third places, respectively.

A report from Xinhua News Agency on the 30th: The 1966 Beijing International Table Tennis Invitational men's and women's team competitions, after four days of intense and friendly matches, concluded successfully tonight. When the Chinese men's and women's table tennis teams both won the team championships, the entire audience erupted in cheers, celebrating the new victories achieved by our athletes under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. The Japanese men's and women's teams both secured second place.

Nurtured under Mao Zedong Thought, our Chinese men's and women's table tennis athletes demonstrated a revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win in tonight's matches against their final opponents, the Japanese men's and women's teams, for the team championships. They played with outstanding style and skill, ultimately winning 5-0 and 3-1, respectively. The audience erupted in applause, and people spontaneously shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" They enthusiastically praised the Chinese men's and women's teams for winning the championships again, calling it a new achievement in learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought and another great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

Tonight's men's and women's team championship matches were of world-class level. Throughout the approximately four-hour, heart-pounding competition, the roar of applause from the stands echoed continuously. The Chinese team members who competed in the men's team event—Zhuang Zedong, Li Furen (originally Li Furong), and Zhou Lanxun—and those who competed in the women's team event—Lin Huiqing and Zheng Min—had earlier defeated the North Korean men's and women's teams 5-0 and 3-0, respectively, this afternoon. They did not waste a single moment, studying Chairman Mao's relevant quotations to further arm themselves. Therefore, in tonight's matches, they played exceptionally bravely and tenaciously. In the women's competition, China's two pen-hold backhand players, Lin Huiqing and Zheng Min, demonstrated their exquisite skills against the world champion Fumiko Fukushima and the world-renowned attacker Kyoko Yamazaki. The most thrilling match was Zheng Min's first game against Yamazaki, which lasted about fifty minutes before Zheng Min won 2-1. In the first set, when the score was 18-20, they had already played for fifteen minutes, the time limit, and began using the "alternating serve" method. Later, when the score reached 26-28, Zheng Min lost the set. Despite being down 0-1, Zheng Min remained composed, returning Yamazaki's powerful topspin shots one by one with her tenacious fighting spirit and revolutionary spirit, ultimately winning the next two sets and securing the victory. She received a storm of applause and praise from the entire audience.

In the men's team competition, the Chinese team, consisting of Zhuang Zedong, Li Furen, and Zhou Lanxun, also displayed the daring and fearless style of the "little tigers," defeating the Japanese team, composed of Nobuyuki Hasegawa, Manji Fukushima, and Yuji Aikawa, 5-0.

Throughout the four days of competition, the athletes from various countries demonstrated a tenacious fighting spirit and high level of skill. Before their decisive matches against the Chinese men's and women's teams, the Japanese men's and women's teams had defeated the North Korean men's and women's teams 5-2 and 3-0, respectively.

Many young players from various countries, despite some of them competing for the first time, showed a fearless and daring spirit, demonstrating the rapid growth of new forces in table tennis around the world.

After the team competitions concluded, an award ceremony was held. When the athletes from the top three teams in the men's and women's competitions ascended the podium, the audience erupted in prolonged applause. The first-time participants, the Yemeni delegation leader A. Shandani and the Palestinian delegation leader S. Shurafa, presented the trophies and medals to the top three teams in the women's competition: China, Japan, and North Korea. The Sri Lankan delegation leader A. Vithiyalingam and the Nepalese delegation leader G. P. Lohani presented the trophies and medals to the top three teams in the men's competition: China, Japan, and North Korea. Finally, the entire audience stood and sang "The East Is Red" in unison, accompanied by the orchestra.

The five individual events of this invitational tournament will begin on September 1st.

    北京国际乒乓球邀请赛团体赛结束
    我男女乒乓球队双获团体冠军
    全场欢呼我国健儿在毛泽东思想指引下取得的新胜利
    日本男女队和朝鲜男女队分获团体赛第二三名
    新华社三十日讯　一九六六年北京国际乒乓球邀请赛男女团体赛，经过四天激烈而友好的比赛，今晚胜利结束。当中国男女乒乓球队双双荣获团体冠军时，全场观众沸腾起来，欢呼我国乒乓球健儿在毛泽东思想指引下所取得的新胜利。日本男女队双双获得亚军。
    在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的我国男女乒乓球健儿，今晚同最后一个对手——日本男女队争夺团体冠军时，发扬了敢于斗争，敢于胜利的革命精神，出色地打出了风格，打出了水平，最后分别以五比○和三比一取得胜利。这时，全场掌声雷动，人们情不自禁地欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”热烈赞扬中国男女队再获冠军，是学用毛泽东思想的新成就，是毛泽东思想的又一次伟大胜利。
    今晚的男女团体赛冠军争夺战，是一次具有世界高水平的比赛。在历时约四个小时的扣人心弦的比赛中，看台上的响亮掌声一阵接着一阵。中国队出战男子团体赛的庄则栋、李富勇（原名李富荣）和周兰荪，出战女子团体赛的林慧卿和郑敏之，今天下午分别以五比○和三比○战胜朝鲜男女队后，他们不放过一分一秒的时间，抓紧学习了毛主席的有关语录，进一步武装了自己的头脑。因此在今晚的比赛中，打得格外勇猛顽强。在女子比赛中，中国的两名横拍选手林慧卿和郑敏之，面对世界冠军深津尚子和世界名手山中教子两名攻击型选手，表演了以柔克刚的精彩球艺。最早出场比赛的郑敏之对山中的一盘，最为精彩，双方鏖战约五十分钟后，郑敏之才以二比一取胜。在第一局比赛中，郑敏之同山中打到十八比二十的时候，已经打满了十五分钟的时限，开始采用“轮换发球法”进行比赛。后来，双方打到二十六比二十八，郑敏之才失利。郑敏之在○比一失利的情况下，仍然沉着应战，一板一板地削回山中强烈旋转的扣球，以顽强的战斗意志和革命精神连扳两局，取得最后胜利，赢得了全场观众的热烈掌声和赞扬。
    在男子团体赛中，由庄则栋、李富勇和周兰荪组成的中国队，也发挥了敢打敢拚的小老虎风格，以五比○战胜了由长谷川信彦、福岛万治和相川雄二组成的日本队。
    各国选手在四天的比赛中，表现了顽强的战斗精神，打出了很高的水平。日本男女队同中国男女队决战以前，曾分别以五比二和三比○战胜朝鲜男女队。
    各国参加比赛的许多小将，尽管有的还是初次登场，但是他们那种不畏强手，敢打敢拚的精神，显示出了各国乒乓球运动新生力量的迅速成长。
    团体赛结束后，举行了发奖仪式。当获得男女团体赛前三名的各国选手走上领奖台时，全场观众爆发出长久不息的掌声。第一次参加邀请赛的也门代表团团长阿·申达尼和巴勒斯坦代表团团长萨·舒拉法向获得女子团体赛前三名的中国队、日本队和朝鲜队颁发奖杯和奖章；锡兰代表团团长阿·维蒂亚林甘和尼泊尔代表团团长古·普·洛哈尼向获得男子团体赛前三名的中国队、日本队和朝鲜队颁发奖杯和奖章。最后，全场观众在乐队伴奏下，起立齐声高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。
    这次邀请赛的五个单项比赛将从九月一日开始进行。
