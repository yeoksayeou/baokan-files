The Party branch of a certain unit's Fourth Company in the People's Liberation Army mobilizes the masses to tighten the political focus at all times and in all places, preventing any phenomenon that deviates from the political line. In this company, the principle of emphasizing politics has been further implemented.

"To tighten the political focus in the company, one must first tighten one's own political focus; to make the soldiers listen to Chairman Mao's words, one must first listen to Chairman Mao's words oneself." The Fourth Company Party branch truly practices this. They lead by example in studying Chairman Mao's works and earnestly carrying out Chairman Mao's instructions. The political consciousness of the branch leaders drives the political consciousness of the party members and the masses.

"If there is no collective effort from the masses, even if the committee members have the ability to reach the heavens, they cannot hold the political focus." The Fourth Company Party branch trusts and relies on the masses. They do not view emphasizing politics as the responsibility of just a few committee members, but as the responsibility of all party members, youth league members, and the masses in the company. They earnestly implement the Party's democratic centralism. When there are differing opinions, they discuss them openly. They place the branch among the masses, willingly accepting the masses' supervision, and actively creating conditions for party members and the masses to offer suggestions and ideas to the branch. This company truly achieves the goal of everyone caring about and holding the political focus.

The Fourth Company Party branch has many good experiences and methods in mobilizing the masses to hold the political focus, which are not only of important reference value for the grassroots party organizations in the military, but also for factories, rural areas, shops, offices, and schools, and all other grassroots party organizations. —Editor

To quickly implement the emphasis on politics in the company, the company must, under any circumstances, firmly emphasize politics. The key is for the company's party branch to fully play the role of a fighting fortress and tighten the political focus. The party branch of a certain unit's Fourth Company in the Nanjing Military Region has fully played this role.

Unity of Thought, Coordination of Action

When Chairman Mao talks about the unity of the Party committee, he says: "If this 'group of people' do not act in unison, they cannot lead tens of thousands of people to fight or build." The Fourth Company Party branch deeply understands from Chairman Mao's teachings that: to tighten the political focus, the branch's "group of people" must act in unison and have a unified understanding, with everyone united in emphasizing politics and united in Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, the party branch, in tightening the political focus, first pays attention to continuously improving the branch cadres' and party members' understanding of emphasizing politics. When there are differing opinions, they put the issues on the table for full discussion. In the spring of the previous year, when the "Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road" came to the mountainous area for field training and paired up with the Fourth Company, the Fourth Company learned from the Good Eighth Company for over a year, significantly strengthening their ideological construction and becoming an advanced company in studying Chairman Mao's works throughout the unit; however, their military skills were not very solid. Therefore, some people commented: "The Fourth Company is good at studying Chairman Mao's works, but their military skills are average, lacking persuasiveness." Some leaders also said they had "weak spines." When this was heard by the Fourth Company, some branch cadres also felt that focusing too much on politics affected military matters and wanted to ease up. The Fourth Company Party branch believed that this issue, if not resolved, would shake the emphasis on politics. They convened a committee meeting and specifically discussed "What is persuasiveness?" and "How to have a strong spine?" During the meeting, some people listed the numerous living examples of the "Good Eighth Company" actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, remaining clean on Nanjing Road and enduring hardships in the mountains, making everyone realize that having just technical prowess does not mean having "persuasiveness." Only by mastering Mao Zedong Thought and emphasizing politics can one truly have persuasiveness and a strong spine. Emphasizing politics is the fundamental task of the branch leadership. Wavering or relaxing the leadership of emphasizing politics is equivalent to losing one's soul.

First Focus on Cadres, Firm the Direction

The Fourth Company Party branch understands from Chairman Mao's teachings that "After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor." They recognize that cadres and party members are the leaders in emphasizing politics. The Party's various policies and directives from higher levels must be implemented through them. If the political direction of cadres and party members is not clear, the unit may deviate. Therefore, they continuously strengthen the education and supervision of cadres and party members, making them adhere to the Four Firsts in all work and emphasize politics. In July of last year, just as the third round of shooting practice was about to begin, the eighth platoon's soldier Gu Ruiliang had not yet broken through his aim point. The deputy branch secretary (company commander) Shi Qingrong, who was leading the shooting practice, personally taught him to aim, but it was not very effective. He became impatient and ordered the eighth platoon leader Xu Zhengyi: "The entire company is just left with your platoon's 'fortress,' you must 'capture' it within one or two days!" As a result, the platoon leader was burdened with thoughts, and Gu Ruiliang also increased his burden. After the branch discovered this situation, they believed that Shi Qingrong's actions reflected his constant concern for the soldiers' skills, but not for the soldiers' thoughts. His eyes only saw the up and down of the gun's aim line, but not the up and down of the soldiers' thought aim line. If this continued, it would definitely lead to deviation. The branch secretary went to talk to Shi Qingrong individually and further helped him in the committee meeting, making him realize that: simply putting pressure on the soldiers' skills might bring up the skills, but it would push down their thoughts, and private thoughts for shooting would come out. If this continued, it would definitely lead the soldiers down the wrong path of emphasizing skills and neglecting political thoughts. After the meeting, he immediately corrected his mistake, first solving Gu Ruiliang's thought difficulties, helping him study Chairman Mao's works, eliminating private thoughts, and establishing the thought of shooting for the revolution; then helping him find the technical laws according to Chairman Mao's teachings, finally breaking through the technical difficulties.

The party branch also uses party life systems to further supervise cadres in emphasizing politics. They stipulate: the secretary and deputy secretary must first report their own situation of emphasizing politics in a month when reporting work to the branch meeting. The branch meeting also regularly evaluates and identifies the situation of cadres emphasizing politics. Each cadre reports their thought situation to the party small group leader, mainly reporting the situation of emphasizing politics. Through this series of systems, cadres and party members are always under the supervision of the party organization, receiving the enthusiastic help of the masses, and playing a model role in emphasizing politics.

Mobilize the Masses, Tighten the Focus Everywhere

The Fourth Company Party branch believes that emphasizing politics is a major matter for our Party and the class, not just a matter for a few people, and it must rely on party members and the masses, with everyone emphasizing and tightening the focus. The branch cadres often say: "If there is no collective effort from the masses, even if the committee members have the ability to reach the heavens, they cannot hold the political focus." Therefore, they follow Chairman Mao's instructions on mobilizing the masses, often educating party members and the masses to be the masters of emphasizing politics, and to help the branch tighten the focus with a sense of responsibility for the proletarian revolutionary cause and care for the company's construction.

To give party members and the masses the opportunity to offer suggestions and ideas to the branch, every time a party branch meeting is held, as long as the situation allows, a certain amount of time is left for soldiers and party members to give suggestions to cadre party members. Every time the company cadres report work or conduct phase summaries, initial and final evaluations of the Four Good ratings, they promote democracy, letting the soldiers speak their minds and offer suggestions. Because the masses are mobilized, with many people, many brains, and many eyes, everyone looks at and thinks about problems, everyone's sensitivity to the signs of deviating from politics increases. Many problems that cadres did not see, the soldiers saw. Last autumn, when the company went up the mountain to cut grass, each person was required to complete cutting two thousand pounds of grass and pile the cut grass by platoon to see whose pile was bigger. Platoon leader Shi Youcai believed that this would lead to bad results, and personal heroism would grow. This is not about enhancing the unit's combat effectiveness but weakening it. He immediately reported his thoughts to the branch. The branch studied Shi Youcai's opinion and immediately changed the method of setting quotas and comparing grass piles, reassigning tasks, and focusing on educating everyone to promote communist style.

Be the Vanguard of Self-Revolution

The Fourth Company Party branch believes that to tighten the company's political focus, one must first tighten one's own political focus; to make the soldiers listen to Chairman Mao's words, one must first listen to Chairman Mao's words oneself. They follow Chairman Mao's teachings on education, striving to be the leaders in fighting against individualism and the vanguard of self-revolution.

In recent years, the Fourth Company Party branch has always placed the organization of branch cadres studying Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all work, making the committee the core of studying Chairman Mao's works. Since this year, in addition to participating in the soldiers' "daily reading," the branch cadres also gather every evening to study Chairman Mao's works for half an hour. Every time a committee meeting is held to discuss issues, they first study a section of Chairman Mao's works; every time they check the implementation of branch resolutions, they first check the situation of studying Chairman Mao's works. The branch cadres, in studying Chairman Mao's works, all consciously "expose their thoughts" and "fight private thoughts." They deeply feel that: sometimes the lack of awareness and firmness in tightening the political focus is inseparable from private thoughts. If there are private thoughts of fearing criticism, fearing not being able to complete the task, and fearing to ruin the "Four Good" pot, one will loudly advocate emphasizing politics but secretly focus on completing the task. Therefore, when encountering the "fear" blocking the way in tightening the political focus, they consciously fight against private thoughts, thus achieving the firm emphasis on politics.

In April of this year, when the company was conducting the first round of shooting practice, several main cadres left due to other tasks, leaving only Deputy Company Commander Wei Benjiang (committee member) to lead the overall work. The Fourth Company's shooting skills were originally very poor, and this year there were over forty new soldiers, so what should be focused on first in this situation? Wei Benjiang hesitated for a moment, but he quickly realized that the fewer the cadres, the heavier the tasks, the weaker the foundation, the more one should focus on thoughts. Why am I now unable to make a decision? Upon reflection, he found that there was a hidden "fear" in his mind, thinking that other cadres were not there, and all the responsibilities were on him alone. If the shooting was not good, he would not be able to "account" for it! Discovering this private thought, he first overcame it. He thought: even if the technical problem is urgent, I must tightly grasp the thoughts. He found that some soldiers had not resolved the thought of practicing for the revolution, so he stopped the class to study Chairman Mao's works, establishing the thought of practicing one shot and one bullet for the people. Because the soldiers' thoughts were improved, the technical difficulties were quickly overcome, and the shooting results were very good. Wei Benjiang deeply felt: "Only with no private thoughts can one be fearless, and only with no fear can one truly hold the political focus." (Attached picture)

　　党支部怎样把紧突出政治关
　　张明仲　尤静明　费如林　李光仓
    解放军某部四连党支部，发动群众，处处把紧突出政治关，时时防止冲击政治的现象发生。在这个连队，突出政治的原则得到了进一步落实。
    “要把紧连队突出政治关，首先要把紧自己突出政治关；要叫战士听毛主席的话，首先自己要听毛主席的话。”四连党支部真正做到了这一点。他们带头读毛主席的书，认真地按照毛主席的指示办事，支部领导成员的思想革命化，带动了党员和群众的思想革命化。
    “如果没有群众的共同努力，支委会几个人纵有登天的本事，也把不住突出政治关。”四连党支部相信群众，依靠群众。他们不是把突出政治看作支委会少数几个人的事，而是看作全连党、团员和群众的事情。他们认真地执行了党的民主集中制，发生了分歧意见，就拿到桌面上来讨论。他们把支部置于群众之中，自觉地接受群众的监督，积极地创造条件，让党员和群众给支部出点子、提意见。这个连队真正做到了：人人都关心突出政治，人人都把住突出政治关。
    四连党支部发动群众把住突出政治关的许多好经验、好办法，不仅对部队的基层党组织，而且对工厂、农村、商店、机关、学校等一切基层党组织，都有重要的参考价值。　——编者
    突出政治要迅速在连队落实，连队要在任何情况下，都坚定不移地突出政治，关键是连队党支部充分发挥战斗堡垒作用，把紧突出政治的关口。南京部队某部四连党支部，就充分发挥了这一作用。
    思想一致　动作整齐
    毛主席在讲到党委的团结问题时说：“如果这‘一班人’动作不整齐，就休想带领千百万人去作战，去建设。”四连党支部从毛主席这一教导里深刻地认识到：支部要把紧突出政治关，首先支部这“一班人”要动作整齐，思想认识一致，人人齐心于突出政治，齐心于毛泽东思想。因此，党支部在把突出政治关中，首先注意不断提高支部骨干和党员对突出政治的认识。发生了分歧意见，他们就把问题摆到桌面上，充分讨论。前年春，“南京路上好八连”来到山区野营，和四连结成“一帮一”对子后，四连经过一年多时间学习好八连，思想建设有很大加强，成了全部队学习毛主席著作的先进连队；但是，军事技术却不大过硬。因此，有人议论说：“四连学习毛主席著作好，可军事技术一般化，缺乏说服力。”个别领导同志也说他们“腰杆不硬”。这话传到四连后，有的支部骨干也觉得政治抓多了，影响了军事，想松松手。四连党支部认为，这个问题不解决，对突出政治就会动摇。他们召开支委会，专门展开了“什么才是说服力？”“怎样才能腰杆硬？”的讨论。会上，有些人列举了“好八连”活学活用毛主席著作，在南京路上一尘不染，到山沟里不怕艰苦的大量活生生的事实，使大家认识到只是技术冒尖不算有“说服力”，只有掌握了毛泽东思想、突出了政治，才算有真正的说服力，也才能真正腰杆硬。突出政治是支部领导的根本任务，动摇、放松对突出政治的领导，就等于失去了灵魂。
    先抓干部　坚定方向
    四连党支部从毛主席教导的“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素”中认识到：干部党员是突出政治的领头人，党的各项方针政策，上级的各项指示，都要通过他们去贯彻执行，如果干部党员的政治方向不明确，部队就容易转向。因此，他们不断加强对干部党员的教育和监督，使他们在一切工作中都坚持四个第一，突出政治。去年七月，正当射击第三练习快接近打靶时，八班战士顾瑞良瞄准难点还没有突破。领导射击预习的支部副书记石庆荣同志（连长），把着手教他瞄准，还是不大见效。他心一急，就给八班长徐正义下命令说：“全连就剩下你们班这个‘堡垒’了，限你一两天内一定得‘攻’下来！”结果弄得八班长背上了思想包袱，顾瑞良也增加了负担。党支部发现这一情况后，认为石庆荣这些做法，反映了他心里时刻在为战士的技术着急，而没有为战士的思想担忧，眼里只看到枪的瞄准线上的左右高低，而没有看到战士思想瞄准线上的左右高低，这样下去，就一定要转向，支部不能不管。支部书记就去找石庆荣个别交谈，又在支委会上进一步帮助他，使他认识到：这样单纯给战士技术上加压力，技术也可能被压上来，但是思想却被压下去了，为打靶而打靶的私心杂念却要被压出来。这样发展下去，必然要把战士引向只突出技术、忽视政治思想的邪路上去。会后，他立即改正错误，首先从解决顾瑞良思想上的难点入手，帮助他学习毛主席著作，破除私心杂念，树立为革命而打靶的思想；然后帮助他按毛主席的教导摸技术规律，终于使他突破了技术难点。
    党支部还通过党内生活制度进一步监督干部突出政治。他们规定：正副书记每次向支部大会报告工作时，首先报告自己在一个月中突出政治的情况。支部大会还定期对干部突出政治的情况进行评比鉴定。每个干部向党小组长汇报思想情况时，主要汇报突出政治的情况。通过这一系列的制度，干部党员时刻被置于党组织的监督之下，受到群众的热情帮助，在突出政治中起了模范带头作用。
    发动群众　处处把关
    四连党支部认为，突出政治是我们党的大事，阶级的大事，不是少数人的事情，必须依靠党员和群众，人人来突出，人人来把关。支部骨干们常说：“如果没有群众的共同努力，支委会几个人纵有登天的本事，也把不住突出政治关。”因此，他们遵照毛主席关于发动群众的指示，经常教育党员和群众做突出政治的主人，要以对无产阶级革命事业负责的精神，帮助支部把关，关心连队建设。
    为了使党员和群众有给支部把关出点子、提意见的场合和机会，每次开党支部大会，只要情况允许，都要留出一定的时间，让战士党员给干部党员提意见。每次连队干部报告工作，或进行阶段总结、四好初评和总评，都发扬民主，让战士有话就说，有计就献。由于群众发动起来了，人多、脑子多、眼睛多，大家都来看问题、想问题，大家对冲击政治的苗头感觉就灵敏了。有许多问题，干部没有看到的，战士看到了。去年秋天，连队上山割草，要求每个人完成割两千斤草的任务，并把割的草分班放成堆，比谁的草堆大。班长施有才认为，这样做会造成恶果，个人英雄主义的私心要随着滋长起来。这不是提高了部队的战斗力，而是削弱了战斗力。他立即向支部谈了自己的想法。支部研究了施有才的意见，立即改变了分指标、比草堆的办法，重新布置了任务，着重对大家进行了发扬共产主义风格的教育。
    当自我革命的急先锋
    四连党支部认为，要把紧连队突出政治关，首先要把紧自己突出政治关；要叫战士听毛主席的话，首先自己要听毛主席的话。他们按照毛主席关于教育者要先受教育的教导，争做同个人主义作斗争的带头人，当自我革命的急先锋。
    近几年来，四连党支部一直把组织支部骨干学习毛主席著作放在各项工作的首位，使支委会成为学习毛主席著作的核心。今年以来，支部骨干除了坚持参加战士的“天天读”外，每天晚上还集中起来学习毛主席著作半小时。每次开支委会讨论问题，首先学习一段毛主席著作；每次检查执行支部决议，首先检查学习毛主席著作的情况。支部骨干在学习毛主席著作中，都能自觉地“亮思想”、“斗私心”。他们深刻地体会到：把突出政治关有时缺乏自觉性、坚定性，是和私心杂念分不开的。思想上有了怕受批评，怕交不了差，怕砸了四好“锅”的私心杂念，就会明喊突出政治，暗在完成任务上使劲。因此，他们在把突出政治关中，遇到“怕”字挡道时，就自觉地狠斗私心，因而达到了坚定不移地突出政治。
    今年四月，正当连队进行射击第一练习预习时，几个主要干部因其他任务离开了，只有副连长魏本江（支委）一人负责领导全盘工作。四连射击技术基础原来就很差，今年又有四十多个新战士入伍，在这种情况下，首先应该抓什么呢？魏本江同志有些犹豫不决，但是他很快就认识到，干部越少，任务越重，基础越差，越要抓思想，怎么现在却拿不定主意呢？仔细一想，原来自己脑子里隐藏着“怕”的思想，认为其他干部都不在，责任都在自己一个人身上，如果射击打不好，不好交“账”！发现这一私心，他就首先斗倒它。他想：技术问题再急需解决，我也要紧紧抓住思想。他发现有的战士为革命而练的思想没有解决，就停下课来学毛主席著作，树立练一枪打一弹都是为人民的思想。由于战士们思想提高，技术难关很快攻破了，射击成绩很好。魏本江深有体会地说：“无私才能无畏，无畏才能真正把住突出政治关。”（附图片）
    解放军处处突出政治，发挥党支部的战斗堡垒作用。红九连前党支部书记陈金元（中）在军事民主会上，勉励同志们继承并发扬井冈山传统，为中国革命、世界革命而练兵，永远当彻底革命派。
