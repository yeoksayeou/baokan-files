	The broad masses of commune members and state farm workers in Heilongjiang Province, one of the major spring wheat producing areas in China, are joyfully harvesting their spring wheat. Many communes and state farms have already completed their harvesting work.

	This year, Heilongjiang Province's spring wheat has grown exceptionally well. The total yield and yield per unit area in the regions that have already completed harvesting are generally higher than last year, marking a rare bumper harvest in history. People excitedly say that this is another victory achieved by emphasizing politics and actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

	This year, during the spring wheat sowing period in Heilongjiang Province, the weather was characterized by low temperatures and heavy rainfall. The broad masses of commune members and state farm workers studied Chairman Mao's articles such as "Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and "Give Up Illusions, Prepare for Struggle," overcame their fears, and actively organized efforts to dig ditches and drain water. They overcame the difficulties brought by the low temperatures and heavy rainfall, and sowed the wheat on time and in good quality. Subsequently, they adhered to the principle of quality first and strengthened the management of the wheat fields according to high standards. They effectively controlled weeds and pests, ensuring that the spring wheat grew better than in previous years despite unfavorable natural conditions.

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Lanzhou on the 22nd, the broad masses of herdsmen in the pastoral areas of Gansu Province have, since last winter, launched a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, actively engaged in grassland construction, overcome drought and other natural disasters, and achieved another bumper harvest in livestock production.

	According to incomplete statistics, the seven pastoral counties in Gansu Province have this year produced over 600,000 young livestock of various types. The survival rate of lambs in most pastoral counties is over 80%, and the survival rate of young large livestock is over 90%. The survival rate of adult livestock is also higher than in previous years.

	Last winter and this spring, the pastoral areas along the Hexi Corridor in Gansu experienced drought, and the usually cold and humid grasslands of Gannan also showed signs of drought. The herdsmen of various ethnic groups studied Chairman Mao's works seriously and used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to drive the struggle against disasters and protect livestock.

	To overcome natural disasters and achieve a bumper harvest in livestock production, the various levels of leadership in this province dispatched a large number of cadres to the pastoral areas to strengthen leadership. They also convened meetings of representatives of poor herdsmen, armed the herdsmen with Mao Zedong Thought, and focused on the preparation of fodder and feed, grassland arrangement, shed construction, and livestock disease prevention. They made adequate preparations in both thought and material to ensure the livestock's survival through the winter and spring, and the birth and rearing of young livestock.

    思想革命化  生产形势好
    黑龙江广大社员农场职工突出政治春小麦增产
    甘肃牧民战胜干旱等灾害又一次夺得牧业丰收
    新华社哈尔滨二十二日电　我国春小麦主要产区之一的黑龙江省广大人民公社社员和国营农场职工，喜笑颜开地收割春小麦，不少公社和农场已经结束收割工作。
    今年黑龙江省的春小麦长得好。已经收完的地区总产量和单位面积产量普遍高于去年，是历史上罕见的好收成。人们兴奋地说，这是突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作的又一胜利。
    今年，黑龙江省春小麦播种期间，遇到了低温多雨。广大社员和农场职工，学习了毛主席的《愚公移山》、《丢掉幻想，准备斗争》等文章，克服了畏难情绪，积极组织力量开沟排水，战胜了低温多雨带来的困难，按质按量地适时种上了小麦。之后，他们又本着好字当头、质量第一的精神，按高标准加强了麦田的管理工作，有效地战胜了杂草、虫害，使春小麦在自然条件不利的情况下，长得比往年好。
    据新华社兰州二十二日电　甘肃省牧区的广大牧民，去冬以来掀起活学活用毛主席著作高潮，积极开展草原建设，战胜了干旱等自然灾害，又一次夺得了牧业丰收。
    据不完全统计，甘肃省的七个牧业县今年共接产各类仔畜六十万多头（只）。多数牧业县的羔羊成活率在百分之八十以上，大牲畜仔畜成活率在百分之九十以上，成畜保活率也高于往年。
    去冬今春，甘肃河西走廊各牧区发生了干旱，一向高寒阴湿的甘南草原也出现了旱象。各族牧民认真学习毛主席著作，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想推动抗灾保畜斗争。
    为了战胜自然灾害，夺取牧业丰收，这个省的各级领导机关都派出大批干部，深入牧区，加强领导，并且召开了贫牧民代表大会，用毛泽东思想武装牧民的头脑，大抓饲草饲料贮备、草场安排、棚圈修建和牲畜防疫等工作，为牲畜越冬度春、接羔育羔作了充分的思想准备和物质准备。
