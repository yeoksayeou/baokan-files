In response to the great call of the most beloved leader Chairman Mao, over 8,000 young athletes from the capital crossed Kunming Lake in a grand procession to celebrate the "August 1" Army Day. Inspired by Chairman Mao's magnificent swim across the Yangtze River, they swam in the lake, shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life!" and "Victory to Vietnam, defeat to American imperialism!"

This was the first large-scale crossing of Kunming Lake in the capital.

Early in the morning, people flocked to the Summer Palace. Tens of thousands of spectators lined the shores of Kunming Lake. The wide lake surface and the shore were filled with red flags, Chairman Mao's quotations, and slogans. At the starting and ending points of the route, there were large banners reading, "Follow Chairman Mao's teachings and go to rivers, lakes, and seas for training!" and "Follow Chairman Mao into the waves!"

At 9:00 AM, two signal flares soared into the sky, and the crossing began amidst the sound of a grand bugle call. Immediately, shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!" and revolutionary songs filled the air. A powerful swimming formation quickly appeared on the route.

The honor guard, composed of students from the Beijing Institute of Physical Education, held high red flags and escorted a giant portrait of Chairman Mao at the front. Eight hundred soldiers from the People's Liberation Army, fully armed and in high spirits, swam at the forefront. Among them were many active learners of Chairman Mao's works, five-star soldiers, and outstanding pilots. Over five hundred workers from thirteen industries in the city participated in today's crossing. Each of them bravely swam the entire 600-meter course. Zhang Xiufang, a five-star worker from the honorable Longxing Machine Carriage Factory, and Li Cai, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, said excitedly after reaching the finish line, "Chairman Mao recently swam across the roaring Yangtze River again, which is a great inspiration to us workers."

Eighty Young Pioneers in the crossing sang "We Are the Successors of Communism" as they swam. The youngest among them was only eight years old. Although they were young, they listened to Chairman Mao's words and made rapid progress in swimming. Some Young Pioneers could already swim one or two kilometers.

Over 3,000 teachers and students from 23 institutions of higher learning, including Peking University, Renmin University of China, and Tsinghua University, which are deeply involved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, participated in the crossing with special excitement. Many of them shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" and sang "The Boat Needs a Helmsman" as they swam. The teachers and students expressed their determination to always follow Chairman Mao into the waves, to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of fearing neither heaven nor earth, and to resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

The Vietnamese swimming delegation, which is currently visiting China, also participated in the Kunming Lake crossing. When they reached the finish line, the spectators on the shore welcomed them with particularly enthusiastic applause. The athletes of the Vietnamese swimming delegation and the spectators together raised their arms and shouted, "Long live President Ho!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Victory to Vietnam, defeat to American imperialism!"

    响应毛主席伟大号召　欢庆“八一”建军节
    首都八千健儿横渡昆明湖
    据新华社三十一日讯　在最敬爱的领袖毛主席畅游长江的巨大鼓舞下，首都今天有八千多名游泳健儿浩浩荡荡地横渡昆明湖，庆祝“八一”建军节。他们在湖中一面奋勇前进，一面不断高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”同时高呼：“越南必胜，美帝必败！”
    这是首都第一次全市性大规模的横渡昆明湖活动。
    清晨，人们络绎不绝地涌向颐和园，数万名观众把昆明湖两岸围得水泄不通。宽阔的湖面上和湖岸边，到处红旗招展，到处是毛主席语录牌和标语。在航道的起点和终点，悬挂着“遵循毛主席的教导，到江河湖海去锻炼！”“跟着毛主席在大风大浪中前进！”的巨幅标语。
    九时整，两颗信号弹凌空而起，在雄壮的号声中横渡开始。顿时，“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”口号声和革命歌声响成一片。航道上迅速出现了强大的游泳队列。
    由北京体育学院学生组成的仪仗队，高举红旗，簇拥着巨幅毛主席画象，在前面开路。中国人民解放军陆海空军八百名健儿，全副武装，精神抖擞地游在前面。他们之中许多都是学习毛主席著作积极分子、五好战士、优秀飞行员。全市有十三个产业的五百多名职工，参加了今天的横渡活动。他们个个奋勇地游完了六百米全程。具有光荣革命传统的长辛店机车车辆厂的五好工人张秀芳和学习毛主席著作积极分子李才，在游到终点之后，兴奋地说：毛主席最近又一次乘风破浪畅游波涛滚滚的长江，这对我们工人是一个巨大的鼓舞。
    横渡大军中的八十名少先队员，在水中高唱《我们是共产主义接班人》的歌曲前进。他们中年龄最小的只有八岁。他们年纪虽然小，但是听毛主席的话，学习游泳进步很快。有些少先队员已经能游一、两千米。
    正在深入开展无产阶级文化大革命的北京大学、中国人民大学、清华大学等二十三所高等院校三千多名师生，今天以特别兴奋的心情参加了横渡。许多人一边横渡，一边高呼“毛主席万岁！”高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。师生们表示决心永远跟着毛主席在大风大浪中前进，发扬天不怕、地不怕的革命精神，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    正在我国进行友好访问的越南游泳代表队，今天也参加了横渡昆明湖活动。当他们到达终点时，岸上的观众以特别热烈的掌声欢迎他们。越南游泳代表队的运动员们和观众一起，振臂高呼“胡主席万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”“越南必胜，美帝必败！”
