Recent sharp rebuttals by Pakistani political observers and newspapers against the anti-China rhetoric of U.S. Ambassador to India Bowles have declared that Pakistan will continue to maintain friendly relations with China. This is a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists' anti-China conspiracy and a strong support from Pakistani friends to the Chinese people. We express our respect for the Pakistani friends' just stance of defying violence.

Bowles has been vigorously advocating that Pakistan should join Japan, Indonesia, and India to oppose China, attempting to drag Pakistan into an anti-China bloc. This is nothing but a pipe dream. Pakistani political observers have pointed out bluntly that this U.S. plot aims to instigate Asians to fight Asians, a clumsy old trick of U.S. imperialism. This has given Bowles a resounding slap.

The friendship between the Chinese and Pakistani peoples is one of shared hardships, and it has been tested. The U.S. imperialists' attempt to sow discord will only backfire.

On August 17, Bowles openly shouted anti-China slogans in New Delhi, revealing his true colors. He said that opposing China is mainly "the business of Asians," while the U.S. would "fill the vacuum" in Asia. In essence, opposing China is a pretext for U.S. aggression against Asian countries. Anyone who follows the U.S. in opposing China risks becoming a U.S. colony. The U.S. has been aggressively expanding its influence in India under the guise of opposing China, which is a living example. The people of Asia and all those with foresight will not fall for this U.S. imperialist trap.

Chairman Mao has pointed out that colonialists hope that the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who love freedom and independence will not unite, cooperate, and be friendly. He said, "We must respond with strengthened unity and friendly cooperation, and we must make the colonialists' plots completely fail." The Chinese people will follow Chairman Mao's teachings and continuously strengthen the friendship and unity between the Chinese people and the Pakistani people, as well as the people of other Asian countries, to smash the U.S. imperialists' aggressive plots.

    给挑拨者一记响亮的耳光
    本报评论员
    巴基斯坦政治观察家和报纸，最近尖锐地驳斥美国驻印度大使鲍尔斯的反华叫嚣，表示巴基斯坦同中国将继续保持友好关系。这是对美帝国主义的反华阴谋的沉重打击，是巴基斯坦朋友对中国人民的有力支持。我们谨向巴基斯坦朋友们这种不畏强暴的正义立场表示敬意。
    鲍尔斯竭力鼓吹巴基斯坦应当同日本、印度尼西亚、印度联合反对中国，想把巴基斯坦拉进反华集团。这完全是白日做梦。巴基斯坦政治观察家一针见血地指出，美国的这一阴谋是企图驱使亚洲人打亚洲人，是美帝国主义拙劣透顶的老把戏。这就给了鲍尔斯一记响亮的耳光。
    中巴人民是患难之交，两国人民的友谊是经过考验的。美帝国主义妄想从中进行挑拨，只能是自讨没趣。
    鲍尔斯十七日在新德里大肆叫嚣反华的时候，露出了他的狐狸尾巴。他说，反华主要是“亚洲人的事情”，而美国则要在亚洲“填补”亚洲国家的“真空地带”。拆穿来说，反华是美国侵略亚洲国家的一个幌子。谁要是跟着美国反华，谁就有沦为美国殖民地的危险。美国借口反华在印度拚命扩张侵略势力，不就是一个活生生的例子吗？亚洲人民和一切有远见的人们，是不会上美帝国主义这个当的。
    毛主席曾经指出，殖民主义者希望亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲爱好自由和独立的人民不团结，不合作，不友好。他说，“我们必须用加强团结、加强友好合作来回答它们，我们必须使殖民主义者的阴谋彻底破产。”中国人民将按照毛主席的教导，以不断加强中国和巴基斯坦以及亚洲各国人民的友好团结，来粉碎美帝国主义的侵略阴谋。
