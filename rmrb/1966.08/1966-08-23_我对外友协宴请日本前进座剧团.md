The Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries held a banquet this evening to warmly welcome the entire delegation of the Japanese Zenkokuza Theater Troupe, led by team leader Kawaharasaki Chōjūrō, who arrived in Beijing on the 21st.

Leaders from relevant departments, including Chairman Liao Chengzhi of the China-Japan Friendship Association and Chairman Chu Tu-nan of the China People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, attended the banquet. Chu Tu-nan stated in his speech that the combat unity and friendship established between the peoples of China and Japan in their joint struggle against American imperialism are an irresistible historical trend of our times. Our common enemy, American imperialism, cannot stop it, the Japanese reactionaries cannot stop it, and neither can the modern revisionism of the Soviet Union and its various old and new followers. The visit and performance of Zenkokuza in our country is a blow to these obstructers of Sino-Japanese friendship.

Chu Tu-nan said that the Chinese people have always followed the teachings of Chairman Mao, insisting on developing friendly relations between the peoples of China and Japan, and have made tremendous efforts to strengthen our unity and friendship.

Kawaharasaki, the team leader, said in his speech that the friendship between the 700 million people of China and the 100 million people of Japan is unbreakable by any force. We are willing to make every effort through this visit and performance to contribute to the further development of the combat friendship and unity between the peoples of Japan and China.

Liao Chengzhi addressed the banquet, saying that the visit of our friends from Zenkokuza to China is a great victory. This shows that as long as we unite, no matter how many obstacles our common enemies create for the peoples of China and Japan, we can overcome them.

    我对外友协宴请日本前进座剧团
    据新华社二十二日讯  中国人民对外文化友好协会今晚举行宴会，热烈欢迎由团长河原崎长十郎率领的日本前进座剧团全体成员。日本前进座剧团是二十一日到北京的。
    中日友好协会会长廖承志、对外友好协会会长楚图南等有关方面负责人出席了宴会。楚图南在讲话中说，中日两国人民在反对美帝国主义共同斗争中所建立起来的战斗团结和友谊，是我们时代不可阻挡的历史潮流。我们的共同敌人美帝国主义阻挡不了，日本反动派阻挡不了，苏联现代修正主义及其形形色色的新旧追随者也阻挡不了。这次前进座来我国访问演出，就是给这些对中日友好不高兴的阻挡者们当头一棒。
    楚图南说，中国人民一向遵循毛主席的教导，坚持发展中日人民友好关系，并为加强我们的团结和友谊作了巨大的努力。
    河原团长在讲话中说，七亿中国人民和一亿日本人民的友谊，是任何力量也割不断的。我们愿意尽最大的努力，通过这次访问演出，为进一步发展日中两国人民战斗的友谊和团结作出贡献。
    廖承志在宴会上致词说，这次前进座的朋友们能够访问中国，是个很大的胜利。这说明了只要团结起来，不管中日两国人民的共同敌人给我们造成多么大的障碍，我们都是可以冲破的。
