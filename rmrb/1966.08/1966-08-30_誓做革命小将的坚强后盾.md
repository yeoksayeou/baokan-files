	Pledge to Be the Steadfast Backbone of Revolutionary Youth
	National Labor Model Worker, Vice Chairman of the Anshan Steel Workers' Union Meng Tai

	From the capital to Anshan, revolutionary students across the country are using Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon to launch a fierce attack on the evil winds and bad habits of the bourgeoisie. They are sweeping away all the dust of old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes, and are establishing new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits of the proletariat. In short, they are firmly establishing Mao Zedong Thought. This is a thrilling and joyous event. We, the workers of Anshan Steel, give our most enthusiastic and resolute support to their revolutionary spirit and actions of rebellion. We loudly acclaim the revolutionary spirit of the Red Guards to rebel against the bourgeoisie—it is excellent!

	Chairman Mao says: "The thousand and one truths of Marxism boil down to one: 'Rebellion is justified.'" The revolutionary actions of the students to break with the old and establish the new are unstoppable by any stubborn old forces. The torrent of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is now sweeping through the strongholds of the bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie's nest is no longer safe. Various strange and bizarre fashions and yellow photographs and publications are now being severely condemned. We should not underestimate these issues. The door to the restoration of the bourgeoisie is precisely opened from these places. We must block the holes leading to capitalism and smash to pieces all the nests that breed revisionism. Anyone who opposes the revolutionary actions of the students is going against the teachings of our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, and against the decisions of the Party Central Committee. We, the workers of Anshan Steel, will not agree to this. We will definitely be the steadfast backbone of the revolutionary students, firmly stand on the side of the revolutionary students, and give our most enthusiastic and resolute support to the revolutionary actions of the students.

	We workers, peasants, and soldiers have boundless love, faith, and admiration for Chairman Mao. Mao Zedong Thought is the brightest red sun in our hearts, the lifeline of the revolution. Let us, together with the revolutionary students, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite closely, carry forward the spirit of proletarian revolutionary rebellion, smash the old world, build the new world, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, ensuring that our proletarian iron-clad state will never change color.

    誓做革命小将的坚强后盾
    全国劳动模范、鞍钢工会副主席　孟泰
    现在从首都到鞍山，广大革命学生正以毛泽东思想为武器，向资产阶级恶风陋习猛攻，正在横扫一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯灰尘，大立无产阶级的新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯。一句话，就是要大立毛泽东思想。这是一件振奋人心的大喜事。我们鞍钢工人最热烈、最坚决地支持他们的无产阶级的革命造反精神和革命行动，我们高声欢呼红卫兵无产阶级革命造反精神好得很！
    毛主席说：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’”革命学生破旧立新的革命行动是任何顽固的旧势力阻挡不了的。现在无产阶级文化大革命的洪流，正在冲击着资产阶级的各个阵地，资产阶级的温床保不住了，各种稀奇古怪的打扮和黄色照片书刊，正在受到严厉的谴责。我们不要小看这些问题。资产阶级复辟的大门，正是从这些地方打开的。我们一定要堵住钻向资本主义的孔道，把一切培育修正主义的温床砸得稀巴烂。谁要反对革命学生的革命行动，谁就是违背了最敬爱的领袖毛主席的教导，违背了党中央的决定，我们鞍钢工人坚决不答应。我们一定做革命学生的坚强后盾，坚决地站在革命学生一边，最热烈、最坚决地支持革命学生的革命行动。
    我们工农兵对毛主席无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，毛泽东思想是我们心中最红最红的太阳，是革命的命根子。让我们和革命学生一起，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧密团结起来，发扬无产阶级革命造反精神，砸碎旧世界，建设新世界，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，保证我们无产阶级的铁打江山永不变色。
