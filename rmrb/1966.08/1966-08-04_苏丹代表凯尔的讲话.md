Friends, Comrades:

Although I was unable to participate from the beginning of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers, I am still very happy to be able to participate in this grand closing rally held in Shanghai. Shanghai is famous for its revolutionary history in the proletarian revolution and socialist construction of the Chinese working class. Here, on behalf of the Sudanese delegation, I would like to extend my warm congratulations to you all for the great success of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers. We deeply appreciate the various conveniences provided by the Government of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people, and the Chinese Writers' Association, which have contributed to the success of this historic conference. At the same time, we sincerely welcome and unreservedly support all the resolutions passed by the Emergency Conference. We believe that these resolutions truly reflect the spirit of our revolutionary era, the legitimate aspirations of the people who are fighting against imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the United States, and the genuine wishes of these revolutionary peoples, that is, our pens should become powerful guns aimed at the hearts of our enemies, and also effective tools to push the revolution of the two continents forward and march bravely towards liberation.

Dear Friends, Comrades:

The more progress we make with our people in our revolutionary struggle against American imperialism and its lackeys, the more we adhere to our revolutionary principles, and the more clearly we see that the Soviet revisionist leaders and their followers in Sudan or elsewhere are merely a despicable mercenary group serving American imperialism. They openly or secretly collude with each other or individually cooperate with American imperialists and their lackeys to create divisions within the revolutionary ranks, lead the people away from the revolutionary path, and extinguish every revolutionary flame of struggle among them. If they have any achievements, we can only say that they have trained a small group of parrots who only repeat words that beautify American imperialism and advocate surrendering to the beasts that attack the people everywhere. Their recent illegal pseudo-conference held in Cairo, attempting to harm the Asian and African Writers' Movement from behind and split this movement, is only a further failed attempt to cover up their true nature, a futile attempt to salvage their notorious line in this regard, and to escape the spotlight of the majority of writers from the two continents. However, whether they follow this line near or far, to Cairo or Baku, to Tokyo or Havana, our searchlights will follow them, until they fall like bats that cannot stand the light at the feet of the revolutionary people. The Soviet revisionists, in order to continue down the path of splitism and deception, to create more favorable conditions for their closer cooperation with American imperialism, have put forward the false slogan of supporting the heroic Vietnamese people. But more and more people are realizing that the basic position of the Soviet revisionists is against armed struggle and people's liberation wars. How can the Soviet revisionists and their followers sincerely support the armed struggle for life and death that the heroic Vietnamese people have been waging for many years?

Friends, Comrades:

The Emergency Conference began and ended its work during an unprecedented period in the history of China and the world, a period when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong is underway in China. We are fully convinced that under the guidance of Mao Zedong's strategies and tactics, the Chinese proletariat can seize power and establish proletarian dictatorship, smash the old production relations, establish socialist production relations, and lead China onto the path of socialist construction. The Chinese proletariat will certainly be able to, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, completely smash the old ideology, firmly establish the Marxist-Leninist ideology of the working class, and grasp the ideological and cultural movement of this country. Mao Zedong Thought is the vivid embodiment and brilliant summary of the unprecedented arduous revolutionary struggles of the 700 million people over several decades. Therefore, Mao Zedong Thought is the most precious gift that the Chinese people have given to the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world. Every day in the struggle proves that Mao Zedong Thought is correct, invincible, and has the power to penetrate everything.

We, the Asian and African writers, wish the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the Chinese proletariat complete success; we wish the Chinese people greater and greater achievements in all aspects; we wish Comrade Mao Zedong good health and a long, happy life!

### 苏丹代表凯尔的讲话

    苏丹代表凯尔的讲话朋友们，同行们：
    尽管我没有能从一开始就参加亚非作家紧急会议，可是我仍然感到高兴，因为我能够参加在上海市举行的这次隆重的最后的群众大会。上海是以它的工人在中国的无产阶级革命和社会主义建设中的革命历史而著称的。在这里，我谨以苏丹代表团的名义向你们大家致以热烈的祝贺，祝贺亚非作家紧急会议所取得的巨大成功。我们深深地感谢中华人民共和国政府、中国人民和中国作家协会提供了各种便利，使这次历史性的会议取得了成功。同时我们衷心欢迎，并且无保留地支持紧急会议所通过的所有决议。我们认为这些决议真实地反映了我们革命时代的精神，反映了我们正在向以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义作斗争的人民的正当希望，反映了这些革命人民的真实愿望，那就是我们手中的笔应该成为向着我们人民的敌人的心脏开火的强有力的枪，同时也是把我们两大洲的革命永远推向前进，英勇地朝着解放进军的有效工具。
    亲爱的朋友们，同行们：
    我们同我们各国人民在我们反对美帝国主义及其走狗的革命斗争中取得的进展越大，我们就越坚持我们的革命原则，我们也越清楚地看到苏联修正主义领导人以及他们在苏丹或其它地方的追随者，都不过是为美帝国主义服务的一个不足道的雇佣集团。他们公开地或暗地里，勾结在一起或者个别地同美帝国主义者及其走狗合作，在革命的队伍中制造分裂，使人民离开革命的道路，并熄灭他们当中的每一个斗争的革命火焰。如果说他们有任何成就的话，那么我们只能说他们训练了一小撮学舌的鹦鹉，这些鹦鹉只会重复一些美化美帝国主义和鼓吹向在各处进攻人民的野兽屈膝投降的词句。他们最近在开罗召开一次非法的伪会议企图以此来从背后伤害亚非作家运动和分裂这个运动，这只不过是进一步掩盖他们丑恶面目的真正本质的一次失败的努力，不过是挽救他们在这方面的臭名昭彰的路线，逃避两大洲的大多数作家集中投在他们身上的光辉夺目的探照灯光的一种徒劳尝试而已。但是，不管他们带着这条路线走到近处还是远处，到开罗还是巴库，到东京还是哈瓦那，我们能够照穿他们的探照灯将跟着他们，直到他们象不能见光的蝙蝠一样跌落在革命人民的脚下。苏联修正主义者为了沿着分裂主义和欺骗的道路继续走下去，为了给他们同美帝国主义更紧密的合作制造比较有利的条件，他们提出了支持英雄的越南人民的虚伪口号。但是越来越多的人更清楚地了解到苏联修正主义者的基本立场是反对武装斗争和人民解放战争的，苏联修正主义者和他们的追随者支持英雄的越南人民多年来进行的武装的生死斗争怎么可能是真心诚意的呢？
    朋友们，同行们：
    紧急会议是在中国和世界历史上空前未有的一个时期在中国开始和结束它的工作的，这是一个在中国正在进行着由中国共产党和毛泽东同志领导的无产阶级文化大革命的时期。我们完全相信，由于中国的无产阶级在毛泽东的战略战术的指导下能够夺取政权和建立无产阶级专政，由于他们在毛泽东的指导下能够摧毁旧的生产关系，建立社会主义的生产关系并把中国引向社会主义建设的道路，中国的无产阶级也一定能够在毛泽东思想的指导下完全摧毁旧的思想意识，牢固地树立起工人阶级的马克思列宁主义的思想意识，并且掌握住这个国家思想和文化运动。毛泽东思想是七亿人民几十年来史无前例的艰苦革命斗争的实际经验的生动体现和光辉总结。因此，毛泽东思想是中国人民给予亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民和全世界人民的最珍贵的礼物。人民在斗争中的每一天都在提供证据，证明毛泽东思想是正确的、战无不胜的、是具有洞穿一切的威力的。
    我们亚非作家祝中国的无产阶级文化大革命完全成功；我们祝中国人民在各方面取得越来越大的成就；祝毛泽东同志身体健康，幸福长寿！
