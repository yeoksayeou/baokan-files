The Harbin City Dao Wai Commune Dongyuan Chemical Factory was originally organized by dozens of housewives. Since they were liberated from the confines of their homes, they have been actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, each of them full of vigor and with open hearts. They not only know how to work but also participate in martial arts training. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they resolutely criticized the bourgeoisie.

The news of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party spread, especially when they heard the joyous news that the great leader Chairman Mao had met with millions of revolutionary masses in the capital, they were all overjoyed and cheered enthusiastically. They were so happy that they forgot they were already mothers, each jumping and skipping like children. They couldn't find the right words to express their boundless love, admiration, and reverence for our great leader Chairman Mao, and could only repeatedly say, "Chairman Mao is heart-to-heart with us revolutionaries. We cannot be without you for a moment."

These former housewives have such deep class feelings for our beloved leader Chairman Mao! After reading Chairman Mao's books and hearing his words, they transformed from housewives who only knew how to cook, sew, take care of children, and serve their husbands at home into workers of the proletariat. After the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party in 1962, they responded to Chairman Mao's call, worked hard, and built a small chemical factory through self-reliance. At that time, it was so difficult; there were no factory buildings, so they built them themselves, and they learned technology from others in every possible way. Now, they have become workers who can build houses, conduct chemical analysis, and understand military affairs. Since the Cultural Revolution, they have written more than 600 big-character posters, criticizing the bourgeoisie. At the same time, they have used discarded materials to produce more than 20 important chemical products, supporting the country's socialist construction. They say, to make a revolution, there are countless ways, but the most fundamental one is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and honestly follow Chairman Mao's instructions.

Ma Lingyun, a mother of four children, is illiterate. Because of neurasthenia, her memory is poor. However, she remembers Chairman Mao's words the most and the clearest. She can recite many of Chairman Mao's quotations from memory. She is also the most active in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the factory. Her children also listen to Chairman Mao's words the most, copying Chairman Mao's quotations from the newspaper every day. Ma Lingyun said, I cannot bear to be without seeing Chairman Mao even for a moment. Therefore, I buy a new portrait of Chairman Mao every year to hang in my room and look at Chairman Mao from time to time. She said: When I heard the live broadcast of Chairman Mao meeting with millions of revolutionary masses in the capital, my heart beat with the broadcast's voice. I wish I could grow wings and fly to Beijing to stand in the parade and see my beloved Chairman Mao, whom I think of day and night. I also want Chairman Mao to see me, a former housewife, who has become a revolutionary pioneer and a builder of socialism under his guidance.

Jia Yufang, 38 years old, was moved to tears when she heard Chairman Mao's broadcast of meeting with millions of revolutionary masses in the capital. She recalled the old society where her parents died, and she led her three-year-old brother to work for the landlord, suffering endless hardships in the old society. It was Chairman Mao who saved her from the sea of suffering. And today, it is Chairman Mao who has cultivated her, a housewife who knew nothing, into a versatile builder of socialism. She had a thousand words to say to him, but she couldn't say a word. Jia Yufang said: Chairman Mao is heart-to-heart with us. He knows best what I want to say in my heart. Chairman Mao's words are all said to my heart. I will surely listen to Chairman Mao's words and turn every word into my action. This is the only way to repay him.

### 听了毛主席的话，家庭妇女变闯将

    听了毛主席的话，家庭妇女变闯将
    哈尔滨市道外公社东原化工厂，原先是由几十名家庭妇女组织起来的。自从她们从家庭的小天地里解放出来以后，活学活用毛主席著作，个个意气风发，心胸开朗。她们既会做工，还参加练武，无产阶级文化大革命中她们坚决批判资产阶级。
    党的八届十一中全会公报传来，特别是她们听到伟大的领袖毛主席在首都会见百万革命群众的喜讯时，个个欢欣鼓舞，热烈欢呼。她们高兴得忘记自己已经是孩子的妈妈了，个个像孩子一样蹦啊跳啊，她们找不出适当的语言来表达自己对我们伟大统帅毛主席的无限热爱、无限敬仰、无限崇拜的心情，只是一遍又一遍地说：“毛主席和我们革命群众心连心，我们一刻也离不开你。”
    这些过去的家庭妇女，对我们敬爱的领袖毛主席有着多么深厚的阶级感情啊！她们读了毛主席的书，听了毛主席的话，由过去只是在家里做饭、缝缝补补、哄哄孩子、侍候丈夫的家庭妇女，变成了工人阶级。一九六二年党的八届十中全会以后，她们响应了毛主席的号召，奋发图强，自力更生，办起了一座小化工厂。那时候多么困难啊，没有厂房就自己动手盖，不懂技术就千方百计地向别人学，现在她们已经成为又会盖房，又会化验，又懂军事的工人了。文化大革命以来，她们写了六百多张大字报，批判资产阶级。同时，她们还利用被别人扔掉的废料，生产出了二十多种重要的化工产品，支援国家的社会主义建设。她们说，干革命，千条万条，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，老老实实照毛主席指示办事，这是最根本的一条。
    四个孩子的妈妈马凌云，一个字也不识，因为神经衰弱，记忆力差，可是唯有毛主席的话，她记得最多，记得最清。她能脱口而出背诵好多条毛主席语录。而且用得最好，是这个厂活学活用毛主席著作的积极分子。她的孩子，也最听毛主席的话，天天从报纸上往下抄毛主席语录。马凌云说，我一时看不到毛主席也不行。因此，我每年都买一张新的毛主席像挂在房间里，不时地看着毛主席。她说：当我听到毛主席在首都会见百万革命群众的实况广播，心也随着广播的声音在跳，我恨不得一下子长上翅膀飞向北京，站在游行队伍中，亲眼看看我日夜想念的毛主席。也让毛主席看看我这个过去的家庭妇女，今天在他老人家的教导下，已经成了革命的闯将，社会主义的建设者了。
    三十八岁的贾玉芳，听了毛主席在首都会见百万革命群众的广播，悲喜交集，她回忆起旧社会死了父母，自己领着三岁的弟弟给地主干活，受尽了旧社会的折磨。是毛主席把自己从苦海中解救出来。而今天又是毛主席，把自己一个啥也不懂的家庭妇女，培养成为一个能文能武的社会主义建设者了。有千言万语要向他老人家诉说，可是她一句话也说不出来。贾玉芳说：毛主席和我们心连着心，他老人家最知道我心里要说的话。毛主席说的话，句句都说到我心坎上。我一定好好听毛主席的话，把每句话都变成我的行动，这才对得起他老人家。
