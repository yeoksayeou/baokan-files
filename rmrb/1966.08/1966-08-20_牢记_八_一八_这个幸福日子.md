Cherish the Happy Day of "August 18"

At 7:05 AM on August 18, 1966, this unforgettable and happy moment, our great leader and beloved teacher Chairman Mao received us. Chairman Mao shook hands with each of us. Our hearts were pounding! No words can express our feelings; we only knew how to repeatedly shout: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Chairman Mao is the greatest!"

At 11:20 AM, Chairman Mao took a group photo with us, revolutionary students from all over the country. This is Chairman Mao's greatest concern for us young people! This is Chairman Mao's greatest concern for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

The six of us come from families of poor peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary martyrs. Chairman Mao's reception gave us boundless strength, encouraging and urging us to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, to thoroughly smash the rule of the Lu Ping clique at the old Peking University, and to build a socialist new Peking University. Chairman Mao's reception inspires and urges us to study Mao Zedong Thought more diligently, to propagate Mao Zedong Thought more enthusiastically, to faithfully implement Mao Zedong Thought, and to resolutely defend Mao Zedong Thought! With Mao Zedong Thought, we dare to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire, bravely advancing through the storms and waves of class struggle!

This great day of "August 18," this happy day, will forever be etched in our hearts!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live, long live, and ten thousand years to our most beloved leader and teacher Chairman Mao!

　　牢记“八·一八”这个幸福日子
    一九六六年八月十八日上午七时零五分，这个终生难忘的幸福时刻，我们伟大的领袖、敬爱的导师毛主席接见了我们。毛主席一一和我们握手。我们的心都要跳出来了！任何语言都无法表达我们的心情，我们只知道不断地欢呼：“毛主席好！”“毛主席万岁！”
    十一时二十分，毛主席又同我们来自全国各地的革命师生在一起照像。这是毛主席对我们青年的最大关怀！这是毛主席对无产阶级文化大革命的最大关怀！
    我们六个人出身在贫下中农、革命干部、革命烈士的家庭。毛主席的接见，给了我们无穷的力量，鼓励和鞭策我们更加努力把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，彻底摧毁陆平黑帮统治的旧北大，建设社会主义新北大。毛主席的接见，鼓舞和鞭策我们更加努力学习毛泽东思想，更加热情宣传毛泽东思想，更加忠实执行毛泽东思想，更加坚决捍卫毛泽东思想！有了毛泽东思想，我们就刀山敢上，火海敢闯，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中勇敢前进！
    “八·一八”这个伟大的日子，幸福的日子，将永远铭记在我们的心上！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们最敬爱的领袖和导师毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
