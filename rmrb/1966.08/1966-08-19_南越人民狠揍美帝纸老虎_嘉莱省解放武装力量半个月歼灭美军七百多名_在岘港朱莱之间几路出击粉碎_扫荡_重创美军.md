South Vietnamese People Viciously Beat the U.S. Imperialist Paper Tiger

In the province of Gia Lai, the liberation armed forces have annihilated over seven hundred U.S. aggressors in half a month.

In the area between Da Nang and Chu Lai, several assaults have shattered the "sweeping operations" and severely damaged the U.S. military.

According to the New China News Agency in Hanoi, the liberation armed forces in Gia Lai, South Vietnam, have responded to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's great battle call. From July 24 to August 8, they annihilated over seven hundred U.S. aggressors, including an entire U.S. company and three platoons. They also destroyed seven enemy vehicles and seized a large amount of weapons.

According to the New China News Agency on August 17, Saigon reports that under the brave strikes of the South Vietnamese liberation armed forces, the U.S. Marine Corps' "sweeping operation" in the area between Da Nang and Chu Lai in the Que Son Valley ended in failure on August 15.

According to Western news agencies, due to the continuous attacks by the South Vietnamese liberation armed forces, the U.S. and puppet forces' two invasion bases in Da Nang and Chu Lai were directly threatened. From August 6, the U.S. and puppet forces concentrated three U.S. Marine Corps battalions and six puppet Marine Corps battalions, totaling several thousand troops, to launch this "sweeping operation."

However, the South Vietnamese liberation armed forces had already prepared for battle and launched surprise attacks on the enemy from several directions, severely damaging one U.S. battalion and one puppet battalion.

After suffering heavy losses, the U.S. aggressors were forced to retreat from the Que Son Valley area on the night of August 15.

　　在岘港朱莱之间几路出击粉碎“扫荡”重创美军
    据新华社河内电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方嘉莱省解放武装力量，响应胡志明主席的伟大战斗号召，从七月二十四日到八月八日，共消灭美国侵略军七百多名，其中全歼美军一个连和三个排，击毁敌人军车七辆，缴获大批武器。
    据新华社十七日讯　西贡消息：在越南南方解放武装力量的英勇打击下，美国海军陆战队在岘港和朱莱之间桂山河谷发动的“扫荡”，十五日以失败而告终。
    据西方通讯社报道，由于越南南方解放武装力量不断发动袭击，使美军在岘港和朱莱的两个侵略基地受到“直接威胁”，美伪集团从六日开始集中了三个营的美国海军陆战队和六个营的南越伪海军陆战队共数千人发动了这次“扫荡”。
    但是，越南南方解放武装力量早已作好了战斗准备，分几路对敌军伺机猛袭，重创一营美军和一营伪军。
    美国侵略军在遭到重大损失后，不得不于十五日晚从桂山河谷地区撤退。
