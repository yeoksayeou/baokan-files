Chairman Mao's words strike a chord in our hearts. We, ten people from the Xizhuang Store Production Brigade of Wangzuo Commune in Fengtai District, Beijing, have been listening to Chairman Mao's voice in recent days: first it was the "Sixteen Points" on the Cultural Revolution, then Chairman Mao's meeting with revolutionary masses in the capital, instructing everyone to "care about state affairs and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end!" Now it is the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee. We love to hear Chairman Mao's words; every sentence resonates deeply with us, the poor and lower-middle peasants. We shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live for ten thousand years!"

The communiqué says that in the past four years, "people's communes have been further consolidated and developed. The country is full of revolutionary fervor, and a new situation of all-around leap forward is emerging." These words seem to be spoken directly to our production team. In the past four years, our team's harvests have been good, especially this year, when the total output may double compared to last year. This is mainly because the ideological outlook of the commune members has changed significantly, and everyone understands the reason for farming for the revolution. The commune members say, "Every extra pound of grain is an extra bullet, an extra bit of strength to annihilate American imperialism and the reactionaries."

The communiqué says we must "raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher." We, the poor and lower-middle peasants, fully agree with this. In revolution, the first and foremost thing is to follow Mao Zedong Thought. In production, the first and foremost thing is also to follow Mao Zedong Thought. Whatever is done according to Chairman Mao's instructions will succeed; whatever is not done according to Chairman Mao's instructions will fail.

Take our brigade's "Three Summers" this year, for example. The tasks are heavy, the workload is immense, and the time is tight. How should we handle it? If we followed the old methods, we would use material incentives and let work points take the lead. Now everyone understands that this is a dead end. To do well in production, we must emphasize politics and let Mao Zedong Thought take the lead. The Party branch organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's words on "self-reliance and arduous struggle." Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the young people voluntarily formed a shock team. The shock team members carried Chairman Mao's quotations, shouldered buckets of water, and sang revolutionary songs like "The Great Helmsman Guides the Ship" while planting sweet potatoes on the mountain. The mountain is high and the slope is steep, making it very tiring to carry buckets up the mountain. The young people wrote on the quotation board, "Resolve to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory," and placed it by the steepest and most dangerous path. Wow! This had a great effect. The young people, after seeing the quotation board, had even more enthusiasm, sang louder, and ran faster. Nineteen-year-old Sun Yuting said, "After seeing Chairman Mao's words, I don't know where the strength comes from; I'm not tired, and my legs don't ache." Seventeen-year-old Liu Jianming, while running with a bucket, shouted, "Chairman Mao said to 'overcome all difficulties,' are we afraid of such a small difficulty? Run!" In this way, they encouraged each other and quickly completed the task.

In our brigade, a wave of studying Chairman Mao's works has swept through. The poor and lower-middle peasants all carry Chairman Mao's quotation books with them, studying wherever they go. The more they study, the brighter their minds become, and the more enthusiastic they are.

Since the Cultural Revolution began, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's quotations: "All erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, all monsters and demons should be criticized, and they must not be allowed to spread freely." In a few nights, we wrote more than 200 big-character posters, attacking the revisionist line of the former Municipal Party Committee. With our boundless love for Chairman Mao and our deep hatred for anti-party elements, we put in a thousand times and a hundred times more effort into production, using actual actions to counter all monsters and demons.

We, the poor and lower-middle peasants, deeply feel that as long as we read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, we will fear no difficulties or dangers. We can climb mountains, cross fires, dare to tread paths where no one has gone before, and dare to scale peaks where no one has climbed before. We will act according to the spirit of the communiqué and Chairman Mao's instructions, taking agriculture as the main focus and learning military, political, and cultural knowledge alongside. We will be able to farm with hoes and plows, work with hammers, fight enemies with guns, and write articles with pens, turning our Xizhuang Store Brigade into a grand school of Mao Zedong Thought.

We will definitely raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought higher and higher, passing it down from generation to generation!

　　毛主席的话句句说在心坎上
　　北京丰台区王佐公社西庄店大队　张元昌　白顺成　魏全等十人
    这几天来，我们不断听到毛主席的声音：先是文化大革命的“十六条”，再是毛主席会见首都革命群众，教导大家“要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”现在又是八届十一中全会的公报。毛主席的话我们最爱听，句句都说在我们贫下中农的心坎上。我们高呼“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    公报里说，近四年来，“人民公社得到了进一步巩固和发展。全国到处是一片热气腾腾的革命景象，正在出现新的全面跃进的局面。”这话也好像是对我们生产队说的。四年来，我们这个队收成也都很好，特别是今年，总产量可能要比去年翻上一番。这主要是由于社员的思想面貌有了很大的变化，大家都明确为革命种田的道理。社员们说：“多打一斤粮食，就多一发子弹，就多一份消灭美帝国主义和反动派的力量。”
    公报里说要“更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗”。我们贫下中农一千个赞成，一万个赞成。干革命，千条万条，这是第一条。搞生产，千条万条，这也是第一条。啥事情按毛主席说的去办，准成；啥事情不按毛主席说的去办，准错。
    就拿我们队里今年的“三夏”来说吧！“三夏”任务重，活茬多，时间紧，咋办呢？要照从前的办法，就搞物质刺激，工分挂帅。现在大家都很明白，这条路是个死胡同。要想搞好生产，必须突出政治，毛泽东思想挂帅。党支部组织大家学习了毛主席关于“自力更生，艰苦奋斗”的语录。在毛泽东思想的指导下，青年们自动组成了突击队。突击队员们身带毛主席语录，肩挑着一担担的水桶，高唱着《大海航行靠舵手》等革命歌曲，挑水上山栽白薯。山高坡陡，挑着水桶爬山可真费劲。青年们就在语录牌上写了“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”十七个大字，插在坡最陡、路最险的道旁。嘿！这下作用可大了。青年们看了语录牌，干劲更大，歌声更高，跑得更快了。十九岁的女青年孙玉庭说：“看了毛主席的话，不知道哪来的劲，人也不累了，腿也不酸了。”十七岁的刘健明挑着水桶一面跑一面喊：“毛主席讲要‘排除万难’，这么点困难我们就怕了？跑！”就这样，你追我赶的，很快就完成了任务。
    在我们队里，已经掀起了一个学习毛主席著作的热潮。贫下中农都随身带着毛主席语录本，走到那里就学到那里，大家越学心越亮，越学劲越大。
    无产阶级文化大革命开展以来，广大贫下中农反复学习了毛主席的语录：“凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。”几个晚上我们就写了二百多张大字报，向前市委的修正主义路线开火。我们以对毛主席的无限热爱，对反党分子的无比仇恨，拿出千倍百倍的劲头来搞好生产，以实际行动来反击一切牛鬼蛇神。
    我们贫下中农深深体会到，只要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，就不怕任何艰难险阻，高山能上，火海能闯，敢于走前人没有走过的道路，敢于攀登前人没有攀登过的高峰。我们就是要按公报的精神，按毛主席的指示去做，以农为主，兼学军事、政治、文化，我们要拿起锄头、犁耙就能种田，拿起锤子就能做工，拿起枪杆子就能打敌人，拿起笔杆子就能写文章，把我们西庄店大队办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    我们一定要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，越举越高，代代相传！
