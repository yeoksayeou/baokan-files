Syrian President Condemns US Support for Israel
Syrian Foreign Minister Declares No Hope in UN to Stop Israeli Aggression
Arab Countries Strongly Condemn Israeli Armed Invasion of Syria

Our newspaper's compilation report: According to Xinhua News Agency, Syrian President Nureddin al-Atassi on the evening of the 25th at the opening ceremony of the 13th Damascus International Fair, condemned U.S. imperialism for providing financial, political, and military support to Israel.

He said, Israel has received a large amount of dollars from the United States and West Germany. The United States, under the pretext of "defense," has provided Israel with jet fighters, new tanks, missiles, and various other weapons. He asked, "Are these weapons for 'defense'?"

Al-Atassi also condemned the United States for training technical personnel and officers for Israel and using the United Nations, which it controls, to shield and encourage Israel.

According to a report by Damascus newspapers on the 17th, Syrian Vice President and Foreign Minister Ibrahim Makhous announced that Syria will no longer appeal to the United Nations and the Security Council regarding Israeli aggression and will no longer have any hope in them.

Ibrahim Makhous made these remarks in response to the new military provocation by Israel against Syria on the 15th. The Syrian army, in this self-defense action, destroyed several Israeli gunboats.

A spokesman for the Syrian Army said that Israel has repeatedly carried out military provocations against Syria. This is encouraged and supported by imperialism and protected by the United Nations Security Council.

Arab public opinion strongly condemns imperialism's support for Israel's new military invasion of Syria, believing that this is not only an invasion of Syria but also of all Arab countries.

The Cairo-based *Al-Ahram* newspaper published an editorial on the 16th stating: "Israel's attack is not only directed at Syria but also at all Arab countries. Therefore, the Arab people fully stand with Syria."

According to a broadcast by the Baghdad Radio, the Iraqi Defense Ministry spokesman announced on the 15th that the Iraqi army "will not hesitate to stand with Syria against Israeli aggression if requested."

Kuwait's Acting Prime Minister and Minister of Information, Salem Sabbah, condemned Israel's aggression, calling it a "premeditated action." He said that Kuwait supports Syria with all its strength.

    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：叙利亚国家元首努尔丁·阿塔西二十五日晚上在第十三届大马士革博览会开幕式上，谴责美帝国主义在财政、政治和军事上支持以色列。
    他说，以色列从美国和西德得到了大量的美元。美国甚至以“防御”为借口向以色列提供喷气式战斗机、新式坦克、导弹以及其他各种武器。他问道：难道这些武器都是用来“防御”的吗？
    阿塔西还谴责美国为以色列训练技术人员和军官，并通过它所控制的联合国包庇纵容以色列。
    据大马士革报纸十七日报道，叙利亚副总理兼外交部长易卜拉欣·马胡斯宣布，叙利亚从现在起决不向联合国和安全理事会控诉以色列的侵略，并决不再对它们抱希望。
    易卜拉欣·马胡斯是在评论叙利亚在十五日遭到以色列新的军事挑衅后说这番话的。叙利亚军队在这次自卫行动中击毁了好几艘以色列的炮艇。
    叙利亚陆军发言人说，以色列一再对叙利亚进行军事挑衅。这是得到帝国主义的鼓励和支持，并得到联合国安全理事会的保护的。
    阿拉伯国家舆论强烈谴责帝国主义支持以色列对叙利亚进行新的军事侵略，认为这不仅是对叙利亚，也是对所有阿拉伯国家的侵略。
    开罗《金字塔报》十六日发表社论说：“以色列攻击的矛头不仅指向叙利亚，而且也指向所有阿拉伯国家。因此，阿拉伯人民完全站在叙利亚一边。”
    据巴格达电台广播，伊拉克国防部发言人十五日宣布，伊拉克军队“如果接到请求，将毫不犹豫地同叙利亚一起反对以色列的侵略。”
    科威特代理首相兼新闻大臣萨利姆·萨巴赫谴责以色列的侵略，认为这是一个“蓄谋已久的行动”。他说，科威特以全部力量支持叙利亚。
