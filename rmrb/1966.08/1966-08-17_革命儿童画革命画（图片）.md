Editor's Note:

From this issue of the picture magazine, readers can see what is always on the minds of the next generation, what they care about.

They always remember to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, to be good children of Chairman Mao.

They care about the great proletarian cultural revolution, the thriving socialist construction of our motherland, the struggle against class enemies at home, the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world, and the development of morality, intelligence, and physical fitness.

This is our next generation! This is China's future! This is the hope of the world!

The American imperialists, reactionaries of all countries, and modern revisionists, aren't they dreaming day and night of China's "peaceful evolution"? Aren't they pinning their hopes on the third and fourth generations of China? Let them see these pictures. The children's answer is: "Down with American Imperialism!" This young generation, growing up under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, is the reliable successor to the cause of the Chinese proletarian revolution. To change the color of China in this generation is a pipe dream!

A small handful of anti-party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought bourgeois representatives at home aren't they also trying every means to contend with the proletariat for the next generation, attempting to realize the conspiracy of capitalist restoration? Let them also see these pictures. The children's answer is: "Defend Mao Zedong Thought Resolutely!" Our next generation is infinitely loyal and devout to the great Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, infinitely loves socialism. They use their brushes to shatter the enemy's every delusion!

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches young people to "improve every day." Our next generation, under the leadership of the Party, is arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, holding the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, and passing it down from generation to generation!

　　编后
    从这期画刊里，读者可以看到，在我们下一代幼小的心灵里，念念不忘的是什么？关怀的是什么？
    他们念念不忘的是读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好孩子。
    他们关怀的是轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，是蓬勃发展的祖国社会主义建设，是对国内的阶级敌人作斗争，是世界人民的革命斗争，是德、智、体几方面的发展。
    这就是我们的下一代！这就是中国的未来！这就是世界的希望！
    美帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义者，不是日夜梦想着中国“和平演变”吗？不是把这个希望寄托在中国的第三代、第四代身上吗？让他们来看看这些画吧。孩子们的回答是：“打倒美帝！”在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下成长起来的这年幼的一代，是中国无产阶级革命事业可靠的接班人。妄想在他们这一代改变中国的颜色，那是白日做梦！
    国内一小撮反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的资产阶级代表人物，不是也在千方百计同无产阶级争夺下一代，妄图实现资本主义复辟的阴谋吗？让他们也来看看这些画吧。孩子们的回答是：“坚决捍卫毛泽东思想！”我们的下一代，对伟大的党和伟大的领袖毛主席无限忠诚，无限信仰，对社会主义无限热爱。他们用画笔粉碎了阶级敌人的一切妄想！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导少年儿童要“天天向上”。我们的下一代，正在遵照毛主席的教导，在党的领导下，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗更高地举起，一代一代传下去！
