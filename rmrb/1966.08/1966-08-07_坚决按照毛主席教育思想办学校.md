Revolutionary teachers and students from capital universities visit the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University (Antidai) historical exhibition, further solidifying their revolutionary direction.

They resolutely implement Chairman Mao's educational thought in schools.

Everyone unanimously declared: We must definitely carry the ongoing Cultural Revolution to the end. Thoroughly overthrow the capitalist-roaders in power, criticize the reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, and thoroughly reform the old educational system. Let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high in the educational front of the proletariat.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on August 6, many revolutionary teachers and students from universities in the capital have, in recent days, visited the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University historical exhibition, attending a most vivid and profound class on Chairman Mao's educational thought. Many revolutionary teachers and students, after visiting, wrote in the guestbook with hearts full of excitement: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the spirit of Antidai!" "Declare war on the old world!" "Declare war on the old educational system!" "Resolutely carry the Cultural Revolution to the end!"

Broad revolutionary teachers and students pointed out that thirty years ago, our great leader Chairman Mao personally led the establishment of Antidai, this most advanced, most revolutionary, and most progressive school, pointing the way for proletarian revolutionary school education and opening up a broad path. This fact eloquently proves that Chairman Mao's educational thought is the greatest, most correct, and most brilliant. However, in the more than ten years since liberation, the educational sector has been dominated by a small clique of bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the Party and reactionary bourgeois academic "authorities." They have done everything possible to resist Chairman Mao's educational thought, implementing their reactionary educational thought and educational system, cultivating revisionist successors, and preparing for the restoration of capitalism. Now, we will no longer be slaves to the bourgeois educational system. We must definitely raise high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the excellent style of Antidai, inherit the glorious tradition of Antidai, become the masters of proletarian educational affairs, and become the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. Many revolutionary teachers and students expressed special excitement, saying that recently, our great leader Chairman Mao has called on the people of the entire country to turn every industry into a revolutionary school that is both industrial and agricultural, both cultural and military. Chairman Mao's wise directive has great historical significance. We resolutely take Antidai as an example and turn our schools into revolutionary schools like Antidai, schools of Mao Zedong Thought.

Revolutionary teachers and students from many universities such as Peking University, Renmin University of China, and Tsinghua University, after visiting the Antidai historical exhibition, compared Antidai's educational policies, content, principles, and methods of teaching, and listed a large number of facts to show that the old educational system must be thoroughly reformed. A group of revolutionary teachers and students from Peking University said after the visit that Antidai uses Chairman Mao's works as the basic textbooks, placing political and ideological education first, with all work aimed at transforming students' thoughts; in the past, under the rule of the anti-Party, anti-socialist gang of Lu Ping and Peng Peiyun, Peking University did everything possible to prevent students from studying Chairman Mao's works, relentlessly instilling bourgeois ideas of fame and fortune into students, causing many students to be unable to distinguish between enemies and ourselves in class struggle, and unable to distinguish between the five grains in production struggle. Antidai takes class struggle as the main course, combining education with productive labor, combining intellectuals with workers and peasants, and combining theory with practice; in the past, Peking University was seriously detached from the three great revolutionary movements, detached from workers and peasants, and detached from reality, with students rarely participating in labor, and the school just letting students bury their heads in books all day, aiming to cultivate bourgeois young masters and mistresses, spiritual aristocrats. They said, we want to be rebels and critics of the old world. In this Cultural Revolution, we are determined to take Antidai as an example, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of Antidai, smash all old educational systems, and turn the old Peking University, this most stubborn and reactionary bourgeois fortress, into a new Peking University in the style of Antidai.

Among the seven students from the International Politics Department of Renmin University of China who wrote to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao proposing reforms to the literary curriculum, five students visited the Antidai historical exhibition. They excitedly said, we wrote to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, precisely to demand the establishment of schools in the style of Antidai. The direction of Antidai is the direction of all schools in the country, and every school should learn the experience of Antidai. The predecessor of Renmin University of China is the Shaanbei Public School, and we must not lose the Party's revolutionary tradition of running schools. We firmly demand to go among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to go to the three great revolutionary movements, to turn the school into a revolutionary furnace in the style of Antidai, and to temper ourselves into revolutionary warriors in the style of Antidai.

Tsinghua University student Zhao Yulan said, Antidai advanced to the enemy's rear to run schools, students went to the front lines to fight, participated in the rectification movement, participated in production, and did mass work, thus truly tempering and cultivating revolutionary talents. We must definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, face the wind and rain, see the world, and temper and grow in the great storms and waves.

Peking University Physics Department student Zhang Shuangshui, Beijing Institute of Mining and Technology Geology Department student Sun Yuanyi, Hebei Beijing Normal University student Zhang Shuguang, and others all eagerly expressed that Chairman Mao pointed out that the school system should be shortened and education should be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools can no longer continue. This says what is in our hearts. We must definitely carry the ongoing Cultural Revolution to the end, thoroughly overthrow the capitalist-roaders in power, thoroughly criticize the reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, and thoroughly reform the old educational system, letting the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high in the educational front of the proletariat.

    首都高等学校革命师生参观抗大校史展览更加坚定革命方向
    坚决按照毛主席教育思想办学校
    大家一致表示：一定要把当前正在深入发展的这场无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。彻底斗倒走资本主义道路的当权派，批判反动的资产阶级学术“权威”，彻底改革旧的教育制度。让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，在无产阶级教育阵地上永远永远地高高飘扬。
    据新华社六日讯　首都高等学校许多革命师生，连日来参观了抗大校史展览，上了一堂最生动最深刻的毛主席教育思想的课。许多革命师生参观后，满怀激动的心情在留言簿上写下：“毛主席万岁！”“抗大精神万岁！”“向旧世界开战！”“向旧教育制度开战！”“坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”
    广大革命师生指出，三十年前，我们伟大的领袖毛主席就直接领导创办了抗大这所最新型、最革命、最进步的学校，为无产阶级革命的学校教育指明了方向，开辟了广阔的道路。这个事实，雄辩地说明了毛主席的教育思想是最伟大、最正确、最光辉的。可是，解放后十几年来，由于教育界被一小撮钻进党内的资产阶级代表人物和反动的资产阶级学术“权威”统治着，他们千方百计地对抗毛主席的教育思想，贯彻执行了他们的一套反动的教育思想和教育制度，培养修正主义接班人，为资本主义复辟作准备。现在，我们再也不做资产阶级教育制度的奴隶了，我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬抗大优良作风，继承抗大光荣传统，做无产阶级教育事业的主人，做无产阶级革命事业的接班人。许多革命师生特别兴奋地表示，最近，我们伟大领袖毛主席号召全国人民，把各行各业都办成亦工亦农、亦文亦武的革命化的大学校。毛主席这一英明的指示，具有伟大的历史意义。我们坚决以抗大为榜样，把我们的学校都办成象抗大那样革命化的大学校、毛泽东思想的大学校。
    北京大学、中国人民大学、清华大学等很多高等学校的革命师生，参观抗大校史展览后，对照抗大的办学方针、教育内容、教学原则和教学方法，列举了大量事实说明旧教育制度必须彻底改革。北京大学一批革命师生参观后说，抗大以毛主席著作为基本教材，把政治思想教育摆在首位，一切工作都是为了改造学生的思想；过去北大在陆平、彭珮云等反党反社会主义黑帮统治下，却千方百计反对学生学习毛主席著作，一股劲地向学生灌输成名成家的资产阶级思想，使许多学生在阶级斗争中敌我不分，在生产斗争中五谷不分。抗大以阶级斗争为主课，实行教育与生产劳动相结合，知识分子与工农相结合，理论与实际相结合；过去北大却严重地脱离三大革命运动，脱离工农，脱离实际，学生很少参加劳动，学校就是让学生整天埋头读书，要把学生培养成资产阶级的少爷小姐、精神贵族。他们说，我们要做旧世界的叛逆者和批判者。在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，我们决心以抗大为榜样，发扬抗大的革命精神，砸烂一切旧教育制度，把旧北大这个最顽固最反动的资产阶级堡垒变成抗大式的真正的社会主义新北大。
    曾经给党中央和毛主席写信提出改革文科学制革命倡议的中国人民大学国际政治系七位同学中，有五位同学参观了抗大校史展览。他们兴奋地说，我们写信给党中央和毛主席，就是要求办抗大式的学校。抗大的方向，是全国所有学校的方向，各个学校都应该把抗大的经验学到手。中国人民大学的前身是陕北公学，我们决不能把党的革命的办学传统丢掉。我们坚决要求到工农兵当中去，到三大革命运动中去，把学校办成抗大式的革命大熔炉，把自己锻炼成为抗大式的革命战士。
    清华大学学生赵玉兰说，抗大挺进到敌后办学，学生上前线打仗，参加整风运动，参加生产，又做群众工作，这样才能真正锻炼和造就革命人材。我们一定要按照毛主席的教导，经风雨，见世面，到大风大浪中去锻炼成长。
    北京大学物理系学生张双水、北京矿业学院地质系学生孙远玺、河北北京师范学院张树贵等，都以迫切的心情表示说，毛主席指出学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。说出了我们心里的话，我们一定要把当前正在深入发展的这场无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，彻底斗倒走资本主义道路的当权派；批透反动的资产阶级学术“权威”；彻底改革旧的教育制度，让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，在无产阶级教育阵地上永远永远地高高飘扬。（附图片）
