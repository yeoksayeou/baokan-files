Writers attending the Asian-African Writers Emergency Conference arrived in Shanghai today after concluding their visit to Hangzhou. They were greeted by thousands of people from various sectors of Shanghai.

The Shanghai Railway Station, adorned with festive decorations, looked particularly solemn and beautiful. Large banners hung on nearby buildings read: "Welcome to the friends attending the Asian-African Writers Emergency Conference!" and "Long live the unity of Asian-African writers!" The platform was decorated with a badge made of flowers by Shanghai workers, symbolizing the Asian-African Writers Emergency Conference.

As the special train carrying the Asian-African friends slowly pulled into the station, the welcoming crowd erupted in excitement. Drums beat, streamers flew, and cheers and slogans filled the air. A group of Young Pioneers rushed forward to present flowers to the Asian-African friends. Along the friendship corridor, young women scattered fragrant petals towards the foreign guests.
