The editorial board of the *Liberation Army Daily* notes: Chairman Mao's "Conversation with American Journalist Anna Louise Strong," published twenty years ago, is of great significance. Twenty years ago, when American imperialism, relying on its monopoly of the atomic bomb, was rampant, and the Kuomintang bandits, backed by the United States, were aggressively attacking our liberated areas, Chairman Mao issued this extremely important speech. With the great revolutionary spirit and heroic language of the proletariat, he proposed the brilliant conclusion that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. Chairman Mao's great thought greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people and crushed the arrogance of the enemy. It was like a beacon, illuminating the path for our people to achieve revolutionary victory and for the oppressed nations and peoples around the world to strive for liberation.

Chairman Mao's great thought is a scientific summary of the revolutionary struggles of our country and other peoples, a major development of Marxism-Leninism, a model of Marxist-Leninists' unlimited trust in the power of the masses, a fundamental strategic thought of the revolutionary people, and a powerful ideological weapon for the people of the world to oppose imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries. In the current era of the flourishing revolutionary movements of various countries, especially in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, this great thought shines even more brilliantly and is increasingly influencing the hearts of people worldwide, becoming a source of great strength to strike down American imperialism and its lackeys.

In the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, Chairman Mao's great thought is greatly inspiring the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle, daring to win, and daring to rebel among hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses. It enables them to break through all obstacles on the path forward, overthrow the capitalist-roaders in power and the bourgeois reactionary authorities, sweep away all ghosts and monsters, and the bourgeois ideology, and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Every cadre and soldier in our army must seriously study Chairman Mao's great work, gain a deeper understanding of the corrupt and reactionary nature of imperialism and all reactionaries, and better arm ourselves with Chairman Mao's great thought of daring to struggle, daring to win, and being good at struggling and winning. We must carry forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to overcome all enemies, maintain a high state of combat readiness at all times. If American imperialism and its accomplices dare to impose war on our people, we will, together with all the people of China and the world, break the backbone of the invaders and decisively, thoroughly, completely, and entirely annihilate them.

To help comrades study this work, we have compiled this guide for reference by comrades in the platoons.

Historical Background

"Conversation with American Journalist Anna Louise Strong" was published in August 1946. This is Chairman Mao's extremely important speech on the international and domestic situations at a time when the Chinese revolution and counter-revolutionary forces were on the verge of a decisive battle shortly after the end of World War II.

After World War II, the international and domestic situations underwent significant changes.

Internationally: The victory of the anti-fascist war opened up broader possibilities and more realistic paths for the liberation of the proletariat and oppressed nations worldwide. The democratic and national liberation movements of various countries entered a new stage of development, and new revolutionary storms emerged in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. After the war, American imperialism replaced the positions of the German, Italian, and Japanese fascists, attempting to establish an unprecedentedly vast empire. The strategic goal of the United States was to first seize the extremely vast intermediate zone between the United States and socialist countries, extinguish the revolutions of the oppressed peoples and nations, and then proceed to eliminate socialist countries, placing all peoples and countries, including its allies, under the slavery and control of American monopoly capital. American imperialism, relying on its monopoly of the atomic bomb, engaged in war blackmail everywhere, established military bases, vigorously promoted policies of aggression and war, plundered the wealth of various peoples, and intensified preparations for new wars. The reactionaries of various countries, in order to maintain their shaky rule, also eagerly colluded with American imperialism, using American imperialism's "strength" to intimidate the people, attempting to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the peoples of various countries with the help of American imperialism's power.

Domestically: After eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the revolutionary forces led by the Communist Party of China had greatly developed, and our Party enjoyed extremely high prestige among the people nationwide, occupying an absolute advantage politically. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, American imperialism replaced the position of Japanese imperialism, adopting a policy to turn China into an American colony. The Kuomintang reactionaries, led by Chiang Kai-shek, with the strong support of their American masters, launched a full-scale attack on the liberated areas in July 1946. The Kuomintang bandits believed that they had over four million reactionary troops and more than three hundred million people in a vast area, controlled all major cities and most of the railway transportation lines nationwide, received all the equipment of one million Japanese invaders, and especially obtained a large amount of weapons and economic aid from American imperialism, completing the preparations for the attack. They also believed that the People's Liberation Army was already very fatigued after eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and was far inferior in numbers and equipment to the Kuomintang army. The liberated areas had only over one hundred million people, and in most of these areas, reactionary feudal forces had not been eliminated, land reform was not universal and thorough, and the rear of the People's Liberation Army was not secure. Therefore, they believed that it would only take three to six months to defeat the People's Liberation Army. Based on this erroneous estimate, the Kuomintang bandits, disregarding the Chinese people's desire for peace, launched an unprecedented counter-revolutionary civil war.

In such an international and domestic situation, both in China and abroad, there were people who had pessimistic assessments of the situation. They overestimated the strength of imperialism and reactionaries and underestimated the strength of the people, were deceived by the enemy's outward strength but inner weakness, failed to see the essence that the enemy was about to perish and we were about to win, were afraid of American imperialism, were afraid of the outbreak of a new world war, dared not engage in a head-on struggle with American imperialism and its lackeys, and dared not resolutely use revolutionary war to oppose counter-revolutionary war. Therefore, how to recognize revolutionary forces and reactionary forces, whether to dare to struggle and dare to win in the face of seemingly powerful enemies, became the most crucial issue concerning the fate of the Chinese revolution and world revolution, and the fate of the Chinese people and the people of the world. It was at this critical moment that Chairman Mao issued this brilliant work, proposing the brilliant conclusion that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers.

Great Significance

Chairman Mao's "Conversation with American Journalist Anna Louise Strong" is a great, brilliant work of Marxism-Leninism. In this work, Chairman Mao, using thorough dialectical and historical materialism, profoundly analyzed the domestic and international situations at the time, exposed the corrupt nature of imperialism and all reactionaries, scientifically summarized the historical experiences of the revolutionary struggles of our country and other peoples, creatively developed Marxism-Leninism, and added new powerful weapons to the theoretical arsenal of Marxism-Leninism. This brilliant work is not only a precious treasure of the Chinese people but also a common precious treasure of the people of the world. It has extremely important and far-reaching strategic guiding significance for the Chinese revolution and world revolution.

Chairman Mao's brilliant conclusion that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers is an unbreakable objective truth, a fundamental strategic thought of the revolutionary people, and a powerful ideological weapon for the Chinese people and the people of the world to oppose imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries. This brilliant thought greatly boosted the morale of the people and crushed the arrogance of the enemy, greatly enhancing the determination and confidence of the broad revolutionary masses to defeat any powerful enemy.

Over the past twenty years, Chairman Mao's brilliant thought has not only illuminated the process of the Chinese revolution, providing the Chinese people with unparalleled inspiration and strength, ensuring the great victory of the Chinese people's revolutionary war; it has also been familiar to and mastered by the revolutionary people of the world, inspiring all oppressed nations and peoples to oppose imperialism and its lackeys, greatly promoting the development of the revolutionary cause of the people of the world. As Chairman Mao's brilliant thought is increasingly widely spread and mastered by more revolutionary people worldwide, it will further greatly change the spiritual outlook of the people of the world and transform into a tremendous material force. This force will, with the momentum of a landslide and the power of thunder, shatter the old world and thoroughly bury imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries.

The revolutionary people of the world, including those in Asia, Africa, and Latin America who have taken the path of armed struggle, all regard Chairman Mao's theory that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers as a beacon on the road to liberation, enthusiastically praising it, actively learning it, and using it to guide their revolutionary struggles. Imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership, and the reactionaries of various countries all extremely fear and extremely hate this theory, strenuously opposing and madly attacking it. This further fully proves that Chairman Mao's theory has tremendous revolutionary power and is a brilliant scientific truth.

Currently, the revolutionary people of the world are engaged in fierce struggles with American imperialism and its lackeys. American imperialism, in collusion with the Soviet revisionist leadership group, is crazily expanding the Vietnam War and increasingly directing its aggression towards China. In our country, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is being vigorously carried out, and our people, under the command of the great leader Chairman Mao, are launching a general offensive against bourgeois and all exploitative class ideologies. Under these circumstances, using Chairman Mao's brilliant thought that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers to further arm our minds, firmly establishing a thorough revolutionary spirit of fearing neither heaven nor earth, and engaging in head-on struggles with American imperialism, modern revisionism, and all ghosts and monsters at home and abroad, resolutely carrying the Chinese revolution and world revolution to the end, has even greater practical significance.

Main Points

In this work, Chairman Mao answered eight questions raised by the American journalist Anna Louise Strong. The main contents are:

1. On the domestic situation (answers to the first six questions). The U.S. government and Chiang Kai-shek have no intention of stopping the war. Chiang Kai-shek wants to massacre the Chinese people, and the people must defend themselves to survive. If circumstances force us to fight, we can fight to the end.

2. On the international situation (answer to the seventh question). The smoke screen of anti-Soviet war propaganda released by American imperialism is, on the one hand, a political preparation for such a war, and on the other hand, a cover for the many actual contradictions it faces. Its actual purpose is to oppress the American people and expand its aggressive power into the capitalist world. The American reactionaries want to provoke a war, first attacking the American people and subduing the intermediate zone countries. The American people and the peoples of all countries threatened by American aggression should unite to oppose the attacks of the American reactionaries and their lackeys in various countries. Only when this struggle is victorious can a third world war be avoided; otherwise, it cannot be avoided.

3. On the conclusion that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers (answer to the eighth question). All reactionaries are paper tigers. Although the reactionaries appear frightening, they actually have no significant power. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people. American imperialism and the Chinese reactionaries will eventually fail, and the Chinese people will eventually win. The reason is that the reactionaries represent reaction, while we represent progress.

The atomic bomb is a paper tiger used by the American reactionaries to scare people. It looks frightening but is actually not frightening. Of course, the atomic bomb is a weapon of mass slaughter, but the decisive factor in the outcome of a war is the people, not a few new weapons. The Chinese people rely only on rice and rifles, but history will prove that this rice and rifles are stronger than Chiang Kai-shek's planes and tanks.

Key Points to Understand

1. Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers

Chairman Mao said: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. Although the reactionaries appear frightening, they actually have no significant power. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people."

Chairman Mao's brilliant conclusion is based on the unlimited trust in the power of the masses. Chairman Mao said: "Only the people, and the people alone, are the creators of world history." The people are always the majority, the people are always the strong, and the people will always rebel. New forces will always defeat decaying forces, and the revolutionary forces of the people will always defeat the counter-revolutionary forces. Imperialism and all reactionaries are corrupt and reactionary, alienated from the people, and enemies of the people, inevitably facing the opposition of the people and being overthrown by the people. This is a universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and a universal law of class struggle.

The victorious advance of the people's revolutionary movements is the mainstream of the times, which no force can stop. Over the past twenty years, the historical process of China and the world has fully proven Chairman Mao's brilliant conclusion that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. The great victory of the Chinese people's revolution, the great victory of the Chinese and Korean people's resistance against American aggression, the great victories achieved in the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national liberation, and the great victories achieved in the revolutionary struggles of various countries, all eloquently prove that the power of the people is invincible, and American imperialism and all reactionaries have nothing to be afraid of and can be completely defeated.

Chairman Mao taught us: Just as all things in the world have duality, imperialism and all reactionaries also have duality. On one hand, they are real tigers, eating people, eating hundreds of thousands or even millions of people. However, in the increasingly fierce struggles between the revolutionary people and them, they ultimately turn into paper tigers, dead tigers, and tofu tigers. Therefore, from an essential, long-term, and strategic perspective, we must realistically regard imperialism and all reactionaries as paper tigers. From this point, we establish our strategic thinking. On the other hand, they are also living, iron, real tigers, and they will eat people. From this point, we establish our tactical and strategic thinking.

Chairman Mao tells us here that to fight against the enemy, we must despise all enemies strategically and take all enemies seriously tactically. That is, we must despise it as a whole, but we must take it seriously in each specific issue. To achieve strategic contempt for the enemy, we must have a firm determination and confidence to thoroughly defeat the enemy, must have the courage to overcome all difficulties and never yield, and must have the thorough revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win. To achieve tactical seriousness towards the enemy, we must adopt a cautious attitude in every part, in every specific issue, be good at the art of struggle, adopt appropriate forms of struggle, concentrate our strength to fight, and step by step defeat the enemy.

Regarding the seemingly powerful imperialism and its lackeys, whether to dare to engage in head-on struggles is the touchstone of whether it is true revolution or false revolution, whether it is Marxism-Leninism or revisionism. The modern revisionists centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership are trembling with fear in the face of imperialism, extremely hating and fiercely attacking Chairman Mao's brilliant conclusion that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers, creating a psychology of fear towards imperialism among the masses, promoting a thorough line of capitulationism, opposing and sabotaging the people's revolutionary struggles, and completely degenerating into the number one accomplice of American imperialism and a shameful traitor to the proletariat.

Imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries are all paper tigers. A small handful of anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought bourgeois representatives in our country are also paper tigers, although they disguise themselves cleverly, play various tricks, obstruct and suppress the revolutionary movements of the masses, but in the face of the surging revolutionary tide of the masses, all their counter-revolutionary fortresses will be smashed, and they will be surrounded by the vast masses.

The Chinese people, armed with the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought, are the most revolutionary, the bravest, and fearless. We will thoroughly defeat the counter-revolutionary revisionists, the bourgeois rightists, and the bourgeois reactionary authorities, making them lose all their prestige and never be able to rise again. We will firmly and unshakably stand with the people of the world, resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and entirely annihilate American imperialism and all reactionary forces.

2. The decisive factor in the outcome of a war is the people, not a few new weapons

Chairman Mao said: "The atomic bomb is a paper tiger used by the American reactionaries to scare people. It looks frightening but is actually not frightening. Of course, the atomic bomb is a weapon of mass slaughter, but the decisive factor in the outcome of a war is the people, not a few new weapons."

Chairman Mao's brilliant scientific conclusion thoroughly shattered the myth of the atomic bomb propagated by American imperialism and armed the revolutionary people of the world.

American imperialism waves the atomic bomb to scare people everywhere. In fact, the atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs in the hands of imperialism cannot scare those who do not want to be slaves. Chairman Mao pointed out long ago: "Without the struggle of the people, the atomic bomb is empty." Although the atomic bomb has great destructive power, it cannot change the laws of war, cannot stop the revolutionary struggles of various countries, cannot determine the outcome of the war, and certainly cannot cause the destruction of mankind. The creators of weapons are people, and the users of weapons are also people. The development of history can only be the destruction of nuclear weapons by mankind, not the destruction of mankind by nuclear weapons. Imperialists and modern revisionists rely on nuclear weapons to carry out nuclear blackmail, which is not a sign of their strength but a sign of their weakness. Any class, any political force that opposes the masses and goes against the historical trend, no matter how powerful their new weapons are, are only paper tigers with external strength but internal weakness. Now, the monopoly of nuclear weapons has long been broken, and if American imperialism uses nuclear weapons to threaten other countries, it will also put its own country under the threat of nuclear weapons. If American imperialism dares to use nuclear weapons, it will inevitably put itself in an even more isolated position, accelerating its own doom.

Chairman Mao taught us: "Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor. The decisive factor is people, not things." Nuclear weapons are ultimately just a weapon. They cannot replace conventional weapons, let alone replace ground troops to fight decisive battles. The final victory of a war does not depend on launching nuclear missiles from thousands of kilometers away but ultimately depends on close combat within 200 meters on the battlefield, and on soldiers using conventional weapons to engage in continuous ground battles, thoroughly annihilating the enemy's combat effectiveness. The more nuclear weapons are used, the more firepower develops, the more it relies on close combat and night battles to solve problems, the more it relies on people's bravery and self-sacrifice, and the more it relies on the role of the human factor.

To rely on the human factor is to highlight proletarian politics and give full play to the role of political and ideological factors. Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: "For our army, the best weapon is not the airplane, not the cannon, not the tank, not the atomic bomb. The best weapon is Mao Zedong Thought. The greatest combat effectiveness is the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, who are brave and fearless of death." The spiritual atomic bomb of the revolutionary people is much stronger and more useful than the material atomic bomb. Our army relies on Mao Zedong Thought to defeat all domestic and foreign enemies. Mao Zedong Thought is forever the source of invincible strength for our people and all revolutionary people, enabling them to be invincible and unconquerable.

Our country has mastered the atomic bomb, which is a major victory in enhancing our national defense and a major contribution of our people to the cause of world peace. Without the atomic bomb, we are not afraid of the atomic bomb; with the atomic bomb, we will not rely on the atomic bomb. We rely on people's war to defeat the enemy. It was like this in the past, it is like this now that we have the atomic bomb, and it will be like this in the future when we have more and more powerful weapons. It will always be like this.

Chairman Mao's thought on people's war is the most effective magic weapon to defeat American imperialism and its lackeys. The revolutionary people of the world, learning and mastering Chairman Mao's thought on people's war, relying on the stage of people's war, fully giving play to their revolutionary spirit, utilizing all their advantages and strengths, will surely stage even more magnificent and heroic performances, burning the wild cow of American imperialism, which roams everywhere, into ashes in the flames of people's war.

3. All the people of the world unite to defeat American imperialism and all its lackeys, and carry the world revolution to the end

In this work, Chairman Mao brilliantly analyzed the aggressive nature of American imperialism, pointing out its arrogant ambition to seize the intermediate zone, proceed to eliminate socialist countries, and dominate the world. Over the past twenty years, the development of the international situation has fully proven the correctness of Chairman Mao's brilliant conclusion. American imperialism runs rampant everywhere, putting itself in a position of enmity with all the peoples of the world. American imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of all the peoples of the world.

To unite all possible forces and isolate and strike American imperialism to the greatest extent, Chairman Mao issued a great call to establish the broadest international united front against American imperialism and its lackeys.

In this work, Chairman Mao said: "The American people and the peoples of all countries threatened by American aggression should unite to oppose the attacks of the American reactionaries and their lackeys in various countries."

In 1964, Chairman Mao, in his "Talk on Supporting the Just Patriotic Struggle of the Panamanian People Against American Imperialism," said: "The peoples of the socialist camp countries should unite, the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America should unite, the peoples of all continents of the world should unite, all peace-loving countries should unite, and all countries suffering from American aggression, control, interference, and bullying should unite, forming the broadest united front to oppose the aggressive and war policies of American imperialism, and defend world peace."

In the same year, Chairman Mao, in his "Statement Supporting the People of Congo (Leopoldville) in Opposing American Aggression," said: "All the peoples of the world unite to defeat the American aggressors and all their lackeys! All the peoples of the world should have courage, dare to fight, fear no difficulties, and advance bravely. Then, the whole world will surely belong to the people. All devils will be destroyed."

Chairman Mao's great call greatly inspired the common revolutionary will of the people of the world to unite against imperialism. Currently, the struggle of the people of the world against American imperialism is surging, especially the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, which are flourishing and becoming the most important force directly striking American imperialism. Although the development of the international situation inevitably involves various twists and turns, the overall trend of imperialism heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism heading towards global victory is unchangeable.

The international united front of the people of the world against American imperialism must not include the lackeys, accomplices, and co-conspirators of American imperialism. The Soviet revisionist leadership group, pursuing a policy of Soviet-American cooperation to dominate the world, engages in splitting, sabotaging, and subverting activities in the international communist movement and national liberation movement, and in the issue of the Vietnamese struggle against American aggression, executes a counter-revolutionary two-faced policy of fake support and real betrayal, actively serving American imperialism. They are certainly not included in this united front. To oppose imperialism, we must also oppose modern revisionism.

Under the current favorable domestic and international situation, every cadre and soldier in our People's Liberation Army must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, use Chairman Mao's great thought that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers, and the great thought of despising the enemy strategically and taking the enemy seriously tactically to arm our minds. We must carry forward the revolutionary spirit of our army, which is fearless, daring to fight, daring to struggle, and daring to overcome all enemies. We must actively participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and do a solid job of preparing for war. We must carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country to the end. We must closely unite with the people of the world, resolutely carry the struggle against imperialism led by the United States to the end, and resolutely carry the struggle against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership to the end, and strive for the complete victory of the world proletarian revolution.

    学习《和美国记者安娜·路易斯·斯特朗的谈话》
    《解放军报》编者按：毛主席的《和美国记者安娜·路易斯·斯特朗的谈话》，发表到现在已经二十年了。二十年前，当美帝国主义仗恃它对原子弹的垄断地位，猖獗一时，蒋介石匪帮在美国支持下，气势汹汹地向我解放区大举进攻的严重时刻，毛主席发表了这篇极为重要的谈话，以无产阶级伟大的革命英雄气魄和豪迈的语言，提出了关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断。毛主席这一伟大思想，大长了革命人民的志气，大灭了敌人的威风，它像光芒万丈的灯塔，照亮了我国人民争取革命胜利的道路，照亮了全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民争取解放的道路。
    毛主席的这一伟大思想，是我国和各国人民革命斗争经验的科学总结，是马克思列宁主义的重大发展，是马克思列宁主义者无限信任人民群众力量的杰出典范，是革命人民的根本战略思想，是全世界人民反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派的强大思想武器。毛主席的这一伟大思想，在当前各国人民革命运动，特别是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民革命运动蓬勃发展的新时代，更加放射出了灿烂的光辉，在全世界范围内日益深入人心，成为打击美帝国主义及其走狗的强大力量的源泉。
    在当前我国无产阶级文化大革命中，毛主席这一伟大思想，正在大大鼓舞着亿万革命群众的敢闯、敢干、敢革命、敢造反的无产阶级革命精神，使他们冲破前进道路上的一切阻力，打倒走资本主义道路的资产阶级当权派和资产阶级反动权威，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神和资产阶级的意识形态，取得无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。

    为了帮助同志们学好这篇著作，我们编写了这个辅导材料，供连队的同志们学习参考。
    历史背景
    《和美国记者安娜·路易斯·斯特朗的谈话》是一九四六年八月发表的。这是毛主席在第二次世界大战结束不久，中国革命力量和反革命力量开始进行决战的时刻，关于国际形势和国内形势的极为重要的谈话。这是一篇具有伟大历史意义的光辉文献。
    第二次世界大战结束后，国际形势和国内形势发生了重大变化。
    在国际上：反法西斯战争的胜利，给全世界无产阶级和被压迫民族的解放事业，开辟了更加广大的可能性和更加现实的道路，世界各国人民民主和民族解放运动进入了一个新的发展阶段，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲地区出现了新的革命风暴。战后，美帝国主义代替了德、意、日法西斯的地位，企图建立一个空前未有的大帝国。美国的战略目标是：首先夺取美国和社会主义国家之间的极其辽阔的中间地带，扑灭被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命，并且进而消灭社会主义国家，把全世界所有的人民和国家，包括美国的同盟国在内，都置于美国垄断资本的奴役和控制之下。美帝国主义利用它对原子弹的垄断地位，到处进行战争讹诈，到处建立军事基地，极力推行侵略政策和战争政策，掠夺各国人民的财富，加紧进行新的战争准备。世界各国反动派，为了维持其摇摇欲坠的统治，也竭力同美帝国主义勾结，拿美帝国主义的“强大”来吓唬人民，妄图借助于美帝国主义的力量扑灭各国人民的革命火焰。
    在国内：经过八年抗日战争，中国共产党领导的人民革命力量有了极大的发展，我们党在全国人民中享有极高的威望，在政治上占有绝对的优势。抗日战争胜利以后，美帝国主义代替了日本帝国主义的地位，采取了变中国为美国殖民地的政策。以蒋介石为代表的国民党反动派，在他的美国主子的大力支持下，于一九四六年七月向解放区发动了全面进攻。蒋介石匪帮认为，他们拥有四百多万反动军队和三亿以上人口的广大地区，控制了全国所有的大城市和绝大部分铁路交通线，接收了一百万侵华日军的全部装备，特别是获得了美帝国主义大量的武器装备和经济援助，已经完成了进攻的准备。他们又认为，中国人民解放军在八年抗日战争中，已经打得很疲倦，而且在数量上和装备上远不及国民党军队，解放区只有一亿多人口，其中大部分地区的反动封建势力还没有被肃清，土地改革还不普遍和不彻底，人民解放军的后方还不巩固。因此，他们认为只需三个月至六个月，就可以打败人民解放军。从这种错误的估计出发，蒋介石匪帮就不顾中国人民的和平愿望，发动了空前的反革命大内战。
    在这样的国际、国内形势下，无论在中国还是在外国，都有一些人对形势存在着悲观的估计。他们过高地估计帝国主义和反动派的力量，过低地估计人民的力量，被敌人外强中干的现象所迷惑，看不出敌人快要灭亡、自己快要胜利的实质，害怕美帝国主义，害怕爆发新的世界战争，不敢同美帝国主义及其走狗进行针锋相对的斗争，不敢坚决地用革命战争反对反革命战争。因此，怎样认识革命力量和反动力量，在貌似强大的敌人面前敢不敢斗争，敢不敢革命，敢不敢胜利，就成为关系到中国革命和世界革命，关系到中国人民和世界人民命运的最重大的问题。正是在这个关键的时刻，毛主席发表了这篇光辉的著作，提出了帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断。
    伟大意义
    毛主席的《和美国记者安娜·路易斯·斯特朗的谈话》，是一篇伟大的、天才的马克思列宁主义著作。毛主席在这一著作中，运用彻底的辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义，精辟地分析了当时的国内外形势，深刻地揭露了帝国主义和一切反动派的腐朽本质，科学地总结了我国和各国人民革命斗争的历史经验，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，给马克思列宁主义的理论武库增添了新的强大的武器。这篇光辉著作，不仅是中国人民的宝贵财富，也是世界人民的共同的宝贵财富。它对于中国革命和世界革命，都具有极其重大、极其深远的战略指导意义。
    毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断，是颠扑不破的客观真理，是革命人民的根本战略思想，是中国人民和全世界人民反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派的强大的思想武器。这一光辉思想，大长了人民的志气，大灭了敌人的威风，使广大革命群众极大地增强了战胜任何强大敌人的决心和信心。
    二十年来，毛主席的这个光辉思想，不仅照亮了中国革命的进程，给了中国人民以无可比拟的鼓舞和力量，保证了中国人民革命战争的伟大胜利；而且为世界上的广大革命人民所熟悉、所掌握，鼓舞了一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争，大大地推动了世界人民革命事业的发展。随着毛主席这个光辉思想在全世界越来越广泛的传播，为越来越多的革命人民所掌握、所运用，必将进一步大大改变世界人民的精神面貌，并转化为巨大的物质力量。这种力量必将以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，打碎旧世界，彻底埋葬帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派。
    全世界革命人民，走上武装斗争道路的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的革命人民，都把毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的理论，看作是争取解放道路上的灯塔，热情地颂扬它，积极地学习它，用它来指导自己的革命斗争。以美国为首的帝国主义，以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义以及各国反动派，都极端害怕、极端仇恨这一理论，竭力反对和疯狂攻击这一理论。这就更加充分地证明了毛主席的这一理论，具有强大的革命威力，是光辉的科学真理。
    目前，全世界革命人民正在同美帝国主义及其走狗进行激烈的大搏斗。美帝国主义在它的头号帮凶苏联修正主义领导集团配合下，正在疯狂地扩大侵越战争，并把它的侵略矛头，越来越明显地针对着中国。在我国，正在轰轰烈烈地开展无产阶级文化大革命，我国人民正在伟大统帅毛主席的指挥下，向资产阶级和一切剥削阶级思想发动总攻击。在这种情况下，用毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的光辉思想，进一步武装我们的头脑，牢固地树立天不怕、地不怕的彻底革命精神，同美帝国主义、现代修正主义和国内外一切牛鬼蛇神进行针锋相对的斗争，坚决把我国革命和世界革命进行到底，就更加具有伟大的现实意义。
    段落大意
    毛主席在这篇著作中，回答了美国记者安娜·路易斯·斯特朗提出的八个问题。主要内容是：
    一、关于国内形势问题（对前六问的答复）。美国政府和蒋介石没有停止战争的愿望。蒋介石要屠杀中国人民，人民要生存就必须自卫。如果形势迫使我们不得不打的话，我们是能够一直打到底的。
    二、关于国际形势问题（对第七问的答复）。美帝国主义所施放的反苏战争宣传的烟幕，一方面是对于这种战争的政治准备，另一方面是用以掩盖它所直接面对着的许多实际矛盾。它的实际目的，是压迫美国人民和向资本主义世界扩张它的侵略势力。美国反动派要掀动战争，首先必须进攻美国人民，压服中间地带的国家。美国人民和一切受到美国侵略威胁的国家的人民，应当团结起来，反对美国反动派及其在各国的走狗的进攻。只有这个斗争胜利了，第三次世界大战才可以避免，否则是不能避免的。
    三、关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的论断（对第八问的答复）。一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。美帝国主义和中国反动派总有一天要失败，中国人民总有一天要胜利。这原因不是别的，就在于反动派代表反动，而我们代表进步。
    原子弹是美国反动派用来吓人的一只纸老虎。决定战争胜败的是人民，而不是一两件新式武器。中国人民所依靠的不过是小米加步枪，但是历史最后将证明，这小米加步枪比蒋介石的飞机加坦克还要强些。
    要着重领会的问题
    一、帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎
    毛主席说：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”
    毛主席这个英明论断，是建立在无限信任人民群众力量的基础上的。毛主席说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”人民永远是多数，人民永远是强者，人民总是要革命的。新生力量总是要战胜腐朽力量，人民革命的力量总是要战胜反革命的力量。帝国主义和一切反动派腐朽反动，脱离人民，与人民为敌，必然遭到人民反对，被人民所推翻。这是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，是阶级斗争的普遍规律。
      人民革命运动的胜利前进，是时代的主流，是任何力量都阻挡不了的。二十年来，中国和世界的历史进程，完全证明了毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断。中国人民革命的伟大胜利，中朝人民抗美战争的伟大胜利，越南人民抗美救国斗争所取得的伟大胜利，以及各国人民革命斗争的伟大胜利，雄辩地证明了人民的力量是无敌的，美帝国主义和一切反动派是没有什么了不起的，是完全可以打败的。
      毛主席教导我们：同世界上一切事物无不具有两重性一样，帝国主义和一切反动派也有两重性，它们是真老虎又是纸老虎。一面，真老虎，吃人，成百万人成千万人地吃。但是在革命人民同他们进行越来越厉害的斗争中，它们终究转化成了纸老虎，死老虎，豆腐老虎。所以，从本质上看，从长期上看，从战略上看，必须如实地把帝国主义和一切反动派都看成是纸老虎。从这点上，建立我们的战略思想。另一方面，它们又是活的铁的真的老虎，它们会吃人的。从这点上，建立我们的策略思想和战术思想。
      毛主席在这里告诉我们，为了同敌人作斗争，我们必须在战略上藐视一切敌人，在战术上重视一切敌人。也就是说，在整体上我们一定要藐视它，在一个一个的具体问题上我们一定要重视它。要做到在战略
  上藐视敌人，就必须有彻底战胜敌人的坚强的决心和信心，必须有排除万难、百折不挠的极大的勇气，必须有敢于斗争、敢于胜利的彻底革命精神。要做到在战术上重视敌人，就必须在每一个局部上，在每一个具体问题上，采取谨慎态度，讲究斗争艺术，采取适当的斗争形式，集中全力作战，一步一步地去战胜敌人。
      对于貌似强大的帝国主义及其走狗，敢不敢进行针锋相对的斗争，这是真革命还是假革命，是马克思列宁主义还是修正主义的试金石。以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义者，在帝国主义面前害怕得发抖，他们极端仇恨和大肆攻击毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断，在人民群众中制造对帝国主义的恐惧心理，推行彻头彻尾的投降主义路线，反对和破坏人民的革命斗争，完全堕落为美帝国主义的头号帮凶和无产阶级的可耻叛徒。
      帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派都是纸老虎。我国的一小撮反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的资产阶级代表人物也是纸老虎，尽管他们伪装得巧妙，耍弄各种阴谋，阻碍和镇压群众的革命运动，但是，在革命群众轰轰烈烈的革命浪潮下，他们的一切反革命堡垒必将被冲垮，陷入广大群众的重重包围之中。
      用伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的我国人民，是最革命的、最勇敢的，是无所畏惧的。我们要把反革命修正主义分子，把资产阶级右派分子，把资产阶级反动权威，彻底打倒，打垮，使他们威风扫地，永世不得翻身。我们要坚定不移地和全世界人民一道，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地消灭美帝国主义和一切反动势力。
    二、决定战争胜败的是人民，而不是一两件新式武器
    毛主席说：“原子弹是美国反动派用来吓人的一只纸老虎，看样子可怕，实际上并不可怕。当然，原子弹是一种大规模屠杀的武器，但是决定战争胜败的是人民，而不是一两件新式武器。”毛主席这个英明的科学论断，彻底地粉碎了美帝国主义关于原子弹的神话，武装了全世界的革命人民。
    美帝国主义挥舞着原子弹，到处吓唬人。其实，帝国主义手里的原子弹、氢弹，是吓不倒一切不愿意做奴隶的人们的。毛主席早就指出：“只有原子弹而没有人民的斗争，原子弹是空的。”原子弹虽然具有很大的破坏力，但是它绝不能改变战争的规律，绝不能阻止各国人民的革命斗争，绝不能决定战争的胜负，更不能造成什么人类的毁灭。制造武器的是人，使用武器的也是人。历史的发展，只能是人类毁灭核武器，决不是核武器毁灭人类。帝国主义者和现代修正主义者依靠核武器，实行核讹诈，这并不是它们强大的表现，而只是它们脆弱的表现。任何阶级、任何政治力量，凡是反对人民群众，违背历史潮流的，不管他们拥有多么厉害的新式武器，也都不过是外强中干的纸老虎。现在，核武器的垄断地位早已打破，美帝国主义要用核武器威胁别的国家，也就把它本国置于核武器的威胁之下。美帝国主义如果悍然使用核武器，就势必使它陷于更加孤立的地位，加速自己末日的到来。
    毛主席教导我们：“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。”核武器毕竟只是一种武器，它既不能代替常规武器，更不能代替地面部队进行决战。战争的最后胜利，并不决定于从几千公里以外发射火箭核武器，归根到底还是决定于战场上二百米以内的近距离搏斗，还是决定于使用常规武器的士兵经过连续的地面战斗，彻底消灭敌人的有生力量。越是使用核武器，火力越发展，就越是要靠近战、夜战解决问题，就越是要靠人的勇敢和牺牲精神，就越是要发挥人的因素的作用。
    发挥人的因素的作用，就是要突出无产阶级政治，发挥政治思想因素的作用。林彪同志指出：“对我们军队来说，最好的武器不是飞机，不是大炮，不是坦克，不是原子弹，最好的武器是毛泽东思想。最大的战斗力是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是勇敢，不怕死。”革命人民的精神的原子弹，要比物质的原子弹强大得多，有用得多。我们的军队就是靠毛泽东思想打败一切国内外敌人的。毛泽东思想永远是我国人民和一切革命人民战无不胜、攻无不克的力量源泉。
    我国掌握了原子弹，这是增进国防力量的重大胜利，是我国人民对保卫世界和平事业的重大贡献。没有原子弹，我们不怕原子弹；有了原子弹，我们决不依靠原子弹。我们依靠人民战争打败敌人。过去是这样，有了原子弹是这样，有了更多更厉害的武器还是这样，永远是这样。
    毛主席关于人民战争的思想，是战胜美帝国主义及其走狗的最有效的法宝。全世界革命人民，学会和掌握了毛主席的人民战争思想，凭借人民战争的舞台，充分发挥自己的革命精神，利用自己的一切长处和优势，必将演出更加威武雄壮的活剧来，把美帝国主义这只到处乱闯的野牛，在人民战争的烈火中烧成灰烬。
    三、全世界人民团结起来，打败美帝国主义及其一切走狗，把世界革命进行到底
    毛主席在这篇著作中精辟地分析了美帝国主义的侵略本性，指出了美帝国主义要夺取中间地带，进而消灭社会主义国家、称霸全世界的狂妄野心。二十年来，国际形势的发展，完全证明了毛主席这一英明论断的无比正确。美帝国主义到处横行霸道，把它自己放在同全世界人民为敌的地位。美帝国主义是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。
    为了团结一切可以团结的力量，最大限度地孤立和打击美帝国主义，毛主席发出了建立反对美帝国主义及其走狗的最广泛的国际统一战线的伟大号召。
    毛主席在这篇著作中说：“美国人民和一切受到美国侵略威胁的国家的人民，应当团结起来，反对美国反动派及其在各国的走狗的进攻。”
    一九六四年，毛主席在《支持巴拿马人民反美爱国正义斗争的谈话》中说：“社会主义阵营各国人民要联合起来，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民要联合起来，全世界各大洲的人民要联合起来，所有爱好和平的国家要联合起来，所有受到美国侵略、控制、干涉和欺负的国家要联合起来，结成最广泛的统一战线，反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，保卫世界和平。”
    同年，毛主席在《支持刚果（利）人民反对美国侵略的声明》中说：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
    毛主席的伟大号召，极大地鼓舞了全世界人民团结反帝的共同革命意志。目前，全世界人民反对美帝国主义的斗争正风起云涌，特别是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的革命斗争，正在蓬勃发展，成为当前直接打击美帝国主义的最重要的力量。尽管国际形势的发展不可避免地会出现各种曲折和反复，但是，帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的总趋势，是改变不了的。
    全世界人民反对美帝国主义的国际统一战线，绝不能包括美帝国主义的走狗、帮凶和同谋者。苏联修正主义领导集团奉行苏美合作主宰世界的政策，在国际共产主义运动和民族解放运动中，进行分裂、破坏和颠覆活动，在越南抗美斗争的问题上，执行假支持、真出卖的反革命两面政策，积极为美帝国主义效劳。他们当然不包括在这个统一战线之内。要反对帝国主义，就必须反对现代修正主义。
    在当前国内外的大好形势下，我们人民解放军每一个干部战士，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，用毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的伟大思想，关于在战略上藐视敌人、在战术上重视敌人的伟大思想武装我们的头脑，发扬我军一往无前，敢打、敢拚、敢搏，敢于压倒一切敌人的革命英雄主义精神，积极参加无产阶级文化大革命，扎扎实实地做好战备工作。我们一定要把我国无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。我们一定要紧密地和全世界人民团结在一起，坚决把反对以美国为首的帝国主义的斗争进行到底，把反对以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义的斗争进行到底，为实现无产阶级世界革命的完全胜利而奋斗。
