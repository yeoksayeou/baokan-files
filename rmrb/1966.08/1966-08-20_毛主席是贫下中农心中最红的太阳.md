	Chairman Mao is the reddest sun in the hearts of poor and lower-middle peasants!

	“Chairman Mao has arrived!”
	“Chairman Mao has arrived!”
	“Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live for ten thousand years!”

	Standing in the outskirts of Beijing, far from Tiananmen Gate, the members of the People’s Commune could not see Chairman Mao’s benevolent face clearly. However, when they heard from the front that “Chairman Mao is on Tiananmen Gate,” they were all extremely excited and passed the message to each other: “Chairman Mao has arrived!” They kept shouting loudly, “Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live for ten thousand years!” How many pairs of eyes were looking at the great leader standing on Tiananmen Gate! How many sincere hearts of poor and lower-middle peasants were jumping with joy! Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! At this moment, how can we express our boundless trust, boundless love, boundless admiration, and boundless worship for you!

	Chairman Mao is the reddest sun in the hearts of poor and lower-middle peasants! They regard attending a meeting at Tiananmen Gate as the greatest honor. Because they always associate Tiananmen Gate with Chairman Mao. No wonder at 00:30 on the 18th, the members of Dongsheng and Yuanyuan Lake People’s Communes in Haidian District carried a giant portrait of Chairman Mao, holding the “Quotations from Chairman Mao” and flowers, beating drums and gongs, came to Tiananmen Square. The members of Shuangqiao People’s Commune in Chaoyang District just finished criticizing the bourgeoisie meeting and immediately rushed to Tiananmen. Their hearts were all filled with the most beautiful wish: to see Chairman Mao!

	Chairman of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Association and Deputy Secretary of the Party Branch of Cuigezhuang Brigade in Zhong-A Friendship People’s Commune, Jin Xianmou, came to Tiananmen Gate for the first time to attend a meeting. When he heard that Chairman Mao was meeting with everyone on Tiananmen Gate, he struggled to the front of the queue and was so excited that he could only say one sentence after a long time: “I want to be with Chairman Mao forever!”

	The young female Communist Party member, Zuo Xiuqin, from Zhong-A Friendship People’s Commune, had seen Chairman Mao three times. Now, she stood on her tiptoes, stretched her neck, and looked towards Tiananmen Gate. She really wanted to see Chairman Mao again! After attending the meeting, she felt full of strength and decided to learn from the unnamed revolutionary pioneers praised by Chairman Mao, to study the decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally presided over and formulated by Chairman Mao, and to become a revolutionary pioneer who breaks the “four olds” and establishes the “four news”!

	With flowers and drums, the entire Tiananmen Square was immersed in a sea of happiness and excitement. The Secretary of the Party Branch and Deputy Chairman of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Association of Kangying Brigade in Zhong-A Friendship People’s Commune, Lu Zhifa, recalled his father who starved to death in the old society, his four younger siblings who were sold, and the miserable situation of him and his mother fleeing to Hubei in their childhood… He could not help but shed tears of joy while looking at Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! It is you who made this beggar child, after liberation, become the master of the state and live a happy life. He expressed his determination to pass on Chairman Mao’s new battle cry of “Carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!” to every commune member and ensure its implementation.

　　毛主席是贫下中农心中最红的太阳
    “毛主席来了！”
    “毛主席来了！”
    “毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    站在离天安门城楼较远的北京郊区人民公社社员，虽然看不清楚毛主席慈祥的面孔，但是，当前面传来“毛主席在天安门城楼上”时，个个激动万分，相互传告：“毛主席来了！”不断高声欢呼“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”多少双眼睛，望着站立在天安门城楼上的伟大领袖；多少颗赤诚的贫下中农的心呀，在欢乐地跳动！毛主席呀毛主席！此时此刻，怎样表达我们贫下中农对您的无限信任、无限热爱、无限敬仰、无限崇拜的心情！
    毛主席是贫下中农心中最红最红的太阳！他们把到天安门开大会看成是最大的荣幸。因为他们总是把天安门——毛主席联系在一起。难怪在十八日零点三十分，海淀区的东升、玉渊潭人民公社的社员，便抬着毛主席的巨幅画像，拿着《毛主席语录》和鲜花，敲锣打鼓地来到了天安门广场。朝阳区双桥人民公社的社员，刚刚开完批判资产阶级的大会，便立刻赶来天安门。他们的心里都怀着一个最美好的愿望：看看毛主席！
    中阿友好人民公社崔各庄大队的贫协主席、党总支副书记金显谋，第一次来天安门开大会。当他听到毛主席在天安门城楼上同大家见面时，就使劲地挤到队伍前面，激动得好半天才说出一句话：“我要永远和毛主席在一起！”
    中阿友好人民公社的年轻的女共产党员左秀琴，曾经三次见到过毛主席。现在，她踮起脚，伸长脖子，朝天安门看去，她多么想再看看毛主席呀！参加大会以后，她觉得浑身充满了力量，决心向毛主席赞扬的那些不出名的革命小闯将学习，好好学习毛主席亲自主持制定的无产阶级文化大革命的决定，当一个破“四旧”、立“四新”的革命闯将！
    花山旗海，金鼓齐鸣，整个天安门广场沉浸在幸福、欢腾的大海洋中。中阿友好人民公社康营大队支部书记、贫协副主席卢志发，在这万众欢腾的时刻，却回想起在旧社会饿死的父亲，被卖的四个弟妹，想起了幼年与母亲逃荒到湖北的惨状……不禁热泪横流地望着毛主席，毛主席呀毛主席！是您使我这个讨饭娃，解放后成了国家的主人，过着幸福的生活。他表示要把毛主席发出的“把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”的新的战斗号召，传给每个社员，保证坚决执行。
