I am a re-educated youth who has returned to the countryside. In the mountains, plowing is a technical agricultural task. I don't know how to plow, and seeing that this task lacks people to do it, I was anxious. I studied this problem by reading Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "What is work? Work is struggle. ... We work and struggle to solve difficulties." Thus, I made up my mind to learn how to plow. Whenever I had free time, I would drive the oxen around in the fields. At this time, someone said coldly: "You little fellow, why bother to learn plowing? The team has plenty of work, and you're not short of eight work points a day!" I immediately replied: "This is about taking over from the old poor peasants, farming for the revolution, not about eight or nine work points. Are we working for work points?" I persisted in practicing for several days and finally mastered the technique of plowing.

In our team, those tasks that are both hard and dirty, we young people and poor and lower-middle peasants all rush to do. But when it comes to evaluating work points, no one wants to take even half a point more. This is because we all realize that we farm for the revolution, not for work points. People like Sun Yefang try to use the bourgeois ideology of "everything for money" to poison our youth, but we will not fall for their tricks.

    为工分种田，我不干
    安徽泾县中村公社社员　孙满藩
    我是一个回乡知识青年。在山区，耖田是一种技术性较强的农活。我不会耖田，眼看着这个活缺少人干，干着急。我带着这个问题，学习了毛主席著作。毛主席说：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。……我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。”于是，我下定决心要学会耖田，一有空就赶着牛在田里打转转。这时，有人冷言冷语地说：“你这个小子，何必要学耖田？队里的活多得很，还怕一天少了八个工分！”我马上回答说：“这是接老贫农的班，为革命种田，不是什么八个工分、九个工分的问题。难道我们干活是为了挣工分吗！”我坚持苦练了几天，终于掌握了耖田的要领。
    在我们队里，那些又累又脏的活，我们青年和贫下中农都抢着干。但是，在评工的时候，谁也不肯多要半分半厘工分。这是因为我们都认识到，我们种田是为了革命，而不是为了工分。孙冶方之流妄图用“一切为了钱”的资产阶级思想，来毒害我们青年，我们决不上他们的当。
