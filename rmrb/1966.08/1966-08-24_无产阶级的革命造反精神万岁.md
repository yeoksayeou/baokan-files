Revolution is rebellion. The essence of Mao Zedong Thought is rebellion. When we say we must work hard on the "use" of it, we mean we must work hard on the "rebellion" of it. Daring to think, dare to speak, dare to do, dare to venture, dare to make a revolution—daring to rebel, this is the most basic and precious quality of a proletarian revolutionary, the fundamental principle of proletarian party spirit! Not to rebel is one hundred percent revisionism!

Revisionism has ruled the school for seventeen years. If we do not rebel now, when will we?

Some people who dared to oppose rebellion suddenly become hesitant today, stuttering and mumbling. What is too one-sided? What is too arrogant? What is too violent? What is too excessive?

All of this is nonsense! If you want to oppose, just oppose. Why be so shy about it?

Since we want to rebel, we cannot let you stop us! We want to make the atmosphere thick with the smell of gunpowder. We will throw grenades and explosive charges, engage in a big fight, a big battle. Let all the "humanity" and "comprehensive" views go to hell!

You say we are too one-sided? What kind of comprehensive view do you want? It seems your comprehensive view is "synthesis," it is eclecticism.

You say we are too arrogant? We are exactly going to be "arrogant." Chairman Mao said: "Dung heap of the feudal lords of a thousand households." We not only want to overthrow the reactionaries in the middle school, we also want to overthrow all the reactionaries in the world. Revolutionaries take the world as their responsibility, how can we not be "arrogant"?

You say we are too violent? We are exactly going to be violent! How can we be soft and gentle with revisionism? Kindness to the enemy is cruelty to the revolution!

You say we are too excessive? To be honest, your so-called not excessive is reformism, it is "peaceful transition." This is an illusion! We are going to knock you down and step on you!

There are also some people who are terrified of the revolution, terrified of rebellion. You follow the rules, obey orders, and hide in the shell of revisionism. As soon as there is a sign of rebellion, you become nervous. These days, the relentless criticism has been ringing in your ears, and you are trembling with fear. Don't you feel uncomfortable? How can you live like this?

Revolutionaries are like the Monkey King, with a powerful staff, immense magical powers, and boundless supernatural abilities. This is not something else, but the invincible great Mao Zedong Thought. We are going to wield the staff, display our magical powers, and use our supernatural abilities to turn the old world upside down, make people and horses fall over, scatter like fallen flowers, and make it chaotic. The more chaotic, the better! For today's revisionist Tsinghua Middle School, we must rebel, rebel thoroughly! We must stage a proletarian "Monkey King Uproar," and fight our way to a new world for the proletariat!

Long live the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat's rebellion!

    无产阶级的革命造反精神万岁
    革命就是造反，毛泽东思想的灵魂就是造反。我们说，要在“用”字上狠下功夫，就是说，主要在“造反”二字上下功夫。敢想、敢说、敢做、敢闯、敢革命，一句话敢造反，这是无产阶级革命家最基本最可贵的品质，是无产阶级党性的基本原则！不造反就是百分之一百的修正主义！
    修正主义统治学校十七年了，现在不反，更待何时？
    有些大胆的反对造反的人，今天突然变得忸怩起来，絮絮叨叨，吞吞吐吐。什么太片面了呀，什么太狂妄了呀，什么太粗暴了呀，什么太过分了呀。
    这统统是谬论！要反对就反对，何必羞羞答答的呢？
    我们既然要造反，就由不得你们了！我们就是要把火药味搞得浓浓的。爆破筒、手榴弹一起投过去，来一场大搏斗、大厮杀。什么“人情”呀，什么“全面”呀，都滚一边去！
    你们不是说我们太片面了吗？你们要的是什么样的全面呢？看来你们的全面是“合二而一”，是折衷主义。
    你们不是说我们太狂妄吗？我们就是要“狂妄”。毛主席说：“粪土当年万户侯”。我们不但要打倒附中的反动派，我们还要打倒全世界的反动派。革命者以天下为己任，不“狂妄”怎么行呢？
    你们不是说我们太粗暴了吗？我们就是要粗暴！对待修正主义怎么能缠缠绵绵，大搞温情主义呢？对敌人的温情，就是对革命的残忍！
    你们不是说我们太过分了吗？老实说，你们所谓不过分，就是改良主义，就是“和平过渡”。这是妄想！我们就是要把你们打翻在地上，再踏上一只脚！
    还有些人，对革命害怕得要死，对造反害怕得要死。你们循规蹈矩、唯唯诺诺，缩在修正主义的蜗牛壳里，一有造反的风声，你们就神经紧张。这些日子，无情的斥责声天天送入你们的耳中，你们天天心惊胆颤，你们不感到难受吗？你们怎么活得下去呢？
    革命者就是孙猴子，金箍棒厉害得很，神通广大得很，法力无边得很，这不是别的，正是战无不胜的伟大的毛泽东思想。我们就是要抡大棒、显神通、施法力，把旧世界打个天翻地覆，打个人仰马翻，打个落花流水，打得乱乱的，越乱越好！对今天这个修正主义的清华附中，就要这样大反特反，反到底！搞一场无产阶级的大闹天宫，杀出一个无产阶级的新世界！
    无产阶级的革命造反精神万岁！
