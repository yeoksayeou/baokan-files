On August 23rd, when I entered the Beijing Red Flag Street Li Xin (formerly Rui Xiu Xiang) Silk and Cloth Store, I saw many spirited Red Guards: some were engraving wax plates, printing declarations; some were carrying out one item after another of feudalistic stinky antiques; and others were rushing about, as if there was some urgent matter. With an excited heart, I asked, "Which schools are you all from?"

"We are Red Guards from twelve middle schools! We are 'rebelling' here, rebelling against feudalism, rebelling against the bourgeoisie!" one Red Guard replied. Two Red Guards in yellow military uniforms then told me the following vivid story.

These young fighters originally did not know each other. On a Sunday, they each pasted notices, ultimatums, slogans, and appeals on the streets of Dazhalan. As they pasted, they noticed that everyone had red armbands, so they naturally gathered together.

Someone suggested, "We are all Chairman Mao's Red Guards. Let's join forces and 'rebel'! Wherever there is something that does not align with Chairman Mao's thoughts, we will rebel there!"

As they passed by Rui Xiu Xiang, a Red Guard glanced inside the store and shouted, "Quick, go in! Go in!" As soon as they entered, they tore down a picture promoting feudalism with a "bang."

Their revolutionary actions gained the enthusiastic support of the revolutionary workers in the store, who eagerly pulled the Red Guards' hands and said, "Comrades, come with us, there are still many things inside! Previously, we couldn't touch them."

"Monkeys leap with golden cudgels, the sky clears of dust and grime." This group of revolutionary "rebels," led by the store workers, stormed into Rui Xiu Xiang! They searched from the upper floors to the basement, from the front rooms to the backyards, and from every hidden, dark corner, they uncovered countless contracts, American and British records, old almanacs, female commercial labels, lanterns, peculiar screens, and flower stands—all feudalistic and capitalist items. They tore and smashed them, piling them up in a small room. Then they painted over the red lacquer and ancient paintings on the walls that had feudal superstitions. While thoroughly smashing feudalism and capitalism, they established new proletarian customs: they immediately sent someone to buy fifty portraits of Chairman Mao and framed a large portrait, hanging it in the center of the store. Under the fierce attack of these revolutionary young fighters, in an instant, Rui Xiu Xiang became a "Li Xin" store!

To thoroughly smash the remnants of feudalism and capitalism in the store, the Red Guards mobilized the store's masses, and that very night, they fought against the bourgeoisie in power.

In a few days, these young fighters, who originally did not know each other, became familiar with each other through the red armbands on their arms; through Mao Zedong Thought, they united as one, forming a strong fighting unit! Together with the revolutionary workers of Rui Xiu Xiang, they spread the socialist wind and ignited the revolutionary fire!

    一块“造反”去！
    八月二十三日，当我走进北京红旗街立新（原瑞蚨祥）绸布店的时候，就看到许多英姿飒爽的红卫兵：有的刻蜡版，印宣言；有的搬着一件件封建主义的臭古董；还有的奔来奔去，像有啥急事儿。我怀着兴奋的心情问道：“你们都是哪个学校的？”
    “咱们是十二个中学的红卫兵！在这儿‘造反’，造封建主义的反，造资产阶级的反！”一位红卫兵这样回答后，两位身穿黄军装的红卫兵，便向我讲述了下面一段生动的故事。
    这些小将们原来素不相识。星期日，他们各自在大栅栏街上贴通告、通牒、标语、呼吁书。贴着贴着，他们瞧见各人手臂上都戴着红袖章，就自自然然地聚拢起来了。
    有人提议道：“咱们都是毛主席的红卫兵，合在一块儿‘造反’去！看哪儿有不符合毛主席思想的，咱们就反到哪里去！”
    他们从瑞蚨祥走过时，有位红卫兵向店里瞥了一眼，便喊道：“快进去！快进去！”他们一进门，就“啪”地一声把一张宣扬封建主义的画撕了下来。
    他们这种革命行动，获得商店革命职工的热烈支持，纷纷拉着红卫兵的手说：“同志们，跟我们来，里面还大有东西呵！以前就是触不动。”
    “金猴奋起千钧棒，玉宇澄清万里埃。”这群革命的“造反”者，在商店职工的带领下，闯进了瑞蚨祥！他们从楼上查到地下室，从前屋搜到后院，从一切隐蔽的、黑暗的角落，翻出了许许多多契约，美、英唱片，旧黄历，美女商标，宫灯，稀奇古怪的画屏、花盘等封建主义、资本主义的东西，他们连撕带砸，堆了一小屋。接着又涂掉了墙壁上带有封建迷信色彩的红漆和古画。在大破封建主义、资本主义的同时，他们大立无产阶级的新风：当即派人买了五十张毛主席像，又把巨幅像嵌进镜框里，悬挂在商店中央。在这些革命小将的猛烈攻击下，一刹那工夫，瑞蚨祥变成了一个“立新”的商店！
    为了彻底捣毁这个商店里的封建主义、资本主义残余，红卫兵放手发动商店群众，当晚就向资产阶级当权派进行了斗争。
    几天来，这些素不相识的小将们，凭着各人手臂上的红袖章互相熟悉了；凭着毛泽东思想，大家团结得像一个铁锤，结成了一个坚强的战斗整体！他们同瑞蚨祥商店革命职工一起大煽社会主义之风，大点革命之火！　本报记者
