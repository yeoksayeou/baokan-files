Please allow me to express, on behalf of the Tanzanian delegation of writers, our gratitude to Vice Mayor Liang Guobin of Shanghai, Comrade Zhang Chengzong, Comrade Jin Zhonghua, Chairman Guo Moruo of the Presidium of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers, Secretary-General Senanayake of the Permanent Secretariat of the Asian and African Writers, and the people of Shanghai.

Comrades and friends,

We are deeply grateful for your arrangements for this mass rally. This shows that you have given great attention to the issues we discussed during the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers and have a deep understanding of these issues. Your understanding and concern have increased our strength and courage in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

We Asian and African writers are in an era of arduous struggle. We are engaged in a struggle against imperialism led by the United States and its lackeys, and against old and new colonialism. We are also fighting to defend the integrity of the Asian and African camp. In the face of these struggles, we need unity more than ever before and yearn for it. We need unity in thought, purpose, and common goals. We know that U.S. imperialism and its lackeys will surely fail. We also know that old and new colonialism will surely fail. We are convinced that they will all fail. However, at the same time, we must be vigilant and strengthen our struggle. When we say we will defeat them, they also say they will defeat us. Therefore, we must also maintain high vigilance. Their spies are working desperately, and their lackeys are sometimes among us. We must show no mercy to U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, because they have no concept of mercy. Mercy is foreign to them. Cruelty is their daily routine, killing is their joy, and making the Asian and African peoples bleed is their goal. They want to rule and exploit the whole world. Therefore, we must show no mercy to those who cooperate with them directly or indirectly, openly or secretly.

The struggle against U.S. imperialism is going well. The Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers held in Beijing, China, from June 27 to July 9, 1966, is a good sign of our struggle against imperialism moving forward. The resolutions unanimously adopted by the conference have had a good influence on uniting the goals of the Asian and African peoples. The success of this conference is a big step forward in the direction of defeating U.S. imperialism. The democratic manner in which the conference was held and the unanimous agreement on various resolutions prove that there is a common understanding among the Asian and African peoples. Although the conference was successful, we must not forget the long and obstacle-filled road ahead of us. The Soviet Union attempted to split the Asian and African movement by organizing another emergency conference in Cairo, but this attempt failed. It will hold a so-called Asian and African Writers Conference in Baku in August. We have sufficient grounds to believe that this attempt will also fail. But it will not stop there. It will continue to try again and again, and merely hoping for its failure will not do. It is already among us and within our camp. Can we continue to tolerate its splitting activities within our camp? Can we continue to pat its shoulder when it sets one member against another? If the answer is yes, then we will not have a revolutionary Asian and African writers' movement, but will be providing a place for imperialist activities. I believe the correct answer should be "no," without any doubt. Such members in this movement must be dealt with appropriately.

In this era of struggle and aggression, the Asian and African writers' camp must be the strongest and must not be in disarray. We should first ask ourselves, "Do we treat each other sincerely?" "Do we agree on common principles?" Let us examine ourselves to see if there is any insincerity. If there is, we must get rid of it. The Asian and African writers' movement is a revolutionary movement. This movement is fighting a battle against imperialism and its lackeys and reactionaries. In more polite language, it is a movement against imperialism and reactionaries. Undoubtedly, this movement does not allow for a middle position.

Not revolutionary means counter-revolutionary. There is no other possibility. If someone is counter-revolutionary, whether they know it or not, whether intentionally or unintentionally, they are cooperating with imperialism. Today, there are only two camps in the world: the imperialist colonialist camp and the anti-imperialist anti-colonialist camp. There is no third camp. Whoever leaves one camp naturally falls into the other. The goal of the camp opposing imperialism, colonialism, and reactionaries, that is, the camp of revolutionary peoples, is the same: to defeat U.S.-led imperialism and old and new colonialism in all fields, political, cultural, and economic.

We Asian and African revolutionary writers fully support the statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China on the Vietnam issue, and we also support Chairman Liu Shaoqi's statement on the Vietnam issue. We have consistently supported and will continue to support the Vietnamese people wholeheartedly with words and deeds. The Vietnamese people are a member of our camp. If when Vietnam is attacked by U.S. imperialism, other members stand by and do nothing, then the next time it will be another member's turn, and so on until the entire camp is eliminated. Therefore, we believe we have the duty to support the Vietnamese people in their heroic struggle against the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys. The main agenda of our conference is to support the struggle of the Vietnamese people. The success of the conference vividly shows the full support of the Asian and African peoples for the just struggle of the Vietnamese people. The United States not only attempts to crush one of our members, Vietnam, but also attempts to separate Taiwan from China to invade our host country, China. Taiwan is part of China, and we have no doubt that it will forever be part of China. The fingers of U.S. imperialism reaching Taiwan will soon be cut off. We should also support the Chinese people in cutting off this finger reaching Taiwan.

Comrades and friends,

While supporting the Vietnamese people and supporting the Chinese people in liberating Taiwan, we also strongly support other Asian, African, and Arab countries that are still suffering from the aggressive atrocities of U.S. imperialism and colonialism. We also support the countries of Latin America. Although imperialism is like a greedy cat, as soon as it smells fish, it sticks its nose in, we must cut off this nose, and we will definitely cut it off.

Comrades and friends,

After the conclusion of this conference, we visited some places in China. Our visits to these places were pleasant and enjoyable, and also an opportunity to learn. We saw with our own eyes the tremendous development since liberation. We saw a radiant and prosperous China. The astonishing development of China's agriculture and industry since liberation is something one would not believe without seeing it. The great role of the Cultural Revolution will surely dazzle observers. We must admit that the diligent spirit of the Chinese people has left a deep impression on us. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, nothing is impossible. They make barren land productive, and they turn stone mountains into high-yield units. The Chinese people, guided by Mao Zedong Thought, are arming themselves with Mao Zedong Thought and are rapidly advancing towards great achievements, victories, and prosperity. Isn't that so? They are advancing under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is not only the beacon for the victory of the Chinese people but also the beacon for the victory of the peoples of the world. Mao Zedong Thought not only illuminates the Chinese workers, peasants, and soldiers but also far exceeds the borders of China, illuminating the broad masses of laboring people around the world. Anyone, whether in China or elsewhere, who arms themselves with Mao Zedong Thought will surely achieve victory. Any struggle under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought will surely achieve victory.

If I do not mention the extremely enthusiastic welcome of the Chinese people, I will not have fulfilled my duty. Wherever we went, we were warmly welcomed by the elderly, youth, and children. At train stations, airports, and streets, and even at the beautiful Lu Mountain, crowds of people came out to welcome us, singing, dancing, waving, and smiling. The smiles of men, women, and children will be forever etched in our minds. All this is indeed a good symbol of sincere friendship, and for the purpose of overthrowing U.S. imperialism, we need such friendship. We will never forget the grand gathering on West Lake in Hangzhou. That was indeed an unforgettable night. Some people say, "There is paradise in heaven, and there is Hangzhou on earth." But we think that on the night of the grand gathering on the lake, paradise has already moved to Hangzhou. Let us shout:

Down with U.S. imperialism!

Victory to the Vietnamese people!

Long live the unity of the Asian and African peoples!

Long live Chairman Mao!

### 坦桑尼亚代表团团长哈桑尼的讲话

    坦桑尼亚代表团团长哈桑尼的讲话
    请允许我代表坦桑尼亚作家代表团，感谢上海副市长梁国斌同志、张承宗同志、金仲华同志，感谢亚非作家紧急会议主席团主席郭沫若同志，感谢亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克同志，感谢上海的人民群众。
    同志们，朋友们，
    我们深深感谢你们安排这次群众大会。这表明你们对我们在亚非作家紧急会议期间所探讨的问题给予很大的关怀并对这些问题有深刻的了解。你们的这种了解和关怀增加了我们进行反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争的力量和勇气。
    我们亚非作家处在一个艰苦斗争的时代。我们正在进行着反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗的斗争和反对新老殖民主义的斗争。我们也为保卫亚非阵营的完整而斗争。在这些斗争面前，我们现在比以往任何时刻都更需要团结，更渴望团结。我们需要在思想、目的和共同目标等各方面的团结。我们知道美帝国主义及其走狗必败。我们也知道新老殖民主义必将失败。我们确信不疑它们将统统失败。但是同时我们必须提高警惕、加强战斗。当我们说我们将打败他们的时候，他们也说他们将打败我们。因此，我们也必须保持高度警惕。他们的特务正在拚命活动，他们的走狗有时就在我们中间。我们对美帝国主义及其走狗丝毫不能留情，因为他们没有“留情”这个字眼，这个字眼对他们是陌生的。“残酷”是他们的家常便饭，杀人是他们的欢乐，使亚非人民流血是他们的目的。他们就是要统治和剥削全世界。因此，我们对那些直接或间接地、公开或隐蔽地同他们合作的人也丝毫不能留情。
    反对美帝国主义的斗争进行得很好。一九六六年六月二十七日至七月九日在中国北京举行的亚非作家紧急会议是我们的反对帝国主义的斗争向前推进的良好标志。会议一致通过的决议对统一亚非人民的目标起了良好的影响。这次会议所取得的成功是朝着打败美帝国主义的方向迈进的一大步。举行会议的民主方式以及在各项决议上所取得的一致意见证明在亚非人民之间有着共同的了解。尽管会议取得了成功，但是我们绝不应当忘记摆在我们面前的充满了障碍的漫长的道路。苏联企图用在开罗组织另一个紧急会议来分裂亚非运动，但是这个企图失败了。它将在八月间在巴库举行所谓的亚非作家会议。我们有充分的根据认为这个企图也一定要失败。但是它绝不会就此罢休。它将一次又一次继续不断地尝试，而光是希望它失败是无济于事的。它现在就在我们之间而且在我们的阵营之中。我们能继续容忍它在我们的阵营中进行分裂活动吗？我们能在它把一个成员同另一个成员对立起来的时候继续拍他的肩膀吗？如果回答是肯定的话，那么我们就不会有革命的亚非作家运动了，而是意味着给帝国主义活动的场所了。我认为正确的回答应当是“不”，这是没有疑问的。对这个运动中的这种成员必须加以应有的处理。
    在这斗争和侵略的时代，亚非作家阵营应当是最坚强的而且必须是毫不紊乱的。我们应该首先问问自己，“我们相互之间是否以诚相待？”，“我们是否在共同原则上意见一致？”让我们扪心自问，检查一下是否有丝毫不诚实的成分。如果有，我们就应当去掉它。亚非作家运动是个革命的运动。这个运动正在进行一场反对帝国主义及其走狗和反动派的战斗。用斯文一些的语言来说，它是一个反对帝国主义和反动派的运动。毫无疑问这个运动不允许有中间立场。
    不革命，就是反革命。别的可能是没有的。如果谁是反革命，不管他是否知道，不管是有意无意，谁就是同帝国主义合作。今天世界上只有两个阵营，即帝国主义殖民主义阵营和反帝反殖阵营。没有第三个阵营。谁要是脱离了一个阵营，他就自然而然地落入了另一个阵营。反对帝国主义、殖民主义和反动派的阵营即革命人民的阵营的目标是一致的，那就是在政治、文化和经济等一切领域中打败以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义。
    我们亚非革命作家完全支持中国人民政府关于越南问题的声明，我们也支持刘少奇主席关于越南问题的声明。我们一贯支持而且将继续以语言和行动全心全意地支持越南人民。越南人民是我们阵营中的一个成员。如果当越南受到美帝国主义攻击时，其他成员袖手旁观，那么下次就要轮到另一个成员受攻击，这样一个一个下去直到整个阵营被消灭为止。因此，我们认为我们有义务支持越南人民反对美国侵略者及其走狗的英勇斗争。我们的会议的主要议程是支持越南人民的斗争。会议所取得的成功生动地表示了亚非人民给予越南人民的正义斗争的全力支持。美国不只企图打垮我们的一个成员越南而且企图把台湾省同中国分割开来，以便侵入我们的东道国中国。台湾是中国的一部分而且我们毫不怀疑，它将永远是中国的一部分。美帝国主义伸到台湾的手指在不久的将来将被斩断。我们也应当支持中国人民斩断这只按在台湾的手指。
    同志们，朋友们，
    我们在支持越南人民和支持中国人民解放台湾的同时，也大力支持还在遭受美帝国主义和殖民主义侵略暴行的其他亚洲、非洲和阿拉伯国家。我们也支持拉丁美洲各国。虽然帝国主义象一只贪吃的猫，一闻到有鱼腥的味道，就把鼻子伸进去，但是我们一定要把这只鼻子割掉，我们一定能把它割掉。
    同志们，朋友们：
    这次会议结束后，我们访问了中国的一些地方。我们在这些地方的访问是令人高兴和愉快的，而且也是一个学习的机会。我们亲眼看到解放以来的巨大发展。我们看到了光芒四射的、繁荣的中国。解放以来中国的农业和工业取得了惊人的发展，这是非亲眼看到不会相信的。文化革命的巨大作用一定会使观察家眼花缭乱。我们必须承认，中国人民的勤劳精神给我们留下深刻的印象。在共产党和毛主席的指导下，没有办不到的事情。他们使贫瘠的土地增产，他们把石头山变成丰产的单位。中国人民在毛主席思想的指导下，以毛主席思想武装自己，他们正很快地走向巨大的成就、胜利和繁荣。难道不是吗？他们是在毛泽东思想的光芒指引下前进的。毛主席思想不但是中国人民取得胜利的指路明灯，而且也是世界各国人民取得胜利的指路明灯。毛主席思想不但照亮了中国工农兵，而且远远超过了中国边界，照亮了世界上的广大劳动人民。任何人，不论是在中国或在别的地方，只要是用毛泽东思想武装起来，就一定能取得胜利。任何在毛主席思想指导下的斗争也一定能够取得胜利。
    如果我不提一下中国人民的极其热烈的欢迎，那我没有尽到职责。我们所到之处，都受到老年人、青年人和儿童的热烈欢迎。在车站、飞机场和街道上甚至于在美丽的庐山，潮涌般的人群出来欢迎我们，他们唱歌、跳舞、招手、笑容满面。男女和儿童们的笑容将永远铭刻在我们的脑子里。这一切确是真诚友谊的良好象征，而为了打倒美帝国主义，我们需要这样的友谊。我们永远不会忘记杭州西湖上大联欢。那确是令人难忘的一夜。有人说，上有天堂，下有杭州西湖。但是我们认为，在湖上大联欢之夜，天上已没有天堂了，而是移到杭州了。让我们高呼：
    打倒美帝国主义！
    胜利属于越南人民！
    亚非人民团结万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
