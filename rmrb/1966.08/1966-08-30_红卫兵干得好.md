The Red Guards have done well,
Done well, done well,
The Red Guards' battle reports are triumphant,
The five lakes and four seas are leaping with joy,
Revolutionary people around the world are clapping and laughing.

Done well, done well,
The "Four Olds" have been thoroughly swept away,
Streets and shops have new appearances,
Everywhere presents a new look.

Done well, done well,
The arrogance of the bourgeoisie has been thoroughly swept away,
The roots of revisionism have been uprooted,
The iron fortress is firmly secure.

Study the Sixteen Points, apply the Sixteen Points,
Master the weapon of struggle,
The Party's decisions are engraved in our hearts,
Chairman Mao's words are the most important.

Salute to the Red Guards! Learn from the Red Guards!
Soldiers will always fight alongside you,
Let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought,
Fly high across the entire universe...

    红卫兵干得好
    干得好，干得好，
    红卫兵战斗传捷报，
    五湖四海在欢跳，
    全世界革命人民拍手笑。
    干得好，干得好，
    “四旧”统统被冲掉，
    街道商店换新装，
    处处呈现新面貌。
    干得好，干得好，
    资产阶级威风狠狠扫，
    修正主义根子连根拔，
    铁打的江山牢又牢。
    学习十六条，运用十六条，
    战斗的武器要掌握好，
    党的决定刻心间，
    毛主席的话最最重要。
    向红卫兵致敬！向红卫兵学习！
    战士永远和你们战斗在一道，
    让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，
    在整个宇宙高高飘……
