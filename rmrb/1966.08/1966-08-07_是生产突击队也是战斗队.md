Our production brigade has over 300 young male and female members who can wield both the hoe and the gun, are both builders and defenders of socialism.

If imperialism dares to invade us, we will drown it in the ocean of people's war.

Gou Jia Zhuang Production Brigade Party Branch Secretary, Shanxi Province, Linfen County, Duan Wenjun

Over the past two years, our Gou Jia Zhuang brigade has taken the People's Liberation Army as an example, actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. We have focused on both production and military training. Our brigade's over 300 young male and female members are farmers with hoes in their hands and militia with guns in their hands. Many of them are not only skilled in production but also sharpshooters in the militia. The elderly praise them, saying: "The young people educated by Chairman Mao are both literate and martial. With such successors to build and defend the socialist homeland, we are at ease."

Our Gou Jia Zhuang brigade is located by the Fen River. In the past, because we grew a lot of vegetables, we had to rely on the state for part of our grain supply each year. Last year, after these young people studied articles like "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "Qu Yuan Moves the Mountain," their vision broadened, and they decided not to rely on the state for grain. They aimed to fully utilize the Fen River's water to transform over 100 mu of riverbank into paddy fields. The party branch fully supported them. They organized 45 male and female core militia members into a shock brigade. At that time, it was bitterly cold, but they, together with the local garrison troops, fearlessly rolled up their pants and jumped into the icy water to dig mud. Thus, they transformed a large, uneven stretch of the Fen Riverbank into 120 mu of paddy fields. When it was time to transplant rice seedlings, they encountered a drought, and the Fen River's water level dropped, with insufficient water volume. They neither waited for rain nor relied on the Fen River to rise. Instead, they took the initiative, built a river dam, and dug a 4,000-meter-long irrigation canal, diverting the Fen River's water into the paddy fields to ensure timely transplanting. Now the seedlings are lush and green, and everyone who sees them is delighted. Relying on this production shock brigade, our Gou Jia Zhuang brigade has, since last winter, built two three-level water pumps and dug over 50 irrigation canals. The canals are interconnected, and the land is level and well-prepared, making the brigade's over 1,300 mu of land basically drought and flood resistant.

Our brigade's achievements in production are inseparable from organizing members to study military affairs. Many young people have learned combat skills and improved their ideological awareness through military training. Their revolutionary enthusiasm for building a new socialist countryside has greatly increased.

In the militia company, half of the members have been rated as "five-good" militia members, and 29 have become sharpshooters. They hold hoes in one hand and guns in the other, are both builders and defenders of socialism. This force is a true iron wall. If imperialism dares to invade us, we will drown it in the ocean of people's war.

    是生产突击队也是战斗队
    我们的生产大队三百多名青年男女社员，一手拿锄，一手拿枪能文善武，既是社会主义的建设者，又是社会主义的保卫者
    帝国主义如果胆敢侵犯我们，就叫它淹死在人民战争海洋中
    山西省临汾县郭家庄大队党支部书记　段文俊
    这两年，我们郭家庄大队以人民解放军为榜样，活学活用毛主席著作，既大搞生产，又大练民兵。我们大队三百多名青年男女社员，扛起锄头是农民，扛起枪杆是民兵，很多人既是生产好把式，又是民兵中的神枪手。老年人夸奖他们说：毛主席教育出来的年轻人，能文善武，有了这样的后代来建设和保卫社会主义江山，我们就放心了。
    我们郭家庄大队紧靠汾河岸边，过去因为蔬菜种得多，每年都要靠国家供应一部分粮食。去年这伙年轻人学习了《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》《愚公移山》等文章以后，眼光远大了，胸怀开阔了，决心不要国家供应粮食，要充分利用汾河的水，把一百多亩河滩改造成水稻田。党支部非常支持他们这样作，抽出四十五名男女基干民兵组成了一支突击队。当时正是天寒地冻，但是他们和当地驻军一起，不怕困难，卷起裤腿跳到冰水里去挖泥。就这样，他们把一大片高低不平的汾河滩，修成了一百二十亩水稻田。插秧的时候，又碰到了干旱，汾河水位下降，水量不足。他们一不等天下雨，二不靠汾河涨水，而是自己动手，筑起了一条拦河坝，挖了一条四千多米长的引水渠道，把汾河水截住，引入稻田，保证了适时插秧。如今秧苗一片葱绿，谁看了都喜欢。我们郭家庄大队依靠这支生产突击队，从去年冬天以来，还建成了两座三级抽水台，挖了五十多条排灌渠道，渠道配套成龙，土地平平整整，使全大队一千三百多亩土地，基本上达到了旱涝保收。
    我们大队生产上的这些成就，是同组织社员学习军事分不开的。很多青年在练兵的过程中，学会了杀敌本领，也提高了思想觉悟。他们建设社会主义新农村的革命干劲大大提高了。
    民兵连中，有一半被评为“五好”民兵，有二十九人成了神枪手。他们一手拿锄，一手拿枪，既是社会主义的建设者，又是社会主义的保卫者。这支力量是真正的铜墙铁壁，帝国主义如果胆敢侵犯我们，就叫它淹死在人民战争的海洋中。
