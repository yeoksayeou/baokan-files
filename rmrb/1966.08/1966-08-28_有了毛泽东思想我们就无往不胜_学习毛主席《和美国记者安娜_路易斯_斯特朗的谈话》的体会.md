Recently, with boundless love, faith, and admiration for Chairman Mao, I revisited and studied Chairman Mao's "Talk with American Journalist Anna Louise Strong." I found it particularly heartwarming. Chairman Mao's insightful statement from twenty years ago, that "all reactionaries are paper tigers," has been proven true by revolutionary practice.

This "Talk" has guided the Chinese people and people around the world from one victory to another, holding immense historical significance. It is of great and far-reaching importance in guiding our current struggle against imperialism and revisionism, as well as our ongoing Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. I believe that as long as we earnestly study Chairman Mao's works, strive to master and apply Mao Zedong Thought as our invincible and sharp weapon, we will certainly be clear in our direction and boundless in our strength, achieving victory in all our struggles. Whether it be imperialism, revisionism, all reactionaries, or the reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie and all ghosts and monsters, they will all be defeated and vanquished by the revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards total collapse and socialism is advancing towards global victory. Chairman Mao's words are the highest in level, the most authoritative, and the most powerful. Every sentence is the truth, and one sentence is worth ten thousand. This is absolutely true and has been proven by countless facts and will continue to be proven. I lived by Chairman Mao's side for over six years and have personal experience of this.

I remember in 1930, Chairman Mao led the poor people in my hometown of Ningdu in revolution. At that time, I served as a clerk for Chairman Mao. Once, Chairman Mao asked me, "Do you have landlords in your place? Are they powerful?" I said, "Very powerful, they have guns and knives, and are not easy to overthrow." Chairman Mao said, "They are a minority, we are the majority. As long as we rely on the poor, we can overthrow them." Later, under Chairman Mao's leadership, the big landlords and big tyrants in my hometown were indeed overthrown, and we poor people were busy "dividing land and fields." This was the first time I realized that Chairman Mao's words could be fulfilled.

During the domestic revolutionary wars, our numbers were few, and our weapons were mostly homemade guns, spears, homemade grenades, and sabers. The Kuomintang reactionaries, relying on their numerical and equipment superiority, launched continuous "encirclements and suppressions" against our base areas. The first time they came with 100,000 troops, the second time with 200,000, the third time with 300,000, and the fourth time with 500,000. Each time, the number of troops increased, but under Chairman Mao's personal command, the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army repeatedly defeated the enemy's attacks, with each defeat more miserable than the last. In 1931, our main force of the Red Army left the Jiangxi base area to open up new revolutionary base areas in northern Fujian. Chiang Kai-shek took the opportunity to personally lead 300,000 troops, equipped with airplanes and artillery, in a fierce invasion of the Jiangxi revolutionary base area, intending to annihilate us. Upon hearing this news, we immediately went to ask Chairman Mao, "The Kuomintang reactionaries have five to six times more troops than us, and their weapons are so good, can we defeat them?" Chairman Mao smiled and told us, "We are not afraid of the Kuomintang. No matter how many they come with, we have ways to defeat them. We will definitely defeat them." Under Chairman Mao's personal command, we thoroughly smashed the enemy's third "encirclement and suppression," consolidating and developing the revolutionary base areas. This again made me realize that Chairman Mao's words are effective, and wherever they are applied, they work. As long as we act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, we can win the battle.

Later, Chairman Mao led us on the Long March. The Long March covered 25,000 li. Some people were shocked to hear this, but the Red Army soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, strategically despised the enemy and difficulties, and tactically took the enemy and difficulties seriously. In the face of enemy aircraft overhead, pursuers behind, and blockers in front, we crossed the Jinsha River, rushed across the Dadu River, traversed countless mountains and rivers, and step by step completed the 25,000-li journey, arriving victoriously in Shaanxi. In those extremely arduous years, the Red Army soldiers were full of enthusiasm and revolutionary optimism, just as Chairman Mao pointed out in the poem "Long March": "Even more delightful is the snow on the Min Mountains for thousands of miles, the three armies smile after passing."

The revolutionary struggles of the Chinese people have proven that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. The anti-imperialist struggles of all revolutionary people in the world have also proven this. The battlefield in Vietnam is a powerful example. Vietnam is our close neighbor and brother. The U.S. imperialists' aggression against Vietnam is an aggression against China. We cannot stand idly by. I wholeheartedly and resolutely support the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, arm ourselves with Chairman Mao's thought of serving all the people of China and the world, highlight proletarian politics, highly advocate patriotism, proletarian internationalism, and revolutionary heroism, strengthen our preparedness, and be ready at any time to fight side by side with the Vietnamese people, to decisively, thoroughly, completely, and entirely annihilate the evil American aggressors.

Chairman Mao is the most beloved leader of the Chinese people and the greatest revolutionary teacher of the people of the world. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for the Chinese people and the beacon for the revolutionary people of the world. I will better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, especially focus on the "use" aspect, and regard studying Chairman Mao's works as my lifelong mission. I will defend Mao Zedong Thought as my highest duty. I will dedicate my life to revolution, study Chairman Mao's works, and transform my thoughts for life.

    有了毛泽东思想我们就无往不胜
    ——学习毛主席《和美国记者安娜·路易斯·斯特朗的谈话》的体会
    跟随毛主席长征的红军战士、现中国人民解放军某部师长  陈昌奉
    最近，我怀着对毛主席无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜的心情，重新学习了毛主席《和美国记者安娜·路易斯·斯特朗的谈话》，感到格外亲切。毛主席二十年前关于“一切反动派都是纸老虎”的英明论断已经被革命实践所证实。
    这篇《谈话》引导中国人民和世界人民从胜利走向胜利，具有伟大的历史意义。它对于指导当前的反帝、反修斗争和我国正在进行的无产阶级文化大革命，具有极其伟大的现实意义和深远意义。我想，只要我们认真学习毛主席著作，努力掌握和运用毛泽东思想这个战无不胜的锐利武器，我们就一定能够在斗争中方向明确，力量无穷，无往而不胜。帝国主义也罢，修正主义也罢，一切反动派也罢，资产阶级的反动学术“权威”和一切牛鬼蛇神也罢，都将统统被用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民所打倒，所战胜。
    毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。毛主席的话，水平最高，威信最高，威力最大，句句是真理，一句顶一万句。这是千真万确的，也是被无数事实所证明了并将继续证明的。我在毛主席身旁生活了六年多，对这点有切身的体会。
    记得一九三○年，毛主席在我的家乡宁都领导穷人闹革命，那时我给毛主席当公务员。有一次，毛主席问我，你们那里有没有地主？他们厉害不厉害？我说：“好厉害，他们有枪有刀，不容易打倒。”毛主席说，他们是少数，我们是多数，只要依靠穷人就能把他们打倒。后来，在毛主席的领导下，我们家乡的大地主、大土豪果真都被打倒了，我们穷人“分田分地真忙”。这使我第一次认识到毛主席说了的话，就能实现。
    国内革命战争期间，我们人数不多，用的武器都是土枪、长矛、土手榴弹、马刀等，国民党反动派凭着人数、装备上的优势，向我们根据地连续发起了“围剿”，第一次敌军来十万，第二次来二十万，第三次来三十万，第四次来五十万，人数一次比一次多，但毛主席亲自指挥中国工农红军，一次又一次地粉碎了敌人的进攻，敌人一次比一次失败的更惨。一九三一年，我们主力红军离开江西根据地到闽西北一带开辟新的革命根据地，蒋介石趁机亲自率领三十万人，装备飞机加大炮，气势汹汹，闯入江西革命根据地，妄想把我们消灭。我们听到这个消息后，马上跑去问毛主席：“国民党反动派人比我们多五六倍，武器又那样好，我们打得过他们吗？”毛主席微笑地告诉我们，国民党我们是不怕的，来得再多我们都有办法的，一定能把他们打败。在毛主席的亲自指挥下，我们彻底粉碎了敌人的第三次“围剿”，巩固和发展了革命根据地。这又使我认识到，毛主席讲的话真管用，说到做到，用到哪里哪里灵，只要按照毛主席的指示办事，就能打胜仗。
    以后，毛主席领导我们去长征。长征，路程二万五千里，有的人听了吃惊，但用毛泽东思想武装起来的红军战士，在战略上藐视敌人和困难，在战术上重视敌人和困难，在上有敌机、后有追敌、前有阻敌的情况下，我们跨过金沙江，抢渡大渡河，越过千山万水，一步一步走完了二万五千里，胜利到达陕北。在那样艰苦卓绝的年月里，红军战士情绪高涨，充满了革命乐观主义精神，正如毛主席在《长征》诗中指出的：“更喜岷山千里雪，三军过后尽开颜。”
    中国人民的革命斗争，证明了帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎，世界上一切革命人民的反帝斗争也证明了这一点。越南战场就是一个最有力的例证。越南是我们唇齿相依的兄弟邻邦。美帝国主义侵略越南就是侵略中国，我们决不能坐视。我最热烈最坚决地拥护党的八届十一中全会公报，决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，用毛主席关于为全中国人民和全世界人民服务的思想武装自己，突出无产阶级政治，高度发扬爱国主义、无产阶级国际主义和革命英雄主义精神，切实加强战备，一切工作立足于打，随时准备同越南人民并肩作战，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地消灭万恶的美国强盗。
    毛主席是中国人民最敬爱的领袖，也是世界人民最伟大的革命导师，毛泽东思想是中国人民的行动指南，也是世界人民革命的灯塔。我要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，特别在“用”字上狠下功夫，把学习好毛主席著作当作自己毕生的战斗任务，把捍卫毛泽东思想当作自己的最高天职。干一辈子革命，学习一辈子毛主席著作，改造一辈子思想。　　（新华社南昌二十七日电）
