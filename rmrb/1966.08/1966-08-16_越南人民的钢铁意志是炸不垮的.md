On August 13, U.S. imperialism brazenly dispatched aircraft to savagely bomb the suburbs of Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, targeting the Red River dike and residential areas. The wicked U.S. imperialists have once again incurred a new debt of blood against the Vietnamese people. The Chinese people strongly protest this unforgivable and heinous crime committed by U.S. imperialism. All peace-loving and justice-seeking countries and people around the world should take action to denounce the inhuman atrocities of U.S. imperialism in destroying peace facilities and massacring peaceful residents.

U.S. imperialism always assumes that the more bombs they drop and the more people they kill, the more likely the Vietnamese people will surrender. Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to All Compatriots" is a powerful response to the U.S. imperialists' war of intimidation. However, the Johnson administration remains undeterred. While the U.S. is escalating its bombing of North Vietnam, the "peace talks" conspiracy orchestrated by the U.S. keeps resurfacing. On August 11, U.S. Vice President Humphrey even shouted that the Vietnamese people should "give an inspiring response." Tragically, Humphrey and his ilk will never understand that this is no longer an era where people fear foreign guns and cannons. Bombs can destroy a section of the Red River dike, but they will never shatter the Vietnamese people's iron resolve to fight the war of resistance against U.S. aggression to victory. On the contrary, the more bombs the U.S. drops and the more peaceful residents it kills, the more fierce the Vietnamese people's vengeful fury will become. The blood-stained U.S. aggressors will ultimately be reduced to ashes by the flames of the Vietnamese people's struggle.

　　越南人民的钢铁意志是炸不垮的
　　本报评论员
    八月十三日，美帝国主义悍然派遣飞机野蛮轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内市郊的红河堤坝和居民区。万恶的美帝国主义，对越南人民又欠下了一笔新的血债。中国人民最强烈地抗议美帝国主义这一不可饶恕的滔天罪行。全世界一切爱好和平、主持正义的国家和人们，都应该行动起来，声讨美帝国主义毁坏和平设施、屠杀和平居民的灭绝人性的兽行。
    美帝国主义总以为，炸弹扔得越多，人杀得越多，越南人民就会屈服。胡志明主席的《告全国同胞书》，是对美帝国主义战争讹诈政策的有力回答。但是，约翰逊政府仍不死心。就在美国扩大轰炸越南北方的同时，美国策动的“和谈”阴谋，却不断地冒了出来。八月十一日，美国副总统汉弗莱还在叫嚷，要越南人民“作出令人鼓舞的回答”。可悲的是，汉弗莱之流至死也不会懂得，现在早已不是人民害怕洋枪洋炮的时代了。炸弹，可以炸塌红河的一段堤坝，却永远炸不垮越南人民把抗美救国斗争进行到胜利的钢铁决心。相反地，美国的炸弹丢得越多，美国残杀的和平居民越多，越南人民复仇的怒火就越炽烈。血债累累的美国侵略者，终将被越南人民的斗争怒火烧成灰烬。
