By the Federation of Black African Students in France delegation, which is composed of ten countries, recently visited the hometown of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao—Shaoshan; and visited the early revolutionary activity memorial sites of Chairman Mao, Hunan First Normal School and Qing Shui Tang. They enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao as not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of the revolutionary people of the whole world.

These African youth friends, with boundless reverence, wrote words of praise for the great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought:

	“Glory forever belongs to the one who leads a quarter of humanity to victory over imperialism and all reactionaries and march towards complete victory!
	Glory belongs to the great Mao Zedong Thought!
	People of the whole world, especially the people of Africa, regard your thought as our guide in the struggle against imperialism and all reactionaries.”

Many African youth friends, with hearts full of unlimited love, adoration, and admiration for Chairman Mao, excitedly said: “Chairman Mao is forever our shining example to learn from.” “We will forever regard Mao Zedong Thought as our belief.” They sang the songs “The East Is Red,” “The Ship of the Sea Depends on the Helmsman,” and “Long Live Chairman Mao! Ten Thousand Times Long Live Chairman Mao!” which they themselves composed, over and over again in Chinese.

Through the visits, the friendship between the Chinese people and youth and the African youth friends was further enhanced, and unity was strengthened. After our country's youth introduced their experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to the African friends, the African friends praised: “The Chinese youth armed with Mao Zedong Thought are truly remarkable, they are the reliable red successors of New China. Imperialism's attempt to carry out peaceful evolution on the third and fourth generations of New China will definitely not achieve its goal. With the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, China will forever be revolutionary.”

    留法黑非洲学联代表团对毛主席无限热爱无限崇拜
    光荣属于伟大的毛泽东思想
    用毛泽东思想武装的中国青少年是可靠的红色接班人
    新华社长沙二十九日电　由十个国家组成的留法黑非洲学生联合会代表团，最近参观访问了中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的家乡——韶山；访问了毛主席早期革命活动纪念地湖南第一师范学校和清水塘。他们热情称颂毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，也是全世界革命人民的伟大领袖。
    这些非洲青年朋友以无限崇敬的心情，写下了歌颂伟大的领袖毛主席和毛泽东思想的赞词：
      “光荣永远属于领导四分之一人类取得战胜帝国主义和一切反动派走向完全胜利的人！
    光荣属于伟大的毛泽东思想！
    全世界人民特别是非洲人民，把你的思想当成我们对帝国主义和一切反动派进行斗争的指南。”
    许多非洲青年朋友怀着对毛主席无限热爱、无限崇拜、无限敬佩的心情激动地说：“毛主席永远是我们学习的光辉榜样。”“我们永远把毛泽东思想作为自己的信念。”他们一次又一次用中国话高声歌唱《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》和他们自己编写的《毛主席万岁！万万岁！》等歌曲。
    通过参观访问，还增进了中国人民和青年同非洲青年朋友的友谊，加强了团结。我国青少年向非洲朋友们介绍了活学活用毛主席著作的体会后，非洲朋友赞扬说：“用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国青少年真了不起，是新中国可靠的红色接班人。帝国主义妄想对新中国第三代、第四代推行和平演变，肯定是达不到目的的。有毛泽东思想的光辉照耀，中国就永远是革命的。”
