In the new high tide of the Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of militiamen have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, earnestly studying, familiarizing themselves with, mastering, and applying the Sixteen Points. They use the Sixteen Points as a weapon to thoroughly criticize the "four olds" and establish the "four news," vowing to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

After the Central Committee's decision on the Cultural Revolution was issued, the broad masses of militiamen immediately launched study activities. They said, Mao Zedong personally presided over the formulation of the Sixteen Points, which is the latest embodiment of Mao Zedong Thought and the action program for the Cultural Revolution. To earnestly study, familiarize oneself with, master, and apply the Sixteen Points is a revolutionary need, a need for struggle, and a guarantee for the victory of the Cultural Revolution.

In Yunnan Province, on the southwestern border, various ethnic militiamen and armed personnel held various meetings and symposiums to study and discuss the Sixteen Points. The militiamen of Kunming Machine Tool Factory said in a symposium that the Sixteen Points are like a torch illuminating the path to victory in the Cultural Revolution. We will definitely act according to the Sixteen Points and resolutely carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end. The militiamen of Nan'ao Island in Guangdong Province specially held a symposium to study the Sixteen Points. Many militiamen said at the meeting that the decision of the Central Committee is the great program guiding China's Cultural Revolution and the latest development of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We island militiamen will resolutely implement the Sixteen Points, always listen to Chairman Mao's words, always follow Chairman Mao in the great storms of class struggle, raise our consciousness and skills in struggle, distinguish right from wrong, and clarify the enemy, and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end. The militiamen of the Red Flag Militia Company in Gansu Province—Hejiazhuang Militia Company in Lixian County—said that the Sixteen Points are a mirror that reveals the true form of all ghosts and monsters, leaving them nowhere to hide. The Sixteen Points are a compass that guides us to achieve a thorough victory in the Cultural Revolution. In recent days, the militiamen of this company have studied the Sixteen Points sentence by sentence and word by word, determined to firmly grasp this weapon and push the Cultural Revolution to a new high tide.

While earnestly studying the Sixteen Points, the broad masses of militiamen and armed personnel also widely carried out propaganda activities. They said, arming more revolutionary masses with the Sixteen Points will produce tremendous material force in the Cultural Revolution movement. The militiamen of Shanghai Yangshupu Power Plant, with a glorious tradition of struggle, organized a propaganda team of more than 300 people to go to the streets and propagate the Sixteen Points and the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee to the masses. The armed personnel and militiamen of Qujing, Wenshan, Dali, Chuxiong, and Lincang in Yunnan Province respectively organized many propaganda teams, going deep into remote mountainous areas, minority villages, factories, and rural areas, enthusiastically explaining the Sixteen Points and the communiqué to the masses, performing art programs to propagate the Sixteen Points, and helping the masses to produce blackboard newspapers and wall newspapers, which were warmly welcomed by the broad masses of various ethnic groups. They said: the Sixteen Points are true in every sentence and every word shines with gold. Holding the Sixteen Points firmly, the Cultural Revolution will have the correct direction and be able to overthrow all ghosts and monsters.

The broad masses of militiamen also resolutely declared that in the magnificent Cultural Revolution movement, they will further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and increase vigilance and strengthen preparedness. If the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs dare to impose war on the Chinese people, the militiamen will, together with the People's Liberation Army, under the great commander Chairman Mao, resolutely break the backbone of the aggressors and drown the aggressors in the vast ocean of people's war.

The Red Guards of Shenyang First Light Industry School, taking the People's Liberation Army as an example, actively went to the streets to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and the great significance of the Cultural Revolution to the masses.

    据新华社三十日讯　在无产阶级文化大革命的新高潮中，全国广大民兵更高举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，认真学习十六条，熟悉十六条，掌握十六条，运用十六条，以十六条为武器，大破“四旧”，大立
  “四新”，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定公布以后，广大民兵立即展开学习活动。他们说，毛主席亲自主持制定的十六条，是毛泽东思想的最新体现，是文化大革命的行动纲领。认真学习十六条，熟悉十六条，掌握十六条，运用十六条，这是革命的需要，斗争的需要，是文化大革命取得胜利的保证。西南边疆云南省各族民兵和人民武装干部，举行各种集会和座谈会，学习讨论十六条。昆明机床厂的民兵们在座谈时说，十六条像万丈火炬，照亮了文化大革命的胜利道路，我们一定按照十六条办事，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。广东省南澳岛的民兵，专门举行了学习十六条的讲用会。许多民兵在会上说，党中央这个决定是指导我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大纲领，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的最新发展。我们海岛民兵坚决执行十六条，永远听毛主席的话，永远跟着毛主席在阶级斗争的大风大浪中锻炼，在斗争中提高觉悟，增长才干，辨明是非，分清敌我，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。甘肃省红旗民兵连——礼县何家庄民兵连的民兵们说，十六条是照妖镜，照得一切牛鬼蛇神原形毕露，无处躲藏。十六条是指南针，指引我们取得文化大革命的彻底胜利。连日来，这个民兵连的民兵们逐条逐句地认真学习十六条，决心牢牢地掌握这一武器，把文化大革命推向一个新的高潮。
    广大民兵和人民武装干部在认真学好十六条的同时，还广泛开展宣传活动。他们说，用十六条武装更多的革命群众，就会在文化大革命运动中产生巨大的物质力量。具有光荣斗争传统的上海杨树浦发电厂的民兵，组织了三百多人的宣传队，走上街头，向广大群众宣传十六条和党的八届十一中全会公报。云南省曲靖、文山、大理、楚雄、临沧等地的人民武装干部和民兵，分别组织了很多宣传组，深入到偏僻山区、少数民族村寨和工厂、农村，热情地向群众讲解十六条和公报，表演宣传十六条的文艺节目，并帮助群众出黑板报、墙报，受到各族广大群众的热烈欢迎。他们说：十六条句句是真理，字字闪金光，紧紧掌握十六条，文化大革命就有了正确的方向，就能斗倒一切牛鬼蛇神。
    广大民兵还坚决表示，在轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，要进一步活学活用毛主席著作，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，百倍提高警惕，加强战备。如果美帝国主义及其帮凶胆敢把战争强加在中国人民头上，民兵们誓与人民解放军一起，在伟大统帅毛主席的指挥下，坚决打断侵略者的脊骨，把侵略者淹没在人民战争的汪洋大海里。（附图片）
