Comrades! Students!

You have all wholeheartedly raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and for the great cause of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, for our beloved motherland, for your generation to link up with the older generation of revolutionaries, to march forward forever under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to build our country into a great socialist state, to ensure that our great motherland will never change color, and to support the revolutionary struggles of all oppressed peoples and nations against imperialism and its running dogs, you, under the call of Chairman Mao, must fight against the ideology of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, and sweep away all ghosts and monsters. You have come to the great capital of Beijing, to the capital of our motherland, to the center of the revolution of our motherland, to the center of the proletarian revolution. We warmly welcome you.

As our great leader Chairman Mao often tells us, all revolutionaries, all revolutionary youth, must face storms and hardships. Revolutionaries cannot grow in a greenhouse but must grow in storms and waves. We must temper ourselves in the great furnace of revolution. This time you came to Beijing, to the capital of the proletarian revolution, to the birthplace of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, enduring much hardship, unafraid of storms and rain. Your actions are correct! Your actions, your struggles, show that you have hope, that you can truly become good students of Chairman Mao, that you can become successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution. The hardships you endured this time show your heroic spirit, but this is only an initial test. You will still have to undergo countless tests, long-term tests. You must roll in the mud of the masses countless times, transforming yourselves into revolutionaries who strive for socialism and communism.

Revolution is not an easy task. To achieve revolutionary victory, we must overcome all obstacles and difficulties. Comrades must stand tall and firm, undergo countless trials, endure all hardships, and face all possible setbacks. You must go through all kinds of pain, through fierce conflicts between individualism and collectivism, communism. You must learn until old age, learn until death. Only then can we make necessary and possible contributions to our motherland and the cause of the proletarian revolution.

Comrades! Students! We must never forget our roots. We are all children of the people, raised with the blood and sweat of the working people! Never forget this. Always remember that the working people are our fathers and mothers. We must respectfully be the children of the people, the students of the people, forever with the masses, always thinking of the masses. Chairman Mao often says, we must never leave the masses. Only then can we know the masses, understand the masses, work with the masses, and truly serve the people.

Regarding the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, the Central Committee has made a decision. This is a great program for the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat personally formulated by our great leader and great helmsman Chairman Mao. Everyone must study it well, become familiar with it, master it, and apply it. Only then will we have the ideological weapons for struggle, to carry out this unprecedented cultural revolution, making this great revolution the driving force for all work, the driving force to catch up with and surpass the advanced levels of the world.

We wish you good health. This time you came to Beijing, I think, will leave a deep impression on you for life, will forever stir up revolutionary waves in your hearts, will forever encourage you to advance in storms and waves, will make our motherland, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, advance further under your generation—under the education of Chairman Mao—to push the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat forward, to make our motherland a model of the world's advanced level.

Revolution relies on itself, educates itself, and cannot be done for others. Please study the "Sixteen Points" well! Master this great spiritual weapon to carry out the struggle well. This is a summary of the struggle experience of the past two months, a summary made by Chairman Mao, not easily obtained, and must be studied well.

Long live our great leader and great helmsman Chairman Mao!

Long live the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat!

Long live the invincible great Mao Zedong Thought!

    在大风大浪里成长
    ——八月十六日在外地来京学生群众会上的讲话
    陈伯达同志们！同学们！
    大家全心全意，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为着我们无产阶级文化大革命这一个伟大的事业，为着我们亲爱的祖国，为着你们这一代同老一代的革命者能够衔接起来，在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下永远前进，为着把我们国家建成为一个伟大的社会主义国家，为着我们伟大的祖国永不变色，为着支持全世界一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族反对帝国主义及其走狗的革命斗争，你们在毛主席的号召下，要同资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的意识形态作斗争，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。你们来到伟大的首都北京，来到这个祖国的首都，来到祖国的革命中心，来到无产阶级革命的中心，我们衷心地欢迎你们。
    像我们的伟大领袖毛主席经常告诉我们的，一切革命者，一切革命青年，都应该经风雨，见世面。革命者不可能在温室里成长，而是要在大风大浪里成长。我们要在革命的大熔炉里锻炼自己。你们这次到北京来，到无产阶级革命的首都来，到无产阶级文化大革命的策源地来，经过很多辛苦，不怕大风大雨，你们的行动很对！！！你们的行动，你们的斗争，表现出你们有希望，你们能够真正做一个毛主席的好学生，能够做无产阶级革命事业的接班人。你们这次辛苦，表现你们的英雄气概，但是，这还是初步的考验，你们还要经过千百万次的考验，还要经过长期的考验。要在群众的泥巴里滚过千百万次，把自己变成为人民、为社会主义和共产主义奋斗的革命者。
    革命是件不容易的事，要取得革命胜利，必须战胜一切阻力，克服一切困难。同志们要顶天立地，经过千锤百炼，经得起一切折磨，经得起一切可能的意外的挫折。要经过各种各样痛苦，经过个人主义同集体主义、共产主义这样剧烈的冲突。要做到老，学到老，学到死。这样，我们才能对祖国，对无产阶级革命事业，做出自己必要的、可能的贡献。
    同志们！同学们！我们永远不要忘本。我们都是人民的儿子，都是劳动人民用血汗把我们养大的！千万不要忘记这点。千万要记得劳动人民是我们的父亲，是我们的母亲。我们要恭恭敬敬地做人民的儿子，做人民的学生，永远永远同人民群众在一起，时时刻刻都要想到人民群众。毛主席经常说，我们时刻都不要离开群众。这样，我们就可能知道群众，了解群众，同群众一道，也就可能好好为人民服务。
    关于无产阶级文化大革命，中央已经作了决定，这是我们伟大领袖，伟大舵手毛主席亲自主持制定的，是毛主席提出的无产阶级文化大革命的伟大纲领。大家要好好学习它，熟悉它，掌握它，运用它。这样，我们就有了斗争的思想武器，搞好这一场史无前例的文化大革命，使我们这一场大革命成为一切工作的伟大推动力，成为赶上和超过世界上一切先进水平的推动力。
    我们祝你们健康。你们这回到北京来，我想，将会在你们一生保存很深的印象，将会永远在你们的心中激起革命的波浪，将会永远鼓励你们在大风大浪中前进，将会使我们祖国在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下，由你们——毛主席教育下的新的一代，把无产阶级文化大革命推向前进，把我们祖国进一步变成为世界先进的模范。
    革命要依靠自己，自己教育自己，不能包办代替。请你们好好学习十六条！掌握这个伟大的精神武器，才能好好进行斗争。这是两个月来的斗争经验的总结，是毛主席做的总结，得之不易，一定要好好学习。
    我们伟大的领袖，伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    战无不胜的伟大毛泽东思想万岁！
                  （原载《红旗》杂志一九六六年第十一期）
