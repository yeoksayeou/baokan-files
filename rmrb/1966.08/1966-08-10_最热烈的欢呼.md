We most ardently and resolutely support the Party Central Committee's decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This wise decision by the Party Central Committee is a programmatic document of great historical significance. We must first thoroughly understand the spirit of this document and resolutely carry it out and implement it in our practical struggles.

We pledge to the Party: (1) To hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, and to guide our actions with Mao Zedong Thought at all times; (2) We will definitely unite with all revolutionary teachers, students, and staff under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly complete the revolutionary tasks of "one struggle, two criticisms, three reforms," and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    我们最热烈地最坚决地拥护党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定。党中央的这一英明决定，是具有伟大历史意义的纲领性文件。我们首先要认真领会这一文件的精神，并在实际斗争中坚决贯彻和执行。
    我们向党保证：（一）高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，时时事事用毛泽东思想指导自己的行动；（二）我们一定在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下，与一切革命师生员工团结起来，彻底完成“一斗、二批、三改”的革命任务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
