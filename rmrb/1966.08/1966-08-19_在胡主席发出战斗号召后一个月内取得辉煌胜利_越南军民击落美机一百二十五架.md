In the month following Chairman Hu's call to arms, a glorious victory has been achieved. Vietnamese military and civilians shoot down 125 American aircraft.

From Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 18th: Our reporter reports that from July 17th, when Chairman Ho Chi Minh issued his call to arms that shook the mountains and rivers, to August 17th, the heroic people of North Vietnam, in their brave struggle to shatter the American aggressors' serious "escalation" of the war, have achieved new and significant victories.

According to reports, during this period, the military and civilians of North Vietnam shot down 125 American aggressor aircraft and captured a large number of American pilots.

In this month, American air pirates continuously and madly bombed Hanoi and Haiphong, intensifying their bombing of economic facilities, residential areas, and water projects, committing heinous crimes. However, the American imperialists' plot of "bombing to force surrender" has once again failed. The Vietnamese people have shown through their actions that they will not yield. "Firmly carry out Chairman Hu's call to arms, annihilate the American aggressors" has become the battle oath of the entire army and people. They have launched an unprecedented wave of competitive fervor, once again shattering the myth of American imperialism's "air superiority." Now, the Vietnamese military and civilians, inspired by new battle victories, are fighting with even greater determination and unshakable confidence.

From Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 18th: It is reported here that in the afternoon of the 18th, a batch of American aggressor aircraft indiscriminately bombed a residential area in the eastern part of Yongfu Province, northwest of Hanoi. Local military and civilians bravely fought back, shooting down one American jet aircraft.

These aircraft were also hit by ground anti-aircraft fire when they intruded into Hanoi's airspace.

In addition, the military and civilians of Nghe An Province shot down one invading American aircraft on the morning of the 18th.

From Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 17th: The editorial of the Vietnamese "People's Army Newspaper" on the 16th condemned the new military adventures of American imperialism in the Vietnam War.

The article pointed out that the United States is sending its 4th Infantry Division and the 196th Infantry Brigade to South Vietnam and is about to send the 5th Marine Division, as well as the mercenary armies of South Korea and the Philippines, to South Vietnam. It has also increased the number of aircraft carriers in the Gulf of Tonkin and intensified the bombing and strafing of cities, residential areas, industrial zones, and dams in North Vietnam.

The article pointed out that American imperialism's new military adventures reflect its aggressive and extremely stubborn nature, proving that the passive predicament caused by the strategic contradictions of the American government has become extremely serious. The United States is making new struggles.

The article pointed out that no matter how many more troops the American imperialists send to South Vietnam, they cannot save themselves from even more disastrous defeats. The Vietnamese people are determined to fight until there is not a single American aggressor on Vietnamese soil.

　　在胡主席发出战斗号召后一个月内取得辉煌胜利
　　越南军民击落美机一百二十五架
    据新华社河内十八日电　本社记者报道：从胡志明主席七月十七日发出气壮山河的战斗号召到八月十七日的一个月里，英雄的越南北方军民在粉碎美国侵略者严重战争“升级”的英勇战斗中，取得了新的重大胜利。
    据公布，在这期间，越南北方军民共击落美国强盗飞机一百二十五架，活捉了一大批美国飞行员。
    在这一个月里，美国空中强盗连续疯狂地轰炸河内和海防，加紧轰炸经济设施、居民区和水利工程，犯下了滔天罪行。但是，美帝国主义这种“以炸迫和”的阴谋再次破产，越南人民用行动表示，他们决不屈服。“坚决实现胡主席号召，消灭美国侵略强盗”已经成为全军全民的战斗誓言。他们掀起了空前高涨的战斗竞赛热潮，又一次粉碎了美帝国主义所吹嘘的“空中优势”神话。现在，越南军民在新的战斗胜利鼓舞下斗志昂扬，以更加坚定的必胜信心投入战斗。
    新华社河内十八日电据这里公布：十八日下午，一批美国强盗飞机滥肆轰炸位于河内市西北的永福省东部一个居民区。当地军民英勇战斗，击落美国喷气式飞机一架。
    这批飞机在窜入河内上空时，又遭到地面防空部队的炮火轰击。
    此外，义安省军民十八日上午击落入侵的美国飞机一架。
    据新华社河内十七日电　越南《人民军队报》十六日发表评论员文章，谴责美帝国主义正在侵越战争中加紧进行新的军事冒险。
    文章指出，美国正在把它的第四步兵师和第一百九十六步兵旅派往南越，并且即将增派海军陆战队第五师以及南朝鲜和菲律宾帮凶军去南越。它还向北部湾增派航空母舰，增加了对越南北方城市、居民区、工业区和堤坝的轰炸和扫射。
    文章指出，美帝国主义新的军事冒险反映了它的侵略和极其顽固的本质，证明了美国政府由它的战略矛盾造成的被动困境已经变得极其严重。美国正在进行新的挣扎。
    文章指出，不论美帝国主义再向南越增派多少军队，也无法挽救它更为惨重的失败。越南人民决心打到在越南国土上没有一名美国侵略者为止。（附图片）
