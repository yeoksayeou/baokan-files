In the midst of the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, following the Seventh "Shanghai Spring" Music Festival, Heilongjiang Province held a grand Third "Harbin Summer" Music Festival. This was a music festival that held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. This was a music festival where the workers, peasants, and soldiers took to the stage of socialist literature and art, striking back against the revisionist literary and art black line and sweeping away the ghosts and monsters.

In this festival, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Heilongjiang Province, along with revolutionary literary and art workers, followed the direction of Chairman Mao's literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They created and performed truly revolutionary, national, and mass musical and dance performances and other forms of literary and art programs. With a magnificent revolutionary spirit and fervent political enthusiasm, they sang praises to our beloved leader Chairman Mao, sang praises to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, sang praises to the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party, sang praises to the great socialist motherland, sang praises to the great people's army, sang praises to the heroes armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and sang praises to the great achievements of the socialist revolution—the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The "Harbin Summer" Music Festival has infused new artistic life into the literary and art circles of Heilongjiang. The model workers, model community members, model soldiers, famous labor models, and educated youth who went to the countryside, they are not only active learners of Chairman Mao's works but also skilled performers of mass art. With a fearless heroic spirit, they broke free from the shackles of bourgeois "authorities," dared to establish something new for socialism, and stood out as creators of socialist new culture.

The success of this "Harbin Summer" Music Festival powerfully proves that the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are critics of the old world and creators of the new world. They can wield a hammer to work, a hoe and plow to farm, a gun to fight, and a pen to write. Armed with Mao Zedong Thought, they can take to the stage to sing, dance, and act, with the fighting posture of the revolutionary vanguard, occupying the cultural front of the proletariat.

To create socialist new culture, we must thoroughly criticize feudalism, capitalism, revisionism, and all reactionary old cultures. Chairman Mao said: "Without overthrowing these things, no new culture can be established. Without destruction, there can be no construction; without sweeping away, there can be no flow; without stopping, nothing can be done. The struggle between them is a struggle to the death." "Destruction" is criticism, is revolution. With destruction at the forefront and construction in the midst. In the literary and art circles, only by overthrowing, smashing, and exposing the evil influence of the literary and art black line represented by Zhou Yang, can we create a brand-new socialist culture. This "Harbin Summer" Music Festival, relying on the workers, peasants, and soldiers to carry forward the revolutionary and critical spirit of the proletariat, seized the stage of the "Harbin Summer" Music Festival that was once controlled by the literary and art black line. It sang a counter-song to the anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought music festival, and launched a great criticism, great demonstration, and great counterattack against the handful of black line gangsters.

Let us, under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take up the weapons of literature and art, sweep away all ghosts and monsters, cleanse all the old cultures of the exploiting classes, and create socialist new culture. Let us unswervingly carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

    涤荡旧文化　创造新文化
    ——祝一九六六年“哈尔滨之夏”音乐会胜利闭幕
    在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，继第七届“上海之春”音乐会之后，黑龙江省举行了规模盛大的第三届“哈尔滨之夏”音乐会。这是一次高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的音乐会。这是一次工农兵群众登上社会主义文艺舞台，反击修正主义文艺黑线、横扫牛鬼蛇神的音乐会。
    在这一届音乐会上，黑龙江省的广大工农兵群众和革命的文艺工作者，遵循着毛主席的文艺为工农兵服务的方向，创作和演出了真正革命化、民族化、群众化的音乐舞蹈和其他形式的文艺节目。他们用豪迈的革命精神、饱满的政治热情，歌颂我们敬爱的领袖毛主席，歌颂战无不胜的毛泽东思想，歌颂伟大、光荣、正确的共产党，歌颂伟大的社会主义祖国，歌颂伟大的人民军队，歌颂用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄人物，歌颂社会主义革命的伟大创举——无产阶级文化大革命。
    “哈尔滨之夏”音乐会，赋予黑龙江文艺界以新的艺术生命。五好职工、五好社员、五好战士、著名劳动模范、下乡知识青年，他们既是学习毛主席著作的积极分子，又是能歌善舞的群众艺术家，他们以大无畏的英雄气概，冲破资产阶级“权威”的束缚，敢于标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异，成了社会主义新文化的创造者。
    这一届“哈尔滨之夏”音乐会的成功，有力地证明用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大工农兵群众，是旧世界的批判者，是新世界的创造者。他们拿起锤子就能做工，拿起锄头犁耙就能种田，拿起枪杆子就能打仗，拿起笔杆子就能写文章。他们用毛泽东思想武装起来，就能登上舞台唱歌、跳舞、演戏，以革命主力军的战斗姿态，占领无产阶级文化阵地。
    要创造社会主义的新文化，必须大破封建主义、资本主义、修正主义和一切反动的旧文化。毛主席说：“不把这种东西打倒，什么新文化都是建立不起来的。不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行，它们之间的斗争是生死斗争。”“破”，就是批判，就是革命。破字当头，立在其中。在文艺界只有把以周扬为代表的文艺黑线斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，彻底肃清它的恶劣影响，才能创造崭新的社会主义文化。这一届“哈尔滨之夏”音乐会，依靠工农兵群众发扬无产阶级革命的、批判的精神，把过去为文艺黑线所把持的“哈尔滨之夏”音乐会的阵地夺过来。和反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的音乐会大唱对台戏，对那一小撮黑线黑帮人物进行大批判、大示威、大反击。
    让我们在毛泽东思想伟大红旗指引下，拿起文艺武器，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，涤荡一切剥削阶级的旧文化，创造社会主义的新文化，坚定不移地把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
