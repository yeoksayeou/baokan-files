	Standing Firm at the Signal Post
	Gédèfù, a Radar Soldier Awarded Third-Class Merit

	After a tense and fierce battle, the black dot representing the enemy's "Jiangjiang" finally disappeared from the radar screen. I was about to shout in triumph, but the voice from the headset said, "Immediately go to the command platform to replace the signalman." My heart sank: Could it be that something happened to the signalman, Xu Wenhua?

	I hurried out of the radar room and felt my way to the radio set. Xu Wenhua, wearing headphones and holding the microphone, was communicating with the higher-ups. I called out to him, but he didn't respond, probably because he was too busy. I didn't say much more and quickly returned to report to the commander: "The signal post is fine. Should I return to my original position?" The commander decisively ordered me to take over his job, saying, "Haven't you seen? The signalman is injured."

	I took over the signal post for the second time, knowing that he had been injured in the left arm and had it bandaged. I quickly took the microphone and headphones from him, saying, "You, injured and not saying a word. What are you doing sitting here? Go find a place without wind and waves to rest!"

	He sat motionless, nudging me with his leg, his voice soft but urgent, "Old buddy, you should go back to your original position. I can..."

	"What can you do? Look, that dark thing ahead is the 'Jianmen' we are pursuing. The battle is about to start, and communication is crucial at this time!" Fearing he wouldn't leave, I emphasized, "I am taking over your job as ordered by the higher-ups!"

	Finally, he reluctantly gave up his position, but he refused to go rest. I helped him to the side and said, "If you don't go down, just sit here and rest properly."

	The sky began to lighten, turning a dull gray. Our boat swiftly approached the enemy, following the "Sea Pioneer Boat." The enemy ship fired cannons in panic, trying to block our path. At this moment, the commander's voice came through the headset:

	"All boats must uphold our military tradition of not fearing fatigue and fighting continuously. Organize firepower and prepare for another battle! It's close combat, bayonets at the ready, and strike when close!"

	I quickly relayed the command to the boat's commander and was about to report back to the command boat when the microphone was suddenly snatched away by Xu Wenhua. I saw him shouting into the microphone, "This is Boat Two, Boat Two understood!" Then, holding the microphone with his right hand and lowering his left arm, he skillfully and swiftly relayed commands and reported situations, his voice firm and resonant, not at all like that of an injured person.

	I tried to persuade him and take the microphone back, but he pushed me away. He said, spiritually invigorated and firmly, "I can hold on. Persistence is victory!" Then, he urged me, "You go back to your position, or go to another position to participate in the battle!" I had no choice. With the higher-ups' approval, I could only assist him from the side and take care of him.

	The enemy's cannon fire became more intense, and water columns exploded beside the boat. We continued to charge at high speed. The atmosphere on the command platform was serious and tense, everyone holding their breath, waiting for the commander's firing order. Xu Wenhua was even more focused, carefully capturing every sound from the headset. Suddenly, Xu Wenhua shouted with all his might, "Fire!"

	With his shout, the boat shook violently, all cannons roaring, flames dancing, instantly suppressing the enemy's morale.

	The battle began, and communication became even more frequent and tense. Shells whistled, machines roared, and waves crashed, adding strong interference to the radio. But none of this phased Xu Wenhua. He sat firmly in front of the radio, his uninjured right hand tightly gripping the microphone, his firm and powerful voice clearly and loudly relaying the higher-ups' battle commands, the command boat's resolute will, and the determination to annihilate the enemy.

	Our boat, along with the others, under the commander's leadership, formed a steel fist, striking east and west as commanded. In just a few rounds, we turned this newly hatched "big-mouthed bird" from the United States into a wreck, sending it to the bottom of the sea to keep company with the "Jiangjiang."

	We bathed in the morning sun, returning in an orderly formation. At this moment, Xu Wenhua stood up, looked at the vast sea and sky, moved his right arm, and then looked at his hanging left arm, jokingly saying, "This battle let it rest well!" I also laughed, "Next time we fight, let it do more work."

    坚守在信号战位上
    荣立三等功的雷达兵　葛德富
    经过一阵紧张激烈的战斗，萤光屏上，敌“章江号”这个黑点终于被我们彻底“抹掉”了。我正想大声欢呼胜利，话筒里传来指挥员的声音：“立刻上指挥台接替信号员的工作。”我心里一沉：莫非信号员许文华发生了意外？
    我急忙跨出雷达室，摸到报话机跟前，许文华戴着耳机，紧握话筒，正在跟上级联络。我招呼他，他没回答，大概工作正忙。我没多说什么，急忙转回来向指挥员报告：“信号战位没有意外情况，我是否回原战位？”指挥员果断地命令我接替他的工作，说：“你没看见？信号员负伤了。”
    我第二次跨上信号战位，知道他左臂负伤并已包扎，忙伸手夺过话筒、耳机，说：“你呀，负了伤也不吭一声。坐在这儿干什么。快找个没有风、海水打不到的地方休息去！”他一动不动地坐着，用腿碰碰我，声音轻微而急切地说：“老伙计，你还是回原战位吧，我能……”
      “你能什么？你看，前面那黑呼呼的家伙，就是我们要追歼的‘剑门号’。战斗快要打响，这时候通讯联络多要紧！”怕他赖着不走，我又特别加重语气：“我接替你的工作，是上级的命令！”
    他终于无可奈何地把岗位让给我，但坚决不肯下去休息。我把他扶到一边，对他说：“你不下去也行，就老老实实坐在这儿休息吧。”
    东方透出一线曙光，天空变成灰蒙蒙的。我艇紧跟“海上先锋艇”疾速接敌。敌舰慌忙地打着炮，梦想阻拦我们。这时候，耳机里传来编队指挥员的命令：
  “各艇要发扬我军不怕疲劳连续作战的光荣传统，组织好火力，准备再战！还是近战，刺刀见红，逼近了再打！”我迅速将命令传达给艇首长以后，正要向指挥艇回话，话筒冷不防被许文华夺了过去，只见他嘴对话筒大声回答：“我是二号，二号明白！”接着，右手举着话筒，垂着左臂，熟练而迅速地传达命令、报告情况，声音坚定宏亮，一点不象个伤员的样子。
    我劝说他，夺他的话筒，都被他推开。他精神抖擞、一字一顿地说：“我能坚持，坚持就是胜利！”说完，反倒催我：“你回本战位去，要不，上别的战位参加战斗去吧！”我没办法。在上级同意下，只好在一旁协助他工作，顺便照顾他。
    敌舰炮火更加密集，舷旁炸起一根根水柱。我们艇继续高速冲击，指挥台上空气严肃紧张，人人屏声静息，等待编队首长的射击命令。许文华更是全神贯注，细心捕捉耳机里的每一个音响。突然，许文华使出全身力气，大吼一声：“射击！”
    随着他的喊声，刹时间天摇地动，全艇火炮一齐怒吼，炮口闪光，火龙飞舞，一下子就把敌人的气焰压下去了。
    战斗开始，通讯联络更加频繁紧张。炮弹呼啸，机器轰鸣，浪涛喧腾，给报话机增添强烈的干扰。可是这一切难不倒许文华，他端坐在报话机前，那只未负伤的右手紧握话筒，坚定有力的声音，把上级的战斗命令、指挥艇的坚定意志和歼敌决心，清楚宏亮、一字不漏地传到我们艇上。
    我们艇和其他艇在编队首长的指挥下，捏成一只钢铁的拳头，指东打东，指西打西。不到几个回合，又把这只刚从美国出笼的“巨嘴鸟”打得千疮百孔，碎片横飞，一眨眼沉入海底，跟“章江号”做伴去了。
    我们沐浴着朝阳，排着整齐的队形返航。这时候，许文华站起身，放眼看看辽阔的海空，活动了一下右臂，又望望下垂的左臂，自嘲地说：“这次战斗，可让它休息了个痛快！”我也笑呵呵地说：“下回打仗，再让它多干点。”
