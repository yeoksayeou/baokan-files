In last year's "August 6" naval battle, our People's Navy forces in the southeast coast fought a brilliant naval annihilation battle, successfully sinking the U.S.-made Kuomintang ships "Jianmen" and "Zhangjiang" that had been harassing our fishing grounds. In this battle, the iron soldier and combat hero, Mai Xiande, is particularly excited today. He expressed his determination to always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao.

Today, Mai Xiande got up early with boundless love for the Party and Chairman Mao, and boundless gratitude for the people of the entire nation. Facing the rising sun, he sang "The East Is Red" and returned to the ward to write with his right hand on the blackboard the seven large characters "First Anniversary of the August 6 Naval Battle," which he hung in his room. He also sat in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, studying Chairman Mao's quotations on class struggle and ideological cultivation word by word. When the responsible personnel of a certain naval unit in Guangzhou, Lian Guoqing and Li Jinglun, came to the hospital to visit him, he said emotionally, "Thank you for the leaders' care, thank you to the Party, and thank you to Chairman Mao." Lian Guoqing told him that U.S. imperialism was crazily bombing Hanoi and Haiphong in Vietnam, escalating the war in Vietnam. Upon hearing this, Mai Xiande was filled with class hatred and firmly said, "Resolutely annihilate U.S. imperialism. I have already applied three times to return to the battlefield. I want to fight!" Lian Guoqing and others also inquired about his study of Chairman Mao's works and his recovery of health. He said excitedly, "I will definitely read Chairman Mao's books over and over again, listen to Chairman Mao's words honestly, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions at all times. I will wholeheartedly be a good soldier of Chairman Mao."

    满怀激情纪念“八·六”海战胜利周年
    麦贤得表示永远做毛主席的好战士
    新华社广州六日电　在去年的“八·六”海战中，我人民海军部队在东南沿海打了一个漂亮的海上歼灭战，一举击沉了窜扰我渔场的美制蒋舰“剑门号”和“章江号”。在这次战斗中涌现出来的钢铁战士、战斗英雄麦贤得今天特别兴奋。他表示，一定要永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，做毛主席的好战士。
    今天，麦贤得一早起来怀着对党对毛主席无限热爱，对全国人民无限感激的心情，对着初升的太阳，高唱《东方红》，回到病房用右手在黑板上端端正正地写了“八·六海战一周年”七个大字，挂在房间里。并且坐在毛主席象前，一字一句地学习毛主席关于阶级斗争和思想意识修养的语录。当驻广州海军某机关负责人连国琦、李经伦等来到医院看望他时，他感动地说：“感谢首长的关怀，感谢党，感谢毛主席。”连国琦告诉他，美帝国主义疯狂轰炸越南的河内和海防，把侵越战争又升了一级。麦贤得听了满怀阶级仇恨，坚定地说：“坚决消灭美帝国主义。我已经三次申请重返战斗岗位了，我要打！”连国琦等还关心地问他学习毛主席著作的情形和身体恢复健康的情况，他激动地说：“我一定反反复复读毛主席的书，老老实实听毛主席的话，时时刻刻照毛主席的指示办事，一心一意做毛主席的好战士。”
