Chairman Mao says "It is reasonable to rebel," and we will definitely follow his instructions! Anything that does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, as long as it exists, we must rebel against it! We must criticize it, struggle against it, and overthrow it, then stomp on it with our feet. However, some agents of the bourgeoisie do not allow us to rebel, using all kinds of old forces and old orders to suppress, restrict, and harm us. We know that making revolution and rebelling against the reactionaries is a class struggle, and the enemy will inevitably oppose us. Chairman Mao has said, "Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing." The more the enemy opposes us, the more we must rebel. We must shout about rebelling, sing songs of rebellion, perform plays of rebellion, and spread the socialist wind and revolutionary fire everywhere, so that the whole world burns with the flames of rebellion, thoroughly overturning the old world and smashing it to pieces!

    造反有理
    毛主席说“造反有理”，我们坚决照办！一切不合毛泽东思想的东西，只要它存在，我们就要造它的反！就要批判它、斗争它，把它打翻在地，并且踏上一只脚。可是一些资产阶级的代理人却不准我们造反，利用种种旧势力，旧秩序，压制、限制、陷害我们。我们知道，干革命，造反动派的反是阶级斗争，敌人必然反对我们。毛主席说过“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”。敌人越反对，我们就越要造反。我们要喊造反，唱造反歌，演造反戏，到处煽社会主义之风，点革命之火，让全世界都烧起造反的烈火，把旧世界彻底打翻，砸它个稀巴烂！
