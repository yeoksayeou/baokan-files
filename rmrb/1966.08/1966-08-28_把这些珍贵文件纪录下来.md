The ongoing Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is developing deeply and widely. Many Red Guard organizations and Cultural Revolution Committees have printed and distributed leaflets, appeals, and other propaganda materials calling for the thorough destruction of old ideas, old culture, old customs, old habits, and some remnants of bourgeois right. These are precious documents of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

As a national library, we must be a school that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and actively propagates Mao Zedong Thought. We should also be an institution that collects various revolutionary documents. We hereby request that all Red Guard organizations and Cultural Revolution Committees, as well as other revolutionary organizations, send or deliver three copies of all issued and unissued "appeals" and all notices, propaganda materials, etc., to the "Beijing Library Revolutionary Documents Department" in a timely manner for study and reference.

    把这些珍贵文件纪录下来
    当前展开的无产阶级文化大革命，正在深入广泛地发展。很多红卫兵组织和文化革命委员会，印发了彻底摧毁旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯及一些资产阶级法权残余的传单、倡议书等宣传品，这是我们无产阶级文化大革命的珍贵文件。
    我们作为一个国家图书馆，必须是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极宣传毛泽东思想的社会主义学校，又应是收集各种革命文献的机构。我们特请各单位红卫兵组织和文化革命委员会等革命组织，将已发和未发的“倡议书”以及所有的布告、宣传品等，及时寄给或送交“北京图书馆革命文献部”三份，以备研究参考使用。
