Advanced units and individuals from various PLA units have been studying the public report of the 11th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party. Through their personal experiences of growing up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, they have gained a deeper understanding of this great truth: "Without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement." The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for the PLA's victory on the path of revolutionization.

These advanced units and individuals have, during the war years, followed the path indicated by Chairman Mao, fighting in various campaigns and achieving numerous victories. Some have actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing politics, and continuously creating "four-good" and "five-good" units, striding forward on the path of revolutionization. Others, in the class struggle to promote the proletariat and eliminate the bourgeoisie, have used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, firmly holding their rifles and wielding their pens, sweeping away all ghosts and monsters. Their common characteristic is that they have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and rapidly grown under its nurturing. During their study of the public report, they deeply felt that once the great Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it will become a powerful material force for transforming both the objective and subjective worlds. Many people said that Chairman Mao's theories on the contradictions, classes, and class struggles in socialist society are a new epoch-making development of Marxism-Leninism. Over the past few years, they have used Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful ideological weapon to observe, analyze, and transform everything, resolutely launching the struggle to promote the proletariat and eliminate the bourgeoisie, thereby greatly accelerating the process of ideological revolutionization.

The soldiers of the "Steel Eighth Company of the South China Frontier" in a unit of the Guangzhou Military Region deeply felt the significance of Chairman Mao's teaching to never forget class struggle during their serious study of the public report. The soldiers said, "We are facing the rotten capitalist world and are at the forefront of class struggle. The poisonous winds of the bourgeoisie are constantly attacking us, trying to make us degenerate and rot. However, we have stood firmly for over a decade. We can do this completely because of the great Mao Zedong Thought, taking class struggle as the key link, and firmly holding onto class education as our family treasure."

Many soldiers who have won honors in defending the country's territorial waters and airspace deeply felt during their study of the public report that studying Chairman Mao's theories on the contradictions, classes, and class struggles in socialist society has raised their class consciousness, making them feel a great power in their bodies during battles, daring to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire, daring to defeat any enemy. A soldier from a certain naval unit, Yuan Konghua, who won honors in the "August 6th" naval battle, said, "I joined the battle just a few months after boarding the ship. I deeply felt that the greatest preparedness is to arm oneself with Mao Zedong Thought. With Mao Zedong Thought, one can defeat all enemies."

The broad masses of soldiers unanimously expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life, forever being thorough revolutionaries of the proletariat.

　　解放军各部队先进单位和人物学习公报畅谈心得
　　毛泽东思想引导全军在革命化道路上胜利前进
　　决心跟着毛主席干一辈子革命，做无产阶级的彻底革命派
    据新华社十六日讯　中国人民解放军各部队的先进单位和先进人物，认真学习党的八届十一中全会公报。他们通过在毛泽东思想哺育下成长的亲身经历，更加深刻体会到这样一个伟大真理：“没有革命的理论，就不会有革命的运动”，战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是指引我军在革命化道路上胜利前进的根本保证。
    这些先进单位和先进人物，有的在战争年代就遵循毛主席所指引的道路，南征北战，屡建战功；有的是活学活用毛主席著作，突出政治，连创“四好”、“五好”，在革命化的道路上阔步前进；有的是在兴无灭资的阶级斗争中，以毛泽东思想为武器，握紧枪杆，拿起笔杆，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。他们的共同特点是，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在毛泽东思想哺育下迅速成长。他们在学习公报时，深刻地体会到，伟大的毛泽东思想一旦为群众所掌握，就会变成改造客观世界和主观世界的强大物质力量。许多人说，毛主席关于社会主义社会的矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争的理论，是马克思列宁主义的划时代的新发展。几年来，他们用毛泽东思想这一强大的思想武器，观察一切，分析一切，改造一切，坚决展开兴无灭资的斗争，从而大大加速了思想革命化的进程。
    广州部队某部“南海前哨钢八连”的指战员们，在认真学习公报时，对毛主席千万不要忘记阶级斗争的教导，体会更加深刻。指战员们说，我们面对着糜烂的资本主义世界，处在阶级斗争的最前哨，资产阶级的妖风臭气不时在疯狂地向我们进攻，妄想要我们变质腐烂。可是我们十多年来，始终巍然屹立。我们能够这样，完全是靠伟大的毛泽东思想，以阶级斗争为纲，紧紧抓住阶级教育这个传家宝。
    不少在保卫祖国领海、领空战斗中荣立战功的指战员们，在学习公报时，还深深体会到，学了毛主席关于社会主义社会的矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争理论，提高了阶级觉悟，在战斗中浑身就会产生巨大的力量，刀山敢上，火海敢闯，什么敌人都敢把它压倒、砸烂。在“八·六”海战中荣立战功的海军某部邝孔华说，我上艇几个月就参加了“八·六”海战。我深深体会到，最大的战备就是用毛泽东思想武装自己头脑。有了毛泽东思想，就能战胜一切敌人。
    广大指战员一致表示，要跟着毛主席干一辈子革命，永远做无产阶级的彻底革命派。
