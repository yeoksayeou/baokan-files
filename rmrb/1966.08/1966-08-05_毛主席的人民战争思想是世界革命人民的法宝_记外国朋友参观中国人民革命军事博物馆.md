Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army have, through long, arduous, tortuous, and complex revolutionary struggles, defeated powerful domestic and foreign enemies and established a great socialist new China. The victory of the Chinese revolution is the victory of great Mao Zedong Thought.

The Chinese People's Revolution Military Museum is an important bastion for propagating great Mao Zedong Thought. The tens of thousands of revolutionary relics on display vividly depict the glorious fighting journey and great victories achieved by the Chinese people and army, armed with Chairman Mao's great thought on people's war, under the wise leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong. Over the past few years, more than 30,000 foreign friends from over 140 countries and regions across five continents, especially the messengers of revolutionary people from Asia, Africa, and Latin America, have come here to visit. With the most fervent revolutionary sentiments to learn from the great Mao Zedong Thought and the armed struggle experience of the Chinese people's revolution, they expressed their utmost respect and sincerity, declaring their boundless love for Chairman Mao and their unshakable faith in the great Mao Zedong Thought.

The people of the world love Chairman Mao dearly. Mao Zedong Thought is the red sun in the hearts of revolutionary people.

A revolutionary leader from South Africa, brimming with enthusiasm, visited here for two consecutive days. He expressed his deep admiration, saying, "The great victory of the Chinese revolution is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. As a correct leader, one must be able to make decisions on crucial issues that determine the success or failure of the revolution in various stages of its development and in extremely complex situations, without being either 'leftist' or 'rightist.' This is not easy to achieve, but Chairman Mao has done it. Countless facts prove that Comrade Mao Zedong is the most correct and greatest revolutionary leader." Twenty-plus friends from Palestine, after visiting, said with full confidence, "The victory of the Chinese revolution proves that Chairman Mao is absolutely correct. When we return, we will definitely carry out the revolution according to Chairman Mao's words." A friend from Thailand said, "Chairman Mao's works are a vast treasure trove of proletarian revolutionary theory. I feel that studying Chairman Mao's works is not a matter of a few hours or days, but a lifelong endeavor requiring all one's energy." A friend from Congo (Leopoldville) said, "Our revolutionary leaders introduced to us the experiences of China. He told us that the only way to liberate Congo (Leopoldville) is through armed struggle. In practice, we further realized that Mao Zedong Thought is absolutely correct. Chairman Mao's works play a very important role in our revolutionary struggle." Heroes from South Vietnam, during their visit, said, "Comrade Mao Zedong creatively developed Marxism-Leninism and made great contributions to the proletarian revolutionary cause. Chairman Mao's military thought is the most correct truth for the proletariat and oppressed peoples and nations in their struggle for liberation. Chairman Mao's thought on people's war is the magic weapon for the revolutionary people of the world to defeat the enemy. With Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutions of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America can avoid detours. Although each country's situation is different, as long as Mao Zedong Thought is followed, all difficulties can be overcome, and any enemy can be defeated." Members of the Angolan Trade Union delegation, with tears of gratitude, told the guide, "We have learned the most precious revolutionary struggle experience of the Chinese people. What I want to express to you is that when we return, we will definitely fight for the independence and liberation of our country according to Chairman Mao's teachings." An African woman, after visiting, passionately told the guide, "Now, more and more Africans want to come to China to learn revolutionary experience. This is because: Beijing is the lighthouse of world revolution, and Mao Zedong Thought is the red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world."

Foreign friends said: Mao Zedong is the hope of the world's people. Our heartfelt love for Chairman Mao is indescribable.

Many foreign friends, after visiting, expressed their deep admiration for Comrade Mao Zedong's most resolute and thorough proletarian revolutionary spirit and his most flexible and ingenious art of struggle. A comrade from Vietnam, from the frontline of the anti-American struggle, upon hearing the guide's introduction to Chairman Mao's statement, "Struggle, fail, struggle again, fail again, struggle again until victory—that is the logic of the people," excitedly said, "Yes, we are learning from Chairman Mao's spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, resolutely fighting against American imperialism. Some people do not allow us to revolutionize, but we do not listen to them. We will fight to the end and definitely achieve the final victory." A friend from Thailand, after visiting, said, "In the early stages of the liberation war, the enemy had absolute superiority in numbers and equipment, and the situation was very serious. At this critical moment, Chairman Mao, with his spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, armed the entire military and people, pointing out that this enemy must be defeated and can be defeated. History has indeed developed exactly as Chairman Mao predicted." Many foreign friends highly praised Chairman Mao's brilliant judgment that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. They said: This is not only a powerful ideological weapon for the Chinese people to achieve revolutionary victory but also a powerful ideological weapon for the revolutionary people of the world to achieve victory; it greatly boosted the confidence of millions of people in fighting against seemingly powerful enemies. A Vietnamese comrade, from his personal experience, concluded, "American imperialism is indeed a paper tiger that is strong on the outside but weak on the inside. If you fear it, it will be fierce; if you do not fear it and resolutely fight it, it will fear you. The United States has made a fool of itself in Vietnam, which is another big exposure of its paper tiger nature." A Congolese (Brazzaville) writer attending the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers, after learning about the facts that the Chinese people's army annihilated more than eight million troops of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits supported by American imperialism and that the Chinese People's Volunteers exposed the American imperialist paper tiger during the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, said with unwavering confidence, "Chairman Mao's brilliant judgment greatly boosted our courage to fight against American imperialism and its running dogs. When we return, we will definitely fight to the end with American imperialism. Victory will surely be ours." Members of the Women's Delegation from Portuguese Guinea said, "For revolutionaries, we must arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought. We learn from Mao Zedong's spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, strategically despising the enemy and tactically taking the enemy seriously, which means being brave, tenacious, fearless of hardships and sacrifices, and resolutely making revolution. We firmly believe that one day, the pirate flag of imperialism will be lowered in our country, and our revolutionary flag will fly high in the sky of our motherland."

The road of surrounding the cities from the countryside and finally seizing the cities is the inevitable path for the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries to seek liberation.

The road that Chairman Mao found for the Chinese revolution, relying on the peasants, establishing rural revolutionary base areas, surrounding the cities from the countryside and finally seizing the cities, and combining armed struggle as the main form, land revolution as the main content, and base area construction as the support, has been recognized and applied by more and more revolutionary friends worldwide. Many foreign friends who have visited the military museum said: The road that Chairman Mao found is the inevitable path for the oppressed nations and peoples of colonial and semi-colonial countries to seek liberation and is also the inevitable path to finally bury imperialism. Therefore, many foreign friends, during their visits, requested to focus on learning these issues. A friend from Latin America, after visiting, said, "To achieve revolutionary victory, one must take the road of surrounding the cities from the countryside and finally seizing the cities. The extremely rich armed struggle experience created by the Chinese people under the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao is a very precious spiritual wealth, guiding the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world." A Colombian peasant movement leader, after visiting, deeply felt, "Peasants played a significant role in the Chinese revolution. Our country is the same; peasants make up the majority. The reactionary army cannot leave the cities; once they enter the countryside, they are passive everywhere and get beaten by the guerrillas everywhere. Chairman Mao's thought of surrounding the cities from the countryside and finally seizing them is extremely correct and great." A Japanese friend said, "The current world revolution is advancing along the path indicated by Chairman Mao, forming a favorable situation of surrounding the cities from the countryside. The revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and take the road of armed struggle to surround the cities from the countryside and finally seize them to achieve the ultimate victory."

"The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, solving problems through war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally correct, whether in China or abroad, it is universally correct." Chairman Mao's brilliant thought has also been agreed upon and accepted by more and more foreign friends. They said: This is the truth of revolution, this is the law of revolution. A friend from Malawi, after visiting, shared his thoughts, saying, "I firmly do not believe in the fallacy of 'peaceful transition.' A basic principle of revolution is to carry out armed struggle. If there is no armed struggle, the revolution will be paralyzed. It is also unthinkable that true political independence can be achieved without a bloody struggle." A friend from Cameroon said, "Mao Zedong Thought has become the guiding light for the world revolution. The road of Mao Zedong is the road for the revolutionary people of the world to seek liberation; the road of Mao Zedong is the road to victory."

A people's army without a people has nothing. Chairman Mao's teaching is a universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, which is being recognized and grasped by more and more revolutionary people. A leader of armed struggle from Congo (Leopoldville), after visiting, deeply felt, saying, "We must establish a revolutionary armed force, definitely. Mao Zedong is a great leader. Having such a great leader is the happiness of the Chinese people and the Chinese people's army." Many foreign friends highly praised Chairman Mao's series of military principles. Friends from Southeast Asia said: From the Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention issued during the time of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, it can be seen that your army is a disciplined army, a true people's army. A friend from Mali said, "Your army is under the absolute leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, a true people's army serving the people, placing itself among the masses and helping the masses produce, thus gaining the complete support of the masses, so it is an invincible army."

Many foreign friends deeply felt that the people's army fights not merely by relying on weapons and technology but more importantly on politics, the proletarian revolutionary consciousness and bravery of the soldiers and officers, and the support of the people. A Vietnamese comrade, after visiting, said, "I completely agree with Chairman Mao's statement that weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor; the decisive factor is people, not things. Modern revisionists do not see it this way; they say American imperialism has nuclear teeth. We, the people of South Vietnam, are now using bamboo stakes to deal with American invaders, making them desperate. This shows that we have used bamboo stakes to expose the American imperialist paper tiger with 'nuclear teeth.' Our victory once again proves: The power of people's war is invincible in the world."

Many foreign guests, after visiting, reached a common conclusion: The seven hundred million Chinese people and army armed with Mao Zedong Thought are invincible. If American imperialism dares to launch an aggressive war against China, it will come in but not be able to get out, and will be submerged in the vast ocean of people's war. A French friend expressed, "In China, I have seen with my own eyes that the Chinese people love peace and resolutely oppose American imperialism's policy of aggression and war. China practices people's war. If American imperialism dares to invade you, it will have no good outcome." Members of the Albanian Dinamo Football Team, when visiting the wreckage of a U-2 type high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft and an unmanned high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft made in the U.S. shot down by our army, immediately responded when the guide said in a loud voice, "Let imperialism and all reactionaries come! They will be submerged in the vast ocean of people's war!" The team leader, N. Takë, immediately added, "Let the revisionists come too! They are doomed to fail and will not gain any advantage." They also wrote in the guestbook, "The Chinese People's Liberation Army is powerful, invincible, and always victorious."

Many foreign friends highly evaluated the entire set of strategies and tactics of people's war formulated by Chairman Mao for our army, which they said is the magic weapon for the revolutionary people of the world to defeat the enemy. A friend from Oman said, "The strategies and tactics of proletarian revolution proposed by Marx and Lenin for revolutionaries have now been creatively developed by Chairman Mao, greatly enriching the treasure trove of Marxism-Leninism." An Indonesian friend said, "Chairman Mao is a brilliant military commander who is good at seeing the whole picture of the war and mastering the entire law of war, so he can hold the power of certain victory." A friend from Argentina said, "Chairman Mao's strategic and tactical thoughts on guerrilla warfare are the fundamental guarantee for the weak to defeat the strong; it is the fundamental guarantee for the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to carry out armed struggle and achieve victory in revolutionary war."

A hero from South Vietnam who fought against the "tigers" said, "The strategies and tactics of people's war created by Comrade Mao Zedong have been fully applied in our country. We learned Chairman Mao's 'ten-character formula for guerrilla warfare' in 1944: 'The enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy halts, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue.' Not only did we use it in the past, but we also use it now; not only in the countryside but also in the cities; to attack the enemy's small strongholds and to destroy the enemy's large airports." After the visit, the hosts and guests had a lively discussion, agreeing that by using the entire set of methods created by Chairman Mao, "You fight yours, I fight mine; if we can win, we fight; if we can't win, we retreat." In this way, using our strengths to attack the enemy's weaknesses, fighting battle by battle, and biting piece by piece, we can ultimately completely defeat the American invaders.

Foreign friends were deeply moved by the fact that the Chinese people, following Chairman Mao's teachings, wholeheartedly support the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries, and highly praised the great internationalist spirit of the Chinese people. The deputy leader of the Lao Patriotic Front Art Troupe, Batsé Xīshālóng, said, "The revolutionary people of the world support each other, but the Chinese people's support for the people of the world is the greatest." Some Lao friends also said, "China sincerely supports the revolutions of all countries. But the revisionists not only do not support us but also sabotage our revolution." Many Vietnamese comrades from the frontline of the anti-American struggle highly evaluated the selfless aid provided by the Chinese people to the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation. They said: The Chinese people have provided selfless aid to the Vietnamese and revolutionary people of the world. Every victory we achieve in our struggle against American aggression for national salvation is inseparable from China's aid. In our struggle against American aggression for national salvation, with the generous and selfless aid of the Chinese people, no matter how crazily the American imperialists escalate the war, we will fight to the end and definitely defeat it, driving the American imperialists out of Vietnam! A representative from Basutoland attending the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers, after visiting, said, "Chairman Mao is the great leader of the revolutionary people of the world. With Mao Zedong Thought, with the brilliant example of the Chinese revolution, and with the Chinese people's firm opposition to imperialism and support for the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries, the national liberation struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America have hope and reliance." Two French friends, after visiting, said, "You have achieved a great victory through long-term revolutionary struggles. But after your victory, you did not live a life of ease because of the past hardships; instead, you selflessly aid the just struggles of the oppressed people of the world with all your strength. You are true Marxist-Leninists." Many foreign friends emphasized, "You teach us Mao Zedong Thought, which is more important than any material aid. This is the greatest aid to us."

"Waves surge and clouds rage across the four seas, winds howl and thunder roars across the five continents." In today's world, where the great revolutionary storm of the people of the world against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries is more widespread and profound, studying Mao Zedong Thought, applying Mao Zedong Thought, propagating Mao Zedong Thought, and defending Mao Zedong Thought is not only the glorious mission of the Chinese people but has become the common cause of all revolutionary people of the world. We firmly believe that the revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought will ultimately smash all the heavy shackles on their backs, destroy the old world, and build a new world without imperialism, capitalism, and exploitation.

Victory belongs to all the revolutionary people of the world armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought!

    毛主席的人民战争思想是世界革命人民的法宝
    ——记外国朋友参观中国人民革命军事博物馆
    中国人民和中国人民军队在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的英明领导下，经过长期、艰苦、曲折、复杂的革命斗争，战胜了国内外强大敌人，建立了伟大的社会主义的新中国。中国革命的胜利，是伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利。
    中国人民革命军事博物馆，是宣传伟大的毛泽东思想的一个重要阵地。馆内陈列的几万件革命文物，生动形象地表现了用毛主席的伟大的人民战争思想武装起来的中国人民和军队，在毛泽东同志的英明领导下所走过的光辉战斗历程和取得伟大胜利的革命史实。几年来，来自各大洲一百四十多个国家和地区的三万多名外国朋友，特别是来自亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的革命人民的使者，他们怀着学习伟大的毛泽东思想和中国人民革命武装斗争经验的最炽热的革命情感，先后来这里参观。在参观过程中，他们以最崇敬的心情、最真诚的语言，表达了全世界革命人民对毛主席的无限热爱和对伟大的毛泽东思想的无限信仰。
    全世界人民无限热爱毛主席  毛泽东思想是革命人民心中的红太阳
    一位来自南非的革命领导人，热情洋溢地在这里连续参观了两天，他无限敬佩地说：“中国革命的伟大胜利，就是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。作为一个正确的领导者，必须是在革命处于各个不同的发展阶段和极其复杂的情况下，对革命成败攸关的重大问题作出决定时，能够作到既不‘左’，也不右，然而这是不容易做到的，但是毛主席都做到了。无数事实证明，毛泽东同志是最正确、最伟大的革命领袖。”二十几位巴勒斯坦的朋友参观后满怀信心地说：“中国革命的胜利，证明了毛主席是非常正确的。我们回去以后，一定按照毛主席的话去进行革命斗争。”一位泰国朋友说：“毛主席的著作是一座巨大的无产阶级革命理论宝库，我感到学习毛主席著作，不是几个小时、几天的事情，而是要用自己的一生的全部精力。”刚果（利）的一位朋友说：“我们的革命领导人向我们介绍了中国的经验，他告诉我们，解放刚果（利）的唯一道路，就是武装斗争的道路。在实践中，我们更进一步认识到毛泽东思想是非常正确的。毛主席著作对我们的革命斗争起着非常重要的作用。”来自越南南方的英雄们，在参观时说：“毛泽东同志创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，对无产阶级革命事业作出了伟大贡献。毛主席的军事思想，是无产阶级和被压迫人民被压迫民族争取解放的最正确的真理。毛主席的人民战争思想，是世界革命人民战胜敌人的法宝。有了毛泽东思想，亚非拉人民的革命，就可以少走弯路。尽管每个国家的情况不同，但是，只要有了毛泽东思想作指导，就能克服各种困难，战胜任何敌人。”安哥拉工会代表团的朋友们参观后，含着感激的眼泪向解说员说：“我们学习了中国人民最宝贵的革命斗争经验，我要向你们表达的就是：回去以后，一定按照毛主席的教导，为我国的独立解放而斗争。”一位非洲妇女参观以后，满怀激情地对解说员说：“现在，越来越多的非洲人要到中国来学习革命经验。这是因为：北京是世界革命的灯塔，毛泽东思想是世界革命人民心中的红太阳。”
    外国朋友们说：毛泽东是世界人民的希望，我们对毛主席出自内心的无限热爱，是难以用语言表达的。
    毛主席敢于斗争敢于胜利的彻底革命精神，鼓舞世界人民起来闹革命
    许多外国朋友参观后，对于毛泽东同志最坚定、最彻底的无产阶级革命精神，和最灵活、最巧妙的斗争艺术，表示万分敬佩。来自抗美斗争最前线的一位越南同志，听了解说员介绍毛主席关于“斗争，失败，再斗争，再失败，再斗争，直至胜利——这就是人民的逻辑”的论述，激动地说：“是的，我们就是学习毛主席这种敢于斗争、敢于胜利的彻底革命精神，坚决同美帝国主义展开斗争。有些人不让我们革命，我们不听他们的。我们斗争到底，一定能够取得最后胜利。”泰国朋友参观后说：“中国在解放战争初期，敌军在数量上和装备上占绝对优势，形势是很严重的。在这个关键时刻，毛主席以敢于斗争、敢于胜利的彻底革命精神，武装了全体军民，指明必须打败这个敌人，而且能够打败它，历史正是完全按照毛主席的预言发展的。”许多外国朋友高度赞扬毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断。他们说：这不仅是中国人民取得革命胜利的强大思想武器，也是全世界革命人民争取胜利的强大思想武器；它大大鼓舞了千百万人民同貌似强大的敌人进行斗争的胜利信心。前来参观的越南同志从自己的亲身经历中得出结论说：“美帝国主义的确是外强中干的纸老虎。你怕它，它就凶，你不怕它，坚决和它斗，它就怕你。美国在越南出尽了洋相，正是它的纸老虎原形的又一次大暴露。”出席亚非作家紧急会议的刚果（布）作家在军事博物馆参观中，了解到中国人民军队消灭了在美帝国主义支持下的蒋介石匪帮八百多万军队和中国人民志愿军在抗美援朝战争中戳穿了美帝纸老虎的史实以后，信心百倍地说：“毛主席这一英明论断极大地鼓舞了我们同美帝国主义及其走狗进行斗争的勇气。我们回去之后，决心与美帝国主义斗争到底，胜利一定是我们的。”葡属几内亚妇女代表团的朋友们参观后说：“对革命者来说，都要用毛泽东思想武装自己。我们学习毛泽东的敢于斗争、敢于胜利的思想，从战略上藐视敌人，从战术上重视敌人，就是要勇敢，顽强，不怕艰难困苦，不怕流血牺牲，坚决闹革命。我们坚信，总会有一天，帝国主义的强盗旗帜会在我们国家降下来，我们的革命的旗帜会在祖国的天空迎风飘扬。”
    以农村包围城市最后夺取城市的道路是殖民地半殖民地人民求解放的必由之路
    毛主席为中国革命找到的依靠农民，建立农村革命根据地，以农村包围城市、最后夺取城市的道路，和以武装斗争为主要形式、以土地革命为主要内容、以根据地建设为依托的三者相结合的工农武装割据思想，已被全世界越来越多的革命朋友所认识和运用。参观过军事博物馆的许多外国朋友说：毛主席找到的这条道路，是殖民地、半殖民地被压迫民族、被压迫人民求解放的必由之路，也是最后埋葬帝国主义的必由之路。因此，许多外国朋友在参观时，要求重点学习这些问题。拉丁美洲一位朋友参观后说：“要取得革命的胜利，就要走以农村包围城市、最后夺取城市的道路。中国人民在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，创造的极其丰富的武装斗争经验，是极为宝贵的精神财富，它正在指导着全世界人民的革命斗争。”哥伦比亚一位农民运动负责人参观后，深有所感，他说：“农民在中国的革命中起了很大作用。我们国家也是一样，农民占大多数。反动军队离不开城市，他们一到农村，就处处被动，处处挨游击队的打。毛主席的农村包围城市并最后夺取城市的思想，非常正确，非常伟大。”一位日本朋友说：“当前世界革命正在沿着毛主席指引的道路前进，形成了以农村包围城市的大好形势。亚非拉人民的革命斗争，必须按照毛主席的教导，采取以农村包围城市最后夺取城市的武装斗争的道路，才能取得最后的胜利。”
    “革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。”毛主席的这一光辉思想，也为越来越多的外国朋友所赞同，所接受。他们说：这是革命的真理，这是革命的规律。马拉维的朋友参观后发表感想说：“我是坚决不相信‘和平过渡’的谬论的。革命的一条基本原则，就是进行武装斗争，如果没有武装斗争，这个革命就要瘫痪。也不能设想，不经过流血的斗争就可以取得真正的政治独立。”一位喀麦隆的朋友说：“毛泽东思想已经成为指导世界革命的明灯。毛泽东的道路，就是世界革命人民求解放的道路；毛泽东的道路，就是胜利的道路。”
  毛泽东思想武装起来的人民军队是无敌的
      “没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”毛主席的这一教导，是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，它正在被越来越多的革命人民所认识和掌握。刚果（利）一位武装斗争的领导人参观以后，深有感受地说：“我们必须建立革命的武装，一定要建立。毛泽东是伟大的领袖，有这样伟大的领袖是中国人民和中国人民军队的幸福。”许多外国朋友对毛主席的一系列的建军原则，表示极为赞扬和敬佩。东南亚的一些朋友说：从工农红军时颁布的三大纪律、八项注意中就可以看出，你们的军队，是一支有严格纪律的军队，是一支真正的人民军队。马里朋友说：“你们的军队是在中国共产党绝对领导之下的，是真正为人民服务的军队，它把自己置于群众之中，并帮助群众生产，得到了群众的完全支持，所以是一支战无不胜的军队。”
    许多外国朋友对于人民军队打仗不是单纯地凭武器和技术，而更重要的是凭政治，凭指战员的无产阶级革命觉悟和勇敢精神，凭人民群众的拥护和支持，深有感受。一位越南同志参观后说：“我完全同意毛主席说的，武器是战争的重要因素，但不是决定因素，决定因素是人不是物。现代修正主义者就不是这样看的，他们说美帝国主义有核牙齿。我们越南南方人民现在用竹尖桩对付美国侵略者，打得他们走投无路，这说明我们用竹尖桩戳穿了有‘核牙齿’的美帝纸老虎。我们的胜利，再次证明：人民战争威力无敌于天下。”
    许多外宾参观后得出一个共同的结论，用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民和军队是不可战胜的。美帝国主义胆敢对中国发动侵略战争，它就进得来，出不去，就会被淹没在人民战争的汪洋大海之中。一位法国朋友表示：“在中国，我亲眼看到中国人民热爱和平，坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策。中国实行人民战争，美帝国主义胆敢侵略你们，它是没有好下场的。”阿尔巴尼亚狄纳莫足球队队员在参观被我军击落的美制U—2型高空侦察机和美制无人驾驶高空侦察机的残骸时，当解说员用宏亮的声音说道：“让帝国主义和一切反动派都来吧！来了就陷入人民战争的汪洋大海！”领队内·塔凯立即接过话来说：“让修正主义者也一齐来吧！它们注定要失败的，决不会得到什么便宜。”他们还在留言簿上写道：“中国人民解放军是强大的，是永远不可战胜的，永远是胜利者。”
    毛主席关于人民战争的战略战术是世界革命人民克敌制胜的法宝
    许多外国朋友高度评价毛主席为我军制定的一整套以我之长攻敌之短的人民战争的战略战术。他们说：这是世界革命人民克敌制胜的法宝。阿曼一位朋友说：“马克思、列宁为革命者提出的无产阶级革命的战略战术，现在已由毛主席天才地创造性地发展了，极大地充实了马克思列宁主义的宝库”。印度尼西亚一位朋友说：“毛主席是一位天才的军事统帅，他善于从战争全局着眼，驾驭整个战争的规律，所以能操必胜之权”。来自阿根廷的朋友说：“毛主席关于游击战争的战略战术思想，是弱军战胜强敌的根本保证；是亚非拉人民进行武装斗争，取得革命战争胜利的根本保证。”
    来自越南南方的打“虎”英雄说：“毛泽东同志创造的人民战争的战略战术，在我们那里得到了充分的运用。我们在一九四四年就学习了毛主席的‘敌进我退，敌驻我扰，敌疲我打，敌退我追’的游击战十六字诀。不仅过去用，现在也用；不仅在农村用，在城市也用；打敌人的小据点用，干敌人大的飞机场也用。”参观后宾主们互相畅谈，认为运用毛主席创造的人民战争的一整套办法，“你打你的，我打我的；打得赢就打，打不赢就走。”这样，以我之长，攻敌之短，一仗一仗地打，一口一口地吃，就能最后彻底吃掉美国侵略者。
    毛泽东思想是对世界革命人民的最大援助
    外国朋友对中国人民遵照毛主席的教导，全力支援世界各国人民的革命斗争，非常感动，高度赞扬中国人民伟大的国际主义精神。老挝爱国战线党文工团副团长巴色·西沙隆说：“世界革命人民是相互支援的，但中国人民对世界人民的支援最大。”有的老挝朋友还说：“中国对世界各国的革命都给予真诚的支援。而修正主义者不但不支持我们，反而破坏我们的革命。”来自抗美斗争最前线的许多越南同志，高度评价中国人民给予越南人民抗美救国斗争的无私援助。他们说：中国人民给予了越南和全世界革命人民以无私的援助。我们越南抗美救国斗争取得的每一个胜利，都是和中国的援助分不开的。在我们的抗美救国斗争中，有了中国人民的慷慨无私的援助，不管美帝国主义疯狂地把战争“升级”到那一步，我们都要打到底，一定能够打败它，直到把美帝国主义赶出越南去！参加亚非作家紧急会议的巴苏陀兰代表参观后说：“毛主席是世界革命人民的伟大领袖，我们有了毛泽东思想，有了中国革命的光辉榜样，有了中国人民坚定地反对帝国主义、支持世界各国人民的革命斗争，我们亚非拉人民的民族解放斗争，就有了依靠和希望。”两位法国朋友参观后说：“你们经过长期的革命斗争，取得了史诗般的伟大胜利。但是，你们在胜利以后，并没有因为过去那么艰苦而去过自己的安逸生活；相反，你们以最大的力量无私地援助全世界被压迫人民的正义斗争。你们是真正的马克思列宁主义者。”许多外国朋友强调说：你们给我们讲毛泽东思想，比什么物资都重要，这是给我们的最大的援助。
      “四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震?风雷激。”在全世界革命人民反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义和反对各国反动派的伟大革命风暴更加广泛、更加深入发展的今天，学习毛泽东思想，运用毛泽东思想，宣传毛泽东思想，捍卫毛泽东思想，不仅是中国人民的光荣任务，它已经变成了全世界一切革命人民的共同事业。我们坚信，用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民，最后必将彻底砸碎压在他们身上的各种沉重的枷锁，打碎旧世界，建立一个没有帝国主义，没有资本主义，没有剥削制度的新世界。
    胜利属于用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的全世界一切革命的人民！
