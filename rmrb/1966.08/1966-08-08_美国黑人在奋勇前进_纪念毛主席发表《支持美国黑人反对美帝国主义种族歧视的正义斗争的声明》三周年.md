Today marks the third anniversary of Chairman Mao Zedong's statement "Support the Just Struggle of the American Blacks Against Racial Discrimination by American Imperialism." People from all walks of life in the capital will hold a rally to oppose American imperialism and support the struggle of African Americans against racial discrimination. The 700 million people of China will forever stand with the African Americans and the American people, joining them in opposing the common enemy of all peoples of the world, American imperialism, and resolutely supporting their just struggle.

Three years ago, Chairman Mao correctly pointed out: "National struggle, in the final analysis, is a class struggle." This incisive Marxist analysis and judgment pointed out the direction and path for African Americans to strive for liberation. Chairman Mao's statement greatly boosted the fighting spirit and confidence in victory of African Americans, inspiring the revolutionary struggles of all oppressed peoples and nations around the world.

Over the past three years, the struggle of African Americans against racial discrimination and for freedom and equality has made significant progress. A prominent feature is that the African American masses have increasingly launched violent self-defense struggles, bravely using revolutionary violence to counter revolutionary violence. The bloody suppression of the African American struggle by the Johnson administration has made more and more black masses see through the political deception of the American ruling class, discard illusions, and take up the fight. They have found the correct path of relying on violence to struggle for their own freedom and liberation in their revolutionary practice. This is a sign of unprecedented awakening among African Americans.

Recently, in their anti-violence struggle, African Americans have raised the slogan "Black Power," which is another important development in the African American struggle. In a class society, there is only ruthless class oppression, not equal rights. To think that the heartless bosses on Wall Street will have a change of heart and grant African Americans freedom and equal rights is sheer fantasy. As for those who deliberately spread such ideas, they are shameless deceivers. Oppressed peoples want freedom; they must seize power. To gain power, they must go through violent revolutionary struggle.

Chairman Mao said: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power. The counter-revolutionaries' desperate struggle against revolutionary forces is also entirely for the purpose of maintaining their power." Over the long years, African Americans have shed blood on the land of this dollar empire in their struggle for freedom. Has this not proven the point? Now, the African American masses not only understand that they must struggle for power but also understand that they must use violence to seize power. This is a major turning point in the revolutionary struggle of African Americans.

At this time, American imperialism has intensified its violent suppression of the black movement. The reason is clear: it is to consolidate its rear, so as to intensify its aggression against Vietnam. The African American masses shout: "Vietnam and Watts—fighting the same battle." This is absolutely true.

African Americans are an important revolutionary force among the hundreds of millions of oppressed people in the United States and are the backbone of the movement against the war in Vietnam. Together with other oppressed peoples in the United States, African Americans are stirring up a revolutionary storm from within the United States to oppose their own imperialism. This is a great thing for the anti-American struggle of the world.

The just struggle of African Americans is not isolated; it is closely linked with the struggle of revolutionary peoples around the world against American imperialism and its lackeys.

In front of African Americans and all the people of the United States, the road of struggle is still long, arduous, and tortuous. But the night will surely end. The current situation of the enemy being strong and us being weak will definitely change in the opposite direction. The future of the United States does not belong to the reactionary forces that are strong on the outside but hollow on the inside, but to the American people, including the 22 million African Americans.

Chairman Mao said: "The evil system of colonialism and imperialism, which rose to prosperity with the enslavement and trafficking of black people, will surely come to an end with the thorough liberation of the black race." This is the conclusion, this is the law of historical development.

### 美国黑人在奋勇前进——纪念毛主席发表《支持美国黑人反对美帝国主义种族歧视的正义斗争的声明》三周年

    美国黑人在奋勇前进
    ——纪念毛主席发表《支持美国黑人反对美帝国主义种族歧视的正义斗争的声明》三周年
    今天是毛泽东主席发表《支持美国黑人反对美帝国主义种族歧视的正义斗争的声明》三周年，首都各界人民将举行反对美帝国主义、支持美国黑人反对种族歧视大会。七亿中国人民永远站在美国黑人一边，站在美国人民一边，同他们一起反对全世界人民的共同敌人美帝国主义，坚决支持他们的正义斗争。
    毛主席在三年前就曾正确地指出：“民族斗争，说到底，是一个阶级斗争问题。”这个一针见血的马克思主义的分析和论断，指明了美国黑人争取解放的方向和道路。毛主席的声明，大大增强了美国黑人战斗的勇气和胜利的信心，鼓舞了全世界一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命斗争。
    三年来，美国黑人反对种族歧视、争取自由和平等权利的斗争，有了很大的发展。一个突出的特点，就是美国黑人群众越来越广泛地展开了暴力自卫斗争，英勇地用革命的暴力来反对反革命的暴力。约翰逊政府血腥镇压美国黑人的斗争的结果，使越来越多的黑人群众看破了美国统治集团的政治欺骗，丢掉幻想，奋起斗争。他们在自己的革命斗争实践中，找到了依靠暴力来自己争取自由和解放的正确道路。这是美国黑人空前觉醒的标志。
    最近，美国黑人在抗暴斗争中，提出了“黑人要权力”的口号，这是美国黑人斗争的又一个重要的发展。在阶级社会里，只有残酷无情的阶级压迫，哪有什么平等权利。以为杀人不眨眼的华尔街老板们会发善心，会恩赐给黑人以自由和平等的权利，不过是十足的幻想。至于那些有意散布这种说法的人，更是无耻的欺骗。被压迫人民要自由，就必须夺取权力；要获得权力，只有通过暴力的革命斗争。
    毛主席说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力作斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”在漫长的年代里，美国黑人为争取自由而洒遍在这个金元帝国土地上的鲜血，难道还没有证明这一点吗？现在美国黑人群众不仅懂得了要争取权力，而且懂得了要用暴力去夺取权力。这是美国黑人革命斗争史上一个重大的转折。
    美帝国主义在这个时候加强了对黑人运动的暴力镇压，原因是很清楚的，这就是要巩固它的后方，以便加紧扩大侵略越南的战争。美国黑人群众高呼：“越南和瓦茨区——从事同一个斗争”。这是千真万确的。
    美国黑人是美国亿万被压迫人民中一支重要的革命力量，也是美国人民反对侵越战争运动的中坚。美国黑人同美国其它被压迫人民一起，从美国内部掀起革命风暴，反对本国帝国主义，这对于全世界的反美斗争是一件大大的好事。
    美国黑人的正义斗争并不是孤立的，是同全世界革命人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争密切联系在一起的。
    在美国黑人和全美国人民的面前，斗争道路仍然是漫长的、艰苦的、曲折的。但是，黑夜总有尽头。目前敌强我弱的形势，是一定会向相反的方向起变化的。美国的未来，不属于外强中干的美国反动势力，而属于包括二千二百万黑人在内的美国人民。
    毛主席说：“万恶的殖民主义、帝国主义制度是随着奴役和贩卖黑人而兴盛起来的，它也必将随着黑色人种的彻底解放而告终。”这就是结论，这就是历史发展的规律。
