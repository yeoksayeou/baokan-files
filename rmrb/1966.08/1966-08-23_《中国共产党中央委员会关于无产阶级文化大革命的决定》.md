Since the Cultural Revolution is a revolution, it is inevitable that there will be resistance. This resistance mainly comes from those who have infiltrated the Party and are taking the capitalist road, and also from the old social forces. This resistance is still quite strong and tenacious at present. However, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is an irresistible trend. Facts have shown that as long as the masses are fully mobilized, this resistance will quickly be overcome.

    文化革命既然是革命，就不可避免地会有阻力。这种阻力，主要来自那些混进党内的走资本主义道路的当权派，同时也来自旧的社会习惯势力。这种阻力目前还是相当大的，顽强的。但是，无产阶级文化大革命毕竟是大势所趋，不可阻挡。大量事实说明，只要群众充分发动起来了，这种阻力就会迅速被冲垮。
