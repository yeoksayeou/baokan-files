Excellent!

	We cheer for the revolutionary rebel spirit of the proletariat shown by the "Red Guards" of Beijing!

	Chairman Mao said: "The thousands of principles of Marxism can be summed up in one sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.'"

	"With a golden monkey's cudgel, the heavens are swept clean of dust." The "Red Guards" use Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, sweeping away all the dust of the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes.

	Beijing has been liberated for seventeen years, but under the long-term control and suppression of the revisionist former Beijing Municipal Committee, many place names, shop signs, and outdated practices in the service industry still exude the rotten air of feudalism and capitalism, poisoning people's souls. The broad revolutionary masses can no longer tolerate this!

	Where the broom does not reach, the dust will not disappear on its own. Millions of "Red Guards" have taken up iron brooms, and in just a few days, they have thoroughly cleaned out many names and customs that represent the ideas of the exploiting classes.

	This is a revolutionary action to destroy the old and establish the new. New names, new customs, and new habits that shine with the spirit of proletarian revolution add endless luster to our great capital, the center of proletarian revolution.

	Revolutionary signs and words are everywhere, revolutionary language and songs are everywhere. Every street, every shop, every industry must become a school for studying Mao Zedong Thought, a bastion for propagating, implementing, and defending Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is illuminating every corner.

	This is a heartening event, a joyous occasion that delights the heart.

	The revolutionary spirit of the "Red Guards" will keep our country and people forever young in revolution.

	The revolutionary actions of the "Red Guards" are an irresistible torrent that no stubborn old forces can block.

	The proletarian revolutionary rebel spirit of the "Red Guards" is excellent!

    好得很！
    我们为北京市“红卫兵”小将们的无产阶级革命造反精神欢呼！
    毛主席说：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’”
    “金猴奋起千钧棒，玉宇澄清万里埃。”“红卫兵”小将们以毛泽东思想为武器，正在横扫一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯的灰尘。
    北京解放已经十七年了，可是，在修正主义的前北京市委长期把持、压制下，许多地方的名称、商店的字号，服务行业的不少陈规陋习，仍然散发着封建主义、资本主义的腐朽气息，毒化着人们的灵魂。广大革命群众，对这些实在不能再容忍了！
    扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。千千万万“红卫兵”举起了铁扫帚，在短短几天之内，就把这些代表着剥削阶级思想的许多名称和风俗习惯，来了个大扫除。
    这是破旧立新的革命行动。闪耀着无产阶级革命精神的新名称，新风俗，新习惯，为我们伟大的首都，为无产阶级革命的中心，增添了无限的光彩。
    处处是革命的标志和文字，处处是革命的语言和歌声。每个街道，每个商店，每个行业，都要成为学习毛泽东思想的学校，成为宣传、执行和捍卫毛泽东思想的阵地。毛泽东思想正在照亮每一个角落。
    这是振奋人心的大事，这是大快人心的喜事。
    “红卫兵”的革命精神，将使我们的国家和人民永葆革命的青春。
    “红卫兵”的革命行为，是任何顽固的旧势力也阻挡不了的洪流。
    “红卫兵”的无产阶级革命造反精神好得很！
