	Five Good Exemplars, Deputy Instructor Lin Yuanfang of Drilling Team 1202 in Daqing: Be a Soldier Without a Uniform

	I am a soldier who transferred from the military to Daqing. I feel that the atmosphere of the People's Liberation Army in Daqing is truly strong. Here, we study military affairs, politics, and culture, and we also engage in agricultural and sideline production. Life is the same as in the army, with unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness.

	Coming to Daqing is like enlisting in the army. The first lesson is class education. The unit visits the history of the regiment, learns from the glorious traditions and excellent styles of the old soldiers. On the night I transferred to the oil field, the worker teachers led us to visit the team history exhibition and gave us a book of class struggle. They taught us to carry on the revolutionary cause and never forget class struggle. The next day, like issuing guns to soldiers, we were given the books of Chairman Mao.

	In Daqing, everyone learns from the People's Liberation Army. Like the soldiers, we study Chairman Mao's works with class feelings, and we work hard on every detail, always putting politics first. The army has the "Three Eights" style, and Daqing also emphasizes the "Three Eights" style, focusing on the "Three Olds and Four Stricts" and "Four Equals" style. The people of Daqing, with a strong class consciousness and awareness of the enemy, engage in class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation. Going to the well site is like going to the battlefield, treating tools as weapons, and seeing every additional meter drilled as a contribution to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. On duty, it is like a sentry on guard, strictly guarding the post. Like the soldiers who cherish their weapons, we maintain and repair machinery at all times.

	Our team has more than twenty transferred soldiers, all of whom actively help those who have not served in the army to learn military skills and the excellent styles of the People's Liberation Army. Everyone ensures that while the person transfers, the ideology does not. Together with all the workers, we work and train, holding tools in one hand and guns in the other, ensuring that we not only drill wells well but also master the skills to fight the enemy. We become revolutionary soldiers who are both workers and farmers, both intellectuals and soldiers.

    五好标兵、大庆一二○二钻井队副指导员林元芳：
    做一个不穿军装的解放军
    我是从解放军转业来大庆的。我感到大庆大学解放军的空气真是浓厚。在这里，我们学军事、学政治、学文化，还搞农副业生产。生活和部队一样，团结、紧张、严肃、活泼。
    来到大庆，和参军入伍一样，第一课就是阶级教育课。部队参观连队史，学习老战士的光荣传统和优良作风。我转业来到油田的当天晚上，工人老师傅领我们参观队史展览，交给了我们一本阶级斗争账。教育我们接好革命班，千万不要忘记阶级斗争。第二天，像给战士发枪一样，发给毛主席的书。
    在大庆，人人都学解放军。像解放军那样，带着阶级感情活学活用毛主席著作，在用字上狠下功夫，时时、事事、处处突出政治。部队是“三八”作风，大庆也是处处讲“三八”作风，讲以严细准狠为核心的“三老四严”、“四个一样”的作风。大庆人带着强烈的阶级感情和敌情观念搞阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验。上井场，如同战士上战场，把工具当刀枪，每多打进一米，都看做是对中国革命和世界革命的贡献。值班就像哨兵站岗一样，严守岗位。像解放军爱护武器一样，时刻保养检修机械。
    我们队共有二十多名转业战士，都积极帮助没当过兵的人学军事技术，学解放军的优良作风。大家做到人转业，思想不转业。和全体职工一起又做工又练武，一手拿工具，一手拿枪，做到不仅能打好井，而且掌握打敌人的本领，做亦工亦农、亦文亦武的革命战士。
