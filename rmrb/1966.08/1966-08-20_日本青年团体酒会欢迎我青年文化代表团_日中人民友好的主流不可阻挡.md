Japanese Youth Organizations Host Reception for Chinese Youth Cultural Delegation
The Irresistible Trend of Sino-Japanese People's Friendship

According to Xinhua News Agency in Tokyo on August 17th, the Chairman of the Socialist Youth League of Japan, Fukaoka Hatsuji, emphasized at the reception held in Tokyo on the 16th to welcome the Chinese Youth Cultural Delegation that the youth of Japan and China should unite as one. They must strive to make the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival even more successful.

A member of the Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Party, Akamatsu Yu, said that the friendship between the peoples of Japan and China is based on the struggle against their common enemy, American imperialism. The friendship between the peoples of Japan and China is the trend of history and cannot be stopped by anyone.

The Chinese Youth Cultural Delegation expressed at the reception that the fighting friendship between the peoples and youth of China and Japan is full of vitality. It will break through all kinds of artificial obstacles, whether open or covert, new or old, and continue to develop.

Amidst the strong atmosphere of strengthening friendship and unity between the peoples and youth of China and Japan at the reception, there were voices that were very discordant with this atmosphere. A member of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Democratic Youth League of Japan, Oyama, on the one hand, talked about the "unity" of all "socialist countries," including the Soviet revisionist leadership, and about "international united actions" that do not distinguish between enemies and friends and are without principles. On the other hand, regarding the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival, which is conducive to strengthening the unity of Sino-Japanese youth, he used the excuse of "tight international situation" to reiterate his organization's stubborn stance of refusing to participate.

At the reception, the hosts and guests discussed their fighting friendship and frequently raised their glasses to toast the friendship and unity between the youth of China and Japan, pointing out that this is the trend of the times. In this situation, the representative of the Democratic Youth League of Japan found himself in a very awkward position.

### 日本青年团体酒会欢迎我青年文化代表团  日中人民友好的主流不可阻挡

　　日本青年团体酒会欢迎我青年文化代表团
    日中人民友好的主流不可阻挡
    据新华社东京十七日电　日本社会主义青年同盟委员长深田肇，十六日在东京举行的欢迎中国青年文化代表团的酒会上强调指出，日中两国青年要团结一致。一定要尽力使第二届日中青年友好大联欢获得更大的成功。
    社会党中央执行委员会委员赤松勇说，日中两国人民的友好是以同两国人民的共同敌人美帝国主义斗争为基础的。日中两国人民的友好事业，是历史的主流，决不是任何人所能阻挡的。
    中国青年文化代表团在酒会上表示，中日人民和青年的战斗友谊是具有伟大生命力的，它将冲破一切明的暗的和新的旧的人为障碍，不断向前发展。
    在酒会上加强中日两国人民和青年友好团结的强烈气氛中，却有人发出了同这种气氛很不协调的声音。日本民主青年同盟中央委员会常务委员小山在发言时，一方面大谈包括苏联修正主义领导集团在内的“一切社会主义国家”的“团结”，大谈不分敌我、毫无原则的“国际统一行动”，另一方面，对于有助于加强中日青年团结的第二届中日青年友好大联欢，他却以“国际形势很紧张”为借口，重申他代表的组织拒不参加的顽固立场。
    在酒会上，宾主畅谈战斗友谊，频频举杯祝中日青年友好团结，指出这是时代的主流。在这种情况下，日本民主青年同盟的代表处于十分尴尬的地位。
