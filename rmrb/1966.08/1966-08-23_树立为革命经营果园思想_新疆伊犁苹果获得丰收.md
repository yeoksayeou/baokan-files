The famous apple-producing region in western China, the Ili apple orchards, have had a bumper harvest.

In recent years, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the people's communes of the Ili region have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works earnestly. They have established the idea of managing orchards for the revolution. This year, the amount of fertilizer applied to the fruit trees, as well as the number of times they were watered, weeded, loosened soil, and sprayed with pesticides, have all increased several times compared to last year. Some orchards have applied over 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu on average.

    树立为革命经营果园思想
    新疆伊犁苹果获得丰收
    我国西部著名的苹果产区——伊犁苹果丰收。
    近几年来，伊犁地区各人民公社广大贫农下中农社员活学活用毛主席著作，树立了为革命经营果园的思想。他们今年给果树施肥量和浇水、除草、松土、喷药的次数，比去年成倍地增加，有些果园平均每亩施肥万斤以上。
