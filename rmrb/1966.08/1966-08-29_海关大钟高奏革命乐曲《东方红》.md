On the morning of August 28, at exactly 7 a.m., the towering bell of the Shanghai Customs House on the banks of the Huangpu River rang out the revolutionary song "The East Is Red" for the first time, praising the great leader Chairman Mao. The bell's chimes echoed across the vast sky. Upon hearing this stirring melody, the people were overjoyed and spontaneously shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!"

The change of the Shanghai Customs House bell's chimes to the song "The East Is Red" was a strong desire of the revolutionary masses of Shanghai for many years. In the torrent of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the initiative was taken by the Red Guards, and it was realized in just a few days!

On the morning of the 23rd, the Red Guards posted the first batch of big-character posters on the gate of the Shanghai Customs House. In the posters, they wrote: On the bell of the customs house of New China, we cannot allow the continued ringing of the time-keeping music left over from British imperialism. The remnants of imperialist rule must be removed, and this decadent and corrupt music must be changed! The Red Guards strongly demanded that the melody "The East Is Red, the sun rises, China has given birth to a Mao Zedong..." should forever resonate in the hearts of the people of Shanghai, forever resonate in the hearts of the people of China and revolutionary people all over the world.

From its construction until the liberation, the Shanghai Customs House was under the control of imperialist bandits for over a hundred years. After liberation, the Chinese people regained control of the customs house and truly became its masters. However, the time-keeping music of the customs house bell remained the "old tune" and had not been changed. The Red Guards' demand to change the customs house bell's time-keeping music sparked the strongest response among the broad revolutionary masses, immediately receiving the strongest support from people of all walks of life. Posters encouraging the fight and expressing warm regards poured in. The revolutionary workers of the original Beijing Clock Factory, who had made the clock for Beijing Railway Station, with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, bravely took on the glorious mission: they declared that they would, in the shortest time possible, make the customs house bell ring out the revolutionary anthem "The East Is Red." A radio factory sent high-fidelity speakers, and some factories immediately dispatched experienced workers; three young workers from the Shanghai Musical Instrument Factory rushed to the scene to help with the tuning, and representatives from the revolutionary teachers and students of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music also joined the workers in the struggle.

The melody of "The East Is Red" ringing out from the Shanghai Customs House bell is the song of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the marching song of the Red Guards and revolutionary masses charging into the old world! The bell calls on people to rise up in revolution, and the bell inspires people to destroy the old and establish the new. The bell solemnly proclaims: Under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, we revolutionary people will not only thoroughly smash the old world but also build a brand-new world of the proletariat!

    海关大钟高奏革命乐曲《东方红》
    八月二十八日，清晨七时整，高耸在黄浦江畔的上海海关大钟，第一次响起歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的《东方红》乐曲，钟声震荡在万里晴空。听到这支激动人心的乐曲，人们一片欢腾，情不自禁地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”
    上海海关大钟报时音乐改为《东方红》乐曲，这是上海全市革命群众多年来的强烈愿望。在无产阶级文化大革命的洪流中，由红卫兵革命小将们发起倡议，几天内就实现了！
    二十三日上午，红卫兵们在上海海关的大门上，贴出了第一批革命大字报。他们在大字报上写道：在新中国的海关大钟上，不能允许继续敲着英帝国主义残留下来的报时音乐。帝国主义统治的残余钟声一定要去掉，这种没落腐朽的音乐一定要改变！红卫兵们强烈要求：尽快地让“东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东……”乐曲，永远响彻在上海人民的心里，永远响彻在中国人民和全世界革命人民的心里。
    上海海关，从建成到解放前的一百多年里，长期操纵在帝国主义强盗手里，解放以后，中国人民夺回了海关大权，真正成了海关的主人。但是海关大钟的报时音乐，还一直是“老调子”，没有改变。红卫兵要求革掉海关大钟报时音乐的大字报，在广大革命群众中引起了最强烈的反响，立刻得到各界人民最强有力的支持。鼓舞斗志、热情慰问的大字报一张张送来了。曾为北京火车站制造过大钟的原倍高钟厂的革命职工，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的深情，勇敢地承担了光荣的使命：他们表示，要在最短的时间里，让海关大钟高奏革命赞歌《东方红》。一家无线电工厂送来了高音喇叭，有的厂还立即派来了有经验的工人；上海乐器厂的三个青年职工赶到了现场帮助校音，上海音乐学院革命师生也派出代表，和工人们一起战斗。
    上海海关大钟传出的《东方红》乐曲声，是无产阶级文化大革命的歌声，是红卫兵和革命群众向旧世界冲锋陷阵的进行曲！钟声召唤人们起来革命，钟声激励人们破旧立新。钟声庄严宣告：我们革命人民在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，不仅要彻底摧毁旧世界，而且能够建设一个崭新的无产阶级新世界！
