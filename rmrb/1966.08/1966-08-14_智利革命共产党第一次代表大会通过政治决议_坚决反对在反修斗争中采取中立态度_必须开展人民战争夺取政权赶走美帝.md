The Revolutionary Communist Party of Chile recently published the political resolution of the First Marxist-Leninist Congress of Chilean Communists.

The resolution states that U.S. imperialism is the number one enemy of the people of all countries and condemns the war plans and actions of U.S. imperialism aimed at world domination as the most vicious threat to peace. After pointing out the evil intentions of U.S. imperialism to dominate the globe, the resolution states, "We resolutely oppose the imperialist strategy, participate in the great united front of the peoples of all countries against U.S. imperialism, and contribute in every possible way to the development, militancy, and revolutionary direction of this front."

The resolution says, "The principal contradiction of our times is between the peoples of various countries oppressed by imperialism and imperialism itself." The resolution points out that the heroic national struggle of the Vietnamese people is the main focus of the fight against U.S. imperialism and expresses resolute and effective support for this struggle. It supports the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the four-point proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, opposing the conspiracy of imperialists and revisionists who, on the one hand, use the pretext of "unconditional negotiations" and false promises of peace to force the Vietnamese people to surrender, while on the other hand, actually intensify their aggression against this heroic people.

The resolution then condemns and opposes the United Nations and its regional organizations, especially the Organization of American States, stating that these organizations are tools used by U.S. imperialism to conceal and implement its plans for world domination. It condemns and opposes the efforts of revisionists to beautify and cover up the reactionary role of the United Nations.

The resolution emphasizes the need to resolutely oppose modern revisionism. It denounces modern revisionists as agents of the bourgeoisie within the revolutionary movement. The leaders of the CPSU, in cooperating with U.S. imperialism, aim to jointly dominate the world.

The resolution expresses opposition to the revisionist theory that claims revolution and liberation can be achieved through the "peaceful path"; it opposes their attempt to place the coexistence of socialism and capitalism and peaceful economic competition above the revolutionary struggle for the liberation of the peoples of various countries; it opposes their attempt to extend this coexistence to the relationship between oppressed peoples and oppressors or between hostile classes; it opposes their claim that the principal contradiction of our times is not between the peoples oppressed by imperialism and imperialism; it opposes their attempt to make agreements and compromises with imperialism and to surrender to imperialist war blackmail as the main content of the struggle for peace, thereby fostering defeatism and terror in the face of nuclear weapons or illusions about imperialism.

The resolution also denounces the revisionist bureaucratic class in the countries they control, where they are carrying out capitalist restoration, destroying the proletarian and Marxist-Leninist nature of the Communist Party, and abolishing the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The resolution states, "We resolutely expose and oppose the so-called 'neutralist' attitude towards the current struggle of Marxist-Leninists against modern revisionism. This is not only a wrong and very harmful attitude to the interests of the revolution, but also a collusion with the revisionists. Those who advocate this 'neutralism' hypocritically use the feelings of unity among the peoples of various countries to try to make the people follow the slogans of the revisionists, to lead the people towards a principle-less 'unity,' and to obstruct the revolutionaries from opposing and exposing these slogans."

The resolution, after analyzing the various common factors currently existing among the countries of Latin America, especially the exploitation and aggression of U.S. imperialism against the countries of Latin America, points out, "All this determines the possibility and necessity of the integration of the revolutionary movements of our continent. For this, it is necessary to coordinate actions and raise mutual support to the highest level, so as to break the chains of domination of U.S. imperialism and the local reactionaries in various parts of Latin America." The resolution advocates that the true Marxist-Leninist Communist Parties of the countries of Latin America "should follow a policy of uniting with all social forces, groups, parties, and individuals who are willing to fight against U.S. imperialism and the revisionist accomplices of the reactionaries of each country through the revolutionary path."

In discussing the situation in Cuba, the resolution strongly condemns the increasing collusion of the Cuban leadership with revisionists, manifested in their attempts to deny and destroy Marxist-Leninist parties and groups; their secret meetings and agreements with known revisionists; their defense of opportunist views of revisionists in joint communiqués and international conferences; their treacherous and unjust attacks on the People's Republic of China, which participate in the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to isolate and invade this great socialist country; and their active promotion of 'neutralism' in the struggle of Marxist-Leninists against revisionism, in order to achieve principle-less 'unity,' etc.

In discussing armed struggle, the resolution expresses opposition to the policies of some groups that follow petty-bourgeois lines and mechanically apply the experience of the Cuban armed struggle. These groups believe that a military group starting armed struggle is sufficient to mobilize the masses to participate in the struggle to seize power, while neglecting the indispensable foundation for launching a people's war, that is, neglecting the need to establish a Marxist-Leninist party to lead the masses and eliminate the influence of revisionism among the masses. The resolution also denounces the cunning and hypocritical plots of revisionists who, in places where they can no longer promote the lie of the 'peaceful path,' pretend to support such uprisings that are detached from the masses and ineffective, in order to discredit the path of armed seizure of power, while still maintaining their influence over the masses.

The political resolution finally "reminds the revolutionaries of Latin America to be vigilant against the possibility that U.S. imperialism may expand the war of aggression against Vietnam to the peoples of Southeast Asia, especially China. In this case, we must be prepared to strengthen our struggle against imperialism and our fighting solidarity." The resolution also reminds the revolutionaries of Latin America to be vigilant against the possibility that U.S. imperialism and the reactionaries of each country may suddenly launch a wave of repression on our continent.

At this congress, a resolution on domestic issues was also adopted. This resolution first clearly declares the establishment of the Revolutionary Communist Party of Chile, stating: "Considering that the so-called Communist Party of Chile has never implemented Marxist-Leninist principles in its political line and political activities, and since the Twenty-second Congress of the CPSU, its leaders have openly and consciously adopted the opportunist line advocated by modern revisionists as their own line, it is decided to establish the Revolutionary Communist Party of Chile." The resolution points out that the Revolutionary Communist Party of Chile will be organized according to Leninist principles.

The resolution states: "The Revolutionary Communist Party considers U.S. imperialism to be the most vicious enemy of our people and will lead the masses to direct the main thrust of their struggle against U.S. imperialism and its main allies in our country: the large landowners and the monopolistic, financial bourgeoisie." The basic goal of the Revolutionary Communist Party of Chile is to achieve socialism and transform socialism into communism, while first carrying out a people's democratic revolution.

The resolution states: "The Revolutionary Communist Party will forge a solid worker-peasant alliance, using it as a basis to attract as many strata of the urban petty bourgeoisie and other non-proletarian strata that can be won over as possible to the united front against imperialism, large landowners, and the monopolistic, financial bourgeoisie." The resolution states that after seizing power, a people's democratic government will be established as a form of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The resolution states: "The Revolutionary Communist Party believes that the only possible way to overthrow the most reactionary forces, expel U.S. imperialism from Chile, and seize power is to launch an armed people's war against these ruling classes, and therefore resolutely opposes the so-called 'peaceful path' proposed by revisionists as a means of revolution." It also points out that the armed people's war will be firmly led by the party of the proletariat, and the people's war to seize power will be a long-term armed struggle; its main stage will be the countryside, although it will also receive strong support from urban struggles.

The resolution states that the Christian Democratic government of Chile "attempts to implement a reformist deception policy, which is an experiment planned by U.S. imperialism," and points out the insurmountable contradictions and inevitable failure of this reformist plan both domestically and internationally.

The resolution also exposes the opportunist and reformist policies of the Chilean revisionists.

The final part of the resolution on domestic issues states: "It is of fundamental importance to purge the influence of revisionism and the bourgeoisie within the masses and to unite the masses around Marxism-Leninism and the revolution in all aspects, so that their consciousness and struggle develop towards the direction of seizing power." It also points out that the current central task of the Revolutionary Communist Party of Chile is to develop and consolidate our party in terms of quality and quantity, strengthen its influence and connection with the masses, especially with workers and peasants. We must resolutely lead the people's struggle, strive to enhance its militancy, develop it into a mass revolutionary armed struggle to seize power, while preserving our organization to carry out the inevitable arduous and protracted struggle."

This congress was held in May and was initiated by the Spartacus Revolutionary Organization, with representatives from the Communist Insurrection Alliance and the revolutionary cadres who broke with revisionism within the Communist Party of Chile participating.

　　智利革命共产党第一次代表大会通过政治决议
　　坚决反对在反修斗争中采取中立态度
　　必须开展人民战争夺取政权赶走美帝
    新华社十三日讯　圣地亚哥消息：智利革命共产党最近公布了智利共产党人第一次马克思列宁主义代表大会的政治决议。
    决议认为美帝国主义是世界各国人民的头号敌人；并且谴责美帝国主义目的在于统治世界的战争计划和战争行动是对和平的最凶恶的威胁。决议在指出美帝国主义企图霸占全球的罪恶目的之后表示，“坚决反对帝国主义的战略，参加各国人民反对美帝国主义的伟大的统一战线，尽一切可能为这一战线的发展、战斗性和革命方针做出贡献。”
    决议说：“我们时代的主要矛盾是受帝国主义奴役的各国人民和帝国主义之间的矛盾。”决议指出越南人民的英勇爱国斗争是同美帝国主义进行战斗的主要焦点，表示坚决地、有效地支持这一斗争，坚决支持越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明和越南民主共和国的四项主张，反对帝国主义和修正主义分子一面玩弄通过“无条件谈判”和虚伪的和平诺言使越南人民投降的联合阴谋，而另方面，实际上正加强对这个英雄人民的侵略。
    决议接着谴责和反对联合国及其区域性机构，特别是美洲国家组织，认为这些组织都是美帝国主义用来掩盖和推行其统治世界的侵略计划的工具。谴责和反对修正主义分子为美化和掩盖联合国反动作用而做的努力。
    决议强调必须坚决反对现代修正主义。它谴责现代修正主义分子是资产阶级在革命运动内部的代理人。苏共领导人同美帝国主义进行合作，其目的在于共同主宰世界。
    决议表示“特别反对认为通过‘和平道路’可以实现革命和解放各国人民的修正主义理论；反对他们把社会主义同资本主义和平共处及和平经济竞赛置于各国人民革命解放斗争之上的企图；反对他们把这种共处扩大到被压迫人民同压迫者之间或敌对阶级之间的关系中去的企图；反对他们否认受帝国主义奴役的民族同帝国主义间的矛盾具有我们时代的主要矛盾的性质这种主张；反对他们企图把同帝国主义达成协议和妥协以及向帝国主义战争讹诈投降当做争取和平斗争的主要内容，企图助长在原子武器面前的失败主义和恐怖情绪或对帝国主义的幻想。”
    决议还谴责修正主义官僚阶层在他们控制政权的那些国家搞资本主义复辟，破坏共产党的无产阶级和马克思列宁主义的性质，取消无产阶级专政。
    决议表示“坚决揭露和反对对马克思列宁主义者目前同现代修正主义展开的斗争采取所谓的‘中立主义’态度，这不仅是一种错误的、十分损害革命利益的态度，而且是同修正主义者狼狈为奸。宣扬这种‘中立主义’的人虚伪地利用各国人民的团结感情，企图使人民跟着修正主义者的口号跑，要把人民带向无原则的‘团结’，企图阻止革命者反对和揭露这些口号。”
    决议在分析了拉丁美洲国家间目前存在着各种共同的因素，特别是美帝国主义对拉丁美洲各国的剥削和侵略之后指出，“这一切决定了我们大陆的各革命运动一体化的可能性和必要性。为此必须协调行动并把互相支援提到最高的程度，以便在拉丁美洲各地打碎美帝国主义和本地反动派的统治枷锁。”决议主张拉丁美洲各国的真正马克思列宁主义共产党“必须奉行与所有愿意通过革命道路同美帝国主义和每个国家的反动派及其同谋者修正主义分子展开斗争的社会力量、小组、党派和人士结成统一战线的政策。”
    决议在谈到古巴局势时表示强烈谴责“古巴领导人日益同修正主义同谋，其表现是，他们企图不承认和破坏马克思列宁主义的党和小组；他们同那些众所周知的修正主义分子开黑会和达成协议；他们在联合公报和国际会议上维护修正主义分子的机会主义观点；诡谲而不公正地攻击中华人民共和国，这种攻击参加了美帝国主义为孤立和侵略这个伟大的社会主义国家而玩弄的阴谋；积极宣扬在马克思列宁主义者展开的反对修正主义斗争中的‘中立主义’，以利于无原则的‘团结’等等。”
    决议在谈到武装斗争时，表示反对一些遵循小资产阶级方针的集团所奉行的政策，它们企图机械地搬用古巴武装斗争的经验。他们奉行的政策的特点是，“相信一个军事小组展开行动、开始武装斗争就足以带动人民群众参加这种夺取政权的斗争，而忽视开展人民战争的必不可少的基础，即忽视必须成立一个马克思列宁主义党来领导人民群众和在人民群众中清除修正主义的影响。”决议还谴责修正主义分子的狡猾而虚伪的阴谋，他们在已经不能宣扬“和平道路”谎言的地方，假装支持这种脱离群众而不能取得成效的起义，以便促使武装夺取政权的道路丧失威信，而又可以保持他们对群众的影响。
    政治决议最后“提醒拉丁美洲的革命者警惕美帝国主义很可能把侵略越南的战争扩及东南亚各国人民，特别是扩及中国。在这种情况下，我们要准备好加强我们的反对帝国主义的斗争和我们的战斗声援。”决议还提醒拉丁美洲革命者警惕，美帝国主义和每个国家的反动派可能突然意外地在我们大陆掀起镇压浪潮。
    在这次代表大会上还通过了关于国内问题的决议。这项决议首先明确宣布成立智利革命共产党，它说：“考虑到所谓的智利共产党过去在政治路线和政治活动的基本方面从来没有执行过马克思列宁主义，自从苏共二十大以来，它的领导人就公开地和有意识地把现代修正主义者主张的机会主义路线当作自己的路线，因而决定建立智利革命共产党。”决议指出，智利革命共产党将根据列宁主义的准则组织起来。
    决议说：“革命共产党认为美帝国主义是我国人民最凶恶的敌人，并将领导人民群众把斗争的主要锋芒指向美帝国主义及其在我国的主要同盟者：大庄园主和垄断、金融资产阶级。”智利革命共产党的基本目标是实现社会主义并把社会主义转变为共产主义，而目前先实行人民民主革命。
    决议说：“革命共产党将缔结巩固的工农联盟，把它作为基础来尽可能地吸引城市中、小资产阶级各阶层以及可以争取的其他非无产阶级各阶层加入反帝、反大庄园主、反对垄断、金融资产阶级的统一战线。”决议说，在夺取政权后将建立人民民主政府，作为无产阶级专政的一种形式。
    决议说：“革命共产党认为，打倒最反动的势力、把美帝国主义赶出智利、夺取政权的唯一可能道路是开展反对这些统治阶级的武装的人民战争，因此斩钉截铁地反对修正主义者作为进行革命的手段而提出来的所谓‘和平道路’。”并且指出，武装的人民战争将由无产阶级的党进行坚定的领导，而夺取政权的人民战争将是一场长期的武装斗争；它的基本舞台将是农村，虽然同时它得到城市斗争的强大支持。
    决议说，智利的基督教民主党政府“企图实行的改良主义欺骗政策是美帝国主义策划的一次试验”，并且指出了这种改良主义计划在国内国际上所遇到的不可克服的矛盾和必然失败的前景。
    决议还揭露了智利修正主义分子的机会主义和改良主义的政策。
    关于国内问题的决议最后部分说：“具有根本意义的是在群众内部肃清修正主义和资产阶级的影响，在各个方面把群众统一在马克思列宁主义和革命的周围，从而使他们的觉悟和斗争得到朝着夺取政权的方向发展。”并且指出，智利革命共产党“目前中心任务是从质量上和数量上来发展和巩固我们的党，增强它的影响和与群众的联系，特别是和工人、农民的联系。我们要坚决地领导人民斗争，努力提高其战斗性，使之发展为夺取政权的群众革命武装斗争，同时保存我们的组织，以便进行必然是艰巨和持久的斗争。”
    这次代表大会在今年五月间举行，是由斯巴达克革命组织发起，有共产主义起义联盟和智利共产党中同修正主义决裂的革命干部派代表参加的。
