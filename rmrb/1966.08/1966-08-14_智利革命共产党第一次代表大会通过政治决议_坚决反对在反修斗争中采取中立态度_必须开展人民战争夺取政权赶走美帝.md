The Revolutionary Communist Party of Chile recently published the political resolution of the First Marxist-Leninist Congress of Chilean Communists.

The resolution states that U.S. imperialism is the number one enemy of the people of all countries and condemns the war plans and actions of U.S. imperialism aimed at world domination as the most vicious threat to peace. After pointing out the evil intentions of U.S. imperialism to dominate the globe, the resolution states, "We resolutely oppose the imperialist strategy, participate in the great united front of the peoples of all countries against U.S. imperialism, and contribute in every possible way to the development, militancy, and revolutionary direction of this front."

The resolution says, "The principal contradiction of our times is between the peoples of various countries oppressed by imperialism and imperialism itself." The resolution points out that the heroic national struggle of the Vietnamese people is the main focus of the fight against U.S. imperialism and expresses resolute and effective support for this struggle. It supports the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the four-point proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, opposing the conspiracy of imperialists and revisionists who, on the one hand, use the pretext of "unconditional negotiations" and false promises of peace to force the Vietnamese people to surrender, while on the other hand, actually intensify their aggression against this heroic people.

The resolution then condemns and opposes the United Nations and its regional organizations, especially the Organization of American States, stating that these organizations are tools used by U.S. imperialism to conceal and implement its plans for world domination. It condemns and opposes the efforts of revisionists to beautify and cover up the reactionary role of the United Nations.

The resolution emphasizes the need to resolutely oppose modern revisionism. It denounces modern revisionists as agents of the bourgeoisie within the revolutionary movement. The leaders of the CPSU, in cooperating with U.S. imperialism, aim to jointly dominate the world.

The resolution expresses opposition to the revisionist theory that claims revolution and liberation can be achieved through the "peaceful path"; it opposes their attempt to place the coexistence of socialism and capitalism and peaceful economic competition above the revolutionary struggle for the liberation of the peoples of various countries; it opposes their attempt to extend this coexistence to the relationship between oppressed peoples and oppressors or between hostile classes; it opposes their claim that the principal contradiction of our times is not between the peoples oppressed by imperialism and imperialism; it opposes their attempt to make agreements and compromises with imperialism and to surrender to imperialist war blackmail as the main content of the struggle for peace, thereby fostering defeatism and terror in the face of nuclear weapons or illusions about imperialism.

The resolution also denounces the revisionist bureaucratic class in the countries they control, where they are carrying out capitalist restoration, destroying the proletarian and Marxist-Leninist nature of the Communist Party, and abolishing the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The resolution states, "We resolutely expose and oppose the so-called 'neutralist' attitude towards the current struggle of Marxist-Leninists against modern revisionism. This is not only a wrong and very harmful attitude to the interests of the revolution, but also a collusion with the revisionists. Those who advocate this 'neutralism' hypocritically use the feelings of unity among the peoples of various countries to try to make the people follow the slogans of the revisionists, to lead the people towards a principle-less 'unity,' and to obstruct the revolutionaries from opposing and exposing these slogans."

The resolution, after analyzing the various common factors currently existing among the countries of Latin America, especially the exploitation and aggression of U.S. imperialism against the countries of Latin America, points out, "All this determines the possibility and necessity of the integration of the revolutionary movements of our continent. For this, it is necessary to coordinate actions and raise mutual support to the highest level, so as to break the chains of domination of U.S. imperialism and the local reactionaries in various parts of Latin America." The resolution advocates that the true Marxist-Leninist Communist Parties of the countries of Latin America "should follow a policy of uniting with all social forces, groups, parties, and individuals who are willing to fight against U.S. imperialism and the revisionist accomplices of the reactionaries of each country through the revolutionary path."

In discussing the situation in Cuba, the resolution strongly condemns the increasing collusion of the Cuban leadership with revisionists, manifested in their attempts to deny and destroy Marxist-Leninist parties and groups; their secret meetings and agreements with known revisionists; their defense of opportunist views of revisionists in joint communiqu√©s and international conferences; their treacherous and unjust attacks on the People's Republic of China, which participate in the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to isolate and invade this great socialist country; and their active promotion of 'neutralism' in the struggle of Marxist-Leninists against revisionism, in order to achieve principle-less 'unity,' etc.

In discussing armed struggle, the resolution expresses opposition to the policies of some groups that follow petty-bourgeois lines and mechanically apply the experience of the Cuban armed struggle. These groups believe that a military group starting armed struggle is sufficient to mobilize the masses to participate in the struggle to seize power, while neglecting the indispensable foundation for launching a people's war, that is, neglecting the need to establish a Marxist-Leninist party to lead the masses and eliminate the influence of revisionism among the masses. The resolution also denounces the cunning and hypocritical plots of revisionists who, in places where they can no longer promote the lie of the 'peaceful path,' pretend to support such uprisings that are detached from the masses and ineffective, in order to discredit the path of armed seizure of power, while still maintaining their influence over the masses.

The political resolution finally "reminds the revolutionaries of Latin America to be vigilant against the possibility that U.S. imperialism may expand the war of aggression against Vietnam to the peoples of Southeast Asia, especially China. In this case, we must be prepared to strengthen our struggle against imperialism and our fighting solidarity." The resolution also reminds the revolutionaries of Latin America to be vigilant against the possibility that U.S. imperialism and the reactionaries of each country may suddenly launch a wave of repression on our continent.

At this congress, a resolution on domestic issues was also adopted. This resolution first clearly declares the establishment of the Revolutionary Communist Party of Chile, stating: "Considering that the so-called Communist Party of Chile has never implemented Marxist-Leninist principles in its political line and political activities, and since the Twenty-second Congress of the CPSU, its leaders have openly and consciously adopted the opportunist line advocated by modern revisionists as their own line, it is decided to establish the Revolutionary Communist Party of Chile." The resolution points out that the Revolutionary Communist Party of Chile will be organized according to Leninist principles.

The resolution states: "The Revolutionary Communist Party considers U.S. imperialism to be the most vicious enemy of our people and will lead the masses to direct the main thrust of their struggle against U.S. imperialism and its main allies in our country: the large landowners and the monopolistic, financial bourgeoisie." The basic goal of the Revolutionary Communist Party of Chile is to achieve socialism and transform socialism into communism, while first carrying out a people's democratic revolution.

The resolution states: "The Revolutionary Communist Party will forge a solid worker-peasant alliance, using it as a basis to attract as many strata of the urban petty bourgeoisie and other non-proletarian strata that can be won over as possible to the united front against imperialism, large landowners, and the monopolistic, financial bourgeoisie." The resolution states that after seizing power, a people's democratic government will be established as a form of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The resolution states: "The Revolutionary Communist Party believes that the only possible way to overthrow the most reactionary forces, expel U.S. imperialism from Chile, and seize power is to launch an armed people's war against these ruling classes, and therefore resolutely opposes the so-called 'peaceful path' proposed by revisionists as a means of revolution." It also points out that the armed people's war will be firmly led by the party of the proletariat, and the people's war to seize power will be a long-term armed struggle; its main stage will be the countryside, although it will also receive strong support from urban struggles.

The resolution states that the Christian Democratic government of Chile "attempts to implement a reformist deception policy, which is an experiment planned by U.S. imperialism," and points out the insurmountable contradictions and inevitable failure of this reformist plan both domestically and internationally.

The resolution also exposes the opportunist and reformist policies of the Chilean revisionists.

The final part of the resolution on domestic issues states: "It is of fundamental importance to purge the influence of revisionism and the bourgeoisie within the masses and to unite the masses around Marxism-Leninism and the revolution in all aspects, so that their consciousness and struggle develop towards the direction of seizing power." It also points out that the current central task of the Revolutionary Communist Party of Chile is to develop and consolidate our party in terms of quality and quantity, strengthen its influence and connection with the masses, especially with workers and peasants. We must resolutely lead the people's struggle, strive to enhance its militancy, develop it into a mass revolutionary armed struggle to seize power, while preserving our organization to carry out the inevitable arduous and protracted struggle."

This congress was held in May and was initiated by the Spartacus Revolutionary Organization, with representatives from the Communist Insurrection Alliance and the revolutionary cadres who broke with revisionism within the Communist Party of Chile participating.
