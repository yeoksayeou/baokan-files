The organ of the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist), the "Pioneer," said in its August 18 issue that the current situation in Vietnam has verified Chairman Mao Zedong's theory of people's war.

The "Pioneer" pointed out that Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, developed and expounded the theory of people's war in the course of leading the Chinese people in their armed struggle for liberation. This theory, it said, has not only become a treasure of the Chinese people but also a treasure of the peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America.

The "Pioneer" said, "Mao Zedong has pointed out that the characteristic of people's war is that in people's war, the people develop their own strength, strengthen their own strength, and finally overwhelm the aggressor who has a great advantage at the outset. This is the reality in Vietnam today."

In discussing the fact that the United States is coercing Australia to send more mercenary troops to South Vietnam, the "Pioneer" said that the United States is compelled to send more troops to Vietnam on a large scale. This fact itself proves its failure. The U.S. imperialists, for reasons of their own global strategy, do not want to get deeply involved in Vietnam. But the law of their aggression makes it impossible for them to choose. They have to send in more troops; they will continue to do so until they meet their final doom.

The "Pioneer" said that the heroic resistance of the Vietnamese people is making the Australian people understand the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism, making them understand that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the peoples of all countries and can be defeated. It called for intensifying the struggle against U.S. imperialism and for Australian national independence.

The New China News Agency, Yangon, August 25: Burmese writer and journalist Ma Nai Wen recently told a New China News Agency correspondent here that Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful and sharpest weapon possessed by the revolutionary peoples of the world, and is the highest directive for the action of the revolutionary peoples of the world.

He said with deep emotion: Now, not only in China but also in other countries, people are acclaiming Mao Zedong Thought, because Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light for all the oppressed and exploited peoples.

Ma Nai Wen said: "Revolutionaries and genuine Marxist-Leninists in various countries often study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. They admire the greatest leader and teacher of the proletariat of our time, Mao Zedong." He said: "All revolutionaries have recognized that Mao Zedong Thought is absolutely correct. The great events that have taken place in China and the world, past and present, have proved this, and future events will also prove this."

In discussing Chairman Mao's famous statement made 20 years ago in his talk with the American journalist Anna Louise Strong, that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers, Ma Nai Wen said that Chairman Mao's most famous and wise statement is the greatest and most profound analysis of the class nature of imperialism and all reactionaries. It points out the weak essence of imperialism and all reactionaries, which appear to be strong.

He said: "Chairman Mao's most profound and lucid analysis of imperialism and reactionaries has always encouraged and inspired the peoples of the world to struggle against these dying forces."

    新华社墨尔本电　澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）机关报《先锋报》十八日在评述越南战局时，强调指出：目前越南的现实，证实了中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东主席关于人民战争的理论。
    《先锋报》强调指出：中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东主席在领导中国人民争取解放的武装斗争的过程中，“发展和透彻地阐明了人民战争的理论。这一理论不仅已成为中国人民的财富，而且已成为亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民的财富。”
    《先锋报》说，“毛泽东说过，人民战争的特点是，在人民战争中，人民发展自己的力量，加强自己的力量，最后压倒在开始时拥有巨大优势的侵略者。这就是目前越南的现实。”
    《先锋报》在谈到美国正在压迫澳大利亚向南越增派仆从军的问题时指出，美国不得不大规模向南越增兵“这个事实本身就证实了他们的失败。美帝国主义出于它自己的世界战略的理由，不愿深深地陷入越南。但是它的侵略行动的规律使它没法选择。它不得不投入更多的军队；它将继续这样干下去，直到最后灭亡为止。”
    《先锋报》说，越南人民的英勇抵抗，正在使澳大利亚人民懂得美帝国主义的侵略本性，正在使他们懂得美帝国主义是世界各国人民的共同敌人，是可以被打败的。它号召加紧反对美帝国主义、争取澳大利亚民族独立的斗争。
    新华社仰光二十五日电　缅甸作家和新闻工作者貌乃温最近在这里对新华社记者说，毛泽东思想是全世界革命人民所拥有的最强大、最锐利的武器，也是全世界革命人民的最高行动准则。
    他满怀激情地说：现在，不仅在中国，而且在其他国家，人民欢呼毛泽东思想，因为毛泽东思想是一切被压迫和被剥削人民的指路明灯。
    貌乃温说：“各国革命者和真正的马列主义者经常学习和运用毛泽东思想。他们爱戴当代最伟大的无产阶级领袖和导师毛泽东”。他说：“一切革命者都认识到毛泽东思想是绝对正确的，伟大的中国和全世界过去和现在发生的事件证明了这一点，将来发生的事件也一定会证明这一点。”貌乃温在谈到毛主席二十年前和美国记者安娜·路易斯·斯特朗的谈话时提出的帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的著名论断时说，毛主席的这个最著名、最英明的论断，是对帝国主义和一切反动派的阶级本性所作的最伟大的、最透彻的分析。它指出了貌似强大的帝国主义和一切反动派的虚弱本质。
    他说：“毛主席对于帝国主义和反动派的这一最深入浅出的剖解，始终鼓励和鼓舞着全世界人民同这些垂死的势力进行斗争。”
