At the invitation of the Japan Socialist Youth League, a ten-member Chinese Youth Cultural Delegation arrived in Tokyo on the evening of August 14.

The chairman of the Japan Socialist Youth League, Fukaoka Hajime, vice-chairman Tachiyama Manabu, and secretary-general Morita Kenji, along with other Japanese friends from various circles, went to the airport to welcome them.

Socialist Party Diet members Kuroda Juman, Hozumi Shichiro, Okada Haruo, and Yamayama Yuzo also went to the airport to welcome them.

Fukaoka Hajime said in his welcome speech: "At a time when U.S. imperialism is escalating its aggression in Vietnam and colluding with the Japanese government to push forward its war policies, we welcome the visit of the Chinese Youth Cultural Delegation to Japan. This is very meaningful for our struggle against U.S. imperialism."

He said, "Last year's first Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival was a success. The Socialist Youth League is actively preparing for this year's second festival in coordination with various circles." He said that the enemy is conducting divisive activities and pouring cold water on our friendly activities, attempting to split our friendship. He urged Japanese youth from all walks of life to be vigilant against this divisive plot. He expressed to the Chinese delegation that the Japanese people and youth fervently hope for Sino-Japanese friendship.

The Chinese Youth Cultural Delegation said that since the Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival is a good thing, we should continue to hold it. At this moment, the entire venue erupted in thunderous applause that lasted for a long time. Socialist Party Diet member Kuroda Juman spoke on behalf of the party at the welcome meeting. The secretary-general of the Japan-China Friendship Association, Miyoshi Kazuo, also spoke.

    社会党国会议员黑田寿男、穗积七郎、冈田春夫、矢山有作等也到机场欢迎。
    深田肇在欢迎词中说：“在美帝国主义加紧扩大越南侵略战争，美帝国主义与日本政府加紧勾结推行战争政策的情况下，我们欢迎中国青年文化代表团访问日本，这对我们反对美帝国主义的斗争是很有意义的。”
    他说：“去年第一次日中友好青年大联欢取得了成功，社会主义青年同盟正在同各界联系积极准备今年的第二次大联欢。”他说，敌人正在对日中友好的活动进行分裂活动和泼冷水，企图分裂我们的友谊。他要求日本各界青年警惕这种分裂阴谋。他向中国代表团表示，日本人民和青年热望日中友好。
    中国青年文化代表团表示，中日青年友好大联欢既然是件好事情，我们就要接着办下去。这时候，全场掌声雷动，经久不息。日本众议院议员黑田寿男代表社会党在欢迎会上讲了话。日中友好协会事务局长三好一也讲了话。
