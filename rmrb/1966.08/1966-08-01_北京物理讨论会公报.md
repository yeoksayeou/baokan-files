The discussion meeting enhanced the solidarity and friendship among scientists from the four continents. The achievements of the meeting demonstrated that the awakened peoples and scientists of the four continents have the resolve, talent, and confidence to master the most advanced science and technology. The meeting held that only by first opposing imperialism and colonialism can the scientific and cultural undertakings of the peoples and masses of the four continents' nations be developed.

	New China News Agency, August 31st: The full text of the bulletin of the 1966 Summer Physics Discussion Meeting of the Beijing Science Discussion Meeting is as follows:

	The 1966 Summer Physics Discussion Meeting of the Beijing Science Discussion Meeting was held in Beijing from July 23rd to 31st, 1966. Scientists from 33 countries and one regional academic organization in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania participated in the discussion meeting, totaling 144 people. The countries and regional academic organizations are: Afghanistan, East African Academy of Sciences, Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Burma, Cambodia, Ceylon, Chile, China, Colombia, Congo (Brazzaville), Ecuador, Guinea, Indonesia, Iraq, Japan, North Korea, Mexico, Morocco, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Tunisia (observer), Uganda, United Arab Republic, Uruguay, and Vietnam.

	The meeting received 99 academic papers. These papers covered a wide range of fields in physics. The papers from various countries presented many unique insights, especially in the areas of elementary particles, nuclear physics, and solid-state physics, where there were pioneering works, new theories were proposed, and many previously unexplained experimental phenomena were clarified. The physicists from various countries also exchanged valuable experiences in physics education. They also exchanged many beneficial experiences in the integration of theory and practice, scientific research, teaching, and production. After heated discussions, the participants learned from each other and achieved common progress.

	The meeting promoted the spirit of democratic consultation and active cooperation, enhancing the solidarity and friendship among scientists from the four continents. The participants believed that this discussion meeting is of great significance in promoting new developments in physics.

	The achievements of the meeting demonstrated: The awakened peoples and scientists of the four continents have the resolve, talent, and confidence to master the most advanced science and technology. The meeting held that only by first opposing imperialism and old and new colonialism can the scientific and cultural undertakings of the peoples and masses of the four continents' nations be developed.

	To further strengthen the solidarity, friendship, and academic exchanges among scientists from Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania, the meeting hopes that scientists from the four continents will make further efforts, strengthen bilateral and multilateral contacts, and contribute to the convening of the 1968 Beijing Science Discussion Meeting.

    北京物理讨论会公报
    讨论会增进了四大洲科学家的团结和友谊。讨论会的成就表明，四大洲觉醒了的人民和科学家，有志气、有才能、有信心掌握最先进的科学和技术。讨论会认为，只有首先反帝反殖，才能使四大洲各国民族的、人民大众的科学文化事业得以发展
    新华社三十一日讯　北京科学讨论会一九六六年暑期物理讨论会公报，全文如下：
    北京科学讨论会一九六六年暑期物理讨论会，于一九六六年七月二十三日至三十一日在北京举行，参加讨论会的有来自亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和大洋洲三十三个国家和一个地区性学术组织的科学家一百四十四人。这些国家和地区性学术组织是：阿富汗、东非科学院、阿尔及利亚、阿根廷、澳大利亚、缅甸、柬埔寨、锡兰、智利、中国、哥伦比亚、刚果（布）、厄瓜多尔、几内亚、印度尼西亚、伊拉克、日本、朝鲜、墨西哥、摩洛哥、尼泊尔、尼日利亚、巴基斯坦、塞拉勒窝内、苏丹、叙利亚、坦桑尼亚、突尼斯（观察员）、乌干达、阿联、乌拉圭和越南等。
    讨论会收到九十九篇学术论文。这些论文广泛涉及物理学的很多领域。各国科学家的论文，提出了许多各自独到的见解，特别在基本粒子、原子核物理和固体物理方面，都有开创性的工作，提出了新的理论，弄清了许多过去未能解释的实验现象。各国物理学家还交流了他们在物理教学方面的切身的宝贵经验。在理论与实践相结合、科学研究、教学和生产相结合等方面也交流了许多有益的经验。与会者经过热烈的讨论，互相学习，得到了共同提高。
    讨论会发扬了民主协商、积极合作的精神，增进了四大洲科学家之间的团结和友谊。与会者相信，这次讨论会对于促进物理学的新发展具有重要的意义。
    讨论会的成就表明：四大洲觉醒了的人民和科学家，有志气、有才能、有信心掌握最先进的科学和技术。讨论会认为，只有首先反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义，才能使四大洲各国民族的、人民大众的科学文化事业得以发展。
    为了进一步加强亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和大洋洲各国科学家的团结友谊和学术交流，讨论会希望四大洲的科学家进一步努力，加强双边和多边的接触，为一九六八年北京科学讨论会的召开，作出贡献。
