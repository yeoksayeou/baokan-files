One day, I visited the Second Company of the Engineering Corps of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army. This is a company that has consecutively maintained the title of "Four Good" for four years. Except for the duty officer, there was no one in the company headquarters or the soldiers' dormitories. I asked the duty officer, "Where did the troops go?" He replied, "Today is the time for agricultural and sideline production, everyone went to the rice fields on the west side of the target range!"

When I arrived at the rice field embankment, the comrades of the Second Company were weeding the rice seedlings. Everyone was wearing shorts and barefoot, working like experienced rice farmers from the south. I couldn't help but praise, "Each one of you is like an old farmer!" Company Commander Wang Ruidian laughed heartily and said, "Actually, many comrades only learned to farm rice fields after joining the army."

Take the quartermaster Zhang Zhaoqin, for example! Before enlisting, he was always studying in school and had never done farm work. After joining the army, as soon as he picked up a hoe to till the soil, his hands quickly became covered with blisters; when he bent down to transplant seedlings, after a while his waist ached so much he couldn't straighten up. The company party branch organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's "On the Army's Production Self-Sufficiency and the Importance of the Two Great Movements of Rectification and Production" and other articles. Zhang Zhaoqin realized the importance of participating in production. Through hard training, he became a production expert who can "dig hard soil without blisters and carry a hundred pounds without feeling the weight."

After hearing the company commander's introduction, I said, "Our army has truly become an agricultural university!" The soldiers heard this and said that my statement was not comprehensive. Some young people said, "After enlisting, the company helped us establish the thought of wholeheartedly serving the people. The army is a 'political academy.'" One comrade said, "As soon as I put on my military uniform, the company helped me train with the mindset of facing the enemy, teaching me a set of skills to defeat the enemy. I say the army is a 'military academy.'" A young man chimed in, "Since I came to the Second Company, I was taught how to use ideology to guide technology, learning to sail, build bridges, construct houses, and repair roads. In my opinion, it's simply an 'engineering academy.'"

After listening to everyone's various "academies," Political Instructor Xu Jinfeng summed up with a concluding tone, "Each of our growths, every bit of knowledge we learn, every achievement we make, is all the result of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of our ideological transformation and victory. In my opinion, the army is a great school for actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought." The soldiers heard this and all clapped and laughed, saying, "Right, absolutely right!"

The young comrades who enlisted last year have a deep understanding of this. At that time, although the young men were all full of enthusiasm to join the army, each had their own ideals. Some dreamed of soaring in the blue sky of the motherland in a silver eagle; some wanted to break waves in the vast sea of the motherland in a warship; Zhang Guozhong's aspiration was to be an anti-aircraft artillery soldier. As for Cui Xiaoguang, he was an electrician in the production team and wanted to learn wireless communication in the army.

The company party branch, in response to the active thoughts of all the new recruits, organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and introduced the model deeds of old soldier Zhu Xueyi, who actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works and was a model of serving the people. Following that, they conducted a remembrance of bitterness and a situation education. This deeply educated the new soldiers, who said, "Chairman Mao teaches us to wholeheartedly serve the people, but we want to be this or that, which is half-hearted. We must not forget the bitterness of the past and think of the three-fifths of the world's people who are still oppressed and not yet liberated." They actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, further raising their ideological awareness. In the first stone-breaking and sand-pulling exercise, Zhang Guozhong performed excellently. Later, he was transferred to be a driver. He took Lei Feng as his example, first armed his mind with Mao Zedong Thought, then learned the technology, and quickly became a "Five Good" soldier. Not long ago, he was proudly admitted into the Communist Party of China.

Soldier Bai Heguo, who enlisted in March of the previous year, couldn't even write his own name. After studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," he felt that every sentence was the truth and wanted to read more of Chairman Mao's works. But since he was illiterate, what should he do? After studying "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," he decided to "move the mountains with determination and conquer the mountain of culture." From then on, he spent several hours each day copying Chairman Mao's "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and two other articles. Studying Chairman Mao's works diligently raised his political awareness and ideological level. He used to watch movies just for the fun of it, but now he analyzes and judges every movie he watches with Chairman Mao's perspective, distinguishing between good and bad. Bai Heguo told me, "Last year, I watched the bad movie 'Drafting Soldiers' and laughed so hard my stomach hurt; this year, after arming my mind with Mao Zedong Thought, watching 'Drafting Soldiers' again made me so angry my stomach exploded." Not long ago, he watched the bad movie "Two Families," and he told me in great anger, "I think 'Two Families' is a poisonous weed that defames our poor and lower-middle peasants! Chairman Mao said, 'Without the poor peasants, there would be no revolution. If we deny them, we deny the revolution. If we attack them, we attack the revolution.' The director and screenwriter of the movie deliberately portray a revolutionary class—the poor peasants—as people who take the capitalist road by any means, isn't this distorting the poor peasants!"

Now, most of the illiterate soldiers in the Second Company can write letters and study Chairman Mao's works on their own.

Chairman Mao said that the People's Liberation Army should be a great school. This great school should learn politics, military affairs, culture, and engage in agricultural and sideline production, and also operate some small and medium-sized factories to produce some products needed by the army and products for equal exchange with the state. This great school should also engage in mass work, participate in the socialist education movement in factories and villages; after the socialist education movement is over, there is always mass work to be done, so that the army and the people are always united; it should also participate in the cultural revolution to criticize the bourgeoisie at any time. In this way, military learning, military agriculture, military industry, and military-civilian integration can all be combined. From the Second Company, we can see: this army, personally created by Chairman Mao, is advancing in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao. Our soldiers will forever march forward under the red flag in the great school of Mao Zedong Thought!

### 真是一座大学校——解放军某部工兵二连访问记

    真是一座大学校
    ——解放军某部工兵二连访问记
    张谋厚
    一天，我来到解放军某部工兵二连。这是一个连续保持了四年“四好”称号的光荣连队。除值班员外，连部和战士宿舍都没有人。我问值班员：“部队哪儿去了？”他说：“今天是农副业生产时间，全到靶挡西侧的稻田地去了！”
    我来到稻田埂的时候，工兵二连的同志们正在给禾苗除草。大伙儿穿着裤衩，光着脚，干起来都像南方的种稻老手那样能干。我禁不住夸道：“真是个个都像老农民了！”连长王瑞田笑呵呵地说：“其实许多同志是到部队以后才学会种稻田的。”
    就说司务长张兆麒吧！入伍前他一直在学校念书，从来没有干过农活。来到部队后，一拿铁锨翻地，两只手很快就布满了血泡；弯下身子去插秧，插一会儿腰就痠得直不起来。连队党支部组织大伙儿学习毛主席的《论军队生产自给，兼论整风和生产两大运动的重要性》等文章。张兆麒认识到参加生产的重要意义。经过刻苦锻炼，成为一个“手刨硬地不起泡，肩挑百斤压不着”的生产能手。
    听了连长的介绍，我说：“咱们部队简直成了一座农业大学了！”战士们一听，都说我讲的不全面。有些年青人说：“入伍以后，连队帮助我们树立了全心全意为人民服务的思想，部队是个‘政治学院’。”有位同志却说：“我一穿上军衣，连队就帮助我学会带着敌情去练兵，使我学到一套杀敌的本领。我说部队是个‘军事学院’。”一个小青年接茬儿说：“自从我到工兵二连，就教我怎样以思想统帅技术，使我学会了开船、架桥、盖房、修路，依我说，干脆就叫它‘工程学院’吧。”
    指导员许金文听大伙儿说了那么多个“院”以后，带着总结的口吻说：“咱们每个人的成长，每学到一点东西，每取得一点成绩，全都是活学活用毛主席著作的结果。毛泽东思想是咱们改造思想、取得胜利的灵魂。依我说，部队是一所活学活用毛泽东思想的大学校。”战士们一听，全都拍手笑道：“对，一百个对！”
    去年入伍的青年同志对这一点体会得很深刻。那时，小伙子们虽说都满怀热情来当兵，可是各人有各人的理想。有的向往驾驶着银鹰在祖国的蓝天上翱翔；有的想开着军舰在祖国的大海上破浪驰骋；张国忠的志愿是当个高射炮兵。崔小广呢？他在生产队里是个电工，他很想到部队学习无线电。
    连队党支部针对全连新兵的活思想，组织大家学习毛主席的《为人民服务》，介绍了老战士朱学义活学活用毛主席著作、甘当人民勤务员的模范事迹。紧接着，又进行了忆苦教育和形势教育。这使新战士受到了很深刻的教育，他们说：“毛主席教导我们要全心全意为人民服务，可我们想当这、想当那，这是半心半意。我们不能忘记过去的苦，要想到世界上三分之二还没有解放的被压迫人民。”他们活学活用毛主席著作，使自己的思想觉悟进一步得到提高。在第一次参加打石头、拉沙子中，张国忠一直干得很出色。后来，他被调去当司机。他以雷锋为榜样，先用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，再学习技术，很快成为一个“五好”战士，不久前光荣地加入了中国共产党。
    战士白合国前年三月入伍时，连自己的名字都不会写。学了《为人民服务》，觉得句句是真理，很想读更多的毛主席著作。可是自己是个文盲，怎么办？学了《愚公移山》以后，他决心“拿出移山志，攻下文化山”。从那时起，他每天都要用几个小时来抄写毛主席的《为人民服务》等三篇文章。刻苦学习毛主席著作使他提高了政治觉悟和思想水平。他过去看电影只看热闹，现在每看一部影片，都用毛主席的观点去分析判断，识别是香花还是毒草。白合国告诉我：“去年看了坏电影《抓壮丁》，笑得肚皮痛；今年用毛泽东思想武装了头脑，再看《抓壮丁》，就气得肚皮炸。”不久前，他看了坏影片《两家人》，他十分气愤地对我说：“我看《两家人》是一株毒草，它污辱咱们贫下中农！毛主席说：‘没有贫农，便没有革命。若否认他们，便是否认革命。若打击他们，便是打击革命。’电影的编导者硬是把一个革命的阶级——贫农，写成了不择手段走资本主义道路的人，这不是歪曲贫农吗！”
    现在，二连的绝大部分文盲战士都能写信和自学毛主席著作了。
    毛主席说，人民解放军应该是一个大学校。这个大学校，要学政治，学军事，学文化，又能从事农副业生产，又能办一些中小工厂，生产自己需要的若干产品和与国家等价交换的产品。这个大学校，又能从事群众工作，参加工厂、农村的社会主义教育运动；社会主义教育运动完了，随时都有群众工作可做，使军民永远打成一片；又要随时参加批判资产阶级的文化革命斗争。这样，军学、军农、军工、军民这几项都可以兼起来。从工兵二连，我们可以看到：这支毛主席亲手缔造起来的解放军部队，正在遵循着毛主席所指引的方向前进。我们的战士将永远在毛泽东思想的大学校里高举红旗向前迈进！
