At a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is deeply unfolding across the nation, the Party Central Committee has made a very wise and timely decision to publish the decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, clearly outlining the guidelines, tasks, and policies of the Cultural Revolution. I deeply feel that the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao understand the revolutionary aspirations of the masses the best, trust the revolutionary power of the masses the most, and are the best at following the mass line. This decision is written with Mao Zedong Thought, embodying the most thorough mass line, the most thorough class line, and embodying the most thorough revolutionary spirit of our Party.

The Party Central Committee's decision states: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution can only be a movement where the masses liberate themselves, and it is not permissible to use any method of substitution or replacement." This shows that the Party and Chairman Mao fully believe that the vast masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers harbor immense socialist enthusiasm; fully believe that the vast masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are conscious, wise, capable, and powerful. As long as the revolutionary masses grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they can sweep away all ghosts and monsters, thoroughly bury all old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits; establish new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits. In a word, only the Party and Chairman Mao fully believe that the vast masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are the true heroes.

In leading revolutionary struggles, Chairman Mao has always believed in the masses, fully mobilized the masses, and launched a surging revolutionary mass movement. The waves of the Chinese revolutionary mass movement have destroyed the invading armies of Japanese imperialism, overthrown the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek regime, shattered the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, and demolished the feudal and capitalist systems. Today, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we have launched an even greater mass movement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, thoroughly overthrowing those in power who are taking the capitalist road, thoroughly criticizing bourgeois reactionary ideas, thoroughly destroying all superstructures that do not conform to the socialist economic base, and thoroughly purging all ideological remnants of the exploiting classes.

Long live the revolutionary mass movement!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

　　革命大字报选革命的群众运动万岁
    正当全国无产阶级文化大革命深入开展的时刻，党中央非常英明、非常及时地公布了关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定，非常清楚地讲了文化大革命的方针、任务、政策。我深深感到，党中央和毛主席最了解群众的革命心愿，最相信群众的革命力量，最善于走群众路线。这个决定是用毛泽东思想写成的，它体现了最彻底的群众路线，最彻底的阶级路线，体现了我们党最彻底的革命精神。
    党中央决定中说：“无产阶级文化大革命，只能是群众自己解放自己，不能采用任何包办代替的办法。”这说明党和毛主席充分相信在广大工农兵群众中蕴藏着极大的社会主义的积极性；充分相信广大工农兵群众有觉悟，有智慧，有本领，有力量，只要革命群众掌握了毛泽东思想，就能够横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，彻底埋葬一切旧思想，旧文化，旧风俗，旧习惯；树立新思想，新文化，新风俗，新习惯。一句话，只有党和毛主席最充分地相信广大工农兵群众是真正的英雄。
    毛主席在领导革命斗争的实践中，一贯地相信群众，充分地发动群众，掀起汹涌澎湃的革命群众运动。中国革命群众运动的浪潮摧毁了日本帝国主义的侵略军队，摧毁了蒋家王朝的反动统治，摧毁了美帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，摧毁了封建制度和资本主义制度。今天，我们在党中央和毛主席的领导下，掀起了更大的无产阶级文化大革命的群众运动，彻底斗倒走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底批判资产阶级的反动思想，彻底摧毁一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑，彻底肃清一切剥削阶级的意识形态。
    革命的群众运动万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
