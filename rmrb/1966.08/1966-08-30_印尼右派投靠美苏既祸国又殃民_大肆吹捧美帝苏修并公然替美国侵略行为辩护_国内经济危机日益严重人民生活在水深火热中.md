The Indonesian right-wing military regime's Minister of Propaganda, Diah, recently gave a speech openly defending the aggressive actions of U.S. imperialism, claiming that foreign military bases in Asia are necessary. The Indonesian newspaper *Tiga Silaturrahmi* on August 17 reported these fallacies, stating that U.S. and British military bases and troops in Asia are used to "contain" the supposed "communist threat" from China. The newspaper also openly expressed that U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam and the fascist terror rule by the Indonesian reactionaries, which harms the people, are beneficial. It said that if the United States collapses in Vietnam, then Indonesia's position will not be as advantageous as it is now.

A commentary broadcast by the Jakarta Radio on August 18 did not hide its gratitude towards U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership for supporting the Indonesian right-wing military regime. The radio station praised U.S. Secretary of State Rusk's lies about the United States "respecting Indonesia's independence and active policy," and simultaneously praised the article published by the Soviet Communist Party's official newspaper *Pravda* on August 17, marking Indonesia's 21st anniversary of independence. The Jakarta Radio said that one should "welcome" the views of Washington and Moscow on Indonesia's government policies with a "respectful attitude."

According to a report from New China News Agency, the economic crisis in Indonesia under the right-wing military regime is becoming increasingly severe.

Reports indicate that since December 1965, industrial production in Indonesia has been almost completely stagnant, with those factories that are partially operational only achieving 10 to 15 percent of their production capacity. The newspaper *Pancasila* reported, "The number of unemployed in Indonesia is approximately 3 million, and the number of underemployed is about 12 million."

Due to the sharp decline in production, Indonesia's export volume has significantly decreased. This year's planned export target was $400 million, but in the first quarter, only $60 million was achieved. The decrease in exports has led to a depletion of foreign exchange reserves. According to the British magazine *The Economist*, Indonesia's foreign debt has reached $2.5 billion. Foreign exchange reserves are practically zero. Despite the Indonesian right-wing military regime sending a delegation to beg for "aid" from U.S. imperialism and its accomplices, so far, they have only received less than $100 million. This is a mere drop in the bucket and is ineffective.

The British magazine *The Economist* also reported that from September 1965 to March 1966, over a six-month period, the cost of living index in Indonesia increased sixfold. Since March of this year, the cost of living index has continued to rise. The report states, "With inflation and political turmoil, Indonesia's currency—the rupiah—by the end of 1965, had already become less valuable than the paper it was printed on."

Inflation and soaring prices have plunged the Indonesian people into a state of misery. The right-wing military regime's directly controlled newspaper *Berita Yudha* reported as early as late May that the average salary of middle and upper-level civil servants in Indonesia is approximately 200 new rupiahs, with the highest salary in private enterprises being 1,500 new rupiahs. However, a family of five needs 3,100 new rupiahs just for living expenses each month. The reactionary "Indonesian Student Action Union" (KAMI) organ *KAMI Daily* revealed in early July that in the western part of the Lesser Sunda Islands alone, 30,000 people have starved to death due to lack of food.

The economic crisis in Indonesia is extremely severe. Even in the fertile island of Sumatra, industrial production is almost completely stagnant. This emaciated oil worker in Palembang struggles to work in the dark workshop.

    印尼右派投靠美苏既祸国又殃民
    大肆吹捧美帝苏修并公然替美国侵略行为辩护
    国内经济危机日益严重人民生活在水深火热中
    新华社二十八日讯  雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派军人政权的宣传部长迪亚最近发表演说，公然替美帝国主义的侵略行为辩护，说外国在亚洲建立军事基地是有必要的。印度尼西亚《三大方针报》八月十七日报道了他的这种谬论，并且说什么这是因为美国和英国在亚洲的军事基地和驻军是用来“遏制”来自中国的所谓“共产主义危险”的。这家报纸还公然表示美帝国主义侵略越南，对印度尼西亚反动派实行法西斯恐怖统治、残害人民有好处。它说，如果美国在越南崩溃了，那么印度尼西亚的地位将不会像现在那样有利。
    雅加达电台八月十八日广播的一篇评论，毫不掩饰地表示感谢美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团对印度尼西亚右派军人政权的支持。这家电台赞扬美国国务卿腊斯克关于美国“尊重印度尼西亚独立和积极的政策”的谎言，同时赞扬苏共中央机关报《真理报》八月十七日就印度尼西亚独立二十一周年发表的文章。雅加达电台说，应当以“尊重的心情”，“欢迎”华盛顿和莫斯科对印度尼西亚政府政策的看法。
    据新华社讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派军人政权统治下的印度尼西亚经济危机日趋严重。
    据报道，自从一九六五年十二月以来，印度尼西亚的工业生产几乎处于完全停滞的状态，那些部分开工的工厂的生产率也只达到百分之十到十五。《建国五项原则之火报》说，“印度尼西亚失业人数达三百万左右，半失业人数约达一千二百万人。”
    由于生产急剧下降，印度尼西亚的出口量大为减少。今年计划的出口指标是四亿美元，但在第一季度只完成六千万美元。出口下降，造成了库存外汇枯竭。据英国《经济学家》周刊报道，印度尼西亚的外债达到了二十五亿美元。外汇储备实际上已等于零。尽管印尼右派军人政权派代表团向美帝国主义及其帮凶乞讨“援助”，但到目前为止，实际到手的还不到一亿美元。杯水车薪，无济于事。
    英国《经济学家》周刊还报道说，从一九六五年九月到今年三月底的六个月中，印度尼西亚的生活费用指数上升六倍。从今年三月以后生活费用指数又继续不断上升。报道说，“随着通货膨胀和政治动乱，印度尼西亚的货币——盾——的币值，到一九六五年年底时，已经比用来印制纸币的纸张更不值钱。”
    通货膨胀，物价飞涨，使印度尼西亚广大人民生活在水深火热之中。右派军人政权直接控制的《战斗报》，早在五月底就报道说，印度尼西亚中上层公务人员的平均工资约新币二百盾，在私营企业工作的最高工资为一千五百新盾，但一个五口之家光是生活费每月就需要三千一百新盾。反动的“印度尼西亚大学生统一行动组织（简称卡米）”的机关报《卡米日报》在七月初透露，仅仅是在小巽他群岛的西部，就有三万人由于缺粮而饿死。（附图片）
    印度尼西亚经济危机十分严重，甚至在富饶的苏门答腊岛，工业生产几乎处于完全停滞的状态。这个骨瘦如柴的巨港石油工人，在黑暗的车间里挣扎着卖命。
