A group of soldiers and officers from the People's Liberation Army, after listening to the broadcast of the bulletin, could not contain their excitement and quickly put together a cultural performance to sing to the crowd. They became:

The "Bulletin" Propaganda Team on the Train

On the morning of the 14th, it was the second day after the publication of the bulletin of the 11th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party. As the 312th passenger train from Zhengzhou to Pingdingshan Coal Mine passed through the Luohe station, a group of soldiers boarded the train. These were part of the troops stationed in Pingdingshan. They had just attended the conference of active participants in the study of Chairman Mao's works and were returning to their base by train.

They entered the carriage, took a brief rest, and after a quick discussion, immediately started beating drums and striking bamboo clappers on the train to propagate the bulletin of the Party Central Committee to the passengers. First, two soldiers came to the middle of the carriage, beating drums and reciting a dialogue: "Drums and gongs resound, firecrackers explode, the nation rejoices, the people are happy. Our beloved leader Chairman Mao personally presided over the 11th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party and issued a bulletin! We cheer for the bulletin as the steering wheel, the guiding light, the marching order. We firmly support and implement the bulletin. We are filled with boundless love, respect, and admiration for Chairman Mao, cheering for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years..."

Following this, eight more soldiers performed "The Highest Directive Comes Down" and "The People's Liberation Army is a Revolutionary School," enthusiastically praising the great Mao Zedong Thought. As the soldiers' singing ended, the carriage immediately erupted in thunderous applause. The passengers discussed eagerly: The People's Liberation Army is truly the good soldiers taught by Chairman Mao, a fighting team, a production team, and also a propaganda team!

Originally, this group of revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, after hearing the broadcast of the bulletin, could not contain their excitement. They had already planned to propagate along the way to the crowd on their return journey. On August 14th, they used the brief waiting time in Luohe to quickly put together the lyrics, and as soon as they boarded the train, they began to propagate to the passengers.

    一批解放军指战员听了公报广播后，抑制不住内心的激动，很快编出文艺节目向群众演唱，他们成了：
　　列车上的“公报”宣传队
    十四日上午，正是党的八届十一中全会公报公布的第二天，从郑州开往平顶山煤矿的三百一十二次客车经过漯河车站时，上来了一些解放军同志。这是驻平顶山的某部队的一部分指战员。他们刚出席了学习毛主席著作积极分子代表会，由这里乘车回驻地。
    他们走进车厢，刚歇下脚，相互商量了一阵，就马上在列车上打起锣鼓，敲起竹板，向旅客们宣传党中央的公报。先是两位战士来到车厢中间，敲着锣鼓说起了对口词：“锣鼓喧天，鞭炮齐鸣，举国欢欣，万民欢腾。我们亲爱的领袖毛主席亲自主持的党的八届十一中全会发表了公报！我们欢呼公报是方向盘，是指路灯，是进军号，我们对公报坚决拥护，对公报坚决执行。我们满怀对毛主席的无限热爱，无限敬仰，无限崇拜，欢呼战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁，万万岁……”
    随后，又有八个战士一起演出了《最高指示传下来》、《解放军是个革命化的大学校》等节目，热情赞颂伟大的毛泽东思想。战士们的演唱声刚落，车厢里立即爆发出雷鸣般的掌声。旅客们纷纷议论：解放军真正是毛主席教导的好战士，既是战斗队，又是生产队，也是宣传队！
    原来，这批用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，听到公报的广播后，抑制不住内心的激动，他们早就商量好要在归途中沿路向群众作宣传。八月十四日，他们利用在漯河候车的短暂时间，你一言我一句，匆匆编出了演唱词，上了火车就向旅客宣传起来。
