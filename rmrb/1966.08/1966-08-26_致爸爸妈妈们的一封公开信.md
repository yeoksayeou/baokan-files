Parents:

	Your children have all risen up to make revolution, to "rebel," and to join the Red Guards! Everyone calls you old revolutionaries. But we want to tell you something: among the old revolutionaries, some are just going through the motions of revolution! How long do you plan to keep this up? Endless worries and countless restrictions are in your minds and on your bodies. Where has the heroic spirit of your past battles gone? Where is the righteous indignation you once had against class enemies? Seeing you like this now, we children feel very sad. Think about it: how many of your comrades-in-arms fell on the snowy mountains and grasslands? How many were martyred on the enemy's execution grounds? How many died from overwork? Remembering these things, how many of you have shed tears in secret? "Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the people's interests, making every living person feel sad when thinking of them. Can we still have personal interests that we cannot sacrifice? Can we still have mistakes that we cannot abandon?" Don't you feel ashamed? Don't you feel danger? Don't you feel sad? Don't you want to keep living like this? "So many things, all urgent; the heavens turn, time presses. Ten thousand years is too long, we strive for every moment." It's time for you to rebel! You are our parents, but "never forget, we are all children of the people, all raised by the laboring people with their blood and sweat! Never forget this point. Always remember that the laboring people are our fathers, our mothers." If you forget the laboring people, forget your fallen comrades, forget the revolution, you might become revisionists. We will rebel against you! Who says children can't rebel against their parents! If you become revisionists, we will rebel against you, rebel to the end!

	Over the past decade or so, some of you have lived in luxury, staying in offices for long periods. Your "capital" has long been spent; your revolutionary spirit has long been dulled. How far have you drifted from the laboring people? Get out of the office, into the great waves of the mass movement, change your minds, wash away the dirt on your bodies, infuse new blood, and completely change your spiritual state. Otherwise, you will be eliminated in this great revolution.

	Remember the past, when you followed Chairman Mao, fighting south and north, and won the people's country. Look at today, Chairman Mao in his green military uniform and red armband, leading us onto the battlefield of the Cultural Revolution. We are following. And you? Do you want to fall behind? Dear parents, respected old revolutionaries, you must always keep your revolutionary spirit! Old revolutionaries face new problems with two paths: one is to solve them with the people, and the old revolutionaries become young; the other is to separate from the people, stumble on new problems, and the old revolutionaries truly become old and will perish. You wrote your brilliant first half of life with your blood and sweat. We sincerely hope that today, you can still closely follow Chairman Mao and not lose your revolutionary integrity in this great proletarian Cultural Revolution.

### 致爸爸妈妈们的一封公开信

    致爸爸妈妈们的一封公开信爸爸妈妈们：
    儿女们都起来闹革命了，都“造反”了，都加入红卫兵了！大家都称你们为老革命。但是，我们要告诉你们一句：在老革命中，有的人是在混革命！你们想混到哪天才到头呢？无穷的忧虑，无数的框框，缠在你们的脑子里，套在你们的身上。当年血战沙场的英雄气概，横眉怒视阶级敌人的凛然大义，现在都到哪里去了呢？看见你们现在这个样子，孩儿们都感到很痛心。你们好好想想吧：你们的亲密战友有多少倒在雪山上，草地里，有多少英勇就义在敌人的刑场上，又有多少因积劳成疾而不幸与我们长辞。想起这些，你们中间曾经有多少人暗暗落泪。“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？”难道你们不觉得可耻吗？难道你们不觉得危险吗？难道你们自己也不感到痛心吗？难道你们还想这样混下去吗？“多少事，从来急；天地转，光阴迫。一万年太久，只争朝夕。”到了你们起来造反的时候了！你们是我们的父母，但是，“永远不要忘记，我们都是人民的儿子，都是劳动人民用血汗把我们养大的！千万不要忘记这点。千万要记得劳动人民是我们的父亲，是我们的母亲。”你们要是忘记了劳动人民，忘记了你们牺牲了的战友，忘记了革命，你们就可能变成修正主义分子了。我们就要造你们的反！谁说儿子不能造老子的反！你们“修”了，我们就要造你们的反，造反有理，造反到底！
    十几年来，你们当中有的人养尊处优，长期蹲在办公室里，你们的“资本”早就花光了；你们的革命锐气早就磨钝了，你们和劳动人民相差何止十万八千里！走出办公室，到群众运动的大风大浪中来，换下你们的头脑，洗掉你们身上的污垢，灌进新鲜的血液，彻底改变你们这种精神状态。不然，在这场大革命中就要被淘汰了。
    想当年，你们跟着毛主席转战南北，打出了人民的江山。看今朝，毛主席身穿绿军装，臂戴红袖章，又带着我们冲向文化大革命的战场。我们跟上了。你们呢？难道你们要掉队吗？亲爱的父母们，敬爱的老革命，你们千万要永葆革命的青春呵！老革命遇到新问题，有两条道路：一条是和人民群众在一道解决它，老革命就年轻了；一条是脱离人民群众，在新问题上跌跤子，这样老革命就真要老了，就要完蛋了。你们用你们的鲜血和汗水写出了鲜红的前半生，我们更衷心地希望在今天，还能紧紧地跟上毛主席，在这场无产阶级文化大革命中不失无产阶级的革命晚节。　    中直某机关红卫兵
