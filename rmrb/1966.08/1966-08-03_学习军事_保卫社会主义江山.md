Chairman Mao has called on us to implement the policy of universal military training, allowing us, the poor and lower-middle peasants who have been exploited and oppressed for generations, to not only till the land but also to take up arms, become militia members, study military affairs, and defend our socialist homeland. Through the militia organization, we can better learn from the People's Liberation Army, be fearless of hardships and sacrifices, dedicate ourselves to the revolution and the people, and become thoroughly revolutionary and combat-ready individuals. The significance of this is truly profound.

In the past, we farmers only focused on farming and living our small lives. After studying Chairman Mao's works, we understand that there are still classes and class struggles in a socialist society, and that reactionary elements will not fall unless you fight them. In the past, we thought that fighting was the job of the People's Liberation Army. This way of thinking is wrong. This is because we did not connect our own liberation with the need to hold guns in our hands. In the past, we were scattered and disorganized, and it would take half a day for everyone to gather for a meeting. Now we understand that to carry out the revolution and defend the homeland, we must be armed.

In militia activities, by continuously spreading Mao Zedong Thought among the masses, we have changed people's spiritual outlook and transformed spiritual strength into tremendous material force. In our brigade, during times of class struggle and production struggles, whenever there are urgent and difficult tasks, the militia always plays a leading role.

In the summer of 1964, there were continuous heavy rains. One night, the river water threatened to overflow the banks. After the danger occurred, all members of our militia company rushed to the scene and joined the rescue battle. At that time, there were several breaches in the dike. In this critical moment, Zhao Yongsheng and more than ten other core militia members, without regard for their own lives, jumped into the river and used their bodies to block the breaches. Kong Qingshan used to be a timid person, but through militia training, his revolutionary will was tempered. During the rescue, his thigh was cut, but he still insisted on fighting in the water. When everyone called for him to go ashore for treatment, he said, "I am a militia member, and I should be like the PLA, not retreating from the battlefield with minor injuries." The militia's fearless revolutionary spirit moved the rescuers, and everyone fought for two days and two nights, building a dike that was more than ten li long, one meter high, and one meter wide, blocking the flood and saving the lives and property of more than a hundred households, and protecting the crops.

The tenth squad's militia platoon leader, Chen He, used to think that "farmers only earn work points." After becoming a core militia member, he studied Chairman Mao's works diligently, raised his class consciousness, and broadened his horizons, completely transforming into a new person. In 1964, once he saw that a mule in the production team was sick, the veterinarian said it had to be kept in a warm room and treated with traditional Chinese medicine to recover. He took the sick mule home, worked in the fields during the day, and treated the mule with medicine at night. He cared for the mule for a month until it recovered, and then returned it to the production team. The production team offered him labor compensation, but he firmly refused.

The changes in the militia have made us deeply realize: Chairman Mao teaches us that while focusing on agriculture, we should also study military affairs, politics, and culture, which has profound significance. For us farmers, we not only need to be able to farm but also to learn how to fight. Our militia organization must take the PLA as an example and gradually transform farmers into all-round developed communist new people. With revolutionary people, we can defeat any enemy, overcome any difficulty, complete any task, and create any miracle.

    学习军事　保卫社会主义江山
    辽宁省昌图县宝力公社马场大队民兵连长　张祥
    毛主席号召我们实行全民皆兵，让我们这些祖祖辈辈受剥削受压迫的贫下中农，除了种地以外，还要拿起枪杆子，当民兵，学军事，保卫自己的社会主义江山。让我们通过民兵组织，更好地向解放军学习，一不怕苦，二不怕死，一心为革命，一心为人民，成为非常革命化，非常战斗化的彻底革命的人。这个意义真是太深远了。
    过去我们庄稼人只管种地，过小日子，学习毛主席著作后，我们懂得了社会主义社会里还有阶级和阶级斗争，懂得了反动的东西你不打它就不会倒的道理。过去我们认为打仗是解放军的事情，这种想法不对。这是因为我们没有把自己的翻身同手中要掌握枪杆子联系起来。过去散散漫漫，开个会老半天也到不齐，现在懂得了搞革命，保江山，必须武装起来。
    在民兵活动中，因为不断地把毛泽东思想灌输到群众中去，改变了人们的精神面貌，使精神力量转化为巨大的物质力量。我们大队在阶级斗争和生产斗争中，有了紧急和困难的任务，民兵都发挥了突击作用。
    一九六四年夏天，连日暴雨。一天夜里，河水要出槽。险情发生以后，我们民兵连的全体同志就及时赶到现场，投入了抢险战斗。当时，堤坝有几处决口，在万分危急的时刻，赵永生等十几名基干民兵，不顾生命危险，跳进河里用身体堵住了缺口。孔庆山过去是一个胆小怕事的人，在民兵训练中锻炼了他的革命意志，在抢险时，他的大腿被划破了一条口子，仍然坚持在水中战斗。大家叫他上岸包扎，他说：“我是民兵，应该象解放军那样轻伤不下火线。”民兵们的这种大无畏的革命精神，感动了抢险的群众，大家奋战了两天两夜，修筑了长达十多华里、一米高、一米宽的土坝，挡住了洪水，保住了一百多户社员的生命财产，保住了庄稼。
    第十排民兵排长陈和，过去认为“庄稼人就是挣工分”，自私观念比较重。当了基干民兵以后，他努力学习毛主席著作，提高了阶级觉悟，开阔了眼界，完全变成象另外一个人了。一九六四年，有一次，他看到生产队里一头骡子病了，兽医说，要放在暖屋里，用中药慢慢熏才能治好。他就把病骡牵到自己家去，白天下地干活，夜里给病骡熏药。他精心照顾了一个来月，直到把病骡治好，才送回生产队。生产队给他劳动报酬，他坚决不要。
    民兵的这些变化，使我们深深体会到：毛主席教导我们，以农为主，也要兼学军事、政治、文化，有深远的意义。对我们农民来说，不但要能种地，还要学会打仗。我们民兵组织，一定要以解放军为榜样，把农民逐渐改造成为全面发展的共产主义新人。有了革命化的人，我们就什么敌人都能打倒，什么困难都能克服，什么任务都能完成，什么人间奇迹都能创造。
