Nyerere, the President of Tanzania, recently praised the self-reliant spirit shown by the Chinese people in their national construction.

According to an article published by the organ of the Tanganyika African National Union, the *Uhuru*, President Nyerere, while inspecting the northern province of Tanganyika, spoke to the people of Wude Village and said, "When I visited China, the working achievements of the Chinese people left a deep impression on me. I would even be willing to let 10 million Tanzanians go to China to see for themselves what the Chinese people are doing if it were possible."

President Nyerere also praised the enthusiasm shown by the villagers in their self-reliant efforts to build a road.

Previously, President Nyerere addressed the people of Kilimanjaro in northern Tanzania, saying that the Chinese people are an example of self-reliance.

Nyerere said, "The Chinese people, starting from a very low level, have relied on their own strength to manufacture everything and are now able to produce goods that meet world standards."

He called on the local Tanzanian people to build and develop small-scale industries. He believed that Tanzania would also be able to produce high-standard products that meet world standards in the future.

According to the *Uhuru*, Oscar Kambona, the Minister of Local Government and the Secretary-General of the ruling Tanganyika African National Union, said on July 27 that the Tanzanian people must develop a self-reliant spirit to develop the national economy.

The *Uhuru* published an editorial on August 22, stating: "We must rely on ourselves and our resources to develop the country." The editorial emphasized: "To achieve our goals, self-reliance is the key."

The editorial pointed out that relying completely on "aid" from imperialist countries, "from a long-term perspective, will completely destroy us and drive us into the insatiable claws of neo-colonialism. We must be self-reliant."

    尼雷尔总统盛赞：
    中国是自力更生的榜样
    坎博纳说坦桑也要用自力更生精神发展民族经济
    新华社达累斯萨拉姆二十二日电　据坦噶尼喀非洲民族联盟机关报《民族主义者报》发表的一篇文章说，坦桑尼亚总统尼雷尔最近盛赞中国人民在国家建设中所表现的自力更生精神。
    尼雷尔总统最近在坦桑尼亚北部坦噶省视察过程中对武德村的人民讲话时说，“当我在中国访问的时候，中国人民的工作成就给我很深的印象，以致我曾说过，如果有可能让一千万坦桑尼亚人民到中国去亲眼看看中国人民正在进行什么工作的话，我会愿意这样做的。”
    尼雷尔总统还盛赞这个村庄的居民以自力更生精神在修筑一条公路中所表现出来的热情。
    在这之前不久，尼雷尔总统向坦桑尼亚北部乞力马札罗的人民发表讲话时说，中国人民是贯彻自力更生精神的榜样。
  尼雷尔说，中国人民依靠自己的力量从不很高的水平开始制造一切东西，现在已经能够生产达到世界水平的东西。
    他号召当地的坦桑尼亚人民建设和发展小型工业。他相信坦桑尼亚将来也能生产达到世界水平的高标准产品。
    据《民族主义者报》报道，坦桑尼亚地方政府部长、执政党坦噶尼喀非洲民族联盟总书记奥斯卡·坎博纳七月二十七日说，坦桑尼亚人民必须发扬自力更生精神来发展民族经济。
    《民族主义者报》八月二十二日发表社论说：“我们必须依靠我们自己和我们的资源发展国家。”社论强调指出：“为了实现我们的目的，自力更生是关键所在。”
    社论指出，完全依靠来自帝国主义国家的“外援”，“从长远的观点来看，会把我们完全毁掉，把我们驱入新殖民主义的贪得无厌的魔爪。我们必须自力更生。”
