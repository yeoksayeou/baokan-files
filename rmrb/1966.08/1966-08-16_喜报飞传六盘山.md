	The Hui and Han peoples of Xiji, Jingyuan, and other counties have resolved to carry out the battle tasks set forth in the communiqué with the revolutionary spirit of "Not reaching the Great Wall is not a true hero."

	The Hui and Han peoples of the Liupan Mountains in Ningxia, where Chairman Mao once passed through during the Long March, are jubilantly celebrating the issuance of the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. They have resolved to carry out the battle tasks set forth in the communiqué with the revolutionary spirit of "Not reaching the Great Wall is not a true hero."

	When the communiqué was broadcast in Xiji County on the afternoon of the 13th, the entire county was filled with the sound of drums and gongs until late into the night. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Pingfeng People's Commune immediately wrote big-character posters and letters of resolve, carrying portraits of Chairman Mao and placards with Chairman Mao's quotations, crossing mountains and valleys, and traveling over thirty li to report the good news to the commune party committee. The people of the entire county expressed their determination to forever closely follow the great Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, to fear no difficulties and obstacles, and to forge ahead into the wind and waves.

	When the communiqué reached Jingyuan County, where the Hui people reside, the mountain city immediately erupted in joy. People braved the rain to report the good news to the county party committee. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants firmly expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to follow the path of Dazhai, and to turn the people's commune into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

	In Guyuan County, peasants of the people's commune who were working in the fields were overjoyed upon hearing the broadcast. Over a hundred representatives from five counties in the Liupan Mountains area were participating in a conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works in Touying People's Commune of Guyuan County. Upon hearing the communiqué, they joyfully shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" In Longde County, many peasants of the people's communes held parades and rallies to celebrate. Many poor and lower-middle peasants were extremely moved and said: Dearest leader Chairman Mao! You have truly cared for us. Even if we shout "Long live Chairman Mao" a thousand times, ten thousand times, we cannot express our boundless love for you. No matter how strong the wind or how high the waves, the socialist state you have led us to establish, we will definitely preserve it forever.

　　喜报飞传六盘山
    西吉、泾源等县回汉人民，决心以“不到长城非好汉”的革命精神，实现公报提出的战斗任务
    毛主席长征时经过的宁夏六盘山区的回汉族人民，热烈欢呼党的八届十一中全会公报的发表，决心以“不到长城非好汉”的革命精神实现公报提出的战斗任务。
    当公报在十三日下午传到西吉县以后，全县锣鼓喧天，直到深夜。这个县平峰公社的贫下中农社员马上写大字报，写决心书，抬着毛主席像，举着毛主席语录牌，翻山越沟，跑了三十多里路，到公社党委报喜。全县人民纷纷表示，永远紧紧跟着伟大的党和伟大的领袖毛主席，不怕任何困难和障碍，迎着大风大浪前进。
    公报传到回族聚居的泾源县，山城立刻一片欢腾。人们冒雨向县委报喜。广大贫下中农坚定地表示，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，走大寨的道路，把人民公社办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    在固原县，正在田间劳动的人民公社社员听到广播后，欣喜若狂。六盘山区五个县的一百多名代表，正在固原县头营公社参加学习毛主席著作积极分子现场会议，他们听到公报后尽情欢呼：“毛主席万岁，万万岁！”隆德县许多人民公社社员举行了庆祝游行和集会，不少贫下中农非常激动地说：最敬爱的领袖毛主席啊！你为我们真是操够心了。我们喊上一千声、一万声“毛主席万岁”，也说不尽对你老人家的无限热爱。不管风多大浪多高，你引导我们打下的社会主义江山，我们一定要永远保住它。
