In London, many representatives from African and Latin American organizations have enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao's profound assertion that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. They have pointed out that Chairman Mao is the great revolutionary leader of our time and the helmsman for the liberation of the world's people.

The chairman of the steering committee of the Caribbean October Congress, James, told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency: "Once the masses of the Caribbean people grasp Chairman Mao's thought, imperialism will in fact become a paper tiger."

He emphasized: "Chairman Mao's assertion that political power grows out of the barrel of a gun is absolutely correct. Today, the situation in certain regions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America proves that if the masses do not seize power by taking up arms, they will not achieve victory or will be overthrown."

He said: "Chairman Mao and his thought are the compass, helmsman, and navigator for the liberation of the Caribbean masses and the world's people. Chairman Mao's thought is the development and elevation of Marxism-Leninism, and it is in the interests of the oppressed people of the entire world."

He said: "Today, imperialism in its dying stage is struggling, and the revisionists led by the Soviet Union are colluding with American imperialists. In such a world, Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the revolutionary Chinese people but also the great revolutionary leader of the Caribbean and the oppressed people of the entire world." He shouted: "Long live the revolutionary Chinese people! Long live Chairman Mao!"

The representative of the Basutoland Congress Party in London, Morabo, pointed out: "Chairman Mao's revolutionary assertion about paper tigers will continue to be the guiding light in the anti-imperialist struggle until all imperialist forces in the world are completely eliminated."

The former chairman of the South West Africa People's Organization, J. K. Chanzigezi, said: "Undoubtedly, American imperialists will be defeated, because as Chairman Mao said, 'The American reactionaries will one day find themselves isolated in the world.' This is what is happening today."

According to Xinhua News Agency in Dar es Salaam, the acting representative of the South West Africa People's Organization in Dar es Salaam, Kanzu, recently told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency: "We, the South West Africa People's Organization, wholeheartedly hail Chairman Mao Zedong's participation in the million-person rally in Beijing."

He praised "Chairman Mao as the guiding star for the revolutionary people of the whole world."

He said: "We believe that without destroying the old society, the people cannot build a new society." He also said: "Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese people are smashing the reactionary culture and building a progressive proletarian culture."

He said that the Cultural Revolution in China has set a good example for "revolutionary people." He also pointed out that the people of Asia and Africa, by reading and studying Chairman Mao's works, can "defeat American imperialists and their lackeys, as well as the modern revisionists led by the Soviet Union."

    在伦敦的非洲和拉美人士赞颂毛泽东思想是世界革命的指针
    毛主席是世界人民的伟大舵手
    西南非洲民族主义者说中国文化大革命为革命人民树立了好榜样
    据新华社伦敦二十八日电　在伦敦的一些非洲和拉丁美洲组织的许多代表热烈赞颂毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断，并且指出，毛主席是当代伟大的革命领袖、世界人民获得解放的舵手。
    加勒比十月大会主席团主席詹姆斯对新华社记者说：“一旦加勒比的人民大众掌握了毛主席的思想，帝国主义事实上就成了一只纸老虎。”
    他强调说：“毛主席关于枪杆子里面出政权的论断是太正确了。今天，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲某些地区的情况证明了：如果群众不通过掌握枪杆子来获得管理自己的权力，那么他们就不会取得胜利，或者就会被推翻。”
    他说：“毛主席和他的思想是加勒比人民大众和世界人民获得解放的指南针、舵手和领航员。毛主席思想是马克思列宁主义的发展和提高，是符合全世界被压迫人民的利益的。”
    他说：“今天，处于垂死阶段的帝国主义正在进行挣扎，以苏联（修正主义集团）为首的修正主义者正在同美帝国主义者勾结。在这样的世界上，毛主席不仅是革命的中国人民的伟大领袖，而且也被加勒比和全世界被压迫人民奉为当代的伟大革命领袖。”他高呼：“革命的中国人民万岁！毛主席万岁！”
    巴苏陀兰大会党驻伦敦代表莫拉波指出：“毛主席关于纸老虎的革命论断必将继续成为反帝斗争中的指路明灯，直到全世界的一切帝国主义势力彻底完蛋。”
    西南非洲民族联盟前主席贾·科章吉济说：“毫无疑问，美帝国主义者终将被打败，因为正如毛主席所说，‘美国反动派终有一天将会发现他们自己是处在全世界人民的反对中。’这就是今天正在发生的事情。”
    据新华社达累斯萨拉姆电　西南非洲民族联盟驻达累斯萨拉姆代理代表坎祖最近对新华社记者发表谈话说：“我们西南非洲民族联盟以最大敬意欢呼毛泽东主席参加在北京举行的百万人大会。”
    他称颂“毛主席是全世界革命人民的指路星。”
    他说：“我们认为，人民不摧毁旧社会就无法建立新社会。”他还说：“中国人民在毛泽东思想的指导下正在粉碎反动的文化，建立进步的无产阶级文化。”
    他说，中国的文化大革命为“革命人民树立了良好的榜样。”他还指出，亚非人民阅读和研究了毛主席著作，就可以“击败美帝国主义者及其走狗和以苏联修正主义集团为首的现代修正主义者”。
