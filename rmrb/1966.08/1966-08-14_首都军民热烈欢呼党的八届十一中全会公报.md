Millions upon millions of people unanimously declared that they would definitely study and propagate the communiqué most seriously and actively, and execute the battle tasks proposed in the communiqué most resolutely and bravely. They would carry the socialist revolution through to the end and strive to achieve the Third Five-Year Plan and build our country into a powerful socialist state.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 13th, the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, which was published today, has caused the strongest response among the hundreds of thousands of people in the capital and has been met with the most enthusiastic cheers. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and cadres have all expressed that they will definitely study and propagate the communiqué most seriously and actively, and execute the battle tasks proposed in the communiqué most resolutely and bravely. They will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the socialist revolution through to the end and strive to achieve the Third Five-Year Plan and build our country into a powerful socialist state.

Countless workers, peasants, and soldiers, after listening to the broadcast of the communiqué, braved the torrential rain and gathered in groups to go to the reception station for the masses at the Party Central Committee's location, delivering letters of joy and declarations of resolve. Some of the letters of joy and declarations of resolve pointed out, "This communiqué of the Party Central Committee's plenary session expresses the fearless heroism and revolutionary spirit of the 700 million people of our country, and every word and sentence shines with the brilliant light of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought." Some said, "The communiqué has made the most comprehensive, scientific, and profound judgments on the current domestic and international situations, and has issued the most correct, wise, and timely battle calls to the people of the entire country."

At 5 PM today, thousands of loudspeakers broadcast the voice of the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Party throughout every corner of the city. As soon as the broadcast of the communiqué ended, the entire city of Beijing boiled over. In every factory, school, government office, people's commune, and on every street in the capital, the cheers of "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Mao ten thousand times!" erupted. The broad road near the reception station for the masses at the location of the Central Committee of the Communist Party was jammed by tens of thousands of celebratory processions.

Among the surging crowds heading towards the reception station for the masses at the Party Central Committee's location, the entire workforce of the Beijing Printing Factory No. 2 was particularly excited. They expressed their resolve here to the people of the capital and the nation: they would definitely respond to the call of the communiqué with actual actions, and print more, faster, and better the works of the great leader Chairman Mao.

At the time of the heaviest rain, the members of the Song and Dance Troupe of the Political Department of the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army arrived at the reception station for the masses at the Party Central Committee's location. They climbed onto the stage, facing the wind and rain, and sang loudly the new song they had just composed, "Celebrating the Communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Party." They sang, "The mountains are cheering, the sea is laughing, the red sun rises in the east, and the bright lamp shines high. The Party Central Committee issues a communiqué, and the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought is held high."

Many factory workers held parades and rallies, saying that the communiqué is our action plan and our compass. We are determined to seize the revolution and promote production, achieving a double harvest of revolution and production. More than 2,000 workers of the Beijing Steel Plant, after listening to the broadcast, enthusiastically praised the revolutionary scene of the entire country being hot and bustling under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. The workers also held discussions while sending representatives to the reception station for the masses at the Party Central Committee to express their resolve. They declared that they would forever listen to Chairman Mao's words, learn from Daqing, learn from the People's Liberation Army, dare to tread the paths that predecessors have not trodden, and dare to scale the peaks that predecessors have not scaled, turning the factory into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The cadres and members of the suburban people's communes, after listening to the broadcast, said that they were so excited that their hearts were about to jump out. Some people did not even have time to eat dinner and rushed into the city to report the good news with drums and gongs. Many poor and lower-middle peasants said that they would definitely study the communiqué of the Party Central Committee seriously and firmly hold the printing press, resolutely carrying the socialist revolution through to the end.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 13th, the broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing were immersed in joy from the afternoon to late at night today. After the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party was broadcast on the radio, the various organs, companies, schools, and hospitals of the troops stationed in Beijing immediately boiled over. The cadres and soldiers, with hearts full of boundless excitement, enthusiastically shouted, "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"

The cadres and soldiers, with hearts full of boundless love, admiration, and reverence for the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, listened to the broadcast over and over again, held discussions and exchanges, and expressed their most resolute and enthusiastic support for the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. They would most resolutely and actively respond to the call of the Party Central Committee, carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the socialist revolution through to the end. In the General Staff Department, the General Political Department, the General Logistics Department, and the leadership organs of various military branches and arms, and in many units of the Beijing troops, the cadres and soldiers, under the inspiration of the communiqué of the plenary session, carried portraits of Chairman Mao, held up quotations from Chairman Mao, beat drums and gongs, and enthusiastically cheered. Some immediately put up blackboard newspapers and wall newspapers, wrote declarations of resolve, and sang enthusiastically "The East Is Red" and "The Great Sea Navigates by the Helmsman." Every organ and unit became a sea of joy.

The first-level national hero of the former East China Military Region and the director of the Third Clinic of the General Staff Department, Li Landin, said after listening to the broadcast: The convening of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the issuance of the communiqué of the meeting are another great event for the people of our country and the people of the world. The communiqué of the meeting embodies the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. It is the most brilliant summary of the experience of the international communist movement, the people's anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle, and our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction over the past four years. It is a document of great historical significance for the world proletarian revolution. It is a new development of Mao Zedong Thought. The facts of the past four years have eloquently proven that Chairman Mao's series of wise decisions are extremely correct.

The broad cadres and soldiers of the Communications Corps, after hearing the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on the radio, were filled with joy and passion. They enthusiastically wrote big-character posters, warmly welcoming this communiqué, which is not only a great event for the Chinese people but also a great event for the revolutionary people of the world. We will definitely resolutely respond to the great battle call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, study Mao Zedong Thought diligently, and in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation, closely follow Chairman Mao, carrying the proletarian revolution through to the end.

Many units of the troops, with revolutionary passion, braved the rain to go to the reception station for the masses at the Party Central Committee to express their resolve to warmly support the communiqué and resolutely respond to the call of the Party Central Committee. The Political Department Song and Dance Troupe of the Engineering Corps, together with the cadres and soldiers of the leadership organs of the Engineering Corps, performed artistic programs such as "Celebrating the Communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party" that they had just created and rehearsed when they went to the reception station to express their resolve to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.

The cadres and soldiers resolutely declared that they would definitely, according to the instructions of the communiqué, further heighten their vigilance and strengthen their readiness for war, to liberate the national territory of Taiwan, prevent sudden attacks by American imperialism and its accomplices, and be ready at any time to contribute all their strength to support the world revolution.

The revolutionary teachers and students of all nationalities at the Central Institute for Nationalities, after hearing the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, enthusiastically cheered for the most beloved great leader Chairman Mao of all nationalities in our country! Ten thousand times ten thousand years! They expressed their resolute support for the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee.
