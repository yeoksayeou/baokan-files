The six years of building the Daqing Oilfield have been six years of holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and criticizing the bourgeoisie. Without struggle, Daqing Oilfield could not have been built, and without struggle, communism could not be achieved.

I have just returned from a visit to Albania and saw Chairman Mao's instructions. I am truly delighted! We must resolutely and thoroughly carry out Chairman Mao's instructions, and pass them down from generation to generation, for a thousand years, ten thousand years, forever. We must turn the entire country into a grand school of Mao Zedong Thought, uproot the roots of capitalism and revisionism, and promote the world revolution.

Daqing Oilfield was built according to Chairman Mao's thoughts. The six years of Daqing have been six years of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Without following Chairman Mao's thoughts, today's Daqing would not have been possible.

In Albania, I told the Albanian workers that one drilling team in Daqing can drill 6,000 meters in a month. They asked, "What do you rely on to drill?" I said, "We rely on Mao Zedong Thought to drill!" When I returned, the leaders told me that the figures I mentioned were already outdated. Now, our 1202 and 1205 teams can drill over 10,900 meters in a month.

From 1960 to now, we in Daqing have been conducting political training every year. We prioritize politics in all our work, not just the number of meters drilled per day. Every day, we check how we have applied Chairman Mao's thoughts, what was done well, what was not done well, and how to improve tomorrow. This is how we have been doing it for the past six years.

By studying Chairman Mao's works every day, emphasizing politics every day, and conducting class education every day, people's consciousness has been rapidly raised. Take my former team, the 1205 drilling team, for example. The current team leader, Wang Zuofu, was once my apprentice. He is much more skilled than I was when I was the team leader. In 1958, the annual goal for a team was to drill 10,000 meters, but now they can drill over 10,900 meters in a month.

In 1958, when Chairman Mao inspected Wuhan Steel Works, he instructed that such large-scale enterprises could gradually be developed into comprehensive combined enterprises, including industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and the military. We in Daqing Oilfield have been following Chairman Mao's teachings from the start, gradually reducing the three major differences. Here, oil workers go to farm every year. In the early years, when there were not enough animals, people pulled the plows, and the leaders also pulled the plows. College students carried night soil to the fields in basins. Without Chairman Mao's thoughts, how could we do this!

When we first arrived, there were no houses, so we built "dry rammed earth" houses. Later, when the economy improved, some people wanted to build brick houses, large buildings, and large clubs. The leaders said, "We in Daqing will not build large buildings." This is not just for economic reasons, but mainly for political reasons. We must always consider how to reduce the three major differences and build a new type of mining area that is "industrial and agricultural, urban and rural, conducive to production and convenient for life," and we will not build large cities.

Most of the college students who came to Daqing performed very well. In our team, there was a female student named Xiao Duan. When she heard that there was a shortage of drill bits, she quietly went to a place 80 li away to get them before dawn. She returned the next day at around 2-3 AM, covered in mud, carrying the drill bits. Usually, she also cooked for the workers, washed clothes; on the well, she wrote materials and rolled up her pants to go down the well to fetch water. With Mao Zedong Thought, any human miracle can be created.

Chairman Mao teaches us workers to criticize the bourgeoisie. The six years of building Daqing Oilfield have been six years of using Mao Zedong Thought to criticize the bourgeoisie. Class struggle must never be relaxed; we must struggle for a lifetime. Even if we cannot finish the struggle, our descendants must continue it. Without struggle, Daqing Oilfield could not have been built, and without struggle, communism could not be achieved. From the beginning in 1960, the fireline rectification was about class struggle. At that time, we saw such a good oilfield and were so happy that we cried, and even if we died, we wanted to be buried here. But some people hated this place and said they would not even urinate here. How could we not struggle!

I was away for two months, and when I returned, I saw the Cultural Revolution being carried out vigorously, and I was truly delighted! We vow to defend the Party Central Committee, defend Chairman Mao, and defend Mao Zedong Thought to the death.

This time when I went abroad, I saw that the revolutionary people of foreign countries love Chairman Mao so much. Our Chairman Mao, our Party, our country is so good! We Chinese workers must read Chairman Mao's books more, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, forever be thorough revolutionaries of the proletariat!

   石油部五好标兵、大庆“铁人”王进喜：
   千年万代照毛主席指示办事
   建设大庆油田的六年，就是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、批判资产阶级的六年。大庆油田不斗争根本搞不出来，共产主义不斗争也出不来
    我刚从阿尔巴尼亚访问回来，看到毛主席的指示，真高兴！我们要最坚决、最彻底地执行毛主席这个指示，子孙辈辈都执行下去，一千年、一万年，永远执行下去。我们一定要把全国办成毛泽东思想的大学校，挖掉资本主义、修正主义的根子，推动世界革命。
    大庆油田就是按毛主席思想搞的。大庆的六年，就是活学活用毛主席著作的六年。不按毛主席思想搞，根本不可能有今天的大庆。
    在阿尔巴尼亚，我向阿尔巴尼亚的工人兄弟说，大庆的一个钻井队，一个月打六千米。他们问：“你们靠什么打的？”我说：“我们靠毛泽东思想打的！”回来领导上告诉我，我说的数字已经落后了。我们一二○二队和一二○五队，现在一个队一个月打一万零九百多米。
    从一九六○年到现在，我们大庆年年搞政治整训。做一切工作先讲政治，不是先讲一天打多少米。我们天天检查今天怎么活学活用毛主席的思想，那点用的够，那点用的不够，明天怎么办。这六年，我们一直是这样做的。
    天天学毛主席著作，天天突出政治，天天抓阶级教育，人们的觉悟提高得很快。就拿我过去工作的一二○五钻井队来说吧，现在的队长王作福，过去是我的徒弟，他比我当队长时水平高多了。一九五八年一个队一年的奋斗目标是打一万米，现在他们一个月就打一万零九百多米。
    一九五八年，毛主席视察武钢的时候，指示说：像武钢这样的大型企业，可以逐步地办成为综合性的联合企业，……除工业外，农、商、学、兵都要有一点。我们大庆油田，一上手就是按照毛主席这个教导办事，逐步缩小三大差别。在我们这里，石油工人每年都去种地。开头几年牲口不够，靠人拉犁，领导干部也拉犁。大学生拿洗脸盆端粪上地。不是靠毛主席的思想，怎么能这样干！
    刚来时，没房子住，我们就搞“干打垒”。后来，经济好转了，有人就想搞砖房，盖大楼，搞大俱乐部。领导同志说，我们大庆坚决不盖大楼。这不只是从经济上考虑，主要是从政治上考虑。我们处处要为缩小三大差别着想，建设一个“工农结合、城乡结合，有利生产，方便生活”的新型矿区，坚决不搞大城市。
    大学生来大庆，绝大多数人表现得很好。我们那队有个女学生小段，听说开钻缺钻头，天不亮，就悄悄地跑到八十里开外的地方去取，到第二天下半夜二三点，滚了一身泥巴，挑着钻头回来了。平时她还给工人做饭，洗衣服；到井上写资料，还卷起裤腿下井去端水。有了毛泽东思想，任何人间奇迹都能创造出来。
    毛主席教导我们工人要批判资产阶级。建设大庆油田的六年，就是用毛泽东思想批判资产阶级的六年。阶级斗争一刻也不能放松，我们要斗争一辈子，我们斗不完，子孙后代还要斗下去。大庆油田不斗争根本搞不出来，共产主义不斗争也出不来。一九六○年一开始搞的火线整风就是搞阶级斗争。当时我们看到这样好的油田，高兴得直流泪，死了也要埋在这里。可是有的人却讨厌这地方，说尿尿都不往这里尿。不斗争怎么行！
    我出国两个月，回来看文化大革命搞的轰轰烈烈，真高兴！我们誓死也要保卫党中央、保卫毛主席、保卫毛泽东思想。
    我这次出国，看到外国革命人民都那样热爱毛主席。我们的毛主席，我们的党，我们的国家多好呵！我们中国工人要更好地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，永远做无产阶级彻底革命派！
