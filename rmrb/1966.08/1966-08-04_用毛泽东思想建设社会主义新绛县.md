**Building Socialist New Xian County with Mao Zedong Thought**

**By Zhou Mingshan, Secretary of the Xian County Committee of the Communist Party of China**

**Editor's Note:** This is an excerpt from a speech given by Zhou Mingshan, Secretary of the Xian County Committee of the Communist Party of China, at a meeting. Zhou Mingshan was appointed as the county committee secretary from a production brigade secretary in January. Relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, he took on this heavy responsibility. In his new position, he continued to focus on the fundamental task of studying Chairman Mao's works, not only studying himself, but also leading the county committee to study, mobilizing all cadres to study, and mobilizing the masses to study, forming a mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works throughout the county. On the basis of the ideological transformation of cadres and the masses, everyone has a common language, and leadership work becomes easier.

Today, every village in Xian County has night schools and study groups for studying Chairman Mao's works, every household reads Chairman Mao's books, and tens of thousands of people have begun to act according to Mao Zedong Thought. The spiritual and work styles of the people of Xian County are undergoing profound changes.

The practices and experiences shared by Zhou Mingshan will be inspiring for all county committee members in achieving leadership transformation. We hope everyone will read it carefully.

Currently, Xian County, like all other counties across the country, is launching a mass movement to study Chairman Mao's works. An era in which the broad masses directly grasp and apply Mao Zedong Thought has begun. This is a historic event for Xian County.

Mao Zedong Thought is the red sun in the hearts of revolutionary people, the lifeline, the most precious treasure, more important than air and food, and indispensable for even a moment. This is the deepening understanding of the broad masses of farmers in Xian County. As the socialist revolution and construction deepen, the class consciousness of the people continues to rise, and they increasingly believe in, respect, and love Chairman Mao. Now, Xian County basically has study groups for Chairman Mao's works in every brigade, every household has a plaque with Chairman Mao's quotations, and has Chairman Mao's books. Reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions have gradually become conscious actions of the people. Under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, the spiritual and natural landscapes of Xian County are undergoing profound changes.

**County Committee Tasks Are Numerous, What to Prioritize First?**

**First, Focus on Studying and Applying Chairman Mao's Works, and Promote Ideological Transformation**

In January, I was suddenly transferred from a production brigade to the county. At that time, I was very nervous. Could I shoulder the heavy responsibility entrusted by the Party? The tasks of a county are so numerous, what should be prioritized first? But when I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings, I found strength. Based on my experience as a brigade secretary in Nangliu, I thought that as long as we strictly follow Chairman Mao's instructions, there would be no difficulties we cannot overcome and no tasks we cannot complete. This task, that task, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is the primary task; this is urgent, that is urgent, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is the most urgent.

Upon arriving at the county committee, I first discussed with the six standing committee members how to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in conjunction with our ideological situation. Xian County has done a lot of work in recent years and achieved great results. However, compared to the leadership's requirements, the masses' expectations, and the development of the situation, there are still many gaps, mainly ideological gaps. Lack of water and fertilizer are surface phenomena, the root cause is the lack of Mao Zedong Thought, the county committee's leadership thought has not been transformed.

Before I came to work in the county, the higher-level party committee had clearly instructed: Xian County should take the lead in studying Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing politics, and promoting ideological transformation, bringing all work forward, building a socialist new Xian County, and entering the ranks of advanced counties at a faster pace. This instruction was conveyed at the standing committee meeting, and it greatly inspired everyone. Who would do this work? How would we mobilize the cadres? The key is whether the county committee can take the lead in seriously studying Chairman Mao's works and promoting ideological transformation. However, at that time, the county committee had many tasks: drought relief production, basic construction, industry, commerce, finance, and trade, etc. What should be prioritized first? Through study and discussion, everyone unified their ideological understanding: first, focus on studying Chairman Mao's works. And a plan was drafted to study Chairman Mao's works extensively and achieve ideological transformation.

The county committee first, with a revolutionary spirit, studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles," compared themselves with six people: Norman Bethune, Zhang Zedong, the Old Man of the Mountain, Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and Jiao Yulu. Using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, taking Norman Bethune and others as examples, based on their participation in the three great revolutions, they looked in the mirror, exposed their thoughts, and dug out the roots, engaging in self-revolution. I first made a self-criticism, everyone poured out their hearts, and confessed to the Party. Many comrades were ashamed and remorseful for not changing the face of Xian County. However, everyone did not stop at the stage of shame and remorse, but under the inspiration of the heroic images of Jiao Yulu and others, conducted a profound self-examination, determined to thoroughly eliminate the "self" and "private" characters, become the old ox of the people of the whole county, and work hard for the people for a lifetime. If they do not change the face of Xian County, they will die with their eyes closed.

To broadly solicit everyone's opinions and help the county committee with ideological transformation, we also held an expanded county committee meeting. Everyone together re-studied Chairman Mao's works, the county committee standing committee members took the lead in self-criticism, and mobilized cadres at all levels to criticize the county committee. Due to the county committee's sincere attitude and serious self-criticism, comrades not only raised more than six thousand opinions about the county committee but also required self-revolution. In this way, everyone from top to bottom used Mao Zedong Thought to thoroughly eliminate the "self" and "private" characters, and established a worldview of not seeking fame, not seeking profit, not fearing hardship, not fearing death, wholeheartedly for the people, and wholeheartedly for the revolution, to change the sky and land of Xian County, and contribute everything.

On the basis of re-recognizing oneself, re-recognizing Xian County, and formulating a five-year plan to transform the rivers and mountains of Xian County. After investigation and research and sufficient discussion, the draft for construction with water, soil, fertilizer, livestock, trees, electricity, and industry as the center was initially passed. Everyone unanimously agreed: the leadership has clear instructions, the masses have strong aspirations, and the objective conditions are also possible. The key is in the cadres, whether the county committee can organize all the cadres in the county to extensively study Chairman Mao's works and promote ideological and organizational transformation.

**Ideological Issues Are Numerous, What to Provide First?**

**First, Provide the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and Promote Organizational Transformation**

The poor and lower-middle peasants have a strong desire to build a socialist new Xian County and urgently hope that the county will send people to lead them in revolution and construction. However, when it comes to the organization, there are many different opinions: the organization has many tasks and cannot send people down; if they go down, the organization's work cannot be managed; east and west, only one side can be managed; in short, there are many difficulties.

What to do? Ultimately, it still depends on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and promoting organizational transformation. In mid-February, the county committee held a meeting of 1,800 people, with the standing committee members taking the lead in self-criticism. Some comrades criticized the decline in revolutionary will, long-term detachment from the masses, seeking comfort, fearing hardship and fatigue, fearing to go to the countryside, and fearing to stay in the countryside, etc. After studying the "Three Constantly Read Articles," everyone decided to contribute their strength to change the sky and land of Xian County. Then, they discussed the plan for organizational transformation, and each organization sent three-quarters of the comrades to form work teams to stay in the countryside for a long time, plus the original cadres, and the county had four-fifths of the cadres working in the countryside for a long time.

Sending so many people to the countryside to stay, can the organization's work be done well? This is another new debate. After repeatedly studying the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and "On the Reunification of China," they discussed the relationship between politics and business, central work, and various business systems, and believed that the key to solving contradictions is whether to seriously read Chairman Mao's books, use Mao Zedong Thought to transform oneself, and arm the masses. After unifying their understanding, they deployed the entire county's 158 brigades in a lotus pattern, selected 54 key points, and used the method of one leading two, through guiding the study of Chairman Mao's works, guiding the work of the party branches, and promoting advanced experiences, to bring up the work and study of the entire county. In this way, after unifying thoughts and deploying, everyone confidently brought Chairman Mao's works to the countryside. The cadres who stayed in the organization also seriously used Mao Zedong Thought to transform their thoughts and improve their work, achieving the transformation of work style. From the organization to the store, from the leading cadres to the workers, everywhere is actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, creating a new situation of great progress in ideology, great change in work style, and great development in work. Mao Zedong Thought has become a great driving force for the work of various departments.

A clerk in the Civil Affairs Bureau, through extensively studying Chairman Mao's works, took on the work of two bureaus (Civil Affairs and Labor Bureau) with nine people, and managed the ten major items and forty-eight contents of the business in an orderly manner. His main method of work is to use Mao Zedong Thought to solve problems, grasp the main contradictions, learn to "play the piano," and do different work separately. He turned the place where the Civil Affairs Bureau resolves mass disputes into a place for studying Chairman Mao's works, gave Mao Zedong Thought to the masses, and let them solve their own problems. The masses reflected: "No matter how big your problem is, once you go to the Civil Affairs Bureau for a class on Chairman Mao's works, everything is solved."

Many cadres and workers went out of the organization, out of the counter, out of the factory, and did everything possible to convenience the masses, wholeheartedly serving agriculture. Many units broke the rules, broke the business circle, started from solving ideological and production arrangements, and did a good job.

Various departments have seriously reformed unreasonable and inconvenient production regulations. The Nanguan Granary used to have eighteen people, now one person does the work of three (agricultural management, processing, and storage), goes down to do one thing, and comes back to divide the work. In this way, both personnel are saved and work is convenient.

**The Tasks in the Points Are Numerous, What to Prioritize First?**

**Guide the Masses to Study and Apply Chairman Mao's Works, and Promote Mass Ideological Transformation**

The work in the points is complex, what to prioritize first? The standing committee unanimously agreed that studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is the foundation of all work and must be grasped again and again, forever grasped, grasped to the end. The cadres staying in the points must first study and apply well, combine words with deeds, and specifically guide. Going down to the countryside means bringing Mao Zedong Thought and the good style of transformation down.

The county committee's leading example of studying Chairman Mao's works, going deep into the points, and working hard has had a profound impact on the masses. More than 480 cadres in the county, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, study and labor together. They first led the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works. The participants are very broad, from the organization to the countryside, from young people to the elderly, all participate in the study. The county has 48,000 agricultural laborers, but there are 67,000 copies of Chairman Mao's works and 2,000 copies of quotations. There are more than 150 organized study groups and night schools, and even more people listen to the radio. Everyone's enthusiasm for study is unprecedented, and no difficulty can stop them. Many people can link their thoughts, dig out the "self" and "private" characters in their thoughts. They led the ideological transformation of the party branches and other cadres. In the grassroots cadres, studying and laboring have become the norm, establishing class feelings with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and many good cadres and party members have emerged. Ideological transformation promotes production transformation. People everywhere study Chairman Mao's works, talk about changing the sky and land, and the masses have produced tens of thousands of "water enthusiasts," "tree enthusiasts," and "pig enthusiasts."

**The Masses Have Many Demands, What to Provide First?**

**Most Importantly, Provide the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought**

In the struggle to build a socialist new Xian County, the people have many problems to solve, such as building water conservancy projects, improving seeds, etc. What should be solved first? The county committee believes that it is necessary to first focus on the ideological transformation of the people and give Mao Zedong Thought to the broad masses. We plan to, after a period of effort, achieve the goal of studying Chairman Mao's works every day from top to bottom, never forgetting class struggle, and turning Xian County into a large school for studying Chairman Mao's works. Some of our past experiences and practices are:

1. **Study must be linked to reality and thoughts, using Chairman Mao's books to first transform one's worldview and lead the people of the whole county in revolution. The purpose of study is to use. We have three requirements for the county committee: first, not studying Chairman Mao's works is not revolutionary; second, not studying Chairman Mao's works well is not qualified; third, not leading the masses to study Chairman Mao's works well is dereliction of duty.**

2. **Farmers are eager to hear more of Chairman Mao's words. This is a very favorable condition for us to organize farmers to study Chairman Mao's works. We have widely lectured on the great situation at home and abroad, lectured on the history of the Party's struggle, and carried out reminiscence and comparison education. Through lecturing, discussing, and reminiscing, everyone's enthusiasm for study has been aroused. Some old poor peasants also expressed: they want to study Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime, listen to Chairman Mao's words for a lifetime, believe in Chairman Mao for a lifetime, and pass on to their descendants and future generations to believe in Chairman Mao forever. The Donghe Water Brigade, originally only thirty or so young people participated in the study, the cadres staying in the points from land reform, cooperation, people's commune, the growth of heroes, and personal growth from five aspects, carried out a self-education movement of reminiscing, discussing, and summarizing. Through this movement, the entire brigade participating in the study of Chairman Mao's works reached 390 people.**

3. **After ideological mobilization, the masses' demand for studying Chairman Mao's works becomes more urgent. To meet the masses' needs, the county committee established a system of leading the study of Chairman Mao's works from top to bottom. The county, commune, and 54 network points all established guidance stations and appointed more than 100 cadres going to the countryside as guides. They adopted different guidance methods for different objects and situations: comprehensive guidance for common problems; targeted guidance for individual problems; guidance by linking one's own thoughts and speaking from personal experience; for the elderly, women with many children, and livestock keepers who are not easy to concentrate on studying, they went door-to-door for guidance, etc.**

4. **The purpose of studying Chairman Mao's works is to "use," whether it can be used well depends on whether the active thoughts can be grasped, the thought trends can be discovered, and the thought work can be done in advance. Our method is: constantly grasp the fundamental problems. Such as class and class struggle, party building, relying on and believing in the masses, self-reliance and striving for progress, and recognizing problems dialectically, etc. We selected articles such as "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," studied and studied them repeatedly. Grasp the regular problems in advance. Some thought problems that occur among cadres and the masses have certain rules. Such as easily becoming arrogant when praised, easily becoming discouraged when criticized, easily becoming pessimistic when conditions are not good, easily becoming impatient when work is tense, etc. Aiming at these different situations, organize the study of relevant articles by Chairman Mao in advance. Grasp the temporary problems in time. Thoughts are always thinking, always thinking. In addition to the above fundamental and regular problems, the study groups conduct thought sorting, and organize the study of active thoughts in a timely manner for one person and one event.**

5. **After the mass study movement was launched, to further deepen the movement, we also focused on cultivating activists. The county, commune, and brigade all grasped it. They adopted methods such as proposing topics, studying and using more; strict requirements, giving heavy responsibilities; taking the lead, studying ahead; exchanging experiences, and mutual improvement, and cultivated more than 3,000 activists of various types, ages, and occupations from all walks of life in the county. Li Yuzhen, an old woman from the Maotou Brigade, who is illiterate, listens to the radio, finds people to read, and repeatedly studies the "Three Constantly Read Articles," and has three people in her mind: Norman Bethune, Zhang Zedong, and the Old Man of the Mountain. She often speaks to people and leads many elderly people to actively participate in the study. Now, each commune and brigade in the county has produced a large number of study activists and models, forming a "model group" for studying Chairman Mao's works. The power of examples is infinite. These activists have played a great role in promoting the study movement in the county.**

In the past half year, although we have done some work, it is only the beginning, and it is still far from meeting the requirements of the Party and the masses. The main problems are: in studying Chairman Mao's works, the broad masses, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants, study and use them well, while the cadres study less. In actual work, emphasizing politics and truly using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything is still not enough, and the awareness of this is still not high. Also, the construction of the Party's grassroots organizations, especially ideological construction, is not grasped tightly. The development of the movement is still unbalanced. In the future, we will further grasp and grasp the study of Chairman Mao's works, grasp ideological transformation as the fundamental foundation for changing the face of Xian County.

    用毛泽东思想建设社会主义新绛县
    中共山西绛县县委书记　周明山
    编者按：这是山西绛县县委书记周明山同志在一次座谈会上讲话的摘要。周明山同志是今年一月份由一个生产大队的支部书记调任县委书记的。他依靠了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，挑起了党交给的这个重担。他在新的岗位上，继续抓住了学习毛主席著作这个根本的根本，不但自己学，不但发动县委带头学，不但发动广大干部学，而且发动广大群众学，在全县形成了一个活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。在干部、群众思想革命化的基础上，大家有了共同的语言，领导工作也就好做了。
    今天的绛县，村村有学毛主席著作的夜校和讲习所，家家户户读毛主席的书，成千上万的人开始学会照毛泽东思想办事。绛县人的精神面貌和工作面貌正在发生深刻的变化。
    周明山同志谈的这些作法和体会，对我们所有县委同志实现领导革命化是会有所启发的。希望大家认真一读。
    目前，绛县也和全国各兄弟县一样，在全县范围内，掀起了一个群众性的学习毛主席著作的高潮。一个广大群众直接掌握和运用毛泽东思想的伟大时代开始了。这是绛县历史上一件划时代的大喜事。
    毛主席思想是革命人民心里的红太阳、命根子、宝中宝，比空气、粮食还重要，一刻也离不了，这是我们绛县广大农民群众越来越深的体会。随着社会主义革命和建设的深入发展，人民的阶级觉悟不断提高，越来越信仰毛主席，越来越尊敬毛主席，越来越热爱毛主席。现在绛县基本上队队有学习毛主席著作的夜党校、讲习所，户户有主席语录牌，有毛主席的书。读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，已逐渐成为人们的自觉行动。绛县在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，人的精神面貌、自然面貌正在发生深刻变化。
    县委任务多，首先抓什么？
    先抓活学活用毛主席著作，大搞思想革命化
    今年一月份，我从一个生产大队一下子来到县上，当时心里很紧张。我能担起党交给的这个重担吗？一个县的工作任务这么多，到底应该先抓什么？可是一想起毛主席的教导，我就有了力量。根据我在南柳当支部书记的经验，我想，只要严格遵照毛主席的指示办事，就没有战胜不了的困难，完成不了的任务。这任务，那任务，活学活用毛主席著作是首要任务；这要紧，那要紧，学好用好毛主席著作最要紧。
    我一到县委就先同六个常委分别研究如何结合我们的思想情况，活学活用毛主席著作。绛县这些年来做了许多工作，取得了很大成绩。但是，这同领导要求、群众希望、形势发展相比，还有不少差距，最主要的是思想差距。缺水缺肥等是表面现象，总根子是缺毛泽东思想，是县委领导思想没有革命化。
    我来县里工作以前，上级党委曾明确指示：要求绛县在学习毛主席著作、突出政治、大搞思想革命化方面能走在前面，把各项工作带动起来，建设社会主义新绛县，用较快的步伐进入先进行列。这个指示在常委会上传达，对大家启发和鼓舞很大。谁去做这项工作呢？怎样去动员干部呢？关键在于县委能否带头认真学习毛主席著作，大搞思想革命化。但是，当时县委的任务是很多的，抗旱生产呀，基本建设呀，工交财贸呀，等等。到底该先抓啥？通过学习讨论，大家统一了思想认识：先抓毛主席著作的学习。并确定专人起草了大学毛主席著作、实现思想革命化的方案。
    县委首先以革命的精神，学习“老三篇”，对照六个人：白求恩、张思德、老愚公、雷锋、王杰、焦裕禄。以毛主席思想为武器，以白求恩等同志为榜样，以自己参加三大革命的实践为基础，照镜子、亮思想、挖根子，自我革命。我首先作了检查，大家倾吐肺腑，向党交心。不少同志为没有改变绛县的面貌而惭愧，而悔恨。但是大家没有停留在惭愧悔恨这个低级阶段，而是在焦裕禄等同志英雄形象的鼓舞下，进行深刻的自我检查，决心彻底斗掉“我”字，挖去“私”字，当全县人民的老黄牛，好好为人民拉一辈子车，不改变绛县面貌，死不瞑目。
    为了广泛地征求大家的意见，帮助县委思想革命化，我们又召开了县委扩大会议，大家一起重新学习毛主席著作，县委常委带头检查，发动各级干部批评县委。由于县委态度诚恳，检查认真，同志们不仅对县委提了六千多条意见，同时也要求自我革命。这样上下一致，用毛泽东思想大破“私”字，大立“公”字，决心树立不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，一心为人民，一心为革命的世界观，为改绛县之天，换绛县之地，贡献自己的一切。
    在重新认识了自己的基础上，重新认识绛县，制定了一个改造绛县河山的五年规划。经过调查研究和充分讨论，初步通过了以水、土、肥、畜、树、电、工七字为中心的建设草案。大家一致认为：领导有明确指示，群众有强烈愿望，客观条件也有可能。关键就在干部，在于县委是否能把全县干部都组织起来大学毛主席著作，大搞思想革命化和机关革命化。
    思想问题多，首先给什么？
    先给战无不胜的毛泽东思想，大搞机关革命化
    贫下中农对建设社会主义的新绛县有强烈的愿望，迫切希望县里派人好好领导他们搞革命、搞建设。可是提到机关一讨论，却有许多不同的看法：机关任务多，不能抽人下去啦；要下去机关工作就没法管啦；东头西头，只能顾一头啦；总之是困难很多。
    怎么办？归根到底，还是要靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，大搞机关革命化。县委在二月中旬，召开了一千八百人的大会，常委带头作自我批评。有些同志检查了革命意志衰退，长期脱离群众，贪图安逸，怕苦怕累，怕下乡，怕蹲点等等错误思想。经过学习“老三篇”，大家决心为改绛县之天换绛县之地贡献自己的力量。接着又讨论了机关革命化的方案，各机关抽出四分之三的同志组成工作队，长期下乡蹲点，加上原有干部，全县就有五分之四的干部长期在乡下工作了。
    抽这么多的人去下乡蹲点，机关工作能不能搞好呢？这又是一场新的大辩论。经过反复学习了“老三篇”和《关于重庆谈判》等文章，讨论了政治和业务、中心工作和各个业务系统工作的关系，认为解决矛盾的关键，是能不能认真读毛主席的书，用毛泽东思想改造自己，武装群众。认识统一后，把全县一百五十八个大队，按梅花式布点，选择五十四个重点，用一带二的办法，通过抓学习毛主席著作的辅导，支部工作的指导，先进经验的推广，把全县的工作、学习都带起来。这样统一思想、统一部署之后，大家信心百倍地带着毛主席著作下了乡。留在机关的干部，也认真以毛泽东思想改造思想、改进工作，实现了作风革命化。从机关到商店，从领导干部到工人，到处都在活学活用毛主席著作，出现了一个思想大进步，作风大改变，工作大开展的新局面。毛泽东思想成了推动各个部门工作的巨大动力。
    民政局有个干事，通过大学毛主席著作，一人担负两个局（民政、劳动局）九个人的工作，把十大项、四十八个内容的业务，作得井井有条。他工作的主要办法是运用毛泽东思想解决问题，紧抓主要矛盾，学会“弹钢琴”，分别做工作。他把民政局解决群众纠纷的地方，变成了学习毛主席著作的场所，把毛泽东思想交给群众，让他们自己解决自己的问题。群众反映说：“不管你问题多大，一到民政局上堂毛主席著作课，啥都解决了。”
    许多干部职工，走出机关，走出柜台，走出工厂，千方百计方便群众，一心一意为农业服务，不少单位打破常规，踢破业务圈子，从解决思想、安排生产入手，做好工作。
    各部门对不合理、不便利生产的规章制度，认真进行了改革。南樊粮站过去十八人，现在一员变三员（农管员、加工员、保管员），下去一把抓，回来再分家。这样既节约了人员，又便利了工作。
    蹲点任务重，主要抓什么？
    辅导群众活学活用毛主席著作，大搞群众思想革命化
    点上的工作，千头万绪，主要抓什么？常委一致认为，活学活用毛主席著作，是一切工作的根本，必须一抓再抓，永远抓，抓到底。蹲点干部要首先学好用好，言教结合身教，具体辅导。下乡就要把毛泽东思想、把革命化的好作风带下去。
    县委带头学毛主席著作、深入蹲点、踏实苦干的作风，在群众中发生了深刻影响。全县四百八十多名干部，同贫下中农，学习在一起，劳动在一起。他们首先带动了群众性的学习毛主席著作的高潮。参加学习的人很广泛，从机关到农村，从青少年到老人，都参加了学习。全县农业劳动力只有四万八千多人，而毛主席著作就有六万七千多册，语录两千多本。有组织的讲习所和夜党校一百五十多处，听广播的人更多。大家学习热情空前高涨，什么困难也挡不住。很多人能联系思想，挖思想里的“私”字“我”字。他们带动了党支部和其他干部的思想革命化。在基层干部中学习成风，劳动成风，同贫下中农建立起阶级感情，出现了不少好干部、好党员。思想革命化推动了生产革命化。人们到处学毛主席著作，谈改天换地，群众中出现了成千上万的“水迷”、“树迷”、“猪迷”。
    群众要求多，主要给什么？
    最重要的是给战无不胜的毛泽东思想
    人民群众在建设社会主义的新绛县的斗争中，要求解决的问题是很多的，如修水利呀，改良种子呀，……首先应该解决什么呢？县委认为，必须首先抓人的思想革命化，把毛泽东思想交给广大群众。我们打算经过一个时期的努力，做到从上到下天天学毛主席著作，时时不忘阶级斗争，把绛县办成一个学习毛主席著作的大学校。我们过去的一些体会和作法是：
    一、学习一定要联系实际、联系思想，把毛主席的书首先用来改造自己的世界观，带领全县人民革命。学的目的全是为了用。我们对县委提出三条要求：一是不学毛主席著作就是不革命，二是学不好毛主席著作就是不称职，三是不领导群众学好毛主席著作就是失职。
    二、农民是迫切希望多听毛主席的话的。这是我们组织农民学习毛主席著作的十分有利的条件。我们在全县范围内大讲国际国内大好形势，大讲党的斗争历史，开展回忆对比教育工作。一讲一议一回忆，大家的学习热情发动起来了。有些老贫农也表示：要学一辈子毛主席的书，听一辈子毛主席的话，一辈子信仰毛主席，并传给子孙后代，永远信仰毛主席。东贺水大队，原来只有三十几个青年参加学习，蹲点干部就从土地改革、合作化、公社化、英雄人物成长、个人成长五个方面，开展了回忆、讨论、总结的自我教育运动。通过这个运动，全大队参加学习毛主席著作的达到三百九十人。
    三、经过思想发动，群众对毛主席著作学习的要求越来越迫切。为了适应群众的这种需要，县委从上到下建立了一套领导学习毛主席著作的机构和制度。县、公社和五十四个网点，都建立了辅导站，确定了一百多个下乡干部作辅导员。分别不同对象不同情况，采取不同的辅导办法：共同问题，综合辅导；个别问题，针对辅导；联系自己思想，现身说法地进行辅导；老年人、多子女妇女和饲养员不易集中学习，就上门辅导，等等。
    四、学习毛主席著作的目的在于“用”，能不能用好，又在于能不能抓好活思想，发现思想苗头，把思想工作做在前头。我们的办法是：根本性的问题经常抓。如阶级和阶级斗争，党的建设，依靠和相信群众，自力更生奋发图强，一分为二地认识问题等。我们选择了《为人民服务》《中国社会各阶级的分析》等文章，反复学，经常学。规律性的问题提前抓。干部群众中有些思想问题的发生，是有一定的规律的。如受到表扬时易骄傲，受到批评时易灰心，条件不好易悲观，工作紧张易急躁，等等。针对这些不同情况，及早组织学习毛主席的有关文章。临时性的问题及时抓。思想思想，天天在想，时时在想。除了上述根本性、规律性的问题以外，学习小组进行思想排队，及时针对一人一事的活思想组织学习。
    五、群众性的学习运动掀起之后，为了使运动进一步向纵深发展，又狠抓了培养积极分子的工作。县、社、队三级都抓。采取了提出课题，多学多用；严格要求，给重担子；先走一步，学在前面；传经取宝，互相提高等办法，全县培养了男、女、青、老，各行各业的各种积极分子三千多人。么头大队的李玉珍老大娘，一字不识，她听广播，找人念，反复学习“老三篇”，脑子里装上了三个人：白求恩、张思德、老愚公。她经常给人讲，带动很多老人积极参加了学习。现在，全县各社队出现了大批学习积极分子和学习标兵，形成了一个学习毛主席著作的“标兵群”。榜样的力量是无穷的。这些积极分子，在全县学习运动中，起了很大的推动作用。
    半年来我们虽然做了一些工作，但仅仅是个开始，离党和群众的要求还差得很远。主要表现在：在学习毛主席著作上，广大群众特别是贫下中农学用较好，而干部学得较差。在实际工作中突出政治、真正用毛泽东思想统帅一切，作得还很不够，这方面的自觉程度还不够高。再就是对党的基层建设，特别是思想建设抓得不够紧。运动的开展还有不平衡现象。今后，我们将进一步狠抓紧抓对毛主席著作的学习，狠抓思想革命化，作为改变绛县面貌的根本的根本。
