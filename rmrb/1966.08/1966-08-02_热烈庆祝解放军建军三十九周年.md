The General Staff and General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held a banquet to celebrate the 39th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army.

Vice Premier He Long, Chen Yi, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Xu Xiangqian, Ye Jianying, Peng Zhen, Fu Zuoyi, Cai Tingkai, and other leaders attended the banquet.

Invited to the banquet were military attaches from various countries' embassies in China, representatives from the Permanent Mission of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China, and representatives from the Palestine Liberation Organization's office in Beijing.

At the banquet, Deputy Chief of the General Staff Yang Chengwu spoke, pointing out that the past year was one in which the Chinese People's Liberation Army, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, the Military Commission, and Comrade Lin Biao, had raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized political work, and achieved great development, great leaps, and great harvests in the construction of revolutionization and modernization.

He said: Comrade Mao Zedong has always taught us that politics is the commander, the soul; political work is the lifeline of our army. Comrade Lin Biao, based on Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings, has always attached great importance to strengthening the political and ideological work of the army. The emphasis on politics, which he proposed and repeatedly stressed, is the core of Comrade Mao Zedong's military thought and military line, and is the glorious tradition of our army. In November last year, Comrade Lin Biao creatively proposed five principles for continuing to emphasize politics, which were enthusiastically supported and resolutely implemented by the entire army, resulting in great achievements in all areas of work.

Yang Chengwu said: Now, all officers and soldiers of the army, with deep class feelings, are studying Chairman Mao's works eagerly. They regard Mao Zedong's books as the guiding direction for all work, as a telescope and microscope for observing the world, as indispensable food, weapons, and steering wheels in life, work, and combat, and as a magic weapon for overcoming all difficulties and defeating all enemies. He said: Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, good deeds have increased significantly, and the political and ideological work of the troops has been done more actively, more meticulously, more with mass participation, and more solidly. The number and quality of "Four Good" platoons have increased. The army, navy, and air force have achieved great victories in defending the territory, territorial waters, and airspace, maintaining revolutionary order, strengthening national defense construction, militia construction, national defense scientific and technological research, school work, and developing agricultural and sideline production, as well as participating in the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

Yang Chengwu pointed out: All of this is the result of raising high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and emphasizing politics, and vividly proves a truth: spirit can turn into matter, revolutionary spiritual power can turn into great material power, and the masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the strongest force in the world. Yang Chengwu said: The Chinese People's Liberation Army is the army of workers and peasants created and led by the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao. It is the main pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat. It is absolutely loyal to the Party, to the people, to Chairman Mao, and to Mao Zedong Thought. In the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of officers and soldiers of our army, together with the workers and peasants of the whole country, are taking the lead and fighting actively, forming the main force of the cultural revolution, and receiving profound class education in the struggle. We must always remember class struggle, always remember the dictatorship of the proletariat, always remember to emphasize politics, always remember to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and always stand on the front line of defending Mao Zedong Thought, actively participating in the battle to sweep away all ghosts and monsters, and fighting this cultural revolution to the end, not resting until we achieve complete victory.

In his speech, Yang Chengwu strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists' further expansion of aggression against Vietnam. He also severely condemned the modern revisionists and reactionaries as the running dogs of U.S. imperialism, who are running around, devising schemes, and openly serving the U.S. imperialists' plot of "bombing for peace." He said: The Chinese People's Liberation Army firmly supports Chairman Liu Shaoqi's statement of July 22 and firmly supports Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to All Compatriots." We warn the U.S. imperialists: do not bare your fangs and brandish your claws. You are nothing but defeated enemies of the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Volunteers. We have long been prepared to respond to the call of our motherland and fight shoulder to shoulder with the Vietnamese people to completely, thoroughly, and cleanly eliminate the invading bandits.

Yang Chengwu finally emphasized that we must definitely liberate Taiwan! U.S. imperialism must get out of Taiwan!

At the banquet, Colonel Sorescu of the Romanian Embassy's military attaché office, representing the military attaches of various countries in China, extended warm festival greetings to all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He said that the Chinese people have achieved great successes in the construction of their own country. As the reliable defender of the achievements of the Chinese people, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has also achieved great successes in combat training and political education, and in strengthening the country's national defense capabilities.

He said, we wish the Chinese people new and greater successes in building a new and happy life; at the same time, we wish the Chinese People's Liberation Army new successes in combat and political education, and in the cause of defending their motherland—the People's Republic of China.

Senior officials from various departments and branches of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, including Xiao Jinguang, Su Yu, Wang Shusheng, Xu Guangda, Liao Hansheng, Zhang Aiping, Li Tianyou, Wang Xinting, Zhang Zongxun, Liu Zhijian, Yuan Ziqin, Qiu Huizuo, Li Jiuqi, Yang Yong, Han Xianchu, Huang Yongsheng, Chen Xilian, Su Zhenhua, Wu Faxian, and Yu Lijin, attended the banquet.

Also in attendance were Minister of Public Security Zeng Shan, Deputy Foreign Minister Qiao Guanhua, Deputy Director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the State Council Hao Deqing, as well as active learners of Chairman Mao's works, combat heroes, representatives of "Four Good" units, "Five Good" soldiers, revolutionary military families, martyrs' families, militia representatives from Beijing, and representatives from the naval cultural work team of the Guangzhou Military Region.

    新华社一日讯　中国人民解放军总参谋部、总政治部今晚举行宴会，热烈庆祝中国人民解放军建军三十九周年。
    国务院副总理贺龙、陈毅，国防委员会副主席徐向前、叶剑英、程潜、傅作义、蔡廷锴等出席了宴会。
    应邀出席宴会的，有各国驻华大使馆武官，越南南方民族解放阵线常驻我国代表团和巴勒斯坦解放组织驻北京办事处的负责人。
    中国人民解放军代总参谋长杨成武在宴会上讲话，他指出：过去的一年，是中国人民解放军在党中央、毛主席和军委、林彪同志的领导下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大力突出政治，在革命化、现代化建设上获得大发展、大跃进、大丰收的一年。
    他说：毛泽东同志历来教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂，政治工作是我军的生命线。林彪同志根据毛泽东同志历来的教导，一贯重视加强军队的政治思想工作。他提出并一再强调的突出政治，是毛泽东同志军事思想和建军路线的核心，是我军的光荣传统。去年十一月，林彪同志又创造性地提出了继续突出政治的五项原则，全军上下，热烈拥护，坚决执行，因而各项工作都取得了伟大的成就。
    杨成武说：现在，全军指战员，怀着无比深厚的阶级感情，如饥如渴地活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫。他们把毛主席的书当作一切工作的指导方向，当作观察世界的望远镜和显微镜，当作生活、工作和战斗中不可缺少的粮食、武器和方向盘，当作克服一切困难打倒一切敌人的万能法宝。他说：在毛泽东思想的哺育下，好人好事大大增加，部队的政治思想工作，比过去做得更活、更细、更有群众性，更加扎实过硬。四好连队的数量有所增加，质量也有很大提高。陆海空军在保卫领土、领海、领空的战斗中，在维护革命秩序、加强国防建设、民兵建设、国防科学技术研究、院校工作，以及发展农副业生产、参加社会主义革命和社会主义建设等方面，都取得了巨大的胜利。
    杨成武指出：所有这一切，都是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、大力突出政治的结果，都生动地证明了一个真理：精神可以变物质，革命的精神力量可以变为巨大的物质力量，用毛泽东思想武装起来的群众，是世界上最强大的力量。杨成武说：中国人民解放军是中国共产党和毛主席缔造和领导的工人农民的军队，是无产阶级专政的主要支柱。它无限忠诚于党，忠诚于人民，忠诚于毛主席，忠诚于毛泽东思想。在当前无产阶级文化大革命中，我军广大指战员和全国工农群众一起，奋勇当先，积极战斗，组成了文化革命的主力军，并在斗争中受到了极深刻的阶级教育。我们一定要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远站在保卫毛泽东思想的最前线，积极参加横扫一切牛鬼蛇神的战斗，把这场文化大革命进行到底，不获全胜，决不罢休。
    杨成武在讲话中强烈谴责美帝国主义进一步扩大侵略越南的罪行。他还严厉谴责现代修正主义者和反动派等美帝国主义的帮凶，四处奔走，出谋献策，公然为美帝国主义“以炸迫和”的阴谋效劳。他说：中国人民解放军坚决拥护刘少奇主席的七月二十二日声明，坚决支持胡志明主席的《告全国同胞书》。我们要警告美帝国主义，你们不要张牙舞爪，你们不过是中国人民和中国人民志愿军的手下败将，我们早已作好了一切准备，根据越南人民的利益，根据越南人民的要求，随时准备响应祖国的号召，同越南人民并肩作战，把侵略强盗坚决、彻底、全部、干净地消灭掉。
    杨成武最后强调说，我们一定要解放台湾，美帝国主义必须从台湾滚出去！
    在宴会上，罗马尼亚驻华大使馆武官索列斯库上校代表各国驻华武官，向中国人民解放军全体指战员表示热烈的节日祝贺。他说，中国人民在建设自己国家的事业中获得了伟大的成就。作为保卫中国人民既得成果的可靠捍卫者，中国人民解放军在战斗训练和政治教育中，在加强国家的国防能力中也取得了很大成就。
    他说，我们祝愿中国人民在建设新的幸福的生活中取得新的更大的成就；同时祝愿中国人民解放军在战斗和政治教育中，在保卫自己祖国——中华人民共和国——的事业中，获得新的成就。
    中国人民解放军各总部、各军种兵种的负责人萧劲光、粟裕、王树声、许光达、廖汉生、张爱萍、李天佑、王新亭、张宗逊、刘志坚、袁子钦、邱会作、李聚奎、杨勇、韩先楚、黄永胜、陈锡联、苏振华、吴法宪、余立金等出席了宴会。
