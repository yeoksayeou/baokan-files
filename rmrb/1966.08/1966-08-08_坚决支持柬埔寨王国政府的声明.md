    Firmly support the statement of the Royal Government of Cambodia
    In the just cause of opposing the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs, China will always be the most reliable friend of the Cambodian people
    New China News Agency, August 7th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China issued a statement on August 7th, firmly supporting the statement of the Royal Government of Cambodia on August 3rd regarding the repeated violations of Cambodian airspace by U.S. imperialist and South Vietnamese lackey aircraft, and the indiscriminate bombing of Cambodian border villages. The statement also strongly condemns the new aggression by the U.S. imperialists and their South Vietnamese lackeys.

    The full text of the statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China is as follows:

    Statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
    August 7, 1966

    On July 31st and August 2nd, U.S. imperialist and South Vietnamese lackey aircraft repeatedly violated Cambodian airspace, indiscriminately bombing border villages in the province of Pursat, resulting in the deaths of three innocent civilians and injuries to nine others, and causing severe destruction to peaceful villages. The Royal Government of Cambodia issued a statement on August 3rd, expressing the strongest protest against this and calling on peace-loving countries and peoples to take necessary measures to stop the aggression. The Chinese government and people firmly support the statement of the Royal Government of Cambodia and strongly condemn the new aggression by the U.S. imperialists and their South Vietnamese lackeys.

    The U.S. imperialists have consistently disregarded the peace, neutrality, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Cambodia, and have repeatedly carried out aggression against Cambodia. The Royal Government of Cambodia has repeatedly protested and warned against this, but the U.S. imperialists have ignored Cambodia's serious stance and taken even more brazen aggressive actions. The repeated bombing of Cambodian peaceful villages by U.S. aircraft shows that the U.S. imperialists will not abandon their ambition to invade Cambodia and are accelerating their reckless plan to expand the war of aggression in South Vietnam and its surrounding areas.

    It should be particularly pointed out that the U.S. imperialists' recent three consecutive violations of Cambodian territory occurred under the guise of Johnson's government's series of "friendly" gestures towards Cambodia. On August 2nd, the U.S. State Department just announced that Johnson's special envoy would go to Cambodia to discuss bilateral relations, and on the same day, U.S. imperialist and South Vietnamese lackey aircraft bombed Cambodia twice. The facts have ruthlessly exposed the hypocritical face of the Johnson government. It tells people that the U.S. imperialists' "nice words" are unreliable, and their aggressive nature will never change.

    The Chinese government and people firmly support the just struggle of the Cambodian government and people to defend national sovereignty, territorial integrity, and national dignity. We have always respected the peaceful and neutral policy of the Royal Government of Cambodia. Our position on this will not change. In the just cause of the Cambodian people opposing the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs, the Chinese people will always be the most reliable friends of the Cambodian people.

    我外交部发表声明强烈谴责美帝及其南越仆从新的侵略罪行
    坚决支持柬埔寨王国政府的声明
    在反对美帝及其走狗的正义事业中，中国将始终是柬埔寨人民最可信赖的朋友
    新华社七日讯　中国外交部七日发表声明，坚决支持柬埔寨王国政府三日就美帝国主义及其南越仆从的飞机连续侵犯柬埔寨领空，狂轰滥炸柬埔寨边境村庄发表的声明，并且强烈谴责美帝国主义及其南越仆从犯下的新的侵略罪行。
    中国外交部的声明全文如下：
    中华人民共和国外交部声明
                  一九六六年八月七日
    七月三十一日和八月二日，美帝国主义及其南越仆从的飞机，连续三次侵犯柬埔寨领空，对磅湛省的边境村庄进行狂轰滥炸，致使无辜居民三死、九伤，和平村庄惨遭破坏。柬埔寨王国政府于八月三日发表声明，对此提出最强烈的抗议，呼吁爱好和平的国家和人民，采取必要的措施，制止侵略。中国政府和人民，坚决支持柬埔寨王国政府的声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义及其南越仆从犯下的新的侵略罪行。
    美帝国主义一贯无视柬埔寨王国的和平、中立、主权和领土完整，不断对柬埔寨王国进行侵略。柬埔寨王国政府曾经对此多次提出抗议和警告，但是，美帝国主义竟无视柬埔寨王国的严正立场，采取了更加猖狂的侵略行动。美国飞机对柬埔寨和平村庄的连续轰炸，表明美帝国主义决不会放弃侵略柬埔寨的野心，并且正在加紧推行它在南越和南越周围扩大侵略战争的冒险计划。
    应该特别指出，美帝国主义最近接连三次对柬埔寨领土的侵犯，是在约翰逊政府向柬埔寨作出一系列“友好”的姿态下发生的。八月二日，美国国务院刚刚宣布约翰逊的特使将到柬埔寨会谈两国关系问题，同一天，美帝国主义及其南越仆从的飞机就两次对柬埔寨进行轰炸。事实已经无情地揭露了约翰逊政府的虚伪面目。它告诉人们，美帝国主义的“好话”是靠不住的，它的侵略本性是绝对不会改变的。
    中国政府和中国人民坚决支持柬埔寨政府和柬埔寨人民维护国家主权、领土完整和民族尊严的正义斗争，一贯尊重柬埔寨王国政府的和平中立政策。我们的这一立场是不会改变的。在柬埔寨人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的正义事业中，中国人民将始终是柬埔寨人民最可信赖的朋友。
