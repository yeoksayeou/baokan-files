The great leader Chairman Mao has called on the entire nation to learn from the People's Liberation Army. This call is being increasingly implemented by Red Guards and revolutionary youth across the country. Red Guards everywhere have expressed their determination to learn from the PLA, to study Chairman Mao's thoughts, to implement Chairman Mao's thoughts, to propagate Chairman Mao's thoughts, to defend Chairman Mao's thoughts, and to use Chairman Mao's thoughts to guide all their actions. They are daring to revolutionize, skilled at revolutionizing, and are pushing the storm of smashing the "Four Olds" to new heights, determined to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The broad masses of Red Guards and revolutionary youth are indeed the most resolute in responding to Chairman Mao's call and the most serious in learning from the PLA. After the publication of the *People's Daily* editorial "Revolutionary Youth Must Learn from the PLA," Red Guards and revolutionary youth in the capital and across the country have swiftly taken action. Some are studying the editorial while summarizing their experiences from the previous phase of the Cultural Revolution and formulating new action plans. Others are learning the PLA's three rules of discipline and eight points for attention, studying relevant policies of the Party and the state, and resolving to become models in executing discipline and policies, building the Red Guards into a highly organized and disciplined revolutionary youth force. Still others are studying Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle and the "Sixteen Points," taking to the streets to propagate the "Sixteen Points," determined to make them known to every household and deeply ingrained in people's hearts. Through studying the editorial, Red Guards across the country have become even more spirited, filled with the resolve to learn revolution through revolution, determined to temper themselves into steadfast proletarian fighters in the midst of great storms.

Revolutionary youth in the capital, filled with great revolutionary enthusiasm, are studying and discussing the editorial. Many Red Guards are broadcasting the editorial on buses, trams, and main streets. Revolutionary youth say that the Party's call for revolutionary youth to learn from the PLA is the greatest care for the growth of revolutionary youth, the greatest trust in revolutionary youth, and the strongest support for revolutionary youth's revolutionary actions. Red Guards from Peking University say: The PLA is the bravest in fighting class enemies and the most loving towards the masses. Learning from the PLA means daring to rebel against all bourgeois, revisionist, and feudal elements, while also being skilled at revolution, loving the masses, and elevating the struggle to the level of the "Sixteen Points." Red Guards from the Second Middle School in Beijing recently issued a declaration of war against the old world, filled with revolutionary fervor. In their struggles, they often compare themselves with the PLA to improve themselves. They believe that only by acting decisively according to Chairman Mao's instructions and the Party's policies can they be invincible. Many Red Guards from Dongfanghong Fourth Middle School say: Learning from the PLA is not just about wearing military uniforms; it is about reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, becoming good soldiers of Chairman Mao. After studying the editorial, some Red Guards from Dongfanghong Middle School (formerly the 28th Middle School) in Beijing, taking the PLA as an example, revised and supplemented the original nine rules for Red Guards. They especially emphasize becoming servants of the people, forever executing the three rules of discipline and eight points for attention.

Many revolutionary students in universities and colleges in Shanghai today seriously discussed the editorial of the *People's Daily*. They resolved to most resolutely and enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's great call, to learn from the PLA, and to become good soldiers of Chairman Mao. Students from East China Normal University said in their discussion: The PLA listens to Chairman Mao's words the most and is a good example of studying Chairman Mao's works actively. We Red Guards want to destroy the old world and build a new world, so we must take the PLA as an example. Students from the Shanghai Theatre Academy said today in a meeting: The PLA has faithfully executed Chairman Mao's three rules of discipline and eight points for attention, so it has become an army loved by the people and invincible. In the Cultural Revolution, we Red Guards must, like the PLA, faithfully execute the three rules of discipline and eight points for attention, observe discipline, protect the people's interests, and protect state property. Many students from Jiao Tong University also enthusiastically discussed the editorial of the *People's Daily*. A Red Guard said, Chairman Mao personally formulated the "Sixteen Points" as our guide to action. We must, like the PLA, most resolutely execute Chairman Mao's instructions and, in the Cultural Revolution, act decisively according to the "Sixteen Points." We must insist on struggle without violence.

Red Guards in Kaifeng are using the "Sixteen Points" as a guide to observe, direct, and transform everything. Many Red Guards carry the "Sixteen Points" and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with them, propagating them wherever they go, actively suggesting reforms for names reflecting the "Four Olds," and carefully protecting cultural relics and ancient sites. When Red Guards came to "Yuwangtai Park," they proposed four suggestions to the staff: change the park's name to Kaifeng People's Park, erect a giant portrait of Chairman Mao at the entrance, write Chairman Mao's quotations on the walls inside, and add critical explanations next to cultural relics and ancient tablets. The park staff immediately responded. As a result, the "Sixteen Points" have become even more deeply ingrained in people's hearts and have been warmly supported by the masses.

Today, thousands of Red Guard propagandists in Shenyang are continuously propagating the "Sixteen Points" on the streets. Red Guards have expressed their determination to learn from the PLA and to execute Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's policies in the struggle.

Red Guards from universities and colleges in Nanjing today all seriously studied the editorial of the *People's Daily*. Some schools' Red Guards went out to the streets with drums and gongs to propagate learning from the PLA. They said, after studying the editorial of the *People's Daily*, our resolve is greater, our direction is clearer, and our fighting spirit is stronger. Red Guards from Nanjing Medical College said: We Red Guards listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. Whatever is in line with Mao Zedong Thought and the spirit of the "Sixteen Points," we will follow even if it means climbing mountains of knives and crossing seas of fire; whatever goes against Mao Zedong Thought and the "Sixteen Points," we will firmly oppose.

In Guangzhou today, Red Guards are leading the masses in reciting Chairman Mao's quotations, propagating the "Sixteen Points," and the great significance of the Cultural Revolution everywhere.

Red Guards from the Mongolian ethnic group in Hohhot's Workers-Peasants-Soldiers Middle School said: We must take the PLA as an example in everything. The PLA's three rules of discipline and eight points for attention are our three rules of discipline and eight points for attention. The PLA's three-eight work style is our work style. Revolutionary students from Guiyang Girls' Middle School expressed their determination to learn from the PLA, especially to learn from them how to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to be like Wang Jie and Liu Yingjun, doing as Chairman Mao says.

Red Guards from Peking University, with immense excitement, seriously studied the editorial "Revolutionary Youth Must Learn from the PLA" published by the *People's Daily* on August 28, resolving to be like the PLA, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide all their actions.

    据新华社二十八日讯　我们的伟大领袖毛主席关于全国人民都要学习解放军的伟大号召，正在越来越广泛地成为全国各地红卫兵和革命青少年的实际行动。各地红卫兵们纷纷表示，他们一定要像解放军那样，努力学习毛泽东思想，坚决贯彻毛泽东思想，积极宣传毛泽东思想，勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想指导自己的一切行动，敢于革命，善于革命，把横扫“四旧”的斗争风暴推向新的高峰，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    广大红卫兵和革命的青少年，不愧为最坚决地响应毛主席的号召、最认真地向解放军学习的好榜样。今天，《人民日报》的社论《革命青少年要向解放军学习》发表以后，首都和全国各地红卫兵和革命青少年闻风而动，说干就干。他们有的一面认真学习《人民日报》社论，一面认真总结前一段开展无产阶级文化大革命的经验，制定新的行动计划；有的学习了解放军的三大纪律八项注意，学习了党和国家的有关政策，决心要像解放军那样成为执行群众纪律、执行党和国家政策的模范，把红卫兵建设成为具有高度组织性纪律性的革命青少年队伍；有的再一次学习了毛主席有关阶级、阶级斗争理论的语录和十六条，并且涌上街头大张旗鼓地宣传十六条，决心要让十六条家喻户晓，深入人心。经过对《人民日报》社论的学习，各地红卫兵们的革命精神更加振奋，充满了在革命中学会革命的决心，一定要在大风大浪中把自己锻炼成为坚强的无产阶级战士。
    首都广大革命青少年怀着极大的革命热情，纷纷学习和讨论《人民日报》社论。许多红卫兵在公共汽车、电车上，在主要街道上，不断向群众广播这篇社论。革命青少年说，党号召革命青少年向解放军学习，这是对革命青少年成长的最大关怀，是对革命青少年的最大信任，是对革命青少年的革命行动的最强有力的支持。北京大学的红卫兵们说：解放军同阶级敌人斗争最勇敢，对群众最热爱，学习解放军，就敢于造一切资产阶级、修正主义、封建主义的反，同时又善于革命，热爱人民群众，把斗争提到十六条的纲上来。北京二中的红卫兵不久前发出了充满革命豪情的向旧世界的宣战书，他们在斗争中经常对照解放军总结工作，提高自己。他们认为，只有像解放军那样，坚决按照毛主席的指示和党的政策办事，才能攻无不克，战无不胜。东方红四中的许多红卫兵说：学习解放军，不光是穿军装，最重要的是要像解放军那样，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。北京市东方红中学（原第二十八中）的部分红卫兵学习了这篇社论后，以解放军为榜样，重新修改、补充了原订的红卫兵九条纪律。他们特别强调要像解放军那样，全心全意为人民服务，永远做人民的勤务员，坚决执行三大纪律八项注意。

    开封市的红卫兵们以十六条为指针观察一切、指导一切、改造一切。许多红卫兵随身带着十六条和《毛主席语录》，走到哪里宣传到哪里，看到反映“四旧”的名称就积极建议改革，同时认真保护文物、古迹。红卫兵们来到“禹王台公园”，向职工提出四项建议：把园名改为开封人民公园，在门口树立毛主席巨幅画像，园内墙上写上毛主席语录；在文物、古碑旁加上批判说明。公园职工立即响应。红卫兵们这样做的结果，十六条更加深入人心，受到了群众的热烈拥护。
