The Central Committee's Communiqué Has Stirred the Revolutionary Spirit of the People Nationwide

The broad masses enthusiastically cheer: Our beloved Chairman Mao, with your wise leadership and the great thought of Mao Zedong, we can dispel the clouds, steer the right course, break through any stormy waves, and forever sail forward!

Xinhua News Agency, August 15: The series of wise decisions made by our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao since the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee have brought about a revolutionary scene of vigorous activity and a new leap forward in all aspects for our great motherland. In the recent wave of nationwide celebrations for the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, the 700 million people of the entire country enthusiastically celebrate the current excellent situation, determined to continue to forge ahead along the revolutionary path opened by Chairman Mao, and stride into a new stage of socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country.

Since the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee was issued, celebrations have been held in all 28 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, from cities to rural areas, with waves of joy surging higher and higher. In the celebrations and rallies held in various places, people reviewed the road that the people of our country have traveled under the leadership of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao in the past four years, and they all felt boundless joy and happiness. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres loudly cheered at many celebration rallies:

"Our beloved Chairman Mao, you are our greatest, wisest, bravest, and most talented helmsman!"

"Our beloved Chairman Mao, with your wise leadership and the great thought of Mao Zedong as our guide, we can dispel the clouds, steer the right course, break through any stormy waves, and forever sail forward!"

The communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, which embodies the new developments and victories of Mao Zedong Thought, has greatly inspired the revolutionary spirit of the people throughout the country. People believe that the Eighth Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, presided over by Chairman Mao, has made the most comprehensive, systematic, and profound scientific judgments on the domestic and international situation, and has issued the most wise, correct, and timely call to arms for the forward march of the people of the entire country. Workers in factories and mines, commune members, military personnel, cadre, and students in various places have listed a large number of personal experiences at celebration rallies to illustrate that as long as we hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, there will be no insurmountable difficulties on our forward path, no shoals or reefs that we cannot navigate, and we can create any miracles in the world.

The workers of Daqing Oil Field, who started with Mao Zedong's "On Contradiction" and "On Practice" and set a brilliant example for the people of the entire country to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, feel particularly close to the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee. The "Iron Man" of Daqing, Wang Jinxi, and many other Daqing people excitedly pointed out that Daqing Oil Field, following Chairman Mao's instruction to take class struggle as the key link, has combined revolution with production, and has achieved great successes in the ideological transformation of people and the construction of the oil field in recent years. The victorious path that Daqing Oil Field has traveled is the path indicated by Chairman Mao. They expressed that in the future, they will read Chairman Mao's books more carefully, listen to Chairman Mao's words, take Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle for all work, and make Daqing Oil Field better and stronger, turning Daqing Oil Field into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The news of the communiqué reached Dazhai Brigade in Shanyin County, Shanxi Province, and the people of Dazhai had a particularly strong reaction. They said that all the achievements they have made in recent years are fundamentally because they have resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's various major decisions. Party Secretary Chen Yonggui said, after hearing the communiqué of the Central Committee, his mind is clearer, his eyes are brighter, and his heart is more enlightened. The communiqué has pointed out a new direction and new targets for us. We must resolutely respond to the call of the communiqué, with the greatest determination, take the People's Liberation Army as an example, learn from advanced units throughout the country, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, let the great thought of Mao Zedong be passed down from generation to generation, and ensure that our socialist iron fortress will never change color.

The three poor peasants, Wang Yukun, Wang Xiaqi, and Wang Xiaopang, from Nanwang Village, Anping County, Hebei Province, who were praised by Chairman Mao as the "direction of 500 million peasants," wrote a letter to the Central Committee and Chairman Mao after the communiqué was issued, saying that from 1954 when they took the cooperative path to the present, they have followed the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, carried forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, striving for progress, and hard struggle, and fought one battle after another against class enemies, old habits, and nature, overcoming one difficulty after another and achieving one victory after another. This is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Now, Nanwang Village has fundamentally changed its past poor and backward appearance and has become a brand-new socialist new countryside. We poor and lower-middle peasants have, through our personal experiences, thought about the past and compared it with the present, and have an even greater love for the great Party and an even greater love for the great leader Chairman Mao. The letter said, at a time when our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction are further deepening and developing, the Central Committee and Chairman Mao have once again pointed out the direction for us to advance. We firmly support the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee and firmly respond to the great call of the communiqué. We will join hands with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers throughout the country, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and strive forward for the victory of the cause of socialism and communism in our country.

The soldiers of the "Eighth Company on Nanjing Road" who are currently conducting field training were elated after hearing the broadcast of the communiqué. The soldiers recalled the company and their own experiences of growing up in the storms of class struggle in recent years, and discussed the correctness and greatness of Chairman Mao's theory on the contradictions, classes, and class struggle in socialist society. The soldiers said, in the past, the bourgeoisie used all kinds of vile and malicious means to try to make the Eighth Company go moldy and black on Nanjing Road. The Eighth Company, relying on the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, resisted the evil winds and poisonous gas on Nanjing Road, and smashed their plot of "peaceful evolution." At a time of intense class struggle, the Eighth Company firmly remembered Chairman Mao's great instruction to "never forget class struggle," kept their eyes clear and their feet firm, and repelled the attacks of the class enemies one after another. Countless facts have shown that reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and resolutely acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions can always stand unshakable in the struggle to promote the proletariat and eliminate the bourgeoisie, and achieve a thorough victory. The soldiers unanimously expressed that they would resolutely follow the direction indicated by the communiqué, in the new stage of socialist revolution, in the struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, study to a new level, use to a new level, and make the Eighth Company, this great school of Mao Zedong Thought, even better, forever following Chairman Mao to make revolution.

The revolutionary teachers and students of Peking University, after the communiqué was issued, with great revolutionary passion, came in groups from dozens of miles away to the reception station for the masses at the location of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, to express their determination to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. They said, the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution at Peking University was personally ignited by the great leader Chairman Mao, and the revolutionary teachers and students of Peking University will resolutely follow the instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, overthrow, smash, and expose the capitalist roaders in power, thoroughly criticize the reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, reform the old educational system, and build a new Peking University of the proletariat. At a meeting held in the school, Nie Yuanzi, the chairman of the Cultural Revolution Committee of Peking University, expressed that the revolutionary teachers and students of Peking University enthusiastically respond to the call of the communiqué, and will further launch a mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works throughout the school, using Mao Zedong Thought, this sharpest weapon, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

At present, the wave of cheers for the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is expanding to every corner of the country on an even broader scale. The communiqué, which embodies the new developments of Mao Zedong Thought, is turning into the great material force of the 700 million people to "dare to change the heavens and the earth."

    自从党的八届十一中全会公报发表以来，在全国二十八个省、市、自治区，从城市到农村，到处都在举行庆祝活动，欢乐的浪潮一浪高过一浪。在各地举行的庆祝游行中和集会上，人们回顾我国人民近四年来在党中央和毛主席领导下所走过的道路，莫不感到无限欢欣，无限幸福。广大工农兵群众、革命知识分子和革命干部，在许多庆祝集会上放声欢呼：

    体现了毛泽东思想的新发展和新胜利的党的八届十一中全会公报，极大地振奋了全国人民的革命豪情。人们认为，毛主席亲自主持的党的八届十一中全会，对国内国际形势作出了最全面、最系统、最深刻的科学论断，对全国人民的前进方向发出了最英明、最正确、最及时的战斗号召。各地的厂矿职工、公社社员、部队指战员、机关干部和学校师生，纷纷在庆祝集会上列举大量切身经历的事实说明，只要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在我们的前进道路上就没有不可克服的困难，就没有绕不过的险滩和暗礁，就可以创造出任何的人间奇迹来。
    靠毛主席的《矛盾论》和《实践论》起家、为全国人民活学活用毛主席著作树立了光辉榜样的大庆油田职工，对党的八届十一中全会公报特别感到亲切。大庆“铁人”王进喜和许多大庆人兴奋地指出，大庆油田遵照毛主席以阶级斗争为纲的教导，抓革命促生产，几年来在人的思想革命化和油田建设上取得了伟大的成就。大庆油田所走过的胜利道路，就是毛主席指引的道路。他们表示，今后要更好地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，把毛泽东思想作为一切工作的指导方针，让大庆油田越变越好，越变越强，把大庆油田办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    公报的喜讯传到山西昔阳县大寨大队，大寨人的反应特别强烈。他们说，他们几年来取得的一切成就，最根本的一条，就是因为坚决贯彻执行了毛主席提出的各项重大决策。党支部书记陈永贵说，听了党中央公报，脑子更灵，眼睛更明，心更亮了。公报给我们指出了新的前进方向，新的战斗目标。我们要坚决响应公报的号召，要用最大的决心，以解放军为榜样，向全国一切先进单位学习，活学活用毛主席著作，让伟大的毛泽东思想代代相传，保证我们的社会主义铁打江山永不变色。

    北京大学革命师生在公报发表后，怀着巨大的革命激情，成群结队从几十里外赶到中共中央所在地的群众接待站，表达他们一定要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的坚强决心。他们说，北京大学无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火是伟大领袖毛主席亲自点燃的，北大革命师生坚决按照伟大领袖毛主席的指示，斗倒、斗垮、斗臭走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底批判反动的资产阶级学术“权威”，改革旧的教育制度，建设一个无产阶级的社会主义新北大。北京大学文化革命委员会筹委会主任聂元梓在学校里举行的一次集会上表示，北大的革命师生热烈响应公报提出的号召，要在全校进一步掀起一个活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，运用毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
