	Long live Chairman Mao forever!
	Beijing Xicheng District, Bolue Alley, Residents of Number 25

	The vast ocean relies on the helmsman,
	All things grow with the sun,
	Rain and dew nourish the crops,
	To make revolution, we rely on Mao Zedong Thought.

	Whenever we sing this song, we think of our great leader, Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is the eternal red sun in our hearts. How we long to see Chairman Mao! Every time we see his benevolent face on the screen, we are moved to tears. Seeing Chairman Mao is our highest wish.

	Our wish has finally come true! On the evening of August 10, as everyone was having dinner, the joyous news suddenly arrived, “Chairman Mao has come!” Everyone was overjoyed upon hearing this news, dropping their bowls and chopsticks, and rushing towards the reception stand.

	At this moment, the sound of drums, slogans, and songs filled the air on Furong Street. Everyone could not contain their excitement, holding up their red flags and shouting from the bottom of their hearts, “Long live Chairman Mao!” “Chairman Mao, long live forever!!”

	Chairman Mao ascended the platform of the reception stand, and the excited crowd surged forward to the platform. Chairman Mao’s face was radiant, and he was full of vigor. He would wave to the crowd and clap his hands from time to time. Among us, junior high school students Ying Zhixin and Yang Jianghong also pushed their way to the platform, holding up their hands to shake hands with Chairman Mao. He held the hands that were stretched out to him. Chairman Mao’s warm hands tightly grasped ours. Instantly, we felt a surge of warmth throughout our bodies, and our blood boiled with energy, making us feel invincible.

	Seeing Chairman Mao’s ruddy face and his tall, sturdy figure, we felt immense happiness and pride. Chairman Mao’s health is the greatest happiness for the Chinese people and the greatest happiness for the people of the world.

	The shouts of “Long live Chairman Mao!” echoed in the crowd for a long time. After Chairman Mao got into the car, people still did not want to leave. The car started, and we followed closely behind, hoping to see Chairman Mao again. Even a glance would be good! The car entered Zhongnanhai, and people were still cheering, immersed in the happy memories, with slogans echoing in the sky.

	Everyone returned home but could not calm down. Chairman Mao’s great and benevolent image was deeply engraved in everyone’s mind. The hands of Ying Zhixin and Yang Jianghong, who had shaken hands with Chairman Mao, were now tightly grasped by many others. An old worker commanded, “You are not allowed to wash your hands.” A young worker tightly grasped Yang Jianghong’s hand and said, “I hope you will not disappoint Chairman Mao’s expectations. This hand that has shaken Chairman Mao’s should also strive to be the first in class struggle and production struggle!”

	It was deep into the night, but everyone was too excited to sleep. Many people wrote down their diaries of the happiest and most meaningful day of their lives. Everyone made a resolution: Chairman Mao, we will forever follow you, read your books, listen to your words, and be your good soldiers and students. We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

	Everyone shouted from the heart with the same voice:

	Long live Chairman Mao forever!
	Long live Chairman Mao!

　　祝毛主席万寿无疆
　　北京西城区博学胡同二十五号居民
    大海航行靠舵手，
    万物生长靠太阳，
    雨露滋润禾苗壮，
    干革命靠的是毛泽东思想。
    我们一唱这首歌，就想到了伟大的领袖毛主席。毛主席是我们心中永远不落的红太阳。我们是多么想见到毛主席啊！每当在银幕上看到他老人家慈祥的面容，我们就激动得热泪盈眶。看到毛主席，这是我们心中最崇高的愿望。
    愿望终于实现了！八月十日傍晚，大家正在吃饭，喜讯突然传来，“毛主席来了！”大家听到这个喜讯简直乐坏了，扔下碗筷，一齐向接待站飞奔而去。
    这时，府右街上锣鼓声、口号声、歌声响彻云霄。每个人都抑制不住自己心中的激动，大家高举起手中的红旗，喊出发自内心的呼声：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！！”
    毛主席登上了接待站的讲台，激动的人群也一直拥到讲台前。毛主席满面红光，神采奕奕，他老人家时而向大家招手，时而向大家鼓掌。我们之中的初中学生英志新、杨江洪也拥到讲台前，高高举起手想和毛主席握手。他老人家握住一双双伸过来的手。毛主席那双温暖的手，紧紧握住我们的手。顿时我们感到一股暖流直冲全身，全身的热血也沸腾起来了，觉得浑身增加使不完的力量。
    看着毛主席那红润的面孔，看着毛主席那高大、魁梧的身体，我们心中感到无限幸福和骄傲。毛主席身体这样健康，这是中国人民的最大幸福，也是世界人民的最大幸福。
    “毛主席万岁”的欢呼声一直在人群中回荡了很久。毛主席坐上汽车后，人们还不肯离去。汽车开动了，我们紧紧跟着汽车，多么渴望再见到毛主席呀！就是再多看一眼也好啊！汽车开进了中南海，人们还在欢呼，沉浸在幸福的回忆中，口号声一直在上空回荡。
    大家回到家里，怎么也平静不下来，毛主席伟大慈祥的形象，深深地刻在大家的脑海中。和毛主席握过手的英志新、杨江洪的手，现在又被许多人紧紧地握住了。有一个老工人下命令似地说：“可不准你们洗手。”还有一个青年工人紧紧握住杨江洪的手说：“希望你不辜负毛主席的期望。和毛主席握过的这只手，以后在阶级斗争、生产斗争中也要争当第一把手呀！”
    夜深了，大家都兴奋地不想睡，许多人都写下了一生最幸福、最有意义的一天的日记。大家下定决心：毛主席，我们永远跟着您，读您的书，听您的话，做您的好战士、好学生。我们一定要永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    大家从心中喊出了同一个声音：
    祝毛主席万寿无疆！
    毛主席万岁！
