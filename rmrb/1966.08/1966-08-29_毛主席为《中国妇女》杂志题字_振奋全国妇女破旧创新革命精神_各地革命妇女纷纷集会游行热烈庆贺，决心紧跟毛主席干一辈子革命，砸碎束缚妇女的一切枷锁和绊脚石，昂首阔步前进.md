Chairman Mao inscribes for "Women of China" magazine, inspiring revolutionary spirit nationwide among women
Women revolutionaries across the country hold rallies and parades to celebrate, vowing to follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life, smashing all shackles and obstacles that bind women, and marching forward with heads held high.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 28th, the news that our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao inscribed for "Women of China" magazine has greatly inspired revolutionary women across the country. In recent days, revolutionary women from various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have carried large portraits of Chairman Mao, beating drums and gongs, to report the good news to the party committees and women's federations of their respective provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. Many places have also held grand celebration rallies and parades. They solemnly declare to the party and Chairman Mao: We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, forever study Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We will forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution, tempering ourselves into extremely proletarian and extremely militant revolutionaries in the midst of great storms and waves.

Revolutionary women in the capital have been flocking to the reception center of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the All-China Women's Federation to celebrate in recent days, filled with immense excitement. At the reception center of the All-China Women's Federation, there is a gold-edged red frame with red satin draped over it, inside which are Chairman Mao's powerful and vigorous characters "Women of China." These four brilliant characters have aroused enthusiastic cheers from all the revolutionary women who have come to report the good news. Many revolutionary women expressed in their reports of joy that Chairman Mao's inscription for "Women of China" is the greatest concern, support, and encouragement from our most beloved and great leader to all revolutionary women across the country. One report of joy said: "The birth of the new 'Women of China' is Chairman Mao's order to bury the old world and a call to create a new world for all revolutionary women across the country." Another report of joy said: "August 20th is the most memorable day for revolutionary women in China, and it will forever be etched in our hearts."

In Shanghai, Hangzhou, Fuzhou, Nanchang, Baoding, Changsha, Wuhan, Guiyang, Changchun, as well as in Jiangsu and Shandong, thousands upon thousands of revolutionary women have held celebration rallies or taken to the streets in recent days, enthusiastically cheering Chairman Mao's inscription for "Women of China" magazine. They said that this is our great leader Chairman Mao's hope and concern for Chinese women, and we must carry forward the spirit of revolutionary rebellion in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, smashing all the ugly things of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism that poison women. On the 25th, from early morning to late night, revolutionary women in Shanghai, filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, beat drums and gongs, holding high portraits of Chairman Mao and quotations boards, batch after batch, went to the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China to declare their resolve. Some leaders of the Shanghai Municipal Women's Federation, together with revolutionary female cadres from the city, district, and county levels, went to the reception center of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China to declare on behalf of all revolutionary women in Shanghai: We will firmly respond to Chairman Mao's call and definitely turn the revolutionary women's organizations in Shanghai into a great school of revolution.

The news reached Fangxing Brigade in Hanzhong County, Jiangsu Province, where female community members eagerly read the newspaper featuring Chairman Mao's personal inscription, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" They said: Chairman Mao's characters, we see them with our eyes, and they are red in our hearts. We are deeply grateful to our great leader Chairman Mao for his greatest concern, encouragement, and support for all revolutionary women across the country.

Women of various ethnic groups in Lhasa, Yinchuan, Nanning, Hohhot, and Urumqi enthusiastically cheered the great concern of our great leader Chairman Mao for all revolutionary women. On the 25th, women from various ethnic groups in Lhasa carried a giant portrait of Chairman Mao and marched in the streets despite heavy rain. Various ethnic revolutionary female workers of the Tibet Women's Federation declared their resolve: We Tibetan revolutionary women will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to the Party, and loyal to the people. We will forever follow our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, marching forward with heads held high, turning the Tibet Women's Federation into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. On the 27th, more than 20,000 Hui and Han revolutionary women in Yinchuan held a grand celebration rally and parade. Many revolutionary women spoke at the meeting, expressing their determination to listen to Chairman Mao's words and, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, use Mao Zedong Thought, this invincible powerful ideological weapon, to launch a fierce attack on all old ideas, old cultures, old customs, and old habits, thoroughly smashing the spiritual shackles and all obstacles that bind the hands and feet of revolutionary women, taking firm revolutionary steps, and following Chairman Mao in revolution for life.

The news reached the headquarters and units of the People's Liberation Army Air Force and Railway Corps in Beijing, where female soldiers and female cadres jumped for joy, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" Some held symposiums, some wrote articles and put up blackboard newspapers to celebrate, and some organized reporting teams to go to the All-China Women's Federation and the Party Central Committee's reception center to congratulate. Female soldiers and female cadres also studied the Mao Zedong quotation published that day in the "People's Daily" and the "Liberation Army Daily": "The day women across the country rise up is the day of victory for the Chinese revolution." They said: Chairman Mao cares most about the masses and cares most about us women. Chairman Mao's high evaluation of our role in the revolution is the greatest encouragement to us. We must cherish our responsibilities, carry forward the daring, daring to do, daring to rebel, and daring to make revolution spirit of the proletarian revolution, charging into the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, being vanguards, and pioneers, thoroughly burying the old world and creating a brand-new world.
