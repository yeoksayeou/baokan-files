The Central Committee's decision to mass produce Chairman Mao's works is the greatest political concern for the masses

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other major cities have enthusiastically welcomed this great event. They have expressed their determination to read Chairman Mao's books more diligently, listen to Chairman Mao's words, learn better, and use them better, to thoroughly criticize the old world and create a new world.

According to Xinhua News Agency, August 8th, after the news of the Central Committee's decision to accelerate the mass production of Chairman Mao's works was announced, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other major cities were overjoyed. They rushed to share the news and enthusiastically celebrated this great event for the people of our country, hailing it as another great victory in the Cultural Revolution.

The joyous news sparked enthusiastic cheers from the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals in the capital. People spontaneously shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works!" Program Bao, a steelworker from the Beijing Steel Plant and a member of the factory's Cultural Revolution Committee, said, "The Central Committee's decision to mass produce Chairman Mao's works is a great event for the people of the entire nation and another great victory for our Cultural Revolution. We workers support it wholeheartedly and are overjoyed. Mao Zedong Thought is the red sun in our hearts and the lifeblood of our existence. We workers, peasants, and soldiers must occupy the cultural front, strengthen and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and always learn from Chairman Mao's works, for a lifetime, and use them for a lifetime, to thoroughly carry out the Cultural Revolution to the end."

Soldiers guarding Tiananmen Square were having breakfast when they heard the news. They immediately cheered, saying, "We have been waiting for this day, month after month, even dreaming of buying a set of 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong.' Now our wish has come true. This is indeed a great event and a great victory for the Cultural Revolution. We are soldiers guarding Tiananmen Square and must hold a set of 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong,' think of the world revolution, stand in front of Tiananmen Square, with our hearts in our country, and our eyes on the world."

The news spread to colleges and universities where the Cultural Revolution was in full swing, and revolutionary teachers and students were overjoyed. Big-character posters praising the Central Committee's wise decision sprouted up like bamboo after a rain. Revolutionary teachers and students at Peking University immediately put up big-character posters as soon as they heard the news, spreading the news far and wide. Officials and community members of the Huangtu Gang People's Commune in the suburbs heard the joyous news from the radio and immediately burst into cheers. Many poor and lower-middle peasants excitedly said, "We have been waiting for the stars and the moon, hoping to get Chairman Mao's books, and now we are finally going to get them!" Many officials and community members said, "From now on, we will study and apply Chairman Mao's works even better, hold Chairman Mao's books in our hands, and keep Mao Zedong Thought forever in our minds."

The news reached the famous Dazhai-style enterprise, the Shanghai Third Iron and Steel Plant. Chen Fu, the chief engineer of the converter workshop, known as the "Iron Man," excitedly said, "Our workers' long-cherished wish has come true. This is a fatal blow to the anti-party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought clique and a great victory for our Cultural Revolution." Chen De, a model worker from the plant, angrily denounced the crimes of a handful of capitalist representatives who had infiltrated the party and obstructed the revolutionary people from studying Chairman Mao's works. He said, "Two years ago, we twenty-three people organized a study group to study Chairman Mao's works, but we couldn't buy 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong.' We managed to borrow a set and persisted in studying it. Now, the Central Committee has decided to accelerate the mass production of Chairman Mao's works. We will study even better and use them even better, using the great Mao Zedong Thought to thoroughly criticize the old world and create a new world."

It is our revolutionary weapon and more precious than anything else."
