	Study Chairman Mao's Works, Become a Revolutionary Farmer
	Chen Jinfu, Member of the Dalu Production Brigade

	Previously, I was deeply influenced by the bad ideas of the exploiting classes of the old society. My vision was short-sighted, and I had a lot of selfish thoughts. In 1963, the brigade sent me to the mountains to an abandoned mine to dig for ore and engage in sideline production. Once, after finding an ore vein, I dug out the ore and buried it in another place. When I returned to the production brigade, I told the cadres that I hadn't found any ore. During the Spring Festival holiday, I went to the mountain, dug out the ore, and secretly sold it, putting all the money into my own pocket. Last year, during the socialist education movement in the brigade, I began to realize that what I did was wrong. However, because I was afraid of losing face, I didn't dare to speak out about this matter. My heart was troubled, and I couldn't eat or sleep well. Should I speak out or not? My thoughts were constantly at war. It was at this time that the brigade organized the members to study Chairman Mao's works. One evening, the instructor Luo Musen gave us a lecture on the article "In Memory of Norman Bethune." After the class, I couldn't put it out of my mind. Chairman Mao's eight words, "completely selfless and dedicated to others," were like a mirror, making my heart beat wildly. I tossed and turned, unable to sleep, and thought about many past events. In the old society, I was a poor peasant who had suffered greatly. During the land reform, apart from a broken earthen pot and a torn bamboo hat, I had nothing. It was all thanks to the Party's leadership that my family of six now has no worries about hunger or cold, and our lives are getting better and better. I went against Chairman Mao's instructions and did things that were selfish and not for the benefit of others. How could I face the Communist Party and Chairman Mao? The more I thought about it, the more ashamed I felt, and I decided to confess my mistake to the members. At first, my wife didn't understand. I said, "Bad thoughts must be exposed to the sunlight. Changing them secretly is not effective. It's better to firmly follow Chairman Mao's words, admit mistakes when wrong, and speak out to change. The sooner you speak out, the better!"

	Thus, at a members' meeting, I spoke out about hiding the ore. At that time, I thought I would at least receive a severe criticism. Unexpectedly, everyone praised me, saying that I listened to Chairman Mao's words and dared to fight against my own selfishness; saying that I studied Chairman Mao's works and put effort into "practice." This made me feel both sad and sweet, with a warm sensation throughout my body. I thought, Chairman Mao's leadership is truly wise and great, and the revolutionary collective family is infinitely warm!

	From then on, my mind was open, and my vision was broad. I made a firm decision to study Chairman Mao's works more diligently, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. I must thoroughly overcome selfishness and establish public-mindedness, becoming a revolutionary farmer. Last winter, the thatch on my family's pigsty had not been replaced for many years and was rotten. When it rained, the two pigs were soaked, shivering all day. My wife called me several times to ask for leave to go to the mountain to cut thatch and rebuild the roof. At that time, it was the busiest time for the brigade to plow the frost-covered fields. Asking for leave to cut thatch would mean not being able to concentrate on plowing the frost-covered fields; plowing the frost-covered fields would mean not being able to cut thatch. What should I do? I remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: when faced with a task, do not think of yourself first! Plowing the frost-covered fields is a major collective production task, and repairing the pigsty, no matter how important, is a minor personal matter. How could I put personal interests first and ignore the collective interests? So, I followed Chairman Mao's instructions and devoted myself wholeheartedly to plowing the frost-covered fields.

	In the past, I had another major flaw: I always protected myself, fearing that others would speak ill of me. Therefore, when some people harmed the collective for personal gain, worked without regard for quality, or when cadres did things unfairly, I knew and saw it but did not speak up or intervene, for fear of losing face. At that time, the members all said I was a "coward." After studying the article "Oppose Liberalism," I realized that "not meddling in others' affairs" and fearing to lose face was pure selfishness. Chairman Mao said, "The source of liberalism lies in the selfishness of the petty bourgeoisie, who place personal interests first and revolutionary interests second." Chairman Mao's words were like speaking directly to Chen Jinfu, hitting my heart with every sentence. I thought, to thoroughly overcome selfishness and establish public-mindedness, I must address this flaw and overcome liberalism. No matter what the matter is, whether it concerns members or cadres, I must dare to criticize and dare to uphold principles, engaging in ideological struggle. Last winter, a cadre in the brigade ordered members to go to a peanut field far from the village to pull peanuts, while he himself chose a field near the village to pull. At that time, I heard members complaining, "Even if we had four hands, we couldn't do as much as others!" I felt that the members' opinion was correct. That evening, at the meeting of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Association and the brigade committee, I brought up the members' opinions and criticized his actions as selfish. He humbly accepted the criticism and apologized to the members. I also frequently pointed out problems to some members who did shoddy work, picking the easy tasks and not caring about quality. The members all felt that this was very beneficial to the collective and were very satisfied, saying that I listened to Chairman Mao's words, changing from a "coward" to someone who "manages everything," and unanimously elected me as the deputy leader of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Association.

	I have only been studying Chairman Mao's works for a short time, and I have not studied or applied them enough. In the future, I will love Chairman Mao's works even more, remember Chairman Mao's words firmly, and become a person beneficial to the people.

### 读毛主席的书，做个革命化的农民

    读毛主席的书，做个革命化的农民
    大路排生产队社员　陈进福
    以前，我受旧社会剥削阶级坏思想的影响很深，眼光短浅，私心很重。一九六三年，队里派我上山到废矿场去挖矿搞副业。有一次，我找到矿苗后，把矿石挖出来埋在另一个地方，回生产队对干部说没有找到矿。到了春节假期，我上山把矿石挖出来偷偷卖了，把钱全部放入自己荷包。去年，队里搞社会主义教育运动，我开始认识到自己这样做不对，但是因为怕丢丑，不敢把这件事说出来。心里的疙瘩没解开，老是不安乐，吃不香，睡不甜。说好呢，不说好呢？思想里经常打架。就在这个时候，队里组织社员学习毛主席著作。有一晚，辅导员罗木星给我们讲解《纪念白求恩》这篇文章，我听完课，心里一直放不下。毛主席说的“毫不利己专门利人”八个字，好似一面镜子，照得我心里扑扑跳，翻来复去睡不着觉，思前想后地想起许多往事来。我在旧社会是个饮尽苦水的贫农。土改时，自己除了一个烂瓦煲，一顶烂“笠麻”（竹帽）之外，一无所有。全靠党的领导，我全家大小六口人，现在饥不愁，冷不忧，日子越过越好。我违反毛主席的指示，去干专门利己毫不利人的事，这怎能对得起共产党和毛主席呢？我越想越惭愧，决心向社员讲出自己的错误。起初，我妻子还想不开，我说：“坏思想一定要拿出去见阳光，偷偷改是改不了的。还是坚决听毛主席的话，知错就讲，讲了就改，早讲早好！”
    就这样，在一次社员大会上，我将瞒矿的事说了出来。当时，自己以为至少要受一次严厉批评。万万想不到，大家反而表扬我，说我听毛主席的话，敢向自己的私心“开火”；说我学习毛主席著作，在“用”字上下功夫下得好。这真使我感到心里又是难受又是甜，周身热辣辣的。心想，毛主席的领导真是英明伟大，革命的集体大家庭真是无限温暖呵！
    从此以后，我心胸开阔了，眼光望得远了。我下定决心，要更加努力读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，要彻底破私立公，做一个革命化的农民。去年冬天，我家猪舍屋盖的茅草，因为多年未换，霉烂了，下起雨来，两只猪周身湿淋淋，成天冷颤颤。我妻子几次叫我请假上山割茅草，重新搭个屋顶。当时正是队里犁霜田最紧张的时候。请假割茅草，就不能集中力量犁霜田；要犁霜田，就不能去割茅草。怎么办好呢？我想起毛主席的教导：一事当前不能先替自己打算！犁霜田是集体生产的大事，修猪舍再紧要也是件私人小事，我怎能先私后公，不顾集体利益呢？于是我就照毛主席的指示做，全心全意去犁霜田。
    过去，我还有一个很大的缺点，就是处处保护自己，时时怕人家讲自己坏话，所以，有的人损公利私，干活不顾质量，或者干部办事不公，自己明知眼见，也不讲不理，以免失了人情。那时，社员都说我是“胆小鬼”。学习了《反对自由主义》这篇文章之后，才知道“少管闲事”，怕失人情，就是十足的自私自利。毛主席说：“自由主义的来源，在于小资产阶级的自私自利性，以个人利益放在第一位，革命利益放在第二位”。毛主席的话，就好像针对我陈进福讲的，句句都打中我的心。我想，要彻底破私立公，就要针对自己这个缺点，克服自由主义。要做到不管对什么事情，不管是对社员还是对干部，都要敢于批评，敢于坚持原则，开展思想斗争。去年冬天，有个队的干部叫社员到离村较远的花生地去拔花生，他自己却找块近村边的地拔。当时我听到社员议论：“我们即使有四只手也做不过人家啦！”我觉得社员这个意见提得很对，当天晚上，在贫协和队委开会时，便把群众的意见说出来，批评他这种做法是自私自利。他虚心接受了批评，就向社员作了检讨。我对一些社员做工挑肥拣瘦，不顾质量等事情，也经常提意见，展开批评。社员都觉得这样对集体很有利，很满意，说我听毛主席的话，由“胆小鬼”变成“百事管”，还一致选我当贫协小组的副组长。
    我学习毛主席著作时间还很短，学得不够，用得更不够。今后，我要更加热爱毛主席的书，牢牢记住毛主席的话，做个有益于人民的人。
