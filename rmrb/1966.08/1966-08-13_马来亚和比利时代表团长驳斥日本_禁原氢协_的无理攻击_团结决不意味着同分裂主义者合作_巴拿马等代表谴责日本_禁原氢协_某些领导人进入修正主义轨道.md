Malayan and Belgian Delegation Leaders Refute Japan's "Ban the Bomb" Committee's Unreasonable Attacks
Unity Does Not Mean Cooperating with Splitters
Panamanian Representatives Condemn Certain Leaders of Japan's "Ban the Bomb" Committee for Entering the Revisionist Track

	Tokyo, August 12 (Xinhua) — Tokyo reports: To uphold the glorious tradition of the World Conference for the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, the Malayan delegation leader Lee Shaozu and the Belgian delegation leader Relekon jointly issued a written statement to the press on August 7, refuting the unreasonable attacks made by the Japan Council against Nuclear and Hydrogen Bombs (hereinafter referred to as the "Ban the Bomb" Council) on August 5 against foreign delegates who withdrew from the 12th World Conference for the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs.

	The statement by the Malayan and Belgian delegations pointed out that those who betrayed the spirit and tradition of the "Ban the Bomb" Council and the World Conference for the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs were not the foreign delegates who withdrew from the conference, but certain leaders of the "Ban the Bomb" Council.

	The statement pointed out that the 16 countries and regions that were forced to withdraw from the conference accounted for the majority of foreign delegates, but the "Ban the Bomb" Council's statement on August 5 attempted to cover up this fact. The statement said, "This majority includes many of the most representative delegations and many organizations that have given the strongest and most resolute support to the 'Ban the Bomb' Council and the World Conference for the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs in the past."

	The statement pointed out that from the beginning, the leaders of the "Ban the Bomb" Council refused to negotiate on the demand made by the vast majority of foreign delegates to expel the delegation of the World Federation of Democratic Youth from the conference, and forcibly included the delegation of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, which is controlled by the Soviet revisionist leadership, as a registered delegate in the World Conference. However, the "Ban the Bomb" Council's statement on August 5 distorted right and wrong, saying that foreign delegates attempted to impose their views on the "Ban the Bomb" Council.

	The statement said, "'The 'Ban the Bomb' Council's statement on August 5 attempts to exploit the respect that the people of Japan and other countries who love peace have for the great struggle tradition of the 'Ban the Bomb' Council and the World Conference for the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs. However, we believe that the people of Japan and other countries who love peace will not be deceived by it, and will see that it is the current leaders of the 'Ban the Bomb' Council who are determined to accept the splitters of the World Federation of Democratic Youth who are betraying this tradition and respect. 'Forcing the delegation of the World Federation of Democratic Youth into the conference is only part of the deliberate challenge that the leaders of the 'Ban the Bomb' Council have made to the true spirit and struggle tradition of the 'Ban the Bomb' Council and the World Conference.'"

	The statement said, "The World Federation of Democratic Youth, in collusion with the Soviet Peace Committee and the World Peace Council, following the orders of their common master, the Soviet revisionist leadership, persistently demands 'peace' and 'negotiations' for Vietnam, which is beneficial to the cause of American imperialism, and directly opposes the struggle of the Vietnamese people for victory. We have no hesitation in pointing out that it is we, the foreign delegates, who refuse to sit with the World Federation of Democratic Youth, which is in cahoots with them, and it is we, the foreign delegates, who represent the true spirit of the struggle of the Vietnamese people for victory at the conference."

	The statement pointed out, "Unity does not mean cooperating with splitters. One can only unite with friends and not with enemies in action. There are many true friends of the peace forces in various strata of people and various different political and social classes. There is a vast expanse of land for the implementation of broad and solid unity, without falling into the pit of unprincipled unity with false friends and swindlers."

	Tokyo, August 12 (Xinhua) — Tokyo reports: Panamanian and Malayan representatives, who were forced to withdraw from the 12th World Conference for the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs for adhering to the correct line, separately spoke to Chinese reporters in Tokyo, condemning certain leaders of the Japan Council against Nuclear and Hydrogen Bombs (hereinafter referred to as the "Ban the Bomb" Council) for betraying the glorious tradition of the World Conference for the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs in opposing imperialism and revisionism, and attempting to impose the erroneous line of "united action" without distinguishing between friends and enemies on the World Conference.

	Panamanian representative Franco said that the 12th World Conference for the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs exposed the betrayal of the glorious tradition of previous conferences by certain leaders of the Japanese "Ban the Bomb" Council, who made a major turn and entered the revisionist track. They are implementing a modern revisionist policy that is "against the people and against the revolution."

	Malayan delegation leader Lee Shaozu said that some leaders of this conference lacked the spirit of democratic consultation and the willingness to achieve consensus on the basis of the struggle against imperialism led by the United States. These leaders talk about "united action" on the Vietnam issue. However, on what basis to carry out "united action"? Against whom? In alliance with whom? They are all vague about these questions. They are imposing an erroneous line of "united action" without distinguishing between friends and enemies on foreign representatives.

	He also said that in this conference's "general report," it was conspicuously avoided whether to support China's third nuclear test. This is different from the attitude adopted by the "Ban the Bomb" Council in the past. Last year, the Japanese "Ban the Bomb" Council explicitly stated that China's possession of nuclear weapons was to strengthen the powerful force to safeguard world peace and oppose imperialist aggression; this year, however, it avoided clearly stating its position.

	According to Karachi reports: Basutoland representative Lehato Masobi, who attended the 12th World Conference for the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, said in Karachi on his way back from Tokyo on August 7 that the "general report" made by the Japanese "Ban the Bomb" Council at the Tokyo conference talked a lot about so-called "united action," but it did not clearly state with whom the people's anti-imperialist movement should unite and with whom to draw a clear line. This "united action" is actually to unite with those who play a destructive and paralyzing role in the anti-imperialist struggle—modern revisionists.

　　马来亚和比利时代表团长驳斥日本“禁原氢协”的无理攻击
　　团结决不意味着同分裂主义者合作
    巴拿马等代表谴责日本“禁原氢协”某些领导人进入修正主义轨道
    新华社十二日讯　东京消息：为维护禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的光荣传统而被迫退出第十二届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的马来亚代表团团长李绍祖和比利时代表团团长雷勒孔，八月七日上午在东京联名向新闻界发表书面声明，驳斥了日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会（简称“禁原氢协”）五日发表的无理攻击退出世界大会的外国代表的声明。
    马来亚代表团和比利时代表团的声明严正指出，背叛“禁原氢协”和禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的精神和传统的，不是退出大会的外国代表，而是“禁原氢协”的某些领导人。
    声明指出，被迫退出大会的有十六个国家和地区的外国代表，占外国代表的大多数，而“禁原氢协”五日声明却企图掩饰这个事实。声明说，“这个多数包括许多最有代表性的代表团，和许多在过去曾经给予‘禁原氢协’和禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会以最强有力的坚决的支持的组织。”
    声明指出，从一开始，“禁原氢协”领导人就拒绝就绝大多数外国代表提出的关于把世界民主青年联盟代表团驱逐出大会的要求进行协商，硬把苏联修正主义领导集团控制的世界民主青年联盟代表团作为已经登记的代表塞进世界大会，而“禁原氢协”五日声明却颠倒是非说，外国代表企图把自己意见强加于“禁原氢协”。
    声明说，“‘禁原氢协’五日声明，力图利用日本和其他国家爱好和平的人民过去对‘禁原氢协’和禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会伟大斗争传统的尊敬。但是我们相信，日本人民和其他国家爱好和平的人民不会受它欺骗，并将看到：背叛这一传统和尊敬的正是决心接受分裂主义的世界民主青年联盟的‘禁原氢协’现领导人。”“把世界民主青年联盟代表团塞进大会，只不过是‘禁原氢协’领导人对‘禁原氢协’和世界大会的真正精神和斗争传统蓄意提出的挑战的一部分。”
    声明说：“世界民主青年联盟同苏联保卫和平委员会和世界和平理事会密切勾结，奉了他们的共同主子苏联修正主义领导人的命令，一味要求越南‘和平’和‘谈判’，从而有利于美帝国主义的事业，而直接反对越南人民争取胜利的斗争。我们毫不犹豫地指出，正是我们外国代表们，拒绝同那个狼狈为奸的世界民主青年联盟坐在一起，正是我们外国代表们在会议上代表越南人民争取胜利的真正的精神。”
    声明指出：“团结并不意味着同分裂主义者合作。只能同朋友而不能同敌人统一行动。和平力量在各界人民和各个不同的政治和社会阶层中有许多真正的朋友。有广阔的天地来实行广泛的巩固的团结，而不堕入同虚假的朋友和骗子无原则的联合的泥坑。”
    据新华社十二日讯　东京消息：为坚持正确路线被迫退出第十二届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的巴拿马、马来亚代表在东京分别对中国记者发表谈话，谴责日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会（简称“禁原氢协”）的某些领导人背叛禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会反对帝国主义反对修正主义的光荣传统，企图把不分敌友的“统一行动”的错误路线强加给世界大会。
    巴拿马代表弗朗哥说，第十二届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会揭露了日本“禁原氢协”的某些领导人违背历届世界大会的光荣传统，来了一个大转变，进入修正主义的轨道。他们执行的是“反对人民、反对革命的现代修正主义政策。”
    马来亚代表团团长李绍祖说，本届大会的一些领导人没有民主协商的精神，缺乏在反对以美国为首的帝国主义的斗争的基础上取得一致的意愿。这些领导人谈论什么在越南问题上的“统一行动”。但是，在什么基础上搞“统一行动”呢？反对什么人呢？联合什么人呢？对这些，他们都含糊其词。他们是在把一条不分敌友的“统一行动”的错误路线强加给外国代表。
    他又说，在这次大会的“总报告”中，很显眼地避开是否支持中国进行第三次核试验的问题。这是同“禁原氢协”过去采取的态度有所不同的。去年日本“禁原氢协”肯定地表明，中国拥有核武器是为了壮大保障世界和平、反对帝国主义侵略的强大力量；今年却避免明确表示态度。
    另据卡拉奇消息：出席第十二届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的巴苏陀兰代表列哈托·马索比在从东京回国途中，七日在卡拉奇对新华社记者发表谈话说，日本“禁原氢协”在东京大会上所作的“总报告”，大谈所谓的“统一行动”，但是，却没有说清楚人民的反帝运动应当同谁联合，应当同那些人划清界限问题。这种“统一行动”，实际上是要同在反帝斗争中起破坏和瘫痪作用的分子——现代修正主义者实行联合。
