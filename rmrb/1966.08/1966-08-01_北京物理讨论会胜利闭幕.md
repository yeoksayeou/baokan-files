The Beijing Physics Discussion Conference of the 1966 Summer Science Conference concluded successfully today. Over 10,000 people from various sectors in the capital, along with more than 140 scientists from over 30 countries across four continents, gathered to celebrate the significant contributions made by the conference to the unity of scientists and peoples from the four continents in opposing imperialism and developing national scientific and cultural endeavors.

Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and President of the Chinese Association for Science and Technology Li Siguang, and other leaders from various sectors in China, as well as many foreign friends in Beijing, attended the closing ceremony.

During the nine-day conference, scientists from the four continents worked diligently. At the closing ceremony, they were warmly welcomed by the people of the Chinese capital. As the conference chairpersons and Chinese leaders, including Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen, ascended the stage, the orchestra played a welcoming tune, and the entire audience stood and applauded for a long time. Children ran onto the stage to present flowers to the scientists from various countries.

The solemn closing ceremony was held at the Great Hall of the People. The venue was decorated in a solemn and simple manner. The conference emblem was prominently displayed in the center of the stage, flanked by ten red flags. Fresh flowers and evergreen trees were arranged on the stage. A large banner in the center of the hall read: "Long live the great unity of scientists from Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania!" "Long live the great unity of all peoples of the world!"

At today's closing ceremony, the conference chairman, Japanese scientist representative team leader Noshima Morikichi, read the conference report. Scientists from 30 countries took turns speaking to congratulate the successful conclusion of the conference. Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, spoke on behalf of the Chinese people and Chinese scientists.

The conference report read at the meeting stated that this conference enhanced the unity and friendship of scientists from the four continents and played an important role in promoting new developments in physics. It once again demonstrated that the awakened peoples and scientists of the four continents have the resolve, talent, and confidence to master the most advanced science and technology. The report reaffirmed that only by first opposing imperialism and old and new colonialism can the scientific and cultural endeavors of the peoples and nations of the four continents develop. The report also called on scientists from the four continents to strive for further strengthening their unity, friendship, and academic exchanges, and to contribute to the convening of the 1968 Beijing Science Conference.

The scientists from various countries who spoke at the meeting used the most beautiful language to congratulate the achievements of this conference, expressing the determination and confidence of scientists and peoples from the four continents to oppose imperialism and colonialism and to develop national scientific and cultural endeavors. In their speeches, the scientists once again enthusiastically praised the great thoughts of Mao Zedong and the great achievements of the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought in various fields. The scientists also condemned in their speeches the heinous crimes of American imperialism in expanding the Vietnam War and using scientific achievements to massacre the Vietnamese people, expressing their resolute support for the just struggle of the heroic Vietnamese people to resist American aggression and save their country.

The scientists from various countries who consecutively spoke at the meeting were: Wei Ruqun from Vietnam, Grunbone from Uruguay, Osman from the United Arab Republic, Mulani from Uganda, Zimaili from Tunisia, Ntamila from Tanzania, Azam from Syria, Hegazi from Sudan, Jalou from Sierra Leone, Sakkar from Pakistan, Onianwa from Nigeria, Pradan from Nepal, Wazani from Morocco, Anna Maria Seto from Mexico, Noshima Morikichi from Japan, Jita from Iraq, Suhariyo from Indonesia, Saidou from Guinea, Romero from Ecuador, Emmanuel from Congo (Brazzaville), Gamba from Colombia, Alvial from Chile, Kannangara from Ceylon, Jichun from Cambodia, Wu Jiaomin from Burma, Roberts from Australia, a scientist from Argentina, Yusuf from Algeria, Gaisi from the East African Academy of Sciences, and Ebadi from Afghanistan.

Guo Moruo pointed out in his speech that the convening of this conference and its achievements once again shattered the so-called Western superiority theory and proved that the claim that Europe and North America are the centers of world civilization is outdated. The conference has profound significance for the progress of physics and the entire natural sciences in the four continents and has enhanced the unity and friendship of scientists from the four continents in their common struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism. This conference, along with the recent Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers held in Beijing, once again shows that the concept of Asian-African unity has not only not been eliminated but has been further strengthened and expanded, and the concept of Asian-African unity has developed into the concept of unity of the four continents. Guo Moruo pointed out that the historical trend of the peoples of the four continents taking their destiny into their own hands and becoming masters, not slaves, is irresistible.

Guo Moruo emphasized that Mao Zedong Thought is Marxism-Leninism in the era of the comprehensive collapse of imperialism and the global victory of socialism. Without Mao Zedong Thought as our guiding ideology, there would be no New China and no great achievements in socialist construction over the past 17 years. Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution unfolding across the country is a revolutionary movement unprecedented in history, where 700 million people are studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticizing old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits, and creating new socialist ideas, culture, customs, and habits. A new era has begun where the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers directly grasp Mao Zedong Thought, which will ultimately end the history of a few people monopolizing science and culture in our country and truly liberate the creative potential of hundreds of millions of laboring people. The impact of this on the development of science and culture in our country is immeasurable. Guo Moruo said that foreign friends enthusiastically praised Mao Zedong Thought at this conference, which is a great encouragement to us. Chinese scientists must always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, advance along the path of being both red and expert as indicated by Chairman Mao, and wholeheartedly serve the people of the whole country and the people of the whole world.

Guo Moruo once again expressed in his speech that Chinese scientists, like all the people of China, firmly support Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to the Entire Nation" and firmly endorse Chairman Liu Shaoqi's statement, and are ready at any time to respond to the call of the motherland to contribute everything to fight alongside the Vietnamese people against the American aggressors.

Guo Moruo finally said, "We, the peoples and scientists of the four continents, will, with our own hands, continue to achieve more and greater successes in science and technology, make greater contributions to burying imperialism, old and new colonialism, and their lackeys, and strive for and defend national independence, safeguard world peace, and develop the national economy, culture, and scientific endeavors of the four continents."

When the conference report was read and when the scientists from various countries consecutively spoke and Guo Moruo delivered his speech, the audience repeatedly erupted in prolonged, enthusiastic applause.

Foreign friends invited to attend today's closing ceremony included the General Secretary of the Asian-African Journalists' Association, Chahardo, Japanese peace activist Nishizono Koji, the famous American black leader Robert F. Williams, the President of the Lao Women's Union, Kuenin Bounsena, the representative of the Thai Patriotic Front abroad, Paron Chularat, and the Director of the Beijing Office of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Galib, among others.

Leaders from various sectors in China, including Liao Chengzhi, Zhang Ziqing, Han Guang, Chu Tunan, Ji Pengfei, Xiao Wangdong, Hao Deqing, Hu Yuzhi, He Wei, Wang Kunlun, Luo Shunzhi, Ma Pangu, Liu Qingyang, Wang Zhiwan, Chang Zhiqing, Shen Qizhen, Jin Shengbao, Qian Dawei, and Huang Bocheng, also attended today's closing ceremony.

When the executive chairman finally announced the successful conclusion of the conference, the orchestra played the "Anti-Imperialist March," and the entire audience stood and applauded for several minutes.

    在历时九天的会议期间付出了辛勤劳动的四大洲各国科学家，在闭幕式上受到我国首都各界人民的热情致意。当讨论会主席团成员同聂荣臻副总理等我国领导人一起登上主席台时，乐队奏迎宾曲，全场起立长时间地热烈鼓掌。少年儿童们跑上主席台，向各国科学家们献花。
    隆重的闭幕式在人民大会堂举行。会场布置庄严朴素。主席台正中高悬讨论会会徽，两旁插着十面红旗，台上摆着鲜花和常青树。会场中央悬挂着巨幅标语：“亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲、大洋洲各国科学家大团结万岁！”“全世界人民大团结万岁！”
    在今天的闭幕大会上，讨论会主席团会议召集人、日本科学家代表团团长野上茂吉郎宣读了这次讨论会的公报；有三十个国家的科学家相继登台致词祝贺讨论会圆满成功；郭沫若副委员长代表中国人民和中国科学工作者讲了话。
    大会上宣读的讨论会公报指出，这次讨论会增进了四大洲科学家的团结和友谊，对促进物理学的新发展具有重要意义，再次表明四大洲觉醒了的人民和科学家有志气、有才能、有信心掌握最先进的科学和技术。公报又一次确认，只有首先反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义，才能使四大洲各国民族的、人民大众的科学文化事业得以发展。公报还号召四大洲各国科学家们为进一步加强彼此间的团结友谊和学术交流而努力，并且为一九六八年北京科学讨论会的召开作出贡献。
    在大会上致词的各国科学家，用最美好的语言祝贺这次讨论会所取得的成就，表达了四大洲各国科学家和人民反帝反殖和发展民族科学文化事业的决心和信心。科学家们在致词中又一次热情赞颂伟大的毛泽东思想，赞颂用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民在各方面取得的巨大成就。科学家们还在致词中谴责美帝国主义扩大侵越战争和滥用科学成果屠杀越南人民的滔天罪行，表达了他们对英雄的越南人民抗美救国正义斗争的坚决支持。
    相继在大会上致词的各国科学家是：越南的魏如昆嵩，乌拉圭的格龙波内，阿联的奥斯曼，乌干达的穆拉尼，突尼斯的兹迈利，坦桑尼亚的恩塔米拉，叙利亚的阿扎姆，苏丹的赫加齐，塞拉勒窝内的贾洛，巴基斯坦的萨卡尔，尼日利亚的奥尼安瓦，尼泊尔的普拉丹，摩洛哥的瓦扎尼，墨西哥的安娜·玛丽亚·塞托，日本的野上茂吉郎，伊拉克的吉塔，印度尼西亚的苏哈里约，几内亚的赛杜，厄瓜多尔的罗梅罗，刚果（布）的埃曼纽埃尔，哥伦比亚的甘巴，智利的阿尔维亚尔，锡兰的坎南加拉，柬埔寨的吉春，缅甸的吴叫敏，澳大利亚的罗伯茨，阿根廷的一位科学家，阿尔及利亚的优素福，东非科学院的盖希，阿富汗的埃巴迪。
    郭沫若在讲话中指出，这次讨论会的召开和取得的成就，再一次打破了所谓西方优越论，证明了所谓欧洲和北美是世界文明中心的说法早已过时。讨论会对于四大洲各国物理学和整个自然科学的进展具有深远的促进意义，并且增进了四大洲各国科学家在共同反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义基础上的团结和友谊。这次讨论会连同前不久在北京召开的亚非作家紧急会议，再一次表明亚非团结的概念不仅没有消灭，而且更加巩固和扩大，亚非团结的概念已经发展为四大洲团结的概念了。郭沫若指出，四大洲各国人民要掌握自己的命运，要做主人，不愿做奴隶，这个历史发展的潮流是势不可当的。
    郭沫若强调说，毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃、社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。没有毛泽东思想作为我们的指导方向，就没有新中国，就没有十七年来社会主义建设的伟大成就。当前，在全国范围内展开的社会主义文化大革命，正是七亿人民活学活用毛泽东思想，彻底批判旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，从而创造社会主义的新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯的，史无前例的革命运动。一个工农兵群众直接掌握毛泽东思想的新时代开始了，它将在我国最终结束少数人垄断科学文化的历史，真正地把亿万劳动人民的创造潜力解放出来。这对我国科学文化的发展，其影响之大是不可估量的。郭沫若说，外国朋友们在这次讨论会上热情洋溢地歌颂了毛泽东思想，这对我们是很大的鼓励。中国科学工作者一定要永远高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，沿着毛泽东主席所指出的又红又专的道路不断前进，全心全意地为全中国人民和全世界人民服务到底。
    郭沫若在讲话中再一次表示，中国科学工作者和全中国人民一样，最坚决地支持胡志明主席的《告全国同胞书》，最坚决地拥护刘少奇主席的声明，随时准备响应祖国召唤，为同越南人民一起打击美国侵略者而贡献自己的一切。
    郭沫若最后说，我们四大洲的人民和科学工作者，将用自己的双手，不断地在科学技术上取得更多更大的成就，为埋葬帝国主义、新老殖民主义及其走狗作出更大的贡献，为争取和维护民族独立，保卫世界和平，发展四大洲的民族经济、文化和科学事业作出更大的贡献。
    当宣读讨论会公报的时候，当各国科学家相继致词和郭沫若讲话的时候，会场上一再响起长时间的热烈掌声。
    应邀出席今天闭幕式的外国朋友，有亚非记协总书记查禾多，日本和平人士西园寺公一，著名的美国黑人领袖罗伯特·威廉，老挝妇女联合会主席贵宁·奔舍那夫人，泰国爱国阵线驻国外代表帕荣·朱拉暖，巴勒斯坦解放组织驻北京办事处主任加尔布等。
    我国各方面的负责人廖承志、张奚若、韩光、楚图南、姬鹏飞、萧望东、郝德青、胡愈之、何伟、王昆仑、罗舜初、马纯古、刘清扬、王植范、常芝青、沈其震、金善宝、钱大卫、黄伯诚等，也出席了今天的闭幕式。
    当大会执行主席最后宣布讨论会胜利闭幕时，乐队高奏《反帝大军进行曲》，全场起立鼓掌达数分钟之久。
