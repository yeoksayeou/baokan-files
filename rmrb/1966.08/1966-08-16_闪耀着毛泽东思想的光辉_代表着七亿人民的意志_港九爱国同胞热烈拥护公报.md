Hong Kong and Kowloon patriots enthusiastically welcomed and endorsed the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. They pointed out that the communiqué shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought and represents the will of 700 million Chinese people. The issuance of the communiqué is a great joy for all the people of China and the world.

The "Wen Wei Po" and "Ta Kung Pao" in Hong Kong both published extras for the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China yesterday. These extras were quickly snapped up. By nightfall, many people were excitedly discussing this good news in the streets and public places.

Chairman Chen Yaocai and Director Yang Guang of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions said that the communiqué is the action program representing the will of the working class and the people of the whole country. The great leader Chairman Mao personally presided over this meeting, which will certainly lead the people of our country from victory to greater victories.

When the news reached the Hong Kong Seamen's Union, the seamen were holding a meeting. The chairman of the union immediately reported the contents of the communiqué to those present, and the meeting immediately became lively. The seamen expressed their enthusiastic response to the great call of the communiqué, resolutely supporting the Vietnamese people's just struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, refusing to transport goods for American imperialism to invade Vietnam, and taking practical actions to strike at the aggressors.

Yesterday, various circles in Hong Kong and Kowloon, including industry and commerce, news, education, film, and women, all expressed their enthusiastic support for the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
