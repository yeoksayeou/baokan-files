	When we heard the announcement of the Party's Eighth Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, our hearts immediately surged with excitement, and the entire venue erupted in cheers that lasted for a long time. "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand times ten thousand!" "Long live Mao Zedong Thought, ten thousand times ten thousand!" We shouted these slogans thousands and tens of thousands of times, and sang "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" thousands and tens of thousands of times, yet it still felt insufficient to express our revolutionary soldiers' boundless love, faith, and admiration for our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao. Over the past few days, the Party Central Committee decided to publish a large number of copies of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong"; the Party Central Committee issued a decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; Chairman Mao received revolutionary masses from the capital and issued a great call to battle. One piece of good news after another, one piece of joyous news after another. We gathered from all over the country to Chairman Mao's side, and over the past few days, we have been immersed in happiness, with our hearts filled with the passion for battle. Today, after hearing the announcement of the Eighth Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, our surging emotions reached a new peak once again.

	The series of major decisions made by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao are absolutely correct and brilliant. These decisions guide the victorious development of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. Currently, the domestic and international situation is excellent, greatly boosting the fighting spirit of revolutionary soldiers. The announcement mentions that our People's Liberation Army, over the past few years, under the leadership of the Military Commission and Vice Chairman Lin Biao, has insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the written word, promoting the revolutionization of thought, and becoming a model for the entire nation to learn from. This is a great encouragement and motivation for us. We feel that the responsibility entrusted to us by the Party and the people of our motherland is even greater. In the current situation where the entire nation responds to Chairman Mao's call to learn from the People's Liberation Army, we must launch a more solid and in-depth campaign to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, accelerate the revolutionization of thought, and respond to the expectations of the Party and the people of the entire nation. We deeply understand that Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline, the red sun in our hearts, the guiding principle for all work in the nation, the Party, and the army, and the most reliable and fundamental guarantee for successfully carrying out the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the smartest, bravest, and most combat-effective. We will read Chairman Mao's books all the time, in everything, every day, every year, reading them a thousand times, ten thousand times, and passing them down from generation to generation; we will listen to every word of Chairman Mao, listening for a hundred years, a thousand years, ten thousand years, and passing it down from generation to generation; we will follow every instruction of Chairman Mao, following them this year, next year, every year, forever, and passing them down to future generations. We will rise up with a thousand-pound hammer to smash the anti-Party clique that opposes Mao Zedong Thought and slanders us workers, peasants, and soldiers studying Chairman Mao's works, turning these demons and monsters into smithereens! We will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, ensuring that our ironclad socialist state will never change color.

	Currently, American imperialism is frantically expanding its aggression in Vietnam, pointing its aggressive spearhead at our country. We revolutionary soldiers resolutely respond to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, heightening our vigilance a hundredfold, firmly guarding our battle positions, and preparing for all battle tasks. If it dares to take risks and impose war on our people, we will resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate it! To defend our socialist motherland, liberate our sacred territory of Taiwan, support the people of Vietnam, and support the world revolution, we are ready at any time to carry out all battle tasks assigned to us by the Party Central Committee.

	Long live the invincible great Mao Zedong Thought!

	Long live our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand!

　　毛主席的指示件件照办永远照办最敬爱的党中央最敬爱的毛主席：
    当我们在广播里听到党的八届十一中全会公报的时候，我们的心立刻沸腾起来，全场欢声雷动，经久不息。“毛主席万岁，万万岁！”“毛泽东思想万岁，万万岁！”口号连着喊千遍、万遍，《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》唱千遍万遍，也觉得表达不出我们革命战士对最敬爱的领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜的心情。几天来，党中央决定大量出版《毛泽东选集》；党中央发布关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定；毛主席接见首都革命群众，发出了伟大的战斗号召，一个捷报连着一个捷报，一个喜讯接着一个喜讯。我们从祖国四面八方聚集到毛主席身边，几天来一直沉浸在幸福之中，内心充满了战斗的激情。今天听了八届十一中全会的公报，再一次把我们澎湃的心潮推向一个新的高峰。
    党中央和毛主席所做的一系列重大的决策，是万分正确、万分英明的。这些决策指导着中国革命和世界革命的胜利发展。当前，国内外一片大好形势，极大地鼓舞了我们革命战士的斗志。公报中说，我们人民解放军，几年来，在军委和林彪副主席的领导下，坚持活学活用毛主席著作，在用字上狠下功夫，促进思想革命化，成为全国人民学习的榜样。这对我们是个极大的鼓舞和鞭策。我们感到党和祖国人民交给我们的担子更重了。在当前全国人民响应毛主席的号召，大学解放军的形势下，我们一定要掀起一个更扎实、更深入的活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，加速思想革命化，来回答党和全国人民的期望。我们深深体会到：毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，是我们心中的红太阳，是我们全国、全党、全军一切工作的指导方针，是胜利地进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设最可靠、最根本的保证。用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士，最聪明、最勇敢、最有战斗力。毛主席的书，我们时时读，事事读，天天读，年年读，读一千遍、一万遍，世世代代读；毛主席的话句句要听，听一百年、一千年、一万年，世世代代都要听；毛主席的指示，件件照办，今年照办，明年照办，年年照办，永远照办，子孙万代照办。反党黑帮反对毛泽东思想，诬蔑我们工农兵学习毛主席著作，我们要奋起千钧棒，把这些牛鬼蛇神砸个稀巴烂！把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，保证我们铁打的社会主义江山永不变色。
    当前，美帝国主义疯狂地扩大侵略越南的战争，把侵略矛头指向我国。我们革命战士坚决响应党中央和毛主席的号召，百倍提高警惕，严守战斗岗位，作好一切战斗准备，如果它胆敢冒险，把战争强加到我国人民头上，我们就坚决、彻底、干净、全部地消灭它！为保卫社会主义祖国，解放我国神圣领土台湾，支援越南人民，支援世界革命，随时准备执行党中央交给我们的一切战斗任务。
    战无不胜的伟大的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
