We focus on forestry, while also engaging in agriculture and sideline businesses. Additionally, we have established a half-work, half-study school. This approach enables us to cultivate new individuals with communist consciousness.

Our forest farm was established in early 1964 in response to Chairman Mao's call for the entire nation to learn from the People's Liberation Army. We focus on forestry, while also engaging in agriculture and sideline businesses. Additionally, we have established a half-work, half-study school to cultivate red and expert junior forestry technicians for the people's communes. In this school, we take the People's Liberation Army as our model, implementing military-style organization, with a focus on study, and combining political and military education, criticizing the bourgeoisie, and engaging in mass work.

The emergence of a new thing always involves struggle. During the establishment of our forest farm, some people poured cold water on us, saying, "Your unit is neither fish nor fowl; it's not a forest farm, not a school, not an army, it's a 'three-not-like.'" Others said, "It's neither work nor agriculture, neither soldier nor student," it's a 'four-not-like.' Those who say we are 'three-not-like' or 'four-not-like' always view new things with bourgeois-colored glasses.

Facts have proven that such forest farms and schools can cultivate new individuals with communist consciousness. In our farm's Fifth Company, there are over 140 students, all of whom are urban youth. Before entering the farm, they had weak work ethics, were undisciplined, and did not care about politics. Since entering the farm, under the guidance of the party branch and the influence of senior comrades, they have studied Chairman Mao's works and learned the Three-Eight work style of the People's Liberation Army. In less than a year, their work ethic and organizational discipline have improved, and they have also learned basic forestry and agricultural production skills.

We will not let down the party and Chairman Mao's teachings. We will strive to study Chairman Mao's works more diligently, learn from the People's Liberation Army, take Chairman Mao's recent great instructions as our action guidelines, and run this new-type forest farm even better.

    新型的林场　新型的人
    我们以林业为主，兼搞农业和副业，还办了一个半工半读的学校。这样做，能够培养出有共产主义觉悟的新人。
    广西壮族自治区示范林场党委书记　覃鸿洲
    我们这个林场，是响应毛主席发出全国都要学习解放军的伟大号召，在一九六四年初创办起来的。我们以林业为主，兼搞农业和副业，还办了一个半工半读的学校，为人民公社培养又红又专的基层林业技术人材。在这个学校里，我们以解放军为榜样，实行组织军事化，以学为主，兼学政治、军事，批判资产阶级，从事群众工作。
    一个新事物的出现，总是要经过斗争的。我们林场在开办过程中，有些人曾经大泼冷水，说：“你们这个单位不伦不类，林场不象林场，学校不象学校，部队不象部队，是个‘三不象’。”也有的说：“工不工、农不农、兵不兵、学生不象个学生”，是个“四不象”。那些说我们“三不象”、“四不象”的人，总是带着资产阶级的有色眼镜看待新事物。
    事实证明，象这样的林场和学校，能够培养出有共产主义觉悟的新人。我场五连一百四十多个学员，全是街道知识青年。他们入场前，劳动观念差，生活散漫，不关心政治。入场以来，在党支部的教育下，在老同志带动下，学习毛主席著作，学习解放军的三八作风，不到一年，他们的劳动观念、组织纪律性都加强了，还学会了林、农生产基本技能。
    我们绝不辜负党和毛主席的教导，要更努力学习毛主席著作，学习解放军，把毛主席最近的伟大指示作为行动纲领，把这个新型林场办得更好。
