The entire PLA enthusiastically celebrates Chairman Mao's latest instructions and ensures the establishment of a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

On August 1, the New China News Agency reported that along the country's thousand-mile coastal defense line, on the Tibetan Plateau, at air force bases and naval docks, and in vast military camps, the PLA's officers and soldiers, filled with passion, held various activities to celebrate the 39th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army. The officers and soldiers enthusiastically discussed the great achievements made by the army in the path of proletarianization, revolutionization, and combat readiness under the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought. They celebrated the great victories of the Cultural Revolution and unanimously declared that they would hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao's instructions, and uphold and carry forward the glorious tradition of the PLA being a combat force, a work force, and a production force. They would make new and greater contributions to turning the PLA into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

This morning, after many units' officers and soldiers heard the broadcast of the People's Daily's editorial "The Whole Country Should Become a Great School of Mao Zedong Thought" and the Liberation Army Daily's editorial "Turn the Army into a Great School of Mao Zedong Thought" on the radio, they were overjoyed and spread the news to each other. They said: This is Chairman Mao's instruction, the voice of Chairman Mao! They held discussions and unanimously agreed that Chairman Mao instructed us that the People's Liberation Army should be a great school, where we should learn politics, military affairs, culture, participate in agricultural and sideline production, establish small and medium-sized factories, engage in mass work, and at any time participate in the cultural revolutionary struggle against the bourgeoisie. Chairman Mao's extremely important instructions are the latest summary of the army's decades of experience and a new development of Marxism-Leninism with epoch-making significance and strategic importance. Navy comrade Fan Binlan, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, happily said after listening to the broadcast, "Chairman Mao's latest instructions guarantee that our army will always advance on the path of proletarianization, revolutionization, and combat readiness. I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions and, in this great school, study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, and train myself to be a red successor to the cause of the proletarian revolution."

Various units' celebrations of "August 1st" began enthusiastically before the festival. Slogans such as "Learn from Comrade Liu Yingjun," "Study, apply, and propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and defend Mao Zedong Thought," "Inherit and carry forward the glorious traditions of the army, and turn the army into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought" were posted all over the camps and frontline positions.

The soldiers sang revolutionary songs such as "The East Is Red," "I Am a Soldier," and "Carry the Cultural Revolution to the End." Various units held the study of Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the central content of their festival activities. Some held report meetings, some held discussion meetings, and some also extensively carried out cultural propaganda activities. The leadership organs of the Tibet, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia military regions held grand celebration meetings before the festival. The Chengdu troops also held a grand revolutionary song singing festival. The officers and soldiers of a certain radar station in the Air Force specially studied Chairman Mao's statements on the people's army, reviewed Chairman Mao's instructions that the army is always a combat force, a work force, and a production force, and said, "Over the past 39 years, our army has followed Chairman Mao's teachings, developed the glorious tradition of fighting while producing and doing mass work, and thus been able to overcome various difficulties on the road ahead and achieve revolutionary victories. Our radar station is stationed on a small island far from the mainland, and it is precisely because we have implemented Chairman Mao's instructions that we have relatively well completed our tasks and, at the same time, tempered our thoughts and cultivated a spirit of hard struggle in production. In the current new situation, we must remember Chairman Mao's instructions more firmly and resolutely turn the army into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought." The officers and soldiers of the "Good Fifth Company in Front of Tiananmen" in a certain unit of the Beijing troops held a celebration meeting. At the meeting, political instructor Peng Yuanhao told everyone about the glorious history of the army, and the soldiers spoke one after another, unanimously declaring that the People's Liberation Army is the people's army created and led by Chairman Mao. They must study and apply Chairman Mao's works more actively in this great school and make it even better. Many companies of the Guangzhou and Kunming troops studied Chairman Mao's new instructions while organizing propaganda teams, carrying Mao's quotations, and extensively carrying out propaganda activities in rural areas, factories, and schools. The West Alliance garrison of the Kunming troops took Mao's new instructions as a new battle call, propagated them to the local Wa and Lahu ethnic groups, and the masses were greatly inspired. They decided to resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, study politics, military affairs, and culture, criticize the bourgeoisie, and turn the Awa Mountains into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

During the celebration of the Army Day, many companies and officers and soldiers seriously reviewed the progress made in the past year under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought and further launched a new high tide of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The leadership organs of the Shenyang troops' cadres, workers, and family members visited the Liaoning Province exhibition of studying Chairman Mao's works in the morning of the festival. The "Red Ninth Company," a model company in the entire army for studying Chairman Mao's works, held a meeting to learn from Liu Yingjun on the festival day. The officers and soldiers unanimously declared that they would study and apply Chairman Mao's works like Liu Yingjun, change their worldview bit by bit, firmly establish the thought of serving the people, deeply plant the roots of proletarian thought, and always be propagandists and fighters defending Mao Zedong Thought. The officers and soldiers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force in Shanghai held extensive experience exchange meetings and discussion meetings on studying Chairman Mao's works. They said that countless ironclad facts prove that those armed with Mao Zedong Thought have the strongest fighting power; Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for the PLA to defeat the enemy and advance on the path of extremely proletarianization and extremely combat readiness. In the army, those who have occupied important positions of the bourgeoisie representatives oppose the PLA's active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, oppose emphasizing politics, and attempt to turn the PLA into a bourgeois army that is detached from Mao Zedong Thought, proletarian politics, the masses, and productive labor, serving a few ambitious people. We must resolutely and thoroughly smash their plots and, at any time and under any circumstances, not deviate from Chairman Mao's military thought and military line.

During the celebration of the Army Day, the broad officers and soldiers firmly declared: We are soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, we will shoulder the burden of world revolution! Currently, American imperialism is expanding its aggression in Vietnam and attempting to bring the war to our territory. We must be a hundred times more vigilant, strengthen our readiness, and be prepared to strike any invading enemy at any time. Many officers and soldiers stationed on the southwestern border of the motherland said, "Chairman Liu Shaoqi's solemn declaration represents the will of 700 million Chinese people, and the People's Liberation Army firmly supports it. We have already made full preparations and are ready to fight side by side with the Vietnamese people as soon as the motherland gives the order, and thoroughly annihilate the American aggressors." The officers and soldiers on the front line of Fujian specially studied Chairman Mao's statements on class, class struggle, and the fact that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers during the festival. The officers and soldiers declared that the aggressive nature of imperialism and reactionaries will never change, and we must firmly remember the teachings of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, not only be vigilant against open enemies with guns but also be vigilant against hidden enemies without guns. If they dare to stir up trouble, we will resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and cleanly annihilate them!

    全军指战员热烈欢呼毛主席最新指示
    保证把毛泽东思想的大学校办得更好
    新华社一日讯　在祖国千里海防线上，在西藏高原，在空军机场、海军码头，在广大营区，人民解放军各部队指战员，满怀激情，举行多种多样活动，欢庆中国人民解放军建军三十九周年。指战员们畅谈在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，我军在无产阶级化、革命化、战斗化道路上突飞猛进的巨大成就，欢呼我国无产阶级文化大革命所取得的伟大胜利，一致表示，要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，遵循毛主席的指示，保持和发扬我军“既是战斗队，又是工作队，又是生产队”的光荣传统，为把我军办成毛泽东思想的大学校，作出新的更大的贡献。
    今天早晨，许多部队指战员从广播喇叭里听到播送的《人民日报》为纪念中国人民解放军建军三十九周年而发表的社论《全国都应该成为毛泽东思想的大学校》和《解放军报》社论《把我军办成毛泽东思想的大学校》以后，个个喜形于色，奔走相告。他们说：这是毛主席的指示，毛主席的声音！纷纷举行座谈讨论，一致认为，毛主席指示我们，人民解放军应该是一个大学校，要学政治，学军事，学文化，参加农副业生产，办中小工厂，从事群众工作和随时参加批判资产阶级的文化革命斗争。毛主席的极其重要的指示，是对我军几十年经验的最新总结，是对马克思列宁主义划时代的新发展，具有伟大的历史意义和战略意义。海军某部学习毛主席著作积极分子范彬兰听了广播高兴地说，毛主席的这一最新的指示，保证我军永远在无产阶级化、革命化、战斗化的道路上迈进。我一定要坚决按照毛主席的指示办事，在这个大学校里，活学活用毛主席著作，把自己锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业的红色接班人。
    各部队欢庆“八一”的活动，早在节前就热烈展开了。“向刘英俊同志学习”、“学习毛泽东思想，贯彻毛泽东思想，宣传毛泽东思想，捍卫毛泽东思想”、“继承发扬我军光荣传统，把我军办成毛泽东思想的大学校”等标语，贴满了营区、前沿阵地。
    战士们唱着《东方红》、《我是一个兵》、《把文化大革命进行到底》等革命歌曲，开展庆祝活动。各部队都把学习毛主席最新的指示，作为庆祝节日活动的中心内容，有的举行报告会，有的举行讨论会，有的还广泛开展文艺宣传活动。西藏、新疆、内蒙古等军区领导机关，在节前都隆重举行了庆祝大会。成都部队还举行了盛大的革命歌曲演唱大会。空军某部“红色前哨雷达站”指战员，专门学习了毛主席关于人民军队的论述，重温了毛主席规定的我军永远是一个战斗队，同时又是一个工作队，一个生产队的指示，他们说，三十九年来，我军按照毛主席的教导，发扬了一面打仗，一面生产，还做群众工作的光荣传统，因而能够克服前进道路上的各种困难，取得了革命的胜利。我们雷达站驻守在远离大陆的小岛上，也正是因为执行了毛主席的这一指示，所以较好地完成了任务，同时又在参加生产中锻炼了思想，培养了艰苦奋斗的作风。在今天的新形势下，我们更要牢记毛主席的这一指示，坚决把我军建设成为毛泽东思想的大学校。北京部队某部“天安门前好五连”的指战员举行了庆祝会，在会上，教导员彭源涛给大家讲述了我军的光荣历史，战士们纷纷在会上发言，一致表示，人民解放军是毛主席亲手缔造和领导的人民军队。他们一定要在这所大学校里更好地活学活用毛主席著作，把它办得好上加好。广州、昆明等部队许多连队战士一边学习毛主席的新指示，一边组织宣传队，带着毛主席语录，深入农村、工厂、学校广泛开展宣传活动。昆明部队西盟驻军把毛主席的新指示当作新的战斗号召，向当地佤族、拉祜族群众宣传，群众受到极大鼓舞，决心坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，学政治，学军事，学文化，批判资产阶级，把阿佤山变成学习毛泽东思想的大学校。
    在欢庆建军节的日子里，许多连队和指战员，还认真回顾了一年来在毛泽东思想哺育下取得的进步，进一步掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。沈阳部队领导机关广大干部、职工和家属，在节日的上午，参观了辽宁省学习毛主席著作展览。全军学习毛主席著作的标兵“红九连”，在节日里举行了学习刘英俊的讲用会。干部战士一致表示要象刘英俊那样，活学活用毛主席著作，一点一滴地改造世界观，把为人民服务的思想树立得牢牢的，把无产阶级的思想根子扎得深深的，永远做毛泽东思想的宣传员，做捍卫毛泽东思想的战斗员。驻沪陆、海、空三军各部队指战员，普遍举行了学习毛主席著作的经验交流会和座谈会。他们说，无数铁的事实证明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，具有最强的战斗力；毛泽东思想是我军克敌制胜的根本，是我军在非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的道路上迈进的保证。在军队里窃踞了重要职位的资产阶级代表人物，反对我军活学活用毛主席著作，反对突出政治，妄图把我军变成一支脱离毛泽东思想，脱离无产阶级政治，脱离人民群众，脱离生产劳动，为少数野心家服务的资产阶级军队。我们必须坚决彻底地粉碎他们的阴谋，在任何时候，在任何情况下，都不可离开毛主席的建军思想和建军路线的轨道。
    在欢庆建军节的时候，广大指战员坚定地表示：我们是毛泽东思想武装的战士，我们要挑起世界革命的重担！目前，美帝国主义正在越南扩大侵略战争，企图把战火烧到我国领土。我们一定要百倍提高警惕，加强战备，随时准备打击一切来犯的敌人。驻守在祖国西南边境的许多部队指战员说，刘少奇主席的庄严声明，代表了七亿中国人民的意志，中国人民解放军坚决拥护。我们已经作好了充分准备，只等祖国一声令下，立即和越南人民一起并肩战斗，彻底消灭美国侵略者。福建前线部队指战员，在节日里专门学习了毛主席关于阶级、阶级斗争以及帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的论述。指战员们表示，帝国主义和反动派的侵略本性是决不会改变的，我们一定要牢牢记住党中央、毛主席的教导，不但要警惕拿枪的公开的敌人，还要警惕不拿枪的隐藏的敌人，他们胆敢兴风作浪，就坚决、彻底、全部、干净地把他们消灭掉！
