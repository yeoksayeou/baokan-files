	The "Voice of the Thai People" radio station issued a commentary on August 12, celebrating the rapid development and growth of the Thai people's armed struggle against U.S. imperialism and the Thanom-Praphas military junta.

	The commentary stated that since the end of last year, U.S. imperialism and the Thanom-Praphas military junta have been brutally suppressing the Thai people. They attempted to extinguish the sparks of armed struggle among the Thai people. However, the facts of the past year have shown that the sparks of armed struggle among the Thai people have only grown stronger.

	The commentary said that the first clash between the Thai people's armed forces and the military police of U.S. imperialism and the Thanom-Praphas junta occurred in Nakho Phanon Province in northeastern Thailand. Now, the struggle has spread to the vast northeastern regions of Udon Thani, Ubon Ratchathani, Sakhon Nakhon, and Nakhon Phanom. In the south, it has spread from one region to the entire southern region. The frequency of battles has also rapidly increased. Preliminary statistics show that in the second half of last year, there were 24 clashes between the people's armed forces and U.S.-Thai military police in the northeast, which increased to 43 in the first half of this year. In the southern region, there were 5 clashes in the second half of last year, which increased to 51 in the first seven months of this year. The people's armed forces, using mobile and flexible tactics, have repeatedly foiled the enemy's "extermination" campaigns, killing a large number of enemies and seizing a large amount of weapons.

	The "Voice of the Thai People" radio station pointed out that the rapid development and growth of the Thai people's armed forces in the struggle have proven a truth: "As long as the oppressed and exploited people decide to take up arms and fight the enemy with a spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, the enemy will be powerless against the people, and the people will definitely defeat the seemingly powerful enemy."

	According to a report by the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station on August 16, the Thai people's armed forces, from April 5 to May 25, foiled the "extermination" campaign by U.S. imperialism and the Thanom-Praphas traitorous clique in the northeastern province of Sakhon Nakhon, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy.

	Under the command of U.S. military "advisors," the Thanom-Praphas junta deployed two battalions, part of the so-called "Volunteer Force for National Defense," and local police in this "extermination" campaign. The Thai people's armed forces fought bravely and skillfully, annihilating more than ten reactionary officers and more than 150 reactionary military police, and seizing a large number of cannons, light machine guns, and automatic rifles.

	In a battle in the Phu Phan mountain area, a unit of Thanom-Praphas junta's military police, after blindly shelling the mountain area with heavy artillery, was ambushed by the people's armed forces. The people's armed forces used hand grenades to kill dozens of enemies on the spot.

	In another battle, the Thanom-Praphas junta dispatched a large number of military police in two columns to surround a forest. The people's armed forces skillfully broke through the enemy's encirclement and lured the two enemy columns into firing at each other in the dark, causing more than 50 enemy casualties.

	The military police of the Thanom-Praphas junta, under the heavy blows of the people's armed forces, have low morale, and soldiers are deserting in droves.

　　拿起武器敢于战斗就能战胜貌似强大的敌人
　　泰国人民武装斗争烈火蔓延
    据新华社讯　曼谷消息：“泰国人民之声”电台十二日发表评论，欢呼泰国人民武装在反击美帝国主义和他侬—巴博集团的斗争中迅速发展壮大。
    评论说，美帝国主义和他侬—巴博集团的军警从去年底以来疯狂地镇压泰国人民。他们企图扑灭泰国人民武装斗争的星星之火。但是一年来的事实表明，泰国人民武装的星星之火却越烧越旺。
    评论说，泰国人民武装同美帝国主义和他侬—巴博集团军警的第一次交锋是在泰国东北部的那空拍侬府那家县，现在已经发展到乌隆、乌汶、沙功那空、廊开等府的广大东北部地区。在南部也已从一个地区遍及到整个南部地区。战斗的次数也迅速增多。据初步统计，在去年下半年的六个月里，东北部人民武装与美、泰军警战斗二十四次，今年上半年已增加到四十三次。在南部地区，去年下半年共战斗五次，今年头七个月已增加到五十一次。人民武装运用机动、灵活的战术，一次又一次地粉碎了敌人的“围剿”，杀伤了大量敌人，缴获了大批武器。
      “泰国人民之声”电台指出，泰国人民武装在斗争中迅速发展壮大的事实证明了一条真理，那就是：“只要被压迫、被剥削的人民下决心拿起武器，以敢于斗争、敢于胜利的精神同敌人进行斗争，敌人就无可奈何于人民，而人民必定战胜貌似强大的敌人。”
    据新华社十七日讯　曼谷消息：“泰国人民之声”电台十六日报道：泰国人民武装从四月五日到五月二十五日在泰国东北部沙功那空府粉碎了美帝国主义和他侬—巴博卖国集团的“围剿”，给敌人以惨重的打击。
    在美国军事“顾问”的指挥下，他侬—巴博集团在这次“围剿”中出动了两营兵力、一部分所谓“保卫国土志愿队”和地方警察。泰国人民武装英勇善战，共歼灭了反动军官十多名、反动军警一百五十多名，缴获了大炮、轻机枪和自动步枪等大批武器。
    在普攀山地区的一次战斗中，他侬—巴博集团的一队军警以猛烈炮火盲目轰击后开进山区时，遭到了人民武装的伏击。人民武装用手榴弹当场击毙了几十人。
    在另一次战斗中，他侬—巴博集团出动大批军警分成两路包围一片森林，人民武装巧妙地突破敌人的包围，并且引诱敌人两支队伍在黑暗中互相射击，使敌人伤亡五十多人。
    他侬—巴博集团的军警在人民武装的沉重打击下，士气低落，士兵纷纷开小差。
