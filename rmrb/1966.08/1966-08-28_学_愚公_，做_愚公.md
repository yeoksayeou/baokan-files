II. Read the Quotations (First demonstrate reading, then lead the reading)

III. Explanation

Tonight, we are studying this quotation from Chairman Mao's article "Yu Gong Moves the Mountains." "Yu Gong Moves the Mountains" is an article that Chairman Mao delivered on June 11, 1945, at the closing ceremony of the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

At that time, the overall situation at home and abroad was very good, and the revolutionary situation was very favorable. However, there were still many difficulties and obstacles on our path forward. As Chairman Mao said, there were still two big mountains of imperialism and feudalism on the heads of the Chinese people. To finally and thoroughly defeat Japanese imperialism, we still had to engage in arduous struggles. The most serious issue was that Japanese imperialism had not yet surrendered, and an even more vicious enemy, American imperialism, was actively supporting Chiang Kai-shek in his anti-communist activities, attempting to replace Japanese imperialism in China and turn China into its colony. Chiang Kai-shek was also actively preparing for a civil war, dreaming of eliminating the Communist Party and the revolutionary forces of the Chinese people.

It was at this time that Chairman Mao, in this article, used the parable of "Yu Gong Moves the Mountains" as an analogy to call on the entire Party and the people of the nation to persist in the revolution, to dig out the two big mountains of imperialism and feudalism that were pressing down on the Chinese people, and to build a new China. "Make up your mind, don't be afraid of sacrifice, and overcome all difficulties to win victory."

What is the story of "Yu Gong Moves the Mountains"?

(Explain the parable in the article "Yu Gong Moves the Mountains" — omitted)

The central idea of the quotation we are studying tonight is: Have great aspirations, set ambitious goals, dare to make a revolution, dare to struggle, and dare to win. When we study Chairman Mao's quotations and listen to Chairman Mao's words, we must greatly carry forward the revolutionary spirit of "Yu Gong Moves the Mountains," have revolutionary determination, be willing to take on heavy responsibilities, and dare to overcome all difficulties.

Our Huangshan Dong Brigade has achieved some results in production in the past, and many people who dare to struggle against difficulties, who are not afraid of hardship and fatigue, have emerged. However, can we say that we have completely acquired the revolutionary spirit of "Yu Gong Moves the Mountains"? We cannot say that. Compared to the people of Da Zhai, the gap is very large. We must quickly catch up and strive to catch up. The Party branch has called on us to basically change the face of Huangshan Dong's barren mountains, bad water, and infertile fields within three to five years, to achieve a thousand jin per mu, to achieve mechanized transportation, etc. To achieve these goals, there are indeed many difficulties in front of us. Just take our production team as an example: the yield of the paddy fields is very low, especially the fields in the Ma Kang Du section, which have the lowest yield and must be tackled first; but there are many difficulties: going there to plow the fields is far, and the fields are small and scattered, full of "raincoat hills" and "hat hills," making it hard to work. How should we deal with these difficulties? Our team has many members with the spirit of Yu Gong, such as Zhu Zhao Di and Chen Yun Di, who go to Ma Kang Du to plow the fields, starting work as soon as it is light, working with the greatest effort, not afraid of the distance, heavy loads, or hard work. Their spirit of not fearing difficulties and daring to overcome them should be greatly promoted. However, our team also has some members who are like the "wise old man" and are afraid of hardship and difficulty, dragging their feet to work, complaining about the distance and hard work when going to Ma Kang Du to plow the fields, and not willing to go there to work. This way of thinking is not good. There are even a few members who, because they are afraid of difficulties, advocate abandoning the fields in Ma Kang Du and not cultivating them. This way of thinking is even more unacceptable. Comrades, when we do revolutionary work, plow the fields, and engage in work, we will inevitably encounter difficulties. Chairman Mao teaches us: "We work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go, this is what a good comrade should do." The thought of fearing difficulties is very harmful. For example, if some comrades want to abandon the fields in Ma Kang Du, what kind of loss will this cause? Now let us calculate the accounts: Our production team has forty-five mu of fields in Ma Kang Du, with an annual yield of five hundred jin per mu, which can produce 22,500 jin of grain per year; with each person consuming five hundred jin of grain per year, it is enough for one person for forty-five years. The entire brigade has nine production teams. If everyone does this, it will reduce the grain yield by 202,500 jin per year. If this grain is sold to the state, the contribution to the state will be much greater; at the same time, the team can use the funds obtained from selling the surplus grain to carry out some basic construction, expand production, and solve transportation difficulties. This will be very beneficial to the state and the collective. We are farmers of the Mao Zedong era and must listen to Chairman Mao's words, with the revolutionary spirit of "Yu Gong Moves the Mountains," set the ambition to change heaven and earth. We must be pioneers of the socialist revolution, not mediocre people who do nothing. We must use our hands to change the face of Huangshan Dong and change the face of our country's poverty and backwardness. Comrades, please think about it, the thought of fearing difficulties and surrendering to difficulties will bring about great losses in politics and production! If we do not dare to struggle against difficulties and do not work hard, then changing the face of Huangshan Dong will become an empty talk, developing production and improving living standards will be impossible, and supporting the socialist construction of the motherland and supporting the world revolution will be even more out of the question.

Comrades, we must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Make up your mind, don't be afraid of sacrifice, and overcome all difficulties to win victory." We must criticize the cowardly thoughts and lazy habits of the "wise old man," carry forward the revolutionary spirit of Yu Gong, and set the ambition and revolutionary spirit of daring to make a revolution, daring to struggle, and daring to win. We listen to Chairman Mao's words and must take practical actions to change the face of Huangshan Dong and build it into a new socialist village. We must start by changing the face of the low-yield fields in Ma Kang Du, daring to advance in the face of difficulties.

### 学“愚公”，做“愚公”

专栏：

   学“愚公”，做“愚公”
   讲课人：坳下生产队辅导员、贫农　李新华
    毛主席语录
    下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。
                          《愚公移山》
    一、提问（复习、启发）
      （一）怎样发扬敢想、敢干、敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命干劲和革命精神，改变我们国家一穷二白的面貌？改变黄山洞的面貌？
      （二）我们要改造马坑肚的低产田，碰到很多困难，对待这些困难，应该抱什么态度？
    二、读语录（先示范读，后领读）
    三、讲解
    今晚学习的这条语录，是毛主席在《愚公移山》这篇文章中讲的。《愚公移山》这篇文章，是毛主席在一九四五年六月十一日在中国共产党第七次全国代表大会上所作的闭幕词。
    当时，国内外总的形势都很好，革命的形势十分有利。但是，我们在前进的道路上，还有很多困难和障碍。正如毛主席说的，在中国人民头上还压着帝国主义和封建主义两座大山。要最后彻底打败日本帝国主义，还要进行艰苦的斗争。特别严重的，是日本帝国主义还未投降，一个更凶恶的敌人美帝国主义，就积极扶蒋反共，企图代替日本帝国主义在中国的地位，把中国变为它的殖民地。蒋介石也在积极准备打内战，梦想消灭共产党和中国人民的革命力量。
    就是在这个时候，毛主席在这篇文章里，以“愚公移山”这个寓言故事作比喻，号召全党全国人民把革命坚持下去，挖掉压在中国人民头上的帝国主义和封建主义两座大山，建立新中国。“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
      “愚公移山”是怎样一回事呢？
      （讲《愚公移山》文内的寓言故事——略）
    我们今晚学习的这条语录的中心思想就是：树雄心，立壮志，敢于革命，敢于斗争，敢于胜利。我们学习毛主席语录，听毛主席的话，就要大大发扬“愚公移山”的革命精神，要有革命的坚定性，勇于挑重担子，敢于克服一切困难。
    我们黄山洞大队，前段生产工作是有成绩的，也涌现出不少敢于向困难作斗争、不怕苦、不怕累的好人好事。但是，能不能说我们已经完全有了“愚公移山”的革命精神了呢？还不能这样说。同大寨人比较起来，我们和他们的差距就十分大。我们要迅速赶上去，拚命赶上去。党支部号召我们，要在三、五年内基本上改变黄山洞穷山恶水瘦田的面貌，实现亩产千斤，实现交通运输车船化等等。要达到这些，在我们面前确实摆着不少困难。就拿我们生产队来说，水田的产量很低，特别是马坑肚那一段田的产量最低，一定要首先突破；但这又有许多困难：去那里耕田，路远，田丘又细（小），尽是“蓑衣丘”、“笠帽丘”，工夫难做。怎样对待这些困难呢？我们队有不少社员是有“愚公”精神的，象朱招娣、陈云娣等社员，去马坑肚耕田，天一亮就出勤，做工夫的劲头最大，不怕路远、担子重、工夫难。他们那种不怕困难、敢于战胜困难的精神，是要大大加以发扬的。可是我们队也有一些像“智叟”那样子的社员，怕苦，怕难，出勤拖拖拉拉，到马坑肚耕田埋怨路远、工夫难，不愿意到那里去做工。这种思想是不好的。还有个别社员由于害怕困难，甚至主张将马坑肚那段田丢荒不种。这种思想更加要不得。社员们，我们干革命，耕田，搞工作，总是会遇到困难的。毛主席教导我们：“我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”害怕困难的思想是十分有害的。譬如说，如果像有些社员那样，要将马坑肚那一段田丢荒的话，将会造成怎样的损失呢？现在就让我们来算一算账：我们生产队在马坑肚有四十五亩田，以每亩年产五百斤计，一年可收粮食二万二千五百斤；以每人每年吃粮五百斤计，足够一个人吃四十五年。全大队有九个生产队，如果都这样做，一年就会减收粮食二十万零二千五百斤。如将这笔粮食卖给国家，对国家的贡献就大得多了；同时，队里也可以利用这笔卖余粮得来的资金，搞一些基本建设，扩大生产，解决交通运输的困难。这样，对国家对集体都大有好处。我们是毛泽东时代的农民，一定要听毛主席的话，要以“愚公移山”的革命精神，树立改天换地的雄心壮志。要当社会主义革命的闯将，不做无所作为的庸人。要用我们的双手，改变黄山洞的面貌，改变我国一穷二白的面貌。社员们，请大家想一想，害怕困难，向困难投降，这种思想会在政治上和生产上带来多大的损失啊！如果我们不敢同困难作斗争，不是踏踏实实地干下去，那么，要改变黄山洞的面貌就会成为一句空话，要发展生产、改善生活也不可能，要支援祖国的社会主义建设，支援世界革命，那就更加谈不到了。
    社员们，我们要牢记毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”我们一定要批评“智叟”的懦夫思想和懒汉作风，发扬“愚公”的革命精神，树立敢于革命、敢于斗争、敢于胜利的雄心壮志和革命气概。我们听毛主席的话，就要以实际行动改变黄山洞的面貌，把黄山洞建设成为社会主义的新农村。我们要从改变马坑肚那段低产田的面貌做起，敢于迎着困难向前进。
    四、讨论
      （1）我们对待困难应该抱什么态度？
      （2）我们应当怎样发扬“愚公移山”的革命精神，来改变黄山洞的面貌？
    五、小结（略）
    六、抄语录
