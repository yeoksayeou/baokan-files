The Action Guideline for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution

	The Capital's Military and Civilian People Celebrate the Party Central Committee's Decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution

	People say: This document is the "compass" and "timely rain" for guiding the current struggle, and it will surely lead us to a thorough victory in the Cultural Revolution.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: The decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was broadcast this evening. The workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres of the capital were overjoyed and highly spirited, unanimously expressing their most enthusiastic support and determination to resolutely implement it. They said that the Central Committee's wise decision is the great program for guiding China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution at present, a document of great historical significance for the new stage of the socialist revolution, and the latest development of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

	Many revolutionary students in colleges and universities organized immediately after listening to the broadcast, holding high portraits of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong quotations, beating drums and gongs, singing revolutionary songs, and going to sister schools to celebrate in the rain. At Peking University, the joyous waves surged instantly. People gathered in the squares and on the roads, discussing enthusiastically and expressing their determination. Many revolutionary teachers and students held all-night discussions and wrote joyous reports, pasting them on the walls of classrooms, dormitories, and high walls. The revolutionary youngsters were particularly excited. They said that the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have special trust in the revolutionary masses and special concern for the youth, giving them the highest evaluation. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao attach great importance to cultivating successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution in the struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Chairman Mao has said, "The world is yours, it is also ours, but in the end, it is yours." We will not disappoint the expectations of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. We must dare to charge, dare to break through, dare to make revolution, and dare to fight in the great storms and waves of class struggle, "be willing to be skinned alive, and dare to pull the emperor off his throne." As long as we truly master Mao Zedong Thought, we will surely be able to defeat all anti-party cliques, overthrow all monsters and demons, and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Some standing committee members of the Cultural Revolution Preparatory Committee of Peking University and some students held an all-night discussion together.

We must implement the Central Committee's decision in our actual actions, charge forward in the Cultural Revolution, seize the revolution, and promote production, achieving a double harvest of revolution and production."

	The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Automobile Division were greatly inspired after hearing the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution on the radio. Worker representative Qi Wenliang excitedly said: "The Central Committee's decision is a powerful weapon for us to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. With this weapon, we will surely be able to overthrow and expose all anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought cliques, and carry out this great revolution that touches people's souls to the end."

	A group of revolutionary youngsters who had written to Chairman Mao to firmly support the reform of the educational system—many students from the Fourth Middle School in Beijing—held discussions tonight after listening to the Central Committee's decision on the radio. They excitedly said: It is precisely when we need the Party's policies the most that the great Party and Chairman Mao have timely given us instructions. Revolutionary Committee member Fan Susu said: The birth of this document is a model of coming from the masses and going to the masses. Every policy stipulated in the document represents the intentions of our revolutionary faction. We must strive to temper ourselves in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, be good students of Chairman Mao, and successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution.
