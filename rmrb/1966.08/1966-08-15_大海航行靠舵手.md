In the new stage of our country's socialist revolution, at this crucial moment in the development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong personally presided over the convening of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. This meeting is a milestone in the new stage of our country's socialist revolution.

In a socialist country, after the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, the question of which road to take still remains. Is it to carry the socialist revolution through to the end and gradually transition to communism? Or is it to stop halfway and regress to capitalism? This question is sharply posed before us. Comrade Mao Zedong has summed up and learned from the positive and negative experiences of our country's revolution and the international communist movement, and has answered this question in theory; in practice, he is gradually solving this problem.

At the Tenth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party in 1962, Comrade Mao Zedong once again emphasized the theory of contradictions, classes, and class struggle in socialist society, and called on us to never forget class struggle. In recent years, Comrade Mao Zedong has put forward a series of wise decisions on the socialist revolution and socialist construction, a series of important instructions on the socialist education movement and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and a series of major policies on opposing imperialism, on establishing the broadest international united front against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, on opposing modern revisionism, and on supporting the revolutionary struggles of all oppressed peoples and nations in the world. These are fundamental issues for consolidating our country's proletarian dictatorship and socialist system, preventing revisionism from usurping the leadership of the Party and the state, preventing the restoration of capitalism, and ensuring that our country adheres to proletarian internationalism.

The voyage of the sea depends on the helmsman!

The great helmsman of our country's revolution is Comrade Mao Zedong.

For decades, whenever our country's revolution has reached a critical juncture, it has been because the Party and the masses have had a brilliant helmsman like Comrade Mao Zedong at the helm, with the great thought of Mao Zedong as our guide, clearing away the fog, correcting the course, and enabling our revolutionary ship to navigate past countless shoals and reefs, and to advance victoriously along the revolutionary course of Marxism-Leninism in the midst of storms and waves.

Lenin said: "Without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement." Indeed, without the thought of Mao Zedong, there would be no great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China, no victory for our country's democratic revolution and socialist revolution, no new China, and we would not be able to build our country into a great socialist state, nor would we be able to make our country's people stand up forever and march forward in the world.

Comrade Lin Biao correctly pointed out the extreme importance of the thought of Mao Zedong to our country's revolution and future. He said: "Our country is a great socialist state under the dictatorship of the proletariat, with a population of 700 million. We need a unified thought, a revolutionary thought, a correct thought, and that is the thought of Mao Zedong."

The fundamental task of our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to make the thought of Mao Zedong widely grasped by the masses, to further promote the revolutionization of people's thinking, and to further transform spiritual strength into a magnificent material force for transforming society and nature.

Let us raise the great red banner of the thought of Mao Zedong even higher, unite more closely around the Party Central Committee with Comrade Mao Zedong as its head, strive to implement the various policies pointed out in the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, unite all those who can be united, rely on our own efforts, strive to overcome all obstacles and difficulties, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, carry the socialist revolution through to the end, and carry the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism through to the end.

Strive to build our country into a powerful socialist state.

Strive to unite the peoples of the world, to build a new world without imperialism, without capitalism, and without systems of exploitation.

Long live the great unity of the Chinese people!

Long live the great unity of the peoples of the world!

　　大海航行靠舵手
    在我国社会主义革命的新阶段，在无产阶级文化大革命发展的关键时刻，毛泽东同志亲自主持举行了党的八届十一中全会。这次会议，是我国社会主义革命新阶段的里程碑。
    社会主义国家，在基本完成生产资料所有制方面的社会主义改造以后，仍然存在着走什么道路的问题。是把社会主义革命进行到底，逐步向共产主义过渡？还是半途而废，向资本主义倒退？这个问题，尖锐地摆在人们面前。毛泽东同志总结和吸取了我国革命和国际共产主义运动的正反两面的经验，在理论上，回答了这个问题；在实践中，正在逐步解决这个问题。
    毛泽东同志在一九六二年党的八届十中全会上，再一次强调了关于社会主义社会的矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争的理论，向我们提出了千万不要忘记阶级斗争的伟大号召。近几年来，毛泽东同志又提出了关于社会主义革命和社会主义建设的一系列英明决策，提出了关于社会主义教育运动和无产阶级文化大革命的一系列重要指示，提出了关于反对帝国主义，关于建立反对美帝国主义及其走狗的最广泛的国际统一战线，关于反对现代修正主义，支持世界一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族的革命斗争的一系列重大方针。这些，对于巩固我国的无产阶级专政和社会主义制度，防止修正主义篡夺党和国家的领导，防止资本主义复辟，保证我国坚持无产阶级国际主义，都是根本性的问题。
    大海航行靠舵手！
    我国革命的伟大舵手就是毛泽东同志。
    几十年来，每当我国革命的重要关头，都是因为党和人民群众有毛泽东同志这样天才的舵手掌舵，有伟大的毛泽东思想作指南，拨开迷雾，端正航向，使我们革命的大船，能够绕过无数的险滩和暗礁，在大风大浪中，沿着马克思列宁主义的革命航道，胜利前进。
    列宁说：“没有革命的理论，就不会有革命的运动。”确实是这样。没有毛泽东思想，就没有伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党，就没有我国民主革命和社会主义革命的胜利，就没有新中国，就不能把我国建设成为伟大的社会主义国家，就不能使我国人民在世界上永远站起来，永远向前进。
    林彪同志很正确地说明了毛泽东思想对我国革命和我国前途的极端重要性。他说：“我国是一个伟大的无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，有七亿人口，需要有一个统一的思想，革命的思想，正确的思想，这就是毛泽东思想。”
    我国无产阶级文化大革命的根本任务，就是要使毛泽东思想最广泛地为群众所掌握，进一步促进人的思想革命化，进一步把精神力量变成改造社会、改造自然的宏伟的物质力量。
    让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，更紧密地团结在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的周围，努力实行党的八届十一中全会公报指出的各项政策，团结一切可以团结的人们，自力更生，奋发图强，克服一切阻力和困难，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把社会主义革命进行到底，把反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的斗争进行到底。
    为把我国建设成为一个强大的社会主义国家而奋斗。
    为联合世界各国人民，建立一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界而奋斗。
    中国人民大团结万岁！
    世界人民大团结万岁！
