Truly the Good Students and Soldiers of Chairman Mao, Truly the Successors to the Cause of the Proletarian Revolution
What Chairman Mao says, the Red Guards do
Millions of people enthusiastically cheer: The revolutionary actions of the Red Guards are excellent!

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 29th, workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals from all over the country enthusiastically cheer the heroic Red Guards for their pioneering role in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and for their great achievements in the storm of destroying the "Four Olds" and establishing the "Four News." They enthusiastically cheer the heroic Red Guards as critics of the old world, builders of the new world, heroic sons and daughters of the Chinese people, and good students and soldiers of Chairman Mao.

Revolutionary masses from various places believe that in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the appearance of the Red Guards and their role as the vanguard of this great revolutionary movement, together with the broad revolutionary masses, have turned the Cultural Revolution into a great mass revolutionary movement that touches upon politics and economics. This fact fully proves that China's revolutionary youth are staunch defenders and reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, and it is a manifestation of Mao Zedong Thought deeply rooted in people's hearts. They cheer: The revolutionary actions of the Red Guards are excellent! Long live the heroic Red Guards!

Revolutionary workers in the capital enthusiastically praise the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards, saying, "We workers must, together with the Red Guards, use the revolutionary hammer to smash the remnants of feudalism, use the revolutionary broom to sweep away the poison of capitalism, and use the revolutionary broadsword to cut off the roots of revisionism!" The workers of the No. 3 blast furnace team B of the Shishan Ironworks wrote a letter full of revolutionary enthusiasm, supporting the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards. The letter said: "Your spirit of daring to think, daring to break through, daring to do, daring to revolt, and daring to rebel greatly inspires us. We are determined to learn from you and vow to be your strong backing." The old worker Hang Baohua of the "February 7th" group in the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory said: "The Red Guards listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. We 'February 7th' old workers see such revolutionary successors, and we are truly happy!" The old workers of the Dongfanghong Textile Mill (formerly Chongwen Textile Mill) in Beijing fought side by side with the Red Guards, exposing and fighting against the heinous crimes of some demons and monsters.

The working class and revolutionary masses of Shanghai enthusiastically praised the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards, saying that they have shaken the old world and swept away the remnants of the bourgeoisie's arrogance in society, greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary people and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat, consolidating the proletarian's mountain stronghold. National advanced producer Yu Yongkang said: The Red Guards used the revolutionary mirror to expose those reactionary parasites and bloodsuckers hiding in the dark corners. They raised the revolutionary broom to sweep away all the remnants of the bourgeoisie and feudalism. Their revolutionary manifesto fiercely attacks all the ideological remnants of the exploiting classes. Their great achievements have written a brilliant new chapter in the great revolutionary history of our country. We, the working class, salute the heroic Red Guard fighters! An old retired worker, seeing the Red Guards parading those harmful creatures, excitedly said: Seeing the actions of the revolutionary youngsters, it is truly indescribably satisfying. Only by thoroughly eliminating those harmful creatures can we uproot capitalism and revisionism, ensuring that our socialist mountain stronghold will never change color.

The workers, suburban commune members, and revolutionary cadres of Shenyang City enthusiastically cheered and paid tribute to the Red Guard youngsters, unanimously praising them as good students of Chairman Mao, doing the right thing, and doing it well. Li Suwen, the deputy political instructor of the Dongfanghong Foodstuffs Store in Shenyang City, said: "The young revolutionaries have created an unstoppable revolutionary momentum in the Cultural Revolution, and the demons and monsters hiding in the dark corners have been exposed and trampled underfoot by them. The youngsters have done a great job!" Wang Feng'en, a representative of the National People's Congress, a model worker in industry, and deputy chief engineer of the Shenyang Transformer Factory, said: "Our Red Guards are very brave. As soon as they take the field, they not only sweep away the 'Four Olds' but also bravely expose those hidden parasites and bloodsuckers, exposing them under the bright sunlight, greatly diminishing the enemy's arrogance and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must learn from the fearless revolutionary spirit of the Red Guard youngsters and be their strong backing."

The revolutionary masses of Zhengzhou City have posted millions of big-character posters in recent days, paying tribute to the heroic Red Guards. Wu Suozhen, a model worker from Zhengzhou Cotton Mill No. 3, excitedly said: The Red Guards are the vanguard in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, shaking the old world and sweeping away all the old customs and habits of the exploiting classes. The revolutionary actions of the Red Guards are excellent, and we must learn from the Red Guards' revolutionary spirit of daring to speak, daring to break through, and daring to do, and fight together with them. Guo Qingxiu, a worker from the mobile workshop and an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, said, the Red Guards have done well, a thousand times well, ten thousand times well! Their revolutionary actions fully express the wishes of our working class, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and defending the socialist mountain stronghold. We enthusiastically cheer "Long live the Red Guards!" The revolutionary staff of Zhengzhou Department Store said: The editorial in the People's Daily, "Salute to Our Red Guards," speaks for our hearts. The Red Guard youngsters are our good examples to learn from!

In the streets of Lanzhou City, there are slogans everywhere posted by workers, peasants, and revolutionary cadres, saying "Salute to the Red Guards," "Learn from the Red Guards," and "Firmly support the revolutionary actions of the revolutionary students." Ding Yuanzeng, a model worker from the Second Wool Textile Mill in Lanzhou, said: The Red Guards and revolutionary students, according to Chairman Mao's instructions, dare to sacrifice themselves and dare to pull the emperor down from his throne, dare to break through, dare to do, and dare to revolt. We workers firmly stand with them and support their revolutionary actions. Liu Xizong, the party branch secretary of Zhangsutian Brigade, Yantian Commune, Lanzhou City, and an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, excitedly said: The Red Guards have fiercely attacked those in power who are taking the capitalist road and all the demons and monsters. This revolutionary spirit and action of rebellion are completely in line with Chairman Mao's words and are in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought. They are our good examples to learn from.

More than ten thousand active learners of Chairman Mao's works participating in the conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works in Jiang County, Shanxi Province, enthusiastically praised the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards and vowed to be their strong backing. They also expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly uproot all the demons and monsters, and strive for the renovation of the socialist system to the end.

The officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces most enthusiastically cheer the proletarian revolutionary spirit of the Red Guards and most resolutely support the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards. Feng Fusheng, the political instructor of a certain unit of the air force on the front line in Fujian, said, the Red Guards and revolutionary youth, under the guidance of the Party and Chairman Mao, have consciously listened to Chairman Mao's words and consciously learned from the PLA in the storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, becoming the vanguard of this great revolutionary movement, making me feel greatly inspired. We are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, together with the Red Guards, shoulder to shoulder, to sweep away all the demons and monsters. Eight soldiers guarding a certain island on the front line in Fujian recently jointly wrote a letter to the Red Guards in the capital, saying, we are stationed on the front-line island, but our hearts are connected with millions of revolutionary youth. Red Guard youngsters, bravely fight on! We will always fight with you, vowing to smash the old world to pieces and build a brand-new world in the struggle!

The Red Guards of Red Guard School (formerly the affiliated middle school of Tsinghua University) are seriously studying and discussing the "Sixteen Points," resolutely acting in accordance with the "Sixteen Points."
