Congolese (Brazzaville) Chargé d'Affaires Hosts Reception to Celebrate the Third Anniversary of the August Revolution

Jean Daniel Bakula, Chargé d'Affaires of the Congolese (Brazzaville) Embassy in China, held a reception this afternoon to celebrate the third anniversary of the August Revolution in Congo (Brazzaville).

Bakula and Vice Premier Chen Yi both spoke at the reception. Bakula emphasized that the Congolese (Brazzaville) people had seized true independence from the imperialists through violence; they knew that the enemy would eventually return, and to defend the revolution and the achievements it had won, they must immediately and resolutely take up arms to strike the enemy.

Vice Premier Chen Yi warmly congratulated the Congolese (Brazzaville) people on their successful defense of their nation under the leadership of President Massamba-Debat and Prime Minister N'Gouabi, and on their recent thwarting of a counter-revolutionary coup d'état orchestrated by the imperialists led by the United States in collusion with reactionaries within Congo (Brazzaville). He pointed out that the aggressive nature of the old and new colonialism led by the United States would never change. We must use the people's revolutionary armed forces to oppose the imperialists' counter-revolutionary armed forces and use revolutionary warfare of the people to eliminate the imperialists' aggressive wars.

Vice Chairman Dong Biwu, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Yang Mingxuan, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Gao Chongmin, President of the Supreme People's Court Yang Xiufeng, and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Qiao Qingfeng attended the reception.

When discussing the friendly relations between Congo (Brazzaville) and China, the Chargé d'Affaires said that today, the friendship between Congo and China is deepening and strengthening, and in the future, it will become even closer. This is because they have formed a common front in the decisive struggle against international imperialism led by the United States. The Chargé d'Affaires said that no matter what tricks the imperialists play, there will never be any shadows in the friendship, amity, and cooperation between the People's Republic of China and Congo.

Bakula said that the Congolese people fully support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism. The Congolese people fully support the statements made by Chairman Liu Shaoqi and Premier Zhou Enlai regarding the unjust war imposed by U.S. imperialism on the Vietnamese people. The Congolese people reject all "peace talks" proposed by the American aggressors and refuse the so-called "peaceful coexistence" that allows a few major countries to continue their aggression, rule, exploitation, ridicule, and enslavement of small nations.

In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi warmly praised the Congolese (Brazzaville) people for their unyielding struggle to maintain national independence and consolidate revolutionary achievements. He said that the government and people of Congo (Brazzaville) are taking a series of revolutionary measures: further mobilizing the broad masses of the people; strengthening national armed self-defense forces; resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionaries. We are confident that as long as the government and people of Congo (Brazzaville) strengthen national unity, rely closely on the masses, persist in long-term struggle, and resolutely implement these revolutionary measures, they will certainly be able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles and foil all the imperialists' plots and tricks.

Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out that the many facts that have occurred in Congo, Vietnam, and other countries and regions in Asia and Africa all show that maintaining colonial rule and seizing colonial interests are the nature of the old and new colonialism led by the United States. Their two aggressive natures will never change. He stressed that the peoples of Asia and Africa must engage in a struggle of equals against imperialist control, interference, subversion, and aggression.

He said that the great struggle and brilliant victories of the Vietnamese people in their resistance against American aggression and for national salvation have pointed out the only correct path for all oppressed nations in Asia, Africa, and the world to achieve true independence and complete liberation.

Vice Premier Chen Yi reaffirmed that the Chinese people will, as always, firmly support the Congolese (Brazzaville) people in their struggle against imperialism and for the maintenance of national independence. China is willing to continue to support the Congolese (Brazzaville) people in their self-reliant development of the national economy in the fields of economic and technological cooperation and other aspects. He expressed his belief that the friendly cooperative relations between the peoples of China and Congo (Brazzaville) will be further consolidated and developed in the common struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism.

    据新华社十四日讯　刚果（布）驻中国大使馆临时代办让·丹尼尔·巴库拉今天下午举行招待会，庆祝刚果（布）八月革命三周年。
    巴库拉临时代办和陈毅副总理先后在招待会上讲话。巴库拉强调说，刚果（布）人民用暴力从帝国主义者手中夺取了真正独立；他们深知敌人迟早会卷土重来，为了保卫革命和捍卫革命已经取得的成果，必须立即并坚决地拿起武器来打击敌人。
    陈毅副总理热烈祝贺刚果（布）人民在马桑巴—代巴总统和努马扎莱总理的领导下，拿起武器，不久前又一次成功地挫败了以美国为首的帝国主义勾结刚果（布）国内反动派发动的反革命军事政变。他指出，以美国为首的新老殖民主义的侵略本性是绝不会改变的。我们要用人民革命武装来反对帝国主义反革命武装，要用人民革命战争来消灭帝国主义的侵略战争。
    董必武副主席，国务院副总理薄一波，人大常委会副委员长杨明轩，政协全国委员会副主席高崇民，最高人民法院院长杨秀峰，外交部副部长姬鹏飞等，出席了招待会。
    临时代办谈到刚果（布）和中国的友好关系时说，今天，刚果和中国之间的友谊正在日益加深巩固，今后还将更加接近，这是因为他们组成了为反对以美国为首的国际帝国主义而进行决定性斗争的共同阵线。临时代办说，不论帝国主义者玩弄什么花招，在中华人民共和国和刚果之间的友谊、亲善和合作方面将永远不会出现任何阴影。
    巴库拉说，刚果人民对越南人民反对美帝国主义的斗争表示完全的支持。刚果人民完全支持刘少奇主席和周恩来总理关于美帝国主义把非正义战争强加于越南人民的声明，刚果人民摒弃美国侵略者所提出的一切“和平谈判”，拒绝那种只许世界上几个大国继续侵略、统治、剥削、嘲弄和奴役弱小国家的所谓“和平共处”。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中热烈赞扬刚果（布）人民，为了维护民族独立，巩固革命成果，进行了坚持不懈的斗争。他说，刚果（布）政府和人民正在采取一系列的革命措施：进一步动员广大人民群众；加强民族武装自卫力量；坚决镇压反革命分子。我们深信，刚果（布）政府和人民只要加强民族团结，紧紧依靠群众，坚持长期斗争，坚决贯彻这些革命措施，就一定能够战胜一切困难和障碍，挫败帝国主义的一切阴谋诡计。
    陈毅副总理指出，在刚果、越南和亚非其他国家和地区所发生的许多事实都说明，维护殖民统治和攫取殖民利益，是以美国为首的新老殖民主义的本性，它们这两种侵略本性是绝不会改变的。他强调说，亚非各国人民必须同帝国主义的控制、干涉、颠覆和侵略，进行针锋相对的斗争。
    他说，越南人民抗美救国的伟大斗争和辉煌胜利，为亚非和全世界一切被压迫民族，指出了争取真正独立和彻底解放的唯一正确道路。
    陈毅副总理重申，中国人民将一如既往，坚决支持刚果（布）人民反对帝国主义、维护民族独立的斗争。中国愿意在经济技术合作和其他方面，继续支援刚果（布）人民自力更生地发展民族经济。他表示深信，中国和刚果（布）两国人民之间的友好合作关系，必将在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的共同斗争中，日益巩固和发展。
