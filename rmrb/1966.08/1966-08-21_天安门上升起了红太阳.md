Today,
Is the most unforgettable, most unforgettable day of our lives—
We saw our most beloved Chairman Mao!
Chairman Mao is wearing a green military uniform,
With a red cap insignia and red armband;
Chairman Mao is wearing a red scarf,
Chairman Mao is also wearing a red armband.
Chairman Mao is radiant with red light,
The red sun rises over Tiananmen!
Chairman Mao takes off his cap and waves to us repeatedly,
Chairman Mao's voice echoes in our ears:
"You must care about the affairs of the state,
Carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end!"
We have noted it, we have noted it,
Beloved Chairman Mao,
Your words we will always, always remember.
Chairman Mao's figure is reflected in the blue sky,
Chairman Mao's teachings are engraved in our hearts.
Endless happiness, endless pride,
Unparalleled excitement, supreme glory.
Chairman Mao gives us immense encouragement,
Chairman Mao gives us the power to turn the world upside down.
Chairman Mao is the supreme commander of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat,
We must, under Chairman Mao's leadership,
Smash the old world,
Eliminate the pests,
Realize the highest ideal of communism.

  天安门上升起了红太阳
  今天，
  是我们一生中最难忘、最难忘的日子——
  我们见到了最最敬爱的毛主席！
  毛主席穿着绿军装，
  红色的帽徽红领章；
  毛主席戴着红领巾，
  毛主席还戴着红袖章。
  毛主席满身放红光，
  天安门上升起了红太阳！
  毛主席摘下军帽向我们频频挥动，
  毛主席的声音又在我们耳边回响：
  “你们要关心国家大事，
  要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”
  记下了，记下了，
  敬爱的毛主席，
  您的话我们永远、永远要牢记。
  毛主席的身影映在蓝天上，
  毛主席的教导刻在我们心坎上。
  无限的幸福、无限的骄傲，
  无比的激动、无上的荣光。
  毛主席给我们无比巨大的鼓舞，
  毛主席给我们翻天覆地的力量。
  毛主席是无产阶级文化大革命的最高统帅，
  我们一定要在毛主席的带领下，
  砸碎旧世界，
  扫除害人虫，
  实现共产主义的最高理想。
