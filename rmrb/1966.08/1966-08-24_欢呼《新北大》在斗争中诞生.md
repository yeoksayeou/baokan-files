Our most beloved leader Chairman Mao has personally inscribed the name "New Peking University" for the new publication of Peking University.

Chairman Mao's inscription is a manifestation of his boundless concern and great encouragement for the revolutionary teachers and students of Peking University, as well as for the hundreds of millions of soldiers in the nationwide proletarian cultural revolution.

Two months ago, seven comrades from the Philosophy Department of Peking University, including Nie Yuanzi, posted the first big-character poster to open fire on the reactionary stronghold in the educational sector. This shot opened a breach in the stronghold of counter-revolutionary revisionism.

Chairman Mao, with the highest revolutionary fervor, supported this big-character poster, praising it as the first Marxist-Leninist big-character poster in the country.

On June 2, the commentary "Hail the Big-Character Poster at Peking University" in this newspaper said: The revolutionary struggle of the broad masses of teachers and students at Peking University against the representatives of the bourgeoisie will surely be victorious. A thriving, genuinely socialist new Peking University will soon appear in the capital of the people.

Now, the new Peking University is being born in the blazing fire of the proletarian cultural revolution.

Chairman Mao's inscription for "New Peking University" has stirred up boundless revolutionary enthusiasm among the revolutionary teachers and students of Peking University.

The revolutionary teachers and students regard Chairman Mao's inscription as a mobilization order and a call to smash the old Peking University and build a new one.

Chairman Mao said: "The birth of a new social system is always accompanied by a great clamor, which is to propagate the superiority of the new system and criticize the backwardness of the old system." He also said: "A brand-new social system must be established on the foundation of the old system, and it must clear away this foundation."

To destroy the old and establish the new means that without destroying the old, it is impossible to establish the new. Without overthrowing and smashing the reactionary forces of the bourgeoisie in the old Peking University, it is impossible to have the birth and establishment of a revolutionary new Peking University of the proletariat.

We must shout loudly for the birth of everything new under the socialist system. Through great struggle, great criticism, and great reform, we must thoroughly clean away all the mud and debris, broken bricks and tiles on the foundation of the old system. On the cleaned foundation, we must build every school and every unit into a fighting fortress of the proletarian revolution.

To shout loudly for the destruction of the old and the establishment of the new is the fighting task of "New Peking University," which has just been published, as well as the fighting task of all proletarian revolutionary publications.

Our revolutionary publications must enthusiastically support Chairman Mao, warmly support the leftists, and severely strike down the rightists and all ghosts and monsters. We must always maintain a red flag, propagate and mobilize the masses to carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end and carry the socialist revolution through to the end.

### 欢呼《新北大》在斗争中诞生

    欢呼《新北大》在斗争中诞生
    我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席，为北京大学新校刊亲笔题了“新北大”三个字。
    毛主席的题字，是对北京大学革命师生的无限关怀和巨大鼓舞，也是对全国无产阶级文化革命的亿万大军的无限关怀和巨大鼓舞。
    两个多月以前，北京大学哲学系聂元梓等七位同志，贴出了第一张向教育界顽固的反动堡垒开炮的大字报。这一炮，在反革命修正主义的阵地上，打开了一个突破口。
    毛主席以最高的革命热情，支持这张大字报，把它誉为全国第一张马克思列宁主义的大字报。
    六月二日，本报《欢呼北大的一张大字报》的评论中说过：北京大学广大师生的反对资产阶级代表人物的革命斗争，一定能够胜利。一个欣欣向荣的真正的社会主义的新北大，一定会很快地出现在人民的首都。
    现在，新北大正在无产阶级文化大革命的烈火中诞生。
    毛主席为《新北大》题字，在北大革命师生中激起了万丈革命豪情。
    广大革命师生把毛主席的题字，看作是砸碎旧北大、创建新北大的动员令和号召书。
    毛主席说：“一个新的社会制度的诞生，总是要伴随一场大喊大叫的，这就是宣传新制度的优越性，批判旧制度的落后性。”又说：“一个崭新的社会制度要从旧制度的基地上建立起来，它就必须清除这个基地。”
    破旧立新，就是说，不破旧的，就不可能立新的。不把旧北大的那些资产阶级反动势力打倒、打碎，就不可能有无产阶级的革命的新北大诞生出来、建立起来。
    我们一定要为社会主义新制度下的一切新事物的诞生大喊大叫。要经过大斗争、大批判、大改革，彻底清除旧制度基地上一切污泥浊水、破砖烂瓦，在打扫干净的基地上，把每个学校、每个单位都建设成为无产阶级革命的战斗堡垒。
    为破旧立新而大喊大叫，这是刚刚创刊的《新北大》的战斗任务，也是一切无产阶级革命报刊的战斗任务。
    我们革命报刊，一定要热烈地拥护毛主席，热情地支持左派，狠狠地打击右派和一切牛鬼蛇神，永远保持鲜红的旗帜，宣传和动员广大群众把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把社会主义革命进行到底。
