Title: Advancing by Dividing into Two

Today, the entire factory held a meeting to commend our workshop. The factory director also personally read our shift handover log to everyone, urging everyone to learn from us, to use Mao Zedong Thought to transform our thinking and guide production. In the past, we did not heed Chairman Mao's words well when receiving praise, which led to arrogance and complacency, concealing contradictions and causing unnecessary losses in work. This time, we are determined to find our shortcomings when praised.

Mao Zedong teaches us: "Modesty helps one go forward, whereas conceit makes one lag behind." Our comrades on the day shift did a good job. Comparing with them, we feel ashamed. We have decided to paint the three new pipelines of the silicone heater with lead oil to prevent rainwater corrosion. This is also a responsibility to the people.

During the inspection, we found that some valves were rusted, which made us feel uneasy. The Party has entrusted us with this important post. Such irresponsibility is a crime against the people and the Party.

Recognizing our shortcomings in work, we mixed the lead oil and painted 90 valves, taking practical actions to counterattack the anti-Party clique's assault.

We are the first shift of 199 days, and tomorrow will be the 200th day of safe operation. At this time, our heads are most likely to be hot, and we are most likely to be intoxicated by victory. Therefore, we must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Whoever sees only the bright side and not the difficult side will not be able to struggle well for the realization of the Party's tasks."

During our shift, it rained heavily, but everyone at each post was as diligent as on a sunny day, standing firm against the wind and thunder, carefully checking and adjusting to ensure stable operation and qualified quality. Comrade Shen Yunqi, who was still sick, insisted on coming to work. Zhang Qingmin braved the heavy rain to check the equipment outside. Although he was chilled from his feet to his head, he remained spirited.

Mao Zedong tells us: "The history of mankind is a history of constantly progressing from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom." Our set of equipment has been safely operated for 200 days, which also proves that Chairman Mao's teachings are great truths. In the future, we must hold the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, take steady steps, ensure hard quality, and create new records.

The tense moment caused by the power restriction during the shift change has passed, production is normal, and the quality is qualified. After the shift change, the operating conditions of the day shift are maintained, and the operation is stable. Mao Zedong says: "Those who guide wars cannot exceed the limits allowed by objective conditions to seek victory in war, but they can and must strive for victory within the limits of objective conditions." Once the power supply becomes abnormal, it is impossible for us to maintain stable production. But when problems arise, we must take correct measures to prevent the expansion of accidents, especially to protect the catalyst, which is something we should and must do. Therefore, we must be well prepared for power outage accidents again.

    一分为二不断前进
    一九六六年六月二日
    值班人　张雨林　谭乃树
    今天全厂大会又表扬了咱们车间，同时厂长又把咱岗位交接班日记亲自念给大家听，要求大家学习我们，用毛泽东思想改造思想，指导生产。过去咱们在表扬面前没有很好地听毛主席的话，产生了骄傲自满情绪，掩盖了矛盾，曾给工作带来不应有的损失。这次我们坚决要在表扬面前大找自己的不足。
    一九六六年六月二十一日
    值班人　王光荣　沈运启
    毛主席教导我们：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后。”上班同志干得很好，一对照，我们深感惭愧。我们下定决心把硅胶加热器的三条新管线用铅油刷好，以避免雨水腐蚀。这也是对人民负责任。
    在巡回检查时，发现有些阀门生了锈，心中难受。党把这个非常重要的岗位交给我们。如此不负责任，这是对人民、对党的犯罪。
    认识到我们工作的不足，就找铅油调合，刷阀门九十个，以实际行动回击反党黑帮的进攻。
    一九六六年七月六日
    值班人　田精敏　范春甫
    我们是一百九十九天第一个班，明天就是安全操作二百天。在这个时候，我们的脑袋最容易发热，最容易被胜利冲昏。因此，必须时时不忘毛主席教导：“谁要是只看见光明一面，不看见困难一面，谁就会不能很好地为实现党的任务而斗争。”
    在我们值班时间内，下了大雨，但是各个岗位每个人都和晴天一样，风吹不倒，雷打不动地认真进行检查，细心调整，使之操作平稳，质量合格。沈运启同志病还没好坚持上班，张庆民顶着大雨在外边检查设备，虽然从脚下一直凉到头顶，但他照样精神抖擞。
    一九六六年七月十三日
    值班人　刘云奇　翟稳
    毛主席告诉我们：“人类的历史，就是一个不断地从必然王国向自由王国发展的历史。”我们这套装置安全开炼二百天，也证明了毛主席的教导是伟大的真理。今后必须更加把毛泽东思想红旗举得高高的，步子走得稳稳的，质量硬硬的，创造新纪录。
    一九六六年七月十四日
    值班人　李留新　王淑琴
    接班时由于限电引起的一场紧张时刻已经过去，生产正常，质量合格，接班后维持上班条件，平稳操作。毛主席说：“指导战争的人们不能超越客观条件许可的限度期求战争的胜利，然而可以而且必须在客观条件的限度之内，能动地争取战争的胜利。”一旦供电失去正常，我们仍要平稳生产当然是办不到的。但当问题出现后采取正确的措施，防止事故的扩大，特别是保护好催化剂，是应当而且是必须的，因此我们要再度做好停电事故的准备。
