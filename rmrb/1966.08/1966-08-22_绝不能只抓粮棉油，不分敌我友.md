Title: We Must Not Focus Only on Grain, Cotton, and Oil Without Distinguishing Between Enemies and Friends

What is the production relationship? Chairman Mao has given clear instructions: "In various class societies, the members of various classes then, in various ways, form definite production relationships to engage in production activities to solve the problem of human material life." This means that production relationships are the relationships between people in the process of social production. In class societies, production relationships are class relationships. In a socialist society, there are still classes, and the production relationships in a socialist society are also relationships between classes.

Sun Yefang absurdly claims that the "contradiction between 'people' and 'things'" is the "deepest intrinsic contradiction of the socialist economy"; that all economic problems are problems of the relationship between people and things. According to him, in socialist construction, there are only relationships and contradictions between people and things, and no class relationships and class contradictions. He suggests that we only need to struggle against nature and the earth, and not against class enemies; we can bury our heads in construction, focus only on grain, cotton, and oil, and not distinguish between enemies and friends. His intentions are extremely malicious. He attempts to disarm us ideologically, making us lose our class vigilance and be defeated in the fierce and complex class struggle.

Do the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists now consider themselves part of the same family with us, the laboring people, and can "coexist peacefully"? No, absolutely not. We clearly know that the overthrown landlords and bourgeoisie, although they have been defeated, their hearts are still alive, dreaming day and night of restoring feudalism and capitalism. Between us, there is a clear life-and-death class struggle. What kind of "people and things" relationship is this?

In our economic front, the struggle against the "three autonomies and one contract," the struggle against embezzlement and theft, the struggle against capitalist management ideas, and so on, are these not struggles between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between the socialist road and the capitalist road? Are they not problems of "people and things"?

Take our military logistics and financial work as an example. Is it about implementing the spirit of hard work and frugality in building the army, or is it about extravagance and waste? Is it about using funds to build, or to consume? Is it about serving the broad masses of soldiers and officers, or about creating privileges for a few? This kind of ideological struggle is a reflection of the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between the socialist road and the capitalist road in logistics and financial work. If we follow Sun Yefang's advice, focusing only on the contradictions between people and things, burying our heads in managing money and things, and not grasping the struggle between the two ideologies, then we will become people without political awareness. We will not believe in his nonsense and will definitely grasp the struggle to promote the proletariat and eliminate the bourgeoisie, fighting to achieve the extremely proletarian and extremely revolutionary nature of the army.

From the perspective of our own revolutionization, it is the same. Revolutionary fighters are not living in a vacuum and will also be influenced by class struggles in society and the ideas of the exploiting classes. Do we not need to conduct self-reform, just focusing on production and work? No, absolutely not. Chairman Mao teaches us to reform the objective world while reforming the subjective world, to reform ourselves in the struggle against class enemies. We must, like Comrade Liu Yingjun, arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought. Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions to be good soldiers of Chairman Mao. We work, farm, and serve in the army not for money, but for the people, for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. Sun Yefang spreads the fallacy of the "contradiction between people and things," attempting to make us abandon self-reform. This is a futile attempt!

Sun Yefang! You say that in a socialist society, there are only "people and things" contradictions, and no class struggle. This is completely deceitful. You and your handful of black gangsters are waging the class struggle of the bourgeoisie. The workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought have the keenest sense of smell and the brightest eyes and will not fall into your trap.

### 绝不能只抓粮棉油，不分敌我友

    绝不能只抓粮棉油，不分敌我友
    沈阳部队后勤部　沈才
    什么是生产关系，毛主席早有明确的指示：“在各种阶级的社会中，各阶级的社会成员，则又以各种不同的方式，结成一定的生产关系，从事生产活动，以解决人类物质生活问题。”这就是说，生产关系就是在社会生产过程中人和人的关系。在有阶级的社会中，生产关系就是阶级关系。在社会主义社会里还存在着阶级，社会主义社会里的生产关系也是阶级之间的关系。
    孙冶方胡说“‘人’与‘物’的矛盾”是“社会主义经济的最深远的内在矛盾”；“一切经济问题”都是“人和物”的关系问题。照他看来，在社会主义建设中只有人和物的关系、人和物的矛盾，再没有什么阶级关系和阶级矛盾了；只要同天斗、同地斗，再不要同阶级敌人斗了；就可以埋头搞建设，只抓粮棉油，不要再分敌我友了。他的居心极为恶毒。他企图解除我们的思想武装，使我们失掉阶级警惕性，在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中打败仗。
    难道地、富、反、坏、右，跟我们劳动人民已经是一家人，可以“和平共处”了吗？不，绝不能这样。我们清楚地知道，被推翻的地主资产阶级，他们人还在，心不死，白天黑夜都做着复辟封建主义和资本主义的美梦。我们同他们之间分明存在着你死我活的阶级斗争，这算是哪种“人和物”的关系呢？
    我们在经济战线上，同“三自一包”的斗争，同贪污盗窃的斗争，同资本主义经营思想的斗争，等等，难道不是无产阶级同资产阶级、社会主义道路同资本主义道路之间的斗争，而是什么“人和物”的问题吗？
    就拿我们部队后勤财务工作来说吧，是贯彻艰苦奋斗、勤俭建军的精神，还是铺张浪费？是把经费重点用于建设，还是用于消费？是为广大指战员服务，还是搞少数人的特殊化？……这种种思想斗争，就是无产阶级和资产阶级、社会主义道路和资本主义道路的斗争在后勤财务工作中的反映。如果我们照孙冶方讲的去做，只抓人和物的矛盾，只去埋头管钱、管物，不抓两种思想的斗争，那我们就要成为没有政治头脑的糊涂人。我们绝不信他那一套，一定要狠抓兴无灭资的斗争，为实现部队的非常无产阶级化和非常革命化而斗争。
    从我们自身革命化来说也是一样。我们革命战士不是生活在真空里，也会受到社会上阶级斗争的影响，也会受到剥削阶级思想的影响。难道我们不需要进行自我改造，只顾埋头生产、埋头工作就行了吗？不，绝不能这样。毛主席教导我们，要在改造客观世界的同时改造主观世界，要在与阶级敌人斗争中改造自己。我们一定要像刘英俊同志那样，用毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑。读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。我们做工、种田、当兵，绝不是为了钞票，而是为了人民，为了中国革命和世界革命。孙冶方散布“人与物的矛盾”的谬论，妄图使我们放弃思想改造。这是痴心妄想！
    孙冶方！你说社会主义社会只有“人与物”的矛盾，没有阶级斗争，这完全是欺骗。你们一小撮黑帮搞的就是资产阶级的阶级斗争。用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵群众，嗅觉最灵，眼睛最亮，绝不上你的圈套。
