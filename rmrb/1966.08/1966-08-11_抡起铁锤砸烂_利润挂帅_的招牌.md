The counter-revolutionary and anti-socialist element Sun Yefang, under the banner of "Profit First," opposes the proletariat's political leadership and opposes Mao Zedong Thought taking the lead. He vigorously advocates for profit as the "central link that drives everything," and maliciously slanders us for "not considering costs and not talking about profits." This is all nonsense.

I am an old worker who started working in a factory for the capitalists at the age of twelve, experiencing the bitterness and hardship of the old society. At that time, capitalists ran enterprises solely for profit, ruthlessly exploiting the blood and sweat of the working people. For profit, the relationships between enterprises were deceitful, mutually exclusive, competitive, and exclusionary—"big fish eat small fish."

Our factories today are socialist enterprises, part of the entire national economy and socialist construction. We produce not for profit but to meet the needs of socialist construction and the revolution. Workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought have a broad vision for the country and the world. We not only strive to do our jobs well according to the spirit of the Party's general line for socialist construction but also regard the difficulties of sister factories as our own. We promote the spirit of great cooperation in communism to drive the development of social productive forces. This is the style of our socialist enterprises.

If Sun Yefang regards profit as the driving force of enterprise production, then an enterprise, in pursuit of profit, can abandon socialist principles, refuse mutual support among enterprises, and disregard technical cooperation. Enterprises can resort to any means for profit, mutually excluding each other. Isn't this a blatant attempt to drag us back?

Since 1958, I have participated in the technical cooperation activities of Harbin City. From the perspective of a single enterprise, profit indicators are not visible, but the "political indicators" we gain are immeasurable. In 1963, the Youlian Pen Factory had a friction press with insufficient sensitivity, causing poor quality and quantity of pen tips, severely affecting the completion of export tasks. In technical cooperation, we helped them repair this machine, solving this long-standing problem. We absolutely cannot, as Sun Yefang says, pursue "profit" one-sidedly and not help solve the difficulties of sister factories. We must oppose the purely economic viewpoint and firmly establish the proletariat's political viewpoint; we cannot just calculate economic accounts but must also consider the political accounts of the Chinese and world revolutions.

Sun Yefang advocates for "Profit First," which means he does not want us to revolutionize or fight against capitalist ideology. We firmly disagree. In 1962, the Harbin Electricity Bureau had an air compressor for automatic control switches imported from a revisionist country. As soon as it started, it overheated within twenty minutes, seriously affecting the city's power supply. There were more than ten such devices in Northeast China, all with this problem. Could we, because of "costs" and "profits," allow revisionists to laugh at us? Absolutely not! Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, my colleagues and I in the technical service team broke away from superstition, liberated our minds, and helped the Electricity Bureau dissect and study the machine, finally solving the root cause of the overheating. This not only achieved immeasurable economic results but, more importantly, won a great political victory, greatly boosting the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people and crushing the arrogance of revisionism. This gain cannot be measured by profit indicators.

Whether to use political leadership or "Profit First" is a major issue concerning whether we advance towards communism or retreat towards capitalism. I want to warn Sun Yefang: we, the workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have our hearts set on the Chinese and world revolutions. We firmly reject your revisionist "Profit First" nonsense. Our eyes are clear; whoever dares to oppose our socialist system, dare to oppose the great Party, dare to oppose the great Mao Zedong Thought, we will fight to the end. The working class will definitely use hammers to smash all ghosts and monsters, and we will not rest until we have completely crushed these counter-revolutionary and anti-socialist elements!

### 抡起铁锤砸烂“利润挂帅”的招牌

　　抡起铁锤砸烂“利润挂帅”的招牌
　　哈尔滨车辆厂工人工程师　苏广铭
    反党反社会主义分子孙冶方打着“利润挂帅”的招牌，反对无产阶级政治挂帅，反对毛泽东思想挂帅。他极力主张以利润作为“带动一切的中心环节”，还恶毒地污蔑我们“不计工本、不讲盈利”。这完全是胡说八道。
    我是个老工人，从十二岁就入工厂给资本家干活，尝尽了旧社会的辛酸苦辣。那时候，资本家办企业就是为了追求利润，就是为了残酷地榨取我们劳动人民身上的血汗。为了利润，企业之间的关系是尔虞我诈，互相封锁，互相竞争，互相排挤，“大鱼吃小鱼”。
    我们今天的工厂是社会主义企业，是整个国民经济的一部分，是社会主义建设的一部分。我们搞生产不是为了赚钱，而是为了满足社会主义建设事业的需要，是为了革命的需要。我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人，都是胸怀祖国、放眼世界的。我们不仅要按照党的社会主义建设总路线的精神，干好我们自己的工作，还要把兄弟工厂的困难看成是自己的困难，发扬共产主义大协作精神，促进社会生产力的大发展。这是我们社会主义企业的风格。
    孙冶方既然把利润看作企业生产的动力，那么，一个工厂为了追求利润，可以丢掉社会主义原则，可以不要企业之间的支援，不要互相之间的技术协作，企业之间为了利润可以不择手段，互相封锁。这不是明目张胆地要拉我们开倒车吗？
    我从一九五八年参加哈尔滨市的技术协作活动。从一个企业来看，利润指标是看不到的，但是我们得到的“政治指标”却是不可估量的。一九六三年，友联金笔厂有一台磨擦压力机，由于灵敏度不够，笔尖质量和数量老是上不去，严重影响了出口任务的完成。我们在技术协作中，帮助他们修复了这台机器，解决了这个老大难的关键。我们绝不能象孙冶方说的那样，片面地追求“利润”，对兄弟厂的困难不帮助解决。我们必须反对单纯经济观点，牢固地树立无产阶级的政治观点；不能单算经济账，更要算中国革命和世界革命的政治账。
    孙冶方主张“利润挂帅”，就是不要我们革命，不要我们同资本主义思想斗争，我们坚决不答应。一九六二年，哈尔滨电业局有一台由修正主义国家进口的控制自动开关的空气压缩机，一开车，工作不到二十分钟就发热，给全市供电带来了严重的影响。仅东北地区就有十几台这样的设备，都存在着这个问题。我们能因“工本”、“盈亏”而叫修正主义看我们的笑话吗？不能，绝对不能！我和技术服务团的同志，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，破除迷信，解放思想，帮助电业局把这台机器解剖研究，终于把发热的根本问题解决了。这不仅在经济上收到了不可计算的效果，更重要的是在政治上打了一个大胜仗，大长了中国人民的革命志气，大灭了修正主义的威风，这个收获是没法用利润指标来计算的。
    用政治挂帅还是用“利润挂帅”，这是关系到向共产主义前进还是向资本主义倒退的大问题。我要警告孙冶方，我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵群众，心里想的是中国革命、世界革命。我们坚决不要你那套“利润挂帅”的修正主义黑货。我们的眼睛是雪亮的，不管是谁，胆敢反对我们社会主义制度，胆敢反对伟大的党，胆敢反对伟大的毛泽东思想，我们就要坚决和他拚到底。我们工人阶级一定用铁锤砸碎一切牛鬼蛇神，不把你们这些反党反社会主义分子砸烂绝根，绝不罢休！
