Dear Comrades,

We gather here in Shanghai today to bid farewell to each other after our visit to the great socialist country of China. It is due to the genius of Comrade Mao Zedong, who has brilliantly developed Marxism-Leninism to a new stage, that the heroic Chinese people have built this great socialist China. Comrade Mao Zedong is a great theoretician, philosopher, poet, statesman, and military strategist.

First of all, on behalf of the revolutionary people of Congo (Leopoldville), I extend warm greetings to you and to the representatives from the Asian and African countries where the flames of anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist struggle are burning ever more fiercely. I congratulate you on your contribution to the success of this historic conference and on your choice of Beijing, the beautiful capital of Asian-African solidarity, as the venue for the Third Asian-African Writers' Conference.

At the same time, I wish to express our gratitude to the Chinese people and government for the hospitality extended to us during our stay in China. At this difficult moment when the demons of the world are trying to split our movement and hinder the progress of the peoples' wars in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, this hospitality has convinced us that the People's Republic of China is the sole hope for the oppressed, exploited, and plundered peoples. It has led us to the conclusion that the thoughts of Comrade Mao Zedong are not only the guarantee of the struggling peoples and the wealth of the whole world but also the compass guiding the world proletariat to victory in a just war.

Dear Comrades,

The success of our Asian-African Writers' Emergency Conference is a great victory for the peoples of the two continents. It is a great challenge to U.S. imperialism and its accomplices and a great support to the Vietnamese people in their anti-aggression struggle. It fully proves that the solidarity of Asia and Africa is indissoluble. Faced with the common threat of imperialism, the peoples of Asia and Africa have awakened, united, and continued their struggle against imperialism to become masters of their own destiny.

The success of this conference has further consolidated Asian-African solidarity, brought us closer to each other, and established fraternal feelings among us. The united front against imperialism and its accomplices in Asia and Africa has greatly expanded. Fifty-three countries and regions participated in the Beijing Conference, which has made U.S. imperialism tremble and see its failure approaching.

We have raised high the banner of struggle against U.S. imperialism, supported the armed struggle of the Vietnamese people, and adopted thirty-seven resolutions concerning some countries. The Vietnamese people and the peoples of other countries in their armed struggles have obtained the most resolute support from the world. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we shall advance from victory to victory.

The Vietnamese people, who are fighting with indomitable will and courage, will surely win; the Congolese (Leopoldville) people, who are fighting revolutionary violence against reactionary violence, will surely win; the Thai people, the people of North Kalimantan, the Angolan people, the Mozambican people, the Rwandan people, the Zimbabwean people, the Indonesian people, the Laotian people, and the Cambodian people will surely win; the Chinese people will surely plant the five-star red flag on Taiwan. The peoples of the world united in the anti-imperialist united front will surely win, and U.S. imperialism will surely be isolated and fail.

I want to tell my Chinese comrades that we are about to leave this beautiful country of China. After we return to Africa, we will recall how the Chinese people, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and the general line of the Communist Party, have achieved self-reliance and made great leaps forward in all fields. They have launched a thunderous offensive against the remnants of capitalism and feudalism on the political, economic, ideological, and cultural fronts. This shows us what a people can achieve when they can work freely with their own strength. All these achievements of the Chinese people are due to the creative genius of their leader, Mao Zedong, and the correct leadership of the Communist Party.

The socialist revolution in China must be carried forward continuously to sweep away all hidden counter-revolutionary elements. The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the victory of Marxism-Leninism principles, the victory of the world armed struggle, because if People's China were to turn to revisionism, the world revolution would suffer, and the oppressed peoples would lose their defender in their just struggle.

Long live Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live the armed struggle of the people!

Long live Asian-African solidarity!

    在上海欢送亚非作家代表的群众大会上
    刚果（利）代表团团长基布韦的讲话亲爱的同志们：
    我们在访问了伟大的社会主义中国之后，今天聚集在上海相互道别。由于有了出色地把马克思列宁主义推向一个崭新阶段的毛泽东同志——这个伟大的理论家、哲学家、诗人、政治家、军事家的天才，英雄的中国人民建设了这个伟大的社会主义中国。
    首先，我以刚果（利）革命人民的名义向你们，向来自反帝反殖革命斗争烈火越烧越旺的亚非各国的代表们致以热烈的祝贺，祝贺你们为这次历史性会议的成功所做出的贡献，并祝贺你们选择了北京这个亚非团结的美丽的首都作为举行第三届亚非革命作家大会的地点。
    同时我要感谢中国人民和中国政府在我们逗留中国期间所给予的款待。正当世界上的牛鬼蛇神竭力分裂我们的运动和阻止亚非拉人民战争的进程的这个困难时刻，这种款待使我们确信中华人民共和国是被压迫、被剥削、被掠夺人民的唯一希望。这种款待使我们得出这样的结论：毛泽东同志的思想不仅是斗争中的人民的保证和全世界的财富，而且也是指引世界无产阶级取得正义战争胜利的指南针。
    亲爱的同志们，
    我们亚非作家紧急会议的成功是我们两洲人民的伟大胜利，是对美帝及其同谋者的一个大挑战，是对进行反侵略斗争的越南人民的巨大支持，这也充分证明亚非的团结是不可分割的。由于有着共同敌人的威胁，亚非两洲已经觉醒，团结起来，共同继续向帝国主义进行斗争，争取成为自己命运的主人。
    这次会议的成功进一步巩固了亚非团结，使我们彼此更加接近了，并在我们之间建立起了兄弟般的感情。反对帝国主义及其同谋者的亚非统一战线大大扩大了。有五十三个国家和地区参加了北京会议，这使美帝国主义感到惊恐，也使他们看到他们的失败已经在望。
    我们高举反对美帝国主义的斗争旗帜，支持越南人民的武装斗争，并通过了关于一些国家的三十七个决议。越南人民和我们其他各国人民在武装斗争中得到全世界最坚决的支持。在毛泽东思想指引下，我们将从胜利走向胜利。
    以坚韧不拔的毅力和勇敢精神进行斗争的越南人民必胜；以革命的暴力反对反动的暴力的刚果（利）人民必胜；泰国人民，北加里曼丹人民，安哥拉人民，莫三鼻给人民，卢旺达人民，津巴布韦人民，印度尼西亚人民，老挝人民，柬埔寨人民必胜；中国人民必将把五星红旗插到台湾省。团结在反帝统一战线之内的全世界人民必胜，美帝国主义必将陷于孤立，遭到失败。
    我要告诉中国同志们，我们就要离开人民中国这个美丽的国家了；在我们回到非洲后，我们将回忆起中国人民在毛泽东思想照耀下，在共产党的总路线的指引下，自力更生，在一切战线上都实现了大跃进。他们在政治、经济、思想、文化战线上以雷霆万钧之势向资本主义和封建主义的残余发动了进攻。这向我们表明：当一个国家的人民能够依靠自己的力量自由地工作时，他们能做出什么样的事情。中国人民的这一切归功于他们的领袖毛泽东的创造性的天才和共产党的正确领导。
    中国的社会主义革命一定要不断深入下去，以便横扫一切暗藏的反革命坏分子。这场无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，就是马列主义原则的胜利，就是世界武装斗争的胜利，因为，如果人民中国竟然转向修正主义，世界革命就会遭殃，被压迫人民在他们的正义斗争中也就会失去保卫者。
    毛泽东思想万岁！
    人民的武装斗争万岁！
    亚非团结万岁！
