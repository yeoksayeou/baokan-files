Xinhua News Agency, August 31st: Thirty scientists from four continents attending the Beijing Physics Discussion Meeting spoke at the closing ceremony today, warmly congratulating the great achievements of this discussion meeting and celebrating the further consolidation and development of the fighting friendship between scientists and peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania.

The scientists pointed out that the awakened peoples and scientists of the four continents are determined and confident in breaking the monopoly and control of imperialism in the scientific field and mastering the most advanced science and technology. They also pointed out, based on the personal experiences of the peoples of various countries, that national independence and social reform are the prerequisites for establishing and developing national scientific undertakings.

The scientists warmly congratulated the great achievements of the Chinese people, led by the great leader Chairman Mao, in various construction undertakings. Some scientists pointed out that Chairman Mao Zedong's brilliant wisdom has had a magical effect on the Chinese people. This magical effect has turned into work ability, organizational ability, and practical ability. Some scientists said that Mao Zedong Thought is scientific thought, and the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought have rapidly achieved one victory after another.

Vietnamese scientist Wei Ruqun Song said in his speech that the success of this discussion meeting is the result of the unity and cooperation of scientists from the four continents. He said that the scientists of the four continents are closely united in the common struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism for national independence, peace, democracy, and social progress.

He said that the firm support of scientists from the four continents for the Vietnamese people's just struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation has contributed to further strengthening the fighting unity of scientists and peoples of the four continents in the common struggle against imperialism led by U.S. imperialism for national independence, peace, democracy, and social progress. On behalf of Vietnamese scientists and people from the front line of the struggle against U.S. imperialism, he expressed his highest respect and sincere thanks to the progressive scientists and peoples of various countries.

He finally congratulated the Chinese scientists and the great Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by the beloved Comrade Mao Zedong, on their ever more brilliant victories.

Uruguayan scientist Grunbone said in his speech that this physics discussion meeting has shown the possibilities and future prospects of scientific research and development in the countries of the four continents. He said that during this discussion meeting, we have seen that China has made astonishing progress not only in science and technology but also in all other fields.

Egyptian scientist Osman said in his speech that the nature of the participating countries of this discussion meeting has helped the success of the discussion meeting because the vast majority of the participating countries are newly emerging countries. Due to the exploitation of imperialism and the oppression of colonialism, these countries have many similar problems. The cooperation and exchange of experiences of newly emerging countries represent the hope of breaking the monopoly of science and achieving the true political and economic independence of these countries. He said that supporting the revolutionary forces of the world is supporting ourselves. We have the duty to always support all liberation movements in the world.

Tanzanian scientist Ntamila said in his speech that their delegation unreservedly condemns the imperialist countries led by the United States using scientific achievements as tools of oppression and aggression in Vietnam and other parts of the world. He also said that when there are still thousands of people in the world suffering from pain, hunger, and despair, scientists cannot and should not limit themselves to the realm of pure theory, and should not be detached from reality. Scientists should make meaningful contributions to eliminating social evils, promoting human progress, prosperity, and peace.

Syrian scientist Azam said in his speech that in a country, science in the hands of a few privileged classes will become a tool for this class to oppress and exploit the people. He said that the U.S. imperialists are currently using modern technology to cause the most serious destruction to the Vietnamese people who are fighting for liberation.

He said that the peace forces of the world must work together to free all our countries from imperialist interference in their internal affairs. He said that scientists should not allow their work results to be used for the service of warlike forces under any circumstances.

Sudanese scientist Hegazi said that this discussion meeting will help to develop the natural sciences of our countries and consolidate the friendship between scientists and peoples of the four continents. He said that we will bring the good feelings of the Chinese people to our people and convey the great achievements we have seen in China to our people.

Sierra Leonean scientist Jialuo said that we must not forget that in the process of our efforts to discover the truth and theory of science, we are also fighting against two enemies, imperialism and old and new colonialism. He emphasized that for world peace and security, the aggressive actions of the United States in Vietnam should be unequivocally condemned. He expressed his firm belief that the Vietnamese people will definitely win.

He called on scientists from all over the world to support the struggle of Vietnamese scientists and people against U.S. imperialist aggression.

Iraqi scientist Jita said in his speech that, in contrast to those who try to monopolize the practical principles of physics for their own interests, this discussion meeting has formulated the policy that physicists of the four continents should learn from each other and support each other to promote the development of physics. He warmly praised the astonishing achievements of the Chinese people in construction. He said that the most impressive thing he left during his short visit is that the secret of China's rapid progress lies in the whole country's united march towards a goal.

Indonesian scientist Suhariyo said that the peoples of the four continents fully understand that imperialism led by the United States is trying every means to occupy our territory, rule, and exploit our people. Facing this danger, we have fought resolutely. This is because without eliminating imperialism and eradicating its evil influence, we cannot achieve true and comprehensive national independence, which is an absolutely necessary condition for serving the people and developing national culture and science. Only when we achieve and maintain true national independence, eradicate the influence of imperialism, and eliminate the remnants of feudalism, can our culture and science develop healthily.

He pointed out that through this physics discussion meeting, we are more convinced that the peoples and progressive scientists of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania have great talent and can achieve great success in science.

Guinean scientist Saidou said in his speech that he was satisfied with the achievements reflected in the discussion meeting's communiqué and admired the unwavering will and spirit of self-reliance of the new China in its construction. He believed that the dialectical materialism of Marxism-Leninism, which conforms to the development of the world, will definitely defeat all idealist opportunism and blind philosophy.

He strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists' use of scientific achievements to blatantly violate the sovereignty of the Vietnamese people and firmly believed that the unity of the democratic forces of Vietnam would soon annihilate the U.S. imperialists who are in dire straits. He said that U.S. imperialism will fail in the face of the united progressive forces of the world, which are supported by the powerful ally of the People's Republic of China, guided by the ever-vigorous Mao Zedong Thought.

Ecuadorian scientist Romero said that in this discussion meeting, the large amount of knowledge contributed and received by the scientific delegations of various countries will further develop the physics of the participating countries. This discussion meeting has strengthened the brotherly relations of scientists from the four continents.

Congolese (Brazzaville) scientist Emmanuel emphasized that despite the rumors spread by imperialism, we believe that the countries of Africa, Asia, Oceania, and Latin America can obtain the most advanced knowledge and make it serve their people. To achieve this goal, we should first rely on our own strength.

He pointed out that the problem of scientific development of a society is inseparable from political problems. Therefore, scientists of the four continents should unite their strength to fight against imperialism. He said that U.S. imperialism, in order to destroy the people who are determined to defend their independence, freedom, and unity, uses scientific achievements to engage in cruel and shameless activities. This struggle concerns all of us, and we must unite to thoroughly defeat imperialism. He expressed his firm support for the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people and other peoples.

Colombian scientist Ganba said in his speech that through our personal experience, we have seen the current state of technological and cultural development of the Chinese people and personally witnessed the magical effect of Chairman Mao Zedong's brilliant wisdom on the Chinese people. This magical effect has turned into work ability, organizational ability, and practical ability. He shouted, "Long live New China!"

Chilean scientist Alvial said that the experience gained by Chilean scientists at the Beijing Physics Discussion Meeting and their understanding of the progress of Chinese science and technology have strengthened Chilean scientists' belief in maintaining and promoting cultural and scientific exchanges between Chile and China.

Sri Lankan scientist Kannangara said that the Sri Lankan delegation has learned a lot from the experience and exchange of opinions at this discussion meeting. He praised the astonishing achievements of the Chinese people in science and technology and wished the 1968 Beijing Science Discussion Meeting greater success.

Cambodian scientist Jichun pointed out that the high level of the papers presented at this discussion meeting proves that science is no longer monopolized by imperialist countries. The gathering of scientists from various countries has helped to strengthen the unity of the peoples of various countries in the anti-imperialist struggle.

He condemned the U.S. imperialists' use of scientific and technological achievements to threaten world peace. He pointed out that the U.S. imperialists' aggression against the Vietnamese people and their aggressive actions against Laos and Cambodia are all intolerable. We are resolutely fighting against U.S. imperialism. No matter how brutal U.S. imperialism is, no matter what tricks it plays, the peoples of Indochina and the peoples of the world will defeat U.S. imperialism together.

In his speech, he enthusiastically praised Mao Zedong Thought. He said that Chinese physicists have successfully applied Mao Zedong Thought, which plays a guiding role in their research and teaching work. Mao Zedong Thought is scientific thought, so Chinese physicists regard it as an effective means to solve modern physics. The Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought have rapidly achieved one victory after another. He said that the names of Dazhai people, Daqing people, and Cai Ziquan, among others, generally illustrate the power a country's people can exert through self-reliance. The Cambodian people and scientists are proud of China's achievements and are inspired by them.

Myanmar scientist U Jao Min said that the success of this discussion meeting is due to the efforts of all participants from the four continents. Holding such discussion meetings will not only promote the development of science but also strengthen friendly relations between all participating countries.

Australian scientist Roberts praised this discussion meeting for strengthening mutual understanding and connections between scientists from various countries. He said that we have deepened our understanding of China, especially for Australia, understanding China is particularly important.

Argentinean scientist said in his speech that during the short days of this discussion meeting, we felt that we were immersed in this new world of China, and this experience moved us deeply. We have felt what a socialist country in progress is like. He said that the great social changes in China are irreversible, and the only thing waiting for the imperialist aggressors in this country is the grave.

He condemned U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam and supported the Vietnamese people's just struggle. He said that we unequivocally condemn U.S. imperialists using science and technology to invade Vietnam, and we also condemn those scientists who take an indifferent attitude and directly or indirectly cooperate with the imperialist attack. He emphasized that as long as the common enemy of the peoples of the world is not defeated, all scientific, cultural, or economic activities will be in vain and difficult to use for the welfare of the people.

Algerian scientist Yusuf was satisfied with the fruitful cooperation of various delegations at this discussion meeting and hoped that everyone would gather again at the 1968 Beijing Science Discussion Meeting. He said that by then, there will be some representatives from countries liberated from colonial and imperialist control joining our ranks.

East African scientist Geishi pointed out that this physics discussion meeting has achieved brilliant results and carried forward the spirit of the 1964 Beijing Science Discussion Meeting. It shows that so-called "underdeveloped countries" are capable of achieving the highest scientific achievements. He warmly praised the astonishing achievements of China's scientific undertakings in a short period.

Afghan scientist Ebad said in his speech that he enthusiastically praised the progress of the Chinese people. He said that during his stay in Beijing, he saw that the Chinese people love labor very much, work with full confidence, and believe in their future. He believed that China would make greater progress and leave a deeper impression on the world.

    他在致词中热情地赞颂了毛泽东思想。他说，中国物理学家在研究和教学工作中成功地运用了起指导作用的毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想是科学的思想，所以中国物理学家把它看作解决现代物理的有效手段。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民飞速地取得了一个又一个的成就。他说，大寨人、大庆人、蔡祖泉等有威望的名字概括地说明了一个国家人民依靠自力更生所能发挥的威力。柬埔寨人民和科学家为中国的成就感到自豪，并从中受到鼓舞。
    缅甸科学家吴叫敏说，这次讨论会的成功应归功于四大洲所有与会者所作的努力。举行这种讨论会不仅会促进科学的发展，而且会加强所有与会国之间的友好关系。
    澳大利亚科学家罗伯茨赞扬这次讨论会加强了各国科学家的相互了解和相互联系。他说，我们特别对中国的了解加深了，对于澳大利亚来说，对中国的了解是特别重要的。
    阿根廷科学家致词说，在这次讨论会期间的短短几天中，我们感觉到自己沉浸在中国这个新世界之中，这种经历使我们很受感动。我们体会到了一个在前进中的社会主义国家是怎样的。他说，中国的巨大的社会变化是不可扭转的，在这个国家里等待着帝国主义侵略者的唯一的东西是坟墓。
    他谴责美帝国主义侵略越南，支持越南人民的正义斗争。他说，我们毫不犹豫地谴责美帝国主义者使用科学技术来进行对越南的侵略，同样，我们也谴责那些采取无动于衷的态度直接或间接地配合帝国主义进攻的科学家。他强调说，只要世界各国人民共同的敌人不被打倒，一切科学、文化或经济活动将会落空，而且很难用于人民的福利。
    阿尔及利亚科学家优素福对这次讨论会上各个代表团富有成效的合作表示满意，并且希望大家在一九六八年的北京科学讨论会上再次聚会。他说，到那时候，将会又有一些从殖民主义和帝国主义控制下解放出来的国家的代表来参加我们的队伍。
    东非科学院科学家盖希指出，这次物理讨论会取得了辉煌的成就，发扬了一九六四年北京科学讨论会的精神，它表明所谓“不发达国家”是有能力取得最高科学成就的。他热烈赞扬中国科学事业在短短的时期内所取得的惊人成就。
