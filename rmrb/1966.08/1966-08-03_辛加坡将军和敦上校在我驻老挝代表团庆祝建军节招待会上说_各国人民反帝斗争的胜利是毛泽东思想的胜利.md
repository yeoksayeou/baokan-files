The Chinese Economic and Cultural Mission to Laos held a reception on July 29 to celebrate the 39th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army of China.

General Singapore, representing the Supreme Command of the Lao People's Liberation Army, attended the reception and delivered a speech. He warmly praised the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which is guided by Mao Zedong Thought, as a great force in defending peace in Asia and the world.

Colonel Dun, Commander-in-Chief of the Lao Patriotic Neutralist Forces, and heads of various departments of the two patriotic forces, including Samane, Xipeng, and Colonel Tan, as well as heroes and models, were invited to attend the reception.

Representatives from the Vietnamese Democratic Republic's Economic and Cultural Mission to Laos were also invited to attend.

Zhang Jinlong, First Secretary of the Chinese Economic and Cultural Mission to Laos, spoke at the reception, introducing the glorious history of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which has grown stronger and more victorious under the guidance of Chairman Mao's military thought.

General Singapore then spoke. He emphasized that the Chinese People's Liberation Army's great victories are due to the political and military lines formulated by the Chinese Communist Party under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, with Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle. He said, "The Lao People's Liberation Army has learned valuable experiences from the Chinese People's Liberation Army in building armed forces and waging armed struggle, especially its resolute revolutionary spirit, long-term arduous struggle, and self-reliance."

He said, "The Lao People's Liberation Army, with a 21-year history of struggle, has fought bravely and achieved continuous victories, liberating two-thirds of the country. Our victories are inseparable from the support of the seven hundred million Chinese people led by Chairman Mao. No matter how long and difficult our revolutionary struggle may be, we have a great force by our side, which is the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the seven hundred million Chinese people. The most powerful force is the precious experience created by Mao Zedong—the people's war. We study Mao Zedong's works as textbooks because they embody the spirit of people's war in both political and military aspects."

He pointed out that the statement issued by Chairman Liu Shaoqi on behalf of the Chinese government and the seven hundred million Chinese people on July 22 dealt a heavy blow to the American imperialists who are intensifying their aggression against Vietnam and Laos.

Colonel Dun, in his speech, pointed out, "The Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, is not only the iron wall of socialist China but also the iron wall of the people of Indochina who are fighting to the death against the American aggressors and reactionaries. It is the vanguard of the strongest force in defending world peace. All the victories achieved on the battlefields against imperialism and old and new colonialism in the world today are the success and victory of Mao Zedong Thought. This is acknowledged by the people of the world who are fighting."

    辛加坡将军和敦上校在我驻老挝代表团庆祝建军节招待会上说
    各国人民反帝斗争的胜利是毛泽东思想的胜利
    据新华社康开二日电　中国驻老挝经济文化代表团在七月二十九日举行招待会，热烈庆祝中国人民解放军建军三十九周年。
    老挝人民解放军最高指挥部代表辛加坡将军出席了招待会，并且发表讲话，热情赞扬了以毛泽东思想为指导方向的中国人民解放军，是捍卫亚洲和世界和平的巨大力量。
    老挝爱国中立力量总指挥敦上校以及两支爱国力量各部门负责人沙曼、西喷、探上校等和英雄模范人物应邀出席了招待会。
    越南民主共和国驻老挝经济文化代表团的代表也应邀出席招待会。
    中国驻老挝经济文化代表团一等秘书张金龙在招待会上讲话，介绍了中国人民解放军遵循毛主席的建军思想，逐步发展壮大、英勇斗争、不断胜利的光荣历史。
    辛加坡将军接着讲话。他强调说：中国人民解放军之所以能取得伟大的胜利，“是因为以伟大领袖毛主席为首的中国共产党制定了以毛泽东思想为指针的政治路线和军事路线。我们老挝人民解放军学习了中国人民解放军建设武装力量和武装斗争的宝贵经验，特别是它坚决革命、长期艰苦奋斗、自力更生的革命精神。”
    他说：“具有二十一年斗争传统的老挝人民解放军，英勇斗争，不断胜利，解放了国土的三分之二。我们的胜利是同毛主席领导下的七亿中国人民的援助分不开的。不管我们的革命斗争要多么长时间，多么困难，但是我们身边有巨大的力量，这就是中国人民解放军，七亿中国人民。其中最有力量的是毛泽东创造的宝贵经验——人民战争。我们把毛泽东的著作当作教材，因为他的著作在政治和军事方面体现了人民战争的精神。”
    他指出，中华人民共和国主席刘少奇代表中国政府和七亿中国人民在七月二十二日发表的声明，给了正在加紧侵略越南和老挝的美帝国主义沉重的当头一棒。
    敦上校在讲话中指出：“用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民解放军不仅是社会主义中国的钢铁长城，而且是正在同美国侵略者和反动派进行你死我活斗争的印度支那人民的钢铁长城，是保卫世界和平最坚强的先锋队。当前世界上反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的各个战场上不断取得的一切胜利，是毛泽东思想的成功和胜利，这是世界上正在进行斗争的人民所一致承认的。”
