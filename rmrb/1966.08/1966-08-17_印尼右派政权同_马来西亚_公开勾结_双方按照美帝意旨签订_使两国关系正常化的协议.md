The Indonesian right-wing regime and the new colonialist product "Malaysia" regime signed an agreement on August 11 in Jakarta to "normalize relations between the two countries," openly colluding according to the dictates of American and British imperialism.

The agreement states that both sides agree to "immediately cease hostile actions between the two countries" and "immediately establish diplomatic relations and quickly exchange diplomatic representatives."

The agreement was signed by Adam Malik, the main political minister and foreign minister of the Indonesian right-wing military regime, and Tun Abdul Razak, the deputy prime minister and defense minister of "Malaysia." According to reports, Malik boasted in his speech at the signing ceremony that the signing of this agreement marks a new chapter in bilateral relations and is the starting point for "cooperation between the two sides." Razak declared in his speech that "Malaysia" has no more doubts about Indonesia and that "Malaysia" hopes for a "strong" Indonesia to exist, "to prevent rebellious elements from threatening Southeast Asia."

The signing of this agreement has realized the long-term plot of American and British imperialism to make the Indonesian right-wing forces and "Malaysia" openly declare their collusion. On the day of the signing, U.S. State Department spokesman Robert J. McCloskey issued a statement saying that the United States is "pleased" with the signing of such an agreement and "wishes it the best." The British Foreign Office also issued a statement on the same day, expressing "unreserved" welcome for the "end of confrontation" agreement signed in Jakarta, and specially sent a telegram to the Indonesian right-wing military regime expressing "sincere hope" that "traditional friendship between the two countries can now be restored and strengthened."

　　印尼右派政权同“马来西亚”公开勾结
    双方按照美帝意旨签订“使两国关系正常化的协议”
    新华社十二日讯  雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派军人政权和新殖民主义的产物“马来西亚”政权十一日在雅加达签订了一项“使两国关系正常化的协议”，按照美英帝国主义的意旨，公开勾结。
    这个协议宣布，双方同意“立刻停止两国间的敌对行动”；“立即建立两国之间的外交关系，并尽速互派外交代表”。
    在这个协议上签字的是印度尼西亚右派军人政权负责政治事务的主要部长兼外交部长马利克和“马来西亚”副总理兼国防部长阿扎克。据报道，马利克在签字仪式上讲话，吹嘘这个协议的签订为双方关系揭开了新的一页，是双方“携手合作的起点”。阿扎克在讲话中宣称，“马来西亚”对印度尼西亚不再有任何怀疑，“马来西亚”非常希望有一个“强大的”印度尼西亚存在，“以防止叛变分子对东南亚的威胁”。
    这个协议的签订，实现了美、英帝国主义长期策划的使印度尼西亚右派势力同“马来西亚”公开宣布勾结的阴谋。美国国务院发言人赖特在签字当天发表声明说，美国对签订这样一个协议“表示高兴”，并“表示最好的祝愿”。英国外交部在当天也发表一项声明表示“无保留地”欢迎在雅加达签订的这个“结束对抗的协议”，并且专门打电报给印度尼西亚右派军人政权表示“殷切希望”英国同印度尼西亚“两国之间的传统友谊现在得以恢复和加强”。
