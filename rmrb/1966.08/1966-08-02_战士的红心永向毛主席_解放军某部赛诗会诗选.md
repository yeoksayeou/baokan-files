We, these children who suffered in the old society and now hold guns in the new society, have boundless love for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. We have so much to say to our great Party and Chairman Mao. Our company's Youth League branch and Revolutionary Soldiers' Committee organized a "Poetry Competition Evening." At this evening, comrades' eyes were filled with tears of excitement, and they eagerly sang out song after song from the bottom of their hearts.

The poetry competition began, and Zhang Xizhi, a member of the Revolutionary Soldiers' Committee who hosted the evening, sang the first song: The sunshine is bright and shines on us, our hearts are warm and our faces smile; we praise the Party and Chairman Mao, and we express our hearts through this poetry competition.

Youth League member Chen Yibin followed: I am a bitter gourd grown on a bitter vine, with roots in the southern valley. Three mountains pressed down on my head, and the vine was pressed to the bottom of the mountain. Generation after generation, the gourds were bitter, and our ancestors struggled in bitterness. The Communist Party led us to move the mountains, and Chairman Mao irrigated us. The withered vine sprouted new leaves, and branches and leaves flourished with new flowers. For thousands of years, the gourds will be sweet, and the flowers will never wither. The gourds are connected to the vine, and the vine to the roots. On one vine, there are ten thousand hearts, singing together with one voice: "The East is Red, the sun rises, Chairman Mao is our guide."

Each person has a history of blood and tears in their heart, and also a thousand songs of happiness.

Bugler Wang Wenyi sang: Where does the flower of happiness come from? It is entirely thanks to the Party planting it. Dew and rain make the flowers redder, and each flower blooms towards the sun. We will always follow the Party, and no matter how big the waves are, our feet will not sway.

New soldier Man Xiaoshan, who started learning culture after enlisting, eagerly sang: I was born in bitter water and grew up under the red flag, never leaving "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," always studying it. The path Chairman Mao points out, I stride forward; I dare to brave the storms and tread on the rapids. If the reactionaries cause trouble, I will resolutely smash them!

Company Commander Ye Yita sang: Workers, peasants, and soldiers, our power is great, we stand tall and hold the world. We closely follow Chairman Mao, and trample on ghosts and snakes under our feet. We fear neither stormy waves nor the splitting of heaven and earth.

Model soldier Guo Zhenqing looked at the portrait of Chairman Mao on the wall of the club and sang with deep emotion: Looking up and seeing Chairman Mao's portrait, my heart is clear and my eyes are bright. Chairman Mao's words are remembered in my heart, and my revolutionary spirit is high. I trample on a thousand difficulties, and I dare to face fire and mountains. Looking up and seeing Chairman Mao's portrait, I firmly hold the pen and the gun. Aiming the gun at the American wolves, I fiercely strike the reactionary clique. With a strong will and a red heart, I ride the winds and waves with high spirits.

Model soldier Chen Daxin sang: With both hands, I hold the quotation board, and Chairman Mao's words warm my heart. I remember every word and sentence, and I always have one heart with the Party.

At this time, everyone raised their hands to request to go on stage to sing poetry, and the entire venue was in a heated atmosphere, reaching the climax of the poetry competition.

Deputy Political Instructor Liu Xingxiang sang: Flowers bloom with the sun, seedlings grow with rain, revolutionary soldiers with Mao Zedong Thought, their hearts are clear and they never lose direction. The red hearts of revolutionary soldiers are completely and thoroughly for the people, forever following Chairman Mao, marching forward with heads held high.

Platoon Leader Zhang Hongzhen sang: Sunflowers face the sun, Chairman Mao's soldiers have red hearts for the Party. For the revolution, what fear is there of a thousand hardships! For the revolution, we are not afraid of wind and waves! Fish need water, gourds need vines, all things grow with the sun. Revolutionary soldiers do the revolution, all relying on Mao Zedong Thought.

Before the song was finished, many people suddenly stood up in the venue. But at this moment, the lights went out. Zhang Xizhi asked everyone to sit down, and he sang: The bitterness and sweetness in our hearts cannot be sung in three days and three nights. Songs of praise move people's hearts, crossing mountains and rivers to Beijing. The sound of songs and cheers is high, everyone stands up to shout slogans!

The majestic sound of slogans was like thunder in the spring sky: Hold high the revolutionary banner! Forever walk the revolutionary path! Forever follow the Communist Party! Forever follow Chairman Mao!

    战士的红心永向毛主席
    ——解放军某部赛诗会诗选
    战士  郭振清　韩凤岐张锡祉　高炳阳整理
    我们这些旧社会受苦的孩子、新社会握枪的战士，无限热爱共产党，无限热爱毛主席，我们有许多话要向我们伟大的党和毛主席倾诉。我们连的团支部和革命军人委员会举办了一个“赛诗晚会”。在这个晚会上，同志们眼眶里含着激奋的泪花，争先恐后地唱出了一首首心底的歌。
    赛诗会开始，主持晚会的革命军人委员会委员张锡祉唱出了第一首歌：阳光灿烂把咱照，心里温暖脸上笑；歌颂党和毛主席，咱们赛诗把心意表。
    共青团员陈贻炳接唱：俺是苦藤结的瓜，老根生在南山洼。三座大山顶头盖，瓜藤压在山底下。世世代代瓜儿苦，祖祖辈辈苦挣扎。共产党领咱把山搬，毛主席把咱来灌溉。枯藤长叶新芽绿，枝繁叶茂新花开。千年万载瓜儿甜，万载千年花不败。瓜儿连藤藤连根，一条藤上万颗心，放开嗓门同声唱，万人合唱一个音：东方红，太阳升，毛主席是咱引路人。
    每个人心上都有一部血泪史，也有千首幸福歌。
    司号员王文义唱：幸福花儿从哪来？全靠党来一手栽。雨露滋润花更红，朵朵花儿向阳开。咱们永远跟着党，风浪再大脚不歪。
    入伍后才开始学文化的新战士满孝山抢着唱：我生在苦水里，长在红旗下，“毛选”不离手，时时学习它。毛主席指的路，我大步往前跨；风浪我敢闯，险滩我敢踏。黑帮要捣乱，坚决打垮他！
    连长叶义太唱：工农兵，力量大，顶天立地掌天下。紧紧跟着毛主席，牛鬼蛇神脚下踏。惊涛骇浪无所惧，天开地裂也不怕。
    五好战士郭振清望着俱乐部墙上的毛主席象，深情地唱：抬头望见毛主席象，心也明来眼也亮。毛主席的话儿记在心，革命干劲高万丈。千重困难脚下踩，火海刀山也敢上。抬头望见毛主席象，手中紧握笔和枪。端枪对准美国狼，挥笔狠击狗黑帮。钢骨红心脚跟稳，乘风破浪斗志昂。
    五好战士陈大新唱：双手捧起语录板，毛主席的话儿暖心坎。字字句句牢记住，永远和党一个心眼。
    这时，大家纷纷举手要求上台唱诗，整个会场气氛热烈，赛诗会达到了高潮。
    副指导员刘兴祥唱：鲜花有了太阳才开放，禾苗有了雨水才茁壮，革命战士有了毛泽东思想，心明眼亮永不迷失方向。革命战士红色的心，完全彻底为人民，永远跟着毛主席，昂首阔步向前进。
    排长张洪振唱：葵花向阳，毛主席的战士，红心向党。为革命何惧千般苦！为革命不怕风和浪！鱼靠水，瓜连秧，万物生长靠太阳。人民战士干革命，全靠毛泽东思想。
    没等唱完，会场上又忽拉一下站起了许多人。可是，这时熄灯号响了。张锡祉同志要大家坐下，他唱道：咱们心中的苦和甜，三天三夜唱不完。赞歌声声动人心，越过山川进北京。歌声阵阵欢声高，大家起来呼口号！
    雄壮的口号声，就象是春雷当空：高举革命旗！永走革命路！永远跟着共产党！永远跟着毛主席！
