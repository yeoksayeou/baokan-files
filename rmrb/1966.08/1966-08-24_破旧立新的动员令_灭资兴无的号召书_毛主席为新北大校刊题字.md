The call to destroy the old and establish the new, to eliminate the bourgeoisie and promote the proletariat. Chairman Mao pens the title for the new Peking University journal.

	On August 23, the New China News Agency reported that our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao recently personally inscribed the characters "New Peking University" for the new journal of Peking University. On August 22, when the inaugural issue of the new journal with these three bold and vigorous red characters was published, the entire school's revolutionary teachers, students, and staff were greatly inspired and held a grand celebration.

	Revolutionary teachers and students, like celebrating a festival, carried portraits of Chairman Mao, held wreaths and large banners, and gathered at the venue to welcome the birth of the new journal. When they saw with their own eyes the three large characters written by their beloved leader Chairman Mao and held the new journal with Chairman Mao's portrait and these three characters, they were extremely excited. The entire venue resounded with drums and gongs, and everyone was joyful and exuberant, shouting for a long time: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" They also spontaneously sang revolutionary songs such as "The Ship Sails on Because It Has a Helmsman," and the songs and slogans echoed throughout the venue.

	Many revolutionary teachers and students gave passionate speeches at the meeting. They said, Chairman Mao personally inscribed the title for the "New Peking University" journal, which is a great honor for all revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Peking University, and it is the greatest care and encouragement for all revolutionary teachers, students, and staff. The old journal "Peking University" was a tool used by the counter-revolutionary clique of Lu Ping, Peng Peiyun, and others to carry out the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the former Beijing Municipal Committee, committing heinous crimes against the Party and the people. Today, under the personal leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has given new life to Peking University, and the school journal has also been reborn. We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, making the "New Peking University" a revolutionary journal that propagates and defends Mao Zedong Thought.

	The inaugural editorial of "New Peking University" states: "New Peking University" was born in the storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is a new victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought at Peking University and a new victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution at Peking University. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all work of the entire Party and the nation, and it is the guide for running "New Peking University." We must make "New Peking University" a red bastion for propagating and defending Mao Zedong Thought, a red bastion for propagating and implementing the Party's policies, and a red bastion for eliminating the bourgeoisie and promoting the proletariat. "New Peking University" must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement the spirit of the "Sixteen Points" decision and the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session, and play its due fighting role in the great torrent of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	The inaugural issue of "New Peking University" also published many articles written by revolutionary teachers and students to celebrate Chairman Mao's inscription for the new journal. They wrote:

	"Chairman Mao's inscription is a call to arms and a proclamation. It calls on us to smash the old Peking University and create a new Peking University. We resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, forge ahead through thorns and thistles, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, taking the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University as an example, and build a thriving socialist new Peking University."

	"Chairman Mao, you are our most brilliant helmsman, the supreme commander of the nation. In the days of gunfire and smoke, you wrote four volumes of heroic prose with your pen, guiding the Chinese people across mountains and rivers, welcoming the birth of New China; at every critical moment of the socialist revolution, you issued battle calls with your pen, leading hundreds of millions of people to overcome countless difficulties and forge ahead bravely! Today, you again, with a pen full of proletarian revolutionary passion, inscribed the title for our new journal in your busy schedule, giving us great inspiration and boundless strength. Your vigorous and powerful penmanship makes us forever spirited and full of fighting spirit. It inspires us to revolution forever and move forward forever, burying the old world and creating a new world!"

	On August 17, 1966, Chairman Mao inscribed the title for the new journal of Peking University.

	On August 22, when the inaugural issue of the new journal of Peking University, with the three bright red characters "New Peking University" inscribed by Chairman Mao, was published, the entire school's revolutionary teachers and students held a grand celebration. They shouted excitedly at the meeting: "Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

	Students of Peking University read the new journal "New Peking University" with great excitement.

    新华社二十三日讯　我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席，最近亲笔为北京大学新校刊题了“新北大”三个字。二十二日，当印有这三个刚劲雄浑的红色大字的新校刊创刊号发行的时候，全校革命师生员工万分鼓舞，他们为此举行了隆重的庆祝大会。
    革命师生们像庆贺节日那样，高举毛主席像，拿着花环和巨幅标语来到会场，迎接新校刊的诞生。当他们亲眼见到敬爱的领袖毛主席写的这三个大字，拿到印有毛主席像和这三个大字的新校刊时，兴奋极了，全场锣鼓齐鸣，个个欢腾雀跃，长时间地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”并且情不自禁地唱起《大海航行靠舵手》等革命歌曲，歌声、口号声响彻全场。
    许多革命师生在会上发表了热情洋溢的讲话。他们说，毛主席亲手为《新北大》校刊题字，这是北京大学全体革命师生员工的光荣，是对全体革命师生员工的最大关怀和鼓舞。旧校刊《北京大学》是陆平、彭珮云等反党反社会主义的黑帮贯彻前北京市委反革命修正主义路线的工具，对党和人民犯下了滔天的罪行。今天，我们伟大的领袖毛主席亲自领导的无产阶级文化大革命，使北大新生了，北大的校刊也新生了。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把《新北大》办成宣传和捍卫毛泽东思想的革命刊物。
    《新北大》的发刊词说，《新北大》在无产阶级文化大革命的暴风雨中诞生，这是伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想在北大的一个新胜利，是北大无产阶级文化大革命的一个新胜利。伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想是我们全党全国一切工作的指导方针，是办好《新北大》的指南。一定要把《新北大》办成宣传、捍卫毛泽东思想的红色阵地，办成宣传、贯彻党的方针政策的红色阵地，办成兴无灭资的红色阵地。《新北大》必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻执行“十六条”决定和十一中全会公报的精神，在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命的洪流中，发挥它应有的战斗作用。
    《新北大》创刊号还登载了许多革命师生为欢呼伟大领袖毛主席给新校刊题字而写的稿件。他们写道：
    “毛主席的题字是动员令、号召书。它号召我们砸碎旧北大，创造新北大。我们坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，披荆斩棘，勇往直前，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，以‘抗大’为榜样，建设一个欣欣向荣的社会主义新北大。”
      “毛主席啊，你是我们最英明的舵手，是全国人民的最高统帅，在那炮火纷飞的年代，你用笔写下雄文四卷，引导中国人民跨过千山万水，迎来了新中国的诞生；在社会主义革命的每一个关键时刻，你用笔发出战斗的号召，领导亿万群众，排除万难，奋勇前进！今天，你又用饱蘸着无产阶级革命豪情的大笔，在百忙中为我们新校刊题了字，给了我们巨大的鼓舞和无穷的力量。你那苍劲有力的笔迹，使我们永远精神振奋，斗志昂扬，它激励我们永远革命，永远向前，埋葬旧世界，创造新世界！”（附图片）
