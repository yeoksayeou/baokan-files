Chairman Mao, You Are the Unsetting Sun in the Hearts of the People of the World! – A Record of Scientists from Four Continents Meeting with the Great Leader Chairman Mao

“Chairman Mao has arrived! Chairman Mao has arrived!”

Scientists from more than thirty countries across four continents have, ever since they set foot on Chinese soil, expressed their most fervent and urgent wish to see the great leader Chairman Mao in the center of the world revolution. Now, this most blessed moment has finally arrived!

It was late in the evening of July 31, 1966, around ten o'clock, when Chairman Mao received the foreign scientists participating in the Beijing Physics Symposium.

The Peak of Joy and Happiness

The reception hall was brightly lit. Chairman Mao walked steadily towards the crowd, occasionally raising his arm to wave and greet the foreign friends.

Seeing the great leader they had longed to meet for so long, seeing the great revolutionary leader admired by the world, people were so moved that they didn't know how to express their feelings. They stared intently at Chairman Mao's tall figure and benevolent face, wanting to imprint this moment forever in their minds. One scientist later told a Chinese friend that at that moment, his excited heart seemed ready to jump out of his chest.

“Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!” In an instant, the entire hall erupted. People of different skin colors and nationalities, speaking various languages, expressed the same heartfelt cry from the bottom of their hearts. The foreign scientists shouted and clapped enthusiastically, some even clapped until their palms turned red.

After taking a group photo with the foreign scientists, Chairman Mao left the hall. The foreign scientists rushed towards Chairman Mao, continuously shouting, “Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!” They wished the great leader eternal life!

Chairman Mao left, but the foreign friends remained in the hall for a long time, reminiscing about the moment when Chairman Mao received them.

Here, the foreign scientists laughed heartily and shook hands in celebration.

Here, many people touched the chair where Chairman Mao had just sat during the group photo, recalling that most blessed moment. Many people found the spot where they had stood when shaking hands with Chairman Mao and took photos to commemorate it.

The night was deep, but everyone was reluctant to leave.

Iraq's scientist Ibrahim Nasir, who had traveled over thousands of mountains and rivers to Beijing, was so excited that he couldn't contain himself. He paced back and forth in the spacious hall and said, “I won't go back tonight, I want to stay here!”

Cambodian scientist Chi Chun, who sat very close to Chairman Mao during the group photo, felt “endless happiness” and “unparalleled glory.” He said, “We are very proud to have China as such a great friend.”

Japanese scientists, who had overcome numerous obstacles to come to Beijing after fighting against the reactionary forces of the United States and Japan, also shared their feelings with Chinese friends. The leader of the Japanese scientists, Yoshiki Yoshimi, said, “On the day of the reception, I was able to sit next to Chairman Mao Zedong, the great thinker and outstanding leader of the Chinese people. This is a precious moment in my life that I will never forget.”

Sudanese scientist Amin said well: Tonight is the climax of the Beijing Physics Symposium.

This is the peak of joy! This is the peak of happiness!

Indeed, how could one not be joyful, how could one not feel happy? “This is a meeting with the great leader of the Chinese people, with the great leader, teacher, and standard-bearer of the revolutionary people of the world!”

On the way back to the hotel by car, and in the quiet of the night after returning to the hotel, many people still talked to Chinese friends, discussing among themselves. Some people spent a sleepless night in boundless excitement and agitation.

Iraqi scientist Jita, who had said upon arriving in China, “If I don't see Chairman Mao this time, I won't go back!” Now, he had finally seen Chairman Mao. He was so excited! He later told others that during the reception, his heart couldn't calm down for a second, and he was so excited that his clothes were soaked with sweat. With boundless affection, he told Chinese friends, “Chairman Mao belongs not only to you but also to us, to the people of the world. He not only advances with the Chinese people but also with us. You should be proud of him! He is the greatest person!”

Sierra Leonean scientist Jialuo, when shaking hands with Chairman Mao, couldn't help but shout in the Chinese he had just learned, “Long live Mao Zedong!”

Ecuadorian scientist Baragan Romero, during the reception, was so moved that he shed tears. On the way back to the hotel by car, he was still crying. Along the way, he and another Ecuadorian scientist, Gustavo Moncayo, who was over sixty years old, repeatedly asked the Chinese interpreter to teach them how to shout “Long live Chairman Mao” in Chinese, practicing it over and over again. After returning to the hotel, Gustavo Moncayo told everyone, “Chairman Mao shook hands with me, I am truly happy, truly honored!”

“I am truly happy, truly honored!” This is the shared voice of friends from four continents. They said they would take this most beautiful and happy memory back to their countries, sharing it with their families, friends, and everyone they know, letting them also share in their happiness and glory.

Japanese scientists Kawashima Shuzo, Yokoi Yosuke, and Sri Lankan scientist Kannangara, after the reception with Chairman Mao, eagerly ran to the Chinese interpreters to shake hands tightly, saying, “This is the hand that Chairman Mao shook with us, come and share some happiness!” Kannangara also said, “Without Chairman Mao Zedong, this great man, China would not have today!” Argentine scientists expressed their excitement to others, saying that because Chairman Mao had shaken hands with them, they almost didn't want to wash their hands again. They said, “With the great thought of Mao Zedong, there are today's great achievements of China.”

Chairman Mao's Health is the Happiness of the People of the World

A few days before Chairman Mao's reception, when the foreign scientists learned of the news that Chairman Mao had swum in the Yangtze River, they eagerly spread the word and found newspapers to see Chairman Mao's radiant appearance, drawing endless inspiration from it. Today, when they saw with their own eyes that Chairman Mao was so healthy, how could they not be happy, how could they not feel boundless happiness! Scientists from four continents said: Chairman Mao's health is not only the happiness of the Chinese people but also the happiness of the people of the world!

Indonesian scientist Suhariyo, Burmese scientist Wu Jiao Min, and scientists from Japan, Cambodia, Congo (Brazzaville), and many other countries, immediately after the reception with Chairman Mao, eagerly told others: Chairman Mao was radiant, full of vigor, full of energy, and in excellent health! Ecuadorian scientist Romero, moved, held the hands of Chinese friends, tears welling up in his eyes, saying, “Excellent, excellent! Chairman Mao is extremely, extremely healthy!” Guinean scientist Saidu said, “Chairman Mao's health is the happiness of the people of the world. When Chairman Mao appeared, our hearts were infinitely moved, and the entire hall erupted!”

Scientists from Uruguay, Uganda, Morocco, and other countries, after seeing Chairman Mao with their own eyes, did not believe that Chairman Mao was already over seventy years old, saying he looked like someone in their fifties or sixties. Chilean scientist Martinoya even sighed in admiration, saying, “Chairman Mao experienced the Long March of twenty-five thousand li, experienced countless hardships, and today still has to consider the affairs of the world. He is still so healthy, truly amazing!”

Colombian scientist Mrs. Gamba repeatedly pointed out that Chairman Mao's health is the happiness of the people of the world. She also told Chinese friends that she would not only convey her personal observations to every person who loves Chairman Mao but also write articles to refute the lies spread by imperialism in the Western world.

Chairman Mao is the Greatest Giant in Human History

Some of the scientists from four continents who came to participate in the Beijing Physics Symposium had read Chairman Mao's books before coming to Beijing and gained enlightenment and strength from them. After coming to Beijing this time, some people, as soon as they got off the plane, asked Chinese staff to place a set of “Selected Works of Mao Zedong” in their room. Some people bought “Selected Works of Mao Zedong” themselves. Some people used the early morning and evening rest time during the more than ten days to read the first volume of “Selected Works of Mao Zedong.” Some people repeatedly praised the great thought of Mao Zedong during the meeting and the visit, praising the great achievements of the Chinese people under the guidance of Mao Zedong thought. Chairman Mao personally received the foreign scientists, which they regarded as a great force to inspire their advance.

On the night of Chairman Mao's reception, Colombian scientist Gamba carried “On Practice” by Chairman Mao with him. After the reception, he took it out to read. Mrs. Gamba said that Chairman Mao's guiding theory of revolution will not only play a great role in this century but also for thousands of years to come. Sierra Leonean scientist Jialuo mentioned that in the future, when reading Chairman Mao's works, he would think of the scene of Chairman Mao's reception this time, feeling more intimate and adding boundless strength. Some scientists said they would definitely promote the great achievements of China's revolution and construction and promote Mao Zedong thought after returning to their countries.

Three scientists from Cambodia, Algeria, and Chile, after the reception with Chairman Mao, enthusiastically said some words that might represent the boundless respect of scientists from four continents for Chairman Mao.

Cambodian scientist Tuolui said, “Chairman Mao Zedong is a great figure, a great genius. No genius in history can compare with him. The great thought of Mao Zedong will always play a role at any time.”

Algerian scientist Youssef said, “Chairman Mao is the greatest giant in human history, a great laborer and revolutionary who has experienced the Long March. A country's leader can gain the complete trust and boundless love of seven hundred million people, his thought can be accepted by seven hundred million people, and achieve brilliant results in various fields, this is rare in human history.”

To Be Forever Remembered

Chilean scientist Danilo Villarroel said, “Now, revolutionaries all over the world yearn for Chairman Mao, yearn for the Communist Party of China, yearn for the great Chinese people. Chairman Mao's works have become a beacon for the world's revolutionary people. If the people of the world all follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, then undoubtedly, the world revolution will make great strides forward. I have the highest faith in Chairman Mao, because Chairman Mao has developed Marxism-Leninism in politics, military, and other aspects, making outstanding contributions to the world people's revolution. Chairman Mao's point that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers is the most correct strategic and tactical viewpoint. The revolutionary people of the world need a genius creative Marxist like Chairman Mao.”

This happy meeting will forever be remembered by the scientists. Scientists recorded the moment of meeting with Chairman Mao in their notebooks with the most beautiful language:

“This is the highest honor of my life!” said a scientist from an Arab country.

“This is the greatest honor of my life!” said Burmese scientist Wu Dalai.

“This is the most precious moment, the peak of happiness!” said Moroccan scientist Wazani.

These excited feelings expressed in the languages of different countries reflect the same voice of scientists from four continents and also the voice of revolutionary people all over the world: “Chairman Mao, you are the unsetting sun in our hearts!”

    毛主席啊，您是全世界人民心中不落的太阳！
    ——记四大洲各国科学家会见伟大领袖毛主席
    “毛主席来了，毛主席来了！”
    来自四大洲三十多个国家的科学家们，许多人从踏上中国国土的那一天开始，便提出了一个最热烈最迫切的愿望，希望能够在世界革命的中心见到伟大的领袖毛主席。现在，这个最幸福的时刻终于来到了！
    这是一九六六年七月三十一日晚间十点多钟，毛主席接见了参加北京物理讨论会的各国科学家们。
    欢乐的最高潮　幸福的最高潮
    接见大厅里，灯光齐明。毛主席迈着稳健的步伐，缓缓地朝着大家走来，不时抬起手臂向各国朋友们挥手致意。
    见到了久已渴望见到的伟大领袖，见到了举世仰慕的伟大革命家，人们激动得一时不知道该怎样来表达自己的心情。他们目不转睛，凝视着毛主席高大的身躯和他那慈祥的面容，要把这时见到的一切都永远永远地刻印在脑海里。有的科学家事后告诉中国朋友说，当时，他一颗激动的心几乎都要跳出来了。
      “毛主席万岁！万万岁！”顷刻之间，整个大厅沸腾起来了。肤色不同、国籍不同的各国朋友们，操着各种语言，怀着最诚挚的感情，从内心里发出了同一个欢呼声。各国科学家们一面欢呼，一面热烈鼓掌，有些人把手掌心都拍红了。
    毛主席同各国科学家们合影后离开大厅的时候，各国科学家们又涌向毛主席，不断地欢呼“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”祝愿伟大领袖万寿无疆！
    毛主席离开了，各国朋友们依然留在大厅里，很久很久地回忆着毛主席接见他们的情景。
    在这里，各国科学家们放声欢笑，兴奋地互相握手庆贺。
    在这里，许多人抚摸着毛主席同大家合影时刚刚坐过的椅子，追忆那最幸福的时刻。许多人找到毛主席同他握手时自己站过的那块地方，争相摄影留念。
    夜已渐深，大家还久久地不愿离去。
    越过千山万水来到北京的伊拉克科学家易卜拉欣·纳西尔，这时是激动得如此地难以抑制。他在宽敞的大厅里不停地来回走动，并且说：“我今天不回去了，我要留在这里了！”
    来自我们友好邻邦的柬埔寨科学家吉春，在毛主席同各国科学家合影时，坐得离毛主席很近，他因此而感到“无限幸福”和“无尚光荣”。他说：我们为有中国这样伟大的朋友而感到非常骄傲。
    经过同美日反动派作了种种斗争，克服了重重障碍，然后才来到北京的日本科学家们，也向中国朋友倾吐了自己的心情。日本科学家代表团团长野上茂吉郎说：“接见的那天，我能够坐在毛泽东主席这位伟大的思想家、中国人民卓越的领袖近旁，这是我一生中不能忘记的宝贵时刻。”
    来自非洲的苏丹科学家阿明说得好：今天晚上，是北京物理讨论会的最高潮。
    这是欢乐的最高潮！这是幸福的最高潮！
    是啊，人们怎能不欢乐，怎能不感到幸福呢？“这是同中国人民伟大领袖的会见，是同全世界革命人民的伟大领袖、导师和旗手的会见啊！”
    在乘车回宾馆的路上，在回到宾馆以后的宁静的深夜里，许多人还找中国朋友谈论着，相互间谈论着，有些人在无限兴奋和激动中度过了一个不眠之夜。
    伊拉克的另一位科学家吉塔，刚到中国来时曾经说过：“这次要是见不到毛主席，我就不回去了！”现在，他终于见到了毛主席。他激动极了！他事后告诉别人，毛主席接见的时候，他的心情一秒钟也平静不下来，一直兴奋得满身出汗，衣服都被汗水湿透了。他满怀无限深情，对中国朋友说：“毛主席不仅是属于你们的，也是属于我们的，是属于全世界人民的。他不仅和中国人民一起前进，也和我们一起前进。你们应当为他感到自豪！他是个最伟大的人啊！”
    塞拉勒窝内科学家贾洛，在毛主席同他握手的时候，他情不自禁用刚学会的中国话喊着：“毛泽东万岁！”
    来自厄瓜多尔的科学家巴拉甘·罗梅罗，在毛主席接见时，激动得流下了眼泪。在乘车回宾馆的路上，他在车上还流着泪。一路上，他和厄瓜多尔的另一位科学家、六十多岁的古斯塔沃·蒙卡约，再三要求中国译员教他们用中国话喊“毛主席万岁”，一遍又一遍认真地学着。回到宾馆以后，古斯塔沃·蒙卡约逢人便说：“毛主席和我握了手啦，我真太幸福了，太光荣了！”
      “我真太幸福了，太光荣了！”这是来自四大洲的各国朋友们共同的心声。他们表示要把这最美好、最幸福的记忆带回国去，传达给他们的亲人、朋友和他们所认识的每一个人，让他们也分享自己的幸福和光荣。
    日本科学家小川修三、横尾由松和锡兰科学家坎南加拉，在毛主席接见以后，都兴冲冲地跑来同中国译员们紧紧地握手，说：这是毛主席同我们握过的手，你们也来分享一分幸福吧！坎南加拉还说：“没有毛泽东主席这位伟大的人，中国不可能有今天！”阿根廷的科学家们向别人表示他们的兴奋心情时说，因为毛主席同他们握过了手，他们简直想往后再也不洗手了。他们说：有了伟大的毛泽东思想，才有今天中国的伟大成就。
  毛主席这样健康是世界人民的幸福
    在毛主席接见的前几天，当各国科学家们得悉毛主席畅游长江的喜讯时，他们便争相传告，纷纷找来报纸，喜看毛主席的焕发神采，从中得到了无限的鼓舞。今天，当他们亲眼见到毛主席是那样健康的时候，他们又怎能不欢乐，怎能不感到无限幸福呢！来自四大洲的科学家们说：毛主席这样健康，这不仅是中国人民的幸福，也是全世界人民的幸福！
    印度尼西亚科学家苏哈里约，缅甸科学家吴叫敏，还有日本、柬埔寨、刚果（布）以及其他许多国家的科学家，在毛主席接见刚结束时，便纷纷兴高采烈地告诉别人：毛主席红光满面，神采奕奕，精力充沛，身体好极了！厄瓜多尔科学家罗梅罗感动得握住中国朋友的双手，热泪盈眶地说：“好极了，好极了！毛主席非常非常地健康啊！”几内亚科学家赛杜说：“毛主席身体这样健康，这是全世界人民的幸福。接见时，毛主席那魁梧的身躯刚一出现，我们的心便无限地激动起来，整个大厅都沸腾起来了！”
    来自乌拉圭的科学家格龙波内，来自乌干达的科学家穆拉尼，来自摩洛哥的科学家瓦扎尼和其他一些国家的科学家，亲眼见到毛主席以后，都不相信毛主席今年已有七十多岁，说是顶多象五六十岁的人。智利科学家马丁诺亚更是无限赞叹地说：毛主席经历过二万五千里长征，经历过千辛万苦，今天还要考虑天下大事，他老人家仍然这样健康，真是了不起啊！
    哥伦比亚科学家甘巴夫人也一再指出，毛主席如此健康是全世界人民的幸福。她还对中国朋友们表示，她不仅要把自己的亲眼所见转告她所认识的每一位热爱毛主席的人，而且要写成文章，驳斥帝国主义在西方世界散布的谎言。
    毛主席是人类历史上最伟大的巨人
    这次前来参加北京物理讨论会的四大洲各国科学家，有些人在来北京之前便读过毛主席的书，从中得到了启发和力量。在这次来到北京之后，有的人一下飞机便要求中国工作人员在他的房间里放上一套《毛泽东选集》，有的人自己购买了《毛泽东选集》，有的人利用十多天来的早晚休息时间读完了《毛泽东选集》第一卷，有的人在会议上和在参观中一再赞颂伟大的毛泽东思想，赞颂中国人民在毛泽东思想指引下所取得的巨大成就。毛主席亲自接见了各国科学家，更被他们看作是鼓舞自己前进的巨大力量。
    在毛主席接见的那天晚上，哥伦比亚科学家甘巴随身携带着毛主席的《实践论》，接见以后，他又拿出来阅读。甘巴夫人说，毛主席指导革命的理论，不仅对本世纪，而且将千年万载地起到它的伟大作用。塞拉勒窝内科学家贾洛谈到，今后再阅读毛主席著作时，就会想起毛主席这次接见时的情景，从而感到倍加亲切，增添无穷的力量。有的科学家表示，回国后一定要宣传中国革命和建设的巨大成就，宣传毛泽东思想。
    来自柬埔寨、阿尔及利亚和智利的三位科学家，在毛主席接见以后热情地说过的一些话，也许可以代表四大洲科学家对毛主席无限崇敬的心情。
    柬埔寨科学家塔路易说：“毛泽东主席是一个伟大的人物，一个伟大的天才，历史上任何一个天才都比不上他。伟大的毛泽东思想，将在任何时候都起作用。”
    阿尔及利亚科学家优素福说：“毛主席是人类历史上最伟大的巨人，是一个经历过长征的伟大劳动者和革命家。一个国家的领导人，能够得到七亿人民的完全信任和无限热爱，他的思想能为七亿人民所接受，并且在各个领域内得到应用和取得辉煌成绩，这在人类历史上是罕见的。”
    永远留在记忆之中
    智利科学家达尼洛·比利亚罗埃尔说：“现在全世界革命者都向往着毛主席，向往着中国共产党，向往着伟大的中国人民。毛主席著作已经成为世界人民革命的光辉灯塔。如果全世界人民都遵照毛主席指引的方向走，那么，毫无疑问，全世界革命将会大踏步前进。我对毛主席有着最高的信仰，这是因为毛主席无论在政治或军事等方面都发展了马克思列宁主义，对世界人民革命作出了杰出的贡献。毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的论点，是最正确的战略和策略观点。全世界革命人民需要毛主席这样一个天才的创造性的马克思主义者。”
    这次幸福的会见，将永远留在各国科学家的记忆之中。科学家们纷纷用最美好的语言，在笔记本上记述同毛主席会见的时刻：
      “这是我一生中最高的荣誉！”一位阿拉伯国家的科学家说。
    “这是我终身最大的荣幸！”缅甸科学家吴达莱说。
    “这是最珍贵的时刻，是幸福的高峰！”摩洛哥科学家瓦扎尼说。
    这些以各个不同国家的语言道出的激动心情，表达了四大洲各国科学家们的同一个声音，也是全世界革命人民的声音：“毛主席啊，您是我们心中不落的太阳！”
