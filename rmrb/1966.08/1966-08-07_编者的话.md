These articles on educational criticism written by workers, peasants, and soldiers are vivid and lively, filled with strong class sentiments, and contain many profound truths worth reading.

Culture is created by the laboring people. In the old society, the culture they created was monopolized by the exploiting classes and became a spiritual shackle to enslave the laboring people. After national liberation, under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat in our country, the laboring people have stood up, become masters of the country, and opened the doors of science and culture to the laboring people. Workers and peasants and their children have the priority to receive education. However, because bourgeois intellectuals have taken control of some of our schools, the educational policies of the Party and Chairman Mao have not been implemented, and workers and peasants and their children are still subjected to various forms of discrimination and suppression. The Central Committee of the Party and Chairman Mao have repeatedly criticized this extremely unreasonable phenomenon, and the workers and peasants have long had their complaints. However, those bourgeois intellectuals stubbornly adhere to their educational ideology and line.

In this great proletarian cultural revolution, Chairman Mao has issued a great call: the school system must be shortened, education must be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals controlling our schools must not continue. This fully accords with the wishes of the laboring people. The broad laboring people have launched a resolute struggle against the representatives of the bourgeoisie in the educational field. They say: "We must seize the pens from the hands of the bourgeoisie and return culture to the laborers." They are right and well said! We must thoroughly criticize the old educational ideas, smash the old educational system, and let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high on the educational front!

    编者的话
    这几篇工农兵写的教育批判文章，生动活泼，充满了强烈的阶级感情，讲了许多深刻的道理，值得大家一读。
    文化是劳动人民创造的。在旧社会，他们创造的文化却被剥削阶级垄断起来，变成奴役劳动人民的精神枷锁。全国解放以后，在我国无产阶级专政的条件下，劳动人民翻了身，当家做了主人。科学文化的大门也为劳动人民敞开着。工农及其子女享有受教育的优先权。但是，由于资产阶级知识分子统治了我们的一些学校，党和毛主席提出的教育方针得不到贯彻，工农及其子女依然受到百般的排斥和打击。对这种极不合理的现象，党中央和毛主席一再严厉地批评，工农群众也早有意见。但是，那些资产阶级知识分子顽固地坚持他们那一套教育思想、教育路线。
    在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，毛主席发出了伟大号召：学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。这完全符合劳动人民的心意。广大的劳动人民向教育界的资产阶级代表人物展开了坚决的斗争。他们说：“要把资产阶级手里的笔杆子夺过来，让文化回到劳动者手里来。”说得对，说得好！我们一定要彻底批判旧的教育思想，砸碎旧的教育制度，让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，永远在教育战线上高高飘扬！
