I previously did not fully understand the importance of studying Chairman Mao's works, thinking that even if one studies well, if production tasks are not completed, one still cannot report satisfactory results. Therefore, study time was often not used for learning. I did not study myself, and sometimes I also hindered others from studying. During study time, it was either pulling cadres to discuss work or having them report situations. At that time, I also had a wrong view, thinking that transportation cadres work ten or more hours a day, year-round without holidays, and even working while lying down still cannot complete tasks, so where is the time to study? Especially in a large marshalling yard like Harbin, if someone says the "boss" has time to study, I would definitely want to debate with them. Because I did not study Chairman Mao's works well, over the past decade, despite working hard from dawn to dusk, my work still could not keep up with the demands of the times.

In 1963, Chairman Mao issued the great call to "Learn from Comrade Lei Feng," and the country launched the movement to learn from the People's Liberation Army and Daqing. This had a great impact on me. I repeatedly thought: Why is the People's Liberation Army such a highly proletarianized and highly combat-ready force? Why is Daqing so outstanding in such a harsh environment? Our station has been around longer than Daqing and has better conditions, so why is our work not as good as theirs? After thinking it over, I realized that they have a common fundamental experience: In all work, they hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, seriously read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. It was then that I began to realize: Not studying well, I have already fallen far behind. To truly do a good job, I must strive to study Chairman Mao's works and in all work insist on Mao Zedong Thought taking the lead.

Once the mindset was clear, specific problems in studying were easier to solve. Work was still as busy, but every day I could squeeze out one or two hours for study; if I missed it, I could make it up later. It was precisely because I studied Chairman Mao's works and acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions that I was able to move the "switch points" in my mind, one by one, from the "wrong position" to the right position.

Straightening Out the Relationship Between the Individual and the Masses

Since taking on leadership duties, I often failed to properly handle the relationship between myself and the masses, often placing myself above the masses. In handling daily work, I rarely consulted with the masses or listened to their opinions; I was even less willing to hear opposing views. Even when consulting with the masses, it was often just a formality, imposing my will. When problems arose below, I criticized and reprimanded more, and was less patient in persuading and educating. I also did not care enough about the masses' living conditions. All of this not only caused tension between myself and the masses but also directly brought a bad influence to the Party.

The masses had criticized my mindset many times. Some comrades bluntly criticized me for having an official's air. But I felt that this hat did not fit me. I thought, who doesn't know that I have been working at this station since the puppet regime, doing odd jobs, being a switchman, etc.? Where did this official's air come from? I thought that the masses had so many complaints about me because I was in a leadership position and had many responsibilities; I even wrongly thought that being strict with the masses and criticizing them harshly was a sign of being responsible for the work. The mindset was not clear, so there was no real change. Sometimes I changed superficially, admitting that my language and attitude were a bit rough, talking to workers, visiting dormitories, canteens, and small groups, discussing issues, but I did not truly solve the problem in my mind.

In the spring of 1964, I and all the station cadres went deep into the teams, labored with the workers, talked heart-to-heart, made friends, and even moved my luggage to the workers' dormitory. When I first went, no one wanted to live in the same room with me. The room I lived in, no one else would go to. When I visited other dormitories, the workers would be chatting lively, but as soon as I entered the room, it would become silent. What was the reason? Once, an old worker said to me: "Comrade Liu, we both started working on the railway during the puppet regime. Since you became the station master, your temper changed, and you rarely had heart-to-heart talks with us. We all feel intimidated when we see you." Hearing this, I felt my face burning. At that time, I realized that there was a significant gap between myself and the masses. I thought, in the past, I was also a sufferer. During the puppet regime, under the rule of the Japanese devils, I and some old workers endured beatings and curses, suffering the devils' exploitation and oppression. After liberation, the Party trained me to become a cadre, but I became arrogant and developed a bureaucratic mindset, forgetting the bitterness of the old society and the Party's teachings. Thinking of this, I felt very sad. Later, I studied Chairman Mao's articles on the mass line and further realized: In our country, the relationship between leaders and the led is one of comrades, and cadres and the masses only have different responsibilities. Cadres are not the masters of the people but the servants of the people. Yet, in the past, I had reversed the relationship between myself and the masses. How could I do a good job?

The "switch points" in my mind were moved, my understanding improved, and I began to improve in relying on and believing in the masses. For example, clearing snow from the switches is an important task during our winter transportation. In the past, every time it snowed heavily, we would have to ask other units to support us with four or five hundred people for two or three days. In the winter of 1964, inspired by Chairman Mao's self-reliance, we planned to do it ourselves without external help. But could we manage without external help? I was not sure. I visited more than twenty old workers, and they were very confident. Later, I mobilized everyone to come up with ideas and solutions. The workers enthusiastically offered suggestions. On the night of November 5, the first heavy snow fell. Under the slogan "Snow is a command," all off-duty workers came to the station to clear the snow. Some workers lived tens of miles away from the station, braving the wind and snow, arriving at the station at around one in the morning to participate in clearing the snow. With the enthusiastic efforts of all the station workers, we quickly cleared the snow from the switches. Throughout the winter, everyone worked with this spirit, overcoming several heavy snowfalls, ensuring smooth train operations, and successfully completing the busy winter transportation tasks.

Through this period of study and practice, I deeply felt that the masses are the creators of history, and they have boundless wisdom and strength. Some things that seem complex and difficult to me, once handed over to the masses, have solutions. Leaders must first place themselves among the masses, unite with the masses, rely on the masses, and concentrate the masses' wisdom to better lead the masses in completing various tasks.

Straightening Out the Relationship Between Political Leadership and Enforcing Rules and Regulations

In the past, bourgeois management methods and the influence of the "one-man management" system had a certain position in my mind. Over the years, although I have received the Party's education and help, my understanding has improved, but deep down, I still thought that rules and orders, material incentives could quickly solve problems. Therefore, in my work, I often relied on two "tricks": one was rules and regulations, administrative orders; the other was criticism and punishment, material incentives. When important tasks came, I would promise bonuses in advance. When problems arose, I would not seriously find the ideological causes but would simply modify the rules and establish regulations.

For a period, transportation work was passive, and the safety situation was not good. To change the then passive situation, we drafted three measures for handling violations: first violation, the section chief talks; second violation, the transportation chief talks and deducts part of the piecework bonus; third violation, the station master talks, not only canceling the individual's piecework bonus but also deducting 50% of the bonus from other members of the team. These "regulations" were announced to the masses, causing great dissatisfaction. As a result, not only were violations not eliminated, but accidents continued to occur. At that time, I was greatly shocked, feeling that this was not the way to solve problems. So, I took this problem to study Chairman Mao's "Care for the People's Livelihood, Pay Attention to Work Methods." Chairman Mao said: "Not opposing bureaucratic work methods but adopting practical and specific work methods, not abandoning commandist work methods but adopting patient persuasion methods, then no task can be accomplished." Chairman Mao's teachings made me realize: Handling accidents must insist on political leadership, with persuasion and education as the main approach; even necessary punishments are for the purpose of education. Simple punishment cannot achieve the educational purpose and is also not a good way to lead production. Understanding this truth, when handling accidents, I adopted the method of persuasion and education as the main approach, emphasizing seeking truth from facts, distinguishing between cases, drawing lessons, and improving work. Once, a switchman had an accident. We did not adopt the past method of deducting bonuses and giving punishments but had individual talks with him and held three heart-to-heart meetings with his team, analyzing the root cause of the accident and finding the lessons. Afterwards, he said to the leadership with tears in his eyes: "Because of my momentary carelessness, I caused such a big loss to the state, it's like a knife stabbing my heart, I will definitely be more careful in my work and not have accidents." Using this method to handle accidents was praised by the majority of workers. They said, in the past, accidents were feared, but now accidents are regretted. From then on, a new situation quickly emerged across the station where everyone voluntarily followed rules and regulations and ensured safety.

Practice has proven: As a leader of a socialist enterprise, one must remember Chairman Mao's teachings, insist on political leadership, and start from raising ideological awareness to mobilize the enthusiasm of the workers; one must not simply rely on rules and orders to get things done. Rules and regulations are a summary of production practice experience and must be strictly followed. But ultimately, they are implemented by people. When people's awareness is raised and enthusiasm is mobilized, not only can they voluntarily implement rules and regulations, but they can also achieve effects that rules and regulations cannot.

Straightening Out the Relationship Between Ideological Work and Production Work

In the past, I always thought that ideological and political work was the Party committee's responsibility and had nothing to do with administration. A year of study and practice has gradually made me realize: Ideological work is not just the Party committee's responsibility. Any work must emphasize politics, and the primary task of administrative cadres is also to do a good job in ideological and political work.

In April 1964, the volume of transportation suddenly increased, the transportation order was chaotic, and congestion occurred. Some train dispatchers were almost frightened by such a big task. At the beginning, I spent the whole day in the office, calculating indicators, personnel, and equipment capacity. After calculating, I came up with "one big" (the task is big) and "three tight" (indicators are tight, personnel are tight, capacity is tight). I thought that to complete such a big task, we must add two more shunting locomotives or change the marshalling plan. Facing this situation, I accepted the lessons of the past, neither shouting difficulties to the superiors nor putting pressure on the subordinates. Instead, under the unified arrangement of the Party committee, I first organized all the station cadres and train dispatchers to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's discussions on the mass line and other articles. I also spent a week giving a big lecture on the situation and tasks to all the workers in the transportation department, greatly encouraging revolutionary enthusiasm, making the majority of cadres and workers understand that the task is big, which is a sign of the good situation of the country, and it is a good thing to fight against difficulties in revolution. On the basis of raising ideological awareness and understanding the situation, we summarized and promoted six advanced experiences, including dispatcher Ma Yueying's leading the backward with the advanced and focusing on active ideology, and track foreman Sun Hongchang's strengthening cooperation and doing everything possible to improve shunting efficiency. We launched a learning, helping, and competing campaign. As a result, we quickly turned around the passive situation of transportation congestion and successfully completed the transportation tasks for May.

Tasting the sweetness of emphasizing politics, my ideological understanding became clearer, and I became more conscious of insisting on the "four firsts." In daily work, we paid attention to improving the production team leaders' ability to do ideological work, holding training classes for team leaders and political propagandists who do not leave production. I and the political commissar ate, lived, and studied with them, giving them guidance, talking about the great significance of studying Chairman Mao's works, talking about the "four firsts" and the "three-eighths" style, and exchanging experiences in ideological and political work. Through study and training, we strengthened the team's ideological and political work. At the same time, we paid attention to the active ideology in production, using one person or one outstanding event to educate everyone.

Practice made me understand: The primary task of an enterprise leader is to arm the cadres and workers with Mao Zedong Thought, do a good job in people's ideological work, promote the ideological revolution of the workers, and build a revolutionary workforce armed with Mao Zedong Thought. With such a workforce, production can truly be improved.

### 把思想上的“道岔子”搬过来

　　把思想上的“道岔子”搬过来
　　哈尔滨铁路局哈尔滨站站长　刘宗相
    我过去对学习毛主席著作的重要意义认识不足，认为学习得再好，生产任务完不成，也一样交不了差。因此，学习时间，常常不能用来学习。自己不学习，有时还妨碍别人学习。在学习时间里，不是拉干部研究工作，就是找他们汇报情况。当时，我还有一个错误的看法，认为搞运输的干部，一天干十多个小时工作，一年到头没年没节，打着铺盖干还完不成任务，那有时间学习呢？特别是哈尔滨这么大的编组站，谁要说“头头”能有时间学习，我非得跟他好好辩论辩论不可。正因为自己没有好好学习毛主席著作，十几年来，尽管起早贪黑地干，工作总是跟不上形势要求。
    一九六三年，毛主席发出了“向雷锋同志学习”的伟大号召，全国开展了大学解放军、大学大庆的运动，对我震动很大。我反复地想：解放军为什么能成为一支非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的队伍？大庆为什么在那样艰苦的环境里干的那么出色？我们车站资格比大庆老，条件也很好，为什么工作不如人家呢？想来想去，认识到他们有一条共同的根本经验，就是：在一切工作中高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，认真读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。这时，我才初步认识到：没有好好学习，自己已经大大落后了。要想真正做好工作，就必须努力学习毛主席著作，在一切工作中坚持以毛泽东思想挂帅。
    思想通了，学习中的具体问题就好解决了。工作还是那样多，但每天都能挤出一两个小时进行学习；有时挤掉了，也能补上。正是由于学习了毛主席著作，照毛主席的指示办事，才把我思想上的“道岔子”，一个一个地由“反位”搬了过来。
    摆正了个人和群众的关系
    我担任领导工作以来，个人与群众的关系常常摆不正，往往把自己置于群众之上。在处理日常工作中，很少和群众商量，听取群众意见；更不愿听相反的意见。就是同群众商量，也多是“走形式，灌意图”。下面出了问题，批评指责的多，耐心说服教育的少。对群众的生活问题，也关心体贴不够。所有这些，不仅造成个人和群众的关系紧张，而且也直接给党带来不好的影响。
    群众对我这种思想作风，提出过多次批评。有的同志一针见血地批评我有官架子。但是，我觉得这顶帽子给我戴上不合适。心想，谁还不知道我从伪满时候就在这个车站当杂役，干勾子手、调车员，那来的官架子！认为群众对我意见大，是因为自己担任领导工作，管的事多；甚至错误地认为，对群众管的严，批评的狠，就是对工作负责的表现。思想没有搞通，就谈不到真正的改，有时候从表面上改一些，向群众承认言语态度有些粗暴，找工人谈谈心，到宿舍、食堂、小组走走，就事论事，并没有从思想上真正解决问题。
    一九六四年春天，我和全站干部一起，深入到班组，与工人同劳动，谈心，交朋友，还把行李搬到工人宿舍。刚去的时候，谁也不愿意和我住在一个屋，我住的屋子别人都不去。到别人宿舍串门，本来工人们在房间里谈得挺热闹，我一进屋，就变得鸦雀无声。这是什么原因？有一次，一位老工人对我说：“刘站长，咱们都是伪满时候一块儿上铁路的。自从你当了站长以后，脾气变了，很少跟我们说几句知心话，我们见了你都感到打怵。”听了这话，我感到脸上火辣辣地不是滋味。这时，我觉察到自己和群众已经有了相当大的距离。我想，过去我也是受苦的人，伪满时候在日本鬼子的统治下，和一些老工人一起挨打受骂，受尽了鬼子的剥削压迫。解放后，党培养我当了干部，我就“官”升脾气长，沾染上了官僚主义的思想作风，忘记了旧社会的苦，忘记了党的谆谆教导。想到这里，我心里非常难过。后来，又学习了毛主席有关群众路线的文章，进一步认识到：在我们国家里，领导与被领导之间是同志关系，干部和群众只是分工不同，干部不是人民群众的老爷，而是人民群众的勤务员。可是过去，我却把个人与群众的关系根本摆颠倒了，怎么能做好工作呢？
    思想上的“道岔子”搬过来了，认识提高了，在依靠群众、相信群众方面开始有了改进。例如，道岔除雪是我们冬季运输中一项特殊的重要任务。往年每下一场大雪，就得要求别的单位支援四、五百人干上两三天。一九六四年冬天，在毛主席的自力更生思想启发下，打算自己动手，不求外援。可是不靠外援行不行呢？心里没有底。我先后访问了二十多位老工人，他们信心很大。以后，又发动大家出主意，想办法。职工们纷纷献计献策。十一月五日夜间下了第一次大雪。在“下雪就是命令”的口号下，休班职工全部来到车站扫雪。有的职工家离车站十几里路，不顾风雪，在深夜一点多钟徒步赶到车站参加扫雪。在全站职工的积极奋战下，迅速地清除了道岔上的积雪。整整一个冬天，全体同志就是以这种精神，战胜了多次大雪，保证了列车畅通无阻，顺利地完成了繁忙的冬运任务。
    通过这一段学习和实践，我深深体会到，群众是历史的创造者，他们有无穷的智慧和力量。有些事情在自己看来是复杂、难办的，一旦交给群众，就有了解决的办法。领导干部只有首先把自己置身于群众之中，团结群众，依靠群众，把群众的智慧集中起来，才能领导群众更好地完成各项任务。
    摆正了政治挂帅和执行规章制度的关系
    过去，资产阶级的管理方法和一长制的影响，在我思想上占有一定的位置。几年来，虽然经过党的教育和帮助，认识有所提高，但思想深处仍然认为规章命令、物质鼓励能够很快地解决问题。因此，工作中常常靠两个“法宝”：一个是规章制度，行政命令；一个是批评处分，物质刺激。来了重大任务，就事先许愿给奖金。发生了问题，不是认真找思想原因，而是单纯地去修改规章，订立制度。
    有一个时期，运输工作被动，安全情况不好。为了改变当时的被动局面，我们就拟定了处理违章作业的三条措施：一次违章，由区主任谈话；二次违章，由运输主任谈话，并扣一部分计件奖金；三次违章，由站长谈话，不仅取消本人计件奖励，而且对小组其他成员也各扣奖金百分之五十。这些“法规”向群众宣布后，引起了群众极大的不满。结果，不但没有杜绝违章事件，相反，事故连续发生。当时对我震动很大，觉得这样下去不行，这不是解决问题的办法。于是，我就带着这个问题，学习了《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》。毛主席说：“不反对官僚主义的工作方法而采取实际的具体的工作方法，不抛弃命令主义的工作方法而采取耐心说服的工作方法，那末，什么任务也是不能实现的。”毛主席的教导，使我认识到：处理事故，必须坚持政治挂帅，以说服教育为主；就是必要的处分也是为达到教育的目的，单纯惩罚，是达不到教育目的，也是领导不好生产的。明白了这个道理，我在处理事故的时候，采取了以说服教育为主的方法，并强调实事求是，区别对待，吸取教训，改进工作。有一次，一位搬道员出了一件挤岔子事故。我们没有采取过去的一扣奖金、二给处分的做法，而是同他个别谈话，并同他们小组一起开了三次谈心会，分析发生事故的根源，找出了事故的教训。事后，他含着眼泪对领导表示：“由于我一时马虎，给国家造成了这么大的损失，真比刀子扎我的心还难受，往后我工作一定细心，不出事故。”用这种方法处理事故，受到广大职工的赞扬。他们说，过去出事故是害怕，现在出事故是痛心。从此，很快地在全站出现了一个自觉地遵守规章纪律，自觉地保证安全的新局面。
    实践证明：作为一个社会主义企业的领导者，必须牢记毛主席的教导，坚持政治挂帅，从说服教育提高思想入手，去调动职工的积极性；决不能单纯地依靠规章、命令办事。规章制度是生产实践经验的总结，必须认真执行。但归根到底，它是靠人去执行的。人的觉悟提高了，积极性调动起来了，不但能自觉地贯彻执行规章制度，而且还会收到规章制度所收不到的效果。
    摆正了抓思想和抓生产的关系
    过去我总认为，思想政治工作是党委的事，与行政无关。一年来的学习和实践，使我逐步认识到：抓思想工作，不光是党委的事。任何工作都必须突出政治，行政干部首要的任务也是做好思想政治工作。
    一九六四年四月，运量突然上涨，运输秩序混乱，出现了堵塞现象。有些行车指挥人员，简直被这么大的任务吓住了。开始，整天闷在屋里抠指标，算人员，算设备能力。算来算去，算出个“一大”（任务大）、
  “三紧”（指标紧、人员紧、能力紧）。认为要完成这么大的任务，必须增加两台调车机或改变编组计划。面对这种形势，我接受了以往的教训，既没有向上级喊困难、讲条件，又没有对下边施加压力。而是在党委的统一部署下，首先组织全站干部和行车指挥人员，反复地学习了毛主席有关群众路线的论述和其它文章。并用一周时间，给运转车间全体职工大讲形势任务，大鼓革命干劲，使广大干部、职工认清了任务大，正是全国形势大好的标志，是好事，干革命就要向困难作斗争的道理。在提高思想、认清形势的基础上，先后总结与推广了调度员马越营以先进带后进、大抓活思想，线路值班员孙洪昌加强协作、千方百计提高调车效率等六个先进经验，开展了比学赶帮竞赛。结果，迅速扭转了运输堵塞的被动局面，顺利地完成了五月份的运输任务。
    尝到了突出政治的甜头，思想认识更加明确了，坚持“四个第一”也比较自觉了。在日常工作中，我们注意了提高生产班组长做思想工作的能力，举办了不脱离生产的班组长和政治宣传员训练班，我和政委与他们同吃、同住、同学习，一块给他们做辅导，讲学习毛主席著作的重大意义，讲“四个第一”、“三八作风”，交流了思想政治工作的经验。通过学习训练，加强了班组思想政治工作。同时，注意了抓生产中的活思想，用一个人、一件突出的事，教育大家。
    实践使我懂得了：一个企业领导干部的首要任务，就是用毛泽东思想武装干部、职工的头脑，作好人的思想工作，促进职工思想革命化，建立一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命化的职工队伍。有了这样一支队伍，生产才能真正搞好。
