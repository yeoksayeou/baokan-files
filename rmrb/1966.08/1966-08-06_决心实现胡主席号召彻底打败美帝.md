The *Nhan Dan* (People's Daily) of Vietnam published an editorial on August 5th to mark the second anniversary of the American imperialists' aggression against North Vietnam. The editorial calls on the entire Vietnamese military and people to resolutely carry out Chairman Ho Chi Minh's great call to arms, to completely defeat the American aggressors.

The editorial points out that since the American imperialists began bombing North Vietnam on August 5, 1964, they have met with the resolute resistance of the entire Vietnamese people and revolutionary armed forces. The facts of the past two years have shown that the more the American aggressors escalate the war, the more they fail, and the deeper they sink into the quagmire.

The editorial points out that American imperialism is a savage and cunning aggressor. Every time it escalates the war, it puts out deceptive propaganda to cover up its crimes. Then, it gradually escalates, now reaching an extremely serious level.

The editorial states that American imperialism systematically attacks North Vietnam's dikes, water conservancy projects, hospitals, schools, economic facilities, and densely populated areas. It has twice played the "temporary halt to bombing" trick to prepare for further escalation of the war. Since June 29, it has carried out a new and extremely serious escalation: bombing Hanoi and Haiphong as well as many important dikes and dams in North Vietnam. It has committed heinous crimes against the Vietnamese people.

The editorial says, however, that those who play with fire will perish in it, and those who commit crimes will be punished. The heroic people of our North have already dealt heavy blows to American imperialism. We have shot down nearly 1,300 American modern aircraft, equivalent to twice the number of aircraft in the Seventh Fleet. Many air pirates have been killed or captured alive. The editorial emphasizes, "No matter how many hundreds of thousands of troops the American imperialists dare to send or what savage means they use, they can only have one outcome—failure. The entire military and people, responding to Chairman Hu's sacred call to save the country, are ready to concentrate all their strength to resolutely defeat the American aggressors. We will resolutely overcome all difficulties, be ready to make the necessary sacrifices at any time, and annihilate the savage aggressors."

    越南《人民报》就美帝对北方发动侵略战争两周年发表社论
    决心实现胡主席号召彻底打败美帝
    两年来北方军民已击落美国强盗飞机近一千三百架
    据新华社河内五日电  越南《人民报》八月五日就美帝国主义对越南北方发动侵略战争两周年发表社论，号召越南全国军民坚决实现胡志明主席的伟大战斗号召，彻底打败美国侵略强盗。
    《人民报》的社论指出，自从一九六四年八月五日美帝国主义开始轰炸越南北方以来，它遭到了越南全体人民和革命武装力量的坚决抗击。两年来的事实表明，美国侵略者越进行战争“升级”，就失败得越惨，他们在战争道路上走得越远，就在无法自拔的泥潭中陷得越深。
    社论指出，美帝国主义是野蛮和狡猾的侵略者，每当它进行战争“升级”的时候，就抛出了欺骗的宣传论调，企图掩盖它的罪行。接着，它便逐步“升级”，现在已经升到极其严重的梯级。
    社论说，美帝国主义有系统地袭击越南北方的堤坝、水利工程、医院、学校、经济设施和居民稠密区。它两次玩弄“暂停轰炸”把戏，来为它进一步战争“升级”作准备。从六月二十九日起，它进行了极其严重的新的战争“升级”：轰炸河内和海防以及越南北方的许多重要河堤和水坝。它对越南人民犯下了滔天罪行。
    社论说，但是，玩火者必将自焚，犯下罪行必将遭到惩罚。英雄的我国北方军民已给予美帝国主义沉重的打击。我们击落美国现代化飞机近一千三百架，等于第七舰队飞机总数的两倍。许多飞贼被打死或活捉。社论强调指出，“不管美帝国主义再冒险出动数以十万计的军队和使用什么野蛮手段，也只能有一种前途——失败。全体军民响应胡主席的神圣救国号召，已准备集中自己的一切力量，来决心战胜美国侵略强盗。我们坚决克服一切困难，随时准备作出必要的牺牲，消灭野蛮的侵略者。”
