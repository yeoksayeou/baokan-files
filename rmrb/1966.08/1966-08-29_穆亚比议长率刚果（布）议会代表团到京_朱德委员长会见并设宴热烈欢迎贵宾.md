"Victory to the people of Asia and Africa! Defeat to imperialism and old and new colonialism!" President Muambi and his wife received flowers from the youth of the capital and met warmly with the welcoming crowd.

When the delegation left Shanghai for Beijing, Vice Mayor Song Richang of Shanghai and his wife, as well as relevant officials, went to the airport to see them off.

President Muambi André Georges of the National Assembly of Congo (Brazzaville) also spoke at the banquet. He said that this visit to China is to further strengthen our friendship and cooperation, especially to formally refute the rumors spread by Western newspapers about the deterioration of relations between Congo and China. He emphasized that the relations between the two countries have never been as good as they are now, and the Congolese people believe in the sincere friendship of the Chinese people.

At the banquet hosted by President Ju De and his wife Kang Keqing this evening, President Muambi and his wife, as well as other members of the Congolese parliamentary delegation, received a warm welcome from people from all walks of life in China.

Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Kang Sheng, Guo Moruo, Yang Mingxuan, Liu Ningyi, Vice Premier of the State Council Xie Fuzhi attended the banquet this evening.

In his speech, President Ju De praised the achievements of the Congolese people under the leadership of President Massamba-Debat in opposing imperialism, suppressing reactionary forces, and maintaining national independence. He praised the recent success of the Congolese people in thwarting the subversive and destructive plots of American imperialism and its lackeys. President Ju De said that the Chinese people firmly support the Congolese people in their just struggle to maintain national independence.

President Ju De praised the anti-American struggle for national liberation of the Vietnamese people, which has made significant contributions to the anti-imperialist struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and the world. He condemned the U.S. imperialists' savage bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, escalating the aggression to a new and more serious stage. He condemned the U.S. imperialists' collusion with the Soviet revisionist leadership and other lackeys to play the trick of "bombing for peace." He said that the people of Asia and Africa must give the U.S. imperialists and their followers a resounding blow.

He said that the 700 million Chinese people have made up their minds and are fully prepared to take any actions deemed necessary by the peoples of China and Vietnam to jointly strike the American aggressors until final victory is achieved.

President Ju De emphasized that Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out: "Ending the aggression and oppression of imperialism, mainly American imperialism, is the task of all the people of the world." Let us unite the people of Asia and Africa, and let all the people of the world unite to fight against imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the United States to the end.

President Ju De said that now, our country is presenting a new situation of all-round leap forward. Under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong, an unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution is rising in our country. This revolution is of extremely profound significance for consolidating our proletarian dictatorship and socialist system, accelerating the development and victory of our socialist cause.

President Ju De warmly praised the new development of the deep friendship between the Chinese and Congolese peoples. He said that the visit of the Congolese parliamentary delegation to our country will certainly make positive contributions to further consolidating and developing the friendly relations between China and Congo (Brazzaville) and the fighting friendship between the two peoples.

In his speech, President Muambi conveyed the fraternal greetings of the Congolese people to the Chinese people. He said that this visit to China is also to see the achievements made by the heroic Chinese people united around the great and wise leader Mao Zedong in the past sixteen years. In this regard, the Chinese people have set a brilliant example for us.

The President said that the achievements of the Chinese people have made the Congolese people admire them and made the imperialists led by the United States feel uneasy.

President Muambi said that the Congolese people unreservedly support China's stance against the U.S. aggression in Vietnam, and they are convinced that the heroic Vietnamese people will ultimately achieve victory because the progressive forces of Vietnam are defending a just cause.

The President expressed his heartfelt thanks in his speech for the continuous support that the Chinese people have given to the Congolese revolution.

Those who attended the banquet also included members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Luo Qun, Zhao Yimin, Nan Hanchen, Xu Licheng, Xie Fumin, Vice Secretary-General Lian Guan, Feng Xuan, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Qi Pengfei, and other relevant officials.
