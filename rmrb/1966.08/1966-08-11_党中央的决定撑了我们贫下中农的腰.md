The Party Central Committee's decision has bolstered our poor and lower-middle peasants. When we heard the wise decision of the Party Central Committee, we were extremely excited and enthusiastically cheered for the new victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao! You have spoken the words in our hearts. Chairman Mao! You have bolstered our poor and lower-middle peasants. The sixteen points in the "Decision" all resonate with our poor and lower-middle peasants. How can we not be excited! We raise our hands firmly to support it, and we loudly shout: Long live the great Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years of life to Chairman Mao!

Not long ago, a handful of anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought black gangs attempted to restore capitalism, attempting to drag us poor and lower-middle peasants, who have already stood up, back to the old society to live a life worse than cattle and horses. We firmly oppose this! Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we take up our hoes and thoroughly, completely, and cleanly uproot these poisonous weeds that are even more venomous than vipers and scorpions, turning the weeds into fertilizer to make manure for the fields.

In the future, we will firmly study Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and be good farmers for Chairman Mao for life. With our actual actions, we will highlight proletarian politics, do a good job in production, and strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture. We will firmly defend the Party Central Committee and Mao Zedong Thought, and firmly carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!

　　党中央的决定撑了我们贫下中农的腰
    当我们听到党中央的英明决定，我们万分兴奋，热烈欢呼毛泽东思想的新胜利。
    毛主席啊！您道出了我们贫下中农的心里话。毛主席啊！您撑了我们贫下中农的腰。“决定”中的十六条，条条说到我们贫下中农的心里，我们怎能不兴奋！我们举起双手坚决拥护，我们大声地高呼：伟大的毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    在不久以前，一小撮反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的黑帮，妄想搞资本主义复辟，妄想把我们已经翻了身的、不再受苦受罪的贫下中农拉回到旧社会去，再过那牛马不如的生活。我们坚决反对！我们在党中央和毛主席的领导下，拿起我们的锄头，坚决、彻底、干净地把这伙比蝮蛇、蝎子还毒上十分的大毒草锄掉，把毒草变成肥料，用来沤粪肥田。
    我们今后坚决读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，当一辈子毛主席的好农民，用我们的实际行动，突出无产阶级政治，搞好生产，力争农业大丰收。我们要坚决捍卫党中央和毛泽东思想，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
