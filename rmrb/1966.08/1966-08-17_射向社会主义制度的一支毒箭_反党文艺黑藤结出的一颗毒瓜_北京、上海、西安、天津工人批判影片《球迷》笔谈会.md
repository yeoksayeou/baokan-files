	An Arrow Poisoned Against the Socialist System
	The Poisonous Melon from the Black Vines of Anti-Party Arts
	—Beijing, Shanghai, Xi'an, and Tianjin Workers' Discussion on Criticizing the Film "The Soccer Fan"

	Editor's Note: Directed by Xu Changlin and produced by Shanghai Tianma Film Studio, the film "The Soccer Fan" was released in 1962 as a big poisonous weed.

	Xu Changlin, the director of "The Soccer Fan," was a loyal servant of the Chiang Kai-shek regime and a faithful henchman of the literary black gang in the 1930s. Before liberation, he directed reactionary films such as "Pure Family Customs" that praised American-Chiang spies and worked as an editor for the reactionary newspaper "Zhonghua Daily." After liberation, he was appreciated and employed by the film industry's black gang, including Xia Yan and Qu Baiyin, continuing his counter-revolutionary crimes. "The Soccer Fan" is one of his pieces of evidence against the party and socialism.

	After 1961, when the head of the literary black gang, Zhou Yang, and the big shot, Xia Yan, vigorously promoted the "light and lively" "comedy" with "satire as the main feature," Xu Changlin swayed along with the tide and conspired with the anti-party, anti-socialist element Qu Baiyin to cultivate and release this poisonous weed, "The Soccer Fan." After the film was shot, it was severely criticized by the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. This gang of black elements worked tirelessly to create these "comedies" with ulterior motives. They were smiling with knives hidden, using the "laughter" trick to shamelessly defame the working class and the laboring people, defame socialist society, attack the party, attack the dictatorship of the proletariat, and prepare public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. This was the true purpose of this gang of black elements.

	Chairman Mao said: "If you are a bourgeois artist, you will not sing the praises of the proletariat but of the bourgeoisie; if you are a proletarian artist, you will not sing the praises of the bourgeoisie but of the proletariat and the laboring people: one must choose one of the two." The working class and laboring people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, following Chairman Mao's teachings, can see through all the poisonous weeds concocted by ghosts and snakes like Xu Changlin. The following articles are the criticisms of "The Soccer Fan" by workers from Beijing, Shanghai, and Xi'an, drivers from Tianjin Chemical Plant, and doctors from Beijing Union Medical College.

	First and foremost, everyone is outraged by this film—

	Brazenly Attacking the Working Class and Maliciously Defaming Laborers

	Liu Rong, Li Youyue (Beijing Trolleybus Drivers): "The Soccer Fan" from beginning to end defames our working class. These reactionaries have distorted the working class, who are the masters of the country, beyond recognition. This is what makes us most indignant. The "workers" in the movie do not talk about politics, work, or study, but during working hours, they eagerly reminisce about how "exciting" last week's soccer match was. What they talk about most enthusiastically, apart from the match, is the tickets. Their minds are filled with nothing but soccer. They do not care about work or serving the people at all. From their expressions and actions, there is not a trace of serving the people. In the depot, for a ticket, they run around crazily and fight over it; while driving, they chat with passengers; if they do not get to watch the match, they say, "If I do not watch this match, my legs will not be able to press the accelerator." They even drive wildly and accidentally enter the swimming pool. This is purely the nonsense of the American "beat generation" and hooligans, but the director deliberately brought it to China, intending to use it to slander the working class of New China!

	Wang Miaotao, Yang Lianshan, Hua Haicheng, Wang Dada, Wang Shunlong, Fu Miaofa, Zhang Xiande (Shanghai Taxi Drivers): Among us drivers, there are many who love sports. We have soccer enthusiasts, table tennis enthusiasts, and those who love track and field, swimming, and other sports. But these activities are all voluntary and organized during breaks before and after shifts and on holidays. Our extracurricular sports activities have a clear political purpose, which is to cultivate revolutionary will, enhance physical fitness, defend the motherland, and serve production. Many drivers are not only active participants in sports but also production experts and enthusiastic learners of Chairman Mao's works. They are nothing like the drivers in "The Soccer Fan": heroes on the field, good guys in grabbing tickets, but lazybones in production and monsters in service. This is not malicious fabrication?

	Ye Bili, Dong Yingqi, Jiang Yulin (Beijing Union Medical College Doctors): As revolutionary medical workers, we cannot tolerate the director's defamation of doctors. Doctors in New China follow Chairman Mao's instructions to "save the dying and heal the wounded, and practice revolutionary humanitarianism," serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The doctor Li in the movie, however, is a typical bourgeois hooligan from the old society. Where does he have a bit of the flavor of a white-clad warrior in a socialist country? As soon as he appears, he is disgusting, dressed in a neat suit, holding a cane, and accompanied by a strange-looking, soft-spoken woman. When Doctor Li encounters Huang Xiuying, who is pregnant and buying flowers, his expression is so excited that it is not at all like a normal attitude of a people's doctor towards a patient. As the plot develops, Doctor Li becomes even more ridiculous: as soon as he sees someone returning a ticket, he rushes forward to snatch it, even breaking his glasses; when Huang Xiuying's mother comes to call Doctor Li to deliver the baby, instead of going out through the main gate, he climbs down from the stadium stand step by step, hanging on the trellis... He is truly a laughing stock, and the director has defamed the image of doctors to the extreme.

	Li Tingyun (Beijing Taxi Driver): The director of "The Soccer Fan" not only defames our working class but also defames our revolutionary cadres and medical workers in socialist society, and defames many laboring people. For a ticket, fathers fight with sons, comrades fight with comrades, and spectators fight with spectators outside the stadium gate. A ticket, everyone fights for it, snatches it, snatches it, snatches it... Everyone only cares about themselves and does not care about others. This is the distorted image of the Chinese people by the director! In the director's malicious pen, we laboring people have become a group of "idiots" who only know how to eat, drink, and play, and do not understand or care about anything else. They live only to watch soccer. In fact, laboring people are the most concerned about their class brothers. Whenever there is a matter at hand, they always think of others first and consider the interests of others as particularly important. Take watching soccer as an example. Among us, there are also those who love to watch soccer, but no matter how exciting the soccer match is, or how rare the tickets are, we always give way to each other. Sometimes, because everyone gives way, in the end, no one goes. This is the noble style of our working class! We want to ask the director of the film, what is the intention behind such malicious defamation of the image of laboring people?

	This worker comrade is right. What is the intention behind the director of "The Soccer Fan" maliciously defaming the image of the great working class and laboring people?

	What kind of vine produces what kind of melon, what kind of class speaks what kind of words. Xu Changlin and his ilk, like all the creators of big poisonous weeds against the party and socialism, have deep hatred for the Communist Party, the working class, the socialist system, and the dictatorship of the proletariat. Their bourgeois reactionary paradise has been completely destroyed by the people's revolution led by the Communist Party, and they can no longer lord it over the laboring people. However, they are still alive, and their hearts are not dead. They are always thinking of snatching back their "thrones" from the people. Therefore, they maliciously curse and attack our entire socialist society. Workers in the audience are very indignant about this, and they unanimously say with their personal experiences:

	New Society with Countless New People and New Customs
	Refuting the Director's Shameless Slander

	Sun Yonglu (Beijing Bus Company Staff): The director of "The Soccer Fan" not only makes a big deal out of the ticket-snatching scene to defame the working class but also uses the scene of an old lady finding a doctor to deliver a baby to defame the relationship between people in socialist society. The old lady asks the ticket checker to find the doctor from the stadium, but the ticket checker unreasonably refuses, saying, "If the referee blows the whistle, it will affect the players' concentration, and if the ball is kicked wrong, who is responsible, you or me?" Such people and things that do not save people in urgent need but only consider who is responsible do not exist in our working class. Our bus drivers, as long as they encounter passengers who are sick or about to give birth on the bus, will do their best to quickly send the patients to the hospital. The passengers on the bus also show the style of "one person in trouble, everyone comes to help," some voluntarily get off the bus and change to another bus, and some help the driver and conductor escort the patient! This is the true portrayal of New China. We will not allow the director's malicious fabrication!

	Xi'an Municipal Transportation Bureau Cultural Revolution Combat Team: Over the past ten years, Xi'an has also held many national-level first and second division basketball tournaments. Each time the competition is held, our transportation department has dozens of buses every day to pick up and drop off athletes and spectators. During the tournament, there are many vehicles coming and going outside the stadium, and the drivers all yield safely, strictly following the safety experience of "waiting for a minute rather than rushing for a second," and under the command and coordination of traffic police, the vehicles coming and going are in good order. The director of "The Soccer Fan" depicts the order inside the stadium as chaotic and smoky, and the public transportation vehicles outside the stadium as fighting and jostling, crowded and disorderly, which is not like our socialist city at all. From the chaotic situation on the screen, it looks like New York in the United States!

	Liu Rong: The characters in this poisonous weed, "The Soccer Fan," from old to young, from male to female, are not serious at all. Two students lied that they came from out of town by train to watch the soccer match. The driver's son, Xiaoli, is only seven or eight years old, but he is just like his crazy father, rushing out of the house without eating, hurrying to watch the match, and following his father's footsteps with every step. Where his father goes around a tree, he also goes around there. This is the director's malicious suggestion to people: the working class has degenerated, and the next generation of the working class is also degenerating!

	The director of "The Soccer Fan" deliberately uses the "lively" and chaotic scenes to confuse people's vision, attempting to achieve the evil goal of slandering socialist society. They deliberately want people to believe that in socialist society, the working class chases after eating, drinking, and entertainment, and all class love, concern, and help between comrades have disappeared. Everyone fights over a ticket, and no one gives way to anyone, fighting so hard that their glasses are broken. This is not socialist China but the capitalist West!

	I drive the No. 13 trolleybus, and our route passes right by the Workers' Stadium. The activities held inside the stadium are frequent. Every time there is a sports event, our buses have to pick up and drop off tens of thousands of spectators. Most of these spectators are workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary cadres. They board our buses very orderly. They take care of the elderly, the weak, the sick, and the disabled, and pregnant women, and voluntarily give up their seats. The actions of these spectators fully embody the concern and love between comrades in our socialist society. After we drivers have safely delivered all the spectators to the stadium, we "do not leave the car, and the car does not leave us" and stand guard at our posts, using the waiting time to clean the bus thoroughly, so that the passengers can comfortably sit on our bus after the match and go home to rest.

	The director of "The Soccer Fan" ignores these facts and insists on slandering our new society as a mess. This is because they want to use this to vent their hatred for the new society. We workers have seen through their black hearts and now must cut off the black hands of these ghosts and snakes!

	Many comrades have pointed out: this film extensively displays many bourgeois lifestyles, strange clothes, and weird shapes, spreading bourgeois and revisionist poisons. The director's intentions are extremely sinister. His evil purpose is to poison the minds of the audience, especially the younger generation, attempting to make them fall into the trap in the laughter and swallow the poison.

	These comrades are right:

	Promoting Bourgeois Lifestyles is a Poisoned Sugar-Coated Bullet to Poison the Audience

	Wang Miaotao and seven other comrades: "The Soccer Fan" not only defames laboring people but also carefully portrays a bourgeois big boss. That "fat soccer fan" holds a cigar in his mouth, carries a briefcase, and is well-dressed and polite. While a group of male and female soccer fans, young and old, are going crazy over a ticket, he alone watches from the side, unmoved. In the end, he gives a ticket away for free, "granted" to the worker and the doctor. The director's intention to beautify the capitalist is now clear.

	Jia Deyi (Beijing Taxi Driver): The director of "The Soccer Fan" uses the so-called comedy method to pile up a lot of vulgar and low-level bourgeois things. Suits and leather shoes, strange clothes, hooligans, eating and drinking, all are the bourgeois style. The director of the film is trying to make people unaware of the ghosts and snakes' conspiracy to restore capitalism in the laughter. This is the director's sinister intention to hide a knife behind a smile.

	Ye Bili and three other comrades: The director of this film vigorously promotes the decadent bourgeois lifestyle, making a big deal out of eating, drinking, and entertainment, and the lens repeatedly shows the strange clothes of hooligans. These rotten and stinking rags are all picked up and vigorously promoted by the director. The director also describes all the men, women, old, and young in the film as soccer fans. Watching soccer is everything, everything for watching soccer. Everything revolves around soccer, watching and discussing soccer matches has become the only purpose of people's lives. He creates this ugly "comedy," which is actually advocating the fallacy of Deng Tuo and his ilk that "leisure time is the first interest and a free field for broad roaming." It blatantly leads people to a path of not caring about politics, only talking about eating, drinking, and entertainment, and pursuing a bourgeois lifestyle. This is a poisoned sugar-coated bullet to poison the audience, an important method to carry out the conspiracy of "peaceful evolution."

	All anti-party and anti-socialist black "scholars" have a common trick, which is to talk in code. Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and Xu Changlin are no exceptions. "The Soccer Fan" and other poisonous films have many coded words and black scenes. They attack the Communist Party, socialist society, and the dictatorship of the proletariat, revealing the director's hostile attitude towards New China everywhere.

	A Pile of Coded Words, Black Goods, and Black Scenes Reveal the Director's Evil Soul

	Sun Yonglu: "The Soccer Fan" not only uses character images to defame the image of workers but also uses many coded words to attack our party and socialist system. For example, that stadium ticket checker keeps talking about "principles," while the "soccer fan driver" curses beside him, "Isn't this cheating people?" This is a blatant insult to revolutionary principles. In the end, although the ticket checker "flexibly applies principles," allowing the "soccer fans" to enter, once they enter, the match is over... This means that even if principles are "flexibly applied according to specific circumstances," it is too late and useless. The director's coded words and black scenes are so malicious! So despicable!

	The director also uses the workers' mouths to spew poison and say obscene words. The conversation between the "soccer fan driver" and the old lady looking for the doctor is very obscene, and it makes people unable to close their mouths. Just from this conversation, one can see that the author of "The Soccer Fan" is a complete hooligan.

	Ye Bili and three other comrades: In the film, Li Doctor says "Where there is a will, there is a way" three or four times before and after snatching the ticket. The film was shot in 1962, when our country's class struggle was sharp and complex. The overthrown class enemies, unwilling to accept their doom, were stirring. Xu Changlin shouted at this time, "Where there is a will, there is a way," which is obviously a very malicious coded word.

	Zhu Hezong (Beijing No. 13 Bus Driver): There is another scene where Li Doctor comes out from the stadium, climbs over the wall to hang on the trellis, and two security guards come to stop him, one telling him to go up and the other to go down, making Li Doctor unable to go up or down. The director deliberately suggests to people: "blind command" makes people hang in mid-air, not knowing what to do. The director wants to use this method to shadow and attack the party's leadership, which is in vain.

	Li Youyue: The director of the film makes Li Doctor's wife, a bourgeois lady, shout "happiness," "happiness!" "Happiness is over!" on the screen three times. This is a veiled slander that during the three years of temporary difficulties, the people lost their happiness.

	Wang Miaotao and seven other comrades: The director of "The Soccer Fan" still feels that the attack on socialism is not obvious enough, so he uses the microcar to make a fuss. The microcar is the result of our working class following Chairman Mao's words and, under the party's leadership, carrying forward the spirit of self-reliance. We taxi drivers have a new type of transportation tool to serve the people, and everyone is very happy. However, those reactionaries are not satisfied. In "The Soccer Fan," they gather various types of cars from capitalist and revisionist countries to compete with the microcar, making the microcar look ridiculous, with the horn ringing long and annoying the audience. The director here slanders the Great Leap Forward as "not so great," the Great Leap Forward disrupted social order, and made people anxious. This is the same kind of goods as Deng Tuo and his ilk slandering the Great Leap Forward as "a chicken's nest of eggs"!

	Now, people cannot help but ask: what does the author of this big poisonous weed, Xu Changlin, want to do by making such a film?

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Among the intellectuals who harbor hostile attitudes towards our country, there are very few. These people do not like our proletarian dictatorship country; they long for the old society. When they get a chance, they will stir up trouble and try to overthrow the Communist Party and restore the old China." Xu Changlin is this kind of reactionary bourgeois intellectual. One of his weapons to "overthrow the Communist Party and restore the old China" is the film.

	Xu Changlin once put on a fierce appearance and publicly announced: "to use satirical comedy as an important weapon, to launch a fight of laughter, smile, anger, and scolding against the ruling class." This reactionary used the so-called "satirical comedy" poisoned arrow, "The Soccer Fan," to fight against the proletarian dictatorship led by the Communist Party. We must arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought and use the mirror of Mao Zedong Thought to distinguish between flowers and weeds, sweeping away all ghosts and snakes.

	The following words by Comrade Ma Mu'an from Tianjin Chemical Plant can conclude our discussion.

	Smash the "Light and Lively" Soft Knife
	Eradicate All Kinds of Poisonous Weeds

	"The Soccer Fan" is a reactionary film that spreads poison under the banner of "entertainment," "light and lively," and "humorous." It first aims its attack at our working class. We, the working class, are the most revolutionary and conscious class, the leading class of our country, and the locomotive of the revolution. We read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. The Chinese working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought has a lofty revolutionary goal and ideal. We also have our personal hobbies and interests, but our hobbies and interests are based on the needs of the revolution and are consistent with the revolution. Wang Jinxi, the Iron Man of Daqing, is the shining image of our working class. The director of "The Soccer Fan" maliciously defames and attacks our working class, clearly exposing their reactionary faces.

	The film brazenly defames and attacks our great country's great people, attacking our new society. After our country's liberation, we established a socialist country with the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the broad laboring people became the masters of the state. Except for the few ghosts and snakes, that is, the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, the relationship between people has undergone a fundamental change. The people are all comrades, with full democracy and freedom. New social customs and morals have been established. Selflessness, helping others, and doing good deeds are everywhere. Chairman Mao said when talking about the spiritual state of our people, our people have never been so full of vigor and fighting spirit. Chairman Mao enthusiastically praised our people as "spring breeze and willows ten thousand, six hundred million people all like Shun and Yao." However, the director, harboring deep hatred for the party and socialism, describes our society as a capitalist society, with ghosts and snakes and hooligans running wild, and evil winds blowing everywhere. The director openly attacks and defames our socialist society, which is evidence of his anti-party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought.

	"The Soccer Fan" is a big poisonous weed produced under the "firecracker-less" and "heretical" theory of Zhou Yang and Xia Yan, a gang of anti-party elements. Zhou Yang, the leader of the anti-party literary black line, has not publicly advocated making "entertaining works" and "light and lively" works? Xia Yan, the "old man" of the film industry, has not been vigorously promoting making "humorous films"? This extremely reactionary film is a poisonous melon from the black vines of anti-party elements, evidence of their preparation of public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. Whether it is the music design or the lens shooting, "The Soccer Fan" is completely in the style of capitalist and modern revisionist arts, with almost no difference from the films of American imperialism and modern revisionism. These extremely reactionary people want to use the "light and lively" soft knife to kill people, achieving their evil goal of restoring capitalism. We must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "All erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, all ghosts and snakes should be criticized and must not be allowed to spread freely." We must improve our ability to distinguish poisonous weeds in the struggle. For "The Soccer Fan," this big poisonous weed against the party and socialism, we must not let it go and must completely smash it!

　　射向社会主义制度的一支毒箭
    反党文艺黑藤结出的一颗毒瓜
　　——北京、上海、西安、天津工人批判影片《球迷》笔谈会
    编者的话：由徐昌霖编导、上海天马电影制片厂拍摄的电影《球迷》，是在一九六二年出笼的一棵大毒草。
    《球迷》编导者徐昌霖，是蒋家王朝的御用鹰犬，三十年代文艺黑帮的忠实走卒。解放以前，他拍摄过歌颂美蒋特务的《清白家风》等反动影片，在反动报纸《中华时报》当过编辑。解放以后，他又得到电影界黑帮夏衍、瞿白音等人的赏识和重用，继续干着反革命的罪恶勾当。《球迷》就是他反党反社会主义的一个罪证。
    一九六一年以后，当文艺界黑帮总头目周扬、黑帮大将夏衍竭力鼓吹“轻松活泼”的“以讽刺为重要特点”的“喜剧”的时候，徐昌霖便在这股逆流中摇头摆尾，和反党反社会主义分子瞿白音合谋，共同把《球迷》这株毒草培植出笼。影片拍出后，就受到中共上海市委的严厉批评。这伙黑帮费尽心机地要搞这些“喜剧”，有不可告人的目的。他们是笑里藏刀，用“嘻笑”的障眼法，肆无忌惮地丑化工人阶级和劳动人民，丑化社会主义社会，攻击党，攻击无产阶级专政，为资本主义复辟作舆论准备，这就是这伙黑帮的真正目的。
    毛主席说：“你是资产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂无产阶级而歌颂资产阶级；你是无产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂资产阶级而歌颂无产阶级和劳动人民：二者必居其一。”毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级和劳动人民，遵照毛主席的这一教导，就能识破徐昌霖之类的牛鬼蛇神们编造的一切毒草。今天发表的这组稿件，是北京、上海和西安的交通运输工人、天津化工厂工人、北京协和医院医生对《球迷》的批判。
    大家首先最愤慨的是这部影片——
　　猖狂地进攻工人阶级  恶毒地丑化劳动人民
    刘荣、李友月（北京市无轨电车司机）：《球迷》从头到尾都在丑化我们工人阶级。这些反动家伙，把当家作主的工人阶级，歪曲得不像样子。这是我们最气愤的事。电影里的那些“工人”，谈的不是政治，不是工作，不是学习，而是在工作时间内，那么津津有味地回忆上星期一场球赛如何“精彩”。他们谈得最起劲的，除了赛球就是球票。他们的脑子里，就是一个球，什么工作，什么为人民服务，完全丢到九霄云外。从他们的神情和行动看，没有一丝一毫为人民服务的心。在车场里为了一张票，疯疯癫癫地乱窜乱抢；一边开车，一边同乘客聊天；没有看上球，就说：“不看这场球，腿就踩不动汽车的油门。”甚至失魂落魄地把车乱开一气，闯进了游泳场。这完全是美国“垮掉的一代”、流氓阿飞胡闹的事，编导者却别有用心地把它搬到中国来，就是存心用它来污蔑新中国的工人阶级！
    王妙桃、杨连山、华海清、王大太、王顺隆、傅苗发、张贤德（上海出租汽车公司司机）：在我们司机里，也有不少喜欢体育运动的。我们有足球爱好者，乒乓球爱好者，还有爱好田径、游泳等运动的。但这些运动都是业余的，自愿结合的，在班前班后和假期进行的。我们的业余体育活动，有明确的政治目的，这就是培养革命意志，增强身体素质，为了保卫祖国，为生产服务。不少司机既是体育运动的积极分子，又是生产上的能手，更是学习毛主席著作的积极分子。根本不像《球迷》中的司机那样：运动场上是“英雄”，抢球票是“好汉”，在生产上是懒汉，在服务上是“怪物”。这不是恶意的捏造是什么？
    叶碧绿、董英奇、蒋玉玲（北京协和医院医生）：作为革命的医务工作者，我们不能容忍《球迷》编导者丑化医生的形象。新中国的医务工作者是按照毛主席关于“救死扶伤，实行革命的人道主义”的指示，面向广大劳动人民，为工农兵服务的。影片里的李医生，却是一个地地道道的旧社会资产阶级流氓。他身上哪儿有一点社会主义国家白衣战士的味道？他一出场，就叫人讨厌，穿了一身笔挺的衣服，拿了根手杖，陪着他的是一位奇形怪状、娇声娇气的女人。李医生在路上遇到正在买花的孕妇黄秀英，那种眉飞色舞的样子，一点也不像人民医生对待病员的正常态度。随着剧情的发展，李医生更是丑态百出：一见到有人退票就上前猛抢猛夺，把眼镜也砸碎了；当黄秀英母亲来叫李医生接生时，他放着大门不走，竟从球场看台的围墙上一步一步地爬下来，身子吊在藤萝架上摇荡……真是洋相十足，编导者把医生的形象丑化到了无以复加的程度。
    李廷云（北京出租汽车司机）：《球迷》编导者不但丑化了我们工人阶级，也丑化了我们社会主义社会的革命干部和医务工作者，丑化了许多劳动人民。为了一张球票，父亲同儿子抢，同志与同志抢，观众与观众还堵在球场门外抢。一张球票，你争我夺，抢，抢，抢……大家都是只有自己，没有别人，这就是编导者歪曲的中国人民的形象！在编导者恶毒的笔下，我们劳动人民变成了一群除了自己吃喝玩乐，其他什么事都不懂、什么人都不关心的“白痴”。他们活着就是为了看球。事实上，劳动人民是最懂得关心自己的阶级兄弟的。无论何时何地，一事当前，总是先替别人打算，把别人的利益看得特别重。就拿看球来说吧，我们当中也有爱看球赛的人，可是，无论多精彩的球赛，多么难得的球票，我们大家总是互相谦让。有时候，由于大家都让，最后谁也没去。这就是我们工人阶级的高尚风格！我们要质问影片的编导者，这样恶毒地丑化我们劳动人民的形象，究竟安的什么心？
    这位工人同志问得对。《球迷》编导者这样恶毒地丑化伟大工人阶级和劳动人民的形象，究竟安的什么心？
    什么藤结什么瓜，什么阶级说什么话。徐昌霖之流，跟所有反党反社会主义大毒草的制作者一样，对共产党，对工人阶级，对社会主义制度，对无产阶级专政，有刻骨的仇恨。他们的资产阶级反动天堂，被共产党领导下的人民大革命彻底摧毁了，他们再不能骑在劳动人民头上作威作福了，可是他们人还在，心不死，时时刻刻想从人民手里夺回他们的“宝座”。所以，他们就那样恶毒地咒骂和攻击我们整个社会主义社会。工人观众对此非常愤慨，他们以亲身的经历，异口同声地说：
　　新社会无数的新人新风尚
　　驳斥了编导者的无耻污蔑
    孙永禄（北京公共汽车公司干部）：《球迷》的编导者，不光是在抢票的情节上大作文章，有意丑化工人阶级，他还用老太太找医生给女儿接生的情节，全面丑化社会主义社会人与人之间的关系。老太太要求检票员设法把医生从球场找出来，检票员却蛮不讲理地拒绝说：“喇叭一喊，影响球员注意力，踢错了球是你负责还是我负责？”像这样不救人之所急，只考虑责任由谁负的事和人，在我们工人阶级中干脆就没有。我们汽车司机，只要遇到乘客在车上生病或临产，总是想尽办法尽快把病员送到医院。车上的乘客，也都发挥“一人有困难，大家来支援”的风格，有的主动下车改乘别的车，有的还帮助司机和售票员护送病人！这才是社会主义新中国的真实写照。我们决不容许编导者恶毒的捏造！
    西安市交通运输局文化革命战斗小组：十年来，在西安也举办过多次全国性的甲乙级篮球赛。每次比赛，我们交通部门每天有几十辆客车，接送运动员和观众。在大会期间，体育场门外，往来车辆多，司机们都安全礼让，严格遵守“宁等一分，不抢一秒”的安全经验，在交通民警的指挥配合下，往来车辆秩序井然。《球迷》的编导者，把球场内的秩序描绘成一片混乱，乌烟瘴气，把球场外的公共交通车辆，描绘成互争互抢，拥挤不堪，根本不像我们社会主义城市的样子。从银幕上的混乱情况看，倒成了美国的纽约了！
    刘荣：《球迷》这棵毒草中的人物，从老到小，从男到女，没有一个正经的。两个学生为了看球，撒谎说是从外地坐火车赶来的。司机的儿子小立，只有七八岁，可是也跟他发疯的父亲一样，为了看球，饭也顾不得吃，匆匆忙忙走出家门来，每迈一个步子，完全遵照他父亲走过的路子。他父亲从哪棵树绕过去，他也从那儿绕过去。这是编导者恶意地暗示人们：工人阶级堕落了，工人阶级的下一代也是跟着堕落下去了！
    《球迷》的编导，故意用“热闹”和乱哄哄的场面来混淆人们的视线，企图达到污蔑社会主义社会的丑恶目的。他们别有用心地要人们相信，在社会主义社会，工人阶级为了追逐吃喝玩乐，什么阶级友爱，同志之间的关心和帮助，统统都没有了。大家为了一张票，谁也不让谁，争夺得把眼镜都砸碎了。这决不是社会主义的中国，而是资本主义的西方世界！
    我是开十三路无轨电车的，我们这条线路正好经过工人体育场。体育场内举行的活动是频繁的。每次体育活动，我们的车就要接送成千上万观众。这些观众，大部分是工农兵群众和革命干部。他们搭乘我们的车，都很遵守公共秩序。他们对老弱病残和孕妇，都很照顾，主动让座，观众乘客的这些行动，充分体现了我们社会主义社会同志之间的关心和友爱。而我们开车的把观众全部安全送到体育场后，就“人不离车，车不离人”地坚守在工作岗位上，利用等待散场的时间，把车擦洗得干干净净的，以便乘客们在看完比赛后，舒舒服服地坐上我们的车回家去休息。
    《球迷》编导者瞪着眼不看这些事实，偏要把我们新社会污蔑成一团糟，这是因为他们要借此来发泄对新社会的仇恨。我们工人阶级看透了他们的黑心，现在一定要斩断这伙牛鬼蛇神的黑手！
    许多同志都指出：这部影片大肆展览许多资产阶级生活方式、奇装异服、妖形怪状，散布资产阶级、修正主义的毒素。编导者的居心是十分险恶的。他的罪恶目的，就是毒害观众、特别是毒害青年一代的心灵，企图使他们在嘻嘻哈哈的笑声里中了诡计，吞下毒药。
    这些同志说得对：
　　宣扬资产阶级生活方式是毒害观众的糖衣炮弹
    王妙桃等七同志：《球迷》一方面丑化劳动人民，另一方面却精心刻划了一个资产阶级大老板形象。那个“胖球迷”口含雪茄烟，手拿公文包，形容端庄，彬彬有礼。正当一群男女老小球迷们为一张球票闹得神魂颠倒的时候，唯独他在一旁冷眼旁观，不动声色。最后把一张票分文不取，“恩赐”给工人和医生。编导者这样美化资本家，他的反革命嘴脸就一清二楚了。
    贾德义（北京出租汽车司机）：《球迷》编导者用所谓喜剧的手法，堆了一大堆资产阶级的庸俗低级的东西。西服革履，奇装异服，阿飞流氓，吃吃喝喝，全是资产阶级那一套。影片编导者，就是企图让人们在嘻嘻哈哈中不致察觉牛鬼蛇神们的资本主义复辟阴谋。这就是编导者笑里藏刀的险恶居心。
    叶碧绿等三同志：编导者在这部影片里，竭力宣扬腐朽的资产阶级生活方式，尽量在吃喝玩乐上大做文章，镜头里还多次出现奇装异服的阿飞。这些早已霉烂发臭的破烂，都被编导者捡来大力加以宣扬。编导者还把影片中出现的男女老少都描写成球迷。看球就是一切，一切为了看球。一切都围着球转，看球赛、谈论球赛，成了人们生活的唯一目的。他生造这种丑恶的“喜剧”，实际上就是鼓吹邓拓之流所谓“业余时间是第一兴趣广泛驰骋的自由天地”的谬论。它露骨地把人们引向不问政治，只讲吃喝玩乐，追求资产阶级生活方式的道路上去。这是毒害观众的糖衣炮弹，是推行“和平演变”阴谋的重要手法。
    一切反党反社会主义的黑“秀才”，都有一个共同手法，就是大讲黑话。邓拓、吴晗是这样，徐昌霖也不例外。《球迷》和其他毒草影片一样，有许多黑话、黑镜头。它们含沙射影地攻击共产党，攻击社会主义社会，攻击无产阶级专政，处处流露出影片编导者对新中国的敌对情绪。
　　一大堆黑话、黑货、黑镜头暴露了编导者的丑恶灵魂
    孙永禄：《球迷》不但用人物形象来丑化工人形象，还用许多黑话来攻击我们的党和社会主义制度。比如那个球场检票员，开口闭口地在那里大谈“原则性”，“球迷司机”在一旁却边找票边咒骂：“这不是坑人吗？”这是对革命原则性进行露骨的谩骂。最后，虽然检票员“灵活运用原则性”，答应让“球迷”们入场了，可是，进得场来，比赛已经结束……这就是说，即使原则性“根据具体情况灵活运用”，已经迟了，没有用处了。编导者的这套黑话、黑镜头，多么阴毒！多么可恶！
    编导者还借工人的口，大放毒气，乱说下流话。“球迷司机”和找医生的老太太的那一段对话，非常下流，说它都叫人合不上牙。单从这段对话，就可以看出《球迷》的作者是个十足的大流氓。
    叶碧绿等三同志：影片里李医生抢夺球票的前前后后，曾经说过三四次“有志者事竟成”这句话。影片拍摄在一九六二年，当时正是我国阶级斗争尖锐复杂的时期，被推翻了的阶级敌人，不甘心自己的灭亡，正在蠢蠢欲动。徐昌霖在这时候大喊大叫什么“有志者事竟成”，显然是一句极其恶毒的黑话。
    朱和宗（北京十三路公共汽车司机）：还有一个镜头，是李医生从球场内出来时，越墙爬到藤萝架上吊起来，两个纠察赶来干涉，一个要他上去，一个要他下来，弄得李医生上不上，下不下。编导者在这里别有用心地暗示人们：“瞎指挥”使得人吊在半空中无所适从。编导者妄想用这种手法影射和攻击党的领导，这是徒劳的。
    李友月：电影的编导者，让李医生的老婆——资产阶级的少奶奶在银幕上三番五次地喊：“幸福”，“幸福！”“幸福算完了！”这是含沙射影地污蔑在三年暂时困难时期，群众失去了幸福。
    王妙桃等七同志：《球迷》编导者还嫌攻击社会主义攻得不明显，便在微型汽车上借题发挥。微型汽车是我们工人阶级听毛主席的话，在党的领导下，发扬自力更生精神的成果。我们出租汽车工人有了一种新型的为人民服务的交通工具，大家都很高兴。可是那些反动家伙却不满意。在《球迷》里，搜罗了资本主义、修正主义国家各式各样的汽车，来同微型汽车比赛，让微型汽车出洋相，喇叭搭线长鸣，引起观众讨厌。编导者在这里污蔑大跃进“不过如此”，大跃进扰乱了社会秩序，弄得人心惶惶。这同邓拓之流污蔑大跃进是“一个鸡蛋的家当”完全是一路货色！
    现在，人们不禁要问：这株大毒草的作者徐昌霖，搞出这样一部影片，到底想干啥？
    毛主席教导我们：“对于我们的国家抱着敌对情绪的知识分子，是极少数。这种人不喜欢我们这个无产阶级专政的国家，他们留恋旧社会。一遇机会，他们就会兴风作浪，想要推翻共产党，恢复旧中国。”徐昌霖就是这类反动的资产阶级知识分子。他的“推翻共产党，恢复旧中国”的武器之一，就是电影。
    徐昌霖曾经摆出杀气腾腾的架势，公开宣布：要“把讽刺性喜剧”“当作一种重要的武器”，“对统治阶级展开嬉、笑、怒、骂的斗争”。这个反动的家伙就是用《球迷》这个所谓“讽刺性喜剧”的毒箭，来同共产党领导下的无产阶级专政作“斗争”的。我们一定要用毛泽东思想武装自己，用毛泽东思想的照妖镜来辨别香花毒草，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。
    天津化工厂工人马穆安同志下面的一番话，可以为我们这个笔谈会做个结束。
　　砸烂“轻松”的软刀子
　　铲除形形色色的毒草
    《球迷》这部反动的影片，是在“娱乐”“轻松”“滑稽”的招牌下大放其毒的。它把进攻的矛头首先对准我们工人阶级。我们工人阶级，是最革命最有觉悟的阶级，是我国的领导阶级，是革命的火车头。我们读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人阶级，有着崇高的革命目标和革命理想。我们也有自己的个人爱好和兴趣，但是，我们的爱好和兴趣是以革命的需要为前提的，和革命是一致的。大庆铁人王进喜就是我们工人阶级的光辉形象。《球迷》编导者这样恶毒地丑化攻击我们工人阶级，最清楚不过地暴露了他们的反动面目。
    影片放肆地丑化攻击我们伟大国家的伟大人民，攻击我们的新社会。我国解放以后，建立了无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，广大劳动人民成了国家的主人，除了对少数的牛鬼蛇神也就是地富反坏右实行专政外，人与人的关系发生了根本的变化。人民群众都是同志关系，有着充分的民主和自由。树立了新的社会风气，新的社会道德。大公无私，舍己为人、助人为乐的事迹，处处皆是。毛主席在谈到我国人民的精神状态时说，我国人民从来没有像现在这样意气风发，斗志昂扬。毛主席热情地歌颂我国人民是“春风杨柳万千条，六亿神州尽舜尧”。可是，编导者怀着对党对社会主义的刻骨仇恨，把我们的社会描写成资本主义社会，牛鬼蛇神、阿飞流氓到处窜，歪风邪气到处刮。编导者这样明目张胆地攻击丑化我们的社会主义社会，是他反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的明证。
    《球迷》这棵大毒草，是周扬、夏衍这帮反党分子的“反火药味”“离经叛道”论炮制下的产物。周扬这个反党文艺黑线的首领，不是公开宣扬过要搞“娱乐性的作品”，搞什么“轻松”的作品吗？夏衍这个电影界的“老头子”，不是拚命地鼓吹过要多搞“滑稽片”吗？这部极其反动的影片，就是反党黑藤上结出的一颗毒瓜，就是他们为资本主义复辟作舆论准备的罪证。《球迷》这部影片无论是音乐设计，还是镜头摄制，完全都是资本主义、现代修正主义文艺那一套，和美帝国主义、现代修正主义的电影几乎没有什么区别。这些反动透顶的家伙，就是想用“轻松”的软刀子杀人，达到他们搞资本主义复辟的罪恶目的。我们要永远记住毛主席的教导：“凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。”我们要在斗争中提高识别毒草的本领。对于《球迷》这株反党反社会主义的大毒草，我们决不放过，必须彻底把它打倒！
