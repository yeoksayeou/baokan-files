The film "Two Families" was made in 1963. Why was such a film made in 1963? The creators had an ulterior motive. The film depicts events from 1953. In 1953, it was the first year of China's first Five-Year Plan. In the film, Gao Zhengguo also had his own five-year plan. Didn't he say to his daughter, "The country is implementing a Five-Year Plan, and I also have a five-year plan"? What was Gao Zhengguo's five-year plan? To buy land, build a house, open a mill, and in ten years, establish a large farm. From 1953 to 1963, exactly ten years had passed. During this period, our country successfully completed two Five-Year Plans, and the living standards of the broad masses of people improved significantly. Everyone was jubilant over the achievements of socialist revolution and construction. However, the film emphasized the complete failure of the personal "five-year plan" of people like Gao Zhengguo, who wanted to get rich. The creators used a very dark method to hint to the poor and lower-middle peasants: with national interests and collective interests, there can be no personal interests. They attempted to incite the poor and lower-middle peasants and this small clique of anti-Party elements to attack the Party together. This is the most blatant provocation and the most sinister intention.

1963 was an extraordinary year. It was the year when our country successfully overcame severe natural disasters, the national economy was rapidly recovering, and a great situation was emerging. In this year, under Chairman Mao's great call to "never forget class struggle," the country launched a magnificent socialist education movement. It was also in this year that all domestic and foreign monsters and demons became even more frenzied. The film "Two Families" emerged at this time, eager to "break through the door," acting as the vanguard of counter-revolutionaries, waving flags and shouting, launching a fierce attack on the Party and socialism. However, no matter how cunning, treacherous, and hidden you are, your fate will be only one: to be kicked into the garbage heap of history!

    《两家人》摄于一九六三年。为什么在一九六三年要摄制这样的电影呢？编导者有一个不可告人的目的。影片写的是一九五三年的事。一九五三年是我国第一个五年计划的第一年，影片里的高正国也有他自己的一个五年计划。他不是对女儿这样说过吗：“国家要搞五年计划了，我也有一个五年计划。”高正国的五年计划是什么呢？买地、盖房、开粉坊，十年后办成个大农庄。从一九五三年到一九六三年，隔了整整十年。这个期间，我们国家的两个五年计划都胜利完成了，广大人民的生活有了普遍的改善，都为社会主义革命和建设的成就欢欣鼓舞。可是，电影却着重描绘了象高正国那样想发家致富的个人“五年计划”完全破灭了。编导者在这里用十分阴暗的手法向贫下中农暗示：有了国家利益、集体利益，就不可能有个人利益，妄图唆使贫下中农和他们这一小撮反党分子一齐起来向党进攻。这真是最露骨的挑拨和最险恶的居心。
    一九六三年，这是一个不平凡的年头。它是我们国家胜利地战胜了严重的自然灾害，国民经济正在迅速恢复，出现了一片大好形势的一年。在这个年头，全国人民在毛主席的“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大号召下，掀起了一个波澜壮阔的社会主义教育运动。也就在这个年头，一切国内外的牛鬼蛇神变得更加疯狂。电影《两家人》在这时急不可待地“破门而出”，充当反革命分子的马前小卒，摇旗呐喊，对党对社会主义大肆进攻。然而，不管你们多么狡猾、阴险、隐蔽，下场只能是一个：被踢进历史的垃圾堆！
