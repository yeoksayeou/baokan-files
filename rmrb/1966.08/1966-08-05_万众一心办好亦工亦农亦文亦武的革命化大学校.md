The people and military across the nation enthusiastically respond to the great call of Chairman Mao, uniting as one to establish revolutionary schools that are workers, farmers, intellectuals, and soldiers.

The various military branches and military regions have swiftly responded to Chairman Mao's great directive, making arrangements to implement it.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 4th, the people of our country enthusiastically cheer for our most beloved and great leader, Chairman Mao, for his great directive on turning every industry into a revolutionary school that is workers, farmers, intellectuals, and soldiers. They say, Chairman Mao has drawn a blueprint for us to build communism. Every word of Chairman Mao is the truth. Chairman Mao's words are our plans for a hundred years, a thousand years, and ten thousand years. We must strive to realize the great historical task proposed by the Party and Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao's great call reached the Daqing Oilfield, and the broad masses of workers and their families shouted in unison: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Mao Zedong Thought!" They unanimously expressed: Chairman Mao's praise for Daqing is the latest directive and the greatest concern, encouragement, and whip for Daqing. The people of Daqing must remember Chairman Mao's teachings, be humble and prudent, not arrogant or impatient, further learn from the People's Liberation Army, learn from Dazhai, and learn from all advanced units across the country, continuously revolutionize, and strive for greater achievements in the process of turning Daqing Oilfield into a school of Mao Zedong Thought. Zhang Shilin, the team leader of the 1202 Drilling Team, a model unit of the Petroleum Industry Department, said: Daqing Oilfield has developed thanks to Mao Zedong Thought. Every victory in oilfield construction is a glorious victory of Mao Zedong Thought. In the early days of oilfield construction, we used Chairman Mao's "Two Articles" to overcome one difficulty after another. In the recent Cultural Revolution, we used Chairman Mao's class struggle theory to sweep away all ghosts and monsters. Similarly, in production, we fought the production battle as a political battle, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and achieving victory. In the past, a team could only drill one kilometer per month on average, and only ten thousand meters per year. This July, we broke through ten thousand meters in one month. Cai Sheng, the party branch secretary of the First Room of the Oilfield Design Institute, a model worker of the Petroleum Department, said: We follow Chairman Mao's directive that intellectuals must combine with workers and peasants, insisting on going deep into the grassroots to eat, live, and work with the workers, designing together with the workers, and coming up with many great ideas. In the future, we will continue to act according to Chairman Mao's great directive, becoming highly politically conscious, all-around developed communist new people. The families of Daqing said: In recent years, we have followed Chairman Mao's directives, producing oil, farming, and setting up small factories. The families have transformed from consumers to producers. Based on the principle of combining industry and agriculture, urban and rural areas, and benefiting production and convenience, industrial and agricultural villages have been established one after another. In these villages, there are also half-work, half-study and half-farming, half-study schools. The gap between workers and peasants, urban and rural areas is gradually narrowing here. The families' thoughts and spirits are changing, and the relationships between people are changing. New thoughts are growing, a new wind is growing, and a new generation is growing.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in rural people's communes joyfully said that Chairman Mao's directive has given us the great historical task of gradually narrowing the three major gaps and transitioning to communism. We must advance bravely along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao. Sun Guirong, a member of the party branch committee of the North Tower Brigade of the Honghua People's Commune in the suburbs of Yinchuan City, Ningxia, said: Our brigade's seventh production team was originally relatively backward in production. Last year, the brigade party branch secretary organized everyone to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and the community members established the idea of farming for revolution, working together to change the backward face of the production team in one year. This shows that to do well in socialist construction, we must first let Mao Zedong Thought take the lead and cultivate revolutionary people. Now, Chairman Mao calls on us to take agriculture as the main focus, learn other skills, and cultivate us into all-around developed communist new people. We must strive to realize Chairman Mao's great call. Heheng, the commune leader of Shanwang People's Commune in Feidong County, Anhui, said: Our commune has developed commune-run industries since 1962. The agricultural middle school established in 1958 has also been persistently maintained to this day. We have implemented these methods of being workers, farmers, intellectuals, and soldiers, with good results. Since this year, the commune and various production teams have organized cadres and community members to study Chairman Mao's works, and everyone's political and ideological consciousness has greatly improved. We must follow Chairman Mao's directives and turn the commune into a revolutionary school that is workers, farmers, intellectuals, and soldiers.

The broad masses of workers on the financial and commercial frontlines enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's great call, determined to turn financial and commercial enterprises into revolutionary schools. Li Suwen, the deputy political instructor of the Heping Food Store in Shenyang, said: Chairman Mao's latest directive has drawn a magnificent blueprint for us to realize communism. If we turn every industry into a revolutionary school that is workers, farmers, intellectuals, and soldiers, we can cultivate millions of highly politically conscious, all-around developed communist new people. In this way, China's 700 million people will become an iron wall, invincible in the world. No matter in any situation, the enemy's iron shells or "sugar-coated bullets" will all be thoroughly defeated by us.

Many people mentioned that responding to Chairman Mao's call means learning from the People's Liberation Army, being as loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought as the army. The revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of the Jiangxi Communist Labor University said: The eight years of Jiangxi Communist Labor University are eight years of learning from the People's Liberation Army, eight years of inheriting and carrying forward the glorious traditions of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University. Over the past eight years, we have taken Chairman Mao's works as the basic textbooks, prioritized political and ideological education, established farms, forests, factories, gardens, and stores, cultivated a large number of people who are workers, farmers, intellectuals, and soldiers, and sent them to various fronts, receiving warm welcome from the masses. They expressed that in the future, they will further learn from the People's Liberation Army and resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's directives, turning the Communist Labor University into a revolutionary school. Representative Hou Xien, a worker from the Guizhou People's Printing Plant and a squad leader of the militia, said at the National Militia Representatives Conference: We are determined to be like the People's Liberation Army, doing revolution for life, reading Chairman Mao's books for life, and also developing all-around like the army. Zhou Guizhi, a weaver from the First Wool Textile Factory in Lanzhou, said: "We textile workers must also learn Chairman Mao's works like the People's Liberation Army, take Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding direction for all our work, and cultivate ourselves into revolutionary warriors who are workers, farmers, intellectuals, and soldiers."

The revolutionary teachers and students of various schools across the country, who are in the midst of the high tide of the Cultural Revolution, have seriously studied Chairman Mao's directives. They expressed their determination to thoroughly reform the old education system and overthrow the reactionary authority of the bourgeoisie over the schools during the Cultural Revolution. Students from poor and lower-middle peasant families at the Beijing Agricultural Labor University enthusiastically expressed to the Party and Chairman Mao: We will persist in half-work (farm) half-study, definitely take Chairman Mao's works as the basic textbooks, strive to learn and master Mao Zedong Thought, never leave labor, never leave the working people, and swear to be the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. Many revolutionary little generals in middle schools in Guangzhou cheered enthusiastically after seeing Chairman Mao's directive: "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!" The revolutionary little generals of the second class of the second grade of the Third Middle School in the city also wrote a letter to the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, expressing their most resolute and serious execution of Chairman Mao's great directive. They also requested to move the school to the mountains, to the countryside, to the factories, and to the most difficult places.

The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army deeply felt during their study that Chairman Mao's great directive is, was, and will be the fundamental guarantee for our army to march from victory to victory. The predecessor of a certain academy of the Liberation Army in Changsha was established in Yan'an's Nanluwan in 1945.

Over the past twenty-plus years, although the academy has undergone many relocations, it has always maintained and carried forward the glorious tradition of being a fighting team, a work team, and a production team. Many cadets felt: We have done this in the past and have achieved great results. Now, Chairman Mao has set higher requirements for the People's Liberation Army, and we must resolutely implement them. Some old soldiers who participated in the construction of the Dazhengshan Anti-Japanese Base Area in the Inner Mongolia Military Region recalled their past experiences and said: At that time, the Kuomintang reactionaries economically blockaded us, and the Japanese invaders surrounded and divided us, bringing us great difficulties. But we implemented Chairman Mao's directive of "the army being self-sufficient in production," fighting on one hand and producing on the other, overcoming various difficulties, and the troops were well-clothed and well-fed, full of vigor. In dispersed situations, we successfully persisted in the anti-Japanese struggle. Today, as long as we resolutely implement Chairman Mao's directives, our combat effectiveness will be even stronger, and we will be able to better defend our socialist homeland.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 4th, as soon as Chairman Mao's directive on the People's Liberation Army being a great school reached the troops, various military branches, military regions, and military area party committees swiftly responded, convening party committee meetings or expanded party committee meetings to study the directive, discuss its significance, plan the grand blueprint, and formulate measures. They unanimously expressed: We must, with the greatest determination, the greatest willpower, and the greatest enthusiasm, lead the broad masses of soldiers and officers to truly turn the troops into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

During this period, party committee meetings or expanded party committee meetings were held by the Navy, Air Force, and the Beijing, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Fuzhou, Wuhan, Kunming, Jinan, Lanzhou, Chengdu troops, and the Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet Military Regions. At the meetings, old cadres who had fought under Chairman Mao's leadership spoke passionately, discussing for one day after another. The Navy Party Committee meeting, presided over by Political Commissar Su Zhenhua, was held for three consecutive days; at the Air Force Party Committee meeting, Wu Faqian, Yu Lijin, and others studied and discussed seriously with everyone. The third secretary of the Shenyang Military Region Party Committee, Chen Xilian, presided over a lively discussion on significance and measures. The commander of the Tibet Military Region, Zhang Guohua, and the leading cadres concentrated their time to study and discuss repeatedly. After the Inner Mongolia Military Region held a party committee meeting, they immediately convened an expanded party committee meeting to fully carry forward democracy and discuss thoroughly.

At the party committee meetings of various troops, the great significance of Chairman Mao's directive was first seriously discussed. It was unanimously pointed out: Chairman Mao's directive is a very important directive with historical significance, a new development of Marxism-Leninism, and a brilliant creation. It is a fundamental measure to prevent revisionism, gradually narrow the three major gaps, and gradually transition to communism. It is a fundamental measure to accelerate the extremely proletarian and extremely combat-ready nature of our army. It is the most practical and effective fundamental measure to strengthen war preparedness. By acting according to Chairman Mao's directive, we can better build our country of 700 million people into the "Yan'an of the world revolution." It can also ensure that our army, whether in peacetime or wartime, truly becomes a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, cultivating and creating millions of communist new people, making greater contributions to the Chinese revolution and the defense of East Asia and world peace.

How to lead the soldiers to turn the troops into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought was fully discussed by the party committees of various troops. They pointed out: To lead the soldiers to turn the troops into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, the party committee members must first study and apply Chairman Mao's works, take the lead in transforming their subjective world. Only in this way can they truly take the lead in implementing Chairman Mao's directives. Currently, in addition to studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, taking the lead in transforming the subjective world, insisting on fighting against the purely technical viewpoint, the purely professional viewpoint, and one's own wrong thoughts, it is more important to take participating in the Cultural Revolution as a major combat task, thoroughly eliminating the bourgeois black line and thoroughly purging the pernicious influence of the bourgeois military line.

    全国军民热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召
    万众一心办好亦工亦农亦文亦武的革命化大学校
    解放军各军种兵种和各军区党委闻风而动纷纷部署贯彻毛主席伟大指示
    据新华社四日讯　我国各地人民热烈欢呼我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席关于把各行各业都办成亦工亦农、亦文亦武的革命化的大学校的伟大指示。他们说，毛主席为我们建设共产主义的伟大事业画出了蓝图。毛主席的话句句是真理。毛主席的话，就是我们的百年大计、千年大计、万年大计。我们一定要为实现党和毛主席提出的这个伟大历史任务而奋斗。
    毛主席的伟大号召传到大庆油田，广大职工和家属同声欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛泽东思想万岁！”他们一致表示：毛主席对大庆的表扬，就是对大庆的最新指示和最大的关怀，最大的鼓舞，最大的鞭策。大庆人一定要牢记毛主席的教导，谦虚谨慎，不骄不躁，进一步向解放军学习，向大寨学习，向全国一切先进单位学习，不断革命，在把大庆油田办成毛泽东思想大学校的过程中争取更大的成绩。石油工业部五好标兵单位、一二○二钻井队队长张石琳说：大庆油田就是靠毛泽东思想发展起来的。油田建设的每个胜利，都是毛泽东思想的光辉胜利。油田建设初期，我们用毛主席的“两论”战胜了一个又一个的困难。在最近的文化大革命中，我们用毛主席阶级斗争的学说，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。同样在生产上，我们把生产仗当政治仗打，不怕牺牲，排除万难，夺取胜利。过去一个队平均一个月只能钻一千米，一年不过钻一万米，今年七月份一个月我们就突破了一万米。石油部五好标兵、油田设计院一室党支部书记蔡升说：我们按照毛主席关于知识分子必须和工农兵结合的教导，坚持深入基层和工人同吃、同住、同劳动，和工人一起搞设计，搞出了很多的大名堂。今后，我们要继续按照毛主席的伟大指示办事，做一个有高度政治觉悟、全面发展的共产主义新人。大庆家属们说：这几年我们按照毛主席指示，又搞油，又种地，还办起了小型工厂，家属从消费者变成生产者。本着工农结合、城乡结合，有利生产、方便生活的矿区建设方针，工农村一个又一个地办了起来。在工农村里，还有半工半读、半农半读学校。工农差别、城乡差别在我们这里逐渐缩小。家属的思想感情和精神面貌在变化，人与人之间的关系在变化。新的思想在成长，一代新风在成长，一代新人在成长。
    广大农村人民公社的贫农下中农社员欢欣鼓舞地说，毛主席的这个指示，向我们提出了逐步缩小三大差别、向共产主义过渡的伟大历史任务，我们一定要沿着毛主席指引的方向奋勇前进。宁夏银川市郊红花公社北塔大队党支部委员孙桂英说：我们大队第七生产队原来生产比较落后，去年，大队党支部书记组织大家活学活用毛主席著作，社员们树立了为革命种田的思想，齐心协力在一年里就改变了生产队的后进面貌。这说明，要搞好社会主义建设，首先要毛泽东思想挂帅，培养出革命化的人。现在，毛主席号召我们以农为主，兼学别样，把我们培养成全面发展的共产主义新人，我们一定要为实现毛主席的伟大号召而奋斗。安徽省肥东县山王人民公社社长荚衡说，我们公社从一九六二年起，发展了社办工业。一九五八年办的农业中学，也一直坚持到了现在。我们实行了这些亦工亦农、亦文亦武办法，效果很好。今年以来，公社和各生产队普遍组织干部和社员学习毛主席著作，大家的政治思想觉悟大大提高。我们一定要遵照毛主席的指示，把公社办成一个亦工亦农、亦文亦武的革命化大学校。
    各地财贸战线上的广大职工，热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召，决心把财贸企业办成革命化的大学校。沈阳市和平副食品商店副政治指导员李素文说：毛主席的这一最新指示，给我们画出了实现共产主义的宏伟壮丽的蓝图。我们各行各业都办成亦工亦农、亦文亦武的革命化的大学校，就可以培养出有高度政治觉悟的、全面发展的亿万共产主义的新人。这样，我国七亿人民就成了坚如磐石的铜墙铁壁，无敌于天下。无论在任何情况下，阶级敌人的钢铁炮弹也好，“糖衣炮弹”也好，都将被我们彻底打败。
    许多人谈到，响应毛主席的号召，就要向解放军学习，要象解放军那样最忠实于毛主席，最忠实于毛泽东思想。江西共产主义劳动大学的革命师生员工说，江西共产主义劳动大学的八年，是学习解放军的八年，是继承和发扬抗大光荣传统的八年。八年来，我们以毛主席著作为基本教材，把政治思想教育摆在首位，办了农场、林场、工厂、园艺场、商店，培养出大批亦工亦农、亦文亦武的人材，输送到各个战线，受到了群众的热烈欢迎。他们表示，今后要进一步学习解放军，坚决按毛主席的指示办事，把共产主义劳动大学办成革命化的大学校。出席全国民兵代表大会代表、贵州人民印刷厂工人、基干民兵排长侯希恩说：我们决心要象解放军那样，干一辈子革命，读一辈子毛主席的书，也要象解放军那样全面发展。兰州第一毛纺织厂织布女工周桂芝说：“我们纺织工人也要象解放军那样，努力学好毛主席著作，把毛泽东思想当作我们各项工作的指导方向，把自己造就成亦工亦农、亦文亦武的无产阶级革命战士。”
    正处在无产阶级文化大革命高潮中的各地大、中学校的革命师生，认真地学习了毛主席的指示。他们表示一定要在无产阶级文化大革命中，彻底改革旧的教育制度，推翻反动的资产阶级“权威”对学校的统治。北京农业劳动大学贫农下中农家庭出身的学生，满怀激情地向党和毛主席表示：一定把半工（农）半读坚持下去，一定要以毛主席著作为基本教材，努力学习和掌握毛泽东思想，永远不脱离劳动，永远不脱离劳动人民，誓做无产阶级革命事业的接班人。广州市许多中学的革命小将看到毛主席的指示后热烈欢呼：“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”市三中高二（二）班的革命小将并且向中共广州市委写信，表示最坚决、最认真地执行毛主席这一伟大指示。他们还要求把学校迁到山区去，迁到农村去，迁到工厂去，迁到最艰苦的地方去。
    人民解放军的指战员们在学习中，深深感到毛主席的这一伟大指示，过去、现在和将来，都是我军从胜利走向胜利的根本保证。长沙解放军某学院的前身，是一九四五年在延安南泥湾建立的。
    二十多年来，尽管学院经过多次迁移，但一直保持和发扬了既是战斗队，又是工作队和生产队的光荣传统。许多学员体会到：我们过去这样做了，已经取得很大成绩。现在毛主席又对解放军提出了更高的要求，我们一定要坚决贯彻执行。内蒙古军区曾经参加过建设大青山抗日根据地的一些老战士，回忆过去的经历时说，那时候国民党反动派从经济上封锁我们，日本侵略军分割包围我们，给我们带来了很大的困难，但我们贯彻了毛主席“军队生产自给”的指示，一面作战，一面生产，胜利地克服了各种困难，部队丰衣足食，生气勃勃，在分散情况下胜利地坚持了抗日斗争。今天，我们只要坚决贯彻毛主席的指示，战斗力就将更加强大，就能更好地保卫我们的社会主义江山。
    据新华社四日讯　毛主席关于人民解放军应该是一个大学校的指示一下达到部队，各军种、兵种和各军区党委闻风而动，纷纷召开党委会或党委扩大会，学指示，谈意义，摆宏图，订措施，一致表示：要以最大的决心，最大的毅力，最大的干劲，带领广大指战员把部队真正办成一个毛泽东思想的大学校。
    这期间，召开党委会或党委扩大会的有海军、空军，有北京、沈阳、广州、南京、福州、武汉、昆明、济南、兰州、成都部队和内蒙古、新疆、西藏军区。会上，在毛主席领导下南征北战的老干部们，满怀激情地讲了一次又一次，谈了一天又一天。海军党委会会议在政治委员苏振华的主持下连续举行了三天；空军党委会上，吴法宪、余立金等同大家一起认真学习，反复讨论。沈阳部队党委第三书记陈锡联主持的党委会上，委员们谈意义、订措施，讨论得十分热烈。西藏军区司令员张国华和领导干部们一起集中时间，反复进行学习和讨论。内蒙古军区开过党委会后，紧接着又召开了党委扩大会充分发扬民主，反复进行深入讨论。
    各部队党委会上，首先认真地讨论了毛主席指示的伟大意义。一致指出：毛主席的这一指示，是一个极为重要的具有历史意义的指示，是马克思列宁主义划时代的新发展，是天才的创造。它是反修防修，逐步缩小三大差别，逐步向共产主义过渡的根本措施，是加速我军非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的根本措施，是最切实、最有效地加强战备的根本措施。按照毛主席的这一指示去办，就可以把我们这个七亿人口的大国，更好地建设成“世界革命的延安”；就可以保证我们军队不论在平时还是战时，都真正成为一个毛泽东思想的大学校，培养和造就千千万万个共产主义新人，对中国革命、保卫远东和世界和平作出更大的贡献。
    怎样才能带领指战员把部队办成毛泽东思想的大学校，各部队党委都作了充分的讨论。他们指出：要带领指战员把部队办成毛泽东思想的大学校，首先是党委成员要活学活用毛主席著作，带头改造主观世界，只有这样，在贯彻毛主席指示时，才能真正带好头。当前，除了要活学活用毛主席著作，带头改造主观世界，坚持与单纯技术观点斗，与单纯业务观点斗，与自己的错误思想斗以外，更要把参加无产阶级文化大革命当作重大的战斗任务，彻底搞掉资产阶级的黑线，彻底肃清资产阶级军事路线的恶劣影响。
