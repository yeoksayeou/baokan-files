The secretary-general of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau, Mr. Senanayake, said at a welcoming banquet hosted by the vice mayor of Shanghai that Chairman Mao is the teacher of the world's revolutionary people. The various conspiracies of the Soviet revisionists have alienated them from the Afro-Asian writers and people.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Shanghai dated August 1, Vice Mayor Liang Guobin of Shanghai hosted a grand banquet on the evening of July 31 to warmly welcome foreign friends attending the emergency meeting of Afro-Asian writers.

At the banquet, Mr. Senanayake, secretary-general of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau, strongly condemned the Soviet revisionists' various destructive activities aimed at splitting the Afro-Asian writers' movement. He said: The destructive activities of the Soviet revisionists and splitters have exposed themselves as the destroyers and splitters of the great Afro-Asian people's revolutionary movement in front of the Afro-Asian revolutionary people and writers. He declared: Due to the various conspiracies of the Soviet revisionists and splitters, they have alienated themselves from the Afro-Asian writers and people, and they will never again be members of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau.

He said: We Afro-Asian writers and people respect Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is the teacher of the revolutionary people of the whole world. We highly respect Mao Zedong Thought because Mao Zedong Thought provides the revolutionary people of the whole world with correct political guidance. Chairman Mao and the support of the Chinese people are the most reliable guarantee for the oppressed and enslaved people to carry out revolutionary struggles and a great encouragement for the people of the world to carry out revolutionary struggles.

He said: The decision of the emergency meeting of Afro-Asian writers to hold the third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference in China is very correct. The Chinese people are fully qualified to accept such trust. He called on Afro-Asian writers to work closely together to ensure the greater success of the third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference.

The banquet was filled with a spirit of unity against imperialism and warm friendship. Shanghai writers and advanced figures from various fronts gathered with foreign friends from various countries and regions of Asia and Africa, celebrating new victories in the anti-imperialist struggle of the Asian and African peoples.

Liang Guobin spoke at the beginning of the banquet, representing the people of Shanghai in extending a warm welcome to the representatives of various Asian and African countries visiting Shanghai, and to Mr. Senanayake, secretary-general of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau, and his wife for their visit to Shanghai, joining the Asian and African writers and people of Shanghai.

Liang Guobin, in his speech, expressed firm support for the struggle of the Vietnamese people against American aggression and for national salvation. He said that the flames of the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the Asian and African peoples are indomitable by American imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries.

Secretary-General Senanayake, in his speech, sincerely thanked the people of Shanghai for their warm welcome to the Afro-Asian writers and himself.

He said that due to reasons beyond his control, he could not personally attend the emergency meeting of Afro-Asian writers, but he had been receiving reports on the meeting in Colombo and learned that the meeting had achieved great success. The meeting raised the banner of revolution against imperialism and neo-colonialism, old and new, and promoted solidarity among Afro-Asian writers and peoples.

He cited facts to expose the Soviet revisionists' splitting of the Afro-Asian writers' movement and sabotage of the Afro-Asian writers' emergency meeting. He pointed out that the emergency meeting of Afro-Asian writers held in Beijing was the result of full consultation and was supported by the majority of member countries of the Permanent Bureau. However, the Soviet revisionists and splitters actually denied the necessity of holding an emergency meeting of Afro-Asian writers in Beijing to support the struggle of the Vietnamese people and openly obstructed it. He said that their adoption of such an attitude was not surprising. As early as 1963, after the executive committee of the Afro-Asian Writers' Conference was held in Bali, Indonesia, the leadership of the Soviet Writers' Union began to openly attack the Permanent Bureau and sent representatives and emissaries to Colombo to try to persuade him, the secretary-general of the Permanent Bureau, to acknowledge the correctness of revisionism. At that time, he represented you—my dear colleagues, and the Afro-Asian peoples, to resolutely resist them. Before this emergency meeting of Afro-Asian writers, they again sent someone with a proposal to see him, asking whether the venue of the emergency meeting of Afro-Asian writers could be moved to another country. He replied to them at the time that the majority of the fighting writers and peoples of Asia and Africa demanded that the meeting be held in Beijing, and it would definitely achieve the success of the meeting. Soon after, they plotted a disruptive and illegal meeting in Cairo and "dismissed" him from his post as secretary-general of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau at the meeting. He announced: They do not have such power; only you—Afro-Asian writers present here have the power to dismiss me or retain me, because you represent the revolutionary Afro-Asian writers and peoples.

He strongly condemned the heinous crimes of American imperialism, the number one enemy of the people of the world, in invading Vietnam. He said that the Asian and African peoples and writers have recognized that the attainment of national liberation and freedom is to be achieved through a resolute struggle against imperialism, while the accomplices of imperialism believe that freedom can be obtained through round-table talks. The struggle of the Vietnamese people has fully proven that this view is completely wrong. He said that the Chinese people support the struggle of the Vietnamese people and the struggle of the peoples of various Asian and African countries, proving to the people of the world that their support will not stop until American imperialism is eliminated from the face of the earth, and this is the reason why the Asian and African peoples have deep respect for the Chinese people.

Secretary-General Senanayake also spoke about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in China. He said that the Chinese people have taken great strides in the Great Cultural Revolution, which is a new stage of the socialist revolution in China. I am paying close attention to your new achievements in this regard with great concern.

    亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克在上海市副市长的欢迎宴会上说
    毛泽东主席是世界革命人民的导师
    苏联修正主义者的种种阴谋活动，使他们自绝于亚非作家和人民
    据新华社上海一日电  上海市副市长梁国斌三十一日晚上举行盛大宴会，热烈欢迎出席亚非作家紧急会议的外国朋友。
    亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克在宴会上讲话，他强烈谴责苏联修正主义者分裂亚非作家运动的种种破坏活动。他说：苏联修正主义者、分裂主义者的破坏活动，在亚非革命人民和作家的面前，暴露出他们自己是伟大的亚非人民革命运动的破坏者和分裂者。他宣布：由于苏联修正主义者、分裂主义者的种种阴谋活动，使他们自绝于亚非作家和亚非人民，他们永远不再是亚非作家常设局的成员。
    他说：我们亚非作家和人民尊敬毛泽东主席，毛泽东主席是全世界革命人民的导师，我们非常尊敬毛泽东思想，因为毛泽东思想给予全世界革命人民以正确的政治指导。毛主席和中国人民的支持是被压迫被奴役的人民进行革命斗争的最可靠的保证，是世界人民进行革命斗争的巨大鼓舞力量。
    他说：亚非作家紧急会议作出在中国召开第三届亚非作家会议的决定，这是非常正确的。中国人民完全有资格接受这样的信任。他要求亚非作家们亲密合作，以保证第三届亚非作家会议取得更大的成功。
    宴会上洋溢着团结反帝、热烈友好的气氛，上海作家和各条战线上的先进人物，同来自亚非各国各地区的外国朋友欢聚一堂，共祝亚非人民反帝斗争取得新的胜利。
    梁国斌在宴会开始时讲话，他代表上海人民，热烈欢迎亚非各国代表访问上海，热烈欢迎亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克和夫人光临上海，同亚非作家和上海各界人士欢聚。
    梁国斌在讲话中表示坚决支持兄弟的越南人民的抗美救国斗争，他说，亚非人民反帝革命斗争的怒火，是美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派所扑灭不了的。
    森纳那亚克秘书长在讲话中衷心感谢上海人民给予亚非作家和他本人的盛情欢迎。
    他说，由于他本人所不能控制的原因，不能亲自参加亚非作家紧急会议，但是他在科伦坡经常收到有关会议的报道，了解到这次会议取得了很大的成功。会议高举反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的革命旗帜，促进了亚非作家和人民之间的团结。
    他列举事实，揭露苏联修正主义者分裂亚非作家运动和破坏亚非作家紧急会议，他指出，在北京召开的亚非作家紧急会议是经过充分协商，得到常设局绝大多数成员国的赞同和支持的。但是，苏联修正主义者、分裂主义者竟然否认在北京举行亚非作家紧急会议支持越南人民斗争的必要性，公开出面阻挠。他说，他们采取这样的态度并不奇怪。早在一九六三年，在印度尼西亚巴厘岛举行亚非作家会议执行委员会后，苏联作家协会的领导集团就开始公开攻击我们常设局，并且派了代表和使者到科伦坡来企图说服我这个常设局秘书长承认修正主义的正确性。我当时代表你们——我亲爱的同事们，代表亚非人民，坚决地抵制了他们。在这次亚非作家紧急会议召开之前，他们又派人带了一个建议来见我，说亚非作家紧急会议的集会地点是否可以从北京搬到另一个国家去。我当时回答他们，亚非绝大多数的战斗作家和人民要求在北京召开这次会议，而且一定会取得会议的圆满成功。在这之后不久，他们就在开罗策划了破坏性的、非法的会议，并且在会上“罢免”了我的亚非作家常设局秘书长的职务。我宣布：他们没有这种权力，只有你们——在座的亚非作家们，才有权罢免我或者留下我，因为你们代表革命的亚非作家和亚非人民。
    他强烈谴责全世界人民的头号敌人美帝国主义侵略越南的滔天罪行。他说，亚非人民和亚非作家都认识到，救国、民族解放和自由的取得，是要通过对帝国主义的坚决斗争的，而帝国主义的合谋者却认为，自由可以通过圆桌会议来取得。越南人民的斗争充分证明，这个观点是完全错误的。他说，中国人民支持越南人民的斗争，支持亚非各国人民的斗争，向全世界人民证明：在全世界地面上消灭美帝国主义之前，他们的支持是不会停止的，这就是亚非人民对中国人民怀着深厚的尊敬的原因。
    森纳那亚克秘书长还谈到最近正在中国开展的无产阶级文化大革命。他说，中国人民在伟大的文化大革命中迈开了巨大的步伐，这是中国社会主义革命的一个新阶段。我以非常关心的心情注意着你们在这方面所取得的新成就。
