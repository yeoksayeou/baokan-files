Farmers Must Also Criticize the Bourgeoisie

Jiangsu Taicang County, Shaxi Commune, Hongjing Brigade poor peasant female commune member Gù Ātáo

Chairman Mao teaches us: Farmers must also criticize the bourgeoisie. Chairman Mao is right, he spoke to our hearts, and we must follow his words.

In the old society, we farmers, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants, were oppressed and exploited by the class enemies to the extreme. After liberation, Chairman Mao led us to overturn our situation and walk the path of socialism, and in the future, we will advance towards communism. The happy days are like sesame flowers blooming higher and higher. Thinking of the past, looking at the present, and envisioning the future, we are truly happy, and even in our dreams, we smile. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao are the lifeline for our poor people to stand up, and the lifeline for the happiness of our descendants for generations to come.

We are happy, but the class enemies are resentful. Their property has been confiscated by us, but the reactionary thoughts in their minds cannot be confiscated. They never forget the days of exploitation, like the green onions in June, the leaves are withered, the roots are rotten, but their hearts do not die, and they hate our socialism. Recently, during the Cultural Revolution, we exposed a landlord who attempted to reverse the situation. He wrote down in a book every piece of land and property that was redistributed during the land reform, to whom it was given, and how many acres and fractions, planning to settle accounts with us in the future. Chairman Mao said: "After the enemies who carry guns are eliminated, the enemies who do not carry guns still exist, and they will inevitably fight to the death with us. We must not underestimate these enemies." These words are absolutely true. Now, as our socialist revolution advances step by step, this group of landlords and bourgeois elements sees that they are becoming more and more powerless, and in their final struggle, they cannot openly sabotage, so they secretly sabotage. When military sabotage fails, they use cultural sabotage. Like the group of anti-party, anti-socialist elements exposed during this Cultural Revolution, they use the pen to attack us, plotting a comeback. We study Chairman Mao's works, and they call us "vulgarization," "simplification," "pragmatism," opposing us reading Chairman Mao's books. We educate the youth to be hardworking and thrifty, but they spread bourgeois lifestyles to corrupt the youth. We want to watch plays about workers, peasants, and soldiers heroes, but they perform ancient costumes plays about emperors, generals, talents, and beauties. We want students to study well and work well, but they want them to study hard and not work. We want to improve collective production, but they say it's better to get rich individually. In short, they oppose everything. If we are not clear-headed and sharp-eyed, we will fall for their tricks and suffer a second time. These enemies who do not carry guns are more cunning and vicious than those who do.

The old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits that exist among the masses are the poisons left by the bourgeoisie. If we do not criticize the bourgeoisie and get rid of these old things, we will not be able to build socialism and advance towards communism. We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions and thoroughly defeat the bourgeoisie. We must always remember class struggle, always remember the dictatorship of the proletariat, always remember to emphasize politics, always remember to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and resolutely fight to the end with the landlords and the bourgeoisie.

The best weapon to criticize the bourgeoisie is Mao Zedong Thought. To master Mao Zedong Thought, we must study Chairman Mao's books well. Chairman Mao's books are the best books in the world, and they are the magic weapon for us to stand up and make a revolution. In the past, I did not know these truths, thinking that since I am illiterate, I cannot study; that I am old and should not study; that farmers do not need to study. Later, comrades educated and helped me, and I slowly began to study. Once I read Chairman Mao's books, I completely changed. My eyes became sharper, and I could tell good people from bad; my ears became more sensitive, and I could tell good words from bad; my mind became clearer, and I could distinguish socialism from capitalism; my thoughts became better, and my selfish heart was replaced with a red heart. We must definitely study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively. If we are illiterate, we should listen with our hearts, remember with our minds, and ask with our mouths. The older we are, the more we should revolutionize and study; farmers should farm for the revolution and must study. We must definitely study hard like Comrade Liu Yingjun. I think that as long as millions of farmers study Chairman Mao's works, the capitalist roots of these bad elements can be completely uprooted, our socialist country will be secure, and communism will come.

    农民也要批判资产阶级
    江苏太仓县沙溪公社洪泾大队贫农女社员　顾阿桃
    毛主席教导我伲（我们）：农民也要批判资产阶级。他老人家讲得对，讲到了我伲心里，我伲一定要照着去做。
    在旧社会里，我伲农民，特别是贫下中农，被阶级敌人压迫、剥削的苦透苦透。解放后，毛主席领导我伲翻了身，走上了社会主义道路，今后还要走向共产主义，幸福日子象芝麻开花节节高。想想过去，看看现在，望望将来，心里实在高兴，困梦头里也要笑起来。共产党、毛主席是我伲穷人翻身的命根子，是我伲子孙万代幸福的命根子。
    我伲心里高兴，阶级敌人心里恨。他们的财产被我伲没收了，但脑子里的反动思想没法没收。他们一直勿忘记过去的剥削生活，象六月里的葱，叶焦根烂心不死，恨我伲社会主义。最近在文化大革命中，我伲就揭发出来一个妄图变天的地主，他把土改辰光分脱（掉）的田，分脱的财产，分给那一家，几亩几分，都一笔一笔写在一本通书上，想今后向我伲算账。毛主席讲：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。”这话是千真万确的。现在我伲社会主义革命一步一步朝前发展，这批地主、资产阶级分子看看他们越来越不行了，临死还要挣扎，明的破坏勿来事（不行），就暗里破坏，武的破坏勿来事，就用文的破坏。象这次文化大革命中揭发出来的一帮反党反社会主义分子，就是用笔杆子向我伲进攻，阴谋复辟。我伲学习毛主席著作，他们骂我伲是“简单化”“庸俗化”“实用主义”，反对我伲读毛主席的书。我伲教育青年人要艰苦朴素，他们却散布资产阶级的一套生活毒害青年。我伲要看看工农兵英雄人物的戏，他们却演帝王将相、才子佳人的古装戏。我伲要学生读书好、劳动好，他们却要死读书，勿要劳动。我伲要搞好集体生产，他们就讲个人发家好。总之，他们样样事体（事情）反敲锣。如果我伲头脑不清，眼睛不尖，就会上他们的当，重新吃第二次苦头，这些不拿枪的敌人比拿枪的敌人更狡猾更凶恶。
    现在群众中存在着的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，就是资产阶级留下来的毒素。我伲勿批判资产阶级，勿弄脱这些旧东西，就勿能建设社会主义，走向共产主义。我伲一定要照毛主席的指示去做，彻底打倒资产阶级。我伲要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决同地主、资产阶级斗争到底。
    批判资产阶级顶顶好的武器，就是毛泽东思想。要掌握毛泽东思想，就要好好读毛主席的书。毛主席的书，是世界上顶顶好的书，是我伲翻身闹革命的法宝。以前我勿晓得（不知道）这些道理，认为我不识字，勿能学；年纪老不要学了；种田人学了也用不着。后来同志们教育我，帮助我，才慢慢学起来了。我一读毛主席的书，完全变了样，眼睛变得尖了，好人坏人分得清了；耳朵变得灵了，好话坏话听得出了；脑子变得清了，社会主义、资本主义辨得明了；思想变得好了，私心换上了红心。我伲一定要活学活用毛主席著作，不识字就用心听，用脑记，用嘴问。年纪老，越老越要革命，越要学习；种田人，要种田为革命，就要学习。一定要象刘英俊同志那样，努力学习。我想，只要千千万万农民都学习毛主席著作，这些坏家伙的资本主义老根就能挖干净，我伲的社会主义江山就有保证，共产主义就会到来。
