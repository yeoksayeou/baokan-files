The Permanent Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Writers' Bureau was officially established in Beijing today. This marks another significant milestone in the history of the Afro-Asian Writers' Movement following the Emergency Conference of Afro-Asian Writers.

The Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Writers' Bureau, S. Nananayakkara, read out the "Communiqué on the Establishment of the Executive Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Writers' Bureau" at the establishment ceremony, formally announcing the establishment of the Executive Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Writers' Bureau in Beijing today.

Nananayakkara also read out the "Statement by the Afro-Asian Writers' Bureau on the Further Splittist Activities of the Soviet Revisionists," strongly condemning the Soviet revisionists' plot to convene a splittist conference in Baku and their attempt to deceive people with the American "peace talks" ploy, further splitting the Afro-Asian Writers' Movement and betraying the anti-imperialist struggle of the Afro-Asian peoples.

The Executive Secretariat was established in accordance with the "Resolution on Strengthening the Afro-Asian Writers' Movement" adopted at the Emergency Conference of Afro-Asian Writers held in Beijing and the decision made at the Bureau's meeting on July 12, 1966, to set up the Executive Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Writers' Bureau in Beijing. The Executive Secretariat will immediately begin its work to assist in implementing the decisions of the Emergency Conference of Afro-Asian Writers and the Bureau, and to prepare for the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference to be held in China.

The communiqué states: "In the spirit of the Emergency Conference of Afro-Asian Writers, the Bureau calls on all Afro-Asian writers to fully support and assist the Bureau and the newly established Executive Secretariat, to ensure the great success of the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference, to heighten vigilance, strengthen unity, and actively participate in the struggle of the Afro-Asian peoples, to repel and smash the splittist activities of the imperialists led by the United States and their lackeys, and the chief accomplice, the Soviet revisionists, and to achieve final victory."

Attending the establishment ceremony were representatives from member countries of the Afro-Asian Writers' Bureau in Beijing, some representatives who participated in the Emergency Conference of Afro-Asian Writers in Beijing, representatives from various countries who left the 12th World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs in Tokyo to uphold the glorious traditions of the movement and arrived in Beijing, and other foreign friends.

Also present were representatives from the Asia and Pacific Peace Committee, the Afro-Asian Journalists Association, the Patriotic Front of Thailand, the Malayan National Liberation League, the Palestine Liberation Organization, and other organizations stationed in Beijing.

The Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Writers' Bureau, S. Nananayakkara, held a reception tonight to celebrate the establishment of the Executive Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Writers' Bureau in Beijing.

Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the Chinese People's Association for Afro-Asian Solidarity Liao Chengzhi, President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries Chu Tunan, and other relevant leaders attended the reception at the invitation.

At the reception, Nananayakkara proposed a toast, saying that today is a memorable day in the history of the Afro-Asian Writers' Movement. After the establishment of the Executive Secretariat, all arrangements will be made to ensure the greater success of the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference. He hoped that friends would cooperate with, assist, and guide the work of the Executive Secretariat. He said that they would further strengthen the unity and friendship between Afro-Asian writers and peoples until final victory is achieved.

He proposed a toast to the victory of the struggle of Afro-Asian writers and peoples against imperialism, against old and new colonialism, and against revisionism, to the great Cultural Revolution currently underway in China, and to the great political leadership provided by Chairman Mao Zedong to the struggles of the oppressed peoples of the world.

Liao Chengzhi spoke at the reception, saying that today's establishment of the Executive Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Writers' Bureau has sounded the death knell for the splittist conference that the Soviet revisionist leadership is attempting to convene in Baku. He said that the Afro-Asian Writers' Unity Movement is breaking through all difficulties, overcoming stormy waves, and advancing with each wave higher than the last.

Liao Chengzhi said that since this year, the Afro-Asian Writers' Unity Movement has made tremendous progress. He pointed out that the Emergency Conference of Afro-Asian Writers held in Beijing was a victory of world significance; the Secretary-General of the Bureau, Nananayakkara, and his wife braved all difficulties to come to China and joined writers from various Afro-Asian countries in Shanghai, which was another victory; the establishment of the Executive Secretariat of the Bureau under the personal chairmanship of Secretary-General Nananayakkara was another great victory.

Today, the members of the Bureau and all the comrades of the Executive Secretariat, together with friends who left the Tokyo World Conference to uphold the glorious traditions of the movement against atomic and hydrogen bombs and raised the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism, gathered together, which was another great victory. He said that these victories have dealt heavy blows to the heads of American imperialism in Washington and the revisionist heads in Moscow.

He said, "Let us revolutionary Afro-Asian writers unite, make further progress in the Afro-Asian Writers' Unity Movement, and make new contributions to the great unity of the revolutionary peoples of the world."

For upholding the glorious traditions of the movement against atomic and hydrogen bombs and leaving the Tokyo World Conference, the Colombian friend Samper also proposed a toast at the reception, saying that the establishment of the Executive Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Writers' Bureau in China has special significance. China is currently undergoing an unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, a revolution led by the true leader of all revolutionaries in the world, the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Mao Zedong. He expressed his belief that all truly revolutionary writers and intellectuals in Latin America would regard the victories of their Afro-Asian comrades as their own victories and would support them. Samper called on truly revolutionary writers in Latin America to regard Afro-Asian revolutionary writers as comrades and to fight against common enemies.

At the end of the reception, Nananayakkara enthusiastically raised his glass and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the 700 million people of great China!"

Also attending the reception were representatives from member countries of the Afro-Asian Writers' Bureau in Beijing, some representatives who participated in the Emergency Conference of Afro-Asian Writers, representatives from various countries who left the Tokyo World Conference and arrived in Beijing, and other foreign friends in Beijing.

    执行书记处是根据在北京召开的亚非作家紧急会议所通过的《加强亚非作家运动的决议》以及一九六六年七月十二日常设局会议关于在北京设立亚非作家常设局执行书记处的决定而成立的。执行书记处将立即开始它协助完成亚非作家紧急会议和常设局的决定以及筹备在中国召开第三届亚非作家大会的工作。
    公报说：“根据亚非作家紧急会议的精神，常设局号召所有亚非作家全力支持和协助常设局以及新成立的执行书记处，使第三届亚非作家大会获得巨大成功，提高警惕，加强团结，并积极投入亚非人民的斗争，回击和粉碎以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗和头号帮凶苏联修正主义者的分裂活动，取得最后胜利。”

    他提议为亚非作家和人民的反对帝国主义、反对新老殖民主义、反对修正主义斗争的胜利，为中国今天正在进行的伟大的文化大革命，为毛泽东主席对全世界被压迫人民的斗争所给予的伟大政治领导而干杯。
    廖承志在招待会上致词，他说，今天亚非作家常设局执行书记处的成立，是对苏联修正主义领导集团企图在巴库召开的亚非作家分裂会议敲起了葬礼的丧钟。他说，亚非作家团结运动正在冲破一切困难，战胜惊涛骇浪，一浪高过一浪地向前推进。
    廖承志说，今年以来，亚非作家团结运动取得了巨大的进展。他指出，在北京召开的亚非作家紧急会议是一个具有世界意义的胜利；常设局秘书长森纳那亚克和夫人冲破一切困难来到中国，在上海同亚非各国作家汇合在一起，又是一个胜利；在森纳那亚克秘书长亲自主持下成立了常设局执行书记处，又是一个巨大胜利。
　　今天常设局的成员和执行书记处全体同志，同维护禁止原氢弹世界运动光荣传统而退出东京世界大会的高举反帝、反修旗帜的朋友聚会，又是一个巨大胜利。他说，这些胜利都给予了华盛顿美国帝国主义头子和莫斯科修正主义头子以沉重的打击。
