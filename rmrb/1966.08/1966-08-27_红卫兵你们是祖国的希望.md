Red Guards, you are the hope of the motherland!

Revolutionary young heroes—Red Guards, we salute you! You are the vanguards of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the foremost fighters in sweeping away all monsters and demons. Your hearts are red and your eyes are bright; you love to listen to Chairman Mao's words. You are rebels and critics of the old world, inheriting and carrying forward the glorious traditions of the old revolutionary forerunners. You are the successors of the proletarian revolution, the most loyal and bravest Red Guards of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao!

On August 18th, this happiest day for hundreds of millions of people, our most beloved great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao received you and took a photo with you. This is the greatest glory, greatest happiness, and greatest pride for you—Red Guards. Chairman Mao said, "Firmly support your revolutionary rebellion," which is the greatest trust, greatest encouragement, and greatest expectation for you.

Revolutionary young heroes—Red Guards, you have firmly responded to the call of Comrade Lin Biao and, under the command of the great commander Chairman Mao, launched a total attack on the bourgeoisie and all exploitative class ideologies. Under your spirit of daring to venture, daring to act, daring to make revolution, and daring to rebel, the revolutionary people of Beijing first launched a struggle against all the old thoughts, old cultures, old customs, and old habits left over from the old society. They thoroughly cleaned out the old shop signs, old street names, and other outdated customs, and completely buried these filthy things that have been ruling and corrupting people's souls for thousands of years.

Dear comrades, revolutionary young heroes—Red Guards, you are right, you have done well! Your revolutionary rebellious spirit has inspired the revolutionary people and brought great joy to their hearts. It has swept away the arrogance of the bourgeoisie, making them unable to rise again.

Revolutionary young heroes—Red Guards, you are the young people nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, the future and hope of the motherland. We wish you great victories in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought!

Revolutionary young heroes—Red Guards, we firmly support your revolutionary rebellious actions. We are determined to learn from you, and we pay you our warmest respects!

Soldiers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, Luo Wenyi, Zhang Benqi

    八月十八日，这个亿万人最幸福的日子，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席接见了你们，并同你们在一起照了像。这是你们——红卫兵的最大光荣、最大幸福和最大自豪。毛主席说，“坚决支持你们”的革命造反，这是对你们的最大信任，最大鼓舞和最大期望。
    革命的小将——红卫兵，你们坚决响应了林彪同志的号召，在伟大统帅毛主席的指挥下，向资产阶级和一切剥削阶级思想发动了总攻击。在你们——红卫兵的敢闯、敢干、敢革命、敢造反精神的影响下，北京市革命人民首先向旧社会遗留下的一切旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯展开了搏斗。把商店的旧字号，街道的旧称呼等陈规陋习来个彻底大扫除，把这些几千年来统治和腐蚀人们灵魂的肮脏东西斩草除根，彻底埋葬。
    亲爱的同志啊，革命的小将——红卫兵，你们做得对，做得好！你们的革命造反精神使革命的人民受到鼓舞，大快人心。使资产阶级的威风扫地，使他们永不能翻身。
