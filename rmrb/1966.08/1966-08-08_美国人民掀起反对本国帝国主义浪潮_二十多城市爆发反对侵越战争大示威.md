The slogans against American aggression in Vietnam resounded once again across the United States on August 6. On this day, more than twenty major cities, including the capital Washington, turned the activities commemorating the 21st anniversary of the "Hiroshima Day" (the day when American imperialism used the atomic bomb to massacre the people of Hiroshima) into large-scale demonstrations against the U.S. aggression in Vietnam.

In Washington, about 3,000 people (the vast majority of whom were young) held a demonstration in front of the White House. Many flags of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam fluttered in the wind among the marching crowd. The demonstrators held up signs with slogans such as: "Bring the troops back immediately!" "Hey, hey, Johnson! How many boys did you kill today?" "Immediately stop Johnson's war against humanity, impeach him!" Some demonstrators also held a demonstration outside the church where Johnson's daughter was having her wedding ceremony. To deal with the public demonstration, the Washington authorities mobilized four to five hundred police and military personnel, stationed guards all around the White House, and had helicopters hovering overhead, as if facing a major enemy.

In New York, the largest city in the United States, more than 26,000 demonstrators held a massive march and protest rally. The procession surged from the black neighborhood, the workers' neighborhood, and other residential areas towards the "Times Square" in the city center. They held up signs against the Vietnam War, with slogans such as: "We do not allow the Hiroshima incident to repeat! Immediately stop the Vietnam War!" and so on. A large-scale protest rally was held on the square. Peace activist A.J. Muste emphasized in his opening remarks that the anti-war movement among the American people is growing stronger; the protest movement among American soldiers is also expanding, and many American youths who have been drafted are refusing to participate in the Vietnam War. The meeting also read a letter from three American soldiers who were sentenced to prison for refusing to go to South Vietnam to fight, expressing their determination to continue the struggle. After the meeting, the attendees split up to demonstrate in front of the offices of several factories producing napalm, and engaged in a head-to-head struggle with a small group of reactionary elements who came to cause trouble. On the same day, there were also demonstrations in front of the United Nations headquarters, and a petition was handed to the representative of U.N. Secretary-General U Thant, condemning the U.S. for its criminal war in Vietnam.

In San Francisco, nearly 10,000 people held a march and rally against the Vietnam War. The demonstrators expressed their opposition to both the barbaric bombing of Hiroshima 21 years ago by the United States and the current bombing of North Vietnam. At the same time, a group of demonstrators ended their 18-day silent protest in front of a napalm factory.

In addition, demonstrations were also held in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Buffalo, Portland, Cleveland, Boston, and other cities. It was announced that demonstrations would continue on August 7 and 8 in Oakland, Midland, and other cities.

    美国人民掀起反对本国帝国主义浪潮
    二十多城市爆发反对侵越战争大示威
    新华社七日讯　反对美国侵略越南的口号声六日再一次响彻了美国全境。在这一天，包括首都华盛顿在内的二十几个重要城市把为纪念“广岛日”（即美帝国主义用原子弹屠杀广岛人民的日子）二十一周年而举行的活动变成了反对美国侵越战争的大规模示威。
    在华盛顿，大约三千名群众（其中绝大多数是青年）在白宫前面举行了示威。许多面越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜在游行的队伍中迎风飘扬。示威者举着的标语牌上写着：“把（美国）军队立即撤回来！”“嘿，嘿，约翰逊！你今天又杀死了多少小伙子？”“立即制止约翰逊对人类进行的战争，弹劾他！”部分示威者还在约翰逊女儿举行婚礼仪式的教堂外面举行了示威。为了对付群众的示威，华盛顿当局出动了四、五百名军警，沿着白宫四周布满了岗哨，直升飞机也在头顶盘旋，如临大敌。
    在美国第一大城市纽约，两万六千多名示威者举行了声势浩大的游行和抗议集会。示威行列从黑人区、工人区和其他居民区涌向纽约市中心的“时报广场”。他们举着反对侵越战争的标语牌，上面写着：“我们不许广岛事件重演！立即制止越南战争！”等口号，在广场上举行了大规模的抗议集会。和平人士马斯特在开幕词中强调，美国人民的反战运动正在日益壮大；美国士兵中间的抗议运动也在不断扩大，许多应征入伍的美国青年拒绝参加侵越战争。会上还宣读了三名因为拒绝去南越作战而被判刑的美国士兵致大会的一封信，表示他们坚持斗争的决心。会后，与会群众分头到几家生产凝固汽油弹的工厂办事处门前举行示威，并同一小撮前来捣乱的反动分子进行了针锋相对的斗争。同一天，在联合国总部门前也有群众举行示威，并向联合国秘书长吴丹的代表递交了一份请愿书，谴责美国在越南进行罪恶战争。
    在旧金山，近一万名群众举行了反对侵越战争的游行和集会。示威者表示，既反对二十一年前美国对广岛的野蛮轰炸，也反对今天美国对越南北方的轰炸。在这同时，一批示威者结束了他们在一家凝固汽油弹工厂外面举行的持续十八天的沉默示威。
    另外，在洛杉矶、费城、布法罗、波特兰、克利夫兰、波斯顿等城市也都分别举行了示威。据宣布，七日和八日在奥克兰、密德兰等城市还将继续举行示威。
