The Chinese people are prepared to resolutely support Vietnam in fighting the Americans to the end

General Vo Nguyen Giap says that strong support from China is a great encouragement to the Vietnamese people

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 1 — The Chinese military attaché in Vietnam, Chen Hao, held a reception on the evening of July 31 in Hanoi to enthusiastically celebrate the 39th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

Attendees included: Politburo member of the Vietnamese Labor Party, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense General Vo Nguyen Giap, Deputy Minister of Defense Chen Xian, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the People's Army Ly Quang Dao, Ly Quang He, President of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association Huang Guoyue, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Nguyen Khac Thiem, Chairman of the National Unity Commission Nguyen Van Hung, and Chairman of the Hanoi Municipal Administrative Committee Chen Weixing, among others.

Chinese Ambassador to Vietnam Zhu Qifeng, Representative of the Economic and Trade Office Cao Yanxing, and envoys and military attachés from various countries in Vietnam also attended the reception.

Chen Hao and General Vo Nguyen Giap both spoke at the reception.

General Vo Nguyen Giap, in his speech, first extended his warmest congratulations to all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and tempered in the revolutionary war, has now become a powerful revolutionary army with high political awareness and modern weapons. The Vietnamese people and army are proud to have such heroic comrades as the Chinese People's Liberation Army and are greatly inspired and encouraged by the glorious achievements of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He sincerely wished the Chinese People's Liberation Army more and more great victories in all aspects.

Vo Nguyen Giap, when talking about the combat camaraderie between the armed forces of China and Vietnam, said that in the past war against French colonialism and in the current struggle for socialist construction and anti-American resistance, the Vietnamese people have continuously received the great sympathy, support, and assistance full of proletarian internationalism from the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the fraternal Chinese people and People's Liberation Army. The tremendous support and assistance from China, as well as China's vigorous efforts to fully and timely transport the aid materials from other fraternal socialist countries to Vietnam, have made important contributions to strengthening our powerful anti-war force to defeat the American aggressors.

He said that recently, in the face of the extremely serious new "escalation" actions of the American aggressors in the war of aggression, Chairman Ho Chi Minh called on the entire military and people of Vietnam to advance bravely, defeat the American aggressors, and at the same time issued a partial mobilization order. Chairman Ho's call and partial mobilization order correctly reflect the wishes of the entire Vietnamese people and have been enthusiastically responded to and actively implemented by the military and people nationwide.

Vo Nguyen Giap said that the statement by Chairman Liu Shaoqi, the telegram by Zhu De, the statement by the Chinese government on July 3, and the rallies and demonstrations by tens of millions of Chinese people in support of the Vietnamese people have once again shown the enthusiastic support of the Communist Party of China, the National People's Congress, the Chinese government, the Chinese people, and the People's Liberation Army for the Vietnamese people. This strong support is a great encouragement to the Vietnamese people and army who are engaged in the sacred cause of resisting the Americans and saving the country.

Vo Nguyen Giap pointed out that in the face of the savage crimes of the American aggressors in escalating the war of aggression against Vietnam and their vicious plots, Chairman Ho Chi Minh's historic call on July 17 is the ironclad response of the entire Vietnamese people. Chairman Ho said: Johnson and his lackeys must understand: they can send 500,000, 1,000,000, or even more troops to strengthen their aggression against South Vietnam. They can use thousands of planes to intensify their bombing of North Vietnam. But they will never shake the iron will and determination of the heroic Vietnamese people to resist the Americans and save the country. The more vicious they are, the greater their crimes. The war can last five years, ten years, twenty years, or even longer. Hanoi, Haiphong, and other cities and enterprises may be destroyed, but the Vietnamese people will not be intimidated! Nothing is more precious than independence and freedom. When the day of victory comes, our people will rebuild our country even more magnificently and splendidly!

He said that for the entire Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call is the sacred call of the motherland. In response to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call, our 31 million people from south to north are united as one, resolutely advancing until we achieve the final victory.

Chen Hao, in his speech, talked about the great achievements of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing politics, and actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in all aspects of work.

Chen Hao enthusiastically praised the Vietnamese people for, under the wise leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and Chairman Ho Chi Minh, displaying the powerful might of people's war and creating a great revolutionary situation in Vietnam. He said that Chairman Ho Chi Minh, on July 17, on behalf of the 31 million Vietnamese people, issued a stirring proclamation to the world, which is a powerful blow to the U.S. imperialists' "bombing for peace" plot. It is also a blow to the ghosts and demons who conspire with U.S. imperialism to create a "peace" deception.

Chen Hao said that the Chinese people have made up their minds and prepared in all aspects to take actions deemed necessary by the peoples of China and Vietnam at any time and place to jointly strike the American aggressors. No matter where the American aggressors want to expand the war, no matter what the cost, we will firmly and unshakably support and aid the Vietnamese people to the end until the Vietnamese people achieve final victory.

The reception was filled with the fighting friendship between the peoples and the two heroic armies of China and Vietnam.

    我驻越使馆武官举行招待会热烈庆祝“八一”建军节
    中国人民做好了准备坚决援越抗美到底
    武元甲大将说中国强有力的支援是对越南人民的巨大鼓舞
    新华社河内一日电　中国驻越南大使馆武官陈皓七月三十一日晚上在河内举行招待会，热烈庆祝中国人民解放军建军三十九周年。
    出席招待会的有：越南劳动党中央政治局委员、政府副总理兼国防部长武元甲大将，国防部副部长陈森少将，人民军总政治局副主任黎光道少将、黎光和少将，越中友好协会会长黄国越，外交部副部长阮基石，国家统一委员会主任阮文咏，河内市行政委员会主席陈维兴等。
    中国驻越南大使朱其文，经济代表处代表曹言行以及各国驻越南的使节、武官等也出席了招待会。
    陈皓武官和武元甲大将在会上相继讲了话。
    武元甲大将在讲话中首先向中国人民解放军全体干部和战士表示最热烈的祝贺。他说，以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的、经过革命战争熔炉锤炼过的中国人民解放军，现在已经成为一支有着高度政治觉悟和现代化武器的强大的革命军队。越南人民和人民军为有着象中国人民解放军这样的英雄战友而感到无比自豪，对于中国人民解放军所取得的辉煌成就感到无限欢欣鼓舞，并衷心祝愿中国人民解放军在各方面取得更多的日益巨大的胜利。
    武元甲在谈到中、越两国人民和武装力量的战斗团结情谊时说，在过去抗击法国殖民主义者的战争中和在今天建设社会主义和抗美救国斗争事业中，越南人民不断地得到中国共产党、中国政府、兄弟的中国人民和人民解放军的充满无产阶级国际主义精神的极其巨大的同情、支持和援助。中国的极其巨大的支持和援助，以及中国大力地把其他兄弟的社会主义国家的援助物资充分和及时地转运给越南，已经为增强我们战胜美国侵略强盗的强大抗战力量作出了重要贡献。
    他说，最近，面对着美国强盗在侵略战争中的极其严重的新的“升级”行动，胡志明主席号召越南全国军民英勇前进，战胜美国侵略强盗，同时他还公布了局部动员令。胡主席的号召和局部动员令正确地反映了越南全体人民的愿望，得到全国军民的热烈响应和积极执行。
    武元甲说，刘少奇主席的声明、朱德委员长的电报、中国政府七月三日的声明和数以千万的中国人民声援越南人民的集会和游行示威，再一次说明了中国共产党、全国人民代表大会、中国政府、中国人民和人民解放军对越南人民的热情支援。这种强有力的支持是对正在进行抗美救国神圣事业的越南人民和人民军的一个巨大鼓舞。
    武元甲指出，面对美国强盗正在加紧扩大侵越战争的野蛮罪行，面对它的恶毒阴谋，胡志明主席七月十七日的历史性号召是越南全体人民钢铁般的回答。胡主席说：约翰逊和他的走狗必须懂得：他们可以出动五十万、一百万或者更多的军队来加强对越南南方的侵略战争。他们可以使用成千架飞机来加强对越南北方的轰炸。但是，他们绝不能动摇英雄的越南人民抗美救国的钢铁意志和决心。他们越是凶恶，罪恶就越大。战争可以延长五年、十年、二十年或者更长的时间，河内、海防和其它一些城市、企业可能被摧毁，但是越南人民是不会被吓倒的！没有什么能比独立、自由更为宝贵的了。在胜利的日子到来的时候，我国人民将重新把自己的祖国建设得更加堂皇，更加壮丽！
    他说，对于全体越南人民来说，胡志明主席的号召就是祖国的神圣召唤。响应胡志明主席的号召，我们从南到北的三千一百万人民，万众一心，坚决前进，直到取得最后胜利。
    陈皓武官在讲话中谈到了中国人民解放军高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，在各项工作中取得的伟大成就。
    陈皓热烈赞扬越南人民在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的英明领导下，发挥了人民战争的强大威力，打出了越南的大好革命形势。他说，胡志明主席于七月十七日代表三千一百万越南人民向全世界发出的气壮山河的文告，是对美帝国主义“以炸迫和”阴谋的一个迎头痛击。对于那些同美帝国主义合谋制造“和谈”骗局的牛鬼蛇神，也是当头一棒。
    陈皓说，中国人民已下定了决心，做好了各种准备，随时随地采取中越两国人民认为必要的行动，共同打击美国侵略者。不管美国侵略者要把战争扩大到什么地方，不管要付出多大代价，我们都将坚定不移地支持和援助越南人民打到底，直到越南人民取得最后胜利。
    招待会充满了中、越两国人民和两支英雄军队之间的战斗友情。
