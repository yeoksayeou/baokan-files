The People's Liberation Army enthusiastically responds to Chairman Mao's call to deeply study his great directive

Establish Mao Zedong Thought Schools to Train Millions of Revolutionary Successors

Tianjin, Harbin, and Shaoshan in various industries are determined to advance in the direction of becoming revolutionary schools that are both industrial, agricultural, cultural, and military.

A report from our newspaper: Our most beloved leader Chairman Mao recently issued the great directive that "the People's Liberation Army should be a great school." This directive has greatly inspired all the officers and soldiers of the PLA. The entire army enthusiastically responds, deeply studies, widely propagates, and immediately takes action to establish our army as a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Upon hearing Chairman Mao's instructions, all officers and soldiers are overjoyed and excited, raising their arms in celebration:

Long live Chairman Mao!

Ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!

The land, sea, and air forces, various branches, and academies, after receiving this extremely important directive from Chairman Mao, the party committees and leading cadres at various levels first conducted serious study. Then, the leading cadres at the regimental level and above went deep into the companies, airfields, ships, high-altitude outposts, border islands, and personally expounded Chairman Mao's instructions to the officers and soldiers, organizing study and discussion. The Guangzhou Military Region's certain regiment even specially dispatched a propaganda team to climb mountains and cross rivers to propagate to the remote duty squads. Companies generally held report meetings, experience-sharing meetings, wall newspapers, and performances, using various methods to vigorously propagate Chairman Mao's instructions. The comrades of the "Model Company for Loving the People" in a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region said with great emotion: Chairman Mao is truly so wise and great! Chairman Mao's instructions have set higher standards for the construction of our army, and every word and sentence have struck our hearts. The officers and soldiers of the "Steel Eighth Company of the South China Frontier" guarding the southern gate of the motherland said with deep gratitude: Our great leader Chairman Mao cares so much about the construction of the army, which is our greatest happiness!

Through repeated and in-depth study, the broad masses of officers and soldiers have broadened their horizons and opened their minds, deeply realizing that Chairman Mao's instructions are extremely important and historically significant, a new development of Marxism-Leninism, and a brilliant creation. It is a fundamental measure to prevent revisionism, gradually eliminate the three differences, and guide our country towards communism. It is a fundamental measure to accelerate the extremely proletarian and extremely combat-ready nature of our army. It is a fundamental measure to most effectively and practically strengthen preparedness. At the expanded meeting of the party committee of the Nanjing Military Region, everyone unanimously agreed: By following Chairman Mao's instructions, we can meet the expectations of the people of the world and build this country of 700 million people into a "world revolutionary Yan'an" even better. The comrades participating in the study and discussion meeting of the senior cadres of the Jinan Military Region excitedly said: Chairman Mao's great call is a verdict against imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries, and a heavy blow to all ghosts and demons against the party, against socialism, and against Mao Zedong Thought. Many comrades in a certain unit of the Railway Engineering Corps said: Chairman Mao sees far, thinks deeply. Chairman Mao sees the victory of communism in the world, thinks of the long-term plans for generations, centuries, millennia, and ten thousand years. The comrades in the leadership organ of a certain unit of the Kunming Military Region reviewed the glorious traditions of our army and realized that turning our army into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought can make one army serve as several: it is the main force to defend our socialist revolution and socialist construction, support the world revolution, propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and propagate the excellent traditions of our party and army. It is also the vanguard of the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation.

Turning our army into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought can better implement Chairman Mao's military line and thoroughly eliminate the influence of the bourgeois military line. Many comrades recalled the history of our army's struggles over the past few decades and deeply felt: turning the army into a great school is Chairman Mao's consistent military thought. As early as the initial period of our army's establishment, Chairman Mao pointed out that our army is a revolutionary political task force, and stipulated that fighting, doing mass work, and raising funds are the three major tasks of our army. Later, according to the development of the situation, it was clearly stipulated that our army is always a fighting force, a working force, and a production force. For thirty-nine years, our army has resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's military line and built a new type of people's army armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Now, Chairman Mao has issued the great directive that "the People's Liberation Army should be a great school." This is, in the new period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, a summary of our army's military experience and the experience of the world revolutionary struggle, a great development of the theory of proletarian dictatorship and military construction. The comrades in a certain unit of the Inner Mongolia Military Region believe: with this overall direction and overall program, our army will definitely advance faster along the path of being extremely proletarian and extremely combat-ready. Representative Yang Fengqi, political commissar of the military department of Leibo County, Sichuan Province, attending the active participants' meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's Southwest Bureau to study Chairman Mao's works, said at a symposium: "History has proven that only by turning our army into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought can we better implement Chairman Mao's military thought and carry out Chairman Mao's military line. If we do not do this, we will slide onto the bourgeois military line, causing our army to deviate from proletarian politics, deviate from the working and peasant masses, and lose its combat effectiveness."

Turning our army into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought can better promote the thought revolution of officers and soldiers and train millions of highly politically aware, all-around developed proletarian revolutionary successors. Zhang Shaoli, the commander of a certain regiment of the Chengdu Military Region, expressed: "I will study Chairman Mao's books in this great school of Mao Zedong Thought, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions to be a good soldier of Chairman Mao. Standing on the plateau, looking at the world, serving the Chinese people and the people of the world wholeheartedly, and resolutely maintaining the integrity of a proletarian revolutionary in his later years." Liu Yuxiang, an active participant in studying Chairman Mao's works in a certain unit, said: "We young people must strive to reform ourselves in this great school to take over the baton of Mao Zedong Thought and take over the baton of the proletarian revolutionary cause, and resolutely carry the proletarian revolution to the end." Some young intellectuals in the 6410 unit, after studying and discussing, deeply felt that being able to study, live, and fight in this great school is the greatest happiness. They expressed their determination to the party: they must temper their thoughts, temper their will, and temper a pair of hands that can change the world, and temper a pair of shoulders that can bear the heavy burden of the world revolution. The broad masses of officers and soldiers in the Tibet Military Region stationed on the ice-capped mountains made a vow: we will nurture more heroes and excellent successors who can build a new socialist Tibet and defend the sacred borders of the motherland under the nurturing of great Mao Zedong Thought. The cavalry regiment of a certain unit of the Lanzhou Military Region, the Fourth Engineering Brigade of the Shenyang Military Region, a certain unit under the General Logistics Department, and the Xinjiang Military Region stationed on the Pamir Plateau and the Karakoram Mountains all sent articles and letters expressing their determination: they must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, carry out a thorough thought revolution, be heroes in battle, be skilled laborers in farming, be advanced producers in industry, and be the most accurate and fierce proletarian revolutionaries in criticizing the bourgeoisie. They must make sure that the gun is in the hands of the revolutionary successors trained in this great school, so that the Central Committee of the Party, Chairman Mao, and the broad masses of workers and poor peasants can be a hundred times, a thousand times, and ten thousand times at ease!

Chairman Mao's books are the most fundamental compulsory courses in this great school of our army. The three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation are the living classrooms of this great school. The entire army is implementing Chairman Mao's instructions, launching a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Various military branches and services have adjusted the proportion of military and political training time according to their own situations, increasing the time for studying Chairman Mao's works. Various units regard participating in the socialist cultural revolution as the current major combat task. In this sharp and complex class struggle, the broad masses of officers and soldiers are more consciously studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to angrily expose the crimes of the anti-party, anti-socialist black gang and thoroughly criticize all ghosts and demons. Many units have carried out discussions on the implementation of emphasizing politics, further eliminating the influence of the bourgeois military line. Everyone also combines the current international situation, deeply studies Chairman Mao's discussions on the nature of imperialism, further strengthens the concept of preparedness, closely watches the aggressive actions of American imperialism in Vietnam and around our country, and is ready to accept any combat tasks given by the party and the people at any time.

According to the Xinhua News Agency, August 2nd: Chairman Mao's great call for all industries to become revolutionary schools that are both industrial, agricultural, cultural, and military has greatly inspired the workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary intellectuals, and all Communist Party members in Tianjin, Harbin, and Shaoshan. People have expressed their determination to draw endless strength, wisdom, and courage from Chairman Mao's wise instructions and strive to accomplish the historical task proposed by the party and Chairman Mao.

After Chairman Mao's instructions reached Tianjin, they greatly inspired the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary workers on all fronts. They said, by following Chairman Mao's instructions, we can greatly enhance the proletarian consciousness of the Chinese people, promote the thought revolution of the people, and thus accelerate the socialist construction of our country and more quickly eliminate the social and ideological foundations of capitalism and revisionism. They enthusiastically discussed how to first implement Chairman Mao's instructions on themselves. The famous innovator, worker Si Baotong of the Tianjin Shoe Factory, said, according to Chairman Mao's instructions, being a revolutionary worker is not enough to just be an innovator in production. One should first be an innovator in class struggle and a revolutionary innovator. Workers should be like the PLA, able to use a hammer to work, a hoe to farm, a rifle to fight the enemy, and a pen to write articles criticizing the old world and fighting against class enemies. Only in this way can we always stand unshakable, overcome any difficulties, and defeat any powerful enemies. Only in this way can we train and cultivate a revolutionary industrial army that highlights Mao Zedong Thought, and only in this way can we defend the socialist mountains and rivers. Representative Lu Shan of the National People's Congress, an active participant in studying Chairman Mao's works in Hebei Province, and the steel reinforcement team of Tianjin Construction Components Factory No. 1, said, after the previous phase of the proletarian cultural revolution, now studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, my heart is even brighter, and I understand it more intimately and deeply. This instruction is the strongest ideological weapon to prevent the emergence of revisionism and oppose revisionism, and to prevent the restoration of capitalism. Chairman Mao teaches us workers to take work as the main focus, learn military, political, and cultural knowledge, and also criticize the bourgeoisie. We construction workers are doing just that according to Chairman Mao's instructions. During the proletarian cultural revolution, our steel reinforcement team of thirty-five workers, each determined to be a critic of the old world, picked up pens and wrote more than forty critical articles, giving a powerful response to the anti-party, anti-socialist black gang's counter-revolutionary words and deeds. Worker Mu Xiuzhen of Tianjin Food Factory No. 1 said, by following Chairman Mao's instructions, we can make the working people knowledgeable, and the intellectuals laborious, becoming a new generation of communists.

The broad cadres and workers on various fronts in Harbin enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call. Labor model of Heilongjiang Province and Harbin City, Wang You of the first workshop of Harbin Electrical Machinery Factory, said: Chairman Mao has shown us the bright path to building communism. By following Chairman Mao's instructions to manage factories, our country will gradually narrow the three differences and will quickly become revolutionary. If all industries follow Chairman Mao's instructions, our revolutionary cause will prosper even more, and we can make greater contributions to the world revolution. Party Committee Secretary Ma Zongyu of Xinfa Commune in Binjiang District, after studying Chairman Mao's instructions, said, since the establishment of the people's commune, Xinfa Commune has followed Chairman Mao's instructions, taken agriculture as the main focus, and developed forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries comprehensively, achieving great results. Currently, agricultural income accounts for half of the total income, and the other half comes from forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and self-operated factories. However, we are still far from Chairman Mao's requirements for people's communes to also learn military, political, and cultural knowledge and criticize the bourgeoisie. We must learn from the PLA, study military, political, and cultural knowledge well, and make every commune member become a new-type farmer who is both literate and martial. He said, Chairman Mao's wise and great instructions are the guarantee for gradually narrowing the three differences, gradually transitioning to communism, and ensuring that our country will never change color. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions to turn the people's commune into a revolutionary school like the PLA.

The cadres and commune members of Shaoshan Commune, Chairman Mao's hometown in Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, are determined to build Shaoshan according to Chairman Mao's great thought. After learning about Chairman Mao's instructions, the commune party committee immediately held an expanded meeting to seriously study and discuss. The commune party committee, based on Chairman Mao's teachings that "commune farmers should take agriculture as the main focus (including forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries), also learn military, political, and cultural knowledge. When conditions permit, also set up some small factories collectively, and also criticize the bourgeoisie," made preliminary arrangements for the entire commune's agriculture, industry, forestry, animal husbandry, military, political, and cultural learning, etc. Among them, it is especially emphasized that the active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works must be placed at the top of all work. This is the fundamental foundation for turning Shaoshan into a revolutionary school that is both industrial, agricultural, cultural, and military. Shaoshan School, based on Chairman Mao's great call to "shorten the school system and revolutionize education," decided to change the current school system and implement half-farming and half-studying. They are determined to turn Shaoshan School into a revolutionary school that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Now, various production brigades in Shaoshan Commune have held meetings for party members, league members, poor and lower-middle peasants, and active participants who have studied at the commune party school to seriously study and discuss Chairman Mao's instructions. The commune, with this group of people as the core, organized nearly a thousand propaganda teams throughout the commune to propagate to the broad masses of commune members in the fields and to propagate while implementing and taking action.

After hearing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, a certain unit of the Tibet Military Region immediately took active action. This is the advanced team of a certain unit that went to the countryside to engage in agricultural and sideline production, posting a wall newspaper at the construction site to express their determination to respond to Chairman Mao's great call.

    解放军各部队热烈响应深入学习毛主席伟大号召
    办好毛泽东思想大学校　造就千百万革命接班人
    天津哈尔滨韶山各行各业决心向亦工亦农亦文亦武的革命化方向前进
    本报讯　我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席最近发出的“人民解放军应该是一个大学校”的伟大号召，极大地鼓舞了解放军全体干部战士。全军上下，热烈响应，深入学习，广泛宣传，立即行动，决心办好我军这个毛泽东思想的大学校。    广大干部战士听到毛主席的指示，无不欢欣鼓舞，兴奋异常，激动得振臂欢呼：
    毛主席万岁！
    毛主席万万岁！
    陆海空军各部队、兵种、院校，接到毛主席这一极为重要的指示以后，各级党委和领导干部首先进行了认真的学习。接着，团以上领导干部纷纷深入到连队，深入到机场、舰艇，深入到高原哨所、边防海岛，亲自向干部战士原原本本地宣讲毛主席的指示，组织学习讨论。广州部队某团还专门派出宣传组，爬山涉水，到远离领导的执勤小分队去进行宣传。连队普遍举办报告会、讲用会，出墙报，编节目，通过各种方式，大力宣传毛主席的这一指示。北京部队某部“爱民模范连”的同志们满怀激情地说：毛主席真是太英明、太伟大了！毛主席的这一指示，给我军建设提出了更高的要求，字字句句都说到了我们的心坎上。守卫在祖国南大门的“南海前哨钢八连”的干部战士，无限感激地说：我们伟大的领袖毛主席这样关怀军队建设，是我们最大的幸福！
    通过反复深入的学习，广大指战员打开了眼界，开阔了胸怀，深深认识到，毛主席的这一指示，是一个极为重要的具有历史意义的指示，是马克思列宁主义划时代的新发展，是天才的创造。它是反修防修，逐步消灭三个差别，引导我国向共产主义前进的根本措施，是加速我军非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的根本措施，是最切实、最有效地加强战备的根本措施。在南京部队召开的党委扩大会上，大家一致认为：按照毛主席的这一指示去办，就可以不负世界人民的期望，把我们这个七亿人口的大国，更好地建设成“世界革命的延安”。参加济南部队师以上干部学习座谈会的同志们，兴奋地谈到：毛主席这一伟大的号召是对帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派的判决书，是对反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的一切牛鬼蛇神的最沉重的打击。铁道兵某部很多同志说：毛主席站得高，看得远，想得深。毛主席看到的是共产主义在全世界胜利的大事，想到的是几代、几十代的百年大计，千年大计，万年大计。昆明部队某部领导机关的同志们回顾了我军的光荣传统，认识到把我军办成一个毛泽东思想的大学校，一支军队就可以当几支用：是保卫我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设、支援世界革命的主力军，是传播毛泽东思想、传播我党我军优良传统的宣传队，也是阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动的突击队。
    把我军办成一个毛泽东思想的大学校，就能更好地贯彻毛主席的建军路线，彻底清除资产阶级军事路线的影响。许多同志回忆了我军几十年来的斗争历史，深深体会到：把军队办成一个大学校，是毛主席一贯的建军思想。早在我军创建初期，毛主席就指出我军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团，规定了打仗、做群众工作、筹款为我军的三大任务。后来又根据形势的发展，明确规定我军永远是一个战斗队，同时又是一个工作队，一个生产队。三十九年来，我军坚决执行了毛主席的建军路线，建成了一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的新型的人民军队。现在，毛主席又发出了“人民解放军应该是一个大学校”的伟大号召，这是在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的新时期，总结了我军建军经验和世界革命斗争的经验，对无产阶级专政和建军理论的伟大发展。内蒙古军区某部同志们认为：有了这个总方向、总纲领，我军一定会以更快的步伐，沿着非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的道路前进。出席中共中央西南局学习毛主席著作积极分子会议代表、四川省雷波县武装部政委杨凤歧，在一次座谈会上说：“历史证明，只有把我军办成一个毛泽东思想的大学校，才能够更好地贯彻毛主席的建军思想，执行毛主席的建军路线。如果不这样做，就会滑到资产阶级军事路线上去，就会使我军脱离无产阶级政治，脱离工农群众，失去战斗力。”
    把我军办成一个毛泽东思想的大学校，就能更好地促进干部战士的思想革命化，造就千百万有高度政治觉悟的、全面发展的无产阶级革命事业接班人。成都部队某团团长张绍立表示：“我要在毛泽东思想的大学校里，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。身在高原，放眼世界，全心全意为中国人民和世界人民服务，坚决保持一个无产阶级革命者的晚节。”某部学习毛主席著作积极分子刘玉祥说：“我们这些年轻的后生，一定要在这个大学校里努力改造自己，才能接好毛泽东思想的班，接好无产阶级革命事业的班，坚决把无产阶级革命进行到底。”6410部队的一些知识青年经过学习讨论，深深感到能在这个大学校里学习、生活、战斗，是最大的幸福。他们向党表示决心：一定要炼红思想，炼红意志，炼就一双改天换地的钢手，磨出一副敢挑世界革命重担的铁肩。战斗在冰山雪岭的西藏军区广大干部战士发出誓言：我们要在伟大的毛泽东思想哺育下，造就出更多的建设社会主义新西藏、保卫祖国神圣边疆的英雄的战士和优秀的接班人。兰州部队某骑兵师、沈阳部队工程兵第四工区、总后勤部所属某部，以及驻守在帕米尔高原和喀喇昆仑山上的新疆军区的同志们，都纷纷来稿来信表示决心：一定要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，大搞思想革命化，打仗是战斗英雄，种田是劳动能手，做工是先进生产者，批判资产阶级，是打得最准、打得最狠的无产阶级革命家。一定要使枪杆子掌握在我们这个大学校培养出来的革命接班人手里，让党中央、毛主席和广大工人、贫下中农，一百个放心，一千个放心，一万个放心！
    把我军办成一个毛泽东思想的大学校，就能更好地贯彻毛主席的人民战争思想，从根本上加强战备。某守岛部队“军民联防模范连”，遵照毛主席的教导，处处和岛上人民打成一片，军民之间建立了鱼水相依、血肉相连的亲密关系。这个连的干部战士深切地体会到：毛主席这个指示就是英明！他们说，只要紧紧地依靠人民，搞好军民团结，整个海岛就能形成一个摧不垮、打不烂的坚强战斗堡垒。海军某部和福建前线某部三连的干部战士一致认为：贯彻了毛主席的这一指示，全国人民既是建设者，又是保卫者，“七亿人民七亿兵，万里江山万里营”，任何敌人妄想来侵犯，我们七亿人民拿起武器，人自为战，村自为战，定将敌人淹死在人民战争的汪洋大海之中。广大干部战士还用董存瑞、黄继光、雷锋、欧阳海、王杰、麦贤得、刘英俊等同志的英雄行为说明，最大的战斗力是毛泽东思想武装起来的人，把我军办成一个毛泽东思想的大学校，就能培养出千千万万个这样的共产主义战士，就能无往而不胜。
    毛主席的书，是我军这个大学校的最根本的必修课。阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三项伟大革命运动，是我军这个大学校的活课堂。全军贯彻毛主席的指示，正在掀起一个活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。各军种、兵种都根据自己的情况，调整了军政训练时间比例，增多了学习毛主席著作的时间。各部队把参加社会主义文化大革命当作当前重大的战斗任务，广大干部战士在这场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，更加自觉地活学活用毛主席著作，在斗争中学，在斗争中用。他们以毛泽东思想为武器，愤怒地控诉反党反社会主义黑帮的罪行，彻底批判一切牛鬼蛇神。许多单位展开了关于突出政治落实的讨论，进一步肃清资产阶级军事路线的影响。大家还结合当前国际形势，深入学习毛主席关于帝国主义本性的论述，进一步增强战备观念，密切注视着美帝国主义在越南和在我国周围的侵略行动，随时准备接受党和人民给予的任何战斗任务。

    据新华社二日讯　毛主席提出的各行各业都要办成亦工亦农、亦文亦武的革命化大学校的伟大号召，极大地振奋了天津、哈尔滨、韶山等地的工农兵群众、革命干部、革命知识分子和所有的共产党员。人们纷纷表示要从毛主席的这个英明指示中吸取无穷的力量、智慧和勇气，为实现党和毛主席提出的这个历史任务而奋斗。
    毛主席的这一指示传到天津后，极大地鼓舞了各条战线上广大革命职工的革命热情。他们说，照着毛主席的这一指示去做，就可以大大提高我国人民的无产阶级意识，促进人民的思想革命化，从而加速我国社会主义建设，更快地铲除资本主义、修正主义的社会基础和思想基础。他们热烈谈论着怎样首先在自己身上实现毛主席的这一指示。著名的革新闯将、天津制鞋厂工人司宝通说，按照毛主席的这一指示，做一个革命工人仅仅在生产上当一名技术革新闯将是非常不够的，应该首先是阶级斗争的闯将，革命的闯将。我们工人应该象解放军那样，能拿榔头做工，又能拿锄头种田，能拿枪杆子打敌人，又能拿笔杆子写文章批判旧世界，向阶级敌人作战。这样，我们就能够永远立于不败之地，什么样的困难都能克服，多么强大的敌人都能战胜。也只有这样，才能锻炼培养出一支突出毛泽东思想的革命化产业大军，才能保住社会主义江山。全国人民代表大会代表、河北省学习毛主席著作积极分子、天津市建筑构件一厂钢筋队卢珊说，经过前一段的无产阶级文化大革命，现在来学习毛主席这一最新指示，心里更加亮堂，体会得更亲切，感受更深刻了。这一指示就是防止产生修正主义和反对修正主义，防止资本主义复辟的最强大的思想武器。毛主席教导我们工人要以工为主，兼学军事、政治、文化，也要批判资产阶级。我们建筑工人就是遵循毛主席的指示这样做的。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们钢筋队三十五名工人，人人立志做旧世界的批判者，个个都拿起笔杆，写了四十多篇批判文章，对反党反社会主义黑帮的反革命言行，给了有力的回击。天津市食品一厂工人穆秀珍说，我们照毛主席的指示去做，就能使劳动人民知识化，知识分子劳动化，成为一代共产主义新人。
    哈尔滨各条战线的广大干部、职工热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召。黑龙江省和哈尔滨市劳动模范、哈尔滨电机厂一车间下线工王有说：毛主席为我们指出了建设共产主义的光明大道，照着毛主席的指示办工厂，就会使我们国家逐渐缩小三大差别，就会使我们很快地革命化。各行各业都按照毛主席的指示办事，我们的革命事业就会更加兴旺，就能对世界革命作出更大贡献。滨江区新发公社党委书记马宗岳学习了毛主席的指示后说，自从人民公社成立以来，新发公社按照毛主席的指示，以农为主，林、牧、副、渔全面发展，已经获得了很大的成绩。目前，农业收入占总收入的一半，另一半是林、牧、副、渔和自办工厂的收入。但是，离毛主席关于人民公社也要兼学军事、政治、文化和批判资产阶级的要求还差得很远。我们一定要向解放军学习，把军事、政治、文化学好，使每一个社员都成为能文能武的新型农民。他说，毛主席这一英明伟大的指示，是逐步缩小三大差别，逐步向共产主义过渡，使我国永不变色的保证。我们决心按照毛主席的指示，把人民公社办成象解放军那样革命化的大学校。
    毛主席的家乡——湖南省湘潭县韶山公社的干部和社员，决心按照毛主席的这个伟大思想来建设韶山。韶山公社党委在得知毛主席的这个指示后，立即召开扩大会议认真进行学习和讨论。公社党委根据毛主席关于“公社农民以农为主（包括林、牧、副、渔），也要兼学军事、政治、文化。在有条件的时候，也要由集体办些小工厂，也要批判资产阶级”的教导，对全社的农业、工业、林业、牧业和军事、政治、文化的学习等方面，重新做了初步安排。其中，特别强调一定要把活学活用毛主席著作摆在一切工作的首位。这是把韶山变成亦工亦农、亦文亦武的革命化大学校根本的根本。韶山学校根据毛主席“学制要缩短，教育要革命”的伟大号召，决定改变现有学制，实行半农半读，他们决心将韶山学校办成一个高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的革命化学校。现在，韶山公社各个大队都召开了党员、团员、贫农下中农骨干和参加过公社党校学习的积极分子会议，认真学习和讨论毛主席的这个指示。公社以这一部分人为核心，在全社范围内组织了近千名宣传大军，深入田间向广大社员群众进行宣传，并且边贯彻，边行动。（附图片）
