Chairman Mao teaches me:
For the revolution, hold tight to the gun, farm well
Vice Commander of the Brigade Militia Camp, Tian Qi

I started working in the production team at the age of fifteen. At that time, I only knew how to earn work points and eat, and I found life meaningless.

That winter, my elder brother asked me to join the core militia. In the past, I would cover my ears whenever I heard gunshots. Joining the militia meant standing guard at night, which was troublesome and scary, so I didn't want to go. My father said, "You've forgotten your roots! Our family has been poor for generations. If it weren't for Chairman Mao and the Communist Party coming to liberate us, you would have been sold too. In the past, we suffered so much because the poor had no guns! Today, the poor are in power, and if the poor don't hold guns, who will?" My father also said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people.' If you don't study Chairman Mao's works, you won't understand the principles!" I felt very sad after hearing his words. The reactionaries are so vicious; I must listen to Chairman Mao's words and join the militia. I must also study Chairman Mao's works diligently.

Studying Chairman Mao's works helped me understand many principles. Originally, I thought I was just a girl and had no use. Chairman Mao's books pointed out the direction for me, making me understand that both men and women have the responsibility to be militia members, to resist imperialism, and to prevent the sabotage of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements. I then boldly joined the militia training. However, during the first live-fire shooting, I was still nervous, and the bullet flew into the sky when I pulled the trigger. Everyone laughed at me, and I thought, "How embarrassing!" Should I quit practicing? But then I thought, if I give up at the first sign of difficulty, how can I resist imperialism? No! I must continue practicing! My strength was not enough, and I couldn't aim accurately, so I practiced every day by lifting stones weighing over ten pounds. My wrists became sore and swollen, but I thought of Chairman Mao's words: "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." I was no longer afraid of hardship or pain. In several shooting performances, I was rated as an excellent shooter.

After studying Chairman Mao's quotations, I knew that Chairman Mao had great hopes for the youth and taught us to build socialism with self-reliance. I worked even harder. Last summer, during the harvest and planting season, I developed poisonous sores on my back, which were very painful. I really wanted to rest for a few days, but then I thought, if the team has many fields and few people, and the transplanting is slow, it will miss the season and affect the harvest. I read Chairman Mao's quotations: "Promote the spirit of daring to fight, fearing no sacrifice, fearing no fatigue, and continuous fighting (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)." I finally persevered. Last summer, the team's pigs lacked feed, and the team leader sent a few young men to the deep mountains to cut wild bananas. The round trip required walking several dozen miles, and it was raining heavily. I thought of Chairman Mao's words: "The more difficult the place, the more we should go, that's what a good comrade does." I asked the team leader to send me too. I climbed mountains and crossed rivers with everyone to cut the wild bananas, and I carried ninety pounds.

### 毛主席教导我：为革命握紧枪，种好田

    毛主席教导我：
    为革命握紧枪，种好田
    大队民兵营副营长　田齐
    我十五岁就在生产队参加劳动。那时节，我每天只知道挣工分、吃饭，日子过得没有意思。
    这一年冬天，大哥叫我参加基干民兵。我过去听见枪声都要捂住耳朵，当民兵，要在黑夜里放哨，又麻烦、又怕人，我不肯去。阿爸说：“你忘本了！我家祖祖辈辈都是受苦人。要不是毛主席、共产党来解放我们，连你也要卖掉。过去这样苦，都是因为穷人没有枪杆子！今天穷人坐了天下，穷人不拿枪，叫谁拿？”阿爸又说：“毛主席教导我们：‘没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切’。你不学毛主席著作，就不明白道理！”我听了他的话，心里很难过。反动派这么狠毒，我一定要听毛主席的话，参加民兵；还要好好学习毛主席著作。
    学习了毛主席著作，使我明白了许多道理。原来我认为自己是个女孩子，没有什么用。毛主席的书给我指出了方向，使我明白了，当民兵，对付帝国主义，严防地富反坏的破坏，男子、女子都有责任，我就大胆去参加练武了。不过，第一次实弹射击，还是心头发慌，一扣扳机，子弹上了天。人家笑我，我想，真羞死人了，不练了吧！又一想，毛主席对民兵这样重视，我遇到困难就泄气，怎么对付帝国主义？不行！还是练！我的手力不够，瞄不准，就天天托十几斤重的石头，练得手腕又酸又疼，还肿起来了。我想起毛主席说的：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”就不怕苦，不怕疼了。在几次射击表演中，我都评上了优秀射手。
    学了毛主席语录，知道毛主席对青年的希望很大，又教导我们用自力更生精神建设社会主义。我劳动的劲头更大了。前年夏收夏种的时候，我背上长了毒疮，痛得很厉害，真想歇几天；再一想，队里田多人少，插秧慢，就误了季节，影响收成。我读着毛主席的语录：“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。”终于坚持下来了。去年夏天，队里养的猪缺饲料，队长派几个男青年去深山斩野蕉。来回要走几十里路，又下着大雨。我想到毛主席的话：“越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”就要求队长也派我去。我和大家一起爬山过水把野蕉斩回来，我担了九十斤。
    我今年才十八岁，刚刚按照毛主席指引的道路开步走。革命的路还很长。我下决心一生一世读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，为革命握紧枪杆，为革命种好田。
