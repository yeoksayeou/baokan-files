The hosts frequently raised their glasses to toast the glorious victories achieved by the just struggles of the representatives from various countries, expressing their admiration for their fighting spirit. Guests and hosts exchanged warm greetings and encouraged each other to carry on the struggle against American imperialism and modern revisionism to the end.

Guo Moruo spoke at the reception, warmly welcoming friends from various countries who uphold the glorious tradition of the movement to ban nuclear and hydrogen bombs. He said, "American imperialism is a paper tiger, Soviet revisionism is a paper tiger, all reactionaries in various countries are paper tigers, and the reactionary Sato government of Japan and a few small merchants who betray principles are also paper tigers. These big and small paper tigers will all be burned by the people of the world. He expressed his firm belief that the Vietnamese people will win, American imperialism will be defeated; the people of the world will win, and splitism will be defeated. The international united front against American imperialism will certainly continue to expand and consolidate, and will certainly achieve victory."
