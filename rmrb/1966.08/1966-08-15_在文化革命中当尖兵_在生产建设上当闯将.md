In the Cultural Revolution, we are pioneers;
In production and construction, we are vanguards.

On the afternoon of the 13th, we heard the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on the radio, and our hearts were extremely excited and elated! As we listened, we thought: This is another great call from our great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee! This is another great joy for the people of the entire country!

On the evening of August 10, our most beloved leader Chairman Mao received the revolutionary masses who came to report their joy. Our factory's contingent stood at the forefront. Chairman Mao, with a beaming smile, came to our side and shook hands with most of the comrades from our factory who came to report their joy. In the past few days, the hearts of all the workers in our factory have been boiling like molten iron in a smelting furnace. Everyone feels full of energy, and every heart is restless. Day and night, we always feel that Chairman Mao is standing among us workers. Now, we have heard the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. This session was convened under the personal direction of Chairman Mao. This communiqué was personally directed by Chairman Mao. How could this not make us even happier and more jubilant! The communiqué is a document of great historical significance, and every word and sentence resonates with our hearts, giving us the greatest inspiration and strength once again! We enthusiastically support the "communiqué" and resolutely implement the battle calls of the "communiqué"!

We have personally experienced and seen: Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, our country is becoming more prosperous every day, and everything is going well. The people of our country are doing things every day in the three great revolutionary movements that previous generations did not dare to do, and even did not dare to think about. In recent years, our factory has learned from Daqing and the People's Liberation Army, and more and more people have consciously studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, gradually establishing the consciousness of being the masters of the state; since the Cultural Revolution began, class consciousness has been further heightened. Our working-class revolutionary ranks have become even purer and stronger. The facts have proven that once the workers grasp Mao Zedong Thought, there is nothing they cannot do.

The communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party is a call to arms for the people of the entire country, and first of all, for us, the working class, to strive for greater victories. We resolutely respond to the call of our great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and take the "communiqué" as our action guideline. In the future, we will work even harder to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the "application"; we are determined to be pioneers in the Cultural Revolution and vanguards in production and construction; with practical actions, we will support the Vietnamese comrades in their struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. In short, whatever Chairman Mao says, whatever the Party Central Committee says, we will resolutely carry it out. We dare to climb the knife mountain and descend into the fire sea. We will definitely always put politics in command, carry the Cultural Revolution to a thorough victory; strive for victory in completing the Third Five-Year Plan, and will not rest until the goal is achieved!

    在生产建设上当闯将

    十三日下午五点钟，我们从广播中听到了党的八届十一中全会公报，心情非常激动，非常兴奋！我们一边听，一边想：这是伟大领袖毛主席和党中央的又一个伟大号召！这是全国人民的又一件大喜事！
    八月十日晚上，我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席会见了报喜的革命群众。我们厂的队伍站在最前面，毛主席满面笑容地来到我们身边，和我们厂来报喜的绝大部分同志握了手。几天来，我们全厂职工的心就像炼铁炉里的铁水一样上下沸腾，每个人都觉得浑身有使不完的劲，一颗颗心就是平静不下来，白天、晚上，总觉得毛主席就站在我们工人当中。现在，我们又听到了党的八届十一中全会公报。这次会议，是在毛主席亲自主持下召开的。这个公报，是毛主席亲自主持制定的，这怎么能不使我们高兴更加高兴，欢腾更加欢腾！公报是一个有伟大历史意义的文献，字字句句都说到我们心坎上，又一次给了我们以最大的鼓舞，最大的力量！我们最热烈地拥护“公报”，最坚决地去实现“公报”的战斗号召！
    我们亲身经历、亲眼看到：在毛主席的英明领导下，我们的国家一天比一天兴旺，一派大好形势。我国人民在三项伟大革命运动中天天都在做着前人不敢做、甚至连想也不敢想的事。近几年来，我们厂学大庆，学解放军，越来越多的人自觉地活学活用毛主席著作，逐步树立起国家主人翁的思想；文化大革命开展以来，又进一步提高了阶级觉悟。我们工人阶级的革命队伍更加纯洁和强大了。事实证明，我们工人一经掌握了毛泽东思想，就没有办不到的事情。
    党的八届十一中全会公报，就是对全国人民、首先是对我们工人阶级发出的一个争取更大胜利的进军号。我们坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席和党中央的号召，把“公报”作为自己的行动纲领。我们今后要更加努力活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫；决心在文化革命中当尖兵，在生产建设上当闯将；以实际行动支援越南兄弟的抗美救国斗争。总之，只要是毛主席说的，党中央说的，我们就坚决去办。刀山敢上，火海敢下。我们一定要永远突出政治，把文化大革命进行到彻底胜利；为争取胜利完成第三个五年计划而努力，不达目的，誓不罢休！
