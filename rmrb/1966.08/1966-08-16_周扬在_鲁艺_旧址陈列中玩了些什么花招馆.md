In recent years, the number of visits by people of all ethnic groups in China and foreign friends to Yan'an has been increasing year by year. They regard Yan'an as a treasure house of Mao Zedong Thought, learning revolutionary traditions from here and learning revolutionary experiences from China. In 1963, the CPC Shaanxi Provincial Committee and Yan'an District Committee, in light of this situation, proposed to open up a few more revolutionary sites in Yan'an and vigorously promote Mao Zedong Thought.

In the preparation work for this, Zhou Yang personally took charge of the preparation of the Lu Xun Academy of Arts exhibition hall. He sent people to take charge of the preparation; he revised the exhibition plan and personally adjusted the exhibition content. In this series of activities, what anti-party activities did Zhou Yang engage in?

1. Attacking the great Mao Zedong Thought, attempting to belittle Chairman Mao's significance of the "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art."

The CPC Shaanxi Provincial Committee and Yan'an District Committee clearly stated at the beginning of the preparation work that the entire exhibition must be based on Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and highlight the red line of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought. However, Zhou Yang and others did not listen at all. The initial draft of the exhibition plan was divided into periods, and Zhou Yang saw that this was not to his advantage, so he maliciously said, "It is not necessary to divide by period, that way it is not good for explaining the problem," "it should be divided by issue." Under his instructions, the plan was revised twice, determining that the first three units were all about the period before the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art; the part about the "Talks" and activities after the "Talks" was only in the fourth unit. Zhou Yang attempted to use such an exhibition to obliterate the great significance of Chairman Mao's "Talks" and highlight the correctness of the bourgeois, revisionist literary and artistic black line represented by him.

After the revised plan was drawn up, when opinions were sought in Beijing, Xi'an, and Yan'an, many comrades pointed out with one word that this exhibition did not highlight the red line of Mao Zedong Thought. However, the Zhou Yang gang stubbornly refused to adopt these opinions. They used only a small amount of exhibits to represent Chairman Mao's "On New Democracy," "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and the rectification of literature and art, as well as the participation of literary and artistic workers in the masses, while stuffing a large number of literary and artistic works from before the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art into the exhibition section after the forum.

2. Exaggerating the "achievements" of the Lu Xun Academy of Arts, denying the Party's leadership, and highlighting himself.

In the general explanation of the exhibition they carefully prepared, they arrogantly wrote: "The Lu Xun Academy of Arts also laid a certain foundation for the socialist cultural and artistic construction of New China." This is a blatant denial of the Party's leadership of literary and artistic work, attempting to belittle the great foundational role of Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "On New Democracy" and "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" in socialist literature and art.

On May 29, 1965, when Zhou Yang visited the preview exhibition, he personally cut out exhibits that could highlight the Party's leadership of literary and artistic work. He saw the names of our great leader Mao Zedong and Comrade Zhou Enlai and others listed as initiators on the "Origin of the Establishment" screen, and said, "Do not write the initiators on the origin." When he saw that the "Educational Policy of the Lu Xun Academy of Arts" was signed "Drafted after discussion by the CPC Central Committee's Propaganda Department and formally approved by the Central Secretariat," he said it should be removed. There was a large photo of Chairman Mao giving a lecture at the Lu Xun Academy of Arts in the exhibition, and Zhou Yang also tried to remove it on the pretext.

At the same time, Zhou Yang tried every means to highlight himself in the exhibition. He sent a photo of himself teaching at the Lu Xun Academy of Arts, and even sent a photo of his child when he was at the Lu Xun Academy of Arts. When he saw a newspaper photo of the publication of his "The Problem of Reforming Art Education," he said, "It can be enlarged." In the entire exhibition, there were fourteen exhibits related to Zhou Yang, and photos of Zhou Yang and photos of articles he wrote were all enlarged and placed in prominent positions. Last May, Zhou Yang also wanted to exhibit his article "On Zhao Shuli's Creation" written in August 1946, attempting to promote a large amount of revisionist black goods he advocated in this article.

3. Distorting the history of the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region's literary and artistic movement, denying that workers, peasants, and soldiers are the masters of culture.

From the beginning of the preparation work, Zhou Yang set the tone for the exhibition, saying that the reflection of the literary and artistic activities of the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region should be "a little less." Therefore, in the initial few plans, there was very little representation of mass literary and artistic activities.

After Zhou Yang saw the preview exhibition, he first targeted the "East Is Red," which praises the boundless love of billions of people for the great leader, saying that "East Is Red" is "placed in an inappropriate position" and wanted to put "East Is Red" in the music creation section of the Lu Xun Academy of Arts. Later, Zhou Yang said that the mass arts section was "too thin" and wanted to combine the mass yangge with the Lu Xun Academy of Arts yangge, put folk songs in the music section of the Lu Xun Academy of Arts, and put paper-cutting in the art section of the Lu Xun Academy of Arts. He said that this could "show the Lu Xun Academy of Arts learning from the masses and promoting the masses, and reflect the relationship between popularization and improvement." Zhou Yang thus blatantly distorted the history of the border region's literary and artistic movement, shamelessly claiming that the mass literary and artistic movement, which flourished after the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," was developed under the "promotion" of these bourgeois "authorities," denying that workers, peasants, and soldiers are the masters of socialist literature and art.

The people of Yan'an have boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and boundless admiration for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The Zhou Yang gang stretched their black hands into the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an to engage in counter-revolutionary activities. They are blind!

### 周扬在“鲁艺”旧址陈列中玩了些什么花招馆

　　周扬在“鲁艺”旧址陈列中玩了些什么花招
　　延安革命纪念馆
    近几年来，到延安来访问的我国各族人民和外国朋友，年年都在成倍增加。他们把延安作为学习毛泽东思想的宝库，从这里学习延安的革命传统，学习我国的革命经验。一九六三年，中共陕西省委及延安地委根据这种情况，建议在延安再开辟几处革命旧址陈列，大力宣传毛泽东思想。
    在这项筹备工作中，周扬一手把持了鲁艺旧址陈列室的筹备工作。由他派人主持筹备；由他修改陈列方案，亲自调整陈列内容。在这一系列活动里，周扬干了些什么反党勾当呢？
    一、攻击伟大的毛泽东思想，妄图贬低毛主席
  《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的伟大意义。
    中共陕西省委和延安地委在筹备工作中，一开始就明确提出，整个陈列必须以毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》为纲，突出毛泽东文艺思想的红线。但是周扬等人根本不听。最初拟定的陈列方案，是按时期分单元的，周扬看到这样分对他不利，就别有用心地说：“不一定按阶段分，那样不好说明问题”，“要按问题分”。在他的授意下，方案经过两次修改，确定前三个单元都是表现延安文艺座谈会以前的；表现《讲话》及《讲话》以后活动的，只有第四单元这一部分。周扬企图通过这样的陈列，抹煞毛主席《讲话》的伟大意义，突出以他为代表的资产阶级、修正主义文艺黑线是“一贯正确”的。
    修改方案订出以后，在北京、西安、延安等地征求意见时，许多同志一针见血地指出：这个陈列没有突出毛泽东思想的红线。但是周扬黑帮顽固地拒绝采纳这些意见，他们只用少量的陈列品，表现毛主席的《新民主主义论》、《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》以及文艺整风，文艺工作者深入群众等内容，而把延安文艺座谈会以前的大量文艺作品，塞进了座谈会以后的陈列部分。
    二、夸大鲁艺“成绩”，抹煞党的领导，突出自己。
    在他们精心制作的陈列总说明中，狂妄地写道：鲁艺“对新中国的社会主义文化艺术建设，也奠定了一定的基础。”这是明目张胆地否认党对文艺工作的领导，妄图贬低毛主席的《新民主主义论》、《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》等光辉著作对社会主义文学艺术所起的伟大奠基作用。
    一九六五年五月二十九日，周扬在看预展时，又亲自动手，大砍能突出体现党对文艺工作领导的陈列品。他看到鲁艺“创立缘起”（节录）屏上所列的发起人中，有我们伟大领袖毛主席和周恩来同志等的名字，就说：“缘起上的发起人不要写。”看到“鲁艺教育方针”的落款写着“经中共中央宣传部讨论拟定、经中央书记处正式通过”时，又说要去掉落款。陈列中有一张毛主席给鲁艺上课的大照片，周扬也企图借口抽掉。
    与此同时，周扬却千方百计地在陈列中突出表现他自己。他送来他在鲁艺上课的照片，甚至连他孩子在鲁艺时的照片也送来了。他看到发表他的《艺术教育的改造问题》的报纸照片时，说：“还可以放大些。”整个陈列中，有关周扬的陈列品共十四件之多，有周扬出现的照片和他写的文章的照片，都放得大大的，陈列在显著部位。去年五月，周扬又要把他在一九四六年八月写的《论赵树理的创作》一文陈列出来，妄图推销他在这篇文章里所鼓吹的一大堆修正主义黑货。
    三、篡改陕甘宁边区文艺运动的历史，否认工农兵是文化的主人。
    筹备工作一开始，周扬就为陈列定下了调子，说什么反映陕甘宁边区文艺活动要“少一点”。因此在最初几个方案中，都极少表现群众文艺活动。
    周扬看了预展以后，先向歌颂亿万人民对伟大领袖无限热爱的《东方红》下毒手，说《东方红》“位置放得不合适”，要把《东方红》放在鲁艺的音乐创作部分。以后，周扬又说群众文艺部分“太单薄”，要把群众秧歌合并在鲁艺秧歌里，民歌放在鲁艺音乐部分，剪纸放在鲁艺美术部分。他胡说什么这样可以“表现鲁艺向群众学习，又推动了群众，可以体现普及和提高的关系。”周扬就是这样明目张胆地篡改边区文艺运动的历史，把毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表以后蓬勃发展起来的群众文艺运动，恬不知耻地说成是由他们这些资产阶级“权威”们“推动”下发展起来的，否认工农兵是社会主义文化艺术的主人。
    延安人民无限热爱伟大的领袖毛主席，无限崇拜战无不胜的毛泽东思想。周扬黑帮把黑手伸向革命圣地延安，进行反革命活动，他们是瞎了狗眼！
