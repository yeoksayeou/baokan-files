	Money Can't Solve Everything; Political Leadership Can
	Song Léshān, an Active Learner of Chairman Mao's Works in the Wuhan Military Region

	People like Sun Yefang have been attacking the principle of political leadership, advocating profit-driven approaches, and claiming that "profit" should drive the entire national economy. This is nothing but trash from the store of Khrushchev's revisionism. Following this path would lead to a few people getting rich while the majority suffer poverty. This is the same old road that the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries took in pre-liberation China. It was a society where people preyed on each other, driving my entire family to endure immense hardship. My father worked as a long-term laborer for landlords all his life. At the age of ten, I herded pigs for the landlords, but in the end, not only did I not get paid, but I was kicked out. In the old society, every laboring family had class struggles, and everyone had blood and tears. The ruthless exploitation by landlords and capitalists, and the "profit-driven" approach, brought us immense suffering. We will never forget it, and our descendants will never forget it either.

	Today, our socialist construction is making rapid progress, creating countless miracles. What is the secret behind this? It's not about foreign aid, coercion, profits, material incentives, or bourgeois "experts" and "authorities." The key is Mao Zedong Thought and the revolutionization of people's thinking. Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by workers, peasants, and soldiers, it can be transformed into immense material force. As Chairman Mao taught: "The correct ideology of the advanced class, once grasped by the masses, will become a material force to transform society and the world." Our country has seen many advanced industrial enterprises like Daqing and advanced agricultural units like Dazhai, all thanks to Mao Zedong Thought taking the lead.

	The entire socialist revolution and construction are like this, and so is my personal work. I am involved in the logistics work of the military. Over the years, I have repeatedly completed procurement tasks assigned by the organization quickly, efficiently, and economically, all thanks to Mao Zedong Thought. I deeply feel that economic work, like other work, can be done well when political leadership is emphasized, focusing on the revolutionization of people's thinking and arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought. Conversely, without political leadership, focusing only on business, no work can be done well. When I first started procurement work, I thought it was just about exchanging money for goods, with contracts for transactions and standards for quality, and that I just needed to push things forward. However, I encountered many difficulties. Later, I paid special attention to implementing political leadership in my work. In June 1964, I went to Luobei County in Heilongjiang to transport planks and stools. The timber yard's processing speed was slow, and some products did not meet the quality standards. I studied "Pay Attention to the People's Livelihood and Work Methods." Chairman Mao said: "To mobilize the masses to devote their full strength to the front, one must be among the masses, mobilize the masses' enthusiasm, care about the masses' pain, and genuinely work for the masses' interests." I labored and studied with the workers, learning Chairman Mao's "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and teachings on thrift and self-reliance. I inspired everyone to take an owner's attitude towards production and make greater contributions to the revolution. The workers listened to Chairman Mao's words, the more they studied, the more they wanted to study, and the more enthusiastic they became. They said: "Whatever Chairman Mao says, we do it, and we do it 'completely' and 'thoroughly'." As a result, the entire processing and transportation task proceeded smoothly. Things that money can't solve can be solved with political leadership. This made me realize: No matter how difficult things are, with Mao Zedong Thought, nothing is difficult; no matter how many principles there are, the first one is to insist on Mao Zedong Thought taking the lead; no matter how much things change, emphasizing proletarian politics cannot change. Emphasizing proletarian politics and completely and thoroughly following Chairman Mao's instructions makes everything easy; without proletarian politics and Mao Zedong Thought, one is at a loss and achieves nothing.

	Political leadership is proposed by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao based on the laws of socialist society's development and the economic foundation of socialist society. It is proposed based on the fact that class struggle still exists in socialist society. It is a fundamental measure to eliminate bourgeois ideology, promote proletarian ideology, oppose and prevent revisionism, and ensure that our country will never change color. Sun Yefang, you slander political leadership and advocate profit-driven approaches, aiming to restore capitalism. This will never happen; we will fight you to the end.

    靠钱办不好的事  政治挂帅就办好了
    武汉部队学习毛主席著作积极分子　宋乐山
    孙冶方之流大肆攻击政治挂帅，竭力鼓吹利润挂帅，说什么要用“利润”带动“整个国民经济”。这完全是从赫鲁晓夫修正主义黑店批发来的破烂。走上了这条路，就会使得少数人发财致富，多数人贫困破产。这也就是解放前蒋介石反动派在中国走过的老路。就是那种人吃人的社会，逼得我全家吃尽了苦中苦。我父亲给地主当了一辈子长工。我十岁就给地主放猪，到头来不仅拿不到工钱，反而被一脚踢了出来。在旧社会，劳动人民家家都有阶级苦，人人都有血泪仇。地主、资本家的残酷剥削和“利润挂帅”给我们带来的苦难，我们忘不了，我们的子孙后代也永远忘不了。
    今天，我们社会主义建设突飞猛进，创造出无数人间奇迹。这靠的是什么呢？一不靠外援，二不靠强制，三不靠利润、物质刺激，四不靠资产阶级“专家”、“权威”。唯一的是靠毛泽东思想，靠人的思想革命化。毛泽东思想一旦被工农兵掌握，就能转化为巨大的物质力量。正如毛主席所教导的：“代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。”我们国家出现了许多大庆式的工业先进企业，大寨式的农业先进单位，都是毛泽东思想挂帅的结果。
    整个社会主义革命和建设事业是这样，我个人的工作也是这样。我是做部队后勤工作的。几年来，我一次又一次多快好省地完成了组织上交给的采购任务，靠的就是毛泽东思想。我深刻地体会到：经济工作与其他的工作一样，每当实行了政治挂帅，着眼于人的思想革命化，用毛泽东思想武装群众，各项工作都能搞好；相反，不实行政治挂帅，只抓业务，什么工作都搞不好。我开始搞采购工作的时候，以为一手交钱，一手交货，办事有合同，质量有标准，抓紧就行了，结果吃了不少苦头。以后，我就特别注意在工作中坚持毛泽东思想挂帅。一九六四年六月，我到黑龙江萝北县去运铺板、铺凳。贮木场加工速度缓慢，并有一些产品质量不合要求。我学习了《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》。毛主席说：“要群众拿出他们的全力放到战线上去么？那末，就得和群众在一起，就得去发动群众的积极性，就得关心群众的痛痒，就得真心实意地为群众谋利益”。我便同工人一起劳动，一起学习毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》和有关勤俭建国、自力更生的教导，启发大家以主人翁的态度搞好生产，为革命做出更大的贡献。工人最听毛主席的话，越学越想学，越学干劲越大。他们说：“毛主席咋说，咱咋干，干就干个‘完全’、‘彻底’。”结果，整个加工运输任务进行得很顺利。靠钱办不好的事，政治挂帅就办好了。这使我体会到：千难万难，有了毛泽东思想就不难；千条万条，坚持毛泽东思想挂帅第一条；千变万变，突出无产阶级政治不能变。突出了无产阶级政治，完全彻底地照毛主席的指示办事，就事事好办；离开了无产阶级政治，离开了毛泽东思想，就走投无路，一事无成。
    政治挂帅，是党中央和毛主席根据社会主义社会的发展规律和社会主义社会的经济基础提出来的，是根据社会主义社会还存在着阶级和阶级斗争的事实提出来的。它是灭资产阶级思想，兴无产阶级思想，反对和防止修正主义，保证我们国家永不变色的根本措施。孙冶方，你污蔑政治挂帅，宣扬利润挂帅，就是要实现资本主义复辟。这绝对办不到，我们一定要同你斗到底。
