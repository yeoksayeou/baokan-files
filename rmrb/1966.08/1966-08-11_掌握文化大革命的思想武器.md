The decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has enabled the people of our country to hear the voice of our great leader, Comrade Mao Zedong.

This decision summarizes the new experiences created by the broad masses of our country in the proletarian cultural revolution movement and reflects their revolutionary pioneering spirit.

Comrade Mao Zedong said: Our policy must not only be known to the leaders and cadres but also to the broad masses of the people. When the masses know the truth and have a common goal, they will unite to do things. When the masses unite, everything becomes easy.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, all Communist Party members, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary intellectuals, revolutionary teachers, and students should seriously study this decision of the Party Central Committee. They should familiarize themselves with it, master it, and apply it. They should compare the policies and guidelines stipulated in the decision with the situation of the cultural revolution in their own units over the past period, continue what is correct, resolutely correct what is wrong, and do what has not been done.

There are two diametrically opposed policies, two diametrically opposed lines, and two diametrically opposed practices. One is to trust the masses, rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and believe that the masses can liberate and educate themselves in the movement. The other is to stand against the masses in key moments of the revolution and suppress the masses. The former is the revolutionary line of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The latter is the erroneous line against Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

Against the erroneous line, we must resolutely resist, criticize, and struggle. Only in this way can the correct line be implemented, and the Cultural Revolution can be led to victory.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is an unprecedented great revolution. Such a revolution inevitably encounters various obstacles. As the decision points out, "the resistance is still considerable and stubborn at present." To implement the decision of the Party Central Committee, we must struggle against the erroneous lines within the Party, against various opportunisms, and against the old social forces of habit.

Marx and Engels said in the "Communist Manifesto": "The communist revolution is the most radical rupture with traditional property relations; no wonder that its development moves in the most radical rupture with traditional ideas."

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway is to eliminate the ideological and cultural remnants of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. It is to eradicate the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits that prepare for the restoration of capitalism. It is to enable the broad masses to grasp Mao Zedong Thought and create new socialist ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits.

With the powerful ideological weapon of the Party Central Committee's decision in hand, the 700 million people of our country will certainly be able to unite more closely, break through all obstacles, and unleash the force to move mountains and seas. They will overthrow the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and sweep away all monsters and demons.

　　掌握文化大革命的思想武器
    中共中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定，使我国人民群众听到了我们伟大的领袖毛泽东同志的声音。
    这个决定，总结了我国广大群众在无产阶级文化革命运动中创造的新经验，反映了他们革命的首创精神。
    毛泽东同志说：我们的政策，不光要使领导者知道，干部知道，还要使广大群众知道。群众知道了真理，有了共同的目的，就会齐心来做。群众齐心了，一切事情就好办了。
    广大工农兵群众，所有的共产党员，革命的工作人员，革命的知识分子，革命的师生，都应当认真地学习党中央这个决定。要熟习它，精通它，应用它。要把决定中规定的方针、政策，同本单位前一个时期文化革命的情况，进行对照、比较，对的就继续照办，错的就坚决改正，还没有做的就要去做。
    有两种相反的方针，两种相反的政策，两种相反的做法。一种是，信任群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，相信群众在运动中能够自己解放自己，自己教育自己，热情地支持群众的革命精神和革命行动。另一种是，在革命的关键时刻，站在群众的对立面，压制群众。前一种就是执行马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的革命路线。后一种就是执行反马克思列宁主义、反毛泽东思想的错误路线。
    对于错误的路线，必须坚决地抵制、批判、斗争。这样才能使正确的路线得以贯彻执行，才能使文化大革命走向胜利。
    无产阶级文化革命，是一场史无前例的大革命。这样的革命，不可能不遇到种种的阻力。正如决定所指出的，“这种阻力目前还是相当大的，顽强的。”要贯彻执行党中央的决定，就一定要同党内的错误路线作斗争，同各种各样的机会主义作斗争，同旧的社会习惯势力作斗争。
    马克思和恩格斯在《共产党宣言》中说：“共产主义革命就是同传统的所有制关系实行最彻底的决裂；毫不奇怪，它在自己的发展进程中要同传统的观念实行最彻底的决裂。”
    当前正在进行的这场无产阶级文化大革命，就是为了消除资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的意识形态，就是要消灭那些为资本主义复辟作准备的旧思想，旧文化，旧风俗，旧习惯，就是要让毛泽东思想为最广泛的群众所掌握，创造社会主义的新思想，新文化，新风俗，新习惯。
    我国七亿人民掌握了党中央决定这个强大的思想武器，就一定能进一步地团结起来，冲破重重障碍，发挥翻山倒海的力量，打倒党内走资本主义道路的当权派，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。
