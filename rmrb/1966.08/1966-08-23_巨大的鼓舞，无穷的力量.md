Our great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, together with a million revolutionary masses in the capital, celebrated the joyous news of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. When this news reached our Dongling Village in Hainan Island, I was so moved that tears welled up in my eyes. It was as if our great leader Chairman Mao, amidst the cheers of the masses, had come to my side with vigorous steps, smiling and shaking my hand. A thousand words cannot express my love for Chairman Mao.

On the afternoon of October 10, 1965, at around 2 PM, I had an unforgettable moment when I saw Chairman Mao, whom I had longed for day and night. I happily shook Chairman Mao's hand and happily stood by his side shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!" In recent days, one piece of good news after another has come from Beijing, making me extremely excited. I, a poor peasant who was once trampled underfoot by the rich in the old society, never dreamed that my hands, calloused from hard work, could happily shake Chairman Mao's hand. Chairman Mao cares for us the most, trusts us the most, and supports us the most. Who in the world is happier than us? Now I have only one wish: to definitely follow Chairman Mao's words. Comrade Lin Biao said, "When the people grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they become the smartest and bravest, and can unleash boundless strength!" These words are truly right. To make a revolution, there are countless principles, but grasping Mao Zedong Thought is the first principle. In battle and production, there are countless principles, but grasping Mao Zedong Thought is also the first principle. Whatever we do, if we follow Chairman Mao's instructions, we will not fear any difficulty.

Take my capture of the American spy plane pilot, for example! On September 20 last year, when the American air pirates invaded our airspace over Hainan Island, they were very aggressive. But our naval air force, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, struck them down as soon as they took to the skies. I held a stick, and the American pilot, Smith, surrendered to me. Chairman Mao said, imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. They seem frightening, but in reality, they have no significant power. These words are all true. Now, our militia squad, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has an even greater enthusiasm for studying Chairman Mao's works, and we are braver, wiser, and stronger. Everyone says: not to mention one or two Smiths, even if ten million, a hundred million, or thousands of millions of Smiths came, they would only be our prisoners!

Most beloved Chairman Mao! I will definitely listen to your words, carry forward the bold, daring, revolutionary, and rebellious spirit of the proletarian revolution, and with the hand you have shaken, firmly grasp the rifle to defend the proletarian's mountains and rivers, sweep away all ghosts and monsters, and resolutely eliminate all enemies who dare to invade.

    巨大的鼓舞，无穷的力量
    我们的伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席在首都和百万革命群众共庆无产阶级文化大革命的喜讯，传到我们海南岛东岭村时，我激动得热泪盈眶，好像伟大领袖毛主席在万众欢呼声中，又迈着矫健步伐来到我身边，微笑地握着我的手。千言万言难表达我对毛主席的热爱。
    一九六五年十月十日下午二时许，是我终生难忘的时刻，我见到了日日夜夜想念的毛主席。我最幸福地握着毛主席的手，最幸福地站在毛主席的身边高喊着“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”这几天来，从北京不断传来一个又一个的喜讯，使我非常激动。我这个在旧社会被有钱人踩在脚下的穷苦农民，做梦也没有想到我这双满是厚茧的手，能幸福地握着毛主席的手。毛主席最关心我们，最信任我们，最支持我们，世界上还有谁比我们更幸福？现在我只有一个心愿：一定听毛主席的话。林彪同志说：“人民群众掌握了毛泽东思想，就变得最聪明，最勇敢，就能发挥无穷无尽的力量！”这话说得真对。干革命，千条万条，掌握毛泽东思想是第一条。打仗，搞生产，千条万条，掌握毛泽东思想也是第一条。什么事情按毛主席的指示去办，天大困难都不怕。
    就拿我活捉美国飞贼来说吧！去年九月二十日，美国空中强盗侵犯我们海南岛上空时，气势很凶。但我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的海军航空兵一上天就把它揍了下来。我拿着一根棍子，美国驾驶员史密斯就乖乖地当了我的俘虏。毛主席说，帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎，看样子是可怕的，但实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。这话句句是真理。现在，我们的民兵排在文化大革命中，学习毛主席著作劲头更大，也更勇敢、更有智慧、更有力量了。大家说：不要说个把史密斯，就是十万、百万、上千万的史密斯来了，也只能作我们的俘虏！
    最敬爱的毛主席！我一定好好听你的话，发扬敢闯，敢干，敢革命，敢造反的无产阶级革命精神，用你握过的手，紧握枪杆子保卫无产阶级的江山，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，坚决消灭一切敢于来犯的敌人。
