Our era is one of heroes.

Here, we introduce to you the deeds of Zhao Kai, a pilot in the Air Force and a member of the Communist Party, who was gloriously wounded while safeguarding the lives of the people in a critical moment.

The incident occurred on July 5th. That day, the sky was clear and blue, an ideal day for flight training.

Zhao Kai usually studied Chairman Mao's works diligently. Before each flight, he would select a few sentences from "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to write in his flight diary, using them as guidance for the day's flight.

This time, before the flight, he wrote the following quote from Chairman Mao in his flight diary: "Our responsibility is to the people. Every word, every action, every policy, must be in the interests of the people..."

After taking off, Zhao Kai focused on controlling the aircraft, determined to fly well for the people.

When he reached the designated airspace, Zhao Kai carefully checked all the instrument readings and requested permission from the control tower to begin the maneuvers. After receiving permission, he adjusted the engine to the specified operating state, tilted the aircraft to a 30-degree angle, and began a circular flight. After completing this maneuver, he reviewed the next steps in his mind, checked the aircraft's position, and prepared to enter a 60-degree circular flight.

Everything proceeded according to plan.

According to regulations, when performing the next steep circular flight, the engine must be adjusted to another operating state. Just as the lever was pressed to the braking position, the engine suddenly vibrated, and the engine thrust quickly weakened, causing the altimeter to drop sharply.

The sudden situation stunned the young pilot. In an instant, a phrase from Chairman Mao that he often used came to mind: "We need a passionate yet calm demeanor." He repeatedly reminded himself, "Stay calm! Stay calm!" and reported the situation to the controller. Then, he quickly observed the engine instruments, discovering that the speed was overshooting, but the thrust had completely disappeared, and the aircraft was in a glide state, dropping from 1,400 meters to 600 meters, the situation was extremely critical!

What to do? Should he eject or make an emergency landing? At this moment, Zhao Kai became even more composed. He clearly remembered the words in his flight diary: "Our responsibility is to the people." He decided to follow Chairman Mao's instructions, doing everything possible to save the aircraft and the people's property, and to make a forced landing.

In southern China, the area is crisscrossed by rivers and fields, making a forced landing extremely dangerous. Especially for a new pilot whose skills were not yet fully mastered, this was a serious test.

The aircraft's condition worsened. Zhao Kai pressed his forehead against the windshield, decisively choosing a small piece of flat land in front of a small river as the landing site.

Just as he was about to make the landing preparations, the aircraft's speed suddenly decreased, making it even harder to control. The altitude dropped to 30-40 meters, the situation became even more critical. At this moment, a grove of mulberry trees appeared in front of the aircraft, and in front of the grove was a village with about 30 households. Four or five villagers were working nearby.

Zhao Kai's heart tightened: "No, it can't land in the village!"

At this critical moment, the words "to the people we are responsible" flashed strongly in his mind. Chairman Mao's words produced a tremendous spiritual force in the heart of this young Communist. Time did not allow for hesitation; time required Zhao Kai to make the final decision!

Every pilot knows that when the aircraft has only a minimal gliding speed, any rough maneuver will cause the aircraft to stall. A several-thousand-kilogram aircraft, once it loses speed, the resulting danger is unpredictable. But at this moment, Zhao Kai decided to take the most urgent measures to make the aircraft avoid the village. His mind had only one thought: "Even if I face great danger, I cannot let the people suffer any loss."

He tightly gripped the control stick with his right hand, pressing it to the right; his right leg stomped on the right rudder, turning the aircraft to the right. The aircraft immediately stalled, falling from a height of about ten meters. It bounced up again, flipping over to the right in the field. The safety of the people was ensured, and the aircraft was finally saved.

The villagers who were working in the field immediately rushed to the aircraft to rescue their comrade-in-arms.

Zhao Kai, with multiple injuries to his face, endured the pain, and with his body tilted, exited the cockpit. To prevent any accidents, he repeatedly waved his hand, telling the villagers not to come near. A brigade leader wanted to carry Zhao Kai away, but Zhao Kai anxiously asked, "Are there any injured villagers?" "How much damage has been done to the crops?" and asked the villagers to immediately call the airfield. He insisted on staying by the aircraft to protect the scene. Many people were moved and comforted him, carrying him into the village for treatment.

The deeds of Zhao Kai spread like wildfire through the commune and the county. The villagers rushed to tell each other, and a continuous stream of people came to visit, all saying in emotion, "This is truly a pilot educated by Chairman Mao!" An old poor peasant anxiously asked everyone, "Will this pilot be able to fly again after recovery?" Only after being told that he could fly again did he leave with relief.

Zhao Kai comes from a worker's family. He enlisted in 1959. He loves the Party and Chairman Mao, and persistently studies and applies Chairman Mao's works. In such a complex terrain and extremely urgent situation, he was able to turn danger into safety and successfully make an emergency landing. This is the tremendous power of Mao Zedong Thought, the result of emphasizing politics, and the result of Zhao Kai firmly executing Chairman Mao's instructions and thought revolutionization.

### “向人民负责”——记飞行员赵凯同志光荣负伤的英雄事迹

    “向人民负责”
    ——记飞行员赵凯同志光荣负伤的英雄事迹
    王彭年　王梁栋
    我们的时代，是英雄辈出的时代。
    这里向大家介绍的，是在危急关头为保卫人民生命安全、光荣负伤的空军飞行员、共产党员赵凯同志的事迹。
    事情发生在七月五日。这天晴空万里，正是飞行训练的好天气。
    赵凯同志平时自觉活学活用毛主席著作。每次飞行前，他都要从《毛主席语录》中，有针对性地选择几句话，写在飞行日记本上，做为当天飞行的指导。
    这次飞行前，他照例地在飞行日记本上写上这样一段毛主席语录：“我们的责任，是向人民负责。每句话，每个行动，每项政策，都要适合人民的利益，……。”
    起飞后，赵凯专心地操纵着飞机，决心为人民飞出好的成绩来。
    当飞到预定空域时，赵凯又一次认真检查了各种仪表指示情况，就向塔台指挥员请示进入科目。得到指挥员允许后，赵凯把发动机调整在规定工作状态，将飞机压了一个三十度坡度，做盘旋飞行。做完这个动作后，又默想了一遍下一个动作的要领，检查了飞机的空域位置，准备进入六十度坡度盘旋飞行。
    一切都按计划有条不紊地进行着。
    按规定，做下一个大坡度盘旋时，必须把发动机调整到另一种工作状态。就在手柄刚压到制动位置时，发动机猛然震动起来，发动机拉力很快减弱，飞行高度表指示大幅度下降。
    突如其来的情况，使这位年青的飞行员怔住了。刹那间，他脑子里出现了平时经常爱用的一句毛主席的话：“我们需要的是热烈而镇定的情绪”。他连连提醒自己：“镇定！镇定！”并向指挥员做了报告。接着就敏捷地观察发动机仪表，发现转速超转，可是拉力完全消失，飞机处于空滑状态，从一千四百米高度，急剧降到六百米，情况十分危急！
    怎么办？是跳伞，还是迫降？这时赵凯显得更加镇静了。他清楚地记起飞行日记本上写的毛主席的指示：“我们的责任，是向人民负责。”他决心按照毛主席的指示去做，想尽一切办法保住飞机，保住人民的财产，实行强迫着陆。
    在祖国南方，是河流交错、阡陌纵横的水网地带，强迫着陆是有着极大危险的。特别是对一个技术尚未“过关”的新飞行员来讲，更是个严重的考验。
    飞机的情况越来越坏。赵凯前额紧贴着风挡玻璃，果断地选择了一条小河前面的平地做为迫降场。
    刚做好迫降准备，飞机速度骤然减小，变得更加难以操纵了，高度一下掉到三、四十米，情况更加危急。就在这时，机头前方出现一块桑树林，桑树林的前方，是一个三十来户的村庄。有四、五个社员正在村旁劳动。
    赵凯的心猛地一收缩：“不行，要落到村子里了！”
    就在这万分火急的严重关头，赵凯心中又一次强烈地闪出“向人民负责”这五个大字。毛主席的话，在这个年青共产党员的心灵深处，产生了巨大的精神力量。时间，不允许他犹豫；时间，要赵凯做出最后的决策！
    每个飞行员都清楚地知道，当飞机只有最小的一点空中滑行速度时，操纵动作稍有粗猛，飞机就会失速。几千公斤重的飞机，一旦失去速度，将要发生的危险是难以预料的。但这时，赵凯决定采取最紧急的措施，迫使飞机躲开村庄。他心中只有一个念头：“自己有天大的危险，也不能让人民群众受到损失。”
    他右手紧握驾驶杆，向右猛压，机身一摇晃；右腿猛蹬右舵，机头向右转去。飞机顿时失速，从十来米的高度，跌落下来。又一个跃起，向右翻扣在田里。人民群众的安全保住了，飞机也终于保存下来了。
    正在地里劳动的社员，立刻向飞机奔过来，营救自己的子弟兵。
    面部多处负伤的赵凯，忍着疼痛，侧着身体离开座舱。为了防止发生意外，他一再挥手让社员不要靠近。一位生产队长要背走赵凯，赵凯却焦急地询问：“社员有负伤的没有？”“庄稼受了多少损失？”并请社员立即给机场打电话。他自己坚持要留在飞机旁保护现场。许多群众激动地安慰他，并把他背进村去包扎。
    赵凯同志的事迹，像阵风似的传遍了公社和县城。社员们奔走相告，川流不息地前来探望，都感动地说：“真是毛主席教育出来的好飞行员！”一位老贫农逢人就焦急地问道：“这个飞行员治好了还能上天吗？”直到告诉他可以上天，他才放心地走去。
    赵凯同志出身于工人家庭。一九五九年入伍。他热爱党，热爱毛主席，坚持不懈地活学活用毛主席著作，在地形十分复杂，情况如此紧急的时候，能够化险为夷，成功地迫降，这正是毛泽东思想的巨大威力，是突出政治的成果，是赵凯同志坚定地执行毛主席指示和思想革命化的结果。
