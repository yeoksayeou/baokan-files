Comrades, students:

	First of all, on behalf of our great leader Chairman Mao, I greet you all! On behalf of the Party Central Committee, I greet you all!

	We firmly support your bold, daring, revolutionary, and rebellious proletarian revolutionary spirit!

	This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has Chairman Mao as its supreme commander. Chairman Mao is the commander-in-chief. Under the command of our great commander, if we listen well to our commander—Chairman Mao—this Cultural Revolution will definitely develop smoothly and achieve great victory!

	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution proposed by Chairman Mao is a great innovation in the communist movement and a great innovation in the socialist revolution!

	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution aims to eliminate bourgeois ideology, establish proletarian ideology, transform people's souls, achieve the proletarianization of people's thoughts, uproot the source of revisionism, and consolidate and develop the socialist system.

	We must overthrow those in power who are taking the capitalist road, overthrow the bourgeois reactionary authorities, overthrow all bourgeois conservatives, oppose all forms of suppression of the revolution, and overthrow all monsters and demons!

	We must thoroughly smash all the old ideas, culture, customs, and habits of the exploiting classes, reform all the superstructures that do not conform to the socialist economic base, and sweep away all harmful elements and obstacles!

	We must establish the authority of the proletariat, establish new proletarian ideas, culture, customs, and habits. In a word, we must establish the thought of Mao Zedong. We must let the hundreds of millions of people grasp the thought of Mao Zedong, let the thought of Mao Zedong occupy all ideological positions, use the thought of Mao Zedong to change the spiritual face of the entire society, and turn the great spiritual force of the thought of Mao Zedong into a great material force!

	This Cultural Revolution is a major event concerning the fate of our Party and state, and a major event concerning the future of our Party and state!

	To carry out this Cultural Revolution well, what do we rely on? We rely on the great thought of Mao Zedong and the wisdom and strength of the masses!

	Chairman Mao is the most outstanding leader of the proletariat in contemporary times, the greatest genius of contemporary times. Chairman Mao trusts the masses the most, cares for the masses the most, supports the revolutionary movements of the masses the most, and is heart to heart with the revolutionary masses!

	The thought of Mao Zedong is a new stage in the development of Marxism-Leninism, the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times, the Marxism-Leninism that transforms people's souls in contemporary times, and the most powerful ideological weapon of the proletariat.

	The people are the creators of history. When the people grasp the thought of Mao Zedong, they become the wisest and bravest, and can unleash boundless strength!

	With the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the most powerful weapon of Mao Zedong thought, we can be invincible, conquer all, and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

	The "Decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" recently issued by the Central Committee was formulated under the personal direction of our great leader Chairman Mao. It is the great program of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the latest embodiment of Mao Zedong thought. We must resolutely carry out this decision, mobilize the masses, firmly oppose bureaucratism, and firmly rely on the revolutionary leftists, win over the middle elements, unite the majority, concentrate our forces, and strike down the handful of most reactionary rightists, carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

	The Cultural Revolution is a long-term task. There will be major battles and minor battles, and it will last for a long time. As long as bourgeois ideology exists for one day, we will fight for one day, and we will fight to the end!

	This is a major battle, a general offensive against bourgeois ideology and the forces of all exploiting classes. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we must launch a fierce attack on bourgeois ideology, old customs, and old habits! We must thoroughly overthrow the counter-revolutionary revisionists, the bourgeois rightists, and the bourgeois reactionary authorities, making them lose their prestige and never be able to rise again!

	Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

	Long live the great Chinese people!

	Long live the great Communist Party of China!

	Long live the great thought of Mao Zedong!

	Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!

　　在庆祝无产阶级文化大革命群众大会上
　　林彪同志的讲话同志们，同学们：
    我首先代表我们的伟大领袖毛主席，向大家问好！我代表党中央向大家问好！
    我们坚决地支持你们敢闯、敢干、敢革命、敢造反的无产阶级革命精神！
    这次无产阶级文化大革命，最高司令是我们毛主席。毛主席是统帅。我们在伟大统帅的指挥下，好好地听我们统帅——毛主席的话，文化大革命一定能顺利发展，一定能取得伟大胜利！
    毛主席提出的无产阶级文化大革命，是共产主义运动中的伟大创举，是社会主义革命的伟大创举！
    无产阶级文化大革命，就是要消灭资产阶级思想，树立无产阶级思想，改造人的灵魂，实现人的思想革命化，挖掉修正主义根子，巩固和发展社会主义制度。
    我们要打倒走资本主义道路的当权派，要打倒资产阶级反动权威，要打倒一切资产阶级保皇派，要反对形形色色的压制革命的行为，要打倒一切牛鬼蛇神！
    我们要大破一切剥削阶级的旧思想，旧文化，旧风俗，旧习惯，要改革一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑，我们要扫除一切害人虫，搬掉一切绊脚石！
    我们要大立无产阶级的权威，要大立无产阶级的新思想，新文化，新风俗，新习惯。一句话，就是要大立毛泽东思想。我们要让亿万人民掌握毛泽东思想，让毛泽东思想占领一切思想阵地，用毛泽东思想来改变整个社会的精神面貌，让毛泽东思想这个伟大的精神力量，变成伟大的物质力量！
    这次文化大革命，是关系到我们党和国家命运的大事，是关系到我们党和国家前途的大事！
    要搞好这场文化大革命，靠什么呢？靠伟大的毛泽东思想，靠群众的智慧和力量！
    毛主席是当代无产阶级最杰出的领袖，是当代最伟大的天才。毛主席最相信群众，最关心群众，最支持群众的革命运动，和革命群众心连心！
    毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义发展的一个崭新阶段，是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，是当代改造人们灵魂的马克思列宁主义，是无产阶级最强大的思想武器。
    人民群众是历史的创造者。人民群众掌握了毛泽东思想，就变得最聪明，最勇敢，就能发挥无穷无尽的力量！
    我们有毛主席的英明领导，掌握了毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器，就能够所向披靡，攻无不克，取得无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利！
    最近中央公布的《关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》，是在伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持下制定的，是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大纲领，是毛泽东思想的最新体现。我们一定要坚决按照这个决定办事，要放手发动群众，要坚决反对包办代替，要坚定地依靠革命的左派，争取中间派，团结大多数，集中力量，打击一小撮最反动的右派，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    文化大革命是个长期的任务。这中间有大战役，有小战役，要持续很长的时间。只要资产阶级思想存在一天，我们就要战斗一天，要一直打到底！
    这次是大战役，是对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级思想的总攻击。我们要在毛主席的领导下，向资产阶级意识形态、旧风俗、旧习惯势力，展开猛烈的进攻！要把反革命修正主义分子，把资产阶级右派分子，把资产阶级反动权威，彻底打倒，打垮，使他们威风扫地，永世不得翻身！
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    伟大的中国人民万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的毛泽东思想万岁！
    伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
