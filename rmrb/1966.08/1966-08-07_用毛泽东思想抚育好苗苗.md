We must not allow our descendants to change color.

In the old society, the doors of schools were open to capitalists, landlords, and rich peasants. Poor people's children couldn't even afford elementary school, let alone college. Chairman Mao led us in revolution, overthrowing the three big mountains oppressing us, and seizing the schools from the bureaucrats, landlords, and capitalists. He opened the doors of education to us poor and lower-middle peasants.

However, a handful of bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the education sector are furious about the cultural liberation of the laboring people. They use their authority to promote a revisionist educational line, resisting the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's educational line. Through various channels, they instill bourgeois ideology in students, attempting to turn our schools into breeding grounds for bourgeois counter-revolutionary restoration. This is a struggle between two classes over the next generation. In this struggle, I deeply felt the seriousness of the problem.

In 1955, my daughter Li Xinyu graduated from primary school. With a heart full of excitement, I sent her to middle school. I hoped she would strengthen her ideology and learn skills in school, mastering the proletariat's pen and sword to defend our red homeland. Who would have thought that soon my heart would turn cold. Before, villagers praised her as a hardworking girl. After less than a year in middle school, she began to change. She returned home demanding better food and clothes. After eating, she wouldn't even wash her bowl. When asked to work in the fields, she would always say she had homework or assignments to complete, delaying and procrastinating. When asked about her progress in school, she only talked about grades. I hoped she would become a socialist-conscious, cultured laborer, but she dreamed of leaving the countryside. Her thoughts were misaligned, and her words were irritating. I asked lower-middle peasants Zhang Qiufu and Communist Party member Ma Heze. They said their sons were the same. They were all very angry.

I told the parents of poor and lower-middle peasants: The snakes want to devour our children; we must snatch our children back from the snakes' mouths. They instill bourgeois ideas in our children; we must, following Chairman Mao's teachings, conduct proletarian class education, labor education, and revolutionary tradition education for our children. From then on, whenever the children returned home, we would spend evenings teaching them family history. During vacations, while the school assigned them homework, we also assigned them tasks: studying Chairman Mao's works, learning village and family history, and undergoing labor training.

Thus, they pulled, and we snatched, fighting for two or three years. Our children, though infected with some bourgeois ideas, were at least not lured away by them.

Now, things are different! Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee call on us to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, thoroughly reforming the old educational system. We wholeheartedly support Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's call! We will definitely, following Chairman Mao's teachings, actively participate in the struggle, expelling all bourgeois representatives and ghosts and snakes from the educational sector, never allowing them to continue their evil deeds, never allowing our descendants to change color.

The Most Fundamental Required Course

To turn our schools into breeding grounds for proletarian revolutionary successors, what is taught in schools is a very important issue.

We have long been suspicious of the school's teaching content. One day, I asked Xinyu about her school's teaching situation. She mentioned language, mathematics, geography, history, and a long list of subjects, but she placed political and labor courses last, treating them as mere "show" courses. Teachers lectured, left and right, about "outlines," but there was no teaching outline for Mao Zedong Thought, no teaching outline for class and class struggle. What animal research, plant research, all from books to books, from rooms to rooms. How can this cultivate socialist-conscious, cultured laborers? How can this produce proletarian revolutionary successors!

The editorial in the People's Daily pointed out that teaching content must be reformed, burying all bad textbooks, with new textbooks guided by Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing proletarian politics, from primary school to university, all must study Chairman Mao's books well.

These words truly resonate with our hearts. We say, this required course, that required course, Chairman Mao's works are the most fundamental required course; this important, that important, class and class struggle education is the most important; this activity, that activity, production labor is the most urgent. Only by educating children from the roots in this way can the bourgeois poison be thoroughly eradicated, and true proletarian revolutionary successors be cultivated. As the saying goes, "A young tree not pruned will not grow straight, a child not taught will not grow right." We discovered the problem when Xinyu went to middle school, so we immediately paid attention to the children in primary school, wanting them to read Chairman Mao's books from a young age, to receive education on the three great revolutionary struggles. Every year during holidays, I would always tell the children about class struggle history, production struggle history, conducting class education, labor education, and revolutionary tradition education.

In 1964, I proposed to our village's primary school to make studying Chairman Mao's books a required course for students. Children love to read Chairman Mao's books and listen to Chairman Mao's words the most.

The other day, I met four children around ten years old who were carrying baskets to collect manure on their way to school. After filling a basket, they would dump it in the collective fields. I deliberately said to them, "You dump the manure in the collective fields, and the brigade leader will give you work points when you return." They all replied, "We learn from White seekers, collecting manure is for the revolution, not for work points." On June 25 this year, it rained heavily, and the children saw that the wheat by the reservoir had just been harvested but not completely picked. They feared that the collective property would be damaged, so they asked the teacher for permission to go to the fields to pick wheat.

With such a spirit at a young age, it shows that they are all good seedlings nurtured by the sunshine and rain of Mao Zedong Thought.

Receiving the "Thought Graduation Certificate"

All bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the Party, ghosts and snakes, reactionary bourgeois "experts," "scholars," and "authorities" are extremely afraid of the worker-peasant-soldier masses. To cultivate bourgeois counter-revolutionary successors, they always try every means to make young students detach from the broad worker-peasant-soldier masses, detach from the practice of the three great revolutionary struggles. And young students, if they do not combine with the worker-peasant-soldier masses, do not undergo the tempering of the practice of the three great revolutionary struggles, will be corrupted by the bourgeoisie. Therefore, young students should not only receive a "graduation certificate" for their studies in school but also go to the worker-peasant-soldier masses, go to the practice of the three great revolutionary struggles to receive a "thought graduation certificate."

In the summer of 1962, my daughter Xinyu graduated from junior high school. She proudly showed me her "graduation certificate" and said, "Dad, I graduated!" I said, "No, you haven't graduated. You haven't received the 'thought graduation certificate' given by the poor and lower-middle peasants. To receive this 'certificate,' you need at least another three years." Then, I assigned her three courses: first, personally giving her four volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," asking her to read them from cover to cover; second, personally giving her a large hoe I once used, letting her practice hard labor skills, always remembering that she is a child of the laboring people; third, letting her practice combat skills to defend the socialist homeland. That year, our brigade's other eight students who graduated from junior high and returned to the village, we also gave them the same education.

In the three great revolutionary movements, batch after batch of returning young students tempered their thoughts, increased their abilities, and strengthened their physiques. Since 1959, our brigade has had 27 people who graduated from middle school and returned to the village, and 85 who graduated from primary school. After three to five years of tempering, they all grew up healthily. Among these young people, 15 received the "thought graduation certificate" given by the masses, advanced in their studies, joined the army, worked in factories and offices. On their new posts, they are mostly "three-good students," "five-good soldiers," "six-good workers," or advanced workers. Forty-five people in the brigade and production teams took on leadership roles. Like our brigade's young Party branch secretary, women's director, and militia battalion commander, they are all vanguards of class struggle, labor heroes, and pioneers of scientific experiments. My daughter Xinyu also tempered herself to be red in thought, strong in labor, and accurate in shooting, and was elected by the Young Pioneers as the brigade's Youth League branch secretary.

Seeing this group of young people who read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, we, the older generation of poor and lower-middle peasants, have an indescribable joy in our hearts. Imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries dream of restoring capitalism in our third and fourth generations. The black gangs and bourgeois "authorities" who oppose the Party and socialism attempt to cultivate successors for bourgeois counter-revolutionary restoration. Tell these reactionaries, you are dreaming in broad daylight!

    用毛泽东思想抚育好苗苗
    全国农业劳动模范　李顺达
    绝不让我们的后代变色
    旧社会，学校的大门是朝资本家、地主、富农开的。穷人家的孩子连小学都上不起，上大学更是没有份。毛主席领导我们闹革命，推翻了压在我们头上的三座大山，把学校从官僚、地主、资本家的手里夺了回来，给我们贫下中农子弟上学开了门。
    可是，一小撮钻到教育界的资产阶级代表人物，对我们劳动人民在文化上大翻身恨得咬牙切齿。他们利用职权，千方百计推行修正主义的教育路线，抵制党中央和毛主席的教育路线。他们通过各种途径，向学生灌输剥削阶级的思想意识，妄图把我们的学校办成为资产阶级反革命复辟培养接班人的学校。这是一场两个阶级争夺下一代的斗争。在这场斗争中我深深感到了问题的严重性。
    一九五五年，我女儿李新娥高小毕业了。我怀着激动的心情，把她送到中学去念书。满想她在学校里炼好思想，学好本领，掌握好无产阶级的刀把子和笔杆子，保卫我们的红色江山。谁想，不久就使我的心凉了半截。以前，村里人都夸她是个爱劳动的好姑娘。住了中学以后，不到一年，她就开始变了。回家来要吃好的，穿好的。吃了饭连碗也不洗。让她下地劳动，她总是说要做什么作业呀、功课呀，推三托四。问她到学校后有什么提高，她说的除了分数还是分数。我希望她能成为一个有社会主义觉悟、有文化的劳动者，可是她想的是离开农村。思想不对路，说话就不对味，真使人生气。我问下中农张秋富和共产党员马何则，他们说他们的儿子也是这个样子。他们也都非常生气。
    我同贫下中农家长们说：毒蛇们要把我们的子女吞掉，我们要从毒蛇嘴里把子女夺回来；他们向我们的子女灌输资产阶级那一套，我们要按毛主席的教导，向子女们进行无产阶级的阶级教育、劳动教育和革命传统教育。打那以后，孩子们回家来，我们就抽晚上时间给他们讲家史。假期学校给他们布置作业，我们也给他们布置作业：学习毛主席著作，学习村史和家史，进行劳动锻炼。
    这样，他们拉，我们夺，斗争了二、三年，我们的子女虽也中了一些资产阶级思想的毒，可是总算没有被他们拉走。
    现在可好啦！毛主席和党中央号召我们进行无产阶级文化大革命，彻底改革旧的教育制度。对于毛主席和党中央的号召，我们一千个拥护，一万个拥护！我们一定要按照毛主席的教导，积极参加斗争，把教育界的资产阶级代表人物、牛鬼蛇神统统清除掉，决不允许他们继续作恶，决不允许我们的后代变色。
      最根本的必修课
    要把我们的学校，办成培养无产阶级革命接班人的学校，学校里教啥东西，是一个非常重要的问题。
    我们对学校的教学内容早就发生了怀疑。一天，我问新娥学校的教学情况。她讲了语文课、数学课、地理课、历史课一大串，却把政治课和劳动课排在最后，当成两门
  “装样子”课。教员讲课，左一个“大纲”，右一个“大纲”，就是没有毛泽东思想的教学大纲，没有阶级和阶级斗争教学大纲。什么动物研究，植物研究，都是从书本到书本，室里来室里去。这怎么能培养出有社会主义觉悟、有文化的劳动者，这怎么能造就出无产阶级的革命接班人！
    《人民日报》社论指出，教学内容要改革，要把那些不好的教材统统埋葬，新教材必须以毛泽东思想为指导，突出无产阶级政治，从初小到大学都要好好学习毛主席的书。
    这话真是说在我们心坎上了。我们说，这必修课，那必修课，毛主席著作才是最根本的必修课；这重要，那重要，阶级和阶级斗争的教育最重要；这活动，那活动，生产劳动最当紧。只有打根儿上起就这样教育孩子，才能把资产阶级的流毒彻底肃清，才能培养出真正的无产阶级革命接班人。俗话说得好：“小树不修不成材，小孩不教不成人。”我们从新娥上中学发现了问题，就马上对在小学念书的孩子们操上了心，要让他们从小就念毛主席的书，就受三大革命斗争的教育。每年的节日，我总要给孩子们讲阶级斗争史，生产斗争史，进行阶级教育、劳动教育和革命传统教育。
    一九六四年，我又给我们村里的小学提议，把学习毛主席的书，作为学生的必修课。孩子们最爱读毛主席的书，最听毛主席的话。
    前几天，我碰见四个十岁左右的孩子，上学时抬着箩头拾粪。拾满一箩头，就倒在集体地里。我故意向他们说：“你们把粪倒在集体地里，回去让队长给你们记上工分。”他们一齐回答说：“我们学习白求恩，拾粪是为了革命，不是为了工分。”今年六月二十五日，天下大雨，孩子们看到水库边的麦子刚割完，还没有拾净麦穗。他们怕集体财产受损失，就向老师请求，到地里去拾麦穗。
    小小的年纪有这样的精神面貌，说明他们全是毛泽东思想的阳光雨露抚育出来的好苗苗。
    领取“思想毕业证”
    一切钻进党内的资产阶级代表人物，牛鬼蛇神，反动的资产阶级
  “专家”、“学者”、“权威”，都非常害怕工农兵群众。他们为了培养资产阶级反革命的接班人，总是千方百计地使青年学生脱离广大工农兵群众，脱离三大革命斗争的实践。而青年学生，如果不和工农兵群众结合，不去经受三大革命斗争实践的锻炼，就会被资产阶级所腐蚀。因此，青年学生，不光要在学校里领取学业的“毕业证”，而且应当到工农兵群众中，到三大革命斗争的实践中去领取思想的“毕业证”。
    一九六二年夏天，我的女儿新娥初中毕业了。她拿着“毕业证书”高高兴兴地对我说：“爸爸，我毕业了！”我说：“不，你没有毕业。你还没有领到贫下中农发给你的‘思想毕业证’，要领这张‘毕业证’至少还得三年。”接着，我就给她布置了三门课：第一，亲手交给四本《毛泽东选集》，要她从头到尾通读；第二，亲手交给她我曾经使用过的一把大镢头，让她练过硬的劳动本领，永远记住自己是劳动人民的子女；第三，要她练好杀敌本领，保卫社会主义江山。这一年，我们大队从初中毕业返乡的其他八名学生，我们也对他们进行了同样的教育。
    烈火炼真金。在三大革命运动中，一伙一伙返乡的青年学生，锻炼了思想，增长了才干，增强了体质。自一九五九年以来，我们大队从中学毕业返乡的二十七人，高小毕业的八十五人。他们各自经过三年、五年的锻炼，都健壮地成长起来了。在这些青年中，有十五人领到群众发给的“思想毕业证”，升了学，参了军，进了工厂和机关工作。他们在新的岗位上，大多是“三好学生”，“五好战士”，“六好职工”或先进工作者。有四十五人在大队、生产队担任了干部。象我们大队年轻的党支部书记、妇女主任、民兵营长等，都是阶级斗争的先锋，生产劳动的能手，科学实验的闯将。我的女儿新娥也锻炼得思想红，劳动强，枪法准，被共青团员们选为大队的团支部书记。
    看着这一群读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事的生龙活虎的青年人，我们老一辈贫下中农心里有说不出的高兴。帝国主义、修正主义和反动派妄想在我们的第三代、第四代复辟资本主义，反党反社会主义的黑帮和资产阶级的“权威”老爷们，妄图为资本主义反革命复辟培养接班人。告诉你们这些反动家伙，那是白日作梦！
