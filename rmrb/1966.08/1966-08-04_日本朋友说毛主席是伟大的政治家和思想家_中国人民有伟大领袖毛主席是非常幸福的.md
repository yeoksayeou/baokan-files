A Japanese friend says Chairman Mao is a great politician and thinker
The Chinese people are very fortunate to have the great leader Chairman Mao

	According to Xinhua News Agency in Guangzhou, the honorary chairman of the Japan Swimming Federation, Tanabatake Seiji, recently spoke to our reporter before his departure, expressing his feelings about his visit to China. He said, "Chairman Mao is a great thinker and philosopher. Such a great figure has not appeared in several centuries." He said, "The Chinese people having such a great leader as Chairman Mao is very fortunate."

	Tanabatake Seiji said, "We have seen with our own eyes that the Chinese people love Chairman Mao." "The Chinese people say: 'Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts.' I think this sentence fully expresses the Chinese people's love for Chairman Mao."

	Tanabatake Seiji said, "Chairman Mao is a great thinker and philosopher. Chairman Mao is not only a theorist but has established his authority through his own decades of personal practice, which is trusted by the people. Therefore, the Chinese people love, trust, and respect Chairman Mao." He said, "Chairman Mao is not only an outstanding thinker but undoubtedly an excellent politician, military strategist, and a great poet. Such a great figure has not appeared in several centuries. Therefore, I think the Chinese people having such a great leader is very fortunate."

	Tanabatake Seiji praised Chairman Mao, saying, "To unite a country as vast as China with a population of 700 million and to change the spiritual outlook of the people, I think this is extraordinary." He said, "Some countries hope that the next generation of China might change color, but I feel that because the Chinese youth are educated in Mao Zedong Thought, their expectations will definitely be completely disappointed and fail."

	When talking about the development of sports in New China, Tanabatake Seiji believes that Chinese athletes, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, completely disregard personal fame and fortune and establish the ambition to bring glory to the motherland. Therefore, the development of Chinese sports will be faster than that of the West.

    日本朋友说毛主席是伟大的政治家和思想家
    中国人民有伟大领袖毛主席是非常幸福的
    据新华社广州电　日本游泳联盟名誉会长田畑政治最近在归国以前向本社记者畅谈访华观感的时候说，毛主席是一个伟大的思想家和哲学家，象毛主席这样的伟大人物，是几个世纪来都没有出现过的。他说，中国人民有毛主席这样的伟大领袖是非常幸福的。
    田畑政治说：“我们亲眼看到，中国人民是热爱毛主席的”，“中国人民说：‘毛主席是我们心中的红太阳’，我认为这句话完全表达了中国人民热爱毛主席的心情。”
    田畑政治说：“毛主席是一个伟大的思想家和哲学家。毛主席不仅是个理论家，而是通过自己几十年的亲身实践树立了威信，这种威信被人民所信任。因此，中国人民热爱毛主席，信赖毛主席，崇敬毛主席。”他说：“毛主席不但是一个非常杰出的思想家，而且毫无疑问是一个非常出色的政治家、军事家，又是一个伟大的诗人。象这样一个伟大人物，是几个世纪来没有出现过的”，“因此我认为，中国人民有这样伟大的领袖是非常幸福的。”
    田畑政治赞扬毛主席说：“把象中国这样一个幅员辽阔、有七亿人口的国家统一起来，并把人民的精神面貌改变过来，我认为这是不寻常的。”他说：“有些国家指望中国的下一代可能会改变颜色，但我感到，由于中国青年受到毛泽东思想的教育，他们的这种期待必定会完全落空和失败。”
    在谈到新中国体育运动事业的发展时，田畑政治认为，中国运动员由于在毛泽东思想教导下完全不考虑个人名利而树立了为祖国争光的雄心壮志，因而中国体育运动的发展会比西方更快。
