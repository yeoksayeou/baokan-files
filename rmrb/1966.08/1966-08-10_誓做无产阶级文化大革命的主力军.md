The wise decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is a new victory of Mao Zedong Thought, a summary and programmatic document of the proletarian cultural revolution, a fundamental guarantee for our complete victory in the proletarian cultural revolution, and a great contribution to the world proletarian revolution. It points out the fundamental path for the proletarian cultural revolution in our country and will push the proletarian cultural revolution in our country into a new stage. This wise decision calls on us, revolutionary teachers and students, especially revolutionary youth students, to be the masters of the proletarian cultural revolution. This is your boundless trust and care for us, which greatly boosts our revolutionary spirit. We feel full of energy and courage. Under your wise leadership and affectionate care, the proletarian cultural revolution preparatory committee of our department has been established, and we have truly become the masters of the proletarian cultural revolution. We will not disappoint your expectations. We will resolutely follow your words; whatever you say, we will do. We will definitely take Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding direction for all our work, take your wise decision as our sharpest weapon, carry forward the fearless revolutionary spirit of "daring to pull the emperor off his horse," and dare to climb the mountain of knives and plunge into the sea of fire! We are determined, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory. We will carry out the proletarian cultural revolution thoroughly and deeply!

Long live the most beloved leader, Chairman Mao!  Lake North University Law Department All Revolutionary Teachers and Students
