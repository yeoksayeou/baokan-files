A Great Joy for the People of the Whole Nation

In response to the urgent demands of the broad masses, the Party Central Committee has decided that the Ministry of Culture will immediately take revolutionary measures to mobilize forces from all sides to print and distribute large quantities of various editions of Chairman Mao's works. This is a great joy for the people of the whole nation! This is another great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and cadres love Chairman Mao's books the most. They compare Mao Zedong's books to food, weapons, and steering wheels, regarding them as their guide for all actions.

Reading Chairman Mao's books has become the primary political need of the Chinese people. Hundreds of millions of people are eager to study Mao Zedong's works, consciously using Mao Zedong Thought to transform both the subjective and objective worlds. This is a great mass movement, a widespread dissemination of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and an unprecedented feat in the history of the communist movement over the past century. This movement has opened a new era in which the working people directly grasp Marxism-Leninism.

Once the broad masses of the people are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, they will have boundless revolutionary courage and wisdom, and they will be able to generate boundless revolutionary power. With Mao Zedong Thought as the unified, correct, and revolutionary ideology, the seven hundred million people will definitely be able to carry the socialist revolution to the end and will definitely be able to promote the continuous victory of socialist construction in our country.

In the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works extensively. They learn and apply in the struggle. They use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fight against those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, to criticize the reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, to criticize the ideology of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, to reform the educational system and educational policies, methods, and to reform all superstructures that do not adapt to the socialist economic base. The spiritual face of the Chinese people is undergoing unprecedented great changes.

This situation has put forward new and higher requirements for the publication of Chairman Mao's works. Although we have done a lot of work in the past, printing and distributing a considerable number of various editions of Chairman Mao's works and quotations, which have been warmly welcomed by the broad masses, many people carry the "Little Red Book" with them and study it at any time. However, the number of books printed and distributed in the past is still far from meeting the actual needs of the broad masses and still lags far behind the demands of the masses.

The broad masses' enthusiasm for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has, for a period of time, been obstructed by anti-Party and anti-socialist black gangs. This small handful of black gang members harbor deep hatred for Mao Zedong Thought. They are extremely afraid of Mao Zedong Thought meeting the broad masses and slander the broad workers, peasants, and soldiers studying Chairman Mao's works as "vulgarization," "simplification," and "pragmatism." In the regions and units where they control the leadership, they also find various excuses to restrict the printing and distribution of Chairman Mao's works, attempting to deprive the broad masses of the right to study Chairman Mao's works.

The more the class enemies hate Mao Zedong Thought, the more we love Mao Zedong Thought. The more they obstruct Mao Zedong Thought from meeting the broad masses, the more we must better propagate Mao Zedong Thought, the more we must print and distribute large quantities of Chairman Mao's works, and send Chairman Mao's works to tens of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Taking revolutionary measures, in more than a year, to print and distribute 35 million copies of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and a large number of "Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong" and Chairman Mao's quotations, is a glorious, great, and arduous task. The urgent need of the broad masses for Chairman Mao's works will be further satisfied. However, our country is a country with a population of seven hundred million, and the movement of the masses studying Chairman Mao's works is becoming more and more widespread, so it is not something that can be achieved in a short period of time to fully meet the needs of hundreds of millions of people for Chairman Mao's works, and continuous and unremitting efforts must be made.

The Chinese people are filled with boundless excitement, welcoming the large-scale printing and distribution of Chairman Mao's works. It can be completely believed that the hundreds of millions of people in our country will definitely be able to turn the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works into a great material force to transform the face of our motherland. A country with one-fourth of the world's population becoming a great school for studying Mao Zedong Thought, and further and more widely popularizing Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, will make our proletarian dictatorship socialist country unchangeable and will make greater and greater contributions to the revolutionary movement of the people of the world.

    全国人民的大喜事
    根据广大群众的迫切要求，党中央决定，由文化部立即采取革命化的措施，动员各方面的力量，大量印刷发行各种版本的毛主席著作。这是全国人民的一件大喜事！这是无产阶级文化大革命的又一个巨大胜利！
    广大工农兵、革命知识分子和广大干部，对毛主席的书最热爱。他们把毛主席的书比作粮食、武器、方向盘，当作自己一切行动的指南。
    读毛主席的书，已经成为我国人民政治生活的第一需要。亿万人民如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作，自觉地用毛泽东思想来改造主观世界和客观世界。这是一个伟大的群众运动，是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的大普及，是一百多年来共产主义运动历史上空前未有的壮举。这个运动开创了劳动人民直接掌握马克思列宁主义的新纪元。
    广大人民群众一旦用毛泽东思想武装起来，就有了无穷的革命勇气和革命智慧，就能产生无穷的革命力量。七亿人民有了毛泽东思想这个统一的思想、正确的思想、革命的思想，我们就一定能够把我国社会主义革命进行到底，就一定能够推动我国社会主义建设不断取得胜利。
    在当前的无产阶级文化大革命中，广大群众高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大学大用毛主席著作。他们在斗争中学，在斗争中用。他们以毛泽东思想为武器，斗争那些党内走资本主义道路的当权派，批判资产阶级的反动学术“权威”，批判资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的意识形态，改革教育制度和教育方针、方法，改革一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑。我国人民的精神面貌正在发生前所未有的巨大变化。
    这种情况，对毛主席著作的出版工作，提出了新的更高的要求。尽管过去我们做了大量的工作，印刷发行了相当数量的各种版本的毛主席著作和语录，受到了广大群众的热烈欢迎。很多人都是“语录身上带，随时学起来”。但是过去印刷发行的数量，同广大群众的实际需要比较起来，还是相差很远很远，仍然大大落后于群众的要求。
    广大群众活学活用毛主席著作的热潮，在一段时间内，曾经受到反党反社会主义黑帮分子的阻挠。这一小撮黑帮分子对毛泽东思想抱有刻骨的仇恨。他们极端害怕毛泽东思想同广大群众见面，诬蔑广大工农兵学习毛主席著作是“庸俗化”、“简单化”、“实用主义”。在他们控制了领导权的地区和单位，他们还找各种借口，限制毛主席著作的印刷发行，妄图剥夺广大群众学习毛主席著作的权利。
    阶级敌人越是仇视毛泽东思想，我们就越是热爱毛泽东思想。他们越是阻挠毛泽东思想和广大群众见面，我们就越要更好地宣传毛泽东思想，越要大量印刷发行毛主席著作，把毛主席著作送到千千万万工农兵群众中去。
    采取革命的措施，在一年多的时间里，印刷发行三千五百万部《毛泽东选集》和大量的《毛泽东著作选读》和毛主席语录，这是光荣、伟大而又艰巨的任务。广大群众对毛主席著作的迫切需要，将会进一步得到解决。但是，我国是一个七亿人口的大国，学习毛主席著作的群众运动越来越高涨，因此，要完全满足几亿人民对毛主席著作的需要，不是很短期间可以做到的，必须进行持续不懈的努力。
    我国人民怀着无比兴奋的心情，欢呼毛主席著作的大量印刷发行。完全可以相信，我国亿万人民活学活用毛主席著作，掌握毛泽东思想，就一定能够转化成为改造我们祖国面貌的巨大物质力量。占世界人口四分之一的国度成为学习毛泽东思想的大学校，更深入地、更广泛地普及马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，就会使我们这个无产阶级专政的社会主义国家永不变色，并且对世界人民的革命运动作出越来越大的贡献。
