The news of Chairman Mao and millions of revolutionary masses celebrating the joyous tidings of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution reached the frontline artillery unit in Fujian. The battlefield immediately resounded with drums and gongs, and the shouts of slogans and cheers echoed through the valleys. Zheng Bin, a soldier of humble origins, excitedly clapped his hands and jumped around. This soldier, praised by everyone as a vanguard of the Cultural Revolution, had written dozens of articles in recent months denouncing and criticizing the anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought black gangs. He frequently and actively propagated Mao Zedong Thought among the local populace. He had deep feelings for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. When the radio broadcasted our most respected leader, Chairman Mao, dressed in a simple green military uniform, standing tall and spirited on Tiananmen Gate, Zheng Bin and his comrades felt as if they were seeing Chairman Mao in person. Their hearts burned with warmth, tears of joy welled up, and they tightly embraced their comrades, jumping and shouting together, "Chairman Mao has come! Chairman Mao has come! Long live Chairman Mao!"

Lin Biao's call to uphold Mao Zedong Thought further stirred everyone's emotions. They expressed their determination to immediately take action and, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, launch a new wave of studying Chairman Mao's works. They would use Mao Zedong Thought to sweep away all bourgeois thoughts. Hou Guoru, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, listened to Lin Biao's call and couldn't calm down for a long time. He opened Chairman Mao's works and studied for over three hours. He said, "Mao Zedong Thought is the magic weapon of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the sharpest weapon to overthrow all bourgeois thoughts. I resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, to better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, to transform myself, and in the struggle, to uphold Mao Zedong Thought, criticize bourgeois thoughts, and forge myself into a red successor of the proletariat, forever following the great helmsman Chairman Mao in making revolution."

The Aspirations of Young and Old Soldiers

On the morning of the 18th, from the moment Chairman Mao ascended Tiananmen Gate, the wards of the General Hospital of the Shenyang Military Region began to buzz with excitement: "Chairman Mao, dressed in military uniform, has ascended Tiananmen Gate!" The convalescents who first heard the broadcast quickly spread this heart-stirring news. Immediately, the wards echoed with the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" Whether it was the old Red Army veterans who had followed Chairman Mao through countless battles or the new soldiers who had just donned military uniforms, everyone was moved to tears.

Zhang Chunyu, a soldier armed with Mao Zedong Thought, immediately held a discussion with the comrades convalescing in the hospital after listening to the broadcast. He opened his "East is Red" diary and "Quotations from Chairman Mao," holding Chairman Mao's photo in military uniform and Chairman Mao's portrait in his hands. The comrades tightly gathered around Chairman Mao's portrait, singing "The East is Red." Chen Yi, the deputy commander of a military sub-district who was convalescing in the hospital, had an unusual mood after listening to the broadcast. He was an old Red Army veteran who had participated in five counter-encirclement campaigns and followed Chairman Mao on the Long March. At that time, he lay in bed receiving an IV drip while wearing earphones to listen to the broadcast. He said, "It's important to receive an IV drip for the body, but it's even more important to receive an IV drip for the mind." The news of Chairman Mao, dressed in military uniform, ascending Tiananmen Gate to meet with millions of revolutionary masses made him extremely excited. He visited several nearby wards, telling everyone he met, "I will forever follow Chairman Mao, resolutely implement the Sixteen Points, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end."

The Oath of Border Soldiers

On the 19th, in the barracks of the Third Company of a certain unit in the Inner Mongolia Military Region, a soldier holding a newspaper with a large photo of Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao and news of the celebration of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the capital shouted, "Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao!" This voice immediately spread throughout the company. The soldiers' hearts echoed with the same voice: "The great leader of all ethnic peoples, Chairman Mao, we wish you eternal life!"

Holding Chairman Mao's works in both hands, Hui ethnic soldier Jin Chen said excitedly, "I will definitely study your book well, transform my thoughts, and change the spiritual face of society." The Mongolian ethnic company leader Adiya, a five-good soldier, said, "I will definitely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, use Mao Zedong Thought to sweep away all old thoughts, old culture, old customs, and old habits, and use Mao Zedong Thought to build a brand-new world."

At the discussion meeting, Wu Yutian, a five-good soldier for three consecutive years, recited a poem he wrote:

	"Chairman Mao, dressed in green military uniform, stands on the majestic Tiananmen Gate, just like in the revolutionary war years, commanding us to fight against the enemy. Great leader, great helmsman, great navigator—our most beloved Chairman Mao, your words we will always keep in our hearts, where you point, we will fight, we will definitely carry the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle to the end, we will definitely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and carry the socialist revolution to the end!"

    永远跟着毛主席闹革命
    前线战士的决心
    毛主席和百万革命群众一起庆祝无产阶级文化大革命的喜讯，传到了福建前线炮兵某连。阵地上顿时锣鼓喧天，口号声、欢呼声震撼山谷。贫民出身的战士郑斌石兴奋地拍手、跳跃起来了。这个被大家称赞为文化大革命闯将的五好战士，几个月来，先后写了几十篇声讨和批判反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的黑帮的文章，并经常积极地到驻地群众中宣传毛泽东思想。他对毛主席，对毛泽东思想有着深厚的感情。当广播里传出我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席，穿着一身朴素的草绿色布军装，神采奕奕地登上天安门城楼时，郑斌石和战友们就像亲眼看见毛主席一样，只感到心里热乎乎的，含着热泪，紧紧地抱着战友蹦呀跳呀，同大家一起不断地高喊：“毛主席来了！毛主席来了！祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
    林彪同志在讲话中发出的大立毛泽东思想的伟大号召，更使大家激动，他们表示，要立即行动起来，在无产阶级文化大革命中，进一步掀起学习毛主席著作的新高潮，用毛泽东思想横扫一切资产阶级思想。学习毛主席著作积极分子侯国如，听了林彪同志号召，心情久久平静不下来，他翻开毛主席著作，一连学习了三个多小时。他说：毛泽东思想是无产阶级文化大革命的法宝，是斗倒一切资产阶级思想最锐利的武器，我坚决响应林彪同志号召，更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，改造自己，在斗争中大立毛泽东思想，批判资产阶级，把自己锻炼成无产阶级的红色接班人，永远跟着伟大统帅毛主席闹革命。
    小将老将的心愿
    十八日早晨，从毛主席登上天安门城楼那一刻起，沈阳部队总医院的病房里就开始沸腾起来：“毛主席穿着军衣登上天安门了！”最先听到广播的休养员们就把这一振奋人心的消息传开了。顿时，“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”的口号声响彻了病室。不管是跟随毛主席身经百战的老红军，还是穿上军衣不久的新战士，听着听着都激动得热泪盈眶。
    毛泽东思想武装起来的硬骨头战士张春玉听完广播，立即同在医院休养的同志座谈。他翻开“东方红”日记本，和《毛主席语录》，把毛主席当年穿红军服的照片和毛主席像捧在手里，同志们紧紧围在毛主席像前，唱起了《大海航行靠舵手》。正在医院休养的某军分区副司令员陈仪，听了广播，心情更不寻常。他是参加过五次反围剿、跟随毛主席长征的老红军战士。当时他躺在病床上一面输液，一面戴着耳机听广播，他说：“身体输液重要，思想‘输液’更重要。”毛主席穿着军装登上天安门会见百万革命群众的消息，使他万分激动。他走遍了附近几个病室，逢人就讲。他说：我要永远跟着毛主席，坚决贯彻十六条，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    边疆战士的誓言
    十九日，在内蒙古军区某部三连的驻地，一个战士拿着刊载毛主席和林彪同志巨幅照片和首都庆祝无产阶级文化大革命大会消息的报纸，高声喊：“毛主席！毛主席！”这声音立刻传遍了全连。战士们从内心发出了同一个声音：“各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席，我们祝你万寿无疆！”
    回族战士金椿双手捧着毛主席著作，激动地说：“我一定好好学习你的书，改造自己的思想，改变社会的精神面貌。”五好战士、蒙古族班长阿迪亚说：“我一定响应林彪同志号召，用毛泽东思想扫除一切旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，用毛泽东思想建立一个崭新的世界。”
    在座谈会上，连续三年的“五好”战士吴育田朗诵了自己写的一首诗：
      “毛主席穿着草绿色的军装，站在雄伟的天安门上，就像革命战争年代，指挥我们和敌人战斗一样。伟大的领袖，伟大的统帅，伟大的舵手——我们最最敬爱的毛主席，你的话，我们牢牢记在心里，你指到哪里，我们就打到哪里，一定把反帝反修斗争进行到底，一定把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把社会主义革命进行到底！”
