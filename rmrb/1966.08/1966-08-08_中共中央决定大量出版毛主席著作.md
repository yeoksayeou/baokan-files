To meet the urgent need of the broad masses of the people to study Mao Zedong Thought, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to accelerate the massive publication of the works of Chairman Mao. It calls on the broad cadres and workers of the publishing, printing, and distribution departments across the country to immediately mobilize and spare no effort to make the publication and distribution of the works of Chairman Mao the overriding task. Through accelerated mass printing over the next two years, the works of Chairman Mao, which the broad masses have long yearned for, will gradually be made available nationwide.

Recently, the Ministry of Culture, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, convened a national conference on the printing and distribution of the works of Chairman Mao. It formulated specific plans for the mass printing of the works of Chairman Mao and distribution plans. The "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" will be printed in 35 million copies over the next two years. The "Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong" and individual volumes will generally be printed by the provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions themselves, gradually meeting the needs of the broad masses over the next two years.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's decision to accelerate the massive publication and distribution of the works of Chairman Mao is a major historical event in our country's political life, a great joy for the people of the entire nation, and another victory in the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Recently, the Ministry of Culture, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, convened a national conference on the printing and distribution of the works of Chairman Mao in Beijing. The conference required the publishing, printing, and distribution departments across the country to immediately take revolutionary measures, spare no effort to accelerate the mass printing of the works of Chairman Mao, and gradually make the works of Chairman Mao available nationwide to meet the urgent needs of the broad workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals to study the works of Chairman Mao.

In recent years, since the movement to study and apply the works of Chairman Mao actively has been carried out nationwide among the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals, the contradiction between supply and demand for the works of Chairman Mao has been very prominent. Due to the fact that the anti-party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought black gang has controlled the power of many propaganda and publishing departments, they have created various excuses to limit the number of copies of the works of Chairman Mao published, thus further aggravating the situation of insufficient supply of the works of Chairman Mao. This situation has caused strong dissatisfaction among the broad masses of the people. To fundamentally change the situation where the publication and distribution of the works of Chairman Mao are seriously lagging behind the situation and the needs of the masses, the conference requires the publishing, printing, and distribution departments at all levels to rely on the leadership of the Party committees at all levels, fully mobilize the masses, mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of all employees, and with the spirit of self-reliance, overcome all difficulties. Let all printing plants that have the conditions to print the works of Chairman Mao undertake the glorious political task of printing the works of Chairman Mao, and adopt the method of concentrating forces to fight a battle of annihilation, spare no effort to expand the number of copies of the works of Chairman Mao printed.

During the conference, Zhang Pinghua, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke.

Representatives from publishing, printing, and distribution units and relevant departments from various places reflected the high attention given by local Party committees to this conference and the firm resolve of the broad masses of workers. The representatives all expressed their unparalleled revolutionary enthusiasm and actively requested the conference to assign them more tasks. Many units that obtained the glorious right to print the works of Chairman Mao for the first time were even more enthusiastic. The representatives of these units said excitedly and proudly: "Printing the works of Chairman Mao is a revolutionary need, a task of the highest honor, urgency, and importance assigned to us by the times. Even if there are enormous difficulties, we are not afraid, and we will definitely complete the task!"

The representatives listed a large number of moving examples, reflecting the deep respect and love of the broad masses of the people across the country for the great leader Chairman Mao, their boundless love, faith, and admiration for Mao Zedong Thought, and their urgent desire to buy the works of Chairman Mao. They read out some of the letters from the masses brought by them. These letters reflected the moving scenes of the millions of revolutionary masses across the country eagerly and frantically buying the works of Chairman Mao. Many workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and students went out to buy the works of Chairman Mao, seizing every opportunity, determined to buy the books of Chairman Mao. Many who did not have books copied the articles and quotations of Chairman Mao day and night, all night long. Lu Jindou, an active learner of the works of Chairman Mao from the Electronic Instrument Factory in Yingkou City, Liaoning Province, has been copying the first three volumes of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in the same size as the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" since 1960, word for word, neatly. Some masses could not describe their urgent need for the works of Chairman Mao, and could only write "Wait! Wait! Wait!!!" "Quick! Quick! Quick!!!" in large letters in their letters. Many workers, peasants, and soldiers directly wrote letters to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao requesting: immediately order the publishing and distribution departments to print a large number of Chairman Mao's books and hand them over to the workers, peasants, and soldiers!

At the conference convened by the Ministry of Culture, many representatives from the publishing, printing, and distribution departments angrily exposed the crimes of a small handful of capitalist representatives who had infiltrated the Party, controlled the power of the propaganda and publishing departments, and crazily suppressed the publication and distribution of the works of Chairman Mao. They said that in recent years, there has been a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie on two roads in the issue of publishing the works of Chairman Mao. These black gang leaders, who are more venomous than snakes, extremely hate Mao Zedong Thought, especially fear that the workers, peasants, and soldiers will master Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, they have set up countless obstacles for the publication, printing, and distribution of the works of Chairman Mao. Publishing other books, including those messy black and bad books, can be given the green light and go smoothly; only publishing the works of Chairman Mao must be approved by these "authority" lords. They only allowed a few printing plants, a few machines, and a few workers nationwide to print the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," and stipulated many cumbersome regulations that exceed objective actual conditions. The representatives exposed that these ghosts and snakes had used "paper supply is tight" as an excuse to greatly reduce the number of copies of the works of Chairman Mao published and distributed. In 1962, only more than 50,000 copies of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" were published throughout the year, while "Dream of the Red Chamber" was published in 140,000 copies; in the same year, 72 tons of paper were used to print the works of Chairman Mao, while printing those books of emperors, generals, talents, beauties, ghosts, and snakes, foreign books, ancient books, and bad books used 7,500 tons of paper. In those years, anti-party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought black books, books that spread the poison of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, were rampant everywhere, poisoning the masses. These books were given special treatment, reprinted, carefully made, and elaborately decorated. The anti-party black gang used these and other vicious means to turn the publishing and distribution industry into a tool for them to subvert proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism.

Many revolutionary workers from the publishing, printing, and distribution departments in Beijing and other places were very excited when they heard that their units would undertake the work of publishing and distributing the works of Chairman Mao. They spread the news, congratulated each other, and the atmosphere was joyous and lively everywhere. In one day, determination letters and guarantee letters were pasted all over the walls. The workers in the printing plants wrote in the determination letters and guarantee letters: Now it's great, every worker, every machine, every factory can contribute to printing the works of Chairman Mao. This is the great trust of the Party and Chairman Mao to us, we feel infinitely proud, infinitely honored, infinitely excited, and infinitely happy! Printing the books of Chairman Mao is producing the most powerful spiritual atomic bomb, we are willing to print the books of Chairman Mao for life. The revolutionary workers from the publishing, printing, and distribution departments unanimously believe that promoting Mao Zedong Thought is the most fundamental task of cultural publishing work and our most sacred duty. The more the enemy opposes our publishing the works of Chairman Mao, the more we must publish them in large quantities and at high speeds, "one year equals sixteen years"! We must, with the greatest enthusiasm, the highest standards, the best quality, and the fastest speed, print the books of Chairman Mao and send them to the hands of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, arm our class brothers, and promote the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In this great era when the workers, peasants, and soldiers study and master Mao Zedong Thought, we must turn the great Mao Zedong Thought into an incredibly powerful material force, ensure that our revolutionary cause remains evergreen for thousands of years, and ensure that our country remains prosperous for thousands of years!

    适应广大人民群众学习毛泽东思想的迫切需要
    中共中央决定大量出版毛主席著作
    文化部召开会议制订计划，今明两年印行《毛泽东选集》三千五百万部，《选读》本和单行本由各省（区）市自行负责印刷。来自各地的代表反映了全国人民无比尊敬和爱戴伟大领袖毛主席，无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜毛泽东思想，日夜盼望买到毛主席著作的万分迫切心情。中共中央的决定是我国政治生活中一个具有重大历史意义的事件，是当前文化大革命的又一胜利。
    新华社七日讯　为了满足广大人民群众学习毛泽东思想的迫切需要，中共中央决定加速大量出版毛主席著作，号召全国出版、印刷、发行部门的广大干部和职工立即动员起来，全力以赴，把出版和发行毛主席著作作为压倒一切的任务。通过今明两年的加速大量印制，广大群众梦寐以求的毛主席著作将逐步在全国敞开供应。
    最近文化部根据中共中央的指示，召开了全国毛主席著作印制发行工作会议，制定了大量印制毛主席著作的具体计划和发行计划。《毛泽东选集》今明两年印行三千五百万部，《毛泽东著作选读》甲种本、乙种本和毛主席著作单行本，一般都由各省、市、自治区自行负责印制，在今明两年内逐步做到充分满足广大群众的需要。
    中共中央决定加速大量出版和发行毛主席著作，是我国政治生活中一个具有重大历史意义的事件，是全国人民的大喜事，是当前无产阶级文化大革命运动的又一胜利。
    新华社七日讯　文化部根据中共中央的指示，最近在北京召开了全国毛主席著作印制发行工作会议。会议要求全国出版、印刷和发行部门立即采取革命措施，千方百计加速大量印制毛主席著作，使毛主席著作能在全国范围内逐步做到敞开供应，满足广大工农兵和革命干部、革命知识分子学习毛主席著作的迫切需要。
    最近几年，广大工农兵群众、革命干部和革命知识分子活学活用毛主席著作的运动在全国展开以来，毛主席著作的供求矛盾非常突出。而由于反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的黑帮把持了许多宣传出版部门的大权，制造种种借口限制毛主席著作的印行数量，因而更加加重了毛主席著作供应不足的状况。这种状况，引起了广大人民群众的强烈不满。为了从根本上改变毛主席著作出版发行工作严重落后于形势、落后于群众需要的状况，会议要求各地出版、印刷和发行部门坚决依靠各级党委的领导，充分发动群众，调动全体职工的革命积极性，本着自力更生的精神，战胜一切困难，让一切有条件可以承印毛主席著作的印刷厂都来承办印制毛主席著作的光荣政治任务，采取集中力量打歼灭战的办法，千方百计扩大毛主席著作的印行数量。
    会议期间，中共中央宣传部副部长张平化讲了话。
    来自各地的出版、印刷、发行单位和有关部门的代表，反映了当地党委对这次会议给予的高度重视和广大职工的坚定决心。代表们都以无比高昂的革命热情，坚决、主动请求会议多给他们分配任务。许多第一次得到承印毛主席著作光荣权利的单位，更是干劲十足。这些单位的代表激动而又豪迈地说：“印制毛主席著作，是革命的需要，是时代赋予我们最光荣、最迫切、最重要的任务。即使有天大的困难，我们也不怕，我们一定保证完成任务！”
    到会代表列举了大量激动人心的事例，反映了全国广大人民群众无比尊敬和爱戴伟大领袖毛主席，无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜毛泽东思想，日夜盼望买到毛主席著作的万分迫切的心情。他们在千万封来信中说，学习毛主席著作是全中国革命人民的第一需要。毛主席的书是最好的书，最革命的书，最科学的书。毛主席的书字字是真金，句句是真理。毛泽东思想是全中国人民和全世界革命人民心中的红太阳，是我们的命根子，是我们的传家宝。鱼儿离水不能活，我们离开了毛泽东思想怎能干革命！千种书，万种书，我们最爱读毛主席的书！我们要做无产阶级革命派，要永远跟着中国共产党，要在一切工作中高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，就非读毛主席的书不可！
    代表们在讨论会上，朗读了他们带来的一部分群众来信。这些来信反映出我国千千万万革命群众如饥似渴、到处奔走购买毛主席著作的动人情景。许多工人、农民、解放军战士、革命干部和学生，四出奔走，不放过一切机会，一心要买到毛主席的书。很多没有书的人，夜以继日、通宵达旦地抄录毛主席的一篇篇文章、一段段语录。辽宁省营口市学习毛主席著作积极分子、电子仪器厂工人吕金斗，从一九六○年以来，用和《毛泽东选集》同样大小的纸张，工工整整、逐字逐句地把《毛泽东选集》一至三卷全部抄录了下来。一些群众难以描绘自己刻不容缓、万分需要毛主席著作的焦急心情，只好在信中写上“盼！盼！盼！！！”“快！快！快！！！”几个大字。还有许多工农兵群众直接写信给党中央、毛主席提出请求：立即责成出版发行部门把毛主席的书大量印出来，交到工农兵群众手里！
    在文化部召开的这次会议上，许多出版、印刷和发行部门的代表愤怒地控诉了一小撮混进党内的资产阶级代表人物，把持宣传出版部门的大权，疯狂地压制毛主席著作出版发行的滔天罪行。他们说，这些年来，在出版毛主席著作的问题上，一直存在着无产阶级和资产阶级之间两条道路的斗争。这些心比蛇蝎还毒的反党黑帮头子，极端仇视毛泽东思想，特别害怕工农兵群众掌握毛泽东思想，因此，他们为毛主席著作的出版、印刷和发行工作设置了数不清的障碍。出版别的书，包括那些乱七八糟的黑书、坏书，可以开放绿灯，畅行无阻；唯独出版毛主席的著作，却一定要经过这班“权威”老爷的批准。他们只准全国少数几家印刷厂、少数几部机器、少数工人来印制《毛泽东选集》，并且规定了许多超过客观实际条件的烦琐条文。代表们揭发，这些牛鬼蛇神曾以“纸张供应紧张”为借口，大力削减毛主席著作的出版发行数量。一九六二年全年，《毛泽东选集》只出版了五万多部，而《红楼梦》却出版了十四万部；同年用于印毛主席著作的纸张七十二吨，而印那些帝王将相、才子佳人、牛鬼蛇神的洋书、古书、坏书却用去纸张七千五百多吨。那几年，反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的黑书，宣扬封建主义、资本主义、修正主义毒素的坏书，到处泛滥，毒害群众。这些书特别受到优厚待遇，一版再版，精心制作，装潢考究。反党黑帮们就是采用这种种恶劣的手段，把出版发行事业变成了他们颠覆无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义的工具。
    北京等地的许多出版、印刷和发行部门的广大革命职工，一听到自己单位要承办毛主席著作出版发行工作的时候，都非常激动。他们奔走相告，互相祝贺，到处喜气洋洋，一片欢腾景象。一天之内，决心书、保证书就贴满了墙头。印刷厂的工人们在决心书、保证书里说，这下子可好了，我们每个工人、每部机器、每座工厂都能为印制毛主席著作贡献出一份力量了。这是党和毛主席对我们的莫大信任，我们感到无限自豪，无尚光荣，无比兴奋，无比幸福！印毛主席的书就是生产威力最最强大的精神原子弹，我们愿意一辈子印毛主席的书。出版、印刷和发行部门的广大革命职工一致认为，宣传毛泽东思想是文化出版工作的最根本的任务，是我们最崇高的天职。敌人越是反对我们出版毛主席著作，我们就越要大量地出版，高速度地出版，
  “一年等于十六年”地出版！我们一定要以最大的热情，最高的标准，最好的质量，最快的速度，把毛主席的书印制出来，送到工农兵手中，武装我们的阶级弟兄，推动无产阶级文化大革命的胜利前进。在这工农兵学习和掌握毛泽东思想的伟大时代，我们要让伟大的毛泽东思想变成无比巨大的物质力量，保证我们的革命事业千秋万代永葆青春，保证我们的国家千秋万代永远兴旺！
