Recently, the open exposure and criticism of the vanguard of anti-party and anti-socialist elements in the economic field, the former director of the Institute of Economics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Sun Yefang, is another great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Sun Yefang is a thoroughgoing revisionist. For many years, he has used the banner of "old economist" and "old Communist Party member" to spread a large number of poisonous arrows in various forums. In his articles, reports, and speeches, his language is poisonous, and his reactionary arrogance is as fierce as that of the most vicious class enemies at home and abroad.

While viciously attacking the Party Central Committee, the Party's Three Red Banners, the socialist system, and Mao Zedong Thought, he put forward a set of revisionist "economic programs." He attempted to use profit as the guiding principle and money as the guiding principle to oppose Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle and proletarian politics as the guiding principle. He attempted to change the socialist production relations and turn socialist enterprises into capitalist enterprises.

Therefore, our struggle against Sun Yefang is not just an academic debate, but a struggle between Mao Zedong Thought and revisionism, between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between the socialist road and the capitalist road, and between revolution and counterrevolution.

By claiming that the "contradiction between people and things" is the "deepest intrinsic contradiction in the socialist economy," he is essentially opposing Chairman Mao's theory on class and class struggle.

Sun Yefang fiercely opposes the proletarian political line and viciously distorts and attacks Chairman Mao's theory on the contradictions, classes, and class struggle in socialist society.

Chairman Mao's great development of Marxism-Leninism is to comprehensively and profoundly expound that in the entire socialist period, there exists a class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, a struggle between the socialist road and the capitalist road, and a struggle between antagonistic contradictions and contradictions among the people. Chairman Mao's theory on the contradictions, classes, and class struggle in socialist society is the red line running through the entire socialist revolution and socialist construction. We must also adhere to this red line in our study of political economy. However, Sun Yefang attempts to remove this red line and replace it with his own so-called "red line." He says: "The deepest intrinsic contradiction in the socialist economy" is the "contradiction between people and things," that is, the contradiction between "labor" and "products," the contradiction between "value" and "use value." The study of socialist political economy should take "achieving the greatest useful effect with the least labor consumption" as the "red line." Here, class struggle is castrated, and the contradictions between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between the socialist road and the capitalist road, are invisible. This is a thoroughgoing bourgeois black line.

As early as 1859, Engels pointed out: "Economics does not study things, but people and their relationships, ultimately the relationships between classes and classes." Undoubtedly, in socialist society, there exist classes and class struggle, and there is a struggle between the two roads. Therefore, the subject of study in socialist political economy is also the relationships between people and people, between classes and classes.

In socialist society, it is necessary to constantly resolve the contradictions between production relations and productive forces and to persist in continuous revolution. Chairman Mao said: In our country, "socialist production relations have been established, which are in line with the development of productive forces; but they are still very imperfect, and these imperfect aspects are in contradiction with the development of productive forces." In the sixteen years since the founding of the nation, we have successfully completed the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, and on the basis of agricultural cooperation, we have realized the people's commune. In the future, we will continue to adjust the production relations in cities and rural areas. We do this precisely to resolve the contradictions between production relations and productive forces and to promote the rapid development of productive forces. The so-called "old economist" Sun Yefang curses the Party for "talking about production relations for these years, making production relations a mystical thing," "talking about continuous revolution without substance." These words expose Sun Yefang, this representative of the bourgeoisie, as extremely terrified of our resolute pursuit of the socialist revolution to the end. He opposes Chairman Mao's teachings, opposes the study of these actual existing contradictions in production relations, and attempts to drag the established socialist production relations back to the old capitalist road.

Chairman Mao also said: "In addition to the situation where production relations and the development of productive forces are both in line and in contradiction, there is also the situation where the superstructure and the economic base are both in line and in contradiction." To make the superstructure in line with the socialist economic base and better serve the economic base, it is necessary to persist in class struggle in the political and ideological fields and reform all superstructures that do not conform to the economic base. It is necessary to make political and ideological work the lifeline of all economic work. All economic work and economic research work must highlight proletarian politics, pay great attention to people's spiritual outlook, and pay attention to the reaction of the superstructure on the economic base.

Since the founding of the nation, we have carried out continuous revolutions on the political and ideological fronts. Starting from the socialist education movement in 1963 to this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our socialist revolution has entered a more profound and broader new stage. Through this series of revolutions, the spiritual outlook of the Chinese people has undergone tremendous changes. The whole country has studied Chairman Mao's works, and on all fronts, tens of thousands of advanced figures like Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Mai Xiande, Liu Yingjun, Jiao Yulu, Wang Jinxi, Chen Yonggui, who do not seek fame or profit, do not fear hardship or death, and serve the people wholeheartedly, have emerged. A new upsurge in the national economy has appeared, and our cities and rural areas are full of prosperity.

Practice has proven that the more thorough the revolution in the political and ideological fields, the more revolutionary the people's thoughts, the more fully the people's enthusiasm and creativity can be unleashed, and the faster and smoother the socialist construction will proceed. Sun Yefang says that our "general shortcoming is to put politics and ideology in the first place." On the contrary, putting political and ideological work in the first place is our greatest advantage. Because we fully value the spiritual revolution of the people, we arm the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals with Mao Zedong Thought, our socialist revolution and socialist construction have achieved great success. This is completely in line with the dialectical materialist epistemology proposed by Chairman Mao, "material transforms into spirit, and spirit transforms into material." Sun Yefang's slander of political leadership as a "subjective idealist viewpoint" is in vain.

Sun Yefang says, "emphasizing the role of thought leads to the opposite," "destroying productive forces." The fact is, we continuously carry out revolutions in the political and ideological fields, continuously eliminate old ideas, old cultures, old customs, and old habits, and greatly liberate productive forces, develop production, and firmly advance along the socialist path. This situation cannot but make Sun Yefang and a small handful of counterrevolutionaries who attempt to restore capitalism feel like sitting on pins and needles, unable to rest.

Sun Yefang opposes proletarian political leadership and advocates bourgeois political leadership. He emphasizes that "political leadership should be included in the concept of economic effect," which means, in essence, to include it in the concept of profit. Whoever makes the most profit is the most "advanced," the most "politically led." This is a pure bourgeois political leadership.

In the entire historical period of building socialism and communism in our country, it is necessary to constantly arm people's minds with Mao Zedong Thought, raise the people's communist consciousness, constantly develop productive forces, and gradually eliminate the differences between workers and peasants, between urban and rural areas, and between mental and physical labor. Sun Yefang says: In the transition to communism, "eliminating the three differences is not the main thing," "communist consciousness is not the main thing." It is obvious that the communism he wants is the "potato roast beef communism" of Khrushchev, which is actually capitalism.

The vast majority of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals in our country all regard Chairman Mao's books as their guiding principles. Sun Yefang is completely the opposite. He is keen on using the works of Soviet revisionists and economists hired by the monopoly bourgeoisie as his guiding principles. The so-called "red line" he proposes, "achieving the greatest useful effect with the least labor consumption," is copied from the works of bourgeois political economy. For example:

The hired economist of American monopolists, Henderson and Chaudhuri, wrote: Economics should study "achieving the maximum possible output with a certain amount of cost expenditure," "achieving the maximum profit."

The Swedish economist, Wicksell, known as the Marshall of the European continent, wrote: Political economy should study "activities to achieve the maximum results with the minimum possible resources."

Look, Sun Yefang uses such a bourgeois black line to oppose Chairman Mao's theory on the contradictions, classes, and class struggle in socialist society, and to oppose proletarian political leadership. Isn't his role as a bourgeois agent now completely exposed?

Sun Yefang is a "value law first" advocate. He believes that the value law is the main and basic economic law in socialist society. He says: "Among objective economic laws, the value law is the most important." "Emphasizing objective economic laws, first of all, emphasize the value law." Although the value law is "not the only one, but the basic one," "many other laws are derived from it." "Thousands of laws, ten thousand laws, the value law is the first." Therefore, he advocates "placing the plan on the basis of the value law."

Here, Sun Yefang equates the role of the value law in socialist society with that in capitalist society. He kicks out the leadership of the proletarian state over the national economy and bows down to the value law. He does this intentionally to oppose Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The contradiction between social production and social needs that will objectively exist for a long time needs people to constantly adjust it through state plans." Sun Yefang uses the fallacy of adjusting the national economy with the value law to oppose this instruction of Chairman Mao.

The value law is the economic law of commodity production. In socialist society, commodity production and commodity exchange still exist, and the value law will still play a role. However, socialist commodity production is fundamentally different from capitalist commodity production. In socialist society, the value law cannot play a role spontaneously, as it does in capitalist society, but is consciously used by the Party and the state to serve the socialist revolution and socialist construction. In socialist society, due to the public ownership of the means of production, all important products are controlled by the state and supplied by the state in a planned manner, and there is no free market competition. The role of the value law has been strictly limited. This is a fact. If we follow Sun Yefang's advocacy, we can only lead the socialist economy to the capitalist track.

Sun Yefang highly praises capitalists for valuing the value law and viciously attacks us for "ignoring the value law." He says: "Capitalists can well use this law in practice"; "we believe in Marx's labor value theory, but we want to expel this theory along with the free market from the socialist realm." Here, he tears off all disguises and openly reveals his traitor's face. When we formulate plans and set prices, we do not ignore the value law but fully consider the role of the value law. Sun Yefang gnashes his teeth and curses us, bows and scrapes to the capitalists. The reason is simple: because we have overthrown the capitalist system and limited the role of the value law, we have not, like capitalist society, allowed the value law to become the spontaneous regulator of production.

After his fallacies were criticized, Sun Yefang, in order to defend himself, invented two "value laws." He says that one is the "law of price and value consistency," which is the socialist value law; the other is the "law of price and value inconsistency," which is the capitalist value law. He says he advocates the former, not the latter. Look, this so-called "old economist" Sun Yefang is ignorant of economic knowledge to such an extent! Everyone knows that whether in capitalist society or in socialist society, prices and values have always been both consistent and inconsistent; price consistency with value is temporary and relative, price inconsistency with value is constant and absolute. The difference is that in capitalist society, commodity prices are formed spontaneously and blindly under the control of the value law; while in socialist society, commodity prices are set by the state in a planned and conscious manner based on value, politics, and economic needs.

Commodities, value, and the value law, although they have continued through several stages of social development, are ultimately products of certain historical conditions and are not "evergreen." In the communist period, they will all withdraw from the historical stage. Sun Yefang absurdly says that value, the value law, and these things not only exist in the socialist period but will also exist in the communist period and will continue to play a dominant role in the production field. He determines that the "concept of value" is indispensable in any period, and without it, it "cannot be an economy"; "whether in the highest stage or the primary stage of communist society, this law (the value law) will always exist and function." He intentionally blurs the distinction between capitalism and socialism and communism, and what is the difference between this and the reactionary bourgeois economists advocating the eternal existence of capitalism?

Sun Yefang also wants to use the value law to revise the Party's general line for socialist construction, saying that the "value law is actually another expression of the general line," "the general line's more, faster, better, and cheaper is to create the greatest use value with the least cost." This is nonsense. Everyone knows that the fundamental significance of the Party's general line for socialist construction is to fully utilize the great potential for developing productive forces provided by the socialist system, to mobilize all positive factors, to unite all possible forces, to implement a policy of "two legs walking," to develop our national economy at high speed and in a planned and proportionate manner, and to enable our country to rapidly build into a socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, modern national defense, and modern science and technology. How can this be "another expression of the value law"? Sun Yefang's "creating the greatest use value with the least cost" cannot be compared with the general line's more, faster, better, and cheaper. Sun Yefang's value law theory is incompatible with our socialist system. He uses the value law to revise the Party's general line, aiming to make our national economy completely controlled by the value law and to turn the socialist economy into a capitalist economy.

Sun Yefang has been advocating the value law in recent years to provide a theoretical basis for his revisionist proposals of profit leadership and enterprise autonomy.

Sun Yefang advocates "placing the national economic plan on the basis of the value law," which is essentially to abandon planning and to make us, like in capitalist society, completely regulate social production by the value law. To put it more clearly, it is to make us, like capitalists, decide the direction of production development and the direction of construction investment based on the size of profits.

He hates that we do not accept his revisionist proposals and slanders us as fearing profit "as some ghost believers fear ghosts." He shouts: "Do not spread the ghostly neurosis of fearing ghosts again." He also viciously says: "For capitalists, producing without considering financial costs is unimaginable. But in our country, 'not sparing any effort' seems to be the necessary spirit of socialist construction," "we, in order to draw a clear line with the capital of capitalists... have also negated the investment effect along with the capital." In Sun Yefang's view, it seems that we are so afraid of profit that we do not talk about economic effects at all, as if we are squandering the family property. This is slander!

We are firmly opposed to profit leadership, but we emphasize increasing production and saving, advocating that all economic departments and units should strive to provide accumulation for the state and complete the state's profit remittance tasks. In fact, more than 90% of our annual financial revenue comes from the accumulation of state-owned enterprises (including profits and taxes). If our state-owned enterprises do not strive to provide accumulation for the state, then where does our annual increase in financial revenue come from? Where does the expanding basic construction fund come from? Our country has become a country without foreign debt. Moreover, in recent years, we have not issued public bonds, and the previously issued public bonds will be fully repaid in two more years. Facts speak louder than words. Sun Yefang wants to use slander and defamation to blacken our faces, which is absolutely impossible.

Since our state-owned enterprises have provided so much accumulation for the state, why does Sun Yefang still say that we fear profit like fearing ghosts? The reason is simple: because we oppose profit leadership and do not approve of Sun Yefang's advocacy of pursuing profit like capitalists. We advocate proletarian political leadership and have repeatedly criticized some enterprises for not highlighting politics, not first considering the needs of the state and the people, and the capitalist business ideas and style of "big profit, big effort; small profit, small effort; no profit, no effort." This, of course, cannot but make Sun Yefang furious.

Sun Yefang openly proposes to "restore the reputation of profit," to "take profit as the central link of enterprise management," and to take the average rate of return on capital as the sole criterion for measuring the "superiority and inferiority" of enterprises. He advocates that the higher the rate of return on capital of a product, the more of that product should be produced. Enterprises with high profits should be developed, and enterprises with low profits should be eliminated. He also believes that when the state chooses the direction of investment, it should also take profit as the standard, investing in the sector with the highest rate of return on capital. He often uses the relationship between the "nose ring" and the "ox" to illustrate the relationship between profit and the entire national economy. He mocks us for setting so many planned indicators, saying that it is a "lifting the ox's legs" method. In short, he advocates that only one profit indicator is enough, and by holding the profit "nose ring," everything can be "driven."

The industrial and agricultural production of a socialist state is not for profit but to meet the needs of the state and the people. "Develop the economy and ensure supply" is the general policy of economic work and financial work stipulated by Chairman Mao. The fundamental characteristic of the socialist economic system is that, on the basis of public ownership of the means of production, the proletarian state organizes production according to the needs of the whole society in a planned manner. The state, in order to ensure the balance of production and demand for various products and to ensure the planned and proportionate development of various departments of the national economy, must implement strict planned management of the national economy. It is required to formulate production plans for various important products, plans for varieties and quality, and plans for the trial production of new products; it is required that various departments and enterprises have output value plans; in order to check the economic effect of enterprises, it is also necessary to have plans for labor productivity, cost, and profit. Profit is only one of several planned indicators. Sun Yefang advocates taking profit as the sole indicator and as the "nose ring," which is actually to lead the socialist economy to the capitalist road.

Since Sun Yefang advocates profit leadership, he naturally advocates enterprise autonomy and opposes the state's planned management of enterprises. Therefore, he viciously attacks our planned system, saying that "using a unified and centralized planning agency to replace the chief leadership of the entire economic activity of the primitive tribal economy," treating the socialist economy "as a material economy like the original communist society," "only interested in the quantity of things and not caring about the labor cost," "ignoring the value law." In his view, there is only one way out, to implement enterprise autonomy and cancel the unified leadership and management of the proletarian state over the national economy. The so-called "big power" and "small power" he proposes is for the purpose of achieving this. He says: "I think the boundary between 'big power' and 'small power,' 'dead' and 'alive' in the financial and economic system is the boundary between expanded reproduction and simple reproduction. Matters within the scope of expanded reproduction are the big power of the state, and the state must strictly manage them, otherwise it will be chaotic; matters within the scope of simple reproduction are the small power that enterprises should manage themselves, and the state's excessive interference will kill them." The "big power" he talks about is the two things of distributing basic construction investment and collecting profits, which are managed by the state; as for the production, material allocation, and equipment renewal of enterprises, these are "small power," which should be managed by the enterprises themselves, and the state should not interfere. He once proudly said: "I advocate not even having product output indicators, more thorough than Belyaev." Think about it, what will be the result of doing this? The result will inevitably be to cancel the leadership of the Party and the proletarian state over the socialist economy, to cancel the socialist planned system, to let each enterprise compete freely for profit, and to make production chaotic.

According to the so-called "big power" and "small power" boundary proposed by Sun Yefang, it seems that he still approves of the state's unified allocation of basic construction investment. In fact, this is also a deception. Because Sun Yefang does not approve of our allocation of investment according to the needs of the state and the people, but advocates the allocation of investment according to the rate of return on capital of various industries, so that the law of average profit rate in capitalist society can also fully play a role here. In fact, this is not the state's unified allocation of investment, but the blind transfer of capital in capitalist society. If we follow his advocacy, what is the difference between socialist society and capitalist society?

In the past ten years, Sun Yefang, this counterrevolutionary who harbors deep hatred for the Party and socialism, has viciously attacked various aspects of the proletarian revolutionary cause. Whatever the Party advocates, he opposes; whatever the Party opposes, he advocates. Whenever there is an opportunity, he will make a big fuss. His articles, speeches, and so-called "research reports" are sometimes evasive, insidious, and obscure; sometimes they are bold and straightforward, and very exposed. No matter what methods he uses, they all adhere to the same principle. That is: advocating bourgeois political leadership, opposing proletarian political leadership; advocating profit leadership and material incentives, opposing the spiritual revolutionization of people and enterprises; advocating enterprise autonomy and economic liberalization, opposing the unified leadership and management of the proletarian state over the national economy. In a word, it is to oppose socialism and restore capitalism. This is his counterrevolutionary revisionist "economic program."

Sun Yefang's arrogance is not accidental and isolated, but a sharp reflection of the class struggle at home and abroad. Sun Yefang began to spread revisionist ideas in 1956. In this year, the CPSU held its 20th Congress, and a big black flag of revisionism was raised internationally. After Sun Yefang returned from his visit to the Soviet Union in this year, he continuously spread several big poisonous weeds. In 1959, after the 21st Congress of the CPSU, he visited the Soviet Union again and more fiercely opposed Stalin and praised Khrushchev. From 1959 to 1962, due to the sabotage of Soviet revisionists and three consecutive years of serious natural disasters, our country suffered temporary economic difficulties. Imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries launched an anti-China chorus, and the ghosts and snakes at home also came out in droves; at this time, Sun Yefang's anti-Party and anti-socialist criminal activities were also the most rampant. He is the trumpeter of Khrushchev's modern revisionism in China.

Thoroughly refuting Sun Yefang's counterrevolutionary revisionist "economic program," sweeping away all the ghosts and snakes in the field of economics and economic departments, and firmly grasping the important position of political economy in the hands of the proletariat, is an important combat mission for us in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the field of economics and economic departments to the end.

    驳孙冶方的修正主义“经济纲领”
    贡文声
    最近，对经济学界反党反社会主义的急先锋——中国科学院经济研究所前所长孙冶方进行公开的揭露和批判，这是无产阶级文化大革命的又一个大胜利。
      孙冶方是个彻头彻尾的修正主义分子。多年以来，他打着“老经济学家”、“老共产党员”的招牌，利用各种场合，放出了大量的毒箭。在他的文章、报告和讲演中，用语之毒，反动气焰之盛，同国内外最凶恶的阶级敌人毫无二致。
    他在恶毒地攻击党中央、攻击党的三面红旗、攻击社会主义制度、攻击毛泽东思想的同时，提出了一套修正主义“经济纲领”。他企图用利润挂帅、钞票挂帅来反对毛泽东思想挂帅、无产阶级政治挂帅。他妄图改变社会主义的生产关系，把社会主义企业变成资本主义企业。
    因此，我们同孙冶方的斗争，决不是什么学术争论，而是毛泽东思想同修正主义、无产阶级同资产阶级、社会主义道路同资本主义道路的斗争，是革命同反革命的斗争。
      把“人与物的矛盾”说成是“社会主义经济的最深远的内在矛盾”，实质上就是反对毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的学说
    孙冶方疯狂地反对无产阶级政治挂帅，恶毒地歪曲和攻击毛主席关于社会主义社会的矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争的学说。
    毛主席对于马克思列宁主义一个极其重大的发展，就是最全面、最深刻地阐明了在整个社会主义时期，都存在着无产阶级同资产阶级的阶级斗争，存在着社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，存在着敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾。毛主席关于社会主义社会的矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争的学说，是贯串整个社会主义革命和社会主义建设中的红线。我们研究政治经济学，也必须贯串这条红线。而孙冶方却力图抽去这条红线，换上他自己的所谓“红线”。他说：“社会主义经济的最深远的内在矛盾”，就是“人与物的矛盾”，即“劳动”同“产品”的矛盾，“价值同使用价值的矛盾”。研究社会主义政治经济学，要以“最少劳动消耗取得最大有用效果”为“红线”。在这里，阶级斗争被阉割了，无产阶级同资产阶级、社会主义道路同资本主义道路的矛盾看不见了。这是一条地地道道的资产阶级黑线。
    恩格斯早在一八五九年，就已经明确地指出：“经济学所研究的不是物，而是人和人之间的关系，归根到底是阶级和阶级之间的关系”。社会主义社会存在着阶级和阶级斗争，存在着两条道路的斗争，无疑地，社会主义政治经济学所要研究的，同样也是人同人之间、阶级同阶级之间的关系。
    社会主义社会，必须不断解决生产关系同生产力的矛盾，必须坚持不断革命。毛主席说：在我国，“社会主义生产关系已经建立起来，它是和生产力的发展相适应的；但是，它又还很不完善，这些不完善的方面和生产力的发展又是相矛盾的。”建国以后十六年来，我们已经胜利地完成了农业、手工业、资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，并在农业合作化的基础上实现了人民公社化，今后仍然要对城乡的生产关系不断地进行调整。我们这样做，正是为了解决生产关系同生产力的矛盾，促进生产力的迅速发展。号称“老经济学家”的孙冶方，咒骂党“这几年空谈生产关系，把生产关系变成玄虚的东西”，“空谈不断革命，不扎实”。这些话暴露了孙冶方这个资产阶级代表人物，对于我们坚决把社会主义革命进行到底的极端恐惧。他反对毛主席的教导，反对研究生产关系中这些实际存在的矛盾，企图把已经建立起来的社会主义生产关系，重新拉回到资本主义的老路上去。
    毛主席又说：“除了生产关系和生产力发展的这种又相适应又相矛盾的情况以外，还有上层建筑和经济基础的又相适应又相矛盾的情况。”为了使上层建筑同社会主义经济基础相适应，并且更好地为经济基础服务，必须坚持政治思想文化领域里的阶级斗争，改革一切不适应经济基础的上层建筑。必须把政治思想工作作为一切经济工作的生命线。一切经济工作和经济研究工作，都必须突出无产阶级政治，十分重视人们的精神面貌，重视上层建筑对经济基础的反作用。
    建国以来，我国在政治、思想战线上，进行了不断的革命。从一九六三年开始的社会主义教育运动，一直到这次无产阶级文化大革命，使我国社会主义革命又进入了一个更加深入、更加广阔的新阶段。通过这一系列的革命，我国人民的精神面貌发生了巨大的变化。全国人民大学毛主席著作，各条战线上出现了千千万万个象雷锋、王杰、麦贤得、刘英俊、焦裕禄、王进喜、陈永贵等不为名、不为利、不怕苦、不怕死、全心全意为人民服务的先进人物，出现了国民经济的新高潮，我国城市和农村到处呈现欣欣向荣的景象。
    实践证明，政治思想上的革命进行得愈彻底，人民群众的思想就愈革命化，人民群众的积极性、创造性也就愈能充分发挥，社会主义建设也就进行得愈迅速，愈顺利。孙冶方说我们“过去的普遍缺点是把政治思想放在第一位”。恰恰相反，把政治思想工作放在第一位正是我们最大的优点。由于我们充分重视了人的思想革命化，用毛泽东思想武装广大工农兵群众、革命干部和革命知识分子的头脑，我们的社会主义革命和社会主义建设才取得了伟大的成就。这是完全符合毛主席提出的“物质变精神，精神变物质”的辩证唯物主义认识论的。孙冶方把政治挂帅污蔑为
  “唯心论观点”，那是徒劳的。
    孙冶方说，“强调思想的作用，就走到反面”，“破坏了生产力”。事实是，我们不断进行政治思想领域里的革命，不断破除旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，就大大解放了生产力，发展了生产，坚定地沿着社会主义方向前进。这种情况，不能不使孙冶方等一小撮妄图搞资本主义复辟的反革命分子如坐针毡，皇皇不可终日。
    孙冶方反对无产阶级政治挂帅，就是提倡资产阶级政治挂帅。他强调“政治挂帅应该包括在经济效果的概念中”，说穿了，就是要包括在利润的概念中，谁取得利润最多，谁就最“先进”，最“政治挂帅”。这是不折不扣的资产阶级政治挂帅。
    在我国建设社会主义和共产主义的整个历史时期，必须不断地用毛泽东思想武装人们的头脑，提高人民的共产主义觉悟，不断地发展生产力，逐步消灭工农差别、城乡差别、体力劳动同脑力劳动的差别。孙冶方说：过渡到共产主义，“消灭三个差别不是主要的”，“共产主义觉悟不是主要的”，很明显，他要的共产主义，就是赫鲁晓夫牌的“土豆烧牛肉的共产主义”，实际上就是资本主义。
    我国广大工农兵群众、革命干部和革命知识分子，都把毛主席的书当作指导方向。孙冶方完全相反，他热中于把苏联修正主义和垄断资产阶级御用学者的书，当作指导方向。他作为“红线”提出来的所谓
  “最少劳动消耗取得最大有用效果”，就是从资产阶级的政治经济学著作中抄来的。例如：
    美国垄断资本家御用学者亨德孙和邝德特写道：经济学要研究“用一定量的成本支出，力求获得尽可能最大的产量”，“获得最大的利润”。
    被称为欧洲大陆的马歇尔的瑞典经济学家威克塞尔写道：政治经济学要研究“用尽可能最少资财获得尽可能最大成果的活动”。
    大家看，孙冶方就是用这样一条资产阶级黑线来对抗毛主席关于社会主义社会的矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争的学说，反对无产阶级政治挂帅。他的资产阶级代理人的面貌，难道还不是昭然若揭吗？
      把价值规律抬高到至高无上的地位，就是要使社会主义经济蜕化为资本主义经济
    孙冶方是“价值规律第一”论者。他认为，价值规律是社会主义社会中主要的、基本的经济规律。他说：“客观经济规律中，以价值规律为主，最重要”。“强调客观经济规律，首先要强调价值规律”。价值规律虽然“不是唯一的，但是基本的”，“许多其它法则是从此派生出来的”。“千规律，万规律，价值规律第一条”。因此，他主张“把计划放在价值规律的基础上”。
    在这里，孙冶方把价值规律在社会主义社会中的作用，同在资本主义社会中的作用完全等同起来。他把无产阶级国家对国民经济的领导一脚踢开，拜倒在价值规律的脚下。他这样作，是有意同毛泽东思想相对抗的。毛主席教导我们：“在客观上将会长期存在的社会生产和社会需要之间的矛盾，就需要人们时常经过国家计划去调节。”孙冶方就是用价值规律调节国民经济的谬论，来反对毛主席的这个指示。
    价值规律是商品生产的经济规律。在社会主义社会里，还存在着商品生产和商品交换，价值规律仍然要起作用。但是，社会主义的商品生产根本不同于资本主义的商品生产。在社会主义社会，价值规律不能象在资本主义社会那样，自发地发生作用，而是由党和国家自觉地运用它来为社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务的。社会主义社会由于生产资料公有，一切重要产品都由国家掌握，由国家有计划地供应，不存在市场自由竞争，价值规律的作用已经受到严格的限制。这是客观事实。如果按照孙冶方的主张去办，就只能把社会主义经济引导到资本主义的轨道上去。
    孙冶方十分赞扬资本家重视价值规律，恶毒地攻击我们“忽视价值规律”。他说：“资本家在实践中能很好地运用这规律”；“我们是信奉马克思的劳动价值论的，但是想把这学说同自由市场一起从社会主义领域中除了籍。”在这里，他撕掉了一切遮羞布，赤裸裸地亮出了一副叛徒嘴脸。我们在编制计划和制订价格的时候，并没有忽视价值规律，而是充分地考虑了价值规律的作用。孙冶方咬牙切齿咒骂我们，卑躬屈膝地讨好资本家，原因很简单，就是因为我们推翻了资本主义制度，限制了价值规律的作用，没有象资本主义社会那样，让价值规律成为自发的生产调节者。
    孙冶方在他的谬论受到批判以后，为了给自己作辩解，就编造了两个“价值规律”。他说什么一个是
  “价格和价值相符合的规律”，这是社会主义的价值规律；一个是“价格和价值相背离的规律”，这是资本主义的价值规律。他说他鼓吹的是前者而不是后者。大家看，这个号称“老经济学家”的孙冶方，对经济学的常识竟无知到这样的程度！谁都知道，不论在资本主义社会，还是在社会主义社会，价格同价值从来就是又相符合、又相背离的；价格符合价值是暂时的、相对的，价格背离价值是经常的、绝对的。不同的是，在资本主义社会，商品价格受价值规律支配，是盲目地自发地形成的；而在社会主义社会，商品价格是由国家根据价值，根据政治和经济的需要，自觉地有计划地制定的。
    商品、价值、价值规律虽然延续了几个社会发展阶段，但是它们毕竟是一定历史条件下的产物，不是
  “万古长青”的，到共产主义时期，都是要退出历史舞台的。孙冶方胡说价值、价值规律这些东西，不但在社会主义时期存在，到了共产主义时期仍然要存在，仍然要在生产领域中起支配作用。他断定“价值这个概念”，不论在任何时期，“也是少不了的”，少了它，就“不成其为经济”；“不论在共产主义社会的最高阶段或是初级阶段，这个规律（价值规律）将始终存在着而且作用着”。他这样有意抹煞资本主义同社会主义、共产主义的区别，同反动的资产阶级经济学家鼓吹资本主义“万世长存”的梦呓，又有什么不同呢？
    孙冶方还妄想用价值规律来篡改党的社会主义建设总路线，说什么“价值规律实际上是总路线的另一提法”，“总路线的多快好省，就是以最少的费用，创造最大的使用价值”。这又是胡说八道。大家知道，党的社会主义建设总路线的根本意义，就是要充分利用社会主义制度所提供的发展生产力的巨大可能性，调动一切积极因素，团结一切可能团结的力量，实行一套“两条腿走路”的方针，有计划按比例地、高速度地发展我国国民经济，使我国能够比较迅速地建设成为具有现代工业、现代农业、现代国防和现代科学技术的社会主义强国。这怎么是“价值规律的另一提法”呢？孙冶方的“最少费用创造最大使用价值”，怎能同总路线中的多快好省相提并论呢？孙冶方的价值规律论同我们的社会主义制度是水火不相容的。他用价值规律篡改党的总路线，目的就是要使我国国民经济完全受价值规律所支配，让社会主义经济蜕化为资本主义经济。
    主张利润挂帅、企业自治，就是取消党和国家对社会主义国民经济的领导
    孙冶方在这几年大讲特讲价值规律，是为他的利润挂帅、企业自治等修正主义主张提供理论基础的。
    孙冶方主张“把国民经济计划放在价值规律的基础上”，实际上是不要计划，是要我们象在资本主义社会那样，完全由价值规律来调节社会生产。说得更加明白一点，就是要我们象资本家那样，根据利润的大小，来决定生产的发展方向，决定建设的投资方向。
    他恨我们不接受他那一套修正主义主张，就污蔑我们害怕利润“象有些信鬼的人怕鬼那样厉害”。他叫嚷说：“不要再散布恐鬼的神经衰弱症”。他并且恶毒地说：“对资本家来说，生产而不计财务成本，简直是不可想象的。但是在我们，‘不惜工本’似乎是社会主义建设的应有气魄”，“我们为了划清同资本家的资本的界限……把投资效果也跟资本一道给否定了”。在孙冶方看来，似乎我们这些人由于害怕利润，根本不讲经济效果，简直象败家子那样把家产败光。这是诽谤！
    我们是坚决反对利润挂帅的，但是，我们十分强调增产节约，主张各经济部门、经济单位都要努力为国家提供积累，完成国家规定的利润上缴任务。事实上，我们每年的财政收入，有百分之九十以上是国营企业所提供的积累（包括利润和税收）。如果我们的国营企业不为国家努力提供积累，那末我们年年增长的财政收入是从哪里来的呢？年年扩大的基本建设资金又是从哪里来的呢？我国已经成为世界上一个没有外债的国家。而且近年来也没有发行公债，以前发的公债，再过两年就可以全部还清。事实胜于雄辩，孙冶方想用造谣污蔑的办法来向我们脸上抹黑，这是万万做不到的。
    既然我们的国营企业为国家提供了这样多的积累，为什么孙冶方还要说我们象怕鬼那样害怕利润呢？道理很简单，就是因为我们反对利润挂帅，不赞成孙冶方所提倡的象资本家一样疯狂地追逐利润。我们提倡无产阶级政治挂帅，并不断批评了某些企业不突出政治，不首先考虑国家和人民的需要，“大利大干、小利小干、无利不干”的资本主义经营思想和作风。这当然就不能不使孙冶方大发雷霆。
    孙冶方公然提出“要为利润恢复名誉”，提出以利润“作为企业管理的中心环节”，以平均资金利润率作为衡量企业“优劣”的唯一尺度，他主张哪一种产品的资金利润率高，就多生产哪一种产品。利润高的企业就发展，利润低的企业就淘汰。他还认为，在国家选择投资方向的时候，也应当以利润为标准，哪一部门的资金利润率高，就向哪一部门投资。他经常用
  “牛鼻子”和“牛”的关系，来说明利润和整个国民经济的关系。他讥笑我们规定这样多的计划指标，是
  “抬牛腿”的笨办法。总之，他主张只要一个利润指标就够了，牵住了利润这个“牛鼻子”，就可以“带动一切”。
    社会主义国家的工农业生产，不是为着利润，而是为着满足国家和人民的需要。“发展经济，保障供给”，是毛主席规定的经济工作和财政工作的总方针。社会主义经济制度的根本特点，就是在生产资料公有制的基础上，由无产阶级国家根据整个社会的需要，有计划地组织生产。国家为着保证各类产品生产和需要的平衡，保证国民经济各部门有计划按比例地发展，必须对国民经济实行严格的计划管理。要求对各类重要产品订出产量计划，品种和质量计划，新产品的试制计划；要求各部门、各企业要有产值计划；为着检查企业的经济效果，还要有劳动生产率、成本和利润计划。利润只是若干种计划指标中的一种。孙冶方主张以利润作为唯一指标，作为“牛鼻子”，实际上他是要把社会主义经济引到资本主义的道路上去。
    孙冶方既然鼓吹利润挂帅，就当然要推行企业自治，反对国家对企业的计划管理。因此，他恶毒地攻击我们的计划制度，说什么“用一个统一集中的计划机关代替原始部落经济中的首脑领导着整个社会的经济活动”，把社会主义经济“看作是象原始共产主义社会一样的实物经济”，“只对物量感兴趣而不关心劳动花费”，“无视价值规律”。在他看来，出路只有一条，实行企业自治，取消无产阶级国家对国民经济的统一领导和管理。他提出的所谓“大权”同“小权”的界限，就是为着实现这个目的的。他说：“我认为财经体制中的‘大权’和‘小权’，‘死’和‘活’的界线，就是扩大再生产和简单再生产的界线。属于扩大再生产的范围以内的事是国家的大权，国家必须严格管理，不管或管而不严就会乱；属于简单再生产范围以内的事是企业应该自己管的小权，国家多加干涉就会管死”。他说的“大权”就是分配基本建设投资和收取利润这两件事，由国家管；至于企业的生产、物资调拨和设备更新等项活动，都是“小权”，都应当让企业自己去管，国家不能过问。他曾经洋洋得意地说：“我主张连产品产量指标都不要，比利别尔曼还彻底”。大家想想，这样做的结果将会怎么样呢？结果必然是取消党和无产阶级国家对社会主义经济的领导，取消社会主义的计划制度，让各个企业为追求利润而自由竞争，使生产处于无政府状态。
    按照孙冶方提出的所谓“大权”同“小权”的界限，似乎他还赞成基本建设投资由国家计划统一分配。其实，这也完全是一种欺骗。因为孙冶方并不赞成我们按照国家和人民的需要来分配投资，而主张按各行各业的资金利润率来分配投资，使资本主义社会的平均利润率规律在我们这里也能够充分发挥作用。实际上，这不是国家统一分配投资，而是资本主义的资金盲目转移。照他这种主张去作，社会主义社会同资本主义社会还有什么区别？
    近十年来，孙冶方这个对党对社会主义怀着刻骨仇恨的反革命分子，对无产阶级革命事业的各个方面进行了恶毒的攻击。党提倡什么他就反对什么，党反对什么他就拚命地提倡什么。只要一有机会，他就要大做反面文章。他的文章、讲演和所谓“研究报告”，有时躲躲闪闪，阴阳怪气，晦涩难懂；有时明目张胆，赤膊上阵，十分露骨。不管他采用什么样的手法，都万变不离其宗。这就是：鼓吹资产阶级政治挂帅，反对无产阶级政治挂帅；鼓吹利润挂帅和物质刺激，反对人的思想革命化和企业革命化；鼓吹企业自治和经济自由化，反对无产阶级国家对国民经济的统一领导和管理。一句话，就是反对社会主义，恢复资本主义。这就是他的反革命的修正主义“经济纲领。”
    孙冶方这样猖狂，决不是偶然的和孤立的现象，这是国内外阶级斗争的尖锐反映。孙冶方大肆宣传修正主义思想，开始于一九五六年。这一年，苏共召开了第二十次代表大会，在国际上树起了一面修正主义大黑旗。孙冶方在这一年访苏回来以后，就连续放出了几株大毒草。一九五九年，苏共二十一大以后，他再次访苏回来，更是大反斯大林，大捧赫鲁晓夫。从一九五九年到一九六二年这个期间，由于苏联修正主义者的破坏和连续三年的严重自然灾害，我国遭受了暂时经济困难，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，掀起了反华大合唱，国内的牛鬼蛇神也纷纷出笼；正在这个时候，孙冶方反党反社会主义的罪恶活动，也就最嚣张。他是赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义在中国的吹鼓手。
    彻底驳斥孙冶方的反革命的修正主义“经济纲领”，横扫经济学界和经济部门的一切牛鬼蛇神，把政治经济学这个重要的阵地牢牢地掌握在无产阶级手里，这是我们在无产阶级文化大革命中一项重大的战斗任务。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把经济学界和经济部门的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
