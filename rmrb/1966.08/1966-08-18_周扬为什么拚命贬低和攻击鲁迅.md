Editor's Note: For thirty years, Zhou Yang has used every opportunity and employed various means to "lay siege" and play the hooligan, desperately denigrating and attacking Lu Xun, playing the shameful role of a historical revisionist.

This is an important part of Zhou Yang's long-term anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought activities.

Chairman Mao, in his brilliant works such as "On New Democracy" and "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," gave a correct, comprehensive, and high evaluation of Lu Xun; he also made a serious and profound criticism of Zhou Yang and the bourgeois literary line he represented in the 1930s. Zhou Yang has long harbored resentment against Chairman Mao's criticism. His deliberate distortion of the history of the literary movement in the 1930s, and his denigration of Lu Xun's correct direction and great fighting role, are aimed at overturning Chairman Mao's correct conclusions about the history of the literary movement in the 1930s and his correct evaluation of Lu Xun. This is to establish his own position as the "patriarch" of the 1930s, continue to occupy the "throne" of literary leadership, and bring the entire literary world onto the track of modern revisionism, turning it into a tool for the restoration of capitalism.

Thirty years ago, in a letter, Lu Xun pointed out the evil deeds of Zhou Yang and his gang, saying, "They will eventually reveal their true colors in front of everyone." Lu Xun's words were right on the mark. Zhou Yang, after mixing in the revolutionary ranks for thirty years, has done many evil deeds. Under the mirror of Mao Zedong Thought and in the fiery Cultural Revolution, he has finally "revealed his true colors." We must thoroughly smash Zhou Yang's counter-revolutionary plots and thoroughly eliminate the poison of the Zhou Yang literary black line!

### 周扬为什么拚命贬低和攻击鲁迅

　　周扬为什么拚命贬低和攻击鲁迅
    编者按：三十年来，周扬利用一切机会，使出各种手段，“大布围剿阵”，大耍流氓术，拚命贬低和攻击鲁迅，扮演了一个篡改历史的可耻角色。
    这是周扬长期以来进行的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想活动中的一个重要组成部分。
    毛主席在《新民主主义论》、《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》等光辉著作中，对鲁迅作了正确的、全面的、高度的评价；对周扬和他所代表的三十年代资产阶级文艺路线，作了严肃、深刻的批判。周扬对于毛主席的批评一直怀恨在心。他所以处心积虑地篡改三十年代文艺运动的历史，贬低鲁迅的正确方向和伟大的战斗作用，正是要推翻毛主席对三十年代文艺运动历史的正确结论和对鲁迅的正确评价，以奠定自己三十年代“祖师爷”的地位，继续盘踞文艺领导的“宝座”，把整个文艺界纳入现代修正主义的轨道，变成资本主义复辟的工具。
    鲁迅在三十年前的一封信里，就针对周扬这伙人的恶劣行径说，“他们到底将在大家的眼前露出本相”。鲁迅的话说中了。周扬在革命队伍里混了三十年，作恶多端，在毛泽东思想的照妖镜下，在无产阶级文化大革命的烈火中，终于“露出本相”。我们一定要彻底粉碎周扬的反革命阴谋，彻底肃清周扬文艺黑线的流毒！
