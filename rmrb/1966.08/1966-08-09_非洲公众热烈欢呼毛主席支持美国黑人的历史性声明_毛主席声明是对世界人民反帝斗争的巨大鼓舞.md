In the three years since Chairman Mao Zedong called on the people of the world to unite and oppose American imperialism's racial discrimination and support the struggle of American blacks against racial discrimination, Tanzanian friends and African freedom fighters here have warmly welcomed the historic statement made by the great revolutionary leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong. They believe that this statement is "very beneficial guidance" not only for American blacks but also for the people of Asia and Africa, and for all oppressed people around the world in their struggles.

A Tanzanian politician said here to a Xinhua News Agency reporter, "Chairman Mao pointed out in the statement that the American ruling class has adopted a treacherous two-faced approach. On the one hand, it continues to condone and participate in the discrimination and persecution of blacks, even sending troops to suppress them; on the other hand, it pretends to be in favor of 'upholding human rights' and 'guaranteeing the rights of black citizens,' calling on blacks to 'endure,' and proposing a so-called 'civil rights program' in Congress to lull the fighting spirit of blacks and deceive the domestic masses." He said, "Chairman Mao's pointing out of this is very important. Today, American imperialism still uses this two-faced approach to deceive and mislead the people of the whole world."

George Magombe, the Executive Secretary of the African Liberation Committee of the Organization of African Unity, spoke here to a Xinhua News Agency reporter in his personal capacity, warmly praising Chairman Mao's statement made three years ago. He said, "Chairman Mao Zedong has always supported the struggle of the people of Asia and Africa for liberation, economic independence, and the overthrow of colonialism."

Zwane, the chief representative of the Swaziland People's Liberation Movement, said to a Xinhua News Agency reporter, "Chairman Mao foresaw the prospects of the struggle of American blacks in this statement, which is 'a statement that inspires all oppressed people in the world.' He said, 'This statement has the support of all progressive people in the world.'"

He said, "The only way to deal with racial discrimination is through the struggle of the people, through the struggle for liberation. He stressed, 'I firmly believe that with the support of the people of the world, the struggle of American blacks is our struggle. We fully support Chairman Mao's statement without reservation.'"

The representative of the All-African Trade Union Federation in the East and Central African region, Zimbili, expressed support for Chairman Mao's statement to a Xinhua News Agency reporter. He condemned the same racial discrimination policies pursued by American imperialism and the South African regime.

A professor from Senegal, Ly Tidyane Bedie, said to a Xinhua News Agency reporter in Bamako, "Chairman Mao's statement three years ago in support of the struggle of American blacks is a very positive contribution to the anti-imperialist struggle."

He said, "Chairman Mao's statement is an inspiration to American blacks, 'making them feel that they are not alone in their struggle and will draw new strength in the struggle against the international reactionary gendarmerie, for world peace and social progress.'"

He said, "This statement reveals the class nature of the struggle of American blacks against racial discrimination, thus clarifying the essence of the racial issues in the United States, South Africa, Southern Rhodesia, and other places."

    非洲公众热烈欢呼毛主席支持美国黑人的历史性声明
    毛主席声明是对世界人民反帝斗争的巨大鼓舞
    新华社达累斯萨拉姆七日电　在毛泽东主席呼吁世界人民联合起来反对美国帝国主义的种族歧视、支持美国黑人反对种族歧视的斗争的声明发表三周年的时候，坦桑尼亚朋友和在这里的非洲自由战士热烈欢呼中国人民伟大的革命领袖毛泽东主席发表的这一历史性的声明。他们认为，这项声明不仅对美国黑人而且对亚非人民，以及全世界一切被压迫人民的斗争都是“非常有益的指导”。
    一位坦桑尼亚政治家在这里对新华社记者说，毛主席在声明中指出，美国统治集团采取了阴险的两面手法。它一方面继续纵容和参与对黑人的歧视和迫害，甚至派遣军队进行镇压；另一方面，又装出一副主张“维护人权”、“保障黑人公民权利”的面孔，呼吁黑人“忍耐”，在国会里提出一套所谓“民权计划”，企图麻痹黑人的斗志，欺骗国内群众。他说，毛主席指出这一点是十分重要的。今天，美帝国主义还使用这种两面手法，来迷惑和欺骗全世界人民。
    非洲统一组织非洲解放委员会执行书记乔治·马贡贝以他个人的名义在这里对新华社记者发表谈话，热烈赞扬毛主席三年前发表的这个声明。他说：“毛泽东主席一直是支持亚非人民争取解放、争取经济独立和摆脱殖民主义的斗争的。”
    斯威士兰人民民族解放大会首席代表兹瓦尼在这里接见新华社记者时说，毛主席在这篇声明中预见了美国黑人斗争的前景，这是“一篇鼓舞全世界一切被压迫人民的声明”。他说，“这篇声明得到世界上一切进步人民的支持。”
    他说，对付种族歧视的唯一办法就是人民斗争，就是进行争取解放的战斗。他强调说，“我坚信，美国黑人得到全世界人民的支持，美国黑人的斗争就是我们的斗争，我们毫无保留地支持毛主席的声明。”
    全非工会联合会驻中东非地区代表津比希利对新华社记者表示支持毛主席的这个声明。他谴责美帝国主义和南非政权奉行同样的种族歧视政策。
    新华社巴马科八日电　塞内加尔教授利·蒂迪亚内·贝迪在这里对新华社记者说，毛主席三年前发表的支持美国黑人斗争的声明是对反帝斗争的一个十分积极的贡献。
    他说，毛主席的声明对美国黑人是一个鼓舞，“使他们感到在斗争中不是孤立的，并将在反对国际反动派宪兵、争取世界和平和社会进步的斗争中汲取新的力量。”
    他说，这个声明揭示了美国黑人反对种族歧视的斗争的阶级性，从而阐明了美国、南非、南罗得西亚和其它地方的种族问题的实质。
