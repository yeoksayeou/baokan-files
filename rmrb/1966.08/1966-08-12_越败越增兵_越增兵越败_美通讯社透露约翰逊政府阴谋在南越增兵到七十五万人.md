The more they lose, the more troops they send; the more troops they send, the more they lose. U.S. news agencies reveal Johnson administration's plot to increase troops in South Vietnam to 750,000.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on August 11th: Washington news: The Johnson administration of the United States, after its blatant bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong failed in its plot of "bombing for the sake of negotiation," is now plotting to further escalate the war of aggression against Vietnam and is hastening the implementation of its "negotiation" plot.

The U.S. military commander in Vietnam, Westmoreland, arrived in Honolulu from Saigon on the 10th to plot further steps to escalate the war of aggression against Vietnam with high-ranking U.S. military and political personnel there. Westmoreland shouted upon arriving in Honolulu, "I think we need more troops (in South Vietnam). We have almost a reinforcement unit arriving every month, for example, members of the U.S. 4th Division arrived last month."

On the eve of Westmoreland's arrival in Honolulu, U.S. news agencies and newspapers widely published messages from Saigon stating that the Pentagon advocates gradually increasing U.S. troops in Vietnam to 750,000 to reverse the defeat. U.S. news agencies also continuously report that the U.S. government is concentrating its aircraft carriers off the coast of Vietnam to the waters north of Vietnam, preparing to further intensify the bombing of North Vietnam.

In fact, U.S. President Johnson had already clearly stated at a press conference on July 20th, "We need to increase troops." According to reports, the Johnson administration plans to increase U.S. troops in Vietnam from the current 280,000 to 400,000 to 500,000 by the end of this year, and then further increase them.

Meanwhile, the Johnson administration continues to hasten the implementation of its "negotiation" trick. Johnson again repeated the old tune at a press conference on the 9th, claiming that the U.S. government is "willing to sit down at any time, any place" for negotiations. Senate Democratic leader Mansfield reiterated the U.S. government's stance on the 8th, expressing support for India's plot, under U.S. instructions, to strengthen the activities of the International Control Commission in the demilitarized zone between North and South Vietnam, as well as Thailand's plot to establish an "Asian Committee" to "peacefully resolve" the Vietnam issue.

### 越败越增兵　越增兵越败　美通讯社透露约翰逊政府阴谋在南越增兵到七十五万人

　　越败越增兵　越增兵越败
　　美通讯社透露约翰逊政府阴谋在南越增兵到七十五万人
    据新华社十一日讯　华盛顿消息：美国约翰逊政府在它悍然轰炸河内和海防的“以炸迫和”的阴谋失败后，现在又在策划进一步扩大侵略越南的战争，并加紧推行“和谈”阴谋。
    侵越美军头子威斯特摩兰已经在十日从西贡抵达檀香山，同美国在那里的高级军政人员策划进一步扩大侵越战争的步骤。威斯特摩兰在抵达檀香山时叫嚷说，“我认为需要派更多的军队（到南越）。我们差不多每一个月都有增援部队到达，例如上月份（美国）第四师的成员已经到达。”
    在威斯特摩兰抵达檀香山的前夕，美国通讯社和报刊广泛刊载发自西贡的消息说，五角大楼主张把侵越美军逐步增加到七十五万人来挽救败局。美国通讯社还不断报道，美国政府正在把它在越南沿海的航空母舰集中到越南北方海面，准备进一步加紧对越南北方的轰炸。
    美国总统约翰逊其实早就在七月二十日的记者招待会上明白地说，“需要增加兵员”。据报道，约翰逊政府计划到今年年底把侵越美军从目前的二十八万多人增加到四、五十万人，以后再进一步增加。
    与此同时，约翰逊政府继续在加紧玩弄“和谈”花招。约翰逊在九日的记者招待会上又一次老调重弹，扬言美国政府“愿意在任何时候、任何地方坐下来”谈判。参议院民主党领袖曼斯菲尔德八日重申美国政府的态度，表示支持印度在美国指使下策划的所谓加强国际监督委员会驻在越南南北两方之间的非军事区内的巡逻活动的阴谋以及泰国关于设立一个“亚洲委员会”来“和平解决”越南问题的阴谋。
