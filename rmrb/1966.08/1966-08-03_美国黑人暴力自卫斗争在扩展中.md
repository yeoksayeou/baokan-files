The struggle for black self-defense in the United States is expanding. Black people across the country have been bravely fighting back against the oppression of the military and police, shouting the slogan "Black Power."

An American publication laments that the United States is facing a stormy period of black struggle.

New China News Agency, August 2nd: Washington - Black people across the United States, undeterred by the threats and intimidation of the ruling authorities and the terrorist activities of white racists, continue to raise the banner of violent self-defense, fighting unyieldingly.

On the night of July 31st, the police in Omaha, Nebraska, unjustly arrested a black person, which sparked the indignation of over 150 nearby black people who questioned the police. The authorities sent about 170 police officers to suppress the protest. The police even shot and injured an 18-year-old black youth. The black people immediately retaliated with bricks, bottles, and homemade Molotov cocktails, and the struggle continued until the morning of August 1st. Before this, black people in Omaha had already held a three-day violent self-defense struggle on July 4th.

On the night of July 30th, the police in the Watts area of Los Angeles harassed a black person without reason, which also provoked questions from about 300 nearby black people. The authorities sent a large number of police cars and reinforcements to suppress the protest. The black people bravely fought back with stones and bottles.

On the evening of July 28th, a violent self-defense struggle also erupted in North Amityville, 40 miles from New York City. At that time, over 400 black people were holding a meeting to denounce the discrimination and persecution by the ruling authorities. The authorities sent over 150 police officers wearing steel helmets to suppress the protest. The black people quickly retaliated with stones and homemade Molotov cocktails, shouting the slogan "Black Power." The struggle lasted for over three hours.

Over 100 black people in Somerville, Tennessee, held a five-day "Freedom March" from July 23rd to 27th, covering four counties. At the end of this march, the black people held a meeting, shouting the slogan "Black Power."

The violent self-defense struggles of black people across the United States are taking place as the U.S. government and racists intensify their persecution of black people. In recent days, incidents of white racists provoking, brutally beating, and oppressing black people have been rampant. U.S. President Johnson delivered two consecutive speeches threatening black people on July 20th and 23rd, declaring that the U.S. government "refuses to forgive riots and disturbances." U.S. Vice President Humphrey also followed suit on the 28th, shouting, "Riots and violence are intolerable and unforgivable." However, Johnson and Humphrey's threats do not intimidate the brave black people of the United States but only further expose their reactionary and ugly faces. The July 18th issue of *U.S. News & World Report* magazine, discussing the current situation of the black movement in the United States, lamented that despite the Johnson administration's use of both "soft" and "hard" tactics, the broad masses of black people have not submitted, and the black movement is becoming increasingly militant and more in favor of using violence. This magazine worriedly admitted that the United States is facing a "stormy period" of black struggle.

    美国黑人暴力自卫斗争在扩展中
    各地黑人连日英勇反击军警的镇压并高呼“黑人要权力”的口号
    美刊哀叹美国面临黑人斗争的暴风雨时刻
    新华社二日讯　华盛顿消息：美国各地黑人不顾美国统治当局的恐吓和威胁以及白人种族主义者的恐怖活动，继续高举暴力自卫斗争的旗帜，进行不屈不挠的斗争。
    七月三十一日深夜，内布拉斯加州奥马哈市的警察无理逮捕一名黑人的暴行，激起了附近一百五十多名黑人的义愤，他们向警察进行质问。当局竟派出约一百七十名警察赶去镇压，警察还开枪打伤了一名十八岁的黑人青年。黑人们立即用砖头、瓶子和自制燃烧瓶进行反击，斗争一直延续到八月一日清晨。在这以前，奥马哈市黑人在七月四日曾举行过一次连续三天的暴力自卫斗争。
    七月三十日深夜，洛杉矶市瓦茨区的警察无端迫害一个黑人，也引起了附近约三百名黑人的质问。当局派去大批警车和增援警察，进行镇压。黑人们用石块和瓶子英勇地进行回击。
    七月二十八日晚上在离纽约市四十英里的北亚密特维尔也爆发了黑人暴力自卫斗争。当时四百多名黑人正在举行集会，控诉统治当局对他们的歧视和迫害。统治当局竟派出了一百五十余名头戴钢盔的警察去镇压。黑人们迅速用石块和自制燃烧瓶进行回击，并高呼“黑人要权力”的口号。斗争一直进行了三个多小时。
    田纳西州萨默维尔的一百多名黑人，从七月二十三日到二十七日，举行了历时五天、行程四个县的“田纳西州西部的自由进军”。在这次进军结束时，黑人们还举行集会，高呼“黑人要权力”的口号。
    美国各地黑人的暴力自卫斗争是在美国政府和种族主义者加紧它们对黑人的迫害的情况下展开的。最近一些天来，美国种族主义者向黑人挑衅、疯狂殴打和压迫黑人的事件层出不穷。美国总统约翰逊七月二十日和二十三日接连发表了两次威胁黑人的讲话，叫嚷美国政府“拒绝宽恕暴乱和骚乱”。美国副总统汉弗莱二十八日也跟着叫嚷说，“暴乱和暴力是不能容忍和宽恕的”。但是约翰逊、汉弗莱的恫吓吓不倒英勇的美国黑人，而只能进一步暴露了他们反动的丑恶嘴脸。七月十八日一期的《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志在谈到当前美国黑人运动的形势时哀叹，尽管约翰逊政府“软”、“硬”兼施，但是广大黑人并没有屈服，“黑人运动正在越来越富有战斗性”，“越来越同意使用暴力”。这家杂志忧心忡忡地承认，美国正在面临黑人斗争的“暴风雨似的时刻”。
