A mass movement to emulate the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has reached a new high on the occasion of the PLA's 39th anniversary. The people of the entire nation, with hearts full of excitement, have declared: We will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, take the PLA as our model, and transform every sector into a revolutionary school that combines work, agriculture, culture, and military training.

Today, as the nation celebrates the 39th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals have seen the editorial "The Whole Nation Should Become a Big School of Mao Zedong Thought" published in the People's Daily. They have learned that Chairman Mao recently instructed the PLA to be a big school and called on the people of the whole nation to follow the example of the PLA and transform every sector into a revolutionary school. Upon learning of Chairman Mao's great call, people are extremely excited and are spreading the news to each other. People enthusiastically say: This is wonderful, this is timely, this is a document of great historical significance, this is our action plan. Many units immediately held meetings to discuss and study the experiences of the PLA; many units invited local military personnel to give reports, introducing the deeds and experiences of building a school of Mao Zedong Thought. The young militia members and demobilized soldiers of the Beijing Grape Wine Factory, during the activities commemorating the "August 1" Army Day, after studying Chairman Mao's instructions, are full of spirit and are studying how to take work as the main focus, also learn military, political, and cultural knowledge, also engage in the socialist education movement, and also criticize the bourgeoisie. This factory has a large vineyard, and the workers have expressed their determination to do a good job in agricultural and sideline production, just like the Daqing Oil Field. They say: We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, learn from the PLA, and make every person able to wield a hammer to work, a hoe to farm, a rifle to fight the enemy, and a pen to write articles, truly becoming critics of the old world, builders and defenders of the new world. Many factories, people's communes, schools, shops, and party and government organs in Tianjin also expressed their determination to follow the example of the PLA and build schools of Mao Zedong Thought. The Tianjin Second Bicycle Factory, which has been paying attention to learning military skills among workers for many years, has a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's strategic instruction. They said that in the future, they will not only focus on work and learn military skills well, but also learn politics and culture, truly becoming new people of communism. The cadres and community members of Shaoshan People's Commune in Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, Chairman Mao's hometown, seriously studied Chairman Mao's important instructions today and decided to build Shaoshan according to Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts.

On the eve of "August 1," the activities of learning from the PLA are being carried out vigorously across the country. Revolutionary masses say: We must learn the good thoughts, good styles, good traditions, and good experiences of the PLA, promote the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new high, and promote the deepening of the Cultural Revolution. In the Daqing Oil Field, workers have decided to follow the example of the PLA, taking Chairman Mao's works wherever they go, and spreading Mao Zedong Thought wherever they go. Many demobilized soldiers also held symposiums, sharing their experiences of growing up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, and expressing their determination to always maintain the glorious traditions and revolutionary spirit of the PLA, and always be good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

The people of the Xingtai region, who have suffered severe earthquakes, have been holding meetings these days, expressing their boundless love for the PLA. They say: The great Mao Zedong Thought that the PLA planted during the disaster has given us boundless strength. In the future, we will definitely take the PLA as our model, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and strive for double victories in revolution and production construction. In the southeastern coastal and southwestern border areas, people are inviting local military personnel to introduce their experiences of studying Chairman Mao's works. The propaganda team of the "Tashan Hero Regiment" of the Guangzhou Military Region, consisting of more than 140 officers and soldiers, was warmly welcomed in the countryside. Mao Zedong Thought study activist, political instructor Feng Fusheng of a certain unit of the Air Force, introduced his experiences of studying Chairman Mao's works when he went to the local people's commune. Many community members said: He really spoke to our hearts, and in the future, we will definitely read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Tianjin, Harbin, Taiyuan, Wuhan, Xi'an, Nanjing, Jinan, Hangzhou, Kunming, Urumqi, Hohhot, and other cities held grand commemorative meetings for "August 1" Army Day, military-civilian celebration evenings, or support-the-military and prefer-the-veterans meetings. At the meetings, local party, government, and military leaders celebrated the festival with tens of thousands of workers, peasants, and soldiers. At the celebration evening held in Beijing tonight, Beijing Municipal Committee Secretary Ma Li called on the people of Beijing to actively respond to Chairman Mao's great call and promote the activities of learning from the PLA to a new stage.

During this period, many regions organized delegation teams to warmly visit local troops, families of martyrs and veterans, and disabled soldiers. Many regions also organized inspection teams to deeply understand the thoughts, production, and living conditions of the families of martyrs and veterans, and help them solve various practical problems.

    今天，正当全国欢庆人民解放军建军三十九周年的时候，广大工农兵群众、革命干部和革命知识分子，看到了《人民日报》发表的《全国都应该成为毛泽东思想的大学校》的社论，知道了毛主席最近指示人民解放军应该是一个大学校，并号召全国人民象解放军那样，把各行各业都办成革命化的大学校。人们知道毛主席的这一伟大号召后，兴奋异常，纷纷奔走相告。人们激动地说：太好了，太及时了，这是具有伟大历史意义的文献，是我们的行动纲领。许多单位立即开会座谈讨论，学习解放军的经验；许多单位邀请驻地部队指战员作报告，介绍办毛泽东思想大学校的事迹和经验。北京葡萄酒厂的青年民兵和转业复员军人，在纪念“八一”建军节的活动中，学习了毛主席的指示以后，意气风发地研究如何以工为主、也兼学军事、政治、文化，也搞社会主义教育运动、也批判资产阶级。这个酒厂有个很大的葡萄园，工人们表示一定象大庆油田那样，搞好农副业生产。他们说：我们一定高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大学解放军，使每个人拿起锤子能做工，拿起锄头能种田，拿起枪杆子能打敌人，拿起笔杆子能写文章，真正成为旧世界的批判者，新世界的建设者和保卫者。天津市许多工厂、农村人民公社、学校、商店和党政机关也纷纷表示象解放军那样，办成毛泽东思想的大学校。几年来一直在工人中注意学军事的天津第二自行车厂，职工们对毛主席这一具有战略意义的指示，有着比较深刻的体会，他们表示今后不仅要以工为主，学好军事，还要学政治、学文化，真正成为共产主义的新人。毛主席的家乡湖南湘潭县韶山公社广大干部和社员，今天认真学习了毛主席最近发出的这一重要指示，决心按照毛主席这个光辉思想来建设韶山。

    曾遭受严重地震灾害的邢台地区人民，这几天都满怀对解放军无限热爱的心情，纷纷集会倾吐自己对解放军的感激。他们说：解放军在救灾时播下的伟大的毛泽东思想，使我们增添了无穷的力量，今后一定以解放军为榜样，活学活用毛主席著作，争取革命和生产建设双胜利。在东南沿海和西南边疆，人们纷纷邀请驻地部队指战员介绍学习毛主席著作的经验。广州部队某部“塔山英雄团”派出的由一百四十多名干部战士组成的毛泽东思想宣传队，到了农村，处处受到欢迎。学习毛主席著作积极分子、空军某部指导员丰福生到驻地人民公社介绍学习毛主席著作体会时，许多社员说：真讲到心坎上了，今后一定好好读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。

    这期间，许多地区组织了慰问团，热情慰问当地驻军、烈军属和残废军人。许多地区还组织检查组，深入了解烈军属的思想、生产和生活情况，帮助他们解决各种实际问题。
