Mid-July, more than 8,000 U.S. aggressor troops, together with 3,000 South Vietnamese puppet soldiers, launched a large-scale "sweep" in the northern part of Quang Tri Province. The armed forces of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, together with local residents, bravely confronted the enemy. In the course of several days of battle, the bodies of U.S. aggressor troops littered the ground. The liberation forces also shot down a large number of U.S. helicopters. According to reports from Western news agencies, in the battles of the 15th and 16th alone, more than ten U.S. helicopters were shot down.

The left image is from the August 1st issue of the U.S. *Newsweek* magazine, which published two photographs related to this battle. A U.S. aggressor helicopter was hit by ground fire from the South Vietnamese liberation forces, caught fire (top right), and crashed near the U.S. aggressor troops' position. Smoke billowed, and the U.S. aggressor troops on the position were in a state of panic, throwing away their helmets and armor, and fleeing in disarray.

    看，美国侵略军逃命的狼狈相
    七月中旬，美国侵略军八千多名伙同三千名南越伪军在广治省北部发动了一次大规模的“扫荡”。越南南方解放武装力量同当地居民一起，奋勇迎击敌人。在历时数日的战斗中，美国侵略军遗尸遍野。解放武装力量还击落了大批美国直升飞机。据西方通讯社报道，仅仅在十五、十六两日的战斗中，就有十多架美国直升飞机被击落。
    左图是八月一日出版的美国《新闻周刊》刊登的有关这次战役的两幅照片。一架美国侵略军直升飞机为南越解放武装力量地面炮火击中起火（图上角），坠落在美国侵略军的阵地附近，浓烟弥漫，阵地上的美国侵略军士兵惊惶万状，丢盔弃甲，纷纷逃命。
