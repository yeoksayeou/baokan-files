Foreign friends praise Chairman Mao's brilliant assertion that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers.

According to Xinhua News Agency, people from Pakistan, Mexico, Palestine, and Tanzania have praised Chairman Mao's brilliant assertion that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers.

The Executive Secretary of the Pakistan Writers' Association and renowned Pakistani writer Shaukat Siddiqui said that Chairman Mao's assertion that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers has illuminated the path of struggle for all oppressed peoples around the world. He said that this famous assertion is now being proven by the iron-clad facts that emerge daily in Vietnam. The well-equipped American aggressors are being annihilated by the Vietnamese people every day. U.S. imperialism will inevitably be driven out of Vietnam.

Pakistani writer Amanullah said that the claim that one cannot offend U.S. imperialism because it has nuclear teeth and must "coexist peacefully" with it is a fallacy.

The Chairman of the All-Pakistan Students Federation, Majeed Muhammad Khan, praised Chairman Mao's assertion as the essence of Marxism-Leninism, which has greatly inspired Pakistani youth and students. He said, "This assertion must guide all revolutionaries in their struggle to create a new world."

He pointed out that those who oppose Chairman Mao's assertion are "those who oppose the revolutionary struggle of the oppressed peoples, who want to dampen the people's fighting spirit, and who, in fact, collude with imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism. They are modern revisionists."

The Chairman of the Pakistan-China Friendship Association in Lahore, Montaz Ahmed Khan, pointed out that Chairman Mao's assertion "brilliantly demonstrates the wisdom, foresight, and vision of a great figure of our time."

Recently, Carlos Zapata Bera, a prominent figure in the legal community and former legislator from Mexico, told a Xinhua News Agency reporter that Chairman Mao's great, comprehensive assertion that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers should be a required reading for the peoples of Latin America.

He said that U.S. imperialism uses its political, economic, military, and cultural power to invade Latin America at will. In addition, it colludes with local reactionaries in Latin America to control the continent. He warned that their plots will not succeed. The peoples of Latin America are becoming more courageous and are rising up to wage fierce struggles, because countless facts have proven that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers.

Zapata said, "Mao Zedong's assertion has a profound impact on the revolutionary movement that is shaking the world today. He said, Mao Zedong Thought has shown the peoples of the world a path of struggle, the most glorious path in human history."

The head of the Palestine Liberation Organization's office in Damascus, Yousuf Abdul-Rahim, said that Chairman Mao's assertion that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers has greatly encouraged us and given us the confidence to eliminate imperialism.

A Tanzanian national leader said that he fully agrees with Chairman Mao's assertion when analyzing that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers: "Strategically, we must despise all enemies, but tactically, we must take all enemies seriously." He said that this point can be applied in Tanzania's struggle against colonialism and imperialism's subversion and aggression.

A Tanzanian politician told a Xinhua News Agency reporter that Chairman Mao's assertion "is very meaningful and beneficial to all peoples of the world who are fighting. Once people have this confidence, they can defeat and will definitely defeat the enemy."

He said, as Chairman Mao correctly pointed out, imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers.

A leader of a mass organization in Zanzibar told a Xinhua News Agency reporter, "U.S. imperialists have modern weapons and atomic bombs, but the decisive factor is not weapons, but the people. When the peoples of the world unite and decide to eradicate all imperialism and reactionaries, they will definitely achieve victory."

A young worker in Zanzibar, when discussing the experience of the Zanzibar Revolution, told the reporter: "The people of Zanzibar, armed only with sticks, knives, and spears, overthrew the Sultanate regime, which was equipped with modern weapons under the support of British imperialism. The victory of the Zanzibar Revolution completely proves the correctness of Chairman Mao's assertion."

    戳穿纸老虎　创造新世界
    外国朋友盛赞毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断
    据新华社讯　巴基斯坦、墨西哥、巴勒斯坦和坦桑尼亚人士赞扬毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断。
    巴基斯坦作家协会执行秘书、巴基斯坦著名作家肖卡特·西迪基说，毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的论断照亮了全世界一切被压迫人民胜利前进的斗争道路。他说，毛主席的这一著名论断现在正为越南每天出现的铁的事实所证明。装备精良的美国侵略者每天被越南人民所歼灭。美帝国主义必将被赶出越南。
    巴基斯坦作家阿马努拉说，所谓不能触犯美帝国主义，因为它有核牙齿，必须同它“和平共处”。这种说法是一种谬论。
    巴基斯坦全国学生联合会主席迈拉杰·穆罕默德汗赞扬毛主席的这一论断是马克思列宁主义的精华，给了巴基斯坦青年和学生极大的鼓舞。他说，“必须用这个论断来指导一切革命者创造新世界的斗争。”
    他指出，那些反对毛主席的这个论断的人“就是反对被压迫人民的革命斗争的人，他们想使人民的斗志消沉，他们实际上同帝国主义，特别是同美帝国主义勾结。他们就是现代修正主义者。”
    拉合尔巴基斯坦—中国友好协会主席蒙塔兹·艾哈迈德汗指出，毛主席的论断“光辉地表明了当代伟大的杰出人物的智慧、预见和远见”。
    墨西哥法律界著名人士、前议员卡洛斯·萨帕塔·贝拉最近对新华社记者发表谈话说，毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎这个伟大的概括性的论断应该成为拉丁美洲各国人民的必读教材。
    他说，美帝国主义利用它的政治、经济、军事和文化，对拉丁美洲进行随心所欲的侵略，此外，它勾结拉丁美洲本地的反动派来控制本大陆。他警告说，它们的阴谋不会得逞。拉丁美洲各国人民勇气倍增，他们起来进行激烈的斗争，因为无数事实已经证明，帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。
    萨帕塔说，“毛泽东的这一论断在目前震撼世界的革命运动中的影响是十分重大的。他说，毛泽东思想为世界各国人民指出了一条斗争的道路，一条人类历史上最光辉的道路。”
    巴勒斯坦解放组织驻大马士革办事处主任优素福·阿卜杜勒·拉希姆说，毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的论断大大鼓舞了我们，使我们树立了消灭帝国主义的信心。
    坦桑尼亚一位国家领导人说，他完全同意毛主席在分析帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎时所提出的论断：“在战略上我们要藐视一切敌人，在战术上我们要重视一切敌人。”他说，在坦桑尼亚反对殖民主义和帝国主义的颠覆和侵略的斗争中，可以运用这个论点。
    一位坦桑尼亚政治家对新华社记者发表谈话说，毛泽东主席的这一论断，“对世界上一切正在进行斗争的人民都是很有意义的，很有益处的。人民一旦有了这种信心，他们就能够打败而且一定会打败敌人”。
    他说，正如毛泽东主席正确指出的那样，帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。
    桑给巴尔一个群众团体的领导人对新华社记者说，“美帝国主义者拥有现代化武器，有原子弹，但是决定性的因素不是武器，而是人民。当世界人民团结起来决心根除一切帝国主义和反动派的时候，他们就一定能够得到胜利。”
    桑给巴尔一位青年工作者在谈到桑给巴尔革命的经验时对记者说：“桑给巴尔人民只用棍、刀和矛就推翻了在英帝国主义支持下用现代武器装备起来的苏丹政权。桑给巴尔革命的胜利完全证实了毛主席论断的正确。”
