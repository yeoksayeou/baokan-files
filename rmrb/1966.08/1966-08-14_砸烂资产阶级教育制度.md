	Chairman Mao's great directive is like the sunshine of spring, illuminating our hearts. We must smash the bourgeois education system in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	The phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools can no longer be tolerated. As soon as we stepped into the Beijing Institute of Chemical Technology, the school began to vigorously promote the idea that "Beijing Institute of Chemical Technology is a higher institution for cultivating high-level chemical engineering personnel. In five years of university, one must complete the basic training of an engineer." The so-called "professors" and "scholars" that the school gathered also spread to us a set of bourgeois, seriously detached from reality, and from book to book methods of study, using various frameworks to restrict the students' hands and feet. The Institute of Chemical Technology is supposed to be about chemical industry, but the school makes students bury themselves in books. After three years of studying at the Institute of Chemical Technology, students still do not know what a chemical factory looks like.

	Not only that, these bourgeois intellectuals also use the lectern in every possible way to instill in us the idea of fame and wealth, corrupting the youth and serving their bourgeois educational line. Old colleges and universities all emphasize the word "high." What higher institutions of learning, what profound theories, what cultivation of high-level talents, all propagandize the idea of being superior to others. One teacher, while lecturing on the molding curve of plastics, used his finger to trace another curve upward and raised his voice to say, "From here, one can get high bonuses!" Look! These bourgeois intellectuals are so arrogant, using such fallacies as high bonuses and high salaries to corrupt us.

	Under the influence of this kind of thinking, many of our classmates have been poisoned by the idea of fame and wealth, falling into the quagmire of bourgeois individualism. Some classmates, after graduation, even took the wrong path because they could not achieve their personal desire to become famous and successful.

	Since bourgeois intellectuals rule our school, they will not implement the Party's class line. They always try to suppress and marginalize workers and peasants' students. One of their methods is to use "grades" as a noose, putting it around our necks. Many children of workers and peasants have been forced to ignore politics and bury themselves in books just to pass this "grade" hurdle. "Grades" have actually become a tool for bourgeois intellectuals to exercise dictatorship over workers and peasants' students.

	Chairman Mao said: The school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools can no longer be tolerated. Chairman Mao's great directive is like the sunshine of spring, illuminating our hearts. Chairman Mao's great call has inspired our courage to open fire on the old world. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and, in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, smash the bourgeois education system to smithereens.

　　砸烂资产阶级教育制度
　　北京化工学院有机系六一级　哀祖仁　许采文　李如兰　王文龙
　　毛主席的伟大指示，象春天的阳光，照亮了我们的心。我们一定要在这场文化大革命中，砸烂资产阶级教育制度。
    资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，确实再也不能继续下去了。当我们一跨进北京化工学院的大门，学校就向我们极力鼓吹什么：“北京化工学院是培养高级化工技术人材的高等学府，在大学五年里，要完成工程师的基本训练。”学校搜罗来的一些资产阶级的“教授”“学者”，也向我们传播一套套资产阶级的、严重脱离实际的、从书本到书本的治学之道，用种种框框束缚学生的手脚。化工学院本来是搞化学工业的，学校却叫学生钻书堆，同学们在化工学院念了三年书，还不知道化工厂是什么样子。
    不但如此，这些资产阶级知识分子还利用讲台千方百计向我们灌输名利思想，腐蚀青年，为他们的资产阶级教育路线服务。旧的大专学校，都强调一个“高”字。什么高等学府，讲的是高深理论，培养高等人材，大肆宣扬高人一等的思想。有一个教师，一次在讲塑料成型曲线的时候，他用手指沿着另一条曲线往上一划，提高嗓子说：“从这里就可以得到高奖金！”看！这些资产阶级知识分子就这样猖狂地用什么高奖金、高薪等物质刺激谬论来腐蚀我们。
    在他们这种思想的影响下，不少同学中了名利思想的毒，掉进了资产阶级个人主义的泥坑，有个别同学毕业后甚至因为不能达到他个人成名成家的欲望而走上了邪路。
    资产阶级知识分子统治着我们学校，当然就不会贯彻党的阶级路线。他们总是极力打击、排挤工农学生，其中一条办法就是把“分”当作绞索，套在我们脖子上。许多工农子弟都为过这个“分”关而被迫不问政治，埋头读书。“分”，实际上就成了资产阶级知识分子对工农同学实行专政的一种手段。
    毛主席说：学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。毛主席的伟大指示，象春天的阳光，照亮了我们的心。毛主席的伟大号召鼓舞了我们向旧世界开火的勇气。我们一定要遵循毛主席的教导，在这场文化大革命中，把资产阶级教育制度砸个稀巴烂。
