Thirty years ago, in the revolutionary holy land of Yanan, beneath the towering Qingliang Mountain and beside the roaring Yanan River, a new type of proletarian revolutionary school was born—The Chinese People's Anti-Japanese Military and Political University (commonly known as the Anti-Japanese University). Under the direct leadership and care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the Anti-Japanese University raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, grew and flourished rapidly, and in just nine years, cultivated more than ten thousand revolutionary cadres, making significant contributions to the liberation of the Chinese people.

The Anti-Japanese University is the most comprehensive and vivid example of implementing Chairman Mao's great educational thoughts. It carried out a complete set of proletarian educational policies, educational guidelines, teaching systems, and teaching methods, setting a shining example for building a proletarian revolutionary school.

The exhibition on the history of the Anti-Japanese University, which opened on August 1st at the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Museum, introduces this most advanced, revolutionary, and progressive school through several hundred precious revolutionary relics, photographs, and documents.

Today, as people visit the exhibition and review the history of the Anti-Japanese University, it is as if they have personally participated in the fiery struggle of the Anti-Japanese University back then, receiving a profound education in the living Mao Zedong Thought. They are determined to take the Anti-Japanese University as an example, carry forward the spirit of thorough proletarian revolution, and smash all reactionary bourgeois educational thoughts and systems to pieces; to turn all schools in our country into Anti-Japanese University-style proletarian revolutionary schools, and let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high on the educational front of our country.

Under the Direct Leadership and Care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao

The Anti-Japanese University was established under the direct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao; it grew under the sunshine and dew of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's important instructions and teachings on the Anti-Japanese University ensured that it advanced steadily on the path of proletarian revolutionization. Chairman Mao's many personal inscriptions and letters to the Anti-Japanese University are now on display here.

"For a military school, the most important issue is the selection of the principal and teachers and the determination of the educational policy." Chairman Mao's instruction is prominently displayed at the front of the exhibition hall. This is the core issue of turning the Anti-Japanese University into a proletarian revolutionary school. For this reason, Chairman Mao personally served as the chairman of the Anti-Japanese University Education Committee and sent his closest comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, to serve as the principal and political commissar of the Anti-Japanese University. Chairman Mao also personally inscribed "Loyal to the Party's educational cause" for the Anti-Japanese University's faculty, instructing all faculty members to dedicate themselves wholeheartedly to the proletarian educational cause. This inscription, written in gold characters on a red velvet screen in the exhibition hall, is even more dazzling.

On the red velvet screen at the entrance of the hall, there are three sentences in gold characters: "Firm and correct political direction, hardworking and frugal work style, flexible and mobile strategy and tactics." Eight characters: "Unity, tension, seriousness, liveliness." These are the educational policies and school spirit personally formulated by Chairman Mao for the Anti-Japanese University. In the glass case, there is a manuscript of Chairman Mao's article "Being Opposed by the Enemy Is a Good Thing, Not a Bad Thing," written in 1939 to commemorate the third anniversary of the Anti-Japanese University, which clearly stipulates the above educational policy.

Chairman Mao personally gave lectures at the Anti-Japanese University, frequently gave instructions to the Anti-Japanese University, and often went among the students to have heart-to-heart talks. Our great leader Chairman Mao's approachable and people-oriented style is forever a shining example for every revolutionary to learn from.

Photographs truly record the scenes of Chairman Mao and other leaders of the Party Central Committee giving lectures and reports at the Anti-Japanese University at that time. Many of Chairman Mao's important works, such as "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War," "On Practice," and "On Contradiction," were lectured on at the Anti-Japanese University. Liu Shaoqi's "On the Cultivation of Communist Party Members" was also a basic textbook for the ideological education of Anti-Japanese University students. Here, there are also original manuscripts or transcriptions of speeches and reports given by Comrades Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Lin Biao, and Deng Xiaoping to Anti-Japanese University students.

Under the direct leadership and care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the students of the Anti-Japanese University quickly armed themselves with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. When they graduated, Chairman Mao personally inscribed for them: "Brave, steadfast, and calm. Learn from struggle. Be prepared to sacrifice everything for the cause of national liberation at any time!" Each class of students remembered the leader's teachings, rushed to the anti-Japanese front, went deep into the enemy's rear, and engaged in heroic and outstanding struggles against Japanese invaders.

The Works of Chairman Mao Are the Basic Textbooks of the Anti-Japanese University

In the center of the Anti-Japanese University history exhibition hall, a glass case under the gold-character title "Using Chairman Mao's books as the guiding direction and Chairman Mao's works as the basic textbooks" neatly displays several dozen brilliant works written by Chairman Mao during the Second Revolutionary Civil War and the Anti-Japanese War, such as "On Tactics Against Japanese Imperialism," "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War," "On Practice," "On Contradiction," "On Prolonged War," "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," "On New Democracy," and "Reform Our Study." These works are the basic textbooks for the Anti-Japanese University students. Students learned politics, class struggle theory, Chairman Mao's brilliant philosophical thoughts, and the people's war thoughts and strategic and tactical principles to defeat Japanese imperialism directly from Chairman Mao's works.

The Party's theory and strategy of the anti-Japanese national united front are an important weapon to defeat Japanese imperialism and are also one of the most important courses for Anti-Japanese University students who bear the heavy responsibility of anti-Japanese and national salvation. In the displayed inscription by Chairman Mao for the ninth team of the Anti-Japanese University in 1937, it is pointed out: "These two characters of 'anti-Japanese' are your and the entire nation's only ultimate goal in this stage. The path to achieve this goal is the anti-Japanese national united front. I hope you will study the theory and methods of this united front, and only the united front can achieve the goal of anti-Japanese."

The glass case displays Chairman Mao's works such as "On Tactics Against Japanese Imperialism," "The Position of the Chinese Communist Party in the National War," "The Issue of Independence Within the United Front," and "Problems of War and Strategy," which are the basic textbooks for Anti-Japanese University students to study the theory of the united front. Chairman Mao also personally taught the course on the anti-Japanese national united front to the students. A photograph next to Chairman Mao's personal inscription for the ninth team of the Anti-Japanese University records the true scene of the second batch of Anti-Japanese University students listening to Chairman Mao's report on the issue of unity against Japan in the square. Chairman Mao's thoughts on the anti-Japanese national united front armed the students of the Anti-Japanese University, who went deep into the enemy's rear and, in the complex struggle, always adhered to the correct political direction, adhered to the united front, adhered to the principle of independence within the united front, and closely relied on the masses, mobilized the masses, and moved from victory to greater victory.

Chairman Mao's great people's war thoughts are the most basic and important course for Anti-Japanese University students to learn military affairs. Here, a 1937 mimeographed copy of "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War" is displayed, along with a bound volume of "On Prolonged War" and "Problems of Strategy in Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Warfare" stamped with the seal of the third branch of the Anti-Japanese University. The paper of these two books has turned yellow, and the covers are slightly damaged. One can imagine how many revolutionary cadres have read these two works by Chairman Mao and how many people have learned the people's war thoughts of drowning Japanese imperialism in the vast sea from them, thus establishing immortal merits for the victory of the Anti-Japanese War.

In the exhibition hall, visitors excitedly read a passage from Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report to the Seventh National Congress of the Party on behalf of the Party Central Committee: "The current important task is to mobilize the entire Party to study Mao Zedong Thought, propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and use Mao Zedong Thought to arm our Party members and revolutionary people, making Mao Zedong Thought an actual and irresistible force.... All Party schools and training classes must use the works of Comrade Mao Zedong as basic textbooks; ..." From here, visitors have a deeper understanding: all our schools must use the works of Chairman Mao as basic textbooks and make arming students with Mao Zedong Thought the most fundamental task. Only in this way can we truly turn our schools into bases for cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Class Struggle—The Most Important Course of the Anti-Japanese University

Following Chairman Mao's teachings, the Anti-Japanese University resolutely took class struggle as the main course and cultivated and trained proletarian revolutionary cadres. Many documents, photographs, and materials displayed in the exhibition hall vividly and vividly introduce how Anti-Japanese University students studied this main course of class struggle.

Many photographs record the scenes of Anti-Japanese University students going out of the school gates to participate in mass political activities outside the school: they participated in mass rallies in Yanan, demanding that the Kuomintang government stop the civil war and unite to resist Japan; they joined with various sectors of Yanan to angrily denounce the crimes of the Kuomintang reactionaries in creating divisions and surrendering to the Japanese invaders. Anti-Japanese University students closely integrated their learning and living with the Anti-Japanese War and the struggle of the masses. They were both participants in class struggle and learners of this main course in the practice of class struggle. They not only learned in the caves of Yanan but also on the battlefield of the Anti-Japanese War. The Anti-Japanese battlefield was the most vivid and effective large classroom for Anti-Japanese University students to learn class struggle. As Chairman Mao instructed, "Learn from struggle" and "Learn war from war."

Following the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the main campus of the Anti-Japanese University advanced to the enemy's rear to establish the school. Under the general title "Learning and Fighting in the Enemy's Rear," a series of photographs and reports taken on the spot at that time vividly record the scenes of Anti-Japanese University teachers and students learning and fighting in the enemy's rear. A map of the Hongling battle and related materials about the Hongling battle attracted the audience. This was one of the many battles in which the main campus of the Anti-Japanese University participated. In October 1940, the Japanese invaders launched a brutal "sweeping" operation against our Taihang Mountain base area. The main campus of the Anti-Japanese University was ordered to dispatch five companies to block the enemy in the Hongling Village area of Jin Dongnan Taihang Mountain and cover the safe transfer of rear organizations and the masses. From dawn to midnight, the Japanese invaders, under the cover of aircraft, artillery, and smoke screens, launched four consecutive assaults, all of which were repulsed by the teachers and students of the Anti-Japanese University, successfully completing the blocking mission. In actual combat, students tested the results of their learning of Chairman Mao's military thoughts, and through the practice of personal combat, they further deepened their understanding of Chairman Mao's military thoughts. In the glass case below the map of the Hongling battle, there are several summaries of the Hongling battle. These were written by the students after the battle ended and are another achievement of their active learning and application of Chairman Mao's military theory in practice.

Many photographs and reports displayed here also introduce Anti-Japanese University students organizing mass work teams to participate in the struggle for rent reduction and interest reduction; some Anti-Japanese University students went deep into the areas occupied by the Japanese invaders along the Zhengtai Railway, mobilized the masses, and carried out work in the enemy-occupied areas; they shed their blood on the land of the motherland recovered from the Japanese invaders.

A copy of the North China edition of the "New China Daily" reported on the situation of Anti-Japanese University students participating in the battle to attack the enemy in Neiqu. The report said: "The students of the Anti-Japanese University who participated in the battle did not shy away from hardships and studied experience in this battle and propagated to the masses." In the fiery classroom of class struggle, Anti-Japanese University students tempered themselves into revolutionary cadres with firm positions, clear directions, who could fight and do mass work.

Our beloved leader Chairman Mao teaches us: class struggle is a main course for the youth, and the youth should put the firm and correct political direction in the first place. Chairman Mao also instructs us: "The successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution are produced in the struggle of the masses and grow up in the tempering of great revolutionary storms and stresses." Chairman Mao's teachings are the greatest concern and love for our country's youth, clearly pointing out the core issue of educational revolution and the fundamental path to cultivating successors to the proletarian revolution. The students of the Anti-Japanese University took big steps on this path and set an example.

The Path of Educating and Transforming Intellectual Youth in the Anti-Japanese University: Implementing the Combination of Education and Productive Labor

The outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the Chinese Communist Party raised high the great banner of the Anti-Japanese National Revolutionary War, became the core force leading the nation's resistance, and Yanan became the center of the Anti-Japanese Democratic Movement. A large number of patriotic intellectual youth, in order to seek the revolutionary truth of anti-Japanese resistance and save the nation from peril, broke through the numerous obstacles and persecutions of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and rushed to Yanan from all over the country to enroll in the Anti-Japanese University. Among them, there were also many overseas Chinese from Vietnam, Indonesia, Burma, Thailand, the Philippines, Singapore, Malaya, Canada, and other countries.

How to educate and transform these patriotic intellectual youth with high enthusiasm and melt them into anti-Japanese revolutionary cadres who are integrated with workers and peasants? This was a new topic facing the Anti-Japanese University.

The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao paid great attention to and cared for the education and cultivation of this group of intellectual youth, giving a series of instructions to the Anti-Japanese University. They instructed the Anti-Japanese University to take political education as the center, strive to transform the students' ideology; instructed the Anti-Japanese University to study while producing, implement the combination of education and productive labor, and make intellectual youth laborized, worker-peasantized, and revolutionized.

Here, there is a display of Chairman Mao's personal inscription for the Anti-Japanese University in April 1939: "The dividing line between intellectuals becoming revolutionary or non-revolutionary, or counter-revolutionary, lies in whether they are willing and actually combine with the workers and peasants, and the dividing line is only this point."

The transcription of Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report "On the Problem of the Communist Party" to the Anti-Japanese University students is displayed in the glass case below Chairman Mao's personal inscription. In the report, Comrade Liu Shaoqi instructed the Anti-Japanese University students to first seriously transform their worldview and combine the transformation of the subjective world with the transformation of the objective world.

A red frame contains the excerpt of the 1939 "Instructions on the Rectification of the Anti-Japanese University" by the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China: "Train intellectual youth into proletarian fighters... train them into cadres of the Eighth Route Army, and strive to transform their thoughts.... Political education is the central link, and class education, party education, and work must be greatly strengthened." The instructions also specifically stipulated four principles for educating and transforming intellectual youth.

Many revolutionary teachers and students who came here to visit carefully read and copied down the instructions of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and Comrade Liu Shaoqi word by word. They said: Chairman Mao's instructions to the Anti-Japanese University are instructions to us.

Many photographs and real objects brought the audience back to the fiery life of the Anti-Japanese University studying while producing at that time. They followed the teachings of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, picked up hoes to dig caves, engaged in production, and put down hoes to study. They regarded labor as the first lesson to enter the Anti-Japanese University.

In a glass case, several hoes, shovels, and rakes are displayed, and in another glass case, a spinning wheel and a spinning tool for twisting wool are displayed. These are the production tools used by the Anti-Japanese University students in the mass production movement at that time.

Chairman Mao's personal inscription for the Anti-Japanese University production movement is hung on the wall: "Now study while producing, and in the future fight while producing, this is the style of the Anti-Japanese University, which is enough to defeat any enemy." Below this inscription, a set of photographs records the scenes of the Anti-Japanese University students vigorously carrying out the production movement at that time: under the Baota Mountain, they were harvesting crops. In just 1939, the entire Anti-Japanese University reclaimed more than 17,800 mu of land and produced more than one million jin of grain. Several other photographs captured the scenes of students making their own straw shoes, cleaning toilets, taking turns as cooks, helping the masses with production labor, and studying during production intervals.

The self-reliant and hardworking spirit of the teachers and students of the Anti-Japanese University not only enabled them to break through various difficulties at that time and develop and grow, but also set a shining example for us to run schools frugally.

Comrade Lin Biao highly evaluated the great significance of Anti-Japanese University students participating in productive labor. He said: "Our school has another main course that is not listed in the curriculum, and the name of this course is called hard struggle." Comrade Lin Biao's instruction is prominently displayed in the middle of the set of photographs reflecting the active participation of Anti-Japanese University students in productive labor. Intellectual youth from the Anti-Japanese University, after being tempered by productive labor, cultivated a hardworking spirit, accelerated ideological transformation, and speeded up the process of integrating with the workers and peasants.

A document "Brief Overview of Various Periods of the Anti-Japanese University" displayed in the glass case shows that in just the fourth and fifth periods, the Anti-Japanese University quickly cultivated more than ten thousand outstanding revolutionary cadres. The Anti-Japanese University was praised by people as a "revolutionary furnace."

The Two Major Teaching Principles of the Anti-Japanese University: Theory and Practice Combined, Few but Excellent

"Combining theory with practice" and "few but excellent," the excerpt from Comrade Lin Biao's speech at the opening ceremony of the second period of the Anti-Japanese University is prominently displayed in the Anti-Japanese University history exhibition hall. These are the teaching principles formulated by Comrade Lin Biao based on the educational policies formulated by Chairman Mao for the Anti-Japanese University. This is a teaching principle that closely combines revolutionary struggle tasks and serves proletarian politics. The Anti-Japanese University completely broke away from bourgeois educational thoughts and systems. The Anti-Japanese University took a completely different path, the path of proletarian revolutionization.

The Anti-Japanese University had a short school system. The teaching content, whether political, military, or cultural, all emphasized Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized class struggle, closely combined with the most urgent problems of the Chinese revolution at that time, and directly served to defeat Japanese imperialism and win the victory of the national revolutionary war.

Here, there is a display of Comrade Lin Biao's personal inscription for the second battalion of the third period of the Anti-Japanese University graduates: "Study the united front, offensive tactics, and revolutionary traditions." This is a summary of the teaching content by Comrade Lin Biao based on the "few but excellent" teaching principle. It is completely in line with the purpose of the Anti-Japanese University in cultivating revolutionary cadres. Each student who mastered these three courses would have the best weapon to defeat the Japanese invaders.

Many photographs introduce the Anti-Japanese University's use of inductive, research-based, and experimental teaching methods in a lively and vivid manner to the audience: teachers giving reports to students, inspiring students' thoughts; students studying documents, studying Chairman Mao's works, and seriously thinking and understanding the spirit; students sitting in a circle for small group meetings, heatedly debating and exchanging learning experiences; participating in actual struggles, further learning and improving in the struggle.

The mass clubs of various teams of the Anti-Japanese University also often held question-and-answer evenings, lectures, debates, discussions, and symposiums, and set up bulletin boards, question-and-answer columns, broadcasting stations, and various exhibitions. This was a good supplement and complement to the regular curriculum. Comrade Dong Biwu once personally presided over a debate on criticizing Trotskyist fallacies at the Anti-Japanese University, which lasted for two weeks and gave the Anti-Japanese University students a great education.

This lively and vivid teaching method of the Anti-Japanese University was highly praised by the broad audience, especially the young students. Many people, while watching, enthusiastically said that the teaching method of the Anti-Japanese University is good, active learning, deep understanding, and practical application, fully mobilizing the students' initiative in learning. This is truly a proletarian revolutionary and combat-ready teaching method. We must learn from it and apply it to our own learning, and thoroughly smash the bourgeois teaching methods.

A continuous stream of people came in batches to visit the Anti-Japanese University history exhibition. They carefully observed each revolutionary relic while seriously copying down many important instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. When they were about to leave, they stopped in front of a red-character inscription by Chairman Mao with excitement and emotion, and read it carefully: "Why is the Anti-Japanese University famous nationwide and has some fame abroad? It is because compared to all anti-Japanese military schools, it is the most revolutionary, the most progressive, and the most able to fight for national liberation and social liberation." This is Chairman Mao's highest evaluation of the Anti-Japanese University. People read Chairman Mao's words, recalling what they saw during the visit, and had an even deeper understanding that the school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools can no longer continue. The glorious tradition of the Anti-Japanese University is to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize politics, use Mao Zedong Thought to guide all work, and arm a wide range of revolutionary cadres with Mao Zedong Thought. The Anti-Japanese University is a shining example of fully implementing and embodying Chairman Mao's brilliant educational thoughts.

    全面贯彻毛主席伟大教育思想的光辉典范
    ——中国人民抗日军事政治大学校史展览巡礼
    三十年前，在革命圣地延安，巍峨的清凉山下，滔滔的延水河旁，一所世界历史上崭新的无产阶级革命化的学校——中国人民抗日军事政治大学（简称抗大）诞生了。在党中央、毛主席的直接领导和关怀下，抗大高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，迅速地成长、壮大，在短短九年里，造就了十多万革命干部，为中国人民的解放事业作出了重大贡献。
    抗大是最全面最生动地贯彻毛主席伟大教育思想的典范。它执行着一整套无产阶级的教育路线、教育方针、教学制度和教学方法，为办成无产阶级革命化的学校树立了光辉榜样。
    八月一日在中国人民革命军事博物馆正式展出的抗大校史展览，通过几百件珍贵的革命文物、图片和资料，对这所最新型、最革命、最进步的学校，作了全面的介绍。今天，人们参观展览，重温抗大校史，仿佛亲身投入了当年抗大的火热斗争生活，受到一次活的毛泽东教育思想的深刻教育，决心以抗大为榜样，发扬无产阶级彻底革命的精神，把一切反动的资产阶级教育思想和教育制度，统统砸得粉碎；把我们国家所有的学校都办成抗大式的无产阶级革命化的学校，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗永远在我国的教育阵地上高高飘扬。
    在党中央、毛主席直接领导和关怀下成长
    抗大，在党中央、毛主席的直接领导下创建；在党中央、毛主席的阳光和雨露下成长。毛主席历次对抗大作的重要指示和教导，保证了抗大沿着无产阶级革命化的道路大步前进。毛主席给抗大的许多亲笔题词和信件，现在都在这里展出。
      “一个军事学校，最重要的问题，是选择校长教员和规定教育方针。”毛主席的这一指示，鲜明夺目地写在展览大厅的最前面。这是把抗大办成无产阶级革命化的学校的最核心问题。为此，毛主席亲自担任抗大教育委员会的主席，并派了他的最亲密的战友之一林彪同志担任抗大的校长兼政治委员。毛主席还亲笔为抗大教职员写了“忠诚党的教育事业”的题词，指示抗大全体教职员，忠心耿耿地把自己的一切献给无产阶级的教育事业。毛主席的这个题词，用金字缀在展览大厅里鲜红的丝绒屏上，更显得光彩夺目。
    在大厅入口处的鲜红丝绒屏上，缀着金字组成的三句话：坚定正确的政治方向，艰苦朴素的工作作风，灵活机动的战略战术。八个字：团结、紧张、严肃、活泼。这是毛主席亲手为抗大制定的教育方针和校风。在玻璃柜里展出的毛主席在一九三九年为抗大成立三周年而写的纪念文章《被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事》的手稿中，再次明确地规定了上述这一教育方针。
    毛主席亲自到抗大讲课，经常给抗大作指示，还深入到学员中间，和学员谈心。我们伟大的领袖毛主席这种平易近人，联系群众的作风，永远是每一个革命者学习的光辉榜样。
    一张张照片，真实地记载了毛主席和党中央其他领导同志当年在抗大讲课、作报告的情况。毛主席的许多重要著作，如《中国革命战争的战略问题》、《实践论》、《矛盾论》，都在抗大作过讲演。刘少奇同志的《论共产党员的修养》也是对抗大学员进行思想教育的基本教材。这里还展出了周恩来、朱德、林彪、邓小平等同志给抗大学员讲话、作报告的原稿或记录稿。
    抗大的学员们，在党中央和毛主席的直接领导和关怀下，迅速以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来。当他们毕业的时候，毛主席又给他们亲笔题词：“勇敢、坚定、沉着。向斗争中学习。为民族解放事业随时准备牺牲自己的一切！”每期学员都牢记着领袖的教导，奔赴抗日前线，深入敌后，和日本侵略者展开英勇卓著的斗争。
    毛主席著作是抗大的基本教材
    在抗大校史展览大厅正中央，一架玻璃柜内，在“把毛主席的书当作指导方向，以毛主席著作作为基本教材”的金字标题下，整整齐齐地陈列着毛主席在第二次国内革命战争时期和抗日战争时期写的《论反对日本帝国主义的策略》、《中国革命战争的战略问题》、《实践论》、《矛盾论》、《论持久战》、《中国革命和中国共产党》、《新民主主义论》、《改造我们的学习》等数十篇光辉著作。这些著作，都是抗大学习的基本教材。学员们直接从毛主席著作中学习政治，学习阶级斗争的理论，学习毛主席天才的哲学思想，学习打败日本帝国主义的人民战争思想和战略战术原则。
    党的抗日民族统一战线的理论和策略，是打败日本帝国主义的一个重要武器，也是肩负着抗日救国重任的抗大学员最重要的课程之一。展出的毛主席在一九三七年为抗大九队的题词中指出：“这救亡二字就是你们及全国人民在现阶段上唯一的总目标。达到这个目标的道路是抗日民族统一战线，希望你们学习这个统一战线的理论与方法，唯有统一战线才能达到救亡的目的。”
    玻璃柜里陈列的毛主席的《论反对日本帝国主义的策略》、《中国共产党在民族战争中的地位》、《统一战线中的独立自主问题》、《战争和战略问题》等著作，是抗大学习统一战线理论的基本教材。毛主席还亲自为学员们讲授抗日民族统一战线的课程。陈列在毛主席为抗大九队亲笔题词旁边的一张照片，记录了当年抗大二期学员在广场上听毛主席作团结抗日问题报告的真实情景。毛主席的抗日民族统一战线的思想武装了抗大的学员，他们深入敌后，在错综复杂的斗争中，始终坚持正确的政治方向，坚持统一战线，坚持党在统一战线中的独立自主原则，紧紧地依靠群众，发动群众，从胜利走向更大的胜利。
    毛主席的伟大的人民战争思想，是抗大学员学习军事的最基本、最重要的课程。这里展出了一本一九三七年油印的《中国革命战争的战略问题》，另有一本盖有抗大三分校公章的《论持久战》和《抗日游击战争的战略问题》的合订本。这两本书的纸色已经发黄，封面有些破损。可以想见，毛主席的这两本著作，不知有多少革命干部阅读过，也不知有多少人从中学到了陷日本帝国主义于汪洋大海的人民战争思想，从而为抗日战争的胜利建立了不朽的功勋。
    在展览大厅里，观众们兴奋地读着刘少奇同志在党的第七次代表大会上代表党中央作《关于修改党章的报告》中的一段话：“现在的重要任务，就是动员全党来学习毛泽东思想，宣传毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想来武装我们的党员和革命的人民，使毛泽东思想变为实际的不可抗御的力量。……一切党校和训练班，必须用毛泽东同志的著作作为基本教材；……”从这里，观众们更加深刻地认识到：我们所有的学校，都必须把毛主席著作作为基本教材，把用毛泽东思想武装学生作为最根本的任务。这样，才能真正地把我们的学校建成为造就无产阶级革命事业接班人的基地。
      阶级斗争——抗大最主要的课程
    按照毛主席的教导，抗大坚决把阶级斗争作为主要的课程，培养、造就无产阶级的革命干部。展览大厅里展出的许多文件、图片、材料，生动地、形象地介绍了抗大学员是怎样学习阶级斗争这门主课的。
    许多照片记述了抗大学员走出校门，参加校外群众性政治活动的情况：他们参加延安群众大会，要求国民党政府停止内战，一致抗日；他们和延安各界一起，愤怒声讨国民党反动派制造分裂，投降日寇的罪行。抗大学员把自己的学习生活，同抗日战争，同群众斗争紧密结合在一起。他们是阶级斗争的亲身参加者，又在阶级斗争的实践中学习这门主课。他们不仅在延安的窑洞里学，而且在烽火连天的抗日战场上学。抗日战场，是抗大学员学习阶级斗争最生动、最有效的大的课堂。正如毛主席所指示的“向斗争中学习”，“从战争学习战争”。
    遵照党中央、毛主席的指示，抗大总校挺进到敌人后方去办学。在“学习战斗在敌后方”的总标题下，一张张当年实地拍下的照片和写下的报道，生动地记下了抗大师生在敌后一面学习、一面作战的情况。一张洪岭战斗示意图和有关洪岭战斗的报道材料，吸引了观众。这是抗大总校师生亲身参加的许多战斗中的一次。一九四○年十月，日寇对我太行山根据地发动了残酷的“扫荡”。抗大总校奉命派出五个连，在晋东南太行山区的洪岭村一带阻击敌人，掩护后方机关和群众安全转移。从清晨战斗到深夜，日寇在飞机、大炮、烟幕的掩护下，连续发动了四次冲锋，都被抗大师生打退了，胜利完成了阻击任务。在实战中，学员们检验了自己学习毛主席军事思想的成果，通过亲身战斗的实践，更进一步加深了对毛主席的军事思想的理解。在洪岭战斗示意图下方的玻璃柜里，陈列着一份份关于洪岭战斗的小结。这些都是学员们在战斗结束以后写出来的，是他们活学活用毛主席军事理论与实际相联系的又一成果。
    在这里展出的不少图片、报道，还介绍了抗大学员组织民运队，参加减租减息斗争；抗大的一部分学员深入正太路日寇占领地区，发动群众，开展敌占区工作；他们有的把热血洒在从日寇手中收复的祖国土地上。
    一份华北版《新华日报》，报道了抗大学员参加内丘袭敌战斗的情况。这则报道说：“抗大参加战斗之学员，咸不辞艰苦，在此战斗中研究经验，并向群众进行宣传。”在火热的阶级斗争的大课堂中，抗大学员把自己锻炼成为立场坚定，方向明确，既能打仗，又会做群众工作的革命干部。
    敬爱的领袖毛主席教导我们：阶级斗争是青年的一门主课，青年应该把坚定正确的政治方向放在第一位。毛主席还指示我们：“无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的。”毛主席的这些教导，是对我国青年的最大关怀和爱护，明确指出了教育革命的核心问题，指出了培养无产阶级革命接班人的根本道路。抗大的学员们，在这条道路上迈开了大步，做出了榜样。
    抗大教育改造知识青年的道路——实行教育与生产劳动相结合
    抗日战争爆发，中国共产党高举抗日民族革命战争的伟大旗帜，成为领导全国人民抗战的核心力量，延安成了抗日民主运动的中心。大批的爱国知识青年，为了寻求抗日的革命真理，挽救中华民族的危亡，冲破国民党反动派的重重阻挠和迫害，从全国各地纷纷来到延安，投考抗大。其中还有不少是来自越南、印尼、缅甸、泰国、菲律宾、新加坡、马来亚、加拿大等地的爱国侨胞。
    怎样教育改造这些爱国热情高涨的知识青年，把他们熔炼成为工农化的抗日革命干部？这是摆在抗大面前的一个新课题。
    党中央、毛主席十分重视和关怀着对这群知识青年的教育和培养，对抗大作了一系列的指示。指示抗大以政治教育为中心，努力改造学生的思想；指示抗大一面学习，一面生产，实行教育与生产劳动相结合，使知识青年劳动化、工农化、革命化。
    这里陈列着毛主席在一九三九年四月为抗大题词的手迹：“知识分子之成为革命的或不革命的，或反革命的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行结合工农民众，他们的分界仅仅在这一点。”
    刘少奇同志给抗大学员作《共产党问题》报告的记录稿，陈列在毛主席这个亲笔题词下方的玻璃柜中。刘少奇同志在报告中，指示抗大学员首先要认真改造自己的世界观，并且把改造主观世界与改造客观世界结合起来。
    一块鲜红的镜框里，镶着一九三九年中共中央军委《关于整理抗大问题的指示》的节录：“把知识青年训练成为无产阶级的战士……，训练成为八路军的干部，应努力转变他们的思想，……政治教育是中心一环，阶级教育、党的教育与工作必须大大加强。”指示中还具体规定了教育改造知识青年的四条原则。
    来这里参观的许多革命师生，一字一句地认真默读着党中央、毛主席和刘少奇同志的这些指示，并把它抄在小本上。他们说：毛主席对抗大的指示，就是对我们的指示。
    许多图片和实物，又把观众带到了当年抗大一面学习一面生产的火热生活中。他们遵照党中央、毛主席的教导，拿起锄头挖窑洞，搞生产，放下锄头就学习。他们把劳动当作是进抗大的第一课。
    一架玻璃柜中，展出了几把镢头、铁铲、铁耙等农具，另一架玻璃柜中展出有一架纺线车、捻毛线用的吊拨等。这些都是当年抗大学员在大生产运动中使用过的生产工具。
    毛主席为抗大生产运动的亲笔题词挂在墙上：“现在一面学习，一面生产，将来一面作战，一面生产，这就是抗大的作风，足以战胜任何敌人的”。在这条题词下陈列的一组照片，记下了当年抗大学员轰轰烈烈地开展生产运动的情景：宝塔山下，他们在收割庄稼。仅一九三九年这一年，抗大全校就开荒一万七千八百多亩，生产粮食一百多万斤。另外几幅照片摄下了学员们在自己打草鞋，打扫厕所；轮流下厨当炊事员；帮助群众生产劳动；在生产间隙进行学习。
    抗大师生自力更生、艰苦奋斗的精神，不仅使他们得以冲破当时的种种困难而向前发展、成长，而且也为我们树立了一个勤俭办校的光辉榜样。
    林彪同志高度评价抗大学员参加生产劳动的伟大意义。他说：“我们学校还有一个没有列入课目表的主要课目，这个课目的名称叫做艰苦奋斗。”林彪同志的这个指示，鲜明夺目地写在反映抗大学员积极参加生产劳动的那组照片中间。知识青年出身的抗大学员们，经过生产劳动的锻炼，培养了艰苦奋斗的作风，加速了思想改造，加快了同工农群众相结合的进程。
    玻璃柜中展出的一份“抗大总校各期简况”表明，仅仅第四、第五两期，抗大就把一万多名知识青年，迅速培养成为优秀的革命干部。抗大，被人们誉为“革命的熔炉”。
    抗大的两大教学原则——理论与实际联系，少而精
    “理论与实际联系”，“少而精”，当年抗大校长林彪同志在抗大二期开学典礼上的讲话节录，醒目地写在抗大校史展览大厅里。这是林彪同志根据毛主席为抗大制定的教育方针而规定的教学原则。这是一个密切结合革命斗争任务，为无产阶级政治服务的教学原则。抗大，彻底破除了资产阶级的教育思想和教育制度。抗大走的完全是自己的道路，无产阶级革命化的道路。
    抗大的学制短。教学内容，无论是政治、军事和文化，都是突出毛泽东思想，突出阶级斗争，紧密联系当时中国革命最迫切的问题，直接为打败日本帝国主义，为争取民族革命战争的胜利服务。
    这里展出了林彪同志为抗大三期二大队毕业学员的亲笔题词：“学习统一战线、进攻战法、革命传统”。这是林彪同志根据“少而精”的教学原则概括的教学内容。它完全符合抗大培养革命干部的办校目的。每个学员学好了这三门课，就掌握了打败日本侵略者的最好武器。
    展出的许多图片，把抗大采用启发式、研究式、实验式的生动活泼的教学方法，形象化地给观众作了全面的介绍：教员在给学员作报告，启发学员的思想；学员们在自学文件，学习毛主席著作，认真思考、领会精神实质；学员们围坐在一起开小组会，热烈地展开辩论，交流学习心得体会；参加实际斗争，在斗争中进一步学习提高。
    抗大各队的群众性俱乐部，也经常召开问答晚会、讲演会、辩论会、讨论会和座谈会，并设立了墙报栏、问答栏、广播台和各种展览。这是对正课学习的很好配合和补充。董必武同志曾经亲自在抗大主持召集了批判托派谬论的辩论会，连续进行了两个星期，给了抗大学员很大的教育。
    抗大这种生动活泼的教学方法，受到广大观众，特别是青年学生的热烈赞扬。不少人一面观看，一面兴高采烈地说，抗大的教学方法就是好，学得活，领会深，用得上，充分发挥了学生的学习主动性。这才是真正无产阶级革命化、战斗化的教学方法，我们一定要把它学过来，用到自己的学习中去，把资产阶级的教学方法，彻底砸烂、捣碎。
    川流不息的人群，一批批前来参观抗大校史展览。他们一面仔细观看一件件革命文物，一面认真抄录着党中央、毛主席的许多重要指示。当他们将要离开的时候，又怀着兴奋和激动的心情，在一条用红字写成的毛主席语录前停留下来，认真地读了起来：“抗大为什么全国闻名，在国外也有点名气？就是因为它同所有的抗日军事学校比较起来，是最革命、最进步的，最能为民族解放和社会解放而斗争。”这是毛主席对抗大最高的评价。人们读着毛主席的这段话，回忆着参观时看到的一切，愈加深刻认识到，学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。抗大的光荣传统，最核心的就是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，用毛泽东思想指导一切工作，用毛泽东思想武装广大革命干部。抗大，是全面贯彻和体现毛主席光辉教育思想的典范。　　　本报记者
