	Study Politics and Culture Together
	By combining the study of Chairman Mao's works with learning culture, by combining the transformation of one's thoughts with learning culture, one can learn actively, apply actively, learn quickly, and remember firmly.

	Five Good Soldier  Zhu Yushen of a Certain Unit of the PLA

	I enlisted in March of last year. My family has been poor farmers for generations, and I have a deep class sentiment for the Party and Chairman Mao. As soon as I enlisted, I resolved to read Chairman Mao's books. However, since I couldn't read, it was very difficult to learn. Thus, I made up my mind to learn culture. How to learn? At this time, the political instructor knew my thoughts and said to me, "You should study Chairman Mao's works to learn culture, and study culture to deepen your understanding of Mao Zedong Thought." Following the political instructor's advice, I first studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune." I asked others to help me with each word and sentence. In this way, I studied for two months, but I still forgot what I had learned earlier. The character "毫" in "selflessly helping others" took me six or seven times to remember. One day during a rest from labor, I asked the squad leader, "Why do I keep forgetting what I've learned?" The squad leader said, "Studying Chairman Mao's works and learning culture, you can't just memorize words. You should link it to your thoughts and daily work. For example, today when digging, there are good and bad shovels. If you let others use the good ones and you use the bad ones, linking this to studying 'selflessly helping others' will help you remember it." Another time, I studied the four characters "完全" and "彻底." To remember them, I took a day off on Sunday to help the workers pulling flatbed carts push the cart to the quarry near the barracks to hammer stones. Although I was sweating all over, I felt I had a good harvest. Because of raising my consciousness through practice, and through practice, I also remembered the four characters "完全" and "彻底" that I had learned.

	Under the help of the leadership and comrades, I can now read both volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong (Type A)."

	Recently, the regiment selected me as an active learner of Chairman Mao's works and introduced my experience to the entire regiment. I am very excited. If it weren't for the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought and this big school of the army, I would never have made these progress. In the future, I will study Chairman Mao's works and culture even harder to become the master of culture.

    学政治带文化
    结合学习毛主席著作学文化，结合改造思想学文化，学得活，用得活，学得快，记得牢。
    解放军某部五好战士  朱玉臣
    我是去年三月入伍的。我家祖祖辈辈是贫苦农民，对党和毛主席有特别深厚的阶级感情。一入伍，我就立志要读毛主席的书。可是自己不识字，学起来很困难。于是，我下定决心学文化。怎么学呢？这时指导员知道了我的心思，就跟我说：“要通过学习毛主席著作来学文化，通过学文化来加深对毛泽东思想的理解。”我按照指导员的话，就先学《纪念白求恩》，我一字一句地请教别人。这样学了两个月，还是学了后边忘了前边。“毫不利己专门利人”的“毫”字，一连学了六、七遍也记不住。一天劳动休息的时候，我问班长：“怎么学了老是记不住呢？”班长说：“学习毛主席著作和学习文化，不能老啃字，要联系自己的思想和日常工作。譬如，今天挖土，有好锹和孬锹，如果把好的让给别人，自己用孬的，联系这件事来学习‘毫不利己专门利人’，就记得牢了。”又一次，我学习“完全”、“彻底”四个字，为了记得牢，星期天就请假去帮拉平板车的工人推车，到营房附近的采石厂去打锤，尽管累得全身是汗，但我觉得收获不小。由于在实践中提高了觉悟，经过实践，就把认识了的“完全”、“彻底”四个字也记牢了。我在领导和同志们的帮助下，现在已经能阅读《毛泽东著作选读》（甲种本）上、下册了。
    最近，团里选我为学习毛主席著作积极分子，并向全团介绍经验。我心里很激动，如果没有毛泽东思想的哺育，没有部队这个大学校，我是无论如何也不会有这些进步的。今后我要更加努力学习毛主席著作，学习文化，做文化的主人。
