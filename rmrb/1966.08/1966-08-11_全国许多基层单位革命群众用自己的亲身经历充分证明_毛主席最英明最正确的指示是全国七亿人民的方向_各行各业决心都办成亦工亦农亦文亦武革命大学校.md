Many grassroots units across the nation have used their personal experiences to fully prove that Chairman Mao's most brilliant and correct instructions are the direction for the nation's 700 million people. Various industries have resolved to turn themselves into revolutionary schools that are both industrial and agricultural, both cultural and military.

Xinhua News Agency, August 9th: "Transform Chairman Mao's great instructions into the actual actions of the nation's people immediately!" Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao's call to turn every industry into a revolutionary school that is both industrial and agricultural, both cultural and military, has reached every corner of the nation. People unanimously express their resolve to do so.

In recent days, party organizations in many places have made it their top priority to seriously study and widely propagate Chairman Mao's great call. Party committees at all levels in Jiangsu Province have recently held meetings to seriously study and discuss Chairman Mao's great call, summarize experiences, actively plan, take revolutionary measures, and make the greatest resolve to gradually turn every industry into a revolutionary school. During the discussions, the party committees realized that to thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's instruction, fundamental reforms must be made in every aspect, from people's thoughts to organizational structures and systems. This is a great revolution that touches the depths of people's souls and will inevitably encounter resistance from all old thoughts, old habits, and old traditions. This is a serious, sharp, and complex class struggle and a struggle between two lines. Therefore, to thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's instruction, we must first take class struggle and the struggle between two lines as the key, carry out the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end, carry out the socialist education movement in urban and rural areas to the end, mobilize the masses to make a revolution, and replace the old capitalist ways with new socialist and communist ones.

Leaders of various fronts such as industry, transportation, and construction in Zhejiang Province have also made it their top priority to study and propagate Chairman Mao's great instructions. The party committees or political departments of cities such as Hangzhou, Ningbo, and Wenzhou have held meetings with leaders of grassroots units. They first seriously study themselves and then propagate and explain to the workers in their industries and units.

Recently, party committees at all levels in the Jin Dongnan region of Shanxi Province have organized a large propaganda team to go deep into rural people's communes, production teams, factories, schools, and government agencies, and widely propagate Chairman Mao's instructions to workers, peasants, cadres, and students. The Jin Dongnan Regional Party Committee also requires all units to be turned into schools of Mao Zedong Thought.

Party committees in provinces and autonomous regions such as Hunan and Tibet have issued notices to their subordinate party organizations at all levels, requiring them to quickly arm the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary intellectuals, and Communist Party members with Chairman Mao's instructions, and actively take action according to Chairman Mao's instructions, walk the path of revolutionization, and turn their provinces and regions into revolutionary schools.

Many grassroots units' workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals have used their personal experiences to prove that Chairman Mao's instructions are the most brilliant and correct, and that Chairman Mao's instructions are the direction for the nation's 700 million people. They have expressed their resolve to continue to advance bravely along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao.

Teachers and students of Fujian Mechanical and Electrical School have explained through their personal experiences that as long as the school is run according to Chairman Mao's instructions, the school will be full of vitality, and the students trained will meet the needs of socialist revolution and construction, in line with Chairman Mao's requirement to "train laborers who are both socially conscious and cultured." In 1958, they turned the school's practice factory into a production factory, with cadres and teachers taking turns to work in the factory, and students also arranging half of their time to work in the workshop. This year, they also designated three classes in the foundry major as pilot classes for comprehensive half-work, half-study. This directly impacted the bourgeois educational ideas and order, bringing a revolutionary new atmosphere. Teaching combined with labor production has gradually cultivated a sense of class and excellent qualities of the working class among teachers and students, realizing the proletarianization of intellectuals. After teachers participated in labor, they overcame the phenomenon of theory being detached from practice, improving teaching quality. Students used both their brains and hands, cultivating a generation of new people who combine mental and physical labor. This shows that firmly executing Chairman Mao's instructions is the most fundamental measure to ensure that our party and state will never change color. The Mechanical and Electrical School is also an advanced unit of the militia. When talking about this aspect, Lu Changxian, the platoon leader of the armed guard company, said, "We are determined to hold a pen in one hand and a gun in the other, temper our red thoughts and harden our skills, and build an iron wall of revolution with the hundreds of millions of workers and peasants." The teachers and students enthusiastically support Chairman Mao's instruction that "the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools can no longer continue." The entire school's teachers and students expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, further deepen the educational revolution, and truly turn the Mechanical and Electrical School into an advanced, revolutionary, and progressive school in the style of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, and into a school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Revolutionary teachers and students of Yunnan Labor University pointed out that their practice over the past year has proven the unparalleled brilliance and greatness of Chairman Mao's call. Over the past year, the students of this school have not only studied literature but also learned industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and learned to do mass work. Currently, revolutionary teachers and students are using the pen to criticize the bourgeoisie. When this school was established in September last year, except for a few rooms in a few departments, most departments did not have classrooms. Teachers and students studied Mao Zedong's "On Contradiction," "On Practice," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought. Last winter, they taught classes outdoors while overcoming various difficulties, building many rooms by themselves, and installing electric lights. In teaching, they took the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University as an example, emphasizing that education serves proletarian politics, that education is combined with productive labor, and that students are cultivated into new people who love the Party and love labor.

Workers of Kunming Phosphorus Fertilizer Plant, who have initially implemented the system of being both industrial and agricultural, enthusiastically support Chairman Mao's call and express their determination to continue to advance along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao. Since the end of 1964, this factory has begun to trial the system of rotating workers between industry and agriculture. Currently, workers who are both industrial and agricultural account for 24% of the total number of workers in the factory. At the beginning of this year, the factory further trialed a combination of factory and commune under unified leadership. The factory regards doing a good job in agriculture as one of its important tasks, organizing and helping commune members to study Chairman Mao's works, and taking many measures to narrow the gap between workers and peasants and between urban and rural areas. Although the time is not long, many good changes have already taken place in the factory and the countryside. This factory is located in a rural area, and the phosphorus fertilizer it produces directly serves agriculture. However, in the past, it operated in isolation, severely alienating itself from the peasants. After studying Chairman Mao's relevant instructions and the Daqing experience, the factory leadership realized that they must firmly take the path of combining industry and agriculture, urban and rural areas, and truly regard doing a good job in agriculture as the factory's responsibility. Currently, all workers in the factory are further seriously studying Chairman Mao's instructions and have made new plans according to Chairman Mao's instructions, determined to turn the factory and the commune into schools of Mao Zedong Thought that are both industrial and agricultural, both cultural and military.

More than 200 workers of various ethnic groups in the Xingjiang Hetian Silk Factory, who are both industrial and agricultural, feel particularly close to Chairman Mao's instructions. They excitedly said: Over the past year, we usually work in the factory and return to the production team or work in the nearby countryside during the busy farming season; in the factory, we also participated in the study of Chairman Mao's works and militia training. Now we can hold a hoe to farm, stand by the machine to weave silk, hold a gun to fight, and hold a pen to criticize the bourgeoisie. We will definitely listen to the Party and Chairman Mao and firmly implement Chairman Mao's new instructions, persist in the system of being both industrial and agricultural, and temper ourselves into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Workers of Qinghai Wool Textile Factory, who are advancing on the path of being both industrial and agricultural, enthusiastically acclaim Chairman Mao's great call as a guiding light and a program of action. Since 1964, this factory has taken the People's Liberation Army as an example, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and while working, reclaimed land, farmed, and trained in military affairs. Now they have farmed 100 mu of land and planted more than 7,000 trees, and their militia training results are also good. Workers have expressed their determination to hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, temper themselves into new people with high political consciousness and comprehensive development.

In September 1958, when Chairman Mao inspected the Wuhan Steel and Iron Company, he instructed the workers of Wuhan Steel and Iron Company: "You have such a large enterprise and should do a bit of chemical industry, a bit of mechanical industry, a bit of building materials industry, and a bit of all kinds of industries, turning it into a combined enterprise." He also instructed: "Such a large enterprise should have industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs." This time, Chairman Mao's new instructions have come, and the workers feel particularly close to them. They joyfully held a symposium. Everyone reviewed the situation of implementing Chairman Mao's instructions over the past few years and believed that to do a good job in turning various industries into revolutionary schools that are both industrial and agricultural, both cultural and military, one must always hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought. They said that by doing according to Chairman Mao's instructions, one can promote people to break with all the old thoughts, old culture, old customs, and old habits left over from old society, and can promote the gradual narrowing of the gaps between workers and peasants, between urban and rural areas, and between mental and physical labor, making people become new people with high political consciousness and comprehensive development. Workers said that over the past few years, we have remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, established many citizen militia divisions, and 90% of the workers have joined the militia organization. Once imperialism invades us, we will teach them to come and go no more. We have also established many part-time schools and half-work, half-study schools. However, we did not deeply understand the great significance of Chairman Mao's instructions in the past, and the implementation of Chairman Mao's instructions was not enough. Workers who participated in the symposium reviewed the gap with Daqing Oilfield. They said that Chairman Mao's brilliant and brilliant instructions have been vividly manifested in the People's Liberation Army and in Daqing Oilfield. They did well because they always read Chairman Mao's books, listened to Chairman Mao's words, and did according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Workers of Wuhan Steel and Iron Company will definitely firmly implement Chairman Mao's instructions in the future, take the People's Liberation Army and Daqing Oilfield as examples, turn Wuhan Steel and Iron Company into a school of Mao Zedong Thought, and stride forward towards the revolutionary direction of being both industrial and agricultural, both cultural and military.

Some workers of Tianjin Changlu Dagang Salt Field, who went to Daqing for learning, talked about the great role of the factory's engagement in agricultural and sideline production in promoting the thought revolutionization of workers and their families when comparing with Chairman Mao's instructions, saying that the factory's engagement in agricultural and sideline production is not just a matter of farming a few mu of land, but a major measure with far-reaching significance to promote people's thought revolutionization and gradually narrow the gaps between urban and rural areas and between workers and peasants. The factory implements the system of being both industrial and agricultural, peasants enter the factory to work, and workers go to the fields to farm, which can communicate the feelings of workers and peasants and become strong revolutionary warriors nurtured under Mao Zedong Thought to carry out socialist revolution and socialist construction together. They have reduced the number of permanent workers in the salt field through learning the Daqing experience and according to Chairman Mao's instructions of being both industrial and agricultural, and recruited more than 1,500 seasonal workers who return to the countryside to be commune members during the busy farming season this year. The salt field also organized workers' families to reclaimed tens of mu of wasteland. This salt field is located in Bohai Bay, and they have also established a citizen militia division according to Chairman Mao's people's war thought, undertaking the task of defending the coastal defense. Recently, the salt field party committee further studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, decided to expand the scope of being both industrial and agricultural according to the conditions of the salt field, not only families farm, but also salt field workers farm, determined to mobilize all workers in the salt field to strive to study and implement Chairman Mao's great instructions, and turn the salt field into a revolutionary school that is both industrial and agricultural, both cultural and military.

The "August 1st" Sugar Factory of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps has recruited a batch of farmers and herdsmen from the nearby commune as contract workers. With the help of sugar-making workers, these contract workers have initially mastered the sugar-making operation technology.

　　全国许多基层单位革命群众用自己的亲身经历充分证明
　　毛主席最英明最正确的指示是全国七亿人民的方向
　　各行各业决心都办成亦工亦农亦文亦武革命大学校
    新华社九日讯　“把毛主席的伟大指示迅速变成全国人民的实际行动！”我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席关于把各行各业都办成亦工亦农、亦文亦武的革命化大学校的伟大号召传到全国各地，人们一致表示了这样的决心。
    这几天，许多地方的党组织都把认真学习和向人民群众广泛宣传毛主席的这一伟大号召，作为当前最突出的任务。江苏省、地、市、县各级党委，最近正纷纷举行会议，认真学习和讨论毛主席的这一伟大号召，并总结经验，积极着手规划，采取革命措施，下最大决心把各行各业都逐步办成革命化的大学校。各级党委在讨论中体会到，认真贯彻毛主席的这个指示，从人的思想到机关体制、制度等各个方面都要进行一系列的根本改革，这是一场大革命，它触及到人们的灵魂深处，必然要遇到一切旧思想、旧习惯、旧传统的抵抗。这是一场严重的、尖锐的、复杂的阶级斗争和两条道路斗争。因此，要坚决贯彻毛主席这一指示，首先必须以阶级斗争、两条道路斗争为纲，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把城乡社会主义教育运动进行到底，放手发动群众闹革命，破资本主义之旧，立社会主义、共产主义之新。
    浙江全省工业、交通、基建各条战线的领导干部，也把学习和宣传毛主席的伟大指示当作当前最突出的任务。杭州、宁波、温州等市的市委或市委工交政治部，分别召开基层单位的领导干部会议。他们首先自己认真学习，然后向本行业、本单位职工宣传讲解。
      山西省晋东南地区的各级党委最近组织了一支庞大的宣传队伍深入农村人民公社生产队、工厂、学校、机关等单位，向工人、农民、干部和师生，广泛宣传毛主席的这一指示。中共晋东南地委还要求各地把所有单位办成毛泽东思想大学校。
    湖南、西藏等省、自治区党委分别向所属各级党组织发出通知，要求迅速用毛主席的这一指示把广大工农兵、革命干部、革命知识分子和共产党员们武装起来，并且积极行动起来，按毛主席的指示办事，走革命化的道路，把本省、区办成革命化的大学校。
    许多基层单位的工农兵群众、革命干部和革命知识分子用自己的亲身经历证明，毛主席的这一指示最英明、最正确，毛主席的这一指示，就是全国七亿人民的方向。他们表示要坚定不移地继续沿着毛主席指引的这一方向奋勇前进。
    福建机电学校师生用切身体会说明：只要按毛主席的指示办学校，学校就生气勃勃，培养的学生就能适应社会主义革命和建设的需要，符合毛主席提出的
  “培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”的要求。一九五八年他们把学校的实习工厂改为生产工厂，干部、教员轮流下厂劳动，学生也安排一半时间到车间劳动。今年还确定铸造专业三个班为全面进行半工半读的试点班。这样就直接冲击了资产阶级的教育思想和教育秩序，带来了革命新气象。教学与劳动生产相结合，使师生逐渐培养起工人阶级的阶级感情和优秀品质，实现了知识分子劳动化。教师参加劳动后，克服了过去理论脱离实际的现象，提高了教学质量。学生动脑又动手，培养了大批脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合的一代新人。这说明，坚决执行毛主席的指示，是保证我们党和国家永不变色的最根本的措施。机电学校还是一个民兵先进单位。谈到这方面的体会时，武装警卫连连长卢昌贤说，我们决心一手拿笔杆子，一手拿枪杆子，炼红思想，炼硬本领，和亿万工农兵群众一道筑起革命的铜墙铁壁。师生们对于毛主席指示的“资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了”表示热烈拥护。全校师生表示一定要遵照毛主席的教导，进一步深入开展教育革命，把机电学校真正办成抗大式的最新型、最革命、最进步的学校，办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    云南劳动大学的革命师生指出，他们一年来的实践，证明了毛主席这一号召的无比英明和伟大。一年来这所学校的学生们不但学了文，而且学了工、农、军，学会了做群众工作。目前，革命师生们正在用笔杆子批判资产阶级。去年九月这所学校成立时，除了个别系有少数房屋外，大多数的系都没有校舍。师生们学习了毛主席的《矛盾论》、《实践论》、《愚公移山》等文章，用毛泽东思想武装了自己的头脑。去冬他们一面在露天上课，一面克服种种困难，自己动手盖起了不少的房子，还安装了电灯。在教学上也以抗大为榜样，强调教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合，强调把学生培养成热爱党、热爱劳动的共产主义新人。
    初步实行了亦工亦农的昆明磷肥厂职工热烈拥护毛主席的号召，并且表示要沿着毛主席指引的方向继续前进。这个厂从一九六四年底开始试行亦工亦农的轮换工制度，现有亦工亦农的工人已占全厂职工总数的百分之二十四。今年初工厂又进一步和附近的人民公社试行厂社结合，统一领导。工厂把办好农业当成自己的重要任务，组织和帮助社员学习毛主席著作，并采取许多措施来缩小工农之间与城乡之间的差别。虽然时间还不长，但已使工厂和农村都发生了许多好的变化。这个工厂办在农村，生产的磷肥直接为农业服务，但是过去关门办厂，在许多方面严重地脱离农民。经过学习毛主席的有关指示和大庆经验，工厂领导才认识到要坚决走工农结合、城乡结合的道路，真正把办好农业作为工厂的责任。目前，全厂职工正在进一步认真学习毛主席的指示，并按照毛主席的指示做出了新的规划，决心把厂和社都办成亦工亦农、亦文亦武的毛泽东思想大学校。
    新疆和田丝绸厂二百多名亦工亦农的各族工人，对毛主席的指示格外感到亲切。她们兴奋地说：一年多以来，我们平时在工厂生产，农忙时回到生产队，或到工厂附近农村劳动；在厂里我们还参加了毛主席著作学习和民兵训练，现在我们已经拿起坎土镘能种地，站到机器旁能织丝绸。拿起枪杆能打仗；拿起笔杆能批判资产阶级。我们一定听党和毛主席的话，坚决贯彻执行毛主席这一新的指示，把亦工亦农制度坚持下去，锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    正在亦工亦农大道上迈进的青海毛纺织厂职工，热烈欢呼毛主席的伟大号召是指路明灯，是行动纲领。这个厂一九六四年以来就以解放军为榜样，活学活用毛主席著作，在做工的同时开荒、种田、练武，现在已种田一百亩，栽树七千多株，民兵训练成绩也很好。职工们纷纷表示要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把自己锻炼成有高度政治觉悟的、全面发展的共产主义新人。
    毛主席在一九五八年九月十三日视察武汉钢铁公司时指示武钢职工：“你们这样大的企业，应该办点化学工业，办点机械工业，办点建筑材料工业，各种工业都办点，办成联合企业。”他还指示：“这样大的企业，应该工农商学兵都有。”这次毛主席的新的指示传来，职工们感到特别亲切，他们欢欣鼓舞地举行了座谈。大家在座谈中回顾了武钢这几年执行毛主席指示的情况，认为要办好亦工亦农、亦文亦武的革命化大学校，必须时时处处高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。他们说，按照毛主席的指示去做，就可以促进人们同旧社会遗留下来的一切旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯决裂，可以促进逐步缩小工农差别、城乡差别、体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别，使人们成为有高度政治觉悟的、全面发展的共产主义新人。职工们说，这几年，我们牢记毛主席的教导，大办民兵师，百分之九十的职工参加了民兵组织。一旦帝国主义侵略我们，管教他有来无回。我们也办了许多业余学校和半工半读学校。但是，以前我们对毛主席指示的伟大意义领会不深，执行毛主席的指示还很不够。参加座谈的武钢职工检查了同大庆油田的差距。他们说，毛主席伟大的光辉的指示，在解放军、在大庆油田，都生动地体现出来了。他们做得好，是因为他们时时刻刻读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。武钢职工今后一定要坚决执行毛主席的指示，以解放军和大庆油田为榜样，把武钢办成为毛泽东思想的大学校，向亦工亦农、亦文亦武的革命化方向阔步前进。
    天津长芦塘沽盐场一部分到大庆学习的职工，对照毛主席的指示，谈到大庆油田从事农副业生产对于促进职工和家属思想革命化所起的重大作用时说，工厂从事农副业生产不单是种几亩地的问题，而是促进人的思想革命化和逐步缩小城乡差别、工农差别的具有深远意义的重大措施。工厂实行亦工亦农，农民进工厂做工，工人下地种田，就能沟通工农群众的感情，可以共同在毛泽东思想哺育下，成为进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的坚强的革命战士。他们通过学习大庆经验，按照毛主席提出的亦工亦农指示，已经减少了盐场的固定工，在今年招收了一千五百多名农忙时回农村当社员的季节工。盐场还组织职工家属开垦了几十亩荒地。这个盐场地处渤海湾，他们还根据毛主席的人民战争思想，大办民兵师，承担起了保卫海防的任务。最近，盐场党委进一步学习了毛主席的最新指示，根据盐场的条件，决定扩大亦工亦农的范围，不但家属种地，盐场的职工也种地，决心发动全场职工努力学习贯彻毛主席的这一伟大指示，把盐场办成亦工亦农、亦文亦武的革命化大学校。（附图片）
