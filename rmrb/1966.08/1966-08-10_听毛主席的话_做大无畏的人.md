On the evening of August 8, I heard the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution on the radio, and I was deeply moved. The wise decision of the Party Central Committee made me deeply feel the greatness of Mao Zedong Thought.

The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao always point out a clear direction for the revolutionary masses at every critical moment of the revolution. The decision of the Central Committee is like a guiding light, illuminating the path of the Cultural Revolution and the hearts of the young revolutionary fighters who are growing in the struggle. The high evaluation of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao on the revolutionary spirit of us young people makes my heart unable to calm down for a long time, and there are so many words in my heart that I want to tell the Party and Chairman Mao.

Dear Chairman Mao, it is you who gave me the revolutionary weapons and strength, making me dare to fight against the anti-Party and anti-socialist gang of four. At the beginning of the movement, I could not distinguish between friends and enemies, and I did not dare to write big-character posters. It was not "dare" that came first, but "fear." I thought, criticizing the gang of four led by Deng Tuo, I am not afraid, and he does not know which school I am from or what my name is. But exposing the problems of the school leadership, I am afraid of retaliation. What should I do? With this question in mind, I studied the works of Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao said: "All erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, all monsters and demons, must be subjected to criticism and cannot be allowed to spread freely." I will act according to Chairman Mao's words and expose and criticize all that does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought. But as soon as I picked up the pen to write a big-character poster, the fear came back: Will they retaliate against me after the movement? Will they give me a bad evaluation in the future? Will they expel me? Let someone else take the lead! Sometimes I wanted to write, sometimes I was afraid, and my mind was in a mess. At this time, I studied Chairman Mao's teachings again: "Be prepared to be skinned alive, dare to pull the emperor off his horse." I thought, we are the successors of the revolution, for communism, we should have the spirit of fearing neither heaven nor earth. I decided to firmly listen to Chairman Mao's words. In this way, I made up my mind and wrote the first big-character poster exposing the problems of the school leadership.

I drew courage and strength from the works of Chairman Mao to fight against the enemy. From then on, I studied Chairman Mao's works every day, using Chairman Mao's words as weapons, and wrote more than forty big-character posters, exposing and criticizing the problems of the school leadership that went against the educational policies of Mao Zedong Thought.

More than two months of struggle made me deeply realize the greatness of Mao Zedong Thought and its boundless power. Whoever masters Mao Zedong Thought can be fearless; whoever masters Mao Zedong Thought can defeat all monsters and demons.

The decision of the Party Central Committee pointed out the direction of our struggle. I am determined, in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to firmly listen to Chairman Mao's words and be a faithful good son of the Party.

Dear Party, dear Chairman Mao, rest assured, we will not disappoint your expectations of us young people. We will definitely dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to make revolution, and dare to fight in this great storm of class struggle, and resolutely overthrow all monsters and demons.

Long live the Communist Party of China!

Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years!

    听毛主席的话　做大无畏的人
    八月八日晚上，我从广播里听了中共中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定，心里非常激动。党中央的这一英明决定，使我更深刻地体会到毛泽东思想的伟大。
    党中央和毛主席总是在每个革命的关键时刻给革命群众指出明确的方向。中央的决定就象指路明灯一样，照亮了文化大革命的道路，照亮了我们正在斗争中成长的革命小将的心。党中央和毛主席对我们青少年的革命精神，给予这样高的评价，使我的心久久不能平静，心里不知有多少话要向党和毛主席讲。
    敬爱的毛主席，是您给了我革命的武器和力量，使我敢于向反党反社会主义的黑帮作斗争。运动刚开始，我分不清敌我，也不敢写大字报，不是“敢”字当头，而是“怕”字当先。我想，批判邓拓一伙黑帮，我不怕，他也不知道我是那个学校的，叫什么名字。可是，揭发学校领导的问题，我害怕打击报复。怎么办？我带着这个问题学习了毛主席著作。毛主席说：“凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。”我要照毛主席的话办事，凡是不符合毛泽东思想的，都要进行揭发批判。可是，刚拿起笔来写大字报，怕字又上来了：运动完了他们会不会打击我？以后会不会给我写坏的评语？他们会不会开除我？还是叫别人打头炮吧！一会儿想写，一会儿又怕，心里乱得很。这时，我又学习了毛主席的教导：“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”。我想，我们是革命接班人，为了共产主义，应该有天不怕地不怕的精神，我要坚决听毛主席的话。就这样，我下定决心写出了揭发学校领导问题的第一张大字报。
    我从毛主席著作中吸取了对敌斗争的勇气和力量，打这以后，我就天天学习毛主席著作，用毛主席的话作为武器，写出了四十多张大字报，揭发批判学校领导违背毛泽东思想的教育方针的问题。
    两个多月的斗争经验，使我更深地认识到毛泽东思想的伟大，毛泽东思想威力无穷。谁掌握了毛泽东思想，谁就能无所畏惧；谁掌握了毛泽东思想，谁就能够战胜一切牛鬼蛇神。
    党中央的决定给我们指明了斗争方向，我决心在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，坚决听毛主席的话，做党的忠实的好儿子。
    敬爱的党，敬爱的毛主席，放心吧，我们决不辜负您对我们青少年的期望，我们一定要在这场阶级斗争的大风大浪中，敢想、敢说、敢闯、敢革命、敢斗争，坚决斗垮一切牛鬼蛇神。
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！
