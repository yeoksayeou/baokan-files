From the northern border city to Hainan Island, from the front lines of the East China Sea to the Pamir border, people of all nationalities—broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres—are full of spirit and joyously shout: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!" The revolutionary songs "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" and the sounds of drums, gongs, and firecrackers fill the sky.

In this most joyous moment, how many people have tears of joy, and how many hearts fly towards the capital. Revolutionary masses of all nationalities spread the joyous news to each other, encouraging each other. They say: Chairman Mao's heart is close to the hearts of the revolutionary masses. Even if we shout "Long live Chairman Mao!" a million times, ten million times, it is still not enough to express our love and gratitude for Chairman Mao. The words of all nationalities' revolutionary masses express a common voice: Chairman Mao is holding the hands of the capital's revolutionary masses, and he is stirring the hearts of hundreds of millions of people nationwide. Although we do not live in the capital, we are fighting shoulder to shoulder with the capital's revolutionary masses in the Cultural Revolution. Chairman Mao meeting with the capital's revolutionary masses is the same as meeting with us. We must forever resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, care about state affairs, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!
