In London and other parts of Britain, we have met many progressive individuals who are actively studying and researching the works of Mao Zedong. A friend recently told our reporter, "Mao Zedong Thought is a precious key to observing and analyzing the complex contradictions in the world. Now, all revolutionaries aspire to China and to Mao Zedong Thought."

In another conversation, a friend pointed to an English edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and said, "This is a book of immense revolutionary power. It can ignite the revolutionary sparks in people's minds." This friend told us that in London, more than ten thousand copies of the English edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" have been published in the past, and each time they are published, they sell out quickly. Those who cannot buy them pass them around to read. He said that three of his friends had learned from a single copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" by sharing it among themselves.

A British worker friend said, "We love the works of Mao Zedong because we find in them things that we cannot find in the works of Lenin and Stalin; we love Mao Zedong Thought because it cares most about the struggles of the people of the world, and it shows us the path of struggle." This friend said, "Mao Zedong's works are the most straightforward and easy to understand. The theories he proposes are also the most suitable for the needs of workers."

This worker friend also told us that now in their factory, some workers voluntarily study Mao Zedong's works together. They use Mao Zedong Thought to observe things and guide practical struggles. Recently, they also studied Mao Zedong's insightful statement made twenty years ago about how imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. He said, "Mao Zedong made us understand that the decisive factor in winning or losing a war is the people, not weapons. He shattered the old notion of worshiping material and technology that the capitalist system had instilled in us. He also filled us with confidence in our own struggle."

Recently, some friends told us that they are studying Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," "On New Democracy," "On Contradiction," and other works in conjunction with the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution underway in China. They believe that this cultural revolution is the most significant event in human history.

    要革命的人都向往毛泽东思想
    英国进步人士和工人热情学习毛主席著作
    据新华社伦敦二十七日电　在伦敦和英国其他地方，我们遇到许多英国的进步人士，他们正在积极地学习和研究毛泽东著作。一位朋友最近对记者说：“毛泽东思想是观察和分析世界上错综复杂矛盾的一把宝贵的钥匙。现在一切要革命的人都向往中国，向往毛泽东思想。”
    在另一次谈话中，一位朋友指着英文版的《毛泽东选集》说：“这是一部具有巨大革命力量的书。它能唤起人们思想中革命的火花。”这位朋友告诉我们，在伦敦，过去曾经出版过英文版的《毛泽东选集》共一万多部，每次都是供不应求，出版一批很快就销完了。有些买不到的人就互相传阅。他说，他的三位朋友就曾经用这种办法合学一部《毛泽东选集》。
    一位英国工人朋友说，“我们热爱毛泽东著作，因为我们从它里面能够找到在列宁和斯大林著作中所不能找到的东西；我们热爱毛泽东思想，因为它最关心世界人民的斗争，它给我们指明了斗争的道路。”这位朋友说，“毛泽东的著作最通俗，最易懂。他提出的理论也最适合工人的需要。”
    这位工人朋友还告诉我们，现在他们工厂里有些工人自动在一起学习毛泽东著作，他们在学习运用毛泽东思想来观察事物和指导斗争实践。最近他们还学习了毛泽东同志二十年前发表的关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断。他说：“毛泽东使我们懂得了决定战争胜负的因素是人民，而不是武器。他打破了资本主义制度过去给我们灌输的迷信物质和技术的旧观念。他也使我们对自己的斗争充满了信心。”
    最近，一些朋友告诉我们，他们正在结合中国国内开展的无产阶级文化大革命，重新学习毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》、《新民主主义论》、《矛盾论》等著作。他们认为这次文化大革命是人类历史上最重大的事件。
