For the Revolution, We Make Lamps
— Cai Zuxuan's Academic Report at the 1966 Summer Physics Conference in Beijing

New China News Agency, August 7th — Cai Zuxuan, deputy leader of the Chinese scientific delegation, a worker-turned expert in electric light sources, and the director of the Electric Light Source Laboratory at Fudan University's Physics Department in Shanghai, gave an academic report titled "For the Revolution, We Make Lamps" at the 1966 Summer Physics Conference in Beijing. The report was warmly received by all attendees. The full text of the report is as follows:

I am an ordinary worker. Before liberation, at the age of fourteen, I entered a pharmacy as an apprentice, blowing small bottles for medicine needles. I worked for the capitalist for eight or nine years, suffering a life of exploitation and oppression. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao liberated us laborers, making us masters of the country. Under the Party's education and cultivation, our class consciousness has been continuously raised, and we have increasingly grasped science and culture. A scientific and technological force of the working class is growing stronger day by day. I am just an ordinary member of this force.

In recent years, under the Party's leadership, our Electric Light Source Laboratory at Fudan University's Physics Department in Shanghai has cooperated with relevant units to successfully develop more than ten types of new electric light sources, taking the first step in the research of new electric light sources.

Why do we make lamps? On what basis do we make lamps? We make lamps for the revolution, relying on Mao Zedong Thought to make lamps. Mao Zedong Thought boosts our revolutionary spirit. Mao Zedong Thought illuminates our path forward. Mao Zedong Thought is the magic weapon for our revolution and construction. With it, we are fearless and full of fighting spirit. With it, we fear neither heaven nor earth; we dare to fight against imperialism, modern revisionism, reactionaries of all countries, and scientific backwardness. We overcome all difficulties to strive for victory! Our Electric Light Source Laboratory, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, mobilized all positive factors, overcame all difficulties, turned disadvantages into advantages, and turned ignorance into wisdom, growing from nothing to something step by step. We started the Electric Light Source experimental group in 1961 with only three or four workers. Now, it has developed into a laboratory with over thirty people.

Our team is composed of workers and young people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We are fearless of hardship, fearless of death, seek no fame, and seek no personal gain. We have our hearts set on the country and our eyes on the world. We firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings: to be strategic in despising the enemy and tactical in respecting the enemy; to dare to fight and be good at fighting. In the past, we had no research experience in new electric light sources. For the needs of socialist construction in our country, we made up our minds, mustered our strength, and determined to break into the field of electric light source science and technology. We broke away from the superstition of Western science and technology and established the great ambition of making lamps for the revolution. Under the Party's leadership, we relied on self-reliance, thrift, and grassroots methods to obtain nationwide support. After three or four years of effort, starting from the development of the first quartz high-pressure mercury lamp, we have developed more than ten varieties. Some varieties have been serialized. Currently, we have successfully developed various instruments and lighting light sources: quartz high-pressure mercury lamps, low-pressure mercury lamps, ultra-high-pressure mercury lamps, iodine ultra-high-pressure mercury lamps, mercury amalgam lamps, cadmium lamps, zinc lamps, hydrogen lamps, deuterium lamps, thallium lamps, krypton lamps, atomic spectrum lamps of various elements, quartz iodine tungsten lamps, long-arc xenon lamps, short-arc xenon lamps, pulsed xenon lamps, sodium lamps, etc. Several types of lamps have reached the world's advanced level. All the raw materials used in the lamps we developed are produced in our country. In the development of these new electric light sources, we overcame numerous technical difficulties, such as vacuum technology, quartz processing, quartz and glass sealing, quartz and molybdenum foil sealing, glass and metal sealing, cathode preparation, processing of refractory metals like tungsten and molybdenum, gas purification, metal purification, iodine and mercury quantity control, high-pressure lamp tube sealing, etc. We also made triggering power supplies and established measurement devices. Now, most of the successfully developed light sources have been promoted to factory production. These products are playing a role in China's socialist construction. Many ports, roads, stadiums, and airports have replaced their lighting with domestically made new light sources. News photographers no longer use bulky incandescent bulbs but use our domestically made, lightweight, high-color-temperature iodine tungsten lamps. Various optical instruments' light source components are no longer dependent on imports.

In the past few years, how have we walked this path?

First, be a doer, walk the path of practice

Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On Practice" systematically and profoundly develops the Marxist theory of knowledge. It is a powerful weapon for us to understand and transform the objective world. The brilliant ideas of "On Practice" gave us immense courage and strength, enabling ordinary workers like us to strive for progress, dare to practice, be doers, and break into the field of modern science and technology.

Revolutionary practice is about changing and transforming the world. The path of practice is the inevitable path for the Chinese people, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, to achieve self-reliance and change the face of poverty and backwardness.

Before liberation, China had a blank in the research and production of new electric light sources. Before liberation, even the production of ordinary incandescent lamps was controlled by the monopolistic capitalists of the American "General Electric" company. For a long time, we could only produce tungsten filament lamps and fluorescent lamps. When our country was suffering from severe natural disasters, imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries saw an opportunity and sang anti-China songs loudly. They tried every means to "block" us, including small electric light sources. They thought they could stop the Chinese people's progress. But these gentlemen completely miscalculated. Chairman Mao repeatedly taught us: to be self-reliant and to strive hard. The tighter they block us, the harder we fight, and the faster we advance.

The research work on electric light sources has advanced through self-reliance and hard struggle. We first attacked the quartz high-pressure mercury lamp. At that time, we had no ready-made technical data and lacked necessary instruments and equipment. What to do? Chairman Mao taught us to "rely on ourselves and overcome difficulties" (Organize). These eight words are deeply engraved in our minds.

We decided to make do with what we had and start with grassroots methods, making various instruments and equipment ourselves and exploring the knowledge of new light sources on our own. Through repeated practice, we mastered the principles and technologies of quartz and metal sealing, cathode activation, exhausting, etc.; and finally, in a relatively short time, we made the first instrument light source — the quartz high-pressure mercury lamp.

Practice produces knowledge; this is a truth. Chairman Mao taught us: "Only by personally participating in the practical struggle to transform reality can one reveal the essence of things and understand them" ("On Practice"). Chairman Mao also said: "If you want knowledge, you must participate in the practice of transforming reality. If you want to know the taste of a pear, you must transform the pear and taste it yourself. If you want to know the composition and properties of an atom, you must conduct physical and chemical experiments to transform the situation of the atom" ("On Practice"). Chairman Mao's teachings made us understand that to understand the laws of electric light sources, we must engage in the practice of transforming electric light sources. This way, we can turn inexperience and ignorance into experience and knowledge, gradually transforming from outsiders to insiders.

Is it necessary to wait until we have read a lot of books before we can engage in scientific research? Can problems be solved just by reading books and looking up references? No! Chairman Mao has long pointed out to us: "Reading is learning, using is also learning, and it is more important learning. Learning warfare from warfare — this is our main method.... Revolutionary warfare is the people's business, often not learning first and then doing, but doing and then learning. Doing is learning" ("Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War"). Our knowledge of electric light sources is accumulated through doing and learning. For example, in the manufacture of ultra-high-pressure xenon lamps, the gas filling method and sealing technology are key technical issues. What method can be used to fill the appropriate amount of xenon gas? We found the cold freezing filling method in practice, which reasonably solved the problem, and we made various ultra-high-pressure xenon lamps of different powers. Therefore, as long as the direction is correct and practice is insisted upon, even those who are not graduates of a specialized school can conduct scientific experiments and conduct them well.

We emphasize practice, but we do not belittle theory. Practitioners understand the importance of scientific theory the best. We have always valued learning scientific theory. However, theory comes from practice. Book knowledge, even if it is a scientific abstraction, is still the experience of others and predecessors, which is indirect experience for us. It must be verified through practice; only then can we distinguish it, understand it, and develop it, turning it into our own knowledge. Believing in the "West" will bind ourselves and dare not do anything. We must break away from the superstition of the "West." The world is developing infinitely, and on the path of science, successors should and can walk faster and better than their predecessors! The actual situation is indeed so. When we planned to research and trial-manufacture new light sources, there was a professor with a strong admiration for Western thoughts and who considered himself an "authority." He looked down on us workers and firmly believed that we could not succeed. We did not pay attention to his nonsense and displayed the fearless revolutionary spirit of the working class: daring to think, dare to speak, dare to do, dare to venture, and dare to revolution. We dared to "touch the tiger's butt." High-power long-arc xenon lamps require a current of several hundred amperes to light up. According to foreign literature, someone used a cylindrical sealing method, making the process very complicated. We did not copy foreign technology but summarized and applied our own vacuum technology experience, designing a special structure joint, simplifying the process. The successful development of long-arc xenon lamps boosted the morale of our workers.

Existing science and technology are not absolute and static. We should not blindly follow others. We should break free from all metaphysical shackles, overcome all superstitions and inaction, and resolutely walk the path of revolutionary practice.

Second, use dialectics to make lamps

Chairman Mao's famous philosophical work "On Contradiction" grasps the core of dialectics — the law of the unity of opposites, fully, systematically, and deeply developing Marxist dialectics. Although "On Contradiction" does not mention making lamps and does not even write the words electric light sources, it tells us the fundamental principles of the development of things, guiding us to understand the essence of things and better grasp the internal laws of the development of electric light sources.

Chairman Mao teaches us: everything is one and divided into two. Everything contains contradictions. Everything internally is the universal connection of the universality and particularity (i.e., generality and individuality) of things, and therefore, human cognition is also the connection of two processes. Chairman Mao says: "These are two processes of cognition: one is from particular to general, and the other is from general to particular. Human cognition is always like this, cycling back and forth. Each cycle (as long as it is strictly according to scientific methods) may enable human cognition to advance a step, making human cognition continuously deepen" ("On Contradiction").

Chairman Mao's profound statements have greatly educated us. We use this as a guide to summarize the experience of making lamps and further explore new light sources. We see: different lamps have their own particular laws, but they also have common general laws, that is, they have individuality and generality. For example, currently, many new light sources use quartz glass as the lamp tube, relying on gas discharge or hot tungsten filaments to emit light, using high-melting-point metals sealed with quartz, etc. These are the general laws of modern electric light sources, the generality. However, due to different application purposes, the internal structure, gas filled, pressure, voltage, and power of various lamps are different. This makes each lamp have its own particular laws, forming its individuality.

Through the development of several lamps, we began to grasp some common laws of electric light sources, rising from particular to general. Guided by the understanding of these common laws, we can "from general to particular," concentrating our efforts to explore the particular laws of new light sources.

Consciously following this particular-general-particular process of cognition makes our scientific experiments clear in thought and clear in the main direction. Each time we develop a new lamp, we strive to grasp its main contradiction and strive to solve this contradiction.

For example, in the development of iodine tungsten lamps (commonly known as sun guns), we initially thought this lamp was more difficult to make. However, upon specific analysis, it was not so mysterious. It is similar to ordinary tungsten filament lamps, except that the lamp tube is filled with an appropriate amount of iodine, utilizing the chemical cycle reaction of iodine and tungsten to make the evaporated tungsten return to the tungsten filament, preventing the lamp's quartz shell from turning black; improving the lamp's luminous efficiency and lifespan. We grasped this particular essence, making it clear that the main contradiction to solve in making this lamp is the iodine filling problem. We concentrated our efforts on attacking the iodine filling problem. After multiple trials, we finally mastered a temperature difference iodine filling method, solving this problem. After solving the main contradiction, other problems were also easily solved, and the iodine tungsten lamp was quickly made.

Following this particular-general-particular process of cognition, we can grasp the internal connection between things, bringing one to bring many. For example, after making one antimony atomic spectrum lamp, we began to understand the generality of general atomic spectrum lamps. They are all hollow cathode discharges, with similar geometric shapes. The differences between various atomic spectrum lamps are mainly determined by the different elements used and different internal structures. In this way, we followed the lead, pressing the advantage, and in about a year, we made thirty kinds of atomic spectrum lamps, including a few kinds of alkali metal element atomic spectrum lamps.

Due to mastering the relationship between individuality and generality, in the same category of electric light sources, we can make lamps of different uses. Breaking through high-pressure mercury lamps, we brought out ultra-high-pressure mercury lamps, iodine high-pressure mercury lamps, etc. Making ultra-high-pressure xenon lamps brought out pulsed xenon lamps, long-arc xenon lamps, etc.

Dialectics can make lamps, and making lamps must use dialectics. This is one of the basic experiences we gained in the practice of making lamps. The methodology expounded by Chairman Mao in "On Contradiction" is an extremely sharp ideological weapon. Mastering this weapon, we can break through the heavy obstacles in scientific experiments, and any scientific peaks and cliffs we can climb!

Third, there must be a "hall of many voices" in science

Chairman Mao said: "The people, only the people, are the creators of world history" ("On Coalition Government").

Chairman Mao also said: "The masses are the real heroes, and we are often naive and laughable, not understanding this point, and cannot obtain even the most basic knowledge" ("Preface and Postscript to 'Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan'").

We follow Chairman Mao's teachings, firmly rely on the masses, fully mobilize the wisdom and pioneering spirit of the masses, and can quickly, efficiently, and economically carry out scientific research work.

The more than thirty comrades in our laboratory come from all over the country. In terms of educational background, there are primary, secondary, and tertiary levels; in terms of work positions, there are workers, peasants, and soldiers. Everyone has the same goal of contributing to the cause of socialist revolution and construction, coming together. Everyone is willing to contribute all their wisdom and strength. This is a very precious revolutionary enthusiasm, a great force hidden among the masses. With this enthusiasm and this force, we can break through fortresses and achieve victory in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation.

In scientific research work, we firmly rely on the masses, respecting the teacher, and the teacher respects the student. Whoever holds Mao Zedong Thought in their hands, we learn from them. Apprentices should learn from masters, and masters should also learn from apprentices. In researching a task, it is not the "authority" who decides everything in a "one-man show," but a "hall of many voices" with full discussion, collective wisdom, and extensive collection.

Before starting a task, we always hold a "Zhuge Liang meeting," gathering everyone to research and design plans. Regardless of whether they are workers, university teachers, or researchers, everyone has the right to speak. When encountering "difficult and complicated diseases," we convene everyone to brainstorm and find solutions. Sometimes we invite teachers and workers from related majors in our school to participate in the "consultation." For example, when developing iodine tungsten lamps, we encountered difficulties in analyzing iodine content and invited comrades who do chemical analysis and spectral analysis to help. When developing long-arc xenon lamps, high-voltage power supplies and triggering devices had problems, and we invited electrical teachers and electricians to "consult."

Our laboratory often holds mass "scientific discussion meetings," mainly summarizing our research work, and also introducing the development of domestic and foreign electric light source science and technology. Those who give reports include teachers, researchers, technical workers, and apprentices. In 1965, at the Shanghai Fudan University's school-wide science report meeting, a young glass worker from our laboratory with a junior high school education gave a report titled "Quartz and Transitional Glass Welding Technology."

Such "Zhuge Liang meetings," "consultations," and "scientific discussion meetings" have well mobilized the wisdom of the masses and activated the enthusiasm of the masses. Therefore, all the new lamps we have developed are collective creations, all crystals of the wisdom of the masses.

We correctly evaluate the role of individuals. In scientific experiments, everyone can play a role; those who are loyal to the people's cause and are willing to contribute all their strength to the socialist cause can play a greater role. The truth of science is discovered by the masses in collective struggle. Scientific workers must learn from the masses and regard the masses as their teachers.

Fourth, scientific experiments must be closely combined with production struggles

Since we started researching electric light sources, scientific research and production have been closely combined. This is mainly reflected in two aspects: one is that the development of production has greatly promoted the development of science; the other is to quickly apply scientific research achievements to production, promoting the development of production.

The socialist system established based on Mao Zedong Thought in our country is extremely superior. It is this socialist system that has created the best conditions for our scientific research. Many factories, enterprises, and research units have provided enthusiastic help to our laboratory. The quartz glass, rare gases, and refractory metal materials needed to manufacture new light sources were previously imported and expensive. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, Chinese workers and scientific and technological personnel have relied on self-reliance, daring to research and trial-manufacture, and now these things can be produced in our country. When we developed high-power sodium lamps, we needed sodium-resistant glass. A glass factory in Shanghai knew about it and immediately sent old workers, cadres, and technical personnel to find us to research together. In the process of developing sodium-resistant glass, they also invited us to the factory to visit and give suggestions. After multiple improvements in technology and formulas, a batch of sodium-resistant glass tubes was finally pulled out, enabling our research work to proceed quickly. Therefore, when some friends asked me, "Why can your small laboratory make these things?" My answer is: "Our laboratory, although small in appearance, is actually large. Many factories across the country produce raw materials for us, provide equipment, and help with processing components; many scientific research units exchange information with us and share experiences. They all work with us." Without this communist cooperation, our work would definitely encounter great difficulties.

Our cooperation with factories is roughly in three forms:

(1) "Mixed doubles": According to the needs of the state, we invite factory workers and technicians to the laboratory, or we send people to the factory to jointly determine research projects, formulate research plans, and work together. We learn from each other, help each other, exchange what we have, and fully utilize the strengths of both sides. When a new product is initially developed, we quickly organize forces to conduct intermediate production together.

(2) Invite them in: After we successfully develop a new light source, we immediately summarize the experience, invite factory technicians and workers to the laboratory to fully understand the manufacturing process and technical requirements, and organize short-term training to enable them to quickly master the development technology. Because factory comrades have rich production experience, they often propose various good suggestions suitable for factory production. It seems that we are handing over the results, but in fact, it is an opportunity for us to learn from the factory comrades.

(3) Send them out: After successfully developing a new light source, we send a team to the factory, taking all technical materials, necessary development and testing equipment, and unconditionally handing over the scientific research achievements to the factory. Our staff go to the factory as apprentices, learning the excellent qualities of the working class. This not only exchanges technical experience but also cultivates the thoughts and feelings of the working people, promoting the thought revolution of scientific research personnel.

Why can we and the factories combine so closely? Mainly relying on Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao teaches us to serve the people wholeheartedly, to benefit others and not ourselves, to give convenience to others, and to leave difficulties for ourselves. When factories need our cooperation in developing a new light source, even if we have some difficulties, we still allocate the necessary manpower and materials to meet their needs. In this way, factories regard us as their laboratory, and we regard the factory as our experimental factory. Both sides are like one family. The achievements we have made are actually the result of the joint efforts of the factory and us, the product of great cooperation. I only play the role of a screw.

Our practice proves that insisting on the close combination of scientific research and production is an important way to develop scientific research work quickly, efficiently, and economically.

Chairman Mao teaches us, "Among all things in the world, man is the most precious" ("The Failure of Idealism in History"). People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force. We are making lamps, dealing with vacuums every day. However, our minds are not vacuums; there are all kinds of thoughts. For example, for whom are we doing scientific research, for the revolution or for oneself? How to do scientific research, is it to walk the path of practice-theory-practice, or to detach from reality and walk the path from literature to literature? These are problems that must be solved. To correctly solve these problems, we rely on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in scientific research, transforming ourselves, and raising our consciousness. This way, we can quickly, efficiently, and economically achieve results for the revolution. Some university students just came to our laboratory and saw many workers doing scientific research, feeling that working in such a laboratory is a waste of themselves. We organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's "The Orientation of the Youth Movement," making them establish the determination to combine with workers and peasants and walk the path of revolution and laborization. Later, some middle school and elementary school students came. They thought they had low levels and could only be supporting actors. We repeatedly organized everyone to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and other articles. After studying, they realized that although abilities are big and small, as long as there is a red heart for the revolution, everyone can become a great benefit to the people, greatly mobilizing their enthusiasm. From here, we feel: not only do we make lamps, but we also temper people; only with revolutionary people can there be new lamps. Tempering people is to use Mao Zedong Thought to transform our standpoints, viewpoints, and methods. In recent years, we have always insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works, arranging study when arranging work; checking study when checking work; summarizing study when summarizing work.

Currently, our country is carrying out an unprecedented scale of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is a great revolutionary movement to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and promote the socialist cause. The working class, peasants, and soldiers of our country, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are breaking the old (old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits) and establishing the new (new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits), directly uprooting the ideological hegemony of the exploiting class that has been in a dominant and ruling position for thousands of years. The new historical era of the working class, peasants, and soldiers directly grasping science and culture has arrived!

Relying on Mao Zedong Thought, we fear no difficulties. The Chinese people have great aspirations and dare to change the sky and earth. Now we have just broken into the field of electric light source science and technology, as Chairman Mao said, this is only the first step of the Long March of ten thousand miles. Chairman Mao said: "The history of mankind is a history of constantly developing from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom. This history will never end. In a society where classes exist, class struggle will never end. In a society where classes do not exist, the struggle between the new and the old, the correct and the incorrect, will never end. In the realm of production struggle and scientific experimentation, mankind is constantly developing, and nature is constantly developing, never stopping at one level. Therefore, mankind must constantly summarize experience, discover, invent, create, and advance" (excerpted from "Zhou Enlai's Report on the Work of the Government at the First Session of the Third National People's Congress"). We must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings, constantly revolutionize, constantly advance, and never stop. On the great road illuminated by Mao Zedong Thought, we march forward bravely! (With pictures)

The worker-turned director of the Electric Light Source Laboratory at Fudan University, Cai Zuxuan, guided by Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizes politics, breaks away from superstition, insists on conducting scientific experiments, and successively trial-manufactured hydrogen lamps, krypton lamps, xenon lamps, and more than ten types of new electric light sources.

    “为革命造灯”
    ——蔡祖泉在北京物理讨论会所作的学术报告
    新华社七日讯　中国科学家代表团副团长、工人出身的电光源专家、上海复旦大学物理系电光源实验室主任蔡祖泉，在北京科学讨论会一九六六年暑期物理讨论会上所作的题为“为革命造灯”的学术报告，受到到会的人的热烈欢迎。报告的全文如下：
    我是一个普通工人。解放前，十四岁就进药厂当徒工，吹制装针药用的小瓶子，一吹吹了八九年，成天替资本家卖命，过着被剥削、被压迫的痛苦生活。共产党、毛主席使我们劳动人民翻了身，做了国家的主人。在共产党的教育、培养下，我们工人的阶级觉悟不断提高，并且越来越多地掌握科学文化，一支工人阶级自己的科学技术队伍正在日益壮大，我只是这一支队伍中的普通一员。最近几年来，我们上海复旦大学物理系电光源实验室，在党的领导下，得到了有关单位大力协作，研制成功了十多种新型电光源，在新型电光源研究方面走出了第一步。
    我们为什么造灯呢？靠什么造灯呢？我们是为革命造灯，靠毛泽东思想造灯。毛泽东思想长我们革命的志气。毛泽东思想照亮我们前进的道路。毛泽东思想是我们闹革命搞建设的法宝。有了它，勇气无穷，斗志昂扬。有了它，天不怕，地不怕；敢与帝国主义斗，与现代修正主义斗，与各国反动派斗，与科学落后斗，排除万难，去争取胜利！我们电光源实验室，就是在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，调动了各种积极因素，战胜了一切困难，变不利为有利，变无知为聪明，从无到有地逐步地成长起来的。我们一九六一年开始建立电光源试验小组，只有三、四个工人，现在已发展成有三十多人的一个实验室了。
    我们这个队伍是由毛泽东思想武装起来的工人和知识青年组成的。我们一不怕苦，二不怕死，三不为名，四不图利，心怀祖国，放眼世界。我们牢牢记住毛主席的教导，在战略上藐视敌人，在战术上重视敌人；要敢于斗争，善于斗争。过去，我们这些人，对新型电光源完全没有研究过。为了祖国社会主义建设的需要，我们下定决心，鼓足干劲，一定要闯进电光源科学技术大门。大破对西方科学技术的迷信，大立为革命造灯的壮志。在党的领导下，自力更生，勤俭办事，土法上马，得到全国各地的大力支持，经过三四年的努力，从研制出第一只石英高压强汞灯开始，发展到制出了十多个品种。有些品种已经系列化。目前，我们已研制成功多种仪器和照明用的光源：石英高压强汞灯，低压强汞灯，超高压强汞灯，碘化物超高压强汞灯，汞齐灯，镉灯，锌灯，氢灯，氘灯，铊灯，氪灯，各种元素的原子光谱灯，石英碘钨灯，长弧氙灯，短弧氙灯，脉冲氙灯，钠光灯等。有几种灯已经达到世界先进水平。我们研制成的灯，所有的原材料都用我国自己生产的。我们在研制这些新型电光源时，攻克了无数的技术难关，例如，真空技术，石英加工，石英与玻璃封接，石英与钼箔封接，玻璃与金属封接，阴极制备，钨、钼等难熔金属的加工，气体纯化，金属纯化，碘量和汞量控制，高气压下封割灯管等。还自己制作了触发电源，建立了测量装置。现在，大部分研制成功的光源都已经推广到工厂生产。这些产品在我国社会主义建设中正发挥着作用。许多港口，马路，体育场，飞机场，换上了我国自制的新光源。新闻摄影记者们，不再用笨大的白炽灯泡，而改用自制的轻便的高色温碘钨灯。各种光学仪器的光源元件，也已不再依靠进口。
    这几年来，我们的路是怎样走过来的呢？
    一、做动手派，走实践的路
    毛主席的光辉论著《实践论》，系统地、深刻地发展了马克思主义的认识论，它是我们认识客观世界、改造客观世界的强大武器。《实践论》的光辉思想给了我们无比的勇气与力量，使我们普通工人也敢于奋发图强，勇于实践，做动手派，闯现代科学技术的大门。
    革命的实践，就是要变革世界、改造世界。实践的道路，是我国人民在毛泽东思想指引下，自力更生，改变一穷二白面貌的必由之路。
    我国过去新型电光源的研究和制造是一个空白点，解放以前，我国连普通的白炽灯的制造，都操纵在美国“奇异”厂的垄断资本家手里。长期以来，我们只能制造钨丝灯和荧光灯。当我国正遭受严重的自然灾害时，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，又以为有机可乘，反华大合唱的锣鼓敲得很紧。他们千方百计地从各方面“卡”我们，连小小的电光源也不例外。他们满以为这样就可以挡住中国人民前进的步伐。但是，这些老爷们完全打错了算盘。毛主席一再教导我们：要自力更生，要艰苦奋斗。他们卡得越紧，我们斗得越狠，因而也就前进得越快。
    电光源的研究工作就是在自力更生、艰苦奋斗中前进的。我们首先攻的是石英高压强汞灯。当时，我们手头没有现成的技术资料，缺少必要的仪器设备。怎么办？毛主席教导我们，要“自己动手，克服困难”（《组织起来》）。这八个字深深地印在我们的脑子里。
    我们决定因陋就简，土法上马，自己动手制造各种仪器设备，自己动手去探索新光源的知识。经过反复实践，我们掌握了石英与金属封接，阴极激活，排气等原理和技术；终于在较短的时间内做出了第一只仪器用光源——石英高压强汞灯。
    实践出知识，这是一条真理。毛主席教导我们：“只有在亲身参加变革现实的实践的斗争中，才能暴露那种或那些事物的本质而理解它们。”（《实践论》）毛主席又说：“你要有知识，你就得参加变革现实的实践。你要知道梨子的滋味，你就得变革梨子，亲口吃一吃。你要知道原子的组织同性质，你就得实行物理学和化学的实验，变革原子的情况。”（《实践论》）毛主席的教导使我们懂得要认识电光源的规律，只有投身到变革电光源的实践中去。这样就能够使没经验、没知识变成有经验、有知识，逐步从外行变成内行。
    搞科学研究一定要等读了大量的书以后才能搞吗？光靠读书查文献能解决问题吗？不！毛主席早就给我们指出：“读书是学习，使用也是学习，而且是更重要的学习。从战争学习战争——这是我们的主要方法。……革命战争是民众的事，常常不是先学好了再干，而是干起来再学习，干就是学习。”（《中国革命战争的战略问题》）我们对电光源的知识，就是在边干边学中积累起来的。譬如制造超高压强氙灯，充气方法和封接技术是个技术关键。用什么方法才能充入适量的氙气呢？我们在实践中找到了冷冻充气法，较为合理地解决了问题，我们就造出了多种不同功率的超高压强氙灯。所以只要方向对头，坚持实践，不是“科班”出身的人，照样能够搞科学实验，并且能搞好科学实验。
    我们强调实践，决不是轻视理论。实践者最懂得科学理论的重要。我们一向重视学习科学理论。但是，理论来源于实践。书本知识，它即使是符合科学的抽象，也毕竟是前人、他人的经验，对我们来说只是间接的经验。必须通过实践，加以检验，我们才能辨别它、理解它和发展它，把它变成我们自己的知识。迷信“西方”就会把自己束缚起来，不敢有所作为。我们就是要大破对“西方”的迷信。世界无限地发展着，在科学大道上，后人应该、也完全可以比前人走得更快些，更好些！实际情况也确实如此。当我们打算研究、试制新型光源时，有一个崇拜西方思想非常浓厚的，并且自以为是“权威”的教授，看不起我们工人，一口咬定我们搞不成功。我们不睬他那一套，发扬了工人阶级敢想、敢说、敢做、敢闯、敢革命的大无畏革命精神，敢于摸“老虎屁股”。大功率长弧氙灯点亮时要通过高达几百安培的电流。据外国文献记载，有人采用圆筒封接法，这样做工艺很复杂。我们没有照抄外国技术，而是总结和应用了我们自己真空技术的经验，设计出一种特殊结构的接头，简化了工艺。长弧氙灯的研制成功，长了我们工人的志气。
    现有的科学技术，决不是绝对、静止不变的东西。不能人云亦云，亦步亦趋。应该摆脱一切形而上学的束缚，克服一切迷信思想和无所作为的论点，坚决走革命的实践的路。
      二、用辩证法造灯
    毛主席的著名哲学著作《矛盾论》抓住了辩证法的核心——对立统一规律，全面、系统、深入地发展了马克思主义辩证法。《矛盾论》中虽然没有讲到造灯的事，甚至没有写电光源这几个字，但是，《矛盾论》告诉我们事物发展的根本道理，它指导我们去认识事物的本质，也指导我们更好地去掌握电光源发展的内在规律。
    毛主席教导我们：任何事物都是一分为二的。任何事物都包含着矛盾。任何事物内部都是矛盾的普遍性与特殊性（即共性与个性）的相互联结，因此人类的认识也是两个过程的相互联结。毛主席说：“这是两个认识的过程：一个是由特殊到一般，一个是由一般到特殊。人类的认识总是这样循环往复地进行的，而每一次的循环（只要是严格地按照科学的方法）都可能使人类的认识提高一步，使人类的认识不断地深化。”（《矛盾论》）
    毛主席的精辟论述给我们极大的教育。我们以此为指针来总结造灯的经验，并进一步探索新光源。我们看到：不同的灯有它自己的特殊规律，也有它们共同的一般规律，即有个性也有共性。如目前各种新型光源很多是以石英玻璃做灯管，靠气体放电或炽热钨丝发光，用高熔点金属与石英封接等。这是现代电光源的一般规律，是共性。而由于应用目的不同，各种灯的内部结构、所充气体、气压、电压和功率等也不同。这就使各种灯都具有自己的特殊规律，形成它的个性。
    我们通过几只灯的研制，开始摸到了电光源的某些共同规律，从个别上升到一般。以对这些共同规律的认识为指导，就可以“由一般到特殊”，集中力量去探索新光源的特殊规律。
    自觉地遵循这个特殊——一般——特殊的认识过程，使我们搞科学实验时思路清楚，主攻方向明确。每次研制新灯，都能够努力去抓它的主要矛盾，并努力去解决这个矛盾。
    例如，我们研制碘钨灯（俗称太阳枪）。这是一种体积小，亮度高的新光源。开始时，我们以为这种灯比较难搞。但是具体一分析，它也并不神秘。它和一般钨丝灯相仿，只不过灯管内充了适量的碘，利用碘与钨的化学循环反应，使蒸发的钨重新回到钨丝上，可以防止灯的石英壳发黑；提高了灯的发光效率和寿命。我们抓住这个特殊本质，就明确了造这种灯要解决的主要矛盾是充碘问题。我们就集中精力去攻充碘关。经过多次试验，我们终于掌握了一种温差充碘法，解决了这个问题。主要矛盾解决后，其他问题也就迎刃而解，碘钨灯就很快地造出来了。
    遵循这个特殊——一般——特殊的认识过程，就抓得住事物之间的内在联系，就能以点带面。攻下一种灯，带出多种灯。就拿原子光谱灯来说吧，做出了一种锑原子光谱灯后，就使我们开始认识一般原子光谱灯的共性。它们都是空心阴极放电，几何构形相似。各种原子光谱灯的差异，主要决定于所用的元素不同、内部构造不同。这样，我们就“顺藤摸瓜”，乘胜追击，只花了一年左右时间，就搞出三十种原子光谱灯，其中还有几种碱金属元素的原子光谱灯。
    由于掌握了个性与共性的关系，在同一类电光源中，我们就可以做出不同用途的灯来。一突破高压强汞灯，就带出了超高压强汞灯、碘化物高压强汞灯等。做出了超高压强氙灯就带出了脉冲氙灯、长弧氙灯等。
    辩证法可以造灯，造灯一定要用辩证法，这就是我们在造灯实践中得到的基本经验之一。毛主席在《矛盾论》中阐明的方法论，是无比锐利的思想武器。掌握了这一武器，我们就能劈开科学实验中重重障碍，任何科学上的奇峰峻岭我们都能攀登！
      三、要有科学上的“群言堂”
    毛主席说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”（《论联合政府》）
    毛主席又说：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”（《“农村调查”的序言和跋》）
    我们遵循毛主席的教导，坚决依靠群众，充分发挥群众智慧和首创精神，就能多快好省地进行科学研究工作。
    我们实验室的三十多个同志，来自五湖四海，论文化程度，有大中小；论工作岗位，有工农兵。大家都是抱着共同的目标，为了社会主义革命和建设事业，走到一起来了，大家都愿意把自己的全部聪明才智，贡献出来。这是一种极其可贵的革命热情，这是蕴藏在群众中的一股巨大力量。有了这种热情，有了这股力量，我们就能够在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验的三大革命运动中攻克堡垒，夺取胜利。
    我们在科学研究工作中紧紧依靠群众，能者为师，师徒相长。谁手里掌握了毛泽东思想，就向谁学习。徒弟固然要向师傅学习，师傅也要向徒弟学习。研究一件工作，不是“权威”说了算的“一言堂”，而是充分讨论、集思广益、广采博收的“群言堂”。
    在一件工作开始以前，我们总是先开个“诸葛亮会”，大家凑在一起，研究设计方案。不管是工人、大学教师、研究人员，都有发言权。在遇到“疑难杂症”时，我们就召集大家出主意，想办法。有时还请我们学校里有关专业的教师、工人参加“会诊”。如研制碘钨灯时，分析含碘量遇到困难，我们就请教了搞化学分析和搞光谱分析的同志。研制长弧氙灯时，高压电源和触发装置发生障碍，就请电学教师和电气工人来“会诊”。
    我们实验室还常常举行群众性的“科学讨论会”，内容以总结自己的研究工作为主，也介绍国内外电光源科学技术的发展情况。作报告的有教师，有研究人员，有技术工人，也有学徒。一九六五年，在上海复旦大学全校科学报告会上，我们实验室一个初中程度的青年玻璃工就作了一个题为“石英与过渡玻璃焊接技术”的报告。
    象这些“诸葛亮会”、“会诊”、“科学讨论会”等，都很好地发挥了群众智慧，调动了群众积极性。所以，我们所研制的新灯，无一不是集体创造的成果，无一不是群众智慧的结晶。
    我们正确估价个人的作用。在科学实验中，每个人都可以发挥一定的作用；对人民事业无限忠诚、愿意把自己的全部力量贡献给社会主义事业的人，就可以起更大的作用。科学的真理，是人民群众在集体的斗争中发现的。科学工作者必须向群众学习，拜群众为师。
    四、科学实验要与生产斗争密切结合
    我们研究电光源以来，科学研究和生产一直是密切结合的。这主要表现在两个方面：一是生产的发展对科学的发展起了巨大的促进作用；二是把科学研究成果迅速用于生产，促进生产的发展。
    根据毛泽东思想建立起来的我国的社会主义制度是无比优越的。正是这个社会主义制度给我们的科学研究创造了最好的条件。许多工厂、企业、研究单位，都给我们的实验室提供了热情的帮助。制造新光源所需的石英玻璃、稀有气体、难熔金属材料等，过去依靠进口，价钱很贵。一九五八年大跃进以来，我国工人和科技人员，自力更生，大胆研究、试制，现在这些东西都能自己生产了。我们研制大功率钠灯时，需要抗钠玻璃。上海一家玻璃工厂知道后，立刻派老工人、干部、技术人员来找我们一起研究。在研制抗钠玻璃的过程中，还邀我们去工厂参观提意见。经过多次改进工艺和配方，终于拉出了一批抗钠玻璃管，使我们这项研究工作能够迅速进行。所以，当有些朋友问我：“为什么你们这个小小的实验室，能做出这些东西来？”我的回答是：“我们的实验室，看来很小，实际很大。全国各地许多工厂都为我们生产原料，提供设备，帮助加工部件；许多科学研究单位同我们互通情报，交流经验，他们都同我们一起在工作。”没有这种共产主义大协作，我们工作就一定要遇到很大困难。
    我们和工厂的协作，大致有三种形式：
      （一）“混合双打”：根据国家的需要，邀请工厂工人和技术人员到实验室，或我们派人到工厂中去，共同确定研究项目，制订研究计划，一起动手研究试制。互相学习，互相帮助，互通有无，充分发挥双方的长处。当新产品初步研制成功后，就同他们一起组织力量，迅速进行中间生产。
      （二）请进门来：我们在研制成功一种新光源后，便立即总结经验，邀请工厂技术人员和工人到实验室来，让他们全面地了解制造工艺和设计的技术要求，并且组织短期培训，使他们尽快掌握研制技术。由于工厂同志生产经验丰富，他们常提出各种适合工厂生产的好建议。看起来是我们移交成果，实际上是我们向工厂同志学习的好机会。
      （三）送上门去：一种新光源研制成功了，就派出一个小组，将技术资料，必要的研制、测试设备，全部带到工厂，将科学研究成果无条件地交给工厂。我们的工作人员到工厂后，当工人的徒弟，学习工人阶级的优秀品质。这样不仅交流了技术经验，而且培养了劳动人民的思想感情，促进科学研究人员的思想革命化。
    为什么我们和工厂能这样密切地结合呢？主要是靠毛泽东思想。毛主席教导我们应该全心全意为人民服务，专门利人，毫不利己，把方便让给别人，把困难留给自己。工厂在研制某种新光源时，如果需要我们配合，尽管我们有一些困难，我们也抽出必要的人力和物力，满足他们的要求。这样，工厂把我们看成是他们的实验室，我们把工厂看成是我们的试验工厂。双方亲如一家。我们所取得的成果，实际上是工厂和我们共同努力的结果，是大协作的产物。我仅仅起了一颗螺丝钉的作用。
    我们的实践证明，坚持科学研究与生产密切结合，是多快好省地发展科学研究工作的重要途径。
    毛主席教导我们，“世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。”（《唯心历史观的破产》）用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是最大的战斗力。我们是搞灯的，天天搞真空。但是，我们的脑子并不是真空，有各种各样思想。例如，为谁搞科学研究，为革命还是为个人？怎样搞科学研究，是走实践——理论——再实践的道路，还是脱离实际，走从文献到文献的道路？这都是必须解决的问题。要正确地解决这些问题，我们靠的是在科学研究中活学活用毛主席著作，改造自己，提高觉悟。这样就能够多快好省地为革命取得成果。有些大学生刚来到我们实验室，看见许多工人搞科学研究，感到在这种实验室里工作，是委屈了自己。我们组织大家学习毛主席的《青年运动的方向》，使他们树立起了与工农结合，走革命化劳动化道路的决心。后来，又来了一些中学生和小学生。他们认为自己水平低，只能当当配角。我们就反复地组织大家学习《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等文章。在学习后，他们认识到，尽管能力有大小，但只要有一颗革命的红心，就都可以成为大有利于人民的人，因而大大调动了他们的积极性。从这里，使我们体会到：既要造灯，更要炼人；有了革命化的人，才有新的灯。炼人就是用毛泽东思想改造自己的立场、观点、方法。几年来，我们始终坚持学习毛主席著作，在布置工作时，布置学习毛主席著作；检查工作时，检查学习毛主席著作；总结工作时，总结学习毛主席著作。
    目前，我国正在开展一场空前规模的无产阶级文化大革命，这是我国巩固无产阶级专政、推进社会主义事业的伟大革命运动。我国工农兵群众以毛泽东思想为武器，破四旧（旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯），立四新（新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯），正在把几千年来居于垄断和统治地位的剥削阶级意识形态连根拔除。我国工农兵群众直接掌握科学文化的新的历史时代已经来到了！
    我们靠了毛泽东思想，什么困难也不怕。中华儿女多奇志，敢教日月换新天。现在我们还刚刚闯进电光源科学技术的大门，正如毛主席说的，这仅是万里长征第一步。毛主席说：“人类的历史，就是一个不断地从必然王国向自由王国发展的历史。这个历史永远不会完结。在有阶级存在的社会内，阶级斗争不会完结。在无阶级存在的社会内，新与旧、正确与错误之间的斗争永远不会完结。在生产斗争和科学实验范围内，人类总是不断发展的，自然界也总是不断发展的，永远不会停止在一个水平上。因此，人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。”（转摘自《周恩来总理在第三届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上的政府工作报告》）我们要永远牢记毛主席的教导，不断革命，不断前进，永不停顿。在毛泽东思想阳光照耀着的大道上，奋勇前进！（附图片）
