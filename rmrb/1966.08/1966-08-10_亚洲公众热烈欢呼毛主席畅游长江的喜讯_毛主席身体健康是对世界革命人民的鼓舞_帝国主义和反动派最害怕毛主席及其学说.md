According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 9th, the peoples of Asian countries are thrilled by the news of the respected leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, swimming the Yangtze River. They unanimously believe that Chairman Mao's good health is not only a happiness for the Chinese people but also a happiness for all the people of the world.

A Burmese writer said that when he heard the news of Chairman Mao swimming the Yangtze, he was so happy that he could not describe it. He emphasized, "For all the revolutionary people of the world, this is a spiritual atomic bomb. It gives great strength to the people of the world and is a great encouragement to them."

A Burmese friend from the medical field said, "Chairman Mao's health is very good, which is the most joyful news for all progressive humanity in the world. Because Chairman Mao is in good health, he can do everything that the revolutionary people of the world hope he will do. Under Chairman Mao's leadership, the revolutionary people of the world will advance from victory to greater victory!"

A Burmese journalist said, "The news of Chairman Mao swimming the Yangtze is a heavy blow to imperialism and all reactionaries in various countries. These war-mongers are most afraid of Chairman Mao and his teachings."

Famous Burmese writer Du Ama wrote in the *People's Daily* on the 5th about the news of Chairman Mao swimming the Yangtze: Chairman Mao fought armed struggles with the Chinese people and is still fighting the unfinished revolution with them. The Chinese people maintain the closest ties with their great leader. Therefore, they love, respect, and deeply admire and trust Chairman Mao, hoping that he will always be with them.

She said, "Chairman Mao said: The Yangtze River, everyone says it is very big, but in fact, big things are not scary. Isn't American imperialism very big? We pushed back at it, and it's nothing. So, some big things in the world are actually not scary." She said that for the 700 million Chinese people, Chairman Mao's words are correct. They sincerely accept these words with their lives and experiences.

She concluded, "The United States has formed an alliance with Japanese capitalists, colluded with the Soviet revisionist leaders, recruited landlords and capitalists from the Indian National Congress, bought right-wing generals from Indonesia, gathered lackeys from Thailand, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand, surrounded China, and provoked China. At this moment, the Chinese people hear the news that their great leader, who led them in the days of great storms and is still leading them, is in such good health, of course, they feel joy and happiness."

On the 3rd, Montaz Ahmed Khan, Chairman of the Pakistan-China Friendship Association in Lahore, told a Xinhua News Agency reporter, "Mao Zedong is the greatest leader of the contemporary world, and he has an infinite influence on humanity." Chairman Mao's health has encouraged all the people fighting in the world and strengthened their confidence in winning the final victory of their just cause.

Pakistani writer Ishfaq Ahmed Khan said, "The news of Chairman Mao swimming the Yangtze makes the people of various countries happy and disappoints all imperialists. His good health is a precious asset for the cause of human progress and a serious blow to the reactionary forces in the world."

A Yemeni friend named Afas said, "Chairman Mao is not only the leader of the Chinese people but also the leader of all peace-loving people. Therefore, all peace-loving people are happy to hear the news of Chairman Mao swimming the Yangtze. This proves that Chairman Mao's health is very good."

Another friend named Ali Fara said, "Chairman Mao's health is very good, which is a great blow to imperialism and reactionaries led by American imperialism. Chairman Mao is the leader of the oppressed people, and Mao Zedong Thought is a great treasure for all humanity. He wishes Chairman Mao a long life to lead the Chinese people and all oppressed people."

An Iraqi young cultural worker told a Xinhua News Agency reporter about Chairman Mao swimming the Yangtze, "I feel very happy." He said, "Chairman Mao's health makes 'the Chinese people and the people of the world excited and encouraged. It encourages them to dare to fight against imperialism and all reactionaries, dare to struggle with nature, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory."

    亚洲公众热烈欢呼毛主席畅游长江的喜讯
    毛主席身体健康是对世界革命人民的鼓舞
    帝国主义和反动派最害怕毛主席及其学说
    据新华社九日讯　亚洲国家人民对中国人民敬爱的领袖毛泽东主席畅游长江的喜讯感到无比兴奋。他们一致认为，毛主席身体健康，不仅是中国人民的幸福，也是全世界人民的幸福。
    一位缅甸作家说，当他听到毛主席畅游长江的消息时，他高兴得难以形容。他强调说：“对于全世界革命人民说来，这是一颗精神原子弹。它给予全世界人民以强大的力量，是对他们的巨大鼓舞。”
    一位缅甸医学界朋友说：毛主席的身体非常好，这是使全世界进步人类感到最高兴的消息。“因为毛主席身体好，就能做世界革命人民希望他做的一切事情。在毛主席的指导下，全世界革命人民将从胜利走向更大的胜利！”
    一位缅甸新闻记者说：“毛泽东主席畅游长江的消息是对帝国主义和各国一切反动派的沉重打击。这些战争贩子最害怕毛主席和他的学说。”
    著名缅甸作家杜阿玛五日在《人民报》上就毛主席畅游长江的消息发表文章说：毛主席同中国人民一起进行了武装斗争，他仍然在同他们一起进行未完成的革命。中国人民同他们的伟大领袖保持着最紧密的联系。因此，他们热爱、尊敬、非常敬仰和信赖毛主席，并希望他永远同他们在一起。
    她说，毛主席曾说：长江，别人都说很大，其实，大，并不可怕。美帝国主义不是很大吗？我们顶了他一下，也没有啥。所以，世界上有些大的东西，其实并不可怕。她说，对七亿中国人民来说，毛主席的这些话是正确的。他们以他们的生活和经历热诚地接受这些话。
    她最后说：“美国同日本资本家结成联盟，同苏联修正主义领导人勾结在一起，搜罗印度国大党的地主和资本家，收买印度尼西亚右派将领，纠集泰国、菲律宾、澳大利亚和新西兰的走狗，包围中国，对中国进行挑衅。在这样的时刻，中国人民听到曾经在大风暴的日子里领导了他们、而现在还在领导着他们的自己的伟大领袖身体这样健康的消息，当然感到欣喜和高兴。”
    拉合尔巴中友协主席蒙塔兹·艾哈迈德汗三日对新华社记者说，“毛泽东主席是当代最伟大的领袖，他对人类有无限的影响。”毛主席的健康鼓舞了全世界斗争中的人民，增强了他们对赢得自己的正义事业最后胜利的信心。
    巴基斯坦作家伊什法克·艾哈迈德·汗说：“毛主席畅游长江的消息使各国人民高兴，使一切帝国主义者失望。他身体健康是人类进步事业的可贵财富，是对世界反动势力的严重打击。”
    一个名叫阿法斯的也门朋友说，毛主席不仅是中国人民的领袖，而且是所有爱好和平人民的领袖。所以所有爱好和平的人民都对毛主席畅游长江的消息感到高兴。这证明，毛主席的身体非常好。
    另一个名叫阿里·法拉的朋友说，毛主席身体非常好，这是对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义和反动派的巨大打击。毛主席是被压迫人民的领袖，毛泽东思想是全人类的巨大财富。他祝愿毛主席长寿来领导中国人民和全体被压迫人民。
    伊拉克一位青年文艺工作者对新华社记者谈到毛主席畅游长江时说：“我感到非常幸福。”他说，毛主席的健康使“中国人民和世界人民为之欢欣鼓舞。它鼓舞他们敢于同帝国主义和一切反动派进行斗争，敢于同大自然搏斗，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
