The organ of the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninists), "Pioneer," said on August 25 that the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a document of great world-historical significance.

	"Pioneer" said: "Mao Zedong has most brilliantly studied all the experience of the world revolutionary movement, including the experience of the Soviet Union. At the same time, he has studied the experience of capitalism. He has pointed out the intensity of class struggle, especially under current conditions. The imperialists are constantly attempting to restore capitalism. They are attempting to attack socialism from within. This is a matter of life and death."

	"Pioneer" pointed out that in the Soviet Union, the basis for the restoration of capitalism is the high-salaried strata of Soviet technicians, academicians, managers, and party cadres, as well as the remnants of capitalist ideology that have long existed among the people since the revolution.

	"Pioneer" pointed out that the Chinese Communists, first and foremost Mao Zedong, have boldly analyzed the question of the restoration of capitalism. Their analysis shows that intense class struggle is a concrete reality.

	The newspaper went on to say, "The process of arming the Chinese masses with Marxism-Leninism is underway in this country. If everyone understands and applies Marxism-Leninism, capitalism or capitalist ideology will not be victorious. The capitalist elements and capitalist ideology will be defeated."

	"Pioneer" said, "One of the legacies of capitalist ideology is the notion that philosophy is the affair of 'experts.' The Chinese Communists, first and foremost Mao Zedong, have shattered this extremely reactionary idea. Marxism-Leninism philosophy, Mao Zedong Thought, is first and foremost the affair of the masses."

	"Pioneer" said, "Australian revolutionaries will learn a great deal from the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. They will understand that self-reform, study, summarizing their own experiences, the mass line of work, cultivating correct attitudes and methods of thought and work, are all very necessary."

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, August 26: The leader of the "Dinamo" men's volleyball team of the Albanian Ministry of the Interior and deputy chairman of the sports club, Vaska Afedjolli, said excitedly after seeing the revolutionary actions of the young Red Guards of Harbin City in sweeping away all old thoughts, old culture, old customs, and old habits on August 23, "We enthusiastically support these revolutionary actions and congratulate the Red Guards on achieving greater victories in learning and mastering Mao Zedong Thought in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

	The Albanian "Dinamo" men's volleyball team members had a friendly conversation with some Red Guards in Harbin on August 23. When the Red Guards enthusiastically pinned a red armband on the Albanian comrades, Vaska Afedjolli said excitedly, "Thank you for your high regard for us. Your trust in us makes us very proud. For the victory of the world revolution, let us march forward together forever." The Red Guards also presented three copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to the Albanian comrades. During the conversation, the Albanian comrades and the Red Guards repeatedly raised their fists and shouted, "Enver-Hoxha, Mao Zedong," "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Comrade Hoxha!"

    澳共（马列主义者）机关报《先锋报》说：
    中共中央关于文化大革命决定有世界意义
    阿尔巴尼亚同志们在哈尔滨欢呼红卫兵的革命行动
    新华社墨尔本二十五日电　澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）机关报《先锋报》二十五日说，中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定是具有重大世界历史意义的文件。
      《先锋报》说：“毛泽东最杰出地研究了世界革命运动的所有经验，包括苏联的经验。同时，他研究了资本主义的经验。他指明了特别是在当前的条件下阶级斗争的激烈性。帝国主义者不断企图使资本主义复辟。他们企图从内部攻破社会主义。这是一个生死问题。”
    《先锋报》指出，在苏联，资本主义复辟的基础是苏联的技术人员、院士、经理和党的干部这些高薪阶层以及在革命后长期存在于人民中间的资本主义思想的残余。
      《先锋报》指出，中国共产党人，首先是毛泽东，大胆地对有关资本主义复辟的问题进行了分析。他们的分析表明：激烈的阶级斗争是具体存在的现实。
    这家报纸接着说，“用马克思列宁主义武装中国群众的过程正在这个国家进行中。如果所有的人都懂得和运用马克思列宁主义，资本主义或资本主义思想就不会取得胜利。资本主义因素和资本主义思想定将被击败。”
    《先锋报》说，资本主义意识形态的一个后遗症是认为哲学是“专家”的事情。“中国共产党人，首先是毛泽东，粉碎了这种十分反动的想法。马克思列宁主义哲学，毛泽东思想，首先是群众的事情。”
    《先锋报》说，澳大利亚革命者将从中国共产党中央委员会的决定中学到很多东西。“他们将懂得，进行自我改造，学习，总结他们自己的经验，群众路线的工作方法，培养思想和工作的正确作风和方法，是十分必要的”。
    据新华社哈尔滨二十六日电　阿尔巴尼亚内务部“狄纳莫”男子排球队领队、体育俱乐部副主席瓦斯卡·阿费卓里在哈尔滨访问期间，二十三日看到哈尔滨市红卫兵小将们横扫一切旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯的革命行动以后，激动地说，我们热烈支持这种革命行动，祝贺红卫兵们更好地学习和掌握毛泽东思想，在无产阶级文化大革命中取得全胜。
    阿尔巴尼亚内务部“狄纳莫”男子排球队的同志们，二十三日同哈尔滨一些红卫兵进行了亲切的交谈。当红卫兵热情地给阿尔巴尼亚同志佩戴上红卫兵的红袖章时，瓦斯卡·阿费卓里兴奋地说，谢谢你们对我们的崇高敬意。你们这样相信我们，使我们感到非常骄傲。为了世界革命的胜利，让我们永远共同前进。红卫兵还把随身携带的三本《毛主席语录》赠送给阿尔巴尼亚同志。在交谈中，阿尔巴尼亚同志和红卫兵们不断振臂高呼：“恩维尔—毛泽东”，“毛主席万岁！”“霍查同志万岁！”
