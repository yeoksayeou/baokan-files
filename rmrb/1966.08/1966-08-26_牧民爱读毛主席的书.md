Herdsmen Love to Read Chairman Mao's Books
Mongolian: Bao Guirong, singing

	Herdsmen love to read Chairman Mao's books,
	They strive to master the words,
	Never forget class struggle,
	Revolutionary herdsmen have the reddest hearts.
	Raise high the red flag with the east wind,
	Mao Zedong Thought will be passed down through generations,
	Forever follow the Party Central Committee,
	Forever follow Chairman Mao Zedong.
	Herdsmen listen to Chairman Mao's words the most,
	Do whatever the Party says,
	Fight against the sky and the earth,
	The grasslands bloom with flowers of victory.
	Revolutionary era's new Yu Gong,
	Fear no hardships or dangers,
	People of all ethnic groups have great aspirations,
	Paint a new picture of the grasslands.
	Follow Chairman Mao's instructions,
	Keep Mao Zedong Thought in mind,
	Gun, pen, and seal,
	We must never let go.
	Pick up the gun to fight wolves,
	Pick up the pen to destroy the black gangs,
	Hold the seal to be the master,
	The people's mountains and rivers will last forever.

   牧民爱读毛主席的书
   蒙古族　包桂红　演唱
   牧民爱读毛主席的书，
   要在用字上面下功夫，
   阶级斗争永不忘，
   革命牧民心最红。
   高举红旗乘东风，
   毛泽东思想代代传，
   永远跟着党中央，
   永远跟着毛泽东。
   牧民最听毛主席的话，
   党叫干啥就干啥，
   跟天斗争跟地斗，
   草原开满胜利花。
   革命时代新愚公，
   千难万险都不怕，
   各族人民多奇志，
   绘出草原新图画。
   毛主席指示咱照办，
   毛泽东思想记心上，
   枪杆笔杆印把子，
   我们永远不能放。
   拿起枪杆打豺狼，
   拿起笔杆灭黑帮，
   掌住印把当主人，
   人民江山万年长。
