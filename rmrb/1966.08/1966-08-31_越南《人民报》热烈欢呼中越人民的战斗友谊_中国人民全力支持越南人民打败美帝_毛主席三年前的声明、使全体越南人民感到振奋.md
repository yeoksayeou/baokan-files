The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an editorial on August 30th, celebrating the signing of the economic and technological aid agreement between China and Vietnam. The editorial warmly praises the combat friendship between the two countries.

The editorial, titled "The 700 Million Chinese People Wholeheartedly Assist Our People in Defeating the American Aggressors," states that the agreement signed in Beijing is a prominent manifestation of the deep brotherly friendship and combat unity between the peoples of Vietnam and China. It is also a prominent manifestation of the great, sincere, generous, and consistent support and assistance provided by the Communist Party of China, the government, and the people to the Vietnamese people's struggle against American imperialist aggression.

The editorial says that since the 1920s, the history of Vietnam-China relations has been one of unity and struggle, mutual support, and assistance in the fight against common enemies—imperialist invaders and their lackeys. In the past battles against French imperialism and the current battles against American imperialism, the Vietnamese people have consistently received long-term, substantial, sincere, and multi-faceted support from the Communist Party of China and the brotherly Chinese people. The Chinese people, upholding the lofty spirit of proletarian internationalism, have always stood firmly on the side of the Vietnamese people, thoroughly supporting and wholeheartedly assisting the Vietnamese people.

The editorial says, "Chairman Mao, in his multiple meetings with Chairman Hu, has always, on behalf of the Communist Party of China, the government, and the people, expressed his thorough support for our people's struggle against American imperialism and its lackeys. Three years ago, on August 29, 1963, Chairman Mao issued an important statement regarding the struggle of our southern compatriots against American imperialism and its lackeys, emphasizing, 'We Chinese people firmly support the just struggle of the people of South Vietnam.' Chairman Mao's statement has greatly inspired all our people."

The editorial says that since last year, when the American aggressors bombed North Vietnam in an attempt to reverse their failed invasion of Vietnam, the Communist Party of China, the government, and the people have repeatedly expressed their resolute stance of standing with the Vietnamese people and assisting them in defeating the American aggressors in various forms.

The editorial also mentions the support of Chinese party and state leaders for "Chairman Ho Chi Minh's Call."

The editorial says, "All of this clearly demonstrates the close and shared hardships between the peoples of Vietnam and China, clearly demonstrating the revolutionary spirit of the 700 million Chinese people, under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China headed by Chairman Mao, in resolutely opposing imperialism and defending peace."

The editorial says, "The support and assistance from the Chinese people are of great significance to our people's struggle against American imperialist aggression. This support and assistance have greatly encouraged all our military and civilians, and at the same time, have significantly enhanced our economic and defense capabilities, making a major contribution to the fight against American imperialist aggression."

    新华社河内三十日电  越南《人民报》三十日就中国给予越南经济技术援助协定签订发表社论，热烈欢呼中越两国之间的战斗友谊。
    这篇题为《七亿中国人民全心全意帮助我国人民战胜美国侵略强盗》的社论说，在北京签订的这个协定，是越中两国人民深厚的兄弟友谊和战斗团结的突出的表现，是中国共产党、政府和人民对越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略的战斗所给予的巨大、真诚、慷慨和始终如一的支持和帮助的突出的表现。
    社论说，从二十年代以来的越中关系的历史，是两国人民在反对共同敌人——帝国主义侵略者及其走狗的斗争中的团结战斗、互相支持和帮助的历史。在过去抗击法帝国主义的战斗中和目前的抗击美帝国主义的战斗中，越南人民一贯得到中国共产党和兄弟的中国人民给予的长期、巨大、诚挚和多方面的支持。中国人民发扬崇高的无产阶级国际主义精神，一贯完全站在越南人民一边，彻底支持越南人民，全心全力帮助越南人民。
    社论说：“毛主席在多次会见胡主席的时候，都代表中国共产党、政府和人民谈到对我国人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争的彻底支持。三年前，一九六三年八月二十九日，毛主席就我国南方同胞反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争发表了重要声明，并强调指出：‘我们中国人民是坚决支持越南南方人民的正义斗争的’。毛主席的声明使我国全体人民感到极大的振奋。”
    社论说，去年以来，在美国侵略者轰炸越南北方以图挽救它侵越战争的失败的时候，中国共产党、政府和人民不断表示坚决同越南人民站在一起，以各种形式帮助越南人民战胜美国侵略强盗的立场。
    社论还谈到中国党和国家领导人对《胡志明主席的号召书》的支持。
    社论说，这一切清楚地证明了越中两国人民之间的亲密和同甘共苦的同志情谊，清楚地证明了七亿中国人民在以毛主席为首的伟大中国共产党的领导下，坚决反对帝国主义、保卫和平的革命精神。
    社论说：“中国人民的支持和帮助，对我国人民反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争有着十分重大的意义。这种支持和帮助，强有力地鼓舞了我国全体军民，同时对增强我们的经济和国防潜力、进一步促进抗击美帝国主义侵略的战斗作出了重大贡献。”
