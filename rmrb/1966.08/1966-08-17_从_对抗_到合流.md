The right-wing military regime in Indonesia has signed a so-called agreement to "normalize relations" with "Malaysia." According to this agreement, Indonesia not only has to end its confrontational actions against "Malaysia" but also establish "close cooperation" with it. The revolutionary banner that the Indonesian people have held high for years to oppose imperialism and colonialism has been cut down by the black hands of the right-wing military regime. This is a blatant exposure of the Indonesian right-wing military clique's betrayal of national interests and their open surrender to American imperialism.

What is "Malaysia"? It is a new colonialist product created by American and British imperialism, a tool used by American and British imperialism to suppress the national liberation movements in Southeast Asia and subvert Indonesia. After seizing power, the Indonesian right-wing clique, in order to deceive their own people and world opinion, still pretended to declare that they would continue to "confront" "Malaysia" and continue to "oppose" imperialism and colonialism.

However, everyone knows that the Indonesian right-wing forces came to power with the planning and support of American imperialism. How could they possibly confront "Malaysia"? How could they possibly oppose their own master, imperialism? Now, the Indonesian right-wing military regime has made a complete about-face, engaging in "close cooperation" with "Malaysia." The Indonesian right-wing military regime has voluntarily torn off its mask, indicating that they can no longer continue as before, indicating that their days are numbered.

The reactionary foreign policy of the Indonesian right-wing military regime is a continuation of their reactionary domestic policy. After seizing power, the Indonesian right-wing military clique has implemented anti-communist and anti-people policies at home, while launching an anti-China and anti-Chinese wave, brutally persecuting Chinese residents, and committing numerous horrifying fascist atrocities. The Indonesian right-wing military regime's anti-China and anti-Chinese policies, just like their "cooperation" with "Malaysia," fully demonstrate that they are acting entirely in accordance with the dictates of American imperialism. Those who are pro-American will inevitably be anti-China; those who are anti-China will inevitably side with American imperialism. This has become a rule in the international class struggle.

The Indonesian people are a people with a glorious revolutionary tradition. The right-wing military clique can use their black hands to cut down the revolutionary banner of confronting "Malaysia," but they cannot cut down the firm will of the Indonesian people to resist imperialism and colonialism. The people are the creators of history. The fate of Indonesia is determined by the Indonesian people, not by a small clique of traitors who betray national interests.

　　从“对抗”到合流
　　本报评论员
    印度尼西亚右派军人政权同“马来西亚”签订了所谓“使两国关系正常化的协议”。根据这项协议，印度尼西亚不但要结束对抗“马来西亚”的行动，而且要同它建立“密切的合作”。印度尼西亚人民几年来高举的这一面反对帝国主义和殖民主义的革命旗帜，被右派军人政权的黑手砍倒了。这是印度尼西亚右派将领集团出卖民族利益、公开投入美帝怀抱的大暴露。
    “马来西亚”是个什么东西？它是美英帝国主义一手炮制出来的新殖民主义产物，是美英帝国主义企图用以镇压东南亚民族解放运动、颠覆印度尼西亚的工具。印度尼西亚右派集团在篡夺了政权之后，为了欺骗本国人民和世界舆论，还装模作样地表白他们要继续“对抗”“马来西亚”，要继续“反对”帝国主义和殖民主义。
    但是，谁都知道，印度尼西亚右派势力，就是在美帝国主义的策划和支持下上台的。他们怎么可能同“马来西亚”进行“对抗”呢？他们怎么可能反对自己的主子——帝国主义呢？现在，印度尼西亚右派军人政权终于来了个一百八十度的大转弯，同“马来西亚”实行“密切的合作”。印度尼西亚右派军人政权自动地撕下了假面具，说明它们再不能象过去那样混下去了，说明它们的日子越来越不好过了。
    印度尼西亚右派军人政权反动的对外政策，是他们反动的对内政策的继续。印度尼西亚右派将领集团在夺取政权以后，在国内推行反共、反人民的反动政策，同时掀起反华排华浪潮，大肆迫害华侨，干了许多骇人听闻的法西斯暴行。印度尼西亚右派军人政权的反华排华政策，和它同“马来西亚”搞“合作”一样，充分说明了它是完全秉承美帝国主义的意旨办事的。亲美者必然反华；反华者必然要投靠美帝国主义。这在国际阶级斗争中已经成为一条规律。
    印度尼西亚人民是富有光荣革命传统的人民。右派将领集团可以用黑手砍倒对抗“马来西亚”的革命旗帜，但是砍不掉印度尼西亚人民反帝反殖的坚强意志。人民是历史的创造者。决定印度尼西亚的命运的，是印度尼西亚人民，决不是一小撮背叛民族利益的反动派。
