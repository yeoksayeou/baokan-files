The Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam have launched three surprise attacks on the U.S. military's Phu Loi Airport in Tuy Hoa Province this year, destroying 89 enemy aircraft and killing or wounding hundreds of American invaders.

The following account describes the achievements of the third squad of a certain unit of the Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam during the raid.

Most of the soldiers in the third squad were born and raised in Chuong Thien County, where Phu Loi Airport is located. They are familiar with every thatched hut, every garden, and every field in the area. The savage American aggressors have fenced off the people's fields and gardens with barbed wire to build the airport, bringing untold disasters to the soldiers' hometown!

Now, the time for the soldiers of the third squad to take revenge has come!

The higher-ups required the soldiers of the third squad to master the skill of hitting targets with mortars without a sighting device in the shortest possible time. This requirement was indeed very difficult for peasants who had just put on military uniforms for the first time and were handling a mortar for the first time. However, no difficulty could deter them! They studied day and night, tirelessly, and memorized a large pile of complex formulas.

The order to depart was given. The soldiers of the third squad climbed mountains and crossed rivers, heading straight for Phu Loi Airport. As they ran, they encouraged each other. The third gunner patted the shiny barrel of the mortar on his shoulder and boldly recited the poem he had just written:

	“Tonight we raid the enemy's airfield,
	Annihilate the Americans, avenge our homeland.”

The enemy's cannons were roaring, firing wildly. The searchlights on the airfield crisscrossed and moved back and forth. Seeing the lights on the airfield, the soldiers' blood boiled, and their anger burned.

After a fifteen-minute discussion, the entire squad confirmed a new battle plan.

The soldiers continued their march. Someone suggested the slogan "Race against time," which was quickly adopted by the entire squad. Everyone's spirits soared, and their steps quickened.

When they reached the designated location, there were only two minutes left until the attack was launched. The soldiers quickly and skillfully set up the mortar and took their positions, ready to fire.

A signal flare tore through the night sky and fell in the middle of the airfield, and the soldiers were thrilled.

	“Fire!” Suddenly, clusters of fireworks rose from Phu Loi Airport, accompanied by the sound of explosions.

	“Hit! Hit!”

	“Comrades! Hit them hard! Make the American aggressors pay for their blood debt.” The soldiers shouted excitedly.

Angry mortar shells pounded continuously, and more and more fireballs appeared on the airfield, which soon became a sea of fire.

Explosions could be heard from the east and the west, and amidst the explosions, the screams and cries of the American devils could be heard.

Fifteen minutes passed, and the soldiers of the third squad had fired nearly a hundred shells, not a single one missing its target, hitting one after another, achieving a magnificent victory.

The heroic third squad, in two raids on Phu Loi Airport, destroyed a total of 40 enemy aircraft and killed more than 200 American aggressors. The entire squad was awarded the title "Heroic Unit in Annihilating the Americans."

　　奇袭富利机场的英雄们
    越南南方解放武装力量，今年以来已经三次奇袭土龙木省的美军富利机场，击毁敌机八十九架，打死打伤美国侵略军数百名。
    这里记述的是越南南方解放武装力量某部第三班在袭击战中的功绩。
    三班的绝大部分战士，都生长在富利机场所在的周城县，他们熟悉这里每一间草房、每一块园地和每一片田野。残暴的美国强盗用铁丝网围占人民的田园来修建机场，给战士们的家乡带来了不知多少灾难！
    现在，三班的战士们复仇的时候到来了！
    上级要求三班的战士们在最短的时间内，练好在没有瞄准器的情况下，用迫击炮击中目标的本领。这个要求对于刚刚穿上军装第一次同迫击炮接触的农民来说，的确是十分困难的。但是，什么困难也吓不倒他们！他们夜以继日地不倦地学习，把一大堆复杂的公式背得滚瓜烂熟。
    出发令下达了。三班的战士们爬山涉水，直奔富利机场。他们一边跑步，一边互相鼓励。第三号炮手抚摸着肩上擦得发亮的炮筒，豪爽地朗诵着自己刚刚写下的诗句：
    “今夜袭击敌机场，歼美报仇保家乡”。
    敌人的大炮在轰鸣，盲目地乱放。机场上的探照灯光柱交错着来回移动。看着这机场上的灯光，战士们的热血在沸腾，怒火在燃烧。经过十五分钟的讨论，全班确定了新的战斗计划。
    战士们继续赶路。不知是谁提出了“和时间赛跑”的口号，它很快就得到了全班战士的响应。大家情绪更加高昂，脚步更快了。
    当他们到达预定地点的时候，离发起攻击时间还有两分钟。战士们马上熟练地架好炮，各就各位，待命射击。
    信号弹划破夜空，落在机场中间，战士们兴奋极了。
    “开炮！”突然，富利机场上升起团团烟火，发出爆炸的巨响。
    “击中了！击中了！”
    “同志们！狠狠地打！叫美国强盗偿还血债。”战士们激动地高呼着。
    愤怒的迫击炮连续猛轰，机场上出现了越来越多的火团，然后便成了一片火海。
    只听见东边响，西边炸，在爆炸声中，夹杂着美国鬼子的惨叫声哭喊声。
    十五分钟过去了，三班的战士们打了近一百发炮弹，弹无虚发，连连命中，取得辉煌的战果。
    英雄的第三班在两次奇袭富利机场的战斗中，共击毁敌机四十架，消灭美国强盗二百多名。全班获得了“英勇歼美”单位的称号。
