The torrential wave of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is sweeping away the old ideology of the bourgeoisie with an irresistible force. In just a few days, an unprecedented revolutionary scene has emerged. Red Guards have taken to the streets in droves, smashing shop signs and names that bear the colors of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, changing the names of old streets and theaters, scrubbing away the filth of feudalism and capitalism, and uprooting the roots of revisionism. This is a revolutionary action to break with the old and establish the new. This is the marching order to open up a radiant and brilliant new world. The revolutionary actions of the young revolutionaries are excellent!

The stubborn forces of the bourgeoisie have been swept away, and their revisionist dreams have been shattered. They are helpless in the face of the surging revolutionary tide, taken aback by the rapid and powerful revolutionary momentum, and displeased with the revolutionary actions of the young revolutionaries. They say, "This is too bad."

We say, this proletarian revolutionary spirit is excellent! We must indeed overthrow the old forces of the bourgeoisie, and we must indeed rebel against the bourgeoisie. The "authorities" of the bourgeoisie say, "This is too bad." We say, the old forces of the bourgeoisie must be made a mess of; if not, they cannot be broken, and if not, the new thoughts, culture, customs, and habits of communism cannot be established.

Chairman Mao says, "A bell does not ring by itself. A table does not move by itself." The old forces of the bourgeoisie will not retreat on their own if not defeated.

Some people, in this excellent revolutionary situation, fail to recognize the situation and say, "Everything is confused." We say, the revolutionary direction is correct, advancing along the path indicated by our great leader Chairman Mao. The future is limitlessly bright, the revolutionary road is limitlessly broad, and the future is limitlessly bright. All revolutionary comrades should actively support the revolutionary actions of revolutionary students. Workers, peasants, and soldiers are the main force of the Cultural Revolution and the strong backing of the Red Guard revolutionary youths. We must strongly support their revolutionary actions and support their proletarian revolutionary spirit of rebellion. Chairman Mao teaches us to "face the wind and rain and see the world." The current mass revolutionary movement is a great storm and a great spectacle. We must temper and grow in this great storm. Without such a great storm, how can we temper the red successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause!

We most resolutely and enthusiastically support the revolutionary actions of revolutionary students! Long live the spirit of proletarian revolutionary rebellion!

We most resolutely and enthusiastically respond to the great call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and will forever follow the Party and forever follow Chairman Mao! No matter what storms or twists and turns, we will definitely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    开创光辉未来的进军号
    无产阶级文化大革命的洪流，正以排山倒海之势猛烈冲击着资产阶级的旧意识形态。几昼夜的工夫出现了一个前所未有的革命景象。红卫兵小将们纷纷涌上街头，砸碎了带有封建主义、资本主义、修正主义色彩的商店匾牌、字号，更换了旧的街道、剧院名称，洗刷着封建主义、资本主义的遗污，深掘着修正主义的孽根。这是破旧立新的革命行动，这是开辟未来光辉灿烂的新世界的进军号，革命小将们的革命行动好得很！
    那些资产阶级的顽固势力被冲垮了，他们的修正主义美梦被打破了。他们在汹涌澎湃的革命洪流面前束手无策，他们对迅猛异常的革命气势感到突然，他们对革命小将们的革命行动很不顺心，他们说这“太糟了”。
    我们说，这种无产阶级革命精神好得很！我们就是要推翻资产阶级的旧势力，我们就是要造资产阶级的反。资产阶级“权威”老爷们说：“太糟了”。我们说，对资产阶级的旧势力，就是要把它搞糟，不“糟”，就破不了，不“糟”，共产主义的新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯就立不起来。
    毛主席说：“钟不敲是不响的。桌子不搬是不走的”，资产阶级的旧势力不被打垮，它是不会自行退走的。
    有些人，在这种大好的革命形势下，认不清形势，说什么“弄糊涂了”。我们说，革命的大方向是正确的，正沿着我们伟大领袖毛主席指引的方向前进，前景无限美好，革命道路无限宽广，前途无限光明。一切革命的同志都应该积极地支持革命学生的革命行动，工农兵是文化大革命的主力军，是红卫兵革命小将们的坚强后盾。我们要大力支持他们的革命行动，支持他们的无产阶级革命造反精神。毛主席教导我们要“经风雨，见世面”，当前的群众革命运动就是一场大风雨，就是一个大世面，我们要在这个大风雨中锻炼成长，没有这样一场大风雨，怎么能够锻炼出无产阶级革命事业的红色接班人！
    我们最坚决、最热烈地支持革命学生的革命行动！无产阶级革命造反精神万岁！
    我们最坚决、最热烈地响应党中央、毛主席的伟大号召，永远永远跟着党走，永远永远跟着毛主席走！不管任何风波、曲折，一定要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
