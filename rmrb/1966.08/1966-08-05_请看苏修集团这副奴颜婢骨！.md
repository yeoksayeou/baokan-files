Look at the cringing and servile nature of the Soviet revisionist clique!

The Soviet Union's Minister of Health falsely accuses the U.S. imperialists of conducting bacteriological warfare in Vietnam, angering the U.S. imperialists, and the Soviet side hurriedly apologizes

New China News Agency, August 4th: Recent news from Moscow reveals that the shameful behavior of Soviet officials apologizing to the American representatives for the speech given by the Soviet Minister of Health at the International Microbiological Congress further exposes the ugly face of the Soviet revisionist leadership's false support and true betrayal on the Vietnam issue.

According to reports, on July 25th, Soviet Minister of Health Petrovsky, in his opening speech at the 9th International Microbiological Congress held in Moscow, in order to cover up the fact that the Soviet revisionist leadership is serving the U.S. "bombing to force and negotiate" plot, and to deceive the Soviet and world peoples, hypocritically expressed "rebuke" towards the U.S. bombing of North Vietnam and conducting bacteriological warfare in Vietnam. Unexpectedly, this false accusation angered the U.S. imperialists. The American representatives attending the conference immediately protested to the conference executive committee.

The international organizing committee of the conference and the Soviet organizing committee hurriedly apologized to the American representatives. The Soviet organizing committee even more cringingly explained to the American representatives, "It invited Petrovsky to speak, but could not control the content of his speech," and so on. In order not to offend their American partners, Soviet newspapers did not even publish Petrovsky's speech.

    请看苏修集团这副奴颜婢骨！
    苏联卫生部长对美帝在越南发动细菌战进行假指责，触怒美帝后苏方慌忙表示道歉
    新华社四日讯　莫斯科消息：苏联官员最近就苏联卫生部长在国际微生物学代表大会上的讲话向美国代表道歉的可耻行为，再一次暴露了苏修领导集团在越南问题上假支持、真出卖的丑恶面目。
    据报道，苏联卫生部长彼得罗夫斯基七月二十五日在莫斯科举行的第九届国际微生物学代表大会上致开幕词时，为了掩盖苏联修正主义领导集团为美国“以炸迫和”的阴谋效劳，欺骗苏联和世界人民，曾假惺惺地表示“申斥”美国轰炸越南北方和在越南进行细菌战。不料，这一假指责触怒了美帝国主义者。出席大会的美国代表立刻向大会执行委员会提出了抗议。
    大会国际组织委员会和苏联组织委员会急忙向美国代表道歉。苏联组织委员会更奴颜婢膝地向美国代表解释说，“它邀请彼得罗夫斯基来讲话，但无法控制他讲话的内容”等等。为了不致得罪美国伙伴，苏联报纸甚至没有发表彼得罗夫斯基的讲话。
