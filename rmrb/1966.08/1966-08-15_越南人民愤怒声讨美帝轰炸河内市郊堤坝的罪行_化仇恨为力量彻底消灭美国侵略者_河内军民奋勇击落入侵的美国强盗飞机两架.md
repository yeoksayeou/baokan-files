Vietnamese people furiously condemn the U.S. imperialists' crime of bombing the dikes in the suburbs of Hanoi, transforming hatred into strength to completely eliminate the U.S. aggressors. The military and civilians of Hanoi bravely shoot down two invading U.S. bandit planes.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on the 14th, Vietnamese newspapers published editorials on the 14th, furiously denouncing the extremely serious "escalation" of the U.S. bandit planes' savage bombing of the Red River dikes and residential areas in the suburbs of Hanoi on the 13th, and calling on the entire military and civilian population to transform hatred into strength and resolutely and completely eliminate the U.S. invading bandits.

The editorial of the *People's Daily* said, the barbaric acts of U.S. imperialism show its failure and desperate plight, which can only push it faster into the abyss of greater failure, and can only make the flames of the Vietnamese people's hatred burn even more fiercely. The editorial called on the entire military and civilian population to advance bravely with hatred towards the savage U.S. bandits, and completely eliminate the bloodthirsty U.S. aggressors.

The editorial of the *People's Army Daily* said, the armed forces of the Vietnamese people must remember all the crimes committed by the U.S. bandits, concentrate their hatred on the muzzles of their guns and cannons, and accurately destroy all new attacks by the U.S. bandits, and definitely drive the savage U.S. devils out of Vietnamese territory.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on the 14th, it was announced here that in the afternoon of the 14th, U.S. bandit planes again violated the airspace of Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The heroic military and civilians defending Hanoi, with a vengeance in their hearts, immediately shot down two U.S. jet planes with fierce artillery fire and captured a U.S. pilot.

This is the severe punishment meted out by the heroic and unyielding military and civilians of Hanoi to the U.S. air bandits who savagely bombed the Red River dikes and residential areas in the Hanoi region on the 13th.

That afternoon, U.S. bandit planes also bombed and strafed the hospital and residential areas in Viet Tri City, Phu Tho Province. Local military and civilians fought bravely and shot down a U.S. plane on the spot.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on the 14th, residents of Phu Tho Commune, Tan Ly District, Hanoi, which was bombed by U.S. bandit planes, held a meeting in the evening of the 13th to furiously condemn the bloody crimes of the U.S. bandit planes' savage bombing of the Red River dikes and residential areas that day. The attendees repeatedly shouted slogans: "Completely defeat the U.S. invading bandits!" "Promote production and war preparedness, and resolutely avenge the fallen comrades!"

Chairman Hu Gia Khanh of the Phu Tho Commune Administrative Committee spoke at the meeting, furiously denouncing the new heinous crime of the U.S. invading bandits. He said, "We must turn our grief into strength and resolutely respond to Chairman Hu's call, fight to the end unyieldingly, and will not rest until we eliminate the U.S. invading bandits!"
