	Our Huangjia Primary School, following the teachings of Chairman Mao, has adhered to the principle of serving proletarian politics through education and combining education with productive labor. We have implemented a system where academic studies are the main focus, supplemented by forestry work, for eight years. Due to the integration of teaching and productive practice, students have made solid progress and have advanced rapidly, earning the title of an advanced unit in educational quality in Shenyang City; the results of afforestation have been remarkable, and we have been recognized as a model for greening in Shenyang City.

	Before 1958, there were no trees around our school to block the wind or provide shade. Over the past few years, the more than 200 teachers and students have worked diligently, and now the poplar, elm, and pear trees around the school have grown into a dense forest. In recent years, we have also supplied 280,000 tree seedlings to more than 40 units in Shenyang and other places, and have established and managed 70 mu of nurseries for production teams without compensation.

	Loving labor and cherishing the fruits of labor have become the school spirit of our school. Usually, students eagerly take on tasks such as cleaning toilets, applying fertilizer, digging ditches, and weeding. When the teacher announces the end of the school day, students always ask, "What work will we do tomorrow? What tools should we bring?" The flowers and trees around our school have never been damaged. The desks and chairs used by the students are the fruits of their own labor, and despite being used for four or five years, they are still clean and bright.

	For a period of time, those with bourgeois educational ideas used fallacies such as "planting trees wastes study time" and "to become an expert, one must focus on studying" to oppose the combination of education and productive labor. As a result, some of the students they cultivated were only concerned with advancing their studies and did not want to be ordinary laborers, which disappointed the poor and lower-middle peasants. Later, we used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to criticize various reactionary educational ideas, organized teachers to read Chairman Mao's books, and transformed the bourgeois ideas of looking down on labor and pursuing fame and fortune. Now, the poor and lower-middle peasants are very happy to see their children become people with consciousness, culture, and the ability to labor.

	Chairman Mao's recent call to turn every industry into a revolutionary school has greatly inspired us. We will definitely follow the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao and continue to advance firmly.

　　培植了新人　绿化了大地
　　这个小学坚持教育与生产劳动相结合，学生学了文化，提高了觉悟
　　沈阳市郊区黄家公社黄家小学校
    我们黄家小学按照毛主席的教导，坚持教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，实行以学为主，兼搞林业，已经八个年头了。由于教学和生产实践相结合，学生学得扎实，进步很快，获得了沈阳市教育质量先进单位的称号；造林成效显著，被评为沈阳市绿化标兵。
    一九五八年以前，我校四周连棵挡风遮荫的树也没有，全校二百多师生，经过几年辛勤劳动，现在，学校四周的杨榆和梨桃等果树已郁闭成林。近几年来，我们还给沈阳等地的四十多个单位供应了二十八万株树苗，无偿地给生产队建立和管理着七十亩苗圃。
    热爱劳动，珍惜劳动成果，现在已成了我校的校风，平时，学生们都争着做扫厕所，施粪肥，挖沟壕，拔杂草等劳动。每天老师宣布放学的时候，学生们总是要问：“明天干什么活？带什么工具？”我校四周的花木，从来没有发生攀折现象。学生的桌椅是自己劳动成果换来的，尽管已用了四、五年，现在仍然明净光亮。
    有一段时间，具有资产阶级教育思想的人，以“植树荒废学业”，“想成专家就得专心读书”等谬论，反对教育与生产劳动相结合。结果，培养出来的一些学生，一心追求升学，不愿当普通劳动者，贫农下中农很失望。后来，我们以毛泽东思想为武器，对种种反动的教育思想进行了批判，组织教师读毛主席的书，改造轻视劳动、追逐名利的资产阶级思想，走革命化劳动化的道路。现在，贫农下中农看到自己的子弟成了有觉悟，有文化，又能劳动的人，都高兴极了。
    毛主席最近提出的要把各行各业都办成革命化大学校的伟大号召，给了我们极大的鼓舞，我们一定要沿着毛主席指出的这个方向，继续坚定地向前迈进。
