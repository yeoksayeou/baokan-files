At five o'clock in the afternoon on August 13, 1966, this was a solemn and great moment! At this very moment, the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was announced to the nation and the world. Through the Central People's Broadcasting Station, it flew to the hinterland and borders of the motherland, and to the entire world. Wherever this good news flew, the crowds there were in a state of excitement. They listened intently to the communiqué, which was personally led and formulated by our great leader Chairman Mao, and which has great historical significance. People enthusiastically cheered the new great victory of Mao Zedong Thought!

In front of the Party Central Committee's reception station, there were endless streams of jubilant crowds. People had just been celebrating the Party Central Committee's decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the meeting between our most beloved leader Chairman Mao and the revolutionary masses of the capital. Now, with the arrival of the new good news, people could no longer contain their joy. They raised their arms and shouted in unison: "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" The cheers shook the heavens and the earth. As soon as the broadcast ended, the revolutionary workers of the Homestead Public Hospital in Xicheng District sent representatives to the first stage to express their resolute support and determination to bravely execute the decision. Following them onto the stage was Jin Wei, a ten-year-old Young Pioneer from the third grade of Houdaoli Primary School. She had seen the great leader Chairman Mao on August 10. Look, though she is small, her voice is so loud and passionate. She shouted: "To our most beloved Party Central Committee, to our most beloved Chairman Mao, we, all the revolutionary teachers and students, enthusiastically cheer: 'Firmly support the Party Central Committee's communiqué.'"

She said: "Our most beloved Chairman Mao, we live by your side, closest to you. We not only heard your voice, but on August 10, we also saw you with our own eyes and shook your hand. This is our greatest happiness, the greatest happiness for all revolutionary people in the country. We will definitely read your books, listen to your words, care about national affairs, and follow you to do revolution for life." Little Jin Wei also led everyone to sing "The Ship Sails on the Sea with the Helmsman!"

Tiananmen Square became the place where millions of red hearts beat as one. As soon as the great call of the Party was issued, rows of people surged towards the Party Central Committee along the wide Chang'an Street to congratulate them. Red flags, flower baskets, drums, and songs intertwined. Many teams held high the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and marched forward with their heads held high. The endless stream of people surged forward, night after night.

The guard unit at Tiananmen heard the broadcast and held a meeting. The soldiers of the entire company were excited and determined: the troops stationed at Tiananmen must see the whole country and the whole world, and must resolutely defend the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.

At this moment, in the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works, more than a thousand workers beat drums and gongs, surging onto the streets to celebrate the issuance of the communiqué, and elected representatives to go into the city to report the good news. Many workers also held meetings and discussions. The old worker Liu Zaiqiang of the "July 27th" movement excitedly expressed: We will resolutely carry out the combat tasks proposed in the communiqué, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, carry the socialist revolution through to the end, and ensure the implementation of the Third Five-Year Plan.

The members of the China-Vietnam Friendship People's Commune heard the broadcast and immediately beat drums and gongs, running to tell each other, enthusiastically supporting the Party Central Committee's communiqué. Li Jilong, the captain of the East Sand Cow Farm militia, said, we must turn the militia organization into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. Actively respond to the call of the motherland, liberate Taiwan, and support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation.

All the representatives attending the Beijing Military Region Air Force conference on studying the works of Chairman Mao were in high spirits and collectively listened to the Party Central Committee's communiqué. Everyone excitedly shouted: Firmly support the Party Central Committee's communiqué! Firmly support the Party Central Committee's decision to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end! Pilot Yuan Zhaoxiang said: We have made all preparations for battle, ready to contribute all our strength at any time to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation and to support the world revolution.

When the good news reached the Central Institute for Nationalities, it was the time when the entire institute's revolutionary teachers and students were holding a meeting to celebrate the receipt of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." They listened to the broadcast with boundless excitement. Qi Mei Pengcuo, Qin Xianwangmu, and Zhang Yuhua, three students from poor peasant backgrounds in Tibet, said: "The communiqué is our direction. We declare to the Party and our most beloved leader Chairman Mao: We will definitely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." Aihaiti, a student from a poor peasant background in the Uyghur nationality, said: "The communiqué has great historical significance. We will definitely support it with practical actions." After listening to the broadcast, teachers and students dressed in various ethnic costumes danced the "Song of All Nationalities Singing Praises to Chairman Mao." The entire Central Institute for Nationalities was completely immersed in a festive atmosphere.

The residents of Houdaoli in Xicheng District were particularly excited. Shi Baolian said: "On August 10, I saw Chairman Mao at the reception station and was so excited that I couldn't sleep all night. Today, the Party has issued a battle call to us. I firmly declare: Wherever the motherland needs me to go, whatever the motherland needs me to do, I will not be afraid of hardship, not be afraid of fatigue, and not be afraid of sacrifice."

After nine o'clock in the evening, it rained heavily. However, the enthusiasm of the revolutionary masses of the capital reached its peak. Teams from schools, factories, offices, and the military, carrying giant portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao and large red banners, singing and dancing, surged in from all directions. The square in front of the Party Central Committee's reception station was like a sea of excitement. People were willing to get soaked themselves but carefully covered Chairman Mao's portrait with raincoats and umbrellas. The members of the Song and Dance Troupe of the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army sang their newly composed song "Cheering the Communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session" in the rain: "Mountains are cheering, seas are laughing, the red sun is rising, the bright lamp is shining high, the Party Central Committee issues a communiqué, the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought is held high."

    一九六六年八月十三日下午五时，这是一个庄严的、伟大的时刻！就在此刻，党的八届十一中全会公报，向全国全世界公布了。通过中央人民广播电台，飞向祖国的内地和边疆，飞向全世界。这个喜讯飞到哪里，哪里的人群一片欢腾。他们全神贯注，倾听由我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自领导制定的、具有重大历史意义的公报。人们热烈欢呼毛泽东思想的新的伟大胜利！
    在党中央接待站前，聚满了川流不息的欢腾的队伍。人们刚刚还在为党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定、为我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席会见首都革命群众而狂欢庆贺，现在，新的喜讯传来，人们越发抑制不住内心的喜悦，他们齐声振臂高呼：“中国共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”欢呼声震天动地。广播刚结束，西城区丰盛公社医院革命职工就派出代表，第一个奔上报喜台，表示坚决拥护、勇敢执行的决心。随着登台的是后达里小学三年级学生、十岁的少先队员靳维。她在八月十日曾经见到伟大的领袖毛主席。你看，她人虽小，声音却是那么宏亮、热情。她欢呼：“我们最最敬爱的党中央，最最敬爱的毛主席，我们全体革命师生最热烈地欢呼：‘坚决拥护党中央的公报’。”她说：“我们最最敬爱的毛主席，我们就生活在您的身边，离您最近最近，我们不仅听到了您的声音，八月十日，我们还亲眼见到了您，跟您握了手，这是我们最大最大的幸福，是全国革命人民最大最大的幸福。我们一定认真读您的书，听您的话，关心国家大事，永远紧紧地跟着您干一辈子革命。”小靳维还带领大家高歌《大海航行靠舵手》！
    天安门广场，成了千万颗红心共同跳跃的地方。党的伟大号召刚刚发出，这儿就出现了一列列顺着宽阔的长安街涌向党中央去贺喜的队伍。红旗、花束、锣鼓、歌唱，交织在一起。许多队伍，人人手中高举着《毛主席语录》，昂首前进。川流不息的人群，浩浩荡荡，彻夜不绝。
    守卫天安门的警卫部队，收听了广播后，全连战士欢欣鼓舞地举行了座谈。他们坚决表示：站在天安门的部队，要看到全国，看到全世界，要坚决保卫党中央，保卫毛主席。
    此刻，在长辛店机车车辆厂，有一千多工人，敲锣打鼓，涌向街头，庆祝公报的发表，并推举了代表，进城报喜。许多职工还纷纷集会，举行了座谈。“二七”老工人刘再祥兴奋地表示：我们要最坚决地执行公报所提出的战斗任务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把社会主义革命进行到底，保证实现第三个五年计划。
    中越友好人民公社社员听了广播，立即敲锣打鼓，奔走相告，热烈拥护党中央的公报。东沙牛场民兵连长李继龙说，我们一定要把民兵组织办成毛泽东思想的大学校。积极响应祖国召唤，解放台湾，支援越南抗美救国斗争。

    当喜讯传到中央民族学院，正是全院革命师生集会庆祝喜得《毛泽东选集》的时候，他们以无限兴奋的心情收听了广播。西藏贫苦农奴出身的齐美彭错、勤线旺姆、张玉华三位同学说：“公报是我们前进的方向。我们向党和我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席表示决心：一定要将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。”贫农出身的维吾尔族同学艾合买提说：“公报具有伟大的历史意义，我们一定以实际行动来坚决拥护。”听完广播后，穿着各种民族服装的师生，情不自禁地跳起了“各族人民歌唱毛主席”的舞蹈。整个中央民族学院完全浸沉在狂欢的气氛中。
    西城区后达里的居民们心情特别激动。时宝莲说：“八月十日我在接待站见到了毛主席，兴奋得一夜没睡着觉。今天党又向我们发出了战斗号召，我坚决表示：祖国需要我到哪里去，需要我干什么，我决不怕苦，不怕累，不怕牺牲。”
    夜晚九点钟以后，大雨滂沱。首都革命群众的热烈情绪却达到了最高潮。学校、工厂、机关、部队的报喜队伍，抬着伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像，抬着大红喜报，载歌载舞，从四面八方不断涌来。党中央接待站前的广场上，象一片欢腾的海洋。人们宁愿自己淋得透湿，却把雨衣、雨伞珍重地遮着毛主席像。解放军总政治部文工团歌舞团的同志们在雨下得最大的时候，高唱了自己新编的歌曲《欢呼十一中全会公报》：“山在欢呼，海在欢笑，红日东升，明灯高照，党中央发公报，毛泽东思想红旗举得高。”
