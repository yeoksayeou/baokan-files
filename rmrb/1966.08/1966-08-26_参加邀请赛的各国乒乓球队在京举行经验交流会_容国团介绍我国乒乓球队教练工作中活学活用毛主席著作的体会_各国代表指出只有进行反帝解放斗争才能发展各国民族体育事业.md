Ping-pong teams from various countries participating in the Beijing International Ping-Pong Invitational held an experience exchange meeting in Beijing. Coach of the Chinese ping-pong team, Rong Guotuan, shared his experiences of applying Chairman Mao's works in the team's training. Representatives from various countries pointed out that only by engaging in anti-imperialist liberation struggles can the national sports of various countries develop.

		New China News Agency, August 25th: Today, at an experience exchange meeting attended by team leaders and coaches from various countries and regions participating in the Beijing International Ping-Pong Invitational, Coach Rong Guotuan of the Chinese ping-pong team shared his experiences of applying Mao Zedong Thought in the team's training work. Rong Guotuan said: In training work, I have found that the most fundamental principle is to arm oneself and the athletes with the great Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is advancing towards global victory. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all our work. The Chinese ping-pong team has grown up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. Every step of our progress is thanks to Mao Zedong Thought.

		Chairman Mao teaches us: "Among all things in the world, people are the most precious." People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force. The ball is dead, but people are alive. The ball relies on people to play. With the correct ideology, people can generate tremendous material force. Practice tells us that during competitions, various situations often arise. Even if one's technique is superior, incorrect guiding ideology can turn advantages into disadvantages, leading to failure. If one's technique is inferior but the guiding ideology is correct, disadvantages can turn into advantages, ultimately leading to victory. When two teams with similar technical levels compete, the ideological factor plays a decisive role in determining the winner.

		Rong Guotuan emphasized in his speech that we particularly value people and focus on ideological work, placing the active application of Mao Zedong Thought at the forefront of all our work. Through studying Chairman Mao's works, athletes have come to understand that China's sports work is part of the socialist construction cause. In China, playing ping-pong is also a revolutionary task, serving the people rather than individual interests. With a proletarian worldview of wholeheartedly serving the people, athletes can set their minds on revolution, have broad horizons, and truly achieve the goal of "being on the court but thinking of the country, looking at the world." They understand that climbing to the world's peak will encounter many difficulties. But when they think of how the Chinese people were humiliated and called the "Sick Man of Asia" before liberation, and when they think of how American imperialism is still bullying the people of China and Asia, Africa, and Latin America today, the revolutionary spirit drives them to overcome difficulties with boundless courage and determination. They strive to be self-reliant and forge ahead, facing difficulties head-on. In daily training, they maintain high revolutionary consciousness and abundant energy, persevering in diligent practice, fearing neither hardship nor difficulty, and becoming stronger with each practice. During competitions, they exhibit fearless heroism and firm beliefs, daring to fight, daring to win, daring to compete, and daring to challenge, becoming more spirited with each match. When they achieve victory, they remember Chairman Mao's teachings: to serve the people completely and thoroughly, thus avoiding arrogance and impatience, continuously revolutionizing, never being satisfied, and striving for perfection.

		In discussing the team's experience of using Mao Zedong Thought to guide their play, Rong Guotuan pointed out that Mao Zedong Thought is a universal truth applicable everywhere and at all times. He said that ping-pong is a highly competitive sport, with complex and ever-changing situations during matches, requiring athletes to have the correct guiding ideology in strategy and tactics. Here, Mao Zedong Thought provides us with a brilliant guiding principle: "In strategy, we must despise all enemies; in tactics, we must take all enemies seriously." We have come to understand that no matter how strong the opponent or how great the difficulty, we must first dare to despise it in our minds, believing that we can defeat it. Playing ping-pong is like opposing imperialism; only by despising the enemy strategically can we increase our confidence and courage to overcome difficulties, dare to fight, dare to win, and turn spiritual force into tremendous material force. While despising the enemy strategically, we must also address the issue of taking the enemy seriously tactically. This means using the one-divides-into-two approach to concretely analyze the favorable and unfavorable conditions of both sides, acknowledging difficulties, analyzing difficulties, and solving difficulties. In specific preparations, we must be meticulous and consider all possible unexpected situations, formulating several action plans, thus being well-prepared and building strategic contempt for the enemy on a reliable foundation. By following Chairman Mao's teachings, we can achieve victory; otherwise, we will suffer defeat.

		In his speech, Rong Guotuan quoted two important directives from Chairman Mao: "The people, only the people, are the motive force of world history." "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ridiculous. Not understanding this, one cannot gain even the most basic knowledge." We follow Chairman Mao's teachings, trusting and relying on the masses in our coaching work, first being students of the masses and then their teachers, opposing "one-man rule" and advocating "collective wisdom." This approach fully unleashes the collective wisdom of the athletes, mobilizing their enthusiasm and creativity.

		Rong Guotuan concluded by saying that in practice, I deeply feel that Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts, and Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon for all revolutionary people. We have boundless love, faith, and admiration for the great Mao Zedong Thought. To revolutionize and advance, we must read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide all our actions. We will forever advance under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought!

		New China News Agency, August 25th: Today, team leaders, coaches, and representatives from various countries and regions participating in the 1966 Beijing International Ping-Pong Invitational held an experience exchange meeting in a highly sincere and friendly atmosphere, sharing valuable experiences of independently and autonomously developing sports, mutually promoting, and uniting against imperialism.

		Many representatives of the ping-pong teams spoke about how only by opposing imperialism and engaging in national liberation struggles can the sports of various countries truly develop. The head of the Palestinian ping-pong delegation, Salam Shurafa, emphasized the inseparable connection between developing national sports and opposing imperialism. He said that since the establishment of the Palestinian Ping-Pong Association in 1964, ping-pong has rapidly developed, aiming to oppose imperialism and liberate the Palestinian people from the oppression of Israel and its backers. The head of the Yemeni ping-pong delegation, Abdul Wahid Shandani, mentioned that the first task of their revolution is to strengthen relations with friendly countries and fight against imperialism.

		The head of the Vietnamese ping-pong delegation, Nguyen Duc Thao, began his speech by quoting a statement from Chairman Mao supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression. Chairman Mao said: "We Chinese people firmly support the just struggle of the South Vietnamese people. I am deeply convinced that the South Vietnamese people will certainly achieve the goal of liberating South Vietnam through struggle and make a contribution to the peaceful reunification of the motherland." Nguyen Duc Thao expressed gratitude to the Chinese people and people of the world for their enthusiastic support of the Vietnamese people's anti-American struggle and said: Vietnamese athletes and sports workers, who develop ping-pong in the midst of war, will, together with all Vietnamese people, continue the struggle against American imperialism to the end. We are confident that with the support of the world's people, the Vietnamese people will definitely defeat American imperialism! He and representatives from Syria, Pakistan, and other countries believed that athletes and sports workers cannot just focus on playing ping-pong; they must also care about and actively participate in the struggle against imperialism. The head of the Syrian ping-pong delegation, Ahmed Kumayd, said that imperialism invades and oppresses us, and we must rise up to fight. Experience tells us that only by shedding blood can we gain independence, and only by struggling can we defeat imperialism.

		Nguyen Duc Thao also spoke about organizing athletes to visit military personnel who had shot down American planes. He pointed out that to develop ping-pong, the most important thing is to promote the ideological revolution of athletes, making them understand that they are playing for the people and the country, especially to constantly ignite their hatred towards American imperialism, using the spirit of the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression in competitions and training. The heads of the Cambodian and Japanese ping-pong delegations also shared their valuable experiences in developing ping-pong and cultivating athletes.

		The representatives of various delegations highly praised the Beijing International Ping-Pong Invitational, believing it to be a great initiative for athletes from various countries to engage in friendly exchanges, mutual promotion, and united struggle against imperialism. The head of the Sri Lankan ping-pong delegation, Arulampalam Vithiyalingam, and the head of the North Korean ping-pong delegation, Kim Young-ho, pointed out in their speeches that although the history of the Beijing International Ping-Pong Invitational is short, the increasing number of participating countries signifies the unity and strength of emerging forces. The leader of the Pakistani ping-pong team, Faruq Zaman, said that the friendship between China and Pakistan closely binds our two countries together. This friendship is not a temporary measure but has a solid foundation. He and the head of the Lebanese delegation, Michel Mwansor Sbat, and the leader of the Nepalese ping-pong team, Joshi, expressed their hope to further strengthen the fighting unity and friendship among the peoples and athletes of various countries through this Beijing Invitational and hoped that the invitational would continue indefinitely.

		The Chinese team coach, Rong Guotuan, shared the experience of the Chinese ping-pong team hoisting the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and using Mao Zedong Thought to guide training and competition. Rong Guotuan's speech was highly praised by many foreign representatives.

    参加邀请赛的各国乒乓球队在京举行经验交流会
    容国团介绍我国乒乓球队教练工作中活学活用毛主席著作的体会
    各国代表指出只有进行反帝解放斗争才能发展各国民族体育事业
    新华社二十五日讯　中国乒乓球队教练容国团，今天在参加北京国际乒乓球邀请赛的各国家和地区的领队、教练的经验交流会上，介绍了中国乒乓球队教练工作中活学活用毛泽东思想的体会。容国团说：在教练工作中，我体会到最根本的一条是要用伟大的毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑和运动员的头脑。毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东思想是帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是我们一切工作的指导方针。我们中国乒乓球队就是在毛泽东思想的哺育下成长起来的，我们在前进途中每一点进步，都是靠的毛泽东思想。
    毛主席教导我们：“世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。”用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是最大的战斗力。球是死的，人是活的，球靠人来打。人有了正确的思想，就能产生巨大的物质力量。实践告诉我们，比赛经常会出现种种不同情况，技术比对方强，但指导思想错误，优势会转化为劣势，甚至遭到失败。技术比对方差，但指导思想正确，劣势也会转化为优势，最后可以取得胜利。两个技术水平不相上下的球队相遇，谁胜谁负，思想因素更是起着决定性的作用。
    容国团在发言中指出，我们特别重视人，重视做人的思想工作，把活学活用毛泽东思想放在一切工作的首位。运动员们通过学习毛主席著作，明确认识到中国的体育工作是社会主义建设事业的一部分。在中国，打乒乓球也是革命工作，是为人民服务，而不是为了个人。有了全心全意为人民服务的无产阶级世界观，树立起为革命打球的思想，运动员们就能够不为名不为利，心胸开阔，眼光远大，真正做到“身在球场，心怀祖国，放眼世界”。他们懂得攀登世界高峰会遇到许多困难。但当他们想到中国人民解放前受帝国主义侵略被侮辱地称为“东亚病夫”时，当他们想到美帝国主义今天还在欺侮我国和亚非拉各国人民时，革命的怒火促使他们产生了战胜困难的无穷的力量和勇气，决心发奋图强，自力更生，迎着困难前进。平时训练，他们就有高度的革命自觉和充沛的干劲，坚持勤学苦练，不怕苦不怕难，越练越有劲。比赛时就有大无畏的英雄气概和坚强的信念，敢于斗争，敢于胜利，敢打敢拚，敢闯敢搏，越打越有精神。在取得胜利时，他们牢记毛主席的教导：为人民服务，要做到“完全”“彻底”，因此能够做到戒骄戒躁，不断革命，永不满足，精益求精。
    容国团在谈到中国乒乓球队用毛泽东思想指导打球的体会时指出，毛泽东思想是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理，时时处处都能用，用到那里那里灵。他说，乒乓球运动是对抗性很强的运动项目，比赛过程中矛盾复杂，千变万化，要求运动员在战略战术上有正确的指导思想。在这里，毛泽东思想给我们指出了英明的指导方针，这就是“在战略上我们要藐视一切敌人，在战术上我们要重视一切敌人”。我们体会到，不管遇到多么强大的对手，不管碰到多么大的困难，首先都要从思想上敢于藐视它，相信自己能够打败它。打球也同反对帝国主义一样，只有在战略上藐视敌人，才能增强我们战胜困难的信心和勇气，敢于斗争，敢于胜利，把精神力量变为巨大的物质力量。在战略上藐视敌人的同时，还必须解决在战术上重视敌人的问题。这就是，要用一分为二的观点，具体分析敌我双方的有利条件和不利条件，承认困难，分析困难，解决困难。在具体准备工作中，要认真细致，尽可能估计到各种意外情况，制定出几种作战方案，这样就可以做到胸有成竹，把战略上对敌人的藐视建立在可靠的基础上。我们按照毛主席教导去做，就能胜利，否则就会遭到失败。
    容国团在发言中引用了毛主席的这样两个重要指示：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的。不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”我们遵循毛主席的教导，在教练工作中信任群众，依靠群众，先当群众的学生，再当群众的先生，反对“一言堂”，提倡“群言堂”。这样做的结果，就充分发挥了运动员的集体智慧，调动了运动员的积极性和创造性。
    容国团最后说，我在实践中深深体会到，毛主席是我们心中的红太阳，毛泽东思想是一切革命人民的灯塔。我们对伟大的毛泽东思想无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜。要革命，要前进，就要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，用毛泽东思想指导我们的一切行动。我们将永远在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下前进！
    新华社二十五日讯　参加一九六六年北京国际乒乓球邀请赛的国家和地区乒乓球队的团长、领队和教练，今天在极其诚挚友好的气氛中举行经验交流会，畅谈各参加国和地区人民独立自主地发展体育运动、互相促进、团结反帝的宝贵经验。
    许多乒乓球队的代表都谈到：只有反对帝国主义，进行民族解放斗争，各国人民的体育事业才能真正地发展起来。巴勒斯坦乒乓球代表团团长萨拉姆·舒拉法在发言中强调发展民族体育事业和反对帝国主义的不可分割的联系。他说，巴勒斯坦从一九六四年成立乒乓球协会以来，乒乓球运动有了迅速发展，我们的目的，就是为了反对帝国主义的共同事业，为了从以色列和它背后的支持者的侵略、压迫下解放出来。也门乒乓球代表团团长阿卜杜·瓦希德·申达尼在发言中说，我国革命的第一件事，就是要加强和友好国家的关系，进行反对帝国主义的斗争。
    来自反美斗争最前线的越南乒乓球代表团团长阮得寿在开始发言时，引用了中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席支持越南人民抗美救国斗争的一段话。毛主席说：“我们中国人民是坚决支持越南南方人民的正义斗争的。我深信，越南南方人民一定能够通过斗争实现解放越南南方的目标，并且为祖国的和平统一作出贡献。”阮得寿表示感谢中国人民和世界各国人民对越南人民抗美斗争的热情支持，并且说：在战火中开展乒乓球运动的越南运动员和体育工作者，将和全体越南人民一起，把反对美帝国主义的斗争进行到底，我们深信，得到世界人民支持的越南人民，一定能打败美帝国主义！他和叙利亚、巴基斯坦等国家乒乓球代表团的代表都认为，运动员和体育工作者不能只管打球，还必须关心和积极投入反对帝国主义的斗争。叙利亚乒乓球代表团团长艾哈迈德·库迈德说，帝国主义侵略压迫我们，我们必须起来进行斗争。经验告诉我们，只有付出鲜血才能赢得独立，只有经过斗争才能打败帝国主义。
    阮得寿在发言中还谈到他们组织运动员到击落美机的军民中参观访问的体会。他指出，要发展乒乓球运动，最主要的是要促进运动员的思想革命化，使他们知道为人民服务，为祖国而打球，特别是要不断地激发他们对美帝国主义的仇恨，把越南人民抗美救国的斗争精神用之于比赛和练习。柬埔寨乒乓球代表团团长奈河和日本乒乓球队教练荻村，也在座谈会上介绍了他们发展乒乓球运动和培养运动员的宝贵经验。
    各代表团的代表，对北京国际乒乓球邀请赛给予高度评价，认为它是各国运动员友好交往、互相促进、团结反帝的一个伟大创举。锡兰乒乓球代表团团长阿鲁兰帕拉姆·维蒂亚林甘、朝鲜乒乓球代表团团长金英镐等在发言中指出，北京国际乒乓球邀请赛的历史虽然很短，但参加的国家越来越多，这个事实本身，就意味着新兴力量的团结和壮大。巴基斯坦乒乓球队领队法鲁克·扎曼说，中国和巴基斯坦的友谊把我们两国紧紧连接在一起，我们的这种友谊并不是权宜之计，而是有着巩固的基础的。他和黎巴嫩代表团团长米歇尔·姆万索尔·斯巴特、尼泊尔乒乓球队的乔希等代表团的负责人都表示，希望通过这次北京邀请赛进一步加强各国人民和运动员战斗的团结和友谊，希望邀请赛永远举办下去。
    中国队教练容国团介绍了中国乒乓球队高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，用毛泽东思想指导训练和比赛的经验。容国团的发言受到许多外国代表的热烈称赞。
