The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, after reading the anti-Party, anti-socialist views of Na Sun Yefang, especially his malicious slander against Mao Zedong Thought, are all indignant and have risen up to condemn him.

Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all our work. To carry out the socialist revolution, we rely on Mao Zedong Thought. To build socialism, we also rely on Mao Zedong Thought. Comrades like Xue Guobang and Chen Yonggui have proven with the brilliant achievements of Daqing and Dazhai that once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the working people, it can change the spiritual face of the working people and turn spiritual power into tremendous material force. They enthusiastically sing praises: "Chairman Mao's works point the way, people change their minds and factories change their equipment." "Red thoughts, all things succeed. Those armed with Mao Zedong Thought dare to change the world." This is the deep feeling of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. In all our work in industry, agriculture, commerce, and the military, in all our undertakings, we must only let Mao Zedong Thought take the lead, then we can be invincible.

Whatever the enemy hates, we love; whatever the enemy loves, we hate! The more Na Sun Yefang hates Mao Zedong Thought to the bone, the more we love and respect Mao Zedong Thought without limit. We must turn every industry into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought. Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fight Na Sun Yefang until he is stinky and fallen, and sweep away all ghosts and snakes!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Politics is the commander, the soul." "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." Na Sun Yefang, however, slanders us: "Separating economics from politics," "replacing economic explanations with political explanations" is "idealism," "lazy thinking." This is openly opposing Chairman Mao, openly resisting the use of Mao Zedong Thought as the highest directive for all work. We firmly oppose this fallacy. We deeply feel that to do all work well, we must rely on Mao Zedong Thought to take the lead. Economic construction work is no exception. Our Daqing Oil Field is also built on Mao Zedong Thought.

In 1960, when the oil war began, the difficulties were indeed great, and there wasn't even a place to live. The first decision made by the oil field party committee was to have everyone study "On Practice" and "On Contradiction." After studying, we indeed used the perspective of class struggle and dialectical materialism to analyze, study, and solve a series of problems. If it weren't for Mao Zedong Thought arming us, under such conditions, we wouldn't even be able to stand, let alone think about taking down a big oil field.

After the battle began, the oil field party committee proposed that oil should be transported out within three months. At that time, the conditions were poor, and there were many difficulties in pumping the crude oil to the oil depot and loading it onto trains. The leadership assigned this task to us. We worked day and night, carrying steam pipes, standing in the crude oil in the oil pools to fight. Some comrades couldn't complete their tasks, couldn't eat, and couldn't sleep. This revolutionary spirit comes from the great Mao Zedong Thought. At that time, everyone clearly realized that imperialism was blockading us, and revisionism was choking us. Chairman Mao taught us to be self-reliant and strive for strength. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We first fought a political battle, a battle of will! Only by winning this political battle and battle of will can we win the production battle and economic battle of taking down the oil field. We made up our minds to fight for the honor of the Chinese people, to die to transport the oil out. It was with this revolutionary spirit that we trampled all difficulties underfoot, not only ensuring that the first trainload of crude oil was transported out on time but also taking down the Daqing Oil Field, ensuring the needs of socialist construction, and supporting the world's revolutionary people.

All our achievements are due to Mao Zedong Thought. Daqing was built on the "Two Essays." We cannot do without Mao Zedong Thought for a moment. With it, we have direction, spirit, and strength; with it, we dare to face knife mountains and fire seas, and we will trample all great difficulties underfoot. The people of Daqing will forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. We will definitely turn the Daqing Oil Field into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought. Na Sun Yefang, you dare to use the revisionist fallacy of "profit-taking" and "money-taking" to oppose Chairman Mao's great directive that politics is the soul and the commander, that political work is the lifeline of all economic work. We will not agree, and we will definitely fight you until you are stinky, fallen, and crushed!

    首先打好政治仗　才能打好经济仗
    大庆油田采油副指挥　薛国邦
    编者的话
    广大的工农兵群众，看了反党反社会主义分子孙冶方的修正主义谬论，特别是他对毛泽东思想的恶毒污蔑，无不义愤填膺，群起声讨。
    毛泽东思想是我们一切工作的指导方向。搞社会主义革命，靠的是毛泽东思想。搞社会主义建设，同样要靠毛泽东思想。薛国邦、陈永贵等同志用大庆、大寨等建设的辉煌成就，无可辩驳地证明毛泽东思想一旦被劳动人民所掌握，就能改变劳动人民的精神面貌，就能使精神力量转化为巨大的物质力量。他们热情地歌颂：“毛主席著作指方向，人变思想厂换装。”“思想红，百事成。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，敢教日月换新天。”这是广大工农兵的深切感受。我们搞工业、农业、商业、军事工作，搞一切事业，只有用毛泽东思想挂帅，才能无往而不胜。
    凡是敌人恨的，我们就爱；凡是敌人爱的，我们就恨！孙冶方对毛泽东思想越是恨之入骨，我们对毛泽东思想就越是无限热爱和崇敬，我们越是要把各行各业都办成毛泽东思想的大学校。让我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把孙冶方斗臭、斗倒，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神！
    毛主席教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂。“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”孙冶方却污蔑我们：“脱离了经济来谈政治”，“把政治上的说明来代替经济上的说明”，是“唯心论”，是“懒汉思想”。他这是和毛主席公开唱对台戏，是公开抵制把毛泽东思想当作一切工作的最高指示。我们坚决反对这种谬论。我们深切体会到，要搞好一切工作，必须靠毛泽东思想挂帅，经济建设工作也是一样。我们大庆油田，就是靠毛泽东思想打出来的。
    一九六○年石油会战一上手，困难确实很大，连个住的地方都没有。油田党委发出的第一个决定，就是要大家学习《实践论》和《矛盾论》。大家学习后，确是用阶级斗争的观点，用辩证唯物主义的观点，去分析、研究并解决了一系列问题。要不是毛泽东思想武装了我们，在那样的条件下，我们连脚都站不住，要拿下大油田，更是想都不敢想的事。
    会战开始以后，油田党委提出三个月内就要往外运油。当时条件很差，要把原油打到油库装上火车有很多困难。领导上把这个任务交给了我们。我们不分白天黑夜，拿着蒸气管子，下油池站在原油里战斗。有的同志任务没完成，饭也吃不下，觉也睡不着。这股子革命干劲，就是来源于伟大的毛泽东思想。当时，大家都非常清楚地认识到，帝国主义封锁我们，修正主义卡我们的脖子，毛主席教导我们要自力更生，奋发图强，我们一定要听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。我们打的首先是一场政治仗、志气仗！只有打胜这场政治仗、志气仗，才能打胜拿下油田这场生产仗、经济仗。我们下定决心，要给中国人民争气，拚死也要把油运出去。我们就是凭着这一股革命精神把一切困难踩在脚下，不仅保证了第一列车原油按期外运，而且拿下了大庆油田，保证了社会主义建设的需要，支援了世界人民革命。
    我们这一切成绩，都归功于毛泽东思想。我们大庆就是靠“两论”起家的。我们一时一刻也离不开毛泽东思想。有了它，我们就有方向，有干劲，有力量；有了它，我们刀山火海也敢上，天大的困难也要踩在脚下。我们大庆人永远忠于毛泽东思想，我们一定要把大庆油田办成毛泽东思想的大学校。孙冶方，你胆敢用“利润挂帅”、“钞票挂帅”的修正主义谬论，来反对毛主席关于政治是灵魂是统帅，政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线的伟大指示，我们决不答应，一定要把你斗臭，斗倒，斗垮！
