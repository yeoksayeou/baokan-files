The decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally directed by Chairman Mao, has pointed out the correct path to victory, corrected the erroneous line, and reversed the wrong direction.

After the Central Committee of the Party issued this decision, people's spirits were invigorated, and their fighting spirit soared. A new high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has begun.

The surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is sweeping away all obstacles. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "A clock that is not struck does not ring. A table that is not moved does not walk," and "Where the broom does not reach, the dust will not run away by itself." Those who stubbornly take the capitalist road will inevitably use various means and methods to resist the Sixteen Points, suppress the mass movement, and sabotage the Cultural Revolution. Apart from continuing to instigate students to fight against students, they also incite a small number of workers and peasants to fight against students, in order to shift the target of the struggle.

Those who take the capitalist road absurdly equate the leadership of their own units with the Central Committee of the Party and the entire Party. They exploit the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers' love for the Party and the fact that some masses do not know the truth, raising slogans such as "defending the Party committee of this region or department." If revolutionary students criticize them and rise up to rebel against them, they are labeled as "anti-Party," "anti-Party Central Committee," and "counter-revolutionaries." In some places, a small number of workers, peasants, and cadres have been deceived and misled to participate in the struggle against revolutionary students.

Using such slogans to incite some workers and peasants to struggle against revolutionary students is extremely reactionary and completely contrary to the Party's line.

Any Party organization in any region or unit must unconditionally follow the mass line, accept supervision and criticism from the masses, and must not refuse or suppress criticism from the masses under any pretext. It is absolutely not allowed to label those who criticize them as "anti-Party," "anti-Party Central Committee" "counter-revolutionaries." The Party Central Committee is the Party Central Committee. A Party organization in a region or unit is a Party organization in that region or unit. If a Party organization in any region or unit goes against the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong and against Mao Zedong Thought, why can it not be criticized? Why can it not be opposed? Why is it called "anti-Party," "anti-Party Central Committee," and "counter-revolutionary" as soon as someone criticizes it?

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers must not listen to the nonsense of those who take the capitalist road.

It is a great thing for revolutionary students to rise up in revolution and oppose those who take the capitalist road. Posting big-character posters is a good thing, speaking out, debating, and holding great debates are good things. They have the right to march and demonstrate in the streets, to hold meetings, to associate freely, to speak freely, and to publish freely. They dare to use Mao Zedong Thought to criticize the mistakes of the Party committees at their units and higher levels, which is precisely what can correct the leadership of those Party committees. As for those who are stubborn and unrepentant, even if they collapse, it is no big deal; it is also a good thing.

Revolutionary students organizing "Red Guards," "Red Flag Combat Teams," and other revolutionary organizations are legal organizations under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Their actions are revolutionary actions and legal actions. Anyone who opposes the revolutionary actions of revolutionary students directly goes against Chairman Mao's teachings and the decision of the Party Central Committee.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are the main force of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the strong backing of revolutionary students. We must firmly stand on the side of revolutionary students and give them the most enthusiastic and resolute support for their revolutionary actions.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers listen to the Party the most, listen to Chairman Mao the most, and support Mao Zedong Thought the most. The Party Central Committee's decision on the Sixteen Points is the latest embodiment of Mao Zedong Thought. All erroneous leadership that goes against the Sixteen Points and harms the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution must be resolutely resisted and opposed.

In the struggle, revolutionary students may have some shortcomings. We must see that their overall direction is correct and support them wholeheartedly, help them, and believe that they will be able to distinguish right from wrong in the struggle and know what to do and what not to do. We believe that they will become stronger and more daring and skilled in revolution through the struggle.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and revolutionary students must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite closely, and keep their eyes open. They must not be provoked or deceived by bad elements. Workers, peasants, soldiers, and people's police, due to their different situations and positions, may not understand the situation in schools and may not know the truth, so they should not participate in school debates.

Our great Party, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, has always trusted and relied on the masses. Similarly, the broad masses of the people, based on their own experiences, believe that they must trust and rely on the Party's leadership to completely liberate themselves. It is precisely because of this that the Party and the masses are heart to heart. No matter what twists and turns or storms there are, our Party and the masses will surely sweep away all ghosts and monsters, overthrow those in power who take the capitalist road, and achieve great victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

### 工农兵要坚决支持革命学生

    工农兵要坚决支持革命学生
    毛主席亲自主持制定的关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定，指明了胜利前进的正确道路，纠正了错误路线，扭转了错误方向。
    党中央这个决定发表后，人心振奋，斗志昂扬。无产阶级文化大革命的又一个新高潮开始了。
    无产阶级文化大革命的洪流，正在冲击着种种阻力。毛泽东同志说，“钟不敲是不响的。桌子不搬是不走的”，“扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉”。那些顽固地走资本主义道路的当权派，必然会采取种种办法，种种手段，抵抗十六条，压制群众运动，破坏文化大革命。他们除了继续挑动学生斗学生以外，还煽动少数工人农民斗学生，来转移斗争的目标。
    那些走资本主义道路的顽固派，荒谬地把自己本单位的领导，同党中央，同整个党等同起来。他们利用广大工农兵群众对党的热爱，利用一些群众不明真相，提出什么保卫本地区、本部门的党委的口号，如有革命学生批评他们，起来造他们的反，就被说成是什么“反党”，“反党中央”，说成是什么“反革命”。有的地方，有少数工人农民和机关干部受了蒙蔽和欺骗，参加了对革命学生的斗争。
    用这种口号煽动一些工人农民去斗争革命学生的做法，是极端反动的，是完全违背党的路线的。
    任何一个地区，任何一个单位的党组织，都必须无条件地走群众路线，接受群众的监督和批评，决不允许以任何借口拒绝和压制群众的批评，更绝对不允许把批评自己的群众打成“反党”，“反党中央”的“反革命分子”。党中央就是党中央。一个地区，一个单位的党组织，就是一个地区，一个单位的党组织。任何一个地区，一个单位的党组织，如果违背了以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的正确领导，违背了毛泽东思想，为什么批评不得？为什么反对不得？为什么人家一批评，就叫做“反党”，“反党中央”，“反革命”？
    广大工农兵群众，决不要听那些走资本主义道路的老爷们的胡说。
    广大革命学生起来闹革命，反对走资本主义道路的老爷们，是件大好事。他们贴大字报，是好事，大鸣、大放、大辩论，是好事。他们有上街游行示威的权利，有集会、结社、言论、出版的权利。他们敢于用毛泽东思想批评本单位党委和上级党委的错误，正好可以端正那些党委的领导。至于那些死顽固，死不悔改的，垮了也没有什么了不起，也是好事。
    革命的学生们组织“红卫兵”、“红旗战斗小组”等等革命组织，是无产阶级专政下的合法的组织。他们的行动，是革命的行动，是合法的行动。谁要反对革命学生的革命行动，就直接违背了毛主席的教导，违背了党中央的决定。
    广大工农兵群众，是无产阶级文化大革命的主力军，是革命学生的强大后盾。我们一定要坚定地站在革命学生一边，最热烈最坚决地支持革命学生的革命行动。
    广大工农兵群众，最听党的话，最听毛主席的话，最拥护毛泽东思想。党中央决定的十六条，是毛泽东思想的最新的体现。一切违背十六条的，危害无产阶级文化大革命的错误领导，都要坚决抵制，坚决反对。
    革命学生在斗争中，也可能有一些缺点。我们一定要看到他们大方向是正确的，应当满腔热情地支持他们，帮助他们，相信他们会在斗争当中，自己能够分清哪些是对的，哪些是不对的，应当怎样做，不应当怎样做。相信他们在斗争中会锻炼得更加坚强，更加敢于革命，善于革命。
    广大工农兵群众，广大革命学生，要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧密地团结起来，擦亮眼睛，千万不要受坏人的挑拨，千万不要上坏人的当。工人，农民，解放军战士，人民警察，由于所处情况不同，岗位不同，他们可能不了解那里学校的情况，不明真相，就不要去参加学校的辩论。
    我们伟大的党，用毛泽东思想武装起来的党，一直是信任人民群众，依靠人民群众。同样的，广大人民群众，根据自己的切身经验认为，必须信任党的领导，依靠党的领导，才能完全解放自己。正是因为这样，党和人民群众心连心，不论有什么曲折，有什么风波，我们的党和人民群众，终归会横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，斗垮那些走资本主义道路的当权派，取得无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。
