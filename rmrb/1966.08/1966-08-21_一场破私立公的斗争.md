In Guangxi's Cangwu County, Changzhou Commune's Gufeng Production Brigade, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, launched a mass debate on breaking private ownership and establishing public ownership. This struggle to promote the new and eliminate the old has washed away the decaying thoughts and customs of the landlord and bourgeoisie, greatly changing the spiritual face of the commune members.

The brigade party branch collected dozens of harmful old sayings from the masses, such as: "Cunning and deceitful, steam in the morning and fry in the evening; loyal and upright, ultimately begging for food," "Which snail doesn't eat mud, which person isn't selfish," and so on. They handed these "proverbs" to the masses for debate, using Chairman Mao's works like "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People" as weapons for criticism. Poor and lower-middle peasants found relevant quotations from Chairman Mao's works and, combining them with their own actual situations, refuted these fallacies that represent the interests of the landlord and bourgeoisie, leaving them with no defense. Brigade poor peasants' association chairman Zhong Weichang said: "We poor and lower-middle peasants have always been loyal and upright. Only landlords and capitalists are cunning and deceitful. Among us, there were indeed many who begged for food in the old society, but that was the result of being oppressed and exploited by the landlord class. The landlord class wants to use the ghostly talk of 'loyal and upright' and 'cunning and deceitful' to cover up the essence of class exploitation, but we will not be fooled. After liberation, under Chairman Mao's leadership, we have taken the socialist road, and our lives have continuously improved. No one begs for food anymore. This was unimaginable in the old society. We have overthrown the landlord and bourgeoisie's rule, and no matter how cunning and deceitful they are, they cannot live off exploitation anymore." Gufeng First Team's poor peasant Mo Xiuli said: "Before liberation, my family rented a plot of land from a landlord, but when the crops were ripe, the landlord did not let us harvest. My family of nine siblings, four died from hunger and disease. They say: 'Without sudden wealth, one cannot become rich.' The fruits of our hard work year-round became the 'sudden wealth' for the landlords to get rich; their 'steaming in the morning and frying in the evening' is the blood and sweat of us poor and lower-middle peasants! Now, the landlord class has been overthrown by us, but the exploitative ideology still exists. We must expose and uproot it."

When discussing the relationship between collective and individual interests, they criticized the fallacy of "a ten-zhang-long dragon boat not occupying an inch for oneself." Poor and lower-middle peasants said: "The large collective is our backbone. Without it, we would not have today's happy life. We must cherish the collective, even if it is just 'an inch' of the collective. Only when everyone cherishes the collective's 'inch' can there be a collective ten-zhang-long dragon boat. If we do not cherish this 'inch,' we would damage everyone's nine hundred and ninety-nine inches."

In the debate on "what kind of person to be," poor and lower-middle peasants said: The exploitative class advocates the idea of "if one does not seek personal gain, one will be punished by heaven and earth," which is an extremely selfish and self-serving ideology. We must resolutely oppose it. We must be people who "seek no personal gain but dedicate themselves to the people," serving the people wholeheartedly. Gufeng First Team's seventy-five-year-old old woman Qiu Aiqun said: "We must read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teachings to be 'a person of noble character, a person of integrity, a person of morality, a person free from vulgar interests, a person beneficial to the people.' I will educate my son and grandson to be such honest people and must criticize all the bad words of the exploitative class."

Through the debate, the commune members realized that if they were influenced by the decaying thoughts of the landlord and bourgeoisie and did not resist, they would gradually fall into the exploitative class's pit, "invite ghosts into the house," and make capitalism revive, returning to the bitter depths of the old society. Therefore, they must resolutely criticize the thoughts of the bourgeoisie and landlord class, break private ownership and establish public ownership, transform their worldview, and thoroughly uproot the roots of revisionism.

Following this, the party branch erected ten "public" red banners throughout the brigade. Hechuan Second Team's militia deputy platoon leader Li Shude was one of the first to raise a red banner. He actively learns and applies Chairman Mao's works, always acts for the public good, and bravely shoulders heavy responsibilities, earning praise from the masses and being evaluated as a model in studying Chairman Mao's works. He saw a landlord singing yellow and vulgar old operas, corrupting the youth, so he led the masses to struggle against this landlord and organized the youth to study Chairman Mao's works, read the Red Book, and sing red songs, reclaiming the cultural battlefield for the proletariat. On a rainy night, he was concerned about the reservoir and went to inspect it in the rain. Indeed, he found a place with a risk of collapse and immediately repaired it, preventing a serious loss.

Now, every household in Gufeng Brigade hangs Chairman Mao's portrait. Many commune members hang Chairman Mao's portrait not only in the main hall but also in the bedroom. They say: "This way, we can see Chairman Mao at all times and always remember his teachings." Throughout the brigade, a social atmosphere of putting "public" first has emerged. Good deeds and good people are increasing. This spiritual power is rapidly manifesting itself in practice.

    一场破私立公的斗争
    谢式丘
    广西苍梧县长洲公社古凤大队，用毛泽东思想作武器，开展了一次群众性的破私立公的大辩论。这场兴无灭资的斗争，涤荡着腐朽的地主资产阶级的旧思想、旧风俗，使社员群众的精神面貌发生了极大的变化。
    大队党支部在群众中，搜集了几十条有毒的老俗话，例如：“奸奸狡狡，朝蒸晚炒；忠忠直直，终须乞食”、“哪个田螺不吃泥，哪个人不自私”，等等。他们把这些“格言”交给群众，进行辩论，用毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等著作的基本观点作武器，进行批判。贫农下中农从毛主席著作中，找出对口语录，结合本队本村本人的实际，把那些代表地主资产阶级利益的谬论驳得体无完肤。大队贫协主席钟伟昌说：“我们贫农下中农历来是忠忠直直的，只有地主、资本家才是奸奸狡狡的坏人。我们当中确有不少人在旧社会乞过食，但那是受地主阶级压迫剥削的结果。地主阶级想利用什么‘忠忠直直’、‘奸奸狡狡’的鬼话，来掩盖阶级剥削实质，我们绝不受骗。解放后，我们在毛主席的领导下，走社会主义道路，生活不断得到改善，再也没有人乞食了。这在旧社会是作梦也想不到的。我们专了地主资产阶级的政，他们再‘奸奸狡狡’，想过剥削日子，是办不到的。”古凤一队的贫农莫秀丽说：“解放前，我家租种地主的一块田，禾熟时地主却不让我们收割。我家九个兄妹，连饿带病死了四个。他们说：‘人无横财不富’，我们常年辛苦劳动来的果实，都变成了地主发家的‘横财’；他们‘朝蒸晚炒’的，就是我们贫下中农的血汗啊！现在，地主阶级被我们打倒了，但是剥削思想还存在，我们一定要把它斗臭，连根挖掉。”
    在谈到集体利益和个人利益的关系时，他们对“十丈龙船自己不占一寸”的谬论进行了批判。贫下中农说：“十丈龙船的大集体是我们的靠山，没有它，就没有今天的幸福生活。我们要爱护集体，哪怕是集体的‘一寸’也要爱护。只有大家都爱护集体的‘一寸’，才能有集体的十丈龙船。如果不爱护这‘一寸’，那就损害了大家的九百九十九寸。”
    在辩论“做什么样的人”时，贫下中农说：剥削阶级宣扬的“人不为己，天诛地灭”的思想，是极端自私自利的思想，我们要坚决反对。我们一定要做“毫不利己专门利人”的人，全心全意为人民服务。古凤一队七十五岁的老太婆仇爱群说：“我们就是要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，坚决按照毛主席的教导去做‘一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。’我一定教育我的儿子和孙子都要老老实实地做这样的人，一定要批判一切剥削阶级的坏话。”
    通过辩论，社员群众认识到，如果受到地主资产阶级腐朽思想的影响，不加抵制，就会一步步滚到剥削阶级的泥坑中去，“引鬼入堂”，使资本主义复辟，重新回到旧社会的苦难深渊。所以，要坚决批判资产阶级、地主阶级的思想，破私立公，改造世界观，彻底挖掉修正主义的根子。
    接着，党支部又在全大队树起了十面“公”字红旗。河村二队民兵副营长李树德，是最先树起的一面红旗。他活学活用毛主席著作，处处为公，勇于挑重担，受到群众赞扬，被评为学习毛主席著作的标兵。他看到一个地主唱黄色古戏，腐蚀青年，便领导群众对这个地主进行了斗争，又组织青年学习毛主席著作，读红书，唱红歌，夺回了无产阶级的文化阵地。一个大雨倾盆的深夜，他担心水库发生问题，便冒雨巡视。果然，他发现一处有崩塌危险，便立刻堵好，避免了一次严重的损失。
    现在，古凤大队家家户户都挂着毛主席的画像。不少社员把毛主席的像不仅挂在堂屋里，也挂在卧房里。他们说：“这样可以时时看见毛主席，时时记起他老人家的教导。”在全大队，出现了一个“公”字当头的社会风气。好人好事越来越多。这种精神威力正迅速地在实践中充分表现出来。
