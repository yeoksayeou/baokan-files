The biggest "profit obsession"

On September 18, 1963, Sun Yefang presented the report "Profit Indicator in the Management System of Socialist Planned Economy" (hereinafter referred to as the "Profit Report"). Sun Yefang, who often boasts, "I like to fight bare-chested," this time claimed that he wrote this report not only to implement the Party Central Committee's instructions on reversing losses and increasing profits but also to better oppose modern revisionism. Now, we expose his various activities before and after writing this report to see his true intentions.

Sun Yefang has long been driven by greed. As early as August 1956, he compared profit to a cow's nose, claiming that as long as you hold it, the entire national economy will follow.

In September 1962, Liberman proposed the so-called "Plan, Profit, Bonus" suggestion, advocating the revisionist fallacy of "profit-first." Our Party immediately saw through this as an economic program for the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union. Comrades wrote articles criticizing Liberman's fallacies. Sun Yefang not only defended Liberman, saying that the critical articles were "eclecticism" and "not in accordance with the original intention," but also directed his attacks at the Party Central Committee. He said, "Instructions were issued to emphasize increasing profits and reversing losses, but now profits are being criticized. Theory and practice are inconsistent, words and deeds are inconsistent." This is a deliberate slander and defamation!

On September 12, 1963, Sun Yefang sent the "Profit Report" from Dalian to Beijing, along with a letter he wrote. In the letter, he praised Liberman's proposal to the skies, saying, "I don't know where the wind blew from, saying that Liberman's proposal negates the planned economy. This criticism is purely logical reasoning without factual basis. I have read Liberman's proposal several times and feel that Liberman has proposed a complete planning system."

In October 1963, at the fourth enlarged meeting of the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences, Sun Yefang once again put forward his fallacy of "profit-first," and even publicly declared in a small group meeting, "I am more thorough than Liberman," shouting, "Anti-revisionism cannot be exaggerated."

To promote his fallacy of "profit-first," Sun Yefang also spread rumors. At the beginning of the "Profit Report," he maliciously said, "'Profit' has become a taboo for some economists." To "prove" his point, he instructed his confidants to specially collect so-called "specific examples" of people who were afraid to touch the profit issue as an appendix. This appendix is a complete fabrication of distorted facts. Based on this appendix, Sun Yefang, with a shocking tone, described how some economists were afraid of the "profit" category, as if they were "afraid of ghosts like those who believe in ghosts." He also slandered that "academic conferences regarded the issue of enterprise profits as a dangerous topic and refused to discuss it."

With the mask torn off, we see that Sun Yefang is the biggest revisionist "profit obsession."

### 最大的“利润迷”

　　最大的“利润迷”
    一九六三年九月十八日，孙冶方抛出了《社会主义计划经济管理体制中的利润指标》的报告（简称《利润报告》）。经常叫嚣“我就喜欢赤膊上阵”的孙冶方，这次却说什么他写这个报告不仅是为了贯彻党中央关于扭转亏损、增加盈利的指示，而且是为了更好地反对现代修正主义。现在我们揭露他写这一报告前后的种种活动，看他居心何在。
    孙冶方利欲熏心，由来已久。早在一九五六年八月，他就把利润比作牛鼻子，声称只要牵着它，就能使整个国民经济的牛跟着跑。
    一九六二年九月，利别尔曼提出了所谓《计划·利润·奖金》的建议，鼓吹“利润挂帅”的修正主义谬论。我们党立即看透了这是一个在苏联复辟资本主义的经济纲领，有同志写了文章批判利别尔曼的谬论。孙冶方不仅为利别尔曼辩护，说什么批判的文章是“折衷主义”、“不符合原意”，而且把攻击的矛头直接指向党中央。他说：“发了指示强调增加利润，扭转亏损，现在又批判利润，理论和实践不一致，言行不一。”这完全是蓄意的污蔑和诽谤！
    一九六三年九月十二日，孙冶方把《利润报告》从大连寄到北京，附有他写的一封信。他在信中把利别尔曼的建议捧上了天，说什么：“不知从什么地方吹来了一股风，说利别尔曼的建议否定了计划经济，这种批判完全是出于逻辑推理，没有事实根据。我再三看了利别尔曼的建议，觉得利别尔曼提出了一个完整的计划体系。”
    一九六三年十月，在哲学社会科学部召开的第四次扩大会议上，孙冶方再度抛出了他的“利润挂帅”的谬论，而且在小组会上公然宣称“我比利别尔曼还彻底”，叫嚷“反修不能扩大化”。
    孙冶方为了推销他的“利润挂帅”的谬论，还极尽造谣之能事。他在《利润报告》中一开头就别有用心地说：“‘利润’竟成了一些经济学者的忌讳。”为了“证明”他的观点，他还指使他的亲信，专门搜集所谓害怕接触利润问题的“具体事例”作为附件。这个附件根本是肆意歪曲事实的捏造。而孙冶方又在这个附件的基础上，以骇人听闻的笔调，描绘有些经济学家害怕“利润”范畴，象“信鬼的人怕鬼那样厉害”。他还污蔑“学术会议把企业赢利问题视作危险题目而拒绝讨论”。
    外衣剥掉了，我们看清了孙冶方是个最大的修正主义“利润迷”。
