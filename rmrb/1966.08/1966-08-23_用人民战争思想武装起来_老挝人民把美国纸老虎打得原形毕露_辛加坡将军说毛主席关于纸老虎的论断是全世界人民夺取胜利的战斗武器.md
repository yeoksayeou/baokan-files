The Lao people, armed with the thought of people's war, have exposed the true nature of the American paper tiger on the battlefield in Laos, confirming Chairman Mao's brilliant thesis that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers.

General Singkapo, representative of the Lao People's Liberation Army High Command, recently said in a speech: "Chairman Mao Zedong's brilliant thesis that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers is not only a weapon for the Chinese people to achieve victory, but also a weapon for the Lao people and all the people of the world to achieve victory." The general pointed out that the Lao people have long accepted Chairman Mao's brilliant thesis, and their struggle has fully proven that the seemingly powerful American imperialism and the Lao reactionaries are nothing to be afraid of.

Since May 1964, American imperialism has blatantly dispatched its air force to bomb the liberated areas of Laos to assist the Lao reactionaries in their attacks. In the more than two years since the direct involvement of the U.S. Air Force, the Lao patriotic military and people have shot down more than 400 American planes. Just in the first half of this year, the Lao patriotic military and people shot down 158 American planes and damaged 126. Not only have the regular troops achieved the brilliant feat of shooting down American planes with rifles and light weapons, but some guerrilla units have also shot down American planes with rifles.

The pseudo-army, commanded by American officers and relying on "air superiority" and "artillery superiority," has launched multiple attacks and encroachments on the liberated areas of Laos, all of which have ended in failure. American imperialism and the Lao reactionaries have fallen into the sea of fire of the Lao people's war.

The Lao patriotic military and people strategically despise the enemy but tactically take the enemy seriously. During the enemy's dry-season offensive from last December to this April, they defeated the well-equipped reactionary army of Laos, commanded by American officers and directly supported by the U.S. Air Force and Thai artillery, in battles from the lower Laos region of Mong Bat to the upper Laos region of Tala Nakone. They have continuously annihilated batches of enemies and created many brilliant achievements.

The guerrilla warfare movement of the Lao people is flourishing. From the mountains to the plains, from the liberated areas to the enemy-occupied areas, they have gone from sporadic attacks on the enemy to coordinating with the regular troops to annihilate large groups of enemies, making the enemy suffer everywhere and panic.

The Lao patriotic military and people have achieved a great situation by persisting in people's war. The Lao patriotic forces have liberated two-thirds of the country and half of the population, consolidating and expanding the liberated areas. In the past two years, they have annihilated more than 23,000 American and puppet troops, and in the dry-season offensive launched from last December to this April, they annihilated more than 5,000 enemies. Under the strong blows of the Lao patriotic military and people, mutinies have broken out in the Lao reactionary army, and more and more soldiers are fleeing the war and surrendering.

    用人民战争思想武装起来
    老挝人民把美国纸老虎打得原形毕露
    辛加坡将军说毛主席关于纸老虎的论断是全世界人民夺取胜利的战斗武器
    据新华社康开二十一日电　本社记者报道：用人民战争思想武装起来的老挝人民，在老挝战场上把美帝国主义这只纸老虎打得原形毕露，证实了毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的光辉论断。
    老挝人民解放军最高指挥部代表辛加坡将军在最近发表的一次谈话中说：“毛泽东主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断，不仅是中国人民取得胜利的武器，也是老挝人民和全世界人民夺取胜利的战斗武器。”这位将军指出，老挝人民很早就接受了毛主席的这一英明论断，他们走过的斗争道路充分证明：貌似强大的美帝国主义和老挝反动派并没有什么可怕的。
    从一九六四年五月以来，美帝国主义悍然直接出动空军轰炸老挝解放区，来配合老挝反动派的进攻。老挝爱国军民在美国空军直接参战后的两年多的时间中，已经打落了四百多架美国飞机。仅仅在今年上半年，老挝爱国军民共打落美国飞机一百五十八架，打伤一百二十六架。不仅正规部队创造了用步枪和轻武器打落美国飞机的光辉战绩，而且好些民兵游击队也用步枪打下了美国飞机。
    美国军官指挥的伪军依靠“空中优势”、“炮火优势”的配合，向老挝解放区发动的多次进攻和蚕食也接连遭到了失败。美帝国主义和老挝反动派已经陷入老挝人民战争的火海中。
    老挝爱国军民在战略上藐视敌人，在战术上重视敌人。在从去年十二月到今年四月敌人的旱季进攻中，他们在从下寮的芒球方钉到上寮的塔拉拿康等战场上，打垮了在美国空军和泰国炮兵直接配合下由美国指挥官指挥的装备“精良”的老挝反动军队，接连地歼灭一批又一批的敌人，创造了许多光辉的战绩。
    老挝人民的游击战争运动正在日益蓬勃地发展。从山区到平原，从解放区到敌占区，他们从零星地打击敌人，到配合正规部队歼灭成股的敌人，使敌人到处挨打，惊慌万状。
    老挝爱国军民坚持人民战争，已经打出了一片大好形势。老挝爱国部队已经解放三分之二的国土和二分之一的人口，巩固和扩大了解放区。他们在两年来歼灭了美伪军两万三千多名，在从去年十二月到今年四月发动的旱季攻势中，就歼敌五千多名。在老挝爱国军民的强有力的打击下，老挝反动军队里兵变蜂起，士兵厌战逃亡和起义投诚的越来越多。
