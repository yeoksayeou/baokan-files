The U.S. aggressors in South Vietnam are deeply mired in the people's war. Despite repeated troop increases, the Johnson administration is still unable to solve the problem of insufficient manpower on the battlefield.

The main reason for the U.S.'s severe manpower shortage in South Vietnam is that ninety percent of its forces are forced to be used for logistical supply, guarding military outposts, and supply lines.

Casualties among U.S. invasion forces continue to rise, and replacing troops is becoming increasingly difficult. The Washington Post revealed on August 1 that the U.S. Marine Corps in South Vietnam has suffered heavy casualties and is facing difficulties in replacements. It reported: "The Marine Corps has paid a heavy price in Vietnam," "some units have suffered severe losses," "a battalion of 1,100 men is down to 600, a company of 200 is down to 125." It also pointed out: "Many Marine companies and battalions are suffering from the double blow of battlefield casualties and the rotation of experienced old soldiers," thus "their combat effectiveness is not as strong as when they were at full strength."

In an attempt to alleviate this desperate situation, the U.S. Department of Defense recently formulated a plan to "massively increase troops in Vietnam," boasting that "the U.S. will provide as many personnel and firepower as needed on the battlefield." According to the New York Times, this troop increase plan is to increase U.S. forces in South Vietnam to nearly 400,000 by the end of this year and to 500,000 in 1967.

However, the Johnson administration's troop increase plan faces the great difficulty of severe manpower shortages at home. New York Times military correspondent Baldwin pointed out on July 17 that how many troops the U.S. will have in Vietnam in 1967 "is still a mystery," because "trained personnel cannot be conjured up like a magician's rabbit from a hat." Senator Stennis, chairman of the Senate Preparedness Subcommittee, put it more clearly, saying that manpower shortages are the U.S.'s "approaching very serious problem." Although the U.S. can use machines to speed up the production of guns, cannons, and bullets, it "cannot use machines to produce and train soldiers."

As early as February this year, some U.S. bourgeois newspapers were already alarmingly calling out that "almost all the combat-ready, support, and supply troops in the U.S. have been sent to Vietnam," and "the U.S. armed forces almost have no trained, ready-to-deploy troops to call upon." In order to gather cannon fodder for the invasion of Vietnam, the Johnson administration has had to intensify the training of new recruits and expand the scope of conscription at home, while also changing the rotation system for the U.S. Army in Vietnam three times. The U.S. has also called up 40,000 troops from Western Europe for emergency use. The situation of U.S. manpower exhaustion has thus become even more severe. Recently, some high-ranking officials of the U.S. Department of Defense testified before Congress that the "various components of the U.S. regular army are 'decreasing in number,' and if another emergency occurs, it will be necessary to call up reservists." The Senate Defense Subcommittee also issued an urgent appeal stating that the U.S. Tactical Air Command is in a state of very poor preparedness, and if reservists are not called up, it will not be able to meet the greater demands of Vietnam.

In this situation, the U.S. Senate hastily passed an amendment on August 17 to call up reservists for active duty, attempting to authorize the Johnson administration to call up part of the reserves to join the military, in order to solve the U.S.'s severe manpower shortage problem. This shows how desperate the Johnson administration is in gathering cannon fodder to increase troops in South Vietnam.

    伤亡惨重　兵员奇缺　补充困难
    美国在南越兵力不足穷于应付
    美国侵略者在南越深深陷入了人民战争的海洋。约翰逊政府尽管一再增兵，还是无法解决战场上兵力不足的问题。
    美国在南越深感兵力不足的主要原因是，它的百分之九十的兵力都被迫用来担任后勤供应，守卫军事据点和供应线。
    美国侵略军伤亡不断激增，补充兵员大感困难。《华盛顿邮报》八月一日透露美国海军陆战队在南越伤亡惨重和补充困难的情况说：海军陆战队“在越南执行任务时付出的牺牲太大了”，“某些部队损失惨重”，“一千一百人的营剩下了六百人，二百人的连剩下了一百二十五人”。它还指出：“海军陆战队的许多连和营，受到战场伤亡和把有经验的老兵轮换掉这种双重影响的打击”，因而“他们的战斗力没有像满员时那样强”。
    美国国防部为了改善这种捉襟见肘的窘况，不久以前又制订了一项“大量增兵越南的计划”，扬言“美国在战场上的指挥要多少人员和火力就给多少”。据《纽约时报》透露，这项增兵计划是：今年年底以前使在南越的美军增加到近四十万人，一九六七年再增加到五十万人。
    但是，约翰逊政府的增兵计划，遇到了国内兵员奇缺的极大困难。《纽约时报》军事记者鲍德温七月十七日指出，美国一九六七年在越南究竟能有多少兵力“还是个谜”，因为美国的“训练有素的人员不可能像魔术家的兔子那样从帽子里变出来”。美国参议院战备小组委员会主席斯坦尼斯讲得更清楚，他说，兵力不足是美国的“正在逼近的非常严重的问题”。美国虽然能够用机器加紧制造枪炮子弹，但是却“不能够用机器制造士兵并训练他们”。
    早在今年二月，美国一些资产阶级报刊就纷纷惊呼，“几乎所有在美国的作好准备的作战、支援和供应部队，都已经投入越南”，“美国的武装部队几乎已经没有什么训练有素的、能整装待命的部队能调用了”。约翰逊政府为了搜罗侵越炮灰，不得不在国内加紧训练新兵，扩大征兵范围，同时三次改变陆军在越南服役的轮换制度。美国还抽调了驻西欧的四万美军应急。美国兵源枯竭的情况就这样变得更为严重。不久前，美国国防部的一些高级官员在国会作证时说：美国“正规部队的各个组成部分‘人数越来越小’，如果再发生紧急事件，就不得不征召后备役人员”。美国参议院的国防小组委员会也发出紧急呼吁说：美国的战术空军司令部正处于准备十分不足的状态，如不征召空军后备役的话，就无法满足越南更大的需求。
    在这种情况下，美国参议院八月十七日匆忙通过了一项征召后备队服现役的修正案，力图授权约翰逊政府，使它得以征召一部分后备队入伍，以解决美国兵员严重不足的问题。由此可见，约翰逊政府在搜罗炮灰增兵南越的问题上，如何狼狈。（附图片）
