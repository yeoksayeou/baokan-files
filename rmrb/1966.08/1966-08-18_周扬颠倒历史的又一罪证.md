Zhou Yang's Another Piece of Evidence of Distorting History

On January 18, 1960, Zhou Yang, in the name of the Propaganda Department, convened a meeting to "discuss theoretical and critical work." At this meeting, Zhou Yang vaguely talked about "summarizing experiences" and "summarizing legacies," and so on. Then, his true intentions were revealed. His so-called "summarizing experiences" and "summarizing legacies" were actually to concentrate efforts on summarizing the experiences of the so-called literature of the 1930s, to cover up the crimes of his black gang and build monuments for them.

Upon the master's command, the bourgeois representatives of the *Literary Gazette* immediately ordered the editorial department to organize articles. Soon, they received the article "Inheriting and Carrying Forward the Fighting Tradition of the Chinese Left-Wing Writers' League." The bourgeois representatives of the *Literary Gazette* were overjoyed and decided to publish it as the lead article, repeatedly instructing that it should be sent to Zhou Yang for review. Zhou Yang received this piece, as if he had found a treasure, personally revised it, and finally finalized the draft. Under the pretext of commemorating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the "Left-Wing Writers' League," it was published in the fourth issue of the *Literary Gazette* in 1960.

This poisoned arrow blatantly distorted the history of the literary movement in the 1930s, claiming that the bourgeois and revisionist literary line represented by Zhou Yang was the Marxist-Leninist literary line. It claimed that the bourgeois slogan "National Defense Literature," formulated by Zhou Yang according to the Wang Ming line, was a "completely" correct proletarian slogan. It even claimed that the relationship between literature and politics, and the relationship between literature and the working masses, had been well resolved in the 1930s.

This article shamelessly fabricated history for Zhou Yang and his gang. The article said: "The 'National Defense Literature' movement that unfolded in 1936 before and after the dissolution of the 'Left-Wing Writers' League' was, under the leadership of the underground party in Shanghai, an active response to the call of Comrade Mao Zedong, a 'broad and powerful literary movement,' which was 'completely in line with the spirit of the anti-Japanese united front' as indicated by Comrade Mao Zedong." However, this was too blatant and lacked "strategic" considerations. Thus, the cunning Zhou Yang changed the pen with a stroke, changing the "National Defense Literature" movement to the "literary movement centered on anti-Japanese and national salvation." In this way, he could deceive people and achieve his original purpose: turning the "National Defense Literature" slogan, which was a slogan of class capitulation, into a "completely" correct proletarian slogan, to counter Mao Zedong's stern criticism of Zhou Yang and his gang.

To find evidence for himself, Zhou Yang added a paragraph at the end of the article. He said that "under the conditions of the high tide of the anti-Japanese national movement at that time, it was completely necessary to launch and unite various literary writers to jointly fight against the Kuomintang for the freedom of speech and publication." The meaning was that at that time, he advocated "launching and uniting various literary writers," abolishing class struggle, and giving up the leadership of the proletariat, which was a correct and "completely necessary" line of capitulationism, while the proletarian slogan of "literature of national revolutionary war for the masses" proposed by Lu Xun was wrong, and Mao Zedong's criticism of Zhou Yang and his gang was also incorrect. Look, how sinister Zhou Yang's intentions were!

History cannot be falsified. No matter what means Zhou Yang uses to oppose Mao Zedong Thought, he will definitely end in complete failure!

### 周扬颠倒历史的又一罪证

　　周扬颠倒历史的又一罪证
    一九六○年一月十八日，周扬以中宣部的名义，召开了一个“讨论理论批评工作”的会议。在这个会上，周扬含含混混说了一阵什么“总结经验”啦，什么“总结遗产”啦，等等。接着，他的狐狸尾巴露出来了。原来他的所谓“总结经验”，“总结遗产”，就是要集中力量去总结所谓三十年代文艺的经验，为他这伙黑帮掩盖罪行和立传树碑。
    主子一声令下，《文艺报》的资产阶级代表人物立即责令编辑部四出组织文章，不久，就收到了《继承和发扬中国左翼作家联盟的战斗传统》这篇文章。《文艺报》的资产阶级代表人物欣喜若狂，决定刊登头条，并一再嘱咐要送给周扬看。周扬接到这篇东西，如获至宝，亲自动手修改，最后定稿，打着纪念“左联”成立三十周年的幌子，在一九六○年第四期《文艺报》上抛出来了。
    这支毒箭，露骨地颠倒了三十年代文艺运动的历史，把以周扬为代表的资产阶级、修正主义文艺路线，说成是马克思列宁主义的文艺路线，把周扬根据王明路线制定的“国防文学”这个资产阶级口号，说成是“完全”正确的无产阶级口号。甚至说，文艺与政治的关系，文艺与工农群众的关系等等，在三十年代已经很好地解决了。
    这篇文章为周扬一伙大吹大捧，无耻地伪造历史。文章说：“一九三六年在‘左联’解散前后展开的‘国防文学’运动，更是在上海地下党领导下，积极响应毛泽东同志的号召”的“一个广泛而有力的文学运动”，“是完全符合毛泽东同志所指示”的“抗日统一战线的精神的”。但是，这样说未免太露骨了，太没“策略性”了，于是，老奸巨滑的周扬挥笔一改，把“‘国防文学’运动”改成“以抗日救国为中心的文学运动”。这样，既可遮人耳目，又能达到原来的目的：把“国防文学”这个阶级投降主义的口号，变成“完全”正确的无产阶级口号，以对抗毛主席对周扬一伙的严正批判。
    为了替自己找论据，周扬还在文章的后面添上了一段。他说什么“在当时抗日民族运动高涨的条件下，发动和联合各派文艺作家共同向国民党展开一个争取言论、出版自由的斗争，是完全需要的。”意思就是说，那时他主张“发动和联合各派文艺作家”，取消阶级斗争，放弃无产阶级的领导地位的投降主义路线，是完全正确的，是“完全需要的”，而鲁迅提出来的“民族革命战争的大众文学”的无产阶级口号，却是错误的，毛主席对周扬一伙的批评，也是不正确的。请看，周扬的用心是多么的狠毒！
    历史是篡改不了的。不管周扬采取什么手段反对毛泽东思想，都一定要以彻底的失败告终！
