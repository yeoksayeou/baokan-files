A great, unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, has swept across the country like a storm, like lightning, from the revolutionary capital of the proletariat, Beijing, to every corner of the nation, flourishing and thriving.

It is heartening to see that in this great revolution, a large number of previously unknown revolutionary youth have become brave pioneers. They are bold, wise, and capable of both speaking and acting.

Big-character posters have become the powerful weapon of the young revolutionaries in their attacks on the open and hidden capital-roaders in power and all the monsters and demons. Their big-character posters, like sharp swords and daggers, have struck at the vital points of the enemy, wounding their most sensitive spots, boosting the morale of the revolutionaries, and crushing the arrogance of the enemy. Therefore, they have been warmly welcomed by the broad revolutionary masses, who have enthusiastically copied and spread them far and wide.

However, some people have found fault with such excellent big-character posters, shaking their heads in disapproval. Meanwhile, the counter-revolutionary revisionists and capital-roaders in power have ruthlessly suppressed these revolutionary youth, falsely labeling their revolutionary big-character posters as counter-revolutionary.

This journal has selected a few big-character posters to publish, allowing the broad masses of the people to judge for themselves.

We believe that these big-character posters are highly revolutionary and combative, bold and powerful, inspiring and invigorating. They truly embody the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. This is a magnificent poem of the proletarian cultural revolution. This is the crystallization of the genius and wisdom of revolutionary youth. This is the result of being nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought.

The young revolutionaries roar to the heavens: We want revolution, we want rebellion! Thunder roars, lightning flashes, the storm of the cultural revolution is swift and fierce, like Mount Tai pressing down, like surging waves. Those who follow it will survive, those who resist it will perish.

In the face of the young revolutionaries' revolutionary offensive, those capital-roaders in power feel that their doom is near and that they can no longer hold on. They distort right and wrong, confuse black and white, plot conspiracies, shoot dark arrows, spread rumors, and falsely accuse them of various crimes, persecuting them.

"You are counter-revolutionaries." The capital-roaders in power, who have appointed themselves as the embodiment of the Party, declare, "I am the Party." Whoever opposes them is against the Party, is a counter-revolutionary.

The revolutionary youth fear neither heaven nor earth, nor ghosts nor gods. They fear not even death, so why should they fear the label of "counter-revolutionary"? They know that their actions are revolutionary, and that the great leader Chairman Mao supports them. The great Mao Zedong Thought inspires them.

This proletarian cultural revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has opened their eyes, enlightened their minds, and made them realize: They must revolutionize, they must rebel, they must rebel against the bourgeoisie, against imperialism, against revisionism, against all monsters and demons, against all the ideology of the exploiting classes. They cheer: Let the flames of revolution burn more fiercely!

"You are causing trouble." Indeed, the revolutionary youth are here to cause trouble. They will use Mao Zedong Thought as the sharpest weapon to disrupt the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits, to disrupt the rule of the capital-roaders in power. If they do not do this, then what is revolution? The proletarian cultural revolution is to smash the old rules, old customs, and old order of the bourgeoisie, to sweep away the stables of capitalism and revisionism with a revolutionary broom.

"It's a mess." The revolutionary pioneers, using big-character posters and great debates, speak out, expose, and criticize, launching a fierce attack on the reactionary representatives of the bourgeoisie. The capital-roaders in power have been ruthlessly exposed, and the reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie have been sharply criticized. They have lost their prestige and face. Thus, they cry out, "It's a mess." Strangely, some comrades also join in the chaos. If you are a person with a clear revolutionary standpoint, step out and go among the masses to see for yourself, you will feel a kind of unprecedented exhilaration. The red little ghosts have overthrown the underworld, and with their iron rods, they have smashed the reactionary fortresses of the bourgeoisie, turning everything upside down. This is a grand festival for millions of people, an unprecedented spectacle.

"You are arrogant, you are naive." The young people, who are often ridiculed as "snot-nosed," dare to challenge and defy all the bourgeois "authorities." The revolutionary youth will use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to thoroughly criticize and transform the old world, to thoroughly eliminate the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits that have accumulated for thousands of years; to turn the entire old world upside down and create a new world according to Mao Zedong Thought. Is this arrogance? No, this is a lofty revolutionary ambition.

From ancient times, those who dared to rebel and innovate have mostly been "naive" young people. Once they grasp the truth, they despise the old fossils and declare war on them. However, the old fossils with "scholarship" always suppress them. But ultimately, it is the young people, who were once unknown, who emerge victorious.

More than a hundred years ago, two young people—Marx and Engels—wrote the epoch-making masterpiece "The Communist Manifesto." They declared war on the old world, proclaiming a thorough break with traditional ideas, making the reactionary ruling classes tremble before the communist revolution.

Our greatest leader, Chairman Mao, when he was in his twenties, edited "Xiangjiang Review" and published many brilliant revolutionary articles, proposing to overthrow the old world and make the nobles and capitalists tremble before us with a thorough revolutionary battle cry.

The revolutionary dialectic is ruthless. Those who represent the old forces seem to be invincible, but they cannot escape the punishment of the revolutionary dialectic. Those who represent the new forces, no matter how many difficulties and obstacles they encounter in the struggle, will ultimately defeat the old forces.

The great Mao Zedong Thought is like gentle rain. The revolutionary youth nurtured under Mao Zedong Thought are so lovely!

They listen most to Chairman Mao's words and love our great leader Chairman Mao the most.

They have a clear and firm political direction, and their revolutionary direction is always correct. They do not seek fame or wealth but wholeheartedly engage in revolution and wholeheartedly serve the people.

They are bold, daring to think, speak, act, and rebel. For the defense of Mao Zedong Thought and the victory of the proletarian cultural revolution, they dare to face knife mountains and fire seas, and their hearts will never change even if the seas dry up and the stones crumble. They are the kind of people who dare to "break through the net," not the kind of political mediocrities who are careful not to get their fingers burned by the revolutionary fire. They are the kind of people who dare to soar in the great revolutionary storm, not the kind who cower under the eaves.

They have clear distinctions between love and hate, with a red heart for the people and boundless love; they have deep hatred for the capital-roaders in power and the reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie.

They are full of revolutionary vigor, daring to hack through thorns and blaze new trails.

The source of their revolutionary thoughts and strength is the great Mao Zedong Thought.

Of course, their experience in struggle is still limited, and they inevitably have various shortcomings. However, in the great storms of revolutionary struggle, they will certainly further arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought and forge themselves into all-round and outstanding successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution.

They are the future and hope of the proletarian revolution. With such strong revolutionary successors, our great motherland will forever remain red.

Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao has always cared for the revolutionary youth like a loving father. Chairman Mao has great hopes for the revolutionary youth. Chairman Mao said:

"The world belongs to you, to us, but in the end, it belongs to you. You young people are full of vigor and in your prime, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Our hopes are placed on you."

The revolutionary youth will surely remember Chairman Mao's affectionate teachings and earnest hopes, and strive even harder to study and apply Chairman Mao's works and the Sixteen Points, daring not only to struggle but also to struggle wisely, uniting all forces that can be united, striking down a handful of the most reactionary rightists, and carrying the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end.

Under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary youth will surely grow rapidly in the great furnace of the proletarian cultural revolution.

New forces are invincible. The future belongs to the revolutionary youth.

We pay the highest respect to the revolutionary youth!

    向革命的青少年致敬
    《红旗》杂志评论员
    一场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，如暴风骤雨，如迅雷急电，从无产阶级的革命首都北京，向四面八方，向全国各地，蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来。
    令人非常高兴的是，在这场大革命中，一大批本来不出名的革命青少年成了勇敢的闯将。他们有魄力，有智慧，说得出，做得到。
    大字报，是小将们向那些公开的、隐蔽的走资本主义道路的当权派和一切牛鬼蛇神进攻的有力武器。他们的大字报，如利剑，如匕首，击中了敌人的要害，刺伤了敌人的痛处，长了革命者的志气，灭了敌人的威风。因此，受到了广大革命群众的热烈欢迎，争相传抄，不胫而走。
    但是，有一些人对这样好的大字报，却多方挑剔，摇头不已。而反革命的修正主义分子、走资本主义道路的当权派，则残酷无情地打击这批革命的青少年，把他们的革命大字报诬蔑为反革命的大字报。
    本刊特选几篇大字报，公之于世，让广大人民群众来作鉴定。
    我们认为，这些大字报，具有强烈的革命性和战斗性，魄力大，气势壮，读了令人心胸开阔，精神振奋。真是：笔力雄健，横扫千军威尚猛；文锋犀利，“刺破青天锷未残”。字里行间，处处洋溢着无产阶级的革命豪情。
    这是无产阶级文化大革命的壮丽诗篇。这是革命青少年的天才和智慧的结晶。这是毛泽东思想哺育的结果。
    革命的小将吼声震天：要革命，要造反！雷声隆隆，电光闪闪，文化革命的暴风雨，来势迅猛，如泰山盖顶，如怒涛汹涌，顺之者存，逆之者亡。
    在小将们的革命进攻面前，那些走资本主义道路的当权派老爷们，感到大难临头，混不下去了，就颠倒黑白，混淆是非，耍阴谋，放暗箭，造谣言，强加种种罪名，对他们进行迫害。
   “你们是反革命”。走资本主义道路的当权派，自封为党的化身，“老子就是党”，谁反对他们，谁就是反党，就是反革命。
    革命的青少年们，天不怕，地不怕，鬼不怕，神不怕。死都不怕，难道还怕“反革命”的帽子吗？他们知道，他们的行动是革命的行动，伟大的领袖毛主席支持着他们，伟大的毛泽东思想鼓舞着他们。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命，使他们擦亮了眼睛，开通了思想，豁然大悟：必须革命，必须造反，必须造资产阶级的反，造帝国主义的反，造修正主义的反，造一切牛鬼蛇神的反，造一切剥削阶级意识形态的反。他们欢呼：让革命的烈火烧得更猛更旺吧！
      “你们捣乱”。讲对了。革命的青少年们就是要捣你们的乱。他们就是要用毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器，把旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，捣得乱乱的，把那些走资本主义道路的当权派的统治捣得乱乱的。如果不这样干，那还叫什么革命？无产阶级的文化大革命，就是要把资产阶级的旧章法、旧规矩、旧秩序统统打乱，就是要用革命的铁扫帚，把资本主义、修正主义的马厩一扫而光。
      “糟透了”。革命的闯将们用大字报、大辩论的形式，大鸣大放，大揭露，大批判，向反动的资产阶级代表人物猛烈开火。走资本主义道路的当权派遭到了无情的揭露，资产阶级的反动学术“权威”受到了尖锐的批判。他们威风扫地，体面丢光。于是，他们大喊：“糟透了”。奇怪得很，有些同志也跟着乱嚷一气。你若是一个确定了革命观点的人，迈开双脚，到群众中去看一看，你就会觉得一种从来未有的痛快。打倒阎王殿，革命的红小鬼解放了。他们抡起金箍棒，把资产阶级的反动堡垒打得落花流水，打得天翻地覆。这是千百万群众的盛大节日，这是空前未有的奇观。
    “你们狂妄，你们幼稚”。被人们讥为“乳臭未干”的年青人，藐视一切资产阶级“权威”，敢于向他们挑战，敢于把那些走资本主义道路的当权派拉下马。革命的青少年，要以毛泽东思想为武器，彻底批判旧世界，彻底改造旧世界，彻底破除几千年来层层堆积起来的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯；要把整个旧世界翻过来，按照毛泽东思想创立一个新世界。这是狂妄么？不，这是顶天立地的革命大志。
    从古以来，敢于闹革命，敢于创新的，大都是“幼稚”的年青人。他们一抓到真理，就藐视老古董，向老古董宣战，而有“学问”的老古董，总是压迫他们。但是胜利的总是那些原来名不见“经传”的青年。
    一百多年以前，两位年青人——马克思、恩格斯，写了划时代的辉煌巨著《共产党宣言》，他们宣布要向旧世界开战，“要同传统的观念实行最彻底的决裂”，让反动的统治阶级“在共产主义革命面前发抖”。
    我们最伟大的领袖毛主席，当他还是一位二十多岁的青年时，就主编《湘江评论》，发表许多彪炳显赫的革命雄文，提出打倒旧世界，让贵族、资本家在我们面前发抖的彻底革命的战斗口号。
    革命的辩证法是无情的。那些代表旧势力的人物，看起来似乎是庞然大物，不可一世。但是，他们逃脱不了革命辩证法的惩罚。那些代表新生力量的小人物，不管在斗争中将遭受怎样的艰难曲折，遇到多么大的阻力，他们最后必将战胜旧势力。
    伟大的毛泽东思想如春风化雨。在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的革命青少年们，是多么的可爱呵！
    他们最听毛主席的话，最最热爱我们的伟大领袖毛主席。
    他们有坚定明确的政治方向，他们的革命大方向始终是正确的。他们不为名，不为利，一心一意闹革命，一心一意为人民。
    他们“敢”字当头，敢想，敢说，敢干，敢闯，敢革命。为了捍卫毛泽东思想，为了无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，他们刀山敢上，火海敢下，海枯石烂，永不变心。他们是敢于“冲决罗网”的“狂飙”式人物，而不是小心翼翼，生怕革命烈火烧伤自己手指的政治庸人。他们是敢于在革命大风暴中搏击长空的雄鹰，而不是蜷缩在屋檐底下的家雀。
    他们爱憎分明，对人民一颗红心，无限热爱；对走资本主义道路的当权派，对资产阶级的反动学术“权威”，无比仇恨。
    他们充满着革命的朝气，敢于披荆斩棘，走前人没有走过的道路。
    他们的革命思想和革命力量的唯一源泉，是伟大的毛泽东思想。
    当然，他们的斗争经验还不多，难免有这样那样的缺点。但是，在革命斗争的大风浪中，他们一定会进一步用毛泽东思想武装起来，把自己锻炼成为德才兼备、智勇双全的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    他们是无产阶级革命的未来和希望。有了这样坚强的革命后代，我们伟大的祖国，就能千秋万代永远保持鲜红的颜色。
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，从来是像慈父般地关怀着革命的青少年。毛主席对革命青少年寄予无限的希望。毛主席说：
      “世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好像早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上。”
    革命的青少年们，一定会牢记毛主席的这个亲切教导和殷切希望，更加努力地活学活用毛主席著作，活学活用十六条，不但敢于斗争，而且善于斗争，团结一切可以团结的力量，打击一小撮最反动的右派，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    在毛泽东思想伟大红旗的指引下，革命的青少年一定会在无产阶级文化大革命的洪炉中，迅速成长。
    新生的力量是无敌的。未来属于革命的青少年。
    向革命的青少年致以崇高的敬意！
          （原载《红旗》杂志一九六六年第十一期）
