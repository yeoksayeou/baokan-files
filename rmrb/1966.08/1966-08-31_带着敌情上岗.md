	On Duty with a Sense of Enemy Presence
	April 24, 1966
	On Duty: Lin Qiaoliang, Zhang Yulin

	Our equipment is a weapon in our struggle against imperialism and revisionism. We must take good care of it, making it serve us obediently. After taking over, in coordination with technician Yi, we adjusted the stroke of pump 204 to be longer. This not only makes the flow stable but, more importantly, reduces local wear and tear on the pump cylinder, extending the pump's lifespan.

	The leakage and fire in the third reactor was a major test for our team. In this firefighting battle, the brilliance of Chairman Mao's thoughts was demonstrated. Tan Naishu went on duty with a sense of enemy presence, discovered the reactor on fire, and immediately used steam for cover. In the face of thirty atmospheres of pressure and a temperature of 495 degrees Celsius, with the urgency of leakage and fire, he remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, summoned revolutionary daring, and maintained a scientific attitude. We also formulated measures for stopping work and handling emergencies. All members of the fourth shift rushed from their dormitories. Under the cover of steam, everyone fearlessly fought, finally sealing the leaking spot. This fierce battle was won. Their fearless revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win is worth learning from.

	On Duty: Zhang Junfu, Li Liuxin

	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great victories, and we are very happy. However, the struggle has not ended; we will not stop until we achieve complete victory. Chairman Mao teaches us: "...the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the realm of ideology is long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very intense." Where there is class, there is class struggle. If we do not think and act this way, we will fall into the enemy's trap, and the power will not be consolidated.

	In production, it is the same. If production is stable, we also become complacent, leading to negligence and underestimating the enemy. Then, accidents will definitely occur. Today's incident of the third reactor's outlet flame should be taken seriously.

	On Duty: Liu Yunqi, Zhai Wen

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "All commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army must never relax their fighting spirit. Any thought of relaxing the fighting spirit and underestimating the enemy is wrong." Currently, our equipment has been safely operating for 184 days, but this is not our goal. Our goal is to achieve long-term safe operation for 200 days, 300 days, to develop our own refining technology, to bring glory to the country, to fight for the people, to produce more qualified products, to support the world revolution, and to give a heavy blow to the American imperialists and the ghosts and snakes like Deng Tuo.

	Today, all operators in our shift have this saying of Chairman Mao firmly in our minds, using it as a driving force for our work. Because when production is very stable, having "enemy presence" in our minds allows us to deal with any potential problems at any time.

	On Duty: Chen Deguo

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Having advantages without preparation is not a true advantage and does not have the initiative. Understanding this, a force with disadvantages but prepared can launch a surprise attack on the enemy and defeat the advantaged." I used to think that I was an old compressor worker, having operated a 1200-horsepower compressor, so I was complacent and underestimated the enemy. Through Chairman Mao's teachings, I realized that my past thoughts were wrong. Without preparation, if something happens, I would definitely be in a panic. Although I have been in the factory for a long time, it seems like an advantage, but without Chairman Mao's ideological guidance, going on duty without a sense of enemy presence is not an advantage. In other words, I am not even as good as a new hand. In recent times, I have overcome this dangerous thought and done a lot of accident pre-planning on duty.

    带着敌情上岗
    一九六六年四月二十四日
    值班人　林乔良　张雨林
    设备是我们反帝反修的武器，我们必须好好保养，使它驯服地为我们服务。接班后，配合技术员伊同志把泵—204行程调长，这样不但打量稳，更重要的是减轻了泵缸的局部磨损，延长了泵的寿命。
    一九六六年五月十一日
    车间评语
    第三反应器漏气着火，是对我们队伍一次重大考验。在这场灭火斗争中，体现出毛主席思想的光辉。谭乃树带着敌情上岗，发现反应器着火，立即用蒸汽掩护。在三十个气压，四百九十五度高温，漏气着火这样急迫时刻，牢记毛主席教导，鼓起革命闯劲，保持科学态度。我们并拟定了停工及紧急事故处理等措施。四班全体同志从宿舍赶来了，大家在蒸汽掩护下，奋不顾身，终于把漏气的地方给紧上了。这场恶战打胜了。他们这种敢于斗争、敢于胜利的大无畏革命精神，值得我们学习。
    一九六六年六月六日
    值班人　张君福　李留新
    文化大革命取得了伟大胜利，我们非常高兴。但是斗争并没有结束，不获全胜，决不收兵。毛主席教导我们：“……无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”有阶级就有阶级斗争。如果不这样想，这样做，就要上敌人的当，政权就不能巩固。
    生产上也是如此。假如生产平稳，我们也跟着稳下来了，产生了麻痹轻敌情绪，那么事故必定马上就会出现。如今天三号反应器出口法蓝着火一事，应引起我们的重视。
    一九六六年六月二十一日
    值班人　刘云奇　翟稳
    毛主席教导我们：“人民解放军的全体指挥员、战斗员，绝对不可以稍微松懈自己的战斗意志，任何松懈战斗意志的思想和轻敌的思想，都是错误的。”目前我们这套装置已安全开炼一百八十四天，但这不是我们的目的，我们的目的要长周期安全开炼二百天、三百天，闯出自己的炼油工艺，为国争光，为民争气，多出合格产品，支援世界革命，狠打美帝和邓拓这帮牛鬼蛇神。
    今天我们班全体操作员都把毛主席这段话牢牢记在心里，作为鞭策自己的工作动力。因为在生产很平稳的时候，我们心里有“敌情”二字，就可以随时对付可能出现的问题。
    一九六六年七月五日
    值班人　陈德国
    毛主席教导我们：“优势而无准备，不是真正的优势，也没有主动。懂得这一点，劣势而有准备之军，常可对敌举行不意的攻势，把优势者打败。”我过去总以为自己是老压缩机工，一千二百马力压缩机也干过，所以思想麻痹轻敌。经过毛主席的教导，使自己认识到过去想法相当错误。如没有准备，一旦出了事，一定手忙脚乱。虽然自己入厂时间较长，看起来好像优势，可是没有毛主席思想指导，上岗没带敌情，并不是优势。换句话讲，连个新手都不如。最近一个时期，把这个危险的思想克服掉了，在岗上做了很多事故预想。
