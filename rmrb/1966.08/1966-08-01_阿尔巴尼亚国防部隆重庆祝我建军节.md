Albanian Ministry of National Defense Celebrates the Anniversary of the Founding of the PLA

Vice Chief of Staff Kino says Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings have laid a scientific foundation for the development of people's war. Li Yifan praises the great achievements of the Albanian people's army under the leadership of the Party of Labor of Albania and Comrade Enver Hoxha.

NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, TIRANA, JULY 30 — The Albanian Ministry of National Defense held a grand meeting at the "Officers' House" in Tirana on the evening of the 29th to celebrate the 39th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

The stage was adorned with portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong and Comrade Enver Hoxha, as well as the national flags of the two countries. A banner on the stage read: "Long live the fighting unity of the peoples and armies of Albania and China!"

The celebration was presided over by Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Albanian People's Army, Boqi. Vice Chief of Staff of the Albanian People's Army, Kino, and Military Attaché of the Chinese Embassy in Albania, Li Yifan, both spoke at the meeting.

Kino said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army, since its founding, has followed the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong's teachings combine Marxism-Leninism with the specific conditions of the time, creating the basic principles for the theory and practice of all combat actions, and laying a scientific foundation for the development of a protracted people's war.

Kino emphasized that the great socialist cultural revolution currently underway in China is a great historical contribution to the struggle to eradicate bourgeois and feudal ideology and strengthen proletarian ideology, to achieve a thorough victory for the socialist revolution, and to ultimately defeat imperialism and revisionism.

Kino said that the fraternal Vietnamese people have shattered the myth of the invincibility of American imperialism, demonstrating to the world that the strategy of people's war triumphs over the strategy of "special warfare" of the American imperialists. The Vietnamese people are advancing with confidence on the road to victory, with the great support of the fraternal country, the People's Republic of China.

Kino also mentioned that a series of major revolutionary measures adopted by the Central Committee of the Party of Labor of Albania have increased the momentum of the Albanian people's struggle for victory and mobilized the Albanian People's Army to enhance its preparedness and combat effectiveness. He said that under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Party of Labor of Albania, the Albanian people are achieving great successes in socialist construction and in the struggle against imperialism and revisionism.

Li Yifan emphasized in his speech that Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of our people and the soul of our army. Comrade Mao Zedong's thoughts on the people's army and people's war are a brilliant and creative development of Marxism-Leninism in the field of military science. With Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese people are invincible in their revolutionary cause.

Li Yifan highly praised the Albanian People's Army for its great achievements in strengthening national defense, self-sufficiency in production, and military and political training under the leadership of the Party of Labor of Albania and Comrade Enver Hoxha, and for upholding its revolutionary traditions.

Both Kino and Li Yifan praised the tested and enduring fighting friendship between the peoples and armies of the two countries, based on Marxism-Leninism.

The acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Albania, Wang Jinchuan, was also invited to attend the celebration.

The celebration featured screenings of the Chinese films "Grip the Gun Firmly" and "Song of Military Farming."

    基诺说，中国人民解放军从它建军那天起，就遵循毛泽东同志的学说。毛泽东同志的学说把马克思列宁主义同当时的具体条件结合起来，为部队的一切战斗行动创造了理论和实践的基本原则，为持久的人民战争的发展奠定了科学的基础。
    基诺强调指出：中国人民正在进行的伟大的社会主义文化革命，对于根除资产阶级和封建主义的意识形态和加强无产阶级意识形态的斗争，对于争取社会主义革命的彻底胜利和最后消灭帝国主义和修正主义的斗争，是一个伟大的历史贡献。
    基诺说，兄弟的越南人民粉碎了美帝国主义不可战胜的神话，向全世界表明，人民战争的战略战胜了美帝国主义者的“特种战争”的战略。越南人民满怀信心地在胜利的道路上前进，它得到了伟大的兄弟国家——中华人民共和国的巨大支持。
    基诺还谈到，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央采取的一系列重大革命措施，增加了阿尔巴尼亚人民争取胜利的动力，动员了阿尔巴尼亚人民军增强战备和战斗力。他说，阿尔巴尼亚人民在以霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导下，正在社会主义建设的劳动中、在反对帝国主义和修正主义的斗争中取得巨大的成就。
    李一凡在讲话中强调指出，毛泽东思想是我国人民的命根子，是我们军队的灵魂。毛泽东同志关于人民军队的思想，关于人民战争的思想，是在军事科学上天才地、创造性地发展了的马克思列宁主义。中国人民掌握了毛泽东思想，革命事业就无往而不胜。
    李一凡盛赞阿尔巴尼亚人民军在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和霍查同志的英明领导下，采取一系列重大革命措施，发扬固有的革命传统，在加强国防、生产自给、军政训练等方面取得的巨大成就。
