Chairman Mao with the Red Guards on Tiananmen

On August 18, Chairman Mao stood on Tiananmen Gate, bathed in the morning sun, and received several hundred representatives of the Red Guards. As they marched down from Tiananmen Gate, they were jubilant and waved their arms, shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao for ten thousand years!" Those who had shaken hands with Chairman Mao were especially excited beyond description. Lu Xiaohai, a daring revolutionary from the affiliated middle school of Tsinghua University, said with deep emotion, "Chairman Mao, you are the eternal red sun in our hearts!" He said, "Some bourgeois 'authorities' fiercely opposed our article 'Long Live the Revolutionary Spirit of Rebellion,' but it was Chairman Mao who first stood up to support us and highly praised the revolutionary spirit of this article. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! With you and your books, we fear nothing. We dare to rebel against all revisionism and are invincible, victorious in every battle!"

Lu Xiaohai was the first to see Chairman Mao. When Chairman Mao was sitting in the rest room, he and two other classmates from the affiliated middle school of Tsinghua University, Song Bolin and Han Ping, walked up to Chairman Mao and loudly said, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!" Chairman Mao, with a kind and friendly smile, replied, "Good! Good!" and asked them, "Where are you from?" The revolutionary youngsters loudly answered, "We are Red Guards from Tsinghua Affiliated Middle School. We will forever rebel against the bourgeoisie and revisionism!" Chairman Mao happily said, "I firmly support you!" The revolutionary youngsters excitedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao for ten thousand years! Long live Chairman Mao!"

When Chairman Mao was with the Red Guards, their blood boiled, and the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" echoed through the sky. The songs "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" praising our great leader Chairman Mao were sung over and over again.

Among the first schools to attack the bourgeois educational system was Beijing No. 4 Middle School. Students Kong Dan and Li Kejin, when shaking hands with Chairman Mao, were so excited that they couldn't say a word. They felt full of strength and were determined to follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life, whether it be a mountain of knives or a sea of fire, they would go through it! Student Xu Zifeng from Beijing No. 4 Middle School stood close to Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin Biao for a photo. He said, "This is the greatest happiness and honor of my life! I will definitely not disappoint Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin Biao's expectations and will be a successor to the cause of the proletarian revolution who can withstand the storms of class struggle!"

Members of the famous fighting organization known for daring to charge and attack—the "Red Flag" Fighting Group of Beijing University Affiliated Middle School—Wang Zhanheng and Mao Feng, when talking about their feelings of shaking hands with Chairman Mao, told the reporter, "When we saw that Chairman Mao's body was so healthy and so kind, we felt sweeter than honey in our hearts and felt we were the happiest people. Usually, we have thousands of words to say to Chairman Mao, but when we see him, we don't know what to say, only tears of excitement. When we shook hands with Chairman Mao, it was like a warm current flowing through our bodies. Ten thousand words, a hundred thousand words, all boiled down to one sentence: In the future, we must read Chairman Mao's books well, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions! We must be vanguards in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!"

Student Zhou Chunxiao from the affiliated middle school of Tsinghua University saw that Chairman Mao was wearing a military uniform and also had a Red Guard armband, and his heart was filled with inexplicable joy! Comrade Kang Sheng said, "Chairman Mao has also joined the Red Guards!" Little Zhou jumped up and said, "Chairman Mao is the Red Commander, and we are Chairman Mao's Red Guards!"

After Chairman Mao received the representatives of the Red Guards, he stood in the center of Tiananmen Gate, facing the sun, and waved to the million-strong crowd shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" The tens of thousands of Red Guards standing on the reviewing stand jumped up and shouted, and revolutionary enthusiasm soared to unprecedented heights. The Red Guards were so eager to see Chairman Mao more clearly! They shouted in unison, "We—want—to—see—Chairman—Mao!" They waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," like a blazing fire. Just as Beijing Institute of Aeronautics Affiliated Middle School student Wang Yaping on the west reviewing stand said, "Can Chairman Mao hear our shouts?" Chairman Mao walked from the center of Tiananmen Gate to the west and waved to everyone. The reviewing stand immediately erupted with earth-shaking shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" Wang Yaping excitedly said, "Chairman Mao knows our intentions, Chairman Mao and we are truly heart to heart!"

　　毛主席同红卫兵在天安门上
    八月十八日，毛主席在朝阳映红的天安门上，接见了几百名红卫兵的代表。当他们从天安门上威武地走下来的时候，欢腾跳跃，振臂高呼“毛主席万万岁！”特别是和毛主席握过手的人，更是激动得无法形容。清华大学附属中学的敢于造反的革命小将骆小海，无限深情地说：“毛主席，您是我们心中永远不落的红太阳！”他说：“有些资产阶级‘权威’拚命反对我们写的《革命的造反精神万岁》的文章，可是，正是毛主席首先站出来支持我们，高度评价了这篇文章的革命精神。毛主席，毛主席！有了您，有了您的书，我们就什么也不怕，我们就敢造一切修正主义的反，我们就所向无敌，百战百胜！”
    骆小海最先见到毛主席。当毛主席坐在休息室的时候，他和清华大学附属中学的另外两个同学宋柏林、韩平走近毛主席，大声地说：“毛主席好！毛主席好！”毛主席带着和蔼可亲的笑容回答说：“好！好！”并且问他们：“你们是哪儿的？”革命小将们响亮地回答：“我们是清华附中的红卫兵，我们要永远造资产阶级和修正主义的反！”毛主席高兴地说：“我坚决支持你们！”革命小将们兴奋地高呼：“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”“毛主席万岁！”
    当毛主席和红卫兵们在一起的时候，红卫兵们热血沸腾，“毛主席万岁！”的欢呼声响彻云霄。《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》这两首歌颂我们伟大领袖毛主席的歌曲唱了又唱。
    首先向资产阶级教育制度开炮的学校之一——北京市第四中学学生孔丹、李克津等人，在和毛主席握手的时候，激动得一句话也说不出来。他们感到全身充满了力量，决心跟着毛主席干一辈子革命，是刀山，是火海，也要闯过去！第四中学学生徐子非和毛主席、林彪副主席紧紧地挨在一起照了像。他说：“这是我一生最大的幸福，最大的光荣！我一定不辜负毛主席、林副主席的期望，做一个经得起阶级斗争大风大浪考验的无产阶级革命事业接班人！”
    以敢于冲锋陷阵闻名的战斗组织——北京大学附中“红旗”战斗小组的成员王战胜、毛锋在谈起和毛主席握手的心情时，对记者说：“当我们看到毛主席的身体是那样健康，又是那样慈祥，我们心里真比吃了蜜糖还甜，觉得自己是最幸福的人。平时我们心里有千言万语要对毛主席说，可是一见面，就不知说啥好，只是激动得流热泪。我们和毛主席握手时，就像一股暖流通过全身，千句话、万句话，归结成一句话：今后一定要好好地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，按照毛主席的指示办事！一定要在无产阶级文化大革命中当闯将！”
    清华大学附属中学学生周春晓，看着毛主席穿着军装，也戴着红卫兵的袖章，心里有说不出的高兴劲！康生同志说：“毛主席也参加红卫兵了！”小周跳起来说：“毛主席是红司令，我们是毛主席的红卫兵！”
    毛主席接见红卫兵的代表们以后，迎着光芒万丈的太阳站在天安门城楼的正中央，向高呼“毛主席万岁”的百万群众挥手致意。站在观礼台上的几万红卫兵跳起来欢呼，革命热情空前高涨。红卫兵们是多么希望能更清楚地看到毛主席啊！他们齐声高呼：“我——们——要——见——毛——主——席！”“我——们——要——见——毛——主——席！”他们挥舞着红色的《毛主席语录》，像是一片烈火在熊熊燃烧。正当站在西边观礼台上的北京航空学院附中学生王亚平说：“毛主席能听见我们的喊声吗？”的时候，毛主席从天安门城楼中央向西边走了过来，向大家招手，观礼台上立即爆发出震天动地的“毛主席万岁”的欢呼声。王亚平激动地说：“毛主席知道我们的心意，毛主席和我们真是心连心！”
