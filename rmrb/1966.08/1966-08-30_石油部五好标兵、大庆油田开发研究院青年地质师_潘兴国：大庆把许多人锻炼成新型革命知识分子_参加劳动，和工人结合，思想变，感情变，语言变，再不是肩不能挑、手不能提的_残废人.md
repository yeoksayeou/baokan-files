		Pan Xingguo, a model worker of the Ministry of Petroleum and a young geologist at the Daqing Oil Field Development Research Institute, said: Daqing has forged many into new revolutionary intellectuals. By participating in labor and uniting with workers, one's thoughts, feelings, and language change. One is no longer a "cripple" who cannot carry or lift anything.

		When the Daqing Oil Field battle began in 1960, the leadership organized us to study Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," urging us: "Scholars must rebel against the old world." In the past, many bourgeois intellectuals engaged in scientific research needed an office and a laboratory. However, when we came to Daqing, we had nothing. After getting off the train, everyone quickly set up wooden houses. Although it was windy at night, everyone slept very soundly. We felt that we had a pair of hands capable of labor and were no longer "cripples" who could not carry or lift anything.

		That winter, the weather was very cold. We built our own earth stoves and firewalls. We came to the Daqing Oil Field to be tempered and to unite with the workers and peasants. Everyone thought, "In revolution, do not forget the Long March; in construction, do not forget the Yan'an years."

		The young technical cadres of our research institute have all opened up land and farmed here. We pulled the plow and sang many work songs. One of them goes like this: "Red scholar, oh! Farming the land, oh! Not afraid of hardship, oh! Listen to the Party, oh! Move forward, oh! Steps in unison, oh!..."

		When there were not enough tools for fertilizing, we used basins to carry it. Everyone also composed a song to counter bourgeois ideology: "Who says we stink, stink we do! Who says we are dirty, dirty we are! Our hearts are bright!"

		Our participation in agricultural labor is not just to solve immediate problems, but more importantly, to narrow the gap between mental and physical labor. In the past, many intellectuals did not understand how food, clothing, and daily necessities were produced, so how could they have the thoughts and feelings of the working people?

		There was a comrade who had just returned from studying abroad. He wore gloves when handling manure. Later, he often went to the farm to work, and his thoughts and feelings changed. The concepts of dirty and smelly changed, and he no longer wore gloves when handling manure. He even voluntarily cleaned the toilets and had common language with the workers.

		Now, the staff and family members of our research institute cultivate 1,887 mu of land, raise 265 pigs, and 348 sheep. Every year, we participate in planting, weeding, harvesting, and fertilizing.

		In scientific research, this year we have carried out the "three-in-one combination" with workers as the main force, and tens of thousands of workers have become the main force in design. In the old society, workers were exploited and oppressed and could not go to school. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the workers and peasants rose up in revolution, overthrew the old society, and created today's conditions. We were raised by the working people, and now we must return our knowledge and theories to them. We must consciously smash the throne of technical monopoly by bourgeois intellectuals and let the workers and peasants become the true masters of science and technology.

		The combination of workers, cadres, and technical personnel in design has effects that are not simply additive but multiplicative. Workers know the oil wells intimately; they know every blink of an eye. Practice has proven that they not only can do design work but can produce high-quality designs. Last year, our technical personnel developed a plan for a certain area, and the workers also developed a plan. Comparing the two, the workers' design was more practical, and the results were very good. We realized that workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the most intelligent. They have strong summarization abilities and often use simple and clear language to highly summarize technical laws. These summaries grasp the essence and are more accurate and easier to understand and remember than those in books. What is theory? This is theory proven by practice. The workers' summary of their practical experience in the three great revolutionary movements under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is theory.

		We now take on the administrative tasks that bourgeois intellectuals used to look down upon, such as cleaning, managing meals, issuing salaries, subscribing to newspapers, and attendance. We manage ourselves. Some people say that it is chaotic all day, not like doing scientific research. They say: "You need blue curtains and a quiet night." We do not listen to such talk. We manage our lives in an orderly manner and have produced many "red household managers."

		Over the years, we have insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, focusing on politics in everything we do. As a result, we have achieved many world-class scientific and technological breakthroughs. We have realized that whether we can achieve high-level results does not depend on living in a high building, but on whether we hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and have a high degree of revolutionization.

		Following Chairman Mao's instructions, in the future, we will continue to combine work and research, and work together with the workers. In doing anything, we must consider the distant goal of communism. For the realization of communism, we must redouble our efforts today.

   石油部五好标兵、大庆油田开发研究院青年地质师　潘兴国：
   大庆把许多人锻炼成新型革命知识分子
   参加劳动，和工人结合，思想变，感情变，语言变，再不是肩不能挑、手不能提的“残废人”
    一九六○年我们大庆油田会战一上手，领导上就组织我们大学毛主席的《实践论》和《矛盾论》，号召我们：“秀才要造旧世界的反”。过去，许多资产阶级知识分子搞科学研究，首先得有办公室、试验室。可是我们来到大庆，什么也没有。下了车，大家就七手八脚地搭起木板房。晚上，虽然四周咝咝地透风，大家却睡得非常香甜。我们感到自己有了一双能够劳动的手，不再是肩不能挑、手不能提的“残废人”了。
    这年冬天，天气很冷。我们自己搭起了地炉和火墙。我们到大庆油田，就是来锻炼的，来和工农结合的。大家想的是“搞革命不忘长征路，搞建设不忘南泥湾。”
    我们研究院青年技术干部都在这里开过荒，种过地。我们人拉犁，编过不少号子。其中一个是这样的：“红秀才，咳哟！种大地，咳哟！不怕苦，咳哟！听党话，咳哟！向前走，咳哟！步子齐，咳哟！……”上粪工具不够，我们就用脸盆端。大家也编了一支歌，专门和资产阶级思想意识唱对台戏：“谁说我们臭，臭就臭；谁说我们脏，脏就脏；我们心里亮堂堂！”
    我们参加农业劳动，不仅是为了解决当前的问题，更重要的是为了缩小脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别。过去，许多知识分子不了解吃、穿、用是怎么来的，怎么能有劳动人民的思想感情呢。
    有一个刚从外国留学回来的同志，抓粪戴着手套。后来，他经常去农场劳动，思想感情变了，脏和臭的概念也变了，抓粪再也不戴手套了，还主动到厕所掏粪，跟工人也有共同语言了。
    现在，我们研究院职工和家属，种地一千八百八十七亩，养猪二百六十五口，养羊三百四十八头。每年我们都参加种、铲、割、施肥等劳动。
    在科学研究上，今年我们大搞以工人为主的“三结合”，成千成万的工人成了设计的主力军。旧社会工人受剥削受压迫，上不了学。在党和毛主席的领导下，工农起来闹革命，推翻了旧社会，才有了今天。我们是劳动人民养大的，现在要把知识和理论还给他们，要自觉地砸碎资产阶级知识分子技术垄断的宝座，由工农当科学技术的真正主人。
    工人和领导干部、技术人员“三结合”搞设计，效果不是简单的加法能计算出来的，而要用乘法，多少倍的乘法。工人整天在井上，真是油井一眨眼睛他们都知道。事实证明，他们不仅可以搞设计，而且可以搞出高水平的设计。去年，我们技术干部为某区搞了一个开发方案，工人也搞了一个方案，两个方案一比较，还是工人设计的更切合实际，采用后效果很好。我们体会到用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级最聪明。他们概括能力很强，往往能用通俗易懂的语言，高度概括一些技术规律。这些概括，抓住了本质，比那些书本上的条条确切好懂，又容易记。什么叫理论？这就是被实践证明了的理论。工人用毛泽东思想对三大革命运动的实践经验的总结，就是理论。
    我们现在把打扫卫生、管理伙食、发工资、订报刊、考勤等过去资产阶级知识分子不屑一顾的事务性工作承担起来，自己管理自己。有人说，这整天乱哄哄的，不像搞科学研究的样子。他们说：得有“蓝蓝的窗帘，静静的夜晚。”我们没有听这一套。我们把生活料理得井井有条，涌现出不少“红色管家人”。
    几年来，我们坚持活学活用毛主席著作，在用字上狠下功夫，时时、事事、处处突出政治。结果搞出了不少世界上的科学技术尖端。我们体会到，能不能搞出高水平的东西，不在于住多高的楼，而在于是不是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，革命化程度高不高。
    根据毛主席的指示，今后，我们还要搞亦工亦研、同工同研。做任何事情，都要从共产主义的远大目标来考虑。为了共产主义的实现，今天就要加倍努力。
