The first set of platinum reforming petroleum chemical engineering equipment built entirely by our country using its own scientific research achievements and relying on its own technological strength has, by August 25, safely operated for 250 days. This has reached the advanced level of similar equipment internationally in terms of long-term safe operation after the first run. The products processed by this set of equipment have excellent quality, with a 100% qualified product rate, and the main technical and economic indicators have all reached or exceeded international advanced levels.

This new production technology achievement is a new fruit of our country's workers actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought. It is a new victory in implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction and the Party's policy of self-reliance, striving for progress, persevering in hard work, and building the country through thrift. This fact once again convincingly tells people that as long as there are people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, any difficulty can be overcome, and any miracle can be created.

The platinum reforming petroleum chemical engineering equipment is a new type of refinery equipment currently in the world, and only a few countries can manufacture and build it. Its main use is to extract important chemical raw materials—high-purity benzene compounds—from petroleum through a chemical reaction involving a "platinum" catalyst. The structure of this equipment is very precise, with many processes, complex flow, strict technical requirements, and a high degree of automation. Any slight fluctuation in any process will affect the product quality. Therefore, achieving smooth start-up and long-term operation is a very arduous task.

The team responsible for operating this set of equipment is a young group, with an average age of only 24. However, because they have armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, they insist on putting politics in command, actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, treating the refinery as a battlefield against imperialism and revisionism, fully displaying the revolutionary spirit of daring to think and dare to act, daring to tread paths where none have gone before, and daring to scale peaks where none have climbed before. At the same time, they conducted extensive investigations and research, studied technology diligently, and soon worked out a reasonable set of operating methods, achieving success in the first production run and ensuring safe operation after the start-up. The workers said: New recruits fighting hard battles, all thanks to the red ideology. The victory of the new equipment's safe start-up and long-term operation is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

The fact that this set of equipment can maintain long-term safe operation also shows that our country's self-researched and designed process flow is advanced, the quality of our self-manufactured equipment and self-constructed engineering is first-class, the performance of our self-manufactured catalysts is good, and the technical level of our workforce armed with Mao Zedong Thought is also very high.

After this new type of petroleum chemical engineering equipment was put into production, it has already provided a large number of important chemical raw materials for various sectors of our national economy, thoroughly shattering the technological blockade imposed by imperialism and revisionism.

    敢走前人没走过的道路　敢攀前人没攀过的高峰
    我国自建铂重整石油化工装置达国际先进水平
    投产后，已为国民经济各部门提供了大量的重要化工原料，彻底粉碎了帝国主义和修正主义的技术封锁
    新华社三十日讯　我国完全运用自己的科学研究成果和依靠自己的技术力量建设起来的第一套铂重整石油化工联合装置，到八月二十五日为止已经安全运转了二百五十天，达到了国际上同类装置在首次开炼后长周期安全运转的先进水平。用这套装置加工出的产品，质量很好，成品合格率始终保持百分之百，主要技术经济指标也都达到和超过了国外先进水平。
    这项新的生产技术成就，是我国职工活学活用毛泽东思想的新成果，是贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线和党的自力更生、奋发图强、艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国方针的新胜利。这一事实再一次向人们雄辩地说明，只要有了用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，任何困难都能战胜，任何人间奇迹都可以创造出来。
    铂重整石油化工装置，是目前世界上的一种新型炼油装置，只有少数国家能够制造和建设。它的主要用途，是通过一种含“铂”催化剂的化学作用，从石油中提炼重要化工原料——高纯度的苯类。这种装置的结构十分精密，工序多，流程复杂，技术要求严格，自动化水平高，任何一道工序如果有一点轻微波动，就会影响产品质量。因此，要做到顺利开工投产和长周期运转，是一项十分艰巨的任务。
    担负这套装置运转任务的是一支年轻的队伍，平均年龄只有二十四岁。但是，由于他们用毛泽东思想武装了头脑，坚持突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，把炼塔当作反帝反修的战场，充分发挥敢想敢干的革命精神，敢于走前人没有走过的道路，敢于攀登前人没有攀登过的高峰。同时又大搞调查研究，刻苦钻研技术，终于在很短期间就摸索出了一套合理的操作方法，做到了一次投产成功，也保证了开炼后的安全运转。职工们说：新兵打硬仗，全靠红思想。新装置安全投产和长期运转的胜利，这是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    这套装置能够保持长期安全运转，也表明我国自行研究和设计的工艺流程是先进的，自己制造的设备和自己施工建设的工程质量是头等的，自己制造的催化剂性能是良好的，用毛泽东思想武装起来的职工队伍的技术水平也是很高的。
    这套新型的石油化工装置投入生产以后，已经为我国国民经济各部门提供了大量的重要化工原料，彻底粉碎了帝国主义和修正主义的技术封锁。（附图片）
