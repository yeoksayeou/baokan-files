Guo Moruo, the head of the delegation, solemnly declared at a grand banquet to warmly send off Asian and African writers: Ever loyal to the great thought of Mao Zedong, ever loyal to the struggle of Asian and African peoples for unity and anti-imperialism. Senanayake, the secretary-general, said that opposing imperialism must also mean opposing modern revisionism.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 1st: Guo Moruo, chairman of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, head of the Chinese delegation to the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers, and chairman of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers, held a grand banquet in Shanghai tonight to warmly send off writers from various countries and regions in Asia and Africa as they return to their battle stations.

Chairman of the China-Africa Friendship Association, Liao Chengzhi, attended the banquet.

Guo Moruo said at the banquet, "We will never forget your praise for our great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, and your enthusiastic praise for our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the new high tide of industrial and agricultural construction. This is a great encouragement and spur to us. We will forever be loyal to the great thought of Mao Zedong, and forever loyal to the struggle of Asian and African peoples for unity and anti-imperialism!"

He said, "At this moment when the people of Asia and Africa are launching a revolutionary storm against imperialism, I wish that with our joint efforts, we will soon complete the great task of overthrowing imperialism and old and new colonialism."

De Silva Priyadarshana Yogarajah, Secretary-General of the Permanent Bureau of Asian and African Writers, said in his speech: "We have made a correct decision. The Third Conference of Asian and African Writers will be held in Beijing. Today, all Asian and African writers and peoples have placed their trust in Chairman Mao. Because Chairman Mao is a true revolutionary leader. He is not only the revolutionary leader of the 700 million people of China, but also the leader of the revolutionary struggle of the oppressed peoples of the world."

He said, "The Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers has achieved great success. The representatives of 53 countries and regions who attended the conference have resolutely declared that they will continue to resolutely carry out the struggle against imperialism. This is the purpose of the establishment of the Asian and African Writers' Organization. The Soviet Writers' Union did not send anyone to attend the conference. Their action not only exposed themselves in front of the peoples of Asia and Africa, but also gave the Asian and African writers an enlightenment: those who want to oppose imperialism and old and new colonialism must also oppose modern revisionism."

Tonight, the banquet hall was brightly lit and festively decorated. The hosts and guests frequently raised their glasses, toasting the battle friendship established in the anti-imperialist struggle between Asian and African writers and peoples, which will continue to be consolidated and developed.

At the beginning of the banquet, Guo Moruo made a speech, warmly sending off the Asian and African writers as they return to their countries, and expressing a warm welcome to Mr. Senanayake and his wife, who have just arrived in our country. He said, "This Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers has raised the banner of struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the United States, and has strongly supported and assisted the Vietnamese people who are determined to carry the struggle against American aggression to the end, and all the peoples of Asia and Africa who are striving to maintain national independence. The hard work of friends from various countries has made the conference a success. The communiqué and resolutions of the conference have already spread throughout the Asian and African regions and the world, producing a strong and far-reaching influence."

Guo Moruo said, "Proletarian internationalism is the highest guiding principle of our foreign policy. We have always supported the just struggles of all oppressed nations and peoples in the world against imperialism and its lackeys. We will fully support the just struggle of our Vietnamese brothers against American imperialist aggression."

Guo Moruo said in his outlook for the future, "I am deeply convinced that when we meet again next year, the ranks of anti-imperialist writers in Asia and Africa will definitely be more formidable, and friends will definitely bring news of new anti-imperialist victories and new revolutionary works. As the host, the Chinese Writers' Association will definitely do its best to assist the Executive Secretariat of the Permanent Bureau of Asian and African Writers to ensure the successful convening of the next Conference of Asian and African Writers, and contribute all our efforts."

Following this, Senanayake delivered a passionate speech. He said, "The series of resolutions made by the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers in support of the anti-imperialist struggle of the peoples of Asia and Africa have pointed out the goals and purposes of our struggle to the writers of Asia and Africa, and also expressed the wishes of the peoples of Asia and Africa. We convened the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers to support the struggle of the Vietnamese people against American imperialist aggression. Representatives from 53 countries and regions in Asia and Africa came to Beijing for the conference because they wanted to truly support the Vietnamese people in their struggle against American imperialist aggression. The leadership of the Soviet Union, by which I mean the leadership of the Soviet Writers' Union and the Soviet government, has betrayed the Soviet people and betrayed the revolution of the world. But we have confidence in the people, and we also have confidence in the Soviet people. I hope that such a day will not be far off, when the true representatives of the Soviet people will return to the Asian and African Writers' Movement and all the revolutionary movements of Asia and Africa."

He said, "We are paying close attention to and studying the great Cultural Revolution taking place in China today. If the Soviet Union had carried out such a Cultural Revolution in its early years, it could have avoided the tragedy that occurred in that country today."

Senanayake said, "We will see each other again at the Third Conference of Asian and African Writers, and at that time, we will definitely be stronger."

Vice-heads of the Chinese delegation, Xu Guangping, Ba Jin, and Liu Binyang, and some members of the delegation attended the banquet.

Attending the banquet were also Vice Mayor of Shanghai, Liang Guobin, Zhang Chengzong, Jin Zhonghua, and responsible persons from various relevant departments and cultural circles in Shanghai.

After the banquet, foreign friends watched the grand revolutionary ballet "The White-Haired Girl."

    郭沫若团长在热烈欢送亚非作家的盛大酒会上郑重宣布
    永远忠实于伟大的毛泽东思想
    永远忠实于亚非人民团结反帝斗争
    森纳那亚克秘书长说反对帝国主义必须同时反对现代修正主义
    新华社上海一日电　全国文联主席、出席亚非作家紧急会议的中国代表团团长、亚非作家紧急会议主席郭沫若，今晚在上海举行盛大酒会，热烈欢送来自亚非各个国家和地区的作家重回自己的战斗岗位。
    中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志出席了酒会。
    郭沫若在酒会上说，我们永远不会忘记你们对我国伟大领袖毛泽东主席的歌颂，对我国社会主义文化大革命、工农业建设新高潮的热情赞扬。这对我们是极大的鼓励和鞭策。我们将永远忠实于伟大的毛泽东思想，永远忠实于亚非人民团结反帝的斗争！
    他说，在这亚非人民正卷起反帝革命风暴的时刻，祝我们共同努力，早日完成打倒帝国主义和新老殖民主义的伟大任务。
    亚非作家常设局秘书长德希普里耶·森纳那亚克在讲话中说：我们作出了一个正确的决定，第三届亚非作家会议将在北京举行。今天所有亚非作家和亚非人民把他们的信任放在毛泽东主席这一边。因为毛泽东主席是真正的革命领袖。他不仅是中国七亿人民的革命领袖，而且是全世界被压迫人民的革命斗争的领袖。
    他说，亚非作家紧急会议取得了巨大的成功。参加会议的五十三个国家和地区的代表，坚决宣布，他们将继续坚决地进行反帝斗争，这正是亚非作家组织建立的目的。苏联作家协会没有派人参加会议，他们这个行动，不仅在亚非人民面前暴露了他们自己，而且给亚非作家一个启示：所有要反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的人们，就必须同时反对现代修正主义。
    今晚，酒会大厅张灯结彩，灯火辉煌。宾主频频举杯，祝亚非作家、亚非人民在反帝斗争中建立起来的战斗友谊不断巩固和发展。
    郭沫若在酒会开始时致词，热烈欢送亚非作家回国，并对刚刚来我国的森纳那亚克先生和夫人表示热烈的欢迎。他说，这次亚非作家紧急会议高举反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的战斗旗帜，有力地声援和支持了决心把抗美救国斗争进行到底的越南人民和一切争取与维护民族独立的亚非两大洲人民。各国朋友们的辛勤劳动，使大会获得成功。大会的公报和各项决议，已经在亚非地区和全世界传播开去，产生了强烈深远的影响。
    郭沫若说，无产阶级国际主义是我国对外政策的最高指导原则，我们一贯支持全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民反对帝国主义及其走狗的正义斗争。对兄弟的越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略的正义斗争，中国人民要全力支持。
    郭沫若在展望未来时说，我深信，在我们明年重逢的时候，亚非反帝作家的队伍一定会更加壮大，朋友们一定会带来新的反帝胜利的喜讯和新的革命的作品。我们中国作家协会作为东道主，一定要尽自己的努力，协助亚非作家常设局执行书记处为下届亚非作家大会的胜利召开，贡献出自己的一切力量。
    接着，森纳那亚克发表了热情洋溢的讲话。他说，亚非作家紧急会议所作出的一系列支持亚非人民反帝斗争的决议，向亚非作家指出了我们斗争的目标和要达到的目的，也是表现了亚非人民的愿望。我们召开亚非作家紧急会议是为了支持越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争。五十三个亚非国家和地区的代表到北京开会，因为他们要真正给予越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略以支持。苏联领导，我所指的是苏联作家协会领导和苏联政府领导，他们背叛了苏联人民，背叛了全世界的革命。但是我们对人民是有信心的，对苏联人民也是有信心的。我希望这样的日子不远了，那时，苏联人民的真正代表能回到亚非作家运动和所有亚非的革命运动中来。
    他说，我们非常密切地注视和研究中国今天进行的伟大的文化大革命。如果苏联早年也进行了这样一场文化大革命，就能避免出现现在在那个国家所发生的悲剧。
    森纳那亚克说，我们将在第三届亚非作家会议上再见，那时候，我们定将更加强大。
    中国代表团副团长许广平、巴金、刘白羽和部分团员出席了酒会。
    出席酒会的，还有上海市副市长梁国斌、张承宗、金仲华以及上海各有关方面负责人和文艺界人士。
    酒会后，外国朋友们观看了大型革命芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》。
