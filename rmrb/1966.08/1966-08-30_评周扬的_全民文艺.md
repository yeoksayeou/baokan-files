The capitalist-roader in power within the Party, Zhou Yang, has long usurped the leadership position in the literary and artistic circles, persistently advocating a counter-revolutionary, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought literary and artistic black line. This black line has persisted from the 1930s to the 1960s. Its initial flag was "National Defense Literature," and its final banner is "Mass Art."

In 1942, Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" pointed out the direction for proletarian literature and art, leading to a flourishing revolutionary literary and artistic movement. However, for the past 24 years, Zhou Yang and his gang have been secretly opposing Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line, stubbornly resisting it, and persistently advocating a bourgeois, revisionist literary and artistic black line. Especially in the late 1950s and early 1960s, our country suffered three consecutive years of natural disasters. The Khrushchev revisionist clique took advantage of the situation, causing certain difficulties for our socialist economic construction. The bourgeois rightists, opportunists within the Party, and various ghosts and monsters in dark corners saw our temporary difficulties as an opportunity to attack the Party and socialism. Zhou Yang, this old anti-Party hand, also emerged to engage in evil activities against the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought. He fully presented his reactionary "Mass Art" program, which opposes serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Only by thoroughly criticizing Zhou Yang's revisionist "Mass Art" direction can we firmly establish Chairman Mao's proletarian literary and artistic direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Refuting the "Outdated" Theory

Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" pointed out: "The question of for whom literature and art serve is a fundamental question, a question of principle." Literature and art for the landlord class are feudal literature and art; literature and art for the bourgeoisie are bourgeois literature and art. Proletarian revolutionary literature and art "serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, are created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and are used by the workers, peasants, and soldiers."

Chairman Mao's direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers is the most complete, most thorough, and most revolutionary proletarian literary and artistic line.

Zhou Yang's "Mass Art" banner was raised in 1959. In 1959, at a cadre meeting, he said: "What is socialist culture? It is the culture of the entire people." In 1961, at the Beijing Literary and Art Work Conference, he proposed the slogan "All the people of the nation are the service objects," explaining: "This is different from the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, it is broader."

By 1962, Zhou Yang, taking advantage of the 20th anniversary of the publication of "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," clearly explained his so-called "Mass" art in an article he directly instructed and revised. He shouted: In a socialist society, workers, peasants, intellectuals, various democratic parties and personages, and national bourgeoisie elements, all the people, should be the objects of our literary and artistic service and work. In July of the same year, at a literary and art forum in Anshan, he even more bluntly stated his views: "We must be familiar with all kinds of people and serve all kinds of people, as long as they are not counter-revolutionaries."

After the Eighth Central Committee's Tenth Plenary Session, when the entire nation was resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great call to never forget class struggle, Zhou Yang and his gang continued to stubbornly promote the reactionary program of "Mass Art" in March 1963, attempting to maintain their position for capitalist restoration. Zhou Yang brazenly continued to advocate: After national liberation, the service objects of revolutionary literature and art have expanded greatly, all the people within the people's democratic united front, all classes and all aspects of the people, are the service and work objects of literature and art.

Zhou Yang and his gang directed their attacks at Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," maliciously slandering the "Talks" as "outdated." They put forward two so-called "bases" to use "Mass" art to subvert the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers:

First, they said that the current situation is different from the situation at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, and they loudly advocated that the socialist revolution has "victoriously completed."

Second, because the situation is different and the socialist revolution has "victoriously completed," the service objects of literature and art have become even broader. All classes have "united in the people's democratic united front" and are "actively participating in and supporting the great cause of building socialism." They believe that class struggle has been extinguished, and socialist society has become a harmonious unity of all people, with no contradictions, no struggles, only a common goal of struggle. Thus, the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers is too narrow, and the service scope must be expanded to all the people within the people's democratic united front. They believe that all classes and all aspects of people, including patriotic national bourgeoisie elements, should be the service and work objects of our literature and art.

Zhou Yang's black words are shamelessly opposing Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," openly opposing Chairman Mao's theory on class and class struggle in socialist society, and opposing the historic decision of the Eighth Central Committee's Tenth Plenary Session.

Chairman Mao's profound exposition of the theory of class struggle in socialist society in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" has been completely verified in the process of history since liberation. This is a creative development of Marxism-Leninism's theory of socialist revolution. The sharp class struggles in recent years have even more fully shown that the overthrown exploiting classes, though defeated, are still alive and unyielding, especially in the ideological realm, where they still occupy a dominant position and are engaged in a life-and-death struggle with the proletariat. Zhou Yang and his gang, completely ignoring the facts, advocate the theory of the extinction of class struggle, fabricating a set of lies such as "the socialist revolution has victoriously completed" and "the bourgeoisie are actively participating in and supporting the great cause of building socialism." Even after the decision of the Eighth Central Committee's Tenth Plenary Session was published, they still attempted to distort and subvert Chairman Mao's theory on class and class struggle, reducing the sharp struggle of restoration and counter-restoration in the countryside to a struggle between collective economy and the spontaneous capitalist tendencies of small producers. Their purpose is to blur the class boundaries, erase the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, socialism and capitalism, to achieve their counter-revolutionary restoration ambitions.

Serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers is the unshakable direction of proletarian revolutionary literature and art. After the victory of the New Democratic Revolution, proletarian revolutionary literature and art must still advance in this direction. Without this direction, it cannot be proletarian revolutionary literature and art.

Zhou Yang's so-called "All the people of the nation are the service objects" is clearly a subversion of Chairman Mao's direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The workers, peasants, and soldiers, who make up more than 90% of the population, are already the broadest masses of the people. Yet, Zhou Yang still finds this not broad enough. How broad should it be? He wants to include the objects of the socialist revolution, the bourgeoisie, as our revolutionary literature and art "service objects." Zhou Yang's so-called "broad" theory, in essence, is to fight for the "people's" seats for a handful of bourgeoisie and landlords, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. It is to make our literature and art serve the reactionary classes.

How can socialist literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers serve the objects of the socialist revolution? Zhou Yang's "Mass Art" is a name, but serving the reactionary classes is the reality. The purpose of Zhou Yang's raising the banner of "Mass Art" is to use it to replace the most fundamental principle of socialist literature and art—serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers—and to subvert the proletarian nature of socialist literature and art.

One is the proletarian literary and artistic line, that is, Chairman Mao's direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The other is the black line of bourgeois literature and art, modern revisionism, and the so-called combination of 1930s literature, that is, Zhou Yang's reactionary literary and artistic direction of serving capitalist restoration under the banner of "Mass."

This is a focal point of the fierce struggle between the two classes and two lines on the literary and artistic front since liberation.

Refuting Art That Can "Resonate" with All Classes

Zhou Yang, in order to promote his "Mass" art, spared no effort to erase class contradictions and abolish class struggle. He maliciously slandered our class struggle as "class labelism." He shamelessly shouted: "We must oppose our class labelism.... Class labelism is to stick a class label on everything, saying this is bourgeois, that is proletarian, as if people are incarnations of class.... Eating is class nature, spitting is class nature, where is there so much class nature." Look, how much Zhou Yang hates class struggle and how maliciously he distorts it! However, class struggle, including class struggle in the literary and artistic realm, Zhou Yang cannot erase. This path is blocked, so he has to think of another trick, fabricating a "resonance" theory. He said that "art first combines the thoughts and feelings of its own class, then influences other classes, and unites other classes," and even "eliminates differences and unites with common thoughts and feelings." How to achieve this? Zhou Yang said that this requires the "resonance" aroused by art that is "not much related to class nature." In this way, Zhou Yang, like a magician, transformed class art into art with "human nature." Such fallacies as "artworks are acceptable to any class, and works produced by a class cannot only be enjoyed by that class, otherwise the work is a failure" have been openly circulated.

In a class society, has there ever been such a super-class "resonance" at any time and place? "Resonance" must be based on common thoughts and feelings. The thoughts and feelings of the proletariat are fundamentally opposed to those of the bourgeoisie. Proletarian works will never infect the bourgeoisie and cause resonance; conversely, bourgeois works will never infect the proletariat and produce resonance. As Chairman Mao said: "The bourgeoisie will always reject proletarian literary and art works, no matter how high their artistic achievements are." Imagine, how can a play like "White-Haired Girl," which strongly denounces the crimes of the landlord class, resonate with "everyone," including the landlord class? How can it make the landlord class feel comfortable and unite with Xi'er, Daqiu, and the broad poor and hired peasants? Xi'er, Daqiu, and the broad poor and hired peasants, who have suffered the blood-stained oppression and exploitation of the landlord class, how can they "eliminate differences" and shake hands with the landlord class, unite, and make a big fuss? Lu Xun said well: "The poor will never have the regret of losing money in the stock exchange, the coal oil tycoon will never know the bitterness suffered by the Beijing coal picker, the famine-stricken people in the disaster area will never plant orchids like the rich old gentlemen, and Jia Baoyu's servant Jia Dajie will never love Lin Daiyu." In fact, Zhou Yang's "resonance" theory is just a plagiarism. Look at the words of the reactionary writer Liang Shiqiu in his 1928 article "Literature and Revolution": "Once literary works are created, they do not belong to any class or any individual. They are treasures shared by humanity, everyone can appreciate them, everyone can criticize them, everyone can receive them...." Compared, isn't this like dirty water from the same mouth? It can be seen that the theoretical basis that Zhou Yang proudly found for "Mass Art" is not some new creation; he is just repeating the clichés that the bourgeoisie has been chanting all along. Zhou Yang's peddling of such junk in the socialist era is not just exposing his true face as a running dog of the bankrupt capitalist class?

Refuting Art That Is "Politically Neutral" and "Harmful but Beneficial"

In conjunction with advocating the super-class "resonance" theory, Zhou Yang, in order to pave the way for his "Mass Art," also fervently advocated that art can be "indirectly coordinated," "without political content," and "harmful but beneficial," strenuously opposing Chairman Mao's principle that art must serve politics, and maliciously attacking the leadership of politics.

Chairman Mao taught us: All literature and art belong to a certain political line, and art that is parallel or independent of politics does not actually exist. Proletarian literature and art are part of the proletarian revolutionary cause. Therefore, the position of the Party's literary and artistic work in the Party's overall revolutionary work is determined and established, serving the revolutionary tasks prescribed by the Party in a certain revolutionary period.

The practice of class struggle on the literary and artistic front proves that art without proletarian politics is absolutely not proletarian art; works that cannot deeply reflect proletarian politics cannot become excellent socialist works. The musical and dance epic "The East Is Red" was highly praised by domestic and foreign audiences because it profoundly summarized the glorious history of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, vividly embodying the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. The novel "The Song of Ouyang Hai" was loved by the broad revolutionary readers because it successfully created a model of our era who is politically outstanding and actively studies and applies Mao Zedong Thought. The repeated revisions and refinements of the revolutionary modern Beijing operas "The Red Lantern" and "The Battle at Shanggangling" are also crucial in how to more deeply embody the proletarian revolutionary spirit. Their success is the result of highlighting proletarian politics.

Zhou Yang regards the principle that art must serve politics as a monster, hating it to the core. In a series of speeches, he maliciously attacked proletarian politics. He shouted hysterically: "Politics in command, politics cannot be too much, too much, it weakens politics, politics is not the commander, it becomes a soldier. The commander cannot do too many things, if necessary, he can come out and give a speech. Politics is the soul, the soul must depend on the body. Business and art are the body, without the body, the soul has nothing to depend on, and we don't know where it is."

The purpose of Zhou Yang's making these ghostly words is simply to try every means to lure literary and artistic workers away from the track of serving proletarian politics. He has not once or twice hinted at the attack: "Some leaders only want politics, not art, replacing art with politics, vulgarizing politics," shouting that we must "break the situation where everything is added with political views."

In Zhou Yang's view, the situation where "everything is added with political views" must all be "broken." How to break it? He fiercely raised three sticks.

The first is the "direct coordination and indirect coordination" theory. Zhou Yang advocated: "The creation we need can reflect the present, or it can reflect history, it can immediately coordinate and reflect politics, or it can not immediately coordinate and reflect politics," "we oppose the simplification of art coordinating with politics"; the times have "changed," relying on "revolutionary emotions" is not enough, we must change the "mistake" of treating art as a "propaganda team."

The second is the theory of "can have political content, can also not have political content." Zhou Yang advocated: "Our works should reflect both the present reality and summarize the times; they can have political content, and they can also not have political content."

The third is the theory of "harmful but beneficial." Zhou Yang advocated: "What is meant by harmful is that it has no political harm, but it has some benefit in life. For example, the play 'Dream of the Red Chamber' and landscape paintings belong to this category."

Stripping away his conciliatory words, it all comes down to advocating that art can be separated from politics, can be without politics, and can refuse to serve politics.

But does such a revolutionary art that has no revolutionary emotions but can indirectly coordinate with politics really exist in the world? Does such an intermediate art that is harmful but beneficial to socialism really exist? This is a pure lie. In the thousands of years of literary history, there has never been such an intermediate state of art. Lu Xun once divided the literature of old China into three categories: "helping," "assisting," and "chattering." In fact, there are only two kinds: the former includes "helping" and "assisting," and the latter, although it has nothing to help or assist, still "lives in the mountains but thinks of the imperial court," and still cannot escape serving or being subordinate to reactionary politics.

All art belongs to the politics of a certain class. Today, it is either subordinate to proletarian politics or bourgeois politics. There is neither a third kind of art nor a true vacuum zone between the two politics. Zhou Yang's fabrication of the fallacies of art with "no political content" and "harmful but beneficial" is a political struggle, using bourgeois, feudal, and revisionist reactionary politics to squeeze out proletarian politics. Proletarian art must serve proletarian politics and cannot deviate from this correct track for a moment. Revolutionary literary and artistic workers must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, hold high the great banner of highlighting politics, be the Party's obedient tool, serve the revolutionary tasks prescribed by the Party in a certain period, serve to promote the revolution of people's thoughts, and make art truly become a powerful weapon to unite the people, educate the people, attack the enemy, and annihilate the enemy, helping the people to unite and fight against the enemy with one heart and one mind.

Refuting Art That Can Be "Accepted by All Kinds of People" and "Diversification"

Zhou Yang, while openly subverting the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, erasing the class nature of art, and canceling the proletarian political content of art to pave the way for his "Mass Art," also strenuously distorted the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, using it as a shield for his "Mass Art." He frantically advocated bourgeois liberalization, canceled the Party's leadership, and aimed to let all ghosts and monsters out of the bag. They loudly advocated the theory of unlimited themes or no restrictions on themes, saying that writers have complete freedom to choose the themes they want to write about; it is wrong to only allow writing about workers, peasants, and soldiers, only allow writing about the new society, only allow writing about new characters, etc.; the taboos about themes will only stifle literature and art, develop formalism and low-level tastes. Because of their orders, the literary and artistic black gang in Beijing in 1962 dared to be so arrogant in opposing Comrade Ke Qingshi's call for literary and artistic workers to write about the "Thirteen Years" (i.e., the realistic themes of socialist revolution and socialist construction). Look, their targets of attack are so clear! They advocate this theory of unlimited themes, opposing the description of major themes of revolutionary struggle, opposing the portrayal of workers, peasants, and soldiers, opposing the praise of socialism.

In 1959, when Zhou Yang first put forward his "Mass Art" theory, he openly shouted against "one flower blooming alone, one school singing alone"; he shouted, "You only cultivate one flower, only cultivate socialism, and restrict it very strictly, and the other things are not wanted, but your flower cannot develop." "Eliminating the old things, his socialist culture will not get nutrition; without competition, he cannot absorb things from old experts and old predecessors, and he will make himself wither." Zhou Yang worked so hard to slander "one flower blooming alone, one school singing alone," isn't he opposing the socialist flower, the proletarian school? In essence, he demands "a hundred flowers blooming" but is not to bloom socialist flowers, but to bloom bourgeois, feudal, and revisionist weeds. The so-called "competition" is actually to let the weeds "freely spread" and let all ghosts and monsters come out together. At the Third National Congress of Literature and Art in 1960, Zhou Yang integrated this policy of letting all ghosts and monsters out with the direction of "Mass Art" in theory. He said:

... Because people's needs, interests, and hobbies are different, the more varieties, the better. Only diversified art can satisfy the ever-growing, multi-faceted spiritual needs of the masses, and can give full play to the different personalities and talents of each writer and artist.... Each writer and artist can decide what themes to choose and what forms of expression to adopt based on their political responsibility, personal life experience, interests, and strengths.

Here, the theory of unlimited themes in literature and art has been crowned with a "crown" of "satisfying the needs, interests, and hobbies of the people," which can be directly translated as "Mass." The so-called "satisfying needs, interests, and hobbies" of the "people" is also produced on the basis of all classes in the people's democratic united front being the service objects. To make literary and artistic works acceptable to all kinds of people and serve all classes, it is natural that they must be "diversified." This diversification is the more the better for ghosts and monsters.

This is Zhou Yang's signal for a full-scale attack on Mao Zedong's literary and artistic line. From then on, a big demonic wind was stirred up with the theory of unlimited themes as the center. Under Zhou Yang's direct command, the special issue on "The Problem of Themes" in the third issue of "Literature and Art" in 1961 was a declaration of war for ghosts and monsters to fiercely attack the Party and socialism.

As soon as the special issue on "The Problem of Themes" under Zhou Yang's direct command came out, his two henchmen from the 1930s, Xia Yan and Tian Han, immediately responded. In "Literature and Art," they shouted in unison to advocate "liberalization" in themes. Xia Yan openly shouted that in the problem of themes, "the leadership has the freedom to call, and the writers also have the freedom to choose. Any one-sidedness has its drawbacks." Tian Han vigorously advocated that historical themes and realistic themes should be on an equal footing. "Learn from the past to understand the present, without the past, there is no present." Soon after, he threw out the big poisonous weed "Xie Yaohuan," and Meng Chao's "Li Hui Niang" also came out at the same time. Together with the "leading" Wu Han's "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," a big alliance of ghost officials was formed on the Beijing stage. It was under the "call" of the theory of unlimited themes that all kinds of ghosts and monsters got the opportunity to spread freely. Whether in literature, drama, or film creation, a batch of poisonous weeds and bad works appeared. All these were closely coordinated with the counter-revolutionary restoration activities of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and closely coordinated with the fierce attacks of right-opportunists on the Party and socialism.

In a society where classes and class struggles exist, there has never been a completely "free literature," and there certainly will not be a "diversified" need, interest, and hobby without class struggle content. Especially the problem of themes, in the history of literary and artistic thought struggles, has always embodied strong political tendencies. What themes writers and artists pay attention to, what issues they have a keen interest in, this is absolutely not just a matter of their personal personality and style, but ultimately depends on which class they represent and reflect the needs of which class. Zhou Yang's so-called theory of unlimited themes of "Mass Art," his advocacy of bourgeois liberalization, has the greatest deceptive effect on the literary and artistic circles, and the greatest harmful effect. We must pull out this black flag by the roots and let Chairman Mao's proletarian policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend truly shine in the socialist literary and artistic garden.

"Mass Art" — A Free Market of Bourgeois, Feudal, and Revisionist Art

Excluding the political content of the proletariat, opening the road to "be accepted by all kinds of people," and letting all ghosts and monsters out of the bag, this is still not enough to make Zhou Yang feel at ease. He is afraid that this bourgeois dictatorship is not strong enough. So, he turned to the corpse, that is, the so-called "preserving the ideological system of the old era in today's literature and art"; "to make the culture of Greece and Rome and two thousand years of China available to the Chinese people." This means that creating a real "Mass" art is not enough, Zhou Yang also wants to bring in the most decadent and reactionary "new wave," "modernism" of contemporary bourgeoisie, both at home and abroad, as part of his "Mass Art." He believes that "without this condition, it is impossible to have a cultural high tide." Zhou Yang has not once loudly called for: "We cannot kill the ancients with one stick," feudal operas "have an eternal beauty, an eternal charm," "not only conform to our specific times, but can last until communism, forever"; therefore, we must oppose the so-called "massacre and slaughter" of heritage; we must print all the more than 50,000 traditional opera scripts that have been collected. At the same time, he fervently advocated the European bourgeois culture of the 19th century, which is "the peak of world human culture." Shamelessly shouting, Stanislavsky is "a great Skyscraper," is "indestructible." Foreign bourgeois things, even if the masses cannot accept them, must be "moved a little today, a little tomorrow, so that the masses can gradually accept them," and quickly popularize "The Lady of the Camellias" and other works on the Chinese stage, making "East-West fusion," and saying that this "fusion" is a "natural trend," a "necessary trend."

All this is the free market of "Mass Art" that Zhou Yang has outlined.

For more than a decade, the literary and artistic circles have been under Zhou Yang's frenzied advocacy of worshipping the West and restoring the old, letting all kinds of bourgeois and feudal literary and artistic works dominate proletarian literature and art. In the free market of "Mass Art," he has been selling and spreading poison, poisoning the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, poisoning the younger generation, and poisoning the literary and artistic ranks. Zhou Yang, this executioner who kills with a soft knife, has completely become the reactionary guardian of landlord and bourgeois culture. His theory of fully inheriting all cultural heritage of the past and present, both at home and abroad, is a genuine modern revisionist product.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "A certain culture is the reflection of the politics and economics of a certain society in the realm of ideology." There is no such thing in the world as a super-class culture that can serve different politics and economics. Marxism-Leninism has never rejected the critical inheritance and reference of ancient and foreign cultures, but inheritance and reference must be based on the needs of the proletariat, neither replacing the creation of new culture nor blindly copying, and it is not allowed to "preserve the ideological system of the old era in today's literature and art." It should follow Chairman Mao's instructions: "We should treat cultural heritage like we treat food. It must go through our mouth and stomach, and be broken down into essence and dross. Then we discard the dross and absorb the essence, so that it can be beneficial to our body." Zhou Yang's theory of "heritage as the basis" or "complete preservation" is obviously an attempt to replace proletarian new culture with bourgeois and feudal old culture, to fight for the permanent seats of the bourgeoisie and feudal classes in the ideological struggle, and to continue to poison and corrupt the revolutionary masses. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, thoroughly destroy this free market of bourgeois, feudal, and revisionist art, thoroughly eliminate its evil influence, criticize all the old culture of the exploiting classes, and create new socialist culture. Zhou Yang's "Mass Art" is to gather the reactionary art of capitalism, feudalism, and revisionism, occupy the cultural position of socialism, squeeze out proletarian art, make art serve a handful of bourgeoisie and landlords, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and serve their counter-revolutionary restoration.

Zhou Yang's "Mass Art" theory is a theory of restoring the art of the exploiting classes, a revisionist literary and artistic program against Mao Zedong Thought. "Mass Art" concentrates the reactionary essence of the literary and artistic black line represented by Zhou Yang in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

Under the banner of "Mass Art," Zhou Yang released a large number of anti-Party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds. It is one wing of the counter-revolutionary restoration activities of the overthrown exploiting classes within the country. It closely coordinated with the fierce attacks of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, coordinated with Chiang Kai-shek's clamor to counterattack the mainland, and coordinated with the revisionist activities of right-opportunists. It is also a branch of the counter-revolutionary political backflow of Khrushchev revisionism. The "all-people's party" and "all-people's state" of the 22nd Congress of the CPSU are thoroughly revisionist programs that were thrown out in 1961. The Khrushchev clique raised these two banners to subvert the proletarian nature of the Soviet Party and the Soviet state, restore capitalism, and implement fascist dictatorship in the Soviet Union. Zhou Yang is the echo of Khrushchev revisionism. "Mass Art" is a variant of the "all-people's party" and "all-people's state." Just as the Khrushchev clique was chattering about the "all-people's party" and "all-people's state," it was also the most rampant period for Zhou Yang to peddle his "Mass Art." Khrushchev used the slogan of the "all-people's party" and "all-people's state" to cancel the most fundamental thing of proletarian revolution—the proletarian dictatorship and the vanguard of the proletariat; Zhou Yang used the slogan of "Mass Art" to cancel the most fundamental thing of proletarian art—the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Zhou Yang, this old rightist of the bourgeoisie, obviously dreams of following the Khrushchev clique, openly raising this big black flag, and first realizing capitalist restoration in literature and art, preparing public opinion for a comprehensive counter-revolutionary restoration.

In the 1930s, he was the inventor of the "National Defense Literature" under the banner of Chiang Kai-shek; in the 1940s and 1950s, he was a fake leftist, a true rightist; in the 1960s, he was the advocate of the "Mass Art" under the banner of Khrushchev. This is Zhou Yang's counter-revolutionary career of more than 30 years in the struggle of classes.

The bugle call of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is blowing louder and louder. Under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and the young vanguard have risen up to join the struggle, sweeping away all ghosts and monsters. In this unprecedented great revolutionary movement, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought shines brilliantly. The literary and artistic black line represented by Zhou Yang, this counter-revolutionary literary and artistic gang, has been completely exposed in broad daylight, and he can no longer pretend to be a leftist and pass as before. We must thoroughly settle the accounts of Zhou Yang and his gang's anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes, thoroughly eliminate the evil influence of Zhou Yang's reactionary literary and artistic thought, tear up his tattered banner of "Mass Art," and let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high on all fronts of revolutionary literature and art.

    评周扬的“全民文艺”
    黎帆
    混进党内的走资本主义道路的当权派周扬，长期窃踞文艺界的领导地位，坚持一条反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的文艺黑线。这条黑线，从三十年代一直贯串到六十年代。开头的标志是“国防文学”，送终的旗号是“全民文艺”。
    一九四二年，毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，给无产阶级的文学艺术指明了方向，革命的文艺运动得到蓬勃的发展。但是，二十四年来，周扬一伙一直阳奉阴违，顽固地抵制毛主席的文艺路线，坚持资产阶级、修正主义的文艺黑线。特别是在五十年代末六十年代初，我国遭受了连续三年的自然灾害，赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团趁火打劫，给我国社会主义经济建设带来了一定的困难。资产阶级右派分子和党内的右倾机会主义者，以及各个阴暗角落里的牛鬼蛇神，把我们暂时的困难看成了向党向社会主义进攻的“良机”。周扬这个反党老手，也冒出来猖狂地进行反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪恶活动，全面地端出了他的反工农兵文艺方向的“全民文艺”纲领。不破不立。只有大破周扬的修正主义“全民文艺”方向，才能大立毛主席的无产阶级的文艺为工农兵服务的方向。
    驳“过时”论
    毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》里指出：文艺“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。”为地主阶级的文艺是封建文艺，为资产阶级的文艺是资产阶级文艺。无产阶级的革命文艺，“是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”
    毛主席制定的这个为工农兵服务的文艺方向，是一条最完整、最彻底、最革命的无产阶级文艺路线。
    周扬的“全民文艺”的旗号，是在一九五九年抛出来的。一九五九年，他在一次干部座谈会上说：“什么叫社会主义文化呢？就是全民的文化。”一九六一年，在北京文艺工作座谈会上，他又提出了“全国人民都是服务对象”的口号，并解释道：“这一点和延安文艺座谈会时不同，比那时广泛了”。
    到了一九六二年，周扬借纪念《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十周年的机会，在由他直接授意并修改定稿的一篇文章里，清楚明白地注解了他的所谓全国人民都是服务对象和为最广大的人民群众服务的“全民”牌文艺。他叫嚷：在社会主义社会，工人、农民、知识分子、各民主党派和民主人士，民族资产阶级分子等全体人民，都应当是我们的文艺服务的对象和工作的对象。同年七月，他在鞍山文艺界的座谈会上，更直截了当地说出了他的主张：“要熟悉各种人，为各种人服务，只要他不是反革命。”
    在党的八届十中全会以后，正当全国人民坚决贯彻毛主席提出的千万不要忘记阶级斗争的伟大号召的时候，周扬一伙在一九六三年三月，仍旧拚命地在宣传“全民文艺”的反动纲领，力图维护住他们进行资本主义复辟的阵地。周扬胆大妄为地继续鼓吹：全国解放后，革命文艺所服务的对象已经扩大了许多，整个人民民主统一战线内各阶层各方面的群众都是文艺的服务对象和工作对象。
    周扬一伙把进攻的矛头直接对准毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，他们恶毒地诬蔑《讲话》已经
  “过时”了。他们为了用“全民”牌文艺篡改文艺为工农兵服务的方向，摆出了两条所谓“根据”：
    第一，说什么现在的情况和延安文艺座谈会时的
  “情况不同”了，他还大肆鼓吹社会主义革命也“已胜利地完成了”。
    第二，由于“情况不同”，由于社会主义革命“已经胜利完成”，文艺服务的对象也就更“广泛”了。一切阶级已经“结成人民民主统一战线”，都在“积极地参加和支持建设社会主义的伟大事业”。他认为阶级斗争已经熄灭了，社会主义社会已经成了万众一心的和谐的统一体，没有矛盾，没有斗争，只有一个共同的奋斗目标。这样，为工农兵服务的文艺方向就太狭窄了，服务范围必须扩大，扩大到人民民主统一战线内的全体人民。他认为各阶层，各方面的人，包括爱国的民族资产阶级分子等等，都应当是我们的文艺服务的对象和工作的对象。
    周扬的这些黑话，是肆无忌惮地和毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》唱对台戏，明目张胆地反对毛主席关于社会主义社会仍然存在着阶级、阶级斗争的学说，反对党的八届十中全会的具有历史意义的伟大决议。
    毛主席在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》一文中深刻阐述的社会主义社会阶级斗争的理论，已经在解放后十几年的历史进程中得到了完全的证实。这是对马克思列宁主义的社会主义革命学说天才的创造性的发展。最近几年来的尖锐的阶级斗争，更充分地表明，被打倒的剥削阶级，人还在，心不死，特别是在意识形态领域里，他们还占据着优势，和无产阶级进行着拚死的斗争。周扬一伙竟然完全不顾事实，鼓吹阶级斗争熄灭论，编造出一套社会主义革命“已胜利地完成了”，资产阶级都在“积极地参加和支持建设社会主义的伟大事业”之类的鬼话。甚至当八届十中全会的决议已经公布以后，他们还妄图歪曲和篡改毛主席的关于阶级、阶级斗争的学说，把在农村尖锐的复辟和反复辟的斗争，仅仅归结为集体经济同小生产者的自发的资本主义倾向的斗争。他们这样做的目的，就是为了模糊人们的阶级界限，勾销无产阶级对资产阶级、社会主义和资本主义的斗争，以便实现他们反革命复辟的野心。
    为工农兵服务，这是无产阶级革命文艺坚定不移的方向。在新民主主义革命取得胜利以后，无产阶级革命文艺仍然必须沿着这个方向前进。离开了这个方向，它就不成其为无产阶级革命文艺。
    周扬的所谓“全国人民都是服务对象”，分明是对毛主席的工农兵文艺方向的篡改。占人口百分之九十以上的工农兵劳动群众，本来就是最广大的人民群众。可是，周扬却还嫌不够“广泛”。要“广泛”到什么范围呢？他要把社会主义革命的对象资产阶级，也“广泛”进来，作为我们革命文艺“服务的对象”。周扬的这套“广泛”论，说穿了，就是要为一小撮资产阶级和地富反坏争夺“人民”的席位。就是要我们的文艺为反动阶级服务。
    为工农兵的社会主义文艺，怎么能为社会主义革命的对象服务呢？周扬的“全民文艺”是名，为反动阶级服务是实。周扬打出“全民文艺”旗号的目的，就是为了用它来代替社会主义文艺最根本的原则——为工农兵服务，篡改社会主义文艺的无产阶级性质。
    一条是无产阶级的文艺路线，即毛主席的为工农兵服务的文艺方向。
    一条是资产阶级文艺、现代修正主义文艺和所谓三十年代文艺相结合的黑线，即周扬的“全民”牌的为资产阶级复辟服务的反动文艺方向。
    这就是解放以来，我国文艺战线上两个阶级两条路线进行激烈斗争的一个焦点。
    驳能引起各个阶级“共鸣”的文艺
    周扬为了推销他的“全民”牌的文艺，不遗余力地抹煞阶级矛盾，取消阶级斗争。他恶毒地污蔑我们搞阶级斗争是什么“阶级标签主义”。他放肆地叫嚷：必须“反对我们的阶级标签主义。……标签主义是把什么都贴上一张阶级标签，说这是资产阶级的，那是无产阶级的，好像人就是阶级的化身，只有阶级性。……吃饭也是阶级性，吐痰也是阶级性，那里有那么多的阶级性。”看，周扬对阶级斗争是何等地切齿痛恨，又进行了多么恶毒的歪曲！但是，阶级斗争，包括文艺领域里的阶级斗争，周扬是抹煞不了的。此路不通，他只好另想花招，胡诌出一个“共鸣说”来。说什么“文艺首先把本阶级的思想感情结合起来，然后再影响其他阶级，把其他阶级也团结起来”，而且还“要把不同的去掉，以共同的思想感情团结起来。”怎么做到这一点呢？周扬说，这就要靠文艺所唤起的“与阶级性关系不大”的“共鸣”。就这样，周扬像变戏法一样，把阶级的文艺，一变而为具有“人类共性”的文艺。所谓“艺术作品是任何一个阶级都可以接受的，一个阶级产生的作品不能只供本阶级欣赏，否则这个作品是失败的”之类的谬论，都公然流传开来了。
    在有阶级的社会里，何时何地存在过这种超阶级的“共鸣”呢？“共鸣”必须以共同的思想感情为基础。无产阶级的思想感情与资产阶级的思想感情是根本对立的，无产阶级的作品决不会感染资产阶级，引起共鸣；反之，资产阶级的作品也决不会感染无产阶级，产生共鸣。正如毛主席所说：“资产阶级对于无产阶级的文学艺术作品，不管其艺术成就怎样高，总是排斥的。”试想，像《白毛女》这样强烈地控诉地主阶级罪恶的戏剧，又怎么能引起包括地主阶级在内的“所有人的共鸣”呢？怎么会使地主阶级感到舒服，从而和喜儿、大春以及广大贫雇农搞“团结”呢？身受地主阶级血淋淋的摧残压榨的喜儿、大春以及广大贫雇农，又怎么会在斗争中“去掉不同的东西”，与地主阶级握手言欢，大搞团结？鲁迅说得好：“穷人决无开交易所折本的懊恼，煤油大王那会知道北京检煤渣老婆子身受的酸辛，饥区的灾民，大约总不去种兰花，像阔人的老太爷一样，贾府上的焦大，也不爱林妹妹的。”其实，周扬的“共鸣”说，也不过是“文抄公”的杰作。请看资产阶级反动文人梁实秋一九二八年在《文学与革命》一文中的“名言”：“文学作品创造出来之后，既不属于某一阶级，亦不属于某一个人，这是人类共有的珍宝，人人得而欣赏之，人人得而批判之，人人得而领受之……”。两相对照，这难道不像是一个口腔里吐出来的污水吗？可见周扬自鸣得意地给“全民文艺”找到的理论根据，并不是什么新创造，他无非是重复了资产阶级一直在念念有词的滥调罢了。周扬在社会主义时代贩卖这种破烂货，不正是暴露了他的“丧家”的资本家的乏走狗的真面目吗？
    驳“没有政治内容”、“无害有益”的文艺
    与鼓吹超阶级的“共鸣”说相联系，周扬为了给他的“全民文艺”开路，还狂热地鼓吹可以写“间接配合”“没有政治内容”“无害有益”的文艺作品，竭力反对毛主席的文艺必须服从政治的原则，恶毒地攻击政治挂帅。
    毛主席教导我们：一切文学艺术都是属于一定的政治路线的，和政治并行或互相独立的艺术，实际上是不存在的。无产阶级的文学艺术是无产阶级整个革命事业的一部分。因此，党的文艺工作，在党的整个革命工作中的位置，是确定了的，摆好了的，是服从党在一定革命时期内所规定的革命任务的。
    文艺战线上的阶级斗争实践证明，离开无产阶级政治的艺术，就绝不是无产阶级的艺术；不能深刻表现无产阶级政治的作品，也就不可能成为社会主义的优秀作品。音乐舞蹈史诗《东方红》所以获得国内外观众的热烈赞扬，就在于它深刻地概括了我国人民在毛主席和中国共产党领导下进行革命斗争的光辉历程，形象地体现了毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。小说《欧阳海之歌》所以获得广大革命读者的喜爱，就在于它成功地塑造了一个我们时代的突出政治、活学活用毛泽东思想的光辉典型。革命现代京剧《红灯记》和《沙家浜》的不断加工修改，千锤百炼，精益求精，关键也在于如何更深刻地体现无产阶级的革命精神。它们的成功，就是突出无产阶级政治的结果。
    周扬把文艺必须服从政治的原则视为洪水猛兽，恨之入骨。他在一系列的讲话里，恶毒地攻击无产阶级的政治。他歇斯底里地叫嚷说：“政治挂帅，政治就不能太多，太多，就削弱了政治，政治不是帅，就变成兵了。帅不能搞得事情太多，必要时可以出来讲讲话。政治是灵魂，灵魂要依附在肉体上。业务、艺术就是肉体，没有肉体，灵魂就无所依附了，不知道它到底在那里。”
    周扬制造这些鬼话的目的，无非是千方百计地把文艺工作者诱离出文艺为无产阶级政治服务的轨道。他不只一次含沙射影地攻击：“有的领导人只要政治，不要艺术，以政治代替艺术，把政治庸俗化”，叫嚷一定“要打破所有东西都加上政治观点的情况”。
    在周扬看来，“所有东西都加上政治观点的情况”是都要“打破”的。怎么打破呢？他恶狠狠地举起了三根棍子。
    其一曰：“直接配合和间接配合”论。周扬鼓吹说：“我们所需要的创作，可以是反映当前的，也可以是反映历史的，可以马上配合和反映政治，也可以不马上配合和反映政治”，“我们反对把文艺配合政治简单化”；时代“变化”了，光靠“革命情绪”不行了，必须改变把文艺当成“宣传队”的“错误”。
    其二曰：“可以有政治内容，也可以没有政治内容”论。周扬鼓吹说：“我们的作品应当是既有反映当前现实的，又有概括时代的；可以有政治内容，也可以没有政治内容。”
    其三曰：“无害”即是“有益”论。周扬鼓吹说：“所谓无害，就是政治上没有害处，而在生活上还有点益处的。比如戏曲《游园惊梦》、山水画就属于这一类”。
    剥去他那些折衷主义的词句，归结到一点，就是鼓吹文艺可以脱离政治、可以没有政治，可以拒绝为政治服务。
    但是，世界上真有这种连革命情绪都没有，却能间接配合政治的革命文艺吗？真有这种无害反而有益于社会主义的中间文艺吗？这是地道的谎言。几千年的文学史上根本不存在这种中间状态的文艺。鲁迅曾经把旧中国文艺分成“帮忙”，“帮闲”，“扯淡”三类，其实无非是两种，前一种包括“帮忙”和“帮闲”，后面这一种虽然无忙可帮，无闲可帮，但“身在山林，而心存魏阙”，也还是要“扯淡”，也还是离不开服务或从属于反动的政治。
    一切文艺，都从属于一定阶级的政治。在今天，不是从属于无产阶级的政治，就是从属于资产阶级的政治。既不可能有第三种文艺，也不会有介乎两种政治之间的真空地带。周扬制造“没有政治内容”、“无害有益”的文艺等奇谈怪论，就是在做“政治”的争夺战，即用资产阶级、封建阶级、修正主义的反动政治，挤掉无产阶级政治。无产阶级文艺必须为无产阶级政治服务，一时一刻也不能离开这个正确轨道。革命的文艺工作者一定要遵循毛主席的教导，高举突出政治的伟大旗帜，作党的驯服工具，为党在一定时期内所规定的革命任务服务，为促进人的思想革命化服务，使文艺真正成为团结人民，教育人民，打击敌人，消灭敌人的有力武器，帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争。驳能“为各种人接受”的“多样化”文艺
    周扬一边公然篡改文艺的工农兵方向，抹杀文艺的阶级性，取消文艺的无产阶级政治内容，为他的“全民文艺”开路，一边竭力歪曲百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，为他的“全民文艺”作挡箭牌。他疯狂地鼓吹资产阶级自由化，取消党的领导，以达到大放牛鬼蛇神出笼的目的。他们大肆宣扬题材自由化或题材无限制论，说什么作家完全有自由选择他所愿意写的题材；只许写工农兵题材，只许写新社会，只许写新人物等等限制是不对的；关于题材问题的清规戒律，只会把文艺窒息，使公式主义和低级趣味发展起来。正因为有他们这样的号令，一九六二年北京的文艺黑帮分子和他们的一些追随者，才敢于那样放肆地反对柯庆施同志提出文艺工作者大写“十三年”（即社会主义革命和社会主义建设的现实题材）的号召。看，他们的攻击的目标是多么明确！他们鼓吹这种题材无限制论，就是反对描写革命斗争的重大题材，就是反对表现工农兵，反对歌颂社会主义。
    周扬在一九五九年第一次抛出他的“全民文艺”的理论时，公开叫嚷反对“一花独放，一家独鸣”；叫嚷“你只是搞一朵花，只搞社会主义，限制得很死，其他的都不要，反而你这个花发展不起来。”“排斥了旧的东西，他的社会主义文化就得不到营养；没有人跟他竞赛，他就不能从旧专家、老前辈那里吸收东西，就把自己弄得枯了”。周扬这样卖劲地诽谤“一花独放，一家独鸣”，不正是反对社会主义之花、无产阶级这家吗？说穿了，他所要求的“百花齐放”，根本不是放社会主义百花，而是放资产阶级、封建阶级、修正主义的毒草。所谓“竞赛”，其实就是让毒草“自由泛滥”，让牛鬼蛇神一齐出笼。在一九六○年的第三次文代会上，周扬把这个大放牛鬼蛇神的方针和“全民文艺”的方向从理论上融成一体。他说：
      ……由于人们的需要、兴趣和爱好不同，品种是越多越好。只有多样化的艺术才能满足群众不断增长的、多方面的精神需要，才能使各个作家、艺术家的不同的个性和才能得到充分的发挥。……每个作家、艺术家都可以根据自己的政治责任心，根据个人的生活经验、兴趣和特长来决定选择甚么题材和采取甚么表现形式。
    在这里，文学艺术的题材无限制论，已经被戴上了一顶“人们的需要、兴趣和爱好”的多样化的“王冠”，这“人们”可以直译为“全民”。所谓“满足需要、兴趣和爱好”的多样化，也正是产生在各阶级的全民都是服务对象的基础上。要文艺作品为各种人接受，为各阶级服务，那自然必须“多样化”。这个多样化，即牛鬼蛇神之多多益善也。
    这是周扬向毛泽东文艺路线全面进攻的信号。从此，以题材无限制论为中心卷起了一股大妖风。在周扬直接指挥下写出来的一九六一年第三期《文艺报》的《题材问题》专论，是号召牛鬼蛇神向党向社会主义猖狂进攻的宣言书。
    周扬直接指挥的《题材问题》专论刚刚出笼，他的三十年代的哼哈二将夏衍和田汉也立即出来响应。在《文艺报》上，他们异口同声地鼓吹创作“自由化”。夏衍公开叫嚷，在题材问题上，“领导有号召的自由，作家也有选择的自由。任何片面，都有流弊”。田汉则大力鼓吹历史题材和现实题材平起平坐。“观今宜鉴古，无古不成今”。不久以后，他就抛出了大毒草《谢瑶环》，孟超的《李慧娘》也同时出笼，再加上“带头”的吴晗的《海瑞罢官》，在北京的戏曲舞台上，形成了一个厉鬼清官的大同盟。正是在题材无限制论的“号召”下，形形色色的牛鬼蛇神得到了自由泛滥的机会，无论在文学、戏剧和电影创作中，都出现了成批的毒草和坏作品。所有这些，都紧密地配合了地富反坏右的反革命复辟活动，紧密地配合了右倾机会主义者对党对社会主义的猖狂进攻。
    在存在阶级和阶级斗争的社会里，从来没有那种完全“自由的文学”，也当然不会存在没有阶级斗争内容的“多样化”的需要、兴趣和爱好。特别是题材问题，在文艺思想斗争史上，历来就体现着强烈的政治倾向性。作家艺术家关注什么题材，对什么问题具有浓厚的兴趣，这绝不只是他个人的个性、风格问题，归根结底，它仍然取决于他们代表哪一阶级的利益，反映哪一阶级的需要。周扬所谓的题材无限制论的“全民文艺”，他所鼓吹的资产阶级自由化，对文艺界的欺骗作用最大，危害作用也最大。我们必须把这面黑旗连根拔掉，让毛主席的无产阶级百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，真正在社会主义文艺园地里大放光彩。
   “全民文艺”——资产阶级、封建阶级和修正主义文艺三位一体的自由市场
    排斥了无产阶级的政治内容，开辟了“为各种人接受”的道路，把牛鬼蛇神都放出笼来，这还不能使周扬放心，他生怕这种资产阶级专政不够巩固、不够有力。于是，他又乞灵于僵尸，即所谓“把旧时代的意识形态作为系统的东西保留在今天的文艺中”；“要使希腊罗马和两千年的中国文化，都能为中国人民所享受”。这就是说，仅仅创造一个现实的“全民”牌文艺还不够，周扬还要把中外文学遗产甚至当代资产阶级最腐朽、最反动的“新浪潮”、“现代主义”，都拉来作为他的“全民文艺”的组成部分。他认为，“没有这个条件，不可能有文化高潮”。周扬不止一次地大声疾呼：“不能一棍子打死古人”，封建戏曲“有一种永久的美丽，一种永远的魅力”，“不只已经合乎我们具体的时代，而且可以一直到共产主义，到永久”；因而，要反对所谓对遗产的“大杀大砍”；要把已搜集到的五万多个传统剧目的本子全部印出来。同时，他还狂热鼓吹欧洲资产阶级十九世纪的文化，是“世界人类文化的高峰”。无耻地叫嚷，史坦尼斯拉夫斯基，是“很大的斯基”，是“打不倒的。”外国资产阶级的东西，即使群众接受不了，也必须“今天搬一点，明天搬一点，使群众逐渐能接受”，要把《茶花女》等剧目统统搬上中国舞台，“很快地在中国普及”，使“中西合流”，而且说这种“合流”，是“自然的趋势”，“必然的趋势”。
    这一切就是周扬勾划出来的“全民文艺”的自由市场。
    十几年来，文艺界正是在周扬这种崇洋复古的狂热鼓吹下，让形形色色的资产阶级、封建阶级的文艺专了无产阶级文艺的政。他在“全民文艺”的自由市场里，大量地、狂热地贩毒放毒，毒害工农兵群众，毒害青年一代，毒害文艺队伍。周扬这个用软刀子杀人的刽子手，完全充当了地主、资产阶级文化的反动卫士。他这一套全面继承古今中外一切文化遗产的理论，是不折不扣的现代修正主义的货色。
    毛主席指出：“一定的文化是一定社会的政治和经济在观念形态上的反映。”世界上根本不存在可以超阶级的、为不同的政治和经济服务的上层建筑或文化形态。马克思列宁主义从来也不拒绝批判地继承和借鉴古代的和外国的文化，但是，继承和借鉴，都必须以无产阶级的需要为基础，既不能代替新文化的创造，也不能盲目照搬，更不允许“把旧时代的意识形态作为系统的东西保留在今天的文艺中”，而应当遵照毛主席的指示：对待文化遗产“如同我们对于食物一样，必须经过自己的口腔咀嚼和胃肠运动，送进唾液胃液肠液，把它分解为精华和糟粕两部分，然后排泄其糟粕，吸收其精华，才能对我们的身体有益”。周扬这一套以文化遗产为“基础”论或“完全保留”论，很明显，就是妄图用资产阶级、封建阶级的旧文化取代无产阶级的新文化，在意识形态领域的斗争中，为资产阶级、封建阶级争夺永恒的席位，让一切剥削阶级的文化继续毒害、腐蚀革命的人民群众。我们一定要遵循毛主席的教导，彻底摧毁这个资产阶级、封建阶级和修正主义文艺三位一体的自由市场，彻底肃清它所造成的恶劣影响，批判一切剥削阶级的旧文化，创造社会主义的新文化。周扬的“全民文艺”，就是要集合资本主义、封建主义、修正主义的反动文艺，占领社会主义的文化阵地，挤掉无产阶级的文艺，使文艺为资产阶级和地富反坏一小撮人服务，为这一小撮人的反革命复辟服务。
    周扬的“全民文艺”理论，是一套复辟剥削阶级文艺的理论，是一个反毛泽东思想的修正主义的文艺纲领。“全民文艺”，集中地体现了以周扬为代表的这条文艺黑线在五十年代末六十年代初的反革命的本质。
    周扬在“全民文艺”旗号下，放出了大量反党反社会主义的毒草。它是国内被打倒了的剥削阶级进行反革命复辟活动的一翼。它密切配合了地富反坏的猖狂进攻，配合了蒋介石反攻大陆的叫嚣，配合了右倾机会主义者的翻案活动。它又是赫鲁晓夫修正主义反革命政治逆流的一个支脉。苏共二十二大的“全民党”、“全民国家”的彻头彻尾的修正主义纲领，是在一九六一年抛出来的。赫鲁晓夫集团打出这两个旗号，就是为了篡改苏联党和苏联国家的无产阶级性质，复辟资本主义，在苏联实行修正主义的法西斯专政。周扬就是赫鲁晓夫修正主义的应声虫。“全民文艺”就是“全民党”“全民国家”的变种。正当赫鲁晓夫集团喋喋不休地鼓吹“全民党”“全民国家”的时候，也是周扬贩卖他的“全民文艺”的最猖狂的时期。赫鲁晓夫用“全民党”“全民国家”的口号取消了无产阶级革命最根本的东西——无产阶级专政和无产阶级先锋队；周扬则用“全民文艺”的口号取消无产阶级文艺最根本的东西——为工农兵服务的文艺方向。周扬这个资产阶级老右派，显然是梦想追随赫鲁晓夫集团，公开打出这面大黑旗，在文艺上首先实现资本主义复辟，为全面的反革命复辟作舆论准备。
    在三十年代，是一个蒋介石牌的“国防文学”的发明者；在四十年代和五十年代，是一个假左派，真右派；在六十年代，是一个赫鲁晓夫牌的“全民文艺”的鼓吹者。这就是周扬三十多年来在阶级斗争中一脉相承的反革命生涯。
    无产阶级文化大革命的号角越吹越响了。在毛主席和党中央亲自领导下，广大工农兵群众和青少年闯将们已经奋起参加斗争，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。在这个史无前例的伟大革命运动中，战无不胜的毛泽东思想大放光芒。以周扬为代表的这条文艺黑线，这个反革命文艺黑帮，已经完全暴露在光天化日之下，他再也不能像过去那样，冒充左派，蒙混过关了。我们一定要彻底清算周扬一伙的反党反社会主义的罪行，彻底肃清周扬反动文艺思想的恶劣影响，撕毁他的“全民文艺”的破烂旗子，让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，永远飘扬在革命文艺的一切阵地上。
