In this great revolutionary movement, the vanguard of our ranks is the brave and strong Red Guards. With the heroic spirit of sweeping away all monsters and demons, they are purging the reactionary influences spread by representatives of the bourgeoisie. Now, the revolutionary spirit and actions of the Red Guards have far exceeded the scope of schools, and are aimed at all the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes, and at all harmful elements.

Under the revolutionary might of the Red Guards, some shops in Beijing that exuded the strong smell of feudal thoughts and bourgeois copper coins have had their signs removed, and streets, parks, and place names that were named after feudal thoughts have been changed. The revolutionary actions of the Red Guards are like a sudden storm, swift and powerful! Their revolutionary deeds have been warmly praised and supported by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Our young warriors have not disappointed the ardent expectations of the Party and Chairman Mao. I cheer for the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards; the revolutionary spirit of the Red Guards is excellent!

Chairman Mao said: "All erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, all monsters and demons should be criticized, and they must not be allowed to spread freely." The young warriors are acting in accordance with this highest directive from Chairman Mao. Their big-character posters are full of revolutionary passion, embodying their high sense of responsibility for the proletarian revolutionary cause. Their criticisms are well-reasoned, with detailed analyses, and have strong persuasive power, fully in line with Mao Zedong Thought. To smash an old world and build a new world is the true goal of our proletarian revolution. For the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits left behind by the exploiting classes over thousands of years, and all the superstructures that do not conform to the socialist economic base, and all harmful elements and obstacles, we must not be lenient, we must not show mercy, we must smash them all, destroy them all, and remove them all!

The great Mao Zedong era is an era of heroes. In the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, "a large number of previously unknown revolutionary youths have become brave pioneers. They have courage, they have wisdom. They use big-character posters and great debates to speak out, expose, and criticize, resolutely attacking those open and hidden representatives of the bourgeoisie." I am extremely happy that our proletarian revolutionary ranks have produced tens of thousands of daring, bold, revolutionary, and rebellious young proletarian revolutionaries armed with Mao Zedong Thought! I want to learn from them their noble qualities of boundless love, loyalty, faith, and admiration for Chairman Mao, their spirit of firmly adhering to the correct political direction, their fearless heroic spirit and revolutionary fighting spirit; I want to learn from them their revolutionary spirit of daring to accept new things.

We should learn from the revolutionary young warriors not only to dare to struggle against all the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes, but also to dare to struggle against our own non-proletarian thoughts, and against the errors and shortcomings in our own thoughts and actions. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to observe everything and discern everything. Whether it is others or ourselves, we must resolutely support and follow all speech and actions that conform to Mao Zedong Thought; we must resolutely oppose and struggle against all speech and actions that go against Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Because we serve the people, we should not be afraid of criticism if we have shortcomings. No matter who points them out to us, it is fine. As long as you are correct, we will correct it. If your method is good for the people, we will do it your way." Every revolutionary should use this standard to treat the revolutionary young warriors' exposure and criticism of others and themselves, and should have the spirit of daring to admit mistakes and courageously correcting mistakes. Every revolutionary should be inspired, educated, and deeply benefited by the revolutionary actions of the young warriors.

    赞红卫兵的革命造反精神
    铁道兵某部　王蜀槐
    在这场伟大革命运动中，冲锋在我们队伍最前列的是勇敢坚强的红卫兵。他们以横扫一切牛鬼蛇神的革命英雄气概，涤荡着资产阶级代表人物所散布的一切反动影响。现在，红卫兵的革命精神和革命行动已经大大超越了学校这个范围，朝着一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，朝着一切害人虫开炮了。
    在红卫兵的革命威力下，北京一些商店散发着浓烈的封建思想和资产阶级铜臭味的招牌铲除了，以封建思想命名的街道、公园、地名更改了。红卫兵的革命行动势如暴风骤雨，迅猛异常！他们的革命举动受到了广大工农兵的热烈称赞，热烈支持。我们的小将，没有辜负党和毛主席对他们的殷切期望。我为红卫兵的革命行动欢呼，红卫兵的革命精神好得很！
    毛主席说：“凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。”小将们正是遵循着毛主席这一最高指示行动的。他们的大字报充满了革命的激情，体现了他们高度的无产阶级革命事业心。他们的批判，说理充分，有细致的分析，有很强的说服力，完全符合毛泽东思想。打碎一个旧世界，建立一个新世界，是我们无产阶级革命的真正目标。对于几千年来剥削阶级遗留下来的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯和一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑，一切害人虫、绊脚石，我们就是不能客气，就是不能留情，就是要统统地把它们打破、砸碎、搬掉！
    伟大的毛泽东时代是英雄辈出的时代。在当前无产阶级文化大革命中，“一大批本来不出名的革命青少年成了勇敢的闯将。他们有魄力、有智慧。他们用大字报、大辩论的形式，大鸣大放，大揭露，大批判，坚决地向那些公开的、隐蔽的资产阶级代表人物举行了进攻。”我为我们无产阶级革命队伍出现了用毛泽东思想武装起来的成千上万的敢闯、敢干、敢革命、敢造反的无产阶级革命小将感到万分高兴！我要学习他们对毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚、无限信仰、无限崇拜的高贵品质，学习他们勇于坚持坚定正确的政治方向的精神，学习他们大无畏的英雄气概和勇于革命的战斗精神；学习他们勇于接受新鲜事物的革命进取精神。
    我们向革命小将学习，就不但要勇于和一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯作斗争，更要敢于和自己的非无产阶级思想作斗争，和自己思想行动上的错误、缺点作斗争，我们要用毛泽东思想观察一切、识别一切。不管是别人或是自己，凡是符合毛泽东思想的言论和行动，我们就要坚决拥护，坚决照办；凡是违反毛泽东思想的言论和行动，我们就要坚决反对，坚决斗争。毛主席教导我们：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。你说的办法对人民有好处，我们就照你的办。”我们每一个愿意革命的人，都应该用这个尺度来对待革命小将对别人的和对自己的大揭露、大批判，并且要有敢于承认错误和勇于改正错误的精神。我们每一个革命者都应该从革命小将们的革命行动中受到启发，受到教育，得到深刻的教益。
