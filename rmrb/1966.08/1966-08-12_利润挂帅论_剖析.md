	An Analysis of the "Profit-Oriented" Theory
	Dongfang Wei

	Sun Yefang, former director of the Institute of Economics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is a black flag in the economic field who opposes the Party and socialism. For many years, he has viciously attacked the socialist system and the Party's economic policies, stubbornly promoting his entire set of revisionist economic programs, and fervently advocating for profit-oriented management.

	The question of how socialist enterprises should handle profits is first and foremost a political issue, one that relates to the fundamental question of for whom the enterprise serves and in what direction it develops. For example: Does the enterprise complete the various indicators of the state plan for the needs of the revolution and construction, or does it complete the various indicators of the state plan for the sake of increasing bonus income? Does it focus on producing varieties that meet the needs of the state, or does it focus on producing varieties that yield high profits? Does it wholeheartedly serve the needs of the state and the people, or does it quibble over the profits and losses of its own enterprise? And so on. All these questions reflect the struggle between two classes, two lines, two management ideologies, and styles. Practice has proven that to run a socialist enterprise well, one must take class struggle and the struggle between the two lines as the key link and implement political leadership. If an enterprise separates itself from political leadership and merely pursues profits, then this enterprise will inevitably degenerate from a socialist enterprise into a capitalist enterprise.

	Sun Yefang repeatedly says that we do not want profits, which is simply talking nonsense. Is Sun Yefang's argument with us about whether or not we want socialist profits? No! Absolutely not. He maliciously says that we do not want socialist profits at all, intentionally muddying the waters to peddle his private goods. The profit issue involves a series of fundamental issues regarding how the proletarian dictatorship state manages the national economy and runs socialist enterprises. We must analyze Sun Yefang's "profit-oriented" theory, fully expose its reactionary nature, and thoroughly refute and overthrow it.

	How can the amount of money earned be used to evaluate the quality of an enterprise's work?

	The standard for evaluating the quality of an enterprise's work is whether it emphasizes politics and strictly adheres to running the enterprise according to Mao Zedong Thought. Socialist enterprises must insist on political leadership, achieve the thought revolution of the people, adhere to the socialist direction, walk the socialist path, and serve socialist construction and the broad masses of laboring people. The primary task of our factories is to cultivate and train proletarian revolutionaries using Mao Zedong Thought. We must turn the factory into a grand school of Mao Zedong Thought. The quality of an enterprise's work is first and foremost about people, about the thought revolution of the people.

	However, Sun Yefang believes that an enterprise is merely a tool for producing goods and making money, and that the quality of an enterprise's work should be evaluated by how much money it makes. He says: "The amount of profit is the most sensitive indicator of an enterprise's technological progress and management efficiency." In his view, enterprises that make more money are advanced enterprises, those that make less money are backward enterprises, and those that do not make money should be eliminated.

	On the issue of the standard for evaluating the quality of an enterprise's work, we say that the factor of people comes first, that it is about the thought revolution of the people; he says that money comes first, that it is about how much money the enterprise makes. He is completely using the capitalist approach to oppose running enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought.

	Is profit the main indicator of the socialist economic plan?

	The socialist economy is a planned economy. The state manages enterprises through unified planning, making the entire national economy develop in a planned, proportional, and high-speed manner. Socialist enterprises must implement political leadership, carry out the general line for socialist construction, and fully complete the various indicators of the state plan. They must strive for excellence, seek more within excellence, seek speed within excellence, seek efficiency within excellence, and prioritize quality and variety.

	However, in Sun Yefang's view, the main indicator of the socialist economic plan is profit, is making money. He says: The profit indicator is the "central indicator" of the socialist economic plan. This means that the letter "profit" comes first, and making money is the top priority. The state and enterprises only need to grasp this "nose ring" of profit, and everything else will follow. As for what varieties, quality, and quantity of products, he does not even consider them.

	We say that socialist enterprises must be led by the unified state plan; he says that they must be controlled by profit. We say that enterprise economic activities must strive for excellence, with quality and variety first; he says that enterprises must prioritize profit, and making money is everything. According to his approach, the state would only be interested in money, and what socialist plan management would there be! The enterprise would only be a tool for making money, and what socialist character would there be!

	Is the rate of return on capital the basis for state investment?

	The socialist economy is based on the public ownership of the means of production, and the purpose of production is "to develop the economy and ensure supply." Therefore, the state's allocation of funds, that is, the distribution of means of production and labor force among different production departments, must be based on the socialist production purpose, according to political and economic tasks, and serve the needs of revolution and construction, implementing planned allocation.

	However, Sun Yefang advocates that the direction of state investment should be determined by how much money is made. He says: The state "should adopt which investment plan and allocate how much funds, it must make an economic comparison, that is, it must consider the average rate of return on capital." He wants the state to invest where there is more money to be made, to invest more in departments that make more money, and to invest less in departments that make less money, and not to invest in departments that lose money even if the state urgently needs them.

	It is not difficult to see that he opposes the state allocating funds according to the needs of revolution and construction, advocating that investment directions be decided by how much money is made; he opposes the planned adjustment of the national economy, using the rate of return on capital and production prices as the automatic regulator of state investment. This is not the abolition of the concentrated leadership of the proletarian state over the national economy, the destruction of the planned economic system, and the reduction of the socialist planned economy to capitalist free-market economy, what is it?

	Can profit motivate the enthusiasm of enterprises and workers for production?

	Socialist enterprises are not only the battlefield for the proletariat's production struggle and scientific experimentation but also the battlefield for class struggle. Enterprises completing production tasks must take class struggle and the struggle between the two lines as the key link, seize the revolution, promote production, seize the revolution, and promote construction. Political work is the lifeline of all economic work. Running a socialist enterprise must emphasize proletarian politics and emphasize Mao Zedong Thought. Through the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, Mao Zedong Thought is infused into the masses of workers, thus greatly raising the proletarian consciousness of the masses of workers, fully mobilizing their revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity, and transforming spiritual power into tremendous material power. This is the only reliable and sustained driving force to ensure that the enterprise develops in the socialist direction.

	Since Sun Yefang regards the enterprise as a tool for making money, he naturally emphasizes material incentives and uses profit as the bait to stimulate the "enthusiasm" of enterprises and workers. No wonder he says: "Profit is a necessary means of developing production," "determine the amount of profit to be handed over to the state based on the amount of capital used," to increase the enterprise's concern for profit; use "the part of the profit that exceeds the social average level to be distributed to the enterprise as a bonus in a certain proportion," to stimulate the enthusiasm of enterprise workers. This is how he uses profit as the whip to drive enterprises and workers to "advance again and again."

	We run enterprises for revolution and construction, relying on political leadership; while Sun Yefang runs enterprises for making money, relying on profit incentives. His approach will inevitably make our economy deviate from the socialist track.

	Do not allow Sun Yefang to distort the Party's general line for socialist construction

	The Party's general line for socialist construction is Chairman Mao Zedong's great development of Marxism-Leninism. It is the creative application of the objective laws of class struggle and economic development in socialist society. Its purpose is to fully mobilize the subjective initiative of the broad masses of laboring people. Its essence is the high attention to the consciousness, enthusiasm, and creativity of the people in the cause of building socialism. It is the only correct line to build socialism according to Mao Zedong Thought.

	Just as Deng Tuo slandered that "the east wind prevails over the west wind" is a "great slogan," Sun Yefang attacks the Party's general line for socialist construction as "empty." Then in Sun Yefang's view, what is the "substance" of the general line? He believes: "The general line for socialist construction is the unity of cost and effect, that is, to achieve the greatest results with the least cost." His so-called "comparison of cost and effect" refers to profit. He bluntly says: "The law of value is actually another expression of the general line." According to his words, profit has become the soul of the general line for socialist construction.

	He plays tricks with empty and real, real and empty, on the one hand, reducing the Party's general line for socialist construction to nothing, on the other hand, replacing it with a "general line" with profit as the soul. This is not the general line for socialist construction, but an unadulterated capitalist "general line" of seeking profit.

	From the analysis of Sun Yefang's "profit-oriented" theory, it can be seen that Sun Yefang attempts to change everything in our socialist economy with profit-oriented management. Profit dominates everything, controls everything, and drives everything. The state, enterprises, and workers all seek profit. Greed for profit is unbearable. "Everyone seeks profit," and socialism is in danger!

	We run enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought, implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, take class struggle and the struggle between the two lines as the key link, insist on emphasizing politics, insist on the socialist direction, insist on the planned economic system, walk the socialist path, avoid revisionism, prevent the restoration of capitalism, and ensure the gradual advancement towards communism. However, Sun Yefang opposes Mao Zedong Thought, raises the black flag of profit-oriented management, regards profit as the content of the general line for socialist construction, makes the purpose of socialist production, investment direction, and planned indicator system all completely subordinate to profit, and makes profit the standard for evaluating the quality of enterprise work, the driving force for developing production, and the means to mobilize people's enthusiasm.

	It is very clear that Sun Yefang is advocating for profit-oriented management, advocating for money-oriented management, advocating for seeking profit, and ultimately advocating for the restoration of capitalism. The struggle between us and Sun Yefang is a struggle between the two lines of socialism and capitalism, a struggle between Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and modern revisionism, and a struggle between revolution and counter-revolution.

	If Sun Yefang's "profit-oriented" theory is realized, then socialist public ownership will inevitably collapse, the socialist planned economic system will inevitably be destroyed, bourgeois ideology will inevitably spread, a bourgeois privileged class will inevitably emerge, and the proletarian dictatorship will inevitably be usurped. In Sun Yefang's own words, the socialist national economy is like a "cow," and profit is like the "nose ring." He wants to hold onto this "nose ring" of profit and lead China's socialist national economy into the abyss of capitalism. This means: to make socialism degenerate into capitalism, to make New China return to Old China, to bury the fruits of the revolution, and to make thousands and thousands of people's heads fall. As Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out: "If this is done, then it will not take much time, a few years or a dozen years at the least, a few decades at the most, to inevitably bring about a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration. The Marxist-Leninist party will definitely become a revisionist party, become a fascist party, and the whole of China will change color."

	We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly smash Sun Yefang's arrogant attack, and pull down his black flag of "profit-oriented" management.

　　“利润挂帅论”剖析
　　东方巍
    中国科学院经济研究所前所长孙冶方，是经济学界反党反社会主义的一面黑旗。多年来，他恶毒地攻击社会主义制度和党的经济政策，顽强地推销他的一整套修正主义经济纲领，狂热地鼓吹利润挂帅。
    社会主义企业如何对待利润，首先是一个政治问题，是关系到企业为谁服务和沿着什么方向发展的重大问题。比如：企业是为革命和建设的需要而完成国家计划的各项指标，还是为增加奖金收入而完成国家计划的各项指标？是着眼于国家需要的品种而超产，还是热中于利润高的品种而超产？是全心全意地为国家的需要和人民的需要服务，还是斤斤计较本企业盈亏？等等。所有这些问题，反映着两个阶级、两条道路、两种经营思想和作风的斗争。实践证明，办好社会主义企业，必须以阶级斗争、两条道路斗争为纲，实行政治挂帅。一个企业如果脱离政治挂帅而一味追逐利润，那么，这个企业必然会从社会主义企业蜕化为资本主义企业。
    孙冶方口口声声地说我们不要利润，这简直是信口雌黄。难道孙冶方跟我们的争论是要不要社会主义利润的问题吗？不！绝对不是。他胡说我们根本不要社会主义利润，是有意把水搅混，好从中贩卖他的私货。利润问题，涉及无产阶级专政国家管理国民经济、办好社会主义企业的一系列根本问题。我们必须对孙冶方的“利润挂帅论”加以剖析，充分揭露其反动本质，把它批透、驳倒。
    怎能用赚钱多少评价企业工作的好坏？
    衡量企业工作好坏的标准，要看是否突出政治，是否严格按毛泽东思想办企业。社会主义企业一定要坚持政治挂帅，实现人的思想革命化，坚持社会主义方向，走社会主义道路，为社会主义建设和广大劳动人民服务。我们工厂的首要任务，就是用毛泽东思想培养和造就无产阶级的革命化的劳动者。必须把工厂办成一座毛泽东思想的大学校。企业工作好坏，首先在于人，在于人的思想革命化。
    而孙冶方却认为，企业只不过是出产品的和赚钱的工具，企业工作好坏要看赚钱多少。他说：“利润的多少，应该是企业技术进步和经营管理好坏的最灵敏的标志”。在他看来，赚钱多的就是先进企业，赚钱少的就是落后企业，不赚钱的就得淘汰。
    在衡量企业工作好坏的标准问题上，我们说人的因素第一，在于人的思想革命化；他说钞票第一，在于企业的赚钱多少。他完全是用资本家那一套来反对按毛泽东思想办企业。
    难道利润是社会主义经济计划的主要指标？
    社会主义经济是计划经济。国家通过统一计划管理企业，使整个国民经济有计划按比例的、高速度的发展。社会主义企业要实行政治挂帅，贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线，全面完成国家的计划指标，必须好字当头，好中求多，好中求快，好中求省，质量、品种第一。
    但在孙冶方看来，社会主义经济计划中的主要指标是利润，是赚钱。他说：利润指标是社会主义经济计划的“中心指标”。这就是说，利字当头，赚钱第一，国家和企业只要抓住利润这个“牛鼻子”，就能带动一切，至于什么产品的品种、质量、数量，他根本没看在眼里。
    我们说，社会主义企业要受国家统一计划的领导；他说，要受利润的支配。我们说，企业经济活动要好字当头，质量、品种第一；他说，企业要利字当头，赚钱就是一切。照他这一套，国家除了见钱眼红，还有什么社会主义计划管理！企业除了成为赚钱工具，还有什么社会主义气味！
    资金利润率是国家投资的依据吗？
    社会主义经济是以生产资料公有制为基础的，生产的目的是“发展经济，保障供给”。因此，国家的资金分配，即生产资料和劳动力在不同生产部门之间的分配，必须从社会主义生产目的出发，根据政治和经济的任务，服从革命和建设的需要，实行计划分配。
    然而，孙冶方却主张国家投资的方向要以赚钱多少为转移。他说：国家“究竟采取哪一种投资方案，分配多少资金，就要作经济比较，也就是要考虑到平均资金利润率”。他要国家哪里赚钱就向哪里投资，对赚钱多的部门就多投资，对赚钱少的部门就少投资，对赔钱的部门即使国家急需也不投资。
    不难看出，他是反对国家根据革命和建设需要分配资金，鼓吹按赚钱多少决定投资去向；反对对国民经济实行计划调节，用资金利润率和生产价格作为国家投资的自动调节器。这不是取消无产阶级国家对国民经济的集中领导，破坏计划经济制度，使社会主义计划经济沦为资本主义自由化经济，还能是什么呢？
    利润岂能调动企业和职工生产的积极性？
    社会主义企业不仅是无产阶级进行生产斗争和科学实验的阵地，而且是进行阶级斗争的阵地。企业完成生产任务，必须以阶级斗争、两条道路斗争为纲，抓革命，促生产，抓革命，促建设。政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。办社会主义企业必须突出无产阶级政治，突出毛泽东思想。通过活学活用毛主席著作，把毛泽东思想灌输到职工群众中去，这样，职工群众的无产阶级觉悟就大大提高了，他们的革命积极性和创造性就充分发挥出来了，精神力量就转化为巨大的物质力量。这是保证企业沿着社会主义方向发展的唯一的、可靠的、持久的动力。
    孙冶方既然把企业作为赚钱的工具，那他就必然要强调物质刺激，把利润作为刺激企业和职工的“积极性”的诱饵。无怪乎他说：“利润是发展生产的必要手段”，“按占用资金的多少来确定向国家上缴利润”，以加重企业对利润的关心；用“超过社会平均水平的那部分利润按一定比例分一部分给企业作为奖金”，以刺激企业职工的积极性。他就是这样把利润作为鞭策企业和职工“前进又前进”的动力。
    我们办企业搞的是革命和建设，靠的是政治挂帅；而孙冶方办企业，搞的是赚钱，靠的是利润刺激。他的这套办法，必将使我国经济脱离社会主义的轨道。
    不许孙冶方歪曲党的社会主义建设总路线
    党的社会主义建设总路线是毛泽东同志对马克思列宁主义的伟大发展。它是对社会主义社会阶级斗争和经济发展的客观规律的创造性运用。它的目的在于充分调动广大劳动群众的主观能动性。它的本质在于对人民群众在建设社会主义事业中的觉悟性、积极性和创造性的高度重视。它是按照毛泽东思想建设社会主义的唯一正确的路线。
    孙冶方象邓拓诬蔑东风压倒西风是“伟大的空话”一样，攻击党的社会主义建设总路线是“虚”的。那么在孙冶方看来，总路线的“实”又是什么呢？他认为：“社会主义建设总路线就是费用和效用的统一，就是以最少的费用取得最大的效果”。他这种所谓“费用和效果的比较”，是指利润。他直截了当地说：“价值规律实际上是总路线的另一种提法”。依照他的说法，利润简直成了社会主义建设总路线的灵魂。
    他玩弄虚虚实实、实实虚虚的把戏，一方面把党的社会主义建设总路线化为乌有，另一方面又代之以利润为灵魂的“总路线”。这哪里是社会主义建设总路线，只能是不折不扣的资本主义唯利是图的“总路线”。
    从对孙冶方的“利润挂帅论”的剖析，可以看出，孙冶方妄图以利润挂帅篡改我们的社会主义经济的一切。利润统帅一切、支配一切、推动一切，国家唯利是图、企业唯利是图、职工唯利是图。利欲熏心，不可终日。“上下交征利”，而社会主义危矣！
    我们是按照毛泽东思想办企业，贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线，以阶级斗争、两条道路斗争为纲，坚持突出政治，坚持社会主义方向，坚持计划经济制度，走社会主义道路，避免修正主义，防止资本主义复辟，保证逐步走向共产主义。而孙冶方却反对毛泽东思想，打出利润挂帅的黑旗，把利润作为社会主义建设总路线的内容，使社会主义生产目的、投资方向和计划指标体系都完全服从于利润，使利润成为评价企业工作的标准、发展生产的动力和调动人们积极性的手段。
    十分明显，孙冶方搞的是利润挂帅，搞的是钞票挂帅，搞的是唯利是图，归根结蒂，搞的是复辟资本主义。我们和孙冶方之间的斗争，是社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想和现代修正主义之间的斗争，是革命和反革命的斗争。
    如果孙冶方的“利润挂帅论”得以实现，那么，社会主义所有制就必定瓦解，社会主义计划经济制度就必被破坏，资产阶级思想必然泛滥，资产阶级特权阶层必得孳生，无产阶级政权必遭篡夺。用孙冶方自己的话来说，社会主义国民经济比作一头“牛”，利润好比“牛鼻子”。他就是要牵住利润这个“牛鼻子”，把中国社会主义国民经济引向资本主义的深渊。这就是：要社会主义蜕化为资本主义，要新中国退到旧中国去，要革命果实被葬送，要千百万人头落地。正如毛泽东同志所指出的：“照此办理，那就不要很多时间，少则几年、十几年，多则几十年，就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟，马列主义的党就一定会变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，整个中国就要改变颜色了。”
    我们必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底粉碎孙冶方的猖狂进攻，拔掉他的“利润挂帅”黑旗。
