On this day, as usual, I went to a British merchant ship to carry out my mission. As I climbed the ship's ladder and walked towards the ship, an elderly British crew member in his fifties came towards me. He greeted me enthusiastically and excitedly told me, "It is an honor to have bought a set of 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' at the Dalian Seamen's Club. These books are wonderful!"

He led me into his room, took out a white cloth package from a drawer, and opened the snow-white cloth to reveal a set of 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong.' He opened the book and said with a firm voice, "I am over fifty years old. Since I was young, I have been sailing to Chinese ports and have seen China's past and present more clearly. Mao Zedong's books tell me how China has risen and become strong; they also teach me how to be a good person. I will study these books carefully."

This British sailor, who had spent most of his life at sea, gently stroked the set of 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' as he spoke from the heart. He said he wanted to take the books back to Britain so that his children and relatives and friends could all study them well.

　　老水手的心愿
　　林家禄
    这天，与往常一样，我到一艘英国商轮去执行任务。当我登上船梯，向船中走去时，迎面走来一位年过半百的英国船员。他主动向我打了个招呼，并以兴奋的心情告诉我：“荣幸得很，在大连海员俱乐部买到了一套《毛泽东选集》。这几本书太好了！”
    他边说边把我引进他的房间，从抽屉里取出个白布包，打开那块雪白的布，一套《毛泽东选集》出现在我的眼前。他翻开了《毛泽东选集》，用坚定的语气说：“我今年五十多岁了，从我年轻的时候起，就一直跑中国的港口，对中国的过去和现在，看得比较清楚。毛泽东的书告诉我，中国是怎样翻身和强大的；还教我应该怎样做人。我要好好阅读这几本书。”
    这位当了大半辈海员的英国人，一边轻轻地抚摸着这套《毛泽东选集》，一边语重心长地倾吐着心里话。他说要把书带回英国去，让孩子们以及亲戚朋友们都好好地学习。
