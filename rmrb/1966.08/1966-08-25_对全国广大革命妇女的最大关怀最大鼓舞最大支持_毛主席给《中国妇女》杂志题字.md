	The Greatest Concern, Inspiration, and Support for All Revolutionary Women Across the Nation
	Chairman Mao's Calligraphy for "Women of China" Magazine

	Revolutionary comrades of the All-China Women's Federation are determined to turn the federation into a grand school of Mao Zedong Thought and to make "Women of China" a red publication that propagates Mao Zedong Thought, serves proletarian politics, and promotes the revolutionization of women's thinking.

	Xinhua News Agency, August 24th: Our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao wrote the calligraphy "Women of China" for the magazine "Women of China" on August 20th. This is the greatest concern, inspiration, and support from our beloved leader Chairman Mao for all revolutionary women across the nation! This is a great joy for all revolutionary women across the nation!

	During this great proletarian cultural revolution, revolutionary comrades of the All-China Women's Federation exposed the anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought clique member Dong Bian, removed her from her positions as the editor-in-chief and director of "Women of China" magazine, and reclaimed this propaganda front. Everyone eagerly hoped that Chairman Mao would write calligraphy for the new "Women of China" magazine. Comrade Cai Chang conveyed this request to Chairman Mao on August 18th. Our great leader Chairman Mao understands, cares for, and supports the revolutionary women's masses the most. After two days, he wrote "Women of China" in large characters with the same pen that has produced countless brilliant works. Revolutionary comrades of the All-China Women's Federation, upon seeing Chairman Mao's calligraphy, were so excited that they repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

	On the morning of the 22nd, Cai Chang, Kang Keqing, Luo Jun, Cao Mengjun, Shen Zizhu, Li Baoguang, Wu Qiu, and Hu Naiqiu, along with revolutionary comrades from the All-China Women's Federation and "Women of China" magazine, carried the calligraphy framed in a red border to the reception station of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. They beat drums and gongs, and joyfully went to represent female workers, female commune members, female soldiers, revolutionary female students, revolutionary female cadres, and revolutionary female intellectuals to express their determination to Chairman Mao. Upon arriving at the reception station, the wide road in front of the station immediately became lively. Shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live the Communist Party of China!" echoed through the sky. Everyone danced the Yangge dance to the beat of the drums and gongs. Comrade Cai Chang excitedly led everyone to sing "The Boat Needs a Helmsman" and danced the Yangge dance with everyone.

	Wu Qiu, the editor-in-chief and director of "Women of China" magazine, on behalf of revolutionary comrades from the All-China Women's Federation and "Women of China" magazine, stepped onto the platform of the reception station and swore to Chairman Mao: We will definitely always read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, turn the All-China Women's Federation into a grand school of Mao Zedong Thought, and make "Women of China" magazine a red publication that propagates Mao Zedong Thought, serves proletarian politics, and promotes the revolutionization of the thinking of female workers, female commune members, female soldiers, revolutionary female students, revolutionary female cadres, and revolutionary female intellectuals!

	Cai Chang, Kang Keqing, and other comrades from the All-China Women's Federation, along with revolutionary comrades from the federation, joyfully went to the reception station of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to represent all women across the nation to express their determination to Chairman Mao, shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"
