Workers at the Tirana Tractor Parts Factory in Albania's capital, Tirana, enthusiastically hailed the Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which was personally presided over by Comrade Mao Zedong, and the communiqué of the plenum. They believed that this was a historic meeting of great significance and a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

The deputy secretary of the party committee of this factory, Koco, said that the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC "enriched and developed Marxism-Leninism because it was formulated under the personal leadership of the great international proletarian leader, Comrade Mao Zedong." He said, "The central committee meeting of the Communist Party of China this time and the documents it published are extremely important. Our party organization has suggested to all party members and all workers to carefully read this document." "This meeting is a great encouragement to the Chinese people and the people of the whole world, and a heavy blow to imperialism and revisionism."

Koco spoke with reverence and affection about Chairman Mao Zedong, the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman of the Chinese people, attending the mass rally in Beijing to celebrate the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat on August 18. He said that Mao Zedong's attendance in military uniform at the rally of a million people in Beijing shows that Mao Zedong is most concerned about the masses, and the masses love their leader the most.

The deputy director of the factory, Marille, said, "All the workers in our factory, like our party conference, are concerned about the central committee meeting of the CPC this time. We have all read the communiqué of this plenum. This communiqué is a precious treasure in the treasury of Marxism-Leninism."

Marille also said that Chairman Mao's attendance in military uniform at the rally of a million people in Beijing on August 18 is a symbol of revolutionary struggle.

Bana, a technician at this factory who once studied at the Luoyang Tractor Manufacturing Plant in China, said, "When I read the news that Comrade Mao Zedong personally attended the rally of a million people in Beijing, I felt very happy. This shows how closely Comrade Mao Zedong is connected with the masses, and how the masses love him."

New China News Agency, August 25th: Brussels news: The organ of the Belgian Communist Party, "The Voice of the People," published the full text of the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on August 19, and commented: "At a time when China is witnessing unprecedented major events—the cultural revolution to make 700 million people, one-fourth of humanity, into new people who create a new socialist society—the meeting of the leading body of the Communist Party of China has special significance."

The commentary said: "Once the masses grasp revolutionary ideas, they will turn them into material force. This is what is happening in China. The Communist Party of China is completing this great task, and therefore it has set an example of persistent revolutionary struggle and an example of carrying the socialist revolution to the end."

The commentary said: "In China, the cultural revolution underway is a new stage of socialist construction, characterized by the unprecedented arming of hundreds of millions of men and women with theory, who firmly believe that it is they, and not anyone else, who are creating their own history."

The commentary said that Mao Zedong Thought "is the product of the entire science of Marxism-Leninism and has universal significance."

It said: "With this doctrine, it is certain that all opportunist tendencies and other countercurrents that may appear in the communist parties of various countries will be smashed and swept away, and the revolutionary line that is firmly loyal to the principles of Marxism-Leninism will be victorious."

    据新华社地拉那二十四日电　阿尔巴尼亚首都地拉那拖拉机配件工厂职工，热烈欢呼由毛泽东同志亲自主持的中共第八届中央委员会第十一次全体会议和全会公报。他们认为，这是一次具有伟大历史意义的会议，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    这个工厂的党委副书记科乔说，中共八届十一中全会发表的公报“丰富和发展了马克思列宁主义，因为它是在伟大的国际无产阶级领袖毛泽东同志亲自领导下制定的”。他说，“中国共产党的这次中央全会和所公布的文件是极其重要的。我们党组织已经向全体党员、全体工人建议，认真地阅读这个文件。”“这个会议对中国人民、全世界人民是巨大的鼓舞，对帝国主义、修正主义是沉重的打击。”
    科乔怀着崇敬和爱戴的心情，谈到了中国人民的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛泽东主席八月十八日出席北京庆祝无产阶级文化大革命群众大会一事。他说，毛泽东同志穿军装参加北京百万人大会，这表明毛泽东同志最关心群众，群众最爱戴自己的领袖。
    这个工厂的副厂长马里列说，“我们全厂职工就像关心我们党的会议一样，关心中共中央这次全会。我们都阅读了这次全会的公报，这个公报是马克思列宁主义宝库中的重要财富”。
    马里列还说，毛主席八月十八日穿军装参加北京百万群众大会，是革命斗争的象征。
    曾经在中国洛阳拖拉机制造厂学习过的这个工厂的技工巴纳说，当我读到毛泽东同志亲自出席北京百万群众大会的消息时，感到非常高兴。这说明毛泽东同志如何紧密地联系人民群众，人民群众又是如何热爱他。
    新华社二十五日讯　布鲁塞尔消息：十九日出版的比利时共产党机关刊物《人民之声》周刊登载了中国共产党第八届中央委员会第十一次全体会议公报全文，并发表按语说：“正当中国出现了人们难以衡量它的深远程度的重大事件：要使占人类四分之一的七亿人变成缔造社会主义新社会的新型的人的文化革命的时候，中国共产党领导机构的这次会议具有格外重大的意义。”
    按语说：“一旦群众掌握了革命的思想，他们就会把它变成物质力量。这就是在中国发生的事情。中国共产党正在完成这个重大任务，因此它作出了坚持不懈地进行革命斗争的榜样，作出了把社会主义革命进行到底的榜样。”
    按语说：“在中国，正在进行的文化革命是社会主义建设的新阶段，这个新阶段的特点是数以亿计的男女史无前例地在理论上武装起来，他们深信，正是他们而不是其他任何人在创造自己的历史。”
    按语说，毛泽东思想“是整个马克思列宁主义科学的产物，是具有普遍意义的”。
    它说：“有了这个学说，就一定能粉碎和横扫可能在各国共产党内出现的各种机会主义倾向以及其他一切逆流，并能使坚定地忠于马克思列宁主义原则的革命路线取得胜利。”
