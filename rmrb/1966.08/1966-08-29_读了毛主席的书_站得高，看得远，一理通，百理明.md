The following articles are written by members of Huangshandong Brigade in Boluo County, Guangdong Province. These articles are sincere and heartfelt, expressing boundless love for our great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

The authors of these articles have suffered immense exploitation and oppression in the old society. Almost everyone has a history of blood and tears. Through long-term practice, they have come to understand a truth: it is Chairman Mao and the Communist Party leading the laboring people to make revolution, removing the "seven layers of stone and seven layers of bricks" that weighed heavily on the laboring people. If the laboring people do not study Chairman Mao's works, they are forgetting their roots. With deep class sentiments, they overcome countless difficulties. No matter how low their cultural level or how old they are, they must study Chairman Mao's works. They study a little and apply it immediately, filling their minds with dozens of Chairman Mao's quotations. No matter what they do, they compare it with the quotations to see if their thoughts and actions are correct. By studying Chairman Mao's works, they resolutely struggle against all old ideas and old notions in their minds, thoroughly eliminate personal interests for public interests, and are determined to become revolutionary farmers. Their deep affection for Chairman Mao's works and their thorough spirit of self-revolution set a good example for us.

I am a mother of six children, forty-one years old. In the past, apart from worrying about my children's meals, clothes, and education, I was busy raising pigs, feeding chickens, and tending my vegetable garden. For trivial matters like children fighting or chickens eating vegetables, I could argue with someone for days and nights, not stopping until I won. Fellow villagers called me "Yellow Hornet Woman." Even the brigade leader was afraid of me. He once said, "I'd rather go up the mountain to catch a tiger than assign work points to Ma Guanmei."

At that time, cadres and my husband criticized me, but I didn't listen to their criticisms. I always thought they were picking on me. Chairman Mao's works changed me! His words touched my heart. Over the past two years, I have changed day by day, becoming completely different from my past self. Recently, the brigade commended me as a model for studying Chairman Mao's works, and fellow villagers elected me as the deputy brigade leader. This is the trust everyone has in me. I must remember Chairman Mao's teaching, "Modesty helps one to make progress, whereas conceit makes one lag behind," and better study and apply Chairman Mao's works.

Why do I love Chairman Mao's works so much? Because I grew up in bitterness. When I was seven, my parents died. I was sold to a rich peasant as a child bride. He disliked me for being small and unable to work, beating and scolding me every day. Later, he sold me to someone else. By the time I was twenty, I was bound and sold to Nanquan, marrying Jin Hua. Of my six siblings, some died and some were sold. By the time of liberation, only my brother and I were left. It was Chairman Mao and the Communist Party who untied the thousand ropes and ten thousand chains from my body, leading us to stand up and become masters. Now, my six children, two are in middle school, two are in primary school, and our lives are improving day by day. Without Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, there would be no family of mine today. The debt of gratitude to Chairman Mao and the Communist Party is heavier than Mount Tai, and it is impossible to repay.

I am illiterate, have many children, and a lot of household chores, making it difficult to study. The brigade leader and the instructor encouraged me, telling me to use the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Moving Mountains to overcome difficulties. I thought, that's right, I love Chairman Mao, and every word of his is the truth. I must make up my mind to overcome all difficulties and master Mao Zedong Thought. Every evening when there are classes, I cook the evening meal in the afternoon and go to class after work. During the lectures, I listen attentively and remember the spirit of the quotations. After class, I have my daughter copy the quotations and read them to me until I memorize them. In the past, my head was used to remember work points. If the accountant made a mistake, I would scold him. Now, I concentrate on remembering Chairman Mao's quotations, and I don't care about work points. I never forget Chairman Mao's words.

Chairman Mao's works teach us how to be a person and how to be a revolutionary. I love reading the "Three Articles" the most. The "Three Articles" help me transform my thoughts every day. The more Mao Zedong Thought in my mind, the fewer bad thoughts there are, and the more I progress. Before liberation, we poor people put down our sickles with no rice to cook, working for the landlords. After liberation, I thought, the landlords have been overthrown, now we are working for ourselves. It was not until I read Chairman Mao's "Three Articles" that I realized I should not just work for myself, but for the revolution, not only for the Chinese revolution but also for the world revolution.

Chairman Mao wants us to learn from Dr. Norman Bethune. Whatever Chairman Mao says, I follow. The first thing is to eliminate personal interests and establish public interests, getting rid of selfish and self-centered thoughts, and doing everything for others. In the past few years, when I saw others clearing wasteland, I wanted to do the same, planting a few patches of ginger every year. Planting ginger is very labor-intensive and requires good fertilizer. This year, I did not clear any wasteland at all. Now, ninety-five percent of the land is collective, and the private plot is only a few square meters, with the best harvest being only a basket or two. It's truly "salt that isn't salty, vinegar that isn't sour." Only the collective has it! My family's urine bucket is full of urine. In the past, I would have taken it to the private plot or wasteland; this year, I thought the urine is warm and good for transplanting, so I took it to the collective when they were transplanting. In the past, the brigade leader called the loudspeaker hoarse, but I still did not go to work. Now, I go to the work site without being called. In the past, I would take the collective's baskets home to use; now, I bring my family's baskets to the collective to carry grain. After work, I help the accountant carry the seedling trays, hoes, and poles back. In the past, when the brigade leader assigned me to cut grass or carry seedlings, I would frown, complaining about the heavy work. This year, the brigade mobilized everyone to go up the mountain to dig holes and plant paulownia trees. That day, I was sick, and the brigade leader did not assign me work points. I thought, this task is very heavy, and some nursing mothers cannot go, leaving only a few people. "The more difficult the place, the more we should go, this is what a good comrade does." Remembering Chairman Mao's words, I suddenly felt full of energy, immediately picked up my hoe, and found the poor and lower-middle peasants' association leader, insisting on participating in digging holes.

Studying Chairman Mao's works has raised my awareness, making me stand tall, see far, understand one principle, and illuminate a hundred. I think of how I used to quarrel over trivial matters every day and find it laughable. Chairman Mao said, "All revolutionary comrades must care for, love, and help each other." In the past, I did not care for anyone and was not united with anyone, which was not beneficial to the revolutionary cause. The saying goes, "Quarreling leads to no good words, fighting leads to no good punches." Quarreling and fighting will hurt the feelings of class brothers and sisters, and the enemy will be happy. So, I took the initiative to make a self-criticism at the villagers' meeting and went to the homes of those I had quarreled with, such as Zhang Gangjiao, who had not spoken to me for years, to make a self-criticism. When I made a self-criticism to Gangjiao, she said, "I also had shortcomings in the past. Chairman Mao said, 'Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution.' Before liberation, we were both deeply oppressed and grew up together. We are not only friends but also the closest class sisters. We should unite and produce for socialism." From then on, we united, loved each other, discussed and planned together, worked together, and studied Chairman Mao's works together.

I love Chairman Mao and believe in Chairman Mao. Every word he says, I follow. Chairman Mao not only made us poor people stand up but also made us stand up in our thoughts. Mao Zedong Thought has transformed my backward thoughts, making me understand why I live and why I work the land. Now, my mind is filled with twenty or thirty of Chairman Mao's quotations. Every day, I work, attend meetings, think about big and small matters, and face big and small difficulties, all of which I compare with the relevant quotations to see if my thoughts and actions are correct.

Studying Chairman Mao's works is a lifelong task. I am still not studying enough, and I am using it even less. I have made up my mind to always study the precious book, forever study the precious book, and let my sons and grandsons study it generation after generation.

    读了毛主席的书
    站得高，看得远，一理通，百理明
    南坑生产队社员　马观妹
    这里发表的几篇文章，都是广东省博罗县黄山洞大队的社员写的。这些文章，朴实、真挚，字里行间，充满了对我们伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想的无限热爱。
    这些文章的作者，在旧社会受尽剥削和压迫，几乎每个人都有一部血泪史。他们从长期实践中，懂得了一条真理：是毛主席、共产党领导劳动人民闹革命，搬掉了压在劳动人民身上的“七层石板七层砖”。劳动人民不读毛主席的书，就是忘本。他们带着深厚的阶级感情，克服重重困难，文化再低，年纪再大，也要读毛主席的书。他们读一点就用一点，脑子里装上几十条毛主席语录，不管干什么，都要和语录对上口，看自己想得对不对，作得对不对。他们读了毛主席的书，坚决同自己头脑里的一切旧思想、旧观念作斗争，彻底破私立公，决心做个革命化的农民。他们对毛主席著作的这种深厚感情，和彻底的自我革命精神，给我们树立了一个很好的榜样。                                                            
                                                 ——编者    
    我是六个孩子的母亲，今年四十一岁。过去，我除了想儿女吃饭、穿衣、读书这些事以外，就是养猪、喂鸡、管自己的菜园。为了小孩打架、鸡仔食菜这些小事，我可以和人家吵上几天几夜，不吵赢不收嘴。社员叫我“黄蜂婆”。生产队长也怕我，他就讲过：宁愿上山捉一只老虎，不愿给马观妹排工。
    那时候，干部教育我，丈夫也批评我。可是，我对别人的批评，都听不入耳，总以为人家专门和我作对。毛主席的书使我转变啦！他老人家的话，句句打动了我的心。这两年，我就是一天天在变，变得和以前真是两个样。最近，大队评我为学习毛主席著作标兵，社员们还选我当生产队副队长。这是大家对我的信任。我要记住毛主席“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，更好地活学活用毛主席著作。
    我为什么这样热爱毛主席的书？因为我是在苦水中泡大的。七岁时父母就死去。我被卖给一个富农做童养媳，他嫌我人小不会做工，成天打我骂我。后来还把我转卖给别人。到二十岁那年，我被绑着卖到南坑，嫁给金华。我兄弟姊妹六人，死的死，卖的卖，到解放时，只剩下我和一个哥哥。是毛主席、共产党解掉我身上的千重绳万重索，领导我们翻身作主人。现在，我六个孩子，两个上中学，两个读小学，生活不断改善。没有毛主席、共产党，就没有我现在这一家人。毛主席、共产党的恩情比泰山还重，谢也谢不完，报也报不尽。只有读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，永远跟着毛主席，把革命进行到底。
    我无文化，儿女一大群，家务一大堆，学习是有困难的。队长和辅导员就来鼓励我，叫我用愚公移山的精神去克服困难。我想，不错，我热爱毛主席，毛主席的话句句是真理，我一定要下定决心，排除万难，把毛泽东思想学到手。每逢晚上上课，我就在中午把晚饭一起煮好，收工回来，吃过饭就走。讲课的时候，我用心听，记住语录的精神。听完课，叫女儿把语录抄回来，再读给我听，直到把当天学的语录背熟为止。以前，我的脑袋是用来记工分的，记分员记错我的工分，我就骂他一顿饱。现在，我专心记毛主席的语录，工分我无心记，毛主席的话我一刻不能忘。
    毛主席的书，教人怎么做人，怎么做革命的人。“老三篇”我最爱读。“老三篇”天天在帮我改造思想。脑子里的毛泽东思想越多，坏思想就越少，人就越进步。解放前，我们穷人放下镰刀无米煮，是为地主耕田。解放后，我想，地主被打倒了，是为自己耕田啦。直到读了毛主席的“老三篇”，我才觉悟过来，知道不能光为自己耕田，要为革命耕田，不但为中国革命耕田，还要为世界革命耕田。
    毛主席要我们学习白求恩大夫。毛主席怎么说，我就照着行。头一条，就是要破私立公，改掉自私自利的思想，做到毫不利己专门利人。前几年，我看见人家开荒心就动，年年都要种上几块姜。种姜很费工夫，还要施用好肥。今年，我一点荒也没有开。现在，百分之九十五的田地是集体的，自留地就那么几厘，收成再好也不过一担一箩，真是做盐不咸，做醋不酸。集体有，才是最可靠的呵！我家那担尿桶积满了尿水，要是过去，早就上到自留地、开荒地了；今年，我想起尿水暖性大，下秧时施用最好，等队里下秧时我就送去了。过去，队长把广播筒叫烂，我还不出工，现在不用人叫，我就到了工地。过去，队上的箩，我收起来自己用，现在我把家里的箩拿出来给队上装谷，收工后还帮助保管员把秧盆、担挑等捡回去。过去，队长安排我打禾、担秧，我就皱眉头，嫌活重。今年，大队号召开发山区，改变黄山洞面貌，动员大家上山去打树洞种桐。那天我病了，队长没有给排工。我想，这次任务很重，有些要喂奶的妇女不能去，剩下没几个人了。“越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”一想起毛主席的话，我全身添了好大的力气，马上拿起锄头去找贫协组长，坚决要求参加打树洞。
    读了毛主席的书，觉悟提高了，就站得高，看得远，一理通，百理明。我想起过去成日为那点鸡毛蒜皮的小事吵吵闹闹，觉得好笑。毛主席说：“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”以前我对谁都不关心，同谁都不团结，是对革命事业不利的。俗语讲，相争无好言，相打无好拳。争来吵去，就会伤了阶级兄弟姊妹的感情，敌人就高兴了。于是，我主动在社员大会上作了检讨，还到“十日吵一架，几年不讲话”的张庚娇和一些人的家里去作了自我批评。我向庚娇作检讨时，庚娇说，过去我也有缺点，毛主席说过：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”解放前，我们同是受苦受剥削最深，同一条苦根长大的，我们不单是朋友，还是最亲的阶级姊妹，我们要团结生产，搞社会主义才对呀。从此，我们团结友爱，亲亲密密，有商有量，一起劳动，一起读毛主席的书。
    我热爱毛主席，信仰毛主席。他讲的每一句话，我都要照着做。毛主席不但使我们穷人大翻身，还使我们思想上大翻身。毛泽东思想改造了我的落后思想，使我懂得活着为什么，耕田又是为什么。现在，我脑子里装着毛主席的二三十条语录，我天天劳动生产，开会，想大小的事情，碰到大小的困难，都要和有关的语录对上口，看自己想得对不对，做得有无差错。
    读毛主席的书是一辈子的事情，我现在还学得不够，用得更不够。我下定决心，要常常读宝书，永远读宝书，还要儿子、孙子世世代代读宝书。
