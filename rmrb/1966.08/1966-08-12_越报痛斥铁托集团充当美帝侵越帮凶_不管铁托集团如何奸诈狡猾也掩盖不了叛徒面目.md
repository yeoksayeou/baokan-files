Vietnamese Newspaper Strongly Condemns the Tito Group for Acting as American Imperialism's Henchman in Vietnam
No matter how cunning and deceitful the Tito group is, it cannot hide its traitorous face

	Newspaper of the People's Army of Vietnam on the 9th published a commentary, strongly condemning the Tito group of Yugoslavia for its criminal activities in acting as the running dog and accomplice of American imperialism in the Vietnamese issue.

	The commentary pointed out that recently, Marko Nikic, the Yugoslavian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, made a speech on Yugoslavian television, trying to defend Yugoslavia's stance on the Vietnamese issue, and even slandering Vietnamese newspapers for attacking Yugoslavia's stance on the Vietnamese issue, going so far as to distort the facts by saying, "The North Vietnamese have accepted foreign influence and pressure."

	The commentary pointed out that Marko Nikic's loudmouthing is "only because we have correctly exposed the Tito revisionist group's shameful traitorous face of acting as the running dog and accomplice of the Americans in the Vietnamese issue."

	The commentary said that Tito has repeatedly donned the masks of the "third force," "mediating force," and "non-aligned force," hypocritically condemning both sides of the war, without distinguishing between the aggressor and the victim, between unjust and just wars. However, in reality, he harbors the intention of shielding and justifying American aggression policies.

	The commentary quoted an Associated Press report stating, "In the past three years, the United States has provided Yugoslavia with twenty billion dollars," and "is also planning to give Tito fifteen billion dollars in military aid."

	The commentary pointed out that this is precisely the generous reward from the American imperialist master to its faithful servant who actively peddles the "peace talks" commodity for it in the Vietnamese issue.

	The commentary said that the Tito group's fact of selling itself to American imperialism has once again been exposed in Marko Nikic's speech on the Vietnamese issue. When they pretend to support the Vietnamese people, they immediately reveal their tails as American running dogs and their hostile faces towards the Vietnamese people.

	The commentary pointed out that the Tito group's role as the running dog of American bandits, claiming to be "not standing on any side" and "not joining any alliance," is precisely the concentrated expression of its policy of betraying the interests of the Yugoslavian people, opposing the national liberation movement, and opposing the just struggle of the Vietnamese people.

	The commentary said that no matter how cunning and deceitful they are, they cannot hide their despicable traitorous face.

　　越报痛斥铁托集团充当美帝侵越帮凶
    不管铁托集团如何奸诈狡猾也掩盖不了叛徒面目
    新华社河内十日电  越南《人民军队报》九日发表评论，强烈谴责南斯拉夫铁托集团在越南问题上充当美帝国主义走狗和帮凶的罪恶活动。
    评论指出，最近，南斯拉夫外交国务秘书马尔科·尼凯集奇在南斯拉夫电视台上发表谈话，极力为南斯拉夫在越南问题上的态度辩解，并且诬蔑越南报纸攻击南斯拉夫在越南问题上的态度，甚至歪曲说，“越南北方接受了外国的影响和压力”。
    评论指出，马尔科·尼凯集奇这样大肆叫嚣
  “只不过是因为我们十分正确地揭穿了南斯拉夫修正主义集团在越南问题上充当美国走狗和帮凶的可耻叛徒面目”。
    评论说，铁托曾屡次披着“第三种力量”、“中间调解力量”、“不结盟力量”等外衣，假惺惺地谴责参战的双方，不分侵略者和被侵略者，不分非正义战争和正义战争，但事实上却是抱着为美国侵略政策进行包庇和辩解的目的。
    评论引用美联社的报道说，“美国在过去三年内向南斯拉夫提供了二十亿美元”，“并且还要给铁托十五亿美元的军事援助”。
    评论指出，这正是美帝国主义主子给积极为它在越南问题上兜售“和平谈判”货色的忠实奴仆的优厚奖赏。
    评论说，铁托集团把自己出卖给美帝国主义的事实，再一次在马尔科·尼凯集奇就越南问题发表的谈话中暴露出来。在它们装模作样支持越南人民的时候，它们立即暴露了它们充当美国走狗的尾巴和敌视越南人民的面目。
    评论指出，铁托集团充当美国强盗走狗的角色，自称所谓“不站在任何一方”、“不参加任何联盟”，这正是它背叛南斯拉夫人民的利益、反对民族解放运动和反对越南人民的正义斗争政策的集中表现。
    评论说，不管它们奸诈狡猾到什么程度，也掩盖不了这种卑鄙的叛徒面目。
