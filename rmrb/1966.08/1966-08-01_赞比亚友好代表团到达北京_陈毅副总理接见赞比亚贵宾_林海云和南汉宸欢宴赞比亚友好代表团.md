He praised the achievements of the Zambian people since independence and their support for the Zimbabwean people's struggle against colonialism and racism.

He said, "Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Zambia, our relations have been developing, and the friendship between our peoples has been strengthening. We thank the Zambian government for advocating the expulsion of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits from the United Nations and the restoration of the People's Republic of China's lawful rights in the United Nations."

Lin Haiyun said, "The Chinese people highly value the friendship with the people of Zambia and all African countries. We pledge to stand with all countries and revolutionary peoples around the world who oppose imperialism, and to fight to the end against our common enemy, American imperialism. We firmly support the great struggle of the Vietnamese people against American aggression and for national salvation."

Minister Chimba, in his speech, conveyed the greetings of the Zambian people and their leaders to the Chinese people and expressed gratitude for the warm reception. He said, "The friendly relations between Zambia and China have a long history, and our relations are indeed close. Our friendship will continue to develop, further deepen mutual understanding, and bear fruit in trade because both Zambia and China oppose imperialism."

Minister Chimba reaffirmed Zambia's government's stance on expelling the Chiang Kai-shek bandits from the United Nations and restoring the People's Republic of China's lawful rights in the United Nations.

He said, "The Zambian government's stance will not waver due to the influence of imperialist forces."
