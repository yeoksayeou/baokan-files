	Our dearest leader Chairman Mao is forever with us. Our dearest Party Central Committee, our dearest Chairman Mao:

	On the night of August 8, your great voice soared over mountains and rivers, reaching our tents and drilling sites. It was like a thunderclap echoing through the deep valleys, shaking our hearts; it was like a red lantern ascending the blue sky, illuminating our eyes. We gained boundless strength, wisdom, and courage. We enthusiastically support the Party Central Committee's decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Dear Party Central Committee, dear Chairman Mao! Though we are separated from Beijing by mountains and rivers, and though we are thousands of miles away, you are forever with us. At every critical moment of the revolution, you always point the way, clearing the path and leading us forward. Now, in this new stage of the socialist revolution, you have issued the battle cry again. This is the great program of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our compass and timely rain for the struggle.

	All of us revolutionary workers are determined to follow your great instructions, to be daring and fearless, to eliminate all the poisons of the old world, and to create a new world. We will seize the revolution and promote production, building our motherland well.

	Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!
	Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China!
	Long live the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought!
	Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!
