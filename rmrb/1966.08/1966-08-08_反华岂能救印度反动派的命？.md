The session of the Indian Parliament, since its opening, has prominently displayed two characteristics: extreme chaos and vehement anti-China sentiment.

The session began with a heated argument in the Parliament, as some members accused the Indian government of being puppets of the United States. Outside the Parliament, five thousand federal government employees marched and protested against rising prices and the devaluation of the rupee. The reactionary policies, both domestic and foreign, pursued by the Indian reactionaries have met with strong opposition from the Indian people, pushing them into an unprecedentedly isolated and desperate situation.

To cover up this predicament and divert the attention of the people, the Indian reactionaries have been loudly shouting anti-China slogans in and out of the Parliament, desperately spreading lies and slanders against China. However, their shouting is hollow and reveals their true weakness.

While slandering and attacking China, the Indian reactionaries have been eagerly currying favor with the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionist clique. Like all reactionaries, they know that to be anti-China, one must collude with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism; and to curry favor with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, one must be anti-China.

However, the more the Indian reactionaries are anti-China, the more they will become mere lackeys and satellites of U.S. imperialism, and the more they will be hated and opposed by the Indian people. Their internal and external crises will become increasingly uncontrollable, and the result will only be that they will lift a stone to drop it on their own feet.

### 反华岂能救印度反动派的命？

    反华岂能救印度反动派的命？
    印度议会会议从开幕以来，突出地表现了两个特点：一个是极端混乱，一个是大肆反华。
    会议一开始，在议会里面，由于一部分议员攻击印度政府是美国走狗，爆发了大争吵。在议会外面，五千名联邦政府职员游行示威，抗议物价上涨和卢比贬值。印度反动派所奉行的内外反动政策，已经遭到印度人民的强烈反对，使自己陷于空前孤立的困境。
    为了掩饰这种困境，转移人民的视线，印度反动派在议会内外大肆叫嚣反华，竭力对中国进行造谣诬蔑。可是他们叫嚷的调门虽然很高，内容却是空空洞洞，这就暴露了他们实在是怯弱得很。
    印度反动派在对中国进行诬蔑攻击的同时，竭力奉迎美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团。印度反动派同一切反动派一样都懂得，要反华，就必须勾结美帝和苏修；而要在美帝和苏修面前讨好卖乖，捞到一点犒赏，就必须反华。
    但是，印度反动派越反华，就只能越来越沦为美帝国主义的走卒和附庸，越来越遭到印度人民的憎恨和反对，它的内外危机也将越来越不可收拾，其结果只能是搬起石头砸自己的脚。
