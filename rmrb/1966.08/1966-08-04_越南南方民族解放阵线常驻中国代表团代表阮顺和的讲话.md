Respected Comrade Guo Moruo, Respected Comrade Liao Chengzhi, Respected Comrade Liang Guobin, Respected Comrade Zhang Chengzong, Respected Comrade Jin Zhonghua, writers and representatives of Shanghai, respected Asian and African writers, and friends:

First of all, on behalf of the Vietnam South National Liberation Front Permanent Delegation to China, we convey the warmest and most militant greetings of solidarity to you and our friends. We also bring the deep friendship of our brothers in South Vietnam who are fighting on the battlefield to the 10 million glorious people of Shanghai.

For twelve years, American imperialism has continuously committed innumerable heinous crimes in South Vietnam and throughout Vietnam. By 1965, American imperialism and its lackeys had conducted 160,000 sweeps, killed 170,000 people, maimed 800,000, and imprisoned 400,000. This means that in South Vietnam, on average, 42 civilians are killed by American imperialism and its lackeys every day. Now, American imperialism's aggressive war is being waged with great ferocity on our beloved southern land. American imperialism is relentlessly conducting large-scale sweeps and implementing the inhuman "burn everything, kill everything, destroy everything" policy. They are sending B-52 bombers to bomb South Vietnamese villages every day. They even use chemical poison gas to massacre our people. Faced with the destruction of our homeland and homes, the people of South Vietnam have no other choice but to rise up and fight for independence and freedom.

The people of South Vietnam, united under the banner of the Vietnam South National Liberation Front, the sole true representative of the South Vietnamese people, have been waging a very arduous struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, and have continuously achieved brilliant victories. From 1959 to 1963, the people of South Vietnam jointly destroyed the "strategic hamlets" and smashed the fascist rule of the American puppet regime. From 1961 to 1965, we have made American imperialism's "special war" fail; and in the 1965-1966 dry season, when the "limited war" just began, we had already defeated the American expeditionary forces, the strongest in the capitalist world.

In just the first half of 1966, the military and civilian people of South Vietnam launched over 9,000 attacks, annihilating 112,000 enemy troops, including 47,000 American soldiers and mercenaries. This means that one-fifth of American imperialism's troops in South Vietnam have been annihilated. On the political struggle front, the people of South Vietnam are also continuously launching offensives, causing the puppet regime to be thoroughly shaken, making the puppet army disintegrate in large numbers, and facing complete collapse, forcing American imperialism into a very difficult situation.

The more American imperialism suffers heavy blows, the more it becomes desperate. It is leading itself to a dead end. It is escalating the war of destroying North Vietnam with air power to the more serious level of bombing Hanoi and Haiphong. But its bombs cannot make the people of South and North Vietnam surrender. On the contrary, the more than 1,260 American planes shot down in North Vietnam have buried the so-called air superiority of the United States and the arrogant fantasy of using the bombing of the North to get out of its predicament in South Vietnam. Because of continuous failures on the battlefields of South and North Vietnam, American imperialism, on the one hand, continues to send more troops to South Vietnam and intensify the bombing of North Vietnam, and on the other hand, promotes the "peace talks" deception. High-ranking officials of the American government and their lackeys, such as Wilson, Sato, and Tito, are running around everywhere, advocating American-style "peace talks." But American imperialism has once again suffered a complete failure. Its "peace talks" deception cannot fool anyone; instead, it makes them more isolated than ever in world public opinion.

All these tactics cannot shake the will of the Vietnamese people. On July 17, 1966, the beloved leader of 31 million Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, spoke the ironclad vow of all the Vietnamese people: "Johnson and his lackeys must understand: they can send 500,000, 1 million, or even more troops to strengthen their aggression against South Vietnam. They can use thousands of planes to intensify the bombing of North Vietnam. But they cannot shake the iron will and determination of the heroic Vietnamese people to resist American aggression and save the nation."

In response to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to the Nation," the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Vietnam South National Liberation Front, representing 14 million people of South Vietnam, solemnly declared on July 20, 1966: "The people of the South are willing to fight alongside our compatriots nationwide, even if it takes five, ten, twenty years, or even longer, to fight the anti-American struggle to complete victory."

After Chairman Ho Chi Minh issued the "Letter to the Nation" and the Chairman of the Central Committee of the Vietnam South National Liberation Front made the declaration, the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation is developing with unprecedented momentum. With such determination and momentum, the Vietnamese people will certainly deal a heavier blow to American imperialism.

Friends:

In our struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, our close neighbor and brother—the Chinese people—have always been ready to provide us with the greatest, strongest, and most effective support. We, the people of South Vietnam, are very grateful for this. Chairman Mao Zedong's statement on August 29, 1963, and Chairman Liu's statement on July 22, 1966, as well as the massive rallies attended by millions of people throughout China, are brilliant manifestations of this precious support. The people of South Vietnam clearly know that under the leadership of the Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party headed by our beloved Chairman Mao, the 700 million brotherly Chinese people and the 10 million people of Shanghai are holding their guns, ready to make all sacrifices and endure all hardships to support the Vietnamese people in their struggle against American imperialism until complete victory is achieved. The people of South Vietnam regard this as a reliable backing and great support.

We, the people of South Vietnam, are very grateful to the peoples of Asian and African countries, who stand on the front line of the struggle against American imperialist aggression, for their sympathy and support for our struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. The strong voices of Asian and African writer friends condemning American imperialist aggression and the resolution on the Vietnam issue passed at the recent emergency meeting of Asian and African writers in Beijing have excellently demonstrated the solidarity and militant friendship of the peoples of Asian and African countries with the people of South Vietnam. Please allow me to express, on behalf of the people of South Vietnam, our sincere thanks to the Asian and African writer friends present here, and through you, to the peoples of your countries.

The Vietnamese nation is living in a historically significant moment! The motherland, Vietnam, is calling! The entire Vietnamese people have risen! The eyes of the entire progressive humanity are on Vietnam! All the Vietnamese people have risen! The entire progressive humanity is looking forward to Vietnam, strongly condemning American imperialism and resolutely supporting Vietnam! The people of South Vietnam have never been as confident as they are today: the American aggressor troops will definitely be driven out of South Vietnam, and the Vietnamese people will definitely fulfill their sacred duty, which is to liberate the South, defend the North, reunify the country, and make active contributions to the national liberation movements of the peoples of Asian and African countries and the world.

Vietnam will win! American imperialism will be defeated!

Long live the militant friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China!

Long live the fighting spirit of the peoples of Asian and African countries against imperialism and old and new colonialism!

### 越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团代表阮顺和的讲话

      越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团代表阮顺和的讲话尊敬的郭沫若先生，尊敬的廖承志先生，尊敬的梁国斌先生，尊敬的张承宗先生，尊敬的金仲华先生，上海的作家们和代表们，尊敬的亚非作家们，朋友们：
    首先，我们代表越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团向诸位和朋友转达越南南方人民的最热烈的战斗团结的敬意。我们也把正在战斗的越南南方兄弟的深厚友谊带给一千万光荣的上海市人民。
    十二年来，美帝国主义已经连续不断地在越南南方和越南全国犯下了擢发难数的滔天罪行。到一九六五年止，美帝国主义及其走狗已进行了十六万次扫荡，有十七万人被杀害，八十万人被弄成残废，四十万人被监禁。这样在越南南方平均每天都要有四十二个平民被美帝国主义及其走狗杀害。现在，美帝国主义的侵略战争正在我们亲爱的南方土地上十分激烈地进行着。美帝国主义接连不断地进行大规模扫荡，实行惨无人道的“烧光、杀光、毁光”的政策。他们每天都在派遣B—52型飞机对越南南方的村庄进行狂轰滥炸。他们甚至还使用化学毒气来残杀我们的人民。面对国土和家园遭到破坏的局势，越南南方人民除了起来用斗争取得独立和自由而外，没有任何其他出路。
    团结在越南南方人民唯一的真正的代表、越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜下的越南南方人民已经进行极其艰苦的抗美救国的抗战，并且不断地取得了十分光辉的胜利。从一九五九年到一九六三年，越南南方人民一同起来捣毁“战略村”，砸碎了美伪集团的法西斯统治的基础。从一九六一年到一九六五年，我们已使美帝国主义的“特种战争”遭到破产；并且在一九六五年到一九六六年的旱季，即在“局部战争”刚开始的时候就已打败了在资本主义世界最强大的美国远征军。
    仅仅在一九六六年上半年的六个月之内，越南南方军民就出击达九千多次，消灭十一万二千名敌人，其中有四万七千名美国兵和帮凶军。这就是说，美帝国主义现在在越南南方的军队的五分之一已经被消灭。在政治斗争战线上，越南南方人民也不断展开攻势，使傀儡政权遭到彻底动摇，使伪军大批大批地瓦解，并且正面临完全崩溃，迫使美帝国主义处在十分困窘的境地。
    美帝国主义越是遭到沉重的打击它就越是疯狂。它正在把自己引上冒险的穷途末路。它正在把用空军破坏越南北方的战争推向轰炸河内和海防的更严重程度。但是它的炸弹绝不能使越南南方和北方人民屈服。相反在越南北方被击落的一千二百六十多架美国飞机已经埋葬了美国的所谓空中优势和用轰炸北方来摆脱它在越南南方困境的狂妄幻想。因为在越南南方和北方两个战场上不断遭到失败，美帝国主义一方面继续向越南南方增派军队和加紧轰炸越南北方，同时推行“和平谈判”的骗局。美国政府的高级人物及其走卒威尔逊、佐藤、铁托……等到处奔走，鼓吹美国式的“和平谈判”。但是美帝国主义又一次遭到了完全的失败。它的“和平谈判”的欺骗手段骗不了任何人，相反，更加使它们在世界舆论面前空前孤立。
    所有这些手段都不能动摇越南人民的意志。一九六六年七月十七日三千一百万越南人民的敬爱的领袖胡志明主席已说出了全越南人民的钢铁誓言：“约翰逊和他的走狗必须懂得：他们可以出动五十万、一百万或者更多的军队来加强对越南南方的侵略战争。他们可以使用成千架飞机来加强对越南北方的轰炸。但是，他们绝不能动摇英雄的越南人民抗美救国的钢铁意志和决心。”
    为了响应胡志明主席的《告全国同胞书》，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团代表一千四百万越南南方人民，于一九六六年七月二十日庄严声明：“南方人民愿与全国同胞一起，即使要战斗五年、十年、二十年或者更长的时间，也决心把抗美斗争进行到彻底胜利。”
    在胡志明主席发表《告全国同胞书》和越南南方民族解放阵线中央主席团主席发表声明以后，越南人民的抗美救国斗争，正以前所未有的威力蓬勃发展。越南人民以这样的决心，这样的气势，一定会给予美帝国主义以更沉重的打击。
    朋友们：
    在我们的抗美救国斗争中，我们唇齿相依的邻邦兄弟——中国人民一向随时准备给我们以最巨大、最强大和最有效的支持，对此我们越南南方人民表示非常感谢。毛泽东主席一九六三年八月二十九日发表的声明和刘主席一九六六年七月二十二日发表的声明，以及有千百万人参加的，遍及全中国的声势浩大的集会，就是这一宝贵支持的光辉表现。越南南方人民很清楚地知道，在以敬爱的毛主席为首的中国政府和中国共产党的领导下，兄弟的七亿中国人民和一千万的上海人民，正在紧握手中枪，随时准备承担一切牺牲和艰苦，支持越南人民进行反对美帝国主义的斗争，直到取得完全胜利。越南南方人民把这看作是可靠的后盾，伟大的支持。
    我们越南南方人民非常感谢亚非各国人民，他们站在反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争前线，对我国人民的抗美救国斗争已经给予了同情和支持。亚非作家朋友们谴责美帝国主义侵略的强大呼声和最近在北京召开的亚非作家紧急会议通过的关于越南问题的决议，出色地表现了亚非各国人民对越南南方人民的团结和战斗友谊。请允许我向在座的亚非作家朋友们，并通过你们，向你们国家的人民转达越南南方人民的真诚感谢。
    越南民族生活在一个具有重大历史意义的时刻！祖国，越南在召唤！整个越南的人民站起来了！整个进步人类的眼睛注视着越南！全体越南人民已经站起来了！整个进步人类向往着越南，他们强烈谴责美帝国主义和坚决支持越南！越南南方人民从来没有象今天那样坚信：美国侵略军一定被赶出越南南方，越南人民一定能够实现自己神圣的义务，那就是解放南方，保卫北方，统一祖国和为亚非各国人民和世界人民的民族解放运动作出积极的贡献。
    越南必胜！美帝国主义必败！
    越中两国人民战斗友谊万岁！
    亚非各国人民反对帝国主义，新老殖民主义的战斗精神万岁！
