The delegation of the Congolese (Brazzaville) National Assembly, led by President of the National Assembly Muabi Andre George and his wife, along with other members of the delegation, visited the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Museum in Beijing this afternoon.

The Congolese friends first visited the comprehensive exhibition hall, where they learned about the glorious path of the people's revolutionary wars led by the Communist Party of China and the great leader Chairman Mao, from victory to victory. They also visited the Anti-US Aid Korea Exhibition Hall and the Armaments Exhibition Hall.

After the visit, Muabi Andre George, President of the National Assembly, inscribed a message for the museum. The message read: "This visit has made us realize that the anti-imperialist struggle of the Chinese people is great, the Chinese people are brave, and it has made us realize the great thoughts and great abilities of Chairman Mao Zedong, this outstanding leader."

President Muabi praised the Chinese people for "caring for and supporting the people who are still suffering from oppression." He also wrote in his message: "We wish the Red Army and militia of the Chinese people greater achievements. The peace of the world to a great extent will depend on the Red Army and militia of the Chinese people. Long live great China! Long live Comrade Mao Zedong!"

President Muabi and other Congolese friends, accompanied by Vice Chairman Liu Ningyi, were warmly welcomed by the museum's officials when they arrived at the military museum.

The Congolese parliamentary delegation also visited a cotton textile mill in Beijing this morning.
