Chairman Hu praises Sea Defense soldiers and civilians for severely punishing American air pirates

	The Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly condemns U.S. aircraft's continuous bombing of Hai Phong and the demilitarized zone

	Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 6th - Vietnamese Democratic Republic Chairman Ho Chi Minh wrote a letter on August 5th to the soldiers and civilians of Hai Phong, representing the Vietnamese Labor Party Central Committee and the government to commend them for their brilliant achievements in shooting down nine American pirate aircraft from August 2nd to 5th.

	By August 5th, Hai Phong had shot down a total of fifty American pirate aircraft.

	In his letter, Chairman Hu praised the soldiers and civilians of Hai Phong for fighting well and making significant progress in air defense and maintaining order and public security.

	Chairman Hu's letter pointed out that the vicious American pirates will continue to plot many schemes and will bomb Hai Phong. The soldiers and civilians of Hai Phong must always be vigilant, fight better, produce better, maintain order and public security better, and achieve more and greater victories.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 5th - The Vietnamese Democratic Republic Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on August 5th, strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists' third bombing of Hai Phong City and their continued escalation of the war in North Vietnam.

	The statement said that on the morning of August 2nd, at 6:00 AM, multiple batches of U.S. aircraft took off from the ships of the Seventh Fleet and launched the third attack on Hai Phong City. They barbarically bombed densely populated areas, power stations, cement factories, and shipyards, causing several deaths, including sixteen children, and many injuries. Dozens of civilian houses were destroyed.

	The statement said that it is obvious that the dying American pirates are trying to save the U.S. expeditionary forces mired in the quagmire in South Vietnam and threaten the Vietnamese people. However, the entire Vietnamese people are determined to respond to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's sacred call to save the country, stand up together, and are determined to defeat the American aggressors, defend the independence and freedom of the motherland, and fulfill the obligations undertaken for the national liberation movement and world peace.

	The statement concluded: "The leaders of the U.S. government must bear full responsibility for the countless crimes they have committed in Vietnam."

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 3rd - The spokesperson for the Vietnamese Democratic Republic Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on August 2nd, strongly protesting the recent barbaric crimes of U.S. B-52 aircraft continuously bombing the demilitarized zone.

	The statement said that on July 30th, starting at 4:10 AM, U.S. B-52 aircraft continuously bombed a region in the southern part of the demilitarized zone, about one kilometer from the Bach Dang River and more than twenty kilometers from the eastern coast, five times.

	On July 31st, also around 4:10 AM, B-52 aircraft again bombed many places in the northern part of the demilitarized zone. More than forty houses of villagers in Vinh U Commune, Vinh Linh District, were destroyed.

	The statement said that the Vietnamese Democratic Republic Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly condemns and firmly protests the extremely serious war- escalating actions of U.S. imperialism in the demilitarized zone, and declares that the U.S. government must bear full responsibility for all consequences arising from this.

    胡主席表扬海防军民严惩美国飞贼
    越南外交部强烈谴责美机连续轰炸海防和非军事区
    新华社河内六日电　越南民主共和国主席胡志明五日写信给海防市军民，代表越南劳动党中央和政府表彰他们从八月二日至五日击落美国强盗飞机九架的辉煌战绩。
    截至八月五日，海防已击落五十架美国强盗飞机。
    胡主席在信中赞扬海防军民战斗得好，在人民防空和保卫秩序、治安方面取得了许多进步。
    胡主席的信件指出，凶恶的美国强盗还会玩弄许多阴谋，还会轰炸海防。海防军民必须时刻提高警惕，更好地战斗，更好地生产，更好地保卫秩序治安，取得更多更大的成绩。
    据新华社河内五日电　越南民主共和国外交部五日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义第三次轰炸海防市和继续在越南北方进行战争“升级”的行动。
    声明说，八月二日早晨六时，从第七舰队的军舰上起飞的美国飞机多批，对海防市进行了第三次袭击。它们极其野蛮地轰炸了居民稠密区、变电站、水泥厂和造船厂，使一些人死亡，其中有十六名儿童，并有许多人受伤，数十间民房被炸毁。
    声明说，很显然，垂死挣扎的美国强盗妄图以此来挽救正在越南南方深陷泥潭的美国远征军，威胁越南人民。但是，越南全国人民决心响应胡志明主席的神圣救国号召，一齐起来，决心战胜美国侵略强盗，保卫祖国的独立、自由，完成对民族解放运动和世界和平所承担的义务。
    声明最后说：“美国政府首脑必须对它们在越南犯下的无数罪行承担全部责任”。
    据新华社河内三日电　越南民主共和国外交部发言人二日发表声明，强烈抗议美国侵略强盗B—52型飞机近日来连续轰炸非军事区的野蛮罪行。
    声明说，七月三十日，从凌晨四时十分起，美国B—52型飞机接连对距离边海河一公里附近、距东部沿海二十多公里的非军事区南部的一个地区进行了五次轰炸。
    七月三十一日，也是在凌晨四时十分左右，B—52型飞机又对非军事区北部的许多地方进行了两次轰炸，永灵区永乌乡许多村民的四十多栋房屋被炸毁。
    声明说，越南民主共和国外交部强烈控诉和坚决抗议美帝国主义对非军事区进行的极其严重的扩大战争的行动，并且声明：美国政府必须对由此而引起的一切后果承担全部责任。
