Editor's Note: The film "Two Families," released in 1963, is a poisonous weed. The film's director, Lin Shan, along with two others (using the pseudonym Lin Mo Chen), stood on the reactionary grounds of the landlord and bourgeoisie, raising the black flag of counter-revolution, vigorously advocating the "superiority" of the capitalist road, spreading the "single farming" wind, viciously attacking the socialist system, and openly inciting the overthrown class enemies to seize back the "heaven" they had lost from the hands of the revolutionary people.

Changchun Film Studio is one of the earliest film studios built in the liberated areas. Under the leadership of the Party, it has produced some excellent films. Why did it later produce so many poisonous weeds? This is because the henchmen of the black gang led by Zhou Yang, Lin Mo Han, Xia Yan, and Chen Huang Mei—representatives of the bourgeoisie, Lin Shan—usurped the leadership of this studio, stubbornly resisting the Mao Zedong literary line, thus turning this studio into a base for poisonous weeds.

Now, "Two Families" is being screened again as a negative example. We must use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to thoroughly eliminate the poison of the literary black line led by Zhou Yang, thoroughly criticize this poisonous weed, burn it to ashes, and turn it into fertilizer. This is at least a small "contribution" from these ghosts and demons to the people! All erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, all ghosts and demons, must be criticized and cannot be allowed to spread freely.

We and They Are Irreconcilable "Two Families"

The film "Two Families" is a complete attack on the Party, a slander of us poor and lower-middle peasants, an attack on socialism, and a call for the restoration of capitalism. Only those who speak for the landlord class and the bourgeoisie can produce such a film.

In 1952, the Party called on us to organize. Some poor peasants in our village were the first to set up mutual aid teams. Later, we saw in the newspapers that other provinces had cooperatives, which we thought were better than mutual aid teams, so we wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, expressing our determination to set up a cooperative. Chairman Mao had the Party Central Committee Office reply with a letter, encouraging our enthusiasm for the socialist road. Chairman Mao's warm care was the greatest encouragement to us poor and lower-middle peasants. We immediately set up a cooperative, which was one of the earliest in the province. Other poor and lower-middle peasants saw the advantages of the cooperative and eagerly requested to set up and join cooperatives. Everyone said, "Land reform was the first liberation, setting up a cooperative was the second liberation." Setting up a cooperative was the most enthusiastic demand of us poor and lower-middle peasants. However, in the film "Two Families," the poor peasant Gao Zhengguo, upon hearing about setting up a cooperative, immediately fell ill. This is not at all like a poor peasant! I think the film's director deliberately slanders the poor and lower-middle peasants, portraying us as not listening to the Party and being so resistant to setting up a cooperative. That Gao Zhengguo insists on taking the capitalist road, seeking personal wealth, and the film does not criticize him at all. This is not a public call for the restoration of capitalism?

Why did they make such a film? What is their purpose? I want to expose them. This film is based on the novel "Bridge." In 1953, the novelist came to our village to "immerse himself in life" for a year; in 1963, the screenwriter and director of "Two Families" also came here. They wrote about the affairs of our village. They all came to my house, taking photos of my family's pigs and chickens. I originally thought they were here to portray the new life of the poor and lower-middle peasants, so I enthusiastically entertained them. I never expected that while they were taking photos, they were covering their noses with handkerchiefs. They did not listen to the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants at all and were completely different from us. Now we see clearly that they are not our people, the poor and lower-middle peasants, but the people of the landlord and bourgeoisie. We and they are irreconcilable "two families"! Their purpose in making this film is to attack the Party, attack socialism, slander us poor and lower-middle peasants, and to restore capitalism, allowing those landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to climb back on top of us. This is a delusion! We must block this evil path, smash their plots, and eliminate this group of ghosts and demons!

### 我们和他们是不共戴天的“两家人”

专栏：

    编者按：电影《两家人》，是一九六三年出笼的一株大毒草。电影的编导者林杉等三人（化名为林漠晨），站在地主和资产阶级的反动立场上，扯起了反攻倒算的黑旗，大肆鼓吹资本主义道路的“优越性”，大刮“单干风”，恶毒攻击社会主义制度，公开煽动被推翻的阶级敌人起来从革命人民手中夺回他们已经失去了的“天堂”。
    长春电影制片厂是解放区最早建成的一个电影厂。在党的领导下，它曾经拍摄过一些优秀影片。为什么以后又出了很多毒草呢？这是因为周扬、林默涵、夏衍、陈荒煤等黑帮分子们的爪牙——资产阶级代表人物林杉，窃踞了这个厂的领导，顽强地抗拒毛泽东文艺路线，从而使这个厂成了毒草丛生的一个基地。
    现在，《两家人》再一次作为反面教材公映了。我们要以毛泽东思想为武器，彻底肃清以周扬为首的文艺黑线的流毒，彻底批判这株毒草，把它烧成灰烬，变成肥料。这总算是这帮牛鬼蛇神们对人民的一点“贡献”吧！凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。
    我们和他们是不共戴天的“两家人”
    云南晋宁县晋城人民公社管理委员　李凤仪
    电影《两家人》，完完全全是在攻击党，污蔑我们贫下中农，攻击社会主义，鼓吹资本主义复辟。只有替地主阶级、替资产阶级说话的人，才搞得出这种电影来。
    一九五二年，党号召我们组织起来，我们小寨乡的一些贫农首先办起了互助组。后来，我们看到报上介绍外省的合作社，觉得比互助组好，就写信给毛主席，表示要办社的决心。毛主席叫党中央办公厅回了一封信，鼓励我们走社会主义道路的积极性。毛主席的亲切关怀，对我们贫下中农是最大的鼓舞，我们马上办起了合作社。这是全省最早出现的合作社之一。其他的贫下中农亲眼看到了合作社的优越性，都积极要求办社和入社，大家都说：“土改是第一次翻身，办社是第二次翻身。”办社是我们贫下中农最积极的要求。可是在《两家人》这个影片里，那个贫农高正国，一听到办社，急得马上躺倒了，这哪儿有半点贫农的样子！我看影片编导人就是存心污蔑贫下中农，把我们贫下中农说成不听党的话，说成对办社那么抵触。那个高正国，坚持走资本主义道路，搞他个人的发家致富，影片里对他一点也没有批判，这不是公开鼓吹资本主义复辟吗？
    那些人为什么要搞这样的影片？目的是什么？我要揭露他们。这个影片是根据小说《桥》改编的。一九五三年，小说作者曾经到我们小寨乡来“深入生活”一年；一九六三年，《两家人》的编剧、导演，又到我们这儿来过。他们写的就是我们小寨乡的事。他们都到我家里来过，拿照相机照了我家的猪鸡。我原来以为他们是来表现我们贫下中农新生活的，就热情招待，想不到他们一面照相，一面拿手帕捂着鼻子。他们根本不听贫下中农的意见，跟贫下中农就是“两家人”。现在我们可看清楚了，他们不是我们贫下中农的人，而是地主资产阶级的人。我们和他们，就是不共戴天的“两家人”！他们搞这个影片的目的，就是为了攻击党，攻击社会主义，污蔑我们贫下中农，就是为了搞资本主义复辟，让那些地富反坏重新爬到我们头上来。这是妄想！我们一定要堵塞你们这条邪路，粉碎你们的阴谋，消灭你们这帮牛鬼蛇神！
