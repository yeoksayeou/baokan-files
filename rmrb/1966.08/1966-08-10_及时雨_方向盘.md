After hearing the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we are overjoyed, leaping with excitement, and cannot help but shout: Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years of long life!

The wise decision of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao is the great guideline for our country's current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a document of great historical significance in the new stage of the socialist revolution, and a new development of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We resolutely support this decision, resolutely execute this decision, enthusiastically propagate this decision, and bravely defend this decision.

At a time when we desperately need the Party's policy, our beloved Party Central Committee and wise leader Chairman Mao have issued the decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Party Central Committee's decision is like timely rain, a steering wheel guiding our current revolutionary actions, with every word and sentence resonating in our hearts.

Beloved Party Central Committee, wise leader Chairman Mao, we resolutely respond to your great call. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that touches people's souls, we must be bold, daring to charge, daring to forge ahead, daring to revolutionize, and daring to struggle. We must dare to "suffer a thousand cuts" and dare to "pull the emperor off his horse." We will resolutely fight to overthrow, smash, and expose the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, overthrow the academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, and reform the old educational system and old teaching principles and methods. We will fulfill the glorious mission bestowed upon us by history.

We pledge to the Party and our beloved great leader Chairman Mao: We will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

Long live the great Communist Party of China!

Long live Chairman Mao!
