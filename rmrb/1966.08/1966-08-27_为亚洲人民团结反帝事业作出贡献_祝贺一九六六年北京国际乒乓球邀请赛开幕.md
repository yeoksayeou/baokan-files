The 1966 Beijing International Table Tennis Invitational opens today. We warmly welcome the friends from twelve countries and regions in Asia and eagerly anticipate the success of this invitational tournament.

Currently, the revolutionary situation in the Asian region is excellent, and the global revolutionary situation is also excellent. The revolutionary movements of the peoples of various countries, especially the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, are flourishing. The frenzied counterattacks by imperialism, reactionaries of various countries, and modern revisionism cannot stop the revolutionary tide of the peoples of various countries. They are inevitably heading towards total collapse and annihilation.

Under such excellent revolutionary conditions, holding the 1966 Beijing International Table Tennis Invitational will certainly better promote the unity of athletes and peoples of various Asian countries. Athletes from various countries not only bring exquisite skills but also bring the shared will and aspirations of the peoples of various Asian countries to unite against imperialism, and bring the friendship of the peoples of various countries towards the Chinese people. During the invitational, athletes from various countries will, through competitions and various friendly activities, strengthen unity, deepen understanding, enhance friendship, and promote skills. This invitational not only inherits the good tradition of joint training from the previous invitational but also breaks the conventional practice, changing the situation where only a few countries monopolize the seed players internationally. This is a pioneering method that greatly benefits unity. We believe that with the joint efforts of friends from various countries, the invitational will certainly make new contributions to the common cause of Asian peoples uniting against imperialism and to promoting the development of table tennis in Asia and the world.

Currently, our country is undergoing a magnificent proletarian cultural revolution. In this great revolution, the Chinese people, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are thoroughly criticizing the old world and using new proletarian thoughts, culture, customs, and habits to change the spiritual face of the entire society. This is a revolutionary movement to promote Mao Zedong Thought extensively, which will have a great and profound impact on the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.

Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards total collapse and socialism is heading towards global victory. It is the guiding principle for all our work. Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it transforms into a tremendous material force. In recent years, the Chinese table tennis team has insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively, achieving "starting from the roots and beginning from zero," daring to revolutionize, daring to struggle, being good at struggling, and insisting on walking our own path. In numerous international competitions, they have made contributions to the motherland and the people. In this invitational, we should hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the spirit of modesty and friendliness, strengthen unity, seriously learn from athletes of various countries, exchange experiences, make joint progress, and improve together; at the same time, play with style and skill, strive to achieve excellent results, and work with friends from various countries to contribute to the success of this invitational.

    为亚洲人民团结反帝事业作出贡献
    ——祝贺一九六六年北京国际乒乓球邀请赛开幕
    本报评论员
    一九六六年北京国际乒乓球邀请赛今天开幕。我们热烈欢迎亚洲十二个国家和地区的朋友的到来，殷切期待这次邀请赛取得圆满成功。
    当前，亚洲地区是一片大好革命形势，全世界也是一片大好革命形势。各国人民的革命运动，特别是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的革命运动，正在蓬勃开展。帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义向革命力量的疯狂反扑，决不能阻挡各国人民的革命洪流。它们不可避免地要走向全面崩溃和灭亡。
    在这样大好的革命形势下，我们举行一九六六年北京国际乒乓球邀请赛，一定会更好地促进亚洲各国运动员和人民的团结。各国运动员不仅带来了精湛的球艺，而且带来了亚洲各国人民团结反帝的共同意志和愿望，带来了各国人民对中国人民的友情。邀请赛期间，各国运动员将通过比赛和其他各种友好活动，加强团结，加深了解，增进友谊，促进球艺。这次邀请赛不仅继承了上次邀请赛组织共同练习的好传统，而且将打破常规，改变国际上只有少数国家垄断种子选手的情况。这是一个大大有利于团结的首倡办法。我们相信，在各国朋友的共同努力下，邀请赛必将为亚洲人民团结反帝的共同事业，为促进亚洲和世界乒乓球运动的发展，作出新的贡献。
    当前，我国正在进行轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命。我国人民在这场大革命中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底批判旧世界，用无产阶级新思想，新文化，新风俗，新习惯，来改变整个社会的精神面貌。这是一场大兴毛泽东思想的革命运动，对中国革命和世界革命都将产生巨大而深远的影响。
    毛泽东思想是帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义，是我们一切工作的指导方针。毛泽东思想一旦被群众掌握，就转化为巨大的物质力量。几年来，中国乒乓球队坚持活学活用毛主席著作，做到“从根抓起，从零开始”，敢于革命，敢于斗争，善于斗争，坚持走自己的道路，在多次国际比赛中，为祖国、为人民作出了贡献。在这次邀请赛中，应该更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬谦虚友好的精神，加强团结，认真向各国运动员学习，相互交流经验，共同进步，共同提高；同时，打出风格，打出水平，努力创造优异成绩，同各国朋友一道，为这次邀请赛获得圆满结果而作出贡献。
