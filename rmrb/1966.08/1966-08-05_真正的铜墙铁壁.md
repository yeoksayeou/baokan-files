	The True Iron Wall

	Comrade Mao Zedong said: "What is the true iron wall? It is the masses, the tens of millions of people who genuinely support the revolution." This time, in regions such as Dongjiang in Guangdong Province, the ability to overcome the second major flood since liberation relied on the iron wall built by the revolutionary masses.

	How can tens of millions of people be mobilized and organized to have a unified will and action? This requires a unified guiding ideology that can unite tens of millions of revolutionary masses to carry out the revolution. This ideology is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

	The practice of China's socialist revolution and construction has repeatedly proven this truth: once the broad masses grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they have a firm and correct political direction, they can maintain vigorous revolutionary spirit, and they can produce an invincible force that can overcome all obstacles. The great victory of Guangdong people's flood control struggle is another highly convincing example.

	The Guangdong Provincial Committee, by firmly leading the peasants to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought as the common ideological foundation for unity and revolution, has brought about a tremendous change in the spiritual outlook of the peasants throughout the province.

	When the flood surged and the dikes were in danger, it was Chairman Mao's thought of "resolving to overcome all difficulties and win victory" that inspired the masses to fight tenaciously, holding the dikes and resisting the flood.

	When local interests conflicted with overall interests, it was Chairman Mao's thought of "selflessly serving the people" that guided the masses to resolutely divert the flood into their own rice fields, protecting a larger area of rice fields downstream.

	When the flood receded and production recovery faced difficulties, it was again Chairman Mao's thought of "self-reliance" that inspired the masses to rely on their own efforts rather than asking the state for help, quickly restoring production.

	In summary, the revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the true iron wall. With such an iron wall, we can overcome all natural disasters, defeat all class enemies at home and abroad, and in the three great revolutionary movements, overcome all difficulties and march forward to victory.

    真正的铜墙铁壁
    毛泽东同志说：“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。”这次广东省东江等地区，所以能战胜解放以来的第二次特大洪水，靠的就是广大革命群众筑成的铜墙铁壁。
    怎样才能把千百万群众动员起来、组织起来，有一个统一的意志和行动呢？这就需要有一个能够团结千百万革命群众去进行革命的统一的指导思想。这个思想，就是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    我国社会主义革命和建设的实践，反复证明了这个真理：广大群众一旦掌握了毛泽东思想，就有了坚定正确的政治方向，就能保持旺盛的革命干劲，就能产生无坚不摧无攻不克的强大力量。广东人民抗洪斗争的伟大胜利，是又一个极有说服力的例证。
    广东省委由于坚定不移地领导农民活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想作为团结和革命的共同思想基础，使全省农民群众的精神面貌发生了极大的变化。
    当洪水暴涨，堤围告急的时候，是毛主席的“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的思想，鼓舞着群众，使他们顽强地战斗，保住了堤围，抗住了洪水。
    当局部利益和整体利益发生矛盾的时候，是毛主席的“毫不利己专门利人”的思想，教导着群众，使他们毅然决然地把洪水引进自己的稻田，保住了下游更大面积的稻田。
    当洪水退走，恢复生产碰到困难的时候，又是毛主席的“自力更生”的思想，激励着群众，使他们不向国家伸手，而是靠自己动手，迅速恢复了生产。
    总之，用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命群众，才是真正的铜墙铁壁。有了这样的铜墙铁壁，我们就能战胜一切自然灾害，就能战胜国内外一切阶级敌人。就能在三大革命运动中，排除万难，胜利前进。
