The whole country should be a great school for Mao Zedong Thought. Daqing is a model of a revolutionary school.

Daqing Oil Field is a great revolutionary school of both industry and agriculture, both culture and military, nurtured under the great Mao Zedong Thought. Above all, the key is to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works. Over the past few years, the workers and families of Daqing have diligently studied Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implemented it, enthusiastically propagated it, and bravely defended it. They have used Mao Zedong Thought to build a revolutionary enterprise. This is oil worker Chen Shuxing sharing her experiences of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works at a study session on Mao's writings.

Criticizing the bourgeoisie. The workers and families of Daqing have become the main force of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They are determined to overthrow, smash, and expose the ghosts and monsters occupying various cultural fronts. The Daqing family amateur performance troupe, which performed the play "The Rising Sun," is denouncing the anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought crimes of the ringleader of the literary and art world, Zhou Yang.

Promoting revolution and production. In the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the workers of Daqing have been even more diligent in actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, further deepening their ideological revolution, and achieving one victory after another in production. Look, a new well is about to be born in the hands of the workers of the 1202 drilling team.

Industry and agriculture combined. While developing industry, Daqing Oil Field actively organizes workers and families to engage in agricultural and sideline production. This place is not only a modern petroleum base but also a large farm. This year's wheat harvest has been bountiful again. These are the families of Chuangye Village winnowing wheat.

Picking up the gun to fight the enemy. The workers and families of Daqing remember Chairman Mao's teachings on people's war, achieving universal military service, and being ready to fight and win when called upon. This is the "Daqing People's Militia Division" at the Daqing Oil Field rally in support of the Vietnamese people's anti-American patriotic struggle.

Cultivating laborers with socialist consciousness and culture. Daqing Oil Field resolutely implements Chairman Mao's directive that education serves proletarian politics and combines education with productive labor. It vigorously promotes half-work, half-study schools in the style of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University. These are students from the tenth half-work, half-study school in Daqing learning welding techniques from workers.

　　全国都应该为毛泽东思想的大学校
　　大庆是革命化大学校的榜样
    大庆油田是伟大的毛泽东思想哺育下的亦工亦农、亦文亦武的革命化大学校。千条万条，活学活用毛主席著作是第一条。几年来，大庆职工和家属努力学习毛泽东思想，坚决贯彻毛泽东思想，热情宣传毛泽东思想，勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想办革命化的企业。这是采油工陈淑英在毛主席著作讲用会上介绍自己活学活用毛主席著作的体会。
　　批判资产阶级。大庆职工和家属成为无产阶级文化大革命的主力军。他们决心把盘踞在各个文化阵地的牛鬼蛇神斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。演出话剧《初升的太阳》的大庆家属业余演出队队员，在痛斥文艺界黑帮总头目周扬的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪行。
　　抓革命促生产。在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，大庆职工更勤奋地活学活用毛主席著作，进一步加深思想革命化，在生产中夺得了一个又一个的新胜利。看，一口新井又要在1202钻井队工人们的手中诞生了。

　　亦工亦农、工农结合。大庆油田在发展工业的同时，积极组织职工和家属，大搞农副业生产。这里既是一个现代化的石油基地，又是一个大农场。今年的小麦又获得了丰收，这是创业庄的家属们在扬麦。
　　拿起枪杆能打敌人。大庆职工和家属牢记毛主席关于人民战争的教导，实现全民皆兵，作到召之即来，来之能战，战之能胜。这是大庆油田支持越南人民反美爱国斗争大会上的“大庆民兵师”。
　　培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。大庆油田坚决执行毛主席提出的教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，大办抗大式的半工半读学校。这是大庆第十半工半读学校学生向工人学习汽焊技术。
