The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to the Indonesian Embassy in China, severely rebuking the Indonesian government for attempting to cover up its crimes of destroying, looting, and seizing Chinese representative institutions in Indonesia. The note demands that the Indonesian government immediately return the offices and residences of Chinese representative institutions, compensate for all losses, and ensure that similar incidents do not happen again.

	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, August 2 — The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to the Indonesian Embassy in China on August 1, strongly refuting the Indonesian government's attempts to cover up its crimes of destroying, looting, and seizing Chinese representative institutions in its notes dated May 17 and 25. The note demands that the Indonesian government immediately return the illegally seized offices and residences of Chinese representative institutions, compensate for all losses, and ensure that similar incidents do not happen again.

	The note states: "In the wave of anti-China sentiment stirred up by the right-wing reactionary forces in Indonesia, Chinese representative institutions in Indonesia have been repeatedly subjected to savage attacks, resulting in the loss of a large amount of property and the seizure of nine buildings (including the Military Attaché's Office, the Commercial Counselor's Office, the Chinese Consulate General in Jakarta, the Consulate in Makassar, the Consulate in Surabaya, the Xinhua News Agency branch, the Consulate General's residence, the Ambassador's residence, and a villa). This blatant and wanton violation of international norms has aroused the indignation of all justice-loving people around the world! If the Indonesian government still respects the basic norms of international relations, it should, in accordance with the demands of the Chinese government, publicly apologize, compensate for the losses, and immediately return the seized buildings. Instead of doing so, you have taken a despicable attitude in your note!

		"First, you attempt to cover up your crimes by shifting the blame. You once again absurdly claim that the aforementioned violations of diplomatic privileges were the reactions of the Indonesian people, and that they were caused by the Chinese government allowing some Indonesians to reside in China. This is utterly ridiculous. The destruction and seizure of Chinese representative institution buildings were clearly carried out by your government's military personnel and your official thugs, and many of these acts were committed in broad daylight, which is something you cannot deny. China is a sovereign state and a revolutionary socialist country. The Chinese government allows some Indonesian anti-imperialist revolutionaries to reside in China, which is beyond reproach both legally and in accordance with international customs. You, however, defy common sense and attempt to use this as an excuse to violate diplomatic privileges and international norms, which is utterly untenable. Your actions only prove that you are acting recklessly.

		"Second, you are using delaying tactics, clearly intending to seize Chinese representative institution buildings for an extended period. However, you claim that this is 'purely to protect the buildings of the Chinese representative institutions from further damage,' and that 'if the situation permits, the buildings of the Chinese diplomatic missions will be returned as soon as possible.' You even absurdly propose that 'these problems should be solved on the basis of consultation and in the spirit of consultation.' I ask, is it protection of the premises of the Chinese diplomatic missions to arbitrarily destroy someone else's property, occupy someone else's buildings, and beat and expel someone else's guards? I ask, is it intentional delay to postpone the return of the seized buildings until the situation completely permits? I ask, what exactly do you want to consult about after seizing them so brazenly? Robbers who break into homes should be punished, and those who seize other people's buildings and loot other people's property should return them. This is only natural, and moreover, the matter concerns the violation of diplomatic privileges and international norms, which is not open to negotiation. You actually propose to consult on this, which means in essence that you want us to make concessions to your violence, which is absolutely unacceptable.

		"It should be pointed out that you have also set up serious obstacles to issues that should be consulted. In the past two months, high-level officials of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs have created various excuses and actually refused to meet with Chinese diplomatic representatives. For example, Deputy Foreign Minister Suwito, citing the fact that the Chinese government criticized his speech inciting anti-China sentiment in a note, refused to meet with officials of the Chinese Embassy. Other responsible officials of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs have also repeatedly and unreasonably refused to meet with officials of the Chinese Embassy, seriously obstructing the normal duties of Chinese diplomatic officials. This shows that your talk of consultation is completely false.

		"Third, you have also used threats to set the stage for further violence, demanding that we not truthfully accuse you of your crimes and not make reasonable demands, otherwise 'the Chinese government will be fully responsible for all the consequences that may arise in society.' In short, your intention is that you do not want to solve these problems reasonably and quickly, but rather to escalate anti-China and anti-Chinese sentiment. Such threats will not intimidate anyone. The Indonesian government is free to serve imperialism and insist on being anti-China and continue to act arrogantly, but we will expose your actions wherever you go. Countless facts have proven that your own actions have exposed your ugly face of following imperialism to the peoples of Asia, Africa, and the world. It is indeed very disgraceful for a government of a country to use the violation of diplomatic privileges and the destruction of international norms as a means of coercion in its foreign relations."

	The note points out: "Your note has, in fact, admitted that the Indonesian government is the organizer, director, and planner of the destruction, looting of Chinese representative institution property, and seizure of Chinese representative institution buildings. Your close coordination in diplomacy with your crimes also proves that the Chinese government's accusations against you based on the facts are completely correct."

	The note concludes: "The Chinese government once again demands that the Indonesian government, in accordance with the reasonable demands put forward in the two notes dated April 22 and 24, immediately return the illegally seized offices and residences of Chinese representative institutions, compensate for all losses, and ensure that similar incidents do not happen again. Otherwise, it will further prove that your so-called 'goodwill' is completely false, and you will be responsible for all the consequences that arise from this."

    我外交部照会印度尼西亚驻华使馆
    严斥印尼政府掩盖霸占我代表机构的罪责
    我国政府再次要求印尼政府，必须立即归还我各代表机构的办公处和宿舍，立即赔偿一切损失，并保证不再发生类似事件
    新华社二日讯　中国外交部一日照会印度尼西亚驻华大使馆，严厉驳斥印度尼西亚政府在五月十七日和二十五日来照中妄图掩盖它破坏、抢掠和霸占中国驻印度尼西亚的代表机构的罪行。照会要求印度尼西亚政府必须立即归还被非法霸占的中国各代表机构的办公处和宿舍，立即赔偿一切损失，并且保证不再发生类似事件。
    照会说：“在印度尼西亚右派反动势力掀起的反华浪潮中，中国驻印度尼西亚各代表机构，不断遭到野蛮的侵犯，致大量的财产被抢掠、捣毁，且有九处房舍被霸占（计有大使馆武官处、商务参赞处、中国驻雅加达总领事馆、驻马辰领事馆，驻望加锡领事馆、新华分社、总领事馆宿舍、大使馆官员宿舍和别墅）。这种明目张胆恣意践踏国际关系准则的罪恶事件，已引起世界一切正义舆论的公愤！如果印度尼西亚政府还尊重起码的国际关系准则，理应按照中国政府的要求，公开道歉，立即赔偿损失，迅速退回所霸占的房舍。你们不但不这样做，却在来照中采取了极为卑劣的态度！
      “一、你们妄图以东拉西扯的手法掩盖你方的罪责，把上述侵犯外交特权的暴行，再一次胡说成是印度尼西亚人民的反应，还说什么是由于中国政府准许一些印度尼西亚人居留中国所致，这真是荒谬绝伦。破坏和霸占中国代表机构房舍，明明是你们政府的军人和你们官方御用的暴徒所干的，而且许多暴行是在众目睽睽之下进行的，这是无论如何也推卸不了的。中国是一个主权国家，是一个坚持革命的社会主义国家。中国政府允许印度尼西亚一些反帝革命人士居留中国，无论从法律上，从国际惯例上，都是无可非议的。你们竟违背常识，想以此作为侵犯外交特权，破坏国际关系准则的借口，这是绝对站不住脚的。你们这样做，只能证明你方是无理取闹。
      “二、你们采取拖延战术，分明企图长期霸占中国各代表机构的房舍，但是，却说什么这是‘纯粹为了保护中国代表机构的建筑物免遭更大的破坏’，还说什么‘如果情况完全允许的话，将迅速归还中国外交代表机构的房舍’，甚至荒唐地提出‘要在协商的基础上和本着协商的精神，解决这些问题’。试问，任意破坏人家的财产，占用人家的房舍，殴打和驱逐人家的看守人员，对行凶者不仅不加惩罚，反而举行移交仪式将被霸占的房舍交暴徒组织使用，这难道是对中国外交机构驻地的保护么？试问，把归还所霸占的房舍推之于有待情况的完全许可，这不是有意在拖延吗？试问，你们在悍然霸占以后又提出所谓协商，究竟协商些什么？打家劫舍的强盗，应当受到惩罚，霸占别人房舍和抢掠别人的财物，应当归还，这是天经地义的，况且事关侵犯外交特权和国际关系准则问题，更是不容讨价还价。你们居然就此提出要协商解决，说穿了这就是要我们对你们的暴行作出让步，这是绝对办不到的。
      “需要指出的是，就是对应该协商的问题你们也设置了严重的障碍。这两个月以来，印度尼西亚外交部的高级官员制造各种借口，竟然拒绝接见中国外交代表。例如，外交部副部长苏维托先生，就借口中国政府在照会中对他的一次煽动反华的谈话提出了指责，拒不接见中国大使馆官员。印度尼西亚外交部的其他负责官员，也无数次地毫无道理地拒绝接见中国大使馆的外交官，使中国外交官员执行正常业务受到严重的妨害。这说明，你们满口协商，实际上是完全假的。
      “三、你们还采取了威胁手段，为进一步制造暴行设置伏线，要我们不能再就这些问题如实地指控你方的罪责，不能提出正当合理的要求，否则‘在社会上所引起的一切后果必须由中华人民共和国政府负全部责任’。说穿了，你们的主意无非是说，你们对这些问题不仅不想合理地迅速加以解决，相反，还要加剧反华排华。这种威胁吓不倒任何人，印度尼西亚政府要甘心为帝国主义效劳，执意反华，继续蛮横下去，那是你们的自由。但是，你们做到那里，我们就指控到那里，要我们不反对是办不到的。无数事实证明，你们自己的行径，已将你们追随帝国主义的丑恶面目暴露于亚非和世界各国人民的面前。一个国家的政府在对外关系上竟然把侵犯外交特权，破坏国际关系准则，作为要挟手段，实在是很不体面的。”
    照会指出：“你们的来照，事实上已经不打自招地供认，印度尼西亚政府是破坏、抢掠中国代表机构财产，霸占中国代表机构房舍的组织者，指挥者，策划者。你们在外交上对你们的暴行进行着密切的配合，也证明了中国政府依照事实对你们的指责是完全正确的。”
    照会最后说：“中国政府再次要求印度尼西亚政府，必须按照四月二十二日和二十四日两照会中提出的合理要求，立即归还被非法霸占的中国各代表机构的办公处和宿舍，立即赔偿一切损失，并且保证不再发生类似事件。否则，就更说明了你们所说的‘良好愿望’完全是假话，由此而产生的一切后果必须由你们承担。”
