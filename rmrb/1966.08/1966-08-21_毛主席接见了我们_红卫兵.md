Today is truly the happiest and most joyous day for all of us "Red Guards" and all revolutionary teachers and students! Our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, received us "Red Guards" representatives on Tiananmen Rostrum. The most joyous moment we have been longing for day and night has finally arrived!

At seven in the morning, we "Red Guards" lined up and ascended Tiananmen Rostrum. Our hearts were filled with immense excitement. Our most respected Chairman Mao is about to receive us. This is a joyous event we could never have dreamed of! At this moment, the only thought in the minds of the "Red Guards" was: Chairman Mao is coming, long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years!

At 8:05 AM, "Red Guards" Song Bolin, Luo Xiaohai, and Han Jun could no longer contain their overwhelming excitement and rushed into Tiananmen Rostrum to Chairman Mao's side! As soon as they saw Chairman Mao, they forgot everything and shouted incessantly: "Long live Chairman Mao!"

Chairman Mao stood up with a smile and shook hands with each of them. What powerful and strong hands! It is these hands that wrote the truths of revolution; it is these hands that pointed out the direction of our advance; it is these hands that commanded us to seize the people's mountains and rivers; it is these hands that command us to defend the people's mountains and rivers! Shaking these revolutionary hands, a thousand words and ten thousand thoughts surged in our hearts! All thoughts and words converged into one sentence:

"Chairman Mao is good! Wish Chairman Mao eternal health!"

Chairman Mao smiled benevolently and said, "Good, good, good!"

The "Red Guards" then remembered they had not introduced themselves and hurriedly said, "We are the 'Red Guards' of Qinghua Attached Middle School."

Chairman Mao asked, "Which one?"

The "Red Guards" replied, "The 'Red Guards' of Qinghua Attached Middle School."

The "Red Guards" then shouted in unison, "Wish Chairman Mao eternal health!" and continuously chanted, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

The "Red Guards" excitedly told Chairman Mao, "We will forever be your most loyal little soldiers," "We want revolution, we want to rebel to the end!"

Chairman Mao said, "I firmly support you!" The immense encouragement and inspiration filled the "Red Guards," and everyone forgot everything, with only one thought in mind: "Long live Chairman Mao!" They repeatedly shook hands with Chairman Mao and reluctantly walked out.

"The news that Chairman Mao received us!" spread like lightning. All "Red Guards" instantly became excited. Everyone sang in unison: "The East Is Red," "The Ship Sails on the Sea Depending on the Helmsman," and "Rebellion Song," and unanimously said, "Wish our most beloved leader Chairman Mao eternal health!" On Tiananmen Rostrum, the "Red Guards" were all spirited and sang in unison. Everyone's hearts had already flown to Chairman Mao's side!

At 9:45 and a half, suddenly, the applause was exceptionally loud, and the sunlight was exceptionally bright. Chairman Mao walked towards us! Chairman Mao wore a brand-new green military uniform, with a red badge and red armband shining brightly. Chairman Mao's face was radiant. He was so tall and his steps were so steady. He was truly in excellent health. This is the greatest happiness for the Chinese people and all people of the world. The "Red Guards" jumped, and the slogan "Long live Chairman Mao" echoed through the sky! Everyone held the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" high above their heads, and red light shone everywhere, spreading redness all around! Chairman Mao walked around and slowly ascended the steps. People crowded around. Everyone had only one thought in mind: Quickly! Look at Chairman Mao more! Only one sentence:

"Long live Chairman Mao!" Chairman Mao looked at this group of enthusiastic young revolutionaries and smiled happily.

At 9:49 and a half, Chairman Mao left. Everyone was still not satisfied, and no one wanted to leave. They shouted in unison, "We want to see Chairman Mao!" Premier Zhou came over and said, "I am an old 'Red Guard.' Listen to the command and sit down. Chairman Mao will come to take a photo with you!" Take a photo with Chairman Mao! This is truly a very happy, very happy thing! The great leader cares so much for us young people! He not only took the time to receive us, this group of "little soldiers," but also took a photo with us! Many "Red Guards" could not help but say at once, "If we don't do a good job in the revolution, we will be too ungrateful to Chairman Mao!" "We must carry out the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end! We must not rest until we achieve complete victory to repay Chairman Mao's care!" The great leader's encouragement and inspiration are turning the "Red Guards" into a great material force.

At 11:45, Chairman Mao came to our side again. Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and other leaders all wore "Red Guards" red armbands. The old "Red Guards" led the young "Red Guards," and everyone did the revolution together. Chairman Mao took photos with many "Red Guards" in turn. People were excited and jumped, shouting from the bottom of their hearts, "Long live Chairman Mao!" This is truly our happiest moment. Our great leader Chairman Mao, we "Red Guards" sincerely wish you good health! Eternal life! We will definitely be your most loyal and brave "Red Guards"!

We are all students and have made no contribution to the people. We have done nothing. Chairman Mao not only received us but also took photos with us. Our responsibility is even greater. We must not disappoint Chairman Mao's immense care and trust in us!

In the future, we must study Chairman Mao's works even better, remember every word in our hearts, and honestly follow them. We must be good soldiers and good students of Chairman Mao. In the future, no matter where we encounter great difficulties, as long as we think of today, we will have boundless courage, and no difficulty will be insurmountable. Chairman Mao has given us boundless wisdom and strength. We must hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, go through storms and waves to temper ourselves, and carry out the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end! Carry out the revolution of China and the world to the end!

    毛主席接见了我们“红卫兵”
    清华附中“红卫兵”
    今天真是我们全体“红卫兵”战士和全体革命师生最幸福最幸福的大喜日子！我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席，在天安门城楼上接见了我们“红卫兵”战士的代表，我们日夜盼望的最幸福的时刻，终于来临了！
    早上七点，我们“红卫兵”战士列队登上天安门城楼，心里真是激动万分，我们最敬爱的毛主席就要接见我们了，真是做梦也想不到的大喜事啊！这时，“红卫兵”战士只有一个念头：毛主席要来了，毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    八点零五分，“红卫兵”战士宋柏林、骆小海、韩军，实在忍耐不住无比激动的心情，奔进了天安门城楼，来到了我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席身边！他们一见毛主席，什么都忘了，只是一个劲儿地喊：“毛主席万岁！”
    毛主席微笑地站了起来，和他们一一握手。这是多么有力、多么坚强的手呵！就是这双手，挥笔写出了革命的真理；就是这双手，指出了我们前进的方向；就是这双手，指挥着我们打下了人民的江山；就是这双手，指挥着我们保卫着人民的江山！紧握这双革命的手，千言万语涌心头！千言万语汇成一句话：
   “毛主席好！祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
    毛主席慈祥地微笑着说：“好，好，好！”
    “红卫兵”战士这才想起还没有通名，连忙说：“我们是清华附中‘红卫兵’。”
     毛主席问：“哪一个？”
    “红卫兵”战士说：“清华附中‘红卫兵’。”
    “红卫兵”战士又齐声说“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”还不停地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”
    “红卫兵”战士激动地对毛主席说：“我们永远做您最忠实的小兵”，“我们要革命，要造反到底！”
    毛主席说：“我坚决支持你们！”巨大的鼓舞激励着“红卫兵”战士，大家什么都忘了，只有一个念头道出来：“毛主席万岁！”他们再三和毛主席握手，恋恋不舍地走了出来。
      “毛主席接见我们了！”好消息像闪电一样传开了。全体“红卫兵”战士顿时沸腾了。大家齐声高唱：《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》、《造反歌》，异口同声地说：“祝我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席万寿无疆！”天安门城楼上，“红卫兵”们个个意气风发，同声欢唱，大家的心啊，早就飞到了毛主席身旁！
    九点四十五分半，突然，掌声格外响，阳光格外明亮，毛主席向我们走来了！毛主席穿着一身崭新的绿军装，红帽徽、红领章在闪闪发光。毛主席满面红光，他老人家是那样魁伟，步伐是那样稳健，真是健康极了。这是我们中国人民和全世界人民最大的幸福。“红卫兵”战士蹦跳着，“毛主席万岁”的口号声响彻云霄！人人都把《毛主席语录》高高举过头顶，到处闪耀着红光，红遍四方！毛主席走了一圈，缓步登上台阶，人们拥簇过去。大家心里只有一个念头：快！多看看毛主席！只有一句话：
  “毛主席万岁！”毛主席看着这群欢腾的革命小将，高兴地笑了！
    九点四十九分半，毛主席回去了。大家还不满足，谁也不肯离开，齐喊：“我们想见毛主席！”周总理过来了，说：“我是个老‘红卫兵’。你们听从指挥，坐好。等会儿，毛主席来和你们照像！”和毛主席照像！真是太幸福太幸福的事情啦！伟大的领袖是多么关怀我们青年一代呵！他不仅抽时间接见我们这群“娃娃兵”，还和我们一起照像！许多“红卫兵”战士当即禁不住说：“咱再不好好干革命，就太对不住毛主席了！”“我们非把无产阶级文化大革命搞到底不可！不获全胜，就对不起毛主席的关怀！”伟大领袖的鼓舞，激动着“红卫兵”战士，正在化为巨大的物质力量。
    十一点四十五分，毛主席又一次来到我们身边。毛主席、林副主席等首长，都戴上了“红卫兵”红袖章。老“红卫兵”带着小“红卫兵”，一齐干革命。毛主席依次和许多“红卫兵”战士照相。人们欢腾、跳跃，从心眼里高呼：“毛主席万岁！”这真是我们最最幸福的时刻。我们伟大的领袖毛主席啊，我们“红卫兵”战士衷心祝您身体健康！万寿无疆！我们一定坚决作您最忠实最勇敢的“红卫兵”！
    我们都是些学生，对人民什么贡献也没有，什么事情也没做。毛主席不但接见我们，还和我们照像。我们的责任更重了，我们一定不辜负毛主席对我们的无比关怀和信任！
    我们今后一定要更好地学习毛主席著作，要一个字一个字地牢记在心里，老老实实照着办，一定要做毛主席的好战士、好学生。今后，无论在什么地方遇见了多大困难，只要想想今天，就会有无穷的勇气，任何困难也不在话下。毛主席给了我们无穷的智慧和力量。我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，到大风大浪中去锻炼，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！把中国革命和世界革命进行到底！
