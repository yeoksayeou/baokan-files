Dear Mother,

Today, at the mass rally in the capital celebrating the Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao received us, the entire Red Guards. The leader most beloved by the people of the entire nation and the world, our greatest and most revered commander and helmsman, Chairman Mao, received us, the entire Red Guards! Chairman Mao wore a green military uniform, with a shining red badge on his cap and a brilliant red insignia on his chest. Chairman Mao is in the best of health, with a radiant complexion and a spirited demeanor. He arrived at Tiananmen Gate at five in the morning. Chairman Mao having such good health is the greatest happiness for all the people of the nation and the world!

At 6:55 this morning, we ascended the majestic, solemn, and magnificent Tiananmen Gate. At 10:10, Chairman Mao received us, as did Vice Chairman Lin and Premier Zhou. Chairman Mao walked steadily towards us. I held up a bright red copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in my left hand and pushed forward to present him with a Red Guard armband. On that bright red armband, the words "Red Guard" were meticulously embroidered in yellow thread. On that bright red armband, five different Chairman Mao commemorative badges were neatly pinned. When he took the armband adorned with badges, he smiled at me. The great leader's smile made my blood boil with excitement, my heart pounded, and tears of joy welled up in my eyes. Overjoyed, I didn't know what to do, so I immediately stood at attention and respectfully saluted our brightest red sun, Chairman Mao. Before seeing Chairman Mao, the comrades and fellow soldiers entrusted me to convey their words to Chairman Mao, but at that moment, I couldn't remember a single one. I shouted with all my passion, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!" Later, I felt a bit of pain on my lower lip and realized that I had bitten it while shouting. I also shook hands with Chairman Mao and took a photo with him. His hand was large, firm, and warm. Holding Chairman Mao's hand, my chest burned with the fury to conquer the old world; holding Chairman Mao's hand, my chest surged with the thunder to liberate all of humanity. It warmed my hand, my heart, and my spirit. Mother, you often say that Chairman Mao is our greatest leader. Now I have seen him with my own eyes, and I saw him so clearly and truly. I personally presented him with a red armband and shook hands with Chairman Mao and took a photo with him. Mother, now I am the happiest person in the world. Mother, you must be very happy too! When I return home, you must remember to hold my hand!

Mother, dear mother, when Father and you left Beijing, you told me and my brother: We are the descendants of revolutionary soldiers. Our parents used their blood and flesh to build this country, and the next generation should vow to defend it. We should follow Chairman Mao closely, not taking a single step away. Mother, I am doing exactly as you said. I love Chairman Mao, and I devote all my energy to the Cultural Revolution. Although I still have many personal thoughts and many shortcomings, I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words: "Since we are serving the people, we should not be afraid of criticism. No matter who points out our mistakes, as long as you are right, we will correct them."

Let the day Chairman Mao met with us—August 18—become a milestone in my growth and life! Dear Mother, I will definitely read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. I will be the most loyal and reliable Red Guard for Chairman Mao, just like you were a "Little Red Devil" in your time, fighting for the great and magnificent cause of communism all my life, engaging in class struggle forever, and preparing to fight a lifelong face-to-face battle against the bourgeoisie.

Wish you to be a forever revolutionary "Old Red Guard"!

Let us together wish our most beloved Chairman Mao eternal life!

    我给毛主席献上红袖章亲爱的妈妈：
    今天，在首都百万人庆祝文化大革命的大会上，毛主席接见了我们全体红卫兵战士。全国人民、世界人民最最敬爱的领袖、我们最最伟大的统帅和舵手毛主席，接见我们全体红卫兵战士了！毛主席他老人家穿着一身草绿色的军装，头上的帽徽红光闪闪，鲜红的领章光芒万丈。毛主席他老人家身体非常非常健康，红光满面，神采奕奕。他老人家在早上五点钟就到了天安门城楼。毛主席他老人家有这样好的身体，这是我们全国人民，全世界人民的最大幸福！
    今天上午六点五十五分，我们登上了雄伟、庄严、壮丽的天安门城楼。十点十分，毛主席接见了我们，林副主席、周总理都接见我们了。毛主席他老人家迈着稳健的步伐走到我们跟前。我左手擎着鲜红的《毛主席语录》，挤了上去，向他老人家献上了一个红卫兵的袖章。在那鲜红的袖章上，用黄色的丝线精心绣着红卫兵三个大字。在那鲜红的袖章上，整齐地别上了五枚不同的毛主席纪念章。当他老人家接过那缀满纪念章的鲜红袖章时，对我微微一笑。伟大领袖的微笑，激动得我热血沸腾，激动得我心咚咚地跳，欢喜的泪花滴溜溜转。高兴的我呀不知道怎么才好，马上立正，给我们心中最红最亮的红太阳毛主席他老人家恭恭敬敬地敬了一个礼。在见毛主席之前，同志们、战友们委托我告诉毛主席的话，这时候一句也记不起来了。我用我的全部热情高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！”事后我感觉下嘴唇有点痛，才知道高呼时把嘴唇咬破了。我还和毛主席他老人家握手合影了。他老人家的手又大又厚实又温暖。握着毛主席的手，我胸中燃烧着征服旧世界的怒火；握着毛主席的手，我胸中翻腾着解放全人类的风雷。握在手上，暖在心里，亮在心里。妈妈，您常说毛主席是我们最伟大的领袖，如今我亲眼见到了他老人家，而且看得那样清楚，那样真，我亲手给他老人家献了红袖章，还和毛主席他老人家握手合影了。妈妈，如今我成了世界上最最幸福的人了。妈妈，您一定也很高兴吧！将来我回家的时候，您可要记住一定要握我的手啊！
    妈妈，好妈妈，爸爸和您在离开北京时，告诉我和哥哥：我们是革命军人的后代，父辈用血肉打下了江山，下一辈应该誓死保住它。要我们紧紧跟着毛主席，不离一步。妈妈，我正按您说的做呢。我热爱毛主席，我用我全部的精力来参加无产阶级文化大革命。虽然我还有很多的个人杂念，我还有很多的缺点，不过我一定按毛主席他老人家说的话去做：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。”
    让毛主席他老人家和我们见面的这一天——八月十八日，成为我生活成长道路上的里程碑吧！亲爱的妈妈，我一定一定读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的最最最最忠实可靠的红色卫兵，像您当年当“红小鬼”一样，为伟大壮丽的共产主义事业奋斗终生，搞一辈子阶级斗争，准备和资产阶级打一辈子面对面的硬仗。
    祝您成为永远革命的“老红卫兵”！
    让我们共同祝福最最敬爱的毛主席万寿无疆！
              红卫兵　杭生
                  八月十八日夜
