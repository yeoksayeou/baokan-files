The Party branch of Jiajiaying Production Brigade has focused on the "small matters" in production and daily life, using them to educate the peasants and instill Mao Zedong Thought bit by bit and persistently into the hearts of the peasants.

People engage in various thoughts and ideological struggles in their daily labor and work. Different thoughts lead to ideological struggles. By seizing these active thoughts, carrying out the struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology, and using Mao Zedong Thought to criticize bourgeois ideology, we can promote the ideological transformation of the masses, thus highlighting politics.

The struggle between the two lines and the two ideologies permeates all aspects. Some things may seem small, but their influence on people is significant. The Party branch should be adept at seizing the ideological trends and linking some "small matters" in life with the overall political direction. In this way, when handling a matter, we will not only consider resolving the contradictions in the specific matter itself but also consider using the handling of this matter to raise people's socialist awareness.

Political and ideological work should focus on major political and ideological movements as well as daily, bit-by-bit work. By combining the two, we can continuously promote the ideological transformation of people.

　　从小处着手
    贾家庄大队党支部，抓住生产和生活中一些“小事”上的活思想，对农民进行教育，把毛泽东思想，点点滴滴地、坚持不断地灌输到农民的心里。
    人们在日常劳动和工作中，时时处处都有这样那样的思想活动。有不同的思想，就有思想斗争。抓住这些活思想，开展兴无灭资的斗争，运用毛泽东思想，批判资产阶级思想，促进群众的思想革命化，这就把政治突出了。
    两条道路、两种思想的斗争贯穿在一切方面，有些事情看起来似乎很小，但是对人们的影响却很大。党支部要善于抓住思想苗头，把生活中的某些“小事”和整个政治方向联系起来。这样，在处理一件事情的时候，就会不仅考虑到解决具体事物本身的矛盾，而且考虑到通过处理这件事情，来提高人们的社会主义觉悟。
    政治思想工作，要抓大的政治思想运动，也要抓日常的、点点滴滴的工作。把两者结合起来，不断促进人的思想革命化。
