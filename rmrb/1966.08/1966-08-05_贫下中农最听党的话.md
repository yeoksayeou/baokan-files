Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Listen to the Party's Words

Li Mingfen
Chairman of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Association, Xiaozhai Brigade, Jincity People's Commune, Jinning County, Yunnan

After watching the film "Two Families," I kept thinking, "This doesn't make sense." I told my son, "We poor and lower-middle peasants would never do such a thing. These filmmakers are slandering us. We must fight them to the end!"

We poor and lower-middle peasants listen to the Party's words the most, because we have suffered the most in the past. It is the Party and Chairman Mao who have saved us from our miserable lives. In 1953, during the unified purchase and supply, the higher authorities set the task, and we thought the task was too small. We wanted to sell more and did not resist the policy. No one underreported. When the call to collect grain came, the small granaries were full. When the call to deliver public and surplus grain came, everyone smiled, took up the flags, and carried the grain away. But the film says that we poor and lower-middle peasants do not want to sell surplus grain to the state, which is completely fabricated. The film portrays us as landlords and rich peasants, almost making us look terrible!

I think this film is not attacking any individual but is attacking our Party. They attack the poor and lower-middle peasants, which means they are attacking our great Party. They are not just criticizing the cooperative system but are trying to restore capitalism. If their plot succeeds, our socialist country will change color.

I think the people who made this film are not our people. They wear the cloak of "revolution" and shoot poisonous arrows at us. They are the running dogs of Khrushchev revisionism and imperialism.

We poor and lower-middle peasants will always follow Chairman Mao. In this great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we poor and lower-middle peasants must arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely fight against those demons and monsters, and uproot "Two Families" and all poisonous weeds.

    贫下中农最听党的话
    云南晋宁县晋城人民公社小寨大队贫下中农协会主任  李明芬
    看了《两家人》以后，我越想越不对头，就对儿子说：我们贫下中农永远不会干那样的事。这些编电影的人在污蔑我们，我们非跟他们斗到底不可！
    我们贫农下中农最听党的话，因为我们过去受苦最深，是党和毛主席把我们从苦日子里救出来的。一九五三年统购统销时，上级定了任务，我们还嫌任务少了，要求多卖，没有谁对政策抵触，没有谁少报的。一声喊收谷子，下面的小仓就满了。一声喊送公粮余粮，大家脸上都笑开了，扛起旗子，挑起谷子就走。但是，电影却说我们贫下中农不愿把余粮卖给国家，这是无中生有。电影把我们写成象地主富农一样，简直把我们丑化得不成样子了！
    我看，这个电影不是攻击哪一个人，而是在攻击我们党。他们攻击贫下中农，就是攻击我们伟大的党。他们还不只是在骂合作化，而是想搞资本主义复辟。如果真让他们的阴谋实现，我们的社会主义国家就要变颜色。
    我看，拍这部电影的不是我们的人。他们披着“革命”的外衣，向我们放毒箭。他们是赫鲁晓夫修正主义和帝国主义的走狗。
    我们贫下中农，永远跟着毛主席走。在这场伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们贫下中农一定要用毛泽东思想武装头脑，狠狠地跟那帮牛鬼蛇神斗，把《两家人》和一切毒草，连根挖掉。
