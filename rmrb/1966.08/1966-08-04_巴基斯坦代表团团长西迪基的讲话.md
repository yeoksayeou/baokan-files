Vice Mayor, Comrades, Chinese Friends:

I once again express my heartfelt and most sincere gratitude to the great Chinese people and their government for providing the opportunity for Asian and African writers to hold an emergency meeting in Beijing. The purpose of this meeting is to firmly support the heroic struggle of Vietnamese patriots against the naked aggression launched by American imperialists and their lackeys. It is well known that this historic meeting has achieved remarkable success. The meeting reaffirmed the growing friendship and unity among the peoples of Asia and Africa. Almost all the fifty-three delegations from various regions of Africa and Asia declared in unison that they firmly and unitedly support the national liberation movement of the heroic Vietnamese people. They mercilessly condemn all the inhuman and barbaric measures taken by American imperialists and their accomplices against the freedom fighters, who bomb peaceful cities and massacre innocent people, committing heinous crimes that are a disgrace to human civilization.

I believe that one of the most important achievements of the emergency meeting is the important decision made regarding the convening of the Third Asian and African Writers' Conference in Beijing next year. The unanimous voice of Asian and African writers has dispelled all the doubts and confusion created in vain by the splitters at the so-called consultative meeting held in Cairo in June this year. The splitters not only attempted to sabotage the unity of the revolutionary movement of Asian and African writers but also shamelessly attempted to undermine the sacred cause of the freedom fighters of Vietnam.

Another important aspect of the emergency meeting that I would like to emphasize is the enthusiastic mood and spirit of cooperation among the representatives of various countries. The entire process and work of the meeting were conducted in a most democratic and brotherly atmosphere. The organizers, especially the Chinese Writers' Association, deserve our sincere praise for their excellent arrangements and unparalleled efficiency, as well as for mobilizing all possible conveniences, making this meeting a historic gathering of writers.

Vice Mayor, I would like to take this opportunity to express on behalf of Pakistani writers, the people of Pakistan and Kashmir, our deepest and most sincere thanks to the Asian and African writers for their unanimous and resolute support for the heroic struggle of the freedom fighters of Kashmir, who have been fighting for nineteen years against the most brutal and tyrannical rule of the Indian occupying forces and their lackeys.

The fact that everyone can look at the Kashmir liberation movement objectively, consider it in its historical and political context without bias, and support it resolutely, just as they support the revolutionary liberation movements in Vietnam, Angola, Congo, and Palestine, is indeed a significant event in the history of the Asian and African writers' movement. I reiterate that the Kashmir issue is not a dispute between two Asian countries, that is, between India and Pakistan. This is a completely wrong idea. It is a political smokescreen and conspiracy by the Indian reactionaries and their imperialist accomplices against the Kashmir patriots who are bravely and unremittingly fighting to overthrow the yoke of Indian slavery. The Kashmir people have a just cause, that is, they should be allowed to decide their future according to the principle of self-determination. As for the principle of self-determination, there is no room for argument. Under no circumstances should this principle be bargained. It is a right that people are born with, and we revolutionary Asian and African writers firmly believe in this principle.

Vice Mayor,

The emergency meeting provided me with an opportunity to see this great country of the Chinese people, which has a civilization of several thousand years, rich culture, and natural resources; it is a country with rich historical relics, enchanting lakes, beautiful gardens, and a country full of poetry and picturesque scenery, where a great socialist revolution is taking place, advancing victoriously towards the era of communism that it yearns for. I am particularly excited to see that the Chinese people, under the guidance of Chairman Mao Zedong, have achieved such astonishing progress in all aspects in just seventeen years, which is unparalleled in human history. A society that was corrupted and humiliated by imperialists and their feudal lords and capitalists for hundreds of years has been transformed according to socialist patterns and principles. In today's China, the exploitation of human labor has been completely eliminated. The smiles and joy on the faces of Chinese men, women, and children reflect progress and prosperity. The Chinese people have now truly become masters of their own destiny. The energetic and talented Chinese people have not only rebuilt the industries destroyed by the Japanese occupying forces and the Kuomintang reactionaries but have also established new heavy industries and large factories, where astonishing technological and scientific experiments are being conducted. They have completely transformed barren lands plagued by famine into bountiful fields and green orchards. They have achieved these great progress and achievements on the basis of self-reliance taught by their great leader Chairman Mao Zedong. The teachings of Chairman Mao Zedong are a beacon for the suffering masses of the world, especially the peoples of Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

I am pleased that Pakistan and China have the closest and friendliest relations. This close friendly connection is based on the common wishes of the two peoples, as our great national leader, President Field Marshal Ayub Khan, said in his speech last month:

"Our friendship with China is not a matter of convenience but is based on mutual cooperation and the desire for peace. The basis of this relationship will remain forever."

President Ayub Khan is a man of his word, and I sincerely believe that he will keep his promise.

Vice Mayor:

The people of Pakistan will never forget the sincere support given by the Chinese people and their government at the most critical moment in our country's history last September when India cowardly invaded Pakistan with all its armed forces. You, the great Chinese people, have proven that you are indeed our friends in adversity. I assure you that the people of Pakistan will resolutely and wholeheartedly stand with you in your struggle against imperialists and their lackeys.

Long live the friendship between Pakistan and China!

Long live the heroic struggle of the freedom fighters of Vietnam!

Long live Asian and African unity!

### 巴基斯坦代表团团长西迪基的讲话

专栏：

    巴基斯坦代表团团长西迪基的讲话副市长先生，同行们，中国朋友们：
    我再一次谨向伟大的中国人民和他们的政府表示衷心的和最真诚的谢意，感谢他们为亚非作家提供了在北京举行紧急会议的机会。这次会议的目的是表示坚决支持越南爱国者为反对美帝国主义者及其走狗所发动的赤裸裸的侵略而正在进行着的英勇斗争。众所周知，这次历史性会议取得了显著的成功。会议重新肯定了亚非各国人民之间日益发展的友谊和团结。几乎是来自非洲和亚洲各个地区的五十三个代表团同声宣布，他们坚定地、团结一致地支持英勇的越南人民的民族解放运动，无情地谴责美帝国主义者及其帮凶对自由战士采取的一切惨无人道的野蛮手段，他们轰炸和平城市，屠杀无辜的人民，犯下了对人类文明说来是一种耻辱的可怕暴行。
    我认为紧急会议的最重要的成果之一就是它作出了关于明年在北京召开第三届亚非作家大会的重要决定。亚非作家的这个一致的呼声澄清了分裂主义者今年六月在开罗召开的所谓协商会议徒劳地制造的一切怀疑和混乱。分裂主义者不仅企图破坏亚非作家革命运动的团结，而且还无耻地企图损害越南的自由战士的神圣事业。
    我想要强调的紧急会议的另一个重要方面就是各国作家代表之间的热烈情绪和合作感。会议的全部进程和工作都是在一种最民主的兄弟般的气氛中进行的。会议的召集者，特别是中国作家协会，由于他们作了很好的安排，而且具有无比的效率，并动员了一切可能的便利条件，使得这次会议成为作家们的一次具有划时代意义的聚会，应该得到我们真诚的赞扬。
    副市长先生，我愿借此机会代表巴基斯坦作家、巴基斯坦和克什米尔人民向亚非作家致以最深切、最真挚的感谢，感谢他们一致而且坚决地支持克什米尔自由战士十九年来为反对印度占领军及其走狗的最残暴、最专横的统治而进行的英勇斗争。
    大家能够实事求是地看待克什米尔的解放运动，按照它的历史和政治背景毫无偏见地考虑克什米尔的解放运动，并且象支持越南、安哥拉、刚果和巴勒斯坦等其他的革命解放运动一样予以坚决的支持，这在亚非作家运动的历史上的确是一件大事。我再一次重申，克什米尔问题并不是亚洲两个国家之间的争端，也就是说，并不是印度和巴基斯坦之间的争端。这完全是一种错误的想法。这是印度反动派和他们的帝国主义同谋者反对为推翻印度奴役的枷锁而英勇不懈地斗争的克什米尔爱国者的一个政治烟幕和阴谋。克什米尔人民有着一个正当的理由，那就是，应该允许他们根据自决权来决定他们的前途。而就自决权的原则而论，对它是没有什么可争论的。在任何情况下都不允许拿这个原则做交易。它是人民与生俱来的权利，我们革命的亚非作家坚决地相信这个原则。
    副市长先生，
    紧急会议给我提供了一个机会来看看这个伟大的中国人民的国家，它有着几千年的文明、丰富的文化和自然资源；它是一个有丰富的历史古迹，迷人的湖泊，优美的花园和充满诗情画意的国家，在那里正在进行着一场伟大的社会主义革命，胜利地朝着她所向往的目标——共产主义时代迈进。我十分兴奋地看到中国人民在毛泽东主席的指引下，在短短的十七年当中在各方面都取得了如此惊人的成就，这是人类历史上无与伦比的。一个被帝国主义者及其仆从封建主和资本家腐蚀和污辱达几百年的社会已经按照社会主义的式样和原则重新改变了面貌。在今天的中国，对人的劳动力的剥削已经完全消灭。从中国的男人、妇女和儿童的微笑的、欢乐的面孔上可以看到进步和繁荣。中国人民现在已经真正成了自己命运的主人。精力充沛的、有才能的中国人民不仅重建起被日本占领军和国民党反动派所破坏的工业，而且还建立了新的重工业和大工厂，在那里进行了惊人的技术和科学实验。他们已经完全把发生饥荒的不毛之地改变成丰收的田地和绿色的果园。他们是在他们的伟大领袖毛泽东主席教导的自力更生的基础上取得这种巨大的进步和成就的。毛泽东主席的学说是全世界受苦的大众，特别是非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲人民的灯塔。
    巴基斯坦和中国有着最亲切和友好的关系，我为此感到高兴。这种紧密的友好联系是建立在两国人民的共同愿望的基础之上的，正如我们伟大的民族领袖陆军元帅阿尤布·汗总统在他上月的讲话中所说的：
    “我们同中国的友谊不是权宜之计，而是建立在相互合作和争取和平的愿望的基础之上的。我们这种关系的基础将永远保持下去。”
    阿尤布总统是说话算数的人，我真诚地相信他将信守他的诺言。
    副市长先生：
    巴基斯坦人民将永远不会忘记中国人民和他们的政府在去年九月印度以它的全部武装力量怯懦地侵犯巴基斯坦的那个我国历史上最关键性的时刻给予我们的真诚的支持。你们伟大的中国人民证实了你们确实是我们的患难朋友。我向你们保证巴基斯坦人民在你们反对帝国主义者及其走狗的斗争中坚决地、全心全意地同你们在一起。
    巴基斯坦和中国的友谊万岁！
    越南的自由战士的英勇斗争万岁！
    亚非团结万岁！
