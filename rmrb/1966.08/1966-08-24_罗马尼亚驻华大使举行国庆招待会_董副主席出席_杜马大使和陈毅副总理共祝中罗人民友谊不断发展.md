Romanian Ambassador to China, Aurel Dumă, hosted a reception tonight to celebrate the National Day of the Socialist Republic of Romania.

Vice Chairman Dong Biwu, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, along with Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Yang Mingxuan and Liu Ningyi, and Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Gao Chongmin, were invited to attend the reception.

Ambassador Aurel Dumă and Vice Premier Chen Yi both spoke at the reception, expressing their wishes for the continuous development of friendship between the peoples of China and Romania.

In his speech, Ambassador Aurel Dumă introduced Romania's achievements in socialist construction and discussed Romania's foreign policy. He stated that Romania's international relations are based on the unshakable principles of independence and sovereignty, equality of rights, non-interference in internal affairs, and mutual benefit. Romania supports the peoples of all countries in their struggle for and defense of national independence and freedom.

The ambassador said that the Romanian people and government resolutely condemn American imperialism's aggression against Vietnam and fully support the four-point proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. He said that the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is the sole legitimate representative of the people of South Vietnam. Romania demands that the United States immediately and unconditionally stop bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, cease its aggressive war against Vietnam, withdraw all American and other interventionist troops from South Vietnam, and dismantle all American military bases in South Vietnam. We are confident that the cause of independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of the Vietnamese people will surely triumph.

The ambassador spoke about the fraternal cooperation between the two countries, the two parties, and the two peoples of Romania and China. He said that the Romanian people are genuinely pleased with the remarkable achievements of the Chinese people in socialist construction under the leadership of the tried-and-true Communist Party of China.

Vice Premier Chen Yi, in his speech, pointed out that under the leadership of the Romanian Communist Party, the Romanian people, through tenacious struggle and hard work, have achieved significant successes in socialist transformation and socialist construction. He said that this is the result of the Romanian people's adherence to the principle of independent and self-reliant construction.

In discussing the Vietnam issue, Vice Premier Chen Yi strongly condemned American imperialism for escalating the war in Vietnam while engaging in various "peace talks" conspiracies to save its doomed fate. He condemned the accomplices of American imperialism for actively collaborating with American imperialism's "peace talks." He said that socialist countries and revolutionary peoples around the world should resolutely condemn American imperialism's crimes of expanding the war in Vietnam, resolutely expose any "peace talks" conspiracies of American imperialism and its accomplices, and resolutely support the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war.

He said that the Chinese people most fervently and resolutely support Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to All Compatriots." No matter what tricks American imperialism plays, no matter what risks we have to bear and what sacrifices we have to make, we will fully support the Vietnamese people until they achieve final victory in their anti-American national salvation war.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the peoples of China and Romania have established deep friendship through long-term revolutionary struggles. We believe that in future joint struggles, the friendship and cooperation between the peoples of China and Romania will be further consolidated and developed.

Invited to attend the reception were also Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Qiao Guanhua, leaders from various departments of the government, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and people from various circles in the capital.

Ambassadors from various countries to China also attended the reception.
