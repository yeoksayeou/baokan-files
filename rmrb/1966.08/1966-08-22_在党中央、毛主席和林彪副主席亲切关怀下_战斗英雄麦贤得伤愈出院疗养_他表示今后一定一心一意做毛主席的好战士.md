Under the caring attention of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and Vice Chairman Lin Biao, combat hero Mai Xiande of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy, who has recovered from his injuries, left the hospital for convalescence on August 20. He expressed his determination to wholeheartedly serve as a good soldier of Chairman Mao.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 21: Under the caring attention of the Party and Chairman Mao, after the medical staff's full efforts, combat hero Mai Xiande of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy, who was injured in the "August 6" naval battle last year, has recovered and left the hospital on August 20 to convalesce at a certain naval convalescent hospital.

Mai Xiande was injured in the "August 6" naval battle last year. He was sent to the General Hospital of the Guangzhou Military Region on August 15 of last year, and it has been exactly one year and five days since then. During this period, the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and Vice Chairman Lin Biao have shown great concern for Mai Xiande. Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin Biao specially sent Comrades He Long and Ye Jianying to visit him in the hospital. Other leaders also frequently visited the hospital to comfort him. Party and state leaders repeatedly instructed the medical staff to definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize politics, and do everything possible to cure Mai Xiande's injuries and help him quickly recover his health.

During the treatment process for Mai Xiande, the medical staff of the General Hospital of the Guangzhou Military Region always acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions, highly carrying forward the spirit of extreme responsibility for work and extreme enthusiasm for comrades and the people in the revolutionary cause. They worked day and night to provide effective treatment and meticulous care for Mai Xiande, ensuring his safety. On May 18, with the assistance of an external neurosurgeon, the last piece of shrapnel in Mai Xiande's skull was successfully removed. Now, Mai Xiande's health has recovered well, his running speed is almost back to normal, his comprehension and memory have significantly improved, and he can speak more and more words every day.

During the recovery process, Mai Xiande insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works and reading newspapers every day. The crimes of American imperialism in expanding the war in Vietnam aroused his extreme indignation, and he repeatedly requested to leave the hospital and return to the front line. After reading the statement of the Chinese government on supporting Vietnam's anti-American national salvation struggle, he could not help but enthusiastically shout, "I want to return to the ship, I want to support Vietnam and resist America!" He also actively participated in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, enthusiastically cheering, "Firmly support the decision of the Party Central Committee, and eliminate all enemies!"

On the morning of August 20, the moment Mai Xiande had been looking forward to leaving the hospital arrived. After getting up, he put on a brand new uniform with a joyful and excited heart, neatly arranged his most beloved "Quotations from Chairman Mao," Mao's portrait, the Constitution of the Communist Party of China, and "The Song of Ou Yanghai," and with his right hand, he wrote neatly on a blackboard in his ward, "Thank you for the care of the doctors and nurses." He then went to the physiotherapy department, neurosurgery department, and other departments, as well as the kitchen, to salute and shake hands with the doctors, nurses, and staff, thanking them for their care. The General Hospital of the Guangzhou Military Region held a farewell ceremony for Mai Xiande's recovery and discharge from the hospital. The hospital leader, representing all the staff, said in his speech that Mai Xiande's health recovery was so fast and good, first of all, it should be attributed to our great Party, to our greatest leader Chairman Mao, and to the support of the people across the country. This is a victory of Mao Zedong Thought. He said, "Comrade Mai Xiande's heroic deeds and his exemplary actions of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works during his hospitalization, as well as his willpower in fighting against the disease, are our learning examples." Mai Xiande spoke in the midst of warm applause. He said, "Thank you to the Party, Chairman Mao, and the people of the whole country for their care. After I leave the hospital, I will definitely study Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, wholeheartedly serving as a good soldier of Chairman Mao." He raised his arm and shouted, "Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

At the farewell ceremony, the hospital leader, on behalf of the hospital, presented a copy of "Selected Readings from Mao Zedong's Works" and a hero's gold pen to Mai Xiande as a keepsake. Mai Xiande donated a half-bust statue of Chairman Mao to the General Hospital.

When Mai Xiande arrived at a certain naval convalescent hospital, he was welcomed by the leaders of the South China Fleet and hundreds of staff and workers of the convalescent hospital. At the welcoming ceremony, the leader of the South China Fleet said, "Comrade Mai Xiande's recovery and discharge from the hospital is a victory of Mao Zedong Thought. All the comrades in our convalescent hospital should, like the comrades in the general hospital, care for Comrade Mai Xiande, so that he can quickly recover his health and return to the battlefield."

After entering the convalescent room, Mai Xiande first took out Chairman Mao's portrait and respectfully hung it on the central wall, fully expressing his boundless love for the great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao.

    在党中央、毛主席和林彪副主席亲切关怀下
    战斗英雄麦贤得伤愈出院疗养
    他表示今后一定一心一意做毛主席的好战士
    据新华社广州二十一日电　在党和毛主席的亲切关怀下，中国人民解放军海军战斗英雄麦贤得经过医务人员全力治疗，已在本月二十日伤愈出院，转往海军某疗养院疗养。
    麦贤得是在去年“八·六”海战中英勇负伤的。他在去年八月十五日被送进广州部队总医院，到现在已整整一年零五天。这期间，党中央、毛主席和林彪副主席给予麦贤得极大的关怀。毛主席和林彪副主席特地派贺龙、叶剑英同志到医院看望他。其他负责人，也不断到医院对他进行慰问。党和国家领导人还一再指示医务人员，一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，千方百计治好麦贤得的伤，帮助麦贤得迅速恢复健康。
    在为麦贤得治疗的过程中，广州部队总医院医务人员，时时刻刻按照毛主席的指示办事，高度发扬了对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民极端的热忱的革命精神，夜以继日地对麦贤得进行了有效的治疗和周到细致的护理，保证了麦贤得的生命安全。五月十八日，在院外脑外科医生协助下，又为麦贤得顺利地取出了存留在颅内的最后一块弹片。现在麦贤得的身体健康恢复得很好，跑步速度接近正常水平，理解力和记忆力有明显进步，能说的话也一天天多起来了。
    在恢复健康的过程中，麦贤得每天坚持学习毛主席著作和读报。美帝国主义在越南扩大侵略战争的罪行，激起了他胸中的无比愤怒，曾连续四次要求出院重返前线。当他读到我国政府关于支援越南抗美救国斗争的声明之后，禁不住激昂地高呼：“我要回舰，我要援越抗美！”他还积极参加无产阶级文化大革命，热烈欢呼“坚决拥护党中央的决定，消灭一切敌人！”
    二十日清晨，麦贤得盼望出院的时刻到了。他起床后，怀着激动喜悦的心情，穿上崭新的军装，把自己最心爱的《毛主席语录》、毛主席像、中国共产党党章和《欧阳海之歌》整理好，用右手在他病房里一块黑板上，端端正正写下：“感谢医生护士的关怀”九个大字，又到理疗科、脑外科等科室和厨房，向医生护士及工作人员一一敬礼，握手告别，感谢他们对他的关怀。广州部队总医院为麦贤得伤愈出院举行了欢送会。医院负责人代表全体工休人员在讲话中指出，麦贤得同志健康恢复得这样快，这样好，首先应该归功于我们伟大的党，归功于我们最伟大的领袖毛主席，归功于全国人民的支援。这是毛泽东思想的胜利。他说：“麦贤得同志的英雄事迹和他在住院期间活学活用毛主席著作的模范行动，以及他向疾病作斗争的毅力，是我们学习的榜样。”麦贤得在热烈的掌声中讲话。他说：“感谢党和毛主席和全国人民对我的关怀。我出院后，一定要好好读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，一心一意做毛主席的好战士。”他振臂高呼：“中国共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    在欢送会上，总医院负责人代表医院，把一本《毛泽东著作选读》和一支英雄金笔，送给麦贤得留念。麦贤得把一座毛主席的半身塑像，赠送给总医院。
    麦贤得来到海军某疗养院时，受到南海舰队负责人和疗养院数百名工休人员的夹道欢迎。在欢迎会上，南海舰队负责人说：“麦贤得同志伤愈出院，是毛泽东思想的胜利。我们疗养院的全体同志，要像总医院同志那样关心麦贤得同志，让麦贤得同志早日把身体养得更壮实，重返战斗岗位。”
    麦贤得进入疗养室后，首先拿出毛主席像，恭恭敬敬地贴在正中墙上，充分表达了他对伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席无限热爱的感情。
