On June 29, the Liberation Army of South Vietnam fought a brilliant battle of annihilation at Erqiao on Highway One.

Erqiao is located on Highway One, 28 kilometers northwest of Hue, the capital of Thua Thien Province.

On that day, as dawn broke, the winding, serpentine Highway One gradually came into view before the eyes of the Liberation Army's reconnaissance troops. All around was quiet, not a sound to be heard. The soldiers were waiting for the enemy to arrive.

At 6 a.m., the sound of aircraft engines could be heard in the distance. Soon, the enemy's reconnaissance planes appeared above the highway, circling repeatedly and straining to search for targets on the ground. They dropped smoke bombs indiscriminately at suspected Liberation Army positions, and then fighter planes came to bomb and strafe, clearing the way for the ground troops. However, the stupid enemy planes could never find the cleverly concealed Liberation Army positions. Instead, every tiny movement of the enemy was sharply observed by the brave and intelligent Liberation Army reconnaissance troops.

At 7 a.m., the reconnaissance troops spotted two enemy platoons sneaking forward from both sides of the highway like thieves. Behind them was an enemy regiment's convoy of 30 military vehicles, packed with puppet soldiers and American "advisors."

At 7:20 a.m., the entire enemy convoy had completely fallen into the ambush set by the Liberation Army at Erqiao.

"Boom!" A loud explosion echoed as the lead enemy vehicle caught fire and billowed thick smoke. The second enemy vehicle slammed on the brakes and wildly sprayed bullets into the surrounding forest. The third and fourth vehicles also caught fire and were immobilized on the road. The following vehicles crowded together in panic. The startled enemy soldiers, caught off guard, scrambled to jump off the vehicles to save themselves. But they were helpless, unable to escape the severe punishment. The Liberation Army unleashed a dense network of firepower from various types of guns and cannons, raining down on the enemy. Many enemy soldiers were shot dead before they could jump off the vehicles, falling onto the vehicle steps, while the wounded enemy soldiers howled in pain and disarray. The Liberation Army gave the enemy no chance to catch their breath, charging down like tigers from the mountains, using bayonets and rifle butts to engage in close combat. The Liberation Army soldiers also seized the opportunity to rush through the smoke-filled battlefield, jump onto the enemy vehicles, and destroy them one by one with hand grenades and bombs. Some enemy soldiers attempted to drive away, but were immediately destroyed by the Liberation Army soldiers with rocket launchers.

The brave Liberation Army soldiers continued their fierce assault, cutting the enemy into smaller groups for annihilation. The once arrogant American puppet soldiers were now lying dead everywhere, with casualties piling up. An American "advisor" was so frightened that he hid under a vehicle, revealing the true face of a "paper tiger."

After 20 minutes of battle, the Liberation Army had completely controlled the battlefield, annihilating an entire camp of the puppet marine corps, killing 416 enemy soldiers, including two American "advisors," one puppet colonel, one lieutenant colonel, and three majors, and capturing 30 alive; destroying 25 various military vehicles, and seizing 50 weapons, including eight mortars.

After annihilating this enemy force, the Liberation Army safely returned to their base. When the enemy reinforcements arrived at the scene, all they saw were the scattered bodies of American puppet soldiers and the overturned wreckage of vehicles.

### 一号公路上的一场歼灭战

    一号公路上的一场歼灭战
    六月二十九日越南南方解放军在儿桥又打了一场漂亮的歼灭战。
    儿桥位于第一号公路上，距承天省顺化市西北二十八公里。
    这一天，天刚破晓，象长蛇一样迂回、曲折的一号公路渐渐清晰地显露在解放军侦察员的眼前。四周静悄悄的，鸦雀无声。战士们在等待敌人到来。
    六时，飞机的马达声远远传来。接着，敌人的侦察机在公路上空出现，反复盘旋，费力地搜索地面上的目标。它向一些疑是解放军阵地的地区胡乱投扔了烟幕弹，接着战斗机就前来轰炸、扫射，为地面部队扫清道路。但是，愚蠢的敌机始终无法发现隐蔽得极为巧妙的解放军阵地，反过来，敌人的每一个细微的动作，都不能逃脱勇敢、机智的解放军侦察员的锐利的眼睛。
    七时正，侦察员发现远处有两个排敌军，象小偷似的从公路两旁摸索前进。在它们的后面，是敌人一个团的车队，共三十辆军车，上面挤满了伪军和美国“顾问”。
    七时二十分，敌人整个车团完全落入解放军在儿桥地区布下的伏击圈。
      “轰隆！”一声巨响，最前头的一辆敌车起火，升起滚滚浓烟。第二辆敌车慌忙刹车，并向周围的树林疯狂扫射。跟在后面的第三、第四辆也中弹报销了，死死地躺在路上。后面的车辆慌忙地挤在一起。遭到突然袭击的敌军吓破了胆，他们顾不得死活，争着从车上跳下来逃命。但他们插翅难飞，再也逃脱不了严厉的惩罚。解放军以各种不同口径的枪弹炮火，交织成一个密集的火力网，从敌人头上压下来。许多敌军来不及跳下车就被打死了，扑倒在车子的踏板上，被打伤的敌人鬼哭狼嚎，狼狈万状。解放军不让敌人有喘息的机会，象猛虎下山似地冲向敌人，用刺刀、枪托同敌军展开肉搏战。解放军战士还抓紧时机，冲过硝烟弥漫的阵地，跳上敌车，用手榴弹、手雷把它们逐个炸毁。一些敌人妄图开车溜走，但立刻被解放军战士用火箭筒击毁。
    神勇的解放军战士继续猛冲猛杀，把敌人切成许多小股来加以消灭。原来耀武扬威的美伪军被解放军杀得横尸遍野，死伤枕藉，一个美国“顾问”吓得魂不附体，把头钻进车底下，露出一副“纸老虎”的丑态。
    解放军经过二十分钟的战斗，完全控制了阵地，全歼伪海军陆战队一个营，共打死敌人四百十六名，其中有两名美国“顾问”、一名伪军上校、一名中校和三名少校，活捉三十名；炸毁各种军车二十五辆，缴获武器五十件，其中有迫击炮八门。
    当消灭了这股敌人之后，解放军安全地返回基地。而在敌人的援军赶到现场时，他们眼前只是一片横七竖八的美伪军尸体和东歪西倒的汽车残骸。
