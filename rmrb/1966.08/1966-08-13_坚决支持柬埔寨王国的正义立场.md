Firmly Support the Just Stance of the Kingdom of Cambodia

The Cambodian Head of State, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, pointed out on August 11 that the so-called Asian countries conference proposed by Thailand, "Malaysia," and the Philippines is an idea "thought up by the United States," a "ridiculous and laughable farce," and Cambodia absolutely refuses to participate. Prince Sihanouk's remarks hit the nail on the head, touching the essence of the matter. The Chinese people admire Prince Sihanouk's firm stance and sharp insight. The Chinese government firmly supports the just stance of the Cambodian government. Some Westerners even discuss the possibility of China participating in this conference, which is truly a daydream.

Recently, Thailand, "Malaysia," and the Philippines, especially the Bangkok authorities, have put on a show, proposing that some Asian countries hold a meeting to discuss the "peaceful resolution" of the Vietnamese problem. This farce, with the Thai reactionaries playing the leading role, is particularly "ridiculous and laughable." The Thai authorities are the faithful accomplices of the United States in expanding the war in Vietnam. Thai territory has long been an important base for the U.S. aggression in Vietnam. In a word, the hands of the Thai reactionaries are also stained with the blood of the Vietnamese people. Now, the accomplices want to step forward and act as "mediators," which is enough to make people laugh.

Thai Foreign Minister Thanom Kittikachorn eagerly declares that this action is not "instructed by the United States." This is like saying "there are no three hundred taels of silver here." Everyone knows that the Thai authorities cannot act independently. When the United States says to stand, the Thai reactionaries dare not sit down. Without the United States' instructions, the Thai authorities cannot do anything in international affairs.

Prince Sihanouk's remarks have opened the eyes of many people. All Asian countries with a sense of justice and self-respect will certainly not fall for the U.S. "peace talks" conspiracy and will not go along with the Thai reactionaries' tricks.

　　坚决支持柬埔寨王国的正义立场
　　本报评论员
    柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王在八月十一日指出，由泰国、“马来西亚”和菲律宾联合提出的所谓亚洲国家会议，是美国“想出来的”，是一出“滑稽和可笑的喜剧”，柬埔寨绝对拒绝参加。西哈努克亲王的谈话，一针见血，触到了事物的本质。中国人民钦佩西哈努克亲王坚定的立场和锐利的目光。中国政府坚决支持柬埔寨王国政府的正义立场。有些西方人士竟然议论着什么中国可能参加这个会议的问题，这真是白日做梦。
    最近，泰国、“马来西亚”和菲律宾，特别是曼谷当局，装模作样，提议由一些亚洲国家开会，讨论越南问题的“和平解决”。这出丑剧，由泰国反动派上台串演主角，特别显得“滑稽和可笑”。泰国当局，就是美国扩大侵越战火的忠实帮凶。泰国领土，早已成为美国侵略越南战争的重要基地。一句话，泰国反动派的双手也沾满了越南人民的鲜血。现在，帮凶竟然想出面充当“和事佬”，岂不笑掉人们的牙齿？
    泰国外交部长科曼竭力表白这一行动不是美国“授意搞的”。这叫做“此地无银三百两”。谁都知道，泰国当局并不能当家作主。美国说站着，泰国反动派就不敢坐下。没有美国的示意，泰国当局是不能在国际事务方面有什么作为的。
    西哈努克亲王的谈话，擦亮了许多人的眼睛。一切有正义感和自尊心的亚洲国家，一定不会上美国“和谈”阴谋的当，不会附和泰国反动派的诡计。
