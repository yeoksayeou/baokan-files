The principles of Marxism are numerous and varied, but ultimately, they can be summed up in one sentence: "Rebellion is justified." For thousands of years, it has always been said that oppression is justified, exploitation is justified, and rebellion is unjustified. Since the advent of Marxism, this old case has been overturned. This is a great achievement. This principle is derived from the struggles of the proletariat, and Marx drew the conclusion. Based on this principle, we then resist, struggle, and build socialism.

    毛主席语录
    马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：“造反有理。”几千年来总是说：压迫有理，剥削有理，造反无理。自从马克思主义出来，就把这个旧案翻过来了。这是一个大功劳。这个道理是无产阶级从斗争中得来的，而马克思作了结论。根据这个道理，于是就反抗，就斗争，就干社会主义。
