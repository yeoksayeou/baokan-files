We read Chairman Mao’s books, listen to Chairman Mao’s words, and persist in participating in class struggle and collective production labor. Women have become especially strong, especially brave, and especially intelligent.

Chairman Mao instructs us that those engaged in agriculture should also engage in some industry when conditions permit. We Daqing family members all have this requirement. Now we have established an oil well perforation shell factory in Chuangye Village, and some family members are already manufacturing perforation shells there. We have also established a half-work, half-study middle school. The militia has also been organized. We must learn everything: farming, working, fighting, studying culture, and criticizing the bourgeoisie.

We Daqing workers and family members have taken the path of urban-rural integration and industrial-agricultural integration in mining area construction, which is the revolutionary path guided by Chairman Mao. Every step we take is a challenge to the old world, a criticism of the old world, and a contribution to the construction of a new society.

In recent years, our struggle against old ideas and old habits has been very sharp. When we, carrying Chairman Mao’s books, hoisting shovels, and carrying children, broke through countless difficulties to go to the wilderness to open up land, some people said, “You won’t last three days before you run back!”

No matter what ridicule or difficulties we encounter, the sisters always insist on opening up land during the day and gather in the huts at night, lighting coal oil lamps, studying Chairman Mao’s works together, and doing as Chairman Mao says. The more we study, the stronger our revolutionary spirit becomes. We firmly believe that the path Chairman Mao points out for us must be the right one!

We Daqing workers’ family members have thus resolutely taken the revolutionary path guided by Chairman Mao. In just a few short years, countless women who were oppressed for thousands of years by the old society have become especially strong, especially brave, and especially intelligent in the great waves of class struggle and labor. Plowing, sowing, driving tractors, building houses—we are not inferior to our male comrades.

In the past, we family members were constrained to have only a small world in our hearts, thinking only of our husbands and children all day. Now, we family members read Chairman Mao’s books, think of the collective, love labor, and do revolution. This is a heaven-and-earth change. In the past, some workers said: “The wind blows east when going to work and west when coming back.” Now that the family members have been revolutionized, the wind blows east both when going to work and when coming back. The bourgeoisie and revisionism want to undermine our socialist foundation from this aspect, but they can no longer succeed.

More than 95% of the Daqing oil field workers’ family members who have the ability to work have participated in collective production labor. Last year alone, we produced more than 40 million jin of grain, more than 30 million jin of vegetables, and a large amount of meat, eggs, and other sideline products.

We will resolutely follow Chairman Mao’s instructions and move forward, all the way to communism.

### 石油工业部五好标兵、大庆家属　薛桂芳：我们每走一步都在批判旧世界

    石油工业部五好标兵、大庆家属　薛桂芳：
    我们每走一步都在批判旧世界
    读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，坚持参加阶级斗争和集体生产劳动，妇女们变得格外坚强，格外勇敢，格外聪明
    毛主席指示我们，搞农业的，有条件的时候，也要搞点工业。我们大庆家属都有这样的要求。现在我们创业庄办起了一个油井射孔炮弹制造厂，一部分家属已经在那里造射孔炮弹。我们还办起了半工半读中学。民兵也组织起来了。种地、做工、打仗、学文化、批判资产阶级，样样我们都要学会。
    我们大庆职工和家属在矿区建设上走的城乡结合，工农结合的路，是毛主席指引革命路。我们每走一步，都在向旧世界挑战，都在批判旧世界，都在为建设新社会添砖添瓦。
    这几年，我们同旧思想、旧习惯势力的斗争，一直很尖锐。当我们带着毛主席的书，扛着铁锹，背着娃娃，冲破重重困难，到荒原去开荒的时候，就有人说：“你们用不了三天，就得跑回来！”
    不管遇到什么冷嘲热讽，不管碰到什么困难，姐妹们总是白天坚持开荒，晚上在窝棚里，点起煤油灯，围在一起，一遍一遍地学习毛主席著作，看看毛主席怎么说的，我们就怎么做。越学，闹革命的劲头越大。我们坚决相信毛主席给我们指的这条路一定能走通！
    我们大庆职工家属，就是这样坚决走上了毛主席给我们指引的革命化大道，许许多多被几千年旧社会压得抬不起头的妇女，在短短几年里，在阶级斗争的大风大浪里，在劳动中，变得格外坚强，格外勇敢，格外聪明了。扶犁、点种、开拖拉机，盖房子，干的不比男同志差。
    过去，我们家属被束缚得心里只有那么一点小天地，整天想到的只是丈夫和孩子。现在，我们家属读的是毛主席的书，想的是集体，爱的是劳动，干的是革命，这真是翻天覆地的变化。过去有的职工讲：上班刮东风，下班刮西风。现在家属革命化，上班、下班都刮东风了。资产阶级、修正主义想从这方面挖我们社会主义墙脚，再也办不到了。
    我们大庆油田有劳动能力的职工家属，已经有百分之九十五以上都参加了集体生产劳动。去年一年就打了四千多万斤粮，收了三千多万斤蔬菜，还生产了大量肉、蛋等副食品。
    我们要最坚决地按照毛主席的指示往前走，一直走到共产主义。
