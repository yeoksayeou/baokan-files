We will never forget the most blessed moment of 7:30 PM on the evening of August 10th. At this moment, we met our most beloved and great leader, Chairman Mao.

On that evening after dinner, all the revolutionary comrades of our Political Department, carrying a large portrait of Chairman Mao, arrived at the West Gate of Zhongnanhai. Amidst the cheers of the crowd, our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, came with vigorous steps, smiling and waving to the crowd. At this moment, we had so much to say to him, but we couldn't say a word, we only knew how to shout "Long live Chairman Mao!" When Chairman Mao walked among the crowd and shook hands with us, we were even more excited, tears welling up in our eyes. We, who were once looked down upon by the rich in the old society, never even dreamed that today we could shake hands with the great leader, Chairman Mao.

On the way back, everyone eagerly shared this good news with everyone we met. Comrade Chen Hui seemed like a little child, telling everyone on the way, "I saw Chairman Mao! I saw Chairman Mao!"

Back at home, our hearts were still unsettled. We found three large brushes, tied them together, and wrote eight big characters: "We Met Chairman Mao." As soon as we posted this big-character poster, a crowd immediately gathered, asking us how Chairman Mao was. We said: Chairman Mao was radiant and in good health! Everyone immediately jumped with excitement.

Late at night, some of us were still writing in our diaries, recording the unforgettable moment of 7:30 PM on August 10th; some were still writing letters to distant relatives, reporting this happy news...

Comrade Liu Junting shook hands with Chairman Mao twice. After returning, he couldn't sleep all night, as if Chairman Mao was still in front of him. The next morning, people from the same dormitory came to shake the hand that Chairman Mao had shaken.

　　我们见到了毛主席
　　北京汽车分公司政治部全体革命同志
    我们永远忘不了八月十日晚上七点半这个最幸福的时刻，在这个时刻，我们见到了我们最敬爱最伟大的领袖毛主席。
    这天晚饭后，我们政治部全体革命同志，举着毛主席的巨幅画像，来到了中南海西门，在群众的一片欢呼声中，我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席迈着矫健的步伐来了，他微笑着不断地向群众招手。这时候，我们有多少话想向他老人家说呵！但是，我们什么话都说不出来，只知道不断地高喊“毛主席万岁！”当毛主席走到群众中来和我们握手的时候，我们更是激动得热泪盈眶，我们这些在旧社会被有钱人瞧不起的穷孩子，连做梦也没有想到过，今天，我们能和伟大的领袖毛主席握手。
    回来的路上，大家把这个好消息沿途奔走相告，陈慧同志好象成了一个小孩子，在路上逢人就说：“我见到了毛主席！我见到了毛主席！”
    回到家里，大家的心还不能平静，我们找来了三支很大的笔，绑在一起，写下了八个大字：“我们见到了毛主席”。当我们刚把这张大字报贴出去，人群立刻围了上来，他们纷纷问我们毛主席身体怎么样？我们说：毛主席满面红光，身体非常健康！大家立刻兴奋得跳起来。
    深夜，我们之中有人还在写日记，记下八月十日下午七时半这个终身难忘的时刻；有人还在给远方的亲人写信，报告这个幸福的消息……。
    刘君廷同志两次和毛主席握过手，回来后，他一整夜没有睡着，好象毛主席还在他的面前。第二天早上，同宿舍的人还纷纷跑来握他那只毛主席握过的手。
