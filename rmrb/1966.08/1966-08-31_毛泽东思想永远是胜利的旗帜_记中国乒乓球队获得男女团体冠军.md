On the evening of the 30th, more than 15,000 spectators, both domestic and foreign, at the Beijing Workers' Gymnasium were immersed in joy. Our table tennis athletes once again brought honor to the motherland by winning both the men's and women's team championships at the Beijing International Table Tennis Invitational. When our table tennis athletes ascended the podium and raised the glowing red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," thunderous applause surged wave after wave. The audience sang in unison, "The Great Helmsman Steers the Ship." People enthusiastically shouted: Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand years!

At 7:30 PM, the men's and women's team finals between China and Japan, both at the world's highest level, began. The women's team final was the first to start. China's team featured Lin Huiqing and Zheng Minzhi, two renowned horizontal grip chopping players. Japan's team featured direct grip players, world champion Fukutsu Naoko, and renowned player Yamazaki Kyoko. During the 28th World Table Tennis Championships last year, these two Chinese women's team players defeated the Japanese women's team, composed of Fukutsu Naoko and Sekine Masako, with a 3-0 advantage, thereby winning the women's team world championship for the first time. Today, the Japanese players' attacking power was stronger than a year ago. The Chinese players' chopping technique was also more refined. Over the past year, our athletes, through studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, have undergone significant changes in their spiritual outlook and have a more vigorous fighting spirit. Therefore, from the start of the women's team final, a tense and exciting scene unfolded. In the first match between Zheng Minzhi and Yamazaki Kyoko, the attack and defense were fiercely contested. In the first game, Zheng Minzhi, despite trailing 17-20, remained calm and returned each ball sent by Yamazaki, eventually tying the score at 20-20. After that, both sides treated each ball seriously, resulting in a score of 20-20, 21-21, 22-22, and even 26-26. Finally, due to Zheng Minzhi's attacking error, she lost the first game 26-28. However, in the second and third games, Zheng Minzhi strengthened her defense, bravely and tenaciously returning every ball, whether it was a powerful smash or a short ball near the table, almost becoming an impenetrable wall. Simultaneously, during defense, she would suddenly counterattack when given the chance, often putting Yamazaki in a passive position. In the end, Zheng Minzhi won the next two games 21-16 and 21-14, turning defeat into victory.

Except for losing one doubles match, Zheng Minzhi and Lin Huiqing both defeated the world women's singles champion Fukutsu Naoko with a 2-0 advantage. The Chinese men's team fully demonstrated the fast, fierce, accurate, and versatile style of Chinese table tennis athletes, defeating the Japanese team with an outstanding record of 5-0, achieving their resolve to display new victories of Mao Zedong Thought in the competition.

Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our table tennis athletes have vowed to achieve new victories in the Beijing International Table Tennis Invitational. To prepare for the decisive battle with the Japanese team, during training and the most intense moments of the competition, the athletes persistently studied Chairman Mao's works. They regarded Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle for all their actions. Following Chairman Mao's teachings, they solved ideological issues and overcame technical and physical weaknesses. They shared a common desire: to make the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought shine even more brilliantly in the competition.

The workers, peasants, and soldiers of our country fully understood the significance of this competition. In their enthusiastic letters, passionate phone calls, and warm handshakes, they repeatedly encouraged the table tennis team members to play with style, skill, and the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people guided by Chairman Mao's teachings. During tonight's competition, some spectators presented the athletes with a colorful portrait of our beloved Chairman Mao, with the two eye-catching inscriptions: "Wish you to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and march forward bravely!" The athletes fully understood that the entire nation was participating in this competition with them, and the nation, like them, wanted to demonstrate the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought through this competition. Therefore, world champion Zhuang Zedong repeatedly declared: "I will not disappoint the expectations of the motherland's people!"

Determination and aspirations becoming reality is not an easy task. The Japanese team fielded their strongest lineup, with world women's singles champion Fukutsu Naoko and Japanese men's singles champion Hasegawa Nobuyuki, among other renowned players, all taking the court. Although our athletes, Zhuang Zedong, Li Fuyong (originally Li Fuhong), Zhou Lanxun, Lin Huiqing, and Zheng Minzhi, are all table tennis stars, they still faced many difficulties. Lin Huiqing and Zheng Minzhi had both lost to Fukutsu in the 28th World Table Tennis Championships. Could they win this time? Zhuang Zedong had been suffering from a cold just a few days ago, and Li Fuyong was still not feeling well when he took the court today. Could they perform well? The athletes understood that they must give a definite answer and could not have any other choice. Therefore, before taking the court, they held "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in both hands and swore again: "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, to strive for victory."

Just as the audience has seen, our table tennis athletes fully realized their oaths in tonight's competition. They played with style and skill; they said what they did and did what they said. They are truly the good children of the motherland nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought.

After the competition, the Chinese women's team coach Rong Guantan said: The Chinese table tennis team has once again defeated the world's strong Japanese table tennis team. This is because we firmly believe that arming ourselves with the great Mao Zedong Thought can turn into a great material force and be invincible. Therefore, before the competition, we seriously studied Chairman Mao's works, resolutely followed Chairman Mao's words, and acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We actively studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought to solve various ideological issues among the athletes before the competition, fully concentrating on the competition to strive for victory. Tonight, before the Chinese athletes entered the court, they all carefully read Chairman Mao's quotations: "This army has an indomitable spirit. It will trample all enemies and never be subdued by them. No matter how difficult and dangerous the situation, as long as there is one person, that person must continue to fight."

When Zheng Minzhi faced Yamazaki Kyoko, she initially lost the first game. But when she saw the eight characters she wrote on her wrist based on Chairman Mao's teachings, "Overcome all difficulties, eliminate distractions," she became fearless and daring to attack, not hesitating at critical moments, ultimately winning the next two games and turning defeat into victory.

Li Fuyong was not feeling well today, but after studying Chairman Mao's quotations, "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, to strive for victory," he completely forgot about himself and only thought about playing with the revolutionary style of Chinese athletes. This afternoon, after defeating two excellent Korean players, he took the court again as a key player tonight, with a tenacious revolutionary will, defeating two strong Japanese players, Fukushima Manji and Aikawa Yuji, winning two points for the Chinese team.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres who came to watch the competition were particularly excited tonight. Our athletes' continuous victories repeatedly aroused their boundless love and faith in the great Mao Zedong Thought. A worker from the Daqing Oil Field excitedly said, "Great! Great! They played with the style of the Chinese people. We must bring the revolutionary spirit of the table tennis team to industrial construction." A commune member from the suburbs of Beijing said, "We commune members were greatly inspired by watching the playing style of the Chinese table tennis team. The players all carried the bright red 'Quotations from Chairman Mao.' They used Mao Zedong Thought to guide their playing. We commune members must learn from the table tennis team, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, use Mao Zedong Thought to guide farming, and build a socialist new countryside." A soldier from a certain unit of the PLA, seeing the victory of the Chinese table tennis team, excitedly said, "The Chinese table tennis team is a red flag in China's sports world. The great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought is held highest. Their process of competing with the Japanese team tonight is the process of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works." He also said, "The victory of the Chinese table tennis team is inevitable because they have a spiritual atomic bomb. This spiritual atomic bomb is none other than Mao Zedong Thought."

Two Red Guards from Beijing were overjoyed to see the Chinese team win the team championship. They said, the Chinese table tennis team's victory is fundamentally because they listened to Chairman Mao's words. They said, "We are not just here to watch the competition; we are also here to learn from the Chinese table tennis team. The spirit of daring to fight and being good at fighting is particularly worthy of us Red Guards' learning. In the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must dare to open fire on the 'Four Olds' and seriously study the Sixteen Points, using Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies to guide our actions."

Many foreign friends who watched tonight's competition also believed that the Chinese table tennis athletes once again achieved outstanding results, which is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. The female team leader of the Palestinian table tennis team, Yu Babari, said, "I knew China would win because the Chinese table tennis athletes study Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said, dare to struggle, dare to win. They listen to Chairman Mao's words, believe in their own victory, and therefore won."

After the competition, the leader of the Chinese table tennis team, Zhang Junhan, told reporters, "Although we have achieved some results, we are still far from the Party and people's requirements, far from the requirements of the great leader Chairman Mao. In the future, we will better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, learn from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, learn from the Red Guards, and continue to humbly learn from athletes from various countries. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we will strive for greater victories."

    毛泽东思想永远是胜利的旗帜
    ——记中国乒乓球队获得男女团体冠军
    三十日晚，北京工人体育馆里一万五千多中外观众，一直沉浸在欢乐中。我国乒乓健儿又一次为祖国争得荣誉，双双获得了本届北京国际乒乓球邀请赛的男女团体赛冠军。当我国乒乓健儿走上领奖台，举起红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》的时候，暴风雨般的掌声一浪高过一浪。观众齐声高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。人们尽情地欢呼：无产阶级文化大革命万岁！战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！万万岁！！
    晚上七时三十分，具有世界最高水平的中日两国乒乓球团体决赛开始了。首先进行的是女子团体冠军决赛。中国队出场的是林慧卿、郑敏之两位著名横握拍削球手，日本队出场的是直握拍选手、世界冠军深津尚子和著名选手山中教子。中国女子乒乓球队的这两位选手，在去年第二十八届世界乒乓球锦标赛时曾以三比○的优势战胜由深津尚子、关正子组成的日本女子队，从而第一次从日本队手中夺得女子团体世界冠军。今天，日本选手的进攻力比一年前加强了。中国选手的削球技术也更纯熟了。一年来，我国选手通过活学活用毛主席著作，精神面貌有了很大变化，战斗意志更旺盛了。因此，女子团体决赛一开始，就出现了扣人心弦的精采场面。郑敏之和山中教子在第一盘的比赛中，一攻一守争夺十分激烈。第一局，郑敏之在十七比二十落后的形势下，仍然十分镇定，一板一板把山中打过来的球削回去，终于追到二十平。以后，双方对每一个球都认真对待，因而比分从二十平、二十一平、二十二平，竟一直打到二十六平，最后由于郑敏之攻球失误，才以二十六比二十八失去第一局。但在第二、第三局中，郑敏之加强防守，不论对方大板扣杀，还是放近台短球，她都英勇顽强地救起来，削回去，几乎成为一道攻不破的铜墙。同时，在防守中一有机会就突然反攻得分，使山中经常处于被动地位。最后郑敏之以二十一比十六，二十一比十四连胜两局，反败为胜。
    除了双打一盘失利以外，郑敏之和林慧卿都是以二比○的优势战胜世界女子单打冠军深津尚子。而我国男子队，则充分发挥了我国乒乓球运动员快、狠、准、多变的风格，以五比○的优异战绩战胜日本队，实现了他们决心在比赛中显示毛泽东思想新胜利的宏愿。
    无产阶级文化大革命以来，我国的乒乓健儿发出誓言：在北京国际乒乓球邀请赛中夺取新的胜利。为了迎接和日本选手这场决战，在训练中，在比赛最紧张的时刻，运动员们坚持不懈地学习毛主席著作。他们把毛泽东思想当作自己一切行动的指导方针。按照毛主席的教导，解决思想上的问题，克服技术上、体力上的弱点。他们有一个共同的心愿，就是要使伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，在比赛中放射出更加灿烂的光辉。
    我国的工农兵群众完全理解这场比赛的重要意义。他们在热情洋溢的来信中，在充满革命激情的电话里，在亲切有力的握手间，一再用毛泽东思想激励乒乓球队员们打出风格、打出水平，打出毛主席教导出来的中国人民的革命风貌。在今晚的比赛中，有些观众给健儿们送来了最敬爱的毛主席的彩色画像，上面的两句引人注目的题词就是：“祝你们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，奋勇前进！”运动员们完全懂得，全国人民在和他们一起参加这场比赛，全国人民和他们一样要通过这场比赛显示毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。因此，世界冠军庄则栋一再表示：“决不辜负祖国人民的期望！”
    决心和愿望变成事实，并不是一件容易的事。比赛的对方日本队排出了最强的阵容，世界女子单打冠军深津尚子、日本男子单打冠军长谷川信彦等著名选手全部上阵。我国迎战的选手庄则栋、李富勇（原名李富荣）、周兰荪、林慧卿、郑敏之虽然都是乒坛名将，但仍然有不少困难。林慧卿、郑敏之在第二十八届世界乒乓球锦标赛中都输给过深津，这次能不能取胜？庄则栋前几天还在患感冒，李富勇直到今天上场时身体还不大好，能不能打好？运动员们明白，他们必须作出肯定的回答，而决不能有第二种选择。因此，在上场比赛之前，他们双手捧着《毛主席语录》，又一次宣誓：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    正像广大观众已经看到的那样，我国乒乓球健儿在今晚的比赛中完全实现了自己的誓言。他们打出了风格，打出了水平；他们说得到，做得到，他们不愧为毛泽东思想哺育下的祖国好儿女。
    中国女队教练容国团在比赛结束后说：中国乒乓球队今天又一次打败了世界强队日本乒乓球队。这是由于我们坚信，用伟大的毛泽东思想武装头脑，就能变成巨大的物质力量，就能无往而不胜。因此在比赛前，我们认真地学习了毛主席著作，坚决听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，活学活用毛泽东思想，解决比赛前运动员中的各种思想问题，做到一心一意投入到比赛中去，争取比赛的胜利。今天晚上，中国运动员入场比赛前，都认真地阅读了毛主席语录：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”
    郑敏之同山中教子对阵时，开始曾处于先失一局的不利形势，但当她看到自己根据毛主席教导写在手腕上的“排除万难，排除杂念”这八个字时，就勇气百倍，敢于进攻，在关键时刻不手软，终于连胜两局，反败为胜。
    男子队队员李富勇今天身体不大好，然而他学习了毛主席语录“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”以后，完全忘掉自己，只想到一定要打出中国运动员的革命风格来。今天下午他在连胜两名朝鲜优秀选手以后，晚上又一次作为主力队员出场，以顽强的革命意志战胜两名日本强手——福岛万治和相川雄二，为中国队赢得两分。
    前来观看比赛的广大工农兵群众、革命学生和革命干部，今天晚上显得特别兴奋。我国运动员连连取胜，一次又一次地激起他们对伟大的毛泽东思想无限热爱、无限信仰的革命豪情。一位来自大庆油田的工人兴奋地说：“太好了！太好了！他们打出了中国人民的风格。我们一定要把乒乓球队的革命精神，用到工业建设上去。”北京郊区一个公社社员说：“我们社员看了中国乒乓球队打球的风格，受到了很大的鼓舞。队员们打球都带着鲜红的《毛主席语录》，他们用毛泽东思想指导打球，我们社员一定要像乒乓球队一样，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想指导种田，建设社会主义的新农村。”解放军某部战士看到中国乒乓球队的胜利，激动地说：“中国乒乓球队是我国体育界的一面红旗，毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得最高。他们今晚和日本队比赛的过程，就是活学活用毛主席著作的过程。”他又说：“中国乒乓球队的胜利是必然的，因为他们有一颗精神原子弹。这颗精神原子弹不是别的，就是毛泽东思想。”
    北京市的两位红卫兵看到中国队获得团体冠军，高兴得手舞足蹈。他们说，中国乒乓球队之所以能胜利，最根本的是他们听了毛主席的话。他们说：我们不光是来看比赛，也是来向中国乒乓球队学习的，中国队敢于斗争，善于斗争的精神特别值得我们红卫兵学习，在当前无产阶级文化大革命中，要敢于向“四旧”开火，并且要认真学习十六条，用毛泽东思想和党的政策来指导我们的行动。
    观看今晚比赛的许多外国朋友们也认为，中国乒乓球健儿又一次取得出色的成绩，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。巴勒斯坦乒乓球队女领队尤·巴巴里说：“我早就知道中国会胜利，因为中国的乒乓球运动员们学习毛主席著作。毛主席说，要敢于斗争，敢于胜利。他们听毛主席的话，相信自己会胜利，所以胜利了。”
    比赛结束后，中国乒乓球队领队张钧汉对记者说，我们虽然取得了一些成绩，但距离党和人民的要求，距离伟大领袖毛主席的要求还相差很远。今后我们要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，向工农兵学习，向红卫兵小将学习，继续虚心向各国选手学习，在毛泽东思想的照耀下争取更大的胜利。
