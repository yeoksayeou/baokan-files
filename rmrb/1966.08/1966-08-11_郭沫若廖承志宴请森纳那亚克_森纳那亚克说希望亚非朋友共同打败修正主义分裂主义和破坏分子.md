	Guo Moruo and Liao Chengzhi Host a Banquet for Senanayake
	Senanayake Hopes Asian and African Friends Will Together Defeat Revisionism, Splittism, and Sabotage

	According to Xinhua News Agency, August 10th, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the Chinese Federation of Literary and Art Circles Guo Moruo, and Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity Liao Chengzhi, held a banquet today to warmly welcome Senanayake, the Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Writers Permanent Bureau, and his wife, who have made significant contributions to the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial movement of Afro-Asian writers.

	Liao Chengzhi and Senanayake both spoke at the banquet.

	Liao Chengzhi said in his speech that the Emergency Conference of Afro-Asian Writers was successfully held under the guidance of Secretary-General Senanayake. We believe that Secretary-General Senanayake will make even greater contributions to the future Afro-Asian writers' movement.

	Liao Chengzhi said that the statement passed by the Afro-Asian Writers Permanent Bureau and supported by the Emergency Conference of Afro-Asian Writers declared that the Soviet writers who engaged in splitist activities have, due to their deliberate sabotage of the Afro-Asian writers' movement, cut themselves off from the ranks of Afro-Asian writers and forever lost all rights and positions in the Afro-Asian Writers Permanent Bureau. This decision sets a good precedent for the Afro-Asian solidarity movement and other international organizations.

	Senanayake said in his speech that he hopes that the Asian and African friends present will join us in better fighting against all revisionism, splittism, and sabotage elements. He expressed his firm belief that, with the assistance of the Chinese Writers Association, this task can definitely be accomplished.

	Representatives from some member countries of the Afro-Asian Writers Permanent Bureau were invited to attend the banquet.

　　郭沫若廖承志宴请森纳那亚克
　　森纳那亚克说希望亚非朋友共同打败修正主义分裂主义和破坏分子
    据新华社十日讯　全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长、中国文学艺术界联合会主席郭沫若和中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志，今天举行宴会，热烈欢迎为亚非作家反帝反殖运动作出重大贡献的亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克和夫人。
    廖承志和森纳那亚克先后在宴会上讲话。
    廖承志在讲话中说，亚非作家紧急会议是在森纳那亚克秘书长的指导下取得成功的。我们相信秘书长先生对今后的亚非作家运动将作出更大贡献。
    廖承志说，亚非作家常设局会议所通过并得到亚非作家紧急会议支持的声明，宣布了从事分裂活动的苏联作家，由于蓄意破坏亚非作家运动，已经自绝于亚非作家的队伍，并且永远丧失了在亚非作家常设局中的一切权利和地位。这一决定为亚非团结运动和其他国际组织开创了一个良好的先例。
    森纳那亚克在讲话中说，我希望在座的亚非朋友和我们一起，更好地为打败一切修正主义、分裂主义和破坏分子而进行斗争。他表示深信，在中国作家协会的协助下，一定能完成这一任务。
    亚非作家常设局成员国一些代表应邀出席宴会。
