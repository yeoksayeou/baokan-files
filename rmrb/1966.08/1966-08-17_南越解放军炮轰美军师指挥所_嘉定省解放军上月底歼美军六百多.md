The South Vietnamese Liberation Army has been highly active in recent days, shelling a U.S. command post near Saigon, attacking a large contingent of puppet troops south of Da Nang, and ambushing U.S. invaders southwest of Pleiku.

According to Western news agencies, on the night of the 15th to the early hours of the 16th, the Liberation Army heavily shelled the command post of the U.S. First Infantry Division near Saigon with mortars. The shelling lasted nearly two hours, with shells raining down on the U.S. command post area, causing casualties and losses among U.S. forces. This command post is only about twenty kilometers from Saigon, so "the sound of mortar explosions echoed through Saigon," causing great panic among U.S. and puppet forces. On the 16th, the Liberation Army also ambushed a U.S. military convoy near a puppet police station in Saigon, which was heading towards a nearby large oil depot in Go Vap.

Near Qui Nhon, south of Da Nang, the Liberation Army launched an attack on a battalion of South Vietnamese puppet marines on the 13th.

In the Drang Valley southwest of Pleiku, the Liberation Army ambushed several companies of the U.S. First Cavalry Division in the afternoon of the 14th. According to reports, initially, the Liberation Army heavily ambushed a company of U.S. troops. Then, the U.S. invaders airlifted several companies of troops to the area for rescue, but as soon as they arrived, they were again hit by heavy artillery fire from the Liberation Army, suffering heavy casualties.

According to a supplementary report from the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, the Liberation Army in Gia Dinh Province, South Vietnam, launched two heavy attacks on the U.S. 25th Infantry Division's 2nd Brigade in Cu Chi District from the night of July 26 to the early hours of July 27, killing 423 U.S. invaders and wounding 200.

According to the report, the Liberation Army also destroyed and damaged 60 enemy tanks and armored vehicles, destroyed four 105mm cannons, one 155mm cannon, and four aircraft, burned down two power stations and 177 parachute tents, and destroyed 432 parachute tents.
