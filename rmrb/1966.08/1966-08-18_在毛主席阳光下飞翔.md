We are the flight attendants of China's civil aviation. We fly year-round over the skies of our motherland and friendly countries around the world. On the plane, we often see the people of our country and foreign friends expressing their immense love for our great leader Chairman Mao. Many foreign friends enthusiastically sing the praises of "Mao Zedong, the red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people and the people of the world," and praise "Chairman Mao's words, each one shining with the light of truth." Whenever we hear such passionate voices, our hearts cannot remain calm.

Most of the sisters in our flight attendant team come from working-class families. In the old society, our fathers and brothers suffered cruel exploitation from capitalists and landlords, living in poverty and cold. Now, not only have we gained education, but more importantly, Mao Zedong Thought has nurtured us into flight attendants who serve the people of China and the world.

We grew up under the red flag and have not personally experienced class exploitation and oppression. The Party leads us to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's theories on class and class struggle, helping us understand the bloody history of the old society, arousing our deep hatred for the exploitative system, and making us love the Party and Chairman Mao with all our hearts. With Mao Zedong Thought in our minds, when we go abroad and see the lifestyle of the bourgeoisie, we feel extremely disgusted. In the past, some people only saw high-rise buildings and cars when they went abroad. After studying, when they went there again, they saw slums and homeless beggars, feeling even more that living in socialist New China is so happy!

Mao Zedong Thought illuminates our hearts, gives us boundless strength, and makes us have a heart hotter than fire to serve the people. We think that to serve the hearts of the passengers, we must always consider the passengers. When passengers board the plane, in summer, we immediately hand them fans and cool towels; in winter, we quickly serve them hot tea. Seeing passengers tired, we quietly pull down the curtains to block the glare of the sun and cover them with warm blankets. Among the passengers, there are often elderly and sick people. We treat these passengers like family, taking extra care to assist them on and off the plane. It is through these small, ordinary things that we achieve Chairman Mao's teaching of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people.

In April this year, Dai Xinxin and Zhou Wensha were tasked with escorting Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou. We regarded this task as a trust and commission from the Party and the people. Before departure, we brought two quotation boards to hang in the large and small cabins, using Chairman Mao's thought of "not fighting unprepared battles, not fighting battles without certainty" to guide us. We thought: Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou, for the dignity of our motherland, bravely defended the national flag. The Indonesian fascist thugs shot him, and his injuries were severe. On the plane, we should take extra care. Upon arriving in Guangzhou, we consulted with the flight doctor to understand the condition, knowing that Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou had only drunk a cup of orange juice during a period of flight, had not eaten anything, and had difficulty breathing. He had surgery upon arrival in Guangzhou. Based on this situation, we prepared a urinal, a drinking tube, and an oxygen mask.

After Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou boarded the plane, his temperature was high. With the doctor's consent, we turned on the ventilation and used a hot towel to wipe his face. After takeoff, he drank a cup of orange juice, and later, Xiao Zhou fed him congee and chicken soup with a small spoon. At that time, we had only one wish: to take good care of Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou, which would be the most powerful response to the Indonesian thugs and the most direct support to our comrades at the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia. Along the way, Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou was in good spirits. After completing the task, the accompanying diplomat Qin said: "What we thought of, you thought of; what we didn't think of, you also thought of. On behalf of the embassy's comrades, I express my thanks." He carefully cut a corner of the national flag that protected Zhao Xiaoshou and gave it to the crew as a memento. This is the most precious gift, which greatly encouraged the crew members.

We often have to receive foreign passengers. If our service work is done well, it can add a bit of glory to our country, the Party, and Chairman Mao. Many foreign passengers praise our good work, seeing it as a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. To better serve the revolutionary people of the world, young flight attendants study foreign languages diligently. Every time they go to a country or a place, they carefully observe and inquire about local customs and habits, recording all this in their own "little encyclopedia." Only in this way can we serve every passenger's heart. Once, a foreign passenger asked a Chinese flight attendant: "Do you know which country I am from?" The flight attendant immediately replied: "You are from Peru." The passenger then asked: "Do you know where Peru is and what its capital is?" She answered: "Your country is on the west coast of South America, and the name of the capital is Lima." The Peruvian passenger was moved and said: "Mao Zedong cares about us, and every Chinese person cares about us."

A Spanish passenger said: "I have flown on many countries' planes, their service is superficial and formal, only China's service is heartfelt and genuine." Many foreign passengers said: "Chinese flight attendants can serve the hearts of passengers, which shows the revolutionary thoughts and spirit of the Chinese people."

Sometimes, when the flight attendants stay abroad, they think of themselves as flight attendants of the Mao Zedong era. Each person strictly demands of themselves and resolutely takes Chairman Mao's thoughts as the highest standard for our actions.

Last July, our crew accompanied the Chinese delegation to Romania. We stayed in a hotel, and every day an elderly service worker in his seventies brought meals to our crew members. Everyone respected this old man, and after each meal, they rushed to help him clean up the dishes and take them to the kitchen. The old man was deeply moved and said with tears: "In the past, I have served many countries' flight personnel, they were all arrogant, and I have never heard a single 'thank you.' I have lived for over seventy years and have never seen people who love labor so much. You are good flight personnel taught by Mao Zedong. I wish I could live another seventy years to serve you."

During flights, we see the revolutionary people of the world loving Chairman Mao everywhere. On the plane, some foreign passengers see magazines praising the Communist Party and Chairman Mao and ask for them as souvenirs. Every time the plane flies over Hunan, foreign passengers eagerly look for Chairman Mao's hometown. Every time we play "The East Is Red" and "The Great Ship Sails on the Boundless Ocean" and other records, many foreign passengers request them to be played again and again. When singing "China has given birth to Mao Zedong," "Mao Zedong Thought is the unsetting sun," foreign friends cannot help but clap and sing along. Seeing such moving scenes, we are so excited!

Once, a Japanese youth hummed the first verse of "The East Is Red" in Chinese in the cabin. Every time he sang "Mao Zedong," his emotions were very excited. After a while, the Japanese youth asked the flight attendant Zhu Lingying to teach him the second verse of "The East Is Red," saying: "I like to sing 'The East Is Red' the most." The flight attendant sang, and the Japanese youth quickly wrote down the lyrics in his notebook. Soon, the cabin was filled with the resounding revolutionary song.

One morning in April, the plane to Shanghai took off. Flight attendant Lü Lingying was serving in the cabin. In the first row, there was an African youth with curly hair. Lü Lingying noticed that this young man was always smiling at people, feeling a bit puzzled, and asked him: "Why are you so happy?" The African youth excitedly said: "You don't understand. I visited your China, sat on a Chinese plane, and especially saw the great achievements of the Chinese people, I am very happy in my heart. These great achievements are the victories of Mao Zedong Thought. I want to take Mao Zedong Thought back to Africa. I hope you can fly to Africa."

Last year, we escorted Premier Zhou on his visit to West Asia and Africa. On the streets of Cairo, a young Egyptian recognized us as Chinese and spontaneously raised his hand to cheer: "China—Mao Zedong! Long live China!" In Tanzania and Mali, adults and children there all knew how to say "China, hello!" in Chinese. Children playing on the street, seeing us in the car, all waved and danced. Far from our motherland, we saw the African people loving our great leader Mao Zedong and our New China so much, our hearts were immediately filled with warmth and affection.

There is a foreign song that sings: "Mao Zedong Thought is the unsetting sun, it illuminates the vast China, and also illuminates the hearts of the fighting people of the world." Yes, Mao Zedong Thought is the red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people and the people of the world. The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought shines all over the world.

　　在毛主席阳光下飞翔
　　中国民航北京管理局第一飞行总队乘务中队
    我们是中国民航的随机乘务员。常年飞翔在祖国和世界各友好国家的上空。在飞机上，我们经常看到祖国人民和外国朋友对我们伟大领袖毛主席怀着无比的热爱。很多外国朋友热情地歌颂“毛泽东是中国人民和世界人民心中的红太阳”，赞扬“毛主席的话句句闪烁着真理的光芒”。每当听到这种热情洋溢的声音，我们的心情总也不能平静。
    我们乘务队的姐妹们绝大多数出身在劳动人民的家庭。在旧社会，我们的父兄，受尽了资本家和地主的残酷剥削，过着吃不饱、穿不暖的日子。现在我们不光有了文化，更重要的是，毛泽东思想把我们哺育成为一个为中国人民和世界人民服务的人民乘务员。
    我们在红旗下长大，没有亲身经受过阶级剥削和阶级压迫。是党领导我们反复学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的理论，使我们了解了旧社会血泪斑斑的往事，激起了对剥削制度的无比仇恨，使我们对党和毛主席怀着无限热爱。我们的头脑里有了毛泽东思想，去外国，一看到资产阶级生活方式，就感到十分厌恶。过去有些人到外国只看到高楼大厦和汽车，学习以后再到了那里，就看到了贫民窟和流离失所的乞丐，更加感到生活在社会主义的新中国是多么幸福！
    毛泽东思想照亮了我们的心，给我们增添了无穷的力量，使我们有一颗比炉火还热的为人民服务的心。我们想，要服务到旅客的心坎上，就要处处为旅客着想。当旅客一登上飞机，夏天，我们立即把扇子和凉毛巾送到旅客手里；冬天，很快送去热茶。看到旅客疲倦了，就悄悄地把窗帘拉上，挡住耀眼的阳光，为旅客盖上御寒的毛毯。旅客中时常有一些老人和病人，我们把这些旅客当亲人一样加倍照顾，搀扶他们上下飞机，我们就是通过一件又一件的平凡“小事”，做到毛主席教导的“完全”、“彻底”地为人民服务。
    今年四月，戴鑫玲和周文莎担任了接赵小寿同志的任务。我们把这项工作看作是党和人民的信任和委托。出发前带了两个语录板挂在大小客舱，用毛主席“不打无准备之仗，不打无把握之仗”的思想来指导我们。我们想：赵小寿同志为了祖国的尊严，奋不顾身，保卫国旗，印度尼西亚法西斯暴徒向他开了枪，伤势很重，在飞机上更应加倍照顾。到了广州就找航医了解病情，知道赵小寿同志经过一段时间的飞行，只喝了一杯橘子水，啥也没吃，呼吸困难，到广州还动了手术。根据这种情况，我们就准备了可以大小便的便盆，喝水的蜡管，吸氧的面罩。
    赵小寿同志上飞机后，体温挺高，我们征求医生同意后，把通风器打开，用热毛巾给他擦脸。飞机起飞后，他喝了一杯橘子水，后来小周用小勺给他喂了稀饭和鸡汤。当时，我们只有一个心愿：照顾好赵小寿同志，就是对印度尼西亚暴徒最有力的反击，对我驻印度尼西亚大使馆的同志们最直接的支援。一路上，赵小寿同志精神很好。任务完成后，陪送赵小寿同志的邢参赞说：“我们想到的，你们给想到了；我们没想到的，你们也想到了，我代表大使馆的同志们表示感谢。”并把赵小寿同志保护的国旗细心地剪下一角，送给机组作纪念。这是一份最珍贵的礼物，使机组的同志们受到极大的鼓舞。
    我们时常要接待一些外国旅客。我们的服务工作做好了，就能为祖国为党为毛主席增添一分光彩。有不少外国旅客赞扬我们工作好，他们把这看作是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。为了更好地为世界革命人民服务，年青的乘务员们顽强地学习外国语，每到一个国家，一个地方，都要仔细观察、询问当地的风俗人情，把这些都记在自己的“小百科全书”里。这样才能把服务工作做到每一个旅客的心坎上。有一次，一位外国客人问中国乘务员：“你知道我是哪国人吗？”乘务员立即回答：“您是秘鲁人。”客人又问：“你知道秘鲁在哪里，首都是什么地方吗？”她答道：“您的国家在南美洲的西海岸，首都的名字叫利马。”这位秘鲁旅客感动地说：“毛泽东关心我们，每个中国人都关心我们。”
    有位西班牙旅客说：“我乘过好多国家的飞机，他们的服务是表面的、形式的，只有中国的服务是内心的、实在的。”许多外国旅客说：“中国的服务员能服务到旅客的心坎上，这表现了中国人民的革命思想和革命精神。”
    有时，乘务员们住在国外时，想到我们是毛泽东时代的乘务员，每一个人都严格要求自己，坚决把毛主席的思想作为我们行动的最高准则。
    去年七月，我们机组随中国代表团到罗马尼亚。我们住在一个旅馆里，每天有一位七十多岁的老服务员给我们机组同志送饭。大家对这位老人都很尊敬，每天吃完饭，都抢着帮老人收拾餐具，送到厨房去。这位老人感动极了，他流着泪说：“过去我接待过许多国家的飞行人员，他们对我都是趾高气扬，从来没有听到过一次‘谢谢’。我活了七十多岁，没有见过这样热爱劳动的人。你们是毛泽东教导的好飞行人员，我愿意再活七十岁，来为你们服务。”
    在飞行中，我们到处看到世界革命人民热爱毛主席的动人情景。在飞机上，有些外国客人看到歌颂共产党和毛主席的画报，就要求送给他们作纪念。每当飞机经过湖南上空的时候，外国旅客都要留连地寻视毛主席的故乡。每当我们放《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》等唱片的时候，许多外国旅客要求一遍又一遍地放送。唱到“中国出了个毛泽东”，“毛泽东思想是不落的太阳”的时候，外国朋友会情不自禁地拍着手跟着唱起来。看到这样动人的情景，我们是多么兴奋啊！
    有一回，一位日本青年在客舱里低声用中国话反复哼《东方红》第一段歌词。每当唱到“毛泽东”三个字的时候，他的情绪都很激动。过了一会儿，这位日本青年请求乘务员朱玲英教他唱《东方红》第二段歌词，他说：“我最喜欢唱《东方红》这支歌。”乘务员一边唱，日本青年就迅速地把歌词抄在小本上。很快，昂扬的革命歌声充满了客舱。
    今年四月的一天早晨，去上海的飞机起飞了。乘务员吕鸾英在客舱里服务。第一排座，坐着一位头发卷曲的非洲青年。吕鸾英发现这个青年人老是瞅着人笑，心里有点纳闷，便问他：“您怎么这么高兴？”这位非洲青年激动地说：“你不明白，我在你们中国的土地上参观，坐中国的飞机，特别看到中国人民所取得的伟大成就，我心里就非常高兴。这些伟大成就都是毛泽东思想的胜利。我要把毛泽东思想带回非洲去。希望你们飞到非洲去。”
    去年，我们送周总理访问西亚、非洲。在开罗的街上，一个阿联青年认出我们是中国人，就情不自禁地举手欢呼：“中国——毛泽东！中国万岁！”在坦桑尼亚和马里，那里的大人、孩子都会用中国话讲：“中国，你好！”正在街上玩的孩子，一看到我们坐在车上，就都一边向我们招手，一边跳起舞来。远离祖国的我们，看到非洲人民这样热爱我们伟大的领袖毛主席，热爱我们的新中国，心里顿时洋溢着温暖而亲切的感情。
    有一首外国歌这样唱道：“毛泽东思想是永远不落的太阳，它照亮了辽阔的中国，也把全世界战斗的人民心儿照亮。”是的，毛泽东思想是中国人民和世界人民心中的红太阳，毛泽东思想的光辉普照全世界。
