Chairman Mao said: The school system must be shortened, education must be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating our schools must not be allowed to continue.

Bring Culture Back to the Hands of the Laborers

Seize the Pen

Chairman Mao said: “In China, it has always been the landlords who have culture, while the peasants have none. Yet the culture of the landlords is created by the peasants, because the things that make up the landlords' culture are nothing but the blood and sweat taken from the peasants.” This is exactly how it has been in old China for thousands of years.

In the old society, the doors of schools were open only to the children of the exploiting classes. People like us, who were poor and herded cattle, had no right to enter schools. My father suffered greatly because he was illiterate. He always wanted me to learn some culture. After he went to Shanghai to work as a porter, he borrowed and saved money to send me to school in the village. However, in the foreign-run schools, there was no place for us. I herded cattle and went to school intermittently for a few days, then was pushed out of the school gates. There was no choice, so at the age of fourteen, I followed my father to Shanghai to work for the capitalists.

We have been working for the landlords and capitalists since we were young. The landlords and capitalists, however, used the blood and sweat they extracted from us to establish schools for their children, so that they could wield the pen and exploit and oppress us generation after generation.

In the old society, the pen in the hands of the exploiting class was more ruthless than guns. On one hand, they relied on guns to seize political power from us; on the other hand, they used the pens in their hands to deceive and fool us laboring people, consolidating their reactionary rule. If we did not listen to their nonsense and harmed their interests, they would wave their pens, deducting wages, firing us, or writing a report to have us imprisoned and prosecuted.

In the old society, I hated those literary figures of the exploiting class and those foreign-run schools that trained the children of the exploiting class. At that time, I thought that one day, when we workers rose up, took power, and became masters, we must seize the pens from the bourgeoisie, establish new schools that suit our wishes, and bring culture back to the hands of the laborers.

Do Not Allow Schools to Train “Spiritual Aristocrats”

After liberation, the Party and Chairman Mao truly opened the doors of schools to us laboring people. Chairman Mao, based on the need to cultivate successors of the proletariat, proposed the educational policy of serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor. This completely aligns with the wishes of the laboring people.

However, those bourgeois representatives who infiltrated the educational sector harbored deep hatred and fear towards the cultural emancipation of the laboring people. They feared that the workers, peasants, and soldiers would seize the pens. They used their authority to control the educational front, refused to implement the educational policies of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and stubbornly clung to the framework of bourgeois education. They framed the offspring of the exploiting class into schools and framed the children of workers, peasants, and soldiers out of schools. They even used these frameworks to corrupt the workers' and peasants' children who had entered schools, luring them onto the path of individual struggle and personal gain, serving only to produce successors of the bourgeoisie.

After liberation, our factory recruited more than twenty technical personnel with college degrees, but only a few were truly from worker or poor peasant backgrounds. Why did the children of the exploiting class have more opportunities to advance in education, while the children of laboring people had fewer? Was it because the children of the exploiting class were naturally intelligent, while ours were born stupid? No. This was the result of the stubborn implementation of the bourgeois educational system by the bourgeois representatives.

My daughter, Lù Huìqín, was often reminded by me when she was in middle school to study Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions to become a revolutionary successor of the proletariat. Whenever she returned home, I had her participate in some labor and do some good deeds. The child performed fairly well at home. However, at school, some teachers said she was mediocre and stupid. Her Russian was poor, and the teachers did not help her but instead pressured her, deducted her points, and made her drop out. I was very angry and had her drop out of school and go to work in the factory.

When she entered the factory, I told her the family history and the painful life I experienced as an apprentice, so that she would always remember the class hatred. I also gave her a copy of the “Quotations from Chairman Mao” to arm her mind with Mao Zedong Thought and become a good worker. The child paid attention to studying Chairman Mao's works with questions in mind and was humble in learning from old workers. She made progress relatively quickly, and many old workers praised her intelligence. Soon, she joined the Communist Youth League and was evaluated as an outstanding apprentice.

Why did the same person, who was called stupid by school teachers, become intelligent in the eyes of the workers? Did she suddenly become intelligent? No, this is the different reaction of two classes and two standpoints towards things. What workers like and praise, the bourgeois gentlemen do not like or praise; what the bourgeois gentlemen like and praise, we workers do not like or praise. Our factory has some who were once praised by bourgeois professors and scholars as “excellent students” but performed poorly after entering the factory. They did not study Chairman Mao's works, did not integrate with the workers, but buried themselves in technical books, wanting to become some “expert,” “master,” or “specialist.” What is even more heartbreaking is that some young people with good backgrounds, after going to school and being influenced by bourgeois ideology, also followed the bourgeois path after graduation, pursuing fame and wealth, seeking comfort, not actively participating in practical struggles, and not willing to go among the workers, gradually distancing themselves from the thoughts and feelings of the laboring people.

At first, we did not fully understand these problems; we just felt something was wrong and that the current schools were not to our liking. After studying the Party Central Committee's decision on educational reform and the editorial of the People's Daily, our minds became clear, and we realized that this was a serious class struggle. Only by thoroughly overthrowing the old educational system can we establish a new one. This great educational revolution concerns the issue of cultivating what kind of successors, the issue of whether Mao Zedong Thought can be passed down from generation to generation, and the issue of whether our Party and country will change color. We must thoroughly reform the old educational system according to Chairman Mao's instructions and absolutely not allow our schools to cultivate “spiritual aristocrats” again.

Rely on Mao Zedong Thought to Revolutionize Education

Chairman Mao often emphasizes: “Without destruction, there can be no construction; without blocking, there can be no flow; without stopping, there can be no progress.” This is the truth. Daring to destroy the old is the key to innovation; without thoroughly destroying the old, the new cannot be established. Without thoroughly eliminating the anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought black line on the educational front, the proletarian educational policy cannot be implemented.

In my more than ten years of technological innovation, I have had a deep understanding of destruction and construction. If I have achieved some success in technological innovation, the fundamental reason is that I listened to Chairman Mao's words, dared to break the old frameworks, foreign frameworks, and rigid frameworks; dared to defy bourgeois “authorities,” dared to defy “foreigners,” and surpassed “foreigners.” Regardless of whether it is old machinery or foreign machinery, if it is not up to standard, change it. If it does not exist, create it. Whether changing or creating, it is not restricted or bound by the old frameworks, foreign frameworks, and rigid frameworks. You say it is not up to standard, not regular, I do not care about your nonsense. After all, you cannot frame my mind or bind my hands; I believe in practice. In this way, I innovated more than twenty types of machines.

I think that to innovate, one must destroy to construct. To reform education, one must prioritize destruction and dare to destroy and construct. Without daring to destroy the old, the new cannot be established. In the sixteen years since liberation, the old educational system has not been thoroughly changed because the influence of bourgeois educational thought has not been thoroughly criticized, the educational system of the bourgeoisie has not been thoroughly smashed, and the proletarian educational policy formulated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao has not been thoroughly implemented.

To destroy the old and establish the new, what should we rely on to destroy and what should we rely on to establish? We must rely on Mao Zedong Thought, the most powerful weapon. In this cultural revolution, we must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Only by studying and applying Chairman Mao's works well can we have a clear direction and bright eyes, can we expose all the bourgeois representatives and all the ghosts and snakes on the educational front, can we uproot the old roots of the bourgeois educational system, and can we smash the bourgeois family treasures.

Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts. We have relied on Mao Zedong Thought to stand up and be liberated, to make revolution and build the country, and we cannot do without Mao Zedong Thought for a moment. Therefore, we laboring people love to read Chairman Mao's books the most, and we hope our children read Chairman Mao's books the most. Now, the Party Central Committee's decision to make Chairman Mao's books a compulsory course in schools has touched our hearts, and we fully support it and absolutely agree with it, and we demand its immediate implementation. We want the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought to forever fly high on the proletarian educational front and forever fly high in the hearts of the proletariat and laboring people, so that our descendants, generation after generation, will forever read Chairman Mao's books, forever listen to Chairman Mao's words, forever act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, never change color, and forever be revolutionary.

### 让文化回到劳动者手里来

    毛主席说：学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。
    让文化回到劳动者手里来
    山西晋生纺织厂工人出身的副总工程师　陆福庆
    把笔杆子夺回来
    毛主席说：“中国历来只是地主有文化，农民没有文化。可是地主的文化是由农民造成的，因为造成地主文化的东西，不是别的，正是从农民身上掠取的血汗。”旧中国几千年来的历史事实，正是这个样子。
    在旧社会，学校的门儿，是专朝那些剥削阶级子弟开的。象我们这号穷光蛋、放牛娃，根本没资格进学校。我爹吃尽了不识字的苦头，总想供我学点文化。他到上海当了搬运工人以后，东借西凑闹下几个钱，送我在村里上了学。可是，洋学堂里哪有我们的立足之地？我一边放牛，一边上学，断断续续念了几天书，就被推出学校门外了。没法子，十四岁上就跟我父亲到上海给资本家做工去了。
    我们从小就给地主、资本家做工。地主、资本家却用从我们身上榨取的血汗，为他们的子女办学校，让他们掌握笔杆子，好世世代代地剥削压迫我们。
    在旧社会，剥削阶级手里的笔杆子真比刀枪还凶。他们一方面依靠枪杆子来专我们的政；另一方面又依仗他们手中的笔杆子，来欺骗、愚弄我们劳动人民，巩固他们的反动统治。要是不听他们的那一套鬼话，损害了他们的一点利益，他们的笔杆子一挥，不是扣工资，就是开除，或者写张状子，让你坐牢吃官司。
    在旧社会，我恨透了那些剥削阶级文人，恨透了那些专门培养剥削阶级子女的洋学堂。当时我想有朝一日我们工人翻了身，当了家，作了主人，一定要把资产阶级手里的笔杆子夺过来，开办适合我们工人心愿的新学校，让文化回到劳动者手里来。
    不许学校再培养“精神贵族”
    解放后，党和毛主席真正把学校的大门给咱劳动人民打开了。毛主席根据培养无产阶级接班人的需要，提出了教育为无产阶级的政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的教育方针。这完全符合我们劳动人民的心意。
    可是，那些钻到教育界里的资产阶级代表人物，对于劳动人民文化大翻身，怀着刻骨的仇恨，非常害怕工农兵群众掌握了笔杆子。他们利用职权，把持教育阵地，拒不执行党中央和毛主席提出的教育方针，顽固地抱住资产阶级教育制度的框框不放。他们把剥削阶级的孝子贤孙优先“框”进学校中去，把工农兵群众的子女尽量“框”在学校之外。甚至用这些框框来腐蚀进了学校的工农子弟，引诱他们走个人奋斗的白专道路，专门为造就资产阶级的接班人服务。
    解放后，我们厂来了二十几个大专毕业的技术人员，其中真正出身于工人、贫下中农家庭的只占少数。为什么剥削阶级的子女升学的多，劳动人民的子女升学的少呢？是他们的子女天生聪明，我们劳动人民的子女生来愚笨吗？不是。这是那些资产阶级代表人物坚持实行资产阶级教育制度的结果。
    我的女儿陆惠琴，在她上中学的时候，我经常嘱咐她好好读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，将来当一个无产阶级革命接班人。她一回家，我就让她参加一些劳动，办一些好事。这孩子在家里表现得还算不赖。可到了学校，有些老师就说她没出息，脑子笨。她的俄文不好，老师也不帮助她，只是一股劲地给她施加压力，扣她的分，让她退班。我很生气。于是让她退了学，进厂做工。
    进厂时，我给她讲家史，讲我当学徒时的痛苦生活，让她永远记住阶级仇。我还送给她一本《毛主席语录》，让她用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，当一个好工人。这孩子很注意带着问题学习毛主席著作，很注意虚心向老工人学习，进步比较快，许多老工人都夸她聪明，不久就入了团，并被评为优秀徒工。
    为什么同样一个人，学校的老师说她脑子笨，厂里的工人夸她聪明呢？是她一下子由笨变聪明了吗？不是，这是两个阶级两种立场对待事物的不同反应。工人喜欢和称赞的，那些资产阶级老爷们就不喜欢、不称赞；而那些资产阶级老爷们所喜欢和称赞的，我们工人就不喜欢、不称赞。我们厂就有一些曾被资产阶级教授、学者称赞为“学业优良”的“好学生”，进厂后却表现得很糟糕。他们不学习毛主席著作，不和工人结合，一头钻到技术书里，一心想钻出个什么“家”，什么“师”，什么“者”来。更痛心的是，有些出身好的年轻人，上了学校，受了资产阶级思想的影响，毕业出来以后，也闹资产阶级那一套，追逐名利，贪图安逸，不积极参加实际斗争，不愿到工人群众中去，同劳动人民的思想感情越离越远。
    对于这些问题，起先我们不甚理解，只是觉得不对味，觉得现在的学校办得不合我们的心意。学习了党中央关于教育改革的决定和《人民日报》社论，脑子里一下子就亮堂了，认清了这是一场严重的阶级斗争。只有彻底打倒旧的教育制度，才能建立起新的教育制度。这次教育制度的大革命，关系到培养什么样的接班人的大问题，关系到毛泽东思想能不能一代一代传下去的大问题，关系到我们党和国家变不变颜色的大问题。我们一定要按照毛主席的指示来彻底改革旧的教育制度，决不许我们的学校再去培养“精神贵族”。
    靠毛泽东思想闹教育革命
    毛主席经常强调：“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行。”这是真理。敢于破旧，才能创新；旧的不破，新的不立。不彻底搞掉教育战线上的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的黑线，无产阶级的教育方针就不能贯彻执行。
    我在十几年的技术革新中，对于破和立有比较深刻的体会。要说我在技术革新上有一些成就的话，最根本的原因就是听了毛主席的话，敢于破旧框框、洋框框、死框框；敢于藐视资产阶级“权威”，敢于藐视“洋人”，超过“洋人”。不管你是哪国货，不管你是老牌机器，还是洋牌机器，不合格，就改。没有的，就造。改也好，造也好，都不受那旧框框、洋框框、死框框的限制和束缚。你胡说我不合格，不正规，我不理你那一套。反正你“框”不住我的脑子，套不住我的手，我相信的是实践。就这样我革新了二十多种机器。
    我想，搞革新，必须破，才能立。搞教育改革，也必须破字当头，敢破敢立。不敢破旧，就不能立新。解放十六年来，旧的教育制度所以没有彻底改变，就是因为没有彻底批判资产阶级教育思想的影响，没有彻底打烂资产阶级的教育制度，没有贯彻执行党中央和毛主席制定的无产阶级的教育方针。
    破旧立新，靠什么破，靠什么立呢？必须靠毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器。在这场文化大革命中，我们要更好地活学活用毛主席著作。只有学好用好毛主席著作，才能方向明，眼睛亮，才能把教育战线上的资产阶级代表人物和一切牛鬼蛇神统统揪出来，把资产阶级教育制度的老根子统统挖出来，把资产阶级的传家宝统统砸碎。
    毛主席是我们心中的红太阳。我们是靠毛泽东思想翻身得解放的，我们是靠毛泽东思想闹革命搞建设的，我们一刻也离不开毛泽东思想。因此，我们劳动人民最爱读毛主席的书，我们最希望自己的孩子读毛主席的书。现在党中央关于把毛主席的书作为学校必修课的决定，说到了我们的心坎上，我们完全拥护，绝对赞成，并要求立即执行。我们要让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，永远在无产阶级教育阵地上高高飘扬，永远在我们无产阶级、劳动人民心目中高高飘扬，让我们的儿孙后代，世世代代都永远读毛主席的书，永远听毛主席的话，永远照毛主席的指示办事，永不变色，永远革命。
