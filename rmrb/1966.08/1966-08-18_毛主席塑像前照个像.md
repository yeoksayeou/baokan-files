A Greek merchant ship made its first visit to Qingdao. Before the ship docked at the pier, the crew members eagerly applied to the border inspection personnel for permission to go ashore. After receiving their permits, they joyfully disembarked.

Once ashore, they visited the sailors' club, where they saw the gigantic statue of our great leader Chairman Mao. They specially purchased traditional Chinese clothing at the club, changing out of their suits and into Mao suits, and stood in a respectful posture in front of the statue of our great leader to have their photo taken. They said, "We are fortunate to have come to China and to have our photo taken in front of the statue of the greatest person in the world—Mao Zedong. This is the greatest happiness of our lives." They repeatedly gave thumbs up, exclaiming, "Mao Zedong is truly the greatest person in the world!"

After taking the photo, they reluctantly left the gigantic statue of Chairman Mao and, with hearts full of satisfaction, returned to their ship.

　　毛主席塑像前照个像

    一艘希腊商轮首次来青岛。轮船未靠码头之前，船员们纷纷向我登轮工作的边防检查人员申请登陆。他们拿到登陆证，兴高采烈地上岸了。
    登陆后，他们到了海员俱乐部，看到了我们伟大领袖毛主席的巨大塑像。他们在俱乐部里特地买了中国的服装，脱掉西服，换上中山服，以端正的姿态站在我们伟大领袖塑像前照了个像。他们说：“我们能够来到中国，能够在世界上最伟大的人物——毛泽东的塑像前照一张像，这是我们一生最大的幸福。”他们还不住地伸出大拇指说：“毛泽东真正是世界上最伟大的人物！”
    他们照完像，才依依不舍地离开了毛主席的巨大塑像，心满意足地回到了船上。
