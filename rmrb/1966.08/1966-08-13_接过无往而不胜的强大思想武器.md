Just as the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of the capital's universities and colleges were pushing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to a climax, the Party Central Committee sent people to deliver the most powerful ideological weapon—the *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*.

Nearly 120,000 university and college students, teachers, and staff each received a copy. This news was too good, too exciting.

Some schools heard this good news the night before. They were so excited that they didn't sleep all night. They spread the word to each other, and their long-cherished wish was fulfilled. Early in the morning, they rushed to the school gate to wait, hoping to receive this powerful ideological weapon that guides the proletarian revolution as soon as possible.

At 10 a.m. on August 12, a decorated car from the Xinhua Bookstore in Haidian District arrived at the gate of Peking University. Inside and outside the gate, a sea of people had already gathered. Countless portraits of Chairman Mao, Mao's quotations, and red flags were waving. The shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao," the song "The Ship of State Needs a Helmsman," the drum beats, and the firecrackers echoed through the sky.

Tens of thousands of people, including teachers, students, and staff from Peking University and students from various schools in the capital, had never seen such a moving scene or encountered such a fortunate moment. Who wouldn't want to hold a copy of the *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*? Who wouldn't be eager to study the works of Chairman Mao? Their shouts echoed the voices of hundreds of millions of people across the nation.

People were so excited that all their thoughts turned into shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!"

People shouted enthusiastically, and the decorated car moved slowly. The decorated car seemed to be carrying a load of sunshine. Look at those excited, singing, and laughing young people, the pioneers of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Aren't they the ones nurtured and grown under the sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought? Aren't they the ones, under the guidance and encouragement of Mao Zedong Thought, who fearlessly sweep away all ghosts and monsters with great courage?

The decorated car moved slowly. From the school gate to the auditorium, a distance of less than a mile, the decorated car took an entire hour to pass, and people shouted for an entire hour.

At the celebration meeting, the brave warrior of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Nie Yuanzi, spoke amidst enthusiastic applause. She said, "Just as we are about to launch a fierce attack on the black gang of Lu Ping and Peng Peiyun, each of us has a set of the *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, the sharpest weapon. We can defeat all enemies and break through all reactionary fortresses."

At the celebration meeting, the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Peking University solemnly received this powerful ideological weapon—the *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*—sent by the Party Central Committee, holding it tightly in their hands. They sang "Mao Zedong's Book is the Treasure of the Revolution." Yes, it is with Mao Zedong Thought that we make the revolution, and it is with Mao Zedong Thought that we have established a proletarian dictatorship. Today, we must rely on Mao Zedong Thought to defend our proletarian dictatorship.

When they received Chairman Mao's book, how many people were moved to tears. Peng Jixin, a student from the Department of Geophysics, said, "I am the son of a poor peasant and an orphan. It is the Party and Chairman Mao who have raised me. I love to read Chairman Mao's book and listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. In the practice of struggle, I deeply feel: to make a revolution, one must study and apply the great Mao Zedong Thought well."

When they received Chairman Mao's book, how many people recalled their eager desire to buy this "treasure book." Tian Yucheng, a first-year student in the Department of Philosophy and the daughter of poor and lower-middle peasants, said, "Five years ago, I cried and begged my mother for money to buy this treasure book. A year ago, I stood in a long queue in front of a bookstore hoping to buy this treasure book. But these wishes were not fulfilled." Today, when she personally received this treasure book, she said with great excitement, "Dear Chairman Mao! I swear to you: I will read your book for a lifetime, listen to your words for a lifetime, and act according to your instructions for a lifetime, carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end and forever defending our socialist red mountains."

Today, decorated cars delivered Chairman Mao's works to other institutions in the capital. Wherever the decorated cars went, there were shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" that echoed endlessly.

The revolutionary teachers and students of Tsinghua University shouted, "We have finally waited for the red family treasure—the red sun of Mao Zedong Thought."

The revolutionary teachers and students of Renmin University shouted, "Chairman Mao's book is our stronghold for making the revolution!"

The revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing Normal University, upon receiving the *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, immediately wrote a report of joy, holding the "red book" and singing and dancing, came to the people's reception station at the Party Central Committee's location, and swore to Chairman Mao, "We will follow Chairman Mao and make the revolution for a lifetime!"

Day after day, month after month, year after year, we have waited. Today, Chairman Mao's works have finally been received. This is the greatest care and encouragement from the Party. It has strengthened the courage and confidence of the revolutionaries. The tens of thousands of revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of the capital's universities and colleges, with long spears in hand today, will certainly demolish one reactionary stronghold after another in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and sweep away all ghosts and monsters.

　　接过无往而不胜的强大思想武器
    正当首都各大专学校革命师生员工把无产阶级文化大革命推向高潮的时候，党中央派人送来了最强大的思想武器——《毛泽东选集》。
    近十二万大专学校的革命师生员工，人手一部。这个消息太好了，太激动人心了。
    有的学校头天晚上就听到了这个好消息。他们激动得一夜没睡觉。他们奔走相告，梦寐以求的愿望实现了。他们一清早就跑到校门口去等候，希望把这一指导无产阶级革命的强大的思想武器最早最快地接到手里。
    八月十二日上午十时，海淀区新华书店送毛主席著作的彩车，来到了北京大学门前。门里门外，早已汇成一片人海。无数高举着的毛主席画像、毛主席语录牌和红旗在舞动。“毛主席万岁”的欢呼声、《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声、锣鼓声、鞭炮声，响彻云霄。
    成千成万的人，这里有的是北大师生和员工，有的是首都各学校的学生。他们中间，谁也没有看到过这样动人的场面，谁也没有遇到过这样值得庆幸的时刻。他们谁不想手执一部《毛泽东选集》呢？他们谁不是如饥似渴地要想学习毛主席著作呢？他们的欢呼声中，响着全国亿万人民的心声。
    人们是那样地激动，他们心中的千言万语，都化为“毛主席万岁！”的欢呼声。
    人们尽情地欢呼，彩车缓缓地移动。彩车仿佛载的是满车阳光。你看那些欢呼、欢唱、欢笑的青少年们，那些无产阶级文化大革命中的闯将们，他们不正是在毛泽东思想的阳光照耀下，培育成长的吗？他们不正是在毛泽东思想的指引和鼓励之下，以大无畏精神横扫一切牛鬼蛇神的吗？
    彩车缓缓地移动。从校门口到大礼堂，不到一里长的路，彩车整整走了一个钟头，人们整整欢呼了一个钟头。
    在庆祝大会上，无产阶级文化大革命的勇敢的战士聂元梓，在一片热烈的掌声中讲了话。她说：“正当我们向陆平、彭珮云黑帮猛烈开火的前夕，我们每人有了一套《毛泽东选集》，就有了最锐利的武器，我们就能战胜一切敌人，攻破一切反动堡垒。”
    在庆祝大会上，北大革命的师生和员工们，庄严地接过了党中央发下的这一强大的思想武器——《毛泽东选集》，紧紧地握在手中。他们高唱《毛主席的书是革命的宝》。是的，我们正是靠毛泽东思想闹革命，正是靠毛泽东思想打出了一个无产阶级专政的天下。今天，我们更要靠毛泽东思想，保卫我们的无产阶级专政。
    当接过了毛主席的书，多少人感激得流了泪。地球物理系学生彭吉新说：“我是贫农的儿子，又是一个孤儿。是党和毛主席把我培养成人的。毛主席的书我最爱读，毛主席的话我最爱听。在斗争实践中，我深深感到：要革命，就要学好用好伟大的毛泽东思想。”
    当接过了毛主席的书，多少人忆起了如饥似渴地想买这部“宝书”的事。哲学系一年级学生、贫下中农的女儿田玉成说：“五年前，我曾在母亲面前哭着闹着要钱要买这部宝书。一年前，我曾在书店前排在长长的队伍里想买这部宝书。可是这些愿望都没有实现。”今天，当她亲手接过这部宝书的时候，她说出了多么激动的话：“亲爱的毛主席！我向您发誓：我一定读一辈子您的书，听一辈子您的话，一辈子按照您的指示办事，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，永远保住我们的社会主义红江山。”
    今天，一辆辆的彩车，还把毛主席著作送到首都其他院校。彩车开到哪里，哪里就欢声雷动，经久不息地高呼“毛主席万岁！”
    清华大学革命师生欢呼：“我们终于盼来了红色的传家宝——毛泽东思想的红太阳。”
    人民大学革命师生欢呼：“毛主席的书是我们闹革命的靠山！”
    师范大学的革命师生接到《毛泽东选集》，立刻写了喜报，手捧“红书”，载歌载舞，来到党中央所在地的群众接待站，向毛主席宣誓：“我们一定跟着毛主席闹一辈子革命！”
    天天盼，月月盼，年年盼。今天，毛主席著作终于盼到了手。这是党的最大的关怀，也是最大的鼓舞。这增强了革命者的勇气，也增强了他们的信心。首都大专学校成千成万的革命的师生员工们，今日长缨在手，一定会在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，摧毁一个又一个的资产阶级反动堡垒，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。
