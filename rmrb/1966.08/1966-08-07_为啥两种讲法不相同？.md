	Why Are Two Approaches Different?
	Soldier of the People's Liberation Army, Lú Jùchéng

	When I was in high school, I studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune." The teacher's method of teaching was: read, explain words and phrases, divide into sections, summarize the main theme, analyze the writing style, and finally require us to "memorize." However, regarding Comrade Norman Bethune's internationalism and his selfless communist spirit, the teacher only briefly mentioned it and did not require us to learn from it.

	After I enlisted, I studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" again. This lesson was taught by our political instructor. Before the class, the instructor carefully analyzed the issues existing among us new recruits. For example, at that time, I wanted to be a technical soldier and did not want to be an infantryman. The instructor then addressed our issues in teaching this lesson. He did not require us to memorize the text but instead, combined with our actual situation, explained every word, every sentence, and every point in Chairman Mao's article deeply and thoroughly. He repeatedly explained to us the great significance of studying this lesson and required us to be like Norman Bethune, a true proletarian internationalist soldier. He detailed Norman Bethune's internationalist spirit and selfless communist spirit, and I was deeply moved.

	This lesson truly hit the mark. From then on, I tasted the sweetness of studying Chairman Mao's works and loved to read more. I decided to be an infantryman for life and serve the people for life. In this way, I worked diligently for the Party, was evaluated as an outstanding soldier every year, and joined the Party.

	Two different teaching methods yield two different results: one is the bourgeois teaching method, which rejects Mao Zedong Thought and instills bourgeois "knowledge" into students; the other is the proletarian teaching method, which emphasizes Mao Zedong Thought and can better cultivate proletarian revolutionary successors.

	Two different teaching methods reflect two different standpoints and attitudes. The fundamental issue is the transformation of the teacher's worldview. Only by carrying out a revolution in the teacher's mind to promote proletarian thought and eliminate bourgeois thought can there be a revolution in teaching methods.

    为啥两种讲法不相同？
    解放军战士　卢炬成
    我读高中的时候学过《纪念白求恩》。老师讲课的方法是：读、解释词句、分段、归纳主题思想、分析写作特点，最后是要求我们“背”。而对白求恩同志的国际主义精神和毫无自私自利之心的共产主义精神，却三言两语地带过，并不要求我们去学习。
    我入伍后，又学习了《纪念白求恩》。这一课是由我们指导员上的。在上课之前，指导员就我们新兵中存在的问题作了仔细的分析。比如我当时的问题是要当技术兵，不愿当步兵。指导员就针对我们的问题来讲这一课。他没有要求我们死读硬背，而是结合我们的实际情况，把毛主席这篇文章的每一个字、每一句话、每一个观点，讲深讲透。他反复给我们讲明学习这一课的重大意义，要求我们象白求恩那样，当一个真正的无产阶级国际主义战士。他详细地给我们讲了白求恩同志的国际主义精神和毫无自私自利之心的共产主义精神，我听了深受感动。
    这一课真是打中了我的要害。从此，我尝到了学习毛主席著作的甜头，越读越爱读。我决心当一辈子步兵，为人民服务一辈子。就这样，我踏踏实实地为党工作，年年被评上五好战士，并且入了党。
    两种不同的教学方法，得出两种不同的效果：一种是资产阶级的教学方法，它排斥毛泽东思想，给学生灌输资产阶级的“智”；一种是无产阶级的教学方法，它突出毛泽东思想，能够更好地培养无产阶级的革命接班人。
    两种不同的教学方法，体现了两种不同的立场和态度。根本问题还是教师的世界观的改造问题。只有在教师的头脑里来一番兴无产阶级思想、灭资产阶级思想的革命，然后才有教学方法上的革命。
