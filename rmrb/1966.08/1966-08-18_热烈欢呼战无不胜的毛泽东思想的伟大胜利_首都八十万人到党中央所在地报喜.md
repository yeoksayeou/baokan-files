The capital's 800,000 people go to the Party Central Committee's location to report good news

		They unanimously express their determination to resolutely and bravely carry out the tasks outlined in the communiqué and decisions, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, to carry the socialist revolution through to the end, and to strive for the realization of the Third Five-Year Plan and to build our country into a powerful socialist state.

		Xinhua News Agency, August 17th: The people of the capital are united in their hearts with our great Party, and the people of the capital will forever follow the great leader Chairman Mao. Over the past ten days, the entire city of Beijing has been immersed in unprecedented joy and inspiration. Revolutionary masses numbering 800,000 have gone to the Party Central Committee's location to report good news. People cheer for the Party Central Committee's decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, cheer for the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, and cheer for the great leader Chairman Mao's meeting with the revolutionary masses of the capital. The crowd unanimously shouts, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years live!"

		Over the past ten days, the capital has been filled with good news. On the 8th, the Party Central Committee's decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was published; on the 10th, our most beloved leader Chairman Mao met with the revolutionary masses of the capital; on the 13th, the communiqué of the Party Central Committee plenary session, presided over by Chairman Mao, was issued. During this period, revolutionary masses also received the newly published "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." The good news for the entire Party and the nation came one after another. Wherever the good news spread, there was joy and excitement. Like a tidal wave, the crowds reporting good news braved the rain and the scorching sun, filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, and surged towards the reception station for the masses at the Party Central Committee's location. Many people went again and again, and even workers building roads in distant mountain areas and community members from far-flung suburbs came from afar, beating drums and gongs, and joyfully rushed to the scene. For ten days, the crowds reporting good news have been continuous. Long-time residents of Beijing said that so many revolutionary masses, for such a long time, and so excitedly taking to the streets to cheer, this is unprecedented in Beijing.

		In countless reports of good news and declarations of resolve, people expressed their boundless love, faith, and admiration for the great leader and helmsman Chairman Mao. They cheered for Chairman Mao's series of brilliant decisions over the past four years and their glorious victories, for the revolutionary scene of the whole nation being hot and vibrant under the sun of Mao Zedong Thought; they cheered for the great leader's heart-to-heart connection with the revolutionary masses, his boundless care and trust for the revolutionary masses; they cheered for the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution sweeping away all ghosts and monsters, smashing an old world, and building a new world; they cheered for the great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

		The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the capital, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres expressed their determination to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to study Chairman Mao's works more consciously, and to study and propagate the Party Central Committee's decisions and communiqué more seriously and actively. They will resolutely and bravely carry out the battle tasks outlined in the decisions and communiqué, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, carry the socialist revolution through to the end, and strive for the realization of the Third Five-Year Plan and to build our country into a powerful socialist state. They also expressed their determination to respond to the great call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, to definitely liberate Taiwan, to definitely support the Vietnamese people in defeating the American aggressors, and to be a hundred times more vigilant, ready at any time to smash the sudden attacks of American imperialism and its accomplices.

		According to Xinhua News Agency, August 17th: On August 16th, the crowds of the capital reporting good news continued to surge towards the reception station for the masses at the Party Central Committee.

		In the cheering crowd, there was an elderly woman with white hair, holding a golden "double happiness" character with both hands, walking onto the stage. She could not contain her excitement and sang with enthusiasm the song she loved the most, "I Love to Read Chairman Mao's Book."

		As the song ended, countless revolutionary masses rushed to shake her hand. She said excitedly, "To witness such a great revolutionary event, I, an old woman, am too happy. I want to sing a song for Chairman Mao to hear!"

		The old woman's name is Hu Junqing. She is a family member of an old Red Army soldier and actively studies Chairman Mao's works. She does not know how to read, so her husband reads to her sentence by sentence. "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution." This is the first sentence of Chairman Mao's words that her husband taught her. In the evening, when her children return home, she quickly takes out the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and asks them to read a passage to her. She also forms a study group with a few others to study Chairman Mao's works, setting aside two and a half days a week to invite a revolutionary cadre resting at home to read the quotations and explain the situation. This spring, the neighborhood committee gave her Chairman Mao's works, and she was so moved that she shed tears of joy. Since then, her enthusiasm for studying Chairman Mao's works has been even greater.

		Hu Junqing introduced to the reporter how she learned the song. She said, "The song 'I Love to Read Chairman Mao's Book' is just like what I think. I not only love to listen to it but also really want to learn it. I sang along with the radio, and after three days, I learned it. After the Party Central Committee's decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was published, on the evening of August 10th, we went to report good news to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and we heard that Chairman Mao had just met with the revolutionary masses. I was so happy that I couldn't sleep all night. At that time, I thought, if I were to see Chairman Mao that day, I would say, 'Chairman Mao, please don't leave, let me sing a song for you!' On the 16th, we went again to express our determination to the most beloved leader Chairman Mao. I was too happy and too excited, and I sang the song on the stage."

    一致表示要最坚决最勇敢地执行公报和决定提出的战斗任务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把社会主义革命进行到底，为实现第三个五年计划、为把我国建设成为强大的社会主义国家而奋斗
    新华社十七日讯　首都人民心心向着我们伟大的党，首都人民永远跟着伟大的领袖毛主席。十天来，整个北京一直沉浸在无比欢乐和鼓舞之中，前往党中央所在地报喜的革命群众达八十万人。人们欢呼党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定，欢呼党的八届十一中全会公报，欢呼伟大领袖毛主席会见首都革命群众，万众齐声高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    十天来，首都喜讯频传。八日，党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定公布；十日，我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席会见首都革命群众；十三日，毛主席亲自主持的党中央全会发表公报。在这前后，革命群众又喜得新出版的《毛泽东选集》。全党全国的大喜事一个接一个。喜讯传到哪里，哪里就一片欢腾。潮水般的报喜队伍，冒着大雨，顶着烈日，怀着革命豪情，涌向党中央所在地的群众接待站。许多人去了一次又一次，连百里外的山区筑路工人和远郊人民公社社员，也从老远的地方敲锣打鼓、兴高采烈地赶来。十天来，报喜的队伍一直连绵不断。久住北京的人们说，这么多革命群众，持续这么长时间，这么激动地走上街头欢呼，这在北京是前所未有的。
    在数不清的喜报和决心书里，人们表示了对伟大的领袖、伟大的舵手毛主席的无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜。他们欢呼毛主席近四年来一系列的英明决策的光辉胜利，在毛泽东思想阳光照耀下，举国上下一片热气腾腾的革命景象；欢呼伟大领袖和革命群众心连心，对革命群众无限关怀，无限信赖；欢呼史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命气势磅礴地发展，革命的人民横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，砸烂一个旧世界，建设一个新世界；欢呼战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    首都广大工农兵、革命知识分子和革命干部表示一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更自觉地活学活用毛主席著作，一定要最认真、最积极地学习和宣传党中央的决定和公报，最坚决、最勇敢地执行决定和公报所提出来的战斗任务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把社会主义革命进行到底，为实现第三个五年计划、为把我国建设成为一个强大的社会主义国家而奋斗。他们还表示坚决响应党中央、毛主席的伟大号召，一定要解放台湾，一定要坚决支援越南人民打败美国侵略者，一定要百倍提高警惕，随时准备粉碎美帝国主义和它的帮凶的突然袭击。
    据新华社十七日讯　八月十六日，首都群众的报喜队伍继续涌向党中央群众接待站。
    在欢呼的人流里，有一位白发苍苍的老太太，双手捧着送给最敬爱的党中央和毛主席的金色“囍”字，走上了主席台。她抑制不住内心的激动，热情洋溢地唱起了她最爱听、最爱唱的歌《毛主席的书我最爱读》。
    歌声刚落，无数革命群众就争着去和她握手。她激动地说：“赶上这么大的革命喜事，我老太婆太高兴了，决心要唱支歌儿给毛主席听听！”
    这位老太太名叫胡俊卿，是一位老红军的家属，平时积极学习毛主席著作，她不识字，自己读书有困难，就叫她的老伴一句句给她讲。“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”就是她老伴最先教给她的一句毛主席的话。晚上孩子们回来了，她就赶快拿出《毛主席语录》让他们给她读一段毛主席的话。她还和其他几个人组成学习毛主席著作小组，每周抽出两个半天的时间，请一位在家休养的革命干部给她们念语录，讲形势。今年春天，街道办事处给她们发毛主席著作，她拿到书，激动得掉下热泪。从这以后，她学习毛主席著作的积极性更高了。
    胡俊卿老太太向记者介绍了她学歌的经过。她说：“《毛主席的书我最爱读》这首歌，跟我心里想的一样，我不但爱听，还真想学会它。我跟着收音机一起唱，学了三天就学会了。党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定公布后，八月十日那天晚上，我们去向党中央和毛主席报喜，听说毛主席刚刚会见了革命群众，我高兴得通夜没睡着觉。当时我就想，那天我要是见了毛主席，我就说：‘毛主席啊！请你不要走，听我给你唱支歌儿吧！’十六日，我们再次去向最最敬爱的领袖毛主席表决心，我太高兴了，太激动了，我走上主席台到底唱了这支歌儿。”
