Chairman Mao said: "Socialism, this new thing, its birth must go through a serious struggle with the old things to be realized."

The half-work, half-study experimental class of the Mathematics Department at Wuhan University has grown and flourished in the struggle against the bourgeois "authorities." This experimental class was established according to Mao Zedong Thought. Its development inevitably had to clash with bourgeois educational ideas and systems. Li Da, Zhu Shoutian, and He Dinghua, who had seized control of Wuhan University, in order to maintain the bourgeois educational system, defend their reactionary positions, and keep their "thrones," over the years adopted a series of conspiracies to suppress, block, and politically slander the experimental class. This struggle over the new thing involved the question of cultivating what kind of successors; it involved the question of whether Mao Zedong Thought could be passed down from generation to generation; it involved the question of whether our Party and country would change color. What attitude to take towards the experimental class? Whether to actively support it or to suppress and persecute it, in reality, this was a struggle between supporting Mao Zedong Thought and opposing Mao Zedong Thought. In the struggle, the revolutionary teachers and students of Wuhan University, with the support of the higher-level Party committee, smashed the various persecutions of this black gang, expanded the influence of the experimental class, and developed and strengthened the position of the experimental class. The experimental class, this new thing, through a serious struggle with the old things, achieved victory.

Good Indeed

In 1958, when Wuhan University was carrying out a magnificent educational revolution, on September 12 of that year, our great leader Chairman Mao came to Wuhan University for an inspection. Chairman Mao paid great attention to the students' initiative to implement half-work, half-study and pointed out that this was a good thing, instructing the school leadership to actively support and encourage it. Chairman Mao's extremely important instruction greatly educated and inspired the revolutionary teachers and students of Wuhan University. After a period of preparation, in 1960, under the initiative of teacher Li Guoping of the Mathematics Department and with the approval of the then Party committee, this half-work, half-study experimental class was officially established.

Since its establishment, the experimental class has always held high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implemented the Party's educational policy, and fully demonstrated its unparalleled superiority. The teaching of the experimental class has six characteristics:

First, insist on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively, having an infinite love, faith, and reverence for Mao Zedong Thought, and taking Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding direction for all actions of the experimental class. The main course of the experimental class's political class is to study Chairman Mao's works and to study and apply them actively, linking them to one's own worldview. Since its establishment, all teachers and students of the experimental class have repeatedly studied more than sixty articles by Chairman Mao, including the "Three Constantly Serve" essays, "On Practice," and "On Contradiction." Some students originally had the idea of seeking fame and fortune, but after studying essays like "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People," they established the idea that learning and working are for the revolution, changing from looking down on manual labor and laborers to deciding to become ordinary working people.

Second, insist on implementing the policy of combining education with productive labor. They treat labor as a compulsory course, participating in production at the Wuhan Steel Company and the school's machine factory without interruption. In labor, they blend in with the workers, humbly learning from them. They have cultivated a good character of loving workers and loving labor. Old workers also warmly cultivate and guide them, helping them master some production knowledge and labor skills, generally reaching the level of first or second-class fitters. Workers say they "look like workers now."

Third, insist on linking theory with practice. Over the years, through participating in labor, they have applied the theoretical knowledge they have learned to production practice, learning it actively and using it well. They not only master the necessary mathematical knowledge but also, starting from actual needs, have learned courses in theoretical physics, electrical engineering, and radio technology, greatly enriching and expanding their knowledge domain.

Fourth, the experimental class adopts the teaching method of self-study as the main approach, advocating active study and application, and opposing rote learning, to cultivate students' ability to think and work independently. This teaching method greatly mobilizes students' subjectivity, liberates their minds, breaks superstitions, dares to study, dares to create, and actively learns, not becoming slaves to books. Practice has proven that students of the experimental class learn more knowledge and have better test results than those who insist on classroom teaching. Their graduation theses not only cover mathematics but also physics and solving actual production problems. Because they have strong independent working abilities, after graduation, they also perform well in work and study, winning praise from their work units.

Fifth, the tutoring teachers of the experimental class eat, live, work, and study with the students, establishing a new type of revolutionary teacher-student relationship. Teachers take the lead in all aspects, truly becoming examples for the students and receiving their love. Teachers especially care about the students' political and ideological growth, paying attention to daily political and ideological work. They not only care for the students comprehensively while they are in school but also, after the students graduate, maintain contact with most of them and continue to help each other.

Sixth, the experimental class has a clear political direction, a concise and effective organizational form, flexible teaching methods, and strong vitality, making it convenient to establish in factories, rural areas, and the army. The experimental class has no full-time political instructors or administrative staff. Political and ideological work, teaching work, and administrative work are all undertaken by the teachers, who are responsible for them. Because the teaching methods are flexible, teachers and students have more opportunities to act independently, with higher and stricter requirements, and everyone receives more practical training, which is beneficial for promoting the thought revolution of teachers and students.

Because the experimental class insisted on the proletarian educational policy, students have developed in terms of moral education, intellectual education, and physical education, becoming laborers with a certain level of socialist consciousness and culture. After going through various political movements and actual struggles, they have an infinite love for the Party and Chairman Mao. In the storms of class struggle, they see clearly, stand firmly, and hold steadfastly. In the summer of 1964, eleven students of the experimental class all graduated and were assigned to their work positions. Most of them performed well and quickly adapted to their new tasks.

The Test Cannot Be Failed

Although the experimental class demonstrated its superiority in practice, because this new thing, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and representing the new proletarian system, had to thoroughly smash and bury the bourgeois educational system in its growth process and destroy the rule of bourgeois "authorities" in the educational front, the experimental class has been an eyesore to them since its establishment. In 1961, Zhu Shoutian came to Wuhan University as the Party committee secretary. He colluded with Li Da and He Dinghua to completely negate the educational revolution of 1958 and was particularly hostile to the product of the educational revolution—the experimental class, trying every means to strangle it in its cradle. They first adopted the tactic of splitting and disintegrating, threatening and enticing students to leave the experimental class. When this failed, they used the excuse of "the school not being at ease about whether the students of the experimental class can learn anything" to propose that the students of the experimental class take the same exams as the students of the same grade in school, attempting to fail the experimental class.

The teachers and students of the experimental class had long understood: this was not just an exam but a struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat over two paths and two educational lines, a matter of life and death for the experimental class.

They were full of confidence, believing that the black gang's attempt to use bourgeois exam methods to fail the experimental class would never succeed. They stated: First, oppose. Because the experimental class does not advocate or inherit this set of bourgeois exam methods. Second, fear not. The experimental class, with Mao Zedong Thought as its guide, has a clear purpose of studying for the revolution. They learn the deepest, most actively, and best in combining learning with use, so they are completely confident of winning in this exam.

In early 1962, the first exam was on "Theory of Functions of a Complex Variable." The black gang pretended to be fair, setting "three rules" beforehand: First, invite a third party (neither a teacher of the experimental class nor a non-experimental class teacher) to set the exam questions; second, seal the exam papers; third, consider the exam content for both sides. However, they deleted three out of the eight questions, removing a question favorable to the students of the experimental class and retaining a question unfavorable to them. Despite this, the exam results showed that all students of the experimental class scored excellent, far surpassing the students who insisted on classroom teaching. The black gang, unwilling to accept defeat, then in June 1962, plotted the second exam on "Mathematical Physics Equations." This time, they broke their promise, setting the exam questions according to the lecture content of the same-grade students in school. The students of the experimental class participated in the exam according to this unfair question paper, and again, with excellent results, they surpassed the in-school students. At this point, they were even more flustered, attempting to use the despicable method of secretly changing the exam scores of the test-takers to achieve their goal of strangling the experimental class. This despicable act was immediately discovered by the teachers of the experimental class, and the conspiracy failed. Soon after, they conducted the third exam on theoretical physics. The exam results showed that most students of the experimental class scored excellent, with none failing. The facts ruthlessly smashed the black gang's conspiracy of three exams.

These three exams failed the black gang's conspiracy and demonstrated the superiority of the experimental class, expanding its influence. Many teachers and students who were previously unaware of the truth praised: "The experimental class is indeed good." The teachers of the Physics Department who participated in the exam also wrote three comments while grading: ① The students, although self-taught, have clear concepts of physics; ② Generally, they have mastered the basic content; ③ The students can use their own language to combine mathematics and physics to explain. They have learned well and understood. After the influence of the experimental class expanded, some students who originally insisted on classroom learning also requested to join the experimental class to study. Although the black gang suppressed the application letters, some students simply went directly to the experimental class to report.

Cannot Be Blocked

In the summer of 1964, the first batch of students of the experimental class graduated. Under the demand of the revolutionary teachers and students of the Mathematics Department, it has now developed into three experimental classes with eighty-seven students participating.

With the experience of the first batch of the experimental class and the teaching practice of the new experimental classes, the teachers and students of the experimental class deeply felt that the proletarian educational system is infinitely superior to all old capitalist and revisionist educational systems: First, teaching is closely linked to practice, linking with workers and peasants, and linking with the three great revolutionary movements, which can avoid producing revisionism or dogmatism; second, narrowing the three great differences, it can cultivate students to develop comprehensively in terms of morality, intelligence, and physical education, becoming laborers with socialist consciousness and culture; third, and most fundamentally, it can cultivate proletarian revolutionary successors. Therefore, they firmly believed that the experimental class established according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao would definitely develop and grow stronger in the struggle and were determined to run the experimental class better and better.

However, the black gang of Wuhan University and the reactionary bourgeois "authorities" were very afraid of the influence of the experimental class. They adopted various despicable methods such as blocking, obstructing, distorting black and white, and falsifying facts to deny the achievements of the experimental class, block the news of the experimental class, and strive to slander and eliminate the influence of the experimental class. The revolutionary teachers and students of the experimental class, to publicize the revolutionary direction of the experimental class and expand its influence, under the support of the revolutionary teachers and students of the Mathematics Department, launched a struggle against the black gang's suppression and blocking.

This year, the experimental class had a significant influence both inside and outside the school. Students eagerly requested introductions to the situation of the experimental class, but the black gang obstructed, arbitrarily announcing: "Do not talk about the experimental class, otherwise, it is against organizational principles." The revolutionary teachers and students of the experimental class, despite the threats, broke through various obstacles and still made introductions. Many colleges and universities in Beijing, Jilin, Zhengzhou, Lanzhou, Fujian, and other places sent people to the school to request introductions to the experience of the experimental class. The black gang also strictly blocked them or distorted the truth and did not allow the visitors to meet with the teachers and students of the experimental class. Once, a delegation from Jilin Normal University came to the school and repeatedly requested an introduction to the situation of the experimental class. This black gang even said: "The experimental class is 'four nos' (indicating no lectures, no answering questions, no correcting exercises, no exams)," greatly distorting the experimental class. The revolutionary faction of the Mathematics Department saw through the black gang's conspiracy, broke through their blockade, and had the deputy secretary of the Mathematics Department Party branch, Cui Jianrui, introduce the situation of the experimental class in detail to the visitors, vigorously publicizing the policy of running schools according to Mao Zedong Thought and fully introducing the superiority of the experimental class.

After four years of trial operation, the experimental class achieved results. The CPC Hubei Provincial Committee instructed the school to summarize the experience. However, the bourgeois authorities of Wuhan University not only did not execute it but also criticized and completely negated it. They completely overturned the first summary written by the revolutionary teachers and students of the experimental class. They also covered up the sky with one hand, making completely distorted and black-and-white-reversed revisions to the summary rewritten by the Mathematics Department. They were afraid to publish this shameful "summary" to the world. In October, the Ministry of Higher Education held a conference on science and engineering in higher education. These black gang members only handed over the "summary" to the tutoring teacher Chen Yintong of the experimental class participating in the conference half an hour before departure. Chen Yintong read this "summary" on the train and became more and more indignant. As soon as he got off the train, he fought with the black gang members. He told the black gang members: "Your 'summary' does not conform to the facts. You make such untruthful reports, and you should be responsible."

At the science and engineering conference, many colleges and universities requested introductions to the experience of the experimental class, but they were repeatedly obstructed by the black gang. However, under the struggle of the revolutionary teachers of the Mathematics Department, they finally achieved victory. The tutoring teacher Chen Yintong of the experimental class introduced in detail the process of the half-work, half-study experimental class of the Mathematics Department's growth and the situation of the struggle between the two paths in Wuhan University at the mathematics group meeting. His introduction was warmly welcomed. The reputation of the experimental class expanded from the school to the whole country.

Cannot Be Overthrown

The black gang's conspiracies to suppress and abolish the experimental class failed, so from February to June 1965, they fabricated a shocking counter-revolutionary political persecution, attempting to strangle the experimental class in one fell swoop.

Since February 1965, led by Zhu Shoutian, the black gang carefully planned, under the name of summarizing work, held an expanded branch meeting, instructing a small group of people in the Mathematics Department who were deceived by them to fiercely attack teacher Li Guoping and the Function Theory Party branch, framing Li Guoping and the Function Theory Party branch with various fabricated "crimes," saying that Li Guoping did not listen to the Party committee (referring to the Party committee then controlled by the black gang); saying that he opposed the three political courses, which was opposing the Party Central Committee; and putting a big hat on him: "Using bourgeois individual struggle to guide students to the capitalist road." The black gang also attacked the Function Theory Party branch, saying they followed the Li Guoping line and sang a different tune from the Party committee. Their purpose of attacking Li Guoping and Cui Jianrui and destroying the Function Theory Party branch was simply to thoroughly destroy the experimental class and resolutely oppose Chairman Mao's educational ideas and the Party's educational policy.

The CPC Hubei Provincial Committee has always been very concerned about the work of the experimental class. In the spring of 1965, the Provincial Committee instructed that the experimental class was doing well, so why did someone insist on opposing and negating it? Zhu Shoutian hid all the instructions from the Provincial Committee and did not convey them to the school Party committee.

The black gang's various persecutions of the revolutionary teachers and students of the experimental class aroused great indignation among many people. A young revolutionary cadre at Wuhan University, Lu Shuxuan, wrote a letter to the first secretary of the Provincial Committee, Wang Renhe, truthfully reflecting the situation. After receiving the letter, Wang Renhe immediately called Zhu Shoutian to inquire and pointed out that the experimental class teachers and students should not be fought against. However, Zhu Shoutian lied to his face and denied it, saying, "There has been no criticism of them." But after returning to the school, he used Wang Renhe's name to say: "We have reported to Wang Renhe, and we will continue to do so." Zhu Shoutian also boasted in Beijing: "The school situation is very good, with no problems, please rest assured, leaders." The black gang leader Zhu Shoutian of Wuhan University played all kinds of despicable tricks of deceiving superiors and oppressing subordinates, exposing his true colors as a thorough bourgeois conspirator, and also exposing the relationship between the Wuhan University black gang and the former black gang heads of the Propaganda Department.

Despite this, the revolutionary teachers and students of the Mathematics Department were fearless. They fully realized that this was a life-and-death class struggle. Under the leadership of the Party branch, the revolutionary teachers and students of Function Theory repeatedly studied the parts in "Quotations from Chairman Mao" about "class and class struggle," "Communist Party members," and "criticism and self-criticism," and studied Chairman Mao's "Speech at the National Conference on Propaganda Work of the Communist Party of China," and also used Chairman Mao's instructions on the educational revolution to analyze the political persecution launched by the black gang. After studying, their eyes became brighter, their minds more open, and their fighting spirit more soaring. They used Mao Zedong Thought, this sharpest weapon, to expose the enemy and defeat the enemy's one attack after another.

In early March, dark clouds pressed down on Luojia Mountain. The black gang, to weaken the strength of the revolutionary left, concentrated on destroying the Function Theory Party branch, transferring the Mathematics Department Party branch deputy secretary Cui Jianrui, who had been insisting on the educational revolution and directly leading the Function Theory Party branch to struggle, under the pretext of taking students to the countryside for labor, and sending some revolutionary leftists to Hunan for recruitment. They then formed a "teaching reform" working group with a group of bourgeois revisionists or people with serious individualism as the backbone, sending them to the Mathematics Department to gather with a small group of bad elements in the Mathematics Department, deceiving and pulling a group of people to fabricate various "crimes" of the experimental class, writing big-character posters, drawing cartoons, defaming revolutionary teachers and students, and calling the resolute revolutionaries Li Guoping and Cui Jianrui "madmen." Then, they forced the secretary of the Function Theory Party branch, Zhao Junfeng, to make a "self-criticism," attempting to use this opportunity to destroy this branch and "reorganize" the Mathematics Department Party branch committee to achieve the goal of thoroughly destroying the experimental class.

In this thrilling political struggle, the revolutionary teachers and students of the Mathematics Department fully demonstrated the spirit of proletarian backbone, fearing nothing, and launched a struggle of reasoning with these ghosts and snakes. In the struggle, they constantly and everywhere reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings, never forgetting class struggle, never forgetting to hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought. On May 24, the revolutionary left, at the struggle meeting organized by the black gang, sternly refuted their slanders against Li Guoping and the Function Theory Party branch, putting these black gang members in a desperate situation. In those days of intense struggle, the revolutionary leftist teachers and students studied Chairman Mao's works like hungry and thirsty people. After the news of Chairman Mao and Chairman Liu swimming in the Shisanling Reservoir and talking with swimmers was published in the newspaper, the secretary of the Function Theory Party branch, Zhao Junfeng, read it over and over again, feeling full of strength. She thought: Chairman Mao said there are countercurrents in the great rivers, so where in our forward path are there no countercurrents! I must temper myself in the great storms of class struggle and advance against the wind and waves.

In late June, when the revolutionary left of the Mathematics Department was struggling intensely with the black gang, the relevant central departments held a Beijing symposium to handle this counter-revolutionary persecution incident. Comrade Kang Sheng made a clear conclusion, pointing out that the direction of the half-work, half-study experimental class was correct. The news spread, and the revolutionary teachers and students of Wuhan University were overjoyed and spread the word. Before this, Zhu Shoutian had also been transferred from Wuhan University. The black gang's conspiracy of political slander against the experimental class failed, and the revolutionary left, with the support of the central and provincial committees, after a hard struggle, finally won the victory.

After a long and intense struggle, the half-work, half-study experimental class of the Mathematics Department of Wuhan University developed more vigorously. This is the result of the revolutionary teachers and students daring to struggle against the black gang members and reactionary bourgeois "authorities," and the result of the revolutionary teachers and students insisting on the educational revolution under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought.

Now, the battle cry of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has been sounded, and a surging revolutionary tide has risen on Luojia Mountain. This revolutionary tide is sweeping away the influence of the old educational ideas of the exploiting classes that have ruled for thousands of years since Confucius, and is fundamentally overthrowing the important stronghold of the reactionary bourgeois "authorities" and academic authorities in the ideological realm. The great Mao Zedong Thought and the proletarian educational revolutionary policy of the Party illuminate the entire forward path of Wuhan University. The new proletarian educational system will permanently replace the rotten bourgeois educational system. The once rampant black gang of Wuhan University is being thoroughly settled. The broad revolutionary teachers and students are full of fighting spirit. They are determined to raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    坚决按照毛泽东思想办学的一面红旗
    ——记武汉大学数学系半工半读试验班在同李达、朱劭天等黑帮作斗争中成长的经过
    毛主席说：“社会主义这样一个新事物，它的出生，是要经过同旧事物的严重斗争才能实现的。”
    武汉大学数学系半工半读试验班，正是在同资产阶级“权威”的斗争中发展壮大起来的。
    这个试验班是根据毛泽东思想创办的，它的发展必然要严重冲击资产阶级教育思想和教育制度。篡夺武汉大学领导权的李达、朱劭天、何定华黑帮，为了维护资产阶级教育制度，固守他们的反动阵地，保住他们的“宝座”，几年来对试验班采取了窒息、封锁、政治诬陷等一系列的阴谋迫害。这场对待新事物的斗争，关系到培养什么样的接班人的问题；关系到毛泽东思想能不能一代代传下去的问题；关系到我们党和国家变不变颜色的问题。对试验班采取什么态度？是积极支持，还是打击、迫害，这实际上，是拥护毛泽东思想和反对毛泽东思想之间的斗争。在斗争中，武大革命师生在上级党委支持下，粉碎了这伙黑帮的种种迫害，扩大了试验班的影响，发展和壮大了试验班的阵地。试验班这个新事物经过同旧事物的严重斗争，取得了胜利。
    好得很
    一九五八年正当武汉大学开展了轰轰烈烈的教育大革命的时候，这年的九月十二日，我们伟大的领袖毛主席来到武汉大学视察。毛主席在视察中对学生自觉要求实行半工半读的意见很重视，并且指出这是好事情，指示学校领导要积极予以支持和鼓励。毛主席的这个极其重要的指示，使武汉大学广大革命师生受到了极大的教育和鼓舞。经过一段时间的准备，一九六○年在数学系教师李国平同志的倡议下，经过当时的党委批准，这个系半工半读试验班就正式成立了。
    试验班成立以来，始终高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，坚决贯彻党的教育方针，充分显示了无可比拟的优越性。试验班的教学具有六个方面的特点：
    一、坚持活学活用毛主席著作，对毛泽东思想无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，把毛泽东思想作为试验班一切行动的指导方向。试验班政治课的主要课程就是学习毛主席著作，并且活学活用，联系自己改造世界观。试验班成立以来，全体师生已反复学习了毛主席的“老三篇”和《实践论》、《矛盾论》等共六十多篇著作。有些学生原来有成名成家的思想，学习了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等文章后，树立了学习和工作都是为革命的思想，由轻视体力劳动和体力劳动者，转变为下决心要当一个普通劳动人民。
    二、坚持贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合的方针。他们把劳动作为必修课，在武汉钢铁公司和学校机械厂坚持参加生产劳动，从来没有间断过。在劳动中，他们和工人打成一片，虚心向工人学习。养成了热爱工人、热爱劳动的良好品德。老工人对他们也热心培养和指导，使他们掌握了一些生产知识和劳动技能，一般地都达到了一级或二级钳工的水平。工人们说他们“象个工人的样子了”。
    三、坚持理论联系实际。几年来，他们通过参加劳动，把学到的理论知识用于生产实践中，学得活，用得好。他们不仅掌握了必要的数学知识，而且从实际需要出发，增学了理论物理、电工学、无线电学等课程，大大丰富和扩大了知识领域。
    四、试验班采取自学为主的教学方法，提倡活学活用，反对死读书，以培养学生独立思考和独立工作的能力。这种教学方法，大大发挥了学生的主观能动性，使他们解放思想，破除迷信，敢于读书，敢于创造，主动学习，不做书本的奴隶。实践证明，试验班学生比坚持课堂教学的学生学到的知识要多，考试的成绩要好。他们的毕业论文，不仅有数学方面的，还有物理和解决生产实际问题方面的。由于他们独立工作能力较强，毕业后，在工作和学习中，表现也很好，博得了工作单位的好评。
    五、试验班的辅导教师与学生同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习，建立了新型的革命的师生关系。教师在各方面都起带头作用，真正成为学生的表率，受到学生的爱戴。教师特别关心学生政治思想上的成长，重视做日常的政治思想工作，他们不但能够做到学生在校时对他们全面关心，而且学生毕业后，也能够和多数同学保持联系，继续互相帮助。
    六、试验班政治方向明确，组织形式短小精悍，教学方法机动灵活，有强大的生命力，便于到工厂、农村、部队去举办。试验班没有专职的政治辅导员和行政工作人员，政治思想工作、教学工作、行政工作，都由教师包干，负责到底。由于教学方法机动灵活，师生独立作战的机会多，要求更高更严，每个人都受到更多的实际锻炼，有利于促进教师和学生的思想革命化。
    正因为试验班坚持了无产阶级的教育方针，学生无论在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到了发展，成为一个有一定的社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。他们经过各项政治运动和实际斗争的锻炼，对党对毛主席无限热爱，在阶级斗争的风浪里，看得清，站得稳，顶得住。一九六四年暑假，试验班十一名学生全部毕业，分配到工作岗位后，绝大多数都表现较好，能迅速适应新的工作任务。
    考不垮
    尽管试验班在实践过程中，充分显示了它的优越性，但是由于这个用毛泽东思想武装起来的、代表无产阶级新制度的新事物，在成长过程中，必然要彻底粉碎和埋葬资产阶级的教育制度，摧毁资产阶级“权威”在教育战线上的统治，因此，试验班从开办以来，就成为他们的眼中钉。一九六一年，朱劭天来到武汉大学任党委书记，他和李达、何定华勾结在一起，对一九五八年教育革命加以全盘否定，对教育革命的产物——试验班更是百般仇视，千方百计要把它窒息在摇篮里。他们首先采取分化、瓦解的手法，威胁利诱学生离开试验班，这一计不成，又假借“试验班学生能不能学到东西，学校不放心”为名，提出试验班学生和在校同年级学生会考，企图考垮试验班。
    试验班的师生早就明白：这不仅仅是一场考试，而是一场资产阶级和无产阶级两条道路和两种教育路线的斗争，是关系到试验班生死存亡的问题。
    他们充满信心，认为黑帮们妄图以资产阶级的考试办法来考垮试验班的阴谋，是决不会得逞的。他们表示：第一，反对。因为试验班不主张、不继承这套资产阶级的考试方法。第二，不怕。试验班以毛泽东思想为指南，学生有明确的为革命而学习的目的，他们学得最深、最活，学用结合得最好，因此，他们完全有信心在这场考试中取得胜利。
    一九六二年年初，第一次会考“复变函数论”。黑帮们装出“公正”的样子，事先“约法三章”：第一，请第三者（既不是试验班教师，也不是非试验班教师）出考题；第二，密封考卷；第三，考试内容照顾到双方。但是出的八题，却被他们删改为五题。并且删去了一个对试验班学生有利的题目，保留了一个对试验班学生不利的题目。尽管这样，考试结果，试验班学生的成绩全部优良，大大超过了坚持课堂教学的学生。黑帮们不甘心失败，接着又在一九六二年六月策划第二次“数学物理方程”的会考。这次，他们背信弃义，由他们自己按在校同年级的讲课内容出题，试验班学生就按照这个不公正的试题参加考试，结果，又以优良的成绩胜过在校学生。这时，他们更慌了手脚，想以偷改考生试卷分数的卑鄙手法，来达到他们扼杀试验班的目的。这一卑鄙的行径，当场被试验班教师发现，阴谋没有得逞。过了不久，他们又进行第三次理论物理考试。考试结果，试验班大多数学生成绩优良，没有一个不及格。事实无情地粉碎了黑帮三次迫考的阴谋。
    这三次考试，考垮了黑帮们的阴谋，考出了试验班的优越性，扩大了试验班的影响。许多过去不明真相的师生都称赞：“试验班确实不错”。参加监考的物理系教师在评卷时也写下了三条评语：①学生虽然是自学的，但物理概念清楚；②一般的基本内容都掌握了；③学生都能用自己的语言，把数学和物理结合起来讲述。学得不错，学懂了。试验班影响扩大以后，一些原来坚持课堂学习的学生也要求参加试验班学习。尽管黑帮们把一封封申请书扣压下来，但是有的学生干脆就直接到试验班去报到。
    封不住
    一九六四年暑假，第一届试验班学生毕业了。在数学系革命师生的要求下，到现在已发展到三个试验班，有八十七名学生参加。
    有了第一届试验班的经验，以及新试验班的教学实践，使试验班的师生深切体会到，无产阶级教育制度无限优越于一切旧的资本主义和修正主义的教育制度：首先是，教学密切联系实际，联系工农，联系三大革命运动，可以避免出修正主义或教条主义；其次，缩小三大差别，能培养学生在德智体三方面全面发展，成为有社会主义觉悟有文化的劳动者；第三，也是最根本的一条，能够培养出无产阶级革命接班人。因此，他们坚信，按照党中央和毛主席指示办起来的试验班，一定能在斗争中发展壮大，决心要把试验班越办越好。
    但是，武汉大学黑帮们和资产阶级反动“权威”，对试验班的影响非常害怕。他们采取封锁、阻挠、颠倒黑白、篡改事实等种种卑劣手法，抹杀试验班成绩，封锁试验班消息，极力诋毁和消除试验班的影响。试验班的革命师生为了宣扬试验班的革命方向，扩大试验班的影响，在数学系革命师生的支持下，向黑帮们展开了一场压制和反压制、封锁和反封锁的斗争。
    这一年，试验班在校内外影响很大。学生们纷纷要求介绍试验班的情况，黑帮们横加阻挠，擅自宣布：“不准谈试验班，否则就是违反组织原则。”试验班的革命师生不顾威胁，打破种种阻挠，仍然作了介绍。北京、吉林、郑州、兰州、福建等地许多大专院校纷纷派人来校要求介绍试验班的经验，黑帮们也严密封锁，或者歪曲真相，并且不让来访者同试验班的师生见面。有一次，吉林师范大学派人来到学校，一再请求介绍试验班情况，这伙黑帮竟说：“试验班就是‘四不’（指不讲课，不答疑，不改练习，不考试）”，大肆歪曲试验班。数学系的革命派识破了黑帮这个阴谋，冲破了他们的封锁，由数学系的党总支副书记崔建瑞出面，详细地向来访者介绍了试验班的情况，大力宣传按照毛泽东思想办学的方针，全面介绍了试验班的优越性。
    试验班经过四年试办，取得了成绩。中共湖北省委指示学校总结经验。但是武汉大学的资产阶级当权派不但不执行，而且横加指责，全盘否定。他们全部推翻了试验班革命师生写的第一个总结。又一手遮天，对数学系重新写出的总结，作了完全颠倒黑白的篡改。他们作贼心虚，不敢把这个见不得人的“总结”公诸于世。十月份，高等教育部召开高等学校理工科会议，这些黑帮直到临行前半小时，才把“总结”交给参加会议的试验班辅导教师陈银通看，陈银通在火车上看了这个“总结”，越看越气愤，一下火车，就和黑帮们斗争上了。他对黑帮们说：“你们这个‘总结’不符合事实，你们作这种不实事求是的汇报，要由你们负责。”
    在理工科会议上，许多大专院校要求介绍试验班的经验，又遭到黑帮们一再阻挠，但是，在数学系革命教师的斗争下终于取得了胜利。试验班辅导教师陈银通在数学小组会上，详尽地介绍了从数学系半工半读试验班成长过程，看武汉大学两条道路斗争的情况。他的介绍受到了热烈的欢迎。试验班的声誉由校内扩大到全国。
            斗　不　倒
    黑帮们压制、取消试验班的种种阴谋未能得逞，于是，在一九六五年二月至六月，制造了一场骇人听闻的反革命政治迫害，妄图一举扼杀试验班。
    一九六五年二月以来，以朱劭天为首的黑帮，精心策划，以总结工作为名，召开总支扩大会议，指使数学系一小伙受他们蒙蔽的人，气势汹汹地向李国平教师和函数论党支部开火，给李国平和函数论党支部安上了一些莫须有的“罪名”，说李国平不听党委（指当时黑帮们把持的党委）的话；说他反对三门政治课，就是反对党中央；并且给他戴上一顶大帽子：“用资产阶级个人奋斗来引导学生走资本主义道路。”黑帮们还攻击函数论党支部，说他们走李国平路线，与党委唱对台戏。他们打击李国平、崔建瑞，整垮函数论党支部的目的，无非是妄图彻底摧毁试验班，坚决反对毛主席教育思想和党的教育方针。
    中共湖北省委一向非常关心试验班的工作。一九六五年春节，省委指示，试验班搞得不错，为什么有人硬要反对硬要否定？对省委的指示，朱劭天都一一隐瞒，不向学校党委会传达。
    黑帮们对试验班革命师生的种种迫害，引起了很多人极大的愤怒，武大一位年青的革命干部陆舒媏同志，写信给省委第一书记王任重同志，如实反映了情况。王任重同志接信后立即把朱劭天找去查问，指出不准斗争试验班师生，但是朱劭天却当面扯谎，矢口否认，说“并没有对他们批判。”而回校后却又盗用王任重同志的名义，说：“我们已向王任重同志汇报了，要继续搞。”朱劭天还在北京宣扬说：“学校形势很好，没有什么问题，请领导放心。”武大黑帮头目朱劭天耍尽了欺上压下、阳奉阴违的恶劣手法，暴露了他这个十足的资产阶级阴谋家的面目，同时也暴露出武大黑帮与前中宣部黑帮头子们的关系。
    尽管如此，数学系革命师生毫无畏惧。他们充分认识到这是一场最尖锐、最激烈的你死我活的阶级斗争。在党支部的领导下，函数论的革命师生反复学习了《毛主席语录》中关于“阶级和阶级斗争”、“共产党员”、“批评与自我批评”等部分，学习了毛主席《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》，并且用毛主席关于教育革命的指示，对黑帮们发动的这场政治迫害进行了分析。他们经过学习，眼睛更加明亮，胸怀更加开阔，斗志更加高昂。他们以毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器，揭露了敌人，打败了敌人一个又一个的进攻。
    三月初，珞珈山上乌云压顶。黑帮们为了削弱革命左派的力量，集中攻垮函数论党支部，把多年来坚持教育革命，直接领导函数论党支部进行斗争的数学系党总支副书记崔建瑞，以带学生下乡劳动为名调离学校，又把一些革命左派赶到湖南去招生，接着便组成了以一部分资产阶级修正主义分子或有严重个人主义的人为骨干的“教改”工作组，把他们派到数学系，同数学系的一小伙坏分子纠集在一起，欺骗、拉拢了一批人编造试验班的种种“罪状”，写大字报、画漫画，丑化革命师生，把坚决革命的李国平、崔建瑞称作“疯子”。然后，又威逼函数论党支部书记赵俊峰作“检查”，妄想乘此机会攻垮这个支部，“改组”数学系党总支委员会，以达到彻底摧毁试验班的目的。
    在这场惊心动魄的政治斗争中，数学系革命师生充分表现出了无产阶级的硬骨头精神，他们无所畏惧，向这些牛鬼蛇神展开了说理斗争。他们在斗争中时时处处重温毛主席的教导，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。五月二十四日，革命左派在黑帮们组织的斗争会上义正词严地驳斥了他们对李国平、对函数论党支部的污蔑，使这伙黑帮处于狼狈的被斗境地。在那严重斗争的日子里，革命左派师生如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作。当报纸上刊载了毛主席和刘主席畅游十三陵水库时与游泳运动员谈话的消息以后，函数论党支部书记赵俊峰一遍又一遍地读着，浑身充满了力量。她想：毛主席讲大江大河里有逆流，在我们前进的道路上，哪里又没有逆流呢！我一定要在阶级斗争的大风大浪里经受锻炼，迎着风浪前进。
    六月下旬，正当数学系革命左派和黑帮斗争激烈的时候，中央有关部门召开了北京座谈会，处理了这场反革命迫害事件。康生同志作了明确的结论，指出半工半读试验班的方向是正确的。消息传来，武大革命师生欢欣鼓舞，奔走相告。在这以前，朱劭天也被调离了武大。朱劭天等黑帮对试验班的政治诬陷的阴谋未能得逞，革命左派在中央和省委的支持下，经过艰苦的斗争，终于赢得了胜利。
    武汉大学数学系半工半读试验班经过长期尖锐激烈的斗争以后，更加生气勃勃地向前发展了，这是革命师生敢于同黑帮分子、反动的资产阶级“权威”进行斗争的结果，是革命师生在毛泽东思想哺育下坚持教育革命的结果。
    现在，无产阶级文化大革命的战斗号角吹响了，珞珈山上卷起了排山倒海的革命浪潮，这个革命浪潮，正在冲击从孔夫子以来统治了几千年的剥削阶级旧的教育思想影响，正在从根本上推翻资产阶级反动“权威”和学阀在意识形态领域里的一个重要堡垒。伟大的毛泽东思想和党的无产阶级教育革命的方针照亮了整个武汉大学前进的道路，新型的无产阶级教育制度将要永远代替腐朽的资产阶级教育制度。曾经嚣张一时的武汉大学的黑帮们正在被彻底清算，广大革命师生斗志昂扬，他们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
