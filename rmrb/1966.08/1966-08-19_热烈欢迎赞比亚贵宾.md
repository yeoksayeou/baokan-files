A delegation from the Republic of Zambia, led by Vice President Kaunda, arrived in Beijing today for a friendly visit to our country. The Chinese people warmly welcome the arrival of Vice President Kaunda and other distinguished guests from Zambia.

The people of Zambia are a brave people. They have fought relentlessly against colonialism for nearly eighty years, finally achieving independence in 1964. Having won the struggle, they are determined to defend their victory.

The people of Zambia are a hardworking people. In the past, under the long and brutal rule of British colonialists, the people lived like cattle, and the rich land was impoverished. Today, the people of Zambia are building their country with their own hands, developing their national economy and culture. The Chinese people are genuinely pleased with the achievements Zambia has made in various fields since its independence.

Imperialism and old and new colonialism are trying every means to regain their lost positions in Africa. Therefore, the people of Zambia still regard opposing imperialism and colonialism as their top priority. The people of Zambia are not only fighting to maintain their own independence but are also actively supporting the struggles of the people of Zimbabwe and other African countries against colonialism and racism. The desperate struggles of imperialism will not stop the anti-imperialist revolutionary movement in Asia and Africa.

Since Zambia's independence, China and Zambia have established good relations based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The peoples of the two countries have always supported each other in the common struggle against imperialism. We believe that Vice President Kaunda's visit will make a positive contribution to further enhancing the friendly cooperative relations between China and Zambia and strengthening the friendship between the peoples of the two countries.

### 热烈欢迎赞比亚贵宾

　　热烈欢迎赞比亚贵宾
    以赞比亚副总统卡曼加为首的赞比亚共和国政府代表团，今天到达北京，对我国进行友好访问。中国人民热烈欢迎卡曼加副总统和赞比亚其他贵宾们的光临。
    赞比亚人民是英勇的人民。他们前赴后继，进行了近八十年反对殖民主义的顽强的斗争，终于在一九六四年取得了独立。他们既然能够赢得斗争的胜利，也就有决心维护胜利的成果。
    赞比亚人民是勤劳的人民。过去，赞比亚在英国殖民者的长期残酷的统治下，人民过着牛马不如的生活，富饶的国土，赤贫千里。今天，赞比亚人民正在用自己的双手建设祖国，发展民族经济和民族文化。我国人民对赞比亚独立后在各方面取得的成就，表示衷心的高兴。
    帝国主义和新老殖民主义千方百计地企图重新夺回它们在非洲的已经失掉了的阵地。因此，赞比亚人民仍然把反对帝国主义和殖民主义，当作自己头等重要的任务。赞比亚人民不仅在为维护本国的独立而斗争，并且积极支持津巴布韦人民和非洲其它国家人民反对殖民主义和种族主义的斗争。帝国主义的垂死挣扎，绝不能阻挡亚非人民反帝革命运动的主流。
    自从赞比亚独立以来，中赞两国在和平共处五项原则的基础上建立了良好的关系。中赞两国人民在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中，从来是相互支持的。我们相信，卡曼加副总统的这次访问，必将对进一步增进中赞两国的友好合作关系和加强中赞两国人民的友谊，作出积极的贡献。
