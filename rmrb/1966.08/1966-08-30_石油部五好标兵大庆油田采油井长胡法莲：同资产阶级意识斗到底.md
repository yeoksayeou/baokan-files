Chairman Mao has called on us workers to learn military affairs, politics, and culture, and this truly resonates with me.

Oil wells are drilled by people, and where there are people, there is struggle. Where there is struggle, there is politics. Participating in struggle requires learning politics. Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful ideological weapon of the proletariat. By mastering Mao Zedong Thought, we can combat various forms of bourgeois ideology and grow and develop through struggle.

Previously, some people looked down on us women, always thinking that we women were incapable of this or that. I thought: there is no distinction between men and women on the revolutionary path. We must fight against this old ideology that has persisted for thousands of years. Chairman Mao said, "The Chinese people have great aspirations." We must have the spirit of revolution.

I feel that I should fight against the "I" in my thoughts and establish the "public"; in my work, fight against the "fear" and establish the "dare"; in my style, fight against the "drag" and establish the "hard"; in my life, fight against the "enjoy" and establish the "hardship." Always keep in mind that we bear the responsibility of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution on our shoulders; always strive upward and always move forward.

    石油部五好标兵大庆油田采油井长胡法莲：
    同资产阶级意识斗到底
    毛主席号召我们工人兼学军事、政治、文化，真是说到我心里了。
    油井是人打的，有人就有斗争，有斗争就有政治，参加斗争就要学政治。毛泽东思想是无产阶级最强大的思想武器。我们掌握了毛泽东思想，才能和各种各样的资产阶级思想斗，在斗争中锻炼、成长。
    原先有人瞧不起我们妇女，总觉得我们女同志这也不行，那也不行。我就想：革命路上没有男女之分。要和几千年留下来的这种旧意识斗争到底。毛主席说：“中华儿女多奇志”，我们就是要有闹革命的奇志才行。
    我觉得自己应当在思想上斗倒“我”字，树立“公”字；在工作上斗倒“怕”字，树立“闯”字；在作风上斗倒“拖”字，树立“硬”字；在生活上斗倒“享”字，树立“苦”字。心里永远记着，我们肩上担负着中国革命和世界革命的重担；永远向上，永远前进。
