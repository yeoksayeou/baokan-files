The great leader Chairman Mao's historic meeting with revolutionary masses in the capital has brought immense inspiration to the revolutionary masses in the capital, pushing the revolutionary enthusiasm of people who have been celebrating the Party Central Committee's decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to a new high.

Today, countless groups of people marched towards the reception station of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, like countless rivers flowing into the sea. Countless congratulatory signs, letters of congratulations, and declarations of determination were gathered together. One after another, revolutionary masses representatives gave impassioned speeches in front of the loudspeaker. With thousands or even millions of people united in heart, thousands of words echoed with one voice: Dear leader Chairman Mao! It is you who have led the formulation of the great program for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is you who, in the meeting, have added boundless strength to the revolutionary masses. It is your sunlight that has illuminated the path of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We will definitely follow your teachings and resolutely carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

Upon hearing the news of Chairman Mao meeting the masses who came to report good news, many schools immediately rushed to the reception station at the location of the Central Committee to express their warm congratulations. Some teachers and students from Beijing Normal University wrote in their declaration: "After hearing the heart-stirring news that our beloved leader Chairman Mao has come to the reception station of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to receive revolutionary masses, we were so excited that our hearts were about to jump out of our chests. We couldn't help but shout: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live ten thousand times! Shouting a thousand times, shouting ten thousand times, we still cannot express our boundless love, boundless admiration, and boundless faith in Chairman Mao!" The revolutionary students of the third year of the Biology Department of Beijing Normal University brought the flowers they had cultivated themselves; they surrounded the portrait of Chairman Mao and came to the reception station. The leader of the Cultural Revolution Second Combat Group of this grade read the declaration on behalf of the revolutionary teachers and students, saying excitedly: "Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao meets the broad revolutionary masses. This is the greatest happiness for all revolutionary people in the country, and it is the greatest encouragement for us. Chairman Mao is always with us, and Chairman Mao's heart is tightly connected with ours. Dear Chairman Mao, we will definitely follow you and do revolution for life!"

The students of Beijing Girl's Fourth Middle School sang and danced excitedly, singing "Long Live Chairman Mao" over and over again; they danced the "Wishing Chairman Mao a Long Life" dance, dancing and dancing, the more they danced, the more enthusiastic they became. The revolutionary youngsters of Beijing Eleventh Middle School expressed that they would definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words, care about state affairs, and be brave pioneers of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The Party Central Committee's decision pointed out: "A large number of originally unknown revolutionary young people have become brave pioneers." The revolutionary young people in the capital have strongly responded to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's cherishing of the revolutionary enthusiasm of young people. More than a thousand revolutionary young people from Beijing First Girls' Middle School sincerely expressed their extremely excited feelings to the most beloved Party Central Committee and the most beloved Chairman Mao. They said, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao understand us young people the most, trust us young people the most, and encourage us to take the political stage and do revolution to turn the world upside down. We are determined to strive to be lifelong revolutionary pioneers of the proletariat. Chairman Mao once said to us young people: "The world is yours, it is also ours, but in the final analysis, it is yours." Chairman Mao's great teaching is to let us smash the old world to pieces and build a brand new communist world. We will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly smash all old educational systems, break through all the frameworks of bourgeois intellectuals ruling the schools, and build a new proletarian school in the style of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University. We will not only study literature but also study industry, agriculture, and the military, and actively participate in the criticism of the bourgeois cultural revolution. We are determined to temper ourselves into red successors of the proletariat in the great storms of class struggle. Many Young Pioneers from Laowanqian Primary School in Xuanwu District have already come once. After hearing the good news of Chairman Mao meeting the masses who came to report good news, they came again with other Young Pioneers, holding the red-shining "Quotations from Chairman Mao," carrying the portrait of Chairman Mao, beating drums and gongs, and came to the reception station of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, shouting and singing enthusiastically to express their love for the Party and Chairman Mao. Three Young Pioneers wearing red scarves happily told the reporter, "We saw the decision made under the personal chairmanship of Chairman Mao by the Party Central Committee, and our hearts were especially, especially happy. We are willing to be brave revolutionary pioneers!"

The revolutionary workers of Beijing Garment Factory No. 2, upon hearing this good news today, many people burst into tears, and could not help but shout: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!" They had come to the reception station to report good news the day after the Party Central Committee issued the decision. Today, after getting off work, they immediately prepared and brought the good news again to the reception station, expressing their determination to definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words, care about state affairs, and carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

"For the cause of revolution, we dare to climb the knife mountain and descend the fire sea." The declaration read by the worker representative of Beijing Taoranting High Voltage Electrical Appliance Factory expressed the heroic spirit of the capital's workers to resolutely implement and bravely defend the decision of the Party Central Committee. They said: The decision of the Party Central Committee is a spiritual atomic bomb with tremendous power, greatly boosting the morale of revolutionaries and greatly suppressing the arrogance of ghosts and snakes. We will definitely listen to the words of the Party Central Committee and definitely carry out this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. An old worker with 40 years of work experience in the Printing Factory of the Ministry of Railways, Cui Shiqian, said, during the anti-rightist struggle in 1957, he listened to the Party's words and took the lead. This time, the cultural revolution, he must listen to the Party's words and fight against all anti-Party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought ghosts and snakes. He had not beaten the drum for many years, but this time he personally beat the drum on the way, eagerly coming to express his determination to the Party Central Committee. Workers from the Bridge Factory in Fengtai, more than 50 miles away, also sent representatives today to deliver declarations.

Some people's communes and production teams in the suburbs also selected outstanding community representatives to come from far away to express their wishes to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. They said, Chairman Mao, in his busy schedule, met with revolutionary masses in the capital, which is a great concern and encouragement for us. We poor and lower-middle peasants firmly support the wise decision of the Party Central Committee and resolutely listen to Chairman Mao's words, playing a pivotal role in this cultural revolution. The representative of the South Garden People's Commune Fenzhong Temple Brigade held up the quotation boards of Chairman Mao and kept shouting in front of the reception station: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!" The representatives sent by the Party members, League members, and poor and lower-middle peasants of Huangtugang People's Commune said: The wise decision of the Party Central Committee is shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, greatly boosting the morale of revolutionary masses and greatly suppressing the arrogance of all ghosts and snakes. The representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants of the duck farm of Jinxing Brigade of Hongxing People's Commune promised to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao: We will definitely hold a hoe in one hand and a pen in the other, and give a fierce blow to those ghosts and snakes who walk the capitalist road, are anti-Party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought.

Today, the reception station of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was crowded with people, and the sound of drums and cheers continued until late at night.

After the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was published, revolutionary teachers and students in the capital came to the location of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in an unbroken stream to send good news and declarations to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. This is a group of revolutionary teachers and students surrounding the reception station to send good news.

On the evening of August 10, 42 community members from Dahuangmen People's Commune in Fengtai District of Beijing reported good news to the Party Central Committee and saw the great leader Chairman Mao. On August 11, all community members wrote a letter to Chairman Mao in high spirits, promising to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. This is them enthusiastically passing the letter to Chairman Mao at the community meeting.
