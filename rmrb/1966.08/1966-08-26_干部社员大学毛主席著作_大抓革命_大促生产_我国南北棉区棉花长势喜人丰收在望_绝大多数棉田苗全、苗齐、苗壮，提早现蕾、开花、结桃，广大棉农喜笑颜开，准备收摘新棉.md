Cadres and community members across the country are deeply studying Chairman Mao's works, focusing on revolution, and promoting production. The cotton fields in both northern and southern regions are thriving, and a bumper harvest is in sight. The vast majority of cotton fields have full, uniform, and robust seedlings, with early budding, flowering, and fruiting. The broad masses of cotton farmers are delighted and preparing to harvest the new cotton.

A report from Xinhua News Agency on August 25 states that cadres and community members in the cotton-producing regions are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, focusing on revolution, and promoting production, creating a thriving scene of dual victories in revolution and production. Currently, cadres and community members across the cotton regions are filled with unprecedented revolutionary enthusiasm. Most cotton regions have better cotton growth compared to last year, and a bumper harvest is highly likely. The broad masses of community members in the cotton regions are following Chairman Mao's teaching of "Being humble makes one progress, while being arrogant makes one fall behind," continuing to strive and further strengthen late-stage field management, making every effort to achieve a bumper cotton harvest.

This year, cadres and community members in various cotton-producing regions have further deepened their study and application of Chairman Mao's works during the socialist education movement, with revolutionary enthusiasm soaring. They enthusiastically responded to the Party and the state's call for a dual bumper harvest of grain and cotton, fully embodying the spirit of "farming for the revolution," and using every means to plant more and better cotton to support the socialist revolution and construction. According to materials provided by relevant departments, the completion of the state's cotton planting plan this year is generally good. In the northern cotton regions, provinces like Shandong, Hebei, and Henan, which have large cotton planting areas, have chosen fields with better soil and water conditions to plant cotton. In the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, provinces like Hunan, Anhui, and Jiangxi have expanded their cotton planting areas this year. At the same time, the planting area of high-quality cotton seeds in various cotton regions has significantly increased compared to last year. The level of fertilizer application has improved, and the technique of reasonable planting density is widely valued. Sowing and seedling management methods have also seen significant improvements. Therefore, the area of "one-time sowing, full seedling" in both northern and southern cotton regions has significantly expanded compared to previous years. The vast majority of cotton fields have full, uniform, and robust seedlings, with early budding, flowering, and fruiting. Currently, from south to north, the cotton is thriving, and the broad masses of community members are delighted and preparing to harvest the new cotton.

The new leap in China's cotton production is the result of cadres and community members in the cotton regions arming themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, continuously revolutionizing their thinking. Many cadres and community members place Chairman Mao's quotations in the fields and carry his works with them, studying and applying them whenever they encounter difficulties or problems, thus solving many difficulties and problems in cotton production in a timely manner.

This year, the northern cotton regions encountered widespread spring drought during the sowing season, and many southern cotton regions suffered from drought after sowing. Pest infestations were also widespread and severe, and some places experienced hailstorms. Faced with the difficulties brought by natural disasters, the broad masses of cadres and community members repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's essays such as "On the Rectification of Work Style," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "Cast Away Illusions, Prepare for Struggle," greatly enhancing their courage and confidence to overcome natural disasters. After studying Chairman Mao's works, cadres and community members in Henan Province resolutely followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "Resolutely deciding to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory," fighting the drought with great enthusiasm and creating many methods such as "multiple wells converging" and "long-distance water transport," ultimately overcoming the drought and ensuring the normal growth of cotton. Shandong Province, which has the largest cotton planting area, experienced a prolonged and severe drought this year. The broad masses of community members, following Chairman Mao's teachings, fought tenaciously against the drought with the spirit of "Moving Mountains." Before sowing, they carried out large-scale agricultural water conservancy construction centered on well-digging, and many cotton fields underwent drought-resistant sowing. After sowing, they repeatedly checked and supplemented seedlings, actively expanding drought-resistant water sources, ultimately ensuring that the vast majority of cotton fields achieved full seedlings.

Last year, Hubei Province, which had the highest total cotton production in the country, Zhejiang Province and the suburbs of Shanghai, where the average yield of lint cotton per acre exceeded 100 pounds, as well as the broad masses of cotton regions in Jiangsu, Hebei, and Liaoning, which achieved large-scale and significant increases in production, have, through more extensive and in-depth study of Chairman Mao's works, followed Chairman Mao's teachings, used the "two-line struggle" approach to comprehensively summarize last year's experiences, analyzed the favorable and unfavorable factors this year, making their direction of advancement clearer and their spirit more vigorous. Therefore, this year's cotton production has shown a gratifying trend of "reaching new heights."

This year, the excellent situation in cotton production is closely linked to the further launch of the "learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, help the backward, and surpass" movement in various cotton regions. Whether in the south or the north, more regions have adopted the effective method of "inviting in and sending out" to spread advanced experiences. In many cotton regions of Anhui, Henan, Shaanxi, and Shandong, and seven other provinces, more than 13,000 cotton planting technicians were invited from other provinces and advanced cotton planting units within the province; Hubei, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and other provinces, in response to invitations from other places, sent more cotton planting technicians to various places to teach cotton planting techniques than last year. These technicians, together with local cadres and community members, study Chairman Mao's works, plant demonstration fields, not only teach their advanced experiences but also learn local advanced technologies, promoting the exchange of advanced experiences and technologies, and playing a good role in promoting cotton production.

    干部社员大学毛主席著作　大抓革命　大促生产
    我国南北棉区棉花长势喜人丰收在望
    绝大多数棉田苗全、苗齐、苗壮，提早现蕾、开花、结桃，广大棉农喜笑颜开，准备收摘新棉
    新华社二十五日讯　我国棉区广大干部和社员高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大抓革命，大促生产，使棉区处处呈现出革命、生产双胜利的喜人形势。目前，广大干部和社员革命热情空前高涨，大部分棉区棉花长势比去年好，丰收大有希望。广大棉区社员正按照毛主席“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，再接再厉，进一步加强后期田间管理，尽最大努力夺取棉花的丰收。
    今年，各产棉区的干部和社员，在深入开展的社会主义教育运动中，进一步活学活用毛主席著作，革命热情极其高涨。他们热烈响应党和国家提出的粮棉双丰收的号召，高度发扬“为革命种田”的精神，千方百计多种棉、种好棉，支援社会主义革命和社会主义建设。据有关部门提供的材料表明，各地今年完成国家植棉计划的情况都比较好。北方棉区植棉面积比较大的山东、河北、河南等省，今年都选择土质和水利条件较好的农田种棉，长江中下游的湖南、安徽、江西等棉区，今年植棉面积还有所扩大。同时，各棉区的良种棉花种植面积也比去年有很大的增长。施肥水平有新的提高，合理密植技术普遍受到重视，播种和苗期管理方法都有较大的改进。因此，南北棉区“一次播种保全苗”的面积都比往年显著扩大，绝大多数棉田苗全、苗齐、苗壮，提早现蕾、开花、结桃。目前，从南到北，棉花长势喜人，广大社员正喜笑颜开地准备收摘新棉。
    我国棉花生产出现的新的跃进形势，是广大棉区社员和干部用毛泽东思想武装头脑，促使思想不断革命化的结果。许多干部和社员把毛主席语录牌插在田间，把毛主席著作带在身边，遇到困难和问题马上就学，学了马上就用，使棉花生产中的许多困难和问题得到及时解决。
    今年，北方棉区在播种时节，普遍遇到春旱，南方不少棉区在播种之后遭到干旱，虫害也比较普遍而严重，还有些地方发生了雹灾。在自然灾害带来的困难面前，广大社员和干部反复学习了毛主席的《愚公移山》、《为人民服务》、《丢掉幻想，准备斗争》等文章，大大增强了战胜自然灾害的勇气和信心。河南省的干部和社员学习了毛主席著作之后，坚决按照毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，意气风发地奋战干旱，创造出“多井汇流”和“远途运水”等许多办法，终于战胜了干旱，保证了棉花的正常生长。植棉面积最大的山东省，今年遭到长期持续干旱，广大社员按照毛主席的教导，用愚公移山的精神同干旱展开顽强的斗争。他们在播种前进行了大规模的以打井为中心的农田水利建设，许多棉田进行了抗旱播种，播种以后又反复查苗补苗，积极扩大抗旱水源，终于使绝大部分棉田基本达到全苗。
    去年棉花总产量在全国居第一位的湖北省，皮棉平均亩产量已超过百斤的浙江省和上海市郊区，以及去年创造大面积、大幅度增产的江苏、河北和辽宁等省的广大棉区社员和干部，经过更加广泛和深入地学习毛主席著作，按照毛主席的教导，用“一分为二”的观点全面地总结了去年的经验，分析了今年的有利和不利因素，使前进的方向更加明确，干劲也更加充沛。因此，今年的棉花生产都出现了“更上一层楼”的可喜形势。
    今年，棉花生产的大好形势，同各棉区进一步掀起以学先进、赶先进为中心的比学赶帮超运动也是密切地联系着的。无论是南方还是北方，都有更多地区推行了“请进来、派出去”这一传播先进经验的好方法。安徽、河南、陕西、山东等七个省的很多棉区，从外省和本省先进植棉单位请进来的植棉技术能手即达一万三千多人；湖北、浙江、江苏等省应外地邀请，派往各地传授植棉经验的植棉能手，都比去年有很大的增加。这些技术能手同当地干部、社员一道学习毛主席著作，一道种样板田，既传授自己的先进经验，又学习当地的先进技术，促使先进经验和技术大交流，对促进棉花生产起了良好的推动作用。
