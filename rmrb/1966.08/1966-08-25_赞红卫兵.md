In Praise of the Red Guards

The Red Guards' hearts are with the Party,
Revolutionary passion soars to the heavens,
Workers, peasants, and soldiers cheer together,
Firmly supporting the young pioneers.

The Red Guards' hearts are with the Party,
Armed with Mao Zedong Thought,
Their hearts are the reddest, their eyes the brightest,
Setting a fine example of breaking the old and establishing the new.

The Red Guards' hearts are with the Party,
Holding high the red flag, charging forward,
With iron brooms in hand,
Sweeping away all monsters and demons!

The Red Guards' hearts are with the Party,
Their fighting spirit surges like waves,
They dare to rebel, dare to act, dare to make revolution,
Changing minds, changing the world.

The Red Guards' thoughts are red,
Revolutionary spirit soars like a rainbow,
Carrying the banner of revolution on their shoulders,
Forever following the great leader Mao Zedong!

  解放军某部　继英　周森　志毅　振江
  红卫兵心向党，
  革命激情高万丈，
  工农兵齐欢呼，
  坚决支持小闯将。
  红卫兵心向党，
  毛泽东思想来武装，
  心最红，眼最亮，
  破旧立新好榜样。
  红卫兵心向党，
  高举红旗奔前方，
  双手举起铁扫帚，
  牛鬼蛇神一扫光！
  红卫兵心向党，
  汹涌澎湃斗志昂，
  要闯、要干、要造反，
  人换思想地换装。
  红卫兵思想红，
  革命志气贯长虹，
  革命大旗肩上扛，
  永远紧跟伟大统帅毛泽东！
