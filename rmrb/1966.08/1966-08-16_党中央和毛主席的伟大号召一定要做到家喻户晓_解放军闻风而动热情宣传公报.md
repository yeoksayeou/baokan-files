The great call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao must be made known to every household. The PLA responds enthusiastically to propagate the communiqué.

Xinhua News Agency, August 15th: In recent days, the People's Liberation Army has dispatched propaganda teams and groups to remote mountain villages and islands, enthusiastically propagating the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee to the masses. While studying the communiqué seriously themselves, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers are actively carrying out propaganda activities, determined to quickly spread the great call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to the people in various places.

In the southwestern border region, whether in the mountain villages of the Jingpo, Buliang, and Wa ethnic groups, or in the villages of the Dai, Miao, and Hani ethnic groups, one can see the officers and soldiers of the Kunming troops of the PLA propagating the communiqué of the Party Central Committee to the people. The soldiers of a certain regiment of the Southern Yunnan garrison, after listening to the broadcast on the afternoon of the 13th, immediately carried a giant portrait of Chairman Mao and a plaque with Chairman Mao's quotations, beating drums and gongs to the nearby agricultural communes to propagate. On the morning of the 14th, they organized a propaganda team of more than 150 people to go to more distant places to propagate to the people of various ethnic groups. A certain unit stationed in Xishuangbanna dispatched more than 80 officers and soldiers from the Dai, Hani, Zhuang, and Miao ethnic groups to propagate the communiqué to the villages of ethnic brothers on the border. The propaganda team dispatched by a certain unit stationed in the Awa Mountains helped the Wa people with labor while propagating the spirit of the communiqué, and was warmly welcomed by the Wa people. The propaganda teams dispatched by the Western Yunnan garrison yesterday carried radios to the villages of the Jingpo and Dai ethnic groups, listening to broadcasts and discussing with the ethnic brothers. The Dai people of Guangdou Village said in a discussion that Chairman Mao's sunlight has reached the hearts of the border people. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, generation after generation reading Chairman Mao's books, and following the Communist Party forever, building the border into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The officers and soldiers of the Navy, Air Force, and the Chengdu, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Lanzhou, Beijing, Nanjing, Shenyang, Wuhan, and Inner Mongolia units, after listening to the broadcast in the evening of the 13th, immediately organized propaganda teams. Some went to remote mountain areas and fishing villages, some to towns, and some to villages where ethnic minorities live, widely carrying out propaganda activities, quickly spreading the good news to the broad masses, making it known to every household and known to all.

The officers and soldiers of many units of the Guangzhou troops, when setting out to propagate, encountered heavy rain. The soldiers said, "Heavy rain cannot stop our determination to spread the voice of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao!" Many cultural workers of various units, with excited hearts, quickly compiled artistic performances to celebrate the communiqué, using art as a weapon to propagate the communiqué to the officers and soldiers and the people in the surrounding areas. The cultural workers of the Beijing garrison brought their newly compiled performances to Tiananmen Square and Beijing Railway Station. The naval cultural work team of the Guangzhou troops, after listening to the broadcast in the evening of the 13th, performed the celebration of the communiqué on stage at 7:30 PM. Both on stage and off stage, they shouted, "Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live Chairman Mao!" The members of the cultural troupe of a certain unit of the Jinan troops, after listening to the broadcast on the evening of the 13th, unanimously said, "We are the propaganda team of Mao Zedong Thought and must tell the people on the island about the great communiqué of the Party Central Committee tonight." They immediately took action, compiled seven performances including the song and dance "Praising the Communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee," beating drums and gongs, holding high red flags, carrying the giant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao and slogan boards, surging onto the streets to carry out propaganda activities. The island's military and civilian population were excited, singing and shouting in unison, warmly supporting the communiqué of the Party Central Committee. The island was immersed in a sea of excitement and joy late at night.
