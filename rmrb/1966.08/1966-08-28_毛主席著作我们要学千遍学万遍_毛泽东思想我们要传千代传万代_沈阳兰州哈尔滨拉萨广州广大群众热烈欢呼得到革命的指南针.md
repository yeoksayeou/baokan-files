We must study Chairman Mao's works ten thousand times, pass on Mao Zedong Thought to ten thousand generations. The masses in Shenyang, Lanzhou, Harbin, Lhasa, and Guangzhou enthusiastically welcome the acquisition of the revolutionary compass.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 27th: Shenyang City has already seen 340,000 workers, revolutionary intellectuals, revolutionary cadres, street residents, and suburban farmers eagerly purchase "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

In the early hours of August 24th, the news of the delivery of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to various branches of the Shenyang Xinhua Bookstore was spread by people engaged in propaganda activities for the destruction of the "Four Olds" and the establishment of the "Four News." They rushed to the branches hoping to buy them immediately. The revolutionary staff of the bookstore began selling them at midnight.

The 40,000 copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" sent to 140 supply and marketing cooperatives in the suburbs were quickly purchased by the members.

Nearly 100,000 revolutionary teachers and students from various colleges and universities in Shenyang have received "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" or "Quotations from Chairman Mao" since August 16th. They said: Chairman Mao's books are the treasures of the revolution, and revolutionary people cannot do without them. Some revolutionary teachers and students, holding "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and swore: They would definitely engrave Chairman Mao's words deeply in their hearts and put them into action at all times.

Lanzhou
According to Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, August 27th: The Lanzhou Xinhua Bookstore sold various editions of Chairman Mao's works totaling more than 150,000 copies to the revolutionary masses and seven colleges and universities on August 25th and 26th. People rejoiced upon receiving the precious books and enthusiastically cheered, "Long live our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!"

In these days, the various branches of the Lanzhou Xinhua Bookstore were decorated like during a festival. The branch on "Revolution Road" in the city center had a large portrait of Chairman Mao hanging above the door, with couplets on both sides reading: "We will study Chairman Mao's works a hundred times, a thousand times, ten thousand times, and learn from them generation after generation; We will hold high Mao Zedong Thought for a hundred years, a thousand years, ten thousand years, and pass it down generation after generation." When the bookstore's doors opened at dawn, the crowd waiting outside immediately cheered, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live forever!"

The revolutionary staff of the Xinhua Bookstore also organized a float and a lion dance team, beating drums and gongs to distribute Chairman Mao's works to seven colleges and universities.

Harbin
According to Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, August 25th: The relevant departments in Harbin City sent the newly published "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and "Quotations from Chairman Mao" directly to rural people's communes and schools in the past two days. The revolutionary masses were overjoyed. The slogan "Long live Chairman Mao!" echoed along the banks of the Songhua River.

More than 1,500 poor and lower-middle peasants from the Wanggang People's Commune in Binjiang District held a meeting to distribute Chairman Mao's works. They sang "The East Is Red" and "The Ship Sails on the Sea," celebrating the party sending them the most powerful ideological weapon—Chairman Mao's books. The Black Dragon River University held a solemn ceremony to receive "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Xu Guang, a student from the Foreign Languages Department, representing her fellow students, received the book and said excitedly: Following Chairman Mao's words means reading Chairman Mao's books. I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions, care about national affairs, and swear to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end.

Lhasa
According to Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, August 25th: On August 25th, the Lhasa Xinhua Bookstore began supplying various editions of Chairman Mao's works to the revolutionary masses of the Tibetan and Han ethnic groups in large quantities. The revolutionary masses beat drums and gongs, carried Chairman Mao's portrait, held up big joyous posters, and sang revolutionary songs to congratulate the bookstore. The responsible comrades of the Secretariat of the CPC Tibet Autonomous Region Committee also went to the bookstore to distribute Chairman Mao's works.

The broad Tibetan masses cheered, "Mao Zedong Thought is the red sun shining on the snowy mountains. With it, the million liberated farmers in Tibet are blessed." To buy "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" first, many people traveled from dozens of miles away to queue up. Many people jumped for joy after buying Chairman Mao's works, shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Some Tibetan students from Lhasa Middle School, after receiving the new books, vowed: They would definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions, become daring revolutionaries, sweep away all ghosts and monsters on the "Roof of the World," and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!

Guangzhou
According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 25th: In these days, the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China sent 59,000 copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to more than 200 half-work-half-study middle schools, full-time middle schools, private middle schools, and night middle schools in urban and suburban areas of two counties.

Students from the Guangzhou First Agricultural School, who were working in the fields, heard that the party had sent them the precious books. Many of them, with their legs covered in mud, did not even bother to wash, rushed back to school. When the students received "Quotations from Chairman Mao," the applause, cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao," and high-pitched revolutionary songs echoed for more than three hours.
