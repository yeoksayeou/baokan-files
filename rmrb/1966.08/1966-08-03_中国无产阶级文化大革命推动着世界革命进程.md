Various international opinions point out: Mao Zedong Thought ensures China will never change color

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China advances the world revolution

To build socialism, it is necessary to transform people's old ideas and sweep away all remnants of the old era

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Tirana, Comrade Dejana, a member of the Central Committee of the Party of Labor of Albania and the Minister of Education and Culture, enthusiastically praised the socialist cultural revolution in China and hailed the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

Dejana said: "The great cultural revolution that is being carried out in heroic China with an unprecedented momentum is a brilliant victory for the heroic Communist Party of China. This revolution will further advance the socialist revolution, ensure the eternal existence of socialism and communism in China from generation to generation, and make it impossible for revisionism to find any loophole in the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people."

He said: "We warmly hail all your victories in this regard in the past, present, and future, and sincerely wish the great China with a population of 700 million to forever hold high the banner of revolution, the banner of Marxism-Leninism, and the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought."

He said that in China and Albania, proletarian culture has become a powerful material force, effectively serving socialist construction and the revolutionary education of workers, peasants, soldiers, and other broad masses of laborers. He pointed out that in this regard, the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong and the measures taken by the Communist Party of China are a very valuable treasure trove.

Dejana made these remarks while recently seeing off the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe from China.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Rangoon, Myanmar writer Deqin Miaodan recently told a Xinhua News Agency reporter here, "Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon of contemporary Marxism-Leninism; just as Mao Zedong Thought has made every revolutionary struggle in China victorious, I am deeply convinced that Mao Zedong Thought will once again ensure the victory of today's socialist cultural revolution."

He said: "The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought is increasing, while the ideology of revisionism is deteriorating day by day. Mao Zedong's prestige among the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America is increasing, while the reputation of the revisionists has been tarnished. This is because revisionism undermines the anti-imperialist movement, while Mao Zedong Thought provides clear guidance for the anti-imperialist movement. China is firmly at the forefront of the anti-imperialist struggle. Undoubtedly, based on the actual situation of current developments, revisionism is doomed to fail."

He emphasized: "But revisionism will not fail automatically. Only by fighting it with genuine Marxist-Leninist thought can it be defeated. Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon of contemporary Marxism-Leninism."

When talking about the socialist cultural revolution currently unfolding in China, he said: "The socialist cultural revolution now underway in China is a revolution that concerns the entire progressive humanity, it is the most significant and greatest event since China's liberation."

He went on to say: "This socialist cultural revolution is not only important for China but also for the whole world."

He said: "Only when the socialist cultural revolution achieves victory can China's socialist system be consolidated, and the driving force of the socialist revolution be further enhanced. The people's movements for liberation, peace, and socialism in Asia, Africa, and Latin America will gain strength as China's socialism is consolidated and the driving force of China's socialist revolution is enhanced."

He said: "I believe that this revolution will be victorious because the people are using Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon in this revolution."

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Tokyo on August 28, Chairman Baishi Fan of the Japan Liaison Committee of the Afro-Asian Writers' Conference spoke to Chinese reporters in Tokyo, enthusiastically praising Mao Zedong Thought and commending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

Baishi had led a Japanese writers' delegation to attend the recent emergency conference of Afro-Asian writers in Beijing.

Baishi said: "From this emergency conference of Afro-Asian writers, it can be seen that the people of Asia and Africa strongly express their desire to advance along the path indicated by Mao Zedong." Baishi said: Chairman Mao's famous poem, "The seas churn with clouds and waves in fury, the continents shake with thunder and lightning," highly summarizes the current situation in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. He said: "These two lines of poetry point out to us that our struggle is correct, how we should struggle in the future, and at the same time give us confidence." Baishi excitedly recounted to the reporter the scene of Chairman Mao receiving the delegates attending the emergency conference of Afro-Asian writers. He said: This was his third time seeing Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao, as before, was "very healthy and stepped briskly," which made him very happy. He said that conveying the good news of Chairman Mao's health to the peoples of the world is a meaningful thing.

Baishi believes that today, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution being carried out by the Chinese people is absolutely necessary for building a socialist country. He said: "To build socialism, it is necessary to transform people's old ideas and sweep away all remnants of the old era. Otherwise, socialism cannot be built, and society may regress." He said: "For this reason, intellectuals who have come from the old society must not only serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers but must also learn from the workers, peasants, and soldiers and unite with them."

Baishi said that in order not to repeat the mistakes of modern revisionism in the Soviet Union, China is conducting revolutionary education for the younger generation, which is very important. He said that at present in China, a large number of young people with a communist style, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have emerged from the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Baishi also praised the mass swimming movement that has been launched in China under the call and advocacy of Chairman Mao Zedong. He said that during his visit to China, he observed a swimming meeting with five thousand participants in Wuhan on the Yangtze River. He said that the mass swimming movement launched in China not only has military significance in opposing American imperialist aggression but also "tempered the strong will needed by the Chinese people to build socialism."

According to a Xinhua News Agency report, a recent article in the Singaporean publication "People's Forum" pointed out that the socialist cultural revolution currently underway in the great socialist China with a population of 700 million "not only deals a crushing blow to the demons and snakes on Chinese soil and anti-socialist elements, but will also have an extremely profound impact on the present and future of the world."

The article said that in this cultural revolution, the Chinese people have exposed the anti-socialist faces of those bourgeois representatives, careerists, and conspirators who have infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, stripped them of their "official" status, and seized their power, which is a great thing. All revolutionary people around the world are thrilled and excited about this.

The article said: "China, as the center of the world revolution, whether it can consolidate, develop, and strengthen itself, whether it can always maintain a revolutionary stance and never change color, this question has extremely important world significance and historical significance. This is a major issue that affects the process of the world revolution, a major issue that affects the face of the world, and a major issue that affects the balance of class struggle on an international scale. If China can effectively prevent the restoration of capitalism, can thoroughly uproot the roots of revisionism, and can always maintain a revolutionary stance and never change color, this will maintain and strengthen the good situation of 'the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind,' which is extremely unfavorable to imperialism—especially American imperialism—and to the reactionaries of various countries."

The article pointed out: "It is no surprise that imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries are extremely alarmed and hateful of China's cultural revolution. After all, these gentlemen have placed their hopes for the restoration of capitalism in China on those hidden bourgeois representatives, on the next generation of China. Now, these bourgeois representatives, 'scholars,' and 'authorities' are one by one being exposed and overthrown, while China's next generation is becoming revolutionary and outstanding successors one by one. How can this not alarm, despair, and infuriate the gentlemen of imperialism?"

    各国舆论指出：毛泽东思想保证中国永不变色
    中国无产阶级文化大革命推动着世界革命进程
    要建设社会主义就必须改造人的旧思想和涤荡一切旧时代的遗物
    据新华社地拉那电阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员、教育和文化部长德雅纳热烈赞扬中国社会主义文化大革命，欢呼毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    德雅纳说：“伟大的中国正在以史无前例的气势进行的文化大革命，是英雄的中国共产党的一个辉煌胜利。这场革命将使社会主义革命进一步推向前进，保证社会主义和共产主义在中国世世代代地存在下去，使修正主义在中国共产党和中国人民当中永远钻不了一点空子”。他说：“我们热烈欢呼你们在这方面过去、现在和将来取得的一切胜利，并且衷心地祝愿拥有七亿人口的伟大的中国永远高举革命的旗帜、马克思列宁主义的旗帜和毛泽东思想的红旗”。
    他说，在中国和阿尔巴尼亚，无产阶级文化已经变成了一种强大的物质力量，它正在有效地为社会主义建设服务，为对工农兵和其他广大劳动群众进行革命教育服务。他指出，在这方面，毛泽东同志的学说和中国共产党所采取的措施，是非常有价值的宝库。
    德雅纳是在最近欢送中国北京歌舞团时说这番话的。
    据新华社仰光电　缅甸作家德钦妙丹最近在这里对新华社记者说，“毛泽东思想是当代的马克思列宁主义灯塔”；“正如毛泽东思想已使中国的每一个革命斗争取得胜利一样，我深信，毛泽东思想一定会再一次保证今天的社会主义文化大革命取得胜利。”
    他说：“毛泽东思想的光辉越来越明亮，而修正主义意识形态则日益衰败。毛泽东在亚非拉各国人民中间的威望越来越高，而修正主义者则已经声名狼藉。这是因为修正主义破坏反帝运动，而毛泽东思想则给予反帝运动以明确的指导，中国坚定地走在反帝斗争的最前列。”“毫无疑问，根据目前事态发展的实际情况，修正主义是注定要完蛋的。”
    他强调说：“但是修正主义是不会自动失败的。只有用真正的马克思列宁主义思想同它进行斗争，才能把它打败。毛泽东思想是当代的马克思列宁主义灯塔。”
    他在谈到正在中国展开的文化大革命时说：“现在在中国展开的社会主义文化大革命是关系到整个进步人类的一场革命”，“是中国解放以后意义最重大的最伟大的事件。”
    他接着说：“这个社会主义文化大革命不但对中国而且对全世界都是重要的。”
    他说，“只有社会主义文化革命取得了胜利，中国的社会主义制度才能巩固，社会主义革命的动力才能进一步增强。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲争取解放、和平和社会主义的人民运动，将随着中国社会主义的巩固和中国社会主义革命动力的增强而增加力量。”
    他说，“我相信，这场革命一定会胜利，因为人民在这场革命中用毛泽东思想作为武器。”
    据新华社东京二十八日电　亚非作家会议日本联络委员会主席白石凡在东京向中国记者发表谈话，热情歌颂毛泽东思想，赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命。
    白石曾率领日本作家代表团出席最近在北京举行的亚非作家紧急会议。
    白石说：“从这次亚非作家紧急会议看出，亚洲和非洲的人们强烈地表示要沿着毛泽东所指示的方向前进。”白石说：毛主席的著名诗句“四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激”，高度地概括了当代亚、非、拉的形势。他说：“这两句诗向我们指出了我们的斗争道路是正确的，我们今后应当怎样斗争，同时给了我们以信心。”白石兴奋地向记者讲述毛主席接见出席亚非作家紧急会议的代表的情景。他说：这是他第三次见到毛主席。毛主席同过去一样“非常健康，步履矫健”，这使他非常高兴。他说，把毛主席健康的喜讯传达给世界各国人民是一件有意义的事。
    白石认为今天中国人民在毛泽东思想指引下所进行的无产阶级文化大革命，对于建设社会主义国家是绝对需要的。他说：“要建设社会主义就必须改造人的旧思想，必须涤荡一切旧时代留下来的遗物。否则就不能建设社会主义，就有可能使社会倒退。”他说：“正因为如此，从旧社会走过来的知识分子，不仅要为工农兵服务，还必须向工农兵学习和同工农兵结合。”
    白石说，中国为了不重蹈苏联现代修正主义的覆辙，正在向年青的一代进行革命教育，这一点是非常重要的。他说，目前在中国，从工农兵群众中涌现了大批用毛泽东思想武装起来的、具有共产主义风格的年青人。
    白石还赞扬在毛泽东主席号召和提倡下在中国展开的群众性的游泳运动。他说，他在访问中国期间在武汉长江参观了有五千人参加的游泳大会。他说，中国所展开的群众性的游泳运动既有反对美帝国主义侵略的军事意义，同时又“锻炼了中国人民建设社会主义所必需的坚强意志”。
    据新华社讯　新加坡消息：新加坡《人民论坛》最近发表文章指出，目前在拥有七亿人口的、伟大的社会主义中国进行的社会主义文化大革命，“不仅给予中国土地上的牛鬼蛇神和反社会主义分子以歼灭性的打击，对于世界的现在和未来，都将产生无比深远的影响”。
    文章说，在这场文化大革命中，中国人民把那些钻进革命队伍里的资产阶级代表人物、野心家和阴谋家一个个揪了出来，使他们的反社会主义面目暴露在光天化日之下，罢了他们的“官”，夺了他们的权，这是一件大好事，全世界革命人民都为这件事而感到欢欣鼓舞。
    文章说：“中国，作为世界革命的中心，它是不是能巩固、发展和强大，是不是能始终坚持革命的立场、永远不改变颜色，这个问题，具有无比重大的世界意义和历史意义。这是影响世界革命进程的大问题，是影响世界面貌的大问题，是影响国际范围内的阶级斗争的力量对比的大问题。中国能够有效地防止资本主义复辟，能够彻底挖掉修正主义的根子，能够永远坚持革命立场、不改变颜色，这就能保持并加强‘东风压倒西风’的大好形势，对帝国主义——特别是美帝国主义——和各国反动派显然是极端不利的。”
    文章指出：“帝国主义和各国反动派对中国文化大革命感到无比惊慌和痛恨，这是预料中的事。试想，这些老爷们把在中国复辟资本主义的希望，寄托在那些隐藏起来的资产阶级代表人物身上，寄托在中国的下一代身上，现在，这些资产阶级代表人物、‘学者’、‘权威’一个个被揪出来，一个个被打倒，而中国的下一代，眼看一个个成为革命的优秀坚强的接班人，这一切，怎能叫帝国主义的老爷们不惊慌，不绝望，不痛恨呢？”
