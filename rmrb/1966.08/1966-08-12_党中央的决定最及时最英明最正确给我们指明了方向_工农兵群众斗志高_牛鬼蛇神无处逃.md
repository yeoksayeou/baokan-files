The Party Central Committee's decision is the timeliest, wisest, and most correct, pointing the way forward. The workers, peasants, and soldiers are full of fighting spirit, and the ghosts and monsters have nowhere to hide.

The people of East China, Central China, and Southwest China have expressed their determination to be bold and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 11th: After the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was transmitted to the East China region, including Jiangsu, Shandong, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Fujian, it greatly encouraged the revolutionary masses who are actively participating in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The revolutionary teachers and students of Nanjing University, who are bravely fighting against the anti-party and anti-socialist black gang led by Kuang Yaming, listened to the broadcast twice or three times on the evening of the 8th. The campus was filled with joy. That night, the students posted more than 200 large red bulletins. Some revolutionary teachers and students from the Foreign Languages Department wrote in the bulletins: The Party Central Committee's decision is extremely timely, wise, and correct. It is comprehensive and illuminates the path of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We will definitely take the Party Central Committee's decision as our guiding principle, forever follow the Party Central Committee, and forever follow Chairman Mao. We will brave the winds and waves and march forward forever!

The joyous news of the Party Central Committee's decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution reached the cities of Jinan, Qingdao, and Zibo in Shandong Province, and the revolutionary masses were overjoyed. They continuously sent congratulatory messages and expressed their determination to the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party and various municipal committees. The Shandong Provincial Committee and many other leading organs have been decorated with lanterns and drums, day and night, receiving revolutionary masses.

When the joyous news reached the revolutionary old base areas of Jinggangshan, Rujin, and Xingguo, many revolutionary old comrades who followed Chairman Mao in the revolution and the broad revolutionary masses held meetings and discussions, expressing their determination to stand at the forefront of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution with the revolutionary spirit of defeating the Kuomintang's armed suppression. They will resolutely follow the Party and Chairman Mao, sweep away all ghosts and monsters, and defend the socialist mountains and rivers for generations to come.

The people of the revolutionary old base area of Minxi, who have maintained a glorious revolutionary tradition, warmly applaud the Party Central Committee's decision. Some old revolutionary masses from the old revolutionary base village of Longyan County, Hou Tian Production Brigade, happily said: More than thirty years ago, Chairman Mao personally led us in the revolution, overthrowing the three great mountains. Today, Chairman Mao is personally leading us in the Cultural Revolution. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao step by step and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end. The people of Xiamen, a heroic city on the front line of Fujian Province's coastal defense, have launched a wave of learning and propaganda since hearing the Party Central Committee's decision. In the discussions, everyone unanimously agreed that the key to seriously implementing this decision of the Party Central Committee is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, taking Chairman Mao's books as the guiding direction for carrying out the Cultural Revolution.

In recent days, revolutionary masses in various places in Zhejiang Province have held meetings and written big-character posters, expressing their firm support for and implementation of this decision of the Party Central Committee.

Anhui Province's famous folk singer Yin Guanglan enthusiastically composed a folk song praising the Party Central Committee's wise decision. She sang: "The revolutionary flag flutters in the wind, the Central Committee's decision of sixteen points, the Cultural Revolution is a guiding light, a billion people laugh together, the decision is a charge signal, the workers, peasants, and soldiers are full of fighting spirit, together they open fire on the black line, the ghosts and monsters have nowhere to hide, the Party points the way for us, the revolutionary fire burns everywhere."

The broad revolutionary masses said: We will definitely respond to the great call of the Party and Chairman Mao and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The broad revolutionary masses of Shaoshan Commune in Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, the hometown of our beloved great leader Chairman Mao, were overjoyed after hearing the Party Central Committee's decision on the radio, and the shout of "Long live Chairman Mao" echoed through Shaoshan.

Huang Zushi, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works in the entire army, said: Domestic and foreign reactionaries are very afraid of our revolutionary mass movement. Because the masses have the highest awareness, the brightest eyes, and the greatest strength, they can move mountains and fill seas, smash the old world, and build a new world. In the face of the revolutionary mass movement, under the microscope and magnifying glass of Mao Zedong Thought, all ghosts and monsters will reveal their true colors.

After the Party Central Committee's decision reached Wuhan, many industrial, transportation, commerce, education, health, and other departments in Wuhan sent representatives, braving the scorching sun, beating drums and shouting slogans, to participate in the city-wide workers' representative rally. National People's Congress representative and performer of the Wuhan Acrobatics Troupe, Xia Juhua, was increasingly excited as she listened to the broadcast. Xia Juhua stood firm in the face of the countercurrent in this complex class struggle in the Cultural Revolution. She said: The more intense the struggle, the more it tests a revolutionary. Today, we are fighting against enemies who do not carry guns, and we should also have the fearless revolutionary spirit. I am determined to follow Chairman Mao forward in the great winds and waves of class struggle.

Female pilots of a certain air force unit stationed in Zhengzhou repeatedly studied the Party Central Committee's decision. Deputy Political Commissar of the Flight Squadron and active learner of Chairman Mao's works, Yu Fulan, said: This decision says that Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which speaks to the hearts of us workers, peasants, and soldiers. I support it one hundred times, one thousand times, ten thousand times!

The workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Nanning City unanimously agreed that this decision of the Party Central Committee is a great Marxist-Leninist document and the program of the Cultural Revolution. The entire Guangxi Medical College and its affiliated hospitals held a meeting of 3,000 revolutionary teachers, students, and staff, unanimously adopting a telegram to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. The telegram said: This wise decision of the Party Central Committee is the program for the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a timely rain, a steering wheel, making us even more clear-sighted.

In Lhasa, the broad Tibetan and Han revolutionary masses compared the Party Central Committee's decision to a thousand beams of golden sunlight. Ciren Sangbu, a village security chief of serf origin, said: Although the feudal serf system in Tibet has been overthrown, its old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits are still corrupting and poisoning us, attempting to restore the old system. We emancipated serfs will definitely use the new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits of the proletariat to thoroughly transform the face of Tibetan villages.
