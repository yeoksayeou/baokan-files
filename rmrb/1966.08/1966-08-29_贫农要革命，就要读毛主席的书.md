Poor peasants must revolutionize, and to do so, they must read Chairman Mao's books.

I have suffered for decades. After liberation, I stood up and became the master of my own destiny. My son, who was sold away, returned to my side. Now he has grown up and become a militia member. However, poor peasants like me, who have suffered so much, can forget our roots if we live in good times for too long. If we forget our roots, we won't want to revolutionize. If we don't revolutionize, we will return to the old path—the path where the Kuomintang reactionaries come back to rule us, and where landlords and rich peasants oppress and exploit us. That is a dark and desperate path. Therefore, we poor peasants must never forget our roots. If we don't forget our roots, we must revolutionize to the end. To revolutionize, we must read Chairman Mao's books. Chairman Mao said, "Without poor peasants, there would be no revolution." Chairman Mao's words are true. But if we poor peasants do not read Chairman Mao's books, we will not revolutionize.

I remember two years ago when the cadre and the brigade leaders came to mobilize me to study Chairman Mao's works, I said, "Studying is for the young. I am over fifty, and I have a poor memory. What is there to study?" They talked about my son's past. I said that my son being able to return to me is all thanks to Chairman Mao's kindness! They asked me, "Then, will you listen to Chairman Mao's words?" I said, "If I don't listen to his words, whose words will I listen to?" They said, "You say you will listen to Chairman Mao's words, but he is in Beijing, so far away. If you don't read the books he has written, how can you act according to his words?" They pointed this out to me, and I finally realized the truth.

Speaking of the hardships of the old society, it was like having seven layers of stone and seven layers of bricks pressing down on my head! At the age of six, I was sold to a landlord as a servant. I couldn't eat enough, let alone be beaten by the landlord's wife, leaving me with hidden injuries all over my body. Now, whenever it rains or snows, my back aches. In 1944, Huangshandong was a revolutionary base. The Kuomintang reactionaries hated us and frequently launched "sweeping" operations. In the spring of 1949, the Kuomintang launched another "sweeping" operation. I, pregnant for nine months, fled to the mountains. In the cave, I gave birth to my youngest son. For seven days and nights after giving birth, I had nothing to eat. When I went down the mountain, I found that my home had been looted clean. My husband could only go up the mountain to dig for yam and wild mushrooms to eat. Soon, he suffered stomach pain and died after two days of agony. At that time, life was unbearable, so I had to sell my children. I sold four out of six. Speaking of the past hardships, my knees would shed tears! After liberation, Chairman Mao and the Communist Party removed the seven layers of stone and seven layers of bricks from our heads. My family's life is getting better and better. The sweetness now is not just the sweetness of sugar water, but the sweetness of honey water. How can I not read Chairman Mao's books and listen to Chairman Mao's words!

Chairman Mao's books are revolutionary books. The more I listen, the more I understand. Once, cadre Tian Shijing read to me a quote: "Without poor peasants, there would be no revolution. If you deny them, you deny the revolution. If you strike them, you strike the revolution." Shijing also said that these words were spoken by Chairman Mao decades ago. As I listened, I thought of the guerrilla fighters, of how they mobilized us poor peasants to revolutionize, saying that we suffered the most, so we were the most revolutionary. Only when we poor peasants revolutionize can we overthrow the landlords, distribute the land, and become the masters of our own destiny. Their words were originally taught by Chairman Mao. Indeed, the Communist Party led us to overthrow the landlords and stand up. This shows that Chairman Mao's words are all truths, and whatever he says can be done. We poor peasants must revolutionize, and to do so, we must read Chairman Mao's books. Landlords and rich peasants are most afraid of us revolutionizing, so they most oppose us reading Chairman Mao's books. The more they oppose, the more we must learn.

Chairman Mao's words, I think about them one by one, and I use them one by one. In the past, I was selfish, putting all the good fertilizer on my private plot, only giving the ash to the production team. Now I want to learn the spirit of selflessness and dedication, giving all the good fertilizer to the team. In the past, my heart was narrow, always only seeing my own family, making small things seem like big things. Small things turned into big things, and I often quarrelled with people. After reading Chairman Mao's quotes, I knew that all revolutionary comrades must care for each other, love each other, and help each other. I thought, poor and lower-middle peasants are class brothers, flesh and blood. If we still fight all day, aren't we treating our class brothers as enemies? This would make the landlords and rich peasants happy! Therefore, I decided to correct this flaw.

Reading Chairman Mao's books is a lifelong task. In the future, I will study more actively. As long as I live, I will study.

### 贫农要革命，就要读毛主席的书

    贫农要革命，就要读毛主席的书
    坳下生产队社员　张来娇
    我受了几十年的苦，解放后翻身作了主人。卖掉的儿子古流民，又回到我的身边，现在长大成人，当基干民兵了。可是，像我这样苦大仇深的贫农，好日子过得久了，也是会忘本的。忘了本，就不想再革命。不革命，就会走回过去的老路。这条路就是国民党反动派回来统治我们，地主富农压迫剥削我们的黑路、绝路。所以，我们贫农千万不要忘本，不忘本就要革命到底。要革命，就要读毛主席的书。毛主席说：“没有贫农，便没有革命。”毛主席说得真好。可是，我们贫农不读毛主席的书，就不会革命。
    记得前年辅导员和大队干部来动员我去学习毛主席著作的时候，我说：学习是青年的事。我五十多岁了，又没记性，还学什么？他们谈到我的儿子小流民的往事。我说小流民能回到我身边，都是毛主席的恩情！他们问我，那么，毛主席的话你听不听？我说：“我不听他老人家的话，还听谁的话！”他们说：“你说要听毛主席的话，他老人家在北京，隔这么远，他说的话你听不到，他写出来的书你不去读，那怎么能照他的话去做呢？”他们这样一点，我才恍然大悟。
    讲起旧社会的苦，好比是七重石板七重砖压在我头上！我六岁就卖给地主做婢女，吃不饱不用说，还要挨地主婆的打，打的我满身暗伤。现在碰到作风作雨，我的背脊就发痛。一九四四年，黄山洞就是革命根据地。国民党反动派恨透我们，三天两头来“扫荡”。一九四九年春，国民党又来“扫荡”，我拖着九个月的大肚子往山上跑，在山洞里生下了最小的儿子，产后七天七夜没有饭吃。下山一看，家里被抢得精光。我丈夫只有上山挖土茯苓、黄狗头吃，不久就肚痛，眼光光痛了两天，就死了。那时真是没法生活下去，只好卖儿卖女，六个孩子卖了四个。讲起过去的苦，真是膝头都会出眼泪！解放了，毛主席、共产党把我们头上的七重石板七重砖搬走了，我家的生活越过越好。现在的甜，不只是白糖水的甜，是像蜜糖水那样甜。我怎能不读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话呢！
    毛主席的书是革命的书，我越听越入心。辅导员田石金有一次给我念了一条语录：“没有贫农，便没有革命。若否认他们，便是否认革命。若打击他们，便是打击革命。”石金还说，这句话是毛主席在几十年前讲的。我一边听，一边想起游击队的同志，想起他们发动我们贫农闹革命，说我们受苦最深，所以最革命。只有我们贫农起来革命，才能打倒地主，分田地，当家作主人。他们说的话，原来就是毛主席教他们说的。果然，共产党领导我们打倒地主，领导我们翻了身。可见毛主席的话，句句都是真理，讲到就一定做得到。我们贫农要革命，就要读毛主席的书。地主、富农最怕我们革命，所以最反对我们读毛主席的书。敌人越是反对，我们就越要学。
    毛主席的话，我听一句就想一下，学一点就用一点。过去，我私心重，好肥都上自留地，只把草灰交给生产队。现在要学毫不利己专门利人的精神，有好肥，就交给队。过去我心胸狭窄，成天只看到自己一家一户，手指尖的事看得像水缸大。小事变大事，就常和人吵架。读了毛主席的语录，知道一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。我想，贫下中农都是阶级兄弟，骨肉相连，如果还是终天打架，不是把自己的阶级兄弟看成敌人吗？这样，地主、富农才欢喜呢！因此，我就下决心改正了这个缺点。
    读毛主席的书是一辈子的事情，以后我要更积极学习，有多长命就学多长。
