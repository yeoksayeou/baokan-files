In the new upsurge of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the soldiers and officers of a reconnaissance platoon from a certain unit of the Nanjing Military Region have studied the "Sixteen Points" with great enthusiasm. At the same time, they have reviewed Mao Zedong's brilliant work, "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," written 39 years ago. The soldiers and officers have deepened their understanding of Mao Zedong's great thought of trusting the masses, relying on the masses, mobilizing the masses, and respecting the masses' pioneering spirit. They said: Mao Zedong's work, written 39 years ago, is so familiar and close to our hearts. Every sentence speaks to our hearts, as if Mao Zedong himself were in the platoon giving us a lecture. This has further helped us understand that the attitude towards the revolutionary mass movement is the dividing line between genuine and false revolutionaries. We must take Mao Zedong Thought as our guiding principle, study the "Sixteen Points," be familiar with the "Sixteen Points," master the "Sixteen Points," and apply the "Sixteen Points." We must actively participate in all revolutionary mass movements, enthusiastically support all revolutionary mass movements, and resolutely defend all revolutionary mass movements.

Listen to Chairman Mao's Words: "Be Bold"

Sergeant Zhou Renshou said: 39 years ago, Chairman Mao, despite various obstacles within and outside the Party, led the peasant movement in Hunan with great enthusiasm, supported the peasant movement in Hunan, and praised the peasant movement in Hunan. He set a brilliant example for all Marxists in the world. In his "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," he thoroughly criticized the fallacies that denounced the revolutionary mass movement and mercilessly attacked the bourgeois attitude of those who were afraid of the revolutionary mass movement. We must not only seriously study Chairman Mao's great teachings but also learn from Chairman Mao's great practices.

Studying the "Sixteen Points" and reviewing the "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" has made me deeply realize that to make a revolution, one must have the spirit of a revolutionary. This spirit of a revolutionary is to be bold. As long as we follow the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, believe in the courage and wisdom of the masses, and believe that the masses can educate themselves and liberate themselves, we can dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, and dare to make a revolution. We can be the vanguard of the bold in the revolutionary mass movement.

Starting from the spirit of being bold, the revolutionary mass movement is also a great school. Chairman Mao pointed out when talking about the political education effect of the peasant movement in Hunan that even if ten thousand law and politics schools were opened, they could not achieve such widespread political education in such a short time among the men, women, old, and young in remote villages. The revolutionary mass movement can cultivate people, temper people, and produce talents. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow the revolutionary course opened by Chairman Mao, and bravely go to the surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to temper ourselves, go to the surging tide of the socialist revolution to temper ourselves, and in the great school of the revolutionary mass movement, study Mao Zedong Thought and the pioneering spirit of the masses. We will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end and carry the socialist revolution through to the end!

The Movement Must Look at the Big Direction: Grasp the Essence and See the Mainstream

Youth League member and new soldier Yin Chunxiao said: The Party Central Committee decided that:

"The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres are the main force of this cultural revolution." "In such a great revolutionary movement, they are bound to have this or that shortcoming, but their revolutionary direction is always correct. This is the mainstream of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." How should we correctly view the mainstream of the cultural revolution? After reading the article "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," my mind is much clearer.

Chairman Mao said: "Without the poor peasants, there would be no revolution. If you deny them, you deny the revolution. If you attack them, you attack the revolution. Their revolutionary direction has never been wrong." The "revolutionary direction" that Chairman Mao talked about is the mainstream. At that time, some people cursed the poor peasants as "hooligans" and criticized the peasant revolutionary actions as "excessive." However, Chairman Mao first affirmed that the revolutionary direction of the poor peasants had always been correct. He gave high praise to the revolutionary actions of the poor peasants and enthusiastically praised the poor peasant masses as "the backbone of the peasant associations, the vanguard of overthrowing feudal forces, and the heroes who have accomplished the great revolutionary cause that has not been accomplished for many years." It is very clear that affirming the revolutionary direction of the masses can see the mainstream and draw the correct conclusion; grasping some minor shortcomings in the mass movement and not letting go can see the mainstream and only draw the wrong conclusion.

Chairman Mao has always taught us to look at problems comprehensively, to look at the essence first, to look at the mainstream first, otherwise, we will lose our direction. In the cultural revolution, the broad revolutionary masses, through big-character posters, big debates, big discussions, big exposures, and big criticisms, have launched a fierce attack on those open and hidden representatives of the bourgeoisie and all ghosts and monsters, exposing their true colors and stripping their skins, making them lose their prestige. The great revolutionary cause that has not been accomplished for many years is being accomplished in the high tide of the cultural revolution; the things that people did not even dare to dream of in the past are beginning to become living realities today. We revolutionary masses, in this great storm of class struggle, have universally undergone tests, tempering, raised awareness, and increased skills. As the cultural revolution deepens, a new upsurge of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is further surging across the country. The broad masses are more closely united around the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, advancing bravely along the great direction indicated by Chairman Mao! This is the mainstream of the movement. The minor shortcomings that appear in the masses' struggle are just a little dust in the fingernail crevices. We must look at the situation of the cultural revolution and all revolutionary mass movements. We must not only see the tributaries but not the mainstream, only see the parts but not the whole.

We must, under the guidance of the Party Central Committee's decision, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. In the surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must educate ourselves and liberate ourselves. We must be the vanguard of overthrowing the old world and the main force of building the new world. We must more firmly follow the great revolutionary direction indicated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao and march forward!

The Revolutionary Torrent Is Irresistible: Small Detours Are Nothing to Fear

Five Good Soldier Xie Guosen said: The peasant movement in Hunan 40 years ago developed and grew stronger in the midst of attacks by imperialists, warlords, and local tyrants, and in the face of criticism from right-opportunists within the Party. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that is currently being carried out is also developing in the struggle against various obstacles. As the "Sixteen Points" point out: "Since the cultural revolution is a revolution, it is inevitable that there will be resistance." The deeper and broader the revolution, the more it will inevitably encounter the stubborn resistance of those who have infiltrated the Party and are taking the capitalist road and the old social forces. Therefore, there will be twists and turns in the struggle, and there may even be multiple twists and turns. The revolution will advance in a tortuous manner. It is important for us revolutionary soldiers to understand this. Understanding this will increase our revolutionary courage, strengthen our fighting spirit, and make us more tenacious in fighting against the class enemy and the difficulties on the road ahead. Chairman Mao teaches us that there is no straight road in the world, and we must be prepared to take the tortuous road and not be lazy. This is the philosophy of revolutionaries and our general attitude towards struggle. We have Chairman Mao's wise leadership. The twists and turns we encounter are just twists and turns in our advance. The twists and turns we encounter are just twists and turns in our victory. As the "Sixteen Points" point out, the twists and turns in the revolutionary struggle are not harmful, "They will temper the proletariat and other laboring masses, especially the younger generation, gain experience and lessons, and understand that the road of revolution is tortuous and not smooth." With the "Sixteen Points" as our weapon, we will definitely become braver, stronger, and more experienced through struggle and achieve a complete victory.

To Correct the Distortion, It Must Be Overdone: Revolution Is Normal

Five Good Soldier Liu Qiaogang said: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is an unprecedented great revolutionary movement. In this revolutionary movement, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have overthrown the black gang members who are against the Party, against socialism, and against Mao Zedong Thought, and swept away all the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes. A large number of young revolutionaries who were previously unknown have become brave pioneers. We think all this is very good! It is normal! While the class enemies are extremely panicked and confused, they shout "abnormal" and curse "terrible." In our ranks, there are also some people who feel "sudden" and "unaccustomed" to this. I studied the "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" again with this question in mind.

Forty years ago, a stormy peasant movement swept through Hunan, disturbing the sweet dreams of the gentry. The poor peasants, who were previously looked down upon by the gentry, beaten into the mud, and had no standing in society and no right to speak, took power, issued orders, and directed everything. Reading this, I felt an indescribable joy. Today's cultural revolution is fighting against the representatives of the bourgeoisie and all ghosts and monsters. These bastards are no different from the local tyrants and evil gentry of Hunan villages in the past! Those who firmly support and actively participate in the cultural revolution will also feel a kind of unprecedented joy for today's "abnormal" phenomenon.

My understanding of what is normal and what is abnormal: First, we must analyze it with a class perspective. Different classes, standing in different positions, will have different views. What kind of vine produces what kind of melon, what class speaks what words. The representatives of the bourgeoisie occupy the ideological and cultural positions, engage in anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought evil activities, we are absolutely not allowed, they call it "normal"; the revolutionary masses rise up to smash the arrogant attacks of the bourgeoisie, seize their power, and cancel their right to speak, we think it is normal, they then shout "abnormal." This is also a kind of inversion and reinversion. Second, we must look at problems with a dialectical perspective. Overturn the old normal to create a new normal; smash the old rules of the bourgeoisie, precisely to establish a new order of the proletariat. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, such an unprecedented great mass movement, is to break first, to break thoroughly and establish thoroughly. This breaking is a revolution, a good thing, why not cheer!

Chairman Mao teaches us in the "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" that in the surging revolutionary mass movement, "To correct the distortion, it must be overdone, otherwise, it cannot be corrected." Without thoroughly breaking the old rules, the old world cannot be thoroughly destroyed, and a new world cannot be created.

    革命的群众运动万岁！
    ——南京部队某部侦察连重温《湖南农民运动考察报告》，加深理解十六条
    在无产阶级文化大革命的新高潮中，中国人民解放军南京部队某部侦察连指战员，怀着无比振奋的心情，在认真学习十六条的同时，重新学习了毛主席在三十九年前写的光辉著作《湖南农民运动考察报告》，指战员们对毛主席一贯信任群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，尊重群众的首创精神的伟大思想，更加崇拜，更加信仰。指战员们说：毛主席三十九年前写的这篇著作，现在读起来是那样亲切，句句话都说到我们心坎上，就像毛主席来到连队亲自给我们讲课一样，使我们进一步认识到：对革命群众运动采取什么态度，是真革命和假革命的分水岭。我们一定要以毛泽东思想为指导方针，学习十六条，熟悉十六条，掌握十六条，运用十六条，最积极地参加一切革命群众运动，最热情地支持一切革命群众运动，最坚决地保卫一切革命群众运动。
    听毛主席的话“敢”字当头
    排长周仁寿说：三十九年前，毛主席不顾党内外的种种阻力，以最大的热情领导湖南农民运动，支持湖南农民运动，歌颂湖南农民运动，为全世界马克思主义者，树立了光辉的典范。他在《湖南农民运动考察报告》中，彻底地批判了那种非难革命群众运动的谬论，无情地抨击了那种对待革命群众运动的叶公好龙的资产阶级老爷式态度。我们不但要认真学习毛主席的伟大教导，更要学习毛主席的伟大实践。
    学习十六条，重温《湖南农民运动考察报告》，使我更深刻地体会到，干革命，就得有个革命的样子。这个革命的样子，就是要有一个“敢”字。只要遵照党中央和毛主席的指示，坚信群众有魄力，有智慧，群众能够自己教育自己，自己解放自己，就能敢想、敢说、敢闯、敢革命，在革命群众运动中勇当“敢”字派。
    从“敢”字出发看问题，革命的群众运动也是个大学校。毛主席在谈到湖南农民运动普及政治宣传的效果时指出，开一万个法政学校，也不能在那样短时间内普及政治教育于穷乡僻壤的男女老少。革命的群众运动就是能培养人，锻炼人，出人才。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，沿着毛主席开辟的革命航道，更加奋勇地到无产阶级文化大革命的洪流中去锻炼，到社会主义革命的洪流中去锻炼，在革命群众运动的大学校里学习毛泽东思想，学习群众的革命首创精神，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把社会主义革命进行到底！
    运动要看大方向  抓住本质看主流
    共青团员、新战士殷纯侠说：党中央决定指出：
  “广大的工农兵、革命的知识分子和革命的干部，是这场文化大革命的主力军。”“在这样大的革命运动中，他们难免有这样那样的缺点，但是，他们的革命大方向始终是正确的。这是无产阶级文化大革命的主流。”我们应当怎样正确看待文化大革命的主流呢？读了《湖南农民运动考察报告》这篇文章，心里更加亮堂了。
    毛主席说：“没有贫农，便没有革命。若否认他们，便是否认革命。若打击他们，便是打击革命。他们的革命大方向始终没有错。”毛主席所说的“革命大方向”，就是主流。当时，有些人骂贫农是“痞子”，指责农民革命行动“过分”；但是毛主席却首先肯定贫农的革命大方向始终是正确的，对贫农的革命行动给以极高的评价，热烈称赞贫农群众“是农民协会的中坚，打倒封建势力的先锋，成就那多年未曾成就的革命大业的元勋。”很清楚，肯定群众革命的大方向，就能看到主流，得出正确的结论；抓住群众运动中的一些小缺点不放，就看不到主流，只能得出错误的结论。
    毛主席历来教导我们，看问题要全面，要先看本质，先看主流，不这样就会迷失方向。在文化大革命中，广大革命群众，通过大字报，大辩论，大鸣大放，大揭露，大批判，向那些公开的、隐蔽的资产阶级代表人物和一切牛鬼蛇神猛烈开火，揭他们的底，剥他们的皮，使他们威风扫地。多少年来未曾成就的伟大革命事业，正在文化大革命的高潮里成就着；过去人们连做梦也不敢想的事，今天开始成为活生生的现实。我们革命群众在这场阶级斗争的大风大浪里，普遍经受考验，得到锻炼，提高觉悟，增长才干。随着文化大革命的深入开展，一个活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮正在全国进一步轰轰烈烈地兴起，广大群众更加紧密地团结在党中央和毛主席的周围，沿着毛主席指引的伟大方向，奋勇前进！这就是运动的主流。群众在斗争中出现的一些小缺点，不过是拤在指甲缝里的一点灰。我们看文化大革命的形势，看一切革命的群众运动，决不能只见支流，不见主流，只见局部，不见全体。
    我们一定要在党中央决定的指引下，更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命的滚滚洪流当中，自己教育自己，自己解放自己，当推翻旧世界的先锋，建设新世界的主力，更坚定地遵循党中央和毛主席所指引的伟大革命方向阔步前进！
    革命洪流不可挡  小小曲折何足惧
    五好战士奚国森说：四十年前的湖南农民运动，是在帝国主义、军阀豪绅的围攻中，在党内右倾机会主义分子的责难中，发展壮大起来的。当前正在深入开展的无产阶级文化大革命，也是在同各种阻力的斗争中发展的。正如十六条中指出：“文化革命既然是革命，就不可避免地会有阻力。”革命越深入，越广阔，就必然遇到那些混进党内的走资本主义道路的当权派和旧的社会习惯势力的顽强反抗。因此，斗争会有反复，甚至可能有多次的反复。革命将是在曲折中前进的。我们革命战士懂得这一点很重要。懂得了这一点，就会增强我们的革命勇气，坚定我们的斗争信心，更顽强地同阶级敌人斗，同前进路上的困难斗。毛主席教导我们，世界上没有直路，要准备走曲折的路，不要贪便宜。这正是我们革命者的哲学，是我们对待斗争的总态度。我们有毛主席的英明领导，我们所遇到的反复只是前进中的反复，我们所遇到的曲折只是胜利中的曲折。正像十六条中指出的，革命斗争的反复和曲折，没有什么害处，“它将使无产阶级和其他劳动群众，特别是年青一代，得到锻炼，取得经验教训，懂得革命的道路是曲折的，不平坦的。”有十六条作武器，我们一定会越斗越勇敢，越斗越坚强，越斗越老练，取得彻底胜利。
    矫枉必须过正  革命就是正常
    五好战士刘乔岗说：无产阶级文化大革命，是一场史无前例的伟大革命运动。在这场革命运动中，广大的工农兵群众，以毛泽东思想为武器，把反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的黑帮分子打翻在地，横扫一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯。一大批本来不出名的革命青少年，成了勇敢的闯将。对于这一切，我们认为好得很！是正常的！而那些阶级敌人却无比的惊慌和混乱，大叫“反常”，大骂“糟得很”。在我们队伍中也有一些人对此感到“突然”“不习惯”。我带着这个问题重新学习了《湖南农民运动考察报告》。
    四十年前，湖南掀起了农民运动的暴风骤雨，搅动了绅士们的酣梦，从前为绅士们看不起，被绅士们打在泥沟里，在社会上没有立足地位，没有发言权的贫苦农民，掌了权，发号施令，指挥一切。读到这里，我真有说不出的痛快。今天的文化大革命，斗的是资产阶级代表人物和一切牛鬼蛇神，这些坏蛋跟当年湖南农村的土豪劣绅又有什么两样！凡是坚决拥护、积极参加文化大革命的革命派，对今天的这种“反常”现象，就同样会感到一种从来未有的痛快！
    看待正常和反常，我的体会：第一，要用阶级的眼光来分析。不同的阶级，站在不同的立场，就有不同的看法。什么藤结什么瓜，什么阶级说什么话。资产阶级代表人物霸占思想文化阵地，搞反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪恶活动，我们是决不容许的，他们叫做“正常”；革命群众起来粉碎资产阶级的猖狂进攻，专他们的政，取消他们的发言权，我们认为是正常，他们则大叫“反常”。这也是一种颠倒和再颠倒。第二，要用辩证的眼光看问题。反掉旧的正常，才能创造新的正常；打掉资产阶级的旧成规，正是为了建立无产阶级的新秩序。无产阶级文化大革命这样前所未有的伟大群众运动，就是要破字当头，大破大立。这种破，就是革命，是好事，为什么不拍手欢庆！
    毛主席在《湖南农民运动考察报告》里教导我们，在轰轰烈烈的革命群众运动中，“矫枉必须过正，不过正不能矫枉”。不彻底破坏旧成规，就不能彻底摧毁旧世界，就不可能打出一个新世界。
