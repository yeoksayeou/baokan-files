Joy fills the revolutionary historic city
The people of Zunyi say: Chairman Mao, we will definitely follow your words and forever follow you in revolution

The news of the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party spread to the revolutionary historic city of Zunyi, and the entire city was filled with joy. The sounds of gongs, cheers, slogans, and firecrackers echoed through the sky. Streets and alleys were decorated with lanterns and banners, and everywhere were vivid and eye-catching large banners and colorful flags fluttering in the wind. The entire city was immersed in a joyful atmosphere. On the 14th, tens of thousands of people marched, holding high red flags, carrying large portraits of Chairman Mao, and holding golden, shining red determination books, surging like a tide to the location of the Zunyi Municipal Party Committee and the Zunyi Municipal Party Committee to congratulate them.

Former Red Army veterans Cao Musheng and Wu Yisheng, who followed Chairman Mao over the snow-capped mountains and grasslands, said with great emotion: Chairman Mao, you are truly wise and great. You have issued a great call to the people of the entire country to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat and the socialist revolution to the end, pointing out the direction for us to advance. We will definitely follow your words and forever follow you in revolution.

　　欢声充满革命历史名城
    遵义市的革命群众说：毛主席啊，我们一定听您的话，永远跟着您闹革命
    党的八届十一中全会公报的喜讯，传到革命历史名城遵义市后，全城万众欢腾，锣鼓声、欢呼声、口号声、爆竹声响彻云霄，大街小巷张灯结彩，到处是鲜艳夺目的巨幅标语和迎风招展的彩旗，全市沉浸在一片欢乐的气氛中。十四日这天，数万人的游行队伍高举红旗，抬着毛主席巨幅画像，拿着金光闪闪的红色决心书，像潮水一样涌到中共遵义地委和中共遵义市委所在地贺喜。
    曾经跟随毛主席爬雪山、过草地的退休老红军曹木生、吴义生无限激动地说：毛主席啊，您真是英明伟大。您向全国人民发出了把无产阶级文化大革命和社会主义革命进行到底的伟大号召，给我们指明了前进的方向。我们一定听您的话，永远跟着您闹革命。
