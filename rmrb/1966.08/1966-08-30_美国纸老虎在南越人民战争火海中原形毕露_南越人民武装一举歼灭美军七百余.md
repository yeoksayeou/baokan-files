The American paper tiger has been exposed in the fires of the people's war in South Vietnam. The armed forces of South Vietnam have annihilated more than seven hundred American troops in a single battle.

According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on the 29th, the Liberation Radio of South Vietnam reported: From August 6th to 13th, the Liberation Army, local forces, and guerrillas in the provinces of Quy Nhon and Tam Ky in Quang Nam worked closely together, fought bravely, and once again plunged the invading American and puppet troops into the fires of the people's war. They annihilated nearly 1,500 enemy troops, including 750 American Marines; destroyed 13 M-113 type amphibious armored vehicles, one military truck, and shot down 23 helicopters. This is another large-scale victory for the Liberation Forces in the rainy season, completely shattering the enemy's "sweeping" operations and exposing the American paper tiger once again.

Quy Nhon County is located southwest of Da Nang. The first highway to its east connects the American Marine bases in Da Nang and Chu Lai. From the day the American invaders occupied Da Nang and Chu Lai, they have continuously carried out "pacification" operations in the counties of Quy Nhon, Thang Binh, and Tam Ky, attempting to establish a safe perimeter for the two strategic bases. However, the liberated areas in Quy Nhon, Thang Binh, and Tam Ky have remained steadfast. The enemy's outposts and bases have been tightly surrounded by the guerrillas, becoming isolated islands in the vast sea of the people's war.

On August 6th, the American and puppet forces assembled fifteen battalions, supported by numerous aircraft and artillery, to launch a large-scale "sweeping" operation. That morning, after the B-52 strategic bombers had bombed the area, the enemy forces split into two columns. The vanguard of the first column had just reached the vicinity of Linh Thượng and Sơn Trà villages in Quy Nhon County when they stepped on the traps and landmines set by the guerrillas. Some were pierced by caltrops, while others were blown to pieces. Before they could recover from their shock, the Liberation Army's firepower swept in from behind, causing heavy casualties among the enemy. The first wave of enemy troops was thus blocked. The three battalions of puppet Marines attacking the villages of Thạch Thắng, Phước Long, and Phổ Thạch met the same fate.

The entire southwestern region of Quy Nhon County became a fierce battlefield. The Liberation Forces held off the enemy's attacks from twelve infantry and armored battalions, killing and wounding more than four hundred enemy troops, shooting down fifteen helicopters, and destroying multiple armored vehicles.

On August 10th, the American Marines, leaving behind the first column of puppet troops facing annihilation, fled towards Tam Ky. But the Liberation Army had already set up an ambush in the Lệ Giang and Cẩm Lệ areas, ten kilometers west of Tam Ky. An entire battalion of enemy troops was almost completely annihilated. On the morning of the 12th, the guerrillas continued their attacks on the American troops. That night, the Liberation Forces also bombarded the American forward command post three kilometers west of Tam Ky, annihilating a large number of enemy troops.

Thus, the enemy's large-scale "sweeping" operation was thoroughly shattered.

    美国纸老虎在南越人民战争火海中原形毕露
    南越人民武装一举歼灭美军七百余
    据新华社河内二十九日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：从八月六日到十三日，广南省桂山、三岐两县解放军、地方部队和游击队紧密配合，英勇战斗，使前来“扫荡”的美伪军又一次陷入人民战争的火海中，一举消灭敌人近一千五百名，其中有美国海军陆战队七百五十名；击毁敌人M—113型两栖装甲车十三辆，军用卡车一辆，击落直升飞机二十三架。这是解放武装力量在雨季中粉碎敌人的又一次大规模“扫荡”，使美国纸老虎再显原形。
    桂山县在岘港的西南面，它的东面的第一号公路，是连接岘港和朱莱两个美国海军陆战队基地的交通动脉。美国侵略者从它盘踞岘港和朱莱的第一天起，就不停地对桂山、升平、三岐等县进行“绥靖”，企图为岘港和朱莱这两个战略基地建立起一个安全的外围地带。但是桂山、升平、三岐县的解放区却始终巍然屹立。美伪的一些据点和基地被游击队紧紧地包围住，成了人民战争汪洋大海中的一个个孤岛。
    八月六日，美伪集团拼凑了十五个营的美伪军，在许多飞机、大炮的掩护下展开一次大规模的“扫荡”。那天上午，在B—52型战略轰炸机轰炸过后，美伪军分成两路进犯。第一路敌军的先头部队刚开到桂山县灵上、山茶村附近，就踩中了游击队设置的陷阱和地雷，有的被蒺藜刺穿脚板，有的被炸得血肉横飞，当他们惊魂未定的时候，解放军的火力又从他们的背后猛扫过来，敌军死伤狼藉。第一股敌人就这样被堵住了。进攻石尚、福隆、盘石各村的伪海军陆战队三个营也遭到同样的命运。
    整个桂山县西南地区变成了一个激烈的战场，解放武装力量顶住了敌人十二个步兵营和装甲营的进攻，打死打伤敌人四百多名，击落直升飞机十五架，并击毁装甲车多辆。
    八月十日，美国海军陆战队丢下正面临灭顶之灾的第一路伪军，自己向三岐市方向逃走。但解放军早已走在他们的前面，在距三岐市西面十公里的来格、锦溪地区布置好伏击阵地，一营敌军几乎被全部歼灭。十二日上午，游击队继续向美军展开进攻。当晚，解放武装力量还轰击了距三岐市西面三公里的美军战地指挥所，又歼灭了大批敌军。
    就这样，美伪军这次大“扫荡”被彻底粉碎了。
