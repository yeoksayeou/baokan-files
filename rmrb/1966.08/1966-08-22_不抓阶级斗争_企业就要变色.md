	Failure to Grasp Class Struggle Will Lead to Enterprise Decline

	Sun Yefang talks about how "economics is the contradiction between 'people' and 'things,'" and that the contradiction between "people" and "things" is the "most profound internal contradiction of the socialist economy." This is a hackneyed phrase of modern revisionism.

	Before liberation, we often heard capitalists in the factory say, "Workers just need to work and earn money to eat." They tried to lull us into not rising up to struggle against them, allowing their exploitation and oppression to continue. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we stood up and became the masters of the factory. However, class struggle still exists. Some landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in our factory often say, "Just work hard, don't harm the atmosphere among us." They are most afraid of class struggle. We must grasp class struggle. Chairman Mao teaches us that class struggle still exists in socialist society. Chairman Mao's teachings have heightened our vigilance. Our struggle against class enemies has never stopped.

	Take our shop as an example. Workers deal with machines every day. On the surface, it seems like this is just a relationship between people and things, but in reality, class struggle is intense. We must resolutely implement political leadership, but some people want to implement monetary leadership; we must resolutely walk the socialist path, but some people want to walk the capitalist path. Our shop has a worker of peasant origin who was once a model worker. For a period, he often associated with some shady characters outside the factory. These people often instilled bourgeois ideas of indulgence in him, and his thoughts gradually became corrupted by bourgeois ideas. Therefore, he did not work hard in the factory, wanting to buy a car and a horse, cultivate private plots, and take the capitalist road. Later, we mobilized him to study Chairman Mao's works. His class consciousness was raised, and he realized he had fallen for capitalist tricks. He turned around and denounced the bourgeoisie. His thoughts changed, and his productivity increased. He became a model worker again last year. Before and after, the same worker walked two different paths and had two different production performances. Can this be said to be just a contradiction between "people" and "things"?

	The struggle between the two types of operational thinking is also intense in terms of what to produce. Our factory produces a type of crane. When production began, some parts were at a loss. At that time, some representatives of the bourgeoisie said, "No profit, no production." However, this crane is a product urgently needed by society, and we resolutely carried out the production. Isn't this class struggle, rather than just a contradiction between "people" and "things"?

	Sun Yefang's denial of class struggle is malicious. Because whether or not to grasp class struggle is a matter of the fate of our descendants for generations to come, a matter of the fate and future of our country, and a major issue of preventing revisionism and preventing the restoration of capitalism. The workers in our shop say, "Class struggle is a treasure, never forget it." If you don't struggle against bourgeois ideology, it will grab you; if you don't strike it down, it will corrupt you. If you don't grasp class struggle, our ranks will turn, and the enterprise will change color. Sun Yefang's shout about the contradiction between "people" and "things" being the most profound internal contradiction of the socialist economy exposes his intention to make us focus only on the economy, not on politics; to see only things, not people; to make us focus only on profits, abandon political leadership, abandon class struggle, and abandon the ideological transformation of people. In short, Sun Yefang opposes Mao Zedong Thought leading the way, attempting to change the socialist system, and restore capitalism. What a vicious plot! We must thoroughly criticize and expose him.

    不抓阶级斗争  企业就要变色
    齐齐哈尔车辆工厂锻工车间主任　苍文芳
    指导员　景全德　王长胜
    孙冶方说什么“经济是‘人’与‘物’两个因素的矛盾统一体”，“人”与“物”的矛盾是“社会主义经济的最深远的内在矛盾”。这是现代修正主义的陈词滥调。
    解放前，我们在工厂就常听资本家说：“工人嘛，就管干活，挣钱吃饭就行了。”他们企图麻痹我们不要起来和他们斗争，听任他们的剥削和压迫。解放后，我们在党和毛主席的领导下翻了身，成了工厂的主人。但是，阶级斗争依然存在。我们厂有些地富反坏右分子就常说：“好好干活就行了，相互间不要伤了和气。”他们最怕阶级斗争，我们就是要抓阶级斗争。毛主席教导我们，社会主义社会还存在着阶级和阶级斗争。毛主席的教导提高了我们的警惕性。我们和阶级敌人的斗争，就一直没有停止。
    就拿我们车间来说吧，工人们天天和机器打交道。表面看，好象这只是人和物的关系，可是里边阶级斗争很激烈。我们要坚决实行政治挂帅，有人却想实行钞票挂帅；我们要坚决走社会主义道路，有人却想走资本主义道路。我们车间有一名农民出身的五好工人，有一段时期，他经常和社会上一些不三不四的人打交道，这些人常向他灌输资产阶级吃喝玩乐的思想，他的思想就逐渐被资产阶级思想侵蚀了。因此，他在工厂不好好劳动，想自个儿拴车买马，种自留地，要走资本主义道路。后来，我们动员他学习毛主席著作。他提高了无产阶级觉悟，认识到自己上了资本主义的当，回过头来，控诉了资产阶级。他思想变了，生产积极性就高了，去年他又重新成了五好工人。前后同是一个工人，却走着两条不同的道路，有着两种不同的生产表现，难道说这只是“人”和“物”的矛盾吗？
    在为什么而生产方面，两种经营思想的斗争也是很激烈的。我们厂生产一种吊车，开始生产时，有些部件是赔本的。当时有的资产阶级代表人物说，“没利润，不生产”。但是，这种吊车是社会急需的产品，我们坚决进行了生产。难道这不是阶级斗争，而只是“人”和“物”的矛盾吗？
    孙冶方抹杀阶级斗争，是别有用心的。因为抓不抓阶级斗争，是关系到我们子孙万代的命运问题，关系到我们国家的命运和前途问题，关系到防止修正主义和防止资本主义复辟的大问题。我们车间的工人说：“阶级斗争是个宝，千万千万别忘了。”你不斗资产阶级思想，它就要抓你；你不打击它，它就要腐蚀你。你不抓阶级斗争，我们的队伍就要转向，企业就要变色。孙冶方叫嚷“人”与“物”的矛盾，是社会主义经济最深远的内在矛盾，戳穿了它，就是要我们只重视经济，不要突出政治；只见物，不见人；让我们只抓利润，放弃突出政治，放弃阶级斗争，放弃抓人的思想革命化。一句话，孙冶方反对毛泽东思想挂帅，企图改变社会主义制度，复辟资本主义，这是多么狠毒的阴谋！我们一定要把他彻底斗垮、斗臭。
