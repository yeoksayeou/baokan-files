The joyous news of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao meeting a million revolutionary masses in the capital has spread to every corner of our motherland. People of all ethnic groups across the nation are cheering in unison: "Chairman Mao is the shining example of trusting and relying on the masses. Chairman Mao is our most beloved leader and also the person closest to our hearts. Chairman Mao is always with us, heart to heart. Following Chairman Mao means victory!"

In the Shannan Prefecture of Tibet, many revolutionary masses shed tears of joy upon hearing the news of Chairman Mao meeting a million revolutionary masses. They said: Chairman Mao is always with us, always with the revolutionary masses heart to heart. With Chairman Mao's wise leadership, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will surely achieve thorough victory, and the socialist revolution will surely achieve thorough victory. The broad masses of farmers and herdsmen in the Qien County of the northern Tibetan grasslands sang and danced in joy, expressing their love for Chairman Mao. The revolutionary masses of the trading company and the people's hospital in the Naqu Prefecture shed tears of joy and sang "The Ship Sails on Because of the Helmsman" after hearing the news. They excitedly said: Chairman Mao is always by our side. Chairman Mao cares for, trusts, and supports our revolutionary actions the most. We will not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations. We fear neither heaven nor earth and vow to be the vanguards of the Cultural Revolution.

In the Tian Shan mountains of Xinjiang, people of all ethnic groups have been immersed in boundless joy these days. In the border city of Yining, over fifty thousand revolutionary masses from thirteen ethnic groups held a grand celebration a few days ago. A Kazakh student from the Yili Normal School, Ablai, said at the meeting: Chairman Mao's meeting with a million revolutionary masses at Tiananmen Square has given us boundless fighting strength. We ethnic minorities in the border areas suffered endless humiliation and oppression from class enemies in the old society. It is our great leader Chairman Mao who led us to a new world. We will definitely hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely and thoroughly smash the old world, and build a new world for the proletariat. The Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture held meetings and parades in various counties and cities, with over twenty thousand people participating. Xiao Da Si Pai, a Kazakh worker from the Yili Construction Company who had seen Chairman Mao in Beijing, sent a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao after hearing the news. He excitedly said: "Chairman Mao! It is you who liberated me, a Kazakh from the mountains, from the sufferings of the old society, educated me, and made me the master of the state. You are our great savior, the red sun in our hearts. We miss you every moment. With you leading the way, we dare to brave the stormy seas and dare to climb the mountains of knives and the seas of fire. I will read your books all my life and follow you in revolution forever."

On the grasslands of Xilin Gol in Inner Mongolia, many Mongolian herdsmen are overjoyed. They said: This year, we encountered rare droughts, windstorms, and epidemics, but because we studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, we showed revolutionary spirit and still achieved a significant increase in livestock. In the future, we must remember Chairman Mao's teachings, never forget class struggle, and follow the Party and Chairman Mao on the socialist path.

The news reached the Qinghai Nationalities Institute, where over 1,400 faculty, staff, and students of various ethnic groups dressed in new ethnic costumes and set out from the school at five in the morning, walking fifteen miles to the city to participate in a rally. They could not contain their joy, shouting slogans in different languages of their ethnic groups, singing and dancing, and praising the great leader Chairman Mao. A Tibetan "Three Good" student, A Wu Ga Ga, was very excited and said: Before liberation, three out of seven in my family starved to death, and I started working as a slave for the herdsman at the age of eleven. It is only because of Chairman Mao that the Tibetan people have been liberated. Chairman Mao is the eternal red sun in the hearts of the Tibetan people. We will always follow Chairman Mao's words and follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life.

The revolutionary young fighters of the Guangxi Arts Institute wrote poems and composed songs to praise the great leader Chairman Mao after hearing the news. A Miao student who had begged on the streets with his parents in the old society said with tears in his eyes: "Chairman Mao, at his age, met with revolutionary masses from the capital and all over the country at five in the morning. This is the greatest trust, care, and support for the revolutionary masses. Chairman Mao's encouragement to revolutionary teachers and students in the capital and other cities is also encouragement to us. With the great commander Chairman Mao fighting alongside us, we will surely learn revolution in the revolutionary struggle. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words, be vanguards in the Cultural Revolution, and carry out the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end."
