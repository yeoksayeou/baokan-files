The ninth and tenth volumes of the *Complete Works of Lu Xun*, published in October 1958 by the People's Literature Publishing House, were edited under the control of Zhou Yang and others. These volumes omitted many important letters in which Lu Xun criticized Zhou Yang's slogan of "National Defense Literature" and his errors of sectarianism and cliquism. This was an attempt to cover up the truth, deceive the public, and resist Chairman Mao's evaluation of Lu Xun and his criticism of Zhou Yang.

In the "Explanation of Volume Nine" of this *Complete Works of Lu Xun*, the editors deceitfully claimed that out of more than a thousand letters from Lu Xun, they "selected the most meaningful ones, excluding general correspondence, totaling 334 letters." This is a blatant lie! In fact, the more than 800 letters that were omitted, many of which are crucial in exposing Zhou Yang's clique, are important historical documents. Here are a few selected letters for everyone to judge whether they are of great significance or merely "general correspondence":

	“Every year I think about resting a bit, but public affairs, private matters, and idle talk only increase, leaving no time for rest, no time for reading, and no time to write letters. The illness is mostly gone, but I still lack energy, or my energy is not enough to handle various tasks; my memory is also failing. Heroes keep coming to attack. Recently, here they are holding a Writers' Association meeting, shouting about 'National Defense Literature.' I, having learned from past experiences, did not join, and the heroes immediately declared my crimes at the meeting. I could indeed do nothing and be guiltless. However, China is not entirely theirs, and I also want to live here, so recently I have written two articles to counterattack. They are hollow shells and will soon disappear: this type of person has already appeared many times before.” (May 4, 1936)

	“Moreover, because I did not join the association, the immortals have laid out a siege, and Xu Mo-yong, knowing that I was near death not long ago, still bravely came to attack first... In fact, although the letter is written by him alone, it represents a certain group. If you read it carefully, you can see the tone and understand. Therefore, I think it is more necessary to give a public reply. If this were just a personal matter between us, unrelated to the big picture, then why bother to chatter in the publications? Mr. [Chen] Yuan, considering this matter, is wasting energy, which is not entirely the case. Shining a light can reveal the faces of the demons hiding under the banner... They will eventually reveal their true selves in front of everyone.” (August 28, 1936)

	“Here, there is a type of writer who is actually a Tianjin-style hoodlum. They specialize in spreading rumors, intimidation, and manipulation to set up nets and lure unsuspecting young literary talents to create positions for themselves; their works, however, are non-existent. They truly excel in buzzing around... They have their own group, colluding with each other, controlling the literary world, making it chaotic. If my illness improves a bit, I will still expose them, and then the future of Chinese literature will be somewhat saved.” (September 15, 1936)

	“The enemy is not to be feared; the most frightening thing is the termites within our own camp, who have ruined many things. Therefore, sometimes it makes me feel lonely... However, I have no intention of retreating.” (December 6, 1934)

	“The enemy is not to be feared; the most disheartening and discouraging thing is the backstabbing from within our own ranks; the smiling faces after being injured. Therefore, if injured, one must hide in the deep forest, lick one's wounds, and bandage them, without anyone knowing. I think this situation is terrifying.” (April 23, 1935)

In these letters, Lu Xun, with great indignation, exposed the ugly faces and despicable actions of Zhou Yang and his ilk, who hide under the banner. Therefore, these fake revolutionary "heroes" have always been terrified of Lu Xun's righteous and stern letters, to the point of taking advantage of the publication of the *Complete Works of Lu Xun* to destroy evidence and forge history.

### 鲁迅的信揭了周扬的底

　　鲁迅的信揭了周扬的底
    一九五八年十月由人民文学出版社出版的《鲁迅全集》第九、十卷中所选辑的《书信》，在周扬等人的控制下，竟将鲁迅有关批评周扬的“国防文学”口号和关门主义、宗派主义等错误的许多重要书信，一概删除，妄图掩盖真相，瞒天过海，抗拒毛主席对鲁迅的评价和对周扬的批评。
    在这部《鲁迅全集》的“第九卷说明”中，编者诡称从一千多封鲁迅书简中“加以挑选，即择取较有意义的，一般来往信件都不编入，计共收三三四封。”这是当面撒谎！其实被删除的八百余封所谓“一般来往信件”，其中很多是触及周扬一伙要害的东西，是揭周扬一伙老底的重要史料。现在选摘几封，请大家评判一下，究竟是大“有意义”的，还是所谓“一般来往信件”之类：
      “……年年想休息一下，而公事，私事，闲气之类，有增无减，不遑安息，不遑看书，弄得信也没工夫写。病总算是好了，但总是没气力，或者气力不够应付杂事；记性也坏起来。英雄们却不绝的来打击。近日这里在开作家协会，喊国防文学，我鉴于前车，没有加入，而英雄们即认此为破坏国家大计，甚至在集会上宣布我的罪状。我其实也真的可以什么也不做了，不做倒无罪。然而中国究竟也不是他们的，我也要住住，所以近来已作二文反击，他们是空壳，大约不久就要消声匿迹的：这一流人，先前已经出了不少。”（一九三六年五月四日）
    “……而且正因为不入协会，群仙就大布围剿阵，徐懋庸也明知我不久之前，病得要死，却雄纠纠首先打上门来也。……其实，写这信的虽是他一个，却代表着某一群，试一细读，看那口气，即可了然。因此我以为更有公开答复之必要。倘只我们彼此个人间事，无关大局，则何必在刊物上喋喋哉。先生虑此事，徒费精力，实不尽然，投一光辉，可使伏在大纛荫下的群魔嘴脸毕现……他们到底将在大家的眼前露出本相。”（一九三六年八月二十八日）
      “……这里的有一种文学家，其实就是天津之所谓青皮，他们就专用造谣、恫吓、播弄手段张网，以罗致不知底细的文学青年，给自己造地位；作品呢，却并没有。真是唯以嗡嗡营营为能事。……他们自有一伙，狼狈为奸，把持着文学界，弄得乌烟瘴气。我病倘稍愈，还要给以暴露的，那么，中国文艺的前途庶几有救。”（一九三六年九月十五日）
      “……敌人是不足惧的，最可怕的是自己营垒里的蛀虫，许多事都败在他们手里。因此，就有时会使我感到寂寞。……然而我毫无退缩之意。”（一九三四年十二月六日）
      “……敌人不足惧，最令人寒心而且灰心的，是友军中的从背后来的暗箭；受伤之后，同一营垒中的快意的笑脸。因此，倘受了伤，就得躲入深林，自己舐干，扎好，给谁也不知道。我以为这境遇是可怕的。”（一九三五年四月二十三日）
    在这些信件里，鲁迅怀着满腔的激愤，一针见血地揭露了周扬之流“伏在大纛荫下”的丑恶嘴脸和无耻行径，所以这帮假革命的“英雄们”对鲁迅这些义正辞严的信件一向害怕得要死，终至趁《鲁迅全集》的出版下了毒手，想消灭罪证，伪造历史。
