The process of ideological transformation is one of "enlightenment, struggle, and change." It relies on oneself, but also on the help of comrades. This involves the question of how to deal with criticism.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We have the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, which is Marxism-Leninism. We can get rid of bad work styles and maintain good work styles." He also says: "Whether there is serious self-criticism is one of the prominent signs that distinguish us from other political parties." I did not fully understand these words in the past and did not use them well. I would say that I welcome criticism, but in reality, I often saw other people's criticisms as "exposing my shortcomings" and felt uncomfortable. Therefore, many old habits became "chronic illnesses" and were not corrected quickly.

In the matter of how to deal with criticism from the masses, I went through a process from "fear" to "no fear," from "don't like" to "like." At first, if the masses' opinions had any discrepancies, I could not accept them and would get a bit annoyed. Later, I studied Chairman Mao's words: "Others cannot raise different opinions, and if they do, you get unhappy. You only like to hear flattery and do not like to hear criticism.... This is a very bad style, which hinders the progress of our cause and also hinders the progress of our comrades." From studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," I further realized: whether one fears criticism or welcomes it is a sign of whether a Communist Party member, a revolutionary cadre, is wholeheartedly serving the people or only half-heartedly. If one is wholeheartedly serving the people, one should admit mistakes when wrong, persist in what is good for the people's interests, and correct what is wrong. Humble acceptance of criticism from the broad masses means giving up only one's shortcomings and mistakes, but gaining progress in thought and work.

With improved ideological understanding, my attitude towards criticism also changed. Once, the masses gave me a piece of advice, saying that I had taken construction materials without the approval of my superiors. Although this matter was not handled by me, I did not feel wronged by the masses' criticism. I thought: as a leading cadre of the regiment, regardless of who did it, I am responsible. Moreover, I have had this bad habit before, and it seems that it still has an impact among the masses. The masses raising issues shows that the masses still do not believe that I have completely corrected my mistakes. This is the alarm that the masses have given me, and it is also the greatest care that the masses have shown me.

In practice, I also realized: sometimes the masses' criticisms are a bit sharp, and one should dare to face them. When the troops first arrived at a certain place, it was winter, and there were few stoves. The logistics department took care of us, the few leading cadres. The comrades in the office could not warm up, and some said to me: "During the day, you are the regiment commander, and at night, it's our turn to be the 'regiment commander.'" These words were harsh to hear. But upon careful analysis, the masses' criticism was very reasonable. Didn't Chairman Mao teach us to care about the masses' lives? Yet precisely, I did not care enough about the masses' lives. We immediately discussed with the relevant personnel and solved the stove problem.

To keep moving forward, it is not enough to just stay at the stage of not fearing others' opinions. One must actively seek the help of the masses. After correcting my attitude towards the masses' criticism, sometimes if I did not hear the masses' criticism for a period, I would feel very uneasy. Last year, during the Four Good evaluations, the masses had fewer opinions about me, and I felt very uneasy in my heart. How could there be no shortcomings in doing work? I found a few comrades to give me advice. Everyone had criticisms, hopes, and demands for me, which helped me a lot. I deeply felt that the masses' eyes are the ruler, and their hearts are the scale. The masses see most clearly and know best what one does. To overcome shortcomings and keep moving forward, one must listen to the masses' opinions and completely place oneself under the supervision of the masses.

### 从“怕”到“不怕”　从“不喜欢”到“喜欢”

　　从“怕”到“不怕”　从“不喜欢”到“喜欢”

    思想改造的过程，是一个“亮、斗、改”的过程。靠自己，也要靠同志们帮。这里就有一个怎样对待批评的问题。
    毛主席教导说：“我们有批评和自我批评这个马克思列宁主义的武器。我们能够去掉不良作风，保持优良作风。”还说：“有无认真的自我批评，也是我们和其他政党互相区别的显著的标志之一。”对这些话，我过去一直领会不深，用的不好。口头上说是欢迎批评，实际上常常把别人的批评，看成是“揭自己的短”，和自己过意不去。所以，许多老毛病成了“顽固症”，改正不快。
    在如何对待群众批评的问题上，我经历了一个从“怕”到“不怕”，从“不喜欢”到“喜欢”的过程。开始，群众的意见有一点出入，就接受不了，就有些恼火。后来，我学习了毛主席的这段话：“别人提不得不同的意见，提了就不高兴。只爱听恭维的话，不爱听批评的话。……这是一种很不好的作风，这种作风阻塞着我们事业的进步，也阻塞着工作人员的进步。”又从学习《为人民服务》中，我进一步认识到：怕不怕批评，欢迎不欢迎批评，这是衡量一个共产党员、一个革命干部是全心全意为人民服务，还是半心半意为人民服务的标志之一。如果是全心全意为人民服务，就应该错了认错，为了人民的利益坚持好的，改正错的。虚心接受来自广大群众的批评，丢掉的只是自己的缺点和错误，得到的却是思想和工作上的进步。
    思想认识有了提高，对待批评的态度也跟着有了转变。有一次，群众给我提了一条意见，说我不经上级的批准，拉走了施工用的油料。虽然这件事不是我办的，对群众的批评，我却没有感到委屈。我是这样想的：自己是团的领导干部，不管事情是谁办的，自己都负有责任。再说，我过去也有过这种毛病，看来在群众中还有影响。群众提意见，正说明群众还不相信我彻底改正了错误。这是群众给我敲的警钟，也是群众对我的最大爱护。
    在实践中，我还认识到：有时群众提的意见尖锐一点，也要敢于正视。部队刚到某地，正是冬天，炉子少，管理股照顾了我们几个领导干部。机关的同志烤不上火，有的就对我说：“白天你当团长，晚上就轮到我们当‘团长’了。”这话听来刺耳。认真一分析，群众的批评很有道理。毛主席不是教导我们要关心群众生活吗？而恰恰自己对群众生活关心不够。我们马上和有关人员研究，解决了炉具问题。
    要不断前进，光停留在不怕别人提意见的阶段还不够，还要主动地争取群众的帮助。端正了对待群众批评的态度以后，有时在一段时间内，听不到群众的批评，反而感到心里很发虚。去年四好总评中，群众对我的意见较少，我心里觉得很不安，做工作那能没有缺点呢！我找了几个同志给我提意见，大家对我有批评、有希望，也有要求，对我帮助很大。我深深体会到，群众的眼睛是尺、心是秤，自己做的怎么样，群众看得最准，心里最清楚。要克服缺点，不断前进，就必须听取群众的意见，完全把自己置于群众的监督之下。
