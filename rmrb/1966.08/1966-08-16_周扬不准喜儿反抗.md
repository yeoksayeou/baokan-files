    Zhou Yang opposed Joy's resistance when the new opera "White-Haired Girl" was first performed in Yan'an.

    He spoke out, saying that Joy should not resist and should not have a strong class character. He absurdly claimed that "Joy should have illusions about Huang Shiren!" "She should have illusions about marrying Huang Shiren!" This is the most vicious slander against the working people!

    He opposed the execution of the evil landlord Huang Shiren in "White-Haired Girl." The poor farmers of Qiaozigou, the revolutionary teachers and students of Lu Xun Academy of Arts, and the cooks all advocated executing Huang Shiren. However, Zhou Yang, using the excuse of the united front and rent reduction, opposed the execution of Huang Shiren. He protected Huang Shiren, which is consistent with his stance of protecting his landlord mother!

    Zhou Yang injected a large amount of class capitulationism and servile ideology into "White-Haired Girl" in this way.

　　周扬不准喜儿反抗
    新歌剧《白毛女》刚在延安演出时，周扬就跳出来大放厥词。
    他不准喜儿反抗，不许喜儿有坚强的阶级性格。他胡说什么“喜儿对黄世仁应当有幻想嘛！”“应当幻想与黄世仁结婚嘛！”这是对劳动人民的最恶毒的污蔑！
    他不准在《白毛女》里枪毙罪大恶极的地主黄世仁。桥儿沟的贫农、鲁艺的革命师生、炊事员，都主张枪毙。可是周扬却以当时是统一战线、减租减息为借口，不准枪毙黄世仁。他保护黄世仁，是和保护他地主分子母亲的立场一脉相通的！
    周扬就是这样把大量阶级投降主义和奴才思想的毒汁，灌进《白毛女》里去的。
