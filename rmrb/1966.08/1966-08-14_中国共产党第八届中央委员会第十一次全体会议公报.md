The Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was held in Beijing from August 1 to 12, 1966. The session was presided over by Comrade Mao Zedong. Members and alternate members of the Central Committee attended the meeting. Comrades from the Central Bureau and the Party Committees of provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, members of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, comrades from relevant departments of the Central Committee, and representatives of revolutionary teachers and students from universities in the capital attended the meeting as non-voting delegates.

The Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee discussed and adopted the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

The plenary session reviewed and approved the major decisions and measures on domestic and international issues made by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee since the Tenth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee in September 1962.

Domestic

Comrade Mao Zedong made a correct analysis of the situation at the Tenth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and once again emphasized the theory of contradictions, classes, and class struggle in socialist society. This serves as a guide for our socialist revolution and socialist construction. Over the past four years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, and guided by the general line of building socialism with great, daring, and pioneering spirit, and with high speed, good quality, and low cost, our people have launched the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, achieving great victories. The people's communes have been further consolidated and developed. The country is brimming with revolutionary fervor, and a new all-around leap forward is on the horizon.

Our national economy is developing steadily and healthily. The policy of adjustment, consolidation, enrichment, and improvement proposed by the Party Central Committee has been successfully implemented. Starting from this year, the Third Five-Year Plan has been put into effect. On the industrial front, not only the quantity of products but also the variety, quality, and standards have seen significant improvements. In agriculture, good harvests have been achieved for four consecutive years. The market is thriving, and prices are stable. The success of the three nuclear tests has demonstrated the new level of our scientific and technological development and industrial progress.

In recent years, extensive socialist education movements have been carried out in rural areas, cities, and the military across the country. Now, an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is sweeping across our country. The movement of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and cadres studying and applying Comrade Mao Zedong's works has opened a new era for the laboring people to directly grasp and apply Marxism-Leninism.

The plenary session fully agrees with the "Draft Decision on Several Current Issues in Rural Work" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on May 20, 1963, and fully agrees with the minutes of the national work conference convened by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on January 14, 1965: "Some Current Issues in the Socialist Education Movement in Rural Areas," known as the "Twenty-Three Articles." These two documents, formulated under the personal leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, are powerful ideological weapons for the Chinese people to carry out the socialist revolution. In rural areas and cities, we should continue to follow these two documents, in conjunction with the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to carry out the "Four Cleans" movement, that is, the socialist education movement to clean up politics, ideology, organization, and economics, to the end.

The plenary session fully agrees with the series of wise decisions made by Comrade Mao Zedong in the past four years. These decisions mainly include:

	* The issue of implementing the principle of democratic centralism and carrying forward the revolutionary tradition of the mass line,
	* The issue of cultivating and training successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause,
	* The call to learn from Daqing in industry, learn from Dazhai in agriculture, learn from the People's Liberation Army nationwide, and strengthen political and ideological work,
	* The strategic policy of preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people,
	* The issue of breaking foreign frameworks and forging our own path of industrial development,
	* The issue of the system and layout of economic and national defense construction,
	* The call for the entire Party to focus on military affairs and implement the policy of universal military training,
	* The issue of planning and deploying the gradual mechanization of agriculture,
	* The call for the People's Liberation Army and factories, rural areas, schools, commerce, services, and party and government organs to all become a great school of revolution.

The plenary session emphasized that Comrade Mao Zedong's series of instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are the current guidelines for our cultural revolution and a major development of Marxism-Leninism.

The plenary session believes that the key to successfully carrying out this cultural revolution lies in trusting the masses, relying on the masses, mobilizing the masses, and respecting the masses' spirit of initiative. This requires adhering to the line of "from the masses, to the masses." First, be a student of the masses, and then be a teacher of the masses. Dare to revolutionize and be good at revolutionizing. Do not be afraid of chaos. Oppose standing on the bourgeois standpoint, protecting the rightists, attacking the leftists, and suppressing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Oppose creating many frameworks to bind the hands and feet of the masses. Oppose being an official and a lord, standing above the masses and issuing blind orders.

We must warmly support the revolutionary leftists, strive to unite with all those who can be united, and concentrate our efforts on attacking a handful of anti-party and anti-socialist bourgeois rightists.

The plenary session believes that Comrade Mao Zedong's series of decisions on socialist revolution and socialist construction in the past four years have greatly accelerated the development and victory of our socialist cause, and have profound significance for consolidating our proletarian dictatorship and socialist system, preventing revisionism from usurping the leadership of the Party and the state, preventing capitalist restoration, ensuring that our country firmly adheres to proletarian internationalism, actively supports the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries, and ensures that our country will gradually transition to communism in the future.

International

The Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee believes that the current situation of Marxists-Leninists and revolutionary people around the world fighting against imperialism, reactionaries in various countries, and modern revisionism is excellent. We are now in a new era of world revolution. Various political forces are undergoing a great upheaval, great division, and great reorganization. The revolutionary movements of the people in various countries, especially in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, are flourishing. Although the development of the international situation will inevitably encounter various twists and turns, the general trend of imperialism heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism heading towards global victory is unchangeable. The brutal suppression, frenzied attacks, and bribery and deception of the revolutionary masses by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in various countries cannot save their doomed fate; instead, they will further promote the revolutionary awakening of the people in various countries. The counter-revolutionary activities of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in various countries are promoting the revolutionary activities of the people in various countries. U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in various countries appear strong but are actually very weak. In the long run, they are all paper tigers.

The new leadership of the CPSU, inheriting the legacy of Khrushchev, practices Khrushchev-style revisionism without Khrushchev. Their line is to maintain the rule of imperialism and colonialism in the capitalist world and to carry out capitalist restoration in the socialist world. The CPSU leadership has betrayed Marxism-Leninism, betrayed the great Lenin, betrayed the great October Revolution, betrayed proletarian internationalism, betrayed the revolutionary cause of the international proletariat and oppressed peoples and nations, and betrayed the interests of the great Soviet people and the people of socialist countries. They curse the Communist Party of China as "dogmatism," "sectarianism," and "leftist adventurism," but what they attack is precisely Marxism-Leninism. They are joining forces with the imperialists led by the United States and the reactionaries in various countries to form a new Holy Alliance against communism, against the people, against revolution, and against China. However, this counter-revolutionary Holy Alliance is doomed to failure and is already in a state of disintegration.

The plenary session believes that our Party's comprehensive and open criticism of Khrushchev revisionism in recent years is completely correct and necessary. The "Suggestions on the General Line of the International Communist Movement" proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on June 14, 1963, is a programmatic document. This document, formulated under the personal leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, together with the nine commentaries by the editorial departments of the People's Daily and Red Flag magazine on the open letter from the Central Committee of the CPSU, "Critique of the Moscow March Meeting," and Comrade Lin Biao's article "Long Live the Victory of People's War," has provided a scientific Marxist-Leninist analysis of a series of major issues in contemporary world revolution. These are powerful ideological weapons against imperialism and modern revisionism.

The plenary session believes that to oppose imperialism, one must oppose modern revisionism. In the struggle between Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism, there is no middle ground. We must draw a clear line with the modern revisionist group centered on the CPSU leadership, resolutely expose their true faces as renegades, and it is impossible to engage in any "joint actions" with them.

The plenary session pointed out that proletarian internationalism is the highest guiding principle of our foreign policy. The plenary session warmly supports the just struggles of the people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism led by the United States and its lackeys, and supports the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries.

The plenary session strongly condemns the crimes of U.S. imperialism in expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam. The plenary session strongly and resolutely supports Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to the Entire Nation," firmly supports the Vietnamese people in fighting to the end until they achieve the final victory in the anti-American national salvation war. The plenary session fully agrees with all the measures and actions that have been taken and will be taken by our Party Central Committee and our government in consultation with the Vietnamese side to aid Vietnam in resisting America.

The plenary session strongly condemns the two-faced policy of the Soviet revisionist leadership in the issue of Vietnam's resistance against America, which is fake support and real betrayal.

The plenary session believes that U.S. imperialism is the most vicious common enemy of the people of the world. To isolate and strike U.S. imperialism to the greatest extent, we must establish the broadest possible international united front against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. The Soviet revisionist leadership pursues a policy of Soviet-American cooperation to dominate the world, engages in splitting, sabotaging, and subverting activities in the international communist movement and national liberation movement, and actively serves U.S. imperialism. They are certainly not included in this united front.

We must unite with all anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist people in the world to carry the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys to the end.

We must unite with all revolutionary Marxists-Leninists in the world to carry the struggle against modern revisionism to the end and push the revolutionary cause of the international proletariat and the people of the world forward.

Highly Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought

The Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee emphasized that the entire Party and the entire country studying the works of Comrade Mao Zedong is a major event of historical significance. Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Comrade Mao Zedong has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage. Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards global victory. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all work of the entire Party and the entire country. The plenary session believes that Comrade Lin Biao's call for the People's Liberation Army to launch a mass movement to study the works of Comrade Mao Zedong throughout the army has set a brilliant example for the entire Party and the entire country. Arm the workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and cadres with Mao Zedong Thought, further promote the ideological revolution of the people, and this is the most reliable and fundamental guarantee to prevent revisionism, prevent capitalist restoration, and ensure the victory of our socialist and communist cause. The method of studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works with questions in mind, studying and applying them actively, combining study and use, learning first what is urgently needed, and seeing immediate results in practice is effective, universally applicable, and should be further promoted throughout the Party and the country.

The Communist Party of China is a great, glorious, and correct party. Our Party is the party founded and cultivated by Comrade Mao Zedong, a party armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Our Party is a vanguard party of the proletariat that combines theory with practice, closely links with the masses, and has a serious spirit of self-criticism. Our Party is a proletarian revolutionary party that has gone through the most intense, arduous, long-term, and complex struggles in history. Our people are great people. Our country is a great country. Our army is a great army. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China, the people of the entire country will be self-reliant and strive to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, fulfill the mission entrusted to us by history, and will not disappoint the expectations of the revolutionary people of the world.

The Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee calls on the workers, members of the people's communes, soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary intellectuals, revolutionary teachers and students, and scientific and technological personnel to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite with all those who can be united, overcome obstacles from all directions of counter-revolutionary revisionism and "left" and "right" opportunism, overcome difficulties, overcome shortcomings, overcome errors, overcome the dark sides within the Party and society, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, carry the socialist revolution to the end, strive for the realization of the Third Five-Year Plan, and strive to build our country into a powerful socialist country.

We must have the great ambition of the proletariat, dare to tread paths where no one has gone before, and dare to scale peaks where no one has climbed before. We must build a socialist China that accounts for one-fourth of the world's population into an iron fortress of the proletariat that will never change color. We must liberate Taiwan. We must be one hundred times more vigilant and prevent sudden attacks by U.S. imperialism and its accomplices. If they dare to impose war on us, the seven hundred million Chinese people under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China will definitely break their backs and thoroughly, completely, and utterly annihilate them.
