The Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was held in Beijing from August 1 to 12, 1966. The session was presided over by Comrade Mao Zedong. Members and alternate members of the Central Committee attended the meeting. Comrades from the Central Bureau and the Party Committees of provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, members of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, comrades from relevant departments of the Central Committee, and representatives of revolutionary teachers and students from universities in the capital attended the meeting as non-voting delegates.

The Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee discussed and adopted the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

The plenary session reviewed and approved the major decisions and measures on domestic and international issues made by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee since the Tenth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee in September 1962.

Domestic

Comrade Mao Zedong made a correct analysis of the situation at the Tenth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and once again emphasized the theory of contradictions, classes, and class struggle in socialist society. This serves as a guide for our socialist revolution and socialist construction. Over the past four years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, and guided by the general line of building socialism with great, daring, and pioneering spirit, and with high speed, good quality, and low cost, our people have launched the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, achieving great victories. The people's communes have been further consolidated and developed. The country is brimming with revolutionary fervor, and a new all-around leap forward is on the horizon.

Our national economy is developing steadily and healthily. The policy of adjustment, consolidation, enrichment, and improvement proposed by the Party Central Committee has been successfully implemented. Starting from this year, the Third Five-Year Plan has been put into effect. On the industrial front, not only the quantity of products but also the variety, quality, and standards have seen significant improvements. In agriculture, good harvests have been achieved for four consecutive years. The market is thriving, and prices are stable. The success of the three nuclear tests has demonstrated the new level of our scientific and technological development and industrial progress.

In recent years, extensive socialist education movements have been carried out in rural areas, cities, and the military across the country. Now, an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is sweeping across our country. The movement of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and cadres studying and applying Comrade Mao Zedong's works has opened a new era for the laboring people to directly grasp and apply Marxism-Leninism.

The plenary session fully agrees with the "Draft Decision on Several Current Issues in Rural Work" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on May 20, 1963, and fully agrees with the minutes of the national work conference convened by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on January 14, 1965: "Some Current Issues in the Socialist Education Movement in Rural Areas," known as the "Twenty-Three Articles." These two documents, formulated under the personal leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, are powerful ideological weapons for the Chinese people to carry out the socialist revolution. In rural areas and cities, we should continue to follow these two documents, in conjunction with the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to carry out the "Four Cleans" movement, that is, the socialist education movement to clean up politics, ideology, organization, and economics, to the end.

The plenary session fully agrees with the series of wise decisions made by Comrade Mao Zedong in the past four years. These decisions mainly include:

	* The issue of implementing the principle of democratic centralism and carrying forward the revolutionary tradition of the mass line,
	* The issue of cultivating and training successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause,
	* The call to learn from Daqing in industry, learn from Dazhai in agriculture, learn from the People's Liberation Army nationwide, and strengthen political and ideological work,
	* The strategic policy of preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people,
	* The issue of breaking foreign frameworks and forging our own path of industrial development,
	* The issue of the system and layout of economic and national defense construction,
	* The call for the entire Party to focus on military affairs and implement the policy of universal military training,
	* The issue of planning and deploying the gradual mechanization of agriculture,
	* The call for the People's Liberation Army and factories, rural areas, schools, commerce, services, and party and government organs to all become a great school of revolution.

The plenary session emphasized that Comrade Mao Zedong's series of instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are the current guidelines for our cultural revolution and a major development of Marxism-Leninism.

The plenary session believes that the key to successfully carrying out this cultural revolution lies in trusting the masses, relying on the masses, mobilizing the masses, and respecting the masses' spirit of initiative. This requires adhering to the line of "from the masses, to the masses." First, be a student of the masses, and then be a teacher of the masses. Dare to revolutionize and be good at revolutionizing. Do not be afraid of chaos. Oppose standing on the bourgeois standpoint, protecting the rightists, attacking the leftists, and suppressing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Oppose creating many frameworks to bind the hands and feet of the masses. Oppose being an official and a lord, standing above the masses and issuing blind orders.

We must warmly support the revolutionary leftists, strive to unite with all those who can be united, and concentrate our efforts on attacking a handful of anti-party and anti-socialist bourgeois rightists.

The plenary session believes that Comrade Mao Zedong's series of decisions on socialist revolution and socialist construction in the past four years have greatly accelerated the development and victory of our socialist cause, and have profound significance for consolidating our proletarian dictatorship and socialist system, preventing revisionism from usurping the leadership of the Party and the state, preventing capitalist restoration, ensuring that our country firmly adheres to proletarian internationalism, actively supports the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries, and ensures that our country will gradually transition to communism in the future.

International

The Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee believes that the current situation of Marxists-Leninists and revolutionary people around the world fighting against imperialism, reactionaries in various countries, and modern revisionism is excellent. We are now in a new era of world revolution. Various political forces are undergoing a great upheaval, great division, and great reorganization. The revolutionary movements of the people in various countries, especially in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, are flourishing. Although the development of the international situation will inevitably encounter various twists and turns, the general trend of imperialism heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism heading towards global victory is unchangeable. The brutal suppression, frenzied attacks, and bribery and deception of the revolutionary masses by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in various countries cannot save their doomed fate; instead, they will further promote the revolutionary awakening of the people in various countries. The counter-revolutionary activities of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in various countries are promoting the revolutionary activities of the people in various countries. U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in various countries appear strong but are actually very weak. In the long run, they are all paper tigers.

The new leadership of the CPSU, inheriting the legacy of Khrushchev, practices Khrushchev-style revisionism without Khrushchev. Their line is to maintain the rule of imperialism and colonialism in the capitalist world and to carry out capitalist restoration in the socialist world. The CPSU leadership has betrayed Marxism-Leninism, betrayed the great Lenin, betrayed the great October Revolution, betrayed proletarian internationalism, betrayed the revolutionary cause of the international proletariat and oppressed peoples and nations, and betrayed the interests of the great Soviet people and the people of socialist countries. They curse the Communist Party of China as "dogmatism," "sectarianism," and "leftist adventurism," but what they attack is precisely Marxism-Leninism. They are joining forces with the imperialists led by the United States and the reactionaries in various countries to form a new Holy Alliance against communism, against the people, against revolution, and against China. However, this counter-revolutionary Holy Alliance is doomed to failure and is already in a state of disintegration.

The plenary session believes that our Party's comprehensive and open criticism of Khrushchev revisionism in recent years is completely correct and necessary. The "Suggestions on the General Line of the International Communist Movement" proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on June 14, 1963, is a programmatic document. This document, formulated under the personal leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, together with the nine commentaries by the editorial departments of the People's Daily and Red Flag magazine on the open letter from the Central Committee of the CPSU, "Critique of the Moscow March Meeting," and Comrade Lin Biao's article "Long Live the Victory of People's War," has provided a scientific Marxist-Leninist analysis of a series of major issues in contemporary world revolution. These are powerful ideological weapons against imperialism and modern revisionism.

The plenary session believes that to oppose imperialism, one must oppose modern revisionism. In the struggle between Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism, there is no middle ground. We must draw a clear line with the modern revisionist group centered on the CPSU leadership, resolutely expose their true faces as renegades, and it is impossible to engage in any "joint actions" with them.

The plenary session pointed out that proletarian internationalism is the highest guiding principle of our foreign policy. The plenary session warmly supports the just struggles of the people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism led by the United States and its lackeys, and supports the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries.

The plenary session strongly condemns the crimes of U.S. imperialism in expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam. The plenary session strongly and resolutely supports Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to the Entire Nation," firmly supports the Vietnamese people in fighting to the end until they achieve the final victory in the anti-American national salvation war. The plenary session fully agrees with all the measures and actions that have been taken and will be taken by our Party Central Committee and our government in consultation with the Vietnamese side to aid Vietnam in resisting America.

The plenary session strongly condemns the two-faced policy of the Soviet revisionist leadership in the issue of Vietnam's resistance against America, which is fake support and real betrayal.

The plenary session believes that U.S. imperialism is the most vicious common enemy of the people of the world. To isolate and strike U.S. imperialism to the greatest extent, we must establish the broadest possible international united front against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. The Soviet revisionist leadership pursues a policy of Soviet-American cooperation to dominate the world, engages in splitting, sabotaging, and subverting activities in the international communist movement and national liberation movement, and actively serves U.S. imperialism. They are certainly not included in this united front.

We must unite with all anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist people in the world to carry the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys to the end.

We must unite with all revolutionary Marxists-Leninists in the world to carry the struggle against modern revisionism to the end and push the revolutionary cause of the international proletariat and the people of the world forward.

Highly Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought

The Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee emphasized that the entire Party and the entire country studying the works of Comrade Mao Zedong is a major event of historical significance. Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Comrade Mao Zedong has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage. Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards global victory. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all work of the entire Party and the entire country. The plenary session believes that Comrade Lin Biao's call for the People's Liberation Army to launch a mass movement to study the works of Comrade Mao Zedong throughout the army has set a brilliant example for the entire Party and the entire country. Arm the workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and cadres with Mao Zedong Thought, further promote the ideological revolution of the people, and this is the most reliable and fundamental guarantee to prevent revisionism, prevent capitalist restoration, and ensure the victory of our socialist and communist cause. The method of studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works with questions in mind, studying and applying them actively, combining study and use, learning first what is urgently needed, and seeing immediate results in practice is effective, universally applicable, and should be further promoted throughout the Party and the country.

The Communist Party of China is a great, glorious, and correct party. Our Party is the party founded and cultivated by Comrade Mao Zedong, a party armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Our Party is a vanguard party of the proletariat that combines theory with practice, closely links with the masses, and has a serious spirit of self-criticism. Our Party is a proletarian revolutionary party that has gone through the most intense, arduous, long-term, and complex struggles in history. Our people are great people. Our country is a great country. Our army is a great army. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China, the people of the entire country will be self-reliant and strive to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, fulfill the mission entrusted to us by history, and will not disappoint the expectations of the revolutionary people of the world.

The Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee calls on the workers, members of the people's communes, soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary intellectuals, revolutionary teachers and students, and scientific and technological personnel to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite with all those who can be united, overcome obstacles from all directions of counter-revolutionary revisionism and "left" and "right" opportunism, overcome difficulties, overcome shortcomings, overcome errors, overcome the dark sides within the Party and society, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, carry the socialist revolution to the end, strive for the realization of the Third Five-Year Plan, and strive to build our country into a powerful socialist country.

We must have the great ambition of the proletariat, dare to tread paths where no one has gone before, and dare to scale peaks where no one has climbed before. We must build a socialist China that accounts for one-fourth of the world's population into an iron fortress of the proletariat that will never change color. We must liberate Taiwan. We must be one hundred times more vigilant and prevent sudden attacks by U.S. imperialism and its accomplices. If they dare to impose war on us, the seven hundred million Chinese people under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China will definitely break their backs and thoroughly, completely, and utterly annihilate them.

　　中国共产党第八届中央委员会第十一次全体会议公报
　　（一九六六年八月十二日通过）
    中国共产党第八届中央委员会第十一次全体会议，一九六六年八月一日至十二日在北京举行。
    八届十一中全会是在毛泽东同志主持下进行的。中央委员会委员和候补委员出席了会议。各中央局和各省、市、自治区党委的同志，中央文化革命小组的成员，中央有关部门的同志，首都高等院校革命师生的代表，列席了会议。
    八届十一中全会讨论并通过了《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》。
    全会讨论和批准了一九六二年九月八届十中全会以来中央政治局关于国内和国际问题的重大决策和重大措施。
    国内
    毛泽东同志在八届十中全会上对当时的形势作了正确的分析，再一次强调了关于社会主义社会的矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争的理论。这是我国进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的指南。近四年来，我国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的领导下，在党的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的指引下，展开了阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动，取得了伟大胜利。人民公社得到了进一步巩固和发展。全国到处是一片热气腾腾的革命景象，正在出现新的全面跃进的局面。
    我国的国民经济正在持续地健康地向前发展。党中央提出的调整、巩固、充实、提高的方针，已经胜利实现。从今年起，开始实行第三个五年计划。在工业战线上，不但产品的数量，而且品种，质量，都有了很大的发展和提高。在农业战线上，连续四年获得了好收成。市场繁荣，物价稳定。三次核试验的成功，集中表现了我国科学技术和工业发展的新水平。
    近几年来，在全国的农村、城市和军队，广泛地展开了社会主义教育运动。现在，一个史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，正在我国兴起。工农兵群众、革命知识分子和广大干部活学活用毛泽东同志著作的群众运动，开创了劳动人民直接掌握和运用马克思列宁主义的新纪元。
    全会完全同意一九六三年五月二十日《中共中央关于目前农村工作中若干问题的决定（草案）》，完全同意一九六五年一月十四日中共中央政治局召集的全国工作会议讨论纪要：《农村社会主义教育运动中目前提出的一些问题》，即二十三条。这两个文件，是在毛泽东同志亲自领导下制定的，是我国人民进行社会主义革命的强大的思想武器。在农村和城市，应该继续按照这两个文件，结合无产阶级文化大革命，把“四清”运动，也就是清政治、清思想、清组织、清经济的社会主义教育运动，进行到底。
    全会完全同意毛泽东同志近四年提出的一系列英明决策。这些决策主要的是：
    关于贯彻执行民主集中制的原则，发扬群众路线的革命传统的问题，
    关于培养和造就无产阶级革命事业接班人的问题，
    关于工业学大庆，农业学大寨，全国学人民解放军，加强政治思想工作的号召，
    关于备战、备荒、为人民的战略方针，
    关于打破洋框框，走自己工业发展道路的问题，
    关于经济建设和国防建设的体系和布局的问题，
    关于全党抓军事，实行全民皆兵的号召，
    关于逐步实现农业机械化的规划和部署的问题，
    关于人民解放军和工厂、农村、学校、商业、服务行业、党政机关，都应该成为一个革命化的大学校的号召。
    全会强调指出，毛泽东同志关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列指示，是当前我国文化革命的行动指南，是马克思列宁主义的一个重大发展。
    全会认为，搞好这场文化大革命，关键在于信任群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，尊重群众的首创精神。这就必须坚持从群众中来，到群众中去的路线。先当群众的学生，后当群众的先生。要敢于革命，善于革命。不要怕出乱子。反对站在资产阶级立场，包庇右派，打击左派，压制无产阶级文化大革命。反对制造许多框框，束缚群众的手脚。反对做官当老爷，站在群众头上瞎指挥。
    要热烈支持革命的左派，注意争取团结一切可以团结的人们，集中力量打击一小撮反党反社会主义的资产阶级右派分子。
    全会认为，毛泽东同志在近四年提出的关于社会主义革命和社会主义建设的一系列问题，大大加快我国社会主义事业的发展和胜利，对于巩固我国的无产阶级专政和社会主义制度，防止修正主义篡夺党和国家的领导，防止资本主义复辟，保证我国坚持无产阶级国际主义，积极支持世界各国人民的革命斗争，保证我国将来逐步过渡到共产主义，具有极为深远的意义。
    国际
    八届十一中全会认为，当前全世界马克思列宁主义者和革命人民反对帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义的斗争，形势是大好的。当前正处在世界革命的一个新时代。各种政治力量正在经历着一个大动荡、大分化、大改组的局面。各国人民的革命运动，特别是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的革命运动，正在蓬勃发展。尽管国际形势的发展不可避免地会出现各种曲折和反复，但是，帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的总趋势，是改变不了的。美帝国主义及其在各国的走狗对革命群众的残酷镇压、疯狂进攻和收买欺骗，都不能挽救他们灭亡的命运，相反，只能进一步地促进各国人民的革命觉醒。美帝国主义及其在各国的走狗所进行的反人民反革命的活动，正在促进各国人民的革命活动。美帝国主义及其在各国的走狗，貌似强大，实际上是很虚弱的。从长远看来，他们都是纸老虎。
    苏共新领导集团，继承赫鲁晓夫的衣钵，实行没有赫鲁晓夫的赫鲁晓夫修正主义。他们的路线就是，在资本主义世界维护帝国主义、殖民主义的统治，在社会主义世界实行资本主义复辟。苏共领导集团背叛了马克思列宁主义，背叛了伟大的列宁，背叛了伟大的十月革命的道路，背叛了无产阶级国际主义，背叛了国际无产阶级和被压迫人民、被压迫民族的革命事业，背叛了伟大的苏联人民和社会主义各国人民的利益。他们咒骂中国共产党是什么“教条主义”、“宗派主义”、“左倾冒险主义”，其实，他们所攻击的恰恰是马克思列宁主义。他们正在联合以美国为首的帝国主义和各国反动派，结成一个反共、反人民、反革命、反中国的新神圣同盟。可是，这种反革命的神圣同盟，是注定要破产的，现在已经陷于分崩离析。
    全会认为，近几年来，我们党对赫鲁晓夫修正主义所进行的全面的公开的批判，是完全正确的，完全必要的。一九六三年六月十四日中共中央提出的《关于国际共产主义运动总路线的建议》，是一个纲领性文献。在毛泽东同志亲自领导下制定的这个文件，和《人民日报》《红旗》杂志编辑部对苏共中央公开信的九篇评论，《评莫斯科三月会议》，以及林彪同志《人民战争胜利万岁》的文章等等，对当代世界革命一系列重大问题，做了马克思列宁主义的科学分析，是反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的强大思想武器。
    全会认为，要反对帝国主义，就必须反对现代修正主义。在马克思列宁主义同现代修正主义的斗争中，决没有中间道路可走。对于以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义集团，必须划清界限，坚决揭露他们工贼的真面目，不可能同他们搞什么“联合行动”。
    全会指出，无产阶级国际主义，是我国对外政策的最高指导原则。全会热烈支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗的正义斗争，支持全世界各国人民的革命斗争。
    全会最强烈地谴责美帝国主义扩大侵略越南战争的罪行。全会最热烈、最坚决地支持越南民主共和国主席胡志明同志的《告全国同胞书》，坚决支持越南人民打到底，直到取得抗美救国战争的最后胜利。全会完全同意我党中央和我国政府同越南方面商定的关于援越抗美的一切已经采取的措施和将要采取的行动。
    全会强烈谴责苏联修正主义领导集团在越南抗美斗争的问题上，执行假支持、真出卖的反革命两面政策。
    全会认为，美帝国主义是全世界人民最凶恶的共同敌人。为了最大限度地孤立和打击美帝国主义，必须建立反对美帝国主义及其走狗的最广泛的国际统一战线。苏联修正主义领导集团奉行苏美合作主宰世界的政策，在国际共产主义运动和民族解放运动中，进行分裂、破坏和颠覆活动，积极为美帝国主义效劳。他们当然不包括在这个统一战线之内。
    我们一定要联合世界上一切反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义的人们，把反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争进行到底。
    我们一定要同全世界一切革命的马克思列宁主义者一道，把反对现代修正主义的斗争进行到底，把国际无产阶级和世界人民的革命事业推向前进。
    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗
    八届十一中全会强调指出，全党全国大学毛泽东同志著作，是一个具有历史意义的重大事件。毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东同志天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是全党全国一切工作的指导方针。全会认为，林彪同志号召人民解放军在全军展开学习毛泽东同志著作的群众运动，为全党全国树立了光辉的榜样。用毛泽东思想武装工农兵群众、革命知识分子和广大干部，进一步促进人的思想革命化，是防止修正主义，防止资本主义复辟，使我们社会主义和共产主义事业取得胜利的最可靠、最根本的保证。对毛泽东同志著作，带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在用字上狠下功夫的方法，是行之有效的，普遍适用的，应当进一步在全党全国推广。
    中国共产党，是伟大的、光荣的、正确的党。我们的党，是毛泽东同志缔造和培育的党，是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的党。我们的党，是理论和实际相结合的、和人民群众紧密地联系在一起的、有认真的自我批评精神的无产阶级先锋队。我们的党，是经历了历史上最激烈、最艰苦、最长期、最复杂的斗争的无产阶级革命党。我们的人民是伟大的人民。我们的国家是伟大的国家。我们的军队是伟大的军队。我们坚信，在伟大的领袖毛泽东同志和中国共产党的领导下，全国军民自力更生，奋发图强，一定能够战胜一切困难和障碍，一定能够完成历史赋予我们的使命，一定不辜负世界革命人民对我们的期望。
    八届十一中全会号召全国工人、人民公社社员、人民解放军指战员、革命干部、革命知识分子、革命师生、科学技术人员，更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，团结一切可以团结的人们，克服从反革命修正主义和“左”右倾机会主义诸方面来的阻力，克服困难，克服缺点，克服错误，克服党内和社会上的阴暗面，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把社会主义革命进行到底，为实现第三个五年计划，为把我国建设成为一个强大的社会主义国家而奋斗。
    我们一定要有无产阶级的雄心壮志，敢于走前人没有走过的道路，敢于攀登前人没有攀登过的高峰。我们一定要把占世界人口四分之一的社会主义中国建设好，使它成为无产阶级的铁打的江山，永不变色。我们一定要解放台湾。我们一定要百倍地提高警惕，防止美帝国主义及其帮凶的突然袭击。如果它们胆敢把战争强加在我们头上，在毛泽东同志和中国共产党领导下的七亿中国人民，就一定要打断侵略者的脊骨，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地把它们消灭掉。
