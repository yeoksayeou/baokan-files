The Beijing Workers' Gymnasium, where the International Table Tennis Invitational is being held, has a particularly eye-catching team of workers. These young people, who appear to be under twenty years old, wear work badges on their chests and are busy running around inside and outside the gymnasium all day. They carry Chairman Mao's works with them, and their words and actions are all guided by Mao Zedong Thought. Although the spectators cannot call out the names of these workers, they can see from their bright red armbands the three striking characters: Red Guards!

"We are here to make revolution!"

On the afternoon of the opening day of the invitational, dozens of spirited Red Guard warriors gathered under the shade of trees outside the Workers' Gymnasium, standing in neat rows. Each person held a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and they read aloud the teachings of our great leader Mao Zedong:

"White was selfless and dedicated to the welfare of others. He was utterly devoted to his work and to the people. Every Communist should learn from him." ...

These are the Red Guard warriors who are about to enter the gymnasium to carry out their tasks, expressing their revolutionary resolve to the Party and to Chairman Mao.

These young students from the Communist Labor School (formerly Beijing Industrial School) and the White School (formerly Beijing Medical School) are all revolutionary vanguards who have been at the forefront of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They are determined to test and temper themselves in the great waves of class struggle. Therefore, when they were first assigned to serve the invitational, some of them hesitated. Later, these revolutionary youngsters, with their ideological questions, turned to Chairman Mao's books for guidance. They came to understand that successfully organizing the invitational is of great significance for promoting the unity of the people of the world in opposing imperialism. Thus, they stood tall and clenched their fists, resolutely taking on this glorious task. The young Red Guard warriors waved their fists and declared:

"Red Guard warriors are all revolutionary vanguards! We are not here to watch the games; we are here to make revolution!"

"We will use our actions to declare to all of China and the world: With the great commander Mao Zedong leading us and armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought, we Red Guard warriors can do anything and do it well!"

In the gymnasium, sweeping away the "Four Olds"

"We are the critics of the old world, and we are the masters of the new world. We will sweep away all the garbage left over from the old society, and let the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought occupy every position." The Red Guards assigned to serve the invitational, with this revolutionary spirit, changed many of the old systems, old customs, and old styles that had been left over in the competition hall, rest rooms, and ticket offices, making the entire Workers' Gymnasium a place where one can see pictures of our great leader Mao Zedong everywhere and see the instructions of our great leader Mao Zedong everywhere, adding boundless splendor to this International Table Tennis Invitational.

On their first day at the gymnasium, they actively proposed revolutionary suggestions to the staff: requiring that every room and every position should hang a portrait of our beloved leader Mao Zedong, and post quotations from Chairman Mao, using Mao Zedong Thought to ensure the smooth conduct of this competition. Their suggestions were warmly responded to by the workers, who said, "The Red Guards have spoken our hearts' desires. For many years, we have wanted to hang a portrait of great leader Mao Zedong in the gymnasium, but the black gang members of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee did everything they could to prevent it. Today, our wish has been fulfilled, and we workers are truly happy from the bottom of our hearts." Under the influence of the Red Guards, the staff inside and outside the venue study the bright red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" every day together with the Red Guards. Under the influence of the Red Guards, almost all the spectators who came to watch the competition also brought the shining red "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Many spectators reflected that the gymnasium is now completely different from before. On the court, not only did they see the exquisite ball skills of the athletes from various countries, but they also received a good education in Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction; without removal, there can be no flow; without stopping, there can be no progress." The Red Guards, following Chairman Mao's teachings, discovered that there were still many old systems, old customs, and old styles in the gymnasium, and they suggested reforms. They found that the old ticket-selling method in the ticket office was not convenient for workers, peasants, and soldiers, but only benefited those who were idle and had money. They immediately proposed that this time, tickets must have certain procedures to ensure that workers, peasants, and soldiers are given priority. They also proposed canceling the old "complimentary tickets" and not allowing "backdoor" ticket sales. They also changed the sign "Peace Gate" at the exit of the competition hall to "Revolutionary Gate" with red paper. The revolutionary actions of the Red Guards were warmly welcomed by the staff inside and outside the gymnasium and by the workers, peasants, and soldiers who came to watch the competition.

"Propagating Mao Zedong Thought is our most glorious task!"

"Propagating Mao Zedong Thought is our most glorious task!"

This is a common slogan of the Red Guards participating in the invitational work. The young warriors, full of revolutionary passion, love Mao Zedong Thought the most and are also active propagators of Mao Zedong Thought.

During the rest time of the competition, more and more spectators gathered in the East Gate rest hall, including many foreign friends. Several Red Guards from the Beijing Communist Labor School immediately opened their books and began to read aloud: "After the armed enemies have been wiped out, the unarmed enemies still exist..." The clear reading attracted many people. They immediately gathered around and also opened their books to review Chairman Mao's teachings. Several other Red Guards from different units enthusiastically joined their ranks and read aloud with them. The boundless love, respect, and admiration of the great masses for the great leader made the emotions of the people in the rest hall more and more excited, and the number of people participating in the reading increased, with loud voices echoing throughout the hall. After reading a few passages, under the initiative of the Red Guards, everyone sang "The Boat Sails on the Sea Relying on the Helm" together. At this time, the resounding song "Revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought" echoed throughout the venue with rhythmic applause, inspiring the revolutionary spirit and encouraging the revolutionary will of the people. Many foreign friends in the venue also could not help but sing with the great masses our great teacher, our beloved leader Mao Zedong.

In the South Gate corridor, two female Red Guards held the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," sometimes reading a passage to the spectators who had just entered the door, and sometimes reading a passage to the comrades who bought Chairman Mao's works at the temporary bookstore of the New China News Agency. Before reading the quotations, they always chanted together, "The boat sails on the sea relying on the helm, all things grow relying on the sun, revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." In the corridor, in the rest room, on the stands of the competition hall, whenever there was an opportunity, the Red Guards read the quotations of Chairman Mao to the spectators and led the spectators to sing the praises of Mao Zedong Thought.

The Red Guards participating in this invitational work all carry the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with them. The young warriors said passionately, "We must resolutely do this: Where there are Red Guards, there is the voice of revolutionary rebellion; where there are Red Guards, there is the voice of propagating Mao Zedong Thought!"

Like the PLA in carrying out missions

Learning from the PLA is the call of our most beloved Chairman Mao. The Red Guards serving the International Table Tennis Invitational resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great directive, love the PLA, and learn from the PLA.

In the gymnasium, they are like the PLA, seizing every opportunity to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and working hard on their language. In the past few days, they specially studied the quotations "Class and Class Struggle," "Serve the People," and "Discipline," and they also reviewed the "Sixteen Points" formulated under Chairman Mao's personal guidance. They said they would definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings and the spirit of the "Sixteen Points" to solve various problems encountered in carrying out their missions.

The Red Guards, taking the PLA as an example, resolutely carry out the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention formulated by Chairman Mao, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide all their actions. Among them, many are table tennis enthusiasts. In such a world-renowned international competition, they are so eager to see the exquisite performances of the famous athletes with their own eyes! But when they think of Chairman Mao's teachings, think of the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, and think of the great responsibility they bear, they dispel all distractions and happily stand guard at their posts.

Now the competition has been going on for several days. The Red Guards on duty outside the venue have become accustomed to the cheers and applause. No matter how exciting the competition is inside the venue, or how enthusiastic the applause is, it cannot affect their normal performance of their duties. Some Red Guards guard the gate where they cannot even hear the applause, and they happily continue their work, like the PLA, loyal to the revolutionary cause, wholeheartedly serving the people.

    “我们红卫兵是新世界的主人！”
     ——记为北京国际乒乓球邀请赛服务的红卫兵小将
    正在举行国际乒乓球邀请赛的北京工人体育馆，有一支特别引人注目的工作人员队伍。这些看上去不满二十岁的年轻人，胸前佩着工作证，整天在体育馆内外忙碌奔波。他们随身带着毛主席著作，话不离毛主席语录，做事不离毛泽东思想。观众虽然叫不出这些工作人员的名字，却从他们鲜红的袖章上看到了三个醒目的大字：红卫兵！
    “我们是来革命的！”
    在邀请赛开幕那天下午，几十名雄赳赳、气昂昂的红卫兵战士聚集在工人体育馆外的树荫下，排着整齐的队形，人手一册《毛主席语录》，一字一句地在集体朗读我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导：
      “白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。每个共产党员都要学习他。”……
    这是即将进入体育馆执行任务的红卫兵战士在向党、向毛主席表达自己的革命决心。
    来自共产主义劳动学校（原北京工业学校）和白求恩学校（原北京卫生学校）的这些年青学生，在学校里都是在无产阶级文化大革命中冲锋陷阵的革命闯将。他们一心一意要在这场阶级斗争的大风大浪中使自己经受更多的考验和锻炼。因此，开始调他们来为邀请赛服务的时候，有些人犹豫起来了。后来，这批革命小将带着自己的思想问题向毛主席的书请教，认识到搞好邀请赛对于促进世界人民的团结反帝事业有着重大意义，于是一个个挺胸握拳，坚决把这个光荣的任务承担了下来，年轻的红卫兵战士们挥着拳头表示：
    “红卫兵战士都是革命的闯将！我们到体育馆不是为了看球，我们是来革命的！”
      “我们要用自己的行动，向全中国全世界宣布：有伟大统帅毛主席的指挥，有伟大的毛泽东思想来武装，我们红卫兵战士什么都能干，什么都可以干好！”
     在体育馆里扫“四旧”
    “我们是旧世界的批判者，我们是新世界的主人。我们要把旧社会遗留下来的一切垃圾打扫得干干净净，让伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想占领一切阵地。”担任邀请赛服务工作的红卫兵们，一进体育馆就以这种革命精神改掉了比赛场内、休息厅里、售票室前许多过去遗留下来的旧制度、旧习惯、旧作风，使整个工人体育馆到处都能看到我们伟大领袖毛主席的像片，到处都能见到我们伟大领袖毛主席的指示，为这次国际乒乓球邀请赛增添了无限光彩。
    他们来到体育馆的第一天，就积极向场地职工提出革命化的建议：要求各房间、各部位都要挂上最敬爱的领袖毛主席的像，贴上毛主席语录，要用毛泽东思想来保证这次比赛顺利进行。他们的建议得到了职工们的热烈响应，工人们说，红卫兵们说出了我们的心里话，多少年来，我们就想把伟大领袖毛主席的像挂在体育馆里，可是，过去盘踞在这里的前北京市委的黑帮走卒，千方百计地阻止挂毛主席的像。今天，我们的心愿实现了，我们工人真是从心眼里高兴。在红卫兵的带动下，场内外的工作人员每天都拿出鲜红的《毛主席语录》，同红卫兵们一起坚持学习。在红卫兵的影响下，前来观看比赛的人也几乎都带上了红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》。许多观众反映，现在的体育馆与过去大不相同，在球场上，不仅看到了各国选手们的精湛球艺，同时也受到了一次很好的毛泽东思想的教育。
    毛主席教导我们：“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行。”红卫兵们本着毛主席这一教导，发现体育馆还有许多旧制度、旧习惯、旧作风，并且建议加以改革。他们在售票室发现过去的售票办法很不利于工农兵观众，只方便了那些有钱而又游手好闲的人，他们就立即提出建议，这次售票必须有一定的手续，以便优先卖给工农兵。要取消过去的“赠票”，买票不许“走后门”。他们还把比赛大厅出口的“太平门”字样，用红纸改成了“革命门”。红卫兵的这些革命行动，受到了体育馆内外工作人员和工农兵观众的热烈欢迎。
    “宣传毛泽东思想是我们最光荣的任务！”
    “宣传毛泽东思想是我们最光荣的任务！”
    这是参加邀请赛工作的红卫兵们的一句共同的豪言壮语。满怀革命激情的小将们，最最热爱毛泽东思想，也是毛泽东思想的积极传播者。
    在比赛休息时间里，东门休息厅的观众越聚越多，其中还有许多外国朋友。几个北京共产主义劳动学校的红卫兵，马上打开语录高声宣读起来：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在……”，清晰的朗读声吸引了许多群众。他们立即围拢来也跟着打开语录重温起毛主席的教导。一些其他单位的红卫兵，则踊跃加入他们的队伍，和他们一起齐声宣读。广大群众对伟大领袖的无限热爱、无限敬仰、无限崇拜，使休息厅里人们的情绪越来越激昂，参加朗读的人越来越多，宏亮的声音震响着整个大厅。读完了几段语录以后，在红卫兵们的倡议下大家又一起高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，这时，“干革命靠的是毛泽东思想”的嘹亮歌声随着有节奏的鼓掌声响彻全场，激励着人们的革命豪情，鼓舞着人们的革命斗志。在场的许多外国朋友也情不自禁地同广大群众一起歌唱我们伟大的导师、我们敬爱的领袖毛主席。
    在南门走廊里，两个女红卫兵拿着《毛主席语录》，一会儿到入口处给刚进门的观众念一段，一会儿又到新华书店临时售书站给买毛主席著作的同志们念一段。在念语录以前，她们总要齐声朗诵一遍“大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳，干革命靠的是毛泽东思想”。在走廊里、在休息室内，在比赛大厅的看台上，一有机会红卫兵们就到处给观众朗读毛主席语录，领导观众高唱毛泽东思想的赞歌。
    参加这次邀请赛工作的红卫兵们，人人都随身带着《毛主席语录》，小战士们充满激情地说：“我们一定要坚决做到：哪里有我们红卫兵，哪里就有革命造反的声音；哪里有我们红卫兵，哪里就有宣传毛泽东思想的声音！”
    像解放军那样执行任务
    向解放军学习，这是我们最敬爱的毛主席发出的号召。为国际乒乓球邀请赛服务的红卫兵们，坚决执行毛主席的这一伟大指示，热爱解放军，学习解放军。
    在体育馆里，他们就像解放军那样，抓住一切机会活学活用毛主席著作，在用字上狠下功夫。这几天他们特意学习了“阶级和阶级斗争”“为人民服务”“纪律”等三节语录，还重新学习了在毛主席亲自主持下制定的十六条。他们表示，一定要按照毛主席的教导，按照十六条的精神，解决在执行任务中碰到的各种问题。
    红卫兵以解放军为榜样，坚决执行毛主席制定的三大纪律八项注意，用毛泽东思想指导自己的一切行动。他们之中，有不少人是乒乓球爱好者。在这样举世瞩目的国际比赛中，他们是多么想亲眼看看著名选手们的精采表演啊！可是当想到毛主席的教导，想到三大纪律八项注意，想到自己责任的重大，他们就消除一切杂念，心情愉快地坚守在自己的岗位上。
    现在比赛已经进行了好几天，在场外执行任务的红卫兵对于掌声、欢呼声已经习以为常了，不管场内比赛场面多么精采，也不管场内掌声多么热烈，都不能影响他们正常地执行任务。有些红卫兵守卫在连掌声也听不到的大门口，同样愉快地坚持工作，像解放军那样忠于革命事业，全心全意为人民服务。　（新华社记者）
