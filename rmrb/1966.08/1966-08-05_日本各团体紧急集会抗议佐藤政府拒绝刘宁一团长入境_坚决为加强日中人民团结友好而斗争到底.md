Japanese organizations hold emergency meeting to protest Sato government's refusal to allow Liu Ningyi to enter the country
Firmly struggle to the end for strengthening solidarity and friendship between the peoples of Japan and China

	NEW DELHI, Aug. 3 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from various sectors of Japan held an emergency meeting in Tokyo on the evening of August 2 to protest the Japanese government's brazen refusal to allow Liu Ningyi, head of the Chinese delegation, to enter Japan to attend the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs.

	This emergency protest meeting was jointly organized by 15 organizations, including the Japan-China Friendship Association, the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, the Japan-China Trade Promotion Association, the Japan Foreign Trade Council, the Parliamentary League for the Promotion of Sino-Japanese Trade, the National Assembly Members' League for the Promotion of International Trade, the Committee for the Repatriation of Chinese People, the Committee for the Commemoration of Chinese War Dead, the Japan-China Buddhist Exchange Conference, the Japan-China Friendship Association, the Japan Press Club, the Japan National Rescue Association, the Japan Youth Lawyers Association, and the Japan-China Trade Association. More than 840 representatives from various Japanese mass organizations and friendly trading companies attended the meeting. Shiraishi Bampo, a standing director of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association and chairman of the Japan PEN Club, as well as representatives from the political, economic, women's, and youth sectors, spoke at the meeting. They unanimously condemned and protested the Japanese government's unreasonable refusal to allow Liu Ningyi to enter the country.

	The meeting unanimously adopted a resolution stating, "The government's refusal to allow Liu Ningyi to enter the country is a blatant attempt to sabotage Sino-Japanese relations." The resolution pointed out, "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' response to the statement issued by Sun Pinghua, the chief representative of the Liaison Office of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries in Tokyo, which proposed 'deportation' and other measures, is an attempt to further deteriorate Sino-Japanese relations."

	The resolution pointed out that the Japanese government's series of actions are "in line with the U.S. policy of gradually expanding the war of aggression in Vietnam and the gradual expansion of the policy of hostility towards China."

	The resolution said, "We do not want to repeat the tragedy of the 'Nagasaki Flag Incident,' which led to the interruption of Sino-Japanese relations." The resolution said, "The current situation is indeed a struggle between war and peace, between hostility towards China and Sino-Japanese friendship; this situation has plunged Sino-Japanese friendship and various exchanges between the two peoples into an unprecedented crisis."

	The resolution finally expressed firm opposition to the revival of Japanese militarism that participates in the war policy of U.S. imperialism and the Sato government's intensified policy of hostility towards China, and protested the refusal to allow Liu Ningyi to enter the country. The resolution said, "We will firmly strengthen the solidarity of the people from all sectors and strata, and struggle to the end for Sino-Japanese friendship and economic and cultural exchanges between the two countries."

    日本各团体紧急集会抗议佐藤政府拒绝刘宁一团长入境
    坚决为加强日中人民团结友好而斗争到底
    新华社东京三日电  日本各界人民代表二日晚在东京举行紧急集会，抗议日本政府悍然拒绝中国代表团团长刘宁一到日本出席禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会。
    这次紧急抗议集会是由日中友好协会、日中文化交流协会、日中贸易促进会、日本国际贸易促进协会、国会议员促进日中贸易联盟、日本地方议员促进国际贸易联盟、中国遣返人员联络委员会、中国人俘虏殉难者慰灵实行委员会、日中佛教交流恳谈会、日本恢复日中邦交联络会议、日本记者会议、日本国民救援会、日本青年法学家协会、日中输出入协会等十五个团体主办的。出席这次集会的有日本各群众团体和友好商社代表八百四十多人。日中文化交流协会常任理事、亚非作家会议日本协议会主席白石凡以及政治界、经济界、妇女、青年各界人士相继在会上讲了话，他们一致严厉谴责和抗议日本政府无理拒绝刘宁一团长入境。
    会上全场一致通过一项决议指出，“（日本）政府拒绝刘宁一入境，完全是蓄意破坏日中关系的无理行径。”决议指出，“外务省对廖承志办事处驻东京联络事务所首席代表孙平化发表的正当声明，竟然提出‘驱逐出境’等等，这是企图进一步恶化日中关系。”
    决议指出，日本政府的一系列行动，是“同美国逐步扩大侵略越南战争相呼应的敌视中国政策的逐步扩大。”
    决议说，“我们不愿意重演由于‘长崎国旗事件’而引起的‘日中关系中断’的悲剧。”决议说，“现在发生的事态，的确是要战争，还是要和平，要敌视中国，还是要日中友好的斗争；这种事态，使日中友好和两国人民之间的各种往来陷于空前危机。”
    决议最后表示坚决反对参与美帝国主义战争政策的日本军国主义的复活和佐藤政府加紧奉行敌视中国的政策，抗议拒绝刘宁一团长入境。决议说，“我们坚决加强各界各阶层人民的坚强团结，为日中友好和两国间的经济、文化交流斗争到底。”
