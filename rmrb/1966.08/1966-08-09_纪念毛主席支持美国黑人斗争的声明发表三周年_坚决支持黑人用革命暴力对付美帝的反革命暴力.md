Today marks the third anniversary of the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong's statement "Support the Just Struggle of the American Blacks Against U.S. Imperialism's Racial Discrimination." More than ten thousand people from various circles in the capital held a grand meeting this afternoon to express that the 700 million Chinese people will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly and enthusiastically support Chairman Mao's statement, which has profound political significance and great historical importance, and resolutely support the American black brothers in their heroic struggle against U.S. imperialism's racial discrimination.

Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, Yang Mingxuan, Peng Dehuai, Liu Ningyi, Zhou Jianren, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Gao Chongmin, Xu Deheng, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Cai Tingkai, and others attended the meeting.

The meeting passed a telegram supporting the struggle of American blacks (full text to be published separately).

Today's meeting was held at the Great Hall of the People. The venue was filled with the songs "The East Is Red," "The Sailboat Sails on the Sea," and "The Internationale." A large banner hung in the center of the venue: "Firmly support the just struggle of American blacks against U.S. imperialism's racial discrimination! Long live the struggle of American blacks against racial discrimination and for freedom and equal rights! All the people of the world unite, form the broadest and most genuine united front, and overthrow U.S. imperialism!"

Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity and Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Association for Peace and Friendship with Foreign Countries, delivered the opening speech. He said, Chairman Mao's statement pointed out the correct direction for the struggle of American blacks against racial discrimination and for freedom and equal rights, illuminating the path forward for the liberation of American blacks and all oppressed peoples and nations worldwide. Chairman Mao's statement has been warmly endorsed by the Chinese people, actively responded to by American blacks, and widely supported by the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world. Today, we gather to commemorate Chairman Mao's statement, which has profound political significance and great historical importance, to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly support the just struggle of American black brothers, and resolutely support the liberation struggle of all oppressed peoples and nations worldwide, and carry forward the struggle against U.S. imperialism to the end.

The meeting then read a telegram from William Epton, Vice Chairman of the Progressive Labor Party in the United States, sent from New York on August 6 to Robert Williams. The telegram said: "The black people in the United States are waging a struggle for self-determination and liberation. At the same time, we firmly support the heroic Vietnamese people who are waging a fierce armed struggle for self-determination against U.S. imperialism. We salute the Chinese people because they are leading the world revolutionary movement against U.S. imperialism and the revisionism headed by the Soviet Union. At this moment, we stand together with you, believing that the world revolutionary movement will surely defeat U.S. imperialism and its revisionist partners."

Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the Chinese People's Association for Peace and Friendship with Foreign Countries Guo Moruo delivered a lengthy speech at the meeting (full text to be published on the third page).

Robert Williams, an American black leader currently in Beijing, American friend Li Dunbai, and Sudanese peace activist Kair spoke at the meeting (full text of Robert Williams' speech to be published on the third page). They unanimously pointed out that Chairman Mao's great statement has been warmly welcomed and responded to by the working people and all the people who oppose imperialism and love freedom and justice in the United States, and it has powerfully promoted the rapid development of the struggle of American blacks.

American friend Li Dunbai said, the American people will never forget that it was Mao Zedong, far away from us, who saw that the rapidly developing black struggle is "a manifestation of the increasingly sharp class struggle and national struggle within the United States." Three years ago, when revisionists and other charlatans were calling on black freedom fighters to surrender in the face of violent suppression, Chairman Mao announced the great revolutionary truth that: cruelty and violence can only make the angry black masses fight more bravely and gain broader support. This revolutionary truth has been fully verified in the past three years.

Li Dunbai said, Chairman Mao Zedong's profound analysis that national struggle is ultimately a class struggle has elevated the struggle for black freedom to a new stage and opened the way for a new anti-imperialist mass movement in the United States.

He pointed out that the rapid development of the black freedom movement in the past two months has fully confirmed Chairman Mao's profound analysis. Blacks are abandoning the erroneous theory of "non-violence" and replacing it with the slogan of "using revolutionary violence to counter revolutionary violence." American blacks are openly uniting with the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, supporting the glorious struggle of the Vietnamese brothers, and increasingly linking their struggle with the greatest fighter for liberation, Mao Zedong, and increasingly combining it with the truth of Mao Zedong Thought for the struggle for freedom.

Li Dunbai said, whether or not to wholeheartedly support the struggle of blacks is a test for every American revolutionary. Today in the United States, a person who consistently opposes imperialism is a staunch fighter against white racism, and a person who thoroughly opposes racism is a person who opposes the capitalist-imperialist system.

He said, the future of the United States belongs to the class-conscious working people. Class-conscious American workers are fighting from within the fortress of U.S. imperialism to support the encirclement of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against U.S. imperialism. History is verifying the correctness of Chairman Mao's brilliant statement.

Sudanese friend Kair also spoke at the meeting. He said, since Chairman Mao Zedong issued the statement three years ago, the struggle of American blacks has undergone significant changes in both nature and scale. More and more blacks have begun to realize that in the face of the violent suppression of their movement by the monopolistic bourgeoisie of racism, they must rise up to resist. Some have even taken up arms to defend themselves and fight against the violence of the police and fascist groups. They have also begun to realize that the U.S. government's domestic policy of racism is closely linked to its policy of war, aggression, intervention, and suppression in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world.

Kair strongly condemned the fact that while the U.S. imperialists are pushing a policy of racism at home, they have consistently supported other racist regimes and policies in terms of both morality and material. He condemned the U.S. imperialists' brutal interference in Sudan's internal affairs and their evil activities of destroying the anti-imperialist unity of the Sudanese people. He said, we announce to our American black brothers: as victims of U.S. imperialism's interference and aggression, in the struggle against our common enemy—U.S. imperialism and neo-colonialism—we have a more solid connection with you.

Kair said, whether in the struggle against racial discrimination, in the struggle for national independence and liberation, the glorious Communist Party of China and the hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and the broad masses of the Chinese people led by Chairman Mao Zedong, stand most closely with us, fight shoulder to shoulder with us, inspire us, and provide us with genuine, not false, support and assistance. The modern revisionists of the Soviet Union and their followers have never done this and will never do this in the future, because they have long since deviated from the path of struggle against U.S. imperialism and the path of proletarian internationalism. Glory belongs to the great Chinese people. Glory belongs to the Communist Party of China. Glory belongs to Chairman Mao Zedong.

All the speeches at the meeting were met with wave after wave of enthusiastic applause from the audience.

Friends from Asian, African, and Latin American countries, as well as from other countries around the world, attended today's meeting. Among them were: Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association Zha Heduo, Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau Senanayake, Head of the Vietnamese Cultural Delegation Phan Ngoc Chuong, Head of the Permanent Delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China Chen Wencheng, Japanese friends Shazama Ichiro, Nishizono Kazuichi, Chief of the Palestine Liberation Organization Office in Beijing Galbo, Head of the Malayan National Liberation League Delegation in China Shalma, Assistant to the Overseas Representative of the Thai Patriotic Front Mongkhon Nanasong, President of the Lao Women's Union Kue Ning Bunxen, Indonesian peace activist Willy, and friends from Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Belgium, and Basutoland who came to China to visit after withdrawing from the 12th World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs to uphold the glorious tradition of the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs.

Attending the meeting were also leaders from various democratic parties, people's organizations, and Beijing Municipality in China, including Zhang Sirou, Ding Xilin, Wang Kunlun, Ji Fang, Chen Qiyu, Hu Juewen, Hu Zihuang, Zhou Peiyuan, Liu Qingyang, Ma Pungu, Zhang Zhiren, Xu Mengshan, Hu Chi, Wang Zhaohua, and Wu Shaozu (with photos).

    纪念毛主席支持美国黑人斗争的声明发表三周年
    坚决支持黑人用革命暴力对付美帝的反革命暴力
    周总理陈副总理等出席，郭沫若、罗伯特·威廉、李敦白、凯尔在会上讲话
    据新华社八日讯　今天是伟大领袖毛泽东主席发表《支持美国黑人反对美帝国主义种族歧视的正义斗争的声明》三周年。首都各界一万多人下午隆重集会，表示七亿中国人民要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，最坚决地、最热烈地拥护毛主席这一具有深远政治影响和重大历史意义的声明，坚决支持美国黑人兄弟反对美帝国主义种族歧视的英勇斗争。
    国务院总理周恩来，副总理陈毅，人大常委会副委员长郭沫若、杨明轩、程潜、刘宁一、周建人，政协全国委员会副主席高崇民、许德珩，国防委员会副主席蔡廷锴等出席了大会。
    大会通过了支持美国黑人斗争的通电（全文另发）。
    今天的大会在人民大会堂举行。会场上响彻着《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》、《全世界无产者联合起来》的歌声。会场正中高悬巨大横幅标语：“坚决支持美国黑人反对美帝国主义种族歧视的正义斗争！美国黑人反对种族歧视，争取自由和平等权利的斗争胜利万岁！”“全世界人民团结起来，结成最广泛的、最真实的统一战线，打倒美帝国主义！”
    中国亚非团结委员会主席、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席廖承志致开会词，他说，毛主席的声明，给美国黑人反对种族歧视，争取自由和平等权利的斗争，指出了正确的方向，为美国黑人和全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族的解放，照亮了前进的道路。毛主席的声明，得到了中国人民的热烈拥护，得到了美国黑人的积极响应，也得到了亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界人民的广泛支持。今天，我们来纪念毛主席的这一篇具有深远政治影响和重大历史意义的声明，就是要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决支持美国黑人兄弟的正义斗争，坚决支持全世界一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族的解放斗争，把反对美帝国主义的斗争进行到底。
    大会接着宣读了美国进步劳工党副主席威廉·埃普顿八月六日于纽约发来的致罗伯特·威廉的电报。电报说：“美国的黑人正在进行争取自决和解放的斗争。与此同时，我们对正在为反对美帝国主义、争取自决而进行激烈武装斗争的英雄的越南人民表示坚决支持。我们向中国人民致敬，因为他们领导着反对美帝国主义和以苏联为首的修正主义的世界革命运动。在这个时刻，我们与你们携手在一起，相信世界革命运动定将战胜美帝国主义和与之合伙的修正主义。”
    人大常委会副委员长、中国和委会主席郭沫若在会上发表了长篇讲话
  （全文见第三版）。
    正在北京的美国黑人领袖罗伯特·威廉、美国朋友李敦白、苏丹和平人士凯尔先后在大会上讲话（罗伯特·威廉的讲话全文见第三版）。他们一致指出，毛主席的伟大声明受到了美国的劳动人民和所有反对帝国主义、热爱自由和正义的人民的热烈欢迎和响应，它有力地推动了美国黑人斗争的迅速发展。
    美国朋友李敦白说，美国人民永远不会忘记，是远离我们万里之外的毛泽东，看出了迅速发展的黑人斗争是“美国国内阶级斗争和民族斗争日益尖锐化的表现”。三年前，正当修正主义分子和其他骗子们号召黑人自由战士们在暴力镇压面前屈服的时候，毛主席宣布了伟大的革命真理，即：残酷和暴力只能使愤怒的黑人群众更英勇地斗争，只能使他们得到更加广泛的支持。这一革命真理三年来已得到充分的验证。
    李敦白说，毛泽东主席关于民族斗争说到底是一个阶级斗争问题的精辟分析，为黑人争取自由的斗争上升到一个新的阶段，为在美国开始一个新的反帝群众运动开辟了道路。　
    他指出，最近两个月黑人自由运动突飞猛进的发展，完全证实了毛主席的精辟分析。黑人正在放弃“非暴力”的错误理论，而代之“以革命的暴力来对付反革命的暴力”的口号。美国黑人公开与亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的被压迫人民联合起来，支持光荣的越南兄弟的英勇斗争，并且日益把他们的斗争同解放事业最伟大的战士毛泽东联系在一起，日益同争取自由的真理毛泽东思想相结合。
    李敦白说，是否全心全意地支持黑人的斗争，对每一个美国革命者是一个考验。今天在美国，一个一贯反对帝国主义的人，就是一个反对白人种族主义的坚强战士，一个彻底反对种族主义的人，就是一个反对资本主义—帝国主义制度的人。
    他说，美国的未来是属于有阶级觉悟的劳动人民。有觉悟的美国劳动人民正在从美帝国主义堡垒的内部进行斗争，来支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民对美帝国主义的大包围。历史正在证实毛主席的光辉的声明的正确。
    苏丹朋友凯尔也在大会上讲话。他说，自从三年前毛泽东主席发表声明以来，美国黑人的斗争无论在性质上或规模上，都发生了显著的变化。越来越多的黑人已经开始意识到，面临着种族主义的垄断资产阶级对他们的运动所进行的暴力镇压，他们必须起来抵抗。有些人甚至已经拿起武器自卫，抗击警察的暴力和法西斯集团。他们并开始意识到美国政府对内的种族主义政策同它在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界所推行的战争、侵略、干涉和镇压的对外政策是密切联系在一起的。
    凯尔强烈谴责美帝国主义在国内推行种族主义政策的同时，也一贯在道义上和物质上全力支持其他种族主义的政权和政策，谴责美帝国主义粗暴干涉苏丹内政，破坏苏丹人民反帝团结的罪恶活动。他说，我们向美国的黑人兄弟宣布：作为美帝国主义的干涉和侵略的受害者，在反对全世界各国人民的共同敌人——美帝国主义和新殖民主义——的斗争中，我们同你们之间是有着更坚固的联系的。
    凯尔说，无论是在反对种族歧视的斗争中，在争取民族独立和解放的斗争中，光荣的中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导的千百万工、农、兵、革命的知识分子和广大的中国人民，同我们最紧密地站在一起，坚决和我们携手并肩共同战斗，鼓舞我们，并给予我们真正的、而不是虚假的支持和援助。苏联现代修正主义者及其追随者过去从来没有这样做，将来也决不会这样做，因为他们早已离开了反对美帝国主义斗争的道路，离开了无产阶级国际主义的道路。光荣属于伟大的中国人民。光荣属于中国共产党。光荣属于毛泽东主席。
    大会上的所有讲话，都在全场激起了一阵又一阵的热烈掌声。
    在北京的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲国家以及世界其他国家的友人，出席了今天的大会。他们当中有：亚非新闻工作者协会总书记查禾多，亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克，越南文化代表团团长范玉纯，越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团团长陈文成，日本朋友砂间一良、西园寺公一，巴勒斯坦解放组织驻北京办事处主任加尔布，马来亚民族解放同盟驻中国代表团团长沙尔玛，泰国爱国阵线常驻国外代表助理蒙空·纳那空，老挝妇联主席贵宁·奔舍那夫人，印度尼西亚和平人士威利，为维护禁止原子弹氢弹运动光荣传统而退出第十二届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会后前来中国访问的澳大利亚、新西兰、锡兰、苏丹、比利时、巴苏陀兰的朋友。
    出席大会的还有我国各民主党派、各人民团体以及北京市的负责人，他们当中有张奚若、丁西林、王昆仑、季方、陈其尤、胡厥文、胡子昂、周培源、刘清扬、马纯古、张志让、徐萌山、胡痴、王照华、伍绍祖等。（附图片）
