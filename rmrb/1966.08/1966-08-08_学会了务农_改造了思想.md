	Learning Agriculture and Transforming Thoughts
	Through a year of agricultural production labor, our platoon has gained a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's statement that participating in production can improve the political quality of the army.

	Vice Platoon Leader, Certain Unit of the People's Liberation Army, Wú Huáizhèng

	Last year, the regiment assigned our platoon a task of "learning agriculture"—to clear three hundred acres of wasteland in a certain place and plant rice. After the task was assigned, the entire platoon was very happy, saying: "This is Chairman Mao's concern for our political well-being. We must, in the process of labor, both learn technology and temper ourselves, achieving double victories in thought and production."

	The first task in learning agriculture was to learn how to clear the land. This place was a grassy marsh. Due to the cold weather and frozen ground, the grass roots were intertwined, making it very labor-intensive with little progress. Some comrades lost their confidence. We organized everyone to further study Chairman Mao's instructions on the army's three major tasks of fighting, doing mass work, and production, raising everyone's understanding of the army's building thought, and mobilizing everyone's enthusiasm and creativity. The son of a cadre, Bái Shǒudé, joined the army and was assigned to the transport platoon as a driver. Later, he was transferred to our platoon to learn agriculture. At first, he felt a bit confused. After studying, he realized that his thoughts were completely wrong. He said: "Before liberation, my family had no roof over our heads and no land under our feet. My father joined the revolution to overthrow the reactionaries. I grew up under the care of the Party and Chairman Mao. Today, Chairman Mao tells us to learn agriculture. If I don't understand this, how can I be a good soldier of Chairman Mao?" From then on, he changed completely, always practicing diligently and humbly learning from comrades who were good at clearing land. Once, he fell ill, but as soon as he recovered, he insisted on returning to work. The platoon leaders and comrades all advised him to rest, but he refused, saying: "We are learning agriculture, but we are tempering our thoughts. What is this little difficulty?" He not only quickly learned how to farm but also strictly tempered himself. In his first year of enlistment, he was honored to join the Communist Party of China.

	Chairman Mao said: "After the army participates in production, not only does it overcome difficulties, reduce government expenditures, and improve the army's living conditions, but through labor tempering, it also improves the army's political quality, improves the relationship between officers and soldiers, and the relationship between the army and the people."

	Through a year of labor tempering, we have gained a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's thoughts. In one year, we not only learned how to farm but also transformed our thoughts, that is, "improved the army's political quality." The entire platoon had nineteen comrades join the Party and the League this year, and was evaluated as a Four Good Platoon at the end of the year.

    学会了务农　改造了思想
    我们连队通过一年的农业生产劳动，对毛主席所说的参加生产可以提高军队的政治质量，有了更深刻的体会。
    解放军某部副连长　吴怀正
    去年，团里交给我们连一项“学农”的任务——到某地开三百亩荒地，栽种水稻。任务下达以后，全连都很高兴，说：“这是毛主席对我们政治上的关心，我们一定要在劳动的过程中，既学技术，又练人，思想、生产双丰收。”
    学农的第一件事是学开荒。这里是一片草滩，由于天寒地冻，草根盘结，费力很大，成绩很小，有的同志丧失了信心。我们组织大家进一步学习毛主席关于军队要担负打仗、做群众工作、生产三大任务的指示，提高大家对人民军队建军思想的认识，调动大家的积极性和创造性。干部子弟白守德，入伍后被分配到运输连当驾驶员，后又调到我们连来学农。开始，他有些想不通；学习以后，他感到自己这种想法完全错了。他说：“解放前，我家上无片瓦，下无寸土，爸爸为了打倒反动派，参加了革命。自己在党和毛主席的哺育下成长起来。今天，毛主席叫我们学农，自己思想不通，这哪能是毛主席的好战士呢？”从此以后，他完全变了样，总是认真地实践，虚心地向开荒快的同志学习。有一次，他病了，病刚好，又要求出院参加劳动。连里领导和同志们都劝他休息休息，但他不肯，说：“我们学的是农，可炼的是思想，这点困难算得了啥！”他不仅很快地学会了务农，还严格地锻炼了自己，入伍第一年，就光荣地加入了中国共产党。
    毛主席说：“军队在参加生产之后，不仅战胜了困难，减少了政府的开支，改善了军队的生活，并且经过劳动锻炼，还提高了军队的政治质量，改善了官兵关系和军民关系。”
    通过一年的劳动锻炼，我们对毛主席的思想有了更深刻的体会。我们在一年的时间里既学会了务农，又改造了思想。就是说“提高了军队的政治质量”。全连在这一年中有十九个同志入了党入了团，年终被评为四好连队。
