	Grabbing the Revolution, Promoting Production, Achieving a Bumper Harvest
	An increase in early rice production in Anhui and a bumper harvest of summer grain in Ningxia's Yellow River Irrigation Area

	According to Xinhua News Agency from Hefei, Anhui's broad masses of cadres and commune members are joyfully harvesting early rice. This year, Anhui Province's early rice planting area is nearly double that of last year. From the situation of what has already been harvested, the yield per unit area is generally higher than last year.

	This year, Anhui Province's early rice achieved a large-scale increase in production, which is a new victory for the broad masses of cadres and commune members in holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and further studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Since spring, the broad masses of cadres and commune members across the province have, based on summarizing and carrying forward last year's experience, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works with problems in production. They used Mao Zedong Thought to raise their class consciousness and actively engaged in production struggles. During the early rice seedling period, various places generally encountered cold waves and low temperatures, resulting in seedling rot. At this time, various places immediately organized cadres and commune members to study Chairman Mao's works with this problem, using Chairman Mao's teachings as a guide to overcome difficulties and grow good seedlings. The Wuhu Prefecture organized cadres and commune members to study articles such as "Put Down Your Burdens and Start the Machine" and "Abandon Illusions, Prepare for Struggle," overcoming the complacency of production reaching its peak, strengthening seedling management, and, according to Chairman Mao's strategic thinking of not fighting unprepared battles and not fighting battles without assurance, actively making two preparations, leaving enough spare seeds and seedlings, striving not to have seedling rot, and if there is rot, being able to replant in time. Because of these measures, adverse conditions such as continuous rain were effectively overcome, seedlings were grown sufficiently, and timely transplanting was ensured.

	In field management, the broad masses of commune members always remembered Chairman Mao's teaching that "only by grasping something very tightly and without letting go can it be grasped. If it is not grasped tightly, it is as good as not grasping it at all." At every critical point of increasing production, they insisted on being serious and tight, doing everything meticulously, not missing a single field, not letting go of a single move, and managing it to the end.

	According to Xinhua News Agency from Yinchuan, the 1.4 million mu of wheat, barley, peas, and other summer grains in Ningxia's Yellow River Irrigation Area have again achieved a bumper harvest this year. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the irrigation area, who have just finished harvesting summer grains, are smiling and happy, saying: The bumper harvest of summer grains is the result of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

	Since this spring, many people's communes in the Yellow River Irrigation Area have, in the course of carrying out the socialist education movement, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works. The broad masses of cadres and commune members have greatly improved their ideological awareness. In the process of the socialist education movement and after its conclusion, the leadership organized the masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. The broad masses of commune members, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants, deeply felt through several months of practice that among all important things, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is the most important. They used a large amount of evidence to prove that the bumper harvest of summer grains in the irrigation area is the product of acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

	This year, the water level of the Yellow River within the irrigation area is low, and the flow is less than in previous years. Many places could not water the wheat, and drought occurred. The commune members studied Chairman Mao's articles such as "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," strengthened their confidence in overcoming drought, and used methods such as lifting water for irrigation to ensure that the wheat received enough water, guaranteeing its normal growth.

    抓革命　促生产　夺丰收
    安徽早稻大面积增产　宁夏引黄灌区夏粮丰收
    据新华社合肥电　安徽广大干部和社员正喜气洋洋地收割早稻。今年，安徽省的早稻种植面积比去年扩大了将近一倍。从各地已收打的情况来看，单位面积产量一般都高于去年。
    今年安徽省早稻大面积增产，是广大干部和社员高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步活学活用毛主席著作的新胜利。自春季以来，全省各地广大干部和社员一起，在总结和发扬去年经验的基础上，积极地带着生产中存在的问题活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想提高自己的阶级觉悟，积极进行生产斗争。在早稻育秧期间，各地普遍碰到了寒潮、低温，发生了烂秧现象。这时，各地立即组织干部和社员带着这个问题认真学习毛主席著作，把毛主席的教导作为战胜困难、育好秧苗的行动指南。芜湖专区组织干部和社员学习了《放下包袱，开动机器》、《丢掉幻想，准备斗争》等文章，克服了生产到顶的自满思想，加强育秧工作，同时，按照毛主席的不打无准备之仗，不打无把握之仗的战略思想，积极做好两手准备，留足了备用种籽和秧苗，力争不烂秧，烂了也能适时补播。因为采取了这些办法，有效地战胜了连续阴雨等不利条件，育足了秧苗，保证了适时插秧的需要。
    在田间管理上，广大社员始终记住毛主席关于“什么东西只有抓得很紧，毫不放松，才能抓住。抓而不紧，等于不抓。”的教导，在每个增产的关键上，都坚持认真、抓紧，做到一丝不苟，一田不漏，一着不让，一管到底。
    据新华社银川电　宁夏引黄灌区一百四十多万亩小麦、大麦、豌豆等夏粮作物，今年又普遍获得丰收。刚收割完夏粮作物的灌区广大贫下中农社员喜笑颜开地说：夏粮作物的丰收，是人们活学活用毛主席著作的结果。
    今春以来，引黄灌区许多人民公社在开展社会主义教育运动中，广大干部和社员活学活用毛主席著作，思想觉悟大大提高。各地在社会主义教育运动过程中和运动结束之后，领导群众活学活用毛主席著作。广大社员、特别是贫下中农，经过几个月的实践深深地体会到：千重要，万重要，活学活用毛主席著作最重要。他们用大量事实证明，灌区夏粮丰收，就是照毛主席指示办事的产物。
    今年，灌区境内黄河水位低，流量比往年少。许多地区小麦浇不上水，发生干旱。社员们学习了毛主席的《愚公移山》等文章，增强了战胜干旱的信心，用提水灌溉等方法，给小麦浇足了水，保证了小麦的正常生长。
