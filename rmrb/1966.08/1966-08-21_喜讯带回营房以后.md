The soldiers and officers of the 1st Company who participated in the celebration of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the capital returned to their barracks. Without washing their faces or eating, they gathered in groups of threes and fours and rushed to various brother companies in the entire regiment to report on the meeting and spread the spirit of the meeting. Although everyone had already heard the news of Chairman Mao's meeting with revolutionary masses from the radio, the name "Chairman Mao" still attracted everyone's heart like a magnet. Everyone crowded around the propagandists, and the soldiers of the 2nd Company even held a welcome meeting. When the propagandists mentioned that Chairman Mao was wearing military clothes, full of vigor, and in good health, everyone was extremely excited and immediately shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Some people even couldn't help but jump up.

At this moment, the entire barracks were in an uproar. The slogans celebrating the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live the Communist Party of China!", and the songs of "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" merged into a tremendous roar, shaking the blue sky filled with clouds.

    此刻，整个营房沸腾了。庆祝无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大胜利的口号声，“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”的欢呼声，《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》的歌唱声，汇成一股巨响，震荡着彩云片片的蔚蓝天空。……
