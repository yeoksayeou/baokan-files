The great "August 1" Military Anniversary has arrived. The People's Liberation Army is our great leader Chairman Mao Zedong's personally created great army, an army armed with Mao Zedong Thought, an army that helps us poor people rise up. In the old society, we were trampled underfoot by the reactionary ruling class, unable to breathe. It was the great Communist Party and Chairman Mao who led the People's Liberation Army to rescue us from the abyss of suffering and help us live a happy life. I, a mere latrine cleaner, was elected as a delegate to the National People's Congress, and I have taken two photos with our great leader Chairman Mao. On October 26, 1959, I even shook hands with Chairman Liu Shaoqi. This is truly a world turned upside down! Thinking of all this, I feel a surge of strength, and I want to shout: The Communist Party of China is the greatest, Chairman Mao is the greatest, and the People's Liberation Army led by Chairman Mao is the greatest!

Every year, many comrades from the People's Liberation Army come to work with our sanitation team. They not only eat, live, and work with us but, more importantly, they spread Mao Zedong Thought and teach us to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Many moving stories about the People's Liberation Army are told in our sanitation team.

Last spring festival, nine comrades from Shanghai came to us. As soon as they put down their bags, they started carrying manure with us. These comrades were already very tired after carrying manure for half a day, but in the afternoon, they studied Chairman Mao's works with everyone. Several female comrades even secretly washed all the bedding of our dozens of workers clean. The old workers were deeply moved and said, "In the old society, those reactionary policemen would either punch or kick us as soon as they saw our manure cart. Who would come to carry the manure buckets! In the old society, we latrine cleaners would run away as soon as we saw the Nationalist army. Now, the People's Liberation Army 'completely' and 'thoroughly' serves the people, treating us workers better than their own family, truly the good soldiers educated by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!"

The comrades from the People's Liberation Army truly understand the hearts of us latrine cleaners. In 1964, we were studying Chairman Mao's works, but there were too few books—ten or more people in a class shared just one book. How could that work? Everyone decided to go to the New China Bookstore and buy ten or more books! However, because the anti-Party clique led by Zhou Yang did not allow the Ministry of Culture to print more of Chairman Mao's works, we queued for more than ten days but didn't get a single book. Everyone was just anxious.

The comrades from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army somehow heard about our need for Chairman Mao's books and rushed to send us ten copies of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume II. We held Chairman Mao's books in our hands, and we were so happy we couldn't speak. Everyone's heart said: Comrades from the People's Liberation Army, you truly understand our latrine cleaners' boundless love for Chairman Mao!

The People's Liberation Army is our great example. From the comrades' words and deeds, we can learn the experience of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. About a year ago, a comrade from the People's Liberation Army returned to Beijing from Harbin to visit his family. This comrade put down his luggage and immediately came to stay with us in the sanitation team, quickly becoming familiar with us workers. The name "Little Yang" spread quickly! This young man would get up before dawn and go to work with us. Seeing that we workers had some active thoughts, he would study Chairman Mao's works with everyone. Little Yang also bought thirteen books by Chairman Mao, each tailored to the different active thoughts of the classmates, and distributed them to everyone.

Our class has an old worker named Zhong Jun. In the old society, he was also a poor child. His mother and sister begged for food on the streets, and he started working for the capitalists at the age of eight, cleaning latrines and watching toilets, truly suffering from the capitalists' oppression and exploitation. After liberation, he received the Party's and comrades' care without any omission, and his life truly changed! However, he gradually forgot his roots as he lived a better life. To help his class brother, Little Yang visited Aunt Zhong at night. Aunt Zhong saw the comrade from the People's Liberation Army and was more affectionate than to her own children, with endless words to say. Little Yang told Aunt Zhong about Chairman Mao's teachings, and Aunt Zhong told Little Yang about all the hardships her family endured in the old society.

Twenty days later, Little Yang's leave was over, and he returned to his unit. Soon, he sent Zhong Jun a letter. Opening it, there was also a copy of Zhong Jun's family history. Little Yang's letter said: "Comrade Zhong, whenever you encounter any problems in your thoughts, just look at your family history first!" Zhong Jun read the family history and cried, saying, "I must engrave this in my heart, never forgetting the bitterness of my class!"

Now, Zhong Jun is an active member in our class studying Chairman Mao's works.

The comrades from the People's Liberation Army have educated us greatly! The most unforgettable thing is that on April 21 last year, Comrade Sun Leyi, the good quartermaster of the Second Company of a certain unit of the Jinan Military Region, came to our sanitation team. When he arrived, I was out on duty cleaning latrines. As soon as Comrade Sun Leyi arrived at our team, he went to the kitchen. He would inquire about the dining situation of our workers and suggest modifying the stove to save more coal for the country. Comrade Sun Leyi found that the steamer was leaking steam, so he personally took the steamer to the courtyard and helped the canteen repair it.

I returned from work and saw Comrade Sun Leyi, and I was so happy I almost jumped up. That day, we exchanged our experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works, took a photo, and he also visited our workers' dormitory.

A few days later, the leadership notified me to listen to Comrade Sun Leyi's report. After work, I rushed to the Chongwen District Workers' Club. Comrade Sun Leyi's report inspired me greatly, making me think that we latrine cleaners go to thousands of households and have extensive contact with the masses, and we must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings, using the "two rulers" to measure our work, and doing our best to serve the people.

When saying goodbye, I told Comrade Sun Leyi, "From the way you helped us repair the steamer, I can see that the People's Liberation Army sows the seeds of Mao Zedong Thought wherever it goes. I want to learn from you the spirit of 'completely' and 'thoroughly' serving the people, using Mao Zedong Thought to cultivate successors of the proletarian revolution. Now, American imperialism is plotting to expand its aggression. If it dares to invade China, whether it comes from the air or the sea, you should hit it hard with your rifle, and I will hit it hard with my shovel. We must smash American imperialism to pieces!"

The People's Liberation Army is the sowing team, spreading the revolutionary seeds of Mao Zedong Thought wherever it goes, taking root, sprouting, blooming, and bearing fruit. We latrine cleaners must always learn from the People's Liberation Army, especially learning from the People's Liberation Army's experience in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, better transforming our thoughts, and completely and thoroughly serving the people.

    北京市崇文区清洁队掏粪工人　时传祥
    伟大的“八一”建军节来到了。中国人民解放军是咱们伟大的领袖毛主席亲手缔造的伟大军队，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的帮咱们穷人闹翻身的人民军队。在旧社会里，咱们被反动统治阶级踩在脚底下喘不过气来，是伟大的共产党和毛主席领导人民解放军，把咱们从火坑里救出来，过上了幸福的生活。我一个掏粪工人竟当选为全国人民代表大会代表，曾经两次同我们伟大的领袖毛主席一起照相，一九五九年十月二十六日，还同刘少奇主席握手。这真是翻天覆地的变化啊！想起这一切，我就觉得浑身充满了力量，我就要高呼中国共产党最伟大，毛主席最伟大，毛主席领导的中国人民解放军最伟大！
    咱们清洁队年年都有许多解放军同志来劳动，他们个个都是毛主席的好战士。他们到清洁队，不光和我们同吃同住，一起参加劳动，更主要的是传播毛泽东思想，教我们活学活用毛主席著作。在我们清洁队，传颂着解放军的许多动人故事。
    前年春节，从上海来了九位解放军同志。他们一放下背包，就同我们一起去背粪。这些同志背了半天粪已经很累了，可是，他们下午又同大伙儿一起学习毛主席著作。几位女同志还偷偷地把我们几十个工人的被子全给拆洗得干干净净。老工人都十分感动地说：“在旧社会，那些反动警察看到咱们的粪车一停下来，不是拳打就是脚踢，哪儿会来背粪桶！在旧社会里，咱们掏粪工人一见国民党军队，扭头就跑。如今，人民解放军‘完全’、‘彻底’地为人民服务，对咱们工人比亲人还亲，真是共产党和毛主席教育出来的好战士啊！”
    解放军同志最懂得咱们掏粪工人的心。一九六四年，咱们大学毛主席著作，可就是书太少，十多个人的一个班才一本书。这怎么行！大伙儿一合计，都说上新华书店挂个钩，买十几本吧！可是，由于周扬黑帮不让文化部多印毛主席著作，我们排了十多天队，连一本书也没有买到，大家只能干着急。
    解放军某部的同志们不知怎么听到我们需要毛主席的书，就连夜赶着给我们送来十本《毛泽东著作选读》乙种本。我们双手捧着毛主席的书，真是高兴得说不出一句话来。大伙儿心里说：解放军同志啊，你们算是看透了咱们掏粪工人无限热爱毛主席的心思啦！
    解放军是咱们的好榜样。从解放军同志的一言一行，都可以学习到活学活用毛主席著作的经验。一年以前，一位解放军同志从哈尔滨回到北京来探亲。这位同志回家一放下行李，就住到咱们清洁队来，很快就跟咱们工人熟悉了。“小杨”这个名字就很快地传开啦！这个年青人天不亮就同咱们一起出去劳动。看到咱们工人有什么活思想，就同大伙儿一块儿学习毛主席著作。小杨同志还针对班里每个同志不同的活思想，买了十三本毛主席的书，分送给大家。
    咱们班有个老工人，名叫钟俊。在旧社会，他也是个苦孩子，妈妈和妹妹沿街讨饭，自己八岁就给资本家掏粪、看厕所，真是受尽了资本家的压迫和剥削。解放以后，他受到党和同志们无微不至的关怀，生活真是大变样啦！可是，他过上了好日子，却慢慢有点忘本了。为了帮助自己的阶级兄弟，小杨同志深夜去访问钟大娘。大娘一见解放军同志真是比亲孩子还亲，千言万语说不完。小杨就给大娘讲毛主席的教导，大娘就把自己一家在旧社会里受的苦全都告诉了小杨。
    二十天探亲假满期，小杨回到了部队。不久，给钟俊寄来一封信，打开一看，原来里边还有一份钟俊的家史。小杨的信中说：“钟师傅，以后您思想上要遇到什么问题，就先看看家史吧！”钟俊一边读着家史，一边哭着说：“我要在心里打上钢印，永远不忘阶级苦！”现在，钟俊是咱们班学习毛主席著作的积极分子。
    解放军同志对我们的教育真是太大啦！最使我难忘的一桩事儿，就是去年四月二十一日，济南部队某部二连好司务长孙乐义同志来到咱们的清洁队。他来的时候，我正出班掏粪去了。孙乐义同志一到咱们队，就先到厨房，一会儿打听咱们工人的伙食情况，一会儿建议咱们修改炉灶，更多地为国家节省烧煤。孙乐义同志发现笼屉有点跑汽，就亲自动手把笼屉端到院里，帮食堂修理起来了。
    我下班回来，一看到孙乐义同志，高兴得几乎跳起来。那天，俺俩互相交流了学习毛主席著作的心得，照了个相，他还参观了咱们的工人宿舍。
    几天以后，领导上通知我去听孙乐义同志的报告。下班后，我就赶到崇文区工人俱乐部。孙乐义同志的报告对我启发很大，使我想到咱们掏粪工人走千家万户，联系群众很广，也一定要时时刻刻牢记毛主席的教导，用“两把尺子”来衡量自己的工作，做到“完全”“彻底”为人民服务。
    临别的时候，我对孙乐义同志说：“从你帮咱们修笼屉这件事可以看到，解放军走到哪里，就把毛泽东思想的种子撒到哪里。我要向你学习‘完全’、‘彻底’为人民服务的精神，用毛泽东思想培养无产阶级革命接班人。现在，美帝国主义正在阴谋扩大侵略战争。只要它胆敢侵犯中国，不管是从空中来，还是从海上来，你就用枪杆子狠狠地打，我就用粪勺子狠狠地砸，咱们一定要把美帝国主义砸个稀巴烂！”
    解放军是播种队，走到哪里，就在哪里撒播毛泽东思想的革命种子，就在哪里扎根发芽、开花结果。我们掏粪工人一定要永远向解放军学习，特别要学习解放军活学活用毛主席著作的经验，更好地改造我们的思想，完全、彻底地为人民服务。
