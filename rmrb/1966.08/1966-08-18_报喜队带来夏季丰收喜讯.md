	The joyous squad brings news of summer harvest.
	Waves of singing, cheers, rolling drums, and laughter fill the air. Despite the heavy rain, the excited crowd continues to move forward. Members of the rural people's commune, bearing the joyous news of the summer harvest, have come to report to Chairman Mao.

	The peasants of the Sanlu Residential Brigade of the Lugouqiao People's Commune heard the broadcast at five in the morning. Without even eating breakfast, they rushed to the city by nine o'clock to quickly inform the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao of the peasants' sentiments. They have many words to tell Chairman Mao. This year, following Chairman Mao's instructions to prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people, they have striven to be self-reliant and changed their old habit of growing only vegetables and not grain. They have implemented a system of growing both grain and vegetables on all their land. After harvesting the vegetables, they also harvested grain, laying the foundation for grain self-sufficiency next year. Experience has shown that as long as one follows Chairman Mao's words, one will achieve victory.

	On the way, the joyous squad encountered heavy rain. Their bodies were soaked through. People took off their raincoats to cover Chairman Mao's portrait and wrap the joyous report card. The drummers even took off their shirts, beating the drums louder. When one person got tired, another took over. The drums and gongs sounded even more loudly. They walked to the reception station in the pouring rain, presenting the large joyous report card, and shouted repeatedly, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Communist Party of China!" The surrounding people were moved by their actions and cheered in response.

　　报喜队带来夏季丰收喜讯
    一片片歌声，一阵阵欢呼，滚成一团的锣鼓声，朗朗的笑声，铺天盖地。激奋的人群，在倾盆大雨中继续向前流动。农村人民公社社员，带着夏季丰收的喜讯，向毛主席报喜来了。
    芦沟桥人民公社三路居大队的贫下中农们，五点钟听到了广播公报的消息，连饭都来不及吃，九点钟就赶到城里，要尽快地让党中央和毛主席知道贫下中农的心意。他们有很多心里话要告诉毛主席。今年，他们听了毛主席备战、备荒、为人民的指示，奋发图强，自力更生，改变了单种蔬菜、不种粮食的旧习惯。全部土地实行了粮菜兼作，收了菜，又收了粮食，给明年争取粮食自给打下了基础。生活经验证明，只要听毛主席的话就会胜利。
    路上，报喜的队伍遇上大雨。他们浑身被雨浇透了。人们取下身上的雨衣，盖住毛主席的像，包住喜报牌。打鼓的人干脆脱下小褂，把鼓擂得更响，这个人累了，另一个上去。锣鼓敲得更响亮了。他们在暴雨中走到接待站，献上了大喜报牌，一个劲地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”周围的人被他们这种行为感动，不住地向他们欢呼致意。
