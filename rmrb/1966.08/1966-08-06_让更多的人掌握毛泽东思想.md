Let More People Master Mao Zedong Thought

I have learned from studying Chairman Mao's works that revolution is the work of thousands and millions of people. Only by letting more people master Mao Zedong Thought can we better promote the development of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.

I, Liu Xiuying, an active participant in studying Chairman Mao's works in the industrial and communications system of Hunan Province, a telephone operator at the Changsha Post and Telecommunications Bureau, firmly support Chairman Mao's call for workers to focus on their work while also studying military, political, and cultural matters. We must also carry out socialist education and criticize the bourgeoisie. Here, I would like to share my experiences in studying and propagating Mao Zedong Thought.

My family has been poor for four generations. My childhood was very difficult; I once begged for food and worked as a maid for a capitalist. The Party and Chairman Mao saved me from this miserable life. In my family's history, I was the first to go to school and become a people's telephone operator.

After starting work, I dedicated myself to my job. When the cook was sick, I helped with the cooking; when the tea water ran out, I boiled more; when others didn't finish their work, I helped them. Some people, however, mocked me, saying I was a beggar and couldn't do the job of a telephone operator. At that time, I couldn't tell right from wrong and felt ashamed of my beggar origins. Indeed, without Mao Zedong Thought in one's mind, one is like a person without a soul, unable to resist the attacks of bourgeois ideology.

At the end of 1963, the bureau party committee called on all employees to learn from Lei Feng and study Chairman Mao's works diligently. Some workers said, "One day without food makes the stomach hungry, one day without studying Chairman Mao's works makes the mind hungry." I understood the feeling of a hungry stomach, but I didn't understand why the mind could also be hungry. Through study, I realized that Lei Feng became a communist warrior after studying Chairman Mao's works. To become a revolutionary warrior myself, I must start by studying Chairman Mao's works. Indeed, after reading "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," I was deeply moved by Chairman Mao's words. I read it over and over, tears in my eyes, thinking deeply. My family was exactly what Chairman Mao described as the rural proletariat, later becoming a wandering proletariat, the most unstable in human life. I read this article every day for over three months. When I began to use the perspective of class struggle to analyze problems, my mind became clear. From then on, I studied Chairman Mao's works every day, no matter how tired I was, I insisted on studying. If I didn't study for a day, I felt uncomfortable. I experienced the hunger of the mind.

From Chairman Mao's teachings, I understand that revolution is the work of thousands and millions of people. Therefore, only by letting more people master Mao Zedong Thought can we better promote the development of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. We have a lot of work to do, but what is the most important? I think the most important thing is to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and let Mao Zedong Thought guide all work and occupy all positions. With this idea in mind, I felt my responsibility had increased. I first thought of my fellow telephone operators, who are all young people with high spirits but need to raise their political awareness and master Mao Zedong Thought. I discussed with them and formed a self-study group to read Chairman Mao's books whenever we had time.

For social issues, I also used Mao Zedong Thought to observe and handle them. Once, I saw many people laughing and arguing in a small teahouse, and there was even someone singing old operas. I felt uncomfortable. I went to the teahouse with the self-study group and read Chairman Mao's quotations to the people or used artistic performances to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, which was welcomed by everyone.

In the process of propagating Mao Zedong Thought, I encountered various obstacles from the bourgeois "gentlemen." They said I was "meddling in other people's business" and tried to increase my workload to make me "mind my own business." I said: For the cause of the proletariat, I cannot stop propagating Mao Zedong Thought! In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I closely combined my work with the struggle, actively applying Chairman Mao's works. I also took up the pen, writing many articles denouncing and criticizing the anti-Party, anti-socialist black gangs. I had never performed on stage in front of thousands of people before, but this year, at the "July 1" workers, peasants, and soldiers' art evening, I went on stage to recite my own poem, "Mao Zedong Thought is the Red Sun in Our Hearts." I am determined: to help more people learn politics, master Mao Zedong Thought, propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and firmly defend Mao Zedong Thought!

### 让更多的人掌握毛泽东思想

    让更多的人掌握毛泽东思想
    我从学习毛主席著作中懂得：革命是千百万人的事情。只有让更多的人掌握毛泽东思想，才能更好地促进中国革命和世界革命事业的发展。
    湖南省工交系统学习毛主席著作积极分子长沙市邮电局话务员  刘秀英
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席，号召工人以工为主，也要兼学军事、政治、文化。也要搞社会主义教育运动，也要批判资产阶级。我从心眼里拥护毛主席的号召。学政治，就是学毛泽东思想。这里谈谈我自己学习毛泽东思想和宣传毛泽东思想的体会。
    我家四代都是贫农。我的童年生活很苦，曾经讨过饭，给资本家当过丫头。党和毛主席把我从苦海中救了出来。在我一家几代人中，我第一个上了学校，并且当上了人民话务员。
    参加工作以后，我就埋头工作。炊事员病了，我帮着做饭；茶水没有了，我帮着烧水；别人没干完的活，我帮着干。有些人却冷言冷语地讽刺我，说我是叫花子出身啦！说我干不了话务员啦！我那时分不清是非，就觉得自己“叫花子”出身不光彩。真是头脑里没有毛泽东思想，就等于没有灵魂，就顶不住资产阶级思想的进攻。
    一九六三年底，邮电局党委号召全体职工以雷锋为榜样，努力学习毛主席著作。有的工人说：“一天不吃饭肚子饿，一天不学毛主席著作思想饿。”我对肚子饿，是深有体会的；为什么思想也会饿呢？当时我不明白。通过学习，我想通了，雷锋就是学习毛主席著作以后迅速成长为共产主义战士的。我要使自己成为一个革命战士，也必须从学习毛主席著作入手。真的，我一读了《中国社会各阶级的分析》这篇文章，就被毛主席的话紧紧地吸引住了。我含着眼泪看了一遍又一遍，边看边想。我的家正是毛主席所说的农村无产阶级，后来因为丧失劳动力，成了游民无产者，成了“人类生活中最不安定者”。我天天读这篇文章，读了三个多月。当我开始学会用阶级斗争的观点来分析问题的时候，心里立刻亮堂了。从此我就每天学习毛主席著作，不管一天怎样疲劳，也要坚持学，一天不学，心情就不舒畅。思想饿的滋味，我尝到了。
    我从毛主席的教导中懂得：革命是千百万人的事情。因此，只有让更多的人掌握毛泽东思想，才能更好地促进中国革命和世界革命事业。我们要做的事情很多，什么是最最重要的呢？我想最最重要的是要宣传毛泽东思想，让毛泽东思想统帅一切工作和占领一切阵地。有了这个想法以后，我觉得自己肩上责任加重了。我首先想到了我身边的话务员同志都是青年人，热情很高，但还需要提高政治觉悟，掌握毛泽东思想。我就和她们商量，成立自学小组，抓紧一切时间读毛主席的书。
    对社会上的事情，我同样用毛泽东思想来观察和处理。一次，我在路上看到一家小茶馆里许多人在嘻笑吵闹，还有唱旧戏的，听了很不是味。我便同自学小组的青年一起到茶馆里去给大家读毛主席语录，或用文艺形式向他们宣传毛泽东思想，受到大家的欢迎。
    就在宣传毛泽东思想的过程中，我碰到了资产阶级“老爷们”的各种刁难，他们说我“多管闲事”，想用增加我的业务的办法来要我“少管闲事”。我说：为了无产阶级事业，不让我宣传毛泽东思想，万万办不到！在这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，我密切结合斗争，活学活用毛主席著作。我还拿起笔杆，写了许多篇声讨、批判反党反社会主义黑帮的文章。我过去没有在几千人大会上表演过节目，可是今年庆祝“七一”工农兵文艺晚会上，我登台朗诵了自己写的《毛泽东思想是我们心中的红太阳》的诗歌。我下定决心：要帮助更多的人学政治，掌握毛泽东思想，努力宣传毛泽东思想，坚决捍卫毛泽东思想！
