The first modern highway bridge across the Yarlung Zangbo River in Tibet—the Ququ Bridge—was officially opened to traffic on August 1st with a grand ceremony.

Leaders including Wang Qimei, Secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region Party Committee, and Alpo Alwang Jinmei, Chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region, along with over 6,000 Tibetan and Han workers, liberated farmers and herdsmen, military personnel, and government officials, attended the opening ceremony.

Construction of the Ququ Bridge began on February 20th of this year. The entire construction process took only 130 days, meeting the requirements of high quality, low cost, and fast speed. It has set a model for the development of industry and transportation in Tibet, demonstrating how to build socialism efficiently.

On both sides of the bridge, Tibetan people dressed in their finest traditional attire held up the Five-Star Red Flag, portraits of Chairman Mao, and freshly harvested barley, shouting slogans such as "Long Live Chairman Mao," "Long Live the Communist Party of China," and "The opening of the Yarlung Zangbo River Bridge is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought."

A 730-meter-long reinforced concrete bridge now stands proudly across the Yarlung Zangbo River in Tibet. This highway bridge was completed in just over 130 days, with low costs and high quality. It is a product of the revolutionary spirit of the general line for socialist construction in China and a triumph of Mao Zedong Thought.

"Throwing Away the Crutch and Forging Our Own Path"

In November 1965, the first design plan for the Ququ Bridge was completed. This plan, created by some bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" in their offices, featured a high steel frame, large-span steel structure, and high-pile foundations—everything seemed very modern. According to this plan, the bridge would take two years to complete and require an investment of over 15 million yuan.

A debate ensued around this design. Tibetan and Han workers, along with most of the designers, said: Such a bridge is not what the Tibetan people need; it does not align with the spirit of the general line. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, discard the "foreign crutch," and blaze our own trail.

In the dead of winter, with the ground frozen and the biting cold, a team of veteran workers and young designers arrived at the banks of the Yarlung Zangbo River. They did not bring any foreign books but carried "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," along with Chairman Mao's teachings: "Dare to struggle, dare to win." They surveyed the riverbed soil, consulted with old ferrymen, held meetings with Tibetan elders, and collected extensive data. They drew up a design plan that started from Tibet's actual construction needs and aligned with the spirit of the general line for building socialism efficiently. Compared to the original design, the bridge length was shortened by about 50 meters, the bridge height was lowered by 90 centimeters, the investment was reduced to 500 million yuan, and the construction period was shortened from two years to over 200 days. The two design plans reflected the struggle between two different ideological paths. The workers said: The production of this design plan is the first victory of Mao Zedong Thought in the construction of the Yarlung Zangbo River Bridge.

"Building the Bridge with 'Two Articles' and Paving the Way with 'Three Articles'"

The roar of engines at the banks of the Yarlung Zangbo River signaled the start of bridge construction. Amidst the engine noise, some dissenting voices emerged: "An investment of 500 million yuan is not enough to buy a bowl of porridge," "Using new techniques, who will believe it?" "Can these workers, who have no technical skills or experience, build a bridge? We might as well stay here for two or three years."

This was another struggle. Indeed, this bridge construction team had never built a modern large-scale bridge on their own. They were known for their skills in "earthwork, stonework, and carrying baskets," and many Tibetan workers were just former serfs who had recently put down their hoes. However, the broad masses of workers had Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon and "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" as their guides. They were fearless and full of fighting spirit.

At that time, one of the new techniques used in the bridge construction was a rammer borrowed from Henan and Shaanxi provinces, an important machine for the foundation work. However, the shaking rammer failed to bring up even a few ounces of sand and stones after shaking and ramming dozens of times. Some bourgeois "authorities" jeered, saying, "This is not a rammer, it's an old cow rammer, a yak rammer."

Should they be deterred by the difficulties and stop the experiment, or should they act according to Chairman Mao's teachings of "practice, cognition, and further practice"? The workers said: Chairman Mao has taught us that we should not learn first and then do; rather, we should do and then learn. Doing is learning. Chairman Mao's words once again gave them strength. The workers responsible for the experiment, the first engineering team's Li Zhongxing class, studied Chairman Mao's articles "Quelling the Mount Tai" and "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?" while experimenting. They deeply understood that failure contains the seeds of success, and the key is whether one has revolutionary perseverance. When the hole collapsed, they filled it and continued. When the rammer fell into the well, they fished it out and reinstalled it. They constantly encouraged each other, saying, "We cannot give up. Even if we can't bring up sand, we must bring up our spirit, experience, and rules." Veteran worker Mao Yuehua, to summarize the experience, did not eat or sleep for four days and four nights, observing and analyzing over 600 rammer operations. Finally, he and other workers discovered that the soil here was very different from that in Henan. The repair shop immediately began modifications.

Thirty-six days passed, 640 hours were spent, and after dozens of modifications, a Tibetan-style rammer was born. Using this technique, three shifts of workers completed a hole in 35 hours.

After completing the task, the workers emphasized: Our bridge was built with the "Two Articles" and paved the way with the "Three Articles."

"Everything Depends on Mao Zedong Thought"

The workers deeply remember Chairman Mao's teachings on "political work being the lifeline of all economic work." They always prioritized political work, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and aimed to cultivate laborers with a high level of socialist consciousness. They said: Whether we can build the bridge well depends on whether our workers' thoughts are revolutionary.

During the reporter's visit to the bridge construction site, the most profound impression was: They could not be separated from Mao Zedong Thought for a moment. They constantly sought guidance from Chairman Mao's works in everything they did. The construction site became a large school for studying Chairman Mao's works. The workers voluntarily followed this rule: "One recording before the meeting" (study a passage before the meeting) and "one recording at the construction site" (study a passage before work). This rule was unbreakable.

Tibetan and Han workers, to be guided by Mao Zedong Thought in everything, wrote Chairman Mao's quotations everywhere, indoors and outdoors, in the dining hall and at the construction site. They carried Chairman Mao's books with them and recorded his words in their diaries. Over a thousand Tibetan and Han workers formed more than 80 study groups for Chairman Mao's works. They said, Chairman Mao's books are the source of strength. Studying Chairman Mao's works gives us energy. Some workers said, "Chairman Mao's words are all truths. We workers must listen to every word and follow it." They regarded Chairman Mao's works as the "golden key," "steering wheel," the red sun in workers' hearts, and the fundamental guarantee for the transformation of people's thoughts.

The first engineering team's rammer class initially did not prioritize political work but was driven by money. After studying Chairman Mao's works and conducting class education, many workers deeply reflected on their past mistakes of forgetting class struggles and going astray. From then on, their spiritual outlook changed greatly. In early January, they took on the task of operating the rammer, overcame difficulties, quickly mastered the machine, and completed 16 rammer holes. This class was continuously rated as an advanced class for four months and won the advanced red flag.

"Looking at the heroes of today, in the rain of Mao Zedong Thought, heroes are emerging in droves." Once Mao Zedong Thought is infused into the workers and peasants, it can be transformed into immense material force. This is an unbreakable truth.

    毛泽东思想的光辉照亮雅鲁藏布江
    横贯西藏雅鲁藏布江上第一座现代化大桥通车
    据新华社拉萨四日电　横贯西藏雅鲁藏布江的第一座现代化大型公路桥梁——曲水雅鲁藏布江大桥，八月一日隆重举行通车典礼。
    中共西藏自治区委员会书记处书记王其梅，西藏自治区主席阿沛·阿旺晋美等负责人，六千多名藏、汉族工人、翻身农牧民、驻军指战员和机关干部，参加了大桥通车典礼。
    曲水雅鲁藏布江大桥是今年二月二十日动工修建的。全部修建时间只用了一百三十多天，达到了高质量、低造价、快速度的要求，为西藏地区在工业交通事业的发展中树立了多快好省地进行社会主义建设的活样板。
    大桥两侧，穿着盛装的藏族劳动人民高举五星红旗、毛主席画象和刚收获的青稞穗，纵情高呼：“毛主席万岁”、“中国共产党万岁”、“雅鲁藏布江大桥通车是伟大的毛泽东思想新胜利”。
    一座长达七百三十多米的钢筋混凝土大桥，在西藏雅鲁藏布江上巍然屹立起来。这座公路大桥全部修建时间只一百三十多天，造价低，质量高。它是我国社会主义建设总路线革命精神的产物，是毛泽东思想的凯歌。
    甩掉“洋拐棍”，走自己的路
    一九六五年十一月，曲水雅鲁藏布江大桥第一号设计方案制订出来了。这是一些资产阶级“专家”、“权威”在办公室里设计的。高大的钢架，大跨径的钢结构，高桩承台……一切都显得那么洋气。按照这个方案，需要两年完工，投资需要一千五百多万元。
    围绕这张图样展开了一场争论。藏、汉族工人和大多数设计人员说：这样的大桥不是我们西藏人民所需要的，它不符合总路线的精神。我们要按照毛主席的教导，甩掉“洋拐棍”，闯出自己的路来。
    冬天，大地冰冻，严寒刺骨，旋转的风沙经常刮得对面不见人影。一支由老工人和青年设计人员组成的队伍来到了雅鲁藏布江畔。他们没有带什么洋书，带来的是《实践论》和《矛盾论》，带的是毛主席教导的话：要敢于斗争，敢于胜利。他们勘察河滩土质，访问老渡工，跟藏族老人开座谈会，广泛收集资料，绘成一幅从西藏建设实际出发、符合总路线多快好省精神的大桥图。与原设计比较，桥长缩短了五十来米，桥身降低了九十厘米，投资下降到五百万元，工期预计从两年缩短到二百多天，两个设计图样反映了设计思想上两条道路的斗争。工人们说：这个设计图样的产生，是毛泽东思想在雅鲁藏布江大桥建设过程中取得的第一个胜利。
    靠“两论”建桥，用“老三篇”开道
    雅鲁藏布江畔一阵阵马达声揭开了大桥修建的序幕，在这一阵阵马达声中，传来了一些噪音：“投资五百万，不够喝稀饭”，“采用新工艺，谁也不相信”，“靠这些没有技术、没有经验的职工，能把大桥修好？干脆在这儿住上两三年吧”。
    这是又一场斗争。的确，这支桥梁工程队伍单独修现代化大型桥梁还是第一次，他们被称为只会“土方、石方、扁担筐筐”，不少藏族工人还是刚放下锄头的翻身农奴。可是，广大职工有毛主席的思想作武器，有《实践论》和《矛盾论》作武器，他们斗志昂扬，无所畏惧。
    当时大桥采用的新工艺中，有一种是从河南、陕西学来的冲抓锥，这是大桥基础工程用来抓孔的重要机械。可是，没想到摇晃的冲抓锥连续冲抓了七八十次，连几两重的沙石都抓不上来。这时，又有一些资产阶级“权威”在一旁泼冷水说：“这不是冲抓锥，是老牛锥，是牦牛锥”。
    是被困难吓倒，停止试验，还是按毛主席的“实践、认识、再实践、再认识”的教导办事。工人们说：毛主席早就教导我们，不是先学好了再干，而是干起来再学习，干就是学习。毛主席的话又一次给大家增添了力量。负责试验的第一工程队李中兴班的六个工人边试验，边学习毛主席《愚公移山》、《人的正确思想是从那里来的？》等文章。他们深深体会到失败中包含着成功的因素，关键在于有没有革命的毅力。孔塌了，他们填起来再干，冲抓锥掉井了，他们捞起来再装上。他们不断地互相鼓励说：“不能放下，抓不出砂子，我们也要抓出志气来，抓出经验来，抓出规律来”。老工人毛月华为了总结经验，饭吃不下，觉睡不着，连续在现场观察四天四夜，分析了六百多次冲抓情况，最后他和其他工人发现，原来这里的土质和河南有很大不同。机修厂的工人立即进行改制。
    三十六天过去了，花了六百四十多个小时，经过几十次的改制，一台西藏式的冲抓锥诞生了。采用这种技术，冲抓三班用三十五个小时便抓完一个孔。
    工人们在胜利完成任务后强调说：我们的大桥是靠“两论”建起的，是靠“老三篇”开的道。
      一切全靠毛泽东思想
    工人们深深记得毛主席关于“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，时时把突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，造就有高度社会主义觉悟的劳动者作为自己的首要任务。他们说：能不能修好大桥，关键在于我们职工思想是否革命化。
    记者在大桥工地访问的日子里，一个最深刻的印象是：他们一时一刻离不开毛泽东思想，时时、事事、处处向毛主席著作请教，工地成了一所学习毛主席著作的大学校。工人们自觉地遵守了这样一个制度：“会前一录”（开会前学习一段语录），“工地一录”（上工前学习一段语录）。这个制度雷打不散。
    藏汉族职工为了用毛泽东思想统帅一切，他们不论在室内室外，食堂工地，到处都写上毛主席语录，到处都作为学习场所。他们把毛主席的书带在身边，把毛主席的话摘录在日记本上。一千多名藏汉族职工，组成了八十多个学习毛主席著作小组。他们说，毛主席的书是力量的源泉，学习了毛主席著作浑身是劲。有的工人说：“毛主席的话句句是真理，我们工人句句要听，字字照办。”他们把毛主席著作当成“金钥匙”、“方向盘”，当作工人心中的红太阳，当作实现人的思想革命化的根本保证。
    第一工程队冲抓班，开始时有的人不是突出政治，而是金钱挂帅。经过学习毛主席著作，并结合进行阶级教育，许多工人沉痛地检查自己忘了阶级苦，走了邪路，从此，他们精神面貌大大改变。今年一月初，他们接受了掌握冲抓机的任务，不断克服困难，很快掌握了这台机器，并且完成了十六个抓孔任务。这个班组连续四个月被评为先进班组，荣获先进红旗。
      “数风流人物还看今朝”，在毛泽东思想的雨露下，英雄人物正层出不穷。毛泽东思想一旦灌输到工农中去，就能转化为巨大的物质力量，这是一条颠扑不破的真理。　新华社记者（本报有删节）（附图片）
