The comrades attending the grassroots political work conference of the grain system in Chaoyang Region, Liaoning, gathered with intense concentration and revolutionary enthusiasm at 8:30 PM on the 23rd to listen to the broadcast by the Central People's Broadcasting Station of two editorials from the *People's Daily*, an editorial from *Red Flag* magazine, and four big-character posters from the Red Guards of Beijing Qinghua University Middle School. The more they listened, the more they enjoyed it, the more they listened, the happier they felt, and the more they listened, the more exhilarated they became.

After the broadcast ended, everyone immediately held a discussion.

The Chaoyang County group said during the discussion: "For thousands of years, the old customs of the exploiting classes have been poisoning the hearts and minds of the broad masses of the people. Now, the revolutionary youngsters of the Red Guards can speak out and act. They fear neither heaven nor earth, dare to climb mountains of knives and seas of fire, and dare to establish an iron-clad dictatorship of the proletariat. We firmly support you, revolutionary youngsters! Hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and revolutionary people support you and vow to be your strong rear guard."

Wang Baozhong, the political director of the Jianchang County Grain Bureau, said: "Today's broadcast was excellent, and I felt very exhilarated listening to it. The revolutionary youngsters of Beijing Red Guards are right. If you don't strike the bell, it won't ring; if you don't move the table, it won't walk. If you don't rebel against the 'authorities' and 'lords' of the bourgeoisie, the socialist system cannot be consolidated. I firmly support them and vow to be their rear guard, carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end."

Zhang Dianqing, the political instructor of the Lao'ge Temple Grain Depot, a model unit in the province's commerce and trade sector and a model branch in the province, said excitedly: "I firmly support the revolutionary actions of the Beijing Red Guards. I fully support changing the place names that are named after feudal emperors and generals. Some brother units come to our grain depot for visits and exchanges of experience, and they all say they are going to Lao'ge Temple. I suggest changing Lao'ge Temple to a revolutionary name." His speech immediately received the warmest support from the attendees.

Liu Dianjie, from the political department of the Jianping County Grain Bureau, said: "The revolutionary actions of the Red Guards are truly heartening. I firmly support them. We need to abolish some of the old regulations and institutions in the grain system that are not beneficial to socialist construction. We should learn from Mao Zedong Thought and not have comprehensive rewards." His words immediately resonated with everyone, and everyone expressed strong support.

The comrades attending the conference all expressed their desire to learn from the Red Guards, take the Red Guards as their example, and actively participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They stated that they would open this conference well with practical actions, turning the conference into one that learns from, propagandizes, executes, and defends Mao Zedong Thought, making Mao Zedong Thought deeply rooted in their minds, and turning the grain enterprises into schools of Mao Zedong Thought.

    学习红卫兵的革命精神  把企业办成毛泽东思想大学校
    正在辽宁朝阳开会的朝阳地区粮食系统基层政治工作会议的全体同志，二十三日晚上八点三十分，聚精会神、满怀革命激情地收听了中央人民广播电台广播的《人民日报》两篇社论，《红旗》杂志社论和北京清华大学附中红卫兵的四张大字报。大家越听越爱听，越听心里越高兴，越听心里越痛快。
    广播结束后，大家立即进行了座谈讨论。
    朝阳县小组在讨论时说：“几千年来剥削阶级的陈规陋习，一直毒化着广大劳动人民的心灵。现在红卫兵革命小闯将，他们说得出，作得到，他们天不怕，地不怕，刀山敢上，火海敢下，敢于闯出一个无产阶级专政的铁打江山来。革命小将们，我们最坚决支持你们，亿万工农兵群众和革命人民在支持你们，誓作你们的坚强后盾。”
    建昌县粮食局政治处主任王宝忠说：“今天的广播太好了，我听了非常痛快。北京红卫兵革命小将们作得对。钟不敲不响，桌子不搬不走。不造资产阶级‘权威’‘老爷’们的反，社会主义制度就不能巩固。我最坚决地支持他们，誓作他们的后盾，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。”
    省财贸五好单位、省五好支部、老爷庙粮库政治指导员张殿清同志激动地说：“我坚决支持北京红卫兵的革命行动，我完全拥护改掉以封建帝王将相命名的地方名称。有些兄弟单位来我们粮库参观、交流经验时，都说是到老爷庙去，我建议把老爷庙改为革命的地名。”他的发言立即受到与会同志最热烈的支持。
    建平县粮食局政治处刘殿杰同志说：“红卫兵的革命行动，真是大快人心，我坚决支持。我们粮食系统的一些旧的规章，对社会主义建设不利的制度要废掉。我们要学习毛泽东思想，不要综合奖。”他的话音刚落，立即引起共鸣，大家表示热烈支持。
    参加会议的同志都表示要向红卫兵学习，以红卫兵为榜样，积极参加无产阶级文化大革命。他们表示要以实际行动开好这次会议，把会议变成学习、宣传、执行、捍卫毛泽东思想的会议，使毛泽东思想在脑子里扎得深深的，把粮食企业办成毛泽东思想大学校。
