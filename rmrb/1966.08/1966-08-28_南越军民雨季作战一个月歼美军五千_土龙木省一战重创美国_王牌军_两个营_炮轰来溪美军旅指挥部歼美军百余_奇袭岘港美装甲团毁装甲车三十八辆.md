South Vietnamese military and civilians achieved brilliant victories in the rainy season, marking the continuous growth of the anti-war forces in South Vietnam.

It has been previously reported that in July alone, the South Vietnamese liberation armed forces annihilated more than ten thousand enemy soldiers, including over five thousand U.S. invaders.

The commentary pointed out that after suffering a strategic defeat in the dry season, the U.S. invaders have further fallen into a passive situation in the rainy season. On various battlefields, the U.S. invaders have suffered continuous heavy blows and suffered heavy defeats.

The commentary said that the characteristics of the U.S. invaders in the rainy season are: more passive strategically, more confused tactically, and lower morale.

The commentary pointed out that the three types of forces of the South Vietnamese liberation armed forces are closely coordinated, fighting more experienced, and the people's war is highly developed. Guerrilla forces and local forces not only frequently cut off the enemy's supply lines, isolate and surround the enemy's bases, but also smashed the military activities of multiple enemy battalions, and repeatedly annihilated entire enemy units.

The commentary said that although the U.S. invaders suffered heavy defeats in the rainy season, they will not learn from their failures. They are plotting new gambles.

The commentary emphasized that the Vietnamese people are prepared and will definitely smash all new war plans of the U.S. invaders against South and North Vietnam, ready at any time to give the U.S. invaders heavy blows, making them suffer the heaviest defeats.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 27th, Saigon news: On the 25th, the South Vietnamese liberation armed forces heavily defeated two battalions of the U.S. First Infantry Division in Tuyen Duc Province north of Da Lat.

According to Western news agencies, the liberation armed forces caused "heavy casualties" in two of the three U.S. battalions. Among the killed U.S. invaders were a battalion commander and a company commander. The Associated Press reported that initially, a platoon of a U.S. infantry company was attacked and suffered heavy losses. The remaining U.S. soldiers rushed to reinforce but also suffered heavy losses. Then, the U.S. invaders sent two infantry battalions in armored personnel carriers for rescue. However, under the fierce artillery fire of the liberation armed forces, "two armored personnel carriers were destroyed."

In this fierce battle, the liberation armed forces once again demonstrated their close combat power, rendering the U.S. invaders' air support ineffective. Agence France-Presse quoted a Saigon military spokesman as saying that two U.S. aggressor aircraft even mistook four companies of the U.S. First Infantry Division for "enemy forces," dropping napalm bombs on them, causing "moderate to severe damage."

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on the 27th, the South Vietnamese liberation armed forces heavily shelled the command post of the U.S. First Infantry Division's Third Brigade stationed in Da Lat on the evening of August 15, causing the enemy to suffer heavy losses.

In the early hours of the 16th, when the U.S. invaders were still in shock, the liberation armed forces launched a second artillery barrage and simultaneously attacked the U.S. military camp.

According to preliminary reports, the liberation armed forces annihilated 105 U.S. invaders, destroyed 12 helicopters, blew up 10 tents and some barracks.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi, the South Vietnamese liberation armed forces in Quang Nam Province launched a surprise attack on the command post and parking lot of the U.S. invaders' armored division in the early hours of the 17th, located six kilometers southwest of Da Nang.

According to preliminary reports, after a ten-minute extremely heroic battle, the liberation armed forces annihilated nearly 200 U.S. invaders, destroyed 38 M-113 and M-118 amphibious armored vehicles, blew up an ammunition depot, and burned 400 million liters of gasoline.

    南越军民雨季作战一个月歼美军五千
    土龙木省一战重创美国“王牌军”两个营
    炮轰来溪美军旅指挥部歼美军百余　奇袭岘港美装甲团毁装甲车三十八辆
    新华社河内二十七日电　越南《人民报》二十七日在一篇社论中说，越南南方军民在雨季中取得的辉煌胜利，标志着越南南方抗战力量的不断壮大。
    前已报道，仅在雨季的七月份，越南南方解放武装力量就歼灭敌人一万多名，其中包括美国侵略军五千多人。
    社论指出，美国侵略者在遭到具有战略意义的旱季失败后，在雨季中进一步陷入被动的窘境。在各个战场上，美国侵略者连续遭到沉重打击，遭到惨重失败。
    社论说，美国侵略者在雨季中的特点是：在战略上更加被动，在战术上不知所措，士气更加低落。
    社论指出，越南南方解放武装力量的三种部队相互紧密配合越打越有经验，人民战争日益高度发展。游击队和地方部队不仅经常切断敌人的交通线，孤立和包围敌人的基地，而且还粉碎了多营敌人的军事活动，多次消灭敌军的整个单位。
    社论说，美国侵略者在雨季虽然遭到惨败，但是，他们决不会从失败中吸取教训。他们正在策划投下新的赌注。
    社论强调说，越南人民已经做好准备，一定要粉碎美国侵略者对越南南方和北方的一切新的战争计划，随时准备给美国侵略者以沉重的打击，使它遭到最惨重的失败。
    据新华社二十七日讯  西贡消息：越南南方解放武装力量二十五日在土龙木省来溪以北重创美国第一步兵师的两个营。
    据西方通讯社报道，解放武装力量使美军三个营中的两个营“遭受严重伤亡”。在被打死的美国侵略军中包括一个营长和一个连长。美联社的消息说，开始，美国侵略军一个连的一个班受到袭击，伤亡严重。这个连余下的侵略军赶去支援，但是也遭到了严重损失。接着美国侵略军又派两个步兵营乘装甲运输车前往救援。但是，在解放武装力量的猛烈炮火袭击下，“有两辆装甲运输车被击毁。”
    在这场激烈的战斗中，解放武装力量再次发挥了近战的威力，使美国侵略军的空中火力支援失去作用。法新社引用西贡军方发言人的话说，两架美国强盗飞机甚至把美军第一步兵师的四个连“误认为敌军”，向它们投下了凝固汽油弹，造成了“中等至严重程度的损失”。
    据新华社河内二十七日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方土龙木省解放武装力量，八月十五日晚上以猛烈炮火轰击了驻扎在来溪的美国侵略军第一步兵师第三旅指挥部，使敌人遭受重大损失。
    在十六日凌晨当美国侵略军惊魂未定的时候，解放武装力量又向他们进行了第二次炮轰，同时还向美军营地发起了进攻。
    据初步消息，解放武装力量共消灭美国侵略军一百零五名，击毁直升飞机十二架，炸毁十个帐篷和一些营房。
    据新华社河内电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方广南省解放武装力量十七日凌晨奇袭岘港市西南六公里的美国侵略军装甲团指挥部和停车场。
    据初步消息，经过十分钟极其英勇的战斗，解放武装力量共歼灭美国侵略军近二百名，击毁M—113型和M—118型两栖装甲车三十八辆，炸毁一个弹药库和烧毁四百万公升汽油。
