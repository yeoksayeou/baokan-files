	Revolutionaries must be willing to "seek out hardships." Comrade Tan Naishu is exactly like this. During his eight-hour shift, he is always busy, either doing this or that, never idle. Today, he didn't distinguish between your tasks and mine; he worked from the third post to the fourth post. This spirit is worth learning from.

	Upon receiving the dispatch notice, we learned that a heavy snowstorm would arrive in the latter half of the night. We are spirited and calmly preparing measures. Although the snowstorm hasn't arrived yet, even in calm times, we should be in a state of "alert." Only in this way can we cope with all changes and stand unshaken.

	During the self-inspection of the post responsibility system, many shortcomings were found. For example, the heat carrier of the 361st heat exchanger leaked outside, which is a big problem and a major difficulty. The braver we are, the smaller the difficulties become. The more we fear, the bigger the difficulties become. Chairman Mao teaches us to face difficulties head-on. Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we will find a way to solve this problem.

	Today, we need to increase the processing volume. Every comrade understands that this is not just a production task but more importantly a political task, directly related to supporting the Vietnamese people in their struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. Therefore, everyone is resolute, determined to fight this battle, to bring glory to the country, and to bring glory to Chairman Mao. After thorough inspection and preparation, the battle commenced at 9:30 AM.

	From today's increase in volume, we understand: everything must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, emphasize politics, and connect everything with the Chinese Revolution and the world revolution. In this way, we have the power to overcome all difficulties and be invincible. In the face of difficulties, we will not retreat.

	On Duty: Shen Yunqi, Zhang Qingmin

	Recently, our team has encountered some issues that directly threaten the smooth progress of the 200-day operation. This shows that our work is not yet solid enough. Learning from our mistakes and striving to correct our shortcomings is the correct attitude.

	We believe: taking one less step, looking one less time, touching one less time, smelling one less time, is irresponsible to the people's cause.

    革命的岗位
    一九六六年四月十四日
    值班人　刘延波　翟稳
    革命者就是要“自寻苦吃”。谭乃树同志就是这样。他在班上八小时，不是干这，就是干那，从不呆着。今天，他又不分你的活，我的活，都一样干，从三号岗位干到四号岗位。这种风格，值得我们学习。
    一九六六年四月十五日
    值班人　田精敏　王光荣
    接调度通知，后半夜将有大风雪来临。我们精神抖擞，沉着准备措施。虽然现在风雪未到，但就是在风平浪静的时刻，我们也应该处于“戒备”状态，只有这样才能应付万变，立于不败之地……。
    一九六六年五月九日
    值班人　张福开
    岗位责任制自我检查时，找出了许多不足的地方。如三六一号换热器的热载体外漏，这是一个大问题，也是一个大困难。我们勇敢些，困难就小些，我们越害怕，困难就越大。毛主席教导我们要迎着困难去斗争。我们遵循毛主席的教导，想法把这问题解决了。一九六六年五月二十四日值班人　张雨林　谭乃树
    今天要加大处理量。每个同志认识到，这不仅是生产任务，更重要的是政治任务，直接关系到支援越南人民抗美救国斗争问题。因此，人人意志坚强，决心打好这一仗，为国争光，为毛主席争光。经过充分的检查和准备，战斗于九时三十分打响。
    从今天的提量中，体会到：凡事都要遵照毛主席的教导，突出政治，凡事都要和中国革命和世界革命联系起来。这样就有了攻无不克、战无不胜的力量，在困难面前就不会退缩。
    一九六六年六月二十日
    值班人　沈运启　张庆民
    近来本班出了一些事，直接威胁着二百天操作的顺利进展。说明我们的工作还不是非常扎实的。吸取教训，努力改正缺点，才是正确的态度。
    我们认为：少走一步路，少看一眼，少摸一把，少闻一下，就是对人民事业不负责任。
