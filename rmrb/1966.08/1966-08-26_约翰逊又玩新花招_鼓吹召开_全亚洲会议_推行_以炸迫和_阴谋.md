Johnson Plays New Trick
Promotes "All-Asian Conference" to Push "Bombing for Peace" Plot

According to a report from the New China News Agency on the 25th: Washington news: While continuously increasing troops in South Vietnam and intensifying bombing of North Vietnam, U.S. President Johnson personally took the stage on the 24th to promote the so-called "All-Asian Conference," which is secretly orchestrated by the U.S. but proposed by Thailand, "Malaysia," and the Philippines. This is a new plot to push for "bombing for peace."

Johnson emphasized at a press conference in Washington that the U.S. "would be very pleased to see an 'All-Asian Conference' held," and "we will view this matter with an approving attitude, and we believe that holding such a conference is appropriate."

Johnson once again revealed the U.S.'s determination to push the "peace talks" deception. He said, "I am willing to attend any conference held anywhere that I think is beneficial. I will not exclude any location..."

U.S. Secretary of State Rusk, in a speech in New York on the 22nd, also repeated the old tune, saying that the U.S. wants to "seek to bring the other side to the negotiating table. We will continue to explore every possibility for achieving a decent peace."

    约翰逊又玩新花招
    鼓吹召开“全亚洲会议”推行“以炸迫和”阴谋
    据新华社二十五日讯  华盛顿消息：美国总统约翰逊在源源增兵南越和加紧轰炸越南北方的同时，二十四日亲自出马，鼓吹召开美国幕后策划而由泰国、“马来西亚”和菲律宾出面倡议的所谓“全亚洲会议”，推行新的“以炸迫和”的阴谋。
    约翰逊在华盛顿举行的记者招待会上强调说，美国“将非常乐于看到举行一次“全亚洲会议”，“我们将以赞同的心情看待这件事，我们认为举行这样的会议是适宜的。”
    约翰逊再一次表露美国要不遗余力地推行“和谈”骗局。他说：“我愿意参加任何地方举行的、我认为是有益的会议。我不会排斥任何地点……”。
    美国国务卿腊斯克二十二日在纽约发表的一篇演说，也重弹老调说，美国要“谋求使对方坐到会议桌旁来。我们将继续探索实现体面的和平的每一种可能性。”
