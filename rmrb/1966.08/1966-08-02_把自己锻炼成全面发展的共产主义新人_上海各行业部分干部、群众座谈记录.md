The editorial board notes: Chairman Mao teaches us that workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants in all industries should take their main profession as the foundation, learn other skills, learn politics, learn military affairs, learn culture, participate in production labor, and criticize the bourgeoisie. All industries should be transformed into revolutionary schools that are both industrial and agricultural, both cultural and military. They should be schools that cultivate communist new people.

We must definitely follow Chairman Mao's brilliant and historically significant thoughts. By doing so, we can greatly promote the ideological revolution of the 700 million people of our country, further accelerate the construction of socialism in a way that is fast, good, and economical; gradually narrow the gaps between workers and peasants, between urban and rural areas, and between mental and physical labor; make the 700 million people critics of the old world and builders and defenders of the new world; cultivate a generation of new people who are highly politically conscious and all-round developed; more quickly eliminate the social and ideological foundations of capitalism and revisionism, effectively prevent the restoration of capitalism, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and ensure that our country can gradually transition from socialism to communism.

Over the years, many advanced units and individuals in various industries across our country, under the guidance of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and influenced by the shining example of the People's Liberation Army, have practiced in many places in accordance with Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts.

Recently, our newspaper invited some cadres and masses from various industries in Shanghai, including workers, peasants, students, and merchants, for a discussion. We also conducted individual interviews with them, asking them to share their experiences and insights on taking their main profession as the foundation, learning other skills, learning politics, learning military affairs, learning culture, participating in industrial and agricultural production labor, and criticizing the bourgeoisie. Below is a summary of these discussions.

The People's Liberation Army is a shining example of a school of Mao Zedong Thought

The People's Liberation Army, personally founded by Chairman Mao, is an extremely proletarian, extremely revolutionary, and extremely combat-ready shining example. Look, the famous "South Nanjing Road Eighth Company" of the Shanghai Garrison is a vivid example. Deputy Political Instructor Xu Shuren of the Eighth Company spoke, indicating that a company is a school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Xu Shuren said: The People's Liberation Army is a new-type people's army armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao has repeatedly pointed out that the army should fight on one hand, engage in production on the other, and also do mass work. Our army has always maintained and carried forward the glorious tradition of being both a fighting force, a work force, and a production force. After Vice Chairman Lin Biao took over the work of the Central Military Commission in 1960, the entire army responded to Vice Chairman Lin Biao's call to "hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and truly master Mao Zedong Thought," launching a vigorous campaign to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. The red flag of Mao Zedong Thought was raised even higher, and the entire People's Liberation Army became a school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Under the leadership of the Party and higher authorities, our Eighth Company has always advanced in the direction indicated by the Party and Chairman Mao. Since the liberation of Shanghai, after we entered Shanghai, our company not only learned military affairs but also politics and culture. We participated in industrial and agricultural production labor and did mass work, while continuously fighting against bourgeois ideology. New recruits, upon enlisting, were first given Chairman Mao's works as compulsory courses, using works such as "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "In Service of the People," "Moving the Mountains," and "The Class Struggle in Chinese Society" as textbooks. We learned culture and Mao Zedong Thought, changed our worldview, and cultivated them into proletarian revolutionary soldiers loyal to the country, the people, the Party, and the great leader Chairman Mao. Whether during our duty in the urban area of Nanjing Road in Shanghai or during our training and camping in the suburbs, our Eighth Company has always taken the initiative to cultivate more than ten mu of land and raise twenty to thirty pigs, basically achieving self-sufficiency in side dishes. In addition, we have also established ties with many factories and communes, regularly participating in production labor and doing mass work, helping the masses study Chairman Mao's works. In recent years, our company has also continuously sent cadres to take turns participating in the socialist education movement in the suburbs of Shanghai.

During our duty in the urban area, the bourgeoisie tried to poison and "transform" us according to their way of life, hoping to make us "rot, turn black, and decay." Under the leadership of the Party, we have always used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to continuously criticize the bourgeoisie and promote proletarian values. The bourgeoisie tried to tempt us with money, and we resisted with the action of picking up money and not keeping it; the bourgeoisie tried to corrupt us with good food and clothing, and we resisted with the action of thrift and simplicity; the bourgeoisie tried to influence us with the idea of ease and enjoyment, and we resisted with the action of hard work and diligence. In this sharp class struggle, we not only repelled the bourgeoisie's attacks and promoted proletarian righteousness but also passed down the class struggle viewpoint, the noble character of serving the people wholeheartedly, and the fine tradition of hard work from generation to generation.

Xu Shuren said: Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought and through various practical struggles, our Eighth Company has grown. Over the years, just like a school having graduates, our company has a batch of old soldiers retiring each year, and now hundreds of soldiers have been demobilized to work locally. In addition, our Eighth Company has also cultivated a large number of cadres for the army. Demobilized soldiers returning to their hometowns have mostly maintained the character and glorious tradition of revolutionary soldiers, becoming the backbone of the socialist revolution and construction. At the Anhui Provincial Youth League Active Members Conference in 1964, five representatives were soldiers who had retired from our Eighth Company at different times. The famous "restless" Li Zuguang from our company, after being demobilized to work in Shangrao, Jiangxi, was rated as one of the five good workers in Jiangxi's industrial and commercial front and an active learner of Chairman Mao's works.

We deeply feel that only by turning the company into a school of Mao Zedong Thought, learning politics, military affairs, and culture, participating in industrial and agricultural production labor, doing mass work, and criticizing the bourgeoisie, can we cultivate a large number of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. This is the most fundamental measure to ensure that our army will never change color and is the most fundamental preparation for war. In the future, we are determined to advance more bravely on the path of thorough revolutionization in the direction indicated by the Party and Chairman Mao!

The fundamental goal is to gradually narrow the three major gaps

Turning all industries into schools of Mao Zedong Thought fundamentally aims to gradually narrow and ultimately eliminate the three major gaps between workers and peasants, between urban and rural areas, and between mental and physical labor. This will make intellectuals labor-oriented and laborers knowledge-oriented, cultivating and fostering millions of highly politically conscious and all-round developed communist new people. Over the years, various industries have taken measures based on Chairman Mao's teachings, with the People's Liberation Army as an example. They have extensively studied Chairman Mao's works, insisted on participating in production labor, actively engaged in militia activities, and in the thriving proletarian cultural revolution, launched a critique of the bourgeoisie. From these comrades' speeches, it can be seen that under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals are striving towards becoming communist new people.

Shanghai Machine Tool Factory grinder Zhang Meihua said: Starting from the end of 1960, the factory party committee assigned me to engage in scientific research work, focusing on high-precision mirror grinding, a cutting-edge technology in modern machine tool processing. At that time, some people did not take us workers seriously at all, only letting me be their experimental tool, not believing that we workers could master mirror grinding technology. However, I firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teaching: "The responsibility of correctly recognizing and transforming the world has historically fallen on the shoulders of the proletariat and its party." I was determined to fight for the proletariat! Over the years, the workers and young technicians in our mirror grinding group have consistently used Chairman Mao's thoughts as our compass, conducting over 3,000 experiments and research, accumulating a large amount of data needed for manufacturing high-precision mirror grinding machine tools, and mastering a complete set of high-precision mirror grinding processing technologies. This laid the foundation for the birth of China's first high-precision mirror grinding machine tool. This machine tool was successfully trial-produced in our factory last year. The workpieces it processes have a smoothness reaching the highest level in the world today, with a surface as bright and smooth as a mirror. The mirror grinding processing technology has also been promoted in Shanghai. We also wrote a scientific paper guided by the thoughts of Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction" and "On Practice" in the study of mirror grinding technology. The factory leadership also sent me to Shanghai Industrial University to teach half-work half-study.

Reviewing this period of practice and learning Chairman Mao's instructions, workers should take their work as the main focus, learn military affairs, politics, and culture. They should also engage in socialist education and criticize the bourgeoisie. I feel particularly close to this. We workers must cultivate ourselves into communist new people by following the bright path indicated by the Party and Chairman Mao. The lack of knowledge and culture among the working people is the result of thousands of years of evil exploitative systems. Only when the working people master Mao Zedong Thought, learn politics, military affairs, and culture, and criticize the bourgeoisie, can they stride confidently onto the stage of scientific experimentation, become the masters of science, culture, and technology, and in the realm of ideology, overthrow the reactionary bourgeois "authorities" and realize the dictatorship over the bourgeoisie. Only in this way can we working people, while engaging in physical labor, also engage in mental labor, gradually eliminating the gap between mental and physical labor.

Both industrial and agricultural, both cultural and military, cultivating communist new people

East China Normal University student Jie Liancheng said: Chairman Mao calls on us students to take learning as the main focus, learn other skills, that is, not only learn literature but also learn industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and criticize the bourgeoisie. In my five years of university study and practice, I deeply feel that only by turning the school into this kind of institution can it cultivate the successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause that the Party needs and cultivate communist new people. In these five years, for the first three years, we were led by the nose by the bourgeois "authorities," who kept us locked in the school all year round, forcing us to bury our heads in books, not allowing us to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, not letting us participate in production labor, and not allowing us to come into contact with reality. Most of the students in our class are children of workers and peasants, but after three years of study, some of our classmates became their "captives," transformed by them. The workers' and peasants' feelings became weaker, their lives became more Westernized, their bodies became weaker, and their knowledge became more empty. As a result, the distance between us and socialism, communism, and Mao Zedong Thought became greater, while the distance between us and capitalism and revisionism became closer.

It was only after 1964 that the school party committee, based on the Party's and Chairman Mao's instructions, organized us to go to the countryside to participate in the socialist education movement and organized us to join the army. This March, our department went to the countryside to carry out educational reforms in the humanities; now we are also carrying out the proletarian cultural revolution in the school, criticizing the bourgeoisie. In the three great revolutionary movements, we actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm our minds, transforming both the subjective and objective worlds. In this way, we began to break free from the control and restraint of the bourgeois "authorities." Although it has only been a short two years, the education and training we have received is incomparable to the previous three years. The students' feelings for Chairman Mao's works have deepened, their class consciousness has increased, their labor outlook has strengthened, and their practical work skills have also improved.

We firmly believe that as long as we insist on doing this, not only learning literature but also industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and criticizing the bourgeoisie, our school can gradually become a university that cultivates communist new people. We can also gradually cultivate ourselves into new people who not only have communist consciousness and culture but also can engage in physical labor, and we will never become spiritual aristocrats who stand above the working people.

Shanghai Radio Factory Deputy Director Chen Xiangbao said: Our factory began implementing a new system in the later stage of the socialist education movement in May 1965, consisting of one leadership team, two sets of cadres, and rotating as workers. All workshop directors, section chiefs, and middle-level and above leaders in the factory, including Party, government, trade union, and youth league cadres, work one week and labor one day; one set is sent down to work as ordinary workers, settling in groups, eating, living, working, and studying with the workers, completely appearing as ordinary laborers. The two sets of cadres rotate regularly, being both cadres and workers.

Chen Xiangbao also said: I started working as an apprentice at the age of fourteen and worked as a maintenance worker in a textile mill. However, after working as a cadre for a few years, I rarely engaged in labor, and my proletarian feelings became weaker. Usually, when deciding on issues, I rarely consulted with the workers. After implementing the new system, I went to the second workshop, class B, to learn skills from the workers, settling in for labor, and doing the same as the workers in three aspects: preparation before class, sweeping the floor, tidying up tools, and doing various odd jobs. Production labor is the same, seriously mastering the operation technology of the universal grinding machine. After class, participating in activities is the same, studying Chairman Mao's works with the workers, living a democratic life together, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, visiting workers' families, and also practicing martial arts, playing ball, and swimming with young people.

After implementing this new system, the workers generally felt it was very good! Such cultivated cadres can go up and down, can do leadership work, and can also work as ordinary workers, can take root among the people, and take root in labor. After a period of practice, we also deeply felt that after working with the workers for a relatively long time, we became more harmonious with the workers in our thoughts and lives, had a deeper understanding of the people's sufferings, and enhanced our class feelings with the workers. At the same time, the workers' supervision of us also strengthened. At the end of last year, after I rotated back to work, because I had the people in my heart, the subjectivity and bureaucracy in my work also decreased.

As long as we hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and insist on this rotation year after year, being both cadres and workers, being able to manage and labor, being able to go up and down, we can ensure that cadres will never change, prevent the emergence of revisionism, and cultivate a new type of cadre.

Everyone criticizes the bourgeoisie

During the discussions and interviews, everyone talked about how Chairman Mao calls on everyone to criticize the bourgeoisie and learn military affairs. These two points are of great significance in ensuring that the socialist revolution is carried out to the end. Only in this way can we thoroughly smash the bourgeoisie's restoration plot and be ready at any time to bury imperialism and its running dogs in the vast sea of people's war, defending the socialist mountains and rivers.

Shanghai Fruit and Grocery Company Zhabei District Company Manager Zhou Xingli said: Chairman Mao teaches us that "without destruction, there can be no construction; without blocking, there can be no flow; without stopping, there can be no progress." To carry out the socialist revolution to the end, to completely eliminate the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, the 700 million people must use Mao Zedong Thought as the sharpest weapon to criticize the bourgeoisie, criticize reactionary bourgeois "experts" and "authorities," and criticize the old world. Without completely eliminating all bourgeois things, the proletariat's everything cannot be established, and the socialist revolution cannot be carried out to the end. This is an absolute truth. All exploiting classes are unwilling to accept their failure and always try every means to restore their lost "heaven." The more our socialist revolution is victorious and the more prosperous our socialist cause is, the more the bourgeoisie will struggle desperately. They always try to poison the masses with the old thoughts and habits of the exploiting classes to achieve the goal of capitalist restoration.

In our commercial front, this struggle against restoration and counter-restoration is also very sharp, complex, and intense. In the past few years, the bourgeoisie attempted to carry out restoration in our commercial departments, advocating the reactionary slogan of using capitalist management for socialism, saying that things like short-weighting, substituting inferior goods, and other capitalist "business tricks" can also "accumulate" funds for socialism and "serve" the revolution and construction. This reactionary slogan is advocating profit-seeking, advocating greed, advocating trickery, destroying the Party's policies, destroying the reputation of socialist commerce, and destroying the relationship between the Party and the masses. If we do not thoroughly expose and criticize it, Chairman Mao's overall financial and economic work policy of "developing the economy and ensuring supply" cannot be implemented, and there is a danger of socialist commerce degenerating into capitalist commerce.

In this proletarian cultural revolution, the employees of our company, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have resolutely fought against various forms of capitalist business ideas. They have smashed bourgeois ideology and established proletarian ideology, smashed capitalist "business tricks," and established the high reputation of socialist commerce.

As long as we workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants all become critics of the old world, the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, no matter when they attempt to carry out counter-revolutionary restoration, the 700 million people will rise up together, jointly condemn them, and jointly exterminate them, thoroughly defeating them.

While producing, also learning military affairs

Baoshan County Wusong Commune female member He Jinying is a member of the Shanghai Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Association, deputy political instructor of the militia company, deputy squad leader of the Wusong Women's Militia Sharpshooters, a first-class sharpshooter, and a production leader.

He Jinying said: In 1962, after graduating from junior high school, I responded to the Party's call and returned to the countryside to engage in agricultural production. Under the Party's cultivation and education, I studied Chairman Mao's works, learned production technology, engaged in scientific farming, and learned military affairs, participating in the women's militia shooting class.

Chairman Mao said: "Imperialists bully us like this, and we must seriously deal with them. We not only need a strong regular army, but we also need to establish a large number of militia regiments. In this way, when imperialists invade our country, they will find it difficult to move an inch." The militia of our Wusong Commune has, over the years, followed Chairman Mao's instructions, studying Mao Zedong Thought on one hand, producing on the other, and learning military affairs. Wusong Port is the gate to Shanghai and the frontline of national coastal defense. Imperialist bandits have always been the first to invade Shanghai. To defend our socialist mountains and rivers and support the world revolution, over the years, regardless of the scorching summer or the bitter winter, whether it is windy or rainy, we always carry our class hatred and national resentment, practicing martial arts in the places where imperialists once climbed, practicing in the places where our relatives were killed, practicing on the ruins of houses burned by the enemy, and practicing in front of the graves of revolutionary martyrs. We concentrate our blood hatred on the gun muzzle, regard the shooting range as the battlefield, regard the target as Johnson, Chiang Kai-shek, and smash it to pieces!

All industries should be armed with Chairman Mao's people's war thoughts, with everyone learning military affairs, implementing universal military training, and solidly preparing for war, achieving "calling them and they come, coming and they can fight, fighting and they can win." If imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionary forces from various countries dare to touch us, we will definitely make them come and not be able to leave!

Chairman Mao instructs all industries to become revolutionary schools that are both industrial and agricultural, both cultural and military. This is our program. During the discussions and interviews, everyone agreed that implementing this instruction cannot avoid the stubborn resistance of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. This is a long-term, sharp, complex, and intense class struggle. We must use Mao Zedong Thought as the sharpest weapon to complete this earth-shaking revolution.

Chairman Mao's book supports us every step of the way

Zhang Meihua said: Working people not only engage in physical labor but also need to understand politics, military affairs, and culture, and ascend to the stage of science and technology, becoming all-round developed communist new people. This is an unprecedented great revolution in human history, a great and earth-shaking event. The representatives of the bourgeoisie and reactionary bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" want to rule over us, of course, they will do everything they can to oppose us from doing this. However, with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, we will definitely defeat them and achieve this great goal!

Chairman Mao's book supports the working people every step of the way, and every sentence strengthens our courage! With Mao Zedong Thought arming our minds, we working people are the bravest, daring to think, dare to act, dare to pioneer, dare to revolutionize, daring to break through difficulties and forge ahead. With Mao Zedong Thought arming our minds, we working people are the smartest, able to unleash boundless creativity.

On the road of socialist revolution and construction, we must learn from the good soldier of Chairman Mao, Liu Yingjun, and strive to study Mao Zedong Thought, faithfully implement Mao Zedong Thought, enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought, bravely defend Mao Zedong Thought, and forever hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought!

He Jinying said: We must firmly grasp the three weapons—hoes, guns, and pens, protect the printing press, build a new socialist countryside, and the key is that we must have a heart armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

With the great Mao Zedong Thought arming our hearts, we can firmly grasp the gun, fearing neither imperialism nor modern revisionism nor reactionary forces from various countries. Once war breaks out, we can fight together with the People's Liberation Army, thoroughly, completely, and entirely annihilate all invading robbers. With the great Mao Zedong Thought arming our hearts, we can firmly grasp the hoe, not believing in evil, not believing in ghosts, fighting against heaven and earth, overcoming all difficulties, and striving to build a new socialist countryside. With the great Mao Zedong Thought arming our hearts, we can firmly grasp the pen, publish wall newspapers, establish cultural rooms, tell revolutionary stories, vigorously propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and at the same time, launch a fierce attack on all anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought black gangs, thoroughly eliminating the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits existing in the countryside.

Zhou Xingli said: We criticize the old world and the bourgeoisie with the only sharp weapon, Mao Zedong Thought. The 700 million people in our country use Mao Zedong Thought as the sharpest weapon to criticize the bourgeoisie, only then can we, to the greatest extent, clean up the dust left by the bourgeoisie in every corner, and to the greatest depth, uproot the ideological consciousness of the exploiting classes that have monopolized and ruled for thousands of years.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "'Daring to be skinned alive, daring to pull the emperor off his horse,' we must have this fearless spirit when fighting for socialism and communism." In implementing the Party's and Chairman Mao's instructions on cultivating communist new people and in the life-and-death class struggle of criticizing the bourgeoisie, we must greatly promote this revolutionary and fighting spirit! We warn those bourgeois lords that if you dare to obstruct us from carrying out the socialist revolution to the end and obstruct us from turning all industries into schools of Mao Zedong Thought, no matter what flag you raise, what flowery words you use, or what tricks you play, we will all defeat you and throw you into the garbage heap of history!

    把自己锻炼成全面发展的共产主义新人
    上海各行业部分干部、群众座谈记录
    编者按：毛主席教导我们，工农兵学商各行各业，都要以本业为主，兼学别样，都要学政治，学军事，学文化，都要参加生产劳动，都要批判资产阶级。各行各业，都要办成亦工亦农、亦文亦武的革命化的大学校，办成培养共产主义新人的大学校。
    我们一定要按照毛主席这一具有伟大历史意义的光辉思想去做。这样，就能大大促进我国七亿人民的思想革命化，进一步又多又快又好又省地建设社会主义；就能逐步缩小工农差别、城乡差别、体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别；就能使七亿人民成为旧世界的批判者，新世界的建设者和保卫者；就能培养出具有高度政治觉悟的、全面发展的一代新人；就能更快地铲除资本主义、修正主义的社会基础和思想基础，有效地防止资本主义复辟，巩固无产阶级专政，并保证我国能够由社会主义逐步过渡到共产主义。
    多年来，我国各行各业的许多先进单位和先进人物，在党中央和毛主席的教导下，在解放军光辉榜样的影响下，他们的实践在许多地方是符合毛主席这一光辉思想的。
    最近，本报邀请上海工农兵学商各行各业的部分干部和群众，进行了座谈，并向他们作了个别访问，请他们谈了自己以本业为主，兼学别样，学政治，学军事，学文化，又从事工农业生产劳动，又批判资产阶级的心得和体会。下面就是这些谈话的摘要。
    解放军是毛泽东思想  大学校的光辉榜样
    毛主席亲手缔造的中国人民解放军，是非常无产阶级化，非常革命化，非常战斗化的光辉榜样，也是毛泽东思想大学校的光辉榜样。请看，著名的上海警备区某部“南京路上好八连”就是一个生动的典型。八连副指导员徐树仁的谈话表明，一个连队就是一所毛泽东思想的大学校。
    徐树仁说：中国人民解放军，是毛泽东思想武装起来的新型人民军队。毛主席早就一再指出，军队一方面打仗，一方面生产，同时又要做群众工作。我军一直保持和发扬了“既是战斗队，又是工作队，又是生产队”的光荣传统。一九六○年林彪副主席主持中央军委工作以后，全军响应林彪副主席“高举毛泽东思想红旗，把毛泽东思想真正学到手”的号召，掀起了轰轰烈烈活学活用毛主席著作的热潮，毛泽东思想红旗举得更高了，整个解放军就是一所毛泽东思想的大学校。
    我们八连在党和上级的领导下，一直按照党和毛主席指示的方向前进。自从上海解放，我们进驻上海以后，我们连队不仅学军事，也学政治，学文化，既参加工农业生产劳动，又做群众工作，同时不断地对资产阶级思想进行斗争。新战士一入伍，我们首先把毛主席的著作作为他们的必修课，以《纪念白求恩》《为人民服务》《愚公移山》《中国社会各阶级的分析》等著作为教材，既学文化，又学毛泽东思想，改造世界观，培养他们成为忠于祖国，忠于人民，忠于党，忠于伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级革命战士。不论在上海市区南京路执勤期间，还是在郊区训练野营期间，我们八连一直自己动手，种着十多亩地，养着二三十头猪，基本上做到了副食品自给。此外，我们还和许多工厂、公社挂钩，定期去参加生产劳动，进行群众工作，帮助群众学习毛主席著作。近几年，我们连队还不断派出干部轮流参加上海郊区农村的社会主义教育运动。
    我们连队在市区执勤期间，资产阶级曾经企图按他们的生活方式来毒化我们，“改造”我们，妄想使我们“发霉、发黑、烂掉”。我们在党的领导下，一直以毛泽东思想为武器，不断地批判资产阶级，兴无灭资。资产阶级想用金钱引诱我们，我们就用拾金不昧的行动来同他们对抗；资产阶级想用吃好的穿好的来腐蚀我们，我们就用勤俭节约、艰苦朴素的行动来同他们斗争；资产阶级想用安逸享乐的思想来影响我们，我们就用辛勤劳动、刻苦工作的行动来抵制他们。在这场尖锐的阶级斗争中，我们不仅打退了资产阶级的进攻，发扬了无产阶级的正气，而且使阶级和阶级斗争的观点、全心全意为人民服务的高贵品德、艰苦奋斗的优良作风，一代一代地传下来了。
    徐树仁说：在毛泽东思想的哺育下，在各种实际斗争的锻炼中，我们八连在成长。几年来，就象学校有毕业生一样，我们连队每年都有一批老战士退伍，现在已经有几百名战士复员到地方工作。另外，我们八连还为部队培养出大批干部。复员的战士回到地方，绝大部分人保持着革命战士的本色和我军的光荣传统，成了社会主义革命和建设的骨干。一九六四年安徽举行的全省共青团积极分子大会上，就有五个代表是不同时期从我们八连退伍的战士。过去我们连队有名的“闲不住”李祖根，复员到江西上饶市工作后，被评为江西省工交战线的五好职工、学习毛主席著作积极分子。
    我们深深体会到，只有把连队办成毛泽东思想的大学校，学政治，学军事，学文化，又参加工农业生产劳动，又做群众工作，又批判资产阶级，这样才能培养造就出大批无产阶级革命事业的接班人。这是保证我军永不变色的最根本措施，也是最根本的战备。今后，我们决心朝着党和毛主席指引的方向，在彻底革命化的大道上更加奋勇地前进！
      根本的目的是要逐步缩小三大差别
    把各行各业都办成毛泽东思想的大学校，根本目的在于逐步缩小并最后消灭工农之间、城乡之间、脑力劳动和体力劳动之间的三大差别，使知识分子劳动化，劳动人民知识化，培养和造就出有高度政治觉悟的、全面发展的千千万万共产主义新人。几年来，各行各业根据毛主席的教导，以解放军为榜样，采取了一些重大的措施。他们大学毛主席著作，坚持参加生产劳动，积极开展民兵活动。在蓬蓬勃勃的无产阶级文化大革命中，展开了对资产阶级的批判。从这些同志的发言中可以看出，广大工农兵群众、革命干部和革命知识分子，在毛泽东思想指引下，正朝着作共产主义新人的方向努力。
    上海机床厂磨工张梅华说：一九六○年年底开始，厂党委要我去从事科学研究工作，攻高精度镜面磨削这一近代机械加工的尖端技术。当时，有些人根本不把我们工人放在眼里，只让我当他们的试验工具，不相信我们工人能掌握镜面磨削技术。可是，我牢记毛主席的这一教导：“社会的发展到了今天的时代，正确地认识世界和改造世界的责任，已经历史地落在无产阶级及其政党的肩上。”我下定决心要为无产阶级争气！这几年，我们镜面磨削小组的几个工人和青年技术人员，自始至终以毛主席的思想作指南针，前后进行了三千多次试验研究，积累了制造高精度镜面磨削机床需要的大量数据，又掌握了一整套高精度镜面磨削加工工艺，为我国第一台高精度镜面磨削机床的诞生，奠定了基础。这台机床去年已在我们厂试制成功，它加工出来的工件，光洁度达到目前世界上最高一级，表面象镜子一样明亮光滑。镜面磨削的加工工艺，也在上海推广了。我们并写成了用毛主席《矛盾论》《实践论》的思想指导镜面磨削技术研究的科学论文。厂领导还让我到上海市半工半读工业大学去讲课。
    回顾这一段的实践，再学习毛主席的指示，工人以工为主，兼学军事、政治、文化。也要搞社会主义教育运动，也要批判资产阶级。我感到特别亲切。我们工人要把自己锻炼成共产主义的新人，只有走党和毛主席所指引的这条光明大道。劳动人民没有知识，没有文化，是千百年罪恶的剥削制度造成的。只有劳动人民掌握了毛泽东思想，学政治，学军事，学文化，又批判资产阶级，昂首阔步地走上科学实验的舞台，做科学文化技术的主人，才能在意识形态的一切领域，打倒反动的资产阶级“权威”，实现对资产阶级的专政。也只有这样，我们劳动人民才能在从事体力劳动的同时，也从事脑力劳动，逐步消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别。
    亦工亦农，亦文亦武，造就共产主义新人
    华东师范大学学生接连城说：毛主席号召我们学生，以学为主，兼学别样，即不但学文，也要学工、学农、学军，也要批判资产阶级。我在五年大学学习实践中，深深体会到，学校只有办成这样，才能培养出党所需要的无产阶级革命事业的接班人，才能培养出共产主义的新人。这五年中，前三年，我们被资产阶级的“权威”老爷们牵着鼻子走，他们把我们整年、整月地关在学校里，强迫我们埋头读书，不许我们活学活用毛主席著作，不要我们参加生产劳动，不让我们接触实际。我们这个年级绝大多数学生都是工农子弟，但是经过三年学习，有的同学作了他们的“俘虏”，被他们“改造”了。工农思想感情从浓到淡，生活从“土”到“洋”，身体也从强到弱，知识也从实到空。结果是我们和社会主义、共产主义，和毛泽东思想的距离越来越远，而和资本主义、修正主义的距离倒越来越近了。
    只是到了一九六四年以后，学校党委根据党和毛主席的指示，才组织我们到农村参加社会主义教育运动，组织我们下连队当兵。今年三月我们系到农村办学，搞文科教学革命；现在又在学校内搞无产阶级文化大革命，批判资产阶级。在三大革命运动中，我们活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，改造主观世界和客观世界。这样，我们才开始冲破了资产阶级“权威”老爷们的统治和束缚。到现在虽然只有短短两年，但我们所受到的教育和锻炼，是前三年根本不能相比的。同学们对毛主席著作的感情加深了，阶级觉悟提高了，劳动观点加强了，实际工作的本领也增长了。
    我们深信，只要坚持这样做下去，不仅学文，也学工、学农、学军，也批判资产阶级。我们的学校就可以逐步成为培养共产主义新人的大学。我们也可以逐步锻炼成为不仅有共产主义觉悟，有文化，还能从事体力劳动的新人，而绝不会成为那种高踞于劳动人民之上的精神贵族。
    上海无线电三厂副厂长陈祥宝说：我们厂在一九六五年五月社会主义教育运动后期，开始实行一套领导班子、两套干部、轮换当工人的新制度。全厂车间主任、科长和厂一级党政工团等中层以上领导干部，一套在上面当班抓工作，每周劳动一天；一套下放当工人，落户到小组，和工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同活动、同学习，完全以普通劳动者的姿态出现。两套干部，定期轮换，既是干部，又是工人。
    陈祥宝又说：我十四岁开始当学徒，在纺织厂做过保全工。可是，当了几年干部，很少劳动，无产阶级思想感情就淡薄了。平时决定什么问题，很少与工人商量。一实行了新制度，我就到二车间乙班磨床小组拜师学艺，落户劳动，和工人做到“三个一样”：班前准备一个样，扫地，收拾工具，做各种杂活。生产劳动一个样，认真掌握万能工具磨床的操作技术。班后参加活动一个样，同工人一起学习毛主席著作，一起过民主生活，开展批评与自我批评，一起访问工人家庭，还和青年人一起练武、打球、游泳。
    实行了这个新制度，工人们普遍反映好得很！这样培养出来的干部，能上能下，既可以做领导工作，又可以当工人，能扎根在群众之中，扎根在劳动之中。经过一段时期的实践，我们也深深感到，经过比较长时间地同工人一起劳动，我们在思想上和生活上同工人更融洽了，对群众疾苦的感受比过去更深切了，与工人的阶级感情也增进了，同时工人群众对我们的监督也加强了。去年年底，我轮换当班抓工作以后，由于心里有了群众，工作中的主观片面和官僚主义也减少了。
    只要我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，照这样年复一年地坚持轮换下去，既当干部，又当工人，既会管理，又会劳动，能上能下，就能保证干部永不变质，防止产生修正主义，就能造就一批新型的干部。
    人人批判资产阶级
    在座谈、访问中，大家纷纷谈到，毛主席号召人人都要批判资产阶级，人人都要学军事，这两条对于保证把社会主义革命进行到底，具有十分重大的意义。只有这样，才能彻底粉碎资产阶级的复辟阴谋，才能随时准备好用人民战争的汪洋大海去埋葬帝国主义及其走狗，保卫社会主义江山。
    上海市果品杂货公司闸北区公司经理周信礼说：毛主席教导我们，不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行。要把社会主义革命进行到底，把资产阶级和一切剥削阶级彻底消灭，七亿人民都要用毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器，批判资产阶级，批判反动的资产阶级“专家”、“权威”，批判旧世界。不把各种资产阶级的东西彻底破除，无产阶级的一切就立不起来，社会主义革命就不能进行到底。这是千真万确的真理。一切剥削阶级总是不甘心自己的失败，总是千方百计妄想恢复它们失去的“天堂”。我们社会主义革命越是胜利，社会主义事业越是兴旺，资产阶级就越是要垂死挣扎。他们总是妄想用剥削阶级的旧思想、旧习惯毒害群众，达到资本主义复辟的目的。
    在我们商业战线上，这场复辟反复辟的斗争，也是十分尖锐、复杂和激烈的。前几年，资产阶级妄图在我们商业部门搞复辟，提出所谓资本主义经营管理为社会主义所用的反动口号，说什么缺斤短两、以次充好等一套资本主义的“生意经”，也能为社会主义“积累”资金，为革命和建设“服务”。这个反动口号，是在宣扬利润挂帅，宣扬唯利是图，宣扬投机取巧，破坏党的政策，破坏社会主义商业的信誉，破坏党和群众的关系。如果不对它彻底揭露、彻底批判，毛主席提出的“发展经济，保障供给”的财经工作总方针就不能贯彻执行，社会主义商业就有蜕变成为资本主义商业的危险。
    在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，我们公司职工以毛泽东思想为武器，与形形色色资本主义经营思想作了坚决的斗争。破了资产阶级思想，树立了无产阶级思想，破了资本主义“生意经”，就立了社会主义商业的崇高信誉。
    只要我们工农兵学商都成为旧世界的批判者，资产阶级及一切剥削阶级，无论在什么时候企图搞反革命复辟，七亿人民就能一齐奋起，共讨之，共诛之，彻底打倒他们。
    一面搞生产一面学军事
    宝山县吴淞公社女社员何金英，是上海市贫农下中农协会的委员，大队民兵连副政治指导员，吴淞女民兵神枪手班的副班长，是特等射手，也是生产上的闯将。
    何金英说：一九六二年，我初中毕业以后，响应党的号召，回乡参加农业生产。在党的培养教育下，我学习毛主席著作；学习生产技术，搞科学种田；学习军事，参加女民兵射击班。
    毛主席说：“帝国主义者如此欺负我们，这是需要认真对付的。我们不但要有强大的正规军，我们还要大办民兵师。这样，在帝国主义侵略我国的时候，就会使他们寸步难行。”我们吴淞公社的民兵，这几年就是按照毛主席的指示，一面学习毛泽东思想，一面生产，一面学习军事。吴淞口是上海的大门，是祖国的海防前哨，帝国主义强盗历次侵略上海，这里总是首当其冲。为了保卫我们的社会主义江山，为了支援世界革命，几年来，不论三伏盛暑，还是三九严冬，不管是刮风，还是下雨，我们都带着阶级仇、民族恨，在当年帝国主义爬上来的地方练武，在自己亲人被杀害的地方练武，在被敌人烧过的旧屋基上练武，在革命烈士的墓前练武。我们把血海深仇凝结在枪口上，把靶场看成战场，把目标比作约翰逊、蒋介石，将它打个粉碎！
    各行各业都用毛主席的人民战争思想武装起来，人人都学军事，实行全民皆兵，扎扎实实地做好打仗的准备，做到“召之即来，来之能战，战之能胜”，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派胆敢来碰一碰，一定叫它们有来的，没去的！
    毛主席指示各行各业要办成亦工亦农，亦文亦武的革命化大学校，这就是我们的纲领。在座谈、访问中，大家一致认为，实现这个指示不能不遇到资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的负隅顽抗，这是一场长期、尖锐、复杂、激烈的阶级斗争。我们一定要用毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器，完成这场翻天覆地的革命。
    毛主席的书字字撑我们的腰
    张梅华说：劳动人民不但能从事体力劳动，而且要懂政治，懂军事，掌握文化，登上科学技术的舞台，成为全面发展的共产主义新人。这是人类历史上空前伟大的革命，是翻天覆地的大事。资产阶级代表人物和反动的资产阶级“专家”、“权威”，妄想骑在我们头上统治我们，当然是要千方百计反对我们这样做的。但是，我们有了战无不胜的毛泽东思想作武器，一定能够把他们打得落花流水，实现这个宏伟的目标！
    毛主席的书，字字撑我们劳动人民的腰，句句壮我们劳动人民的胆！用毛泽东思想武装头脑，我们劳动人民就最勇敢，敢想、敢作、敢闯、敢革命，敢于披荆斩棘，勇往直前。用毛泽东思想武装头脑，我们劳动人民就最聪明，能发挥出无穷无尽的创造力。
    在社会主义革命和建设的征途上，我们要以毛主席的好战士刘英俊同志为榜样，努力地学习毛泽东思想，忠实地贯彻毛泽东思想，热情地宣传毛泽东思想，勇敢地捍卫毛泽东思想，把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗永远高高举起！
    何金英说：我们要紧握三根杆子——锄杆子、枪杆子、笔杆子，要保卫印把子，要建设社会主义新农村，关键的关键在于我们的胸中要有一颗用毛泽东思想武装起来的红心。
    有了伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的红心，我们才能紧握枪杆子，不怕帝国主义，不怕现代修正主义，不怕各国反动派，一旦发生战争，我们就能与人民解放军一起共同战斗，彻底，干净，全部地消灭一切侵略强盗。有了伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的红心，我们才能紧握锄杆子，不信邪，不信鬼，与天斗，与地斗，排除万难，发奋建设社会主义新农村。有了伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的红心，我们才能紧握笔杆子，办墙报，建文化室，讲革命故事，大力宣传毛泽东思想，同时向一切反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的黑帮猛烈开火，彻底扫除农村里存在的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯。
    周信礼说：我们批判旧世界，批判资产阶级，唯一锐利的武器，就是毛泽东思想。我国七亿人民都用毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器批判资产阶级，才能在最大的广度上把资产阶级留藏在每个角落的灰尘打扫干净，才能在最大的深度上把几千年来居于垄断和统治地位的剥削阶级意识形态连根拔除。
    毛主席教导我们：“‘舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马’，我们在为社会主义共产主义而斗争的时候，必须有这种大无畏的精神。”在贯彻执行党和毛主席关于培养共产主义新人的指示中，在批判资产阶级的你死我活的阶级斗争中，我们一定要大大发扬这种革命的战斗的精神！我们正告那些资产阶级老爷们，你们胆敢阻挡我们把社会主义革命进行到底，胆敢阻挡我们把各行各业办成毛泽东思想的大学校，不管你们打着什么样的旗号，搬弄什么样的花言巧语，施展什么样的阴谋诡计，我们都要把你们统统打倒，把你们扔到历史的垃圾堆里！
