Over the past few days, the Hebei Province delegation has been visiting and touring rural factories in the Lhasa region, meeting and chatting with many Tibetan brothers.

The Tibetan people regard the arrival of their Hebei Province brothers to the plateau as a great joyous event. Wherever the delegation goes, joyous scenes appear. Many Tibetan brothers, holding bouquets, waving colorful flags, and raising high portraits of Chairman Mao, come singing and dancing to welcome them. They enthusiastically shout, "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" The delegation members and workers together dig soil and push carts on the construction site, participating in production and construction. They also plant "ethnic unity" apple trees together in the orchard. The delegation members were also invited to visit the homes of Tibetan brothers, where they had heart-to-heart talks about their experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works and the changes between the old and new societies.

Zhang Guohua, the first secretary of the Communist Party of Tibet Autonomous Region Committee, received the Hebei Province delegation and had a cordial conversation with them, expressing warm welcome and heartfelt thanks.

    河北省访问团热情会见藏族兄弟
    据新华社拉萨电　连日来，河北省访问团在拉萨地区参观访问农村工厂，同广大藏族兄弟见面谈心。
    藏族人民把河北省兄弟来到高原，看作是一件大喜事。访问团到哪里，哪里就出现欢乐的景象。许多藏族兄弟手持花束，打着彩旗，高举毛主席象，载歌载舞地赶来欢迎，他们热情欢呼：“中国共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”访问团团员和工人农民一起在工地上挖土、推车，参加生产建设，又在果园里一起栽起了“民族团结”苹果树。团员们还应邀到藏族兄弟家做客，倾心交谈学习毛主席著作的心得和新旧社会的变化。
    中共西藏自治区委员会第一书记张国华接见了河北省访问团，同他们进行了亲切的交谈，向他们表示热烈的欢迎和衷心的感谢。
