The 18th of August was a day of great joy. At one o'clock in the morning, the procession of workers from the capital had already arrived at Tiananmen Square and Chang'an Street. Many people had stayed up all night, some even without changing out of their work clothes or having a meal. They eagerly awaited the chance to see our great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao.

Golden sunlight bathed Tiananmen Gate, and Chairman Mao, dressed in a green military uniform, appeared on the rostrum. Amidst a chorus of cheers, the driver of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, Cai Lianxing, was clapping, jumping, and shouting. Today, their locomotive was scheduled to run, and the team members unanimously decided to take over his work and nominate him to attend the meeting to report to Chairman Mao. Cai Lianxing excitedly said, "This year marks the 20th anniversary of the naming of our 'Mao Zedong' locomotive. Over the past 20 years, we have always felt that Chairman Mao is by our side, inspiring us to brave the storms, overcome all difficulties, and forge ahead courageously. Today, our most beloved Chairman Mao is with us celebrating the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is the greatest encouragement for us, adding immense strength to our resolve. We will definitely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to study Chairman Mao's works more conscientiously and apply them in practice, ensuring that the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought forever waves over our locomotive."

"We must be the vanguard of the Cultural Revolution and the pioneers of production and construction! We have boundless confidence in liberating ourselves!" These are the proud words of the workers from Beijing's First Rolling Mill. They described their recent mood as boiling like molten steel. Eight days ago, many of them had the fortune of seeing Chairman Mao at the reception center of the Party Central Committee. Some even shook hands with him. The entire factory regarded this meeting as the most unforgettable moment of their lives, with everyone feeling an inexhaustible surge of energy. Today, seeing Chairman Mao again at Tiananmen, they jumped up and shouted, "Long live the greatest leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" They were reluctant to leave.

In the workers' procession, there appeared a giant model of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," with Chairman Mao's portrait shining brilliantly on the cover. Last night, workers from the Beijing Chemical Enamel Factory gathered to discuss what to bring to the parade to fully express the workers' sentiments. They already had Mao's portrait, copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," placards, banners, drums, and gongs, but they still felt it was not enough. They unanimously decided to make a large model of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." The worker Hu Baoming, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, led a group of people to start working immediately. Some designed, others crafted, and still others painted, working until midnight. The workers said: The invincible Mao Zedong Thought will forever be our guiding principle in all our work. Only by holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought can we fully unleash our wisdom and strength, smash the old world, and build a new one.

　　一生最难忘的时刻
    八月十八日是个大喜的日子。午夜一点，首都工人的游行队伍，就已经来到天安门广场和长安街上。许多人通宵未眠，有的连工作服也来不及换，连饭也顾不上吃。他们急切地等待着看望我们伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席。
    金色的阳光照射到天安门，毛主席穿着一身草绿色的军装出现在城楼上。在一片欢呼声中，“毛泽东”号机车司机长蔡连兴也是拍手啊，跳啊，喊啊。今天他们机车要出车，小组工人们一致要求把他的工作包下来，推选他来参加大会，好好向毛主席汇报。蔡连兴激动地说：“今年刚好是我们‘毛泽东’号机车命名二十周年。二十年来，我们时时刻刻都感到毛主席就在我们的身边，鼓舞着我们迎着风雨，排除万难，勇猛前进。今天，最最敬爱的毛主席和我们在一起庆祝无产阶级文化大革命，这是对我们最大的鼓舞，给我们增添了无比的力量。我们一定响应林彪同志的号召，更自觉地活学活用毛主席著作，让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗永远永远地飘扬在我们机车上。”
      “我们一定要当文化大革命的尖兵，生产建设中的闯将，我们有百倍的信心自己解放自己！”这是北京第一轧钢厂工人的十分自豪的话。他们形容自己这几天的心情，像钢水一样地沸腾。八天前，他们厂里有许多人在党中央所在地的群众接待站幸福地见到了毛主席。有的人和毛主席握了手，全厂职工都把这次会见当作一生中最难忘的时刻，人人感到浑身有使不完的劲。今天他们在天安门前再一次看见毛主席，都跳起来欢呼：“最伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”久久舍不得离开。
    工人队伍里，出现了一个《毛泽东选集》精装本的巨大模型，封面上，毛主席头像金光闪闪。北京化工搪瓷厂的工人昨晚聚在一起，热烈议论该带什么去游行，才能充分表达咱们工人的心意：毛主席像有了，《毛主席语录》人手一册了，语录牌、旗帜、锣鼓也齐了，大伙还觉得不够，一致决定再做一个《毛泽东选集》大模型。学习毛主席著作积极分子、工人胡宝铭带着一些人立即动起手来。你设计，我制作，他油漆，一直忙到深夜十二点。工人们说：战无不胜的毛泽东思想永远是我们一切工作的指导方针，我们只有更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，才能充分发挥智慧和力量，砸烂一个旧世界，建设一个新世界。
