U.S. bandit aircraft brazenly bombed Haiphong City again.

Vietnamese military and civilians bravely fought back, shooting down five enemy planes.

New China News Agency, Hanoi, August 2nd: The U.S. imperialists, disregarding the indignation and condemnation of the Vietnamese people and people of the world, on the 2nd dispatched a large number of aircraft to savagely bomb residential areas and factories within Haiphong, the second largest city in North Vietnam. This is another extremely serious act of war "escalation" since the U.S. bandit aircraft bombed Hanoi and Haiphong on June 29th.

The heroic military and civilians defending Haiphong, turning Chairman Mao Zedong's great call to battle into an invincible force, bravely fought back. According to preliminary reports, they shot down five U.S. planes in one go, once again foiling the arrogant attack by the U.S. air pirates.

In addition, the military and civilians of Hai Duong Province on the 2nd also shot down one invading U.S. plane.

On the 1st, the military and civilians of Hung Yen Province shot down one U.S. plane.

According to supplementary reports, the military and civilians of Ninh Binh Province shot down two U.S. planes on July 8th and 17th, the military and civilians of Vinh Linh District shot down one U.S. plane on July 27th, and the military and civilians of Ha Tinh Province also shot down one U.S. plane on July 28th.
