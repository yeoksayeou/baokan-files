The African people warmly praise Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line. Revolutionary art nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought is the most moving. Chinese handicrafts and revolutionary dances are enthusiastically welcomed in Zanzibar and Zambia.

According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Zanzibar, after a week of exhibition, the Chinese Handicrafts Art Exhibition closed on the evening of July 31. Zanzibar's various circles of people warmly praised the great achievements of Chinese revolutionary handicrafts under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

During the exhibition, about 28,000 people visited the exhibition, a number equal to half of Zanzibar's entire population. Tanzanian First Vice President Karume, accompanied by Chinese Ambassador to Tanzania He Ying, visited the exhibition and wrote in the guest book: "The people of Zanzibar are very happy to see this Chinese handicrafts art exhibition. The exhibition shows the strengthening of friendship between the peoples of Tanzania and China."

Many Zanzibari visitors stood in front of the statue of Chairman Mao at the entrance of the exhibition, expressing their high respect and love for the beloved leader of the Chinese people. They asked the Chinese staff, "How is Chairman Mao's health?" When they learned that Chairman Mao was in good health, they were all very happy. The guest book was filled with praise for Chairman Mao's wise leadership and shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao." A Zanzibari named Nondo wrote: "I am especially happy to see the statue of Chairman Mao. He is the eternal 'star' and 'torch' that illuminates the whole world! He is a great leader. Long live the Chinese revolution." A Zanzibari artist, on his third visit to the exhibition, told the Chinese staff: "I come not only to appreciate the art but also specially to see the statue of Chairman Mao. Because he is the greatest leader of the world's people." Students from Zanzibar's Lumumba Academy wrote: "Mao Zedong is not only the leader of the Chinese people but also an outstanding successor of Marx and Lenin. Long live Mao Zedong Thought."

Some visitors told the Chinese staff that they are currently studying Chairman Mao's works. Many Zanzibari friends also expressed their hope to go to Beijing and see Chairman Mao in person.

The audience warmly praised Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line. They watched with great interest the artistic works depicting the images of steelworkers, commune women, African freedom fighters, and other heroes. A Zanzibari friend said: "Artists should depict the images of workers, peasants, and revolutionary fighters because they are the true masters of the world."

The sculptures "African Female Militia" and "Freedom Fighters Seizing Guns" that depict the fighting spirit of the African people, as well as the embroidered screen with "Equatorial War Drums," particularly moved the people of Zanzibar. Many people wrote: "The sculptures about African freedom fighters are the most attractive and inspiring," "We thank China for supporting the struggle of the African people," "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people are revolutionary people, and they wholeheartedly support the struggle of the oppressed peoples of the world against imperialism and colonialism."

The audience often crowded around the pottery "Vietnamese Female Guerrilla" and the oil painting "Indignation" that depict the brave struggle of the Vietnamese people against American imperialist aggression. One viewer said: "The Vietnamese people are invincible." Another viewer added: "American imperialism is not to be feared," "The Vietnamese people will win, the American aggressors will be defeated."

According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Lusaka, the Chinese folk song and dance troupe recently held seven friendly performances in the famous copper mining area of Zambia, receiving enthusiastic welcome from the broad masses of miners and other audiences.

Zambian audiences watched with great joy the Chinese folk songs and dances full of revolutionary spirit. They particularly liked the performances that sing the praises of great Mao Zedong Thought: the dances "Ode to the Oil Workers," "Female Militia," and the songs "The Ship Sails with the Helmsman," "Mao Zedong Thought Shines Brilliantly." Every time Chairman Mao's portrait appeared on the stage curtain, Zambian miners and other audiences always responded with enthusiastic applause. When the dance "Fighting Africa" was performed, and the stage showed African freedom fighters breaking their chains, picking up weapons, and fighting, the audience was extremely excited. One viewer told the Chinese friends: "Your performance depicts our struggle for freedom and independence." Another viewer said: "Your performance shows the strength of the African and Asian peoples."

Zambian audiences highly praised the Chinese revolutionary art nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought and praised Chairman Mao's policy of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers in literature and art. A Zambian drama artist told the Chinese performers: "Your art is the people's art that reflects the life and struggle of the people." A Zambian artist expressed his hope to learn the correct direction of Chinese literature and art to revive Zambian national art. Many Zambian friends expressed their sincere wishes to Chairman Mao to the Chinese performers.

　　非洲人民热烈赞扬毛主席的文艺路线
　　毛泽东思想哺育的革命艺术最动人
　　我工艺美术和革命歌舞在桑给巴尔和赞比亚受到热情欢迎
    据新华社桑给巴尔电　中国工艺美术展览会在这里展出一个星期后，七月三十一日晚上闭幕。桑给巴尔各界观众热烈赞扬中国革命工艺美术在毛泽东思想指导下取得的巨大成就。
    在展览期间，约有两万八千人参观了这个展览会，参观人数等于桑给巴尔全城居民的一半。坦桑尼亚第一副总统卡鲁姆在中国驻坦桑尼亚大使何英陪同下参观了展览会后，在留言簿上写道：“我们桑给巴尔人民很高兴看到中国的这个工艺美术展览会。这个展览会的展出表明坦桑尼亚和中国两国人民友谊的加强。”
    许多桑给巴尔观众站在展览会入口处的毛主席塑象前，对中国人民敬爱的领袖表示崇高的敬意和热爱。他们相继问中国工作人员：“毛主席身体怎么样？”当知道毛主席身体很健康时，他们都很高兴。留言簿上写满了赞扬毛主席的英明领导和欢呼“毛主席万岁”的话。一个名叫农多的桑给巴尔人写道：“我看到毛主席的塑象特别高兴。他是永远照亮着全世界的“星星”和“火炬”！他是伟大的领袖。中国革命万岁。”一位桑给巴尔艺术家在第三次参观展览会时对中国工作人员说：“我来参观不仅是为了欣赏艺术，而且是特地要看看毛主席的塑象。因为他是世界人民最伟大的领袖。”桑给巴尔卢蒙巴学院的学生写道：“毛泽东不仅是中国人民的领袖，而且是马克思和列宁的杰出的继承者。毛泽东思想万岁。”
    有些观众对中国工作人员说，目前他们正在学习毛主席的著作。不少桑给巴尔朋友还表示希望能去北京，能亲眼看到毛主席。
    观众们热烈赞扬毛主席制定的文艺路线。他们怀着极大的兴趣仔细观看了描绘炼钢工人、公社女社员、非洲自由战士等英雄形象的艺术作品。一位桑给巴尔朋友说：“艺术家应当描绘工人、农民和革命战士的形象，因为他们是世界的真正主人。”
    表现非洲人民的战斗精神的雕刻“非洲女民兵”和“自由战士以矛夺枪”以及绣花屏风上的“赤道战鼓”，特别使桑给巴尔人民激动。许多人写道：“关于非洲自由战士的雕刻最吸引人和鼓舞人心”，“我们感谢中国支持非洲人民的斗争”，“在毛主席领导下的中国人民是革命的人民，他们衷心支持世界被压迫人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义”。
    观众经常拥挤在刻画越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略的英勇斗争的陶象“越南女游击队员”和油画“义愤”前。一位观众说：“越南人民是不可战胜的。”另一位观众补充说：“美帝国主义是不可怕的”，“越南人民必胜，美国侵略者必败”。
    据新华社卢萨卡电　中国民间歌舞团最近在赞比亚共和国著名的铜矿地区举行了七场友好访问演出，受到广大矿工和其他观众的热烈欢迎。
    赞比亚观众怀着极大的喜悦观看充满着革命精神的中国民间歌舞。他们特别喜欢歌颂伟大的毛泽东思想的节目：舞蹈《石油工人凯歌》、《女民兵》和歌曲《大海航行靠舵手》、《毛泽东思想闪金光》等。每当毛主席的肖象在舞台的幕布上出现时，赞比亚的矿工和其他观众总是报以热烈的掌声。当演出舞蹈《战斗的非洲》，舞台上出现非洲自由战士打断镣铐，拿起武器进行战斗时，观众们极为兴奋。有位观众对中国朋友说：“你们的表演描绘了我们争取自由和独立的斗争。”另一位观众说：“你们的表演显示出我们非洲和亚洲人民的力量。”
    赞比亚观众盛赞在毛泽东思想哺育下的中国革命艺术，盛赞毛主席制订的文艺为工农兵服务的方针。一位赞比亚戏剧艺术家对中国演员们说：“你们的艺术是反映人民生活和斗争的人民艺术。”一位赞比亚艺术家表示希望学习中国文艺的正确方向，以复兴赞比亚的民族艺术。许多赞比亚朋友向中国演员表示他们对毛主席的衷心祝愿。
