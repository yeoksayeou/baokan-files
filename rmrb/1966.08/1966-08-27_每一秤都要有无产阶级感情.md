We have read the entire set of anti-party, anti-socialist counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of the counter-revolutionary revisionist Na Sǔfāng, and we feel extremely indignant. Na Sǔfāng opposes our management of enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought and opposes the leadership of politics. He vigorously advocates for profit leadership and currency leadership. It is clear that his goal is to attempt to change the nature of socialist enterprises, turning our socialist enterprises into capitalist enterprises, and causing a capitalist restoration. Therefore, our struggle against Na Sǔfāng is a struggle between socialism and capitalism, a life-and-death class struggle that concerns the future and destiny of our country. We must thoroughly expose and criticize Na Sǔfāng and resolutely defeat him.

In a class society, all economic sectors serve the politics of a certain class. Take commerce, for example. Capitalist commerce serves capitalist politics. The capitalist system determines the nature of capitalist commerce, which is to seek profit. Everything for money, everything for profit, is the fundamental purpose of capitalist commerce. For money, capitalists use large measures to buy and small measures to sell, buy low and sell high, raise prices and suppress prices, shortchange and underweight, adulterate and counterfeit, speculate and hoard, and so on, using every means to squeeze the blood and sweat of the working people. As long as they can achieve the evil goal of making more profit and getting rich, capitalists are capable of any despicable act.

Our socialist commerce serves proletarian politics, serves production, and serves the people's lives. This is fundamentally different from capitalist commerce. Our stores are the people's stores. Each of us commercial workers is a servant of the people. Serving the people wholeheartedly is the sole purpose of running a people's store. Our stores provide convenience for the masses in every way, making the masses feel the concern of the Party and Chairman Mao for their lives, and thus love the Party, love Chairman Mao, and love socialism even more. This further inspires the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses and promotes the development of socialist revolution and construction, which has great political significance. We are not simply doing business, nor are we doing it for more money. We are running commerce for the revolution, doing business for the revolution, and standing at the counter for the revolution. Doing business for money is the hallmark of capitalist commerce, while doing business for the revolution is the hallmark of socialist commerce.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Serve the people wholeheartedly, never leave the masses; act from the interests of the people, not from the interests of individuals or small groups; the unity of being responsible to the people and being responsible to the Party leadership; these are our starting points." We have followed Chairman Mao's teachings and served the people wholeheartedly. Whatever the people need, we will provide it. In our service at the counter, we greet every customer, weigh every scale, and conduct every transaction with the utmost responsibility. Every scale must reflect proletarian sentiment and politics.

In our store, salesperson Jǐn Guìyīng found that a customer had picked a radish with a black spot, so she took it, cut it open, and found that the inside was rotten. She exchanged it for a good one. The customer was moved and said, "You not only check the outside of the radish but also the inside." Another customer wanted to buy a pound of peppercorns, but the salesperson, after understanding the situation, found that half a pound of pepper powder would be enough, so she discussed with the customer and sold him half a pound. The customer said, "Chairman Mao's teachings are good, socialism is good. In the past, buying things was deceiving, but now the store treats us like family."

We do this not to make more money or profit. We are serving the people wholeheartedly. We believe that as long as it is beneficial to the Party and the people, we will do it and do it well. Although this may be a bit troublesome, when we think of our class brothers buying fresh, delicious, clean, and high-quality food from our salespeople, eating well, resting well, studying well, and wholeheartedly contributing to the socialist revolution and construction, we feel especially happy. Serving the people well and providing convenience for the people is the responsibility given to us by the Party. However, Na Sǔfāng advocates that "profit is the most concentrated and sensitive indicator of enterprise management." If we follow Na Sǔfāng's revisionist views, what will our enterprises become? Capitalist business ideas and practices will inevitably spread, corrupting the revolutionary ranks. This will cause us to seriously alienate the masses, turning us into profit-seeking capitalist merchants, distancing us from the Party and the masses, and turning our socialist enterprises into capitalist enterprises, thereby changing the color of our country. It is clear how despicable Na Sǔfāng's plot is and how evil his intentions are!

Na Sǔfāng's profit leadership theory is a poisonous weed, and we must uproot it.

    每一秤都要有无产阶级感情
    沈阳市东方红副食品商店副政治指导员　李素文
    我们看了反党反社会主义分子孙冶方的一整套反革命的修正主义谬论，感到无比愤慨。孙冶方反对我们按照毛泽东思想办企业，反对政治挂帅。他极力鼓吹利润挂帅、钞票挂帅。很明显，他的目的就是妄图改变社会主义企业的性质，把我们社会主义企业变成资本主义企业，使资本主义复辟。所以，我们和孙冶方的斗争，是社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，是关系到我们国家前途和命运的一场你死我活的严重的阶级斗争。我们必须彻底揭露和批判孙冶方，坚决把他打倒。
    在阶级社会里，一切经济部门都是为一定阶级的政治服务的。就拿商业来说，资本主义商业是为资本主义政治服务的。资本主义社会制度决定了资本主义商业唯利是图的性质。一切为了钱，一切为了利润，是资本主义商业的根本目的。为了钱，资本家大斗进，小斗出，低价买，高价卖，抬级压价，缺斤少两，掺杂使假，投机倒把，囤积居奇，等等，千方百计地榨取劳动人民的血汗。只要能够达到多得利润、发财致富的罪恶目的，资本家是什么卑鄙勾当都干得出来的。
    我们社会主义商业是为无产阶级政治服务的，是为生产、为人民生活服务的。这和资本主义商业有本质的区别。我们的商店是人民的商店。我们每个商业工作者都是人民的勤务员。全心全意为人民服务，是我们办人民商店的唯一宗旨。我们商店处处给群众生活送方便，使群众体会到党和毛主席对人民生活的关怀，从而更加热爱党，热爱毛主席，热爱社会主义。这就进一步地鼓舞了人民群众的革命干劲，促进社会主义革命和建设事业的发展。这是有重大政治意义的。我们绝不是单纯做买卖，更不是为了多赚钱。我们是为革命办商业，为革命做生意，为革命站柜台。为赚钱做生意是资本主义商业的标志，为革命做生意是社会主义商业的标志。
    毛主席教导我们：“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众；一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发；向人民负责和向党的领导机关负责的一致性；这些就是我们的出发点。”我们按照毛主席的教导去做了，全心全意为人民服务。群众需要什么，我们就经营什么。我们在柜台服务中，接待每一位顾客，称每一秤，交易每一分钱，都要极端负责任，每一秤都要称出无产阶级感情来，称出政治来。
    我店营业员靳桂英同志在卖萝卜时，发现顾客自己挑的有一个带黑点的萝卜，就主动把它拿来，切开一看里边是坏的，就给掉换一个。顾客感动地说：“你们不仅管萝卜的外面，还管萝卜的里边。”有位顾客要买一斤胡椒粒，营业员问明情况，发现买半斤胡椒面就够了，就和顾客商量卖给他半斤。顾客说：“真是毛主席的教导好，社会主义好，过去买东西受欺骗，今天商店把我们当亲人。”
    我们这样做，是为了多卖钱、多得利润吗？根本不是。我们是全心全意为人民服务。我们认为，只要对党、对人民有利的事，我们就去做，并坚决做好。这样做虽然要麻烦一点，但是，当我们想到我们的阶级弟兄，从我们营业员手里买到新鲜、味美、干净、质量好的副食品，吃得好，休息好，学习好，一心一意地为社会主义革命和建设贡献力量时，心里就感到特别高兴。为群众服好务，给群众送方便，这就是党交给我们的责任。而孙冶方却鼓吹什么“利润是企业经营好坏的最集中的表现”，是“最灵敏的标志”。如果我们按照孙冶方的修正主义观点去做，我们的企业将会变成什么样子呢？资本主义经营思想和经营作风必然泛滥，从而腐蚀了革命队伍。这就会使我们严重地脱离群众，变成唯利是图的资本主义买卖人，就会疏远党和群众的关系，使我们社会主义企业蜕变为资本主义企业，从而使我们国家改变颜色。可见孙冶方的阴谋是多么卑鄙，用心是多么恶毒！
    孙冶方的利润挂帅论是一株大毒草，我们一定要把它连根铲除。
