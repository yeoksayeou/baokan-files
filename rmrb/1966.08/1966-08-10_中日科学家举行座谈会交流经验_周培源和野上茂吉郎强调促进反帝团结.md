Chinese and Japanese scientists held a symposium to exchange experiences after the conclusion of the Beijing Physics Symposium. The two sides expressed a strong desire to promote and strengthen friendship and cooperation between them. They jointly pointed out that this friendship and cooperation must be based on opposing imperialism and old and new colonialism.

Chou Pei-yuan, leader of the Chinese delegation, stressed at the symposium that Chinese and Japanese scientists not only need to learn from each other in academic research but also need to support and cooperate with each other in political struggles. He said that the peoples of China and Japan have the common task of opposing the aggressive policies and war policies of U.S. imperialism. The Chinese people and Chinese scientists deeply sympathize with and firmly support all patriotic proposals and actions of Japanese progressive scientists. The struggle of the Japanese people and Japanese progressive scientists is also a support to the Chinese people.

Yonaga Shigekichiro, leader of the Japanese delegation, said at the symposium that scientists' research and politics are linked together. Japan is under the protection of the United States, and scientists have to participate in political struggles and consider the fundamental question of why they should conduct scientific research. Yonaga highly praised the spirit of Chinese scientists who strive to study the works of Chairman Mao and conduct research work by applying Mao Zedong Thought. He hoped that Japanese scientists and Chinese scientists would strengthen solidarity and understanding through mutual visits and believed that such visits must adhere to the spirit of opposing imperialism, old and new colonialism, and developing national science and culture as proposed by the Beijing Science Symposium.

At the symposium, Chinese and Japanese physicists extensively exchanged views on methodological and epistemological issues in research work, as well as research systems and organizational work, scientific research planning, and related issues of cooperation between scientists of the two countries in the future.

    中日科学家举行座谈会交流经验
    周培源和野上茂吉郎强调促进反帝团结
    新华社七日讯　参加北京物理讨论会的中日两国科学家，在讨论会结束后继续举行了三天相互交流经验的座谈会。两国科学家在座谈会上表达了促进和加强相互间的友谊和合作的强烈愿望，并且共同指出这种友谊和合作必须建立在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的基础之上。
    中国科学家代表团团长周培源在座谈会上强调说，中日两国科学家不但在学术研究方面需要互相学习，在政治斗争方面也要互相支持，互相合作。他说，中日两国人民有着反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策的共同斗争任务，中国人民和中国科学家对日本进步科学家的一切爱国主张和行动深表同情，并坚决支持。日本人民和日本进步科学家的斗争也是对中国人民的支持。
    日本科学家代表团团长野上茂吉郎在座谈会上说，科学家的研究和政治是联系在一起的。日本处在美国的保护伞之下，科学家不得不参加政治斗争，并且考虑到为什么要研究科学这个根本问题。野上高度赞扬中国科学家努力学习毛主席著作，运用毛泽东思想进行研究工作的精神。他希望日本科学家和中国科学家通过相互往来加强团结和了解，并且认为这种往来必须坚持北京科学讨论会提出的反对帝国主义、新老殖民主义和发展民族科学文化的精神。
    座谈会上，中日两国物理学家就研究工作中的方法论和认识论的问题，以及研究体制和组织工作，科学研究的规划和有关两国科学家今后的合作等问题，广泛地交换了意见。
