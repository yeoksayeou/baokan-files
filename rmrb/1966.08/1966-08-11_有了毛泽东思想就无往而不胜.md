The Party Central Committee's decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has struck a chord in our hearts. This decision has given us immense encouragement, provided us with warm criticism, and pointed out our future tasks, as if it were speaking directly about our school. The more we read it, the clearer our minds become, as if Chairman Mao is by our side, guiding us forward.

The decision points out that there will be resistance and setbacks in the struggle. We have a deep understanding of this. The revolutionary road is indeed tortuous and uneven. Over the past few years, we have been oppressed by the black elements in our school. Under the personal leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we are carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. On June 2nd, we formed the "Red Flag" Combat Team and exposed the black elements in our school. Our revolution has initially achieved victory. However, at this moment, the vigorous revolutionary struggle encountered resistance from those who advocate the right-opportunist line. They said we are "anti-Party and anti-socialist," attempting to label us as "counter-revolutionaries." We were not swept away by this backlash. We used Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful weapon, bravely fought back, and firmly stood our ground. Our struggle finally achieved victory under the support of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. However, the struggle is far from over. In recent times, various slanderous rumors have been circulating, accusing us of being a group of "ambitious individualists." These people think they can scare us back. In fact, they have miscalculated. We see clearly that the revolutionary road is tortuous, but the future is bright. No slanderous rumors can make us retreat even half a step. We treat these rumors as negative examples, which make us more aware of the sharpness and complexity of class struggle and only heighten our class vigilance.

We are not afraid of the twists and turns in the struggle. The road of the Chinese revolution has always been tortuous and uneven. The Chinese people have always advanced through storms and waves. The generation of Chinese youth nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought should have the heroic spirit of "The Red Army is not afraid of the long march, ten thousand rivers and mountains are as nothing." We know there are mountains of knives and seas of fire ahead, but we also see the beacon of Mao Zedong Thought shining brightly in the distance. With the radiance of the Mao Zedong Thought beacon guiding us, no stormy waves or mountains of knives and seas of fire can stop us. Sometimes, we may be hit by a wave, but with the armor of Mao Zedong Thought, we will not lose our way. In the struggle, by actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, we can be invincible.

What makes us feel incredibly fortunate is that our beloved leader Chairman Mao has shown us the direction of the revolution. How do we follow this direction? The practice of struggle has repeatedly shown us that we need not only the courage to struggle but also the weapons for struggle. This weapon is the great Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the guide for the revolution and also the guide for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Mao Zedong Thought is the ever-shining sun. When we face difficulties, studying Chairman Mao's works gives us light, doubles our courage, and warms our hearts; when we achieve victory, studying Chairman Mao's works helps us remain humble and cautious, and continue to advance. Without Mao Zedong Thought, we cannot see the direction forward; without Mao Zedong Thought, we dare not struggle against the ghosts and monsters; without Mao Zedong Thought, we dare not advance through storms and waves. It is Mao Zedong Thought that has given us boundless wisdom and strength. As Comrade Lei Feng said, Mao Zedong Thought is "food, weapon, and steering wheel."

We are the critics of the old world and the defenders and builders of the new world. The tasks before us are extremely arduous. In the past ten years of schooling, our school has been filled with bourgeois and revisionist thoughts. Some people claim to be "gardeners," but in reality, they have cut off all the most vigorous revolutionary sprouts; some people smile kindly and appear respectable, but in reality, they are Confucians, thieves, and hooligans. Now, no country in the world has created a new proletarian educational system, and it is our duty to do so. With the warm care and guidance of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we have the confidence and the talent.

The Party Central Committee's decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has illuminated our path forward. We will study and apply it repeatedly in actual struggles. We will not disappoint the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's expectations for us and will always be brave pioneers in this magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

　　有了毛泽东思想就无往而不胜
　　北京大学附中“红旗”战斗小组　彭小蒙
    党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定，一字一句说到了我们的心眼里。这个决定既给了我们巨大的鼓舞，又给了我们亲切的批评，还给我们指出了今后的任务，就象说的是我们学校的事。我们愈读愈感到心明眼亮，就象毛主席在我们身边，给我们指引着前进的方向。
    决定中指出，斗争会有阻力，会有反复。这一点，我们有着很深的体会。革命的道路的确是曲折的，不平坦的。过去几年来，我们一直受到学校里黑帮分子的压迫。党中央和毛主席亲自领导我们搞无产阶级文化大革命。六月二日，我们成立了“红旗”战斗小组，揪出了学校里的黑帮分子。我们的革命，初步取得了胜利。可是，就在这个时候，蓬勃开展的革命斗争，却遭到了一些推行右倾机会主义路线的人的阻力。他们说我们“反党反社会主义”，妄图把我们打成“反革命”。我们没有被这股逆流冲走。我们用毛泽东思想这个强大的武器，勇敢地进行斗争，坚决地顶住了。我们的斗争终于在党中央和毛主席的支持下，又得到了胜利。可是，斗争远远没有结束。最近一个时期以来，又流传着种种中伤我们的流言蜚语，诬蔑我们是一伙“向上爬的个人野心家”等等。这些人以为这样可以把我们吓回去。其实他们是打错了算盘。我们看得很清楚，革命的道路是曲折的，前途是光明的。任何流言蜚语都不能使我们后退半步。我们将这些流言蜚语当作是一种反面教材，它使我们更加认识到阶级斗争的尖锐性、复杂性，它只能提高我们的阶级警惕。
    我们不怕斗争的反复，不怕革命道路的曲折。中国革命的道路从来就是曲折的、不平坦的。中国人民从来就是在大风大浪中前进的。毛泽东思想哺育出来的中国青年一代，应该有“红军不怕远征难，万水千山只等闲”的英雄气概。我们知道前面有刀山，有火海，可是，我们还看到前面有光芒万丈的毛泽东思想的灯塔。有毛泽东思想灯塔的光辉照耀，任何惊涛骇浪，任何刀山火海都挡不住我们。有时候，我们可能受到一个浪头的冲击。但是，我们有毛泽东思想的武装，就不会晕头转向。在斗争中坚持活学活用毛主席著作，我们就能无往而不胜。
    使我们感到无比幸福的是，我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席给我们指明了革命的方向。怎样循着这个方向前进？斗争实践一再表明，我们不仅要有斗争的勇气，还要有斗争的武器。这个武器，就是伟大的毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想是革命的指南，也是无产阶级文化大革命的指南。毛泽东思想是不落的太阳。当困难的时候，我们学习了毛主席著作，就看到了光明，勇气倍长，心里暖洋洋的；当胜利的时候，我们学习了毛主席著作，就能够戒骄戒躁，谦虚谨慎，不断前进。没有毛泽东思想，我们看不清前进的方向；没有毛泽东思想，我们就不敢同牛鬼蛇神斗争；没有毛泽东思想，我们就不敢在大风大浪中前进。是毛泽东思想给了我们无穷的智慧和力量。正象雷锋同志说的，毛泽东思想是“粮食、武器、方向盘”。
    我们是旧世界的批判者，新世界的保卫者和建设者。摆在我们面前的任务是十分艰巨的。过去我念了十年书，学校里资产阶级、修正主义思想满天飞。有些人自称是“园丁”，其实他们把我们最生气勃勃的革命新芽都剪掉了；有些人笑容可掬、道貌岸然，其实他们就是孔夫子、小偷、流氓……。现在，世界上任何一个国家还没有创造出一套新的无产阶级的教育制度，我们应该以此为己任。有党中央和毛主席的亲切关怀和教导，我们有这个信心，有这个天才。
    党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定照亮了我们前进的道路，我们要在实际斗争中反复学习、反复运用。我们一定不辜负党中央和毛主席对我们的殷切期望，在这场轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命中，永远做一个勇敢的闯将！
