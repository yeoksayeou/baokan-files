The U.S. imperialists have been bombing and strafing North Vietnam, with one of their most vicious targets being the roads on Vietnamese soil, attempting to cut off and destroy transportation. The heroic Vietnamese people have smashed this plot with their iron fists. They say, "The transportation lines are the lifeblood of the motherland. Keeping the transportation lines open is to ensure the road to victory."

The transportation lines in North Vietnam are lines of fierce battle. On this front, you can see the Vietnamese people fighting with a spirit of decisive battle and victory against the American air pirates. On this front, you can feel the vibrant journey.

If it is night, you can especially feel this. Vehicles loaded with green leaves and branches are speeding along, shouting joyfully. Transportation bicycles and single-person bicycles are also setting off. Pedestrians take advantage of the cool night to travel. The fighting people treat the night as the most active time. Along the main roads, not far apart, there are lights from air raid posts, reporting safety to the vehicles and pedestrians on the road, and everyone happily speeds up. If the color of the lights changes, it means the enemy planes have come, and everyone is preparing. Perhaps the enemy planes will hang a string of flares above, filling the road with a solemn atmosphere of battle. Sometimes, after the enemy planes have just bombed ahead, the repaired road immediately has a flow of vehicles and people continuing forward.

We have walked on such roads for many nights. There are many vivid scenes on the battle lines of transportation. However, the most unforgettable impression is the scene when the road is just repaired. Those who defend the transportation lines are laughing and shouting as they move forward, making a gesture forward. This gesture points, and the vehicles and pedestrians rush forward. This gesture contains the pride of declaring another victory.

Rivers are numerous on Vietnamese soil, and so are bridges. Sometimes, in a journey of no more than one or two hours, there can be ten or even dozens of bridges. Bridges are the joints connecting the transportation lines, so the American aggressors madly bombed large and small bridges again and again.

However, the enemy's attempt to cut off the transportation lines by bombing bridges failed. Tens of thousands of hands are defending large and small bridges, and tens of thousands of hands are building bridges. Around some large bridges, dozens of enemy planes have been shot down, but the bridges still stand, and transportation remains smooth. Some bridges are just damaged, and new floating bridges are already in operation on the same river. There is also a wide river that has never had a bridge before. French aggressors failed to build a bridge here for many years. Now, there is a long floating bridge designed and built by the transportation warriors themselves.

Each bridge is a battlefield where heroic sons and daughters are fighting. In River Quiang Province, I met an 18-year-old sapper, Zhang Guangzhen, who is a hero fighting by the bridge. One day, during an enemy air raid in this area, he and another comrade, under the danger of nearby bombs and rocket shells exploding, camouflaged a bridge as a green shrub. Another time, he and his comrades had to retrieve a batch of iron beams from the old bridge to build a new one. The task of building the bridge was urgent, but retrieving the iron beams was not easy. At night, some dove into the water to move them, and some pulled from above. After working hard all night, dawn broke, and there was still a stubborn iron beam stuck in the riverbed. Continuing to retrieve it would risk being bombed by enemy planes. These young people discussed and decided to continue for the sake of building the new bridge. Zhang Guangzhen dove into the water, tied the iron beam, and let his comrades pull. Just as they were pulling halfway, sure enough, two enemy planes flew in from the sea. The comrades wanted to put down the iron beam to hide, but they found that the iron beam could not be placed on the slope. This iron beam weighing several hundred kilograms rushed towards Zhang Guangzhen, who was still in the water. He quickly jumped up, trying to ride on the iron beam to avoid being hit. However, the iron beam came too fast. Although it was slowed down by weeds, it still pressed Zhang Guangzhen's leg and pushed him into the river. Zhang Guangzhen had just managed to ride on it, but was pushed down and fainted in the water, floating downstream with the current. When his comrades caught up and pulled him ashore from several hundred meters away, he woke up and said his first words: "Hurry up and bring that big iron beam up to build the new bridge."

Bridges are like this, and ferry crossings are also like this. On the wide rivers without bridges, it is the ferry boats that undertake the task of transporting vehicles and pedestrians across the river. In some places, when the bridge is damaged, the ferry boats connect the transportation lines. In many places, there are both bridges and ferries. The ferry crossing requires waiting and turning time, and here, the transportation warriors and enemy planes often engage in more intense or more frequent battles. The river water cannot be bombed out, and the ferry boats, the connection between the two banks, are something that American pirate planes can never bomb apart.

In Nghe An, there is a small ferry crossing. The people here, to ensure the smooth flow of transportation, have rushed across the river many times in battles with enemy planes. They put forward the slogan: "Transportation warriors are good at opening the way, firepower is cover, and the vehicle team is the assault force." This means that the ferry crossing is a battlefield where various transportation personnel cooperate, act flexibly, and fight. Several times, at night, enemy planes dropped flares at the ferry crossing, chasing and bombing the boats and vehicles, but the ferry warriors used various methods to cross. Another time, it was midday. To support a battle, they resolutely built a floating bridge to let the artillery cross the river. Six enemy planes took turns diving and firing rockets, but the artillery also immediately counterattacked. The result of the confrontation was that the artillery safely crossed the river in broad daylight and rushed to new positions.

At another ferry crossing, the person in charge, Jian, told me with an optimistic smile about their battles at the ferry crossing. Once, enemy planes blew up their temporary floating bridge planks they were setting up, but they immediately swam to rescue the planks and set up new ones. Jian often took the lead in dangerous work. During this period, at the ferry crossing, he had been buried by the dirt blown up by bombs several times.

Long roads are even wider battlefields.

Transportation warriors, assault team members, militiamen, as well as the elderly and youth, they swing their shovels and picks, making the land and stone slopes obey their will, turning into long roads to the front. They are the builders of the roads and also the defenders of the roads.

For a period, enemy planes bombed a section of the road five times in one day. That day, on this road surface, some places were destroyed for dozens of meters, and the bomb craters were several meters deep. What to do? They worked and fought in different directions. Some continued to shoot at the sky, some, despite the bombing and strafing, checked the road surface and cleared the timed bombs. Zhang Xiong and a few comrades were checking and clearing the road. Some bombs were easy to push, just pushed into the river beside the road and exploded, and the road was safe. Some were not easy to push, so they dismantled them on the spot. That night, a crowd of people came to fill the road. They dug soil from the nearby hillside, filled the large pits, and filled half of it before letting the vehicles pass. To speed up transportation, they were not afraid of hard work or danger. When the vehicles drove over the newly filled half of the road, the road-fillers stood in a row at the edge of the pit to direct and protect the vehicles passing by the pit. After the vehicles passed, they continued to repair. They thought that the road was more important than rest, and the vehicles rushing forward were more important than themselves.

Another afternoon, enemy planes dropped many bombs on a section of the road, including some timed bombs. Another group of transportation warriors went to clear the bombs. Most of them were male comrades, but there was also a female comrade named Lun Gu. Everyone worked together, some pushed, some dismantled, and all the timed bombs were removed. However, there was a large timed bomb, one end by the roadside, the other end leaning against a stone road surface above a culvert. If it exploded, it would damage the road surface and the culvert, requiring a lot of effort to repair. To move it, they did not know when it would explode. They were discussing when Lun Gu came up with a new idea: the section of the road where the bomb was leaning happened to have one side against the mountain, and the road surface was currently very narrow. Why not use the timed bomb to blast the mountain, and the road surface could be widened. Everyone discussed and agreed that this idea was good. She and her comrades thought of digging a hole in the cliff to let the bomb head face the cliff and shove it in. Thus, they fearlessly did it this way, and it was indeed successful. Thirty minutes later, the bomb exploded, blasting a large amount of soil and rocks from the cliff, which was used to widen the road surface. The bomb tail was facing the road, causing minimal damage to the road. They protected the road and also used the bomb to serve transportation. The people on the transportation lines of that province mentioned this incident and said with a smile that it was well handled.

On this battlefield, the transportation lines are thus open, thus reaching the distant places, thus with people and vehicles coming and going.

In our journey, we have encountered many Vietnamese comrades in charge of transportation calling out on the road, many times heard the singing of female militiamen under the rows of hats by the roadside, and many times had joyful conversations with sappers and militiamen. It is these people who have a resolute saying among them: "The enemy bombs, we repair, we walk; the enemy bombs again, we repair again, we walk again." Yes, they are so tenacious in defending the road with their hands!

I have seen this scene many times myself. Yes, the important thing is that there are "many hands working" on the road. The deepest source of the great power of war lies among the thousands and millions of people. For the transportation lines of the anti-aggression war, they are open in their hands. The road stretching to the distant places is also the road to victory, held in the hands of the Vietnamese people who resolutely resist the Americans and save the country. The mad bombing and sabotage by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys can only add some records of overcoming difficulties on this road. The final victory will surely belong to the Vietnamese people.

    保卫通向胜利的道路
    有声有色的行程
    美帝国主义对越南北方进行轰炸扫射，最恶毒的一个目标就是截断、毁坏越南土地上的道路，妄想扼杀交通运输。英雄的越南人民以坚决的铁拳粉碎了美帝国主义的阴谋。他们说，交通运输线，这是祖国的血脉，让交通运输线畅通，就是让道路通向胜利。
    越南北方的交通运输线，是充满着激烈战斗的战线。在这条战线上，你可以看见越南人民以决战决胜精神同美国空中强盗较量的丰采。在这条战线上，你可以感受到处在有声有色的行程之中。
    要是夜晚，那更可以体会到这一点。一辆辆插满绿叶青枝的汽车，欢叫快跑。运输自行车和单人骑的自行车，也出发了。行人趁着夜里便于防空和凉爽，正好赶路。战斗着的人民把黑夜当作最活跃的时候。沿着大路，隔不远就有防空哨的灯光，向路上的车辆行人报告着平安，大家高高兴兴加快行程。如果灯光颜色变了，那就知道敌机来了，大家就作着准备。也许，敌机会在头顶上空挂起一串串照明弹，路上就充满庄严的战斗气氛。有时敌机在前面刚炸过，马上修好的路上，车流人流，继续向前。
    我们已经在这样的路上走过许多个夜晚了。关于战斗的交通线上有声有色的情景，那是很多的。可是应该说，最难忘的印象是路刚刚修整好时的情景，那些保卫交通线的人们，欢笑呼叫着往前进的时候，还作个伸向前去的手势。这手势一指，车辆行人就向前奔去。这个手势里含着宣告又一次胜利的自豪。
    靠他们，要过桥，能过桥
    越南土地上河流多，桥也多。有时在不过一二小时的行程里，竟会有十来座甚至数十座桥。桥是连接交通线的关节，因此，美国侵略者疯狂地对着大大小小的桥梁炸了又炸。
    但是，敌人想从炸桥来掐断交通线的妄想落空了。成千成万双手在保卫着大大小小的桥梁，成千成万双手又在架起桥梁。桥边就是打敌机的火网，桥边也就是“桥梁工厂”。有的大桥，已经使得数十架敌机葬身桥畔，而桥仍然屹立，交通仍然畅通。有的桥刚坏了，同一条河上又有新浮桥通车了。还有一条宽阔的河面，从来没有桥，以前法国侵略者多少年也没有在这里修起桥来。现在河上已经有了交通战士自己设计修造起来的长浮桥。
    每一座桥周围都是英雄儿女进行激战的战场，在河静省，我遇见了一位十八岁的工兵张光真，就是在桥边战斗的一个英雄。有一个白天，在敌机侵袭这一带的时候，他和另一个同志冒着近处的炸弹、火箭炮弹的爆炸危险，把一座桥伪装成绿色的小树丛。另一次，他和同志们为了架新桥，要从旧桥处捞取一批铁梁。架桥任务紧急，但捞取铁梁很不容易。在黑夜，有的钻进水底搬弄，有的在上边拉。苦干了一夜，天已破晓，还有最后一根顽固的铁梁插在河底。继续捞，就要冒敌机来炸的危险。这些年轻人一讨论，为了架新桥，又动手干起来。张光真扎下水去，把铁梁拴上，让同志们拉。大家正拉个半截，果然两架敌机从海上向这里疾飞而来。同志们一看想先放下铁梁隐蔽一下，那知道铁梁在斜坡上放不住，这根几百公斤的铁梁对着还站在河水里的张光真直冲下去。他急中生智，连忙跳起来，想骑上铁梁，以免直撞到身上。但是，铁梁来的太猛了，虽然被杂草堵了一下减低了速度，但是仍然挤住张光真的腿，狠狠压向河里。张光真本来骑上去了，被这一推，昏倒在水里，随着水流旋卷向下游漂去。等到同志们赶上去，从几百米外把他救上岸后，他醒过来，首先说的话，就是赶快把那根大铁梁弄上来去架新桥。
    靠他们，要过渡，能过渡
    桥是这样，渡口也是这样。在那无桥的宽阔的江河面上，就是渡船在担当载运车辆和行人过河的任务。有的地方桥坏了，就由渡船衔接交通线，许多地方本来就是桥、渡两样都有的。渡口要有待渡、过渡的周转时间，在这里交通战士和敌机进行的较量，常常更为激烈或者说更为经常。江河水是炸不完的，渡船这个连接两岸的纽结，是美国强盗飞机永远也炸不断的。
    在义安有个不大的渡口。这个渡口的人们，为了保证交通运输线畅通，多少次在同敌机战斗中抢渡。他们提出口号：“交通战士是好开关，火力是掩护，车队是突击手”。这就是说，渡口是各种交通人员互相配合、机动灵活作战的战场。有几次，在夜晚，敌机在渡口打起照明弹，追着船只和车辆炸，但是被渡口的战士用各种办法渡过去了。另一次，是午间，为了支援一处的战斗，他们坚决搭起浮桥，让炮兵过河。六架敌机轮番俯冲并发射火箭炮，但是渡河的炮兵也立即回击。较量的结果是炮兵在大白天也安全地过了河，奔向新的阵地。
    在另一个渡口上，渡口负责人俭同志带着乐观的微笑向我说了他们在渡口上战斗的故事。敌机有次炸散了他们正在搭起的临时浮桥板，他们马上游水抢救木板，又搭起新的来。俭同志自己常常抢在艰险工作的前面。这一段时间里，在渡口上，他已被炸弹翻起的泥土埋过好几次了。
    靠他们，要走路，能走通
    长长的路上，是更宽阔的战场。
    交通战士们、突击队员们、民兵们，还有老人、少年，他们挥动锨镐，让土地、石坡听从意志，变成通向前方的长路。他们是路的修筑者，又是路的保卫者。
    有一段时间，敌机连炸一段路，在一天之内成群敌机连炸五次。那天，在这段路面上，有的地方毁坏了几十米，弹坑也深达几米。怎么办？他们分头工作、战斗。有的继续对空射击，有的不顾轰炸扫射检查路面，清除定时炸弹。张雄等几个同志就是边查边清路的。有的炸弹好推，刚推下路旁河里就炸了，路却安全。有的不好推，他们就地拆除。当晚，这段路面上来了填路的人群。他们挖取旁边山坡上的土，填平大坑，填了多半边就让车辆通过了。为了加快运输，他们不怕劳累，不怕艰险，在车辆驶过新填的半边路面的时候，填路的人们还自己在坑沿排成一行，去指挥、卫护车辆通过坑旁。车子过去，他们又继续修。他们认为路比休息重要，奔向前方的车辆比自己重要。
    另一天下午，敌机在一段路上投下许多炸弹，其中还有一些定时炸弹，又有一组交通战士去清理炸弹。其中绝大部分是男同志，也有个女同志叫轮姑。大家一齐动手，有的推，有的拆，定时炸弹都搞掉了。但是有一颗大定时炸弹，一头在路边，一头斜靠近一处过水涵洞上面的石头路面上。要是炸了，损坏了路面和涵洞，得花大工夫修。要搬运，又不知道什么时候炸。他们正在商量着，轮姑提出新建议来：炸弹靠的这段路正好一面背山，路面目前很窄，干脆利用定时炸弹来炸山，路面反倒可以加宽。大家一讨论，认为这意见好，她和同志们想出了在山崖挖个坑洞，让弹头朝山崖塞进去。于是，他们不怕危险，就这样干了，也果然成功了。三十分钟后，炸弹响过，从山崖上打下一大批土石，用来垫宽路面，炸弹尾巴朝路，对路损害微小。他们保护了路，还利用炸弹为交通服务。那个省的交通线上的人们提起这件事来，就笑着说处理得好。
    敌人炸，我们修，我们走
    在这战斗的土地上，交通运输线的道路就这样在畅通，就这样通向远方，就这样人来车往。
    在我们的行程中，多少次碰见办交通的越南同志在路上招唤，多少次听见路旁那些成排成排的斗笠下面响起了女民兵们的歌声，多少次与工兵和民兵们欢谈。就是这些人，他们中间流传着一句斩钉截铁的话：“敌人炸，我们修，我们走；敌人再炸，我们再修，我们再走。”是啊，他们就是这样顽强地用手来保卫路的啊！
    这场面我自己也不止一次看到，是啊，重要的是在道路上有如他们说的“多少双手在干”。战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于千百万人民之中，为了反侵略战争的交通运输线，在他们手中得以畅通。伸向远方的道路，也是通向胜利的道路，掌握在坚决抗美救国的越南人民手中。美帝国主义的狂轰滥炸，美帝国主义及其走狗的破坏，只能使这路上增添一些克服困难的纪录。最后的胜利必定属于越南人民。
