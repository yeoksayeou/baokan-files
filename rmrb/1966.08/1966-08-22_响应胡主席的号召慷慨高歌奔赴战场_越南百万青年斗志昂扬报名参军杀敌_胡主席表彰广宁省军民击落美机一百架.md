In the face of the U.S. aggressors' "escalation" of the war, the youth of North Vietnam are boiling with enthusiasm and high morale, enthusiastically responding to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call to arms and the country's partial mobilization order. In just one month, nearly a million people have volunteered to enlist and fight the enemy.

The heroic oath, "Firmly respond to Chairman Hu's call, fear no hardship or sacrifice, fight bravely, and carry on the struggle to resist the Americans and save the nation to the end," has become the actual action of the broad masses of Vietnamese youth. The capital, Hanoi, has already seen 200,000 youths enlist, and launched a campaign of "Listening to Uncle Hu's words, remembering the hatred for the American aggressors, fully displaying heroic spirit, carrying forward the 'three preparations' spirit, and determined to defeat the American aggressors." The city of Haiphong has seen 130,000 youths enlist to fight the enemy and save the nation. Various provinces and regions have also seen tens of thousands of youths enlist. Some have already donned military uniforms and rushed to the front lines, while others are awaiting orders to join the army, ready to fight in any place the motherland needs them. Reserve officers and soldiers across the country have also rushed to apply to return to their units.

Among the youths volunteering to enlist across the country, there are large numbers of young women. Hanoi and Haiphong each have tens of thousands of young women volunteering to enlist. The first batch of young women volunteers from Son An County, Quang Ninh Province, recently donned their military uniforms with joy and pride and entered the army.

Many local party and government organizations and the masses have held farewell ceremonies for the youths enlisting. Mothers send their sons, wives send their husbands, and with high spirits, they sing and march to the battlefield. At a farewell ceremony in Quang Ninh Province, the mother of a female volunteer, Kim Vinh, said excitedly, "My daughter was born not long ago, and her father was martyred in the war against the French. Today, the American aggressors have come to invade our country and disrupt our peaceful lives. I have no sons, so I give my daughter to the country, to Uncle Hu, to let her contribute to the struggle to resist the Americans and save the nation!"

New China News Agency, Hanoi, August 20th—On the 19th, Chairman Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam wrote a letter to the military and people of Quang Ninh Province, representing the Central Committee of the Labor Party and the government to commend them for their glorious achievement of shooting down 100 U.S. aggressor planes by August 15th this year.

On August 5, 1964, the military and people of Quang Ninh Province, in the battle to counter the first U.S. air raid on North Vietnam, shot down three U.S. planes in one go.

In his letter, Chairman Hu encouraged the military and people of Quang Ninh Province to continue to carry forward the heroic tradition, to unite closely, to constantly heighten vigilance, to smash all the evil plots of the U.S. aggressors, and to create more and greater achievements in the battle and in production.
