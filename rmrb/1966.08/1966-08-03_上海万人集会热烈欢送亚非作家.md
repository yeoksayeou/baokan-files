Shanghai's Million-Person Rally Sends Off Asian and African Writers

Guo Moruo, Zhang Chengzong, and Senanayake, along with other Asian and African writers, speak highly of the achievements of the Asian and African Writers' Emergency Conference. Asian and African writers passionately sing the praises of the great Chairman Mao and the universal illumination of Mao Zedong Thought.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 2nd: Tonight, over ten thousand people from various sectors of Shanghai gathered at the Cultural Square to hold a grand rally, warmly sending off friends from various countries and regions who attended the Asian and African Writers' Emergency Conference as they return to their battle stations. The rally warmly celebrated the great victory of the united struggle against imperialism and neo-colonialism by the Asian and African peoples. The meeting fully expressed the firm will and unshakable confidence of the Chinese people and the Asian and African peoples to carry the struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism through to the end.

At the meeting, Asian and African writers delivered passionate speeches, highly praising the great achievements of the Asian and African Writers' Emergency Conference. They severely condemned U.S. imperialism and old and new colonialism. Many people also emphasized that the Soviet revisionists, in collusion with U.S. imperialism, are attempting to reverse the wheel of history, but their doom is sealed. The revolutionary people of the world are sweeping away this small clique of demons with thunderous force.

Friends from Asia and Africa who spoke at the meeting, through their personal experiences or what they had witnessed during their visits and tours in China, passionately praised the great Chairman Mao and the universal illumination of Mao Zedong Thought. They said: "Chairman Mao Zedong is the leader and teacher of all revolutionaries in the world, an unparalleled hero and guide," "Chairman Mao Zedong leads the oppressed peoples along the great path indicated by Lenin to victory," "Mao Zedong Thought is the guarantee of the people's victory in struggle, the compass for the world's proletariat in revolutionary struggle," "The invincible Mao Zedong Thought has the power to see through everything!"

Tonight, the Cultural Square was ablaze with lights and banners. The songs "The Boat Needs a Helm" and "The Internationale" resonated throughout the venue.

When Guo Moruo, Chairman of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles and head of the Chinese delegation to the Asian and African Writers' Emergency Conference, Zhang Chengzong, Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, and Shanghai Vice Mayors Liang Guobin, Zhang Chengzong, and Jin Zhonghua accompanied Secretary-General Senanayake and other Asian and African friends onto the stage, the entire venue erupted in music and applause. People waved flowers, ribbons, and shook gongs and drums to bid farewell to the Asian and African friends returning to their battle stations. The Asian and African friends also warmly waved back. A group of Young Pioneers ran onto the stage to present flowers to the Asian and African writers. At this moment, the seats opposite the stage, occupied by over three thousand female students, waved red flowers forming the words "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought!" The entire venue erupted in thunderous applause, expressing the boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao.

Shanghai Vice Mayor Zhang Chengzong presided over the meeting and delivered the opening speech. He, on behalf of the ten million people of Shanghai, once again expressed their sincere and militant friendship to the Asian and African writer friends and congratulated the great victory achieved by the conference!

Guo Moruo then delivered a lengthy speech (full text on page 3).

Secretary-General Senanayake followed with a passionate speech (full text on page 3).

Chen Wenxian, a representative from the Vietnamese Democratic Republic's embassy in China, severely condemned the aggressive crimes of the U.S. and recounted the victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation. He said that regardless of whether the U.S. imperialists use military force or "peace talks" conspiracies, the result will only be their heavy defeat. The Vietnamese people will never surrender. He said that what makes the Vietnamese people proud is that in their struggle, they have always had the seven hundred million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, as a powerful backing and a vast land as a strong rear. With their own inherent traditions and experiences of struggle, and the thorough sympathy and support of their brothers, the Vietnamese people believe that their struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation will surely be victorious, and U.S. imperialism will surely be defeated.

After recounting the heinous crimes committed by U.S. imperialism in Vietnam, Nguyen Thuong, a representative of the Permanent Delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to China, firmly stated that the people of South Vietnam have no other path but to rise up and fight for independence and freedom. He pointed out that the U.S. imperialists' "peace talks" deception cannot fool anyone. The Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation is developing with unprecedented momentum and will surely deal a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism.

He said that the seven hundred million Chinese people and the people of Shanghai are firmly holding their guns, ready to make any sacrifice and endure any hardship to support the Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. imperialism until complete victory is achieved. The people of South Vietnam regard this as a solid backing and great support.

Sudanese representative Kair said that the more progress we make in our revolutionary struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys with the people of various countries, the more we adhere to our revolutionary principles, and the more clearly we see that the Soviet revisionist leaders and their followers in Sudan or elsewhere are merely a pitiful mercenary group serving U.S. imperialism. He said that Mao Zedong Thought is the vivid embodiment and brilliant summary of the unprecedented arduous revolutionary struggle of over seven hundred million people over several decades. Therefore, Mao Zedong Thought is the most precious gift that the Chinese people have given to the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world. Every day in the people's struggle provides new proof that Mao Zedong Thought is correct, invincible, and has the power to see through everything.

Pakistani delegation head Shaukat Siddiqui said that the Pakistani people will never forget that at the most critical moment in our country's history, when India invaded Pakistan with all its military might, the Chinese people and their government gave us sincere support. In his speech, he praised the great achievements of the Chinese people, which are unparalleled in human history.

Congolese (Leopoldville) delegation head Kibwe Constantine said that the success of the Asian and African Writers' Emergency Conference is a great victory for the peoples of the two continents, a great challenge to U.S. imperialism and its accomplices, and a great support to the Vietnamese people in their anti-aggression struggle. He said that when we return to Africa, we will recall how the Chinese people, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and the general line of the Communist Party, have launched a great leap forward in all aspects with great enthusiasm and self-reliance. This shows us what people can do when they can work freely with their own strength.

All of this is thanks to the creative genius of their leader Mao Zedong and the correct leadership of the Communist Party. The thoughts of Comrade Mao Zedong are the guarantee of victory for the struggling people and the property of the world, the compass for the world's proletariat to achieve victory in a just war.

Philippine delegation head Amado Hernandez, in his speech, condemned the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism in Vietnam and the treacherous activities of Soviet revisionism in colluding with U.S. imperialism to betray the Vietnamese people. He said that China is the vanguard of the oppressed fighting against the oppressors. The newly emerging countries of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, long suffering from slavery and exploitation, will unite around New China, the great and noble vanguard of the world revolution and her incomparable leader and guide, who is also the unparalleled hero and guide of all revolutionaries in the world—our beloved Chairman Mao Zedong!

Tanzanian delegation head Yahya Muhammad Hassan in his speech severely condemned the sabotage and split activities of the Soviet revisionists against the Asian and African writers' movement. He said that we must be vigilant and strengthen our struggle. The Asian and African writers' movement is a revolutionary movement. This movement is fighting a battle against imperialism and its lackeys and reactionaries. He said that Mao Zedong Thought is not only the guiding light for the Chinese people to achieve victory but also the guiding light for the people of all countries to achieve victory. Mao Zedong Thought not only illuminates the Chinese workers, peasants, and soldiers but also far exceeds the borders of China, illuminating the broad masses of laboring people in the world. Anyone, whether in China or elsewhere, who is armed with Mao Zedong Thought will surely achieve victory.

Indonesian representative Agam Wispri in his speech talked about his impressions from his visits to various places in our country. He said that the visits left a deep impression, that is, China is currently carrying out a widespread and in-depth movement to study the works of Chairman Mao. We also saw that China is carrying out a magnificent proletarian cultural revolution, which is an unprecedented great event in world cultural history. He said that currently, the Nasution-Suharto military fascist clique, in destroying and defiling the friendly relations between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples, has committed more barbaric acts than Hitler's Nazis. These puppets of the U.S. imperialists have exposed their reactionary nature in front of the Indonesian and world peoples. The awakening Indonesian people will soon throw these puppets from their thrones into the garbage heap.

The speeches by Guo Moruo, Zhang Chengzong, and foreign friends were repeatedly interrupted by thunderous applause. Some foreign friends, after finishing their speeches, shouted anti-imperialist revolutionary slogans with the entire audience.

As the meeting concluded, the entire venue stood up, and the shouts, cheers, and applause resonated like thunder, echoing for a long time.

Vice heads of the Chinese delegation to the Asian and African Writers' Emergency Conference, Xu Guangping, Ba Jin, and Liu Baiyu, as well as some members of the delegation, attended tonight's farewell rally. Also in attendance were relevant leaders and writers from Shanghai.

After the meeting, foreign friends watched the large-scale musical "Flames in the Palm Grove."

    上海万人集会热烈欢送亚非作家

    亚非作家热情歌颂伟大的毛主席、歌颂毛泽东思想光芒普照世界
    据新华社上海二日电今天晚上，上海各界一万多人在文化广场隆重集会，热烈欢送出席亚非作家紧急会议的各个国家和地区的朋友重返战斗岗位，热烈欢呼亚非人民团结反帝事业的伟大胜利。大会充分表达了中国人民和亚非人民一定要把反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义斗争进行到底的坚强意志和必胜信心。
    亚非作家们在会上发表了热情洋溢的讲话，高度评价亚非作家紧急会议的巨大成就。严厉谴责美帝国主义和新老殖民主义。许多人还强调指出，苏联修正主义者和美帝国主义一唱一和，妄图倒转历史前进的车轮，它们灭亡的命运是注定了的，世界革命人民正在以雷霆万钧之势，横扫这一小撮牛鬼蛇神。
    大会上发言的亚非朋友，以自己的亲身经历或者在中国访问参观中亲眼目睹的事实，热情歌颂伟大的毛主席、歌颂光芒普照世界的毛泽东思想。他们说：“毛泽东主席是世界上所有革命者的领袖和导师，是无可伦比的英雄和指路人”，“毛泽东主席引导着被压迫人民，沿着伟大的列宁所指出的道路走向胜利”，“毛泽东思想是斗争中的人民取得胜利的保证，是世界无产阶级进行革命斗争的指南针”，“战无不胜的毛泽东思想，具有洞悉一切的威力！”
    今晚，文化广场灯火灿烂，红旗招展。《大海航行靠舵手》、《全世界人民团结起来》的歌声激荡全场。
    当全国文联主席、出席亚非作家紧急会议的中国代表团团长郭沫若，中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志，上海市副市长梁国斌、张承宗、金仲华等陪同森纳那亚克秘书长和其他亚非朋友们登上主席台时，全场鼓乐齐鸣，人们挥舞花束、彩带、摇着铃鼓，向即将回到战斗岗位的亚非朋友致意，亚非朋友也热烈向大家挥手致意。一群少先队员跑上主席台向亚非作家献花，这时主席台对面的座位上三千多名女学生随着乐曲翻出由红色花朵组成的
  “毛泽东思想万岁！”全场再次响起风雷激荡的掌声，表达了人们对伟大领袖毛主席的无限敬爱。
    上海市副市长张承宗主持会议，并致开会词，他代表一千万上海人民，再一次表达对亚非作家朋友们的最真挚的、战斗的友情，对大会所取得的伟大胜利，表示热烈的祝贺！
    接着，郭沫若发表长篇讲话（全文见第三版）。
    森纳那亚克秘书长接着发表了热情的讲话（全文见第三版）。
    越南民主共和国驻中国大使馆专员陈文献严厉谴责了美帝的侵略罪行，叙述了越南人民抗美救国斗争中所取得的胜利。他说，不管美帝国主义采取武力手段，还是“和谈”阴谋，结果都只能使它遭到惨重的失败。越南人民是绝对不会屈服的。他说，越南人民感到非常自豪的是，他们在战斗中一向有毛泽东思想武装起来的兄弟般的七亿中国人民作为强大的后盾，有中国广阔的土地作为坚强的后方。凭着自己固有的斗争传统和经验，又有兄弟般的彻底的同情和支持，越南人民相信，他们的抗美救国斗争必将取得胜利，美帝国主义必将失败。
    越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团代表阮顺和历述了美帝国主义在越南犯下的滔天罪行以后，坚定地说，越南南方人民除去起来用斗争取得独立和自由而外，没有任何其他道路。他指出，美帝国主义的“和平谈判”的欺骗手段骗不了任何人，越南人民的抗美救国斗争正以前所未有的威力蓬勃发展，越南一定会给予美帝国主义以沉重的打击。
    他说，兄弟的七亿中国人民和上海人民，正在紧握手中枪，随时准备承担一切牺牲和艰苦，支持越南人民反对美帝国主义，直到取得完全胜利。越南南方人民把这看作是牢固的靠山、伟大的支持。
    苏丹代表凯尔说，我们同各国人民在反对美帝国主义及其走狗的革命斗争中取得进展越大，我们就越坚持我们的革命原则，我们也越清楚地看到苏联修正主义领导人以及他们在苏丹或其他地方的追随者，都不过是为美帝国主义服务的可怜的雇佣集团。他说，毛泽东思想是七亿多人民几十年来史无前例的艰苦革命斗争的实际经验的生动体现和光辉总结。因此，毛泽东思想是中国人民给予亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民和全世界人民的最珍贵的礼物。人民斗争中每一天都在提供新的证明。证明毛泽东思想是正确的，战无不胜的，是具有洞悉一切的威力的。
    巴基斯坦代表团团长肖卡特·西迪基说，巴基斯坦人民将永远不会忘记中国人民和他们的政府在印度以它的全部武装力量的怯懦地侵犯巴基斯坦的那个我国历史上最关键性的时刻，给予我们真挚的支持。他在讲话中赞扬中国人民取得的伟大成就，是人类历史上无与伦比的。
    刚果（利）代表团团长基布韦·康士坦丁说，亚非作家紧急会议的成功是我们两洲人民的伟大胜利，是对美帝及其帮凶的一个大挑战，是对进行反侵略斗争的越南人民的巨大支持。他说，当我们回到非洲后，我们将回忆中国人民在毛泽东思想照耀下，在共产党总路线的指引下，鼓足干劲、自力更生在各个方面出现了大跃进。这向我们表明：当人民能够依靠自己的力量自由地工作时，他们能做出什么样的事情。
    中国人民的这一切，归功于他们的领袖毛泽东的创造性的天才和共产党的正确领导。毛泽东同志的思想是斗争的人民的胜利的保证和全世界的财产，是全世界无产阶级取得正义战争胜利的指南针。
    菲律宾代表团团长阿马多·埃尔南德斯在讲话时谴责美帝国主义侵略越南的罪行，谴责苏联修正主义充当美帝帮凶出卖越南人民的罪恶活动后说，中国是被压迫者反抗压迫者的先锋。长期遭受奴役与剥削的非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲的新兴国家将团结在新中国这个世界革命的伟大而崇高的先锋和她的无可比拟的领袖和导师的周围，这位领袖和导师也就是世界上所有革命者的无可相比的英雄和指路人——我们敬爱的毛泽东主席！
    坦桑尼亚代表团团长叶海雅·穆罕默德·哈桑尼在讲话中，严厉谴责了苏联修正主义者破坏和分裂亚非作家运动的罪恶活动。他说，我们必须提高警惕，加强战斗。亚非作家运动是个革命运动。这个运动正在进行一场反对帝国主义及其走狗和反动派的战斗。他说，毛泽东思想不但是中国人民取得胜利的指路明灯，而且也是世界各国人民取得胜利的指路明灯。毛泽东思想不但照亮了中国工农兵，而且远远超过了中国边界，照亮了世界上的广大劳动人民。任何人，不论是在中国或在别的地方，只要是用毛泽东思想武装起来，就一定能取得胜利。
    印度尼西亚代表阿甘姆·维斯比在发言中，谈到自己在我国各地进行访问的感想。他说，参观访问给我们留下了深刻的印象，那就是中国目前正在开展一个广泛深入学习毛主席著作的运动高潮。我们也看到了中国正在开展轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命运动，这是世界文化史上无比的大事件。他说，目前，纳苏蒂安—苏哈托军事法西斯集团，在破坏和污辱中国印度尼西亚人民友好关系方面，进行了比希特勒纳粹更为野蛮的行为。这些美帝的傀儡在印度尼西亚和世界人民面前，暴露其反动本质。正在觉醒的印度尼西亚人民把这些傀儡，从他们的宝座上扔到垃圾堆里的时刻即将到来。
    郭沫若、张承宗和外国朋友们的讲话，都一次又一次地被暴风雨般的掌声所打断。有的外国朋友在讲话结束时，同全场群众一起高呼反帝革命口号。
    大会结束时，全场起立，口号声、欢呼声、鼓掌声如雷如潮，震荡回响，久久不息。
    出席亚非作家紧急会议的中国代表团副团长许广平、巴金、刘白羽，以及代表团部分团员出席了今晚的欢送大会。参加大会的还有上海有关方面负责人和作家。
    会后，外国朋友们观看了大型歌舞剧《椰林怒火》。
