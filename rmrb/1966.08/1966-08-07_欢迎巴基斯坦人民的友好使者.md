A delegation from the Pakistani Parliament, led by National Assembly Speaker Abdul Jabbar Khan, arrived in Beijing today for a friendly visit to our country. The Chinese people warmly welcome the friendly envoys of the Pakistani people.

China and Pakistan are friendly neighbors. In recent years, the two countries have successfully developed friendly cooperative relations on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. In particular, President Ayub Khan's visit to our country last year and Chairman Liu Shaoqi's visit to Pakistan this spring have brought about new significant developments in Sino-Pakistani friendship.

The peoples of China and Pakistan have always been sympathetic and supportive of each other in their struggles to maintain national independence and sovereignty, to oppose imperialism and colonialism, and to resist foreign aggression and threats. The friendship between China and Pakistan, built on this common struggle, is deep and enduring, and cannot be destroyed by any forces hostile to Sino-Pakistani friendship. This friendship serves the fundamental interests of the peoples of both countries and is conducive to peace in Asia and the world. As stated in the joint communiqué issued during Chairman Liu Shaoqi's visit to Pakistan, "Sino-Pakistani friendship is not a temporary expedient but is based on a solid foundation."

The Pakistani people are a hardworking, brave, and freedom-loving people. When their homeland is subjected to armed attacks, they rise up to fight, resolutely striking back at the aggressors, and demonstrating a high degree of patriotism and heroism. The Chinese people greatly admire the fearless fighting spirit of the Pakistani people and firmly stand on the side of the Pakistani people, supporting their just struggle to maintain national sovereignty and independence. In the future, the Chinese people will, as always, be the most reliable friends of the Pakistani people in their struggle against aggression.

Today, the situation in the struggle of the Asian peoples against imperialism is excellent. Asia is no longer the Asia that can be carved up at will. The Asian peoples have not only stood up but are also at the forefront of the world's anti-imperialist struggle. The Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation has dealt a heavy blow to American imperialism, making it lose its way and retreat. The victory of the Vietnamese people has boosted the morale of the Asian peoples and shattered the arrogance of imperialism and reactionaries. No matter how desperately American imperialism struggles and counterattacks, whether it escalates the war in Vietnam or directs its aggression towards the Chinese people, it cannot intimidate the Vietnamese and Chinese peoples, nor can it stop the historical tide of the Asian peoples' struggle for and defense of national independence. The more frantically American imperialism struggles and acts recklessly, the faster and more miserable its defeat will be; the day it is driven out of Vietnam and out of Asia will come sooner.

The solidarity and friendship between the peoples of China and Pakistan are developing day by day amidst the victory of the Asian peoples' anti-imperialist struggle. We believe that the visit of the Pakistani Parliamentary Delegation to China will definitely make new contributions to further strengthening the friendly cooperative relations between the two peoples.

### 欢迎巴基斯坦人民的友好使者

    欢迎巴基斯坦人民的友好使者
    巴基斯坦议会访华代表团，在国民议会议长阿卜杜勒·贾巴尔·汗的率领下，来我国进行友好访问，今天到达北京。中国人民热烈欢迎巴基斯坦人民的友好使者。
    中国和巴基斯坦是友好的近邻。近几年来，两国
    在和平共处五项原则的基础上，顺利地发展着友好合作关系。特别是去年阿尤布·汗总统来我国访问和今春刘少奇主席访问巴基斯坦，使中巴友好有了新的重大发展。
    中巴两国人民在维护国家的独立和主权、反对帝国主义和殖民主义、反对外来侵略和威胁的斗争中，一直是相互同情，相互支持的。建立在这一共同斗争基础上的中巴友谊，是深厚的，是经得住考验的，是任何敌视中巴友好的势力破坏不了的。这种友谊符合中巴两国人民的根本利益，有利于亚洲和世界和平。正如刘少奇主席访问巴基斯坦时双方发表的联合公报所说，“中巴友好不是权宜之计，是有牢固基础的。”
    巴基斯坦人民是勤劳勇敢、热爱自由的人民。当他们的祖国遭到武装进攻时，他们奋起抗战，坚决打击侵略者，表现出高度的爱国主义精神和英雄气概。中国人民十分敬佩巴基斯坦人民这种无畏的斗争精神，并且坚决站在巴基斯坦人民一边，支援他们为维护国家主权和独立而进行的正义斗争。今后，中国人民将一如既往，在巴基斯坦人民反对侵略的斗争中，永远是他们最可靠的朋友。
    今天，亚洲人民反对帝国主义斗争的形势很好。现在的亚洲早已不是任人宰割的亚洲了。亚洲人民不但已经站起来，并且站在世界人民反帝斗争的最前列。越南人民的抗美救国斗争，把美帝国主义打得丢盔弃甲，就是一个光辉的例子。越南人民的胜利长了亚洲人民的志气，灭了帝国主义和反动派的威风。不管美帝国主义怎样挣扎和反扑，把侵越战争“升级”也好，把侵略矛头指向中国人民也好，它既吓不倒越南人民和中国人民，也阻挡不住亚洲人民争取和维护民族独立的历史潮流。美帝国主义愈是疯狂挣扎，愈是蛮干，它就会失败得愈快、愈惨；它被赶出越南，赶出亚洲的日子，就会来得愈早。
    中巴两国人民的团结和友好，在亚洲人民反帝斗争的胜利声中日益发展。我们相信，巴基斯坦议会访华代表团的这次访问，定将为进一步加强两国人民的友好合作关系，作出新的贡献。
