Soviet revisionists are the masterminds behind the split in the Afro-Asian writers' movement
U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists are both enemies of the Vietnamese people
The Bureau calls on Afro-Asian writers to fully support the success of the next Afro-Asian Writers' Conference

Senanayake read the "Communiqué on the Establishment of the Executive Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau." The full text is as follows:

In accordance with the "Resolution on Strengthening the Afro-Asian Writers' Movement" adopted at the Emergency Meeting of Afro-Asian Writers held in Beijing and the decision made at the July 12, 1966, meeting of the Permanent Bureau to establish the Executive Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau in Beijing, today, August 15, 1966, I, as the Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau, formally announce the establishment of the Executive Secretariat in the capital of the People's Republic of China, Beijing.

New China News Agency, August 15th: At the inaugural meeting of the Executive Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau, Secretary-General R.D. Senanayake read the "Statement of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau on the Further Splitist Activities of the Soviet Revisionists." The full text is as follows:

The Emergency Meeting of Afro-Asian Writers held in Beijing from June 27 to July 9, 1966, with representatives from 53 countries and regions, was a great victory and a milestone in the history of the Afro-Asian writers' movement. It made a significant contribution to the unity and genuine solidarity of Afro-Asian writers in their revolutionary struggle against imperialism and its accomplices. It also correctly distinguished between progressives and reactionaries, revolutionaries and traitors. The communiqué of the Emergency Meeting, while preemptively condemning various splitist plots and attempts that may arise before the next conference, also called on Afro-Asian writers to be vigilant against the further splitist activities of the Soviet revisionists.

In accordance with the decisions of the Emergency Meeting, the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau is making all necessary arrangements to ensure the greater success of the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference to be held in China.

Meanwhile, the Bureau has noted that Soviet splitists are stepping up their sabotage activities and are attempting to hold a splitist meeting in Baku. Thus, they have gone further down the path of splitism and in their fundamental struggle against the Afro-Asian writers and their leadership.

This attempt was recently highlighted in a statement published in the Soviet government newspaper *Izvestia* regarding the preparations for the splitist meeting in Baku. This statement was issued by a person named Shava Azimov, who is allegedly the chairman of the Soviet Afro-Asian Writers' Liaison Committee, on August 7, 1966. In this statement, the Soviet splitists slander the leadership of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau, saying that they "handle matters far from being sober-minded."

In this statement, after attempting to justify the illegal Cairo splitist meeting, the Soviet splitists revealed their plot for the Baku splitist meeting.

It is necessary to recall that the Emergency Meeting of Afro-Asian Writers has already condemned and strongly denounced the Cairo splitist meeting and the so-called proposal to hold a writers' conference in Baku, Azerbaijan, Soviet Union. It has also clearly exposed the Soviet splitists as the chief culprits behind all the betrayal and splitist activities that have undermined the unity of Afro-Asian writers and the entire anti-imperialist solidarity of the Afro-Asian peoples.

The statement published in *Izvestia* on August 7, 1966, by the Soviet splitists has confirmed that the stance taken by the Emergency Meeting of Afro-Asian Writers in this regard is correct. The statement of the Soviet splitists once again openly exposed their own role as the masterminds, who have committed various crimes of conspiracy and sabotage against the movement since its inception.

The Soviet splitists slander the Permanent Bureau as being unsound, which only shows their shameless attempt to impose their will on the Bureau, to spread their revisionist capitulationist policy among Afro-Asian writers, with the aim of undermining the revolutionary spirit and struggle of Afro-Asian writers and peoples, and to create a "sober-minded" atmosphere to further push their line of full cooperation with U.S. imperialism to dominate the world.

The Afro-Asian writers' movement was born as a component of the solidarity of the Afro-Asian peoples in their struggle against U.S.-led imperialism and old and new colonialism, aiming to achieve and maintain national independence, and to develop national culture, literature, and traditions. The Soviet splitists persistently demand that our movement's activities be limited to the literary sphere and that politics not be discussed. This is a reactionary view that goes against the purpose of the Afro-Asian writers' movement and attempts to make us deviate from the correct revolutionary path of the Afro-Asian writers' movement.

The Soviet splitists also claim that they are holding the so-called Baku meeting to strengthen solidarity with the heroic Vietnamese people.

It must be pointed out here: It is precisely in the issue of supporting the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people against U.S. aggression that the Soviet revisionists are openly carrying out splitist activities in our movement. When the Permanent Bureau sought their agreement to hold an emergency meeting of Afro-Asian writers to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression, they questioned in a telegram to the Secretary-General whether such a meeting was necessary. They ignored the positive responses from more than fifty countries to the Bureau's call and exerted every effort to prevent the meeting from being held. Why did they do this? Because they did not want to give genuine support to the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression. This is very clear in the statement issued by the Soviet splitists in *Izvestia* on August 7, 1966. They do not demand the immediate withdrawal of all U.S. troops and their puppet forces from South Vietnam and the immediate dismantling of all U.S. military bases in South Vietnam. They go against the wishes of the Vietnamese people in their struggle, as reiterated by Chairman Ho Chi Minh in his "Letter to the Nation" on July 17, 1966: "It is well known that every time the U.S. bandits prepare to intensify their criminal war, they play the trick of so-called 'peace talks' to deceive world public opinion and to shift the blame for not wanting 'peace talks' onto Vietnam!... The U.S. must stop its aggression against Vietnam, must withdraw all its troops and puppet forces from Vietnam, and then peace will be immediately restored. Vietnam's position is clear: this is the four-point proposal of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. There is no other way!"

The Soviet revisionists, however, have always sought other means. During the U.S. escalation of the war in Vietnam, the Soviet revisionist group has always played the role of the first accomplice. After the U.S. criminally bombed Hanoi and Haiphong, Moscow became the center for plotting "bombing for peace" with U.S. imperialism. The Soviet splitists' call for the Baku splitist meeting is an attempt to deceive people with the U.S.'s "peace talks" trick. It is now clear that U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists are both enemies of the Vietnamese people and of the peoples of Africa, Asia, and the world.

Regarding the crimes of the Soviet splitists against the revolutionary cause of Afro-Asian writers and peoples, the stance of the Emergency Meeting of Afro-Asian Writers is very clear. No matter what means they use, no matter how frantically they play their shameful tricks to betray the struggle of the Afro-Asian peoples, their plots will surely meet with complete failure. Afro-Asian writers will closely unite with the Afro-Asian peoples, take bigger and more determined steps forward to greater victories.

The Bureau calls on all Afro-Asian writers to heighten vigilance, expose the treacherous plot of the Soviet splitists, and take all necessary actions to counter their tricks, holding high the banner of unity and revolution, and fighting alongside the combative Afro-Asian peoples against their common enemy, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys and defenders.

　　苏修是分裂亚非作家运动的主谋

    新华社十五日讯　亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克在亚非作家常设局执行书记处成立会上宣读的《亚非作家常设局成立执行书记处的公报》，全文如下：
    根据在北京召开的亚非作家紧急会议所通过的《加强亚非作家运动的决议》以及一九六六年七月十二日常设局会议关于在北京设立亚非作家常设局执行书记处的决定，今天，一九六六年八月十五日，我作为亚非作家常设局的秘书长，正式宣布执行书记处在中华人民共和国首都北京成立。
    执行书记处将立即开始它协助完成亚非作家紧急会议和常设局的决定以及筹备在中国召开第三届亚非作家大会的工作。
    根据亚非作家紧急会议的精神，常设局号召所有亚非作家全力支持和协助常设局以及新成立的执行书记处，使第三届亚非作家大会获得巨大成功，提高警惕，加强团结，并积极投入亚非人民的斗争，回击和粉碎以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗和头号帮凶苏联修正主义者的分裂活动，取得最后胜利。
            常设局秘书长Ｒ·Ｄ·森纳那亚克
                  一九六六年八月十五日　北京
    新华社十五日讯　亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克在亚非作家常设局执行书记处成立会上宣读的《亚非作家常设局关于苏联修正主义者的进一步分裂活动的声明》，全文如下：
    一九六六年六月二十七日到七月九日在北京举行的、由五十三个国家和地区的代表参加的亚非作家紧急会议是一个很大的胜利，是亚非作家运动史上的一个里程碑。它对亚非作家团结和真正地一致反对帝国主义者及其帮凶的革命事业作出了巨大的贡献。它也正确地截然区分了进步者和反动派，革命者和叛徒。紧急会议的公报在预先谴责下一届大会之前可能出现的各种分裂阴谋和企图的同时，也号召亚非作家警惕苏联修正主义者的进一步分裂活动。
    根据紧急会议的决定，亚非作家常设局正在作出一切安排，使在中国召开的第三届亚非作家大会获得更大的成功。
    与此同时，常设局已经注意到，苏联分裂主义者正在加紧破坏活动，并且还企图要在巴库召开一个分裂会议。这样，他们在分裂主义道路上以及在反对亚非作家和它的领导机构的根本战斗路线的罪恶活动的道路上滑得更远了。
    这种企图最近突出地表现在苏联政府报纸《消息报》所刊登的一个有关筹备巴库分裂会议的声明之中，这声明是由一个据称是苏联亚非作家联络委员会的主席名叫沙瓦·阿齐莫夫的人于一九六六年八月七日发表的。在这个声明中，苏联分裂主义者诬蔑亚非作家常设局的领导“处理事情远远不是清醒的”。
    在这个声明中，苏联分裂主义者在企图为非法的开罗分裂会议辩解之后，就透露出了他们巴库分裂会议的阴谋。
    这里必须回顾一下，亚非作家紧急会议已经抨击和强烈谴责了开罗的分裂会议以及在苏联阿塞拜疆的巴库召开一个作家会议的所谓建议，也已经清楚地揭露了苏联分裂主义者是所有破坏亚非作家团结和整个亚非人民反帝团结事业的背叛和分裂活动的罪魁祸首。
    《消息报》于一九六六年八月七日所刊登的苏联分裂主义者的声明就印证了亚非作家紧急会议在这方面采取的立场是正确的。苏联分裂主义者的这个声明再一次公开地暴露了他们自己是主谋犯，从亚非作家运动一开始他们就犯下了对运动进行阴谋破坏的各种罪行。
    苏联分裂主义者诬蔑常设局不清醒，这只能表明他们无耻地想要把他们的意志强加给常设局，在亚非作家中扩展他们修正主义的投降政策，目的在于破坏亚非作家和人民的革命精神以及他们的斗争，制造一种“清醒”的气氛以便加紧推行同美帝国主义进行全面合作主宰世界的路线。
    亚非作家运动是作为亚非人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的团结的一个组成部分而产生的，旨在争取和维护民族独立，发展民族文化、文学和传统。苏联分裂主义者一再坚持要求：我们运动的活动应该局限在文学范围之内，不应谈政治，这是一个违背亚非作家运动宗旨的反动的观点，妄想使我们脱离亚非作家运动的正确革命路线。
    苏联分裂主义分子也诡称：他们召开所谓的巴库会议是为了加强同英雄的越南人民的团结。
    这里必须严正指出：正是在支持英雄的越南人民反美斗争的问题上，苏联修正主义者公开进行分裂我们运动的活动。当常设局在征求他们同意举行支持越南人民反对美国侵略的亚非作家紧急会议的时候，他们在给秘书长的电报中反问这种会议是否必要。他们无视五十多个国家对常设局的号召所作出的肯定的答复，并竭尽一切努力企图阻止这次会议的召开。他们为什么这样做呢？因为他们不想给越南人民抗美救国斗争以真正的支援。这一点在苏联分裂主义者一九六六年八月七日在《消息报》上发表的声明中非常清楚。他们不要求立即从南越撤出所有的美军及其仆从军，立即撤销所有美国在南越的军事基地。他们违背了一九六六年七月十七日胡志明主席《告全国同胞书》中所重申的在战斗中的越南人民的愿望。胡志明主席在《告全国同胞书》中说：“众所周知：美国强盗每逢准备加强罪恶战争时，就玩弄所谓‘和平谈判’的骗人把戏，妄图蒙骗世界舆论，并且把不愿‘和平谈判’的罪名强加给越南！……美国必须停止侵略越南的战争，必须把美国军队和它的帮凶军全部撤出越南，这样和平就会立即恢复。越南的立场是明确的：这就是越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明。此外，没有其他办法！”
    苏联修正主义者却一直在谋求其它办法。在美国扩大侵越战争过程中，苏联修正主义集团一直在扮演着第一号帮凶的角色。在美国罪恶地轰炸了河内和海防以后，莫斯科成了同美帝国主义策划“以炸迫和”的中心。苏联分裂主义者召开巴库分裂会议，就是妄想要以美国的“和平谈判”骗局来欺骗人们。现在非常清楚，美帝国主义者以及苏联修正主义者都是越南人民的敌人，也是非洲、亚洲和全世界人民的敌人。
    对于苏联分裂主义者反对亚非作家和亚非人民革命事业的罪行，亚非作家紧急会议的立场是非常清楚的。不管他们采取什么手段，不管他们怎样疯狂地玩弄无耻的阴谋来出卖亚非人民的斗争，他们的计谋必将遭到彻底的失败。亚非作家必将同亚非人民紧密地团结在一起，迈开更大更坚定的步伐朝着更大的胜利前进。
    常设局呼吁所有的亚非作家提高警惕，揭露苏联分裂主义者策划的这一背信弃义的罪恶阴谋，采取一切必要的行动来回击他们的阴谋诡计，高举团结和革命的旗帜，同战斗的亚非人民一起进行反对他们共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶和辩护士的斗争。
