The Chinese People's Liberation Army has been established for 39 years today.

The great army of the people, personally founded and directly led by Comrade Mao Zedong, has, over the past few decades, in the revolutionary war years, in the long and arduous struggle against domestic and foreign class enemies, and after the victory of the entire nation, in the tasks of defending and building a socialist motherland and defending peace in the Far East and the world, always maintained and carried forward the glorious tradition of being "a fighting force, a work force, and a production force." In recent years, the army has, in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee, the Central Military Commission, and Comrade Lin Biao, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works actively, emphasized proletarian politics, carried forward the spirit of the August 1st, participated in the socialist education movement and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, participated in and supported socialist construction, and has made great strides on the road of proletarianization, revolutionization, and militarization.

The masses of the Chinese people have always regarded the PLA as a model for learning. Since 1964, the people of the entire nation have responded to the great call of Comrade Mao Zedong, launching a wave of learning from the PLA. This has played a tremendous role in promoting China's socialist revolution and socialist construction.

Recently, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: The People's Liberation Army should be a great university. This great university should study politics, military affairs, culture, and also engage in agricultural and sideline production, and run some small and medium-sized factories to produce some of the products needed by the army and products for equivalent exchange with the state. This great university should also engage in mass work, participate in the socialist education movement in factories and rural areas; after the socialist education movement, there is always mass work to be done, so that the army and the people are always united; and it should also participate in the criticism of the bourgeois cultural revolution at any time. In this way, the army can combine military affairs, agriculture, industry, and the people. Of course, it should be properly arranged, with a main focus and secondary focus. Agriculture, industry, and the people—each unit can only combine one or two of these, not all at the same time. In this way, the role of several million troops will be very great.

To turn the people's army into a revolutionary great university is Comrade Mao Zedong's consistent idea. We have done this in the past. Now, Comrade Mao Zedong, based on new circumstances, has put forward higher requirements for the PLA.

Comrade Mao Zedong calls on the people of the entire nation to turn our country's factories, rural people's communes, schools, commerce, service industries, and party and government agencies into revolutionary great universities like the PLA.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out:

Workers should focus on work but also learn military affairs, politics, and culture. They should also carry out the socialist education movement and criticize the bourgeoisie. In places with conditions, they should also engage in agricultural and sideline production, such as the Daqing Oil Field.

Communards should focus on agriculture (including forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries) but also learn military affairs, politics, and culture. When conditions permit, they should also run small factories collectively and criticize the bourgeoisie.

Students should focus on learning but also learn other subjects, that is, not only learn literature but also learn industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and criticize the bourgeoisie. The school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools should no longer continue.

For commerce, service industries, and party and government agency personnel, those with conditions should also do the same.

Comrade Mao Zedong's brilliant idea has great historical significance.

Comrade Mao Zedong has summed up various experiences of China's socialist revolution and socialist construction, studied various experiences of the international proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship since the October Revolution, especially drawn serious lessons from the restoration of capitalism by the Khrushchev revisionist clique in the Soviet Union, and creatively answered the questions of how to prevent the restoration of capitalism, consolidate proletarian dictatorship, and ensure a gradual transition to communism with scientific answers.

The idea that Comrade Mao Zedong proposed for various industries to become revolutionary great universities that are both industrial and agricultural, both cultural and military, is our program.

By doing as Comrade Mao Zedong said, we can greatly enhance the proletarian consciousness of the Chinese people, promote the revolutionization of people's thinking, and promote the break with all the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits left over from the old society. Thus, we can further build socialism more, better, faster, and more economically, and more quickly eliminate the social and ideological bases of capitalism and revisionism.

By doing as Comrade Mao Zedong said, we can promote the gradual narrowing of the gap between workers and peasants, between urban and rural areas, and between manual and mental labor, avoid the abnormal development of cities and industry, make intellectuals labor, laborers intellectual, and cultivate millions of new communists with high political awareness and all-around development.

By doing as Comrade Mao Zedong said, we can realize the militarization of the entire people and greatly strengthen our preparedness. If imperialism dares to invade us, it will be drowned in the vast sea of people's war.

By doing as Comrade Mao Zedong said, the 700 million people of our country will all become critics of the old world, builders and defenders of the new world. They can use a hammer to work, a hoe to farm, a rifle to fight the enemy, and a pen to write articles.

In this way, the entire nation will be a university of Mao Zedong Thought, a university of communism.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army has, over the past few decades, acted according to Comrade Mao Zedong's idea and is still developing and improving. The PLA is the best university for learning Mao Zedong Thought. Factories, rural people's communes, schools, shops, service industries, and party and government agencies throughout the country should take the PLA as an example and become universities of Mao Zedong Thought.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals, all Communist Party members, should draw boundless strength, wisdom, and courage from Comrade Mao Zedong's brilliant directive and strive to accomplish the great historical tasks proposed by the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong.

    全国都应该成为毛泽东思想的大学校
    ——纪念中国人民解放军建军三十九周年
    中国人民解放军成立到今天，已经三十九周年了。
    毛泽东同志亲手缔造和直接领导的这支伟大的人民军队，几十年来，在革命战争年代，在同国内外阶级敌人长期艰苦的战斗中，在全国胜利以后，在担负保卫和建设社会主义祖国、保卫远东和世界和平的任务中，一直保持和发扬了“既是战斗队，又是工作队，又是生产队”的光荣传统。近几年来，解放军根据党中央、中央军委和林彪同志的指示，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，大力突出无产阶级政治，发扬三八作风，参加社会主义教育运动和无产阶级文化大革命，参加和支援社会主义建设，在无产阶级化、革命化、战斗化的道路上，又大大迈进了一步。
    我国人民群众历来都把解放军作为学习的榜样。一九六四年以来，全国人民响应毛泽东同志的伟大号召，掀起了大学解放军的热潮。这对推动我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设，发挥了巨大的作用。
    最近，毛泽东同志指出：人民解放军应该是一个大学校。这个大学校，要学政治，学军事，学文化，又能从事农副业生产，又能办一些中小工厂，生产自己需要的若干产品和与国家等价交换的产品。这个大学校，又能从事群众工作，参加工厂、农村的社会主义教育运动；社会主义教育运动完了，随时都有群众工作可做，使军民永远打成一片；又要随时参加批判资产阶级的文化革命斗争。这样，军学、军农、军工、军民这几项都可以兼起来。当然，要调配适当，要有主有从，农、工、民三项，一个部队只能兼一项或两项，不能同时都兼起来。这样，几百万军队所起的作用就是很大的了。
    把人民的军队办成革命的大学校，这是毛泽东同志的一贯的思想。我们过去就是这样做的。现在，毛泽东同志根据新的情况，又对解放军提出了更高的要求。
    毛泽东同志号召全国人民，把我国的工厂、农村人民公社、学校、商业、服务行业、党政机关也都要象解放军那样，办成革命化的大学校。
    毛泽东同志指出：
    工人以工为主，也要兼学军事、政治、文化。也要搞社会主义教育运动，也妥批判资产阶级。在有条件的地方，也要从事农副业生产，例如大庆油田那样。
    公社农民以农为主（包括林、牧、副、渔），也要兼学军事、政治、文化。在有条件的时候，也要由集体办些小工厂，也要批判资产阶级。
    学生也是这样，以学为主，兼学别样，即不但学文，也要学工、学农、学军，也要批判资产阶级。学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。
    商业、服务行业、党政机关工作人员，凡有条件的，也要这样做。
    毛泽东同志这个光辉的思想，具有伟大的历史意义。
    毛泽东同志总结了我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的各种经验，研究了十月革命以来国际无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的各种经验，特别是吸取了苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团实行资本主义复辟的严重教训，创造性地对如何防止资本主义复辟、巩固无产阶级专政、保证逐步向共产主义过渡这些问题，作出了科学的答案。
    毛泽东同志提出的各行各业都要办成亦工亦农，亦文亦武的革命化大学校的思想，就是我们的纲领。
    按照毛泽东同志所说的去做，就可以大大提高我国人民的无产阶级意识，促进人们的思想革命化，促进人们同旧社会遗留下来的一切旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯决裂。从而能够进一步又多又快又好又省地建设社会主义，能够更快地铲除资本主义、修正主义的社会基础和思想基础。
    按照毛泽东同志所说的去做，就可以促进逐步缩小工农差别、城乡差别、体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别，就可以避免城市和工业的畸形发展，就可以使知识分子劳动化，劳动人民知识化，就可以培养出有高度政治觉悟的、全面发展的亿万共产主义新人。
    按照毛泽东同志说的去做，就可以实现全民皆兵，大大加强我们的战备工作。帝国主义胆敢侵犯我们，就会被淹没在人民战争的汪洋大海之中。
    按照毛泽东同志说的去做，我国七亿人民就都会成为旧世界的批判者，新世界的建设者和保卫者。他们拿起锤子就能做工，拿起锄头犁把就能种田，拿起枪杆子就能打敌人，拿起笔杆子就能写文章。
    这样，全国就都是毛泽东思想的大学校，都是共产主义的大学校。
    中国人民解放军，几十年来就是按照毛泽东同志的这一思想办事的，现在还在不断发展提高。解放军是最好的学习毛泽东思想的大学校。全国的工厂、农村人民公社、学校、商店、服务行业、党政机关，都要以解放军为榜样，办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    广大的工农兵群众、革命干部和革命的知识分子，所有的共产党员，都要从毛泽东同志的这个英明指示中，吸取无穷的力量、智慧和勇气，为实现党和毛泽东同志提出的伟大历史任务而斗争。
