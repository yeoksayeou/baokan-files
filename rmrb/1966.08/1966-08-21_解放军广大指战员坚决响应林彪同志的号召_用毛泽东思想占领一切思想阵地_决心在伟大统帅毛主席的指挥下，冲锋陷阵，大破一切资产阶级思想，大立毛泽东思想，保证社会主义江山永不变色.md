The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to occupy all ideological battlefields with Mao Zedong Thought. They are determined, under the command of the great helmsman Chairman Mao, to charge into battle, smash all bourgeois ideology, and establish Mao Zedong Thought, ensuring that the socialist state will never change color.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 20th, Comrade Lin Biao issued a call at the Beijing mass rally celebrating the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution: "Establish Mao Zedong Thought and use it to change the spiritual face of the entire society." The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army resolutely respond to this call, determined to, under the personal leadership and command of the great helmsman Chairman Mao, launch a fierce total assault on bourgeois and all exploitative class ideologies, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly over all ideological battlefields.

The broad masses of soldiers and officers regard Comrade Lin Biao's call as a new battle command issued by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to the 700 million people and to all soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army. They say, "We must, under the personal leadership and command of Chairman Mao, charge into battle, sweep away all bourgeois ideologies, establish Mao Zedong Thought, and ensure that the socialist state will never change color."

The soldiers and officers of the Fourth Model Company of the Artillery Second Company of a certain unit in the Nanjing Military Region, who have been rated as a model company for consecutive years, were excited after hearing Comrade Lin Biao's call. They shouted, "Open fire on the 'Four Olds'! Attack the 'Four Olds'!" The entire company's soldiers and officers wrote letters of determination, responding to this call. The company also specially convened a meeting to break with the old and establish the new, where many soldiers of student origin denounced the poisoning of their souls by the bourgeois education system and vowed to use Mao Zedong Thought to sweep away all old ideas. Many active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the Shenyang Military Region said, "A few years ago, Comrade Lin Biao called on us to definitely master Mao Zedong Thought. We followed Comrade Lin Biao's teachings and launched a mass movement to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, which greatly promoted the revolutionization of our thinking. In this new stage of the socialist revolution, Comrade Lin Biao again calls on us to establish Mao Zedong Thought, which has even deeper significance." Deputy Political Instructor Wang Daoming of the Third Company of a certain unit, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, said, "I resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I will break with all the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes, and use Mao Zedong Thought to occupy all ideological battlefields. Let Mao Zedong Thought, this great spiritual atomic bomb, become a mighty material force that conquers and defeats everything."

Many soldiers and officers discussed and studied Comrade Lin Biao's great call, enthusiastically sharing their personal experiences and discussing the great significance of establishing Mao Zedong Thought. They said, "Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman. Only by establishing Mao Zedong Thought can we ensure that in any sharp and complex class struggle, on both the military and cultural fronts, we will always see clearly and stand firmly, never changing color, and always be revolutionary." Deputy Political Instructor Fu Jinquan of the "Sea Tiger Boat" of a certain unit in the Navy said, "The victories of many sea battles in recent years are all victories of Mao Zedong Thought! With Mao Zedong Thought, people are the most selfless, the most intelligent, and the most courageous. They can face any difficulty, overcome any enemy, and defeat any enemy. With Mao Zedong Thought as our guide, we can dispel the fog, break through the stormy waves, and march from victory to victory." The soldiers and officers of the Third Border Defense Company of a certain unit in the Kunming Military Region said, "Our company has been rated as a model company for five consecutive years. This is the result of being nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. Studying Chairman Mao's works has brightened our eyes, helping us distinguish between friends and enemies. Mao Zedong Thought has united us with the people of all ethnic minorities on the border, firmly standing on the frontier defense line of our motherland. We have unlimited love, faith, and admiration for Chairman Mao. Even if it means climbing mountains of knives or crossing seas of fire, we will follow Chairman Mao in making the revolution. Whoever opposes Mao Zedong Thought, we will resolutely fight to the end."

Many soldiers and officers immediately took action after studying Comrade Lin Biao's speech. They more consciously followed Comrade Lin Biao's instructions to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, transform their souls, and promote the revolutionization of their thinking. Many soldiers and officers took up their pens, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, to further carry out the struggle against bourgeois ideology. Soldiers and officers in many units in Guangzhou, Beijing, Jinan, Lanzhou, Chengdu, and Wuhan also enthusiastically propagated Mao Zedong Thought to the local masses.

    解放军广大指战员坚决响应林彪同志的号召
    用毛泽东思想占领一切思想阵地
    决心在伟大统帅毛主席的指挥下，冲锋陷阵，大破一切资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想，保证社会主义江山永不变色
    据新华社二十日讯  林彪同志在首都庆祝无产阶级文化大革命群众大会上发出号召：大立毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想改变整个社会的精神面貌。中国人民解放军广大指战员坚决响应这一号召，决心在伟大统帅毛主席的指挥下，向资产阶级和一切剥削阶级思想发动猛烈总攻击，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗插遍所有思想阵地。
    广大指战员把林彪同志的号召，看作是党中央、毛主席向七亿人民，向解放军全体指战员发出的新的战斗命令。他们说，我们一定要在毛主席的亲自领导和指挥下，冲锋陷阵，横扫一切资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想，保证社会主义江山永不变色。
    连年评为四好连的南京部队某部炮二连指战员，听到林彪同志的号召后，激动地高呼：向“四旧”开火！开火！向“四旧”猛攻！猛攻！全连指战员纷纷写决心书，响应这一号召。这个连还专门召开了破旧立新讲用会，许多学生出身的战士，在会上控诉了资产阶级教育制度对自己灵魂的毒害，决心用毛泽东思想扫除一切旧思想。沈阳部队许多学习毛主席著作积极分子说，几年以前，林彪同志号召我们，一定要把毛泽东思想学到手。我们遵循林彪同志教导，开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，有力地促进了思想革命化。在社会主义革命的新阶段，林彪同志又号召我们大立毛泽东思想，意义更为深刻。学习毛主席著作积极分子、某部三连副指导员王道明说，我坚决响应林彪同志的号召，在无产阶级文化大革命中，和一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯决裂，用毛泽东思想占领一切思想阵地，让毛泽东思想这个巨大的精神原子弹，变成征服一切、战胜一切的伟大物质力量。
    许多部队指战员在学习、座谈林彪同志的伟大号召时，纷纷用自己的亲身体会，畅谈大立毛泽东思想的重大意义。他们说，大海航行靠舵手。只有大立毛泽东思想，才能保证在任何尖锐、复杂的阶级斗争中，在文武两个战场上，永远眼睛看得清，脚跟站得稳，永不变色，永远革命。海军某部“海上猛虎艇”副指导员傅金泉说，几年来多次海战的胜利，都是毛泽东思想的胜利！有了毛泽东思想，人就最无私，最聪明，最勇敢，上刀山下火海，脸不变色心不跳，就能战胜任何困难，压倒一切敌人，消灭一切敌人。有了毛泽东思想作指南，就能拨开迷雾，冲破惊涛骇浪，从胜利走向胜利。昆明部队某边防三连指战员说，我们连队连续五年被评为四好连队，这是毛泽东思想哺育的结果。学习毛主席著作擦亮了我们的眼睛，使我们分清了谁是敌人，谁是朋友；毛泽东思想把我们和边疆各族人民紧密联系在一起，坚强地屹立在祖国的边防线上。我们对毛主席无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，那怕是上刀山，下火海，我们也要跟着毛主席闹革命。谁反对毛泽东思想，我们就坚决地和他斗到底。
    许多部队指战员学了林彪同志的讲话，立即行动。他们更自觉地按照林彪同志的指示，活学活用毛主席著作，改造灵魂，促进思想革命化。许多部队指战员拿起笔杆，以毛泽东思想为武器，进一步开展批判资产阶级思想的斗争。广州、北京、济南、兰州、成都、武汉等许多部队指战员，还纷纷向驻地群众宣传毛泽东思想。
