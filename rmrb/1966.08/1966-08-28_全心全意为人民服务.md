	Serve the People with All Your Heart
	Speaker: Huangshandong Brigade's Chief Instructor, Poor Peasant Ye Huasheng

	Chairman Mao's Quotations
	To die for the people's interests is weightier than Mount Tai; to work for the exploiters and oppressors of the people and to collude with the reactionaries in killing the people is lighter than a feather.
		— _In Memory of Norman Bethune_

	The Huangshandong Brigade has a group of instructors who study Chairman Mao's works. They are all farmers who have emerged as active learners in the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works. Their educational level is not high; the highest is junior high school, and many have only attended one or two years of school. However, their lectures are very good, profound, moving, lively, and are excellent examples of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They can broaden one's horizons. Those bourgeois "authorities" who slander the workers, peasants, and soldiers studying Chairman Mao's works as "pragmatism" and "vulgarization" should open their eyes and see how these peasant instructors use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to engage in the great struggle to change the world! Such lectures, full of lofty revolutionary sentiments and a strong fighting spirit, are something these bourgeois "authorities" will never be able to give!

	Today, our newspaper selects and publishes the lecture notes of the Huangshandong instructors on the "Three Constantly Read Articles," for everyone to read. These materials were compiled by the propaganda team of the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee based on the on-site recordings of the Huangshandong peasant instructors' lectures.

	I. Questions (Review, Inspiration)
	What is the core idea of "In Memory of Norman Bethune"? (Community members answer) Everyone answered correctly: to "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people, to serve the Chinese people and the people of the world with all your heart.

	But some people say: "Serving the people is not the farmers' business. Farmers have been working for generations just to fill their stomachs. They seek three meals a day and a place to sleep at night. A person's life is only a few decades long, just passing through this world. If they can eat well and dress well, their life has value." This way of thinking does not align with Chairman Mao's teachings on the correct attitude towards life and death.

	II. Read the Quotations (First demonstrate reading, then lead reading)

	III. Explanation
	This quotation is selected from "In Memory of Norman Bethune." More than twenty years ago, Chairman Mao, to commemorate the revolutionary martyr Zhang Side, called on everyone to learn from his spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly, and gave this speech.

	Who was Zhang Side? He was a soldier of the Central Committee's Guard Regiment, who joined the revolution in 1932, participated in the Long March of 25,000 li, was seriously injured, served as a soldier and platoon leader, and was an outstanding Communist Party member who faithfully served the people. In response to Chairman Mao's great call, he led a platoon into the mountains to make charcoal to support the front line in defeating Japanese imperialism and breaking the blockade of the Kuomintang bandits. The task was extremely arduous, and there were many difficulties. There were no vegetables to eat on the mountain, and they had to eat salted water with their meals; in the summer, there were many mosquitoes, and they couldn't sleep. Zhang Side led his comrades to think of many ways to overcome the difficulties. He always put himself in the most difficult situations and enjoyed the least. When carrying charcoal, while others carried one bundle, he carried two; while others chopped at most seventeen or eighteen trees a day, Zhang Side always chopped more than twenty. Those who worked with him all said he was a loyal revolutionary. On September 5, 1944, he unfortunately died in a charcoal pit collapse. Chairman Mao said that dying for the people's interests is weightier than Mount Tai. Like Zhang Side, there are countless revolutionary heroes such as Dong Cunrui, Huang Jiguang, Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and Ouyang Hai. Our Huangshandong also has such people. Like the revolutionary martyr Gu Laisheng, during the liberation war, he bravely charged against the Kuomintang bandits and sacrificed himself for the revolution. Everyone still remembers him and says that dying for the revolution and the people is truly glorious. Indeed, the revolutionary martyrs died for everyone's happiness, and their deaths are extremely valuable. If it were not for the brave sacrifices of the revolutionary martyrs, we would not have our happy lives today. Therefore, their deaths are weightier than Mount Tai.

	Those who are lighter than a feather are the few who serve as running dogs for the landlords, Kuomintang reactionaries, and imperialists. Like Li Gouren, the fake village head of Shijiao Village, who, before liberation, led the Kuomintang bandits to "suppress" Huangshandong, loot property, and persecute the people of Huangshandong. Everyone hates him to the bone, and he was executed. Now, more than ten years later, everyone still curses Li Gouren as a "cannon-firing ghost" and a "beheading ghost." Li Fugui of Jilong Mountain, who in the past also led the Kuomintang bandits to slaughter the people of Huangshandong. Today, he is dead, and everyone is still cursing him, saying he is more rotten than a dead snake or a rotten clam, rotten for tens of thousands of years. Why are these scoundrels so rotten? Because one person does evil, and ten thousand people suffer, with bloodstains that can never be washed clean.

	Therefore, we must listen to Chairman Mao's words and learn from Zhang Side to be people who live and die for the revolution and the people, who are weightier than Mount Tai. We must never be like Li Gouren and Li Fugui, who die for the exploiting classes and are lighter than a feather.

	After clarifying the issue of for whom one lives and dies, we must use Chairman Mao's thoughts to examine our past views on life. As mentioned earlier, the idea of "seeking three meals a day and a place to sleep at night" and "living and dying for one's own food and clothing" is wrong. Although such people do not live and die for the exploiting classes, they are equally valueless. Because such people are selfish and self-serving, they have not done anything good for the people, and they are not worth remembering after death. If everyone were like them, only seeking their own food and clothing to live and die, then the collective would not be able to function well and might even collapse, returning to the old capitalist road. At that time, some would become landlords, and some would become hired laborers. In this way, there would be no happy life for everyone. Therefore, we must uproot this bad idea of "seeking three meals a day and a place to sleep at night" and "living and dying for one's own food and clothing" and establish the idea of "living and dying for the people's interests."

	Living and dying for the people's interests means doing good deeds for the people while alive and making efforts for the revolution, and dying a worthy death that is worth learning from. Therefore, one's life should be spent making efforts for the revolution and the people. Like the old woman Chen Lin of Dangsheng Production Team, who reads Chairman Mao's books and listens to Chairman Mao's words, she is 83 years old but still worries about the team and voluntarily weeds out peanuts and other plants, earning everyone's respect. The 50-year-old accountant Tian Jinbo of Huangkeng Production Team delivers grain to community members, helps the sick find doctors, gets up in the middle of the night to protect farm tools and cattle, and manages the team's rice meticulously. Everyone calls him a good manager. We should learn from Chen Lin and Tian Jinbo to be people who are not afraid of hardship or fatigue, who till the land with all their heart for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. We cannot just see ourselves; we must see that three-tenths of the people in the world are still not liberated and are still oppressed and exploited, living in a dark world without light. We must always remember Chairman Mao's words, carry out the socialist revolution in our country to the end, support the world people's revolution, and help our class brothers stand up. In peacetime, we till the land for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, and in wartime, we fight for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, living and dying for the revolution and the people, and becoming people who are weightier than Mount Tai.

	IV. Discussion
		(1) For whom should one live and die to have value?
		(2) Is the idea of only seeking one's own food and clothing correct? Does such a person's life and death have meaning? Where will it lead? What harm does it cause?
		(3) What kind of person should we be in the future?

	V. Summary
	Tonight, everyone discussed very well. Some said: "We cannot be selfish and self-serving people. We must learn from Zhang Side to be wholeheartedly devoted to the revolution and the people, living greatly and dying gloriously." Some said: "We must put the collective first to become people who are weightier than Mount Tai!" Some said: "Only working hard for personal food and clothing is meaningless when one dies." Some said: "A person's life spent on eating and defecating is meaningless. We must work hard for the revolution and the collective to be glorious." Everyone spoke correctly. In the future, we must always remember Chairman Mao's words, live and die for the people's interests, and become people who are weightier than Mount Tai.

    全心全意为人民服务
    讲课人：黄山洞大队总辅导员、贫农  叶华盛
    毛主席语录
    为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重；替法西斯卖力，替剥削人民和压迫人民的人去死，就比鸿毛还轻。
                                《为人民服务》
    黄山洞大队有一批学习毛主席著作的辅导员，他们都是农民，是在学习毛主席著作的群众运动中涌现出来的学习积极分子。他们的文化程度并不高，最高的是初中，不少人只读过一、二年书。可是他们的辅导课却讲得很好，深刻感人，生动活泼，是活学活用毛主席著作的好经验，可以使人大开眼界。那些诬蔑工农兵学习毛主席著作是“实用主义”、“庸俗化”的资产阶级“权威”老爷们，你们还是睁开眼睛，看看这些农民辅导员是怎样运用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，进行改造世界的伟大斗争的吧！像这样充满高尚的革命感情和强烈的战斗风格的辅导课，你们这些老爷们是永远也讲不出来的！
    今天本报选登了黄山洞辅导员辅导“老三篇”的讲稿，供大家阅读。这些材料，是中共广东省委宣传部工作组根据黄山洞农民辅导员讲课的现场记录整理的。
                      ——编者
    一、提问（复习、启发）
    《为人民服务》的核心观点是什么？（社员回答）大家都答得对，要“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务，全心全意为中国人民和世界人民服务。
    但有人说：“为人民服务不是农民的事情。农民祖祖辈辈都是为着一个肚子。日求三餐，夜求一宿。人生几十年光景，阳间借路经过，能吃好穿好，一生就有价值。”这种讲法不符合毛主席关于正确对待生死问题的教导。
    二、读语录（先示范读，后领读）
    三、讲解
    这条语录是从《为人民服务》中选出来的。二十多年前，毛主席为了纪念革命烈士张思德同志，号召大家向他学习全心全意为人民服务的精神，作了这个讲演。
    张思德同志是什么样的人呢？他是中共中央警卫团的战士，一九三二年参加革命，经过二万五千里长征，受过重伤，当过战士、班长，是一个忠实为人民服务的优秀共产党员。他为了响应毛主席的伟大号召，支援前线打败日本帝国主义，打破蒋匪军的封锁，带一班人到深山去烧炭，烧出炭来给战士烤火过冬。当时任务非常艰巨，困难很多。山上没菜吃，用盐水下饭；夏天蚊子多，咬得睡不着。张思德带领同志们想出很多办法，克服了困难。他处处吃苦在前，享受在后，一贯拣重担子挑。背炭时，别人一次背一包，他却背两包；别人一天最多砍十七、八条树，张思德同志总是砍到二十多条树。和他相处的同志，都说他是赤胆忠心为革命的人。一九四四年九月五日，因炭窑塌下来，他不幸牺牲在炭窑里。毛主席说他这样为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重。像张思德同志这样死比泰山还重的人，还有董存瑞、黄继光、雷锋、王杰、欧阳海等等数不清的革命英雄人物。我们黄山洞也有。像革命烈士古来胜，解放前打游击时，打国民党匪军，勇敢冲锋，为革命牺牲，现在大家还怀念着他，讲他为革命为人民而死，真光荣。的确，革命先烈为了大家的幸福而死，就死得极有价值。如果没有革命先烈的英勇牺牲，就没有我们今天的幸福生活。所以他们的死就比泰山还重。
    比鸿毛还轻的就是少数为地主、国民党反动派、帝国主义当走狗的害人精。像石角村的伪保长李狗仁，解放前带国民党匪军来“剿”黄山洞，抢东西，迫害黄山洞人民。大家恨他入骨，枪毙了他。现在，过了十多年，大家还骂李狗仁是“炮打鬼”、“杀头鬼”。鸡笼山的李福贵，过去也是带蒋匪军屠杀黄山洞人民。今天他死了，大家还在骂他，讲他比死蛇烂蛤还臭，臭几万年。为什么这些坏蛋那么臭？因为他一人作恶，万人受害，满身血腥洗不清。
    所以我们一定要听毛主席的话，向张思德同志学习，做个为革命为人民而生、为革命为人民而死、比泰山还重的人。千万不要做李狗仁、李福贵那类替剥削阶级而死、比鸿毛还轻的坏家伙。
    弄清了为谁生死的问题，就要用毛主席的思想来检查自己过去对人生的看法。上面讲过那种“日求三餐，夜求一宿”、“为自己吃好穿好而生死”的思想，就是错误的。这种人虽然不是为剥削阶级而生死，但同样没有价值。因为这种人自私自利，没有给人民做点好事，死后不值得纪念。如果人人像他们那样，只为自己吃好穿好而生死，那集体就搞不好，甚至会垮台，走回资本主义老路上去。那时就会有人变地主，有人当长工。这样就没有大家的幸福生活了。因此，一定要把这种“日求三餐，夜求一宿”、“为自己吃好穿好”的坏思想挖掉，树立“为人民利益而生死”的思想。
    为人民利益而生死，生时为人民做好事，为革命出力，死了也死得其所，值得大家学习。所以，人生在世要为革命为人民多流一滴汗，才有价值。像对坑生产队的老太婆陈林，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，她八十三岁了，还为队里操心，主动去除花生草等，受人敬重。黄坑生产队五十多岁的保管员田金伯，为社员送粮食，帮病人找医生，半夜三更起来保护耕牛农具，保管队里的稻谷笔笔清楚，人人都称他是一个好管家。我们应该向陈林、田金伯他们学习，做个不怕苦、不怕累，一心为中国革命和世界革命种田的人。不能只看到自己，要看到全世界还有三分之二的人民还没有解放，他们还受压迫、剥削，过着暗无天日的生活。我们要时刻记住毛主席的话，把我国的社会主义革命进行到底，支援世界人民革命，帮助阶级兄弟翻身。平时为中国革命和世界革命耕田，战时为中国革命和世界革命打仗，为革命为人民而生死，做一个比泰山还重的人。
    四、讨论
      （1）一个人要为谁生死才有价值？
      （2）只为自己吃好穿好的思想对不对？这种人的生死有无意义？会走到哪条路上去？有什么危害？
      （3）今后应该做个什么样的人？
    五、小结
    今晚大家讨论得很好。有的说：“不能做自私自利的人，要学习张思德同志一心为革命为人民，生的伟大，死的光荣。”有的说：“要公字当头，才能做个比泰山还重的人！”有的说：“光为个人吃穿劳累，死了也没价值。”有的说：“人一生为吃饭屙屎，无意义。要为革命为集体多流汗，才光荣。”大家讲得很对。今后我们要时时记住毛主席的话，为人民利益而生，为人民利益而死，做个比泰山还重的人。
