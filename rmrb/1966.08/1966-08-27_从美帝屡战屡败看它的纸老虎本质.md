Comrade Mao Zedong said twenty years ago: “When people talk about American imperialism, it seems as if it is incredibly strong. The Chinese reactionaries are using the ‘strength’ of the United States to frighten the Chinese people. However, the American reactionaries will, like all reactionaries in history, be proven to have no real power.” Comrade Mao Zedong often told us that American imperialism is merely a paper tiger.

Looking back at the history of U.S. imperialism's repeated defeats worldwide since the war, and the history of its military strategies continually failing, we can see this clearly.

After the war, the global situation changed significantly. Socialist forces grew much stronger, and national liberation movements flourished. Imperialist forces were weakened to an unprecedented degree. U.S. imperialism replaced the positions of German, Japanese, and Italian fascism, becoming the leader of imperialism and all reactionary forces. On one side is U.S. imperialism, on the other side are the socialist countries, and in between lies a vast intermediate zone. Under these circumstances, U.S. imperialism's military strategy was to prepare for a world war against socialist countries on one hand, and on the other hand, to first invade and control the intermediate zone, especially to suppress the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

However, U.S. imperialism's arrogant military strategy has, from the very beginning, faced the fierce impact of the two great historical tides of socialist revolution and national liberation movements, and has been forced to fail one after another.

In the early post-war period, the Truman administration implemented the so-called “containment” strategy. This strategy aimed to use its then-monopolized atomic weapons as a tool of blackmail, mainly relying on conventional weapons to fight ground wars, seize the intermediate zone, and encircle socialist countries. However, this strategy did not and could not “contain” the revolutionary struggles of the people in various countries. The great victory of the Chinese revolution opened a huge gap in the imperialist front. The victory of the Korean War against the U.S. inflicted the biggest military defeat in U.S. history. The so-called “containment” strategy thus collapsed.

Subsequently, the Eisenhower administration turned to the so-called “massive retaliation” strategy. This strategy focused on developing nuclear weapons and strategic air forces, attempting to use nuclear blackmail to stop the liberation wars of the people in various countries and the support from socialist countries, and actively preparing for nuclear war against socialist countries. However, this strategy was announced and immediately faced a setback in Indochina. Following this, a series of anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles in Asia, Africa, and Latin America achieved victories. The overall global situation underwent a fundamental change of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind. The so-called “massive retaliation” strategy thus reached a dead end.

After Kennedy took office, he began to implement the so-called “flexible response” strategy. This strategy emphasized comprehensive and thorough expansion of the military, requiring the establishment of a “diversified military force” to fight various kinds of wars. While accelerating the preparation for nuclear war and strengthening nuclear blackmail, it significantly expanded the conventional forces for limited and special wars, directing its spearhead first at Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

Kennedy's successor, Johnson, in the process of implementing the “flexible response” strategy, also supplemented it with the “gradual escalation” strategy.

The “gradual escalation” strategy greatly increased the adventurous nature of the “flexible response” strategy. As long as the U.S. deemed it necessary or beneficial, it could arbitrarily create pretexts, make war threats, launch wars, and expand wars. If you show fear, it will become more demanding, with an ever-growing appetite. It also engaged in more frenzied nuclear war blackmail, threatening that if conventional warfare did not achieve its goals, it would escalate to nuclear war.

The “gradual escalation” strategy made U.S. imperialism more deceptive in launching and expanding wars. It used the pretext of “limited objectives” to appear very “restrained,” lulling people into a false sense of security about the war, making it easier for it to escalate the war step by step. When it escalated, it did not do so all at once to the top, but kept a few tricks up its sleeve, maintaining “deterrence” and bait, gradually increasing pressure and luring the opponent into the trap.

The “gradual escalation” strategy fully exposed the weakness of U.S. imperialism. In implementing “war escalation,” it both brandished nuclear weapons to intimidate and added many “safety catches” to the war, especially nuclear war. With every step, it had to look before and after, shout a bit, probe a bit, fearing to go beyond the limit, fearing that the situation would be difficult to control. This is completely the strategy of a gambler who wants to win big but is afraid of losing everything.

During the five years that the Kennedy and Johnson administrations implemented the “flexible response” and “gradual escalation” strategies, they launched more aggressive wars, armed interventions, and military subversion activities than the Truman and Eisenhower administrations combined over sixteen years. But what did the facts of the past five years show? The anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the people in various countries have risen even higher. In Africa and Latin America, guerrilla warfare has ignited in more and more countries. In Asia, especially in Vietnam, no matter how frantically the U.S. imperialists carried out “war escalation” and “bombing to force surrender,” the heroic Vietnamese people not only were not intimidated or subdued but fought even more bravely and strongly, achieving great victories.

Why does U.S. imperialism's military strategy keep changing? It is because it is not doing well, it is repeatedly failing. The result of its changing military strategies is not only that its situation has not improved, but its strategic position has become even weaker and more shaken, it has lost more initiative, and brought about even greater failures. From “containment” to “massive retaliation,” and then from “massive retaliation” to “flexible response,” this is the best proof of U.S. imperialism's repeated defeats worldwide, and the best proof of its deteriorating and declining condition.

Comrade Mao Zedong told us: “All those who claim to be strong reactionaries are merely paper tigers. The reason is that they are detached from the people.” U.S. imperialism's counter-revolutionary global strategy of attempting to dominate the world through force is a reckless strategy that opposes the people of the world. It is doomed to fail. Post-war history has proven that no matter what tricks U.S. imperialism plays in its military strategy, it can all be defeated. It has been defeated, is being defeated, and will be defeated. All peoples who have suffered from U.S. imperialism's aggression, intervention, control, and bullying, as long as they thoroughly dispel the myth of U.S. imperialism's invincibility, see through the paper tiger nature of U.S. imperialism, dare to confront it, and dare to fight it, they will definitely achieve victory.

    从美帝屡战屡败看它的纸老虎本质
    任谷平
    毛泽东同志在二十年前就说过：“提起美国帝国主义，人们似乎觉得它是强大得不得了的，中国的反动派正在拿美国的‘强大’来吓唬中国人民。但是美国反动派也将要同一切历史上的反动派一样，被证明为并没有什么力量。”毛泽东同志经常告诉我们，美帝国主义不过是一只纸老虎。
    回顾一下战后以来美帝国主义在全世界屡战屡败的历史，它的军事战略不断破产的历史，就可以证明这一点。
    战后，世界形势发生了很大的变化。社会主义力量大大增强了，民族解放运动蓬勃发展了，帝国主义力量空前削弱了。美帝国主义代替了德、日、意法西斯的地位，成为帝国主义和一切反动势力的头子。一边是美帝国主义，一边是社会主义国家，中间隔着辽阔的中间地带。在这种形势下，美帝国主义的军事战略是，一方面加紧准备反对社会主义国家的世界战争，一方面首先侵略和控制中间地带，特别是镇压亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族解放运动。
    然而，美帝国主义的这种狂妄的军事战略，从一开始就遇到了汹涌澎湃的社会主义革命和民族解放运动两大历史潮流的猛烈冲击，不能不一个接一个地破产。
    战后初期，杜鲁门政府推行了所谓“遏制”战略。这个战略是，利用它当时垄断的原子武器作为讹诈手段，主要依靠常规武器打地面战争，抢占中间地带，包围社会主义国家。但是，这种战略并没有也不可能“遏制”各国人民革命斗争的发展。中国革命的伟大胜利，在帝国主义战线上打开了一个巨大的缺口。朝鲜抗美战争的胜利，使美帝国主义遭到了它历史上最大的一次军事失败。所谓“遏制”战略，就这样破产了。
    随后，艾森豪威尔政府转而推行所谓“大规模报复”战略。这个战略着重发展核武器和战略空军，企图用核讹诈来阻止各国人民的解放战争和社会主义国家对他们的支援，并积极准备对社会主义国家发动核战争。但是，这个战略刚刚宣布，就在印度支那碰了壁。接着，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的一系列国家的反帝革命斗争取得了胜利。整个世界形势出现了东风压倒西风的根本变化。所谓“大规模报复”战略走到了穷途末路。
    肯尼迪政府上台以后，又开始推行所谓“灵活反应”战略。这个战略，更加强调全面彻底扩军，要求建立一支“多样化的军事力量”，打各种各样的战争。它在加紧准备核战争、加强核讹诈的同时，大大扩充打有限战争和特种战争的常规兵力，把矛头首先指向亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲。
    肯尼迪的继承者约翰逊，在实施“灵活反应”战略的过程中，还用“逐步升级”战略进行了补充。
      “逐步升级”战略，大大增加了“灵活反应”战略的冒险性。只要美国认为需要或者有利，就可以任意制造借口，进行战争威胁，发动战争，扩大战争。如果你表现害怕，它就得寸进尺，胃口越来越大。它还更加疯狂地进行核战争讹诈，叫嚷说如果常规战争达不到目的，它就准备升级到核战争。
    “逐步升级”战略，使得美帝国主义在发动和扩大战争时具有更大的欺骗性。它以“目标有限”为幌子，装出一副很有“克制”的样子，麻痹人们对战争的警觉性，便于它把战争一级一级升上去。当它向上升级时，也不是一下子就升到顶点，而是留几手，保持“威慑”和诱饵，以便逐步增加压力和诱使对方上钩。
      “逐步升级”战略，充分暴露了美帝国主义的虚弱性。在实行“战争升级”时，它既挥舞核武器吓人，又对战争、特别是核战争加上许多“保险栓”。每走一步，都要瞻前顾后，先嚷一阵，试探一阵，害怕越出杠杠，局势不好收拾。这完全是那种既想捞一把又怕输得精光的赌徒的战略。
    肯尼迪和约翰逊政府在推行“灵活反应”和“逐步升级”战略的五年间，发动的侵略战争、武装干涉和军事颠覆活动，超过了杜鲁门政府和艾森豪威尔政府十六年间的总和。可是，五年来的事实说明什么呢？各国人民的反帝革命斗争，有了更大的兴起。在非洲和拉丁美洲，游击战的星星之火在越来越多的国家燃烧起来了。在亚洲，特别是在越南，不管美帝怎样疯狂地搞“战争升级”，“以炸迫和”，英雄的越南人民，不但没有被吓倒，被压服，反而越战越勇，越战越强，取得了伟大胜利。
    美帝国主义的军事战略为什么要一变再变？就是因为它干得很不得手，它不断遭到失败。它更换军事战略的结果，不但没有使它的处境有所改善，反而使它的战略地位更加削弱，更加动摇，使它更加丧失主动权，带来更大的失败。从“遏制”到“大规模报复”，又从“大规模报复”到“灵活反应”，这是美帝国主义在全世界屡战屡败的最好证明，是美帝国主义每况愈下、日益衰落的最好证明。
    毛泽东同志告诉我们：“一切所有号称强大的反动派统统不过是纸老虎。原因是他们脱离人民。”美帝国主义企图依靠武力独霸世界的反革命全球战略，是一个与世界人民为敌的狂妄战略。它是注定要失败的。战后的历史证明，美帝国主义不管在军事战略上变换什么花样，都是完全可以被打败的。它已经被打败，正在被打败，还要被打败。一切遭受美帝国主义侵略、干涉、控制和欺负的人民，只要彻底破除美帝国主义不可战胜的神话，看穿美帝国主义的纸老虎本质，敢于碰它，敢于打它，就一定可以取得胜利。
