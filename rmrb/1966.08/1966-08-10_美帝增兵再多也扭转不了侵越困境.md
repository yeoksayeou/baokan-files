The Democratic Republic of Vietnam's Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly protests against U.S. imperialism's escalation of the war in Vietnam.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on August 9th, condemning the U.S. government's continued dispatch of troops to South Vietnam and the escalation of the war in Vietnam.

The statement said that on August 6th, the U.S. government dispatched another infantry regiment of approximately 3,000 troops to South Vietnam, increasing the number of U.S. troops in Vietnam to 285,000. This newly dispatched force is part of the U.S. 4th Infantry Division planned to be sent to South Vietnam. The statement pointed out that obviously, U.S. imperialism, despite the protests of the peace-loving people of the world, obstinately insists on strengthening its evil war of aggression in Vietnam.

The statement said that up to now, the U.S.'s frenzied actions have not been able to help them reverse the trend of the war and extricate themselves from the predicament in South Vietnam. The U.S.'s dispatch of more troops to South Vietnam, and their intensified bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, including the capital Hanoi, residential areas, economic facilities, and the demilitarized zone, only shows that they are in a position of failure and passivity in South Vietnam.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly condemns and protests against the U.S. government's actions to escalate the war.

The statement pointed out that even if the U.S. aggressors send hundreds of thousands more troops to South Vietnam, they will not be able to shake the iron will of the Vietnamese people to resist the U.S. and save the country. The more the U.S. sends troops, the more the despicable nature of U.S. imperialism's aggression and their deceptive "peace talks" will be exposed, and the greater the losses the U.S. will suffer, which will ultimately lead to their more shameful defeat.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on August 9th, the Vietnamese newspapers "People's Daily" and "People's Army Daily" published editorials on August 8th, enthusiastically praising the glorious victory of the North Vietnamese military and people in shooting down more than 1,300 U.S. aggressor planes, and reaffirming their determination to achieve complete victory.

The editorial of the "People's Daily" said that in just the past three weeks, the North Vietnamese military and people have shot down 100 enemy planes and killed or captured a large number of U.S. aggressor pilots. This is a powerful three weeks of decisive battle and victory in response to Chairman Hu's sacred call to defeat the U.S. aggressors.

The editorial of the "People's Army Daily" said that since July 14th, when the first 1,200 enemy planes were shot down, the North Vietnamese military and people have been shooting down an average of four U.S. planes per day, and since Chairman Hu's historic call on July 17th, they have been shooting down an average of five U.S. planes per day.

The editorial said that the facts of the past three weeks and the past two years have shown that the enemy's every "escalation" of the war cannot intimidate the Vietnamese people, and no deceptive peace talk can make them lose their way. On the contrary, the Vietnamese people have been steadfast from the beginning, aiming at the enemy and fighting resolutely to achieve complete victory.

    越南外交部强烈抗议美帝加紧扩大侵越战争
    美帝增兵再多也扭转不了侵越困境
    北方军民响应胡主席号召以来平均每天击落美机五架
    新华社河内九日电越南民主共和国外交部发言人九日发表声明，谴责美国政府继续向南越增兵，扩大侵越战争。
    声明说，美国政府八月六日又派遣一个步兵旅约三千人在越南南方登陆，使侵越美国远征军的人数增加到二十八万五千人。这支新派遣的军队是美国打算派遣到越南南方的美国第四步兵师的一部分。声明指出，显然，美帝国主义不顾全世界爱好和平人民的抗议，顽固地坚持要加强他们在越南的罪恶侵略战争。
    声明说，到现在为止，美国的疯狂行动并没有能够帮助他们扭转战争的趋势和摆脱在越南南方的困境。美帝国主义向南越增兵，和他们加紧轰炸越南民主共和国，包括首都河内、居民区、经济设施和非军事区等，只能说明他们在越南南方处于失败的地位和被动的处境。
    越南民主共和国外交部强烈谴责和抗议美国政府加剧战争的行动。
    声明指出，美国侵略者即使再派几十万军队到越南南方去，他们也动摇不了越南人民抗美救国的钢铁意志，美国越是增兵，美帝国主义可憎的侵略本性和他们骗人的“和谈”阴谋越是暴露，美国的损失将越重大，这将最后使他们遭到更可耻的失败。
    据新华社河内九日电越南《人民报》和《人民军队报》八日分别发表社论，热烈欢呼越南北方军民总共击落一千三百多架美国强盗飞机的辉煌胜利，并且重申打到彻底胜利的决心。
    越南《人民报》的社论说，仅在最近三周中，越南北方军民就击落了一百架敌机，打死和活捉了一大批美国强盗飞行员。这是越南北方军民响应胡主席战胜美国侵略强盗的神圣号召，决战决胜气势磅礴的三周。
    《人民军队报》的社论说，从七月十四日击落第一千二百架敌机那一天算起，越南北方军民平均每天击落美机四架，而从胡主席七月十七日发出具有历史意义的号召那一天起，平均每天击落美机五架。
    社论说，三周以来，和两年以来的事实表明，敌人的任何一次战争“升级”也吓不倒越南人民，任何欺骗性的和平论调也不能使他们迷失方向。相反，越南人民自始至终都象铜墙铁壁一样坚强，对准敌人打，坚决战斗到彻底胜利。
