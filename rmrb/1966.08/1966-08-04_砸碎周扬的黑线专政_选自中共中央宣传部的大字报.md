Zhou Yang wants to promote his revisionist literary line, and thus must implement a set of organizational lines that involve capitulation and collusion, forming factions and nepotism. He and Lin Mo Han and others have formed a clique, using their authority to vigorously exclude and attack the proletarian revolutionary faction, placing their own confidants in many literary departments, implementing a counter-revolutionary black line dictatorship.

How does Zhou Yang implement his black line dictatorship?

First, he extensively promotes the big shots of the literary black line from the 1930s, usurping the Party's leadership. Since the founding of the nation, Zhou Yang, under the guise of "uniting old writers and strengthening the leadership of literary work," has placed Xia Yan, Tian Han, Yang Han Sheng, and Shao Yuan Lin, the big shots of the literary black line from the 1930s, in leadership positions in the Ministry of Culture and various literary federations. He lets them control the Party's power. Zhou Yang knows full well that Tian Han and Yang Han Sheng are not suitable for Party leadership work, but he plays a counter-revolutionary two-faced game, deceiving superiors and subordinates, secretly appointing officials, and misusing the name of the Central Propaganda Department to have Tian Han and Yang Han Sheng take on the positions of Party branch secretaries of the Drama Federation and the Federation of Literary and Art Circles. The Drama Federation and the Federation of Literary and Art Circles have been controlled by these two "black secretaries" for more than a decade, becoming strongholds against the Party and socialism.

The group that Zhou Yang relies on and promotes, Xia Yan, Tian Han, Yang Han Sheng, and Shao Yuan Lin, have never been proletarian revolutionaries from the 1930s to the 1960s. They hang the golden sign of "old Party members" and "old leftists," but in reality, they are a typical group of representatives of the bourgeoisie. Their ugly history during the democratic revolution period is not mentioned, and after entering the socialist revolution, they not only do not revolutionize themselves but also do not allow others to revolutionize; not only do they not advance but also try to reverse the wheel of history. Every step of the socialist revolution encounters their resistance. They harbor deep hatred for the Party, socialism, and proletarian dictatorship. The two major attacks on the literary front by the bourgeoisie against the Party and socialism in 1957 and during the three years of economic difficulties were the result of the counter-revolutionary revisionist black gang led by Zhou Yang.

For this reason, when Chairman Mao severely criticized literary work in 1964, Zhou Yang felt that if he did not sacrifice a few horses and carriages, the root of his black line would be exposed, and he, as the head of the black line, would be in danger. Thus, he employed counter-revolutionary two-faced tactics and conducted a fake rectification movement in the literary circle. At the meeting, Zhou Yang pretended to criticize Xia Yan, Tian Han, and Yang Han Sheng, but secretly comforted them afterwards. When publicly criticizing in the newspapers, Zhou Yang formulated many rules and regulations to restrict the hands and feet of the leftists, trying every means to let these black gang leaders seize the opportunity to return to power. Zhou Yang's intentions were revealed at a meeting he convened for non-Party writers and artists. He said: "As long as they correct their mistakes, they can still manage literary work." This fully illustrates the unusual relationship between them, completely a counter-revolutionary revisionist black gang clique; at the same time, it also shows that they are not willing to withdraw from the literary front and that the leadership of proletarian literature cannot be seized without a serious struggle.

Second, Zhou Yang recruits Party discontented elements to act as anti-Party lackeys. From his bourgeois standpoint, Zhou Yang has special feelings for those who have made serious political mistakes within the Party, often using the despicable method of promising official positions to buy them off and win them over as his followers. Here are just two examples:

Yuan Wen Shu, in 1959, was criticized in Shanghai for making serious political mistakes. However, Zhou Yang and Lin Mo Han showed concern and trust for him, transferring him to Beijing and placing him in the Film Workers' Association, where he, along with Xia Yan and Chen Huang Mei, controlled the Film Association, actively advocating and executing Zhou Yang's revisionist literary line, and engaging in anti-Party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought criminal activities in the film industry. After 1964, Yuan Wen Shu, under Zhou Yang's extensive protection, replaced Xia Yan and Chen Huang Mei and actually took charge of the work of the Film Association, continuing to control the propaganda front of the film industry.

Another example is a writer from Hubei who, in 1959, was criticized for writing anti-Party works and advocating revisionist literary theory. However, because he was a vanguard in opposing Party leadership and fanning the "reversal wind," he was "appreciated" by Zhou Yang and Lin Mo Han, transferred from Hubei to Beijing, promoted, and given a leadership position, working with Tian Han to implement bourgeois dictatorship in the Drama Federation.

Third, Zhou Yang surrenders and protects traitors and hooligans. To expand his anti-Party, anti-socialist forces, Zhou Yang actively engages in surrender and recruitment activities among traitors, hooligans, rightists, and other reactionary literati, politically protecting those who surrender to him, arranging their work, and taking care of their lives in every way.

Zhou Zuo Ren is a notorious traitorous literatus who served as the "Director of Education for North China" under the Japanese puppet government and as a "Member of the National Government" under the Wang Jing Wei puppet regime. Chairman Mao, in his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," severely criticized him: "Literature is for the imperialists, people like Zhou Zuo Ren and Zhang Zi Ping are like this, this is called traitorous literature." However, Zhou Yang shamelessly beautifies this traitorous literatus, saying he "has never opposed communism." Zhou Zuo Ren, upon hearing this, immediately wrote a letter to Zhou Yang saying, "I am very grateful," to express his gratitude. Not only that, but Zhou Yang also specially took care of his life, using the method of advance manuscript fees to have the working people support him. Zhou Yang even abused his power, letting the Federation of Literary and Art Circles send cadres to accompany Zhou Zuo Ren on trips, and gave Zhou Zuo Ren a stack of letterhead stamped with Zhou Yang's personal seal, allowing Zhou Zuo Ren to fill it out at will, going wherever he wanted. These facts show that Zhou Yang has degenerated into a thorough counter-revolutionary who speaks for the enemy and serves the enemy.

Kong Jue is Zhou Yang's favorite student, who was expelled from the Party and subjected to legal punishment due to moral degradation, lifestyle corruption, and repeated offenses. The broad masses and revolutionary literary workers all applauded the government's wise decision. However, Zhou Yang doted on this hooligan, in 1958, using every means to help him get an early release, and by 1963, secretly placed him in the Rural Reading Materials Publishing House as an editor.

These big shots of the literary black line from the 1930s, untransformed bourgeois intellectuals, traitors, hooligans, and so on, are the main members and lackeys of Zhou Yang's counter-revolutionary black gang. They are the big and small ghosts and snakes in the literary world, representing the reactionary clique of the overthrown landlord class and bourgeoisie. They have been entrenched in the literary world for a long time, spreading many fallacies, and the poison is widespread. We must thoroughly smash this black gang, eliminate this black line, and seize back all the literary fronts they have occupied!

    砸碎周扬的黑线专政
    ——选自中共中央宣传部的大字报
    周扬要推行他的修正主义文艺路线，就必然要实行一套招降纳叛、结党营私的组织路线。他和林默涵等人结成一伙，利用职权，竭力排斥和打击无产阶级革命派，安插自己的亲信，把持了许多文艺部门，实行反革命的黑线专政。
    周扬是怎样实行他的黑线专政的呢？
    一，大量起用三十年代文艺黑线的大将，篡夺党的领导权。建国以来，周扬以“团结老作家、加强文艺工作领导”为名，把夏衍、田汉、阳翰笙、邵荃麟等三十年代文艺黑线的大将，安插在文化部、文联各协会的领导岗位，让他们把持党的大权。周扬明知道田汉、阳翰笙不适合做党的领导工作，就玩弄反革命的两面手法，瞒上欺下，私自封官，盗用中央宣传部的名义，叫田汉和阳翰笙担任剧协和文联党组书记的职务。剧协和文联，就由这两个“黑书记”专了十几年政，成了反党反社会主义的阵地。
    周扬所依靠、所重用的夏衍、田汉、阳翰笙、邵荃麟这批人，从三十年代到六十年代，从来都不是无产阶级的革命派。他们挂着“老党员”、“老左翼”的金字招牌，实际上是一群典型的资产阶级代表人物。他们在民主革命时期的丑恶历史且不说，进入社会主义革命之后，他们不但自己不革命，还不准别人革命；不但自己不前进，还企图让历史的车轮倒转。社会主义革命每深入一步，都遭到他们的抵抗。他们对党、对社会主义、对无产阶级专政怀有无比的仇恨。一九五七年和三年经济困难时期，文艺战线上资产阶级向党向社会主义的两次大进攻，就是周扬这伙反革命修正主义黑帮兴妖作怪的结果。
    正因为这样，当毛主席在一九六四年对文艺工作提出严厉批评的时候，周扬感到如果不舍几个车马，以他为代表的黑线根子就要败露了，他这个黑线总头目就要自身难保了。于是，他施展反革命的两面手法，在文艺界搞了一个假整风。在会上，周扬装模作样地对夏衍、田汉、阳翰笙等人进行“批判”，会后又暗中给他们许多抚慰。在报上公开批判时，周扬制定许多清规戒律，束缚左派手脚，想方设法让这些黑帮大将伺机重新上台。周扬这番“用心”，在他召集的非党作家艺术家的会议上，曾经公开表露过。他说：“只要他们改正了错误，还是可以再管文艺工作的。”这就充分说明他们之间的关系非同寻常，完全是一伙反革命修正主义的黑帮集团；同时，也说明他们是不甘心退出文艺阵地的，不经过严重的斗争，无产阶级文艺的领导权是夺不过来的。
    二，网罗对党不满分子，充当反党的走卒。周扬从他的资产阶级立场出发，对于那些在党内犯有严重政治错误的人，有着特殊的感情，常常用封官许愿的卑鄙手段，收买他们，拉拢他们，作为自己的党羽。这里只举两例：
    袁文殊，一九五九年在上海因犯严重的政治错误受到批评。周扬和林默涵却对他表示关怀和信任，把他调到北京来，安插在电影工作者协会，同夏衍、陈荒煤一起，把持着电影协会，积极鼓吹和执行周扬的修正主义文艺路线，在电影界进行反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪恶活动。一九六四年以后，袁文殊又在周扬百般庇护下，代替夏衍、陈荒煤，实际上主持电影协会的工作，继续控制电影工作的宣传阵地。
    又如湖北的一个作家，一九五九年因为写反党作品和鼓吹修正主义文艺理论而受到批判。但是，由于他是反对党的领导、大刮“翻案风”的急先锋，受到周扬和林默涵的“赏识”，从湖北调到北京来，升了官，担负领导工作，同田汉结合在一起，在剧协实行资产阶级专政。
    三，招降纳叛，庇护汉奸、流氓。周扬为了扩大他的反党反社会主义的队伍，还积极在汉奸、流氓、右派等反动文人中，进行招降纳叛的活动，凡是投靠他的，就在政治上加以庇护，工作上给予安排，生活上百般照顾。
    周作人是臭名昭著的汉奸文人，他当过日伪的“华北教育总监”，当过汪精卫伪政权的“国府委员”。毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中，曾对他痛加斥责：“文艺是为帝国主义者的，周作人、张资平这批人就是这样，这叫做汉奸文艺”。但是，周扬却无耻地美化这个汉奸文人，说他“从来不曾反对过共产主义”。周作人听了之后，立即写信给周扬说：“闻之甚为幸慰”，以示感恩。不仅如此，周扬还在生活上给他特殊的照顾，用预支高稿酬的办法让劳动人民供养他。周扬甚至还滥用职权，让文联派干部陪同周作人外出旅行，并将一叠盖上周扬私章的信笺交给周作人，由周作人随意填写，愿意到哪里，就到哪里。这些事实说明，周扬已经堕落为一个彻头彻尾的帮敌人讲话、替敌人服务的反革命分子。
    孔厥是周扬的得意门生，因为道德败坏，生活腐化，屡教不改，被开除党籍，并受到法律的制裁。广大群众和革命文艺工作者对于人民政府的这一英明决定，无不拍手称快。周扬对这个流氓成性的人却宠爱备至，一九五八年，想方设法帮他捞到提前释放，到一九六三年，又私自把他安插在农村读物出版社当编辑。
    这些三十年代文艺黑线的大将，没有经过改造的资产阶级知识分子以及汉奸、流氓等等，就是周扬这个反革命黑帮的主要成员和走卒。他们是文艺界大大小小的牛鬼蛇神，是代表被推翻了的地主阶级和资产阶级利益的反动集团。他们盘踞在文艺界的时间很长，散布的谬论很多，流毒甚广。我们一定要彻底粉碎这个黑帮，搞掉这条黑线，夺回被他们霸占的一切文艺阵地！
