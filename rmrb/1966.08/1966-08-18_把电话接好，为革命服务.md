Most, most beloved Party Central Committee,
Most, most beloved Chairman Mao:

We resolutely and enthusiastically support the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee. Every sentence in the communiqué shines with the brilliant light of great Mao Zedong Thought. It is the great blueprint for building our country into a socialist power, and the guiding light for all Chinese people and all the people of the world towards communism.

The Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee emphasized: "The whole Party and the whole country studying the works of Comrade Mao Zedong is a major event of historic significance. Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time." From our class's practice, we deeply feel that this is an absolute truth. Our class has thirty comrades, most of whom come from impoverished families, born in the old society and raised under the red flag. Over the past two years, we have persisted in studying Chairman Mao's works, and the spiritual and productive faces of the entire class have undergone great changes. Things we used to be afraid to do, we now dare to do; things we used to be unwilling to do, we now willingly do. This shows that wherever Mao Zedong Thought shines, there is light; wherever Chairman Mao's words are applied, things can be done well.

Chairman Mao's books have liberated our minds, making us leap from our original small world of individualism to the great world of global revolution. Sitting in the control room, we see all of China and the world. We realize that every call we connect daily is closely linked to the world revolution. We feel proud that we can serve the Chinese people and the people of the world in our ordinary work positions.

During this Cultural Revolution, we considered that the work of telephone operators, who have long been engaged in indoor labor, differs greatly from the labor of workers and peasants. To better reform our thinking, we proactively linked up with suburban agricultural production teams and participated in physical labor. We labored with the peasant comrades with the purpose of reforming our thinking. We also used our evenings to work as service staff in some hotels. Through these activities, we strengthened our class feelings with the working people. In the future, we will resolutely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, listen to Chairman Mao's words, care about state affairs, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

Let us shout:

Long live the Communist Party of China!
Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!

　　把电话接好，为革命服务最最敬爱的党中央最最敬爱的毛主席：
    我们最坚决最热烈地拥护党的八届十一中全会公报。公报的每一句话都闪耀着伟大毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉，它是把我国建设成为社会主义强国的伟大纲领，是全中国人民和全世界人民通向共产主义的指路明灯。
    八届十一中全会强调指出：“全党全国大学毛泽东同志著作，是一个具有历史意义的重大事件。毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。”从我们这个班的实践，我们深深地体会到这是千真万确的真理。我们这个班共有三十个同志，大多数都是出身在贫苦家庭的穷孩子，生在旧社会，长在红旗下。两年来，我们坚持学习了毛主席著作，全班的精神面貌和生产面貌都发生了很大的变化。过去怕做的事情，现在敢做了，过去不愿意做的事情，现在乐意做了。这说明了毛泽东思想照到那里，那里就亮，毛主席的话，用到那里，那里就能办好事情。
    毛主席的书，解放我们的思想，使我们从原来只为个人的小天地，跃进到世界革命的大天地，坐在机房里，看到全中国、全世界。我们认识到，自己每天所接续的千百个电话，都同世界革命有着紧密的联系。我们以自己能够在平凡的工作岗位上，为中国人民世界人民服务而感到自豪。
    在这次文化大革命中，我们考虑到话务员的工作，长期在室内劳动，与工人、农民的劳动有很大差别。为了更好地改造我们的思想，我们主动与市郊农业生产队挂钩，参加体力劳动。我们带着改造思想的目的和农民兄弟一起劳动，我们还利用晚上的业余时间到一些旅店当服务员。通过这些活动，增强劳动人民的阶级感情。今后，我们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，听毛主席的话，关心国家大事，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    让我们高呼：
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！万万岁！
