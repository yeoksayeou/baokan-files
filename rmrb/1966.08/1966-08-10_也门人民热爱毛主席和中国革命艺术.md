Not long ago, the Chinese Folk Dance Troupe, carrying the deep affection of 700 million Chinese people, arrived in the Arab Republic of Yemen on the shores of the Red Sea. From June 21 to July 17, they performed 22 shows in various parts of Yemen, receiving a warm welcome from the Yemeni people. The audience reached 100,000 people. During the troupe's visit and performances, the broad masses of the Yemeni people expressed their love for Chairman Mao Zedong and their ardent feelings for Chinese revolutionary art in various ways.

During the troupe's visit, no matter which performance, as soon as they heard the familiar name of Chairman Mao, the audience would erupt in thunderous applause. After a performance in Taiz, a spectator named Rahman excitedly shouted "Long live Mao Zedong!" towards the stage. He told his Chinese friends: "I love Mao Zedong because Mao Zedong is the leader of the world's revolutionary people." In Yemen, such enthusiastic words could be heard everywhere: "Chairman Mao is the greatest leader of our time," "Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of the world's people," "Chairman Mao is the leader of all people who seek liberation," "Wishing Chairman Mao Zedong eternal life."

Many spectators shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" after watching the dance "Ode to the Oil Workers." A Yemeni friend named Muhammad Aliji said: "The Chinese people can create miracles because they have the leadership of the wise leader Mao Zedong." Another Yemeni friend said: "Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, the Chinese people's progress relies on Mao Zedong." A student named Ali Haifi said: "Under the leadership of Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have set an example for the struggle of the world's people."

Many Yemeni friends felt proud to have a badge with Mao Zedong's image, considering it the most meaningful souvenir. A Yemeni friend named Abdul Ali Saeed, upon receiving a badge with Chairman Mao's image, happily said: "This is a great symbol, I will wear it forever."

Many people, after watching the performances, asked Chinese friends for "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." They said that the performances by the Chinese Folk Dance Troupe had given them a deep understanding of Mao Zedong Thought. What they needed now was to read Chairman Mao's books.

The Yemeni people highly praised Chinese revolutionary art guided by Mao Zedong Thought. A spectator said, "The performances by the Chinese Folk Dance Troupe embody Mao Zedong Thought," "The performances by the Chinese Dance Troupe are a very good gift to the Yemeni people."

Almost all spectators, after watching the performances, praised them highly, saying: "Chinese art is excellent, it inspires and educates people."

A worker said: "I like songs that depict struggle and praise revolution. They inspire people to move forward." A man named Salam Muhammad from South Yemen said: "The performances by the Chinese Dance Troupe greatly boosted our fighting spirit against imperialism." A spectator named Muhammad said: "The broad masses of the Yemeni people love Chinese dance because it depicts patriotism, depicts struggle, depicts revolution, it inspires us to move forward, makes us stand tall, and see far."

Countless people traveled from distant villages to cities to watch the performances. Some followed from Sana'a to Taiz, watching performance after performance. On the morning of July 2, a group of women traveled from a distant village to Ib. When they heard that the performance had ended, many were disappointed and shed tears. Upon hearing this news, the Chinese artists immediately performed a special show for them. The women were deeply moved, reluctantly holding the hands of the female performers.

Many Yemeni friends said that the Yemeni people love Chinese art and even more love the Chinese people. A Yemeni friend named Qaqisi said, "Chinese art is the best art in the world, the Chinese people are the greatest people in the world, they are the vanguard of the anti-imperialist struggle."

To better express the affection of the Chinese people for the Yemeni people, the Chinese artists, despite the fatigue of travel, upon arriving in Yemen, immediately learned Yemeni folk dances from Yemeni artists. During their performances, whenever the Chinese singers sang the Yemeni song "My Homeland," the stage and the audience formed a huge chorus of Sino-Yemeni people. Once, a spectator named Anisi excitedly said: "When I sing this song with Chinese friends, I deeply feel that the Sino-Yemeni people's hearts are connected." The Yemeni friends accompanying the Chinese Dance Troupe also learned to sing "The East Is Red" in Chinese. As a Yemeni friend said: "The visit and performances by the Chinese Folk Dance Troupe are not just ordinary performances, this is an exchange of deep affection between the peoples of the two countries."

On July 2, the Chinese Dance Troupe traveled from Ib to Taiz, passing through the scenic area of Jibna. When the Chinese performers were about to climb the mountain for a distant view, more than 700 men, women, and children from the mountain city came down to warmly welcome the troupe. The Chinese artists immediately performed for them on a grassy slope. Instantly, applause and cheers echoed through the valley. The people here said that this ancient mountain city had, for the first time, seen foreign friends travel thousands of miles to perform for them. When the Chinese performers danced the Yemeni folk dance, the Yemeni friends couldn't help but wave their swords and dance with the Chinese friends, the more they danced, the more people joined. A natural friendship festival between the Sino-Yemeni peoples brought joy to this ancient city.

The short visit and performances by the Chinese Folk Dance Troupe in Yemen left a deep impression on the Yemeni people. The friendship between the two peoples, as said by Muhammad Zabi, the deputy director of the Sana'a Textile Factory built with Chinese aid: "It will last as long as the Yangtze River in China!"

### 也门人民热爱毛主席和中国革命艺术

    也门人民热爱毛主席和中国革命艺术
    不久以前，中国民间歌舞团带着七亿中国人民的深情厚谊来到红海之滨的阿拉伯也门共和国。从六月二十一日到七月十七日，他们在也门各地共演出二十二场，受到也门人民的热烈欢迎，观众达十万人次。在歌舞团访问演出期间，也门广大人民用各种方式表达了他们对毛泽东主席的热爱以及对体现毛泽东思想的中国革命艺术的热烈感情。
    在歌舞团访问期间，无论那一场演出，只要一听到毛主席这亲切的名字，观众就响起暴风雨般的掌声。在塔伊兹的一次演出结束后，一位名叫拉赫曼的观众激动地朝着台上连声高呼“毛泽东万岁！”他告诉中国朋友：“我热爱毛泽东，因为毛泽东是世界革命人民的领袖。”在也门，到处都可以听到这样热情洋溢的话：“毛主席是当代最伟大的领袖”，“毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，也是世界人民的伟大领袖”，“毛主席是所有要求解放的人民的领袖”，“祝毛泽东主席万寿无疆”。
    许多观众在看过舞蹈《石油工人凯歌》之后，高呼“毛主席万岁！”一位名叫穆罕默德·阿里吉的也门朋友说：“中国人民能成为奇迹的创造者，就是因为他们有英明领袖毛泽东的领导。”另一位也门朋友说：“大海航行靠舵手，中国人民前进靠毛泽东。”有一位名叫阿里·海菲的学生说：“在毛泽东领导下的中国人民为世界人民的斗争树立了榜样。”
    许多也门朋友都以能有一枚刻有毛泽东象的纪念章而感到自豪，他们认为这是最有意义的纪念品。一位名叫阿卜杜·阿里·赛义德的也门朋友在得到一枚毛主席象的纪念章时，高兴地说：这是伟大的象征，我要永远戴着它。
    还有好多人，看了演出之后，向中国朋友要《毛泽东选集》。他们说，中国民间歌舞团的演出，使他们对毛泽东思想有很深的体会。他们现在需要的是读毛主席的书。
    也门人民高度赞扬以毛泽东思想为指导的中国革命文艺。一位观众说，“中国民间歌舞团演出的节目体现了毛泽东思想”，“中国歌舞团的演出是给也门人民的一件很好的礼物”。
    几乎所有的观众在看完演出后，都赞不绝口地说：中国艺术太好了，它使人们受到鼓舞，受到教育。
    一位工人说：“我喜欢表现斗争和歌颂革命的歌曲。它鼓舞着人们前进。”一位来自南也门的萨拉姆·穆罕默德说：中国歌舞团的演出“大大地鼓舞了我们反对帝国主义的斗志。”一位名叫穆罕默德的观众说：“广大也门人民喜爱中国歌舞，是因为它表现了爱国，表现了战斗，表现了革命，它鼓舞着我们前进，使我们站得高，看得远。”
    不知多少群众，从遥远的乡下赶到城市，有的人从萨那一直跟到塔伊兹，一场又一场地观看演出。七月二日早上，一群妇女从很远的村庄赶到伊卜，当她们听说演出已经结束了，许多人惋惜得流了泪。中国艺术家们一听到这个消息，马上为她们专场演出。妇女们感动极了，依依不舍地紧紧地握着女演员们的手。
    许多也门朋友说，也门人民喜欢中国艺术，更热爱中国人民。一位名叫卡基西的也门朋友说，“中国艺术是世界上最好的艺术，中国人民是世界上最伟大的人民，是反帝斗争的先锋队。”
    中国艺术家们为了更好地表达中国人民对也门人民亲切的情谊，他们不顾旅途疲劳，刚刚到达也门，就向也门艺术家们学习也门民间歌舞。在他们演出期间，每当中国歌唱家演唱也门歌曲《我的祖国》时，台上台下就形成一支中也人民巨大的合唱队。有一次，一位名叫安尼西的观众激动地说：“当我同中国朋友一起唱这支歌曲时，我深深感到中也人民心连心”。陪同中国歌舞团的也门朋友们也学会了用中国话唱《东方红》。正如一位也门朋友所说的：“中国民间歌舞团的访问演出不是一般的演出，这是中也两国人民深情厚谊的交流。”
    七月二日，中国歌舞团从伊卜前往塔伊兹路过风景区吉布纳参观。当中国演员们将要登山远眺时，这个山城的七百多男女老少从山上下来，热情地欢迎歌舞团。中国艺术家们立即在山坡的一块草坪上为他们演出。顿时，掌声和叫好声响彻了山谷。这里的人们说，这个古老的山城破天荒第一次看到外国朋友不远万里而来为他们演出。当中国演员们跳起也门民间舞蹈时，也门朋友情不自禁地挥舞着腰刀同中国朋友们一起翩翩起舞，越跳人越多。一个自然结合的中也人民友谊大联欢，给这古老的山城带来了一片欢腾。
    中国民间歌舞团在也门短短的访问演出，给也门人民留下了深刻的印象。中也两国人民这种友谊，正象中国援助也门修建的萨那纺织厂副厂长穆罕默德·扎比卜讲的：“它将象中国的长江一样与世永存！”
