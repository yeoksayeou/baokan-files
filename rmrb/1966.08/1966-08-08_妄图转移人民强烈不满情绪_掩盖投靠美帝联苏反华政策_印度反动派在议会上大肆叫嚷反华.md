The Indian reactionary clique, which is facing increasing difficulties at home and unprecedented isolation internationally, raised its voice to shout anti-China slogans during the parliamentary session that began on July 25. It attempted to divert the people's strong discontent and cover up its reactionary policy of aligning with US imperialism, colluding with Soviet revisionism, and opposing China.

This parliamentary session was opened amidst chaos, with the opposition party using the people's discontent to propose a motion of no confidence against the Congress Party government. In the past few days, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, Foreign Minister Swaran Singh, and Defense Minister Chavan have been continuously shouting anti-China slogans. The reactionary newspapers in New Delhi have also been cooperating in the propaganda.

In this round of anti-China shouting, Indira Gandhi's voice was the loudest. Apart from continuing to talk about the so-called "Chinese threat," she even resorted to her father Nehru's lies, slandering China as "imperialism." On July 25, Indira Gandhi said that during her recent overseas trip, she discussed the issue of "danger from China" with Soviet and Yugoslav leaders. She also said that the joint statement between India and the Soviet Union mentioned that the imperialist and reactionary forces that increase the danger of war are not referring to the United States but to "China and the old colonialist countries." This once again exposed the despicable conspiracy of US imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and the Indian reactionary clique to jointly oppose China.

Foreign Minister Swaran Singh, in his parliamentary response, accused China of continuing to be hostile towards India. Therefore, the Indian government believes that there is no room for further exploration on the issue of the Sino-Indian border dispute.

Defense Minister Chavan stated on August 2 that the Indian government has taken military measures in the Kashmir region and Sikkim, both of which are under Indian occupation. At the same time, he fabricated lies out of thin air, saying that Chinese troops are "continuing to gather" at the border.

Some members of the Congress Party also echoed in the parliament, saying that the price increases caused by the government's military expansion and preparation are the "result of Chinese aggression." They even shouted that because the Democratic Republic of Vietnam did not support the Indian government's reactionary position during the armed conflict on the Sino-Indian border, "India should not now say that the United States is invading Vietnam." They attempted to use this to justify their position of acting as a lackey for US imperialism on the Vietnam issue.

The Indian government's reactionary policy of aligning with the US and the Soviet Union to oppose China has led to unprecedented isolation internationally. Domestically, there is a severe grain shortage, soaring prices, growing people's discontent, and the opposition party is using the people's discontent to gain political capital. The Congress Party is also in disarray, creating a chaotic situation. All these issues cannot be covered up by the Indian reactionary ruling clique's anti-China shouting.

According to reports, during the parliamentary session, angry crowds continuously demonstrated in front of the parliament and near the prime minister's residence. On July 26, 5,000 federal government employees, despite the police's brutal suppression, rushed to Indira Gandhi's residence to demonstrate. They shouted, "Let us overthrow this incompetent government!" "Indira Gandhi does not care about the people's suffering at all!" At the same time, the parliament was in chaos. During this session, four people were suspended from their parliamentary seats, and two others were expelled from the parliament. Even Western news agencies admitted that "this is the most chaotic scene seen in the Indian parliament since its establishment."

### 妄图转移人民强烈不满情绪　掩盖投靠美帝联苏反华政策  印度反动派在议会上大肆叫嚷反华

    妄图转移人民强烈不满情绪　掩盖投靠美帝联苏反华政策
    印度反动派在议会上大肆叫嚷反华
    新华社七日讯　新德里消息：在国内遭到越来越大困难、在国际上陷于空前孤立的印度统治集团，在七月二十五日开始的议会会议上，提高嗓门叫嚷反华，妄图转移人民的强烈不满，掩盖它们投靠美帝、联苏反华的反动政策。
    这次议会会议是在反对党利用人民的不满情绪，对国大党政府提出不信任案，互相吵吵嚷嚷，一片混乱中开幕的。连日来，印度总理英迪拉·甘地夫人、外交部长辛格、国防部长恰范等不断发出反华叫嚣，新德里的反动报纸也配合宣传。
    这次反华叫嚷中，英迪拉·甘地夫人调门最高。她除了继续大谈所谓“中国威胁”之外，竟然又搬出她的父亲尼赫鲁的谰言，诬蔑中国是“帝国主义”。英迪拉·甘地夫人七月二十五日说，她最近出国期间，和苏联、南斯拉夫领导人讨论了“来自中国的危险”问题，并且说印苏联合公报中提到的引起战争危险增长的帝国主义和反动势力，不是指美国，而是指“中国和老殖民主义国家”。这恰恰再一次暴露了美帝国主义、苏联修正主义和印度反动派联合反华的卑鄙阴谋。
    外交部长辛格在议会答辩中反咬中国一口说，中国继续敌视印度，因此，印度政府认为，关于中印边界争端，“在谈判问题上没有进一步试探的余地。”
    国防部长恰范八月二日表示，印度政府已经在印度占领的克什米尔地区和锡金采取了军事措施。同时，他又凭空捏造谎言说，中国部队在边境“继续集结”。
    国大党的一些议员们也在议会里随声附和，说什么印度政府扩军备战引起的物价上涨，是“中国侵略的结果”。他们甚至叫嚷：由于越南民主共和国在中印边境武装冲突中没有支持印度政府的反动立场，现在“印度也不应该说美国对越南进行侵略”，妄图以此为其在越南问题上充当美帝国主义帮凶的立场辩解。
    印度政府奉行亲美联苏反华的反动政策，在国际上空前孤立。在国内，粮荒严重，物价飞涨，人民不满增长，反对党利用人民的不满情绪捞取政治资本，国大党内部也四分五裂，一片乌烟瘴气。所有这些都是印度反动当权派叫嚣反华所掩盖不了的。
    据报道，议会开会期间，愤怒的群众不断在议会门前和印度总理住宅附近举行示威。七月二十六日，五千名联邦政府职员，不顾警察的残暴镇压，涌向英迪拉·甘地夫人的住宅示威，他们高呼：“让我们推翻这个无能的政府！”
  “英迪拉·甘地根本不关心人民痛苦！”同时，议会内部也吵吵嚷嚷，乱作一团。这次会议期间，有四人被停止议员资格，另外两人被赶出议会。连西方通讯社也承认，“这是印度议会成立以来人们看到的一次最狂乱的情景。”
