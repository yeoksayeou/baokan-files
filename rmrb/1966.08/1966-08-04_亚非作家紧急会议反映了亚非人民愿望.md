Deputy Secretary-General Deshpriya Senanayake Holds a Reception in Shanghai

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 3rd: Deputy Secretary-General of the Permanent Bureau of Asian and African Writers, Deshpriya Senanayake, and his wife held a reception today to entertain representatives from various countries and regions attending the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers.

Shanghai Vice Mayor Liang Guobin and his wife, Vice Mayors Zhang Chengzong and Jin Zhonghua, as well as leaders from various relevant departments in Shanghai, cultural workers, and advanced figures from various fronts were invited to attend the reception.

At the reception, Senanayake spoke. In the name of the Deputy Secretary-General of the Permanent Bureau of Asian and African Writers, he expressed heartfelt thanks to all Asian and African writers and to the Chinese friends who assisted during the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers. He also expressed his good wishes to the Asian and African writers who were about to return home.

He said, the resolutions and decisions made at the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers sincerely reflect the aspirations of the Asian and African peoples. These resolutions and decisions are powerful weapons for us to defeat the splitters, revisionists, imperialists, and reactionaries. I appeal to all Asian and African writers present to convey the content expressed in the conference resolutions to the writers and people of their own countries from now on, and to bring more revolutionary writers back to Beijing when the Third Asian and African Writers Conference is held.

He once again strongly condemned the activities of Soviet revisionists in splitting the Asian and African writers' movement. He said, it is heard that the splitters will meet in Baku this month. Such a meeting cannot be called a conference; it is just a conspiracy against the Asian and African writers and peoples. We will definitely win because we stand on the side of the people; they will definitely fail because they stand on the side of imperialism. Finally, he raised his glass and proposed a toast for the Asian and African writers to meet again at the next conference.

Vice Mayor Liang Guobin made a toast at the reception. He thanked Senanayake and the representatives for their enthusiastic visit to Shanghai, highly praised the achievements of Shanghai's socialist revolution and socialist construction under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and highly evaluated the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said, this is a great encouragement to the people of Shanghai.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 3rd: Some representatives attending the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers departed from Shanghai by plane tonight. Tonight, more than a thousand people from various circles in Shanghai went to the airport to see off the Asian and African friends. When the foreign friends arrived at the airport, the people who came to see them off waved bouquets and ribbons, beat drums, and the Young Pioneers presented flowers. The people who came to see them off repeatedly shouted, "Long live the unity of Asian and African writers!" "Long live the unity of the peoples of the world!" The Asian and African friends repeatedly shook hands, embraced, and bid farewell, wishing each other new contributions in the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggle on their respective battlefields.

The deputy leader of the Chinese delegation to the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers, Liu Baiyu, and some members of the delegation went to the airport to see them off. Leaders from relevant departments in Shanghai, such as Meng Bo, Ba Jin, Feng Guozhu, Zhang Zhenya, and the writer Lu Mang, also went to the airport to see them off.

Tonight, some foreign friends who came to Shanghai to attend the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers also went to the airport to see them off.

    森纳那亚克秘书长在上海举行的招待会上说
    亚非作家紧急会议反映了亚非人民愿望
    上海各界千余人热烈欢送部分亚非作家回国
    据新华社上海三日电　亚非作家常设局秘书长德希普里耶·森纳那亚克和夫人今天举行招待会，招待出席亚非作家紧急会议的各个国家和地区的代表。
    上海市副市长梁国斌和夫人，副市长张承宗、金仲华以及上海市各有关方面负责人、文艺工作者和各条战线上的先进人物应邀出席了招待会。
    在招待会上，森纳那亚克讲话。他以亚非作家常设局秘书长的名义，向所有亚非作家、向亚非作家紧急会议召开期间帮助工作的中国朋友表示衷心感谢。并对即将回国的亚非作家表示欢送。
    他说，在亚非作家紧急会议上作出的决议、决定，真诚地反映了亚非人民的愿望，这些决议、决定是我们战胜分裂主义者、修正主义者、帝国主义、反动派的强有力的武器。我向所有在座的亚非作家们呼吁，从现在起，将会议决议所表达的内容向自己国家的作家和人民传达，并在第三届亚非作家大会召开时，伴同更多的革命作家重新来到北京。
    他再次严厉谴责苏联修正主义者分裂亚非作家运动的活动。他说，听说分裂主义者就在本月要在巴库会见，这种会见说不上是一个会议，只是一个反对亚非作家和人民的阴谋。我们一定会胜利，因为我们站在人民一边；他们一定会失败，因为他们站在帝国主义一边。最后，他举杯，提议为亚非作家在下一次大会上再见干杯。
    梁国斌副市长在招待会上祝酒。他感谢森纳那亚克和各位代表在上海参观访问期间，热情赞扬上海人民在中国共产党、毛主席的英明领导和伟大毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，取得的社会主义革命和社会主义建设的成就，高度评价社会主义文化大革命。他说，这对上海人民是巨大的鼓舞。
    据新华社上海三日电　出席亚非作家紧急会议的部分代表今晚乘飞机离开上海回国。今晚，上海各界群众一千多人前往机场欢送亚非朋友。当外国朋友来到机场时，欢送的人们向他们挥舞花束、彩带，敲起锣鼓，少先队员献上了鲜花。欢送的人们不断高呼：“亚非作家大团结万岁！”“全世界人民大团结万岁！”亚非朋友一再和欢送的人们握手、拥抱，道别，互祝在各自的战斗岗位上，为反帝反殖的斗争作出新的贡献。
    出席亚非作家紧急会议的中国代表团副团长刘白羽和部分团员前往机场欢送。上海市有关方面负责人孟波、巴金、冯国柱、张振亚和作家芦芒等也到机场送行。
    今晚到机场欢送的还有来上海访问的出席亚非作家紧急会议的部分外国朋友。
