The entire army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army enthusiastically welcomes the bulletin of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, expressing their most sincere support, most resolute execution, most active propaganda, and most courageous defense of this bulletin of great historical significance.

On the afternoon of the 13th, after the bulletin was issued, the entire army was in high spirits. From the troops stationed in Beijing to the border posts and sentry boxes along the vast coastal and border defenses of the motherland, all units, companies, academies, and logistics units were filled with drumming and singing. People joyfully celebrated the new great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" The slogans echoed through the skies. The leadership organs of the Beijing, Nanjing, and Chengdu troops, which were holding expanded party committee meetings and other meetings, immediately studied and discussed the bulletin after listening to the broadcast and quickly decided to vigorously propagate and study the bulletin. The Guangzhou troops' Taishan Hero Company held a celebration rally in the rain. The Nanjing Road Good Eighth Company put up many wall newspapers and blackboard newspapers supporting the bulletin after listening to the broadcast. The Nanjing troops' coastal defense cultural troupe immediately prepared performances celebrating Chairman Mao's wise leadership and the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, beating drums and gongs to propagate the bulletin among the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Combat hero Mai Xiande shouted "Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" after listening to the broadcast. The political instructor of a certain unit in Xinjiang, a model in studying the works of Chairman Mao, He Jiaruhemaiti, said, "This is an extremely important event in the political life of our people. I support it a thousand times and celebrate it a thousand times!"

The broad ranks of soldiers and officers enthusiastically praised the great historical significance of the bulletin, unanimously believing that the bulletin fully embodies the will of the entire Party and expresses the wishes of 700 million people. Everyone said that the bulletin is a brilliant victory of Mao Zedong Thought, a signal, a call to arms, and a declaration for a new stage of socialist revolution. National People's Congress representative and combat hero Huang Shuying said, "The bulletin is the latest directive of our beloved leader Chairman Mao to the entire Party, the entire nation, and the entire army, a great event of profound historical significance, and a verdict against imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries."

Wu Xingchun, known as the "good son of the Miao and Dong people" and an excellent armed worker, said, "Every word and sentence in the bulletin shines with the great brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, is a new victory of great Mao Zedong Thought, and will have a profound impact on the international communist movement." All comrades in the army firmly believe that by studying and implementing the spirit of this bulletin, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country will surely reach a new high tide and achieve new and greater victories. The thoughts of 700 million people in our country will be further revolutionized, and all fronts of socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country will surely see a new and comprehensive leap forward, making our country an iron fortress of the proletariat that will never change color.

The entire army believes that the bulletin's proposal for the entire nation to learn from the army is the greatest encouragement, the greatest inspiration, and the greatest trust from the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. We must listen to the Party and Chairman Mao, be revolutionaries for life, study Chairman Mao's books for life, resolutely be promoters of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, and be revolutionaries for life. The political instructor of the "Model Company for Studying Chairman Mao's Works, the Red Ninth Company," Qiao Yunqi, said, "Our company was founded on Mao Zedong Thought and has grown stronger under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. In the future, we must turn our company into a revolutionary school that actively learns and applies Mao Zedong Thought to cultivate new people for communism."

The entire army also expressed their determination to respond to the call of the bulletin, to definitely liberate Taiwan, and to definitely increase vigilance a hundredfold. They will definitely support the Vietnamese comrades. As long as the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao give the order, we will dare to climb mountains of swords and walk through seas of fire. If the American imperialists and their running dogs dare to impose war on the Chinese people, we will definitely break their backs and thoroughly, completely, and utterly annihilate them!
