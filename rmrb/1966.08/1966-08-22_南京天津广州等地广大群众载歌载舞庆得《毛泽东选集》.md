Nanjing, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and other places' broad masses sing and dance in celebration of receiving "Selected Works of Mao Zedong"

According to Xinhua News Agency in Nanjing, August 19th, the broad revolutionary students of all higher education institutions in Nanjing all regard August 17th as the most joyous day in their lives, a day they will never forget. On this day, the Jiangsu New China Bookstore supplied 27,950 copies of the newly published "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" to 21 higher education institutions in Nanjing.

When the decorated trucks carrying "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" arrived at each higher education institution, revolutionary students enthusiastically raised portraits of Chairman Mao and placards with Chairman Mao's quotations, beating drums and gongs, setting off firecrackers, singing and dancing around the trucks, and loudly shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" They joyfully sang "The East Is Red" and "The Ship Sails on the Sea Depends on the Helmsman" and other songs. When each student received a copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," they pressed the book tightly to their hearts, tears of joy in their eyes, jumping and shouting "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" Some people wrapped the book covers with the best paper and wrote on them: "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, be a good student of Chairman Mao!" A student from Nanjing Institute of Technology wrote a poem after purchasing the book: "Chairman Mao's works have been distributed, the party's sunshine is shining brightly, thousands and tens of thousands of people sing together, long live the great leader ten thousand times! Chairman Mao's works have been distributed, thousands of words and ten thousand words from the heart, vow to be the successor of the revolutionary cause, trample all ghosts and snakes underfoot!"

According to Xinhua News Agency in Tianjin, August 19th, the broad revolutionary masses in Tianjin are enthusiastically purchasing the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" that have been rushed into print. Yesterday, in just over four hours, more than 80 branches of the Tianjin New China Bookstore and cultural and educational supplies stores sold 104,000 copies of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong."

At dawn on the 18th, many people were already waiting outside the branches of the New China Bookstore. At this time, the radio broadcast the news of Chairman Mao meeting with millions of revolutionary masses from across the country at Tiananmen Square in Beijing. People excitedly said: Chairman Mao is meeting with revolutionary masses in Beijing, and we are buying Chairman Mao's works here, this is truly a double blessing!

At 9 o'clock, the people waiting to buy Chairman Mao's works, amidst the sound of firecrackers and drums, accompanied by the music of "The East Is Red," rushed into the bookstores. Service personnel wearing "double happiness" badges on their chests enthusiastically served the readers. Many readers, after purchasing "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," were overjoyed and excitedly shouted: "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" Some workers and students, after buying the book, immediately read Chairman Mao's quotations aloud to everyone, fully demonstrating the broad revolutionary masses' boundless love for Chairman Mao's works. The entire fourth grade, third class, second team of Cai Shi Primary School wrote in the comment book: This happiest day has finally arrived, because we have bought "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Many readers, after purchasing "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" from the various branches of the bookstores, looked up at the portrait of our beloved great leader Chairman Mao and did not want to leave for a long time.

Since the launch of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Tianjin has supplied more than 720,000 copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

According to Xinhua News Agency in Guangzhou, August 19th, "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" were widely distributed in 14 colleges and universities in Guangzhou on the 17th. That morning, relevant responsible comrades from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's Central-South Bureau Propaganda Department and the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, together with New China Bookstore staff and cadres from the Provincial Committee's Propaganda Department and the Guangzhou Municipal Cultural Bureau, delivered "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" to 14 colleges and universities, selling 7,700 copies, totaling more than 30,000 books.

Early on the 17th, the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of each school were as happy as during a festival, laughing and smiling, with red flags flying in the schoolyard, cheers, firecrackers, and drums creating a hot and lively atmosphere. At 8 o'clock in the morning, when the supply car of the New China Bookstore entered Sun Yat-sen Medical College, the entire school immediately became excited, with all revolutionary teachers and students holding red flags and surrounding the portrait of Chairman Mao entering the celebration venue. Many revolutionary students took turns speaking on stage, full of revolutionary passion, enthusiastically welcoming the wide distribution of Chairman Mao's works.

When the supply car arrived at Sun Yat-sen University, more than 6,000 revolutionary teachers and students from the entire school held portraits of Chairman Mao and placards with Chairman Mao's quotations, forming a queue several hundred meters long, loudly shouting the slogan "Long live Chairman Mao" to welcome it. Students from the half-working, half-studying class of the third year of the Physics Department bought the book and immediately wrote an article for the school radio station. They said in the article: "The party has given us the invincible weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, we will read it for a lifetime, use it for a lifetime, fight against heaven, fight against earth, fight against imperialism, fight against revisionism, fight against the reactionaries, fight against all ghosts and snakes, follow Chairman Mao and revolution forever!" Students from the Geography Department who bought "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" held the book high in their hands and marched in a parade around the campus. They said: We have thousands of words, tens of thousands of words, but the most important sentence is to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and follow Chairman Mao to revolution forever.

On August 14th, the newly published "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" was distributed at Fudan University in Shanghai. The entire school's revolutionary teachers, students, and staff held a grand meeting to receive this revolutionary treasure.

    据新华社南京十九日电　南京市各高等学校的广大革命学生都把八月十七日当作他们一生中大喜的日子，终生最难忘的日子。这一天，江苏省新华书店向南京市二十一所高等学校供应了新出版的《毛泽东选集》二万七千九百五十部。
    当运送《毛泽东选集》的彩车分别来到各高等学校的时候，革命的同学们高举着毛主席像、毛主席语录牌，敲锣打鼓，燃放鞭炮，载歌载舞，围着彩车热烈高呼“毛主席万岁！”纵情高唱《东方红》《大海航行靠舵手》等歌曲。当一本本《毛泽东选集》送到每一个同学手中的时候，他们把毛主席的书紧紧地贴在心口，眼睛里噙着欢乐的泪花，一个劲地蹦跳，一个劲地高呼“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”有的人用最好的纸包上书的封面，还在上面写着：“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好学生！”南京工学院的一位学生在买到书后，怀着激动的心情写下一首诗：“毛主席著作发下来，党的阳光放光彩，千人万人齐歌唱，伟大领袖万万岁！毛主席著作发下来，千言万语出心怀，誓作革命事业接班人，把一切牛鬼蛇神脚下踩！”
    据新华社天津十九日电　天津广大革命群众踊跃购买加速赶印出来的《毛泽东选集》。昨天，仅在四个多小时内，天津市新华书店、文教用品商店设在各处的八十多个门市部就发行《毛泽东选集》十万四千册。
    十八日拂晓，新华书店各门市部的门口，就有许许多多的人等候购书。这时，广播器里传来了毛主席在北京天安门前会见首都和来自全国各地百万革命群众的消息，人们兴奋地说：毛主席在北京会见革命群众，我们在这里购买毛主席著作，这真是喜上加喜，双喜临门！
    九点整，等候购买毛主席著作的人们在鞭炮锣鼓声中，伴随着《东方红》的乐曲，涌进了书店，胸前佩带着“囍”字标志的服务人员，满腔热情地为读者服务。很多读者买到《毛泽东选集》以后兴高采烈，激动地高呼：“伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”有的工人、学生在买到书后，当场就为大家朗读毛主席语录，充分体现了广大革命群众对毛主席著作的无限热爱。菜市小学四年级三班第二小队的全体红领巾在留言簿上写道：这最幸福的一天终于来到了，因为我们买到了《毛泽东选集》。很多读者在书店各门市部买到《毛泽东选集》以后，仰望着我们敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席画像，长久地不愿离去。
    开展无产阶级文化大革命以来，天津市已经供应了七十二万多册《毛主席语录》。

    当供应车开到中山大学时，全校六千多名革命师生举着毛主席画像和毛主席语录牌，列成几百米长的队伍，高呼“毛主席万岁”的口号去迎接。物理系三年级半工半读班的同学买到书后，马上给学校广播站写了一篇文章，他们在文章中说：“党送来战无不胜的毛泽东思想武器，我们要读一辈子，用一辈子，与天斗，与地斗，与帝国主义斗，与修正主义斗，与反动派斗，与一切牛鬼蛇神斗，跟着毛主席永远革命到底！”地理系买到《毛泽东选集》的同学，手里高举着《毛泽东选集》，在校园里列队游行了一周，他们说：我们有千句话，万句话，而最重要的一句话是读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，跟着毛主席永远闹革命。（附图片）
