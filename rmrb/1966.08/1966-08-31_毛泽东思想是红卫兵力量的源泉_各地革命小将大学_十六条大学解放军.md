	Mao Zedong Thought is the Source of Strength for the Red Guards
	Revolutionary Youth Across the Country Study the Sixteen Points and Learn from the PLA

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 30th, Red Guards from all over the country have drawn immense inspiration from the two editorials in People's Daily, "Revolutionary Youth Should Learn from the PLA" and "Salute to Our Red Guards!" They are now more spirited than ever as they participate in the revolutionary storm of destroying the "Four Olds" and establishing the "Four News." They are determined to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, learn from the PLA, and seriously apply the Sixteen Points. Through struggle, they will forge themselves into upright revolutionaries who possess revolutionary skills, and will not disappoint Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's expectations.

	After reading the two editorials in People's Daily, Red Guards from various places felt that Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee had given them high praise for their achievements, and they were greatly inspired. They enthusiastically support the demands made of the Red Guards in the editorials, hailing it as the timely rain they needed most. Red Guards from various schools in the capital, who are near Chairman Mao, have issued appeals, distributed leaflets, and made street speeches over the past two days, expressing their firm response to Chairman Mao's great call. They will definitely study the PLA and the Sixteen Points, and turn the Red Guard organizations into fighting collectives like the PLA. After studying the editorials, Red Guards in Shanghai have expressed their determination to never disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations and to forever follow Chairman Mao forward through the waves. Many Red Guards from East China Normal University said excitedly: Wherever our supreme commander Chairman Mao points, we will fight there.

	Revolutionary youth, reflecting on the experiences of the previous stage of struggle, deeply felt that only by studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in struggle, and taking Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle for all actions, can one see clearly and follow the correct path. After the Red Guards from various middle and high schools in Taiyuan seriously studied the editorial, they expressed their determination to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works and seriously learn the Party's policies and guidelines. In Urumqi, revolutionary youth said, in the current class struggle, which is extremely sharp in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the strength of the Red Guards comes from the great Mao Zedong Thought. Only by reading Chairman Mao's books at all times and listening to Chairman Mao's words in all matters, can we continue to advance and achieve victory in the struggle, just like the People's Liberation Army.

	After studying the editorials from People's Daily, revolutionary youth from various places, with great enthusiasm, responded most resolutely and enthusiastically to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, and further learned from the PLA in the struggle. After the editorial was published, many Red Guards in Kunming not only seriously summarized the experiences of the previous stage of struggle and formulated new action plans, but also seriously studied the PLA's Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, determined to become models of executing mass discipline and Party and state policies, just like the PLA. Many Red Guards from various middle schools in Nanning specially held a study session on the editorial from People's Daily. They said at the meeting that the Red Guards are not only a force for making revolution but also a force for defending the people's interests. We must learn from the PLA's spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people, observe mass discipline, and defend the people's interests.

	Through the tempering of struggle and the study of the editorials from People's Daily, Red Guards from various places have further strengthened their ties with the broad revolutionary masses. Their relationship with the masses has become even closer. The young revolutionaries from the Eighth Middle School in Urumqi said, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a revolutionary movement of the broad masses. We must, like the PLA, closely link with the masses, blend with the masses, and humbly learn from the masses, following the mass line in everything. Red Guards from Beijing No. 4 Middle School are determined to learn from the PLA's good style of deepening their ties with the masses, linking with the masses, and relying on the masses in the struggle. In the past two days, many Red Guards, when proposing some initiatives and issuing some declarations, have first conducted propaganda among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, broadly listened to the opinions of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and therefore their revolutionary actions have received even more enthusiastic support from the masses.

	Many revolutionary students from Hunan Normal University emphasized in a discussion on the editorial from People's Daily that in the current revolutionary movement, we must seriously study and apply the Sixteen Points, use the Sixteen Points as a guideline to observe everything, guide everything, and transform everything. Only in this way can we dare to struggle and be good at struggling, and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Over the past two days, Red Guards from Ningxia University, Yao Wu Middle School, and other schools in Yinchuan have printed a large number of propaganda materials and widely propagated the Sixteen Points in urban and suburban areas. Some schools have also sent Red Guard propaganda teams to go door-to-door to propagate among residents, determined to make the Sixteen Points known to every household. More than twenty middle schools in Nanjing have issued an initiative to all Red Guards in the city, calling for a serious study of the Sixteen Points, using the Sixteen Points as the guideline, focusing on the cultural revolution in their units, thoroughly destroying the "Four Olds" and establishing the "Four News," and carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    毛泽东思想是红卫兵力量的源泉
    各地革命小将大学 十六条大学解放军
    据新华社三十日讯  全国各地的红卫兵，从人民日报《革命青少年要向解放军学习》和《向我们的红卫兵致敬！》的社论里，汲取了巨大的鼓舞力量，正在更加意气风发地投入破“四旧”、立“四新”的革命风暴。他们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，向解放军学习，认真运用十六条，在斗争中把自己锻炼成为顶天立地、掌握革命本领的无产阶级革命者，决不辜负毛主席和党中央的期望。
    各地红卫兵读了人民日报的两篇社论，都感到毛主席和党中央对他们的功绩作出了高度的评价，莫不受到极大鼓舞。他们对社论里向红卫兵提出的要求表示最热烈的拥护，欢呼社论使他们更加明确了斗争方向，是他们最需要的及时雨。在毛主席身边的首都各大中学校的红卫兵，这两天纷纷发出倡议书，散发传单，上街演说，表示他们坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，一定要大学解放军，大学十六条，把红卫兵组织办成像解放军那样的战斗集体。上海的红卫兵们学习了社论以后，纷纷表示决不辜负毛主席的殷切期待，一定要永远跟随毛主席破浪前进。华东师范大学许多红卫兵激动地说：我们的最高统帅毛主席指到哪里，我们就战斗到哪里。
    革命青少年们在回顾前一阶段斗争经验的时候，更深切地体会到只有在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想作为一切行动的指导方针，才能心明眼亮方向正，在大风大浪中沿着毛主席开辟的革命航道奋勇向前。太原市大中学校的红卫兵们认真地学习社论以后，纷纷表示要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，认真学习党的方针政策。在乌鲁木齐，革命青少年们说，在当前阶级斗争极其尖锐的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们红卫兵的力量来源于伟大的毛泽东思想。只有像人民解放军那样，时时读毛主席的书，事事听毛主席的话，我们才能在斗争中不断前进，不断胜利。
    经过对人民日报社论的学习，各地革命青少年们怀着巨大的热情，最坚决、最热烈地响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，在斗争中进一步向解放军学习。昆明的红卫兵们在社论发表后，许多人一面认真总结前一段的斗争经验，制订新的行动计划，一面认真学习解放军的三大纪律八项注意，决心要像解放军那样成为执行群众纪律、执行党和国家政策的模范。南宁市许多中学的红卫兵们，专门召开了学习人民日报社论的座谈会。他们在会上谈到，红卫兵既是一支闹革命的队伍，又是一支保卫人民利益的队伍。我们要学习解放军全心全意为人民服务的精神，遵守群众纪律，保卫人民利益。
    通过斗争的锻炼和对人民日报社论的学习，各地红卫兵进一步加强同广大革命群众的联系，他们和群众的关系更加密切了。乌鲁木齐市第八中学的小将们说，无产阶级文化大革命是广大群众的革命运动。我们必须像解放军那样，密切联系群众，和群众打成一片，虚心向群众学习，事事走群众路线。北京四中的红卫兵们，决心在斗争中把解放军深入群众、联系群众、依靠群众的好作风学到手。这两天，许多红卫兵在提出一些倡议和发出一些宣言书时，都事先向工农兵群众进行宣传，广泛倾听工农兵的意见，因此他们的革命行动更加得到群众的热烈拥护。
    湖南师范学院许多革命学生在座谈人民日报社论时强调指出，在当前的革命运动中，一定要认真学好十六条，用好十六条，以十六条为指针，观察一切，指导一切，改造一切。只有这样，才能既敢于斗争，又善于斗争，取得无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    银川市的宁夏大学、要武中学等学校的红卫兵，这两天编印出大量的宣传材料，在市区和郊区广泛宣传十六条。有的学校还派出红卫兵宣传队，挨门逐户地向居民进行宣传，决心要让十六条家喻户晓。南京市有二十多个中等学校的红卫兵向全市红卫兵提出倡议，认真学习十六条，以十六条为纲，以搞好本单位的文化大革命为主，大破“四旧”，大立“四新”，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
