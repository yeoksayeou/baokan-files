One and a half years ago, we followed the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, moving to the countryside to implement the half-farming, half-studying system. We focus on studying while also learning other skills. This means not only studying literature but also learning about industry, agriculture, military affairs, participating in social activities, and joining the cultural revolution to criticize the bourgeoisie. We not only organized Mao Zedong Thought study groups but also read Chairman Mao's works with the poor and lower-middle peasants, bringing Mao Zedong Thought to the fields and into the homes of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Through this one and a half years of practice, we truly understood the meaning of labor, felt the thoughts and emotions of the working people, and learned about class struggle in the countryside. These are things that cannot be learned in the classroom or from books. We deeply feel that by doing this, we can truly become both red and expert, and be tempered into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

We are history majors. In the field of historiography, there is a sharp struggle between historical materialism and historical idealism. Some bourgeois "authorities" and "scholars" in the field of history cling to historical idealism. They distort history, use ancient events to criticize the present, and prepare public opinion for the restoration of capitalism, attempting to cultivate us into successors of the bourgeoisie. After Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article "On the New Historical Drama 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office'" was published, debates arose among students about the so-called "clean officials." Some students believed that even in the old society, there were distinctions between clean and corrupt officials. Later, we took this issue to the poor and lower-middle peasants for discussion. The peasants said: "There were no 'clean officials' in the old society." Some recited a folk song: "The clear river flows east, officials are the enemies of the poor." Others said: "In the old society, good people did not become officials, and those who did were all the same." Still others said: "From high-ranking officials to low-ranking officials, all love money, only the county magistrate's nails are short, and he can squeeze the grassroots until they rebel." These statements all exposed the ugly essence of the so-called "clean officials" in the old society, answering the most fundamental questions in our debates. Based on the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants, we wrote a critical article that was published in the newspaper. At the same time, we criticized the representatives of the bourgeoisie in the school. We criticized the feudal, capitalist, and revisionist educational policies and teaching methods in the school.

Our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, told us: "Our educational policy should enable those who receive education to develop morally, intellectually, and physically, and become socially conscious, cultured laborers." We are advancing under the guidance of Chairman Mao's teachings. One and a half years ago, many of us were not familiar with production. Now, we have mastered the basic production knowledge and techniques for crops such as wheat, corn, and cotton, and have also learned other agricultural production skills. One and a half years ago, some of us were admirers of bourgeois "authorities" and "scholars"; now, we have become their critics. One and a half years ago, some of us were still trapped in piles of old books and could not escape. Now, we have our hearts set on the country, our eyes on the world, and together with the broad masses of people, we are advancing rapidly in the great three revolutionary movements under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. What a great change this is! This change comes from the great Mao Zedong Thought.

    以学为主　兼学别样
    西北大学历史系一、二年级全体学生
    一年半以前，我们按照党中央和毛主席的教导，搬到了农村，实行半农半读。我们以学为主，兼学别样。就是说，不但学文，也要学工业，学农业，学军事，参加社会活动，参加批判资产阶级的文化大革命斗争。我们不但自己组织了毛主席著作学习小组，而且和贫下中农一道读毛主席的书，把毛主席著作带到田间，带到贫下中农家里。
    经过这一年半的实践，我们真正懂得了劳动的意义，体会到劳动人民的思想感情，了解了农村的阶级斗争。这都是过去在课堂上、书本里学不到的。我们深深体会到，这样做，使我们能够真正做到又红又专，锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    我们是学历史的。在史学阵地上，充满着历史唯物主义和历史唯心主义的尖锐斗争。一些史学界的资产阶级“权威”、“学者”，死抱着历史唯心主义不放。他们歪曲历史，借古讽今，为资本主义复辟进行舆论准备，企图把我们培养成为资产阶级的接班人。当姚文元同志的《评新编历史剧〈海瑞罢官〉》一文发表以后，在同学中对所谓“清官”问题也出现了一些争论。个别同学认为，旧社会还是有清官、贪官之分的。后来我们把这个问题拿到贫下中农中间去和他们一起讨论，贫下中农表示：旧社会根本没有“清官”。有的念着当时的民谣道：“清河水，向东流，当官的是穷人的死对头。”有的说：“旧社会好人不做官，做官都一般。”有的说：“一品官，二品官，大小官员都爱钱，唯有本县指甲短，扣得草根能朝天。”这些，都一针见血地道出了旧社会所谓“清官”的丑恶本质，解答了我们争论中最本质的问题。我们根据贫下中农的意见，写出了一篇批判文章，在报纸上发表了。与此同时，我们还批判了学校中的资产阶级代表人物。批判了学校里形形色色的封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的教育路线和教学方法。
    我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席告诉我们：“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”我们正遵循着毛主席的教导不断前进。一年半前，我们不少人对生产还不熟悉。现在，我们已经初步掌握了小麦、玉米、棉花等作物的基本生产知识和技术，还学会了其它一些农业生产的本领。一年半前，我们有些同学还是资产阶级“权威”“学者”的向往者；现在，我们已经成为这些“权威”、“学者”的批判者。一年半前，我们有的同学还被束缚在古书堆里，不能自拔。现在，我们已经胸怀祖国，放眼世界，同广大群众一起，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，在伟大的三大革命运动中飞速前进了。这变化是多么大啊！这变化来自伟大的毛泽东思想。
