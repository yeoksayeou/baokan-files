	Illuminating Our Hearts and Brightening Our Eyes

	Dear Party, Dear Leader Chairman Mao: At this time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is surging forward, when we are engaged in fierce struggle against the class enemy in stormy seas, we have heard your decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. You have spoken the words that are in the hearts of every revolutionary youth, the words that are in the hearts of the people of the entire nation. Our blood boils with excitement, and we cannot suppress our inner enthusiasm. We raise our arms a thousand times, ten thousand times to shout: Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live the most beloved Leader Chairman Mao! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

	The Party Central Committee's brilliant decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a shining manifestation of the great Mao Zedong Thought. It is not only the guiding document for this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution but will also make a great contribution to the international communist movement. It has not only great contemporary significance but also great historical significance. It illuminates the path of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, illuminates our hearts, brightens our eyes, points out the direction for our advance, and accelerates our battle pace. It has come to our hands at the very moment when we need it most. We deeply feel that only the Party and the most beloved Leader Chairman Mao truly understand the feelings of every revolutionary fighter.

	Although we are young and lack experience in revolutionary struggle, as long as we follow you closely, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions, we fear nothing. We will forever follow you forward through stormy seas! As long as you give the order, we dare to climb the knife mountain and cross the fire sea. In this great Cultural Revolution, we are determined to carry forward the fearless revolutionary spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, and to complete the glorious tasks of "one struggle, two criticisms, three reforms." We are determined to reform ourselves and forge ourselves into staunch revolutionary successors of the proletariat. Not only will we be able to shoulder the responsibility of the Chinese revolution, but we will also plant the red flag of proletarian revolution all over the world.

	Firmly carry out the Party Central Committee's decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

	Long live the Communist Party of China!

	Long live the most beloved Leader Chairman Mao!

    照亮了我们的心　擦亮了我们的眼
    敬爱的党，敬爱的领袖毛主席：正当无产阶级文化大革命蓬勃向前发展的时候，正当我们在大风大浪中与阶级敌人进行激烈斗争的时候，我们听到了您发出的关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定，您说出了我们每个革命青年的心里话，说出了全国人民的心里话。我们顿时热血沸腾，抑制不住内心的激动，我们高举双臂一千次、一万次地高呼：中国共产党万岁！最最敬爱的领袖毛主席万岁！战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的英明决定，是伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉体现。它不仅是这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的纲领性文件，而且将对国际共产主义运动作出巨大的贡献。它不仅具有伟大的现实意义，而且具有伟大的历史意义。它照亮了无产阶级文化大革命的道路，也照亮了我们的心，擦亮了我们的眼睛，指明了我们前进的方向，加速了我们战斗的进程。它是在我们最最需要的时候，及时地送到了我们的手中。我们深深地感到：只有党和最敬爱的领袖毛主席，才最了解我们每个革命战士的心情。
    我们虽然年轻，缺乏革命斗争的经验，但是我们紧紧地跟着您，听您的话，照您的指示办，就什么也不怕。我们将永远跟着您在大风大浪中前进！只要您一声令下，我们刀山敢上，火海也敢闯。在这场伟大的文化大革命运动中，我们决心发扬天不怕，地不怕，敢想、敢说、敢闯的大无畏革命精神，胜利完成“一斗、二批、三改”的光荣任务。我们决心改造自己，把自己锻炼成为无产阶级的坚强的革命接班人。我们不但能够挑起中国革命的重担，而且要把无产阶级革命的红旗插遍全世界。
    坚决贯彻执行党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定！
    中国共产党万岁！
    最最敬爱的领袖毛主席万岁！
