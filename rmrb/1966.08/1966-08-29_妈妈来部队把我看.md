Title: My Mother Visits the Troops to See Me

My mother visits the troops to see me,
She says my appearance has changed so much,
Before I was thin and short,
Now my face is dark and my shoulders broad.

Mother's words were not yet finished,
I spoke to her with these words:
Mother, growing taller is not all,
My thoughts are changing too;
I study Chairman Mao's works every day,
I am making rapid progress and adding more enthusiasm.

Mother, the revolutionary furnace has tempered me,
It has forged a hero's courage in me;
Thinking of Wang Jie and Liu Yunjun,
What fear is there of a thousand hardships and ten thousand dangers?
I can cross great rivers and seas,
I dare to climb steep peaks and rugged mountains!

There are countless heartfelt words,
But it's hard to say them all at once;
Mother heard this and her heart was filled with joy,
Her eyes smiled into a single line.

Mother patted my shoulder,
And repeatedly urged me:
Always listen to the Party's words,
Firmly hold the rifle to protect the country!

  妈妈来部队把我看
  解放军某部战士　张兰生
  妈妈来队把我看，
  说我面貌大改变，
  从前瘦小个儿矮，
  如今脸黑肩又宽。
  妈妈的话儿未说完，
  我对妈妈开了言：
  妈妈呀，个儿长高还不算，
  我的思想也在变；
  毛主席著作天天学，
  我进步快呀干劲添。
  妈妈呀，革命熔炉把我炼，
  炼就一身英雄胆；
  想起王杰、刘英俊，
  何惧千难与万险；
  大江大海我能渡，
  险峰峻岭我敢攀！
  知心的话儿有千万，
  一时难得说个完；
  妈妈听了心高兴，
  两眼笑成一条线。
  妈妈拍拍我的肩，
  叮咛一遍又一遍：
  要永远听党的话，
  紧握枪杆保江山！
