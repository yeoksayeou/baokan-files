Agriculture Must Be Conducted Under the Guidance of Class Struggle

Lü Yulan, Party Branch Secretary of Dongliushan Village, Linxi County, Hebei Province

Sun Yefang insists on a reactionary stance, claiming that the main contradiction in a socialist society is between "people" and "things," denying Chairman Mao's theory on class and class struggle. We firmly oppose this. Let me tell you, Sun Yefang, your tricks cannot deceive us poor and lower-middle peasants.

Chairman Mao has long taught us that even after completing the socialist transformation of ownership, classes have not been eliminated, and class struggle still exists. This class struggle is long-term, tortuous, complex, and sometimes very intense. It will run through the entire historical period of socialism. The facts of class struggle in our Dongliushan Village also prove that Chairman Mao's judgment is completely correct.

After graduating from primary school, I returned to the village and, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, wholeheartedly worked to improve collective production. However, the class enemies tried every means to sabotage our efforts. When I and the villagers planted trees and built forests, the class enemies secretly destroyed the trees. When I and the villagers raised pigs and accumulated fertilizer, the class enemies, taking advantage of my absence at a county meeting, killed all the pigs and wrote a black letter to the meeting, falsely accusing me. They also fabricated facts in the village, incited the masses, and gathered a group of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, and speculators to cause trouble, trying to force me out of office. At this time, I studied Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao told us: "Work is struggle." He also said: "After the enemies with guns have been eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist, and they will inevitably fight to the death with us. We must not underestimate these enemies. If we do not raise and recognize the problem in this way now, we will make a great mistake." With Mao Zedong Thought in my mind, I became clear-headed and resolute, and my fighting spirit was even stronger. I knew that this class struggle was inevitable; they were not just fighting me, but the socialist path that I was upholding. Therefore, when the enemy fought against me, I remained unshaken, first observing their tricks, and then exposing their plots. Under the leadership of the higher-level Party Committee, I and the poor and lower-middle peasants finally defeated them, and agricultural production also improved. In this practical struggle, Chairman Mao's teachings raised my class consciousness. The class enemies also served as my negative teachers. Thus, I gained a very important experience: to carry out the revolution, to defend the socialist homeland and ensure it never changes color, and to improve agricultural production, one must take class struggle as the key.

Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. The theory of class and class struggle is the core of Mao Zedong Thought. Sun Yefang tries to use the shameless lie that the main contradiction in socialist society is between "people" and "things" to negate Chairman Mao's theory on class and class struggle, which is to oppose Mao Zedong Thought and to undermine our lifeline. We must grasp the weapon of class struggle, firmly hold the plow, the pen, and the gun, fight against the black gangs, eliminate the black line, and defend our power and lifeline!

    办农业要以阶级斗争为纲
    河北省临西县东留善固大队党支部书记　吕玉兰
    孙冶方坚持反动立场，胡说什么社会主义社会的主要矛盾是“人”和“物”的矛盾，否定毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的理论，我们坚决不允许。告诉你，孙冶方，你那种鬼花招，蒙蔽不了我们贫下中农。
    毛主席早就教导我们，在社会主义国家里，即使完成了所有制的社会主义改造，阶级并没有消灭，阶级和阶级斗争依然存在。这种阶级斗争是长期的，曲折的，复杂的，有时甚至是很激烈的，它将贯串在社会主义的整个历史时期。我们东留善固大队阶级斗争的事实，也证明毛主席这个论断是完全正确的。
    我高小毕业回村后，和俺村贫下中农一起，一心想把集体生产搞好，但是阶级敌人却千方百计进行破坏。我和群众植树造林，阶级敌人就背地里破坏树林；我和群众养猪积肥，阶级敌人就趁我在县里开会时，把猪全部杀掉，给大会写黑信，诬告我。他们还在村里捏造事实，蛊惑群众，纠合一帮地富反坏右和投机倒把分子闹事，想推我下台。这时，我学习了毛主席著作。毛主席告诉我们：“工作就是斗争。”又说：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。如果我们现在不是这样地提出问题和认识问题，我们就要犯极大的错误。”我脑子里装上毛泽东思想，就心明眼亮意志坚，斗争勇气更足了。我知道这种阶级斗争是不可避免的，他们斗的不仅是我，而且是我坚持的社会主义道路。因此敌人斗我，我毫不动摇，先看他们耍的什么花招，然后揭露他们的阴谋。在上级党委的领导下，我和贫下中农一起，终于把他们斗倒了，农业生产也搞好了。在这场实际斗争中，毛主席的教导，提高了我的阶级觉悟。阶级敌人也当了我的反面教员。于是，我得到了一条非常重要的经验：要干革命，要保卫住社会主义江山永不变色，要搞好农业生产，就要以阶级斗争为纲。
    毛泽东思想是我们的命根子。阶级和阶级斗争的理论，是毛泽东思想的核心。孙冶方企图用所谓社会主义社会的主要矛盾是“人”和“物”的矛盾的无耻谰言，来抹杀毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的理论，就是反对毛泽东思想，就是要挖我们的命根子。我们一定要掌握阶级斗争这个武器，紧握锄杆子、笔杆子、枪杆子，斗垮黑帮，搞掉黑线，保卫我们的印把子、命根子！
