In the wake of the Central Committee's decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao met with revolutionary masses from the capital.

Chairman Mao said to the crowd, "You must pay attention to national affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!"

The masses said: Chairman Mao's reception this time is a great encouragement to the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and adding boundless strength to us.

The masses surged towards Chairman Mao. Shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long, long live Chairman Mao!" echoed through the sky.

New China News Agency, August 11th: Our great leader, Chairman Mao, arrived at the reception center for the masses at the Communist Party of China Central Committee at 7:15 PM on the 10th, meeting with revolutionary masses from the capital who had come to celebrate the Central Committee's decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao said to the crowd, "You must pay attention to national affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!"

This is a great call to the people of the entire nation from our beloved leader, Chairman Mao.

When our great leader, Chairman Mao, arrived at the reception center for the masses, it sparked a wave of excitement among the crowd:

"Chairman Mao has arrived! Chairman Mao has arrived!"

Tens of thousands of workers, peasants, students, revolutionary cadres, and neighborhood residents from the capital leaped and danced with joy, surging towards Chairman Mao. The waves of "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long, long live Chairman Mao!" echoed through the sky.

In the midst of the crowd's enthusiastic cheers, Chairman Mao walked up to the platform at the reception center. Our great leader was beaming with smiles, waving and greeting the masses gathered around the reception center. At that moment, countless hearts were pounding, countless eyes were filled with tears of emotion, and countless hands reached out towards Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao walked from one side of the platform to the other, extending his hands, shaking hands tightly with the people crowded in front. Chairman Mao spoke with some comrades and greeted the cheering masses around him, saying, "Comrades, good! Comrades, good!"

When Chairman Mao left the reception center, he repeatedly waved to the excited crowd. After Chairman Mao left, the people who had come to congratulate and submit their declarations of resolve were still too excited to leave.

Many people who were standing at the back surged forward, shaking hands with those who had shaken hands with Chairman Mao. Those who had shaken hands with Chairman Mao thought to themselves: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! It is with these great hands that you have written numerous revolutionary articles, pointing the way forward for all the people of China. It is you who led us to overthrow the three great mountains, led us to carry out the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Now, these hands are showing us the direction of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Many who had shaken hands with Chairman Mao told everyone: Come quickly and shake hands with me! My hand has just shaken hands with Chairman Mao! Some people rushed over later, saying that even being able to walk to the place where Chairman Mao had just met with the revolutionary masses was the greatest happiness! They sang "The East Is Red," "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," and "I Love Chairman Mao's Books" over and over again.

Many people, upon hearing the news of Chairman Mao meeting with revolutionary masses from the capital, wrote big red congratulatory banners and declarations of resolve through the night and sent them to the reception center for the masses. They wrote on the banners: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long, long live!" and expressed their resolve to Chairman Mao, vowing to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, forever follow Chairman Mao, and advance through the storms.

Many workers, suburban commune members, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres excitedly said: In the current high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great leader, Chairman Mao, receiving the masses who came to the Party Central Committee is a matter of great historical significance. Our great leader trusts the masses the most, cares for the masses the most, and supports the revolutionary actions of the masses the most. Chairman Mao and the revolutionary masses truly have hearts that beat as one.

They said: Chairman Mao's reception this time is a great encouragement to the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and adding boundless strength to us. With the wise leadership of our great leader, Chairman Mao, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution we are currently carrying out will definitely achieve complete and thorough victory!

Since the evening of the 8th, after the Central Committee's decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was issued, the revolutionary masses of the capital have been immersed in joy and excitement. The queues of masses coming to the reception center at the Party Central Committee to deliver congratulatory banners and declarations of resolve have been unending for days. They held high red flags, carried giant portraits of our great leader, Chairman Mao, beat drums and gongs, shouted slogans, and sang revolutionary songs. Many young people also held bouquets of flowers, singing and dancing, expressing their deepest love for Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee and their resolve to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    新华社十一日讯　我们伟大的领袖毛主席，十日下午七时十五分来到中共中央所在地的群众接待站，会见了前来庆贺党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命决定的首都革命群众。
    毛主席向大家说：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”
    这是毛主席向全国人民发出的伟大号召。
    我们敬爱的领袖毛主席来到群众接待站的时候，引起了群众的一片欢腾声：
    “毛主席来了！毛主席来了！”
    成千上万的首都工人、农民、学生、革命干部和街道居民，狂欢跳跃，向毛主席涌去。“毛主席万岁”、“毛主席万万岁”的声浪，响彻天空。
    毛主席在群众热烈欢呼声中，走上接待站的讲台。我们伟大的领袖满面笑容，一面看着摆在接待站周围的贺信、喜报和决心书，一面向汇聚在接待站周围的人们亲切招手致意。这时，多少颗火热的心在激烈跳动，多少双眼睛闪着感动的泪花，多少双手一齐向毛主席伸了过来。
    毛主席在讲台上，从这边走到那边，伸出双手，和拥簇在前面的人们紧紧相握。毛主席和一些同志谈了话，还向周围欢呼的群众问好。他说：“同志们好！同志们好！”
    毛主席离开接待站的时候，一再向欢腾的群众招手。毛主席离开后，前来贺喜和送交决心书的人们，还是激动得不愿走。
    许多站在后面的人拥到前面，和握过毛主席手的人紧握。同毛主席握过手的人心里想：毛主席呀，毛主席！就是你用这双伟大的手，写出了大量的革命文章，给全中国人民指出了前进的道路，是你领导我们推翻了三座大山，领导我们进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设，现在你这双手又给我们指明了无产阶级文化大革命的方向。许多和毛主席握过手的人，他们逢人就说：你们赶快来和我握手啊！我的手是刚才和毛主席握过的！还有一些人随后赶来，他们说，能够走到毛主席刚刚同革命群众见面的地方，也是最大的幸福啊！他们一遍又一遍地唱着《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》、《毛主席的书我最爱读》。
    许多人听到毛主席会见首都革命群众的喜讯，连夜写了大红喜报和决心书，送到了群众接待站。他们在喜报上写着：“毛主席万岁！万岁！！万万岁！！！”并且向毛主席表示决心，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远跟着毛主席，在大风大浪中前进。
    许多工人、郊区人民公社社员、革命知识分子和革命干部激动地说：在当前无产阶级文化大革命高潮中，我们伟大的领袖毛主席接待来到党中央的群众，是一件有伟大历史意义的事情。我们的伟大领袖最相信群众，最关心群众，最支持群众的革命行动。毛主席和革命群众真是心连着心。
    他们说：毛主席这次接待，是对无产阶级革命派的巨大鼓舞，大大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，给我们增添了无穷的力量。我们有伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导，我们正在进行的无产阶级文化大革命一定能取得完全彻底的胜利！
    从八日晚上党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定发布以后，首都革命群众就一直沉浸在欢欣鼓舞之中。到党中央所在地接待站送喜报、送决心书的群众队伍，几天来始终络绎不绝。他们高举着红旗，抬着伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画象，敲锣打鼓，高呼口号，高唱革命歌曲。许多青少年还手持花束花环，载歌载舞，表达了他们对毛主席、党中央最最热爱的心情和把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的决心。
