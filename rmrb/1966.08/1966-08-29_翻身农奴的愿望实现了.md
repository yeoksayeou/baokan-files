The Red Guards and revolutionary citizens of various ethnic groups in Lhasa today are filled with revolutionary passion, united as one, and are making a great revolution in the ancient city of Lhasa. The entire city is a scene of boiling revolutionary fervor.

The broad masses of impoverished residents in the Jiazhuang Street Residents' Committee of Lhasa's urban area, at the initiative of the Red Guard revolutionary youngsters, have been vigorously denouncing the crimes of the reactionary serf owners who used to live here and the "Langzi Office" (the reactionary former Lhasa municipal government) established here. They have also denounced the crimes of the reactionary elements in nearby temples who continued to poison and exploit the people after the democratic reforms, and have changed the name of "Jiazhuang Street" to "Lixin Avenue." They said, "The old Jiazhuang Street was a place for turning prayer wheels (a superstitious activity) and a place where the working people were homeless. We must break with the old world and create and build a new world, which means we must destroy the old and establish the new!"

The Red Guards and revolutionary masses gathered in the new urban area of Lhasa today also changed the name of the "Menzikang" (Medical Bureau, i.e., Lhasa Tibetan Hospital), originally named by the reactionary local government of Tibet, to "Labor People's Hospital"; changed the name of the important stronghold of the armed rebellion launched by the Tibetan local government—the Yaowang Mountain—to "Victory Peak" in commemoration of the victory in suppressing the rebellion; and changed the name of the lair of the Dalai Lamas of successive generations, which has a history of more than two hundred years of political rule, economic exploitation, and religious intoxication—Loblingka—to "People's Park." The revolutionary masses joyfully said, "The aspirations of us serfs who have overturned our fate for many years have finally been realized today!"

    翻身农奴的愿望实现了
    拉萨市各民族的红卫兵和革命的市民群众，今天满怀革命激情，团结一心，在拉萨古城大闹革命。全城到处是一片沸腾的革命景象。
    拉萨市城区八角街居民委员会的广大贫苦市民，在红卫兵革命小将的倡议下，连日来激烈地控诉了往日居住在这里的反动农奴主和设置在这里的“郎子辖”（反动的原拉萨市政府）的罪行，控诉了附近寺庙中的反动分子在民主改革后继续毒害和剥削人民群众的罪行，并把“八角街”改名为“立新大街”。他们说，旧八角街是转经（一种迷信活动）的地方，是劳动人民流离失所的地方，我们要和旧世界决裂，创造和建设新世界，就要破旧立新！
    汇集在拉萨新市区的红卫兵和革命群众，今天还把原西藏反动地方政府命名的“门孜康”（医算局，即拉萨市藏医院），改名为“劳动人民医院”；把原西藏地方政府发动武装叛乱时的重要据点——药王山，改名为纪念平叛胜利的“胜利峰”；把历世达赖进行政治统治、经济剥削、宗教麻醉的有二百多年历史的巢穴——罗布林卡，改名为“人民公园”。革命群众欢欣鼓舞地说，我们翻身农奴多年的愿望今天终于实现了！
