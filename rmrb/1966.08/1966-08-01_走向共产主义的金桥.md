People who come to Daqing see how we have developed such a great oil field in just a few years and are very happy. When they enter our Fengshou Village, they are even more delighted. Daqing is like this: men work in the factories, women work in the fields; we have both industry and agriculture, combining industry and agriculture, and urban and rural areas.

In Fengshou Village, there are rows of neat and tidy "rammed earth" houses, mainly built by our family members. The canteen, nursery, school, clinic, store, and mending station are all run by our family members. The vast farmland around the village is also mostly reclaimed by our family members. In our Fengshou Village, we don't need to go out for food, clothing, or daily necessities; even the noodles and pancakes each family eats are prepared by the workshop for us. Such a village—is it a city? It looks like a countryside. Is it a countryside? It looks like a city. As everyone says, this is a city-like countryside and a countryside-like city.

This road to socialist happiness is one that the Party and Chairman Mao have led us to take. In our place, housewives are no longer like they were in the past, with their minds filled only with trivial matters about their husbands and children. Everyone studies Chairman Mao's works, does revolutionary work, thinks about the collective, loves labor, and walks the socialist path. In the past two years, our family members and workers together built a city-countryside integrated industrial and agricultural village. We work, study, and criticize the bourgeoisie and anti-Party, anti-socialist cliques. We, who were once looked down upon in the old society, have become critics of the old society and the main force in building socialism. Just take this year as an example: our Fengshou Village planted over three thousand mu of land, which can produce tens of millions of jin of grain. Now the wheat has started to be harvested, and the initial test harvest shows that each mu of land can increase production by 20% compared to last year.

Here, every day brings new changes. The village is changing, the fields are changing, but most fundamentally, people's thoughts are changing. We Daqing people listen most to the Party and Chairman Mao. We rely on Mao Zedong Thought and on the revolutionization of people's thinking. With new people of communism, any miracle in the world can be created. When everyone has ideological problems, they think of how Dr. Norman Bethune was selfless and dedicated to others; when personal and collective interests conflict, they think of how Zhang Side completely and thoroughly served the people; when faced with difficulties, they think of how the Old Man Moving Mountains moved two big mountains. Recently, during the wheat harvest, as soon as the sun rose, everyone went to the fields. To ensure that not a single grain is lost, even if only half a stalk of wheat is dropped per square meter, everyone continues to check, saying that what is dropped is not one or two stalks of wheat, but the revolutionary spirit.

Take our first production team's Wang Guizhen, for example. Her husband is a fifth-grade worker. According to her past thinking, her family was already well-off, and taking care of her husband and son was enough. However, after studying Chairman Mao's works, participating in collective labor, and recalling class struggles during the winter training, Wang Guizhen has completely changed. This spring, she always took the lead in labor. When she was carrying manure to the fields, it was the time when water would freeze, but she took off her cotton jacket, wore a small shirt, and worked until she was covered in sweat. The Spring Festival is usually a time for rest, but she did not rest. She said that working is not for earning work points but for revolution. She thought of accumulating more fertilizer, producing more grain, supporting national construction, supporting Vietnam, and defeating American imperialism.

With Mao Zedong Thought, not only are the family members changing, but the entire society and the relationship between people are changing. In the past, our workers and family members also had many old ideas and habits. Some workers thought, "As a man, I should be able to support my wife and children, so why should women work?" Some family members also thought this way, believing that being supported by their husbands was a "natural" thing. When the family members of the fifth team, Xun Duomei, started to participate in labor, her husband had some reservations, fearing that she would not be able to take care of the children. After she started working, her thoughts progressed rapidly, and the children grew up healthy in the nursery. Especially after she actively studied Chairman Mao's works and participated in revolutionary actions with the family members, it inspired her husband. Later, not only did he actively support her participation in labor, but he also used his spare time to make her a small blackboard, which she took to the fields to study Chairman Mao's quotations with everyone.

Now, the political awareness of the family members in Fengshou Village has greatly improved, and they have truly become the masters of socialism. Among the more than 390 family members, over 110 have become model family members. Originally, our village had only five party members, and in the past year, 26 sisters have proudly joined the Communist Party. We deeply feel that Mao Zedong Thought guides us to work, study, and criticize the bourgeoisie. This is the golden bridge that leads us to communism.

    走向共产主义的金桥
    大庆职工家属、丰收村教导员　李春云
    来大庆的人，看到我们在几年里就开发了一个这样好的大油田，都非常高兴。进了我们丰收村，人们更是格外欢喜。我们大庆就是这样：男的做工，女的种地；又办工业，又办农业，工农结合，城乡结合。
    丰收村里一排排整整齐齐的“干打垒”房子，主要是我们家属自己盖的。食堂、托儿所、学校、卫生所、商店、缝补站等，是我们家属自己办的。村周围的大片农田，也大部分是我们家属自己开垦出来的。在我们的丰收村里，吃、穿、用都不用出村，连每家吃的面条、煎饼都由作坊给我们预备好了。这样的村子，你说它是城市吧，又象乡村；你说它是乡村吧，又象城市。正如大伙所说的，这里是城市型的乡村，乡村型的城市。
    这条社会主义的幸福大道，是党和毛主席领着我们闯出来的。在我们这里，家庭妇女再也不象过去那样，满脑子里只有丈夫、孩子等生活琐事。大家学的是毛主席著作，干的是革命，想的是集体，爱的是劳动，走的是社会主义道路。这两年，我们家属和职工一起建设了城乡结合的工农村，又劳动，又学习，又批判资产阶级，批判反党反社会主义黑帮。我们这些在旧社会被人家瞧不起的家庭妇女，已经成了旧社会的批判者，成了建设社会主义的主力军。就拿今年来说，我们丰收村种了三千多亩地，能打几十万斤粮食。现在小麦已经开始收割了，初步试打，一亩地可比去年增产两成。
    我们这里，每天都有新的变化，村子在变，田地在变，最根本的还是人的思想在变。我们大庆人最听党的话，最听毛主席的话。我们靠的是毛泽东思想，靠的是人的思想革命化。有了共产主义新人，什么人间奇迹都能创造出来。大家有思想问题，就想白求恩大夫怎样毫不利己、专门利人；个人和集体利益有了矛盾，就想张思德怎样完全、彻底为人民服务；碰到困难，就想愚公老人怎样搬走两座大山。最近收麦子，每天太阳刚一露头，大家就到地里去了。为了做到颗粒还家，每平方米地丢了一穗半麦子，大家还继续检查，都说丢的不是一两穗麦子，丢的是革命作风。
    再拿我们第一生产队王桂珍来说吧，丈夫是五级工，按她过去的想法，家里也够过了，把丈夫和胖小子伺候好就行了。可是经过学习毛主席著作，参加集体劳动，和冬训中进行阶级回忆，王桂珍完全变成另一个人了。今年春天，她劳动始终走在前头，往地里送粪，当时正是滴水成冰的时候，她脱掉棉袄，穿着小布衫，干得满头是汗。春节本来是放假的时候，她不休息，她说干活不是为了挣工分，而是干革命。她想的是多积肥，多打粮，支援国家建设，支援越南，打败美帝。
    有了毛泽东思想，不光是家属在变，整个社会人和人的关系都在变。从前，我们这里的职工和家属也是有很多旧思想、旧习惯的，有的职工认为“就凭我这个男子汉大丈夫还养活不了老婆孩子，还用得着妇女去劳动”；有的家属过去也是这样想的，认为靠丈夫养活是“天经地义”的事。五队家属荀朵梅开始参加劳动的时候，她丈夫思想有些不通，怕她去劳动，小孩看不好。她参加劳动以后，思想进步很快，小孩在托儿所长的很结实。特别是她积极学习毛主席著作，和家属一起闹革命的行动鼓舞了她的丈夫，以后不但积极支持她参加劳动，还抽业余时间给她做了个小黑板，让她带到地头上，跟大伙儿一起学习毛主席语录。
    现在，我们丰收村的家属政治觉悟大大提高，真正成了社会主义的主人。三百九十多名家属中，就有一百一十多人成了五好家属。原来我们村只有五名党员，近一年又有二十六名姐妹光荣地参加了共产党。我们深深地感到，毛泽东思想教导我们又劳动，又学习，又批判资产阶级，这是引导我们走向共产主义的金桥。
