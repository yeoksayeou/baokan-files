We are the critics of the old world. We must criticize and smash all old thoughts, old cultures, old customs, and old habits. All establishments that serve the bourgeoisie, such as barbershops, tailors, photo studios, and second-hand bookstalls, are not exempt. We are determined to rebel against the old world!

Our country has been liberated for seventeen years, but the old thoughts, old cultures, old customs, and old habits from the old society still exist. The overthrown reactionary classes are unwilling to accept their demise. They stubbornly resist and fight us for the ideological battlefield, attempting to corrupt the masses with the old thoughts, old cultures, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes. They aim to conquer people's hearts and strive for a comeback. Chairman Mao said: "To overthrow a political power, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this." Practice has proven that Chairman Mao's judgment is wise, great, and correct.

The bourgeoisie masters understand that to stage a comeback, they must open gaps in their lives to let capitalism spread widely. Some officials in power and so-called technical authorities in barbershops, tailors, photo studios, and second-hand bookstalls, who want to take the capitalist road, try their best to please these bourgeoisie masters, satisfy their desires, and open the door for them. You are driven by money, putting money first. You are guilty against the people!

Firstly, we strongly protest against you—those who serve the bourgeoisie in barbershops, tailors, photo studios, second-hand bookstalls, and those in power and so-called technical authorities who want to take the capitalist road!

For the comeback of capitalism, you have created many Hong Kong-style hairstyles. What "airplane heads," "seamless youth styles," "spiral pagoda styles," and "youth wave styles" are all strange and weird hairstyles. You spray perfume and apply oil, making those hooligans shake their heads and become arrogant.

For the comeback of capitalism, you have made many Hong Kong-style clothes. What "jeans," "jeans jackets," and various colorful and disgusting Hong Kong-style clothes make those hooligans feel proud and full of themselves.

For the comeback of capitalism, you have taken many vulgar and low-level photos, putting those bourgeoisie young masters, young mistresses, and movie stars on a pedestal, making them ecstatic and delighted. The photos you take are despicable, detestable, and infuriating!

For the comeback of capitalism, you have sold many low-level and pornographic adventure novels from ancient to modern times, both Chinese and foreign, satisfying those little bastards. A large number of bourgeoisie ghosts have come out from you, poisoning many young people and nurturing their criminal tendencies.

And those shops, you have displayed so many perfumes, snow lotions, lipsticks, necklaces, and Hong Kong-style clothes, rocket shoes, etc. Who are they prepared for? Do workers, peasants, and soldiers wear perfume and pointed leather shoes?

You do not like the simple, honest, and natural beauty of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in your hearts. You serve those oily-haired, fancy-dressed masters and mistresses. Your souls are filthy and reactionary. You say you serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, but you are selling dog meat under the sign of a sheep's head. Now is the time for you to be thoroughly reformed!

Have you thought about it? If you continue like this, in a few years or decades, capitalism will stage a comeback in China, and the whole of China will change color.

Now, the torrents of the Cultural Revolution are sweeping away the strongholds of the bourgeoisie masters. The bourgeoisie's nest can no longer be protected! For the past seventeen years since liberation, the former Beijing Municipal Committee has turned a blind eye to these matters, hearing but not listening, seeing but not observing, and indulging in hooliganism. They have taken the road of revisionism and capitalism. We are on different paths. Now, we have stood up and become masters of the house. With the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao backing us, we will manage these matters, and we will manage them thoroughly. We will completely eradicate the nests and seeds of revisionism and capitalism and rebel against these old thoughts, old cultures, old customs, and old habits.

Chairman Mao said: "The principles of Marxism are countless, but in the end, it is just one sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.' For thousands of years, it has always been said: 'Oppression is justified, exploitation is justified, rebellion is not justified.' Since Marxism came out, it has overturned this old case, which is a great achievement. This principle is derived from the struggles of the proletariat, and Marx drew the conclusion. Based on this principle, we rebel, we struggle, and we build socialism." We are determined to rebel against the old world. We are justified in rebelling!

Now, the phenomenon of "airplane heads," "jeans," vulgar photos, and pornographic books ruling some barbershops, tailors, photo studios, and second-hand bookstalls can no longer be allowed to continue! We appeal to the revolutionary workers in the barbering, tailoring, and photography industries:

No Hong Kong-style hairstyles! No Hong Kong-style clothes! No vulgar photos! No pornographic books!

We demand that within the shortest time, Hong Kong-style clothes be changed, strange hairstyles be shaved off, pornographic books and vulgar photos be burned. "Jeans" can be changed into shorts, and the remaining parts can be used for patches. "Rocket shoes" can be flattened and changed into sandals. High-heeled shoes can be changed into flat shoes. Bad books and bad photos should be treated as waste.

We appeal to all Red Guards and revolutionary comrades in the city: This struggle concerns the future of China and the world revolution. Do not underestimate these problems. The door to the comeback of the bourgeoisie is precisely opened from these places. Isn't the Soviet Union a good example? Therefore, we must block all loopholes leading to capitalism, smash all nests that cultivate revisionism, and show no mercy!

We also appeal to the revolutionary proletarian factions across the country: Open fire on all remaining old thoughts, old cultures, old customs, and old habits, smash them, and establish new thoughts, new cultures, new customs, and new habits of the proletariat.

Long live the revolutionary spirit of rebellion!
Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!
Long live the Communist Party of China!
Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!
Long live the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

    向旧世界宣战
    北京二中红卫兵
    我们是旧世界的批判者。我们要批判、要砸烂一切旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯。所有为资产阶级服务的理发馆、裁缝铺、照像馆、旧书摊……等等，统统都不例外。我们就是要造旧世界的反！
    我们国家解放十七年了，但旧社会遗留下来的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯仍然存在。被推翻的反动阶级不甘心他们的死亡，他们总是要顽强地表现自己，和我们争夺意识形态领域里的阵地，企图用剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯来腐蚀群众，征服人心，力求达到他们复辟的目的。毛主席说：凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。实践证明，毛主席的论断是英明、伟大、正确的。
    资产阶级的老爷们懂得，要想复辟，必须在生活上打开缺口，使资本主义大泛滥。而理发馆、裁缝铺、照像馆、旧书摊……当中一些要走资本主义道路的当权派、所谓的技术权威们，为了博得这些资产阶级老爷们的欢心，满足他们的奢望，就挖空心思，为他们服务，给他们大开方便之门。你们是金钱挂帅，金钱第一，你们对人民是有罪的！
    首先，我们对你们——为资产阶级服务的理发馆、裁缝铺、照像馆、旧书摊……要走资本主义道路的当权派和所谓的技术权威们提出最最强烈的抗议！
    为了资本主义复辟，你们理出了大量的港式头。什么“飞机头”“无缝青年式”“螺旋宝塔式”“青年波浪式”等等稀奇古怪的发型，还喷上香水，抹上油，使那些流氓们摇头晃脑，得意忘形。
    为了资本主义复辟，你们做出了大量的港式衣裙。什么“牛仔裤”“牛仔衫”以及各式各样花花绿绿令人作呕的港式衣裙，使那些流氓们飘飘然，神气十足。
    为了资本主义复辟，你们照出了许多下流低级的照片，把那些资产阶级少爷小姐电影明星们捧上了天，使他们神魂颠倒，眉飞色舞。你们照出来的像，可恶，可憎，可气！
    为了资本主义复辟，你们贩卖了大量古今中外低级黄色冒险的小说，使那些狗崽子们从你们那里得到了满足。大批资产阶级的阴魂从你们那里飘了出来，毒害了许多青少年，滋育了他们犯罪的苗头。
    还有那些商店，你们摆了那么多香水、雪花膏、口红、项链……等奢侈品，及港式衣裙、火箭鞋等等是给谁预备的？难道工农兵还抹香水，穿尖皮鞋吗？
    你们从心灵深处不喜欢广大的工农兵那种淳朴憨厚自然的美。你们服务的对象是那些油头粉面、衣着华丽的老爷太太们，你们的灵魂深处是肮脏的，反动的。你们口头上也说为工农兵服务，你们是挂羊头卖狗肉。现在是你们彻底改造的时候了！
    你们想过没有，如果再这样下去，那么不出几年，几十年，资本主义就会在中国复辟，整个中国就会改变颜色了。
    现在，文化大革命的洪流正在冲击着资产阶级老爷们盘踞的各个阵地。资产阶级的温床，保不住了！解放十七年来，前北京市委对这些事情不闻不问，听而不闻，视而不见，对流氓作风、流氓行为放纵不管。他们走的是修正主义和资本主义的路，我们和他们是两条路上的人。现在，我们站起来了，当家做主人了。有党中央和毛主席给我们撑腰，对于这样的事情，他们不管，我们要管，而且要管到底。我们要彻底铲除修正主义和资本主义的温床和苗子，造这些旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯的反。
    毛主席说：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理’。几千年来总是说：压迫有理，剥削有理，造反无理。自从马克思主义出来，就把这个旧案翻过来了，这是一个大功劳。这个道理是无产阶级从斗争中得来的，而马克思作了结论。根据这个道理，于是就反抗，就斗争，就干社会主义。”我们就是要造旧世界的反，我们就是造反有理！
    现在，“飞机头”、“牛仔裤”、下流照片和黄色书籍统治一些理发馆、裁缝铺、照相馆和旧书摊……的现象，再也不能让它继续下去了！我们向理发、裁缝、照像等行业的革命职工倡议：
    港式的发型不理！港式的衣裙不做！下流的像不照！黄色的书不卖！
    我们要求在最短时间内改掉港式衣裙、剃去怪式发样、烧毁黄色书籍和下流照片。“牛仔裤”可以改为短裤，余下的部分，可做补钉。“火箭鞋”可以削平，改为凉鞋。高跟鞋改为平底鞋。坏书、坏照片做废品处理。
    我们向全市红卫兵和一切革命的同志呼吁，这场斗争是关系到中国的前途和世界革命的大事。不要小看这些问题，资产阶级复辟的大门正是从这些地方打开的，苏联不是一个很好的例子吗？所以我们一定要堵住一切钻向资本主义的孔道，砸碎一切培育修正主义的温床，决不留情！
    我们也向全国无产阶级革命派呼吁：向残存的一切旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯开火，砸烂它，建立起无产阶级的新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯。
    革命造反精神万岁！
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！万岁！！万万岁！！！
    伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
