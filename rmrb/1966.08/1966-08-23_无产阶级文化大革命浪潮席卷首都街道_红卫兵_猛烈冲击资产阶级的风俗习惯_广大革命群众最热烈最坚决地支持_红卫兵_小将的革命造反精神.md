The tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has swept through the capital's streets. The "Red Guards" have launched a fierce assault on bourgeois customs and habits. The broad revolutionary masses have given their most enthusiastic and resolute support to the revolutionary spirit of rebellion of the "Red Guards."

A Xinhua News Agency report dated August 22nd states: Since August 20th, the "Red Guards" of the capital have taken to the streets in large numbers, posting revolutionary leaflets and big-character posters everywhere, and holding meetings and speeches everywhere, launching a fierce attack on all old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits. Some shop signs with feudalist, capitalist, and revisionist thought have been changed to names with revolutionary significance with their help and propaganda. They have proposed to revolutionary teachers and students in various schools to quickly change some school names that have no political significance. They have also proposed to revolutionary workers in various service industries to no longer give certain customers strange hairstyles, make strange clothes, or sell and rent yellow books and magazines. They want to thoroughly transform Beijing into a highly proletarianized and revolutionary Beijing. The spirit of rebellion and revolutionary actions of the "Red Guards" have received the most enthusiastic and resolute support from revolutionary teachers and students, revolutionary workers, and street residents.

The "Red Guards" of Beijing No. 2 Middle School posted a declaration of war against the old world on the walls of major streets in the city, filled with revolutionary fervor. The declaration states: Now, the torrent of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is sweeping away the strongholds of the bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie's nest can no longer be protected. "Airplane heads," "spiral pagoda-style" strange hairstyles, "jeans," "jeans jackets," and various Hong Kong-style dresses, as well as yellow photographs and magazines, are being severely condemned. We must not underestimate these problems. The door to the restoration of capitalism is precisely opened from these places. In the past seventeen years, the former Beijing Municipal Committee has turned a blind eye and deaf ear to these matters, even prohibiting reforms. They have taken the path of revisionism and capitalism. We are on two different paths. They do not care, but we will take care of it and see it through. We must block all loopholes leading to capitalism and smash all nests that nurture revisionism, showing no mercy.

The "Red Guards" pointed out that Beijing is the capital of socialist China and the center of the proletarian revolution. How can the streets tolerate the stench of names left by imperialism, feudalism, and the bourgeoisie! With the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of citizens, they proposed to change "Chang'an Street" to "East Is Red Avenue," to change the embassy district "Dongjiaomin Lane," which was off-limits to laborers before liberation, to "Anti-Imperialist Street," to change "Xijiaomin Lane" to "Anti-Revisionist Street," to change Wangfujing Street to "Anti-Revisionist Street," and to change Guanghua Road, where the Vietnamese Democratic Republic Embassy is located, to "Aid Vietnam Road." Inspired by the revolutionary spirit of the "Red Guards," the revolutionary workers of the Wangfujing Department Store removed the three large characters "Wangfujing" from the door and renamed it "Beijing Department Store." "Dong'an Market" was changed to "Dongfeng Market." The "Cooperative Hospital" named by the American imperialist invaders was changed to "Anti-Imperialist Hospital." "Tongren Hospital" was changed to "Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Hospital."

The revolutionary workers of "Quanjude" Roast Duck Restaurant, inspired by the "Red Guards" of Beijing No. 2 Middle School, No. 15 Middle School, and No. 63 Middle School, started a revolution, smashed the three characters "Quanjude" that had been hanging for over seventy years, and officially replaced them with the new sign "Beijing Roast Duck Restaurant." Old workers who had worked at "Quanjude" for many years said excitedly, "The three characters 'Quanjude' were forged from the blood and sweat of the capitalists' exploitation of the laborers. We smash it to show our determination to thoroughly smash the remnants of the capitalist exploitation system and to thoroughly sweep away the bad customs left by the bourgeoisie."

The revolutionary workers of "Hendley Watch Shop" had proposed twice since 1964 to change the old sign, but due to the obstruction of the former Beijing Municipal Committee, it had not been realized. Now, inspired by the "Red Guards," after collective discussion, they have changed the name to "Capital Watch Shop."

On the evening of the 20th, when the "Red Guards" changed the name of "Xushunchang Clothing Store," which had been named by a capitalist, to "Dongfeng Clothing Store," the street was filled with applause, and people shouted in unison, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "The East Wind prevails over the West Wind!"

In the glass window of "Rongbaozhai," there is a big-character poster sent by the "Red Guards" of the Affiliated Middle School of the Central Academy of Fine Arts. The poster says: "Rongbaozhai is a black painting shop. For decades, it has plundered the blood and sweat of the laborers, serving the bourgeoisie's young masters, young ladies, and old masters, serving the feudal landlords and rich young masters, serving the reactionary academic authorities of the bourgeoisie. In a word, it does not serve socialism, it does not serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The black gang leader Deng Tuo, who opposes the Party, opposes socialism, and opposes Mao Zedong Thought, is your big boss, old customer! The black painter 'donkey trader' Huang Zhu is your backer. Your place has become a trading post for black gang painters. We are determined to destroy Rongbaozhai!"

The revolutionary actions of the "Red Guards" have received a strong response from the revolutionary workers in the service industries such as barbershops, clothing stores, and bathhouses in recent days. They have held meetings, written letters of determination, and issued statements. A cadre from the Dongcheng District Commodity Management Office said: As early as a year and a half ago, many revolutionary workers in our stores proposed to eliminate the old signs left by the capitalists, but the former Beijing Municipal Committee did not allow us to change them. This time, the "Red Guards" of the capital have done a great job, and we express our enthusiastic support.

The revolutionary workers of "Weidong Clothing Store" (formerly "Blue Sky Fashion Store") wrote in a letter to the "Red Guards": We firmly respond to your revolutionary initiative. We completely agree with the revolutionary actions of the "Red Guards" of Beijing No. 2 Middle School and others to oppose making Hong Kong-style clothing and strange clothes, and we guarantee that we will not process or sell Hong Kong-style clothing and strange clothes in the future. Let us join hands and push the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to a broader and deeper new stage. Some clothing stores have also posted couplets full of revolutionary passion on their doors: "Revolutionary clothing is made quickly and specially, strange clothing is destroyed quickly and specially." The horizontal scroll reads: "Promote the proletariat, destroy the bourgeoisie." (with pictures)

The revolutionary masses of the capital are reading the revolutionary initiatives and big-character posters posted by the "Red Guards."

    无产阶级文化大革命浪潮席卷首都街道
   “红卫兵”猛烈冲击资产阶级的风俗习惯
    广大革命群众最热烈最坚决地支持“红卫兵”小将的革命造反精神
    新华社二十二日讯　八月二十日以来，首都“红卫兵”纷纷走上街头，到处张贴革命传单和大字报，到处集会演说，向一切旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯发动了猛烈攻击。一些带有封建主义、资本主义和修正主义思想色彩的商店字号，在他们的宣传、帮助下，已经更换为具有革命意义的名称。他们向各学校革命师生倡议，迅速改掉一些毫无政治意义的学校名称。他们还向广大服务行业的革命职工倡议，决不再给某些顾客理怪发、做奇装异服、出售和出租黄色书刊。他们要把北京彻底改造成为一个非常无产阶级化、非常革命化的北京。“红卫兵”的造反精神和革命行动，得到了广大革命师生、革命职工和街道居民的最热烈、最坚决的支持。
    北京第二中学的“红卫兵”在市内主要街道的墙头上，贴出充满革命豪情的向旧世界的宣战书。宣战书说：现在，无产阶级文化大革命的洪流，正在冲击着资产阶级的各个阵地。资产阶级的温床保不住了。“飞机头”、“螺旋宝塔式”等稀奇古怪的发型、“牛仔裤”、“牛仔衫”和各式各样的港式衣裙，以及黄色照片书刊，正在受到严重的谴责。我们不要小看这些问题，资产阶级的复辟的大门，正是从这些地方打开的。过去十七年来，前北京市委对这些事情听而不闻，视而不见，甚至禁止改革。他们走的是修正主义和资本主义的路。我们和他们是两条路上的人。他们不管，我们要管，还要管到底。我们一定要堵住一切钻向资本主义的孔道，砸碎一切培育修正主义的温床，决不留情。
    “红卫兵”们指出，北京是社会主义中国的首都，是无产阶级革命的中心，大街上怎能容忍帝国主义、封建主义和资产阶级留下的臭名字！他们在广大市民的热烈支持下，倡议把“长安街”改为“东方红大路”，把解放前禁止劳动人民通行的使馆区“东交民巷”改为“反帝路”，把“西交民巷”改为“反修路”，把王府井大街改为“防修路”，把越南民主共和国大使馆所在地“光华路”改为“援越路”。在“红卫兵”革命精神的鼓舞下，王府井百货大楼的革命职工，搬掉了门上“王府井”三个大字，改名为“北京市百货商店”。“东安市场”被改为“东风市场”。美帝国主义侵略者命名的“协和医院”被改为“反帝医院”。“同仁医院”被改为“工农兵医院”。
    “全聚德”烤鸭店的革命职工在北京二中、十五中、六十三中“红卫兵”的鼓舞下起来闹革命，砸掉挂了七十多年的“全聚德”三个字，正式换上了“北京烤鸭店”的新招牌。在“全聚德”工作多年的老工人们激动地说，“全聚德”三个字是资本家剥削劳动人民的血汗铸成的。我们砸毁它，是决心彻底捣烂资本主义剥削制度的残余，是彻底扫除资产阶级遗留下来的陋规习俗。
    “亨得利钟表店”的革命职工们，在一九六四年以来曾经两次提出改掉老字号的要求，但由于前北京市委阻挠，一直没有实现。现在，职工们在“红卫兵”的鼓舞下，经过集体讨论，已改名为“首都钟表店”。
    二十日晚上，当“红卫兵”把沿用资本家命名的“徐顺昌服装店”改名为“东风服装店”时，街道上顿时响起一片掌声，人们齐声高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“东风压倒西风！”
    在“荣宝斋”的玻璃厨窗里，挂着中央美术学院附中“红卫兵”送的一张大字报。这张大字报说：“荣宝斋是个黑画店，几十年来盘剥劳动人民的血汗，为资产阶级小姐少爷太太老爷服务，为封建地主阔老阔少服务，为资产阶级反动学术权威服务。
    一句话，就是不为社会主义服务，不为工农兵服务。反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的黑帮头子邓拓就是你们的大老板，老主顾！黑画家‘驴贩子’黄胄也是你们的后台，你们这里已经成了黑帮画家的交易所了。我们就是要把荣宝斋打个身败名裂！！”
    “红卫兵”的革命行动，几天来得到了理发馆、成衣店、浴室等服务行业革命职工的热烈响应。他们纷纷开座谈会，写决心书，发表声明。东城区百货管理处的一位干部说：早在一年半前，我们许多商店的革命职工就提出要铲除掉过去遗留下来的资本家的旧字号，但是前北京市委不让我们改换。这次首都的“红卫兵”们干得好，我们表示热烈支持。
    “卫东服装店”（原“蓝天时装店”）全体革命职工在给“红卫兵”的一封信上说：我们坚决响应你们的革命的倡议，我们完全同意北京二中等“红卫兵”关于反对做港式服装和奇装异服的革命行动，保证以后不加工不出售港式服装和奇装异服。让我们携起手来，把无产阶级文化大革命推进到一个更广泛、更深入的新阶段。有些服装店的门上，还贴上了充满革命激情的对联：“革命服装大做特做快做，奇装异服大灭特灭快灭。”横额是：“兴无灭资”。（附图片）
