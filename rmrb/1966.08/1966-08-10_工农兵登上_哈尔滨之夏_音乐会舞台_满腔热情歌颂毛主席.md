The third "Harbin Summer" music festival opened here on the evening of the fifth. This opening performance, themed "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought," lasted for over two hours and featured twenty different types of performances. All the performers were amateur cultural workers from the ranks of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Every song and piece they performed was a battle song of Mao Zedong Thought, a bullet aimed at all the ghosts and snakes, both domestic and foreign.

Over five thousand people participated in this year's music festival performances, representing ten ethnic groups including Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, and Korean. Among them, more than ninety percent were amateur cultural activists from the ranks of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary students and teachers, and women and children from the streets. Many of them are active learners of Chairman Mao's works and advanced figures from various fronts.

    满腔热情歌颂毛主席
    据新华社哈尔滨电　一九六六年“哈尔滨之夏”音乐会于五日晚上在这里开幕。
    这场以“毛泽东思想万岁”为主题的开幕式演出，一共进行了两个多小时，表演了二十个各种形式的节目。参加演出的全部是工农兵业余文艺工作者。他们演唱的每首歌每支曲，都是毛泽东思想的战歌，都是射向国内外一切牛鬼蛇神的子弹。
    参加这届音乐会演出的共有五千多人，包括汉、满、蒙古、回、朝鲜等十个民族。其中工人、农民、战士、革命干部、革命师生和街道妇女、儿童等业余文艺活动积极分子占百分之九十以上。他们当中有许多人是学习毛主席著作积极分子和各条战线上的先进人物。
