Yesterday, more than 50,000 revolutionary masses in Changchun, Jilin Province, finally got their hands on the newly published "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Overwhelmed with emotion, they vowed to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to dedicate their lives to revolution, to study Chairman Mao's works for life, and to pass on Mao Zedong Thought to future generations.

Upon hearing that the New China Bookstore would be selling the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," many people lined up outside the store the night before. The staff, eager to meet the demand, opened the doors early to start selling the books. Many people, clutching their newly purchased "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Mao Zedong Thought ten thousand times!" They also left messages in the store's guestbook expressing their boundless love for Chairman Mao's works. A student from the 11th Middle School, Yang Ancloud, wrote in the guestbook: "With the four-volume golden book in hand, the masses hail Mao Zedong; the revolutionary truth will be passed down for generations; the stormy winds and rains will guide us clearly."

To ensure that the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" quickly reached the hands of the revolutionary masses, the New China Bookstore in Changchun also organized mobile bookstations today.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Zhengzhou on the 17th, the long-awaited "Quotations from Chairman Mao" have been widely distributed in Zhengzhou, Henan Province. Within three days, more than 100,000 copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and individual volumes of Chairman Mao's works have been sold. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers who purchased the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" were overjoyed, waving their arms and shouting, "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!"

The news of the wide distribution of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" spread like lightning throughout the city. For days, the New China Bookstore and its service departments set up in various locations were packed from morning to night with people buying books. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, seeing the radiant "Quotations from Chairman Mao," excitedly said that without the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they would not have been able to buy a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" so soon. This is a victory for our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Some people, after buying the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," jumped for joy, immediately opened the book, and with full throats, recited it with revolutionary fervor.
