	Responding to the "Communiqué": Contributing Everything
	Fujian Frontline Air Force Unit Political Instructor Feng Fusheng

	Upon hearing the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, I felt immensely excited and invigorated. I cannot help but enthusiastically shout: Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China! Long live our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao!

	The Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, under the personal direction of Chairman Mao, comprehensively and deeply analyzed the domestic and international situations and summarized the experiences of the revolutionary struggles at home and abroad over the past few years. This is a meeting that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, marking a new milestone in the revolutionary march of the Chinese people. We heartily celebrate the great achievements of the plenary session and wholeheartedly endorse the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee.

	The "Communiqué" states: "The mass movement of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and broad cadres studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's works has opened a new era for the laboring people to directly grasp and apply Marxism-Leninism." The great Mao Zedong Thought has become the guiding principle for everyone's actions and the first necessity of everyone's life. Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it will become a tremendous material force, a force that no reactionary current can resist, and it will shatter the entire old world and build a brand-new new world.

	In the process of studying Chairman Mao's works, I deeply feel that as long as we hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and use Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon at all times and in all places, there will be no difficulties we cannot overcome, no problems we cannot solve, and no enemies we cannot defeat. We must resolutely respond to the call of the "Communiqué," hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end. We will thoroughly smash the plot of the bourgeoisie to restore power, uproot the roots of revisionism, and ensure that our country, under the guidance of Chairman Mao, will forever advance, forever revolutionize, and never change color.

	As a soldier of the People's Liberation Army, we must further enhance our fighting spirit and vigilance, be ready at any time to liberate Taiwan, be ready at any time to smash the aggression of American imperialism against our country, resolutely support the struggle of the Vietnamese people, and be ready at any time to rush to the front lines of aiding Vietnam and resisting America.

	I solemnly pledge to the Party that I will definitely read Chairman Mao's books more diligently, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. I will be a good soldier of Chairman Mao, grow better in this great school of the People's Liberation Army, and dedicate my entire life to revolution. I will contribute everything for the great call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and for the brilliant and magnificent cause of communism!

　　响应“公报”的号召  贡献自己的一切
　　福建前线部队空军某部指导员　丰福生
    听了八届十一中全会的公报，感到无限激动，无限振奋，我不禁热烈欢呼：伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党万岁！我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
    八届十一中全会，在毛主席亲自主持下，全面地深刻地分析了国内国际形势，总结了几年来国内国际的革命斗争经验。这是一次高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的会议，是我国人民在革命进军道路上的新的里程碑。我们最热烈地庆贺全会的伟大成就，最热烈地拥护八届十一中全会的公报。
    “公报”指出：“工农兵群众、革命知识分子和广大干部活学活用毛泽东同志著作的群众运动，开创了劳动人民直接掌握和运用马克思列宁主义的新纪元。”伟大的毛泽东思想，已经成为每个人的行动指南，成了每个人生活的第一需要。毛泽东思想一旦掌握了群众，就将变成巨大的物质力量，这个力量是任何反动逆流都抵挡不住的，它将打破整个旧世界，建立一个崭新的新世界。
    我在学习毛主席著作的过程中，深深体会到，只要我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，时时处处事事以毛泽东思想作为武器，就没有克服不了的困难，没有解决不了的问题，没有战胜不了的敌人。我们一定要最坚决地响应“公报”的号召，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，彻底粉碎资产阶级的复辟阴谋，挖掉修正主义的根子，保证我们的国家沿着毛主席指引的方向，永远前进，永远革命，永远不变色。
    作为人民解放军的一个战士，我们要更加提高战斗意志，提高警惕，随时准备解放台湾，随时准备粉碎美帝国主义对我国的侵略，坚决支持越南人民的斗争，随时准备奔赴援越抗美的最前线。
    我坚决向党保证，一定要更好地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士，在人民解放军这个大学校里更好地成长，一辈子永远革命，为实现党中央和毛主席的伟大号召，为光辉壮丽的共产主义事业，献出自己的一切！
