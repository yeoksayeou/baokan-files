	Muabi Andre George, Speaker of the National Assembly of Congo (Brazzaville), and his wife, along with members of the Congolese (Brazzaville) parliamentary delegation led by him, attended a gala performance today, accompanied by Chairman Ju De and his wife Kang Qing. They watched the dance drama "The Congo River Roars," which reflects the Congolese (Kinshasa) people's struggle against American aggression and for national liberation.

	Today's gala was held by the China-Africa People's Friendship Association to welcome the Congolese (Brazzaville) parliamentary delegation.

	Before the performance of the dance drama, a red curtain displayed a portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao. At this moment, the entire audience erupted in thunderous applause. Subsequently, the curtain displayed the full text of Chairman Mao's statement on November 28, 1964, "On Supporting the Congolese (Kinshasa) People's Struggle Against American Aggression."

	The performance, which depicted the Congolese (Kinshasa) people's unyielding struggle against the enemy, was warmly received by the Congolese (Brazzaville) parliamentary delegation.

	At the end of the performance, the curtain again displayed four sentences from Chairman Mao's statement: "Strengthen national unity, persist in protracted struggle, the Congolese people will surely win, American imperialism will surely fail."

	Accompanying the Congolese (Brazzaville) friends to watch the performance were Vice-Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo and Liu Ningyi, and Vice-President of the China-Africa Friendship Association Nan Hanchen, among others.

	Jean Daniel Bakula, Chargé d'Affaires of the Congolese (Brazzaville) Embassy in China, embassy officials, and Congolese (Brazzaville) students in Beijing were also invited to watch the performance.

	Speaker Muabi and the Congolese (Brazzaville) parliamentary delegation led by him visited the National Agricultural Exhibition Hall in Beijing today.

	After the visit, Speaker Muabi wrote in the guestbook. The inscription read: "The great significance of the agricultural exhibition we have just visited shows how firmly the people of China are on the path of economic independence and progress. We believe that the Chinese people, under the wise leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, following the words of the Communist Party of China, will surely achieve even greater victories."

	In his inscription, he also praised the exhibition for "reflecting the spirit of the Chinese people in economic reform and the victory of socialism."
