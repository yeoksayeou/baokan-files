We listened with hearts full of excitement to the Party Central Committee's decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the radio, and we feel that our minds are clearer, our eyes are brighter, and our direction is clearer. We fully support the Party Central Committee's decision and will resolutely carry out this decision, enthusiastically propagate this decision, and bravely defend this decision.

The Party Central Committee's "Sixteen Points" decision is a product of the combination of Mao Zedong Thought and the concrete practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is a summary and generalization of the experiences of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past few years, especially the past few months. It comes from the revolutionary practice of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and returns to the revolutionary practice of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. This is another shining exemplar of Chairman Mao's "From the Masses, To the Masses."

Chairman Mao said: "All work for the masses must start from the needs of the masses." The "Sixteen Points" on the Cultural Revolution are the "compass" and "timely rain" for the current Cultural Revolution. This unprecedented and profound revolutionary movement, in which the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, as well as revolutionary intellectuals and revolutionary cadres, widely participate, is a brand-new thing. In this movement, several urgent questions that need to be answered and solved have been raised. At this critical moment, the Party Central Committee made this decision, correctly and timely answering and solving a series of key questions raised in the movement.

Chairman Mao said: "We must believe in the masses, and we must believe in the Party. These are two fundamental principles." The Party Central Committee's decision fully embodies Chairman Mao's great thought. The decision clearly stipulates: the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres are the main force of the revolutionary movement; leaders should be bold and dare to mobilize the masses; rely on the masses, believe in the masses, and let the masses educate themselves in the movement; firmly implement the Party's class line, etc. This once again shows how our Party is full of enthusiasm for the revolutionary mass movement!

We are members of the People's Liberation Army of China. We will not only hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly support and carry out the "Sixteen Points" decision, and actively participate in the Cultural Revolution, but we will also bravely and consciously safeguard the victorious development of this great revolutionary movement. We will definitely not disappoint the Party, Chairman Mao, and the broad masses' trust and expectations in us.

Let us shout with joy:

Long live the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live the victory of the revolutionary mass movement!

Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Long live the Communist Party of China!

Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!

　　“从群众中来，到群众中去”的光辉典范
    我们以万分激动的心情，从广播中听了党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定，感到心里更明了，眼睛更亮了，方向更清了。我们完全拥护党中央的这一决定，并且要坚决执行这一决定，热情地宣传这一决定，勇敢地捍卫这一决定。
    党中央的“十六条”决定，是毛泽东思想与无产阶级文化大革命的具体实践相结合的产物，是几年来、特别是最近几个月以来，无产阶级文化大革命的经验的概括和总结。它来自广大工农兵群众的革命实践，又回到广大工农兵群众的革命实践中去。这是运用毛主席的“从群众中来，到群众中去”的又一个光辉典范。
    毛主席说：“一切为群众的工作都要从群众的需要出发”。文化大革命“十六条”，正是目前文化大革命的“方向盘”“及时雨”。这场广大工农兵群众和革命知识分子、革命干部广泛参加的空前深刻的革命运动，是一个崭新的事物。在这个运动中，提出了若干迫切需要做出解答和解决的新问题。就在这样一个紧要时刻，党中央做出了这一决定，正确地、及时地解答和解决了运动中所提出来的一系列的关键性问题。
    毛主席说：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。”党中央的决定集中地体现了毛主席这一伟大思想。决定中明确规定：广大工农兵群众、革命的知识分子和革命的干部是革命运动的主力军；要求领导者要“敢”字当头，放手发动群众；要依靠群众，相信群众，让群众在运动中自己教育自己；要坚决执行党的阶级路线，等等。这就再一次表现了我们党对于革命的群众运动是怀着何等满腔热忱啊！
    我们是中国人民解放军的成员，我们不仅要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决拥护和执行“十六条”决定，积极参加文化大革命，而且还要勇敢地、自觉地保卫这场伟大的革命运动的胜利发展。我们一定不会辜负党、毛主席和广大人民对我们的信任和希望。
    让我们纵情欢呼：
    伟大的毛泽东思想胜利万岁！
    革命的群众运动胜利万岁！
    无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！万万岁！
