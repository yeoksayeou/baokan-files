We workers must be critics of the old world. We, the working class, are the masters of a socialist country. To be good masters and firmly hold the reins, we must be critics of the old world. To be critics of the old world, we must master Mao Zedong Thought, the sharpest weapon.

National People's Congress representative and foreman of the steel reinforcement team at Tianjin Building Components Factory, Lu Shān, said: Chairman Mao's recent call for all sectors to become revolutionary schools is a new development of Marxism-Leninism, reflecting the fundamental interests of the working class. We will resolutely and faithfully carry out Chairman Mao's great directive.

Chairman Mao calls on us workers to study politics and culture. In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have a deeper and more intimate understanding of Chairman Mao's directive.

In the old society, the working class was exploited and oppressed, deprived of the right to education; most construction workers were illiterate. In 1957, when rightists fiercely attacked the Party, we old workers were very indignant, but we couldn't write to refute them.

The situation is quite different in this Cultural Revolution. Over the past few years, under the leadership and care of the Party, many workers have acquired some education and can now take up the pen to fight against the representatives of the bourgeoisie who oppose the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought.

The 35 members of our steel reinforcement team have written more than 40 articles and held nine study sessions on applying Chairman Mao's works during this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We learn through struggle and apply what we learn in struggle, standing firm and clear in our stance. In one study session, old worker Dong Wenyi criticized the bourgeois "authority's" fallacy of "establishing before destroying," saying: "Establishing before destroying is sheer nonsense. It's a trick the class enemy uses to deceive us. If we hadn't destroyed Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary regime and the reactionary Kuomintang army, could the great New China have been established?" His words hit the nail on the head and were a powerful criticism!

We, the working class, are the masters of a socialist country. To be good masters and firmly hold the reins, we must be critics of the old world. To be critics of the old world, we must master culture and the sharpest weapon, Mao Zedong Thought. Only by criticizing the old world can we defend and build the new world.

From studying Chairman Mao's great directive, our comrades in the steel reinforcement team have further realized: revolutionary workers must, as Chairman Mao instructs, be able to build socialism with a hammer, criticize the bourgeoisie with a pen, and defend socialism with a gun.

    我们工人一定要做旧世界的批判者
    我们工人阶级是社会主义国家的主人，要当好主人，牢牢掌握印把子，就一定要作旧世界的批判者。要作旧世界的批判者，就一定要掌握毛泽东思想这一最锐利的武器。
    全国人民代表大会代表天津建筑构件一厂钢筋队长  卢珊
    毛主席最近提出的各行各业都要办成革命化的大学校的伟大号召，是对马克思列宁主义划时代的新发展，集中地反映了我们工人阶级的根本利益，我们将最坚决、最忠实地贯彻执行毛主席的这一伟大指示。
    毛主席号召我们工人要学政治，学文化。在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们对毛主席的这个指示体会得更深刻、更亲切了。
    在旧社会，我们工人阶级受剥削、受压迫，失去了读书的权利；大部分建筑工人没有文化。一九五七年，右派分子向党猖狂进攻的时候，我们老工人十分气愤，有一肚子话要说，可就是提不起笔杆子来批驳。
    在这次文化大革命中，情况可大不一样了。因为这几年在党的领导和关怀下，我们很多工人掌握了文化，可以挥笔上阵，来同反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的资产阶级代表人物进行斗争了。
    我们钢筋队的三十五个人，在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，先后写了四十多篇文章，举行了九次活学活用毛主席著作讲用会。我们在斗争中学，在斗争中用，立场坚定，态度鲜明。在一次讲用会上，老工人董文义批判资产阶级“权威”的“先立后破”的谬论时说：“先立后破，完全是胡说，这是阶级敌人胡弄我们的鬼花招，不先破蒋介石的反动政权，不先破国民党的反动军队，伟大的新中国能够立得起来吗？”他的话一针见血，真是批判得有力！
    我们工人阶级是社会主义国家的主人，要当好主人，牢牢掌握印把子，就一定要作旧世界的批判者。要作旧世界的批判者，就一定要掌握文化，掌握最锐利的武器毛泽东思想。只有批判了旧世界，才能保卫和建设新世界。
    我们钢筋队的同志们，从学习毛主席的这一伟大指示中，进一步认识到：革命工人一定要象毛主席指示我们那样，拿起锤子能建设社会主义，拿起笔杆子能批判资产阶级，拿起枪杆子能保卫社会主义。
