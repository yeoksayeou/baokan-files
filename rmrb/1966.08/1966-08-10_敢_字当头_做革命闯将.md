We enthusiastically hail the Party Central Committee's decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and this historic and programmatic document.

The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have placed unlimited hopes in us and entrusted us with the glorious revolutionary tasks. The Party Central Committee's decision has further bolstered our resolve and strengthened our revolutionary spirit. We must follow the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, be revolutionary pioneers, and be bold. We must dare to revolutionize, dare to fight in the storms of class struggle. Those who dare not think, speak, act, or venture throughout their lives will never become revolutionaries!

We are all revolutionary youth of the Mao Zedong era. We not only need to dare to revolutionize but also to be good at it. The Party Central Committee's decision has pointed out a clear direction for us. We must distinguish between enemies, friends, and ourselves, select our targets, concentrate our forces, and fiercely strike down a handful of die-hard counter-revolutionaries and anti-socialist demons.

Although we are all young, we have the Party Central Committee guiding us and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon. We fear nothing and dare to shoulder any revolutionary burden. We can even conquer the most stubborn bourgeois fortresses. We must rebel against the bourgeoisie and revisionism, and we will surely succeed! Long live our most beloved leader Chairman Mao! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    “敢”字当头  做革命闯将
    我们最热烈欢呼党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定，欢呼这个具有伟大历史意义的纲领性文件。
    党中央和毛主席把无限的希望寄托在我们身上，把光荣的革命任务交给我们。党中央的决定，进一步撑了我们的腰，长了我们的革命志气，我们一定要按照党中央和毛主席的指示，当革命的闯将，“敢”字当头，敢于革命，敢于在阶级斗争的大风大浪里搏斗。一辈子不敢想、不敢说、不敢做、不敢闯的人，一辈子也当不了革命派！
    我们都是毛泽东时代的革命青年，不仅要敢于革命，还要善于革命。党中央的这个决定给我们指出了明确的方向，我们一定要分清敌、我、友，选准目标，集中火力，狠狠打击一小撮死心踏地反党反社会主义的牛鬼蛇神。
    尽管我们都很年轻，但我们有党中央给我们指路，有战无不胜的毛泽东思想作武器，我们什么都不怕，什么样的革命重担都敢挑，再顽固的资产阶级堡垒也能攻克。我们一定要造资产阶级、修正主义的反，我们一定能造资产阶级、修正主义的反！我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席万岁！战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
