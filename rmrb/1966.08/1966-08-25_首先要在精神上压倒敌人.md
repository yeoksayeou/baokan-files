History has proven and will continue to prove that Chairman Mao's statement in his "Talk with the American Journalist Anna Louise Strong" that "all reactionaries are paper tigers" is the greatest scientific foresight in human history and the fundamental strategic thought for revolutionary people to struggle and achieve victory. It has given all oppressed nations and peoples around the world immense strength, first and foremost in spirit, to overcome imperialism and all reactionaries.

American imperialism is the largest imperialist power in the world today and also the largest paper tiger. Over a decade ago, this paper tiger was beaten by us to the point of utter defeat; now, after some repairs, it has crossed the ocean to the battlefields of Vietnam, baring its fangs and claws, pretending to be powerful. In reality, it is still a paper tiger, even more fragile. It will inevitably suffer an even more disastrous defeat than it did on the Korean battlefield.

In January 1951, our company fought against two battalions of the U.S. imperialists' "elite" 1st Cavalry Division on the southern bank of the Han River in Korea, at the 311 Hill, for three days and three nights. In this battle, the enemy used eight planes, dozens of cannons, thirty tanks and trucks, while we had only two 60mm cannons, one heavy machine gun, and the rest were rifles and hand grenades. However, we firmly believed that we represented progress while the enemy represented reaction, and our war was just, so we would definitely defeat the enemy. Because we first overcame the enemy in spirit and followed Chairman Mao's strategic and tactical principles, taking the initiative to attack and strike from the side and rear; at night, we also raided the enemy's villages, harassing and tiring the enemy, fighting very actively. We successfully repelled the enemy's seventeen frenzied attacks. The so-called "elite" 1st Cavalry Division of the United States did not advance even a step but left behind over three hundred corpses.

This is how we deal with imperialism and all reactionaries: first, it depends on whether you are afraid in spirit. If you are not afraid of it, it will have no way to deal with you. "In battle, the brave win." Ultimately, wars are fought by people. As long as we have people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, with high class consciousness, the intangible spiritual force will turn into enormous material force. One person can be equal to several or dozens of people. Even if there is no way, a way will be found, and even the strongest enemy can be trampled underfoot.

Courage and wisdom come from Mao Zedong Thought. The situation on the battlefield changes rapidly, often requiring people to make decisions within one or two seconds. If you are overwhelmed in spirit by the enemy, fearing this and that, you will become hesitant. Only by overcoming the enemy in spirit can you best flexibly and agilely apply Chairman Mao's tactical thoughts and demonstrate the greatest wisdom.

We fought a defensive battle at 311 Hill, but according to the terrain, we placed our main force in the forests on both sides, acting flexibly and striking the enemy from the side and rear. The enemy's battalion attacked several times but still could not figure out where our main force was. Facing an enemy ten times stronger and better equipped, if we did not believe we could definitely defeat the enemy, how could we strike the enemy so flexibly and cleverly? Each of our soldiers was the same. Once, an enemy hand grenade fell at a soldier's feet, and our soldier immediately picked it up and threw it back, exploding right in the enemy's crowd, using the enemy's weapon to kill the enemy. Even a second's hesitation would not have been enough. At this critical moment, why did our soldier react so quickly and act so bravely and wisely? It was because we had Chairman Mao's thought that all reactionaries are paper tigers.

Courage makes one wise, cowardice makes one stupid. When facing the enemy in combat, having the spirit to overcome the enemy can unleash tremendous wisdom and create astonishing miracles.

Of course, overcoming the enemy in spirit does not mean that in action, we should not pay attention to the enemy. On the contrary, in action, we should pay attention to it and fight the paper tiger as if it were a real tiger. Overcoming the enemy in spirit is daring to struggle, and paying attention to the enemy in action is being good at struggling. Only by daring to struggle can one be calm, composed, think of ways, and bravely and wisely defeat the enemy. Winning a battle raises morale, fighting more bravely, and becoming stronger in battle. This is the dialectic of strategically despising the enemy and tactically taking the enemy seriously, daring to struggle and being good at struggling.

    首先要在精神上压倒敌人
    前中国人民志愿军二级战斗英雄、特等功臣　徐恒禄
    历史已经证明而且必将继续证明：毛主席在《和美国记者安娜·路易斯·斯特朗的谈话》中提出的“一切反动派都是纸老虎”的英明论断，是人类历史上最伟大的科学预见，是革命人民进行斗争、争取胜利的根本战略思想。它给了全世界一切被压迫民族和人民以巨大的力量，首先在精神上压倒帝国主义和一切反动派。
    美帝国主义是当今世界上最大的帝国主义，也是最大的纸老虎。十几年前，这个纸老虎被我们打得焦头烂额，一败涂地；现在它修补了一下，又远隔重洋来到越南战场，张牙舞爪，装成很有力量的样子。其实，它仍然是一只纸老虎，而且更加虚弱。它必定要遭到比在朝鲜战场上更惨的失败。
    一九五一年一月，我们连在朝鲜汉江南岸三一一高地，同美帝国主义的“王牌”骑一师两个营打了三天三夜。这次战斗，敌人用了八架飞机，几十门大炮，三十辆坦克和汽车；而我们只有两门六○炮、一挺重机枪，其它就是步枪、手榴弹。但是我们坚信：我们代表进步，而敌人代表反动，我们所进行的战争是正义的，一定能打败敌人。由于我们首先在精神上压倒了敌人，同时遵照毛主席的战略战术原则，主动出击，猛打侧后；夜间我们又袭击敌人的驻村，扰敌疲敌，打得非常主动，连续打退敌人十七次疯狂进攻。所谓“王牌”的美国骑一师两个营，不仅一步也没有前进，反而丢下三百多具尸首。
    对待帝国主义和一切反动派就是这样：首先决定于精神上怕不怕。你不怕它，它就对你没办法。“两军相逢勇者胜”。归根到底，仗要靠人去打。只要有了毛泽东思想武装的人，每个人的阶级觉悟高高的，无形的精神力量就会转化为巨大的物质力量。一个人能当几个人、几十个人。没有办法，也会想出办法，再强大的敌人也能踩在脚下。
    智慧来自勇敢，来自毛泽东思想。战场上的情况瞬息万变，往往需要人们在一两秒钟内就做出决定。如果精神上被敌人压住了，怕这怕那，就会变得缩手缩脚。只有精神上压倒了敌人，才能最好地灵活机动地运用毛主席的战术思想，才能表现出最大的智慧。
    我们在三一一高地打的是守备战，但是我们根据地形，把主要力量布置在两侧的丛林里，灵活机动，从侧后猛打敌人。敌人一个连进攻好几次，还摸不清我们的主力到底在那里。面对十数倍于己、装备占优势的敌人，要是不相信自己一定能战胜敌人，怎能这样灵活机智地打击敌人呢？我们的每一个战士也是这样。一次，敌人的手榴弹落在一个战士的脚下，我们的战士就马上拾起来扔回去，正好在敌人群里爆炸了，用敌人的武器消灭了敌人。这要是迟疑一秒钟也是不行的。在这关键的时刻，我们的战士为什么反应这么快，这样机智勇敢呢？就是由于有了毛主席关于一切反动派都是纸老虎的思想。
    勇敢使人聪明，怯懦使人愚蠢。跟敌人面对面作斗争，有了压倒敌人的精神，就可以迸发出巨大的智慧，创造出惊人的奇迹。
    当然，精神上压倒敌人，并不是说行动上不要重视敌人。相反，在行动上，我们要重视它，要把纸老虎当成真老虎打。精神上压倒敌人是敢于斗争，行动上重视敌人是善于斗争。只有敢于斗争，才能沉着、冷静、想办法，机智勇敢地把敌人打倒。斗赢一次，士气就高一步，越斗越勇，越战越强。这就是战略上藐视敌人和战术上重视敌人、敢于斗争和善于斗争的辩证法。
