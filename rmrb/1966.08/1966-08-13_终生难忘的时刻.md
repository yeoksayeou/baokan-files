We are filled with immense excitement and our eyes are brimming with tears of joy as we write this letter with the hand that has shaken our most beloved Chairman Mao. We express our boundless love, loyalty, trust, and reverence for our great leader, Chairman Mao, and our firm resolve to carry out Chairman Mao's instructions to "concern ourselves with state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!"

At 7:25 PM on August 10, in this unforgettable moment, we saw with our own eyes Chairman Mao, whom we have longed for day and night. Happily, we shook hands with Chairman Mao. We have a thousand words to say to Chairman Mao. We have only one wish: to definitely follow your words, concern ourselves with state affairs, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

We excitedly shouted: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!

Chairman Mao, in the midst of his busy schedule, met with revolutionary masses. This shows that Chairman Mao is always concerned about and supports the struggles of the revolutionary people, and also shows that Chairman Mao cares about the people and trusts the people the most. This meeting is a great encouragement to us. We are determined, in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to study Chairman Mao's works diligently, to foster the bold spirit of daring to think, speak, act, and revolutionize, to use the hand that Chairman Mao has shaken to thoroughly uproot the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, to sweep away all monsters and demons, to thoroughly criticize the bourgeoisie and all exploitative class ideologies, to smash the old educational system, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

We wish our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, eternal life!

　　终生难忘的时刻
    我们怀着无比激动的心情，眼含着满眶的热泪，用给最敬爱的毛主席握过的手写这封信，表达我们对我们伟大的领袖毛主席，无限热爱，无限忠诚，无限信赖，无限崇敬的心情，和坚决执行毛主席的指示“关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”的决心。
    八月十日下午七时二十五分，这个终生难忘的时刻，我们亲眼见到了日日夜夜想念的毛主席，我们幸福地握住毛主席的手，有千言万语要对毛主席讲。我们只有一个心愿：一定听您的话，关心国家大事，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    我们激动地高呼：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    毛主席在百忙中会见革命群众，这说明毛主席时刻关心和支持革命人民的斗争，也说明毛主席最关心群众、信任群众。这次会见，对我们是一个极大鼓舞。我们决心在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，活学活用毛主席著作，发扬敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯、敢革命的大无畏革命精神，用毛主席握过的手，彻底挖掉党内走资本主义道路的当权派的根子，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，彻底批判资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的意识形态，砸烂旧学制，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    祝最最敬爱的领袖毛主席万寿无疆！
