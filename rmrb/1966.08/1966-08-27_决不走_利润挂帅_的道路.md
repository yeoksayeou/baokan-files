We will never take the path of "profit first." Sun Yefang advocates for "profit first," which is an attempt to make socialist economics deviate from the political track of the proletariat, aiming to achieve a "peaceful evolution" plot. We old workers are very clear about what "profit first" is all about. In the old society, capitalists ran businesses solely to pursue maximum profits. They disregarded the lives of workers and used various deceitful methods to cheat customers.

In a socialist society, the working class is the master of the enterprise. We engage in production to meet the needs of the revolution, for the construction of the country and the people's livelihood, not for profits. We must run socialist enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought and must not follow the revisionist path advocated by Sun Yefang. Only in this way can we adhere to the socialist direction. Chairman Mao has long said: "Our country has more than 500 million agricultural population. The situation of the peasants is of great importance to the development of our economy and the consolidation of our political power." Following Chairman Mao's instructions, we have established the idea of wholeheartedly serving the more than 500 million peasants, striving to improve product quality and reduce costs, and producing a large number of industrial products that are cheap and good for agricultural production. These industrial products are seen by the peasants as support from the working class, as the concern of the Party and Chairman Mao for the peasants. Every water turbine generator produced by our factory brings light and happiness to the countryside, and the peasant brothers are overjoyed, saying, "This is the light and happiness brought to us by the Party and Chairman Mao!"

According to the needs of the countryside, we have designed and manufactured various specifications of water turbines, which not only have a large workload but also yield very little profit, and sometimes even incur losses per unit. If we were to follow Sun Yefang's advocacy of "profit first," we would not produce these products. What would be the result? It would inevitably lead to industry detaching from the agricultural base, the breakdown of the worker-peasant alliance, and the destruction of the entire socialist economy and the foundation of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

To better support agriculture, our factory almost every year sends a team of workers to form a technical service team to go to the countryside and serve the development of electrification. According to Sun Yefang's advocacy of "profit first," these are all foolish things that should not be done; but in our view, these are all good deeds for building socialism.

It is clear that Sun Yefang's advocacy of "profit first" is a thorough and complete revisionist commodity. To defend the socialist cause, we, the working class, must thoroughly smash this revisionist commodity of Sun Yefang.

    决不走“利润挂帅”的道路
    重庆市五好工人、重庆水轮机厂　李洪炳
    孙冶方主张“利润挂帅”，就是妄图使社会主义的经济脱离无产阶级政治的轨道，实现“和平演变”的阴谋。我们老工人都很清楚“利润挂帅”是个什么货色。在旧社会，资本家办企业就是为了追逐最大限度的利润。他们为了追求利润，不顾工人的死活，并且采取弄虚作假等手法欺骗买主。
    在社会主义社会，工人阶级是企业的主人。我们搞生产是为了革命的需要，为了国家建设和人民生活的需要，而不是为了利润。我们必须按照毛泽东思想办社会主义企业，决不能走孙冶方主张的修正主义道路。只有这样，我们才能坚持社会主义的方向。毛主席早就说过：“我国有五亿多农业人口，农民的情况如何，对于我国经济的发展和政权的巩固，关系极大。”我们遵照毛主席的指示，树立了全心全意为五亿农民服务的思想，努力提高产品质量，降低成本，为农业生产了大量价廉物美的工业产品。这些工业产品在农民的心目中，被看成是工人阶级的支援，是党和毛主席对农民的关怀。我们厂生产的每一台水轮发电机，在农村发出电来的时候，农民兄弟都欢欣鼓舞地说：“这是党和毛主席给我们带来了光明和幸福！”
    我们根据农村需要，因地制宜地设计和制造了各种规格的水轮机，不仅工作量很大，而且盈利也很小，有时从单台产品来看还要亏本。如果按照孙冶方的“利润挂帅”的主张，我们就不去生产这些产品，那会带来什么结果呢？那就必然会造成工业脱离农业的基础，工农联盟遭到破坏，从而使整个社会主义经济和无产阶级专政的基础遭到破坏。
    为了更好地支援农业，我们厂里几乎每年还要抽出一批工人组成技术服务队，下乡为农村发展电气化服务。按照孙冶方的“利润挂帅”的主张来看，这都是不该做的蠢事；而在我们看来，这却都是建设社会主义的好事。
    很显然，孙冶方鼓吹的“利润挂帅”是彻头彻尾的修正主义货色。为了保卫社会主义的江山，我们工人阶级一定要把孙冶方这套修正主义的货色彻底粉碎。
