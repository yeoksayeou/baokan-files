Pass Down the "Remember Bitterness, Taste Sweetness" Day
Tan Zhonglan, Secretary of the Communist Party Branch of Liangtong Production Brigade, Wuming County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region

Recently, the Party members and poor and lower-middle peasants of our brigade responded to the call of the Party branch committee and held a "Remember Bitterness, Taste Sweetness" day on the eve of the Party's birthday—June 30. We have established this as an annual tradition to be passed down from year to year.

On this day, every household hung a portrait of Chairman Mao and wrote in large characters: "Remember Bitterness, Taste Sweetness Day—Never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forget to emphasize politics, never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought." During the day, everyone continued with their usual production. At dinner time, each family ate a "bitter meal" as it was in the old days, recounted their hardships, and conducted a comparison between the old and new societies to educate the younger generation to remember the bitterness of the old society and to forever love the Party and Chairman Mao, forever read Chairman Mao's books, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions to carry the socialist revolution to the end.

Our brigade had installed electric lights in every household last year. This evening, all the lights in the brigade were turned off. Some members lit oil lamps, while others burned pine torches. Poor peasant Huang Rongben, while eating the bitter meal, did not light a lamp. His children complained, "It's so dark, it's inconvenient!" Rongben said, "Children, in the old society, our ancestors never had electric lights, and sometimes we didn't even have food to eat. We had to go up the mountain to dig wild vegetables to fill our stomachs." His youngest son, Rixin, couldn't swallow the bitter vegetables and started crying. His older brother, Jixian, comforted him, "You have to eat the bitterness; if you don't, you won't know what kind of life your parents had in the old society, and you will forget your roots."

The chairman of the poor and lower-middle peasants association of the second production team, Huang Xuguang, boiled a pot of pumpkins in the morning and finished it by noon. In the evening, he did not light a fire to cook. Neighbors asked him why. He said, "My ancestors for five generations worked as laborers and often went without meals. Tonight, not eating this meal and sitting down to think about the past is also good." He also took out the "four treasures" used to dig wild vegetables in the old society: a broken hoe, a rotten grass rope, a broken bamboo basket, and a broken sack. As he touched them, he recalled the bitterness.

The members of the Tan Zhou production team gathered to eat the bitter meal and invited 70-year-old old farmer Zhou Juzhong to tell the village history. Zhou Juzhong, with tears in his eyes, said, "Today's bitter meal has pumpkins, sweet potato leaves, and wild radish (a kind of wild vegetable), which is already quite good! I remember the year of the great drought (1900), all the wild vegetables on the nearby mountains were dug up, and the villagers fled to beg for food, with more than fifty people dying of disease and hunger. Now, with the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have achieved communalization, passed the water conservancy, and are free from drought and flood. This is a great happiness!" Poor peasant female member Huang Jinlan added, "Just mentioning the past, my tears flow uncontrollably. In the old society, my family had no food to eat, and a younger brother and sister starved to death. Now, thanks to the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, our lives have improved. Now, a handful of anti-Party, anti-socialist villains want us to go back to the old days. I truly hate them. Whoever opposes the Party, opposes socialism, and opposes Mao Zedong Thought, we poor and lower-middle peasants will fight to the end!" Finally, they raised their arms and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Communist Party of China!"

The next day—July 1st—was the Party's birthday. All Party members and brigade members, with the spirit of Comrade Norman Bethune who "never seeks gain for oneself and always seeks to help others," did good deeds for the collective or for others. Some repaired bridges and roads, some planted trees and protected forests, and some chopped firewood and carried water for the five-guarantee households. In the evening, the members gathered to read Chairman Mao's works and invited people to talk about the glorious history of the Party. They expressed their boundless love, trust, and gratitude for the Party and Chairman Mao with the heart of the Zhuang ethnic minority song: "Seventeen years of national construction, the face has changed ten thousand times, the happy life is good, the Party's merits come first. Resolutely support the Communist Party, all the people praise Chairman Mao, the three red banners are held high, the song of progress never ends."

Why do we hold this "Remember Bitterness, Taste Sweetness" day?

In May this year, the Party branch mobilized all the brigade members to study Chairman Mao's works. To let the leading cadres take the lead in studying and using them well, the branch committee members and the brigade poor and lower-middle peasants association committee members gathered to recall bitterness and ate a bitter meal. While eating, the brigade leader Liang Qijun and the women's federation chairman Li Caidi thought of their lives in the old society and couldn't help but cry. Li Caidi ate one bowl after another, saying, "The more I eat, the sweeter today's life feels." Some Party members and old poor peasants said, "Now some young people do not understand how hard life was in the old society; some peasants, after liberation, have gradually forgotten the bitterness of the old days. It would be best if everyone ate a bitter meal once a year, so that the genealogy of the poor and lower-middle peasants is passed down from generation to generation, and everyone firmly walks the socialist path." The branch accepted everyone's suggestion and did this.

### 把“忆苦思甜日”制度传下去

    把“忆苦思甜日”制度传下去
    中共广西壮族自治区武鸣县梁同大队总支书记　覃中兰
    前些时候，我们大队的共产党员和贫农下中农，响应党总支委员会的号召，在迎接党的生日的前一天——六月三十日，过了一个有深刻的阶级教育意义的“忆苦思甜日”。我们已把它定为制度，要一年一年地传下去。
    这一天，家家户户挂上毛主席像，用大字写着：“忆苦思甜日——念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗”。白天，大家照常生产。晚饭时，家家都按解放前的样子吃“苦餐”，讲苦史，进行新旧两个社会对比，教育青年一代牢记旧社会的苦，永远热爱党和毛主席，永远读毛主席的书，照毛主席的指示办事，将社会主义革命进行到底。
    我们大队去年就家家都安上了电灯。这天晚上，全大队的电灯都熄灭了。有的社员点上桐油灯，有的家里燃着松明。贫农黄荣本吃“苦餐”时，没有点灯，孩子们吵吵说：“黑麻麻的，不方便！”荣本说：“孩子们，在旧社会，我们世世代代都没有电灯，连饭也没有吃的，还要上山挖野菜充饥哩。”他的小儿子日新吃着苦菜咽不下去，哭起来了。哥哥继先劝他说：“苦也要吃，不吃就不晓得父母在旧社会过的什么日子，就会忘本。”
    第二生产队贫农下中农协会主席黄旭光，当天早上煮了一锅南瓜，上午就吃完了，晚上没有起火做饭，邻居们问他为什么？他说：“我祖上五代人打长工，经常有一顿无一顿，今晚这一顿不吃，坐下来想想过去也好。”他还找出在旧社会挖野菜用的“四件宝”：一把破烂锄头，一根烂草绳，一个破竹篓，一个破口袋。一边抚摸，一边忆苦。
    谭周生产队的社员集中在一起吃“苦餐”，请七十岁的老农周巨忠讲村史。周巨忠热泪满眶地说：“今天我们吃的‘苦餐’，有南瓜、红薯叶、雷公根（一种野菜），这还是不错的呢！记得庚子年（一九○○年）大旱，附近山上的野菜都挖光了，村人四处逃荒讨饭，病死饿死五十多人。现在有共产党和毛主席的英明领导，实现了公社化，水利过了关，旱涝无忧，真是天大的幸福！”贫农女社员黄金兰接着说：“一提起过去的事，我的眼泪就止不住地流。旧社会我家就因为没有吃的，饿死了一个弟弟、一个妹妹。现在靠党和毛主席的领导，我们的日子过好了。现在，一小撮反党反社会主义的坏蛋，想要我们走回头路，我真恨透了他们。谁要反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想，我们贫下中农就要同他拚到底！”最后，他们振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！中国共产党万岁！”
    第二天——七月一日，是党的生日。全大队的党员和社员都用白求恩同志“毫不利己专门利人”的精神，为集体或者为别人做好事。有的人修桥补路，有的人种树护林，有的人给五保户打柴挑水。晚上，社员们都集中起来读毛主席著作，找人讲党的光荣历史。他们以对党、对毛主席无限热爱、无限信赖和无限感激的心情，用壮族民歌唱道：“祖国建设十七年，面貌改变万万千，幸福生活过得好，党的功劳记在先。坚决拥护共产党，万民齐颂毛主席，三面红旗高高举，跃进歌声唱不完。”
    我们为什么要举行这个“忆苦思甜日”呢？
    今年五月里，党总支发动全大队社员学习毛主席著作，为了让领导骨干带头学好、带头用好，总支委员和大队贫农下中农协会委员，在一起忆苦，吃了一次“苦餐”。吃的时候，大队长梁期均、妇代会主任李彩芹想起在旧社会的生活情景，都止不住地哭起来。李彩芹吃了一碗又添一碗，她说：“越吃越觉得今日生活甜。”有些党员、老贫农说：“现在有些青年人，不懂得旧社会的苦日子是怎样过的；有的农民，翻身后对过去的苦日子也逐渐淡漠起来。最好是每年让大家吃一次‘苦餐’，使贫下中农的家谱代代相传，使大家坚定地走社会主义道路。”总支接受了大家的建议，就这样做了。
