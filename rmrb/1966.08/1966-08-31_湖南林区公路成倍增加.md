In the first half of this year, the number of roads built and opened to traffic in Hunan Province's forest areas increased by 1.7 times compared to the same period last year, with the overall quality generally improved.

In the process of leading the construction of these roads, the various party committees in Hunan have, in addition to establishing a small number of specialized teams, mainly mobilized the masses in the forest areas to participate in the construction during their off-farm seasons. On the construction sites, the relevant leading departments have organized cadres and the masses to study Chairman Mao's works such as "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "Qu Yuan's Indignation" from the beginning to the end, promoting the revolutionization of everyone's thinking. Through the study of Chairman Mao's works, cadres and the masses are full of enthusiasm and vigor, overcoming various difficulties and completing the road construction tasks quickly, efficiently, and economically.

    湖南林区公路成倍增加
    今年上半年，湖南省建成通车的林区公路，比去年同期增加一点七倍，质量一般有所提高。
    湖南各地党委在领导修建这些公路的过程中，除了建立少量的专业队伍外，主要是充分发动林区群众利用农闲时间参加建设的。在工地上，各有关领导部门自始至终组织干部、群众学习毛主席的《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》《愚公移山》等文章，促进大家的思想革命化。由于学习了毛主席著作，干部、群众意气风发，干劲冲天，战胜了各种困难，多快好省地完成了修路任务。（据新华社讯）
