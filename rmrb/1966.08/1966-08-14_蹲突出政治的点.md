Title: Focus on Political Points During Shallow Placements

We county committee comrades often go to the grassroots branches for shallow placements. Based on our experience, there are different ways to do shallow placements. Whether to focus on production points or political points makes a big difference in the results.

In the past, we only focused on production and neglected politics and class struggle. The county committee only saw production as the central task, and the county committee secretary became the director of the agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy bureaus, paying little attention to party building. The masses criticized the county committee leadership for "only focusing on hoes and not on people," and "only focusing on grain, cotton, and oil, but not on enemies and friends." Under this guiding ideology, when we went to the grassroots branches for shallow placements, we did not focus on political points but on production points. As a result, the support points had more manpower, more money, and more materials. The masses said, "Such points can only be seen, not learned from."

After we seriously studied Chairman Mao's thoughts on party building, our understanding improved significantly. Chairman Mao said: "Our party, our army, although most of them are pure, to lead the revolutionary movement to develop better and faster, we must thoroughly rectify them in terms of ideology and organization. And to rectify the organization, we must first rectify the ideology, and carry out a struggle between proletarian and non-proletarian ideologies." The same applies to the rectification of the party's organization and ideological construction. To strengthen party building, we must focus on class struggle and emphasize politics. If we only focus on production points and do not first focus on political points; if we only focus on production models and do not first focus on political models, we are essentially cultivating capitalist points and revisionist points. This is a serious issue of the struggle between two lines. The points we cultivate must be socialist points, and they must be points that hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

In our county, the Longhu Commune Victory Brigade was originally quite backward. County committee leaders stayed there for half a year, consistently working half a day and studying half a day, focusing on the study of Chairman Mao's works by party members, cadres, and the masses, and carrying out a struggle between proletarian and bourgeois ideologies within and outside the party. They organized everyone to repeatedly study "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and other works by Chairman Mao. The class consciousness of party members, cadres, and the masses was raised, and many people had the image of heroes like Zhang Side and Norman Bethune in their hearts. They established a spirit of overcoming difficulties and self-reliance and resolutely fought against the spontaneous capitalist forces. This spring, the state supported this brigade with 50,000 pounds of fertilizer. The brigade party and the community members did not accept it and sent the fertilizer to other difficult brigades. They themselves dried up a lake and took a large amount of silt to solve the fertilizer problem. With the improvement of political awareness, production also improved.

The facts of Victory Brigade made the county committee further realize that grassroots branches must focus on politics and hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought to gradually achieve revolutionization. Grassroots branches are on the front line of class struggle. Only by building the branches well with Mao Zedong Thought can they better shoulder the responsibility of leading the masses in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment.

### 蹲突出政治的点

　　蹲突出政治的点
　　湖北省孝感县委副书记　唐清波
    我们县委的同志，经常到基层支部去蹲点。根据我们的体会，蹲点有不同的蹲法。是蹲生产的点，还是蹲突出政治的点？效果大不一样。
    过去，我们只抓生产，不抓政治，不抓阶级斗争。县委只把生产看成中心工作，县委书记也就成了农业、林业、水利等局的局长，对党的建设却很少过问。群众批评县委领导“光抓锄头，不抓人头”，“只抓粮棉油，不抓敌我友”。在这种思想指导下，我们到基层支部蹲点，就不是蹲突出政治的点，而是蹲突出生产的点。于是，支援点上的人力多了，钱也多了，物资也多了。群众说，“这样的点，只能看，不能学。”
    我们认真学习毛主席的建党思想以后，认识有了很大提高。毛主席说：“我们的党，我们的队伍，虽然其中的大部分是纯洁的，但是为要领导革命运动更好地发展，更快地完成，就必须从思想上组织上认真地整顿一番。而为要从组织上整顿，首先需要在思想上整顿，需要展开一个无产阶级对非无产阶级的思想斗争。”整顿党的组织是如此，党的思想建设也是如此。要加强党的建设，必须抓阶级斗争，抓突出政治。如果只抓生产的点，不首先抓政治的点；只抓生产的样板，不首先抓政治的样板，实质上是在培养资本主义的点，培养修正主义的点。这是两条道路斗争的严重问题。我们培养的点，必须是社会主义的点，必须是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的点。
    我们县长湖公社胜利大队，原来比较落后，县委领导同志在那里蹲点半年，一直坚持半天劳动、半天工作，狠抓党员、干部、群众对毛主席著作的学习，在党内外开展无产阶级思想对资产阶级思想的斗争。组织大家反复学习《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》《愚公移山》和毛主席的其他著作，党员、干部和群众的阶级觉悟提高了，许多人的心中都有了张思德、白求恩的英雄形象，树立起克服困难、自力更生的精神，坚决同资本主义自发势力作斗争。今年春天，国家支援了这个大队五万斤肥料。胜利大队的支部和社员群众，没有接受，把肥料送给了别的困难队。他们自己戽干了一个湖，取了大量塘泥，解决了肥料问题。大家政治觉悟提高了，生产也就搞得好起来。
    胜利大队的事实，使县委进一步认识到，基层支部必须突出政治，必须高举毛泽东思想红旗，才能逐步实现革命化。基层支部站在阶级斗争的最前线，只有用毛泽东思想把支部建设好，才能更好地担负起领导群众进行阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动的任务。
