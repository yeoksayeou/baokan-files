Albanian "Unity" and Australian "Vanguard" Newspapers Condemn Soviet Revisionists' Collaboration with the U.S., Japan, and India Against China

The Soviet Revisionists Adopt a Policy of Capitulation in Europe and Actively Assist U.S. Imperialism in Its Aggression Against Vietnam and China

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Tirana, the editorial department of the Albanian newspaper "Unity" published an article on August 5th condemning the Khrushchev revisionists for serving the big conspiracy of "bombing for peace" promoted by the American aggressors.

The article points out that Moscow has become the center of this conspiracy. The visits of Mrs. Gandhi, Wilson, and U Thant to Moscow are aimed at urging the Khrushchev revisionists to take more active actions, putting pressure on the Vietnamese people, and attempting to force Vietnam to surrender and accept "peace talks."

The article emphasizes that Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to the Nation" and the partial mobilization order, as well as the decisions of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the communiqué of the Supreme Defense Council, are very important documents. They express the will and unshakable determination of the Vietnamese people. All progressive humanity and revolutionary forces fighting against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys welcome this call to battle.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Melbourne, the Australian newspaper "Vanguard" published an article on August 4th exposing how the Soviet revisionist leadership is doing everything possible to serve the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam and to oppose China.

"The Vanguard" strongly condemns the Soviet revisionist leadership for adopting a policy of capitulation in Europe to facilitate the U.S. strategic shift to the East. It says, "At this critical moment in the Vietnam War, when U.S. imperialism is bogged down, the Soviet revisionist leadership has reached an understanding with U.S. imperialism, allowing it to withdraw tens of thousands of troops from Western Europe and send them to the Pacific region."

"The Vanguard" points out that at the same time, the statement issued by the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Pact countries, which met in Bucharest from July 4th to 6th, "from the perspective of U.S.-Soviet collusion," emphasizes taking constructive measures to "strengthen peace and security in Europe," believing that this can be achieved by convening a pan-European conference. It points out: "The Soviet revisionist leadership hypocritically calls for 'joint action' to help Vietnam, but what they are doing is undermining the united front against U.S. imperialism."

"The Vanguard" also exposes that the Soviet revisionists are intensifying their collusion with Japanese reactionaries to serve U.S. imperialism. It points out that Japan has long been the main supply base for U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam, "but the Soviet revisionist leadership is busy conducting secret negotiations with Japanese imperialists, and these negotiations revolve around the central concept of 'containing' the People's Republic of China."

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Ottawa, the August issue of "Progressive Worker," the organ of the Canadian "Progressive Workers' Movement," published an article fiercely attacking the Soviet revisionists for colluding with U.S. imperialism and plotting to betray the just struggle of the Vietnamese people. The "Progressive Workers' Movement" solemnly declares in the article that everyone must fight against the deception and betrayal of the revisionists centered on the Soviet revisionist group.

The article emphasizes the need to expose the hypocritical nature of the modern revisionists' calls for "unity against imperialism." The article says that this is actually a call to unite with imperialism, because "they threaten that if they refuse their policy of 'peaceful coexistence' with imperialism, they will face nuclear annihilation. They are vigorously promoting Johnson's 'peace hoax' and 'unconditional negotiations.'"

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Paris, the Central Committee Secretariat of the French Communist Movement (Marxist-Leninist) recently issued a statement condemning the U.S. for expanding its dirty war of aggression against Vietnam and emphasizing that the Soviet revisionist leaders are accomplices of U.S. imperialism.

The statement says: "Johnson desperately tries to use terror to force the Vietnamese people to submit to his will, to give up their just struggle for the independence and sovereignty of their country, and to accept his 'peace talks' that allow U.S. troops to occupy South Vietnam, so as to turn South Vietnam into a powerful base for invading other countries in the Indochina Peninsula, the People's Republic of China, and other Asian countries."

The statement also condemns the Soviet revisionist leadership for adopting a policy of capitulation on the European issue.

    苏修勾结美日印反华苏修集团在欧洲采取投降主义政策
    在亚洲积极充当美帝侵越反华帮凶
    据新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》五日发表编辑部文章谴责赫鲁晓夫修正主义者为美国侵略者推行的“以炸迫和”的大阴谋效劳。
    文章指出，莫斯科变成了华盛顿这一阴谋的中心。甘地夫人、威尔逊和吴丹等人访问莫斯科，就是要促使赫鲁晓夫修正主义者更积极地行动，对越南人民施加压力，妄图迫使越南投降，接受“和谈”。
    文章强调指出，胡志明主席发表的《告全国同胞书》和局部动员令以及越南民主共和国国会常务委员会的决定和最高国防会议的公报是十分重要的文件。它表达了越南人民的意志和不可动摇的决心。全体进步人类和正在同美帝国主义及其走狗进行针锋相对斗争的革命力量欢迎这一战斗号召。
    据新华社墨尔本电　澳大利亚《先锋报》四日发表文章，揭露苏联修正主义领导集团千方百计地为美帝国主义扩大侵略越南的战争和反对中国的阴谋服务。
    《先锋报》强烈谴责苏联修正主义领导集团在欧洲采取投降主义政策，以便利美国战略重点东移。它说，
  “现在，在越南战争的这个严重的时刻，在美帝国主义正陷入泥沼的时候”，苏联修正主义领导集团却同美帝国主义达成默契，使美帝国主义可以从西欧抽走数万名军队，而派往太平洋地区。
    《先锋报》说，在这同时，七月四日到六日在布加勒斯特召开的华沙条约缔约国政治协商委员会会议发表的声明，竟“从美苏勾结的观点出发”，“大讲采取建设性措施去‘加强欧洲的和平和安全’，认为可以通过召开泛欧会议来实现这一点”。它指出：“苏联修正主义领导集团嘴上伪善地号召采取‘联合行动’来帮助越南，而干的却是破坏反对美帝国主义的统一战线。”
    《先锋报》还揭露，苏联修正主义者正在加紧勾结日本反动派共同为美帝国主义效劳。它指出，日本早已成为美帝国主义侵略越南战争的主要供应基地，“可是苏联修正主义领导集团却忙于和日本帝国主义分子进行秘密谈判，而这些谈判是围绕着‘遏制’人民中国这个中心概念的。”
    据新华社渥太华电　加拿大“进步工人运动”的机关刊物《进步工人》月刊八月号发表了一篇文章，猛烈抨击苏联修正主义者同美帝国主义勾结，阴谋出卖越南人民正义斗争的无耻勾当。“进步工人运动”在文章中庄严宣布：大家必须同以苏联修正主义集团为中心的修正主义者的欺骗和背叛行为作斗争。
    文章强调，目前十分有必要揭露现代修正主义者关于“团结反帝”叫嚷的伪善实质。文章说，这事实上是要求大家同帝国主义“团结”，因为“他们威胁说，如果拒绝他们的同帝国主义‘和平共处’的方针就要遭到核毁灭，他们卖力地推行约翰逊的‘和平骗局’和‘无条件谈判’”。
    据新华社巴黎电　法国共产主义运动（马克思列宁主义）中央委员会书记处最近发表声明，谴责美国扩大侵略越南的肮脏战争，并且强调指出，苏联修正主义领导人是美帝国主义的帮凶。
    声明说：“约翰逊绝望地企图用恐怖来迫使越南人民屈服于他的意志，放弃为祖国的独立和主权而进行的正义斗争，接受他的使美国军队得以占领南越的‘和平谈判’，以便把南越变成一个对印度支那半岛其他国家、对中华人民共和国和亚洲其他国家进行侵略的强大基地。”
    声明还谴责苏联修正主义领导集团在欧洲问题上采取投降主义政策。
