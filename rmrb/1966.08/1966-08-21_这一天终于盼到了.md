The day we have been waiting for finally arrived.
The sun shines on Tiananmen Gate,
People rejoice on Chang'an Avenue.
Through tears, we see him,
Chairman Mao smiling at us.
We think of him every day, we long for him every night,
The day we have been waiting for finally arrived.
"Long live Chairman Mao!" our hearts beat with joy.
Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao,
Your heart beats as one with the people's.
We will forever follow you in revolution,
Unshaken in the midst of storms!

  这一天终于盼到了
  天安门上阳光照，
  长安街头人欢跃。
  透过泪花看到了，
  毛主席望着咱们笑。
  天天想，夜夜盼，
  这一天终于盼到了。
  “万岁万岁毛主席！”
  颗颗红心往外跳。
  毛主席呀毛主席，
  您与群众心一条。
  永远跟您干革命，
  大风浪中不动摇！
  北京第二外国语学院学生  方占岐
