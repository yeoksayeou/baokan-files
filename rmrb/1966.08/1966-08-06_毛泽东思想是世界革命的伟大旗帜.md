Hanoi's *New Vietnam-China News* Publishes Article Saying People of Five Continents Look to New China as Their Future

Mao Zedong Thought is the Great Banner of the World Revolution

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China Will Make Extremely Important Contributions to the International Proletarian Revolution

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on August 4, the July 31 issue of Hanoi's *New Vietnam-China News* published an article by a Vietnamese comrade named Shi Bi, which enthusiastically praises Chairman Mao Zedong as the most brilliant and outstanding Marxist-Leninist fighter of our time. The article states that Mao Zedong Thought is a shining beacon for the current Asian, African, Latin American, and international communist movements.

The article, titled "The Chinese Communist Party—The Great Vanguard of the International Communist Movement," was written to commemorate the 45th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party.

The article points out that the achievements of the construction of New China have brought boundless joy and encouragement to the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, as well as to friends on the five continents. They yearn for New China and regard it as their goal of struggle, seeing today's China as their own future.

The article points out that the Chinese Communist Party's wholehearted support for the Vietnamese people not only brings new strength and greater confidence to the Vietnamese people, enabling them to decisively defeat the American aggressors and their puppet and traitorous clique, and strive for national independence and reunification, but also greatly inspires the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. They increasingly rely on China as a solid backbone. Only true Marxist-Leninists are resolute revolutionaries who oppose American imperialism, while modern revisionism compromises with American imperialism and is a traitor obstructing the advance of the revolutionary cause. Although the struggle against modern revisionism is long and arduous, the Chinese Communist Party—the defender of Marxism-Leninism and truth, and the true Marxist-Leninists of the world—will surely achieve complete victory.

The article states that the history of the Chinese Communist Party is closely linked with the name of Chairman Mao Zedong. Chairman Mao Zedong is the most brilliant and outstanding Marxist-Leninist fighter of our time. He possesses an iron will of revolution, a crystal-clear class sentiment, and a brilliant mind that shines like a lighthouse. Chairman Mao Zedong's works transcend national boundaries and have become great masterpieces in the treasury of world revolutionary classics. Chairman Mao Zedong has taken up the revolutionary torch passed down by Marx and Lenin, illuminating the path forward for the revolutionary peoples of the world and the national liberation revolutions in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

The article states that under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution unfolding across China is an objective necessity for the deepening of the socialist revolution. It is the most profound and thorough cultural and ideological revolution in human history. All true revolutionaries are eagerly awaiting the glorious victory of this revolution. The precious experience of this cultural and ideological revolution—which has never been seen in past revolutionary practices—will make extremely important contributions to enriching the theoretical treasury of the international proletarian revolution.

    河内《新越华报》载文说五大洲人民把新中国当作自己的明天
    毛泽东思想是世界革命的伟大旗帜
    中国文化大革命将对国际无产阶级革命作出极其重要的贡献
    据新华社河内四日电　河内《新越华报》七月三十一日刊登了一篇署名石壁的越南同志所写的文章，热烈赞扬毛泽东主席是当代最天才、最卓越的马克思列宁主义战士，毛泽东思想是当前亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和国际共产主义运动的一面光辉灿烂的伟大旗帜。
    这篇题为《中国共产党——国际共产主义运动的伟大旗手》的文章，是为了纪念中国共产党成立四十五周年而写的。
    文章指出，新中国的建设成就使得亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲民族解放运动以及五大洲的朋友们无限欢欣鼓舞。他们向往着新中国并且把新中国当作自己奋斗的目标，他们把今天的中国作为他们自己的明天。
    文章指出，中国共产党对越南人民的全心全意的支持，不仅给越南人民带来新的力量，更加信心百倍，坚决打败美国侵略者及其走狗卖国集团，争取祖国的独立和统一，而且还有力地鼓舞着亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族解放运动，他们更加信赖地把中国看做是自己稳固的靠山。只有真正的马克思列宁主义者才是坚决地反对美帝国主义的革命者，而现代修正主义却同美帝国主义妥协，是阻碍革命车轮前进的叛徒。尽管反对现代修正主义的斗争是长期、艰苦的，但是中国共产党——马克思列宁主义和真理的捍卫者和全世界的真正马克思列宁主义者必将取得完全胜利。
    文章说，中国共产党的历史是与毛泽东主席的名字连在一起的。毛泽东主席是当代最天才、最卓越的马克思列宁主义战士，他有着钢铁般坚强的革命意志，有着水晶般晶莹清澈的阶级感情，有着灯塔般光芒四射的英明头脑。毛泽东主席的著作超越了国家界限，成为世界革命经典著作宝库中的伟大作品。毛泽东主席接过了马克思、列宁手中的革命火炬，照亮了全世界革命人民和亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族解放革命的前进道路。
    文章说，在毛泽东主席的亲自领导下，中国共产党在全国范围内展开的文化大革命是社会主义革命深入发展的客观必然规律，它是人类历史上一次最深刻、最彻底的波澜壮阔的文化思想大革命。真正的革命者都在兴奋地期待着这场革命的辉煌胜利。这次文化思想大革命的宝贵经验——这是过去的革命实践从未有过的——将为丰富国际无产阶级革命的理论宝库作出极其重要的贡献。
