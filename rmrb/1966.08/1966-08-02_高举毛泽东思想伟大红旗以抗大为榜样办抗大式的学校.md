What kind of schools should our army establish? What are the most important issues to address in running a good school? Our answer is: Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University (Anti-JU) as an example, inherit and carry forward the fine traditions of the Anti-JU, and establish schools in the style of the Anti-JU.

The Anti-JU was renowned worldwide because it trained a large number of cadres who, at any time and in any place, even in extremely difficult circumstances, could adhere to the Party's policies, overcome all difficulties, and struggle unyieldingly to the end. It successfully fulfilled the historical mission assigned to it by the War of Resistance Against Japan. Chairman Mao said that the revolution and progress of the Anti-JU were due to the fact that its staff, teachers, and curriculum were revolutionary and progressive. Without these two aspects of revolution and progress, the Anti-JU could not have become a school praised by the revolutionary people at home and abroad. Now, when we run schools, we should take the Anti-JU as an example and establish schools in the style of the Anti-JU. Only in this way can we train a large number of strong revolutionary cadres, train a large number of successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution, meet the needs of military and national defense construction, defeat the aggression of American imperialism, foil the conspiracies and sabotage of modern revisionism, greatly strengthen our national defense forces, and continuously advance our revolutionary cause. All military academies must inherit and carry forward the revolutionary spirit and glorious traditions of the Anti-JU and strive forward to the goal of "schools in the style of the Anti-JU."

The core of the glorious traditions of the Anti-JU is to emphasize politics, implement political leadership, and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide all work, arm a wide range of cadres with Mao Zedong Thought, and run schools with Mao Zedong Thought. Specifically, the main points are:

	(1) Have the correct policy. In the early days of the Anti-JU, Chairman Mao set the general educational policy for the Anti-JU: "Firm and correct political direction, hardworking and plain working style, flexible and mobile strategy and tactics." Chairman Mao said that these three aspects are indispensable for cultivating a revolutionary soldier. The Anti-JU was run according to this policy. The staff, teachers, and students of the Anti-JU all conducted education and learning according to this policy. Chairman Mao had strict requirements for the Anti-JU. He said that after graduating from the Anti-JU, one must overcome difficulties, connect with the masses, and carry forward the spirit of hard struggle. If one is corrupt and lazy and does not work hard, one is not a student of the Anti-JU and has betrayed the discipline of the Anti-JU. He also told the graduates of the second term of the Anti-JU: "Be brave, firm, and calm. Learn from struggle. Be ready to sacrifice everything for the cause of national liberation at any time!" In addition to emphasizing the study of politics and military affairs, Chairman Mao especially emphasized the importance of production. When the Anti-JU launched the production movement, he wrote the following for the Anti-JU: "Study while working, overcome difficulties, and make the enemy lose heart." He also instructed: "Now study while working, and in the future fight while working." These are the policies for running the Anti-JU, which have been tested and proven to be the only correct policies. It is precisely because these policies were seriously implemented that the Anti-JU became a very revolutionary and progressive school.

	(2) Have a strong leadership. The Anti-JU was established under the direct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Military Commission. Chairman Mao personally served as the chairman of the Anti-JU Education Committee, often participated in school activities, gave lectures, and made reports, providing many extremely important instructions for the construction of the Anti-JU. He also showed great care for the teaching and learning staff of the Anti-JU. Comrades such as Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping from the Central Committee also gave important instructions to the Anti-JU and personally gave lectures and made reports. The Central Committee appointed Comrade Lin Biao as the president and political commissar. He was both a leader, a teacher, and a student, embodying the three-in-one combination. He truly practiced teaching while learning, being both a teacher and a student. His leadership was revolutionary. He held the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought highest and was one of the most outstanding representatives of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in practice. He went deep into reality and connected with the masses, setting a good example for us to learn from.

	(3) Have a good school spirit. The school spirit of the Anti-JU is unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness. These eight characters of school spirit were summarized and generalized by Chairman Mao in the actual struggle since the founding of the army, and Comrade Lin Biao insisted on and carried forward this spirit. Comrade Lin Biao said that to complete our glorious and great revolutionary tasks, we must unite closely. We must work in a swift and decisive manner, we must follow discipline, be serious, and at the same time be lively. These eight characters, combined with the three sentences of the educational policy of the Anti-JU mentioned earlier, constitute the three-eight spirit of our army.

	(4) Center on political education. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao pointed out that all work at the Anti-JU was for the purpose of transforming the students' thoughts, and political education was the central link. They emphasized the study of Marxism-Leninism, the Party's line and policies, and strengthened class education and Party education, strengthened ideological and political training, and educated the students to approach the workers and peasants and be determined to serve the workers and peasants. The Anti-JU used the works of Chairman Mao as the basic textbooks to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism that was brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited and developed in the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards worldwide victory. Studying Mao Zedong Thought is the shortcut to studying Marxism-Leninism. The education in our academies must use the works of Chairman Mao as the basic textbooks, place the study and propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought in the first position in all work, and truly master Mao Zedong Thought.

	(5) Combine theory with practice. Based on the instructions of the Central Committee and practical experience, Comrade Lin Biao took combining theory with practice as the fundamental teaching principle of the Anti-JU. The experience of the Anti-JU proves that to temper our cadres into strong cadres, it is not enough to just study a few books. We must put our cadres in the great crucible of the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation, temper them through countless trials and tribulations, and temper them into strong cadres. Knowledge and theory must be combined with struggle, labor, and practice. Only by combining theory with practice can it bloom and bear fruit; otherwise, theory is empty.

	(6) Few but excellent courses. Comrade Lin Biao took few but excellent courses as the most important principle for formulating the educational plan of the Anti-JU. He pointed out that the educational plan should be formulated based on needs and possibilities. That is, our educational plan should be formulated based on the regulations of the Central Committee and the Military Commission, the needs of students' future work, the students' original level, and the school's equipment conditions. Otherwise, it will be detached from reality. He has always advocated that we must focus on the key points and be willing to cut out the secondary things. Otherwise, if we want to learn many subjects and be comprehensive, the result will be the opposite, and we will learn very little. Now, when we run schools, we should carefully study the curriculum setting and teaching content, and seriously solve them according to the principle of few but excellent courses.

	(7) Short school term. The school term of the Anti-JU was generally six to eight months. It is necessary to stay in school to read some books, but the time should not be too long. If the time is too long, the more one studies, the more empty one becomes, and one becomes detached from reality. Cadres are mainly cultivated and improved in revolutionary struggle practice.

	(8) Vivid and lively teaching methods. Comrade Lin Biao advocated the mass line, collective research, mutual learning and help in teaching methods, and combined the inspirational, research, and experimental methods. Teachers first inspire students, and after students are inspired, they read books and reference books, conduct research, and then conduct experiments to prove whether the theory is correct and deepen their understanding of the theory. The teaching methods of the Anti-JU are very vivid and lively and are our examples to learn from.

	(9) Revolutionize the teaching staff. The Anti-JU paid great attention to the construction of the teaching staff. Comrade Lin Biao thought of many ways to improve the political awareness and professional level of the teachers, such as setting up teacher training teams, holding cadre discussion meetings, strengthening political education for teachers, strengthening Party life, and caring for their work and life, so that all teachers are loyal to the Party's educational cause. The enthusiasm of the teachers was brought into play, and they worked hard to study and improve their teaching work.

	(10) Self-reliance and thrift in running the school. The students and teachers of the Anti-JU dug caves themselves to solve the accommodation problem and produced by themselves to solve the living difficulties. This is also a glorious tradition of the Anti-JU, and we must not abandon it.

The glorious traditions of the Anti-JU can be listed in many ways, but the most important ones are these ten. These ten experiences are not listed in parallel; they have a center. What is the center? It is to run schools according to Mao Zedong Thought, to emphasize politics. Since the founding of the army, Chairman Mao has emphasized the Party's leadership over the army, established and strengthened political work in the army, strengthened the construction of the Party in the army, emphasized the nature of the people's army, opposed the purely military viewpoint, and opposed militarism. The famous Gutian Conference solved many problems, and the most central problem was solving the problem of military subordination to politics. This is the fundamental experience of our army's construction over the past few decades, and our academies must resolutely implement it.

After national victory, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, in light of the development of the situation, put forward a series of important instructions for the education revolution, such as making the educated develop in terms of ideology, intelligence, and physical education, becoming socially conscious laborers with culture; serving proletarian politics with education, combining education with productive labor; and cultivating and training successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. Our military academies must, like the Anti-JU, resolutely implement the educational line of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Only in this way can we truly establish schools in the style of the Anti-JU.

The Military Commission and Comrade Lin Biao called on the entire army to adhere to Mao Zedong Thought as the guideline in all work, study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, insist on the Four Firsts, carry forward the Three-Eights spirit, develop the Three Democracies, and launch the Four Good Units movement. They instructed us to "definitely master Mao Zedong Thought," "make the study of Chairman Mao's works the most fundamental compulsory course," and "definitely emphasize politics and make political and ideological work truly the foundation of our entire work." These are the most fundamental things in the construction of our army and are also the most fundamental things in running our academies well. Only by resolutely implementing these policies and principles can our academies be as revolutionary and progressive as the Anti-JU.

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗以抗大为榜样办抗大式的学校
    一九六五年七月在解放军全军院校政治教育改革会议上讲话的部分摘要
    叶剑英
    我们军队究竟要办什么样的学校？办好一个学校，最重要的要解决哪些问题？对这个问题，我们的回答是：高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以抗大为榜样，继承和发扬抗大的优良作风，办抗大式的学校。
    当时抗大之所以在全世界闻名，就是因为它培养出了大批能在任何时候、任何地方、甚至在极端困难的环境中，坚持党的方针，克服一切困难，不屈不挠奋斗到底的坚强的革命干部。它很好地完成了抗日战争所赋予它的历史任务。毛主席说，抗大的革命和进步，是因为它的职员、教员和课程是革命的，进步的。没有这两方面的革命性，进步性，抗大绝不能成为一个被国内外革命人民所称赞的学校。我们现在办学校，就是要以抗大作榜样，办抗大式的学校。只有这样，才能培养出大批坚强的革命干部，培养出大批无产阶级革命事业的接班人，满足军队建设和国防建设的需要，才能战胜美帝国主义对我们的侵略，粉碎现代修正主义对我们的阴谋破坏，把我们的国防力量大大加强，把我们的革命事业不断地推向前进。全军院校一定要继承和发扬抗大的革命精神和光荣传统，向“抗大式的学校”这个目标奋勇前进。
    抗大的光荣传统，最核心的东西就是突出政治，实行政治挂帅，用毛泽东思想统帅一切工作，用毛泽东思想武装广大干部，用毛泽东思想办学校。具体说来，主要是：
      （一）有正确的方针。抗大创建初期，毛主席为抗大规定的总的教育方针是：“坚定正确的政治方向，艰苦朴素的工作作风，灵活机动的战略战术。”毛主席说，这三者是造就一个革命军人所不可缺少的。抗大就是根据这个方针来办的。抗大的职员、教员、学员都是根据这个方针进行教育和从事学习的。毛主席对抗大有很严格的要求。他说，抗大同学毕业后，要克服困难，联系群众，发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，谁要贪污腐败不努力工作，那便不成为抗大的学生，就是背叛了抗大的纪律。他还对抗大二期的毕业生说：你们要“勇敢、坚定、沉着。向斗争中学习。为民族解放事业随时准备牺牲自己的一切！”毛主席除了强调学习政治、军事以外，还特别强调搞好生产。在抗大开展生产运动的时候，他给抗大的题词是：“一面学习，一面生产，克服困难，敌人丧胆。”他又指示：“现在一面学习，一面生产，将来一面作战，一面生产”，这些就是抗大的办校方针，是经过了实践检验的唯一正确的方针。正是因为认真贯彻执行这条方针，抗大就成了非常革命、非常进步的学校。
      （二）有坚强的领导。抗大是在党中央和军委的直接领导下创办的。毛主席亲自担任抗大教育委员会的主席，经常参加学校的活动，亲自讲课，作报告，对抗大的建设作了很多极为重要的指示，对抗大的教职学员，给了亲切的无微不至的关怀。刘少奇、周恩来、邓小平等中央领导同志，也都对抗大作过重要的指示，亲自给抗大讲课、作报告。中央派林彪同志担任校长兼政委。他既是领导，又是教员，又是学员，是三结合的。他真正做到了一面教，一面学，一面当先生，一面当学生。他的领导是革命化的领导。他把毛泽东思想红旗举得最高，是活学活用毛泽东思想最杰出的代表之一。他深入实际，联系群众，是我们学习的好榜样。
      （三）有优良的校风。抗大的校风就是团结、紧张、严肃、活泼。这八个字的校风，是建军以来，在实际斗争中，毛主席概括总结出来的，林彪同志坚持并发扬了这个作风。林彪同志讲，为了完成我们光荣伟大的革命任务，要紧密地团结起来，我们要用雷厉风行的作风，紧张地工作，我们要遵守纪律，要有严肃性，同时又要活泼。这八个字，加上前边讲的抗大的教育方针那三句话，就构成了我军的三八作风。
      （四）以政治教育为中心。党中央、毛主席指出，抗大一切工作都是为了转变学生的思想，政治教育是中心的一环。强调学习马克思列宁主义，学习党的路线政策，强调加强阶级教育和党的教育，加强思想意识锻炼，教育他们接近工农，决心为工农服务。抗大是以毛主席的著作为基本教材，学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的。毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃、社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代，天才地、创造性地、全面地继承和发展了的马克思列宁主义。学习毛泽东思想，是学习马克思列宁主义的捷径。我们院校的教育，都必须以毛主席著作为基本教材，把学习和宣传毛泽东思想，放在一切工作的首位，把毛泽东思想真正学到手。
      （五）理论联系实际。林彪同志根据中央的指示和实践经验，把理论联系实际作为抗大的根本的教学原则。抗大的经验证明，要把我军干部锻炼成坚强的干部，不是光学几本书就行了。要把我们的干部放在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三项伟大革命运动的大熔炉里，千锤百炼，敲敲打打，锻炼成为坚强的干部。知识和理论，要同斗争结合，同劳动结合，同实际结合。理论同实践结合起来，才能开花结果，不然理论就是空的。
      （六）教学内容少而精。林彪同志把少而精作为抗大制定教育计划的最重要的原则。他指出要根据需要和可能来制定教育计划。就是我们的教育计划，要根据中央和军委的规定，根据学生将来出去工作的需要，根据学生原有的程度，根据学校的设备条件来制定，不这样就会脱离实际。他历来主张一定要突出重点，舍得砍去那些次要的东西。不然，想学许多课目，想什么都学的完备，但是结果相反，学到的东西却很少。我们现在办学校，课程设置和教学内容，都要好好研究一下，根据少而精的原则，认真加以解决。
      （七）学制短。抗大的学制，一般为六到八个月。住学校读点书是必要的，但时间不能太长，时间长了，就会越学越空，脱离实际。干部主要靠在革命斗争的实践中培养提高。
      （八）教学方法生动活泼。林彪同志提倡群众路线，集体研究，教学相长，互相帮助的教学方法，启发式，研究式，实验式相结合。教员先启发学生，学生受了启发之后看本本，看参考书，经过一番研究，再去实验，用实验结果来证明理论是否正确，加深对理论的理解。抗大的教学方法，非常生动活泼，是我们学习的榜样。
      （九）教员队伍革命化。抗大很重视教员队伍的建设。林彪同志想了很多办法来提高教员的政治觉悟和业务水平，如办教员训练队，举行干部讨论会，加强对教员的政治教育，加强党的生活，关怀他们的工作和生活，使全体教员忠诚于党的教育事业。教员的积极性发挥起来了，他们就努力钻研，教学工作也就搞好了。
      （十）自力更生，勤俭办校。抗大师生自己动手挖窑洞，解决住宿问题，自己生产，解决生活上的困难。这也是抗大的光荣传统，我们千万不能丢掉。
    抗大的光荣传统还可以列许多条，但最主要的有这么十条。十条经验也不是平列的，它有个中心。中心是什么？就是按照毛泽东思想来办学校，就是要突出政治。毛主席从建军起，就狠抓党对军队的领导，建立和加强军队中的政治工作，抓军队中党的建设，强调人民军队的本质，反对单纯军事观点，反对军阀主义。有名的古田会议，解决了很多问题，最中心的问题，就是解决了军事要服从政治的问题。这是我军几十年来建设的根本经验，我们院校必须坚决贯彻执行。
    全国胜利后，党中央、毛主席根据形势的发展，在教育工作上提出使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者；教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合；培养和造就无产阶级革命事业接班人等一系列教育方针，对教育革命作了许多极为重要的指示。我们军队院校必须象抗大那样，坚决执行党中央和毛主席的教育路线，只有这样，才能真正办成抗大式的学校。
    军委和林彪同志，号召全军在各项工作中坚持以毛泽东思想为指针，活学活用毛主席著作，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，发扬三大民主，开展四好连队运动。指示我们“一定要把毛泽东思想真正学到手”，“使毛主席著作的学习成为最根本的必修课”，“一定要突出政治，使政治思想工作真正成为我们全盘工作的基础”。这些都是我军建设最根本性的东西，也是我们办好院校的最根本的东西。只有坚决贯彻执行这些方针原则，我们的院校才能办得象抗大那样最革命，最进步。
