People from Laos, Japan, Algeria, Azania (South Africa), Somalia, and Mexico have warmly praised Chairman Mao's wise judgment that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers.

The Lao People's Revolutionary Party representative in Vientiane, Tao Su Bounlert, recently told a Xinhua News Agency reporter: "Imperialism and all reactionaries appear strong and ferocious, but in essence, they are weak. The experience of the Lao people's struggle proves that U.S. imperialism is a bully. If we dare to fight it head-on and retaliate, it will suffer continuous defeats and fall into difficulties. It is under the inspiration of Chairman Mao Zedong's wise judgment that the Lao people have bravely waged a long-term struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism and have achieved continuous victories."

The president of the Japanese Journalists Association, Kobayashi Yuichi, pointed out that Chairman Mao's famous judgment "greatly encouraged the Japanese people and the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to oppose U.S. imperialism's occupation of Japan, to oppose U.S. imperialism's rule and oppression, and to struggle for true independence." He said, "Chairman Mao's words have shown us the direction of historical progress and have given the people of the world increased confidence and spiritual strength to defeat imperialism."

Kobayashi, when discussing the Soviet leadership's attitude towards the Vietnam issue, said, "They are cursing the U.S. imperialists while helping them in Vietnam."

Japanese famous commentator Matsuoka Yozo pointed out that in the past twenty years, more and more people in Asia, Africa, and other regions have seen through the true nature of U.S. imperialism as a paper tiger. "This is a remarkable thing." She said, "When the people in struggle combine Mao Zedong Thought with their struggle, they will draw courage and strength from it."

Japanese Socialist Party Diet member Hokusoku Kei said, "The law of history is stern. Thirty years ago, the Japanese militarists were once invincible, but they eventually collapsed like a paper tiger."

Hokusoku pointed out that today, U.S. imperialism is also a paper tiger. It is nothing to be afraid of.

The president of the Japan Stamp Collectors Association, Mizuhara Akari, said, "Since we have understood the truth that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers, we have become revolutionary optimists in our struggle against U.S. imperialism."

He condemned some people who opposed Chairman Mao's wise judgment and colluded with revisionists to carry out some "joint actions." He pointed out that the revolutionary people of the world must not carry out "joint actions" with revisionists who are closely cooperating with U.S. imperialism.

An Algerian student said, "During our national liberation war, the French colonizers seemed strong, but in a few years, they were defeated and driven away by us. Isn't this proof of the correctness of Chairman Mao Zedong's judgment?"

The representative of the Pan-Africanist Congress in Algiers, Mokone, recently told a Xinhua News Agency reporter that the people of Azania, who are fighting for independence, admire Mao Zedong Thought and believe that, according to Chairman Mao's judgment, they will ultimately be able to smash the reactionary Verwoerd fascist regime and its allies led by U.S. imperialism.

The chairman of the Somali Agricultural Cooperative Organization, Ibrahim Adan Farah, recently wrote in an article that Chairman Mao teaches us that imperialism is a paper tiger. "We will follow the teachings of the greatest leader in the world, Chairman Mao Zedong, and give imperialists a hard blow! We will loyally follow Chairman Mao Zedong and be faithful to his teachings."

Mexican famous social activist Estrella Chapa said that Chairman Mao's judgment is an unparalleled ideological weapon. Once the people of Latin America grasp this weapon, they will fear nothing, march forward forever, and engage in a life-and-death struggle with U.S. imperialism to achieve final victory.

Mexican famous economist Alonso Aguilar praised Chairman Mao's judgment, saying that the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the current surge of revolutionary movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have struck and are striking at imperialism, old and new colonialism, and all reactionaries. All this fully proves that Chairman Mao's judgment is extremely correct and wise.

Two Mexican students told a Xinhua News Agency reporter, "Against imperialism, as long as we dare to fight, we will ultimately achieve victory, although the struggle is sometimes arduous and tortuous. But after all, a paper tiger is a paper tiger."

    亚非拉人士热烈赞颂毛主席关于纸老虎的英明论断
    听从毛主席教导　狠揍美国纸老虎
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：老挝、日本、阿尔及利亚、阿扎尼亚（南非）、索马里和墨西哥等国各界人士热烈赞颂毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断。
    老挝爱国战线党驻万象代表陶苏·培拉西最近向新华社记者发表谈话说：“帝国主义和一切反动派貌似强大，是凶恶的，但是实质上是虚弱的。老挝人民的斗争经验证明，美帝国主义是欺软怕硬的。如果我们敢于对它进行针锋相对和以牙还牙的斗争，它必将不断地遭到失败，从而陷入困境。老挝人民正是在毛泽东主席这一英明论断的鼓舞之下，英勇地进行了抗击帝国主义和新老殖民主义的长期斗争，并且不断取得胜利。”
    日本记者会议议长小林雄一指出，毛主席的著名论断，“大大地鼓舞了日本人民和亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民反对美帝国主义霸占日本，反对美帝国主义统治、压迫，争取真正独立的斗争。”他说，“毛主席的话，给我们指出了历史前进的方向，给世界人民增强了战胜帝国主义的信心和精神力量。”
    小林在谈到苏联领导集团对越南问题的态度时说，“它们在越南问题上对美帝国主义是小骂大帮忙”。
      日本著名评论家松冈洋子指出，在短短的二十年中间，亚洲、非洲等地区有越来越多的人们识破了美帝国主义的纸老虎本质，“这是一件了不起的事情”。她说，当斗争中的人民把毛泽东思想“同他们的斗争结合起来的时候，就会从中汲取勇气和力量”。
    日本社会党国会议员帆足计说，“历史的规律是严峻的。三十年前，日本军国主义者曾经不可一世，但是它们最后还是像纸老虎那样垮台了。”
    帆足计指出，今天美帝国主义，也是纸老虎。是毫不可怕的。
    日本集邮协会理事长水原明窗说，自从我们懂得了帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎这个真理以后，在同美帝国主义作斗争时就变成了革命的乐观主义者了。
    他谴责有些人反对毛主席的这一英明论断，而伙同修正主义者搞什么“联合行动”。他指出，全世界的革命人民决不能同正在跟美帝国主义紧密合作的修正主义者搞“联合行动”。
    阿尔及利亚一位大学生说：“在我们民族解放战争的年代里，看来法国殖民者是强大的，但没过几年，便被我们打败了，赶跑了。这不是证明了毛泽东主席的论断的正确吗？”
    阿扎尼亚（南非）泛非主义者大会驻阿尔及尔代表莫科内最近对新华社记者说，正在为独立而斗争的阿扎尼亚人民钦佩毛泽东思想，并相信：根据毛主席的论断，他们最终是能够粉碎反动的维沃尔德法西斯政权及其以美帝国主义为首的同盟者的。
    索马里农业合作社组织主席易卜拉欣·阿达姆·法拉赫，在最近写的一篇文章说，毛主席教导我们，帝国主义是纸老虎，“我们将听从世界上前所未有的最伟大的领袖毛泽东主席的教导，狠狠地打击帝国主义者！我们将忠心耿耿地跟随毛泽东主席和忠于他的教导”。
    墨西哥著名社会活动家埃斯特尔·查帕女士说，毛主席的论断是一个无与伦比的思想武器，拉丁美洲各国人民一旦掌握了这个武器，他们就将无所畏惧，永远前进，同美帝国主义展开你死我活的斗争，以取得最后胜利。
    墨西哥著名经济学教授阿隆索·阿吉拉尔赞扬毛主席的论断说，中国人民革命的伟大胜利，当前亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲革命运动的高涨，打击了并正在打击着帝国主义、新老殖民主义和一切反动派，所有这一切都充分证明毛主席的这一论断是非常正确和非常英明的。
    两位墨西哥学生对新华社记者说，对于帝国主义，只要敢于斗争，就终将取得胜利，尽管斗争有时是艰巨的和曲折的，但是纸老虎毕竟是纸老虎。
