In a socialist society, socialist thought is predominant. However, selfish and individualistic thoughts still refuse to yield. Take the harmful old sayings, for example; some are still circulating. An old saying is just a few words, but it encapsulates many selfish and individualistic thoughts, becoming a kind of refined product of the feudal landlord and bourgeois ideology.

These old sayings that reflect outdated thoughts represent the interests of the exploiting classes. However, among the working people, there are those who can be deceived and corrupted by them. These old sayings spread widely, subtly influencing people, and their harm runs deep. Under the influence of these outdated thoughts, people may do things that are detrimental to the collective and to socialism. The Party branch of the Gufeng Production Brigade saw the serious harm they cause and took action to discard the old and establish the new. What they did was good and correct.

To establish the new, the old must be discarded! How to discard? The experience of the Gufeng Production Brigade Party branch is to use Mao Zedong Thought to do so. Mao Zedong Thought is the sharpest ideological weapon, an invincible treasure. To discard outdated thoughts, culture, customs, and habits, and to discard the ideology of the feudal landlords and bourgeoisie, one must use reason, must use Mao Zedong Thought, this truth of the proletarian revolution, and that is how to establish the new.

Various places have some harmful old sayings circulating. At an appropriate time, a few representative ones can be selected and put to the people for debate, using Mao Zedong Thought to refute them. Through debate, it will be known that what seems reasonable at first glance actually has no reason at all, but is full of fallacies. Through self-education by the masses, it will certainly touch the depths of people's souls, purge outdated thoughts, culture, customs, and habits, and establish new thoughts, culture, customs, and habits.

    俗话也要破旧立新
    在社会主义社会里，社会主义思想占了上风。可是，自私自利的个人主义思想，还不甘拜下风。就拿有毒的老俗话来说吧，现在有些还在流传。一句老俗话，不过几个字。然而，它却概括了许多自私自利的个人主义思想，成为地主资产阶级意识形态的某种精制品。
    这些反映旧思想的老俗话，代表了剥削阶级的利益。然而，在劳动人民当中，也会有人受到它的欺骗，受到它的腐蚀。这些老俗话，传播很广，潜移默化，流毒很深。有人在这种旧思想的支配下，就会做出不利于集体、不利于社会主义的事情来。古凤大队党支部看到它的毒害非同小可，就从这里着手，破旧立新。他们做得好，做得对。
    不破不立，要立新的，非破旧的不可！怎么破？古凤大队党支部的经验是，用毛泽东思想来破。毛泽东思想是最锐利的思想武器，是战无不胜的法宝。破旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，破地主资产阶级意识形态，就要讲道理，就要讲毛泽东思想这一无产阶级革命的真理，这就是立。
    各地都流传一些有毒的老俗话。可以在适当的时机，选出有代表性的几条来，放到群众中去辩论一番，用毛泽东思想来破它。辩论起来，就会知道，它乍听有理，其实没有一点正理，都是歪理。通过群众性的自我教育，一定会触及人的灵魂深处，涤荡旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，树立新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯。
