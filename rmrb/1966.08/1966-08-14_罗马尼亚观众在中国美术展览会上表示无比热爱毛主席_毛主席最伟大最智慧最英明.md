Romanian audience members at the Chinese art exhibition in Bucharest have expressed their deep admiration for Chairman Mao, hailing him as the greatest, wisest, and most brilliant leader.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, August 11—At the recent Chinese art exhibition held in Bucharest, Romanian audience members showed great interest in artworks that depicted the lofty image of Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people, expressing their deep love and reverence for him.

An elderly woman, standing in front of the oil painting "On the Eve of the Decisive Battle," exclaimed, "Long live Chairman Mao!" She added, "People all over the world are shouting, 'Long live Chairman Mao!'"

An elderly professor said, "I believe that Mao Zedong is the greatest thinker of our time, following Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin."

A worker said, "Chairman Mao Zedong is a great man. I deeply love Chairman Mao. You have Mao Zedong, and that is your happiness. Chairman Mao is not only the leader of the Chinese people but also the leader of all revolutionary people around the world."

A retired worker in his seventies said, "Chairman Mao is truly great. He always thinks of the people of the world, of the broad masses of workers and peasants. Only serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers is the true goal of a socialist state and a genuine communist party."

Many audience members highly praised the fact that the Chinese people are studying the works of Chairman Mao. In front of the oil painting "The Source of Strength," when the guide explained that the painting compares Chairman Mao's works to the source of strength, a technician repeatedly said, "Well done, well done. Seeing your achievements and explanations, it is clear that these achievements are due to the fact that you have the great Mao Zedong."

A railway worker said, "Chairman Mao Zedong is the greatest, wisest, and most brilliant person. I have read the first three volumes of 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' published in Romanian and some other works by Chairman Mao."

A professor said, "We should learn from Mao Zedong. I often study Mao Zedong's works."

A crane operator said, "Comrade Mao Zedong's judgment that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers is very correct. I agree with this view. American imperialism is not to be feared. If you are afraid of it, it will bully you; if you firmly resist it, it will fear you."

Many audience members expressed great concern for Chairman Mao's health. Upon hearing the news that Chairman Mao had recently swum across the Yangtze River, they were all very happy. A female teacher said, "Excellent! We are as happy and proud of Chairman Mao's health as you are."

Romanian audience members highly praised the Chinese art workers for holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and adhering to the principle of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving proletarian politics. A retired old general who had participated in the anti-fascist war, leaning on his cane with his wife, carefully toured the exhibition. He said, "Your exhibition items are revolutionary struggle and real-life reflections of art, with nothing abstract. People can understand them at a glance. The paintings fully express the joy, diligence, and optimism of the Chinese people."

Soldiers particularly liked "Sea Battle" and "Ouyang Hai Sacrifices Himself to Save the Train." A soldier said, "The painter truly reflects the life of workers, peasants, and soldiers."

An electrician, after seeing the exhibition's works related to supporting the anti-American struggles of the people of Vietnam, Congo, and the Dominican Republic, said, "China truly supports world revolution. Through these paintings, I have a better understanding of this."

The clay sculptures and photographs from "The Opium Den" on display at the exhibition aroused great interest and high praise from the audience. An old worker said, "This is the best material for class education. It is very important for the younger generation."

An art worker said, "The works of 'The Opium Den' are excellent. Not only are the characters vivid and full of amazing artistic appeal, but they also have profound political significance. This work should be preserved forever to educate the people."

A military academy student, after viewing the exhibition, said with tears in his eyes, "They should be placed in a museum to be preserved forever, so that future generations can see them. This is revolutionary art, truly reflecting the life of the people."

　　罗马尼亚观众在中国美术展览会上表示无比热爱毛主席
　　毛主席最伟大最智慧最英明
    据新华社布加勒斯特十一日电　在最近在布加勒斯特举行的中国美术作品展览会上，罗马尼亚观众十分关注那些反映中国人民伟大领袖毛主席的崇高形象的美术作品，表达了他们对毛主席的无比热爱和敬仰。
    一位老大娘在《决战前夕》的油画前激动地高呼“毛主席万岁！”并说，全世界人民都欢呼毛主席万岁！一位老教授说，“我认为，毛泽东是继马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林之后，当代最伟大的思想家。”一位工人说，“毛泽东主席是一位伟大人物。我非常热爱毛主席。你们有了毛泽东，这是你们的幸福。毛主席不仅是中国人民的领袖，而且也是全世界革命人民的领袖。”一位七十多岁的退休老工人说，“毛主席真伟大，他时时刻刻地想到全世界人民，想到广大的工人、农民。只有为工农兵服务才是真正的社会主义国家、真正的共产党的目标。”
    好些观众对广大的中国人民都在学习毛主席的著作评价很高。在油画《力量的源泉》的前面，当讲解员向观众说明，这幅画就是把毛主席的著作比作力量的源泉时，一位技师连声说，“比得好，比得好。看到你们所取得的成就和所作的解释，就清楚地说明了这些成就的取得，是由于你们有了伟大的毛泽东主席。”一位铁路工人说，“毛泽东主席是最伟大、最智慧和最英明的人。我已经读过了用罗马尼亚文出版的《毛泽东选集》头三卷和毛主席的一些其他著作”。一位教授说，“应该向毛泽东学习。我就经常学习毛泽东的著作。”一位起重机工人说，“毛泽东同志关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的论断非常正确，我同意这个观点。美帝国主义并不可怕。你要是怕它，它就欺负你；你要是坚决地同它斗，它就怕你。”
    许多观众对毛主席的健康十分关心，他们在听到毛主席不久前畅游长江的消息后都感到非常高兴。一位女教师说，“好极了！我们和你们一样为毛主席的健康感到高兴和幸福。”
    罗马尼亚观众对中国美术工作者高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，执行为工农兵服务、为无产阶级政治服务的方针给予热烈的称赞。一位曾参加过反法西斯战争的退伍老将军拄着手杖和他的夫人一起很仔细地参观了展览会，他说，“你们展览会的展品是反映革命斗争、反映现实生活的艺术，没有抽象的东西，人们一看就懂。画面上充分地表现了中国人民的喜悦、勤劳和乐观主义精神”。战士们则特别喜欢《海上战斗》、《欧阳海舍身救列车》等画。一位战士说，“画家真正反映了工农兵的生活。”一位电机工人看了画展中有关支援越南、刚果和多米尼加人民反美斗争的作品时说，“中国是真正支持世界革命的。通过这些画，使我更加了解这一点。”
    展览会展出的泥塑《收租院》部分作品和照片引起了观众的极大兴趣和高度评价。一位老工人说，“这是一部进行阶级教育最好的教材。它对青年一代十分重要。”一位美术工作者说，“《收租院》作品太好了，不仅人物个个栩栩如生，具有惊人的艺术感染力，而且有着深刻的政治意义，这部作品应当永世长存用来教育人民。”一位军官学校学生看完后含着泪水说，“应当把它们放在博物馆里永远保存下来，让后代好好看看。这才是革命的艺术，真正反映人民生活的艺术。”
