We Must Serve the Revolution in Finance and Trade

Vice Political Instructor of the First Branch of the Xi'an City Department Store, Cao Xiulan

Sun Yefang is madly opposing Mao Zedong Thought, opposing us workers, peasants, and soldiers in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. This is a grand conspiracy against the Party and against socialism.

Whether or not to study Chairman Mao's works is a major issue of whether to adhere to the socialist direction. On this point, we have deep experiences and lessons. In 1963, because we did not emphasize the study of Chairman Mao's works and did not adhere to Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, we neglected the Party's policy of developing production and ensuring supply, the task of serving production and people's livelihood, and the teaching that finance and trade must have political, production, and mass perspectives. Therefore, the work of the branch was not done well, and the thoughts of the staff were in chaos. Some comrades did not truly start from the interests of the masses, were afraid of trouble, were afraid of hard work, liked to do big deals but not small deals, only organized the sale of fast-moving and popular goods, and neglected the small goods needed by the masses.

Chairman Mao said: "Politics is the commander, politics is the soul." "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." We, based on Chairman Mao's teachings, took class struggle as the key link, and with the study and application of Chairman Mao's works as the driving force, we firmly grasped the ideological transformation of the people. We organized everyone to repeatedly study "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," "Moving the Mountains," "On Practice," and "On Contradiction." Through the study of Chairman Mao's works, everyone's minds became clear. Everyone said: Our past work was not done well because we did not seriously listen to Chairman Mao's words. In the future, we must be like Zhang Side and Norman Bethune, be a noble person, and completely and thoroughly serve the people. Thus, the spiritual face of the comrades quickly underwent a fundamental change. The communist style of selflessness and dedication was greatly promoted; completely and thoroughly serving the people became the standard for most comrades to measure their own work; not seeking fame or profit, not fearing hardship or death, wholeheartedly for the people, wholeheartedly for the revolution, serving the revolution in finance and trade, and standing at the counter for the revolution became the common aspiration of most comrades. Many new people and new things emerged.

We also, based on the opinions of the comrades and the Party's instructions on finance and trade work, with the spirit of completely and thoroughly serving the people, studied and improved from the aspects of rules and regulations, service attitude, and service quality. We have taken a series of measures to facilitate customers. The branch increased from originally operating over 4,000 items to over 6,000 items, and the retail starting point was lowered again and again. We also organized all the staff to conduct investigations and visits to nearby communes, residents' committees, and units, not only increasing over 300 kinds of small commodities based on the opinions of the masses, but also adopting the method of regular door-to-door delivery to nearby hospitals, hotels, and other units.

We are the people's commerce, and we should treat the people like our own family. Once, a blind customer asked me to pick a sturdy coat and a pair of shoes for his child. I immediately warmly received him. The child did not like the color of the buttons, and I took them off and changed them to other buttons. The customer was so moved that he shed tears and kept saying, "You are so good, this is all because Chairman Mao leads us well!" Because we have established the thought of completely and thoroughly serving the people, we have been praised by the masses many times in our business and have also met the requirements of the Party and the higher authorities in other aspects of work.

In recent years, I have deeply realized in revolutionary practice that Mao Zedong Thought is the source of all our strength. With Mao Zedong Thought, people become the most selfless, the bravest, and the smartest, and can do any work well and overcome any difficulty. With Mao Zedong Thought, one can change the face of people and change the face of enterprises. Sun Yefang opposes Mao Zedong Thought, opposes us workers, peasants, and soldiers in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, opposes political leadership, and advocates material incentives, which is to make our enterprises deviate from the socialist path, to corrupt the thoughts of finance and trade workers, and to open the door wide for the restoration of capitalism. This is a futile attempt! The revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought will surely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and thoroughly smash Sun Yefang's fallacies!

    我们要为革命办财贸
    西安市百货公司第一门市部副政治指导员　曹秀兰
    孙冶方疯狂地反对毛泽东思想，反对我们工农兵群众活学活用毛主席著作。这是一个反党、反社会主义的大阴谋。
    学习不学习毛主席著作，是一个坚持不坚持社会主义方向的大问题。这一方面，我们有着深刻的体会和教训。在一九六三年，由于没有狠抓毛主席著作学习，没有坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，我们忽视了党提出的发展生产、保障供给的方针，为生产、为人民生活服务的任务，以及办财贸一定要有政治观点、生产观点、群众观点的教导。因此，门市部工作没有搞好，职工思想混乱。有些同志没有真正地从群众利益出发，怕麻烦，怕吃苦，光爱做大买卖，不爱做小买卖，只顾组织快销畅销的商品，忽视了群众需要的小商品。
    毛主席说：政治是统帅，政治是灵魂。“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”我们根据毛主席的教导，以阶级斗争为纲，以活学活用毛主席著作为动力，狠抓了人的思想革命化，组织大家反复学习了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》、《实践论》和《矛盾论》等文章。通过学习毛主席著作，同志们心明眼亮了。大家说：我们过去工作没做好，就是没有认真地听毛主席的话。今后，我们一定要象张思德、白求恩那样，做一个高尚的人，完全、彻底为人民服务。于是，同志们的精神面貌很快地起了根本的变化。毫不利己专门利人的共产主义风格，大大地发扬起来；完全、彻底为人民服务，成了大多数同志衡量自己工作的标尺；不为名、不为利，不怕苦、不怕死，一心为人民、一心为革命，为革命办财贸、为革命站柜台，成了多数同志的共同心愿。新人新事大量地涌现出来。
    我们又根据同志们的意见和党对财贸工作的指示，以完全、彻底为人民服务的精神，从规章制度、服务态度、服务质量等方面进行了研究和改进。我们先后采取了一系列便利顾客的措施。门市部由原经营四千多种商品增加到六千多种，零售起点一降再降。我们还组织全体职工对附近的公社、居民委员会和机关单位进行了调查访问，不仅根据群众的意见，增加了三百多种小商品，而且对附近医院、旅馆等单位采取了定期送货上门的办法。
    我们是人民的商业，对人民就要象对亲人一样。有一次，一位双目失明的顾客要我给他的孩子挑一件结实的上衣和一双鞋，我当即热情地接待了。孩子嫌扣子的颜色不好，我还给拆下另换上别的扣子。这位顾客感动得掉下泪来，连声地说：“你们太好了，这都是毛主席领导得好！”由于我们树立了完全、彻底为人民服务的思想，我们在营业中一再得到了群众的表扬，在其他工作方面也达到了党和上级的要求。
    几年来，我在革命的实践中深刻地认识到：毛泽东思想是我们一切力量的源泉。有了毛泽东思想，人就变得最无私、最勇敢、最聪明，什么工作都能做好，什么困难都能克服。有了毛泽东思想，就能改变人的面貌，改变企业的面貌。孙冶方反对毛泽东思想，反对我们工农兵群众活学活用毛主席著作，反对政治挂帅，提倡物质刺激，就是要使我们的企业离开社会主义的道路，要腐蚀财贸工作人员的思想，为资本主义复辟大开方便之门。这是痴心妄想！用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民，一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底地粉碎孙冶方的谬论！
