		New China News Agency, Shanghai, August 2
		The full text of the speech by D. S. Senanayake, Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Writers' Bureau, at the mass meeting in Shanghai to see off the Afro-Asian writers is as follows:

		Chairman Guo Moruo of the Emergency Conference of Afro-Asian Writers, Chairman Liao Chengzhi of the Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, Deputy Mayors Liang Guobin, Zhang Chengzong, and Jin Zhonghua of Shanghai, dear colleagues, and friends:

		As the Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Writers' Bureau, I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to the people of Shanghai, the deputy mayors, the director of the Cultural Bureau, the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Writers' Association, and all the people who warmly welcomed us when we arrived in this historic city two days ago.

		Shanghai is a city renowned for its revolutionary traditions. The heroic people of Shanghai have a glorious record of struggle against various imperialist invaders who have plundered them in the past. They are true friends of the peace-loving people of the world and staunch fighters against imperialism and old and new colonialism. Therefore, allow me to pay tribute to the heroic and fighting people of Shanghai. Now, tens of thousands of Shanghai people have gathered here to bid farewell to the writer colleagues who have come for a friendly visit and to express their solidarity and friendship.

		After the successful conclusion of the Emergency Conference of Afro-Asian Writers in Beijing in support of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression, we writers have been visiting and touring China for more than two weeks. During our visit, our Afro-Asian friends have come into contact with people from all walks of life in China; wherever they went, they were treated with great hospitality and friendship, which deeply moved them. What moved them even more was that they saw that the 700 million Chinese people are wholeheartedly building a new and happy society in the economic, cultural, and political spheres.

		When our friends leave China to return home, their deepest impression is that tens of millions of Chinese people, young and old, are using Chairman Mao's thoughts in the process of transforming themselves in the cultural, social, economic, and political spheres to achieve a better and happier life in a truly socialist society. In this regard, let us pay tribute to the glorious People's Liberation Army of China, which is always on high alert, defending the lofty ideals and interests of the entire people of this great country. Workers, peasants, artists, scientists, and cultural workers are applying Chairman Mao's thoughts in their daily work and achieving outstanding results. This has become a proven path to victory in various activities. This is not only the case in China. Chairman Mao Zedong's path is the path to victory for all the oppressed and exploited peoples of the world who are bravely fighting against imperialism and old and new colonialism. The Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression fully proves the correctness of Chairman Mao's thoughts. The Vietnamese people can only achieve freedom and national liberation through their armed struggle today and achieve one victory after another. This is why we Afro-Asian writers gathered in Beijing to express our sincere support to the heroic Vietnamese people.

		Representatives from 53 countries and regions participated in this historic meeting in Beijing. The most notable thing is the absence of Soviet writers. Soviet writers have chosen the path of revisionism. They did not have the courage to come with us to support the struggle of the Vietnamese people. Because of their actions, we are forced to conclude that they do not intend to support the Vietnamese people. Who do they support?

		In this situation, if anyone concludes that they are cooperating with U.S. imperialism, is that wrong? Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko and Japanese Prime Minister Sato issued a joint statement in Tokyo two days ago. In this statement, not a word was mentioned about the crimes committed by U.S. imperialism in Vietnam. Are they not deceiving themselves? Are they not betraying the Soviet people? Are they not betraying the liberation struggle of the oppressed peoples of the world?

		This is why we say that fighters against imperialism and old and new colonialism must also wage a resolute struggle against modern revisionism to achieve final victory. The Soviet modern revisionists do not stop there. Now they are further attempting to split the Afro-Asian writers' movement and sabotage the unity of Afro-Asian writers and peoples.

		We know that Soviet revisionists are not the first time to play this trick in revolutionary international organizations. Ultimately, they are serving the interests of imperialists and reactionaries. The Soviet Union is the great country of Lenin, who inspired the oppressed masses to revolt and established the world's first socialist country. Today, we see a heartbreaking scene: in that country, a degenerate leadership is constantly tarnishing the name of that great hero and liberator of mankind.

		However, it is comforting to know that Chairman Mao, this hero and liberator of mankind, is guiding the oppressed peoples along the great path pointed out by Lenin to victory. Therefore, the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America today have placed their hope in Beijing, not in Moscow.

		The U.S. imperialists are gradually escalating their criminal war in Vietnam. They are establishing war bases around the People's Republic of China. They have occupied China's Taiwan Province. We know that the Chinese people are a peace-loving people, but if the U.S. aggressors make the mistake of provoking a war against China, we believe that the 700 million Chinese people will rise up to fight back and thoroughly eliminate the U.S. aggressors from the entire region. We believe that the people of Shanghai, who have a glorious tradition of generations of struggle against U.S. imperialist invaders, will make their due contribution to this struggle and write a new page in gold for the history of Shanghai.

		Dear friends,

		Let me once again thank the heroic people of Shanghai for the extremely warm welcome and hospitality they have given us during our stay here.

		Long live Afro-Asian writers!
		Long live the friendship between the Chinese people and the peoples of Asia and Africa!
		Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!

### 毛主席的道路是世界人民胜利的道路  亚非拉被压迫人民把信心寄托在北京

    森纳那亚克秘书长在上海群众欢送大会上讲话
    毛主席的道路是世界人民胜利的道路

    苏修为美帝效劳，出卖世界被压迫人民的解放斗争，破坏亚非团结
    新华社上海二日电　亚非作家常设局秘书长德希普里耶·森纳那亚克在上海欢送亚非作家代表的群众大会上的讲话，全文如下：亚非作家紧急会议主席郭沫若
  先生，中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承
  志先生，上海市副市长梁国斌先生、张
  承宗先生、金仲华先生，亲爱的同事们，朋友们：
    我作为亚非作家常设局的秘书长，借此机会向上海市人民、副市长、文化局局长、中国作家协会上海分会，并向两天以前当我们到达这座有历史意义的城市的时候对我们表示热烈欢迎的所有的人，表示深切的感谢。
    上海是一个以其革命传统而著称的城市。英雄的上海人民在同过去不断对他们进行掠夺的各式各样的帝国主义侵略者的斗争中，有着光荣的记录。他们是全世界爱好和平人民的真正的朋友，是反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的坚强的战士。因此，请允许我向英雄的、战斗的上海人民致敬。现在成千上万的上海人民又聚集在这里向来到这里进行友好访问的作家同事们告别，并表示他们的团结与友谊。
    在北京举行的支援越南人民抗美斗争的亚非作家紧急会议胜利闭幕以后，我们作家代表们在中国参观访问了两个多星期。在访问期间，我们的亚非朋友们和中国各行各业的人进行了接触；他们所到之处，所受到的殷勤款待，和友好表示，使他们深受感动，使他们更加感动的是，他们看到七亿中国人民在经济方面、文化方面和政治方面正在全心全意地建设一个新的幸福的社会。
    当我们的朋友们离开中国回国的时候，他们最深刻的印象是，亿万中国人民，不分老幼，为了在一个真正社会主义的社会里实现更美好的更幸福的生活，而在文化、社会、经济、政治诸方面进行改造的过程中，是如何运用毛主席的思想的。在这一方面，让我们向光荣的中国人民解放军致敬，他们不断提高警惕，捍卫着这个伟大国家的全体人民的崇高的理想和利益。工人、农民、艺术家、科学家和文化工作者在日常工作中运用毛主席的思想，取得了优异的成果。这已成为人们在各种活动中取得胜利的经过考验的道路。这不仅在中国是如此。毛泽东主席的道路就是全世界所有为反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义而英勇斗争的被压迫和被剥削人民取得胜利的道路。越南人民反对美国侵略的斗争充分证明了毛主席思想的正确性。越南人民只有通过他们今天正在进行的武装斗争而且取得一个又一个的胜利才能够得到自由和民族解放。这就是为什么我们亚非作家要在北京聚会向英雄的越南人民表示真诚的支持。
  五十三个国家和地区的代表参加了北京的这一历史性的会议。最值得注意的是苏联作家的缺席。苏联作家选择了修正主义的道路。他们没有勇气同我们一起来支持越南人民的斗争。由于他们的这一行动，我们被迫不能不得出这样的结论，那就是他们不打算支持越南人民。他们支持谁呢？
    在这种情况下，如果任何一个人得出结论说，他们是在同美帝国主义合作，难道是错误的吗？苏联外交部长葛罗米柯同日本佐藤首相两天前在东京发表了一个联合公报。在这个公报中对美帝国主义在越南所犯下的罪行一字未提。难道他们不是在欺骗自己吗？难道他们不是在出卖苏联人民吗？难道他们不是在出卖全世界被压迫人民的解放斗争吗？
    这就是为什么我们说反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的战士为了取得最后的胜利，还要向现代修正主义进行坚决的斗争。苏联现代修正主义者还不止于此，现在他们已经进一步企图分裂亚非作家运动、破坏亚非作家和人民的团结。
    我们知道苏联修正主义者已不是第一次在革命的国际组织中玩弄这一花招，他们这样做归根结蒂是为帝国主义者和反动派的利益效劳的。苏联是伟大的列宁的国家，列宁曾经鼓舞了被蹂躏的群众起来革命，结果创立了世界上第一个社会主义国家。今天我们看到一种痛心的景象：在那个国家里，一个堕落了的领导不断在沾污着那个伟大的英雄和人类的解放者的名字。
    但是，可以告慰的是，毛主席这位英雄和人类的解放者在引导着被压迫人民沿着伟大的列宁所指出的道路走向胜利。因此，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的被压迫人民今天已经把信心寄托于北京，而不是寄托在莫斯科。
    美帝国主义者正在把他们在越南的罪恶战争逐步升级。他们在围绕着中华人民共和国建立战争基地。他们强占了中国的台湾省。我们知道中国人民是爱好和平的人民，但是如果美国侵略者要犯对中国挑起战争的错误，我们相信七亿中国人民将起而应战，并把美国侵略者从整个地区彻底消灭掉。我们相信，有着数代反对美帝国主义侵略者的光荣传统的上海人民，将对这一斗争作出他们应有的贡献，并且为上海的历史用金字写下新的一页。
    亲爱的朋友们，
    让我再一次感谢英雄的上海人民，感谢他们在我们停留在这里的期间所给予我们的非常热烈的欢迎和款待。
    亚非作家万岁！
    中国人民和亚非人民之间的友谊万岁！
    毛泽东主席万岁！
