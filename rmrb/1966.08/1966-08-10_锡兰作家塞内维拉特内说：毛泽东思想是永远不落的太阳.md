Sri Lankan writer Senewiratne says: “Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light for all oppressed nations and peoples in their struggle for liberation. The brilliant light of Mao Zedong’s works illuminates the revolutionary path for the peoples of the world. Mao Zedong Thought is the eternal sun.”

Senewiratne is a member of the Sri Lankan delegation that recently attended the emergency meeting of Asian and African writers held in Beijing. The Sri Lankan Literary Revival Society recently held a reception for him in Colombo upon his return. In his speech at the reception, he enthusiastically praised Mao Zedong Thought.

He said, “Modern Soviet revisionism has degenerated into an accomplice of American imperialism. It is terrified by the surging tide of armed revolutions of the peoples of the world—especially the armed revolutions of the Asian and African peoples.” He said: “To sabotage the revolutionary struggles of the Asian and African peoples, they (the modern Soviet revisionists) have used and are using literature and art to corrupt the revolutionary will of the Asian and African peoples.” He said: “The modern Soviet revisionist writers are members of the privileged class of the Soviet bourgeoisie today, serving as the mouthpiece of this privileged class. They strenuously oppose the revolutions of the peoples of various countries to maintain the vested interests of this class.”

He said that progressive writers in Asia and Africa must oppose Soviet modern revisionism. He stressed: “We must write revolutionary literature to inspire and support the just struggles of the peoples of various countries.”

    锡兰作家塞内维拉特内说：
    毛泽东思想是永远不落的太阳
    据新华社科伦坡电　锡兰作家塞内维拉特内说：“毛泽东思想是当代一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民用来谋求解放自己的思想。毛泽东著作的灿烂光辉照亮了世界各国人民的革命道路。毛泽东思想是永远不落的太阳。”
    塞内维拉特内是最近参加在北京举行的亚非作家紧急会议的锡兰代表团成员。锡兰僧伽罗文学复兴会最近在科伦坡为他归国举行了一个招待会，他在会上讲话时热烈赞扬毛泽东思想。
    他说，苏联现代修正主义已经堕落成为美帝国主义的帮凶，它被风起云涌的世界人民武装革命的浪潮——特别是亚非人民武装革命的浪潮——吓的要死。他说：“为了破坏亚非人民的革命斗争，他们（苏联现代修正主义者）使用了、并且正在使用着文学艺术来腐蚀亚非人民的革命意志。”他说：“苏联现代修正主义作家是今天的苏联资产阶级特权阶层的成员，充当这个特权阶层的喉舌。他们竭力反对各国人民革命，以维护这个阶层的既得利益。”
    他说，亚非进步作家必须反对苏联现代修正主义。他强调说：“我们必须写出革命文学来鼓舞和支持各国的正义斗争。”
