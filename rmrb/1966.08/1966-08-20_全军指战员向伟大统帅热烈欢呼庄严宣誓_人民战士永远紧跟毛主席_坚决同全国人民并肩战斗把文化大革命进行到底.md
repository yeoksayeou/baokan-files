All PLA personnel warmly cheer the great commander and solemnly pledge
People's soldiers will forever follow Chairman Mao
Firmly fight alongside the people of the entire nation to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 19th, the news that the great leader Chairman Mao, dressed in military uniform, stood on Tiananmen Rostrum to meet revolutionary masses, stirred the hearts of the broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army. Sailors sang along with the waves; border guards sang joyously facing the rising sun; air force soldiers who had just returned from the blue sky in their warplanes, as soon as they stepped out of the cockpit, were overjoyed. From the hearts of the broad masses of soldiers and officers, one voice emerged:

"We, though far from Beijing across mountains and rivers, have our hearts close to Chairman Mao; we listen to Beijing's broadcasts and feel that Chairman Mao is by our side. Chairman Mao and we have hearts connected!"

The great commander Chairman Mao, dressed in military uniform, stood on Tiananmen Rostrum, issuing a new battle command: carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end! We solemnly pledge: People's soldiers will forever follow Chairman Mao, revolution, revolution, eternal revolution!"

The news of Chairman Mao celebrating the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution with millions of people, like thunder in spring, turned a certain naval wharf into a sea of joy. Sailors excitedly said: This is Chairman Mao meeting with 700 million people! Although we are not in Beijing, not at Tiananmen, our hearts have long flown to Beijing, flown to Tiananmen! Chairman Mao gets up so early, is so healthy, this is the greatest happiness for the people of the entire nation! The broadcast transmitted Comrade Lin Biao's speech at the meeting, saying that Chairman Mao is the supreme commander of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times. Five Good Soldier Wang Chunyan took out the red and shining "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and waved it in the air, shouting: This is our atomic bomb to defeat all enemies! This is our most powerful weapon to smash the old world.

Soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force, guarding the southeastern front of the motherland, excitedly listened to the live broadcast of the celebration meeting at the airport, anti-aircraft artillery positions, and radar positions. When everyone heard that our most great and beloved leader Chairman Mao came to Tiananmen, they all shouted loudly: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" The cheers of the air force soldiers blended with the cheers of millions of people from the radio, forming a harmonious chorus. Pilots wearing anti-G suits, ready to intercept enemies at any moment, all had smiles of happiness on their faces. They said: Although we are far away on the southeastern coast of the motherland, Chairman Mao is with us, giving us great encouragement and strength, making us feel full of energy! We are heart to heart with the millions of revolutionary masses in the capital, and with the billions of revolutionary masses throughout the nation! We will join hands and shoulders with them to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

From yesterday morning, the broad masses of soldiers and officers of various units of the People's Liberation Army, personally created by Chairman Mao, have not had a moment of calm in their excited hearts. They gathered under loudspeakers and by radios, listening to the voices from Tiananmen Square, and their hearts surged with the surging Tiananmen Square. Today, soldiers and officers saw in the newspapers the photos and reports of Chairman Mao meeting with millions of revolutionary masses, and they cheered and jumped with joy. Pledge books and determination letters, like snowflakes, were sent to the party organizations of the units. Long-distance telephone calls and telegrams, one after another, came from high mountain outposts and islands on the coastal front line to the unit leadership organs, to the capital Beijing, expressing determination to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Urumqi City, wearing new military uniforms, carrying a giant portrait of Chairman Mao, holding banners reading "We will forever follow the great leader, supreme commander Chairman Mao and advance to victory!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" and others, drumming and gonging, surged from all directions to the square, gathering with people of all ethnic groups to celebrate the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The leadership organs of the Kunming units, after listening to the broadcast, carried the giant portrait of Chairman Mao and quotation boards, drumming and gonging, surged onto the streets, coming to the Cultural Palace, and sang and danced with revolutionary students and teachers. The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the units stationed in Beijing were even more excited. Those who participated in the Tiananmen Square rally of millions of people and saw Chairman Mao, as soon as they returned to the unit, immediately told the comrades the good news. Many soldiers and officers also carried the giant portrait of Chairman Mao, drumming and gonging, rushed to the reception station of the CPC Central Committee to deliver determination letters. The entire army was immersed in a sea of joy and excitement.

　　全军指战员向伟大统帅热烈欢呼庄严宣誓
　　人民战士永远紧跟毛主席
　　坚决同全国人民并肩战斗把文化大革命进行到底
    据新华社十九日讯　伟大领袖毛主席身穿军装，站在天安门城楼上会见革命群众的喜讯，激荡着人民解放军广大指战员的心。水兵们和着海涛，放声欢呼；边防战士们迎着朝阳，纵情歌唱；驾着战鹰刚从蔚蓝天空返航的空军战士们，一走下机舱，就欣喜若狂。从广大指战员的心底里迸发出同一个声音：
    “我们和北京虽然远隔千山万水，但是，我们的心紧紧贴着毛主席；我们听着北京的广播，感到毛主席就在我们身边。毛主席和我们心连着心！
    伟大统帅毛主席身穿军装，站在天安门城楼上，发出了新的战斗命令：把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！我们庄严地宣誓：人民战士永远紧跟毛主席，革命，革命，永革命！”
    毛主席和百万群众一起庆祝无产阶级文化大革命的喜讯，像声声春雷，把海军某码头变成了欢腾的海洋，水兵们兴奋地说：这是毛主席与七亿人民会见！我们人虽不在北京，不在天安门，但是，我们的心早就飞向了北京，飞向天安门！毛主席起得这样早，身体这样健康，这是全国人民最大的幸福！广播里传出林彪同志在大会讲话说，毛主席是我们无产阶级文化大革命的最高统帅。毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义。五好战士王春彦拿出红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》在空中挥动，高声地说：这就是我们战胜一切敌人的原子弹！这就是我们砸碎旧世界的最有力武器。
    守卫在祖国东南前线的中国人民解放军空军某部指战员，在机场、高炮阵地、雷达阵地上，激动地收听了庆祝大会的实况广播。当大家听到我们最伟大最敬爱的领袖毛主席来到天安门时，都放声高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”空军战士的欢呼声同收音机中传出的百万群众的欢呼声交织成一片。穿着抗荷服随时准备凌空歼敌的飞行员们，个个脸上露出幸福的微笑，他们说：我们虽然远在祖国的东南海滨，但是，毛主席和我们在一起，给了我们巨大的鼓舞和力量，只觉得浑身是劲！我们和首都百万革命群众心连心，和全国亿万革命群众心连心！我们要同他们手携手肩并肩地把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    从昨天清晨开始，毛主席亲手缔造的人民解放军各部队广大指战员，激动的心情一刻也没有平静过。他们集合在广播喇叭下，收音机旁，收听来自天安门广场的声音时，心情就随着沸腾的天安门广场一起沸腾。今天，指战员们看到了报上登载的毛主席和百万革命群众会见的照片和报道，更是欢呼跳跃。一张张保证书、决心书，雪片般地送到部队党组织。长途电话、电报，一个接着一个，从高山哨所，从海防前线小岛通向部队领导机关，通向首都北京，向党中央、毛主席表示决心。驻乌鲁木齐市人民解放军某部指战员，穿着一色新军装，抬着毛主席的巨幅画像，举着“我们永远跟着伟大领袖、最高统帅毛主席胜利前进！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想胜利万岁！”等横幅，敲锣打鼓地从四面八方涌向广场，和各族人民一起集会，欢庆无产阶级文化大革命。昆明部队领导机关的干部、战士听完广播，就抬着毛主席的巨幅画像和语录牌，敲锣打鼓地涌上街头，来到文化宫，同革命师生载歌载舞进行联欢。驻北京部队的广大指战员们，心情更是激动。当天参加了天安门百万群众大会，见到毛主席的指战员们，一回部队，立刻把这个喜讯告诉同志们。许多指战员们还抬着毛主席巨幅画像，敲锣打鼓，赶到中共中央所在地的接待站送决心书。全军上下，沉浸在一片喜悦和欢腾之中。
