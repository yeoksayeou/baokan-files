In the face of any difficulty, we can stand firm and hold steady!

Most respected Party Central Committee, most respected Chairman Mao:

When we heard the news on the radio that the most respected Chairman Mao had received revolutionary masses, our hearts were filled with excitement and could not calm down.

Most respected Chairman Mao! Although we have not seen you, our hearts have already flown to your side. You took time out of your busy schedule to receive revolutionary masses, showing such concern for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and such concern for the revolutionary masses. This has filled us with even more revolutionary confidence. You are our guiding light in the storms of class struggle, you are our revolutionary teacher. You are the greatest, you are the wisest. We resolutely follow you to the end, daring to climb mountains of knives and cross seas of fire. No matter what setbacks or obstacles we encounter, we can hold steady and stand firm. We have the confidence and determination to expose all the ghosts and snakes, both on stage and off stage, in front of the curtain and behind the curtain.

With hearts full of revolutionary passion, we shout:

Long live the Communist Party!
Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!

All revolutionary comrades from Beijing First Kindergarten, Shizi Hill Kindergarten, Beixiaojie Kindergarten, Xinzhong Street Kindergarten, and Teaching Staff Second Kindergarten

　　在任何困难面前我们都能站得稳顶得住最敬爱的党中央最敬爱的毛主席：
    当我们从广播中听到最敬爱的毛主席接见革命群众的消息后，我们兴奋的心情一直不能平静。
    最敬爱的毛主席！我们虽然没有看见您，但我们的心早已飞到您的身边。您在百忙中抽出时间来接待革命群众，您对无产阶级文化大革命如此关心，对革命群众如此关心，这更使我们充满了革命信心。您是我们阶级斗争风浪中的指路明灯，您是我们革命的导师。您最伟大，您最英明。我们坚决跟您走到底，刀山敢上，火海敢闯，不管遇到多大挫折、阻力，我们都能顶得住，站得稳。我们有信心，有决心把一切台上台下幕前幕后的牛鬼蛇神统统揪出来。
    我们满怀革命激情高呼：
    共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！万万岁！
