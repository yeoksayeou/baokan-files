The emancipated peasants of Cezhuo Lin Township in the suburbs of Lhasa have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly breaking with feudalistic old customs and habits, and recently celebrated a "Fruit Viewing Festival" filled with revolutionary spirit.

On August 4th, the emancipated peasants gathered in the shade of the verdant trees of the Lin Ka. They first selected the mutual aid team that excelled in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Then they held a labor competition, and arranged for activities such as making agricultural tools, repairing the fields, and preparing for the autumn harvest.

During the festival, the peasants watched over thirty amateur song and dance performances put on by the local troupe. These performances praised the Party and Chairman Mao, sang the praises of the People's Liberation Army, and celebrated the new people and new deeds in production and construction who study and apply Chairman Mao's works.

    拉萨翻身农民大破旧习俗
   “望果节”充满革命新内容
    拉萨郊区策觉林乡的翻身农民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大破封建主义的旧风俗、旧习惯，在前几天度过了一个充满革命气氛的“望果节”。
    八月四日这天，翻身农民纷纷来到绿树成荫的林卡里，首先评选了活学活用毛主席著作突出的互助组，接着进行了劳动评比，还安排了打制农具、修补场地和秋收准备等项农活。
    翻身农民在节日里，观看了业余歌舞队自编自演的三十多个文艺节目。这些节目都是歌颂党和毛主席，歌颂解放军和在生产建设中活学活用毛主席著作的新人新事的。
