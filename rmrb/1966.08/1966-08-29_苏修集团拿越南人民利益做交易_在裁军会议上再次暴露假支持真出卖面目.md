The Soviet revisionist group trades the interests of the Vietnamese people. At the disarmament conference, they once again expose their hypocritical stance of fake support and real betrayal.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 27th: Geneva news: While the United States is accelerating the increase of troops in South Vietnam and continuously expanding the bombing of North Vietnam, the Soviet representative in the Geneva disarmament conference of 17 nations is getting along well with the U.S. representative. Furthermore, they reiterated the position of the Soviet authorities: Despite the Vietnam War, "we cannot abandon the work of making progress in this (disarmament) field, nor can we relax our efforts in this regard." This once again exposes the treacherous face of the Soviet revisionist leadership group in the Vietnam issue, where they pretend to support but actually betray.

The Geneva disarmament conference, which began in January this year, ended on August 25. As usual, the conference will submit a work report to the next session of the United Nations General Assembly and submit the disarmament issue for discussion. Soviet representative Rozen said in his speech on the 25th that he thought this conference "was not without benefit"; after hypocritically condemning the U.S. aggression against Vietnam a few times, he immediately emphasized that the "efforts" for disarmament cannot be relaxed. He also assured the U.S. representative that the Soviet side would continue to seek "methods acceptable to both sides" to "stop" the arms race, especially the nuclear arms race.

According to a Reuters report, Western countries' representatives were satisfied with Rozen's attitude. They pointed out that Rozen "seemed eager to resume negotiations as soon as possible after the UNGA meeting." This "encouraged these representatives, giving them hope that the conference expected to be held in January next year might be more fruitful."

U.S. representative Fisher revealed in his speech that the transaction between the U.S. and the Soviet Union on the issue of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons "is close to success" during this year's conference. He emphasized: "In this conference, we have made more actual progress than at any time since 1963 (when the three-nation partial nuclear test ban treaty was signed), and I believe we are very close to success."

British representative Chalfant also said in his speech: It seems that the U.S. and the Soviet Union are very likely to reach an agreement on the issue of banning underground nuclear tests.

    苏修集团拿越南人民利益做交易
    在裁军会议上再次暴露假支持真出卖面目
    据新华社二十七日讯  日内瓦消息：在美国加紧增兵南越、不断扩大轰炸越南北方的同时，苏联代表在日内瓦十七国裁军会议上同美国代表打得火热，并且重申了苏联当局的这一立场：尽管有越南战争，“也不能放弃在这个
  （裁军）领域里取得进展的工作，不能放松在这方面的努力”。这就再一次暴露了苏联修正主义领导集团在越南问题上的假支持、真出卖的叛徒嘴脸。
    今年一月开始的这次日内瓦裁军会议已于八月二十五日结束。照例，会议将向下届联合国大会提出工作报告，并把裁军问题提交大会讨论。苏联代表罗申在二十五日的会议上发言说，他认为这次会议“不是没有益处的”；他在假惺惺的谴责了几句美国侵略越南之后，紧接着又强调表示，裁军“努力”不能放松。他并且向美国代表保证，苏联方面将继续寻求“可以为双方所接受”的方法来“制止”军备竞赛，特别是核军备方面的竞赛。
    据路透社报道，西方国家代表对罗申的这种态度表示满意，他们指出，罗申“显得急于在联大开会之后，尽快地恢复谈判”。这“鼓舞了这些代表，使他们抱有这种希望：预期在明年一月举行的（裁军）会议上可能更富于成果”。
    美国代表费希尔在发言中透露，在今年的会议上，美苏双方在禁止扩散核武器问题上的交易“正接近于成功”。他强调说：在这次会议上，“我们已经取得了比一九六三年（签订三国部分禁止核试验条约）以来任何时候都要多的实际进展，而且我相信，我们正非常接近于成功。”
    英国代表查尔方特也在发言中说：看来苏美双方很有可能就禁止地下核试验问题达成协议。
