Fujian's broad masses of fishermen have broken the old habit of "resting the sea" during the summer fishing season, achieving a bumper harvest in this summer's fishing production. Since June, they have caught 1.1 million dan of fish, more than double the amount caught in the same period last year.

Summer fishing production mainly involves catching small mixed fish in coastal and inland waters, with relatively low yields per unit. Some larger fishing production units would traditionally "rest the sea" after the spring fishing season to repair their boats and nets, only to return to the sea during the autumn and winter fishing seasons. This year, driven by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of fishermen proposed to eliminate the old habit of "resting the sea," establish new customs, and catch more fish to supply the urban and rural populations. They tapped the potential of their boats, nets, and tools, investing in summer fishing production; at the same time, they repaired their boats and nets to prepare for the autumn and winter fishing seasons. The number of fishing boats concentrated in the main fishing grounds during the summer fishing season—the Minnan fishing grounds—has increased by more than half compared to last year.

    福建夏季鱼汛大丰收
    福建省广大渔民破除夏汛“歇海”的旧习惯，今年夏季鱼汛生产获得大丰收。从六月份以来，已捕鱼一百一十万担，比去年同期增产两倍多。
    夏汛生产主要是在近海内海捕捞小杂鱼，单位产量较小。一些较大的渔业生产单位，过去在春汛结束后，就“歇海”来修船补网，等到秋冬汛再出海。今年，在无产阶级文化大革命的推动下，广大渔民提出要革除“歇海”的旧习惯，建立新风气，捕捞更多的鱼，供应城乡人民。他们挖掘船网工具的潜力，投入夏汛生产；同时修船补网，做秋冬汛生产的准备工作。集中在夏汛生产的主要渔场——闽南渔场的渔船，比去年增加一半以上。
