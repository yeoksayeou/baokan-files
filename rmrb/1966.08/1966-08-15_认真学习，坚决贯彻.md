The communiqué of the Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee is a communiqué that makes all revolutionaries extremely excited and greatly inspired. It is a great historical document. We, the entire revolutionary faculty, staff, and students of Peking University, fully support the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee and will definitely study and implement the spirit and resolutions of the Plenum resolutely.

The Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee was convened at a time when our country is in the midst of a surging Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Plenum summarized the experience of the previous stage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, discussed, and adopted the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." This decision is the great program for the new stage of the socialist revolution and the guarantee for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must study this decision of the Party Central Committee thoroughly, master it, and apply it. We must compare and contrast the policies and guidelines stipulated in the decision with the situation of the cultural revolution in our school during the previous period, continue what is correct, resolutely rectify what is wrong, and do what has not been done.

The Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee discussed and approved the major decisions and measures on domestic and international issues made by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee since the Tenth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee in September 1962. We firmly support and will definitely implement these major decisions and measures. Comrade Mao Zedong's correct analysis of the situation and his repeated emphasis on the theory of contradictions, classes, and class struggle in socialist society at the Tenth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee are the guiding principles for our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction. They have made the whole country a scene of revolutionary fervor and are creating a new situation of all-round leaps forward. Comrade Mao Zedong's series of brilliant decisions in the past four years, such as the strategic line of preparing for war, preventing famine, and serving the people, the policy of making every sector of the country a revolutionary school that combines work, agriculture, culture, and military affairs, and especially Chairman Mao's series of instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have greatly accelerated the development and victory of our country's socialist cause, consolidated our country's proletarian dictatorship and socialist system, prevented revisionism from usurping the leadership of the Party and the state, prevented the restoration of capitalism, ensured that our country adheres to proletarian internationalism, actively supports the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries, and ensures that our country will gradually transition to communism in the future. All these have extremely profound significance.

The Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee pointed out that we are now in a new era of world revolution. Various political forces are undergoing a great upheaval, great division, and great reorganization. The revolutionary movements of the peoples of various countries, especially the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, are flourishing. Although the development of the international situation will inevitably encounter various twists and turns, the overall trend of the collapse of imperialism and the victory of socialism throughout the world is unchangeable. Practice has proven that this judgment is completely correct. The Plenum strongly condemned the crimes of American imperialism in expanding the aggression against Vietnam. The Plenum fully agreed with all the measures and actions that our Party Central Committee and our government have agreed with the Vietnamese side on aiding Vietnam in resisting America. We fully support this.

The Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee emphasized that the whole Party and the whole nation studying the works of Comrade Mao Zedong is a major event of historical significance. Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Comrade Mao Zedong has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage. Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards world victory. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for the whole Party and the whole nation. We should, like Comrade Lin Biao's call to the whole army, love and study Chairman Mao's works. With the development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we should launch a mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in our school, truly making Mao Zedong Thought our guiding principle for the cultural revolution.

Looking back at the tremendous development and changes in our country over the past few years, practice has proven that our Party is a proletarian revolutionary party that has gone through the most intense, most arduous, longest, and most complex struggles in history. Our people are great people. Our country is a great country. Our army is a great army. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, we will definitely be able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, definitely be able to fulfill the mission entrusted to us by history, and definitely not disappoint the expectations of the revolutionary people of the whole world. We, the entire revolutionary faculty, staff, and students of Peking University, resolutely respond to the call of the Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite all those who can be united, overcome obstacles from all aspects of counter-revolutionary revisionism and "left" and "right" opportunism, overcome difficulties, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, carry the socialist revolution through to the end, strive for the realization of the Third Five-Year Plan, and strive to build our country into a powerful socialist country!

Long live the Communist Party of China!

Long live the great and wise leader Chairman Mao!

　　认真学习，坚决贯彻
　　北京大学文化革命委员会筹委会主任　聂元梓
    八届十一中全会公报，是使一切革命的人们无比振奋、无限鼓舞的公报，是一个伟大的历史文献。我们北大全体革命师生员工完全拥护八届十一中全会公报，并且一定要认真学习和坚决贯彻公报的精神和全会的决议。
    八届十一中全会，是在我国正处在轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中召开的，全会总结了前一段无产阶级文化大革命的经验，讨论并通过了《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》。这个决定是社会主义革命新阶段的伟大纲领，是无产阶级文化大革命的胜利保证。我们一定要认真地学习党中央这个决定，学习它，精通它，运用它，要把决定中规定的方针、政策，同我校前一个时期文化革命的情况，进行对照、比较，对的就继续照办，错的就坚决改正，还没有做的就要去做。
    八届十一中全会讨论和批准了一九六二年九月八届十中全会以来中央政治局关于国内和国际问题的重大决策和重大措施，我们坚决拥护和一定要贯彻执行这些重大决策和重大措施。毛泽东同志在八届十中全会上对形势所作的正确分析和再一次强调的关于社会主义社会的矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争的理论，是我国进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的指南，它使全国到处出现了一片热气腾腾的革命景象和正在出现新的全面跃进的局面。毛泽东同志近四年来提出的一系列英明决策，如关于贯彻执行民主集中制，发扬群众路线的革命传统的问题，关于培养和造就无产阶级革命事业接班人，关于备战备荒为人民的战略方针，关于把全国各行各业办成亦工亦农、亦文亦武的革命化大学校，等等，特别是毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列指示，对于大大加快我国社会主义事业的发展和胜利，对于巩固我国无产阶级专政和社会主义制度，防止修正主义篡夺党和国家的领导，防止资本主义复辟，保证我国坚持无产阶级国际主义，积极支持世界各国人民的革命斗争，保证我国将来逐步过渡到共产主义，具有极为深远的意义。
    八届十一中全会指出，当前正处在世界革命的一个新时代。各种政治力量正在经历着一个大动荡、大分化、大改组的局面。各国人民的革命运动，特别是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的革命运动，正在蓬勃发展。尽管国际形势的发展不可避免地会出现各种曲折和反复，但是，帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的总趋势，是改变不了的。实践证明，这种论断是完全正确的。全会最强烈地谴责美帝国主义扩大侵略越南战争的罪行，全会完全同意我党中央和我国政府同越南方面商定的关于援越抗美的一切措施和将要采取的行动。我们对此完全拥护。
    八届十一中全会强调指出，全党全民大学毛泽东同志著作，是一个具有历史意义的重大事件。毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东同志天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃、社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是全党全民的指导方针。我们要像林彪同志号召全军那样，热爱和学习毛主席著作。随着无产阶级文化大革命的开展，在我校进一步掀起一个活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，真正把毛泽东思想作为我们文化革命的行动指南。
    回顾这几年我们国家的巨大发展、变化，实践证明，我们的党是经历了历史上最激烈、最艰苦、最长期、最复杂斗争的无产阶级革命党。我们的人民是伟大的人民。我们的国家是伟大的国家。我们的军队是伟大的军队。我们坚信，在伟大的领袖毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，我们一定能够战胜一切困难和障碍，一定能完成历史赋予我们的使命，一定不辜负全世界革命人民对我们的期望。我们北大全体革命师生员工坚决响应八届十一中全会的号召，更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，团结一切可以团结的人们，克服从反革命修正主义和“左”右倾机会主义诸方面来的阻力，战胜困难，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把社会主义革命进行到底，为实现第三个五年计划，为把我国建设成一个强大的社会主义国家而奋斗！
    中国共产党万岁！
    伟大英明的领袖毛主席万岁！
