Resolutely support the revolutionary actions of revolutionary students and resolutely sweep away the decayed customs of the exploiting classes. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the capital enthusiastically acclaim that the Red Guards are doing well. Revolutionary masses are posting big-character posters, holding symposiums, writing letters of support, and vowing to be the backbone of the revolutionary youngsters. Many workers are launching a fierce offensive against the old ideas, old styles, old methods, and old systems in their factories.

Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd: The broad masses of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants in the capital most enthusiastically and resolutely support the Red Guards' fierce assault on all the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes. They are posting big-character posters, holding symposiums, writing letters of support, and sending articles to newspapers, vowing to be the backbone of the revolutionary youngsters and determined to thoroughly transform Beijing into a city that is extremely proletarian and extremely revolutionary.

Revolutionary workers in the newly renamed main streets have posted countless big-character posters supporting the Red Guards. They also took to the streets, beating drums and gongs, holding up large banners, and shouting slogans to express their resolute support for the revolutionary actions of the young revolutionaries. In front of the building newly renamed "Beijing Department Store," a giant banner several stories high hangs, reading: "Resolutely support the revolutionary actions of revolutionary students!" "Salute to the revolutionary youngsters!"

In the Beijing Steel Factory, workers have posted big-character posters in the workshops, dining halls, and on the walls, reading: "Support the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards!" "Long live the revolutionary spirit of the proletarian rebellion!" "Thoroughly smash all old systems!" Many workers, inspired by the revolutionary students, further carried forward the spirit of daring to think, dare to do, and dare to rebel. They launched a new fierce offensive against all obstacles to revolution and shackles on production in the factory, proposing many revolutionary suggestions and immediately starting reforms. Some old workers in Workshop One said: Some people say the actions of the revolutionary students are "unreasonable." We say they are very reasonable. The revolutionary students are doing the right thing, doing it well! We, all the workers, resolutely support them! Old things are deeply rooted, so we need such a revolutionary storm to overthrow them!

"Resolutely learn the revolutionary spirit of rebellion from the Red Guards and sweep away all ghosts and monsters." This has been the main topic of discussion among many workers in the Beijing Second Cotton Textile Mill in recent days. They sing revolutionary songs created by revolutionary students, post big-character posters and revolutionary leaflets, hold symposiums, and launch fierce attacks on all old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits. The workers believe that everyone has the right to sweep away the old forces, not only on the streets and storefronts but also within factories and all other enterprises and institutions, and in the depths of one's soul. Workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary students and cadres should unite to sweep, sweep continuously, so that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution can achieve a thorough victory.

In the Beijing Synthetic Fiber Experimental Factory of the Chemical Industry Department, old workers rejoice in having such reliable revolutionary successors as the Red Guards, and young workers are inspired by having such revolutionary comrades full of revolutionary vigor. They say: The Red Guards listen to Chairman Mao's words the most and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Their revolutionary actions are unstoppable by any force. We must learn their revolutionary spirit, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Some workers in the factory, inspired by the revolutionary spirit of the Red Guards, chopped down the "福" character on the gate of their residential courtyard, which contains feudal ideas, and posted red couplets reading "Smash the old world and build a new world," with a horizontal scroll reading "Revolution."

The workers of the Beijing Automobile Branch Company believe that the revolutionary youngsters' rebellion is justified and beneficial to socialism. Things that had not been overthrown for more than a decade under the protection of the former Municipal Committee have been swept away by the revolutionary torrent in just a few days. This is another great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. They enthusiastically support the revolutionary spirit of the youngsters with actions, with some helping the Red Guards read appeals to fiercely attack old customs and habits on public buses, and others joining the Red Guards to launch struggles.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the suburban rural areas were greatly inspired after learning from newspapers and broadcasts about the revolutionary students' actions to break with the old and establish the new. The poor and lower-middle peasant members of the Huangtugang Production Brigade in the Huangtugang People's Commune of Fengtai District said: Revolutionary students and Red Guards are the most reliable red successors of the revolutionary cause. Seeing their revolutionary actions, we are delighted from the bottom of our hearts. We poor and lower-middle peasants must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely support the revolutionary students, and unite closely with them to sweep away all ghosts and monsters and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

According to Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd: The broad revolutionary students, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have launched a great revolutionary action to sweep away all the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes, which has inspired the broad masses of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing. They expressed their determination to stand on the side of the revolutionary students, resolutely support the revolutionary actions of the revolutionary students, and launch a fierce offensive against bourgeois and all exploiting class ideas, carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The officers and soldiers of the PLA stationed in Beijing highly praised the revolutionary actions of the Beijing Red Guards in fiercely attacking the ideological, cultural, and habitual forces of the bourgeoisie. They said this revolutionary action is another manifestation of the great material force that Mao Zedong Thought, once armed with revolutionary masses, will produce. This revolutionary action is excellent. The representatives of the active study of Chairman Mao's works conference of a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region jointly wrote a letter praising the revolutionary students' revolutionary actions of breaking with the old and establishing the new, greatly boosting the morale of the proletariat and greatly demoralizing all exploiting classes. The scale, momentum, power, and momentum of the youngsters' revolutionary actions fully demonstrate their revolutionary vigor and courage and determination to smash the old world and build a new world. Air Force officer Wang Mingqi wrote an article praising the Beijing Red Guards' actions of breaking with the old and establishing the new, calling it a great revolutionary cleanup. They sweep away all the decayed things of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, which is truly heartening. Naval Aviation Corps officer Bao Ximing, who shot down a U.S.-made Nationalist aircraft and was awarded the Second-Class Merit Citation, told a reporter from this newspaper, "The revolutionary actions of the Red Guards are actions of listening to Chairman Mao's words and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, thoroughly making a revolution. They are doing the right thing, doing it well! In the past, revolutionary predecessors, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, defeated the Japanese invaders, overthrew the Chiang Kai-shek regime, and established New China. Today, the revolutionary youngsters have inherited the revolutionary spirit of rebellion from their revolutionary predecessors, with thunderous force, breaking with the "four olds" and establishing the "four news," establishing Mao Zedong Thought, and letting Mao Zedong Thought illuminate every corner."

The officers and soldiers of the PLA stationed in Beijing expressed their determination to stand firmly on the side of the revolutionary students, most enthusiastically and resolutely support the revolutionary actions of the revolutionary students. The officers and soldiers of the 12th Company of a certain unit of the Beijing Garrison Command seriously studied "Investigation on the Peasant Movement in Hunan" and the editorial of the People's Daily, holding symposiums, saying that the youngsters' revolutionary actions are the same as the revolutionary movement of the Hunan peasants in the past. They smashed an old world and built a new one. The entire company expressed their determination to support the revolutionary actions of the youngsters. The leading organ of the Railway Engineering Corps, at today's celebration meeting for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, many officers and soldiers expressed in their speeches their most resolute support for the actions of the revolutionary students. They said, the People's Liberation Army is the people's army created by Chairman Mao, we will forever be good soldiers of Chairman Mao, most resolutely support the revolutionary spirit and actions of rebellion of the revolutionary students.

The broad officers and soldiers of the PLA stationed in Beijing unanimously expressed that the People's Liberation Army and the broad masses of workers and peasants are the main forces of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and must carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. They said, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is being pushed to a new high tide. We must better study, grasp, and apply the Sixteen Articles, use the Sixteen Articles as a weapon, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, and burn the revolutionary fire of sweeping away the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes more fiercely, more powerfully, thoroughly burn down the old world, and establish a brand-new proletarian new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits, and let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high on all ideological fronts.

    广大革命职工在新改名的主要街道上，贴出了数不清的支持红卫兵的大字报；他们并走上街头游行，敲锣打鼓，高举大幅标语，高呼口号，表示坚决支持革命小将的革命行动。在刚改名为“北京市百货商店”的大楼前，悬挂着几层楼高的巨大标语，上面写着：“坚决支持革命学生的革命行动！”“向革命小将致敬！”
    在北京钢厂，车间里、饭厅里、墙壁上，工人们贴出了“支持红卫兵的革命行动！”“无产阶级造反精神万岁！”“彻底打碎一切旧制度”等许多大字报。许多工人在革命学生的鼓舞下，进一步发扬敢想、敢干、敢革命的精神，向本厂存在的一切障碍革命、束缚生产的旧思想、旧作风、旧方法、旧制度发动了新的猛烈攻势，提出了很多革命建议，并且立即着手改革。一车间一些炼钢老工人说：有人说革命学生的行动“不像话”，我们说很像话，革命学生干得对，干得好！我们全体工人坚决支持！旧的东西，根深蒂固，就得要有这样的革命暴风雨，才能打倒！
      “坚决学习红卫兵的革命造反精神，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。”这是北京第二棉纺织厂许多工人这几天议论的主题。他们高唱革命学生创作的《革命造反歌》，贴大字报和革命传单，开座谈会，向一切旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯发动猛烈攻击。工人们认为，对于旧势力，人人都有权利扫掉它，不仅在大街上扫，在门面上扫，还要在工厂和其他一切企业、机关内部扫，在思想灵魂深处扫，工农兵和革命学生、革命干部联合起来扫，不断地扫，这样，无产阶级文化大革命才能取得彻底胜利。

    北京汽车分公司的工人们认为，革命小将们造反有理，对社会主义有利。在前市委包庇下十几年没打倒的旧东西，现在几天之内就被革命洪流冲掉，这是毛泽东思想的又一次伟大胜利。他们纷纷以行动来热情支持革命小将们的造反精神，有的在公共汽车上帮助红卫兵朗读向旧风俗旧习惯猛烈开火的呼吁书，有的和红卫兵们联合起来展开斗争。

    驻京部队指战员热烈赞扬首都红卫兵革命学生猛烈攻击资产阶级意识形态、旧风俗、旧习惯势力的伟大革命行动是毛泽东思想一旦武装起革命群众就会产生伟大的物质力量的又一体现。这种革命行动好得很。北京部队某部出席学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的全体代表，联名写信赞扬革命学生这种破旧立新的革命行动，大长无产阶级的志气，大灭一切剥削阶级的威风。小将们的革命行动规模之大，声势之壮，威力之强，来势之猛，正表现了他们意气风发的革命朝气以及打碎旧世界、创建新世界的勇气和决心。空军某部王鸣岐写文章，赞扬首都红卫兵破旧立新的行动，是一次革命的大扫除，他们横扫一切封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的腐朽的东西，真是大快人心。曾经击落美制蒋机荣立二等战功的海军航空兵某部保锡明对本社记者说，红卫兵的革命行动，是他们听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，彻底闹革命的行动。他们做得对，做得好！过去，革命前辈们在伟大领袖毛主席英明领导下，打垮了日本侵略者，推翻了蒋家王朝，建立了新中国。今天，革命小将们继承了革命前辈的革命造反精神，以雷霆万钧之势，大破“四旧”，大立“四新”，大立毛泽东思想，让毛泽东思想照亮每一个角落。
    驻京部队的指战员们表示，人民解放军坚定地站在革命学生一边，最热烈最坚决地支持革命学生的革命行动。北京卫戍部队某部十二连指战员，认真学习了《湖南农民运动考察报告》和《人民日报》社论，纷纷举行座谈，大家说，小将们的革命行动，和当年湖南农民的革命运动一样，他们打碎的是一个旧世界，建设起来的将是一个新世界。全连指战员表示，坚决支持小将们的革命行动。铁道兵领导机关在今天举行的庆祝无产阶级文化大革命的大会上，许多指战员在讲话中表示，最坚决地支持革命学生的行动。他们说，人民解放军是毛主席亲手缔造的人民军队，我们永远作毛主席的好战士，最坚决地支持革命学生的革命造反精神和行动。
