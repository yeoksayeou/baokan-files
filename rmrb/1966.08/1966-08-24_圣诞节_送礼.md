Christmas "Gifts"

In the winter of 1952, to the east of the Malyang Mountain battlefield in Korea, there was an American aggressor's forward camp. The American devils in this camp, relying on their superior firepower, were once rampant. They would come out in broad daylight for drills, dancing, and revelry. The enemy thought that with airplanes bombing from above and artillery sealing off the ground, our machine guns and small cannons couldn't reach them, and our artillery couldn't be brought up. They thought they were invincible. Seeing this, the soldiers were so angry that their lungs were about to burst. Everyone gnashed their teeth, wishing they could punch these dog thieves to smithereens.

Just as the American devils were preparing to celebrate Christmas, our superiors ordered our artillery regiment to send them some "gifts." Instantly, the entire regiment was in an uproar, and the gunners were overjoyed, jumping with excitement. Everyone said: This time, we must let the American devils taste our strength. However, to secretly transport the artillery to the front line, there was no road to take. Thus, the cadres and soldiers came up with many clever ideas, finally deciding to blaze a trail along two small gullies that were less likely to be detected by the enemy. The soldiers poured their deep hatred for American imperialism into their hammers and pickaxes. They worked on the road at night and camouflaged it during the day, building and camouflaging a section at a time. After working for nine consecutive nights, a five-li-long road was completed without the enemy knowing. At the same time as building the road, Commander Wang Mingxi led the reconnaissance team, crawling through ice and snow, hiding near the enemy's front line, and thoroughly understanding the enemy's activities. Soon, we overcame one difficulty after another and pulled the artillery into the hidden position.

On Christmas morning, the enemy was assembling on the parade ground when a barrage of shells exploded above their heads. The enemy's position was filled with thick smoke, and bodies were scattered everywhere. An entire enemy camp was sent to meet their "God." Then, the enemy sent twelve trucks to retrieve the bodies, and we sent another volley of shells. Eight trucks caught fire instantly, and the remaining four, seeing the situation was bad, fled with their tails between their legs. After the battle, we quickly withdrew from the position. By the time the enemy's planes came to scout, they couldn't even find our shadows.

After this battle, the enemy no longer dared to boast or show off. They hid in their bunkers during the day, not daring to show their heads, and at night, they crawled in the trenches. Seeing the enemy's cowardly appearance, our soldiers said: American imperialism is indeed a paper tiger exposed.

    圣诞节“送礼”
    前志愿军某炮团副政委　康俊玉
    一九五二年冬季，朝鲜马良山阵地以东，驻着美国侵略军的一个前卫营。这个营的美国鬼子，仗恃着优势炮火，猖狂一时。在大白天就出来上操、跳舞，寻欢作乐。敌人以为他们天上有飞机轰炸，地上有炮火封锁，我们的机枪、小炮够不着它，火炮又运不上来，对他们没办法。看到这种情况，战士们肺都快气炸了。大家咬牙切齿，恨不得一拳头把这些狗强盗砸个稀巴烂。
    正当美国鬼子张罗着过圣诞节的时候，上级要我们这个炮兵团给他们送点“礼物”去。顿时，全团上下沸腾起来，炮手们个个喜得一蹦三尺高。大家说：这回可得请美国佬尝尝咱们的厉害了。但是，要把火炮秘密地运到前沿去，没有路可走。于是，干部、战士想出了很多巧点子，最后决定沿着两条不易被敌人发现的小山沟，劈石开道。战士们把对美帝国主义的深仇大恨，都集中在铁锤与钢钎上。夜晚修路，白天伪装，修一段，伪装一段。接连干了九个夜晚，一条五华里长的道路神不知鬼不觉地修好了。在修路的同时，指挥排长王明喜带着侦察员，爬冰卧雪，潜伏在敌人前沿附近，把美国鬼子的活动规律摸了个一清二楚。不久，我们终于克服了一个个困难，把火炮拉进了隐蔽阵地。
    圣诞节早晨，敌人正在操场上集合，一群炮弹在他们头上开了花。炸得敌人阵地浓烟腾空，血肉横飞，一个营的敌人就迷迷糊糊地见“上帝”去了。接着敌人又开来了十二辆拖尸的卡车，我们又送去一排炮弹，八辆汽车顿时着了火，其余四辆见势不妙，夹着尾巴逃跑了。战斗结束后，我们迅速地撤离阵地。等敌人飞机飞来侦察时，连我们的影子也没见着。
    这一仗之后，敌人再也不敢吹牛皮、抖“威风”了。他们白天龟缩在地堡里不敢露头，晚上，在战壕里爬行。我们的战士们见到敌人这副熊包样，都说：美帝国主义真是纸老虎现了原形。
