Peasants from ten ethnic minorities in the production frontline of Heilongjiang Province brought the hearts of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to the "Summer in Harbin" concert in 1966. They sang and danced enthusiastically, praising the great Party and expressing their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao. The peasants from these ten ethnic minorities held two special performances at the concert, presenting nearly seventy items. Many of these were created during the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Lü He, a 53-year-old representative of the National People's Congress and a famous agricultural labor model, made his first appearance on stage. He sang enthusiastically with the other peasants, performing "The Taiping Brigade is Marching Forward." The Taiping Brigade is a production brigade in Zhongxing People's Commune, Gannan County, Heilongjiang Province. Under Lü He's leadership, the brigade members have earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's call to "learn from Dazhai in agriculture." With the revolutionary spirit of "daring to change the heavens and earth," they have transformed a low-yield area that suffered drought for nine out of ten years into a high-yield, stable production brigade. They are praised as the "Dazhai of the Northeast." Their struggle is a triumphant song of Mao Zedong Thought. The peasants sang loudly on stage: "Mao Zedong Thought shines with golden light, the three red banners fly high, self-reliance creates great undertakings, the Northeast Dazhai presents a new scene."

Song Ranhao, a Korean ethnic peasant, is a revolutionary warrior of the proletariat with a firm will despite his physical disabilities. During the Korean War, he lost both hands in a fierce battle. However, under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, he overcame numerous difficulties, learned to work and write with artificial hands, and became a skilled worker in production and a pioneer in the cultural revolution. This time, he and his companions performed the powerful song "Sunflowers Turn Toward the Sun," which he himself wrote. As he sang, he became more and more excited, and finally waved his artificial hands, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" The audience below also shouted in unison, "Long live Chairman Mao!" The shouts echoed throughout the venue.

Yu Yucheng, a representative of the Hezhe ethnic group, one of the smallest ethnic groups in China residing in the Sanjiang Plain, also participated in this concert. The song "Remembering Bitterness and Sweetness, Opposing the Black Line," created and performed by Yu Yucheng, reflects the miserable scenes of this ethnic group under the Japanese puppet regime and their happy life after liberation. As he sang this song, he was deeply moved and expressed his strongest resolve to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end. He sang, "The Hezhe people raise their fists and roar in anger, angrily denouncing the enemy, digging out the black line and smashing the black shop, not retreating until complete victory is achieved!"

Bo Shuxian, a female peasant of the Orogen ethnic group, danced and sang, "The Orogen people have Chairman Mao, we can change the sky and the earth, for thousands of years we did not know how to farm and sow, now we drive tractors; the golden wheat sea waves, electric lights shine in our new village, bright in front of our eyes and warm in our hearts, we will never forget Chairman Mao."

The peasants who performed at this concert include the Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, Korean, Daur, Orogen, Evenk, Kyrgyz, and Hezhe ethnic groups. This was an unprecedented musical festival where ethnic peasants from Heilongjiang Province gathered to praise the Party and Chairman Mao in unison.

    在“哈尔滨之夏”音乐会上倾吐贫下中农心意
    十个民族公社社员同声歌颂毛主席
    据新华社哈尔滨电  来自黑龙江省农业生产第一线的十个民族的人民公社社员，带着广大贫下中农的心意，在一九六六年“哈尔滨之夏”音乐会上，高歌欢舞，同声歌颂伟大的党，倾吐了对伟大领袖毛主席的无比热爱。这十个民族的农民社员在音乐会上举行了两次专场演出，上演了近七十个节目。其中有许多是他们在当前无产阶级文化大革命中创作的。
    五十三岁的全国人民代表大会代表、著名的农业劳动模范吕和，第一次登上舞台，和社员们一起纵情歌唱《太平大队在前进》。太平大队是黑龙江省甘南县中兴公社的一个大队，这个大队的社员在吕和带领下，认真贯彻了毛主席提出的“农业学大寨”的伟大号召，用“敢教日月换新天”的革命精神，把一个十年九旱的低产地区，建设成一个稳产高产的丰收大队，被誉为东北地区的大寨。他们这段斗争历史，就是一曲毛泽东思想的凯歌。社员们在音乐会上高声歌唱：“毛泽东思想闪金光，三面红旗高高飘扬，自力更生创大业，东北大寨一片新气象。”
    朝鲜族社员宋然浩是一个身残志坚的无产阶级革命战士。他在抗美援朝的一次激烈的战斗中，被敌人夺去了双手。但是，他在毛泽东思想哺育下，克服了许许多多困难，用假手学会了劳动、写字，成为生产上的能手，文化革命中的闯将。这次他和他的同伴在会上表演了由他自己作词的《葵花向太阳》这首气势磅礴的歌曲。他在演唱时越唱越激动，最后挥动假手，高呼“毛主席万岁！”台下观众也同声欢呼，“毛主席万岁！”的欢呼声响彻全场。
    居住在三江平原的我国人数最少的民族——赫哲族，也派出了社员尤玉成等为代表，参加了这届音乐会。由尤玉成创作并参加演出的《忆苦思甜反黑线》一歌，反映了这个民族在日伪统治时期濒于灭亡的惨景，以及解放后的幸福生活。他在演唱这首歌时感情激动，表示了把文化大革命进行到底的最坚强的决心。他唱道：“赫哲人挥拳齐怒吼，愤怒声讨死对头，挖掉黑线砸黑店，不获全胜兵不收！”
    鄂伦春族女社员葛淑贤边舞边唱：“鄂家人有了毛主席，能改天来能换地，几千年来不懂耕和种，如今咱开起了拖拉机；金黄的麦海翻波浪，电灯送到咱新村里，亮在眼前暖在心，念念不忘毛主席。”
    在这届音乐会上演出的社员，包括汉、满、蒙古、回、朝鲜、达斡尔、鄂伦春、鄂温克、柯尔克孜、赫哲等民族。这是黑龙江省各民族社员欢聚一堂，同声歌颂党和毛主席的一次空前的音乐盛会。
