Comrade Mao Zedong often tells us that all revolutionaries, all revolutionary youth, should face the wind and rain, see the world. Revolutionaries cannot grow in a greenhouse; they must temper themselves in the storms and waves.

When we learn to swim, we do not learn first and then get into the water. Instead, we learn to swim while swimming.

When we engage in revolution, we do not learn first and then act. Instead, we learn while doing, and learn more as we do. Doing is learning.

Every revolutionary, every revolutionary youth, should actively participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, learn to fight class struggles in the midst of struggles, and become true disciples of Chairman Mao, successors to the cause of proletarian revolution.

Marx said: "To learn to walk, one must also learn to fall, and only by falling can one learn to walk."

Lu Xun also said: "The first step a child takes in learning to walk appears, to adults, to be clumsy, dangerous, and unsteady, or even ridiculous. But even the most ignorant woman always watches her child take this first step with sincere and hopeful heart."

Revolution is not an easy task. To achieve revolutionary victory, one must overcome all obstacles and difficulties. Revolutionary youth must roll in the mud of the masses thousands and thousands of times, endure thousands and thousands of tests in struggle, and withstand all possible setbacks.

Comrade Mao Zedong says that we should never leave the masses. In this way, we can understand the masses, be with the masses, and serve the people well.

Never forget that we are all children of the people, raised by the toil and sweat of the working people. Never forget this. Always remember that the working people are our fathers and mothers. We must respectfully be the children of the people, the students of the people, always with the masses, always thinking of the masses.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must study Chairman Mao Zedong's works and the Sixteen Points thoroughly. Only by mastering the great ideological weapon of Mao Zedong Thought can we successfully wage this struggle. Only by learning in the struggle can we truly master Mao Zedong Thought.

We must continuously reform ourselves in the struggle, learning and reforming until old age. Only then can we make the necessary and possible contributions to our country and the cause of proletarian revolution.

Under the sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought, bravely fight in the surging Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

　　在游泳中学会游泳
    毛泽东同志经常告诉我们，一切革命者，一切革命青年，都应该经风雨，见世面。革命者不可能在温室里成长，要在大风大浪里去锻炼自己。
    我们学游泳，不是学好了再下水，而是在游泳中学会游泳。
    我们干革命，也不是学好了再干，而是在干中学习，干起来再学习。干就是学习。
    每个革命者，每个革命青年，都要积极地参加无产阶级文化大革命，在斗争中学会进行阶级斗争的本领，使自己能够真正做毛主席的好学生，做无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    马克思说：“人要学会走路，也得学会摔跤，而且只有经过摔跤他才能学会走路。”
    鲁迅也说过：“孩子初学步的第一步，在成人看来，的确是幼稚，危险，不成样子，或者简直是可笑的。但无论怎样的愚妇人，却总以恳切的希望的心，看他跨出这第一步去”。
    革命是一件不容易的事，要取得革命胜利，必须战胜一切阻力，克服一切困难。革命的青年们要在群众的泥巴里滚过千百万次，经得起千百万次斗争的考验，经得起一切可能的意外的挫折。
    毛泽东同志说，我们任何时候都不要离开群众。这样，我们就可能知道群众，了解群众，同群众一道，也就可能好好地为人民服务。
    永远不要忘记，我们都是人民的儿子，都是劳动人民用血汗把我们养大的。千万不要忘记这点。千万要记得劳动人民是我们的父亲，是我们的母亲。我们要恭恭敬敬地做人民的儿子，做人民的学生，永远永远同人民群众在一起，时时刻刻都要想到人民群众。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们要好好学习毛泽东同志的著作，好好学习十六条。只有掌握毛泽东思想这个伟大的精神武器，才能胜利地进行这场斗争。也只有在斗争中学习，才能把毛泽东思想真正学到手。
    我们要在斗争中不断地改造自己，做到老，学到老，改造到老。这样，我们才能对祖国，对无产阶级革命事业，做出自己必要的可能的贡献。
    在毛泽东思想的阳光照耀下，勇敢地在波澜壮阔的文化大革命的激流中战斗吧！
