Hubei Province's ramie production areas, after achieving a bumper harvest of the first crop, have now secured a bumper harvest of the second crop.

This year, the ramie planting area in the province has expanded by more than twenty percent compared to last year. The people in the ramie-growing areas, amidst the high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, have come to understand the principle of growing ramie for the revolution. They link the task of growing and managing ramie well with supporting national construction and the world revolution. Last winter, various ramie-growing areas paid attention to strengthening fertilization and soil mounding for the ramie stalks, laying a solid foundation for this year's bumper ramie harvest.

    为革命为国家精耕细作
    湖北苎麻接连获得增产
    湖北省苎麻产区在夺得头麻丰收以后，又夺得二麻丰收。
    今年，全省苎麻面积比去年扩大了百分之二十以上。麻区社员在群众性活学活用毛主席著作高潮中，懂得种麻为革命的道理，把种好管好苎麻，同支援国家建设、支援世界革命联系起来。去年冬季各麻区就注意加强对麻蔸的施肥、壅土，为今年苎麻丰收打下良好基础。
