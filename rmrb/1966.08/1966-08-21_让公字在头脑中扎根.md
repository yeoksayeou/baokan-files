Chairman Mao has taught us: "Mastering ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole Party to wage great political struggles. If this task is not accomplished, the Party's political tasks cannot be completed." To educate Party members, we must arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, helping them establish a clear class perspective and a perspective on class struggle. This way, everyone can prioritize the public interest, break away from the bourgeois worldview, and embrace the communist worldview. Only then can we enhance the Party's combat effectiveness, ensure the Party branches act as strongholds, and guarantee the successful completion of the Party's great tasks.

The Zhujian Commune Zhongli Production Brigade Party branch once relaxed its efforts in promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology within the Party, focusing solely on production and business matters, which led to a backward situation. By the end of 1962, the Party branch organized all Party members to seriously study the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, beginning to grasp the key issue of class struggle. In early 1963, with the help of the county committee's work team, the Party branch summarized the experiences and lessons from the previous few years of not focusing on class struggle and political ideological work, and not managing the Party. They shifted from focusing only on "grain, vegetables, and fruit" and not distinguishing between "enemies, friends, and ourselves" to focusing on class struggle and Party member education, which meant intensively studying Chairman Mao's works. Over the past three years, the branch has emphasized using proletarian worldviews to educate and transform Party members, cadres, and the masses, greatly solidifying their socialist direction and changing their spiritual outlook. The vast majority of Party members have continuously overcome the "self" and established the "public," fostering a mindset of wholeheartedly serving the people. When faced with any issue, they prioritize the public interest over personal gain, placing the Party's interests, revolutionary interests, and the interests of the masses above personal interests. For example, the branch secretary, Ni Wenfu, saw that the team lacked a warehouse and voluntarily gave up his own house to be used as a collective warehouse. Party member Ni Shoukang, to help a backward team change its situation, willingly moved from the tenth team, which had relatively high income, to the fifth team, which had relatively low income. The masses praised him as a good Party member who dared to "jump from the rice basket to the husk basket."

Because Party members always prioritize the public interest, they have influenced and led the broad masses. Loving the collective, practicing selflessness, and helping others have become the norm in this brigade. Although the Party branch did not directly focus on production and business, by grasping the root—arming the broad Party members and masses with Mao Zedong Thought and making them consciously engage in the struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology—the broad Party members have broadened their horizons, unified their ranks, and enhanced their combat effectiveness, greatly promoting production and construction. This approach is much more effective and yields greater results than directly focusing on production and business. The facts are clear: only by doing this can the Party branch truly become a stronghold.

The living reality of Zhongli Brigade has given every comrade in the county committee a good lesson. Many comrades have changed their wrong idea of viewing Party building as merely an organizational department's business. Everyone has further realized that in the socialist period, class struggle is still intense, and the struggle between socialism and capitalism is extremely sharp and long-term. This class struggle and the struggle between the two roads in society inevitably reflect within the Party. This is an objective law of class struggle. If we relax Party work and view Party building as merely an organizational department's business, we are essentially denying class struggle and failing to understand the extreme importance of using proletarian thought to overcome bourgeois thought and using the communist worldview to overcome bourgeois individualistic worldviews. This itself is the beginning of peaceful evolution.

The county committee's awareness has improved, and the entire county committee's work has undergone a transformation. In the three great revolutionary movements, we intensively focus on Party building and actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works. In the past, Party congresses did not discuss ideological work or Party building but focused solely on production. Now, we have changed the direction. In Party congresses, we specifically study Party building, discuss class struggle, and share experiences on organizing Party members to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works. This approach has been welcomed by the representatives and has produced good results.

The fundamental difference between the proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview is that the former is for the public, while the latter is for personal gain. Therefore, educating all Party members, cadres, and the masses to prioritize the public interest, prioritize revolution, and prioritize the people is the direction of our political work. The county committee must learn to focus on Party building in the context of class struggle. The most fundamental aspect is to instill Mao Zedong Thought into the broad Party members, making the proletarian spirit of "public" take root, bloom, and bear fruit in their minds. This way, they can truly play a leading role in maintaining and developing the collective economy and walking the socialist path.

    让公字在头脑中扎根
    浙江省上虞县县委书记  朱孔宇
    毛主席教导我们说：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”对党员进行思想教育，就是要用毛泽东思想武装他们的头脑，使他们树立起明确的阶级和阶级斗争的观点，使人人做到公字当头，破资产阶级世界观，立共产主义世界观。这样，才能增强党的队伍的战斗力，发挥党支部的战斗堡垒作用，保证党的伟大任务的胜利完成。
    娥江公社中利大队党支部，过去一度放松了在党内进行兴无灭资的斗争，只抓生产、业务，因而处于落后状况。一九六二年底，党支部组织全体党员认真地学习了党的八届十中全会公报，开始抓了阶级斗争这个纲。一九六三年初，党支部又在县委工作组的帮助下，总结了前几年不抓阶级斗争、不抓政治思想工作、党不管党的经验教训，从只抓“粮、菜、果”，不分“敌、友、我”，转到抓阶级斗争，抓党员教育上来，也就是大抓毛主席著作的学习。三年来，这个支部强调用无产阶级世界观教育和改造党员、干部和群众，大大地坚定了他们的社会主义方向，改变了他们的精神面貌。绝大多数党员不断斗倒“我”字，树立“公”字，树立起全心全意为人民服务的思想，人人争做好事。一事当前，不是为私，而是为公，不是以个人利益为重，而是以党的利益、革命的利益、群众的利益为重。如支部书记倪文甫，看到队里缺仓库，把自己的房子让出来给集体当仓库。党员倪寿康，为了帮助后进队改变面貌，甘愿从收入比较高的十队到收入比较低的五队落户。群众称赞他是敢于“从米箩里跳到糠箩里”的好党员。
    由于党员事事“以公为重”，也就影响和带动了广大群众。热爱集体，克己奉公，助人为乐，在这个大队已蔚然成风。党支部虽然没有直接去抓生产和业务，但由于它抓住了根本——用毛泽东思想武装广大党员和群众的头脑，使他们自觉地进行兴无灭资的斗争，因而广大党员眼光开阔了，队伍整齐了，战斗力增强了，就大大推动了生产建设。这种做法，比起过去直接抓生产，抓业务，见效快得多，收获大得多。事实非常清楚，只有这样做，党支部才能真正成为战斗的堡垒。
    中利大队活生生的现实，给县委每个同志上了很好的一课，很多同志改变了把党的建设单纯看成是组织部门的业务的错误想法。大家进一步认识到，在社会主义时期，阶级斗争仍然是很激烈的，社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争是极其尖锐的，并且是长期的。这种社会上的阶级斗争、两条道路斗争，不可避免地要反映到党内来。这是阶级斗争的客观规律。如果放松了党的工作，把党的建设只看成是组织部门的业务工作，实际上就是否认阶级斗争，不懂得用无产阶级思想去战胜资产阶级思想、用共产主义世界观去战胜资产阶级个人主义世界观的极端重要性，这本身就是和平演变的开始。
    县委认识提高了，整个县委工作来了一个转变。我们在三大革命运动中大抓党的建设，大抓活学活用毛主席著作。过去在党代会上，不讲思想工作，不讲党的建设，专讲生产；现在把方向转变过来了。我们在党代会上专门研究党的建设，讲阶级斗争，交流怎样组织党员活学活用毛主席著作的经验。这样做，受到代表的欢迎，产生了良好的效果。
    无产阶级世界观和资产阶级世界观最本质的区别：前者是为公，后者是为私。因此，教育全县党员、干部和群众，一心为公，一心为革命，一心为人民，这是我们政治工作的方向。县委要学会在阶级斗争中抓党的建设，根本的根本，就是把毛泽东思想灌输到广大党员中去，让无产阶级的“公”字，在他们头脑里扎根、开花、结果，使他们在维护和发展集体经济、走社会主义道路方面，真正起带头作用。
