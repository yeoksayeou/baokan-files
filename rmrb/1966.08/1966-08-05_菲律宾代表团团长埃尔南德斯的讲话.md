	The majestic city of Shanghai and its heroic ten million people! Allow me, a humble representative from the Philippines, a loyal old friend of China, to pay my respects to you and convey the revolutionary greetings and good wishes of the heroic people of the Philippines.

	The world has long remembered your glorious history. You are the sacred birthplace of the great Chinese Communist Party, which was born in the radiant light of July 1, 1921. The earliest socialist uprising was nurtured in your embrace, and the brave sons and daughters of this great city were the first freedom fighters to challenge the paper tiger of capitalism and imperialism.

	Representatives from fifty-three countries and regions in Asia and Africa gathered in Beijing just a month ago for a significant meeting. Two important resolutions were passed at that meeting. The first was to fully support the struggle of the Vietnamese people against American imperialism until they achieve complete liberation and eliminate this number one evil of the contemporary world. The second was to establish a solid united front of all oppressed and peace-loving peoples of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and to launch a destructive campaign against imperialism, neo-colonialism, and their lackeys—the tyrants in the enslaved countries.

	The Asian and African writers are about to return to their respective countries to implement these resolutions on their domestic fronts. This path will not be smooth and easy, unlike the smooth, tree-lined roads we traveled from Beijing to Wuhan, from Wuhan to Yan'an, from Yan'an to Xi'an, from Xi'an to Luoyang, from Luoyang to Nanjing and Wuxi, from Wuxi to Suzhou and Hangzhou, and finally to the famous city of Shanghai. Here, we are welcomed by tens of thousands of smiling faces, warm applause, bright lights, music, flags, and flowers. On our long journey back home, we will face dangers and sacrifices. For we, the writers who wield the pen, are the revolutionary vanguards of truth and freedom. Perhaps many of us will fall along the way, becoming victims of murder and imprisonment. Fortunately, revolutionary writers know that a person can only die once, but heroes and martyrs will live forever in the hearts of their people and generations to come.

	I myself was once imprisoned for six years by the reactionary enemies who suppressed freedom in my country. On the day the Supreme Court ordered my release, the prison warden escorted me to the gate and kindly bid me farewell, saying, "Don't come back to this prison." I immediately replied, "I can't guarantee that." Because deep in my heart, I knew that the cruel six years behind bars had not extinguished my revolutionary spirit. Therefore, they will surely plot to imprison me again or kill me. Let them worry about that. Only those who are not afraid of death are fit to live in freedom and dignity.

	The American imperialists are like wounded bulls in a Mexican bullring, rampaging wildly. They are brutally dragging the entire world into a full-scale war. The mad trio of Johnson, Rusk, and McNamara are becoming increasingly bloodthirsty. They are not satisfied with the continued slaughter of innocent civilians, including women and children, in the artificially created region south of the 17th parallel. They have already escalated the war to the heart and body of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam—Hanoi and Haiphong. These madmen are proud of their crimes, which can be compared to hell. They impose tyrannical rule over the oppressed peoples of Africa and Asia and shamelessly exploit certain Latin American countries, which they label as "banana republics." They ruthlessly trample on China's lawful territory of Taiwan and maliciously encircle China with military bases and naval bases for selling war. All these despicable international banditry against the world's people must be condemned, refuted, and ultimately punished.

	As long as the American imperialists occupy Taiwan and employ the traitor Chiang Kai-shek as its jailer, the world will never forget that the bloodthirsty dealers of Wall Street and the little Hitlers of the Pentagon are the most despicable and shameful bandits in contemporary history.

	The painful lessons of Korea have not been etched into the stupid minds of these imperialists. Today, the 31 million indomitable Vietnamese people are giving them another lesson. The American bandits are ruthlessly ravaging the peaceful fields and homes of farmers. They have brought in 300,000 heavily armed troops and more cannon fodder from vassal states. They are using various weapons for large-scale massacres. They pour $3 million a day into the pockets of the puppet sellout politicians and generals in the Saigon rat hole.

	Yet, they are suffering failures and setbacks every moment, approaching despair. The brave and unyielding Vietnamese people are defending every inch of their land and achieving one victory after another. They are defeating the invaders from cities and temples, from forests and hills, from marshes, rice fields, and villages, making every house and every Vietnamese person an insurmountable barrier in the struggle for national salvation.

	Meanwhile, on the domestic front in the United States, the good Americans who are different from the capitalist-imperialists are becoming increasingly impatient, difficult to control, and very disheartened. This unprecedented evil aggression against a peaceful region thousands of miles away from American shores is draining their resources. The burden of a prolonged war is becoming heavier, and the dream of seizing Vietnam as an anti-China war base is melting away like a snowball in the sun. Mass rallies and protests against the Johnson administration, held by tens of thousands of workers, students, intellectuals, veterans, men and women, blacks and whites, express the true feelings of the American people across the vast land—from New York City in the East to Los Angeles on the West Coast.

	Not only are imperialism and neo-colonialism enemies of the world's peace-loving people, but so is revisionism. Revisionism is the modern Judas, betraying his brother for thirty pieces of silver. Imperialism and revisionism are the evil, two-faced gatekeepers of ancient mythology. But today, they are just the two sides of the same filthy coin. Look at this coin (holding up the coin), one side is imperialism; the other side is revisionism. The ugly two sides of the same filthy coin: it is deceitful like that.

	The imperialists and revisionists have divided the world into two hostile camps. On one side are the forces of war, destruction, and death, and on the other side are the forces of peace, progress, and the struggle for a better life for all humanity. We do not need to be prophets to predict the outcome of this great struggle. The Vietnamese people will win, the Asian and African peoples will surely win, and the imperialists, neo-colonialists, and modern revisionists will be buried in the graves they have dug with their own crimes and stupidity. This is inevitable, just as dawn follows night.

	China is the vanguard of the oppressed fighting against the oppressors. The newly emerging nations of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, which have long suffered from slavery and exploitation, will unite under the great and noble vanguard of the new China, the world revolution. They will unite around the incomparable leader and teacher, the unparalleled hero and guide of all revolutionaries in the world—our beloved Chairman Mao Zedong!

	Long live the heroic ten million people of great Shanghai!

	Long live China, its socialist government, and its 700 million noble people, as well as its ever-youthful hero, Chairman Mao Zedong!

	Long live the nationalists, progressives, and revolutionaries of all countries, especially the patriotic writers who pledge to use their pens and guns to eliminate their common enemy, American imperialism! Long live! Long live! Long live!

	Thank you all, goodbye!

    菲律宾代表团团长埃尔南德斯的讲话
    庄严雄伟的上海市和英勇的一千万人民！请允许我这个来自菲律宾的微不足道的代表，中国的一位忠实的老朋友，向你致敬，并向你们转达英雄的菲律宾人民的革命的问候和良好的祝愿。
    全世界早就记得你的光荣历史。你是伟大的中国共产党的神圣的诞生地，中国共产党在一九二一年七月一日在幸福的光辉中诞生了。最早的社会主义起义是在你的怀抱中酝酿形成的，这个伟大城市的英勇儿女是最先向资本主义和帝国主义纸老虎挑战的自由战士。
    代表五十三个国家和地区的亚非作家们一个月以前曾在北京一次具有特殊意义的会议上聚集一堂。那次会议通过的两个决议是最重要的。第一个是全力支持越南人民反对美帝国主义的斗争，直到他们取得彻底解放，并消灭这个当代的头号恶魔为止。其次，就是建立一个非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲的一切被压迫和爱好和平的人民的巩固的统一战线，并且向帝国主义、新殖民主义和它们的走狗——被奴役国家当地的暴君——发动一次毁灭性的进军。
    亚非作家们即将回国，在各自的国内战线上执行这些决议。这条道路不是平坦轻松的，不同于我们浩浩荡荡从北京开始的旅行所经过的那些林荫大道，象我们从北京到武汉、从武汉到延安、从延安到西安、从西安到洛阳、从洛阳到南京和无锡、从无锡到苏州和杭州、从杭州来到了世界闻名的上海市，在这里欢迎我们的有成千上万张微笑的面孔和热烈的掌声，还有明亮的灯光、音乐、旗帜和鲜花。在我们回国的遥远的路途上，将充满着危险和牺牲。因为我们这些拿笔的战士是真理和自由的革命先驱。也许不少人会在路上倒下来，成为谋杀和监禁的对象。所幸的是，革命的作家都认识到一个人只能死一次，但是英雄和烈士们将永远活在他们的人民和世世代代的人民的心灵之中。
    我本人在国内曾被扼制自由的反动敌人一度监禁达六年之久。在最高法院宣布释放我的那天，监狱长陪我到大门口，好心地向我告别说：“你不要再回到这个监狱里来了。”我马上就回答说：“我可不能担保。”因为我从心底里知道，铁窗内残酷的六年并没有折磨掉我的革命精神。因此肯定他们会阴谋再度监禁我，或者把我杀掉。这由他们去操心好了。只有那些不怕死的人才适于在自由和尊严中生活。
    美帝国主义者象墨西哥斗牛场上受伤的公牛一样，正在疯狂地横冲直撞。他们在残忍地把全世界拖入一场全面的战争。约翰逊、腊斯克和麦克纳马拉这疯狂的三寡头，变得越来越嗜血成性。他们对在人为制造的十七度线以南地区继续屠杀包括手无寸铁的妇女儿童在内的无辜居民，感到还不满足。他们已经把战争升级到越南民主共和国的心脏和躯体——河内和海防。这些狂人为他们可以和地狱相比的罪行的成绩而得意洋洋。他们对非洲和亚洲的被压迫人民以及被他们挂上“香蕉共和国”标志的某些拉丁美洲国家强制实行专横的统治，并肆无忌惮地进行剥削。他们无耻地蹂躏中国的合法省分台湾，并且用贩卖战争的军事基地和海军基地恶毒地把中国包围起来。所有这些反对世界人民的可鄙的国际强盗行径都必须遭到谴责，驳斥和最后的惩罚。
    只要美帝国主义者一天霸占着台湾，并且雇佣叛徒蒋介石作为台湾的狱卒，世界就一天不会忘记华尔街的血腥的死亡贩子和五角大楼的小希特勒们是当代历史上最卑鄙可耻的匪徒。
    在朝鲜的痛苦教训并没有刻进这些帝国主义者的愚蠢的头脑。今天，三千一百万不屈的越南人民正在给他们另一次教训。美国强盗们正在残酷地扫荡和平农民的田地和家园。他们运进了三十万武装到牙齿的军队，还从仆从国家运去了更多的炮灰。他们使用各种武器进行大规模的屠杀。他们每天要向西贡这个老鼠洞和他们的工具——雇佣的卖国政客将军们的口袋里倾注三百万美元。
    然而，他们每时每刻都在遭到失败、挫折，接近于绝望。英勇不屈的越南人民正在保卫他们的每一寸土地并且取得一个又一个的胜利。他们从城市和寺庙，从丛林和山岗，从沼泽地、稻田和村庄打垮了侵略者，这样每一所房屋、每一个越南人都是救国斗争中不可逾越的壁垒。
    与此同时，在美国的国内战线上，那些不同于资本家—帝国主义者的善良的美国人，正迅速地变得很不耐烦，难于驾驭，和十分沮丧。这场对一个远离美国国境万哩以外的和平地区所进行的史无前例的罪恶侵略正在吸干他们的资源的生命力。一场旷日持久的战争的负担变得越来越沉重，而攫取越南，把它作为一个反华的战争基地的幻想正象一个雪球一样在阳光中迅速融化。由成千上万的工人、学生、知识分子、退伍军人、男人和女人、黑人和白人所举行的谴责约翰逊政权的群众集会和抗议示威，表达出了美国的广大国土上——从东部的纽约市到西海岸的洛杉矶——的美国人民的真实感情。
    不仅帝国主义和新殖民主义是世界爱好和平的人民的敌人，修正主义也是世界爱好和平的人民的敌人，修正主义是现代的犹大，以三十元银币出卖了他的弟兄。帝国主义和修正主义是古代神话中邪恶的、阴阳两面的守门神。但是今天他们只不过是同一个肮脏铜钱的两面而已。请看这个铜钱（拿着铜钱），这一面是帝国主义；另一面是修正主义。同一个肮脏铜钱的丑恶的两面：它就是这样欺人的。
    帝国主义者和修正主义者已经把世界分裂成两个敌对的阵营。一方面是战争、破坏和死亡的势力，一方面是和平、进步和争取全人类美好生活的力量。我们不需要作预言家，就可以预先说出这场巨大的斗争的最后结果。越南人民将会胜利、亚非人民必会胜利，帝国主义者、新殖民主义者和现代修正主义者将被埋葬在用他们自己的罪恶和愚蠢挖掘的坟墓中，这是必然的，正象黑夜后面必然是清晨一样。
    中国是被压迫者反抗压迫者的先锋。长期遭受奴役与剥削的非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲的新兴国家将团结在新中国这个世界革命的伟大而崇高的先锋，将团结在无可比拟的领袖和导师的周围，这位领袖和导师也就是世界上所有革命者的无与伦比的英雄和指路人——我们敬爱的毛泽东主席！
    伟大的上海市的一千万英勇人民万岁！
    中国，它的社会主义政府和七亿高尚的人民以及她的永葆青春的英雄，毛泽东主席万岁！
    各国的民族主义者，进步人士和革命者，特别是保证用笔和枪来消灭他们的共同敌人美帝国主义的爱国作家万岁！万岁！万岁！
    谢谢大家，再见了！
