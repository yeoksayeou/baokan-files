Title: One Hand Cannot Cover the Eyes of the World

After China exposed the conspiracy of the Soviet and American collusion in Vietnam to the people of the world, the Soviet revisionist leadership found themselves in a very awkward position. They are unwilling to give up, but they are also afraid of being too obvious. Under these circumstances, the Soviet *Pravda* on July 28 used the bold headline "Sino-American Dialogue" to excerpt a conversation between the U.S. Ambassador to Warsaw and an American magazine, stating that the Sino-American talks in Warsaw "made it possible to discuss a series of issues faced by the two countries, especially those in Southeast Asia and the world," and that "in view of the Vietnam issue," "these talks are beneficial for a series of reasons," and "both sides obviously want these talks to continue."

Everyone can see the intention behind this report by *Pravda*. The Soviet revisionist leadership merely wants to say: China accuses us of colluding with the United States, but aren't you also "dialoguing" with the United States? Since China's talks with the United States in Warsaw are acceptable, why is it a crime for me to promote peace talks in Vietnam?

Gentlemen in Moscow, this traitorous logic will not exonerate you in the slightest.

Our stance on negotiations has always been consistent and adheres to the principles of Marxism-Leninism, which is to engage in a struggle of equals. As early as 1945, Chairman Mao pointed out: "'Struggle of equals,' depends on the situation. Sometimes not talking is a struggle of equals; sometimes talking is also a struggle of equals." This is the attitude of Marxists towards negotiations.

The Sino-American ambassador-level talks have dragged on for more than a decade, and this is no longer news. Because China takes a firm Marxist-Leninist stance and will never trade principles, the United States has gained nothing from the Sino-American talks. As in other situations, here, China firmly condemns the United States' bloody aggression against Vietnam, firmly condemns all the peace talk tricks the United States plays in the Vietnam issue, and firmly supports the Vietnamese people's sacred struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. *Pravda*'s attempt to imply that China is making some political dealings with the United States over the Vietnam issue will only make people laugh.

While attacking China with insinuations, the Soviet revisionist leadership has recently repeatedly shown a disinterest in "peace talks," which is nothing but a cover-up. Who said that the bombing of Hanoi by the United States does not affect the conclusion of the Soviet-American disarmament agreement? Who reacted so coldly to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's fighting proclamation "To All Fellow Countrymen"? Who just received the American "peace talk" broker Mrs. Gandhi and Wilson in Moscow? Who had "warm" talks with U Thant on the "three-point plan" for peace in Vietnam? Who sent the foreign minister to Tokyo to discuss the Vietnam issue with the Sato government? One hand cannot cover the eyes of the world. How will the Soviet revisionist leadership explain these series of facts?

Recently, the *People's Army Newspaper* of Vietnam severely criticized various fallacies that serve American imperialism and demand that the Vietnamese people accept "peace talks." The *People's Army Newspaper* pointed out: To raise the issue of negotiating with the United States and to demand that the people of South Vietnam accept a ceasefire with the United States while the United States stubbornly refuses all the sacred basic national rights of the Vietnamese people, intensifies its aggression against Vietnam, and strongly uses military pressure, is to encourage the American aggressors to be greedy. The just stance of the Vietnamese people has won the support of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world. However, the Soviet revisionist leadership is attempting to trade the blood of the Vietnamese people with American imperialism to realize their dream of "Sino-Soviet cooperation to rule the world." What kind of hearts do the nobles of the Kremlin have?

The Soviet Union has a proverb: "On paper, anything can be written." The editors of *Pravda* can scribble whatever they want on paper, but even if you publish another hundred articles with ulterior motives about China, you cannot cover up the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist leadership in selling out the fundamental interests of the Vietnamese people and acting as a henchman for American imperialism.

    一手难掩天下人耳目
    本报评论员
    中国在全世界人民面前揭露了苏美串通在越南推行“以炸迫和”的阴谋之后，苏联修正主义领导集团处于一种十分尴尬的地位。他们决不甘心罢手不干，但又怕做得过于露骨。在这种情况下，苏联《真理报》七月二十八日用《中美对话》的黑体大字标题，摘登了美国驻华沙大使同美国一家杂志的谈话，说什么中美华沙会谈“使得能够讨论（中美）两国所碰到的一系列问题，特别是东南亚以及全世界的问题”，而且“鉴于越南问题”，“这些会谈由于一系列原因是有益的”，“双方显然都想使这些会谈继续下去”。
    人们一看就懂得，《真理报》的这一段报道用意何在。苏联修正主义领导集团无非想说：中国揭露我同美国勾结，可是，你们不是也在同美国“对话”吗？既然中国在华沙同美国谈判是可以的，为什么我促成越南和谈就有罪了呢？
    莫斯科的先生们，这种叛徒的逻辑，是一丝一毫也不可能为你们开脱罪责的。
    我们在谈判问题上的立场是始终一贯的，是坚持马克思列宁主义的原则的，这就是必须进行针锋相对的斗争。早在一九四五年，毛主席就曾指出：“‘针锋相对’，要看形势。有时候不去谈，是针锋相对；有时候去谈，也是针锋相对。”这就是马克思主义者对待谈判的态度。
    中美大使级的会谈，拖拖拉拉已达十多年，这早已不是什么新闻。由于中国采取马克思列宁主义的坚定立场，绝不拿原则作交易，美国从中美会谈中没有捞到任何东西。象在其他场合一样，在这里，中国坚决谴责美国对越南的血腥侵略罪行，坚决谴责美国在越南问题上所玩弄的一切和谈骗局，坚决支持越南人民抗美救国的神圣斗争。《真理报》企图暗示中国在同美国就越南问题进行某种政治交易，只会使人笑掉牙齿。
    苏联修正主义领导集团在对中国进行含沙射影攻击的同时，最近一再摆出一副对“和谈”不感兴趣的姿态，不过是“此地无银三百两”的表白。是谁说了美国轰炸河内并不影响苏美达成裁军协议的话？是谁对胡志明主席《告全国同胞书》的战斗文告反应如此冷淡？是谁刚刚在莫斯科接待了美国
  “和谈”掮客甘地夫人和威尔逊？是谁同吴丹就越南和谈的“三点计划”作了“热烈的”会谈？是谁的外交部长跑到东京同佐藤政府就越南问题谈个不休？一手难掩天下人耳目。对于这一系列的事实，苏联修正主义领导集团该作如何解释？
    越南《人民军队报》最近痛斥为美帝国主义效劳、要求越南人民接受“和谈”的各种谬论。《人民军队报》指出：提出同美国谈判的问题，要求越南南方人民在美国一味顽固地拒绝越南人民的一切神圣的基本民族权利，加强对越南的侵略战争和极力使用军事压力的时候同美国“停火”，这是鼓励美国侵略者得寸进尺。越南人民的这一正义立场，得到中国人民和全世界革命人民的支持。可是，苏联修正主义领导集团，却妄图用越南人民的鲜血同美帝国主义作买卖，以实现他们的“美苏合作主宰世界”的迷梦。克里姆林宫的权贵们，你们长的是一副什么心肝？！
    苏联有句谚语：“纸上是什么东西都能写的。”《真理报》的编辑可以随心所欲地在纸上涂抹，但是，即使你们再登上一百篇有关中国的别有用心的报道，也掩盖不了苏联修正主义领导集团出卖越南人民根本利益、充当美帝国主义帮凶的叛徒面目。
