Chairman Mao, we will forever be your red guards!
Chairman Mao, you are our supreme commander!
Chairman Mao, you are our great helmsman!
Chairman Mao, we will forever follow you through storms and waves!
Chairman Mao, we will forever be your red guards!

This was the common resolve expressed by thousands and millions of revolutionary youngsters to Chairman Mao at a rally in Shanghai celebrating the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Listen! A seventeen-year-old revolutionary youngster, a female student named Lu Fengying from the Sixth Middle School in Zhabei, spoke with a ringing voice from the rostrum: "To sail the seas, one needs a helmsman! Chairman Mao, you are the greatest helmsman on the course of the Chinese and world revolution! We will forever, forever follow you in making revolution through storms and waves!"

As she spoke, she was so moved that tears welled up in her eyes. At this moment, how could she not shed tears! It was Chairman Mao who led the Chinese people to establish the proletarian state; it was Chairman Mao who led the Chinese people from victory to victory; it was Chairman Mao's teachings that made her understand the principles of revolution; it was the invincible Mao Zedong Thought that gave her boundless wisdom and courage. She broke through numerous obstacles and persisted in studying Chairman Mao's works. She said: "We must carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end! Let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought be passed down from generation to generation!"

Look! Another revolutionary youngster, a twenty-one-year-old salesgirl named Dai Fuying from the small commodities wholesale department of the Shanghai General Department Store, was marching forward with a firm step, holding high a portrait of Chairman Mao. This young woman was a fearless "little tiger" in opposing the bourgeois "peaceful evolution." A few years ago, after graduating from junior high school and starting work, bourgeois elements repeatedly tried to corrupt her with decadent ideas of "eating well, dressing well, and playing well," using capitalist "business tactics" to make her "peacefully evolve." Because she insisted on applying Chairman Mao's works in her life, she saw through the enemy's tricks and persistently struggled against the bourgeois elements for several years. In the struggle, she became a revolutionary youngster with courage and wisdom. A few days ago, the revolutionary masses of the wholesale department elected her as the leader of the cultural revolution preparatory group. Today, she sang "To sail the seas, one needs a helmsman" loudly and repeatedly, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" a hundred times.

In the marching column of revolutionary teachers and students of the First Medical College of Shanghai, a twenty-two-year-old daughter of a revolutionary martyr, Li Yanyun, was walking at the head of the column today, wearing her parents' old military uniform.

When she was still in her mother's womb, her father fought a bloody battle against the reactionaries in the Jiaodong area. Though seriously wounded, he insisted on fighting to the end. Before his martyrdom, her father left his last instructions to her mother: "You must make sure the child remembers: forever follow the Party, follow Chairman Mao to make revolution, and do not leave the battlefield until all the wolves are exterminated!"

For many years, Li Yanyun has remembered her father's last words, persisted in studying Chairman Mao's works, and vowed to follow Chairman Mao in making revolution all her life. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, she launched fierce attacks on bourgeois rightists, bourgeois ideology, old customs, and old habits. She said: I vow to be a loyal red guard of the supreme commander Chairman Mao! I will thoroughly smash and defeat all ghosts and monsters!

### 毛主席，我们永远做您的红色小兵

　　毛主席，我们永远做您的红色小兵
    毛主席，您是我们的最高统帅！
    毛主席，您是我们的伟大舵手！
    毛主席，我们永远跟着您在大风大浪中前进！
    毛主席，我们永远做您的红色小兵！
    这是在上海百万革命群众庆祝无产阶级文化大革命的集会上，千千万万革命小将向毛主席表示的共同决心。
    听！十七岁的革命小将、闸北第六中学女学生陆凤英，在大会主席台上发出了铿锵的声音：大海航行靠舵手！毛主席啊，您是中国革命和世界革命航道上最伟大的舵手！我们永远永远跟着您在大风大浪里闹革命！
    说着说着，她激动得热泪夺眶而出。此时此刻，怎能不教她淌出热泪来！是毛主席领导中国人民创立了我国无产阶级的江山；是毛主席领导中国人民，从胜利走向胜利；是毛主席的教导，使她懂得了革命的道理；是战无不胜的毛泽东思想，使她获得无穷的智慧和勇气。她冲破重重阻挠，坚持学习毛主席著作。她说：“我们一定要把文化大革命进行到底！让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗世世代代传下去！”
    看！又一个革命小将，上海市百货公司小商品批发部二十一岁的营业员戴福英，高擎毛主席画像，踏着坚定的步伐走来了。这位女青年，是反对资产阶级“和平演变”的无所畏惧的“小老虎”。几年前，她初中毕业参加工作后，资产阶级分子曾一再用“吃受用，穿威风，玩轻松”的一套腐朽思想，用资本主义的“生意经”来腐蚀她，妄图使她“和平演变”。由于坚持活学活用毛主席著作，她心明眼亮，一下就识破了敌人的阴谋诡计，坚持不懈地向资产阶级分子斗争了好几年。在斗争中，她锻炼成了一个有魄力、有智慧的革命小将。前两天，批发部的革命群众推选她担任文化革命筹备小组的组长。今天，她一遍又一遍放声高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，十次百次地高呼“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    在上海第一医学院革命师生的游行队伍里，二十二岁的革命烈士女儿李艳云，今天穿着亲人的旧军装，走在队伍的前列。
    当她还在母亲腹中的时候，她父亲在胶东地区，同反动派进行了浴血战斗。他身负重伤，仍然坚持打到底。在临牺牲前，爸爸给妈妈留下了最后的嘱咐：
  “一定要让孩子记住：永远跟着党、跟着毛主席闹革命，不打尽豺狼，决不下战场！……”
    多年来，李艳云牢记父亲的遗言，坚持学习毛主席著作，立志跟毛主席干一辈子革命。在文化大革命中，她向资产阶级右派分子，向资产阶级意识形态，旧风俗、旧习惯势力，猛烈开火。她说：我要誓作忠诚于最高统帅毛主席的一名红色小兵！把一切牛鬼蛇神彻底打倒，彻底打垮！
