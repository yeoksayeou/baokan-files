The 1966 Summer Physics Discussion Meeting of the Beijing Science Discussion Meeting is currently being held. More than 140 scientists from over 30 countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania have gathered in Beijing to exchange scientific research experiences and jointly explore the path to developing and flourishing physics on the four continents.

Foreign friends participating in the physics discussion meeting love Chairman Mao's works. The picture shows Amadou Jallo, a scientist from Sierra Leone (second from the right), purchasing "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" from the hotel bookstore and shaking hands with the salesperson to express his thanks.

Wei Ruqun, the leader of the Vietnamese scientific delegation, delivers a speech at the academic meeting of the physics teaching group.

Japanese scientist Shosuke Ogawa delivers an academic report titled "New Developments in Basic Particle Theory – Sakata Model" at the plenary meeting. He comprehensively summarizes the contributions made by Japanese scientific workers in the field of basic particle theory over the past decade.

At the academic meeting of the physics teaching group, Mexican, Syrian, and Sierra Leonean scientists discuss academic issues.

Australian and Syrian scientists engage in friendly discussions on topics of mutual interest.

Chinese expert in electric light sources, Cai Ziquan, who came from a worker background, delivers an academic report titled "Making Lamps for the Revolution" at the plenary meeting. Cai Ziquan and his comrades, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, insist on the path of self-reliance. In just three to four years, they completed the research on new types of electric light sources, a process that took Western capitalist countries twenty to thirty years. They have broken through the blockade imposed by imperialism and modern revisionism.

Wang Rong, representing the Beijing Basic Particle Theory Group, delivers an academic report titled "Researching Basic Particle Theory Under the Guidance of Mao Zedong Thought" at the plenary meeting. This report explains how Chinese physicists, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have creatively proposed the "quark model" theory through practice, advancing the theoretical research on the internal structure of basic particles by a significant step.

Scientists from various countries visit the electric light source exhibition hall organized by the Chinese scientific delegation with great interest. In the picture, Cai Ziquan, a Chinese expert in electric light sources who came from a worker background, introduces to the visiting foreign scientists the process of how he and his comrades actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works to make lamps for the revolution.

The "water hammer pump model" exhibited in the physics demonstration equipment exhibition hall organized by the Chinese scientific delegation attracts scientists from Sudan, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and other countries. This demonstration equipment was designed and made by Chinese teachers and students based on the actual water hammer pump during production labor. It can help students understand some principles of fluid mechanics.

    为反帝反殖和发展民族科学文化而斗争
    ——参加物理讨论会的四大洲科学家在北京
    北京科学讨论会一九六六年暑期物理讨论会正在举行。来自亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和大洋洲三十多个国家的一百四十多位科学家聚集北京，互相交流科学研究经验，共同探讨发展和繁荣四大洲物理学的道路。
    参加物理讨论会的外国朋友热爱毛主席著作。图为塞拉勒窝内科学家阿马杜·贾洛（右一），从宾馆售书处购买《毛泽东选集》后，同售货员握手致谢。
    越南科学家代表团团长魏如昆嵩在物理教学组学术会议上发言。
    日本科学家小川修三在全体会议上作题为《基本粒子理论的新发展——坂田模型》的学术报告。他比较全面地总结了近十年来日本科学工作者在基本粒子理论方面作出的贡献。
    在物理教学组学术会议上，墨西哥科学家和叙利亚、塞拉勒窝内科学家讨论学术问题。
    澳大利亚科学家和叙利亚科学家就共同感兴趣的问题进行友好讨论。
    我国工人出身的电光源专家蔡祖泉在全体会议上作《为革命造灯》的学术报告。蔡祖泉和他的战友们，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持走自力更生的道路，只用三、四年时间，就走完了西方资本主义国家在研究新型电光源方面花了二、三十年才走完的路程，打破了帝国主义和现代修正主义对我们的封锁。
    中国物理学工作者汪容代表北京基本粒子理论组，在全体会议上作题为《在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下研究基本粒子理论》的学术报告。这篇报告说明，中国物理学工作者以毛泽东思想为武器，经过实践，创造性地提出了反映基本粒子内部结构的“层子模型”理论，把基本粒子内部结构的理论研究向前推进了一大步。
    各国科学家怀着极大的兴趣，参观中国科学家代表团举办的电光源陈列室。这是我国工人出身的电光源专家蔡祖泉向前来参观的外国科学家们介绍他和他的战友们活学活用毛主席著作，为革命造灯的过程。
    在中国科学家代表团举办的物理演示教具陈列室展出的“水锤泵模型”，吸引了苏丹、锡兰、巴基斯坦等国科学家。这个演示教具是我国师生在生产劳动中根据实际的水锤泵设计制作的，它可以帮助学生理解流体力学的一些原理。
