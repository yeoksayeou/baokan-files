Tear Apart Sun Yefang's Black Flag of "Profit as the Commander"

Factory Director of the Daqing-style Enterprise 3517 Factory, Liu Jiyong

Sun Yefang vigorously promotes "profit as the commander," "money as the commander," asserting that "profit should be the central indicator of the plan" and relentlessly advocates for using profit indicators to "drive enterprise management." He emphasizes that "the amount of profit reflects the level of technology and the quality of management of an enterprise in the most comprehensive way," and so on. This is a thorough and complete revisionist product that must be thoroughly criticized.

Take our factory as an example. We follow Chairman Mao's teachings that "politics is the commander, the soul," and "political work is the lifeline of all economic work." We emphasize putting politics in command, adhering to running the enterprise according to Mao Zedong Thought, fully mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers, greatly enhancing the sense of responsibility of the broad masses of workers to produce for the revolution and serve the army, and effectively promoting the development of production and changing the face of the enterprise.

Workers regard the quality of the products as the main measure of whether they are wholeheartedly serving the army and whether they have deep class feelings for the soldiers. Whether it is cadres or workers, as long as they find any problems with the product quality, even the slightest blemish, they will not let it go. If a raincoat is missing three eyelets, or a sleeve is one centimeter short, they will not hesitate to search through thousands of products to find it and fix it. Workers say: "What we find is not just a one-centimeter or three-eyelet error, but more importantly, we find the sense of responsibility to wholeheartedly serve the army and the good style of strictness and meticulousness." Over the years, workers, despite hardships, have gone to the army more than eighty times to solicit soldiers' opinions on product quality, understand the use of products under various complex conditions, and collect a large amount of firsthand materials to continuously improve product design and enhance product quality. For example, rubber shoes used to last eighty days, now they can last one hundred and sixty days; raincoats used to last two and a half years, now they can last five years. We ask Sun Yefang: Can the workers' spirit of wholeheartedly serving the army and highly valuing product quality be brought out by "profit" and "money"? No, absolutely not! Implementing "profit as the commander" and "money as the commander" can only foster the capitalist business mentality of blindly pursuing profits; only by relying on political command and relying on Mao Zedong Thought as the commander can we truly improve product quality.

Workers always respond promptly to urgent tasks. Every time an urgent task comes down, whether it is day or night, workers always immediately give their all and enter the battle. Machine repair workers, to rush the production of high-heeled thick-soled rubber shoes molds, worked selflessly and completed three months' work in thirty-seven days. For especially urgent tasks, even the workers' families voluntarily join the production battle. With a high level of class consciousness and boundless enthusiasm, since 1961, our factory has, while completing normal tasks, completed and completed ahead of schedule one hundred and twenty-seven urgent tasks. We ask Sun Yefang: Can the workers' high level of class consciousness and boundless enthusiasm be brought out by "profit" and "money"? No, absolutely not! Only by relying on political command and relying on Mao Zedong Thought as the commander, can the broad masses of workers establish class viewpoints, preparedness thinking, patriotism, and internationalism, and achieve this.

Workers link the great development of technological innovation and technological revolution with the struggle against imperialism and revisionism, strive for self-reliance, and work hard. Over the years, through the efforts of the workers, our factory has successively designed and installed twenty-three assembly lines, self-manufactured eighty-seven types and four hundred and one non-standard equipment, reformed thirty-two types and one hundred and twenty old equipment, greatly changing the backward face of production technology. In the manufacture of shoe molds, revisionism blocks us and does not provide technical data. Workers decide to do it themselves, carry forward the spirit of hard work and practical work, and without precision casting equipment, use hammers to hit; without vertical milling machines, make them themselves, and finally made the rubber shoe mold forming machine. In the manufacturing process, a "conservative" poured cold water on the workers, saying that the steel quality was too hard and the precision was too high, and they could not do it. The workers replied: "The steel quality is hard, but it is not as hard as the spirit of the proletarian backbone; the precision is high, but it is not as high as the wisdom of workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought." Through the creative labor of the workers, so far, three assembly lines for machine production of rubber shoes have been installed. We ask Sun Yefang: Can the workers' spirit of self-reliance and striving for progress be brought out by "profit" and "money"? No, absolutely not! Only by relying on political command and relying on Mao Zedong Thought as the commander, can technology and productive forces develop at an unprecedented high speed.

Workers highly cherish state property, regard thrift as a matter of preventing and opposing revisionism and preserving the proletarian nature, and in production, they carefully calculate and save every gram of rubber, every inch of cloth, every drop of oil, and every nail and piece of wood, without sparing effort and hard work. From 1961 to 1965, in production, a total of one hundred and seventy-six tons of rubber and thirty-nine million square meters of cotton cloth were saved. In 1965, the materials department's waste processing group created more than thirty-seven thousand yuan of wealth in the aspect of repairing old and using waste. They say: "We are not afraid of waste products, but we are afraid of waste thoughts," "As long as there is a red heart, waste products turn into gold." We ask Sun Yefang: Can the workers' spirit of thrift and hard work be brought out by "profit" and "money"? No, absolutely not! Only by relying on political command and relying on Mao Zedong Thought as the commander, can the broad masses of workers have the enthusiasm to accelerate socialist construction and support the world people's revolution, and have this revolutionary spirit of thrift.

Sun Yefang uses every means to peddle his revisionist black goods of "profit as the commander" and "money as the commander," intending to lead our socialist enterprises onto the capitalist path. If his plot succeeds, enterprises will pursue profits, emphasizing technology first, business first, and eventually cancel proletarian politics, which is essentially canceling the Party's leadership, canceling the dictatorship of the proletariat, and canceling socialism; they will not care about the needs of the state and the people, determining the production varieties with profits, which will inevitably disrupt the state's unified plan and cause chaos in the entire national economy; they will use any means, cut corners, harm others for personal gain, seek profit at all costs, use less to cover more, use bad to pass off as good, which will inevitably cause great losses to the state and consumers and result in a huge waste of social material wealth. From this, it can be seen that Sun Yefang's political purpose is to turn socialist enterprises into revisionist enterprises and change the color of our Party and state. Tell you, Sun Yefang, this is absolutely impossible, we firmly do not agree! We must tear your "profit as the commander" black flag to shreds!

### 撕碎孙冶方“利润挂帅”的黑旗

　　撕碎孙冶方“利润挂帅”的黑旗
　　大庆式企业三五一七工厂厂长　刘继永
    孙冶方竭力地宣扬“利润挂帅”、“钞票挂帅”，说什么“以利润作为计划中心指标”，拚命地鼓吹用利润指标来“推动企业管理”，强调
  “利润的多少是反映企业技术水平和经营管理好坏的最综合指标”，等等。这是彻头彻尾的修正主义货色，必须彻底批判。
    就拿我们工厂的情况来说吧，我们遵照毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂，“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，强调突出政治，坚持按毛泽东思想办企业，充分地调动了广大职工的积极性和创造性，大大地提高了广大职工为革命生产、为部队服务的主人翁责任感，有力地促进了生产的发展，改变了企业的面貌。
    职工们把产品质量的好坏，作为衡量自己是否全心全意为部队服务、对战士有无深厚的阶级感情的主要尺度。不论干部、工人，只要发现产品质量有问题，那怕是微小的瑕疵，也不放过。一件雨衣只差三个针眼，一只袖子只差一厘米，也不惜翻箱倒库，从成千上万件产品中找出来重新修好。工人们说：“我们找回来的不只是一厘米、三针眼的差错，更重要的是找回来了全心全意为部队服务的责任心，和严字当头，一丝不苟的好作风。”几年来，职工们不辞千辛万苦，先后八十多次到部队征求战士对产品质量的意见，了解产品在各种复杂条件下的使用情况，搜集了大量的第一手资料，不断改进产品设计，提高产品质量。例如，胶鞋过去穿八十天，现在可以穿一百六十天；雨衣过去穿二年半，现在可以穿五年。我们要质问孙冶方：工人这种全心全意为部队服务、高度重视产品质量的思想，难道是什么“利润”、“钞票”能够带出来的吗？不能，绝对不能！实行“利润挂帅”、“钞票挂帅”，只能助长盲目地追求利润的资本主义经营思想；只有依靠政治挂帅，依靠毛泽东思想挂帅，才能真正地搞好产品质量。
    职工们对待紧急任务，总是闻风而动。每次紧急任务一下来，不管是白天还是黑夜，职工们总是立即全力以赴，投入战斗。机修工人为了赶制高腰厚底胶鞋的模具，忘我地劳动，用三十七天就完成了三个月的工作量。特别紧急的任务，连职工家属都自觉地投入生产战斗。凭着高度的阶级觉悟和冲天干劲，从一九六一年以来，我们工厂在完成正常任务的同时，完成和提前完成了一百二十七次紧急任务。我们要质问孙冶方：工人这种高度的阶级觉悟和冲天干劲，难道是“利润”、“钞票”能够带出来的吗？不能，绝对不能！只有依靠政治挂帅，依靠毛泽东思想挂帅，广大职工群众树立了阶级观点、战备思想、爱国主义和国际主义思想，才能做到。
    职工们把大搞技术革新、技术革命同反帝反修斗争联系起来，自力更生，奋发图强。几年来，通过职工们的努力，我们工厂先后设计安装了二十三条流水作业线，自制了八十七种、四百零一台非标准设备，改革了三十二种、一百二十台老设备，大大地改变了生产技术上的落后面貌。在鞋模制造上，修正主义卡我们，不给技术资料。职工们决心自己动手，发扬苦干实干的精神，没有精密铸造设备，就用锤来打；没有立式铣床，就自己造，终于制成了胶鞋压模成型机。在制作过程中，有一个“保守派”给工人泼冷水，说什么钢质太硬，精密度太高，你们搞不了。工人回答说：“钢质再硬，硬不过无产阶级硬骨头精神；精密度再高，高不过用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人智慧。”经过工人创造性的劳动，到现在为止，已经安装了三条用机器生产胶鞋的流水作业线。我们要质问孙冶方：工人们的这种自力更生，奋发图强的革命精神，难道是“利润”、“钞票”能够带出来的吗？不能，绝对不能！只有依靠政治挂帅，依靠毛泽东思想挂帅，才能促进技术和生产力以史无前例的高速度发展。
    职工们高度珍惜国家财产，把厉行节约，看成是防修反修、永葆无产阶级本色的问题，在生产上精打细算，为了节约一克胶、一寸布、一滴油、一钉一木，不惜耗费心血，付出辛勤劳动。一九六一年到一九六五年，在生产上共节约橡胶一百七十六吨，棉布三十九万平方米。一九六五年，器材科废品加工组，在修旧利废方面就创造了三万七千多元财富。他们说：“不怕废品废，就怕思想废”，“只要有红心，废品变成金”。我们要质问孙冶方：工人们这种勤俭节约、艰苦奋斗的精神，难道是“利润”、“钞票”能够带动起来的吗？不能，绝对不能！只有依靠政治挂帅，依靠毛泽东思想挂帅，使广大职工具有加速社会主义建设、支援世界人民革命的满腔热情，才能有这种勤俭节约的革命精神。
    孙冶方千方百计地推销他的“利润挂帅”、“钞票挂帅”的修正主义黑货，是想把我们社会主义企业引上资本主义的邪路。如果他的阴谋得逞，企业为了追求利润，就会强调技术第一，业务第一，结果必然取消无产阶级政治，实质上就是取消党的领导，取消无产阶级专政，取消社会主义；就会不顾国家和人民的需要，以利润来确定生产的品种，结果必然打乱国家统一计划，使整个国民经济发生混乱；就会不择手段，偷工减料，损人利己，唯利是图，以少顶多，以坏充好，结果必然给国家和消费者带来极大损失，造成社会物质财富的巨大浪费。由此可见，孙冶方的政治目的，就是要使社会主义企业变成修正主义企业，使我们的党和国家改变颜色。告诉你，孙冶方，这是万万办不到的，我们坚决不答应！我们一定要把你的“利润挂帅”黑旗撕得粉碎！
