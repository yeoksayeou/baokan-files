We have heard the Party Central Committee's decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and are overjoyed. After listening to the first broadcast, we couldn't help but spread the news everywhere.

This good news reached our dormitory, and many workers spontaneously gathered to discuss it. Everyone expressed strong support for the Party Central Committee's decision and spoke enthusiastically about their boundless love for the Party and Chairman Mao. At that time, our excitement was indescribable.

We all agreed that this decision is like a timely rain, serving as the "steering wheel" to guide the current Cultural Revolution. We automotive workers understand that a car cannot run without a steering wheel. The current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution also needs a "steering wheel." The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's decision is exactly the "steering wheel" that our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution urgently needs.

Dear Party Central Committee, great leader Chairman Mao, we will resolutely respond to your great call. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that touches people's souls, we will put "dare" first, dare to charge, dare to break through, dare to revolutionize, and dare to struggle. We will firmly carry out your instructions, strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and carry forward the fearless revolutionary spirit of the working class.

We will seize the revolution and promote production, produce more cars, produce cars quickly, and produce good cars, determined to fight a brilliant battle in production.

In the battle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely carry out the Central Committee's decision, thoroughly overthrow those in power who are taking the capitalist road, and criticize bourgeois "authorities." We will sweep away all monsters and demons, and will not stop until we achieve complete victory.

　　我们最需要这个“方向盘”
    我们听了党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定以后，高兴万分。听完第一次广播，就情不自禁地到处传送。
    这一喜讯传到了宿舍以后，许多工人便自动地围起来进行座谈，大家表示热烈拥护党中央这一决定，畅谈对党对毛主席的无比热爱。当时我们的激动心情是难于形容的。
    我们一致认为，这个决定是“及时雨”，是指导当前文化大革命的“方向盘”。我们汽车工人明白，汽车上没有方向盘是不能行驶的。当前无产阶级文化大革命运动，也要有个“方向盘”。党中央和毛主席的这个决定，就是我们无产阶级文化大革命迫切需要的“方向盘”。
    敬爱的党中央，伟大的领袖毛主席，我们最坚决地响应您的伟大号召，在这场触及人们灵魂的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，我们要“敢”字当头，敢冲，敢闯，敢革命，敢斗争，坚决执行您的指示，努力活学活用毛主席著作，发扬工人阶级大无畏的革命精神。
    我们要抓革命促生产，多出汽车，快出汽车，出好汽车，立志在生产上打个漂亮仗。
    在无产阶级文化大革命的战斗中，我们要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决执行中央的决定，彻底斗垮走资本主义道路的当权派和批判资产阶级“权威”，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，不获全胜，决不收兵。
