The Beijing Song and Dance Troupe's visit to the Soviet Union, which lasted over twenty days, was warmly welcomed by the Soviet people. Despite obstacles and restrictions from relevant Soviet authorities, the Soviet people enthusiastically expressed their boundless love for the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Comrade Mao Zedong, and requested the troupe to convey their respect to Chairman Mao.

From July 27 to August 20, the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe performed in Lugansk, Kadiyevka, Donetsk, Moscow, Leningrad, Petrozavodsk, and other cities in the Soviet Union.

The Soviet people enthusiastically praised the performances that sang the praises of the great leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong, and embodied Mao Zedong Thought.

When the curtain rose on the dance "Great Festival" and Chairman Mao's portrait appeared on stage, the audience immediately erupted in enthusiastic applause. Songs like "The Boat Needs a Helmsman" and "The Long March," which praised the great achievements of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army under Chairman Mao's leadership, deeply moved the Soviet audience. In Lugansk, after listening to "The Boat Needs a Helmsman," an audience member was so moved that they shed tears and raised their arms to shout, "Great! Great!" A theater worker, after watching the performance of the Long March suite, said, "Mao Zedong is truly great!" A worker from the Lugansk Mining Machinery Factory said after watching the performance, "Mao Zedong is our friend, we love Mao Zedong!" A female audience member in Leningrad excitedly said, "You have inherited the revolution. Mao Zedong is leading you. Mao Zedong is the most correct, he is the most steadfast in the struggle." During the performance in Petrozavodsk, someone in the audience shouted amidst enthusiastic applause, "Long live the great friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China! Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong!"

A 70-year-old veteran who had participated in many years of armed struggle in Moscow, after watching the dance "Female Militia on the Frontier," said, "Mao Zedong is correct. We should take up arms because imperialism still exists. The girls should be armed." Many audience members, after watching songs and dances that reflected the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, such as "Destroying 'Strategic Villages'" and "Ode to the Storm," repeatedly praised them. A female audience member in Leningrad expressed her strong support for Chairman Mao's assertion that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. She said, "Imperialism is a paper tiger, this is correct. Look, the Vietnamese people have been fighting for several years and have already achieved great victories. You are not afraid of imperialism, this is correct." She repeatedly expressed that this was not just her personal opinion, but represented the views of many people.

The performances of the troupe this time, which embodied Chairman Mao's policy of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, were warmly praised by the Soviet people. The troupe's printed program included Chairman Mao's quote: "Our literature and art are for the people, primarily for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and used by the workers, peasants, and soldiers." The audience enthusiastically agreed. They said, "In your performances, the images of workers, peasants, and soldiers are presented, which makes us very excited," these performances are "particularly thought-provoking," "very revolutionary," "reflect the people's fighting spirit," "this is a revolutionary performance."

The Chinese performers' singing of Soviet revolutionary songs such as "Hymn to Light," "Song of the Komsomol," and "Holy War" evoked memories of the Soviet people's revolutionary traditions, which had been abandoned by the Soviet revisionist leadership. These performances were often repeated due to the enthusiastic requests of the audience. Some people couldn't help but hum along softly. A spectator in Moscow said, "These revolutionary songs are no longer heard in Moscow, they have been forgotten, but you still sing them, that's great!" A female teacher in Leningrad said, "Your songs remind us of the past, giving us spiritual satisfaction and great encouragement, I and several spectators around me all shed tears."

Outside the performance venues, Soviet people often seized every opportunity to have friendly conversations with Chinese comrades, expressing their admiration for Chairman Mao in various ways.

On the first day the troupe arrived in Leningrad, while touring the city, they were enthusiastically surrounded by people in a square, turning it into a spontaneous Sino-Soviet friendship gathering. An old carpenter told the Chinese comrades, "We are the working class, we think Mao Zedong is correct. Mao Zedong is the same as our Lenin!" Once, an elderly worker specially waited at the theater entrance. When the Chinese comrades came out, he shouted in Chinese, "Long live Mao Zedong!"

In the coal mining area of Donbass, the capital Donetsk, while the troupe members were walking in the park, some workers enthusiastically approached them. A miner said, "We extend our warmest greetings to the Chinese people and the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong," "The friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China is great and unbreakable, please convey to Comrade Mao Zedong that the Soviet people are willing to cooperate with the Chinese people forever." A driver in his fifties told the Chinese performers, "On behalf of the Soviet working class, I salute Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong is a true Marxist-Leninist."

A worker in Moscow, upon seeing the members of the troupe, immediately said, "Mao Zedong—Lenin! Mao Zedong is in my heart!" An artist said, "Mao Zedong always does good for the people, always cares for the people." He requested to "convey the respect of the Soviet people to Mao Zedong."

An elderly person in Petrozavodsk told the Chinese comrades that his home always had portraits of Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong. He said, "They are our beloved leaders, forever in our hearts."

Some audience members also asked the performers to write "Mao Zedong" and "Long live Chairman Mao" in Chinese on the programs to keep as a permanent memento.

The badges of Chairman Mao brought by the troupe became the most cherished gifts among the Soviet people. An audience member in Moscow, after receiving the badge, shouted, "Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live Mao Zedong!" A miner in Donetsk, upon receiving the badge, couldn't help but shout, "Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong! We respect Comrade Mao Zedong, we support Mao Zedong Thought!" An elderly driver in the city carefully pinned the badge on his collar, proudly patting his chest and saying, "I wear the Mao Zedong badge at the highest place on my chest, so everyone can see it!"

The Soviet authorities, like bats fearing the light, did everything they could to obstruct the normal performances of the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe, attempting to limit the tremendous impact of the troupe's visit to the Soviet Union. For each performance by the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe, the relevant Soviet authorities only provided a small number of programs to the audience. Many audience members were dissatisfied with not being able to buy programs and directly requested them from the troupe. When the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe met some audience members' reasonable demands, the relevant Soviet authorities unreasonably protested against this. During the performance in Kadiyevka, the troupe's announcer's greeting to the audience and wishing for the development and consolidation of Sino-Soviet friendship was obstructed by Soviet personnel. Soviet personnel also obstructed audience members from talking with the troupe members, and some audience members were forcibly taken away while talking. During the first performance in Donetsk, a Soviet receptionist and a political hooligan shamelessly insulted the great leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong. The troupe, to express protest, suspended the performance in Donetsk. These vile acts by Soviet revisionists only further exposed their ugly faces but could not change the Soviet people's reverence for the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Comrade Mao Zedong, and their deep affection for the Chinese people.

The Beijing Song and Dance Troupe has already returned to the country in two batches on August 25 and 26 by train from Moscow.

The Beijing Song and Dance Troupe performed in a workshop of the Marx Machine Manufacturing Plant in Leningrad, warmly welcomed by the Soviet working-class masses.

After the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe's performance in a certain place in the Soviet Union, the audience and Chinese performers enthusiastically embraced.

   苏联人民欢呼：“我们热爱毛泽东！”
   北京歌舞团在苏联演出受到群众热烈欢迎
   苏联当局进行卑劣的挑衅活动　我歌舞团曾中止演出表示抗议
    新华社莫斯科二十七日电　中国北京歌舞团在苏联各地进行的为期二十多天的访问演出，受到苏联人民的热烈欢迎。苏联人民不顾苏联有关方面的阻挠和限制，纷纷表达了他们对当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志无比热爱的心情，请歌舞团转达他们对毛主席的敬意。
    北京歌舞团从七月二十七日到八月二十日，先后在苏联的卢干斯克、卡迪耶夫卡、顿涅茨克、莫斯科、列宁格勒、彼得罗扎沃次克等地举行了演出。
    苏联人民满怀激情热烈赞扬歌舞团演出的歌颂中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席和体现毛泽东思想的节目。
    在演出过程中，当舞蹈《伟大的节日》的帷幕拉开，在舞台上出现毛主席像时，观众立即沸腾起来，发出热烈的掌声。歌颂伟大的毛泽东思想的歌曲《大海航行靠舵手》、表现中国工农红军在毛主席领导下胜利进行二万五千里长征的光辉业绩的长征组歌《红军不怕远征难》等节目，使苏联观众深受感动。在卢干斯克，一位观众听了《大海航行靠舵手》以后，激动得流出了眼泪，振臂高呼：“好！好！”一位剧场工作人员看了长征组歌的表演后说：“毛泽东真伟大！”卢干斯克矿山机械厂一位工人看了这个节目后说：“毛泽东是我们的朋友，我们热爱毛泽东！”列宁格勒一位女观众激动地说：“你们继承了革命。毛泽东在领导着你们。毛泽东是最正确的，他在斗争中最坚定。”在彼得罗扎沃次克演出时，观众中有人在热烈的鼓掌声中高呼“苏中两国人民的伟大友谊万岁！中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东万岁！”
    莫斯科一位参加过多年武装斗争的七十高龄的观众，在看了体现毛主席全民皆兵思想的舞蹈《塞上女民兵》以后说：“毛泽东正确。应该拿起枪，因为帝国主义还存在。姑娘们应该武装起来。”许多观众在看了反映亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民革命斗争的《捣毁“战略村”》、《风雷颂》等歌曲和舞蹈节目以后，连声赞扬。列宁格勒一位女观众表示热烈拥护毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的论断。她说：“帝国主义是纸老虎，这句话很对。你们看，越南人民打了几年，已经取得了很大的胜利。你们不怕帝国主义，这是对的。”她一再表示，这不只是她一个人的意见，而是代表着许多人的看法。
    歌舞团这次演出的节目中体现的毛主席关于文艺为工农兵服务的方针，得到了苏联人民的热烈称赞。歌舞团印赠的节目单印上了毛主席语录：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”观众们看了纷纷表示赞同。他们说：“在你们的节目里表现了工农兵的形象，使我们非常兴奋”，这些节目“特别富有思想性”，“很富于革命性”，“反映了人民的战斗精神”，“这才是革命的节目”。
    中国演员们演唱的苏联革命歌曲《光明赞》、《共青团员之歌》、《神圣的战争》等，激起了苏联观众对已被苏共修正主义领导集团抛弃了的苏联人民革命传统的回忆。这些节目经常由于观众的热烈要求而再演一遍。有的人情不自禁地跟着低声哼起来。莫斯科的一位观众说：“这些革命歌曲现在在莫斯科是听不到的，已经被忘记了，但是你们还唱，太好了！”列宁格勒一位女教师说：“你们的歌声使我们回忆起过去的年代，使我们在精神上得到了满足，受到了莫大的鼓舞，我和周围的几个观众都流了泪。”
    在演出场外，苏联人民经常利用一切机会同中国同志亲切交谈，用各种方式表达对毛主席的敬仰。
    歌舞团团员在刚到列宁格勒的第一天参观市容时，在一个广场上被人们热情地围起来，成为一次自发的中苏人民友好联欢会。一位老木工对中国同志说：“我们是工人阶级，我们认为毛泽东是正确的。毛泽东同我们的列宁是一样的！”有一次，一位白发苍苍的老工人特地等在剧场门口，当中国同志出来时，他用中国话高呼：“毛泽东万岁！”
    在苏联煤矿区顿巴斯的首府顿涅茨克，歌舞团团员在公园里散步时，一些工人热情地迎上前来。一位矿工说：“我们向中国人民和中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志致以最亲切的问候”，“苏中两国人民的友谊是伟大的，牢不可破的，请向毛泽东同志转告，苏联人民愿意同中国人民永世合作”。一位年约五十岁的汽车司机对中国演员说：“我代表苏联工人阶级向毛泽东致敬！毛泽东是真正的马克思列宁主义者。”
    莫斯科的一位工人一见到歌舞团同志们就说：“毛泽东—列宁！”“毛泽东在我的心里！”一位艺术家说：“毛泽东永远为人民做好事，永远关心人民。”他要求“向毛泽东转致苏联人民的敬意。”
    彼得罗扎沃次克一位老人对中国同志说，他的家里一直挂着列宁、斯大林和毛泽东的像。他说：“他们是我们敬爱的领袖，永远记在我们的心中。”
    一些观众还让歌舞团演员在节目单上用中文写上“毛泽东”、“毛主席万岁”，以留作永久的纪念。
    歌舞团带去的毛主席纪念章，成了最受苏联人民欢迎的珍贵礼品。莫斯科一位观众要到了纪念章以后高呼“中国共产党万岁！毛泽东万岁！”顿涅茨克一位矿工拿到纪念章时情不自禁地喊道：“毛泽东！毛泽东！我们尊敬毛泽东同志，我们拥护毛泽东思想！”这个城市一位老年司机把纪念章小心翼翼地别在衣领上，拍着胸脯自豪地说：“我把毛泽东纪念章挂在胸前最高处，要让人们都能看到！”
    苏联当局像蝙蝠害怕阳光一样，千方百计阻挠北京歌舞团正常的演出活动，妄图限制歌舞团访苏演出的巨大影响。北京歌舞团每场演出，苏联有关方面只向观众供应少量的节目单。许多观众对买不到节目单十分不满，纷纷直接向歌舞团索取。当北京歌舞团满足一些观众的合理要求时，苏联有关方面却曾无理地就此向歌舞团提出“抗议”。在卡迪耶夫卡演出时，歌舞团报幕员向观众致意和祝中苏人民友谊发展和巩固，竟受到了苏方人员的阻挠。苏方人员还阻挠观众同歌舞团团员交谈，有的观众在交谈时被人强行架走。在顿涅茨克演出第一场时，苏方接待人员和一个政治流氓曾无耻到公然侮辱中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志。歌舞团为表示抗议，中止了在顿涅茨克的演出。苏联修正主义者这些卑劣的作法，只能进一步暴露他们丑恶的嘴脸，但绝无法改变苏联人民对当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志的崇敬和对中国人民的深厚感情。
