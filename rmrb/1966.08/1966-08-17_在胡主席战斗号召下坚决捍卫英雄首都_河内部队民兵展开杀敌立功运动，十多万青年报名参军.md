Under the battle call of Chairman Ho, the people of Hanoi are determined to defend their heroic capital. The military and militia of Hanoi have launched a campaign to kill the enemy and achieve merit, with over ten thousand young people volunteering to join the army.

New China News Agency, Hanoi, August 15th: Our reporter reports: The new act of aggression by American bandit planes on August 13th, bombing the Red River dike and residential areas of the capital Hanoi of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, has aroused even greater indignation among the people of Hanoi. They firmly declare that the American bandits can destroy our cities and kill our compatriots, but they will never shake our iron will to fight to the end and annihilate the American bandits.

Inspired by the great battle call of Chairman Ho, the military and people of Hanoi are truly the heroic military and people of the heroic capital. From June 29th, when American bandit planes bombed Hanoi, to August 14th, they have shot down 15 American planes and captured a large number of American air pirates.

Since July 17th, when Chairman Ho issued his great battle call, over ten thousand young men and women in Hanoi have enthusiastically volunteered to join the army, ready to go to the front line at any moment to fight the enemy. Many citizens have written letters of determination to Chairman Ho, expressing their resolve to sacrifice everything to defend the heroic capital and every inch of the motherland. The soldiers and the entire militia of the people's army are fighting with unprecedented high morale to win the "decisive unit" and "decisive soldier" campaign to kill the enemy and achieve merit. On the banks of the Red River, the soldiers are seizing every opportunity to practice their combat skills, learning from each other and exchanging combat experiences. Based on the new patterns of enemy aircraft activity, they are revising their combat plans and strategies, forming an even more tightly-knit air defense network. Recently, many enemy planes shot down by the people of Hanoi were struck down as soon as they entered the city's airspace, before they could cause any harm.

The militia self-defense teams in various districts of Hanoi and the suburbs are further consolidating and strengthening their existing air defense organizations. They have trained a large number of people's engineers and liaisons and are conducting intensive combat drills. The militia in the suburbs, such as the villages of Phu Tho in Tu Liem County, are implementing the policy of long-term arduous struggle and are also conducting drills to defend their villages. The militia in Phu Tho village, which was bombed by American bandit planes on August 13th, are filled with new and old grievances and are actively participating in the competition to kill the enemy and train soldiers. Over 200 militia members in this village have volunteered to join the army or the Anti-American Rescue National Youth Shock Brigade.

The soldiers of the Vietnamese People's Army Air Defense Force, who guard Hanoi day and night, on August 14th, when a group of American air bandits attempted to enter Hanoi's airspace to commit atrocities, immediately shot down two planes with heroic anti-aircraft fire and captured the cowardly American air pirates who were trying to escape.

　　在胡主席战斗号召下坚决捍卫英雄首都
　　河内部队民兵展开杀敌立功运动，十多万青年报名参军
    新华社河内十五日电  本社记者报道：美国强盗飞机十三日悍然轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内市红河堤坝和居民区的新的侵略罪行，激起河内市军民更大的愤慨，他们坚定地表示，美国强盗可以炸毁我们的城市，杀害我们的同胞，但是，绝对动摇不了我们战斗到底，消灭美国强盗的钢铁意志。
    在胡主席的伟大战斗号召鼓舞下，河内市军民不愧为英雄首都的英雄军民。从六月二十九日美国强盗飞机轰炸河内以来，到八月十四日为止，他们就击落美机十五架，并且活捉了一大批美国飞贼。
    从七月十七日胡主席发出伟大的战斗号召以后，河内市已有十多万男女青年踊跃报名参军，整装待发，随时准备听从祖国的召唤，奔赴前线杀敌。许多市民写决心书送给胡主席，表示决心不惜一切牺牲，为保卫英雄首都和祖国的每一寸土地而战斗到底。人民军指战员和全体民兵以空前高涨的决战决胜气势，投入争取“决胜单位”和“决胜战士”的杀敌立功运动。在红河两岸的土地上，战士们一面抓紧战斗空隙大练杀敌本领，一面互相学习，交流战斗经验，根据敌机活动的新规律，修订战斗计划和作战方案，组成全民更加严密的防空火网。最近，河内市军民打下的许多敌机都是在它们刚刚窜入市区上空，还未来得及逞凶的时候就被击落的。
    河内市各街区和市郊各县的民兵自卫队，也正在进一步巩固和加强原有的防空组织，并培养了大批的人民工兵和联络员，进行紧张的战斗演习。市郊慈廉县富溪等乡的民兵，贯彻长期艰苦抗战的方针，还进行了保卫村庄的战斗演习。在十三日遭受美国强盗飞机轰炸的富舍乡民兵怀着新仇旧恨，积极投入杀敌练兵竞赛。这个乡的二百多名民兵已报名参军或参加了抗美救国青年突击队。
    日夜捍卫着河内市的越南人民军防空部队的指战员们，十四日，当一批美国空中强盗妄图窜入河内市上空行凶时，当即被英雄的防空炮火击落两架，并活捉了怕死逃生的美国飞贼。
