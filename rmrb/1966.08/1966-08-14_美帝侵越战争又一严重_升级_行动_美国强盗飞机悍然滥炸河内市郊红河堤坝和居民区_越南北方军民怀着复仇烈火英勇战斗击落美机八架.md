The U.S. imperialists on August 13 once again brazenly sent planes to savagely bomb the suburbs of Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, including the Red River dike and residential areas, committing another heinous crime.

This is another serious "escalation" of the war since June 29 when U.S. planes brazenly bombed Hanoi.

At around noon on August 13, a batch of U.S. F-105 jet fighters invaded the airspace over Hanoi and savagely attacked the Red River dike in the northwestern suburbs, as well as the residential areas of Phu Xuyen and Nhi Nhon communes. In addition to dropping heavy bombs, the U.S. air pirates also used cluster bombs and rockets, destroying a section of the Red River dike, blowing up dozens of civilian houses, and killing and injuring many peaceful residents, most of whom were women and children.

The new heinous crime committed by the U.S. aggressors has infuriated the military and civilian population of Hanoi. With a burning desire for revenge, they bravely fought back, delivering a heavy blow to the U.S. air pirates.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 12 — According to a report released here on the evening of August 12, in the afternoon of August 12, multiple batches of U.S. pirate planes invaded the airspace over the provinces of Binh Thuan, Lang Son, and An Phu in northern Vietnam. The military and civilian population of these areas, in close coordination with the People's Air Force, bravely fought back and immediately shot down three U.S. pirate planes and damaged several more.

The military and civilian population of this province, in close coordination with the People's Air Force, shot down one U.S. unmanned high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft and one jet fighter in one go.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 12 — The people of Hai Phong, the second-largest city in northern Vietnam, and the broad masses of militia self-defense corps members, under the great battle call of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, bravely fought and persisted in production, achieving great victories. By the end of July and early August, in the battle to defend the dikes, the military and civilian population along the coast shot down four enemy planes and damaged several more, severely punishing the U.S. air pirates. After the battle, the militia units and youth shock troops along the coast, together with the local agricultural cooperative members, immediately joined the struggle to repair the dikes and engage in production. The broad masses of militia self-defense corps in Hai Phong also seized every opportunity to intensify military training, further improving their combat skills, determined to defend their heroic city.
