Our great leader Chairman Mao inspected a million-person proletarian cultural revolution army in the capital, further mobilizing the revolutionary enthusiasm of the 700 million people across the nation. In recent days, people across the country have held celebrations, vowing to carry forward the spirit of the proletarian revolution with "daring" as the core, sweeping away all ghosts and monsters, and removing all obstacles to the cultural revolution.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 22nd, our great leader Chairman Mao's unprecedented inspection of a million-person proletarian cultural revolution army in the capital has further mobilized the revolutionary enthusiasm of the 700 million people across the nation. In recent days, celebrations have been held across the country, with millions of people expressing their determination to continue carrying forward the spirit of the proletarian revolution with "daring" as the core, sweeping away all ghosts and monsters, and removing all obstacles to the cultural revolution.

Revolutionary masses across the country have emphasized that to better carry forward the revolutionary spirit with "daring" as the core, to dare to revolutionize, to be good at revolutionizing, and to achieve victory in the cultural revolution, we must better study, be familiar with, master, and apply the "Sixteen Points," using this programmatic document, personally drafted by Chairman Mao, as the highest directive for the cultural revolution.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres in the capital have resolutely responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call on behalf of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, continuing to carry forward the revolutionary spirit with "daring" as the core, launching a comprehensive offensive against bourgeois and all exploitative class ideologies. To win this great battle, people in the movement have more consciously, broadly, and enthusiastically launched a wave of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and the "Sixteen Points."

Since the movement began, revolutionary teachers and students at Beijing Petroleum Institute, who have consistently practiced studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, have held meetings in recent days to study and apply the "Sixteen Points," further arming themselves. The Cultural Revolution Committee of Beijing Steel Plant held an all-committee meeting the night of the capital's celebration of the proletarian cultural revolution, arranging the movement and production work for the fourth quarter according to the spirit of the "Sixteen Points," ensuring that the cultural revolution and production go hand in hand. The next day, the plant held a meeting for all employees, fully mobilizing the masses to discuss how to grasp the revolution and promote production, making the cultural revolution a powerful driving force for developing productive forces. The Cultural Revolution Preparatory Committee of Peking University, based on the "Sixteen Points," reviewed and summarized the previous phase of the movement, deciding to further launch the movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and the "Sixteen Points" across the university, using Mao Zedong Thought and the "Sixteen Points" as the guide for action, thoroughly overthrowing, overthrowing, and exposing the black gang of Lu Ping and Peng Peiyun, and carrying out the cultural revolution deeply and thoroughly. Many schools' Red Guards, while studying the "Sixteen Points" and becoming familiar with them, also apply them, strengthening and developing the team, determined to unite the majority, win over the middle elements, and carry out the cultural revolution well.

Over 60,000 revolutionary teachers, students, and staff from various ethnic groups, along with some cadres from government agencies in Hohhot, the capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, held a rally this afternoon to launch a fierce attack on the anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought black gang in schools. Thirteen revolutionary teachers and students from various schools spoke at the rally. They expressed their determination to act according to Chairman Mao's instructions and the "Sixteen Points," carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to venture, daring to act, daring to revolutionize, and daring to rebel, and carrying out the proletarian cultural revolution to the end.

Today, 100,000 revolutionary masses in Zhengzhou held a grand rally and parade. Liu Jianxun, the first secretary of the CPC Henan Provincial Committee, spoke at the meeting, calling on the broad revolutionary masses to take on the glorious task of overthrowing the old world and building a new world, daring to make a revolution. In the struggle, one must seriously study the "Sixteen Points," become familiar with them, master them, and apply them, carrying out the proletarian cultural revolution to the end.

The workers of the oxygen station in the auxiliary workshop of the Nanning Smelting Plant, an advanced unit for studying Chairman Mao's works in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, have repeatedly studied the "Sixteen Points" in recent days, comparing each point with the situation in their unit, identifying problems, and immediately improving them, making the movement more powerful.

The news of Chairman Mao inspecting a million-person revolutionary army in the capital reached Fangxiang Commune in Yanzhou County, Jiangsu Province. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants were excited to say: Chairman Mao personally leads the cultural revolution, stomping on the ghosts and monsters. The "Sixteen Points" shine with golden light, and the communiqué's brilliance illuminates the four seas. Our most beloved leader Chairman Mao, our red flowers will forever bloom in the sun, blooming for a thousand years, for ten thousand generations, never fading. Fang Deming, an active member of the study of Chairman Mao's works and a militia platoon leader in the brigade, said: We must carry forward the revolutionary spirit with "daring" as the core, together with the proletarian revolutionary factions across the country, learning from each other and supporting each other, exposing all ghosts and monsters, exposing all bad elements obstructing the proletarian cultural revolution, and overthrowing them all.

The revolutionary youngsters of Guangzhou's 45th Middle School, who have been tested in the storm of the proletarian cultural revolution and have resolutely repelled the frenzied counterattack of bourgeois elements, walked dozens of miles to the location of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee to express their determination. In their determination letter, they said, Chairman Mao stands with us, Chairman Mao fights with us, which has given us boundless courage and confidence, and provided us with endless fighting strength. They expressed their determination to always listen to Chairman Mao's words, to definitely care about state affairs, to be daring, and to thoroughly make a revolution.

Cai Ziquan, the director of the Electroluminescent Source Laboratory at Fudan University and a model for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in Shanghai, was extremely excited upon hearing the news of Chairman Mao meeting a million revolutionary masses in the capital, raising his hand and shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" He said: Chairman Mao inspecting the revolutionary army at Tiananmen is the greatest encouragement to the revolutionary people. The "Sixteen Points," personally drafted by Chairman Mao, are the great program for the proletarian cultural revolution, the steering wheel, compass, and the latest embodiment of Mao Zedong Thought. We must study and apply them well, and resolutely implement them in practical actions.
