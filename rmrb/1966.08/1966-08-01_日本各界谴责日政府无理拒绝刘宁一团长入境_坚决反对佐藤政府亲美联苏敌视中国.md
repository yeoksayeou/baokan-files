Japanese Circles Condemn Japanese Government's Unreasonable Refusal of Liu Ningyi's Entry
Firmly Oppose Sato Government's Pro-American, Pro-Soviet, Anti-China Stance

	TOKYO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Socialist Party Secretary-General Nariaki Narita issued a statement today strongly condemning the Japanese government's unreasonable refusal to allow Liu Ningyi, head of the Chinese delegation to the 12th World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, to enter the country. He emphasized that this is a blatant manifestation of the Sato government's policy of hostility towards China.

	Narita said that the Japanese government recently refused to allow a delegation from the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, invited by the Japanese Socialist Party, to enter the country. Now, it is refusing Liu Ningyi's entry. The Japanese Socialist Party particularly noted that the Japanese government's measure to refuse Liu Ningyi's entry was taken after the fifth Japan-U.S. Trade and Economic Joint Committee meeting and the "ministerial meeting of anti-communist countries and puppet regimes in the Asia-Pacific region."

	Narita stressed that due to the Japanese government's repeated refusal to allow Chinese representatives to enter the country, it can be foreseen that economic and cultural exchanges between Japan and China, especially trade between the two countries based on the Memorandum of Understanding between Liao Chengzhi and Takasugi Tadayoshi, will face a serious crisis.

	TOKYO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Japanese figures from various circles continued to speak to Chinese journalists today, condemning the Sato government's reactionary line of pro-American, pro-Soviet, and anti-China, and brazenly refusing entry to Liu Ningyi, head of the Chinese delegation to the 12th World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs.

	Ms. Kushi Tada, chairperson of the Japanese Federation of Women's Organizations, said that the reasons given by the Japanese Ministry of Justice for refusing Liu Ningyi's entry are completely untenable. The Chinese delegation is a whole, and the Japanese government's unreasonable refusal to allow the delegation head to enter is a deliberate obstruction of the entire delegation's entry. Kushi said: In previous World Conferences against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, Chinese delegations have always participated. The consistent actions of the Chinese delegation show that they are the most steadfast anti-imperialist forces. The Sato government's obstruction of the Chinese delegation's entry is a major hindrance to this World Conference and is also another obstacle to the development of friendly relations between the peoples of Japan and China.

	Kushi said: The Sato government, on the one hand, is further following the United States and tightening its collusion with the new Soviet leadership, while on the other hand, it is hostile to China and refuses to allow Chinese representatives to enter the country. This reflects the essence of Sato's reactionary diplomacy.

	Kushi condemned the collusion between the new Soviet leadership and the Sato government. She said: "The new Soviet leadership is so friendly with the Sato government, which supports the U.S. expansion of the Vietnam War, this makes us see more clearly their true colors."

	Hiroshi Haruki, chairman of the Japan Socialist Party's Special Committee for Restoring Sino-Japanese Relations and a member of the Diet, said that the Japanese government's fabricated reasons for refusing Liu Ningyi's entry are groundless. He said: "The Sato government's actions, following the refusal of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs delegation invited by the Socialist Party to enter the country, are once again violating the will of the Japanese people who hope for friendly relations between the peoples of Japan and China, and setting obstacles to the development of friendly relations between the two peoples."

	Haruki pointed out: The Sato government says it adopts an attitude of "looking forward" towards China, but in reality, it consistently follows the U.S. policy of "containing" China and adopts an attitude of hostility towards China, which is firmly opposed by the Japanese people.

	Haruki pointed out: In the context of increasingly close U.S.-Soviet relations, the Sato government is implementing a policy of pro-American, pro-Soviet, and anti-China. The series of actions it has taken, including this obstruction of Liu Ningyi's entry, to disrupt the friendly relations between the peoples of Japan and China, are all based on this policy.

    日本各界谴责日政府无理拒绝刘宁一团长入境
    坚决反对佐藤政府亲美联苏敌视中国
    新华社东京二十九日电　日本社会党书记长成田知巳二十九日发表谈话，强烈谴责日本政府无理拒绝中国出席第十二届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会代表团团长刘宁一入境。他强调指出，这是佐藤政府“推行敌视中国政策的露骨表现”。
    成田说，日本政府不久以前曾经拒绝过日本社会党邀请的中国人民外交学会访日代表团入境，现在又拒绝刘宁一团长入境。日本社会党特别注意到这个事实：日本政府拒绝刘宁一团长入境的措施是在第五次日美贸易和经济事务联合委员会会议和“亚洲太平洋地区反共
  （国家和傀儡集团）部长会议”举行之后做出的。
    成田着重指出，由于日本政府接二连三地拒绝中国代表入境，可以想见日中两国的经济、文化交流，特别是根据廖承志—高碕达之助备忘录进行的日中贸易，将面临严重的危机。
    新华社东京三十日电日本各界著名人士今天继续向中国记者发表谈话，谴责日本佐藤政府奉行亲美、联苏、反华的反动路线，悍然拒绝出席第十二届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的中国代表团团长刘宁一入境。
    日本妇女团体联合会会长栉田蕗说，日本法务省当局所说的拒绝刘宁一团长入境的理由是完全站不住脚的。中国代表团是一个整体，日本政府无理拒绝代表团团长入境，就是蓄意阻挠整个代表团入境。栉田说：过去历届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会，都有中国代表团参加。中国代表团的一贯的行动，表明他们是最坚定的反帝力量。佐藤政府阻挠中国代表团入境，这是对这届世界大会的重大妨碍，同时也是对日中两国人民的友好关系的发展设置的又一个新的障碍。
    栉田说：佐藤政府一方面在进一步追随美国，加紧同苏联新领导勾结，一方面敌视中国，拒绝中国代表入境，这正反映了佐藤反动外交的本质。
    栉田谴责苏联修正主义领导勾结佐藤政府。她说：“苏联新领导今天那么亲热地同支持美国扩大侵越战争的佐藤政府勾搭，这使我们越来越看清了它们的面目。”
    日本社会党恢复日中邦交特别委员会委员长、国会议员原彪说，日本政府制造借口拒绝刘宁一团长入境，是没有任何道理的。他说：“佐藤政府的行动是继拒绝社会党邀请的中国人民外交学会代表团入境之后，又一次违背期望日中人民友好的日本人民的意志，为阻挠两国人民友好关系发展设下障碍。”
    原彪指出：佐藤政府口头上说对中国的关系采取“向前看”的态度，实际上正相反，它一贯追随美国的“遏制”中国政策，采取敌视中国的态度，这是日本人民坚决反对的。
    原彪指出：在美苏关系越来越亲密的情况下，佐藤政府正在执行着亲美、联苏、反华的政策。它采取的包括这次阻挠刘宁一团长入境在内的一系列破坏日中两国人民友好的行动，都是从这个政策出发的。
