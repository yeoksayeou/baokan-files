The red flag flies over the Anti-Imperialist Building. The imperialist aggression symbol—a copper model ship—set on the roof of the Anti-Imperialist Building (formerly known as Wuhan Port) in Hankou was torn down yesterday by Red Guards and revolutionary masses and smashed to pieces. The surrounding crowd shouted in unison: "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the revolutionary spirit of the proletarian revolution!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"

The Anti-Imperialist Building was formerly known as "Jianghan Customs House." It was a tool used by imperialists to oppress and exploit the Chinese people.

During this movement to sweep away the "Four Olds," the Red Guards and revolutionary masses of Wuhan proposed renaming this building the "Anti-Imperialist Building."

On the 24th, three Young Pioneers posted a big-character poster at the Lake North Province Foreign Trade Bureau located in this building, demanding that the workers quickly remove this imperialist ship! The revolutionary workers here immediately accepted the initiative of these three young revolutionaries and took down the copper model ship.

On the 26th, the revolutionary workers of the Lake North Province Foreign Trade Bureau held a naming ceremony for the Anti-Imperialist Building. The Red Guards carried the dismantled copper model ship and smashed it to pieces in front of the steps of the Anti-Imperialist Building, and then stomped on it. The entire scene was filled with excitement. The slogan "Down with Imperialism!" echoed through the sky.

The three revolutionary young pioneers who posted the big-character poster were also invited to attend the meeting. The revolutionary workers of the Foreign Trade Bureau presented them with "Quotations from Chairman Mao." A representative of the revolutionary young pioneers said at the meeting: "Chairman Mao teaches us to care about state affairs and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. What we do is to follow Chairman Mao's words. Chairman Mao also said: 'Rebellion is justified.' Wherever there are monsters and demons, wherever there are old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits to rebel against, we will go there to fight. We must learn the revolutionary spirit of the proletarian revolution from our revolutionary forebears, make a big fuss against the bourgeoisie, make a big fuss against imperialism, make a big fuss against revisionism, thoroughly sweep away the 'Four Olds,' and establish the 'Four News,' to be good children of Chairman Mao, and carry the revolution through to the end!"

    反帝大楼红旗飘
    设置在汉口反帝大楼（原名武汉关）屋顶上的帝国主义侵略标记——铜制模型船，昨天被红卫兵和革命群众拆了下来，当众砸得稀巴烂。四周的群众齐声欢呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“无产阶级革命造反精神万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”
    反帝大楼就是解放前的“江汉关”。它是帝国主义压迫剥削中国人民的工具。
    在这次横扫“四旧”的革命运动中，武汉的红卫兵们和革命群众，倡议把这座大楼命名为“反帝大楼”。
    二十四日，三个少先队员给设在这所大楼的湖北省对外贸易局贴了一张大字报，要求职工赶快把这个帝国主义的船拿下来！这里的革命职工立即接受了三个革命小闯将的倡议，把这只铜制模型船拆了下来。
    湖北省对外贸易局的革命职工，在二十六日举行了反帝大楼命名大会。红卫兵们抬着拆下的铜制模型船，高高举起，在反帝大楼台阶前把它砸得稀巴烂，并且踩在脚下。这时全场一片欢腾。“打倒帝国主义！”的口号声响彻云霄。
    贴革命大字报的三个革命小闯将也应邀出席了大会。对外贸易局的革命职工把《毛主席语录》赠给他们。革命小将的代表在会上说：“毛主席教导我们要关心国家大事，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。我们这样做，就是听毛主席的话。毛主席还说：
  ‘造反有理’。哪里有牛鬼蛇神，有旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯可反，我们就到哪里去战斗。我们要学习革命先辈的无产阶级革命精神，大造资产阶级的反，大造帝国主义的反，大造修正主义的反，大破‘四旧’，大立‘四新’，作毛主席的好孩子，革命到底！”
