	Running the Grain Shop According to Chairman Mao's Instructions

	Study Chairman Mao's works to transform the workers' worldview; use Mao Zedong Thought to arm the residents' minds.

	An Yang City Youth Grain Shop Manager Zheng Donglin

	Our great leader Chairman Mao recently called on all sectors to become revolutionary schools like the PLA. We, the workers of the grain shop, feel particularly close to this wise instruction from Chairman Mao. The Youth Grain Shop has been named an advanced collective for ten consecutive years, earning the trust and love of the surrounding residents. The fundamental reason is that we have unwaveringly followed Chairman Mao's words, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm and transform people. Over the past ten years, twenty-five workers have worked in our grain shop, with an average age of only over twenty. Fifteen of these young people have been transferred out and have become the backbone and leaders of various grain shops. Now, ten young people in the grain shop have been evaluated as five-good workers and single-item champions.

	When these batches of young people first entered the grain shop, some complained about the dirt and hard work; some thought selling grain was lowly; some only cared about earning money to support their families. Most people had not established a worldview of serving the people.

	We followed Chairman Mao's teachings on "the transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation," organizing workers to study the "Three Articles," repeatedly learning and applying them. In the minds of every young person, we opened up a battlefield to promote proletarian awareness and eliminate bourgeois thoughts. They took Zhang Sided and White as examples, greatly raising their proletarian consciousness, gradually recognizing that a socialist grain shop is not just about doing business but concretely embodies the Party's care for the people's lives. Everyone, with full enthusiasm, went out of the grain shop, deeply into the residential areas, treating the people's difficulties as their own, and did many good deeds for the people, truly blending in with the people. Once, An Yang City experienced seven or eight days of heavy rain, and some residents could not come out to buy grain. The workers braved the torrential rain and waded through knee-deep water to deliver the grain to the people's homes. This year in March, An Yang City experienced an earthquake. The grain shop workers voluntarily set up awnings in the courtyard to accommodate nearby residents; for a few elderly and infirm widows, they carried them in on chairs at night and carried them back in the morning. Everyone insisted on business during the day and stood guard for the people at night. Therefore, the people all called our workers the "People's Children" on the commercial front.

	We followed Chairman Mao's teachings on propagating, organizing, and arming the masses. Last year, we helped the streets set up the first resident study group for Chairman Mao's works. Now, the resident study groups for Chairman Mao's works have expanded to eighteen, and all residents within the grain shop's supply range have participated in the study. In addition to guiding the work, the grain shop workers also donated more than one hundred single-volume editions of Chairman Mao's works to the resident groups and helped the residents set up quotation boards in every household. Therefore, the people praised the grain shop workers as enthusiastic propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought.

	We combined Chairman Mao's wise instructions, reviewed our own work, and felt that we had not done enough for the people. We are determined to truly turn the Youth Grain Shop into a school of Mao Zedong Thought and cultivate our workers into highly politically conscious, all-around developed new communist people.

### 照毛主席的指示办粮店

　　照毛主席的指示办粮店
    读毛主席的书，改造职工世界观；用毛泽东思想，武装居民头脑。
　　安阳市青年粮店主任　郑东林
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席最近号召各行各业都要象解放军那样，办成革命化的大学校。我们粮店职工学习毛主席这个英明指示，感到格外亲切。青年粮店连续十年保持先进集体的称号，受到周围居民的信任和爱戴，最根本的原因，是坚定不移地听毛主席的话，用毛泽东思想武装人、改造人。十年之中，在我们粮店工作过的二十五名职工，平均年龄不过二十多岁，有十五个青年已经调出去，成了各粮店基层领导和骨干；现在粮店的十名青年，大部分被评为五好职工和单项标兵。
    这一茬茬小青年刚走进粮店的时候，有的嫌脏怕累；有的认为卖粮食低三下四；有的光为挣钱养家，大多数人都没有树立为人民服务的世界观。
    我们按着毛主席关于“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”的教导，组织职工学习“老三篇”，反复学、反复用，在每个青年的头脑中开辟兴无灭资的战场。他们以张思德、白求恩为榜样，大大提高了无产阶级觉悟，逐渐认识到社会主义的粮店，绝不是单纯做买卖，而是具体体现着党对群众生活的关怀。大家以满腔热情走出粮店，深入街道居民区，把群众的困难当作自己的困难，为群众办了许许多多好事，真正和群众打成了一片。有一次，安阳市一连下了七八天大雨，一些居民没办法出来买粮食，职工们就顶着瓢泼大雨，趟着过膝的深水，把粮食背到群众家里去。今年三月，安阳市发生地震。粮店职工自动在院里搭起凉棚，把附近的群众接来住；对几户年纪大不便行动的孤寡老人，晚上用椅子抬来，早晨再抬回去。大家白天坚持营业，晚上为群众值班站岗。因此，群众都把我们职工叫作商业战线上的人民子弟兵。
    我们根据毛主席关于宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众的教导，去年帮助街道办起了第一个居民学习毛主席著作小组。现在，居民学习毛主席著作小组已扩大为十八个，粮店供应范围内的街道居民都参加了学习。粮店职工除担任辅导工作外，还送给居民小组一百多册毛主席著作单行本，帮助居民挨家挨户建立了语录牌，因此，群众称赞粮店职工是毛泽东思想的热情宣传员。
    我们结合毛主席的英明指示，对照自己的工作，感到群众工作还做得很不够，决心把青年粮店真正办成毛泽东思想的大学校，把我们的职工真正培养成有高度政治觉悟的、全面发展的共产主义新人。
