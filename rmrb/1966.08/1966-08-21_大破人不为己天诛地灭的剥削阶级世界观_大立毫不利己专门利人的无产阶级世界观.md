Recently, the Party branch of Kongxi Commune in Huangmei County, Hubei, launched a campaign among the masses to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology. They thoroughly criticized the reactionary old worldview of the exploitative class, "If you don't look out for yourself, heaven will punish you and earth will destroy you," and established the revolutionary new worldview of the proletariat, which is to be selfless and serve others wholeheartedly.

This campaign was initiated by criticizing a well-off middle peasant. Once, the leader of the third production team criticized a certain well-off middle peasant for being too selfish. The person responded nonchalantly, "If you don't look out for yourself, heaven will punish you and earth will destroy you. Don't you cadres have any selfish motives?" At that time, several people held similar views. Although their expressions and degrees varied, they all revolved around self-interest. They regarded self-interest as a natural and justifiable thing. This is a thorough bourgeois worldview. Its roots run deep, and its influence is harmful. If this reactionary old "eight-character view" is not overturned, it will bring great harm to the revolutionary cause.

To promote public interest and eliminate private gain, the Party branch organized the commune members to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "On the Rectification of Work Styles." They specifically highlighted the eight characters "selfless and serve others wholeheartedly" from Chairman Mao's works to engage in a head-on struggle against the old "eight-character view." They also promoted five exemplary figures: Norman Bethune, Zhang Zedong, Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and Jiao Yulu, widely and deeply, making their heroic images stand tall in people's minds.

During the study, poor and lower-middle peasants recalled their bitter pasts and denounced the old "eight-character view." They said, "In the old society filled with evil, landlords and capitalists shouted about everyone looking out for themselves, but in reality, only they, these bloodsuckers, gained power, status, and benefits. We poor people could only be oppressed and exploited, living under their feet. Now, under Chairman Mao's leadership, we have stood up and taken control. We are selfless and serve others wholeheartedly, dedicating ourselves to the collective and the revolution. We will no longer be deceived by such nonsense." Poor peasant Wang Zuorong angrily said, "Look out for yourself? Why yourself? In the past, I worked as a long-term laborer for the landlord, toiling in the mud and water from day to night, year after year, always ending up borrowing rice for the year!" Through reminiscence and comparison, the poor and lower-middle peasants saw clearly: the new "eight-character view" is the communist worldview, taught by Chairman Mao, which we should firmly learn and follow; the old "eight-character view" is the feudal and capitalist worldview, which we should firmly oppose and overthrow.

The new "eight-character view" changed the relationship between people. Everyone put the collective first, criticized and helped each other, and persistently fought against various manifestations of the old "eight-character view." Commune member Hu Xianen raised two cows for the team, and they were doing well, but he always tied the cows to the commune's small trees. The cows scratched themselves on the trees, damaging two of them. Old poor peasant Hu Dongsheng criticized him, but he did not accept it. Once, a commune member tied a cow to his family's tree, and he immediately shouted, "Who tied the cow? They ruined the tree!" Hu Dongsheng, standing by, said, "What are you shouting about? This is a public tree!" Hu Xianen, upon hearing this, flew into a rage, jumping up and down, saying, "It's clearly my family's tree, why do you say it's a public tree?" Hu Dongsheng seized the opportunity to criticize Hu Xianen, saying, "Your family's tree, someone else ties a cow to it, and you shout and jump; the public's tree, you damaged two of them, and you don't care at all. Tell me, what kind of thinking is this?" Hu Xianen immediately realized that he was putting self-interest first, was wrong, and silently walked away. After that, he never did such things again.

As the struggle deepened, more and more people were armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and good deeds emerged one after another.

The commune members of the third production team found a cow. Everyone was uneasy, feeling that during the busy farming season, losing draft cattle would cause many difficulties in production. Therefore, they took out two labor forces from their busy schedule and spent two whole days searching for the owner. Eight days later, the team that lost the cow sent two representatives, bringing a cigarette and three yuan. The cigarette was to reward the person who found the cow, and the money was for the feed cost. The commune members of the third production team refused to accept the cigarette and money, unanimously saying, "Taking care of a cow for a brother team for a few days, accepting rewards and feed costs, what kind of attitude is this!"

    大破人不为己天诛地灭的剥削阶级世界观
    大立毫不利己专门利人的无产阶级世界观
    胡烈斌
    前不久，湖北黄梅县孔西公社快乐大队党支部，在群众中开展了一场兴无灭资的斗争，大破剥削阶级“人不为己、天诛地灭”的反动的旧世界观，大立无产阶级毫不利己、专门利人的革命的新世界观。
    这场斗争，是从批评一个富裕中农引起的。有一次，第三生产队长批评某富裕中农私心太重。这个人满不在乎地说：“人不为己，天诛地灭。你们干部就没有私心吗？”当时，持这种论点的还有一些人。尽管说法不同，程度不一样，但都离不开为自己。他们把自私为己看成是天经地义的事。这是彻头彻尾的剥削阶级世界观。它的根子深，影响坏。不把这种反动的旧“八字观”打倒，将给革命事业带来极大的危害。
    为了破私立公，党支部组织社员学习《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》和《愚公移山》，并且从毛主席著作中专门提出“毫不利己专门利人”八个字，同旧“八字观”展开针锋相对的斗争。他们又先后提出了白求恩、张思德、雷锋、王杰、焦裕禄“五大典型”，进行广泛深入的宣传，使“五大典型”的英雄形象，巍然屹立在人们脑海之中。
    在学习中，贫下中农忆苦思甜，对旧“八字观”进行了控诉。他们说：“在万恶的旧社会，地主、资本家叫喊人人为己，实际上得权得势得利的是他们这些吸血鬼。我们穷人，只能受压迫受剥削，在他们脚底下过日子。现在毛主席领导我们翻了身，坐了天下，我们毫不利己，专门利人，一心为集体，一心为革命，再也不受这些鬼话的骗了。”贫农王祖荣气愤地说：“为己？为什么己啊！我祖荣过去替地主打长工，泥里水里，一天滚到黑，一年滚到头，年年落个借年饭米！”通过回忆对比，贫下中农看得很清楚：新“八字观”是共产主义世界观，是毛主席教导我们的，应该坚决学习，坚决照办；旧“八字观”是封建主义和资本主义世界观，应该坚决反对，坚决打倒。
    新“八字观”改变了人和人的关系。大家公字当头，互相批评，互相帮助，坚持不懈地同旧“八字观”的各种表现作斗争。社员胡先恩为队上放两头牛，养的还不错，但他总是把牛系在公家的小树上，牛在树上擦痒，毁坏了两棵。老贫农胡冬生批评他，他不接受。有一次，一个社员把牛系在他家的树上，他立即大吼大叫：“哪个系的牛呀，把树都搞坏了！”胡冬生在旁边说：“你吼么事？这是公家的树！”胡先恩一听火了，暴跳着说：“明明是我家的，怎么说是公家的呢？”胡冬生借此机会，批评胡先恩说：“你家的树，别人系牛，你暴跳如雷；公家的树，你糟踏了两棵，一点也不心疼。你说说，这是什么思想？”胡先恩马上想到自己是私字当头，亏了理，默不作声地走开，以后就再也不这样做了。
    随着斗争的不断深入，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人也越来越多，好人好事层出不穷。
    第三生产队社员拾到一条牛。大家很不安，都觉得农忙时丢失耕牛，生产上将会出现多少困难呀！于是，他们在百忙中抽出了两个劳力，花了整整两天时间，四处寻找失主。八天后，失牛的队派来两名代表，带来一条烟、三元钱。烟是酬谢拣牛人的，钱作为代养牛的草料费。第三生产队社员无论如何不肯接受烟和钱，一致说：“代兄弟队养几天牛，要人酬谢，要人给草料费，这算什么风格！”
