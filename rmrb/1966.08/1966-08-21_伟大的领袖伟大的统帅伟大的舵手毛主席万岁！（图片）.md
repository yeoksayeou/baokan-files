The great leader, the great supreme commander, and the great helmsman Chairman Mao, long live!

The great leader Chairman Mao, you are the red sun in our hearts. You always keep the major affairs of the Party, the state, and the people in mind. Criticizing the old world and creating a new world, you lead us forward. Great helmsman Chairman Mao, we will follow you closely, surmount all obstacles, and sail through all storms, letting the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly high all over the world.

	Wearing a green military uniform and a "Red Guard" armband, the great supreme commander Chairman Mao is simple, dignified, and benevolent! Beloved leader Chairman Mao, there are so many heartfelt words to tell you, so many affectionate songs to sing to you. In a thousand words and ten thousand sentences, it is just one sentence: Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. In the great storm of the cultural revolution, be a pioneer!
