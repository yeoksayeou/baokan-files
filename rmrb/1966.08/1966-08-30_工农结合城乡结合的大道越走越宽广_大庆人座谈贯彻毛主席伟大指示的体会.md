The workers and families of Daqing Oilfield, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, were greatly inspired after seeing Chairman Mao's instructions that all sectors should become revolutionary schools that are both industrial and agricultural, both cultural and military. In recent days, the oilfield has been filled with joy, with meetings and discussions taking place on drilling sites, near oil wells, and in villages. Every word and sentence of Chairman Mao's instructions feels very close to their hearts. They link these instructions with the actual experiences of the oilfield's six years of development, praising Chairman Mao's brilliance, greatness, and correctness, and praising the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought. They say: Chairman Mao mentioned Daqing in his instructions, setting higher standards for us. With Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership, we were able to conquer a world-class large oilfield in the past and build a new type of mining area that combines cities and countryside, industry and agriculture. In the future, we will definitely be able to turn the oilfield into a school of Mao Zedong Thought, forge ourselves into all-around developed new people who are both industrial and agricultural, both cultural and military, and follow Chairman Mao to ride the wind and break the waves, marching towards communism!

We invited some workers, families, and teachers and students from Daqing Oilfield to discuss Chairman Mao's great instructions. Below is a summary of their speeches.  Editor

    工农结合城乡结合的大道越走越宽广
    大庆人座谈贯彻毛主席伟大指示的体会
    毛泽东思想哺育起来的大庆油田职工和家属，看到毛主席关于各行各业都要办成亦工亦农、亦文亦武的革命化大学校的指示以后，受到了极大的鼓舞。连日来，油田到处喜气洋洋，钻井场上，采油井旁，工农村里，人们纷纷集会学习讨论。毛主席指示的一字一句，都使他们感到非常亲切。他们联系油田开发六年来的实际，歌颂毛主席的英明、伟大、正确，歌颂毛泽东思想的威力无穷。他们说：毛主席在指示里提到了大庆，给我们提出了更高的要求。有毛主席的英明领导，过去我们能拿下世界第一流的大油田，建设了城乡结合、工农结合的新型矿区，今后也一定能把油田办成毛泽东思想的大学校，把自己锻炼成为亦工亦农、亦文亦武全面发展的共产主义新人，跟着毛主席乘风破浪，奔向共产主义！
    我们请了一些大庆油田职工、家属和学校师生座谈毛主席的这个伟大指示，下面是发言纪要。　编者
