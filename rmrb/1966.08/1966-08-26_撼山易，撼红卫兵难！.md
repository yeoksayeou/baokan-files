The Red Guards are the loyal defenders of Mao Zedong Thought. Those exploiters and their masters chatter on and on, saying this is bad, that is bad, talking about how the "Red Guards are detached from the masses," how they are "leftist," and so on and so forth.

This is all nonsense!

The Red Guards must rebel against the exploiting classes, must rebel against all the monsters and demons, must destroy the "Four Olds" and establish the "Four News." The Red Guards, in this great Cultural Revolution, are bound to have some shortcomings and mistakes, and these can be criticized. We should humbly accept all well-intentioned criticisms from the revolutionary masses. But we must resolutely repel the malicious attacks from the exploiting class!

We study and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively, and have carried out a rectification campaign. Through this rectification, the Red Guards have become more united internally, our organization has become stronger, we have more supporters, and our fighting capacity has become stronger!

The Red Guards are in close unity with revolutionary comrades from all over the country, we are flesh and blood, mutually supportive, and fighting together as class brothers and revolutionary comrades!

The Red Guards are a part of the revolutionary organizations of the world's revolutionary peoples. The revolutionary peoples of the entire nation and the entire world are the strong backing of the Red Guards!

The Red Guards stand tall and firm, striking fear into the hearts of monsters and demons. Shaking the mountains is easy, shaking the Red Guards is difficult!

    撼山易，撼红卫兵难！
    红卫兵是毛泽东思想的忠实卫兵。那些剥削阶级的老爷们嘁嘁喳喳，说这样不好，那样不好，什么“红卫兵脱离群众”啦，“左”倾啦，等等，等等。
    这完全是胡扯！
    红卫兵就要造剥削阶级的反，造一切牛鬼蛇神的反，就是要破“四旧”，立“四新”。红卫兵在这场伟大的文化大革命中闹革命，当然难免会有缺点，有错误，这都是可以批评的。我们对待一切革命群众的善意批评是要虚心接受的。但对于那些剥削阶级老爷们的恶意攻击，就要坚决把它们打回去！
    我们活学活用毛泽东思想，进行了整风。经过整风，红卫兵内部更团结了，组织更坚强了，拥护者更多了，红卫兵战斗力更强了！
    红卫兵同全国各地革命同志心心相印，血肉相连，是互相支援、共同战斗的阶级兄弟，是革命战友！
    红卫兵是世界革命人民革命组织的一个组成部分。全国革命人民，全世界革命人民都是红卫兵的坚强后盾！
    红卫兵顶天立地当中站，牛鬼蛇神心胆寒，撼山易，撼红卫兵难！
