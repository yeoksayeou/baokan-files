Under the control of the literary black line led by Zhou Yang, the *Literary Gazette* of the Chinese Writers' Association and many literary publications have long refused to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, refused to implement the Party's literary policies, and refused to adhere to the literary direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Instead, they have enthusiastically promoted bourgeois literature, revisionist literature, and so-called literature of the 1930s, becoming an important propaganda front for the restoration of capitalism. After the start of the Cultural Revolution, Zhou Yang tightened his control over these publications, fiercely protecting poisonous weeds, setting limits and tones for criticism, and resisting the Cultural Revolution.

In February 1965, the *Literary Gazette* published an article titled "For Whom Is the Dirge Written?" criticizing the anti-Party, anti-socialist historical novels *The Lament of Guangling* and *Tao Yuanming Writes a Dirge*. These two novels are poisonous weeds that viciously attack the Party's leadership, attack the dictatorship of the proletariat, and distort socialist reality. The *Literary Gazette*'s critical article failed to hit the mark and did not touch upon the reactionary essence of these two poisonous weeds. However, even such an article that merely touched on political issues was not spared by Zhou Yang. At a meeting, he vigorously defended the novel's author, claiming that he did not intentionally attack and distort the dictatorship of the proletariat but merely had a "feudal bourgeois dark psychology." If one were to say that he intended to be anti-Party, it would "not fit the actual situation." He also threatened that if the issue of the novels' allegorical criticism were raised, it would "easily lead to speculation and fabricating charges." Zhou Yang not only went to great lengths to defend the novel's author but also instructed his proxy at the *Literary Gazette* to organize a so-called "objective and fair" critical article, even preparing to publish a counter-critical article to exonerate the author of his anti-Party crimes. This plot was later thwarted for some reason. However, Zhou Yang remained obsessed, calling the *Literary Gazette* in April to urge the publication of this article.

This anti-Party veteran, Zhou Yang, is very cunning. He knows that if *The Lament of Guangling* and *Tao Yuanming Writes a Dirge* are named and criticized for allegorical criticism, then the big poisonous weed *Hai Rui's Memorial*, which he vigorously supported and created, would have nowhere to hide; if the author of *Tao Yuanming Writes a Dirge* is exposed, then he, the anti-Party leader who has been spreading poison and protecting poisonous weeds, would not escape the people's judgment. Therefore, he spared no effort to suppress and obstruct the criticism of these two poisonous weeds.

After the start of the Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals rose up to counter the bourgeois offensive. The Zhou Yang clique, fearing the masses' revolution, used their authority and the literary publications they controlled to suppress the workers', peasants', and soldiers' criticism and viciously attack and slander their criticism.

To obstruct criticism, Zhou Yang devised many rules and regulations. He instructed the *Literary Gazette* not to label articles with "political hats," to "strictly separate academic issues from political issues," to "argue purely on academic grounds," or to "not label them as anti-Party and anti-socialist," and so on. He attempted to use these rules and regulations to bind the hands and feet of the revolutionary masses and cancel the proletariat's struggle against anti-Party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds.

Starting in the second half of 1964, many newspapers and magazines across the country published critical articles. Under the revolutionary pressure from the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, the *Literary Gazette* had to publish a few "critical" articles that were harmless. At the same time, it opened a "Readers' Forum" column to dress up its image, selecting and publishing some less sharp critical letters after editing. Zhou Yang's revolutionary class instincts were very sensitive. He feared that one day the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers would dig up his big poisonous root, so he personally intervened in the publication of workers', peasants', and soldiers' critical articles by newspapers and magazines. He publicly declared that workers', peasants', and soldiers' comments "must prevent one-sidedness." He was very dissatisfied with the workers', peasants', and soldiers' criticism of the films *Early Spring in February* and *Lin's Shop*, saying that it was arbitrary to believe that Xiao Jieqiu could not possibly take the revolutionary road; he also said that Lin Laoban was a small capitalist, and it was a fact that Lin Laoban was exploited and oppressed. Lin Mo Han followed up by saying that workers', peasants', and soldiers' comments had "limitations," and the work of criticism "could not be left to workers, peasants, and soldiers." He even viciously cursed that emphasizing workers', peasants', and soldiers' comments would lead to the "error" of the "poor peasant line." Their black words, in essence, were against the workers', peasants', and soldiers' masses participating in the Cultural Revolution. They were terrified of the workers', peasants', and soldiers' masses rising up to overthrow them.

Due to the Zhou Yang clique's suppression, the *Literary Gazette* suddenly hit the brakes in March 1965, returning a large number of critical manuscripts and fiercely suppressing and attacking the correct criticisms of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionary things, you don't beat them, they won't fall." We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and, riding on the momentum of victory, completely overthrow the literary black clique led by Zhou Yang!

    不让群魔有藏身之地
    ——选自中国作家协会的大字报
    在以周扬为首的文艺黑线的控制下，中国作家协会的《文艺报》和许多文艺刊物，长期以来拒不宣传毛泽东思想，拒不执行党的文艺政策，拒不贯彻文艺的工农兵方向。相反，它们却狂热地宣扬资产阶级文艺、修正主义文艺和所谓三十年代文艺，成为复辟资本主义的重要宣传阵地。文化大革命开始以后，周扬对这些刊物控制得更紧，百般保护毒草，给批判定范围、定调子，抗拒文化大革命。
    《文艺报》一九六五年二月，发表了一篇《为谁写挽歌？》，批判反党反社会主义的历史小说《广陵散》和《陶渊明写〈挽歌〉》。《广陵散》和《陶渊明写〈挽歌〉》，是疯狂攻击党的领导，攻击无产阶级专政，丑化社会主义现实的两棵大毒草。《文艺报》的这篇批判文章，远远没有击中要害，没有接触到两棵毒草的反动实质。但是，就连这样一篇仅仅涉及一点政治问题的批判文章，周扬也不放过。在一次会上，他竭力为小说作者开脱罪责，说他不是有意攻击和丑化无产阶级专政，只不过是“封建资产阶级的阴暗心理”，如果“说他就是要反党”，那就“不符合实际情况”。他还气势汹汹地威胁说，如果批判反动历史小说的“影射问题”，就“很容易产生推测，罗织（罪名）”。周扬不仅挖空心思为小说作者开脱，还指示他在《文艺报》的代理人，组织了一篇所谓“实事求是”、“平等态度”的“批评”文章，甚至准备发表一篇对《为谁写挽歌？》的反批评文章，为小说作者洗刷反党罪名。这个阴谋后来因故未能得逞。但是，周扬仍然念念不忘，四月份又打电话给《文艺报》，催促刊登这篇文章。
    周扬这个反党老手，狡猾得很。他懂得《广陵散》、《陶渊明写〈挽歌〉》如果被点名批判为影射现实，那么他大力支持和炮制的大毒草《海瑞上疏》就更无处藏身了；如果《陶渊明写〈挽歌〉》的作者被揪出来，那么他这个大肆放毒、大肆支持和保护毒草的反党头目更逃不过人民的审判了。因此，他千方百计压制和阻挠对这两棵毒草的批判。
    无产阶级文化大革命开始以后，广大工农兵、革命干部和革命知识分子对资产阶级的进攻奋起反击。周扬黑帮害怕群众起来革命，他们利用职权，利用他们控制的文艺刊物，百般压制工农兵的批判，并对工农兵的批判进行恶毒的攻击和诬蔑。
    为了阻挠批判，周扬想方设法订出了许多清规戒律。他指示《文艺报》在批判文章中，不要扣“政治帽子”，“学术问题要与政治问题严格分开”，“完全凭学术本身讲道理”，“或者根本不扣反党反社会主义的帽子”，等等。他妄想用这些清规戒律，束缚住广大革命群众的手脚，取消无产阶级对反党反社会主义毒草所进行的斗争。
    一九六四年下半年起，全国许多报刊都刊登了一些批判文章，《文艺报》迫于工农兵群众的革命压力，不得不发表几篇伤皮不伤肉的“批判”文章；同时开辟了“读者论坛”这个栏目，装潢门面，选一些批判不十分尖锐的来稿，删削之后发表。周扬的反革命阶级嗅觉十分灵敏，他惧怕工农兵群众有朝一日会挖到他这条大毒根上来，因此亲自出马干涉报刊发表工农兵的批判文章。他公开叫嚷：对工农兵的评论“要防止片面性”。他对工农兵群众批判电影《早春二月》、《林家铺子》极为不满，说什么认为萧涧秋根本不可能走上革命道路是武断的批评；又说林老板是小资本家，不能说林老板受剥削、受压迫不是事实。林默涵接着补充说：工农兵评论有“局限性”，评论工作“不能躺在工农兵身上”。甚至恶狠狠地骂道：重视工农兵评论，就要犯“贫雇农路线”的“错误”。他们的这些黑话，说穿了，就是反对工农兵群众参加文化大革命。他们对工农兵群众起来革他们的命，简直怕得要死。
    由于周扬黑帮的百般压制，《文艺报》从一九六五年三月开始，突然来了一个大“刹车”。大批地退掉批判稿件，疯狂地压制和打击广大工农兵群众的正确批评。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”我们一定要按照毛主席的教导，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，乘胜追击，把以周扬为首的文艺黑帮统统打倒！
