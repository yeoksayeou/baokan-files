    At the reception celebrating the anniversary of the founding of the PLA held at the Chinese Embassy in Albania, Baluku said that the PLA's participation in the Cultural Revolution has great historical significance.

    Li Yifan praises the Albanian People's Army for setting a brilliant example in the militarization of the revolution.

    According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Tirana on July 31, Chinese military attaché Li Yifan held a reception at the Chinese Embassy in Albania on the evening of July 31 to celebrate the 39th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

    Guests invited to the reception included: Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour, Vice Premier and Minister of Defense Bekir Baluku, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and Minister of Interior Kadri Hazbiu, Minister of Trade Qico Ngjela, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Rexhep Malile, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the People's Army Dilaiver Poci, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the People's Army Vasko Kino, and more than 100 party and government leaders and people from various circles in Tirana.

    The acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Albania, Wang Jinchuan, and diplomatic envoys from some countries to Albania also attended the reception. Li Yifan and Baluku both spoke at the reception.

    Baluku, speaking about China's Cultural Revolution, said, "Following the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong, the working masses and the military have actively participated in the socialist cultural revolution. This not only has great historical significance for China but also for the fate of socialism and revolution on an international scale." Baluku then discussed the foreign policy of the People's Republic of China. He said: "The People's Republic of China firmly and unshakably supports the life-and-death struggle of the heroic Vietnamese people to smash and expel the American aggressors; the People's Republic of China stands at the forefront of defending the Marxist-Leninist unity of the international communist and workers' movements, striving for the victory of socialism and revolution, and fighting against modern revisionism. The conspiracy and propaganda of the lackeys and servants of American imperialism, the Khrushchev revisionists, to make the Vietnamese people surrender through 'peace talks' will forever fail. The recent statements by the Chinese government leaders supporting the just struggle of the Vietnamese people to thoroughly defeat the American aggressors, and the demonstrations by the Chinese people, are another sublime example of proletarian internationalism, which has been warmly supported by the people of various countries."

    Baluku warmly praised the great achievements of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in all aspects. He said, "Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese People's Liberation Army is an invincible modernized army. The Chinese People's Liberation Army implements the Party's line and the Marxist-Leninist thoughts of Comrade Mao Zedong, emphasizes politics, practices the mass line of the three great democracies, actively participates in production and construction, and thus becomes very powerful, becoming a strong defender of the peace of China's borders, Asia, and the world."

    Baluku finally enthusiastically praised the fighting friendship and unbreakable unity between the peoples and armies of the two countries. He said, "The fighting friendship and unbreakable unity between the peoples and armies of the two countries, forged by our two Marxist-Leninist parties and our dear leaders Enver Hoxha and Mao Zedong, is a brilliant example of proletarian internationalism. This friendship will be increasingly consolidated and developed."

    Li Yifan said, "The Albanian People's Army insists on the revolutionary line of militarization, which not only has profound significance for defending its own socialist motherland and safeguarding the peace of Europe and the world, but also sets a brilliant example for socialist countries in the militarization of the army."

    Li Yifan finally praised the great fighting friendship and unity between the peoples and armies of the two countries.

    中国解放军参加文化大革命有重大历史意义
    李一凡赞扬阿人民军为军队革命化树立了光辉榜样
    据新华社地拉那一日电　中国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使馆武官李一凡七月三十一日晚上在使馆举行酒会，热烈庆祝中国人民解放军建军三十九周年。
    应邀出席酒会的有：阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议副主席兼国防部长贝基尔·巴卢库，党中央政治局候补委员、内务部长卡德里·哈兹比乌，贸易部长基乔·恩杰拉，外交部副部长雷兹·马利列，人民军政治部副主任迪拉维尔·波奇，人民军副总参谋长瓦斯克·基诺，以及地拉那市的党政领导人和各界人士等一百多人。
    中国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使馆临时代办王锦川和一些国家驻阿尔巴尼亚的外交使节也出席了酒会。李一凡和巴卢库在酒会上先后发表了讲话。
    巴卢库在谈到中国的文化大革命时说，按照毛泽东同志的教导，劳动群众和军队积极参加了社会主义文化大革命。这不仅对中国，而且对国际范围内的社会主义和革命的命运具有重大的历史意义。巴卢库接着谈到了中华人民共和国的对外政策。他说：“人民中国毫不动摇地坚决支持英雄的越南人民生死攸关的斗争、粉碎和驱逐美国侵略者的斗争；人民中国站在保卫国际共产主义运动和工人运动的马克思列宁主义团结、争取社会主义和革命的胜利以及反对现代修正主义的斗争的最前列。美帝国主义的帮凶和仆从赫鲁晓夫修正主义者企图通过‘和谈’使越南人民屈服的阴谋和蛊惑宣传，将永远归于失败。中国政府领导人最近关于支持越南人民的正义斗争、彻底打败美国侵略者的声明和中国人民的游行示威，是无产阶级国际主义的又一崇高榜样，得到各国人民的热烈支持。”
    巴卢库热烈赞扬中国人民解放军在各个方面所取得的伟大成就。他说，在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党领导下的中国人民解放军，是一支不可战胜的现代化军队。中国人民解放军贯彻执行党的路线和毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义思想，突出政治，实行三大民主的群众路线，积极参加生产建设，从而变得十分强大，成为中国边疆、亚洲和世界和平的坚强保卫者。
    巴卢库最后热情赞扬了阿中两国人民和军队的战斗友谊和牢不可破的团结。他说，由我们两个马克思列宁主义政党和亲爱的领袖恩维尔·霍查同志、毛泽东同志锤炼起来的阿中两国人民和军队之间战斗友谊和牢不可破的团结，是无产阶级国际主义的光辉典范，这种友谊将日益得到巩固和发展。
    李一凡说，阿尔巴尼亚人民军坚持革命化建军路线，不仅对保卫自己的社会主义祖国、保卫欧洲和世界和平有着深远的意义，而且为社会主义国家在军队革命化建设上，树立了一个光辉榜样。
    李一凡最后赞扬了中、阿两国人民，两国军队的伟大的战斗友谊和团结。
