On the evening of August 8, we listened to the Party Central Committee's decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution with extraordinary excitement and joy.

This is a brilliant and great decision, a document of great historical and present significance. It marks the beginning of a new chapter in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

We enthusiastically shout: Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live Chairman Mao!

We are all young people who have grown up under the red flag. The sharp and complex class struggles of the past two months have deeply educated and tempered us, teaching us many revolutionary skills. In this unprecedented class struggle, we indeed feel that the resistance is great and the difficulties are many. However, as the Central Committee's decision says: "It will temper the proletariat and other working people, especially the younger generation, providing them with experience and lessons, making them understand that the revolutionary road is tortuous and not smooth." We have the powerful ideological weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, so we dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to venture, and dare to make revolution! Even if the road ahead is filled with storms and reefs; even if we make this or that mistake, and face setbacks and failures time and time again, we are not afraid! All of this will only make us stronger. For the cause of the Party, we are willing to risk everything. Without the revolutionary spirit of daring to make revolution, daring to struggle, and daring to win, we would betray Chairman Mao's teachings and would not be worthy of being proletarian revolutionaries!

For the victory of this Cultural Revolution, we will resolutely follow the direction indicated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, charging into the enemy's ranks and fighting to the end, even if it means climbing mountains of knives and crossing seas of fire, we will not hesitate.

With the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought illuminating the path of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we will surely achieve complete and thorough victory!

　　在阶级斗争风浪中我们将越战越强
    八月八日晚上，我们怀着异常激动和喜悦的心情，听到了党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定。
    这是一个光辉伟大的决定，是具有现实意义和历史意义的文献，它揭开了无产阶级文化大革命的崭新的一页。
    我们热烈地欢呼：中国共产党万岁！毛主席万岁！
    我们都是一些毛头青年，是在红旗下长大的。两个多月来的尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，深深地教育了我们，锻炼了我们，使我们学到了许多革命的本领。在这场史无前例的阶级斗争中，我们也的确感到阻力是很大的，困难是很多的。但是，正如中央决定中所说：“它将使无产阶级和其他劳动群众，特别是年青一代，得到锻炼，取得经验教训，懂得革命的道路是曲折的，不平坦的。”我们有毛泽东思想这一强大思想武器，我们就敢想、敢说、敢做、敢闯、敢革命！即使前进道路上会掀起狂风恶浪，会布满险滩暗礁；尽管我们会出现这样或那样的错误，会遭到一次又一次的挫折和失败，但是，我们都不怕！这一切只会把我们磨炼得更坚强。为了党的事业，我们把一切都豁出去了，没有敢于革命、敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命精神，我们就辜负了毛主席对我们的教导，就不配做一个无产阶级的革命者！
    为了这场文化大革命的胜利，我们坚决按照党中央和毛主席指引的方向，冲锋陷阵，革命到底，就是上刀山，下火海，也在所不辞。
    有毛泽东思想的阳光照亮着无产阶级文化大革命的道路，我们必将取得完全彻底的胜利！
