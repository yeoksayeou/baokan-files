31 Million Military and Civilians Rise to Battle, Severely Punishing the U.S. Imperialists

The U.S. Imperialists' War Blackmail and Peace Talks Fraud Meet with Bankruptcy

According to the New China News Agency in Hanoi on the 2nd, the Vietnam People's Army Newspaper published a commentary on the 1st of August, which pointed out: Under the great battle call of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the 31 million military and civilians of Vietnam have risen up unanimously, bravely charging into the enemy's ranks, and achieved brilliant victories in the battles of July.

The commentary evaluating the situation in Vietnam in July said that in July, the situation in South and North Vietnam has undergone many new changes. The U.S. imperialists, in their desperate struggles, have failed more miserably; the entire military and civilian population of Vietnam, with deep hatred, firm resolve, and conviction, have responded to Chairman Ho's sacred call, rising up to fight, fighting more and more victoriously.

The commentary then discussed how the U.S. imperialists, in order to salvage their heavy defeats in South Vietnam, have again carried out extremely serious new "escalations" in their destructive war. The commentary said, "The higher they climb, the harder they fall."

The commentary said, "Since the beginning of the year, July has been the month with the most U.S. planes shot down, one of the months with the most U.S. pilots captured alive, the month with the highest proportion of enemy planes shot down on the spot, and the month with the most enemy planes shot down at night."

The commentary said that in July this year, North Vietnam called, and South Vietnam responded. On the great front of the motherland, the military and civilians of South Vietnam also timely gave severe punishment to the U.S. bandits who committed new crimes of "escalation." The U.S. "emergency plan" in the rainy season is meeting with failure. The main arterial railways and Highway No. 1 have practically become dead ends. The U.S. so-called "annihilation tactics" have also been proactively annihilated by the liberation armed forces.

The commentary pointed out that the guerrilla forces in the South have also coordinated with the major battles of the liberation army, tightening the encirclement to annihilate the Americans, and fiercely attacking the enemy's rear bases. Even the defensive lines of the gates of Saigon have been seriously threatened, sometimes more than ten outposts and sentry posts are simultaneously attacked in one night.

The commentary said that Chairman Ho's sacred call and mobilization have brought new vitality to the Vietnamese people. The entire military and civilian population of Vietnam, with actual actions, with fierce offensives and magnificent achievements, have shattered the foolish illusions of the Washington authorities, who thought they could force the Vietnamese people to the negotiating table with bombs and cruel destruction, accepting their bandit conditions.

The commentary pointed out that the U.S. new war "escalation" has been shattered. It has not only suffered a miserable military defeat but has also been unprecedentedly isolated politically. The U.S. war blackmail and "peace talks" fraud have both completely bankrupted.

    越南《人民军队报》欢呼七月份抗美救国斗争辉煌胜利
    三千一百万军民奋起战斗严惩美帝
    美帝战争讹诈与和谈骗局遭到破产
    据新华社河内二日电　越南《人民军队报》八月一日在一篇评论中指出：在胡志明主席的伟大战斗号召鼓舞下，越南三千一百万军民一致奋起，英勇地向敌人冲锋陷阵，在七月份的战斗中取得了辉煌的胜利。
    这篇评述七月份越南战局的评论说，在七月份中，越南南方和北方的战局有了许多新的变化，美帝国主义在绝望的挣扎中失败得越来越惨；越南全国军民以深刻的仇恨，坚定的决心和信念，响应胡主席的神圣号召，奋起战斗，越战越胜。
    评论接着谈到美帝国主义为了挽救它在越南南方遭到的惨重失败，在破坏性战争中又进行了极其严重的新“升级”。评论说，但是它爬得越高，就摔得越痛。
    评论说，“从年初以来，七月份是美国飞机被打落最多的一个月，是我们军民活捉美国飞行员最多的月份之一，是当场被打落的敌机的比例数字最高的一个月，是夜间打落的敌机最多的一个月。”
    评论说，在今年七月份中，越南北方召唤，越南南方响应。在祖国的大前线上，越南南方军民也及时地给予犯下新的战争“升级”罪行的美国强盗以严厉的惩罚。美国在雨季中的“紧急计划”正在遭到失败。主要的大动脉铁路和一号公路实际上已经成了死路。美国的所谓“粉碎战术”也被解放武装力量主动地粉碎了。
    评论指出，南方游击队还配合解放军的大战斗，缩紧歼美包围圈，猛烈袭击敌人的后方基地。就是西贡门户的防线，也遭到严重的威胁，有时候一个夜晚就有上十个据点和哨所同时遭到袭击。
    评论说，胡主席发出的神圣号召和动员给越南人民带来了新的活力。越南全国军民以实际的行动，以猛烈的攻势和显赫的战果，粉碎了华盛顿当局的愚蠢幻想，它们以为可以用炸弹和残酷的破坏，迫使越南人民走向会议桌，接受它们的强盗条件。
    评论指出，美国的新战争“升级”已被粉碎，它不但在军事上遭到惨败，而且在政治上也空前地孤立。美国的战争讹诈和“和平谈判”骗局都已彻底破产。
