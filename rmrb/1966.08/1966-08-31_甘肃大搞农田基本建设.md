Gansu Province is vigorously carrying out agricultural land construction. Farmers in Gansu are actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, and have achieved significant results in agricultural land construction.

Since last winter, the entire province has built 600,000 mu of new terraced fields, which is equivalent to half of the total area of terraced fields built over the past sixteen years. At the same time, the province has completed 5,100 irrigation canals, dug 13,000 wells, and excavated 44,900 springs, expanding the effective irrigated area by 467,000 mu. The province has also covered 200,000 mu of sandy fields. These projects played a significant role in combating the severe drought this year.

    甘肃大搞农田基本建设
    甘肃农民活学活用毛主席著作，发扬自力更生的革命精神，大搞农田基本建设，取得了很大的成绩。
    全省从去年冬天到现在，新修水平梯田六十多万亩，相当于过去十六年所修的水平梯田总面积的一半。同时，这个省还修好灌溉渠道五千一百多条，打成水井一万三千多眼，掏挖泉水四万四千九百多处，共扩大有效灌溉面积四十六万七千多亩。全省还铺压砂田二十万亩。这些工程在今年抗御严重干旱的斗争中发挥了显著的作用。
