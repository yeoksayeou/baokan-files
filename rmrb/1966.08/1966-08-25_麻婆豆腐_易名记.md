In Beijing, and across the nation, "Mapo Tofu" is almost universally known. This famous dish originates from the "Chen Mapo Tofu" restaurant in Chengdu, but many people may not know the details.

On the morning of August 23, just after the Central People's Broadcasting Station announced that the Red Guards in Beijing were launching a major attack on the remnants of bourgeois and feudal forces, changing the names of some streets and shops in the capital, a reporter happened to pass by the "Chen Mapo Tofu" restaurant on Yulong Street in Chengdu. Several workers were seen with knives, standing on ladders, scraping off the characters "Chen Mapo." Entering the dining hall, one could see that the signs with the names of "famous people" and the "introduction" boards of "Chen Mapo Tofu" had been taken down and thrown into the corner of the wall. "Do you have 'Mapo Tofu'?" I asked. "We only have 'Spicy Tofu,'" a female server replied. "The name was changed this morning!"

The person in charge of the restaurant told me that the incident happened that morning: The workers were studying the Sixteen Points, and someone suggested, "Chen Mapo is a capitalist. How can we use this vulgar and shabby sign to serve the people?" He proposed taking down the "Chen Mapo Tofu" sign and chopping it up for firewood. At that time, someone hesitated, saying, "If we change the name, will it affect our sales?" This remark was immediately refuted by the young worker Yao Liyuan: "The tofu is promoted by us workers, and the dish is made by us workers. Why do we need to rely on a capitalist's sign to make money?" A simple sentence moved the hearts of more than thirty workers. Everyone suggested: Immediately take down the old sign and scrape off the words on the wall.

The old sign of "Chen Mapo Tofu" was taken down. What will this restaurant be called in the future? Someone suggested: Since we are on Yulong Street, let's call it the "Yulong" restaurant. Someone disagreed, saying, "The characters 'Yulong' also carry feudal ideology." Someone suggested, "This name change is a victory of the Cultural Revolution, so let's call it the 'Wen Sheng' restaurant...".

The storm of the Cultural Revolution is sweeping across every corner of the nation, including this restaurant with a history of more than a hundred years.

    “麻婆豆腐”易名记
    在北京、在全国，“麻婆豆腐”几乎是人所共知的菜。这道名菜出于成都“陈麻婆豆腐”饭店，恐怕很多人是不知底细的。
    八月二十三日中午，也就是中央人民广播电台广播北京红卫兵向资产阶级、封建主义残余势力大举攻击，改换首都一些街名、商店名称的消息后，记者正好路过成都玉龙街上的“陈麻婆豆腐”饭店。只见几位工人正拿着菜刀，站在梯子上刮去“陈麻婆”三个字。走进饭堂，看见那些由“名人”题字的“陈麻婆豆腐”的匾额和“简介”牌，也被取下来扔在墙角角里。“有‘麻婆豆腐’吗？”我问。“只有‘麻辣豆腐’，今天上午改了名！”一位女服务员回答。
    这个饭店的负责同志告诉我，事情发生在当天上午：职工们学习十六条，有人提出“陈麻婆”是个资本家，我们怎么能打着这个庸俗、鄙陋的招牌为人民服务呢？他建议把“陈麻婆豆腐”的招牌取下来砍了当柴烧。当时有人表示犹豫，说：“改了名，是不是会影响卖钱呵！”这话立即受到青年工人姚立元的反驳：“豆腐是我们工人推出来的，菜是我们工人做出来的，为什么要靠资本家的招牌来卖钱？”简简单单一句话，打动了三十多位职工的心。大家建议：立即取下旧招牌，刮掉墙上的字。
    “陈麻婆豆腐”的旧招牌被拿下来了。这个饭馆今后改叫什么名字呢？有人说：我们在玉龙街上，就叫“玉龙”饭店吧。有人不同意，说“玉龙”这两个字也带有封建思想。有人说，这次改名是文化大革命的胜利，就叫“文胜”饭店吧。……
    无产阶级文化大革命的风暴冲击着全国每一个角落，也包括这家有一百多年历史的饭馆。
