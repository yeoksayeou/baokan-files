Chairman Mao loves the working people

On the morning of the 18th, the capital was to hold a rally of a million people to celebrate the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. I was overjoyed to hear that Chairman Mao would attend this rally. I was so excited that I couldn't sleep well. After midnight, I only dozed off for a while in the car. I woke up at around three in the morning and was too excited to sleep anymore.

I drove to the back of Tiananmen Square and arrived at 6:15 AM. I thought: If I came this early, I would definitely be able to see Chairman Mao. But at this time, the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" had already filled Tiananmen Square. It turned out that Chairman Mao had come to the crowd at 5 AM. Our beloved leader, Chairman Mao, cares so much about the people and the Cultural Revolution!

I looked out through the gate and saw a sea of people, with red flags waving and a festive atmosphere. The people on the square were shouting, singing, and jumping with great excitement. The wish of a million people was realized: they saw their beloved leader, Chairman Mao! Everyone's words turned into one voice: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!

After the parade began, my heart became even more excited. I thought: Chairman Mao came early, he would quickly come down from the city gate and rest early, then I could see Chairman Mao. But I waited until almost noon and still did not see Chairman Mao come down.

Around noon, Chairman Mao came down from the city gate! We, several dozen drivers, ran towards Chairman Mao shouting with joy. Chairman Mao's tall figure, dressed in a green military uniform, wearing a red star military cap, the badge shining brightly, his face ruddy and kind. Seeing our beloved leader so healthy made my heart warm. I thought: Chairman Mao, your health is the happiness of all the people in China and the world! I wish you eternal life!

Chairman Mao saw us and did not get into his car, but walked towards us. This made us so happy, and we all shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" and clapped enthusiastically. Chairman Mao waved to us, walked around us, and then got into the car. As the car moved, Chairman Mao was still waving to us. I felt so happy, I didn't know how to express it.

Our great leader was on Tiananmen Square for six or seven hours, which was already tiring enough, but he still met with us ordinary drivers, showing such concern and love for us. Only our Chairman Mao has such a close relationship with the working people, and only our Chairman Mao has such class feelings for the working people. I will never forget this day. I will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words, read Chairman Mao's books, and work for the revolution for life.

### 毛主席最爱劳动人民

　　毛主席最爱劳动人民
    十八日早晨七点钟，首都要开百万人大会，庆祝无产阶级文化大革命。听说毛主席要参加这个大会，我高兴极了，连觉都没有好好睡。夜里十二点以后，我只在车上眯了一会，三点多醒来，兴奋得就再也睡不着了。
    我开车来到天安门背后，是六点十五分。心想：来的这么早，一定能看到毛主席。可是，这时候天安门上下，“毛主席万岁”的欢呼声已经响成一片。原来，毛主席在早晨五点钟就来到群众中间了。我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席多么关心群众，多么关心文化大革命呀！
    我透过城门洞往外看，人山人海，红旗招展，一片欢腾。广场上的人们喊着、唱着、跳着，万分激动。百万人一个共同的愿望实现了：见到了敬爱的领袖毛主席！人们的千言万语变成了一个声音：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    游行开始以后，我的心更加激动了。我想：毛主席来的很早，他会很快地从城楼下来，早点回去休息，我就可以看到毛主席了。可是，一直等到快十二点了，还没有见到毛主席下来。
    十二点多，毛主席从城楼下来了！我们几十个汽车司机同志，欢呼着向毛主席跑去。毛主席魁梧的身材，穿着草绿色的军装，戴着红五星军帽，帽徽闪闪发光，面孔红润而慈祥。看到敬爱的领袖这样健康，我的心里热呼呼的。我心里想：毛主席呀，您的健康就是全国人民、全世界人民的幸福呵！祝您万寿无疆！
    毛主席看到了我们，没有走进他的车里去，却向我们走来了。这可把我们乐坏了，大家齐声高呼“毛主席万岁！”使劲地鼓掌。毛主席向我们招手，围着我们绕了一圈，然后才进到车里去。车子开动了，毛主席还在向我们招手。我感到太幸福了，高兴得不知怎样才好。
    我们的伟大领袖在天安门上下活动了六七个小时，已经够累了，最后还和我们这些普通的司机见面，这样关心我们，热爱劳动人民。只有我们的毛主席和劳动人民才有这样的亲密关系，只有我们的毛主席对劳动人民才有这样的阶级感情。我这一辈子都忘不了这一天。我一定听毛主席的话，读毛主席的书，干一辈子革命。
