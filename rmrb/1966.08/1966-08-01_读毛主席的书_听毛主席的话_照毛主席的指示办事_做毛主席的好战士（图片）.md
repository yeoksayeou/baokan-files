The People's Liberation Army is a revolutionary army armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao's books are the soldiers' favorites to read; Chairman Mao's words are the soldiers' favorites to listen to. Soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force. The picture shows soldiers of a certain platoon studying Chairman Mao's quotations during a rest period on a march.

Propagating Mao Zedong Thought to the masses at all times and in all places, and helping militia members with political and military training, are the glorious tasks of our army. The picture shows Huang Zu Shi (center), an active member in studying Chairman Mao's works and a deputy political instructor of a certain unit of the Guangzhou Military Region, guiding militia members in actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's war in Lunjiao Commune, Shunde County, Guangdong Province.

"Never forget class struggle." Chairman Mao's great call has enlightened the eyes of the broad masses of soldiers and inspired them to temper themselves in the great storms of class struggle. During the tumultuous Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the soldiers and officers of a certain platoon of the Third Company, with strong class feelings, condemned and criticized the bourgeoisie with pen and mouth.

"Stand firmly with the Chinese people and serve them wholeheartedly—this is the sole purpose of this army." The border defense troops stationed in the Ali region of Tibet remember Chairman Mao's teachings. They fear neither the wind and snow nor the high-altitude lack of oxygen, and guard the highlands at an altitude of around 5,000 meters, completing the glorious task of defending the country's borders.

Revolutionary war is a war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, and only by relying on the masses can we wage war. The Ninth Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, following Chairman Mao's instructions, actively helps the militia on the Jiaodong Peninsula to study Chairman Mao's works and train in military skills, jointly guarding the coastal defense.

Build the country and the army with thrift. The soldiers of a certain repair platoon of the Nanjing Military Region's island unit draw endless courage and strength from Chairman Mao's works. They carry forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, build their own equipment, make their own tools, and rely on their own strength to overcome difficulties. The picture shows soldiers casting.

The People's Liberation Army is always a fighting force, a working force, and a productive force. Look, the seedlings cultivated by the soldiers and officers of a certain unit are so uniform and vigorous!

    读毛主席的书  听毛主席的话
    照毛主席的指示办事  做毛主席的好战士
    人民解放军是一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命军队。毛主席的书，战士最爱读；毛主席的话，战士最爱听；毛泽东思想武装起来的战士，是最大的战斗力。图为某连战士在行军途中，抓紧休息时间学习毛主席语录。
    随时随地向广大群众宣传毛泽东思想，帮助民兵进行政治和军事训练，这是我军的光荣任务。图为学习毛主席著作积极分子、人民解放军广州部队某部副指导员黄祖示（中），在广东顺德县伦教公社辅导民兵活学活用毛主席关于人民战争的思想。
    “千万不要忘记阶级斗争”。毛主席的伟大号召，擦亮了广大战士的眼睛，鼓舞着他们到阶级斗争的大风大浪里去锻炼。在轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命中，某部三连指战员怀着强烈的阶级感情，口诛笔伐，积极批判资产阶级。
    “紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”驻守在西藏阿里地区的边防部队，牢记着毛主席的教导，他们不畏风雪严寒，不怕高山缺氧，坚守在海拔五千米左右的高原，出色地完成了捍卫祖国边疆的光荣任务。
    革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。人民解放军某部九连按照毛主席的指示，积极帮助胶东半岛的民兵学习毛主席著作，训练军事技术，共同严守海防。
    勤俭建国，勤俭建军。人民解放军南京部队某海岛修理连的战士，从毛主席著作中汲取了无限的勇气和力量。他们发扬自力更生的革命精神，自建设备，自造工具，依靠自己的力量克服困难。图为战士在翻砂。
    人民解放军永远是一支战斗队，又是一支工作队，又是一支生产队。看，某部指战员培育的秧苗，多么匀整、茁壮！
