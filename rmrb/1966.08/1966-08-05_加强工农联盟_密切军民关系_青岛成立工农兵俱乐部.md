A new type of club aimed at strengthening the worker-peasant alliance and fostering military-civilian relations—the Qingdao Shuiqinggou Worker-Peasant-Soldier Club—was officially established yesterday and opened to the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

This worker-peasant-soldier club was jointly organized by the Qingdao municipal trade union, the local garrison, and the suburban people's commune, based on Chairman Mao's teachings on the worker-peasant alliance and class struggle.

On the evening of the 2nd, an opening ceremony was held at the Shuiqinggou Worker-Peasant-Soldier Club theater. Over 2,000 workers, peasants, and soldiers gathered to exchange their experiences and insights from studying Chairman Mao's works, view an exhibition of Liu Yingjun's paintings, listen to stories about Ou Yanghai, sing revolutionary songs, and participate in a basketball match.

Prior to this, Qufu and Jiaozhou counties in Shandong Province had also established worker-peasant-soldier clubs.

    据新华社青岛二日电　一个以加强工农联盟和密切军民关系为目的的新型俱乐部——青岛市水清沟工农兵俱乐部，昨天正式成立，向广大工农兵开放。
    这个工农兵俱乐部，是青岛市工会组织根据毛主席关于工农联盟、阶级和阶级斗争的教导，和当地驻军、郊区人民公社共同筹办的。
    一日晚，在水清沟工农兵俱乐部剧场举行了开幕仪式。二千多名工农兵群众欢聚在一起，交流学习毛主席著作的心得和经验，参观介绍刘英俊的画展，听关于欧阳海的故事，还进行了演唱革命歌曲、举行篮球赛等活动。
    在这之前，山东省的曲阜县和胶县也先后成立了工农兵俱乐部。
