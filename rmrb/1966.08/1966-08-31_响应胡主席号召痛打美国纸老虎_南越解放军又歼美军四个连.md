	Responding to Chairman Hu's great call to arms, the liberation forces in the provinces of Quang Tri and Thua Thien in South Vietnam launched a series of attacks against the enemy from August 17 to 26. They annihilated six enemy companies, two platoons, and one battalion command post, including four companies of U.S. troops.

	The liberation forces in these two provinces also inflicted heavy losses on two puppet army companies, destroyed several cannons, seven tanks, and many military vehicles, and captured a large quantity of weapons.

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on August 29, the liberation forces in South Vietnam have recently intensified their attacks on the enemy's water supply lines. In the past three days alone, they have sunk two enemy ships and damaged one in the main waterways near Saigon.

	According to Western news agencies, on August 27, the liberation forces sank a South Vietnamese puppet navy landing ship in a river about 90 kilometers southwest of Saigon. On August 28, they sank an enemy minesweeper in the Saigon River about 30 kilometers southeast of Saigon. On August 29, another enemy minesweeper was damaged in the Saigon River.

	Just less than a week ago, a U.S. invasion force's 10,000-ton military cargo ship was sunk by mines laid by the liberation forces in the Saigon River on August 23.

	Additionally, it was reported that on August 28, the liberation forces once again bombarded the Long Binh Air Base, located about 100 kilometers southwest of Saigon. According to the Associated Press, several helicopters were destroyed. This was the third time the liberation forces had attacked this air base, which is used by U.S. planes in the Mekong Delta region since May 29 of this year.

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on August 30, the Vietnamese newspaper "People's Army" published a commentary on August 29, enthusiastically praising the recent victories of the military and people of South Vietnam in the past month, where they have struck eight times against the U.S. invaders at places such as the Noi Bai Air Base, Soc Trang Air Base, Tan Son Nhut Air Base, and the Dong Nai River area in the ancient city of Hue.

	The commentary pointed out that in the comparison of enemy and friendly forces, the South Vietnamese military and people have many fundamental advantages, while the enemy has many fundamental weaknesses. The enemy's relatively important advantage lies in material and technological equipment. Attacking the enemy's concentrated areas of combat tools and technical equipment not only limits and eliminates the enemy's advantage but also deepens the enemy's weaknesses and difficulties.

    响应胡主席号召痛打美国纸老虎
    南越解放军又歼美军四个连
    新华社河内二十九日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方广治、承天两省解放武装力量，响应胡主席的伟大战斗号召，从八月十七日到二十六日，接连向敌人发起进攻，共歼灭敌人六个连、两个排和一个营指挥所，其中包括四个连的美军。
    这两省的解放武装力量还重创伪军两个连，击毁大炮多门，坦克七辆和军车多辆，缴获大批武器。
    据新华社二十九日讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放武装力量最近三天在西贡附近的主要河道上接连炸沉敌人军舰两艘，炸伤一艘。
    据西方通讯社报道，解放武装力量二十七日在西贡西南约九十公里的河上炸沉了南越伪海军的一艘登陆艇。二十八日在西贡东南约三十公里的西贡河上又炸沉了敌军一艘扫雷艇。二十九日，敌军的另一艘扫雷艇又在西贡河上被炸伤。
    解放武装力量最近加强了对敌人水上交通线的袭击。仅仅在不到一周以前，美国侵略军的一艘万吨军用货船，二十三日在西贡河上被解放武装力量敷设的水雷炸沉。
    另据报道，解放武装力量二十八日又一次炮轰了西贡西南一百多公里的永隆机场。据美联社透露，一些直升飞机被击毁。这是解放武装力量从今年五月二十九日以来第三次袭击这个供湄公河三角洲地区美国飞机使用的机场。
    据新华社河内三十日电　越南《人民军队报》二十九日发表评论，热烈赞扬越南南方军民近一个月来接连八次痛击诺曼机场、朔庄机场、新山一机场和古芝县东如地区等地的美国侵略军的新胜利。
    评论指出，在敌我力量对比中，南越军民有许多非常基本的长处，敌人有许多非常基本的弱点。敌人比较重要的长处在于物质技术。进攻敌人的作战工具和技术装备集中的地方，不仅能限制和消除敌人的这个长处，而且还加深了敌人的弱点和困难。
