We are filled with boundless excitement and joy as we listen to the Party Central Committee's decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This wise decision is a brilliant manifestation of Mao Zedong Thought, a guiding document for the Cultural Revolution, and a fundamental guarantee for thoroughly carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Party's correct line, principles, and policies for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are like a lighthouse, illuminating the path forward for the Cultural Revolution. They greatly boost the morale of the revolutionary people nationwide and thoroughly crush the arrogance of the anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought clique. We will wholeheartedly and resolutely implement the Party Central Committee's wise and correct decision. We pledge: We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, under your wise leadership, together with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers across the country, charge into the forefront of this great revolutionary movement. We will definitely thoroughly overthrow, smash, and expose the capitalist roaders in power within the Party, thoroughly criticize all reactionary bourgeois "authorities," reform education, and in the struggle, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works. We will achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We will forever be Chairman Mao's good students, devote our lives to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, and march forward forever!

Long live the great Communist Party of China!
Long live our beloved leader Chairman Mao!
Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!
Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!
