One day, a British merchant ship docked at the Tianjin New Port. A British sailor rushed down from the high gangway and enthusiastically said to a customs inspector at our border inspection station in English, "Our ship is visiting your country for the first time. I have long wanted to see the new China under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong. As soon as I set foot on the soil of new China, I felt that new China is great. So, I would like to ask you to teach me a Chinese phrase as a memento of our first meeting." After finishing, he looked expectantly for a reply.

Our inspector understood the foreign friend's love for new China and Chairman Mao, so he taught him the phrase "Long Live Chairman Mao" and also translated the meaning into English. Upon hearing this, the sailor jumped for joy and immediately ran back to the ship, repeatedly shouting, "Long Live Chairman Mao! Long Live Chairman Mao!..."

That evening, most of the crew members on the ship had learned to shout "Long Live Chairman Mao" in Chinese.

When they returned to their country, each of them held a few copies of the English edition of Chairman Mao Zedong's selected works. As the ship departed from the dock, they continued to shout in Chinese, "Long Live Chairman Mao! Long Live Chairman Mao!" The shouts seemed to fly across the ocean, echoing around the world.

　　“毛主席万岁”
　　张贵春
    有一天，一艘英国商轮在天津新港码头靠了岸。一名英国水手从高高的船梯上跑下来，热情地用英语对我边防检查站的一位检查员说：“我们这艘船第一次来贵国，我很早就想看看在毛泽东主席领导下的新中国的风貌。我刚踏上新中国的土地，就觉得新中国好。所以，我想请您教我一句中国话，作为我们初见的纪念。”说完，他用期待的神情等待回答。
    我们的检查员很理解这位外国朋友热爱新中国、热爱毛主席的心情，就教了他一句“毛主席万岁”，又把这句话的意思翻译成英语。他听了高兴得跳了起来，立刻朝船上跑去，嘴里不停地喊着：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！……”
    当天晚上，这艘船上的大部分船员就都会用中国话喊“毛主席万岁”了。
    他们归国的时候，每个人手里都拿着几本英文版的毛泽东著作单行本。轮船驶离码头了，他们还不住地用中国话高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”这呼声，仿佛飞渡重洋，响彻五洲。
