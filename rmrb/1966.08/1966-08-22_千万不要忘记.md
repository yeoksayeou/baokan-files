	Never Forget
	I have never forgotten the miserable experiences of the old society. My father, elder brother, and younger brother were all tortured to death. My mother worked as a wet nurse for the landlords, and my sister and I begged for food. At the age of eight, I herded cattle for the landlords, and at fourteen, I began my apprenticeship, often enduring cold, hunger, beatings, and curses. After liberation, the Party and Chairman Mao saved me from the sea of suffering. However, the overthrown landlord and bourgeoisie classes are not reconciled to their defeat and always dream of a reversal of fortune.

	Sun Yefang, you oppose the theory of class struggle, aiming to numb our fighting spirit, so that you can carry out a capitalist restoration. Let me tell you, that won't work!

						Lake South Iron and Steel Plant worker, Ai Guangdao

	In our Nanqiao Village, before liberation, there were more than twenty households of "Xizi" (slaves). We toiled year-round in the hardest labor, living a life worse than cattle. My father could not bear such humiliation and went to Southeast Asia. Once, when he returned, he wore a black satin shirt. The landlord saw it and said that "Xizi" could not wear such a shirt, tearing it to pieces on the spot. My uncle returned from another place, and just because he was wearing shoes, the landlord said he was "rebelling," beating him severely.

	After liberation, we stood up and became masters of our own fate. However, the class enemies will not give up. They are still carrying out restoration activities, trying to make us return to the life of "Xizi." Sun Yefang, you oppose class struggle, which is to let the landlords and tyrants ride roughshod over us again. This will never happen. We poor and lower-middle peasants will definitely fight you to the end.

	Party Secretary of Nanqiao Brigade, Doushan Commune, Taishan County, Guangdong, Li Qiupei

	Chairman Mao said: Class struggle, once grasped, is effective. This is absolutely true. This spring, during the drought resistance struggle, we insisted on self-reliance to build water conservancy projects. However, the landlord elements incited, saying: "This year will be a severe drought, wells will dry up, and building canals is like a blind man lighting a lamp—wasting oil!" We poor and lower-middle peasants immediately fought against this reactionary speech and mobilized the masses to open lime kilns, building more than four hundred meters of anti-seepage canals, leading water to the fields. Seventy percent of the brigade's land achieved water conservancy.

	Sun Yefang does not allow us to grasp class struggle, so we must grasp class struggle even more firmly and do a good job in production. Members of Jiu Daohe Commune, Fenyang County, Shanxi: Zhang Guimei, Li Jinyin, Wang Fengying, Cao Xiaoe, Yu Jinyu

    千万不要忘记
    我时刻也没有忘记在旧社会的悲惨遭遇。父亲、哥哥、弟弟都被折磨死了，母亲给地主家当奶妈，我和妹妹讨饭。我八岁就给地主家放牛，十四岁开始当学徒，经常挨冻忍饿，挨打受骂。解放以后，党和毛主席把我从苦海里救了出来。但是，被推翻了的地主资产阶级并不甘心于自己的失败，总是梦想变天。
    孙冶方，你反对阶级斗争的学说，想要麻痹我们的斗志，好让你们搞资本主义复辟，告诉你，这办不到！
                      湖南株洲冶炼厂工人　艾光道
    我们南乔村，解放前住着二十多户“西仔”（就是农奴）。我们终年做最苦的工，过着牛马不如的生活。我父亲受不了这样的凌辱，到南洋去了。有一次回来，他穿了一件黑胶绸衫。地主看见了，说“西仔”不能穿这种衫，当场把它撕烂了。我叔叔从外地回来，只因穿了鞋，地主就说他要“造反”了，把他毒打了一顿。
    解放后，我们翻了身，当家作了主人。但是，阶级敌人是不会死心的，他们还在进行复辟活动，想要我们回到“西仔”的生活。孙冶方，你反对搞阶级斗争，就是要让地主恶霸重新骑到我们的头上，这是永远办不到的。我们贫下中农一定要坚决和你斗争到底。
    广东台山县斗山公社南乔大队党支部书记　李球柏
    毛主席说：阶级斗争，一抓就灵。真是千真万确。今春，在抗旱斗争中，我们坚持自力更生兴修水利，而地主分子却煽动说：“今年要大旱，井枯水干，修渠道是瞎子点灯——白熬油！”我们贫下中农马上对这种反动言论进行了斗争，并动员群众开办石灰窑，修筑了四百多米长的防渗渠道，引水上垣，全队百分之七十的土地实现了水利化。
    孙冶方不让我们抓阶级斗争，我们就越是要紧紧抓住阶级斗争，搞好生产。山西汾阳县峪道河公社社员张桂梅　李吉银　王凤英曹效娥　于金娥
