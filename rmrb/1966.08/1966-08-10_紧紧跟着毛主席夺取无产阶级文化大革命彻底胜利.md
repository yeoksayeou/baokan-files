They have expressed their most enthusiastic and resolute support for the decision of the Party Central Committee. They unanimously believe that the Party Central Committee's decision is a new development of Mao Zedong Thought, a great program for the new stage of the socialist revolution, and a guide to action for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have resolutely declared that they will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Beijing

The workers, peasants, students, and cadres of the capital have been continuously coming to the Party Central Committee's location and the Beijing Municipal Committee's new office since last night until late tonight, bringing in joyous reports and pledges. At the reception station in front of the Party Central Committee's location, the sounds of drums, firecrackers, songs, and slogans have blended together, shaking the heavens and the earth. The revolutionary masses have been continuously shouting: "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" The responsible officials and staff of the Party Central Committee's General Office have enthusiastically received the revolutionary masses from various industries at the reception station and have expressed their intention to convey the revolutionary enthusiasm and determination of the masses to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.

Shanghai

The broad revolutionary people of Shanghai listened to the central decision on the radio last night with great excitement. This morning, many of Shanghai's main streets were filled with parade teams. People carried large portraits of Chairman Mao, held up red flags, shouted slogans, sang revolutionary songs, and marched forward with their heads held high. Songs like "The Ship Sails on with the Helmsman" and "The East Is Red" echoed over the Huangpu River until the evening.

The entire city's model in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, the Red Thunder Youth Group of the Shanghai Synthetic Fiber Research Institute, enthusiastically discussed the Party Central Committee's decision. Group leader Qi Zhishao excitedly said, "With this decision, we revolutionary youth can better carry forward the communist style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, and advance victoriously along the direction indicated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao!" Many workers in factories said: With this invincible spiritual atomic bomb, we are not afraid of how cunning and treacherous the representatives of the bourgeoisie may be, we will definitely quickly smash the resistance to the Cultural Revolution, and we will definitely sweep away all harmful elements, leaving none!

The broad masses of the suburban people's communes, who are engaged in a tight battle of harvesting and sowing, were greatly inspired by the broadcast of the Party Central Committee's decision during their busy time. The advanced agricultural worker of the city, the active learner of Chairman Mao's works, the party branch secretary of Zhangjianham Brigade, Baoshan County, Wusong People's Commune, Pan Dongcai, said excitedly: With this decision, it is as if the fields have received timely rain. With it, we will definitely achieve a bumper harvest in the Cultural Revolution.

Last night, many colleges and universities such as Huadong Teachers University, Fudan University, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai Conservatory of Music, and Shanghai Normal University were in an uproar. Revolutionary teachers and students shouted slogans enthusiastically and sang "The East Is Red" and "The Ship Sails on with the Helmsman" in unison; they immediately wrote big-character posters to express their most resolute and enthusiastic support for the Party Central Committee's decision.

Guangzhou

The revolutionary masses in various factories, offices, and schools in Guangzhou enthusiastically held meetings and discussions, and wrote letters and called newspapers to express their most resolute and enthusiastic support for the Party Central Committee's decision. Zhou Muxian, a core militia member, an outstanding shooter, and a lathe operator at Guangzhou Heavy Machinery Factory, said that the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have entrusted such a great task to the masses, pointing out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution can only be a self-liberation of the masses and cannot adopt any method of substitution. This has greatly inspired me. We must carry this Cultural Revolution through to the end. Huang Kun, an old poor peasant from Lianxing Brigade, Xintan Commune in the suburbs, said excitedly: "The Party Central Committee's decision is really inspiring. Chairman Mao teaches us that commune peasants should also criticize the bourgeoisie. We poor and lower-middle peasants will definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions to sweep away all ghosts and monsters and defend the socialist mountains and rivers."

The revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of various colleges and universities in Guangzhou marched in columns to the streets and held a rally of revolutionary unity of teachers, students, and staff in front of the sports field at the Martyrs' Cemetery of the Guangzhou Uprising, expressing their heartfelt support and greatest determination to implement the Party Central Committee's decision.

Hundreds of thousands of workers in the city have expressed their determination to respond to the call of the Party Central Committee and charge into the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Li Suwen, the deputy director of the Shenyang Peace Food Store, said excitedly: The beloved Party Central Committee and beloved leader Chairman Mao not only teach us the importance of carrying out the Cultural Revolution but also kindly point out the policies and methods of how to carry out the Cultural Revolution. The more I read, the clearer my mind becomes, the brighter my eyes become, the stronger my bones become, the bolder my courage becomes, the more methods I have, and the more powerful I feel. Engineer Wei Fengying of the Northeast Machinery Manufacturing Plant and engineer Wang Feng'en, who came from a worker's background at the Shenyang Transformer Plant, both expressed their determination to study and propagate this important decision carefully and implement it thoroughly, carrying the Cultural Revolution to its depths.

At the meeting held by the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, revolutionary leftist youth and leftist students were exceptionally excited.

Many units immediately held discussions and posted red joyous reports, enthusiastically hailing the Party Central Committee's wise decision. The workers of the advanced production unit, Hongxing Spark Plug Factory in Chengdu City, said at the discussion meeting that after hearing this decision, the direction is clearer, the eyes are brighter, and the boundaries of who our enemies and friends are are clearer. The revolutionary teachers and students of Sichuan University unanimously believe that this great decision is the greatest trust, support, and encouragement from the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. We resolutely and enthusiastically support it. More than 400 half-working and half-studying and half-farming and half-studying students and revolutionary teachers from the Political Education Department and the Chinese Department of Sichuan Normal University said: The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao call on us to liberate ourselves in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The broad revolutionary masses, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres in Xi'an City enthusiastically support the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The revolutionary teachers and students of Xi'an No. 23 Middle School generally reflected that the Party Central Committee's decision has pointed out the direction of the battle, stipulated the tactics, strategies, and policies of the struggle, and is the fundamental guarantee for achieving a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. All revolutionary cadres of Dongguan South Street Commune wrote in a letter to the local newspaper: We support the Party Central Committee's decision by ten thousand times, ten thousand times, and ten thousand times. Zhang Yun, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works and a model worker at the Xi'an Pharmaceutical Company, said excitedly: This decision has given us support, bolstered our courage, and increased our determination. We will resolutely sweep away all ghosts and monsters and will not stop until we achieve complete victory.

The People's Liberation Army

According to Xinhua News Agency on the 9th, the broad cadres and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army enthusiastically support the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. From last night to today, at the front line of sea defense, in the southwest border, at the naval dock, at the air force airfield, and in various camps, the cadres and soldiers have been seriously listening to the radio and reading newspapers. With their deep feelings of unlimited trust and love for the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, they have been holding discussions, writing big-character posters, and pledges, expressing their resolute support and loyal implementation of the Party Central Committee's wise decision.

The iron soldier Mai Xiande, while in the hospital, heard the Party Central Committee's decision and immediately stood up and shouted: "Resolutely support the Party Central Committee's decision!" "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end!" The pilots of a certain flying squadron of the Air Force, who have consecutively won the title of "Four Good" for five years, held an enthusiastic discussion throughout the night. Everyone said that the Party Central Committee's decision has touched our hearts, and every word is a support for the revolutionary masses and a heavy blow to all ghosts and monsters. This decision is the steering wheel for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to proceed victoriously and is another new contribution of Chairman Mao to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. The political department cadres of a certain regiment of the Xinjiang Military Region listened to the broadcast and, despite the heavy rain, went down to the company and sat with the soldiers for a discussion. Everyone unanimously believed that the issuance of this decision by the Party Central Committee will make China's unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution develop more magnificently. The leadership of the Engineering Corps and the cadres and soldiers of various units said at the discussion that we study, propagate, and implement this decision. The most fundamental thing is to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle.

The broad cadres and soldiers of the units in Guangzhou, Nanjing, Shenyang, Wuhan, Chengdu, Kunming, Jinan, Lanzhou, and Inner Mongolia unanimously believed at the discussion that the Party Central Committee's decision fully reflects Chairman Mao's consistent advocacy of the great thought of the mass line. This is the greatest trust, strongest support, and encouragement for the revolutionary masses. We will forever be loyal to the Party, loyal to Chairman Mao, and loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and fight down and expose all anti-Party and anti-socialist elements. We will not stop until we achieve complete victory.
