I Can Study Chairman Mao's Books Too!

To the members of the Kang Production Brigade, Chen Yalin

Some people always ask me, "You are already eighty-three years old, and it seems like the sun is setting and the four planks of your coffin are about to close. Why are you still so eager to study Chairman Mao's books?" They don't know that I am able to live to this age and see socialism, all thanks to Chairman Mao! If it weren't for Chairman Mao and the Communist Party's leadership, my husband and I would have long since died. Chairman Mao is our great benefactor. If I don't study Chairman Mao's books and listen to his words, it would be ungrateful!

I have lived through three dynasties. During the Qing Dynasty and the Kuomintang's reactionary rule, I never had a good day, never had a good meal, and lived worse than pigs and dogs. At fifteen, I was married to Huangshandong. My family had no land, so we had to rent fields from the landlords to farm. Before the crops were even harvested, the landlords and their henchmen would come to collect rent. In the old society, I gave birth to two sons and three daughters, but they were either sold or died, and not one of them survived. My eldest son was the last piece of flesh and blood I had, and he was my lifeline. Because there was nothing to eat at home, he had to go begging. One time, he never returned. When I found him, oh my! He was dead by the roadside, and his body was even bitten by dogs. Later, I found out that he had picked a chili pepper from the landlord's field to eat and was beaten to death by the landlord. In that old society of cannibals, my husband and I suffered like this for fifty or sixty years, until we were reduced to two old bones, crawling to beg for food!

Fortunately, the Communist Party came, and our bitter days ended, making our lives sweeter each day. Today, although we are old and have no children, we have never gone hungry. Whenever we are sick, the entire village's cadres and people care for us. Some go to call the doctor, others come to visit, calling me "Mother" and "Grandmother," more affectionate than our own children. Whenever there are difficulties, the government takes care of us, and the collective helps us. Just last year, the production brigade gave us a sum of grain and money, allowing us to eat white rice every meal. Comparing the old days with today, Chairman Mao's kindness is as heavy as a mountain. I am living today because of Chairman Mao's blessings. How can I not study Chairman Mao's books and listen to his words?

Someone asked me, "You don't know a single character, how do you study Chairman Mao's books?" I say, as long as you love Chairman Mao in your heart, even if you can't read, you can listen attentively and remember. The first night I went to listen to the instructor's lecture, it was on "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." Chairman Mao's teachings are all about the poor people rising up and making revolution, and I understood it as soon as I heard it. That night, after the class, I told my old husband the entire lesson. He listened and said happily, "Ah! Life is indeed sweet now. Who would have thought that you could study Chairman Mao's books in your old age!" My old husband said that, and I was even happier, thinking: The Foolish Old Man was in his nineties and still led his descendants to move mountains every day. I am younger than him by more than ten years. As long as I am old but not feeble-minded, I can overcome all difficulties and strive for victory. I can study more of Chairman Mao's books and listen to his words even better. So, starting from last winter, I go to study no matter if it's windy or rainy, and no matter if it's dark or the road is slippery. I always go to the study sessions, never missing a class.

I have been studying Chairman Mao's books for over a year now, and I feel my heart is clearer and even my body feels younger. I want to be like Comrades White and Zhang Side, with no selfish motives, and as long as I have a breath, I will contribute to the revolution. In the past, the manure from the pigs and chickens in my private plot was all turned over to the collective. When some team members go to work, if their children have no one to take care of at home, I will take care of them, putting in an extra effort. Whatever I can do, I will do my best to do it, to be a person beneficial to the people.

### 我也能学毛主席的书了！

    我也能学毛主席的书了！
    对坑生产队社员　陈亚林
    一些人总喜欢这样问我：“你老人家已经八十三岁了，是日头落岭、四块棺材板都快要合起来的人了，为什么还这样热心读毛主席的书呢？”他们不知道，我能活到八十几岁，亲眼看到社会主义，是托毛主席的福！要不是有毛主席、共产党的领导，我们夫妻早就骨头打鼓了！毛主席是我们穷苦人的大恩人，我若不读毛主席的书，不听毛主席的话，那就是忘本！
    我是经过三个朝代的人。在清朝和国民党反动统治时期，我没有过一天好日子，没有吃过一餐好饭，活着比猪狗还贱。我十五岁嫁到黄山洞，我家无田无地，要向地主租田来耕。收的谷子还没有离田，地主、狗腿子就来催租了。在旧社会，我生养过两男三女，但卖的卖、死的死，一个也没有剩下来。我的大男儿，是留在我身边最后的一块骨肉，也是我的命根子，因为家里没有吃的，他只得出门讨饭。谁知有一次一去不回，找到他时，天呵！只见他死在路边，连尸身都被狗咬烂了。后来，我才知道，他因为太饿，在地主的地里摘了一个辣椒吃，被地主看见，把他活生生地打死了。在那吃人的旧社会，我们夫妻就是这样在苦海中浸了五、六十年，到后来只剩下两把老柴骨头，爬着也要去讨饭！
    好得来了共产党，使我俩苦尽甘来，日子越过越甜。今天，我俩虽然年老，又无儿无女，却从未挨饥挨饿。一有病痛，全村干部、群众，人人关心，这个去请医生，那个来问好，上叫阿娘，下叫阿婆的，比自家儿女还亲。一有困难，政府就照顾，集体又帮助。单是去年，生产队就帮补了我一笔粮食钱，让我俩餐餐不离白米饭。想起旧日，对比今天，毛主席的恩情真是重如山，我如今天天都托毛主席的福，叫我怎能不读毛主席的书，怎能不听毛主席的话呢？
    有人又问我，你大字不识一个，是怎样读毛主席的书的呢？我讲，只要心里热爱毛主席，不识字就用心听，用脑记。我第一晚去听辅导员讲课，是讲《愚公移山》。毛主席讲的都是穷苦人翻身和闹革命的道理，一听就入脑。那天晚上学完回家，我就一五一十将课文讲给我老头子听。他听了，乐呵呵地对我说：“咳！如今日子的确甜，想不到你临老能读毛主席的书了！”老头子这样讲，我更加高兴了，心想：愚公九十几岁，还带领子孙天天去搬山，我比愚公还年轻十几年，只要人老心不老，排除万难，去争取胜利，还可以多读毛主席的书，更好地听毛主席的话。所以，从前年底开始，我不论吹风落雨，也不管天黑路滑，逢到学习时间，点把松火就去参加学习，从不缺课。
    我读毛主席的书已有一年多了，真是越学心水越清，连人也变得年轻了。我要像白求恩、张思德同志那样毫无自私自利之心，有一口气就要为革命出力气。过去落在自留地的猪屎、鸡屎，都交给了集体。有的社员出勤，家里的小孩没人料理，我就替他们看管看管，多操一份心。凡能做得到的事，我都尽力去做，做个有益于人民的人。
