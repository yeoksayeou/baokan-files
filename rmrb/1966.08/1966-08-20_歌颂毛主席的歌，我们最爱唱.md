On August 18, on Tiananmen Square, millions of people shouted “Long live Chairman Mao!” Millions of eyes looked towards Chairman Mao, and millions of hearts bloomed like sunflowers towards Chairman Mao. At this moment, revolutionary cultural workers also sang and cheered with workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary students. Li Xijing, an opera performer from a certain unit of the PLA, said: “Recently, one piece of good news after another, Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee leaders have encouraged us to carry out the cultural revolution, how can we not be excited? We will use Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon to thoroughly defeat all ghosts and monsters.” Wang Shixing, a member of the unit’s creative team, said: “We will study Chairman Mao’s works for thousands and tens of thousands of years, and Chairman Mao will be with the people for thousands and tens of thousands of years. After studying the ‘Communiqué’ and the ‘Sixteen Points,’ we love Chairman Mao even more. Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee have supported us and given us courage. We will hold tight to our guns and pick up our pens, always be at the forefront of the revolution. We love Mao Zedong Thought without limit, and we will use the weapon of art to vigorously promote Mao Zedong Thought.”

Young students from art academies participated in the meeting with the attitude of revolutionary pioneers. In the ranks of students from the Central Conservatory of Music, Wang Weiming, Han Minxiu, and their classmates cheered together that the Communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee and the Decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution fully met their needs for struggle. Han Minxiu said: “Chairman Mao trusts the people the most, and the people trust Chairman Mao the most. The ghosts and monsters want to poison us and suppress us, but they cannot. We have the support of Chairman Mao, and all victories belong to the great Mao Zedong Thought.” A female student from the PLA Academy of Art said: “In our struggle against ghosts and monsters, we rely on Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao’s literary and artistic thought is our guide. We must resolutely follow the path of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serve workers, peasants, and soldiers. I am a singer, and I love to sing songs praising Chairman Mao and workers, peasants, and soldiers. I love to sing songs like ‘The Ship Needs a Helmsman’ the most.”

Many cultural groups and cultural departments in Beijing were extremely excited that day. They beat drums and gongs, and sang loudly. They made a vow to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. They expressed their determination to use the weapon of art to promote the decisions and instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They must fight together with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the cultural revolution, advance together, and under the leadership of Chairman Mao, launch a fierce attack on old ideas, old culture, old customs, old habits, and ghosts and monsters.

　　歌颂毛主席的歌，我们最爱唱
    八月十八日，天安门广场上，多少万人欢呼“毛主席万岁！”多少万双眼睛望向毛主席，多少万颗心像葵花朝毛主席开放。这时候和工农兵、革命师生一起欢唱、欢呼的也有革命文艺工作者。解放军某部歌剧演员李西京说：“最近喜事接喜事，毛主席和党中央领导同志这样鼓舞我们闹文化革命，怎么不使我们激动？我们要用毛泽东思想作武器，把一切牛鬼蛇神彻底斗垮。”部队创作人员王石祥说：“我们千年、万年学习毛主席著作，毛主席千年万年和人民在一起。学了‘公报’、‘十六条’，使我们越加热爱毛主席。毛主席和党中央给我们撑了腰，壮了胆。我们要握紧枪杆子，拿起笔杆子，在革命中永远当尖兵。我们无限热爱毛泽东思想，要用文艺武器大力宣传毛泽东思想。”
    年青的艺术院校同学，以革命小闯将的姿态参加大会。在中央音乐学院学生行列里，王伟明、韩民秀和同学们一起连连欢呼党的八届十一中全会公报和关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定正符合他们斗争的需要。韩民秀说：“毛主席最信任人民群众，人民群众最信任毛主席。牛鬼蛇神想毒害我们，压制我们，办不到。我们有毛主席的支持，一切胜利归功于伟大的毛泽东思想。”解放军艺术学院一位女学员说：“在我们同牛鬼蛇神斗争中，靠的是毛泽东思想。毛主席文艺思想是我们的指针，我们一定要坚决走与工农兵相结合的道路，为工农兵服务。我是学唱歌的，我就爱唱歌颂毛主席、歌颂工农兵的歌。我最爱唱《大海航行靠舵手》这样的歌。”
    北京许多文艺团体和文化部门的革命群众，这天极其兴奋，他们敲锣打鼓，放声歌唱。他们发出把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的誓言。他们表示要用文艺武器宣传毛主席和党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定和指示。一定要在文化大革命中和广大工农兵一起战斗，一起前进，一起在毛主席统帅下，向旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，向牛鬼蛇神展开猛烈的进攻。
