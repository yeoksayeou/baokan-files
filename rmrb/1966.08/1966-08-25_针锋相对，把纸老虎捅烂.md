More than a year ago, I and eight other comrades experienced a serious international class struggle in Brazil. On the surface, the balance of power between the enemy and us was extremely unfavorable. The enemy had not only the Brazilian reactionaries but also the big and small spies of U.S. imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits in Brazil. We were just nine people far from our motherland, imprisoned, and unarmed. However, we were not intimidated by the seemingly powerful enemy. We remembered Chairman Mao's teaching: Revolutionary people should not be deceived by surface phenomena but should see the rotten, dying, and hollow nature of the reactionaries. We must truly regard imperialism and all reactionaries as paper tigers. From this point, we established our strategic thinking. Although the enemy was temporarily very arrogant, illegally arresting us, brutally torturing us, shamelessly spreading rumors and slandering us, and even attempting to kidnap us to Taiwan, all this did not indicate the enemy's strength. On the contrary, it showed their weakness and helplessness. Our cause is just. Truth is on our side. With a powerful motherland as our backing and the support of revolutionary people all over the world, as long as we dare to fight and are good at fighting, fully utilizing our favorable factors and turning unfavorable conditions into favorable ones, we will surely achieve victory.

From the first day of our arrest, the common belief of defending the dignity and honor of our motherland and the class feelings of sharing life and death united us like a giant made of steel. Our battle slogan was: Stand firm, persist in struggle, and be willing to sacrifice our lives to defend the honor of our motherland. After we were illegally arrested and imprisoned, the enemy began to torture us severely. We told the enemy: "You can destroy our bodies, but our thoughts will defeat your thoughts." Then, the enemy openly announced that they would kidnap us to Taiwan. We nine comrades unanimously protested strongly, firmly stating: "We would rather die in Brazil than go to Taiwan. We would rather stand and die than kneel and live. If you insist on doing so, you can only send our corpses to Taiwan, not a living person." The enemy was brutal but weak. Under our persistent struggle, the Brazilian authorities were finally forced to publicly announce the cancellation of their plot to kidnap us to Taiwan. We also actively sought opportunities to take the initiative and engage in head-to-head struggles with the enemy. For example, in the early days after we were unjustly arrested, the enemy brought in many reporters from Brazil and other countries every day to take our photos to spread rumors and deceive the public. At first, we resisted and refused to be photographed. Later, we studied and felt that we could let them take photos because we could also use this opportunity to expose the enemy. One evening, the enemy planned a television program to slander us and incite the Brazilian public to be hostile towards China. In the television program, the enemy barked and raved, calling our spare rhubarb detox pills and pills for invigorating the body poison and opium, and calling the needles used for acupuncture poison needles. They also slandered that we wanted to use these "poisons" and "poison needles" to assassinate Brazilian military and political figures. We heard the enemy's nonsense and were all extremely angry. We decided: Where the enemy provokes, we counterattack; where the enemy spreads rumors, we refute; where the enemy spreads rumors, we expose. The enemy did not expect that I understood Portuguese. After they finished speaking, I sternly denounced the Brazilian spies' persecution of us and strongly protested against their plot to kidnap us to Taiwan. A spy chief was flustered and hurriedly intervened: "Who wants to kidnap you?" I pointed at him and shouted: "It's you!" This left the fellow stunned and at a loss, and all the big and small spies present were in a mess. Because we dared to engage in head-to-head struggles, we poked a hole in the seemingly powerful enemy in this television program, exposing the enemy's paper tiger nature to the Brazilian public.

In the more than three months of intense court struggle, because we strategically regarded the enemy as a paper tiger, we saw every rumor, every false evidence, and every persecution plot of the enemy as a noose around their necks. At the same time, tactically, we took the enemy seriously, regarding them as real tigers, and in every specific struggle, we took a cautious attitude, emphasizing the art of struggle. For every struggle, we made thorough and detailed preparations, finally completely exposing the enemy's evil plots, and completely defeating the joint attack of U.S. imperialism, the Brazilian reactionaries, and the Kuomintang bandits, poking holes in the paper tiger. In the end, with the resolute support of the people of our motherland and the support of the people of the world, we finally returned to our motherland in victory, returning to the side of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.

In the 380 days of anti-persecution struggle in Brazil, there was fighting every day and every moment. Our struggle victory once again powerfully proved that Chairman Mao's statement that "imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers" is a great and unshakable truth. It is this truth that kept us spiritually superior and always in control of the initiative in the struggle, guiding us to the final victory of the struggle.

    针锋相对，把纸老虎捅烂
    张宝生
    一年多以前，我和另外八位同志，在巴西经历了一场严重的国际阶级斗争。敌我双方力量的对比，从表面上看，从当时当地看，是对我们十分不利的。敌方不仅有巴西的反动派，还有美帝国主义和蒋匪帮在巴西的大小特务。而我们却不过是远离祖国、身陷囹圄、手无寸铁的九个人。但是，我们并没有被貌似强大的敌人吓倒。我们记住了毛主席的教导：革命的人们不要为表面现象所迷惑，而要看到反动派的腐朽的、垂死的、外强中干的本质。必须如实地把帝国主义和一切反动派，都看成纸老虎。从这点上，建立我们的战略思想。尽管敌人一时十分猖狂，非法逮捕我们，残暴地拷打我们，无耻地造谣、诬蔑我们，甚至企图绑架我们到台湾去，但是，这一切并不说明敌人强大，恰恰相反，正表明它的虚弱，没办法。我们的事业是正义的。真理在我们这一边。有强大的祖国作后盾，有全世界革命人民的支持，只要我们敢于斗争，善于斗争，充分发挥我们的有利因素，变不利条件为有利条件，我们就一定能夺取胜利。
    从被捕的头一天开始，维护祖国尊严和荣誉的共同信念，同生死，共患难的阶级感情，把我们团结得像一个钢铁般的巨人。我们的战斗口号是：站稳立场，坚持斗争，宁愿牺牲个人生命，也要维护祖国的荣誉。我们被非法逮捕入狱后，敌人就严刑拷打我们。我们对敌人说：“你们可以摧残我们的肉体，但是我们的思想将战胜你们的思想。”接着，敌人竟公开宣布要把我们绑架去台湾。我们九个同志异口同声地提出最强烈的抗议，我们坚定地表示：“宁可死在巴西，决不去台湾。我们宁愿站着死，决不跪着生。如果你们定要硬干，就只能把我们的尸体送去台湾，而送不去一个活人。”敌人是残暴的，又是虚弱的。在我们坚持斗争下，巴西当局终于被迫当众宣布取消绑架我们去台湾的阴谋。我们还积极寻找战机，主动出击，与敌人展开针锋相对的斗争。例如，在我们被无理逮捕后的头些日子，敌人每天都招来许多巴西和其他国家的记者，要给我们拍照，以便造谣，欺骗公众。对此，我们起初跟他们斗，拒绝拍照。后来，我们研究，觉得可以让他们拍照，因为我们也可以利用这个机会，揭露敌人。有一天晚上，敌人预谋了一个电视节目，企图达到诬蔑我们和煽动巴西公众敌视中国的目的。在电视节目上，敌人张牙舞爪，狂吠乱叫，把我们备用的羚翘解毒丸、人丹等说成是毒药、鸦片，把针灸用针说成是毒针，并且诬蔑我们要用这些“毒药”、“毒针”来暗杀巴西的军政要人。我们听到敌人的一派胡言乱语，个个愤怒万分。我们决定：敌人在那里挑衅，我们就在那里反击；敌人在那里造谣，我们就在那里辟谣，就在那里痛驳。敌人没有料到我懂葡萄牙语，等他们把话讲完以后，我就严正谴责了巴西特务对我们的迫害，并强烈抗议企图把我们绑架到台湾去的阴谋。有个特务头子手忙脚乱，连忙插话抵赖：“谁要绑架你们？”我指着他大声地说道：“就是你！”这一来，整得这个家伙目瞪口呆，不知所措，在场的大小特务也狼狈万分。由于我们敢于进行针锋相对的斗争，在这次电视节目上，把貌似强大的敌人捅了一下，结果把纸给捅破了，把敌人的纸老虎的原形暴露在巴西公众面前。
    在三个多月尖锐的法庭斗争中，由于我们在战略上如实地把敌人看作纸老虎，把敌人的每个谣言、每个假证据、每个迫害阴谋，都看做是套在他们脖子上的一根根绞索。同时，在战术上重视敌人，把它们看作真老虎，在每个具体斗争问题上，采取谨慎态度，讲究斗争艺术，对每一次斗争，都作了充分细致的准备，终于彻底揭穿了敌人的罪恶阴谋，完全战胜了美帝国主义、巴西反动派和蒋匪帮的联合进攻，把纸老虎捅得稀烂。最后，由于祖国人民的坚决支持，世界人民的声援，我们终于胜利地回到了祖国，回到了党中央和毛主席的身边。
    在巴西的三百八十天的反迫害斗争中，天天都有战斗，时时刻刻都在战斗。我们斗争的胜利，又一次有力地证明：毛主席关于“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的论断，是伟大的、颠扑不破的真理。正是这一真理，使我们在精神上始终处于优势，始终掌握斗争的主动权，引导着我们取得了斗争的最后胜利。
