The film "Two Families" (scripted by Lin Mocen, directed by Yuan Naichen, produced by Changchun Film Studio in 1963) stands firmly on the reactionary position of the landlord and bourgeoisie. Under the pretense of depicting the struggle between socialism and capitalism during the agricultural cooperativization movement, it maliciously slanders poor peasants, grossly distorts the rural landscape, incites individual farming, and fervently advocates for the restoration of capitalism. This anti-party, anti-socialist film, upon its release, sparked immense indignation among the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, who unanimously condemned it as a poisonous weed against the party and socialism.

The film "Two Families" focuses on the character of the "old poor peasant" Gao Zhenguo. What kind of "old poor peasant" is this? The film portrays him as a man who loves money above all else, whose entire soul is steeped in the stench of wealth. For Gao Zhenguo, making money and taking the capitalist road is his entire life's ideal and happiness. The film's scriptwriters and directors pass off the extreme decadence of the bourgeoisie's philosophy of "people die for money, birds die for food" as the worldview of the old poor peasant Gao Zhenguo. Gao Zhenguo tells his daughter Erzhu, "This year is 1953. I plan to store 2,000 units of grain, buy a cart and two pigs. By spring of 1954, I want to marry Xiaohai into our family and open a large flour mill with the Chen family... By 1955, I will buy 10 mu of land and hire two workers... In less than ten years, we will establish a large farm..." Which poor peasant in our country could come up with such a "plan"? Isn't this clearly the plan of a farm owner in a capitalist country?

Even more vile is that the scriptwriters and directors deliberately use the "old farmers' association" to tell the audience that Gao Zhenguo was the first to stand up and fight against the landlords during the land reform, and after the land reform, he actively produced and led the fight against drought, becoming the red flag of the entire village. The scriptwriters and directors attempt to use this narrative to tell people that old poor peasants like Gao Zhenguo, once they have risen, will inevitably forget their roots. They do not want to follow the party on the socialist road; they quickly inherit the worldview, philosophy of life, and exploitation methods of the landlord and rich peasant class; they insist on taking the capitalist road and have already become exploiters. "Two Families" distorts revolutionary old poor peasants into leaders of capitalist development after liberation, which is a malicious slander and attack on poor peasants, aiming to falsely claim that the proletarian revolutionary cause in our country will be abandoned halfway, and capitalism will be restored.

The scriptwriters and directors use numerous shots to praise Gao Zhenguo's spirit of "struggling and pulling" to become wealthy through individual farming. They particularly emphasize Gao Zhenguo's actions of pulling the cart, singing a song of praise for the spirit of individual farming with deep emotion. It tells the audience that Gao Zhenguo, through his own hard work like an ox, even more diligently striving, has become the richest man in the village. With a cart and ox, pigs and chickens filling the pen, lending money and buying land... all are achieved with the money he earned through his labor, which should be sympathized with and praised, and worthy of learning and emulating. This is not only a fervent praise of the capitalist road but also an exoneration of the bloody exploitation history of landlords and rich peasants, advocating the extremely reactionary theory of landlords and rich peasants becoming wealthy through labor.

The film depicts Gao Zhenguo as a hero who becomes rich through "struggling and pulling" and as a hero who competes with collective economy through individual farming. The film mentions our country's first Five-Year Plan, but we see no development of the national economy; the film writes about the mutual aid and cooperation movement, but we see no superiority. On the contrary, the individual farmer Gao Zhenguo's place is a scene of prosperity. His "Five-Year Plan" for developing capitalism is smoothly implemented, and almost all the farmers in the village (including the mutual aid team leader Chen Weibang) borrow grain from Gao Zhenguo. In the film, only Gao Zhenguo is arrogant and full of himself, while other farmers are dejected and worried. In short, the film tells people: individual farming is very good, Gao Zhenguo, who insists on taking the capitalist road, is the victorious "hero"; mutual aid and cooperation are very bad, farmers do not want to take the socialist road. The scriptwriters and directors use the stark contrast between individual farming prosperity and mutual aid and cooperation poverty to loudly entice and incite farmers to take Gao Zhenguo's road, with the purpose of making capitalism rampant in the countryside and destroying the people's communes.

No matter how the scriptwriters and directors distort right and wrong, slander the cooperativization movement, and beautify capitalism, our country has completely achieved agricultural cooperativization and communalization. The party has led all farmers to take the road of common prosperity, and the collective economy of agriculture has shown vigorous vitality and great superiority. The ironclad facts of history have made landlords, the bourgeoisie, and all anti-party, anti-socialist elements feel desperate and depressed. Thus, the scriptwriters and directors, with a heart full of regret and helplessness, spread many anti-party, anti-socialist black words through Gao Zhenguo's mouth. The scriptwriters and directors let Gao Zhenguo say "One family is full, a thousand families are resentful" during the mobilization to sell surplus grain, a extremely reactionary language; during the so-called "Five-Year Plan," they talk about the bourgeois theory of "there must be rich and poor in the world"; they let Gao Zhenguo propose "Left and right, you are not getting along with me" full of hatred protest; and they let Gao Zhenguo say three times "Pigs push forward, chickens pull backward, each has its own path" with a malicious implication. All of these are black words! In the film, a large number of typical thoughts, emotions, theories, and languages of landlords and the bourgeoisie are peddled, which is not clearly the venting of the scriptwriters and directors' anti-party, anti-socialist emotions?

Chairman Mao said: "The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China." The agricultural cooperativization is a great revolutionary movement under the leadership of the party. However, in this film, there is no trace of the party's leadership! There is no party member, only an "old farmers' association" that seems like a party member but does not reveal his identity. This "old farmers' association" does nothing but praise Gao Zhenguo and casually persuade a few times in the film. Xiaoyun seems to be a team leader, but she only appears in a few scenes in the film. These two characters, who seem to be party members, neither propagate the party's policies nor lead the cooperativization movement; neither grasp class struggle nor do ideological education work. It seems that the scriptwriters and directors arranged these two characters just for decoration, to disfigure and erase the party's leadership.

In the film, we cannot find a positive character worth learning from. The old poor peasant Li Cunfu and his wife do not even want to join the mutual aid team; only when Li Cunfu's wife is driven to sell the land and jump into the well, almost destroying the family, do they join the cooperative. They join not for socialism but to rely on the collective for survival. The mutual aid team leader Chen Weibang initially seems to be firmly on the socialist road, but the scriptwriters and directors depict him as a lazy man, with many labor forces in the family but still not enough food. Towards Gao Zhenguo's capitalist thoughts and behaviors, Chen Weibang can only sigh and use pastries to "convert." The poor peasant youth Chen Xiaohai is timid and afraid of hardship, willing to be exploited, living entirely for Erzhu; Erzhu defends her father's exploitation behavior, pretending to be modest, these two are clearly petty bourgeois intellectuals dressed in peasant clothes. Analyzing these poor peasant images in the film, it can be seen that the scriptwriters and directors are not just about depicting a single character incorrectly, but deliberately slandering poor peasants, opposing the revolution, and defaming the socialist road.

Chairman Mao as early as 1927 taught us: "Without poor peasants, there is no revolution. If you deny them, you deny the revolution. If you attack them, you attack the revolution." The attitude towards poor peasants has always been an important sign to test revolution and counter-revolution. Whether in the democratic revolutionary stage or the socialist revolutionary stage, poor peasants are the pillars of the rural revolution and the most reliable force of the party in the countryside. However, landlords, the bourgeoisie, and all anti-party, anti-socialist elements hate poor peasants who firmly follow the party to the core, seeing them as thorns in their eyes and flesh in their bones, always sparing no effort to vilify, slander, and attack poor peasants. They are anti-people and anti-revolution, often first attacking poor peasants who firmly defend the party and socialism, attempting to shake the party's most reliable pillar in the countryside and destroy the dictatorship of the proletariat. The vilification and slander of poor peasants are not breathing from the same hole as the landlords and the bourgeoisie?

Chairman Mao said: "The agricultural cooperativization movement, from the beginning, has been a serious struggle of thought and politics." The party relies on the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, unites the middle peasants, and on the road of cooperativization, has waged a resolute and repeated struggle against class enemies and capitalist spontaneous forces. However, in this film, there is no depiction of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants' struggle against capitalist spontaneous forces. That speculator Cat Whiskers, in broad daylight, brazenly engages in capitalist activities, lawless and unpunished, living freely, is never questioned. The scriptwriters and directors are so tolerant and favorable to speculators, while they maliciously distort and fabricate that stubborn Gao Zhenguo, who insists on taking the capitalist road, attempting to use this character to direct the struggle's spearhead towards revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants, the scriptwriters and directors' sinister intentions are not clear?

"Two Families" excludes and erases the party's leadership, slanders and disfigures the image of poor peasants, distorts class struggle, which fundamentally negates the dictatorship of the proletariat and the socialist system, fundamentally negates the agricultural cooperativization movement, and thus necessarily depicts the rural reality and cooperativization movement as pitch black. This is the scriptwriters and directors' wanton distortion of socialist rural areas and vicious attack on the socialist system!

The adaptation and shooting of the film "Two Families" were in 1963, after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee. At that time, the socialist education movement had been widely carried out in the countryside. The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, a conference of great historical significance, clearly expounded that there are classes and class struggles in socialist society, and called on the entire party and the people of the whole country not to forget class struggle. In this extensive and profound revolutionary movement of socialist education, the Central Committee proposed to greatly promote the advantages of poor and lower-middle peasants, organize revolutionary class forces, and repel the attacks of capitalist and feudal forces. It was precisely at this time that the scriptwriters and directors of the film "Two Families," under the banner of depicting class struggle, brazenly carried out anti-party, anti-socialist criminal activities. The release of "Two Families" is a reflection of the sharp class struggle in our country.

"An ant trying to shake a tree, how easy can it be!" The film "Two Families'" slander and curses against the party, socialism, and poor and lower-middle peasants do not harm the glory of the great party and the socialist system in the slightest, but only expose the ugly souls of this handful of anti-party, anti-socialist elements. Thus, it arouses the anger of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, thoroughly smashing their dream of restoring capitalism.

    鼓吹资本主义复辟的《两家人》
    高天红
    影片《两家人》（林漠晨编剧，袁乃晨导演，长春电影制片厂一九六三年摄制），完全站在地主资产阶级的反动立场上，打着表现农业合作化运动中社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争的幌子，恶毒地诽谤贫农，肆意歪曲农村面貌，煽动单干风，狂热地鼓吹资本主义复辟。这部反党反社会主义的影片一出笼，就激起了广大工农兵群众的极大愤慨，一致认为这是一株反党反社会主义的大毒草。
    影片《两家人》集中地塑造了“老贫农”高正国的形象。这是一个什么样的“老贫农”呢？影片把他写成一个爱财如命、整个灵魂都为铜臭浸透了的人物。发财，走资本主义道路，就是高正国的全部生活理想和幸福所在。影片编导者把资产阶级的极端腐朽的“人为财死，鸟为食亡”的人生哲学，冒充为老贫农高正国的人生观。高正国对女儿二珠说：“今年是五三年，我想存粮两千，拴上一辆牛车，养上两口猪。到五四年春天，我想招小海来咱家上门，再和陈家开个大粉坊……。到五五年我就买上十亩地，再请上两个帮工……。用不了十年，咱就下手办它个大农庄……。”这哪里是我国的一个老贫农想得出来的“计划”？这不分明是资本主义国家里农场主的计划吗？
    更恶毒的是，编导者特意通过“老农会”告诉观众，高正国曾经在土改时第一个站出来斗争地主，土改后积极生产，带头抗旱，是全村的一面红旗。编导者企图通过这段回述告诉人们，象高正国这样地地道道的老贫农，翻了身也必然忘本。他们不愿意跟着党走社会主义道路，他们很快就完全继承了地主富农的剥削阶级的人生观、处世哲学和剥削手段；他们坚持要走资本主义道路，而且已经变成了剥削阶级分子。《两家人》把革命的老贫农歪曲成翻身后坚持发展资本主义的带头人，是对贫农恶毒的诽谤和攻击，是妄图说明我国无产阶级革命事业将要半途而废，资本主义将要复辟。
    编导者用大量镜头，歌颂高正国“苦扒苦拽”地单干发家的精神。他们特别起劲地渲染了高正国拉牛车的动作，充满感情地唱出了一首单干精神的颂歌。它告诉观众，高正国全凭自己象牛一样地“苦扒苦拽”，甚至比牛还卖力地拚命单干，才成了全村的首富。车牛俱全，猪鸡满圈，放债买地……，都是用他劳动得来的钱换来的，是应该同情和赞美的，是值得学习和效法的。这除了狂热地歌颂资本主义道路以外，也是为地主富农的血腥剥削发家史开脱，宣扬极端反动的地主富农劳动发家的谬论。
    影片把高正国描绘成靠“苦扒苦拽”发财致富的好汉，描绘成靠个人单干同集体经济竞赛的“英雄”。影片提到了我国第一个五年计划，可是我们根本看不到国民经济的发展；影片写了互助合作运动，可是我们根本看不到它有丝毫优越性。相反，单干户高正国那里却是一片“兴旺景象”。他的发展资本主义的“五年计划”十分顺利地完成着，几乎全村所有的农民（包括互助组组长陈为邦在内）都借高正国的粮。在影片里，只有高正国趾高气扬，神气活现，其他农民都是垂头丧气，愁眉苦脸。总之，影片告诉人们：单干好得很，坚持走资本主义道路的高正国是胜利了的“英雄”；互助合作糟得很，农民们都不愿意走社会主义道路。编导者用单干发财和互助合作受穷的异常鲜明的对比，声嘶力竭地诱惑和煽动农民走高正国的道路，其目的不外是使资本主义在农村泛滥起来，搞垮人民公社。
    不管影片的编导者怎样颠倒黑白，诽谤合作化运动，美化资本主义，我国已经完全实现了农业合作化和公社化，党已经领导全体农民走上了共同富裕的道路，农业集体经济已经显示出了旺盛的生命力和巨大的优越性。铁一般的历史事实，使地主、资产阶级和一切反党反社会主义分子感到绝望和沮丧。于是，编导者以万分惋惜和无可奈何的心情，通过高正国的嘴，散布了许多反党反社会主义的黑话。编导者让高正国在别人动员他卖余粮时说出了“一家饱暖千家怨”这种极端反动的语言；在订所谓“五年计划”时大谈“世上总要有穷有富”的剥削阶级理论；让高正国提出“左一下，右一下，跟我过不去”的饱含仇恨的抗议；还让高正国三次说“猪往前拱，鸡往后扒，各有各的路”这种寓意恶毒的比喻。这些统统是黑话！在影片里大量贩卖这些典型的地主、资产阶级的思想、感情、理论、语言，不分明是编导者反党反社会主义情绪的宣泄吗？
    毛主席说：“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。”农业合作化是在党领导下的一场伟大的革命运动。可是，在这部影片中根本就看不到党的领导！没有一个党员，只有一个象党员而又不表明身份的“老农会”。这个“老农会”除了为高正国表功，不关痛痒地劝解几句之外，在影片里没起任何作用。小云似乎是一个团支书，可是她只是在影片里走了几个过场。这两个好象是党团员的人物，既没有宣传党的方针政策，又没领导合作化运动；既没抓阶级斗争，也没做思想教育工作。看来，编导者安排这两个人物，只是为了点缀，为了丑化和抹煞党的领导。
    在影片里，我们找不到一个值得学习的正面人物。老贫农李存夫妻连互助组也不愿参加，只是在贫病交困，李大妈被逼得卖了地、跳了井，几乎家破人亡的时候，才加入了合作社。他们入社，不是为了社会主义，而是投靠集体，安身活命。互助组长陈为邦初看起来好象是坚决走社会主义道路的，可是，编导者却把他描绘得象个懒汉，全家劳动力不少，家里粮食还不够吃。对于高正国的资本主义思想行为，陈为邦只会唉声叹气，只会用糕点去“感化”。贫农青年陈小海胆小怕事，甘受剥削，完全为了二珠活着；二珠为父亲的剥削行为辩护，装模作样，这两个分明是穿着农民服装的小资产阶级知识分子。分析了影片中这些贫农的形象，可以看出编导者绝不是对某一个人物描写不当的问题，而是有目的地在诽谤贫农，反对革命，污蔑社会主义道路。
    毛主席早在一九二七年就教导我们：“没有贫农，便没有革命。若否认他们，便是否认革命。若打击他们，便是打击革命。”对于贫农抱什么态度，从来就是检验革命和反革命的一个重要标志。不论在民主革命阶段，还是在社会主义革命阶段，贫农都是农村革命的支柱，都是党在农村最可靠的力量。而地主、资产阶级和一切反党反社会主义分子，对于坚决跟党走的贫农却恨之入骨，视为眼中钉、肉中刺，总是不遗余力千方百计地丑化、诽谤和攻击贫农。他们反人民、反革命，常常是首先打击坚决保卫党、保卫社会主义的贫农，妄图动摇党在农村的最可靠的支柱，搞垮无产阶级专政。对贫农的丑化和诽谤，不是同地主、资产阶级一个鼻孔出气吗？
    毛主席说：“农业合作化运动，从一开始，就是一种严重的思想的和政治的斗争。”党依靠广大贫下中农，团结中农，在合作化的道路上，同阶级敌人和资本主义自发势力进行了坚决的反复的斗争。可是，在这部影片里，根本没有表现广大贫下中农对资本主义自发势力的斗争。那个投机商人猫胡子，在光天化日之下，明目张胆大搞资本主义活动，无法无天，逍遥自在，始终无人过问。编导者对投机倒把分子这样宽容，这样优待，而对贫农却竭力歪曲，捏造了那个顽固地坚持走资本主义道路的高正国，妄图通过这个人物，把斗争的矛头指向革命的贫下中农，编导者居心的险恶，不是很清楚了么？
    《两家人》排斥和抹煞了党的领导，诽谤和丑化了贫农形象，歪曲了阶级斗争，这就从根本上否定了无产阶级专政和社会主义制度，从根本上否定了农业合作化运动，也就必然把农村现实和合作化运动描绘成漆黑一团。这是编导者对社会主义农村的恣意歪曲，对社会主义制度的恶毒攻击！
      《两家人》这部影片的改编和拍摄，是在党的八届十中全会之后的一九六三年。当时，农村已广泛开展了社会主义教育运动。八届十中全会这个具有伟大历史意义的会议，十分明确地阐述了在社会主义社会存在着阶级和阶级斗争，号召全党和全国人民不要忘记阶级斗争。在社会主义教育这个十分广泛而深刻的革命运动里，党中央提出要大树贫下中农优势，组织革命的阶级队伍，打退资本主义和封建势力的进攻。恰恰是在这个时候，影片《两家人》的编导者打着表现阶级斗争的旗号，猖狂地进行反党反社会主义的罪恶活动。《两家人》的出笼，正是我国尖锐的阶级斗争的反映。
      “蚍蜉撼树谈何易”！《两家人》对党对社会主义对贫下中农的诽谤和咒骂，丝毫无损于伟大的党和社会主义制度的光辉，只能暴露出这一小撮反党反社会主义分子的丑恶灵魂。从而激起工农兵群众的愤怒，彻底粉碎他们复辟资本主义的迷梦。
