A spokesman for the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Satellite Center announced on the 20th that the Soviet Union recently handed over its "most interesting" meteorological intelligence, obtained from artificial earth satellites, to the United States. This indicates that the collusion between the Soviet Union and the United States has further intensified.

This is the first time the Soviet Union has provided the United States with intelligence obtained from artificial satellites. The two countries originally had an agreement to exchange meteorological intelligence, but previously only exchanged ordinary meteorological information. This intelligence was provided through a special telegraph line called the "hotline" between Moscow and Washington. This line is called the "hotline" to distinguish it from another special telegraph line established by the Soviet Union and the United States to strengthen their collusion—a direct line between the Kremlin and the White House.

    苏美进一步加紧勾结
    苏向美提供人造卫星所获气象情报
    新华社二十一日讯  华盛顿消息：美国全国外空卫星中心的发言人二十日宣布，苏联最近把它从人造地球卫星获得的“最令人感兴趣”的气象情报，交给了美国。这表明，苏、美两国的勾结又进一步加紧。
    这是苏联第一次向美国提供从人造卫星获得的情报。苏美两国原订有交换气象情报的协定，但是以前只交换普通的气象情报。这份情报，是通过莫斯科和华盛顿之间的一条叫作“冷线”的特别电讯线路提供的。所以把这条线路叫作“冷线”，是为了区别于苏美两国为了加强勾结而建立的另一条特别电讯线路——在克里姆林宫和白宫之间的直通线路“热线”。
