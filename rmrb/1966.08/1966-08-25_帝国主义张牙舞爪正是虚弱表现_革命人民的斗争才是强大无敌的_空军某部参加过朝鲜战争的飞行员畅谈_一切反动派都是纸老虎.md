For the 20th anniversary of Chairman Mao's wise statement that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers, air force personnel from a certain unit who participated in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea held a symposium, enthusiastically discussing their deep understanding of Chairman Mao's wise statement that "all reactionaries are paper tigers."

Chairman Mao said: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They seem terrifying, but in reality, they have no great power. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries, but to the people." The heroes who fought against the American air pirates on the battlefield in Korea have the deepest understanding of this statement by Chairman Mao. They recalled that when they first took to the skies, they shattered the so-called "air superiority" that the American imperialists boasted about, scattering it like fallen flowers. They said: We dared to fight against American imperialism and all reactionaries because, following Chairman Mao's teachings, we despised them from their very essence. Hero of the First Class Wei Shuanglu said, at that time, we had only flown a few dozen hours, while our opponents, the American air pirates, had flown a thousand or two thousand hours and some had even participated in World War II. But our minds were clear. We firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings about how American imperialism is just an externally strong but internally weak paper tiger. We hated it, despised it, and resolutely fought against it. It quickly revealed its true form as a paper tiger. Through the battle, I truly felt that Chairman Mao's statement that "all reactionaries are paper tigers" is indeed an absolute truth. Hero of the First Class Liu Guomin and many other former volunteer air force heroes who fought against the tiger also used a large number of facts to illustrate: Chairman Mao's wise statement that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers is a model of analyzing problems from a long-term and essential perspective. It clearly tells us that imperialism is nothing to be afraid of. The atomic bomb can only scare those with weak nerves. The struggle of the revolutionary people is unstoppable and is the force that determines the course of history. Chairman Mao's brilliant statement has not only been proven by the victorious development of past and present revolutionary struggles but will also be proven by future victorious revolutionary struggles. Chairman Mao's great strategic thought is like a lighthouse, illuminating the path of victory for the revolutionary people of the world, inspiring people to dare to struggle and dare to win.

Chairman Mao taught us: "What determines the outcome of a war is the people, not one or two new weapons." The heroes who fought against the tiger used their own combat experiences to illustrate the wisdom and correctness of Chairman Mao's statement. They said, the reason American imperialism brandishes the atomic bomb so aggressively is precisely a reflection of its weak essence. It is detached from the people, has done countless evil deeds, and its spiritual world is extremely empty, so it relies on material things to boost its courage. Hero of the First Class Yang Wencong said, I have engaged with American air pirates many times and have seen these paper tigers' cowardly faces more than once. These pilots, flying the latest jet aircraft and undergoing long-term technical training, why do they sometimes appear so invincible and sometimes so panicked? It's not for any other reason, but because they are politically reactionary, decadent, and declining. They are timid in battle, and no matter how good the weapons are, they cannot be effective. But we are just, progressive, and full of vigor, so we are fearless. The two fundamentally different class essences determine that the enemy must be defeated, and we must be victorious.

Chairman Mao taught us: "In human history, any reactionary force that is about to perish will always make a final struggle against the revolutionary forces..."

The heroes, in their symposium, linked the current situation of American imperialism's frenzied expansion of the war of aggression in Vietnam, unanimously believing that, at present, although this paper tiger of American imperialism has been pierced full of holes by the Vietnamese people, it is still eating people and must be taken seriously.

    帝国主义张牙舞爪正是虚弱表现
    革命人民的斗争才是强大无敌的
    空军某部参加过朝鲜战争的飞行员畅谈“一切反动派都是纸老虎”
    据新华社二十三日讯　为纪念毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断发表二十周年，中国人民解放军空军某部参加过抗美援朝的飞行员，怀着十分兴奋的心情，举行座谈会，畅谈学习毛主席提出的关于“一切反动派都是纸老虎”这一英明论断的深切体会。
    毛主席说：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”当年在朝鲜战场上同美国飞贼较量过的打“虎”英雄们，对毛主席这一论述体会最深刻。他们回忆起自己刚刚飞上天空，就把美帝国主义吹嘘的所谓“空中优势”打得落花流水的情景时说：我们敢于和美帝国主义和一切反动派斗，就是因为按照毛主席的教导，从本质上藐视它。一等功臣魏双禄说，当时，我们只飞过几十个小时，而我们的对手美国空中强盗则是飞过一两千小时的老飞贼，他们有的还参加过第二次世界大战。但我们思想上一点不含糊。我们牢记着毛主席关于美帝国主义不过是一只外强中干的纸老虎的教导，仇视它，蔑视它，坚决同它干，它很快就现出了纸老虎的原形。通过战斗，我真正体会到毛主席说的“一切反动派都是纸老虎”，真是千真万确的真理。一等功臣刘国民和许多前志愿军空军打“虎”英雄们，还用大量事实说明：毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断，是从长远从本质分析问题的典范。它清楚地告诉我们，帝国主义没有什么可怕的，原子弹只能吓唬那些神经衰弱的人，革命人民的斗争才是不可阻挡的，是决定历史命运的力量。毛主席这一光辉论断，不仅已经为过去和现在的革命斗争的胜利发展所证实，而且还将为将来的胜利的革命斗争所证实。毛主席这一伟大战略思想正像灯塔一样，照亮世界革命人民胜利前进的道路，鼓舞着人们敢于斗争，敢于胜利。
    毛主席教导我们：“决定战争胜败的是人民，而不是一两件新式武器。”打“虎”英雄们用自己作战的大量事实说明毛主席这一论断的英明和正确。他们说，美帝国主义所以这样张牙舞爪地挥舞原子弹，恰恰是它虚弱本质的反映。它脱离人民，做尽了坏事，精神世界十分空虚，只好靠物来壮胆。一等功臣杨文聪说，我多次和美国空中强盗交过手，不只一次地看到过这些纸老虎的怯懦面目。这些驾着最新式喷气飞机，经过长期技术训练的飞贼，为什么气势一会儿那样不可一世，一会儿又那样慌张，不是别的，就是因为它们在政治上是反动的、腐朽的、没落的，它们在战斗中贪生怕死，再好的武器也不能发挥作用。而我们是正义的，进步的，朝气蓬勃的，因而是无所畏惧的。两种根本不同的阶级本质，决定了敌必败，我必胜。
    毛主席教导我们：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的……。”
    英雄们在座谈中，联系到当前美帝国主义在越南疯狂扩大侵略战争的情况，一致认为，目前，美帝国主义这只纸老虎虽然已经被越南人民戳得满身窟窿，但它还在吃人，必须认真对待。
