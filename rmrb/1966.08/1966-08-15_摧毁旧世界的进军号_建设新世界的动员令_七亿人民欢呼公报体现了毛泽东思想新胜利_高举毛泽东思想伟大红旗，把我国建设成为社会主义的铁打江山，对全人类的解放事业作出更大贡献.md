The mountains are cheering, the seas are laughing, the red sun is rising, and the bright lights are shining. The Party Central Committee has issued a communiqué! The communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which has epoch-making significance, has set off the strongest resonance in the vast land of our great motherland, like a thunderous spring thunder.

The billion people of the entire nation, with the most ardent revolutionary enthusiasm, enthusiastically cheer the issuance of the Party Central Committee's plenary session communiqué. From the heart of the country, Beijing, to the most remote villages, from the Tibetan Plateau to the islands in the South China Sea, along the banks of the Yangtze River and the Yellow River, the whole country is in jubilation. In many places, people stayed up all night, celebrating throughout the night. In many places, the entire city turned out, and the streets were packed with people celebrating the parade. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres across the country enthusiastically cheer the series of wise decisions made by Chairman Mao in the past four years, which fundamentally guarantee that our socialist revolution and socialist construction move from one victory to another, cheer the red milestone set by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, which was personally presided over by Chairman Mao, in the history of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, and cheer the new development and new great victory of Mao Zedong Thought embodied in the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee. People pointed out that the Party Central Committee's plenary session communiqué is a manifesto to carry the proletarian cultural revolution and socialist revolution to the end, a new marching order to thoroughly destroy the old world, and a new mobilization order to build a new world. People in various places unanimously expressed that they must firmly hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely and bravely carry out the combat tasks proposed in the communiqué, and strive to realize the Third Five-Year Plan and build our country into a powerful socialist state.

The communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee was broadcast simultaneously across the country yesterday. The vast land of the motherland immediately resonated with the slogans "Firmly support the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee," "Long live the great Communist Party of China," "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao," and "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought." In the capital and across the country, from yesterday to today, millions of people have taken to the streets, holding up large portraits of Chairman Mao, carrying huge banners with quotations from Chairman Mao, and holding red joyous bulletins and pledges, singing revolutionary songs such as "The East Is Red" and "The Ship of the Great Sea," dancing and singing, and surging to the streets to celebrate parades, celebrating all night long, surging to the Party Central Committee and local Party committees to congratulate, expressing their most resolute and enthusiastic support for the communiqué. At the reception station of the CPC Central Committee, since the issuance of the communiqué until tonight, the number of revolutionary masses who have come to congratulate has reached 200,000. The responsible comrades of the CPC Central Committee and the responsible comrades of the Party committees of various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions enthusiastically received the revolutionary masses who came to congratulate, and together with the masses, shouted: "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"

The celebrations over the past two days have most vividly expressed the unlimited trust of the 700 million people of the entire nation in our great Party, and expressed their unlimited love, respect, and admiration for our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought. During the celebration parades, in some places where it happened to be pouring rain, people took off their clothes to cover the portraits of Chairman Mao. In many places, people read Chairman Mao's quotations aloud collectively while parading. In many places, people created one song after another and performed one after another song and dance performances, praising our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. A liberated serf in Tibet exclaimed after the issuance of the communiqué: "The great Mao Zedong Thought is more precious than the sun. The sun can only warm our bodies, while Mao Zedong Thought illuminates our hearts." People pointed out that our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao leads us from one victory to another, and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought illuminates our way forward. Forever following Chairman Mao, holding high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, we will definitely be able to build our great motherland into an unshakable socialist iron fortress, and the 700 million people of our country will definitely be able to make greater contributions to the liberation of all mankind.
