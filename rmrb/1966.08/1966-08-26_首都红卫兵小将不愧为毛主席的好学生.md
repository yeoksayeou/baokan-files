To the Red Guards of the Capital:

You, the Red Guards of the capital, have taken Mao Zedong Thought as your guide and the Sixteen Points as your weapon. You have carried forward the spirit of revolutionary rebellion of the proletariat. You fear neither heaven nor earth, you do not fear ghosts, and you do not believe in superstition. You have launched a fierce attack on the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes. We are extremely pleased. We are inspired by your revolutionary spirit and cheer for your revolutionary actions: You are right, you are doing well, very well! You are truly good students of Chairman Mao.

To the Red Guards of the Capital:

We are the revolutionary workers of Jiangnan Machinery Factory, the hometown of Chairman Mao. We firmly support your revolutionary actions and stand resolutely on your side. We will forever fight alongside you, eliminate all harmful elements, remove all obstacles, and resolutely carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end! Carry the socialist revolution to the end!

Long live the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat!

Long live the spirit of revolutionary rebellion of the proletariat!

Long live the invincible and great Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live the Communist Party of China!

Long live the greatest leader, the greatest commander, and the greatest helmsman, Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!

The Revolutionary Workers of State-owned Jiangnan Machinery Factory
