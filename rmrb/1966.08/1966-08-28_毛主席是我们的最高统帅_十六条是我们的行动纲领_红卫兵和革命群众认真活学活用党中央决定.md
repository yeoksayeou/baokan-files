Red Guards and revolutionary masses earnestly study and apply the Party Central Committee's decision

	Newspaper report, August 27th: Red Guards from all over the country, along with the broad masses of workers, peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals, are continuing to launch a fierce attack on all old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits with the momentum of a thunderbolt. In this unprecedented revolutionary struggle, they are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to arm themselves with the decision of the Party Central Committee on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which was personally presided over by Chairman Mao, and to earnestly study, familiarize themselves with, master, and apply the Sixteen Points. Through struggle, they will become even stronger.

	Since the Red Guards in the capital took the lead in sweeping the "four olds" off the streets, this revolutionary storm has swept across all cities in the country in just a few days. The broad masses of workers, peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals have quickly united with the Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students in various places, forming a mighty torrent that is washing away all old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits, creating a vibrant revolutionary scene across the country. All the ghosts and monsters and old forces that attempt to block this revolutionary storm have been struck a heavy blow. As the struggle to sweep the "four olds" continues to develop more broadly and deeply, the Red Guards and revolutionary masses in various places are more determined than ever. They have expressed that in the struggle, they will definitely study and apply the Sixteen Points, actively propagate the Sixteen Points, and make all their actions guided by the Sixteen Points. Red Guards in various places have also emphasized that in the struggle, they must further carry forward the revolutionary spirit of "daring to be the first," daring to break through all obstacles from any direction, to the greatest extent possible isolating those anti-party and anti-socialist elements and all ghosts and monsters, giving them a devastating blow, and carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

	In Tianjin, some schools' Red Guards carry the Sixteen Points with them every day as they go out to sweep the "four olds," studying and propagating them at any time and place. They say, the Sixteen Points were personally presided over by our great helmsman Chairman Mao and are the crystallization of the experience of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must definitely master this great spiritual weapon and smash the strongholds of the bourgeoisie to pieces, disrupting the old rules, old systems, and old order of the bourgeoisie. They also say, anyone who resists the Sixteen Points, we will oppose, we will overthrow, we will expose, we will criticize, and we will struggle against. We are determined to follow Chairman Mao in making revolution, to rebel against the bourgeoisie, to rebel against imperialism, to rebel against revisionism, to rebel against all ghosts and monsters, and to rebel against all ideologies of the exploiting classes, creating a brand-new world of the proletariat. Currently, the struggle to sweep the "four olds" in Tianjin is continuing to develop broadly and deeply. Over 4,000 retail stores in the city have changed their old names to new ones with revolutionary significance. The revolutionary workers of the Tanggu Customs, inspired by the revolutionary spirit of the Red Guards, have smashed the old customs hats of imperialism, and the badges, armbands, and copper buttons with feudal, capitalist, and revisionist colors have been smashed to pieces.

	The revolutionary storm to break the "four olds" and establish the "four news" in Shanghai is also continuing to develop in depth. The appearance of many streets has been completely renewed, many stores have changed to new signs with revolutionary significance, and the display windows have been completely redesigned, hanging up portraits of Chairman Mao and quotations from Chairman Mao. Red Guards from universities and middle schools have continued to beat drums and sing battle songs in the past two days, surging onto the streets to loudly propagate the great significance of breaking the "four olds" and establishing the "four news," and loudly propagate the Sixteen Points. In some theaters, after obtaining the consent of the troupe, the Red Guards went on stage to propagate the Sixteen Points, receiving enthusiastic praise from the audience, actors, and revolutionary workers.

	The Red Guards in the heroic city of Nanchang have been posting revolutionary leaflets, big-character posters, and making speeches in various places across the city in the past few days, declaring war on the "four olds." They pointed out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a new stage of deeper and broader development of the socialist revolution in our country. This revolution is to eliminate bourgeois ideology, promote proletarian ideology, transform people's souls, achieve the proletarianization of people's thinking, uproot the roots of revisionism, consolidate and develop the socialist system, and establish Mao Zedong Thought. We must let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all ideological positions and use Mao Zedong Thought to change the spiritual face of the entire society. Their declaration has been enthusiastically supported by the revolutionary masses. Now the streets of Nanchang have been renewed, and many road names and store names with feudal, capitalist, and revisionist colors have been changed to revolutionary new names.

	In the past few days, the Red Guard warriors in Nanjing have taken to the streets, launching a powerful revolutionary offensive against the "four olds" with the revolutionary spirit of "sweeping a thousand troops like rolling up a mat." On the walls of the main streets in the city, there are revolutionary declarations from the Red Guards everywhere. They wrote: Nanjing is an ancient city. Before liberation, it was the political center of the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits left over from thousands of years, and all those messy things, are deeply rooted. After liberation, the exploiting classes were overthrown, but their ghosts do not disperse. Many street names, road names, store names, and the names of shopping malls, theaters, hotels, etc., still have a strong feudal, capitalist color. We see them and our hearts burn with anger! We can no longer tolerate it! We must carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, sweep away all the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes, smash the old world, and build a new world. With the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of workers, the Red Guards have already changed those old road names, old store names, and old school names that smell of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, replacing them with new names that propagate Mao Zedong Thought and reflect the spirit of the socialist era.

	In the capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Hohhot, revolutionary workers of various ethnic groups enthusiastically support the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards and revolutionary students in sweeping the "four olds." Many Red Guards, full of revolutionary enthusiasm, said: Our supreme commander is Chairman Mao, our battle song is the "Revolutionary Rebellion Song," our fighting style is the Three-Eight Style, and our fighting task is to struggle, criticize, and transform. We must carry forward the great fearless revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, dare to make revolution, dare to struggle, and dare to win. The Sixteen Points are our action guideline. We must earnestly study the Sixteen Points, familiarize ourselves with the Sixteen Points, master the Sixteen Points, and apply the Sixteen Points, carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

	In the past few days, tens of thousands of Red Guards have also taken to the streets in the cities of Guiyang and Zunyi in Guizhou Province, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to sweep the "four olds." Red Guards from many schools in Guiyang have posted countless declarations challenging the old world on the streets and alleys of the city, pointing out that the influence of the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits left over from thousands of years of the exploiting classes is very deep. To thoroughly eliminate these things, we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, take up the revolutionary broom, and sweep them away. We must rise up with the revolutionary iron rod, smashing the remnants of the old world to pieces, letting Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions, and using Mao Zedong Thought to change the spiritual face of the entire society. The revolutionary actions of the Red Guards have been enthusiastically supported by the broad revolutionary masses. Their actions have made the bourgeoisie lose face, and the revolutionary people are greatly inspired.

    天津市一些学校的红卫兵们，每天上街横扫“四旧”时，都随身带着十六条，随时随地进行学习和宣传。他们说，十六条是我们的伟大革命舵手毛主席亲自主持制定的，是无产阶级文化大革命的经验结晶。我们一定要好好掌握这个伟大的精神武器，把资产阶级的顽固堡垒打它个落花流水，把资产阶级的旧章法、旧规矩、旧秩序统统打乱。他们还说，凡是抵制十六条的，我们就要反对，就要打倒，就要揭发，就要批判，就要斗争。我们决心跟着毛主席闹革命，造资产阶级的反，造帝国主义的反，造修正主义的反，造一切牛鬼蛇神的反，造一切剥削阶级意识形态的反，反出一个崭新的无产阶级的新世界来。目前天津市横扫“四旧”的斗争正在继续广泛深入发展，全市四千多个百货副食品商店门市部，其中需要改换的旧名称已全部改为富有革命意义的新店名。塘沽海关的革命职工，在红卫兵革命造反精神鼓舞下，砸烂了帝国主义旧海关的大沿帽，把带有封建主义、资本主义、修正主义色彩的图案的关徽、臂章和铜钮扣砸得稀烂。
    上海市破“四旧”、立“四新”的革命风暴，也正在继续向纵深发展。许多街道的面貌已经焕然一新，许多商店换上了具有革命意义的新招牌，橱窗都做了全新布置，挂上了毛主席画像和毛主席语录。来自大中学校的红卫兵们，这两天继续擂战鼓，唱战歌，涌上街头大张旗鼓地宣传破“四旧”立“四新”的伟大意义，大张旗鼓地宣传十六条。在有些剧场里，红卫兵们在征得剧团同意后，登上舞台宣传十六条，博得观众、演员和革命职工的热烈赞扬。
