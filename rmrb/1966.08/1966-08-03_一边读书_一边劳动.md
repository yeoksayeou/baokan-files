Our agricultural middle school follows Chairman Mao's teachings, adhering to the principle of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor." We have gradually achieved the goal of studying while working. Currently, students learn subjects such as plant protection, horticulture, mechanics, carpentry, sprayer repair, kiln firing, cotton ginning, papermaking, weaving, as well as military and health-related topics. Teachers and students work for half a day and study for half a day, engaging in agricultural work during busy seasons and industrial and sideline work during slack periods. Over the past three years, students have acquired various production skills and military knowledge, determined to become versatile individuals who are both workers and farmers, both intellectuals and soldiers, with socialist consciousness and cultural knowledge.

For thousands of years, old intellectuals have followed the path of "learning for officialdom," believing that after studying, one should detach from labor and become spiritual aristocrats above the laboring masses. The more they read, the more they look down on laborers. Following this path, the gap between physical labor and mental labor will only widen. In contrast, our agricultural middle school students study while working, receiving comprehensive training. This breaks the old notion that those who study cannot engage in physical labor, beginning to combine physical and mental labor in these students.

Through labor, the thoughts and feelings of teachers and students have undergone significant changes. Some students who once thought it shameful to carry a bamboo basket to the market now can walk barefoot with a pole on their shoulders, holding their heads high on the streets. One student from a laboring family once thought that after studying, one could avoid labor. Later, after working with poor and lower-middle peasants, he developed a bond with them and realized that despising labor is shameful and a product of the exploiting class's ideology.

Students, through studying and working simultaneously, have learned various skills. Now, many students have mastered seed selection, transplanting, harvesting, pest control, using fertilizers and pesticides, and have also learned military knowledge and combat skills, such as shooting, grenade throwing, swimming, and air raid precautions. The health class has also achieved the goal of serving the laboring masses in peacetime and being ready for war.

These students, upon returning to the countryside, have become versatile new-type laborers. They can farm with a hoe, work with tools, fight with a gun, and write with a pen, truly becoming all-round individuals. They have received high praise from the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants upon returning to the production frontline. Community members praise graduates of agricultural middle schools, saying, "They can get by in the countryside, get along with poor and lower-middle peasants, have no airs, and are truly Chairman Mao's good successors." A poor peasant student's parent, seeing these students who are both literate and skilled, was very happy. He said, "In the past, I worried that these children, after studying, would not love labor; now, seeing these children in agricultural middle schools, not only have they studied but also learned labor skills and understand military knowledge, this is good, we are at ease, and the roots of revisionism can be thoroughly uprooted."

Practice has proven that agricultural middle schools, by studying and working simultaneously, have found a broad path for our young generation to achieve both physical and mental labor, gradually narrowing the three major gaps. We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, steadfastly walk this path. We must unremittingly struggle against all outdated notions that separate education from labor, resolutely implement the Party's educational policy, and turn our schools into revolutionary schools that cultivate new communist individuals.

    一边读书　一边劳动
    江苏省东台县时埝农业中学副校长　刘锋
    我们农业中学遵照毛主席的教导，坚持“教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动结合”的方针，逐步做到了一边读书，一边劳动。现在，学生学习的内容有：植物保护、园艺、机电、木工、喷雾器修理、烧窑、轧花、造纸、编织以及军事、卫生等项。师生们半天劳动，半天学习，农忙务农，农闲搞工业和副业。三年来，学生们都学会了一些生产本领和军事知识，决心锻炼成为亦工亦农，亦文亦武，有社会主义觉悟、有文化知识的劳动者。
    几千年来，旧知识分子都是走着“学而优则仕”的道路，认为读了书，就要脱离劳动，成为高踞于劳动人民之上的精神贵族。他们读的书愈多，愈是瞧不起劳动人民。沿着这条道路走下去，体力劳动和脑力劳动之间的差别，只会越来越大。与此相反，我们农业中学的学生，一边读书，一边劳动，受到了全面锻炼，这就打破了几千年来认为读了书就不能参加体力劳动的旧观念，使体力劳动与脑力劳动在这些学生身上开始结合起来。
    通过劳动，师生的思想感情起了很大变化。有些原来连提个竹篮子上街都认为不光彩的学生，现在也能赤脚挑担，昂首阔步在大街上走。有个劳动人民家庭出身的学生，原来认为读了书，可以不参加劳动。后来，他和贫下中农一起劳动，同贫下中农有了感情，认识到鄙视劳动是可耻的，是剥削阶级的思想意识。
    学生们通过一边读书，一边劳动，学到了多方面的本领。现在，不少学生学会了选种、栽秧、收割、治虫、使用化肥、农药，还学到了军事知识和打仗的本领，会射击，会投弹，会游泳，会防空。卫生班还做到了平时为劳动人民服务，战时能为战争服务。
    这些学生回到农村，都成为一专多能、亦文亦武的新型劳动者。他们扛起锄头会种田，拿起工具能做工，拿起枪来会打仗，抓起笔杆会写文章，真正成了全面发展的人。他们回到生产第一线，获得了广大贫下中农的好评。社员称赞农中毕业生“在农村过得来，与贫下中农合得来，没有一点‘洋’气，真是毛主席的好后代。”有个贫农学生家长看到这些学生能文能武，非常高兴。他说：“过去担心这些孩子读了书，不爱劳动；现在看到这些孩子在农业中学里，既读了书，又学会了劳动的本领，还懂得军事知识，这下子好了，我们放心了，修正主义的根子就能被彻底挖掉了。”
    实践证明，农业中学一边读书，一边劳动，为我们青年一代实现既能体力劳动又能脑力劳动，逐步缩小三大差别，找到了一条宽广的道路。我们一定要按照毛主席的指示，坚定不移地沿着这条道路走下去。我们一定跟那些使教育与劳动分离的形形色色的陈腐观念作不懈的斗争，坚决执行党的教育方针，把我们的学校办成革命化的学校，办成培养共产主义新人的学校。
