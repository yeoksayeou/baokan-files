Recently, the Changzhou Forestry Machinery Factory in Jiangsu Province has developed a new type of internal combustion rock drill. This rock drill is convenient to carry, easy to start, and is a highly suitable new tool for road construction, mining, forest development, and mountain area construction in our country.

This internal combustion rock drill is a handheld tool weighing only about thirty kilograms. According to trials, two people operating it can drill a hole six meters and two decimeters deep in rock within two and a half hours. In contrast, three people using manual methods to drill a hole of the same depth would take five to six days. With the help of sister units, Changzhou Forestry Machinery Factory completed this product in just over nine months.

    筑路开矿建设山区利器
    常州制成新型内燃凿岩机
    江苏常州林业机械厂最近制成一种新型内燃凿岩机。这种内燃凿岩机，携带方便，起动容易，是我国筑路、开矿、开发林区和建设山区的一种非常适用的新型工具。
    这种内燃凿岩机是一种手持作业工具，全重只有三十多公斤。据试用，两个人操作，只要两个多小时就可以在岩石上钻孔六米二深，而由三个人用人工打同样深的孔，却要五六天时间。常州林业机械厂在兄弟单位的帮助下，只用了九个多月就制成了这一产品。
