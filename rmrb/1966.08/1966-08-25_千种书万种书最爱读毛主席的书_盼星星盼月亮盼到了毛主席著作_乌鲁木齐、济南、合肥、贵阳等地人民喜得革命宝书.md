Among ten thousand books, we love reading Chairman Mao's books the most. We have waited for the stars and the moon, and now we have finally received the works of Chairman Mao. The people of Urumqi, Jinan, Hefei, Guiyang, and other places are overjoyed to have obtained these revolutionary treasures.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, August 24th – On August 20th, the staff of the Xinhua Bookstore in Urumqi beat drums and gongs, using decorated vehicles to deliver "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in Uyghur, Kazakh, and Chinese to more than ten colleges and universities, including Xinjiang University and Xinjiang Agricultural University. Revolutionary teachers and students of various ethnic groups held up portraits of Chairman Mao and bouquets, lining the streets to welcome the arrival, with drums beating and cheers echoing. On this day, more than ten thousand teachers and students bought "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and more than seven hundred graduating students of various ethnic groups bought the first four volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." They were overjoyed and shouted in different ethnic languages: "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!"

Some students at Xinjiang University, after receiving the beautifully bound "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in Uyghur and Kazakh, excitedly said: Chairman Mao's shining golden book is the eternal red sun in the hearts of all ethnic groups. We will carry "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with us, keep Chairman Mao's words in our hearts, and put them into action. We are determined to carry out the Cultural Revolution to the end according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Revolutionary students of various ethnic groups at Urumqi High School, after receiving "Quotations from Chairman Mao," solemnly swore in front of Chairman Mao's statue: We will always listen to Chairman Mao's words, read Chairman Mao's books, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We will be good students of Chairman Mao.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, August 23rd – The newly published "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" began to be widely distributed in Jinan on August 18th, with 38,000 copies sold on the first day. When the Xinhua Bookstore's decorated vehicle loaded with "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" entered Shandong University, the campus was filled with joy, drums beating, firecrackers exploding, and the slogans "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" along with songs like "The East Is Red" and "The Great Ship Navigates the Seas" echoed through the sky. Revolutionary teachers and students held a solemn ceremony in the campus square to receive "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Many revolutionary teachers and students from Shandong Normal University, Shandong Institute of Technology, and Shandong Institute of Finance preemptively bought new red cloth and handkerchiefs on the streets to wrap the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" they received, holding them high and cheering loudly to express their boundless respect for Chairman Mao's works. Five Good Soldiers of the Eighth Company of a certain unit of the Shandong Provincial Military Region, Teng Shulin, were extremely excited when they bought "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," saying: "Chairman Mao's books are the treasures of the revolution, the compass, and the lifeline. I will use Mao Zedong Thought to arm my mind and train my combat skills."

Throughout the book-buying process, revolutionary teachers, students, and staff from various schools sang songs such as "The East Is Red," "The Great Ship Navigates the Seas," and "I Love Reading Chairman Mao's Books." Hefei Normal University Chinese literature student Shi Jingli, after obtaining a brand-new "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," immediately wrote a poem: Chairman Mao's works shine with golden light, illuminating my heart brightly. With you, my heart is clear, my eyes are bright, and my bones are strong. I dare to climb the mountain of knives and leap into the sea of fire! With the revolution's compass, I am not afraid of a level-12 typhoon, not afraid of towering waves; Chairman Mao, our most beloved teacher, a bright red sun, I will read your books and follow your words for a lifetime, letting the red flag of the revolution fly high forever!

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, August 23rd – In recent days, nearly 100,000 people in Guiyang have bought locally printed "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and "Selected Readings from Mao Zedong's Works."

They say: "Among the thousands of books in the bookstore, we love reading Chairman Mao's books the most; we have waited for the stars and the moon, and today we have finally received 'Quotations from Chairman Mao.'" Students from Guiyang Girls' Middle School created a dance titled "Chairman Mao's Works Have Been Distributed" at the bookstore's entrance and performed it on the spot for the purchasing crowds, expressing their boundless love, faith, and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao.
