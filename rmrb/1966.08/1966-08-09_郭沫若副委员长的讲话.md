Comrades and friends,

Three years ago today, our most beloved leader Chairman Mao Zedong issued the "Statement in Support of the American Black People's Just Struggle Against Racial Discrimination by American Imperialism." Today, as the American Black people's struggle against racial discrimination is surging to new heights, the people of various circles in our capital are holding this rally to solemnly commemorate the third anniversary of Chairman Mao's statement. This has important practical significance. First of all, let us express our highest respect, firm support, and heartfelt greetings to our American Black brothers who, despite the savage suppression and persecution by American imperialism, are bravely fighting against racial discrimination.

Chairman Mao's statement has had a profound political impact and great historical significance. Chairman Mao's statement is a great call to arms against American imperialism's racial discrimination. Chairman Mao's statement has greatly boosted the morale of American Black people. The entire Chinese people resolutely support it! The American people, especially American Black people, enthusiastically respond to it! The people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America actively support it! People around the world enthusiastically praise it! They say: Chairman Mao's statement has brought hope to American Black people, "like a torch lighting up the hearts of all Black people"! They say: Chairman Mao's statement has pointed out the correct path and direction for American Black people and all oppressed nations and peoples to struggle for independence, freedom, and liberation!

Over the past three years, the facts of the American Black people's struggle against racial discrimination have fully proven that the judgments in Chairman Mao's statement are completely correct and are unshakable truths; they have fully proven that Mao Zedong Thought is the contemporary Marxism-Leninism and the sharpest weapon against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries.

Chairman Mao said: The American Black people are awakening, and their resistance is becoming more intense. Chairman Mao pointed out with great depth that the class contradictions and national contradictions within the United States have become increasingly sharp.

Over the past three years, the storm of the American Black people's struggle has swept across the entire United States from south to north and from east to west. In 1963, 250,000 people from all over the United States marched on Washington. In 1964, Black people in the Harlem district of New York City launched the first violent self-defense struggle. In 1965, Black people in the Watts district of Los Angeles launched an even more intense armed resistance struggle. The waves of the American Black people's struggle have risen higher and higher. Since the beginning of this summer, in major cities such as Chicago, New York, San Francisco, and Cleveland, armed resistance struggles by Black people have continued. Black people, armed with bricks, tiles, Molotov cocktails, and guns, have engaged in prolonged and fierce battles with thousands of police and soldiers sent to suppress them. This struggle has made the American reactionary ruling clique very frightened and disheveled.

The American Black people, fearless of violence and unafraid of sacrifice, have waged a brave and relentless struggle, writing a heroic epic. The American Black people's spirit of daring to struggle is a great inspiration to all oppressed peoples and nations. The Chinese people cheer for the brave struggle of our American Black brothers!

Chairman Mao said: National struggle, in the final analysis, is a class struggle. Chairman Mao pointed out with great clarity the essence of the American Black people's struggle.

The American Black people live at the bottom of the rotten capitalist society of the United States. The heavy shackles of profit extraction by American monopolies first fall on the broad masses of American Black people. They are the greatest bearers of all the disasters of poverty, unemployment, and taxes. For a long time, American Black people have suffered the most brutal economic exploitation and the most barbaric political oppression. The American ruling class incites racial discrimination and oppresses American Black people, which, in the final analysis, is class oppression, determined by the interests of the American monopolist bourgeoisie. Where there is oppression, there is resistance. The more brutal the oppression, the more intense the resistance. The facts have proven that the exploited and oppressed American Black people are the most resolute and reliable revolutionary force in the United States.

As Chairman Mao pointed out: In the United States, it is only the reactionary ruling clique among the white race that oppresses Black people. They cannot represent the majority of workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and other enlightened people among the white race. This also embodies a truth that Chairman Mao often teaches us: "Who is our enemy? Who is our friend? This is the primary question of the revolution." Revolutionary American Black people are finding the answer to this question through their struggle. The American Black people are increasingly clearly directing their struggle against the American reactionary ruling clique, which powerfully illustrates this point.

The American reactionary ruling clique is terrified of the raging struggle of the American Black people. On the one hand, they have carried out maddened fascist suppression against the American Black people's struggle. On the other hand, they use deception to dull the fighting spirit of the American Black people, blur the class boundaries of the American Black people, and shift the direction of the American Black people's struggle. However, the American Black people who have grown through struggle have their class consciousness constantly rising. They cannot be deceived or intimidated. The American reactionary ruling clique's various attempts to extinguish the flames of the American Black people's struggle are all in vain and are doomed to fail miserably.

Chairman Mao said that American imperialism's fascist atrocities against Black people have exposed the essence of American so-called democracy and freedom and revealed the internal connection between the American government's reactionary policies at home and its aggressive policies abroad.

To deceive, the American reactionary ruling clique advocates things like the "Civil Rights Act," the "War on Poverty," and "non-violent civil rights struggle," talking nonsense. However, the actions of the American ruling clique always completely expose their deception. The facts have proven that everything they say is false, while their police, military, and prisons are real. Like all reactionary ruling classes in history, the American reactionary ruling clique has always relied on violence to maintain its rule. Therefore, the American Black people must use violence to resist the American reactionary ruling clique. Over the past three years, the American Black people's struggle has increasingly taken the correct path of revolutionary violence against counter-revolutionary violence. This marks the American Black people's struggle entering a new stage.

The facts of the past three years have also powerfully proven that the more American imperialism wants to escalate its aggressive and war policies, especially to expand its aggression against Vietnam, the more it will intensify its attacks on the American people, especially the American Black people. American imperialism's expansion of the war in Vietnam not only brings deep disasters to the Vietnamese people but also brings conscription, increased taxes, inflation, and fascist persecution to the American people, especially the American Black people. American imperialism is not only the most vicious enemy of the Vietnamese people and the people of the world but also the most vicious enemy of the American people.

In the struggle against American imperialism's aggressive and war policies, the people of the world and the American people stand together, always sympathizing with and supporting each other. The Vietnamese people are fiercely striking American imperialism on the battlefield, which is a powerful support for the struggle of the American Black people. Similarly, the American Black people's struggle against American imperialism's racial discrimination is a major support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation. Over the past three years, our American Black brothers have resolutely opposed American imperialism's expansion of the war in Vietnam, refused to serve in the military, burned draft cards, and combined the struggle against political and economic oppression with the movement against American imperialism's aggression against Vietnam. They have done well and done right! We are deeply convinced that to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation and to fight for their own freedom and equal rights, the American Black brothers with a glorious tradition of struggle will, with the support of the American people and the people of the world, certainly act more actively and push the struggle against violence to a new height.

Comrades and friends, in the struggle of the people of the world against American imperialism, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique has acted as the number one accomplice of American imperialism in every way. They have never supported the struggle of our American Black brothers against American imperialism. They absurdly call the correct stance of supporting national liberation movements "substituting the class struggle viewpoint with the racial viewpoint" to cover up their betrayal activities. On the Vietnam issue, they do not hesitate to sell out the interests of the Vietnamese people and strive to serve American imperialism. They collude with American imperialism to push the "bombing for peace" conspiracy, turning Moscow into an exchange for American imperialism to sell the conspiracy of peace talks. They indulge American imperialism's aggressive policies abroad and thus support American imperialism's reactionary policies at home. They not only act as accomplices of American imperialism's expansion of aggressive wars but also place themselves in the shameful position of helping American imperialism attack the American people and the American Black people.

Chairman Mao has long pointed out that American imperialism is a paper tiger. It is already in a desperate and disheveled situation both at home and abroad. The oppressed peoples and nations of the world are all against American imperialism. American imperialism is like sitting on a volcano. The current struggle of the American Black people makes American imperialism tremble with fear and sit uneasily. The days of American imperialism are numbered.

In the great revolutionary situation of "the seas churning with waves and the continents shaking with thunder," our current most important task is to form the broadest and most genuine international united front against American imperialism. This front includes the broad masses of American Black people and the American people, all oppressed peoples and nations of the world, and all countries and peoples invaded, controlled, interfered with, and bullied by American imperialism, but it absolutely cannot include the running dogs and accomplices of American imperialism. The Soviet modern revisionist leadership clique is willing to serve the Americans and uses the so-called "united action" as a cover to try to sabotage this genuine anti-American united front. Recently, at the 12th World Conference to Ban the Bomb held in Japan, the Soviet revisionist clique once again carried out sabotage activities, stuffing the conference with the delegation of the World Federation of Democratic Youth controlled by them. To protest this action, representatives from 16 countries announced their withdrawal from this conference. Some of these representatives have already arrived in Beijing and participated in our rally today. Let us express our warm welcome to them! The Chinese people fully support their principled and just stance. This also once again shows that to oppose American imperialism, we must oppose modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership clique. The eyes of the revolutionary people of the world are getting brighter and brighter, and American imperialism and its accomplices, no matter what tricks they play, will not succeed.

Comrades and friends, three years ago, Chairman Mao said in his statement, "With the support of more than 90% of the people of the world, the just struggle of the American Black people is bound to win. The evil system of colonialism and imperialism, which rose with the enslavement and trafficking of Black people, will also come to an end with the complete liberation of the Black race." Chairman Mao's prophecy will certainly be realized.

The Chinese people are friendly with the American people, and the Chinese people are the most reliable friends of the American Black people. In your struggle, you will always receive the boundless sympathy and active support of the Chinese people. We are deeply convinced that the American Black brothers will certainly unite more closely, join forces with all oppressed peoples and nations, form the broadest united front, and wage a struggle against American imperialism. You will certainly win! You will certainly be liberated!

Finally, let us shout:

Down with American imperialism!

Victory to the American Black people!

Victory to the American people!

Victory to the people of the world!

Long live Chairman Mao!

### 郭沫若副委员长的讲话

1966-08-09
第3版()
专栏：

    在首都各界人民反对美帝国主义、支持美国黑人反对种族歧视斗争大会上
    郭沫若副委员长的讲话同志们，朋友们：
    三年前的今天，我们最敬爱的领袖毛泽东主席，发表了《支持美国黑人反对美帝国主义种族歧视正义斗争的声明》。今天，当美国黑人反对种族歧视的正义斗争正在进入一个新的高涨的时候，我们首都各界人民，在这里举行集会，隆重纪念毛主席发表这篇声明的三周年，具有重要的现实意义。首先让我们对于不顾美帝国主义的野蛮镇压和迫害，正在为反对种族歧视英勇斗争的美国黑人兄弟，表示崇高的敬意、坚决的支持和衷心的慰问。
    毛主席的声明有着深远的政治影响和重大的历史意义。毛主席的声明是反对美帝国主义种族歧视的伟大战斗号召。毛主席的声明极大地鼓舞了美国黑人的斗志。全中国人民坚决地拥护它！美国人民，特别是美国黑人热烈地响应它！亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的人民积极地支持它！全世界人民热情地歌颂它！他们说：毛主席的声明，给美国黑人“带来了希望”，“象火炬一样照亮了所有黑人的心”！他们说：毛主席的声明，为美国黑人和一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民指出了争取独立、自由和解放的正确道路和方向！
    三年来，美国黑人反对种族歧视斗争的活生生的事实，充分证明了毛主席声明中的论断是完全正确的，是颠扑不破的真理；充分证明了毛泽东思想是当代的马克思列宁主义，是反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的最锐利的武器。
    毛主席说：美国黑人正在觉醒，他们的反抗日益强烈。毛主席极其深刻地指出了美国国内的阶级矛盾和民族矛盾已经日益尖锐化。
    三年来，美国黑人斗争的风暴从南到北，从东到西，席卷了整个美国。一九六三年，来自美国各地的二十五万群众举行了“向华盛顿进军”。一九六四年，纽约市哈莱姆区的黑人揭开了黑人暴力自卫斗争的序幕。一九六五年，洛杉矶市瓦茨区的黑人掀起了更为激烈的武装抗暴斗争。美国黑人斗争的浪潮，彼伏此起，一浪高过一浪。今年入夏以来，在芝加哥、纽约、旧金山和克利夫兰等重要城市，黑人武装抗暴斗争连续不断。黑人群众用砖头、瓦块、燃烧瓶和枪枝，同前往镇压的数以千计的警察和军队，展开了长时间的剧烈搏斗。这个斗争使美国反动统治集团十分惊慌，十分狼狈。
    美国黑人不畏强暴，不怕牺牲，进行了英勇顽强、再接再厉的斗争，写下了可歌可泣的诗篇。美国黑人这种敢于斗争的大无畏精神是对一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族的极大鼓舞。中国人民为美国黑人兄弟的英勇斗争而欢呼！
    毛主席说：民族斗争，说到底，是一个阶级斗争问题。毛主席非常透彻地指出了美国黑人斗争的实质。
    美国黑人生活在腐朽透顶的美国资本主义社会的最底层。美国垄断资本榨取利润的沉重枷锁，首先落在美国广大黑人的身上。他们是贫困、失业、捐税等这一切灾难的最大承担者。长期以来，美国黑人受到最残酷的经济剥削和最野蛮的政治压迫。美国统治阶级煽动种族歧视，压迫美国黑人，归根到底是阶级迫害，是美国垄断资产阶级的利益决定的。哪里有压迫，哪里就有反抗，哪里的压迫最残酷，哪里的反抗就最剧烈。事实证明被剥削被压迫的美国黑人是美国最坚决最可靠的革命力量。
    正如毛主席所指出的：在美国压迫黑人的，只是白色人种中的反动统治集团。他们绝不能代表白色人种中占绝大多数的工人、农民、革命的知识分子和其他开明人士。这里也体现了毛主席经常教导我们的一条真理：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”革命的美国黑人，正在通过斗争实践，找到这个问题的答案。美国黑人越来越明显地把斗争的矛头指向美国的反动统治集团，有力地说明了这一点。
    美国的反动统治集团，对如火如荼的美国黑人斗争，害怕得要死。一方面他们对美国黑人斗争进行了疯狂的法西斯镇压。另一方面，他们采取欺骗手法，来麻痹美国黑人的斗志，模糊美国黑人的阶级界限，转移美国黑人的斗争方向。但是，从斗争中成长起来的美国黑人，他们的阶级觉悟不断提高，他们是骗不了，也是吓不倒的。美国反动统治集团千方百计地企图扑灭美国黑人斗争的烈火，都是枉费心机，注定要遭到可耻的失败。
    毛主席说，美帝国主义对黑人的法西斯暴行，揭穿了美国的所谓民主和自由的本质，暴露了美国政府在国内的反动政策和在国外的侵略政策之间的内在联系。
    为了进行欺骗，美国反动统治集团鼓吹什么“民权法案”、什么“向贫穷宣战计划”、什么“非暴力民权斗争”，说得天花乱坠。但是美国统治集团的所作所为，总是把他们进行欺骗的一手彻底揭穿。事实证明，他们口里所说的，统统是假的，而他们的警察、军队、监狱才是真的。同历史上一切反动统治阶级一样，美国的反动统治集团，历来都是依靠暴力来维持它的统治的。因此，美国黑人必然要用暴力来反抗美国反动统治集团。三年来，美国黑人斗争日渐走上以革命暴力对付反革命暴力的正确道路。它标志着美国黑人斗争进入了一个新的阶段。
    三年来的事实同样有力地证明，美帝国主义愈是要变本加厉地推行它的侵略政策和战争政策，特别是要扩大侵略越南的战争，就愈是要加紧对美国人民，特别是对美国黑人的进攻。美帝国主义扩大侵越战争，不仅给越南人民带来了深重的灾难，而且给美国人民，特别是美国黑人，带来了征兵、增税、通货膨胀和法西斯迫害。美帝国主义不仅是越南人民和世界人民最凶恶的敌人，也是美国人民最凶恶的敌人。
    在反对美帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策的斗争中，世界人民和美国人民是站在一起的，总是相互同情、相互支援的。越南人民在战场上狠狠地打击美帝国主义，是对美国黑人斗争的有力支援。同样，美国黑人反对美帝国主义种族歧视的斗争，也是对越南人民抗美救国斗争的重大支援。三年来，美国黑人兄弟坚决反对美帝国主义扩大侵越战争，拒绝服兵役，焚烧征兵证，把反对政治经济迫害的斗争，同反对美帝侵略越南的运动日益紧密地结合起来。他们做得好，做得对！我们深信，为了支援越南人民的抗美救国斗争，为了争取自己的自由和平等权利，具有光荣斗争传统的美国黑人兄弟，在美国人民和全世界人民的支持下一定会更加积极地行动起来，把抗暴斗争推向一个新的高峰。
    同志们，朋友们，在全世界人民反对美帝国主义的斗争中，苏联修正主义领导集团，从各个方面充当了美帝国主义的头号帮凶。他们从来不支持美国黑人兄弟反对美帝国主义的斗争。他们荒谬地把支持民族解放运动的正确立场，说成是什么“用种族观点来代替阶级斗争观点”，来为他们的叛卖活动打掩护。在越南问题上，他们不惜出卖越南人民的利益，竭力为美帝国主义效劳。他们配合美帝国主义，推行“以炸迫和”的阴谋，把莫斯科变成了帮助美帝国主义推销和谈阴谋的交易所。他们纵容美帝国主义对外的侵略政策，也就支持了美帝国主义对内的反动政策。他们不但充当美帝国主义扩大侵略战争的帮凶，同时也把自己放到帮助美帝国主义进攻美国人民、美国黑人可耻的地位。
    毛主席早就指出，美帝国主义是一只纸老虎。它在国内和国外都已经处于走投无路、狼狈不堪的境地。全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族都在反对美帝国主义。美帝国主义好象坐在一座火山上。目前美国黑人的抗暴斗争，使得美帝国主义胆颤心惊，坐立不安。美帝国主义的寿命不长了。
    在“四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激”的大好革命形势下，我们当前最主要的任务，就是组成一条最广泛、最真实的反对美帝国主义的国际统一战线。这条战线包括美国广大黑人群众和美国人民，包括全世界一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族，也包括一切受美帝国主义侵略、控制、干涉和欺负的国家和人民，但是绝不能包括美帝国主义的走狗和帮凶。苏联现代修正主义领导集团甘心为美帝效劳，千方百计地以所谓“统一行动”为幌子，妄图破坏这条真正的反美统一战线。最近在日本召开的第十二届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会上，苏联修正主义集团再一次进行破坏活动，把由它所控制的世界民主青年联盟的代表团塞进大会。为了抗议这一行动，十六个国家的代表宣布退出这届大会。其中一部分代表已经到达北京，参加了我们今天的大会，让我们对他们表示热烈的欢迎！中国人民完全支持他们这一坚持原则的正义立场。这也再一次说明，为了反对美帝国主义，必须反对以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义，世界革命人民的眼睛是越来越亮了，美帝国主义及其帮凶，不管玩弄什么阴谋诡计都是不会得逞的。
    同志们，朋友们，三年前毛主席在声明中说，“在全世界百分之九十以上的人民的支持下，美国黑人的正义斗争是一定要胜利的。万恶的殖民主义、帝国主义制度是随着奴役和贩卖黑人而兴盛起来的，它也必将随着黑色人种的彻底解放而告终。”毛主席的这个预言必将实现。
    中国人民是同美国人民友好的，中国人民是美国黑人的最可靠的朋友。在你们的斗争中，你们将永远得到中国人民的无限同情和积极支持。我们深信，美国黑人兄弟一定能够更加紧密地团结起来，联合一切被压迫的人民和被压迫的民族，结成最广泛的统一战线，同美帝国主义进行针锋相对的斗争。你们一定能够赢得胜利！你们一定能够获得解放！
    最后，让我们高呼：
    美帝国主义必败！
    美国黑人必胜！
    美国人民必胜！
    全世界人民必胜！
    毛主席万岁！
