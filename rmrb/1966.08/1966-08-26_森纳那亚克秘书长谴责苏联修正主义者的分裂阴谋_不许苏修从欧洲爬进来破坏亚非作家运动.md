Secretary-General Senanayake of the Permanent Bureau of Asian and African Writers condemned the conspiracy by Soviet revisionists to hold a splitist conference in Baku to sabotage the Asian and African writers' movement.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 24th, Senanayake, who is in Beijing, made these remarks to a reporter from Central People's Broadcasting Station on the 23rd. He severely denounced the plot by Soviet revisionists to hold a splitist conference in Baku, Azerbaijan, Soviet Union, to sabotage the Asian and African writers' movement.

Senanayake pointed out that the leadership of the Soviet Writers' Union has degenerated into accomplices of U.S. imperialism on the path of modern revisionism. He said that all writers and peoples engaged in anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles must wage a resolute struggle to eliminate the more dangerous threat of modern revisionism. I am glad to point out that the truly honest writers of the two continents of Asia and Africa have taken firm steps to eliminate the threat of those who attempt to crawl into our movement through the European door to change our basic line of struggle into a line of capitulation.

Senanayake said that the Soviet revisionists are planning to hold a splitist conference in Baku, Azerbaijan, Soviet Union. According to reports in Soviet newspapers, “the ‘Cairo Conference’ decided to hold a conference in Baku this August with the participation of Asian and African writers.” Another report refers to it as an “expanded meeting of the Soviet Committee for Liaison with Asian and African Writers”; another report calls it a “regular meeting of the Soviet Committee for Liaison with Asian and African Writers.” Yet another report refers to it as a “forum.” The Soviet splitists use ambiguous language, not only because they are weak and desperate, but also to try to cover up their sinister purposes and to lure some writers whom they think will be deceived by their words to accept invitations to go to Baku. In some Soviet reports, the invited foreign writers are sometimes referred to as “representatives” and sometimes as “guests.” Just like last year’s “March Splitist Conference” in Moscow, it is a conference with an improper name and an improper purpose.

He said that so far, the Soviet splitists have not dared to publicly state on what basis the Baku conference is being held, what its connection is with the “Cairo Conference,” and on what grounds it can be called an international conference.

He said that the Soviet revisionists claim, “The Baku conference will be a new and very important contribution to strengthening support for the heroic people of Vietnam.” These words typify their hypocrisy. When the Permanent Bureau of Asian and African Writers sought their agreement to hold an emergency conference of Asian and African writers to support the heroic people of Vietnam in their struggle against U.S. aggression, they came out in public to split the Asian and African writers' movement. They plotted the Cairo splitist conference to sabotage our emergency conference to support the people of Vietnam in their struggle against U.S. aggression. They do not demand the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops and their puppet troops from Vietnam and the dismantling of all U.S. bases in Vietnam. In fact, they do not support Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call of July 17, 1966.

Senanayake exposed that the main purpose of the Baku splitist conference is to affirm the Cairo splitist conference and conspire to sabotage the Third Asian and African Writers' Conference to be held in China.

He said that to assist the Permanent Bureau in implementing the decisions of the Permanent Bureau and the emergency conference of Asian and African writers, and to prepare for the Third Asian and African Writers' Conference to be held in China, an executive secretariat has been established in Beijing. The executive secretariat has begun preparations for the Third Asian and African Writers' Conference to be held in China.

Senanayake said that the Permanent Bureau calls on all Asian and African writers to be vigilant, strengthen unity, and actively participate in the struggles of the Asian and African peoples, using their pens as powerful weapons to expose the sabotage and splitist activities of U.S.-led imperialism and their agents and the number one accomplice, Soviet revisionism, until they are completely, thoroughly, and finally smashed.

    森纳那亚克秘书长谴责苏联修正主义者的分裂阴谋
    不许苏修从欧洲爬进来破坏亚非作家运动
    据新华社二十四日讯　在北京的亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克，八月二十三日向中央人民广播电台记者发表谈话，严厉谴责苏联修正主义者阴谋策划巴库分裂会议，破坏亚非作家运动。
    森纳那亚克指出，苏联作家协会的领导集团已经在现代修正主义的道路上堕落为美帝国主义的帮凶。他说，所有正在进行反帝反殖斗争的作家和人民必须展开坚决的斗争，消灭现代修正主义这种更危险的威胁。我很高兴地指出，亚非两大洲真正诚实的作家已经采取了坚定的步骤，消除企图从欧洲大门爬进我们运动来把基本的战斗路线改变为投降主义路线的威胁。
    森纳那亚克说，苏联修正主义者正想在苏联阿塞拜疆的巴库举行一个分裂会议。据苏联报纸报道，“在‘开罗会议’上，决定今年八月在巴库举行有亚非作家参加的会议”。另一个报道将它称为“苏联对亚非作家联络委员会的扩大会议”；另一报道又称之为“苏联亚非作家联络委员会的例会”。然而又一个报道称其为“论坛”。苏修分裂主义者词句含糊，不仅因为他们是虚弱的、绝望的，同时也为了要企图掩盖他们阴险的目的，收罗一些他们认为会受他们这些言词欺骗接受邀请去巴库的作家。在苏联的一些报道中，被邀的外国作家时而被称为“代表”，时而被称为“客人”。正如去年莫斯科的“三月分裂会议”一样，它是名不正而言不顺的。
    他说，至今，苏联分裂主义者还不敢公开提到巴库会议是根据什么召开的，它与“开罗会议”有何联系，凭什么能称它为国际会议。
    他说，苏联修正主义者说，“巴库会议将是对加强声援英雄越南人民的新的非常重要的贡献。”这些话典型地说明了他们的虚伪。在亚非作家常设局征求他们同意举行支持英雄的越南人民反对美国侵略的亚非作家紧急会议的时候，他们却跑出来公开地分裂亚非作家运动。他们策划了开罗分裂会议，破坏我们的支援越南人民反对美国侵略斗争的紧急会议。他们不要求立即撤出在越南的美军及其仆从军，拆除所有美国在越南的基地。实际上，他们是不支持胡志明主席一九六六年七月十七日的号召书。
    森纳那亚克揭露说，巴库分裂会议的主要目的是要肯定开罗分裂会议，阴谋破坏定在中国召开的第三届亚非作家大会。
    他说，为了协助亚非作家常设局执行常设局和亚非作家紧急会议的决定，为了筹备将在中国召开的第三届亚非作家大会，在北京已经设立执行书记处，执行书记处已经开始进行筹备将在中国召开的第三届亚非作家大会的工作。
    森纳那亚克说，常设局呼吁所有亚非作家，提高警惕，加强团结，积极地投入到亚非人民的斗争中去，以他们的笔为强大武器来揭露以美国为首的帝国主义，以及他们的代理人和头号帮凶苏联修正主义者的破坏和分裂活动，直到他们全部、彻底、最后被粉碎。
