	Chairman Mao Comes Towards Us

	On the 18th of August, I was so happy! It was a day I will never forget!

	At five in the morning, with a heart full of excitement, I stood in front of the stone bridge at Tiananmen, celebrating the great victory of the Cultural Revolution with hundreds of thousands of revolutionary masses. At that moment, the sun rose in the east, shining brightly over the land. Suddenly, I heard a thunderous cheer from the crowd below Tiananmen: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!" I looked up and saw a tall, sturdy figure in the uniform of the People's Liberation Army, walking in front of Vice Chairman Lin Biao and Premier Zhou Enlai. Who was this? Was it Chairman Mao? I rubbed my eyes and looked carefully; it was indeed Chairman Mao. I couldn't help but shout, "Chairman Mao is here! Long live Chairman Mao!" I was so excited that tears welled up in my eyes, and I was overwhelmed with emotion. At that moment, Chairman Mao walked across the stone bridge towards the vast sea of people, right in front of our air force unit, just a few steps away from us. Chairman Mao smiled and waved to us, walking among the crowd; then he returned to the stone bridge, took off his military cap and waved it repeatedly to the crowd, before putting it back on and striding with vigorous steps towards Tiananmen.

	At this moment, a thousand thoughts flooded my mind. For so many years, I had longed to see our great leader, Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! If we have today's happiness, it is all because of your correct leadership! I, a poor child from a family of generations of tenant farmers in the old society, was able to rise up and be liberated, and today I have become a pilot for the people. This is all thanks to your leadership in liberating the people and your cultivation and education.

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! When I saw you in military uniform, together with us, I thought of you leading countless Red Army soldiers in the struggle against the reactionaries and the old society in Jianxi and during the Long March. This is the greatest honor for us in the PLA, and a great encouragement. We will definitely always study your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions. We will definitely never be unworthy of the glorious title of PLA soldier, forever advancing!

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Seeing you so healthy, I am so happy, so blessed. You are the greatest revolutionary helmsman, the beacon of the world's revolutionary people. Your health is the greatest happiness for the Chinese people, the greatest happiness for the people of the world!

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You are so approachable, so kind and caring to us workers, peasants, and soldiers. You are always with us revolutionary masses, always with us heart to heart!

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! I will definitely respond to your great call, be a revolutionary pioneer, thoroughly defeat the old world, create a new world, temper and transform myself in the great waves of class struggle, and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, not resting until we achieve complete victory!

　　毛主席向我们走来
    八月十八日这一天，我太幸福了！是我终生难忘的一天！
    早晨五点钟，我怀着极其激动的心情，站在天安门的石桥前面，同百万革命群众一起庆祝无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。这时太阳在东方升起，光芒万丈，普照大地。突然听到天安门城楼下面的人群中，发出了雷鸣般的欢呼声：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！”我抬头一看，只见在林彪副主席和周恩来总理的前面，走着一位高大魁梧穿着人民解放军光荣军服的首长。这是谁？是毛主席吗？我擦了擦眼睛仔细看，正是毛主席。我禁不住高呼：“毛主席来了！毛主席万岁！”我兴奋得热泪盈眶，激动万分。这时毛主席走过石桥，向着浩浩荡荡的群众队伍走过来了，正好在我们空军部队的前面经过，离我们只几步远。毛主席微笑着向我们挥手，在群众面前走了一圈；回到石桥上，手拿军帽向大家一再挥手，然后戴上军帽，跨着健壮的步伐，向天安门城楼上走去。
    这时，千万种感想涌向我的心头。多少年啊多少年，我朝思暮想见到我们伟大的领袖毛主席。毛主席呀，毛主席！我们能有今天这样的幸福，那一桩那一件不是由于有了您老人家的正确领导！我这个在旧社会祖祖辈辈给地主当长工的穷人家的孩子，能够翻身得解放，今天成为人民的飞行员，就是您老人家领导人民解放和您培养教育的结果。
    毛主席呀，毛主席！当我看到您穿上了军装，同我们在一起，我就想起了您在井冈山，在长征中，领导无数工农红军向反动派向旧社会冲锋陷阵的情景。这是我们解放军的无上光荣，是对我们的巨大鼓舞。我们一定永远读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事，做您的好战士。我们一定永远无愧于解放军战士的光荣称号，永不变色，永远前进！
    毛主席呀，毛主席！看到您这样健康，我是多么高兴，多么幸福。您是最伟大的革命舵手，是世界人民革命的灯塔。您的健康，就是中国人民的最大幸福，世界人民的最大幸福！
    毛主席呀，毛主席！您是这样的平易近人，您对我们工农兵这样亲切，这样关心，您永远同我们革命群众在一起，永远同我们心连心！
    毛主席呀，毛主席！我一定响应您的伟大号召，当革命的闯将，彻底打倒旧世界，创造新世界，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中锻炼自己，改造自己，把无产阶级文化大革命坚决进行到底，不获全胜，决不收兵！
