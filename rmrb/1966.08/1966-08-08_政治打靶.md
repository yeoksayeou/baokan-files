Through "political target practice," the reactionary nature of the bourgeoisie's slogan of "liberty, equality, fraternity" was exposed, and a profound class education was received.

One whistle blast, and the comrades of the Third Company gathered to engage in "political target practice."

Weapon: The great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

Target: Anti-party, anti-socialist cliques.

Aim: The reactionary slogan of "liberty, equality, fraternity" proposed by bourgeois "authorities."

Everyone first studied Chairman Mao's words: "In this world, there is no such thing as love without reason, nor is there such a thing as hatred without reason." They concluded: Toward the enemy, we can only speak of dictatorship, not liberty; we can only speak of oppression, not equality. Then, they concentrated their fire on the so-called "fraternity."

The comrades' chests burned with rage, and every word was a bullet aimed at the anti-party cliques:

Love has always had a clear class nature, so how can there be "fraternity"?

Did Chiang Kai-shek have "fraternity" for our Communist Party comrades and revolutionary people? No! There was only "Better to kill a thousand innocents than let one guilty person escape!"

Did the Japanese fascists have "fraternity" for the Chinese people? No! There was only "Kill all, burn all, loot all"!

Did the American aggressors have "fraternity" for the Vietnamese people? No! There was only the beastly atrocities of burning, killing, and disemboweling!

Amidst the roars, the Five Good Soldier Hu Kongbin stood up and said:

"In the winter of 1948, the landlord's dogs forced my father to carry firewood more than ten miles away. My father was exhausted and starving, and he collapsed. The running dogs kicked and beat him, torturing him to death. Is this also called 'fraternity'?"

Why do the anti-party cliques insist on shouting "fraternity"? Through this "political target practice," the comrades exposed their conspiracy: They want us to forget class struggle, abandon proletarian dictatorship, and turn socialism into capitalism!

The entire company shouted in unison: Never!

The "target practice" ended. The entire company shouted: We must always remember class struggle, always remember proletarian dictatorship, always emphasize politics, and always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought!

    “政治打靶”
    通过“政治打靶”，揭穿了资产阶级的“自由、平等、博爱”这一口号的反动实质，受了一次深刻的阶级教育。
    解放军某部三连师东  行众文
    哨音一响，三连同志集合起来进行“政治打靶”。
    武器：伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    目标：反党反社会主义黑帮。
    瞄准点：资产阶级“权威”提出的“自由、平等、博爱”的反动口号。
    大家首先学习了毛主席说的：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨”这段话，得出结论：对敌人只能讲专政，不能讲自由，只能讲压迫，不能讲平等。然后集中火力向所谓“博爱”开火。
    同志们怒火燃烧着胸膛，每句话都是射向反党黑帮的子弹：
    爱，从来是有鲜明的阶级性的，怎么能“博爱”？
    蒋介石对我们共产党人、革命人民有“博爱”吗？没有。有的只是“宁可错杀三千，不能放过一个”！
    日本法西斯对中国人民有“博爱”吗？没有。有的只是“杀光、烧光、抢光”！
    美国强盗对越南人民有“博爱”吗？没有。有的只是烧杀放毒、剖腹挖心的兽行！
    在怒吼声里，五好战士胡孔宾呼地站了起来，他说：
    “一九四八年冬天，狗地主要我父亲到十多里的地方给他们挑木柴，父亲又累又饿，昏倒在地。狗腿子拳打脚踢，把我父亲给活活地折磨死了。难道这也叫‘博爱’！”
    反党黑帮为什么硬要叫嚷“博爱”呢？同志们通过这次“政治打靶”，把他们的阴谋戳穿了：他们是要我们忘记阶级斗争，丢掉无产阶级专政，把社会主义变成资本主义！
    全连同志一个声音：万万办不到！
    “打靶”结束了。全连高呼：我们要永远念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗！
