The enemy "Changjiang" has been sunk. The command center ordered our fleet to join the battle and pursue the fleeing enemy "Jianmen" at high speed. The warship roared through the waves, its hull swaying violently. The radio operator, Shi Suocai, was intently copying a telegram. He adjusted his falling headphones and tightened them, listening for the faint signals amidst the deafening roar of the engines. Any weak signal could not escape his keen ears. The cramped radio room, buried deep within the engine compartment, was like a steamer, with temperatures soaring to forty degrees. Shi Suocai sat in this heat, sweat pouring down his soaked clothes and dripping onto his seat. He dared not move his head, fearing that the sweat on his face would fall like raindrops onto the telegram paper. Shi Suocai quickly and neatly transcribed the command center's telegrams, then clearly relayed them to the bridge through the microphone for the fleet commander to hear.

Suddenly, there was a click in the headphones, and the signal disappeared. Shi Suocai quickly toggled the knobs on the receiver, but there was no sound. He took off the headphones to check, and they were not broken. He felt the wires, which were recently replaced, and they were fine. He thought, "Our ship is the command ship, and if communication with the command center is interrupted, the impact will be huge!" His heart raced with anxiety. "Should I report to the commander? No, I shouldn't disturb the commander's command. The more critical the situation, the more I need to stay calm and handle it. I must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, 'Overcome all difficulties, strive for victory.'" He thought, "Could it be that the high-speed movement of the warship has caused the receiver's parts to malfunction, resulting in poor contact?" He tried pushing the receiver to the right inside the casing with force, but there was still no sound. He then pulled it to the left with force, and the Morse code sounds appeared, indicating that the higher-ups were about to send an important message! As soon as he let go, the Morse code sounds disappeared. In this crucial moment, it was impossible to disassemble the machine for repairs. Shi Suocai decisively used his left hand to tightly hold the part to the left, and his right hand to copy the message. Thus, an important message about the enemy ship's escape direction and the fleet's pursuit course was transcribed onto the paper without missing a single word.

The fleet was getting closer to the enemy. The command center's messages were becoming more frequent and more important, with not a single moment's pause. Shi Suocai's right hand never stopped copying the messages, while his left hand held the receiver part tightly, like a screw, unmoved by the ship's violent swaying!

Time passed minute by minute, hour by hour. We engaged the enemy. Our fleet's cannons pounded the "Jianmen"! Shi Suocai's telegraph key clicked away, maintaining uninterrupted communication between the command center and the fleet.

Several deafening explosions, and the enemy "Jianmen" sank into the sea. The warship was too close to the enemy ship, and the massive waves caused by the sinking "Jianmen" made the warship lurch violently. This lurch threw the telegraph key Shi Suocai was using into the air, and it fell to the deck with a clatter. He quickly picked it up and placed it back on the worktable. At this moment, the commander handed down a message from the deck that the enemy ship had been sunk by us. Reading this message, Shi Suocai was so excited that tears streamed down his face. Quick, quickly spread the news of this victory, report to the command center, report to the Party Central Committee, report to Chairman Mao! He quickly translated the message into Morse code, ready to send it. But when he pressed the telegraph key, there was no sound. Looking at it, the output power indicator light was not on. He realized: the telegraph key was broken. The telegram must be sent out immediately. The training of practicing for war, facing difficulties, and making multiple preparations to deal with complex situations, now came into play. He turned around and pulled out a voltmeter from the back seat, quickly inserting the voltmeter's stylus into the telegraph key socket, and using his hand to hold another stylus to replace the telegraph key, skillfully tapping away.

"Dit-dah-dah, dah-dit-dit..." The news of the naval victory flew through the airwaves to the command center, to Beijing, to the entire country...

    把胜利的消息发出去
    荣立一等功的艇长　许永江  易俭如
    敌“章江号”已被击沉，指挥所命令我艇队加入战斗，高速追歼逃敌“剑门号”。战艇轰隆隆破浪飞驰，艇身大幅度摇摆，艇上的电讯手石锁才正在聚精会神地抄收电报。他又一次把滑落的耳机扶正戴紧，滴达的电报讯号声在震耳的机器怒吼声中忽隐忽现。但是，任何微弱的讯号，都躲不过他那敏锐的耳朵。只能坐不能站的小小报房，深深地埋在机舱里，室内温度高达四十度，石锁才象坐在蒸笼里一样，身上的汗水顺着湿透了的衣服直往坐垫上流。他甚至都不敢摇动一下脑袋，生怕脸上的汗珠会象雨点子似的洒到报文纸上。石锁才用惯常的工整的字迹，飞快地抄下指挥所的一份份报文，又用清晰的声音，通过话筒传到驾驶台上编队指挥员的耳里。
    忽然，耳机里“咔”地一响，讯号声消失了。石锁才迅速扳扳收讯机上这个旋钮，没有声音；扳扳那个旋钮，还是没有声音。他摘下耳机来检查，没坏；摸一摸导线，是不久前新换的，没问题。他想到我们艇是指挥艇，与指挥所电讯联络中断，这影响该有多大！心里一阵焦急。“要不要报告指挥员？不，不要去扰乱指挥员的指挥，越是关系重大，我越是要沉着应付，一定要象毛主席教导的那样，
  ‘排除万难，去争取胜利。’”他又想：会不会是战艇高速航行，收讯机内部有机件给震坏了，以致接触不良？他试着把收讯机朝机匣用力往右一推，耳机还是没有声音；又往左使劲一拉，滴滴达达的电码声出现了，是上级预告：下面有重要报文！当他把手一松，电码声又消失了。在这争分夺秒的时刻，拆开机器检修已经不可能，石锁才果断地用左手把机件往左紧紧扣住，右手抄报，就这样，一份通报敌舰逃窜方位、指示艇队追击航向的重要报文，一字不漏地在报文纸上出现了。
    艇队距离敌人愈来愈近，指挥所的来电也更紧密、更重要了，简直就没有一丝一毫的间歇。石锁才右手不停地抄报，左手就好似一只螺丝钉，紧紧地钉牢在收讯机上，任凭艇身怎样颠簸摇摆，都休想撼动他分毫！
    时间一分钟又一分钟、一小时又一小时的过去，我们和敌人打响了。我艇队的炮火猛扑“剑门号”！石锁才手里电键滴达，始终保持指挥所与艇队的电讯畅通无阻。
    几声震天动地的巨响，敌“剑门号”沉入了海底。战艇与敌舰靠得太近了，“剑门号”这个庞然大物下沉时掀起的一排大浪，使战艇剧烈一晃。这一晃，把电讯手用来发报的电键抛了起来，“咣啷”一声又摔到地席上，石锁才连忙拣起放回工作台。就在这时，指挥员从舱面递来了一份敌舰被我击沉的报文。读着这份报文，石锁才激动兴奋得扑簌簌掉下了热泪。快，快把这胜利的消息发出去，报告指挥所，报告党中央，报告毛主席！他迅速译好电码，准备发报。可是，一按电键，没有声音，一看，输出电源的指示灯不亮，他意识到：电键摔坏了。电报一定要马上发出去，平时练为战，从难从严、作多种准备以应付复杂情况的训练，这时发挥了作用。他一个转身从后座抽出测电表，迅速把测电表上的一支电笔插入电键插座，用手拿着另一支电笔代替电键，熟练地敲击起来。
      “滴达达，达滴滴……”海战胜利的喜讯，通过电波，飞向指挥所，飞向北京，飞向全国……
