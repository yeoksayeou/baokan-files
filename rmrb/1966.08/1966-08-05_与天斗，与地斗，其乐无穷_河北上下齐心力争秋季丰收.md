According to Xinhua News Agency, Beidaihe: Most of Hebei Province's autumn crops are growing better than last year. Party committees at all levels are seizing the revolution to promote production, leading the masses to redouble their efforts and strive for an autumn harvest.

The Communist Party of Hebei Province recently issued a notice, requiring local party organizations to seriously study Chairman Mao's works while leading rural summer production. The goal is to achieve victory in both revolution and production. The Provincial Party Committee emphasized that it is necessary to arm cadres and peasants with Mao Zedong Thought, establish the idea of farming for the revolution, oppose arrogance and complacency, and overcome various natural disasters. The aim is to strive for high standards in all work.

Local areas are actively taking measures to implement the Provincial Party Committee's instructions. In the Zhangjiakou Prefecture's plateau region, the Shangyi County Committee organized cadres and community members to study Chairman Mao's relevant works. They also held a meeting of commune party committee secretaries for ideological mobilization. A large number of county and commune cadres were sent to lagging teams to mobilize the masses. They overcame the difficulties caused by the large area of sorghum planting and the high labor demand for weeding, doubling the weeding progress. In Wuyi County, Hengshui Prefecture, there were over 44,000 mu of spring-sown crops with sparse seedlings. After studying Chairman Mao's relevant works, the revolutionary spirit was greatly promoted. The entire county mobilized over 30,000 laborers, who, through replanting and transplanting, ensured that all plots were fully seeded.

Currently, spring-sown crops in Hebei Province have generally been weeded two to three times, basically eliminating weeds. Summer-sown crops have also been weeded once. One-quarter of the spring-sown crop fields have been fertilized for the first time. Local areas have also timely prevented and treated pests in grain and cotton fields, ensuring the normal growth of crops.

    与天斗，与地斗，其乐无穷
    河北上下齐心力争秋季丰收
    据新华社保定电　河北省大部地区秋熟作物长势比去年好。各级党委正在抓革命促生产，领导群众再接再厉，夺取秋季丰收。
    中共河北省委最近发出通知，要求各地党组织在领导农村夏季生产时，一定要认真学习毛主席著作，抓革命、促生产，争取革命和生产双胜利。省委强调指出，必须用毛泽东思想武装干部和农民，树立为革命种田的思想，反对骄傲自满和畏难情绪，积极战胜各种自然灾害，力争各项工作达到高标准。
    各地积极采取措施，贯彻省委指示。在张家口专区坝上地区，尚义县委组织干部社员学习了毛主席的有关著作，又召开公社党委书记会议进行思想动员，派出大批县社干部深入到后进队蹲点发动群众，克服了由于谷子种植面积大、锄谷用工多而产生的畏难情绪，使锄谷子的进度加快了一倍。衡水专区的武邑县有四万四千多亩春播作物缺苗，社员和干部学习了毛主席的有关著作，革命精神大发扬，全县出动了三万多个劳动力，经过补种和移苗补栽，使所有的地块基本上实现了全苗。
    目前，河北全省的春播作物，一般已锄过两三遍以上，基本上消灭了草荒，夏播作物也锄完了头遍。春播作物田已有四分之一追上了头遍肥。各地还及时防治了粮田棉田的虫害，保证庄稼正常生长。
