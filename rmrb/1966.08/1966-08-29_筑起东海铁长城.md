The dawn rises in the east,
The conch shells sound in unison,
The red flag flutters in the wind,
We come to train our troops!

We enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's great call,
Marching towards the revolutionary direction of being both workers and peasants, both cultural and martial!

Our hearts are with Beijing,
Facing the vast waves of the sea.
The people of Chongwu on the East China Sea front,
Build an iron Great Wall.

Across the sea,
The waves of the Taiwan Strait roll,
The blood debt of our forefathers must be settled.
Looking into the distance,
The winds of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are urgent,
There is cannon fire on the banks of the Yangtze.

Two-thirds of the world's people are not yet liberated,
The burden of revolution is truly heavy.

Facing the changing winds of the five continents and four seas,
We must remember Chairman Mao's words:
To deal with the vicious American imperialism,
We must wage a people's war.

All the people are soldiers,
A people's war!
It is the magic weapon against invaders,
It is the path to human liberation.
Relying on it,
We obtained our liberation;
Relying on it,
We are invincible in battle.
We defeated the Japanese fascist bandits,
We annihilated the 800,000 Kuomintang bandits.
The dying American imperialism,
Will also perish in the ocean of people's war.

All the people are soldiers,
A people's war!
Glory tradition,
Passed down through generations.
We will forever hold our guns,
We are the militia of the East China Sea front.
We are brave and tenacious,
We fear no sacrifice;
We remember Chairman Mao's words,
We train our troops every day.
The people of Chongwu,
Train our troops,
The policy of combining labor and martial arts is good.
The wind is fierce, the water is cold, but our hearts are hot,
Under the sun and rain, our resolve is firm.
The East China Sea is vast,
I will measure it,
The cliffs are treacherous,
I dare to climb them.
Under the starlight and waves, I can see clearly,
I will trample the thousand-layered evil waves.
Always hold our guns,
In great winds and waves, we forge true skills.
Bayonets dare to face the red,
Raise the gun to extinguish the fireflies,
Throw grenades far and accurately,
Tactics are swift and precise.
Wherever the enemy comes from,
We will definitely annihilate them there!

    筑起东海铁长城（多口词）
    福建惠安县崇武镇渔民民兵业余演出队集体创作
    曙光东方升，
    海螺响连声，
    红旗迎风飘，
    我们来练兵！
    热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召，
    向亦工亦农亦文亦武的革命化方向前进！
    心向首都北京城，
    面对波涛千万顷。
    东海前线崇武人，
    筑起一道铁长城。
    海那边，
    台湾海峡浊浪滚，
    父兄的血债要算清。
    望远方，
    亚非拉美风云急，
    贤良江畔有炮声。
    世界上三分之二的人民没解放，
    革命的担子真不轻。
    对着五洲四海风云变幻，
    毛主席的话牢记在心：
    对付凶恶的美帝国主义，
    必须实行人民战争。
    全民皆兵，
   人民战争！
   是对付侵略者的法宝，
   是人类解放的途径。
   靠着它，
   我们得到了解放；
   靠着它，
   我们战无不胜。
   打败日本法西斯强盗，
   消灭了八百万蒋匪兵。
   垂死的美帝国主义，
   也将在人民战争的海洋里没顶。
   全民皆兵，
   人民战争！
   光荣传统，
   世代继承。
   我们永远紧握手中枪，
   我们是东海前线的民兵。
   我们勇敢顽强，
   不怕牺牲；
   我们牢记毛主席的话，
   天天勤练兵。
   崇武人，
   勤练兵，
   劳武结合好方针。
   风狂水冷心里热，
   日晒雨淋志坚定。
   东海宽，
   我要量，
   悬崖险，
   我敢登。
   星光浪影认得清，
   恶浪千层要踩平。
   时刻紧握手中枪，
   大风大浪里练出真本领。
   刺刀敢见红，
   举枪灭流萤，
   投弹远又准，
   战术快又精。
   敌人从那里来，
   我们一定在那里把他消灭干净！
