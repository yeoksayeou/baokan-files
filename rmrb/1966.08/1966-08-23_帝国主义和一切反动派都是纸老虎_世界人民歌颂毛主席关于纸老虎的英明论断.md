Imperialism and All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers

The World's People Praise Chairman Mao's Brilliant Judgment on Paper Tigers

A certain department's inspector of the Albanian People's Army, Hasan Musabelli, said: Comrade Mao Zedong's judgment on paper tigers is a great encouragement and education for the people of the world who are opposing imperialism and modern revisionism. Life has proven the correctness of this judgment. The victory of the Chinese revolution has proven this, and the victory of the Albanian national liberation war has proven this. Albania is a small nation, and during the period of the national liberation war, we encountered the German and Italian fascists who were armed to the teeth. At that time, the enemy had airplanes, tanks, and cannons, and seemed very frightening; however, under the leadership of our party, our people finally defeated the enemy. For example, in Vietnam, the U.S. imperialists threw all their killing weapons, except the atomic bomb, into the war of aggression against Vietnam, but still suffered defeat.

The chairman of the Kagoshima branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association, Seiichi Hirasawa, said: Chairman Mao Zedong's famous judgment that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers was specifically proven in the Korean War. It revealed the essence of U.S. imperialism, and the process of the Korean War completely realized Mao Zedong's prophecy. If the U.S. imperialists dare to provoke an aggressive war against China, they will prove this point on an even larger scale.

The chairman of the Syrian General Federation of Trade Unions, Khaled Jundi, said: Chairman Mao's judgment on paper tigers greatly encouraged the world's people in their anti-imperialist struggle after the Second World War. Twenty years ago, when the Chinese people were engaged in arduous struggles, Chairman Mao wisely announced this judgment. Chairman Mao's judgment is very correct, and the practice of the Chinese revolution has proven this. The anti-American struggle of the Vietnamese people, the struggles of the Congolese (Leopoldville), Algerians, and all the peoples of Asia and Africa have also proven the correctness of this judgment. Chairman Mao is the greatest and most far-sighted statesman.

The deputy director of the Sana'a Radio Station in Yemen, Muhammad Khurani, said: Chairman Mao pointed out that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. Chairman Mao's words are truth, and are easily understood by the masses. In the more than twenty years since Chairman Mao's speech was delivered, the sphere of influence of imperialism has become smaller and smaller, and the revolutionary forces of the people have become more and more powerful, which shows that imperialism is heading towards extinction, and the revolutionary forces are advancing step by step.

The first general secretary of the National Youth Organization of Lumumbists in the Congo (Leopoldville), Lumbuele-Buta, said: Chairman Mao said: Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers, which is correct, we agree with his opinion, because at the beginning of the struggle in the Congo, the puppet army of Mobutu, equipped with modern war materials, seemed very powerful, but when the patriots truly rose up to fight against it, we saw that this puppet army became weaker and weaker. The victories of the revolutions in China, Cuba, Algeria... have proven this, and the revolution in the Congo (Leopoldville) will certainly prove this.

An old worker from Algeria, Rabi, said: U.S. imperialism has airplanes, tanks, and warships, and looks frightening, but the Vietnamese people are the ones who keep winning, and U.S. imperialism is the one who keeps suffering defeats. All this shows that once the people take up arms and mobilize, they are the most powerful, and imperialism and all reactionaries are equal to zero. The Vietnamese people will certainly, like the Algerians, achieve the final victory, and the defeated will be U.S. imperialism.

The political secretary of the Argentine Communist Vanguard Organization, Elias Seman, said: When the Chinese comrades said that the atomic bomb is a paper tiger and U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger, they insisted on the Leninist position that the proletariat and the oppressed peoples can and must defeat imperialism.

	* * *

The Colombian journalist, Rigoberto Zambrano, said: Twenty years ago, in 1946, when the United States was hoping to see the effects of the crimes it had committed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki a year earlier, that is, to arouse terror in the people and undermine their fighting spirit, Mao Zedong published a brilliant article in which he pointed out that imperialism and all reactionaries are merely paper tigers, and the atomic bomb used by the U.S. reactionaries to threaten people is also merely a paper tiger.

	Mao Zedong's brilliant article freed the Chinese people from the nuclear threat of the U.S. counter-revolutionary purpose, guided the revolution to victory, and ensured the development of the construction of New China, ensuring progress in all fields, including nuclear development.

	* * *

The Mexican economist, Eleazar Morales Aragon, said: The anti-imperialist storm of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America is in the process of surging. Chairman Mao Zedong's statement that "imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers" has even greater and immeasurable significance for the national liberation struggles being waged by the peoples of the various countries of Latin America. Chairman Mao's statement will certainly greatly promote the progress of the anti-U.S. imperialist struggles of the peoples of Latin America, and the situation will become more and more favorable for the peoples of the various countries.

	* * *

The Chilean scientist, Danilo Villarroel, said: I have the highest faith in Chairman Mao, because Chairman Mao has developed Marxism-Leninism in politics, military affairs, and other fields, and made outstanding contributions to the world people's revolution. Chairman Mao's point that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers is the most correct strategic and tactical viewpoint. The revolutionary peoples of the whole world need a genius like Chairman Mao who creates Marxism.

	* * *

The secretary of the secretariat of the French Communist Movement (Marxist-Leninist), Jacques Jurgens, said: The Vietnamese people will be victorious because they are waging a people's revolutionary war, because, after all, as Comrade Mao Zedong taught, and as the Vietnamese comrades led by the respected Comrade Ho Chi Minh have already victoriously proven, the decisive factor is man, and man will ultimately defeat the seemingly powerful material forces. It is in this sense that we must understand Mao Zedong's famous statement: "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers."

### 帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎  世界人民歌颂毛主席关于纸老虎的英明论断

    帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎
    世界人民歌颂毛主席关于纸老虎的英明论断
    阿尔巴尼亚人民军某部巡视员哈桑·穆萨贝利说：毛泽东同志关于纸老虎的论断对于世界正在反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义的人民是一个极大的鼓舞和教育。生活证明了这一论断的正确性。中国革命的胜利证明了这一点，阿尔巴尼亚民族解放战争的胜利证明了这一点。阿尔巴尼亚是个小小的民族，在民族解放战争时期，我们遇到了武装到牙齿的德国和意大利法西斯。那时，敌人有飞机、坦克和大炮，看来是非常吓人的；但是，我国人民在党的领导下，终于战胜了敌人。又比如在越南，美帝把除原子弹外自己的全部杀伤性武器投入侵越战争，但还是遭到了失败。
                            ＊＊
    日本日中友好协会鹿儿岛支部长平濑实武说：毛泽东主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的著名论断，在朝鲜战争中具体地得到了证实。它揭示了美帝国主义的本质，朝鲜战争的进程，完全实现了毛泽东的预言。如果美帝国主义胆敢对中国挑起一场侵略战争，将在更大的规模上证实这个论点的正确。
                          ＊＊
    叙利亚工会总联合会主席哈利德·琼迪说：毛主席关于纸老虎的论断大大鼓舞了世界人民在第二次世界大战后的反帝斗争。二十年前，在中国人民进行艰苦斗争的时候，毛主席就英明地宣布了这一论断。毛主席的论断非常正确，中国革命的实践证明了这一点。越南人民的反美斗争、刚果（利）、阿尔及利亚和所有亚非人民的斗争也证明了这一论断的正确。毛主席是最伟大和最有远见的政治家。
                          ＊＊
    也门萨那电台副台长穆罕默德·霍拉尼说：毛主席指出帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。毛主席的话都是真理，都是群众所容易领会的话。在毛主席的谈话发表以后的二十多年以来，帝国主义势力范围越来越小，人民革命力量越来越发展壮大，这说明帝国主义正在走向灭亡，革命力量不断向前发展。
                          ＊＊
    刚果（利）卢蒙巴主义全国青年组织第一总书记伦布埃勒—布塔说：毛主席说：帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎，说得对，我们同意他的意见，因为在刚果斗争刚开始的时候，用现代化战争物资装备起来的蒙博托傀儡军队似乎很强大，但是在爱国者真正起来和它斗争的时候，我们看到这支傀儡军越来越没有力量。中国、古巴、阿尔及利亚……革命的胜利证明了这一点，刚果（利）的革命也一定会证实这一点。
                            ＊＊
    阿尔及利亚老工人拉比说：美帝国主义有飞机、坦克、军舰，看起来可怕，但是不断取得胜利的是越南人民，不断遭到失败的是美帝国主义。这一切说明，人民一旦拿起了武器，动员起来，就最有力量，帝国主义和一切反动派都等于零。越南人民肯定会象阿尔及利亚一样，取得最后胜利，而失败的是美帝国主义。
                          ＊＊
    阿根廷共产主义先锋组织政治书记埃利亚斯·塞曼说：当中国同志说原子弹是纸老虎、美帝国主义是纸老虎时，他们坚持了确定无产阶级和被压迫人民可能和必须战胜帝国主义的列宁主义的立场。
                          ＊＊
    哥伦比亚记者里尔加特·山比尔说：二十年前的一九四六年八月，美国正在期望看到一年前它在广岛、长崎进行的犯罪效果，即在人民中煽起恐怖心理，并挫伤他们的战斗性的时候，毛泽东发表了天才的论文，他在文章中指出，帝国主义和一切反动派只不过是纸老虎，美国反动派用来威胁人们的原子弹也不过是纸老虎。
    毛泽东的这一光辉文章，使中国人民从美国的反革命目的的核威胁下获得永远的解放，引导革命获得胜利，并且保证了新中国建设的发展，保证了在包括核开发的一切部门取得了进步。
                            ＊＊
    墨西哥经济学家埃列塞尔·莫拉莱斯·阿拉贡说：亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民的反帝风暴正处在风起云涌的进程中。毛泽东主席关于“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的论述对拉丁美洲各国人民正在进行的民族解放斗争更加具有现实的和不可估量的意义。毛主席的这一论述肯定会大大地推动拉丁美洲反对美帝国主义斗争的进展，局势对各国人民越来越有利。
                          ＊＊
    智利科学家达尼洛·比利亚罗埃尔说：我对毛主席有着最高的信仰，这是因为毛主席无论在政治或军事等方面都发展了马克思列宁主义，对世界人民革命作了杰出的贡献。毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的论点，是最正确的战略和策略观点。全世界革命人民需要毛主席这样一个天才的创造性的马克思主义者。
                      ＊＊
    法国共产主义运动（马列主义）书记处书记雅克·儒尔盖说：越南人民必胜，因为他们在进行一场人民革命战争，因为归根结蒂，正如毛泽东同志所教导的那样，正如在以尊敬的胡志明同志为首的越南同志已经胜利地证实的那样，决定性的因素是人，人终将战胜表面上强大的物质力量。正是在这个意义上，我们必须理解毛泽东这一著名论断：“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”。
