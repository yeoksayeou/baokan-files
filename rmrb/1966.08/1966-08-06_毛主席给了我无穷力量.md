On August 6, 1965, our People's Liberation Army Navy forces achieved a great victory in the seas off the southeast coast. They raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized politics, and exhibited a high degree of courage and tenacity in battle. They dared to and were skilled at fighting close-quarters and night battles at sea, decisively, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilating the "Jianmen" and "Zhangjiang" warships of the Chiang bandits that had intruded. In this brilliant naval battle, many heroic and model figures emerged, including the proletarian hard-bone warrior Mai Xiande. Published here are a few battle stories written by the heroes who participated in this naval battle. — Editors

Chairman Mao Gave Me Infinite Strength
Wu Zhenye, a first-class meritorious engine operator

The control lever was pushed to the bottom, and the rapidly rotating main engine sped up even more. The boat surged forward with a roar, charging towards the enemy.

Deputy Captain Huang Maosu ducked into the engine room and handed me a small note. It read: "The battle is about to begin. You must ensure the machinery operates normally and accomplish feats for the people!" I instantly felt my blood boil, quickly took a pencil and a piece of paper from the squad leader, and crouched in the swaying engine room to write a pledge: "I will complete the mission." My handwriting was crooked, but it was my battle oath! I silently commanded myself: Even if the sky falls, I must ensure the boat can move and charge forward!

I was about to hand over the pledge to the command deck when suddenly a flash of fire lit up the cabin, and the boat shook violently. The pungent smell of gunpowder filled the air. The engine room was hit! The thought flashed through my mind. There was no time to send the pledge now, dear Party, please test me in battle.

There was no time to report. I lunged towards the smoking and flaming spot, quickly rushing to save the main engine. I dashed to the machine, swiftly opened the emergency backup switch, used seawater to cool the main engine, and removed the danger of the main engine exploding. Immediately, I dealt with the ruptured freshwater pipe. The situation was urgent. I covered one hand over the crack, while the other hand searched for rubber and wire. The boiling water scalded me, but I didn't care! I clenched my teeth and squeezed the crack tighter. The squad leader noticed the urgent situation here, rushed over to help me, but I quickly gestured for him to continue monitoring the other machines and maintain speed. I grabbed the rubber and wire, quickly wrapping it around the crack. The freshwater stopped leaking. Without a moment to spare, I turned and jumped to the breach to plug the leak. Looking at the hole, I suddenly noticed a bright trail outside the breach, emitting a faint white and green light, cutting through the sky, and raising water columns beside the boat. The white and green light was the enemy's cannon fire, why were they aiming at us? It must be that the breach light exposed our position. Thinking this, I quickly signaled the squad leader to navigate without lights. The cabin instantly went pitch black.

In the darkness, I groped for the plugging materials, and my hand touched a soft package: a bag of cotton cloth. Good, I'll use it to plug the hole.

The boat leaped over the waves, and the angry waves crashed against the hull. The water pressure concentrated at the breach, and I felt my arms go numb and my legs go weak, gradually unable to hold on. Just then, a huge wave crashed in, and the boat lurched violently, throwing me high into the air. My hand relaxed, and the not yet fully plugged cotton bag was washed away, and seawater rushed into the cabin again.

I struggled in the dark cabin, searching for the cotton bag, feeling left and right, finally discovering the cotton bag wedged between the pipes. The cotton was soaked with water, and when I lifted it, it was so heavy! Plus, after a long time of sailing and shaking, my strength was depleted, my lower limbs were weak, and my arms were cramping. I wanted to call the squad leader to help, but now we were engaging the enemy, and the main engine couldn't be left unattended. I gritted my teeth and continued alone!

In this pitch-black engine room, listening to the high-pitched sound of the machinery, I silently recited the words of Chairman Mao written on the small blackboard in the engine room before we set sail:

"Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory."

Instantly, the great figure of Chairman Mao seemed to stand before me, his smiling eyes looking at me affectionately, as if watching whether I could do as he taught.

I felt a surge of heat throughout my body, and suddenly felt my strength doubled. I swung my arm, fiercely hugged the heavy cotton bag, and pressed it onto the breach along with my body. I then propped it up with a wooden support. This time, the seawater wouldn't be able to get in. I couldn't help but say to myself:

"Chairman Mao, it is you who gave me infinite strength!"

The squad leader quickly used the main engine to remove the water from the bottom of the cabin, and the other damages were also promptly repaired.

The fleet maintained a strict formation and charged straight at the enemy before opening fire. Our boat did not fall behind due to the damage in the engine room.

    一九六五年的今天——八月六日，我人民解放军海军部队，在东南沿海海面打了一个大胜仗。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，高度发扬英勇顽强的战斗精神，敢于和善于在海上打近战、夜战，坚决、彻底、干净、全部歼灭了前来窜犯的蒋匪“剑门号”和“章江号”军舰。在这场漂亮的海上歼灭战中，涌现了无产阶级硬骨头战士麦贤得以及许多英雄模范人物。这里发表的，是参加这次海战的英雄们写的几个战斗故事。——编者
    毛主席给了我无穷力量
    荣立一等功的轮机兵　伍振业
    操纵杆猛压到底，飞速转动的主机又加快了速度，战艇猛往前一冲，“呼”地一声向敌人扑去。
    副艇长黄茂素弯腰钻进机舱里，把一张小纸条递到我面前，纸条上写着：“战斗就要打响，你们一定要保证机器正常运转，为人民立功！”
    我顿时周身热血沸腾，连忙向班长要来一枝铅笔、一张记录纸，蹲在颠簸的机舱里写决心书：“保证完成任务。”字迹歪歪斜斜，但却是我的战斗誓言！我暗暗命令自己：哪怕天塌下来，也要保证战艇开得动，冲得上！
    我拿着决心书准备送往指挥台，舱内突然火光一闪，战艇剧烈一震，呛鼻的硝烟到处弥漫。机舱中弹！一个念头从脑子里闪过。决心书来不及送啦，亲爱的党，请在战斗中考验我吧。
    请示已来不及，我飞身扑到嗤烟冒火处，赶紧先抢救主机。我一步窜到机器跟前，迅速打开紧急备用开关，引用海水冷却主机，解除主机爆炸的危险。紧接着，赶忙处理破裂的淡水管。情况紧急，我一只手捂住裂口，另一只手找橡皮、铁丝。沸滚的水烫得我直咧嘴，不管它！我咬紧牙关把裂口捏得更紧。班长发现这里情况紧急，冲过来想帮助我，我连忙向他摆手，要他继续照看其他几部机器，保证航速。我把橡皮、铁丝都摸到手后，飞快地把它缠到裂口上，淡水不再往外溢了。随后，顾不得透口气，又转身跳到破口处堵漏。就着洞口，我忽然瞥见破口外边一条光闪闪的弹道，发着惨淡的白光绿光，划破长空，在艇旁激起一根根水柱。白光绿光是敌舰的炮弹，怎么专对准我们打？一定是破口漏光暴露艇队位置。想到这里，我迅速用手势报告班长灭灯航行。舱内顿时一片漆黑。
    在黑暗中，我摸索着找堵漏器材，一手触着个软包：一袋棉纱。好，就用它堵。
    艇身在浪尖腾跳，怒涛冲击艇舷，海水压力聚集在破口这一点，我觉得手臂发麻腿发酸，渐渐支持不住了。这时，突然一个大浪扑来，艇身猛一颠簸，把我抛起老高，我手一松劲，还没堵严实的棉纱袋被冲开，海水又涌进舱里。
    我费劲地在漆黑的舱内摸索棉纱袋，左摸右摸，终于发现棉纱袋夹在管路中间。棉纱浸了水，一提，好沉！加上长时间航行颠簸，体力消耗过多，下肢发软，双臂抽筋。我想招呼班长一齐来堵，可现在正在接敌，主机离不开人，我一咬牙，一个人继续再干！
    在这黑得伸手不见五指的机舱里，听着机器高亢的声音，我默诵着出航前我们写在机舱小黑板上的那段毛主席语录：
    “下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    顿时，毛主席他老人家的伟大身影就象站在我面前，含笑的眼睛亲切地望着我，好象在看我能不能象他老人家教导的那样去做。
    我浑身一热，立刻感到力量倍增。我一抡胳膊，猛地抱起沉重的棉纱袋，和着身体一齐压到破口上，并趁势顶上木支柱。这一回海水休想钻进来了。我禁不住对自己说：
    “毛主席啊，是您给了我无穷的力量！”
    班长迅速用主机排除舱底积水，其他破损也都及时修复了。
    艇队保持着严整的队形，直冲到敌人跟前才开火。我们艇没有因为机舱的破损而拉下一步。
