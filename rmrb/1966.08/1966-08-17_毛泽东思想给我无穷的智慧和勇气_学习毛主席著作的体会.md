The bravery of proletarian revolutionary warriors comes from the great Mao Zedong Thought. Our people's pilots are infinitely loyal to the Party and the people, and have a high sense of responsibility for the world proletarian revolutionary cause. Bravery most highly reflects hatred for the enemy and love for the people. Only by being selfless can one be fearless. With a brave spirit, one will have unwavering confidence, fight with skill, and fight with wisdom; in air combat, one can seize the initiative, maintain the initiative, or turn a passive situation into an active one. Our magic weapon for defeating the enemy is close combat, daring to engage in "airborne bayonet fighting"; bravery is our absolute advantage, and with this spiritual atomic bomb, we can defeat all enemies.

Comrade Lin Biao said: "The greatest combat effectiveness is in people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, who are brave and fearless of death." In the past, I lacked understanding of this truth. I thought that an airplane is a highly precise modern weapon, and without skill, one can't even take off, let alone fight a battle! In air combat, the primary factor is skill. However, in air combat, one often encounters such problems: when facing an enemy with superior skill, do you dare to fight? When facing an enemy aircraft with superior performance, do you dare to fight? When facing more enemy aircraft, do you dare to engage? Do you dare to get close and fight? When the enemy aircraft uses cunning tactics to try to escape, do you dare to pursue and attack relentlessly? When in a passive situation, do you dare to counterattack boldly?... To answer these questions, one cannot do without two words: bravery. If one is not brave, even if you have the best aircraft and the highest skills, it is all in vain!

Bravery brings forth skill and wisdom

Some people say: "The more skilled, the braver." I think this is incorrect. This reflects a lack of emphasis on politics and is a purely military viewpoint. Because it overly emphasizes the role of "skill," neglecting the factor of ideology; it places "skill" in the first position and ideology in a secondary position.

The level of "skill" is one thing, but whether one can fully utilize "skill" in air combat is another. This depends on whose hands the "skill" is in and the person's mental state, whether they have a brave spirit. We are the people's pilots, infinitely loyal to the Party and the people, with a high sense of responsibility for the world proletarian revolutionary cause. We master "skill," and it is like adding wings to a tiger. Even if our "skill" is not yet high, we will fully utilize our technology, relying on the greatest bravery, to annihilate the enemy. Our squadron was established not long ago, and some comrades participated in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. At that time, they had only flown for 20-30 hours on fighter jets, and their skills were not yet proficient. Their opponents, the American air pirates, had mostly participated in World War II and had flown for 1,000-2,000 hours. In terms of "skill," the American air pirates could be considered "highly skilled," but they lacked courage. In comparison, our "skill" was not high, but because of our intense hatred for the American air pirates' savage bombing of Korea and our northeastern region, we would get angry at the sight of American air pirates, grab them and fight, and as soon as we engaged, we would shoot down three enemy aircraft. The "highly skilled" American air pirates, however, were cowardly, unable to fully utilize their skills, and became our defeated enemies!

With a brave spirit, we fight with confidence, clear minds, skill, and wisdom. To shoot down enemy aircraft, we can perform technical and tactical maneuvers that we have never done before. For example, in our squadron, Zhang Yilin, in one air combat, pursued an enemy aircraft from an altitude of 10,000 meters to 200-300 meters low altitude, towards the sea. At that time, Zhang Yilin had never flown at low altitude or over the sea. However, he bravely pursued the enemy to low altitude and over the sea, flying techniques that he had not mastered before. In the pursuit, the speed exceeded the theoretical maximum performance of the aircraft, and the aircraft body tilted severely. Zhang Yilin cleverly stabilized the aircraft. With an unyielding heroic spirit, he pursued and attacked relentlessly, finally shooting down the enemy aircraft into the sea. These skills and wisdom were not achieved by anything other than the proletarian brave spirit!

Of course, we do not deny the role of skill. We proletarian warriors, with a high class consciousness and a fearless, brave spirit, combined with solid skills, are like adding wings to a tiger, exerting tremendous power on the battlefield. "Skill" is a factor in combat effectiveness, but it is not the decisive factor. "Skill" is subject to ideological control. "Skill" is not the foundation of bravery; the foundation of bravery is the proletarian consciousness, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

Bravery can turn a passive situation into an active one

Chairman Mao said: "Freedom of action is the lifeblood of an army. Without this freedom, the army is close to being defeated or annihilated." Air combat is a struggle between the enemy and us to seize the initiative and avoid being passive.

Seizing the initiative, maintaining the initiative, or turning a passive situation into an active one, all require a brave spirit. However, this bravery is not recklessness. At the beginning of my air combat training, when I was in a dominant position attacking others, I was very impulsive. Regardless of whether the opponent was above or below, or how complex their movements were, I would attack as soon as I engaged, thinking that this was bravery and could maintain the initiative. In fact, this often had the opposite effect. I had such a lesson: once, I and Feng Jiaozheng practiced air combat. At the beginning, I had a dominant position over him. However, I did not find the breakthrough point, attacked blindly, and did not pay attention to observing and judging the opponent's movements. Feng Jiaozheng suddenly made a sharp upward movement to my side, immediately reduced speed, and left me behind. Then he came at me, catching me off guard, turning the initiative into passivity, and attack into being attacked.

After this, in air combat, I paid attention to choosing the breakthrough point and observing the opponent's movements. However, air combat is not like bayonet fighting. In bayonet fighting, two people face each other, and you can judge the opponent's mental state and movements from their facial expressions and gestures. In air combat, one is in front and the other behind, and you cannot see the opponent's facial expressions, but can only analyze the enemy's mental state and intentions through the enemy aircraft's movements. For example: some enemy aircraft, after being targeted by us, pull and tug hard, seeming very fierce, but in fact, they are cowardly, fearing being attacked. Some hesitate, but do not counterattack when they do counterattack, indicating they lack the courage and confidence to break free from passivity. Others start with all their might, trying to counterattack, but lack endurance, indicating they gradually lose confidence. In air combat, by taking different strategies for different situations, one can better maintain the dominant position and achieve victory in air combat.

Bravery is not recklessness; it is built on the foundation of proletarian consciousness, and after scientifically analyzing the situation of both the enemy and ourselves, it produces the thought and action of daring to struggle and daring to win. Only with such a brave spirit can one seize the initiative in air combat with fast, close, accurate, and fierce actions. On July 29, 1958, our squadron's comrades created the famous "three-to-zero" example, which was the result of displaying such a brave spirit and seizing the initiative.

That day, the cloud layer in the battle area was very low, and the cunning enemy aircraft used the cloud layer as cover, flying just above the clouds. If we used the usual method of four aircraft separating and ascending through the clouds, then regrouping and entering the battle after exiting the clouds, it would be very easy for the enemy to discover us first, and we would be attacked before we could regroup. Based on the situation at that time, to seize the initiative, the best method was to fly in formation at low altitude through the clouds, hiding and approaching the enemy, and entering the battle as soon as we exited the clouds. However, our squadron's comrades had not flown in formation at low altitude through the clouds. Flying in formation through the clouds, due to poor visibility, could easily result in colliding with our own aircraft. The lead aircraft commander, Comrade Zhao De'an, to seize the initiative and also considering that everyone had a certain technical foundation, decisively decided to fly in formation at low altitude through the clouds. As soon as we exited the cloud layer, we discovered four enemy aircraft still sneaking just above the clouds. Comrades Zhao De'an, Gao Changji, and others took the enemy by surprise, attacking them when they were unprepared, and fiercely shot down three enemy aircraft.

Of course, air combat is not always so smooth. We also have passive situations. However, Chairman Mao teaches us: "The initiative and victory can be seized from the hands of the dominant and superior by the inferior and passive, based on the actual situation, through the active role of subjective ability, and by obtaining certain conditions." As long as we display the proletarian brave spirit, passivity can be turned into activity. In my first air combat, I encountered such a situation.

That day, twelve enemy aircraft sneaked in low over the sea and then suddenly climbed high. Our squadron's four aircraft and four aircraft from a sister squadron took off to intercept. When we took off, the enemy aircraft had already flown above our heads. The initiative was seized by the enemy, and they were in a dominant position, superior in numbers, altitude, and position, and our aircraft were under the enemy's gunfire. The enemy was very arrogant, shouting madly: "Down there, a good opportunity!" Facing such a passive and dangerous situation, if we were cowardly and hesitated even for a moment, it would result in serious losses. However, we are pilots armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and we were not intimidated by the enemy's arrogance. Each of us was filled with rage, like little tigers, charging up, inserting into the enemy formation, with sudden and fierce movements. In an instant, the enemy and us formed an intertwined situation. We targeted the enemy, and the enemy targeted us. After being targeted by the enemy, we did not retreat but increased our hatred for the enemy and added courage to kill the enemy. The wingman reported: "There's an enemy aircraft behind!" The lead aircraft immediately responded: "Counterattack, turn around!" When the enemy was arrogant, we carried out continuous counterattacks, first suppressing them spiritually. Our squadron's Zhang Yilin was targeted by two enemy aircraft. Zhang Yilin's lead aircraft, Gao Changji, immediately turned around and headed straight for the enemy aircraft. These two air pirates did not dare to fight head-on and hurriedly avoided. At this time, an enemy aircraft, not knowing what to do, rushed in front of Zhang Yilin. Zhang Yilin seized the opportunity, chased it, and with a burst of cannon fire, shot it down.

As we bravely counterattacked, the situation quickly changed. The more we fought, the more courageous we became, and the more the enemy fought, the more panicked they became. At this time, the contradiction changed: the enemy turned from attacking to retreating, from dominant to passive; we turned from defending to attacking, from passive to dominant. This battle, although our situation was dangerous at the beginning, because everyone displayed the spirit of brave fighting and fearlessness of sacrifice, we finally turned passivity into activity, repelled the enemy's attack, and achieved the result of shooting down and damaging two enemy aircraft.

In practice, I deeply realized the decisive role of the brave spirit in seizing the initiative and breaking free from passivity in air combat. In any dangerous situation, as long as one is brave and strong, one can turn passivity into activity, turn inferiority into superiority, turn disadvantage into advantage, and finally achieve victory.

The mark of bravery is "airborne bayonet fighting"

Air combat is a life-and-death struggle. We want to annihilate the enemy, and the enemy wants to annihilate us. We have a magic weapon for defeating the enemy, which is the tactic indicated by Vice Chairman Lin Biao: close combat. This is a tactic of using our strengths to strike the enemy's weaknesses, which can most effectively annihilate the enemy and preserve ourselves.

Our pilots fight very bravely, which is our strength; while the enemy's pilots, although cunning and stubborn, are cowardly and afraid of death, which is their weakness. The enemy's weapons and equipment are generally better than ours, which is their strength; our weapons and equipment are inferior, which is our weakness. In air combat, if we discover the enemy and immediately insert ourselves in front of the enemy for close combat, it will make the enemy's weapons and equipment ineffective, turning their strengths into weaknesses. In this way, we can fully utilize our strengths and annihilate the enemy. In one air combat, our squadron's pilot Wang Mingpan encountered an enemy aircraft. Wang Mingpan immediately rushed in front of the enemy, giving the enemy a sudden psychological shock. Seeing the situation was not favorable, the enemy used the advantageous condition of its aircraft's good turning performance to circle with Wang Mingpan, attempting to escape and seize the opportunity to attack Wang Mingpan. But Wang Mingpan did not give the enemy any breathing room. He held the control stick with both hands, maneuvering the aircraft to tilt and pursue the enemy, entangling with it, making the enemy extremely panicked, only able to defend and unable to counterattack, unable to fully utilize its weapon performance. Wang Mingpan seized the opportunity, pressing closer and closer, entangling with the enemy for fourteen circles, and when he could see the enemy's head clearly, he opened fire. This burst of cannon fire was accurate and fierce, and the enemy aircraft immediately crashed down like a headless fly. This "airborne bayonet fighting" was a victory of fully utilizing human subjective initiative.

In the past, some comrades had such a thought: the aircraft flies so fast, several hundred meters in one second, close combat may result in a collision with the enemy aircraft, and even if the enemy is annihilated, it may not be possible to preserve oneself, so it is better to fight from a distance. Later, we repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's instructions on preserving oneself and annihilating the enemy. Chairman Mao said: "In warfare, annihilating the enemy is the primary objective, preserving oneself is the secondary objective, because only by annihilating a large number of enemies can one effectively preserve oneself." This made us realize that in fighting, one should first focus on annihilating the enemy, and close combat is the best way to annihilate the enemy. Because from a distance, the accuracy of shooting is poor, sometimes not only can the enemy not be hit, but one may also be hit by the enemy's missiles. We shoot rifles on the ground, and even for a fixed target, a little farther and one has to adjust the sights, three points in a line, a little off and one cannot hit. Close up, aiming is simple and easy, sometimes raising the gun and shooting hits. But the enemy and our aircraft are in high-speed motion, and from a distance, aiming accurately is even more difficult. But if one gets close, the accuracy greatly increases. I deeply felt this in actual combat.

Of course, fighter jets have high speeds, and there is the possibility of collision in combat. But fighting is about taking risks, "not entering the tiger's den, how can one catch the tiger?" To annihilate the enemy, one must take some risks. When necessary, we are even willing to sacrifice our lives to ram the enemy aircraft. We are conscious proletarian revolutionary warriors, and for the liberation of all mankind, we are willing to brave the flames and die heroically, with a calm heart, never fearing death. Our death is for the survival of more people, and the sacrifice of individuals brings the preservation of the collective. As long as the people need me to ram the enemy aircraft, I will keep my eyes open, see clearly, aim accurately, operate steadily, ram fiercely, ram with a calm spirit, act naturally, and die with a spirit that lives on; die in a way that makes the enemy tremble, die in a way that inspires the people.

Bravery is our absolute advantage

"Thorough materialists are fearless." Proletarian revolutionary warriors armed with Mao Zedong Thought fear no difficulties, no weapons, no enemies. American imperialism often boasts of its so-called "air superiority," and modern revisionists and some cowards are terrified. But in our eyes, American imperialism's so-called "air superiority" is nothing to be afraid of. What is their so-called superiority? It is nothing more than faster aircraft, air-to-air missiles, longer flight times, etc. These issues, our squadron's comrades have discussed repeatedly. We believe that one should not be superstitious about American imperialism's "superiority," but should use a dialectical viewpoint to correctly view it. Its "superiority" in these aspects is often offset by many irreparable shortcomings it brings. Even if it has some "superiority" in these aspects, this superiority is relative.

Let's analyze these so-called "superiorities" specifically.

"High speed." Some enemy aircraft have high speeds, which is a fact. But with increased speed, the time for aiming and shooting in air combat is shortened, and the accuracy is reduced. Moreover, the faster one flies, the more difficult it is to turn. It's like riding a bicycle; the faster one rides, the bigger the turn; turn too small and one will fall. The same principle applies to aircraft turning. When the enemy aircraft attacks us, we can use the advantage of our slower speed and smaller turning radius to suddenly dodge to the side, and the enemy aircraft will miss and fly ahead; when it turns back, we can seize the opportunity to fiercely attack from the side and shoot it down. Therefore, the enemy aircraft's advantage of high speed is offset by many shortcomings brought by its high speed.

"Carrying missiles." Some enemy aircraft carry air-to-air missiles, which can attack us from a distance. However, carrying missiles makes the aircraft heavier and slower, and less maneuverable, creating opportunities for us. More importantly, missiles can only be fired from a distance, and as long as we dare to get close to the enemy aircraft, the missiles become useless, not only unable to hit us but also easily shot down by us. If not careful, it may even shoot itself down. Last year, an American imperialist aircraft carrying missiles invaded our Hainan Island airspace. As soon as our naval air force approached it, the enemy panicked, firing missiles randomly, not only failing to hit us but also shooting down one of its own aircraft, becoming a laughing stock.

"Long flight time." American imperialism, for the purpose of external aggression, has longer round-trip flight times. But since it is fighting in another country, far from its base, excluding the time for round trips, the actual time for combat is not much. At the same time, long flight times mean more fuel carried, which not only increases the aircraft's weight but also makes it more likely to catch fire and explode if hit by us.

Our understanding of American air pirates' so-called "superiority" is like this. We despise it not only because we have scientifically analyzed its weapons and equipment, but more importantly, we clearly understand Chairman Mao's teaching: "Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor; the decisive factor is people, not things." We know that American aggressors are corrupt and weak. Their pilots are very reactionary and cunning, but also cowardly and afraid of death. Their military and soldiers are in conflict, upper and lower levels are in conflict, and various military branches are in conflict, with many contradictions. Moreover, they are fighting an unjust war, as murderers and robbers, facing opposition everywhere. In combat, they become "deaf" and "blind"; they are far from their base for combat, always in a passive position, facing air strikes and ground anti-aircraft fire networks, making their pilots more terrified in combat. This is the enemy's insurmountable weakness, their absolute inferiority.

In the history of human warfare, it has always been the revolutionary people armed with inferior weapons who have defeated the reactionaries armed with superior weapons. Today, American imperialism is still boasting about its superiority, but you have your "superiority," and I have my superiority; you fight with your "superiority," and I fight with my superiority. Bravery is our absolute superiority. This is something that no enemy can steal or take away, something that no enemy's "superiority" can compare to. We will rely on this spiritual atomic bomb to defeat all enemies!

The source of bravery is Mao Zedong Thought

The bravery of proletarian revolutionary warriors comes from the great Mao Zedong Thought. It is the embodiment of the revolutionary essence of serving the people wholeheartedly, the highest reflection of hatred for the enemy and love for the people, and the embodiment of the determination to never rest until all reactionaries in the world are annihilated and all mankind is liberated.

When we fight against the enemy, we will encounter the issue of life and death. As a soldier of the people's air force, we are prepared to sacrifice ourselves for the people's cause at any time. Chairman Mao teaches us: "To struggle is to have sacrifices, and the death of people is a common occurrence, but we think of the people's interests, think of the suffering of the majority of the people, and we die for the people, dying is worthwhile." Pilots armed with Mao Zedong Thought, their lives belong to the Party, to the people, to the proletariat. We want to live for the Party, live for the people. As long as the people need us, we are fearless of death.

Only by being selfless can one be fearless. Self-interest is the enemy of bravery. Pilots of the people's air force, to dare to fight against the enemy, must first dare to fight against one's own erroneous thoughts; to dare to fight against the enemy with bayonets, must first dare to fight against one's own erroneous thoughts with "bayonets."

I have had such a lesson in this regard.

In one intense air combat, I, as a wingman, provided cover for the lead aircraft to attack the enemy. Suddenly, an enemy aircraft attacked us from the left. I discovered the enemy aircraft and immediately reported to the lead aircraft. At this time, the situation was very favorable for me to attack the enemy. If I had attacked the enemy aircraft, not only could I have annihilated the enemy, but I could have better protected the lead aircraft's safety. But at this time, self-interest hindered me. I was afraid of losing the lead aircraft and not being able to take responsibility, wanting to attack the enemy but not daring to. As a result, I missed the opportunity to attack the enemy. Not only did I not shoot down the enemy aircraft, but I was also almost hit by the enemy aircraft. In this same battle, another wingman in our squadron, under almost the same conditions, focused on annihilating the enemy, actively protected the lead aircraft, and shot down an enemy aircraft. This formed a sharp contrast with me.

I deeply felt that: the more modernized the weapons, the more revolutionary the thoughts of the people who master these weapons must be. The purity of proletarian thoughts must be thousands of times higher than the precision of technology. Sometimes, a slight difference in technological precision is not a big problem, but a slight difference in the purity of proletarian thoughts will have a great impact on the battle. Without self-interest, some victories that seem unattainable can be achieved; with self-interest, some victories that can be achieved cannot be achieved.

In the past, I thought that I was a child from a poor family, with very pure thoughts. Sometimes, when I had flaws, I emphasized that ideological transformation is a long-term process, to be done slowly. Always forgiving myself. Through this battle, I realized: ideological transformation is like fighting a battle, and problems must be eliminated as soon as they appear. Especially when I read Chairman Mao's teaching: "Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the people's interests, making every living person think of them with a heavy heart, so how can we not be willing to sacrifice our personal interests, how can we not be willing to abandon our mistakes?" This passage had a great impact on me, increasing my determination to overcome erroneous thoughts. After realizing this, I resolutely fought against my own thoughts of gain and loss. I welcomed others to point out my flaws, and as soon as they were pointed out, I changed them. After a period of time, I would give myself an account, seeing if the change was thorough. In this way, accumulating small victories into big victories, reducing self-interest, increasing "public" spirit, and naturally increasing courage. In a later air combat, I pursued an enemy aircraft, and when I was about to get close to the enemy aircraft, the ground commander ordered me: "Pull up!" At that time, I was still a bit far from the enemy aircraft, and pulling up early would not be conducive to annihilating the enemy. In the past, I would have mechanically executed the superior's instructions. But this time, I only wanted to annihilate the enemy, not thinking about personal gains and losses, and based on the situation at that time, I judged the situation and continued to fly for a period of time. When I thought the time was appropriate, I pulled up, and finally shot down the enemy aircraft.

I am not saying that I have no self-interest at all. No, it's not like that. Because ideological struggle is long-term, rising and falling, the struggle between proletarian thoughts and bourgeois thoughts is not a matter of one wind prevailing over the other, but of the other wind prevailing over the one. To overcome the enemy in one's thoughts, one must rely on the great Mao Zedong Thought. The more Mao Zedong Thought there is in one's mind, the less self-interest there is, and the more courage there is. Only by reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, can one treat struggle as happiness and dedicating oneself to the revolution as glory.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The era of human warfare will be ended by our hands, and the wars we are waging are undoubtedly part of the final wars." This is the greatest glory, this is the greatest happiness of a revolutionary soldier. If American imperialism insists on imposing war on us, we will resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate it!

　　毛泽东思想给我无穷的智慧和勇气
　　——学习毛主席著作的体会
　　空军某部“航空兵英雄中队”中队长　董小海
    内容提要：无产阶级革命战士的勇敢，来源于伟大的毛泽东思想。我们人民的飞行员，对党和人民无限忠诚，对世界无产阶级革命事业有高度的责任感。勇敢，最高度地集中反映了对敌人的恨，对人民的爱。无私才能无畏。有了勇敢精神，就会信心十足，打出技术，打出智慧；在空战中就能争取主动，保持主动，或由被动转化为主动。我们克敌制胜的法宝是近战，敢于“空中拚刺刀”；勇敢，是我们的绝对优势，我们凭借这个精神原子弹，就能战胜一切敌人。
    林彪同志说：“最大的战斗力是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是勇敢，不怕死。”对这一条真理，过去我是缺乏认识的。我以为飞机是高度精密的现代化武器，没有技术连飞都飞不上去，还打什么仗！打空战，主要是打技术。可是，空战中经常会遇到这样一些问题：面对着技术高于我的敌人敢不敢打？面对着性能优于我的敌机敢不敢打？面对着数量多于我的敌机敢不敢插进去打？敢不敢靠近打？在敌机采用狡猾的伎俩想逃跑时，敢不敢穷追猛打？在自己处于被动的情况下，敢不敢大胆反击？……要回答这些问题，离不开两个字：勇敢。如果不勇敢，就算你有性能最好的飞机，最高超的技术也是白搭！
    勇敢出技术、出智慧
    有人说：“艺高人胆大。”我看这话不对。这是不突出政治，是单纯军事观点的反映。因为它过分强调“艺”的作用，忽视了思想因素；把“艺”放在首位，把思想放在次要地位。
    “艺”的高低是一回事，在空战中能不能充分发挥“艺”，又是一回事。这就要看“艺”是掌握在什么样的人的手里，看他的精神状态如何，有没有勇敢精神。我们是人民的飞行员，对党和人民无限忠诚，对世界无产阶级革命事业有高度的责任感。我们掌握了“艺”，就如虎添翼。即使我们的“艺”暂时还不高，也会凭着最大的勇敢，充分发挥自己的技术，去消灭敌人。我们中队成立不久，有些同志就参加了抗美援朝。那时，他们在歼击机上只飞了二三十小时，技术还不熟练。而他们的对手美国空中强盗大都参加过第二次世界大战，飞过一两千小时。要说“艺高”，美国飞贼可算“艺高”，但是他们胆不大。比较起来，我们的“艺”并不高，可是，由于对美国空中强盗野蛮轰炸朝鲜和我国东北地区的血腥罪行无比愤怒，一见美国飞贼就眼红，揪住就打，一上阵就敲掉三架敌机。“艺高”的美国飞贼却是胆小如鼠，无法充分发挥他们的技术，成了我们的手下败将！
    我们有了勇敢精神，打起仗来，信心十足，头脑清醒，打出技术，打出智慧。为了击落敌机的需要，能做出平时没有做过的技术、战术动作。比如，我们中队的张以林，在一次空战中追击一架敌机，这架敌机由万米高空逃到二三百米的低空，往海上逃。那时，张以林既没有飞过低空，又没有作过海上飞行。但是，他勇敢地追到低空，追到海上，飞出了平时没有掌握的技术。在追击中，速度超过了这种飞机理论的最大性能，机身倾斜得很厉害，张以林机智地把飞机稳住了。他以有我无敌的英雄气概，穷追猛打，终于把敌机打入海底。他的这些技术和智慧，不正是靠无产阶级勇敢精神打出来的吗？
    当然，我们并不否认技术的作用。我们无产阶级战士，有了高度的阶级觉悟，有了大无畏的勇敢精神，加上过硬的技术，如虎添翼，在战场上发挥巨大的威力。“艺”，是战斗力中的一个因素，但不是决定的因素。“艺”是受思想支配的。“艺”不是勇敢的基础，勇敢的基础是人的无产阶级觉悟，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    勇敢可以化被动为主动
    毛主席说：“行动自由是军队的命脉，失了这种自由，军队就接近于被打败或被消灭。”空战，是敌我双方互相争夺主动、避免被动的斗争。
    争取主动，保持主动，或由被动转化为主动，都需要勇敢精神。但是，这种勇敢不是蛮干。我开始参加空战训练，当自己处于主动位置攻击别人的时候，盲目性很大。不管对方是上是下，动作多么复杂，我都是一上阵就猛攻，以为这样才是勇敢，才能保持主动。其实，这样做往往适得其反。我有过这样的教训：有一次我和冯乔政练习打空战，开始的时候，我咬住了他，取得了主动位置。可是我没有找准突破口，盲目乱攻，也没有注意观察、判断对方的动作。冯乔政突然向我的一侧，来了个急上升动作，又马上减小速度，把我闪在一旁去了，接着就向我扑来，弄得我措手不及，主动变成了被动，攻击变成了被攻击。
    从这以后，我在空战中，就注意选择突破口，并且注意对方的动作。但是，打空战不像拚刺刀。拚刺刀，两个人面对面，可以从脸部表情、手势判断出对方的精神状态和动作。打空战是一前一后，看不见对方的面部表情，只能透过敌机的动作来分析敌人的精神状态和企图。比如：有的敌机被我们咬住后，一个劲地生拉硬拽，看来好像很勇猛，实际上他是胆怯，怕被攻上。有的动作犹豫不定，可反击时也不反击，这说明他缺乏摆脱被动的勇气和信心。还有的一开始便使出“程咬金三斧头”的劲头，力图反击，但后劲不足，这说明他逐渐失去信心。在空战中，对各种不同的情况采取不同的对策，就能较好地保持主动位置，取得空战的胜利。
    勇敢不是鲁莽，它是建立在无产阶级觉悟基础之上的，在对敌我双方情况进行科学分析之后，而产生的敢于斗争敢于胜利的思想和行动。只有具备这样的勇敢精神，才能以快、近、准、狠的空战动作夺取空战中的主动权。一九五八年七月二十九日，我们中队的同志创造了有名的“三比零”战例，就是发扬了这样的勇敢精神，取得主动权的结果。
    那天，战区云层很低，狡猾的敌机利用云层作掩护，贴着云层上面飞来。如果我们采用平时四架飞机分开穿云上升，出云后再集合编队投入战斗的方法，那就很容易被敌人先发现，不等我们集合好就会遭到敌人的进攻。根据当时的情况，要争取主动，最好的办法是低空编队穿云，隐蔽接敌，一出云就可投入战斗。但是低空编队穿云，我们中队的同志没有飞过。编队穿云，由于云中视线不清，搞不好会撞上自己的飞机。带队长机赵德安同志，为了争取主动权，同时也考虑到大家有一定的技术基础，果断地决定低空编队穿云。我们一出云层发现四架敌机还鬼鬼祟祟地贴着云层飞。赵德安、高长吉等同志出敌不意，攻其不备，一顿猛打，四架敌机被打落打伤三架。
    当然，打空战并不都是这样顺利的，我们也有被动的时候。但是，毛主席教导我们：“主动和胜利，是可以根据真实的情况，经过主观能力的活跃，取得一定的条件，而由劣势和被动者从优势和主动者手里夺取过来的。”只要我们发扬无产阶级的勇敢精神，被动可以转化为主动。我首次参加空战就遇到这种情况。
    那天，十二架敌机贴着海面偷偷入窜，然后突然爬高。我们中队四架飞机和兄弟中队四架飞机起飞截击。等我们起飞时，敌机已经飞到我们头顶上。主动权被敌人掌握了，他们居高临下，无论数量、高度、位置都占优势，我们的飞机都处在敌机炮口之下。敌人非常嚣张，疯狂地叫喊：“在下面，好机会！”面对这种被动、险恶的形势，如果我们胆怯，稍一犹豫，就会造成严重损失。但是，我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民的飞行员，我们没有被敌人的气焰所吓倒，一个个都是满腔怒火，像小老虎似地冲了上去，插入敌机群，动作又突然又猛烈。霎时间，敌我之间形成犬牙交错的形势。我们咬住敌人，敌人也咬住我们。我们被敌人咬住以后，不是畏惧，而是增加了对敌人的仇恨，增添了杀敌的勇气。僚机一报告：“后面有敌机！”长机马上回答：“反击，扭过来！”在敌人气焰嚣张的时候，我们接连实施反击，首先在精神上把它压下去。我们中队的张以林被两架敌机咬住，张以林的长机高长吉，马上掉转机头，迎头向敌机撞去。这两个飞贼不敢对头打，慌忙避开。这时，一架敌机不知所措地冲到张以林的前面，张以林乘势追上去，抓住这架敌机，一排炮弹就把它“报销”了。
    随着我们英勇的反击，情况迅速发生了变化。我们愈战愈勇，敌人愈战愈慌。这时矛盾就转化了：敌人由攻击转为退却，由主动转化为被动；我们则由防御转为进攻，由被动转化为主动。这次战斗，开始我们的处境险恶，但由于大家发扬了勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲的精神，终于化被动为主动，打退了敌人的进攻，并取得击落击伤敌机两架的战果。
    在实践中，我深深地认识到，勇敢精神对在空战中争取主动、摆脱被动的决定性的作用。在任何危急情况下，只要勇敢坚强，就能够变被动为主动，变劣势为优势，变不利为有利，最后取得胜利。
    勇敢的标志是“空中拚刺刀”
    空战，是你死我活的搏斗。我们要消灭敌人，敌人也想消灭我们。我们有个克敌制胜的法宝，那就是林彪副主席指示我们的：近战。这是以我之长，击敌之短的战术，它能最有效地消灭敌人，保存自己。
    我们的飞行员打仗都非常勇敢，这是我们的长处；而敌人的飞行员虽然狡猾顽固，但贪生怕死，这是它的短处。敌人的武器、装备一般比我们好，这是它的长处；我们的武器装备差些，这是我们的短处。在空战中，如果我们发现敌人后，一下子插到敌人跟前，同敌人近战，就会使它的武器装备的作用发挥不出来，特长变成特短。这样就可以充分发挥我们的长处，消灭敌人。在一次空战中，我们中队的飞行员王铭砚同一架敌机遭遇。王铭砚一下子冲到敌人面前，给敌人精神上一个突然打击。敌人见势不妙，就利用它飞机转弯性能好的有利条件，同王铭砚兜圈子，企图逃脱并且伺机袭击王铭砚。但王铭砚一直不给敌人喘息的机会。他双手抱住驾驶杆，操纵飞机倾斜追击敌人，同它缠斗，使敌人异常慌乱，只有招架之功，没有还手之力，不能充分发挥它的武器性能。王铭砚乘势越逼越近，一直和敌人缠斗了十四圈，等到连敌人的脑袋都看得清楚的时候，才开炮。这一串炮弹打得又准又狠，敌机立刻像没头的苍蝇似的栽了下去。这一场“空中拚刺刀”的战斗，是充分发挥人的主观能动性的胜利。
    过去，有的同志有这样的想法：飞机飞得那么快，一秒钟就是几百米，靠近打，可能和敌机相撞，这样，即使消灭了敌人，但可能保存不了自己，不如远一点打好。后来，我们反复学习了毛主席关于保存自己和消灭敌人的指示。毛主席说：“战争目的中，消灭敌人是主要的，保存自己是第二位的，因为只有大量地消灭敌人，才能有效地保存自己。”这使我们认识到，打仗首先要着眼于消灭敌人，而近战是消灭敌人最好的办法。因为远了，射击准确性差，有时不仅不能击中敌人，还可能被敌人的导弹击中。我们在地面打步枪，就是固定目标，稍远一点还要对标尺，三点成一线，差一点都打不中。离得近，瞄准就简单容易，有时举枪就打中。而敌我双方的飞机是在高速度运动中，在远处要瞄得很准就更困难。但要是靠到跟前，准确性就大大提高了。这一点我在实战中体会得特别深刻。
    当然歼击机速度大，作战中也有相撞的可能性。但打仗就是要有点冒险精神，“不入虎穴，焉得虎子”，要消灭敌人，不冒点风险是不行的。必要的时候，我们甚至要牺牲自己的生命去撞掉敌机。我们是有觉悟的无产阶级战士，为了争取全人类的解放，赴汤蹈火，英勇牺牲，心情坦然，从来不怕死。我们死，是为了更多的人活，个人的牺牲，换来集体的保存。只要人民需要我去撞掉敌机，我就会睁着眼睛，看得清，瞄得准，操纵稳，撞得狠，撞得精神镇定，态度自如，心情舒畅，死而精神长存；死得让敌人发抖，死得让人民受到鼓舞。
    勇敢是我们的绝对优势
    “彻底的唯物主义者是无所畏惧的”。用毛泽东思想武装起来的、自觉的无产阶级革命战士，什么困难都不怕，什么武器都不怕，什么敌人都不怕。美帝国主义经常吹嘘它的所谓“空中优势”，现代修正主义者和一些懦夫吓得要命。但是在我们看来，美帝国主义的所谓“空中优势”，并不是什么了不起的东西。它所谓的优势是什么呢？无非是什么飞机飞得快啦，有空对空导弹啦，空中飞行时间长啦，等等。这些问题，我们中队的同志们曾经反复讨论过。我们认为，对美帝国主义的“优势”不能迷信，要用一分为二的观点来正确看待。它的这些“优势”，往往会被它本身所带来的许多不可补救的缺点所减杀。就算它在这些方面有些“优势”，但这种优势也是相对的。
    让我们具体分析一下它这些所谓“优势”吧。
    “速度大”。有些敌机速度大，这是事实。但速度增大以后，空战时瞄准射击的时间短了，准确性降低了。而且飞得越快，转起弯来越困难。好比骑自行车，跑得越快，转的弯子也越大；转小了就会摔倒。飞机转弯也是这个道理。当敌机攻击我们时，我们就可以利用速度小、转的弯子小的优点，以突然的动作向一旁闪开，敌机就会扑空，冲到前面去；等它转回来时，我们就可以乘势拦腰猛烈攻击，把它打掉。因此，敌机速度大的优势，就为其速度大所带来的许多缺点所减杀。
      “带导弹”。有些敌机上带有空对空导弹，可以在远距离上攻击我们。但是它带了导弹，飞机更加笨重，飞得也慢了，动作也不灵活了，这便给我们造成了可乘之隙。更重要的是，导弹只能在远距离上发射，只要我们大胆靠近敌机，它的导弹就“无用武之地”，不但打不着我们，反而容易被我们打掉。搞得不好，它还自己打掉自己。去年，美帝国主义带导弹的飞机侵入我海南岛上空，我海军航空兵一靠近它，敌人就慌了手脚，胡乱发射导弹，不仅没打着我们，反而把它自己的飞机打掉一架，成为人们的笑柄。
    “在空中飞行时间长”。美帝国主义为了对外侵略，它的飞机往返飞行时间比较长。但由于它是到别国作战，远离基地，除去往返基地的时间，真正用于作战的时间也就没有多少了。同时，飞行时间长，飞机带的油就多，这样，不仅增加了飞机的重量，而且一旦被我们打中，更容易起火爆炸。
    我们对美国空中强盗的所谓“优势”的认识就是这样。我们之所以藐视它，不仅是由于我们对它的武器装备等等作了科学的分析，更重要的是，我们清楚地懂得毛主席这一教导：“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。”我们知道，美国侵略者是腐败的、软弱的。他们的飞行员是很反动、很狡猾的，但又是贪生怕死的。他们的军队官兵对立，上下对立，各军种兵种对立，矛盾重重。再加上它进行的是非正义战争，是凶手，是强盗，处处遭到人民的反对。在作战时他就不能不变成了“聋子”和“瞎子”；他们远离基地作战，处处被动挨打，既遭到空中的打击，又遭到地面防空火网的打击，因而他的飞行员在作战中就会更加恐惧。这是敌人不可克服的弱点，是它的绝对劣势。
    在人类战争史上，历来都是手持劣势武器的革命人民，打败拥有优势武器装备的反革命。今天，美帝国主义还在吹嘘它的这个优势，那个优势，但是，你有你的“优势”，我有我的优势；你打你的“优势”，我打我的优势。勇敢，是我们的绝对优势。这是任何敌人抢不跑、夺不走的，是敌人的任何“优势”所不能比的。我们就凭借这个精神原子弹，战胜一切敌人！
    勇敢来源于毛泽东思想
    我们无产阶级革命战士的勇敢，来源于伟大的毛泽东思想。它是全心全意为人民服务的革命本质的表现，是最高度地集中反映了对敌人的恨，对人民的爱，表现了不消灭世界上的一切反动派、不解放全人类誓不罢休的决心。
    我们同敌人搏斗，就会碰到生和死的问题。作为一个人民空军战士，我们准备随时为人民事业献身。毛主席教导我们说：“要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的，但是我们想到人民的利益，想到大多数人民的痛苦，我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”用毛泽东思想武装起来的歼击机飞行员，生命是属于党的，是属于人民的，是属于无产阶级的。我们要为党而生，为人民而生。只要人民需要，对于死，我们是无所畏惧的。
    无私才能无畏。私心是勇敢的大敌。人民的歼击机飞行员，要敢于同敌人战斗，首先要敢于同自己的错误思想斗；要敢于同敌人刺刀见红，首先要敢于同自己的错误思想“刺刀见红”。
    这方面，我是有过教训的。
    在一次激烈的空战中，我作为一个僚机飞行员掩护长机攻击敌人。突然一架敌机从左面向我们袭来。我发现敌机后，立即向长机报告。这时，情况对我攻击敌人非常有利。如果我向敌机发起攻击，不仅可能消灭敌人，而且可以更好地保护长机的安全。但这时，私心杂念束缚了我。我怕丢掉了长机负不起责任，想攻击敌人又没敢攻击。结果丧失了攻击敌人的机会。不仅没击落敌机，还差点儿被敌机击中。也就在这次战斗中，我们中队的另一个僚机飞行员在差不多相同的条件下，一心一意消灭敌人，用积极的行动掩护了长机，同时击落一架敌机。这和我形成了鲜明的对比。
    我深深体会到：武器愈是现代化，掌握这种武器的人的思想愈要革命化。要求无产阶级思想的纯洁性，要比技术的精确性要高出千百倍。技术上的精确度差一点有时还没关系，但无产阶级思想的纯洁性差一点，对战斗就会产生很大影响。没有私心杂念，有些本来似乎是拿不到的胜利也拿到了；有了私心杂念，有些可以拿到的胜利也拿不到。
    过去我认为，我是一个贫苦家庭出身的孩子，思想很纯洁。有时有了缺点也强调思想改造是长期的，慢慢来。老是原谅自己。通过这次战斗，我体会到：思想改造像打仗一样，问题一经出现就聚而歼之。特别是当我读到毛主席教导的：“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？”这段话对我的震动很大。增加了战胜错误思想的决心。我觉悟到这点以后，就坚决同自己的患得患失的个人主义思想作坚决斗争。有了问题自己揭，也欢迎大家揭，揭出来就改。到了一段时间，我就给自己算一次总账，看改得是否彻底。这样，积小胜为大胜，私心少了，“公”字多了，勇气也自然增加了。在以后的一次空战中，我追击着一架敌机，快接近敌机时，地面指挥员叫我：“拉起来！”这时，我离敌机还远了点，过早拉起来，不利于消灭敌人。要是在过去，我就会机械地执行上级的指示。而这一次我一心想消灭敌人，没想到什么个人得失，就根据当时的情况，审时度势，又继续飞行了一段时间，待我认为适当的时机才拉起来，最后击落了敌机。
    我这样说也不是说我一点私心杂念都没有了。不，不是这样。因为思想斗争是长期的，时起时伏的，无产阶级思想和资产阶级思想的斗争，不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风。要战胜思想上的敌人，必须靠伟大的毛泽东思想。我们头脑里的毛泽东思想多一分，私心杂念就少一分，勇敢也就增一分。只有读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，才能把斗争当幸福，把献身革命当光荣。
    毛主席教导我们：“人类的战争生活时代将要由我们之手而结束，我们所进行的战争，毫无疑义地是属于最后战争的一部分。”这是无上光荣的事业，这是一个革命战士的最大幸福。如果美帝国主义硬要把战争强加在我们头上，我们就坚决、彻底、干净、全部地把它消灭掉！
