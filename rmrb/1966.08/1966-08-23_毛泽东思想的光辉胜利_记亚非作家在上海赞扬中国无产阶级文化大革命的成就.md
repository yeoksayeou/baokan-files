Currently, Shanghai, like other parts of the country, is in the midst of the high tide of the proletarian cultural revolution. At this moment, representatives attending the emergency conference of Asian and African writers visited Shanghai, a city with a glorious revolutionary tradition.

The Asian and African writer friends witnessed firsthand the great achievements of this proletarian cultural revolution. They saw that in the process of thoroughly criticizing and repudiating the old culture of capitalism and feudalism, the brilliant new proletarian culture is shining brightly. They highly praised China's proletarian cultural revolution, saying that it is a major event in the history of world culture, just as the Long March of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army was an unprecedented major event in military history. The great and brilliant Mao Zedong Thought once again demonstrated its powerful force in criticizing the old world and creating a new world.

These Asian and African friends in Shanghai successively watched revolutionary songs and dances created and performed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, which have distinct proletarian characteristics and a strong fighting spirit. They also watched revolutionary literary and artistic works and programs created and performed by revolutionary literary and artistic workers who followed Chairman Mao's literary and artistic direction and went deep into the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers, depicting the heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers. They were deeply attracted by these performances. The large-scale dance drama "The Red Army Is Not Afraid of Long Marches and Hardships," which reflects the history of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army's Long March that shook the world, when it came to the scene of the Zunyi Conference, a radiant image of Chairman Mao appeared on the screen, symbolizing that the Chinese Communist Party had since established the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong in the Central Committee and the entire Party. At this moment, many Asian and African writers excitedly applauded enthusiastically. When the revolutionary modern ballet "The White-Haired Girl" was performed to the scene where Xi'er was rescued from the mountains by the Eighth Route Army, a red sun rose slowly on the screen, and the chorus sang the inspiring and exhilarating song "The Sun is Mao Zedong, the Sun is the Communist Party," the foreign friends were extremely excited. An African writer said to his friend, "After watching this ballet, I really want to go back to my country and join the battle!"

The enthusiasm of the foreign friends for revolutionary literary and artistic performances is indescribable. On the night of the performance of "The White-Haired Girl," the secretary-general of the permanent bureau of the Asian and African Writers' Conference, Senanayake, went to watch the performance despite his illness. After watching the first act, he was deeply attracted. Senanayake and many Asian and African writers praised the Chinese revolutionary literature and art for embodying Chairman Mao's thought that revolutionary culture is a powerful weapon for the people. Senanayake said, "All the Asian and African writer representatives who watched these revolutionary literary and artistic performances were deeply moved." He said, "The plays 'The White-Haired Girl' and 'The Fury of the Palm Grove' can be performed in other countries, which will greatly benefit those who are fighting against imperialism and feudalism."

The Asian and African writers also enthusiastically praised these literary and artistic performances for correctly embodying Chairman Mao's thought that literature and art should first serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, be created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and be used by the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The leader of the Tanzanian Writers' Delegation and the chairman of the Tanzanian Writers' Association, Yahya Muhammad Hassan, said, "In Shanghai and other parts of China, I have seen many literary and artistic performances that reflect the revolutionary spirit of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. This is diametrically opposed to the literature and art of those countries that use cultural poison to harm the people."

The modern Beijing opera "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" reflects a strong revolutionary spirit and fighting spirit, deeply infecting the Asian and African friends. The leader of the Nepalese Writers' Delegation, Siddhi Charan Shrestha, praised, "Modern Beijing opera is one of the achievements of the socialist cultural revolution, not only is the content revolutionary, but the artistic techniques have also been innovated, this is a new victory of Mao Zedong Thought."

On the night when the Shanghai workers, peasants, and soldiers performed for the Asian and African writer representatives, the theater presented a particularly moving scene. When nine PLA soldiers with tree branches on their caps performed the dance "Bayonet Charge" on stage, the Asian and African writers and the audience together, accompanied by the rhythm of the military music and the soldiers' orderly steps, enthusiastically applauded in unison. A foreign writer said, "The 'Bayonet Charge' is so popular because it reflects the thoughts and feelings of the revolutionary people, the people are always ready to strike the invading enemy. The workers, peasants, and soldiers' programs reflect the ideals, wishes, and demands of the revolutionary people, and their sublime feelings of boundless love for Chairman Mao Zedong." The representative from the Somali coast ("French") Muhammad Dahhan, after watching this program, enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!" He criticized those who sing the tune of "peaceful coexistence" on the Vietnam issue. After watching the music and dance evening with the participation of workers, peasants, and soldiers, Dahhan enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!"

The Asian and African writers highly evaluated the revolutionary literary and artistic programs performed in Shanghai, believing that many programs have achieved a high degree of unity between politics and art. The Angolan representative Viriato da Cruz believed, "Although ballet is originally a European art form, 'The White-Haired Girl' is a powerful and optimistic ballet, a ballet heading towards a brilliant future, it represents a new art, and is the most perfect ballet model in the world." Many Asian and African writers held a symposium with the editors, composers, and performers of "The White-Haired Girl." When the performers talked about going deep into the countryside and being close friends of the poor and lower-middle peasants, many Asian and African writers understood more deeply why the performers' performances were so touching. The representative from the Canary Islands, Antonio Cubillo, said, "The White-Haired Girl' is a masterpiece of Chinese art. This work is an outstanding manifestation of the proletarian cultural revolution in drama and art." The Malaysian representative Sharma said, "The success of 'The White-Haired Girl' is the result of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art.' He said, "The appearance of 'The White-Haired Girl' shows us that in the process of the proletariat's destruction of the old and establishment of the new, the expressive power of ballet will reach an infinite height."

Many Asian and African writers praised the fact that workers and peasants have become the masters of culture as a great event. They praised the high political and artistic level of the works created and performed by workers and peasants. The Japanese representative, playwright Terada Nobuyoshi, said, "I saw that the workers and peasants' performances of their own lives were very powerful and had great vigor." He said that this made him understand more deeply the meaning of Chairman Mao's words in "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" that "the life of the people is the inexhaustible source of all literature and art." Terada Nobuyoshi was deeply attracted by Lu Chunling's flute performance. When he learned that Lu Chunling was a worker before liberation, he said, "This is the highest level and most artistically powerful flute soloist I have ever heard in the world."

Many Asian and African writers watched many revolutionary literary and artistic performances in Shanghai, which left a deep impression on them. They all expressed their desire to learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought to strengthen the struggle against imperialism, old and new colonialism, and modern revisionism, and to strive to create new culture and literature and art that are anti-imperialist, for the people, and national.

    毛泽东思想的光辉胜利
    ——记亚非作家在上海赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命的成就
    当前，上海和全国各地一样，正处在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中。正在这个时刻，参加亚非作家紧急会议的代表们，访问了具有光荣革命传统的上海。
    亚非作家朋友们亲眼看到了这场无产阶级文化大革命不断地取得了伟大的成就。他们看到，在大破资本主义、封建主义的旧文化的过程中，灿烂夺目的无产阶级新文化正在大放异彩。他们高度评价中国的无产阶级文化大革命说，这是世界文化史上的大事件，正如中国工农红军当年向延安进军的长征，是世界军事史上无比的大事件一样。伟大的光辉的毛泽东思想再一次显示出了批判旧世界、创造新世界的强大威力。
    这些亚非朋友们在上海先后观看了广大工农兵创作和演出的具有鲜明无产阶级特性和强烈战斗气息的革命歌舞，观看了革命文艺工作者遵循毛主席的文艺方向，深入工农兵生活，所创作和演出的表现工农兵英雄人物的许多革命文艺作品和节目。他们被这些演出深深地吸引着。反映震撼世界的中国工农红军长征历史的大型组舞《红军不怕远征难》，当演到《遵义会议》一场，天幕上出现了光芒四射的毛主席像，象征着中国共产党从此确立了毛泽东同志在中央和全党的领导。这时，许多亚非作家激动地热烈鼓掌。革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》演到喜儿从深山中被八路军救出，天幕上一轮红日冉冉上升，伴唱席上响起了“太阳就是毛泽东，太阳就是共产党”的振奋人心的激昂歌声时，外国朋友们的情绪异常激动。一位非洲作家对他的朋友说：“看了这个芭蕾舞剧，我真想马上回国去参加战斗！”
    外国朋友们对待革命文艺演出的热情是难以形容的。在《白毛女》演出的那天晚上，亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克抱病前去观看。他看完了第一场，就深深地被吸引住了。森纳那亚克和许多亚非作家赞扬中国革命文艺体现了毛主席关于革命文化对于人民大众是革命的有力武器的思想。森纳那亚克说：“我们所有亚非作家代表观看了这些革命文艺演出都深受感动。”他说：“《白毛女》和《椰林怒火》这两个戏都可以到其他国家去演出，这将会给那些同帝国主义、封建主义作斗争的人们带来莫大的好处。”
    亚非作家们还热烈赞扬这些文艺演出正确体现了毛主席关于文艺首先是为工农兵服务，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的思想。坦桑尼亚作家代表团团长、坦桑尼亚作家协会主席叶海雅·穆罕默德·哈桑尼说：“我在上海和中国其他地方看了许多文艺演出，它们都是反映工农兵革命精神面貌的。这和那些用文化毒素来毒害人民的那些国家的文艺，是针锋相对的。”
    《智取威虎山》这出新京剧反映的强烈的革命精神和斗争气息，深深地感染着亚非朋友。尼泊尔作家代表团团长西迪·查兰·什雷斯塔赞扬说：“现代京剧是社会主义文化大革命的成就之一，不仅内容是革命的，而且艺术手法也有了新的创造，这是毛泽东思想的新胜利。”
    上海工农兵为亚非作家代表演出的那天晚上，剧院里出现了特别激动人心的场面。当军帽上插着树枝条的九名解放军战士在舞台上演出《拚刺刀》的舞蹈时，亚非作家们和观众一起，伴随着军乐的节奏和战士们的整齐步伐，热烈地齐声鼓掌。一位外国作家说：“《拚刺刀》这样受欢迎，这是因为它反映了革命人民的思想感情，人民随时准备着打击侵略的敌人。工农兵的节目表现了革命人民的理想、愿望、要求，和他们对毛泽东主席无限热爱的崇高感情。”索马里海岸（“法属”）代表穆罕默德·达汉看了这个节目后说：“毛泽东主席告诉我们，只要帝国主义存在一天，就永远不能把武器丢掉。现在对一些亚非国家来说，要使人民组织起来，就要拿起武器同帝国主义战斗。”他还批判了在越南问题上高唱“和平共处”谰调的那些人。达汉看完有工农兵参加演出的这个音乐舞蹈晚会后，热情地高呼：“毛泽东主席万岁！”
    亚非作家们对上海演出的革命文艺节目给予高度评价，他们认为许多节目达到了政治和艺术的高度统一。安哥拉代表维里亚托·达克鲁斯认为，“芭蕾舞虽然原是欧洲的艺术形式，但《白毛女》是强有力的、富有乐观精神的芭蕾舞，是走向光辉前途的芭蕾舞，它代表着新的艺术，是世界上最完美的芭蕾舞典范。”许多亚非作家和《白毛女》的编导、作曲者、演员们举行了座谈会。当演员们向他们谈到深入农村，做贫下中农的贴心人，因此能在舞台上表达出贫下中农的感情时，许多亚非作家就更深刻地了解到为什么演员们的表演是如此感人肺腑。加那利群岛代表安东尼奥·库比洛说：“《白毛女》是中国的艺术杰作。这部作品是无产阶级文化大革命在戏剧和艺术上的杰出表现。”马来亚代表沙尔玛说：“《白毛女》的创作成功是活学活用毛泽东主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的结果。”他说：“《白毛女》的出现，向我们显示了在无产阶级破旧立新的创造过程中，芭蕾舞的表现力将会达到无限的高度。”
    许多亚非作家盛赞工农兵做了文化的主人是一件大事。他们赞扬工农兵自己创作和演出的作品具有很高的政治性和艺术性。日本代表、剧作家寺田信义说：“我看到工农兵自己表演自己生活的作品表演力极强，而且很有魄力。”他说，这使他更深刻地理解到毛主席在《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中所说的人民生活是“一切文学艺术的取之不尽、用之不竭的唯一的源泉”的意义。寺田信义被陆春龄的笛子演奏深深吸引住了。当他知道陆春龄解放前是工人时，他说：“这是我所听到过的世界各国笛子独奏家中水平最高，最有艺术表演力的演奏家。”
    许多亚非作家在上海观看了很多革命文艺演出，给他们留下深刻的印象。他们纷纷表示要学习和应用毛泽东思想，来加强进行反对帝国主义、新老殖民主义和现代修正主义的斗争，以及努力创造反帝的、人民大众的、民族的新文化、新文艺。
