The Party Central Committee's decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is brilliant, great, and timely. We are immensely joyful and enthusiastic, fully supporting it a thousand times, ten thousand times, and countless times. We cheer: Long live Chairman Mao!

This decision is a summary of the experiences of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, a programmatic document, and a new development of Marxism. It has great significance for the revolutionary people of China and the world. This decision embodies the most thorough mass line and the most thorough class line. The Communist Party of China is the core force leading our cause, and the people are the creators of history. Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China, and there would be no Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We have unlimited trust in the Party and its policies. The Party and Chairman Mao regard us workers, peasants, and soldiers as the main force of the Cultural Revolution, which is the greatest trust and the greatest honor for us. We will resolutely respond to the Party's call with practical actions, daring to make a revolution, daring to sweep away all monsters and demons, and daring to sweep away all the old systems, old thoughts, old cultures, old habits, and old customs created by the exploiting classes. We will dare to establish new systems, new cultures, new thoughts, new habits, and new customs of the proletariat. We will fear neither heaven nor earth, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat's hard bones, launch the storm of the Cultural Revolution, and thoroughly defeat the anti-Party and anti-socialist clique until the final victory.

Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon for the revolutionary people of the world and the action guide for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works in the practical struggle of the Cultural Revolution, arm our minds, brighten our eyes, and enhance our discernment to complete the historical task of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In the Cultural Revolution, we pilots and all the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army will definitely heighten our revolutionary vigilance, firmly grasp our weapons, defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, defend the Party Central Committee, and defend Mao Zedong Thought.

Long live the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought!
Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!
Long live Chairman Mao!
Wáng Jiāng, Commander of a Flight Squadron of a Certain Air Force Unit

　　“敢”字当头　破旧立新
    党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定，太英明了，太伟大了，太及时了，我们无限欢欣鼓舞，一千个拥护，一万个拥护，万万个拥护。我们欢呼：毛主席万岁！
    这个决定是我国无产阶级文化大革命经验的总结，是一个纲领性文件，是马克思主义的新发展，对我国和世界革命人民都有伟大的意义。这个决定体现了最彻底的群众路线和最彻底的阶级路线。中国共产党是领导我们事业的核心力量，人民群众是历史的创造者，没有共产党就没有新中国，也就没有无产阶级文化大革命。我们无限相信党，相信党的方针政策。党和毛主席把我们工农兵当成文化大革命的主力军，这是对我们的最大信任，是我们的最大光荣。我们坚决以积极投入文化大革命的实际行动响应党的号召，我们要敢于革命，敢于横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，横扫一切剥削阶级造成的旧制度，旧思想，旧文化，旧习惯，旧风俗，敢于创立无产阶级的新制度，新文化，新思想，新习惯，新风俗。我们要天不怕，地不怕，发扬无产阶级硬骨头的革命精神，掀起文化大革命的风暴，彻底打垮反党反社会主义黑帮，直到最后胜利。
    毛泽东思想是世界革命人民的灯塔，是无产阶级文化大革命的行动指南，我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在文化大革命的斗争实践中，活学活用毛主席著作，武装我们的头脑，擦亮我们的眼睛，提高我们的识别能力，胜利地完成无产阶级文化大革命的历史任务。在文化大革命中，我们飞行员和人民解放军全体指战员一起，一定要提高革命警惕，紧握手中武器，捍卫无产阶级文化大革命，捍卫党中央，捍卫毛泽东思想。
    伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
