Seeing Through the Paper Tiger, Not Fearing the Paper Tiger, Overthrowing the Paper Tiger
Burma and Congo (Brazzaville) Figures Say Chairman Mao's Judgment on Paper Tigers Arms the Revolutionary People of Asia, Africa, and Latin America

According to Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, August 17th: Recently, U Aung Zan, an executive committee member of the Burma Peace Committee, spoke to a Xinhua News Agency reporter and said that Chairman Mao Zedong's famous and wise judgment, made twenty years ago during his conversation with American journalist Anna Louise Strong, that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers, has been proven correct by the historical facts of the past twenty years. This judgment is correct now and will remain correct in the future.

He said: "The people of Burma, together with the great Chinese people, the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the people of other parts of the world, will, under the guidance of this judgment, surely defeat all reactionaries, revisionists, and imperialists led by the United States—they are all paper tigers with paper teeth." U Aung Zan pointed out, "The American paper tiger, which was once beaten by the Korean and Chinese people, is now showing its fangs in Vietnam. However, the heroic Vietnamese people clearly know that this American paper tiger will be torn to shreds through people's war." U Aung Zan said: "Chairman Mao said in this conversation, 'The decisive factor in war is the people, not a few pieces of new weapons.' This statement is very good and has been proven by countless events around the world."

He continued: "For many years, the great Chinese people have fought tirelessly and proven that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. Under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China led by Chairman Mao Zedong, they have finally achieved victory. Today, the People's Republic of China stands proudly and strongly, serving as the brightest beacon for all oppressed and revolutionary people around the world."

U Aung Zan also pointed out: "To fight against imperialism and reactionaries, we must oppose revisionism. Revisionism is the faithful accomplice of imperialism and reactionaries."

According to Xinhua News Agency, Brazzaville, August 17th: Various circles in Congo (Brazzaville) have enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao's wise judgment that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. They pointed out that Chairman Mao's judgment has inspired the revolutionary struggle of the Congolese (Brazzaville) people, and Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon illuminating the path forward for the oppressed people.

The Executive Committee of the National Union of Artists and Writers of Congo (Brazzaville) recently wrote a letter to Chinese artists and writers to congratulate Chairman Mao on the twentieth anniversary of his talk about imperialism and all reactionaries being paper tigers. The letter said, "Chairman Mao's judgment made twenty years ago is still universally applicable to Latin America, Africa, and Asia, where the people are fighting against the conspiracies of imperialism led by the United States." The letter said: "This theory is alive and practical for any historical period, whether now or in the future."

Jean Dedieu Banzouzi, deputy editor-in-chief of the organ of the youth organization of the National Revolutionary Movement of Congo (Brazzaville), _New Forces_, recently told a Xinhua News Agency reporter: "Chairman Mao said that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers, and that is correct. Indeed, because they represent reactionary forces, while we stand on the progressive side." He said: "The bombs used by the Americans in South Vietnam are nothing but paper tigers." The struggle of the Vietnamese people shows that "American imperialists and all reactionaries in the world appear strong but are actually weak."

Beri Madan, the first vice-chairman of the youth organization of the National Revolutionary Movement of Congo (Brazzaville), enthusiastically praised Mao Zedong Thought as "an active contribution to Marxist-Leninist theory and the struggle of the proletariat." He pointed out: "Chairman Mao's judgment that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers has been concretely applied to the various liberation struggles currently underway."

Olaï Lambé, chairman of the 15th branch of the National Revolutionary Movement of Congo (Brazzaville), told a Xinhua News Agency reporter that Chairman Mao's judgment that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers has given him great encouragement. He said, "Chairman Mao's judgments are all truths. He is like a beacon, guiding the people of the world towards true progress."

Recently, a Xinhua News Agency reporter visited this branch. In an African thatched house surrounded by tropical palm trees, the reporter met with members of this branch, who are militiamen, students, and workers. They all have boundless respect and affection for Chairman Mao. They greatly love Chairman Mao's works, cherish Chairman Mao's photographs, and consider wearing a badge with Chairman Mao's image on their shirts to be a great honor.

A young member of the branch told the reporter that Chairman Mao's works on imperialism and all reactionaries being paper tigers and the article "Carry the Revolution Through to the End" gave him great courage and determination to oppose imperialist subversive plots. Another young person said: "The United States has completely exposed itself as a paper tiger in its aggressive war in Vietnam." A young person interjected with a smile: "Youlou [former reactionary head of state of Congo (Brazzaville)] is also a paper tiger, and now he is finished."

　　缅甸和刚果（布）人士说毛主席关于纸老虎的论断武装了亚非拉革命人民
    据新华社仰光十七日电　缅甸保卫世界和平委员会执行委员吴昂扎最近在这里向新华社记者发表谈话说，毛泽东主席二十年前在和美国记者安娜·路易斯·斯特朗谈话时提出的关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎这一著名的英明论断已经被二十年来世界的史实证明是正确的，这论断现在正确，将来也仍然是正确的。
    他说：“缅甸人民和伟大的中国人民、亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民以及世界其他地方的人民一起，在这一论断的指导下，定将战胜以美国为首的一切反动派、修正主义和帝国主义——他们都是长着纸牙齿的纸老虎。”吴昂扎指出，“曾经遭到朝鲜人民和中国人民痛击的（美国）纸老虎现在又在越南张牙舞爪，但是英雄的越南人民清楚地知道，通过人民战争，这只美国纸老虎将被撕得粉碎。”吴昂扎说：“毛主席在这次谈话中说，‘决定战争胜败的是人民，而不是一两件新式武器。’这个说法非常好，它已为全世界许许多多事情所证明。”
    他接着说：“许多年来，伟大的中国人民不懈地战斗，并且证明，帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。在以毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党的正确领导下，他们终于取得了胜利。今天，中华人民共和国自豪地、强大地屹立着，它是照耀全世界一切被压迫人民和革命人民的最明亮的灯塔。”
    吴昂扎还指出：“要同帝国主义和反动派作斗争，我们就必须反对修正主义。修正主义就是帝国主义和反动派的忠实帮凶。”
    据新华社布拉柴维尔十七日电　刚果（布）各界人士热烈赞扬毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断。他们指出，毛主席的论断鼓舞了刚果（布）人民的革命斗争，毛泽东思想是照亮被压迫人民前进的灯塔。
    刚果（布）艺术家、作家全国联合会执行委员会最近写信给中国艺术家和作家，祝贺毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的谈话发表二十周年。信中说，毛主席在二十年前提出的论断“今天依然普遍适用于拉丁美洲、非洲和亚洲，这些地区的人民正在为反对以美国为首的帝国主义的阴谋而斗争。”这封信说：“这一理论不论在现在或将来，对于任何历史时期都是活生生的和有实际意义的。”
    刚果（布）全国革命运动青年组织的机关刊物《新生力量》副总编辑让·德迪厄·邦祖齐最近对新华社记者说：“毛主席说帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎，这话说得对。确实是这样。因为他们代表反动势力，而我们是站在进步方面。”他说：“美国人在南越使用的炸弹不过是纸老虎。”越南人民的斗争说明，“美帝国主义者和世界上一切反动派貌似强大，实际上是虚弱的”。
    刚果（布）全国革命运动青年组织第一副主席贝里·马丹热烈赞扬毛泽东思想“是对马克思列宁主义理论和无产阶级斗争的积极贡献。”他指出：毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的论断，“已经被具体运用到当前进行的各种解放斗争中。”
    刚果（布）全国革命运动第十五支部主席奥拉伊·朗贝尔对新华社记者说：毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的论断给了他极大的鼓舞。他说，毛主席的论断都是真理。他像明灯，引导世界人民走向真正的进步。
    新华社记者最近访问了这个支部。在一所四周都种有热带棕榈树的非洲茅屋里，记者会见了这个支部的成员，他们是民兵、学生和工人。他们对毛主席都怀有无限敬仰和爱戴的感情。他们十分热爱毛主席的著作，十分珍爱毛主席的照片，并且认为在衬衣上挂着有毛主席像的纪念章是极大的光荣。
    支部的一位青年成员对记者说，毛主席论述帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的著作和《将革命进行到底》这篇文章，使他获得了巨大的勇气和决心去反对帝国主义的颠覆阴谋。另外一位青年说：“美国在侵略越南的战争中已经完全暴露了它是纸老虎。”一位青年插进来笑着说：“尤卢〔刚果（布）前反动政权首脑〕也是纸老虎，现在他完蛋了。”
