The industrial frontline workers in Jiangsu Province have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized politics, actively participated in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, initiated a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, greatly strengthened the ideological revolution of the people, and promoted the deep development of the production and economy movement, achieving a comprehensive new leap in industrial production that is fast, good, and economical.

In the first half of this year, the province's total industrial output value increased by 19.5% compared to the same period last year, reaching the highest level since the founding of the nation. The output of most products has increased significantly, especially products that support agriculture and those urgently needed by the state, which have seen even greater increases. The quality of most products has steadily improved, and new products have increased significantly. Nanjing City alone has successfully developed nearly a hundred new products, some of which have reached the advanced level of the 1960s.

As early as the fourth quarter of last year, industrial leadership departments and enterprises in various parts of Jiangsu summarized their past work under the guidance of Chairman Mao's works and prepared for the Third Five-Year Plan. At the beginning of this year, various enterprises organized workers to study Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought as a guideline, extensively studied and discussed the situation, tasks, and great significance of the Third Five-Year Plan, conducted universal education on internationalism to support Vietnam against America and aid world revolution, greatly arousing the political enthusiasm of the workers, and quickly initiating a wave of production and economy competition.

In March and April, industrial leadership departments and enterprises in various places carried out a major inspection and debate to emphasize politics, making various levels of cadres realize the great strategic significance of emphasizing politics and running enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought, realizing that socialist enterprises must regard cultivating and fostering proletarian revolutionary laborers as the primary task, and realizing that emphasizing politics must be implemented in the ideological revolution of the people.

"Whatever Chairman Mao says, we will do it." Workers in various industries, through studying Chairman Mao's works, have elevated the practice of thrift and opposition to waste to the level of promoting revolution and eliminating capitalism, fighting against the decadent practices of the bourgeoisie, and greatly carrying forward the fine traditions of hard struggle of the proletariat.

People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the bravest and most intelligent. In the first half of the year, the majority of workers repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," broke the authority of the bourgeoisie, and carried forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to catch up and surpass, daring to venture and innovate, showing astonishing creative abilities in the technological innovation and technological revolution movement. In the first half of the year, the number of major technological innovation projects implemented in the province exceeded that of last year, and various industries have promoted and adopted a number of new technologies, new processes, new equipment, new materials, and new designs.

The majority of workers have used Chairman Mao's teaching of "one divides into two" as a sharp weapon, breaking the metaphysical view of the bourgeoisie, establishing the idea of continuous revolution, fully mobilizing people's subjective initiative, and tapping into greater potential for production and economy. The pesticide "Lechu" workshop of Suzhou Chemical Factory produced only over 1,100 tons last year. This year, all the workers in the factory seriously studied Chairman Mao's relevant instructions, criticized the ideas of "seeing things but not people" and "the original equipment capacity has been fully utilized," summarized production experience on one hand, and carried out technological transformation on the other, resulting in an increase of four times the production capacity of "Lechu" with only 200,000 yuan.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Guiyang on the 3rd, the broad masses of workers in the industrial, transportation, and basic construction sectors in Guizhou, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have broken the bourgeois ideology and promoted the proletarian ideology, powerfully promoting the comprehensive development of production and construction. In the first half of this year, the province's total industrial output value has increased significantly compared to the same period last year. More than 40 major products, including steel, cotton cloth, and cotton yarn, have completed more than half of the state plan, and a large number of new products have been successfully developed. The transportation and basic construction tasks have also been well completed.

With the mastery of Mao Zedong Thought, many long-standing "difficult problems" have been solved in the cultural revolution; many products that were not produced or dared not be manufactured in the past have been produced. The Guiyang Paper Factory, which was previously controlled by bourgeois technical "authorities," had long had unstable quality for its No. 2 typewriter paper. During the cultural revolution, the workers overthrew the bourgeois "authorities," boldly reformed the production technology, significantly improved the quality of No. 2 typewriter paper, and in June, the pass rate of finished products reached over 93%, setting a new record for the quality of typewriter paper in this factory.

The broad masses of workers also followed Chairman Mao's teaching that "human beings must constantly summarize experience, discover, invent, create, and progress," carried out technological innovation and technological revolution, and changed the backward production situation in many aspects. For example, the Guiyang Woodworking Factory, known for its technological innovation, has recently manufactured unloading machines, nailing machines, and other machinery in the past few months, filling the gap in mechanized production in the factory.

The cultural revolution has further promoted the improvement of enterprise management and more firmly established the direction of running enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought. Since this year, various local factories and enterprises have organized more than 1,000 "light cavalry teams" to support agriculture, going deep into the countryside to help repair, install irrigation machinery, set up and inspect agricultural power grids, repair and forge small agricultural tools and water conservancy tools on the spot, and have been welcomed by the people of all ethnic groups.

The broad masses of workers have deeply criticized the bourgeois and revisionist ideas of "bonus as the leader" and "profit as the leader," as well as the erroneous understanding that "emphasizing politics must be implemented in business," followed Chairman Mao's teachings, fully mobilized the positive factors of the people, and brought into play the revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers.

    思想革命化带动了工业生产的全面跃进
    江苏上半年工业总产值创造建国以来同期最高水平
    贵州四十多种主要工业产品完成国家计划一半以上
    据新华社南京三日电江苏省工业战线广大职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，积极参加无产阶级文化大革命，掀起群众性活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，大大加强了人的思想革命化，促进了增产节约运动深入开展，取得了工业生产多快好省的全面新跃进。
    今年上半年全省工业生产总产值比去年同期增长了百分之十九点五，创造了建国以来上半年生产的最高水平。大部分产品的产量有显著增长，特别是支援农业的产品和国家急需的产品，增长幅度更大。绝大部分产品的质量稳步提高，新产品大量增加。南京市试制成功的新产品有近百种之多，其中有些产品达到了六十年代的先进水平。
    早在去年第四季度，江苏各地工业领导部门和厂矿企业就以毛主席著作为指导方向总结了过去的工作，为迎接第三个五年计划作好了准备。今年年初，各企业又组织职工大学毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想为指针，广泛学习和讨论了第三个五年计划的形势、任务和伟大的意义，普遍进行了援越抗美、支援世界革命的国际主义教育，大大激发了职工群众的政治热情，迅速掀起了比学赶帮超的增产节约热潮。三、四月份，各地工业领导部门和各厂矿企业展开了突出政治的大检查、大辩论，使各级干部认识到突出政治、按照毛泽东思想办企业的伟大战略意义，认识到社会主义企业必须把培养和造就无产阶级的革命化的劳动者当作首要任务，认识到突出政治必须落实到人的思想革命化。
      “毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做。”各行各业职工通过学习毛主席著作，把厉行节约、反对浪费提到兴无灭资的高度来认识，同铺张浪费的资产阶级腐朽作风作斗争，大大发扬了艰苦奋斗的无产阶级优良传统。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的人最勇敢，最聪明。上半年，广大职工反复学习了毛主席的《实践论》、《矛盾论》等文章，大破资产阶级“权威”，发扬了敢赶敢超、敢闯敢创的革命精神，在技术革新和技术革命运动中表现了惊人的创造才能。上半年全省实现的重大技术革新项目多于去年，各行各业都推广和采用了一批新技术、新工艺、新设备、新材料和新设计。
    广大职工把毛主席教导的“一分为二”的观点作为锐利武器，破除资产阶级形而上学的观点，树立了不断革命的思想，充分发挥了人的主观能动性，挖出了更大的增产节约潜力。苏州化工厂的农药“乐果”车间，去年的产量只有一千一百多吨。今年，全厂职工认真学习了毛主席的有关指示，批判了一些人的“见物不见人”和“原有设备能力已经发挥到顶”的思想，一面总结生产经验，一面大搞技术改造，结果只花了二十万元，就使“乐果”的生产能力增加四倍。
    据新华社贵阳三日电贵州工业、交通、基本建设战线广大职工，在无产阶级文化大革命中，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，大破资产阶级思想，大兴无产阶级思想，有力地促进了生产建设的全面发展。今年上半年，全省工业总产值比去年同期有大幅度地增长，钢、棉布、棉纱等四十多种主要产品都完成国家计划的一半以上，还试制成功了大量新产品。交通运输和基本建设任务也完成得很好。
    广大职工掌握了毛泽东思想，许多长期没有解决的“老大难”问题在文化大革命中解决了；许多过去不能生产、不敢制造的产品生产出来了。贵阳造纸厂过去在资产阶级技术“权威”的把持下，生产的二号打字纸质量长期不稳定。在文化大革命中，工人们打倒了资产阶级“权威”，对生产技术大胆进行改革，使二号打字纸的质量显著提高，六月份成品率达到百分之九十三以上，创造了这个工厂打字纸质量的最新纪录。
    广大职工还遵循毛主席的“人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进”的教导，大搞技术革新、技术革命，在许多环节上改变了落后的生产面貌。例如，以技术革新闻名的贵阳木工厂，最近几个月就先后制成了卸车机、压钉机等机器，填补了厂内机械化生产的空白。
    文化大革命进一步推动了企业管理工作的改进，更加坚定了按毛泽东思想办企业的方向。今年以来，各地厂矿企业组织了一千多个支援农业“轻骑队”，深入农村，帮助检修、安装排灌机具，架设、检查农用电网，就地修补、打造小农具和水利工具，受到各族社员的欢迎。
    广大职工在文化大革命中深入地批判了“奖金挂帅”、“利润挂帅”等资产阶级思想和修正主义观点，以及“突出政治必须落实在业务上”等错误认识，遵照毛主席的教导，充分调动人的积极因素，发挥广大职工的革命积极性和创造性。
