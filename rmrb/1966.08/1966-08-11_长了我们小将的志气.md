We firmly support the Party Central Committee's decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! This wise and great decision is the highest directive for us to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the great program for the new stage of the socialist revolution, and the action guideline for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It shines like the sun, illuminating the path forward for us young revolutionaries. This wise decision is another great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. It has boosted the spirit of us young revolutionaries and crushed the arrogance of all ghosts and snakes.

Dearest Party, dearest Chairman Mao, please rest assured! Under your leadership, we will definitely, in the course of the movement, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We will firmly implement the Central Committee's decision in our actual actions, resolutely fight against those in power who are taking the capitalist road, resolutely criticize bourgeois academic "authorities," resolutely criticize the ideology of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, reform education, reform literature and art, reform all superstructures that do not suit the socialist economic base, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

　　长了我们小将的志气
    我们坚决拥护党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定！这一英明伟大的决定是我们进行无产阶级文化大革命的最高指示，是社会主义革命新阶段的伟大纲领，是无产阶级文化大革命的行动指南，它象阳光一样照亮了我们革命小将的前进道路。这一英明决定是毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利，它长了我们革命小将的志气，灭了一切牛鬼蛇神的威风。
    最敬爱的党，最敬爱的毛主席，请您们放心吧！在您们的领导下，我们一定在运动中读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，把中央决定坚决贯彻到实际行动中去，狠斗走资本主义道路的当权派，狠批资产阶级学术“权威”，狠批资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的意识形态，改革教育，改革文艺，改革一切不适于社会主义经济基础的上层建筑，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
