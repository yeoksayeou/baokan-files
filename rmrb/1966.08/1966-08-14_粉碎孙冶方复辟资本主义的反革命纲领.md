Edition: 5

Sun Yefang is a counter-revolutionary revisionist who opposes the Party and socialism. He is a reactionary "authority" in the field of bourgeois economics. For a long time, he has occupied a leading position in the Institute of Economics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, spreading a large amount of black goods imported from Soviet modern revisionism, and engaging in frenzied activities against the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought. Since the 20th Congress of the CPSU, he has become a mouthpiece for Khrushchev's modern revisionism. He has been shouting loudly against Mao Zedong Thought, against the Party's general line for socialist construction, advocating profit as the guiding principle and enterprise autonomy, and proposing a set of counter-revolutionary revisionist economic programs. His goal is to attempt to dismantle our socialist public ownership, to make the socialist economy degenerate and change, to drag our country onto the road of capitalist restoration, and to restore bourgeois dictatorship. We must thoroughly criticize Sun Yefang's counter-revolutionary revisionist economic program, defend Mao Zedong Thought, defend our country's socialist system, and smash the counter-revolutionary plot to restore capitalism.

Attempting to Overthrow the Leading Position of Mao Zedong Thought and Maliciously Attacking the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction

Great Mao Zedong Thought is the biggest obstacle to the counter-revolutionary restoration activities of all anti-Party and anti-socialist elements. All anti-Party and anti-socialist elements always direct their attacks first at Mao Zedong Thought. The "Three Family Village" clique is like this, and so is the literary and artistic black line led by Zhou Yang. Sun Yefang, this old counter-revolutionary, is also like this. Sun Yefang harbors a deep class hatred for Mao Zedong Thought and viciously slanders Mao Zedong Thought as "traditional dogmatism" and "natural economy theory." He claims that "traditional dogmatism" and "natural economy theory" in our country "occupy an unspoken dominant position," "deeply influence current theory and practice," and cause a series of serious "problems" and "evil consequences," suffocating the entire socialist system. He claims that Mao Zedong Thought is all about "emptiness," and when it is summarized as the general line of "building socialism with great effort, striving to catch up and surpass, and building socialism quickly, efficiently, and economically," it becomes even more "empty," and the effort is purely spiritual. He openly denies the leading position of Mao Zedong Thought and loudly calls for the abolition of Mao Zedong Thought's leadership in the economic field and the abolition of the Party's general line for socialist construction. His fundamental purpose is to implement his counter-revolutionary revisionist economic program and to lead our country's socialist economy onto the road of capitalist restoration.

In the cause of socialist construction in our country, whether we adhere to Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle and whether we adhere to the implementation of the Party's general line for socialist construction is a matter of primary importance concerning whether our country follows the socialist road or the capitalist road, and it is a fundamental issue concerning the fate and future of our country.

Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Mao Zedong Thought is Marxism-Leninism in the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards world victory. It is our guide for socialist revolution and socialist construction, and it is a powerful ideological weapon to defeat imperialism and modern revisionism. Mao Zedong Thought in our country indeed occupies an "unsaid dominant position." The dominant position of Mao Zedong Thought is precisely what our seven hundred million people absolutely need and strive to defend. Mao Zedong Thought has led us to achieve one victory after another in our socialist revolution and socialist construction. Mao Zedong Thought is what all class enemies fear the most and hate the most. In our society, class, class contradictions, and class struggle still exist. In the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between the socialist road and the capitalist road, it is either the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind or the West Wind prevailing over the East Wind; it is either Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought occupying the dominant position or capitalist and revisionist thought occupying the dominant position; it is either the proletariat occupying the dominant position or the bourgeoisie occupying the dominant position. There is no other way. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all our work, the fundamental guarantee for the victory of all our revolutionary causes, the red sun in our hearts, the lifeline of our existence, and the source of all our strength. With the dominant position of great Mao Zedong Thought, there is the dominant position of the socialist system, and there can be the rapid development of the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country, and there can be the bright prospect of gradually transitioning to communism.

The Party's general line for socialist construction was formulated based on Comrade Mao Zedong's initiative. It is the highest summary and embodiment of Mao Zedong Thought on the issue of socialist construction and is the guiding principle for the continuous advancement of our country's socialist cause. Under the brilliant guidance of the general line, our country has achieved the collectivization of the people's communes and the great leap forward in the national economy. By advancing along the road indicated by the general line, we can smoothly carry out socialist construction. Sun Yefang has smeared the general line, which means he has smeared Mao Zedong Thought, smeared the people's communes and the great leap forward, and completely denied the great achievements of our Party in socialist revolution and socialist construction over the past few years, and also denied the correct direction of building socialism.

The Party's general line for socialist construction is a line guided by Mao Zedong Thought, a line that resolutely carries forward the spirit of continuous and thorough revolution advocated by Comrade Mao Zedong, and a line that takes class struggle as the key link to promote the three great revolutionary movements. The soul of the general line is to have Mao Zedong Thought take the lead and to have proletarian politics take the lead. It is precisely because we have been "pursuing" Mao Zedong Thought, this "emptiness," that our socialist construction has had the correct direction, that we have had a series of policies and measures that are in line with reality and correct, and that we have been able to mobilize all the positive factors for building socialism and unleash the revolutionary enthusiasm of hundreds of millions of people. All this has been transformed into an immense material force, enabling our country's socialist construction cause to achieve unprecedented achievements.

Over the past decade, especially since 1958, it is precisely because we have adhered to Mao Zedong Thought taking the lead and adhered to the Party's general line for socialist construction that we have achieved great development in the national economy, quickly overcome the serious difficulties caused by natural disasters and the sabotage of Khrushchev revisionists, rapidly restored industrial and agricultural production, and created a new situation of leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. Enterprises like Daqing and communes like Dazhai have emerged in batches, the atomic bomb has been successfully detonated... Our country is becoming an increasingly powerful fortress of world revolution. Sun Yefang has smeared all this as "emptiness" and "nothingness," which is completely like a mad dog barking at the sun, causing no harm to the great brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's general line for socialist construction, but rather exposing Sun Yefang's ugly face of opposing the Party, opposing socialism, and opposing Mao Zedong Thought.

A Thoroughly Counter-Revolutionary Program to Restore Capitalism

Sun Yefang's counter-revolutionary activities against the Party and socialism are carefully planned and meticulously designed. Over the years, he has proposed a complete program for restoring capitalism. This program concentrates on exposing Sun Yefang's plot to overthrow the socialist system and restore the capitalist system, revealing his political ambition.

Sun Yefang's counter-revolutionary revisionist economic program includes the following reactionary proposals: one is to implement profit as the guiding principle in enterprises and the entire national economy, opposing proletarian politics taking the lead; another is to implement "enterprise autonomy," opposing the centralized and unified leadership of the state, which is fundamentally to transform socialist public ownership into a new type of bureaucratic comprador bourgeois ownership in the style of Yugoslavia; and another is the so-called "new value law theory," which is to make our socialist economy subject to the manipulation of the "value law," denying the role of the law of planned and proportional development of the national economy. These three reactionary proposals boil down to one point: attempting to "peacefully transform" the socialist economy into a capitalist economy.

Opposing proletarian politics taking the lead and advocating profit as the guiding principle is the main means for Sun Yefang to attempt to achieve capitalist restoration through "peaceful transformation." He strongly opposes Comrade Mao Zedong's thought on politics taking the lead, viciously attacking proletarian politics taking the lead as a "subjective idealist viewpoint" and a "lazy thought"; he fervently advocates "profit driving everything" and implementing profit as the guiding principle. He advocates that "profit is the most concentrated expression of the good or bad management of an enterprise," the "most comprehensive indicator," and the "most sensitive sign," and that profit should be used as the "central link to drive everything." He also advocates using the amount of profit to evaluate the good or bad management of an enterprise and proposes that a part of the profit exceeding the plan be given to the enterprise as a bonus to "encourage the enterprise to strive for increased profits." The profit as the guiding principle he advocates is to let bourgeois politics take the lead and to let bourgeois politics dominate everything in our enterprises and the entire national economy.

Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly emphasized: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." "Without correct political views, it is as if there is no soul." Emphasizing politics and implementing Mao Zedong Thought taking the lead is the fundamental principle of socialist revolution and socialist construction. In our socialist enterprises, the fundamental criterion for evaluating the good or bad management of an enterprise is whether it has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized politics, adhered to the line of class struggle and the struggle between the two roads, and achieved the ideological transformation of people. We must turn our socialist enterprises into schools of Mao Zedong Thought. Using Mao Zedong Thought to cultivate and train proletarian revolutionary laborers is the primary task of our socialist enterprises. Only by running enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought can we consolidate and develop the socialist economic foundation of our country, promote the continuous advancement of the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country, and ensure that our country gradually transitions to communism.

Sun Yefang's reason for shouting so loudly against politics taking the lead and raising the black flag of profit as the guiding principle is clear. He wants to uproot our soul and lifeline. He wants to use profit and bonuses as bait and material incentives as means to undermine the revolutionary will of the working class, attempting to turn workers into people who are only concerned with immediate personal interests. What about the historical mission of the working class? What about the great ideal of world revolution and communism? All of these are thrown away. Ideals are nothing, money is everything. In this way, the broad masses will unknowingly become ideological prisoners of the bourgeoisie and revisionism, preparing conditions for Sun Yefang and his ilk to restore capitalism. Similarly, for the entire enterprise, Sun Yefang only wants profit to adjust production, making each enterprise revolve around profit. What about social needs? What about the state plan? What about the political tasks of the Party and the proletariat? All of these can be thrown to the clouds. In this way, socialist planned economy will inevitably be led to capitalist market economy and free competition. Where is there even a trace of socialism left? Sun Yefang once compared profit to a cow's nose and the entire national economy to a cow, saying that as long as you hold onto this cow's nose (profit), the cow (the entire national economy) will follow. This metaphor vividly illustrates the reactionary nature of Sun Yefang's advocacy of profit as the guiding principle. As long as you are led by the nose on the issue of profit, you will follow him to capitalism, making our entire country change color. Look, what a sinister and poisonous trick!

Is it to adhere to proletarian politics taking the lead or to bourgeois profit taking the lead? This is the fundamental dividing line between a socialist enterprise and a capitalist enterprise or a revisionist enterprise. All socialist enterprises must adhere to proletarian politics taking the lead, continuously carry out the struggle to promote the proletariat and eliminate the bourgeoisie, promote the ideological transformation of people, and strive to build a highly proletarianized and combat-ready industrial army, rather than letting the broad laborers become ideological prisoners of capitalism and revisionism, becoming slaves of money and people who only care about immediate personal interests. All production activities of socialist enterprises must serve proletarian politics, meet the needs of revolution and construction, and meet the growing material and cultural needs of the broad masses, rather than blindly pursuing profit and seeking profit at all costs. Otherwise, what is the difference between our enterprises and capitalist enterprises, and enterprises under the rule of modern revisionist groups? Therefore, adhering to proletarian politics taking the lead and opposing profit taking the lead is the fundamental guarantee for enterprises to adhere to the socialist direction and follow the socialist road.

Sun Yefang fiercely opposes the Party and the state's centralized and unified leadership over enterprises and advocates implementing enterprise autonomy. This is a fundamental measure in his counter-revolutionary revisionist economic program. It concentrates on exposing the reactionary nature of this program and concentrates on exposing Sun Yefang's plot to overthrow proletarian dictatorship and the socialist economic foundation. Sun Yefang viciously attacks the Party and the state for "managing socialist enterprises too much and too rigidly," "restricting the hands and feet of enterprises," "limiting the initiative and pioneering spirit of enterprises," and "greatly restricting technological progress and the development of productive forces." What to do? Sun Yefang, under the pretext of "improving the management system," advocates implementing enterprise autonomy, allowing each enterprise to have the power to handle all economic matters within its original capital scope. What power? First, the power to formulate production plans independently and freely expand production. The state only focuses on the "profit" indicator, and the production plan is formulated by the enterprise according to market needs. Second, the power to freely dispose of the enterprise's depreciation fund and "freely buy and sell fixed assets," allowing enterprises to arbitrarily expand or reduce their production capacity and independently decide the direction of technological transformation. Third, the abolition of the state's material plan allocation system, allowing enterprises to arrange supply and marketing relations through "contracts." Products are freely bought and sold, freely competed, and the state does not need to "interfere." Sun Yefang calls the power given to enterprises "small power," then what "big power" does the state have left? What can the state still manage? In short, it is only to collect profits and distribute investments.

The plot is revealed! Everyone can see clearly: the power that Sun Yefang advocates delegating to enterprises is not some "small power," but the big power that the proletarian dictatorship state should hold. What he opposes is not "managing too much," but fundamentally abolishing the unified planning of the socialist economy and the leadership of the Party. Like Deng Tuo and his ilk, he wants to uproot the core of our great cause—the leadership of the great Comrade Mao Zedong and the Party, and wants our Party to step down, allowing this small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists to engage in politics, military affairs, economics, and culture, allowing them to seize our power, and allowing the entire set of capitalist economic foundations and superstructures to occupy the "dominant position" in our country.

Comrade Mao Zedong emphasized: Without a high degree of democracy, it is impossible to have a high degree of concentration, and without a high degree of concentration, it is impossible to build a socialist economy. Comrade Mao Zedong has always advocated that the socialist public ownership economy must implement the principle of democratic centralism, that is, the principle of "concentrated leadership and graded management." All economic activities of the public ownership economy must be carried out under the highly concentrated and unified leadership of the Party and the state. The concentrated and unified leadership of the Party and the state is first of all to ensure the absolute leadership of the Party over enterprises in politics and ideology under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to ensure that all economic activities of enterprises are carried out under unified understanding, unified policy, unified plan, unified command, and unified action; at the same time, under the condition of ensuring the concentrated and unified leadership of the Party and the state, to give enterprises a certain degree of flexibility, so that enterprises can exert their initiative and creativity. This is the lively and dynamic relationship within the socialist economy. If we follow Sun Yefang's reactionary plan, handing over the power to decide the direction of the entire social production development and formulate the state plan to enterprises, and dividing the ownership of the means of production of socialist enterprises into the "independent sovereignty" of individual enterprises, where can we still talk about the concentrated and unified leadership of the Party and the state, and where can we still talk about the public ownership nature of socialist enterprises!

Sun Yefang's set of proposals is nothing but the unadulterated "worker self-management" of Yugoslavia. This is the most audacious counter-revolutionary restoration plan to restore capitalist relations from production to circulation. After the October Revolution, Lenin once severely criticized this so-called "self-management" reactionary proposal, pointing out in a penetrating manner: "Any direct or indirect legalization of the ownership of individual factories or individual industries by workers over their respective production, or the legalization of their weakening or hindering the execution of the orders of the national power, is a great distortion and complete abandonment of the basic principles of the Soviet power and socialism." Now, the traitors of Leninism—the Soviet modern revisionist group, are not carrying out the evil deed of fully restoring capitalism under the name of "expanding the authority of enterprise managers"? Sun Yefang is promoting the same revisionist goods. Sun Yefang wants to implement precisely this road to restore capitalism!

While advocating his "profit as the guiding principle" and "enterprise autonomy," Sun Yefang also fervently promotes his so-called "new value law theory" and uses it as the "theoretical basis" for his entire counter-revolutionary revisionist economic program. Sun Yefang has always regarded the value law as sacred, extolling the magical effect of the value law. He advocates using the value law to replace the law of planned and proportional development of the national economy, using the value law as the regulator of socialist production. He says: "Thousands of laws, tens of thousands of laws, the value law is the first." "The value law is actually the law of 'catching up with the advanced and the advanced becoming even more advanced' that continuously promotes the development of productive forces and drives society forward." These words are said to be divine. In fact, this is Sun Yefang's bewildering array, a play at mystification. Sun Yefang is afraid that his reactionary program will be exposed, so he specially gives it a cumbersome academic cloak. The value law he talks about is nothing but profit dominating everything, material incentives, and money being everything.

The regulatory role of the value law in social production is based on a market economy, not a planned economy. The regulatory role of the value law in social production is actually the regulatory role of profit in production. Sun Yefang extols the value law as the "first" law that transcends everything, which, in essence, is to fundamentally deny the necessity of the Party and the state's centralized and unified leadership and unified planning of the socialist economy, providing a "theoretical basis" for his "profit as the guiding principle" and "enterprise autonomy." We do not deny the necessity of utilizing the value law to a certain extent and within a certain scope under the socialist system, but we must not allow it to spread freely and dominate everything. Otherwise, it will abolish the socialist planned economy and make the socialist economy degenerate into capitalism. Sun Yefang claims that the value law can "continuously promote the development of productive forces" and "continuously drive society forward." In essence, it is to lull the revolutionary people's class vigilance, abandon the struggle against capitalism, and let Sun Yefang and various ghosts and demons collude with each other to restore capitalism. This is completely their one-sided counter-revolutionary delusion!

The above is a thoroughly counter-revolutionary revisionist economic program proposed by Sun Yefang. This is a blueprint for restoring capitalism meticulously designed by Sun Yefang.

According to this blueprint, our socialist country becomes the big boss of capitalism, giving enterprises a sum of money and letting them make money, with the state taking interest on the principal. Enterprises become "joint ventures" between the state and the factory director or manager, with both sides dividing the profits. Under such circumstances, the leading cadres of the state and enterprises will also degenerate into a privileged stratum. If we develop in this way, will our country not change color?

According to this blueprint, the leadership of the Party is gone, the economic foundation of the proletarian dictatorship is gone, the unified national economic plan of the state is gone, and the direction of socialism and communism is gone. In this way, what is the difference between our country and capitalist countries, and countries ruled by modern revisionist groups?

According to this blueprint, everyone "strives to increase profits," everyone produces high-priced and high-profit products, chasing the highest profits, and will society not reappear with free competition and production anarchy? Profit does not fall from the sky; ultimately, it is created by the working class and the broad masses of laborers with their own hands. If the minds of enterprise leaders are only filled with bonuses and profits, in order to get more bonuses and more profits, they will use their authority to ruthlessly exploit and oppress the working masses, and the working masses will once again become the exploited and oppressed. In today's modern revisionist-ruled Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, are not such things happening?

This is the essence of Sun Yefang's counter-revolutionary revisionist economic program.

What is revisionism? What is peaceful evolution? The "Three Family Village" clique has provided us with a specimen, and Sun Yefang has provided us with another specimen! Today, the struggle between us and a small group of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements is not a mere academic debate, but a struggle between Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and modern revisionism, a struggle between the socialist road and the capitalist road, and a heart-pounding struggle between peaceful evolution and anti-peaceful evolution. Comrades, take a look at the blueprint for restoring capitalism designed by Sun Yefang, and you can clearly see the nature of this struggle.

A Loyal Dog of Modern Revisionism, a Slave and Traitor to the Nation

The set of things that Sun Yefang has been boasting about is not some "new invention," but completely smuggled from Khrushchev revisionism.

Sun Yefang's entire set of revisionist proposals is a reflection of the revisionist trend in the international communist movement after the 20th Congress of the CPSU in the field of economics in our country. In 1956, Sun Yefang met some revisionist advisors of Khrushchev during his visit to the Soviet Union and was immediately infatuated. After returning to the country, he repeatedly praised modern revisionists as his teachers, saying that he had obtained "many profound explanations" and "the greatest enlightenment" from them. He shamelessly said that his set of views were all picked up from the "teeth" of Soviet revisionists. After 1959, he went to the Soviet Union twice to learn the "experience" of restoring capitalism. After returning to the country, he even wrote a report, arrogantly demanding that our Party and state take the "overcoming dogmatism in the Soviet economic field," that is, the practice of promoting revisionism, as a "reference." After the 22nd Congress of the CPSU, the infamous Liberman, under the instructions of Khrushchev, proposed to replace planned management with profit regulation, and Sun Yefang openly claimed that his views were "more thorough than Liberman's." Look, this vanguard of the anti-Party and anti-socialist elements in the field of economics, originally just a loyal dog of modern revisionism, is a thorough traitor to the nation. He has completely bowed down to the feet of modern revisionists, showing that servile and slavish appearance. Comrade Mao Zedong has long pointed out: These people who stubbornly want to take the capitalist road "are actually preparing to surrender to imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism." The Soviet modern revisionists have long become slaves and dogs of American imperialism, while Sun Yefang is a "slave of a slave," a dog of a dog!

Over the years, Sun Yefang's program for restoring capitalism has been repeatedly refuted and resisted by the broad masses of economic theorists and economic workers, but he has always stubbornly resisted and remained obstinate, even shouting to "fight bare-chested." For such a die-hard counter-revolutionary revisionist, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals must rise up and attack him, and drum to defeat him. We must expose Sun Yefang's paper tiger, peel off his disguise, pull down the black flag in the field of economics, and firmly plant the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in the field of economics!

　　粉碎孙冶方复辟资本主义的反革命纲领
　　耿东
    孙冶方是反党反社会主义的修正主义分子，是反动的资产阶级经济学“权威”。他长期盘踞在中国科学院经济研究所领导岗位上，大量散布从苏联现代修正主义那里贩来的黑货，疯狂地进行反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的勾当。从一九五六年苏共二十大起，他就当上了赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义的应声虫。他声嘶力竭地反对毛泽东思想，反对党的社会主义建设总路线，主张利润挂帅和企业独立自治，提出了一整套反革命的修正主义经济纲领。他的目的就是妄图瓦解我们的社会主义所有制，使社会主义经济蜕化变质，把我国拉上资本主义复辟的道路，恢复资产阶级专政。我们必须彻底批判孙冶方的反革命的修正主义经济纲领，捍卫毛泽东思想，捍卫我国的社会主义制度，粉碎资本主义的反革命复辟阴谋。
    妄图推翻毛泽东思想的领导地位，恶毒地攻击党的社会主义建设总路线
    伟大的毛泽东思想，是一切反党反社会主义分子阴谋搞反革命复辟活动的最大障碍。一切反党反社会主义分子总是把攻击的矛头首先指向毛泽东思想。“三家村”黑帮是这样，以周扬为首的文艺黑线是这样，孙冶方这个反革命老手也是这样。孙冶方对毛泽东思想怀着刻骨的阶级仇恨，极为恶毒地把毛泽东思想污蔑为“传统教条主义”和“自然经济论”。胡说什么：“传统教条主义”和“自然经济论”在我国“处于不言而喻的独占地位”，“根深蒂固地影响着当前的理论和实践”，造成一系列严重“问题”和“恶果”，把整个社会主义制度“窒息了”。胡说什么：毛泽东思想“务的全是‘虚’”，“归结为‘鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义’的总路线的时候，就更‘虚’了，干劲的劲完全是精神的东西了”。他公然否定毛泽东思想的领导地位，大叫大嚷要在经济领域中取消毛泽东思想挂帅，取消党的社会主义建设总路线，其根本目的，就是要实行他的一套反革命的修正主义经济纲领，把我国的社会主义经济全面引上资本主义复辟的道路。
    在我国社会主义建设事业中，是不是坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，是不是坚持贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线，这是关系到我国走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路的头等大事，是关系到我们国家的命运和前途的根本问题。
    毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃、社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义，是我们进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的指南，是战胜帝国主义、现代修正主义的强大思想武器。毛泽东思想在我国的确是“处于不言而喻的独占地位”的。毛泽东思想的这种独占地位，正是我国七亿人民所绝对需要和极力维护的。毛泽东思想引导我们社会主义革命和社会主义建设取得一个又一个胜利，毛泽东思想是一切阶级敌人所最惧怕、最恼恨的。在我们的社会中，仍然存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争。在无产阶级和资产阶级、社会主义道路和资本主义道路的斗争中，不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风；不是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想独占，就是资本主义、修正主义思想独占；不是无产阶级独占，就是资产阶级独占。其他道路是没有的。毛泽东思想是我们一切工作的指导方针，是我们一切革命事业取得胜利的根本保证，是我们心中的红太阳，是我们的命根子，是我们一切力量的源泉。有了伟大的毛泽东思想的独占地位，才有社会主义制度的独占地位，才能有我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的飞快发展，才能有胜利过渡到共产主义的远大前途。
    我们党的社会主义建设总路线是根据毛泽东同志的倡议制订的，是毛泽东思想在社会主义建设问题上的最高概括和体现，是引导我国社会主义事业不断前进的指针。在总路线的光辉照耀下，我国实现了人民公社化，出现了国民经济的大跃进。沿着总路线指明的道路前进，我们就可以顺利地进行社会主义建设。孙冶方抹黑了总路线，就抹黑了毛泽东思想，抹黑了人民公社和大跃进，就全盘否定了我们党这几年进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大成就，也就否定了建设社会主义的正确方向。
    党的社会主义建设总路线，是以毛泽东思想为指导的路线，是坚决发扬毛泽东同志历来提倡的无产阶级不断革命、彻底革命精神的路线，是以阶级斗争为纲，促进三大革命运动的路线。总路线的灵魂，就是以毛泽东思想挂帅，以无产阶级政治挂帅。我们正是“务”了毛泽东思想这个“虚”，我们的社会主义建设才有了正确的方向，我们才有了一系列切合实际的、正确的方针、政策，才能调动一切建设社会主义的积极因素，发挥千百万人民群众的革命干劲。这一切，化成无比巨大的物质力量，使我国的社会主义建设事业取得了史无前例的成就。
    建国十多年来，特别是一九五八年以来，我们正是由于坚持了毛泽东思想挂帅，坚持了党的社会主义建设总路线，才取得了国民经济的大发展，迅速克服了严重的自然灾害和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的破坏所造成的困难，工农业生产迅速恢复了，新的工农业生产跃进的局面出现了，大庆式企业和大寨式社队成批地出现了，原子弹爆炸成功了……，我们的国家正愈来愈成为世界革命的强大堡垒。孙冶方把这一切污蔑为“空虚”和“虚无”，这完全是狂犬吠日，丝毫无损于毛泽东思想和党的社会主义建设总路线的伟大光辉，相反，更加暴露出孙冶方反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的丑恶嘴脸。
    一个彻头彻尾复辟资本主义的反革命纲领
    孙冶方反党反社会主义的反革命活动，是经过周密策划、精心设计的。这些年来，他提出了一整套复辟资本主义的经济纲领。这个纲领，集中暴露了孙冶方之流阴谋推翻社会主义制度、恢复资本主义制度的政治野心。
    孙冶方提出的反革命的修正主义经济纲领包括这样几项反动主张：一条是在企业和整个国民经济中实行利润挂帅，反对无产阶级政治挂帅；一条是实行“企业独立自治”，反对国家的集中统一领导，也就是从根本上变社会主义的全民所有制为南斯拉夫式的新型的官僚买办资产阶级所有制；一条是所谓“新价值规律论”，也就是要我们社会主义经济听从“价值规律”的摆布，否定国民经济有计划按比例发展规律的作用。这三条反动主张集中到一点，就是妄图把社会主义经济“和平演变”为资本主义经济。
    反对无产阶级政治挂帅，主张利润挂帅，是孙冶方妄图通过“和平演变”实现资本主义复辟的主要手段。他强烈反对毛泽东同志关于政治挂帅的思想，恶毒地攻击无产阶级政治挂帅是“唯心论观点”，是“懒汉思想”；狂热地主张以“利润带动一切”，实行利润挂帅。他鼓吹“利润是企业经营好坏的最集中的表现”、“最综合的指标”和“最灵敏的标志”，要把利润作为“带动一切的中心环节”。他还主张以利润的多少来评价企业经营管理的好坏，并且提出把超计划利润的一部分“分给企业作为奖金”，以“鼓励企业为增加盈利而奋斗”。他所主张的这种利润挂帅，也就是要让资产阶级政治挂帅，要让资产阶级政治在我们的企业和全部国民经济中主宰一切。
    毛主席曾经反复强调指出：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”突出政治，实行毛泽东思想挂帅，是社会主义革命和社会主义建设的根本。在我们的社会主义企业里，衡量经营好坏的根本标准，是看它是否高举了毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，坚持以阶级斗争、两条道路斗争为纲，实现人的思想革命化。我们必须把社会主义企业，办成一座座毛泽东思想的大学校。用毛泽东思想培养和造就无产阶级的革命化的劳动者，是我们社会主义企业的首要任务。只有按照毛泽东思想办企业，才能巩固和发展我国的社会主义经济基础，推动我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的不断前进，才能保证我国逐步地向共产主义过渡。
    孙冶方所以要这样声嘶力竭地反对政治挂帅，打起利润挂帅的黑旗，其用心是昭然若揭的。他是要挖掉我们的灵魂和生命线。他是要以利润、奖金为钓饵，以物质刺激为手段，瓦解工人阶级的革命意志，妄图把工人都变成斤斤计较眼前私利的人。什么工人阶级的历史使命，什么世界革命和共产主义的伟大理想，都一古脑儿把它抛弃掉。理想算不得什么，钞票就是一切。这样，广大群众就会不知不觉地变成资产阶级和修正主义的思想俘虏，为孙冶方之流复辟资本主义准备条件。同样，就整个企业来说，孙冶方也无非是要让利润来调节企业的生产，使每个企业都绕着利润团团转，什么社会需要啦，国家计划啦，党和无产阶级的政治任务啦，等等，全都可以抛到九霄云外。这样，就必然会把社会主义计划经济，导向资本主义的市场经济，导向自由竞争。这哪里还有一丝一毫社会主义的影子呢？孙冶方曾经把利润比做牛鼻子，把整个国民经济比做牛，说只要牵住这个牛鼻子（利润），牛（整个国民经济）就会跟着跑了。这个譬喻十分形象地说明了孙冶方宣扬利润挂帅的反动本质。只要你在利润问题上被他牵住了鼻子，那你就得跟着他跑向资本主义，使我们整个国家变颜色。请看，这是多么阴险毒辣的诡计呀！
    是坚持无产阶级政治挂帅，还是资产阶级利润挂帅，这是社会主义企业还是资本主义企业或修正主义企业的根本分界线。一切社会主义企业，必须坚持无产阶级政治挂帅，不断开展兴无灭资的斗争，促进人的思想革命化，努力建立起一支非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的产业大军，而不是让广大劳动者成为资本主义和修正主义的思想俘虏，成为金钱奴隶和只顾眼前私利的人。一切社会主义企业的生产活动，必须为无产阶级政治服务，为满足革命和建设的需要服务，为满足广大人民日益增长的物质和文化的需要服务，而不是盲目地追求利润，唯利是图。否则，我们的企业和资本主义的企业，和现代修正主义集团统治下的企业，还有什么两样呢？因此，坚持无产阶级政治挂帅，反对利润挂帅，是企业坚持社会主义方向，走社会主义道路的根本保证。
    孙冶方疯狂地反对党和国家对企业的集中统一领导，主张实行企业独立自治。这是他的反革命的修正主义经济纲领中的一项根本性措施。它集中暴露了这个纲领的反动实质，集中暴露了孙冶方阴谋颠覆无产阶级专政和社会主义经济基础的野心。孙冶方恶毒地攻击党和国家对社会主义企业“管得过多，管得过死”，“束缚了企业的手脚”，“限制了企业的积极性和首创精神”，“大大限制了技术进步和生产力的发展”。怎么办？孙冶方以“改进管理体制”为幌子，主张实行企业独立自治，使每个企业在原有资金范围内，“有独立处理一切经济事务的职权”。什么职权呢？一是有权自行制订生产计划，自由扩大生产。国家只抓“利润”指标，生产计划由企业根据市场需要自己制定。二是有权自由支配企业的折旧基金和“自由买卖固定资产”，允许企业任意扩大或缩小自己的生产能力，自行决定技术改造的方向。三是取消国家的物资计划调拨制度，由企业通过“合同制”自行安排供销关系。产品自由买卖，自由竞争，国家也不必“过问”。孙冶方把给企业的这些权，称为“小权”，那末，国家剩下来有些什么“大权”呢？国家还能管些什么呢？说穿了，就只是收取利润和分配投资而已。
    图穷匕首见！大家可以看得很清楚：孙冶方主张下放给企业的，根本不是什么“小权”，而是无产阶级专政的国家应该掌握的大权。他所反对的，根本不是什么“管得过多”，而是根本取消社会主义经济的统一计划，取消党的领导。孙冶方同邓拓之流一样，是要挖掉我们伟大事业的核心——以伟大的毛泽东同志为首的党的领导，要我们党下台，让他们这一小撮反革命的修正主义分子去搞政治，搞军事，搞经济，搞文化，让他们来专我们的政，让资本主义的整套经济基础和上层建筑在我国取得“独占地位”。
    毛泽东同志强调指出：没有高度的民主，不可能有高度的集中，而没有高度的集中，就不可能建立社会主义经济。毛泽东同志一贯主张，社会主义全民所有制经济必须实行民主集中制原则，也就是实行“集中领导、分级管理”的原则。全民所有制经济的全部经济活动，都必须在党和国家的高度集中统一领导下进行。党和国家的集中统一领导，首先就是在毛泽东思想的旗帜下，保证党对企业在政治、思想上的绝对领导，保证企业的全部经济活动在统一认识、统一政策、统一计划、统一指挥、统一行动下进行；同时，在保证党和国家集中统一领导的条件下，给予企业一定的机动权，使企业能够发挥主动性和创造性。这就是社会主义经济内部的生动活泼的关系。如果按照孙冶方的反动方案，把决定整个社会生产发展方向的、制订国家计划的大权都交给企业，把社会主义企业的生产资料所有权都分割成单个企业的“独立主权”，哪里还谈得上什么党和国家的集中统一领导，还谈得上什么社会主义企业的全民所有制性质呢！
    孙冶方的这一套主张，不是别的，正是不折不扣的南斯拉夫的“企业工人自治”。这是从生产到流通全面恢复资本主义关系的最狂妄的反革命复辟计划。十月革命以后，列宁曾经痛斥过这种所谓“自治”的反动主张，他一针见血地指出：“任何直接或间接地把个别工厂或个别行业的工人对他们各自的生产的所有权合法化、或者把他们削弱或阻挠执行全国政权的命令的权利合法化的做法，都是对苏维埃政权基本原则的极大歪曲和完全放弃社会主义。”现在，列宁主义的叛徒——苏联现代修正主义集团，不是正在所谓“扩大企业经理的权限”的名义下，干着全面复辟资本主义的罪恶勾当吗？孙冶方所推销的，也正是这种修正主义的货色。孙冶方要实行的，正是这条复辟资本主义的道路！
    孙冶方在鼓吹他的“利润挂帅论”和“企业独立自治论”的同时，还狂热地宣扬他的所谓“新价值规律论”，并以此作为他整个反革命的修正主义经济纲领的“理论基础”。孙冶方一贯把价值规律奉若神明，大肆鼓吹价值规律的神奇作用。他主张用价值规律来代替国民经济有计划按比例发展规律，以价值规律作为社会主义生产的调节者。他说：“千规律，万规律，价值规律第一条。”“价值规律，实际上就是不断促进生产力发展，推动社会前进的‘落后赶先进，先进再先进’的规律。”这些话说得神乎其神。其实，这是孙冶方摆的迷魂阵，是在故弄玄虚。孙冶方怕他提出的这套反动纲领露了馅，特地为它披上一件烦琐的学术外衣。他所说的价值规律，就是利润主宰一切，就是物质刺激，就是金钱万能，如此而已。
    价值规律对社会生产的调节作用，是以市场经济为前提，而不是以计划经济为前提的。价值规律对社会生产的调节作用，实际上也就是利润对生产的调节作用。孙冶方把价值规律吹捧为凌驾一切的“第一条”规律，说穿了，就是要从根本上否定党和国家对社会主义经济实行集中统一领导和统一计划的必要性，为他的“利润挂帅论”和“企业独立自治论”提供“理论根据”。我们并不否认在社会主义制度下，在一定范围内和一定程度上利用价值规律的必要性，但是，决不能任其自由泛滥，统治一切。否则，就会取消社会主义计划经济，使社会主义经济向资本主义蜕化。孙冶方胡说什么价值规律可以“不断促进生产力发展”，不断“推动社会前进”。说穿了，就是要麻痹革命人民的阶级警惕，放弃对资本主义的斗争，好让孙冶方和各种牛鬼蛇神互相勾结起来，放手去复辟资本主义。这完全是他们一厢情愿的反革命妄想！
    以上就是孙冶方提出来的一个彻头彻尾的反革命的修正主义经济纲领。这就是孙冶方精心设计的一幅复辟资本主义的蓝图。
    按照这个蓝图，我们社会主义国家就成为资本主义的大老板，包给企业一笔钱，放手让企业赚钱，国家按本取利。企业就成了国家和厂长、经理合伙开设的“合营公司”，双方来瓜分利润。在这种情况下，国家和企业的领导干部也就会蜕化为特权阶层。这样发展下去，我们的国家岂不跟着变颜色了吗？
      按照这个蓝图，党的领导没有了，无产阶级专政的经济基础没有了，国家的统一国民经济计划没有了，社会主义和共产主义的方向也没有了。这样，我们的国家，与资本主义国家，与现代修正主义集团统治的国家，又有什么区别呢？
    按照这个蓝图，大家都“为增加盈利而奋斗”，大家都去生产价高利大的产品，追逐最高的利润，社会上不是又会重新出现自由竞争和生产无政府状态吗？利润不是从天上掉下来的，归根到底是要靠工人阶级和广大劳动人民用双手去创造的。如果企业领导人的心目中只有奖金和利润，为了多得奖金，多得利润，他们就会利用自己的职权，无情地剥削和压榨工人群众，工人群众又将重新沦为被剥削者和被压迫者。在今天的现代修正主义统治下的苏联和南斯拉夫，不正是发生着这样的事情吗！
    这就是孙冶方的反革命的修正主义经济纲领的本质。
    什么是修正主义？什么是和平演变？“三家村”黑帮为我们提供了一个标本，孙冶方为我们提供了又一个标本！今天我们和一小撮反党反社会主义分子之间的斗争，决不是什么学术上的论争，而是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想与现代修正主义的斗争，是社会主义道路与资本主义道路的斗争，是和平演变与反和平演变的惊心动魄的斗争。请同志们看一看孙冶方设计的这一复辟资本主义的蓝图，就可以清楚地看出这场斗争的性质。
    现代修正主义的忠实走狗，奴颜婢膝的民族败类
    孙冶方大吹大擂的这套东西，并不是什么“新发明”，而完全是从赫鲁晓夫修正主义那里贩运来的。
    孙冶方的一整套修正主义主张，是苏共二十大以后，国际共产主义运动中的修正主义逆流在我国经济学界的一种反映。一九五六年，孙冶方在访苏期间结识了赫鲁晓夫的一些修正主义谋士，一见之下，就崇拜得五体投地。回国后，他一再称颂现代修正主义者是他的老师，说他从他们那里得到了“许多精湛的说明”和“最大的启示”。他恬不知耻地说，他的一套观点都是拾自苏联修正主义者的“牙慧”。一九五九年以后，他又两次去苏联取复辟资本主义之“经”。回国后，他还竟然写报告，狂妄地要我们党和国家把“苏联经济学界克服教条主义”，即推行修正主义的做法，“引为借鉴”。苏共二十二大后，臭名远扬的利别尔曼在赫鲁晓夫指使下，提出以利润调节来代替计划管理的建议，孙冶方公然声称，他的观点“比利别尔曼还彻底”。请看，这个盘踞在经济学界的反党反社会主义的急先锋，原来不过是一条现代修正主义的忠实走狗，是一个地地道道的民族败类。他完全拜倒在现代修正主义者的脚下，表现出那副卑躬屈节、奴颜婢膝的奴才相。毛泽东同志早就指出过：这些顽固地要走资本主义路线的人，“实际上是准备投降帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的人”。苏联现代修正主义者早已成为美帝国主义的奴才和走狗，而孙冶方却是个“奴下奴”，走狗的走狗！
    几年来，孙冶方的一套复辟资本主义的经济纲领，曾经受到广大经济理论工作者和经济工作者的一再驳斥和抵制，但他却始终顽强抵抗，执迷不悟，甚至叫嚣要“赤膊上阵”。对这样一个死心塌地的反革命修正主义分子，广大工农兵群众、革命干部和革命知识分子一定要群起而攻之，擂鼓以伐之。我们一定要戳穿孙冶方这只纸老虎，剥去他的画皮，拔掉在经济学界的这面黑旗，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗牢牢地插到经济学领域中去！
