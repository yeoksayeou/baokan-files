During the few years Zhou Yang served as the Party Secretary of the Ministry of Culture, he ordered the cancellation of all institutions and units that directly served the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and engaged in cultural popularization and mass cultural work.

1. He canceled the revolutionary tradition-laden cultural and art troupes and transformed them into large theaters to focus on stage art.

2. He canceled the Science Popularization Bureau, effectively halting the dissemination of scientific knowledge to the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

3. He canceled the China Lantern Slide Company. Lantern slides were a convenient and powerful tool for serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

4. He canceled the Central Folk Art Museum, which was an institution guiding the cultural activities of workers and peasants.

5. He canceled the Popular Readings Publishing House.

6. He canceled the Mass Culture Bureau. Due to opposition from some provincial and municipal cultural bureau leaders and staff of the Mass Culture Bureau, it was not immediately canceled, but it was effectively defunct. In 1964, during Zhou Yang's fake rectification campaign at the Ministry of Culture, it was formally canceled.

See, this anti-party black gang leader Zhou Yang, madly canceled so many mass cultural institutions. Isn't this open evidence of his opposition to Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line?

　　周扬的“取消”政策
    周扬当文化部党组书记的几年中，凡是直接为工农兵服务的、搞文化普及和群众文化工作的机构和单位，都被他下令取消了。
    一、取消有革命传统的文工团，改为大型剧院，搞剧场艺术。
    二、取消科学普及局。这是取消对工农兵群众的科学知识的普及工作。
    三、取消中国幻灯公司。幻灯是为工农兵服务最简便有力的工具。
    四、取消中央群众艺术馆。这是个辅导工农群众业余文化活动的机构。
    五、取消通俗读物出版社。
    六、取消群众文化局。由于一些省市文化局负责人和群众文化局干部反对，没有立即取消，但名存实亡。一九六四年周扬到文化部搞假整风时，正式取消。
    请看，周扬这个反党黑帮头目，疯狂地取消了那么多的群众文化机构，这不是公开地反对毛主席文艺路线的罪证吗？
