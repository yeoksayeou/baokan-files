When we arrived in Daqing, our first task was to build "dry mud walls" with our own hands. Following Chairman Mao's instructions, we came here with the revolutionary resolve to smash the capitalist and revisionist education system and the spirit to establish a school in the style of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University. Therefore, our enthusiasm grew stronger and stronger. The mud bricks that were originally planned to be completed in three months were finished in just over fifty days.

After the school buildings were completed, we started classes while also engaging in labor. The teachers and students were influenced by the revolutionary thoughts of the worker comrades, and their ideological and academic progress was rapid. Student Shang Jun once delivered materials to the well team. On the way, he suddenly encountered a strong wind. He took off his cotton jacket to wrap the materials, walking over thirty miles in his single layer of clothing. When asked if he was cold, he said, "The worker comrades, in order to quickly retrieve the rock core, have injured their hands, but they still work meticulously. What is this compared to that!"

Now, the students happily say: Through half-work and half-study, we can say that we have learned "mathematics, physics, and chemistry" and can go anywhere in the world without fear. However, what we mean is completely different from what the bourgeoisie say. Our "mathematics" refers to having in our hearts the great number of 700 million people in China and 3 billion people in the world; our "physics" refers to the truth of Mao Zedong Thought; our "chemistry" refers to the revolutionization of ideology.

Since we came to Daqing, we have repeatedly assessed the students' performance, which is not lower than that of full-time education but higher. Previously, we only studied without labor, and what we learned could not be applied to actual work. Now, not only do we understand the books, but we can also operate in practice.

We have been practicing half-work and half-study for only one year. We must follow Chairman Mao's great instructions to thoroughly break the old educational framework, criticize bourgeois education thoughts, and thoroughly change. Halfway measures are not enough; we must thoroughly break and thoroughly change.

    大庆石油地质学校教师　杨作桐：
    办抗大式革命学校
    我们来到大庆，第一课就是自己动手盖“干打垒”。我们是按照毛主席的教导，带着砸碎资本主义、修正主义教育制度的革命决心，办抗大式学校的志气，来勤俭建校的，所以干劲越来越足，原来计划三个月打完的土坯，只用了五十多天就完成了。
    校舍建成以后，我们一面上课，一面做工，师生们受到工人师傅革命思想的熏陶，思想和学业进步很快。学生商俊，有一次往井队送资料，半路上突然遇到大风，他怕资料刮坏，脱下棉衣把资料包住，穿着单衣走了三十多里路。别人问他冷不冷，他说：“工人师傅为抢着接岩芯，手都碰坏了，仍然一丝不苟，我这算什么！”
    现在，同学们高兴地说：我们通过半工半读，也可以说是，学了“数理化”，走遍天下都不怕。不过我们和资产阶级说的完全是两回事。我们说的“数”，是指胸中有全国七亿人民和全世界三十亿人民的大数；我们说的“理”，是毛泽东思想的真理；我们说的“化”，是思想革命化。
    我们来到大庆以后，多次考核过，学生成绩不是比全日制低了，而是高了。以前光念书，不劳动，学的东西到实际工作中用不上。现在不仅在书本上懂了，还会实际操作。
    我们搞半工半读只有一年，还得按毛主席的伟大指示，大破旧的教育框框，批判资产阶级教育思想，破半截是不行的，必须彻底地破，彻底地改。
