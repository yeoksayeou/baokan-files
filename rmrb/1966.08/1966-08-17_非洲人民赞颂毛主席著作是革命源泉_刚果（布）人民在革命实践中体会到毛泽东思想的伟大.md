African people love Chairman Mao Zedong and praise his great works as the source of revolution, pointing out that China has become the center of Marxism-Leninism revolution.

Members of the 15th branch of the "National Revolutionary Movement" of Congo (Brazzaville) have, over the past two years, participated in parades holding up "Long Live Mao Zedong" banners on their national day and youth day. The chairman of this branch recently told a Xinhua News Agency reporter that Chairman Mao is a great revolutionary model and a shining example they should learn from. He said: Because of Mao Zedong Thought, China has become the center of Marxism-Leninism revolution. They believe that Mao Zedong Thought will also guide them to achieve thorough liberation, progress, and dignity.

Chairman Mao's works have become the spiritual food of the African people and inspire them to engage in revolutionary struggles. In Mali, a manager of a bookstore recently told a Xinhua News Agency reporter: The people of Mali enthusiastically welcome Chairman Mao's works because his works are the source of revolution, covering all aspects of revolutionary issues, and every sentence has profound meaning.

A freedom fighter from Azania (South Africa) was overjoyed upon receiving a copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." He pressed the book to his chest and excitedly told a Xinhua News Agency reporter, "This book is more precious to me than anything else. When I carry this volume of 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' with me, I am filled with confidence to fight for my country until victory."

According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Brazzaville dated August 14, since the August Revolution three years ago, the people of Congo (Brazzaville) have, in the process of repeatedly foiling the subversive plots of imperialism and reactionaries, increasingly felt the great guiding significance of Mao Zedong Thought. The weekly "Independence" of Congo (Brazzaville) recently published an article titled "No Longer Fearful of Ghosts" by its editor-in-chief Ndala, which said that the recent defeat of the counter-revolutionary coup d'état by imperialism in Congo (Brazzaville) "proves that Mao Zedong's thought that imperialism and reactionaries, no matter how they cause trouble, are doomed to failure is correct." The article pointed out: Once the people are armed, they can "resist and defeat all demons."

The article said, "It is necessary to arm the people ideologically ... and emphasize politics everywhere." "The more intense the class struggle, the higher the class consciousness of the poor. The more the imperialists, colonialists, and their Congolese lackeys cause trouble, the more they are bound to fail. But they will not stop, we ... cannot stop on the road to victory, cannot stop chasing the fleeing enemy."

After the defeat of a coup d'état launched by imperialism and reactionaries on June 27, the youth of Congo (Brazzaville) have further mobilized to undergo military and political training. A responsible person from a branch of the youth organization of the National Revolutionary Movement of Congo (Brazzaville) told a Xinhua News Agency reporter that Chairman Mao's article "Carry the Revolution Through to the End" greatly inspired him. He quoted to the reporter a Greek fable from the article: A farmer, out of pity for a snake, was eventually bitten to death by the snake. He said: "We must never harbor snakes, we must not harbor any illusions about imperialism."

A high-ranking official of Congo (Brazzaville) called on Congolese youth at a meeting to arm themselves with rifles. He said: "Now that imperialism is sharpening its knives, we must also sharpen our knives. The rights won by the people must not be easily relinquished, and we must fight to defend these rights." At the meeting, he quoted Chairman Mao's words: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they are not so powerful. From a long-term point of view, it is not the reactionaries but the people who are really powerful."

Recently, the people's court of Congo (Brazzaville) reopened, sentencing to death the former deputy chief of staff of the national army, Muzabakani, who conspired to overthrow the government of Congo (Brazzaville) in 1964, and others; and sentenced to imprisonment Donatien, who was bought by the United States and continuously sent intelligence to the U.S. embassy in Congo (Brazzaville) from 1962 to 1965. A judge of the people's court told the reporter: "Dictatorship must be enforced against counter-revolutionaries." He quoted Chairman Mao's words: "They can only be allowed to behave themselves and not to cause trouble."

The people of Congo (Brazzaville) love Chairman Mao's works. In the process of foiling the subversive plots of imperialism and reactionaries, they increasingly feel the great guiding significance of Mao Zedong Thought.

　　非洲人民赞颂毛主席著作是革命源泉
　　刚果（布）人民在革命实践中体会到毛泽东思想的伟大
    据新华社十六日讯　非洲人民热爱毛泽东主席，称颂毛主席的伟大著作是革命源泉，指出中国已成为马克思列宁主义革命中心。
    刚果（布）“全国革命运动”第十五支部的成员们，近两年来，每逢他们的国庆节和青年节，都高举着“毛泽东万岁”的标语牌参加游行。这个支部的主席最近对新华社记者说，毛主席是他们应该学习的伟大的革命典范和光辉的榜样。他说：由于有毛泽东思想，中国已经成为马克思列宁主义的革命中心。他们相信，毛泽东思想也将指导他们取得彻底解放、进步和尊严。
    毛主席著作已成为非洲人民的精神食粮，并鼓舞他们进行革命斗争。在马里，一位书店的负责人最近对新华社记者说：马里人民热情欢迎毛主席著作，因为他的著作是革命的源泉，涉及革命的各个方面的问题，每一句话都有着深刻的意义。
    阿扎尼亚（南非）的一位自由战士在喜得一本《毛泽东选集》时，把它按在胸前激动地对新华社记者说，“这本书对我来说比任何其他东西都宝贵。当我随身带着这卷《毛泽东选集》的时候，我就充满了为祖国战斗到胜利的信心。”
    据新华社布拉柴维尔十四日电　刚果（布）人民从八月革命之后三年来，在一次又一次地粉碎了帝国主义和反动派的颠覆阴谋的过程中，越来越体会到毛泽东思想的伟大的指导意义。刚果（布）《独立》周刊最近发表了它的总编辑恩达拉写的一篇题为《不再怕鬼》的文章说，帝国主义最近在刚果（布）策动反革命政变被击败一事，“证实了毛泽东关于帝国主义和反动派无论怎样捣乱都注定要失败这一思想是正确的。”文章指出：一旦人民武装起来就能“抵御和击溃一切魔鬼”。
    文章说，“必须把人民从思想上武装起来，……处处突出政治”。“阶级斗争越激烈，贫苦人的阶级觉悟就越提高。帝国主义者、殖民主义者和他们的刚果走狗越是捣乱，他们就必然要遭到失败。可是他们不会因而罢休，我们……不能在胜利的道路上停下来，不能停止追击穷寇。”
    在六月二十七日帝国主义和反动派发动的一次政变被人民击败以后，刚果（布）的青年们已经进一步动员起来进行军事和政治训练。刚果（布）全国革命运动青年组织的一个支部的负责人对新华社记者说，毛主席的《将革命进行到底》这篇文章使他受到很大鼓舞。他对记者引述了文章中的一则希腊寓言：一个农夫由于可怜一条蛇，而结果被那条蛇咬死了。他说：“我们千万不可姑息养蛇，我们绝不能够对帝国主义抱幻想。”
    刚果（布）的一位高级负责官员在一次集会上号召刚果青年用枪杆子武装起来。他说：“现在帝国主义正在磨刀，我们也必须磨刀。人民争得的权利决不能轻易放弃，必须为保卫这些权利而战斗”。他在集会上引用毛主席的话说：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。”
    最近，刚果（布）人民法庭重新开庭，判处在一九六四年阴谋颠覆刚果（布）政府的前国家陆军副参谋长穆扎巴卡尼等人的死刑；判处从一九六二年至一九六五年不断向美国驻刚果（布）大使馆送情报的被美国收买的特务多纳蒂安等人的徒刑。人民法庭的一位法官对记者说：“必须对反革命分子实行专政。”他援引毛主席的话说：“只许他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动。”（附图片）
