Any great revolutionary movement must necessarily be a mass movement. Without the masses daring to speak, daring to act, and daring to charge forward, there can be no great revolution. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is no exception.

The Cultural Revolution aims to thoroughly criticize and repudiate the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes' old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits, and to establish proletarian and socialist new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits. Without the broad masses of the people participating in this movement, it would be impossible to achieve thorough criticism and repudiation, and it would be impossible to establish new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits.

Judging from the general historical situation, cultural revolution is always the forerunner of political and economic revolutions. The development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country cannot but touch upon politics and economics, and in fact, it has already done so.

The Cultural Revolution cannot be the affair of a few people; it cannot be merely a matter of criticizing a few bourgeois academic "authorities"; it cannot be merely a matter of criticizing a few bourgeois representatives. The laws governing the Cultural Revolution have completely broken through these confines.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has become a mass revolutionary movement. This is a major new sign that the Cultural Revolution is beginning to achieve victory.

The Red Guards have become the vanguard of this mass movement of the Cultural Revolution. We hail the heroic Red Guards! We salute our Red Guards!

Since the Red Guards took to the field, though not for long, they have truly shaken the whole of society and the old world. Their fighting edge is irresistible. All the old customs and habits of the exploiting classes have been swept out like garbage. All the old parasites hiding in dark corners have escaped the keen eyes of the Red Guards.

These bloodsuckers, these enemies of the people, are being one by one exposed by the Red Guards. Their hidden treasures of gold and silver have been exhibited by the Red Guards. Their hidden accounts for plotting counterrevolution and their weapons for killing people have also been displayed by the Red Guards. This is the merit of our Red Guards.

The actions of the Red Guards are truly excellent!

Chairman Mao pointed out as early as before the nation's victory: "The Chinese people will see that once China's destiny is in the hands of its own people, China will rise like the sun in the east and, with its brilliant radiance, illuminate the whole world, quickly sweep away the filth left by the reactionary government, heal the wounds of war, and build a brand-new, powerful, and genuine People's Republic that is worthy of the name." Our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has further proved the great foresight of Chairman Mao.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution now underway, with Mao Zedong Thought as its great banner and the Red Guards as its vanguard, will not only fundamentally change the spiritual outlook of our whole society but will also greatly improve our proletarian dictatorship, greatly consolidate our proletarian dictatorship, and reform many of the old social remnants and old forces of habit that are not in keeping with the proletarian dictatorship. It will greatly reform our socialist system, sweep away the remaining arrogance of the bourgeoisie in society, and further settle accounts with the capitalist system of exploitation.

Of course, the Red Guards need to learn in the course of struggle, to learn to engage in struggle through words, to learn to think.

The most fundamental question is that everyone needs to learn Mao Zedong Thought further in the course of struggle, master Mao Zedong Thought, apply Mao Zedong Thought, and temper oneself into a proletarian revolutionary who stands tall and firm, who has mastered revolutionary skills, who is a good student and a good fighter of Chairman Mao.

Long live the heroic Red Guards!

Long live our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao!

    向我们的红卫兵致敬！
    任何大革命运动，都必然是群众的革命运动。没有群众起来，敢说，敢干，敢闯，就不可能有什么大革命。无产阶级文化大革命，必然也是这样。
    文化大革命，就是要大破资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，大立无产阶级、社会主义的新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯。如果没有广大人民群众卷进这个运动，就不可能大破，也不可能大立。
    照一般的历史情况看，文化革命，总是政治革命、经济革命的先导。我国无产阶级文化大革命的发展，不可能不触及到政治，不可能不触及到经济，实际上已经触及了。
    文化大革命不能只是少数人的事情，不能只是批判几个资产阶级学者“权威”的事情，不能只是批判几个资产阶级代表人物的事情。文化大革命的规律，完全冲破了这些框框。
    无产阶级文化大革命，成为广大群众的革命运动。这是文化革命开始取得胜利的重大新标志。
    红卫兵充当了文化革命这个群众运动冲锋陷阵的急先锋。我们向英雄的红卫兵欢呼，向我们的红卫兵致敬！
    红卫兵上阵以来，时间并不久，但是，他们真正地把整个社会震动了，把旧世界震动了。他们的斗争锋芒，所向披靡。一切剥削阶级的旧风俗、旧习惯，都像垃圾一样，被他们扫地出门。一切藏在暗角里的老寄生虫，都逃不出红卫兵锐利的眼睛。
    这些吸血虫，这些人民的仇敌，正在一个一个地被红卫兵揪了出来。他们隐藏的金银财宝，被红卫兵拿出来展览了。他们隐藏的各种变天账，各种杀人武器，也被红卫兵拿出来示众了。这是我们红卫兵的功勋。
    红卫兵的行动，真是好得很！
    毛主席早在全国胜利前夕指出：“中国人民将会看见，中国的命运一经操在人民自己的手里，中国就将如太阳升起在东方那样，以自己的辉煌的光焰普照大地，迅速地荡涤反动政府留下来的污泥浊水，治好战争的创伤，建设起一个崭新的强盛的名副其实的人民共和国。”我们这场无产阶级文化大革命，恰恰进一步地证明了毛主席的伟大预见。
    现在正在进行的，以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的，以红卫兵为急先锋的这场无产阶级文化大革命，不但必将从根本上改变我们整个社会的精神面貌，而且必将大大改善我们的无产阶级专政，大大巩固我们的无产阶级专政，革新我们现在还存在着的许多不适合无产阶级专政的旧社会残迹，旧习惯势力；必将大大革新我们的社会主义制度，扫除资产阶级在社会上还存在着的一些威风，进一步清算资本主义的剥削制度。
    当然，红卫兵随时需要在斗争中学习，学会文斗，学会思考。
    最根本的问题是，大家需要在斗争中进一步学会毛泽东思想，掌握毛泽东思想，运用毛泽东思想，把自己锻炼成为顶天立地、掌握革命本领的无产阶级革命者，成为毛主席的好学生，好战士。
    英雄的红卫兵万岁！
    我们伟大的导师，伟大的领袖，伟大的统帅，伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！
