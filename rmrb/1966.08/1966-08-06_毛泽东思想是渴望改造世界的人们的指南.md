New Zealand Communist Party General Secretary Wilcock Congratulates the 45th Anniversary of the Founding of the Chinese Communist Party
Mao Zedong Thought is the Guide for Those Who Yearn to Transform the World
The CPC's Leadership in Anti-Revisionist Struggle Has Made Inestimable Contributions to the Revolutionary People of All Countries

WELLINGTON, Aug. 2 (New China News Agency) — In a statement issued on behalf of the National Secretariat of the New Zealand Communist Party, General Secretary Wilcock said: "The Chinese Communist Party has creatively applied Marxism-Leninism to the conditions of its own country, setting a great example for the whole world. Under the leadership of the contemporary great Marxist-Leninist Mao Zedong, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has brilliantly combined the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete realities of the Chinese revolution."

The statement, which congratulates the 45th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, points out: "Today, China is a great bastion of the world's people in their struggle against the savage atrocities of the common enemy of mankind, American imperialism. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, China has never wavered in its determination to defend the interests of the working people of the world in the face of American nuclear threats and constant war provocations.

	"The peoples of colonial and dependent countries engaged in national liberation struggles against imperialist oppression have drawn strength from the knowledge that China supports their cause and that the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party stand shoulder to shoulder with them in their struggle.

		"First and foremost, this is the case with the long-fighting people of Vietnam. They bravely resist the armed forces of the American invaders, and they are firmly convinced that, whatever happens, China will stand by their side."

The statement says: "Just as the Chinese Communist Party stands at the forefront of the anti-imperialist struggle, it also stands at the forefront of the struggle for the unity of the world communist movement on the basis of Marxism-Leninism."

The statement praises: "The Chinese Communist Party's leadership in the struggle against the attempts by Khrushchev and his revisionist followers to emasculate the revolutionary content of Marxism-Leninism has made inestimable contributions to the international working class and the revolutionary peoples of all countries. The Chinese Communist Party has played a leading role in exposing their (the Soviet Communist Party leadership's) betrayals and in defending the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism among the genuine revolutionaries in the communist movement."

The statement points out: "The Chinese Communist Party's firmness in applying and adhering to the basic principles of communism, and in defending proletarian internationalism and Marxist-Leninist thought, is mainly due to the outstanding leadership and creative genius of Comrade Mao Zedong."

The statement warmly praises Mao Zedong Thought, saying: "Comrade Mao Zedong has creatively enriched the teachings of the great Marxist-Leninists of the past — Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin — in his theoretical works. Comrade Mao Zedong's works brilliantly combine the scientific attitude of Marxism-Leninism with the heroic revolutionary spirit. These works express the thoughts of a great revolutionary and are a guide and inspiration for all those who yearn to transform the world.

		"Mao Zedong Thought has guided the Chinese Communist Party from victory to victory in the most difficult and complex circumstances, and is the embodiment of Marxism-Leninism in the present era when imperialism is heading for decline and the whole world is moving towards socialism."

The statement says that it is Comrade Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, based on a profound analysis of the developing world situation, who first pointed out that the center of the revolutionary storm has shifted from Europe and the West to Asia, Africa, and Latin America. This correct view emphasizes that the working class of the West must unite with and support the struggles of the oppressed nations, while at the same time pointing out the way forward for the national liberation movements and the working class of developed capitalist countries, including New Zealand.

The statement says that Comrade Mao Zedong's point that in the cultural and ideological spheres, the socialist revolution must be carried through to the end is of great significance.

The statement points out: "The experience of the world communist movement is that the elimination of deeply rooted bourgeois ideology takes much longer than the actual political revolution. Only by carrying the class struggle through to the end and regarding it as a necessary task of the socialist revolution can the bourgeois ideology be eliminated."

The statement says that Comrade Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party have pointed out that recognizing this necessity arms the minds of the working class and all revolutionaries to prevent the danger of ideological degeneration within the communist parties of socialist countries, and thus prevent the possibility of a "peaceful transition" from socialism to capitalism as is now occurring in the Soviet Union and certain other socialist countries under revisionist leadership. The statement praises the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution now underway in China, seeing it as a manifestation of the Chinese people's determination not to allow the restoration of capitalism.

The statement says: "Comrade Mao Zedong's leadership and theoretical works have a decisive and great significance in that they have, for the first time in history, made the science of Marxism-Leninism the daily guide and tool of tens of millions of people. Therefore, the theory of Marxism-Leninism has become a great material force for the further rapid development of China's economy and culture. At the same time, it has formed a new great impetus internationally, bringing the problem of the working people's mastery of Marxism-Leninism to the fore."

The statement concludes: "Our party is convinced that the Chinese Communist Party will continue to carry forward the glorious traditions established in its 45-year history of struggle and will further advance the cause of world socialism."

    新共总书记威尔科克斯祝贺中国共产党成立四十五周年
    毛泽东思想是渴望改造世界的人们的指南
    中共领导反修斗争对各国革命人民作出了无可估量的贡献
    新华社惠灵顿电　新西兰共产党总书记威尔科克斯二日以新西兰共产党全国书记处名义发表声明说：“中国共产党创造性地把马克思列宁主义运用于本国的条件，为全世界树立了一个伟大的榜样。以当代伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东为首的中国共产党中央委员会，光辉地把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命的具体实际结合了起来。”
    这篇祝贺中国共产党成立四十五周年的声明指出：“今天，中国是世界人民反对全人类的公敌美帝国主义的野蛮暴行的伟大堡垒。在中国共产党的领导下，中国在美国核威胁和不断的战争挑衅面前它的维护世界劳动人民利益的决心从来没有动摇过。
      “正在进行民族解放斗争、反对帝国主义压迫的殖民地国家和附属国的人民，由于知道有中国支持他们的事业，知道中国人民和中国（共产）党在斗争中同他们并肩站在一起而汲取了力量。
      “首先，久经战斗的越南人民的情况就是这样。他们英勇地抗击美国侵略者的武装力量，他们坚信，不管发生什么情况，中国一定会站在他们一边。”
    声明说：“正如中国共产党站在反帝斗争的最前列一样，中国共产党也站在为世界共产主义运动在马克思列宁主义基础上的团结而斗争的最前列。”
    声明赞扬说：“中国共产党领导为反对赫鲁晓夫及其修正主义追随者阉割马克思列宁主义的革命内容的企图而进行的斗争，对国际工人阶级和各国革命人民作出了无可估量的贡献。”“中国共产党在揭露他们（苏联共产党领导）的背叛和团结共产主义运动中的真正革命者维护马克思列宁主义的基本原则方面发挥了领导作用。”
    声明指出：“中国共产党在运用和坚持共产主义的基本原则方面，在维护无产阶级国际主义和马克思列宁主义思想方面的坚定性，主要是由于毛泽东同志的杰出领导和他的创造性的天才。”
    声明热烈赞扬毛泽东思想说：“毛泽东同志在他的理论著作中创造性地丰富了过去的伟大马克思列宁主义者——马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林——的学说。毛泽东同志的著作卓越地把马克思列宁主义的科学态度同豪迈的革命精神结合起来。这些著作表达了一位伟大的革命者的思想，是指导和鼓舞一切渴望改造世界的人们的指南。
      “毛泽东思想曾在最困难和最复杂的环境中指导中国共产党从胜利走向胜利，是马克思列宁主义在当前帝国主义走向没落、全世界向着社会主义过渡的时代中的体现。”
    声明说，正是毛泽东同志和中国共产党根据对发展中的世界形势的深刻分析，最先指出革命的风暴中心已经从欧洲和西方转移到亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲。这个正确的观点强调西方工人阶级必须同被压迫民族团结起来和支持他们的斗争，同时指出民族解放运动和包括新西兰在内的发达的资本主义国家的工人阶级前进的道路。
    声明说，毛泽东同志所指出的在文化和意识形态方面，必须把社会主义革命进行到底的论点是具有极其重大意义的贡献。
    声明指出：“世界共产主义运动的经验是，消灭根深蒂固的资产阶级意识形态，比实际的政治革命所需时间要长得多。只要把阶级斗争进行到底，把它作为社会主义革命的必要任务，才能够消灭资产阶级意识形态。”
    声明说，毛泽东同志和中国共产党指出，认识这种必要性就使工人阶级和一切革命者的头脑武装起来防止社会主义国家的共产党内思想蜕化的危险，从而防止象在修正主义领导下的苏联和某些社会主义国家现在正发生的从社会主义倒退到资本主义的“和平过渡”那种可能性。声明赞扬中国正在进行的文化大革命，认为这表明中国人民决不容许资本主义复辟的决心。
    声明说：“毛泽东同志的领导和理论著作，在这样一个方面具有决定性的重大意义，即史无前例地使马克思列宁主义的科学成为千百万人的日常指南和工具。因此，马克思列宁主义的理论已经成为中国的经济和文化进一步迅速发展的强大的物质力量。同时，在国际上形成一股新的巨大的动力，把劳动人民群众掌握马克思列宁主义的问题提上日程。”
    声明最后说：“我们党深信，中国共产党将继续发扬在四十五年的斗争历史中建立的光荣传统，将进一步推进世界社会主义的事业。”
