Revolutionary helmsman Chairman Mao, four volumes of red books are the truth.
Every word and sentence speaks of revolution, generation after generation cannot leave.

Millions of people cheer: The Party Central Committee's decision to mass-produce Chairman Mao's works is excellent!

According to Xinhua News Agency on the 9th, people from all walks of life across the country, including workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres, enthusiastically welcomed the decision of the Party Central Committee to speed up the mass production of Chairman Mao's works. They expressed that the Party Central Committee's decision is the greatest concern for our politics. We must further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, actively participate in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, and turn the entire country into a great school for studying Mao Zedong Thought.

The vast number of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres in Hubei Province welcomed the decision of the Communist Party of China Central Committee to mass-produce Chairman Mao's works with great excitement. National People's Congress representative, engineer of Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, Ma Xueli, and National People's Congress representative, Party branch secretary of the First Rice Mill in Hanjiang District, Wuhan, Zhang Shifu, unanimously expressed: Chairman Mao's books are revolutionary books. We, the working class, are the class that makes revolution, and we love to read Chairman Mao's books the most. Chairman Mao's books are the steering wheel and compass for making revolution and building the country, the treasure among treasures. Mastering Mao Zedong Thought will turn into a great material force and become a critic of the old world and a builder of the new world.

People in Tianjin, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, and Handan in Hebei Province were overjoyed and excited to hear the news of the Communist Party of China Central Committee's decision to mass-produce Chairman Mao's works. Many factories, production teams, schools, and offices held meetings or discussions; many people wrote articles, letters, made phone calls, and sent telegrams to newspapers, expressing their enthusiastic support for the Party Central Committee's decision. Workers on the industrial and commercial fronts in Tianjin, revolutionary teachers and students, and community members in the suburbs enthusiastically celebrated this great event at the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China.

After the good news reached Beiguan Commune in Licheng County, Shandong Province, Li Shucheng, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works and Party branch secretary of Shuitun Brigade, said: In 1958, our great leader Chairman Mao came to Beiguan for an inspection and personally instructed us, "The people's commune is good!" We followed Chairman Mao's instructions to establish the people's commune, turning the North Great Marsh into a stable and high-yielding field, ensuring bumper harvests year after year. In the future, we will read Chairman Mao's books better and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

Huang Linhai, the leader of the study group of Chairman Mao's works in the lathe workshop of the First Automobile Works in Changchun, said: "In the past, we couldn't buy 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong,' so we bought individual volumes and copied quotations from newspapers to persist in studying. Now the Party Central Committee has decided to mass-produce Chairman Mao's works, which is truly great."

Wei Shuqin, a labor model in Harbin and deputy political instructor of the Seventh Department Store, said: "We enthusiastically support this wise decision of the Party Central Committee. Chairman Mao's books are our lifeline. A few years ago, there were few people in our group who had Chairman Mao's books, but everyone was eager to read them. After work, we borrowed and copied Chairman Mao's works to read. Now, the Party Central Committee is going to mass-produce Chairman Mao's works for us. We must read Chairman Mao's books seriously for life and do revolution for life." Liu Yingjun's former comrade-in-arms, Liu Fengjiu, said: "The mass production of Chairman Mao's works is a top priority in the political life of workers, peasants, and soldiers. I will resolutely follow the example of Comrade Liu Yingjun, taking Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle for all my actions, following the path of heroes, striving to study Mao Zedong Thought, faithfully implementing Mao Zedong Thought, enthusiastically propagating Mao Zedong Thought, bravely defending Mao Zedong Thought, and forever being a good soldier of Chairman Mao."

Sun Youyu, a worker from the 13th Metallurgical Company in Shanxi Province, once spent ten months copying down every word of the four volumes of Chairman Mao's works because he couldn't buy them. Today, after hearing the news of the Communist Party of China Central Committee's decision to mass-produce Chairman Mao's works, he was overjoyed. He wrote in his notebook: "Revolutionary helmsman Chairman Mao, four volumes of red books are the truth. Every word and sentence speaks of revolution, generation after generation cannot leave." He expressed: In the future, when we buy Chairman Mao's books, we must study them seriously and use them seriously, do revolution for life, and study Chairman Mao's works for life.

The vast number of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres in Zhejiang Province compared the Party Central Committee's decision to timely rain. Yang Jiaming, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works in a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army in Zhejiang, said: "Our soldiers said well: No matter how much we love, we love Chairman Mao's books the most; no matter how much we listen, we listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. We rely on Mao Zedong Thought to make revolution. The Party Central Committee's decision to speed up the mass production of Chairman Mao's works fully expresses the urgent wishes of us revolutionary soldiers."

According to Xinhua News Agency on the 9th, after the joyous news of the Communist Party of China Central Committee's decision to speed up the mass production of Chairman Mao's works was announced, the vast number of workers in the publishing, printing, and distribution departments in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Tianjin, Chengdu, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Hohhot, Urumqi, and Nanning were greatly inspired. They decided to respond to the great call of the Party Central Committee with practical actions, with the deepest class feelings, the highest revolutionary spirit, and the most serious work attitude, to quickly and massively print Chairman Mao's works, and deliver this powerful ideological weapon to the vast number of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals who are carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The workers in various printing plants in Beijing, which are responsible for the mass printing of Chairman Mao's works, were extremely moved after hearing the Party Central Committee's decision. The workers of Xinhua Printing Plant posted determination letters and guarantees, expressing their determination to complete this most glorious task with unparalleled pride. This plant was once controlled by the black gang, and the number of Chairman Mao's works printed was less than one-fourth of the total number of prints. Now, the workers, with high political enthusiasm, have taken more effective measures to start all the printing machines, prioritizing the printing of Chairman Mao's works. The workers guaranteed that they would print Chairman Mao's books quickly, in large quantities, and of high quality.

On the day the Party Central Committee's decision was published in the newspaper, the workers of the mail-order department of Beijing New China Bookstore sent out more than five hundred sets of the popular edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" to readers across the country. Before this, the total number of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" sent by this mail-order department since its establishment in 1962 was only over six hundred sets.

Many printing plants in Shanghai are busy printing Chairman Mao's works. The workers said: The Party Central Committee's decision to speed up the mass production of Chairman Mao's works is a great joy for the people of the whole country and the world, and it is also a landmark event in the history of printing! The printing workers arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, break the bourgeois technical "experts'" foreign frameworks and doctrines in printing, and expand the printing capacity. The workers of the offset printing workshop of the Shanghai Printing Plant of Zhonghua Book Company racked their brains and found a way to successfully print books with offset printing machines that were originally used to print pictures.

The vast number of workers in the publishing, printing, and distribution departments in Guangdong and Tianjin have been politically enthusiastic and fully devoted to the work of publishing, printing, and distributing Chairman Mao's works in recent days. Sixteen printing plants in Liaoning Province and nineteen printing plants in Jiangsu Province have started mass-producing Chairman Mao's works one after another. The workers expressed their determination to, with their unlimited love for Chairman Mao and their intense class hatred for the enemy, ensure that Chairman Mao's works are printed with the highest quality and the fastest speed. The Party Central Committee's decision greatly inspired the workers in Hohhot, Urumqi, Nanning, and Chengdu, who are responsible for printing Chairman Mao's works. The workers of the Inner Mongolia Printing Plant and the Xinjiang Printing Plant, who are undertaking the task of mass printing Chairman Mao's works for the first time, were excited after hearing the Party Central Committee's decision. The workers decided to follow Chairman Mao's teachings of self-reliance, strive to overcome unfavorable factors, and print Chairman Mao's works quickly, in large quantities, and of high quality.

After the joyous news of the Communist Party of China Central Committee's decision to mass-produce Chairman Mao's works reached the Shenyang Xinhua Printing Plant, the workers expressed their determination to the Party, vowing to complete the glorious task of printing Chairman Mao's works with high quality.
