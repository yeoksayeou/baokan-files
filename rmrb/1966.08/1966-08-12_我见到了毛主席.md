	I Saw Chairman Mao
	Lei Ruifang

	For many years, I have longed to see Chairman Mao. One night, I dreamt of seeing Chairman Mao and was so happy that I called out in my sleep. When my husband woke me up, I was still immersed in the joy of the dream. After being transferred to Beijing to work in April this year, my first wish was to see Chairman Mao. Whether it was during holiday outings, welcoming foreign guests, or rallies and parades, I always tried to participate, hoping to see Chairman Mao.

	The moment of happiness finally arrived. On August 10, 1966, this day, I will never forget it. That afternoon, I happened to be serving at the reception station of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. At around 7 PM, Chairman Mao came to the reception station to meet with revolutionary masses. At that time, the place was crowded with people, and there was no path. I, along with the comrades around me, held hands and pushed our way through, clearing a path for the Chairman to walk to the stage of the reception station. I also followed the Chairman onto the stage. The Chairman said to the reporting team, "Comrades, good! Comrades, good!" and extended his hand to shake hands with everyone warmly. Seeing the Chairman's tall figure and healthy face, I shed tears of happiness and called out, "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao!" with a voice trembling with excitement. Chairman Mao smiled kindly and asked me, "Are you here to serve? Where are you from?" I replied to the Chairman, "I am here to serve. I am a staff member of the Central Committee's Office." The Chairman shook hands with me and also shook hands with the other comrades on the stage. At this moment, the stage below and above was filled with cheers: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!" The masses pushed closer and closer to the stage, and more and more people stretched out countless hands to shake hands with the Chairman. To satisfy everyone's wishes, the Chairman shook hands with everyone one by one until the comrades on the stage repeatedly urged the Chairman to rest, and only then did he wave goodbye to everyone and leave. At that moment, my feelings were very conflicted. I was afraid of pushing the Chairman, afraid that the Chairman would be tired, but I also did not want the Chairman to leave, even if it was just a few more seconds of being with us, it would be a great happiness.

	After Chairman Mao left, the masses still did not want to leave for a long time. The voice of "Long live Chairman Mao" echoed through the sky. My emotions also could not calm down for a long time. It was nine o'clock, and I had not eaten dinner, but I did not feel hungry at all. When I returned to the office, I did not think about eating at all. I was eager to share my happiness with everyone and told my comrades, "I saw Chairman Mao, I saw Chairman Mao!"

	When I got home, my hands were still stained with ink, ink, glue, and sweat, but I did not want to wash them. I hugged my child and stroked her little face and hands with the hand that had shaken Chairman Mao's. She seemed to understand her mother's feelings and jumped with joy. Child, you are truly blessed. You have been bathed in the sunlight of Chairman Mao since you were young, and you will never be like your mother, serving as a maid for a landlord.

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! It is you who saved me, it is you who gave me happiness, making me, a miserable child, become the master of the country, a state worker, and a member of the great and glorious Communist Party of China.

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Your glory illuminates my heart, making me understand love and hate, making me understand the truth of revolution. I have learned from your works, my mind is clear; I have learned from your works, my love and hatred are distinct. When I learned that a small group of people wanted to oppose the Party, oppose socialism, and oppose Mao Zedong Thought, I hated them to death and was determined to fight to the end!

	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great cause that concerns the fate of the Chinese people and the people of the world. I firmly support the Party Central Committee's decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In this great revolution, I will definitely study and apply Chairman Mao's works more actively, arm myself with Mao Zedong Thought, fight against the ghosts and monsters, and struggle against old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits. I will defend the great Party, defend the great Chairman Mao, defend the great Mao Zedong Thought, and defend the socialist mountains and rivers. I will also use Mao Zedong Thought to continuously reform myself, never fall behind, and dedicate my life to the revolution, read Chairman Mao's books for life, and always be a good soldier of Chairman Mao, always follow Chairman Mao.

	Long live Chairman Mao!
	Long live the Communist Party of China!
	Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!
	Wish Chairman Mao eternal life!

### 我见到了毛主席

　　我见到了毛主席
　　雷瑞芳
    多年来，我一直渴望着能看见毛主席。一个晚上，我在睡梦中见到了毛主席，高兴得叫出声来。当我爱人将我叫醒时，我还沉醉在幸福的梦境里。今年四月调来北京工作后，我的第一个心愿就是见到毛主席。节日游园，欢迎外宾，集会游行……，只要有机会，我都争取参加，希望能看到毛主席。
    幸福的时刻终于到来了。一九六六年八月十日，这个日子，我一辈子也忘不了。这天下午我正好在中共中央办公厅接待站服务，七时多，毛主席到接待站来和革命群众见面了。当时人山人海，挤得没有路，我和周围的同志一起，手拉着手，拨开了一条路，让主席走到了接待站的讲台上，我也跟着主席到了台上。主席向着报喜的队伍说：“同志们好！同志们好！”并伸出手和大家热烈握手。看着主席高大的身躯，健壮的脸色，我流着幸福的热泪，用激动得有点发抖的声音喊着：“毛主席，毛主席！”毛主席慈祥地微笑着问我：“你来服务的吗？你哪里的啊？”我回答主席：“我是来服务的。我是中央办公厅的工作人员。”主席和我握了手，还和台上的其他同志一一握了手。这时台下台上一片欢呼声：毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！群众往台前越挤越近，越来越多，大家伸出无数双手，要和主席握手。主席为了满足大家的要求，一一和大家握手，直到台上的同志几次催促主席休息，他老人家才和大家招手离去。我当时的心情非常矛盾，怕挤着主席，怕主席累了，但又舍不得主席走，那怕多和我们在一起几秒钟也是极大的幸福。
    毛主席走后，群众还是久久不肯离去。“毛主席万岁”的声音响彻云霄。我的心情也久久不能平静，九点钟了，还未吃晚饭，一点也不感到饿。回到机关，我根本没想着吃饭，我急着把幸福分享给大家，见到同志就说：“我看见毛主席了，我看见毛主席了！”
    到了家里，我的手上虽然还有墨水、墨汁、浆糊、汗水，可是我舍不得洗手。我抱起孩子，用和毛主席握过的手，抚摸着她的小脸和小手。她好象能理解妈妈的心情似地高兴得直蹦直跳。孩子啊！你真幸福，你从小就有毛主席的阳光沐浴，你再也不会象妈妈那样，给地主当丫头了。
    毛主席啊！毛主席！是您救了我，是您给我的幸福，使我这个苦命的孩子成为国家的主人，成了国家的工作人员，还参加了伟大光荣的中国共产党。
    毛主席啊！毛主席！您的光辉照亮我的心，使我懂得了爱和恨，使我懂得了革命真理。我学了您的著作，心明眼亮；我学了您的著作，爱憎分明……。当我知道有一小撮人要反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的时候，我恨死他们了，要跟他们拚到底！
    无产阶级文化大革命是关系着中国人民和世界人民命运的大事。我坚决拥护党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定。在这场大革命中，我一定要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，向牛鬼蛇神开火，向旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯作斗争，保卫伟大的党，保卫伟大的毛主席，保卫伟大的毛泽东思想，保卫社会主义的江山。我也要用毛泽东思想不断改造自己，永不掉队，干一辈子革命，读一辈子毛主席的书，永远做毛主席的好战士，永远跟着毛主席走。
    毛主席万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    祝毛主席万寿无疆！
