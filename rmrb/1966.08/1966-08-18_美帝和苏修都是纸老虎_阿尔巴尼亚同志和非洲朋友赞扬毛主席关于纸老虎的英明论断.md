The U.S. Imperialists and Soviet Revisionists Are Paper Tigers
Albanian Comrades and African Friends Praise Chairman Mao's Brilliant Judgment on Paper Tigers

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Tirana on the 17th, the secretary of the Albanian Veterans' Association, Vilel Dedja, enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao's speech made twenty years ago about imperialism and all reactionaries being paper tigers. He said, "Comrade Mao Zedong's speech and his brilliant judgment on imperialism and all reactionaries being paper tigers are a great and immortal contribution to Marxist-Leninist theory. It has powerfully armed the international communist, national liberation, and people's revolutionary movements, becoming the guiding ideology for the Chinese people, the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe and North America in their struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries to achieve thorough liberation."

He emphasized, "Now, with the United States at the helm, imperialism, with the Soviet Communist Party leadership as the center of modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries are colluding to oppose and attempt to isolate and encircle China and Albania. However, the ones who are becoming increasingly isolated and surrounded by the people of the world are precisely they themselves. This proves that U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism are nothing but paper tigers."

Dedja said that the brilliant victories achieved by the Vietnamese people through their heroic struggle have proven the correctness of Chairman Mao's judgment. The Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation struggle has once again proven this great truth: the decisive factor in war is not weapons, but the just people.

Dedja pointed out, "Revolutionary people, if they follow the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong, fully understand the dual nature of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries, and in strategy despise the enemy while in tactics take the enemy seriously, can be invincible." Dedja said passionately, "With great enthusiasm and a revolutionary sense of responsibility, I study the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, Mao Zedong, and Hoxha to make myself an indefatigable warrior for revolution and construction." He said, "I love reading Chairman Mao's works very much, the more I read, the more inspired I am."

Albanian Peace Defense Committee member and famous historian Ali Bali said to a New China News Agency reporter, "Comrade Mao Zedong is a great Marxist-Leninist and a great revolutionary. Under specific historical conditions, he deeply analyzed the nature of imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, and made the most correct judgment, solving the problem of how to deal with it strategically and tactically." He said, "Comrade Mao Zedong's teaching of despising the enemy strategically and taking the enemy seriously tactically is the victorious weapon for all revolutionary people to struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries."

According to a report from the New China News Agency on the 17th, Chairman Mao's brilliant judgment that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers has armed the African people in their struggle, making them believe in their own strength, despise the enemy, dare to struggle, and dare to win.

A Congolese (Leopoldville) revolutionary leader said that the development of people's struggles has proven the correctness of Chairman Mao's judgment. When the masses rise up to oppose imperialism and its puppets, the people become an inexhaustible force against the seemingly powerful but actually doomed-to-be-crushed imperialist forces.

A young man from Southwest Africa said, "We oppressed people believe in Chairman Mao's conclusion, dare to fight, and dare to make a revolution."

He said, "Modern revisionists regard imperialism as a tiger with atomic bomb teeth, and do not hesitate to sacrifice the oppressed people to seek peaceful coexistence with U.S. imperialism. The war threats of U.S. imperialism scare them to death, and they have abandoned people's war and revolution. This shows why they are so eager to negotiate with U.S. imperialism on the Vietnamese issue."

A friend from Azania (South Africa) in Cairo said, "Today, the anti-imperialist forces in Africa, Asia, and Latin America have all proven Chairman Mao's judgment that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers."

He said, "The African people have decided to use revolutionary violence to counter revolutionary violence. Despite the imperialists' possession of modern weapons and atomic devices, they cannot stop the African people from advancing to victory. As Chairman Mao pointed out, the decisive factor in any war is not weapons but people."

A Basutoland freedom fighter said, "We freedom fighters should take Chairman Mao's words as the basis of our strategy and the guiding principle for our struggle against imperialism and reactionaries."

A Zimbabwean freedom fighter said, "Since we launched our armed struggle three months ago, Smith has not been able to extinguish this struggle. Our experience has proven Chairman Mao's teaching that people are the decisive factor in struggle."

A Mozambican nationalist said, "Mozambican warriors, when they engage in armed struggle and rely on the masses, become powerful."

A Bechuanaland freedom fighter said, "The African people armed with Chairman Mao's thought will despise all difficulties created by the imperialists, resolutely counter imperialist provocations. Through struggle and victory, they will once again prove to the world that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers."

### 美帝和苏修都是纸老虎  阿尔巴尼亚同志和非洲朋友赞扬毛主席关于纸老虎的英明论断

　　美帝和苏修都是纸老虎
　　阿尔巴尼亚同志和非洲朋友赞扬毛主席关于纸老虎的英明论断
    据新华社地拉那十七日电　阿尔巴尼亚老战士协会秘书长维列·戴迪热烈赞扬毛主席在二十年前发表的关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的谈话。他说：“毛泽东同志的这个谈话和他所提出的关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断，是对马克思列宁主义学说的一个重大的不朽的贡献。它有力地武装了国际共产主义、民族解放和人民革命运动，成为中国人民、亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民以及欧洲和北美洲人民反对帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派，争取彻底解放的指导思想”。
    他强调指出：“现在以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派正在相互勾结，反对并妄图孤立、包围中国和阿尔巴尼亚，但是越来越孤立、越来越被世界人民所包围的恰恰是他们自己。”“这证明美帝国主义和苏联修正主义也不过是纸老虎。”
    戴迪说，越南人民用自己的英勇斗争所取得的辉煌胜利，证明了毛主席论断的正确性。越南人民的抗美救国斗争再次证明了这一伟大真理：决定战争胜负的不是武器，而是正义的人民。
    戴迪指出：“革命的人民，如果按照毛泽东同志的教导，充分认识帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派的两重性，在战略上藐视敌人，在战术上重视敌人，就能无往不胜。”戴迪满怀激情地说：“我怀着巨大的热情和革命者的责任心学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林、毛泽东和霍查的著作，以便使自己成为不知疲倦的革命和建设的战士。”他说：“我很爱读毛主席著作，我越读受的启发就越大。”
    阿尔巴尼亚保卫和平委员会委员、著名历史学家阿利巴利对新华社记者说，“毛泽东同志是伟大的马克思列宁主义者、伟大的革命家，他在具体的历史条件下，深刻地分析了帝国主义、特别是美帝国主义的本性，做出了最正确的论断，解决了在战略和战术上如何对待它的问题。”他说：“毛泽东同志的战略上藐视敌人，战术上重视敌人的教导，是一切革命人民为反对帝国主义、反对修正主义、反对一切反动派而斗争的胜利的武器。”
    据新华社十七日讯　毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断，在思想上武装了战斗中的非洲人民，使他们相信自己的力量，藐视敌人，敢于斗争，敢于胜利。
    一个刚果（利）革命领导人说，人民斗争的发展证明了毛主席这一论断的正确性。当人民群众起来反对帝国主义及其傀儡的时候，人民就成为反对貌似强大而事实上注定要被粉碎的帝国主义势力的无穷无尽的力量。
    一位西南非洲青年说：“我们被压迫的人民相信毛主席的结论，敢于战斗，敢于进行革命。”
    他说：“现代修正主义者认为帝国主义是装有原子弹牙齿的老虎，不惜牺牲被压迫的人民乞求同美帝国主义和平共处。美帝国主义的战争威胁把他们吓得要死，他们放弃了人民战争和革命。这就说明了他们为什么急于在越南问题上同美帝国主义进行谈判。”
    一位在开罗的阿扎尼亚（南非）朋友说，今天，非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲的反帝力量“都证明了毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的论断。”
    他说，非洲人民决定以革命的暴力来对付反革命暴力。帝国主义者尽管拥有现代化武器和原子装置，他们仍然不能阻挡非洲人民胜利前进。正如毛主席所强调指出的，任何战争中的决定性因素不是武器而是人。
    一位巴苏陀兰自由战士说：“我们自由战士应当把毛主席的话当作我们战略的基础，当作我们对帝国主义和反动派斗争的指导原则。”
    津巴布韦的自由战士说，“自从我们三个月以前发动武装斗争以来，史密斯没有能扑灭这个斗争。”“我们的经验证明了毛主席的教导，人民是斗争中的决定性因素。”
    一位莫三鼻给民族主义者指出，“莫三鼻给战士在进行武装斗争、依靠广大群众的时候，就强大起来了。”
    一位贝专纳自由战士说，“用毛主席思想武装起来的非洲人民将蔑视帝国主义者制造的一切困难，坚决地对付帝国主义的挑衅。他们通过斗争和胜利，将向世界再一次证明帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。”
