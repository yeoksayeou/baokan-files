On August 18, at the mass rally in the capital celebrating the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I saw our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao. His health is excellent, which is the greatest happiness for all of us revolutionary teachers, students, and staff, and the greatest happiness for the people of the entire nation and the world! I shook Chairman Mao's hand tightly and sincerely wished our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, eternal life!

Our most beloved Chairman Mao wore our "Red Guards" armband. When we met Chairman Mao in the rest room, a few "Red Guards" from Tsinghua University Middle School said, "We will forever rebel against the bourgeoisie and revisionism." Chairman Mao happily said, "I firmly support you."

Revolutionary teachers, students, and staff, revolutionary comrades! We must study the Sixteen Points, be familiar with the Sixteen Points, master the Sixteen Points, and use the Sixteen Points to overthrow those in power who are taking the capitalist road, to overthrow the reactionary authorities of the bourgeoisie, to overthrow all the bourgeois reactionaries, to oppose all kinds of behavior that suppresses the revolution, and to overthrow all the monsters and demons! Let them never rise again!

We are the most loyal "Red Guards" defending Mao Zedong Thought, a daring, bold, revolutionary, and rebellious force. Our commander is our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao. Rebellion is the tradition of our proletarian revolutionaries. We rebelled in the past, we rebel now, and we will rebel in the future! As long as class and class struggle exist, we will rebel against the bourgeoisie!

We "Red Guards" solemnly pledge to the beloved Party Central Committee and to our supreme commander, Chairman Mao: We will definitely follow our great commander, Chairman Mao, and open fire on all those within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, on all monsters and demons, and on all the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes. We will use the Sixteen Points as a sharp weapon to completely defeat and annihilate them, and resolutely complete the tasks of "struggle, criticism, and reform." We will not stop until we achieve complete victory! We will use our lives and blood to defend the Party Central Committee, defend Chairman Mao, defend the great Mao Zedong Thought, and defend the people's red regime!

We will rebel against the bourgeoisie, against revisionism, against all monsters and demons, and against all reactionaries for our entire lives! We will forever shout: Rebellion is justified!

Long live the revolutionary spirit of proletarian rebellion!
Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!
Long live the great Communist Party of China!
Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!
Long live our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!

    毛主席率领“红卫兵”前进
    哈尔滨工程学院“红卫兵”　李晶
    八月十八日，在首都庆祝无产阶级文化大革命的群众大会上，我见到了最最敬爱的领袖毛主席。他老人家身体很健康，这是我们全体革命师生员工的最大幸福，是全国人民全世界人民的最大幸福！我紧紧握着毛主席的手，最衷心地祝愿我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席万寿无疆！
    最最敬爱的毛主席，戴上了我们“红卫兵”的袖章。我们在休息室会见毛主席的时候，清华大学附中的几个“红卫兵”说：“我们要永远造资产阶级和修正主义的反。”毛主席高兴地说：“我坚决支持你们。”
    革命的师生员工们，革命的同志们！我们一定要学习十六条，熟悉十六条，掌握十六条，运用十六条，打倒走资本主义道路的当权派，打倒资产阶级的反动权威，打倒一切资产阶级保皇派，反对形形色色的压制革命的行为，打倒一切牛鬼蛇神！叫他们永世不得翻身！
    我们是捍卫毛泽东思想的最忠实的“红卫兵”，是一支敢闯、敢干、敢革命、敢造反的队伍。我们的统帅，是最最敬爱的领袖毛主席。造反，是我们无产阶级革命者的传统。我们过去造反，现在造反，将来还要造反！只要阶级和阶级斗争存在，我们就要造资产阶级的反！
    我们“红卫兵”，向敬爱的党中央、向我们的最高统帅毛主席庄严宣誓：我们一定紧跟我们伟大的统帅毛主席，向一切党内走资本主义道路的当权派，向一切牛鬼蛇神，向一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯猛烈开火，运用十六条这个锐利的战斗武器，把它们彻底打垮，彻底消灭，坚决完成“一斗、二批、三改”的任务，不获全胜，决不收兵！我们要用生命和鲜血保卫党中央，保卫毛主席！捍卫伟大的毛泽东思想，捍卫人民的红色江山！
    我们要一辈子造资产阶级的反，造修正主义的反，造一切牛鬼蛇神的反，造一切反动派的反！一辈子高呼：造反有理！
    无产阶级的革命造反精神万岁！
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
