In 1961, when the "ghosts and monsters" were stirring up a "reversal of verdicts" storm, Zhou Yang personally took the stage. From March 17th to 19th, he had three discussions with the film crew of "The Life of Lu Xun" in Hangzhou, firing one poisoned arrow after another at Lu Xun.

Zhou Yang openly opposed Chairman Mao's evaluation of Lu Xun, trying to politically belittle him. He said, "Lu Xun was not a political activist. He did not participate in actual struggles." He ordered, "Do not portray Lu Xun as too closely involved in political struggles, as if he was always in the whirlpool of struggle, making him too deeply involved in the whirlpool of struggle, which is not good."

This is a complete slander. Under the white terror, in the enemy's "cultural encirclement," Lu Xun made the most ruthless exposures and the most resolute struggles against all kinds of enemies. He called his works "command literature"—following the commands of the working people, peasants, and revolutionary pioneers. He treated his essays as daggers and spears, bravely throwing them at the chests of imperialists, feudalists, and their running dogs. The Kuomintang reactionaries listed Lu Xun on their blacklist several times, wanting to arrest him and kill him; the Kuomintang's hired writers hated him to the core, spreading rumors, slandering, and defaming him with the most despicable means. It was precisely Zhou Yang and his gang who, at that time, wore the cloak of revolution, did unspeakable deeds, fired cold shots, and shot dark arrows, attacking Lu Xun... All of this, doesn't it prove that Lu Xun was in the midst of fierce political struggles?

Zhou Yang slandered Lu Xun's path as one of "individual struggle" and "individual groping," denying the connection between Lu Xun and the Party's correct line. Zhou Yang put several "tightening spells" on the filming of "The Life of Lu Xun": he did not allow Lu Xun's connection with the Party's leaders and the revolutionary movement to be portrayed too closely, he did not allow Lu Xun to be portrayed as "too revolutionary," but only allowed the portrayal of Lu Xun's "own spirit of struggle" and his feelings of "loneliness" and "solitude," and so on.

This is equally malicious slander. Lu Xun had a blood-and-flesh connection with the Party. Comrade Xu Guangping wrote in "Memoirs of Lu Xun": "Although Lu Xun did not have the opportunity to meet our great leader Chairman Mao in person during his lifetime, he sincerely supported and accepted Chairman Mao's wise leadership." She also said: Lu Xun "said he was willing to be a 'soldier' in the revolutionary ranks led by the Party." In "A Reply to the Trotskyites," Lu Xun said: "Those who are truly fighting for the survival of the Chinese people today, I consider them comrades, and I am proud of it." It was under the influence and education of the Party, in the process of learning Marxism-Leninism, and in the struggle against various kinds of enemies, that Lu Xun became the "greatest and bravest flag-bearer of the new cultural army."

In his talks, Zhou Yang also maliciously distorted the struggle between the two lines of "National Defense Literature" and "Mass Literature of the National Revolutionary War," saying that it was "Lu Xun who was biased and deceived, who fell for the enemy's trick." He said, "The Kuomintang also knew that they could not openly arrest him, so they surrounded him, sowed discord, and tried to split him, which is also possible. This issue can be studied. At that time, we were young and hot-blooded, lacking experience. As long as someone challenged us, we would accept the challenge. If it were now, no matter how you challenge me, I would keep my cool and not respond, and there would be no trouble. This issue is very interesting." Zhou Yang is lying through his teeth here, turning this serious struggle into Lu Xun being "deceived" and his own "youthful impetuosity." He tries to use the method of stealing heaven and changing days to cover up the struggle between the two lines, and to put the hat of sectarianism on the dark arrow shot at Lu Xun, thereby openly resisting Chairman Mao's summary of the history of the cultural front in the 1930s.

Now is the time to thoroughly settle accounts with Zhou Yang's crimes of firing cold shots and shooting poisoned arrows over the past thirty years!

　　冷枪毒箭三十年
　　中国人民解放军海军某部　纪东
    一九六一年，正当牛鬼蛇神大刮“翻案风”的时候，周扬亲自出马，从三月十七日到十九日，在杭州同电影《鲁迅传》摄制创作人员作了三次谈话，接二连三地向鲁迅射出连珠毒箭。
    周扬明目张胆地反对毛主席对鲁迅的评价，竭力从政治上贬低鲁迅。他说：“鲁迅究竟不是政治活动家。”“没有参加到实际斗争中去”。他下令“不要把鲁迅写成与政治斗争太密切了，好象一直在斗争漩涡之中，把他过分陷在斗争漩涡之中，不好。”
    这是彻头彻尾的污蔑。鲁迅在白色恐怖之下，在敌人的文化“围剿”中，对形形色色的敌人作了最无情的揭露和最坚决的斗争。他把自己的作品，称之为“遵命文学”——遵工农劳苦大众和革命先驱之命。他把自己的杂文，当作匕首和投枪，勇猛地投向帝国主义、封建主义及其走狗的胸膛。国民党反动派几次把鲁迅列入黑名单，要抓他、杀他；国民党的御用文人对他恨之入骨，造谣、诽谤、中伤，使用了人间最卑鄙的手段。而正是周扬等一伙人，那时候披着革命的外衣，干着不可告人的勾当，放冷枪、射暗箭，围攻鲁迅……，所有这一切，难道不是有力地证明了鲁迅是处在激烈的政治斗争漩涡之中么？
    周扬污蔑鲁迅的道路是“个人奋斗”“个人摸索”的道路，否定鲁迅和党的正确路线的联系。周扬给《鲁迅传》的摄制，套上几个“紧箍咒”：不准把鲁迅与党的领导同志和革命运动的联系写得太密切，不准把鲁迅写得“过分革命化”，而只准写鲁迅“自己那种奋斗精神”和“孤独”“寂寞之感”等等。
    这同样是恶毒的诽谤。鲁迅和党有着血肉的联系。许广平同志在《鲁迅回忆录》中写道：“鲁迅生前虽然没有能够和我们伟大的领袖毛主席见面，但是他对毛主席的英明领导，是倾心拥护，诚恳接受的。”又说：鲁迅“自己说愿意在党领导的革命队伍中当一名‘小兵’。”鲁迅在《答托洛斯基派的信》中说：“那切切实实，足踏在地上，为着现在中国人的生存而流血奋斗者，我得引为同志，是自以为光荣的。”正是在党的影响和教育下，在学习马克思列宁主义的过程中，在跟形形色色的敌人的斗争中，鲁迅成了“文化新军的最伟大和最英勇的旗手”。
    周扬在谈话中，还把“国防文学”和“民族革命战争的大众文学”这两条路线的斗争，肆意歪曲为“是鲁迅偏听偏信受了骗，是中了敌人的反间计”。说什么：“国民党也知道，公开不能抓他，因而包围他，挑拨离间，进行分化也有这种可能。这个问题可以研究。我们当时是年少气盛，缺乏经验，只要来挑战，我就应战。如果是现在，任你们怎么来挑，我沉住气不理，也就没事了。这个问题很有意思。”周扬在这里漫天撒谎，把这场严肃的斗争，归之于鲁迅受“骗”，和自己的“年少气盛”。他企图用偷天换日的手法，把两条路线的斗争掩盖起来，并且把宗派主义的帽子绑在暗箭上射向鲁迅，从而公开抗拒毛主席关于三十年代文化战线斗争的历史总结。
    现在，是彻底清算周扬三十年来放冷枪、射毒箭的罪行的时候了！
