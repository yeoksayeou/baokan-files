The people of many counties and communes in Guizhou have held rallies and parades to express their enthusiastic support and response to the great call made in the communiqué.

After the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was transmitted to many counties and communes in the mountainous areas of Guizhou, people of all ethnic groups were overjoyed and held celebration meetings and parades. They unanimously expressed their enthusiastic support and response to the great call made in the communiqué.

In the cities of Anshun, Tongren, Xingyi, and the cities where the People's Committees of Qiannan and Qiandongnan Autonomous Regions are located, the number of people of all ethnic groups participating in the celebration meetings and parades increased from nearly ten thousand on the evening of the thirteenth to more than twenty thousand on the fourteenth. In the city of Zunyi, the site of the Zunyi Special District and the revolutionary historical city, in addition to extensive celebration activities, a propaganda team of more than a thousand people was organized to widely propagate the great significance of the communiqué in the streets. In the Bijie Special District, the masses participating in the parade continuously sang revolutionary songs such as "The Ship Sails on the Sea Depending on the Helmsman."

The people and cadres of all ethnic groups in Weining Yi, Hui, and Miao Autonomous County, a national advanced agricultural unit in the style of Dazhai, have held discussions in recent days, expressing their determination to thoroughly carry out the combat tasks proposed in the communiqué and to carry out the activities of learning from Dazhai, catching up with Dazhai, and surpassing Dazhai more extensively and deeply.

After listening to the broadcast of the communiqué, Yi Caixue, the director of the People's Armed Forces Department of Chengguan District, Qianxi County, and a second-class combat hero of the former Chinese People's Volunteers, said: "This is a great joy for the people of the whole country, and it is our highest program of action. We must resolutely carry it out. In the work of the people's armed forces, we must hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, be always prepared, and firmly grasp the guns in our hands. If the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys dare to impose war on our people, we will resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate them."
