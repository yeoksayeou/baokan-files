Great Call to Action, Radiant Beacon

When we heard the decision of the Party Central Committee on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we could not contain our excitement. We have a thousand words to say to Chairman Mao and ten thousand words to say to the Party Central Committee. We enthusiastically acclaim the wise decision of the Party Central Committee! Our beloved leader, Chairman Mao, teaches us: "The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China. The theoretical foundation guiding our thoughts is Marxism-Leninism." The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway is directly led by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have always been deeply concerned about the progress of the Cultural Revolution.

Now, the Party Central Committee has made a decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is another great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. This decision is a great call to the people of the entire nation, this decision is the highest program for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it is the beacon illuminating the path of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We, the members of the combat group, will resolutely carry out the wise decision of the Party Central Committee. We will strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the Cultural Revolution, carry forward the fearless revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, be bold, dare to make revolution, dare to struggle, dare to expose and criticize all ghosts and monsters, and all anti-Party, anti-socialist authorities and bourgeois "authorities," and engage in resolute struggle. We will wage the most resolute and thorough struggle against all old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits. We vow to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and we will not lay down our arms until we achieve complete victory!

    伟大的号召　光辉的灯塔
    当我们听到党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定后，抑制不住内心激动的感情，我们有千言万语要对毛主席说，我们有万语千言要对党中央讲。我们热烈欢呼党中央的英明决定！我们敬爱的领袖毛主席教导我们：“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。”当前进行的这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，是党中央和毛主席直接领导的，党中央和毛主席对文化大革命的进展一直十分关心。
    现在，党中央作出了关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定，这是毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利。这个决定是向全国人民发出的伟大号召，这个决定是无产阶级文化大革命的最高纲领，是照耀无产阶级文化大革命道路的灯塔。我们战斗小组同学坚决贯彻执行党中央的英明决定，要在文化大革命中，努力活学活用毛主席著作，发扬无产阶级无所畏惧的革命精神，“敢”字当头，敢于革命，敢于斗争，敢于揭露和批判一切牛鬼蛇神，和一切反党反社会主义的当权派、资产阶级的“权威”进行坚决斗争，和一切旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，作最坚决最彻底的斗争，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，不获全胜，决不收兵！
