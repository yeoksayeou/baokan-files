Captain Xu Yongjiang and the fleet commander, Deputy Brigade Commander Zhang Shourong, standing right behind him, sharply focused their gaze on the battlefield ahead. The brotherly fleet was fiercely attacking the enemy ship "Jianmen." The shells, glowing red, burst one after another on the enemy ship, and in the flash of the explosions, the deck structures of the enemy ship could already be discerned.

"Distance to 'Jianmen' is seven chains!" the radar operator reported. All the warships were already ready to fire. Zhang, the deputy brigade commander, was a leader who guided the troops to train in close combat and night combat with Mao Zedong Thought as the compass. He was well aware that the fleet was in an excellent standby state, awaiting his command. His sturdy hand raised the microphone, but the order he issued was not to fire, but to instruct the fleet to continue advancing and closing in on the enemy: "Our red tracer, enemy white tracer, we will go through the middle of the trajectory!"

Captain Xu Yongjiang understood the commander's intention, which was to get as close as possible to attack. "Increase speed!" he ordered the engineer. In fact, he had already given the engineer several orders to increase speed, and the engineer had already pushed the throttle lever to its maximum. The warship raised its bow high, and the waves, like mountains, quickly fell behind. The water columns from the enemy's artillery fire were also left far behind. The ship shook violently, tossing the people left and right. Yet, Captain Xu Yongjiang still felt the speed was not fast enough. His heart was filled with the surging waves of class hatred. When Xu Yongjiang was seven years old, the evil old society took the lives of his parents. Xu Yongjiang, who was not even as tall as a cow's belly, had to herd cattle and work as a young laborer for the landlord. The whip marks from the landlord's beatings were still on his body. Liberated, the Party trained him to become a soldier driving a warship. How could he not go to the battlefield with a heart full of class hatred! For a long time, he had studied Chairman Mao's works with great eagerness. "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are wiped out—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world towards the people's cause." This truth made him firmly establish the concept of being "always ready for battle." He engraved Chairman Mao's teachings in his heart and often told the soldiers: "We must hit the Kuomintang bandits and hurt the American imperialists! We must see in our eyes that there are still two-thirds of the people in the world who have not been liberated, and in our minds, we must have the world revolution!" Now was the time for him and the heroic fleet to practice their solemn oath.

"Distance to the enemy is × chains!" the radar operator reported. The fleet continued to rush into the fire network of the brotherly fleet attacking the enemy ship. Captain Xu Yongjiang ordered all combat positions to aim at the enemy ship. He heard Zhang, the deputy brigade commander, speaking in a low but clear voice: "Stay calm, keep the rudder steady, get a little closer!"

The enemy ship's intercepting fire fell far behind the fleet. The east was already bright, and the dawn outlined the huge silhouette of the "Jianmen" more and more clearly. The deck of the enemy ship was engulfed in thick smoke and flames...

"Distance to the enemy is × chains!" the radar operator continued to report. Xu Yongjiang's heart surged with the desire to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. He imagined our shells would be like bright, shining bayonets, stabbing into the enemy's heart one after another! "Should we get a little closer?" he asked Zhang, the deputy brigade commander. From Zhang's resolute gaze, he got an affirmative answer. He understood that the commander of the formation was encouraging him: "Be fierce, be ruthless, be accurate!" The commanding ship led the fleet, thunder and lightning, rushing towards the enemy ship...

"Distance to the enemy is × chains!" the radar operator reported. The distance was so close that the high bulwark of the "Jianmen" was like a black, dilapidated wall blocking the bow of the warship. Even the wheezing of the enemy ship's engine and the howling of the bandits could be heard.

The decisive moment had arrived!

Zhang, the deputy brigade commander, and Captain Xu exchanged a swift glance and calmly ordered into the microphone: "Fire!"

Before people could see clearly how our fleet's thunderous fire suddenly met on the enemy ship, there were several deafening explosions, and the surging waves instantly swallowed the "Jianmen."

    逼近轰击“剑门号”
    荣立二等功的水手长　阎培林
    许永江艇长和紧靠他身后站着的编队指挥员张寿瀛副大队长，目光锐利地紧盯着前方战区。兄弟艇队正在猛烈轰击敌舰“剑门号”，炮弹闪着红光一排排在敌舰上开花爆炸，借着炮弹爆炸时的闪光，已经可以辨别出敌舰的舱面建筑。
      “距离‘剑门号’七链！”雷达手报告。所有战艇早就作好射击准备了。张副大队长，是一个以毛泽东思想为指针率领部队认真训练近战、夜战本领的指挥员。他很清楚艇队已经处于良好的待机状态，只待他一声令下。他粗壮的手擎起了报话机话筒，但是他下达的不是射击命令，而是指示艇队继续逼近接敌的航向：“我红色曳光弹，敌白色曳光弹，我们从弹道中间穿进去！”
    许永江艇长理解首长的意图，是要最大限度靠上去打。“加速！”他命令轮机长。其实，他早就给轮机长下了好几次加速的命令了，轮机长也早就把伡钟操纵杆推到最高速度。战艇高高昂起艇首，山一样的浪翼飞快落到后面去，敌人炮火炸起的水柱也被远远抛到了后面，艇体猛烈颠簸，把人左右抛掷着。可是许永江艇长还感到速度不够快，他的心被沸腾的阶级仇恨的波涛涨满了。许永江七岁的时候，万恶的旧社会夺去了他父母的生命。还没有牛肚子高的许永江就给地主放牛，当小长工，他身上至今还留着地主毒打的鞭痕。解放了，党把他培养成驾驶战艇的人民战士，他怎能不带着满腔阶级仇恨上战场呢！长期以来，他如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作。“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑”。这真理，使他牢牢树立了“永远是战斗队”的战备观念。他把毛主席的教导铭刻在心里，时常对战士们说：“我们要打在蒋匪身上，痛在美帝心上！我们眼睛里要看到世界上还有三分之二没有得到解放的人民，思想上要有世界革命！”眼下，正是他和英雄艇队实践庄严誓言的时候了。
      “距敌×链！”雷达手报告。艇队继续向兄弟艇队攻击敌舰的火网下疾速冲击。许永江艇长命令各战位瞄准敌舰。他耳旁响起了张副大队长低低的但是清晰的声音：“沉着，把稳舵向，再近一点！”
    敌舰拦截炮火远远落到艇队后面去了。东方已经发白，曙光把“剑门号”庞大的轮廓衬得愈来愈清楚，敌舰舱面上漫卷着浓烟火舌……
      “距敌×链！”雷达手继续报告。许永江的心头升起和敌人面对面肉搏的愿望。他想象我们的炮弹将要象一把把明晃晃、亮闪闪的刺刀，一下下都戳入敌人的心窝！“是不是再近一点？”他请示张副大队长。从张副大队长坚毅的目光里，他得到了肯定的回答，他懂得编队首长在鼓励他：“要猛、要狠、要准！”指挥艇率领艇队雷鸣闪电般向敌舰跟前冲去……。
      “距敌×链！”雷达手报告。距离是这样近，“剑门号”高高的舷墙，象一堵黑糊糊的破烂照壁拦在战艇艇首，连敌舰轮机哮喘病一样的低喘和匪兵鬼哭狼嚎的惊叫，都听得见。
    决战的时刻到了！
    张副大队长和许艇长的目光迅速交互一闪，沉静地对着话筒命令：“射击！”
    人们还没有来得及看清楚我艇队滚雷一般的炮火，怎样猛然在敌舰上“会师”，只听得天崩地裂的几声巨响，汹涌的波涛顷刻间吞没了“剑门号”。
