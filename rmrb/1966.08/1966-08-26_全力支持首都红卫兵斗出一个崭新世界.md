Dear Red Guards of the Capital:

Greetings!

In recent days, your series of revolutionary actions and rebellious news from Beijing have reached the remote Yellow River Plateau and our team building the new railway line. We are all inspired, drumming and cheering, spreading the word. Many street names and shop names without political significance have been changed, many black painting shops and oddly dressed stores have been smashed by you, and revisionist goods have been thrown into the trash. It is truly heartening and wonderful! We workers have long despised those ghostly tricks and all the old things; we have long been dissatisfied with them. What you are doing is exactly representing the wishes of us, the broad masses of workers. We firmly and wholeheartedly support your rebellious actions!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Communist Party of China is the core leadership of the entire Chinese people. Without such a core, the cause of socialism cannot be victorious." To achieve victory in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must closely unite around the Party Central Committee, follow Chairman Mao's words: "Be prepared to sacrifice your life, dare to pull the emperor off his horse." Study and apply the Sixteen Points, dare to tread the path where no one has ever trodden. With the great thought of Mao Zedong as our spiritual atomic bomb, we fear nothing, dare to fight against heaven, earth, and man, and against erroneous thoughts. We must criticize the old world, uproot the roots of revisionism, rebel, and fight for a brand new world, so that the proletarian iron mountain will forever remain young. This is the ideal of the working class, and it is also our sincere hope for you—the great, glorious Red Guards!

Dear Red Guard fighters! In this great upheaval, the situation is tortuous and complex. We must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings, dare to struggle, and also be good at struggling. If you encounter any difficulties, tell us without reservation, and we workers will wholeheartedly and resolutely support you! Whatever you need, we will treat it as the top priority to do it well, and if conditions are not sufficient, we will create the conditions to do it well, even if it means climbing mountains of knives and crossing seas of fire. Currently, we must seriously implement the spirit of the Sixteen Points, seize the revolution and promote production, strive for high achievements and create miracles in the construction of the new railway line, and strive to achieve the Third Five-Year Plan. Let us join hands and advance bravely together along the revolutionary course opened by Chairman Mao!

Our resolve is: to rebel, to overthrow the bourgeois "authorities," to uproot the roots of revisionism, and to sweep away all harmful elements!

We wish the Red Guards greater victories!

Finally, let us shout:

Carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

Long live our most, most respected great leader Chairman Mao!

    全力支持首都红卫兵斗出一个崭新世界亲爱的首都红卫兵们：
    您们好！
    近几天里，您们一系列的革命行动和造反的好消息，从北京传到边远的黄土高原，传到了我们——新线铁路建设的队伍里，我们无不为之振奋，敲锣打鼓，奔走相告。许多毫无政治意义的街道商店名称改换了，许多黑画店、奇装怪服店被您们砸烂了，修正主义的货色被扫入垃圾箱了。真是大快人心，好得很！我们工人早就唾弃那些鬼怪名堂，那些所有的旧东西，我们早就看不顺眼，您们这样做正是代表了我们广大工人的心愿，我们坚决全力支持您们的造反行为！
    毛主席教导我们说：“中国共产党是全中国人民的领导核心。没有这样一个核心，社会主义事业就不能胜利。”我们要取得这次文化大革命的胜利，就必须紧紧团结在党中央的周围，听毛主席的话：“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马。”学习、运用十六条，敢于走前人没有走过的路。我们有伟大的毛泽东思想这个精神原子弹，我们就什么也不怕，敢与天斗，与地斗，与人斗，与错误思想斗，要批判旧世界，要铲除修正主义的根子，要造反，要斗出一个崭新的世界来，使无产阶级铁打的江山，永葆青春。这是我们工人阶级的理想，也是我们对于您们——伟大光荣的红卫兵们的殷切希望！
    最亲爱的红卫兵战士们！在这次翻天覆地的大革命中，情况是曲折、复杂的。我们一定要牢记毛主席的教导，要敢于斗争，同时也要善于斗争。您们要是碰到什么困难，就毫无保留地告诉给我们，我们工人一定全力以赴，最坚决地支持您们！凡是您们的需要，我们就把它当成压倒一切的中心工作去做，有条件的要做好，没有条件的，创造条件也要做好，上刀山下火海也在所不惜。目前，我们要认真贯彻十六条精神，抓革命，促生产，在新线铁路建设中，攀高峰，创奇迹，为实现第三个五年计划而努力奋斗。让我们携起手来，沿着毛主席开辟的革命航道，共同奋勇前进！
    我们的决心是：要造反，要斗倒资产阶级“权威”，要挖掉修正主义的根子，要横扫一切害人虫！
    祝红卫兵们再接再厉，夺取更大胜利！
    最后让我们高呼：
    把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
        铁道部三局五处三队革命工人
                陈祖善等一百七十六人
