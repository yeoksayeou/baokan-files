The Liberation Army of South Vietnam has recently won several brilliant annihilation battles, inflicting heavy losses on the U.S. and puppet forces. In the provinces of Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh, and Quang Nam, the liberation armed forces have launched continuous attacks on the enemy, achieving great victories.

In Quang Ngai Province, the liberation armed forces launched a fierce attack on the enemy stronghold at Oa Nuoc in Phuong My Commune, Phuong My District, from the night of July 14 to the early morning of July 15. They annihilated an entire U.S. Marine Corps battalion and nearly two companies of puppet troops, and destroyed a large amount of weapons.

The Oa Nuoc stronghold is located eight kilometers south of the U.S. military base at Chu Lai and is an important outpost of the base. A U.S. Marine Corps battalion occupied three hills, with strong defenses.

At half past midnight on July 14, the liberation armed forces cleverly and bravely crossed the enemy's defensive line and launched a full-scale attack on the enemy troops in the stronghold. As soon as the battle began, the liberation armed forces destroyed the enemy's defensive system, blew up seven bunkers, destroyed one armored vehicle, and quickly captured the three hills. They engaged in close combat with the enemy using grenades, bayonets, and rifle butts, cutting the enemy into small groups and annihilating them.

After fifty minutes of fighting, the liberation armed forces completely occupied the position, annihilating the entire U.S. invading battalion and nearly two companies of puppet troops stationed in the stronghold. They destroyed the enemy's artillery positions, destroyed nine cannons of various calibers, two military trucks, eight telephones, and one radio transceiver.

According to a report from the Liberation Communication Agency of South Vietnam, the liberation armed forces in Gia Dinh Province recently launched two attacks on the U.S. 25th Infantry Division's 2nd Brigade stationed in Go Vap District, annihilating 600 U.S. troops and destroying sixty tanks and armored vehicles.

The liberation armed forces launched the first attack at around 6:30 PM on July 26, using heavy mortar fire to bombard the enemy camp. The U.S. invaders were caught off guard and hastily called in aircraft to bomb and strafe in the dark. However, the brave liberation soldiers continued to advance towards the enemy positions, killing the enemy.

At around 4:30 AM on July 27, the liberation armed forces launched a second attack on the disoriented U.S. troops, throwing the enemy into chaos.

The two attacks on the U.S. 25th Infantry Division were the heaviest blows it had ever suffered.

According to a report from Westac, the liberation armed forces in South Vietnam have launched fierce attacks on the U.S. invading forces near Pleiku in the Central Highlands in the past two days, causing casualties and losses to the enemy.

According to reports from Western news agencies, at dawn on July 31, the liberation armed forces launched heavy mortar and automatic weapon attacks on the troops of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division's 3rd Brigade in an area 32 kilometers south of Pleiku. The enemy positions were in chaos. Around 5:30 AM, the liberation armed forces began shelling the reinforcements from the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division with mortars. Two companies of U.S. troops were hit. Even the U.S. military spokesman admitted that the liberation armed forces "fired ninety shells like rain on the cavalry soldiers," causing casualties. In the battle on July 31, the liberation armed forces wounded a U.S. company commander. The fighting intensified on August 1. Four companies of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division were again attacked.

According to another report, the liberation armed forces ambushed a U.S. military convoy consisting of twenty-four trucks on the road from Da Nang to Hue on August 1, and ambushed another enemy convoy consisting of more than ten trucks near Thu Duc, southeast of Saigon, causing losses and casualties to the enemy.
