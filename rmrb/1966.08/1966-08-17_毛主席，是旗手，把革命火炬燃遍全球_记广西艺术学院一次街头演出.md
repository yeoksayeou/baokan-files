On the evening of the 14th, the widest square in Nanning, the Sun Square, was filled with the sound of drums and gongs. The revolutionary students of Guangxi Arts Academy began their artistic performance to the tune of "The East is Red."

These young people from various ethnic groups, coming from Friendship Pass, Red Water River, and the Yao and Zhuang villages, had never had anyone in their families attend school before. Some had begged for food door to door with their parents in the old society, some were cowherds, and some were firewood gatherers. It was the Party and Chairman Mao who saved them from their miserable lives and nurtured them into educated individuals. They have the deepest class sentiments for the Party and Chairman Mao and always follow Chairman Mao's words. They sang:

"Stars and the moon together,
Fish and water together,
Melons and vines together,
Chairman Mao is always with us!"

"The moon in the sky with stars,
Chairman Mao is so close to our Zhuang family,
We offer Zhuang brocade,
We offer our hearts..."

"Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao,
Thousands of words cannot express
The boundless love, respect, and admiration
Of all ethnic peoples for you!"

Chairman Mao's meeting with the revolutionary masses of the capital greatly inspired the revolutionary teachers and students. They said: Chairman Mao's meeting with the revolutionary masses of the capital is a meeting with all revolutionary masses of all ethnic groups in China. Chairman Mao shaking hands with the revolutionary masses of the capital is shaking hands with each of us. The graduating class of this academy, the "Revolutionary Vanguard" combat group, created a poem titled "Chairman Mao Tightly Holds Our Hands." They recited:

"Chairman Mao, you are the flag-bearer,
Chairman Mao, you are the helmsman.
Your hands—
Spread Marxism-Leninism,
Ignite the torch of revolution across the globe.
Workers who shake your hand,
Will make steel flow like water;
Peasants who shake your hand,
Will vow to achieve bumper harvests of grain and cotton;
Soldiers who shake your hand,
Will train to be tough and strong;
Students who shake your hand,
Will have the energy to fight in the struggle, criticism, and reform.
Iron fists smash the old world,
Power comes from Chairman Mao's hands!"

How many hearts were beating wildly. How many pairs of excited eyes were shining with tears. The audience and the performers all became excited. "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" The cheers and applause echoed through the sky in rhythm.

　　毛主席，是旗手，把革命火炬燃遍全球
　　——记广西艺术学院一次街头演出
    十四日晚上，南宁市最宽敞的朝阳广场上，锣鼓喧天，广西艺术学院革命学生的文艺演出，在《东方红》乐曲声中开始了。
    这些来自友谊关下、红水河边、瑶山壮寨的各族青年，有的祖祖辈辈没有一个人进过学校大门，有的在旧社会跟着爹妈沿门乞讨，有的是放牛娃，有的是打柴妹。是党，是毛主席，把他们从苦海里搭救出来，把他们培养成人。他们对党和毛主席有最深厚的阶级感情，他们最听毛主席的话。他们唱道：
    “星星和月亮在一起，
    鱼儿和水在一起，
    瓜儿和藤在一起，
    毛主席永远和我们在一起！”
    “天上的月亮带星星，
    毛主席和咱壮家亲又亲，
    献上一幅幅的壮锦啊，
    献上壮家的一片心……”
    “毛主席啊毛主席，
    千言万语道不尽各族人民
    对你无限热爱无限敬仰
    无限崇拜的心情！”
    毛主席会见首都革命群众，极大地鼓舞了革命师生。他们说：毛主席会见首都革命群众，就是会见了全中国各族革命群众，毛主席和首都革命群众握手，就是和我们每个人握手。这个学院的毕业班，“革命尖兵”战斗小组的同学，创作了一首题为《毛主席紧紧握住我们的手》的诗歌。他们朗诵道：
    “毛主席，是旗手，
    毛主席，是舵手。
    你的这双手——
    把马克思列宁主义传播，
    把革命火炬燃遍全球。
    工人握过你的手，
    要叫钢水滚滚流；
    农民握过你的手，
    誓夺粮棉大丰收；
    战士握过你的手，
    练就一身硬骨头；
    学生握过你的手，
    一斗二批三改有劲头。
    铁拳砸碎旧世界，
    力量来自毛主席的手！”
    多少颗火热的心在剧烈地跳动。多少双激动的眼睛闪烁着泪花。观众和演员，一起沸腾起来。“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”的欢呼声和掌声，有节奏地响彻云霄。
