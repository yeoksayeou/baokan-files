	Hail the Great Leader in Military Uniform

	Chairman Mao has donned his military uniform,
	Standing tall on the Tiananmen Gate Tower.
	Looking up at our beloved leader,
	A warm current surges into the hearts of the soldiers.

	Thirty-nine years ago, the leader in his military uniform,
	Led the Autumn Harvest Uprising to the mountains of Jinggang,
	Personally opened the first red base,
	Personally established the first workers' and peasants' armed forces.

	In the years of arduous struggle,
	The leader in his military uniform,
	Led us across snow-capped mountains and grasslands,
	Overcame countless storms and waves.

	In the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation,
	The leader in his military uniform,
	Led us to defeat the Japanese invaders and the American Kuomintang bandits,
	And welcomed the Five-Star Red Flag flying high...

	Beloved Chairman Mao,
	You are always by our side;
	Beloved Chairman Mao,
	You guide us to victory every day.

	Now the leader has donned his military uniform again,
	Standing tall on the majestic Tiananmen Gate Tower,
	Like a radiant sun, illuminating the path of the world's revolutionary people.

	Seeing the leader in his military uniform,
	Our fighting spirit is stronger,
	We vow to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end,
	And sweep away all the ghosts and monsters.

	Chairman Mao has donned his military uniform,
	The honor of revolutionary soldiers is unparalleled,
	The leader's care and the commander's trust,
	Add boundless strength to the soldiers.

	We share our heartfelt words with the Party,
	We sing our heartfelt songs to the Party:
	We will always follow Chairman Mao,
	Our red hearts will always be loyal to the Party.

	We will be heroes for the revolution,
	Forever defending the red sun in our hearts.

	A pen: Sweep away all the ghosts and monsters in the world!
	A gun: Annihilate all the tigers and wolves in the world!

	Communications Troops, Wang Xiong, Yu Guanglie

　　欢呼伟大领袖穿军装
　　毛主席穿上了军装，
　　挺立在天安门城楼上。
　　仰望敬爱的领袖，
　　一股暖流涌进战士的心房。
　　三十九年前，领袖穿着军装，
　　率领秋收起义队伍奔向井冈山上，
　　亲手开辟了第一个红色根据地，
　　亲手创建了第一支工农武装。
　　在艰苦斗争的岁月里，
　　领袖穿着军装，
　　带领我们跨过雪山草地，
　　踏平了多少狂涛恶浪。
　　在抗日战争和解放战争中，
　　领袖穿着军装，
　　带领我们打败了日寇和美蒋匪帮，
　　迎来五星红旗高高飘扬……
　　敬爱的毛主席，
　　您时刻都在我们身旁；
　　敬爱的毛主席，
　　您天天指挥我们打胜仗。
　　如今领袖又穿上了军装，
　　挺立在雄伟的天安门城楼上，
　　像一轮红日光芒四射，
　　把世界人民革命的前程照得通明。
　　望着领袖穿军装，
　　咱战斗的意志更坚强，
　　誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，
　　定把一切牛鬼蛇神统统扫光。
　　毛主席穿上了军装，
　　革命战士无上荣光，
　　领袖的关怀，统帅的信赖，
　　更给战士增添了无穷的力量。
　　咱知心的话儿对党说，
　　咱贴心的歌儿对党唱：
　　咱永远紧跟毛主席，
　　咱红心永远忠于党。
　　咱要为革命当闯将，
　　永远捍卫心中红太阳。
　　一支笔：扫尽人间鬼怪！
　　一杆枪：灭绝世界上一切虎狼！
