On the third anniversary of Chairman Mao's call for the people of the world to unite and oppose American imperialism's racial discrimination and support the struggle of American blacks against racial discrimination, the people of Congo (Brazzaville) angrily condemn the Johnson administration's continued brutal suppression of American blacks. They believe that Chairman Mao's statement made three years ago in support of the struggle of American blacks has extremely great significance.

A Congolese trade union leader told a Xinhua News Agency correspondent: "The fact that the struggle of American blacks against the brutal suppression of American imperialists has surged in the past three years fully proves that Chairman Mao's famous statement has greatly inspired the struggle of American blacks and all oppressed people in the world, and has pointed out a clear direction for their struggle."

A youth leader said: "Chairman Mao pointed out in his statement the intrinsic connection between the reactionary policies of the U.S. government at home and its aggressive policies abroad. In the past three years, the U.S. has intensified its aggression and subversive activities in Africa, particularly in Congo (Brazzaville) and Congo (Leopoldville). In fact, this is an extension of its policy of suppressing blacks at home."

A leader of the seventh branch of the National Revolutionary Movement of Congo (Brazzaville) said: "Even our children do not like to hear the name 'America.' To us, this name means all kinds of crimes and bad things, meaning the suppression of blacks in Chicago, the massacre in Vietnam, and the aggression and subversion in Africa."

The weekly *L'Indépendant*, published on August 6, hailed the struggle of American blacks using revolutionary violence to resist the reactionary ruling clique in the U.S. The magazine said that in the U.S., the struggle of blacks has entered the stage of violent self-defense.

The people of Congo (Brazzaville) know that the ancestors of most American blacks were transported from West Africa and Central Africa by colonialists from the 16th to the 19th centuries. At that time, from Brazzaville to the port of Cape Town, there was a sinister 'slave road.' On this road, countless black slaves, with chains around their necks, were driven out from the interior of Congo (Brazzaville) and neighboring countries and shipped to America or Latin America. Even now, the bitter history of the slave trade handed down by ancestors is still circulating in the countryside, and hatred is deeply buried in people's hearts.

A Congolese teacher told a Xinhua News Agency correspondent that the Congolese people highly value Chairman Mao's famous proposition that the evil system of colonialism and imperialism, which flourished with the enslavement and trafficking of blacks, will also come to an end with the complete liberation of the black race. He said that the centuries-long large-scale resistance of African people and the uprisings of black slaves in North and South America have finally shaken the slave-trading system of the colonialists. He expressed his belief that the current struggle of American blacks, with the resolute support of all oppressed people in the world, will ultimately bury the imperialist system in the surging waves of the people's struggle.

    刚果（布）公众赞扬毛主席支持美国黑人斗争的声明
    毛主席给被压迫人民指明了斗争方向
    新华社布拉柴维尔八日电　在毛主席呼吁世界人民联合起来反对美国帝国主义的种族歧视、支持美国黑人反对种族歧视的斗争的声明发表三周年的时候，刚果（布）人民愤怒谴责约翰逊政府继续残暴镇压美国黑人的罪行。他们认为毛主席三年前发表的支持美国黑人斗争的声明具有极为重大的意义。
    一位刚果工会领袖对新华社记者说：美国黑人过去三年中反对美帝国主义者残暴镇压的斗争的高涨这个事实完全证明，毛主席的著名声明给予美国黑人和全世界被压迫人民的斗争以极大的鼓舞，并给他们的斗争指出了明确的方向。
    一位青年领袖说：毛主席在他的声明中指出了美国政府在国内的反动政策和在国外的侵略政策之间的内在联系。美国过去三年，在非洲，特别是在刚果（布）和刚果（利）加紧侵略和颠覆活动，实际上是它的在国内镇压黑人政策的延伸。
    刚果（布）全国革命运动青年组织第七支部的一位领导人说：“甚至我们的儿童也不喜欢听到‘美国’这个名字。对我们来说，这个名字意味着各种罪行和一切坏事，意味着对芝加哥黑人的镇压，在越南的屠杀，在非洲的侵略和颠覆。”
    八月六日出版的《独立》周刊欢呼美国黑人用革命暴力反抗美国反动统治集团的斗争。这家周刊说，在美国，黑人的斗争进入了暴力自卫斗争的阶段。
    刚果（布）人民都知道，大多数美国黑人的祖先是十六世纪到十九世纪殖民主义者从西非和中非运去的。当时，从布拉柴维尔到黑角海港，是一条罪恶的“商队之路”，在这条路上，无数黑人奴隶的脖子上套着锁链，被从刚果（布）及附近国家的内地赶出来，用船只运往美国或拉丁美洲。直到现在，祖先传下来的关于奴隶买卖的苦难的历史还在农村中流传着，仇恨深深地埋在人们的心底。
    一位刚果教师对新华社记者说，刚果人民高度评价毛主席关于万恶的殖民主义、帝国主义制度是随着奴役和贩卖黑人而兴盛起来的，它也必将随着黑色人种的彻底解放而告终的著名论断。他说，非洲人民几世纪的大规模反抗以及中美和南美黑人奴隶的暴动终于动摇了殖民主义者的奴隶买卖制度。他表示相信，目前美国黑人的斗争得到全世界被压迫人民的坚决支持，世界人民斗争的怒浪最后必将埋葬帝国主义制度。
