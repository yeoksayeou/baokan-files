At the banquet welcoming Zambian Vice President Kamanaga, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice President Kamanaga delivered speeches.

New China News Agency, August 19th: Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the banquet welcoming the delegation of the Republic of Zambia headed by Vice President Ruben Chitandika Kamanaga is as follows:

Honorable Vice President Ruben Chitandika Kamanaga, Honorable Minister of Foreign Affairs Simon Mwansa Kapwepwe and his wife, honorable Zambian guests, friends, and comrades:

We are very pleased to be able to host here the entire delegation of the Republic of Zambia, led by Vice President Kamanaga. You have flown across the ocean and traveled thousands of miles to bring the precious friendship of the Zambian people to the Chinese people. On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, and in the name of Vice Chairman Dong Biwu and myself, I express my heartfelt thanks and warm welcome to all the Zambian guests.

Zambia is a country with a long history and an ancient culture. The hardworking and brave Zambian people have waged a long and heroic struggle against the rule and oppression of imperialism and colonialism, finally shattering the colonial shackles of the "Central African Federation" in 1964 and winning national independence. The victory of the Zambian people has been a great inspiration to the peoples of Central and Southern Africa in their struggle for independence and freedom.

Since independence, under the leadership of President Kaunda and the Zambian government, Zambia has made unremitting efforts to eliminate colonial influences, consolidate national independence, develop the national economy and culture, and has achieved remarkable results. In international affairs, the Republic of Zambia has consistently pursued a non-aligned foreign policy, opposed imperialism and old and new colonialism, and supported the national independence movements of the peoples of Africa. We sincerely wish that the Republic of Zambia will continue to achieve greater success on the path of independent development.

Honorable guests! We are concerned to note that Zambia is currently facing interference and threats from the imperialist and colonial regimes of Britain, America, and their puppet, the colonial government of Southern Rhodesia. The criminal collusion between British, American imperialism, and the Smith colonial regime in Southern Rhodesia is not only a savage attack on the people of Zimbabwe but also a serious threat to the people of Zambia and the peoples of Central and Southern Africa, and a blatant provocation to the peoples of Africa. The government and people of Zambia are waging a serious struggle to smash the imperialist plots and support the struggle of the brotherly people of Zimbabwe for independence. The Chinese people have always stood firmly with the people of Zambia, Zimbabwe, and the peoples of Africa in the struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism, and will carry this struggle through to the end.

At present, the national independence movement in Africa is entering a new stage of development. Imperialism and old and new colonialism, led by the United States, are extremely fearful of this situation. They are using brutal repression, savage attacks, and bribery and deception to try to destroy and disintegrate the struggle of the African peoples for national independence and to maintain their domination over Africa. However, their actions will not only fail to save colonialism from its inevitable demise but will instead further promote the awakening of the African peoples and strengthen their anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle. Africa belongs to the African peoples, and Africa must become an Africa free from imperialism and old and new colonialism.

Friends and comrades! The struggles of the peoples of Asia and Africa have always been mutually supportive and inspiring. The struggle of the African peoples against imperialism and old and new colonialism has strongly supported the peoples of Asia. The struggle of the peoples of Asia against the aggressive and war policies of imperialism led by the United States has strongly supported the peoples of Africa. In the current global anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle, the heroic people of Vietnam are at the forefront. They are not only fighting for their own independence and dignity but also for all peoples and nations suffering from imperialist aggression, interference, control, and oppression. The Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation is tying down and striking the greatest forces of the United States, which is the greatest support for the peoples of all countries. Therefore, the just struggle of the Vietnamese people has gained increasingly widespread sympathy, respect, and support from the peoples of the world. The Chinese government and people fully support Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to the Entire Nation," resolutely support the Vietnamese people in fighting to the end until they achieve final victory in their war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation.

Friends and comrades! The Chinese people and the peoples of Africa are comrades-in-arms who share the same breath and destiny in the common struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism. China has always adhered to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in developing friendly and cooperative relations with Asian and African countries. We have always respected the sovereignty of all countries, advocated equality among large and small countries, and resolutely opposed interference in the internal affairs of other countries. We have always advocated that Asian and African countries conduct economic cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, promote the common prosperity of national economies on the basis of self-reliance, and our stance and attitude on this will never change and will stand the test of time. We are confident that the friendly and cooperative relations between China and African countries will continue to develop.

China and Zambia have a shared historical experience. In the common struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism, the peoples of the two countries have always sympathized with and supported each other. In the past two years, our friendly and cooperative relations have developed further. The Zambian government has consistently opposed the imperialist plot to create "two Chinas" and supported the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations. For this, we express our thanks. In the cause of the Zambian people in opposing imperialist aggression, safeguarding national independence, and building their own country, the Chinese people will always be your reliable friends. I believe that the Zambian guests' friendly visit to our country this time will make a positive contribution to further strengthening the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries, enhancing the understanding and friendship between our peoples, and strengthening the unity of the peoples of Asia and Africa. I sincerely wish that your visit will be a complete success.

Now, I propose a toast:

To the prosperity and happiness of the people of the Republic of Zambia,
To the friendship between the peoples of China and Zambia,
To the unity of Asia and Africa and world peace,
To the health of President Kenneth Kaunda,
To the health of Vice President Kamanaga,
To the health of Foreign Minister Kapwepwe and his wife,
To the health of the entire delegation of the Zambian government,
To the health of the diplomatic envoys and their wives,
To the health of all friends and comrades present,

Cheers!

New China News Agency, August 19th: The speech by Vice President Ruben Chitandika Kamanaga of the Republic of Zambia at the welcoming banquet hosted by Vice Chairman Dong Biwu and Premier Zhou Enlai is as follows:

Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China, Premier, Your Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen:

I am very pleased to have the opportunity to come to your great capital, Beijing, and to speak to you this evening.

First, I would like to convey the very warm greetings and good wishes of President Kaunda, his government, and the entire people of the Republic of Zambia.

Secondly, I would like to take this opportunity to express my personal deep gratitude and the heartfelt thanks of our delegation for the grand welcome you have given us. Vice Chairman, the joyful smiles of the hundreds of thousands of people in Guangzhou and this great city cannot but convince even the most skeptical that our two peoples are now good friends and are prepared to be good friends forever. Zambia is determined to strengthen these bonds of friendship.

Your Excellency, I would like to formally inform you, your government, and your people that the day is not far off when Zambia will establish an embassy in your great city. This will greatly contribute to achieving the desired goal of better mutual understanding and better knowledge of each other's problems.

Your Excellency, you are well aware of the purpose of our visit. However, if you will permit me to repeat, I would like to briefly mention it. As a friendly delegation, we feel that we should use the opportunity of our being here to discuss international affairs, general issues of peace, the urgency of easing world tensions, and the problem of decolonization, as well as the problem of improving the conditions of our people at home.

The people of Zambia value the friendship of the peoples of the world. The peoples of the world may be geographically and politically divided into different countries, but they share a common humanity. Their material and spiritual needs are the same, although they may choose different ways to best satisfy these needs. It is often said that people are more alike in their problems than in their beliefs. We Zambians believe that common problems are a sufficient basis for acknowledging a common humanity.

First, Zambia recognizes your efforts for international peace. When you exploded your first atomic bomb, you proposed controlling the use of such weapons and devices. This is an important statement because the world is well aware that in the next ten years, the invention, possession, and use of nuclear weapons will not be limited to the few nuclear powers of today. Secondly, Your Excellency, your attitude towards the United Nations shows your willingness to contribute to international peace and stability. In this regard, I wish to reiterate that my country supports your desire to enter the United Nations. Thirdly, my country has noted your unceasing efforts to accelerate decolonization.

In the fields of economic development and culture, both our countries have suffered naked exploitation by outsiders. The problems you have faced and continue to face in national construction are also before us. Therefore, there is room for the exchange of experience, and we believe we can benefit from the part of the road you have already traveled in construction. You have already contributed to the establishment of our first national university. For this, we sincerely thank Chairman Mao Zedong, your government, and people.

Your Excellency, we hope that our discussions will lead to an increase in trade, economic cooperation, and cultural exchange.

Your Excellency, finally, I wish to once again thank you for the most magnificent welcome and express that we look forward to our stay in the People's Republic of China.

I propose a toast to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong and the people of the People's Republic of China!

　　在欢迎赞比亚副总统卡曼加的宴会上
　　周恩来总理和卡曼加副总统的讲话
    新华社十九日讯　周恩来总理在欢迎赞比亚共和国副总统鲁本·奇坦迪卡·卡曼加宴会上的讲话，全文如下：尊敬的鲁本·奇坦迪卡·卡曼加副总统阁下，尊敬的西蒙·姆旺萨·卡普韦普韦外长阁下和夫人，尊敬的赞比亚贵宾们，朋友们，同志们：
    我们十分高兴，能够在这里接待以卡曼加副总统为首的赞比亚共和国政府代表团全体贵宾们。你们飞越重洋，不远万里而来，给中国人民带来了赞比亚人民的珍贵友谊。我代表中国政府和中国人民，并且以董必武副主席和我个人的名义，向赞比亚全体贵宾们，表示衷心的感谢和热烈的欢迎。
    赞比亚是一个历史悠久、具有古老文化的国家。勤劳、勇敢的赞比亚人民，对帝国主义和殖民主义的统治和压迫，进行了长期的英勇的斗争，终于在一九六四年粉碎了“中非联邦”的殖民枷锁，赢得了民族独立。赞比亚人民的胜利，对中、南非各国人民争取独立和自由的斗争，是一个很大的鼓舞。
    独立以来，赞比亚在卡翁达总统和赞比亚政府的领导下，为清除殖民势力、巩固民族独立、发展民族经济和民族文化，进行了不懈的努力，取得了显著的成就。在国际事务中，赞比亚共和国坚持奉行不结盟的对外政策，反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义，支持非洲各国人民的民族独立运动。我们衷心地祝愿，赞比亚共和国在独立发展的道路上，不断取得更大的成就。
    尊敬的贵宾们！我们关切地注意到，现在赞比亚正面临着英、美帝国主义和他们的傀儡南罗得西亚殖民当局的干涉和威胁。英、美帝国主义和南罗史密斯殖民政权的罪恶勾结，不仅是对津巴布韦人民的猖狂进攻，也是对赞比亚人民和中、南非各国人民的严重威胁，是对非洲各国人民的露骨挑衅。赞比亚政府和人民，正为粉碎帝国主义的阴谋，支持兄弟的津巴布韦人民争取独立，而进行着严重的斗争。中国人民始终不渝地同赞比亚人民、津巴布韦人民和非洲各国人民站在一起，把反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争进行到底。
    目前，非洲的民族独立运动正在进入一个新的发展阶段。以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义，对这种形势感到十分恐惧。他们采取残酷镇压、疯狂进攻和收买欺骗种种手段，妄图破坏和瓦解非洲人民争取和维护民族独立的斗争，以便继续奴役非洲人民。但是，他们这样做，不但不能挽救殖民主义必然要被消灭的命运，相反，只能更加促进非洲人民的民族觉醒，加强非洲人民的反帝革命斗争。非洲是非洲人民的非洲，非洲一定要成为一个没有帝国主义和新老殖民主义的非洲。
    朋友们，同志们！亚非各国人民的斗争从来是互相支持，互相鼓舞的。非洲人民反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争，有力地支援着亚洲人民。亚洲人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策的斗争，有力地支援着非洲人民。在当前全世界人民反帝革命斗争中，英雄的越南人民站在最前线。他们不仅为自己的独立和尊严而战，也是为世界上一切受到帝国主义侵略、干涉、控制和欺侮的国家和人民而战。越南人民的抗美救国战争，牵制和打击着美国最大的力量，这是对世界各国人民最大的支持，因此，越南人民的正义斗争，获得了全世界人民越来越普遍的同情、尊敬和支持。中国政府和中国人民，完全支持越南民主共和国胡志明主席的《告全国同胞书》，坚决支持越南人民打到底，直到取得抗美救国战争的最后胜利。
    朋友们，同志们！中国人民和非洲各国人民在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的共同斗争中，是同呼吸、共命运的战友。中国一贯根据和平共处的五项原则，发展同亚非国家的友好合作关系。我们一贯尊重各国的主权，主张大小国家一律平等，坚决反对干涉别国内政。我们一贯主张，亚非国家根据平等互利的原则，进行经济合作，在自力更生的基础上，促进各国经济的共同繁荣。我们的这种立场和态度，是绝不会改变的，是经得起考验的。我们深信，中国和非洲国家的友好合作关系，必将继续向前发展。
    中国和赞比亚两国人民有着共同的历史遭遇。在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的共同斗争中，两国人民一贯互相同情和互相支持。这两年来，我们两国的友好合作关系有了新的发展。赞比亚政府一贯反对帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋，支持恢复中国在联合国的合法权利。对此，我们表示感谢。在赞比亚人民反对帝国主义侵略、维护民族独立和建设自己国家的事业中，中国人民将始终是你们可靠的朋友。我相信，赞比亚的贵宾们，这次你们对我国的友好访问，对进一步加强我们两国友好合作关系，增进两国人民的了解和友谊，对加强亚非人民的团结，必将作出积极的贡献。我衷心地祝愿你们的这次访问，获得圆满的成功。
    现在，我建议大家举杯，
    为赞比亚共和国的繁荣富强和人民幸福，
    为中赞两国人民的友谊，
    为亚非团结和世界和平，
    为肯尼思·卡翁达总统阁下的健康，
    为卡曼加副总统阁下的健康，
    为卡普韦普韦外长阁下和夫人的健康，
    为赞比亚共和国政府代表团全体贵宾们的健康，
    为各国使节和夫人们的健康，
    为在座的各位朋友和同志们的健康，
    干杯！
    新华社十九日讯　赞比亚共和国副总统鲁本·奇坦迪卡·卡曼加在董必武副主席、周恩来总理欢迎宴会上的讲话，全文如下：中华人民共和国副主席先生，总理先生，诸位阁下，贵宾们，女士们，先生们：
    我很高兴能有机会来到你们这个伟大的人民共和国的首都北京，并在今晚向你们讲话。
    首先，我要转达卡翁达总统、他的政府和赞比亚共和国全体人民的非常热烈的问候和致意。
    其次，我想借此机会对你们给予我们的盛大欢迎表示我个人的深切的谢意和我们代表团的衷心感谢。副主席先生，广州和这个伟大城市的成百万人的欢乐的笑容使疑心最大的人也不能不信服：我们两国人民现在是好朋友，并且准备将来永远做好朋友。我们赞比亚决心使这些友好的纽带不断加强。
    阁下，在此我想正式告诉你、贵国政府和贵国人民，赞比亚在你们这个伟大城市设立大使馆的日子不远了。这对达到更好地相互了解、更好地知道彼此的问题这个渴望的目的，将起很大的作用。
    阁下，你们很了解我们访问的目的。但是，如果你们原谅我重复的话，我还想简单地提一下。作为一个友好代表团，我们感到我们应当利用我们来到这里的机会，来讨论有关国际事务，有关一般的和平问题，缓和世界紧张局势的迫切性和非殖民化的问题，以及在国内改善我们人民的状况的问题。
    我们赞比亚人民珍视世界各国人民的友谊。世界各国人民文化上和地理上可能是偶然地也可能是有意地在政治上、经济上属于不同的国家，但是他们有着共同的人性。他们的物质和精神的需要是相同的，虽然他们会选择不同的方式来最好地满足这些需要。人们常常说：人的特点与其说是在于他们有共同的信仰，倒不如说是在于他们有共同的问题。我们赞比亚人相信，共同的问题是承认有共同的人性的充分基础。
    首先，赞比亚了解你们为国际和平所作的努力。在贵国爆炸自己的第一颗核弹的时候，你们提出了控制使用这种武器和装置的建议。这是一个重要的表态，因为全世界都清楚，在今后十年内，发明、拥有和使用核武器者将不只限于目前这几个核大国。其次，副主席先生，你们对联合国的态度，表明你们愿意为国际和平和稳定作出贡献。在这方面，我愿重申，我国支持你们进入联合国的愿望。第三，我国注意到你们为加速非殖民化所作的不断努力。
    在经济发展和文化的领域里，我们两国都曾遭受过外来者的赤裸裸的剥削。你们在国家建设方面所面临过和仍面临着的问题，也摆在我们的面前。因此，有着交流经验的余地，而且我们相信我们能够从你们在建设方面先走的一段道路中获得益处。你们已经对建立我国第一座国立大学作出了贡献。对此，我们真诚地感激贵党的毛泽东主席、贵国政府和人民。
    阁下，我们希望，我们的讨论能导致贸易、经济合作援助和文化交流的增长。
    阁下，最后我愿再次感谢你们的最盛大的欢迎，并且向你们表示，我们期待着在中华人民共和国的逗留。
    我提议为毛泽东主席的健康，为中华人民共和国人民干杯！
