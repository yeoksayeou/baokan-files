Chairman Mao said: The People's Liberation Army should be a great school. This great school should study politics, study military affairs, study culture, and also engage in agricultural and sideline production, and operate some small and medium-sized factories to produce some of the products needed and products for equal exchange with the state. This great school should also engage in mass work, participate in the socialist education movement in factories and rural areas; after the socialist education movement, there is always mass work to be done, so that the military and the people are always united as one; and it should also participate in the cultural revolution to criticize the bourgeoisie at any time. In this way, military education, military agriculture, military industry, and military-civilian integration can all be combined. Of course, there must be appropriate allocation, with a main focus and a secondary focus. Agriculture, industry, and civilian work—one unit can only take on one or two of these, not all at the same time. In this way, the impact of several million troops will be very significant.

Ensure Mao Zedong Thought is Passed Down Through the Generations

Decades of practice have proven that turning the PLA into a revolutionary great school is Chairman Mao's consistent military thought. Resolutely following Chairman Mao's instructions will enable us to continuously develop and grow, and defeat powerful enemies both domestically and internationally. Chen Changfeng, Commander of a Certain Division of the PLA

Our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, recently issued the great call for the People's Liberation Army to be a great school. With boundless love, faith, and admiration for Chairman Mao, I have repeatedly studied this directive and found it particularly intimate and my spirits greatly uplifted. Chairman Mao is truly brilliant and great! Chairman Mao's directive is the greatest concern, the greatest trust, the greatest encouragement, and the greatest spur for us. I wholeheartedly support this brilliant directive and will resolutely implement this new directive.

Turning the People's Liberation Army into a revolutionary great school is Chairman Mao's consistent military thought. As early as the revolutionary war years, Chairman Mao issued the great call for our army to be a fighting force, a work force, and a production force. At that time, regardless of how frequent the wars were or how harsh the environment, we would concentrate our forces to fight battles and annihilate the enemy. After the battles ended, we would disperse to the countryside to carry out mass work, actively mobilizing, organizing, and arming the masses, uniting the military and the people to annihilate the enemy together. I remember in the spring of 1934, when the Central Soviet Government was stationed in Ruijin, Chairman Mao personally led the soldiers to Wu Yang Wei for a survey, helping the masses with production while propagating revolutionary ideas to them. The military and the people were in perfect harmony, and the masses said, "Since the beginning of time, this is the first time we have seen such a good army." Many people enlisted, and on May 1st alone, over a hundred young people joined the army. On the Long March, despite climbing mountains and crossing rivers, day and night, the struggle was extremely arduous, but wherever the army went, mass work was done there, and it was warmly welcomed by the masses. After the Red Army arrived in Yan'an, the enemy implemented an economic blockade to starve us to death. Under Chairman Mao's call for self-reliance and abundance, we reclaimed land, planted crops, raised pigs and vegetables, spun and wove cloth, dug caves, built houses, and set up repair factories, paper mills, ceramic factories, and woodworking factories. At that time, our cavalry unit reclaimed hundreds of acres of wasteland, achieving self-sufficiency in grain and vegetables. Through labor, not only did we completely smash the enemy's blockade, ensure the army's supply, and achieve a strong army and healthy horses, but our thoughts were also tempered and improved.

Decades of practice have proven that our army, following Chairman Mao's directive that the people's army is a fighting force, a work force, and a production force, has continuously developed and grown, defeated powerful enemies both domestically and internationally, and become a new type of people's army that is highly proletarianized and highly combat-ready.

Chairman Mao's new directive has great historical significance and is a new epoch-making development of Marxism-Leninism. I will resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest directive, together with all comrades in the army, to ensure that Mao Zedong Thought is passed down through the generations, and to advance our army on the path of being highly proletarianized and highly combat-ready!

    毛主席说：人民解放军应该是一个大学校。这个大学校，要学政治，学军事，学文化，又能从事农副业生产，又能办一些中小工厂，生产自己需要的若干产品和与国家等价交换的产品。这个大学校，又能从事群众工作，参加工厂、农村的社会主义教育运动；社会主义教育运动完了，随时都有群众工作可做，使军民永远打成一片；又要随时参加批判资产阶级的文化革命斗争。这样，军学、军农、军工、军民这几项都可以兼起来。当然，要调配适当，要有主有从，农、工、民三项，一个部队只能兼一项或两项，不能同时都兼起来。这样，几百万军队所起的作用就是很大的了。
    让毛泽东思想世世代代传下去
    几十年的实践证明，把解放军办成革命的大学校，是毛主席一贯的建军思想。坚决按照毛主席指示去作，就能不断发展壮大自己，战胜国内外的强大敌人。解放军某部师长　陈昌奉
    我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席，最近发出了人民解放军应该是一个大学校的伟大号召。我满怀对毛主席无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜的激情，反复学习了这一指示，感到格外亲切，心情特别振奋。毛主席真是太英明，太伟大了！毛主席的这一指示，是对我们的最大关怀，最大信任，最大鼓舞，最大鞭策，我最热烈地拥护这个英明的指示，坚决贯彻这一新的指示。
    把人民解放军办成革命的大学校，这是毛主席的一贯建军思想。早在革命战争年代，毛主席就发出了我军既是一个战斗队，又是一个工作队、一个生产队的伟大号召。那时，不管战争多么频繁，环境多么恶劣，我们集中起来就打仗，消灭敌人；战斗结束了，我们就分散到乡村开展群众工作，积极动员群众、组织群众、武装群众，军民打成一片，共同消灭敌人。记得一九三四年春，中央工农民主政府驻在瑞金时，毛主席亲自带领战士到武阳围进行调查，一面帮助群众生产，一面向群众宣传革命道理。军民融洽无间，群众说：“自古开天地，第一次看到这样好的军队。”许多人报名参军，仅五月一日一天入伍的青年就有一百多名。在长征路上，尽管爬山涉水，日夜兼程，斗争十分艰苦，部队走到哪里，就把群众工作做到哪里，受到了群众的热烈欢迎。红军到了延安后，敌人实行经济封锁，要扼杀困死我们。在毛主席自己动手、丰衣足食的伟大号召下，我们开荒种田，养猪种菜，纺纱织布，挖窑洞，盖房子，办起了修配厂、造纸厂、陶瓷厂、木工厂等。当时，我们骑兵队，就开垦了几百亩荒地，做到了粮食蔬菜自给有余。通过劳动，不仅彻底粉碎了敌人的封锁，保证了部队供应，做到了兵壮马肥，而且我们思想上受到锻炼，得到了提高。
    几十年的实践证明，我军遵循了毛主席关于人民军队是战斗队、工作队、生产队的指示，不断发展壮大了自己，战胜了国内外的强大敌人，成了一支非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的新型人民军队。
    毛主席这一新的指示，具有伟大的历史意义，是马克思列宁主义划时代的新发展。我坚决按照毛主席最新指示去办，和全军的同志们一道，让毛泽东思想世世代代传下去，使我军在非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的道路上阔步前进！
