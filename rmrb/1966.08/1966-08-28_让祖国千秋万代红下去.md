Comrades of the Red Guards in the Capital:

	Hello!

	When I read in the newspaper about you—Beijing Red Guards, with the support of revolutionary masses—storming the bastions of bourgeois customs and habits, and the waves of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution sweeping through the streets of the capital, I was deeply moved and enthusiastically cheer for your spirit of proletarian revolutionary rebellion!

	With Mao Zedong Thought as your weapon, you have raised the iron broom, sweeping away the dust of the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes. You have removed the stench of feudalism and capitalism emanating from the old street names and shop signs, striking fear into the hearts of those counter-revolutionary revisionists in the former Beijing Municipal Committee, and making the revolutionary masses proud. The new street names and shop signs are revolutionary language, shining with the spirit of the proletarian revolution, adding endless luster to our great capital, the center of the proletarian revolution.

	Dear comrades, I sincerely thank you. I will forever fight alongside you, as a little soldier of Chairman Mao. I will forever be loyal to our great teacher, great leader, great helmsman, and great commander, Chairman Mao, following the revolutionary course he has charted. Through countless tests in the great waves of mass movements, we will temper ourselves into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Our motherland will remain red forever, and the red sun of Mao Zedong Thought will forever shine upon the whole world.

	Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

	Long live our great teacher, great leader, great helmsman, and great commander, Chairman Mao!

	Long live the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

    让祖国千秋万代红下去首都红卫兵同志们：
    你们好！
    当我从报纸上看到你们——北京市红卫兵在革命群众支持下，猛烈冲击资产阶级风俗习惯，无产阶级文化大革命的浪潮席卷首都街道的消息后，十分激动，为你们这种无产阶级革命造反精神热烈欢呼！
    你们以毛泽东思想为武器，举起了铁扫帚，横扫剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯的灰尘，扫掉了旧街道名称和商店字号所散发出来的封建主义、资本主义的腐朽气息，扫得前北京市委那些反革命修正主义分子魂飞胆丧，使革命群众扬眉吐气。新的街道和商店名称是革命的语言，闪耀着无产阶级的革命精神，为我们伟大的首都，为无产阶级革命的中心，增添了无限的光彩。
    亲爱的同志们，我衷心感谢你们。我要永远同你们一起战斗，做毛主席的小兵。永远忠于我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席，沿着毛主席开辟的革命航道，在群众运动的大风大浪里，经过千百万次的考验，锤炼成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得更高，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。我们祖国将千秋万代红下去，让毛泽东思想的红太阳，永远照耀着全世界。
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席万岁！
    战无不胜的伟大的毛泽东思想万岁！
