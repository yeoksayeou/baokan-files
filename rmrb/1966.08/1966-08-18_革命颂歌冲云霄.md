At one in the morning, the cultural troops of the People's Liberation Army arrived at the reception station. They brought with them new performances praising the communiqué. Today, they had already performed at Beijing Railway Station and Tiananmen Square. Some comrades had hoarse voices, but they were still full of spirit. Despite the rain, they sang revolutionary songs full of fervor on the square of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's reception station.

The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army sang: The communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee is like a spring thunder that shakes the mountains and rivers. Every word and sentence stirs the hearts of 700 million people. It boosts the morale of the revolutionary people and crushes the enemy's arrogance. It is a declaration for advancing towards communism, a milestone for the new stage of the socialist revolution! It is a new victory for Mao Zedong Thought!

Recitation, unison singing, couplets, quick-talk, and dance ignited the revolutionary flames in the hearts of the audience. The cultural troops proposed: Let us all sing "The Boat Needs a Helmsman" together!

At this moment, everyone on and off the stage sang in unison, and the resonant voices echoed over the capital.

The performance ended, and the students who came to report good news joined the red cultural troops of the People's Liberation Army. Despite the heavy rain, they held each other's hands tightly and did not want to let go for a long time. Comrades meeting again were especially affectionate. The students congratulated the comrades of the People's Liberation Army for being red propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought, and the soldiers praised the students as a new generation loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. The staff of the reception station and passersby, seeing this scene, were equally moved. Some people were so excited that tears welled up in their eyes. Everyone spontaneously raised their arms and shouted, "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live the beloved great leader Chairman Mao!"

　　革命颂歌冲云霄
    深夜一点钟，解放军的文艺战士们来到接待站。他们带来了歌颂公报的新节目。今天，他们已经在北京车站、天安门广场作过表演，有的同志嗓子有些嘶哑了。但是，他们仍然精神焕发，又冒雨在中共中央群众接待站的广场上，唱出了革命豪情万分奔放的颂歌。
    解放军战士唱道：八届十一中全会公报，像一声春雷震山河，字字句句激动着七亿人民的心，长了革命人民的志气，灭了敌人的威风，它是走向共产主义的宣言书，社会主义革命新阶段的里程碑！是毛泽东思想的新胜利！
    朗诵、齐唱、对口词、快板、舞蹈，象火种一样燃烧起观众内心的革命烈火。文艺战士们提议：让我们大家一起歌唱《大海航行靠舵手》吧！
    这时，台上台下齐声高唱，嘹亮的歌声回绕在首都的上空。
    演出结束了，前来报喜的学生同解放军的红色文艺战士汇合在一起。他们不顾大雨倾盆，互相紧紧地握着双手，长时间不想放开。战友相逢，格外亲切。学生祝贺解放军的同志是毛泽东思想的红色宣传战士，战士赞扬学生是忠于毛泽东思想的新的一代。接待站的工作人员和过路人看到这种场面，心情同样激动，有的人兴奋得热泪盈眶。大家情不自禁地振臂高呼：“中国共产党万岁！”“敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！”
