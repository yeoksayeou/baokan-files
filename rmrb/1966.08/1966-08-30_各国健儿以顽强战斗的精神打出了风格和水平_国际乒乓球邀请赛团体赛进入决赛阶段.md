In today's matches, athletes from various countries demonstrated a tenacious fighting spirit, showcasing their unique styles and high standards, and received widespread praise from the audience.

The first match of the second stage's first group (deciding the first to third places) was between the Japanese men's and women's teams and the North Korean men's and women's teams. The match was intense and exciting, with many thrilling moments that repeatedly earned the audience's enthusiastic applause. The result was that the Japanese men's and women's teams won with scores of 5-2 and 3-0, respectively. North Korea's national champion Pak Sin-il performed exceptionally well, consecutively defeating Japan's Kiyoharu Kanemoto and Fukushima Manji with scores of 2-0 and 2-1. However, in the seventh game against Japan's champion Nagatani, he lost with a score of 1-2. Nagatani won against three North Korean players today, contributing significantly to Japan's victory.

In the second group's (deciding the fourth to sixth places) matches today, the Vietnamese men's and women's teams fought bravely and won against the Cambodian men's and women's teams with scores of 5-2 and 3-1, respectively.

After the match, Nguyen Duc Thu, the leader of the Vietnamese delegation, told reporters that the Vietnamese men's and women's teams' victory today was mainly due to thorough mental preparation beforehand. He said that during this competition, they received warm letters from Chinese revolutionary youth who expressed firm support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. This gave great encouragement to the Vietnamese athletes, who competed with this spirit. Nguyen Duc Thu also expressed that although there were victories and defeats in the competition between athletes from Vietnam and Cambodia, the friendship and unity between the two countries' peoples and athletes were more important.

Friendship is above championships, and unity is above victory and defeat, which was a feature of today's competition. In the afternoon's match between Palestine and Syria's women's teams, the Palestinian coach not only provided strategies for his team but also gave pointers to the Syrian team members. This spirit of unity and friendship, aiming for common progress, received unanimous praise from the audience.

    各国健儿以顽强战斗的精神打出了风格和水平
    国际乒乓球邀请赛团体赛进入决赛阶段
    据新华社二十九日讯　引人注目的一九六六年北京国际乒乓球邀请赛男、女团体赛，今天进入了第二阶段——决赛阶段。经过一天十二场比赛，整个团体赛的形势趋向明朗。
    在今天的比赛中，各国选手表现了顽强战斗的精神，打出了风格和水平，受到了观众的普遍赞扬。
    男、女团体赛第二阶段第一组（决第一至第三名）的比赛今晚只进行了一场，是由日本男、女队对朝鲜男、女队。他们打得紧张激烈，出现了许多精采的场面，不断赢得观众的热烈掌声。比赛结果，日本男、女队分别以五比二和三比○获胜。朝鲜全国冠军朴信一表现出色，他连续以二比○和二比一战胜了日本队的键本肇和福岛万治，但在第七盘和日本冠军长谷川相遇时，以一比二失利。日本队的长谷川今天连胜三名朝鲜选手，为日本队的胜利作出了贡献。日本和朝鲜男子其他各盘比赛的具体比分如下：福岛万治胜金昌虎，二比一；长谷川胜金永三，二比○；长谷川胜金昌虎，二比○；键本肇胜金永三，二比○。
    日本和朝鲜女子队的比赛结果是：山中教子胜吴贞子，二比○；森泽幸子胜金邦子，二比○；山中教子和深津尚子胜吴贞子和金邦子，二比一。
    在今天的男、女第二组（决第四至第六名）的比赛中，越南队男、女选手敢打敢拚，分别以五比二和三比一的比分战胜了柬埔寨男、女队。
    比赛结束后，越南代表团团长阮得寿对记者说，越南男、女队今天能取得胜利，主要是事先作了充分的思想准备。他说，在这次比赛中，我们曾收到中国革命青年的热情来信，他们在来信中对越南人民的抗美救国斗争表示了坚决的支持，这给越南运动员很大的鼓舞，越南运动员就是用这样精神去进行比赛的。阮得寿还表示，越、柬两国运动员的比赛虽然有胜有负，但是两国人民和运动员之间的友谊和团结则更为重要。
    友谊高于锦标，团结重于胜败，是今天比赛场上的一个特色。在下午进行的巴勒斯坦同叙利亚的女子比赛中，巴勒斯坦的教练不仅为本队队员出谋献策，还给予叙利亚队员以指点。这种体现团结友好，共同提高的精神，博得了观众的一致好评。
