	Leading the Chorus, Following the Master

	Things and people tend to group together. Sun Yefang and figures like Zhou Yang and Deng Tuo are all part of the same black gang. They all admire Khrushchev's revisionism and cheered for the 20th and 22nd Congresses of the CPSU. Sun Yefang said: "After the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the Soviet economic academic community made progress in overcoming dogmatism and linking theory with practice. This is reflected in the more lively and vibrant atmosphere of academic discussions." By "overcoming dogmatism," he means attacking Stalin, which is another way of denying the Marxism-Leninism that Stalin upheld. As Chairman Mao taught us: "Revisionists and right opportunists also talk about Marxism. They also attack 'dogmatism.' But what they attack is precisely the most fundamental aspects of Marxism." Sun Yefang's description of the atmosphere as "more lively and vibrant" is a euphemism for bourgeois liberalization. Sun Yefang's "lively and vibrant" and Khrushchev's revisionists' "thaw" are both counter-revolutionary code words. Khrushchev's revisionists said: "In the years following the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the situation has significantly improved. Scientific thought in the social sciences has become more active, and the phenomena of dogmatism and quoting scriptures have been overcome..." One says "significantly improved," the other says "progress"; one says "become more active," the other says "more lively and vibrant." Sun Yefang and Khrushchev's revisionists are singing in perfect harmony! Truly, leading the chorus, following the master.

	After the 20th Congress of the CPSU in 1956, Sun Yefang visited the Soviet Union three times. He exchanged ideas with almost all the revisionist economists in the Soviet economic community and was deeply impressed, holding them in the highest regard. Sun Yefang's revisionist economic "theories" are merely copies of Soviet revisionist economic "theories."

	Every time Sun Yefang visited the Soviet Union, upon his return, he would spread poison. In 1956, after returning from the Soviet Union, Sun Yefang released two poisonous weeds, "Starting from Total Output" and "Placing Planning and Statistics on the Basis of the Law of Value." He shamelessly said: "The basic views on the law of value and planning and statistical work mentioned here were all picked up from Soviet comrades during my visit." In 1959, after visiting the Soviet Union, he threw out another poisonous weed, "On Value," and he brazenly said: "I merely reiterated the views of Soviet economist Sobol, an expert on national economic balance."

	After the 22nd Congress of the CPSU in 1961, Sun Yefang, in response to Khrushchev's revisionists, changed his main method of attacking the Party and socialism from publishing articles openly to writing "internal research reports." He shifted from propagating revisionist "theories" to proposing a series of revisionist policy suggestions, vigorously advocating for the restoration of capitalism in China. The set of economic liberalization proposals Sun Yefang advocated around issues of profit and management systems are all the economic liberalization proposals made by Liberman and others under Khrushchev's instructions after the 22nd Congress of the CPSU. The set of revisionist fallacies he advocated around issues of commodity production, the law of value, and production prices are all the revisionist goods of Soviet modern revisionist economists.

	Sun Yefang has been following Khrushchev's revisionists, turning in circles, step by step, and has already degenerated into a faithful dog of Khrushchev's revisionism. Whatever Sun Yefang says has been said by Khrushchev's revisionists; whatever Sun Yefang wants to do is what Khrushchev's revisionists have done in the Soviet Union to restore capitalism. We will never forget the lesson of the Khrushchev clique in the Soviet Union seizing the Party, the army, and the government, and restoring capitalism. Khrushchev has already fallen, and those who follow in Khrushchev's footsteps, including his dog Sun Yefang, will not escape the same fate.

　　主唱奴随
    物以类聚，人以群分。孙冶方和周扬、邓拓这些黑帮分子一样，对赫鲁晓夫修正主义十分欣赏，为苏共二十大、二十二大欢呼。孙冶方说：“苏共二十次代表大会后，苏联经济学界在克服教条主义和联系实际上是有进步的，这表现在学术讨论的空气比较生动活泼。”他这里所说的“克服教条主义”，就是对斯大林攻击的另一种说法，就是否定斯大林坚持的马克思列宁主义。正如毛主席所教导的：“修正主义者，右倾机会主义者，口头上也挂着马克思主义，他们也在那里攻击‘教条主义’。但是他们所攻击的正是马克思主义的最根本的东西。”孙冶方这里所说的“空气比较生动活泼”，就是资产阶级自由化。孙冶方说的“生动活泼”，和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者所说的“解冻”，都是反革命的黑话。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者说：“在苏共二十大以后的年代里，情况显著地改善了。社会科学方面的科学思想活跃起来了，教条主义和引经据典的现象正被克服……。”一个说“显著改善”，一个说“有进步”；一个说“活跃起来了”，一个说“生动活泼”。孙冶方和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者唱的调子是多么合拍！真是主唱奴随。
    一九五六年苏共二十大以后，孙冶方三次访苏。他同苏联经济学界的修正主义分子几乎都“交流过思想”，对他们佩服得五体投地，推崇备至。孙冶方的修正主义经济“理论”，就是苏联修正主义经济“理论”的翻版。
    孙冶方每次访苏，一回国，就大肆放毒。一九五六年回国后，孙冶方就放出了《从总产值谈起》和《把计划和统计放在价值规律的基础上》两株大毒草，他恬不知耻地说：“这里面所讲到的有关价值规律和计划统计工作的一些基本见解，都是在考察时拾自苏联同志的牙慧。”一九五九年访苏回国后，他又抛出《论价值》这株大毒草，他厚颜无耻地说：“我只是转述了苏联经济学者国民经济平衡专家索波里同志的见解。”
    一九六一年苏共二十二大以后，孙冶方和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者相呼应，把向党向社会主义进攻的主要方式，由公开发表文章改为写“内部研究报告”，由宣扬修正主义“理论”转向提出一系列修正主义政策主张，加紧鼓吹在中国实行资本主义复辟。孙冶方围绕利润和管理体制问题宣扬的一套经济自由化的主张，全是苏共二十二大以后，在赫鲁晓夫授意下发表的利别尔曼等人经济自由化的主张。他围绕商品生产、价值规律和生产价格问题宣扬的一套修正主义谬论，都是苏联现代修正主义御用经济学家的修正主义货色。
    孙冶方跟着赫鲁晓夫修正主义者团团转，亦步亦趋，已经堕落成赫鲁晓夫修正主义的忠实走狗。孙冶方所讲的，都是赫鲁晓夫修正主义者讲过的；孙冶方想要做的，都是赫鲁晓夫修正主义者在苏联所搞的复辟资本主义的活动。我们决不会忘记苏联赫鲁晓夫集团篡党、篡军、篡政，实行资本主义复辟的教训。赫鲁晓夫已经垮台了，沿着赫鲁晓夫的脚印走的人，包括他们的走狗孙冶方在内，决不能逃脱同样的命运。
