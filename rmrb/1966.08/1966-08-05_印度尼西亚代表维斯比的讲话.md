Dear Comrade Guo Moruo, Comrade Senanayake, and Comrade Liao Chengzhi:

The Indonesian delegation, along with other Asian and African writers' delegations, has completed nearly three weeks of visits to Northeast and Northwest China and has now arrived at the final destination of our journey, the prosperous city of Shanghai. The people here have a tradition of heroism and patriotism in China's revolution and in the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, as well as of the world.

Our delegation would like to express our gratitude to the Chinese government, the Chinese people, and the Chinese Writers' Association for giving us the opportunity to visit Shanghai, where the world-renowned revolutionary writer Lu Xun spent important moments of his life. Whether visiting the Northwest or the Northeast, our delegation has always been warmly and cordially welcomed. Shanghai is filled with the roar of factory machinery, but the drums and applause of the smiling Shanghai people welcoming us are even louder.

The entire visit has left us with a deep impression: China is currently carrying out a widespread and in-depth movement to study the works of Chairman Mao. Not only people but even stones have been transformed into lush, fertile, and beautiful fields. What impressed us the most is how Mao Zedong Thought is combined with practice, especially with specific practice, and how it is verified by specific practice. More importantly, Mao Zedong Thought has been verified by the concrete revolutionary practices of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, each with its own characteristics.

Currently, we see that China is launching a magnificent proletarian cultural revolution, an unprecedented event in the history of world culture, just as the Long March to Yan'an was an unprecedented event in the history of world military affairs. The Chinese people have won another victory by seizing another reactionary stronghold.

Chairman Mao said: "Food must be eaten one bite at a time. Victories must be won one by one." This truth is bad news for American imperialism and its lackeys. Imperialists are not only losing piece by piece of their territory; they will lose everything: China, Vietnam, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. American imperialism will even be completely wiped off the face of the earth.

A certain ambitious socialist country attempts to change what we see in China, to turn its red into white. This is just a dream they have at night. They often wake up late and miss the bright morning sun. In fact, the cultural revolution in China has clearly responded to them. This cultural revolution also demonstrates the high vigilance of the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

During visits to some factories, we can concretely see the shameful and evil actions of modern revisionists under the guise of "technical assistance" from the so-called Soviet Union to China, which aims to place Chinese industrial technology in a second- or third-rate position. However, Mao Zedong Thought and the principle of self-reliance have overcome this evil deed. The people of Shanghai have finally succeeded in manufacturing a 12,000-ton hydraulic press, and the Chinese people have finally detonated their nuclear bomb.

To support the struggle of the Vietnamese people, the emergency meeting of Asian and African writers held in Beijing timely condemned the savage crimes of American imperialism in bombing Hanoi and Haiphong. During our visits to factories, communes, and other projects, we often see a sincere and clear attitude of supporting Vietnam and resisting America. This is also a resounding slap in the face of the number one friend of American imperialism, the revisionist who colludes with the U.S. and maintains ambiguous relations with Chiang Kai-shek and Park Chung-hee, a revisionist without Khrushchev.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh called on the 31 million Vietnamese people to unite and overcome all difficulties to smash the American imperialists' "Letter to the Nation," which is also a heavy blow to those peddling the American "peace talks" scam.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi recently declared that the Chinese people, regardless of the risks they have to bear or the sacrifices they have to make, will resolutely support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation until they achieve complete victory. Chairman Liu Shaoqi also declared that China's territory is a solid rear base for the Vietnamese people. This clear statement once again shows us that China is a true friend of the Vietnamese people, who have been assisting the Vietnamese people's struggle from the very beginning and increased their support when the Vietnamese people and the peoples of Asia and Africa were in their most difficult times. American imperialism and its "number one friend" cannot stop the peoples of Asia and Africa from expressing their spirit of solidarity with the Vietnamese people, and the peoples of Asia and Africa will never abandon their spirit of solidarity with the Vietnamese people. They will smash American imperialism on their own soil.

The Chinese people and the Indonesian people have a long historical relationship.

Under the manipulation of the U.S. and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, the current Nasution-Suharto fascist military clique has been even more savage than Hitler's Nazis in destroying and defiling the friendly relations between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples. We will not repeat the facts that everyone already knows; we just want to point out one thing: the relationship between China and Indonesia is not just a traditional relationship; more importantly, it is a friendly relationship of struggle against imperialism, a relationship of friendly comrades-in-arms! The friendship between the Chinese people and the Indonesian people is as solid as the rocks that connect China and Indonesia. In the face of the Indonesian people and the people of the world, these puppets of American imperialism will only break their own necks and expose their reactionary nature.

The awakening people will soon throw these puppets from their thrones into the garbage heap! The Nasution-Suharto fascist military clique, through the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly and the People's Consultative Assembly that has been stripped of its revolutionary content, has done everything to deceive the people and cover up the fact that the current government is not the government of the council of generals. However, the Indonesian people who have suffered from the savage crimes of the current government and have seen these crimes fail will not be deceived by the new cabinet, no matter what form it takes. The new cabinet formed less than a month ago is just the cabinet of the council of generals. These generals are implementing vicious racism, truly destroying the economic supply organization that has never been replaced for centuries, making the people even poorer, and ruining Indonesia's economy.

Recently, Suharto hysterically said that anyone who opposes the current cabinet he leads will be suppressed by the armed forces! This is the angry voice of their internal strife, a voice that fears the awakened Indonesian people who do not want to be sold to the imperialists currently plundering the economy in Indonesia. The armed provocations of the Nasution-Suharto clique will certainly be severely struck by the awakening Indonesian people.

A thousand lies cannot cover up one truth: the Nasution-Suharto fascist military clique, like American imperialism, is a paper tiger!

Friends, the emergency meeting of Asian and African writers has been successfully held and has shown the fighting unity and great victories in supporting the struggle of the Vietnamese people and the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia and Africa. This democratic meeting has not only successfully thwarted the conspiracy of Soviet splitters to sabotage the revolutionary movement of Asian and African writers but has also passed resolutions to further advance the revolutionary writers' movement. Chinese writers and the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have made a great contribution to the success of this meeting. The high anti-imperialist spirit, revolutionary attitude, and goodwill of Asian and African writers have also made important contributions to the success of this meeting. Therefore, our delegation believes that the Third Asian and African Writers' Conference to be held in China next year will certainly achieve even greater success.

The Indonesian delegation would like to express our gratitude to the great Chinese people for their selfless support for the revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people. In the presence of friends representing the seven million people of Shanghai attending the conference, our delegation would also like to express our gratitude to the Asian and African writers for their brave and sincere support for the revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people. All this will certainly boost the morale of the Indonesian people and strengthen their resolve to fight against the Nasution-Suharto fascist military clique, the running dogs of American imperialism.

Victory to the heroic Vietnamese people!

Victory to the peoples of Asia and Africa!

Victory to the Indonesian people!

Victory to the united and struggling Asian and African writers!

Mao Zedong Thought will certainly triumph in China and elsewhere!

Long live the great Chinese people!

Thank you!

### 印度尼西亚代表维斯比的讲话

专栏：

    印度尼西亚代表维斯比的讲话亲爱的郭沫若同志、森纳那亚克同志、廖承志同志：
    印度尼西亚代表团和其他亚非作家代表团一起，在中国东北和西北访问了将近三星期之后，已来到了旅途的终点，那就是以繁荣著名的上海市，这里的人民在中国的革命和亚非拉以及全世界人民的革命斗争中具有英雄主义和爱国主义的传统。
    我们代表团想对中国政府，中国人民以及中国作家协会表示谢意，感谢他们给我们机会访问上海，在那里，世界闻名的革命作家鲁迅度过了他一生中重要时刻。不论是访问西北或者东北，我们代表团总是受到热烈而友好的欢迎。上海充满了工厂机器的隆隆声，但是面带笑容欢迎我们的上海人民的鼓声和掌声则更加响亮。
    整个参观访问给我们留下了深刻的印象，那就是中国目前正在开展一个广泛、深入学习毛主席著作的运动；不要说是人，即使是石头也被改变成了绿油油的、肥沃的、美丽的耕田。给我们印象最深的是毛泽东思想同实践相结合，特别是同具体实践相结合，而它又如何为具体实践所证实。更重要的是毛泽东思想已被具有各自特点的亚非拉的革命具体实践所证实。
    目前我们看到了中国正在展开轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命运动，这是世界文化史上无比的大事件，正如向延安进军的长征是世界军事史上无比的大事件一样。中国人民由于夺取了又一个反动堡垒，中国人民又赢得了一次胜利。
    毛主席说：饭要一口一口吃。胜利是要一个一个去争取的。毛主席这句话的真理对美帝国主义和它的走狗来说是件倒霉的事，帝国主义者不仅正在失去一块一块地盘，他们还将失去一切：失去中国，失去越南，失去亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲。美帝国主义甚至将从地球上被完全消灭掉。
    某个具有野心的社会主义国家企图改变我们所看到的中国，把它的红色变成白色。这是他们深夜做梦。他们经常晚起，看不到早晨灿烂的太阳。其实中国文化革命已明确对他们给以答复。这次文化革命也表现了用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民的高度警惕性。
    在参观一些工厂的时候，我们可以具体看到现代修正主义者在所谓苏联对中国进行“技术援助”名义下所进行的无耻的罪恶行动，这种“援助”的确是要把中国工业技术置于第二流或第三流的地位。但是毛泽东思想和自力更生的原则已战胜了这个罪恶行径。上海市人民终于成功地制造出了一万二千吨水压机，中国人民终于爆炸了它的核弹。
    为了支援越南人民的斗争，在北京举行的亚非作家紧急会议及时地谴责了美帝国主义轰炸河内和海防的野蛮罪行。我们在一些工厂、公社和其它项目的参观访问中，经常可以看到表现出的真诚而明确的援越抗美的态度。这也是中国工人和农民给美帝国主义的头号朋友、即与美帝进行勾结并与蒋介石、朴正熙保持暧昧关系的没有赫鲁晓夫的赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的一记响亮的耳光。
    胡志明主席号召三千一百万越南人民团结一致不怕任何困难来粉碎美帝国主义的《告全国同胞书》，也是对兜售美帝“和谈骗局”的人的一个沉重的打击。
    刘少奇主席最近宣告，中国人民不论要担多大的风险，不论需要作出多大的牺牲，都坚决支持越南人民抗美救国的斗争直到取得完全胜利。刘少奇主席还宣告，中国的领土是越南人民牢固的后方。这个明确的声明再一次向我们表明中国是越南人民的真正朋友，他们从一开始就援助越南人民的斗争，而在越南人民和亚非人民斗争处于最困难的时刻，他们增加了援助。美帝国主义和它的“头号朋友”不能阻止亚非人民表示同越南人民团结一致的精神，而亚非人民也决不会放弃他们同越南人民团结一致的精神，他们将在他们自己的土地上粉碎美帝。
    中国人民同印度尼西亚人民具有悠久的历史传统关系。
    在美帝和美国中央情报局的操纵下，目前纳苏蒂安—苏哈托法西斯军事集团在破坏和玷污中国和印度尼西亚人民友好关系方面进行了比希特勒纳粹更为野蛮的行为。我们不去重复大家所已知道事实，我们只想要说明一件事情，那就是中国和印度尼西亚人民的关系不仅仅是传统关系，更重要的，这是反对美帝的战斗的友好关系，是友好的战友关系！中国人民和印度尼西亚人民之间的这种友谊就象使中国和印度尼西亚相连的岩石那么牢固。在印度尼西亚人民和全世界人民面前，美帝国主义的这些傀儡只会碰断自己的脖子，并暴露出自己的反动本质。
    正在觉醒的人民把这些傀儡从他们的宝座上扔到垃圾堆里的时刻即将到来！纳苏蒂安—苏哈托法西斯军事集团通过临时人民协商会议和已被抽掉革命内容的合作议会干的一切勾当都是为了欺骗人民，为了进行掩饰，好象现政权不是法西斯将领委员会的政权。但是身受现政权的野蛮罪行之害、并亲眼看到这种罪行遭到破产的印度尼西亚人民决不会受到新内阁的欺骗，不管新内阁采取什么形式。在不到一个月以前成立的新内阁只是将领委员会的内阁。这些将领们正在实行万恶的种族主义，他们真正在破坏几个世纪以来一直没有被取代的经济供应组织，而使得人民更加贫困，并使印度尼西亚的经济遭到破坏。
    最近苏哈托歇斯底里地说，谁要反对他目前领导的内阁，就将受到武装部队的镇压！这是他们自己彼此争吵的愤怒声音，这种声音害怕那些不愿被卖给目前在印尼进行经济掠夺的帝国主义者的觉醒了的印尼人民。纳苏蒂安—苏哈托集团的武装挑衅必定会受到正在觉醒的印尼人民的严重打击。
    一千句谎言掩盖不了一个真理，那就是纳苏蒂安—苏哈托法西斯军事集团就象美帝国主义一样是只纸老虎！
    朋友们，亚非作家紧急会议已成功地举行了，并已显示了支援越南人民斗争和亚非人民革命斗争的战斗团结和巨大胜利。这个民主的会议不仅已成功地挫败了苏联分裂主义者企图破坏亚非作家革命运动的阴谋，而且也通过了将进一步推进革命作家运动的决议。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国作家和中国人民为这次会议的成功作出了巨大的贡献。亚非作家高昂的反帝精神，所持的革命态度和良好愿望，也已对这次会议的成功作出了重要的贡献。因此，我们代表团相信，明年在中国召开的第三届亚非作家大会肯定将取得更大成就。
    印尼代表团想对给予印尼人民革命斗争无私支持的伟大中国人民表示感谢。在代表七百万上海人民参加大会的朋友面前，我们代表团也想对亚非作家所给予印尼人民革命斗争的勇敢而真诚的支持表示感谢。这一切肯定能鼓起印尼人民的勇气，壮大印尼人民的胆量，为粉碎美帝国主义走狗纳苏蒂安—苏哈托法西斯军事集团而斗争。
    英雄的越南人民必胜！
    亚非人民必胜！
    印尼人民必胜！
    团结和斗争的亚非作家必胜！
    毛泽东思想一定会在中国而且在其他地方取得胜利！
    伟大的中国人民万岁！
    谢谢！
