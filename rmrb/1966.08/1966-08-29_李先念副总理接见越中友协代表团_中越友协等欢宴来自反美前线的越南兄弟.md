Vice Premier Li Xiannian received the delegation from the Vietnam-China Friendship Association today in the afternoon. The delegation was led by Vice Chairman Sun Guangzha of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association. Li Xiannian had a cordial and friendly conversation with the delegation members.

Present at the reception were Zhang Zhirou, Chu Tuonan, Ding Xilin, Zhao Boping, and Yao Guang, among others.

Vietnamese Ambassador to China Chen Ziping and the head of the delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China, Chen Wencheng, were also present.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 28th, the China-Vietnam Friendship Association and the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries held a banquet this evening to warmly welcome the delegation from the Vietnam-China Friendship Association.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian attended the banquet.

Chu Tuonan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, and Sun Guangzha, leader of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association delegation, both spoke at the banquet.

Chu Tuonan enthusiastically praised the Vietnamese people's heroic struggle against American imperialism. He said, "Your struggle sets a brilliant example of daring to fight and daring to win for revolutionary peoples of all countries." Chu Tuonan condemned the Soviet modern revisionists for playing the role of the chief accomplice in the U.S. imperialists' plot of "bombing and negotiating." He said, "Chairman Mao pointed out that U.S. imperialism and the reactionaries of all countries are paper tigers. No matter how much the U.S. imperialists escalate their aggressive war, they cannot escape the inevitable fate of failure. The 'Declaration of President Ho Chi Minh' once again proclaims the Vietnamese people's determination to fight to the end and achieve final victory. The Chinese people are determined to be the backbone of the Vietnamese people, and will take whatever actions deemed necessary by the peoples of China and Vietnam to jointly strike back at the American aggressors."

Sun Guangzha said in his speech, "In the cause of resisting U.S. aggression and saving the nation, we have always regarded China as a vast and most reliable rear base. The strong and enthusiastic support of the Chinese people is a great encouragement to our people's determination to defeat the U.S. aggressors."

He expressed that the Vietnamese people's people's war, which is invincible in the world, with the sincere support of 700 million Chinese people as its backbone, will surely achieve victory.

Sun Guangzha also enthusiastically praised the great proletarian cultural revolution that the Chinese people are successfully carrying out.
