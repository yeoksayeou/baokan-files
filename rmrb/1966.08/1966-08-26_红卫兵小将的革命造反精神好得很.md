Red Guards, the young revolutionaries of the capital:

Chairman Mao says, "Where the broom does not reach, the dust will not disappear by itself." You listen to the Party the most, listen to Chairman Mao the most, and love Mao Zedong Thought the most. You have raised the revolutionary iron broom to sweep away all old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits. The proletarian revolutionary rebel spirit of the Red Guards is excellent!

On the 23rd, the young revolutionaries of the Red Guards in Shenyang took to the streets, posting revolutionary slogans and big-character posters everywhere, giving speeches and spreading propaganda, and launching a fierce attack on all the customs and habits of the exploiting classes. In just one day, they thoroughly cleaned up many street names and shop signs that carried the colors of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism. Many streets and shops were renamed with revolutionary meanings. This is a new great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a new great victory for the proletarian cultural revolution. The revolutionary workers in our store, inspired by the revolutionary spirit and actions of the Red Guards, have written big-character posters to express their determination: to resolutely break with the old and establish the new, and change our store's name to "Dongfanghong Grocery Store." Some female workers have also changed their previously unhealthy hairstyles, determined to thoroughly eliminate their bourgeois thoughts.

The East is red, the sun is rising. We want Mao Zedong Thought to occupy all ideological positions, to let the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminate every corner. We resolutely uphold Mao Zedong Thought, making it the guiding principle for all work of the entire Party and the nation. Only in this way can we better serve the people and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end.

Red Guards, young revolutionaries: you have rebelled correctly, justly, and timely! We, the workers, peasants, and soldiers, most enthusiastically and resolutely support your thorough revolutionary spirit. We are your powerful revolutionary backing. We firmly stand on your side, unite closely with the Party Central Committee and our most, most revered great leader Chairman Mao around the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and raise it higher to carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end! Smash the old world thoroughly and build a new world!

Long live the proletarian cultural revolution!
Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!
Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!

Shenyang Dongfanghong Grocery Store, Li Suwen

    红卫兵小将的革命造反精神好得很首都红卫兵小将们：
    毛主席说：“扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。”你们最听党的话，最听毛主席的话，最热爱毛泽东思想。你们举起革命的铁扫帚，横扫一切旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯。红卫兵的无产阶级革命造反精神好得很！
    二十三日，沈阳市的红卫兵小将们，纷纷走上街头，到处张贴革命的标语，贴革命的大字报，到处演说、宣传，向一切剥削阶级的风俗习惯猛烈开火。在短短的一天之内，就把许多带有封建主义、资本主义和修正主义思想色彩的街道名称、商店字号，来了个大扫除。许多街道和商店改成具有革命意义的名称和字号。这是毛泽东思想的新的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的新的伟大胜利。我们商店的革命职工，在红卫兵革命精神和革命行动的鼓舞下，纷纷写大字报表示决心：坚决破旧立新，把我们商店改名为“东方红副食品商店”。有的女职工，也改变了过去不健康的发型，决心要彻底清除自己的资产阶级思想。
    东方红，太阳升，我们要让毛泽东思想占领一切思想阵地，要让毛泽东思想的光辉照亮每一个角落。我们坚决地大立毛泽东思想，把毛泽东思想作为全党全国一切工作的指导方针。只有这样，我们才能更好地为人民服务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    红卫兵的革命小将们：你们造反造得正确，造得有理，造得及时！我们工农兵群众最热烈、最坚决地支持你们的彻底革命精神。我们是你们的强大的革命后盾。我们坚定地站在你们一边，同你们紧紧地团结在党中央和我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的周围，更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！彻底砸碎旧世界，建立新世界！
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
      沈阳市东方红副食品商店　李素文
