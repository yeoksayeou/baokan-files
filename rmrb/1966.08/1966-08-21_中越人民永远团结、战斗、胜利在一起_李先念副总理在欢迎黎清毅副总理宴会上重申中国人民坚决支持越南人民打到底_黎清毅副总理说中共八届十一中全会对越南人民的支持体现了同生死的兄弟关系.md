Vice Premier Li Xiannian held a banquet tonight to warmly welcome Vice Premier Le Quang Doi of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese government economic delegation he leads. Vice Premier Li Xiannian and Vice Premier Le Quang Doi both spoke at the banquet.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian said, the arrival of the Vietnamese guests brings us the joyous news of the Vietnamese people's victory in their struggle against American imperialism and for national salvation, and brings us the fraternal affection of the Vietnamese people. This is a great encouragement to the Chinese people who are currently carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian praised the brilliant victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in their struggle against American imperialism and for national salvation, and pointed out that Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to All Compatriots" represents the Vietnamese people's resolute will to fight to the end against the American imperialists. It has dealt a heavy blow to the "peace talks" conspiracy of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian condemned the recent conspiracy by the American imperialists to orchestrate "peace talks" through Thailand, the Philippines, and "Malaysia." He said, the American imperialists' conspiracy will definitely not succeed. It will meet with the same shameful failure as the previous "peace talks" activities centered around Moscow.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian said, China is a socialist country armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. It is the international duty of the Chinese people to support and assist the Vietnamese people in their struggle against American imperialism and for national salvation. The recent Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of our Party once again expressed: "We most enthusiastically and resolutely support Chairman Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's 'Letter to All Compatriots,' and we resolutely support the Vietnamese people in fighting to the end until they achieve final victory in their struggle against American imperialism and for national salvation. The plenary session fully agrees with the measures and actions already taken and to be taken by our Party Central Committee and our government in cooperation with the Vietnamese side to aid Vietnam in its struggle against American imperialism." The Vietnamese people can be completely assured that the Chinese people will forever stand united with the Vietnamese people, fight together with them, and achieve victory together with them!

Vice Premier Le Quang Doi, in his speech, expressed gratitude to the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people for their full support and assistance to the revolutionary cause and the struggle against American imperialism of the Vietnamese people.

Vice Premier Le Quang Doi condemned the American imperialists' new escalation of the war of aggression against Vietnam and their "peace talks" deception. He said, the American imperialists' frenzied war actions cannot shake the will of our people. On the contrary, they only strengthen our people's fighting determination to make any sacrifice and achieve final victory. Our entire Party, army, and people have issued a fighting oath to fight to the end until we achieve complete victory.

Vice Premier Le Quang Doi said, the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the statement by Chairman Liu Shaoqi on July 22, 1966, as well as the telegram from Chairman Zhu De to Chairman Long Cheng, have given the Vietnamese people the most enthusiastic and resolute support. This has made all the people of North and South Vietnam extremely excited and has strengthened our military and civilian determination to achieve complete victory. It embodies the most intimate, life-and-death brotherly relationship between the peoples of Vietnam and China.

Vice Premier Le Quang Doi enthusiastically praised the brilliant achievements of the Chinese people under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong. He said, Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the great socialist revolution and socialist construction of China, achieving great victories. The Vietnamese people are extremely excited about the great achievements of the Chinese people. The great Communist Party of China and the Chinese people are the most intimate brothers and comrades of the Labor Party and people of Vietnam.

Those invited to attend the banquet included Chen Wencheng, head of the Permanent Representative Office of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China, and diplomatic officials from the Vietnamese Embassy in China.

Those attending the banquet also included responsible officials from relevant departments such as Yang Xiufeng, Peng Shaohui, Fang Yi, Han Nianlong, and Li Qiang. Before the banquet, Vice Premier Li Xiannian met with Vice Premier Le Quang Doi and all members of the delegation.

    李先念副总理说，越南贵宾的到来，给我们带来了越南人民抗美救国斗争的胜利喜讯，带来了越南人民的兄弟情谊，这对于正在进行无产阶级文化大革命的中国人民是一个莫大的鼓舞。
    李先念副总理赞扬了越南人民在抗美救国斗争中取得的辉煌的胜利，并指出，胡志明主席的《告全国同胞书》代表了越南人民誓与美帝打到底的坚强意志，它沉重地打击了帝修反的“和谈”阴谋。
    李先念副总理谴责了美帝国主义最近策动泰国、菲律宾和“马来西亚”搞的“和谈”阴谋。他说，美帝国主义的这个阴谋，是一定不能得逞的，它将同前一时期以莫斯科为中心的“和谈”活动一样，遭到可耻的破产。
    李先念副总理说，中国是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的社会主义国家，支持和援助越南人民的抗美救国斗争，是中国人民义不容辞的国际义务。最近举行的我党八届十一中全会再次表示：“最热烈、最坚决地支持越南民主共和国主席胡志明同志的《告全国同胞书》，坚决支持越南人民打到底，直到取得抗美救国战争的最后胜利。全会完全同意我党中央和我国政府同越南方面商定的关于援越抗美的一切已经采取的措施和将要采取的行动。”越南人民完全可以相信，中国人民将永远和越南人民团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起！
    黎清毅副总理在讲话中表示感谢中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民对越南人民的革命事业和抗美救国斗争所给予的全力支持和援助。
    黎清毅副总理谴责了美帝国主义对越南侵略的新战争升级和玩弄的“和谈”骗局。他说，美帝国主义疯狂的战争行动，并不能使我国人民动摇，相反的只能增强我国人民不怕任何牺牲、取得最后胜利的战斗决心。我们全党、全军、全民已经发出战斗的誓言，决心打到底，直到取得完全的胜利。
    黎清毅副总理说，中国共产党第八届中央委员会第十一次全体会议和一九六六年七月二十二日刘少奇主席的声明以及朱德委员长给长征主席的电报，给了越南人民最热烈、最坚决的支持。这使越南南北方全体人民无比兴奋，坚定了我国军民争取彻底胜利的决心。它体现了越中两国人民最亲切的同生死的兄弟关系。
    黎清毅副总理热烈赞扬了中国人民在伟大领袖毛泽东主席领导下取得的辉煌成就。他说，毛泽东思想照亮了伟大中国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的道路，取得了伟大胜利。越南人民对中国人民所取得的伟大成就感到无比兴奋。伟大的中国共产党和中国人民，是越南劳动党和人民的最亲密的兄弟和同志。
    应邀出席宴会的有，越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团团长陈文成和越南驻中国大使馆外交官员。
