	Firmly Support You, Red Guards!

	When we heard from the radio that the revolutionary youngsters, the Red Guards of Beijing, were holding high the great red banner of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and were launching a fierce attack on the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits left over from the old society, and had changed many street names, shop names, and old signs that carried the colors of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, adding boundless splendor to the capital of the world proletarian revolution—the city we love so much—we were filled with boundless excitement and immense joy.

	Red Guards, you have done well! You have done right! You have done it splendidly! We, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, firmly and enthusiastically support your revolutionary actions. We shout: Long live the revolutionary spirit of the Red Guards!

	Although our country has been liberated for seventeen years, the remnants of the old ruling classes still exist to varying degrees, poisoning and corrupting people's souls. To achieve the transformation of people's ideology and to build a brand-new socialist society and transition to communism, we must thoroughly eliminate these remnants of the old forces, uproot the source of revisionism, block the door to capitalist restoration, and sweep away all the garbage left over from the old society. This is the lifelong battle task for every revolutionary.

	Red Guards, you have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, followed the teachings of Chairman Mao, and with the spirit of "seizing the day" launched a fierce attack on the "Four Olds," achieving remarkable results. This is another great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Your spirit of taking the lead and daring to revolution fully shows that you are worthy of being the revolutionary youth by Chairman Mao's side, worthy of being the revolutionary vanguards. We, the workers, peasants, and soldiers, are proud to have you as our comrades. We will definitely fight shoulder to shoulder with you, launch the most comprehensive and fierce attack on the "Four Olds," and vow to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, not resting until we achieve complete victory!

    坚决支持你们，红卫兵！
    当我们从广播里听到北京市的革命小将红卫兵们，高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大破旧社会遗留下来的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，改掉了许多带有封建主义、资本主义、修正主义色彩的街道、商店的旧名称、旧字号，为世界无产阶级革命的中心——我们可爱的首都增添了无限光彩的消息以后，无比兴奋，万分激动。
    革命小将红卫兵们，你们干得好！干得对！干得痛快！我们解放军战士最坚决、最热烈地支持你们这一革命行动。我们高呼：红卫兵们的革命造反精神万岁！
    我国虽然已经解放十七年了，但是，由于过去剥削阶级的长期统治，旧势力的残余还程度不同地存在着，熏染和毒害着人们的灵魂。要实现人的思想革命化，要建成崭新的社会主义，并过渡到共产主义，就必须把这种旧势力的残余彻底铲除，把产生修正主义的根子连根拔掉，把资本主义复辟的门洞堵死，把旧社会遗留下来的一切垃圾打扫得干干净净。这是我们每个革命者毕生的战斗任务。
    革命小将红卫兵们，你们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，遵照毛主席的教导，以“只争朝夕”的积极革命精神，向“四旧”发动猛烈进攻，取得了显著成绩，这是毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利。你们这种争打头阵，勇于革命的精神，充分说明了你们不愧为毛主席身边的革命青年，不愧为革命的闯将。我们工农兵为有你们这样的战友而自豪。我们一定要和你们一起并肩战斗，向“四旧”发动最全面的最猛烈的进攻，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，不获全胜，永不收兵！
