	Japanese leaders of the "Japan Council against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs" violate the anti-American and anti-revisionist traditions, sparking strong opposition

	The International Preparatory Conference of the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs ends in a hurry

	The closing meeting has only a few foreign representatives and less than half of the Japanese representatives

	BEIJING, Aug. 4 (Xinhua) — The 12th World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs opened in Tokyo on July 30. Because some leaders of the Japan Council against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs (hereinafter referred to as "Japan Council") violated the traditions of the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, colluded with the Soviet modern revisionists who have been destroying the conference, and refused to accept the demand of foreign representatives to expel the representatives of the World Federation of Democratic Youth controlled by the current Soviet ruling clique, 32 representatives from 16 countries were forced to withdraw from the conference on Aug. 3.

	In the past, the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs has always held an international conference at the beginning of the World Conference. However, this year's conference suddenly changed the formal international conference to a so-called "International Preparatory Conference" and began to hold it on the morning of July 30. Foreign representatives attending the International Preparatory Conference include: Australia, Basutoland, Bechuanaland, Belgium, Brazil, Britain, Ceylon, Colombia, Denmark, France, Guyana, Korea (represented by Korean residents in Japan), Malaya, New Zealand, Panama, the Philippines, Romania, Sudan, Swaziland, the United States, a total of 20 countries, as well as the Permanent Secretariat of the Asian-African Legal Workers' Conference, the World Conference of Religious Leaders for Peace, the World Federation of Scientific Workers, the Executive Secretariat of the Asian-African-Latin American Solidarity Conference, and the World Esperanto Movement for Peace, a total of 5 international organizations, totaling 49 people.

	Japan Council representative director Hatanaka Masaharu gave a "general report" at the opening meeting on July 30. It is reported that various representatives demanded to discuss this so-called "general report," but the Japanese chairman suddenly announced at the meeting that this "general report" had been "approved and supported" by the conference, which surprised the foreign representatives.

	On August 1, the leaders of the Japan Council, disregarding everything, trampled on the glorious tradition of the Japan Council's opposition to American imperialism and its running dogs, and opposition to the Soviet revisionists' destructive and divisive activities. They openly announced to the conference the decision to invite the representative of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, Orlov (a Soviet), to attend the conference.

	As pointed out in the written statement issued by the majority of foreign representatives later, the World Federation of Democratic Youth is controlled by the "current Soviet ruling clique." "During the 10th World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, the World Federation of Democratic Youth, with evil intentions, took the lead in organizing a split conference, destroying the great movement of the people of various countries to oppose the nuclear blackmail, oppression, and aggressive policies of imperialism led by American imperialism in Japan and the world." Therefore, these foreign delegations firmly demanded the expulsion of the representatives of the World Federation of Democratic Youth from the conference.

	The leaders of the Japan Council refused to accept the legitimate demand of the majority of foreign representatives and, in the afternoon of the 2nd, forcibly announced the resumption of the conference. The only attendees were Japanese representatives and representatives of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, along with 17 foreign representatives.

	32 representatives from 16 countries were forced to leave the conference hall. It is reported that they sang the "Internationale" as they left the conference hall.

	Japan Council delegation leader Hirano Yoshitaro, in his report to the conference, defended the erroneous position of the Japan Council in violating the traditions of the past World Conference, arguing and distorting the facts, and talking about the so-called "united action." He said, "This is the correct way to inherit and develop the history and tradition of the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs." He did not mention the opposition to the Soviet modern revisionists, who are the running dogs of American imperialism, and their divisive activities.

	The statement issued by the majority of foreign representatives later pointed out that a genuine anti-American international united front must be established, "such a front can only be composed of those who are truly engaged in the anti-imperialist struggle, and cannot include the agents of imperialism, that is, the accomplices controlled by the current rulers of Moscow." The statement also clearly pointed out: "The slogan of 'united action' blurs the line between enemies and friends, and this slogan is intended to open the door to the enemy (including its disguised agents trying to infiltrate our ranks)."

	The statement of the 32 representatives from 16 countries was issued at a press conference at 5:30 a.m. on the 3rd. At 10 a.m. on the 3rd, these representatives held another press conference. Malaysian delegation leader Lee Sau Chu, on behalf of them, answered questions saying, "We have had no connection with the conference since we issued the statement today, so we will not go to Hiroshima and Nagasaki." He also said that the current "Japan Council" is no longer the "Japan Council" of the past, and if it does not make clear changes, the foreign representatives who issued the statement will not participate in the World Conference next year.

	On the morning of the 3rd, the International Preparatory Conference was held in a very embarrassing situation. Only 16 foreign representatives and less than half of the Japanese representatives attended the closing meeting.

	The Hiroshima and Nagasaki conferences of this World Conference are scheduled to be held on the 5th and 9th, respectively.

### 禁止原氢弹世界大会“国际预备会议”草草收场

    日本“禁原氢协”某些领导人违背反美反修传统激起强烈反对
    禁止原氢弹世界大会“国际预备会议”草草收场
    闭幕会议只有少数外国代表和不到半数的日本代表参加
    新华社四日讯　东京消息：第十二届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会七月三十日在东京开幕。由于日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会（简称“禁原氢协”）的某些领导人，违背禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的传统，同一向破坏大会的苏联现代修正主义勾结，拒绝外国代表提出的不许把“苏联现统治集团控制的世界民主青年联盟的代表团”塞进大会的要求，八月三日，十六国三十二名代表被迫宣布退出大会。
    过去禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的传统做法，都是在开头召开世界大会的国际会议，但是本届大会忽然把正式的国际会议改为所谓“国际预备会议”，并且从七月三十日上午开始举行。参加国际预备会议的外国代表有：澳大利亚、巴苏陀兰、贝专纳、比利时、巴西、英国、锡兰、哥伦比亚、丹麦、法国、圭亚那、朝鲜（由旅日朝侨担任）、马来亚、新西兰、巴拿马、菲律宾、罗马尼亚、苏丹、斯威士兰、美国共二十个国家的代表，以及亚非法律工作者会议常设书记处、争取和平世界宗教家会议、世界科学工作者协会、亚非拉人民团结大会执行书记处、世界和平世界语学家运动五个国际组织的代表共四十九人。
    日本“禁原氢协”代表理事畑中政春在三十日的开幕会议上作了“总报告”。据报道，对这个所谓“总报告”，各国代表要求加以讨论，但是主持会议的日本方面的主席团成员却突然在会上宣布，这个“总报告”已经得到会议的“批准和支持”，使外国代表感到惊讶。
    八月一日，日本“禁原氢协”领导人不顾一切地践踏了“禁原氢协”的反对美帝国主义及其走狗，反对苏联修正主义的破坏分裂活动的光荣传统，公然向会议宣布决定邀请世界民主青年联盟代表奥列尔（苏联人）出席会议。
    正象绝大多数外国代表后来发表的书面声明所指出的，世界民主青年联盟是受“苏联现统治集团控制的”。“在第十届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会期间，世界民主青年联盟怀着罪恶的目的，带头组织分裂会议，在日本和全世界破坏各国人民反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义的核讹诈、压迫和战争的侵略政策的伟大运动。”因此，这些外国代表团坚决要求把世界民主青年联盟代表驱逐出会议。
    日本“禁原氢协”领导人拒绝接受绝大多数外国代表的这个正当要求，并且在二日下午强行宣布复会。到会的除日本代表和世界民主青年联盟代表外，只有十七名外国代表。
    十六国三十二名代表被迫退出会场。据报道，他们在离开会议厅时，高唱《国际歌》。
    日本代表团团长平野义太郎在会议上作日本代表团报告时，为日本“禁原氢协”违背过去世界大会传统的错误立场辩解，强词夺理，大谈所谓“统一行动”。他说：“这才是正确地继承和发展禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的历史和传统”。他根本不提反对美帝国主义的帮凶苏联现代修正主义的分裂活动。
    绝大多数外国代表后来发表的声明指出，必须建立一个真正的反美国际统一战线，“这样一个战线只能由真正从事反帝斗争的人们组成，而不能包括帝国主义的代理人，即受莫斯科现统治者控制的同谋者。”声明还明确指出：“所谓‘统一行动’的口号模糊了敌友之间的界线，这个口号是打算向敌人（包括试图钻进我们的队伍的它的伪装的代理人）敞开大门。”
    十六国三十二名代表的这个声明，是在三日清晨五时半在记者招待会上发表的。三日上午十时，这些代表再次举行记者招待会。马来亚代表团团长李绍祖代表他们答复问题说：“我们从今天发表声明时起已经同大会没有关系，因此长崎、广岛都不去了。”他又说，现在的“禁原氢协”已经不是过去的“禁原氢协”，如果它不作出明确改变，发表声明的外国代表明年也不参加世界大会。
    三日上午，国际预备会议在十分尴尬的情况下举行了闭幕会。只有十六名外国代表和不到半数的日本代表参加了闭幕会。
    这次世界大会的广岛大会和长崎大会预定分别在五日和九日举行。
