NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, TIRANA, August 9 -- The Secretary-General of the Albanian Veterans' Association, Vilel Dedja, and the member of the Albanian Peace Committee and famous historian Yusuf Alibali, warmly hail the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, for swimming in the Yangtze River.

Dedja said: "Hearing that Comrade Mao Zedong swam in the Yangtze River, proving that he is very healthy, we are very happy. We wish him to live as long as the mountains of Albania, forever. Comrade Mao Zedong, at such an advanced age, swimming so far and so long in the river, is a great inspiration for us old veterans, making us feel young again, and we are determined to work and fight even better."

This old veteran passionately said: "'Chairman Mao crosses the Yangtze River' is itself a revolutionary slogan. It tells us that revolutionary communists and revolutionary people, regardless of age, must always have a revolutionary spirit, overcome all difficulties, and forge ahead bravely."

    戴迪说：“听到毛泽东同志畅游长江，证明他很健康，我们非常高兴。我们愿他象阿尔巴尼亚的高山一样，万寿无疆。毛泽东同志那样的高龄还在江河里游那么远那么久，这对我们老战士来说，是个莫大的鼓舞，使我们都感到年青了，并决心更好地劳动和战斗。”
    这位老战士激情地说：“‘毛主席横渡长江’这句话本身就是一句革命的名言。它告诉我们革命的共产党员、革命的人民，不论年龄大小，要永远以革命的精神，排除万难，勇往直前。”
    著名历史学家阿利巴利说：“毛主席畅游长江不是一件小事，我十分钦佩他的坚强意志，和他在政治上体力上的顽强精神。”
