The Daqing Oilfield is a model of how to run an enterprise with the spirit and style of the PLA.

Early this year, I visited an advanced oil extraction team at the Daqing Oilfield. It happened that the team members had just returned from learning from the stationed troops. I asked them what experiences they had gained. A young female deputy well chief said, “They study Chairman Mao’s works with the principle of ‘no thought, no learning’!” A deputy team leader added, “Learn and apply!”

“No thought, no learning!” and “Learn and apply!” These two sentences hit the nail on the head and grasp the essence. This is precisely the fundamental characteristic of the PLA’s study of Chairman Mao’s works: active learning and application, focusing on the “apply” aspect, and first applying it to the transformation of one’s subjective world.

“No thought, no learning!” This means that studying Chairman Mao’s works must be used to transform one’s thoughts. The purpose of studying Mao Zedong Thought is to use it to transform our subjective and objective worlds. People are the decisive factor. Only by striving to transform our subjective world can we better transform the objective world. Mao’s good soldier Wang Jie said that studying Chairman Mao’s works is for “transforming thoughts, guiding work, analyzing and handling real problems.” If one “does not touch thoughts, does not connect with work, and does not apply,” then one cannot talk about any learning effect. He put the transformation of his own thoughts first, which is completely correct. Think about it: how can someone whose thoughts are not revolutionary do a good job in participating in the revolution to transform the objective world?

“No thought, no learning!” This means that in the process of studying Chairman Mao’s works, we must use Mao Zedong Thought to examine and check our thoughts, put our thoughts forward, and expose them. Without this, even if one studies, one cannot achieve results; it would not count as learning.

“Learn and apply.” This sentence follows closely after “no thought, no learning.” Some comrades, when studying Chairman Mao’s works, although they can expose their thoughts, often only see the “exposure” and not the “transformation,” resulting in not being able to learn it well. After exposing one’s thoughts, one should follow up with “transformation,” using Chairman Mao’s thoughts as a weapon to overcome the non-proletarian thoughts in one’s mind. Heroes like Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Liu Yingjun, and others were able to master Mao Zedong Thought precisely because they “learn and apply”!

“No thought, no learning!” and “Learn and apply!” This PLA company studies Chairman Mao’s works well!

This company is just an ordinary company in the PLA. From a drop of water, one can see the sun. From this ordinary company, can we not see the whole PLA’s situation of studying Chairman Mao’s works? We cannot help but think of the shining names of Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Ou Yanghai, Mai Xiande, and Liu Yingjun. Why can the PLA continuously produce a large number of heroes? Why can the PLA achieve a highly proletarian and highly combat-ready status? Because they are an army armed with Mao Zedong Thought, because they, through actively learning and applying Chairman Mao’s works, have mastered Mao Zedong Thought, this most powerful weapon.

The PLA, personally created and led by Chairman Mao, is a great army. This army is our model for learning!

    “不见思想不算学”
    ——向解放军学习
    辛午
    大庆油田是以解放军的精神、作风办企业的模范。
    今年年初，我访问过大庆油田的一个先进采油队，正好这个队的职工从驻军那里学习回来。我问他们学到了什么经验。一个年轻的女副井长说：“他们学习毛主席著作是不见思想不算学！”一个副队长接着说：“学了就用！”
      “不见思想不算学！”“学了就用！”这两句话，说到了点子上，抓住了要领，这正是解放军学习毛主席著作的根本特点：活学活用，在“用”字上狠下功夫，首先用在改造自己的主观世界上。
      “不见思想不算学！”这就是说，学习毛主席著作一定要用来改造自己的思想。学习毛泽东思想的目的，是为了用它来改造我们的主观世界和客观世界。人是决定的因素，只有努力改造自己的主观世界，才能更好地去改造客观世界。毛主席的好战士王杰说，学习毛主席著作，是为了“改造思想，指导工作，分析和处理现实问题”；如果“偏偏不接触思想，不联系工作，不去运用，那就谈不上什么学习收效”。他把改造自己的思想放在首位，这是完全正确的。试想：一个思想没有革命化的人，怎么会很好地去参加改造客观世界的革命呢？
      “不见思想不算学！”这就是说，在我们学习毛主席著作的过程中，一定要用毛泽东思想来对照、检查我们的思想，把我们的思想摆进去，亮出来。没有这一条，学了也不能取得效果，只能是“不算学”。
      “学了就用。”这句话又是紧跟着“不见思想不算学”的。有的同志，学习毛主席著作时，虽然也能够亮一亮自己的思想，但是往往光见其“亮”，不见其
  “改”，结果也还是学不到手。亮了思想后，就应该紧跟着“改”，以毛主席的思想为武器，来战胜自己头脑里的非无产阶级思想。雷锋、王杰、刘英俊等等英雄人物，所以能把毛泽东思想学到手，就在于他们“学了就用”！
      “不见思想不算学！”“学了就用！”这个解放军连队学习毛主席著作学得好！
    这个连队，只是解放军中一个普通的连队。从一滴水看太阳，由这个普通的连队，何尝不能想见整个解放军学习毛主席著作的情况呢？我们不禁想起了雷锋、王杰、欧阳海、麦贤得、刘英俊这些闪闪发光的名字。为什么解放军能不断涌现大批英雄人物？为什么解放军能做到非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化？因为他们是毛泽东思想武装起来的军队，因为他们通过活学活用毛主席著作，掌握了毛泽东思想这个最强大的武器。
    毛主席亲自创建和领导的中国人民解放军，是一支伟大的军队。这支军队是我们学习的榜样！
