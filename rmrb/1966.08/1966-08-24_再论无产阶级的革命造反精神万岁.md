The principles of Marxism are numerous, but ultimately, they boil down to one sentence: "Rebellion is justified." ... Based on this principle, we rebel, we struggle, and we build socialism.

In the past, workers overthrew capitalists, peasants overthrew landlords, and the exploiting classes labeled this as rebellion. The hat of rebellion worn by the proletariat is indeed glorious!

Today, have all the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits that give rise to revisionism been completely eliminated?

No!

Have the black lines and black gangs in various places and units been completely eliminated?

No!

If we eliminate the black lines and black gangs now, will new black lines and black gangs not emerge in the future?

No!

Have imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries been eliminated?

No! No! No!

In this situation, can the proletariat not rebel? How can the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat's rebellion not be long-lived?

The bourgeois rightists, this group of rebels, has leadership, weapons, organization, and "ambitions." They are not to be taken lightly.

Our leadership is the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao!

Our weapons are the invincible great thought of Mao Zedong!

Our organization is the thoroughly revolutionary Red Guards!

Our "ambition" is to sweep away all monsters and demons!

It is easy to shake the mountains, but it is difficult to shake the Red Guards!

Bourgeois rightists, we understand your special feelings: you have been suppressed by us, you are in pain, and you also want to shout "rebellion." No wonder there has been a recent phenomenon of both leftists and rightists shouting "rebellion." Frankly, pearls do not allow fish eyes to mix in. We only allow the leftists to rebel, not the rightists! If you dare to rebel, we will immediately suppress you! This is our logic. After all, the state machinery is in our hands.

Long live the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat's rebellion!

    再论无产阶级的革命造反精神万岁
    马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：“造反有理。”……根据这个道理，于是就反抗，就斗争，就干社会主义。
                                                ——毛泽东
    过去，工人打倒资本家，农民打倒地主，剥削阶级诬之为造反。无产阶级造反的帽子真是光荣得很！
    今天，旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯等等产生修正主义的东西，都完全消灭了吗？
    没有！
    各地各单位的黑线黑帮现在都完全消灭了吗？
    没有！
    现在消灭了黑线黑帮，将来就不会产生新的黑线黑帮吗？
    不是！
    帝国主义，现代修正主义和一切反动派都消灭了吗？
    没有！没有！！没有！！！
    在这种情况下，我们无产阶级能不造反吗？无产阶级的革命造反精神怎么能不万岁呢？
    资产阶级的右派先生们，我们这群造反之众，有领导，有武器，有组织，有“野心”，来头不小，切不可等闲视之。
    我们的领导是党中央和毛主席！
    我们的武器是战无不胜的伟大的毛泽东思想！
    我们的组织是彻底革命的红卫兵！
    我们的“野心”是横扫一切牛鬼蛇神！
    撼山易，撼红卫兵难！
    资产阶级的右派先生们，我们很理解你们的特殊心情：你们被我们专政了，你们痛苦了，你们也想喊一声“造反”了。无怪乎，最近出现了左派、右派齐喊造反的怪现象。老实告诉你们，珍珠不容鱼目来混杂。我们只许左派造反，不许右派造反！你们胆敢造反，我们就立即镇压！这就是我们的逻辑。反正国家机器在我们手里。
      无产阶级的革命造反精神万岁！
