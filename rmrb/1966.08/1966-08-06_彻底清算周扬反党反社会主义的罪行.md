Thoroughly Settle Accounts with Zhou Yang's Anti-Party, Anti-Socialist Crimes

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the literary and artistic circles have always had an anti-party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought black line. The reason why the literary and artistic circles have been in turmoil for more than a decade and have basically not implemented the party's policies is because this black line has been causing trouble. And the reason why this black line can cause trouble is because in the leadership of literary and artistic work, the bourgeoisie has taken control of our politics, and there is a root cause.

Who is this root cause? It is Zhou Yang, the former vice-minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. He used his authority to control many literary and artistic departments, monopolize many publishing platforms, and could mobilize organizational forces and create public opinion in the literary circles. In this way, their activities have had a great impact and caused great harm.

Some people may have doubts: Isn't Zhou Yang the "authoritative interpreter" of Mao Zedong's thoughts on literature and art for many years? Didn't he organize the struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and the rightists such as Ding Ling and Chen Qiying? How could such a person become the root cause of the black line? In fact, all this is a myth fabricated by Zhou Yang and his accomplices, a big fraud.

Since the founding of the nation, all the struggles in the literary and artistic circles, such as the criticism of "Wu Xun's Biography," the criticism of "Research on 'Dream of the Red Chamber,'" the criticism of Hu Shi, and the struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and the rightists such as Ding Ling, Chen Qiying, and others, were all led directly by the Central Committee of the Party and Chairman Mao. While Zhou Yang stood on the anti-party, anti-socialist position, either openly or secretly, advocating for the bourgeoisie and revisionism, fanning the flames, and actively promoting a revisionist line of literature and art, systematically opposing Mao Zedong Thought.

The complexity of the problem lies in the fact that Zhou Yang is a typical cunning and deceitful hypocrite and opportunist.

He is accustomed to using the "red flag" to oppose the red flag. On the surface, he supports Mao Zedong Thought, but behind the scenes, he defames Mao Zedong Thought; in large meetings, he supports Mao Zedong Thought, but in small meetings, he attacks Mao Zedong Thought.

He is accustomed to using conciliatory language, an expert in writing "but" articles. His articles and speeches have a prominent feature: first, he comes up with an abstract and seemingly correct argument, and then immediately writes a counter-argument after "but." His method of discussing issues is precisely the method used by all revisionists, ambiguous and vague, both this and that, mixing up concepts that are fundamentally opposed, thus confusing the boundaries between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, Marxism and revisionism, socialism and capitalism, and peddling revisionist black goods.

He is accustomed to changing with the wind, like a chameleon, changing his color at any time. When the rightists were rampant, he would fan the flames and attack the party together; when the counterattack against the rightists began, he would disguise himself as a leftist, give speeches, write articles, and adorn himself, taking credit for the work of others; when the struggle deepened and was about to touch him, he would adopt the tactic of sacrificing the troops to save the general to extricate himself.

Therefore, in recognizing Zhou Yang, we must not be deceived by his surface appearance.

Now, this leader of the black line in the literary and artistic circles, who has been hiding in the party for decades, has been exposed. Below, we will look at the evil deeds that Zhou Yang has committed in recent years.

1. Maliciously Attacking Mao Zedong Thought, Opposing the Party's Leadership of Literature and Art

Mao Zedong Thought is the creative, comprehensive, and systematic development of Marxism-Leninism in the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards global victory. It is the sole correct guideline for the various stages of our revolution and is a powerful revolutionary ideological weapon for oppressed peoples and oppressed nations to oppose imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries. Mao Zedong is the greatest banner-bearer of the international communist movement in contemporary times and the most beloved leader of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world. Supporting or opposing Mao Zedong Thought, supporting or opposing Mao Zedong, is the dividing line between Marxism and revisionism, revolution and counter-revolution. As the vice-minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Zhou Yang not only does not propagate Mao Zedong Thought, does not call on literary and artistic workers to strive to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and does not advocate that literary works strive to reflect Mao Zedong Thought, but openly opposes the propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought in literature and art, and maliciously attacks Mao Zedong Thought.

Mao Zedong published "On New Democracy" in 1940, "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" in 1942, and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and "Speech at the National Conference on Propaganda Work" in 1957. These works have brilliantly developed Marxist literary theory, proposed the most complete, most thorough, and most correct line of literature and art, and solved the fundamental problem of aesthetics. However, Zhou Yang arrogantly attempted to establish his own aesthetic system. In 1958, he gave a lecture titled "Building Marxist Aesthetics" at Peking University and planned to give a series of lectures with his accomplices Lin Mochuan and Shaoyanlin to promote their bourgeois reactionary thoughts to counter Chairman Mao's great teachings.

Zhou Yang has always opposed the party's leadership of literature and art. He attacks the party's leadership of literary and artistic work as "interference" and "monopoly." He wants us to jointly lead literature and art with non-party members. In the 1961 propaganda department's symposium on party members and artistic cadres of the Changchun Film Studio, he said: "You cooperate with non-party members, isn't that joint leadership?... Never develop to the point of recklessness, you lead through party and non-party experts, that is leadership. The party's leadership is overall leadership, specific departments should be jointly led, right!" He thinks that too many party member artistic cadres are a disaster, so he proposed: "Your (referring to Changchun Film Studio) artistic cadres have too few non-party members, which is also a shortcoming. Should we transfer a few from Shanghai to your place to take up deputy positions, to adjust and balance, I really think so." In 1962, he incited at the Changchun drama actors' symposium: "For each of us, we should cultivate the ability to do good work under good leadership and also do good work under bad leadership.... Under particularly bad leadership, we should cultivate this ability." Here, he refers to the leadership of the party committee as "bad" leadership. Soon after, he talked to the Liaoning literary and artistic circles and said: "Artistic creation is also like a doctor performing surgery, the leader's responsibility is to choose a good doctor, whether to operate successfully or not is left to him, and he is responsible." He opposes the combination of leadership, writers, and the masses in artistic creation, maliciously distorting this "three-in-one combination" as "leadership provides ideas, the masses provide life, and writers provide the pen." After he himself defamed the "three-in-one combination," he mocked it, saying: "Is writing so easy? What do we need writers for? Then train a large number of secretaries, all of whom can write, you speak, and I will write, and after writing, the masses will supplement the life, then what do we need writers for. What is precious about writers?" From the above facts, it can be seen that Zhou Yang has been scheming to incite literary and artistic workers to detach themselves from and oppose the party's leadership.

Not only that, he also uses ancient events to criticize modern ones, using metaphorical language to vent his inner hatred towards various levels of party committees. In the 1961 national feature film creation conference, he said: "Several hundred years later, people will look at our party members serving organizational discipline just as we look at Yue Fei serving the emperor. Why did a few gold plaques call him back, they will not understand why we hold meetings to struggle so hard, why we are so timid, afraid of the 'border area'." He also incited, saying: "Comrades use the word 'border,' there is deep meaning in it! One wrong step and you fall into the rightist abyss, anti-party abyss, right-opportunist abyss, revisionist abyss. There are too many abysses, once you fall in, you will be doomed." Obviously, this is slandering our party, slandering the party and state leaders, and slandering proletarian dictatorship.

Everyone knows that the Central Committee of the Party, led by Chairman Mao, is a model of democratic centralism. All policies and guidelines are formulated from the masses and returned to the masses. In our country, a unique political situation has emerged where there is both concentration and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unity of will and individual comfort. The vast majority of the population, workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals, have become the masters of the state, each with their heads held high and their hearts open. Ask yourself: Under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, who is afraid of falling into the rightist abyss, anti-party abyss, right-opportunist abyss, and revisionist abyss? It can only be landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, only those who secretly harbor anti-party and anti-socialist sentiments while pretending to support the party and socialism. As for the literary and artistic cause, it is a component of the proletarian revolutionary cause and must accept the absolute leadership of the party. Zhou Yang has gone to great lengths to oppose the party's leadership of the literary and artistic cause. What kind of person he is, is it not clear?

2. Peddling the Bourgeois Theory of Human Nature, Opposing Marxist Class Theory

Class perspective is a fundamental perspective of Marxism. Acknowledging the existence of classes and consciously struggling for the revolutionary cause of the proletariat is the minimum condition for a Marxist. Similarly, acknowledging the class principle of literature and art, that is, acknowledging that literature and art serve a certain class, and consciously making literature and art serve the proletarian politics, serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, is the minimum condition for a Marxist literary and artistic worker. Mao Zedong said in "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art":

"The question of whom to serve is a fundamental question, a question of principle." He also said: "In the present world, all culture or literature and art belong to a certain class and a certain political line. Art for art's sake, classless art, and art that is parallel or independent of politics, do not exist in reality." This question has been made very clear. However, Zhou Yang said, "The beautiful things of humanity are objectively existent." In this way, he denies the class nature of "beauty." Not only that, Zhou Yang also said that our current literature is "popular literature." Khrushchev advocated "all-people's party" and "all-people's state," while Zhou Yang advocated "all-people's literature." Obviously, Zhou Yang and Khrushchev are singing the same tune.

Zhou Yang hates the class perspective and strives to eliminate the class nature of literature and art. In the 1961 national feature film creation conference, he said: "In the debate on human nature, we need to carry out a two-front struggle, on the one hand, we oppose bourgeois human nature, on the other hand, we oppose our labelism.... Labelism is to stick a class label on everything, saying this is bourgeois, that is proletarian, as if people are incarnations of class, only having class nature." Here, he said "opposing bourgeois human nature" is a feint, what he actually attacks is the class nature of literature and art. This can be seen from another passage in his speech: "The relationship between resonance and class nature is not great, the art of any class is not only for its own class to see, it is for all classes to see, to resonate with all people, whether it resonates or not is another matter. Therefore, artistic works can be accepted by any class, a work produced by a class cannot only be enjoyed by its own class, otherwise this work is a failure." He then said: "Some works reflect the interests of a class and also reflect the interests of all the people." Here, he wants the proletariat to resonate with bourgeois literature and art, to appreciate bourgeois literature and art, isn't this saying that the proletariat and the bourgeoisie have a common human nature? He has not criticized human nature at all, on the contrary, he has fervently advocated human nature and opposed class theory.

Zhou Yang's praise of "humanism" is also very enthusiastic. In the aforementioned lecture at Peking University, he said, "Our humanism is the most thorough." He often talks about "popularity." This so-called popularity is another name for humanism. In his report at the 1956 national drama repertoire work conference, he said: "The popularity in drama is very rich, do not look at it with a narrow-minded view, thinking that the rulers have no popularity. The rulers also have popularity. Like Qiu Zhong, Bao Zheng, etc., they are the ruling class, and Bao Zheng's official position is very high, but he is good to the people, the people have placed many ideals on him, therefore from here we can see many expressions of the people's wishes. The advantage of Chinese drama is that it is more popular than other literary works." Zhou Yang equates proletarian literature and art with the most thorough humanistic literature and art, and equates feudal rulers with popularity, which is a blatant denial of class contradictions and the advocacy of class reconciliation.

Zhou Yang's propaganda of the so-called "common" political ethics between the exploiting class and the exploited class, "common" human nature, "common" emotions, and the negation of the Marxist class perspective of the bourgeoisie, can also be seen in many of his reports and speeches. He claims that "people always tend towards justice, towards fairness," that all great writers "want their works to serve humanity," and so on. Chairman Mao pointed out more than twenty years ago that in class society, there is only class human nature, not classless human nature. However, Zhou Yang is talking about the "commonality" between enemy classes, talking about "serving humanity," isn't this clearly opposing Mao Zedong Thought?

3. Defending Modern Revisionism, Attacking Marxism-Leninism

Modern revisionism is the main danger in the current communist movement. This was pointed out clearly by Chairman Mao in his 1957 work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and further elaborated in the continuous anti-revisionist articles issued by the Central Committee of the Party. However, Zhou Yang, in the 1960 symposium on the work of the philosophy and social sciences research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: "Revisionist academic thought is not the main thing in China... because: first, we opposed Hu Feng, criticized the rightists, revisionism is not easy to rise; second, Chinese revisionism is much worse than foreign revisionism...; third, revisionism has just emerged, it has not had the opportunity to develop greatly, because it has just emerged, it is easy to eliminate it, so we have to temporarily cultivate revisionism! True revisionism still needs a set of theories!" Here, Zhou Yang specially praises revisionism as having a set of so-called "theories" and believes that we need to "temporarily cultivate revisionism" to oppose revisionism in our country. This is truly absurd nonsense! Zhou Yang also spared no effort to defend Soviet revisionism. In his report at the 1963 literary and artistic work conference, he said: "Revisionism desperately talks about human feelings, we will sing a counter-song to it, we will not talk about human feelings, you talk about equality, I will not talk about equality, you talk about peace, I will not talk about peace, you talk about labor, I will not talk about labor, we will stand in opposition. We should not do such stupid things." Here, Zhou Yang deliberately creates confusion and mixes right and wrong. When did revisionism truly emphasize "labor"? When have we had the incident of "not talking about labor"? Zhou Yang defends revisionism to such a vicious extent!

More seriously, after we had issued eight articles criticizing the open letter of the Central Committee of the CPSU in 1964, Zhou Yang was still shouting in the 1964 May symposium on modern history that "we need to study the anti-revisionist issue well, do not be too hasty, because it is not a practical issue." This is sheer nonsense. Revisionism is the capitalist ideology disguised in Marxist-Leninist phrases, it is right-opportunist ideology. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that class struggle exists in socialist society. The main contradiction in socialist society is the struggle between two classes and two roads. Using revisionist ideology to corrupt cadres and the masses and carry out peaceful evolution is one of the main ways the bourgeoisie fights against the proletariat. Zhou Yang says that anti-revisionism is not a practical issue, which is to advocate the theory of the extinction of class struggle, to make us lose vigilance against the main danger of "peaceful evolution," to let us allow modern revisionist ideology to spread, in order to facilitate the restoration of capitalism.

Zhou Yang is so fond of revisionism, but he hates so-called "dogmatism." At the 8th National Congress of the Party, he loudly advocated anti-dogmatism. He said: "The dogmatism in our literature and art today is mainly manifested in the vulgarization and simplification of Marxist aesthetic views, and the formulation of many rigid 'rules and regulations' for literary creation, which restricts the hands and feet of writers and artists. Dogmatism combined with sectarianism has caused harm to the development of literature and art." In the 1962 discussion on the "Outline of Literary Theory," he hypocritically said a sentence "the viewpoint should be infused with anti-revisionism" and then said: "On the other hand, although it is not necessarily to publicly advocate anti-dogmatism, it is actually to oppose it, to oppose its elimination of artistic characteristics." Here, Zhou Yang's opposition to "dogmatism" is precisely Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

Zhou Yang is so perverse!

4. Advocating the Bourgeois Line of Literature and Art, Opposing Literature and Art Serving the Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers

In his publicly published articles and some speeches, Zhou Yang sometimes also mentions the issue of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, serving socialism. But this is just a cover, a disguise. In fact, Zhou Yang is using the most concentrated firepower and the most systematic theory to oppose the direction proposed by Chairman Mao of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, serving socialism.

He uses the opposition to the "theme determines" theory to oppose writers writing about workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to oppose reflecting socialism. Zhou Yang said that major themes are not necessarily "major political events," but are "themes that can attract everyone's attention and interest and are beneficial to everyone"; he also said, "do not let the leadership advocate what to write"; he also said, "modern themes still start from the 'May Fourth Movement'." These propositions are all the same, that is, writers can write about workers, peasants, and soldiers, but they can also write about the bourgeoisie, landlords, rich peasants, emperors, and ministers; they can write about major political struggles, but they can also write about trivial matters, flowers, snow, moon, and personal affairs; they can write about socialist revolution, but they can also write about ancient legends, old country stories, and foreign landscapes. Everyone knows that the issue of themes is related to who is the protagonist of our socialist literature and art, and what is the theme of our socialist literature and art. Works with workers, peasants, and soldiers as protagonists and works with landlords and the bourgeoisie as protagonists cannot be compared; works with the stormy socialist revolution as the theme and works with personal trivial matters as the theme cannot be treated equally. To compare these is to open the way for feudalism and capitalism, to oppose reflecting workers, peasants, and soldiers, to oppose praising socialism, and to oppose literature and art serving proletarian politics.

Zhou Yang proposed a theory of "indirect cooperation." In his 1959 lecture at Peking University "Literature and Politics," he said: "When we talk about literature serving politics, we must prevent, correct, and rectify another simplified method, that is, to simply understand literature serving politics as propaganda for every specific political movement and every specific policy." In the 1961 literary and artistic work symposium, he said: "Direct cooperation and indirect cooperation are both serving politics." It should be pointed out that politics is not an abstract thing. Proletarian politics must be embodied in specific proletarian policies and specific proletarian political movements. If literature does not propagate specific policies and specific political movements, literature serving proletarian politics becomes an empty slogan. Zhou Yang advocates the theory of "indirect cooperation," which is to lead literature away from proletarian politics.

Why can't literature propagate specific policies and political movements? Zhou Yang borrowed the excuse of different times. In the 1956 national drama repertoire work conference, he said: "Now we need to solve the needs of people's culture, which is different from the revolutionary war period. In the special situation of revolutionary war, we need to use drama to propagate and incite, to cooperate with the task, so there are performances like 'Mobilize to Join the Army,' 'Send Grain to the Front,' 'Disband the Enemy Army,' etc., as political incitement. Now we are in the era of peaceful construction, we are building socialism, people need spiritual food of socialism, the situation is different. The past propaganda and incitement plays, performed in the wild, everyone came to watch, watched and then went to the front line; now they are performed in large theaters, the audience all have to buy tickets, and they have to queue up to buy tickets, if the play is not good, they won't come, so we must have some skills. Therefore, we now need to propose that the repertoire should be good, diverse, and meet the needs of the masses." He here opposes the plays that reflect the political requirements of the time, such as "Mobilize to Join the Army," and the so-called "good plays," and reduces the good or bad of the plays to box office value! Correspondingly, he also proposed the "four good films" slogan, that is, "good story, good actors, good shots, good music," that is, no good politics, no good ideology. Look, in Zhou Yang's mind, in the socialist era, literature and art do not need to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, proletarian politics! In this way, the literary and artistic activities we advocate today, such as going to the countryside and the "Wulan Muqi" style of literary and artistic activities, are not in line with the requirements of the times. Isn't this absurd to the extreme!

Zhou Yang, under the pretext of studying the relationship between Chinese and foreign classical writers and politics, advocated the theory that "art for art's sake is not necessarily reactionary." This is also to lead literature and art away from proletarian politics and serve bourgeois politics. For this purpose, Zhou Yang also advocated making a lot of slapstick films. In the 1961 literary and artistic work symposium, he said: "Now life is already very tense, don't make it so tense when watching a play... we need to make some relaxing and pleasant things, we can make a lot of comedy films, make a lot of slapstick films." After 1961, films like "Ball Fan" and "Big Li, Small Li, and Old Li" appeared, which were the evil results of Zhou Yang's theory.

In line with the above theory, Zhou Yang also created a theory of "harmless" literature and art. Zhou Yang divides literature and art into three categories: beneficial, harmless, and harmful. "So-called harmless is politically harmless, but in life it is still beneficial. For example, the opera 'A Dream Under the Southern Bough' and landscape paintings belong to this category." Is there such a third kind of literature and art in the world that does not belong to any class politically? Just from the examples he gave, "A Dream Under the Southern Bough" is it not a play that propagates feudal superstition and the ghost of talented scholars and beautiful women? Is it "harmless"? Zhou Yang is indeed a leader of literature and art in the 1930s, and he has brought in the black goods of the so-called third kind of literature and art that some people advocated at that time!

5. Inciting Literary and Artistic Workers to Reject Ideological Remolding, Persisting in the Bourgeois Reactionary Position

How can literary and artistic workers truly serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, serve socialism? The most fundamental way is to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, to go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly, to thoroughly remold their worldview, to make their thoughts truly proletarianized, and to obtain rich creative sources from the struggles and lives of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. This path has been clearly indicated by Chairman Mao a long time ago. However, for such a revolutionary path, Zhou Yang is opposed to and hates it. In his reports and speeches, he does not emphasize literary and artistic workers studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and does not seriously advocate literary and artistic workers combining with the workers, peasants, and soldiers to remold their worldview; occasionally mentioning it, it is only to use deepening life as a means to collect creative materials. On the contrary, Zhou Yang is actually opposed to writers remolding their worldview in practice. He advocates not "hanging worldview on the mouth," he thinks "everything is politics, everything is worldview," is "vulgarizing worldview." He advocates "not expressing the times, not anti-revolution is also allowed." He calls for: "Modern themes and historical themes can all be written. Writers can write according to their own experience, write what they are familiar with, interested in, and confident in." His advocacy is a replica of the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng's "life is everywhere."

In 1962, China suffered temporary difficulties due to three years of natural disasters and the betrayal of revisionism. It was precisely in this year that Zhou Yang and his gang held a symposium in Dalian and launched a large number of poisonous arrows attacking the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes. At this meeting, Zhou Yang incited writers to oppose the party's policies and advocated the so-called "write truth" theory. He said: "Views that differ from the party can be temporarily not written. Be loyal to life, loyal to truth, loyal to objective things." This is a vicious anti-party black talk! Revolutionary writers sometimes have the situation of not keeping up with the party's policies, but this is not the same as what Zhou Yang advocates. Zhou Yang opposes the party's policies and "life," "truth," "objective things," which means that their views are in line with the reality of life, in line with the truth; while the party's policies are wrong, not in line with the reality of life. Zhou Yang advocates this, which is actually to incite writers to write anti-party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds and to open the way for the bourgeoisie to restore power. At this meeting, the theory of "writing middle characters" and other anti-party and anti-socialist statements were also thrown out. Zhou Yang proudly wanted them to write works exposing the so-called "dark side" of our country, saying that such novels "open up all the contradictions, I think it can be very interesting!" Zhou Yang and his black gang's advocacy of the "write truth" theory and the "write middle characters" theory, what kind of goods are they, isn't it very clear?

Regarding the guidance of writers' creation, Comrade Mao Zedong proposed the policy of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism (generally called the method of creation, but this should be said as the guiding policy for writers' creation), that is, the works of proletarian writers should be based on real life, but also written under the guidance of socialist and communist ideals. Such works not only reflect real life but also infuse the ideal of encouraging people to build and defend socialism and actively struggle for communism, thereby educating the broad masses of readers and making literature and art truly become a powerful weapon to promote the proletarian cause. This principle is a new creation of Marxist literary thought. Every revolutionary writer should unhesitatingly implement this writing policy. However, as the leader of the party's literary and artistic work, how did Zhou Yang treat this policy? In the 1961 national feature film creation conference, he said: "How to embody romanticism and realism? The constitutions of the Writers' Association and the Dramatists' Association do not stipulate, you can do as you like, if you are happy to embody it, embody it, if you are not happy to embody it, do not embody it." Here, Zhou Yang and his gang are so arrogant that they place the Writers' Association, Dramatists' Association, and other organizations they control above the party and above Comrade Mao Zedong, openly refusing to implement Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions.

Zhou Yang, in order to provide a platform for anti-party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds, also advocated opening a "free market for literature and art." He said: "I think we can publish internal publications, and 'five nots,' write freely, and it is possible to produce good works. This internal publication is first works, second is to discuss issues, including those that disagree with the party's policies, those that cannot be publicly published in newspapers, the free market for literature and art." It is very clear that this so-called "free market for literature and art" is an underground publication against the party and against socialism, a black market. The works published in this publication must be cold arrows and dark arrows shot at the party and socialism. This publication is a counter-revolutionary tool of the Chinese Petofi Club. Zhou Yang wanted to set up such a publication to gather those who reject ideological remolding, anti-party, and anti-socialist writers under his black flag, in order to accumulate strength, sharpen weapons, and carry out organized counter-revolutionary restoration activities.

6. Distorting the Party's "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" Class Policy, Advocating Bourgeois Liberalization

The "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy proposed by the party is a policy to develop proletarian literature, art, and academic thought; the purpose of implementing this policy is to establish and flourish socialist culture. Over the past decade, Zhou Yang has almost invariably talked about "the Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" at every meeting, but almost without exception, every time he has distorted this policy as unconditional. At the literary and artistic work conference held in 1956, he said: "It should be 'Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom' first, all national traditions should be developed, and then new things should be produced on this basis." This means that regardless of whether the content of the works is feudalism or capitalism, they can all be freely released. He criticized: "Now although no one openly advocates 'One Flower Blooms Alone, One School Prevails,' in essence he adopts 'One Flower Blooms Alone, One School Prevails.' From the surface, it seems that he is fast. He excludes all non-socialist things, he makes socialist culture quickly occupy the position. From the surface, it seems fast, but in fact the effect is very slow. Because he excludes those old things, his socialist culture cannot get nutrition; without competition, he cannot absorb things from old experts and old seniors, and he makes himself dry" (emphasis added by the translator). Zhou Yang thinks that the source of socialist culture is not the socialist revolution and construction practiced by the broad masses, but the old culture, old experts, and old artists. He openly advocates the "peaceful competition" of Khrushchev in the cultural field.

Zhou Yang complains that others do not promote his so-called "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools." At the 1961 symposium on educational issues, he said: "Some comrades published revisionist articles in newspapers and should make a self-criticism, but they did not make a self-criticism for violating the 'Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools'... and no one asked him to make a self-criticism." In this way, he not only blamed that no one asked for a self-criticism for violating the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools," but also, by contrast, called for sympathy for those who wrote revisionist articles and made self-criticisms. "Like attracts like, like seeks like," what Zhou Yang harbors in his heart naturally comes out.

Zhou Yang is so enthusiastic about his so-called "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools," what is his true purpose? In the April 1963 literary and artistic work conference, he had an explanation: "In the market of ideology, we should estimate not only the creation of modern artists but also the things left by the ancients. Spiritual food includes one is ours new, one is ancient, one is foreign, things from the 18th and 19th centuries, these all circulate in the cultural market." It turns out that in addition to running a "black market," Zhou Yang also wants to openly open a free market in the cultural field, to turn the socialist cultural position into a "three-thirds" coexistence of us and "foreigners" and "dead people."

Chairman Mao pointed out when proposing the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy, he formulated six political standards as the basis for distinguishing between fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds. The party's leadership is to nurture fragrant flowers, eliminate poisonous weeds, nurture new things, and oppose decaying things. However, Zhou Yang never emphasizes the party's leadership and the six standards, but vigorously advocates "in our literary and artistic garden, all that is blooming is flowers"; and proposes a strange proposition, saying "the freedom of artistic creation and academic discussion must be guaranteed, guaranteeing these is guaranteeing the party's leadership." This means that allowing all feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism to spread freely is "guaranteeing the party's leadership." In this way, he fundamentally denies the struggle to promote the proletariat and eliminate the bourgeoisie in the ideological field and the party's leadership of this struggle.

From the above facts, it can be seen that Zhou Yang has completely distorted the party's "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy into bourgeois liberalization!

Just as in politics, Zhou Yang advocates liberalization but actually implements bourgeois dictatorship, in culture, Zhou Yang advocates liberalization but actually implements bourgeois dictatorship. His so-called "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is only to allow the bourgeoisie to bloom, not to allow the proletariat to bloom, only to allow revisionism to contend, not to allow Marxism to contend, only to allow the bourgeoisie and revisionists to have the freedom to be anti-party and anti-socialist, not to allow the proletariat and Marxists to have the freedom to counterattack. In recent years, some major anti-party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds, such as "Dismissal of Hai Rui," "Hai Rui's Memorial," "Li Huiming," "Xie Yaohuan," etc., Zhou Yang not only encouraged and supported them, but some were even created under his instigation and command. However, for the leftist criticism of these poisonous weeds and the criticism of revisionism, he used his authority to suppress them repeatedly and did not allow them to be published. Here, Zhou Yang's anti-party and anti-socialist bourgeois position is very clear!

7. Admiring Foreign and Ancient Cultures, Opposing the Proletarian Cultural Revolution

For many years, Zhou Yang has been advocating a theory of "eternal cultural tradition" to oppose Chairman Mao's revolutionary theory of creating proletarian new culture.

Let's first look at Zhou Yang's views on the opera issue. This Zhou Yang opposes the opera for policy propaganda and welcomes the acceptance of operas that propagate feudal ideology. He said: "Just after liberation, due to people's 'revolutionary enthusiasm,' they could not accept 'The Butterfly Lovers' and 'Drunken Beauty.' But after a year or two, they could accept it, reflecting the changes of the times. Therefore, about art, I think we should look at it from the process of historical development, we should consider the two aspects of satisfying the people's aesthetic needs and educating the people." Why does Zhou Yang ridicule people's 'revolutionary enthusiasm' and feel happy that people can accept operas like 'The Butterfly Lovers'? Because he feels that these things are "beautiful." He said: "I feel that there is a kind of eternal beauty and eternal charm in the opera, which makes people feel comfortable and happy. Someone asked: Can the opera conform to our specific times? Now our opera has already conformed to the specific times. This point, we should not shake. Our opera should go to communism, to eternity...." Therefore, he does not care about the content and advocates keeping all old operas. He said: "Some old artists' art is very good, originally it can be inherited, but because of emphasizing the content, that performance was discarded, so in our national art treasure, a part of things is lost, which is very regrettable. In short, we should use all means to keep many old operas." He even praised ghost operas. In his 1956 speech "On Several Problems in Current Literary and Artistic Creation," he said: "Like 'Catching the Ghost King,' the King is a type of Chen Shimei, he passed the imperial examination and became an official, and then abandoned his original lover. As a result, after she died, she turned into a ghost to catch the King.... Even as a ghost, she wants to take revenge, this reflects the people's resentment towards the old system, in the past it was thought that ghosts appearing in the opera were promoting superstition, but in fact, many operas with ghosts are good." It turns out that the root of the spread of ghost operas is also in Zhou Yang.

Zhou Yang's attitude towards opera is related to his use of all means to protect feudal culture. In his view, "the political philosophy, ethics, and the way of ruling between emperor and subject accumulated in the feudal society, although they are all feudal things, we can still learn something from them."

Zhou Yang not only uses all means to maintain feudal culture, but also worships Western bourgeois culture with all his heart. He said, "It's a pity that Marx didn't have time to reform literature, and later this task fell on the Russian Chernyshevsky." He himself claimed to be a "faithful follower of Chernyshevsky." He praised "Tolstoy and Goethe are the representatives of the peak of culture." He advocated "absorbing a large amount of foreign things for our use." For some foreign bourgeois figures, he thought they were untouchable. He said: "To do drama, there is a very important 'ski' (Stanislavsky), this is a very big 'ski.' Someone said 'down with ski,' this is very wrong. This should be learned, he has very important achievements, it is the only systematic one in the history of world drama, it cannot be overthrown, also cannot be overthrown, why to overthrow?" He required: "To preserve the ideology of the old times as a systematic thing in today's literature and art." Obviously, Zhou Yang is a loyal slave of the old culture of landlords and the bourgeoisie!

To promote his views, Zhou Yang fiercely attacked our criticism and struggle against feudalism and bourgeois ideology. He always wields two big sticks in his hands, one is the so-called opposition to "anti-historicism" or "formalism"; the other is the opposition to "rudeness." He loudly shouted, "do not kill the ancients with one stick," do not "massacre." To protect feudalism and bourgeois old culture, Zhou Yang also proposed a theory of "breaking is easy, establishing is difficult." He said: "Breaking is relatively easy, establishing is relatively difficult. Not every breaking is equal to establishing." He attacked our criticism of poisonous weeds as "relying on the majority to suppress people." Truly, a person of a class speaks the language of a class, the representative of the bourgeoisie hiding in the party now uses the words Zhou Yang used in the past to oppose the cultural revolution.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "Imperialist culture and semi-feudal culture are very close brothers, they form a reactionary alliance in culture to oppose China's new culture. This kind of reactionary culture serves imperialism and the feudal class, it is a thing that should be overthrown. Without overthrowing this thing, no new culture can be established. Not breaking, not stopping, not stopping, their struggle is a life-and-death struggle." Therefore, we must thoroughly criticize feudalism and capitalist culture. Only in this way can we truly absorb the excellent cultural achievements created by human history. For our ancient culture, we must remove its dross, absorb its essence, and inherit it critically according to the needs of socialism. For the progressive culture of foreign countries, we should also absorb it critically for reference. However, inheritance and reference cannot replace creation. While Zhou Yang admires foreign cultures and opposes the proletarian cultural revolution, isn't this clearly opposing Chairman Mao's instructions?

8. Promoting the Bourgeois "Expert" Line, Opposing the Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Occupying the Literary and Artistic Front

Chairman Mao pointed out more than twenty years ago in "On New Democracy" that the culture of New China "should serve the vast majority of workers, peasants, and laboring people, accounting for more than 90% of the nation, and gradually become their culture"; and said, "this cultural movement and practical movement are both mass movements." We must firmly implement Chairman Mao's principle of building and developing socialist culture. This means that in culture, we must firmly and thoroughly take the mass line, make the workers, peasants, and soldiers the main force in building socialist culture, and thoroughly break the bourgeois monopoly of culture. However, since the founding of the nation, Zhou Yang has been advocating and promoting a bourgeois "expert" line, completely ignoring the broad masses. In 1958, a cultural upsurge was launched among the broad masses, but in January 1959, Zhou Yang came out to pour cold water on this movement. In his speech at the propaganda work conference, he said: "What is a cultural upsurge, it should also be compared with foreign countries and ancient times, without great writers and great scientists, it is very difficult to call it a cultural upsurge." In Zhou Yang's mind, there are only those so-called famous writers, famous directors, and famous actors. Because of this view, he actually advocated starism in the film and drama circles. At the 1961 national feature film creation conference, he said: "We oppose starism, but we still need stars, in the eyes of the audience, the reputation of old actors is still greater, Bai Yang, Zhao Dan, Qin Yi... these are indeed our precious wealth.... Foreigners talk about fanaticism, some film fans must go to see the films of a certain actor." He also said at the 1962 July symposium on Changchun drama actors: "The spread of a drama genre in the masses must have its own artists. The representative figures of a drama genre, like Zhao Dan, Jin Shan, etc., this is like a political party must have a leader, it must have a representative." For schools, he also has this view. At the 1963 July symposium on teaching materials, he said: "The standard of a good school is to see if there are famous professors, just like the standard of a good troupe is to see if there are famous actors." In this way, he developed the theory of famous people and experts to the extreme, no longer emphasizing political leadership, no longer emphasizing the combination of red and expert. His theory is: "Art is good, then politics is first, if the art is not good, how to realize politics first? Like the army, political leadership, politics first, but if the troops are not good, how can politics be first?" In this way, he completely reversed the relationship between politics and technology and advocated the white expert road.

Because of his infatuation with "famous people" and "experts," Zhou Yang adopted the "three high" policy of high salary, high manuscript fee, and high treatment to vigorously cultivate some "spiritual nobles" who are high above the masses. These people are untouchable. If they are offended, he orders them to make "spiritual compensation" and "material compensation." Zhou Yang also openly shields rightists and exonerates rightists. He said: "In our country, some rightists may be leftists in the world bourgeois intellectuals, so we must criticize them and publish their articles, do not make them feel that they have collapsed, that they are finished." Zhou Yang is so actively promoting the "expert" line, shielding rightist elements, and preparing social pillars for capitalist restoration!

9. Distorting History, Advocating the So-Called Literary and Artistic Line of the 1930s

For many years, Zhou Yang has been advocating his bourgeois literary and artistic line of the 1930s, using various despicable means to attack Lu Xun, the great leader of China's new culture, and attack Chairman Mao's judgments on the new cultural movement.

As early as 1942, Zhou Yang proposed to take his literary and artistic line of the 1930s as the basis for proletarian literature and art. In "The Problem of Reforming Art Education," he said: "Since the May Fourth Movement, the new literature and art, especially the revolutionary literature and art of the left-wing decade, we must inherit, without it, we will lose our foothold." In 1958, in his lecture "Building Marxist Aesthetics" at Peking University, he said: "To explain and elucidate literary and artistic phenomena with Marxist views, to guide the development of the literary and artistic movement, to use Marxist literary views to oppose bourgeois literary views, has become a very important task on the ideological front of the proletariat. From the time we raised the banner of proletarian literature thirty years ago, we have been striving to do this. The task before us is to summarize the experience of the proletarian literary and artistic movement, including the experience of creation, theory, and movement, to establish Chinese Marxist aesthetics on the basis of summarizing experience, inheriting and sorting out the legacy." It can be seen that Zhou Yang and his group have always boasted of being the "orthodox" builders of the Marxist literary and artistic line, opposing Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line, and hard to say that their own bourgeois literary and artistic line of the 1930s is the proletarian literary and artistic line. Under the leadership of Zhou Yang, the commander-in-chief of the black line of the 1930s, his subordinates responded in unison. They held meetings and gave speeches, wrote books and biographies, made films, and self-praised. In March 1960, under Zhou Yang's instructions, the symposium on the 30th anniversary of the founding of the "Left League" organized by the editorial departments of "Literary Review" and "Literary Gazette" was a gathering to concentrate on advocating the bourgeois literary and artistic line of the 1930s; while works such as "A Collection of Historical Materials on the 50-Year History of Chinese Drama Movement" and "A History of the Development of Chinese Cinema" are all praises for the so-called "ancestors" and "old heads" of the 1930s.

Zhou Yang not only actively advocated their bourgeois literary and artistic line of the 1930s, but also distorted history and reversed right and wrong. In 1957, he used the criticism of the rightist Feng Xuefeng to later use the publication of "The Complete Works of Lu Xun" to reverse the verdict on the "National Defense Literature" slogan, slander Lu Xun, and defame the proletarian slogan of "National Revolutionary War Mass Literature." Under the advocacy of Zhou Yang and his group, many modern literature textbooks in many colleges and universities all said that the wrong slogan of "National Defense Literature" is correct, while the correct slogan of "National Revolutionary War Mass Literature" is wrong. Zhou Yang and his group's arrogant behavior is outrageous! Regarding this issue, the 9th issue of "Red Flag" magazine has published two articles by Ruan Ming and Ruan Ruoying, "A Dark Arrow of Zhou Yang's Reversal of History," and Mu Xin, "The 'National Defense Literature' is the Slogan of the Right-Opportunist Line of Wang Ming," which have systematically and deeply exposed and criticized it, so I will not elaborate.

10. Advocating the Theory of "Imaginary Thinking," Opposing Chairman Mao's "On Practice"

In order to make the literary and artistic field an independent kingdom not subject to Marxist epistemology, Zhou Yang has been advocating the so-called theory of imaginary thinking for many years. After the revisionists in the Soviet literary and artistic circles vigorously advocated the theory of imaginary thinking, Zhou Yang's advocacy of the theory of imaginary thinking became even more enthusiastic. In the 1959 symposium on the second session of the PLA literary and artistic performance, especially in the 1961 June literary and artistic work symposium, he emphasized this so-called imaginary thinking. He said: "If we talk about the special laws of literature and art, it is probably an issue of imaginary thinking. Not paying attention to imaginary thinking will lead to conceptualization." What is imaginary thinking? Zhou Yang said: "Imaginary thinking and logical thinking are two different things... doing theory relies on concepts, doing concepts makes it easy to do logical thinking; doing art makes it easy to do imaginary thinking." This means that literary and artistic writers recognize things and create according to special laws different from general cognitive laws. In this way, it provides theoretical weapons for those who oppose the party's leadership and Marxist theoretical guidance in the literary and artistic circles. Zhou Yang is precisely for this purpose that he specially advocated the theory of imaginary thinking in this period. After 1961, the ghosts and monsters in the literary and artistic circles launched an attack on the proletariat. The advocacy of the theory of imaginary thinking played a role in inciting this attack.

Zhou Yang brought in some so-called theories from foreign bourgeoisie and revisionism. He thought that literature and art is just a matter of "an image, an emotion," he said, "this emotion, it is truer than theory." This means that emotion is beyond reason. Writers have this "emotion" and can create well. He opposed writers having a theme first, he said: "Do not start writing with a theme, do not start thinking about what strategic thought to write." His advocacy is to oppose the rational cognition produced on the basis of practice in creation and oppose the guidance of Marxist theory.

The theory of imaginary thinking advocated by Zhou Yang is a theory of mysticism and obscurantism that excludes reason, it is a basis of epistemology for the modern revisionist literary and artistic trend, and it is a direct opposition to Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Practice." This so-called imaginary thinking does not exist in the world. However, he arrogantly declared: "Imaginary thinking, no one can overthrow." Because he is the "highest authority" in the literary and artistic field, this reactionary theory has spread in all university literary textbooks, spread among the broad literary and artistic circles, and been included in the newly published "Cihai," regarded as the truth. Regarding the detailed criticism of the theory of imaginary thinking, I have published the article "In the Literary and Artistic Field, We Must Insist on the Epistemology of Marxism" (see the 5th issue of "Red Flag"). This article is against the theory of imaginary thinking advocated by Zhou Yang. Due to the specific situation at that time, Zhou Yang's name was not directly mentioned. In this way, this article was sent to them in February 1963 and was detained by them for two years and eight months.

The above is a summary of the "ten major crimes" of Zhou Yang's anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought based on the materials we have come into contact with. His sectarianism in the organizational line is not included here. From this, it can be seen: Zhou Yang is a representative of the bourgeoisie who has infiltrated our party, the commander-in-chief of the black line in the literary and artistic circles, a die-hard revisionist, and a big bully in the cultural field.

Is this a coincidence? No! Zhou Yang has always been an opportunist. The editorial of "Liberation Army Daily" pointed out: In the 1930s, the political line of the left-wing literary movement was Wang Ming's "left" opportunist line in the early period and Wang Ming's right opportunist line in the later period; organizationally, it was sectarianism and exclusivism; the literary and artistic thought was actually the thought of Russian bourgeois literary critics Belinsky, Chernyshevsky, Dobrolyubov, and others. This is a summary of the history of Zhou Yang in the 1930s. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Zhou Yang stubbornly insisted on his bourgeois literary and artistic line, for which Comrade Mao Zedong had criticized him many times. Since the founding of the nation, he has expressed his support for Mao Zedong Thought on the surface, but in fact, he has opposed Mao Zedong Thought and continued to use bourgeois ideology and theory to guide our proletarian literary and artistic movement. The difference is that he has also accepted modern revisionist literary thought, which is more in line with the times.

The seriousness of the problem lies in the fact that Zhou Yang is the main leader of literary and artistic work. In the literary and artistic circles, he has cultivated his confidants, excluded dissidents, and created a situation of "prosperity for those who follow me, destruction for those who oppose me." Around him, he has gathered a group of "strategists" and "generals," and in various local literary and artistic organizations, he has placed some of their "warlords" and "governors." In this way, a thick, long, and deep black line system has been formed in the national literary and artistic circles. Zhou Yang, this commander-in-chief, can call out from a high place and respond from all directions, stir up waves, and do as he pleases. Today, they implement a revisionist line in literature and art, and once the time is ripe, they will carry out capitalist restoration in politics. The lesson is not far away, we must not ignore this danger.

At present, the proletarian cultural revolution in our country is a sharp and complex class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological field, a life-and-death struggle between the bourgeoisie's restoration and the proletariat's anti-restoration. In the literary and artistic field, smashing the black line of anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought led by Zhou Yang is an urgent task of this revolution that cannot be delayed. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and launch a fierce attack on Zhou Yang, this number one representative of the bourgeoisie in the literary and artistic circles. Strip off his disguise, thoroughly smash this black gang, clear away the poisonous mist they have spread, and truly put our literary and artistic work under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

    彻底清算周扬反党反社会主义的罪行
    郑季翘
    中华人民共和国成立以来，文艺界一直存在着一条反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的黑线。文艺界所以被搅得黑浪翻滚，十几年来基本上不执行党的政策，就是因为这条黑线不断兴妖作怪。而这条黑线所以能够不断兴妖作怪，又是因为在文艺工作的领导部门里资产阶级专了我们的政，有一个总根子。
    这个总根子是谁？就是负责领导文艺工作的前中共中央宣传部副部长周扬。他利用职权，把持着许多文艺部门，垄断了许多出版阵地，既可以调动组织力量，又可以制造文坛舆论。这样，他们的活动，就产生很大的影响，造成极大的危害。
    有人可能产生这样的疑问：周扬不是多年来一直是毛泽东文艺思想的“权威解释者”吗？不是曾经组织过对胡风反革命集团和丁玲、陈企霞等右派分子的斗争吗？这样的人怎么会成为黑线的总根子呢？其实，这统统是周扬及其同伙编造的神话，是一个大骗局。
    建国以来，文艺界的历次斗争，例如对《武训传》的批判，对《〈红楼梦〉研究》的批判，对胡适的批判，以及对胡风反革命集团的斗争，对丁玲、陈企霞和其他右派分子的斗争等，都是由党中央、毛主席直接领导的；而周扬则是站在反党反社会主义立场上，或明或暗，为资产阶级和修正主义立论设据，煽风点火，积极推行一条修正主义的文艺路线，全面地、系统地反对毛泽东思想。
    问题的复杂性在于：周扬是一个典型的阴险狡诈的伪君子和两面派。
    他惯于打着“红旗”反红旗。表面上拥护毛泽东思想，背地里诋毁毛泽东思想；大会上拥护毛泽东思想，小会上攻击毛泽东思想。
    他惯于使用折中主义的语言，是一个作“但书”文章的专家。他的文章、讲话，有一个突出特点，就是先来一段抽象的似乎正确的议论，紧接着便在“但是”后面大作反面文章。他论述问题的方法，正是一切修正主义者惯用的手法，模棱两可，亦此亦彼，把一些本质上对立的概念弄得混乱不堪，从而混淆了无产阶级与资产阶级、马克思主义与修正主义、社会主义与资本主义的界限，贩运了修正主义黑货。
    他惯于看风转舵，如同蜥蜴一样，随时改变其颜色。右派猖獗的时候，他就给他们煽风打气，一同向党进攻；而当反击右派开始时，他就伪装左派，作报告，写文章，装潢自己，贪天之功；当斗争深入发展，快要触及到他的时候，他就采取牺牲车马、保存主帅的办法来解脱自己。
    所以，对于周扬的认识，万不可被他的表面现象所迷惑。
    现在，这个混在党内几十年的文艺界黑线的头子，已经被揪出来了。下面我们就来看看周扬在近些年来所干的罪恶勾当。
    一、恶毒攻击毛泽东思想，反对党对文艺的领导
    毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃、社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代，天才地、创造性地、全面地继承和发展了的马克思列宁主义；是我国革命各个阶段上唯一正确的指针，是被压迫人民和被压迫民族反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义和一切反动派的强大的革命思想武器。毛泽东同志是当代国际共产主义运动最伟大的旗手，是中国人民和世界革命人民最爱戴的领袖。拥护还是反对毛泽东思想，拥护还是反对毛泽东同志，是区别马克思主义和修正主义、革命和反革命的分水岭。而作为中共中央宣传部副部长的周扬，不仅不宣传毛泽东思想，不号召文艺工作者努力活学活用毛泽东思想，不提倡文艺作品努力表现毛泽东思想，反而公然反对文艺宣传毛泽东思想，恶毒地攻击毛泽东思想。
    毛泽东同志在一九四○年发表了《新民主主义论》，在一九四二年发表了《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，在一九五七年发表了《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》和《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》。这些著作，光辉地发展了马克思主义的文艺理论，提出了最完整、最彻底、最正确的文艺路线，解决了美学的根本问题。而周扬却狂妄地企图建立自己的一个美学体系。他在一九五八年在北京大学作了《建设马克思主义的美学》的报告，并计划要和他的同伙林默涵和邵荃麟等人，陆续进行讲演，鼓吹他们的资产阶级的反动思想，来和毛主席的伟大学说相对抗。
    周扬是一贯反对党对文艺的领导的。他攻击党对文艺工作的领导是“干涉”，是“包办”。他要我们同党外人士共同领导文艺，他在一九六一年中宣部召集的长春电影制片厂党员艺术干部座谈会上说：“你同党外人士合作，不是共同领导？……千万不要发展到蛮干，你通过党内外的专家去领导，就是领导嘛。党的领导是总的领导，具体的部门是要共同领导吧！”他觉得党员艺术干部多了倒是个祸害，因此提出：“你们（指长春电影制片厂）的艺术干部中非党人士太少，也是个缺点，是不是从上海调几个去到你们那里担任副职，调剂调剂，我真是这样想。”一九六二年，他在长春话剧演员座谈会上挑拨说：“对我们每个同志来说，应该锻炼这么一种能力，就是能在好的领导下做好工作，也能在不好的领导下做好工作。……在特别不好的领导下做好工作，要锻炼这种本领。”这里，他所说的“不好的”领导，就是指着党委的领导说的。不久以后，他和辽宁文艺界谈话时又说：“艺术创作也同医生开刀一样，领导的责任是挑好医生，开死开活都交给他，由他负责。”他反对文艺创作上领导、作家和群众的结合，恶意地把这种“三结合”歪曲为“领导出思想，群众出生活，作家出笔”。他自己这样丑化了“三结合”之后，又对“三结合”加以嘲讽，他说：“作家那么容易做呀，还要作家干什么？那训练一大批秘书，都会写，你讲出来，我就会写，写了以后群众来补充生活，那还要作家干什么。作家还有什么可贵！”由以上的事实可以看出：周扬煽动文艺工作者脱离和反对党的领导，是费尽心机的。
    不仅如此。他还借古讽今，指桑骂槐，发泄内心对各级党委的仇视情绪。他在一九六一年全国故事片创作会议上说：“几百年以后的人看我们党员要那么服从组织纪律，正象我们看岳飞那么服从皇帝一样，为什么几块金牌就把他调回去了，他们会不了解我们为什么开会斗争那么辛苦，为什么那么胆小，怕什么‘边缘地带’。”他又煽动说：“同志们用‘边缘’二字，有深意存焉！一不小心掉入右派深渊、反党深渊、右倾机会主义深渊、修正主义深渊。深渊太多，一下跌入，万劫不复。”显然，这是污蔑我们的党，污蔑党和国家领导人，污蔑无产阶级专政。
    大家知道，以毛主席为首的党中央是执行民主集中制的典范。一切方针、政策的制定，都是从群众中来，又到群众中去的。在我们国家，出现了一种史无前例的既有集中又有民主，既有纪律又有自由，既有统一意志，又有个人心情舒畅的生动活泼的政治局面。占人口绝大多数的工农兵、革命干部和革命的知识分子作了国家的主人，个个扬眉吐气，胸怀坦荡。试问：在无产阶级专政的条件下，是什么人怕掉入右派深渊、反党深渊、右倾机会主义深渊和修正主义深渊？只能是地富反坏右，只能是那些存心反党反社会主义而又不得不装出一副拥护党、拥护社会主义的两面派。至于文艺事业，它是无产阶级革命事业的一个组成部分，必须接受党的绝对领导。周扬用尽心机反对党对文艺事业的领导，他到底是一个什么样的人，不是暴露的十分清楚吗？
    二、贩卖资产阶级人性论，反对马克思主义阶级论
    阶级观点，是马克思主义的一个根本观点。承认阶级存在，并自觉地为无产阶级的革命事业奋斗，是马克思主义者最起码的条件。同样，承认文学艺术的党性原则，即承认文学艺术为一定的阶级服务，并自觉地使文学艺术为无产阶级的政治服务，为工农兵服务，这是马克思主义的文学艺术家的一个起码条件。毛泽东同志《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中说：
  “为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。”又说：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。为艺术的艺术，超阶级的艺术，和政治并行或互相独立的艺术，实际上是不存在的。”这个问题本来是讲得再清楚不过了。而周扬却说“人类的美的事物是客观存在的”。这样他就否定了“美”的阶级性。不仅如此，周扬还胡说我们现在的文学，是“全民文艺”。赫鲁晓夫抛出的是“全民党”、“全民国家”，周扬抛出的是“全民文艺”，显然，周扬和赫鲁晓夫唱的是一个调头。
    周扬极端仇恨阶级观点，竭力抹煞文学艺术的阶级性。他在一九六一年全国故事片创作会议上说：“在人性论的争论上，我们需要开展两条战线的斗争，一方面是反对资产阶级的人性论，另一方面是反对我们的阶级标签主义。……标签主义是把什么都贴上一张阶级标签，说这是资产阶级的，那是无产阶级的，好象人就是阶级的化身，只有阶级性。”他这里所说的“反对资产阶级人性论”是虚晃的一枪，他实际攻击的就是文学艺术的阶级性。这看看他在这个发言里的另一段话就可明白：“共鸣与阶级性的关系不大，任何一个阶级的艺术绝不只是给本阶级看的，它是给所有的阶级看的，引起所有人的共鸣，至于它引不引得起来，那是另一回事。所以艺术作品是任何一个阶级都可以接受的，一个阶级产生的作品不能只供本阶级欣赏，否则这个作品是失败的。”接着又说：“有的作品，则是既反映阶级利益，又反映全体人民的利益。”在这里，他要无产阶级对资产阶级的文艺作品发生共鸣，要无产阶级欣赏资产阶级的文艺，这不就是说无产阶级和资产阶级具有共同的人性吗？他没有丝毫批判人性论，相反，正是狂热地宣扬了人性论，反对了阶级论。
    周扬对“人道主义”的吹捧也是很卖劲的。就在上述在北京大学的那次讲演中，他说“我们的人道主义是最彻底的”。他经常把“人民性”挂在嘴上。这种所谓人民性，就是人道主义的别名。他在一九五六年全国剧目工作会议上的报告中说：“戏曲里的人民性是很丰富的，不要用狭隘的观点去看它，而认为统治者就没有人民性。统治者也有有人民性的。如况钟、包拯等人，他们是统治阶级，而且包拯的官很大，但他对人民好，人民对他寄托了很多理想，因此从这里面可以看到很多表现人民愿望的东西。中国戏曲的好处，是它比其他文学作品更有人民性。”周扬把无产阶级的文艺，说成是最彻底的人道主义的文艺，把封建统治者说成具有人民性，这就是公然地抹煞阶级矛盾，宣扬阶级调和论。
    周扬散播的这种剥削阶级与被剥削阶级之间的“共同”的政治伦理，“共同”的人性，“共同”的情感，否定马克思主义阶级观点的资产阶级的谰言，还散见于他的好多报告与讲话中。他宣称“人总是倾向正义，倾向公道”，凡是大作家都“要使他的作品为人类服务”，等等。毛主席早在二十多年前就对人性论作了最彻底的批判，指出在阶级社会里只有阶级的人性，没有超阶级的人性。而周扬却在大谈敌对阶级之间的“共性”，大谈“为人类服务”，这不明明是对抗毛泽东思想吗！
    三、为现代修正主义辩护，攻击马克思列宁主义
    现代修正主义，是当前共产主义运动中的主要危险。这一点，毛主席早在一九五七年发表的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》中就说得一清二楚，并在党中央接连发表的反修文章中继续得到阐明。而周扬，竟然在一九六○年中国科学院哲学社会科学研究工作座谈会上说：“修正主义学术思想在中国还不是主要的，……因为：一、我们反对了胡风，批判了右派，修正主义不容易抬头；二、中国的修正主义比外国差得多……；三、修正主义刚在露头，未得机会大发展，因为它刚露头就容易把它消灭，所以要想在现在批判修正主义还要临时培植修正主义咧！真正的修正主义还要有一套理论嘛！”这里周扬特别吹捧修正主义有一套所谓“理论”，并认为我们在国内反对修正主义，还必须“临时培植修正主义”，这真是极其荒谬的奇谈怪论！周扬还竭尽心思地为苏联修正主义辩护。他在一九六三年文艺工作会议上的报告中说：“修正主义拚命讲人情，我们就同他唱对台戏，偏不讲人情，你讲平等，我偏不讲平等，你讲和平，我偏不讲和平，你讲劳动，我偏不讲劳动，对立起来。我们不要干这种傻事。”在这里，周扬故意制造混乱，混淆是非。修正主义什么时候真正地强调过“劳动”？我们在什么时候有过“偏不讲劳动”的事情？周扬维护修正主义，竟然恶毒到这样一种地步！
    更为严重的是，在我们已经连续发表了八篇批判苏共中央公开信以后的一九六四年五月，周扬在近代史学术讨论会上还在叫嚷，对于反修问题“需要好好研究一下，不要太急，因为它究竟不是现实问题”。这完全是一派胡言。修正主义就是用马克思列宁主义词句装饰起来的资本主义思想，就是右倾机会主义思想。毛泽东同志指出，社会主义社会存在着阶级、阶级斗争。社会主义社会的主要矛盾，就是两个阶级、两条道路的斗争。用修正主义思想来腐蚀干部和群众，实行和平演变，正是资产阶级向无产阶级进行斗争的主要方式之一。周扬说反修不是现实问题，就是宣传阶级斗争熄灭论，就是要我们对“和平演变”的主要危险失去警惕，就是叫我们听任现代修正主义思想泛滥，以便于资本主义复辟。
    周扬对修正主义是这样意厚情深，但对所谓“教条主义”却是切齿痛恨的。在党的第八次全国代表大会上，他就高嚷着反教条主义。他说：“我们今天的文学艺术上的教条主义，主要表现在把马克思主义的美学观点庸俗化和简单化，给文艺创作制定了许多僵硬的‘清规戒律’，束缚了作家、艺术家的手足。教条主义和宗派主义结合起来，给文艺的发展造成了损害。”而在一九六二年关于《文学概论大纲》的一次讨论会上，他假惺惺地说了一句“观点中要贯彻反修正主义”之后，接着就讲：“另一方面，虽然不一定公开提反教条主义，但实际要反，反它的取消艺术特点。”这里，周扬所反的“教条主义”，正是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。
    周扬就是这样倒行逆施的！
    四、宣扬资产阶级的文艺路线，反对文艺为工农兵服务
    周扬在他公开发表的文章以及某些讲话中，有时也提到文艺为工农兵服务、为社会主义服务的问题。但这是一种装点，一种掩护。实际上，周扬正是以最集中的火力、最系统的理论，反对毛主席提出的文艺为工农兵服务、为社会主义服务的方向的。
    他以反“题材决定”论反对作家描写工农兵，反对表现社会主义。周扬说，重大的题材“不一定”是
  “政治上的重大事件”，而是“能够引起大家注意和兴趣的题材，又是对大家有益的题材”；又说，“不要领导提倡什么就写什么”；又说，“现代题材还是从‘五四’算起”。这些主张都是一个意思，那就是说：作家可以写工农兵，也可以写资产阶级、地主富农、帝王将相；可以写重大的政治斗争，也可以写身边琐事、风花雪月、儿女私情；可以写社会主义革命，也可以写荒古趣闻、旧国遗事、外域风光。大家知道，题材问题关系到谁是我们社会主义文艺的主人公的问题，关系到什么是我们社会主义文艺的主题的问题。以工农兵英雄人物为主人公的作品和以地主资产阶级为主人公的作品，绝不可同日而语；以风雷激荡的社会主义大革命为主题的作品和以个人身边琐事为主题的作品，绝不能等量齐观。把这些相提并论，实际上就是给封建主义和资本主义的东西开路，反对表现工农兵，反对歌颂社会主义，反对文艺为无产阶级政治服务。
    周扬提出了一个“间接配合”论。他在一九五九年在北京大学的讲课《文艺与政治》中说：“我们讲文艺服从政治的时候，要防止、克服、纠正另外一种简单化的方法，就是把文艺为政治服务简单地理解为为每一个具体的政治运动、每一个具体的政策作宣传。”他在一九六一年文艺工作座谈会上说：“直接配合与间接配合，都是为政治服务。”应该指出，政治并不是抽象的东西。无产阶级的政治，一定要体现为具体的无产阶级的政策，具体的无产阶级的政治运动。文艺不给具体政策和具体政治运动作宣传，文艺为无产阶级政治服务就成了一句空话。周扬提倡“间接配合”论，就是要引导文艺脱离无产阶级政治。
    为什么文艺不能给具体政策和政治运动作宣传呢？周扬假借了时代不同的说法。他在一九五六年全国剧目工作会议上说：“我们现在要解决的人民文化的需要，与革命战争时期有所不同。在革命战争的特殊情况下，要用戏剧去宣传鼓动，为了配合任务，就有《动员参军》、《送公粮》、《瓦解敌军》等节目，作为政治鼓动。现在我们处于和平建设的时代，我们在建设社会主义，人民需要社会主义的精神食粮，情况就不同了。过去宣传鼓动的戏，在野外演，大家来看，看完了就上前线；现在则是在大剧场演戏，观众都要花钱买票，并且要排队买票，戏如果不好，他们就不来，所以我们必须有些本领才行。因此，我们现在要提出，剧目要好，要多样，要符合群众的需要。”他这里把《动员参军》之类的反映当时政治要求的戏和所谓“好戏”对立起来，又把戏的好坏归结到票房价值！与此相应，他又提出“四好电影”的主张，那就是“要有好故事、好演员、好镜头、好音乐”，就是不要好政治、好思想。大家看，在周扬的心目中，在社会主义时代，文艺倒不需要为工农兵服务、为无产阶级政治服务了！这样，我们现在所提倡的文艺工作者上山下乡和“乌兰牧骑”式的文艺活动，倒是不合乎时代要求了。这不是荒谬透顶吗！
    周扬以研究中外古典作家与政治的关系为名，宣传“为艺术而艺术不一定都是反动”的理论。这也是为了引导文艺脱离无产阶级政治，为资产阶级政治服务。为此，周扬还提倡大搞滑稽影片。他在一九六一年文艺工作座谈会上说：“现在生活已经很紧张了，不要看戏的时候也搞得那么紧张……要搞些轻松愉快的东西，可以大搞喜剧影片，大搞滑稽影片。”一九六一年以后，出现了象《球迷》、《大李小李和老李》等庸俗不堪的坏影片，就是周扬这个理论的恶果。
    和上述理论相适应，周扬又创造了一个“无害”文艺论。周扬把文艺分为有益、无害、有害三种。“所谓无害，就是政治上没有害处，而在生活上还有点益处的。比如戏曲《游园惊梦》、山水画就属于这一类”。世界上真有这种政治上不属于任何阶级的第三种文艺吗？就从他所举的例子来看，《游园惊梦》难道不是宣传封建迷信、才子佳人的鬼戏吗？难道是“无害”的吗？周扬到底是三十年代文艺的一个头目，他竟然把那时某些人们宣传的所谓第三种文艺的黑货给贩来了！
    五、煽动文艺工作者拒绝思想改造，坚持资产阶级反动立场
    文艺工作者怎样才能真正做到为工农兵服务、为社会主义服务？最根本的道路，就是学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，长期地、无条件地、全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，把自己的世界观来一个彻底的改造，使自己的思想感情真正无产阶级化，并从工农兵群众的斗争生活中获得丰富的创作源泉。这条道路，毛主席早已指示得明明白白。但是，对于这样一条革命化的道路，周扬是反对的，仇视的。在他的报告和讲话中，不强调文艺工作者学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，不认真提倡文艺工作者与工农兵相结合，改造世界观；偶而提及，也只是把深入生活当作搜集创作素材的手段。相反，周扬实际上是反对作家在实践中改造自己的世界观的。他要人们不要“经常把世界观挂在嘴上”，他认为“什么都是政治，什么都是世界观”，就是“把世界观庸俗化”。他主张“不表现时代、不反革命也允许。”他号召：“现代题材历史题材都可以写。作家可以按照自己的经验，写自己熟悉的、有兴趣的、有把握的题材。”他的这种主张，是反革命分子胡风的“到处有生活”的翻版。
    一九六二年，是我国由于三年自然灾害和修正主义背信弃义而遭到暂时困难的一年。正是在这一年，周扬一伙在大连召开了一个座谈会，放出了大量的攻击总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的毒箭。在这个会上，周扬煽动作家和党的方针政策对立，鼓吹了所谓“写真实”论。他说：“看法和党有距离，可以暂时不写。要忠实于生活、忠实于真理、忠实于客观事物。”这是一段恶毒的反党黑话！革命的作家有时候会产生跟不上党的方针政策的情况，但这和周扬所宣扬的绝不是一回事。周扬把党的方针政策和“生活”、“真理”、“客观事物”对立起来，这就是说，他们那一伙作家的看法，是符合生活实际，符合于真理的；而党的方针政策倒是错误的，不符合生活实际的。周扬所以这样主张，实际上是煽动作家写反党反社会主义的毒草，为资产阶级复辟开辟道路。在这个会议上，还抛出了“写中间人物”论及其他一些反党反社会主义的言论。周扬得意洋洋地要他们写暴露我国所谓“阴暗面”的作品，他说这种小说“把矛盾都展开了，我看能很有味道！”周扬及其黑帮所鼓吹的“写真实”论，“写中间人物”论，到底是什么货色，这不是很明白的吗？
    关于指导作家创作的问题，毛泽东同志提出革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合的方针（一般叫作创作方法，实际上这应该说是作家创作的指导方针），这就是说，无产阶级作家的作品应该是以现实生活为基础，而又是在社会主义、共产主义的理想指导下写出来的。这样的作品，既反映了现实生活，又贯注着鼓舞人们建设和保卫社会主义，并为共产主义积极奋斗的理想，从而使广大读者受到教育，使文艺真正成为推进无产阶级事业的有力的武器。这个原则是马克思主义文艺思想的一个新创造。每一个革命的作家都应毫不犹豫地贯彻这个写作方针。但是作为党的文艺工作的领导者的周扬是怎样对待这个方针的呢？他在一九六一年全国故事片创作会议上说：“浪漫主义、现实主义怎样体现？作家协会、戏剧家协会的章程里都没有规定，随便你们好了，高兴体现就体现，不高兴体现就不体现。”这里，周扬及其一伙，竟然狂妄到这种地步，把他所操纵的作家协会、戏剧家协会等组织，置于党之上，置于毛泽东同志之上，公然拒绝执行毛泽东同志的指示。
    周扬为了给反党反社会主义的毒草提供阵地，还主张开辟“文艺的自由市场”。他说：“我看可出内部刊物，还要‘五不’，随便写，可能还出好作品呢。……这内部刊物一是作品，二是争论问题，包括对党的政策的不同意的，报上不能公开发表的，文艺的自由市场。”十分明显，这种所谓“文艺的自由市场”，就是反党反社会主义的地下刊物，是黑市。在这个刊物上发表的作品，必然是向党向社会主义射出的冷枪暗箭。这种刊物就是中国的裴多菲俱乐部的反革命工具。周扬所以想要办这样一个刊物，就是企图把那些拒绝思想改造的反党反社会主义的作家，聚集在他的黑旗之下，以便积蓄力量，磨拭武器，进行有组织的反革命复辟活动。
    六、歪曲党的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的阶级政策，鼓吹资产阶级自由化
    党所提出的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，是一个发展无产阶级文学艺术和学术思想的方针；实行这个方针的目的，是为了建立和繁荣社会主义文化。十多年来，周扬几乎逢会必谈“双百”，但几乎也无一例外，每次都把这个方针说成是没有条件的。他在一九五六年召开的文艺工作会议上说：“应该是先百花齐放，所有民族传统的东西都发展了，然后在这个基础上，产生新的东西。”这就是说，不管作品的政治内容是封建主义的还是资本主义的，都可以自由地放。他指责说：“现在虽然没有人公开主张‘一花独放，一家独鸣’；可是他实质上采取了一花独放，一家独鸣。从表面上看起来，他这个快。排斥所有的，只要是非社会主义的，他都排斥，他使社会主义文化很快地占领了阵地。表面上看起来很快，可是实际上效果却很慢。因为他排斥那些旧的东西，他的社会主义文化就得不到营养；没有人跟他竞赛，他就不能从旧专家、老前辈那里吸收东西，就把自己弄得枯了”（着重点为引者所加）。周扬认为，社会主义文化的源泉，不是广大革命群众所从事的社会主义革命和建设的实践，而是旧文化、旧专家、旧艺人，他公然主张在文化领域里实行赫鲁晓夫的“和平竞赛”。
    周扬埋怨别人不推行他的所谓“双百”。他在一九六一年教育问题的座谈会上说：“有的同志在报刊上发表修正主义的文章要检讨，犯了‘双百’就不检讨……也没有人让他去检讨。”这样，他既责备了没有人让检讨违犯“双百”的事，也用对比的方式，为写了修正主义文章而检讨了的人呼冤叫屈。“同声相应，同气相求”，周扬心灵深处包藏着什么，很自然地就流露出来了。
    周扬这样热中于他的这种所谓“双百”，其真正的目的到底是什么呢？他在一九六三年四月的文艺工作会议上有一段表白：“意识形态的市场里，要估计到不但有现代艺术家的创作，还有古人留下的东西。精神食粮，包括一是我们的新的，一是古代的，一是外来的，十八、九世纪的东西，这些都在文化市场中流通。”原来，除了搞“黑市”以外，周扬还要在文化领域公开开放自由市场，要把社会主义的文化阵地变成我们和“外国”、“死人”共存的“三三制”。
    毛主席在提出“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针时，制订了六条政治标准，作为衡量香花、毒草的根据。党的领导，就是要扶植香花，铲掉毒草，扶植新生事物，反对腐朽事物。而周扬却从不强调党的领导，不强调六条标准，大肆宣扬“在我们文艺园地里，开放的都是花”；并且提出一个奇怪的主张，说“艺术创作和学术讨论的自由要保证，保证这些就是保证党的领导”。这就是说，让各种封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的东西自由泛滥，就是“保证党的领导”。这样，他就根本否定了在意识形态领域中兴无灭资的斗争和党对这一斗争的领导。
    从以上的事实可以看出，周扬把党的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针完全歪曲为资产阶级自由化！
    和在政治上标榜自由化而实际上是资产阶级专政一样，在文化上，周扬鼓吹自由化，实际上所实行的却是资产阶级专政。他所说的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”，就是只准资产阶级放，不准无产阶级放，只准修正主义鸣，不准马克思主义鸣，只准许资产阶级、修正主义者有反党反社会主义的自由，不准许无产阶级、马克思主义者有反击的自由。这些年来，一些反党反社会主义的大毒草，如《海瑞罢官》、《海瑞上疏》、《李慧娘》、《谢瑶环》等等，周扬不仅给以鼓励和支持，有的并且是在他自己的策动和指挥下制造出来的。而对无产阶级左派批判这些毒草和批判修正主义的文章，却利用职权，一再扣压，不予发表。在这里，周扬的反党反社会主义的资产阶级立场，是十分清楚的！
    七、崇洋颂古，反对无产阶级文化大革命
    周扬多年来一直在宣扬一种“文化传统永恒”论，对抗毛主席提出的关于创造无产阶级新文化的革命学说。
    我们先看一看周扬对于戏曲问题的主张吧。这个周扬，反对戏剧为政策宣传，欢呼人们接受宣传封建意识的戏剧。他说：“刚解放，由于人们有一种‘革命情绪’，连《梁山伯与祝英台》、《贵妃醉酒》都接受不了。但过了一两年，就能接受了，这里面反映着时代的变化。所以关于艺术，我觉得应当从历史的发展过程上看，应当考虑到满足人民美感的需要与教育人民的两个方面。”周扬为什么对于人们的那种“革命情绪”加以讥讽，而对于人们能接受《梁山伯与祝英台》之类的戏曲而感觉欣慰呢？因为他感到这些东西
  “美”。他说：“我感觉戏曲里面有一种永久的美丽，一种永远的魅力，使人看了舒服愉快。有人问：戏曲是否能合乎我们的具体时代？现在我们的戏曲，就已合乎具体时代了。这一点，我们不要动摇。我们的戏曲，要一直到共产主义，到永久……。”正因为这样，周扬就不管什么内容，主张把旧戏曲都保留下来。他说：“有些老艺人的艺术满好，本来可以继承，因为要强调内容，就把那个节目丢了，因此在我们民族艺术的宝藏里边就损失掉一部分东西，这是很可惜的。总之，我们要想一切办法，使许多旧戏保留下来。”他甚至吹捧鬼戏，他在一九五六年《关于当前文艺创作上的几个问题》的讲演中说：“如《活捉王魁》，王魁是一个陈世美型的人物，他考中状元做了官，就抛弃了原来的爱人。结果她死了以后变成鬼去活捉王魁。……变成鬼也要报仇，这表现了人民对旧制度的愤懑，过去认为戏里出鬼是宣扬迷信，其实出鬼的戏有很多是好的。”原来，鬼戏泛滥的根子，也在周扬这里。
    周扬对于戏曲的这种态度，是和他用尽一切办法来保护封建文化的主张相联系的。在他看来，“在封建社会里积累的政治哲学、伦理哲学、君臣父子之道等，尽管都是封建的东西，但我们还是可以从这里面学到一些东西的”。
    周扬不仅用尽一切办法维护封建文化，而且对西方资产阶级文化的崇拜，也是五体投地的。他胡说“可惜马克思没来得及改造文学，后来这个任务就落在俄国车尔尼雪夫斯基身上”。他自己声称是“车尔尼雪夫斯基的忠实信奉者”。他吹捧“托尔斯泰和歌德这两个人是代表文化的高峰”。他主张“大量地吸收外国的东西为我们所用”。对于外国资产阶级的某些人物，他认为是碰不得的。他说：“搞戏剧得有个很重要的‘斯基’（史坦尼斯拉夫斯基），这是一个很大的‘斯基’。有人说‘打倒斯基’，这是很不对的了。这要学，人家有很重要的成就，是在世界戏剧史上唯一有体系的，根本不能打倒，也打不倒，为什么要打倒？”他要求：“把旧时代的意识形态作为系统的东西保留在今天的文艺中。”很显然，周扬是地主、资产阶级旧文化的忠实奴才！
    为了推行他的这种主张，周扬疯狂地攻击我们对封建主义、资产阶级意识形态所展开的批判和斗争。他手中经常挥舞着两根大棒，一根是所谓反对“反历史主义”或“公式主义”；另一根是反对“粗暴”。他大声疾呼，“不能一棍子打死古人”，不要“大杀大砍”。为了保护封建主义和资产阶级的旧文化，周扬还提出一个“破易立难”论。他说：“破比较容易，立就比较困难了。不是每一个破同时都等于立。”他攻击我们批判毒草，是“靠人多势众”来压人。真是一个阶级的人说着一个阶级的话，钻在党内的资产阶级代表人物现在反对文化大革命所用的话，周扬在过去就讲过了。
    毛主席指出：“帝国主义文化和半封建文化是非常亲热的两兄弟，它们结成文化上的反动同盟，反对中国的新文化。这类反动文化是替帝国主义和封建阶级服务的，是应该被打倒的东西。不把这种东西打倒，什么新文化都是建立不起来的。不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行，它们之间的斗争是生死斗争。”因此，我们对于封建主义和资本主义的文化，必须加以彻底的批判。只有这样，才能真正吸取人类历史上所创造的优秀文化成果。对于我国古代的文化，我们必须剔除其糟粕，吸取其精华，根据社会主义的需要，批判地继承。对于外国进步的文化，我们也要批判地吸取，以为借鉴。然而继承和借鉴，决不能代替创造。而周扬却崇洋颂古，反对无产阶级文化大革命，这不明明是和毛主席的指示唱对台戏吗！
    八、推行资产阶级“专家”路线，反对工农兵占领文艺阵地
    毛主席早在二十多年前的《新民主主义论》中就明确指出，新中国的文化，“它应为全民族中百分之九十以上的工农劳苦民众服务，并逐渐成为他们的文化”；又说，“这种文化运动和实践运动，都是群众的”。我们建设和发展社会主义的文化，必须坚决执行毛主席的这项原则指示。这就是说，在文化上我们要坚决彻底地走群众路线，使工农兵成为建设社会主义文化的主力军，彻底打破资产阶级对文化的垄断。可是建国以来，周扬却一直在宣扬和推行一条资产阶级的“专家”路线，完全不把广大群众放在眼里。一九五八年，在广大群众中掀起了一个文化高潮，而在一九五九年一月，周扬就出来给这个运动泼冷水。他在宣传工作会议上的讲话中说：“什么叫作文化高潮，也得和外国、和古代比较比较，没有大作家、大科学家就很难叫文化高潮。”在周扬的心目中，只有那些所谓名作家、名导演、名演员。正因他有这种观点，他就在影剧界实际上提倡了明星主义。他在一九六一年六月全国故事片创作会议上说：“我们反对明星主义，但还是要有明星，在观众中，还是老演员的名声比较大，白杨、赵丹、秦怡……，这当然是我们宝贵的财富……。外国人讲狂热，有些电影狂对某个演员演的片子非去看不可。”他又在一九六二年七月长春话剧演员座谈会上说：“剧种在群众中的流传，必须有自己的艺术家。剧种的代表人物，象赵丹、金山等人，这有如一个政党要有一个领袖一样，要有一个代表。”对于学校，他也是这样的看法。他在一九六三年七月教材工作会议上说：“学校好不好的标准，要看有没有名教授，就象剧团好不好要看有无名演员一样。”这样，他就把名人专家路线和单纯技术观点发展到极度，不要政治挂帅了，也不要红专结合了。他的理论是：“艺术好才能政治第一，艺术不好，怎么实现政治第一？象军队一样，政治挂帅、政治第一，但队伍不好，不能打仗，怎么政治第一呀”。这样，他就把政治和技术的关系完全颠倒过来，宣扬了白专道路。
    由于醉心于“名人”和“专家”，周扬就采用高工薪、高稿酬、高待遇这种“三高政策”，极力造就一些高踞于群众之上的“精神贵族”。这些人是碰不得的。如果触犯了他们，他就勒令对之进行“精神退赔”和“物质退赔”。周扬还公开地包庇右派，为右派开脱，替右派翻案。他说：“在我们国家的一些右派，在世界资产阶级知识分子中可能是左派，所以我们既要批判他们，又要发表他们的文章，不要使他们感到垮台了，完了。”周扬就是这样积极推行“专家”路线，为右派分子打掩护，给资本主义复辟准备社会支柱的！
    九、篡改历史，鼓吹所谓三十年代文艺路线
    多年以来，周扬一直在宣扬他的三十年代的资产阶级文艺路线，采取各种卑鄙手段，攻击中国新文化的伟大旗手鲁迅，攻击毛主席关于新文化的运动的论断。
    早在一九四二年，周扬就提出要把他的三十年代的文艺路线作为无产阶级文艺的基础。他在《艺术教育的改造问题》中说：“五四以来的新文艺，特别是左翼十年中的革命文艺的历史传统，我们必须继承，离开它，我们便失去了立足点。”一九五八年他在北京大学所作的《建设马克思主义的美学》的讲演中说：“用马克思主义的观点来解释和说明文艺现象，指导文艺运动的发展，用马克思主义的文艺观来反对资产阶级的文艺观，就成了无产阶级思想战线上的一项十分重要的任务。从我们打出无产阶级文学旗帜的三十年来，我们都是努力这样做的。摆在我们面前的任务，就是要总结无产阶级文艺运动的经验，包括创作、理论和运动的经验，在总结经验、整理和继承遗产的基础上，建立中国的马克思主义美学。”可以看出，周扬等人一直自诩为“正统”的马克思主义文艺路线的建立者，反对毛主席的文艺路线，硬把三十年代他们自己的资产阶级文艺路线说成是无产阶级文艺路线。在周扬这个三十年代黑线主帅的带头鼓吹下，其麾下战将，群起响应。开会讲演，出书立传，摄制电影，进行自我吹嘘。一九六○年三月，在周扬的指示下，由《文学评论》和《文艺报》编辑部召开的纪念“左联”成立三十周年座谈会，就是一次集中地宣扬三十年代资产阶级文艺路线的集会；而《中国话剧运动五十年史料集》、《中国电影发展史》等著作，则都是吹捧三十年代的所谓“祖师爷”和“老头子”的。
    周扬不仅积极鼓吹他们三十年代的资产阶级文艺路线，而且篡改历史，颠倒黑白。在一九五七年，他利用对右派分子冯雪峰的批判，以后又利用《鲁迅全集》的出版，为“国防文学”口号翻案，污蔑鲁迅，诋毁“民族革命战争的大众文学”这个无产阶级口号。在周扬及其一伙的鼓吹下，许多大专院校的现代文学教材，都把“国防文学”这个错误的口号说成是正确的，而把“民族革命战争的大众文学”这个正确的口号说成是错误的。周扬等人的这种狂妄行为，是令人发指的！关于这个问题，《红旗》杂志第九期已经发表了阮铭、阮若瑛同志的《周扬颠倒历史的一支暗箭》和穆欣同志的《“国防文学”是王明右倾机会主义路线的口号》两篇文章，进行了系统的深刻的揭露和批判，我就不详细叙述了。十、宣扬“形象思维”论，
    反对毛主席的《实践论》
    为了把文艺领域划为不受马克思主义认识论管辖的独立王国，多年来，周扬一直在宣扬着所谓形象思维论。在苏联文艺界的修正主义者大肆宣扬形象思维论之后，周扬对形象思维论的鼓吹就更起劲了。在一九五九年全军二届文艺汇演大会干部座谈会上，特别在一九六一年六月文艺工作座谈会上，他突出地强调了这个所谓形象思维。他说：“如果我们讲文艺特殊规律的话，恐怕就是一个形象思维的问题。不注意形象思维，就要引导到概念化。”什么是形象思维呢，周扬说：“形象思维和逻辑思维是两种东西……搞理论靠概念，搞概念的人，就容易搞逻辑思维；搞艺术的人就容易搞形象思维。”这就是说，文艺作家是按照与一般认识规律不同的特殊规律认识事物、进行创作的。这样就给那些反对党的领导、反对马克思主义理论指导的一些文艺家，提供了理论的武器。而周扬也正是为了这个目的，在这个时期特别提倡形象思维论的。在一九六一年以后，文艺界的牛鬼蛇神向无产阶级发动了进攻。形象思维论的提倡，对这种进攻起了鼓动作用。
    周扬从外国资产阶级和修正主义那里，搬运来一些所谓理论。他认为文艺这件事，只是“一个形象、一个情感”的问题，他说“这个情感”，“它比理论还真”。这就是说，情感是超越理性的。作家有了这种“情感”就可以搞好创作。他反对作家创作先有主题思想，他说：“不要一写先就搞一个主题思想，不要开始就想到要写一个什么战略思想。”他的这种主张，就是在创作中不要在实践的基础上所产生的理性认识，反对马克思主义理论的指导。
    周扬所提倡的形象思维论是一种排斥理性的神秘主义和蒙昧主义的理论，它是现代修正主义文艺思潮的一个认识论基础，是直接反对毛泽东同志的《实践论》的。这种所谓形象思维在世界上是根本不存在的。但是，他却蛮横地宣称：“形象思维，谁也推翻不了。”由于他是文艺领域的“最高权威”，所以这种反动理论，竟然流行在所有大学的文学教科书中，流行在广大的文艺界人士中，并列入新出版的《辞海》，被认为是真理。对于形象思维论的详细批判，我已经发表了《文艺领域里必须坚持马克思主义的认识论》的文章（见《红旗》第五期）。这篇文章，就是反对周扬所提倡的形象思维论的。由于当时的具体情况，没有直接点出周扬的名字。就这样，这篇文章于一九六三年二月送到他们那里以后，还被他们扣押了两年又八个月。
    以上就是根据我们所接触到的材料，归纳出来的周扬反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的“十大罪状”，这里他在组织路线上的宗派主义还未算在内。从此可以看出：周扬是钻进我们党内的资产阶级代表人物，是文艺界黑线的主帅，是死心塌地的修正主义分子，是文化工作领域中的一个大恶霸。
    事情是偶然的吗？不！周扬从来就是一个机会主义分子。《解放军报》的社论指出：在三十年代，左翼文艺运动政治上前期是王明的“左”倾机会主义路线，后期是王明的右倾投降主义路线；组织上是关门主义和宗派主义；文艺思想实际上是俄国资产阶级文艺评论家别林斯基、车尔尼雪夫斯基、杜勃罗留波夫等的思想。这就是对三十年代的周扬的历史总结。在抗日战争期间，周扬顽固地坚持他的资产阶级文艺路线，为此，毛泽东同志曾经对他进行过多次的批评。建国以来，他表面上表示拥护毛泽东思想，实际上却反对毛泽东思想，仍然坚持用资产阶级的思想和理论来指导我们无产阶级文艺运动。不同的是，他又接受了现代修正主义的文艺思想，这就更具有时代特色。
    问题的严重性在于，周扬是文艺工作的主要领导人，他在文艺界，扶植亲信，排斥异己，造成了一种“顺我者昌，逆我者亡”的局面。在他的周围，纠集了一批“参谋”和“战将”，而在各个地方文艺组织中，又安插着他们的一些“督军”和“镇守使”。这样，在全国文艺界，就形成了一条又粗、又长、又深的黑线系统。周扬这个主帅，便可登高一呼，八方响应，兴风作浪，为所欲为。今天，他们在文艺上贯彻一条修正主义路线，一旦时机成熟，他们就会在政治上搞资本主义复辟。殷鉴不远，对这种危险，我们是万万不可忽视的。
    当前，我国的无产阶级文化大革命，是意识形态领域里无产阶级与资产阶级的尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，是资产阶级复辟与无产阶级反复辟的你死我活的斗争。在文艺领域，粉碎以周扬为首的这条反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的黑线，是这场革命不容稍缓的一个战斗任务。我们必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，向周扬这个文艺界的资产阶级头号代表人物猛烈开火。剥掉他身上的画皮，彻底打垮这一伙黑帮，扫清他们所散播的毒雾，把我们的文艺工作真正放在毛泽东思想的指导之下！
    伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
