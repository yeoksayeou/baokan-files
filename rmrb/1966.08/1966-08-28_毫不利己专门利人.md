	III. Explanation
	Now, let's study the article "In Memory of Norman Bethune."

	In December 1939, Chairman Mao wrote the famous article "In Memory of Norman Bethune" to commemorate Comrade Norman Bethune. The quotation we are studying tonight is taken from this article by Chairman Mao. The central idea of this quotation is to urge us to learn from Comrade Norman Bethune's spirit of selflessly devoting himself to others and his communist spirit.

	Who was Comrade Norman Bethune? Comrade Norman Bethune was a Canadian, a Communist Party member, and a renowned doctor. In 1937, when he was over fifty years old, he came to China at the request of the Canadian Communist Party and the American Communist Party to help the Chinese people in their war against Japan. On November 12, 1939, he unfortunately died from poisoning while treating wounded soldiers of the Eighth Route Army. He devoted his precious life to the cause of liberating the Chinese people.

	Chairman Mao said: "Comrade Norman Bethune's spirit of selflessly devoting himself to others is expressed in his extreme sense of responsibility to his work and his extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the people." When Comrade Norman Bethune came to China to fight against Japan, as soon as he arrived in the liberated areas, he immediately went to the front lines of the anti-Japanese war. In the midst of gunfire and shelling, he fearlessly rescued wounded soldiers of the Eighth Route Army. The more difficult the work, the more he was willing to take on the responsibility. He cared for the wounded and sick more than he cared for himself. Once, during a battle, he was treating wounded soldiers in a dilapidated temple. Suddenly, a shell exploded behind the operating room, shaking the temple's tiles. At that time, his comrades, for his safety, advised him to move to the rear to perform surgery. Comrade Norman Bethune calmly said: "The soldiers in front are fighting fiercely with the enemy. My responsibility is to rescue the wounded. We absolutely cannot leave our posts for our own safety." Once, to save a wounded soldier, it was decided to give him a blood transfusion. His comrades considered that he was too old and his health was not good, so they all opposed him giving blood. At this time, Comrade Norman Bethune solemnly said: "The soldiers on the front lines can shed blood and sacrifice their lives for the country and the nation! I am working in the rear, giving a little blood, what is wrong with that?... Now, we cannot delay any longer. Saving the wounded is urgent. Come on! Let's get to work!" With that, he extended his thin, vein-covered arm. In this way, Comrade Norman Bethune's 300 cubic centimeters of blood gave a second life to a severely wounded soldier of the Chinese people. Comrade Norman Bethune cared for the wounded and sick with meticulous attention, but his own life was extremely hard. The Party, to take care of his health, gave him a monthly allowance of 100 yuan. But he immediately wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, suggesting that this money be used as nutritional funds for the wounded. His reason was that the Eighth Route Army's soldiers only had 5 fen for their daily vegetables, and he, as a communist warrior, should not have any special privileges. Community members, you see, Comrade Norman Bethune's spirit of selflessly devoting himself to others is so moving! It is so worthy of our learning! Our great leader Chairman Mao taught us in the article "In Memory of Norman Bethune": "An foreigner, with no selfish motives, regards the cause of liberating the Chinese people as his own cause. What kind of spirit is this? This is the spirit of internationalism, this is the spirit of communism. Every Chinese Communist Party member should learn from this spirit." Chairman Mao taught us to learn from his selfless and devoted spirit, to be a person who benefits the people. Community members, we must listen to Chairman Mao's words and seriously learn from Comrade Norman Bethune's communist spirit.

	Community members, everyone knows that after our brigade studied Chairman Mao's works, the spiritual outlook of our community members is changing, and good people and good deeds are emerging in large numbers. Some outstanding examples include Chen Daguan, who once found a bulging wallet in Shidian Market and immediately handed it over to the commune without even looking inside. The commune cadres opened it to find nearly 100 yuan. Another example is Huang Yunhui, who once found a shirt in the village with a pen and over 30 yuan in the pocket. He chased the owner for five or six miles and finally caught up with him to return the item. Another example is Cai Huajun, who once found a watch in the village during a movie screening and immediately handed it over to the brigade. The owner (a female comrade from the Organizational Department of Boluo County Committee) was very moved when she retrieved it. Another example is Chen Renyun, who saw that the production team lacked production funds and voluntarily contributed 50 yuan from his savings to buy fertilizer for the production team. When he saw that the production team's pigs lacked feed, he broke the old custom of not grinding grain on the first day of the year and voluntarily took 100 pounds of rice to the production team to grind, solving the problem of pig feed for the production team. He also firmly refused to have the team record his work points or give him any reward. Many community members, in order to improve collective production, have voluntarily returned their excess private plots to the production team. These are all manifestations of the communist spirit and are very commendable phenomena that we should greatly promote.

	However, some of our community members, if we compare them with Comrade Norman Bethune's spirit, fall far short. For example, in their attitude towards the relationship between the individual and the collective, they are exactly the opposite of Comrade Norman Bethune, thinking only of themselves and "putting themselves first in every matter." Some community members, for the sake of their private plots, plow their land in the morning with the brigade's oxen, and in the afternoon, under the scorching sun, take the oxen to plow their own wasteland, not even giving the oxen any feed, leaving them to bake in the sun. Some community members, when transplanting rice seedlings, for the sake of earning more work points, do not pay attention to specifications and quality. Some community members, when doing work, pick the easy jobs, leaving the convenient ones for themselves and pushing the difficult ones onto others. Community members, what kind of thinking is this? This is the selfish, bourgeois thinking of harming the public for private gain. The bourgeois worldview is: "If one does not act for oneself, one will be punished by heaven and earth." We must eliminate this bourgeois thinking of harming the public for private gain. Because if we allow this thinking to exist, it will harm both the collective and oneself. As the saying goes: "When the big river rises, the small river is full." If the collective is not doing well, how can the individual be doing well? To improve our production team and develop collective production, we must resolutely eliminate this selfish, bourgeois thinking.

	Community members, we must read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. To learn and apply, to speak and act, we must constantly and unremittingly struggle against the "self" in our minds. Only by eliminating selfishness can we establish public-mindedness, and the more thoroughly we eliminate it, the more firmly we can establish it. We must do as Chairman Mao taught: "Care for others more than for oneself," endure hardships first and enjoyments later, sacrifice oneself for others, and help others with joy. We must correctly handle the relationship between the individual and the collective, the individual and the collective with the country, and put the collective interests and national interests first. We must have the spirit of being in the countryside but thinking of the whole country, and looking at the world. As long as we constantly use Comrade Norman Bethune's communist spirit as a mirror, constantly examine and reflect on ourselves, eliminate bourgeois thinking, and promote proletarian thinking, then we can gradually establish the spirit of selflessly devoting oneself to others, become a noble person, a pure person, a person of virtue, a person who has transcended low-level interests, and a person who benefits the people.

    毫不利己专门利人
    讲课人：黄坑生产队辅导员、贫农　陈寿清
    毛主席语录
    白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。每个共产党员都要学习他。
                        《纪念白求恩》
    一、提问（复习、启发）
      （1）上次学的《愚公移山》这篇文章的核心观点是什么？（社员回答）
      （2）我们要向“愚公”学习些什么？（社员回答）
    二、读语录（先示范读，后领读）
    三、讲解
    现在，我们来学《纪念白求恩》这篇文章。
    毛主席在一九三九年十二月二十一日为纪念白求恩同志，写了《纪念白求恩》这篇著名的文章。我们今晚学习的这条语录，就是从毛主席的这篇文章中摘出来的。这条语录的中心思想，就是要我们学习白求恩同志的毫不利己专门利人的共产主义精神。
    白求恩同志是一个什么样的人呢？白求恩同志是加拿大人，一个共产党员，著名的医生。一九三七年当他五十多岁的时候，他为了帮助中国人民抗日，受加拿大共产党和美国共产党的派遣，不远万里来到中国。一九三九年十一月十二日，因医治八路军伤员，不幸中毒牺牲。为了中国人民的解放事业，贡献了他的宝贵生命。
    毛主席说：“白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。”白求恩同志来到中国抗日，一到解放区后，就立即到抗日最前线，在枪林弹雨中，为抢救八路军伤员，不怕牺牲，工作越是困难的地方，他越是要去，勇于挑重担子，关心伤病员比关心自己还重。在一次战斗中，他在一间破庙里抢救伤员，忽然，一颗炮弹在手术室的后面爆炸，震得庙宇的瓦片格格作响。当时同志们为了他的安全，劝他转移到后方去做手术。白求恩同志沉着地说：前面战士们同敌人打得很激烈，我的责任就是抢救伤员，我们绝不能为了自己的安全就离开工作岗位。有一次，为了抢救一个伤员，决定输血时，同志们考虑他的年纪太大了，而且身体又不大好，因此都不同意他输血。这时，白求恩同志严肃地说：“前方将士为了国家民族，可以流血牺牲！我在后方工作，拿出一点点血，有什么不应该的呢？……现在，不能再耽搁时间了。抢救伤员要紧，来！快动手吧！”说罢，便伸出了他那很多青筋的瘦弱的手臂。就这样，白求恩同志的三百立方厘米血液，使一个受重伤的中国人民战士获得了第二次生命。白求恩同志对伤病员无微不至地关怀，可是他自己的生活却非常艰苦。党为了照顾他的健康，每月给他一百元津贴费。但他马上写信给毛主席，建议把这笔钱作为伤员的营养费。他的理由是八路军指战员每天的菜金只五分钱，而自己是一个共产主义战士，不应有特殊的享受。社员们，你们看，白求恩同志这种毫不利己专门利人的精神是多么感动人啊！多么值得我们学习啊！我们的伟大领袖毛主席在《纪念白求恩》这篇文章中教导我们说：“一个外国人，毫无利己的动机，把中国人民的解放事业当作他自己的事业，这是什么精神？这是国际主义的精神，这是共产主义的精神，每一个中国共产党员都要学习这种精神。”毛主席教导我们要学习他那种毫不利己专门利人的高尚品德，做一个有益于人民的人。社员们，我们一定要听毛主席的话，认真学习白求恩同志的共产主义精神。
    社员们，大家都知道，我们大队的社员在大学毛主席著作以后，精神面貌正在发生变化，好人好事大批出现。比较突出的事例，比如陈大群，一次到石坝墟拾到一个胀鼓鼓的钱包，他连看也没有打开来看，便立即交到公社去。公社干部打开一看，内有人民币近百元。又如黄运桂，一次在村里拾到一件衫，衫的口袋里有一支钢笔，还装有人民币三十多元，他专程追赶了五、六里路，终于赶上失主，交还原物。又如蔡华俊，一次在村里看电影时拾到一个手表，也马上交到大队，失者（博罗县委组织部的一位女同志）领回时，十分感动。又如陈壬运，看到生产队缺乏生产资金，他便主动拿出自己的存款五十元，投资给生产队买肥料。他看到生产队的猪缺乏饲料时，又打破年初一不磨谷的旧习惯，主动到生产队领了一百斤稻谷来磨，解决了生产队的猪饲料问题，他还坚决不要队里给他记工分，不要报酬。又如许多社员，为了搞好集体生产，都纷纷把超过规定的自留地交回给生产队。这些，都是共产主义精神的一种表现，是十分可喜的现象，值得我们大大加以发扬。
    可是，我们还有些社员，如果拿白求恩同志的精神对照一下，那就差得很远了。比如，他们在对待个人和集体的关系上，刚好和白求恩同志相反，一心只是想着为个人，“一事当前，先替自己打算”。有的社员为了搞自留地，生产队的耕牛上午才耙了田，中午日头又十分热，还牵牛去犁自己的开荒地，使了后也不给牛吃草料，把牛放在外面任日头晒。有些社员在插秧时，为了多赚工分，不讲规格质量。有些社员做工作，挑肥拣瘦，只拣好的工做，把方便留给自己，把困难推给人家。社员们，这是什么思想在作怪呢？这就是自私自利、损公利私的资产阶级思想。资产阶级的世界观就是：“人不为己，天诛地灭”。我们一定要破除损公利私这种资产阶级思想。因为这种思想如果让它存在下去，那就会既害了集体，也害了自己。俗话说：“大河水涨小河满”。集体搞不好，个人怎么会好呢？要搞好我们的生产队，发展集体生产，我们就必须坚决去掉这种自私自利的资产阶级思想。
    社员们，我们要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。要学到用到，说到做到，就必须经常不断地同自己脑子里的“私”字作斗争。只有破私才能立公，破得越彻底，立得也就越牢固。我们要做到“关心他人比关心自己为重”，吃苦在前，享受在后，舍己为人，助人为乐。我们要正确处理好个人同集体，个人、集体同国家的关系，要把集体利益和国家利益放在第一位，做到身在农村，胸怀全国，放眼世界。只要我们经常以白求恩同志的共产主义精神作镜子，不断对照检查自己，灭资产阶级思想，兴无产阶级思想，那么，我们就可以逐步树立起毫不利己专门利人的共产主义精神，做一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。
    四、讨论
    白求恩同志的共产主义精神表现在哪里？我们要怎样学习他的精神？
    五、小结（略）
