Farmers in the suburbs of Wuhan, under the leadership of the city's state-owned aquaculture farm, began breaking ice to catch fish on January 4th. By the evening of the 7th, the first batch of 30,000 jin of fresh fish had been caught, and fresh lake fish began to be available in the market on the 8th. After January 10th, the fish catching work in the suburbs will be fully launched to ensure the supply of fresh fish during the Spring Festival.

The Wuhan area experienced heavy snowfall around New Year's Day, and all lakes and ponds were frozen, completely cutting off the supply of lake fish to the market. The Wuhan City State-Owned Aquaculture Farm mobilized farmers to break ice and catch fish starting on the 4th, and decided to start with West Lake and Tazi Lake in the Huiji District. The farmers in the Huiji District actively participated in this work. At the beginning, the ice breaking work encountered many difficulties. The seven or eight-inch-thick ice was very difficult to break open, but after it was broken, it would freeze over again overnight. Liu Shangxiong and other workers from the aquaculture farm, seeing this situation, rowed boats and persisted in oscillating back and forth on the water surface of the broken ice in the low temperature of minus ten degrees Celsius at night, finally overcoming this difficulty.

    农民破冰捕鱼供应城市需要
    武汉市郊区农民在市国营养殖场领导下，从一月四日起，展开破冰捕鱼工作。到七日晚已捕起第一批鲜鱼三万余斤，八日市场上已开始有新鲜湖鱼供应。一月十日以后，郊区的捕鱼工作将全部开展起来，以保证春节期间的鲜鱼供应。
    武汉地区在元旦前后普降大雪，所有的湖塘都已结冰，市场湖鱼供应完全断绝。武汉市国营养殖场从四日起，发动农民破冰捕鱼，并决定先开惠济区的西湖、塔子湖。惠济区的农民积极参加了这一工作。开始，破冰工作遇到了许多困难。七、八寸厚的冰，很不容易打开，可是打开以后，过一夜又都冻上了。养殖场的工人刘尚雄等，看到这种情况，就划着船坚持在夜晚零下十度以下的低温中，在打开冰的水面上来回荡漾，终于克服了这一困难。
