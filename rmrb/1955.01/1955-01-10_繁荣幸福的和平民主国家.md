Soviet Primary and Secondary School Students Enjoy Winter Vacation

Soviet primary and secondary school students have been on winter vacation for more than a week. During these days, all cultural palaces, workers' clubs, and rural clubs throughout the country are open to children. In the Young Pioneer Palaces, the lights of New Year's fir trees are shining everywhere, and the children's songs and laughter are everywhere.

The Moscow Kremlin has already received approximately 40,000 Young Pioneers and students. An average of 5,000 children gather in the Georgievsky Hall of the Kremlin every day to celebrate the New Year's Fir Tree Festival. Many of them are students from cities across the country who have come to Moscow for vacation. There, they enjoy the wonderful performances of hundreds of artists from Moscow and enjoy dancing and games to their heart's content. They also celebrate with more than 500 students, teachers, and art workers from 26 countries, including China, Vietnam, France, the United States, India, and Burma.

Many winter Young Pioneer camps have been set up in picturesque places in the countryside, on the shores of huge reservoirs, and in forests covered with snow. Senior primary and secondary school students spend their holidays in the fresh air and skiing. Many skating rinks, gymnasiums, and indoor swimming pools are holding competitions.

All theaters and cinemas are hospitably open to children. Many children visit museums and art galleries that preserve Russian artistic treasures.

The Soviet Union Will Publish Twenty-Four New Magazines

The Soviet Union will publish twenty-four new magazines in 1955. The total number of magazines published in the Soviet Union in the languages of various nationalities will reach more than 670, which is equivalent to one and a half times the number before the Great Patriotic War. The circulation of these magazines will exceed 17 million copies. This was stated to a TASS reporter by B. Stepanov, Director of the General Administration of the Soviet Press Union (an organization promoting newspapers and magazines).

Stepanov said: Three of the twenty-four newly published magazines are literary publications. Among them, the monthly "Foreign Literature" will publish the most famous works of foreign writers and news about foreign literary life.

The quarterly "Friendship of Nationalities" will be changed to a monthly publication. This magazine will be devoted to publishing new works by writers from various fraternal republics translated into Russian.

The publishing house of the Soviet Academy of Sciences will publish several new journals, one of which is "Soviet Oriental Studies." This magazine will publish articles and materials studying the history and culture of Soviet Eastern countries and other countries in the East.

Due to the significant importance of the industrialized construction methods currently being promoted in the Soviet construction industry, the Soviet Union will also publish two magazines on construction: "Concrete and Reinforced Concrete" and "Building Materials, Components, and Structures."

In addition, the new magazines include the monthly "Youth" specifically for young readers and publications on health issues, etc.

Polish Workers Report Production Successes in the New Year

In the first few days of the new year, workers in many industrial sectors in Poland sent the first good news from the production front to the whole country. Many factories and mines have exceeded their production targets for the first few days of the new year.

In the steel industry, the "Bobrek" steel factory produced 138 tons of pig iron, 408 tons of steel, and 70 tons of coke for the state in the first four days of the new year, exceeding its plan. The Skawina aluminum plant completed 104 percent of its production plan in the first three days of the new year.

In the mining industry, the Wisela coal mine mined 528 tons of coal in excess of its plan in the first two days of the new year alone, and the Julian coal mine in Krakow Province mined 279 tons of coal in excess of its plan on the first day of the new year.

During the film festival, Polish audiences can see the Chinese films "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," "Marriage," and "Chicken Feather Letter," which are being released for the first time, as well as the thirteen Chinese art films that have been shown before.

Sales of Goods in Romania Increase Greatly

M. Oprisan, Minister of Internal Trade of Romania, told a TASS reporter: Romania began to abolish the rationing system on December 26, 1954, creating favorable conditions for improving the supply to residents. The daily sales volume of food and consumer goods has increased greatly. State-owned and cooperative trade organizations completed 109 percent of their December 1954 plan. In the first few days of this year, their turnover increased by approximately 30 percent compared to the same period last year. Since the abolition of the rationing system, residents' demand for high-quality goods has also increased.

The abolition of the rationing system and the implementation of unified national prices also have a positive impact on the prices in farmers' markets. Currently, the prices of meat, oils, dairy products, eggs, poultry, and corn are also lower than before.

More than 1,000 new state-owned stores were established in 1954. In December alone, more than 40 new state-owned stores selling food and consumer goods were established in Bucharest, Timisoara, and Balad.

Romania Strengthens Foreign Cultural Ties

The People's Republic of Romania is constantly strengthening cultural ties and exchanges with countries around the world.

From 1949 to 1954, a total of more than 9.8 million copies of classical and modern world literary masterpieces were published in Romanian. New translations of works by Shakespeare, Hugo, Pushkin, Lermontov, Nekrasov, Mayakovsky, Goethe, Dreiser, and other writers are currently being prepared for publication.

In concerts and radio programs held in Romania, the works of world-renowned composers such as Beethoven, Chopin, Mozart, Glinka, Borodin, Rimsky-Korsakov, Dvořák, and other famous composers often occupy an important position. The radio program for the first quarter of 1955 includes twenty world classical plays. Romanian cinemas regularly show films from the Soviet Union, China, France, Britain, Italy, Poland, Czechoslovakia, India, and other countries.

In the past five years, the Romanian Association for the Dissemination of Scientific and Cultural Knowledge has held tens of thousands of lectures and seminars introducing the cultural and scientific achievements of people from various countries.

The library of the Romanian Academy of Sciences now maintains contact with 1,750 scientific institutions in the Soviet Union, people's democracies, and capitalist countries, and exchanges books. The Romanian Academy of Sciences regularly sends academy publications to relevant scientific institutions in fifty countries.

Bulgaria's Machine Manufacturing Industry Develops Rapidly

Bulgaria's machine manufacturing output in 1954 increased by 7.8 times compared to 1948. During this period, Bulgaria has mastered the production of 420 new machines that had not been produced before and the production of more than 2,000 parts. These include the latest machine tools, diesel engines, compressors, high-pressure and low-pressure steam boilers, water pumps with a pumping capacity of 30,000 cubic meters per minute, concrete mixers, drilling machines, crushers, rock loading machines, and transportation equipment. In the early days of liberation, all agricultural machines and even parts required by Bulgaria had to be imported from foreign countries. Now, Bulgaria is able to produce 30 kinds of agricultural machines. In 1954, the machine manufacturing industry supplied more than 20,000 agricultural machines to agriculture, including combines, tractor-drawn plows, cultivators, and seed drills.

In terms of electrical equipment production, Bulgaria has established a number of large-scale electrical industrial enterprises. They produce various generators, electrical medical equipment, and movie projectors. Compared to 1948, Bulgaria's output of electric irons, electric pots, electric stoves, and electric washing machines increased by 55 percent in 1954. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
