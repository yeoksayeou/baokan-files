    Consolidate Labor Discipline, Safeguard National Construction
    Discussion on the Cases of Li Haishan and Yu Baofa Published in This Newspaper on December 20th Last Year
    Lessons from the Yu Baofa Case
    Fan Baozhong, Young Worker, Boiler Workshop, Shijingshan Power Plant
    I am a young worker in the boiler workshop of the Shijingshan Power Plant. After I saw the report in the People's Daily about the boiler water tank explosion accident at the Zhenjiang Hydropower Plant, I felt very sad. The case of Yu Baofa, a young worker at the Zhenjiang Hydropower Plant, should serve as a warning to each of us young workers.
    After Yu Baofa entered the factory, he did not first humbly learn what he did not understand, nor did he properly accept the help and education from the leadership. Instead, he was arrogant and looked down on the old workers. His goal was not to train himself into an excellent worker, but to enthusiastically pursue wearing narrow-legged pants, wearing pointed-toe leather shoes, dancing, eating in restaurants, and dressing up so that "the less others could tell he was a worker, the better." In production, he would arrive late, leave early, damage tools and equipment, and violate regulations. As a result, he caused a serious water tank explosion accident and was punished by national law.
    Young workers with Yu Baofa's thinking are not very uncommon in industrial and mining enterprises now. They have been contaminated by the bad habits of the old society, lack the training of collective labor, and after entering the factory, they lack good education. As a result, these young workers cannot progress quickly. They usually only talk about eating, dressing, and playing. They think they are more educated than the old workers, look down on them, are arrogant and conceited, do not accept criticism, do not respect their masters, do not obey commands, and arbitrarily violate regulations. Our factory recently disciplined such a young worker named Wu Zongyao. His wrong thoughts and behaviors were exactly the same as Yu Baofa. In the end, he was punished for damaging the electric sieve.
    The Yu Baofa case is a concrete and profound education for us workers, especially young workers. I think we should use it as a mirror to examine ourselves carefully and earnestly improve our shortcomings. We young workers are the most valuable new force in the country. The happy socialist society will be built by our generation. Today, we should make a hundred times more efforts to learn technology, improve our awareness, and train ourselves into truly excellent workers. Taking myself as an example, I still have many shortcomings, especially after learning a little bit of technology, I have developed a sense of complacency and am not humble towards my teachers. This has affected my progress and also makes it easy to be careless in production. From the Yu Baofa incident, I have a deeper understanding of my shortcomings and am determined to overcome them and contribute my strength to our country's socialist industrialization.
    Two Shortcomings in Enterprise Management
    Song Wenying, Shift Leader, Boiler Workshop, Shijingshan Power Plant
    The report in the People's Daily about the young worker Yu Baofa of the Zhenjiang Hydropower Plant violating labor discipline is very enlightening to us. The water tank explosion accident that occurred in the Zhenjiang Hydropower Plant was entirely man-made and could have been completely avoided. The young worker Yu Baofa should bear direct responsibility for the occurrence of this accident. However, it can be seen from this report that there are also serious shortcomings in the labor discipline work of the Zhenjiang Hydropower Plant.
    The labor discipline work of the Zhenjiang Hydropower Plant is in a state of no one being responsible. Yu Baofa has always disobeyed production order, why didn't anyone criticize or stop him? He constantly caused trouble in his work, why hasn't he been dealt with? Without strict labor discipline, normal production cannot be guaranteed. This is the most fundamental principle in our factory and is something that every worker should know at least. Especially in power plants, lax labor discipline will produce the most serious consequences.
    It can be seen from the report that the Zhenjiang Hydropower Plant also lacks complete rules and regulations and a system of responsibility, which is an important reason for the relaxation of labor discipline. In a modern factory like ours, without strict rules and regulations, safe production cannot be guaranteed. A small mistake in one person's operation can cause a dangerous accident. The direct cause of the accident caused by Yu Baofa was that he did not follow any regulations. No one supervised or inspected his work. When the head of the boiler workshop, Lin Genglai, discovered Yu Baofa's incorrect operation, he did not immediately handle it correctly, but instead asked Yu Baofa to tell the fireman Fang Shusheng. These are all concrete manifestations of the lack of a strict system of responsibility. What is even more serious is that Lin Genglai casually removed the safety valve of the water tank. In our factory, just to move the safety valve requires the approval of the chief engineer, how can it be removed casually?
    Last June, our factory also had a major accident. The direct cause was only due to the incorrect replacement of a fuse, which resulted in the explosion of the oil switch, causing a major power outage throughout the factory, and causing accidents in other fraternal factories in the entire power grid, which brought the work of many factories and construction sites in the capital to a standstill, causing incalculable losses. Therefore, every worker and factory leader should carefully study and implement the Outline of Internal Labor Rules for State-Owned Enterprises promulgated by the Government Administration Council. Only by strictly observing labor discipline and rules and regulations can we guarantee safe production and guarantee the victory of our socialist industrialization.
    Strengthening Political Work is Most Important
    Zhou Mingqin, Staff Member of the Party General Branch, Beijing Qinghe Woolen Mill
    The two articles published in the People's Daily on December 20, 1954, about employees violating labor discipline and causing serious accidents, deeply educated me. Although Yu Baofa and Li Haishan are members of the working class, they have been seriously influenced by bourgeois individualism. Their actions are all based on personal interests. They have no sense of responsibility to society or the collective. They work according to their personal preferences, disregarding the serious losses of state property and the personal danger of other worker comrades. They violate labor discipline and operating procedures, and finally degenerate from glorious workers to shameful criminals. This lesson is worth being painfully accepted by every factory employee. Political workers in industrial and mining enterprises should learn from it even more.
    At present, the main reason for the lax labor discipline in some enterprises is the influence of non-proletarian ideology on the masses of workers, and the weakness of political work in enterprises makes it impossible to eliminate this influence. Taking our factory as an example, the individualistic wrong thoughts of Yu Baofa and Li Haishan exist to varying degrees among many workers. For example, some young workers are arrogant and look down on the old masters, thinking that they are progressing quickly. Some old masters say: "In the old society, teaching apprentices meant starving the master; in the new society, teaching apprentices means angering the master. Once you teach him, he will ignore you." Some employees, in order to get more wages and bonuses, adopt despicable means of cheating and falsifying in production. Some workers, like Yu Baofa, do not appreciate the glorious title of the working class, despise labor, especially physical labor, "enduring their seniority" all day long, waiting to go to quick middle school, not studying technology, being late and leaving early, and even being absent from work. A small number of employees admire the lifestyle of the bourgeoisie, spending lavishly after receiving their salaries, and stealing things when they run out of money at the end of the month. There are also a small number of people, like Li Haishan, who do not study politics, do not want to attend meetings, and some do not want to read progressive books. There are also individual workers who draw turtles on other people's bodies during production time and tie the pigtails of female workers with wool, causing others to laugh and affecting production.
    Although our factory has done a lot of work in labor discipline and safe production, carried out many education sessions, and focused on criticizing the influence of capitalist ideology, the work is not detailed enough or in-depth enough. In particular, we have not mobilized the masses to regularly carry out criticism and self-criticism within the trade union groups, so the effect is not great. In the future, we will continue to carry out in-depth and meticulous ideological education in conjunction with the implementation of the Outline of Internal Labor Rules for State-Owned Enterprises, and consolidate labor discipline through competitions to avoid similar incidents like Yu Baofa and Li Haishan.

    巩固劳动纪律，维护国家建设事业
    关于去年十二月二十日本报刊登的李海山和郁宝发案件的讨论
    郁宝发案件的教训
    石景山发电厂锅炉车间青年工人  范宝仲
    我是石景山发电厂锅炉车间的青年工人。当我在人民日报上看到了镇江水电厂锅炉给水箱爆炸事故的报道以后，我心里感到很痛心。镇江水电厂青年工人郁宝发的案件，应该引起我们每个青年工人的警惕。
    郁宝发进厂以后，没有首先虚心地学习自己所不懂的东西，没有好好地接受领导上对他的帮助和教育，而是自高自大，看不起老工人。他努力的目标不是如何把自己锻炼成一个优秀的工人，而是热心于追求穿窄腿裤子，穿扁头皮鞋，跳舞，吃馆子，装扮得“越是别人看不出他是工人越好”。在生产上，则是晚上班、早下班、损坏工具设备，违犯规程制度。结果终于造成给水箱爆炸的严重事故，受到国家法律的制裁。
    有着郁宝发那种思想的青年工人，现在在工矿企业中并不是很个别的。他们沾染了旧社会的坏习气，缺乏集体劳动的锻炼，进入工厂后，又缺乏很好的教育，结果就使得这些青年工人不能很快进步，平日就是讲吃，讲穿，讲玩，对待老工人自以为文化程度高，看不起他们，高傲自大，不接受批评，不尊重师傅，不服从指挥，任意违犯规程。我们的工厂不久前就曾处分了这样一个青年工人，他叫吴宗耀，他的错误思想和行为简直和郁宝发一模一样，最后他因为破坏了电筛子而受到了处分。
    郁宝发案件，对我们工人，特别是青年工人，是一次具体深刻的教育，我觉得应该拿它作为镜子，好好的来照一照自己，切实的改进缺点。我们青年工人是国家最可宝贵的生力军，幸福的社会主义社会要在我们这一代的手里建设起来，我们今天应当百倍地努力学习技术，提高觉悟、把自己锻炼成了一个真正优秀的工人。拿我自己来说，在我身上也还存在着不少的毛病，特别是刚学了一点技术，就滋长了自满情绪，对老师傅便不虚心，这就影响了自己的进步、也容易在生产上疏忽大意。从郁宝发的事件中我更深刻的认识到自己的缺点，决心克服自己的缺点，为我们国家的社会主义工业化贡献自己的力量。
    企业管理的两个缺点
    石景山发电厂锅炉车间值班长  宋文英
    人民日报上发表的镇江水电厂青年工人郁宝发违反劳动纪律的报道，对我们启发很大。镇江水电厂所发生的给水箱爆炸事故完全是人为的，是完全可以避免而没有避免的。这件事故的发生，青年工人郁宝发要负直接的责任。但是从这篇报道中可以看出，镇江水电厂劳动纪律工作也是存在着严重缺点的。
    镇江水电厂的劳动纪律工作是处于无人负责的状态，郁宝发一贯不遵守生产秩序，为什么没人批评和制止？他在工作中不断出乱子，为什么一直没有处理？没有严格的劳动纪律，就不能保证正常的生产，这是我们工厂里最根本的一个道理。也是我们每一个工人起码应该懂得的。特别是发电厂，劳动纪律不严，就会产生最严重的后果。
    从报道中可以看出，镇江水电厂也缺乏完整的规程制度和责任制，这是造成劳动纪律松弛的重要原因。像近代化的工厂里，没有严格的规程制度，就不能保证安全生产。一个人出一点错误操作，就会造成危险的事故。郁宝发造成事故的直接原因就是他没有根据任何规程。他的工作也没有任何人监督检查，当锅炉工场场长林耕来发现郁宝发的错误操作以后，也没有马上进行正确的处理，而是让郁宝发去转告司炉方树生。这些都是没有严格的责任制的具体表现。更严重的是：林耕来随随便便就拆除了给水箱的安全阀，这在我们厂里，只要动一动安全阀，却必须经总工程师批准才行，又怎么能随便拆掉呢？
    去年六月，我厂也曾发生过一次重大事故，直接原因只是由于错误地更换了一根保险丝，结果引起了油开关爆炸，使全厂大停电，并引起了整个电力网其他各兄弟厂的事故，使首都的许多工厂和建设工地的工作陷于停顿，造成了无法计算的损失。所以，我们每一个工人和工厂的领导者，都应该很好的学习和执行政务院公布的国营企业内部劳动规则纲要。只有严格的遵守劳动纪律和规程制度，才能保证安全生产，才能保证我们社会主义工业化的胜利。
    加强政治工作最重要
    北京清河制呢厂党总支工作人员　周明琴
    一九五四年十二月二十日人民日报发表的两篇关于职工违反劳动纪律造成严重事故的文章，深深的教育了我。郁宝发与李海山虽然是工人阶级的一分子，但他们却受了资产阶级个人主义的严重影响，他们的所作所为，处处从个人出发，他们对社会对集体没有责任感，任凭他们个人的高兴去干活，因而不惜国家财产的严重损失，不惜其他工人同志的人身危险，违犯劳动纪律和操作规程，最后使自己由光荣的工人而堕落为可耻的罪人。这个教训，是值得每个工厂的职工沉痛接受的。工矿企业部门的政治工作者，更应当从中吸取教训。
    现在，企业中某些劳动纪律松弛的原因主要的是非无产阶级思想对工人群众的影响，而企业政治工作薄弱，使得这种影响不能肃清。就拿我厂来说，像郁宝发李海山这种个人主义的错误思想在不少工人中不同程度的存在着，例如有的青年工人自高自大，瞧不起老师傅，认为自己进步快，有些老师傅就说：“旧社会是教会徒弟，饿死师傅；新社会是教会徒弟，气死师傅。你教会了他，他就不理你了。”也有些职工，为了多得工资和奖励金，便在生产上采取欺骗造假的恶劣手段。有的工人也像郁宝发一样，没有体会到工人阶级的光荣称号，轻视劳动，特别轻视体力劳动，整天“熬工龄”，等着上速成中学，不钻研技术，迟到早退，甚至旷工。有个别的职工羡慕资产阶级的生活方式，发薪后大吃大喝，挥霍浪费，到月末没钱花了就偷东西。还有一小部分人，像李海山一样，不学习政治，不愿开会，有个别的不愿看进步书籍。也有个别工人，在生产时间给其他人身上画王八，把女工的小辫结上毛线，惹得别人发笑，影响生产。
    我厂在劳动纪律和安全生产方面，虽然作了不少工作，进行过许多次的教育，并集中的批判过资本主义思想影响，但是作的还不细致，不深入，尤其是没有发动群众在工会小组内经常地开展批评与自我批评，因而效果不大。今后我们要结合贯彻国营企业内部劳动规则纲要，继续进行深入细致的思想教育，通过竞赛来巩固劳动纪律，避免发生类似郁宝发和李海山的事件。
