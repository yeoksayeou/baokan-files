Xinhua News Agency, January 2nd: Calcutta Dispatch: Indian Prime Minister Nehru said at a press conference in Calcutta on the 1st that the Asian-African Conference to be held in April will help strengthen the cause of peace. Nehru said that the purpose of this conference is not to establish any bloc, but to bring countries closer together in order to understand each other and implement the greatest possible degree of cooperation, even if these countries are inconsistent on certain points.

Answering reporters' questions, Nehru again expressed regret over the United Nations General Assembly's resolution accusing China of violating the Korean Armistice Agreement by sentencing eleven American spies. He said that the United Nations made a certain decision in a one-sided way, and this attitude in handling the issue "seems unfortunate." Nehru said: "The Chinese position is this: these people have nothing to do with the Korean War, they are not prisoners of war in the Korean War at all. This is a matter of fact and needs to be resolved based on facts."

Nehru then said that there is no issue of China violating the armistice agreement, but there is another issue that the Chinese value very much, that is, thousands of Chinese prisoners of war in the Korean War were sent to Taiwan after the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission handed them over, even though "the commission had explicitly requested that these prisoners of war not be sent to Taiwan." Nehru believes this can be said to be a violation of the armistice agreement.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 2nd: Indonesian Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo said at a press conference on the 1st that the Bogor Conference successfully brought the People's Republic of China and Asian-African countries closer together, which is a victory for peace.

Speaking of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, he said: "As far as Indonesia is concerned, I am completely in favor of these principles, and I don't think anyone can oppose these principles."

He said that the success of the Bogor Conference is certainly a contribution to peace. Most importantly: the purpose of the Bogor Conference and the future Asian-African Conference is to promote friendship and cooperation between Asian and African countries. He said that the purpose of the Asian-African Conference is wholeheartedly supported by Indonesia and is fully in line with Indonesian policy.

He said that the efforts of Western countries to criticize and minimize the importance of the Bogor Conference and the Asian-African Conference are "irresponsible" and "disregard the development of world political affairs."

He also mentioned that the venue for the Asian-African Conference has been decided in Bandung, and a secretariat composed of representatives of the initiating countries has been established to prepare for the conference. The decision to invite twenty-five countries to participate in the conference is final, and invitations will be sent out as soon as possible. He said that Indonesia had contacted sixteen countries before the Bogor Conference, and the response from most of these countries was in favor of holding the Asian-African Conference.

    尼赫鲁说亚非会议会有助于加强和平事业
    印度尼西亚总理谈茂物会议的成就
    【新华社二日讯】加尔各答消息：印度总理尼赫鲁一日在加尔各答举行的记者招待会上说，将在四月间举行的亚非会议将有助于加强和平事业。尼赫鲁说，这个会议的目的不是要建立任何集团，而是使各国更加接近以便互相了解，并实行尽可能大的程度的合作，即使这些国家在某些点上是不一致的。
    尼赫鲁在回答记者的问题时再一次对联合国大会诬蔑中国判处十一名美国间谍案件为违反朝鲜停战协定的决议表示遗憾。他说，联合国通过片面的方式作出了某种决定，这种处理这个问题的态度
  “似乎是不幸的”。尼赫鲁说：“中国人的立场是这样：这些人和朝鲜战争毫不相干，他们根本不是朝鲜战争中的战俘。这是一个事实问题，需要根据事实来解决。”
    尼赫鲁接着说，并不存在中国违反停战协定的问题，倒是还存在着另一个为中国人非常重视的问题，那便是成千的朝鲜战争中的中国战俘在中立国遣返委员会把他们移交以后便被送往台湾，尽管“这个委员会曾明确地要求不要把这些战俘送往台湾”。尼赫鲁认为这倒是可以说是破坏停战协定的。
    【新华社雅加达二日电】印度尼西亚总理阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约在一日举行的记者招待会上说，茂物会议成功地使中华人民共和国和亚非国家更加接近，这是和平的胜利。
    他在谈到五项共处的原则时说：“就印度尼西亚而言，我是完全赞成这些原则的，我想没有一个人能够反对这些原则。”
    他说，茂物会议的成功对于和平当然是一种贡献。最重要的是：茂物会议和将来举行的亚非会议的目的都在于促进亚洲和非洲国家之间的友好和合作。他说，亚非会议的目的，是印度尼西亚所衷心赞成的，并且完全符合于印度尼西亚的政策。
    他说，西方国家批评和缩小茂物会议及亚非会议的重要性的努力是“不负责任的”和“漠视世界政治事态发展的”。
    他还说到，举行亚非会议的地点已经决定在万隆，并且已经着手成立一个由各发起国代表组成的筹备会议事项的秘书处。邀请二十五个国家参加会议的决定，是最后的决定，请柬将尽快发出。他说，印度尼西亚在茂物会议举行以前已经同十六个国家接触过，其中大部分国家的反应是赞成举行亚非会议。
