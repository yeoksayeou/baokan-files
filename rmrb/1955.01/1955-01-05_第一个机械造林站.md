    The Kaitong Mechanical Afforestation Experimental Station in Jilin Province was established in May 1953. It is the first mechanical afforestation station in our country. Its main task is to carry out mechanical afforestation experiments on saline-alkali wasteland in western Northeast China to create conditions for large-scale construction of a 3 million-hectare shelterbelt in western Northeast China in the future. Now this station has 21 tractors of various types, 30 tree planting machines and weeding machines, as well as many agricultural machines such as deep plows and disc harrows. By the end of last year, this station had afforested more than 120 hectares. At the beginning of the trial planting, the work efficiency was not high, and the superiority of mechanical afforestation could not be fully utilized. After careful research by the staff, the connecting rods on the machinery were modified, and the number of tree planting machines pulled by one tractor was increased from three to five, and the method of centralized supply of seedlings was also changed. Therefore, the work efficiency has been greatly improved, and one tractor has increased from planting eight hectares per day to fifteen hectares, which is thirty times more efficient than manual afforestation. Mechanical afforestation is not only fast, but also has a high survival rate of forest seedlings and grows quickly. The forest seedlings created by these machines have grown more than four feet high in one year, and the highest is more than six feet high, which is more than twice as fast as the growth rate of seedlings cultivated manually. At present, the station is conducting winter training, overhauling tractors, and surveying afforestation areas to prepare for afforestation of 1,000 hectares this year.

    第一个机械造林站
    吉林省开通机械造林试验站是在一九五三年五月成立的。这是我国第一个机械造林站。它的主要任务是在东北西部盐碱荒地上进行机械造林试验，为将来大规模营造东北西部三百万公顷防护林带创造条件。现在这个站已拥有各种拖拉机二十一台，植树机、除草机三十台，还有深耕犁、圆盘耙等许多农业机器。到去年底止，这个站已造林一百二十多公顷。在开始试植时工作效率不高，不能充分发挥机械造林的优越性。经过职工们的精心研究，改装了机械上的连接杆，由原来一台拖拉机牵引三台植树机增至牵引五台植树机，同时又改变了集中供应树苗的方法。因此，大大提高了工作效率，一台拖拉机由每日造林八公顷增至十五公顷，比人工造林效率高三十倍。机械造林不仅速度快，而且林苗成活率高，生长也快。这些机械营造的林苗，一年就长了四尺多高，最高的达到六尺多高，比用人工栽培的树苗生长速度快两倍以上。目前，该站正在进行冬训，检修拖拉机，勘察造林地区等工作，为今年造林一千公顷做好准备。
