Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 29th (TASS): The first session of the United Nations Advisory Committee for the preparation of the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy concluded in New York on January 28.

As is known, during the conference, the Soviet representative, Academician Skobeltsyn, proposed that the item "The First Soviet Atomic Energy Industrial Power Station and the Development Path of Atomic Power Technology" be included in the agenda of the international conference.

This proposal demonstrates the Soviet Union's commitment to promoting international cooperation in the peaceful utilization of atomic energy and its willingness to openly share the scientific and technological experience it has accumulated in this field. Despite attempts by the United States and representatives from some other countries to obstruct the inclusion of this significant issue for the peaceful utilization of atomic energy on the international conference's agenda, the issue was ultimately included.

It should be pointed out that, during the committee's meetings, there were attempts to narrow the scope of the committee's work, aiming to limit its role to formally adopting pre-prepared plans and rules of procedure for the international conference. The press believes that these attempts are related to the United States' desire to monopolize the conference's preparation and manipulate its proceedings without considering the opinions of other countries.

In this regard, it is worth noting that some important rules of procedure for the international conference, adopted by a mechanical majority by the Advisory Committee, possess characteristics rarely seen in general international conferences. For example, according to a rule adopted by the committee, the international conference has no right to determine its own working procedures. Furthermore, according to some rules adopted by the committee, the participants in the conference will essentially be deprived of the possibility of expressing their views on any issues regarding the conference's proceedings. At the same time, the chairperson of the conference and the heads of the conference's various groups have unusual and completely unrestricted rights to preside over the meetings, which will hardly contribute to a broad and comprehensive exchange of views, which such an international conference should conduct. The adoption of a special rule allowing for the arbitrary selection and rejection of reports submitted to the conference also demonstrates the peculiar nature of some of the rules of procedure adopted by the committee.

### 国际会议联合国谘询委员会第一期会议结束  苏联原子能电力站报告列入议程

    国际会议联合国谘询委员会第一期会议结束
    苏联原子能电力站报告列入议程
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社纽约二十九日讯：筹备和平利用原子能国际会议的联合国谘询委员会第一期会议已于一月二十八日在纽约结束。
    大家知道，在会议进行期间，苏联代表斯科贝尔琴院士曾经建议将“苏联第一个原子能工业电力站和原子能力学的发展道路”这一项目列入国际会议的议程。
    这个建议表明，苏联力求促进和平利用原子能方面的国际合作，并且准备公开苏联在这方面所累积的科学技术经验。尽管美国和其他一些国家的代表企图阻挠把这个对和平利用原子能具有重要意义的问题列入国际会议议程，但是这个问题终于列入了国际会议议程。
    应当指出，在委员会会议期间，曾经有人企图缩小委员会的工作范围，企图把它的作用仅限于形式上通过事先拟就的国际会议的计划和议事规则。新闻界认为，这种企图是同美国想不考虑其他国家的意见而包办会议的筹备工作、操纵会议的进程的企图有关的。
    关于这一点，值得注意的是，谘询委员会以机械多数所通过的国际会议的一些重要议事规则是具有一般的国际会议所少见的性质的。譬如，根据委员会通过的一项规则，国际会议没有权利决定自己的工作程序。此外，根据委员会所通过的一些规则，会议的参加者实质上将被剥夺对会议议事程序的任何问题表示自己意见的可能。同时，会议的主席和会议各小组的负责人却有异常的和完全不受限制的权利来主持会议，这样做很难有助于广泛和全面地交换意见，而这样交换意见是这样的国际会议所应该进行的。委员会通过了一项特别规则，规定可以任意取舍向会议提出的报告，这一点也证明了委员会所通过的一些议事规则奇异的性质。
