    南斯拉夫贝尔格莱德地方法院
    判处德热拉斯等人徒刑
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社贝尔格莱德讯：贝尔格莱德地方法院二十四日经审理后判处南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟前书记密洛凡·德热拉斯一年半徒刑，缓期执行；判处前中央委员弗拉吉米尔·杰吉耶尔六个月徒刑，缓期执行。
    根据贝尔格莱德地方法院对他们提起诉讼的决议，德热拉斯和杰吉耶尔的罪名是进行诽谤和敌视南斯拉夫的宣传。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟书记卡德尔曾经指出：德热拉斯曾经对美国“纽约时报”记者发表了一篇替那些不满意南斯拉夫目前外交政策的外国集团效劳的谈话。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟监察委员会也曾经指出：杰吉耶尔同德热拉斯一起，表示愿意为那些对南斯拉夫不友好的外国集团服务。
