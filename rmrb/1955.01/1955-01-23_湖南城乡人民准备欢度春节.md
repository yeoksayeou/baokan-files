	Hunan's urban and rural people are preparing to celebrate the Spring Festival. The Spring Festival慰问团 (comfort group) of the Dongting Lake construction site, composed of representatives from all walks of life in Hunan Province, with its seventy theatrical troupes and film projection teams, has already set off. They will perform various wonderful programs for the migrant workers repairing the Dongting Lake embankments. Many schools and factories in Changsha will also hold various ball games and track and field competitions during the Spring Festival. Many cadres, workers, students, and People's Liberation Army soldiers plan to visit Chairman Mao's hometown, Shaoshan Township in Xiangtan County, during the Spring Festival. Many factory workers in Changsha, Hengyang, Xiangtan, Zhuzhou and other cities plan to go to the countryside during the Spring Festival to visit agricultural production cooperatives and hold get-togethers with their farmer brothers. Workers at the local state-owned Jianxiang Machinery Factory have decided to invite members of fifty agricultural production cooperatives from Changsha County to visit the factory during the Spring Festival. This factory will trial-produce new agricultural implements this year. Amateur theatrical troupes in factories, government offices, and schools in various cities are rehearsing various cultural programs in preparation for performing during the Spring Festival. Employees of the state-owned Xiangzhong Electric Power Bureau have also created快板 (clapper talks) such as "Oppose the U.S.-Chiang Treaty" and "Resolutely Liberate Taiwan." In addition to their own performances, rural theatrical troupes in counties such as Changsha, Xiangtan, and Yueyang will also organize farmers to engage in folk recreational activities such as dragon lanterns, lions, and彩龙船 (color dragon boats) during the Spring Festival. The Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region will hold a region-wide performance of folk artists during the Spring Festival.
