Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: According to a TASS dispatch from Delhi on the 24th: The Chiang Kai-shek bandits fleeing within Burma are currently intensifying their activities. According to a report from the "Tolas" correspondent of the Indian News Agency in Rangoon, Kuomintang bandits ambushed a military truck of General Bo Niwen, commander-in-chief of the Burmese army, on the Keng Tung-Tachileik highway. The conflict resulted in the death of one Burmese soldier.

The Indian weekly "Blitz" published a report from Hong Kong stating that the Taiwan Kuomintang bandit gang is deeply disturbed by the Burmese government's plan to launch a large-scale offensive against the Kuomintang troops currently in Burma in the spring of 1955, fearing that it might lose an important springboard for attacking the mainland. The report also said that representatives of the Kuomintang Group Supreme Command and American representatives have secretly discussed the issue of Burma's planned offensive and have adopted a decision: to take urgent measures to strengthen the Kuomintang army's positions in Burma, planning to reinforce soldiers and officers from Taiwan. The "Nation" newspaper published in Rangoon reported that there are Americans among the members of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Burma.

    美国和蒋贼计划增援流窜缅甸的匪徒
    据新华社讯：据塔斯社德里二十四日电：流窜在缅甸境内的蒋介石匪徒最近正在加紧活动。据印度通讯社托辣斯驻仰光记者报道，国民党匪徒在缅甸军总司令波尼温将军卫兵的军用卡车所经过的景栋—塔契累克公路上设下埋伏。冲突的结果，有一名缅甸士兵死亡。
    印度“闪电”周报刊载的一条来自香港的消息说，台湾国民党匪帮对缅甸政府打算在一九五五年春季开始向现在缅甸境内的国民党军队发动大规模进攻一事深感不安，担心可能丧失进攻大陆的一个重要跳板。消息还说，国民党集团最高司令部代表和美国代表已经秘密讨论了关于缅甸打算发动进攻的问题，并且通过了一项决定：采取紧急措施来加强国民党军队在缅甸的阵地，计划从台湾增援士兵和军官。仰光出版的“民族报”报道，在缅甸的蒋介石匪徒的成员中有美国人。
