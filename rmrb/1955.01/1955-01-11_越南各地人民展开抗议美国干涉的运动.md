Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 10th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the movement of Vietnamese people protesting against American interference, which began last month, is expanding in various provinces and regions.

    In the Fifth Interzone of Central and Southern Vietnam, 35,000 farmers in the rural areas of Quang Ngai and Quang Binh provinces participated in mass rallies to support the statement submitted by Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong to the chairman of the Geneva Conference and General Vo Nguyen Giap's memorandum, protesting against the American conspiracy to sabotage peace.

    In Ha Dong City in North Vietnam, more than 10,000 people held a protest rally and parade on December 28th last year. On the same day, in the Phat Diem Diocese, 20,000 Catholics and non-Catholics held a rally condemning American interference. After the meeting, a parade was held, the procession stretching for three kilometers.

    At the meeting in Quang Yen Province to commemorate the anniversary of the founding of the Vietnam People's Army, more than 5,000 residents, soldiers, and cadres passed a resolution expressing their determination to fight to stop the American interventionists and their servants.

    In Haiphong, under French control, hundreds of people from all walks of life have written to President Ho Chi Minh, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Vietnam National United Front, expressing their determination to smash all the conspiracies of the American imperialists and their running dogs, and to prevent the Ngo Dinh Diem clique from moving machinery and public property from Haiphong.

    The Vietnamese people are demonstrating their determination to oppose American interference with practical actions. Workers at the Hanoi power plant worked hard, saving more than 550 work hours in five days. At the Hanoi-Nam Quan railway construction site, a team of workers in the An Vien section increased track laying by 200 meters per day. Six important water conservancy and irrigation systems in North Vietnam—Chu River, Cau River, Lien Son, Lien Mo, Du Luong, and Bac Giang—have all started releasing water for irrigation since January 1st, thanks to the enthusiastic efforts of the workers and farmers participating in the repair work.

    In the movement against American interference, staff members of many state organs have engaged in competitions to improve their work and promote the four virtues of diligence, thrift, integrity, and honesty. Students have also engaged in competitions to study hard in order to better serve the motherland in the future.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th: This agency has received a commentary published by the Vietnam News Agency on the 9th, stating: Recently, the American imperialists have intensified their shameless interference in South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.

    Since January 1st, the United States has obtained the right to directly train Bao Dai's army, with France playing a supporting role. They are directly giving aid to the Ngo Dinh Diem clique and the Royal Governments of Cambodia and Laos, thereby directly interfering in the resources of these places and infringing upon the interests of French merchants.

    The American imperialists are directing the reactionary ruling clique of Thailand to build many strategic highways on the borders of Cambodia and Laos, with the aim of facilitating the illegal transportation of weapons into these two countries.

    At the end of last December, American General Radford went to Saigon to instruct Collins and Ngo Dinh Diem to establish a police force to suppress the people, just as American imperialism is currently doing in the Philippines.

    On January 5th, the American warmongers sent Spellman, disguised in the robe of a "Cardinal," to Saigon to support Collins and Ngo Dinh Diem in sabotaging the Geneva Accords and accelerating the forced migration of Catholic residents from North Vietnam to South Vietnam.

    The American warmongers are preparing for a meeting of the Southeast Asia Aggression Bloc scheduled for next month in order to take further measures regarding the conspiracy to undermine peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

    President Ho Chi Minh, in his New Year's address, warned all the Vietnamese people that "we must maintain high vigilance and resolutely oppose the American imperialists' further interference in Indochina and their instigation of their running dogs to sabotage the armistice agreement and all conspiracies to undermine peace." In order to implement these instructions, the Vietnamese people will advance their struggle. Thanks to their own unity and the support of peace-loving people around the world, the Vietnamese people will surely smash the conspiracies of the American imperialists and their running dogs.

    越南各地人民展开抗议美国干涉的运动
    【新华社十日讯】　据越南通讯社河内九日讯：越南人民抗议美国干涉的运动从上月开始以来在各省、各地区日益扩大。
    在中越南部第五联区，广义、广平省的农村中有三万五千农民参加了群众大会，支持范文同外交部长提交日内瓦会议主席的声明和武元甲将军的备忘录，抗议美国破坏和平的阴谋。
    在北越河东市，有一万多人在去年十二月二十八日举行了抗议大会和游行。同一天，在发艳教区，二万名天主教徒和非教徒举行了谴责美国干涉行为的大会。会后举行游行，队伍长达三公里。
    在广安省纪念越南人民军建军节大会上，到会的五千多名居民、军人和干部通过决议，表示要为制止美国干涉者和它的仆从而斗争。
    在法军控制下的海防，先后已有各阶层人士数百人写信给胡志明主席、越南民主共和国政府和越南国民联合战线，表示要粉碎美帝国主义者和它的走狗的一切阴谋，并且阻止吴庭艳集团从海防搬走机器和公共财产。
    越南人民用实际行动来表示他们反对美国干涉的决心。河内发电厂工人努力工作，在五天中节省了五百五十多个工时。在河内—南关铁路工地，安员段的一队工人每天增加铺轨二百公尺。北越六个重要的水利灌溉系统——朱江、球河、联山、联模、都良、北江——在参加修复工作的工人和农民们的热情努力下，从一月一日起都已经开始放水灌溉。
    在反对美国干涉的运动中，许多国家机关的工作人员进行了竞赛，来改进工作，发扬勤劳、节俭、公正、诚实的四项美德。学生们也进行了努力学习的竞赛，以便将来更好地为祖国服务。
    【新华社十日讯】　此间收到越南通讯社九日发表的述评称：最近，美帝国主义者已经加紧它对南越、柬埔寨和老挝的无耻干涉。
    从一月一日起，美国已经取得了直接训练保大军队的权利，使法国担当辅助的角色。他们正把援助直接给予吴庭艳集团、柬埔寨和老挝的王国政府，从而对这些地方的资源可以直接染指，侵犯法国商人的利益。
    美帝国主义者正在指使泰国反动统治集团在柬埔寨和老挝的边境修建许多战略公路，目的在于便利向这两个国家非法运入武器。
    去年十二月底，美国将军雷德福到西贡指示柯林斯和吴庭艳建立警察部队以便镇压人民，正如美帝国主义目前在菲律宾所做的一样。
    一月五日，美国战争贩子们又把在“红衣主教”外衣的掩盖下的斯培尔曼派到西贡，目的在支持柯林斯和吴庭艳破坏日内瓦协议、加速强迫北越天主教居民向南越迁移的活动。
      美国战争贩子们正在准备预定在下月召开的东南亚侵略集团的会议，以便就破坏印度支那和东南亚和平的阴谋采取进一步的措施。
    胡志明主席在他的新年贺词中曾告诫全越南人民“必须保持高度警惕，坚决反对美帝国主义者进一步干涉印度支那、唆使他们的走狗破坏停战协定和破坏和平的一切阴谋诡计”。为了实现这些指示，越南人民将推进他们的斗争。由于自身的团结和得到世界上爱好和平人们的支持，越南人民定将粉碎美帝国主义者和他们的走狗的阴谋。
