    Vigorously Protect Draught Cattle in Disaster Areas Through the Winter
    Zheng Yu

    Last year, in provinces that suffered from floods, efforts were made to rescue draught cattle before the floods arrived, in accordance with the "Instructions on Rescuing Livestock in Flood-stricken Areas" issued by the Financial and Economic Committee of the former Central People's Government's Government Administration Council. Most areas completed the task, rescuing a large number of draught cattle. This was a great achievement in last year's production and disaster relief work. Currently, farmers in flood-stricken areas have returned to their villages to resume production, and most of the draught cattle that were moved out with the farmers have also been brought back to the disaster areas. How to continue to protect these draught cattle has become a serious problem in the disaster areas.

    Some flood-stricken areas have vigorously carried out the work of protecting draught cattle while leading farmers back to production, adopting various measures based on specific conditions to solve the problem of draught cattle overwintering. However, some disaster areas have not done this work well. The problems of draught cattle fodder and sheds have not been resolved, resulting in continuous deaths of draught cattle.

    There are many tasks in leading farmers in disaster areas to carry out production for self-salvation, such as solving the farmers' food problem, helping farmers build houses, and leading farmers in agricultural and sideline production. But while carrying out the above work, don’t neglect the protection of draught cattle. Because if the work of protecting cattle is not done well in winter, it will bring great difficulties to spring plowing. Some areas regard protecting cattle as "preserving the vitality" of farmers, which makes a lot of sense. Cadres and farmers in flood-stricken areas should have this understanding and regard today's cattle protection work as the work of preserving vitality for future agricultural production.

    The areas that suffered from floods last year were relatively large, some even severely affected. Protecting draught cattle in large and severely affected areas is difficult, but judging from the experience of areas that have already carried out this work, this difficulty can be overcome. Taking the problem of fodder shortage, which is a relatively common concern in various places, many areas have come up with effective solutions. Some areas use buckwheat stalks, bean stalks, sweet potato vines, potato stalks, rice husks, etc., to replace rice straw. Some areas organize farmers to collect large quantities of wild grass, lake grass, and leaves to solve the shortage of fodder. According to Hanyang County, Hubei Province, if only grain husks and rice straw are used as feed, it can only supply about two-thirds of the county's draught cattle. If crop stalks other than rice straw are used as substitute fodder, plus grazing, the fodder problem of all draught cattle can be solved. The widespread use of alternative feed is correct, but never use sweet potatoes with diseases and pests (with black spot disease, weevil infestation, dry rot, etc.) and moldy sweet potato vines and peanut vines to feed cattle. Last year, individual areas in Henan Province had cases of poisoning due to feeding cattle with bad sweet potatoes. Some areas have adopted methods such as mutual adjustment between households with cattle but lacking grass and households with grass but lacking cattle, joint feeding and shared use, borrowing grass and repaying with grass or money, which has also solved a large problem. Houzhai electoral district in Sixian County, Anhui Province, has twenty-four cattle and twenty-three donkeys, of which thirty-seven lack 14,900 catties of fodder. Fifteen households were preparing to sell their livestock. After implementing the above methods, the problem of fodder shortage was solved, and those who originally wanted to sell cattle are no longer selling them.

    In solving the problem of draught cattle feed, combining production for self-salvation and promoting the spirit of mutual assistance and mutual relief, and thinking of ways from multiple aspects is worth promoting. Each method can solve some problems. The more methods you think of, the more problems you solve, and the stronger the masses' confidence in overcoming difficulties. It is wrong to rely solely on the government and supply and marketing cooperatives to solve the problem through loans and fodder supply, without actively mobilizing the masses to think of more ways.

    Judging from the situation in many flood-stricken areas, some areas can only solve part or most of the draught cattle feeding problem by relying on the strength of the local area. To fully do this work well, it is necessary to have the support of non-disaster areas, especially nearby non-disaster areas. Some non-disaster areas are actively supporting the disaster areas, some accepting draught cattle fostered by farmers in the disaster areas, and some providing farmers with large quantities of fodder. The experience of some areas has proved that in organizing this work, in addition to promoting mutual assistance and mutual relief, the principle of mutual benefit should also be taken into account. Article in the fosterage contract of the 5th district of Echeng County, Hubei Province, stipulates the method of sharing according to shares (fostering until the green is connected this year, strong cattle are divided into four shares, the cattle owner retains three shares, and the fosterer is given one share; small cattle are more difficult to feed, divided into five shares, the cattle owner retains three shares, and the fosterer is given two shares), which is in line with the principle of mutual benefit. The work of supporting disaster areas with fodder and adjusting cattle from disaster areas to the outside should be mostly carried out through supply and marketing cooperatives. Supply and marketing cooperatives that bear this task, especially supply and marketing cooperatives in non-disaster areas, should make it clear that this is an extremely important task to support farmers in disaster areas to rebuild their homes and restore production, and should actively and responsibly do it well.

    Vigorously preventing and controlling animal epidemics is a very important task. The draught cattle in the flood-stricken areas are generally weak due to water immersion and imbalanced feeding and drinking. Therefore, it is necessary to actively prevent the occurrence of animal epidemics and treat the sick cattle in time. Some areas with centralized grazing or centralized feeding should pay more attention to this prevention and control work. At present, some areas have already experienced animal epidemics of varying degrees. Anthrax, emphysema, and hemorrhagic septicemia among these epidemics are very harmful to draught cattle. In the case of draught cattle weakened by the floods last year, these epidemics will naturally be more harmful to draught cattle. Prevention first is the guiding principle for the prevention and control of animal epidemics. Disaster areas should first vigorously carry out prevention work. Areas with conditions should carry it out as early as possible. According to the experience of the vast areas, in the work of preventing and controlling animal epidemics, we should unite the Chinese veterinary doctors well and give play to their role. Last year, draught cattle in the flood-stricken areas generally suffered from indigestion. The effect of treatment with traditional Chinese medicine is generally very good, which is worth promoting. Naturally, in the work of preventing animal epidemics, we should also do a good job in the cold protection equipment for draught cattle and improve feeding management to enhance the disease resistance of draught cattle and more actively prevent the invasion of animal epidemics.

    大力保护灾区耕牛过冬
    正宇
    去年遭受水灾的各省，在洪水到来前，遵照前中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会“关于抢救水灾地区牲畜的指示”，曾努力抢救耕牛。多数地区都完成了任务，抢救出大批的耕牛。这是去年生产救灾工作中一项很大的成绩。目前水灾地区的农民都已还乡生产，随着农民转移出去的耕牛也多数带回了灾区。如何继续保住这些耕牛，已成为水灾地区当前一个严重的问题。
    一些水灾地区在领导农民还乡生产中，大力进行了保护耕牛的工作，根据具体情况采用各种办法，解决了耕牛过冬问题。但是也有些灾区没有做好这一工作，耕牛饲草、棚舍问题始终没有很好解决，因此就不断发生耕牛死亡的现象。
    领导灾区农民进行生产自救要作的工作固然有许多，如：解决农民的口粮问题、帮助农民修建房舍、领导农民进行农、副业生产等。但是在进行上述工作的同时，不要忽视保护耕牛。因为冬季不做好护牛工作，将会给春耕生产带来很大困难。有的地区把护牛当成为农民“保存元气”，这是很有道理的。水灾地区的干部和农民都应有这样的认识，把今天的护牛工作，当成为今后农业生产保住元气的工作。
    去年遭受水灾的地区较大，有些并且是重灾区。在大片灾区和重灾区保护耕牛是有困难的，但从已经进行这一工作的地区的经验来看，这种困难是可以克服的。以各地比较普遍感到的缺乏饲草的问题来说，许多地区已想出一些有效的解决办法。有些地区，采用荞麦秆、豆稭、甘薯蔓、马铃薯稭、稻壳等代替稻草，有些地区组织农民大量收集野草、湖草、树叶等，解决饲草不足的问题。据湖北汉阳县计算，若单纯以谷壳、稻草为饲料，仅能供给全县约三分之二的耕牛。若是利用稻草以外的作物稭秆为代用饲草，再加上放牧，就可以解决全部耕牛饲草的问题。广泛地采用代用饲料是对的，但绝不要用有病虫害（有黑斑病的、象鼻虫为害过的、有乾腐病的等）的甘薯和霉坏的甘薯藤、花生藤喂牛。去年河南个别地区已发生因用坏甘薯喂牛而发生中毒的现象。有些地区采用有牛缺草户和有草缺牛户互相调剂，合伙饲养共同使用，借草还草或还钱等办法，也解决了很大问题。安徽宿县后寨选区有牛二十四条，驴二十三头，其中有三十七头缺草料一万四千九百斤，有十五户准备卖牲口，实行上述办法后，缺乏草料的问题解决了，原想卖牛的现在都不卖了。
    在解决耕牛饲料问题上，结合生产自救、发扬互助互济的精神，多方面想办法的作法是值得提倡的。每种办法总能解决一些问题，想的办法越多，解决的问题就越大，群众克服困难的信心就越强。单纯依靠政府、供销合作社通过贷款和供草来解决问题，不积极发动群众多想办法的作法是不对的。
    从许多水灾地区的情况看，有的地区在解决耕牛饲养问题上，靠本地区的力量只能解决一部或大部问题。要完全作好这件工作，还必须非灾区，特别是临近的非灾区的支援。有些非灾区对灾区的支援是积极的，有的接受灾区农民寄养的耕牛，有的供给农民大批的饲草。一些地区的经验证明，组织这一工作，除了提倡互助互济外还应该照顾到互利的原则。湖北省鄂城县五区在寄养合同中规定按股分成的办法（寄养到今年接青，壮牛按四股分成，牛主保留三股，代养者分给一股；小牛比较难喂，按五股分成，牛主保留三股，代养者分给二股），是符合互利原则的。支援灾区饲草，和由灾区向外调剂牛只的工作大部分要通过供销合作社进行，负有这种任务的供销合作社，特别是非灾区的供销合作社，应明确这是支援灾区农民重建家园、恢复生产的一项极重要的工作，应该积极地负责地把它做好。
    大力防治畜疫是一件很重要的工作。水灾地区的耕牛，由于水浸和饲饮失调，体质大都衰弱，因此必须积极防止畜疫的发生和及时医治已染病的耕牛。一些有集中放牧或集中饲养的地区，更应重视这种防治工作。目前有些地区已经发生轻重不同的畜疫，这些畜疫中的炭疽、气肿疽、出血性败血病等对耕牛为害都很大；在去年水灾地区耕牛体质衰弱的情况下，这些疫病对耕牛的危害自然更大。预防为主是防治畜疫的方针。水灾地区首先应大力开展预防工作。有条件的地区都应该及早进行。根据广大地区的经验，在防治畜疫工作中，应该很好地团结中兽医，发挥他们的作用。去年水灾地区的耕牛普遍发生消化不良病症，用中药治疗的效果一般很好，值得提倡。自然，在预防畜疫工作中，还应做好耕牛的防寒设备和改善饲养管理，以增强耕牛的抗病机能，更积极地防范畜疫的侵袭。
