Launch Winter Production to Strive for Greater Harvest

    The Bohai Agricultural Production Cooperative in Funing County, Hebei Province, achieved a general bumper harvest of crops last year. After calculating the accounts, all the cooperative members sold more than one million jin of surplus grain to the state. After all the surplus grain was delivered to the state warehouse by the end of November last year, the cooperative convened a members' meeting to discuss and decide to immediately switch to winter production and strive to sell two million jin of surplus grain to the state this year. The cooperative has more than 6,800 mu of farmland. It is planned to accumulate more than 20 million jin of fertilizer, with an average fertilization of 3,000 jin per mu. It is also planned to cover 117 mu of saline-alkali land and silted-up land with sand and black soil. As of December 8 last year, the cooperative had accumulated more than 8.8 million jin of various fertilizers and had pulled sand and soil onto 23 mu of saline-alkali land and silted-up land.

    开展冬季生产争取更大丰收
    河北省抚宁县渤海农业生产合作社，去年庄稼获得普遍丰收。全体社员经算账后，把一百多万斤余粮卖给了国家。到去年十一月底，全部余粮送到国家仓库后，社里便召集社员大会，讨论决定立即转入冬季生产，争取今年卖给国家二百万斤余粮。全社有大田六千八百多亩，计划积肥二千万多斤，每亩平均施肥三千斤，并计划把一百一十七亩水碱地和沙淤地铺上沙子和黑土。到去年十二月八日，全社已积了各种肥料八百八十万多斤，并把二十三亩水碱地和沙淤地拉上了沙土。　　（刘秉武）
