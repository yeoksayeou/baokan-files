    New Victories in Peaceful and Constructive Labor
    Peter Savarykin, Steel Rolling Worker of Kuznetsk Stalin Metallurgical Combine, Stalin Prize Winner
    The economic strength of our socialist motherland is growing stronger year by year, and the lives of the Soviet people are becoming more beautiful and happier.

    In 1954, inspired by the Communist Party and the Soviet government's historic resolutions on further developing heavy industry, expanding the production of daily necessities, and drastically improving agriculture, the Soviet people achieved new and significant victories.

    In the victorious completion of the national economic plan, the workers and staff of our Kuznetsk Stalin Metallurgical Combine also contributed their share of labor. The metallurgical workers of our combine have been victoriously completing the state plan month by month according to the entire metallurgical cycle.

    This year, in the blooming mill where I work as a steel rolling worker, many innovations and improvements have also been made. A new set of heating furnaces has been put into production. This allows each rolling mill to produce hundreds of tons more steel. Comprehensive automation of workshop operations has been implemented, and we have successfully mastered these automated devices. The mechanization and automation of the "1100" rolling mill alone has increased steel production by 15 percent, and the productivity of each hot rolling hour of the rolling mill has increased by 10 percent.

    The mechanization and automation of the workshop have greatly reduced the labor intensity of the workers. Now, we steel rolling workers are completely free from manual labor, managing the rolling mill from our spacious and bright control rooms, pressing buttons and pulling levers. Complex linkages obediently roll huge, red-hot steel ingots into the required steel shapes.

    Many significant things have happened in my life this year. On April 18th, I set a world record for rolling steel during each shift. The metallurgical workers of our factory gave me high honor, sending me to attend the Third Congress of the Trade Union of Ferrous Metallurgy, where I was elected as a member of the Central Committee of the Trade Union of Ferrous Metallurgy and a delegate to the Eleventh All-Union Congress of Trade Unions. Thus, I, an ordinary worker, sat in the presidium of this congress alongside the leaders of the Communist Party and the Soviet government. These great people had sincere and intimate conversations with me. I heard the speeches of foreign friends, including the greetings from the fraternal Chinese working class, and I thought of how strong the unity of the Party, the government, and the people is in our country, and how solid the friendship of the workers of the world is.

    A joyous event also occurred in my family. On May 3rd, my wife gave birth to a baby boy. We named him Sergei. The child is growing strong and lively. This is of course natural. In our Soviet country, all conditions have been created for the happiness of children. My wife and I live with our two boys in a comfortable two-room apartment with good facilities. A generous salary allows me not only to give my children nutritious food and good clothing, but also to decorate the house beautifully. The furniture in our house is comfortable, and we bought it according to our own preferences. My wife is a skilled embroiderer, and she has turned our house into a comfortable place where I can rest well after a day's work.

    Most metallurgical workers have such housing. The area of houses built for the workers of the combined factory this year alone is more than 9,000 square meters. Construction in our city is still underway. People move into new and beautiful residences every month.

    Dozens of kindergartens and nurseries have been built for the children of metallurgical workers. In the summer, 2,500 children of our factory's workers go to children's summer resorts and Young Pioneer summer camps to engage in activities that increase their health and energy, and go on excursions.

    In our country, working people receive the attention, care, and respect of those around them. This year alone, more than 1,500 metallurgical workers in our factory have been awarded medals and orders of the Soviet government for their long-term and outstanding work in production.

    We all receive generous salaries. At the end of each year, the state gives us bonuses for our year's labor achievements. This December alone, the workers of our combined factory received bonuses of nearly 33 million rubles. I myself received 4,400 rubles. This money is enough to buy a piano and purchase good quality coats and clothes for myself and my wife.

    The Party and the government are very concerned about the health of metallurgical workers. This year, more than 4,500 workers from our factory went to various natural sanatoriums, sanatoria, and rest homes to spend their vacations. In August, an evening sanatorium was set up for our factory's workers in a scenic location in a park along the riverbank. To treat those resting, a bathing department and physiotherapy department have been established here. Metallurgical workers who obtain permits can take a car directly from the factory to the sanatorium. Here they receive rest, treatment, and delicious meals.

    Good material conditions enable workers to study and improve their general and technical knowledge. The factory has evening universities affiliated with higher education institutions and schools for young workers. There are 689 workers, foremen, and staff members in our factory studying in technical schools and colleges while continuing to work, and nearly 3,000 people have improved their culture in schools for young workers.

    Our achievements this year are great. But it is not the habit of Soviet people to be content with existing achievements and rest on their laurels. We must move forward resolutely, consolidate the power of the socialist motherland, improve the material welfare of the people, develop science and culture, and build a communist society more rapidly.

    After calculating the factory's reserves and potential, all the metallurgical workers of our combined factory have decided to complete the Fifth Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule before the 38th anniversary of the Great October Revolution. And I will spare no effort to work selflessly in order to benefit the Soviet motherland. In 1955, we will produce more steel.

    I sincerely wish that in 1955, the friendship and unity between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China and the peoples of all the democratic camp countries will become even stronger, thereby further developing and consolidating the forces of peace around the world, and enabling the people's struggle for peace against the warmongers of imperialism to achieve full victory.

    在和平的建设性劳动中的新胜利
    苏联库兹湼茨斯大林冶金联合工厂初轧车间轧钢工人  斯大林奖金获得者  彼·萨瓦里金
    我们社会主义祖国的经济实力在逐年加强着，苏联人民的生活也变得更加美丽和幸福了。
    一九五四年，在共产党和苏联政府的关于进一步发展重工业、关于扩大日用品生产和急剧提高农业的历史性决议的鼓舞下，苏联人民取得了新的重大胜利。
    在胜利完成国民经济计划中，也有我们库兹湼茨斯大林冶金联合工厂的职工的一分劳动。我们联合工厂的冶金工作者逐月都在按照整个冶金周期，胜利完成国家计划。
    今年，在我担任轧钢工人的这个初轧车间里，也进行了很多革新和改进。一组新的加热炉已投入生产。这就使每部轧钢机能多生产数百吨的钢材。已经实行了车间工作的全面自动化，而且我们已胜利掌握了这些自动化装置。仅是“一一○○”轧钢机的机械化和自动化，就使钢材的生产率增加了百分之十五，而轧钢机每个热轧小时的生产率也提高了百分之十。
    车间的机械化和自动化大大减轻了工人的劳动。现在，我们轧钢工人已经完全摆脱了体力劳动，坐在自己宽敞明亮的操纵室里管理着轧钢机，按动电钮并扳动拉杆。复杂的联动机顺从地把巨大的烧红的钢锭压延成所需要的钢型。
    今年在我的生活中发生了很多有意义的事。四月十八日，我创造了每一值班时期压轧钢材的世界纪录。我厂的冶金工人给我以高度荣誉，派我出席黑色冶金业工会第三次代表大会，在那里我被选为黑色冶金业工会中央委员会的委员和出席第十一届全苏工会代表大会的代表。于是我一个普通的工人，就同共产党和苏联政府的领导者们一起，坐在这次代表大会的主席团中间。这些伟大的人们同我作了真挚、亲密的谈话。我听到外国朋友的发言，其中包括兄弟般的中国工人阶级的祝辞，于是我想到，在我国，党、政府和人民的团结是多么坚强，想到全世界工人的友谊是多么巩固。
    在我家里也出了一件喜事。五月三日我的妻子生了一个男孩子。我们替他起名为谢尔盖。小孩子长得很结实，很活泼。这也是当然的。在我们苏维埃国家里已经为儿童的幸福创造了一切条件。我同我的妻子和两个男孩子住在两间设备完善的舒适的屋子里。优厚的工资使我不但能给孩子们营养的食品和良好的服装，而且能把屋内布置得很漂亮。我们屋子里的家具很舒适，这是我们按照自己的爱好买的。我的妻子是一个刺绣的巧手，她使我们的屋子变成了一个舒适的地方，在这里，一天劳动之后，我可以得到很好的休息。
    大多数冶金人员都有这样的住屋。仅在今年内为联合工厂的劳动者盖的房屋的面积就在九千平方公尺以上。我们市内的建筑仍在进行。每月都有人搬进新的漂亮的住宅。
    已经为冶金人员的孩子们盖了几十个幼儿园和托儿所。在夏天，我厂职工的两千五百个孩子都到儿童避暑地、少先队夏令营去作增加健康和精力的活动，并作远足旅行。
    在我国，劳动的人受到周围人们的注意、关怀和尊敬。仅在今年内，我厂就有一千五百多冶金人员因长期地而成绩卓著地从事生产工作而获得苏联政府的勋章和奖章。
    我们全都得到优厚的工资。每年年终，国家都为我们一年的劳绩而给我们奖金。仅在今年十二月，我们联合工厂的劳动者就获得近三千三百万卢布这么多的奖金。我自己得到了四千四百卢布。这些钱完全足够用来购买钢琴、为我自己和我的妻子添置质料好的大衣和衣服。
    党和政府非常关怀冶金人员的健康。今年内前往各天然疗养地、疗养院、休养所度自己假期的我厂职工就在四千五百名以上。八月间在傍着河岸的公园中风景优美的地点，为我厂职工设置了一个晚间疗养院。为了给休息者进行治疗，这里设立了沐浴部和物理治疗科。得到许可证的冶金人员可以乘汽车从工厂直接到疗养院。他们在这里获得休息、治疗和丰美的餐食。
    良好的物质条件使工人们得以进行学习，并提高普通教育知识和技术知识。在工厂里附设有高等学校的夜大学和青年工人学校。我厂有六百八十九名不脱产的工人、工长和职员在技术专科学校和学院中学习，差不多有三千个人在青年工人学校中提高了自己的文化。
    今年我们的成就是伟大的。但是安于既得成就和高枕无忧，并不是苏维埃人的习惯。我们要坚毅地前进，巩固社会主义祖国的威力，改进人民的物质福利，发展科学和文化，更迅速地建成共产主义社会。
    我们联合工厂的全体冶金人员在计算了本厂的后备和潜力以后，决定提前在伟大十月革命节三十八周年以前完成第五个五年计划。而我也将不遗余力地忘我地劳动，以便为苏维埃祖国造福。一九五五年我们将生产更多的钢材。
    我衷心地预祝，在一九五五年，苏中两国人民之间和所有民主阵营国家的人民之间的友谊团结更趋巩固，从而使全世界保卫和平的力量更加发展和巩固，使人民争取和平反对帝国主义战争贩子的斗争获得充分的胜利。
