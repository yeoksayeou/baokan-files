    "The Icebreaker is Here!"
    On January 19th, at 3:30 PM, the icebreaking fleet on the Han River arrived at Yuekou Town in Tianmen County. The adults and children of Yuekou Town excitedly spread the word: "The icebreaker is here!"
    The people on the ships who had been trapped by ice for twenty days, the passengers eager to return home, and the residents of Yuekou Town were all eager to see how the icebreaking ships would demonstrate their power.
    As soon as the icebreaking fleet arrived at Yuekou Town, it immediately engaged in a fierce battle with the ice without stopping. Three sturdy icebreaking ships charged at high speed against the huge ice floes blocking their path. This ice floe had frozen the entire river bay, stretching for six or seven hundred meters. The icebreaking ships plunged into the ice with force, then turned sharply, cutting off large sections of ice from the sides of the ships. Soon, a ship carrying explosives followed, and the People's Liberation Army soldiers and navigation personnel responsible for the explosions immediately jumped onto the ice. They used pickaxes to dig holes in the ice, filled them with explosives, and after lighting the fuse, a deafening roar shook both banks of the river after half a minute. A large cloud of black smoke billowed from the ice floe, and the shattered ice fragments flew high into the air. After fifteen consecutive explosions on the ice in this way, and with the continuous impact of the icebreaking ships, the entire ice block in the river bay collapsed in less than two and a half hours. In the fading twilight, the river was filled with ice rapidly flowing downstream. In order to completely crush the ice, the icebreaking crew, in that critical situation, went full speed ahead and repeatedly crashed into the ice in the ice river. At this time, the national flag on the icebreaker fluttered in the wind, and the people on the ship and on the surrounding riverbanks cheered the victory.
    Once the waterway was opened, the stevedores on the docks immediately busied themselves transporting large packages of industrial raw materials and New Year's goods bound for Wuhan into the cargo holds. In front of the business station, people gathered to view the notice board announcing the sailing dates. The workers on the ships had already begun preparations for sailing. At this time, the icebreaking fleet, which had completed its mission, was preparing to continue along the Han River towards Fancheng.

    “破冰船来了！”
    新华社记者　徐奔
    一月十九日下午三点半钟，在汉水上破冰的船队到达了天门县岳口镇。岳口镇大人小孩兴奋地争相传告：“破冰船来了！”
    被冰围困了二十天的轮船上的人们、急待回家的旅客和岳口镇老百姓都急切地想看破冰轮船怎样施展威力。
    破冰的船队一开到岳口镇，没有停留就和冰展开了激烈的战斗。三艘坚固的破冰轮船以很高速度冲击着横在面前的巨大的冰块。这个冰块封冻了整个河湾，有六七百公尺长。只见破冰的轮船猛的插进冰里，又猛的一拐弯，大片大片的冰块就从船的侧面切开。不久，装着炸药的船也跟上来了，担任爆炸任务的解放军和航运人员立刻跳到冰上，用洋镐在冰上凿开了洞，把炸药填进冰里，在点燃了导火线以后，经过半分钟发出了震撼着两岸的巨响，冰块上冒着一大股黑烟，被炸碎了的冰块飞向高空。这样在冰上连续爆炸十五响之后，又经过冰船不断的猛撞，不到两个半钟头，河湾里整块的冰都垮了。在暮色苍茫中，满河的冰急速地向下流去。破冰的船员们为了把冰彻底粉碎，在当时那种危急情况，开足马力在冰河中反复撞击。这时，破冰船上国旗迎风飘扬，船上和四周河岸上的人们齐声欢呼战斗胜利结束。
    航道一开通，码头上的搬运工人立刻忙着把大包大包运往武汉的工业原料和年货送进货舱。在营业站的门前，人们围着观看开航日期的预告牌。轮船上的工人已开始开航的准备工作。这时候，执行破冰任务的船队，又准备继续沿着汉水向樊城前进了。
