    Sichuan Daily's Help to Special District Newspapers
    Wang Dishan
    Sichuan Daily started its newspaper review work in April 1954. Experience over the past few months has proven that publishing newspaper reviews in the provincial party committee's newspaper is an effective way for the provincial party committee to supervise and guide newspaper work, and it is also a concrete help from the provincial party committee's newspaper to the newspapers of lower-level party committees, especially the newspapers of special districts.
    Sichuan Province currently has eight special district-level newspapers, six of which are mainly aimed at farmers, one (New Zigong Daily) is aimed at salt well workers, and one (Minjiang Daily) is a newspaper in the Tibetan Autonomous Region. The total circulation of these eight newspapers reaches more than 80,000 copies per issue. In addition, there are thirty-six factory and mining newspapers (excluding Chongqing). These newspapers have gradually become powerful tools for local party committees and factory and mining party committees to connect with, educate, and organize the masses. However, due to the small number of cadres, lack of experience in running newspapers, and the general lack of experience of the affiliated party committees in leading newspapers, some problems exist in the work that cannot be solved. Many comrades reported that "no one is in charge of local newspaper business, and it is difficult to improve the quality of newspapers." Last April, the newspaper and periodical department of the Propaganda Department of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee sent people to the newspapers of various special districts to understand the situation. The heads of each newspaper raised this issue, requesting that the party committee pay more attention to their work and hoping that the provincial newspaper would strengthen its business guidance to them. Since then, under the instruction of the Provincial Party Committee, Sichuan Daily has gradually carried out newspaper review work. As of the end of December, it had published six newspaper work reviews and nineteen small reviews (newspaper tours), which were welcomed by the special district newspapers. When the editorial department of Sichuan Daily invited the responsible comrades of the eight special district-level newspapers to a forum in July, everyone said that the provincial newspaper raised the problems in the propaganda of the special district newspapers and exchanged the experience of the special district newspapers through newspaper reviews, which was very helpful to the staff of the special district newspapers. At the same time, it also promoted the party committees in various places to strengthen their leadership over their own newspapers.
    In order to make the newspaper reviews of the provincial newspaper provide practical help to the work of the special district newspapers, according to the experience of Sichuan Daily, it is necessary to focus on the propaganda center in different periods, and grasp the weak links and key issues in the propaganda of the special district newspapers to solve them. For example, some special district newspapers in Sichuan that are mainly aimed at farmers were very weak in publicizing the country's socialist industrialization in the past. Nanchong Daily did not publish a single report on national industrial construction for three months in 1953. In the study of the general line, although each newspaper checked the shortcomings of neglecting the publicity of socialist industrialization and made some improvements, the direction of propaganda was still unclear. Based on this situation, Sichuan Daily published a newspaper work review "Special District Newspapers Begin to Strengthen the Publicity of Socialist Industrialization to Farmers" on April 28 last year, summarizing the experience of some newspapers and clearly pointed out that strengthening the publicity of socialist industrialization by farmers' newspapers is not to report industry in lengthy or isolated ways, but to focus on publicizing the leading role of industry in agriculture, and publicizing the relationship between the country's socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture, so as to educate farmers with the idea of the worker-peasant alliance. This pointed out the direction of propaganda for the special district newspapers mainly aimed at farmers. Therefore, some comrades of the special district newspapers reflected that this problem was raised "on the point" and "solved the problem very well." For example, there are vast mountainous areas in Sichuan. However, reports on mountainous areas have always been a relatively poor aspect of the propaganda of various special district newspapers. After learning about this problem from the work summaries of various newspapers, Sichuan Daily also checked the reports in this regard since the spring plowing last year, and found that although the number had increased, most of them were "discussing production on production," simply reflecting some agricultural activities in mountainous areas, and did not carry out propaganda from the perspective of building socialist mountainous areas. Sichuan Daily published a newspaper work review "Pay Attention to the Propaganda of Socialist Transformation of Mountainous Agriculture" on June 8, emphasizing that newspapers should use the light of socialism to illuminate the road forward for the people in mountainous areas. This review also produced better results. For example, Chuan Nan Daily has since improved its reports on mountainous areas. A special column "New Look of Mountainous Areas" was opened to reflect the new life of the people in mountainous areas more. However, Sichuan Daily has also published generalized newspaper reviews that do not solve problems. For example, a review on the propaganda of the draft constitution, because it did not seriously study what problems existed in the propaganda of the special district newspapers in this regard in advance, nor did it understand what difficulties they had in their work, it just made a general summary based on the fragmentary materials on the newspaper surface, and generally mentioned several aspects that should be paid attention to in the propaganda, so it did not produce the due effect. As some comrades of the special district newspapers criticized: "It is written lukewarm and cannot solve the problem."
    Another important task of the newspaper reviews published in the provincial newspaper is to support and promote the active initiatives and successful experiences in the work of the special district newspapers. Sichuan Daily has successively introduced through the "Newspaper Tour" column: the "Worker-Peasant Speaking Platform" of Fuling Mass Daily, which often publishes friendship letters between workers and farmers, the "Employee Life" column of New Zigong Daily, which has a strong life atmosphere, the rich and colorful newspaper compiled by Tongchuan Daily, the special pages and sketches of Chuan Nan Daily, and so on. These short articles have attracted the attention of the special district newspapers after they were published. Not only are they a kind of support and encouragement to the newspapers that are introduced, but they also have great enlightenment to other newspapers. For example, Chuan Nan Daily also added a column "Worker-Peasant Chatting Place" after Fuling Mass Daily, and often publishes letters from workers and farmers encouraging and supporting each other.
    The article "Employee Life" of New Zigong Daily, although it says that workers' newspapers should reflect and guide the lives of employees in many aspects, in addition to reflecting their production activities, they should also reflect their learning, entertainment, family life, as well as the growth of new relationships between people such as teachers and apprentices, couples, etc., but it also helped the farmers' newspapers to better report on the lives of farmers in many aspects and reflect the new atmosphere in rural areas. Of course, Sichuan Daily also has shortcomings in this regard, that is, sometimes it cannot discover and spread the fresh things in the budding state on the special district newspapers in a timely manner, such as sometimes it is introduced after a long time, which weakens the guiding nature of the newspaper review.
    While commending the achievements of the special district newspapers and supporting their initiatives, the newspaper reviews of the provincial newspaper must also seriously criticize the mistakes and shortcomings of the special district newspapers and point out the ways to overcome them. On the issue of carrying out criticism, some comrades of Sichuan Daily once had a concern that the special district newspapers have few people and lack experience in running newspapers, so it is not appropriate to criticize the shortcomings in their work. Facts have proved that this view is not comprehensive. Because newspaper work, like other work, cannot move forward without criticism. Since the special district newspapers are connected to the broad masses of working people, and are an important tool for the local party committees to educate and organize the broad masses, they cannot be allowed to have serious shortcomings and mistakes. At the same time, the special district newspapers generally welcome and value the criticism of the provincial newspaper. For example, in the article "National Day Propaganda of Special District Newspapers," Sichuan Daily criticized New Zigong Daily for not systematically and fully publicizing the achievements of local production and construction and the improvement of people's lives, as well as the shortcomings such as errors in publishing important documents. The editorial board of New Zigong Daily made a special inspection and organized the staff to study in order to learn from the National Day reports and improve the future political propaganda. For example, Sichuan Daily pointed out in the newspaper work review "Continue to Deepen the Propaganda of the General Line Centered on Spring Plowing Production" that Nanchong Daily neglected to educate farmers with the idea of consolidating the alliance between poor peasants and middle peasants, and pointed out in the newspaper tour "Newspapers should seriously carry out labor education" that this newspaper did not report enough on the development of people's education in recent years and the enrollment of graduates from senior elementary schools and junior high schools. Since then, Nanchong Daily has overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings. Of course, every criticism of the special district newspapers by the provincial newspaper must be highly responsible and realistic. It must never make arbitrary conclusions based on a star and a half of materials, or deliberately pick on individual and occasional mistakes, which will not achieve good results.
    The reason why the newspaper review work of Sichuan Daily can be carried out initially is first of all because the party committee attaches importance to it. The Sichuan Provincial Party Committee instructed Sichuan Daily to strengthen its guidance and help to the special district newspapers. In addition to requiring the special district newspapers to regularly send cadres to Sichuan Daily for internships, it also required Sichuan Daily to carry out newspaper review work. The newspaper and periodical department of the Propaganda Department of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee regarded newspaper review as an important way to supervise and guide the special district newspapers. They exchanged information, materials, and opinions with the editorial department of Sichuan Daily; jointly determined the review plan for each period and divided the writing. This provided favorable conditions for carrying out newspaper review work. On the other hand, the development of this work is also inseparable from the improvement of the understanding of newspaper review by the editorial department of Sichuan Daily. At first, some comrades in the editorial department underestimated the role of newspaper review, thinking that "newspaper review is an unimportant column, it can be done or not," "newspaper review is only read by a few newspaper work cadres, the target is very narrow," and some people also thought that "their own newspaper has not been run well, how can they comment on other newspapers?" It was not until March last year that the Party Life Group officially took on this work, included it in the work agenda, and studied and discussed it according to the spirit of the decision of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1931 "On Village, District and Grassroots Newspapers" and Glebov's thesis "On Newspaper Review," and realized the role of newspaper review in improving local newspapers and improving the party's propaganda level, At the same time, it criticized the fear of difficulties and reluctance to move forward. Later, the Party Life Group gradually strengthened the reading and research of the special district newspapers and carried out newspaper review work (now taken over by the Theoretical Propaganda Group).
    In the past, the newspaper work reviews and newspaper tours published by Sichuan Daily mainly reviewed the special district newspapers, and the quality was not high enough. Now the editorial department of Sichuan Daily is preparing to expand the object of review to the larger number of factory and mining grassroots newspapers, and gradually improve the quality of newspaper review. In order to do this, in addition to further obtaining the leadership of the party committee and the help of the newspaper and periodical departments, and strengthening the connection with the special district newspapers and grassroots newspapers, it is also necessary for each group and local reporter in the editorial department to care about and assist in this work. Only in this way can the newspaper review work of Sichuan Daily be improved from the existing basis, so as to be more frequent, extensive, profound and effective.

    四川日报对专区报纸的帮助
    王地山
    四川日报是从一九五四年四月份起开展报纸述评工作的。几个月来的经验证明，在省委机关报上发表报纸述评，是省委对报纸工作实行监督和指导的一种有效方式，也是省委机关报对下级党委报纸首先是专区报纸的一种具体帮助。
    四川省现有八个专区级报纸，其中六个以农民为主要对象，一个（新自贡报）以盐井工人为对象，一个（岷江报）是藏族自治区的报纸。这八种报纸每期发行量达八万多份。另外还有三十六种厂矿报纸（不包括重庆市）。这些报纸已逐渐成为地方党委和厂矿党委联系、教育和组织群众的有力工具。但这些报纸由于干部少，办报经验不足，所属党委一般也缺乏领导报纸的经验，因而在工作中存在一些问题不能解决。不少同志反映“地方报纸业务没人管，报纸质量很难提高。”去年四月，中共四川省委宣传部报刊处派人到各专区报纸了解情况，各报负责人都提出了这个问题，要求党委多关心他们的工作，希望省报加强对他们的业务指导。此后，四川日报在省委的指示下，逐步开展了报纸述评工作。截至十二月底止已发表了六篇报纸工作述评和十九篇小型述评（报纸巡礼），受到专区报纸的欢迎。七月间四川日报编辑部邀请八个专区级报纸的负责同志开座谈会时，大家都说省报通过报纸述评来提出专区报纸宣传中的问题，交流专区报纸工作的经验，对专区报纸工作人员很有帮助，同时也推动各地党委加强了对自己机关报的领导。
    要使省报的报纸述评对专区报纸的工作有切实的帮助，根据四川日报的经验，必须围绕不同时期的宣传中心，抓住专区报纸宣传中的薄弱环节和关键问题来加以解决。例如，四川一些以农民为主要对象的专区报纸过去对国家社会主义工业化的宣传十分薄弱。南充报在一九五三年曾有三个月没有登过一篇关于国家工业建设的报道。在学习总路线中，各报对忽视社会主义工业化宣传的缺点虽进行了检查，并有所改进，但宣传的方向仍不明确。四川日报根据这种情况，在去年四月二十八日发表了报纸工作述评“专区报纸开始加强向农民宣传社会主义工业化”，总结了某些报纸的经验，明确地指出，农民报纸加强社会主义工业化的宣传并不是要连篇累牍地或孤立地报道工业，而是要着重宣传工业对农业的领导作用，宣传国家社会主义工业化同农业的社会主义改造的关系，以工农联盟的思想教育农民。这就给以农民为主要对象的专区报纸指出了宣传的方向。因此一些专区报纸的同志反映，这个问题正提到“点子”上，“很解决问题”。又如，在四川有广大的山区。但是关于山区的报道一直是各专区报纸宣传得较差的方面。四川日报从各报的工作总结中了解到这个问题后，又检查了去年春耕以来各报这方面的报道，发现数量虽增加了，但大都是
  “就生产论生产”，单纯反映一些山区农事活动，没有从建设社会主义的山区着眼来进行宣传。四川日报就在六月八日发表了报纸工作述评“重视对山区农业进行社会主义改造的宣传”，强调报纸要用社会主义的光芒照耀山区人民的前进道路。这篇述评也产生了较好的效果。像川南报此后就改进了山区的报道。并辟了“山区新面貌”的专栏，来更多地反映山区人民的新生活。但是四川日报也曾经发表过一般化的、不解决问题的报纸述评。例如有一篇论及宪法草案宣传的述评，由于事先没有认真研究专区报纸这方面的宣传究竟存在什么问题，也不了解他们工作中究竟有哪些困难，只是根据报面上的片断材料作了一番笼统的综述，泛泛地提到了宣传中应注意的几个方面，就没有产生应有的效果。正如有些专区报纸的同志所批评的：“写得不痛不痒，不能解决问题。”
    发表在省报上的报纸述评的另一个重要任务，是支持和推广专区报纸工作中的积极倡议和成功经验。四川日报曾通过“报纸巡礼”栏先后介绍了：涪陵群众报经常发表工人同农民友谊通信的“工农讲话台”，新自贡报有浓厚生活气息的“职工生活”栏，通川报一期编得丰富多采的报纸，川南报的专页和小品文，等等。这些短文发表后都引起了专区报纸的注意，不仅对被介绍的报纸是一种支持和鼓舞，对其他的报纸也有很大的启发作用。如川南报继涪陵群众报之后也增辟了“工农交谈处”一栏，经常发表工人同农民相互鼓励相互支援的通信。
  “新自贡报的‘职工生活’”一文，虽然说的是工人报纸应当多方面地反映和指导职工的生活，除反映职工的生产活动外，还应反映他们的学习、文娱、家庭生活以及师徒、夫妇等人与人间新的关系的成长，但也同样帮助了农民报纸更好地多方面地报道农民的生活，反映农村的新气象。自然，四川日报在这一方面也有缺点，那就是有时还不能及时地发现和传播专区报纸上萌芽状态的新鲜事物，如有时当事情过了很久以后才加以介绍，这就削弱了报纸述评的指导性。
    在表扬专区报纸的成绩和支持它们的倡议的同时，省报的报纸述评还必须严肃地批评专区报纸的错误和缺点，并指出克服的途径。在开展批评的问题上，四川日报某些同志曾经有过一种顾虑，认为专区报纸人手少，办报经验差，对他们工作中的缺点不宜批评。事实证明，这种看法是不全面的。因为报纸工作也同其他各项工作一样，没有批评就不能前进。专区报纸既然联系着广大的劳动群众，既然是地方党委用来教育和组织广大群众的重要工具，就不能容许它们有严重的缺点和错误。同时，专区报纸对省报的批评一般也是欢迎和重视的。如四川日报在“专区报纸的国庆宣传”一文中，曾批评了新自贡报没有系统地充分地宣传当地生产建设的成就和人民生活的提高，以及发表重要文件出现差错等缺点，新自贡报编委会就专门作了检查，并组织工作人员进行学习，以便从国庆报道中吸取教训，改进今后的政治宣传。又如四川日报曾在报纸工作述评“以春耕生产为中心继续深入地宣传总路线”中指出，南充报忽视以贫农同中农巩固联盟的思想教育农民，又在报纸巡礼“报纸应认真进行劳动教育”中指出，这个报纸对人民教育事业几年来的发展和高小、初中毕业生升学的情形报道得不够，此后南充报就克服了上述的缺点。自然，省报对专区报纸的每一个批评都必须是高度负责和实事求是的，绝不能抓住一星半点材料就妄加论断，或专门挑剔个别的、偶然的错误，那是不会收到好的效果的。
    四川日报的报纸述评工作所以能得到初步的开展，首先是因为党委的重视。四川省委曾指示四川日报加强对专区报纸的指导和帮助，除要求专区报纸定期派干部到四川日报实习外，并要求四川日报开展报纸述评工作。四川省委宣传部报刊处则把报纸述评当作监督和指导专区报纸的重要方式，他们同四川日报编辑部相互交换情况、交换材料、交换意见；共同确定每一时期的述评计划，并分工撰写。这就为开展报纸述评工作提供了有利的条件。在另一方面，这个工作能够开展起来，又是同四川日报编辑部对报纸述评认识的提高分不开的。起初，编辑部有些同志曾经低估报纸述评的作用，认为“报纸述评是无关紧要的栏目，可办可不办”，“报纸述评只有少数报纸工作干部看，对象很窄”，有人还认为“自己的报纸还没有办好，怎好评论别的报纸？”直到去年三月，党的生活组才正式担负起这个工作，把它列入工作日程，根据联共（布）中央一九三一年“关于村、区及基层报纸”等决议以及葛烈勃湼夫的论文“论报刊述评”的精神进行了学习和讨论，认识到报纸述评对改进地方报纸、提高党的宣传水平的作用，同时批判了畏难不前的情绪。以后党的生活组就逐渐加强了对专区报纸的阅读和研究，开展了报纸述评工作（现在改由理论宣传组接办）。
    过去，四川日报发表的报纸工作述评和报纸巡礼主要是评述专区报纸，而且质量还不够高。现在四川日报编辑部正准备把评述的对象扩大到数量更多的工矿基层报纸，并逐步提高报纸述评的质量。为要做到这一点，除必须进一步取得党委的领导和报刊部门的帮助，加强同专区报纸和基层报纸的联系外，还需要编辑部各组和地方记者都来关心和协助这个工作。只有这样，四川日报的报纸述评工作才可能从现有的基础上提高一步，做到更加经常、广泛和深刻、有效。
