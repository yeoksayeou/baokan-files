    “Journey to the West” Notes
    Zhang Tianyi
    Editor's Note: This article originally appeared in "People's Literature," February 1954 issue. The author here factually analyzes the formation and development of the "Journey to the West" story, reasonably explains the realistic content and social significance of "Journey to the West," and criticizes the misinterpretation of this work, so that readers can recognize the true face of Journey to the West. This is the point of view, method, and attitude that should be taken in the study of classical literary works, and can be used as a reference for everyone.
    About Subject Matter, Theme, and Author's Attitude
    I
      Before "Journey to the West" (Yang Zhihe's 41-chapter version and Wu Cheng'en's 100-chapter version), the works we can now see are "The Poetry of Tripitaka of the Great Tang Dynasty's Journey for Scriptures" (Commercial Press "Punctuated Vernacular Stories of the Song Dynasty" version, incomplete), and Wu Changling's zaju drama "Tang Sanzang's Journey to the West for Scriptures" (Shanghai Magazine Company "Complete Collection of Yuan Dynasty Zaju Dramas" Fourth Series), all of which are about the story of the journey for scriptures.
      "The story of the Journey for Scriptures, from the late Tang to the Song and Yuan dynasties, gradually evolved into the mythical, and was able to be coherent, so novelists could also take it as a biography." (Lu Xun: "A Brief History of Chinese Fiction" p. 164)
    So the story of "Journey to the West" has been circulating in the folk for about six hundred years (from the late Tang Dynasty to the Ming Dynasty's Yang Zhihe and Wu Cheng'en), and has been created, selected, added, deleted, modified, and processed by many people before it developed into this appearance.
    II
    We know that Xuanzang was a historical figure. He went to India to seek scriptures, but in fact it was not by imperial decree, but rather "formed a group and submitted a memorial, which was not allowed by edict." Others retreated, but he was not discouraged, made all the preparations, and secretly left the country alone. He experienced many hardships, traveled more than fifty countries, for seventeen years, and brought back more than six hundred Buddhist scriptures. Then he organized a translation center and engaged in translation until his death.
    One of his students (Huili) wrote a biography called "The Biography of the Dharma Master of the Great Tang Ci'en Temple" [1] (ten volumes, with a China Inner Academy printed edition). After reading this biography, we know that Xuanzang was a man of great perseverance, unwilling to bow his head to difficulties, and also a great translator. Such a person.
    If we were to write about this subject matter, I think, probably everyone would focus on this aspect. We must properly show his willpower of "sincerity valuing effort," his work ethic, etc., right?
    But the scripture-seeking story that was circulating at that time - did not handle it this way. Those authors intentionally or unintentionally infiltrated some miracles into this story, more and more, causing this historical story to change its nature and become a story of gods and demons. And Xuanzang, the character, gradually became a god, not the original mortal.
    As for those qualities and characteristics of Xuanzang that we pay attention to, they are only the qualities and characteristics of a mortal - what is the necessity of this for a Tang Monk (Xuanzang) who is protected by all the Buddhas and gods? Therefore, they gradually faded in this story, until they disappeared, and were replaced by other things: all the hardships were transformed into demons, and the power to overcome difficulties was the power of the gods.
    Thus, Xuanzang's struggle against difficulties became the contradiction and struggle between gods and demons.
    III
    How are these types of stories written?
    Of course, gods and demons do not exist in reality, they are imagined by the author. But imagination must first have raw materials - he must take what he sees, hears, and feels in reality as raw materials. Then, based on his own likes and dislikes, views, hopes, etc., he selects some that he likes and are useful to him from this pile of raw materials, reorganizes, processes, and creates imagined or fantastic things.
    People always envision heaven and hell according to their own lifestyles, ideas, etc.
    So these stories of gods and demons - whether the author himself is aware of it or not - will always more or less, obviously or hiddenly, deeply or shallowly, correctly or distortedly, reflect certain aspects of social life in a certain era: and this, of course, is reflected through the thoughts and feelings of a certain class or stratum of people at that time, so these stories also express the emotions and attitudes (what to love, what to hate) and critical attitudes (what to affirm, what to negate) of a certain class or stratum, or express their ideals (such as a good heaven).
    What is written in this scripture-seeking story: on one side are the gods, the gods are the rulers high above, from the celestial realm to the underworld, all must bow their heads and obey. On the other side are the demons - who insist on struggling out from under the ruling forces pressing down on them, standing upright, even rebelling. The heavenly soldiers and generals want to subdue them, the demon heads want to resist, and they fight fiercely.
    This makes us think of the contradictions and struggles between the ruling class and the people - mainly the peasants - in feudal society.
    Did those authors intentionally and clearly use the heavenly Buddhas and gods to depict landlords, nobles, and emperors, and use the rebellion of the monsters to depict peasant uprisings? That is hard to say. We only say that the main class relations and contradictions of feudal society at that time (before the Opium War) are reflected here to some extent: and the more this story evolves, the more it develops, the more obvious this is reflected. By the time of "Journey to the West," we even have to guess whether the author was somewhat consciously trying to express this point.
    IV
    According to what we can see now (Huili's biography, fragments of legends scattered in "Taiping Guangji," as well as "The Poetry of Tripitaka of the Great Tang Dynasty's Journey for Scriptures," the zaju drama "Tang Sanzang's Journey to the West for Scriptures," to the 41-chapter and 100-chapter versions of "Journey to the West"), then the "gradual evolution into the mythical" of this scripture-seeking story since the late Tang Dynasty, I think, maybe can be narrated like this -
    At first, it was just a slight deification of Xuanzang (even Huili's biography has this tendency). This may have been spread by some Buddhist believers: religious believers in ancient times were often unwilling to describe their ancestors as ordinary people. And where there are gods, there must be demons. Later, as this story of gods and demons developed, it reflected the contradictions and struggles between the ruling class and the people in the contradictions and struggles between gods and demons, so some characters who defended the "orthodoxy" of the feudal ruling class unintentionally modified and processed it, which gradually became a story of punishing evil and promoting good - the so-called "good" and "evil" here are, of course, the "good" and "evil" of the feudal ruling class.
    You see, victory is always on the side of the ruling class gods. Even a powerful demon head like Sun Wukong finally surrendered to the gods - called "returning to the right path." He protected Tang Sanzang to the Western Heaven to seek scriptures, and fought evilly with his past kind and even companions along the way, made contributions, and as a result, he himself became a god - called becoming a "positive result."
    God is right, the devil is evil, and evil cannot defeat righteousness: this constitutes the theme of this scripture-seeking story (this is already very obvious in "The Poetry of Tripitaka of the Great Tang Dynasty's Journey for Scriptures" and the "Journey for Scriptures" zaju drama).
    However, this story also shares the fate of many other stories of gods and demons, since it circulated among the folk - that is, among the peasants and city people (handicraft workers, small merchants, and even soldiers, yamen runners, down-and-out scholars, vagrants, etc.), it gradually became not so simple, not so pure. Because when this story was circulating, these ordinary people also unintentionally described, selected, added, deleted, modified, and processed it according to their own ideas. The ordinary people themselves also participated in the creation of this story.
    The theme has not changed: the struggle between good and evil, and evil cannot defeat righteousness. But as for what the orthodox side is exactly "right" about, and what the evil side is exactly "evil" about, which side of people are hateful, which side of people are lovable - the ordinary people have their own views, their own attitudes. They describe the characters, life, activities, etc. of the two sides according to their own likes and dislikes, views. Some stories of gods and demons circulating among the folk often gradually change their appearance in this way, and the demons in them become more and more lovable - some even become positive heroic figures.
    The scripture-seeking story is like this. Developing to "Journey to the West" - not only is it simply two kinds of works compared to "The Poetry of Tripitaka of the Great Tang Dynasty's Journey for Scriptures" (which seems to imitate Buddhist scripture stories), even compared to the "Journey for Scriptures" zaju drama, the spiritual outlook is also very different.
    If the "Journey for Scriptures" zaju drama is still a biography of Tang Sanzang, then the real protagonist in "Journey to the West" has become Sun Wukong. If the Buddhas and gods in the "Journey for Scriptures" zaju drama are all described as so solemn and wonderful, and the demon heads are mostly some roles who make blind noise; then the Buddhas and gods in "Journey to the West" are all described as so ridiculous and hateful (being domineering and abusing power, and also being昏庸, bullying the weak and fearing the strong), while there are quite a few lovable roles among the demon heads.
    There will certainly not be any reader who, due to the influence of "Journey to the West," sincerely pays homage to the Jade Emperor or the Tathagata Buddha or the Taishang Laojun. In our readers' hearts, we are toward Sun Wukong who made a great disturbance in the Heavenly Palace, sympathize with Pigsy who is recruiting relatives to be a farmer in Gao Village, and regret the failure of the Bull Demon King and Princess Iron Fan who lost their beloved son, etc. In the world written in "Journey to the West," the so-called distinction between "right" and "evil" is not based on what is reasonable or unreasonable, just or unjust, but on violence.
    Thus, in this respect, "Journey to the West" has become such a work: in the original story theme and subject matter of defending the feudal orthodoxy, it more or less expresses the people's anti-orthodoxy emotions. The same theme and subject matter can also write works with different meanings and different functions, sometimes even opposite ones.
    "Journey to the West" is such a contradictory work.
    V
    Question: If this story was created by folk authors, then those folk authors could have solved this contradiction well, for example, to have a reversal: Sun Wukong's great disturbance in the Heavenly Palace - not letting him fail, but letting him win, how about it?
    However, how would Sun Wukong win? And what would happen after victory? - This is a question that the authors had to clarify first.
    If we criticize those folk authors who participated in the creation of "Journey to the West" for saying that they should have let Sun Wukong clearly know the goals of the peasant revolution and what class to rely on, that would be ridiculous. We know that the history at that time had not yet developed to the point where they could create such a character. The peasant uprisings at that time (before the Opium War) were often only spontaneous actions, and the uprising peasants often could not put forward a clear demand, let alone consciously realize that they were the true creators of history.
    Therefore, the authors of "Journey to the West" would only let Sun Wukong make a disturbance in the Heavenly Palace. And what kind of situation to make out of it, even Sun Wukong himself was initially vague. It was not until the Tathagata Buddha asked him that he suddenly thought of the Jade Emperor's throne (Chapter 7) - "Just tell him to move out and give the Heavenly Palace to me, and that's it."
    This makes it easy to understand the second question (what will happen after victory): if Sun Wukong succeeded, it would only be that the Jade Emperor's surname changed to Sun, just like Liu Bang and Zhu Yuanzhang climbed to the dragon throne by taking advantage of the high tide of the peasant uprising movement - they themselves became landlord leaders and rulers, and the peasants were still exploited and oppressed by the masters who changed their surnames, and eventually made a revolt again.
    What the authors at that time could see from history was only this. As for what progressive role each peasant uprising war would play in history, they could not yet see it.
    So, even if these authors made a reversal and wrote that Sun Wukong's disturbance in the Heavenly Palace was victorious and successful, it would only be to seize the "orthodoxy" from the Jade Emperor who lost the throne and offer it to the Jade Emperor who newly ascended the throne: that would still become a story theme of defending the feudal orthodoxy. So, it is still impossible to solve the contradiction of this work.
    Now that Sun Wukong's rebellion failed, the authors only saw these two paths in front of Sun Wukong: either like the Chimei, Yellow Turban, Huang Chao, and Fang La, they were bloodily suppressed by the landlord ruling class; or like Song Jiang and others written in "Water Margin" (100-chapter version or 120-chapter version, etc.), they were "recruited and appeased" by the landlord ruling class.
    "Journey to the West" wrote that Sun Wukong took the latter path.
    Of course, as for what happened after surrendering, there are differences. For example, "Water Margin" writes that Song Jiang and others conquered Liao, did a lot of work for the "imperial court," and after making contributions, a differentiation arose among the 108 brothers, and Song Jiang and Wu Yong, who held official positions, were finally harmed by the ruling class. And "Journey to the West" - writes that Sun Wukong and his two brothers finally became "positive results," but in the process of becoming "positive results," they revealed some contradictions, drew down the faces of those rulers of the Buddhas and gods, and ridiculed them.
    Not only that. Even if these authors exposed and ridiculed the feudal rulers, we still cannot think that they were explicitly opposing feudalism or opposing the feudal class. They could not yet have such an understanding. Even their heads were inevitably箍上 with more or less the "tight hoop" of the ruling ideology at that time, and they had to admit the "orthodoxy" of the feudal ruling class (they did not know what other orthodoxy there was). It was only when they came into contact with reality, when they came into contact with concrete characters and life, that they spontaneously revealed disgust and contempt for the rulers, and felt some closeness and belonging on the side of the oppressed邪统.
    So, not only could the author not solve the contradiction in the theme problem of "Journey to the West," but we also found that: the author's standpoint in some places in this work is vague or chaotic: sometimes the characters in the oppressed class are also糟蹋ed by the author, and the characters in the ruling class are also praised by the author - for example, Guanyin Bodhisattva (although there may be other reasons for this [2]).
    VI
    What is discussed above is only based on a hypothesis (assuming that all the stories in "Journey to the West" were created by the folk). In fact, we know that the creation of this story went through the hands of all kinds of people (of different classes). And the last person to write it into the currently popular 100-chapter version of "Journey to the West" was Wu Cheng'en (approximately 1510 [or 1500] - 1580, the remaining works also include the poetry collection "Surviving Manuscripts of Mr. Sheyang" [3], with a printed edition of the Palace Museum) - he was a literati, the so-called scholar-official stream (see "A Brief History of Chinese Fiction" p. 168, "Old News of Fiction" pp. 56-63).
    Although before him, there were already many plots about the scripture-seeking story (oral, or written, or performed), and Yang Zhihe's version went through another selection and organization, and became a complete long-length structure, but "Although Yang Zhihe's version is largely established, the writing is rough and only able to form a book; Wu is versatile, intelligent and elegant, and his selection of materials is quite extensive, ... satire and ridicule take the current state of the world, add exaggeration and description, almost changing the appearance" ("A Brief History of Chinese Fiction" p. 169). So the 100-chapter version is not simply made by selecting and writing materials, but is really the genius creation of this poet. Before this, I have not seen any family write fantastic stories of gods and demons that can be written so vividly, so beautifully and colorfully, and so kindly, so attractive to us.
    "Also, the author's temperament is 'good at comedy,' so although he describes the illusionary and erratic events, he also mixes humorous words, making gods and demons have human emotions, and goblins also understand worldly affairs, and an attitude of disrespect for the world is implied." ("A Brief History of Chinese Fiction" p. 173)
    Here, the rulers of the celestial realm - the Jade Emperor, Taibai Jinxing, Tota Heavenly King, and even Taishang Laojun, the Tathagata Buddha, etc., have all become the objects of the author's "satire and ridicule."
    But of course, it cannot be said that the author is standing on the side of the oppressed rebels, let alone that he is explicitly opposing feudalism or opposing the feudal class. These individual insightful and righteous elements in the scholar-official class may still be loyal to feudalism; their criticism of the rulers may be just like Jiao Da scolding the Jia family. They may just hope that these feudal rulers can be better, more promising, and more intelligent. - Even so, but as long as their criticism is truly pertinent and sharp, as long as they truly expose the true face of the ruling class, and truly hit the ruling class's sore spot, - then, such works are in line with the requirements of the people in this regard, and can resonate with the people's emotions.
    Such an author, if he dares to criticize, dares to face reality squarely, dares to tell the truth, and is willing to be close to and respect folk works, then he can select those things belonging to the people from the materials left by his predecessors, and select those things created by the people based on their own love and hate - because this is precisely the powerful critical weapon that is suitable for him (and since the author himself is a scholar-official stream, he is more familiar and understands those characters in the ruling class than the peasants and city people, then as long as he goes deep into reality, is loyal to reality, and has the ability to express it in a form that the ordinary people like to hear and see, it is also possible to further improve on the basis of the original folk works, and write more deeply and sharply).
    It is on this point that the author of "Journey to the West" and the people - even if the starting points are different from each other, even if the direction of moving forward beyond this point is also different from each other, but at present on this point - they coincide without prior consultation, and are unconsciously linked together. The ordinary people feel that this is a work that belongs to them.
    About Reality and Fantasy, Allegory, etc.
      The gods and demons in "Journey to the West" - Sun Wukong, Pigsy, Tota Heavenly King, Taibai Jinxing, etc. - are all fantastic roles that do not exist in reality, and are even very absurd. But this is only the appearance. As for the essence of these roles, their personalities, thoughts, feelings, activities, etc., they are indeed those few "people" commonly seen in real life. Fantastic form, realistic content. And the reality mentioned here has a more explicit, more positive, and more direct realistic significance than those realities mentioned earlier (the general stories of gods and demons naturally "will always more or less, obviously or hiddenly, deeply or shallowly, correctly or distortedly, reflect certain aspects of social life in a certain era"). What is written in "Journey to the West" is actually some social phases of that time, but it adopts the original mythological materials and expresses them through the mythological form.
    ×　×　×
    About the image of the demon heads. Sun Wukong is a monkey, Pigsy is a pig. We know that the images of monkeys and pigs used to express these two "people" are not randomly put together; if Sun Wukong were made into a dull pig body, and Pigsy were written as a lively monkey, it would not be suitable. Why is it suitable to use the monkey image to express the character of Sun Wukong? This is because this character and the monkey have some degree of similarity in certain points, which easily makes people associate. Otherwise, the character personality and image will not be unified.
    But pay attention, these similarities - only on certain points, to a certain extent. Once this certain limit is exceeded, it becomes a problem. After all, people are people, and monkeys are monkeys. Exceeding a certain limit, the human content and the monkey image will not match.
    If it comes to such a juncture - if you want to take into account writing "people," you will not write like a monkey; if you want to take into account writing like a monkey, you will not be able to write as a "person" - what should the author do?
    If what the author wants to write is literary creation, not a scientific report on animal morphology, then he should take into account writing "people." Here, the issue of reality and authenticity lies in the content of "people," not in the image of monkeys or pigs.
    The "people" we are talking about here, of course, does not refer to some general abstract "people," but refers to realistic and specific people - they live in a certain historical period, have their class nature and stratum nature, and this class nature and stratum nature are expressed through their specific personalities.
    ×　×　×
    There is also the issue of so-called subtle words and profound meaning.
    Of course, it is ridiculous to treat "Journey to the West" as a profound book of Zen and Taoism like the so-called "Wu Yizi" and "Wu Yuanzi." But let us tentatively admit that "Journey to the West" has some allegory, "taking the ape as the spirit of the heart, and the pig as the runaway of the mind," etc., and the Tripitaka says, "When the heart arises, all kinds of demons arise; when the heart ceases, all kinds of demons cease," etc. ("A Brief History of Chinese Fiction" p. 174). Assuming so, then "Journey to the West" is a "borrowing outside to speak of" "fable," meaning this (heart intention) and entrusting it to that (ape pig). Why can the meaning be here and entrusted to there? Because the author sees that there are some similarities in certain aspects to a certain extent between this there (ape pig) and this here (heart intention) - otherwise the fable will be incomprehensible.
    Even if we assume this, we must also pay attention that these similarities - only in certain aspects, in a certain sense, to a certain extent. Once this certain limit is exceeded, the contradiction is exposed. This type of fable is originally two-sided in itself: one side is the metaphor or symbol, and the other side is the metaphorized or symbolized, and the two each belong to different categories. Exceeding a certain limit, there will be contradictions and conflicts between the two.
    If it comes to such a juncture - if you want to take into account explaining the great principle of "the three realms are only mind," it is impossible to write Sun Wukong and Pigsy as realistic and specific characters; if you want to take into account writing these characters as realistic and specific, you will put aside the great principle of "the three realms are only mind" - what should the author do?
    This kind of allegorical form has such great limitations that it is simply impossible to use it to write a large realistic epic. If what the author writes is a realistic epic, not philosophical writing on ontology and epistemology (it is enough to drag Sun Wukong and Pigsy to make a metaphor, no need to spend much ink to describe their own lives), then he has to put down his set of "great principles" and take care of the two characters of Sun Wukong and Pigsy. That is to say, if you want to write the two characters of Sun Wukong and Pigsy as realistic and specific, you must never attach them to the metaphorized or symbolized thing (heart intention), but should let these two characters exist independently, let them have their own lives like living people, have their own personalities, thoughts, feelings, activities, etc., and have their own development.
      "Journey to the West" is doing just that. Regardless of the author's original intention - whether it is aimed at "clarifying the mind and seeing the nature," but according to what he shows, it is vivid characters, it is life. In this way, there is reality.
    It's just that some words such as "heart ape," "original nature," and "two hearts" are used in the chapter titles. Some chapter titles - such as "The Heretic Bewilders the True Nature, the Yuanshen Helps the Original Heart" (Chapter 33), "The Demons Deceive the Original Nature, the One Body Worships the True Suchness" (Chapter 77), etc. - I suspect that they were窜改ed by the various colors (or Buddhist, or Taoist, or Neo-Confucianist) of the "Wu Yizi" and "Wu Yuanzi" stream, wanting to use the chapter titles to point out the "great principles," but in fact it is not relevant to the content (just looking at the chapter titles, you will never remember what the content is).
    Looking at the author's writing of "demons" - each one has a origin and a ending, and the reasons why they are demons are also explained. Then these "various demons" are not born from Tang Sanzang's "heart," nor can they be controlled by Tang Sanzang's "heart." Even if Sanzang's heart can really be still, there will still be "demons" making trouble. These "demons" are clearly objective existences, the opposite of the ruling class. In this way, this work has such reality - this reality precisely negates the saying that "when the heart arises, all kinds of demons arise."
    ×　×　×
    There is also this kind of beginning in "Journey to the West":
    "When a person's heart generates a thought, heaven and earth all know it. If good and evil have no reward, heaven and earth must be selfish." - Appearing twice: Chapter 8, Chapter 87.
    If the author abstractly and conceptually processes this "heaven and earth" - although they are personified by the author, they are not realistic and specific people, but only impartial highest arbitrators beyond all worldly interests - then, maybe it is possible to make the readers believe these four sentences, and obediently obey the heavens, carefully and reverently皈敬 the "right path," and not dare to generate any thoughts of "offending" and making trouble.
    But the author of "Journey to the West" does not process it this way. He writes the representatives of this "heaven and earth" into living "people" with flesh and blood: these heavenly gods are not impartial arbitrators beyond all worldly interests, but a group that personally participates in this struggle of interests - and this group cannot be regarded as representatives of "good."
    The reason why Sun Wukong was defeated by the Jade Emperor and the others, is it because Sun Wukong did something "evil" and got his retribution? We say, not at all. The Sun Wukong under the author's pen is a realistic and concrete "person" (not an abstract and conceptual incarnation of a demon), making us understand his personality, thoughts, feelings, desires, and activities: we not only do not feel that he is "evil," but also feel that he is lovable, sympathize with him, and have our hearts toward him. His failure is not that "evil" cannot defeat "good," but only because of various reasons, his strength is not enough.
    Then, those four sentences written in this place - regardless of the author's subjective intention, but judging from the characters and their lives expressed in this work - the words "good," "evil," and "selfless" should be in quotation marks, because they precisely become a kind of satire.
    ×　×　×
    Then, it is very clear: it is precisely because "Journey to the West" writes about the characters, writes about their personalities, thoughts, feelings, desires, and activities, writes about how the gods are "right," how the demon heads are "evil," and what contradictions Sun Wukong and the others have after they "abandon evil and return to the right" (in terms of thoughts and actions), etc. - in this way, it can be expressed which side of the people are lovable, which side of the people are hateful, and it can be expressed the people's anti-orthodoxy emotions.
    If the author does not come into contact with specific characters and life, does not come into contact with reality, but only conceptually processes this theme - god is right, the devil is evil, and evil cannot defeat righteousness - this work will become the landlord ruling class's clichés of punishing evil and promoting good.
    If it is said that "Journey to the West" expresses some people's nature in this regard, then this people's nature is expressed through reality. Here, conceptualization and people's nature are incompatible.
    Appendix:
    [1] In the ancient Chinese biographical literature, I have not seen such a complete and large-scale work as "The Biography of the Dharma Master of the Great Tang Ci'en Temple." Although there are many places in it that are Buddhist embellishments and fantasies (some places are the evolution of miracles due to a lack of understanding of certain natural phenomena, and some places are the deification of this Xuanzang Master), it is generally a true chronicle. It can be seen who Xuanzang is, his learning spirit, and his work spirit, etc. Regarding how he overcame difficulties during the journey - especially the section from leaving the country to the Kingdom of Gaochang, it is written very movingly. From the literary style, it can also be seen how the author of the early Tang Dynasty was hesitating between parallel and prose.
      [2] Guanyin is probably the most popular Bodhisattva among the folk. When I was a child, I saw some Buddhist rural women in Zhejiang, although they were chanting "Namo Amitabha," the one they were interested in was still Guanyin Bodhisattva, and once they started talking, they couldn't finish, as if they were talking about their own sisters, so intimately. Guanyin's being loved has always been long-standing. Huili's biography of Xuanzang (Volume 1) mentions that Xuanzang recited the name of Guanyin Bodhisattva in times of great difficulty, and after learning the "Heart Sutra," he felt that reciting the "Heart Sutra" was more powerful, and the "Guanzizai Bodhisattva" in the "Heart Sutra" is actually another translation of "Guanyin."
    What kind of person is Guanyin, and why is she so popular?
    The "Lotus Sutra" describes several ideal figures in Mahayana Buddhism, and Guanyin Bodhisattva is one of them. Let's take a look at Kumarajiva's translated "Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra" "Universal Gate Chapter of Guanyin Bodhisattva" (this is a more popular translation), which describes a Bodhisattva who saves people from suffering and difficulty. Which kind of people's suffering can she save? -
    "If there are also people who, when about to be harmed, call upon the name of Guanyin Bodhisattva, the knives and sticks they hold will be broken into pieces and they will be liberated. ... Suppose there are also people, whether guilty or not, who are tied up with shackles, fetters, and locks, and call upon the name of Guanyin Bodhisattva, all will be broken."
    These sufferings are all caused by social contradictions and struggles, and are the sufferings that only the oppressed and persecuted people will suffer.
    The verses are written even more bluntly:
    "Or encountering the suffering of the king, about to die at the execution, reciting the power of that Guanyin, the knife will be broken into pieces.
    "Or imprisoned in shackles, hands and feet tied, reciting the power of that Guanyin, they will be released."
    This "Guanyin power" simply ignores the "king's law" and confronts the king. And he "can give fearlessness in the midst of fear and difficulty, therefore this Saha world is called the giver of fearlessness."
    What is also worth noting is that at most, only the suffering of merchants is mentioned here (such as "entering the sea" to find treasures, or "carrying heavy treasures and passing through dangerous roads," Guanyin Bodhisattva can insure), but not a word is mentioned about the suffering of emperors, nobles, or landlords.
    He not only saves people from suffering and difficulty, and can give fearlessness, but also -
      "Curses and all kinds of poisons, those who want to harm others, reciting the power of that Guanyin, will return to the person himself."
    Then, Guanyin Bodhisattva is simply a god of revenge.
    I don't remember where I saw it in a book, saying that Su Shi once saw these verses at Foyin's place, and thought that the last two sentences were too powerful, and wanted to change them to "reciting the power of that Guanyin, both sides will be fine." Foyin agreed, and so on. If it were really changed like this, Guanyin Bodhisattva would certainly be much gentler (changing from a "giver of fearlessness" who breaks shackles and takes revenge to a peacemaker), but she would be much more distant in the hearts of the ordinary people.
    It is not surprising that such a character - the incarnation of the power to relieve suffering, the incarnation of the fearless power of revenge - is felt to be kind by the ordinary people.
    (Compare another character in the "Lotus Sutra" - called "Never Disparaging Bodhisattva" - who willingly accepts all harm and insults, and also respectfully tells the other party: "I dare not disparage you, you will eventually become Buddhas" [meaning something like this]. This Bodhisattva is not at all popular among our folk.)
    The "Lotus Sutra" also writes that Guanyin Bodhisattva sometimes "appears in the body of a woman to preach the Dharma," and folk legends gradually fix this "woman's body," finally becoming a woman. In "The Complete Collection of Gods Searched by the Three Teachings," there is a very complete story, saying that she is the third princess of a king, and because of resisting marriage, the father king wanted to burn her to death, wanted to kill her, and she "did not change her color and her will became more firm." She was imprisoned in the cold palace, everyone persuaded her bitterly, she did not listen, "and angered her father by losing her words, the father was furious," and ordered her to be killed. Although it is written that her resistance is for "wanting to end worldly affairs" (wanting to become a monk), and the result is formulaic (as usual, she is saved due to some miracles), it always writes about a very determined and unyielding woman who resists to the end - a character loved and praised by the folk.
    In this way, this has almost become a tradition: Guanyin Bodhisattva who appears in folk works is always a positive character, and is often a woman. Even "Journey to the West" - satirizes and ridicules every Buddha and god in the celestial realm, but takes a different attitude towards Guanyin, writing her as kind and approachable, and some places even write her very beautifully.

    “西游记”札记
    张天翼
    编者按：这篇文章原载“人民文学”一九五四年二月号。作者在这里实事求是地分析了“取经”故事的形成和发展过程，合情合理地说明了“西游记”的现实内容和社会意义，批判了对这部作品的曲解，使读者认识西游记的真实面目。这是研究古典文学作品应取的观点、方法和态度，可供大家参考。
    关于题材、主题和作者的态度
    一
      “西游记”（杨志和的四十一回本和吴承恩的百回本）以前的作品，现在我们可以见到的，有“大唐三藏取经诗话”（商务印书馆“标点宋人平话”本，不全），有吴昌龄的杂剧“唐三藏西天取经”（上海杂志公司“元人杂剧全集”第四集），都是写取经故事的。
      “似取经故事，自唐末以至宋元，乃渐渐演成神异，且能有条贯，小说家因亦得取为记传也。”（鲁迅：“中国小说史略”一六四面）
    那么“西游记”故事，是大约六百年来（从唐末到明代的杨志和和吴承恩）流传于民间，经过许多人创造，取舍，增删，修改，加工，才发展成这个样子的。
    二
    我们知道玄奘是一个历史人物。他到印度去求经，其实并不是奉旨，倒是“结侣陈表，有诏不许”。别人都退缩了，只有他不灰心，作好了一切准备，一个人偷偷地出了境。经历了许多艰难困苦，游了五十余国，凡十七年，取了佛典六百多部回国。于是组织译场，从事翻译，到死为止。
    他的一个学生（慧立）写了一部传记，叫做“大唐慈恩寺三藏法师传”〔一〕（十卷，有支那内学院印本）。看了这部传记，就知道玄奘是个很有毅力，不肯对困难低头的人，而且是个伟大的翻译家。是这样一个人物。
    假如我们写起这个题材来，我想，大概谁都会着眼在这一方面的。我们得好好表现出他那“诚重劳轻”的意志力，他的工作精神等等，不是么。
    可是那时所流传的取经故事——却不这样处理。那些作者有意无意地在这个故事里渗进了一些奇迹，越渗越多，致使这个历史故事变了质，成了神魔故事。而玄奘这个人物也就渐渐变成了神，不是原来的凡人了。
    至于我们所注意的玄奘的那些品质特性，只不过是一个凡人的品质特性——这对于一位有诸天佛神护佑的唐僧（玄奘），还有什么必需呢？因此它们在这故事里就渐渐褪了色，一直褪到没有，而换上了别的东西：一切艰难困苦都化而为妖魔，而克服困难的力量则是神的力量了。
    这样，玄奘对困难的斗争，就变成了神与魔的矛盾和斗争。
    三
    这类故事是怎样写出来的？
    当然，神魔在现实中并不存在，是作者想像出来的。可是想像，首先就得有原料——要拿他在现实中所见所闻所感受到的东西来做原料。然后他凭自己的好恶，看法，希望等等，从这大堆原料里选出一些他所中意的和对他有用的来，重新组织，加工，而创造出想像的或幻想的东西。
    人们总是按照自己的生活方式，想法等等，去设想天堂地狱的。
    所以这些神魔故事——不论作者自己有没有意识到——总会或多或少，或显或隐，或深或浅，或正确或歪曲地反映出某一时代社会生活的某些方面：而这，当然是通过当时某一阶级或阶层人的思想感情来反映的，因此这些故事里面同时也就表现了某一阶级或阶层的感情态度（爱什么，憎什么）和批评态度（肯定什么，否定什么），或是表现了他们的理想（例如一个好天堂之类）。
    这取经故事里所写的：一边是神，神是高高在上的统治者，上自天界，下至地府，无不要俯首听命。一边是魔——偏偏要从那压在头上的统治势力下挣扎出来，直立起来，甚至于要造反。天兵天将们要去收伏，魔头们要反抗，就恶斗起来了。
    这就使我们联想到封建社会的统治阶级与人民——主要是农民——之间的矛盾和斗争。
    那些作者是不是有意地明确地借天界佛神来描写地主、贵族和皇帝，借妖怪们的造反来描写农民起义呢？那可很难说。我们只是说，当时封建社会
  （鸦片战争以前）的主要阶级关系和矛盾，在这里多少是给反映了出来的：而且，这故事愈经演变，愈发展，这一点就给反映得愈明显。到了“西游记”，我们甚至于要猜想作者是多少有意识地来表现这一点的了。
    四
    根据我们现在看得到的东西（慧立写的传，散见于“太平广记”里的传说片段，以及“大唐三藏取经诗话”，“唐僧西天取经”杂剧，到四十一回本和百回本的“西游记”），则这取经故事自唐末以来的“渐渐演成神异”，我想，也许可以叙述成这样——
    起初不过是把玄奘稍为神化了一下（连慧立写的传里都有这个倾向）。这说不定就是一些佛教信徒传开来的：古时候的宗教信徒往往不大愿意把自己的祖师描写成一个凡人。而有神则必有魔。后来这神魔故事一发展，就在神与魔的矛盾和斗争里反映出当时统治阶级与人民的矛盾和斗争，于是一些卫护封建统治阶级“正统”的脚色就有心无心地加以修造和加工，这就渐渐成了一个惩恶劝善的故事了——这里的所谓“善”“恶”，当然是封建统治阶级所谓的“善”“恶”。
    你看，胜利总是在统治阶级神的那一方面。连孙悟空那样一个有本领的魔头，终于也投降了神，——叫做“皈依正道”。他保唐僧到西天去取经，一路上和他过去的同类以至同伴作恶斗，立了功，结果连他自己也成了神，——叫作成了“正果”。
    神是正，魔是邪，而邪不敌正：这就构成了这个取经故事的主题（这在“取经诗话”和“取经”杂剧里就已经很明显了）。
    可是，这个故事也和其他许多神魔故事的命运一样，它既然流传于民间——也就是流传于农民和市人（手工业者，小商人，以至军士，皂隶，落魄士人，流民等等）之间，就渐渐地变得不那么简单，不那么纯粹了。因为这个故事在流传之际，这些老百姓就也有心无心地照自己的意思来描写，取舍，增删，修改，加工。老百姓自己也来参与这个故事的创作工作。
    主题仍旧没有变：正邪相争，而邪不敌正。但至于正统方面究竟是怎么样个“正”法，邪统方面又究竟是怎么样个“邪”法，哪一方面的人可憎，哪一方面的人可爱，——老百姓却有自己的看法，有自己的态度。他们凭自己的好恶，看法，来描写那两方面的人物，生活，活动等等。一些流传于民间的神魔故事，往往就会这么逐渐变了样子，那里面的妖魔就越变越可爱了，——有的甚至变成了正面的英雄人物。
    取经故事就是这样的。发展到“西游记”——不但和“取经诗话”（似乎是摹拟佛经故事的）简直是两种作品，就是比起“取经”杂剧来，精神面貌也大不相同了。
    如果说“取经”杂剧还是一部唐僧传，那么“西游记”里真正的主人公却成了孙悟空。如果说  “取经”杂剧里的诸天佛神都给描写成那么庄严妙相，而魔头们多半是些瞎胡闹的脚色；那么“西游记”里的诸天佛神却都给描写成那么可笑可憎（作威作福，而又昏庸，欺软怕硬），而魔头们里面倒很有些可爱的脚色。
    总不会有哪位读者由于“西游记”的影响，而至心朝礼起玉皇大帝或如来佛或太上老君来的吧。我们读者心里倒是向着大闹天宫的孙悟空，同情着在高家庄招亲做庄稼的猪刚鬣，以及失去了爱儿的牛魔王和铁扇公主等等，而惋惜他们的失败。在“西游记”所写的这个世界里，所谓“正”“邪”之分并不是凭的什么合理不合理，正义不正义，而是凭的暴力。
    于是，就这方面说来，“西游记”就成了这么一种作品：在那原来的卫护封建正统的故事主题和题材里，却多多少少表现了人民的反正统情绪。同一主题和题材，也是可能写出意义不同、作用不同的，有时甚至是相反的作品来的。
    “西游记”就是这么矛盾的一部作品。
    五
    问：如果说这个故事是经过民间作者的创造的，那么那些民间作者大可以把这个矛盾解决好，比如说，来一个翻案：孙悟空大闹天宫——不让他失败，而让他胜利，如何？
    可是，孙悟空是怎样胜利的？而胜利之后又将怎样？——这是作者不得不首先搞清楚的问题。
    我们假如批评那些参与“西游记”的创作的民间作者，说他们本应该让孙悟空去明确地知道农民革命的目标和依靠什么阶级，那是可笑的。我们知道，那时的历史还没有发展到可以使他们创造出这样的人物来。那时（鸦片战争以前）的农民起义，还往往只是自发性的行动，起义的农民往往提不出一个明确的要求，当然更无从自觉到自己就是历史的真正创造者了。
    因此“西游记”的作者们只会让孙悟空去闹闹天宫。而究竟要闹出怎样一个局面来，起先连孙悟空自己都也模里模糊。直到如来佛问起他，他这才忽然想到了玉帝的尊位（第七回）——“只教他搬出去，将天宫让与我，便罢了”。
    这就不难明白第二个问题（胜利之后又将怎样）了：假如孙悟空闹成了功，那也不过是玉皇大帝改姓了孙，就像刘邦朱元璋之乘着农民起义运动的高潮而爬上了龙位一样——自己成了地主头儿和统治者，而农民又照样被那换了姓的主子剥削着压迫着，终至于又闹造反。
    那时的作者们从历史上所能见到的，不过如此。至于每次的农民起义战争在历史上多少会起些什么进步作用，他们是还看不出来的。
    那么，这些作者即使来一个翻案，写孙悟空闹天宫胜利了，成功了，那也不过是把“正统”从失去宝座的那位玉帝那里夺过来，捧给新登宝座的这位玉帝而已：那仍旧成了卫护封建正统的故事主题。那么，还是不可能解决这部作品的矛盾。
    现在孙悟空造反不成，作者们就只看见有这么两条路摆在孙悟空面前：或者是像赤眉、黄巾、黄巢、方腊他们那样，被地主统治阶级血腥镇压下去了；或者是像“水浒”（百回本或百二十回本等）里所写的宋江他们那样，受了地主统治阶级的“招安”。
    “西游记”写孙悟空走了后一条路。
    当然，至于投降以后又怎么样，则各有不同。比如，“水浒”是写宋江他们征了辽，为“朝廷”出了许多力，立了功之后，一百单八弟兄中间起了分化，而居官的宋江吴用他们终于为统治阶级所害。而“西游记”——却写孙悟空三弟兄终于成了
  “正果”，只是在成“正果”的过程中，展露出一些矛盾，把诸天佛神那些统治者的面貌勾下来，嘲笑了一番而已。
    不但如此。即使这些作者暴露了嘲笑了封建的统治者们，我们也还是不能认为他们是在明确地反对封建主义或是反对封建阶级。他们还不可能有这样的认识。甚至他们脑袋上还难免多多少少给箍上了当时统治思想的“紧箍儿”，不得不承认封建的统治阶级的“正统”（此外他们不知道有什么正统）。只是一接触到实际，一接触到具体的人物和生活，他们就不期然而然地对统治者们流露出憎恶和鄙视，而在被压迫的邪统这一边感到了一些亲切的属于自己的东西。
    所以，不但作者解决不了“西游记”主题问题上的矛盾，而且我们还发现：这部作品里有些地方作者的立足点是模糊或混乱的：有时候被压迫阶级里的脚色也受到了作者的糟蹋，统治阶级里的脚色有的也受到了作者的赞美——例如观世音菩萨（虽然这也许另外还有原因〔二〕）。
    六
    上面所谈的那些，还只是从一个假设出发的（假设“西游记”里的故事全部创自民间）。实际上，我们知道，这个故事的创造是经过种种人（不同阶级的）之手的。而最后把它写成现在流行的百回本“西游记”的，是吴承恩（约一五一○〔或一五○○〕——一五八○，留下来的作品还有诗文集  “射阳先生存稿”〔三〕有故宫博物院印本）——他就是一个文人，所谓士大夫流（见“中国小说史略”一六八面，“小说旧闻钞”五六——六三面）。
    虽然在他以前，已经有了关于取经故事的许多情节（口头的，或文字的，或演出的），到了杨志和本又经过一番选择和组织，而成了一部完整的长篇结构，可是“杨志和本虽大体已立，而文词荒率，仅能成书；吴则通才，敏慧淹雅，其所取材，颇极广泛，……讽刺揶揄则取当时世态，加以铺张描写，几乎改观”（“中国小说史略”一六九面）。所以百回本并不是简单地仅由选材编写而成的，而实在是这位诗人的天才创作。这以前，还没有见过哪一家写幻想的神魔故事能写得像这么生动，这么艳异多彩，而又这么亲切，这么吸引我们的。
    “又作者禀性，‘复善谐剧’，故虽述变幻恍忽之事，亦每杂解颐之言，使神魔皆有人情，精魅亦通世故，而玩世不恭之意寓焉。”（中国小说史略”一七三面）
    在这里，天界的统治者们——玉皇大帝，太白金星，托塔天王，以至太上老君，如来佛等等，都成了作者“讽刺揶揄”的对象了。
    但当然，不能说作者这就是站到被压迫的造反的这一边来了，更不能说他是在明白地反对封建主义或反对封建阶级。士大夫阶层里这些个别有见地有正义感的分子，可能对封建主义还是忠心耿耿的；他们的批评统治者们，也许不过像焦大之骂贾府而已。他们也许不过是希望这封建的统治者能够更好些，更争气些，更高明些而已。——纵使如此，可是，只要他们的批评真正是中肯的，尖锐的，只要他们真正暴露了统治阶级的真面目，真正打中了统治阶级的痛处，——那么，这样的作品，在这方面是合乎人民的要求的，是可以和人民情绪起共鸣的。
    这样的作者，要是他敢于批评，敢于正视现实，敢于说真话，而且肯去亲近并尊重民间作品，那他就能够从前人所遗下的材料里面去选取那些属于人民的东西，选取人民凭自己的爱憎所创造出来的东西，——因为这正是于他合用的有力的批评武器（而且作者自己既然是士大夫流，他比农民和市人更熟悉更了解统治阶级里那些人物些，那么只要他深入现实，忠于现实，并且有用老百姓喜闻乐见的形式来表现的能力的话，就也可能在原有的民间作品的基础上再提高些，写得更深刻些，更尖锐些）。
    就在这一点上，“西游记”作者和人民——即令出发点彼此不同，即令跨过这一点再往前走的方向也彼此不同，但目前就在这一点上——彼此不约而同地会合了，不知不觉地联结起来了。老百姓觉得这是属于他们自己的作品。
    关于现实性和幻想、寓意等等
      “西游记”里的那些神魔——孙悟空，猪八戒，托塔天王，太白金星等等——都是现实中所不存在的幻想出来的脚色，甚至于很荒唐。但这只是外表。至于这些脚色的实质，他们的性格，思想，感情，活动等等，那的确是现实生活里所常见的那几号“人”。幻想的形式，现实的内容。而这里所说的现实性，比起前面所说（一般神魔故事自然而然“总会或多或少，或显或隐，或深或浅，或正确或歪曲地反映出某一时代社会生活的某些方面”）的那些现实性来，却有更明确，更积极，更直接的现实意义。“西游记”里所写的，其实是那时的一些社会相，只不过采用了原来的神话材料，通过神话形式来表现的而已。
    ×　×　×
    关于魔头们的形象。孙悟空是个猴子，猪八戒是个猪。我们知道，这用来表现这两个“人”的猴和猪的形象，并不是随便乱凑的；要是把孙悟空弄成一个呆头呆脑的猪身，而把猪八戒写成一个活蹦乱跳的猴子，就不适合。为什么用猴子形象来表现孙悟空这号人物就会适合呢？这是由于这号人物和猴子在某几点上有某种程度的相类似，容易使人发生联想之故。否则，人物性格和形象就不统一。
    但要注意，这些相类似——只是在一定的某几点上，在一定的程度上。一超过这一定的限度，就成问题了。究竟人是人，猴子是猴子。超过一定的限度，人的内容和猴子的形象之间就会不对头。
    要是到了这么一个关头——要顾到写“人”，就会写得不像个猴子；要顾到写得像个猴子，就会写得不成其为“人”，——作者该怎么办呢？
    作者要写的如果是文学创作，而不是关于动物形态学的科学报告的话，那他就应当顾到写“人”。在这里，现实性和真实性的问题是在于“人”的内容，而不在于猴或猪的形象。
    我们这里所说的“人”，当然不是指什么一般的抽象的“人”，而是指现实性的具体的人——他们是生活于一定的历史时期里的，有他们的阶级性和阶层性，而这阶级性和阶层性是通过他们的具体的个性来表现的。
    ×　×　×
    还有关于所谓微言大旨的问题。
    当然，像所谓“悟一子”“悟元子”之流那样，把“西游记”看作一部深奥的谈禅讲道的书，是可笑的。可是我们姑且承认“西游记”是有所寓意的吧，“以猿为心之神，以猪为意之驰”等等，以及三藏讲的“心生种种魔生，心灭种种魔灭”等等（“中国小说史略”一七四面）。假定如此，那么“西游记”是一种“借外言之”的“寓言”，意在此（心意）而言寄于彼（猿猪）。为什么可以意在此而言寄于彼呢？因为作者在这彼（猿猪）此（心意）之间，看到有某些方面在某种意义上有某种程度的相类似，——否则这寓言就会不知所云。
    即使我们这样假定，但也要注意，这些相类似——也只是在一定的方面，在一定的意义上，在一定的程度上。一超过这一定的限度，矛盾就暴露出来了。这类寓言，它本身原就是两重性的：一边是譬喻者或象征者，一边是被譬喻者或被象征者，而这两者又各属于不同的范畴。超过一定的限度，这两者之间就会发生矛盾，冲突。
    要是到了这么一个关头——要顾到阐明“三界唯心”的大道理，就不可能把孙悟空猪八戒这些人物写得真实而具体；要顾到把这些人物写得真实而具体，就会把“三界唯心”的大道理撂到一边去——作者该怎么办呢？
    这种寓言形式有这么大的限制性，要用来写一大部现实性的史诗，简直是不可能的。作者所写的如果是现实性的史诗，而不是关于本体论和认识论的哲学文字的话（这只要把孙悟空猪八戒拖来打一个譬喻就行，不用多费笔墨去描写他们自己的生活），那他就得撂下他那套“大旨”，来顾全孙悟空猪八戒这两个人物。就是说，如果要把孙悟空猪八戒这两个人物写得真实而具体，就决不能把他们死死地依附在那被譬喻被象征的东西（心意）上，而应当让这两个人物能够独立地存在，让他们像活人一样有自己的生活，有自己的性格，思想，感情，活动等等，有自己的发展。
      “西游记”正是这么办的。不管作者原来的意图如何——是不是旨在“明心见性”，但照他所表现出来的看，却是活生生的人物，是生活。这样，就有了现实性。
    只是在回目上用了些“心猿”，“本性”，“二心”等字样而已。有些回目——如“外道迷真性，元神助本心”（第三十三回），“群魔欺本性，一体拜真如”（第七十七回）等等——我疑心是各种各色（或释，或道，或理学）的“悟一子”“悟元子”之流窜改的，想用回目来点出“大旨”，而其实和内容不相干（光看回目，决想不起是些什么内容）。
    再看作者的写“群魔”——倒是个个都有来历，有下场，而其魔之所以为魔，也交代了那种种原因。那么这“种种魔”就不是由唐僧的“心”所生，也不是唐僧的“心”所能控制的了。即使三藏此心真正能够寂然不动，也还是有“群魔”要闹出事情来的。这“群魔”明明是客观的存在，是统治阶级的对立体。这么着，这部作品有了这样的现实性——这现实性就恰恰否定了“心生种种魔生”的说法。
    ×　×　×
    “西游记”里还有这样的话头：
    “人心生一念，天地尽皆知。善恶若无报，乾坤必有私。”——凡两见：第八回，第八十七回。
    假如作者抽象地概念化地来处理这“天地”和“乾坤”——它们虽然被作者拟人化，可并不是现实性的具体的人，而只是超出世间一切利害关系之外的公正无私的最高裁判者——那么，也许可能使读者相信这四句话，而乖乖地听命于天，小心在意地皈敬“正道”，不敢生什么“犯上”作乱的念头。
    可是“西游记”作者不这样处理。他却把这
  “天地”“乾坤”的代表都写成有血有肉的活生生的“人”：这些天界的神道们并不是什么超出世间一切利害关系的无私的裁判者，而是自己亲身参加到这利害斗争中的一个集团，——而且这个集团也不能算是“善”的代表。
    孙悟空之所以败于玉帝他们之手，难道是由于孙悟空作了什么“恶”而得的报应么？我们说，一点也不是。作者笔底下的孙悟空，是一个现实性的具体的“人”（并不是一个抽象的概念的恶魔化身），使我们了解他的性格，思想，感情，欲求，活动：我们不但不觉得他这是“恶”，而且还觉得他可爱，同情他，心向着他。他的失败，更不是什么“恶”不敌“善”，只是由于种种原因，力量不敌而已。
    那么，那四句话写在这个地方——不论作者主观意图如何，但就这作品所表现的人物及其生活看来——那“善”“恶”和“无私”等字样是应当带上引号的，因为它们恰恰成了一种讽刺。
    ×　×　×
    那么，这很明白：正由于“西游记”里写出了人物，写出了他们的性格，思想，感情，欲求，活动，写出了神道们怎样个“正”法，魔头们怎么样个“邪”法，而孙悟空他们“弃邪归正”之后又有些什么矛盾（思想方面和行动方面）等等，——这样，才表现得出哪边的人可爱，哪边的人可憎，才表现得出人民的反正统情绪。
    假如作者不去接触具体的人物和生活，不去接触现实，而只是概念化地来处理这个主题——神是正，魔是邪，而邪不敌正——这部作品就会成了地主统治阶级的惩恶劝善的滥调。
    如果说，“西游记”在这方面是多多少少表现了些人民性，那么这人民性是通过现实性表现出来的。在这里，概念化和人民性是互不相容的。
    附　注：
    〔一〕在我国古代的传记文学里，还没见过像“大唐慈恩寺三藏法师传”这样完整的大部头的作品。其中虽然有许多地方是佛教徒的渲染和幻想（有些地方是对某些自然现象的不了解而演为奇迹，有些地方则是把这位玄奘法师神化了），但大致是真实的纪事。可以看出玄奘之为人，他的学习精神和工作精神等等。关于他在旅途中怎样克服困难——尤其是从西出国境到高昌国的一段，写得非常动人。从文体上，也可以看出初唐的作者怎样徘徊于骈、散之间。
      〔二〕观世音大概是在民间最受欢迎的一个菩萨了。我小时候看见浙江的一些信佛的农村妇女，嘴里念的虽然是“南无阿弥陀佛”，有兴趣的可还是观音菩萨，一开口就谈不完，好像谈着自己的姐妹似的那样亲切。观音之受爱戴，总由来已久了。慧立的玄奘传（卷一）里就说到玄奘在万分困难之际念观世音菩萨名号，后来学会了“心经”之后，才觉得念“心经”更有力量些，而“心经”里的“观自在菩萨”其实就是“观世音”的另一译名。
    观世音究竟是怎样一个人物，为什么这样受人欢迎？
    “法华经”里描写了几个大乘佛教里的理想人物，观世音菩萨就是其中之一。我们看看鸠摩罗什译的“妙法莲华经”“观世音菩萨普门品”（这是比较流行的一种译本）罢，这里写出了一位救苦救难的菩萨。能够救哪种人的苦难呢？——
    “若复有人，临当被害，称观世音菩萨名者，彼所执刀杖，寻段段坏，而得解脱。……设复有人，若有若无罪，杻械枷锁，检系其身，称观世音菩萨名者，皆悉断坏。……”
    这些苦难，都是社会的矛盾和斗争所引起的，而且是被压迫被迫害的人民才会遭受的苦难。
    偈语里可写得更露骨：
    “或遇王苦难，临刑欲寿终，念彼观音力，刀寻段段坏。
    “或囚禁枷锁，手足被杻械，念彼观音力，释然得解脱。”
    这“观音力”简直是目无“王法”，和王者对抗了。而且他“于布畏急难之中，能施无畏，是故此娑婆世界，皆号之为施无畏者”。
    还有值得注意的是，这里至多只提到了商人的苦难（如为了觅宝而“入于大海”，或“赍持重宝，经过险路”，观世音菩萨可以保险），可是没有一个字提到帝王、贵族或地主们的苦难。
    他不但救苦救难，能施无畏，而且——
      “咒诅诸毒药，所欲加害者，念彼观音力，还著于本人。”
    那么，观世音菩萨简直是个复仇之神了。
    不记得在什么书上看来的了，说是苏轼有一次在佛印那里看了这几句偈语，认为后面两句太厉害，想改为“念彼观音力，两边皆无事”。佛印首肯，云云。要是真正这么一改，观世音菩萨当然要温和得多（从一个打破枷锁的复仇的“施无畏者”变而为一个和事老），可是在老百姓心目中就会要疏远得多了。
    这样一个人物——解救苦难的力量的化身，大无畏的复仇力量的化身——而使老百姓感到亲切，那是不足怪的。
    （比较一下“法华经”里另一个人物——叫做“常不轻菩萨”——对一切损害和侮辱都甘心顺受，而且还恭恭敬敬地告诉对方：“我不敢轻于汝等，汝等终当成佛”〔大意如此〕。这位菩萨在我们的民间就一点也吃不开。）
    “法华经”里还写观世音菩萨有时“现妇女身而为说法”，民间传说里就渐渐使这“妇女身”固定下来，终于成了一个妇女。在“三教搜神大全”里就有了一个很完整的故事了，说她是一个国王的三公主，因为抗婚，父王要烧死她，要杀她，而她“色不变而志愈坚”。她被囚到冷宫里，大家苦劝，她不听，“反失语激父，父大怒”，立命斩讫。虽然写她的反抗是为了“欲了人间事”（要出家），而且那结果是公式化的（照例是由于一些奇迹而得救），可是总写出了一个非常坚决顽强的反抗到底的女性——为民间所喜爱所歌颂的性格。
    就这样，这几乎成了个传统：在民间作品里出现的观世音菩萨，总往往是正面人物，而且往往是妇女。就连“西游记”——对天界的哪一位佛神都讽刺揶揄，可是对观音就另外一种态度，把她写得可亲近，有的地方还写得很美。
    〔三〕这部“存稿”里可找不出一点和“西游记”的创作直接有关系的消息。可是我们如果要研究研究这位作者，却可以从这里得到一些有用的资料。可以知道他的家世（见“先府君墓志铭”等篇），知道他还写过一部“禹鼎志”（也是小说之类，见“禹鼎志序”）。又有些篇数表现了他对于当时社会世态的批评（“贺学博未斋陶师膺奖序”），他的美学见地（“序伎赠写真李山人”），以及他的丰富的想像和幻想（例如“金陵客窗对雪戏柬朱祠曹”，“海鹤蟠桃篇”，“二郎搜山图歌”几首诗），——这令我们联想到“西游记”，虽然后者要生动多彩得多。
