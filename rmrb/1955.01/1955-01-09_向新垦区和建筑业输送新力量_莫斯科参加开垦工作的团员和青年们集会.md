Sending New Strength to New Reclamation Areas and the Construction Industry
Moscow Youth League Members and Youths Gather to Participate in Reclamation Work

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, Eighth. According to TASS Moscow: The Communist Youth League members and youths of Moscow City and Moscow Oblast who have applied to participate in this year's reclamation work held a meeting on January 7th at the Soviet Grand Theater.

Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Malenkov and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party Khrushchev attended the meeting.

Secretary of the Moscow Oblast Committee of the Soviet Lenin Communist Youth League, Khalteyev, delivered the opening speech. He congratulated the Communist Youth League members and youths who volunteered to participate in this year's reclamation work. He said that now, tens of thousands of young activists are applying to participate in the reclamation of wasteland. In the last three days alone, more than 3,000 young people in Moscow City and Oblast have submitted applications to the Communist Youth League organizations.

Secretary of the Central Committee of the Lenin Communist Youth League, Shelepin, then spoke at the meeting. In his speech, he pointed out that the reclamation of wasteland is a great national undertaking, in which Soviet youth should play an active role. Last spring, in a short period of time, Communist Youth League organizations in various states across the country had more than 100,000 young men and women volunteering to work in the reclamation areas. They established 124 state-owned farms in the reclamation areas, reclaimed a large amount of wasteland, and gloriously completed the lofty tasks assigned to them by the Communist Party, the Soviet government, and the people. Shelepin emphasized that now, the Communist Youth League members of Moscow City and Oblast have once again become the initiators of this great and glorious cause, and their initiative and proposals will be widely supported by Soviet youth.

Also speaking at the meeting were Kochetkov, a tractor driver from the Lenin Machine Tractor Station in Moscow Oblast who volunteered to participate in this year's reclamation work, Kuznetsova, an agronomist from the Kuntsevo District, and Lomteva, a former worker at the Moscow Kaganovich First Ball Bearing Factory who participated in the reclamation work in the spring of 1954.

First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party Khrushchev delivered a long speech at the meeting, which was warmly welcomed by the attendees.

The meeting unanimously adopted a letter to the Communist Youth League members and youths of the whole country, calling on them to actively participate in the reclamation work.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, Eighth. The Soviet Union will continue to reclaim wasteland on a large scale this year.
