　　On the eve of the Spring Festival, this reporter visited the family of military serviceman Zhang Xi-hui in the Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Lüjia Village, Yishui County, Yimeng Mountain area.

　　Zhang Xi-hui's home was spotlessly clean. A horizontal plaque reading "Honoring Family" and a portrait of Chairman Mao hung in the center of the main room. On the left wall, a photo of his son, Zhang Chang-ji, who is serving at the front lines, was displayed in a frame. Flour, pork, fish, dried shrimp, kelp, brown sugar, and other items for the Spring Festival were also prepared. Old man Zhang pointed to these things and happily said to me, "Since joining the cooperative, this year's Spring Festival is different from previous years. We've bought more things than in the past."

　　Zhang Xi-hui is an elderly man over sixty years old. His fourth son sacrificed himself in the Liberation War, and his second son, Zhang Chang-ji, is currently serving at the front lines. Now, only he, his wife, and his daughter live at home. In previous years, although the village's substitute farming was also very considerate, the Zhang Xi-hui family's life was never very affluent and often relied on government subsidies. In the winter of 1953, Zhang Xi-hui joined the Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative in his village. Although Zhang Xi-hui and his wife were old, they actively requested to participate in collective labor. The cooperative appropriately assigned them some light work to do based on their physical strength. His daughter, Zhang Yu-lan, is a member of the Communist Youth League. Because of her good labor and active work, she was elected as the captain of the fifth production team after joining the cooperative. In last year's post-autumn production appraisal of the whole cooperative, she was again elected as the cooperative's labor model.

　　This year, the Zhang family earned a total of one hundred and fifty-five workdays; including land dividends, the total annual income was three thousand one hundred and eighty-two jin of grain. After paying agricultural taxes and reserving food rations, they also sold nine hundred and forty-four jin of surplus grain to the state. Before the Spring Festival, the whole family used the money from selling surplus grain to buy more than forty chi of cloth. The two elderly people each made a new cotton-padded coat, and their daughter Yu-lan also made a new set of cotton clothes. In addition, they bought a piglet and saved over two hundred thousand yuan in the bank.

　　When we talked about the various changes before and after joining the cooperative, the old man became more and more excited. He said, "Now I don't have to worry about the work in the fields anymore. The cooperative plans everything very carefully. After the grain is harvested, the cooperative members deliver the grain that is due to me. The cooperative cadres also often come to my home to solicit opinions."

　　On the evening of January 14th, Old Man Zhang Xi-hui's family held a family meeting to welcome the Spring Festival. At this meeting, the whole family discussed the cooperative's production plan for this year. After the meeting, they also wrote a letter to Chang-ji at the front lines, telling him about the changes in their family life and encouraging him to resolutely liberate Taiwan.

    光荣人家迎春节
    新华社记者  台旭
    春节前夕，记者在沂蒙山区的沂水县吕家庄前进农业生产合作社里，访问了军属张熙会的家庭。
    张熙会的家里收拾得干干净净。堂屋正中悬挂着“光荣人家”的横匾和毛主席像。左侧墙上的镜框里，放着在前方的儿子张长吉的照片。过春节用的面粉、猪肉、鱼、干虾、海带、红糖等物品，也已准备齐全。张老大爷指着这些东西高兴地对我说：“自从入了合作社，今年的春节同往年不一样了，买的东西要比过去齐全得多。”
    张熙会已是年过六十岁的老人。第四个儿子在解放战争中牺牲了，第二个儿子张长吉正在前方服务，现在家中只有他和妻子、女儿三个人。在前几年，虽然村里代耕也照顾得很周到，可是张熙会家里的生活总不很宽裕，还常常要靠政府补助。一九五三年冬天，张熙会加入了本村的前进农业生产合作社。张熙会夫妇虽然年纪大了，可是也积极要求参加集体劳动，社里根据他们的体力适当分配一些轻活让他们做。女儿张玉兰是一个青年团员，由于她劳动好、工作积极，入社后便被选为第五生产队的队长。在去年秋后全社的生产评比中，她又当选为社里的劳动模范。
    这一年，张老大爷全家总共得了一百五十五个劳动日；连同土地报酬在内，全年总共收入了三千一百八十二斤粮食。除去交纳农业税和留出口粮外，还向国家出卖了九百四十四斤余粮。春节前，全家用卖余粮的钱买了四十多尺布，两个老人每人做了一件新棉袄，女儿玉兰也做了一套新棉衣。另外还买了一只小猪，并有二十多万元储蓄到银行里。
    当我们谈起参加合作社前后的各种变化时，老人越谈越有劲。他说：“现在地里的活不用我再操心了，社里样样都计划得很周到，粮食打下来后，社员就把我应分的粮食给送来；社里的干部还经常来我家征求意见。”
    一月十四日的晚上，张熙会老大爷全家举行了一次迎接春节的家庭会议。在这个会上，全家讨论了今年社里的生产计划。会后还给在前方的长吉写了一封信，告诉他家中生活的变化，并鼓励他要坚决解放台湾。
