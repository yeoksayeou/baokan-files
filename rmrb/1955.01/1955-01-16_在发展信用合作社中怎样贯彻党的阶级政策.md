    How to Implement the Party's Class Policy in Developing Credit Cooperatives

    In order to meet the needs of the current socialist transformation of the countryside, the national credit cooperative plan is to develop to 130,000 to 150,000 this spring, so that 50% to 70% of the villages have cooperatives. Recently, some readers have raised some questions about how to implement the Party's class policy in the development of credit cooperatives, and the answers are as follows:

    Q: Who can join credit cooperatives? Small vendors and small handicraftsmen in rural areas do not engage in farming. Can they join credit cooperatives?

    A: Credit cooperatives are cooperative economies of the working people under the leadership of the state-owned economy. They serve production and rural collectivization. The people who join credit cooperatives should be limited to poor peasants, middle peasants, and other working people in rural areas. Small vendors and small handicraftsmen in rural areas, such as carpenters, peddlers, garment makers, and pot menders, although they do not cultivate land, they rely on their own labor rather than commercial capital for their livelihood, and they can all join credit cooperatives. Joining a credit cooperative is a political right of the working people. Anyone who is over sixteen years old, voluntarily abides by the charter of the cooperative, fulfills the obligations of a member, is introduced by a member, approved by the board of directors, and pays shares and membership fees, regardless of gender, can join the cooperative. Joining a credit cooperative must be completely voluntary by the members. It is not allowed to force people to join, nor to refuse qualified people to join. In the past, some places only wanted to absorb middle peasants and did not want to absorb poor peasants; or forced middle peasants to join and excluded poor peasants from joining. These practices are wrong. In order to run the credit cooperative well, it is necessary to rely on the poor peasants (including the new middle peasants who were originally poor peasants) and unite with the middle peasants. Because the poor peasants are the most active and enthusiastic members in running credit cooperatives, they have more difficulties in production and life, and they urgently hope to run credit cooperatives well to solve some difficulties and eliminate usury exploitation. The middle peasants are laborers. Although they are slightly better off economically than the poor peasants, they cannot withstand the winds and rains. In case of natural disasters or man-made misfortunes, they also need help from others. Therefore, doing a good job in uniting the poor and middle peasants is an important part of running a good credit cooperative. In order to make it easier for poor farmers to join the cooperative, the shares of the credit cooperative should not be set too high. In general areas, 10,000 to 30,000 yuan per share is better, and in barren areas it should be lowered. Poor peasants who have difficulty in buying shares can be allowed to pay the membership fee first, and then pay the shares in installments or defer payment.

    Since the credit cooperative is a collective economic organization of the working people, the funds are controlled by all the members, and the surplus is owned by all the members, it must not allow rich peasants, landlords, speculators, and exploiters to sneak into the cooperative to make trouble. In the past, some places lost their vigilance against the rich peasants and had problems. Do not repeat this mistake in the future.

    Q: Where does the capital of the credit cooperative come from? Can it absorb deposits from landlords and rich peasants?

    A: There are three sources of funds for credit cooperatives: one is the shares of the members, one is the loans from the state bank, and the other is mass savings deposits, including deposits from landlords and rich peasants. We know that absorbing deposits from non-members is one of the important businesses of credit cooperatives. In order to have a regular and solid financial base for credit cooperatives, it is necessary to take deposit work and carry out mass savings as the main source of mobilizing funds. Because the shares of the members are limited, although the state bank can give a certain amount of loans, it cannot rely solely on state bank loans; at present, the state's investment focus is first on industry, and it is impossible to meet the credit requirements for agricultural production development. Therefore, to solve the source of funds for credit cooperatives, it is necessary to vigorously develop mass savings and deposit business. More deposits mean more loans. If the deposit work is done well, the loan problem will be solved smoothly. After the unified purchase of cotton and grain, the vast majority of farmers have some surplus funds in their hands, and rich peasants and some speculators also have a lot of surplus funds. If credit cooperatives seize the opportunity to mobilize these idle funds to deposit in credit cooperatives, they can avoid intermittent funds and usury activities, and develop credit business to solve production needs. Absorbing deposits from landlords and rich peasants is completely different from not accepting them into the cooperative. Do not confuse them. Landlords and rich peasants deposit in credit cooperatives, which is a business relationship with the credit cooperative. They cannot interfere in the affairs of the cooperative. The credit cooperative only acts in accordance with the charter and cannot lend to them, so it will not affect the nature of the cooperative.

    In order to develop deposit and loan business, credit cooperatives must adhere to their credit for anyone's deposits, and actively carry out credit business. In the past, some credit cooperatives went to various villages to work according to plan. They immediately issued deposit slips or passbooks to those who wanted to deposit, and paid the principal and interest on the spot to those who wanted to withdraw. Some credit cooperatives personally delivered the matured deposits to the depositors' homes. When the depositors felt that they did not need to use them urgently, they continued to handle deposit procedures. This practice is very beneficial to absorbing social idle funds and developing credit business, and it is worth continuing to adopt.

    Q: After the credit cooperative concentrates its funds, how does it handle the loan work? Should loans be granted to different objects?

    A: After the credit cooperative concentrates its funds, its most important task is to give play to the role of this batch of funds and solve the production needs and difficulties of the members. When granting loans, it is necessary to treat different objects specifically.

    First, we must help poor farmers. Credit cooperatives first lending money to poor farmers is a manifestation of the socialist and capitalist struggle in the countryside. Because if socialism does not occupy the lending position in the countryside, capitalism will occupy it. The credit cooperative solves the requirements of poor farmers, and directly combats the exploitation of usury and the activities of speculative merchants.

    Second, loans should be granted to various production cooperative organizations. The consolidation and development of various production cooperative organizations in rural areas is closely related to the consolidation and development of credit cooperation. Credit cooperatives and agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups should sign deposit and loan business contracts to establish the business of credit cooperatives on a solid and reliable basis. We know that the development of production cooperation and agricultural production must have a certain amount of investment. Last year, the total amount of deposits absorbed by credit cooperatives in Shanxi Province in one year was more than 430 billion yuan, and various loans were issued more than 270 billion yuan, which is equivalent to 106.9% of the loans issued by the state bank in the same period. If we do not rely on credit cooperatives but rely solely on the state to invest, it will not be able to meet the needs of production development.

    Third, loans should be granted to other laboring masses who have difficulties in production and life. Of course, the loan targets of credit cooperatives should be mainly members, but the laboring people who are not members and have urgent difficulties in production and life should not be ignored. They must be enthusiastically helped to prevent usury exploitation, and further strive for them to join the cooperative.

    Actively supporting production, developing mutual assistance and cooperation, and fighting rural usury until the final elimination of usury is one of the important tasks of credit cooperative organizations. The basic way to limit and eliminate usury is through the lending work of state banks and cooperatives, and in coordination with the development of the entire cooperative cause, to help poor farmers overcome difficulties in a timely and effective manner, gradually reduce the activity base of usury exploitation, and drive down the interest rate of the entire society. Therefore, the process of eliminating usury is also the process of fighting against the phenomenon of rural poverty. We must resolutely oppose the wrong behavior of lending to rich peasants and commercial speculators in order to pursue profits, and we must also resolutely oppose the credit cooperative itself engaging in commercial speculation and other activities; this is to resolutely oppose the capitalist practice of deviating from the Party's class line.

    Rural credit cooperatives are one of the three forms of rural collectivization. They, together with production cooperation and supply and marketing cooperation, share the task of transforming the small-scale peasant economy. Now that mutual assistance and production cooperation have been greatly developed, if the work of credit cooperation cannot keep up, it will affect the pace of socialist transformation in the countryside. Therefore, it is completely appropriate to plan to develop 130,000 to 150,000 credit cooperatives across the country this spring.

### 在发展信用合作社中怎样贯彻党的阶级政策

    在发展信用合作社中怎样贯彻党的阶级政策
    为了适应当前农村社会主义改造的需要，全国信用合作社计划在今春要发展到十三万个到十五万个，做到百分之五十到七十的乡都有社。近来，有些读者对发展信用合作社怎样贯彻党的阶级政策方面提出了一些问题，现答复如下：
    问：哪些人才能参加信用合作社？农村中的小商贩、小手工业者都不从事耕种，他们是否可以参加信用合作社？
    答：信用合作社是国营经济领导下的劳动人民的合作经济，它是为生产服务，为农村合作化服务的。参加信用合作社的人应该限于贫农、中农和农村中的其他劳动人民。农村中的小商贩、小手工业者如木匠、货郎担、做被服的手工业者、修缸补锅的工匠等人，虽然不耕种土地，但是，他们都是靠自己劳动吃饭，而不是靠商业资本剥削吃饭，都可以参加信用合作社。参加信用合作社是劳动人民的一种政治权利，要求入社的人只要年纪满了十六岁，自愿遵守社的章程，尽社员的义务，经过社员介绍，理事会批准，缴纳股金和入社费，不论性别就可以入社。参加信用合作社必须完全由社员自愿，决不能强迫加入，也不能拒绝有条件的人参加；过去，有的地方只愿吸收中农，不愿吸收贫农参加；或者强迫中农入社，排斥贫农入社，这种做法都是不对的。为了要把信用合作社办好，必须依靠贫农（包括原为贫农的新中农），团结中农。因为贫农是举办信用合作、社最积极最热心的分子，他们生产和生活上的困难较多，迫切希望办、好信用合作社，解决一些困难，免除高利贷剥削。中农是劳动者，虽然在经济上比贫农略微好些，但也经不起风吹雨打，万一遇到天灾人祸，也需要别人帮助。所以搞好贫农和中农的团结，是搞好信用合作社的重要一环。为使贫困农民入社不致有什么困难，信用合作社的股金不宜订得太高，一般地区每股一万元到三万元较好，贫瘠地区应降低一些；贫农入股有困难的，可以允许他们先交入社费，然后分期或缓期交纳股金。
    信用合作社既然是劳动人民集体的经济组织，资金由全体社员支配，盈余为全体社员公有，就决不能让富农、地主、投机商人和剥削分子混进社里来捣乱。过去有个别地方曾经对富农失去警惕，出了毛病，今后不要重复这个错误。
    问：信用合作社的资金从哪里来？能不能吸收地主、富农的存款？
    答：信用合作社的资金来源有三：一个是社员的股金，一个是国家银行的贷款，再一个是群众储蓄存款，这包括地主、富农的存款在内。我们知道，吸收社外存款是信用合作社的重要业务之一，为使信用合作社有着经常巩固的资金基础，必须把存款工作和开展群众性的储蓄作为动员资金的主要来源。因为社员的股金是有限的，国家银行虽然可以给予一定的贷款，但不能单靠国家银行贷款；目前国家投资重点首先是工业，不可能满足农业生产发展的信贷要求。因此，解决信用合作社的资金来源，必须大力开展群众储蓄和存款业务，存款多，放款才多，存款工作做好了，放款问题才会顺利解决。在棉粮统购以后，广大农民手里都存放了一些余款，富农和某些投机商人也有不少的余款，如果信用合作社抓紧时机，动员这些游资存到信用合作社来，既可以免除资金间歇和高利贷的活动，又可以发展信贷事业，解决生产需要。吸收地主、富农存款和不接收他们入社完全是两回事情，不要混淆起来。地主、富农在信用合作社存款，是和信用合作社发生业务关系，他们不能干预社内事务，信用合作社也只是按章程办事，不能贷款给他们，因此决不会影响社的性质。
    为了发展存放业务，信用合作社对于任何人的存款都要坚守信用，而且要积极主动地去开展信贷业务。过去，有的信用合作社按照计划深入到各村去办公，要存款的就立即开给存单或存折，要取款的就当场付给本息，还有的信用合作社把到期的存款亲自送到存户家里，存户感到不需急用时就继续办理存款手续，这种做法对于吸收社会游资，开展信用业务有很大好处，值得继续采用。
    问：信用合作社集中了资金以后怎样办理放款工作？是否要分别对象进行放款？
    答：信用合作社集中了资金以后，它的最重要的任务就是要发挥这一批资金的作用，解决社员生产上的需要和困难。在放款时一定要分别对象，具体对待。
    第一，要扶助贫困的农民。信用合作社首先把款放给贫困农民，是农村的社会主义和资本主义展开斗争的表现。因为农村的借贷阵地社会主义不去占领，资本主义必去占领，信用合作社解决了贫困农民的要求，就直接打击了高利贷的剥削和投机商人的活动。
    第二，要放给各种生产合作组织。农村中的各种生产合作组织的巩固和发展，同信用合作的巩固和发展有着密切的联系。信用合作社和农业生产合作社、互助组应该订立存贷业务合同，把信用合作社的业务建立在稳固可靠的基础上。我们知道，生产合作和农业生产的发展，必须有一定的投资，去年山西全省信用合作社一年来共吸收存款总额为四千三百多亿元，发放各种贷款二千七百多亿元，相当于国家银行同期放款的百分之一百零六点九。如果不靠信用合作社而专靠国家来投资，是不能满足生产发展的需要的。
    第三，要放给生产和生活有困难的其他劳动群众。当然，信用合作社的贷款对象应以社员为主，但对于非社员而在生产和生活上有紧急困难的劳动人民也不应置之不理，必须热情地予以帮助，防止高利贷剥削，并进一步争取他们入社。
    积极扶持生产，发展互助合作和农村高利贷作斗争，直到最后消灭高利贷，是信用合作组织的重要任务之一。限制和消灭高利贷的基本途径，是通过国家银行和合作社放款工作，并配合整个合作事业的发展，及时有效地帮助贫困农民，克服困难，逐步缩小高利贷剥削的活动阵地，带动整个社会利息的下降，因此消灭高利贷的过程，也即是消灭农村贫困现象的斗争过程。我们必须坚决反对为了追逐利润贷款给富农和商业投机分子的错误行为，也必须坚决反对信用合作社本身从事商业投机等勾当；这就是必须坚决反对离开党的阶级路线的资本主义的作法。
    农村信用合作社是农村合作化的三种形式之一，它同生产合作、供销合作共同负有改造小农经济的任务。现在生产互助合作大大发展了，如果信用合作的工作跟不上去，就会影响农村社会主义改造的前进步伐，所以在今春全国计划发展到十三万个至十五万个信用合作社是完全适合时宜的。
