    Heroic Brothers Compete to Enlist in the Military
    Hu Xiutong, a young militiaman from Jinlong Township, Jintang County, Sichuan Province, wrote a letter on December 6, 1954, to his fourth elder brother, Hu Xiudao, a first-class hero and special-class meritorious person of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The letter said, "When the young people here learned about the news that the country was recruiting supplementary soldiers, they were all very happy. Especially me, I just turned eighteen yesterday, just old enough to serve in the military. The thought of soon becoming a People's Liberation Army soldier has made me so excited that I haven't been able to sleep for several nights. I remember when you joined the Volunteer Army in 1951, I was too young to go even if I wanted to, and how envious I was of you! But the obligation to serve in the military has finally come to me..."
    The letter was sent. But the young man's heart could not calm down for a long time. He recalled the suffering of being exploited and robbed by bandits with his parents in his childhood, and said angrily, "Who came to protect us then?" And now? His family lives and works in a peaceful environment, and they no longer often can't even eat two meals of vegetable leaves a day like before liberation, but now have "two meals of dry food and one of porridge." He said, "Socialism is getting closer and closer to us. Now that I have grown up, only by shouldering the sacred duty of defending the country can I protect our happy life."
    His fifth elder brother, Hu Xiuqian, had the same understanding as him. Therefore, the two of them argued about who should enlist in the military. You wanted me to stay at home, and I wanted you to stay at home, until their mother agreed to let them both go, and the two brothers reconciled.

    英雄兄弟争服兵役
    四川省金堂县金龙乡青年民兵胡修桐，曾经在一九五四年十二月六日给他的四哥、中国人民志愿军一级英雄、特等功臣胡修道写了一封信。信上说：“我们这里的青年，知道国家要征集补充兵员的消息以后，都很高兴。特别是我，昨天才满十八岁，刚够服兵役的年龄，想到不久就可以当一名人民战士，兴奋得几晚上睡不着。回想一九五一年你参加志愿军的时候，我因为年纪小，想去也去不成，对你有多羡慕啊！可是，服兵役的义务终于轮到我来执行了。……”
    信寄走了。这个青年的心却久久不能平静，他忆起自己在童年生活中随着父母遭受剥削和土匪抢劫的痛苦，愤怒地说：“那时候有谁来保卫我们？”现在呢？他们一家人在和平环境中生活劳动，每天再不像解放前那样常常连两顿青菜叶子都吃不上，而是“两干一稀”了，他说：“社会主义离我们越来越近了。我现在已经长大，只有去担负起保卫国家的神圣职责，才能保卫住我们的幸福生活。
    他的五哥胡修乾和他有同样的认识，因此，他们两个为了谁去应征服兵役的事争执起来，你想叫我留在家里，我想叫你留在家里，直到母亲答应让他们都去，两兄弟才和好了。
