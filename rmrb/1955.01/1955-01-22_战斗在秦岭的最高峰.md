The workers excavating the Qinling Tunnel on the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway had, by January 15th, dug the 130-meter-deep shaft to the bottom. In this project, the workers demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm for building the motherland.

The Qinling Mountains have entered the depths of winter, with continuous wind and snow, and the snow on the mountains is two to three feet thick. The shaft construction site is the highest peak in the Qinling Mountains, and the snow is particularly heavy. The cold snowflakes whipped by the gale hit the workers' faces. However, the workers pushing the earth-carrying vehicles were sweating profusely, and some workers even took off their coats because they were too hot. The workers carrying materials stumbled and fell on the steep, snowy roads, but they got up, picked up the materials, and ran again. The workers operating the winches and air compressors did not leave their machines for a moment, fearing that the machines would be damaged, so they took off their coats and covered the machines. Wang Weiqin, the team leader in charge of drilling underground, was soaked by the water in the well and looked like a water person. As soon as he came out of the well, his clothes were covered with a layer of ice. Someone asked him to go back to the room immediately, but he only said "Don't be afraid" and went to arrange other work. When the instructor greeted the workers, they said: "In order to build a happy socialism, we are not afraid of anything and can overcome any difficulties!"

The workers are now digging pilot tunnels in the shaft towards both ends of the tunnel. From now on, there will be four working faces for the Qinling Tunnel being excavated simultaneously, and the project progress will be doubled compared to before. The workers proposed: We will use practical actions to break through the Qinling Mountains as soon as possible to support the struggle to liberate Taiwan.

    战斗在秦岭的最高峰
    宝成铁路北段开凿秦岭隧道的工人，在一月十五日已把深达一百三十多公尺的竖井挖到井底。在这一工程中，工人们表现了建设祖国的高度热情。
    秦岭进入隆冬季节，连天风雪，岭上积雪有两三尺厚。竖井工地是秦岭的最高峰，雪格外大。狂风卷着冰冷的雪花，打在工人们的脸上。但是推土斗车的人们却个个满头大汗，有的工人干热了还脱掉大衣。抬运料具的工人，在陡坡的冰雪道路上，跌倒了爬起来，抬起料具又跑。操纵卷扬机、空气压缩机的工人，一时一刻不离开机器，他们怕机器受损，就把大衣脱下来盖在机器上。领导井下开挖的风钻班长王维勤，被井里的水浇得像个水人，他一出井全身衣服就冻了一层冰。有人让他马上回屋里去，可是他只说了声“不怕”，又布置别的工作去了。当指导员向工人们问候时，他们说：“为了建设幸福的社会主义，我们什么都不怕，什么困难都能克服！”
    现在工人们已在竖井中向隧道两端开挖导洞，从此秦岭隧道就有四个工作面同时开挖，工程进度要比以前加快一倍。工人们提出：要用早日打通秦岭的实际行动，支援解放台湾的斗争。
