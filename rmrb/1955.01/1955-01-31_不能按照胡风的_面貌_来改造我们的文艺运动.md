The speaker Mr. Hu Feng, at the enlarged joint meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Writers Association, said that the literary front led by the Party had failed, and his "mood was very heavy." Many readers reflected in the "People's Daily" and "Literary Gazette" that this was an attempt to abolish the Party's leadership on our literary front. Recently, I saw the report submitted by Mr. Hu Feng to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the opinions on literary work, which was attached to the first and second issues of the "Literary Gazette" in 1955. In addition to the theoretical part, there was also a specific suggestion on the future method of the literary movement. From these suggestions of Mr. Hu Feng, I cannot but feel that the readers' reaction in the newspaper is correct. It is true that "the eyes of the masses are discerning!"

The theoretical parts of Mr. Hu Feng's speech are very long and very "profound," but the meaning is very clear. It is to prove that since the national liberation, our literary movement has been completely wrong, and it is "subjectivist theory and sectarian practice" that has caused the vital forces accumulated by the new literature for more than 30 years to "wither." If this is true, then it is no wonder that he is in such a "heavy mood." Therefore, he came up with a specific proposal to completely reform the literary movement, "specifically" stipulating the ratio of party members to non-party member writers writing for each publication and the work of the party branch of the publication. According to him, after the implementation of this "proposal," it can "expand the ranks of the literary front in the process of ensuring the development of creative practice and carrying out ideological struggle." If all his proposals are realized, what will be the situation in our national literary circles?

That is, the current publications "People's Literature," "Literary Gazette," "Literary Study," "Drama," etc., and local publications such as "Literary Monthly," "Yangtze River Literature," etc., as well as "Liberation Army Literature," will all be cancelled. In addition, there will be seven or eight literary publications that are both comprehensive in nature and national in scope. Each publication will be headed by a "writer with leading influence" to unite twenty or thirty writers and become an independent group. Mr. Hu Feng calls this group a "labor cooperation unit." It is said that this can launch a "free competition" in creation. It seems that the creative competition is not among writers to promote the victory of socialist realism creative methods, and to promote the diversity of artistic creation in terms of form, style, and genre, but a free competition among small groups centered on the chief editors of seven or eight publications of the same nature. These seven or eight publications do not ask about the difference in target readers (youth, troops, etc.), regardless of the characteristics of different regions, the content is the same. The difference is the "people" in charge, small groups centered on the so-called "chief editors with leading influence," and then this kind of mutual competition between small groups can be launched. Here he only considers the "chief editors" and the twenty or thirty writers around the chief editors. As for the question of for whom the publication serves the readers, it seems that it can be left out of consideration. In fact, we are not unfamiliar with such publications. If we want to give examples, they are "July," "Hope," "Breathing," "Mud," and so on. These publications are very good at "free competition" with other publications, that is, indiscriminately, they fight indiscriminately. It should be admitted that some people have quite a lot of "experience" in engaging in "small groups."

In his "proposal," every writer must belong to a certain publication, and the relationship between the "chief editor" of each publication and the writers around him is similar to "patriarchal system." Works that the "chief editor" is sure can be published can be published even if all other editors disagree, "the chief editor is personally responsible." Every writer's "lifestyle" is freely chosen, but must be approved by the chief editor. The chief editor has the right to order writers to contact a youth literary organization and maintain regular contact with five selected contributors. The power of the chief editor is absolute. He stipulates that each publication can have one-third of Party and League member writers, but the work of the branch must have two "special guarantees." In fact, it is to make the branch obey the authority of the chief editor and not play any supervisory role on the publication. As for political and ideological leadership, his proposal is to "completely abolish the compulsory study system and focus on self-study." "Writers have the right to decide on study plans and study steps according to their creative situation, and get a guarantee of being free from interference in the creative process." Our study was originally conducted on a conscious basis, and its purpose is to improve the political and professional level of writers, but Mr. Hu Feng said that this is "compulsory study," and he feels that this will "interfere" with creation. Yes, Chairman Mao said long ago that Marxism is to destroy the creative emotions of those who are not the people and not the proletariat.

If Mr. Hu Feng's proposal is realized, each publication is an independent kingdom under the leadership of the chief editor. Seven or eight such publications "freely compete" with each other, and he thinks that this will expand the "literary front." We are also not unfamiliar with this situation. During the Anti-Japanese War and the People's Liberation War, the Kuomintang-ruled areas had this kind of "independent kingdom." No one who wants to pull history backward will miss the "free competition" method at that time.

What kind of people should be the "chief editors"? He believes that they should be writers with leading influence or in a leading position and who have a mass base. As for "various differences and even fundamental differences in the understanding and attitude towards specific issues of literary creation practice," it is irrelevant and will only be resolved in the competition process. His so-called competition is already very close to capitalist "free competition," and even fundamental differences can be ignored. Isn't this abolishing the Party's leadership in literary work?

In addition to literary publications, his proposal also includes parts for drama, film scripts, and broadcasting organizations, but the spirit is consistent, that is, to turn each art unit into an independent small group, emphasizing the individual authority of the chief director or person in charge. Moreover, "the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee should issue a notice to national newspapers, theaters, and broadcasting organizations, etc., that, except for those specially designated, the selection and appointment of literary manuscripts should be based entirely on their own opinions and requirements and be independently responsible." In this way, the entire literary and artistic undertaking, except for traditional opera, will become a small group responsible by individuals. It is said that this can guarantee the vigorousness of creative practice in "free competition." Perhaps that kind of capitalist "free competition" will "vigorous," but whether it can still guarantee the serious task of "educating the people with socialist spirit" is highly doubtful. Mr. Hu Feng is very opposed to what he calls leading literary and artistic undertakings with "administrative working methods." Therefore, he suggests that "the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee should instruct publishing and distribution institutions not to adopt discriminatory attitudes in terms of print runs and distribution scope towards any publication and any work, and be completely based on criticism influence and reader choice." But for Chinese classical literature, which he denies and regards as worthless, he suggests only "publishing a research and discussion publication with a limited print run (three to five thousand copies), preferably distributed in a way that is mainly pre-ordered by general researchers and research institutions." So why not let "readers choose" here? Why does he demand a discriminatory attitude "in terms of print runs and distribution scope"? According to his "theory" on our country's literary heritage, he believes that works produced in feudal society cannot have any "democratic essence" at all. Although he did not make any "suggestions" on the issue of traditional opera, he severely criticized "classical opera driving back drama" in the "theoretical" part for the past few years. Obviously, in his view, these things are all feudal and should be completely cancelled and replaced by drama and film. According to his proposal, it is not difficult to imagine the situation: small groups and small units, with various political tendencies, all attract some people to help around the individual in charge, spreading different influences among the masses. Traditional opera is cancelled or at least "limited," classical literature is not allowed to be read by general readers; literary publications are all comprehensive in nature centered on Shanghai and Beijing, drama and film are based on individual groups; the Party's leadership can only be applied to publications responsible by Party members, and can only be in a "underground" state. He thinks that this can "compete freely"; and the Party must guarantee it, otherwise he thinks that it is to solve literary and artistic problems in an administrative way, that is "subjectivism and mechanism." It seems that only his "proposal" is the most "correct" Marxism-Leninism!

We had better study Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" again, which has already given us principled instructions:

People from petty-bourgeois backgrounds always stubbornly express themselves, propagate their own views, and demand that people transform the Party and transform the world according to the image of petty-bourgeois intellectuals through various methods, including literary and artistic methods. Under such circumstances, our task is to shout loudly to them and say: "Comrades," your set is not working. The proletariat cannot accommodate you. If we follow you, we are actually following the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, and there will be a danger of losing the Party and the country. Who can we rely on? We can only transform the Party and transform the world according to the image of the vanguard of the proletariat. Mr. Hu Feng's "proposal" is actually to transform the Party's literary movement according to his bourgeois literary thought. All literary and artistic workers in the country cannot but shout loudly: "Your set is not working!"

### 不能按照胡风的“面貌”来改造我们的文艺运动

    不能按照胡风的“面貌”来改造我们的文艺运动
    王瑶
    胡风先生在中国文联主席团和作家协会主席团扩大联席会议上的发言中，说党领导的文艺战线失败了，他的“心情很沉重”；许多读者在“人民日报”和“文艺报”上反映，说这是企图取消我们文艺战线上的党的领导。最近我看到了“文艺报”一九五五年第一、二号附送的胡风先生向党中央提出的关于文艺工作的意见的报告。其中除理论问题部分以外，还有一个关于今后文艺运动方式的具体建议，从胡风先生的这些建议中，我不能不感到报上读者的反映是正确的，这真是“群众的眼睛是雪亮的”！
    胡风先生讲理论的那些部分很长，也很“深奥”，但意思却很明白，就是要证明自从全国解放以来，我们的文艺运动全盘都错，是“主观主义的理论和宗派主义的做法”，把三十多年以来新文艺所积蓄的有生力量“都闷得枯萎了”；果真这样，那就无怪他“心情很沉重”了。于是他来了一个彻底改造文艺运动的具体建议，“具体”到把为每一刊物写稿的作家的党员与非党员的比例和刊物的党支部的工作都给规定好了；据他说，这个“建议”实行以后就可以“在保证发展创作实践和进行思想斗争的过程中扩大文艺战线的队伍”，假如他的这些建议都实现了，我们全国文艺界是一种什么样的情况呢？
    那就是，现在有的刊物“人民文学”、“文艺报”、“文艺学习”、“剧本”等，各地的刊物如“文艺月报”、“长江文艺”等，以及“解放军文艺”都被取消了，另外出现了七八个性质都是综合性的和范围都是全国性的文艺刊物，每一个刊物由一个“有领导影响的作家”担负主编，团结二三十个作家，成为一个独立的集团，胡风先生把这种集团叫做“劳动合作单位”；据说这样就可以展开创作上的“自由竞赛”了。好像创作竞赛并不是在作家之间为了促进社会主义现实主义创作方法的胜利，和为了推动艺术创作底形式、风格和体裁的多样性的发展的，而是七八个同性质的刊物之间、以主编为中心的小集团的自由竞赛；这七八个刊物不问读者对象的区别（青年、部队等），不管不同地区的特点，内容性质都是一样的，不同的是主持的“人”，是以所谓“有领导影响的”主编为中心的小集团，然后就可以展开这种小集团之间的互相竞赛了。这里他考虑的只是“主编”和围绕在主编周围的二三十个作家，至于这个刊物是为什么读者服务的问题，似乎是可以不在考虑之内的。其实这样的刊物对我们并不陌生，如果要举例，那就是“七月”、“希望”、“呼吸”、“泥土”等等；这些刊物是很善于和别的刊物“自由竞赛”的，那就是不分青红皂白，乱打一气。应该承认，在搞“小集团”上，有些人是颇有“经验”的。
    在他的“建议”里，每一作家都必须属于一定的刊物，而每个刊物的“主编”对他周围作家的关系是类似“家长制”的。“主编”确信可以发表的作品，其他编辑全部不同意也可以发表，“由主编个人负责”。每一个作家的“生活方式”是自由选择的，但要得到主编的同意。主编有权责成作家联系一个青年文艺社团和与五个被挑选出来的投稿者保持经常的联系。主编的权力是绝对化了的。他规定每一刊物中可以有三分之一的党团员作家，但支部工作必须有两项“特殊保证”，实际上，就是要支部服从于主编的权威，不能对刊物发生任何的监督作用。至于政治思想领导，他的建议是“完全废除强迫学习制度，以自学为主”，“作家有权根据他的创作情况来决定学习计划和学习步骤，得到在创作过程中不受干扰的保证”。我们的学习原是在自觉的基础上进行的，它的目的是提高作家的政治水平、业务水平，但胡风先生却说这是“强迫学习”，他觉得这会使创作受到“干扰”。是的，毛主席早就说过，马克思主义是要破坏那些非人民大众非无产阶级的创作情绪的。
    如果胡风先生的建议实现了，每一个刊物就是一个在主编主持下的独立王国；这样的七八个刊物彼此互相“自由竞赛”，他以为就扩大了“文艺战线”。这样的情况我们也并不生疏，抗战时期和人民解放战争时期的国民党统治区，曾经有过这种“独立王国”，不是想拉着历史向后退的人，谁也不会再留恋当时那样的“自由竞赛”的方式了。
    这样的“主编”由什么样的人来做呢？他认为是要由有领导影响或站在领导地位的、又各各有着群众基础的作家来担任的，至于“对于文艺创作实践的具体问题的理解和态度上有各种差异以至基本性质的分歧”，则是无关紧要的，只有在竞赛过程中去解决；他所谓竞赛已经很近于资本主义的“自由竞争”了，连基本性质的分歧也可以不管了。这不是取消文艺工作中的党的领导吗？
    除了文艺刊物以外，他这个建议还包括话剧、电影剧本和广播机构等部分，但那精神是一贯的，就是把各艺术单位都变成一个个独立的小集团，强调首席导演或负责者个人的职权；而且还要“中央宣传部通令全国报刊、剧团、和广播机构等，除特别指定的以外，选约文艺稿件完全以自己的见解和要求为标准，独立负责”；这样，整个文艺事业除了传统戏曲以外，就都成为个人负责的一个个的小团体了。据说这样就可以在“自由竞赛”中保证创作实践的旺盛，也许那种资本主义的“自由竞争”是会“旺盛”起来的吧，但是否还能保证“以社会主义精神教育人民”的严重任务呢？这就大可怀疑了。胡风先生是很反对他所谓以“行政性质的工作方式”来领导文艺事业的，因此他建议“中央宣传部责成出版机构和发行机构，对任何刊物和任何作品，不得在印数上和发行范围上采取歧视态度，完全以批评影响和读者选择为准。”但对于他所否定的、视为一文不值的中国古典文学，他就建议只
  “出版一限定印数（三、五千份）的研究讨论刊物，顶好主要由一般研究者和研究机构预定的方式发行。”那么为什么这里不让“读者选择”了呢？为什么他要求“在印数上和发行范围上”采取歧视态度呢？按照他的对我国文学遗产的“理论”，他是认为在封建社会中所产生的作品根本不可能有任何
  “民主性的精华”的。对于传统戏曲的问题他虽然没有提什么“建议”，但在“理论”部分却痛骂几年来“古典剧打退了话剧”，显然，在他看来，这些东西都是封建性的，应该完全取消，由话剧电影来代替。照着他这个建议实行起来，那情形也不难想象，一个个的小集团和小单位，其中有各种不同的政治倾向，都以主持者个人为中心吸引了一些帮忙的人，在群众中散布着不同的影响。传统戏曲是取消了或至少被“限定”了，古典文学是不让一般读者阅读的；文艺刊物都是以上海、北京为中心的综合性质的，话剧、电影是以一个个团体为单位的；党的领导只能施于党员负责的刊物，而且也只能处于“地下”状态。他认为这样就可以“自由竞赛了”；还要党保证，否则他认为就是以行政方式解决文艺问题，就是“主观主义和机械论”了。好像只有他这个“建议”才是最“正确”的马克思列宁主义！
    我们最好还是再用心学习一下毛主席的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”罢，那里面早已经给过我们原则性的指示了：
    小资产阶级出身的人们总是经过种种方法，也经过文学艺术的方法，顽强地表现他们自己，宣传他们自己的主张，要求人们按照小资产阶级知识分子的面貌来改造党，改造世界。在这种情形下，我们的工作，就是要向他们大喝一声，说：“同志”们，你们那一套是不行的，无产阶级是不能迁就你们的，依了你们，实际上就是依了大地主大资产阶级，就有亡党亡国的危险。只能依谁呢？只能依照无产阶级先锋队的面貌改造党，改造世界。胡风先生的“建议”实际上就是要按照他的资产阶级文艺思想来改造党的文艺运动。全国文艺工作者都不能不大喝一声：“你的那一套是不行的！”
