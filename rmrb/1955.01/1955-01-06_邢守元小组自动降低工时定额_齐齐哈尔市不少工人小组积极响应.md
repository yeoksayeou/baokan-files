The patriotic action of the Xing Shouyuan group of the Heilongjiang First Machine Tool Factory in Qiqihar City, which voluntarily requested a reduction in work quotas, has had a great impact on factories in Qiqihar City.

Workers in the Xing Shouyuan group greatly improved production efficiency by improving seventeen tools and operating methods, and by reducing auxiliary time in production. As a result, the original work quotas became outdated. They earned piecework wages that were almost equal to 50% of their basic wages each month. At the end of June last year, the group of workers voluntarily requested the factory leadership to lower the work quotas. After the work quotas were lowered, they worked even harder. By December 29, the Xing Shouyuan group had comprehensively completed last year's production plan, fulfilling 222.8% of the output, installing an additional 3,875 double-wheel single-share plows, and saving 79 million yuan. From June to December, labor productivity increased by 51%.

Workers in many factories in Qiqihar City were deeply educated by the action of the Xing Shouyuan group. By the end of last year, many groups of workers had also voluntarily requested a reduction in work quotas. After full discussion, the Wang Shixiang group in the woodworking workshop of the Machinery and Woodware Factory unanimously agreed to reduce the work quotas for seven products. Under the leadership of the Wang Shixiang group, workers in the third and fifth groups of the factory also reduced their work quotas. Workers from the Tong Wenpu and Wang Wenqing groups in the mechanical workshop of the First Machine Tool Factory automatically reduced the work quotas for sixteen parts by 22.6%. Worker Yang Bingzhong said, "We can't just look at the immediate future. If the quotas are not advanced, we can't concentrate on our work. With advanced quotas, we have the energy to work!" When discussing the reduction of work quotas, workers in the Wang Wenqing group jointly studied ways to break through the new quotas by strengthening labor discipline, doing a good job in production preparation, and quickly engaging with work with few stoppages. Workers from the Meng Zhaolie, Yu Aiqing, Zhou Yonghua, Zhou Chengyi, and other groups in the Nenjiang Textile Factory learned from the workers of the Xing Shouyuan group and also voluntarily requested to modify the piecework rates. In addition, under the influence of the workers of the Xing Shouyuan group, some groups of workers have made considerable achievements in improving production efficiency and saving raw materials.

    邢守元小组自动降低工时定额
    齐齐哈尔市不少工人小组积极响应
    齐齐哈尔市黑龙江第一机械厂邢守元小组自动要求降低工时定额的爱国行动，已在齐齐哈尔市各工厂起了很大的影响。
    邢守元小组工人由于改进了十七种工具和操作方法，又在生产中减少了辅助时间，使生产效率大大提高。这样，原来的工时定额就显得落后了。他们每月几乎都得到等于基本工资百分之五十的计件超额工资。去年六月末，小组工人自动向厂里领导上要求降低工时定额。工时定额降低后，他们更加努力生产。到十二月二十九日，邢守元小组已全面完成了去年生产计划，产量完成百分之二百二十二点八，多安装了双轮一铧犁三千八百七十五部，节约了七千九百万元。从六月到十二月，劳动生产率提高了百分之五十一。
    齐齐哈尔市很多工厂工人从邢守元小组这一行动中受到了深刻的教育。到去年年底止，有很多小组工人也自动要求降低工时定额。机械木器厂木器车间王世祥小组经过充分讨论后，大家一致同意降低七种产品的工时定额。在王世祥小组的带动下，厂里的第三、第五等小组工人也都降低了工时定额。第一机械厂机械车间佟文普和王文清两个小组的工人，自动将十六种部件降低工时定额百分之二十二点六。工人杨炳忠说：“我们不能光看眼前哪，定额不先进干起活来精力不集中；有了先进的定额，干起活来那才有劲呢！”王文清小组工人在讨论降低工时定额时，共同研究出用加强劳动纪律、做好生产准备工作以及卡活快、少停车的办法来突破新定额。嫩江纺织厂孟昭烈、于爱清、周永华、周成义等小组工人，向邢守元小组工人学习，也自动要求修改计件单价。此外，有些小组工人在邢守元小组工人的影响下，在提高生产效率、节约原材料等方面取得了不少的成绩。
