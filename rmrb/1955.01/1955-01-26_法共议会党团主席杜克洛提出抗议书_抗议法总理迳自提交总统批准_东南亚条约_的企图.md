Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 24th. TASS reports: "L'Humanité" reports that Jacques Duclos, chairman of the French Communist Party's parliamentary group, has submitted a letter of protest to the Speaker of the French National Assembly, protesting against Mendès-France's intention to submit the so-called Southeast Asia Treaty to the President of the Republic for approval without prior discussion by the parliament.

The protest letter stated: "The Communist Party firmly protests against this unprecedented attempt to violate the sovereignty of the National Assembly and violate the spirit and provisions of the Constitution... The government is attempting to deceive the parliament and make France undertake international military obligations that could involve France in a new world war. At the same time, the terms of the agreement signed on September 8, 1954, are clearly in many respects contrary to the decisions adopted in Geneva on July 21, 1954, and approved by the National Assembly...

"We demand that the National Assembly express its opinion on this issue so as not to allow the government to violate the Constitution and push France onto a path contrary to the interests of the country. In the face of the warmongering plans pursued by the United States in Southeast Asia, the National Assembly must also defend our country so that it does not engage in gambling that will lead to huge disasters."

    法共议会党团主席杜克洛提出抗议书
    抗议法总理迳自提交总统批准“东南亚条约”的企图
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社巴黎二十四日讯：“人道报”报道：法国共产党议会党团主席雅克·杜克洛向法国国民议会主席提出抗议书，对孟戴斯—弗朗斯打算在没有事先交给议会讨论就把所谓东南亚条约提交共和国总统批准一事表示抗议。
    抗议书说：“共产党坚决抗议这种史无前例的侵犯国民议会的主权和违反宪法的精神和条文的企图……政府企图欺骗议会而使法国承担可能把法国卷入一次新的世界大战的国际军事义务。同时，一九五四年九月八日签订的协定的条款在许多方面显然是违反一九五四年七月二十一日在日内瓦通过的并且为国民议会所批准的决定的……
    “我们要求国民议会就这个问题表示意见，以便不让政府违反宪法和把法国推上同国家的利益相反的道路。在美国在东南亚实行的好战计划方面，国民议会也必须保卫我们的国家，使它不进行会导向巨大灾难的赌博。”
