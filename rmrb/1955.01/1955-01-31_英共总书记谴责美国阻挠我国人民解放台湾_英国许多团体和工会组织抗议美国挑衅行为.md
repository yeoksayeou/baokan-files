Xinhua News Agency, London, January 30th: According to TASS, the General Secretary of the British Communist Party, Harry Pollitt, published an article in the "Daily Worker" condemning the provocative attitude of the US government in obstructing the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan.

Pollitt wrote: "The British government must be compelled to take action against the American conspiracy... Eisenhower's statement this week is simply an arrogant and bellicose attitude. The Taiwan area has nothing to do with the United States."

Pollitt wrote that Eisenhower shamelessly said that Taiwan, 5,000 miles away from the United States, is necessary for American defense. The United States is less than 5,000 miles away from Britain. What would we think if American warlords suddenly decided that the Isle of Wight was necessary for American defense and decided to occupy it?

Pollitt concluded: The British government should be asked to take measures to end American interference in China's internal affairs in order to safeguard peace in the Far East.

Also reported: Many British groups and trade union organizations have also protested against the US's provocative actions in the Taiwan Island area.

The Sino-British Friendship Association, with 400,000 members, issued a statement advocating condemnation of American aggression against China.

The Shop Stewards Committee of De Havilland Aircraft Manufacturing Plant, representing 4,500 workers, passed a resolution opposing the "shameless interference" of the United States in Chinese affairs. The resolution called on the British government to condemn the United States' actions in Taiwan.

The Birmingham Trades Council Executive Committee, representing 150,000 workers, sent a telegram to the British Trades Union Congress, suggesting that the Trades Union Congress, on behalf of British trade union members, demand that the United States stop interfering in Chinese affairs.

    据新华社三十日讯：据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国共产党总书记哈里·波立特在“工人日报”发表文章，谴责美国政府阻挠中国人民解放台湾的挑衅态度。
    波立特写道：“必须迫使英国政府采取行动反对美国的阴谋……艾森豪威尔本周所发表的声明简直是一种骄横的好战态度。台湾地区同美国毫无关连。”
    波立特写道，艾森豪威尔恬不知耻地说，远离美国五千哩的台湾是美国防务所必需的。美国离英国不到五千哩，如果美国军阀忽然决定，威地岛为美国防御所必需，并且决定要占领它，那么我们会怎样想呢？
    波立特最后说：应当要求英国政府采取措施，终止美国对中国内政的干涉，以维护远东的和平。
    又讯：英国许多团体及工会组织也都抗议美国在台湾岛地区的挑衅行为。
    有四十万会员的英中友好协会发表声明，主张谴责美国对中国的侵略。
  　德哈维兰飞机制造厂车间主任委员会代表四千五百名工人通过一项决议，反对美国对中国事务的“无耻干涉”。决议中要求英国政府谴责美国对台湾的行动。
    伯明翰工会理事会执行委员会代表十五万工人致电英国职工大会，建议职工大会代表英国工会会员要求美国停止对中国事务的干涉。
