    Livestock Disease Mobile Medical Team Works in Disaster Area
    In order to do a good job in livestock protection in the disaster area during the winter, the Huaiyin Prefectural Office of Jiangsu Province has specially drawn fifteen veterinary cadres and twenty-eight traditional Chinese medicine veterinarians to form a mobile medical team for livestock epidemic diseases in the disaster area, which goes deep into the severely affected districts and townships to treat livestock diseases free of charge. In addition to allocating a large number of veterinary drugs and equipment to the disaster area, the Huaiyin Prefectural Office also allocated 42 million yuan as expenses for traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions, etc. After studying, the mobile medical team arrived in Huaiyin, Huaian, Siyang and other disaster-stricken counties on December 21, 1954. The working time is about three months. In addition to carrying out the diagnosis and treatment of sick livestock, they also publicize and guide winter livestock protection, improve feeding management, repair livestock pens, and rationally eliminate old and disabled draft cattle.

    畜病巡回医疗队到灾区工作
    江苏省淮阴专署为了做好灾区冬季护畜工作，特抽调了十五名兽医干部和二十八名中兽医，组成灾区家畜疫病巡回医疗队，深入受灾较重区乡免费治疗畜病。淮阴专署除调拨大量兽医药品器械到灾区外，并拨款四千二百万元作为中药配方等费用。巡回医疗队经过学习后，已在一九五四年十二月二十一日分别到达淮阴、淮安、泗阳等受灾县。工作时间约在三个月左右，他们除进行病畜诊疗工作外，同时还宣传、指导冬季护畜、改善饲养管理、修补畜舍及合理淘汰老残耕畜。（朱维清）
