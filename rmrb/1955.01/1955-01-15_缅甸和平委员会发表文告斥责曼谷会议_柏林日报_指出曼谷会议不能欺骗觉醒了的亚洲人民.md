Xinhua News Agency, January 14th: Rangoon News: The Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace issued a statement on January 9th, condemning the conference of Manila Treaty participating countries scheduled to be held in Bangkok on February 23rd.
	The statement said that the Bangkok conference is a conspiracy by US imperialism to further expand its military and economic power in Southeast Asia. US imperialism, taking advantage of the US-Japan "Security Treaty" and the "ROK-US Mutual Defense Treaty," has long occupied Japan and South Korea, and now attempts to use the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" as a guise to invade Southeast Asian countries. The statement said that the Bangkok conference is a concrete step taken by US imperialism in preparing for war in Southeast Asia. The people of Burma should unite with peace-loving people all over the world to stop this threatening act of aggression.
	Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 14th: The German Democratic Republic's "Berliner Zeitung" commented on the Asian-African Conference on the 13th, saying that the Asian-African Conference will be a new stage in the struggle of the Asian and African people. It will set an example for the people of Western Europe. The commentary also said that the imperialist colonial exploitation policy has been frustrated in Asia. The people of Africa are also beginning to break free from the shackles of colonial exploitation.
	The commentary said that no matter whether the United States and its vassal states hold the Bangkok conference, or use enticements and threats, they cannot deceive the people who have already awakened. The commentary said that the Asian people will not fight a war of aggression for the likes of Eisenhower or Nolan.

    缅甸和平委员会发表文告斥责曼谷会议
    “柏林日报”指出曼谷会议不能欺骗觉醒了的亚洲人民
    【新华社十四日讯】仰光消息：缅甸保卫世界和平委员会在一月九日发表文告，斥责定于二月二十三日在曼谷举行的马尼拉条约参与国会议。
    文告说，曼谷会议是美帝国主义企图在东南亚进一步扩展它的军事和经济势力的阴谋。美帝国主义利用美日“安全条约”和“韩美共同防御条约”，长期侵占日本和南朝鲜，现在又企图利用“东南亚集体防务条约”这个幌子来侵入东南亚各国。文告说，曼谷会议是美帝国主义在东南亚准备战争的具体步骤。缅甸人民应该和全世界爱好和平的人民团结起来，制止这种侵略战争的威胁行动。
    【新华社柏林十四日电】德意志民主共和国“柏林日报”十三日评论亚非会议说，亚非会议将是亚非人民斗争的一个新阶段。它将为西欧人民树立榜样。评论又说，帝国主义的殖民主义剥削政策在亚洲已经遭到了挫折。非洲人民也开始挣脱殖民主义剥削的锁链。
    评论说，不论美国和它的仆从国家举行曼谷会议也罢，利诱和威胁也罢，都不能欺骗已经觉醒了的人民。评论说，亚洲人民将不会替艾森豪威尔或诺兰之流的侵略战争打仗。
