    Why Do Medicines Have Multiple Prices?
    To the Editor:
    There are very chaotic and unreasonable phenomena in the pricing of medicines in some public and private hospitals in Beijing. The same kind of medicine has several different prices, the price differs between pharmaceutical companies and public hospitals, between public hospitals and private hospitals, and even among public hospitals themselves. For example, the same bottle of 1,000 sodium bicarbonate tablets costs 5,800 yuan (5.8 yuan per tablet) at the retail price of the China Pharmaceutical Company Beijing Branch, but 200,000 yuan (200 yuan per tablet) when sold to patients at Beijing Municipal First Hospital, 50,000 yuan (50 yuan per tablet) at Beijing Municipal Third Hospital, and 10,000 yuan (10 yuan per tablet) at the Peking Medical College Hospital. Another example: a bottle of 1,000 aspirin tablets costs 41,000 yuan (41 yuan per tablet) at the retail price of the pharmaceutical company, but 200,000 yuan (200 yuan per tablet) when sold to patients at Beijing Municipal First Hospital and Third Hospital, and 50,000 yuan (50 yuan per tablet) at the Peking Medical College Hospital. A bottle of 1,000 calcium lactate tablets costs only 20,100 yuan (a little over 20 yuan per tablet) at the retail price of the pharmaceutical company, but 200,000 yuan (200 yuan per tablet) at Beijing Municipal First Hospital, and 50,000 yuan (50 yuan per tablet) at Beijing Municipal Third Hospital and Peking Medical College Hospital.
      The medical expenses paid by a patient being treated in the above-mentioned three hospitals also vary greatly. For example, an injection of 50% glucose solution, including the injection fee, costs 7,000 yuan at Beijing Municipal First Hospital, 5,000 yuan at Beijing Municipal Third Hospital, and 4,000 yuan at Peking Medical College Hospital. An injection of ascorbic acid with the same content costs 4,000 yuan at Beijing Municipal First Hospital, 2,000 yuan at Beijing Municipal Third Hospital, and 1,000 yuan at Peking Medical College Hospital, but only 700 yuan for an injection at the pharmaceutical company's store.
    This phenomenon is even more serious in some private hospitals and clinics. Some private hospitals and clinics calculate the price of some ordinary oral medicines based on the number of days, regardless of how much you take per day and how cheap the medicine is, they charge a fixed fee. For example, some tablets are only worth a few dozen yuan each, but they charge 5,000 yuan per day's dose. Some private clinics often take advantage of people's difficulties and charge high prices. For example, an injection of sodium camphor sulfonate (a cardiac stimulant, which costs only 500 yuan per injection at the pharmaceutical company) costs 7,000 to 8,000 yuan, or even tens of thousands of yuan. This unreasonable charging situation seriously increases the burden on the broad masses of the people, and makes it impossible for a series of measures taken by the state, such as lowering drug prices, to care for the health of the people, to be reflected in the patients.
    The medicines in hospitals are mostly purchased from the China Pharmaceutical Company at wholesale prices. Why do the prices of medicines vary so unreasonably after going through the hospitals? First of all, the relevant health authorities have not stipulated the charging standards for medicines in various hospitals, or although the charging standards have been stipulated, they are only for the convenience of charging, but do not take into account the burden on patients. In June 1953, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Health Bureau stipulated: general tablets priced under 100 yuan each should be charged at 200 yuan, those under 200 yuan should be charged at 300 yuan… those priced over 500 yuan should be charged at an additional 30 percent. This regulation is not reasonable enough. Secondly, some hospitals deliberately sell medicines at higher prices in order to gain patients' trust in the medicines. The Peking Medical College Hospital sometimes sells potassium bromide solution with different contents to patients, but charges 4,000 yuan per 100 cc. This practice is also clearly inappropriate.
    It is very unreasonable for a city to have several prices for the same medicine, and the difference is very large. I believe that it is entirely possible to achieve basic uniformity in drug prices in Beijing, and I suggest that the relevant departments study and solve this problem. Lu Xiang

    为什么一种药品几样价格编辑同志：
    北京市有一些公立和私立医院在出售药品的价格上，存在着非常混乱和极不合理的现象。同样
  一种药品有好多种价钱，医药公司和公立医院不同，公立医院和私立医院也不相同，甚至同是公立医院而药价也相差很大。例如：同样的苏打片每瓶一千片，中国医药公司北京市公司的零售价是一瓶五千八百元（每片五元八），北京市立第一医院售给患者的药价却是一瓶二十万元（每片二百元），北京市立第三医院的售价是一瓶五万元（每片五十元），而北京医学院附属医院的售价每瓶一万元
  （每片十元）。又如：每瓶一千片的阿斯匹林，医药公司的零售价是一瓶四万一千元（每片四十一元），而北京市立第一医院和第三医院售给患者是一瓶二十万元（每片二百元），北京医学院附属医院的售价却是每瓶五万元（每片五十元）。每瓶一千片的乳酸钙片，医药公司的零售价仅二万零一百元（每片二十元多），而北京市立第一医院的售价是一瓶二十万元（每片二百元），北京市立第三医院和北京医学院附属医院的售价却是每片五十元，每瓶五万元。
      一个患者在上面所说的这三个医院里治疗，所付医疗费用相差也很大。如：打一支含量百分之五十的葡萄糖针，包括注射费在内，北京市立第一医院收费七千元，北京市立第三医院收费五千元，北京医学院附属医院收费四千元。打一支含量相同的抗坏血酸针，在北京市立第一医院收费四千元，北京市立第三医院收费二千元，北京医学院附属医院收费一千元，然而在医药公司门市部里买一针才七百多元。
    这种现象在一些私立医院和诊疗所中，更加严重。有些私立医院和诊疗所把一些普通的内服药按天数计算药价，不管你一天吃多少和药价如何便宜，他们都收一定的费用，如有的药片只值几十元一片，他们也按每日量五千元收费。有的私人诊疗所往往乘人之危，高价收费，如打一针樟脑磺酸钠
  （这是一种强心针，医药公司的售价仅每支五百元）就要收七、八千元，甚至收几万元。这种不合理的收费情况严重地增加了广大人民群众的负担，使得国家降低药品价格等关怀人民群众身体健康的一系列的措施不能在患病者的身上体现出来。
    医院的药品大都是按照批发价从中国医药公司买来的，为什么经过医院以后药品价格却高低不一到如此不合理的程度呢？首先是有关卫生机关没有规定各医院药品的收费标准，或者虽然规定了收费标准，只是为了收费方便，却不照顾患者的负担。在一九五三年六月，北京市人民政府公共卫生局曾经规定：一般的片剂每片不足一百元的照二百元收，不足二百元的照三百元收……每片五百元以上的加价百分之三十。这种规定是不够合理的。其次，有的医院为了骗取病人对药品的信任，有意把药卖贵一些。北京医学院附属医院售给患者的溴化钾溶液有时含量不同，却都要按每百西西收费四千元计算。这种做法也显然是不妥当的。
    在一个市区，一种药品有着几种价格，而且差数很大，是很不合理的现象。我认为北京市内的药价是完全可以作到基本上统一的，建议有关方面研究解决。　陆湘
