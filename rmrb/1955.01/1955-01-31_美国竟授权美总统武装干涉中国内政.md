Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 30th: The U.S. Senate, following the House of Representatives, passed the joint resolution of both houses on January 28th by a vote of 85 to 3, based on President Eisenhower's war message on January 24th. Thus, this proposal has become a resolution of the U.S. Congress. Eisenhower signed the resolution on January 29th. This resolution is a brutal interference in China's internal affairs, granting Eisenhower broad powers to use armed forces to interfere with the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan and Penghu and to expand aggression against China.

The Senate's discussion of this proposal took place in an atmosphere filled with war hysteria. Supporters of the proposal could not find any words to justify or whitewash this aggressive proposal. The reports submitted by the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees even openly stated that "pure legal arguments should not prevent this (U.S.) government and the United Nations from taking actions that may be necessary" to obstruct the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan.

The war-like nature of this proposal can also be seen from the reaction caused by a statement made by U.S. Secretary of Defense Wilson. In order to alleviate the concerns of some members of Congress and public opinion about the serious consequences of this bill, Wilson said on the 26th that the situation created by this bill was "just a small ripple—no need to be overly nervous." However, his remarks were immediately met with sharp criticism. Republican Congressman Short believed that Wilson's words were "inappropriately worded." He said that it was by no means a small ripple, and it could lead to a large-scale war. Wilson had to be forced to "revise" his "view."

This dangerous prospect caused some senators to constantly express serious concerns during the discussion. They were worried that the great power granted to Eisenhower might recklessly drag the United States into a war it could not win. According to the United Press, former commander-in-chief of the U.S. forces in Korea, now U.S. Army Chief of Staff Ridgway, testified at a closed-door meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees on the evening of the 25th that "winning" a foothold on the Chinese mainland would require 300,000 to 400,000 U.S. ground troops. He said he believed that fighting China would require more U.S. ground forces, but these forces were already too widely distributed, and the U.S. Army already lacked the manpower to fulfill the U.S.'s "obligations" overseas. The United Press said that some senators "became worried" after hearing Ridgway's testimony. During the debate, some senators proposed a series of amendments. Although they did not fundamentally oppose the U.S. government's aggressive policy, but only asked to slightly limit Eisenhower's war powers, they were all rejected. This result led independent Senator Morse, who voted against it, to say that he believed the proposal "greatly increased the possibility of war." Another Republican Senator Langer, who voted against it, said, "I certainly do not vote to send American children to mainland China."

Before the Senate passed the proposal, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman George, citing the fact that the United Nations Security Council would raise the Taiwan issue at its meeting on January 31, requested that the Senate pass it as soon as possible. George said that the U.S. Congress passing this proposal would put the United States in a "position of strength" in negotiations. This fact shows that the real purpose of the so-called mediation and "ceasefire" activities carried out by the U.S. aggressive bloc in the United Nations is nothing more than to steal the banner of the United Nations to facilitate its war of aggression against China.

    美国竟授权美总统武装干涉中国内政
    【新华社三十日讯】华盛顿消息：美国参议院已继众议院之后在一月二十八日以八十五票对三票通过了根据美国总统艾森豪威尔二十四日的战争咨文制订的参众两院联合提案。这样，这个提案已经成了美国国会的决议。一月二十九日，艾森豪威尔签署了这个决议。这个决议是对中国内政的横暴干涉，它授予艾森豪威尔使用武装部队干涉中国人民解放台湾和澎湖并且对中国扩大侵略的广泛权力。
    参议院对于这个提案的讨论是在充满着战争歇斯底里的空气中进行的。提案的支持者找不到任何可以为这个侵略性提案辩解与粉饰的言语，参议院外交和军事两个委员会提出的报告中甚至公然说“不应该让纯法律的论据来阻止这个（美国）政府和联合国采取可能是必要的行动”来阻挠中国人民解放台湾。
    这个提案的战争性质还可以从美国国防部长威尔逊的一次谈话所引起的反响中暴露出来。威尔逊为了缓和一些议员和公众舆论对这个议案的严重后果的顾虑，曾在二十六日把这个议案所造成的局势说成“只是一个小小的波浪——不用过份紧张”。但是，他的谈话立即受到了尖锐的批评。共和党众议员肖特认为威尔逊的话“措辞不当”。他说，它决不是一个小波浪，它可能导向一场大规模的战争。威尔逊不得不被迫“修正”了他的“看法”。
    这种危险的前景使一些参议员在讨论的过程中不断流露出严重的顾虑。他们担心授与艾森豪威尔的大权可能把美国轻率地拖入一场它无法取胜的战争。据合众社报道，前任侵朝美军总司令、现任美国陆军参谋长李奇微二十五日晚在参议院外交、军事两委员会的秘密会议上作证时说，要求在中国大陆“赢得”一个立脚点需要三十万到四十万美国地面部队。他说，他相信对中国作战需要投入更多的美国地面部队，但是这些部队现在已经是分布面太广，并且美国陆军已经缺乏人力来履行美国在海外的
  “义务”。合众社说，某些参议员听到李奇微的作证
  “忧虑起来”。在进行辩论时，一些参议员提出了一系列的修正案。虽然他们并非根本反对美国政府的侵略政策，而不过要求略微限制一下艾森豪威尔的战争权力，但是还都是被否决了。这个结果使得投了反对票的无党无派参议员莫尔斯说，他认为提案“大大增加了战争的可能性”。另一个投反对票的共和党参议员朗杰说，“我当然不投票赞成把美国孩子送到中国大陆上去。”
    在参议院通过这个提案以前，参议院外交委员会主席乔治曾以联合国安全理事会将在一月三十一日的会议上提出台湾问题为理由，要求参议院尽速予以通过。乔治说，美国国会通过这个提案会使美国在谈判中处于“实力地位”。这个事实说明了美国侵略集团在联合国内进行的所谓斡旋“停火”的活动，其真实目的不过是要盗用联合国的旗帜来便利自己进行侵略中国的战争。
