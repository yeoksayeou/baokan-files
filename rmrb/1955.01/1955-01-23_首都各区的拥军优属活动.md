　　The various districts of the capital are widely展开ing Spring Festival activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of soldiers. Many public security stations, street offices in Qianmen, Xisi, Xidan, Dongsi, Xuanwu, Haidian, Shijingshan districts, and many townships in the suburbs have successively held representative meetings or forums of families of martyrs, families of soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers to summarize the preferential treatment work of the past year and pointed out the shortcomings that must be improved in the work of 1955. On the 19th, the Dongdan District convened a meeting of more than 400 people to congratulate the families of 48 meritorious soldiers. The masses and children in various districts helped the families of martyrs and soldiers clean their courtyards. Many police stations also held army-civilian get-together meetings. Various districts also distributed material subsidies to poor families of martyrs and soldiers so that they could celebrate the Spring Festival like the masses. These facts deeply moved the families of martyrs, soldiers, and soldiers. Zhu Deqing, a soldier stationed in Qianmen District, said when talking about the care his father and brother received from the government: I will definitely ask my comrades to protect the capital and protect the people's happy life. Xu Shuqin, a representative of the family members of soldiers, said at a representative meeting convened in Qianmen District that she must work hard in the rear to support the great struggle to liberate Taiwan.

    首都各区的拥军优属活动
    首都各区广泛展开春节拥军优属活动。前门、西四、西单、东四、宣武、海淀、石景山等区许多公安派出所、街道办事处，以及郊区的许多乡，都先后召开了烈属、军属、革命残废军人、复员建设军人代表会议或座谈会，总结了一年来的优抚工作，指出了一九五五年工作中必须努力改进的缺点。东单区于十九日召集四百多人的大会，为四十八名立功军人的家属贺功。各区群众和儿童分别帮助烈属、军属打扫庭院。许多派出所还召开了军民联欢大会。各区并给贫苦的烈属和军属发了实物补助金，使他们能和群众一样欢度春节。这些事实使烈属、军属和军人深受感动。前门区驻军朱德清同志谈到他的父亲和弟弟受到政府的关怀时说：我一定叫同志们好好保卫首都，保卫人民过幸福生活。军属代表徐淑琴在前门区召集的代表会上说，她一定要努力在后方生产，支援解放台湾的伟大斗争。
