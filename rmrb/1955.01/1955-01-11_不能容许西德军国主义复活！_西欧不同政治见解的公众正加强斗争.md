West Germany
The German Communist Party has decided to hold a "Struggle Week" against the Paris Agreements in West Germany from January 10th to 20th. At the same time, the Central Committee of the German Social Democratic Party decided to launch a movement against the Paris Agreements throughout West Germany in the second half of January.

France
As the date of the French Republic's Senate debate on the Paris Agreements approaches, a mass movement of people against arming West Germany is unfolding across France. Meetings and mass rallies are being held everywhere, with appeals being sent to the members of the Republic's Senate.

The mayors of all the cities in the Saint-Livrade district (in Lot-et-Garonne) wrote a letter on behalf of Lot-et-Garonne to the members of the Republic's Senate, demanding the rejection of the Paris Agreements. The committee of this province against the revival of German militarism and for disarmament negotiations called on all mayors in the province to sign this letter. The members of this committee include municipal and provincial councilors elected from almost all parties.

The Executive Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor (CGT) also issued a statement supporting the call of the French Women's Action Committee against the revival of German militarism: to hold rallies and mass meetings in cities and towns across the country on January 30th to oppose the arming of West Germany, and to fight for the prohibition of atomic weapons and disarmament. The Executive Bureau of the French CGT called on all trade union organizations to actively participate in the preparation and implementation of these measures.

The French Veterans' Union calls on its members to participate in the resolute struggle against the ratification of the Paris Agreements.

A district party organization of the French Communist Party in Paris held a meeting of activists. François Billoux, Secretary of the French Communist Party, spoke at the meeting. Billoux said: "The experience of recent months has shown that the best way to stop the ratification of the London and Paris Agreements is to further strengthen the alliance of republican and democratic forces, and the foundation of this alliance should be the united action of the working class and the united front of socialists and communists."

Billoux pointed out that it is entirely possible for the French people to prevent West Germany from being remilitarized, safeguard the security of the motherland, and achieve the victory of the cause of peace. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to resolutely demand that the members of the Republic's Senate reject the Paris Agreements.

England
The movement protesting the London and Paris Agreements on arming West Germany is constantly expanding in the UK. Many factories across the country are actively preparing for the National Day Against West German Rearmament, scheduled for January 25th. On this day, representatives of the working people will come to London to express their disagreement with the ratification of the London and Paris Agreements to the members of the House of Commons.

The representatives of 36,000 machine manufacturing workers in North London have already passed a resolution on participating in this movement and sending representatives to parliament. Peace committees in cities such as Leeds and Sheffield, and many other organizations, as well as workers in all major enterprises in Sheffield, have passed similar resolutions. Many local trade union organizations have requested that the Labor Party conference re-examine its policy on the German question.

John Eaton, chairman of the Executive Committee of the British Peace Committee, addressed a plenary meeting of the British Peace Committee on the 9th, calling on the British people to intensify their struggle against the revival of the Nazi "Wehrmacht." He pointed out that the British people, like the French and German people, oppose the revival of German militarism.

Eaton refuted the deceptive propaganda that arming West Germany has become a foregone conclusion. He pointed out that France has not made a final decision, and West Germany has not yet agreed. West German youths are widely protesting against the remilitarization of West Germany.

Eaton emphasized the great significance of the British Peace Committee's call for everyone to send delegations on January 25th to demand that members of parliament stop arming West Germany. Eaton said: "We must mobilize all our forces to defend peace. We must never allow those leaders who do not represent the will of the people to hand over the power to decide on war and peace to Nazi generals."

The renowned British pacifist, Methodist Minister Soper, also recently published an article in the "Tribune" weekly newspaper, opposing the Paris Agreements. He wrote: "I strongly oppose the intention, openly contained in the Paris Agreements, to divide Europe into opposing camps." He pointed out: "Arming West Germany is a sinful proposition, which demands that the Cold War continue at all costs." He also wrote that ordinary people in all countries oppose arming West Germany. If the voices of ordinary people are listened to, European security is more likely to be guaranteed.

Belgium
According to "Red Flag" newspaper reports: Progressive people in Belgium are intensifying their struggle against the London and Paris Agreements.

A rally was held in Binche, Hainaut Province, on the 3rd, where Isabelle Blume, winner of the Stalin International Peace Prize, spoke. Many people who attended the rally signed a resolution protesting against the arming of West Germany.

In Saint-Vith, trade union members participating in the Belgian General Confederation of Labor (FGTB) held a meeting and unanimously passed a resolution, expressing solidarity with the struggle of West German trade union members against remilitarization. In Hepon, trade union members have asked the local trade union committee to oppose West German rearmament and to urge the leadership of the Belgian FGTB to condemn the policy of reviving German militarism.

A mass meeting was also held in Charleroi, where speakers included Lebrun, secretary of the local peace committee, and Bourban, a member of the committee, who both called for a struggle against the revival of German militarism.

Many towns in Belgium are continuing to collect signatures for resolutions against the arming of West Germany. Men and women with different political views have signed these resolutions.

Denmark
The Central Committee of the Danish Communist Party adopted a letter to the Danish people at a plenary meeting held on January 8th.

The letter to the Danish people said: While the country is preparing to celebrate the tenth anniversary of Denmark's liberation from German occupation, the government and the majority of the parliament are helping to revive German militarism. The actions of this majority are contrary to the interests of the voters. Thousands of statements, protests, and demands for holding a general referendum clearly show that the people oppose the West German remilitarization, which has serious consequences, and hope to maintain peace through consultation.

The letter to the Danish people said: Denmark has the right and the responsibility to say "no." In this way, it can not only avoid participating in the revival of German militarism, but also eliminate the threat from Germany. Denmark's "no" supports the desire of West German workers to prevent German militarism from regaining power.

The letter to the Danish people concluded: While there is still time, it is necessary to demand that all members of parliament respect the opinions of the voters. Denmark's answer must be decided by a general referendum. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    不能容许西德军国主义复活！
    ——西欧不同政治见解的公众正加强斗争
    西　德
    德国共产党决定从一月十日到二十日在西德举行反对巴黎协定的“斗争周”。同时，德国社会民主党中央委员会决定在一月下半月在西德全境展开反对巴黎协定的运动。
    法　国
    随着法国共和国参议院辩论巴黎协定日期的接近，法国全国展开了反对武装西德的人民群众运动。到处在举行集会和群众大会，会上纷纷发出给共和国参议院议员的呼吁书。
    圣利佛拉德区（在罗特—加隆省）的所有城市的市长代表罗特—加隆省向共和国参议院议员写了一封信，要求拒绝巴黎协定。这个省的反对复活德国军国主义和争取举行裁减军备谈判委员会号召省内的所有的市长都在这封信上签名。这一个委员会的成员几乎包括了各个党派选出来的市议会议员和省议会议员。
    法国总工会执行局也发表声明，支持法国妇女反对复活德国军国主义行动委员会的号召：一月三十日在全国各大小城市举行集会和群众大会来反对武装西德、争取禁止原子武器和裁减军备。法国总工会执行局号召各个工会组织积极参加准备和执行这些措施。
    法兰西退伍军人联盟号召自己的会员参加反对批准巴黎协定的坚决斗争。
    法国共产党巴黎一个区的党组织举行了积极分子大会。法国共产党书记弗朗索瓦·皮佑在会上讲了话。皮佑说：“最近几月来的经验证明，制止批准伦敦和巴黎协定的最好办法就是更加加强共和力量和民主力量的联盟，这一联盟的基础应该是工人阶级的一致行动，是社会党人和共产党人的统一战线”。
    皮佑指出，法国人民完全有可能不让西德重新军国主义化，保障祖国的安全和取得和平事业的胜利。要达到这一目的，必须坚决要求共和国参议院议员拒绝巴黎协定。
    英　国
    抗议关于武装西德的伦敦和巴黎协定的运动正在英国不断扩大中。全国各地的许多工厂在为定于一月二十五日举行的全国反对西德重新武装日进行积极的准备工作。在这一天，劳动人民的代表将来到伦敦，向下院议员们表示他们不同意批准伦敦和巴黎协定的态度。
    北伦敦三万六千个机器制造工人的代表，已经通过了关于参加这个运动以及派遣代表到议会去的决议。里子、设菲尔德等城市的和平委员会和许多其他组织，以及设菲尔德所有大企业的工人都通过了类似的决议。许多地方工会组织要求召开工党会议重新审查对德国问题的政策。
    英国和平委员会执行委员会主席夏菲尔九日在英国和平委员会全体会议上致词，号召英国人民加紧斗争，反对复活纳粹“国防军”。他指出：英国人民同法国人民和德国人民一样，反对复活德国军国主义。
    夏菲尔驳斥所谓武装西德已经成为定局的欺骗宣传。他指出：法国还没有作出最后的决定，西德也还没有同意。西德的青年们正在广泛抗议西德重新军国主义化。
    夏菲尔强调英国和平委员会号召大家在一月二十五日派遣代表团要求议员们制止武装西德这件事的重大意义。夏菲尔说：“必须动员我们的一切力量来保卫和平。绝不容许那些不代表人民意志的领导人物把决定战争和和平的权力交给纳粹将军。”
    英国著名的和平人士、英国卫理公会牧师索佩尔不久以前也在“论坛”周报发表文章，反对巴黎协定。他写道：“我竭力反对巴黎协定中所公然包藏的把欧洲分裂成对立阵营的意图。”他指出：“武装西德是一种罪恶的主张，它要求冷战不顾一切地继续下去。”他又写道，各国的普通人都反对武装西德。如果倾听普通人们的呼声，欧洲安全就更有可能得到保障。
    比利时
    据“红旗报”报道：比利时的进步社会人士正在加紧进行反对伦敦和巴黎协定的斗争。
    海诺省本歇城三日举行了一次集会，斯大林国际和平奖金得奖人伊莎贝丽·布伦姆在会上讲话。参加集会的许多人在抗议武装西德的决议上签了名。
    在圣维特城，参加比利时总工会的工会会员们举行了一次会议，并且一致通过决议，声援西德工会会员们反对重新军国主义化的斗争。在海庞城，工会会员们已经要求当地工会委员会反对西德重新武装并且促使比利时总工会的领导机构斥责复活德国军国主义的政策。
    在沙勒尔瓦也举行了大会，在大会上发表演说的有当地和平委员会书记勒布朗、委员会委员布尔巴等人，他们都号召进行反对复活德国军国主义的斗争。
    比利时的许多城镇在继续为反对武装西德的决议征集签名。有着不同政治见解的男女在这些决议上签了名。
    丹　麦
    丹麦共产党中央委员会在一月八日举行的全体会议上通过了告丹麦人民书。
    告丹麦人民书说：当全国正在准备庆祝丹麦从德国占领下解放十周年的时候，政府和下议院的多数却在帮助复活德国军国主义。这个多数的行动是违反选民的利益的。数以千计的声明、抗议和举行普遍的公民投票的要求清楚地说明：人民反对有着严重后果的西德重新军国主义化，希望通过协商维护和平。
    告丹麦人民书说：丹麦有权而且有责任说“不”。这样，它不仅可以避免参加复活德国军国主义，而且还可以消除来自德国的威胁。丹麦说“不”，就支持了西德工人防止德国军国主义重掌大权的愿望。
    告丹麦人民书最后说：趁现在还来得及，必须要求所有的议员们尊重选民的意见。丹麦的回答必须由普遍的公民投票来决定。　（据新华社讯）
