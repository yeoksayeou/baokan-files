The China Welfare Institute Children's Palace, district youth centers, children's recreation rooms, children's libraries, and many schools, in addition to carrying out regular activities during the winter vacation, have also prepared various interesting new programs for the children.

Around the Spring Festival, Shanghai children will widely participate in visits and tours, have get-togethers with the People's Liberation Army, visit the families of revolutionary soldiers and revolutionary martyrs, and hold poetry recitations and story-telling sessions.
