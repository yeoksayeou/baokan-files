Preliminary Success in Growing Kelp on Reefs

The State-owned Shandong Aquatic Products Farm has achieved preliminary success in cultivating kelp on reefs above the high tide line (reefs exposed above the water during low tide).

Based on several years of experience in kelp cultivation, technicians and workers at the Shandong Aquatic Products Farm, in October of last year, enclosed approximately twelve *mu* of reefs above the high tide line in Qingdao's coastal waters into two water bays and planted kelp. During the recent spring tides, they inspected the kelp's development in the bays and discovered that most of the planted kelp had grown. The initial plan is to produce 40,000 *jin* of fresh kelp in these two bays this year.

Currently, the Shandong Aquatic Products Farm is conducting surveying work along the coast near Qingdao. It is estimated that once this method of kelp cultivation using water bays is fully successful, more than 100 *mu* of barren reefs above the high tide line along the coast near Qingdao can be used for kelp cultivation.

    岩礁上试种海带初步成功
    国营山东水产养殖场，利用干潮线以上的岩礁（落潮时露出水面的岩礁）试种海带，已获得初步成绩。
    山东水产养殖场的技术人员和工人，根据几年来种植海带的经验，在去年十月份，把青岛前海约有十二市亩干潮线以上的岩礁拦成两个水湾，种上了海带。最近落大潮时，他们把水湾里海带发育的情形作了检查，发现种上的海带大部分都生长出来了。初步计划今年在这两个水湾要生产鲜海带四万斤。
    最近山东水产养殖场正在青岛附近沿海进行测量工作，据估计：这种拦水湾养殖海带的方法完全试验成功以后，青岛附近沿海干潮线以上的荒脊岩礁，将有一百多市亩以上的面积可以用来种植海带。
