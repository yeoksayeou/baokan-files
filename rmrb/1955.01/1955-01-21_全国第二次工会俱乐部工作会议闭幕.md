    The Second National Trade Union Club Work Conference, convened by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in Beijing from January 6th to 18th, has concluded. The conference determined the current guiding principles for trade union club work and resolved related issues such as the leadership and management of trade union clubs.

    The conference pointed out that there are currently more than 12,370 trade union clubs nationwide, an increase of more than fourteen times compared to 1950, and there have been many improvements in the work of trade union clubs. However, some trade union workers still lack sufficient understanding of the guiding principles and significance of trade union club work, and there are still certain shortcomings in the work of some trade union clubs, such as blindness, pursuit of formalism, and impracticality. The conference believes that the basic guiding principle of trade union club work is: to face the grassroots, serve production, and serve the masses. Based on the current specific situation, the conference determined that the current working principle of trade union clubs is to continue rectification, enrich the content of activities, improve the quality of work, and focus on the grassroots to achieve steady development. The conference pointed out that the activities of trade union clubs are multifaceted, including holding reports and exhibitions on political, current affairs, and technical aspects; it is also absolutely impossible to relax the organization of recreational, sports, and cultural activities for workers and should pay close attention to improving the ideological content of these activities. The work of trade union clubs should start from the actual needs of production and the masses of workers, and the activities held should be mainly popular; they should actively cooperate with the administrative departments of factories and mines; and should attract more workers to participate in activities on a voluntary basis.

    The conference also studied the issues of leadership and management of trade union clubs, believing that trade union clubs must strengthen democratic management and planned management in the future to regularize activities; attention should be paid to uniting and helping activists, and the work should always be placed under the supervision of the masses. The conference also determined that trade union clubs should be under the unified leadership of the trade union committee, and its routine work should be managed by the trade union propaganda department; trade union clubs in cities and districts can provide business guidance to grassroots trade union clubs.

    The conference also discussed the regulations related to the work of trade union clubs and exchanged work experiences.
