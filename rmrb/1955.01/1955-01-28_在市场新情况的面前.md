    Facing New Market Conditions
    By our correspondent Gu Weijin
    With the expansion of planned procurement, planned supply, processing orders, unified purchase, and exclusive sales, state-owned commercial departments in Hubei Province have grasped all or most of the main commodities related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. The economic life of the people in Hubei Province, especially the broad masses of peasants, is more closely connected with state-owned commerce. Particularly after the non-disaster-stricken peasants reaped a bumper harvest last year, and the disaster-stricken peasants received large amounts of relief funds and loans from the government, they are even more eager for state-owned commercial departments to supply them with a large amount of means of livelihood and means of production. Department stores in cities and towns such as Shayang, Suixian, Badong, Laohekou, and Xishui have felt that more than 100 kinds of commodities need to have their purchase plans increased. State-owned shops in counties such as Xiaogan, Jianli, and Xianning have also felt that the purchase plans need to be increased by five to twelve times to meet the purchasing needs of the peasants. However, facing these new market conditions, some state-owned commercial departments have not done a good job in supply work.
    Since October of last year, commodity shortages have become common in many small and medium-sized cities and market towns in Hubei Province. The commodities that are out of stock include: sugar, edible oil, cooked food, pork, cotton wadding, sanitary clothing, enameled washbasins with colored flowers, towels, socks, bamboo-shell thermos bottles, cigarettes, matches, etc. However, while commodities are out of stock in the market, the state-owned commercial sector in the province only completed 78.93% of its sales plan in October. Among them, sugar only completed 78% of the plan, edible oil only completed 55.37% of the plan, and cigarettes only completed 37.51% of the plan. The sales plan of supply and marketing cooperatives was even worse than that of state-owned commerce.
    What does it mean when there are commodity shortages on the one hand and failure to complete the sales plan on the other? It can only mean that there are shortcomings and errors in the subjective work of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce departments.
    Many staff members of the current commercial system have a wrong understanding. They say: "The current period is a period of supply falling short of demand. The less we sell, the better. It doesn't matter if we don't complete the plan." Some even say: "It is glorious to have supply falling short of demand and to be out of stock." Under this wrong understanding, they not only do not actively try to improve supply work and meet the needs of the people in various ways, but also make arbitrary regulations and even violate laws and discipline, artificially creating many inconveniences for consumers. This is prominently manifested in the following aspects:
    For planned supply materials, "reserving flexibility" at each level, deducting supply quotas. The grain supply plan for Echeng County in October of last year was originally 930,000 jin. In order to "have flexibility," the county grain bureau deducted 180,000 jin and only allocated 750,000 jin to the Echeng County State-owned Grain Store. When the grain store supplied to the lower levels, it also withheld 100,000 jin for "flexibility." By the time it was supplied to the townships, it had been discounted many times and the amount was not much. The winter cotton wadding supply quota for Macheng County was 166,000 jin, but the county textile store only gave 120,000 jin to the district cooperatives. In order to "save for later," the district cooperatives only sold 18,000 jin by November. The edible oil purchasing station in Hong'an County allocated an edible oil supply quota of 3.6 liang per person per month to the district supply and marketing cooperative. When the district cooperative supplied to the township government, it deducted 1 liang per person. When the township government supplied to the masses, it deducted another 1 liang per person. By the time the edible oil was supplied to the masses, only 1.6 liang per person per month remained.
    In order to "sell less," state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce departments in various places also deliberately create trouble for consumers and even come up with many methods to restrict purchases. In Xianning County, some cooperatives stipulate that cloth for weddings must be purchased within seven days from the date of the certificate from the district government; cloth for childbirth can only be purchased with a doctor's certificate. The Songbu Town textile store in Macheng County stipulates that cotton wadding must be bundled with cool fans. The Puqi County Cooperative stipulates that one bottle of brandy must be bundled with one jin of sugar; half a jin of stinky dried fish must be bundled with one jin of pork... The peasants said dissatisfiedly: "You (referring to state-owned shops and cooperatives) deduct what we want, and you won't sell more; you force people to buy what we don't want. What kind of planned supply and what kind of socialist superiority is this?" In some areas, because the peasants were dissatisfied with the edible oil supply (they could only get one or two liang of edible oil per person per month), they brought sprayers to buy edible oil, saying: "The government calls for thrift, so we buy it back and spray it to eat."
    Also, many places stipulate that you must stand in line to buy things. Of course, in certain situations, it is necessary to stand in line to buy things. However, some things do not necessarily have to be bought in line. For example, the peasants know that the supply of sugar is insufficient in some places. Therefore, they suggested to department stores and cooperatives: "Insufficient supply can be allocated reasonably: first supply pregnant women, patients, children, and sweet food vendors, and then supply ordinary people if there is a surplus. If there is no surplus, then don't supply." This suggestion is very good. Implementing it can achieve reasonable supply and avoid queuing. However, department stores and cooperatives did not adopt this suggestion. For the convenience of their own business, they still let the peasants stand in line to buy. They did not take the peasants' queuing as a serious matter, just as the director of the Longwu District Cooperative in Xiangyang County said: "What is queuing? Going to the market and climbing the mountains is always a day." Even as the director of the Yushan District Cooperative in Macheng County said: "Not standing in line to buy things means that socialist consciousness is not high." Since they have such an understanding of queuing, it is no wonder that some state-owned grain stores in some places even made the peasants stand in line for three days and three nights when supplying seeds, so that some people were hungry and dizzy. Someone said that the peasants were made to stand in line because "there are few people, they can't take care of it, there is no way." This may be true. However, if the staff of these commercial departments can consider that the peasants' queuing time is too long, which will waste production time and increase physical fatigue - if they have a little bit of mass viewpoint, why can't they make full use of the strength of private merchants to appropriately increase some supply points or add some business personnel?
    State-owned commerce and cooperative commerce departments have not only failed to do a good job in supplying planned supply materials, but also have not done a good job in supplying non-planned supply materials. Judging from the inventory of state-owned commerce in the province, socks, towels, bamboo-shell thermos bottles, soap, salt, and fungus are sufficient for supply and should not be out of stock. However, these materials are also out of stock in counties such as Zhongxiang, Yingshan, Echeng, and Xishui.
    If the supply of materials is not done well, the peasants will naturally have opinions. Some state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce departments use the "supply falling short of demand" as an excuse to cover up the shortcomings of their work and talk to the peasants about the principle of supply and demand. Of course, it is right to let the peasants understand the principle of supply and demand, and the principle of supply and demand should be used to explain the fact that the supply of some consumer goods falls short of demand. However, the insufficient supply of some consumer goods cannot be explained solely by the principle of supply and demand. Because today, some peasants' demands for certain commodities are not already exceeding the planned supply quotas, resulting in demand exceeding supply and creating a contradiction between supply and demand, but because there are errors in the supply work such as conservative reluctance to sell and deduction of supply quotas at various levels, so that the peasants cannot get the share they should get according to the planned supply quotas. Under this circumstance, it is of course impossible to convince the peasants to continue to talk to the peasants about the contradiction between supply and demand. For example, when the Xiaogan County Oil Purchasing Station supplied kerosene, the monthly supply plan was not completed due to the deduction of supply quotas at various levels (for example, in November of last year, the original plan was to supply 61,000 jin of kerosene, but only 21,000 jin were supplied), which affected some peasants' use of kerosene lamps. The peasants asked the salespersons why the supply of kerosene is so small now? The salesperson said: "There are two reasons: 1. Support the disaster areas; 2. There are more households using kerosene lamps." The peasants said: "There is no objection to supporting the disaster areas, but why haven't there been more kerosene lamps in our village?" The salesperson couldn't answer this question, so he began to tell the peasants about the principle of supply and demand. The peasants said dissatisfiedly: "Regardless of the contradiction, anyway, there are not as many kerosene lamps in our village as there were last year."
    Due to the lack of propaganda and explanation work, coupled with serious errors in the supply work itself, the peasants do not understand the supply situation; and they have a tense mentality. Some peasants buy goods when they see them. In Heping Township, Anlu County, some people who are not yet fifty years old also bought coffins, and a lonely old woman bought seventy boxes of matches at a time, enough to use for five years. An old woman in Chengguan, Echeng County, had financial difficulties, and the government gave her a sum of relief money. She saw that some consumer goods were not easy to buy in the market, and she was afraid that she would not be able to buy salt in the future, so she bought most of the relief money for salt, which was enough for her to eat for at least one or two years. Speculators also took advantage of the artificially created tense opportunity to engage in speculation.
    The emergence of this phenomenon is not accidental. For a long time, the leaders of the state-owned commercial system have paid insufficient attention to strengthening political and ideological education for cadres. Some leading cadres simply engage in business and do not care much about politics. Some even believe that "as long as the profits are turned over, politics doesn't matter." Therefore, they mainly use "completing the profits to be turned over" to measure work achievements, and do not link "completing the profits to be turned over" with "organizing production, ensuring supply, and close the relationship between the Party and the peasants" to measure work achievements. When the market undergoes fundamental changes, they have not educated the cadres in time to recognize this new situation and the responsibilities they should bear for the market, which has made it impossible for the cadres' management and ideological level to be improved as it should be, so as to catch up with the requirements of the development of the objective situation.
    Of course, the failure to do a good job in the supply of materials is closely related to the lack of attention to commercial work by the local Party committees. Some local Party committees mistakenly believe that commercial work is simply buying and selling, and that whether the work is good or bad is "irrelevant to the overall situation," and even look down on commercial work very much. In August of last year, after a county head returned from attending the financial and economic conference in the province, he proposed to the county party committee to study financial and economic work. The person in charge of the county party committee said impatiently: "Why bother!" During spring plowing production this year, a district chief in Huanggang County went to the cooperative to check the supply of soybean cakes, and the district party committee criticized him, saying: "事務主义, Don't care about big things, care about small things." Because some local Party committees do not pay enough attention to commercial work, commercial work is rarely discussed on the Party's agenda; even if it is discussed, it is a matter of "meeting head and tail" (that is: mentioning it incidentally at the beginning and end of the meeting, without solving the problem). In some areas, although the county head and district chief are nominally responsible for commercial work, they are actually often busy with other "central" work and leave commercial work to general cadres, but some of them cannot correctly implement commercial policies due to ideological limitations.
    Now, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has already and will continue to convene a series of financial and economic work conferences, vigorously correct the shortcomings and errors in the rural material supply work, and will comprehensively strengthen the leadership of commercial work.

    在市场新情况的面前
    本报记者　古维进
    湖北省的国营商业部门，随着计划收购、计划供应，和加工订货、统购、包销范围的扩大，已经掌握了有关国计民生的主要商品的全部或大部。湖北省的人民尤其是广大农民的经济生活和国营商业的联系更加密切了，特别是去年非灾区农民得到丰收，灾区农民得到政府的大批救济款和贷款以后，更加迫切地要求国营商业部门供应给他们大量的生活资料和生产资料。沙洋、随县、巴东、老河口、浠水等城镇的百货公司曾经感到有一百多种商品需要追加进货计划；孝感、监利、咸宁等县国营商店也感到进货计划要追加五倍至十二倍才能满足农民的购买需要。但是，在市场这种新情况的面前，有些国营商业部门并没有把供应工作做好。
    去年十月份以来，湖北省很多中小城市和集镇普遍发生商品脱销现象。脱销的商品有：食糖、食油、熟食、猪肉、絮棉、卫生衣、彩花搪瓷脸盆、毛巾、袜子、竹壳水瓶、纸烟、火柴等等。但在市场商品脱销的同时，全省国营商业十月份的销货计划只完成百分之七十八点九三。其中食糖只完成计划百分之七十八，食油只完成计划百分之五十五点三七，纸烟只完成计划百分之三十七点五一。供销合作社的销售计划比国营商业的执行情况还要坏些。
    一面是商品脱销、一面是没有完成销售计划，说明什么问题呢？只能说明国营商业和合作社商业部门在主观工作方面有缺点和错误。
    当前商业系统的许多工作人员存在着一种错误的认识，他们说：“目前是供不应求时期，越少卖越好，完不成计划也不要紧”，甚至有人说：“供不应求、脱销光荣。”在这种错误认识之下，他们不但不去积极努力改进供应工作，从多方面去满足人民的需要，反而乱定规章，甚至违法乱纪，人为地给消费者造成许多不便。这突出地表现在以下几方面：
    对于计划供应的物资，层层“留机动”，克扣供应指标。鄂城县去年十月份的粮食供应计划原是九十三万斤、县粮食局为了“机动”，就克扣了十八万斤，只拨给鄂城县国营粮食商店七十五万斤，粮店向下边供应时又扣留了十万斤作“机动”，等供应到乡，已打了许多折扣而为数不多了。麻城县冬季絮棉供应指标是十六万六千斤，可是县花纱布商店只给区合作社十二万斤，区合作社为了“留后手”，到十一月份才卖了一万八千斤。红安县油脂收购站分配给区供销合作社的食油供应指标是每人每月三两六钱，区合作社向乡政府供应时每人克扣一两，乡政府向群众供应时每人又克扣一两，等食油供应给群众时每人每月只剩下一两六钱了。
    为了“越少卖越好”，各地国营商业和合作社商业部门还故意给消费者找麻烦，甚至，想出很多限制购买的办法。在咸宁县，有的合作社规定结婚用布，要从区政府给证明信之日起限七天内买完；生娃娃用布要医生证明才能购买。麻城县宋埠镇花纱布商店规定买絮棉，要搭凉扇。蒲圻县合作社规定买一斤食糖搭一瓶白兰地酒；买一斤猪肉搭半斤臭干鱼……。农民不满意地说：“我们要的东西，你们（指国营商店和合作社）扣死，多一点不卖；我们不要的东西，你们硬要人买，这是什么计划供应，什么社会主义优越性呢？”有的地区，农民由于对食油供应不满（他们每人每月只能得到一、二两食油），带着喷雾器去买食油，说：“政府号召节约，买回去喷打着吃。”
    还有，许多地方规定买东西必须站队。当然，在一定情况下，站队买东西是必要的，但是，有些东西也不一定非站队买不可。比如有些地方食糖供应不足，农民是知道的，因此他们向百货商店和合作社建议：“不足供应可以合理分配：先供应产妇、病人、小孩、和甜食商贩，有多余的再供应一般的人。如果没有多余的就不供应。”这个建议是很好的，实行起来可以作到合理供应，也可以避免站队。但是，百货商店和合作社没有采纳这个建议，他们为了自己业务上的方便，还是让农民站队去买。他们并没有把农民站队当作一回事情，正像襄阳县龙五区合作社主任说的：“站队算什么，赶集上山，总是一天。”甚至像麻城县鱼山区合作社主任说的：“不站队买东西，就是社会主义觉悟不高。”他们既然对站队是这样认识，就无怪有些地方的国营粮食商店供应种籽时，竟让农民站队三天三夜，以致有的人站得肚饿头晕。有人说，让农民站队是因为“人员少，顾不来，没办法”。这可能是事实。但是，假如这些商业部门的工作人员能够考虑到农民站队的时间过长，要浪费生产时间和增加身体的疲劳——稍微有点群众观点的话，为什么不可以充分利用私商的力量适当增加一些供应点或是增添一些营业人员呢。
    国营商业和合作社商业部门不仅对于计划供应的物资没有做好供应工作，就是对于不是计划供应的物资也没有做好供应工作。从全省国营商业的物资库存情况来看，袜子、毛巾、竹壳热水瓶、肥皂、食盐、木耳等是足够供应的，不应该脱销的，但是，在锺祥、英山、鄂城、浠水等县这些物资也脱销了。
    做不好物资供应工作，农民自然就有意见，有些国营商业和合作社商业部门就拿“供不应求”作借口来掩盖自己工作的缺点，向农民大讲供求矛盾的道理。当然，让农民了解供求矛盾的道理是应该的，而且有些消费品供不应求是应该用供求矛盾的道理去解释的。但是，也有些消费品供应不足是不能单纯用供求矛盾的道理去解释的。因为今天有些农民对某些商品要求不是已经超过了计划供应指标，以致求多于供，产生供求矛盾，而是因为供应工作中存在保守惜售、层层克扣供应指标等错误，使农民不能按照计划供应的指标得到应该得到的份额。在这种情形下，仍然向农民大讲供求矛盾，当然是不能说服农民的。例如，孝感县油脂收购站供应煤油时，由于层层克扣供应指标，每月的供应计划都未完成（如去年十一月份原计划供应煤油六万一千斤，只供应了二万一千斤），有些农民点煤油灯便受到了影响。农民问营业员为什么现在煤油供应这样少？营业员说：“有两个道理：一、支援灾区；二、点煤油灯的户多了。”农民说：“支援灾区没有意见，但是，为什么我们村里点煤油灯的就没有多呢？”营业员没法回答这个问题，就向农民讲起供求矛盾的道理来了。农民不满地说：“不管矛盾不矛盾，反正我们村里点煤油灯的没有去年那样多了。”
    由于宣传解释工作做得不够，再加上供应工作本身有严重错误，就造成了农民对于物资供应情况不摸底；产生了紧张心理，有些农民见货就买。在安陆县和平乡里，有些不到五十岁的人也买了棺材，一个孤婆婆一次买火柴七十匣，够用五年的。鄂城县城关有个老婆婆生活困难，政府救济她一笔款。她看见市场上有些消费品不容易买到，害怕将来食盐也买不到，把大部分的救济款买了食盐，这些食盐至少够她吃一、二年。投机奸商也就趁着人为的紧张机会，进行投机捣把。
    这种现象的产生不是偶然的。长期以来，国营商业系统的领导上十分忽视对干部加强政治思想教育工作，有些领导干部单纯搞业务不大关心政治，甚至有的人认为“只要完成上缴利润就得，政治不政治没有关系。”于是他们主要以“完成上缴利润”来衡量工作成就，不是把“完成上缴利润”和“组织生产，保证供应，密切党和农民的关系”联系起来去衡量工作成就。当市场发生根本变化的时候，他们也没有及时教育干部认清这一新的形势和对市场应负的责任，这就使得干部的经营思想水平不能得到应有的提高，去赶上客观形势发展的要求。
    当然，物资供应工作没有做好，和地方党委对商业工作重视不够有很大关系。有些地方党委错误地认为商业工作是单纯做买卖，工作好坏“无关大势”，甚至对商业工作非常轻视。去年八月间，有个县长在省里开完财经会议回去以后，向县委提出研究财经工作，县委负责人不耐烦地说：“何必多此一举！”今年春耕生产时，黄冈县有个区长到合作社检查豆饼供应情况，区委批评说：“事务主义，不管大事，管小事。”由于有些地方党委对于商业工作不够重视，在党的议事日程上很少讨论商业工作；即使讨论，也是“会头会尾”的事情（即：开会附带提一提，会末附带提一提，不解决问题）。有些地区，虽然名义上是县长、区长负责管商业工作，但实际上经常忙于其他“中心”工作，把商业工作交给一般干部去管，可是他们中间有些人因受到思想水平的限制，不能正确地贯彻商业政策。
    现在，中国共产党湖北省委员会已经并且还要继续召开一系列的财经工作会议，大力纠正农村物资供应工作中的缺点和错误，并将全面加强对商业工作的领导。
