Guangdong Province is supplying a large quantity of vegetables to major cities across the country. From June to the end of last year, statistics show that over 12 million jin of vegetables were supplied to cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Changsha.

Last autumn, the Jianghuai region suffered from flooding, causing difficulties in vegetable supply for cities like Shanghai, Hankou, and Changsha. To support the vegetable needs of the people in these cities, the Guangzhou Native Produce Company made every effort to expand the business of transporting vegetables northward. From June to August, the supply of vegetables such as winter melon, taro, lotus root, and cauliflower to the above-mentioned cities amounted to more than 7 million jin.

Guangdong has a warm climate, a large area under vegetable cultivation, and a wide variety of crops, many of which are produced year-round. For example, tomatoes are still being supplied in large quantities to cities such as Beijing, Shenyang, and Tianjin.

    广东蔬菜大量供应各城市
    广东省以大量蔬菜供应全国各大城市。从去年六月到年底统计，供应北京、天津、沈阳、上海、武汉、长沙等城市的蔬菜达一千二百万斤以上。
    去年秋季江淮地区发生水灾，上海、汉口、长沙等城市蔬菜供应发生困难。广州市土产公司为了支援以上城市人民的蔬食需要，尽力扩大北运蔬菜的业务。从六月到八月，供应以上城市的冬瓜、芋头、莲藕、菜花等蔬菜就有七百多万斤。
    广东气候暖和，蔬菜的栽培面积大、品种多，其中有许多品种终年都有生产，如番茄现在仍大量的供应北京、沈阳、天津等城市。
