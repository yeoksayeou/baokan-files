Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 12th: The French National Assembly held its first meeting of the year on the 11th to elect the President of the National Assembly for 1955.

This year, the election struggle for the President of the National Assembly is particularly fierce and of great political significance, because all parliamentary groups and the broad public will first of all measure the candidates based on their attitude towards the arming of West Germany.

The meeting was presided over by the oldest member, the prominent leader of the French Communist Party, 86-year-old Cachin. Cachin announced the opening of the 1955 parliamentary session. He reminded the members that it was the ninth time he had announced the opening of the French parliamentary session each year as the oldest member.

Cachin expressed his respect for the efforts made by all the French people in producing material wealth; he said, however, that the material suffering suffered by the French working people, who are struggling to safeguard their rights, has greatly increased in the past year. Members have a responsibility to consider the needs of the working people and to strive for a rapid change in the current situation. We must not ignore all these calls urging the representatives of the legislature to implement rapid and profound changes.

Cachin continued, the most urgent demand of all ordinary men and women in France is the demand for peace, which has been increasingly threatened in recent weeks.

Cachin drew the Assembly's attention to many calls for negotiations with the Soviet Union and emphasizing the possibility of co-existence between different social systems, including calls from an authority like Herriot. He went on to say, as for us, we sincerely welcome these calls for easing international tensions. We agree with the remarks made here about history, truth and reason, and the interests of France.

Cachin said that the French people will never allow the revival of German militarism and they will continue to fight for peace.

The last part of Cachin's speech addressed the colonial question at the present stage. He pointed out the awakening of the people in the colonial countries who are fighting for their liberation. The French people will understand this trend of liberation, because they never shun new ideas, they know that progress is a constantly working factor, and that everything is subject to change and development.

Voting began after Cachin's speech.

According to the election rules, voting can be carried out three times. In the first and second rounds of voting, candidates must obtain an absolute majority to be elected. If the first two rounds of voting fail to produce a decision, a third round of voting will be held, with a simple majority vote passing the decision.

The result of the vote was that none of the candidates obtained an absolute majority in the first two rounds. In the third round of voting, Pierre Schneiter, the candidate of the Popular Republican Movement who abstained from the vote on the Paris Accords in the National Assembly, was elected. He received 232 votes, 82 votes short of half of all members.

    法国国民议会举行今年第一次会议
    法共议员加香号召反对复活德国军国主义
     【新华社十二日讯】巴黎消息：法国国民议会十一日举行今年的第一次会议，选举一九五五年的国民议会议长。
    今年，国民议会议长竞选斗争特别激烈，而且具有重大的政治意义，因为各议会党团和广大的公众首先要根据候选人对武装西德所持的态度来衡量他们。
    这次会议由最年长的议员，八十六岁的法国共产党著名领袖加香担任主席。加香宣布了一九五五年的议会会议开幕。他提醒议员们说，他作为年纪最大的议员来宣布法国议会每年会议的开幕，这已是第九次了。
    加香对全体法国人民在生产物质价值方面所作的努力表示敬意；他说，但是，在过去一年中，正在为保障自己的权利而斗争的法国劳动人民所遭受的物质上的困苦大大地增加了。议员有责任考虑劳动人民的需要，并为迅速改变现况而奋斗。我们一定不能不理会这一切要求立法机关的代表们实行迅速的、深刻的改变的呼声。
    加香接着说，法国一切普通男女的最迫切的要求就是和平的要求，在最近几个星期中，和平受到了日益严重的威胁。
    加香提请议会注意许多要求同苏联谈判并且强调不同社会制度共处的可能性的呼声，其中包括像赫里欧这样一个权威人士的呼声。他接着说，至于我们，我们非常诚恳地欢迎这些要求缓和国际紧张局势的呼声。我们同意在这里提到的历史、真理和理性以及法国利益的言论。
    加香说，法国人民绝不会容许复活德国军国主义，他们将继续为和平而斗争。
    加香的发言的最后一部分谈到了现阶段的殖民地问题。他指出了正在为他们的解放而奋斗的殖民地国家的人民的觉醒。法国人民将会理解到这种解放的倾向，因为他们从来不规避新的思想，他们知道进步是一个经常起作用的因素，每一件事物都是要改变和发展的。
    在加香的发言结束后就开始投票。
    根据选举规则，投票可以进行三次。在第一、二次投票中，候选人必须得到绝对多数票才能当选。如果头两次投票不能作出决定，就举行第三次投票，第三次投票以简单多数通过。
    投票结果，头两次投票各候选人都没有得到绝对多数票。第三次投票结果，人民共和党的候选人、在国民议会表决巴黎协定时弃权的比埃尔·施奈特当选。他获得二百三十二票，距离全体议员的半数还差八十二票。
