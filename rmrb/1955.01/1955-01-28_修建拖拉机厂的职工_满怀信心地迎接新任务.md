The workers constructing China's first tractor manufacturing plant are greeting the New Year with boundless excitement. Recently, colorful signs have been erected on street corners within the factory area, and the sounds of gongs and drums, and singing can be heard in every corner. Before the Spring Festival, workers discussed the tractor plant's construction projects for 1955, and unanimously expressed their full confidence in completing this year's construction plans, which include more than twice the amount of dormitory construction and some factory building construction compared to last year. They also examined feelings of pride and complacency and the shortcomings of last year's construction, and resolved to improve technically and politically, in order to do a good job of large-scale factory-based, mechanized construction.

The next morning, Wang Dalong and eight other labor models, representing all the workers, visited nearby rural villages and presented gifts to the farmers. In the afternoon, they held a get-together with the farmers. Worker Gong Yinfu introduced the progress of last year's plan completion to the farmers and expressed that they would work even harder to build the tractor plant in the future to repay the farmers for their support. The farmers expressed their admiration for the workers' achievements and stated that they would humbly learn from their creative labor spirit and build a better socialist society together with the workers. In the evening, they showed films such as the Picking Tea Dance to the farmers.

In addition, the workers also held ball games and track and field competitions in various work areas, and performed rich and exciting evening programs such as lantern dances, land boat dances, and self-composed dances about liberating Taiwan and construction.

    修建拖拉机厂的职工
    满怀信心地迎接新任务
    建筑我国第一个拖拉机制造厂的职工们正以无限兴奋的心情迎接着新春。近日厂区街坊路口彩牌高竖，各个角落锣鼓喧天，歌声响亮。春节前夕，职工们座谈了拖拉机厂一九五五年的施工项目，都一致表示有充分信心来完成今年相等于去年两倍多的宿舍工程和部分厂房的修建计划；他们还检查了骄傲自满情绪和去年施工的缺点，决心从技术上政治上提高一步，以便做好工厂化、机械化的大规模施工。
    次日清晨，王大龙等九位劳动模范代表全体工人到附近农村进行访问，并给农民赠送礼物。下午他们和农民们开了个联欢会，工人龚银福向农民介绍了去年完成计划的情况，表示今后更要努力建设拖拉机厂，以答谢农民对他们的支援。农民们对工人们已有的成就表示钦佩，并要虚心学习他们创造性的劳动精神，和工人一道建设美好的社会主义。晚间他们为农民放映了采茶舞等影片。
    此外，工人们还在各工区分别举行了球赛、田径赛，表演了花灯、旱船以及自编的解放台湾、建设舞等丰富精采的晚会节目。
