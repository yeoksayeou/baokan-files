    Celebrating the Victory of Liberating Yijiangshan Island
    Good news comes from the Zhejiang front. The Chinese People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces coordinated closely, and on the 18th, they liberated Yijiangshan Island in one fell swoop. Our army's landing forces, under the cover of the navy and air force, with heroic and resolute attacks, quickly wiped out the Chiang bandit troops entrenched on the island in just two hours. This is a victory achieved by the Chinese People's Liberation Army, mastering modern military technology, and with the close coordination of the land, sea, and air forces.
    Yijiangshan Island was a long-term stronghold of the Chiang bandit troops, serving as one of the military strongholds for harassing our coastal areas. Since our naval and air forces destroyed, sank, and damaged five Chiang bandit warships on the Zhejiang front on January 10, the Chiang bandit troops on Dachen Island have been in a state of panic. However, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is still trying to appear calm, repeatedly boasting of its "strong strength." Until the 17th, it was still propagating that it maintained some kind of "initiative" and "advantage" in the sea and air between Dachen and Yijiangshan Islands. But these myths are nothing more than mirage fantasies that the remnant bandits pinned on the vast ocean, and after one night, they all vanished. The heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army cannot be stopped by the sea.
    This victory proves that the firm will of the broad masses of our people to fight for the liberation of Taiwan, our territory, is unshakable. With the concerted efforts of the broad masses of our people, Taiwan will surely be liberated.
    Celebrating the victory of the liberation of Yijiangshan Island, the people of our country will strengthen all aspects of work with greater confidence, continue to support the heroic People's Liberation Army, make persistent efforts, and strive for the victory of every battle, to achieve the final goal of liberating Taiwan and completely eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

    庆祝解放一江山岛的胜利
    浙江前线，捷报传来。中国人民解放军陆海空军部队密切配合，十八日，一举解放一江山岛。我陆军登陆部队，在海空军掩护之下，以英勇坚决的攻击，不过两小时，就迅速肃清了盘踞岛上的蒋贼军。这是中国人民解放军，掌握现代化军事技术，陆海空军紧密配合所取得的胜利。
    一江山岛是蒋贼军长期盘踞，作为骚扰我沿海地区的军事要点之一。自从一月十日我海空军部队在浙江前线击毁、击沉、击伤蒋贼军舰五艘以后，大陈岛方面的蒋贼军已慌作一团。但是，蒋介石卖国集团仍图强作镇定，一再吹嘘它的“实力雄厚”，直到十七日，它还在宣传在大陈和一江山岛之间保持着什么海空的“主动”和“优势”。可是这些神话，不过是残匪们寄托在汪洋大海上的蜃楼幻想，一夜之后，就都化为泡影了。英勇的中国人民解放军是大海所阻挡不住的。
    这个胜利证明，我国广大人民为解放我国的领土台湾的斗争的坚强意志是不可动摇的。在我国广大人民的一致努力之下，台湾一定是要解放的。
    庆祝解放一江山岛的胜利，我国人民将更加信心百倍地加强各方面的工作，继续支援英勇的人民解放军，再接再厉，争取每一个战斗的胜利，以实现解放台湾、彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团的最后目的。
