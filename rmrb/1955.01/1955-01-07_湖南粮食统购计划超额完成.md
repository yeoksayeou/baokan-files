    Hunan Province has overfulfilled its 1954-1955 grain unified purchase plan. In the Shaoyang, Xiangtan, Chenxian, and Hengyang special districts, the surplus grain sold to the state by farmers exceeded the state's original unified purchase plan. Last year, due to increased grain production and farmers' enthusiastic grain sales, the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region not only changed the situation of importing grain from other places every year in the past but also transferred 5 million jin of rice to support lake management projects. Some Miao farmers in Jishou County sang while sending grain to the granary, expressing their wish to sell grain to support national industrial construction: "We sell the golden millet to the country to support the country's early industrialization. Our Miao people hope to use tractors early, and machine farming is good and fast!"
    Proper arrangements have also been made for the unified grain sales work for the entire year. In the flood-stricken areas along Dongting Lake, the amount of grain supplied by the state has increased compared to the previous year; in the vast mountainous and hilly areas, due to the general increase in production, the number of grain-deficient households has decreased, and the amount of grain needed to be supplied by the state is generally less than the previous year. Now, grain-deficient households in various places have received the grain purchase certificates issued by the state and are putting their minds at ease into winter production. (Zhang Xianyou)

    湖南粮食统购计划超额完成
    湖南省一九五四——一九五五年度的粮食统购计划已经超额完成。在邵阳、湘潭、郴县、衡阳等专区，农民们卖给国家的余粮，都超过了国家原订的统购计划。湘西苗族自治区去年由于粮食增产和农民们踊跃卖粮，不但改变了过去每年都从外地调入粮食的情况，还调出了五百万斤大米支援治湖工程。吉首县有些苗族农民一面送粮入库，一面唱歌表示自己卖粮支援国家工业建设的心愿：“黄澄澄的谷子卖给国家，支援国家早日工业化。俺苗家好早使拖拉机，机器耕田又好又快啊！”
    全年度的粮食统销工作也进行了妥当的安排。洞庭湖滨水灾地区，国家供应粮食的数量比前年增加；广大山区、丘陵区由于普遍增产，缺粮户减少，需要国家供应粮食的数量一般都比前年减少。现在，各地的缺粮户已经领到国家发给的购粮证，安心投入冬季生产。　（张先友）
