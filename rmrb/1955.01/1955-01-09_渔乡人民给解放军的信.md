To the Editor: Please forward this to our dear comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Army, Navy, and Air Force:

We are farmers from Ant Island, Putuo County, Zhejiang. When we recall the time before liberation, when the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique ruled us, we are filled with grief and indignation. In 1949, when the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique was driven to Zhoushan, we suffered untold hardships. At that time, our fishermen could not go to sea to produce, and farmers could not cultivate the land in peace. Boats, nets, and other means of production were snatched away, our grain was looted, and sixty-three of our young men were abducted to Taiwan. While we were suffering deeply, you heroically crossed the sea, defeated the Chiang bandits entrenched on our island, and liberated the people of our island. Comrades! How grateful we are! If it weren't for the leadership of the Communist Party and your heroic battles, where would we be today? Now we have a fishing production cooperative with 891 members, an agricultural production cooperative with 36 members, and a supply and marketing cooperative on our island. Our entire island has become a collectivized fishing village. Now, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we are confidently embarking on the socialist road of fisheries mechanization step by step.

Comrades! When we think of our past tragic experiences and look at the booming socialist cause today, we think of the people of Taiwan who are still under the cruel oppression of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. Their suffering is many times greater than ours. The fishermen and farmers of Taiwan are like our own parents, brothers, and sisters. We firmly declare that we must support you in liberating Taiwan, rescuing the people of Taiwan, thoroughly eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and expelling the aggressive forces of American imperialism.

Since the national democratic parties and people's organizations issued the call to liberate Taiwan, all the people on our island have been supporting you with practical actions to improve our cooperatives and work hard to produce. In 1954, the output of offshore stake nets increased by 11 percent compared to 1953. We are working harder to reduce costs. For example, the preservatives needed for fishing nets used to be purchased with foreign exchange. Today, we use pig blood instead. We calculated that we save 500 to 600 million yuan a year, which saves the country valuable foreign exchange. Recently, we added more than a hundred stakes. Now, fishermen are setting stakes at sea, farmers are plowing the land, and women are processing. In short, every person in our township is expressing their determination to support you with practical actions.

Comrades! We have long known that liberating Taiwan is a long-term struggle task. In order to support the liberation of Taiwan, we guarantee to you: (1) We will strengthen unity, raise awareness, consolidate and improve cooperatives to support you with practical actions to increase production; and do a good job in distributing dividends to the fishing and agricultural cooperatives and selling surplus grain. (2) If you need boats, we have boats; if you need people, we have people. We will resolutely support you with all our strength. (3) We must raise vigilance, strengthen militia security work, and thoroughly eliminate counter-revolutionaries and special agents.

The entire people of Ant Township, Putuo County

    渔乡人民给解放军的信编辑同志请转亲爱的中国人民解放军陆海空军同志们：
    我们是浙江普陀县蚂蚁岛的农民。当我们回想起解放前蒋介石卖国集团统治我们的时候，我们就会悲愤万分。一九四九年蒋介石卖国集团被驱逐到舟山的时候，我们不知吃了多少苦。那时候，我们渔民不能下海生产，农民不能安心耕种。船、网等生产工具被抢走了，我们的粮食也被抢光了，还有六十三个青壮年被劫到台湾去了。在我们受着深重的苦难的时候，你们英勇地渡海过来，打垮了盘踞在我们岛上的蒋贼军，解放了我们岛上的人民。同志们！我们是多么的感激呀！假如没有共产党的领导和你们的英勇战斗，我们那有今天呢？现在我们岛上已经有一个八百九十一个社员的渔业生产合作社，有三十六个社员的农业生产合作社和一个供销合作社，我们全岛已经是一个合作化的渔乡了，现在我们正满怀信心地在中国共产党的领导下，逐步走上渔业机械化的社会主义大道。
    同志们！我们想到自己过去的悲痛遭遇和看看今天蓬勃发展的社会主义事业，我们就想到，还在蒋介石卖国集团残酷压迫下的台湾人民，他们所吃的苦，不知比我们多了好几倍，台湾的渔民和农民，是和我们自己的父母兄弟姊妹一样的，我们坚决表示，一定要支援你们去解放台湾，把台湾人民搭救出来，彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团和驱逐美国帝国主义的侵略势力。
    我们全岛人民自从全国各民主党派、各人民团体发出一定要解放台湾的号召后，我们就用搞好合作社，努力生产的行动来支援你们，一九五四年近洋涨网的产量已比一九五三年增加百分之十一。我们更加努力降低成本，例如：渔网需用的防腐剂，过去都是用外汇去买来的，今天，我们改用猪血。我们计算了一下，一年就节省了五、六亿元；这就为国家节省了宝贵的外汇。最近我们又增加了一百多个桩头，现在渔民们下海打桩，农民们耙地，妇女们加工，总之，我们全乡每个人民都表示要用实际行动来支援你们。
    同志们！我们早知道，解放台湾是一个长期的斗争任务，为了支援解放台湾，我们向你们保证：（一）我们一定加强团结，提高觉悟，巩固提高合作社，以增加生产的实际行动来支援你们；并做好渔业社、农业社的分红工作和出卖余粮工作。（二）你们要船有船，要人有人，我们决以全力来支援你们。（三）我们一定要提高警惕，加强民兵治安工作，彻底消灭反革命分子和特务分子。
                    普陀县蚂蚁乡全体人民
