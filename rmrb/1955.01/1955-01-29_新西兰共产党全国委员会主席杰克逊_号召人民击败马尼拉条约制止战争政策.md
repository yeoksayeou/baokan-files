    号召人民击败马尼拉条约制止战争政策
    【新华社二十八日讯】惠灵顿消息：新西兰“人民之声报”十九日报道，新西兰共产党全国委员会主席乔治·杰克逊最近号召展开广泛的运动来反对马尼拉条约和派遣新西兰军队到国外去。在此以前，报纸的消息说，新西兰不久将被正式要求派遣军队到马来亚去。
    杰克逊指出，美国百万富翁的政策在太平洋地区造成冲突，并加剧紧张局势。他说，所有参加马尼拉条约的国家都背叛了它们的人民的真正利益。杰克逊号召努力击败马尼拉条约，并且制止战争政策。
    杰克逊谈到蒋介石军队轰炸中国大陆时说，“这些军队是由美帝国主义加以武装和训练的”。他说：正是美帝国主义者“使这个傀儡能够扰乱太平洋的和平”。
