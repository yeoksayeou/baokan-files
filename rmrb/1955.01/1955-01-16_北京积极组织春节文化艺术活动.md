The Beijing Municipal People's Government Cultural Affairs Bureau and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League are actively organizing cultural and artistic activities for factories, mines, and rural areas during the Spring Festival. On January 15th, professional artistic groups from Beijing held a meeting with representatives from various suburban districts, factories, and mines to discuss performance programs and schedules. There are over 100 performances including Peking opera, Ping opera, song and dance, drama, acrobatics, and storytelling. Participating units include the China Peking Opera Theatre, the China Ping Opera Troupe, the China Youth Art Theatre and its affiliated Children's Theatre Troupe, the China Acrobatic Troupe, the China Broadcasting Performing Arts Troupe, the Beijing Film Actors Troupe, and the Central National Song and Dance Ensemble. Among the performances, some promote opposition to the US-Chiang treaty and the liberation of Taiwan; some promote rural mutual aid and cooperation; and some promote the Marriage Law. Many of the plays are new programs from various troupes. For example, the China Ping Opera Troupe will perform programs selected from the East China Performance. Performances will begin on January 23rd.

During the Spring Festival, suburban rural areas will also screen the films "A Suggestion" and "The Spring Breeze Blows to the Nomin River." The Cultural Affairs Bureau has also compiled and distributed a lot of singing materials, which will be distributed by various cultural centers to mobilize the masses to perform and organize other folk cultural and artistic activities.
