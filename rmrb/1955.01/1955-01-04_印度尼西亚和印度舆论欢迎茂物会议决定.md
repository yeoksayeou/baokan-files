Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 1st: Indonesian political figures and public opinion welcome the Bogor Conference's decision to convene an Asian-African conference.

    Aruzi Kartawinata of the Indonesian Islamic League Party said that the Bogor Conference's resolutions reflect a deep understanding and a far-sighted view of many issues. Kartawinata said that in the past there was an impression that Asian problems could be solved without Asian participation. After the Asian-African conference, this view will be revised.
      The "Indonesian Observer" published a commentary on December 30, saying that a common destiny links the thirty Asian and African countries that will gather at the Asian-African conference. This will be a positive step towards establishing a peaceful region in the world, and will also be an important factor in easing current tensions and a valuable contribution to maintaining peace.
    The newspaper said that it is clear that the fate of the world can no longer be decided without regard to the wishes of billions of Asians. From now on, the people of Asian countries will have an important say in world affairs and world peace. The newspaper also said that the Bogor Conference went smoothly, which proves the unity of the Colombo countries. They realize that dark forces are always trying to divide them and create discord among them, so if Asian countries are to play an important role in determining the fate of the world, they should unite.
    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 1st: The Indian "Assam Tribune" published an editorial on December 30, saying that the decision of the Prime Ministers of the five South Asian countries at the Bogor Conference to invite the People's Republic of China to participate in the Asian-African conference to be held in April is encouraging news for peace-loving people all over the world. The editorial said that China is one of the most advanced countries in the world. At the same time, with a population of 600 million, China is also the most populous country in the world. Therefore, from a democratic point of view, China's voice has the greatest value. The editorial believes that the United Nations' closing the door to China due to American policy is unfair. The demand to admit China into the United Nations must sooner or later become irresistible.
    The "Assam Tribune" said that representatives of Asian and African countries with different ideas will have a common forum. There is no question of forming a group with military obligations here, and what is needed is a forum built by Asian and African countries seeking progress and loving peace, gathering from time to time to discuss how to cooperate to maintain peace and promote trade, industry and agriculture.
    Xinhua News Agency, January 3rd: TASS, Delhi, January 1st: Newspapers in Delhi and various provinces of India widely commented on the results of the Bogor Conference. The newspapers generally gave a positive evaluation of the resolutions adopted by the conference, and particularly emphasized the importance of the Bogor Conference reaching a consensus on the issue of Asian-African conference members.
    The "New Life Daily" published in Lucknow wrote on December 30, 1954: "The Colombo countries' conference firmly believes that Asian problems cannot be solved without China's cooperation.
    "It is a great pity that China has not been able to become a member of the United Nations until now due to the stubbornness of the United States. If China were a member of the United Nations, many complex problems in Asia might have been resolved. The Asian Prime Ministers' Conference recognized China's legitimate rights and criticized the US foreign policy. Whether or not the United States allows China to join the United Nations, nothing can prevent China from playing a major role in Asian affairs. Cooperation with China is of great help in solving the problems faced by Asian and African countries."
    The resolution on the issue of Asian-African conference members, especially the invitation to China, was well received by most other newspapers.
    All newspapers emphasized that the main purpose of the Asian-African conference is to establish closer ties and cooperation between Asian and African countries to promote world peace. The "Hindustan Times" wrote in its editorial on January 1: The Asian-African conference will create the possibility of maintaining world peace through collective efforts.

    印度尼西亚和印度舆论欢迎茂物会议决定
    【新华社雅加达一日电】印度尼西亚政界人士和舆论欢迎茂物会议关于召开亚非会议的决定。
    印度尼西亚回教联盟党的阿鲁齐·卡塔韦纳塔说，茂物会议的决议反映了对许多问题的深刻了解和眼光远大的看法。卡塔韦纳塔说，过去有一种印象，好像亚洲问题可以在没有亚洲参加的情况下得到解决似的。在亚非会议后，这种看法将加以修改了。
      “印度尼西亚观察家报”十二月三十日发表评论说，共同的命运把将在亚非会议上聚集一堂的三十个亚洲和非洲国家联系起来。这将是走向在世界上建立和平地区的积极的步骤，也将是缓和目前紧张局势的重要的因素和对维护和平的可贵的贡献。
    报纸说，显然，决定世界的命运再也不能不顾亿万亚洲人民的愿望了。从今以后，亚洲各国人民在世界事务和世界和平方面将有重要的发言权。报纸又说，茂物会议开得很顺利，这证明了科伦坡国家之间的团结一致。它们认识到，黑暗势力随时都在想分裂它们并且在它们中间制造不和，因此如果亚洲国家要在决定世界命运方面起重要的作用的话，它们就应该团结起来。
    【新华社新德里一日电】印度“阿萨姆论坛报”十二月三十日发表社论说，南亚五国总理在茂物会议上决定邀请中华人民共和国参加将在四月举行的亚非会议，这是令全世界爱好和平人民感到鼓舞的消息。社论说，中国是世界最先进的国家之一。同时，拥有六亿人口的中国也是世界上人口最多的国家，因此，从民主的观点看来，中国的发言具有最大的价值。社论认为，联合国由于美国的政策的关系而对中国关起门来是不公正的。接纳中国进入联合国的要求，早晚一定要成为不可抗拒的。
    “阿萨姆论坛报”说，观念不同的亚非国家代表将有共同的讲坛，这里没有组成带有军事义务的集团的问题，而所需要的是由寻求进步和爱好和平的亚非国家建成一座论坛，时时集合起来商量怎样尽力合作来保持和平以及促进贸易、工业和农业。
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社德里一日讯：德里和印度各省的报纸广泛地评论茂物会议的结果。报纸对于会议所通过的决议一般地给予肯定的评价，并且特别着重提到茂物会议在亚非会议成员问题上取得一致意见的重要性。
    勒克瑙出版的“新生活报”一九五四年十二月三十日写道：“科伦坡国家会议坚决认为：没有中国的合作，就不可能解决亚洲的问题。
    “由于美国的执拗，中国到现在不能成为联合国的会员国，这件事引起了极大的遗憾。如果中国是联合国的会员国，亚洲的许多复杂的问题可能都已经获得解决了。亚洲国家总理会议承认中国的合法权利，并对美国的外交政策加以指责。不管美国是否让中国加入联合国，任何东西都不能阻挠中国在亚洲事务中起重大作用。和中国合作，对于解决亚非国家面临的问题有着极大的帮助。”
    关于亚非会议成员问题的决议，特别是邀请中国参加的决议，得到大多数其他报纸的良好的评价。
    所有报纸都着重说，亚非会议的主要目的就是：亚非各国之间建立更密切的联系和合作，以促进世界和平。“印度斯坦时报”一月一日的社论写道：亚非会议将为以集体努力来维护世界和平创造可能性。
