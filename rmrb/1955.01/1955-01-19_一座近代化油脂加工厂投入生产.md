A modernized oil processing plant built by the Shanghai Supply Station of the China Food Company in Shanghai has now officially gone into production. This modernized oil processing plant can render 8,000 jin of cooked lard per day. A batch of high-quality cooked lard can be rendered during the Spring Festival to meet the needs of Shanghai citizens; it can also be supplied for export in the future.

In this factory, after the raw lard is initially cut and cleaned, it is sent into the machine, and in just twenty minutes, the oil residue and moisture are completely removed. Pure and fresh cooked lard can then be packaged by an automatic packaging machine. Because the production process is fully automated, only eight workers are needed to operate all the rendering machines. The cooked lard rendered by machines in this way does not need to be re-refined, and the quality is better than that produced by manual rendering and re-refining.

    一座近代化油脂加工厂投入生产
    中国食品公司上海供应站在上海市修建的一座近代化油脂加工厂，现在已经正式投入生产。这座近代化油脂加工厂每天可熬炼出八千斤熟猪油。春节时就可以熬炼出一批品质良好的熟猪油，供应上海市民的需要；以后还可以供应出口。
    在这座工厂里，生猪油经过初切、清洗送入机器以后，只要二十分钟的时间，油渣和水分就全部去掉，纯净鲜洁的熟猪油就能通过自动包装机包装好。由于生产过程完全自动化，只需要八个工人就可操纵全部炼油机。这样用机器熬炼出来的熟猪油，不需要再一次复炼，品质比用手工熬制再复炼出来的还要好。
