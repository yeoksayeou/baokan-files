The United Nations Has No Right to Interfere in the Chinese People's Liberation of Taiwan
Chen Tiqiang
    After the Chinese people victoriously liberated Yijiangshan Island, the United States government intensified its military actions and war provocations on the one hand, and on the other hand, it instigated the so-called ceasefire through the United Nations. The U.S. aggressor group, which has occupied Taiwan for nearly five years, is attempting to use the Far East tension it has created to interfere in China's internal affairs through the United Nations, to interfere in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan, and to turn the United Nations into a tool to cover up U.S. aggression against China in preparation for a new war.
    The Chinese people resolutely oppose this conspiracy of the U.S. aggressor group and its followers. Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on January 24 once again clearly expressed the solemn position of our people. The statement said:
  “Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory. Liberating Taiwan is China's sovereignty and internal affair, and no interference by others is allowed." "The United Nations or any foreign country has no right to interfere in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan. The Government of the People's Republic of China absolutely cannot agree to the so-called ceasefire with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group that has been spurned by the Chinese people.”
    The principle that the internal affairs of any country are not subject to any interference is a basic principle of international law and is expressly stipulated in Chapter 1 "Purposes and Principles" of the United Nations Charter. Article 2, paragraph 7 of the United Nations Charter clearly stipulates: "Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state or shall require the Members to submit such matters to settlement under the present Charter.” According to this principle, the Chinese people's internal affair of eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group and liberating Taiwan, which is their own territory, is something that no foreign country or the United Nations has the right to interfere with in any way.
    American international law scholar Goodrich and Norwegian international law scholar Hambro also pointed out in their joint book "United Nations Charter" when interpreting Article 2, paragraph 7 of the Charter: "Civil war is obviously a domestic issue. Any intervention by a foreign country or a group of foreign countries to influence the course of the struggle constitutes an infringement on the independence of that country. According to this article, the United Nations organization has no right to interfere in any such internal struggle."
    The Chinese people have long liberated most of the Chinese territory and victoriously established the People's Republic of China. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group is only a remnant bandit gang entrenched on some Chinese islands under foreign protection. It has long lost any status. Liberating Taiwan is only a domestic act by the Chinese people to eliminate internal traitors and has nothing to do with any foreign country. How can any absurd attempt to demand a so-called "ceasefire" between the People's Republic of China and a handful of remnants of a traitorous group not be considered a direct interference in China's internal affairs? How can any conspiracy to instigate a so-called "ceasefire" through the United Nations not be considered a direct violation of the United Nations Charter? This is a blatant interference in China's internal affairs, and it is a blatant violation of the United Nations Charter.
    However, some people still attempt to defend the conspiracy of instigating the United Nations to interfere in China's internal affairs with the absurd argument that the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan threatens peace in the Far East. They say that although Article 2, paragraph 7 of the United Nations Charter stipulates the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of any country, the same paragraph also stipulates that "this principle shall not prejudice the application of enforcement measures under Chapter VII," and according to the various articles related to enforcement measures in Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the United Nations can take measures to prevent events that threaten and disrupt international peace.
    A country's people exercising sovereignty on their own territory and eliminating a handful of internal traitors will not threaten international peace at all. Only foreign interference will threaten and disrupt international peace. According to the last sentence of Article 2, paragraph 7 of the United Nations Charter, what the United Nations should prevent is precisely this kind of foreign interference. As the aforementioned book by Goodrich and Hambro says, the actions taken by the United Nations in this situation "cannot be directed at the purely domestic aspects of the situation."
    The Chinese people have never threatened international peace in the Far East in the entire process of exercising their sovereignty to liberate their motherland, nor is it possible to threaten international peace in the Far East. The Chinese people liberated the Chinese mainland, Hainan Island, the Zhoushan Islands, the Shengsi Islands and a large number of other islands, and no one has ever been able to claim that this caused tension in the Far East situation and threatened peace in the Far East. On the contrary, the victory of the Chinese people's liberation cause has undeniably promoted the stability of the Far East situation and greatly strengthened the forces defending peace in the Far East and the world. If it were not for the U.S. government's occupation of Taiwan and its protection of the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group, the Chinese people would have liberated Taiwan in the same way as they liberated Hainan Island, the Zhoushan Islands, and the Shengsi Islands, and it would never have caused any situation that would threaten peace in the Far East. It is baseless to describe the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan as a threat to peace in the Far East, thereby attempting to instigate the United Nations to interfere in China's internal affairs.
    In fact, it is the United States that is creating tension in the Far East and threatening and disrupting peace in the Far East. It is the U.S. government that has occupied China's territory, Taiwan. It is the U.S. government that has established military bases on China's territory, Taiwan, armed and trained the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group, and carried out various activities attempting to sabotage and subvert the People's Republic of China. It is the U.S. government that has signed the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group, openly threatening the Chinese people with force and attempting to expand its aggression against China. It is the United States that openly clamors to "use U.S. armed forces" to take "any necessary military action" to interfere in China's internal affairs. Isn't this creating tension in the Far East? Isn't this seriously threatening peace in the Far East?
    Article 2, paragraph 4 of the United Nations Charter stipulates: "All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any member state or state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations." The U.S. government's series of aggressive acts and war threats have clearly seriously violated this basic principle in the United Nations Charter. Article 1, paragraph 1 of the United Nations Charter stipulates that one of the purposes of the United Nations is "to maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace." The United Nations has an inescapable obligation to stop the U.S. government's acts of aggression and eliminate the U.S. government's threat to peace.
    If the United Nations is still willing to act in accordance with the United Nations Charter, the United Nations should immediately demand: the United States must stop interfering in China's internal affairs, and all U.S. armed forces must withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait.

    联合国无权干涉中国人民解放台湾
    陈体强
    中国人民胜利解放了一江山岛以后，美国政府就一面加紧军事行动，进行战争挑衅，另一面又策动通过联合国来进行所谓停火的诡计。霸占台湾已近五年的美国侵略集团竟企图利用它自己所一手造成的远东紧张局势通过联合国来干涉中国的内政，干涉中国人民解放台湾，把联合国变成掩盖美国侵略中国准备新战争的工具。
    中国人民坚决反对美国侵略集团及其追随者的这种阴谋。周恩来总理一月二十四日的声明已经又
  一次明确表示了我国人民的严正立场。声明说：
  “台湾是中国领土的不可分割的一部分。解放台湾是中国的主权和内政，决不容他人干涉。”“联合国或任何外国都无权干涉中国人民解放台湾。中华人民共和国政府绝对不能同意同中国人民所唾弃了的蒋介石卖国集团实行所谓停火”。
    任何一国内政不容任何干涉的原则是国际法的基本原则，是联合国宪章第一章“宗旨及原则”中的明文规定。联合国宪章第二条第七款就明确规定：“本宪章不得认为授权联合国干涉在本质上属于任何国家国内管辖之事件，且并不要求会员国将该项事件依本宪章提请解决”。根据这一原则，中国人民消灭蒋介石卖国集团、解放本国领土台湾的内政问题，就是任何外国和联合国都无权进行任何干涉的。
    美国的国际法学者古德里区和挪威的国际法学者汉布罗在他们合著的“联合国宪章”一书中解释宪章第二条第七款时也曾指出：“内战显然是一个内政问题。一个外国或一个外国集团为要影响斗争的过程而进行的任何干涉，都构成对该国独立的侵犯。按照本条规定，联合国组织无权干涉任何这种内部斗争”。
    中国人民早已解放了中国领土的绝大部分，胜利地建立了中华人民共和国。蒋介石卖国集团只是在外国的庇护下盘据在中国若干岛屿上的残余匪帮，早已失去了任何的地位，解放台湾只是中国人民消灭内部卖国贼的国内行为，与任何外国无干。任何要求中华人民共和国同一小撮卖国集团的残余分子进行所谓“停火”的荒谬企图，怎么能说不是直接干涉中国的内政？任何通过联合国策动所谓“停火”的阴谋，怎么能说不是直接违反了联合国的宪章？这是对中国内政的露骨的干涉，这是对联合国宪章的彰明昭著的破坏。
    但是却还有人企图以所谓中国人民解放台湾威胁了远东和平的荒谬论点，来替策动联合国干涉中国内政的阴谋作辩护。他们说，联合国宪章第二条第七款虽然规定了不得干涉任何国家内政的原则，但是同一条款中也规定了，“此项原则不妨碍第七章内执行办法之适用”，而根据联合国宪章第七章有关执行办法的各条款，联合国可以对威胁和破坏国际和平的事件采取制止措施。
      一国人民在自己的领土上行使主权，消灭国内的一小撮卖国贼，根本是不会威胁到国际和平的。只有外国的干涉才会使国际和平遭到威胁和破坏。根据联合国宪章第二条第七款的最后一句，联合国所应该予以制止的正是这种外国干涉。正如前引古德里区和汉布罗所著一书中所说的，联合国在这种情况下所采取的行动“不能指向局势的纯国内方面”。
    中国人民在整个行使主权解放祖国的过程中，从来没有威胁过远东的国际和平，也不可能威胁远东的国际和平。中国人民解放了中国大陆，解放了海南岛、舟山群岛和嵊泗群岛等大批岛屿，从来就没有任何人能够提出这引起了远东局势的紧张，威胁了远东的和平。相反地，中国人民解放事业的胜利无可否认地促进了远东局势的稳定，大大地加强了保卫远东和世界和平的力量。如果不是美国政府霸占台湾，庇护蒋介石卖国集团的残余分子，中国人民早已像解放海南岛、舟山群岛和嵊泗群岛等一样地解放了台湾，也决不可能引起任何威胁远东和平的局势。把中国人民解放台湾说成是威胁远东和平，从而企图策动联合国干涉中国的内政，是没有任何根据的。
      事实上，造成远东紧张局势，威胁和破坏远东和平的正是美国。是美国政府霸占了中国的领土台湾。是美国政府在中国领土台湾上建立军事基地，武装和训练蒋介石卖国集团的残余分子，进行种种企图破坏和颠覆中华人民共和国的活动。是美国政府同蒋介石卖国集团签订了所谓“共同防御条约”，公然以武力威胁中国人民，企图扩大对中国的侵略。是美国公开叫嚣，“使用美国的武装部队”，为干涉中国内政采取“必需的任何军事行动”。这难道不是制造远东的紧张局势？这难道不是严重地威胁了远东的和平？
    联合国宪章第二条第四款规定：“各会员国在其国际关系上不得使用威胁或武力，或以与联合国宗旨不符之任何其他方法，侵害任何会员国或国家之领土完整或政治独立。”美国政府一系列的侵略行为和战争威胁显然严重违反了联合国宪章中的这一基本原则。联合国宪章第一条第一款规定，联合国的宗旨之一就是“维持国际和平及安全；并为此目的，采取有效集体办法，以防止且消除对于和平之威胁，制止侵略行为或其他和平之破坏”。联合国负有不可逃避的义务制止美国政府的侵略行为，消除美国政府对于和平的威胁。
      如果联合国还愿意按照联合国宪章办事的话，联合国就应该立即提出：美国必须停止对中国内政的干涉，美国的一切武装力量必须从台湾和台湾海峡撤走。
