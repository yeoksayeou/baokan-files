    "Albanian Speed"
    ——Albanian Sketches
    Cui Qi
    In Albania, you will quickly become familiar with a word: "I Para," meaning "the first." Albanian comrades are always happy to tell you: here is their first textile factory, the first sugar refinery, there is their first film studio, the first Academy of Sciences. In the short few days of our visit to Albania, on the eve of the tenth anniversary of liberation, their first cement plant and glass factory were completed.
    Whether from the capital to the borderlands, from the valleys to the plains, everywhere makes you feel the pulse of new life beating. What didn't exist in the past, now exists; what was small in scale, has been expanded; what was damaged by war, has been restored; what was old, has become new. The whole of Albania is like a large construction site, with the liberated people building their motherland with boundless enthusiasm.
    New heroes are constantly being born and growing. "Advanced worker," "rationalization proposer," "shock brigade," "volunteer work team" – these glorious titles have become an inspiring force for the Albanian people. The names of advanced workers such as oil worker Peter Ordashi, miners Beyu Sinani and Pullen Doda, textile workers Shavett Aliucci and Avergida Basco, have spread throughout the country and are highly respected by the people.
    In many factories, advanced workers make up almost half of the workforce.
    When we visited the Korca Brewery, the factory director, Foni Tsana, told us:
    "Out of the hundred workers in the factory, forty are now advanced workers. We are planning to make all the workers advanced workers."
    A similar situation appeared at the "November 8th Sugar Refinery." There were a thousand workers there, of which five hundred were advanced workers.
    I heard about the life journey of an advanced worker at the sugar refinery: Peterachi Vitte was originally a poor peasant, and he joined the sugar refinery when it was first established. Initially, he did odd jobs, chopping wood and nailing boxes every day. At that time, his work was very good. Later, he actively participated in training courses set up by workers who had returned from the Soviet Union, and he learned very well. A new attitude towards labor and a new spirit of learning finally transformed him from a farmer into an excellent worker who could operate new Soviet machines. Now he has completed 130% of his production quota, and the quality is first-rate.
    Albanian comrades told us that when mentioning their achievements, the Soviet Union can never be forgotten. The Soviet Union's help to Albania is meticulous.
    It often happens that a Soviet ship sets sail from Odessa, carrying Soviet experts and engineers, loaded with complete sets of Soviet machines. It sails through several seas and straits, and arrives at Durrës in Albania. These Soviet friends help Albanian workers build factories, assemble machines, and only leave Albania after the factory starts production and produces the first batch of finished products.
    Thanks to the help of the Soviet Union, Albanian workers always learn new technologies in the shortest possible time. Therefore, in some factories, workers with only two years of experience are called "old workers." "Old workers" teach new workers, and new workers quickly become "old workers." The young Albanian working class is developing and expanding rapidly.
    Under the system of landlords and capitalists, life was stagnant, and people could not find things to do anywhere. After liberation, the river of life flowed, and people were needed everywhere. The Albanian youth understand that they must grow faster and do more. Albanian women have also taken off the veils they have worn for centuries and have taken up various positions in the construction cause. They learn culture with touching enthusiasm, learn science, learn how to fight for a new life, and sing for a new life.
    Albania has become a country of youth.
    We visited the Agricultural Research Institute in Tirana. There were a total of thirty senior agricultural experts there, and none of them were over forty years old.
    The Dean of the Agricultural College, Piro Dogbeba, who accompanied us throughout the visit, told me at the time of parting that he had just turned thirty. All the singers in Albania, except for six, are young.
    However, we also saw old people working everywhere. They worked as enthusiastically as young people, and they also became young.
    Everywhere is a vibrant scene.
    It is these vibrant Albanian people who have created miracles in their own country. In ten years, they have completed construction projects that could not be completed in the past few centuries. In ten years, they have brought Albania from the sixteenth century to the twentieth century, and are moving forward along the road of socialism with full confidence.
    We visited the "Ten Years of People's Power" exhibition in Tirana. Here, even those who dislike paying attention to numbers cannot help but be moved by the numbers on those statistical tables. When people calculate the speed of progress in various sectors of Albania's economy and culture, they often do not say a few percent, but several times, ten times, dozens of times! For example, in 1954, the total industrial output increased to 11.4 times that of pre-war levels. Electricity - 25 times, coal - 45.3 times, construction scale - 12 times, rice - 10.3 times, cotton - 75 times.
    Since liberation, Albania has published more books than it has published in the past five centuries. In the past, more than 80% of the residents were illiterate, but by the end of 1955, when the Five-Year Plan is completed, illiteracy among people under the age of forty across the country will be completely eliminated. At that time, teachers will increase to eight times the pre-war level, agronomists - four times, health workers - two and a half times, and engineers in various industries - seventeen times.
    At the exhibition, visiting foreign friends called this leap-forward development speed of Albania's construction cause: "Albanian Speed." (Attached picture)

    “阿尔巴尼亚的速度”
    ——阿尔巴尼亚散记
    崔奇
    在阿尔巴尼亚，你很快地就会听熟一个字：“爱巴拉”，即“第一个”。阿尔巴尼亚的同志们总是怀着愉快的心情告诉你：这儿是他们的第一个纺织厂，第一个制糖厂，那儿是他们的第一个电影制片厂，第一个科学院。就在我们访问阿尔巴尼亚的短短几天里，在解放十周年的前夕，他们的第一个水泥厂和玻璃厂又落成了。
    不论从首都到边疆，从山谷到平原，到处都使你感到新生活的脉搏在跳动。过去没有的，现在有了；规模小的，扩大了；遭受战争破坏的，修复了；陈旧的，变新了。整个阿尔巴尼亚就像一个大的建筑工地，解放了的人民在以无限的劳动热忱建设着自己的祖国。
    新的英雄人物在不断诞生和成长。“先进工作者”，“合理化建议者”，“突击队”，“志愿工作队”——这些光荣的称号，成为对阿尔巴尼亚人民鼓舞力量。炼油工人彼得·奥尔达希，矿工贝尤·西纳尼和普伦·多达，纺织工人沙弗特·阿留希和阿弗吉达·巴斯柯等先进工作者的名字，传遍了全国，受到人民的极大尊敬。
    在许多工厂里，先进工作者几乎占工人的半数。
    当我们去参观科尔察啤酒厂时，厂长佛尼·察那告诉我们说：
    “全厂一百个工人，现在四十个工人是先进工作者。我们正打算使所有的工人都成为先进工作者呢。”
    类似的情形出现在“十一月八日制糖厂”。那里有一千工人，其中五百人是先进工作者。
    我听到了关于制糖厂的一位先进工作者的生活道路：彼得拉奇·维特原来是贫农，制糖厂刚建立时他就参加了工作。最初是做零活的，每天劈柴，钉箱子。那时候，他的工作就非常好。后来他积极参加了从苏联回国的工人所开办的训练班，结果又是学得非常好。新的劳动态度和新的学习精神终于使他从一个农民变为一个能操纵苏联新式机器的优秀工人。现在他已完成生产定额的百分之一百三十，而质量是头等的。
    阿尔巴尼亚同志告诉我们，在提到他们的成绩时，是永远也不能忘记苏联的。苏联对阿尔巴尼亚的帮助是无微不至的。
    常常有这样的事情：一只苏联轮船从奥德萨启锚了，上边坐着苏联专家和工程师，载着成套的苏联机器，它航过几个海和海峡，来到了阿尔巴尼亚的都拉斯。这些苏联朋友们帮助阿尔巴尼亚工人们建厂，装配机器，直到工厂开工，出产了第一批成品，才离开阿尔巴尼亚。
    由于苏联的帮助，阿尔巴尼亚工人们总是用最短的时间学会新的技术。因此，在一些工厂里，只有两年工龄的工人，人家就叫他“老工人”了。“老工人”要教新工人，新工人又很快地变为“老工人”。年轻的阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级正在迅速发展和扩大。
    在地主资本家的制度下，生活是停滞不前的，人们到处都找不到事情做。解放以后，生活的江河奔流了，到处都需要人。阿尔巴尼亚的青年们懂得，他们必须更快地成长，做更多的事情。阿尔巴尼亚妇女们也脱下了戴了几世纪的面罩，走上建设事业的各种岗位。他们以感人的热情学习文化，学习科学，学习怎样为新生活而斗争，为新生活而歌唱。
    阿尔巴尼亚成了一个青年的国度。
    我们在地拉那参观过农业研究所。那儿一共有三十位高级的农业专家，没有一个人超过四十岁。
  一直陪着我们参观的农学院院长彼洛·多格贝巴在临别时告诉我，他刚刚满三十。全阿尔巴尼亚的歌唱家，除了六个人以外，都是年轻的。
    可是，我们也到处看到年老的人在工作，他们像青年人一样地热情工作，他们也变成了青年。
    到处都是一片朝气蓬勃的景象。
    就是这些朝气蓬勃的阿尔巴尼亚人民在自己的祖国创造了奇迹。十年之间，他们完成了过去几个世纪都不能完成的建设事业。十年之间，他们把阿尔巴尼亚从十六世纪带到了二十世纪，并信心百倍地沿着社会主义的道路前进。
    我们在地拉那参观过“人民政权的十年”展览会。在这里，就是最不喜欢注意数目字的人，也不能不被那些统计表上的数目字所感动。当人们在计算阿尔巴尼亚经济和文化各部门的进展速度时，常常不是说百分之几，而是说几倍，十几倍，几十倍！例如，一九五四年，工业总产量增为战前的十一点四倍。电力——二十五倍，煤——四十五点三倍，建筑规模——十二倍，米——十点三倍，棉花——七十五倍。
    解放以来，阿尔巴尼亚出版的书籍比过去五个世纪所出版的还要多。过去，百分之八十以上的居民是文盲，但到一九五五年底，当五年计划完成的时候，全国四十岁以下的文盲即将完全被扫除。那时候，教师将增为战前的八倍，农学家——四倍，保健人员——两倍半，各业工程师——十七倍。
    在展览会上，来访的外国朋友们把阿尔巴尼亚建设事业的这种飞跃发展的速度叫做：“阿尔巴尼亚的速度”。（附图片）
