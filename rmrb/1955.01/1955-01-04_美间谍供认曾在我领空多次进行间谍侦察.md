Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: William Hele Baumer, the American spy recently sentenced by our country, confessed that before he was shot down over Northeast China in January 1953, he "had carried out several special aerial photography missions over the coastlines of China and the Soviet Union."

Baumer was led by Arnold, commander of the U.S. "581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing," himself, when he sneaked into the airspace of Liaoning Province, China, for espionage reconnaissance activities. He was sentenced to eight years in prison. Arnold confessed that his wing "is a special task force dedicated to serving the Central Intelligence Agency." This wing was stationed at Clark Air Base in the Philippines.

According to Baumer's confession, in December 1951, he carried out an aerial photography mission over the Chinese coast between Hainan Island and Taiwan. He said: "I flew to Clark Air Base in the Philippines, where I waited for a suitable weather forecast. We took off, flew to Hainan Island, and began taking photos of towns, airports, seaports, and so on." In January 1952, he carried out another aerial photography mission over the Chinese coast between Taiwan and Shanghai.

Baumer was the operations officer of the U.S. Far East Air Force's "91st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron." He said that the "photography" and "electronic reconnaissance" missions carried out by this squadron "were regarded as absolutely confidential."

He confessed that he had also conducted reconnaissance flights over the coast of Siberia and other Far Eastern islands of the Soviet Union. "In the autumn of 1951, I made a photographic flight along the coast of Siberia and the coast of Sakhalin Island; another one was in September 1951 along the Lower Kuril Islands, and another one was in early October 1951 along the Sakhalin Island coast of the Sea of Okhotsk, and another one was in October 1951 along the northern coast of the Sea of Okhotsk."

    美间谍供认曾在我领空多次进行间谍侦察
    【新华社三日讯】最近被我国判处的美国籍间谍威廉·赫尔·包莫供认，他在一九五三年一月在我国东北上空被击落之前，“曾在中国和苏联的海岸线执行过几次特别的空中摄影飞行任务”。
    包莫是由美国“五八一空中补给与通讯联队”司令官阿诺德亲自率领偷入我国辽宁省上空进行间谍侦察活动的，他被判处八年徒刑。阿诺德供认他的联队“是专门为中央情报局服务的一个担任特别任务的联队”。这个联队驻在菲律宾克拉克空军基地。
    据包莫供认，一九五一年十二月他曾在海南岛和台湾之间的中国海岸上空执行过一次空中摄影飞行任务。他说：“我飞到菲律宾的克拉克机场，在那里等候适宜的气候预报。我们起飞，飞往海南岛，开始拍摄城镇、机场、海港等的照片”。一九五二年一月，他在台湾和上海之间的中国海岸上空执行过另一次空中摄影飞行任务。
    包莫是美国远东空军“九一战略侦察中队”的作战官。他说这个中队执行的“摄影”和“电子侦察”的任务“是被看作绝对机密的”。
    他供认，他还在西伯利亚沿海和其他苏联远东的岛屿上空作过侦察飞行。“我在一九五一年秋，沿西伯利亚海岸和库页岛海岸作过一次摄影飞行；另一次是在一九五一年九月沿下千岛群岛进行的，还有一次是在一九五一年十月初沿鄂霍次克海库页岛海岸进行的，还有一次是在一九五一年十月沿鄂霍次克海北部海岸进行的”。
