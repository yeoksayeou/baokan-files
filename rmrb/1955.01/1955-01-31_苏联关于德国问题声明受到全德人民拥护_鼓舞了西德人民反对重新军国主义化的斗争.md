Xinhua News Agency, January 30th, Berlin Dispatch: The Soviet government's statement on the German question and the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on ending the state of war between the Soviet Union and Germany have timely reflected the urgent desire of the German people to strive for national unity and peace, and have further inspired the German people's struggle against West German remilitarization.

In the German Democratic Republic, 4,500 miners in Halle District of Mutchen have written to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, thanking the Soviet Union for ending the state of war with Germany.

Workers at the Matthias-Thesen shipyard in Wismar held a meeting to unanimously welcome the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.

The "National Daily" reported on January 27th that the Central Committee of the National Democratic Party of Germany held a special meeting in Berlin on the 26th, endorsing the decision of the Soviet Supreme Soviet. The statement issued by the Central Committee of the National Democratic Party stated that ending the state of war between the Soviet Union and Germany will help peacefully reunify Germany and conclude a peace treaty with the whole of Germany. This recent peaceful action by the Soviet Union is in the interests of all the German people.

In West Germany, the people's desire for peace and German unity can be seen in the numerous rallies held in various parts of West Germany these days, as well as in the letters and telegrams from representatives of all walks of life to the members of the Federal Parliament.

Opposition to the Paris Accords has become the main theme of demonstrations held in the Benzenburg area of Bavaria. Participants in the parade held up banners with slogans such as: "Fight against the militarist policy of the Bonn ruling group and strive for the reunification of Germany."

In Feldberg, approximately 1,500 people held a rally to protest against the Paris Accords. They passed a resolution demanding immediate negotiations on the reunification of Germany.

Former Center Party member of the Federal Parliament, Tia Arnold, called on all members of the Federal Parliament to vote against the Paris Accords in accordance with the wishes of the majority of voters. She expressed her welcome to the decision of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and emphasized that this document shows that the Soviet government is working hard to establish good-neighborly relations with the German people.

The strong desire of the West German people to peacefully reunify their motherland is also clearly reflected in West German political circles. The chairman of the German Social Democratic Party, Ollenhauer, once again requested the West German government on the evening of the 28th to postpone the ratification of the Paris Accords. He requested the Federal Government and the three Western countries to negotiate in order to consider whether it is possible to start direct negotiations with the Soviet Union on the Soviet government's statement on the German question on January 15th.

Even the Free Democratic Party, one of the ruling parties in the Bonn government, recently told the press that: If the Free Democratic Party agrees with the Soviet peace proposals, no one will think it is inappropriate to do so. It is unwise to regard the Soviet proposal as merely a "superficial action." Now Germany has a basis for holding negotiations with the Soviet Union, and it is "foolish" not to recognize this.

    苏联关于德国问题声明受到全德人民拥护
    鼓舞了西德人民反对重新军国主义化的斗争
    【新华社三十日讯】柏林消息：苏联政府关于德国问题的声明和苏联最高苏维埃主席团关于结束苏联和德国之间战争状态的命令，及时反映了使德国人民争取国家统一和争取和平的迫切愿望，也进一步鼓舞了德国人民反对西德重新军国主义化的斗争。
    在德意志民主共和国，穆契恩（哈雷区）的四千五百个矿工已经写信给苏联最高苏维埃主席团，感谢苏联结束同德国的战争状态。
    威斯马的马提亚斯—德森造船厂职工举行大会，一致欢迎苏联最高苏维埃主席团的命令。
    “国民日报”一月二十七日报道，民主德国的国家民主党中央委员会二十六日在柏林举行特别会议，拥护苏联最高苏维埃的决定。国家民主党中央委员会发表的声明说，结束苏联同德国之间的战争状态将有助于和平重新统一德国和同整个德国缔结和约。苏联最近的这个和平行动是符合于全体德国人民的利益的。
    在西德，人民争取和平和德国统一的愿望可以在西德各地这些天以来举行的许许多多集会以及各阶层人民的代表给联邦议院议员们的信件和电报中看出来。
    反对巴黎协定成了巴伐利亚州本兹堡地方举行的示威游行的主要内容，参加游行的人高举着旗帜，上面写着：为反对波恩统治集团的军国主义政策、争取德国的重新统一而斗争。
    在费尔德堡大约有一千五百人举行集会抗议巴黎协定。他们通过了一项要求立刻就德国重新统一问题进行谈判的决议。
    前中央党的联邦议院议员蒂亚·阿诺德要求联邦议院全体议员根据大部分选民的意愿投票反对巴黎协定。她对苏联最高苏维埃主席团的决定表示欢迎，她强调说这个文件表明苏联政府正在努力同德国人民建立善邻关系。
    西德人民要求和平统一祖国的强烈愿望也在西德政界得到明显的反映。德国社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔二十八日晚间再次向西德政府要求延期批准巴黎协定。他要求联邦政府和三个西方国家进行商谈，以便考虑是否有可能同苏联就苏联政府一月十五日关于德国问题的声明开始进行直接的商谈。
    连作为波恩政府执政党之一的自由民主党也在最近向报界表示说：假如自由民主党赞同苏联的和平建议的话，没有一个人会认为这样做是不适当的。把苏联的建议看成只是一个“表面的行动”是不明智的。现在德国已经有了同苏联举行谈判的基础，不认识这一点是“愚蠢”的。
