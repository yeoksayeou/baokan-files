In Taiyuan city, among the demobilized construction soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers participating in industrial production, more than 80 people have recently been selected as Taiyuan's demobilized construction soldier models and revolutionary disabled soldier models.

These demobilized construction soldier models and revolutionary disabled soldier models have become outstanding workers after participating in the motherland's economic construction. Jiao Guoping, a revolutionary disabled soldier working as a foundry worker in the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory, joined the Red Army at the age of fourteen. He experienced the Long March and the arduous War of Resistance Against Japan. After entering the factory in 1953, he painstakingly studied technology. In the burr removal group, he managed to increase labor efficiency by three times. At the steelmaking furnace, he put forward good opinions on many critical aspects, ensuring safe tapping of steel. Wang Fenghua, an underground trolley worker at the Ximing Coking Plant, was demobilized in 1953 and participated in production. As soon as he entered the factory, he happily took on the arduous task of transporting coke. Over the past two years, he and other workers have developed the "cyclic allocation method," which has doubled labor productivity.

In Nanjing city, more than 30 demobilized construction soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers have been elected by the people of various districts as models in various tasks, and have been commended and rewarded by the local people's government.

Xu Wankun, a demobilized construction soldier and special-class model working as a driver in the Jiangnan Automobile Company, improved operating methods in the labor competition, reducing the oil consumption rate by 44 percent. Shan Zhengping, a revolutionary disabled soldier and special-class model, is a representative of the People's Congress of Liufu Township in the suburbs. He actively took the lead in the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement and the unified grain purchase. He also often assisted the village militia in preventing the activities of bad elements. Ma Yanfu, a demobilized construction soldier working as a clerk at Gulou Primary School, loves his work and often carries young children in the kindergarten home in rain and snow, earning the love and respect of the students' parents. Liu Shengyun, a revolutionary disabled soldier, was demobilized to the Nanjing Department Store in 1953 as a salesman. He has always been active and responsible in his work, diligently studying culture, and was once elected as a representative of the Nanjing Municipal People's Congress. (Xinhua News Agency)

    南京市有三十多个复员建设军人和革命残废军人被各区人民群众评选为各项工作的模范，并受到了当地人民政府的表扬和奖励。
    在江南汽车公司担任驾驶员的复员建设军人、特等模范徐万堃在劳动竞赛中，改进操作方法，使机油消耗率降低百分之四十四。革命残废军人、特等模范单正平是郊区柳袱乡人民代表大会代表。他在农村互助合作运动和粮食统购工作中，都能积极带头参加。他还经常协助村里的民兵防止坏分子活动。在鼓楼小学担任公务员的复员建设军人马燕福热爱自己的工作，下雨下雪时，经常抱送幼儿班的儿童回家，受到学生家长们的敬爱。革命残废军人刘生云一九五三年复员到南京市百货公司担任营业员，工作一贯积极负责，刻苦学习文化，曾经被选为南京市人民代表大会代表。（新华社）
