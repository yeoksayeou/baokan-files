    Finding a Way Out for "Idle Money"
    The article "‘Idle Money’ Finds a Proper Outlet," published in the Shanxi Daily on December 24th last year, reflects a new situation in the economic life of farmers. Last year, due to the bumper cotton harvest and the state's unified purchase, the 157 households in Zhuangli Village, Baima Township, Yicheng County, Shanxi Province, earned more money than in any previous year. Except for the ten households with a large population and little land, 147 households felt that they had nowhere to spend the money after selling cotton in a concentrated manner. As a result, many members and cadres of the "August 1st" Agricultural Production Cooperative, who did not necessarily need bicycles, ordered bicycles. One female member, because she could receive more than two million yuan in cotton dividends, planned to spend one million yuan to buy a good woolen suit for her husband, children, and herself. Some farmers planned to carry out large-scale construction to build houses, and some farmers bought daily necessities that they would not need for another six months. … This article summarizes the situation in this village as: life was consistently simple in the past, but now a wasteful trend has suddenly emerged.
    After raising this noteworthy issue, the article then proposes a solution based on Zhuangli Village's experience in organizing farmers to live a planned life. The article states: The situation in Zhuangli Village reminded the comrades of the Baima Township Branch of the Chinese Communist Party and the cadres of the township government, making them realize that if farmers cannot spend money in a planned manner, it will not only affect production due to wasteful living, but also lead to worse consequences. They first calculated the overall account of farmers' income and expenditure, giving them a clear understanding of how to lead farmers in planning their lives. Subsequently, under the leadership of the branch and the township government, the Party members and cadres of Zhuangli Village convened a mass meeting of all villagers and a women's congress of all villagers. The "August 1st" Agricultural Production Cooperative also held a members' meeting, where they used two typical examples of farmers in the village who either spent money extravagantly or meticulously planned to expand production, to conduct ideological education for everyone. After the meeting, the village's three cooperative economic organizations for production, supply, and credit also signed a "three-way combination contract" to organize the economic life of the 141 members of the "August 1st" Agricultural Production Cooperative. As a result, those who originally planned to buy bicycles changed their minds to exchange and purchase better livestock; those who originally planned to keep more pocket money also proposed to save idle money in order to invest in expanding reproduction in a planned manner. All the scattered funds of the village's farmers found an outlet, and the wastefulness that had just begun in the village quickly stopped.
    It can be seen from this article in the Shanxi Daily that helping farmers arrange their economic lives is a new issue not only in practical work but also in newspaper propaganda. The newspaper is an enthusiastic organizer of the economic life of the masses, and it should find a way out for the farmers' "idle money" and guide them to live a planned life. (An Jiang)

    为“闲钱”找出路
    去年十二月二十四日山西日报登载的一篇通讯“‘闲钱’找到了正当出路”，反映了农民经济生活中的一个新情况：山西翼城县白马乡庄里村的一百五十七户农民，去年由于棉花丰收和国家统购，收入的钱比哪一年都多。除了人多地少的十户以外，一百四十七户农民都感到集中卖棉以后的钱没处花销。于是，“八一”农业生产合作社的社员和干部当中，好些人并不太需要自行车，都订购了自行车。一个女社员因为棉花分红可以分得二百多万元，就划算着用一百万元给她的男人、孩子和她自己各买一身好毛衣穿。有些农民打算大兴土木修盖房屋，有的农民一下子买了半年以内还用不着的生活用品。……这篇通讯概括这个村子的情况是：过去的生活一贯简朴，如今忽然兴起了一股子浪费的风气。
    通讯在提出这个值得注意的问题之后，又用庄里村组织农民有计划过日子的经验，提出了解决这个问题的办法。通讯中说：庄里村的这种情况提醒了中共白马乡支部的同志和乡政府的干部，使他们看到：农民如果不能有计划地花钱，不但会因为生活浪费影响了生产，还会出现更坏的结果。他们首先算了农民收入和开支的总帐，对领导农民有计划过光景的事心中有了底。接着，在支部和乡政府的领导下，庄里村的党员和干部们召开了全村群众大会和全村妇女大会，“八一”农业生产合作社又开了社员大会，会上都用本村农民中手头有钱挥霍浪费和精打细算扩大生产的两种典型例子，向大家进行了思想教育。会后，村子里生产、供销、信用三种合作经济组织，还订了个“三结合合同”，把“八一”农业生产合作社一百四十一户社员的经济生活组织起来。这样一来，原来打算买自行车的，就改变为要调换和购买好的牲口；原来打算手头多存零花钱的，也提出要把闲钱储蓄起来，以便有计划地投资扩大再生产。全村农民所有的闲散资金找到了出路，村子里刚刚开始的浪费现象也迅速停止了。
    从山西日报这篇通讯可以看出：帮助农民安排经济生活，不只是实际工作中而且也是报纸宣传中的一个新问题。报纸是群众经济生活的热情的组织者，它应该为农民的“闲钱”找出路，引导农民有计划地过日子。　（安江）
