China's Largest New Inland River Passenger Ship
    The "Jiangxin" to Officially Set Sail Today

The "Jiangxin" passenger ship, entrusted by the Yangtze River Navigation Administration to the Shanghai Ship Repair and Building Factory for repair and reconstruction, officially underwent sea trials on January 18th. The trials went well, and the ship will be put into production starting January 19th, departing for Hankou on the same day.

This ship was originally a large passenger and cargo ship on the Shanghai-Hankou route. In September 1949, it was bombed and sunk by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit planes, with the superstructure completely destroyed. It was salvaged in 1953, and after a year of hard work by Soviet experts and a large number of workers, it has been successfully reconstructed. The total tonnage of the reconstructed "Jiangxin" is 4031.26 tons, the length is 106.43 meters, the width is 13.4 meters, the draft is 3.8 meters, it can carry 800 tons of cargo, and accommodate 918 passengers. The passenger capacity has increased threefold compared to the original "Jiangxin."

The reconstruction of the "Jiangxin" adopted the suggestions of Soviet experts, abolishing the multi-class system and eliminating the fourth and fifth class cabins, ensuring that every passenger has a fixed berth. The beds inside the ship are comfortable, all rooms have heating in winter and electric fans in summer, as well as ventilation and sanitary facilities. Water filters continuously provide passengers with hot and cold fresh water. To take care of mothers and children, the ship has a dedicated mother-child room and a children's club. There is also a comfortable restaurant, passenger club, infirmary, barber shop, post office, etc. To ensure the safety of the ship, there are fire hoses and a life jacket for each person. New automatic features include automatic food delivery elevators, automatic refueling machines, and automatic coal cinder flushing pipes. An air preheater has been newly installed on the furnace. The rebuilt "Jiangxin" is the largest new inland river passenger ship in the country. (Our Shanghai Reporter Station)

    我国内河最大的一艘新式客轮
    江新轮定今日正式开航
    由长江航运管理局委托上海船舶修造厂修理和改建的江新轮，已在一月十八日正式试航，情况良好，从十九日起投入生产，当天开往汉口。
    这艘轮船原是沪汉航线上的大型客货轮，一九四九年九月遭蒋贼飞机炸毁沉没，船身上层建筑全部毁坏，一九五三年打捞出水，经过苏联专家帮助和广大职工一年的辛勤劳动，已经改建成功。重建后的江新轮的总吨位是四○三一点二六吨，船长一○六点四三公尺，宽一三点四公尺，吃水三点八公尺，可载货八百吨，同时容纳旅客九百一十八人。在载客量上较原江新轮增加三倍。
    江新轮的改建，接受了苏联专家建议，废除了多级制，取消了四、五等客位，使每个旅客都有固定舱位。船内床铺舒适，全部房间到冬天有暖气，热天有电风扇，并有通风和卫生设备，还有滤水器不断供给旅客冷热清水。为了照顾母亲和孩子，船上专辟有母子室和儿童俱乐部，另有舒适的餐厅，旅客俱乐部、保健室、理发室、邮电间等。为了保证船上安全，设有防火管和每人一件救生衣。在新式自动设置方面有自动送菜升降机、自动加油机、自动煤屑冲管，在炉子上新装空气预热器。重建后的江新轮是全国内河最大的一艘新式客轮。　（本报上海记者站）
