    Xinhua News Agency, New York, 12th TASS: Associated Press reported that the Costa Rican government announced on the evening of the 11th that troops invading from Nicaragua had occupied several cities in northern Costa Rica and were advancing towards the capital, San José.
    According to a United Press International correspondent in San José, Costa Rican volunteer forces fought with the interventionist troops near Villa Quesada. Costa Rican civil aviation aircraft, equipped with machine guns, fired on the invading troops from the air. It is reported that the interventionist troops suffered losses as a result of this action.
    Xinhua News Agency, New York, 12th TASS: According to a United Press International correspondent from San José, Costa Rican President Figueres announced that armed forces invading from Nicaragua had crossed the border deep into Costa Rican territory and occupied Quesada, a residential area 35 miles from the Costa Rican capital.
    Figueres pointed out that this invasion was the beginning of an "aggression prepared for several years."
    Figueres said that the interventionists were using transport planes to transport troops, and their direct purpose was to prepare for landing in the Quesada area and use Quesada as a base to expand the invasion.
    Figueres said, "We are prepared to strike back at the interventionists with all the strength we have." He expressed his hope that the Organization of American States would take swift and effective measures to stop the armed intervention.
    Xinhua News Agency, Montevideo, 12th TASS: Uruguayan newspapers, commenting on the Costa Rican events, condemned the conspiracy of certain groups in the Western Hemisphere to turn Costa Rica into another Guatemala. The newspapers pointed out that the culprit for the situation in Central America is U.S. imperialism. "El Debate" said: "Nine-tenths of Nicaraguan President Somoza's power relies on Washington." The newspaper pointed out: "It goes without saying who is creating chaos in Central America, who is planning and leading to the almost constant turbulence in this region."
    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 12th TASS: According to a United Press International correspondent, President Eisenhower said at a regular press conference that the U.S. government was not prepared to comment on the "dispute between Costa Rica and Nicaragua" until the special committee established by the Organization of American States had conducted an on-the-spot investigation. The President pointed out that the committee would fly from Washington to Costa Rica on January 12.
    A United Press International correspondent wrote: "President Eisenhower said that the purpose of the United States' foreign military policy is to encourage local forces that can maintain order. …He said that the United States should be prepared with light, mobile forces so that they can be sent to assist when such local forces need assistance."
    The rest of Eisenhower's remarks at the press conference were about domestic and military issues.

    乌拉圭报纸谴责美国制造中美洲的混乱局面
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社纽约十二日讯：美联社报道，哥斯达黎加政府十一日晚间宣布，从尼加拉瓜入侵的军队已经占据了哥斯达黎加北部的几个城市，并且正在向首都圣约瑟推进。
    据合众社驻圣约瑟记者报道，哥斯达黎加的义勇军在维尔·凯沙德附近同干涉军打了起来。装备机关枪的哥斯达黎加民航飞机从空中射击入侵的军队。据悉，由于这种行动，干涉军遭到了损失。
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社纽约十二日讯：据合众社记者从圣约瑟报道，哥斯达黎加总统菲格雷斯宣布从尼加拉瓜入侵的武装部队已越过边界深入到哥斯达黎加境内，占据了距哥斯达黎加首都三十五英里的居民地克维谢达。
    菲格雷斯指出：这次入侵是“准备几年的侵略”的开始。
  菲格雷斯说：干涉者使用运输机运输部队，他们的直接目的是在克维谢达地区准备着陆，把克维谢达作为扩大入侵的基地。
    菲格雷斯说：“我们准备以自己现有的一切力量给干涉者以回击。”他表示希望美洲国家组织采取迅速和有效的措施来制止武装干涉。
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社蒙得维的亚十二日讯：乌拉圭报纸在评论哥斯达黎加事件时，谴责西半球某些集团企图把哥斯达黎加变成另一个危地马拉的阴谋。报纸指出，造成中美洲这种局势的祸首就是美帝国主义。“辩论报”说：“尼加拉瓜总统索摩查的势力十分之九是依靠华盛顿的。”报纸指出：“用不着说明就可以知道，是谁造成中美洲的混乱状态，是谁策划和导致这一地区几乎连年不断的动荡局面。”
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社华盛顿十二日讯：据合众社记者报道，艾森豪威尔总统在例行的记者招待会上说，在美洲国家组织所建立的特别委员会没有进行就地调查以前，美国政府不准备评论关于
  “哥斯达黎加和尼加拉瓜之间的纠纷”的问题。总统指出，委员会将于一月十二日自华盛顿飞往哥斯达黎加。
    合众社记者写道：“艾森豪威尔总统说，美国的国外军事政策的目的是鼓励能够维持秩序的地方部队。……他说，美国应当准备好轻便的机动部队，以便一旦这种地方部队需要援助的时候，可以派去援助。”
    艾森豪威尔在记者招待会上的谈话的其余部分是关于内政问题和军事问题。
