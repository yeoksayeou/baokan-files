Following the October Socialist Revolution, Russia was a country dominated by a small-scale peasant economy. Related to this was the significant presence of handicrafts. After large-scale industry suffered severe damage during foreign armed intervention and the domestic war, the proportion of handicraft products in total industrial products increased from 33% before the revolution to 45%, becoming an important source of daily necessities for the people.

However, individual ownership still dominated handicrafts, and when handicraftsmen remain small private owners, a direct transition to socialism is impossible. It is necessary to consider their interests, adopt methods that combine their individual interests with social interests, and use methods that are as simple, acceptable, and understandable to them as possible, namely, cooperation, to attract them to participate in socialist construction.

Handicrafts and agriculture are closely linked and integrated. The development of handicrafts, especially the development of handicraft cooperatives, can increase farmers' income, activate local circulation between industry and agriculture, help revitalize agriculture, and promote the socialist transformation of agriculture. Handicraft cooperatives are one of the means of incorporating the peasant economy into the socialist economic system.

Handicraft cooperatives also attract a large amount of surplus labor to participate in labor that is beneficial to socialist construction, and fully mobilize the initiative of local economic construction.

Therefore, the development of handicrafts, especially the transformation of handicrafts through handicraft cooperatives, plays a significant role in socialist construction.

Attracting the vast number of handicraftsmen to participate in handicraft cooperatives and guiding handicrafts from small-scale production to large-scale production is generally done in two steps: first, cooperation in the field of circulation, and then cooperation in the field of production.

Why start with supply and sales?

As we know, under capitalist conditions, individual handicraftsmen must be connected with the market. Without transactions, they will lose the conditions for their existence and development. However, due to their dispersion and isolation, they inevitably depend on commercial capital and usury, suffering cruel exploitation. This is what individual handicraftsmen find most distressing. During the transition period, the proletarian state uses this point to start attracting individual handicraftsmen to take the road of cooperation. Since the proletarian state has already mastered large-scale industry, the market, and the credit system, it can gradually get individual handicraftsmen out of the exploitation of commercial capital and usury and incorporate the individual economy into the socialist economic system through supply, sales, and credit organizations. The organizations used by the proletarian state are various low-level forms of cooperatives that mainly perform the functions of supply, sales, and credit.

In the beginning, the low-level forms of cooperatives included the simplest organizations such as purchasing and marketing cooperatives, mutual credit cooperatives, and handicraft credit cooperatives. These organizations can basically be divided into two types: supply and sales, and credit. They all take care of the interests of individual handicraftsmen's private economy, treating them as sellers of handicraft products, purchasers of means of livelihood and means of production, and as debtors. By participating in these organizations, handicraftsmen can gradually get rid of the control and exploitation of commercial capital and usurers.

With the development of cooperation, the form of collaborative groups (协作社) also appeared. The collaborative group is a transitional form in the process of handicraft cooperation, developing from a low level to a high level. It is not only a union of handicraftsmen in supply and sales, but also implements a certain degree of unity in production. Here, handicraftsmen are no longer sellers of products of individual operations, but are united within a unified operating unit. The products are owned by the collaborative group, and members receive remuneration based on the quantity and quality of the products they submit (occasionally, some members' labor is carried out in the family, and under certain conditions, even includes some collective factories). With the development of labor cooperation, a certain degree of public ownership also occurs.

Although the above two forms of cooperatives have differences in the degree of development, they are basically within the scope of circulation, and handicraftsmen still exist as owners of the means of production. Under these circumstances, it is impossible to completely eliminate all the inherent weaknesses of individual handicraftsmen. Because the individual ownership of the means of production limits the expansion of production scale and hinders the adoption of advanced technology. When this ownership still exists, it is impossible to continuously improve the living standards of handicraftsmen, and the psychological habits of small producers cannot be fundamentally transformed. Therefore, these cooperatives within the scope of circulation must transition to production cooperatives, that is, to cooperative factories based on the collective public ownership of the means of production, to realize the fundamental transformation of handicraft production.

The development of low-level forms of handicraft cooperatives is preparing conditions for this transition. It cultivates the collectivist spirit of handicraftsmen, gradually improves their lives, and gradually expands the public economy. However, to finally realize this transition, it is also necessary to implement a broad division of labor in production and adopt advanced technologies in order to greatly increase labor productivity. Therefore, the development of state-owned large industries and state assistance to handicraft cooperatives are of great significance.

With the vigorous help of the proletarian state, handicraft production cooperatives have developed rapidly, and by the beginning of the Second Five-Year Plan, it had become the main form. On November 11, 1934, the Soviet government approved the new charter of the handicraft production cooperative. It stipulated that the production cooperative is a production union of handicraftsmen based on the collective ownership of the means of production, and its business activities are based on planning and economic accounting. The establishment and consolidation of production cooperatives has realized the transition from small-scale production to large-scale production, laying the foundation for the adoption of modern advanced technology.

In many areas where handicrafts are relatively developed, farmers are often also handicraftsmen. Therefore, under the conditions of the development of the collective farm movement, it is necessary to correctly resolve the relationship between collective farms and handicraft cooperatives. To this end, the Soviet government made a resolution in July 1932, stipulating that in agricultural areas where handicrafts are the main occupation and agriculture is the secondary occupation, mixed agricultural and handicraft grassroots cooperatives can be established according to the principle of voluntariness, included in the handicraft cooperative system, and accept the leadership of the handicraft cooperative federation. At the same time, collective farms were instructed to help handicraft cooperatives restore production and allocate surplus labor to handicraft cooperatives. This resolution defined the direction of development for handicraft cooperatives and ensured the smooth progress of the agricultural and handicraft cooperative movement. The purpose of establishing mixed agricultural and handicraft grassroots cooperatives is not to consolidate the medieval links between agriculture and handicrafts, but to promote the development of their specialization. Therefore, with the increasing strength of large industries and agriculture and the development of handicrafts, mixed agricultural and handicraft grassroots cooperatives gradually differentiated into handicraft cooperatives and collective farms. However, in rural areas, handicraft cooperatives and collective farms have always maintained mutual adjustment of labor and economic mutual assistance.

The gradual development of handicraft cooperatives from low level to high level is the process of the gradual completion of the socialist transformation of handicrafts. Due to the different degrees of concentration of handicrafts, the time of cooperation, and other conditions in various places, the speed of the transition is not entirely the same.

The task of the Soviet Communist Party and the government in the handicraft cooperative movement is to promote the development of handicraft cooperatives as much as possible. The Party pointed out:

"Since agricultural cooperatives and handicraft cooperatives are to unite small producers who have various individual characteristics in terms of economy and needs, they should be built according to the principles of voluntariness and economic benefit."

In order to widely attract handicraftsmen to participate in cooperatives in accordance with the principles of voluntariness and economic benefit, it is first necessary to make every effort to mobilize the initiative of handicraftsmen in the cooperative movement. Therefore, on July 7, 1921, the People's Committee issued a decree giving the working people the right to organize handicraft cooperatives and to establish joint cooperatives according to the characteristics of production and region. Later, the Party also stipulated that "each cooperative voluntarily organized has the freedom to choose various specialized cooperative forms (agriculture, handicrafts, credit, etc.)."

In order to adhere to the principle of voluntary membership, it is required that the local organs of the Party strengthen political work and give full play to the educational role of cooperative organizations to the residents. Because educating the masses with socialist ideology is indispensable to giving full play to their initiative. Lenin pointed out: The more thorough the reforms we are carrying out, the more we should raise interest in it and a conscious attitude, and the more we should convince millions, tens of millions, and more and more people of the necessity of this transformation.

In order to encourage the cooperation of small producers and make the cooperatives increasingly consolidated, the Soviet state used the economic lifeline it controlled to provide financial and economic assistance to the cooperatives. The state's assistance to low-level forms of cooperatives mainly satisfies the personal needs of handicraftsmen and the needs of cooperative circulation, prompting them to care about the improvement of their own production. Therefore, various preferential treatment and conveniences must be given to cooperatives in terms of raw material supply and product sales, the raw materials needed by handicraft cooperatives should be included in the national supply plan, and priority should be given to them when state organs and other cooperatives place orders. In order to expand the commodity circulation of handicraft cooperatives, they must be given the right to directly purchase certain raw materials and sell products locally, and encourage the export of their products, requiring state and cooperative commercial organs to reduce costs and help cooperatives improve product quality. In order to expand the influence of handicraft cooperatives on the production process of non-cooperative handicraftsmen, the supply, sales, and credit of non-cooperative handicraftsmen must also be handed over to handicraft cooperatives.

The Soviet government also used the credit system to enable small producers with weak capabilities to get rid of the control of rich peasants and usurers, regulate the scale of handicraft production, and promote their cooperation. The poor handicraftsmen, especially the handicraft cooperatives, are given loan assistance under preferential conditions. After the state transitioned to the New Economic Policy, in order to save national credit funds and strengthen the struggle against usurers, the Soviet government adopted financial assistance measures, mobilized the savings and idle funds of the working masses to invest in economic circulation, and carried out mutual assistance among workers. Therefore, the importance of developing credit cooperatives and the credit system has increased. The Credit Cooperative Regulations passed on January 24, 1922, laid the foundation for the development of a mass credit network. In February of the same year, the Consumer Cooperative Bank, in which the National Bank participated in shares, was established. Later, in order to strengthen loans to various cooperative organizations, the Consumer Cooperative Bank was reorganized into the All-Russian Cooperative Bank. In 1927, the Handicraft Credit Cooperative Regulations were also promulgated. In order to strengthen state supervision of credit, it was stipulated that various mass credit organizations would be merged into credit cooperatives in 1928 in order to effectively squeeze out usury in rural areas.

With the transition of handicraft cooperatives from low level to high level, the state's assistance has also moved from meeting the needs of cooperative circulation to meeting the needs of cooperative production. Therefore, mass credit organizations have gradually lost their need for existence, and all credit has been concentrated in the National Bank. However, the state's credit loans are still an important condition for the development and consolidation of handicraft cooperatives. The Party's resolution pointed out: "Generally speaking, the further development of agricultural and handicraft cooperatives, especially the transition from cooperatives that mainly perform the functions of commercial intermediaries to cooperatives that mainly perform the functions of production, mainly depends on the full and wide-ranging development of credit undertakings." Due to the transition to production cooperatives, short-term loans can no longer meet the needs of the production process. Therefore, a special loan system and mortgage loan method for handicraft cooperatives have been formulated, and planned loans are made according to the needs of the production process and circulation process of handicraft cooperatives. At the same time, handicraftsman cooperatives are supplied with tools and machinery and equipment under preferential conditions; equipment, factories, workshops, tools and even entire factories and enterprises not immediately used by the state are handed over to handicraft cooperatives for use by means of long-term loans or leases; and state-owned industries are instructed to provide assistance in technology and management.

The Soviet government's assistance to handicraft cooperatives in all aspects is always based on giving full play to the initiative of handicraft cooperatives and members, and mobilizing and utilizing their internal potential. In order to promote the cooperation of small producers in accordance with the principles of voluntariness and economic benefit, and at the same time make every effort to consolidate handicraft cooperatives organizationally and economically. After handicraft cooperatives have been fully developed, the Party and the government have made helping handicraft cooperatives to increasingly consolidate themselves organizationally and economically their main responsibility for leadership.

Establishing and improving the organization of the handicraft cooperative system is a necessary condition for correctly developing and consolidating the handicraft cooperative and giving full play to its initiative. However, the establishment of all levels of the handicraft cooperative system is adapted to the political and economic situation of the country, the tasks of the handicraft cooperative, the level of work development, and the conditions of cadres. In the beginning, handicraft cooperatives only merged into the work of consumer cooperative organizations and have not yet become a separate system. With the transition of the country to the period of economic construction, cooperatives have become an important tool for building socialism. It is necessary not only to accelerate the development of cooperative organizations, but also not only to regard small producers as consumers, but also to organize them as producers. Therefore, in 1922, the industrial part of the Central Federation of Consumer Cooperatives was separated to establish the All-Russian Federation of Handicraft Cooperatives, and an independent system was established. In 1928, the All-Soviet Congress of Handicraft Cooperatives was established. With the development of handicraft cooperatives, in order to improve the level of leadership and further promote their development and consolidation, more than ten All-Soviet central agencies were established separately according to production sectors in 1932. Later, in order to strengthen centralized leadership and closely connect it with the local economy, the systems of various production sectors were appropriately merged, the All-Soviet central agencies were abolished, and leadership agencies of various republics were established. However, various specialized federations are still preserved in order to strengthen specific leadership at the grassroots level. The collective ownership of the means of cooperative property by the working people determines that in the establishment of organizational institutions, the independence and democratic principles of the cooperative must be combined with the centralized leadership of the state. Therefore, the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party and the government over handicraft cooperatives has always been conditional on maintaining the independence of cooperative property and business activities. The state strengthens the centralized leadership of the handicraft cooperative system on the basis of unified planning; and relies on the role of state power, the leading position of public ownership in the national economy, and the organization of the Party in the cooperative to realize centralized leadership. At the same time, the responsibilities of upper and lower-level cooperatives are clearly divided in the handicraft cooperative system, so that the upper-level cooperatives can implement real organizational leadership, the lower-level cooperatives can give play to their initiative, and consolidate the economic accounting system of the grassroots cooperatives.

Giving play to the initiative of the members in the construction of the cooperative, strengthening the concern of the members for the cooperative, and strengthening the trust of the members in the cooperative are important conditions for consolidating the cooperative. Therefore, the Soviet Communist Party has pointed out more than once that democratic management must be earnestly implemented in the cooperative, members must be attracted to participate in the work of the cooperative, and the supervisory organs of the cooperative must be established and strengthened. At the same time, it is required that the handicraft cooperatives strengthen their business activities in order to fully meet the direct needs of the handicraftsmen in supply and sales, and strengthen their connection with them. In addition, the widespread development of socialist competition in the cooperatives, the distribution of an appropriate portion of the cooperative's profits among the members, and the encouragement of the members' labor credit to the cooperative (that is, the deferred payment of the members' labor remuneration) can also greatly increase the members' enthusiasm in production and business activities.

The improvement of financial conditions is also important for the consolidation of cooperatives. In order to increase the income of the cooperatives, so as to ensure the increase of the income of the members and the continuous growth of the public economy, in addition to making every effort to protect the property of the cooperatives from infringement and damage, the Soviet Communist Party and the government have also helped the handicraft cooperatives to streamline institutions, reduce costs, and rationally utilize material resources, so that the economic activities of the cooperatives are based on economic accounting. In order to promote the overall development and continuous consolidation of handicraft cooperatives, it is also necessary to make full use of the economic strength within the cooperative system. This requires the establishment of a basic construction fund for the handicraft cooperative system. This fund is formed by extracting an appropriate portion of the profits of the grassroots cooperatives and concentrating idle funds under the conditions of not affecting the economic activities of the grassroots cooperatives and ensuring the consolidation of the cooperative property. The function of this fund is to adjust the funds between the various grassroots cooperatives, so that the higher-level cooperatives can more systematically help the lower-level cooperatives economically and technically, so that the funds can be used rationally, and the leadership role of the higher-level cooperatives can be greatly strengthened.

It must be emphasized that the Soviet handicraft cooperative has been developed and consolidated in the continuous struggle against fake cooperatives and private merchants and speculators who have infiltrated the cooperative, and has been strengthened under the guidance of the principle of "who will defeat whom." In this regard, the Soviet Communist Party and the government have shown unlimited concern for the handicraft cooperative. In handicrafts, private capital has deep roots. In order to squeeze out private capital in small industries and eliminate the influence of private merchants on handicraftsmen, it is necessary to require the handicraft cooperatives to be continuously consolidated organizationally and economically, and to attract handicraftsmen to join the cooperatives more widely. At the same time, make every effort to strengthen the mutual coordination of various cooperatives in business and the business of supplying and selling non-cooperative handicraftsmen. Special preferential assistance should be given to departments where poor handicraftsmen are more influenced by capitalism.

Since the capitalist elements squeezed out of large-scale industry and commerce infiltrate the cooperatives in various ways, the continuous struggle against fake cooperatives has become a regular task for the consolidation and development of handicraft cooperatives. In order to carry out this struggle correctly and effectively, the Soviet government has made special resolutions and formulated policies and measures in this struggle. The resolution pointed out that all cooperatives that are impersonated by illegal elements as the initiators of cooperatives, infiltrated into electoral organs, used by capitalist elements to seek benefits for their own class, and whose business activities are contrary to socialist interests should be regarded as fake cooperatives. In order to purify the handicraft cooperatives and expose illegal elements in a timely manner, the handicraft cooperatives attract handicraftsmen who are closest to the proletariat to participate in the cooperatives by various methods, strengthen the leading influence of the basic masses of handicraftsmen in the cooperatives, and carry out mass supervision. At the same time, the government instructed local governments at all levels to supervise the handicraft cooperatives to strictly abide by the articles of association. For fake cooperatives, measures such as re-electing leaders, strengthening supervision, absorbing new members, expelling individual members, and even merging, reorganizing, or banning them are taken separately according to the composition of their members and the nature of their bad tendencies. Due to the effective implementation of these measures, the task of squeezing out private capital in small industries was completed in 1930. However, the struggle against speculators infiltrating cooperatives is still maintained as a regular task of handicraft cooperatives.

The leadership of the Party is the decisive factor for the correct development and increasing consolidation of the handicraft cooperative. The Soviet Communist Party has repeatedly pointed out that the cooperation of small producers has not alleviated the Party's responsibility for the leadership of cooperatives in the slightest. To implement the Party's policies in the cooperative movement must rely on the Party's regular leadership and organizational work. Therefore, the Party's resolution pointed out: The party organizations at all levels must transform the temporary and accidental leadership of cooperatives into regular and systematic leadership, instruct local party committees to establish party organizations in cooperatives, and send outstanding party members and economic workers to participate in cooperative work, and vigorously cultivate party and non-party cooperative work cadres. At the same time, it is required to strengthen the political work of the cooperative and fully grasp the education of the members in order to implement the Party's policies. In order to strengthen the state's economic influence on cooperatives, it is required that the state's various departments strengthen their ties with cooperatives and supervise their economic production process in a manner that is beneficial to the cooperatives under the close attention of the Party. The above measures ensure that the handicraft cooperatives are moving forward correctly along the socialist road.

    苏联怎样实现对手工业的社会主义改造
    杨枫
    十月社会主义革命后的俄国，是一个小农经济占优势的国家。与此相联系的是手工业的大量存在，大工业在外国武装干涉与国内战争中受到很大的破坏之后，手工业产品在全部工业产品中的比重由革命前的百分之三十三，增加到百分之四十五，它成为人民所需的日用品的重要来源。
    但在手工业中，仍以个体经济占优势，而当手工业者依然是小私有者时，是不能直接向社会主义过渡的。必须估计到他们的利益，按照他们的个人利益与社会利益相结合的办法，采用尽量简单的、容易为他们所接受和理解的办法，即合作化的办法，才能吸引他们来参加社会主义建设。
    手工业与农业是紧密联系与互相结合的。手工业的发展，尤其是工艺合作社的发展，能增加农民收入，活跃地方工、农业间的周转，帮助振兴农业，促进农业的社会主义改造。工艺合作社是把农民经济纳入社会主义经济体系的手段之一。
    工艺合作社还吸引着大量剩余劳动力参加有益于社会主义建设的劳动，充分发挥地方经济建设的主动性。
    因此，发展手工业，尤其是通过工艺合作社改造手工业，对于社会主义建设，具有重大的作用。
    吸引广大手工业者参加工艺合作社，引导手工业由小生产过渡到大生产，大体上通过两个步骤：首先在流通领域内进行，然后在生产领域内实行合作化。
    为什么要从供应和销售着手呢？
    我们知道，在资本主义条件下，个体手工业者必须与市场联系，没有交易就会使他们失去存在和发展的条件；但由于他们的分散性与孤立性，他们必然依存于商业资本和高利贷，遭受残酷的剥削，这就是个体手工业者最感到苦恼的地方。在过渡时期，无产阶级国家就利用这点来着手吸引个体手工业者走上合作化的道路。由于无产阶级国家已经掌握了大工业、市场和信贷制度，它就能通过供给、销售与信贷组织，来使个体手工业者逐步摆脱商业资本和高利贷的剥削，把个体经济纳入社会主义经济体系。无产阶级国家所利用的这种组织，就是以履行供、销、信贷职能为主的各种低级形式的合作社。
    在开始，低级形式的合作社曾有过采购推销社、互贷社、工艺信贷合作社等最简单的组织。这些组织基本上可以分为供销与信贷二种，它们都是照顾个体手工业者私有经济的利益，把他们作为手工业产品的出卖者、生活资料与生产资料的购买者及作为债务者的。手工业者参加了这些组织，就能逐步摆脱商业资本与高利贷者的控制与剥削了。
    随着合作化的发展，又出现了协作社的形式。协作社是手工业合作化过程中由低级向高级发展的过渡形式。它不仅是手工业者在供、销上的联合，而且已在一定程度上实行生产上的联合。在这里，手工业者已不作为个体经营的产品出卖者，而联合在统一的经营单位之内，产品已为协作社所有，社员按其所交产品的数量和质量取得报酬（间或有某些社员的劳动分散在家庭中进行，在某种条件下甚至包括某些集体工厂在内），而随着劳动协作的发展，某种程度的公有制也发生了。
    上述两种形式的合作社，虽有发展程度上的区别，但基本上都是在流通领域之内，手工业者仍作为生产资料所有者而存在。在这种情况下，就不可能最后地排除个体手工业者所固有的一切弱点。因为生产资料的个体所有制，限制生产规模的扩大，阻碍先进技术的采用。当这种所有制还存在时，手工业者生活水平就不可能不断地提高，小生产者的心理习惯也就不能得到根本改造。因此，这些流通范围内的合作社必须向生产合作社过渡，即向以生产资料集体公有为基础的合作工厂过渡，实现手工业生产的根本变革。
    低级形式工艺合作社的发展，正为这种过渡准备了条件。它培养了手工业者的集体主义精神，逐渐改善了他们的生活，逐渐扩大了公有经济。但最后实现这种过渡，还必须在生产中实行广泛分工，采用先进技术，以便大大提高劳动生产率。因而国家大工业的发展及国家对工艺合作社的帮助就具有重要的意义。
    在无产阶级国家的大力帮助下，工艺生产合作社得到迅速的发展，它到第二个五年计划初期已成为主要形式。一九三四年十一月十一日，苏联政府批准了新的工艺生产合作社的章程。其中规定了生产合作社是以生产资料集体所有为基础的手工业者生产的联合，其业务活动建立在计划和经济核算的基础上。生产合作社的建立与巩固，实现了由小生产到大生产的过渡，奠定了采用近代先进技术的基础。
    在很多手工业较发达的地区，农民常常同时又是手工业者，所以在集体农庄运动发展的条件下，就必须正确地解决集体农庄与工艺合作社之间的关系。为此，苏联政府在一九三二年七月作出决议，规定凡以手工业为主农业为副的农业区内，可按自愿原则建立工农业混合基层社，列入工艺合作社系统，并接受工艺合作社联社的领导。同时，责成集体农庄帮助工艺合作社恢复生产，将剩余劳动力分配给工艺合作社。这一决议给工艺合作社确定了发展的方向，保证了农业与手工业合作化运动的顺利进展。建立工农业混合基层社的目的并不在于巩固农业和手工业间的中世纪式的联系，而是在于促进其专业化的发展。因此，随着大工业和农业的日益强大及手工业的发展，工农业混合基层社就逐渐向工艺合作社与集体农庄两极分化。但在农村中，工艺合作社与集体农庄之间始终保持劳动力的互相调剂及经济上的互助。
    工艺合作社逐渐由低级向高级的发展过程，是手工业的社会主义改造逐渐完成的过程。由于各地手工业集中的程度、合作化的时间及其它条件的不同，其过渡的速度也并不完全一样。
    苏联共产党和政府在手工业合作化运动中的任务，就在于尽量促进工艺合作社的发展。党指出：
  “农业合作社与手工业合作社所要联合的，既然是些在经济上与需要上有着各种个人特点的小生产者，那么，它就应当根据自愿与经济利益的原则去建设。”
    为了按照自愿与经济利益的原则，广泛地吸引手工业者参加合作社，首先必须尽力发挥手工业劳动者在合作化运动中的主动性。因此，一九二一年七月七日人民委员会颁布了法令，给劳动人民以组织工艺合作社，和可以按生产与地区的特征建立联合社的权利。以后党还规定这些自愿组织起来的“每一个合作社有选择各种专门合作社形式（农业、手工业、信贷等）的自由”。
    为要坚持自愿入社的原则，就要求党的地方机关加强政治工作，并充分发挥合作社组织对居民的教育作用。因为以社会主义思想教育群众是充分发挥其主动性所不可缺少的。列宁曾指出：我们所要进行的改革越彻底，我们就越应当提高对它的兴趣与自觉态度，就越应当使几百万、几千万、越来越多的人们确信这一改造的必要。
    为了鼓励小生产者的合作化，并使合作社日益巩固，苏维埃国家利用自己掌握的经济命脉对合作社进行财政上和经济上的帮助。国家对于低级形式合作社的帮助，主要是满足手工业者的个人需要及合作社流通的需要，促使他们关心自己生产的提高，因此，必须在原料供应与产品推销方面给合作社以各种优待和便利，把工艺合作社所需的原料列入国家供给计划，在国家机关及其它合作社进行订购时给以优先的权利。为了扩大工艺合作社的商品流转，必须使他们在当地有直接采购某些原料与推销产品的权利，并鼓励其产品输出，要求国家和合作社商业机关降低费用、帮助合作社改进产品质量。为了扩大工艺合作社对非合作化手工业者生产过程的影响，必须把非合作化手工业者的供应、推销与信贷也交给工艺合作社。
    苏联政府还通过信贷制度，使能力薄弱的小生产者摆脱富农与高利贷者的控制，调节手工业生产的规模，并促进其合作化。对贫困手工业者尤其是工艺合作社则按优惠条件给以贷款的帮助。在国家向新经济政策过渡以后，为了节约国家信贷资金，加强与高利贷者的斗争，苏联政府采取财政帮助办法，动员劳动群众的储蓄和闲散资金投入经济流通，开展劳动者间的互助。因此便增加了发展信贷合作社及信贷系统的重要性。一九二二年一月二十四日通过的信贷合作社条例，为发展群众性的信贷网奠定了基础。同年二月成立了由国家银行参加股份的消费合作银行。以后为加强对各种合作社组织的贷款，又把消费合作银行改组为全俄合作银行。一九二七年，又颁布了工艺信贷合作社条例。为了加强国家对信贷的监督，规定在一九二八年将各种群众性的信贷组织合并于信贷合作社，以便有效地排挤农村中的高利贷。
    随着工艺合作社由低级向高级的过渡，国家的帮助也由满足合作社流通的需要进到满足合作社生产上的需要，因而群众性的信贷组织便逐渐失去其存在的必要，全部信贷便集中于国家银行。但国家的信用贷款仍然是工艺合作社发展和巩固的重要条件。党的决议中指出：“一般说来，农业与手工业合作社的进一步发展，特别是由以履行商业媒介职能为主的合作社过渡到以履行生产职能为主的合作社，主要取决于充分广泛地开展信贷事业。”由于向生产合作社的过渡，短期贷款已不能满足生产过程的需要，因而制订了工艺合作社专用贷款制度与抵押贷款的办法，根据工艺合作社生产过程与流通过程的需要进行有计划的贷款。同时按优惠条件供应工艺合作社以工具和机器设备；以长期贷款或租赁的方式，将国家未被即刻利用的设备、厂房、工具以至完整的工厂、企业交给工艺合作社使用；并责成国营工业在技术上与管理上给以帮助。
    苏联政府对于工艺合作社各方面的帮助，始终是以充分发挥工艺合作社和社员的主动性，动员和利用其内部潜力为基础。而为了按照自愿与经济利益的原则来促进小生产者的合作化，同时尽力在组织上经济上巩固工艺合作社。在工艺合作社得到全面发展以后，党与政府更把帮助工艺合作社在组织上经济上的日益巩固作为自己领导的主要责任。
    建立与健全工艺合作社系统的组织，对于正确地发展和巩固工艺合作社及发挥其主动性是十分必要的条件。但工艺合作社系统各级环节的建立是和国家的政治经济情况、工艺合作社的任务、工作发展的水平及干部条件相适应的。在开始，工艺合作社只是合并在消费合作社组织中工作，还没有成为单独的系统。随着国家向经济建设时期的过渡，合作社成为建设社会主义的重要工具，那就不但要加快地发展合作组织，不但要把小生产者当作消费者看待，而且还必须把他们作为生产者组织起来。因此，在一九二二年便把消费合作社中央联社中的工业部分分立出来，成立全俄工艺合作社联社，建立了独立的系统。一九二八年，全苏工艺合作社会议建立起来了。随着工艺合作社的发展，为了提高领导水平，进一步促进其发展和巩固，到一九三二年又按生产部门分别建立了十多个全苏中央机构。以后，为了加强集中领导，密切其和地方经济的联系，将各个生产部门的系统进行了适当的合并，撤销全苏中央机构，另建立各共和国的领导机构。但仍保存着各个专业联社，以便加强对基层的具体领导。合作社财产的劳动人民的集体所有制决定了在建立组织机构方面，必须使合作社的独立性、民主原则和国家的集中领导相结合。因此苏联共产党和政府对工艺合作社的领导，始终以保持合作社财产与经营活动的独立性为条件，国家则在统一计划基础上加强工艺合作社系统的集中领导；并依靠政权的作用，依靠于全民所有制在国民经济中的领导地位，依靠党在合作社中的组织，来实现集中领导。同时，工艺合作社系统中明确地划分了上下级社的职责，使上级社实行真正的组织领导，下级社能发挥主动性，巩固基层社的经济核算制。
    发挥社员在合作社建设中的主动精神，加强社员对合作社的关心，加强社员对合作社的信任，是巩固合作社的重要条件。因此苏联共产党曾不止一次地指出，在合作社内必须切实实行民主管理，吸引社员参加合作社的工作，设立和加强合作社的监督机关。同时要求工艺合作社加强业务活动，以便充分满足手工业者供销上的直接需要，加强与他们的联系。此外，在合作社内广泛地开展社会主义竞赛，以合作社利润的适当部分在社员间进行分配，奖励社员对合作社的劳务信贷（即社员劳动报酬的缓期支付）等措施，也能大大地提高社员在生产经营活动中的积极性。
    财务状况的改善对于合作社的巩固来说也是重要的。为提高合作社收益，以保证社员收入的增加，公有经济的不断增长，苏联共产党和政府除尽力保护合作社财产不受侵犯和破坏外，并帮助工艺合作社精简机构、降低费用、合理地利用物质资财，使合作社经济活动建立在经济核算的基础上。为促进工艺合作社的全面发展及不断巩固，还必须充分利用合作社系统内部的经济力量，这就必须建立工艺合作社系统的基本建设基金。这种基金是在不影响基层社经济活动，及保证合作社财产巩固的条件下，提取基层社利润的适当部分及集中闲散资金组成的，这种基金的功用，就在于调剂各基层社间的资金，便于上级社更有计划地在经济上、技术上帮助下级社，从而使资金得到合理的使用，并由此大大加强上级社的领导作用。
    必须着重指出：苏联工艺合作社是在不断地和假合作社及潜入合作社的私商与投机分子作斗争中发展和巩固起来的，是在“谁战胜谁”的原则指导下壮大起来的。在这方面苏联共产党和政府对工艺合作社表现了无限的关怀。在手工业中，私人资本有着深固的根蒂。要排挤小工业中的私人资本，消除私商对手工业者的影响，就必须要求工艺合作社在组织上经济上的不断巩固，更广泛地吸引手工业者入社。同时尽力加强各种合作社在业务上互相协调一致和对非合作化手工业者进行供应和推销的业务。对贫困手工业者受资本主义影响较强的部门给以特别优惠的帮助。
    由于大工业和商业中排挤出来的资本主义分子，以各种方式潜入合作社，所以不断地与假合作社进行斗争便成为工艺合作社得以巩固和发展的经常任务。为了正确而有效地进行这一斗争，苏联政府曾作出专门的决议，制订了在这一斗争中的政策与措施。决议指出凡被非法分子冒充合作社的发起人，混入选举机关，被资本主义分子利用合作社为自己阶级谋利益，业务活动和社会主义利益相违背的合作社都应看做假合作社。为了纯洁工艺合作社，及时揭露非法分子，工艺合作社以各种方法吸引最接近无产阶级的手工业者参加合作社，加强手工业者基本群众在合作社中的领导性的影响，并开展群众性的监督。同时政府责成各级地方政府监督工艺合作社严格地遵守章程。对于假合作社则根据其成员的成份及不良倾向的性质，分别采取改选领导、加强监督、吸收新社员、开除个别社员，以至合并、改组或取缔等办法加以处理。由于这些措施的有效执行，在小工业中排挤私人资本的任务便在一九三○年完成了。但反对投机分子潜入合作社的斗争仍作为工艺合作社的经常任务而保持着。
    党的领导是工艺合作社正确发展和日益巩固的决定性因素。苏联共产党曾再次地指出，小生产者合作化以后丝毫没有减轻党对合作社领导的责任，在合作社运动中贯彻党的政策必须有赖于党的经常领导与组织工作。因此党的决议中指出：各级党的组织对合作社必须由临时的偶然性的领导转变为经常的有系统的领导，责成各地党委在合作社中建立党的组织，并派遣优秀的党员与经济工作者参加合作社工作，大力培养党和非党的合作社工作干部。同时要求加强合作社的政治工作，充分抓紧对社员的教育，以便贯彻党的政策。为加强国家对合作社的经济影响，要求国家的各个部门加强对合作社的联系，在党的密切注视下，以对合作社有利的办法监督其经济生产过程。上述措施保证了工艺合作社沿着社会主义道路正确地前进。
