Editor's Note: We have recently received letters from readers exposing the poor quality of products from some state-owned factories. This situation not only causes economic losses to the country but has also aroused dissatisfaction among consumers. We know that the general public has always trusted products from state-owned factories, and most state-owned factories' products have indeed gained the trust of the masses due to their good quality. However, the poor quality of products from certain factories, as revealed in the reader's letters excerpted in today's newspaper, is intolerable. Although some units have already started to improve their work based on public opinion, to prevent the recurrence of such phenomena, all enterprise production units must pay constant attention, strive for excellence, and continuously improve product quality to guarantee the supply of high-quality industrial products to consumers.

Speaking of Flying Swallow Brand Raincoats Makes Me Angry
To the Editor:
The sky-blue Flying Swallow brand raincoats produced by the Northeast Fifth Rubber Factory used to sell well in industrial cities such as Anshan, Fushun, Dalian, and Benxi. However, now these raincoats have become "famous" among users for their poor quality.

People who have bought these raincoats get angry when they talk about it. When Flying Swallow brand raincoats first came on the market, people rushed to buy them with the belief in the products of state-owned factories. However, after a few months, the color of the raincoats changed, the rubber surface cracked, and then the rubber became sticky, turning them into useless items that couldn't even be worn on sunny days.

As far as I know, the raincoats produced by the Northeast Fifth Rubber Factory from September 1952 to August of last year were all of poor quality. No less than 300,000 of these raincoats were distributed to consumers, and more than 300,000 were stockpiled in warehouses. The deterioration of more than 600,000 raincoats has caused significant economic losses to the country, and at the same time, the Fifth Rubber Factory has left a very bad impression on consumers.

Glass Instruments Automatically Cracked
To the Editor:
The Heilongjiang Provincial Pharmaceutical Company ordered a batch of glass medical instruments from the Qiqihar Municipal State-Owned Xinhua Glass Factory in the second quarter of last year. The quality of this batch of glass instruments was extremely poor. Many ground-glass stoppered bottles, when properly stored, slowly and automatically "crumbled," cracking from the ground-glass joint; some other glass instruments had uneven thickness and inconsistent specifications.

The Heilongjiang Provincial Pharmaceutical Company did not know in advance that the quality of these glass bottles was poor and allocated them to pharmaceutical companies in various counties. Soon, pharmaceutical companies in various counties raised objections, and some even sent people with samples to the provincial company to negotiate for replacements. As a result, the pharmaceutical company accumulated a large number of defective products that could not be processed. Heilongjiang Provincial Pharmaceutical Company Chen Rang

Dumb Radios
To the Editor:
The staff of our unit collectively purchased more than 500 Model 502 Type A five-tube AC radios from the Nanjing Radio Factory. On September 16th of last year, the radios arrived, and they were beautiful in appearance. The staff were very happy to take them home. When listening to the radios, everyone took care to handle them carefully. Unexpectedly, before long, many radios broke down. Among the six comrades working with me, four of their six radios have become dumb radios. Out of more than 500 radios in the entire factory, one to two hundred have broken down. Comrades go home and see these radios, and they are all worried and don't know what to do with them. The Nanjing Radio Factory should be responsible for solving this problem.

Ripped Flannel Shirts After One Wear
To the Editor:
The Changchun Wholesale Station of the China General Merchandise Company allocated a batch of Tijan Brand flannel shirts produced by the Jilin Municipal State-Owned Knitting Factory to department stores in various parts of Jilin Province. Some of these flannel shirts appeared to be of good quality on the surface, but consumers found that they ripped as soon as they put them on and rushed to the department stores to return them.

After learning about this situation, the Changchun Wholesale Station contacted the knitting factory. The knitting factory said, "Seven dozens of deteriorated flannel shirts were packaged together with non-deteriorated ones due to lax inspection, and we can exchange them." The Changchun Wholesale Station relayed this information to department stores in various places. As a result, the department store in Nong'an County alone reported more than 400 defective items.

On October 15th of last year, the Changchun Wholesale Station reported this situation to the knitting factory again. The responsible cadre of the supply and marketing section of the knitting factory said in surprise, "If that's the case, then we don't know how many flannel shirts have deteriorated."

The Jilin Municipal State-Owned Knitting Factory should use this incident to examine and improve its work. China General Merchandise Company Jilin Provincial Company Lin Bin

专栏：

    编者按：我们最近收到一些读者来信，揭发某些国营工厂产品质量低劣的情况。这种情况，不仅给国家造成经济上的损失，而且已引起消费者的不满。我们知道：广大群众对国营工厂的产品一向是信任的，大部分国营工厂的产品由于质量好，也确实取得了群众的信任；但是，本报今天摘要发表的读者来信所揭发的某些工厂产品低劣的情况，却是令人不能容忍的。虽然有些单位已经开始根据群众意见，着手改进工作，但是，为了防止这类现象的继续发生，必须请各企业生产单位都能时刻注意，精益求精，不断努力提高产品质量，保证把优良的工业品供应广大消费者。

    提起飞燕牌的雨衣就生气编辑同志：
    国营东北第五橡胶厂出产的飞燕牌天蓝色雨衣，曾经畅销在鞍山、抚顺、大连和本溪等工业城市。但是，现在这种雨衣已经因为质量不好而“驰名”于广大用户间。
    买过这种雨衣的人，提起这件事就生气。当飞燕牌雨衣开始上市时，人们都以信任国营工厂的产品的心情而争相购买。可是，几个月以后，雨衣的颜色就起了变化，胶面也有了裂痕，紧跟着胶质发粘，变成晴天也不能穿的废物。
    据我所知，国营东北第五橡胶厂从一九五二年九月到去年八月所出产的雨衣都是质量不好的，这批雨衣散布到消费者手里的不下三十万件，积压在仓库的也有三十多万件。六十多万件雨衣变质给国家造成经济上的损失是很大的，同时第五橡胶厂在广大消费者中也留下了很坏的印象。 郑文卿
    玻璃器械自动裂了口编辑同志：
    黑龙江省医药公司在去年第二季度向齐齐哈尔市地方国营新华玻璃厂订购了一批玻璃的医疗器械。这批玻璃器械质量十分低劣。很多磨口瓶放得好好的，慢慢都自动“酥口”，从磨口的地方破裂了；还有一些玻璃器械厚薄不匀、规格不整。
    黑龙江省医药公司事先不知道这批玻璃瓶质量不好，分别调拨给各县医药公司使用。不久，各县医药公司纷纷提出意见，有的还派人拿着样品到省公司来交涉调换。于是医药公司积存了大批残废品无法处理。   黑龙江省医药公司　陈　让
    哑吧收音机编辑同志：
    我们单位的职工们集体向南京无线电厂购买了五百多台五零二号甲型五灯交流收音机。去年九月十六日，收音机运来了，外表美观漂亮，职工们都很高兴地拿回家去。在收听时，大家都经心地保管。不料，过不多久，很多收音机都坏了。我们一起工作的六位同志有六台收音机，其中四台已成了哑吧收音机。全厂五百多台收音机中，坏了的已有一、二百台。同志们回家看到这些收音机，都愁眉苦脸，不知怎么处理才好。南京无线电厂应该负责解决这个问题。沈阳市读者　董文广
    一穿就破的绒衣编辑同志：
    中国百货公司长春批发站把吉林市地方国营针织工厂出品的一批体健牌绒衣分拨给吉林省各地百货公司。这批绒衣中有一部分表面上看来质量似乎很好，但消费者买回去往身上一穿就裂口，纷纷到百货公司来退换。
    长春批发站了解了这个情况后，就找针织工厂交涉。针织工厂说：“有七打变质的绒衣因为检查不严，同没有变质的包装在一起了，我们可以换货。”长春批发站就转告各地百货公司，结果仅农安县百货公司一个单位所报变质绒衣的数量就有四百多件。
    去年十月十五日，长春批发站又把这个情况向针织工厂反映。针织工厂供销股负责干部很惊讶地说：“如果这样，那就不知道有多少绒衣变质了。”
    吉林市地方国营针织工厂应该通过这个事件来检查和改进工作。
