Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 16th. (TAS report from Berlin, 15th) According to the German News Agency, the Central Council of the Free German Trade Union Federation sent a telegram to the meeting of the Council and Federal Committee of the West German Trade Union Federation being held in Düsseldorf, calling for joint action to oppose the Paris Agreement. The telegram said that as long as the German working class and its trade unions work together to achieve the goals adopted at the West German Trade Union Federation Congress and the resolutions of the Federation's youth representatives' meeting against various military blocs, the realization of the Paris Agreement and the revival of German militarism can be prevented.

The telegram said: Workers throughout Germany are against the Paris Agreement. Members of the West German Trade Union Federation firmly advocate taking active action and demand a national referendum. The workers of the German Democratic Republic and the workers of West Germany all hope to restore German unity peacefully, to hold all-German elections in 1955, and to establish a European collective security system.

The telegram said: We all bear a great responsibility. We should recognize this responsibility and act together!

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 15th. Twelve thousand steelworkers at the Oberhausen steel plant, which belongs to the Heniel Concern, one of the largest steel concerns in the Ruhr region, began a 24-hour strike at 6:00 am on the 14th to protest against the general manager of this concern's attempt to restrict and abolish the workers' right to co-determination of production. The general manager of this concern, the former Nazi "Defense Economic Commissioner" Roesch, did so because he feared that the workers would refuse to manufacture munitions based on their right to co-determination of production. Therefore, the strike by the workers of the Oberhausen steel plant, like the widespread struggle against the Paris Agreement in West Germany, directly打击 the conspiracy to revive German militarism in West Germany.

Roesch's conspiracy to abolish the right of co-determination aroused the anger of the broad masses of workers. Sixteen thousand miners at the "Neuhoffnung Mine" directly under this concern and seven thousand steelworkers at the "Gutehoffnung Ironworks" also decided to strike on the 14th and 15th to protest. Six thousand workers at the steel wire factory belonging to the Oberhausen steel plant are also preparing to strike in response. In addition, representatives of various industrial trade unions attending the Oberhausen branch meeting of the West German Trade Union Federation also agreed to this combat measure and decided to prepare for a strike.

Commenting on the strike, Berlin's democratic newspapers pointed out that the strike by workers in the Ruhr region is proof that West German workers have decided to immediately launch extra-parliamentary mass action, and it is of great significance to the West German people's struggle against the Paris Agreement before the second reading of the Bonn parliament on the ratification of the Paris Agreement.

    自由德国工会联合会致电西德工会联合会
    号召全德工人采取共同行动反对巴黎协定
    鲁尔区钢铁工人罢工直接打击武装西德的阴谋
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社柏林十五日讯：据德意志通讯社报道，自由德国工会联合会中央理事会给正在杜塞尔多夫举行的西德工会联合会理事会和联邦委员会会议发出一个电报，号召采取共同行动来反对巴黎协定。电报说，只要德国工人阶级和它的工会共同努力，实现西德工会联合会代表大会上和联合会的青年代表会议上所通过的目的在反对各种军事集团的决议，那就可以阻止巴黎协定的实现和德国军国主义的复活。
    电报说：整个德国的工人都是反对巴黎协定的。西德工会联合会会员坚决主张采取积极行动，并且要求举行全民投票。德意志民主共和国的工人和西德的工人都希望以和平方式恢复德国统一，在一九五五年举行全德选举，以及建立欧洲集体安全体系。
    电报说：我们大家肩负着重大的责任。我们应该认识到这种责任，并且共同行动起来！
   【新华社柏林十五日电】鲁尔区最大的钢铁康采恩之一赫尼尔康采恩所属的奥伯豪森钢铁厂的一万二千名钢铁工人从十四日早晨六时开始举行二十四小时的罢工，抗议这个康采恩的总经理企图限制和取消工人对生产的共同决定权。这个康采恩的总经理、前纳粹“国防经济委员”罗伊希之所以如此做是因为害怕工人根据对生产的共同决定权拒绝制造军火。因此，奥伯豪森钢铁工厂工人的罢工就与目前在西德广泛展开的反对巴黎协定的斗争一样，直接打击着在西德复活德国军国主义的阴谋。
    罗伊希想取消共同决定权的阴谋引起了广大工人的愤怒。由这个康采恩直辖的“诺依霍夫农矿场”的一万六千名矿工和“古特霍夫农炼铁厂”的七千名钢铁工人也决定在十四日和十五日举行罢工，表示抗议。奥伯豪森钢铁厂所属的钢丝工厂的六千名工人也准备罢工响应。此外，参加西德工会联合会奥伯豪森分会会议的各产业工会的代表也都同意这个战斗措施，并且决定准备罢工。
    柏林民主报纸在评论这次罢工时指出：鲁尔区的工人罢工是西德工人决定立即展开议会外群众性行动的证明，它对波恩议会就批准巴黎协定进行二读前的西德人民反对巴黎协定的斗争具有重大意义。
