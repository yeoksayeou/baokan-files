    The Chinese people have been opposing the rearmament of West Germany for several years, because in the Second World War, the fascist alliance of Germany, Japan, and Italy also brought great national disasters to China. Only after a very arduous eight-year war of resistance did the Chinese people achieve victory.

    As everyone knows, the rearmament of West Germany and the rearmament of Japan are a serious threat to peace in Europe and peace in Asia. In particular, behind the rearmament of West Germany and the rearmament of Japan, there is a powerful and belligerent external force, which cannot but encourage the rapid growth of revanchism and militarism in the West and the East, thereby provoking war. Because of this, opposing the rearmament of West Germany means fighting to defend world peace, so the Chinese people have been supporting all the struggles of the people of European countries against the rearmament of West Germany for several years. When the "European Army" plan was bankrupted under the opposition of the French people, the Chinese people welcomed this victory of the French people, and also of the people of the world, with incomparable joy. We know that the people of European countries, especially the French people, have made great efforts in this movement. The Chinese people are deeply impressed by the firm spirit and powerful strength of the French people in their struggle for peace. During the Geneva Conference last year, the countless French people's delegations who visited the Chinese delegation in Geneva and conveyed the unanimous desire of the French people to stop the war in Indochina are a good example. The Chinese people express their high respect for the efforts and achievements made by the French people and the people of European countries in opposing the rearmament of West Germany.

    After the "European Army" plan went bankrupt, the warmongers, for their own bloody interests, planned the London and Paris Agreements – a new "European Army" plan. The people of European countries, especially the French people, continued to exert greater strength and demonstrated a more resolute spirit in order to oppose this new plan. This new plan violates the will of the people. Although it was approved by the British Parliament, and was also approved by the French National Assembly with a very small majority after twists and turns, the people of European countries will never approve it. We believe that for the peaceful reunification of Germany, the German people will inevitably unite further and fight to defeat the London and Paris Agreements; the French people will also inevitably continue to work hard to finally defeat the London and Paris Agreements, whose legislative procedures have not yet been completed.

    The people of European countries are unremittingly continuing to fight against the rearmament of West Germany and for a European collective peace, and I would like to express my full support on behalf of the 600 million people of China. Peace is the belief of us Chinese people. The Chinese people's support for the European people's struggle for peace is by no means just a promise, but a vow. I would like to ask our European friends to accept the sincere support of us Chinese people. We Chinese people have the full strength to fulfill our vow of this support, and are willing to closely cooperate with you to pay out this strength. The struggle for a European collective peace will surely achieve final victory! (Xinhua News Agency)

    十八日在世界和平理事会常委会扩大会议上
    刘长胜关于反对重新武装西德的发言
    中国人民几年来一直反对重新武装西德，因为在第二次世界大战中，德、日、意法西斯联盟也给中国带来了很大的民族灾难，只是经过了非常困苦的八年抗战，中国人民才得到了胜利。
    大家都知道，重新武装西德与重新武装日本是对欧洲和平和亚洲和平的严重威胁，特别是站在重新武装西德和重新武装日本之后的，是一个强大而又好战的外来势力，这就不能不鼓励西方与东方的复仇主义和军国主义迅速成长，从而挑起战争。因为这样，反对重新武装西德就意味着是为保卫世界和平而斗争，所以中国人民几年来就一直支持欧洲各国人民反对重新武装西德的一切斗争。当“欧洲军”计划在法国人民反对下遭到破产的时候，中国人民曾以无比的快慰欢迎这一个法国人民的、也是世界人民的胜利。我们知道欧洲各国人民、特别是法国人民，在这个运动中是尽了很大的努力的。法国人民为和平而斗争的坚定精神和强大力量，中国人民是有很深刻的印象的。去年日内瓦会议时期，到日内瓦访问中国代表团传达法国人民一致要求停止印度支那战争的意愿的无数的法国人民代表团，就是很好的例子。中国人民对法国人民和欧洲各国人民反对重新武装西德所作的努力和已得的成就，表示崇高的敬意。
    在“欧洲军”计划破产之后，好战分子为了自己的血腥利益，又策划了伦敦和巴黎协定——新的“欧洲军”计划。欧洲各国人民、特别是法国人民，为了反对这一新计划，继续发挥了更大的力量，表现了更坚决的精神。这个新计划违反人民的意志，尽管它在英国议会获得了批准，在法国国民议会经过曲折之后也以极少的多数获得了批准，但是欧洲各国人民是决不会加以批准的。我们相信，为了德国的和平统一，德国人民必然会更进一步团结起来，为击败伦敦和巴黎协定而斗争；法国人民也必然会继续努力为最后击败立法手续尚未完备的伦敦和巴黎协定而斗争。
    欧洲各国人民不懈地继续为反对重新武装西德和争取欧洲集体和平而斗争，我愿意代表全中国六亿人民表示全力的支持。和平就是我们中国人民的信念。中国人民对欧洲人民为和平而斗争的支持，决不单是一个允诺，而是一个誓约。我要请欧洲的朋友们接受我们中国人民的衷心的支持，我们中国人民有着履行自己的誓约的充分的这种支持的力量，并且愿意和你们密切配合起来支付出这种力量。争取欧洲集体和平的斗争一定会得到最后的胜利！（新华社）
