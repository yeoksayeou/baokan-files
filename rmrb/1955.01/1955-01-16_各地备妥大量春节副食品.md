Various Localities Prepare Large Quantities of Spring Festival Non-staple Foods

The Spring Festival is approaching. State-owned food companies in various localities have prepared abundant non-staple foods for consumers. The amount of pork prepared for supply during the Spring Festival this year in six major cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Shenyang, will increase by 12% compared to the same period last year. The amount of beef and mutton prepared for supply will increase even more; for example, the amount of beef and mutton that Beijing prepares for supply will increase by approximately 40% compared to the same period last year. In Anshan, the steel capital, 6,000 pigs and 1,000 head of cattle will be supplied during the Spring Festival this year. Compared with the actual consumption during the Spring Festival last year, the supply of pork will increase by more than 33%. Various localities have also made preparations for the supply of pork in small and medium-sized cities and rural areas.

Various localities have also made sufficient preparations for fish, fruits, eggs, and other items. The supply of frozen and fresh fish in Beijing will increase by 93.86% compared to the Spring Festival last year; citizens in Wuhan will be able to eat an average of more than three catties of fish and shrimp during the festival. State-owned food companies in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Shenyang have stockpiled nearly 15 million catties of tangerines, bananas, and apples. Winter is precisely the season when eggs are scarce, and the food company system has specially prepared frozen eggs, egg powder, and reprocessed eggs for residents of several large cities. (Yě Fū)

    各地备妥大量春节副食品
    春节就要到了。各地国营食品公司已经为消费者准备了丰富的副食品。北京、天津、上海、武汉、广州、沈阳等六大城市，今年春节期间准备供应猪肉的数量，将比去年同时期增加百分之十二；牛羊肉准备供应的数量增加更多，北京市准备供应牛羊肉的数量就比去年同时期增加百分之四十左右。在钢都鞍山，今年春节期间将要供应六千头猪和一千头牛，同去年春节期间实际消费量比较，猪肉的供应量将增加百分之三十三以上。中小城市和农村供应猪肉的工作，各地也都作了准备。
    鱼类、水果、蛋品等，各地也作了充分准备。北京市冻鱼和鲜鱼的供应量，将比去年春节期间增加百分之九十三点八六；武汉市市民平均每人可在节日吃到三斤多鱼虾。北京、天津、上海、武汉、广州、沈阳等市的国营食品公司，储备了近一千五百万斤的桔柑、香蕉和苹果。冬天，正是缺蛋的季节，食品公司系统特别为几个大城市的居民准备了冰蛋、蛋粉和再制蛋。　（野夫）
