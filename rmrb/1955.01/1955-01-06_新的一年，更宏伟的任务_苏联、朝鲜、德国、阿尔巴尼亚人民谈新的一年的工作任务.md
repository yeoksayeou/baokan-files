New Year, More Ambitious Tasks
People of the Soviet Union, North Korea, Germany, and Albania Discuss New Year's Work Tasks

    Soviet Union
    Soviet people have been giving interviews to TASS reporters, discussing their labor achievements in 1954 and their plans for 1955.

    Ni. Sichev, Captain of Excavator Team No. 572 at the Stalingrad Hydropower Station construction site, said: "In 1954, the construction of the Stalingrad Hydropower Station entered a new stage, with the start of the power plant construction. Our excavator operators and mud-pump operators have removed millions of cubic meters of soil when building the foundation pit for the power plant building. The hydropower station's annual construction plan for 1954 was completed almost a month ahead of schedule. Our team of excavator operators began working on the tasks stipulated in the 1955 plan two months ago. Now, the earthwork for the hydropower station's foundation pit is coming to an end, and soon we will begin erecting steel frames and pouring concrete. The amount of concrete planned to be poured at the construction site this year is more than the total amount of concrete poured in the years since the hydropower station's construction began."

    A. Gnilitsky, Director of the Slavyansky State Grain Farm, said that 1954 brought us much joy. Our farm was established on the steppes of Northern Kazakhstan this spring. During this year, we reclaimed more than 20,000 hectares (1 hectare equals 15 mu) of virgin land. In 1955, we will continue to reclaim virgin land. All reclaimed land will be planted with wheat. We plan to deliver at least 2 million poods (1 pood equals 32.76 jin) of wheat to the state before September 1, 1955.

    Ru. Tokhtobayev, Chairman of the Stalin Collective Farm in the Uzbek Republic, said that in 1954, our farm's grain output increased, and our public accumulation fund increased by more than 18 million rubles. The farm's cotton harvest was also very good, with a yield of three tons of seed cotton per hectare on 1,775 hectares of land. In the past three years, as a result of reclaiming wasteland, we have expanded the cotton-growing area in central Fergana by more than a quarter. In 1955, we will continue to redouble our efforts to reclaim the grasslands of central Fergana.

    Jan Peive, President of the Latvian Republic Academy of Sciences, said: "In 1954, our republic's scientists achieved many successes. The Physics Institute of the Republic Academy of Sciences has created and promoted new automatic control methods in industry. The research work of the Institute of Power and Electrical Technology has made it possible for us to design new machines for cold welding metals. Our biologists have studied the composition of trace elements in Latvian soil, which has created conditions for increasing the yield per unit area of crops. In addition, the Institute of Economics, Language, and Literature has also published many important scientific works. In 1955, Latvian scientists are prepared to further expand the scope of research in theoretical physics, dynamics, chemistry, biology, medicine, and pediatric medicine."

    Ma. Melnikova, a doctor from Lisen Prefecture, said: "In 1954, I experienced two unforgettable events. The first was that I received the degree of Candidate of Medical Sciences, and the second was that I was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labor for my long-term medical work. To date, I have been a doctor for 28 years, 25 of which have been devoted to eradicating malaria. My doctoral thesis is about the elimination of malaria. Now, we doctors in Lisen Prefecture have all the necessary conditions to carry out effective work. I hope that in 1955, I can achieve new successes in safeguarding the people's health and prolonging their lives."

    North Korea
    On the basis of successfully completing the 1954 People's Economic Restoration and Development Plan, the Korean people have formulated the 1955 People's Economic Restoration and Development Plan, stipulating that many aspects of the people's economy will exceed pre-war levels. The 1955 People's Economic Restoration and Development Plan stipulates that by the end of 1955, the total industrial output will be 2.4% higher than the originally planned total industrial output for 1956. This output is equivalent to 159.5% of the 1949 level.

    The 1955 heavy industry production target is projected to be 132.6% of 1949. Heavy industry focuses on supplying all the means of production necessary to strengthen the restoration and construction of basic industrial facilities, to promote the general restoration and development of the people's economy; to ensure the rapid development of the daily necessities industry, the food industry, and the rural economy, thereby improving the people's lives; and to promote the development of the fishing industry.

    The plan for the chemical industry and the building materials industry is 33.9% higher than the original 1956 target.

    In terms of light industry, this year's output will be 204.6% of the 1949 output.

    According to the main objectives of the Three-Year Plan and the tasks stipulated in the decision of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party last November, this year's rural economic plan has stipulated that the sown area will be expanded by 130,000 chongbo (approximately 1 hectare per chongbo), increasing the utilization rate of land by 26.4%. This year's farming work will be further mechanized.

    In the transportation sector, this year's transportation volume will far exceed that of 1954, with railway transportation increasing by more than 14.5%.

    This year's education plan calls for the total number of classes to exceed the 1949 level by 29.6%, and the number of students to increase by 7.8% compared to 1949.

    In addition, many hospitals, day care centers, sanatoriums, theaters, and cinemas will be built and expanded to meet the people's needs in education, culture, and public health.

    Due to the rapid development of the people's economy in 1955, people's incomes will increase by 40% compared to 1954.

    German Democratic Republic
    On January 3, the working people of the German Democratic Republic held brief gatherings on the first working day of the New Year, guaranteeing to work hard to meet the production tasks of the final year of the Five-Year Plan.

    The workers of the Berlin clothing factory guaranteed at the meeting to make 1955 a year of producing the best quality and saving the most raw materials. The workers of the Berlin motorcycle repair factory discussed the work tasks for 1955 at the meeting and decided to increase production by 20%. Salespersons from state-owned stores and cooperatives on Stalin Avenue also held meetings to discuss work plans and decided to write letters to store workers in West Berlin, calling on them to fight against West German rearmament and strive for the unification of the country.

    The workers of the No. 5 blast furnace of the Stalin Steel Plant in Stalinstadt decided to overproduce five tons of pig iron per day in January, eight tons per day in February, and ten tons per day in March, for a total overproduction of 689 tons in the first quarter. This increased production guarantee has been echoed by other blast furnace workers.

    Albania
    S. Koleka, Chairman of the Albanian State Planning Commission, told the Albanian Telegraph Agency that the main tasks of the Albanian 1955 National Plan are: to further improve the material and cultural living standards of urban and rural residents, to ensure the steady and balanced development of various economic sectors, and to greatly increase agricultural production in order to eliminate the imbalance between the development speed of industry and agriculture. In 1955, industrial output will increase by 15% compared to 1954, of which mining industrial output will increase by 22%, state-owned enterprise output will increase by 13%, local industrial output will increase by 20%, and production cooperative output will increase by 10%.

    新的一年，更宏伟的任务
    苏联、朝鲜、德国、阿尔巴尼亚人民谈新的一年的工作任务
    苏　联
    苏联人民纷纷向塔斯社记者发表谈话，谈他们一九五四年的劳动成就和一九五五年的计划。
    斯大林格勒水电站工地五百七十二号挖掘机机手队队长尼·西契夫说：一九五四年斯大林格勒水电站的建筑工程进入了新的阶段，开始建筑发电厂。在建筑发电厂房的基坑时，我们挖掘机机手和吸泥机机手已经移除了几百万公方的泥土。水电站的一九五四年全年建筑计划差不多提前一个月完成。我们这一队挖掘机机手在两个月以前就已经开始做一九五五年计划所规定的工作。现在，水电站基坑的土方工程将要结束，不久就要开始竖立钢架和浇灌混凝土。今年工地上计划浇灌的混凝土，比水电站开工兴建以来的几年中所浇灌的混凝土的总和还要多。
    斯拉文斯基国营谷物农场场长阿·格尼利茨基说，一九五四年给我们带来了很多欢乐。我们的农场是今年春天在北哈萨克草原上建立起来的。在这一年中，我们开垦了两万多公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）的生荒地。在一九五五年，我们还要继续开垦生荒地。全部开垦好的土地将种上小麦。我们计划在一九五五年九月一日以前至少交给国家二百万普特（每普特合三二点七六市斤）的小麦。
    乌兹别克共和国斯大林集体农庄主席鲁·托赫托拜耶夫说，一九五四年，我们农庄的谷物产量增加了，我们的公积金增加了一千八百多万卢布。农庄的棉花收成也很好，在一千七百七十五公顷土地上每公顷收获了三吨籽棉。在过去三年中，由于开垦荒地的结果，我们已经把弗尔干纳中部的植棉区扩大了四分之一以上。在一九五五年，我们将继续加倍努力来开垦弗尔干纳中部的草原。
    拉脱维亚共和国科学院院长扬·佩维说：在一九五四年，我们共和国的科学家获得了很多成绩。共和国科学院物理研究所已经创造出并且在工业中推广了新的自动操纵方法。电力和电气技术研究所进行的研究工作，使我们有可能设计冷焊金属的新机器。我们的生物学家已经研究出了拉脱维亚土壤中所含的微量原素的成分，这就为提高农作物的单位面积产量创造了条件。此外，经济、语言和文学研究所也出版了不少重要的科学著作。在一九五五年，拉脱维亚科学家准备进一步扩大理论物理学、动力学、化学、生物学、医学和小儿科医学的研究范围。
    利森州的医生玛·麦尔尼科娃说：一九五四年，我经历了两件使我不能忘记的事。第一件是我得到了医学候补博士的学位，第二件是我因长时期从事医学工作而获得了劳动红旗勋章。到现在为止，我做医生已经二十八年了，其中有二十五年从事消灭疟疾的工作。我的学位论文就是谈消除疟疾的问题的。现在，我们利森州的医生已经有了进行有效的工作的一切必要条件。我希望在一九五五年，能够在保障人民身体健康和延长寿命方面获得新的成就。
    朝　鲜
    朝鲜人民在胜利完成一九五四年人民经济恢复发展计划的基础上，制定了一九五五年人民经济恢复发展的计划，规定人民经济的许多方面都将超过战前水平。一九五五年人民经济恢复发展计划规定，到一九五五年年底，全部工业产量要比原来计划的一九五六年全部工业产量高百分之二点四。这个产量相当于一九四九年水平的百分之一百五十九点五。
    一九五五年的重工业生产指标预定是一九四九年的百分之一百三十二点六。重工业着重于供应加强恢复和建设基本工业设施所必需的一切生产工具，以促进人民经济的普遍恢复和发展；保证日用品工业、食品工业和农村经济的迅速发展，从而改善人民的生活；并促进渔业的发展。
    化学工业和建筑材料工业的计划比原定一九五六年的指标还要高百分之三十三点九。
    在轻工业方面，今年的产量将是一九四九年产量的百分之二百零四点六。
    根据三年计划的主要目标和朝鲜劳动党中央委员会去年十一月全体会议决定中所规定的任务，今年的农村经济计划已规定把播种面积扩大十三万町步（每町步约合一公顷），使土地的利用率增加百分之二十六点四。今年的耕种工作将进一步实行机械化。
    在运输部门，今年的运输量将远远超过一九五四年，其中火车运输量将提高百分之十四点五以上。
    今年的教育计划，在班次的总数上要比一九四九年的水准超过百分之二十九点六，在学生的人数方面要比一九四九年增加百分之七点八。
    此外，还将建造和扩建许多医院、日托所、疗养所、剧场和电影院等，以便满足人民在教育、文化和公共卫生方面的需要。
    由于一九五五年的人民经济以这种速度向前发展，人民收入将比一九五四年增加百分之四十。
    民主德国
    一月三日，民主德国各地劳动人民在新年的第一个工作日举行简短集会，保证努力工作迎接五年计划最后一年的生产任务。
    柏林服装工厂的职工在集会上保证使一九五五年成为生产最优良、原料最节约的一年。柏林摩托修理工厂的职工在会上讨论了一九五五年的工作任务，并决定提高生产百分之二十。斯大林大街的国营商店和合作社的售货员也都开会讨论了工作计划，并决定给西柏林的商店职工写信，号召他们为反对西德重新武装、争取国家的统一而斗争。
    斯大林斯塔特斯大林钢铁工厂第五高炉的工人决定在一月份每天超额生产生铁五吨，二月份每天八吨，三月份每天十吨，在第一季度内共超额生产六百八十九吨。这一增产保证已得到其他高炉工人的响应。
    阿尔巴尼亚
    阿尔巴尼亚国家计划委员会主席斯·科列加对阿尔巴尼亚通讯社记者说，阿尔巴尼亚一九五五年国家计划的主要任务是：进一步提高城乡居民的物质和文化生活水平，保证各经济部门稳步和均衡的发展，大大增加农业生产以便消灭工业和农业发展速度不平衡的现象。一九五五年的工业产量将比一九五四年增加百分之十五，其中采矿工业产量将增加百分之二十二，国营企业产量将增加百分之十三，地方工业产量将增加百分之二十，生产合作社产量将增加百分之十。　（据新华社讯）
