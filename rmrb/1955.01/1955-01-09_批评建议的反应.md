Responses to Criticism and Suggestions

    Beijing Improves Vegetable Supply Work

    The reader's letter page on November 14th of last year criticized the problems in Beijing's vegetable supply work, which greatly helped our work. The following improvements have now been made:

    One, we have strengthened vegetable storage work. In order to ensure the supply of vegetables to the people of the capital during the winter and spring seasons, we have newly built thirty earthen cellars outside Guang'anmen, and we maintain a certain amount of vegetables at all times to adjust to market needs. We have also mobilized all staff to do a good job in winter cold protection and warmth preservation.

    Two, we have strengthened the political and ideological education of vegetable station workers. We have decided to conduct a general education and training for the staff of the vegetable stations, starting in January in batches and rotating shifts.

    Three, we will expand the work of signing joint contracts with agricultural production cooperatives. On November 20th, we convened a meeting of persons in charge of vegetable operations from consumer cooperatives in urban areas to promote the experience of direct meetings between producers and sellers. Now all consumer cooperatives have contacted larger production cooperatives in the suburbs to implement direct meetings between producers and sellers. According to the current situation, about 100,000 jin of vegetables are directly delivered from production cooperatives to consumer cooperatives every day.

    In order to do a good job in the supply and marketing of vegetables in Beijing and further improve business management, we have strengthened the leadership of the Vegetable Management Department.

    Strengthening Education for Grain Purchasing Personnel

    A letter from the Supervisory Office of the Grain Department of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region: The criticism on the "Reader's Letter Page" on December 5th last year regarding the phenomenon of some grain purchasing personnel in Inner Mongolia hastily pricing grain is very correct. Last year, the western region of Inner Mongolia implemented the policy of "inspecting grades, assessing levels, and pricing according to grades" for the first time. Therefore, due to insufficient experience, poor technical conditions, and the fact that some grain purchasing personnel were not responsible for their work, the phenomenon of hasty pricing occurred, affecting farmers' enthusiasm for selling grain. In order to correct this phenomenon, in addition to instructing the relevant grain depots to criticize and educate the inspection personnel and informing the entire region to learn from this lesson, we have also decided to strengthen the education of grain purchasing personnel, stipulating that standard grain samples should be publicly displayed and the public should be involved in grading and assessing levels in order to improve work.

    Correcting the Work Style of Shifting Responsibility

    A letter from the Business Bureau of the Ministry of Railways: The criticism published on the "Reader's Letter Page" on December 12th last year regarding our bureau's erroneous handling of the case of changing the destination of sugar is correct, and we sincerely accept it. A truckload of sugar sent by the Wuhan Department Store Procurement and Supply Station at Hankou Station caused a round trip, and the responsibility lies with the railway. The round-trip freight between Meihekou and Shenyang should not be borne by the cargo owner. This matter should have been the responsibility of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration, and the Harbin Railway Administration should have been notified to refund the money. However, after receiving the cargo owner's opinions, the two administrations shirked responsibility to each other, resulting in official documents going back and forth, and the problem remained unresolved for a long time. After the shipping unit reported the situation to our bureau, our bureau did not humbly listen to the cargo owner's opinions, analyze the facts objectively and carefully, and immediately stop the irresponsible attitude of the two administrations and return the overcharged freight to the cargo owner; instead, it unilaterally believed that since the goods had been changed to Dalian, freight should be collected according to the actual mileage transported. It was not until the Ministry of Supervision pointed out our mistake that we realized that our past handling was inappropriate. We are determined to learn from this case, correct our way of thinking and working attitude, and take measures to prevent similar bad habits of shifting responsibility from continuing to occur in various administrations.

    Tumen Land Transport Company Prepares to Adjust Surplus Personnel

    On November 8th of last year, this newspaper received a letter from a cadre of the Tumen Branch of the China Land Transport Company, reflecting that since the company was established in 1953, it has often had insufficient tasks, and the forty cadres could not average two hours of work per person per day, and most of the time they had nothing to do. However, the company's leadership did not actively try to change this situation. The reader suggested that the superior leadership organs investigate the situation and transfer the surplus personnel to other units with more work. After this issue was forwarded by this newspaper to the China Land Transport Company of the Ministry of Foreign Trade for investigation, the China Land Transport Company believes that the opinions reflected by the reader are correct. In the past, they did not proactively put forward opinions to the Northeast Foreign Trade Bureau, nor did they reasonably organize, adjust, and use labor force according to the seasonal characteristics of the work of the Tumen Branch, resulting in undue losses to the country, for which they should bear certain responsibility. Regarding the surplus personnel of the Tumen Branch, they are prepared to consult with the local Foreign Trade Bureau, appropriately transfer a portion of them, and, according to the busy and slack seasons, prepare to transfer a portion of the surplus personnel to the Manzhouli Branch to assist in their work.

专栏：批评建议的反应

    批评建议的反应
    北京市改进蔬菜供应工作
    去年十一月十四日读者来信专页批评北京市蔬菜供应工作中存在的问题，对我们的工作给予了很大帮助。现在已经作了下列改进：
    一、加强了蔬菜保管工作。为在冬春两季保证对首都人民的蔬菜供应，我们已经在广安门外新建土窖三十个，经常保持一定数量的蔬菜，随时调剂市场需要。并动员全体工作人员作好冬季防寒保暖工作。
    二、加强对菜站职工的政治思想教育工作。我们已决定对菜站的工作人员进行一次普遍教育和训练，自一月份开始分批轮训。
    三、扩大同农业生产合作社签订结合合同工作。在十一月二十日召开了城区各消费社经营蔬菜的负责人会议，推广产销直接见面的经验。现在各消费社都已经同郊区较大的生产合作社接洽，实行产销直接见面。按目前情况，每天约有十万斤蔬菜由生产合作社直接送到了消费社。
    为了作好北京市的蔬菜供销工作，进一步改善经营管理，我们已经加强了蔬菜经理部的领导。
    加强对购粮人员的教育
    内蒙古自治区人民政府粮食部监察室来信：去年十二月五日“读者来信专页”上批评内蒙地区某些购粮人员草率论价的现象，是十分正确的。去年内蒙西部地区初次实行“验等评级，分等论价”的政策，因此，经验不足，技术条件较差，加上部分购粮人员对工作不负责任，以致产生草率论价的现象，影响了农民的售粮热情。为了纠正这种现象，我们除责成有关粮库对检验人员进行批评教育，通报全区引为教训外，并决定加强对购粮人员的教育，规定将粮食标准样品公开陈列，吸收群众参加评级验等，以便改进工作。
    纠正推诿责任的作风
    铁道部商务局来信：去年十二月十二日“读者来信专页”刊载了读者对我局错误地处理砂糖变更到站案件的批评是正确的，我们诚恳地接受。原武汉百货采购供应站在汉口车站发出的砂糖一车造成折返运送，其责任属于铁路，梅河口沈阳间往返运费就不应再由货主负担。这件事情理应由郑州铁路管理局负责，并通知哈尔滨铁路管理局退款。但是两个管理局在接到货主意见后，互相推诿责难，以致公文往返，问题长期不得解决。当发货单位把情况向我局反映后，我局没有虚心地听取货主意见，认真地、客观地分析事实经过，立即制止两个管理局的不负责任态度，将多收运费退回货主；却片面地认为货物既经变更至大连，就应按照实际运送里程补收运费。直到监察部指出了我们的错误后，我们才认识到过去处理不当。我们决心从这个案件中吸取教训，端正我们的思想方法和工作态度，并采取措施防止各管理局继续发生类似的互相推诿责任的恶劣作风。
    图们陆运公司准备调整多余人员
    去年十一月八日本报接到中国陆运公司图们分公司一个干部来信，反映这个公司从一九五三年成立以后，经常任务不足，四十个干部平均每天每人做不了两个钟头的工作，大部分时间都没事做。但公司领导上对这一情况并未积极设法改变。读者建议上级领导机关查清情况后将多余的人员输送到其他工作多的单位去。这个问题经本报转请对外贸易部中国陆运公司调查后，中国陆运公司认为读者所反映的意见是正确的，过去他们没有主动向东北外贸局提出意见，也没有根据图们分公司工作有季节性的特点合理的组织、调剂、使用劳动力，以致给国家造成了不应有的损失，是应负一定责任的。对于图们分公司的多余人员，准备和当地对外贸易局商洽，适当调出一部分外，并根据季节性任务的忙闲，准备抽调一部分多余人员到满洲里分公司去协助工作。
