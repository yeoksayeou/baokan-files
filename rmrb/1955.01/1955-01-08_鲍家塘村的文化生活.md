    Baojiatang Village's Cultural Life
    Cheng Peng
    The forty-three households in Baojiatang Village, Beishan Township, Duchang County, Jiangxi Province, have all joined agricultural production cooperatives. With the development of production, cultural life has also gradually become richer. Here, there are already people's schools, blackboard newspapers, libraries, mountain song groups, amateur theater troupes, magic lanterns, radios, and loudspeakers.
    In the past, there wasn't a single literate person in the village. Now, young people can attend people's schools to learn culture. Xu Jihao had never attended school for a single day, but now he can recognize about two thousand characters. He enjoys reading passages from newspapers and books to others, and he is even happier when someone asks him to write a letter for them. Xu Shengsong, the deputy director of the agricultural production cooperative, was originally illiterate, but now he can explain to the members the reasons for taking the socialist road, as well as agricultural techniques and the use of chemical fertilizers.
    In the past, under the oppression and exploitation of landlords, the people of Baojiatang Village could not afford to dig wells, and the entire village shared one pond for drinking and other uses. People suffered from illness and pain year after year. Although they sincerely prayed to gods and Buddhas, people still died every year. Now, they all understand that drinking unhygienic water easily causes illness. They have dug a new drinking water pond, improved the village's internal and external environmental hygiene, eliminated sources of disease, and also improved labor efficiency.
    Playing basketball has become a favorite activity of all young and middle-aged people in the village. During breaks, young men and women practice playing ball on the court. Xu Jiayang, a seventy-two-year-old farmer, said, "When we were young, we were either sick or secretly gambling. Now it's great, young people exercise whenever they have free time, it's truly a new atmosphere in the new society."
    Baojiatang Village has designated the fifteenth of each month as the village's cultural and entertainment activity day. On this day, nearby farmers come to participate as if attending a fair. Some sing, some tell stories, young men and women dance, and the amateur theater troupe performs programs that everyone likes.
    Every evening, Baojiatang Village is filled with beautiful music from the radio and the day's domestic and international news. Film projection teams also frequently show movies here.

    鲍家塘村的文化生活
    程鹏
    江西都昌县北山乡鲍家塘村的四十三户农民都已参加了农业生产合作社。随着生产的发展，文化生活也逐渐丰富起来。这里已有了民校、黑板报、图书室、山歌小组、业余剧团、幻灯、收音机、广播筒。
    从前，村子里没有一个识字的人，现在青年人都能上民校学文化。徐季灏原来没上过一天学，现在能认识两千来字。他最喜欢给别人读一段报，念两页书，谁要是找他代写封信，他就更高兴了。农业生产合作社副社长徐声颂原来是个文盲，现在能给社员讲走社会主义道路的道理，讲农业技术和化学肥料的使用。
  　过去，鲍家塘村的人民，在地主压迫剥削下，因为拿不出钱打井，全村人吃水用水，共用一口塘。人们常年在疾病痛苦中，虽然诚心诚意地求神拜佛，还是年年死人。现在，他们都懂得吃水不卫生，容易生病。他们新打了一口吃水塘，改进了村内外环境卫生，杜绝了病源，劳动效率也提高了。
    打篮球已成为全村青壮年喜爱的活动。休息时，青年男女就在球场上练习打球。七十二岁的老农民徐家扬说：“我们年青时，不是生病，就是偷着去赌博。现在可好，青年人一有空就锻炼身体，真是新社会的新风气。”
    鲍家塘村订每月十五日为全村的文化娱乐活动日。在这一天，附近的农民，像赶集会似的，都来参加。有的唱歌、有的讲故事，姑娘、小伙子跳着舞，业余剧团也演出为大家所喜欢的节目。
    每天傍晚，鲍家塘村到处洋溢着从收音机播出的优美的音乐和当天国内外新闻。电影队也经常在这儿放映电影。
