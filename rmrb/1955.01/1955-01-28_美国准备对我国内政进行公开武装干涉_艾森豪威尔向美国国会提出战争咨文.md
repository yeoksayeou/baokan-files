Xinhua News Agency, January 27th: Washington - Just as the United States was widely spreading talk of a "UN-mediated ceasefire in Taiwan," US President Eisenhower submitted a message to Congress on January 24 regarding the "situation developing in the Taiwan Strait." He requested Congressional authorization to use US armed forces to openly interfere in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan, Penghu, and China's coastal islands and to launch direct armed aggression against the Chinese mainland. This is a serious step by the US aggression clique to blatantly interfere in China's internal affairs, openly threaten aggression, and prepare for a new war. It is also a major war conspiracy behind the smoke screen of a so-called "ceasefire" that threatens peace in Asia and the world.

In his message, Eisenhower made the most shameless and malicious attacks on the just cause of the Chinese people to liberate their own territory. He insisted that the Chinese people's exercise of their sovereignty and liberation of Taiwan and Penghu, occupied by the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, had some kind of "aggressive purpose" and "threatened" the "security" of the United States, which is separated by the Pacific Ocean and more than 10,000 kilometers from Taiwan. Eisenhower also tried his best to distort the facts, saying that the liberation of Taiwan "would greatly upset the existing balance of moral, economic, and military forces" and "create a gap in the island chain in the Western Pacific," undermining the "security structure." He described the US occupation of Chinese territory in Taiwan and preparations for open armed intervention against the Chinese people as "ensuring US security" and "for the sake of peace."

Despite Eisenhower's use of many hypocritical words of "peace" and "defense" in his message, the actions he requested Congress to authorize completely exposed that the US government is carrying out and further arranging thorough steps for a war of aggression against the Chinese people. He first announced that his predecessor, President Truman's order to send the US Seventh Fleet to occupy Taiwan after launching the Korean War in 1950 would remain in effect, and said, "All these military activities and related activities will continue." Then, using the excuse of the "very critical" situation, he asked Congress to "immediately participate" in the measures that the US government is actively arranging to carry out armed intervention against the Chinese people "with concrete resolutions." He clamored that the US government is prepared to take "any military action necessary" to achieve the purpose of interfering in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan. He said that the actions the United States is prepared to take are "varied," and among the actions he mentioned included: taking military action against "any concentration or use" of the Chinese People's military forces, exercising the war powers granted by Congress for "part of an offensive or its definite preparatory steps" against Taiwan and Penghu, and helping to "redeploy and consolidate" the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops in Taiwan. He also stated that the exercise of his war powers for all "closely related locations and actions" that he considers is within his consideration. Eisenhower is actually asking Congress to give the US President dictatorial powers to launch war that he has never possessed before, and the scope and nature of the actions are not limited in any way.

While issuing these blatant war cries, Eisenhower again repeated the trick of so-called "UN-mediated ceasefire," hypocritically expressing "welcome" to the United Nations to take actions to "end hostilities in this (Taiwan) region." In fact, Eisenhower's so-called propaganda of "peace" and "ceasefire" is entirely a trick to deceive world opinion. The purpose is to use the two-pronged approach of clamoring for armed intervention and "UN mediation" to make those with weak will tolerate the US interference in China's internal affairs, splitting China, occupying Taiwan, and using Taiwan as a military base to prepare for a new war of aggression against the Chinese people.

Eisenhower's message is a war message. A US government official confirmed this on the same day when he provided so-called "background material" to the press to explain the message. This US official actually admitted that the power Eisenhower requested would allow him to take war actions against any target in any location. He said Eisenhower did not personally go to Congress to read this declaration-of-war-style message because he wanted to avoid giving the impression of a war message. This is precisely a case of "a guilty person giving himself away." Eisenhower's message will not, as he said, "calm" the serious situation in the Taiwan region at all, but greatly increases the tense situation and the crisis of a new war in this region, seriously threatening peace in Asia and the world.

### 美国准备对我国内政进行公开武装干涉  艾森豪威尔向美国国会提出战争咨文

    美国准备对我国内政进行公开武装干涉
    艾森豪威尔向美国国会提出战争咨文
    【新华社二十七日讯】华盛顿消息：就在美国大事散布所谓“由联合国斡旋台湾停火”的空气的时候，美国总统艾森豪威尔一月二十四日向国会提出所谓关于“正在台湾海峡发展的局势”的咨文，要求国会授权他使用美国武装部队来公开干涉中国人民解放台湾、澎湖和中国沿海岛屿并对中国大陆发动直接的武装侵略。这是美国侵略集团明目张胆地干涉中国内政、露骨进行侵略威胁和准备新战争的严重步骤，也就是在所谓“停火”的烟幕后面的威胁亚洲和世界和平的重大战争阴谋。
    艾森豪威尔在他的咨文里对中国人民解放本国领土的正义事业进行了最无耻的恶毒攻击，硬说中国人民行使其主权、解放被蒋介石卖国贼盘踞的台湾、澎湖是有什么“侵略目的”，“威胁”远隔太平洋、距台湾一万公里以上的美国的“安全”。艾森豪威尔还竭力颠倒黑白，说什么台湾的解放“会使现存的道德、“经济和军事力量的平衡大大紊乱”，“会在西太平洋的岛屿锁链中造成一个裂口”，破坏“安全结构”；而把美国侵占中国领土台湾、准备对中国人民进行公开武装干涉说成是“保障美国安全”、“为了和平的利益”。
    尽管艾森豪威尔在咨文中用了不少“和平”、“防御”的伪善辞句，但是他要求国会授权采取的行动完全暴露了美国政府正在进行和进一步布置的是彻头彻尾的侵略战争步骤。他首先宣布他的前任总统杜鲁门在一九五○年发动侵略朝鲜战争后派遣美国第七舰队侵占台湾的命令继续有效，并说，“所有这些军事活动和有关活动将继续下去。”接着他就借口局势“十分危急”要求国会“立刻用具体的决议案参加”美国政府正在积极安排的对中国人民进行武装干涉的措施。他叫嚣美国政府准备采取为了达到干涉中国人民解放台湾的目的“所必需的任何军事行动”。他说美国准备采取的行动是“多种多样的”，在他举出来的行动中包括：对于中国人民军事部队的“任何集中或使用”采取军事行动，对于台湾、澎湖的“进攻的一部分或其肯定预备步骤”行使国会授予的战争权力，以及帮助“重新部署和巩固”台湾蒋贼部队。他还表示，对于所有他认为“密切有关的地点和行动”行使他的战争权力，都在他的考虑之内。艾森豪威尔在这里实际上是要求国会给予美国总统所从未拥有过的发动战争的独裁大权，而且行动的范围和性质没有任何限制。
    艾森豪威尔在发出这些露骨的战争叫嚣同时，又重复玩弄所谓“联合国斡旋停火”的把戏，伪善地表示“欢迎”联合国采取行动“终止这个（台湾）地区的敌对行动”。事实上，艾森豪威尔的所谓
  “和平”、“停火”的张扬，完全是蒙混世界舆论的一种骗术，目的是想通过叫嚣武装干涉和“联合国斡旋”的双管齐下的办法，来使意志薄弱的人忍受美国干涉中国内政、割裂中国、侵占台湾、利用台湾作为军事基地准备新的针对中国人民的侵略战争。
    艾森豪威尔的这个咨文是一个战争咨文。一个美国政府官员在同一天特地为解释这个咨文而向报界提供所谓“背景材料”时证实了这一点。这个美国官员实际上承认，艾森豪威尔所要求的权力将使他可以在任何地点、向任何对象采取战争行动。他说艾森豪威尔因为想避免给人以战争咨文的印象所以没有亲自到国会去宣读这一篇宣战式的咨文。这恰恰是“此地无银三百两”。艾森豪威尔的这个咨文丝毫不是如他所说将会“平息”台湾地区的严重局势，而是大大地增加了这一地区的紧张局势和新战争危机，严重地威胁着亚洲和世界的和平。
