    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 9th: According to Hong Kong newspaper reports, the Trade Subcommittee of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East continued its meeting on the 8th.

    During the discussion on activities to promote trade at the morning session on the 8th, the Soviet representative spoke and put forward three points:

    1.  The Soviet government has made specific proposals to promote the development of trade relations between countries and has also specifically proposed to supply equipment to other countries and provide technical assistance to other countries at the same time. These suggestions have attracted the attention of Asian countries.

    2.  The Soviet representative believes that international expositions can help promote business relations. At the same time, the exchange of business representatives between countries can also help promote trade. The Soviet representative pointed out that the Soviet Union participated in international expositions held in Asia in 1954 and is also preparing to participate in expositions to be held in New Delhi, Karachi, Yangon, and other places in 1955. Regarding the exchange of business representatives, the Soviet representative said that India and Indonesia had sent representatives to the Soviet Union for visits, and such visits would definitely develop international goodwill and economic cooperation. The Soviet government is also prepared to invite countries in Asia and the Far East to participate in geological and mineral surveys in 1955 to allow everyone to study these issues.

    3.  The Soviet representative hopes to establish an international chamber of commerce and use this chamber of commerce to help establish understanding and contact between countries in trade.

    The Soviet representative said that these three points would definitely help promote trade relations between Asia and the Far East and other regions.

    The British representative, in his speech, expressed his support for the Soviet representative's views. He believes that contacts between countries should be expanded. He also believes that international expositions are of great value, and the establishment of an international chamber of commerce is very useful for promoting trade.

    苏联代表提出促进贸易关系的三点意见
    【新华社广州九日电】据香港报纸消息：联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会贸易小组委员会八日继续举行会议。
    在八日上午会议讨论关于促进贸易的活动问题时，苏联代表发言提出了三点意见：
    一、苏联政府曾经提出过具体的建议来促进各国贸易关系的发展，也曾经具体建议把设备供给别的国家，同时用技术援助别的国家。这些建议已经引起亚洲国家的注意。
    二、苏联代表认为：国际性的博览会可以帮助促进商务关系，同时，各国之间交换商务代表，也可以帮助促进贸易。苏联代表指出，苏联曾经在一九五四年参加过在亚洲举行的国际性博览会，并且还准备参加一九五五年在新德里、喀喇蚩、仰光等地举行的博览会。关于交换商务代表的问题，苏联代表说，印度和印度尼西亚曾经派代表到苏联参观和访问，这种访问一定可以发展国际间的善意和经济合作。苏联政府还准备在一九五五年邀请亚洲及远东的国家参加地质和矿物的调查，让大家来研究这些问题。
    三、苏联代表希望能够建立国际性的商会，并且利用这种商会来帮助建立各国之间在贸易方面的了解和接触。
    苏联代表说，这三点意见一定可以帮助促进亚洲及远东地区以及其他地区之间的贸易关系。
    英国代表在发言时表示支持苏联代表的意见。他认为各国之间的接触是应该加以扩大的。他并且认为：国际性博览会有很大的价值，建立国际性商会对促进贸易是很有用处的。
