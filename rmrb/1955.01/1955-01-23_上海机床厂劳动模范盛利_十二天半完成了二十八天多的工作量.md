    Sheng Li, Labor Model of Shanghai Machine Tool Plant
    Completed More Than 28 Days' Work in Twelve and a Half Days
    Since the beginning of production this year, Sheng Li, a labor model at the state-owned Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, had completed the workload of more than 28 actual working days in twelve and a half actual working days by January 16th. In January, Sheng Li had to process 22 types of parts, including ten new products, and the quota for the other twelve types of parts was increased by an average of 30 percent compared to December. After work resumed this year, he actively used his brain, looked for shortcuts, and continuously shortened working hours. For example, when processing the new product "sector gear," it was very time-consuming to measure dimensions with the original "measuring tool." After he added a specially made tool, each operation saved fifteen minutes of measuring time, increasing efficiency by 50 percent. When processing another batch of "gears," the original requirement was to complete it within 30 hours, but Sheng Li completed it in just over eleven hours, increasing efficiency by nearly two times.

    上海机床厂劳动模范盛利
    十二天半完成了二十八天多的工作量
    国营上海机床厂劳动模范盛利今年开始生产以来，到一月十六日止，在十二天半的实际工作日里，完成了二十八天多的实际工作日的工作量。盛利在一月份要加工二十二种零件，其中有十种是新产品，另外十二种零件的定额比十二月份平均提高百分之三十。今年开工以后，他积极动脑筋、找窍门，不断缩短了工时。像在加工新产品“扇形齿轮”时，用原来的“量具”量尺寸是很费时间的，经他加上一个特制的工具后，使每只活节约了十五分钟量尺寸的时间，提高效率百分之五十。在加工另一批“齿轮”时，原来规定是在三十小时以内完成，但盛利用十一个多小时就完成了，提高效率将近两倍。（本报上海记者站）
