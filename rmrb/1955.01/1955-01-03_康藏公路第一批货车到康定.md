After the full opening of the Kangzang Highway, the first batch of over a hundred trucks setting out westward from Ya'an, fully loaded with goods needed by the Tibetan people such as tea, farm tools, and industrial products, arrived in Kangding, the capital of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province, on December 27th of last year. Over four thousand residents, students, and cadres of various ethnic groups including Tibetan, Han, Hui, and Yi in Kangding lined up at the station to welcome them. The Secretary-General of the Autonomous Region People's Government, Living Buddha Rikou, personally presented a Hada (a ceremonial scarf) to the float bearing a portrait of Chairman Mao. Then, the long convoy slowly passed through the urban area of Kangding amidst the cheers of people of all ethnic groups lining the streets. On the 25th, grand celebration meetings were held in important towns along the highway within the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province, such as Kangding and Dege.

    康藏公路第一批货车到康定
    康藏公路全线通车后，自雅安向西开出的第一批汽车百余辆，满载着藏族人民所需的茶叶、农具、工业品等货物，于去年十二月二十七日到达西康省藏族自治区首府康定。康定藏、汉、回、彝等各族居民、学生、干部四千余人均往车站列队欢迎。自治区人民政府秘书长日库活佛并亲自向挂有毛主席像的彩车挂上哈达，接着，漫长的车队在各族人民夹道欢呼中徐徐驶过康定城区。二十五日，西康省藏族自治区内康定、德格等沿公路的重要城镇都举行了盛大的庆祝会。　（本报西康记者站）
