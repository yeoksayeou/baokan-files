State-owned woolen mills in various locations are expanding the scope of wool raw material usage. While ensuring quality, they successfully trial-produced many new blended varieties last year, which will be officially produced this year. Among the new products are coarse and fine yarns, serge, gabardine, various tweeds, haircloth, flannel, and plush made from tussah silk and wool blends; coarse and fine yarns, various tweeds, and women's fabrics made from rayon and wool blends; uniform fabrics made from ramie and wool blends, and gabardine made from red wild hemp and wool blends. Some of these new products are already being test-marketed and are welcomed by sales departments.
