Introducing the "Scientific Knowledge of Socialist Industrialization" Series

Published by the All-China Science and Technology Popularization Association Distributed by Xinhua Bookstore

The All-China Science and Technology Popularization Association compiled and published a series of "Scientific Knowledge of Socialist Industrialization" last year, which is a timely undertaking for the country's socialist economic construction. It is of great help to comrades engaged in theoretical research, general technical workers, rural cadres, and other comrades with a junior high school education or above.

In 1920, Lenin, when discussing the issue of electrification, issued the following call to the Soviet people: "All people with sufficient scientific or practical training should be mobilized without exception to promote the electrification plan and to teach the knowledge necessary to understand it." ("Draft Resolution of the Eighth Congress of Soviets on the Report on Electrification") At present, our country is in an unprecedented period of economic construction, and more and more people in urban and rural areas want to know the situation of national economic construction. Therefore, general, especially industrial, scientific knowledge has become something urgently needed in people's lives. We should, through various means, constantly publicize our country's economic construction and the necessary scientific knowledge to the broad masses of urban and rural people.

This series has many advantages. First, the series uses concrete examples to emphasize the spirit and essence of the Party's general line during the transition period. The series uses eight booklets to explain the uses and interrelationships of the iron and steel industry, the non-ferrous metal industry, the machine-building industry, the fuel industry, and the basic chemical industry.

For example, iron and steel are the foundation of industry and an important link in the country's industrialization and modernization of national defense. In this regard, the series gives us specific explanations. For example, "A car or a tractor requires more than thirty different types of steel and hundreds of steel materials of different shapes and sizes; ...Building a railway like the one from Beijing to Hankou requires 100,000 tons of steel rails alone (equivalent to 200 million jin), and manufacturing a locomotive requires about 100 tons of steel and iron." As for consolidating national defense, iron and steel play an even greater role, and no country can achieve high-level development without the iron and steel industry.

However, "without the cooperation of non-ferrous metals such as tungsten, molybdenum, vanadium, titanium, nickel, and cobalt in the iron and steel industry, it is impossible to obtain high-quality steel and iron alloys, and the iron and steel industry cannot meet the needs of various industries..." In the booklet "Non-ferrous Metal Industry," the author explains the important role of the non-ferrous metal industry in socialist industrialization in a relatively specific way.

Regarding the machine-building industry, the series presents it as the "heart of industry," and provides a relatively specific explanation of the core role of the machine-building industry in socialist industrialization. For example, "To build a steel plant with an annual output of more than one million tons, it requires thousands of tons of mining equipment, thousands of tons of ironmaking equipment, thousands of tons of steelmaking equipment, and tens of thousands of tons of rolling equipment... To extract a large amount of petroleum, many oil drilling rigs, oil derricks, mud pumps, casings, and joints are needed. The oil extraction equipment needed to extract one million tons of oil requires tens of thousands of tons." As for the significant role of the machine-building industry in agriculture, transportation, and national defense, the series provides brief explanations.

To achieve socialist industrialization, it is also necessary to develop the transportation and light industries accordingly. The series uses four booklets to explain the relationship between the transportation industry, the light industry (especially the textile industry), and national industrialization. For example, it says that railways are the pioneer enterprises of socialist industrialization, "Without railways, industrial construction will be greatly affected." The Yumen oil mine in northwestern China is an example where construction and production have been affected to a certain extent due to its distance from the railway. The oil produced here, "if transported to Lanzhou by car, the car itself would consume 30% of the oil it carries, and if transported to Chongqing, it would consume 70%." As for the significance of railways in consolidating national defense and the worker-peasant alliance, the booklets provide specific explanations. In addition, the gradual socialist transformation of agriculture is an important component of the Party's general line during the transition period, and the booklet "Agricultural Production and National Industrialization" also provides necessary explanations on this.

Second, the series provides us with brief scientific knowledge of industrial production in various sectors. For example, steel and iron are the most familiar industrial materials to us, but many people do not understand them. The series summarizes the types of steel and iron, the methods and procedures of smelting, and the conditions for selection. For example, it says: The boundary between pig iron and steel is distinguished by the amount of carbon content, with steel containing less than 2% carbon and pig iron containing more than 2%, etc.

How much is one kilowatt-hour of electricity? This is also something we often hear but do not know. The series also tells us: "The unit for calculating the size of electricity is kilowatt, and the amount of electricity generated by each kilowatt of power equipment in one hour is one kilowatt-hour... One kilowatt of capacity is usually equivalent to the labor of ten people, because each person can only work one shift a day, and three shifts are required day and night, so a one-kilowatt generator operates non-stop for twenty-four hours a day, which is equivalent to the work of thirty people..."

The development of science allows us to use the "energy" resources of nature to generate electricity. We can not only use the heat of thermal power, wind power, hydropower, and sunlight, but also the large amount of energy contained in atomic energy to generate electricity. Regarding the use of atomic energy to generate electricity, this has become a reality in the Soviet Union today. The series uses thermal power generation as an example to explain the principle and process of power generation, and uses charts to visually show us how to use various natural power resources to form an ideal power grid. Undoubtedly, it will encourage our enthusiasm for building socialism to a certain extent.

Third, the series also uses considerable space to introduce the past, present, and future of industrial production in various sectors of our country. These materials can be used as a reference for us to conduct patriotic education among the masses.

Before liberation, our country had almost no heavy industry, and a large number of mineral resources were hidden underground, unattended. Imperialists often fabricated slanders such as "China has no iron ore" and "China is a country poor in oil" to use as pretexts for invading China. The series uses facts to expose these despicable conspiracies: In the Junggar Basin and Tarim Basin in Xinjiang, the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai, the Jiuquan Basin in Gansu, as well as the northern Shaanxi Basin, the Sichuan Basin, the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the North China Plain..., there is the possibility of extracting natural petroleum, and many places in our country also have raw materials for artificial petroleum. Our country also has extremely rich fuel and water resources. "The known reserves of coal have now reached more than 440 billion tons. If one-tenth is used for power generation, it can supply 30 million kilowatts of thermal power equipment for more than 300 years. Our country's hydropower resources are about 150 million kilowatts. If continuously developed, it is inexhaustible and inexhaustible." Of course, with the development of our country's economic construction, more arduous tasks have been put before geologists. We must continue to work hard to explore more of our motherland's underground treasures!

Fourth, in general, the language of the series is relatively popular. To make it easier for readers to understand, the series also includes charts and photos. This will be of considerable help to readers, especially those with lower levels of education and less scientific knowledge, in understanding its content.

The series meets readers in the form of eighteen booklets. Reading each booklet separately allows readers to gain a relatively complete understanding of the industrial production of the sector it covers. Reading them together helps to understand the entire socialist industrialization and socialist transformation of our country.

However, this series also has some shortcomings. For example, we know that the publisher of the series intends to present it as a unified and complete set of booklets to readers, but there is no booklet at the beginning of the series to introduce the whole picture of socialist industrialization in our country, such as its importance, its guidelines and tasks, and its favorable conditions and difficulties, etc. This should be added.

The correctness of viewpoints and wording should be given special attention. However, the series also has some shortcomings in this regard. For example, in the booklet "Non-ferrous Metal Industry," there is a title that says: "Non-ferrous metals are the material basis of socialist industrialization." The basis of industrialization is heavy industry, and non-ferrous metals are only a part of it. It is obviously incorrect to say that the part is the whole.

Pictures are one of the most motivating forms of publicity, and editors should not be careless in this regard. Unfortunately, some of the pictures in the series greatly weaken its motivational significance because they are blurred.

In addition, more popular, more logical language, and more vivid and interesting narratives are also one of the most important requirements of scientific popularization books. The editors and authors of the series should make greater efforts in this regard.

    介绍“社会主义工业化科学知识”丛书
    徐伟立
    中华全国科学技术普及协会出版  新华书店发行
    中华全国科学技术普及协会去年编纂出版了一套“社会主义工业化科学知识”丛书，这对于国家的社会主义经济建设，是一件适合时宜的工作。它无论对于从事理论研究工作的同志、一般的技术工人、农村干部，以及其他具有初中以上文化程度的同志，都有很大的帮助。
    一九二○年，列宁在谈到电气化的问题时，曾向苏联人民发出这样的号召：“全体具有足够的科学训练或实际训练的人都应当毫无例外地动员起来，去宣传电气化计划和讲授为了解电气化计划所必需的知识。”（“第八次苏维埃代表大会关于电气化报告的决议草案”）目前，我国正处在经济建设的空前高涨时期，越来越多的城乡群众要求知道国家经济建设的情况，因而一般的，特别是关于工业方面的科学知识，已成为群众生活中所迫切需要的东西。我们应当通过各种各样的方式，经常向广大城乡群众宣传我们国家的经济建设，及其必需掌握的科学知识。
    这套丛书具有不少的优点。首先，丛书用具体的事例，着重说明了党在过渡时期总路线的精神和实质，丛书用了八本小册子，分别说明了钢铁工业、有色金属工业、机器制造工业、燃料工业和基本化学工业的用途及其互相关系。
    比如，钢铁是工业基础的基础，是国家工业化和国防现代化的重要环节。在这方面，丛书里给了我们具体的说明。如“一部汽车或者一架拖拉机，需要三十种以上不同的钢种，和数百种形状不同尺寸不同的钢材；……修筑一条像从北京到汉口的铁路，仅钢轨一项就需要十万吨（相当于二亿市斤），制造一辆机车大约需要钢和铁一百余吨。”至于巩固国防，钢铁更起着重大的作用，任何一个国家要能高度的发展都是离不了钢铁工业的。
    但是，“钢铁工业中如没有钨、钼、钒、钛、镍和钴等有色金属的配合，就不可能得到优质的钢和铁合金，钢铁工业也就不能适应各种工业的需要……”。在“有色金属工业”这本小册子中，作者比较具体地说明了有色金属工业在社会主义工业化中的重大作用。
    关于机器制造工业，丛书里是把它作为“工业的心脏”提出来的，它对机器制造业在社会主义工业化中的核心作用，做了比较具体的说明。比如，“要建设一个年产百万吨以上的钢铁厂，就需要几千吨采矿设备，几千吨炼铁设备，几千吨炼钢设备，和几万吨压延设备。……要想把石油大量开采出来，就需要许多石油钻机、油井架、泥浆泵、套管和接头等。开采一百万吨石油所需要的采油设备就需要十几万吨。”至于机器制造业在农业、交通运输业和国防等方面的重大作用，丛书都做了简要说明。
    要实现社会主义工业化，还必须相应地发展交通运输业和轻工业。丛书用了四本小册子来说明交通运输业、轻工业（特别是纺织工业）和国家工业化的关系。如说，铁路是社会主义工业化的先行企业，“如果没有铁路，就会使工业建设受到很大的影响。”我国西北玉门的石油矿，就是因为距铁路远而使建设和生产受到一定影响的一个例子。这里生产的石油，“如果用汽车运到兰州，汽车本身就得消耗所载油量百分之三十，如果运到重庆，就得消耗百分之七十。”至于铁路在巩固国防、巩固工农联盟等方面的意义，小册子里都做了具体的说明。此外，对农业逐步地进行社会主义改造，是党在过渡时期总路线的重要组成部分，“农业生产与国家工业化”一本小册子也对此做了必要的说明。
    第二，丛书简要地给我们提供了各部门工业生产的科学知识。比如，钢和铁是我们最熟悉的工业材料，但很多人对于它们并不了解。而丛书则概括地说明了钢铁的种类、冶炼的方法和程序，以及选择的条件等。如说：生铁和钢的界限是以其含炭量的多少来区分，含炭在百分之二以下的叫钢，在百分之二以上的叫生铁，等等。
    一度电究竟是多少呢？这也是我们常常听见而不知道的，丛书也告诉我们：“计算电力大小的单位是瓩，每瓩的电力设备在一小时所发出的电能量就是一度电。……一瓩的能力通常相当于十个人的劳动力，因为每人一天只能做一班工作，昼夜就要三班人轮换，所以一瓩的发电机一天二十四小时运转不休，就等于三十个人做工……”。
    科学的发展，使我们可以利用自然界的“能”的资源来发电，我们不仅可以利用火力、风力、水力、日光的热力，而且可以利用原子能所含有的大量能力来发电。关于利用原子能来发电，在苏联今天已成为事实。丛书里以火力发电为例子，来说明了发电的原理和过程，并用图表的形式，比较形象地告诉我们如何利用各种天然动力资源所组成的理想的发电动力网。无疑地，它将在一定程度上鼓舞着我们建设社会主义的热情。
    第三，丛书还用了相当大的篇幅介绍了我国各个部门工业生产的过去、现在和将来的情景，这些材料可供我们向群众进行爱国主义教育宣传时的参考。
    解放前，我国几乎没有重工业，大批的矿产蕴藏在地下，无人过问。帝国主义者还常常制造“中国无铁矿”和“中国是一个石油贫乏的国家”等等谰言，来作为侵略中国的借口。丛书里用事实揭穿了这些卑劣的阴谋：在新疆的准噶尔盆地、塔里木盆地、青海的柴达木盆地、甘肃的酒泉盆地，以及陕北盆地、四川盆地、长江下游、华北平原……，都有开采天然石油的可能，而且我国不少地方还有着人造石油的原料。我国也有着极丰富的燃料和水力资源。“煤的储藏量现在知道的就已达四千四百多亿吨，如果用十分之一来发电，也可供三千万瓩火力设备用三百多年之久。我国水力资源约有一亿五千万瓩，如果不断开发，是取之不尽用之不竭的。”当然，随着我们国家经济建设的发展，在地质工作者面前就提出了更艰巨的任务。我们必须继续努力，把祖国更多的地下宝藏勘探出来！
    第四，一般说来，丛书的文字是比较通俗的。为了使读者更易了解，丛书内还附有图表和照片。这对于读者，特别是文化水平较低、科学知识较少的读者理解其内容，是会有相当大的帮助的。
    丛书是以十八本小册子和读者见面的，分别阅读，每一本小册子都可使读者对于所涉及的那一部门的工业生产得到一个比较完整的了解；合起来阅读，则有助于对我国社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的整个了解。
    但是，这套丛书还有些缺点。例如：我们知道，丛书的出版者是企图把它当做一套统一的、完整的小册子和读者见面的，但是，在丛书的前面就没有一本小册子来介绍我国社会主义工业化的全貌，如它的重要性，它的方针和任务，以及它的有利条件和困难等，这是应该增添的。
    观点和用语的正确，是应加特别注意的。但是，丛书在这方面也有一些缺点。如“有色金属工业”这本小册子中有一个标题说：“有色金属是社会主义工业化的物质基础”。而工业化的基础是重工业，有色金属只是其中的一部分。将部分说成全体，这显然是不对的。
    图片是最富有鼓动性的宣传形式之一，编者在这方面不应有丝毫的马虎。可惜，丛书里有些图片因为模糊不清，就大大地削弱了它的鼓动意义。
    此外，更通俗、更合乎逻辑的文字，更生动、更有趣味的叙述也是科学普及书籍的最重要要求之一，丛书的编者和作者应当在这方面作更大的努力。
