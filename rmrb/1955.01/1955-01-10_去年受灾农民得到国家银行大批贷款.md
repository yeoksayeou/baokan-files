Last year, farmers in disaster-stricken areas across the country received large production and disaster relief loans from the National Bank. According to incomplete statistics from the Head Office of the People's Bank of China, over 600 billion yuan in loans have been issued to farmers in disaster areas.

These loans have powerfully supported farmers in disaster areas in their efforts to restore production through their own efforts. The Tianjin Special District, through loans, expanded wheat fields by more than 390,000 mu. In Anhui Province, members of Zhang Dening's mutual aid team in Dayugou Township, Huoshan County, lacked confidence after the disaster. After receiving loans to purchase necessary farm tools and solve some of the members' living difficulties, their morale soared, and they reclaimed 103 mu of wasteland. After receiving loans, the Bu Ping'an mutual aid team in Xinxiang County, Henan Province, organized transportation, milling, cotton ginning, and women's weaving, earning more than 3 million yuan in just 26 days. This not only solved the living difficulties of the team members, but also further consolidated the mutual aid team, which is now preparing to transform into an agricultural production cooperative. Farmers in Gaochao and other townships in Xishui County, Hubei Province, said after receiving loans: The flood of 1931 was a great disaster, but the flood of 1954 was a great flood, but a smaller disaster; with the state's assistance, we will not only not flee famine, but also rebuild our homes and restore production.

    去年受灾农民得到国家银行大批贷款
    全国去年受灾地区的农民得到国家银行发放的大批生产救灾贷款，据中国人民银行总行目前不完全统计，已发放到灾区农民手中的贷款共六千多亿元。
    这些贷款有力地支持灾区农民进行生产自救。天津专区通过贷款，扩大麦田三十九万多亩。安徽省霍山县大于沟乡张德宁互助组组员受灾后信心不高，经贷款添置必要的农具，及解决部分组员的生活困难后，情绪高涨，开垦荒地一百零三亩。河南省新乡县布平安互助组得到贷款后，组织运输、磨粉、轧花、妇女纺织等，仅二十六天即获利三百余万元，不仅解决了组员们的生活困难，互助组也更加巩固，该组正酝酿转为农业生产合作社。湖北省浠水县高潮等乡农民得到贷款后反映说：一九三一年的水大灾大，一九五四年的水大灾小；国家扶助我们，我们不但不逃荒，还能重建家园，恢复生产。
