Xinhua News Agency, January 27th: TASS Moscow, January 26th: V. Borovsky published an article in "Pravda" commenting on the United States' shameless interference in China's internal affairs.

He wrote that on January 24th, President Eisenhower submitted a special message to Congress requesting authorization to use US armed forces to guarantee the so-called "security of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands," which, in other words, is openly armed interference in China's internal affairs.

Both houses of Congress are rushing to consider this message. Borovsky pointed out that the issue now is preparing for direct aggression against the mainland territory of China by US armed forces.

This political action is yet another step in a series of aggressive steps taken by the American ruling clique against the People's Republic of China. Peace-loving people of all countries consider this action to be a shameless act of American interference in China's internal affairs and a threat to the cause of peace and security.

Eisenhower's practice of demanding freedom of action in the Taiwan Strait region fully exposes the true meaning and purpose of some messages emanating from the United States, which say that the American diplomatic authorities are trying to achieve a "ceasefire" in the Taiwan Strait. Washington wants a "ceasefire" that can prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan and other islands belonging to the Chinese people but occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek clique. At the same time, Washington itself, under the pretext of helping the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, is preparing to directly intervene in the war and expand its aggression against China.

Borovsky continued, it is noteworthy that three US aircraft carriers were sent to the Taiwan area and US Seventh Fleet ships were sent to the coastal areas of Zhejiang Province before President Eisenhower delivered his message. At the same time, the commander of the US Seventh Fleet and the heads of the Chiang Kai-shek clique held a special meeting in Taiwan. According to US newspaper reports, this meeting was closely linked to the US plan to interfere in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China. The US Command, under the pretext of assisting Chiang Kai-shek in the evacuation from Dachen Island, announced its intention to send a large number of armed forces there.

All these messages illustrate what the recent US plans are all about, and the US President's request to Congress for broad powers is precisely to implement these plans. It is clear that Washington intends to prevent Chiang Kai-shek from collapsing through open armed intervention and is preparing to invade the Chinese mainland.

Borovsky continued, the American rulers, who are obsessed with aggression, are unwilling to consider any principles of international law. "I want this thing, so I take action" - this is the only maxim they abide by. It is on this basis that they occupy Chinese coastal islands and carry out provocative activities with the help of their Chiang Kai-shek mercenaries.

The Chinese people have responded to all this with calm and firm answers: they are determined to liberate Taiwan, which is their territory, and no threats or provocations can prevent the victory of their just cause.

Borovsky pointed out that the ruling groups of the United States' allies rushed to adopt a more cautious attitude, emphasizing that Eisenhower's proposal was "American."

Borovsky concluded that the great Chinese people are exercising their legitimate right to liberate Taiwan, which legally belongs to them, and to defend their independence and sovereignty, which is also to safeguard the cause of peace and security for the people of the Far East and the world. For this reason, they receive the sympathy and support of all peace-loving countries.

Czechoslovak Radio published a commentary
Exposing the "Ceasefire" Conspiracy of the American Ruling Clique

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 27th: Czechoslovak Radio broadcast a commentary on January 25th on the recent US request for the UN to "mediate a ceasefire in Taiwan."

The radio said: Eisenhower and Dulles want to save the Chiang Kai-shek clique at the last moment and continue to build their war base in Taiwan in order to carry out aggressive war against the People's Republic of China.

The radio said: If Eisenhower and Dulles are concerned about creating conditions for peace in the Far East, they have a responsibility to withdraw their armed forces from Taiwan and stop supporting the Chiang Kai-shek clique's war preparations. But only yesterday, Eisenhower asked the US Congress to authorize him to use US armed forces, if necessary, to deal with the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan.

The radio pointed out: The Chinese people have repeatedly stated their firm determination to liberate Taiwan. They have proved this determination with practical actions in the past few days. The Chinese People's Liberation Army liberated Yijiangshan Island and annihilated the Chiang Kai-shek army on the island.

Bulgarian "Fatherland Front" published an article
Denouncing the United States' attempt to use the United Nations again for aggression

Xinhua News Agency, January 27th: Sofia News: On the 25th, major newspapers in Sofia published the full text of Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement on the US government's interference in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan. On the 26th, the "Fatherland Front" also published an article by the newspaper's commentator. The article said: Now it is clear that the United States, as in Korea, wants to use the United Nations to achieve its goals of aggression and occupation of other countries' territories. However, people know that the UN Charter does not give the UN any right to interfere in internal affairs that belong entirely to each country. Therefore, neither the United Nations nor any other country has the right to interfere in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan.

London "Daily Worker" published an editorial
Attacking the Barbarous Attitude of American Imperialism

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 27th: London "Daily Worker" published an editorial on the 26th entitled "Unreasonableness Knows No Bounds," commenting on Eisenhower's special message. The editorial said: The imperialist barbarity expressed in Eisenhower's message has reached its extreme.

The editorial said: Eisenhower declared that in order to "ensure the security of the United States," he has the right to occupy the Chinese island of Taiwan, which is five thousand miles away from the west coast of the United States. The editorial said that Eisenhower declared that in order to defend the United States from an attack by China, he is prepared to launch a war.

Then the editorial asked: Does the United States really think that everyone else in the world is an idiot?

Who believes that the Chinese would cross the Pacific Ocean to attack the United States?

The United States says it has the right to occupy the territory of other countries, on the pretext that doing so is necessary for the security of the United States.

The editorial emphasized: The British people unanimously oppose participating in a war to protect the American stooge Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan.

The British people want peace, and they cannot agree with the theory that the United States has the right to occupy the territory of others anytime, anywhere, on the grounds that owning these territories is necessary for the defense of the United States.

The editorial said: British democratic groups must demand that the British government not deal with the American madmen who are trying to lead the world into war.

"Indonesia News" published an editorial
Denouncing the US War Cries of Interference in Our Internal Affairs

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 27th: "Indonesia News" published an editorial on the 26th, condemning the United States' attempt to armed interfere in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan and Penghu.

The editorial said that the US House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee's authorization to Eisenhower to use armed forces to "defend" Taiwan and Penghu is seen as war cries in Asian and African countries. This is also pressure on the countries participating in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization meeting. The United States is trying to intimidate Asian countries with its so-called threat from the People's Republic of China, so that they will participate in the US joint security treaty.

The editorial pointed out that the purpose of this move by the United States is to undermine the unity and peace between Asian and African countries, because it believes that this unity and peace is detrimental to the interests of the United States and its colonial policies. The United States wants to damage the reputation of the People's Republic of China and undermine its prestige among Asian and African countries.

The editorial said that it is precisely because the United States is shouting about war that Asian and African countries have become more united than ever before. The editorial also said that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization meeting is to force the participating countries to prepare for war, while the Asian-African Conference is to unite Asian and African countries to help stop the war. Unity, friendship and peace are the basic aspirations of mankind. Any effort to move towards war is contrary to the wishes of Asian and African countries and all mankind.

The editorial concluded: "Based on our firm belief in friendship and peace, we believe that the US conspiracy to undermine and harm the unity and peace of Asian and African countries will once again fail."

"Reform Newspaper" said that Taiwan and other islands should be handed over to the legitimate Chinese government supported by the entire Chinese people.

    各国舆论谴责美国干涉我国内政
    苏联“真理报”发表文章
    斥美国威胁世界和平和安全事业
     【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十六日讯：维·波罗夫斯基在“真理报”发表文章，评论美国无耻干涉中国内政的行为。
    他写道，一月二十四日，艾森豪威尔总统向国会提出一项特别咨文，要求授权使用美国的武装部队来保证所谓“台湾和澎湖的安全”，换句话说，就是公开武装干涉中国的内政。
    国会两院正在赶忙考虑这个咨文。波罗夫斯基指出，现在的问题是准备由美国武装部队直接侵略中国大陆领土。
    这个政治行动是美国统治集团对中华人民共和国采取的一系列侵略步骤中的又一个步骤。爱好和平的各国人民认为这个行动是美国无耻干涉中国内政的行动，是对和平和安全的事业的威胁。
    艾森豪威尔要求在台湾海峡地区有行动自由的做法完全暴露了从美国传出的一些消息的真正意义和目的，这些消息说，美国外交当局正设法在台湾海峡实现“停火”。华盛顿想要一个能阻止中国人民解放台湾和属于中国人民但为蒋介石集团所盘踞的其他岛屿的“停火”。同时，华盛顿本身正在借口帮助蒋介石匪帮，准备直接干预战事，扩大对中国的侵略。
    波罗夫斯基接着说，值得注意的是，在艾森豪威尔总统发表咨文以前曾有三艘美国航空母舰被派到台湾地区，美国第七舰队舰只被派到浙江省沿海地区。同时美国第七舰队司令和蒋介石集团的头目们在台湾举行了一次特别会议。根据美国报纸消息判断，这次会议是同美国干涉中华人民共和国内政的计划紧紧联在一起的。美国司令部借口帮助蒋介石进行从大陈岛撤退的工作，宣布打算派大批武装部队到那里去。
    所有这些消息都说明了美国最近的计划是怎样一回事，而美国总统要求国会给以广泛的权力正是为了实现这些计划。由此可见，华盛顿打算通过公开的武装干涉使蒋介石免于垮台，并且准备进犯中国大陆。
    波罗夫斯基接着说，一心想进行侵略的美国统治者们不愿考虑国际法的任何原则。“我要得到这个东西，所以我就采取行动”——这是他们遵守的唯一格言。正是根据这个格言，他们占领中国沿海岛屿，在他们的蒋介石雇佣军的帮助下进行挑衅活动。
    中国人民对这一切给予镇静而坚决的答复：他们决心解放台湾，台湾是他们的领土，任何威胁或挑衅绝不能阻止他们的正义事业获得胜利。
    波罗夫斯基指出，美国的盟国的统治集团赶忙采取一种比较审慎的态度，强调说艾森豪威尔的建议是“美国的”。
    波罗夫斯基最后说，伟大的中国人民行使自己的正当权利去解放依法属于他们所有的台湾，保卫自己的独立和主权，这也就是维护远东和世界各国人民的和平和安全的事业。正因为如此，他们得到一切爱好和平的国家的同情和支持。
    捷克斯洛伐克电台发表评论
    揭穿美国统治集团“停火”的阴谋
    【新华社布拉格二十七日电】捷克斯洛伐克电台在二十五日就美国最近要求通过联合国“斡旋台湾停火”的问题发表评论。
    电台说：艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯想要在最后的时刻挽救蒋介石集团，并继续在台湾建立他们的战争基地，以便对中华人民共和国进行侵略战争。
    电台说：如果艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯对于在远东创设和平的条件是关心的话，他们就有责任从台湾撤回他们的武装部队，并停止支持蒋介石集团的战争准备。但是，仅仅就在昨天，艾森豪威尔还要求美国国会授权他在必要时使用美国武装部队来对付中国人民解放台湾。
    电台指出：中国人民已经多次声明了他们要解放台湾的坚定决心。他们在过去几天中已经用实际行动证明了这个决心，中国人民解放军解放了一江山岛，歼灭了岛上的蒋介石军队。
    保加利亚“祖国阵线报”发表文章
    斥美国想再次利用联合国进行侵略
    【新华社二十七日讯】索非亚消息：二十五日索非亚各大报刊载了周恩来总理兼外长关于美国政府干涉中国人民解放台湾的声明的全文。二十六日
  “祖国阵线报”并且发表了该报评论员的文章。文章说：现在人们看得很清楚，美国同它在朝鲜一样想利用联合国去实现它侵略和占领别国领土的目的。但是，人们知道，联合国宪章并没有给联合国任何权利去干涉完全属于各个国家的内部事情。因此，无论是联合国或是任何其他国家都没有权利干涉中国人民解放台湾的行动。
    伦敦“工人日报”发表社论
    抨击美帝国主义的横蛮态度
    【新华社柏林二十七日电】伦敦“工人日报”二十六日以“蛮横无理得没有边了”为题发表社论，评论艾森豪威尔的特别咨文。社论说：艾森豪威尔的咨文中表现的帝国主义横蛮态度，真是达到极点了。
    社论说：艾森豪威尔宣告，为了“保障美国的安全”，他有权占据离美国西海岸五千英里的中国台湾岛。社论说，艾森豪威尔宣告，为了保卫美国不受到中国的进攻，他准备发动一次战争。
    接着社论问道：难道美国竟认为世界上其他的人都是些白痴么？
    谁相信中国人会渡过太平洋去进攻美国呢？
    美国说它有权占领其他国家的领土，借口是这样做对美国的安全来说是必要的。
    社论强调说：英国人民一致反对参加保护在台湾的美国走狗蒋介石的战争。
    英国人民希望和平，他们不能赞成这样的理论：美国有权随时随地占领别人的领土，理由是拥有这些领土对美国的防御来说是必要的。
    社论说：英国的各民主团体必须要求英国政府不要同那些企图把世界引向战争的美国疯子打交道。
    “印度尼西亚新闻”发表社论
    斥美国干涉我国内政的战争叫嚷
    【新华社雅加达二十七日电】“印度尼西亚新闻”二十六日发表社论，斥责美国企图武装干涉中国人民解放台湾和澎湖。
    社论说，美国众议院外交委员会授权艾森豪威尔使用武装部队“保卫”台湾和澎湖一事，在亚非国家看来，是战争叫嚷。这也是对参加东南亚条约组织会议的国家的压力。美国企图用它所谓的中华人民共和国的威胁来威吓亚洲国家，使它们参加美国的共同安全条约。
    社论指出，美国这个举动的目的在于破坏亚非国家之间的团结与和平，因为它认为，这种团结与和平是对美国的利益和它的殖民主义政策不利的。美国想破坏中华人民共和国的名誉，破坏他在亚非国家间的威信。
    社论说，正是因为美国叫嚷要进行战争，亚非国家变得比以往更加团结了。社论又说，东南亚条约组织会议是要强迫与会国家进行战争准备，而亚非会议是为了团结亚非国家帮助制止战争。团结、友谊与和平是人类的基本愿望。走向战争的任何努力都是违反亚非国家和全人类的愿望的。
    社论最后说：“我们基于友谊与和平的坚强信念，相信美国企图破坏和损害亚非国家的团结与和平的阴谋将再一次遭到失败。”
    阿富汗“革新报”
    谴责美国支持蒋贼发动战争的行动
      【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社喀布尔二十五日讯：“革新报”谴责台湾蒋介石集团企图发动战争的行动，并要求美国不要给他们任何帮助和支持。
  “革新报”说，台湾和其他岛屿应交给全体中国人民所支持的合法的中国政府。
