Xinhua News Agency, January 12th: In the thirty-eight days up to today, more than 140,000 people have visited the "Exhibition of Evidence of U.S. Aerial Espionage" held at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace. In addition to workers, farmers, government cadres, People's Liberation Army soldiers, students, and citizens, the audience also included foreign students and other foreign guests in Beijing.

Song Qingling, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, visited on January 11.

Many viewers expressed their thoughts in the guestbook. After quoting the personal confession of American spy Arnold, "I fully understand that our carrying weapons and radios to invade Chinese airspace this time violates international law and infringes upon the interests of the Chinese people," viewer Luo Huhe wrote in the message: "Isn't this ironclad evidence? What else can be denied? The Chinese people's handling of these spies is completely correct, reasonable, and legal." A Vietnamese student studying at Peking University, Huang Dan, wrote the following reflection: "The U.S. imperialists' slander and 'accusations' against China in the United Nations are completely untenable, and China's judgment on these spies is a matter of course." Worker Zhang Jianzhong wrote: "After seeing the exhibition, I deeply realized the aggressive face of U.S. imperialism. I will work hard to produce and support the struggle to liberate Taiwan and smash the U.S.-Chiang 'Joint Defense Treaty'."

According to Xinhua News Agency, January 11th: Panchen Erdeni Chos-kyi Gyal-tsen, Vice Chairman of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, visited the "Exhibition of Evidence of U.S. Aerial Espionage" at the Working People's Cultural Palace on the afternoon of January 8.

Accompanying him on the visit were: Wang Feng, Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, Zhang Jingwu, Representative of the Central People's Government in Tibet, and Fan Ming, Deputy Political Commissar of the Tibet Military Region. Accompanying Panchen Erdeni were Jiji Jinmei, Director of the Panchen Kampus Ladrang Committee, and others.

    各界人民和外宾看到了美国空投特务罪证
    【新华社十二日讯】到今天为止的三十八天中，参观在北京劳动人民文化宫举行的“美国空投特务罪证展览会”的已有十四万多人。观众除工人、农民、机关干部、人民解放军战士、学生、市民以外，还有在北京的外国留学生和其他外宾。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长宋庆龄曾在一月十一日前往参观。
    很多观众在留言簿上发表感想。观众罗湖河在留言中引用了美国间谍阿诺德的亲笔供词“我充分的了解，我们这次携带武器、电台侵入中国领空，是违犯了国际公法和侵犯了中国人民的利益”后，写道：“这不是铁的证据吗？还有什么可抵赖的呢？中国人民对这些间谍的处理是完全正确的，合理合法的。”一个在北京大学学习的越南留学生黄淡写下了这样的感想：“美帝国主义在联合国对中国的诬蔑、‘控诉’是完全站不住脚的，中国对这些间谍的判决是天经地义的事。”工人张建中写道：“看了展览会深刻地认识到美帝国主义的侵略面目，我要努力生产，支援解放台湾的斗争，粉碎美蒋‘共同防御条约’。”
    据新华社十一日讯：中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会副主席班禅额尔德尼·却吉坚赞，在一月八日下午到劳动人民文化宫参观了“美国空投特务罪证展览会”。

    班禅额尔德尼等参观了陈列着美国间谍唐奈和阿诺德等两个间谍案的全部罪证的展览室及另外两个展览室。
