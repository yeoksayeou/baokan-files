The Fourth National Handicraft Work Conference concluded on January 5th. The meeting reviewed the organizational development and production plan execution of handicraft production cooperatives in 1954, studied the handicraft organizational development and production plan for 1955, as well as measures for implementing and completing the plan; and discussed the responsibilities and staffing of handicraft management organs at all levels and the operations and staffing of handicraft production federations at all levels.

During the meeting, Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China, Zhu De, attended and gave important instructions; Soviet expert Yevseyev gave a special report on "Soviet Socialist Planning and Handicraft Cooperative Planning." The representatives conducted group discussions on some specific issues.

The meeting believes that the handicraft cooperativization movement in 1954 basically implemented the policy of "active leadership, steady progress" and achieved considerable results. It is estimated that by the end of 1954, the number of people organized into handicraft production cooperatives (groups) nationwide will be more than 1.1 million, equivalent to 3.69 times that of 1953, and the total output value will reach 12 trillion yuan, equivalent to 2.26 times that of 1953. So far, there are twelve provincial (municipal) handicraft administration bureaus and fifty-five provincial (municipal) and province-administered city federations (or federation preparatory committees) nationwide. Under the correct leadership of party organizations and governments at all levels, and with the support and assistance of state-owned trade, supply and marketing, consumer cooperatives, state banks, and tax bureaus, as well as the efforts of all cooperative cadres and members, handicraft production has been improved and developed. The superiority of organization has been demonstrated in increasing production, improving quality, and reducing costs. Many regions have organized and cultivated typical examples, summarized experiences, and played a good exemplary role in the socialist transformation of handicrafts. The shortcomings are that there are still many problems in production organization, democratic management, ideological education, and business operations, which need to be overcome in the future. Regarding the supply, production, and sales of handicrafts, the meeting pointed out that all industries must achieve reasonable arrangements and overall consideration, so that they can each be in their proper place. Local party committees and governments must regard handicrafts as an important component of local industry. When formulating plans, the various plans of handicrafts, especially the supply, production, and sales plans, should be compiled and balanced in a unified manner.

Regarding the production tasks for 1955, the meeting made specific provisions: continue to implement the policy of "active leadership, steady progress," actively develop new cooperatives, further consolidate and improve existing cooperatives, and strengthen the unity and education of the vast number of individual handicraftsmen, guiding them to take the road of cooperativization. Better handicraft production cooperatives should establish production management systems, medium-sized cooperatives should earnestly improve democratic management, and weaker cooperatives should be rectified. In 1955, the number of members of handicraft production cooperatives should be developed to about 2 million; the total output value should be more than 20 trillion yuan; the labor productivity of the original cooperative (group) members is required to increase by about 10%, and the experience of developing handicraft production cooperatives and building cooperatives in ethnic minority areas should be studied and carried out.

The meeting believes that in order to complete the above tasks, it is necessary to strengthen investigation and research work, conduct "industry ranking" of handicrafts; strengthen the business operations of handicraft production cooperative federations at all levels and the democratic management of handicraft production cooperatives. Conduct constitution education for members. Continue to strengthen the unity and education work of handicraft workers and independent laborers. In particular, it is necessary to strengthen the party's political leadership, improve leadership organs, and enrich and cultivate cadres, which is an important key to doing a good job.

The meeting finally decided to establish the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Handicraft Production Cooperatives, with Bai Rubing, Zheng Jie, and Zhao Pinsan as nine standing committee members. It was also decided that Bai Rubing and Zheng Jie would be the director and deputy director of the Standing Committee, respectively.

    全国手工业工作会议确定今年生产任务
   【本报讯】全国第四次手工业工作会议已在一月五日闭幕。会议检查了一九五四年手工业生产合作社组织发展和生产计划执行的情况，研究了一九五五年手工业组织发展和生产计划，以及执行和完成计划的措施；讨论了各级手工业管理机关的职责和编制、各级手工业生产联社的业务和编制。
    会议期间，中华人民共和国副主席朱德到会作了重要指示；苏联专家耶夫绥也夫作了“苏联社会主义计划化和工艺合作社计划化”的专题报告。代表们对一些专门问题分组进行了讨论。
    会议认为，一九五四年的手工业合作化运动基本上贯彻了“积极领导、稳步前进”的方针，并获得了相当成绩。预计到一九五四年底全国组织起来的手工业生产合作社（组）的人数有一百一十多万人，相当于一九五三年的三点六九倍，生产总值达十二万亿元，相当于一九五三年的二点二六倍。到目前为止，全国已有十二个省（市）级手工业管理局、五十五个省（市）和省辖市联合社（或联合社筹委会）。在各级党组织、政府的正确领导及国营贸易、供销、消费合作社和国家银行、税务局的扶持和帮助以及全体合作社干部和社员的努力下，手工业生产有了改进和发展。在增加生产、提高质量、降低成本方面，都显示了组织起来的优越性。不少地区组织培养了典型，总结了经验，对手工业的社会主义改造工作起了良好的示范作用。缺点是在组织生产、民主管理、思想教育、业务经营方面还存在不少问题，今后需要克服。关于手工业生产的供产销问题，会议指出：各行各业必须做到合理的安排，统筹兼顾，使它们各得其所。各地党委和政府必须将手工业看作地方工业的一个重要组成部分。在编制计划时，应将手工业的各项计划，尤其是供产销计划统一编列与平衡。
    关于一九五五年的生产任务，会议做了具体的规定：继续贯彻“积极领导、稳步前进”的方针，积极发展新社，进一步巩固提高原有社，并加强对广大个体手工业者的团结教育，引导他们走合作化的道路。比较好的手工业生产合作社应建立生产管理制度，中等社要切实搞好民主管理，对较差的社要进行整顿。一九五五年手工业生产合作社社员要发展到二百万人左右；生产总值为二十多万亿元；要求原有社（组）员的劳动生产率提高百分之十左右，并研究开展少数民族地区的手工业生产社和建社的经验。
    会议认为，要完成上述任务，必须加强调查研究工作，对手工业进行“行业排队”；加强各级手工业生产合作社联合社的业务经营和手工业生产合作社的民主管理。对社员进行社章教育。继续加强对手工业工人和独立劳动者的团结教育工作。特别要加强党的政治领导，健全领导机构，充实和培养干部，这是作好工作的重要关键。
    会议最后决定成立中华全国手工业生产合作社联合总社筹备委员会，由白如冰、郑洁、赵品三等九人担任常务委员。并决定以白如冰、郑洁为常务委员会正、副主任。
