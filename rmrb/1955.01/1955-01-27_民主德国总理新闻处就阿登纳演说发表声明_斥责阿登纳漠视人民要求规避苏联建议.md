Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 25th. The Press Office of the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement regarding Adenauer's radio address on January 22nd.

The statement condemned Adenauer for disregarding the legitimate demands of the German people and evading the proposals made by the Soviet government for a swift resolution of the German question, while falsely claiming that the Soviet government wanted to use the electoral law of the German Democratic Republic as the basis for all-German elections.

The statement pointed out that the government of the German Democratic Republic and the People's Chamber have stated more than once that they are ready at any time to discuss the issue of electoral law for all-German elections and are willing to begin negotiations without any preconditions.

Adenauer's blatant lies once again prove that under no circumstances is he willing to hold all-German elections, because he fears that the German people will express their opposition in this election to the policy of splitting Germany, to the re-militarization of West Germany and the Paris Accords, and will advocate the establishment of a unified, democratic, and peaceful Germany.

The statement concluded by pointing out that Adenauer is unwilling to abandon his plans for armament. He wants to continue down the path of America's "policy of strength." However, the German people will never relax their struggle against the Paris Accords. In order to defend peace and peacefully unify Germany, they will use all their strength to strive for all-German elections on the basis of all-German consultations.

    民主德国总理新闻处就阿登纳演说发表声明
    斥责阿登纳漠视人民要求规避苏联建议
      【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十五日讯：德意志民主共和国总理新闻处就阿登纳一月二十二日的广播演说发表了声明。
    声明斥责阿登纳漠视德国人民的正当要求并规避苏联政府为了迅速解决德国问题而提出的建议，却硬说苏联政府要把德意志民主共和国的选举法作为全德选举的基础。
    声明指出：德意志民主共和国政府和人民议院曾经不止一次地声明，它们准备随时协商全德选举的选举法的问题，并且愿意在没有任何先决条件的情况下开始谈判。
    阿登纳的明显的谎言又一次证明了：不管在什么条件下他都不愿意举行全德选举，因为他害怕德国人民会在这次选举中表示反对分裂德国的政策，反对西德重新军国主义化和巴黎协定，而主张建立一个统一、民主、和平的德国。
    声明最后指出：阿登纳不愿放弃武装的计划。他想继续走美国的“实力政策”的道路。但是德国人民绝不放松他们反对巴黎协定的斗争。为了保卫和平和和平地统一德国，他们要用全力争取在全德协商的基础上进行全德选举。
