    Introduction to the Contents of the Chinese Edition of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!", 1954, Issue 52

    The Chinese edition of the Information Bureau of Communist and Workers' Parties' organ, "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!", 1954, Issue 52, has been published.

    This issue features an editorial entitled "Heighten the Vigilance of the People, Strictly Guard Against the Conspiracies of the Enemies of Peace." The editorial points out: In 1954, world tensions saw some easing. However, the reactionary groups of the United States and Britain and their Western European partners are intensifying their efforts to obstruct the easing of international tensions, engaging in incitement and division among various countries and groups of countries. They are intensifying the arms race, establishing military blocs against democratic and socialist countries, and using atomic and hydrogen weapons to threaten these countries. Under the command of the ruling circles of the United States, the governments of several Western European countries have signed the so-called Paris Agreement. All this has created a new international situation that seriously endangers peace and the security of the people of all countries. In this situation, the people must greatly heighten their vigilance and strictly guard against the conspiracies of the enemies of peace. The countries of the socialist camp cannot tolerate this situation, cannot be unprepared; they must take all necessary measures to defend the peaceful labor of their people, to defend the sacred and inviolable borders and territory of their countries.

    This issue publishes the full text of Comrade N.S. Khrushchev's answers to questions from British scientists and public figures John Bernal, and also publishes German Communist Party Chairman Lehmann's article entitled "The German Communist Party Opposes the Revival of German Militarism," Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee Member Morawski's article entitled "Mass Political Work During the Elections of the Polish People's Congress," and the "Program of the Spanish Communist Party" adopted at the Fifth Congress of the Spanish Communist Party, etc.

    Lehmann's article points out: Due to Adenauer's signing of the Paris Agreement, due to the refusal of Western countries' governments to hold a meeting on restoring German unification and establishing European collective security, and due to the Adenauer government's refusal of all proposals from the German Democratic Republic to promote mutual understanding, the situation has undergone new changes. The purpose of the Paris Agreement is to revive German militarism, and the implementation of these agreements will cause new and even greater disasters for the German people. Therefore, the major task of the German Communist Party at present is, on the one hand, to explain the dangers of the Paris Agreement to the residents, and on the other hand, to publicize the path pointed out by the declaration of the European countries' conference on guaranteeing European peace and security to the working class and all other strata of residents. We must first establish the unified action of the West German working class, and unite all peace advocates and patriots in West Germany to form a powerful front to fight against the Paris Agreement and against the revival of German militarism, and carry on the struggle against German monopoly capitalists, militarists and their Adenauer government until victory.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五四年第五十二期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五四年第五十二期中文版已经出版。
    本期以“提高人民的警惕，严防和平敌人的阴谋”为题发表社论。社论指出：一九五四年世界紧张局势有了某些缓和。但是，美英反动集团及其西欧的伙伴们正在加紧阻挠国际紧张局势的缓和，在各个国家之间、在各个国家集团之间进行挑拨离间。它们正在加紧进行军备竞赛，建立反对民主国家和社会主义国家的军事集团，并且用原子武器和氢武器来威胁这些国家。在美国统治集团的指挥下，若干西欧国家的政府已经签订了所谓巴黎协定。这一切造成了严重危害和平和各国人民安全的新的国际局势。在这种形势下，人民必须大大提高警惕，严防和平敌人的阴谋。社会主义阵营国家不能容忍这种局势，不能无所准备；它们不得不采取一切必要措施来保卫本国人民的和平劳动，保卫本国的神圣不可侵犯的边疆和领土。
    这一期刊载了尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志答英国科学家和公众领袖约翰·贝尔纳问的全文，并且发表了德国共产党主席雷曼的题为“德国共产党反对复活德国军国主义”的文章，波兰统一工人党中央委员莫拉夫斯基的题为“波兰人民会议选举期间的群众政治工作”的文章，以及西班牙共产党第五次代表大会上通过的“西班牙共产党纲领”等。
    雷曼的文章指出：由于阿登纳签订了巴黎协定，由于西方国家的政府拒绝举行关于恢复德国统一和建立欧洲集体安全的会议，由于阿登纳政府拒绝德意志民主共和国提出的促进相互谅解的一切建议，局势发生了新的变化。巴黎协定的目的是复活德国军国主义，实施这些协定会给德国人民造成新的、甚至更大的灾难。因此，德国共产党当前的重大任务是，一面向居民说明巴黎协定的危险性，另一方面向工人阶级和所有其他阶层居民宣传保障欧洲和平和安全的欧洲国家会议的宣言所指出的道路。我们首先必须建立西德工人阶级的统一行动，并且团结西德一切和平拥护者和爱国者结成反对巴黎协定、反对复活德国军国主义的斗争的强大阵线，把反对德国垄断资本家、军国主义分子和他们的阿登纳政府的斗争一直进行到胜利为止。（新华社）
