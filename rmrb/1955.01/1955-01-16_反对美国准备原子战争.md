    Oppose America's Preparation for Atomic Warfare
    Tan Wenrui
    Recently, the American ruling clique's atomic war hysteria has intensified even further. They are now unscrupulously flaunting their plans to prepare for atomic warfare. For example, the commander of the U.S. Air Force stationed in the United Kingdom, Stevenson, believes that publicly announcing that his air division possesses atomic bombers ready to carry out "devastating air strikes" against the Soviet Union at any time is conducive to strengthening America's "policy of strength." Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford reminded people not to think that America's atomic war preparations are limited to the European region, saying: the United States is ready to "use atomic weapons" in Korea if necessary.
    The increasingly frequent atomic war clamoring by Washington officials has a clear purpose. They are attempting to use this constant clamoring and propaganda to force the people of the world to get used to the idea of using atomic weapons, in order to facilitate their preparations for atomic warfare. In fact, the United States is openly stepping up its preparations for atomic warfare.
    U.S. President Eisenhower publicly stated in the United Nations on December 8, 1953: "Atomic weapons have indeed gained conventional status in our various armed forces." To make atomic weapons standard equipment for all armed forces, the United States has spared no effort in the past year to expand the production of atomic weapons and strengthen the organization and training of the army based on the use of atomic weapons. The United States is investing more and more in the atomic industry for the production of war weapons, reaching 10 billion U.S. dollars. The U.S. military authorities are also preparing to conduct open, hypothetical atomic war exercises to train the U.S. military's combat capabilities in atomic warfare. Eisenhower, in his "State of the Union Address" delivered on January 6, indicated that the United States would continue to strengthen its efforts in this regard, saying: the military budget he is about to propose focuses on "new weapons, especially new weapons with rapid and devastating attack power," and emphasized that the United States will "continue to improve and expand our supply of nuclear weapons for the Army, Navy, and Air Force."
    The North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting held in Paris not long ago was an important sign of the United States' open preparation for atomic warfare. Under the arrangement and manipulation of the United States, this meeting actually made a decision to prepare for atomic warfare. Although the communique issued by the meeting used vague words such as "taking into account the modern developments in weapons and technology" when referring to the Council's approval of a report from the Military Committee, in order to conceal those unspeakable and evil plans, Western newspapers have revealed one after another that at this meeting, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries agreed to accelerate war preparations based on the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons. Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, who attended the meeting, publicly confirmed at a press conference: "The North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council agreed to the military's request, they requested permission to prepare for atomic warfare. As a result, they got this permission." This means that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries are turning themselves into bases for the United States to prepare for atomic warfare.
    The United States' stepped-up expansion of atomic armaments is in line with the new war preparation plans it is promoting around the world. Recently, the United States has used various methods in Europe to try to force the parliaments of France and other Western European countries to approve the Paris Agreements, so as to begin rearming West Germany and establishing a Western European aggressive bloc as soon as possible; in Asia, after signing the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, it is planning to create a Northeast Asian aggressive bloc, while attempting to strengthen the war preparation pace of the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc. The United States not only wants to establish atomic reserves in the "Western European Union" established under the Paris Agreements, but also prepares to equip the reconstructed West German aggressive army with atomic and hydrogen weapons. On the other hand, establishing atomic bombing bases on the island chain in the Pacific has always been an important part of the United States' war preparation plans in the Far East. The U.S. "Christian Science Monitor" pointed out on December 20 last year, when talking about the "new face" of the U.S. war preparation policy: the U.S. ruling clique in Europe is "preparing to openly and unreservedly rely on atomic weapons as the basis of their strength," while in Asia, it will "rely on the attack power of highly mobile naval and air forces." This shows that although the U.S. ruling clique has long lost its monopoly on atomic and hydrogen weapons, it has not abandoned its dream of relying on these weapons of mass destruction to dominate the world.
    The U.S. act of normalizing atomic weapons is a blatant violation of international conventions and a criminal act against humanity. Every conscientious person in the world demands the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons. The principle of prohibiting the use of weapons of mass destruction was, in fact, recognized by more than 50 countries in the Geneva Protocol signed on June 17, 1925, and the United States is also a signatory to this international agreement. At the first United Nations General Assembly held in 1946, a resolution was also passed to establish the Atomic Energy Commission, stipulating that one of the main tasks of this commission was to promote "the elimination of atomic weapons and all other major weapons of mass destruction from national armaments." However, the U.S. ruling clique completely disregarded all of this and even wants to make these weapons of mass destruction conventional military equipment like rifles and grenades. This also shows that in order to achieve its aggressive and war aims, the U.S. aggressive clique is attempting to abandon the solemn international documents it has signed and use atomic weapons to bring infinite disasters to the people of all countries. This anti-human practice of the United States has already and will continue to arouse the firm opposition of the vast number of people in the world, including more and more good people. Conscientious people from all walks of life in the world will not allow the U.S. aggressive clique's brutal policy to proceed smoothly. The U.S. aggressive clique is stepping up its transformation into an enemy of all mankind.
    People should know that atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons are barbaric weapons of mass destruction, but they are not a magic weapon for winning wars. Many military strategists have admitted that it is not any kind of weapon but people that determine the outcome of a war. Only the power of the people's army fighting for justice is invincible.
    The Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries have enough strength to defeat any aggressor, no matter what time, place and weapons these aggressors choose. Washington's atomic war instigators should remember the warning that Comrade Malenkov gave them last April: "If the aggressive bloc relies on atomic weapons and is determined to act recklessly and wants to taste the power and strength of the Soviet Union, then there is no doubt that the aggressor will also be countered by the same weapons, and this adventure will inevitably lead to the collapse of the capitalist social system."
    It is especially dangerous for Western European countries such as Britain to follow the United States' atomic war policy. Giving their territory to the United States to serve as a base for atomic attacks will make them the first to suffer devastating blows in the future war prepared by the United States. Many clear-headed people in Western Europe have long foreseen this terrible prospect. British Labor Party leader Aneurin Bevan recently said: "Now everyone admits that the beginning of a war with atomic and hydrogen weapons means the destruction of Great Britain, which is undeniable. It is now generally recognized that dropping a hydrogen bomb near the English Channel would wipe out the entire southern part of Western Europe and England..." French Socialist Party member Moke also said during the French National Assembly's debate on the Paris Agreements: "Three years ago, it would have taken six thousand atomic bombs to destroy all the people of France, today only fifteen hydrogen bombs would be enough." These remarks are obviously not an exaggeration. Therefore, it is particularly inconsistent with the interests of the British people that British military leaders like Montgomery are frantically clamoring for atomic warfare.
    While the U.S. aggressive clique is doing its best to prepare for atomic warfare, it is also talking about using atomic energy for peaceful purposes. It is clear at a glance that the United States is trying to deceive and paralyze the people of the world. In fact, the Soviet Union has already begun to use atomic energy for peaceful purposes. The Soviet Union's first atomic energy industrial power station is already transmitting electricity for industry and agriculture. Now, the Soviet Union will also submit a report on this power station and its operation to the international conference discussing the peaceful uses of atomic energy. People can see from this who is truly working hard for the peaceful use of atomic energy.
    The people of the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries will never be intimidated by the heinous acts of the U.S. aggressive clique, but they will not relax their vigilance against the atomic war planners. We will stand together with peace-loving countries and people around the world, resolutely oppose and defeat the U.S. aggressive clique's anti-human atomic war plan that is being prepared, and fight to ban atomic weapons and eliminate the threat of atomic war. We warmly support the Japanese people's ongoing movement demanding the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons. The massacre that once happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki must never be allowed to be repeated in other parts of the world!

    反对美国准备原子战争
    谭文瑞
    最近以来，美国统治集团的原子战争歇斯底里比过去更加加剧了。他们现在毫无顾忌地炫耀他们准备原子战争的计划。例如美国驻在英国的空军司令史蒂文森，就认为公开宣布他的空军师拥有准备随时向苏联进行“毁灭性空袭”的原子轰炸机，是有利于加强美国的“实力政策”的。美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福则提醒人们不要以为美国的原子战争准备只局限在欧洲地区，他说：美国准备好必要时在朝鲜“使用原子武器”。
    华盛顿负责官员越来越多的原子战争叫嚣有一个明显的目的。他们企图用这种不断的叫嚣和宣传来强迫世界人民习惯于使用原子武器的说法，以便于他们准备原子战争。事实上，美国正在公开地加紧准备原子战争。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔在一九五三年十二月八日就曾在联合国中公开说：“原子武器在我们各种武装部队中确实获得了常规地位。”为了使原子武器成为所有武装部队的标准装备，美国一年来不遗余力地扩大原子武器的生产和在使用原子武器的基础上加强军队的组织和训练。美国对生产战争武器的原子工业的投资越来越大，已达到一百亿美元。美国军事当局并准备作公开的假想原子战演习来训练美国军队在原子战争中的作战能力。艾森豪威尔在一月六日发表的“国情咨文”中，表示美国将继续加强在这方面的努力，他说：他就要提出的军事预算所侧重的是“新武器，特别是具有迅速的和毁灭性的攻击力量的新武器”，并且强调美国将“继续改善和扩大我国陆、海、空军的核子武器的供应。”
    不久以前在巴黎举行的北大西洋集团理事会会议是美国公开准备原子战争的重要标志。这个会议在美国的安排和操纵下竟作出了准备原子战争的决定。尽管会议发表的公报在谈到理事会批准了军事委员会的一个报告时，用了“估计到武器和技术方面的近代发展”这样含混的字句，来掩盖那些见不得人的罪恶计划，但是西方国家的报纸都已纷纷透露，在这一个会议上，北大西洋集团各国同意了在使用原子武器和氢武器的基础上加速备战活动。参加会议的比利时外交部长斯巴克就曾在记者招待会上公开证实说：“北大西洋集团理事会答应了军人们的所求，他们要求允许准备原子战争。结果他们得到了这种允许了。”这就是说，北大西洋集团各国正在使自己变成为美国准备原子战争的基地。
    美国加紧扩充原子军备，是和美国在全世界推行的准备新战争计划相配合的。美国最近在欧洲便用了各种办法企图强迫法国和其他西欧国家的议会批准巴黎协定，以便尽早着手重新武装西德和建立西欧侵略集团；在亚洲，和蒋介石卖国集团签订了美蒋“共同防御条约”之后，正在计划制造一个东北亚侵略集团，同时企图加强东南亚侵略集团的备战步调。美国不仅要在根据巴黎协定建立起来的
  “西欧联盟”中建立原子储备，而且准备用原子武器和氢武器来装备重建的西德侵略军队。另一方面，在太平洋的岛屿锁链上建立原子轰炸基地，一直是美国在远东准备战争计划的重要一环。美国“基督教科学箴言报”去年十二月二十日谈到美国备战政策的“新面貌”时也指出：美国统治集团在欧洲“准备公开地无保留地倚靠原子武器作为它们力量的基础”，在亚洲则“将倚靠有高度机动性的海空军的攻击力量”。这说明了，美国统治集团虽然早已丧失了原子武器和氢武器的垄断地位，他们仍然没有放弃依仗这些大规模毁灭性武器来独霸世界的迷梦。
    美国把原子武器常规化的行径，是明目张胆地违反国际公约、违反人道的罪恶行为。全世界每一个有良心的人都要求禁止使用原子武器。禁止使用大规模毁灭性武器的原则，事实上在一九二五年六月十七日签订的日内瓦议定书中就已为五十多个国家所承认，美国也是这个国际协定的一个签字国。在一九四六年举行的第一届联合国大会，还曾通过设立原子能委员会的决议，规定这个委员会的一个主要任务是促成“从国家军备中取消原子武器及一切其他大规模毁灭性的主要武器”。但是美国统治集团却把这一切完全置之不顾，竟然要把这种大规模毁灭性武器作为同步枪、手榴弹等一样的常规军备。这还说明美国侵略集团为了达到它的侵略目的和战争目的，企图背弃它已经签字的庄严的国际文件，使用原子武器来带给各国人民无限灾难。美国的这种反人类的做法，已经而且必将继续激起世界广大人民，包括越来越多的善良人民的坚决反对。世界上有良心的各阶层人士将不能容许美国侵略集团的这种残暴政策顺利进行。美国侵略集团正在加紧把它自己变成全人类的公敌。
    人们应该知道，原子武器和氢武器是一种大规模毁灭性的野蛮武器，但是却不是赢得战争的法宝。许多军事战略家都已承认，决定战争的结局的不是任何种类的武器而是人。只有为了正义而战斗的人民的军队的威力才是无敌的。
    苏联和人民民主国家有足够的力量来击败任何侵略者，不管这些侵略者选择什么时间，地点和武器。华盛顿的原子战争挑拨者应当记住马林科夫同志去年四月间对他们所作的警告：“如果侵略集团仰仗原子武器，决心蛮干，想尝一尝苏联的力量和威力，那末，不必怀疑，侵略者也将遭到同样武器的反击，而这种冒险必不可免地使资本主义社会制度崩溃。”
      英国等西欧国家追随美国的原子战争政策，尤其是危险的。它们把自己的领土给美国充当原子攻击的基地，将会使它们在美国所准备的未来战争中，首先遭到毁灭性的打击。西欧许多头脑清醒的人物早已预见到这种可怕的前景。英国工党领袖安奈林·比万最近说过：“现在每一个人都已承认，在原子和氢武器的战争的开始阶段就意味着大不列颠的毁灭，这是无可否认的。现在已经公认，在英伦海峡附近投掷一枚氢弹，就将会扫平整个西欧和英伦的南部……”法国社会党议员莫克在法国国民议会辩论巴黎协定时也说：“三年前要六千个原子弹才能消灭法国全体人民，今天只要十五个氢弹就够了。”这些言论都显然不是过分夸张的。因此，像蒙哥马利这样的英国军事领袖也发狂似地在叫嚣原子战争，就特别不符合英国人民的利益。
    美国侵略集团在极力准备原子战争的同时，还在讲什么将原子能使用于和平目的。一眼就能看清，美国是想欺骗和麻痹世界人民。事实上，苏联却已经开始将原子能使用于和平目的。苏联第一个原子能工业电力站已经在为工业和农业输送电力。现在，苏联还要向讨论和平利用原子能国际会议提出关于这个电力站及其工作情况的报告。人们从这里看到谁是在真正为和平利用原子能而努力。
    苏联、中国和各人民民主国家的人民决不会被美国侵略集团穷凶极恶的行径所吓倒，但是也不会放松对原子战争策划者的警惕。我们将和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民在一起，坚决反对和击败美国侵略集团正在准备的反人类的原子战争计划，为禁止原子武器、消除原子战争威胁而斗争。我们热烈声援日本人民正在展开的要求禁止原子武器和氢武器的运动。决不许曾经发生在广岛和长崎的大屠杀在世界其他地方重演！
