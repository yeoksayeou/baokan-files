    Stalin City
    Tian Jian
    Before talking about Stalin City, I want to talk about the Buchenwald concentration camp in Germany.

    Buchenwald is on a small hill near Weimar. There is a forest here. In 1932, German fascists built a concentration camp in this forest. Prisoners arrested in Poland were quickly transported here; also, people that other prisons couldn't hold were sent here.

    The concentration camp had a large iron gate with the words "To Each His Own" written on it. After entering the gate, there were rows of prison cells. Each prison cell had a small iron door and iron windows. It could be said to be an iron prison. Not far from the prison cells was a basement. On one side of the cement wall in the basement, there were hooks all around; in this small room, there were thirty-two hooks. After one prisoner was forced to hang himself, another prisoner would take down his body and put his own neck on the hook. When they were hanged, the executioners broadcast: "The cause of death is lung disease."

    On the other side of the basement, there were two large furnaces, each with six fire doors. After a person died, the body would be thrown into the furnace. There is no need for me to explain further, isn't this the most brutal killing factory in the world? A hell?

    A great German worker, German revolutionary leader – Comrade Thälmann, died in this concentration camp, and his body was burned here by thugs. His execution ground is right here. We came here to commemorate this great deceased person, and we placed two bouquets of flowers in front of his execution ground.

    On the small hill of Buchenwald, from 1932 to 1945, more than 250,000 people were imprisoned, and more than 55,000 people died. Among them were Soviet people, Polish people, German people, French people, a total of thirty-three nationalities.

    During the days when these heroic warriors were imprisoned and slaughtered, this period, as Comrade Thälmann said, proved their loyalty to the socialist cause, "emitting the living fire of his soul" ("Thälmann's Testament from Prison").

    On the iron door of cell number 23, we saw a pastor's portrait hanging there, his name was Smetdel. It was this pastor who once stood on the small bed in the cell, holding the iron window with both hands, and shouting for freedom to the outside.

    "I have no longing at all
    For this vast paradise.
    That is not true paradise,
    Where there is a forbidden tree.
    I call for complete freedom,
    As long as there is a little restraint.
    Turn my paradise,
    Immediately into prison and sorrow."

    "We want to build,
    A heaven on earth!"
                – Lines from the German poet Heine

    On another small mountain in Germany, on and under the mountain, there is a heaven, a world made of steel and iron. Thälmann's legacy is emitting fire here. – This is Stalin City of the German Democratic Republic, the first socialist city.

    In Stalin City, there are five blast furnaces, standing on one side of the Oder River bank. On the street, the white stone pillars and the lights on the pillars are like stars on the Oder River. This seems to be a door leading to the steel mill.

    The steel mill is the source of peaceful life. People here are full of vigor, walking the path they want to walk, and nothing can stop them. It is cultivating the fruit trees of happiness.

    Four years ago, this was a pine forest, a large forest; but not long after, the world has changed, and now it is a forest of steel. People in this forest are going to become communists, and they are going to climb from this forest to the highest peak in the world.

    Even now, as I hold the pen, I still can't forget a person in Stalin City, a worker, Schmidt Eiwell. Eiwell's optimistic laughter, humorous words, and the black hair on his head are all in my memory.

    "For the working people, it is imperative to build communism. – This is our only way. No other way will work!"

    "All my knowledge was learned in these three years, mathematics, political economy." Eiwell told me this.

    "What political theory books have you read?" I asked him.

    "I have read Comrade Stalin's articles on socialist economic issues. Workers can understand Stalin's books at a glance, and what he says is what the workers want to say."

    "I have also read the books written by Pavlov and Filipov (Soviet metallurgy expert). I have started reading 'Das Kapital.' It's a bit slower to read. I am still a student at a spare-time school, attending school four times a week. I am still a student."

    Eiwell calls himself a student, which is partly true and partly modest. In the past, he was an ordinary worker. After coming to Stalin City, he changed from a team leader, a smelting furnace foreman, to an expert.

    He is a participant in the Hennecke movement. Hennecke is the first labor model in the German Democratic Republic. Hennecke said two sentences like this: "Produce more first, then live a good life." These two sentences have become very famous slogans. Eiwell also often promotes these two sentences among his companions.

    Eiwell is forty-one years old and has been a worker since he was a child. Since coming to Stalin City, he has made many rationalization proposals for the steel mill. Improving the equipment of the smelting furnace has increased production efficiency by 50% on the original basis. In addition, he has organized the phenomenon of each worker managing their own affairs into collective action. Therefore, he has been rewarded three times and joined the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in the factory.

    When his suggestion had not yet been realized, some people were skeptical: "Are you crazy?" His answer was: "I am not crazy. Please try it."

    "When did you come to Stalin City?" I asked him.

    He happily described this event:

    "This was in 1950. At that time, there were still pine forests here. Stalin City was just born. I grew up with it. I saw socialism and internationalism here. – Polish coal, Soviet ore and experts, give us peaceful steel industry."

    "Where did you come to Stalin City from?"

      "Before 1948, I was still working in the British occupation zone. Before leaving the British occupation zone, the British told me, stay in West Germany, West Germany is much better than East Germany. I said I don't believe it, I want to go back and see. East Germany is my hometown."

    "Now I know that our party is the home of the workers, and it cares about the fate of every worker. Here, every worker has a study card, and the party is watching this card. If it finds someone who has not made progress, it will ask: Do you want to study?"

    Yes. Labor and learning are very important things for people; without them, it is equal to losing one's rights. I can mention in passing that there is a middle school next to the square, which is a very good middle school. Undoubtedly, this is set up by the party for the children of workers.

    Its characteristic is that it values the atmosphere of labor. When we walk from downstairs to upstairs, we can see a large mural, all stone carvings, occupying half of the corridor. The story on the painting is that fishermen are casting their nets and fishing by the river. Seeing this mural makes people want to be a fisherman.

    On the walls of the classroom hang portraits of Thälmann, Michurin, Heine and Hennecke. In one place, Hennecke's portrait is very, very large, and it is written with his famous saying "Produce more first, then live a good life."

    This middle school also has various laboratories, a small iron factory, several textile machines, and many plant specimens. Eiwell came to visit with us; our unanimous impression is that labor here is an important textbook for people.

    Eiwell and us also ate together at the workers' club. The architecture of the club is like a museum. At the entrance are two rows of large stone pillars, and upstairs there are eight large brown painted wooden pillars, with brass column tops on the wooden pillars. I admire that German workers are so good at using steel, stone and wood, and are really labor experts.

    From the window upstairs, we looked at the whole city. Eiwell pointed to the Oder River with one hand and to the blast furnace of the steel mill with the other. He told me that Stalin City is still under construction, and another blast furnace will be added between the blast furnace and the chimney this year.

    In a very short period of time, Eiwell and us became very close friends. His simple face, his heart loyal to socialism, and his unceremonious attitude made me very fond of him. We seemed to have met him a long time ago. I am very grateful to him, he gave me a lot of photos. I was afraid that he didn't have one left for himself, so I said that I would keep it for him, and if he needed it, he could write to Beijing to ask me for it.

    One photo is of him and his children sitting around a table, talking. There are bouquets of flowers on the table. Beside them is a portrait of Thälmann. This made me feel that Thälmann is not dead, he is looking at the flowers in the hearts of the German people – this socialist city of Stalin City!

    People who have been to Buchenwald and then to Stalin City can know how different the experiences and stories of the two small mountains and two forests in Germany are!

### 斯大林市

    斯大林市
    田间
    在没有说到斯大林市以前，我要先讲一讲德国的布痕瓦尔德集中营。
    布痕瓦尔德，在威玛附近的一座小山上。这里有一个森林。一九三二年，在这个森林里，德国法西斯建筑了一个集中营。他们在波兰逮捕的犯人，很快运到这里；还有，别的监狱关不下的人，也送到这里。
    集中营有一个大的铁门，门上写着“各得其所”。进门以后，便是一排一排的监房。每一个监房，有一个小的铁门，铁窗户。这里可以说是一个铁的牢狱。距监房不远的一个地方，有一个地下室。在地下室的一边水泥墙壁上，四面都是吊钩，在这个不大的房子里就安着三十二个吊钩；这一个囚犯被迫上吊以后，另一个囚犯解下他的尸首，自己就把颈子放到吊钩上。当他们上吊的时候，刽子手们广播说：“死的原因是肺病。”
    地下室的另一边，还有两个大的火炉，每一火炉都有六个火门，人死了以后，就把尸首掷到火炉里。这里，无须我多加说明，这难道不是世界上一个最残酷的杀人工厂吗？一个地狱吗？
    一个伟大的德国工人，德国革命领袖——台尔曼同志，就死在这个集中营，他的尸首，也在这里被暴徒焚毁。他的刑场就在这里呵。我们来到这里，为了纪念这位伟大的死者，在他的刑场前面，放上了两束鲜花。
    布痕瓦尔德这个小山上，从一九三二年到一九四五年，一共囚禁过二十五万多人，死难的有五万五千多人。其中有苏联人，有波兰人，有德国人，有法国人，一共有三十三个民族的人。
    这些英勇的战士，在他们被囚禁被屠杀的日子，这一段时间、正如台尔曼同志所说过的，证明了他们对于社会主义事业的忠心，“发射出他灵魂上的活火”（“台尔曼狱中遗书”）。
    在第二十三号监房的铁门上，我们看到一个牧师的遗像挂在那里，他的名字叫史梅得尔。就是这个牧师，曾经站在监房的小床上，双手扶着铁窗，向窗外高呼着自由。
    “我丝毫不留恋
    这广大的乐土。
    那不是真乐土，
    那儿有禁吃的果树。
    我呼吁完全自由的权利，
    只要有着些微的束缚。
    就把我的乐土，
    立刻变成监牢和愁苦。”
    “我们要在地上，
    建筑起天国！”
                ——德国诗人海涅的诗句
    在德国另一个小的山，山上和山下，有了一个天国，一个用钢和铁做的世界。台尔曼的遗志，在这里发射出火光。——这就是德意志民主共和国的斯大林市，第一个社会主义的城市。
    在斯大林市，有五个高炉，耸立在奥得河河岸的一边。大街上，那白的石柱和石柱上的灯，像是奥得河上的星星。这儿好像是个门，通到炼钢厂。
    炼钢厂，这是和平生活的源泉。人在这儿，精神勃勃，走他要走的路，没有什么能阻挡他们。它在培植幸福的果树。
    四年以前，这里是一个松树林，是一个大的森林；可是时间并没有多久，已经换了一个世界，现在是一个钢铁的森林。人在这个森林中，要成为共产主义的人，他要从这个森林上，攀到世界的最高顶。
    直到现在当我拿着笔的时刻，我还念念不忘斯大林市的一个人、一位工人，史密特·艾威尔。艾威尔乐观的笑声，幽默的话语，和他头上的黑发，都在我的记忆中。
    “对劳动人民来说，非建设共产主义不可。——这是我们惟一的道路。其他的路不能走！”
    “我所有的知识，是在这三年当中学的，数学、政治经济学”。艾威尔他对我这么说。
    “你读过些什么政治理论书？”我问他。
    “斯大林同志写的，关于社会主义经济问题的文章，我已经读过。斯大林的书，我们工人一看就能懂，他说的话，是工人们要说的话。”
    “我还读过巴甫洛夫，菲立勃夫（苏联冶金业专家）写的书。‘资本论’我开始在看哩。看得要慢一些。现在我还是业余学校的学生，每星期上四次学。我还是个学生。”
    艾威尔自称是一个学生，这个话，一部分是事实，一部分也是谦虚。过去他是一个普通工人，到斯大林市来以后，由组长、冶业炉工长，变成一个专家。
    他是海涅克运动的参加者。海涅克是德意志民主共和国第一位劳动模范。海涅克说过两句这样的话：“先要多生产，然后过好生活。”这两句话，已经成了很有名的口号。艾威尔在他底同伴当中，也经常宣传这两句话。
    艾威尔四十一岁，自小就是一个工人。自从到斯大林市以后，他对炼钢厂的合理化建议，是很多的。改善冶铁炉的设备，把生产效力从原有基础上，提高了百分之五十。此外，他又把工人中各管各的现象，组织成为集体行动。因此，三次受到奖励，在工厂里加入了德国统一社会党。
    当他的建议还没有实现时，有的人很怀疑：“你疯了吗？”他的回答是：“我并没有疯。请你们试一试。”
    “你是什么时候到斯大林市来的呢？”我问他。
    他快乐地叙述这一件事：
    “这是在一九五○年。那时这儿还有松树林。斯大林市刚刚诞生。我是和它一同长大的。我在这儿看见了社会主义，国际主义。——波兰的煤矿、苏联的矿石和专家，给我们和平的钢铁工业。”
    “你是从哪儿到斯大林市来的？”
      “一九四八年以前，我还在英占区做工，离开英占区以前，英国人对我说，留在西德吧，西德比东德好得多。我说我不信，我要回去看看。东德是我的故乡。”
    “现在我知道，我们的党，是工人的家，它关心每一个工人的命运。在这儿，每一个工人，都有一张学习卡片，党在看着这张卡片，发现谁没有进步，它就要问：你要不要学习？”
    是的。劳动和学习，对于人来说，是很重要的事；没有它，也等于失去了人的权利。我可以顺便说一下，广场的旁边，有一所中学，这是很好的中学。无疑的，这是党为工人子弟设立的。
    它的特点是重视劳动的风气。当我们从楼下走到楼上时，可以看见一幅很大的壁画，全部是石雕，占着半个走廊，画上的故事是，渔夫撒着渔网，正在河边捕渔。看见这幅壁画，使人想要去做一个渔夫。
    在教室的墙上，挂着台尔曼、米丘林、海涅和海涅克的像。有一个地方，海涅克的像，很大很大，并且写着他底名言“先要多生产，然后过好生活。”
    这个中学还有各种实验室，有一个小的铁工厂，几台纺织机，许多植物标本。艾威尔和我们一起来参观；我们一致的印象是，劳动在这里，是人的一本重要的教科书。
    艾威尔又和我们一起，在工人俱乐部吃饭。俱乐部的建筑，如同一个博物馆。门口是两排大的石柱，楼上又有八根大的棕色油漆木柱，木柱上是黄铜做的柱顶。我很赞美，德国的工人是这样善于运用钢铁、石头和木头，实在是劳动的能手。
    从楼上的窗口，我们望着全城。艾威尔一手指着奥得河，一手指着炼钢厂的高炉，他告诉我，斯大林市还正在建设，在高炉和烟囱之间今年还要增加一个高炉。
    在一个很短的时间内，艾威尔和我们成了很熟的朋友。他那朴素的面孔，忠于社会主义的心，以及不讲客套的态度，使我很喜欢，我们和他仿佛早就见过面似的。我很感谢他，他送给我很多照片。我怕他自己一张也没有留，我说我替他保存着，假使他需要的时候，可以写信到北京来向我要。
    有一张照片，是他和孩子们围着一张桌子坐着，正在谈话，桌子上摆着一束一束的鲜花。在他们的身旁，便是台尔曼的像。这使我感到，台尔曼没有死，他在望着德国人民心上的鲜花——这社会主义的城斯大林市！
    到过布痕瓦尔德的人，再到斯大林市看一下，就可以知道，德国的两座小山上、两个森林里，它的经历，它的故事，是多么的不相同啊！
