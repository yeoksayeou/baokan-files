    Tractor Stations Bring Bumper Harvests to Farmers
    Last year, thirteen agricultural machine tractor stations in Heilongjiang Province, including those in Huachuan, Jixian, and Shuangcheng, cultivated over 38,000 hectares of land for ten collective farms and 424 agricultural production cooperatives, resulting in universally abundant harvests. According to statistics, the yield of land cultivated by the stations was, on average, about 30% higher than that cultivated with old-fashioned farm tools, and in some cases, it was more than double. The Huachuan Tractor Station cultivated over 890 hectares of paddy rice for four collective farms, including Xinghuo and Liaoyuan. The average yield per hectare was over 4,400 kilograms, greatly increasing the income of the farmers, with an average income of 14 million yuan per worker per year. The Ning'an Tractor Station cultivated over 100 hectares of soybeans for the Tuanshanzi Collective Farm, with an average yield of 2,000 kilograms per hectare, which was more than 60% higher than the yield of local agricultural production cooperatives. The fact that tractor stations increased production through cultivation has powerfully promoted the development of cooperation. In the base area served by the Huachuan Tractor Station, more than 95% of farmers have joined collective farms and agricultural production cooperatives.
    Currently, all agricultural machine tractor stations are actively carrying out winter studies and machine maintenance, striving to produce more grain this year. (Jia Guozhi, Miao Yuwen)

    拖拉机站给农民带来了丰收
    黑龙江省桦川、集贤、双城等十三个农业机器拖拉机站，去年给十个集体农庄、四百二十四个农业生产合作社代耕的三万八千多垧土地，普遍获得丰收。据统计，各站所代耕的土地的产量平均比旧式农具耕种的高百分之三十左右，有的还高达一倍以上。桦川拖拉机站给星火、燎原等四个集体农庄代耕的八百九十多垧水稻，每垧平均产八千八百多斤，大大增加了庄员的收入，平均每个劳动力一年可收入一千四百万元。宁安拖拉机站给团山子集体农庄代耕的一百多垧大豆平均每垧产四千斤，比当地农业生产合作社产量高百分之六十以上。各拖拉机站代耕增产的事实，有力的促进了合作化的发展。桦川拖拉机站服务的基点区有百分之九十五以上的农户参加了集体农庄和农业生产合作社。
    目前各农业机器拖拉机站正积极的开展冬季学习以及检修机器等工作，争取今年增产更多的粮食。（贾国治　苗玉文）
