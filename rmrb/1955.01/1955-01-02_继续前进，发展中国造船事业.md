    Continue to Advance and Develop China's Shipbuilding Industry
    Yuan Xianqian, Manager of State-owned Dalian Shipbuilding Company
    The Sino-Soviet Dalian Shipbuilding Company has now victoriously overfulfilled the 1954 production plan assigned by the Chinese and Soviet governments, and in the short period since the release of the Sino-Soviet Joint Communiqu√©, has completed preparations for transferring the Soviet shares in this joint venture to China. Simultaneously, with the enthusiastic assistance of Soviet experts, it has been preparing for the 1955 production.

    The Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company was established on January 1, 1952, based on the original Dalian Shipyard, according to an agreement between the Chinese and Soviet governments. Three years is not a long time for a ship building and repair enterprise. However, due to the special care of the Party and the governments of China and the Soviet Union, and the direct guidance and enthusiastic assistance of Soviet experts, this enterprise has been transformed into a new type of socialist enterprise in our country, and has become a powerful force for the development of China's shipbuilding industry.

    According to the basic construction plan stipulated by the Sino-Soviet shareholders' meeting, in the past three years, workshops for fitting, shipbuilding, hull, pipe and copper work, tools, electroplating, daily necessities, and machinery repair, as well as oxygen and power stations, have been newly built and renovated. Docks, slipways, and wharf roads and railways have been repaired. A large number of new equipment and machine tools have been put into production. In particular, several large machine tools specially needed for shipbuilding and ship repair industries, as well as automatic and semi-automatic welding machines and cutters, and various transportation and lifting tools have been greatly increased. Heavy manual labor has gradually been replaced by mechanization, and the entire factory has taken on a new look. This has greatly improved the overall layout of the company, nearly doubling the production area of the workshops, making it possible to appropriately arrange the normal production of shipbuilding and ship repair simultaneously, and creating conditions for the rational adjustment of production, auxiliary, and preparation workshops and the maximization of the efficiency of various equipment, as well as preparing a good working environment for workers. As a result, the production capacity and labor efficiency have been significantly improved over the past three years. Taking the total production value in 1952 as 100, it was 123.2 in 1953, and further increased to 136 in 1954.

    On the basis of production development, the welfare undertakings for employees have also been developing day by day. A nursery that can accommodate more than 300 children, a hospital fully equipped with the latest equipment, and a workers' village with sixteen three-story buildings have been newly built and expanded. In addition, a technical school has been established to train new skilled workers.

    It should be particularly pointed out here that the large-scale expansion and renovation work that our company has undertaken has been carried out without affecting the normal progress of the original production, and at the same time, the basic construction tasks have been completed according to the prescribed schedule to meet the requirements of production development. Moreover, the funds used by the company to expand the enterprise are the company's own accumulation. All employees of the company use the accumulation created by their labor to expand their own enterprises and improve working conditions and welfare undertakings.

    In the three years of joint operation of the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company, thanks to the direct guidance and selfless assistance of Soviet experts, the principles of the Soviet socialist management of shipbuilding enterprises have been applied, and in combination with the specific conditions of the company, a set of effective advanced systems and methods have been creatively formulated and implemented. This is a model of learning and applying Soviet experience. Everyone knows that the cycle of completing the repair and construction of a ship is long, the construction projects are very complex, and the amount of labor and material consumption is very large. It is necessary to scientifically determine and effectively control the scope and value of the repair, so as to organize the construction rhythmically. This is a very difficult task. In order to solve this problem, Soviet experts helped us establish regulations for order placement and handover, as well as systems and methods for inspection and valuation. In this way, we can start from accepting ship repair orders, inspecting according to the detailed list provided by the orderer, confirming the scope and specific items of the repair, and estimating the price based on it, preparing a budget, and signing a contract with the orderer based on it to determine the final price and completion date. Therefore, this not only provides a basic basis for our company's production activities, but also makes it possible to supervise the production and cost of the entire ship and the entire set of components or parts, determine the amount of labor and material consumption, and reasonably prepare workshop construction order forms, fundamentally creating the possibility of organizing production rhythmically and economically. The Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company issued an order on job planning in the first month of its establishment in 1952. Over the past three years, it has vigorously promoted job planning, which has greatly advanced the company's production management work.

    At the same time, Soviet experts attach great importance to improving and strengthening production technology preparation, because the most effective measure to shorten the very long production cycle of shipbuilding and ship repair is to vigorously strengthen production preparation. However, this is a deeper and more difficult step than promoting job planning. In the past three years, a lot of work has been done in this regard, necessary institutions have been added, and a system and dedicated personnel for technical management have been established from the company to the workshop. All drawings have been uniformly adopted in Soviet specifications, and a standard design team has been specially set up to formulate the company's own standard designs, main technological regulations, standard tool designs and manufacturing, and consumption quotas. Coupled with the establishment of the aforementioned valuation and inspection system, set-up ordering, parallel operations, and many other improvements in production management, a good foundation has been created for further improving production technology preparation in the future, and will have a significant effect on improving product quality and shortening the production cycle. In addition, the production area management system was implemented at the beginning of the company's establishment, various responsibility systems were established, the piecework system was vigorously promoted, quality was strictly supervised, economic activities were supervised, labor conditions were improved, labor efficiency was improved, and advanced systems and methods in various aspects such as equipment and machinery maintenance were implemented. Also, thanks to the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, many advanced experiences of the Soviet Union in shipbuilding, ship repair, machining, metallurgy and other fields have been adopted. This has greatly improved the management and technical level of Chinese employees.

    In the past three years, Soviet experts have fully demonstrated the spirit of great internationalism in the huge task of teaching and training Chinese employees, which is deeply moving. The Soviet experts in our company all undertake certain practical work and have heavy tasks. But for the past three years, they have been tirelessly and unreservedly using various opportunities and methods to impart their rich knowledge to Chinese employees and contribute to China's shipbuilding industry. They often tell us that teaching Chinese comrades is their responsibility and their greatest pleasure and honor. The Chinese employees of the company have established all levels of committees to learn from the Soviet Union. In the past three years, from leading organs to grassroots workshop units, from leading cadres to general employees, extensive and systematic learning from the Soviet Union has been carried out. The Soviet general manager and chief engineer personally review the teaching plans and materials of the experts in various departments. Soviet experts teach while doing, personally demonstrate, and patiently explain. Chinese employees not only learn advanced technology and experience from them, but also learn their excellent work style.

    Soviet experts attach great importance to improving the cultural and technical level of workers, and attach importance to training cadres from workers. They often tell us that China must have experts from Chinese workers. In the past three years, with the help of Soviet experts, thousands of technical and management cadres above the workshop level have been cultivated from within the company. Among the section chiefs and workshop directors, 65% have been trained and promoted from ordinary workers. They love their work and have gradually been trained to become cadres who are familiar with their own business and have a certain ability to work independently. Therefore, we can say that the process of the three years of joint operation of the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company is not only a process of close cooperation between Chinese and Soviet comrades to complete the common glorious task, but also a process in which Chinese employees learn from Soviet experts and continuously improve their technical and professional levels. The Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company has been formed into a new type of comprehensive enterprise for ship repair and shipbuilding in our country, and has become an important force for the development of China's shipbuilding industry. In the past three years, the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company has built and repaired hundreds of ships for China and the Soviet Union, and has gloriously completed the tasks given by the governments of China and the Soviet Union.

    The Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company will be changed to the State-owned Dalian Shipbuilding Company from January 1, 1955. We are very happy. We must maintain and carry forward all the achievements that the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company has achieved. We must diligently and conscientiously continue to manage this enterprise well and never fail the advanced honor of this enterprise.

    After the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company ceases joint operation, the Soviet government will provide technical assistance to the Dalian Shipbuilding Company. In 1955, all personnel of our Dalian Shipbuilding Company will still work with Soviet experts. This will enable our Dalian Shipbuilding Company to continue to directly accept and apply the principles of Soviet socialist shipbuilding enterprises, and to grow and strengthen more rapidly. We must take all measures to ensure the implementation of the experts' suggestions.

    We must continue to manage this enterprise well, and maintain and carry forward the excellent traditions of the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company. We must further implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party's Central Committee, vigorously strengthen political and ideological work, raise socialist thinking, eliminate capitalist thinking, strengthen the thinking of our enterprise leading cadres and all employees on relying on the Party, strengthen the connection with the masses, oppose individualism, oppose complacency, strengthen discipline education, strengthen political theory learning, and carry out self-criticism and criticism, strengthen collective life and collective leadership.

    We must also learn from Soviet experts, who are not only technically excellent experts, but also politically strong comrades.

    China's shipbuilding industry will not only develop along with all of China's socialist industries, but will also largely reflect this overall development. Because modern ships need to absorb the various technological achievements in the various departments directly or indirectly participating in the shipbuilding industry, we must learn from relevant enterprises and shipbuilding brother enterprises across the country, and achieve close cooperation with them.

    The Dalian Shipbuilding Company will be expanded in the next few years, and Soviet experts will help us with design and construction. In a few years, a larger and more modern shipyard will appear before us. Therefore, while completing the production plan, we must also complete the basic construction plan. We must also adapt to the requirements of the products after the expansion of the factory and rapidly cultivate technical forces.

    Our great motherland has thousands of kilometers of coastline and many navigable rivers. With the development of our country's economic construction, the people increasingly need sea and inland waterway ships. The 600 million people of the whole country have achieved brilliant achievements in the first two years of working selflessly for the motherland's first five-year plan. We will enter the new and victorious 1955 with full confidence together with the people of the whole country. We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions:
  ‚ÄúStrive to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, be honest, diligent, mutually encourage and help each other, and avoid any exaggeration and pride." For the consolidation and development of the shipbuilding industry of the Chinese people, for the establishment of a strong fleet of modernized sea and inland waterways in our country, for supporting the liberation of Taiwan, and for the peace of the Far East and the world, we must better shoulder the arduous task of building socialist enterprises given to us by the Party and the state.
