    Continue to Advance and Develop China's Shipbuilding Industry
    Yuan Xianqian, Manager of State-owned Dalian Shipbuilding Company
    The Sino-Soviet Dalian Shipbuilding Company has now victoriously overfulfilled the 1954 production plan assigned by the Chinese and Soviet governments, and in the short period since the release of the Sino-Soviet Joint Communiqué, has completed preparations for transferring the Soviet shares in this joint venture to China. Simultaneously, with the enthusiastic assistance of Soviet experts, it has been preparing for the 1955 production.

    The Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company was established on January 1, 1952, based on the original Dalian Shipyard, according to an agreement between the Chinese and Soviet governments. Three years is not a long time for a ship building and repair enterprise. However, due to the special care of the Party and the governments of China and the Soviet Union, and the direct guidance and enthusiastic assistance of Soviet experts, this enterprise has been transformed into a new type of socialist enterprise in our country, and has become a powerful force for the development of China's shipbuilding industry.

    According to the basic construction plan stipulated by the Sino-Soviet shareholders' meeting, in the past three years, workshops for fitting, shipbuilding, hull, pipe and copper work, tools, electroplating, daily necessities, and machinery repair, as well as oxygen and power stations, have been newly built and renovated. Docks, slipways, and wharf roads and railways have been repaired. A large number of new equipment and machine tools have been put into production. In particular, several large machine tools specially needed for shipbuilding and ship repair industries, as well as automatic and semi-automatic welding machines and cutters, and various transportation and lifting tools have been greatly increased. Heavy manual labor has gradually been replaced by mechanization, and the entire factory has taken on a new look. This has greatly improved the overall layout of the company, nearly doubling the production area of the workshops, making it possible to appropriately arrange the normal production of shipbuilding and ship repair simultaneously, and creating conditions for the rational adjustment of production, auxiliary, and preparation workshops and the maximization of the efficiency of various equipment, as well as preparing a good working environment for workers. As a result, the production capacity and labor efficiency have been significantly improved over the past three years. Taking the total production value in 1952 as 100, it was 123.2 in 1953, and further increased to 136 in 1954.

    On the basis of production development, the welfare undertakings for employees have also been developing day by day. A nursery that can accommodate more than 300 children, a hospital fully equipped with the latest equipment, and a workers' village with sixteen three-story buildings have been newly built and expanded. In addition, a technical school has been established to train new skilled workers.

    It should be particularly pointed out here that the large-scale expansion and renovation work that our company has undertaken has been carried out without affecting the normal progress of the original production, and at the same time, the basic construction tasks have been completed according to the prescribed schedule to meet the requirements of production development. Moreover, the funds used by the company to expand the enterprise are the company's own accumulation. All employees of the company use the accumulation created by their labor to expand their own enterprises and improve working conditions and welfare undertakings.

    In the three years of joint operation of the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company, thanks to the direct guidance and selfless assistance of Soviet experts, the principles of the Soviet socialist management of shipbuilding enterprises have been applied, and in combination with the specific conditions of the company, a set of effective advanced systems and methods have been creatively formulated and implemented. This is a model of learning and applying Soviet experience. Everyone knows that the cycle of completing the repair and construction of a ship is long, the construction projects are very complex, and the amount of labor and material consumption is very large. It is necessary to scientifically determine and effectively control the scope and value of the repair, so as to organize the construction rhythmically. This is a very difficult task. In order to solve this problem, Soviet experts helped us establish regulations for order placement and handover, as well as systems and methods for inspection and valuation. In this way, we can start from accepting ship repair orders, inspecting according to the detailed list provided by the orderer, confirming the scope and specific items of the repair, and estimating the price based on it, preparing a budget, and signing a contract with the orderer based on it to determine the final price and completion date. Therefore, this not only provides a basic basis for our company's production activities, but also makes it possible to supervise the production and cost of the entire ship and the entire set of components or parts, determine the amount of labor and material consumption, and reasonably prepare workshop construction order forms, fundamentally creating the possibility of organizing production rhythmically and economically. The Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company issued an order on job planning in the first month of its establishment in 1952. Over the past three years, it has vigorously promoted job planning, which has greatly advanced the company's production management work.

    At the same time, Soviet experts attach great importance to improving and strengthening production technology preparation, because the most effective measure to shorten the very long production cycle of shipbuilding and ship repair is to vigorously strengthen production preparation. However, this is a deeper and more difficult step than promoting job planning. In the past three years, a lot of work has been done in this regard, necessary institutions have been added, and a system and dedicated personnel for technical management have been established from the company to the workshop. All drawings have been uniformly adopted in Soviet specifications, and a standard design team has been specially set up to formulate the company's own standard designs, main technological regulations, standard tool designs and manufacturing, and consumption quotas. Coupled with the establishment of the aforementioned valuation and inspection system, set-up ordering, parallel operations, and many other improvements in production management, a good foundation has been created for further improving production technology preparation in the future, and will have a significant effect on improving product quality and shortening the production cycle. In addition, the production area management system was implemented at the beginning of the company's establishment, various responsibility systems were established, the piecework system was vigorously promoted, quality was strictly supervised, economic activities were supervised, labor conditions were improved, labor efficiency was improved, and advanced systems and methods in various aspects such as equipment and machinery maintenance were implemented. Also, thanks to the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, many advanced experiences of the Soviet Union in shipbuilding, ship repair, machining, metallurgy and other fields have been adopted. This has greatly improved the management and technical level of Chinese employees.

    In the past three years, Soviet experts have fully demonstrated the spirit of great internationalism in the huge task of teaching and training Chinese employees, which is deeply moving. The Soviet experts in our company all undertake certain practical work and have heavy tasks. But for the past three years, they have been tirelessly and unreservedly using various opportunities and methods to impart their rich knowledge to Chinese employees and contribute to China's shipbuilding industry. They often tell us that teaching Chinese comrades is their responsibility and their greatest pleasure and honor. The Chinese employees of the company have established all levels of committees to learn from the Soviet Union. In the past three years, from leading organs to grassroots workshop units, from leading cadres to general employees, extensive and systematic learning from the Soviet Union has been carried out. The Soviet general manager and chief engineer personally review the teaching plans and materials of the experts in various departments. Soviet experts teach while doing, personally demonstrate, and patiently explain. Chinese employees not only learn advanced technology and experience from them, but also learn their excellent work style.

    Soviet experts attach great importance to improving the cultural and technical level of workers, and attach importance to training cadres from workers. They often tell us that China must have experts from Chinese workers. In the past three years, with the help of Soviet experts, thousands of technical and management cadres above the workshop level have been cultivated from within the company. Among the section chiefs and workshop directors, 65% have been trained and promoted from ordinary workers. They love their work and have gradually been trained to become cadres who are familiar with their own business and have a certain ability to work independently. Therefore, we can say that the process of the three years of joint operation of the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company is not only a process of close cooperation between Chinese and Soviet comrades to complete the common glorious task, but also a process in which Chinese employees learn from Soviet experts and continuously improve their technical and professional levels. The Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company has been formed into a new type of comprehensive enterprise for ship repair and shipbuilding in our country, and has become an important force for the development of China's shipbuilding industry. In the past three years, the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company has built and repaired hundreds of ships for China and the Soviet Union, and has gloriously completed the tasks given by the governments of China and the Soviet Union.

    The Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company will be changed to the State-owned Dalian Shipbuilding Company from January 1, 1955. We are very happy. We must maintain and carry forward all the achievements that the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company has achieved. We must diligently and conscientiously continue to manage this enterprise well and never fail the advanced honor of this enterprise.

    After the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company ceases joint operation, the Soviet government will provide technical assistance to the Dalian Shipbuilding Company. In 1955, all personnel of our Dalian Shipbuilding Company will still work with Soviet experts. This will enable our Dalian Shipbuilding Company to continue to directly accept and apply the principles of Soviet socialist shipbuilding enterprises, and to grow and strengthen more rapidly. We must take all measures to ensure the implementation of the experts' suggestions.

    We must continue to manage this enterprise well, and maintain and carry forward the excellent traditions of the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company. We must further implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party's Central Committee, vigorously strengthen political and ideological work, raise socialist thinking, eliminate capitalist thinking, strengthen the thinking of our enterprise leading cadres and all employees on relying on the Party, strengthen the connection with the masses, oppose individualism, oppose complacency, strengthen discipline education, strengthen political theory learning, and carry out self-criticism and criticism, strengthen collective life and collective leadership.

    We must also learn from Soviet experts, who are not only technically excellent experts, but also politically strong comrades.

    China's shipbuilding industry will not only develop along with all of China's socialist industries, but will also largely reflect this overall development. Because modern ships need to absorb the various technological achievements in the various departments directly or indirectly participating in the shipbuilding industry, we must learn from relevant enterprises and shipbuilding brother enterprises across the country, and achieve close cooperation with them.

    The Dalian Shipbuilding Company will be expanded in the next few years, and Soviet experts will help us with design and construction. In a few years, a larger and more modern shipyard will appear before us. Therefore, while completing the production plan, we must also complete the basic construction plan. We must also adapt to the requirements of the products after the expansion of the factory and rapidly cultivate technical forces.

    Our great motherland has thousands of kilometers of coastline and many navigable rivers. With the development of our country's economic construction, the people increasingly need sea and inland waterway ships. The 600 million people of the whole country have achieved brilliant achievements in the first two years of working selflessly for the motherland's first five-year plan. We will enter the new and victorious 1955 with full confidence together with the people of the whole country. We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions:
  “Strive to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, be honest, diligent, mutually encourage and help each other, and avoid any exaggeration and pride." For the consolidation and development of the shipbuilding industry of the Chinese people, for the establishment of a strong fleet of modernized sea and inland waterways in our country, for supporting the liberation of Taiwan, and for the peace of the Far East and the world, we must better shoulder the arduous task of building socialist enterprises given to us by the Party and the state.

    继续前进，发展中国造船事业
    国营大连造船公司经理  原宪千
    大连中苏造船公司现在已胜利的超额完成了中苏两国政府所交付的一九五四年生产计划，并在中苏会谈公报发表后短短的时期内作好了将这一合股公司中苏联股份移交给中国的准备工作。同时，在苏联专家的热情帮助下，进行了一九五五年的生产准备工作。
    中苏造船公司是根据中苏两国政府协议，于一九五二年一月一日在原大连船渠工厂的基础上创建起来的。对于轮船建造和修理企业来说，三年并不算一个长的时间，然而这个企业由于党和中苏两国政府的特殊关怀，由于苏联专家的直接指导和热诚帮助，已经形成为我国一个社会主义的新型企业了，成为我国发展造船工业的强大力量。
    依照中苏股东会议所规定的基本建设计划，三年来新建和改建了钳工、造船、船体、管子铜工、工具、镀金、日用品、机械修理等车间和氧气、动力等站。整修了船坞和造船台以及码头道路和铁路。为数很多的新式设备和机床投入了生产，特别是对造船和修船工业有特殊需要的数台大型机床以及自动与半自动电焊机和切割器，各种运输工具和起重工具大大增加了，繁重的体力劳动亦逐渐为机械化所代替，全厂面貌为之一新。这样就使公司整个布置大大改善，车间生产面积几乎增加一倍，有可能同时适当的布置造船和修船的正常生产，并为生产、辅助、准备等车间合理调整和最大限度的发挥各种设备效率创造了条件，也为工人准备了好的劳动环境。因而生产能力和劳动效率三年来有了显著的提高，以一九五二年生产总值为一○○，则一九五三年为一二三点二，一九五四年又增加到一三六。
    在生产发展的基础上，职工福利事业也日益发展。新建和扩建了一个可容三百余儿童的托儿所，一座完全用最新式设备装备起来的医院，新建造了一个拥有十六幢有三层楼房的工人村。此外还建立了为培养新的技术工人的技工学校。
    在这里应该特别提出的是：我们公司所曾经进行的较大规模扩建和改建工作，都是在既不影响原来生产的正常进行，又要按规定进度完成基本建设任务满足生产发展要求的情况下进行的。同时，公司用以扩大企业的资金是公司本身的积累。公司全体职工用他们劳动所创造的积累来扩大自己企业，改善劳动条件和福利事业。
    中苏造船公司在三年的合营过程中，由于苏联专家的直接指导和无私的帮助，运用了苏联社会主义管理造船企业的原则，结合公司的具体情况，创造性地制订了和实行了一套行之有效的先进制度和方法。这是学习和运用苏联经验的典范，大家都知道完成修理和建造一艘船只的周期较长，工事项目十分庞杂，劳动量和材料消耗为数很大，科学地确定并有效地控制其修理范围和价值，以便有节奏的组织施工是十分必要的，这是相当艰巨的工作。为了解决这个问题，苏联专家帮助我们建立了订货交接条例以及检修和估价的制度和办法。这样就使我们从接受修船订货，按订货主所交付的明细书进行检修，确认其修理范围和具体项目，并根据它进行估价，编制预算书，并据此与订货主签订合同，确定最后价格和完工期限。因此，这不仅使我们公司生产活动有了基本的依据，并且有可能对整条船舶以及整套部件或零件的生产和成本进行监督，确定其劳动和材料消耗量，合理的编制车间施工命令单，从根本上为有节奏的节约的组织生产创造了可能。中苏造船公司一九五二年成立的第一个月份就发布了有关作业计划的命令，三年来大力推行作业计划，使公司生产管理工作大大向前推进了一步。
    同时，苏联专家十分重视改善和加强生产技术准备工作，因为缩短为时很长的造船和修船的生产周期的最有效的措施，乃是大力加强生产准备工作，但这比之于推行作业计划来说，则又是更深更难的一步。三年来在这方面进行了许多工作，增加了必要的机构，从公司到车间建立了技术管理方面的一套系统和专责人员。所有图纸已一律采用苏联的规格，并专设标准设计小组，制订了公司自己的标准设计、主要工艺规程、标准工具的设计和制造、规定消耗定额等，加上前述的估价与检修制度的建立、成台订货和平行作业等其他许多生产管理工作的改进，就为今后进一步改善生产技术准备工作创造了良好的基础，并将对提高产品质量和缩短生产周期起着显著的功效。此外，在公司一开始即实行了生产区域管理制，建立了各种责任制，大力推行了计件工作制，严格监督质量，监督经济活动，改善劳动条件，提高劳动效率，维修设备和机器等各方面的先进制度和方法。还由于苏联专家的热心帮助，苏联在造船、修船、机械加工、冶金等各方面的许多先进经验已被采用。这样就大大提高了中国职工的管理水平和技术水平。
    三年来苏联专家在教导和培养中国职工这一巨大工作中，充分表现了伟大国际主义的精神，感人至深，我公司的苏联专家都担负着一定的实际工作，任务繁重。但三年来一直是不疲倦的毫无保留的利用各种机会和方法把他们丰富知识传授给中国职工，贡献给中国造船事业，他们经常告诉我们说，教会中国同志是他们的责任，是他们最大的愉快和光荣。公司中国职工成立了各级向苏联学习委员会，三年来从领导机关到车间基层单位，从领导干部到一般职工都进行了广泛的和有系统的向苏联学习。苏联总经理，总工程师亲自审查各科室专家教学计划和材料，苏联专家边做边教，亲自示范，耐心讲解，中国职工不仅向他们学习先进技术和经验，而且向他们学习优良的工作作风。
    苏联专家十分重视提高工人的文化和技术水平，重视培养工人出身的干部，他们经常告诉我们说，中国必须有中国工人出身的专家。三年来，在苏联专家的帮助下，数以千计的工段以上的技术和管理干部，绝大部分是由公司内部成长起来的。科长和车间主任当中，百分之六十五是从普通工人中培养和提拔起来的，他们热爱自己的工作，并逐渐锻炼成为熟习自己的业务并具有一定独立工作能力的干部。因此，我们可以说，三年来中苏造船公司合营的过程，不仅是中苏两国同志在一起为完成共同的光荣任务而亲密合作的过程，同时也是中国职工向苏联专家学习，不断提高技术水平和业务水平的过程。中苏造船公司已经形成为我国的一个新型的修船和造船的综合企业，成为我国发展造船工业的一项重要力量。中苏造船公司三年来为中苏两国建造和修理了数百艘船舶，光荣地完成了中苏两国政府给予的任务。
    中苏造船公司将自一九五五年一月一日起改为国营大连造船公司，我们感到十分高兴，我们一定要保持和发扬中苏造船公司已获得的一切成就，我们必须勤勤恳恳，兢兢业业，继续管理好这个企业，绝不能辜负这个企业的先进荣誉。
    在中苏造船公司停止合营后，苏联政府将给大连造船公司以技术援助，一九五五年我们大连造船公司全体人员仍将和苏联专家在一起工作。这就使我们大连造船公司能继续直接地接受和运用苏联社会主义造船企业的原则，能够更加迅速地成长和壮大。我们一定要采取一切措施保证贯彻专家的建议。
    我们要继续管理好这个企业，要保持和发扬中苏造船公司优秀的传统。我们就必须进一步贯彻党的四中全会精神，大力加强政治思想工作，提高社会主义思想，肃清资本主义思想，加强我们企业领导干部及全体职工依靠党的思想，更密切和群众的联系，反对个人主义，反对骄傲自满情绪，加强纪律教育，加强政治理论学习，展开自我批评和批评，要加强集体生活和集体领导。
    我们还必须要向苏联专家学习，他们不仅是技术优秀的专家，而且是政治上很强的同志。
    中国造船事业不仅随同我国所有社会主义工业一道发展，而且颇大程度上将反映出这个总的发展。因为现代船舶要吸收直接或间接参加造船工业各有关部门中的各种技术成就，所以我们必须向全国有关企业和造船兄弟企业学习，和他们取得密切协作。
    大连造船公司在今后数年内将进行扩建，苏联专家并将帮助我们进行设计和施工。在数年后在我们眼前将会出现一个规模更加宏大的近代化造船厂。因此，我们在完成生产计划的同时，还必须完成基本建设计划。我们还必须适应扩厂后产品的要求，迅速培养技术力量。
    我们伟大祖国有数千公里长的海岸线，有许多条适航的河流，随着我国经济建设的发展，人民日益需要海上和内河的航行船舶。全国六亿人民在为着祖国的第一个五年计划而奋不顾身的头二年劳动中，已取得了辉煌的成就。我们将和全国人民一道满怀信心地进入新的胜利的一九五五年。我们一定要遵照毛主席的指示：
  “努力学习苏联和各兄弟国家的先进经验，老老实实，勤勤恳恳，互勉互助，力戒任何的虚夸和骄傲”，为了中国人民造船事业的巩固和发展，为了建立我国有近代化装备的海上和内河的强大船队，为了支援解放台湾，为了远东和世界的和平，我们一定更好的担负起党和国家给予我们建设社会主义企业的艰巨工作。
