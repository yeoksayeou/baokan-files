    Activities of Party Organizations in Various Regions
    **Recruiting Outstanding Members into the Party**
    The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China is actively engaged in organizational construction, having recruited over 12,700 outstanding individuals from the masses into the Party in the past year. In the past, the foundations of some grassroots Party organizations in Wuhan were relatively weak, especially within the vast basic construction teams, where there were few Party members and the Party organizations were not sound. Through active development and rectification over the past year, more than 2,400 new Party members have been developed in the basic construction system, and more than 230 branches have been established. More than 800 new Party members have been developed in the cultural and educational system. In the industrial production system, where the original Party organization foundation was stronger, more than 3,700 new Party members have also been developed. Before joining the Party, these new Party members generally underwent training in various political reform movements and production campaigns, and received education in communism and the Communist Party, possessing a certain degree of communist consciousness.
    When Wuhan encountered an unprecedented flood, the Municipal Committee immediately organized more than 7,000 Party members to directly participate in flood prevention and rescue operations, and established Party organizations within various flood prevention organizations. These Party organizations combined flood prevention efforts with ideological education work for the masses, enabling existing activists to be tested and improved, and new activists emerged in large numbers. More than 8,000 new Party members were recruited during this flood prevention effort.
    After joining the Party, the vast majority of new Party members, under the direct leadership and education of the branch, were able to unite the masses to strive to complete the specific tasks of the Party and the state at various stages. When Wuhan shifted from flood prevention to the increase production and practice economy campaign, Guo Jintang, an alternate Party member of the first work zone of the Fourth Engineering Company, led the earth and stone team to actively promote the advanced method of "contracting earth excavation in layered and segmented ditches," which more than doubled the earth excavation progress required by the leadership. Under their active leadership, the vast majority of workers in this work zone paid attention to the promotion of advanced experience, universally breaking the original quota and overfulfilling the October 1954 construction plan, becoming an advanced unit in the city.
    In response to the large number of new Party members joining the Party, the Wuhan Municipal Committee has determined that the current focus of organizational work is to continue to strengthen the education of alternate Party members to further improve their awareness. At the same time, the district committees will hold training classes for Party branch committee members and group leaders, and the municipal Party school will be responsible for training branch secretaries to strengthen the leadership of grassroots Party organizations.

    **Developing Party Organizations in Construction Projects**
    The Committee of the Third Engineering Bureau of the New Construction Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways actively carried out communist education for employees during the construction of the "Jining-Erlian" railway line in 1954, which improved the class consciousness of employees, developed Party organizations, and effectively promoted the completion of production tasks. In the past year, 236 new Party members have been accepted, and a group of activists has also been cultivated. Workers accounted for 80 percent of the new Party members, and many of them were model workers and advanced workers. Among them were Liu Wen, a driver who insisted on staying at his post even after his hands and feet were frostbitten due to continuous engine starts in the severe cold of minus 40 degrees Celsius; Liu Haijin, a worker who created the herringbone stone lifting machine; and Nan Zizhou, a worker who used his body to block the flood to rescue road-building materials. Through Party building education, a few relatively backward workers have also improved their understanding, reviewed their shortcomings, and expressed their determination to move forward with everyone.

    **Learning Lessons from the Incident of Landlords Seizing Leadership of Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives**
    Last autumn, when Dacheng County, Hebei Province, was developing agricultural producers' cooperatives, some landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries pretended to be active and infiltrated the cooperatives to carry out sabotage activities. For example, Li Shuzhen, a landlord from Fengzhuang in the Second District, wormed his way into the cooperative and became an accountant. He seized on the shortcomings of the cooperative director's impatient nature and spread rumors among the members that the director was a carter and could not be a director, thereby seizing the position of director. Later, he used the name of the cooperative to fraudulently purchase 470 kilograms of state wheat seeds and encouraged members not to repay agricultural loans that were due. Under his scheme, he also expelled three poor peasant members from the cooperative.
    Based on the above situation, the Dacheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed all districts to conduct an education on the Party's class line in the countryside for both new and old members. For the 12 cooperatives with more complex situations, such as Fengzhuang, the county committee directly sent cadres to help rectify them. The landlord element Li Shuzhen in the Fengzhuang cooperative was purged, and after education on the class line, the members' thinking stabilized, and the cooperative expanded to 20 households. The general cooperatives throughout the county have also been consolidated and expanded through education on the class line. (Xu Zhen)
    **Focus on Establishing Neighborhood Party Classes**
    The Sixth District of Xuchang County and the Third District of Xin'an County in Henan Province are focusing on establishing neighborhood Party classes. The Xuchang County Committee of the Communist Party of China in the Sixth District has established a neighborhood Party class system with Hezhuang, Luozhuang, and Nianshang townships as the focus, with a district committee member specifically responsible for leading it. A Party class learning committee was formed, mainly composed of the branch secretaries of these three townships, to manage Party class learning affairs. They determined that the Party class should be held once every half a month, taking the branch as a unit, and a large class should be convened for all Party members in the neighborhood once a month. The main content of the Party class is based on the eight questions of Party member standards and the policies and guidelines of mutual aid and cooperation, combined with the ideological situation of Party members for education. Each study also absorbs Party development targets and branch committee members of the Communist Youth League to participate.
    The Xin'an County Committee of the Communist Party of China in the Third District, in accordance with the spirit of the county committee's organizational work meeting and in combination with the current work situation of the branches in the entire district, divided the district into five neighborhoods and established Party class transmission stations, which are responsible for the division of labor by the district committee, and the Party class is held once a month. It was also decided to hold a meeting of township branch secretaries once a month to summarize the experience of the Party class and check the implementation of the Party class system, and to formulate an outline for the next month's Party class lectures.

    **Propaganda Representatives' Meeting Discusses Propaganda for the Liberation of Taiwan**
    From December 17 to 21 last year, the CPC Huainan Municipal Committee of Anhui Province convened the city’s Second Propaganda Representatives’ Meeting to deploy propaganda work concerning the liberation of Taiwan. It was decided that from late December of last year to mid-January of this year, all propagandists would be organized to vigorously publicize the issue of liberating Taiwan. At the meeting, the Director of the Provincial Propaganda Department gave a report on the issue of liberating Taiwan, which was followed by discussion. The representatives also exchanged propaganda experiences. (Liu Dengyu)

    各地党组织的活动
    吸收优秀分子入党
    中共武汉市委积极进行组织建设，一年来吸收了群众中的优秀分子一万二千七百多人入党。过去，武汉市有些党的基层组织的基础比较薄弱，特别在巨大的基本建设队伍中，党员很少，党的组织也不健全。经过一年来的积极发展和整顿，在基本建设系统中，已发展了两千四百多名新党员，建立了二百三十多个支部。在文化教育系统中发展了八百多名新党员，在原来党的组织基础较强的工业生产系统中，也发展了三千七百多名新党员。这些新党员入党前，一般都经受了各项政治改革运动和生产运动的锻炼，并受到了共产主义和共产党的教育，具有了一定程度的共产主义觉悟。
    当武汉市遭遇到百年未有的洪水时，市委立即组织了七千多名党员直接参加防汛抢险斗争，并在各级防汛组织中建立了党的组织。这些党组织结合防汛斗争，对群众进行了思想教育工作，使原有积极分子得到了考验和提高，新的积极分子又大量生长起来，并在这次防汛斗争中，吸收了八千多名新党员。
    新党员入党以后，他们在支部的直接领导和教育下，绝大多数能团结群众为完成党和国家在各个时期的具体任务而奋斗。当武汉市由防汛转入增产节约运动时，第四工程公司第一工区的候补党员郭进堂领导的土石队积极推广了“分层分段包干地槽”挖土的先进方法，使挖土进度超过领导上要求的定额一倍以上。在他们积极带动下，这个工区绝大多数的工人都注意起推广先进经验，普遍突破原定额，超额完成了一九五四年十月份建设计划，成为全市的先进单位。
    针对大批新党员入党的情况，武汉市委确定当前组织工作的重点是，继续加强对候补党员的教育，进一步提高他们的觉悟；同时由各区委举办党的支部委员和小组长训练班，由市委党校负责训练支部书记，以加强党的基层组织的领导。

    在建设工程中发展党组织
    中共铁道部新建工程总局第三工程局委员会在一九五四年度修建“集二”线工程中，积极向职工进行共产主义教育，提高了职工的阶级觉悟，发展了党的组织，并有力地推动了生产任务的完成。一年来接收了新党员二百三十六名，还培养了一批积极分子。新党员中，工人成分占百分之八十，并有不少是劳动模范和先进工作者。其中有在零下四十多度的严寒中因连续发动机器冻坏手脚还坚守岗位的司机刘文，有创造人字吊石机的工人刘海金，有用自己身体挡住洪水抢救筑路器材的工人南子周等等。经过建党的教育，少数比较落后的工人也提高了认识，检讨了自己的缺点，表示决心和大家一起前进。　（高粮）
    从地主窃夺农业生产合作社领导的事件中取得教训
    去年秋天，河北大城县发展农业生产合作社时，有些地主、富农和反革命分子假装积极，混进了社里进行破坏活动。如二区冯庄地主李树侦，钻到社里当了会计，他抓住社长性子急的缺点，向社员散布社长是赶大车的把式，当不了社长，从中窃夺了社长职位。以后并以社的名义套购国家麦种四百七十斤，鼓动社员不归还到期的农业贷款，在他的策谋下还开除了三户贫农社员出社。
    中共大城县委根据以上情况，指示各区对新老社员普遍进行一次党在农村阶级路线的教育。对于情况较复杂的冯庄等十二个社，县委直接派干部去帮助整顿。冯庄社的地主分子李树侦被清洗出去，又经过阶级路线的教育，社员思想稳定了，社也扩大到了二十户。全县一般社，经过阶级路线的教育，也都得到巩固和扩大。　（徐珍）
    重点建立小区党课制
    河南许昌县六区、新安县三区重点建立小区党课制。中共许昌县六区区委会以贺庄、罗庄、碾上三个乡为重点建立了小区党课制，由一个区委委员具体负责领导，并以这三个乡的支部书记为主，组成了党课学习委员会，管理党课学习事务。他们确定以支部为单位，每半月上党课一次，每月召集小区全体党员上大课一次。党课主要内容是以党员标准的八个问题和互助合作的方针政策为主，结合党员的思想情况进行教育。每次学习并吸收党的发展对象和团的支部委员参加。
    中共新安县三区区委会，根据县委组织工作会议精神，结合全区支部当前的工作情况，划分五个小区，建立了党课传授站，由区委分工负责，每月上党课一次。并决定每月召开一次乡支部书记会议，总结党课经验和检查党课制度的执行情况，拟定下月党课讲授的提纲。

    宣传员代表会讨论解放台湾的宣传
    中共安徽淮南市委于去年十二月十七日至二十一日，召开了全市第二次宣传员代表会议，布置了关于解放台湾的宣传工作。决定自去年十二月下旬至今年一月中旬，组织全体宣传员，大张旗鼓地宣传关于解放台湾问题。会上，听取了省委宣传部部长关于解放台湾问题的报告，并展开了讨论，大家还交流了宣传经验。　（刘登宇）
