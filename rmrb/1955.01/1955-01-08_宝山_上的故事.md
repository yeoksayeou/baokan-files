Stories on "Treasure Mountain"
　　Liu Heng　Wang Dan

The exploration team of Team 241 is grateful to the herdsmen, and the herdsmen are also grateful to the exploration team.

The exploration team said that the herdsmen helped them dig wells in the icy and snowy weather, guided them on the boundless grasslands, and fought wolves and captured bandits with them in the dark; they also sent them cream, milk curd, taught them how to prevent wolves, helped them build yurts, and the women sewed felt piece by piece...

When the herdsmen mentioned the exploration team, they couldn't stop talking. Herdsmen such as Gaboloma, Buda, Daoerji, and Puerlai also told us a story of "sending the dog":

　　Comrade, look at our mountain, what a great "treasure mountain" it is! This mountain is gold, it is pearls.

　　It is said that a long, long time ago, this "treasure mountain" was in a very, very distant large forest. The large forest was occupied by a demon, and our ancestors fought with the demon to reclaim the "treasure mountain". Later, the "treasure mountain" was taken back and moved here. A brave general sacrificed in the war. To commemorate him, people built a large obo on "Treasure Mountain" and buried his remains, swords, and armor.

　　Every year in June and July, people from far and near come to worship, a small sacrifice every year, and a large sacrifice every three years, with whole cattle and sheep as sacrifices. We burn incense for the obo, kowtow to the obo, and some people throw a stone at the obo while praying: "Throw a stone at the obo, increase the happiness of the herdsmen by one point..."

　　We remember that we have never had a good day since we were born. In 1939, the Japanese devils brought us unspeakable disasters! They transported the treasures from our mountain away car after car. They robbed our horses, our sheep, and the jewelry of our women. They even robbed the cow dung we picked up to burn! They also took our people away!

　　However, "a strong horse cannot be subdued by anyone other than its master", the devils could not steal our "treasure mountain"! Later, the devils lost several lives and fled with their tails between their legs.

　　Then came the bandits, and the "Treasure Mountain" area became a "no-man's land".

　　No matter how good the grass is in the "no-man's land", people don't come, horses don't come, and gentle flocks of sheep don't come. In the "no-man's land", there are vicious wolves and bandits who are even more vicious than wolves!

　　In 1950, the People's Government was established here. We were shouting: "Liberation, emancipation!" Suddenly, we heard that Team 241 had come to "Treasure Mountain", like a thunderbolt from the blue! Everywhere people were shouting and yelling:

　　"Oh no! Oh no! Someone is coming to steal the treasure again!"

　　"They are planting red flags to occupy the land, and they are going to drive us away again!"

　　"They are drilling holes, digging ditches, destroying the feng shui..."

　　At this time, the cadres of the People's Government came down, and the cadres of Team 241 also came down. They rode horses, ran to one yurt after another, and promoted everywhere:

　　"Comrades, folks! We are not treasure thieves, we are treasure hunters! We will find the iron cattle and steel horses on the mountain, build railways, make machines, make sheep-shearing scissors, for everyone to use!"

　　"We plant red flags to mark the iron cattle and steel horses, for fear of not finding them in the future, not to occupy the land!"

　　"We are here to help you live a good life, a happy life, the feng shui is guaranteed not to be destroyed, and we will protect the obo well!"

　　"The People's Government does not allow beating people, does not allow driving people away, comrades, folks, welcome to move closer to us!"

　　What we remember most clearly is June 30th, when the sun was right overhead, a man came riding a horse from far away, the horse was riding like an arrow, and the man seemed to be growing on the horse. As soon as he ran to us, he shouted: "Comrades! Folks! Tomorrow is the birthday of Team 241, please come to eat!"

　　The next day - July 1st, many of us went. After going for the first time, there was a second time. We kept going, and more and more people went. Sometimes, people riding horses would pick us up to watch plays and movies. Sometimes, we would go ourselves, go shopping, buy books, and some people would go to see a doctor, and women would go to the health center to give birth to babies...

　　As the saying goes, "You can tell a good horse from a bad horse by taking it out for a stroll, and you can tell a good person from a bad person by living together for a long time." Later, many people simply moved their yurts, moving to three or five miles around "Treasure Mountain".

　　Who knew that not long after moving, something happened - the matter was caused by the dog!

　　You know, "Treasure Mountain" had become a "wolf den", and the workers were afraid of wolves, so they raised dozens of dogs. Later, there were no more wolves, but the dogs were still there. Once, a dog got into a herdsman's flock of sheep and bit two sheep to death. The captain of Team 241 heard about it and quickly gave the workers an order: "Send all the dogs away tomorrow, send them far away, get rid of them!" The workers couldn't bear it! They had watched these dogs grow up day by day, and they had fed them with their own hands, just like their own relatives. Some workers wanted to hide them in the drilling rig room. But, no, the captain had given an order! The next day, the workers had to personally send the dogs on a truck and transport them away!

　　Comrade, what else do you want us to say!

　　Last year, we invited several lamas and selected several representatives to move the obo to another quiet hilltop. Now, we have truly begun a happy life, and we will also work for industrialization and for a happier future.

    “宝山”上的故事
    刘衡　旺丹
    二四一队的勘探队员在感谢牧民，牧民也在感谢勘探队。
    勘探队员说，牧民在冰天雪地里帮他们打井，在茫茫无边的草原上给他们带路，在黑夜里，和他们一块儿打狼，捉土匪；还给他们送奶油、奶豆腐，讲授防狼的办法，帮他们搭蒙古包，妇女们一针一线地缝毡子……。
    牧民提起勘探队，话更说不完了。嘎波罗玛、布达、道尔基、普尔来等牧民还给我们讲了一个
  “送狗”的故事：
    同志，你看咱们这座山，是多好的一座大“宝山”！这座山就是金子，是珠子。
    据说在很久很久以前，这座“宝山”是在很远很远的大森林里。大森林被一个魔鬼占去了，我们的祖先为了要夺回“宝山”，跟魔鬼打了仗。后来，“宝山”被夺回来，移到这里。有一位勇敢的将军在战争中牺牲了。人们为了纪念他，就在“宝山”上建立一个大敖包，埋上他的尸骨、刀剑和盔甲。
    每年六、七月，远远近近的人都要跑来祭祀，一年一小祭，三年一大祭，祭品是整牛整羊。我们给敖包烧香，给敖包叩头，有的人还给敖包丢一块石头，一边丢，一边祈祷：“给敖包丢一块石头，给牧民增加一分幸福……”
    我们记得，我们有生以来，就没过过一天好日子。一九三九年，日本鬼子带给我们的，更是说不尽的灾难！把我们山上的宝贝一车一车地运走。他们抢我们的马，抢我们的羊，抢我们妇女的首饰。连我们拣的牛粪，他们都要抢了拿去烧！他们还拉去我们的人！
    可是，“不是主人骑不住骠马”，鬼子是盗不走我们的“宝山”的！后来，鬼子被我们打丧了几条命，夹着尾巴逃走了。
    接着是来了土匪，“宝山”一带成了“无人区”。
  “无人区”里草再好，人不来，马不来，和善的羊群都不来。“无人区”里，有凶恶的狼，有比狼还凶恶的土匪！
    一九五零年，这里建立了人民政府。我们正在喊：“解放啦，翻身啦！”忽然，听说“宝山”上开来了二四一队，就像从天上掉下来一颗大焦雷！到处都在嚷，都在叫：
      “不得了！不得了！又有人来盗宝啦！”
    “他们插红旗占地盘啦，又要赶我们走啦！”
      “他们钻洞呢，挖沟呢，破坏了风水……”
    正在这时候，人民政府派干部下来了，二四一队也派干部下来了。他们骑着马，跑了一个蒙古包，又跑一个蒙古包，到处宣传：
    “同志们，老乡们！我们不是盗宝的，是找宝的！我们把山上的铁牛钢马找出来，修铁路，造机器，造剪羊毛剪子，给大家用！”
    “我们插红旗是给铁牛钢马做记号，怕以后找不到它了，不是占地盘！”
    “我们来，是为大家过好日子，过幸福日子，风水保险破坏不了，敖包我们要好好保护！”
    “人民政府不兴打人，不兴赶人，同志们，老乡们，欢迎你们搬到跟前住！”
    我们记得最清楚的是六月三十日，太阳正当顶，远远来了个骑马的人，那马骑得跟射箭一样，人就像长在马身上似的。他一跑到我们跟前，就大叫：“同志们！老乡们！明天二四一队过生日，请大家吃饭！”
    第二天——七月一日，我们好些人都去了。去了头一次，就有第二次。我们不断地去，人越去越多。有的时候，是骑马的人接我们去，接我们去看戏、看电影。有的时候，是我们自己去，自己去买东西、买书，有的人还去看病，妇女们到卫生所生娃娃………
    俗话说得不错：“好马坏马牵出来蹓一蹓就知道，好人坏人住在一起天长日久就明白。”到后来，索性好些人把蒙古包搬去了，搬到离“宝山”周围三、五里。
    谁知道，刚刚搬去不久，就闹出了事——事情就是那狗惹的！
    你们晓得，“宝山”原先成了“狼窝”，工人怕狼，就养了几十条狗。后来狼没有了，狗还在。有一次，一头狗钻进一个牧民的羊群里，把两头羊咬死了。二四一队的队长听见了，赶忙给工人下命令：“明天把狗全部送走，送得远远的，丢掉！”工人们好不忍心啊！这狗是他们眼看着一天一天长大的，是他们一口饭一口饭亲手喂大的，就跟自己的亲人一样。有的工人想把它藏在钻机房里。可是，不行啊，队长下了命令！第二天，工人们只好亲自把狗送上汽车运走了！
    同志，你说我们还有什么好讲的！
    去年，我们请了几位喇嘛，选了几位代表，把敖包搬走了，搬到另外一个安静的山头。现在，我们真正开始了幸福生活，我们还要为工业化、为更幸福的未来工作。
