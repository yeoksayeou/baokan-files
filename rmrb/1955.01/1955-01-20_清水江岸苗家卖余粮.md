In mid-December last year, I visited the Miao ethnic autonomous regions of Lushan County and Taijiang County in Guizhou Province along the verdant Qingshui River. At that time, they were actively selling surplus grain to the state. Every morning, Miao people's grain-selling teams appeared on the large and small mountain roads on both sides of the Qingshui River, and then, the various grain purchasing stations became lively. During these days, one could hear the joyful songs of the Miao girls in the mountains and fields at any time.

The Miao farmers on both sides of the Qingshui River suffered from the oppression and exploitation of the Kuomintang reactionary rulers before liberation, and their lives were very poor. In the years since liberation, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, they have completed land reform and launched an agricultural production increase movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation. For example, in the Third and Fourth Districts and Kaili District of Lushan County Miao Autonomous Region, and the Second District of Taijiang County Miao Autonomous Region, many farmers have joined agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups, among which the number of mutual aid groups has developed to more than 3,300. Last year, grain production in these four districts generally increased, and the Miao farmers had more surplus grain, which they actively sold to the state. The members of more than 30 agricultural production cooperatives sold surplus grain well, quickly, and in large quantities.

Zhang Fuxiang, a Miao farmer in the Second District of Taijiang, has been transformed from a grain-short household to a surplus grain household under the continuous support of the People's Government since liberation. Last year, he sold surplus grain to the state for the first time. He told reporters: "Before liberation, I was exploited and oppressed by the Kuomintang and the landlord class, forcing me to run boats in Rongjiang for nine years, and then I ran back to my hometown to be a tenant farmer for the landlord. I worked hard every year, but I was hungry and cold every year. Thanks to the Communist Party for leading our Miao people to turn over, I also have surplus grain this year."

In the upsurge of Miao farmers selling surplus grain, the CCP branches in various townships played a core leading role. The party members of more than 50 CCP branches in the above-mentioned four districts launched extensive propaganda to the farmers at the beginning of the grain unified purchase work. When the sale of surplus grain began, each party member took the lead in selling grain. Party member Pan Huaixiu sold more than 1,100 kilograms of surplus grain to the state at one time.

    清水江岸苗家卖余粮
    新华社记者　吴振全
    去年十二月中旬，记者沿着碧绿的清水江访问了贵州省炉山县苗族自治区和台江县苗族自治区的苗族农民。那时，他们正积极地出卖余粮给国家。每天清晨，清水江两岸的大小山路上就出现了苗家的卖粮队，接着，各个粮食收购站就热闹起来。在这些日子里，随时可以听到山野间苗家姑娘的欢乐歌声。
    清水江两岸的苗族农民，解放前受尽了国民党反动统治者的压迫剥削，生活非常贫困。解放以后几年来，他们在中国共产党和人民政府领导下，完成了土地改革，开展了以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动。如炉山县苗族自治区的三区、四区、凯里区，和台江县苗族自治区的二区，许多农民都参加了农业生产合作社和互助组，其中互助组已发展到三千三百多个。去年，这四个区的粮食普遍得到增产，苗族农民的余粮增多了，他们积极地卖给国家。三十多个农业生产合作社的社员们，出卖余粮又好、又快、又多。
      台江二区苗族农民张福祥，解放后在人民政府连年扶助下，已由短粮户变成余粮户了，去年，他第一次卖余粮给国家。他对记者说：“解放前，受国民党、地主阶级剥削压迫，逼得我跑到榕江撑了九年船，以后又跑回本乡给地主当佃农，年年累死累活，年年挨饿受冻。感谢共产党领导我们苗家翻了身，我今年也有余粮了。”
    在苗族农民出卖余粮的热潮中，各乡的中共支部都起了核心领导作用。上述四个区的五十多个中共支部的党员，在粮食统购工作开始时，向农民展开了广泛的宣传。开始卖余粮时，各个党员又首先带头售粮。党员潘怀秀一次就把一千一百多斤余粮卖给国家。
