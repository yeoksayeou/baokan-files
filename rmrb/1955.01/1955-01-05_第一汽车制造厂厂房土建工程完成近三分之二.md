    The civil engineering construction of the First Automobile Works' factory buildings had reached 64.5 percent completion by the last day of 1954. The remaining 35.5 percent will be completed this year.
    In the entire factory building construction project, 1954 was the biggest and most decisive year. During this year, the workers demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity. Labor competitions were launched between various work areas, factories, and stations, and a technical innovation movement was initiated. According to incomplete statistics, from January to November 1954, the workers put forward a total of 890 rationalization proposals, solving many key production problems. The workers' technical level and labor efficiency have been greatly improved. For example, bricklayers' work completion rate increased from an average of only 64 percent of the quota in the past to 118.7 percent of the state quota. Last year, Soviet experts put forward 2,260 suggestions, which played a significant role in overfulfilling the factory building construction task.
    This year is the final year of the First Automobile Works factory building construction project. All the workers are confidently working hard to complete the factory construction task ahead of schedule.

    第一汽车制造厂厂房土建工程完成近三分之二
    第一汽车制造厂厂房土建工程，到一九五四年最后一天已完成百分之六十四点五。剩下的百分之三十五点五将在今年完成。
    在整个厂房建筑工程中，一九五四年的任务最大，是决定性的一年。这一年当中职工们发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，各工区、厂站之间开展了劳动竞赛，并掀起了技术革新运动。据不完全统计，自一九五四年一月至十一月，职工们共提出八百九十件合理化建议，解决了不少生产上的关键问题。工人技术水平和劳动效率大大提高，如瓦工由过去平均只能达到定额百分之六十四，提高到完成国家定额百分之一百一十八点七。去年苏联专家提出二千二百六十件建议，对超额完成厂房建设任务起了重大的作用。
    今年是第一汽车制造厂厂房建设工程的最后一年，全体职工正满怀信心地为提前完成建厂任务而努力。
