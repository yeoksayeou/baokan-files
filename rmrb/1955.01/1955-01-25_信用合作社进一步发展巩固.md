Further Development and Consolidation of Credit Cooperatives

　　In 1954, Shanxi Province added 3,025 credit cooperatives, exceeding the original development plan by 6 percent. By the end of December, the province already had 4,849 credit cooperatives, approximately 2.7 times the number at the end of 1953. There were about 3,570,000 members, accounting for 45 percent of the rural population eligible to join. These credit cooperatives established business relationships with 94 percent of the townships in the province. One-third of the counties in the province even achieved a state where every township had a credit cooperative.

　　While developing new cooperatives, various regions, in accordance with the Party's class line in the countryside and the operating principle that credit cooperatives should serve agricultural production, classified and rectified existing cooperatives in terms of organizational membership, democratic system, and business operations. According to incomplete statistics, more than 3,000 landlords, rich peasants, heads of reactionary secret societies, and individuals under surveillance who had infiltrated the cooperatives were purged; more than 700 cases of embezzlement, misappropriation of funds, and other illegal and undisciplined incidents were dealt with and investigated; many errors violating credit policies were corrected, and a portion of unqualified cadres were replaced; more than 500 capable backbone personnel were assigned to leadership positions. The quality of credit cooperatives in various regions has generally improved. (Li Youheng)

    信用合作社进一步发展巩固
    一九五四年，山西省增加信用合作社三千零二十五个，超过原订发展计划百分之六。到十二月底，全省已经有信用合作社四千八百四十九个，约相当于一九五三年年底的二点七倍。社员约有三百五十七万人，占农村能入社人口的百分之四十五。这些信用合作社同全省百分之九十四的乡建立了业务联系。全省有三分之一的县还达到了乡乡有信用合作社。
    在发展新社的同时，各地根据党在农村的阶级路线和信用合作社应当为农业生产服务的经营方针，对现有社从组织成员、民主制度、业务经营等方面分类进行了整顿。据不完全统计，各地清除了混入社内的地主、富农、反动会道门头子、被管制分子三千多人，处理和检查出贪污、挪用款项等违法乱纪事件七百多起；纠正了不少违反信贷政策的错误，撤换了一部分不称职的干部；配备了公道能干的五百多名骨干担任领导职务。各地信用合作社的质量普遍提高。（李有恒）
