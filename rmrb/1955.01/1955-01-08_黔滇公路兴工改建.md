The construction and reconstruction of the Guizhou-Yunnan Highway (the 481-kilometer route from Guiyang to Zhanyi, Yunnan), winding through towering mountains and steep valleys, commenced simultaneously on January 5 in the Pan County, Qinglong, and Puan construction sections. During the reactionary rule, this highway was built very simply, with many sharp turns and steep slopes along the way. The smallest radius of the curves was only seven or eight meters, the maximum slope was over 19 percent, and the roadbed and pavement were also in poor condition, with low bridge load capacities. Before the start of construction, the Guizhou Provincial Department of Transportation's Highway Bureau sent three surveying teams to conduct on-site surveys and designs and made reconstruction plans. The health, food, banking, and other departments also transferred cadres to assist in the work along the line. After the reconstruction of this line, it will meet the national standard for a sixth-class road, with a minimum curve radius of more than 27 meters and a maximum slope of no more than 9 percent. The load-bearing capacity will be increased from 15 tons to more than 50 tons. This will greatly support the construction of Yunnan and promote the exchange of materials. It is estimated that this project will be completed before the end of September this year.

    黔滇公路兴工改建
    蜿蜒在重山峻岭之间的黔滇公路（由贵阳至云南沾益间四百八十一公里的路线）已在一月五日在盘县、晴隆、普安三个施工段同时兴工改建。在反动统治时期，这条公路修建得很简陋，沿线急弯陡坡很多，弯道最小处半径只有七、八公尺，最大坡度达百分之十九以上，路基路面也很坏，桥梁载重量很低。贵州省交通厅公路局在未兴工以前，曾派出三个测量队去沿线勘察设计，并作出改建计划。卫生、粮食、银行等部门也抽调干部前往沿线协助工作。这条线路改建后，要达到国家规定的六等路标准，弯道最小半径要达二十七公尺以上，最大坡度不得超过百分之九。载重能力要从十五公吨提高到五十公吨以上。这对支援云南建设，促进物资交流都有很大作用。预计这一工程可在今年九月底以前竣工。
