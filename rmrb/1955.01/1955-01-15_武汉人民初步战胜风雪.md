    Wuhan People Initially Triumph Over Wind and Snow
    Around the New Year of 1955, Wuhan experienced about ten consecutive days of heavy snowfall. On January 5th, the temperature plummeted to -14.6 degrees Celsius, an unprecedented cold since meteorological records began in 1886.

    The Party and government leadership of Wuhan City promptly took measures to address the difficulties brought to the people of Wuhan by this severe cold and snow. During the New Year period, cadres from city and district government agencies, street and township offices, and public security stations braved the wind and snow, going deep into streets, alleys, and villages to understand the people's living difficulties. They swiftly distributed large amounts of relief funds, cotton clothing, and cotton quilts to those in need. By the afternoon of the 4th, over 2.002 billion yuan in emergency relief funds, 5,337 pieces of cotton clothing, and 1,070 cotton quilts had been distributed. Dangerous houses covered by ice and snow have also been shored up and reinforced. State-owned stores and cooperatives, under difficult conditions, also ensured the supply of daily necessities such as grain, oil, salt, coal briquettes, and vegetables. To ensure the safety of people living on the water and transportation, shipping workers from units such as the Hubei Provincial Shipping Administration drove tugboats to fight ice on the Han River and towed distressed civilian boats to safe berths in the Yangtze River. Traffic on the Han River has now been restored. In the suburbs, cattle were moved to shelters to protect them from the wind and snow, avoiding deaths that would affect spring plowing.

    On January 5th, the weather turned sunny, but the solid ice has not melted, and the severe cold will continue. The people of Wuhan, under the leadership of the Party and government, are continuing to fight against the severe cold and wind and snow.

    武汉人民初步战胜风雪
    一九五五年新年前后，武汉市连续落了十天左右的大雪，一月五日气温降到摄氏零下十四度六，这是当地一八八六年有气象纪录以来从未有过的严寒。
    武汉市党、政领导机关及时地采取了措施，解决这次严寒风雪给武汉人民带来的困难。新年期间，市、区政府机关和街、乡、公安派出所的干部，冒着风雪，深入街道里巷和乡村了解人民生活的困难情况，把大批救济金、棉衣、棉被等迅速发到了需要救济的人的手上；到四日下午止，已发出紧急救济金二十亿零二千余万元、棉衣五千三百三十七件、棉被一千零七十床；被冰雪覆压的危险房屋，也已打撑加固。国营商店和合作社在困难条件下，也保证了粮食、油盐、煤球、蔬菜等生活必需品的供应。为了保障水上人民的安全和交通运输，湖北省航运管理局等单位航运工人驾驶着的轮驳，在汉水上展开了破冰斗争，并把脱险的民船拖到长江中的安全地带停舶。现在汉水的交通已经恢复。在郊区，耕牛转移到了可蔽风雪的房屋内，避免死亡影响春耕。
      一月五日天气转晴，但坚冰未融，严寒仍将持续。武汉人民，正在党和政府的领导下，继续同严寒和风雪搏斗。
