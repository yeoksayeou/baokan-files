    In the ethnic mixed areas of Yunnan Province, people of all ethnic groups continue to establish agricultural production cooperatives. The number has now increased from more than 750 established in the autumn of last year to more than 1,200. Among them, 346 are newly established agricultural cooperatives jointly run by two or more ethnic groups. Agricultural production cooperatives established by ethnic minorities account for about one-quarter of the total number of agricultural production cooperatives in the province.

    The newly established agricultural production cooperatives are now actively carrying out winter agricultural production. Some agricultural production cooperatives in mountainous or semi-mountainous areas are also engaged in the production of local and special products. (Xinhua News Agency)

    云南民族杂居区
    继续建立农业生产合作社
    云南省内地民族杂居区各族人民继续建立农业生产合作社，现在，已由去年秋季建立的七百五十多个发展到一千二百多个。其中，新建的两种以上民族合办的农业社有三百四十六个。少数民族人民建立的农业生产合作社，约占全省农业生产合作社总数的四分之一。
    新建立的农业生产合作社，目前正积极开展冬季农业生产，有些山区或半山区的农业生产合作社还进行土产特产的生产。　（新华社）
