Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, January 21st: According to TASS, Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, delivered a speech at the Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council on the 19th, when he presented an appeal to the people of the world against the preparation for atomic war.

He said: "The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council has decided to launch a widespread signature campaign to express the protest of the people of the world against the preparation for atomic war. Based on the document you entrusted me to draft, this movement should begin and be carried out immediately."

Recalling the opposition encountered since the advent of the atomic bomb, he said that scientists from various countries have been working to remind public opinion of the dangers posed by this weapon. In 1950, in Stockholm, we called for a massive movement to ban atomic weapons and establish strict international supervision, which is one of the great achievements of our peace movement. There is no doubt that the Stockholm Appeal played a huge role, and those governments that wanted to build their foreign policy on the use of atomic weapons had to consider public opinion. This explains why they have been trying to cover up their actions with deceptive means when planning and preparing for atomic war. The decision adopted by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council last December is one such means. We must call on the people to rise up against those who are plotting atomic war in this way.

He said that we should not wait until this devastating war breaks out before condemning those who launched it. We must now strike back at those who are preparing for this war. We must demand that all countries destroy stockpiled atomic weapons and immediately cease the production of atomic weapons.

Joliot-Curie called on the millions of men and women, inspired by the desire for life and the love of their relatives, to go door-to-door and to workshops and fields to collect signatures, thus placing a tremendous obstacle on the road to atomic war.

    在世界和平理事会常委会扩大会议上
    世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里的发言
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社维也纳讯：世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里十九日在世界和平理事会常务委员会扩大会议上提出反对准备原子战争的告全世界人民书时发言。
    他说：“世界和平理事会常务委员会已经决定广泛地发动一个签名运动，以便表达全世界人民对准备原子战争的抗议。在你们委托我草拟的文件的基础上，这个运动应立即开始和开展起来。”
    他在回顾自从原子弹出现以来所遭到的反对时说，各国科学家都曾经努力提醒舆论反对这种武器所带来的危险。一九五○年，我们在斯德哥尔摩号召发动一个争取禁止原子武器和建立严格的国际监督的巨大运动，这是我们和平运动的巨大功绩之一。毫无疑问，斯德哥尔摩宣言起了巨大的作用，那些想把对外政策建筑在使用原子武器的基础上的政府不得不考虑舆论的意见。这就说明为什么它们在策划和准备原子战争的时候，竭力用骗人的手段来掩饰它们的行动。北大西洋集团理事会去年十二月通过的决定就是用这样一种手段的。我们要号召人民起来反对正在用这种手段策划原子战争的人。
    他说，我们不应该等到这种毁灭性的战争爆发之后，再来谴责发动这种战争。我们必须在现在就反击准备这种战争的人。我们必须要求所有的国家销毁储存的原子武器，立即停止生产原子武器。
    约里奥—居里号召为生命的愿望和热爱亲人的心情所鼓舞的千千万万的男女挨门挨户并到车间和田地去征集签名，这样来在走向原子战争的道路上放下一个极其巨大的障碍。
