In Pyongyang

Korea, Yu Zhonglu

It was a day a month after the armistice. It was raining, and I met five Chinese People's Volunteer Army comrades in front of the "Eulmil Pavilion" on Moran Hill.

These Chinese comrades, who had just come from the front lines, asked me where "Choesungdae" and "Pubyok Pavilion" were. However, they saw nothing where I pointed. "Choesungdae" seemed to be in the distant mist; "Pubyok Pavilion" had been reduced to rubble by the beastly American imperialists.

They stood silently, their faces and eyes radiating hatred and anger towards the atrocities of American imperialism.

The American imperialist beasts had almost turned our democratic capital into ruins, completely destroying the beautiful scenery of Moran Hill, which the Korean people had been proud of since ancient times. They snatched the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of cultural relics.

However, the American imperialist beasts ultimately failed to subdue the patriotic and heroic Korean people, nor did they in any way frustrate the strong will of the people of Pyongyang.

As soon as the news of the armistice spread, the citizens, regardless of gender or age, immediately ran out from underground, carrying shovels and picks, and rushed to the streets and squares. The People's Army and Volunteer Army warriors replaced the weapons of destroying the enemy with construction tools; students and cadres also temporarily put down their books and pens and began a new battle.

"Build Pyongyang more beautiful and magnificent than before!"

According to the magnificent and grand design blueprint, streets, squares, and tall buildings began to be restored and built.

Students from various universities such as the Central Party School of the Korean Workers' Party, the University of Construction, and the University of Music, undertook the construction of the 60-meter-wide and 2.4-kilometer-long "Stalin Avenue" and the 36,000-square-meter "Kim Il-sung Square"; students from Kim Il-sung University built the "Moran Hill Stadium" which can accommodate more than 40,000 spectators. Several People's Army units built the 40-meter-wide and 2.1-kilometer-long "People's Army Road" and the 3.3-kilometer-long ring road from Pyongyang Station via "Potong Gate" to "Taedong Gate."

Volunteer Army warriors undertook the restoration of the Taedong River Iron Bridge and other major construction projects.

Hundreds of thousands of citizens participated in the construction of "Stalin Avenue," "Kim Il-sung Square," and "Mao Zedong Square." They worked day and night, their burning sweat seeping deep into the soil. They laid pebbles one by one and planted cypresses and lilacs one by one. It is not difficult to imagine that in the near future, their innocent children will happily swing on these fragrant trees....

In this way, the work of building streets was completed fifteen days ahead of the ninth anniversary of "August 15th". "Kim Il-sung Square," which was originally scheduled to be completed from 1954 to 1955, was also completed at this time. Underground, the streets were equipped with sewage pipes and cables, the main roads were paved with cement, and the sidewalks were paved with bricks. The center of the street was covered with green grass, with trees on both sides and thousands of street lights arranged.

A total of 295,400 cubic meters of soil were excavated from the streets and squares, and 300,000 cubic meters of cement were used here. The cement paved on the streets covered a total area of 102,000 square meters, and more than 525,000 bricks were used.

While repairing the old buildings, new buildings were also being built. Four- and five-story buildings, which were rarely seen before the war, also began to rise.

By the ninth anniversary of "August 15th", workers, People's Army warriors, and students from Kim Il-sung University and Kim Chaek University of Technology had basically completed the walls of the new two- to six-story "Cabinet Affairs Bureau Office Building," "Workers' Apartments," and "International Hotel" and other buildings. Volunteer Army warriors were also rapidly building the "Cabinet Joint Building," the "Revolutionary Martyrs' Children's Academy," and the West Pyongyang Locomotive Depot, etc.

Citizens particularly enthusiastically participated in the restoration of schools. Before the ninth anniversary of "August 15th", they had restored more than 20 People's Schools (primary schools) and junior and senior high school buildings, and built six new schools including Pyongyang No. 1 High School and No. 1 Girls' High School. In addition, many halls and cultural and educational facilities, as well as tens of thousands of houses, have also been restored and newly built.

Citizens have moved from earth kilns to new homes and are living a new life; children are studying freely and happily in the new four- and five-story school buildings; some factories that moved to the suburbs of Pyongyang and newly restored factories have also begun production.

These large-scale peaceful constructions demonstrate the infinite strength of the Korean people and their wisdom and talent. The newly built "Moran Hill Theater" and "Workers' Apartments" are good examples. The "Moran Hill Theater," known for its elegance and beauty, was built to harmonize with the natural beauty of Moran Hill. It is a modern building with the traditional architectural style of the Korean nation and an excellent artistic work of the Korean people. Also, Korean workers have begun to live in magnificent residences like palaces that they have never lived in before.

In the process of repairing and building Pyongyang, the achievements jointly made by the Korean people and the fraternal Chinese people are brilliant.

Among the People's Army warriors who displayed creativity on the front line of restoration and construction, many were combat heroes, and they have established new meritorious services - meritorious services of labor. For example, Comrade Shin Chun-kyun, a combat hero in the Kang Ryang-hwan squad that built "People's Army Road," completed 600% of the new standard workload in the earth excavation work. Other heroes also completed several hundred percent, setting a model role.

In the work of building "Stalin Avenue," Xu Hongchun, a student at the Central Party School, created the "stage-style excavation and transportation method," exceeding the original plan by six times. In the work of building the "Moran Hill Stadium," Kim Il-sung University student Kang Seon-jong, together with nine classmates, organized a "blasting team" and completed the blasting work of 400 people before the deadline. In addition, female student Jeong Myeong-wol also signed a competition condition with Kang Seon-jong, concentrating their efforts and working hard, and as a result, won the "Victory Flag," which demonstrated the heroic spirit of Korean women in the work of restoring and building the capital.

In the work of repairing and building the heroic city of Pyongyang, the contributions made by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army warriors are deeply appreciated by us. The Volunteer Army warriors who built the "Revolutionary Martyrs' Children's Academy" strictly abide by the operating standards and technical specifications, and insist on the solidity of the project. The comrades who were in charge of bricklaying, when laying bricks with cement, would stop after laying a few and wait for the cement to solidify slightly before laying again, so as to avoid cement overflowing and affecting the quality. They said: "We want to build the school building for the children of the Korean revolutionary martyrs into a solid school building that will not be damaged for hundreds of years." They are working with this noble sentiment!

The slogans and actions of the comrades who built the "United Building" also greatly encouraged our courage and deepened our friendship. They said: "Pyongyang and Beijing are symbols of our common ideals. We want to build Pyongyang as beautiful as Beijing!" They dedicated all their creative power. How noble is their internationalist thought! This is another demonstration of the steel-like unity between us after the end of the war!

For this reason, the people of Pyongyang, like all the Korean people, will forever sing the praises of the noble moral qualities of the people of the Mao Zedong era cultivated and educated by the great Chinese Communist Party and their blood and sweat assistance!

In this way, under the joint efforts of the people of Korea and China, Pyongyang is rapidly being restored and rebuilt. The huge construction project, which would take decades to complete in capitalist countries, has almost completed the foundation part in less than a year, and large buildings are being built rapidly.

The Chinese comrades I met at "Eulmil Pavilion", if they come to Pyongyang again, they will definitely watch Pyongyang carefully with surprised and excited eyes!

Along "Stalin Avenue," red and white buildings stand on the left and right sides, rows of cars are running on the avenue, energetic people are coming and going, and children are singing....

Crossing the clear waves of the Taedong River, East Pyongyang stretches straight into new streets; looking back, "Mao Zedong Square" shines in the sunset, surrounded by beautiful residential areas, and wisps of purple smoke fly into the sky with the wind....

Moran Hill and the restored ancient city gates in the city, as well as pavilions and towers....

Pyongyang, Pyongyang, which was destroyed into ruins by the war, has miraculously changed its appearance and is becoming a more beautiful, magnificent and grand city!

More than 600,000 citizens have already lived in new houses, and children are happily singing songs on their way home from school.

"………
Bright stars are shining in the sky,
Bright lights are shining on the street;
The stars in the sky have not increased,
But there are more lights on the street...."

Yes, the city of Pyongyang, which never sleeps, is increasing its lights every night. The streets that have been sleeping in the dark for three years have now become as bright as the hearts of the Korean people. The new streets are constantly filled with magnificent songs of construction, and people's moods are so boiling in the New Year!

After the completion of the Three-Year Plan for the People's Economy, when entering the Five-Year Plan, the population of Pyongyang will be counted in millions; this city, which has been stained with the blood of the people and built with the sweat of the people, will forever remember its past encounters and stand more firmly.

    在平壤
    朝鲜  俞忠禄
    是停战一个月后的某日，天正下着雨，我在牡丹峰“乙密台”前遇到五位中国人民志愿军同志。
    这些刚从前线来的中国同志，问我“最胜台”和“浮碧楼”在什么地方。可是，我所指的地方，他们却什么也没看到。“最胜台”像是在遥远的云雾中；“浮碧楼”则被野兽般的美帝国主义炸得只剩下了一点瓦砾了。
    他们默默地站着，脸上，眼睛里，喷射出对美帝国主义的暴行的憎恨和愤怒。
    美帝国主义野兽，几乎把我们的民主首都变为废墟，完全破坏了朝鲜人民自古以来就引为骄傲的牡丹峰的秀丽景色。它们抢去了成千上万的人的生命，破坏了千万座建筑和几千件文物。
    但是，美帝国主义野兽，毕竟没能使具有爱国主义和英雄主义精神的朝鲜人民屈服，也没能丝毫挫折平壤市人民坚强的意志。
    停战消息一经传出，市民们，不分男女老少，都立即从地下跑出来，肩着锹镐，跑向街道和广场。人民军和志愿军勇士们，把消灭敌人的武器换上建筑用具；学生和干部们也暂时放下书本和笔，开始了新的战斗。
      “把平壤建设得比从前更美丽，更雄壮！”
    根据雄伟宏大的设计蓝图，街道、广场和高大的建筑物开始恢复和修建起来。
    朝鲜劳动党中央党校、建设大学、音乐大学等各个大学的学生们，包修了宽六十公尺、长二点四公里的“斯大林大路”和三万六千平方公尺的“金日成广场”；金日成综合大学的学生们则修建能容纳四万多名观众的“牡丹峰运动场”。几支人民军部队建筑着宽四十公尺、长二点一公里的“人民军路”和从平壤车站经“普通门”到“大同门”的长三点三公里的环行路。
    志愿军勇士们承担了修复大同江铁桥和其它各大建筑工程。
    几十万市民参加了建设“斯大林大路”、“金日成广场”和“毛泽东广场”的工作。他们不分昼夜地工作着，灼热的汗滴渗入泥土深处。他们铺着一粒粒的石子，栽着一棵棵的柏树和紫丁香。人们不难想到，在不久的将来，在这些芬芳的树上，他们的天真的孩子们，将会快乐地荡着秋千……。
    就这样，修建街道的工作，在“八·一五”九周年纪念日之前，就提前十五天完成了。原定在一九五四年到一九五五年才能完成的“金日成广场”，也在这时候完成了。街道底下装设了上下水道管和电缆，大路是由水泥铺垫的，人行道上则铺着砖块。街道中心铺着绿草，两旁是树木，并且排列着几千盏路灯。
    从街道和广场挖出的土有二十九万五千四百立方公尺，用在这里的水泥有三十万立方公尺。铺在街道上的水泥，面积共有十万二千平方公尺，并且用去砖头五十二万五千多块。
    人们一面修复着旧的建筑，一面还兴建着新的建筑。在战争以前几乎见不到的四、五层的大楼房也开始耸立起来了。
    到“八·一五”九周年纪念日为止，工人、人民军勇士、金日成综合大学和金策工业大学的学生们，基本上完成了两层到六层的新“内阁事务局办公大楼”、“工人公寓”和“国际饭店”等建筑的墙壁。志愿军勇士们也飞快地建筑着“内阁联合大楼”和“革命烈士子女学院”以及西平壤机务段等。
    市民们特别踊跃地参加修复学校的工作。他们在“八·一五”九周年纪念日之前就修复了二十多所人民学校（小学）和初中、高中的校舍，新建了平壤第一高中和第一女中等六所学校。此外，并有许多厅舍和文化教育设施以及几万座住宅也修复和新建起来了。
    市民们已从土窖搬到新宅里，并过着新的生活；孩子们在四、五层的新校舍里自由、愉快地学习着；搬到平壤市郊去的一些工厂和新修复的工厂也都开始生产了。
    这些大规模的和平建设，显示了朝鲜人民无穷无尽的力量和他们的智慧和才干。新建的“牡丹峰剧场”和“工人公寓”，就是很好的例子。以清雅、秀丽著称的“牡丹峰剧场”，是为和谐牡丹峰的自然美而建起来的，它是具有朝鲜民族传统的建筑风格的现代化大建筑，是朝鲜人民的优异的艺术作品。还有，朝鲜工人们也开始住在从未住过的宫阙似的华美的住宅中。
    在修复和建设平壤的过程中，朝鲜人民和兄弟的中国人民共同取得的业绩是光辉灿烂的。
    在修复和建设的战线上发挥了创造性的人民军勇士们当中，有许多是战斗英雄，他们又建立了新的功勋——劳动的功勋。例如修建“人民军路”的康良焕分队中的战斗英雄申天均同志，在挖土工作中完成了新标准工作量的百分之六百。其它英雄们也都是完成了百分之几百，起了模范作用。
    在修筑“斯大林大路”的工作中，中央党校学生许洪淳创造了“阶段式掘凿和运送方法”，超额完成了原定计划的六倍。在修建“牡丹峰运动场”工作中，金日成大学学生姜善宗同九位同学一起，组织了“爆破组”，在限期前完成了四百人的爆破工作。此外，女同学郑明月，也和姜善宗订立了竞赛条件，集中力量，努力工作，结果荣获了“胜利旗”，这显示了朝鲜妇女在修复和建设首都的工作中的英雄气概。
    在修复和建设英雄的城市——平壤的工作中，中国人民志愿军勇士们建立的功勋，是我们所深深感激的。修建“革命烈士子女学院”的志愿军勇士们，严格遵守操作标准和技术规格，坚持工程的牢固。担任砌墙的同志们，在砌砖用水泥时，砌一些就停一下，等水泥稍为凝固之后再砌，以免水泥溢出，影响质量。他们说：“我们要把朝鲜革命烈士子女的校舍建成几百年也不坏的牢固的校舍。”他们就是怀着这种高贵的心情来进行工作！
    建筑“联合大楼”的同志们的口号和行动，也大大鼓舞了我们的勇气，和加深了我们的友谊。他们说：“平壤和北京，是我们共同的理想的象征。我们要把平壤建设得和北京一样美好！”他们献出了一切创造的力量。他们这种国际主义思想多么高贵！这是我们之间钢铁般的团结在战争结束以后的又一次示威！
    正因为如此，平壤市人民，同全体朝鲜人民一样，对于伟大的中国共产党所培养和教育出来的毛泽东时代的人们的高贵的道德品质和他们的血汗的援助，要永远歌颂下去！
    就这样，平壤市在朝中两国人民的共同努力下，迅速地修复并重建着。在资本主义国家需要几十年才能完成的巨大的修建工程，我们不到一年，就几乎完成了基础部分，并飞速地继续建筑着大型建筑物。
    我在“乙密台”见到的几位中国同志，如果再来到平壤，他们一定会以惊奇的，也是兴奋的眼光仔细观看平壤！
    顺着“斯大林大路”，左右两侧矗立着红、白色的大楼，大路上奔驰着汽车的行列，充满活力的人们熙来攘往，孩子们唱着歌……。
    越过大同江的碧波，东平壤笔挺地伸延着新的街道；回过头来，“毛泽东广场”在夕阳中放着光彩，那周围是美丽的住宅区，紫色的炊烟缕缕随风飞入天际……。
    牡丹峰和市内各处修复的古城门，还有楼台殿阁……。
    平壤，被战争破坏成废墟的平壤，已经奇迹般地改变了面貌，正在变成更美丽、雄壮、宏伟的大城市！
    六十多万市民已经住在新屋子里，孩子们在放学回家的路上，高兴地唱着歌。
      “………
    天空中闪烁着亮晶晶的星，
    街道上闪烁着亮晶晶的灯；
    天上的星星没增加，
    街上的灯火又多啦……。”
    是的，不夜之城平壤，每天夜晚都在增加着灯火。在黑暗中沉睡了三年的街道，现在同朝鲜人民的心一样，变得雪亮雪亮的了。新生的街道上不断传出雄壮的建设的歌声，人们的心情，在新年，是多么沸腾啊！
    在人民经济三年计划完成以后，进入五年计划的时候，平壤的人口将要以百万来计算；曾染遍人民的鲜血和人民流汗建设起来的这座城市，将永远记住自己昨天的遭遇而更加坚强地矗立着。
