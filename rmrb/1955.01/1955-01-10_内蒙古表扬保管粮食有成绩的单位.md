The Grain Department and the People's Supervisory Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government issued a circular commending grain warehouses and keepers who have made remarkable achievements in grain storage work.

    The staff of the Chengguan Grain Depot of the Chahar Right Wing Middle Banner Grain Bureau actively studied the grain storage experience of Yuhang County, Zhejiang Province, and had no accidents in the past year. In late June of last year, a flash flood breached a hole in the city wall, less than 200 meters from the grain depot. The staff, disregarding personal safety, jumped into the water to block the hole, which not only ensured the safety of the stored grain but also the lives and property of nearby residents. The Chengguan Grain Depots of the Siziwang Banner Grain Bureau and the Baotou County Grain Depot paid close attention to the cleanliness and hygiene of the granaries. In April, the staff of the Baotou County Grain Depot fought against a blizzard for three days and nights, preventing large quantities of grain from being damaged. The staff of the Xiguiqi No. 70 Kilometer Grain Depot of the Hulunbuir League developed six types of all-round ventilation stacks, which generally reduced the moisture content of the grain to a safe standard. Han Wenchang, a grain keeper at the Baotou City Grain General Depot, was conscientious and responsible in his work. No spoilage of grain occurred in the warehouse under his management for nineteen months. These units and keepers have been commended.
    Grain bureaus in various parts of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are also selecting model units and model personnel in grain storage work. (Report from our Inner Mongolia reporter station)

    内蒙古表扬保管粮食有成绩的单位
    内蒙古自治区人民政府粮食部和人民监察委员会发出通报，表扬在粮食保管工作中取得显著成绩的粮食仓库和保管员。
    察哈尔右翼中旗粮食局城关粮库的职工们，积极学习浙江省余杭县保管粮食的经验，一年来没有发生事故；去年六月下旬，山洪冲开城墙洞口，离粮库不到二百公尺，职工们不顾生命危险跳入水中抢堵洞口，不仅保证了存粮的安全，还保证了附近居民生命财产的安全。萨拉齐县粮食局城关各库和宝昌县粮库切实注意了粮仓清洁卫生工作；宝昌县粮库的职工四月间还向暴风雪进行了三昼夜的斗争，使大批粮食避免遭受损失。呼伦贝尔盟喜桂图旗七○公里粮库的职工，研究出六种四面八方通风垛，将粮食水份普遍降低到安全标准。包头市粮食总库保管员韩文昌工作中认真负责，他负责管理的仓库十九个月内没有发生坏粮事故。这些单位和保管员都受到了表扬。
    内蒙古自治区各地粮食局也在评选粮食保管工作中的模范单位和模范人员。  （本报内蒙古记者站）
