Anshan Iron and Steel Industrial Furnace Construction Engineering Company, Refractory Construction Site, Chimney Construction Site workers, under the guidance of Soviet expert Budanierk, adopted the Soviet method of mechanized internal scaffolding and frozen bricklaying for chimney construction in winter, and achieved success. The first 40-meter-high chimney built using this method was completed on December 31st last year, taking only one month. According to Niu Yunsheng, foreman of the chimney section with more than 20 years of experience, and Li Bingzhi, head of the Engineering Technology Section of the Furnace Construction Engineering Company, it is the first time this method has been used in China. In the past, chimney construction used external scaffolding, which not only prevented construction in winter, but also prevented work at night and in rainy weather. The progress of construction was also slow. It would take at least two months to build the same 40-meter-high chimney. The mechanized internal scaffolding winter frozen bricklaying method overcomes the above-mentioned shortcomings. Workers lay bricks inside the chimney, with a cover plate like a flat ground under their feet, and a movable warm shed on top, making the work very safe.

Now, the Furnace Construction Engineering Company is summarizing the experience of this advanced method and preparing to promote it to all chimney construction projects. (Our Liaoning reporter station)

    鞍钢学习苏联经验在冬季砌筑烟筒
    鞍钢工业筑炉工程公司耐火工地烟筒工地职工，在苏联专家布丹涅克指导下，采用苏联的冬季机械化内脚手冻结砌砖法砌烟筒，获得了成功。用这个方法砌筑的第一座四十公尺高的烟筒，只用了一个月的时间，已在去年十二月三十一日完工了。据二十多年工龄的老工人、烟筒工段工长牛云生和筑炉工程公司工程技术科长李炳智谈，采用这种方法在我国还是第一次。过去，砌筑烟筒都是用外脚手，不但不能在冬季施工，而且在夜里和风雨天也不能工作。砌筑的进度又慢，砌筑同样一座四十公尺高的烟筒，至少得两个月。用机械化内脚手冬季冻结砌砖法，克服了上述的各种缺点，工人在烟筒里砌砖，脚下有像平地一样的盖板，顶上有活动的暖棚，工作起来很安全。
    现在，筑炉工程公司正在总结这一先进方法的经验，准备推广到所有砌筑烟筒的工程上去。    （本报辽宁记者站）
