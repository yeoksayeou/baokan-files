    The American Aggressor Clique Feels Uneasy About the Decision to Convene the Asian-African Conference
   [Xinhua News Agency, January 4th] It can be seen from Western news agency reports that Washington is uneasy about the joint communiqué issued by the Prime Ministers of the five South Asian countries in Bogor regarding the convening of the Asian-African Conference.

    The Associated Press reported on December 31st that American officials in Washington "did not like the arrangement of the guest list (for the Asian-African Conference)". The news said that although American officials had "not openly expressed their doubts about the value of this Asian-African Conference," they privately expressed dissatisfaction with the Bogor meeting's communiqué. The news quoted foreign observers in Washington as saying that the real reason the United States was picking on the Asian-African Conference was that the US government feared that a large part of the world's population "might be willing to abandon the path planned by Washington." They believe that "a certain anxiety" can be seen from Dulles' attitude, who is worried that the Asian-African Conference may hinder his conspiracy to win over Asian and African countries to participate in the Manila aggressive bloc and the Middle East aggressive bloc. At a press conference held on December 31st, Dulles said that the purpose of convening the Asian-African Conference was "unclear" to him.

    Reuters correspondent Ross Mark in Washington reported on December 30th that Washington was concerned about the joint communiqué's mention that one of the purposes of the Asian-African Conference was to "discuss issues of particular interest to the peoples of Asian and African countries, such as issues related to national sovereignty, racism and colonialism."

### 对召开亚非会议的决定  美国侵略集团感到不安

    对召开亚非会议的决定
    美国侵略集团感到不安
   【新华社四日讯】从西方通讯社的报道中可以看出：华盛顿方面对于南亚五国总理在茂物发表的关于召开亚非会议的联合公报感到不安。
    合众社在去年十二月三十一日报道，华盛顿的美国官员“不喜欢（亚非会议的）这张客人名单的安排”。消息说，美国官员虽然一直“没有公开表示他们对这个亚非会议的价值所抱的怀疑”，但是他们却在私下对茂物会议的公报表示不满。这个消息援引华盛顿的外国观察家的话说，美国之所以挑剔亚非会议，真正原因是美国政府担心世界人口中的一大部分“可能愿意撇开华盛顿所规划的途径”。他们认为，从杜勒斯的态度中可以看出“某种忧虑”，他担心的是亚非会议可能阻碍他拉拢亚非国家参加马尼拉侵略集团和中东侵略集团的阴谋。杜勒斯在去年十二月三十一日举行的记者招待会上说，召开亚非会议的目的对他说来“不明确”。
    路透社驻华盛顿记者罗斯·马克在去年十二月三十日报道，华盛顿方面对于联合公报提到亚非会议的目的之一是“讨论对亚非国家人民具有特别利害关系的问题，例如有关民族主权的问题和种族主义及殖民主义的问题”表示忧虑。
