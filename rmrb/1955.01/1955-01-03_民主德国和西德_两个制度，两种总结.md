Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 29 (TASS): East Germany and West Germany made two different summaries as they welcomed 1955.

In 1954, the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) flourished. All work was aimed at further consolidating the democratic system economically and politically, improving the living conditions of the working people, striving for peace, and peacefully resolving the German question in the interests of all German people.

According to official materials, the 1954 national economic plan of the German Democratic Republic is about to be successfully completed. Total output increased by approximately 10% compared to 1953. For example, in the third quarter of this year, pig iron production increased by 25% compared to the third quarter of 1953, steel increased by 28%, various agricultural machines increased by 45%, food industry equipment increased by 102%, and textile and light industry equipment increased by 42%. Along with the development of heavy industry, light industry in the German Democratic Republic also achieved smooth development in 1954. The consumer goods produced by industry and handicrafts in the German Democratic Republic this year are approximately 20% more than last year.

New achievements have also been made in various sectors of agriculture. Although the climate was unfavorable this year, the harvest of many crops still increased significantly compared to last year. For example, the potato harvest increased by 11%, and the sugar beet harvest increased by 21%. The total number of tractors and agricultural machines has greatly increased. In 1954, the agricultural production cooperatives of the German Democratic Republic made new achievements in organizational and operational consolidation. Currently, there are 5,108 cooperatives in the German Democratic Republic, cultivating 920,768 hectares of farmland.

In 1954, the turnover of domestic and foreign trade in the German Democratic Republic continued to increase. The German Democratic Republic has established solid economic ties with countries of the peaceful democratic camp. The German Democratic Republic also conducts frequent trade with 47 capitalist countries, and the total trade volume with these countries has increased by 21.6% compared to last year. The total volume of trade within Germany has increased significantly. New achievements have also been made in improving the material situation of residents of the German Democratic Republic in 1954. The real wages of the working people have increased significantly, and the income of farmers has also increased.

The government of the German Democratic Republic implemented price reductions for grain and daily necessities in September 1954, thereby saving residents 600 million marks. Due to the increase in the real wages of the working people of the German Democratic Republic and the continuous reduction of prices, people's needs are growing year by year.

The German Democratic Republic is also welcoming the new year—1955—with remarkable achievements in cultural construction. 1954 was a year of further development of the education and healthcare systems, and a year of increasing primary and secondary schools, universities, clubs, cultural palaces, sanatoriums, rest homes, and other cultural and welfare facilities. New achievements have also been made in the development of science and art in 1954.

Based on the various achievements already obtained, the residents of the German Democratic Republic bravely welcome 1955, the final year of the first five-year plan, a year that opens up new and brilliant prospects for the working people of the German Democratic Republic.

In the past year, however, the situation in West Germany was completely different. There, the old militarist forces once again occupied a dominant position. In 1954, the Bonn ruling group openly adopted the policy of rearming West Germany, making West Germany participate in military blocs, and preparing for new wars. Now West Germany is making every effort to prepare for the establishment of a new national defense force and massively produce weapons. The characteristic of West Germany's economic development in 1954 is that all industrial sectors directly or indirectly serving rearmament have expanded production. At the same time, many peaceful industrial sectors have experienced stagnation.

In the middle of 1954, the Bonn judicial authorities banned the progressive organization of West German youth—the Free German Youth League—and fabricated many illegal trials against fighters for peace and German unification.

At the end of 1954, the West German authorities began an illegal trial against the Communist Party in order to "ban" the Communist Party. The recently passed 1955-1956 West German budget proves that the Bonn ruling group is implementing a policy of preparing for war. Of the total budget expenditure of 27 billion marks, 9 billion marks are allocated for military expenditures. However, even this figure is far from realistic. West German newspapers, including bourgeois newspapers, citing estimates by authoritative military figures, said that recent expenditures on arming West Germany have reached tens of billions of marks.

The result of the intensified armament policy is a continuous decline in the living standards of the working people. The wages of West German workers have basically remained at the original level, and have even decreased in some industrial sectors, while the prices of daily necessities have continued to rise. According to recent reports in West German newspapers, bread prices in North Rhine-Westphalia have increased by 6% to 8% since November 10 this year. In Hamburg, butter, sausages, eggs, rice, cheese, fruits, and vegetables increased significantly in price in October. The Bremen Statistical Office recently announced that the price of vegetables in October this year was double that of October 1953. Meat, fish, butter, eggs, and daily necessities are all significantly more expensive. According to the German News Agency, in many cities in Bavaria, the price of bread and other foods has increased by an average of 10% in recent times.

### 民主德国和西德—两个制度，两种总结

    民主德国和西德—两个制度，两种总结
   【新华社讯】塔斯社柏林二十九日电：德意志民主共和国和西德在迎接一九五五年时作出了两种不同的总结。
    一九五四年，德意志民主共和国蓬勃发展，一切工作都是为了在经济上和政治上进一步巩固民主制度和改善劳动人民的生活条件，为了争取和平和争取按照全体德国人民的利益和平解决德国问题。
    根据官方的材料，德意志民主共和国一九五四年国民经济计划将要胜利地完成。和一九五三年相比，总产量约增加百分之十。例如，今年第三季度生铁产量比一九五三年第三季度增加了百分之二十五，钢材增加了百分之二十八，各种农业机器增加了百分之四十五，食品工业的装备增加了百分之一百零二，纺织工业和轻工业的装备增加了百分之四十二。和重工业发展的同时，一九五四年轻工业也获得顺利的发展。德意志民主共和国工业和手工业今年出产的消费品约比去年多百分之二十。
    在农业的各个部门也获得了新的成就。虽然今年气候不良，许多作物的收获量仍然比去年增加很多。例如，马铃薯的收获量增加了百分之十一，甜菜的收获量增加了百分之二十一。拖拉机和农业机器的总数大大增加了。一九五四年，德意志民主共和国的农业生产合作社在组织上和经营上的巩固的工作取得了新的成就。目前，德意志民主共和国共有五千一百零八个合作社，这些合作社耕种了九十二万零七百六十八公顷农田。
    一九五四年德意志民主共和国国内贸易和对外贸易流转额继续增加。德意志民主共和国同和平民主阵营各国建立了巩固的经济联系。德意志民主共和国也同四十七个资本主义国家进行频繁的贸易，和这些国家的贸易总额同去年相比增加了百分之二十一点六。德国内部的贸易总额大大增加了。一九五四年在改善德意志民主共和国居民物质情况方面也有了新的成就。劳动人民的实际工资显著地增加了，农民的收入也提高了。
    德意志民主共和国政府在一九五四年九月实行了对粮食和日用品的减价，因此使居民节省了六亿马克。由于德意志民主共和国劳动人民实际工资的增加和物价不断地降低，人民的需要一年一年地在增长。
    德意志民主共和国在文化建设方面也以显著的成就来迎接新的一年——一九五五年。一九五四年是教育制度和保健制度进一步发展的一年，是中小学校、高等学校、俱乐部、文化宫、疗养院、休养所和其他文化福利设施增加的一年。一九五四年在发展科学和艺术方面也取得了新的成就。
    德意志民主共和国居民依据着已经获得的各种成就，勇敢地迎接一九五五年，这是第一个五年计划的最后一年，这是在德意志民主共和国劳动人民面前打开新的光辉的远景的一年。
    在过去的这一年中，在西德却是完全另一种景象。在那里，旧日的军国主义势力又再一次占据统治地位。一九五四年波恩统治集团公开采取了重新武装西德、使西德参加军事集团和准备新战争的方针。现在西德正竭尽全力筹备建立新的国防军，大规模生产武器。一九五四年西德经济发展的特点是，一切直接或间接为重新武装服务的工业部门都扩大了生产。同时许多和平的工业部门却出现停滞现象。
    在一九五四年年中，波恩司法机关禁止了西德青年的进步组织——自由德国青年联盟，捏造了许多反对争取和平和德国统一的战士的非法审判案。
    在一九五四年年底，西德当局为了“禁止”共产党而开始对共产党进行非法审讯。最近所通过的
  一九五五—一九五六年度的西德预算案证明，波恩统治集团执行准备战争的政策。在预算开支总数两百七十亿马克中，有九十亿马克拨给为军备开支之用。但是，甚至这项数目还是远非符合实际情况的。西德报纸，其中包括资产阶级报纸援引权威的军界人士的估计说，在武装西德方面最近的开支就达几百亿马克。
      加紧武装政策的结果是劳动人民的生活水平不断降低。西德职工的工资基本上仍停留在原有水平上，有些工业部门甚至减少了，而日用品价格却不断上涨。根据西德报纸最近的报道，在北莱因—威斯特伐利亚州，面包价格从今年十一月十日起已增加了百分之六到八。在汉堡，在十月间，牛油、香肠、鸡蛋、米粮、干酪、水果和蔬菜的价格大大增加。不来梅统计局最近公布，今年十月间蔬菜的价格比一九五三年十月增加了一倍。肉类、鱼、牛油、鸡蛋和日用品都显著地昂贵了。据德意志通讯社报道，在巴伐利亚的许多城市中，面包和其他食品的价格在最近时期平均增加了百分之十。
