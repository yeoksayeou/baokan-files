Inspiring Art
People's Artist of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, Bao Alexandrov

The musical soiree of the Song and Dance Troupe of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is a true festival for Soviet audiences and listeners, an artistic impression intertwined with the warm sympathy and love of the Soviet people for the fraternal Chinese people.

The art performed by the Song and Dance Troupe of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is permeated with revolutionary patriotism, unwavering confidence in victory, vigor, and optimism. The evening began with a solemn performance of "The Party is Our Helmsman," composed by Muradeli. Among the songs performed by the troupe, patriotic and military songs praising the motherland, the wise Communist Party and its leader Mao Zedong, the heroic deeds of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the creative labor of the Chinese people occupied a very important place. These included "March of the Chinese People's Liberation Army," composed by Zheng Lucheng with lyrics by Gong Mu in 1939, Shaanxi folk song "The East is Red" (arranged by Li Huanzhi), and "Heroes Conquer the Dadu River" (arranged by Luo Zongxian and Shi Lemeng).

In the repertoire of the Song and Dance Troupe of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, inspiring songs that realistically sing of the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people and the friendship of the people of the world also occupy a significant position. Songs belonging to this category include "Moscow-Beijing," composed by Muradeli, and "People of the World Are of One Heart," composed by Qu Xixian with lyrics by Zhao Si. A. Alexandrov's anthem "Song of the Soviet Army" has become a symbol of the friendship between the armies of the two great nations.

The song and dance troupe sang these songs with full emotion and vigor. The choir sang harmoniously and beautifully.

The excellent Chinese folk song "Little Stream Flowing" added many beautiful colors to the song due to its soft melody. Composers Meng Guibin and Shi Lemeng wrote the choral score with ingenuity. In addition, the choir sang the Polish folk song "Vistula River" with a soft and moving tone.

The female chorus of eleven members displayed profound musical talent, and a fresh breath of spring floated from their voices. The singers sang "Long Live Mao Zedong," the Korean folk song "Spring Song" composed by Li Mianxiang, and the Polish folk song "Little Cuckoo" with wonderful realism and youthful tenderness. Special mention must be made of the performance of Zakharov's famous song "Who Knows Him." The fact that this song, sung by Chinese actors, could be so heartwarming shows how much they cherish their artistic creation!

The soloists displayed extraordinary vocal cultivation and musical level. Lou Qian'gui, the winner of the singing competition at the Fourth World Youth and Student Peace and Friendship Festival, is an outstanding lyrical tenor. His voice is light and pure. He sang the Chinese folk songs "The Sun Never Sets on the Grassland" and "Grassland Love Song" naturally and expressively. In singing Lensky's aria, the most difficult part of the opera "Eugene Onegin," the soloist "portrayed" the poetic and true image of the character with extraordinary emotional depth.

The performance of the young female soloist Jiao Yunyu was also very successful. She sang wonderfully the Chinese Miao folk song "Osmanthus Blossoms Bring Happiness" (arranged by Luo Zongxian), Antonida's Romance from Glinka's opera "Ivan Susanin," and Solovyov-Sedoy's "Song of the Komsomol Members."

Special mention should also be made of the skilled and subtle accompaniment of pianist Dai Jinghua, as well as female accordionist Wang Biyun and pianist Lin Shuping.

In the song and dance troupe's program, the Chinese folk instrumental performances by leading actor Wang Hongbin were particularly interesting.

The performance of the song and dance troupe's dance team, led by dance art director Hu Guogang, was wonderful. In the diverse and magnificent dance program, each dance has its own unique style and distinct artistic image. The dance "Tibetan Cavalry" (choreographed by Fan Peng, Xue Tian, and Wang Quan), which expresses heroism and decisiveness, and the joyful, witty, and optimistic "Army Waist Drum Dance" (choreographed by Zhang Wenming and Nie Maolin) left a strong impression.

The female dancers performed the Fujian folk dance "Tea Picking and Butterfly Catching" with incomparable grace. The female accompaniment was also extremely pleasant. This is one of the song and dance troupe's small lyrical masterpieces.

"Miao Wedding Dance" (choreographed by Ren Mingyuan, Yin Peifang, and Xia Jinghan) and the Uyghur dance performed by Zohara Sakhmaeva and Marubjiang Lozhayev were also very humorous.

One of the song and dance troupe's strongest programs, as well as the most effective and universally praised by the audience, is the Chinese classical opera "Havoc in the Dragon Palace" (directed by Liu Yuantong). Chinese classical opera requires actors to undergo special training. The song and dance troupe actors Zhang Zhenwu, Guo Jinguang, Shi Tieliang, and Bai Yunjie demonstrated the amazing techniques of using their bodies with this artistic form of the Chinese people with thousands of years of tradition. In their performance, those brave, dizzying leaps and the most difficult movements are by no means for the sake of achieving success in tedious tricks, but everything is subject to the unified artistic purpose, becoming a means of artistic and figurative expression of dramatic content. Therefore, the lightness, naturalness, and beautiful modeling shown by the actors in playing their roles is truly amazing.

We are grateful to our Chinese friends for the pleasure they have brought us with their artistic performances, for the wonderful performances of excellent works of the Chinese people that they have organized for us, and for their superb acting in staging Soviet programs and programs from other countries. We believe that all the positive and good results achieved by the song and dance troupe and its leaders in this relatively short performance process are undoubtedly a guarantee for further improvement.

The song and dance troupe, whether performing as a whole, in groups, or with solo performances by leading actors, has shown a high level of performance. This should be attributed to General Chen Yi, the head of the song and dance troupe, Shi Lemeng, the artistic director and composer, Fang Ren, Hu Defeng and Feng Qi, the conductors, Hu Guogang, the dance art director, and Zhang Wenming, Nie Maolin, Ren Mingyuan, Yin Peifang, Xia Jinghan, Fan Peng, Xue Tian, Wang Quan, the choreographers, and Liu Yuantong, the director, and others.

    鼓舞人心的艺术
    俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国人民演员  鲍·亚历山德洛夫
    中国人民解放军歌舞团的音乐晚会，对于苏联观众和听众来说，是一个真正的节日，这个节日给人留下的艺术印象是和苏联人民对于兄弟的中国人民的热烈同情和热爱交织在一起的。
    中国人民解放军歌舞团所表演的艺术，渗透着革命的爱国主义激情，不可摇撼的胜利信心、锐气和乐观主义的精神。歌舞晚会以庄重地表演穆拉德里作曲的“党是我们的舵手”开始。在歌舞团所表演的歌曲中，赞美祖国、赞美英明的共产党及其领袖毛泽东，歌颂中国人民解放军英雄事迹和中国人民创造性劳动的爱国歌曲和军队歌曲，占了极重要的位置，这些歌曲就是郑律成作曲公木作词一九三九年创作的“中国人民解放军进行曲”，陕北民歌“东方红”（李焕之编曲），“英雄们战胜了大渡河”（罗宗贤、时乐濛编曲）等。
    在中国人民解放军歌舞团所表演的歌曲中，歌唱中苏人民友好、全世界人民友好这样现实性的激动人心的歌曲，也占了很重要的地位。属于这一类的歌曲，有穆拉德里作曲的“莫斯科—北京”，瞿希贤作曲、招司作词的“全世界人民心一条”。阿·亚历山大洛夫所写的赞歌“苏军之歌”，则已成为两大国军队友谊的象征。
    歌舞团演唱这些歌曲时，情绪饱满，精力充沛。合唱队唱得和谐而动听。
    优秀的中国民歌“小河淌水”，由于柔和的音调，使歌曲增添了许多美的色彩。作曲家孟贵彬和时乐濛独具匠心地写出了合唱总谱。此外合唱队还柔美地动人地演唱了波兰民歌“维斯杜拉河”。
    由十一人组成的女声合唱队，显示了深湛的音乐天才，从她们的歌声里飘荡出一股春天的清新气息。歌唱家们怀着绝妙的真实感和青春的柔情唱出了“万岁！毛泽东”，李冕相作曲的朝鲜民歌“春之歌”和波兰民歌“小杜鹃”等歌曲。扎哈洛夫的名歌“有谁知道他”的演唱，是要特别指出来的。这支歌曲从中国演员口中唱出来的时候，竟然能够如此沁人肺腑，这说明她们是何等地珍爱自己的艺术创作事业！
    独唱家们显示了非凡的声乐修养和音乐水平。第四届世界青年和学生和平友谊联欢节歌唱比赛获奖者楼乾贵，是一个出色的抒情男高音。他的声音轻快而纯净。他在演唱中国民歌“草原上升起不落的太阳”和“草原情歌”时，自然而富于表现力。在演唱歌剧“叶夫根尼·奥涅金”中最难的连斯基的咏叹调时，独唱家以异乎寻常的深入角色的情感，“刻划”了人物诗一般的真实形象。
    年轻的女声独唱家教蕴瑜的演唱也获得了很大的成功，她精彩地演唱了中国苗族民歌“桂花开放幸福来”（罗宗贤编曲），格林卡作曲的歌剧“伊凡·苏萨宁”中的安东尼达罗曼斯和索洛维耶夫—谢多伊的“共青团员之歌”。
    钢琴伴奏者戴竞华，以及女手风琴手王碧云和钢琴伴奏者林叔平的练达而微妙的伴奏，也是值得特别提及的。
    歌舞团的节目中，尤其有趣味的，是由主要演员王鸿宾表演的中国民族器乐演奏。
    舞蹈艺术指导胡果刚所领导的歌舞团舞蹈队的表演，是精彩的。在多样而瑰丽的舞蹈节目中，每一个舞蹈都有其独特的风格，都有其各不相同的艺术形象。表现英雄气概和果敢精神的舞蹈“藏民骑兵队”（范蓬、薛天、汪泉编导）及愉快、机敏和乐观的“陆军腰鼓舞”（张文明、聂茂林编导）都给人留下了强烈的印象。
    女舞蹈演员们，以无可比拟的优美舞姿表演了福建民间舞蹈“采茶扑蝶”。女声的伴唱也极为悦耳。这是歌舞团小型抒情杰作之一。
  “苗胞婚礼舞”（任明远、尹佩芳和夏静涵编导）以及左哈拉·萨赫玛也娃和马鲁不江·洛扎也夫二人表演的维吾尔族舞蹈，也很富有风趣。
    歌舞团最强的节目之一、同时也是效果最好、博得观众普遍赞扬的节目，是中国古典歌舞剧“闹龙宫”（刘元彤导演）。中国古典歌舞剧要求演员必须经过特殊的训练。歌舞团演员张振武、郭金光、史铁良和白云杰，用这种有着数千年历史传统的中国人民的艺术形式，显示了运用肢体的惊人技术。在他们所表演的艺术中，那些勇敢的，令人眩晕的腾跳和最艰难的动作，决不是为了取得乏味的把戏上的成功，而是一切服从于统一的艺术目的，成为艺术化、形象化表达戏剧内容的一种手段，因之，演员们在扮演自己角色中所表现的轻盈、自然、造型的优美是真正令人惊叹的。
    我们感激中国朋友们用自己的艺术表演给我们带来的愉快，感激他们为我们组织的中国人民优秀作品的精彩表演，感激他们在上演苏联节目和其他各国节目时的卓越演技。我们相信，歌舞团及其领导者，在这比较短促的演出过程中所取得的一切肯定的良好的结果，无疑地都是进一步提高自己的保证。
    歌舞团无论是全体表演，分组表演，抑或主要演员单独表演，均表现出了高度的表演水平。这一点，应归功于歌舞团团长陈沂将军，艺术指导兼作曲家时乐濛，指挥方韧、胡德风和丰琪，舞蹈艺术指导胡果刚和编导张文明、聂茂林、任明远、尹佩芳、夏静涵、范蓬、薛天、汪泉，及导演刘元彤等人。
