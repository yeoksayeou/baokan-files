Jiangxi is massively producing railroad ties and pit props to support national economic construction. Last year's production of railroad ties was enough to lay over 400 kilometers of railway, and pit props were sufficient for mining over 4 million tons of coal. According to the national plan, this year's total production of railroad ties and pit props will account for more than 28 percent of the province's total timber production for the year, mainly for use in coal mines such as Jiawang, Jiaozuo, and Pingxiang. At present, all logging yards have fully launched the felling and sawing work of railroad ties and pit props. It is expected that one-third of the full year's task can be completed before the Spring Festival. When the spring rains and floods arrive, a large number of railroad ties and pit props will be continuously transported to various railway construction sites and mines.

    江西大量生产枕木坑木
    江西森林工业局正大量生产枕木和坑木，支援国家经济建设。去年生产的枕木可铺四百多公里铁路，坑木可供开采四百多万吨煤。根据国家计划，今年决定枕木、坑木总生产量占省内全年木材生产总量的百分之二十八强，主要供应贾汪、焦作、萍乡等煤矿使用。现在各个伐木场已全面展开枕木坑木的采伐和制材工作，预计春节前就可完成今年全年任务的三分之一，待春雨发水季节到来，大批枕木坑木将源源运往各铁路修筑工地和矿山。
