Organize Export of New Native and Specialty Products

In 1954, the national state-owned export trade system organized the export of a large number of animal products, non-staple foods, and native and special products, exchanging them for a large amount of equipment needed for national construction. According to preliminary statistics, more than 130 new varieties of goods were exported, with a total value that could be exchanged for more than 27,700 tons of steel, or 530 54-horsepower tractors, or more than 50,000 tons of fertilizer, or 730 trucks with a load capacity of 6 tons.

Among the more than 130 new export varieties, many have never been exported in the history of our country. Such as animal products like pig large intestine tips, Siberian polecat hair, squirrel tail hair, Angora rabbit hair, and salted cattle large intestine; food products like frozen goose and pickled fish; native and special products like apricot kernel skin, peach kernel skin powder, Amomum villosum fruit, grass fans, ramie extension balls, licorice extract, and spearmint oil. Some new varieties were rarely exported in the past but were restored to export last year, such as animal products like grey-stripped cattle hair; food products like honey-yellow dates; native products like dried chili peppers, candied dates, loofah, Maotai liquor, Eucommia ulmoides, sun-cured tobacco, silk woven scenic paintings, velvet birds and animals, honey, and pigeons.

Most of these new varieties are not very useful domestically, but can be organized for export to exchange for raw materials for industrial construction. For example, pig large intestine tips were usually sold as "pig offal," but last year, a large quantity was organized for export, which can be exchanged for about 432 tons of steel. There are also native products like apricot kernel skin, which used to be burned as firewood, but can now be organized for export. Wild hemp (which can be processed into high-grade clothing material) from Hexi in Gansu, the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai Province, and southern Xinjiang Province used to be cut down in large quantities for firewood, but is now being organized for export. In addition, some of our country's abundant fruits and fish can also be organized for export to exchange for industrial construction materials.

In order to expand the source of export goods, the national state-owned export trade system is actively organizing trial sales of animal products such as salted duck yolks, duck whites, pig bladders, and cattle knee bones, foods such as cod liver oil pills, pickled pork, and smoked pork, as well as native products such as pine nuts, acorn shells, eggshell powder, pomegranate peel, and ox horns for export.

    组织土产特产新品种出口
    全国国营出口贸易系统，一九五四年组织了大量畜产品、副食品和土特产品出口，换回了大量国家建设所需要的器材。据初步统计，在出口的商品中有一百三十多种是新品种，总值可换回钢材二万七千七百多吨，或五十四匹马力的拖拉机五百三十套，或肥田粉五万多吨，或载重量六吨的汽车七百三十辆。
    在一百三十多种出口新品种中，有许多是我国历史上没有输出过的。如畜产类中的猪大肠头、石獾毛、松鼠尾毛和盎哥拉兔毛、盐牛大肠；食品类中的冻鹅、腌制的鱼类等；土特产类中的杏核皮、桃核皮粉、拉毛草果、草扇、苎麻延展球、甘草膏、留兰香油等。有一部分新品种是过去很少出口而在去年恢复出口的，如畜产类中的灰退牛毛等；食品类中的蜜黄；土产类中的辣椒干、蜜枣、丝瓜络、茅台酒和杜仲、晒烟、丝织风景画、绒制鸟兽、蜂蜜和鸽子等。
    这些新品种大部分都是在国内用处不大，而可以组织出口换回工业建设原料。如猪大肠头照例以“猪下水”出售，去年大量组织出口，约可换回钢材四百三十二吨。还有土产类中的杏核皮，过去都当柴火烧了，现在可组织出口。西北甘肃河西、青海省柴达木盆地及新疆省南疆一带的野麻（加工后可作高级衣料），过去大量被砍作柴烧，现在正组织出口。另有一部分是我国盛产的水果和鱼类，也可以组织出口，换回工业建设物资。
    为扩大出口货源，全国国营出口贸易系统，正积极组织试销鸭盐黄、鸭白、猪膀胱、牛拐头等畜产品，鱼肝油丸、腌猪肉、熏猪肉等食品，以及松子、橡壳、蛋皮粉、石榴皮、牛角等土产出口。
