Local State-Owned Industries Should Emphasize Conserving Raw Materials, Utilizing Waste Materials and Substitutes
Mei Wen

In 1954, local state-owned factories and mines in Liaoning Province emphasized the work of conserving materials, utilizing waste materials, and finding substitutes, and achieved considerable results. According to incomplete statistics, if some provincial factories and mines, and enterprises under the jurisdiction of the six cities of Dalian, Shenyang, Anshan, Fushun, Benxi, and Jinzhou, and the three counties of Xinmin, Suizhong, and Fuxian, can consolidate the experiences and results already promoted in conserving raw materials, utilizing waste materials, and using substitutes, the annual accumulation can be increased by 26.5 billion yuan.

However, some leading cadres in factories and mines still do not adequately recognize the importance of this work, feeling that "small bits and pieces are of little use." For example, the Jinzhou Furniture Woodworking Factory has been piling up 30,000 catties of leftover small timber in the yard since 1952, exposed to the elements, and much of the usable timber has turned into waste. The original five Liaodong provincial machinery factories could produce 500 tons of iron filings per year, but they were not utilized, resulting in a complete waste.

Are the small bits and pieces of waste material and iron filings really useless? The former Liaodong Provincial Farm Implement Factory added a heating furnace and used iron filings instead of pig iron to produce large pots, saving pig iron worth about 200 million yuan throughout the year. The Shenyang Brewery used waste planks from state-owned factories and mines to make packing boxes, reducing the cost of each box by 8,000 yuan, which can increase the annual accumulation by 350 million yuan. Conversely, the Shenyang Heating Equipment Factory, when producing radiators, was required by the state to mix in 20 percent recycled iron, but the factory used all good iron. In the first half of last year, it used 148 tons of good iron. The Anshan Heating Equipment Factory wasted 29.5 tons of pig iron in the second quarter of last year simply due to the product exceeding the weight limit. The Shenyang Heating Equipment Factory wasted 37.9 tons of pig iron in the first half of last year, worth more than 60 million yuan. These factories think that wasting a little doesn't matter, but many city and county-run iron factories are forced to stop production due to the lack of pig iron and iron filings.

Some leading cadres in factories and mines also pit this work against improving product quality, believing that to improve quality, the best raw materials must be used. Therefore, they are not actively seeking substitutes. The Liaoning Match Factory is a prominent example. The factory emphasizes that to improve the humidity resistance of matches, it is necessary to use the best bone glue and first-class zinc oxide from Dalian. In contrast, the Dalian Match Factory uses lithopone in the drug mixture, reducing the consumption of the valuable material zinc oxide by one-half. The Huilin Match Factory uses hide glue in combination with bone glue, with hide glue costing 6,000 yuan less per catty than bone glue. If the Liaoning Match Factory also adopted the method of using substitutes in combination with drugs like the Dalian and Huilin Match Factories, it could save 970 million yuan annually in these two items alone, accounting for 7.8 percent of the factory's total output value. The Liaoning Match Factory uses many high-quality raw materials, so logically, the quality of the matches should be better than elsewhere, but the opposite is true. The humidity resistance of matches from the Dalian and Huilin Match Factories is above 95 percent, while the humidity resistance of matches from the Liaoning Match Factory is only 90 percent, with a maximum of 95 percent.

Some leading cadres in factories and mines only give general instructions and calls for action regarding this work, without specific measures, and consider it "all done" after holding meetings and making reports. Some individual factory leaders even turn a blind eye to the serious waste within the factory while calling on workers to conserve raw materials. For example, the enamel workshop and sulfuric acid workshop of the Shenyang Enamel Factory both burn the best coal from Fushun. Since the factory has not established a system for issuing raw coal, the workers simply carry it as they use it, so the actual combustion rate of the coal is only 50 to 60 percent, and more than 40 percent of the good coal is not thoroughly burned and is thrown out of the furnace. According to statistics, these two workshops waste about 300 tons of coal throughout the year. The factory leaders believe: "There is no problem with the sales of products now, as long as the production tasks are completed."

Conserving raw materials, utilizing waste materials, and using substitutes in production can reduce product costs and directly increase social wealth. Raw materials account for 60 to 75 percent of the product cost composition of most local state-owned industrial enterprises. If the consumption of raw materials in Liaoning Province's local state-owned industries can be reduced by 2 percent, the total cost can be reduced by 1.2 percent. Since national resources should be used with priority at present, and the supply of raw materials cannot fully meet the needs of local industries for the time being, and the supply of raw materials is the material foundation for ensuring the completion and over-fulfillment of production tasks, the work of conserving raw materials, utilizing waste materials, and using substitutes should attract universal attention, and the existing experience in this area should be vigorously promoted.

    地方国营工业应重视节约原料、利用废料和代用品的工作
    枚闻
    一九五四年辽宁省地方国营各厂矿重视了节约材料、利用废料和代用品的工作，取得了不少成绩。据不完全统计，如果部分省营厂矿和旅大、沈阳、鞍山、抚顺、本溪、锦州六个市和新民、绥中、复县三个县所属的企业，能够把节约原材料、利用废料和代用品等方面已经推广的经验和获得的成果巩固下来，全年可增加积累二百六十五亿元。
    但是，现在有一些厂矿的领导干部对这一工作的重要意义还认识不足，觉得“星星点点没有多大用处”。如锦州市家具制材厂，从一九五二年到现在，把剩余的三万斤小木材都堆在院子里任凭风吹雨淋，许多能够利用的木材都变成了废物。原辽东五个省营机械厂每年能余五百吨铁末子，都没有利用，白白地浪费了。
    星星点点的废料和铁末子真的没有用处吗？原辽东省营农具厂曾添设了一座暖气炉，用铁末子代替生铁生产大锅，全年节约的生铁价值二亿元左右。沈阳酿造厂利用国营厂矿的废板皮做包装箱子，使每个箱子的成本降低了八千元，全年可增加积累三亿五千万元。相反的，沈阳市水暖器材厂在生产暖气片时，国家规定应掺入百分之二十的再生铁，该厂却全部使用了好铁，去年上半年就多用好铁一百四十八吨。鞍山水暖器材厂在去年第二季度内，仅由于产品超过重量即浪费生铁二十九点五吨。沈阳水暖器材厂去年上半年浪费了生铁三十七点九吨，价值六千余万元。这些工厂以为浪费点不算啥，但却有许多市县营铁工厂，因缺乏生铁和铁末子而被迫停止生产。
    还有些厂矿的领导干部把这项工作和提高产品质量对立起来。认为提高质量，就得使用最好的原材料。因而不积极地去寻找代用品。辽宁火柴厂就是一个突出的例子。该厂强调提高火柴耐湿度就一定要用大连最好的骨胶和一等氧化锌。与此相反，大连火柴厂用立德粉混合配药，使贵重材料氧化锌的耗用量降低了二分之一。惠临火柴厂利用皮胶配合骨胶使用，皮胶每斤比骨胶便宜六千元。假如辽宁火柴厂也采用大连、惠临火柴厂利用代用品混合配药的方法，仅这两项全年即可节约九亿七千万元，占该厂总产值的百分之七点八。辽宁火柴厂使用了许多上等原材料，按理说火柴的质量比别处的好，事实却恰恰相反，大连和惠临火柴厂火柴的耐湿度都在百分之九十五以上，而辽宁火柴厂火柴的耐湿度却仅达到百分之九十，最高才达到百分之九十五。
    还有一些厂矿领导干部对这项工作只是一般的布置和号召，没有具体措施，开了会作了报告便算“万事大吉”，甚至有个别工厂的领导干部虽在号召工人节约原材料，但是对于工厂里存在着的严重浪费现象却熟视无睹。如沈阳市珐琅厂的珐琅车间和硫酸车间都是烧抚顺最好的煤，由于工厂里没有建立原煤的领发制度，工人们用着就抬，因此煤的实烧程度仅达到百分之五十至六十，有百分之四十以上的好煤都没有烧透便从炉里掏出扔掉了。据统计，这两个车间全年共浪费煤三百吨左右。该厂领导干部却认为：“现在产品销路没问题，只要完成生产任务就行。”
    节约原材料、利用废料和代用品进行生产，能降低产品成本，直接增加社会财富。地方国营工业大部分企业产品成本构成中原材料占百分之六十至七十五，辽宁省地方国营工业原材料的消耗要能减少百分之二，就能使总成本降低百分之一点二。由于当前国家资源应重点使用，一时还不能全部满足地方工业原材料的需要，而原材料的供应工作又是保证完成与超额完成生产任务的物质基础。因此，节约原材料、利用废料及代用品的工作，应引起普遍的重视；并应大力推广这方面已有的经验。
