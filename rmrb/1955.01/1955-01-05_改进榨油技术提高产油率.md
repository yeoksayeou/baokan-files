Improving Oil Extraction Technology to Increase Oil Yield
Striving to Increase Vegetable Oil Production by 20 Million Jin

The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Industry is implementing the spirit of the National Oil and Fat Conference, actively deploying efforts to increase the province's vegetable oil production by 20 million jin in 1955. This increase accounts for one-tenth of the national increase in oil and fat production for 1955.

Jiangsu Province has a relatively developed oil industry, with 328 public and private oil mills. Currently, the oil yield in each factory is generally low. In some cases, the oil yield from machine pressing is lower than that of manual workshops. For example, the residual oil rate in dry cake produced by the Wuxi Cooperative Oil Factory using hydraulic presses is 5%, while the residual oil rate in dry cake produced by the Taizhou Cooperative Oil Factory using wooden presses is only 4.7%.

To complete the production increase task, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Industry requires all oil mills to continue vigorously promoting the Li Chuanjiang operation method and other advanced experiences.

From December 17 to 26, 1954, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Industry convened an oil industry conference. The delegates were confident that they could improve oil yield and comprehensively fulfill the national plan on the premise of ensuring quality, safe production, and reduced costs.

    Conducting Inter-Factory Competition
    
In mid-December 1954, the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government convened a provincial oil industry production conference, deciding that in 1955, the province would increase soybean oil production by 12.8 million jin without increasing raw materials by improving oil yield. In the third quarter of last year, the majority of oil factories in the province organized workers to learn the advanced experience of Li Chuanjiang, and 140 oil factories carried out mechanical repairs and added heating, billet pressing, and other equipment, preparing good conditions for improving oil yield. To complete the production increase task, 169 oil factories across the province will soon launch an inter-factory labor competition.
    
    Oil Industry Advanced Experience Exchange Meeting
    
The Hubei Provincial Department of Industry convened the Hubei Provincial Oil Industry Promotion of Advanced Experience Exchange Conference in December of last year. At the meeting, oil factories focused on learning Li Chuanjiang's advanced oil extraction method, introduced the advanced experience of the Shashi Oil Factory's mechanical pressing, the experience of the Xinzhou County Yangluo Oil Factory's earth pressing in learning Li Chuanjiang's oil extraction method, and the experience of various regions in using rice bran, rapeseed mixed with bran, and other substitutes for oil extraction. Attendees believed that if they could strengthen technical work, properly store raw materials, actively use substitutes, and learn advanced oil extraction experience in the future, they could increase edible oil production by 14 million jin this year. The conference also decided to establish the "Hubei Provincial Oil Industry Promotion of Advanced Experience Office." (Ji Zhuoru)
    
    Planning to Increase Edible Oil Production by 10 Million Jin
    
The Jiangxi Provincial First Oil Production Conference decided to vigorously promote Li Chuanjiang's advanced oil extraction experience throughout the province, striving to increase edible oil production by 10 million jin in 1955 by improving oil yield.

This conference was held in December of last year. The conference carefully analyzed the province's oil production situation, pointing out that the oil yield of sesame and rapeseed is very unbalanced and generally low, failing to meet the national standards. According to experiments, improving the operating method for pressing peanut oil can yield an additional three jin of oil per hundred jin of oilseeds. The output of oilseeds will also increase in 1955. Therefore, the conference pointed out that as long as Li Chuanjiang's advanced oil extraction experience is earnestly promoted, the goal of increasing edible oil production throughout the province by improving oil yield can be achieved.

    Further Promoting Li Chuanjiang's Oil Extraction Method
    
The 75 state-owned, locally state-owned, and private vegetable oil factories in Tianjin have initially determined to increase vegetable oil production for the country by more than 2.8 million jin this year without increasing oilseeds.

Since mid-November of last year, many vegetable oil factories in Tianjin have successively learned Li Chuanjiang's advanced oil extraction method, and the oil yield of oilseeds has increased. The factories are prepared to further promote Li Chuanjiang's advanced oil extraction method and increase oil yield this year, increasing the production of large quantities of vegetable oil for the country. Last year, the China Oil and Fat Chemical Factory produced approximately 14.97 jin of refined cottonseed oil per hundred jin of cottonseed. This year, it plans to increase this to 15.73 jin. The locally state-owned Tianjin Vegetable Oil Factory and various private oil factories also plan to increase the oil yield of oilseeds such as cottonseed, peanuts, soybeans, and castor beans.

To ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of this year's production increase task, many oil factories are actively carrying out production preparation work. The National Office for Promoting Advanced Oil Extraction Methods is also organizing technicians and workers from many vegetable oil factories in Tianjin to establish training classes to learn advanced operating methods. Employees of some factories have also conducted mutual observation and learning.
    
    Summarizing the Experience of Cottonseed Oil Extraction
    
The Jinnan Special District of Shanxi Province has more than 1,700 earth oil presses, with an average oil yield of only about 13 jin per hundred jin of cottonseed. However, a oil mill in Jiang County, due to the workers' efforts to learn advanced oil extraction technology, the oil yield reached more than 16.5 jin, with a maximum of 17.2 jin. The relevant departments of the Jinnan Special District summarized the oil extraction experience of Jiang County, and on November 24, 1954, convened a district-wide exchange meeting on earth-pressed cottonseed experience in Jiang County. During the meeting, the conference organized workers to conduct oil extraction tests on cottonseed brought by various counties. A total of eight tests were conducted, with an average oil yield of 17.2 jin and a maximum of 17.13 jin, setting the highest record for earth-pressed cottonseed oil yield in Jinnan. The above facts educated every worker who attended the meeting. Everyone unanimously believed that "Only by improving oil extraction technology and learning advanced oil extraction experience can we increase oil yield." The meeting calculated that if an extra 1.5 jin of oil could be extracted from every hundred jin of cottonseed, the state could increase edible oil by more than 2.79 million jin from the unified purchase of oilseeds in the Jinnan Special District, enough for the people of Taiyuan to consume for five months. (Feng Qigong)

    Constantly Improving Soybean Oil Yield
    
After the employees of the Joint State-Private JinHua Oil Extraction Factory in Zhejiang Province learned the advanced experience of the "Li Chuanjiang Soybean Oil Extraction Method," the soybean oil yield has been constantly improving. From November 13 to 23, 1954, the average oil yield per hundred jin of soybeans was 15.33 jin. By the 25th, the oil yield had reached 16.27 jin, and on the 27th, a new record of 16.8 jin was created.

The methods used by the Jinhua Oil Extraction Factory to improve oil yield are: further mastering the "softening" process, adopting the method of spraying water and simmering soybeans to ensure that the moisture is absorbed evenly and deeply, making it easy to roll into flakes. At the same time, the labor organization was adjusted, and the assembly line operation method was promoted, strictly controlling the cake wrapping time. There were also improvements in the pressing method, such as adopting quick topping and quick pressing before the oil comes out, and diligent pressing and tight pressing after the oil comes out, completely materializing Li Chuanjiang's advanced experience. Now, the Industry Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial Department of Industry have sent people to this factory to summarize experience for promotion.
                                   (Li Yu, Tu Xiufeng)
    
    Oil Extraction Depends on Technology
    
Many local state-owned, cooperative-run, and some private oil and fat factories in Zhenjiang Special District, Jiangsu Province, educated workers with easy-to-understand scientific oil extraction principles and advanced operating methods, criticized conservative and backward thinking, improved the technical level of workers, and smoothly promoted Li Chuanjiang's soybean oil extraction and other advanced experiences. Originally, a common saying prevailed among workers: "Oil extraction depends on strength; no strength, no oil." Workers in a private factory in Liyang described earth oil extraction as: "Eighteen pieces of wood are moved back and forth, and a fifty-jin hammer is struck back and forth." After learning the principles of oil extraction and advanced operating methods, the technical knowledge and operating level of many workers have been greatly improved. Zhang Ming-san, an old worker at the Wujin No. 1 Processing Factory, said: "I have been extracting oil for more than thirty years, and I didn't know how oil came out. Now I know that oil extraction depends on technology." After technical education and improved production management, the oil yield of various oil extraction raw materials in the entire special district increased. Compared with 1953, the oil yield of soybeans in the second and third quarters of 1954 increased by one to three jin or more; the oil yield of rapeseed increased by three to six jin. (Zhao Fuxiang)

    More Oil Than Usual

The staff and workers of the Pingyuan County Oil Mill in Shandong Province responded to the call to increase oil production by 200 million jin nationwide in 1955, actively improved operating methods, and improved oil yield. After learning Li Chuanjiang's advanced oil extraction experience, the staff and workers created new operating methods for manual pressing, including concentrated stacking, decentralized cake peeling, and mixing grass seeds into the cake. The Tang Xuezeng group used the new operating method to experiment, yielding about seventeen or eighteen jin of oil per hundred jin of cottonseed, nearly two or three jin more oil than usual. In the days from November 21 to 23, 1954, the average oil yield per hundred jin of cottonseed in the entire factory reached 16.492 jin. (Guo Tongjun)

    Improved Flaxseed Oil Yield
    
In November 1954, the business offices of the Yanbei Oil and Fat Branch Company in Shanxi Province organized the oil mills in the county towns to conduct trial pressing work to improve flaxseed oil yield. The results of the trial pressing showed that the average oil yield per hundred jin of flaxseed in the entire Yanbei Special District reached 31.5 jin, breaking the record of 30 jin of oil per hundred jin of flaxseed in the first half of the year, and also exceeding the standard of 30.5 jin of oil yield stipulated by the higher authorities. This fact reversed the idea of some cadres who believed that this year's flaxseed was not full, the quality was poor, and the oil yield was low. The entire district processed 3.1 million jin of flaxseed in November, increasing the oil yield by a total of 31,000 jin. (Wei Yunpeng, Liu Wenfu)

    Oil Yield Has Not Reached Its Limit
    
Employees of the Southwest Region Oil and Fat Company system and the cooperative system are actively increasing oil yield from existing oilseeds and have achieved great results. Taking rapeseed oil, which is consumed by most people in the region and has the largest production volume, as an example, the oil yield per hundred jin of rapeseed is as high as 43.9 jin in Sichuan Province; 37.2 jin in Guizhou Province; 36 jin in Yunnan Province; and 40 jin in Xikang Province. If calculated based on a 2% increase in oil yield, the increase in rapeseed oil in the entire region is equivalent to increasing the wealth of the country by 59 billion yuan.

From the perspective of equipment, the oil extraction tools in the Southwest are still quite backward, with most of them being earth presses such as ramming presses, pounding presses, and pressing presses scattered in rural areas. Many oil extraction units promptly criticized the complacency of "oil yield has reached its limit" and the conservative thinking on technology among the staff and workers, absorbed the advanced experience of Li Chuanjiang's soybean oil extraction, and the method of Zhejiang and other places of mixing rice husks and straw for oil extraction, increasing the oil yield. After Bijie Special District in Guizhou absorbed Zhejiang's method of mixing rice straw and husks for oil extraction, the oil yield per hundred jin of rapeseed increased by one to two jin. (Yuan Zhuxuan)

    Oil Extraction Technology Training Class
    
Oil extraction technology training classes have been opened in Siping, Dalian, Qingdao, Baoding, Tianjin, Yangzhou and other places. These training classes are directly led by the local industrial bureaus and designate a local oil factory to be responsible for hosting them. The training classes will adopt the method of combining lecturing, learning, and discussion, combining theory and practice for teaching. Through this study, the trainees should not only be able to perform actual operations in accordance with advanced operating methods, but also understand why they should operate in this way, and be able to take apprentices after returning.

According to the decision of the National Oil Industry Advanced Experience Exchange Conference, after the training classes are over, a group of technicians will also be transferred from various advanced factories to work with the technicians who participated in the study to conduct experiments in key oil factories in various regions, and in conjunction with pilot projects, train local oil extraction technicians and hold short-term training classes.

    改进榨油技术提高产油率
    为增产两千万斤植物油而努力
    江苏省工业厅贯彻全国油脂会议的精神，积极部署为争取一九五五年全省增产二千万斤植物油而努力。这一增产计划占全国一九五五年油脂增产计划的十分之一。
    江苏省油脂工业比较发达，公私营榨油工厂有三百二十八家。目前，各厂产油率一般较低，甚至有些油厂机器压榨的产油率低于手工作坊的人力榨。如无锡合作油厂用水压机生产干饼残油率达百分之五，而泰州合作油厂木榨的干饼，残油率只有百分之四点七。
    为了完成增产任务，江苏省工业厅要求各油厂继续大力推广李川江操作法和其他先进经验。
    从一九五四年十二月十七日到二十六日，江苏省工业厅召开了油脂工业会议，到会代表都有信心在保证质量、安全生产、降低成本的前提下，提高产油率和全面地完成国家计划。
                        （本报江苏记者站）
    开展厂际竞赛
    黑龙江省人民政府在一九五四年十二月中旬召开了全省油脂工业生产会议，决定一九五五年全省在不增加原料的条件下，提高产油率，为国家增产一千二百八十万斤豆油。全省绝大部分油厂在去年第三季度组织工人学习了李川江先进经验，并有一百四十个油厂进行机械检修，增添了加热、压坯等设备，为提高产油率准备了良好条件。为了完成增产任务，全省一百六十九个油厂即将展开厂际劳动竞赛。油脂工业先进经验交流会
    湖北省工业厅在去年十二月间召开了湖北省油脂工业推广先进经验交流大会，会上，各油厂着重学习了李川江的先进榨油法，介绍了沙市油厂机榨的先进经验，和新洲县阳逻油厂土榨学习李川江榨油法的经验，以及各地采用米糠、菜籽掺糠等代用品榨油的经验等。到会者认为，今后如果能加强技术工作，善于保管原料，积极运用代用品和学习先进榨油经验，今年可以增产食油一千四百万斤。会议并决定成立“湖北省油脂工业推广先进经验办公室”。（纪卓如）
    计划增产食油一千万斤
    江西省第一次油脂生产会议决定在全省各地大力推广李川江先进榨油经验，争取一九五五年全省从提高出油率方面增产食油一千万斤。
    这次会议是去年十二月间举行的。会议仔细分析了全省油脂生产情况，指出目前芝麻和油菜籽的出油率很不平衡，一般都比较低，没有达到国家规定的标准。据试验，如改进榨花生油的操作法，每百斤油料可以多出三斤油。一九五五年油料产量也将增加。因此，会议指出只要认真推广李川江先进榨油经验，全省从提高出油率方面增产食油的目标是能够实现的。（新华社）
    进一步推广李川江榨油法
    津市七十五家国营、地方国营和私营植物油厂已初步确定在不增加油料的条件下，今年为国家增产植物油二百八十多万斤。
    津市许多植物油厂在去年十一月中旬开始，先后学习了李川江先进榨油法，油料产油率有了提高。各厂准备在今年进一步推广李川江先进榨油法，提高产油率，为国家增产大量植物油。中国油脂化学厂去年每百斤棉籽产精棉籽油约十四点九七斤，今年计划提高到十五点七三斤。地方国营天津植物油厂、各私营油厂也计划将棉籽、花生、大豆、蓖麻子等油料的产油率提高。
    为了保证今年增产任务的完成和超额完成，许多油厂正积极进行生产准备工作。全国推广先进榨油法办公室也正组织津市许多植物油厂的技术人员和工人成立训练班，学习先进操作法。有些工厂的职工还互相进行了观摩学习。
    总结棉籽榨油的经验
    山西晋南专区有土榨油坊一千七百多个，平均每百斤棉籽的产油量只有十三斤上下。但是绛县有一个油坊，由于工人努力学习先进的榨油技术，产油量达到十六斤半以上，最高达十七斤二两。晋南专区有关部门总结了绛县的榨油经验，一九五四年十一月二十四日并在绛县召开了全区土榨棉籽经验交流会议。在会议期中，大会组织工人对各县带来的棉籽进行榨油试验，共试榨八次，平均出油十七斤二两，最高达十七斤十三两，创造了晋南土榨棉籽产油率的最高纪录。以上事实教育了到会的每一个工人。大家一致认为：“只有提高榨油技术，学习先进榨油经验，才能提高产油率。”会议计算了一下，如果每百斤棉籽能多出一斤半油，国家在晋南专区的油料统购，就可增加食油二百七十九万多斤，够太原市人民五个月的食用。（封其功）
    不断提高大豆产油量
    浙江省公私合营金华榨油厂全体职工学习“李川江大豆榨油法”先进经验以后，大豆产油量不断提高，一九五四年十一月十三日到二十三日，平均每百斤大豆的产油量为十五点三三斤，到二十五日，产油量已达到十六点二七斤，二十七日再创十六斤八两的新纪录。
    金华榨油厂提高产油率的办法是：进一步掌握“软化”过程，采用了喷水焖豆的办法，使水分吃得均匀深透，轧起片来很容易。同时调整了劳动组织，推行了流水作业法，严密控制了包饼时间。在压榨方法上也有改进，如未出油前，采用快顶快压，出油以后，采用勤压紧压，把李川江的先进经验完全具体化了。现在，中共浙江省委工业部和省工业厅，已派人到这个厂总结经验，以便推广。
                      （李　煜　屠秀峰）
    榨油要靠技术
    江苏省镇江专区许多地方国营、合作社营和部分私营油脂工厂，用通俗易懂的科学榨油原理和先进操作法教育工人，批判保守落后思想，提高了工人的技术水平，顺利地推广了李川江大豆榨油等先进经验。原来在工人中，普遍流行一种说法：“打油就凭力气，没力气打不出油来。”溧阳一个私营厂的工人形容土法榨油时说：“十八块木头搬来搬去，五十斤的榔头打来打去。”经过对榨油原理和先进操作法的学习，许多工人的技术知识和操作水平大大提高了。武进第一加工厂老工人张明三说：“我吃了三十多年榨油饭，不晓得油是怎样出来的，现在我才知道要凭技术榨油。”各厂经过技术教育并改进生产管理以后，全专区各种榨油原料产油率提高了。一九五四年第二、三季度与一九五三年比较，黄豆产油率提高了一斤到三斤以上；菜籽产油率提高了三斤到六斤。（赵复骧）
    比平常多出油
    山东省平原县制油厂职工，响应一九五五年全国计划增产两亿斤油的号召，积极改进操作方法，提高了产油率。职工们学习了李川江榨油的先进经验后，创造了人力榨集中装垛、分散扒饼和饼中掺草子的新的操作法。唐学增小组用新的操作法试验，每百斤棉籽出油十七斤、十八斤左右，比平常多出油近二、三斤，全厂在一九五四年十一月二十一日至二十三日几天中，每百斤棉籽的平均产油量已达到十六点四九二斤。　（郭同均）
    提高了胡麻的产油量
    山西省雁北油脂分公司各县经营处，一九五四年十一月份组织各县城关榨油坊进行了提高胡麻产油量的试榨工作。试榨结果，全雁北专区平均每百斤胡麻的产油量达到三十一斤半，打破了上半年每百斤胡麻产油三十斤的纪录，也突破了上级规定的产油量三十斤半的标准。这个事实，扭转了某些干部认为今年胡麻不饱满，质量差，产油低的想法。全区十一月份加工三百十万斤胡麻，共提高了产油量三万一千斤。　（魏云鹏　刘文富）
    产油量并没有到顶
    西南区油脂公司系统职工和合作社系统职工，积极从现有油料中提高产油率，已获得很大成绩。以全区人民食用最多、生产量最大的菜籽油来说，每百斤菜籽产油量，四川省最高达四十三斤九两；贵州省达三十七斤二两；云南省达三十六斤；西康省达四十斤。如按提高产油率百分之二计算，全区增产的菜油等于给国家增产五百九十亿元的财富。
    从设备上看，西南的榨油工具还相当落后，绝大部分都是散布在农村的撞榨、捶榨、压榨等土榨。许多榨油单位在职工群众中及时地批判了“出油到顶”的自满情绪和技术上的保守思想，吸收了李川江大豆榨油的先进经验，和浙江等地用谷壳、稻草掺和榨油的方法，提高了产油率。贵州毕节专区吸收浙江掺用稻草、谷壳榨油后，每百斤菜籽提高产油量一斤到两斤。　（袁注轩）
    榨油技术训练班
    四平、旅大、青岛、保定、天津、扬州等地开办了榨油技术训练班。这些训练班由当地的工业厅（局）直接领导，指定当地一个油厂负责主办。训练班将采用边讲课、边学习、边讨论、理论和实际相结合的方法进行教学。通过这次学习，要使学习的人员不但能按照先进操作法进行实际操作，并且懂得为什么要这样操作的道理，能在回去后带徒弟。
    根据全国油脂工业先进经验交流大会的决定，在训练班结束后，还要从各先进工厂中抽调一批技术工人分赴各地协同这次参加学习的技工，在各地区的重点油厂进行试验，并结合试点，训练当地榨油技工，举办短期训练班。
