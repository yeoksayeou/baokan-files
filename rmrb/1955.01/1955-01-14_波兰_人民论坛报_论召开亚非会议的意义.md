Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, December 12th: The Polish "People's Tribune" published an article on the 11th entitled "A Conference of Two Continents," commenting on the important significance of the Bogor Conference of the Five Prime Ministers of South Asia in deciding to convene the Asian-African Conference.

The article first pointed out that in the past few years, no other continent has experienced such stormy developments and such tremendous political changes as Asia. Among these political changes, the most important are: the victory of the Chinese revolution, the independence of other Asian countries, the great victory of the Vietnamese people in their national liberation struggle, the Korean people's repelling of American aggression, the birth of friendly relations between new Asian countries (regardless of their systems), the firm stance taken by Asian countries against colonialism, and the isolation of imperialist puppets.

The article said that the Asian-African Conference, in which a majority of Asian countries and many African countries will participate, represents a total of approximately 1.5 billion people. This means that the conference will speak for more than half of the world's population.

The article said that the fact that the People's Republic of China was invited to participate in the Asian-African Conference is extremely important. This proves that the conveners of the conference want to make it a meeting where Asian and African countries can conduct the broadest and most effective discussions. The invitation of People's China proves China's prestige in Asia.

The article concluded that the resolutions of the Bogor Conference of the Five Prime Ministers of South Asia reflect the tremendous changes taking place in the world, especially in Asia. The U.S. State Department has suffered a major defeat precisely because it is unwilling to recognize this change. Convening the Asian-African Conference is another such failure for them.

    波兰“人民论坛报”论召开亚非会议的意义
    【新华社华沙十二日电】波兰“人民论坛报”十一日刊载一篇题为“两大洲的会议”的文章，评论南亚五国总理茂物会议决定召开亚非会议的重要意义。
    文章首先指出，在过去几年中，没有其他任何一洲像亚洲一样，发生过这样暴风骤雨般的发展，经历过这样巨大的政治变化。这些政治变化中，最重要的有：中国革命的胜利，其他亚洲国家的独立，越南人民在民族解放斗争中取得的巨大胜利，朝鲜人民打退了美国侵略，在新的亚洲国家（无论它们的制度如何）之间的友好关系的诞生，亚洲国家采取的反对殖民主义的坚决立场，以及帝国主义的傀儡的孤立。
    文章说，多数亚洲国家和许多非洲国家将参加亚非会议，这个会议代表着共约十五亿人民。这就意味着这个会议将代表地球上一半以上的居民说话。
    文章说，中华人民共和国被邀请参加亚非会议这一事实是极端重要的。这证明召开会议的人要使这个会议成为亚非国家能进行最广泛、最有效的讨论的会议。人民中国的被邀请证明了中国在亚洲享有的威望。
    文章最后说，南亚五国总理茂物会议的决议反映了世界上，特别是亚洲正在发生的巨大变化。美国国务院正是由于对这种变化不愿意加以承认，他们遭到了重大的失败。召开亚非会议就是他们又一次的这种失败。
