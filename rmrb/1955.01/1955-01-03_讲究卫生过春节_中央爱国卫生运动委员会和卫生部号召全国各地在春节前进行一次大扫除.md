Emphasizing Hygiene for a Clean Spring Festival
The Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee and the Ministry of Health Call on All Parts of the Country to Conduct a Thorough Cleaning Before the Spring Festival

The Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee and the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China jointly issued a notice on December 30th of last year, calling on all parts of the country to conduct a thorough cleaning before the Spring Festival, combining it with the mass custom of sweeping away dust.

The notice first pointed out: The custom of sweeping away dust before the Spring Festival among the Chinese people is a good tradition of cleanliness and hygiene among the masses, which has been passed down for a long time. If we further strengthen organized leadership and propaganda education to carry out a universal health campaign, it will be of great benefit. The notice requires all parts of the country, whether urban or rural, to select an appropriate time before the Spring Festival to mobilize the masses to conduct a thorough cleaning, calling on the masses to "greet the Spring Festival in a clean and tidy manner."

The notice pointed out: We must eliminate overwintering mosquitoes and flies through thorough indoor and outdoor cleaning, in order to reduce the breeding conditions for mosquitoes and flies after the beginning of spring, and prevent various diseases that mosquitoes and flies may transmit when the weather turns warm. In order to achieve the above goals, local health departments should vigorously carry out health publicity and education work to the masses, and must explain to the masses clearly the harm of mosquitoes and flies, their breeding conditions, overwintering methods, the significance of eliminating mosquitoes and flies in winter, and the methods of eliminating mosquitoes and flies that can be done by the power of the masses.

The notice concluded: Local Patriotic Health Campaign Committees and local health administrative departments should seize the opportunity, act proactively, and promptly arrange and supervise inspections; and organize and give play to the role of health organizations, health models, and health work activists among the masses.

    讲究卫生过春节
    中央爱国卫生运动委员会和卫生部号召全国各地在春节前进行一次大扫除
    中央爱国卫生运动委员会和中华人民共和国卫生部于去年十二月三十日联合发出通知，号召全国各地在春节前结合群众扫尘习惯，进行一次清洁大扫除。
    通知中首先指出：我国人民在春节前的扫尘习惯，是群众中一种爱清洁、讲卫生的好风俗，已流传很久，如果再加以有组织的领导和宣传教育，来普遍进行一次卫生活动，就有很大的好处。通知中要求全国各地，无论城市、农村都要在春节前选定适当时期，动员群众进行一次清洁大扫除，号召群众“干干净净过春节”。
  通知中指出：要通过室内外大清扫来消灭越冬蚊蝇，以减少蚊蝇在开春后的繁殖条件，防止气候转暖时蚊蝇可能传染的各种疾病。为了达到以上目的，各地卫生部门应向群众大力开展卫生宣传教育工作，必须把蚊蝇的害处、孳生条件、越冬方法、冬天灭蚊蝇的意义以及群众力量所能办到的灭蚊蝇方法等向群众解释清楚。
    通知最后指出：各地爱国卫生运动委员会和各地卫生行政部门，应抓紧时机，积极行动起来，及时布置与进行督促检查；并要组织与发挥群众中的卫生组织、卫生模范和卫生工作积极分子的作用。　　（据新华社讯）
