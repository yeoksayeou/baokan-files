Editor's note: Some of our party organizations have neglected the work of consolidating and developing the party's propaganda network, and have neglected to give full play to the role of the propaganda network in various tasks. The issues raised in this article are worthy of attention by party organizations in various localities. Party organizations in various localities should conduct a general reorganization of the party's propaganda network in accordance with the spirit of the Central Committee's "Decision on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the People Throughout the Party." The methods of reorganizing the propaganda network proposed in this article can be used as a reference for party organizations in various localities. This article was originally published in the January 1st issue of Shandong Dazhong Daily. This newspaper has made slight deletions and modifications when reprinting it.

I

On January 1, 1951, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the "Decision on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the People Throughout the Party." According to this decision, Shandong party organizations began the work of establishing the party's propaganda network throughout the province. By 1952, more than 450,000 propagandists had been developed, forming a huge party propaganda force. This party propaganda force played a certain role in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and other political movements, as well as in increasing production and practicing economy, democratic reform, production reform, and other economic construction tasks. They widely publicized the party's policies, raised the consciousness of the masses, strengthened the ties between the party and the masses, and promoted the victorious completion of various tasks; at the same time, they also advanced the party's propaganda work by a big step. During this period, both cadres and the masses believed that propagandists were useful. Cadres said, "With propagandists, the work is easier, and there are fewer cases of coercion and commandism." The masses said, "With propagandists, we can hear about all the major national events, and we feel much clearer in our hearts." This proves that the Central Committee's decision to establish a propaganda network is completely correct and feasible, and it has constructive significance for regularly and systematically conducting propaganda to the masses, strengthening and strengthening the ties between the party and the masses, and improving the party's leadership style. Therefore, it is welcomed by the vast number of party members, cadres, and the people.

At the beginning of 1953, according to the instructions of the Central Committee, Shandong party organizations launched a struggle against bureaucracy and decentralism throughout the province, which was necessary. Bureaucracy and decentralism are a reflection of bourgeois ideology and style. At any time and in any place, as long as there is bureaucracy and decentralism, it must be opposed. However, some deviations and errors occurred in the struggle against bureaucracy and decentralism. The more than 450,000 propagandists who had been established for two years were also regarded as superfluous. Some responsible comrades of the prefectural committees publicly declared at meetings that the propaganda network was the main cause of the chaos in the countryside and was one of the "five excesses," demanding that it be abolished; some municipal committees had made decisions to withdraw party member cadres from the propaganda network in factories, believing that this was a good way to reduce the chaos among party member cadres, and conducted typical experiments. Individual responsible comrades also innovatively proposed the idea that "technicians are propagandists." According to their views, of course, propagandists could be dispensed with. Although these remarks and actions were opposed by general comrades and did not result in a unified written regulation to abolish the party's propaganda network, nor were they able to be implemented smoothly throughout the province, the party's propaganda network was "reversed" or shelved and became nominal in most areas. After such a year, most district and township cadres, and even responsible cadres at the county level, had forgotten what the propaganda network was for. Precisely because of this, because of the neglect of propaganda work, and because the party's propaganda network was abolished and could not regularly conduct propaganda to the masses, the coercive and commanding style of party members and cadres developed, the spontaneous capitalist tendencies of the peasants grew, the relationship between the party and the masses was damaged, and the chaotic and tense situation in work actually increased even more. All these evil consequences were concentratedly exposed in the work of unified purchase and sale of grain in the winter of 1953. This proves that propaganda work cannot be neglected in the slightest, the party's propaganda network cannot be abolished, and the party's political work in factories and rural areas is not "excessive," but insufficient. Any attempt to weaken the party's propaganda work among the masses is wrong.

In 1954, the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party and the documents of the Second National Propaganda Work Conference were widely disseminated and studied within the leading organs of party organizations at all levels, and past mistakes were cleared, thus providing sufficient conditions for improving the party's propaganda work throughout the province.

Over the past year, with the gradual improvement of the party's leadership style, the Shandong party organization's propaganda work has also made some improvements. In last year's summer wheat unified purchase work, especially in the autumn requisition and purchase work, party organizations at all levels repeatedly educated party members and the masses, and a large part of the region reorganized the propaganda network through various propaganda work. For example, in Shouguang County, 82 townships have reorganized more than 70 townships' propaganda networks. In such areas, the role of propagandists has been brought into play, mass propaganda work has been carried out more deeply, and the understanding of cadres and the masses has also changed. Cadres reflected: "In the past, we suffered from not paying attention to the propaganda network. This autumn is different: there are more people, more mouths, the work is smooth, and the masses are satisfied!" The masses reflected: "There are fewer meetings and more things we know." This time, the unified purchase work was much more complicated than the unified purchase work in the winter of 1953—not only grain was purchased, but also cotton and oil crops. At the same time, due to the mistakes made in the previous unified purchase work, the adverse effects on the masses also increased the difficulty of this unified purchase work. However, this unified purchase work, although not completely over, is much smoother from the previous stage of work, the task is completed quickly, and the masses are relatively satisfied; compared with the last unified purchase work, the situation is very different. What is the reason? We believe that the universal emphasis on propaganda work and the partial play of the role of the party's propaganda network cannot but be one of the important reasons. However, it must be pointed out that the improvement of propaganda work in the past year has been very insufficient, especially the play of the role of the party's propaganda network has been very insufficient. Many responsible comrades of county, district, and township party organizations have not paid attention to the party's propaganda network and still have many confused views; a large part of the region's propaganda network has not yet begun to be reorganized, and they have not even figured out who the propagandists are; some responsible comrades of counties, districts, and townships have paid attention to the propaganda network, but they still do not know how to manage and use the propaganda network to give full play to its role. Therefore, how to conscientiously reorganize the party's propaganda network throughout the province, give full play to the role of propagandists, and establish regular and organized mass propaganda work to further strengthen the relationship between the party and the masses, thoroughly overcome the coercive and commanding style, and promote the victorious progress of various tasks is still an important task for party committees at all levels, especially the propaganda departments of party committees, in the future.

II

In order to reorganize the party's propaganda network well and give full play to its role, what problems exist? How can these problems be solved? We believe that there are the following aspects:

First, it is necessary to correct the understanding of the party's propaganda network. Some comrades do not pay attention to the party's propaganda network, and even think that it can be abolished, mainly because they have many confused views about the propaganda network. They said: "Didn't we work the same way in the past without establishing a propaganda network?" "If party members, Youth League members, and activists are doing propaganda work, why do we need to establish a propaganda network? Isn't that just creating trouble?" "Let the masses be propagandists! Why do party members and cadres have to do it? Aren't the masses doing the same propaganda?" These statements are obviously incorrect. Propagandizing to the masses is one of the fine traditions of our party, and the obligation of party members to do propaganda work has long been enshrined in the Party Constitution. Why did the Central Committee of the Party issue the decision to establish the party's propaganda network? Let's see what the decision says: "One of the main weaknesses of the party's current propaganda work among the people is that party organizations at all levels often regard it as the work of a few people and as a temporary task, and have not established the necessary system to make it a regular task for all communists, and give it systematic leadership and management by party committees at all levels." "The lack of regularity and organization in propaganda work among the people will inevitably hinder communists from effectively fulfilling their responsibilities, allow the propaganda activities of counter-revolutionaries and the spread of wrong ideas, hinder the strengthening of the ties between the party and the people, hinder the party's struggle to overcome the tendency of bureaucracy and commandism, and make it easy for some party members to be absorbed in simple administrative orders rather than persuasive explanations when working among the people. The Party must resolutely eliminate this phenomenon and strengthen propaganda work among the people. To this end, it is necessary to systematically establish a regular propaganda network for the people..." This tells us: first, although we have done a lot of propaganda work in the past, there are major shortcomings, that is, the lack of regularity and organization; second, although communists have the responsibility of propaganda work, because propaganda work lacks organization and has not established the necessary system, it hinders communists from effectively fulfilling their responsibilities; third, without regular and organized mass propaganda work, it will allow bad elements to spread rumors, hinder the connection between the Party and the masses, and hinder the struggle to overcome bureaucratism and commandism. From this, we can fully understand: the propaganda network is a system (not an organization) that guarantees that the Party can regularly and systematically conduct propaganda among the people, and guarantees that party members can effectively fulfill their responsibilities. Propagandists are the core force for the Party to conduct propaganda among the people. Through this core force, the whole party and the party's activists are led to conduct organized and regular propaganda work among the people. In this way, how can the propaganda network be dispensable? How can party members not serve as propagandists? Today, it is still individual cases that the leading comrades of party organizations at all levels completely ignore propaganda work, but the general understanding of the important significance of establishing regular propaganda work is insufficient. More common is to simply regard propaganda work as a means to complete a specific task. Therefore, propaganda is carried out when a task comes, and propaganda work is over when the task is over. In this way, it is difficult to recognize the necessity of establishing a propaganda network. The establishment of a propaganda network is interrelated with the establishment of regular propaganda work. This point is also clearly stated in the Central Committee's decision to establish a propaganda network. Propaganda work is the driving force for promoting various tasks, but propaganda work is by no means just for completing a specific task; its main roles are: ensuring the correct dissemination of the Party's ideology, policies, and guidelines, continuously improving the socialist consciousness of the people, inspiring the labor enthusiasm of the people; refuting various reactionary rumors and wrong ideas circulating among the people; strengthening the ties between the Party and the masses, and correcting the coercive and commanding style of party members. Because propaganda work has such multiple and significant meanings, it must be carried out regularly and in an organized manner, and the Party's propaganda network must be established to ensure the realization of this task. Only by recognizing the great significance of establishing regular mass propaganda work can we recognize the necessity of establishing a propaganda network. Recently, the Propaganda Department of the Shandong Sub-bureau of the CPC Central Committee reissued the CPC Central Committee's "Decision on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the People Throughout the Party" in order to draw the attention of party organizations at all levels to the propaganda network. It is hoped that all party comrades will study this document again to clarify some remaining confused views and effectively manage the party's propaganda network.

Secondly, we must change the "mass movement" and generalized working style in propaganda work. In the past few years, we have done a lot of propaganda work, but up to now, we are still accustomed to the set of political movements, holding large meetings, making big reports, and making a lot of noise, but we lack an in-depth and meticulous working style, so we will not feel the necessity of establishing a regular propaganda network. Precisely because we are accustomed to and even satisfied with this set of "mass movements," some cadres have developed a kind of illusion that propaganda work only requires holding meetings and making reports, and it seems like we are just asking for trouble to establish a propaganda network. Really, if propaganda work only requires holding meetings and making reports, then a few responsible persons of the Party committee can completely "take care of" it. Indeed, we don't need any propagandists, and even the propaganda department can be dispensed with. However, the problem is not that simple. Mass propaganda work not only has the important significance as mentioned above, but also aims to solve a specific ideological problem of the masses, or to publicize a specific task to the masses. It is by no means possible to achieve the goal by relying on one or two big reports. The main role of a general big report can often only produce an enlightening or inspiring effect, and to truly solve various different and specific ideological problems among the masses, it is necessary to have in-depth and meticulous persuasive explanations. To carry out in-depth and meticulous persuasive explanation work, we cannot rely solely on a few responsible persons of the Party committee, but must rely on the whole party, especially on the core force of the whole party engaged in mass propaganda work - propagandists. In the past, the introduction of experience in mass propaganda work in our leadership has often focused on the set of big noise and big movement. In the future, we must pay special attention to cultivating an in-depth and meticulous propaganda working style, and introduce more in-depth and meticulous propaganda working experience, so that the leadership of party organizations at all levels can recognize the great role of the regular propaganda network from the experience of specific work; at the same time, the in-depth and meticulous working style can be cultivated from the work of establishing the regular propaganda network.

Thirdly, we must strengthen the regular education and management of propagandists and effectively correct the past practice of only using propagandists without education. In the past, party committees at all levels, in accordance with the spirit of the Central Committee's decision, had established some systems for the education of propagandists, such as the teaching system, the propagandist conference or the propagandist representative conference system. Regardless of the weaknesses of these systems themselves, they played a role to varying degrees in improving the quality of propagandists and bringing their strength into play. With the "reversal" of the propaganda network in 1953, these systems were naturally the first to be "reversed." Now, when we start to reorganize the propaganda network, we must first gradually establish some necessary systems in our work to strengthen the regular education and management of propagandists. Without regular education, it is impossible to make it play a regular role. The current situation is that most regions still adopt a one-size-fits-all approach, absorbing propagandists to participate in the one-size-fits-all meetings of party members and Youth League members, which is not enough. Propagandists should receive special education: for propagandists, they should not only understand the general principles of various issues themselves, but also understand how to publicize these principles to the masses; they should not only understand how to publicize these principles to the masses, but also understand how to constantly improve their propaganda work according to the changes in the thinking of the masses. A one-size-fits-all meeting cannot replace the meeting of propagandists. What kind of system is appropriate to establish? We have not yet found a more complete experience, which requires us to create and accumulate in our future work. But we can propose some preliminary and practical measures based on past experience and lessons – various regions must seriously summarize the experience in this regard – and then constantly modify and supplement them in practice. For example, is it feasible for the factory party committee and the workshop branch to hold propagandist meetings or representative meetings once or twice a month, and the municipal party committee to hold propagandist representative meetings once every three months? In rural branches, is it feasible to hold a propagandist meeting once a month with the help of the county and district, a propagandist representative meeting once every three months by the district committee, and a propagandist representative meeting once every six months by the county committee? These do not need to be uniform, and can be stipulated according to the specific conditions of each region. In short, we must establish a system and strengthen management. In the past, some of our systems had too high requirements and were difficult to sustain, and we must also prevent this deviation from occurring.

Finally, we must pay attention to the development and use of propagandists. Since the responsibilities of propagandists are as important as mentioned above, we must carefully select propagandists. In the past, we had a tendency to set the conditions for propagandists too high, which is of course undesirable, but the main tendency now is to lower the conditions for propagandists and turn the party's propaganda network into a mass propaganda team, which must be noted. Propagandists must first be party members who can perform propaganda work, and then non-Party activists. In the development of propagandists, we must also gradually overcome the unbalanced state. For example, in a factory, some workshops have a large number of propagandists, while some workshops do not have a single one; as for the blank areas in the countryside, there are even more. We must fill these blank areas as party building progresses.

III

This year is the third year of the country's first five-year plan for planned construction. Whether we can do a good job this year is of decisive significance for completing the first five-year plan. From Shandong's perspective, how to continue to carry out the increase production and practice economy movement, strive to comprehensively and balancedly complete the industrial production plan, how to ensure the successful operation of the established and about-to-be-established large number of agricultural production cooperatives, lay a good foundation for future large-scale development, strive for continued bumper harvests in agricultural production, how to ensure the completion of various financial and economic work and cultural and educational work plans, and how to continue to implement the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, enhance party unity, and thoroughly change the party's leadership style are arduous and heavy tasks facing our entire party comrades and the entire people in 1955, and must be guaranteed to be completed. At the same time, due to the United States' unwillingness to be an enemy of the Chinese people and its signing of the so-called "common defense treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group, and implementing war provocations against our country, this requires us to be more united, vigilant, consolidate public security, and do a good job to support the People's Liberation Army's struggle to liberate Taiwan and completely smash the US-Chiang war treaty. In order to successfully complete these arduous and heavy tasks, in addition to strengthening our work in various aspects, we must also further strengthen the Party's propaganda work; conscientiously reorganize the propaganda network, and truly establish regular mass propaganda work.

    必须认真整理巩固宣传网，切实建立党对人民群众的经常宣传工作
    夏征农
    编者按：我们有些党组织忽视了巩固和发展党的宣传网工作，忽视了在各种工作中充分发挥宣传网的作用。这篇文章中所提出的问题，值得各地党组织注意。各地党组织应当根据中央“关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定”的精神，对党的宣传网普遍进行一次整理，这篇文章中所提出的整理宣传网的方法，可供各地党组织参考。这篇文章原载一月一日山东大众日报，本报转载时，曾略加删改。
    一
    一九五一年一月一日中共中央发布了“关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定”。根据这个决定，山东党组织，即在全省范围内开始了建立党的宣传网的工作，到一九五二年，发展了宣传员共四十五万余人，成为一支巨大的党的宣传队伍。这支党的宣传队伍，在抗美援朝、镇压反革命及其它各项政治运动中，在增产节约、民主改革、生产改革及其它各项经济建设工作中，都发挥了一定的作用。他们广泛地宣传了党的政策，提高了群众的觉悟，密切了党与群众的联系，推动了各项工作任务的胜利完成；同时也把党的宣传工作向前推进了一大步。在这一段时间内，不管干部和群众都认为宣传员是管用的。干部说：“有了宣传员，工作好做了，强迫命令也少了。”群众说：“有了宣传员，什么国家大事都能听到，心里亮堂多了。”这证明了：中央建立宣传网的决定，是完全正确的，是切实可行的，对于经常地有组织地向群众进行宣传，加强与密切党与群众的联系，改进党的领导作风，是有着建设性的意义的，因而也是为广大党员干部和人民群众所欢迎的。
    一九五三年初，根据中央指示，山东党组织在全省开展了反对官僚主义、反对分散主义的斗争，这是必要的。官僚主义与分散主义，是一种资产阶级思想作风的反映，任何时候，任何地方，只要有了官僚主义，有了分散主义，都必须反对。但在反官僚主义、反分散主义的斗争中，却发生了一些偏差与错误。把建立了两年的四十五万多宣传员也当成多余的了。有的地委负责同志曾公开在会议上宣称宣传网是造成农村忙乱的主要原因，是“五多”之一，要求把它取消；有的市委曾做出决定，要把工厂中的党员干部从宣传网中抽出来，认为这是减少党员干部忙乱的好办法，并进行了典型试验。个别负责同志还别开生面地提出“技术员就是宣传员”的主张，根据他们的主张，当然宣传员就可以不要了。这些言论和行动，虽然由于遭到了一般同志的反对，并没有做出统一的取消党的宣传网的明文规定，也没有能够在全省范围内畅行无阻地贯彻执行，但在大多数地区，党的宣传网是被“反掉”了的，或者被搁置一边变成有名无实的。经过这样的一年，大多数区乡干部，甚至县的负责干部，连宣传网是干什么的也忘记了。正由于这样，由于轻视宣传工作，由于取消了党的宣传网而不能经常地向群众宣传，党员干部的强迫命令作风发展了，农民群众的自发的资本主义倾向滋长了，党与群众的关系受到损害了，工作中的忙乱紧张状况反而更是增加了。这一切恶果，到了一九五三年冬在粮食统购统销工作中，便集中地暴露了出来。这证明了：宣传工作是不能丝毫忽视的，党的宣传网是不能取消的，党在工厂、农村中的政治工作，不是“多”了，而是少了，任何企图削弱党对群众的宣传工作的想法和做法，都是错误的。
    一九五四年，在各级党组织的领导机关内，广泛地进行了关于党的四中全会决议和第二次全国宣传工作会议文件的传达和学习，清算了过去的错误，因而也就使在全省范围内改进党的宣传工作有了充分的条件。
    一年以来，随着党的领导作风的逐步改善，山东党组织的宣传工作也是有着若干改进的。在去年夏季小麦的统购工作中，特别在秋征秋购工作中，各级党组织均反复地对党员群众进行了教育，并有很大一部分地区通过各项宣传工作整理了宣传网。如寿张县八十二个乡，就已经整理了七十余个乡的宣传网。在这样的一些地区，宣传员的作用发挥了，群众宣传工作比较深入地开展了，干部群众的认识也改变了。干部反映：“过去吃了不重视宣传网的亏，今年秋季不同了：人手多、嘴多，工作顺利，群众满意！”群众反映：“会少了，知道的事多了。”这次的统购工作，是比一九五三年冬的统购工作复杂得多的——不仅统购粮食，还要统购棉花、油料，同时，由于上次统购工作犯了错误，在群众中造成的不良影响，也增加了这次统购工作的困难。但这次统购工作，虽然还未完全结束，从前一段工作看来，却顺利得多，任务既完成得快，群众也比较满意；与上次统购工作比起来，情况大有天壤之别。原因何在呢？我们以为：普遍地重视了宣传工作，部分地发挥了党的宣传网的作用，不能不是重要原因之一。但是，必须指出：一年以来，宣传工作的改进是很不够的，特别是对于党的宣传网的作用的发挥是很不够的。有不少县区乡党组织的负责同志，对于党的宣传网还未予以重视，还存在着很多糊涂观点；有很大一部分地区的宣传网还没有开始进行整理，连谁是宣传员也没有摸清；有些县区乡的负责同志虽然重视了宣传网，但还不知如何管理与使用宣传网，以充分发挥其作用。因此，如何在全省范围内认真整理一次党的宣传网，充分发挥宣传员的作用，建立起经常的有组织的群众宣传工作，以进一步加强党与群众的关系，彻底克服强迫命令作风，推动各项工作的胜利进行，仍是今后各级党委特别是党委宣传部的一个重要任务。
    二
    要把党的宣传网整理好，以充分发挥其作用，到底存在着一些什么问题呢？怎样来解决这些问题呢？我们认为有如下的几个方面：
    首先，必须端正对于党的宣传网的认识。有些同志不重视党的宣传网，甚至认为可以取消，主要原因就是由于他们对于宣传网的认识存在着许多糊涂观点。他们说：“过去没有建立宣传网，不是一样工作吗？”“有了党、团员积极分子做宣传工作，为什么还要建立宣传网呢？不是找麻烦吗？”“让群众去当宣传员吧！何必要党员干部去担任呢？群众不是一样宣传吗？”这些说法显然是不正确的。向群众宣传，是我们党的优良传统之一，党员有做宣传工作的义务，早已载于党章，为什么党中央又要发布建立党的宣传网的决定呢？看这个决定上是怎么说的吧：“目前党对人民群众的宣传工作的主要弱点之一，就是各级党的组织往往把它当作一部分人的和临时性的工作，而没有建立必要的制度，使它成为全体共产党员的经常性的工作，并由各级党的委员会给以有系统的领导和管理。”“对人民群众的宣传工作缺乏经常性和组织性的现象，势必妨碍共产党员有效地履行自己的这种职责，放纵反革命分子的宣传活动和错误思想的流传，妨碍党与人民群众联系的加强，妨碍党的克服官僚主义命令主义倾向的斗争，而使一部分党员在人民群众中进行工作时容易醉心于以简单的行政命令方法而不是以说服解释方法来对待人民群众。党必须坚决消灭这种现象，加强对人民群众的宣传工作。为此目的，就必须有系统地建立对人民群众的经常性的宣传网……”这里告诉我们：第一，我们虽然过去做了许多宣传工作，但有很大的缺点，这就是缺乏经常性和组织性；第二，虽然共产党员都有宣传工作的职责，但由于宣传工作缺乏组织性，没有建立必要的制度，就妨碍着共产党员有效地履行自己的职责；第三，没有经常的有组织的群众宣传工作，就会放纵坏分子造谣活动，妨碍党与群众的联系，妨碍克服官僚主义命令主义的斗争。从这里我们就完全可以明白：宣传网是保证党能够经常地有组织地向人民群众进行宣传，保证党员能够有效地履行自己的职责的一种制度（不是一种组织），宣传员是党向人民群众进行宣传的核心力量，通过这个核心力量，来带动全党以及党的积极分子有组织地经常地向人民群众进行宣传工作。这样，宣传网怎么会是可有可无的呢？党员又怎么可以不担任宣传员呢？从今天来讲，各级党组织的领导同志完全忽视宣传工作的还是个别的，但对于建立经常的宣传工作的重要意义，却一般的认识不足。较普遍的是简单地把宣传工作当作完成某项具体工作任务的手段，因而任务来了就宣传，任务完了宣传工作也就完了。这样，也就很难认识建立宣传网的必要性。建立宣传网是与建立经常性的宣传工作互相关连的。这一点，在中央的建立宣传网的决定中也讲得很明白了。宣传工作是推动各项工作的动力，但宣传工作决不只是为了完成某项具体工作任务；它的作用主要的有：保证党的思想、政策、方针的正确传播，不断地提高人民群众的社会主义觉悟，鼓舞人民群众的劳动热情；批驳各种反动谣言及在人民群众中流传的错误思想；密切党与群众的联系，纠正党员的强迫命令作风等。正因为宣传工作有着这样多方面的重大的意义，所以必须经常的有组织的进行，必须建立党的宣传网来保证这方面的任务的实现。只有认识了建立经常性的群众宣传工作的重大意义，才能认识建立宣传网的必要性。最近中共中央山东分局宣传部为了引起各级党组织对于宣传网的重视，重新印发了中共中央“关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定”，希望全党同志再把这个文件好好学习一遍，以澄清尚留存的一些糊涂观点，切实地把党的宣传网管理起来。
    其次，必须改变宣传工作中的“大呼隆”一般化的工作作风。几年来，我们是做了许多宣传工作的，但直至现在为止，还只习惯于搞政治运动的一套，开大会，做大报告，大擂大轰，而缺乏深入细致的工作作风，于是也就不会感觉到有建立经常性的宣传网的必要。正由于习惯于甚至满足于这种
  “大呼隆”的一套，在有些干部中产生了这样的一种错觉，好像宣传工作就只要开会做报告，再来建立宣传网就觉得是自找麻烦了。真的，如果宣传工作只是开会做报告，那么，只要党委几个负责人就可以完全“包”下来，确实用不着什么宣传员，甚至连宣传部也可以不要了。但是，问题并不这样简单。群众宣传工作，不仅有如前面所说的那样重大的意义，而且就是要解决群众某一具体思想问题，或者向群众宣传某一具体工作任务，也决不是单靠一两次大报告能够达到目的的，一般的大报告的主要作用常常只能产生一种启发作用或者鼓舞作用，而要真正解决群众中各种不同的具体的思想问题，那就非有深入细致的说服解释工作不可。要进行深入细致的说服解释工作，也就不能单靠几个党委负责人，而必须依靠全党，特别是要依靠全党进行群众宣传工作的核心力量——宣传员。过去，在我们领导上，对于群众宣传工作经验的介绍，也常常是偏重于大擂大轰那一套的，今后，必须特别注意培养深入细致的宣传工作作风，更多地介绍深入细致的宣传工作经验，使各级党组织的领导能够从具体工作的体验中认识经常性的宣传网的重大作用；同时，又从建立经常性的宣传网的工作中把深入细致的工作作风培养起来。
    再其次，必须加强对宣传员的经常教育与管理，切实改正过去对于宣传员只是使用不加教育的作法。在过去，对于宣传员的教育，各地党委根据中央决定的精神，是曾经建立了一些制度的，如传授制度，宣传员会议或宣传员代表会议制度等。这些制度，不管其本身有何弱点，但对于提高宣传员的质量，发挥宣传员的力量，都起了不同程度的作用。随着一九五三年宣传网的被“反掉”，这些制度也就自然首先被“反掉”了。而现在，当我们开始重新整理宣传网的时候，也必须首先在工作中把一些必要的制度逐步建立起来，以加强对宣传员的经常性的教育和管理。没有经常的教育，是不可能使它发挥经常的作用的。目前的情况是：大多数地区，还是采取一揽子的办法，吸收宣传员参加党团员的一揽子会议，这样做是不够的。宣传员应该受到特殊的教育：对于宣传员，不仅要他自己懂得各个问题的一般道理，而且要他懂得如何给群众宣传这些道理；不仅要他懂得如何向群众宣传这些道理，而且要他懂得如何根据群众思想的变化随时改进自己的宣传工作。一揽子会议，是不能代替宣传员的会议的。到底要建立一些什么样的制度才合适呢？现在还找不到一套比较完整的经验，这需要我们在今后工作中来创造和积累。但我们可以根据过去的经验教训——各地必须认真总结一下这方面的经验——从实际出发，提出一些初步的切实易行的办法来，以后再在实行中来不断加以修改和补充。比如，在工厂党委与车间支部中，每月分别召开一次或二次宣传员会议或代表会议，市委每三个月召开一次宣传员代表会议，是否行得通？在农村支部中，在县区帮助下，每月召开一次宣传员会议，区委每三个月召开一次宣传员代表会议，县委每半年召开一次宣传员代表会议是否行得通？这些不必强求一致，可以根据各地具体情况来规定。总之，必须建立制度，加强管理。过去我们有些制度，要求过高，难以持久，还要防止发生这个偏向。
    最后，必须重视宣传员的发展和使用。宣传员的责任，既然如前面所说的那样重要，对于发展宣传员就必须慎重选择。过去，我们曾经有把宣传员的条件提得太高的偏向，这当然是要不得的，但现在主要的偏向，却是把宣传员的条件降低，使党的宣传网变为群众的宣传队伍，这一点必须注意。宣传员必须首先是可以担任宣传工作的党员，然后才是非党的积极分子。在发展宣传员中，还必须逐步克服不平衡的状态，比如一个工厂，有的车间宣传员数目很大，有的车间则一个没有；至于农村中的空白地区则更是不少。我们必须随着党的建设，把这些空白区填补起来。

    今年，是国家有计划建设的第一个五年计划的第三年。能否把今年工作搞好，对于完成第一个五年计划，带有决定性的意义。从山东来说，如何继续开展增产节约运动，争取全面地均衡地完成工业生产的计划，如何保证办好已经建立和即将建立起来的大批农业生产合作社，为今后大发展打好基础，争取农业生产继续丰收，如何保证完成各项财经工作与文教工作计划，以及如何继续贯彻党的七届四中全会决议，增强党的团结，彻底转变党的领导作风，这是一九五五年摆在我们全党同志与全体人民面前的艰巨而繁重的任务，必须保证完成。同时，由于美帝国主义者的甘心与中国人民为敌，与蒋介石卖国集团签订所谓“共同防御条约”，对我国实行战争挑衅，这就要求我们必须更加团结一致，提高警惕，巩固治安，做好工作，以支援人民解放军解放台湾的斗争，彻底粉碎美蒋的战争条约。为了胜利完成这些艰巨而繁重的任务，除了从各方面来加强我们的工作外，也必须进一步来加强党的宣传工作；认真整理好宣传网，切实建立起经常的群众宣传工作来。
