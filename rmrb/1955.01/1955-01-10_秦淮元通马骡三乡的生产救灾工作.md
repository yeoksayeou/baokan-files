    Production and Disaster Relief Work in Qinhuai, Yuantong, and Maluo Townships
    Liang Cong

    After Qinhuai and Yuantong townships in Jiangning County and Maluo township in Jiangpu County, Jiangsu Province, suffered from flooding last year, the thoughts and emotions of cadres and the masses were once chaotic, and they lacked confidence in overcoming the disaster. In order to change this situation, the Jiangning and Jiangpu County Party Committees and the local District Party Committee promptly educated the cadres and, through the cadres, the masses. Taking the Party branch as the core, they vigorously mobilized the masses to carry out production for self-relief through mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and achieved great results. In the process of production self-relief, the masses of Qinhuai Township actively added dikes and drained water, so that more than 400 mu of rice that might have been lost still yielded more than 135,000 jin of harvest; 135 mu of wasteland were reclaimed and late autumn crops were replanted, yielding more than 10,000 jin of miscellaneous grains; more than 200 mu of vegetables were planted, and more than 4,000 dan have already been harvested; the winter sowing area has reached more than 80%, and most of it has been carefully cultivated. Now no one in the township is starving or freezing. Maluo Township has developed sideline production such as fishing, cutting firewood, and transporting goods, with current income reaching over 240 million yuan. An agricultural production cooperative and forty mutual aid groups in Yuantong Township can solve the living expenses of 4,500 people for 45 days with their sideline income in twenty days.

    Through production and disaster relief work, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in these three townships has also been further consolidated and developed. For example, the Lanhua Agricultural Production Cooperative in Maluo Township had only sixteen households before the disaster, but now it has grown to sixty-eight households. Qinhuai Township originally had four agricultural production cooperatives, with 170 participating farm households. Now it has developed into six cooperatives with 421 participating farm households. At the same time, production and disaster relief work has also improved grassroots cadres and strengthened the ranks of the Party and the League. For example, fifty-one activists emerged in Qinhuai Township during the disaster relief work, of whom ten have joined the Communist Party of China and seventeen have joined the Communist Youth League.

    The main reason why the production and disaster relief work in these three townships has achieved good results is that the local Party organizations have grasped the work of ideological mobilization. All three townships have held Party and League branch meetings. At the meetings, by summarizing the work of the previous stage, the achievements of flood prevention and rescue were affirmed as due to the strong leadership of the Party and the efforts of the broad masses. Model figures in flood prevention and rescue were commended, and the existing problems in the current production and disaster relief work were identified. The impact of the success or failure of disaster relief work on national economic construction was specifically analyzed, so that every Party and League member clearly recognized that doing a good job in production and disaster relief work was their due responsibility. At the same time, they recognized that disaster relief work was an arduous but glorious political and economic task. The Party branches of the three townships have all determined to focus on leading the production and disaster relief work. After Party and League members had a correct understanding of the disaster relief work, the Party branches then studied the ideological problems of ordinary cadres and the masses, studied methods to overcome the disaster, and formulated a work plan for production and disaster relief in their respective townships based on local conditions. The production and disaster relief plan was discussed and revised by the township People's Congress and adopted as a formal resolution of the congress. The three townships also convened township People's Government committees, meetings of key members of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, mass meetings, etc., to convey and implement the resolutions. While implementing the resolutions, the educational methods of recalling past experiences and making comparisons, and calculating detailed accounts were adopted among the masses to inspire them to recall and compare the living conditions of the people after the 1931 flood and after last year's flood, and to calculate the difficulties of individual farmers after the disaster and the benefits of being organized. Through comparison and detailed calculation, the masses finally concluded that: after the disaster in 1931, they were helpless and had to sell their children and run around, but now, under the leadership of the Communist Party, every family is reunited and carries out production for self-relief; in the past, prices fluctuated, rising three times a day, but now prices are stable and the government guarantees supply; in the past, individual households worked alone, with many difficulties and few solutions, but now they are organized with great strength and many solutions. Through this kind of recollection and comparison, the masses became more confident in production for self-relief.

    The production and disaster relief work in these three townships was carried out from points to the whole area, that is, first doing a good job in production and self-relief within a mutual aid group or a production cooperative, and then immediately convening various meetings to spread experience, organize visits, organize and support the production that the masses have already started, and take the group and the cooperative as the core to drive the broad masses of farmers to participate in the production and self-relief movement. At the same time, the government provides necessary relief to those who have no labor force or who, although they have a labor force, are still unable to solve the difficulties in production and life.

    After the production and self-relief activities were launched, these three townships frequently conducted inspections, continuously educated the disaster victims, specifically helped them solve the difficulties in production and self-relief, and gradually established a working system to guide the production of disaster victims according to needs. For example, in order to ensure the gradual deepening of the movement, the Party branch of Qinhuai Township stipulated that meetings should be held on time, and the Party members assigned to each village should report on the progress of production and disaster relief work, and study and solve the difficulties existing among the masses. This not only strengthened the sense of responsibility of Party members and cadres, but also directly played a role in inspecting and supervising the disaster relief work.

    秦淮元通马骡三乡的生产救灾工作
    梁琮
    江苏省江宁县秦淮、元通两个乡和江浦县马骡乡去年遭受水灾以后，干部和群众的思想情绪曾经一度混乱，对战胜灾荒缺乏信心。中共江宁、江浦县委和当地区委为了改变这种状况，及时向干部并通过干部向群众进行了教育，并以党支部为核心，通过互助合作组织，大力发动群众开展了生产自救活动，取得了很大成绩。秦淮乡群众在生产自救中，由于积极加埂排涝，使四百余亩可能失收的水稻仍获得十三万五千多斤的收成；开荒一百三十五亩补种了晚秋，计收杂粮一万多斤；种菜二百余亩，已收四千余担；冬播面积已达百分之八十以上，且多数做到精耕细作。现在全乡没有一人挨饿受冻。马骡乡开展了捕鱼、砍柴、搬运等副业生产，现已收入达两亿四千多万元。元通乡一个农业生产合作社和四十个互助组，在二十天时间内的副业收入即可解决四千五百人四十五天的生活。
    通过生产救灾工作，这三个乡的互助合作运动也得到进一步的巩固和发展。如马骡乡兰花农业生产合作社在遭灾前只有十六户，现在已经发展到六十八户。秦淮乡原有四个农业生产合作社，参加农户原有一百七十户，现在已经发展到六个社，参加的农户达到四百二十一户。同时，通过生产救灾工作也提高了基层干部，壮大了党团队伍。如秦淮乡在救灾工作中涌现出五十一名积极分子，其中已有十人参加了中国共产党，十七人参加了青年团。
    这三个乡的生产救灾工作所以获得较好成绩，最主要的是当地党的组织抓紧了思想发动的工作。这三个乡都曾召开党、团支部大会。在会上，通过总结前一阶段的工作，肯定了防汛抢险的成绩是由于党的坚强领导和广大群众的努力，表扬了防汛抢险中的模范人物，找出了目前生产救灾工作中存在的问题，具体分析了救灾工作做的好坏对国家经济建设的影响，使每个党、团员明确认识到做好生产救灾工作是自己应尽的责任，同时认识到救灾工作是一项艰巨的但又是光荣的政治任务和经济任务。三个乡的党支部都确定以领导作好生产救灾工作为中心。党、团员对救灾工作有了正确认识之后，党的支部接着研究了一般干部和群众的思想问题，研究了战胜灾荒的办法，并根据本地情况，拟出了本乡生产救灾的工作计划。生产救灾计划经过乡人民代表大会讨论修正，作为大会正式决议。三个乡又都分别召开了乡人民政府委员会、互助合作组织中骨干分子会，群众会等，传达贯彻决议。在贯彻决议同时，在群众中采用了回忆对比，算细账的教育方法，启发群众回忆对比一九三一年的水灾以后和去年水灾以后人民生活情况，算一算单干农民在受灾后的困难和组织起来的好处。通过对比、算细账，群众最后得出的结论是：一九三一年灾后无依无靠，只好卖儿卖女，东奔西跑，现在有共产党领导，家家团圆，生产自救；以前是物价波动，一天三涨，现在是物价稳定，政府保证供应；以前是一家一户单干，困难多，办法少，现在是组织起来力量大，办法多。通过这种回忆对比，群众对生产自救更加充满信心。
    这三个乡的生产救灾工作是从点到面开展起来的，也就是先在一个互助组或一个生产合作社内搞好生产自救工作，然后立即召开各种会议，传播经验，组织参观，把群众已活动起来的生产加以组织和扶持，以组、社为核心，带动广大农民投入生产自救运动。同时，对无劳动力或虽有劳动力但仍不能解决生产生活困难的，由政府进行必要的救济。
    生产自救活动开展起来以后，这三个乡都经常进行检查，不断地对灾民进行教育，具体帮助灾民解决生产自救中的困难，并根据需要逐步建立起指导灾民生产的工作制度。如秦淮乡为了保证运动的逐步深入，党支部规定按时召开会议，由分工到各村的党员汇报生产救灾工作情况，研究解决群众中存在的困难问题。这样不但加强了党员干部的责任心，而且对救灾工作直接起了检查督促的作用。
