Doing a Good Job of Distribution Summary is a Key to Consolidating Agricultural Cooperatives
    ——The Experience of "Spark" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xishui County in Conducting Ideological Education Through Distribution Summary
    Dong Mingxue
    In its distribution work in 1954, the "Spark" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wangcheng Township, Xishui County, Hubei Province, basically implemented the policy of "distribution according to labor being the primary factor, while also considering land" and "more pay for more work in the labor income portion." Ninety-two percent of the cooperative members increased their actual income by 6 to 61 percent (23 out of 25 households in the cooperative increased their income). After the distribution, the long-standing question in the minds of the members, "Can we increase our income?" was resolved; the members who previously showed emotional instability have now stabilized, and the members who were previously relatively stable in their thinking are now even more resolute.
    The stability of the members' thinking does not necessarily mean that their socialist consciousness has been greatly enhanced. Although the members have benefited from the cooperative, they do not necessarily consciously understand where the benefits come from. They have various views on the issue of increasing production and increasing income. In terms of increased production, some believe that the reason for this year's increase is the improvement of technology and the acceptance of advanced experience; some say it is because "the members worked hard," and some say it is because "more fertilizer was applied." But what is the main reason? No one can say for sure. In terms of increased income, most people only think that the reason for increased income is more labor. In fact, some of the preliminary technological reforms currently implemented in the cooperative can also be implemented in mutual aid teams; mutual aid teams and individual farmers can also "work hard" and "do more labor." But why can't they increase production or not increase production as much as the cooperative? Obviously, it is not enough to simply understand the reasons for increasing production and increasing income in this way.
    Of course, improving technology and doing more labor are important reasons for increasing production and increasing income; however, it should be further understood that the most fundamental reason is that the cooperative has the superiority of unified management. Without this, many things would be difficult to do if it were decentralized management. After the cooperative unified management, production underwent many changes: (1) distant fields became near fields, increasing production by 69.15 piculs; (2) small plots became large plots, and scattered fields became consolidated fields, totaling 38 plots; (3) distant water became near water, and reverse water became smooth water in six places; (4) in the past, "night work fields" and "hope-for-rain slopes" could not be planted with rice seedlings, but now, with the unified use of water conservancy, they can also be planted; (5) the private dirt roads of the past were difficult for others to walk, but now it is convenient to go to the fields; (6) with the unified use of labor, everyone has something to do, and sideline production has increased, increasing income by more than 20 million yuan; (7) in the past, several crops had to be planted in one plot of land, but now crops can be planted according to the land; (8) in the past, one person had to do everything, putting down this and picking up that, which not only wasted time but also made it difficult to master technology, but now labor is divided according to strengths, and each person does one line of work. All these benefits are only available to cooperatives, not to mutual aid teams, let alone individual farmers. Like these superior conditions, not every member systematically understands them.
    Without fundamentally recognizing the benefits of the cooperative, blind enthusiasm cannot last. Moreover, a small number of members have less increased income, and some members are still influenced by rich peasant ideas, do not want to engage in agricultural labor, but want to get rich through "various means." Middle peasants Gan Yaokun and Zhu Guozhi said: "One year in the cooperative, this little increase in production is too little!" In fact, if they had not joined the cooperative this year, they would have been in danger of becoming impoverished or even bankrupt due to disasters. Gan Yaokun was sick for three months this year, spending more than one million yuan; one person died in his family, spending more than 300,000 yuan; one pig died, losing more than 200,000 yuan; and a flood inundated four piculs of his fields, resulting in no harvest. In a situation like 1954, if he had not joined the cooperative, he would only have earned 600,000 yuan. His income in the cooperative this year was 2.7 million yuan, three and a half times more than if he had not joined the cooperative! After calculating this account, many people were moved and said: If Gan Yaokun had not joined the cooperative, he would have been poor in one year! He is "unaware of his good fortune." But he himself is still not satisfied (because his income was 2.8 million yuan the year before), and after the distribution, he still said that the cooperative did not take care of him, had many opinions, and did not attend meetings. What does Gan Yaokun's example illustrate? It seems that some people do not become actively embark on the new road simply because they have increased production and increased income; more importantly, they must further understand the fundamental reasons for increasing production and increasing income. Therefore, in the distribution work, a systematic and concrete socialist education and collectivist education should be conducted for the members. There is lively and rich content in conducting these educational works in the distribution work.
    After the distribution, the members demanded to calculate the income comparison account to see how much income had actually increased. As soon as the distribution accounts were announced, the members automatically started family meetings to calculate the accounts. Members Gan Qigui, Yuan Cunfu, and others often calculated until late at night. Everyone reflected: "As soon as the distribution accounts are announced, every household has to light two more lamps." Since calculating the "income comparison account" has become a demand of the masses, it should be actively led. Without leadership, the accounts can easily be calculated incorrectly. For example, Li Yaoqing originally increased his income by more than 300,000 yuan; however, according to his own calculation, he did not include the income of his private plot of land, 450,000 yuan, so he calculated that his income had decreased by 150,000 yuan. As a result, he blindly shouted that "income has decreased." Some people compared the income of one season in 1954 with the income of one year in 1953, compared the net income after joining the cooperative with the total income before joining the cooperative, and some even deliberately said that the income before joining the cooperative was very high. If it is not led and everyone is not helped to clarify the facts, bad effects will occur. However, leadership is by no means a matter of taking over everything. Like the third group, because the cadres took over everything, they did not make good use of the method of typical demonstration, but rigidly forced the members to calculate, and forced the members to "praise," which led to a stalemate and aroused the dissatisfaction of the members.
    From the perspective of the development law of the masses' thinking, it is right to start from calculating the "income comparison account." However, the calculation of the account itself can only play a role in stabilizing emotions and clarifying the mind, and cannot fundamentally solve the problem. Some members increased their income, thought that the difficulties in life had been resolved, or thought that they had the capital for personal "free development," and even wanted to withdraw from the cooperative and work individually. To truly solve the problem, it is necessary to continue to deepen and improve, and further solve the problem of the members who are still hesitating, "whether to turn back to the old road or continue to take the new road." On the basis of calculating the "income comparison account" well, the "Spark" cooperative first enlightened everyone to look at the whole cooperative, and then guided everyone to look at the individual. Looking at the whole cooperative is mainly to start from summarizing the experience of increasing production, especially focusing on summarizing the various changes in production caused by the unified management of land, to see whether the cooperative is superior or not, how much of these advantages the mutual aid team has, and whether the individual farmers have them. After such a summary, everyone clearly said: Without the unified management and collective labor of the cooperative, first, the "interplanting" of wheat fields cannot be fully realized; second, 50-picul lake fields cannot be planted; third, weeds cannot be removed on rainy days, and cotton in "buried weed graves" cannot achieve a bumper harvest of more than 120 catties per mu (more than twice that of the mutual aid team); fourth, it is even more difficult to plant late autumn crops on 100% of the cultivated land; fifth, sideline production cannot earn more than 20 million yuan. These few items alone would increase income by more than 35,000 catties of grain, an average increase of 1,400 catties per household, which can顶两个半人一年的口粮. In this way, members can be educated to further realize that: first there is the big benefit of the whole cooperative, and then there is the small benefit of the individual.
    In order to make the ideological education work more profound, and in order to thoroughly solve the ideological problems of the members who have less increased production, the members were enlightened to conduct a period of recall and comparison, so that everyone can see: what was the situation of production and life before joining the cooperative, and what is it like after joining the cooperative? What would happen if you didn't join the cooperative? What is the situation of those who joined the cooperative, and what is the situation of those who did not join the cooperative? Regarding these questions, the conclusion of everyone is: "Whoever joins the cooperative first will rise faster and live a better life; on the contrary, they will rise slower, and even decline in the event of disasters and accidents." This conclusion is based on facts. First of all, looking at the inside of the cooperative, out of the 25 households in the whole cooperative, 5 households suffered from floods, 2 households had deaths, and 3 households suffered from serious illnesses (the longest was four months, the shortest was one month, and all of them were ill during the seasons of crop shortages and the busiest times of transplanting and harvesting). For these households, without the mutual support of the cooperative, and the support of the supply and marketing cooperative and the credit cooperative, they would all become impoverished due to disasters, and even go bankrupt. After joining the cooperative, not only did they avoid this danger, but their income also greatly increased. Furthermore, there are 5 households in the whole cooperative who are old, have weak labor, and are semi-skilled. In the past, they could not do anything in production at all. Now, in the cooperative, they also get the benefit of "tailor-made" and have appropriate work to do, which not only eliminates the pain of being unable to do the work, but also increases income. Gan Qigui, who is old and sick, said: "I used to grind to death planting some fields, and I had to rest several times to carry water; after joining the cooperative, everyone took care of my health, I didn't carry a load, and my half-year income is more than twice my income in the past year." He was moved to tears in the recall and comparison. Even those with good production conditions have benefited a lot. If middle peasant Gan Qishou had not joined the cooperative last year, 19.5 piculs of the 28 piculs of fields in his family would have been planted in vain (without base fertilizer), and his income would have been greatly reduced; after joining the cooperative, his income increased by 14% compared with the year before. Secondly, from the outside of the cooperative, the superiority of the cooperative is also very obvious. Not to mention the poor peasants with poor production conditions, let's talk about the middle peasants with good production conditions. In the 26th electoral district of Wangcheng Township, there are five middle peasants surnamed Hu. In recent years, because they were afraid of suffering losses, had many concerns, and thought that their production conditions were good, they did not participate in mutual aid and cooperation; now their economic situation is not as good as any poor peasant in the cooperative. The cooperative produces 1.2 piculs of rice from 1 picul of fields, while they produce 8斗 from 1 picul of fields, or even lower. The cooperative harvests more than 100 catties of cotton per mu, while they only harvest more than 20 catties per mu. The lake fields of the cooperative were flooded once, and then planted again, striving for a bumper harvest; their fields were flooded, and they had neither manpower nor seeds, so they could only "sigh at the ocean." During the winter sowing, the cooperative finished planting wheat, and they still had some land that had not been turned over. In the unified grain purchase in 1954, the cooperative sold an average of more than 1,000 catties of surplus grain per household, while these five households did not sell a single catty and demanded that the government supply them with 1,550 catties.
    After such a comparison, the members loved their cooperative even more, and felt even more fearful of the future of the small-scale peasant economy. In the past, some people thought that "the old road is impassable" because "the government does not allow it"; now they understand that it is not because "the government does not allow it," but because it is really impassable.
    Then, two more questions were raised for everyone to discuss: 1. What is currently hindering the further development of our production? 2. What will we rely on to further increase production in the future? At the beginning of the discussion, the members' answers to the first question were: what hinders production are conservative ideas, insurmountable natural disasters, the harm of individualistic thinking that does not cherish collective interests to production, and the erosion of members' thinking by capitalist ideas that want to get rich by exploitation. The answers to the second question, some said to rely on the leadership of the Communist Party, and some said to rely on industrialization, were also not comprehensive and profound enough. This is because the questions raised by the leadership were too general and did not relate to the actual situation. Later, after concretely summarizing how rice and cotton increased production? In addition to the advanced experience such as more base fertilizer and close planting, what else is there? As soon as this was mentioned, everyone rushed to talk about it. Some said: Rice production increases because the barren fields are fertilized with a lot of ammonium sulfate, and the fertile fields are fertilized with gypsum, and cotton production increases mainly because there are "666" and sprayers to control insects. Where did ammonium sulfate, gypsum, and insecticides come from? They came from factories. Who transported them? The supply and marketing cooperative. Where did the money come from? It was borrowed from banks and credit cooperatives, and obtained from selling grain and cotton. These facts showed the members: Since the increase in production is because of the material help received, then in the future, we should strive for more help in these areas, and in the future, we should also strive for the help of agricultural mechanization. Therefore, it is necessary to actively run agricultural cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, and credit cooperatives well, produce more grain, produce more cotton, and support the country's economic construction.
    After this summary, the members unanimously reflected: If we peasants want to be truly rich and completely get rid of poverty, there is no second road to take other than running the cooperative well. In the past, when the weather was cold, people generally did not go to the fields in the morning. After the summary, every family got up before dawn and ran 15 miles away to cut a load of firewood, came back to eat, and then went to work in the cooperative.

    做好分配总结是巩固农业社的一个关键
    ——浠水县“星星”农业生产合作社通过分配总结进行思想教育的经验
    董明学
    湖北省浠水县望城乡“星星”农业生产合作社在一九五四年的分配工作中，基本贯彻了“以劳分配为主、兼顾土地”和“劳动收入部分多劳多得”的政策，百分之九十二的社员，增加了百分之六到百分之六十一的实际收入（全社二十五户有二十三户增加了收入）。分配以后，社员思想上长期存在的“能不能增加收入”的问题解决了；原来表现出情绪不稳定的社员，现在稳定下来了，原来思想比较稳定的社员，现在更加坚决了。
    社员思想的稳定，并不一定表示社会主义觉悟大大提高了。社员虽说得到了合作社的好处，但是并不一定就很自觉地懂得了好处是从哪里来的。他们对于增加生产、增加收入的问题，有多种多样的看法。从增产来说，有的认为今年增产的原因是改进技术好、接受先进经验好；有的说是“社员们卖力干”，有的说是“肥料下得多”。到底什么是主要的呢？谁也说不清楚。从增加收入来说，一般人只认为增加收入的原因是劳动得多。实际上，现在社里实行的一些初步的技术改革，互助组也是可以实行的；互助组和单干户也可以“卖力干”“多劳动”。但他们为什么不能增产或没有合作社增产多呢？显然，仅仅这样去理解增加生产和增加收入的原因是很不够的。
    当然，改进技术、多劳动是增加生产增加收入的重要原因之一；可是，应当进一步了解：最根本的原因还是合作社有统一经营的优越性。没有这一条，如果是分散经营，许多事是很难办到的。合作社统一经营以后，生产上就起了多方面的变化；（一）远田变近田六九点一五石；（二）小块变大块、零田变整田三十八丘；（三）远水变近水、倒水变顺水六处；（四）过去“夜干田”“望天丘”不能插秧，现在随着水利的统一使用也能插秧了；（五）过去的私有泥路别人不好走，现在下田方便了；（六）随着劳力统一使用，人人都有事做，并且增加了副业生产，增加收入两千多万元；（七）过去一丘田要种几样庄稼，现在能因田种植了；
  （八）过去一人百当，放下这个拿起那个，既耽误时间，技术又不易熟练，现在是按长处分工，各来一行。所有这些好处，只有合作社有，互助组就不能有，单干户更不必说。像这些优越条件，社员并不是个个都系统地了解到的。
    不从根本上认识社的好处，盲目的热情是不能持久的。况且，还有少数社员增加收入较少，有些社员还受着富农思想影响，不想从事农业劳动，而想“七门八路”发财。中农甘耀坤、朱国之等就说：“入社一年，增这点产，太少了！”其实，如果他们这一年不入社，就有因灾致贫以至破产的危险。甘耀坤一年病了三个月，用了一百多万元；家中死了一个人，用三十多万元；死一个猪，丢二十多万元；大水淹了四石田，无收成。像一九五四年这个处境，他如果不入社，只能收入六十万元。他这一年在社内的收益却合二百七十万元，比不入社要多三倍半！把这个账一算，许多人都很感动地说：甘耀坤要是不入社，一年就穷了！他是“人在福中不知福”。但他本人还不满足（因他前年收入二百八十万元），分配后，还说社没照顾他，意见很多，开会也不到。甘耀坤这个例子说明了什么问题呢？看来，有些人并不因为增加了生产增加了收入就可以积极走上新道路；更重要的是，还必须使他们进一步了解增加生产、增加收入的根本原因。因此，在分配工作中，应当系统地、具体地向社员进行一次社会主义教育和集体主义教育。在分配工作中进行这些教育工作，是有生动而丰富的内容的。
    在分配后，社员是要求算一算收入对比账，看看到底增加了多少收入。分配账目一公布，社员都自动开起家庭会算起账来。社员甘启贵、袁存富等人每每算到夜静更深。大家反映：“分配账目一公布，家家都要多点两盏灯油。”既然算“收入对比账”成了群众的要求，就应当主动加以领导。不领导，账就容易算错。如李耀青，本来增加收入三十多万元；可是，照他自己的算法，没有把自留田地的收入四十五万元计算在内，就算成了比过去减少收入十五万元。于是，他就盲目喊叫“收入减少”。还有人把一九五四年一季的收入比一九五三年一年的收入，把入社后的纯收入比入社前的总收入，甚至有人把入社前的收入故意说的高高的。如果不加以领导，不帮助大家把事实弄清楚，将会发生不好的效果。但是，领导决不是包办。像第三组，由于干部包办，没有很好地运用典型示范的方法，而是硬性强制社员算，硬要社员“叫好”，弄成了僵局，引起社员不满。
    从群众思想的发展规律来看，从算“收入对比账”入手是对的。但是，算账这件事本身只能起安定情绪、清醒头脑的作用，并不能从根本上解决问题。有的社员收入增加了，认为生活上的困难解决了，或者以为有了个人“自由发展”的资本了，竟想退社单干。要真正解决问题，还要继续深入、提高，进一步解决社员尚在犹豫的“到底回头走旧道路还是继续走新道路”的问题。“星星”社在算好“收入对比账”的基础上，第一步启发大家看看全社，第二步又引导大家看看个人。看看全社，主要是从总结增产经验入手，特别着重总结随着土地统一经营在生产上引起的各方面的变化，看合作社到底优越不优越，这些优越性互助组有多少，单干农民有没有。经过这样一总结，大家都很明白地说：要是没有合作社的统一经营和集体劳动，第一，小麦田“掇秧”不能全部做到；第二，五十石湖田种不成；第三，雨天不能除草，“埋草坟”的棉花也得不到每亩一百二十多斤的丰收（超过互助组两倍）；第四，百分之百的耕地种上了晚秋作物更难办到；第五，副业也不能挣两千多万元。仅这几项，大约要多收入三万五千多斤粮食，平均每户增加一千四百斤，可以顶两个半人一年的口粮。这样，就能教育社员进一步认识到：先有全社的大利益，才有个人的小利益。
    为了使思想教育工作进行得更深刻一些，为了彻底解决增产较少的社员的思想问题，又启发社员进行了一段回忆对比，使大家看看：入社前生产和生活方面的情况是怎样的，入社后是怎样的？假若不入社又会怎样？入了社的人是怎样，没入社的人是怎样？关于这些问题，大家的结论是：“谁先入社谁就上升得快，日子过得更好；相反，就上升得慢，遇了灾害意外甚至会下降。”这个结论是有事实根据的。首先从社内看，全社二十五户，就有五户遭水灾，两户死人，三户害重病（长者四个月，短者一个月，并且都是病在青黄不接和插秧割谷最忙的时节）。像这些户，如果没有合作社的同舟共济，和供销社、信用社的支持，都要因灾致贫，以至走向破产的道路。入了社，不但避免了这个危险，而且收入还大有增加。再说，全社还有五户年老、劳力弱、半生手，过去在生产上根本不能成行，现在在社里也得到“量体裁衣”的好处，有了适当的工作做，不仅免除了干不了的痛苦，并且增加了收入。年老有病的甘启贵说：“我往年种点田磨死了，挑担吃水要歇几气；入社后，大家照顾我的身体，一回担子没挑，半年的收入比过去一年的收入还多一倍。”他在回忆对比中感动得满眶热泪。就是生产条件好的人，也得了不少好处。中农甘启寿，去年要是不入社，全家二十八石田就有十九点五石田白插（没有底肥），收入将要大大减少；入了社，比前年还增加收入百分之十四。其次从社外来看，合作社的优越性也很明显。不说生产条件差的贫农，就说生产条件好的中农吧。望城乡第二十六选区有五户姓胡的中农，几年来由于怕吃亏，顾虑多，认为自己生产条件好，不参加互助合作；现在他们的经济情况已经不如合作社里任何一户贫农了。合作社一石田打一石二谷子，他们一石田打八斗，甚至还要低。合作社一亩地摘一百多斤棉花，他们一亩地只二十多斤。合作社的湖田淹了一道，又插了一道，争取了丰收；他们的田淹了，既没有人力，又没有种籽，只好“望洋兴叹”。冬播时，合作社的麦子种完了，他们还有些地没有翻转来。一九五四年粮食统购中，社内平均每户卖一千多斤余粮，而这五户却一斤没卖，还要求政府供应他们一千五百五十斤。
    经过这样一比，社员对自己的合作社更加热爱了，对小农经济的前途更感到畏惧了。以前，有些人认为“旧道路走不通”是“政府不叫走”；现在明白了并不是“政府不叫走”，而是实在走不通。
    接着，又提出两个问题让大家进行讨论：一、当前阻碍我们生产进一步发展的是什么？二、今后进一步提高生产靠什么？开始讨论时，社员对前一个问题的答复是：阻碍生产的，一是保守思想，二是不可战胜的天灾，不爱护集体利益的个人主义思想对生产的害处，和想靠剥削发财的资本主义思想对社员思想的侵蚀。对后一个问题的答复，有的说靠共产党领导，有的说靠工业化，也不够全面深刻。这是因为领导方面提出的问题太笼统了，没有联系到实际。后来，经过具体地总结水稻、棉花是怎样增产的？除了底肥下的多和密植等先进经验外，还有什么？这样一提，大家都争着谈起来了。有的说：水稻增产，瘦田是硫酸錏打的多，肥田是石膏打得好，棉花增产主要是因为有“六六六”、喷雾器把虫治住了。硫酸錏，石膏，虫药械等等从那里来的呢？工厂出的。谁运来的？供销社。那里来的钱？从银行、信用社借的，卖粮卖棉得到的。这些事实向社员说明了：增产既然是因为得到了这些物质上的帮助，那么今后就应该争取这些方面更多的帮助，将来还要争取农业机械化的帮助。因此，就必须积极办好农业社、供销社和信用社，多打粮食，多产棉花，支援国家经济建设。
    经过这次总结，社员一致反映：我们农民要想真正富裕，彻底摆脱贫困，除了办好合作社，再没有第二条道路可走。过去，天气冷的时候，早上一般不下田，总结后，家家起五更跑到十五里路外的地方，割一担柴回来吃完饭又去干社里的活。
