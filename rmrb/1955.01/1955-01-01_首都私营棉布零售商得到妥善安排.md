After the state implemented the planned supply of cotton cloth, 142 private cotton cloth retail stores and 324 cotton cloth vendors in Beijing established distribution relationships with the state-owned China National Textiles Import and Export Corporation under the leadership of the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce. Their business has improved compared to before, and they can generally maintain a certain turnover.

The original private retail commercial network in Beijing was very irrationally distributed. In some areas, due to the excessive concentration of outlets, many cotton cloth merchants could not maintain a certain turnover. The Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce adopted the method of assisting relocation to solve this problem. For example, Dongxiaoshi was an area with a high concentration of cotton cloth vendors. The Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce helped six vendors relocate to Dongsi People's Market, Huashi, and Hongqiao for business. After the relocation, the turnover of these vendors increased, and they were able to make a living. Some cotton cloth retail stores had difficulty maintaining a living due to small capital, incomplete cotton cloth patterns, and large expenses. Therefore, they voluntarily consulted with each other and merged with the approval of the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce. Now, six households, including Jianzhong, Jianhua, Ruifuxiang, Lifuxiang, Yiji, and Hengxingxiang, have been merged into three households. Five more households are currently in consultation. After the merger, the business situation has improved due to the relatively abundant capital and relatively complete varieties of cotton cloth. In October last year, the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce inspected the distribution situation of retailers and increased the distribution quantity for 145 cotton cloth distribution stores and vendors. In November, the distribution quantity was appropriately increased again, so that distributors could maintain a certain turnover.

Many private cotton cloth retail stores have improved labor-management consultation meetings after establishing distribution relationships with the state-owned China National Textiles Import and Export Corporation, and studied issues of improving business and management. Twenty-three cotton cloth retail stores, including Ruifuxiang, Qianxiangyi, and Hengxingxiang, eliminated unreasonable expenses after consultation between labor and management, which played a significant role in improving business.

    首都私营棉布零售商得到妥善安排
    国家实行棉布计划供应后，北京市一百四十二户私营棉布零售商店和三百二十四户棉布摊商，在市工商局领导下和国营花纱布公司建立了经销关系，营业较前好转，一般都能维持一定的营业额。
    北京市原有的私营零售商业网，分布极不合理。有些地区由于设点太集中，许多棉布商不能维持一定的营业额，市工商局就采取帮助迁移的办法来解决。如东晓市是棉布摊商较集中的地区，市工商局就帮助六户摊商迁移到东四人民市场、花市、红桥等三处营业。这些摊商在迁移后营业额有了增加，能维持生活。有些棉布零售商店因资金少、棉布花色不全，开支较大，难于维持生活，就在自愿的原则下互相协商，并经市工商局批准后进行合并。现在已有建中、建华，瑞丰祥、丽丰祥，益记、恒兴祥等六户并成三户。还有五户正在协商中。并店后因资金较充裕，棉布花色品种比较齐全，经营情况有好转。去年十月间，市工商局检查了零售商的经销情况，对一百四十五户棉布经销商店和摊商增加了经销数量；十一月又适当地增加了经销数量，使经销商能维持一定的营业额。
    许多私营棉布零售商店在和国营花纱布公司建立经销关系后，健全了劳资协商会议，研究了改进业务和经营管理的问题。瑞蚨祥、谦祥益、恒兴祥等二十三户棉布零售商店，经劳资双方协商后，取消了不合理的开支，对改进业务起了很大作用。
