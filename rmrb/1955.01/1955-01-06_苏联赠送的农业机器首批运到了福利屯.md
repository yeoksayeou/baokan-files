[Dispatch from our newspaper in Fulitun, Heilongjiang Province, on the 5th] The first batch of agricultural machinery, including tractors and automobiles, gifted by the Soviet government to our country for the establishment of large-scale grain farms, arrived here early in the morning of the 4th. They have now been parked in an enclosure of 50,000 square meters specially set up by the staff of the State-owned Friendship Farm.

These agricultural machines and equipment that have already arrived are brand-new products from 1954 from the famous Soviet Kirov Tractor Factory, Stalin Automobile Factory, Red Proletarian Factory, and Altai Agricultural Implement and Machine Manufacturing Factory. They include nine Stalin-80 tractors, four ZIS-585 trucks, six single-axle trailers, twelve powered five-bottom plows, four powered wide-swath harrows, two power lathes, twelve boxes of circular knife plows and tractor parts, etc.

The arrival of this batch of machinery greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the builders of the State-owned Friendship Farm. Comrade Wang Caoli, the director of the State-owned Friendship Farm, said: The day we have been waiting for for a long time has finally arrived. From these brand-new machines, we see the incomparably deep friendship of the Soviet people towards our country. We cannot but thank the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the government for the help they have given us on behalf of the Soviet people. Young tractor driver Jiang Xingya said that we must protect these tractors given to us by the Soviet government like the pupils of our eyes, ensure that we use them well, and humbly learn from Soviet experts to improve our farm construction.

    苏联赠送的农业机器首批运到了福利屯
    【本报黑龙江省福利屯五日电】苏联政府赠给我国为建立大型谷物农场所需的拖拉机和汽车等农业机器，首批已在四日清晨运到了这里。现在，它们已被停放在国营友谊农场职工们特为设置的一个五万平方公尺的围场内。
    已经运到这里的这些农业机器和设备，是苏联著名的基洛夫拖拉机工厂、斯大林汽车工厂、红色无产者工厂和阿尔泰农具机器制造厂一九五四年的崭新产品，它包括斯大林八十号拖拉机九架，吉斯五八五式载重汽车四辆，单轴拖车六辆，机力五铧犁十二部，机力宽幅耙四部，动力车床二台，圆刀犁和拖拉机零件等各十二箱。
    这批机器的到达，大大地鼓舞了国营友谊农场建设者们的热情。国营友谊农场场长王操犁同志说：我们盼望很久的这一天终于来到了，从这些崭新的机器上，使我们看到了苏联人民对我国无比深厚的友谊。我们不能不感谢苏联共产党和政府代表苏联人民对我们所作的帮助。青年拖拉机手姜兴亚说，苏联政府送给我们的这些拖拉机，我们一定要像爱护自己的眼珠一样来保护它，保证好好地使用它，并虚心向苏联专家学习，来搞好我们的农场建设。
