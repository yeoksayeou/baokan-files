Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 31st: The Vietnamese News Agency reported that the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on December 31st, protesting the obstruction of Korean reunification by American imperialists. The full text of the statement is as follows:

"At the meeting of the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly held in early December this year, the Soviet representative suggested convening an international conference with representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the People's Republic of China, and relevant countries to discuss the Korean question. The purpose of this suggestion was to continue resolving the issues of peace and unification in Korea through negotiations, in order to establish a peaceful, unified, independent, and democratic Korea.

Not only did the American imperialists reject the reasonable and just suggestion of the Soviet representative, but they also used pressure on the United Nations General Assembly to pass an illegal resolution, attempting to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean question.

At the meeting of the Korean Armistice Commission held in Kaesong on November 21st, the representatives of the Korean-Chinese side suggested that both sides should allow the people of Korea to move freely through the demilitarized zone and the demarcation line so that they could contact each other and exchange opinions on issues conducive to the reunification of Korea. This suggestion is completely in line with the interests and ardent wishes of the people of both the North and South of Korea.

However, the American imperialists stubbornly refused to discuss this reasonable and just suggestion, even though they could not offer any excuse to oppose it.

At the same time, the American imperialists shamelessly violated the Korean Armistice Agreement, openly providing military assistance to the traitorous Syngman Rhee clique, and condoning the Syngman Rhee group's acts of terror against the people, expanding armaments, and conducting provocative activities to undermine peace.

The above facts prove the cunning conspiracy of the American imperialists to maintain the division of Korea for a long time, obstruct the reunification of Korea, and use South Korea as a military base to prepare for a new war.

The American imperialists are actively carrying out similar treacherous conspiracies in South Vietnam. The American imperialists shamelessly violated the Vietnam Armistice Agreement, openly providing military assistance to the Ngo Dinh Diem army and directly training the Ngo Dinh Diem army, instigating their French and Vietnamese lackeys to carry out acts of terror and massacres against the residents, infringing upon democratic rights in South Vietnam, and preparing to oppose the unification of Vietnam through general elections.

The Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, who are resolutely struggling against all conspiracies and activities that undermine the implementation of the Geneva Accords, resolutely oppose the actions of the American imperialists and the Syngman Rhee gang to undermine peace, obstruct the reunification of Korea, and shamelessly violate the armistice agreement reached by both sides.

The Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam warmly support the Soviet Union's proposal at the United Nations General Assembly to convene an international conference to continue discussing the Korean question; and fully support the suggestion made by the representatives of the Korean-Chinese side at the Korean Armistice Commission that both sides should allow the people of North and South Korea to contact each other and exchange opinions for the benefit of Korean unification.

Now, the Korean people, like the Vietnamese people, are striving for the peace, unification, independence, and democracy of their motherland.

The Vietnamese people fully endorse and warmly support the just struggle of the Korean people. They firmly believe that the just struggle of the Korean people, like the struggle of the Vietnamese people, will achieve complete victory with the strong support of the world's forces for peace."

    越南外交部发表关于朝鲜问题的声明
    【新华社讯】据越南通讯社河内十二月三十一日电：越南民主共和国外交部十二月三十一日发表了一个声明，抗议美帝国主义者阻挠朝鲜统一。声明全文如下：
    “在今年十二月初举行的联合国大会政治委员会会议上，苏联代表曾建议召开有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中华人民共和国和有关国家的代表参加的国际会议来讨论朝鲜问题。这个建议的目的是继续通过谈判来解决朝鲜的和平和统一问题，以便建立一个和平、统一、独立和民主的朝鲜。
    美帝国主义者不仅拒绝了苏联代表的合理的和公正的建议，而且还对联合国大会使用压力，使它通过了非法的决议，企图阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决。
    十一月二十一日在开城举行的朝鲜停战委员会会议上，朝中方面代表团建议，双方应该允许朝鲜人民通过非军事区和分界线自由来往，以便他们可以互相接触并且在对朝鲜统一有利的问题上交换意见。这个建议完全符合于北部以及南部的朝鲜人民的利益和热切的愿望。
    但是，美帝国主义者一味拒绝讨论这个合理的、公正的建议，虽然他们不能拿出任何借口来反对这个建议。
    同时，美帝国主义者无耻地违反朝鲜停战协定，公开给予李承晚卖国集团以军事援助，并且纵容李承晚集团对人民采取恐怖行动，扩充军备，进行挑衅性活动来破坏和平。
    上述事实证明了美帝国主义者要长期保持朝鲜的分裂状态，阻挠朝鲜的统一和利用南朝鲜作为准备新战争的军事基地的狡猾阴谋。
    美帝国主义者正在南越积极地进行着类似的背信弃义的阴谋活动。美帝国主义者无耻地违反了越南停战协定，公开把军事援助交给吴庭艳军队并且直接训练吴庭艳军队，怂恿他们的法国和越南仆从们对居民采取恐怖行动和进行大规模屠杀，在南越侵犯民主权利并且准备反对通过普选来统一越南。”
    正在为反对一切破坏日内瓦协定的实施的阴谋和活动而坚决斗争的越南人民和越南民主共和国政府，坚决反对美帝国主义者和李承晚匪帮破坏和平、阻挠朝鲜统一和无耻地违反双方达成的停战协定的行为。
    越南人民和越南民主共和国政府热烈支持苏联在联合国大会上提出的召开国际会议继续讨论朝鲜问题的建议；完全支持朝中方面代表团在朝鲜停战委员会提出的建议双方为了朝鲜统一的利益允许南北朝鲜人民进行接触和交换意见的建议。
    现在，朝鲜人民和越南人民一样，正在努力为他们祖国的和平、统一、独立和民主而斗争。
    越南人民完全赞成并且热烈支持朝鲜人民的正义斗争。他们坚信：朝鲜人民这种正义的斗争和越南人民的斗争一样，在世界和平力量的坚强支持之下一定会取得完全的胜利。”
