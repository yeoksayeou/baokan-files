    Convening of Representatives Conference of Young Socialist Builders
    Liaoning Province convened the Representatives Conference of Young Socialist Builders who graduated from junior high and senior elementary schools in Shenyang City from December 20th to 25th last year. A total of 307 junior high and senior elementary school graduates from various cities and counties in the province who are participating in production attended the meeting.

    In 1954, more than 20,000 junior high school graduates and 200,000 senior elementary school graduates in the province participated in industrial and agricultural production. Because they possessed a certain degree of socialist consciousness and cultural and scientific knowledge, they played a significant role in production, and many advanced workers emerged. Zhang Wanfu, a fitter at Jinxi Petroleum Factory No. 5 and a senior elementary school graduate, and Zhu Guihua, a feeder at Yixian Liming Agricultural Production Cooperative, and other advanced workers introduced their exemplary deeds and advanced ideas on how they overcame difficulties and achieved success in production at the meeting.

    Qiu Youwen, Vice Chairman of the Liaoning Provincial People's Government, gave instructions at the meeting. He said: Junior high and senior elementary school graduates in the province who are participating in production should further clarify and strengthen their revolutionary outlook on life, strengthen their labor concept, and strive to learn production technology and cultural and scientific knowledge. The representatives at the meeting unanimously believed that the country's socialist construction has opened up a bright future for the younger generation, and advanced figures have set an example for everyone. They unanimously expressed that they will continue to contribute their strength to the country's socialist construction in the future.

    召开青年社会主义建设者代表会议
    辽宁省于去年十二月二十日至二十五日在沈阳市召开了初中、高小毕业的青年社会主义建设者代表会议。出席这次会议的有全省各市县参加生产的初中、高小毕业生共三百零七人。
    一九五四年全省有两万多名初中毕业生和二十万名高小毕业生参加了工农业生产。由于他们具备了一定的社会主义觉悟和文化科学知识，在生产中起了很大作用，并出现了许多先进工作者。锦西石油五厂钳工、高小毕业生张万富，义县黎明农业生产合作社饲养员朱贵华等先进工作者都在会上介绍了他们如何在生产当中克服困难取得成就的模范事迹和先进思想。
    辽宁省人民政府副主席仇友文到会作了指示。他说：全省参加生产的初中、高小毕业生，今后要进一步明确和坚定革命人生观，加强劳动观念，努力学习生产技术和文化科学知识。到会代表一致认为：国家社会主义建设给青年一代开辟了美好的前途，先进人物为大家树立了榜样。他们一致表示今后要继续在国家社会主义建设中贡献出自己的力量。
