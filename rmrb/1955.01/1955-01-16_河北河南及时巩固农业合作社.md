Xinhua News Agency report: Hebei Province has completed its plan for developing agricultural production cooperatives this past winter and spring and is now focusing all efforts on consolidation and rectification. To date, the province has developed 100,586 agricultural production cooperatives, with more than 2.76 million participating households, accounting for 35.45 percent of the province's total households.

In implementing the plan for developing agricultural production cooperatives, Party organizations at all levels in Hebei Province generally adhered to the principle of simultaneous preparation, development, and consolidation, building a batch, consolidating a batch. However, due to the rapid and large-scale development, the "four appraisals" (assessment of labor power, land, livestock, and farm tools) have not yet been completed in some cooperatives, the labor organization is unreasonable, production plans have not yet been formulated, and some cooperatives were even established in a rush, with some participating farmers' thinking not yet solid and their production enthusiasm unstable. The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has instructed all localities to stop development and focus on rectification and consolidation. Shijiazhuang, Tongxian, Baoding, and other special districts and counties have successively convened meetings of large and medium-sized cooperative directors, focusing on solving the problems of labor organization and winter production plans. Various localities have also organized strong work teams, focusing on cooperatives with more problems, to carry out rectification and consolidation work. In rectifying cooperatives, various localities have also given full play to the role of mutual aid and cooperation networks. Huanghua County organized 100 old cooperative backbone members with experience in running cooperatives to help new cooperatives solve some of the problems in the "four appraisals" through mutual aid and cooperation networks. Jingxian County exchanged experiences in the contract labor system through mutual aid and cooperation networks.

Xinhua News Agency report: While developing agricultural production cooperatives, Henan Province has paid attention to consolidating existing agricultural production cooperatives. In order to ensure that every expanded or newly established cooperative can be consolidated in a timely manner, various localities extracted a certain number of cadres to assist existing cooperatives in carrying out a rectification work before the full launch of the winter cooperative establishment work. The 2,870 new cooperatives established in Anyang Special District last autumn were hastily established at the time, and many cooperative members were not sufficiently ideologically mobilized and the "four appraisals" (assessment of labor power, land, livestock, and farm tools) were unreasonable. After rectification, more than 80 percent of the cooperatives immediately established labor organizations, formulated production plans, and quickly launched production. After the winter cooperative establishment work began, many places placed their main efforts on helping consolidate and improve existing cooperatives. The Lushan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened a representative meeting of new and old cooperative directors in the county to inspect the county's original new and old cooperatives, and also solved and promoted working methods such as "division of labor and specialization" and "long-term planning and short-term arrangements" for these cooperatives based on their situations and existing problems. Then, it organized old cooperatives to impart experience to new cooperatives to help new cooperatives specifically rectify cooperative affairs. As a result, the county's 569 new and old cooperatives were gradually consolidated.

    河北河南及时巩固农业合作社
    据新华社讯：河北省去冬今春发展农业生产合作社的计划已经完成，现在正全力进行巩固和整顿工作。到目前为止，全省农业生产合作社已发展到十万零五百八十六个，入社农户达二百七十六万多户，占全省总户数的百分之三十五点四五。
    河北省各级党的组织，在执行农业生产合作社发展计划的过程中，一般都贯彻了边准备、边发展、边巩固，建一批、巩固一批的方针。但是由于迅速地大量地发展，至今尚有部分的社“四评”没有作完，劳动组织不合理，生产计划还没有制订，甚至有些社是一哄而起，有些入社农民的思想还不巩固，生产情绪不稳定。中共河北省委已指示各地停止发展，以大力进行整顿和巩固。石家庄、通县、保定等专区各县曾先后召开了大、中社社长会议，着重解决了劳动组织和冬季生产计划的问题。各地还组织了强大的工作组，以问题较多的社为重点，进行整顿巩固工作。各地在整顿社中，还充分发挥了互助合作网的作用，黄骅县组织一百名有办社经验的老社骨干分子，通过互助合作网帮助新社解决了“四评”当中的一些问题。景县通过互助合作网交流了包工制的经验。
    据新华社讯：河南省各地在发展农业生产合作社的同时，注意巩固现有农业生产合作社。各地为使每一个扩建或新建的社，都能及时得到巩固，早在冬季建社工作全面展开前，就抽出一定数量的干部，协助现有的社进行了一次整顿工作。安阳专区去年秋季建立的两千八百七十个新社，当时因为建社工作进行粗糙，不少社社员思想发动不够充分、“四评”（评劳力、土地、牲畜、农具）工作不合理，经过整顿后，有百分之八十以上的社都立即建立了劳动组织，订出了生产计划，迅速地开展了生产。冬季建社工作开展后，许多地方都把主要力量放在帮助巩固提高原有社上。中共鲁山县委员会最近通过召开全县新、老社长代表会，检查了全县原有的新、老社，还针对这些社的情况和存在的问题，分别解决、推广“分工分业”和“长计划、短安排”等工作方法。接着，又组织老社向新社传授经验，帮助新社具体整顿社务。这样做的结果，就使全县五百六十九个新、老社，逐渐地巩固起来。
