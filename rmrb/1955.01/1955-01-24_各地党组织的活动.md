    Activities of Party Organizations in Various Regions

    Educating Cadres and Workers to Cherish Machinery and Equipment

    Tianjin has a large amount of machinery and equipment in its factories and enterprises, and the full utilization of this equipment is of great significance for the realization of national socialist industrialization. However, because some cadres install and use machines casually without understanding their performance, and have not established necessary maintenance and repair systems, and more so because of the lack of education for the workers by the leadership, some workers have relaxed labor discipline, neglected cleaning, lubrication, and maintenance work, violated operating procedures, or moved machines without authorization, the phenomenon of damage to machinery and equipment in various factories is quite common. The rubber mixing machine in the Tianjin No. 2 Local State-owned Rubber Factory could not be repaired on time, and the work-hours lost each month due to machine accidents were equivalent to three machines stopping production. Some factories have a gantry milling machine, a new product shipped from the Soviet Union in 1954, which was damaged in ten places shortly after installation; a rubber calender produced in Czechoslovakia, used for less than half a year, had gears worn to the extent equivalent to being used for more than ten years.

    In response to the above situation, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on January 13 regarding cherishing machinery and equipment and checking the condition of machine maintenance. According to the instructions of the Municipal Committee, the Industrial Department of the Municipal Committee convened a meeting of the Party Committee Secretaries and Directors of the Tianjin Municipal Industrial Bureaus, as well as some factory Party Branch Secretaries and Factory Directors, to arrange for the inspection of machine maintenance work, and issued a notice on maintaining machinery and equipment.

    Correcting the Phenomenon of Indiscriminate Logging of Forests

    In the Tangshan area, the phenomenon of indiscriminate logging of trees by farmers in some counties is very serious. In the mountainous areas of only Qian'an and six other counties, more than 62,000 trees were felled. The Tangshan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China studied this issue and believed that the main reason was that some cadres did not thoroughly publicize the policy of mutual aid and cooperation to the farmers, and when the farmers joined the cooperatives, they rigidly stipulated that land and forests should be included together, and landlords and rich peasants took the opportunity to spread rumors and sabotage, resulting in ideological confusion among the farmers and indiscriminate logging of trees. The Tangshan Prefectural Committee has instructed all counties to pay serious attention. Mountain area Party committees must thoroughly understand the various reasons for farmers' indiscriminate logging of trees, and propose specific solutions to stop this phenomenon; and should immediately order relevant departments and work teams to quickly rectify and establish forest protection organizations. At the same time, it is necessary to be vigilant and strictly prevent landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries from spreading rumors and inciting the masses to destroy forests. The Prefectural Committee also instructed all counties to strengthen political education for farmers in mountainous areas, repeatedly and thoroughly publicize the socialist vision of greening the mountainous areas; clearly explain the afforestation policy of "whoever plants owns, those who plant together own together, the village plants and the village owns"; criticize the erroneous ideas of "afforestation for public ownership" and "joining the cooperative is useless," to stabilize the mood of the masses and encourage their enthusiasm for afforestation and forest protection.

    Rectifying the Propaganda Network After the End of Unified Purchase and Sale Work

    The Party Branch of Dongyan Village, Wuji County, Hebei Province, rectified the propaganda network after the end of the unified purchase and sale work. The propagandists of Dongyan Village played a role in this unified purchase and sale work. At the end of the work, the branch first summarized the propaganda work, and then held a propagandists' meeting, explaining that the smooth completion of this unified purchase and sale work was largely due to the good propaganda work. At the meeting, nine propagandists including Li Fulu, who worked actively, were commended. Individual propagandists who had poor character and a bad influence among the masses were criticized, and they were removed from their positions as propagandists. Thirteen activists with propaganda abilities were absorbed into the ranks of propagandists during this grain purchase. The propagandists were in high spirits and said: "With rewards and punishments, everyone will work hard." Propagandists who were afraid of delaying their work in the past and were not active also said that they would definitely do a good job in propaganda in the future. After democratic discussion, the conference determined a system of holding a general meeting once a month, a study meeting every half month, and a group leader reporting to the branch once every half month. The branch also made specific arrangements for the next phase of propaganda work.

    Pay Attention to Educating New Party Members

    Recently, the General Branch of the Communist Party of China in Fuzhou Town, Jiangxi, conducted a test of basic Party knowledge on twenty-three new Party members in various branches. The test results showed that thirteen Party members failed. Some did not even know the nature of the Party or the rights and obligations of Party members. Based on this situation, the General Branch of the Party in Fuzhou Town made a long-term plan to strengthen the education of basic Party knowledge, and decided to establish a Party lesson system, with members of the General Branch Committee and responsible cadres of various agencies serving as Party lesson teachers. Now, Party lesson education has begun. In Party lesson education, some members of the Communist Youth League and activists are also absorbed to participate. (Zhou Junxiang)

    各地党组织的活动
    教育干部职工爱护机器设备
    天津市各工厂企业中有大量的机器设备，充分利用这些设备对实现国家社会主义工业化有极重要的意义。但是，因为有些干部不了解机器性能就随便安装，随便使用，没有建立必要的维护检修制度，更由于领导上对工人群众缺乏教育，有的工人劳动纪律松弛，忽视清洁、润滑、保养工作，违反操作规程，或擅自搬弄机器，以致各厂损坏机器设备的现象相当普遍。地方国营天津橡胶二厂的炼胶机由于不能按时检修，每月因机器发生事故损失的工时就相当于三台机器停止生产。有些厂有一部龙门铣床，是从苏联运来的一九五四年的新产品，安装不久，竟损伤了十处；有一部捷克斯洛伐克出产的橡胶压延机，使用不到半年，齿轮被磨损竟相当于使用了十几年后磨损的程度。
    针对以上情况，中共天津市委于一月十三日发出了关于爱护机器设备、检查机器保养状况的指示。市委工业部根据市委指示，召集了天津市各工业管理局党委书记、局长及部分工厂党支部书记、厂长举行会议，布置检查机器保养工作，并发出了关于保养机器设备的通知。
    纠正滥伐山林树木现象
    唐山地区有些县的山区农民，滥伐树木的现象很严重，只迁安等六个县的山区就砍伐了六万两千多棵树。中共唐山地委研究了这一问题，认为主要是有些干部向农民宣传互助合作政策不深入，在农民入社时，又硬性地规定土地、林木一齐入社，加上地主、富农趁机造谣破坏，以致造成农民思想混乱，滥伐树木。唐山地委已指示各县应严重引起注意。山区党委必须深入了解农民滥伐树木的各种根由，提出具体的解决办法，以制止这种现象；并应立即责成有关部门和工作组，迅速整顿和建立护林组织。同时，要提高警惕，严防地主、富农和反革命分子造谣煽动群众破坏林木。地委还指示各县要加强对山区农民的政治教育，反复深入地向农民宣传绿化山区的社会主义远景；明确交代“谁种谁有、伙种伙有、村种村有”的造林政策；批判“造林归公”“入社白搭”的错误思想，以安定群众情绪，鼓励群众造林护林的积极性。
    统购统销工作结束整顿宣传网
    中共河北无极县东验村支部在统购统销工作结束时，整顿了宣传网。东验村的宣传员在这次统购统销工作中发挥了作用。工作结束时，支部首先总结了宣传工作，接着召开了宣传员大会，说明这次统购统销工作能够顺利完成，宣传工作做得好是个重要原因。会上表扬了工作积极的宣传员李福禄等九人，有个别宣传员品质不好、在群众中影响很坏，在对他们进行批评后，取消了他们担任宣传员的工作。并吸收这次购粮中十三名有宣传能力的积极分子为宣传员。宣传员情绪很高。纷纷反映：“有奖有罚，谁干着也上劲。”过去怕误活，不积极工作的宣传员也表示今后一定把宣传工作做好。经过民主讨论，大会确定了每月开一次全体会、半月开一次学习会、小组长半月向支部报告一次工作的制度。支部又对下段宣传工作做了具体安排。
    注意对新党员进行教育
    中共江西抚州镇机关总支，最近在各分支对二十三个新党员进行了党的基本知识的测验。测验结果，有十三个党员没有及格。有的连党的性质、党员的权利和义务都不知道。根据这种情况，抚州镇机关党总支作了较长时期加强党的基本知识的教育计划，决定建立党课制度，由总支委员和各机关党员负责干部担任党课教员。现在，党课教育已开始进行。在党课教育中，并吸收了一部分青年团员和积极分子参加。（周君祥）
