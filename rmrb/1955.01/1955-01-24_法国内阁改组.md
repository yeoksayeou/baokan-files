    French Cabinet Reshuffle
    [Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 22nd] Paris Dispatch: French Prime Minister Mendès France announced a cabinet reshuffle on the 20th. This is the fifth cabinet reshuffle since the cabinet was formed last June.
    The reshuffled cabinet has 37 ministerial and undersecretary positions. This is five more positions than in the previous Laniel government, which already had a large number of personnel. "Le Parisien Libéré" pointed out that the "expansion" of ministerial positions is to seek a "majority" to support the government.
    After the reshuffle, Mendès France concurrently holds the post of Minister of Economic Planning, while relinquishing the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs to Edgar Faure, who also belongs to the Radical Socialist Party.
    The reshuffled cabinet has added members of the Social Republican Party (i.e., the Gaullist faction), including Chaban-Delmas (appointed Minister of Merchant Marine), who once voted against the Paris Accords. Reuters analyzed this point, saying that Mendès France's "purpose is to win over the Gaullist parliamentary group in the National Assembly."
    Mendès France once again co-opted the Popular Republican Party, which opposes him, and allocated the positions of Minister of Finance and Economy and Minister of French Overseas Territories to Popular Republican Party members Robert Buron and Jacques Hugues. It is known that Mendès France once invited Robert Schuman, a well-known pro-American figure in the Popular Republican Party, to join the cabinet, but was rejected.
    According to Agence France-Presse, Parisian newspapers' attitude towards this reshuffle is "quite reserved";
    "Commentators do not believe that this reshuffle can strengthen the Prime Minister's position in Parliament."

    法国内阁改组
    【新华社二十二日讯】巴黎消息：法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯二十日宣布内阁改组。这是内阁自从去年六月组成以来的第五次改组。
    改组后的部长和次长职位达三十七个。比人员众多的前届拉尼埃政府中的职位还多出五个。“解放了的巴黎人报”指出：部长职位的“膨胀”，是为了谋求支持政府的“多数”。
    改组后，孟戴斯—弗朗斯自兼经济计划部长，而把原兼外交部长职位让给同属激进社会党的埃加·富尔。
    改组后的内阁中增添了社会共和党（即戴高乐派）党员，其中有曾经投票反对巴黎协定的许米特兰（出任海运部长）。路透社分析这一点说，孟戴斯—弗朗斯的“目的在于拉拢国民议会中的戴高乐派议会党团”。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯再度笼络反对他的人民共和党，把财政经济部长和法国海外属地部长职位分配给人民共和党党员罗伯·布隆和雅克·许格拉。大家知道，孟戴斯—弗朗斯曾经邀请人民共和党的著名亲美分子罗伯·舒曼入阁，但遭到了拒绝。
    据法新社报道，巴黎报纸评论这次改组时的态度是“相当保留的”；
  “评论家并不认为这次改组可以加强总理在议会中的地位”。
