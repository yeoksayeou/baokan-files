    "We Have No Winter Here"
    By Our Correspondent Yuan Liang
    In December 1954, the 3206 drilling team of the Jiuquan Drilling Office of the Petroleum Administration Bureau once again set a new record of 1,065.5 meters of monthly progress in oil drilling. This achievement was attained in the severe cold of around minus 30 degrees Celsius.
    During that month, I visited the 3206 team's drilling site several times. There I saw that the lower part of the drilling rig, which was more than forty meters high, was surrounded by a thick layer of canvas. Warm steam pipes were installed along the most important oil and water pipes of the diesel engine, and some places were even wrapped with wool. The mud tanks and water tanks, which were larger than the water storage tanks at ordinary railway stations, had rubber pipes spitting out hot air hanging down into them. However, on the machine base in the open air (the machine room was still under construction at the time), on the wool wrapping the pipes, and even on the rope tied to the warm steam pipe joints, small, shimmering ice columns could still be seen everywhere. Around the "turntable" on the drilling platform, under the feet of the workers, were mud clods frozen like pebbles. Severe cold enveloped everything. But Cao Qi, the deputy captain of the drilling team, said: "We have no winter here." This statement is reasonable.
    At the beginning of December, during the days when they were installing the drilling rig, they encountered strong winds, which felt like needle pricks and knife cuts on the face. If one was careless and a wet hand touched ironware, a piece of skin would be stuck off. However, most of their work involved dealing with steel. Zhao Lin's team worked the night shift from 0:00 to 8:00 for nine consecutive nights – the coldest hours.
    For the last two or three nights, the main task was tightening screws. Some of the screws were very small, making it particularly difficult to install them properly: Should they wear gloves? It would be difficult to hold the screws. If they didn't wear gloves? The screws were so cold that they pierced the hands. But the installation work couldn't be stopped for a moment. They had only one thing in mind: install it quickly, start drilling quickly!
    What method did they use to tighten the screws? They would first take off one glove, pinch a screw out of the iron barrel, immediately insert it into the screw hole, and then put the glove back on to tighten it. That was how they installed the machine.
    When the drilling rig was almost installed, the diesel engine became mute due to the cold. This worried the maintenance workers.
    At that time, there was no warm steam at the drilling site, so they had to make a fire to bake it. Who knew that this frozen low-pressure oil pipe would crack with a bang at the sight of the fire?
    "What to do? Quickly replace it with another one!" Maintenance worker You Xingming decisively took the tools and the pipe and climbed under the machine. There was not even the "freedom" to turn over under the machine. He could only lie on his back on the frozen ground to work. The oil and water from the diesel engine dripped onto his face and body, but he didn't seem to notice. At five o'clock, the new pipe was replaced, and he crawled out from under the machine.
    The two flaps of his cotton coat were frozen as hard as armor, and his hat brim, cap flaps, collar, and even eyebrows were covered with fluffy frost. He didn't even pat it off, but leaned against the stool next to the stove in the activity room and fell into a daze.
    At seven o'clock, the first wake-up call awakened him again. He suddenly straightened up, rubbed his eyes, immediately went to the kitchen, took two steamed buns, and walked towards the drilling site while eating. He was "stuck" to the drilling site again until the machine started the next morning at eight o'clock, when he breathed a sigh of relief. He said to himself, "Now we can start drilling."
    This team had already completed the annual national plan in August 1954. By mid-December, it had increased production and saved the country fifty billion yuan in wealth. December was already very cold, and the state gave them a footage task of 800 meters, which was not only not reduced compared to other seasons, but increased. There were more difficulties in winter, such as the biggest difficulty at that time was the lack of water, because the water sources in the Gobi Desert were frozen. This almost caused them to stop drilling. Later, the drivers of the transportation team transported water day and night to support them, so that their water tanks did not dry up and the boiler did not stop burning. This enabled them to organize rapid drilling and create a glorious new record in the severe cold.

### “我们这里没有冬天”

    “我们这里没有冬天”
    本报记者　袁良
    一九五四年十二月份，石油管理总局钻探局酒泉钻探处的三二零六钻井队，又创造了石油钻井月进一千零六十五点五公尺的新纪录。这一成绩是在摄氏零下三十度左右的严寒中取得的。
    在这个月份里，我曾经几次到三二零六队的井场去。在那里我看到了：那四十多公尺高的井架下部，围上了一层厚厚的帆布。沿着柴油机上那些最要紧的油管、水管旁边，都安上了暖汽管子，有的地方还用羊毛把它们包扎起来。比一般火车站上的储水库还大的泥浆罐和水罐里，都垂挂着吐着热气的橡皮管子。可是在那露天地里（机器房当时才在筹建）的机器底座上、包扎管线的羊毛上、甚至系在暖汽管接口处的绳头上，到处仍可看到寒光闪闪的小凌柱。在井台上“转盘”周围，工人同志们的脚下，是冻结得像卵石似的泥浆疙瘩。严寒笼罩了一切。但是钻井队副队长曹麒却说：“我们这里没有冬天。”这句话是有道理的。
    十二月初，他们安装钻机那几天，正赶上刮大风，那风吹在脸上，就像针刺刀割一般。要是不留神，湿手碰着铁器，肉皮就会被黏下一块来。可是他们的工作，却多半又是和钢铁打交道。赵麟那一班人，一连九个夜晚是零时至八时的夜班。——这是最冷的时刻。
    最后两三个晚上，主要的活儿是紧螺丝。有的螺丝钉很小，要把它安好，可有着特殊的困难：戴上手套吧？不好拿螺丝；不戴手套吧？螺丝冰冷得直扎手。可是安装工作一会也不能停，他们心里想的只有一件事：快安好、快开钻！
    用什么办法紧螺丝呢？他们都是先脱掉一只手套，从铁筒里捏出一个螺丝钉来，马上就把它塞到螺丝眼里去，接着再戴上手套把它拧紧。这样才把机器安装起来。
    钻机快安装好的时候，柴油机又被冻成哑吧了。这可急坏了检修工们。
    当时，井场里没有暖汽，只得生点火去烘烤。谁知道这根受了冻的低压油管子，一见火就咯崩一声炸裂了。
    “怎么办？赶快换上一根！”检修工优兴明当机立断地拿了工具和管子，爬到机器下面去。在机器下面连翻一下身子的“自由”都没有。他只能仰卧在那冰冻的地上进行工作。柴油机上的油、水，滴滴答答地淋到他的脸上和身上，他都好像没有发觉。到了五点钟的时候，新的管子换好了，他才从机器底下爬出来。
    棉衣的两个对襟，冻得硬梆梆的像盔甲一样，帽檐上、帽扇上、袄领上，还有眉毛上，都长上了毛茸茸的霜花，他连拍打一下都没有，便靠在活动房子里的暖炉旁边的凳子上，矇矇眬眬入睡了。
    七点钟第一响的起床钟声，又唤醒了他。他忽地一下直起腰来，揉了揉眼睛，立刻到伙房里去，取了两个馒头，边吃边向井场走去。他又“黏”到了井场上，直到第二天早晨八点钟机器发动的时候，他才松了一口气。他自言自语地说：“现在能够开钻了。”
    这个队在一九五四年八月份的时候，就已经完成了全年的国家计划。到十二月中已给国家增产节约五十来亿元的财富。十二月份，已经是很冷的天气了，国家给予他们的进尺任务是八百公尺，这比其他季节不但没有减少，反而增多了。冬天的困难更多，比方当时最大的一个困难是没有水，因为戈壁滩上的水源冻结了。这几乎使他们停钻。后来运输大队的司机同志日日夜夜地运水支援他们，才使他们的水罐没有干涸，锅炉没有停烧。使他们有条件组织快速钻井，在严寒中创造了光荣的新纪录。
