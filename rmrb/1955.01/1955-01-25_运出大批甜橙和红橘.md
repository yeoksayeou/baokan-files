Large Quantities of Sweet Oranges and Red Tangerines Shipped Out

Sichuan Province shipped out a large quantity of sweet oranges and red tangerines last year. The Jiangjin Special District alone shipped out more than 6,000 tons, of which 2,000 tons were exported to the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries. Last year, this special district had more than 500 cadres and 1,200 technicians participating in the sweet orange export work. Farmers also improved their loading, selection, and other work, resulting in an overfulfillment of the export plan by 66 percent.

Last year, the Southwest Sweet Orange Export Committee also used the experience of sweet orange exports to test ship two train cars of red tangerines, which are more difficult to store, abroad, creating experience for large-scale exports of red tangerines in the future. (Ji Heng)

    运出大批甜橙和红橘
    四川省去年运出大量甜橙和红橘。仅江津专区就运出六千多吨，其中有二千吨出口到苏联和人民民主国家。去年这个专区先后有五百多名干部、一千二百多名技工参加了甜橙外销工作，农民们也改进了装运、挑选等工作，结果使出口计划超额完成百分之六十六。
    西南甜橙外销委员会去年还根据甜橙出口的经验，试运了两车皮储存比较困难的红橘出国，为今后大量输出红橘创造了经验。　（纪恒）
