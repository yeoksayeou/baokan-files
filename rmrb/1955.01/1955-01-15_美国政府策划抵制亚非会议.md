Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 13th, TASS: According to the American "Newsweek," the U.S. government's "highest authorities" are currently discussing whether Washington and London should persuade their partners to boycott the upcoming Asian-African Conference.

    The magazine points out that Walter Robertson, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, is the most fervent advocate of boycotting the conference. It is well known that Robertson represents the interests of those American groups who particularly want to invade China. Those who advocate boycotting express dissatisfaction with the People's Republic of China being invited to attend the conference. At the same time, they say that if the U.S. State Department does not express support for a boycott, then this "will cause disputes between the U.S. State Department and Kuomintang China, as well as the pro-Chiang Kai-shek faction in the U.S. Congress."

    美国政府策划抵制亚非会议
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社纽约十三日讯：据美国“新闻周刊”报道，目前美国政府“最高机构”正在讨论一个问题：华盛顿和伦敦是否应该劝说自己的伙伴抵制即将召开的亚非会议。
    这家杂志指出，负责远东事务的美国助理国务卿罗伯逊是主张抵制这个会议的最激烈的人。大家知道罗伯逊是代表那些特别想侵略中国的美国集团的利益的。主张抵制的人对中华人民共和国被邀请出席这个会议表示不满。同时，他们说，如果美国国务院不表示赞成抵制，那么这就“会使美国国务院和国民党中国以及美国国会中拥护蒋介石的一派人发生争执”。
