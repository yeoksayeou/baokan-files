    Complacency is Our Enemy
    Wang Zuoqun, Director of Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory

    The Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory began trial manufacturing of 6,000-kilowatt steam turbines in September 1953.

    The 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine is a modern power machine with a fairly high degree of precision. Through trial manufacturing, we can raise our factory from the level of a repair and assembly industry to the level of independently manufacturing highly precise power machines. This will not only lay the foundation for our factory's future formal production, but also create and prepare conditions for China's second steam turbine factory. During the year-plus of trial manufacturing, we relied on the creative labor of the workers to overcome many difficulties. Although lacking the necessary equipment conditions, a considerable number of tools and fixtures were designed by our factory itself. For example, a set of tools for grinding the main shaft with a grinding wheel on a lathe achieved a high degree of technical requirements. The T-shaped root of the milled blades has extremely strict tolerance requirements. We did not have a dual-axis milling machine. After more than a month of research by the tool workshop, the milling cutter was successfully ground, enabling the blade root processing to meet the design accuracy requirements. The workers also overcame the difficulty of not having a facing lathe when processing the impellers, ensuring that the impellers met the technical requirements of the design. Other arduous tasks such as the collection of diamond materials, the reproduction of castings and forgings, and the implementation of heat treatment were all completed by many comrades with creative labor. There is no doubt that these achievements have laid an important foundation for the successful trial manufacturing of steam turbines. However, due to the blindly optimistic attitude in our leadership's thinking and the failure to deeply understand the arduousness and complexity of the trial manufacturing work, some errors and shortcomings were still caused, which affected the trial manufacturing work. First, the task of trial manufacturing steam turbines did not become the center of the factory's production activities in the first half of 1954. In the first half of the year, after we revised the planned tasks, we were busy adjusting production and contracting odd jobs from outside. At that time, because the output and value of diesel engines accounted for a large proportion of the factory's production plan and became the key to completing the monthly output value plan, we paid special attention to the production of diesel engines. There were even times when we discussed steam turbine problems in meetings, but after the meeting, we were busy with the production of diesel engines. This situation of inverting priorities shows that our leadership's thinking did not attach enough importance to the trial manufacturing of steam turbines. At the same time, the leadership's requirements for the quality of trial-manufactured steam turbines were also not strict. For example, the technical requirement for the steam outlet of the stationary blades of a cast partition with a diameter of more than one meter cannot differ by more than ten threads, which is a very strict requirement, but we did not make the greatest effort to complete it, so several defective products were produced, which greatly delayed production. Second, the organizational leadership of the steam turbine trial manufacturing work was not strong. The original trial manufacturing committee was an unreasonable organizational form and failed to give full play to its role, so much so that later even meetings were rarely held. Although the trial manufacturing work was personally controlled by the chief engineer under the guidance of Czechoslovak experts, and full-time engineers and technicians were also appointed to be specifically responsible, it did not proceed well because the engineers and technicians had serious individualistic work styles, and there were repeated instances of workers not strictly complying with process discipline. For example, when casting partitions, the experts' instructions were not conscientiously implemented, and the engineering and technical personnel casually raised the bridge. The molten iron did not reach the specified temperature during casting, resulting in scrapping and causing production losses. For example, the metalworking process regulations for the steam chamber were also scrapped twice because they were not thoroughly followed in accordance with Czechoslovak regulations. These all belong to management problems, which precisely demonstrate our weakness and powerlessness in organizational leadership. Third, the role of experts was not fully utilized. We mistakenly believed that taking more care of the experts in terms of living arrangements meant respecting them. We did not create favorable working conditions for the experts. Before August 1954, we had not equipped the experts' office with appropriate cadres, so that many important opinions and suggestions in the experts' conversation records were not summarized and sorted out. We also did not organize cadres well to learn from the experts. Some technical personnel had a mentality of aiming too high, only liking to listen to technical theories and unwilling to humbly learn management knowledge. Their understanding of the spirit of the experts' instructions was also relatively poor, and there was a lack of inspection and supervision when implementing the experts' suggestions. Therefore, the role of the experts was not fully utilized, causing losses in our work. The occurrence of these errors and shortcomings is mainly due to the complacent attitude in our leadership work. We believed that we had completed the state plan ahead of schedule in 1953 and made achievements in our work. The output value plan for 1954 was not heavier than that for 1953. Although we were trial-manufacturing steam turbines, we had the specific help of Czechoslovak experts, and completing the task would not be a problem. Therefore, we were negligent and blindly optimistic. We underestimated the distance between the factory's existing level and the trial manufacturing of high-grade products such as steam turbines, and we were satisfied with the technology of being able to repair blades and partitions. We did not honestly learn from the Czechoslovak experts. We did not adequately estimate the specific difficulties of our factory in the process of expansion, and we lacked in-depth analysis and research on the complexity of the production tasks of our factory in the transition stage. We did not put the steam turbine trial manufacturing task in the first place in production early enough, and therefore we did not complete the steam turbine trial manufacturing task in a timely manner. After studying the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party's Central Committee and with the help of the higher-level leading organs, we have recognized these errors and are determined to overcome complacency. Under the slogans of "Steam Turbine First" and "Quality First," we will organize the work of various departments around this center through the planning of production technology preparation and workshop operations. Recently, we have organized a considerable force to carefully conduct the appraisal and summary of the trial manufacturing work. Through appraisal, we will prevent unqualified parts from being used in assembly to ensure product quality; through summary, we will draw lessons from experience and further understand and learn Czechoslovak advanced technology to lay the foundation for future small-batch production.

    骄傲自满是我们的敌人
    上海汽轮机厂厂长　王佐群
    上海汽轮机厂从一九五三年九月开始试制六千瓩汽轮机。
    六千瓩汽轮机，是一种精密度相当高的近代化动力机器。通过试造，可以把我们工厂从修配工业的水平，提高到独立制造高度精密动力机器的水平，不仅将为我厂今后的正式生产打下基础，而且还要为我国第二个汽轮机厂创造和准备条件。在一年多的试造中，依靠职工们以创造性的劳动，克服了不少困难。虽然缺乏必要的设备条件，却有相当数量的工具和卡具是我厂自己设计的。例如在车床上装砂轮磨主轴的一套工具，达到了高度的技术要求。铣叶片的丁字形叶根，公差要求极严，我们没有双轴铣床，经过工具车间一个多月的研究，把铣刀磨制成功，使叶根加工达到设计要求的精度。职工们还克服了叶轮加工时没有正面车床的困难，保证叶轮达到设计的技术要求。其他如金钢料的采集，铸锻件的翻制及进行热处理等艰巨任务，都是很多同志以创造性的劳动完成的。毫无疑问，这些成绩已奠定了汽轮机试制成功的重要基础。但是，由于我们领导思想上存在着盲目乐观的情绪，没有深刻体会到试造工作的艰巨性和复杂性，仍然造成了下面的一些错误和缺点，影响了试制工作。一、汽轮机试造任务没有成为一九五四年上半年全厂生产活动的中心。上半年，我们修改完计划任务后，忙着调整生产，向外承揽杂活。当时因为柴油机的产量和产值，占全厂生产计划的比重很大，成为每月完成产值计划的关键，我们就特别重视柴油机的生产，甚至时常有这样的情况：我们在会上讨论的是汽轮机问题，会后却忙着柴油机的生产。这种轻重倒置的情况，说明了我们领导思想并未足够重视汽轮机的试造工作。同时，领导上对于试造汽轮机的质量的要求也不严格。譬如直径一公尺多的铸造隔板，静叶片出汽口的技术要求公差不能相差十丝，这是非常严格的要求，但我们未尽最大努力去完成，所以几次产生废品，耽误生产很大。二、汽轮机试造工作的组织领导不强。原来设立的试造委员会，是一种不合理的组织形式，未能充分发挥作用，以致后来连会议也不大开了。试造工作，虽然在捷克斯洛伐克专家指导下，由总工程师亲自掌握，并且还指定了专职的工程师和技师具体负责，但由于工程师和技师都存在着严重的单干作风，以及在职工中一再发生不严格遵守工艺纪律的现象，所以进行得很不好。例如浇铸隔板，没有认真贯彻专家的指示，工程技术人员随便将过桥提高，浇铸时铁水又没有达到规定的温度，因此报废，造成生产上的损失。又如蒸汽室的金工工艺规程，也是因为没有彻底按照捷克斯洛伐克的规定做而两次报废。这些都属于管理问题，正表现了我们在组织领导上的软弱无力。三、没有充分发挥专家的作用。我们错误地认为从生活上多照顾专家，便算是尊重了专家。我们没有为专家创造有利的工作条件。一九五四年八月以前，一直没有给专家办公室配备适当的干部，以致专家谈话记录，很多重要的意见和建议，都没人归纳整理。我们也没有很好组织干部向专家学习，有些技术人员存在着好高骛远的心理，只喜欢听技术理论，不肯虚心学习管理知识，对于专家指示精神的领会也比较差，而在贯彻专家建议时，也缺乏检查督促，因此也就没有充分发挥专家的作用，造成了我们工作上的损失。这些错误和缺点的发生，主要由于我们在领导工作上存在着骄傲自满情绪。我们认为一九五三年提前超额完成了国家计划，工作有了成绩，一九五四年的产值计划不比一九五三年重，虽然试造汽轮机，但有捷克斯洛伐克专家的具体帮助，完成任务是不会成问题的。因此，麻痹大意，盲目乐观。我们对于工厂现有水平跟试造汽轮机这种高级产品的距离认识不足，满足于能修理叶片和隔板的技术，不老老实实地向捷克斯洛伐克专家学习。对于我厂在扩建过程中的具体困难估计不够，对于我厂在过渡阶段中生产任务的复杂性缺乏深刻的分析研究，没有及早把汽轮机试造任务放在生产上的第一位，因而没有及时完成汽轮机试造任务。经过关于党的四中全会决议的学习，经过上级领导机关的帮助，我们已认识到这些错误，并下定决心克服自满情绪。我们将在“汽轮机第一”、“质量第一”的口号下，通过生产技术准备工作的计划化和车间作业计划，把各部门的工作围绕着这个中心组织起来。最近，我们组织了相当大的力量，认真进行试造工作的鉴定和总结。通过鉴定，防止不合格的零件用到装配上去，以保证产品质量；通过总结，得出经验教训，进一步领会和学习捷克斯洛伐克的先进技术，为今后小批生产打下基础。
