Beijing Agricultural University held its first scientific discussion meeting, which concluded on the 21st.

Representatives from relevant business departments and Soviet experts who participated in the discussion believed that the nineteen papers presented at the meeting all had considerable practical significance. Professor Yu Dafu of the Plant Protection Department's "Several Issues in Establishing Plant Quarantine in China," Professor Huang Ruilun of the Soil Agricultural Chemistry Department's "Current Research and Production Issues of Insecticides and Fungicides," and Professor Li Lianjie of the Soil Agricultural Chemistry Department's "Natural Conditions of the Tibetan Plateau and the Prospects for Agricultural Production" were all closely linked to practice and solved certain problems for agricultural production. Professor Xiong Dashi of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine Department's paper "Preliminary Research Report on Nodular Worms in Chinese Livestock" received favorable comments from Soviet experts. Professor Cai Xu of the Agronomy Department has been studying wheat varieties for many years and has cultivated several high-yielding "Nongda" varieties that are resistant to rust, fertilizer-tolerant, and resistant to lodging, which have been confirmed in experiments. People believe that his paper "Summary of Wheat Rust Resistance Breeding" has certain contributions to increasing wheat production.

Professor Wang Yuhu of the Agricultural Economics Department's paper "On整理(Zhengli) the Issue of the Motherland's Agricultural Academic Heritage" discussed the ingenious cultivation techniques accumulated by Chinese farmers over thousands of years. He talked about the "predictions" and agricultural proverbs compiled and sung by ancient Chinese farmers before the Common Era, and linked the Qin and Han dynasties' research on soil to the use of manure and other fertilizers and attention to breeding using "ear selection" grafting methods. His paper shows that Chinese farmers got rid of fallow farming very early, and used crop rotation for cultivation as early as the mid-6th century. According to Wang Yuhu's preliminary results, there are about 500 kinds of specialized works on production theories and technologies in agronomy, horticulture, animal husbandry, veterinary medicine, and aquaculture in China throughout the ages.

    北京农业大学举行科学讨论会
    北京农业大学第一次科学讨论会已在二十一日结束。
    参加讨论会的有关业务部门的代表和苏联专家等认为讨论会上报告的十九篇论文都有相当的现实意义。植物保护系教授俞大绂的“我国建立植物检疫中的几个问题”、土壤农业化学系教授黄瑞纶的“当前杀虫剂、杀菌剂的研究和生产的问题”、土壤农业化学系教授李连捷的“西藏高原的自然条件与农业生产的前途”等都密切结合实际，为农业生产解决一定的问题。畜牧兽医系教授熊大仕的论文  “中国家畜结节虫的初步研究报告”得到苏联专家的好评。农学系教授蔡旭多年来研究小麦品种，培植了多种“农大号”的抗锈、耐肥、不倒伏的丰产品种，在试验中得到了证实。人们都认为他所作的“小麦抗锈选种总结”的论文对小麦增产有一定的贡献。
    农业经济系教授王毓瑚的论文“关于整理祖国农业学术遗产问题”，论述了我国农民几千年来所累积的精巧的耕种技术。他从公历纪元前我国古代农民编唱的“占候”和农谚，谈到秦汉对土壤的研究联系到使用粪尿等肥料和注意用“穗选”嫁接的方法育种。他的论文说明，我国农民们在很早就摆脱了休耕制，在第六世纪中期就已经用轮作法来进行耕作。据王毓瑚初步整理的结果，我国历代关于农艺、园艺、畜牧、兽医、水产等方面的生产理论和技术的专著约有五百种。
