    Costa Rica Suffers Armed Attack
    Gao Ji
    International public opinion is closely watching the recent events of aggression against Costa Rica. Many newspapers have correctly pointed out that the armed attack on Costa Rica from Nicaragua was planned by the American monopoly capital organization – the "United Fruit Company." The U.S. official's deliberate silence on this armed aggression, and the U.S.-controlled Organization of American States' delaying of effective measures in response to Costa Rica's complaint demanding the cessation of aggression, are not accidental.
    Costa Rica, located in the southern part of Central America, with a population of over 800,000, like other Central American countries, has always been regarded by the "United Fruit Company," which has close ties with the U.S. State Department, as its fiefdom in the "Banana Kingdom." The "United Fruit Company" not only occupies one-third of the country's arable land, controls its production of coffee, bananas, cocoa, rubber, and Manila hemp, but also controls its oil refining, transportation, hydro-electricity, and mining industries. The Figueres government, which came to power after the 1953 general election, is essentially a pro-American government. However, under pressure from the people, Figueres suggested to the "United Fruit Company" in early 1954 to sign a new contract stipulating that the company's income tax be increased from 15 percent to 50 percent, and that it should abandon its tariff exemption rights and pay normal tariffs on its warehouses and imported equipment. At that time, with the Arbenz government in Guatemala having already confiscated the land of the "United Fruit Company," the mouthpiece of American monopoly capital, "Time" magazine, believed that "Figueres' proposal could be said to be full of lovely aura." Now, after the Arbenz government in Guatemala has been overthrown, the "United Fruit Company" has recovered its confiscated land in Guatemala and restored all its old privileges, the American monopoly capital group is even dissatisfied with the Figueres government, which was once "full of lovely aura," and is determined to instigate armed intervention to overthrow the government of Costa Rica.
    It is very clear that the event of Costa Rica suffering aggression is another Guatemala event. Last year's U.S. armed intervention in Guatemala was organized in Nicaragua, and this time the armed attack on Costa Rica was also launched in the same place. People know that the United States has long been continuously transporting arms to Nicaragua, and last year signed a so-called "military aid treaty" with the Somoza government of Nicaragua. More noteworthy is that, according to some American newspapers, many of those who participated in this interventionist army that invaded Costa Rica were the same people who participated in the armed intervention in Guatemala last year. Therefore, it is not difficult to see that this is another armed intervention method used by the American aggressor group against American countries.
    Many things have happened in the countries of Central and South America around the time of the Guatemala event. The U.S. Embassy in Paraguay participated in a coup in Paraguay, overthrowing the original president, Chavez, and replaced him with a pro-American military fascist, Pereyra, as president. After this, the forces of American monopoly capital forced the President of Brazil, Vargas, to commit suicide, and Filo succeeded as president to implement a bloody policy of suppression in order to destroy all resistance to the American colonization of Brazil. This series of subversive activities, coups, and armed interventionist aggression activities carried out by the United States against Guatemala, Paraguay, Brazil, and Costa Rica clearly demonstrates one fact: that the American aggressor group will never allow Central and South American countries to have the slightest right to independence and autonomy. The American aggressor group will spare no effort to foster military dictatorship regimes in the countries of Central and South America that are completely obedient to them, in order to trample the people of the American countries under their feet, so that they can enslave them as they please. This is the true face of American new colonialists.
    The colonialist policy of the American aggressor group of subverting the governments of other countries and enslaving the people of other countries is not only being recklessly implemented in Central and South America, but also attempting to be imposed on the heads of people in other parts of the world. The criminal acts of the American aggressor group in occupying our territory of Taiwan and supporting the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to attack our mainland are also delusions of subverting our government and enslaving our people. The military aggression group established by the United States in Southeast Asia is also nakedly intended to establish American new colonial rule in Southeast Asia. Recently, Indonesia's exposure of the U.S. funding of the South Moluccan rebel elements is also proof of the subversive activities carried out by the United States in Indonesia. According to the confession of William Manhuro, a senior officer of the rebel elements, the U.S. Embassy in Indonesia not only provided the rebel elements with money, but also used the U.S. Embassy's planes to airdrop supplies to the rebel elements.
    The fact is very clear that the new colonialist war policy pursued by the American aggressor group in various parts of the world to establish its world hegemony is the source of threats and unease to all countries in the world. The armed intervention in Costa Rica instigated by the United States has created a threat to the security of the American countries. American public opinion has severely condemned the American aggression. Uruguay's "Debate Newspaper" pointed out: "It goes without saying who is causing the chaotic state of Central America, and who is planning and leading to the almost continuous turmoil in this region." Similarly, the new colonialist war plan of the United States in establishing military aggression groups in Asia, Europe, and other parts of the world has also greatly increased the crisis of a new war. This is something that peace-loving people all over the world cannot ignore.
    The people of the American countries and peace-loving people all over the world have unanimously condemned the American aggression against Guatemala, and now they are opposing the American armed intervention in Costa Rica with the same righteous position. We Chinese people are not only concerned about the independence and security of our own country, but also concerned about the independence and security of other countries. We resolutely oppose the American armed aggression against Costa Rica. We believe that the righteous public opinion of the whole world will sympathize with the people of Costa Rica.

    哥斯达黎加遭受武装进攻
    高集
    国际舆论正密切地注视着最近哥斯达黎加遭受侵略的事件。不少报纸已正确地指出，来自尼加拉瓜的对哥斯达黎加的武装攻击，是美国垄断资本组织——“联合果品公司”所策划的。美国官方对这次武装侵略事件故意保持缄默，美国所控制的美洲国家组织对哥斯达黎加提出的要求制止侵略的控诉，拖延不采取有力的措施，都不是偶然的。
    位于中美洲南部的、拥有八十多万人口的哥斯达黎加，像中美洲的其他国家一样，一向被同美国国务院有密切关系的“联合果品公司”视为是它的“香蕉王国”的封地。“联合果品公司”不但占有这个国家的三分之一的可耕地，控制了它的咖啡、香蕉、可可、橡胶、吕宋麻的生产，并且还控制了它的制油、交通、水电和采矿等业。在一九五三年大选后执政的菲格雷斯政府基本上是一个亲美的政府。但是，菲格雷斯在人民的压力下，曾在一九五四年年初向“联合果品公司”建议签订一项新合同，规定把公司的所得税从百分之十五提高到百分之五十，并且要它放弃关税免税权，对其仓库和入口的装备缴付正常的关税。当时，在危地马拉的阿本斯政府已经没收“联合果品公司”的土地的情况下，美国垄断资本的喉舌“时代”周刊曾认为“菲格雷斯的建议可说是充满了可爱的气息”。现在，在危地马拉阿本斯政府已被颠覆，“联合果品公司”已收回了它在危地马拉被没收的土地和恢复了旧有的一切特权之后，美国垄断资本集团甚至对曾经是“充满了可爱气息”的菲格雷斯政府也感到不满，而决心要策动武装干涉来推翻哥斯达黎加的政府了。
    很显然，哥斯达黎加遭受侵略的事件，是又一次的危地马拉事件。去年美国对危地马拉的武装干涉是在尼加拉瓜组织的，而这一次对哥斯达黎加的武装进攻也是在同一个地方发动的。人们知道，美国很久以来就不断向尼加拉瓜运送军火，并且在去年和尼加拉瓜的索摩查政府签订了一项所谓“军事援助条约”。更值得注意的是，据美洲的一些报纸指出，参加这次侵略哥斯达黎加的干涉军的很多人，也就是参加了去年对危地马拉的武装干涉的那些人。因此，不难看出，这是美国侵略集团对美洲国家所施行的又一次武装干涉手段。
    在危地马拉事件发生前后，中南美洲的国家中已经发生了许多事情。美国驻巴拉圭的大使馆曾参与了一次巴拉圭的政变，推翻了原来的总统查维斯，而由一个亲美的军事法西斯分子佩雷伊拉担任了总统。在这之后，美国垄断资本势力又逼使巴西总统瓦加斯自杀，而由菲洛继任总统，来执行血腥的镇压政策，以摧毁一切对美国把巴西殖民地化的反抗。美国对危地马拉、巴拉圭、巴西和哥斯达黎加所策动的这一系列的颠覆、政变和武装干涉的侵略活动，清楚地说明了一个事实，那就是美国侵略集团绝不容许中南美洲国家有丝毫独立自主的权利。美国侵略集团不惜用尽一切手段，在中南美洲的国家中扶植起对他们千依百顺的军事独裁政权，以便把美洲各国人民踩在脚下，使他们能够任所欲为地加以奴役。这就是美国新的殖民主义者的真正面目。
    美国侵略集团这种颠覆其他国家政府、奴役其他国家人民的殖民主义政策，不仅是在中南美洲肆无忌惮地推行，而且也妄图强加在世界其他各处人民的头上。美国侵略集团侵占我国领土台湾、扶植蒋介石卖国集团进攻我国大陆的罪恶行为，也就是妄想颠覆我国政府、奴役我国人民。美国在东南亚所建立的军事侵略集团，也是赤裸裸的要在东南亚建立美国的新殖民主义统治。最近，印度尼西亚揭露出来的美国的资助南摩鹿加叛乱分子的事件，同样是美国在印度尼西亚进行颠覆活动的证明。据叛乱分子的高级军官威廉·曼赫罗的供认，驻印度尼西亚的美国大使馆不但曾供给叛乱分子以金钱，并且还曾用美国大使馆的飞机对叛乱分子进行过空投。
    事实很清楚，美国侵略集团为建立它的世界霸权而在世界各处推行的新的殖民主义战争政策，是世界各国遭受威胁和不安的根源。美国所策动的对哥斯达黎加的武装干涉，造成了对美洲国家的安全的威胁。美洲国家舆论严厉斥责美国的侵略行为。乌拉圭的“辩论报”指出：“用不着说明就可以知道，是谁造成中美洲的混乱状态，是谁策划和导致这一地区几乎连年不断的动荡局面”。同样的，美国在亚洲、欧洲和世界其他各处建立军事侵略集团的新的殖民主义战争计划，也使新战争的危机大大增加了。这是全世界爱好和平人民不能忽视的。
    美洲各国人民和全世界爱好和平人民曾一致斥责了美国对危地马拉的侵略行为，现在他们正以同样的正义立场来反对美国对哥斯达黎加的武装干涉。我们中国人民不仅关心自己国家的独立和安全，也关心其他国家的独立和安全。我们坚决反对美国对哥斯达黎加的武装侵略。我们相信，全世界的正义舆论都会同情哥斯达黎加人民的。
