    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 21st: The "Neues Deutschland" published on the 20th a letter of appeal, signed by Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, calling on the leadership of the West German Social Democratic Party and all members of the Social Democratic Party, the Executive Committee of the West German Trade Union Federation and its affiliated trade union members, as well as all members of the Catholic workers' movement, to take joint action against the rearmament of West Germany.
    The appeal pointed out that the time is fast approaching for the Bonn Bundestag to make a decision on whether to approve the Paris Accords. Through united action, the German working class is much stronger than a handful of Konzern and bank bosses, as well as militarists. The seriousness of the situation demands that the working class take courageous action to strive for a turning point in Germany that favors the cause of unity, peace, and democracy.
    The appeal suggests the following unified actions to the leadership of the West German Social Democratic Party and the Executive Committee of the West German Trade Union Federation: (1) Jointly hold mass rallies in West Germany, Berlin, and the German Democratic Republic against the ratification and implementation of the Paris Accords, demanding the restoration of German unity, the conclusion of a peace treaty, and an understanding among all European countries on collective security in Europe; (2) Hold a national referendum against the Paris Accords and demanding the unification of Germany into a peaceful and democratic state; (3) Discuss joint measures to prepare for free all-German elections in 1955; (4) Discuss issues related to the establishment of a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany.
    Before the Socialist Unity Party of Germany put forward this proposal, the West German Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany and the Free German Trade Union Federation had separately suggested to the Central Committee of the West German Social Democratic Party and the West German Trade Union Federation to take unified action to strive for the restoration of German unity and against the Paris Accords. The Hamburg organization of the Social Democratic Party and the youth committee of the Karlsruhe trade union had also successively made such demands to their upper-level leadership.
    Xinhua News Agency, January 21st: According to TASS, London: Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, speaking at a mass rally in Sheffield on the 19th, demanded a referendum on the issue of arming West Germany. He said: "The result of the vote is predictable: the vast majority of the people would express opposition to arming Germany, and in other words, the vast majority of the people demand that British foreign policy be based on peace, not on war preparations."
    Pollitt emphasized that the foreign policy of reviving German militarism pursued by Britain is breeding the same consequences as Chamberlain's Munich policy. He also said: "Without any consultation with Parliament, Eden has promised to keep 120,000 British youth stationed on the European continent for the next forty-four years, and to pay 150 million pounds each year to woo France and force France to agree to arm West Germany."

    德国统一社会党向西德社会民主党和工会发出呼吁书
    要求采取共同行动反对重新武装西德
    波立特要求就武装西德问题举行公民投票
    【新华社柏林二十一日电】“新德意志报”二十日刊载了由德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希签署的一封呼吁书，呼吁西德社会民主党领导机构和社会民主党全体党员、西德工会联合会执行委员会和它所属的工会会员以及天主教工人运动的所有会员采取共同行动，反对重新武装西德。
    呼吁书指出，距离波恩联邦议院就是否批准巴黎协定采取决定的时间已经很短了。只要统一行动，德国工人阶级是比一小撮的康采恩和银行老板以及军国主义者强大得多。情势的严重性首先要求工人阶级勇敢行动，争取在德国出现一个有利于统一、和平和民主事业的转折点。
    呼吁书向西德社会民主党领导机构和西德工会联合会执行委员会建议采取下列统一行动：（一）在西德、柏林和德意志民主共和国联合举行群众大会，反对批准和实施巴黎协定，要求恢复德国统一，要求缔结和约，要求全欧国家就欧洲的集体安全取得谅解；（二）举行反对巴黎协定和要求把德国统一成为一个和平、民主国家的全民投票；（三）商讨筹备在一九五五年举行全德自由选举的共同措施；（四）商讨有关建立一个统一的、民主的、爱好和平的德国的各项问题。
    在德国统一社会党提出这次建议以前，民主德国全国阵线西德委员会和自由德国工会联合会曾经分别建议西德社会民主党中央委员会和西德工会联合会，就争取恢复德国的统一和反对巴黎协定采取统一行动。社会民主党汉堡组织和加尔斯卢合的工会青年委员会也曾经先后向他们的上层领导提出这种要求。
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国共产党总书记波立特十九日在设菲尔德群众大会上讲话，要求就武装西德问题举行公民投票。他说：“投票结果是可以预料到的：绝大多数人民会表示反对武装德国，换句话说，绝大多数人民要求英国外交政策以和平为基础，而不是以战争准备为基础。”
    波立特着重指出：英国所奉行的复活德国军国主义的外交政策，孕育着张伯伦的慕尼黑政策的同样后果。他又说：“艾登没有和议会进行任何磋商，就答应了使十二万英国青年在今后四十四年中留驻欧洲大陆，为此每年还要支付一亿五千万英镑，以便拉拢法国和强迫法国同意武装西德。”
