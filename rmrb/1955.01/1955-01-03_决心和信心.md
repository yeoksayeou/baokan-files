    Determination and Confidence
    Lü Hongbin, Representative of the National People's Congress, Director of the Patriotic Agricultural Production Cooperative, Ju County, Shandong Province
    Looking back on the road I've traveled in the past year, I am so happy. Under the leadership and assistance of the Party and the government, our cooperative has been further consolidated and improved. Although we suffered from severe natural disasters last year, we still harvested an average of 404.8 jin per mu on 1,255 mu of land, an increase of 74 jin compared to the previous year, and more than 20 percent more than ordinary mutual aid teams. More than ten kinds of sideline businesses also generated an income of over 22 million yuan.
    With the increase in production, 109 out of the 116 households in the cooperative increased their income. Only six households of elderly and widowed people and one household lacking labor reduced production, but their living standards were no lower than those of ordinary members. More than 80 percent of the households in the cooperative sold more than 150,000 jin of surplus grain (including wheat). Tian Zhongting and Ma Yi, who used to have their public grain reduced or exempted every year and relied on government relief, also sold more than 700 jin of surplus grain this year to support the socialist construction of the motherland.
    How did our cooperative increase production? All members of the cooperative clearly know that we should first thank the leadership and assistance of the Party and the People's Government. The county party committee and the technical guidance station provided patient and specific guidance to our production; the government provided loans of more than 42 million yuan; we bought 239 pieces of farming tools such as weeding hoes and 10,561 jin of chemical fertilizers; the worker brothers of the chemical plant also gave us 150 jin of "666." These things helped our cooperative to carry out deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, improve management, overcome natural disasters such as insects and drought, and achieve a bumper harvest.
    As our great motherland enters the third year of the First Five-Year Plan, the socialist construction of the motherland has given us new glorious tasks. I will lead the members of the cooperative to do a good job in the production of 1955 with the greatest effort and determination. Our preliminary plan is to produce 655,580 jin of grain on 1,335 mu of land, requiring an average yield of 491 jin per mu, an increase of 21 percent over 1954. We have also decided to expand the planting area of commercial grain and cash crops. In terms of sideline production, we plan to double the number of hogs raised, increase the number of breeding livestock by six, increase the planting of fruit trees by 4,000, and set up a small nursery in fourteen kinds of sideline businesses.
    Now all of our members are enthusiastically engaged in winter production to prepare for this year's production. Our slogan is: To complete and overfulfill the 1955 production increase plan, and strive to support the socialist construction of the motherland and liberate Taiwan with 270,000 jin of surplus grain and 25,000 jin of cotton and hemp!

    决心和信心
    全国人民代表大会代表山东莒县爱国农业生产合作社社长  吕鸿宾
    回忆过去一年走过的路，俺是多么高兴呵。一年来在党和政府的领导帮助下，俺社又得到了进一步的巩固和提高。去年虽然遭受了严重的自然灾害，可是在一千二百五十五亩土地上，每亩平均还收获了四百零四斤八两，比前年增产七十四斤，比一般互助组增产百分之二十以上。十多种副业也收入了两千二百多万元。
    产量提高了，全社一一六户社员中，有一百零九户都增加了收入。仅有六户孤寡和一户缺劳力户减了产，但是他们的生活也不低于一般社员。全社百分之八十以上的户出卖了余粮十五万余斤（连麦子在内）。年年减免公粮、依靠政府救济的田中廷、马易这一年也卖了余粮七百多斤，支援祖国社会主义建设。
    俺社是怎样增产的呢？全体社员都清楚地知道：首先应该感谢党和人民政府的领导和帮助。县委和技术指导站对我们的生产进行了耐心的具体指导；政府给贷款四千二百多万元；我们买到耘锄等农具二百三十九件，化学肥料一万零五百六十一斤；化工厂的工人弟兄们还赠给我们“六六六”一百五十斤。这些东西帮助俺社进行了深耕细作，改善了经营管理，战胜了虫、旱等自然灾害，取得了丰收。
    在我们伟大的祖国进入第一个五年计划的第三年的时候，祖国的社会主义建设又交给我们新的光荣任务。俺要带领社员，用最大的努力和决心，搞好一九五五年的生产。我们初步计划：在一千三百三十五亩土地上生产六十五万五千五百八十斤粮食，要求每亩平均产四百九十一斤，比一九五四年增产百分之二十一。我们还决定扩大商品粮和经济作物的种植面积。副业方面，准备在十四种副业中，增养毛猪一倍、种畜六头，增植果树四千棵，设小苗圃一处。
    现在我们全体社员正热火朝天地投入冬季生产，为今年的生产作好准备。我们的口号是，为完成和超额完成一九五五年的增产计划，把余粮二十七万斤、棉麻二万五千斤，支援祖国社会主义建设和解放台湾而奋斗！
