    A Modernized Underground Factory

    On the north bank of the Taizi River in Benxi, stands an orange-red headframe, surrounded by buildings. This is the Caitun Shaft, which was officially put into production on December 15, 1954.

    Now, people can take a cage from the wellhead down to the bottom of the shaft, 500 meters below the surface, and see interconnected roadways and crisscrossing trolley tracks, with mine cars shuttling back and forth. Countless electric lights illuminate the tunnels, spanning dozens of miles, like a brightly lit underground city. Here, miners only need to operate pneumatic drills to strip the coal into the coal lanes. The coal will then flow along conveyor belts into coal bunkers, from the bunkers into coal cars, which are pulled by electric locomotives to tippler stations, tipped onto conveyor belts, sent to large coal bunkers, flow into skips, and hoisted by skips to the wellhead, where it is dumped onto conveyor belts that lead directly to the coal washing plant. These extremely heavy operations are all replaced by machinery. Workers only need to sit on the driver's seat or stand next to the machine, press a button or move a valve, and these electric and pneumatic mechanical devices will operate skillfully and automatically. Amidst the rushing sound of mine cars and the whirring of pneumatic drills, coal flows continuously along the conveyor belt, like a river of black gold.

    Here, the biggest natural disasters threatening coal mine production—water, fire, and gas—are strictly controlled and prevented. The underground is equipped with large water pumps that can drain more than five tons of water per minute and giant ventilators that can extract 17,000 cubic meters of air per minute, ensuring fresh air underground. All kinds of electrical and mechanical equipment have explosion-proof devices, preventing sparks from being generated due to electrical faults. Areas with high coal dust levels have sprinklers, like fine rain, preventing coal dust from flying around. The mining areas have rock dust sheds, which can dilute the gas in the air and prevent gas explosions. The chambers where the main electrical and mechanical equipment are installed have protective gates, preventing any water or fire from encroaching. In addition, there are new-style sun lamp rooms, large shower rooms, and medical clinics. All of these create good working conditions for the miners.

    In the past, Japanese invaders, in order to plunder more of Benxi's low-phosphorus, low-sulfur high-quality coking coal, began to excavate the Caitun Shaft in September 1938. However, by the time of the Northeast's liberation, they had only completed the main shaft and over 7,000 meters of rock tunnels underground. There was no mechanical equipment whatsoever underground. To hinder our own construction of the shaft, they burned all the geological data and drawings before leaving. When the Kuomintang reactionaries ruled Benxi, they dismantled the canopies, doors, windows, and floors of all the buildings above ground and stole and sold valuable parts. After the liberation of Benxi, the Caitun Shaft was flooded, with groundwater rising to half the height of the shaft and many tunnels at the bottom collapsing. This created great difficulties for the continued construction of the shaft.

    However, thanks to the selfless labor of all the shaft construction workers and the sincere help of Soviet experts, the Caitun Shaft, after only four years of restoration and construction, has become a modernized underground factory. After this underground factory is put into production, its annual output will not only supply Benxi's iron smelting needs, but also supply the iron smelting needs of other regions, which will play a significant role in supporting national industrial construction.

    一座近代化的地下工厂
    在本溪的太子河北岸，耸立着一个橘红色的井塔，井塔的周围是一片楼房。这就是在一九五四年十二月十五日已经正式投入生产的彩屯竖井。
    现在，人们从井口乘罐降到离地面有五百公尺深的井底，就可看到四通八达的巷道和纵横交错的电车道，矿车像穿梭似的来来往往。一盏接一盏数不完的电灯，把方圆数十里的坑道照耀得像一座灯火辉煌的地下城。在这里矿工们只要操纵着风镐把煤剥落到煤巷里，煤就会顺着传送皮带进入煤仓，由煤仓流入煤车，由电车拉到翻车场，翻入传送带，送到大煤仓，流入箕斗，由箕斗提升到井口，倒入传送带上一直向洗煤厂流去。这许多极为繁重的操作都由机械代替，工人们只要坐在司机台上，或站在机器旁边，按一下电钮或搬一下风门，这些电动和风动的机械设备即会灵巧地自动操作。在矿车的飞奔声和风镐的嘟嘟声里，只见煤在顺着传送带连接不断地流，流成像一条乌金似的河流。
    在这里对威胁煤矿生产最大的自然灾害—水、火、瓦斯都被严格地管制和防范着。在井下设有每分钟即能排水五吨多的大水泵和每分钟能够抽风一万七千立方公尺的巨型扇风机，井下空气十分新鲜。各种电气机械设备都有防爆装置，根本不会因电气故障而冒出火花。煤尘大的方地都有喷水器，像落毛毛雨一样，使煤尘不能飞扬。采煤区内有岩粉棚子，它能冲淡空气中的瓦斯和防止瓦斯爆炸，安装着主要电气机械设备的洞室，都有防护闸门，丝毫遭不到水、火的侵袭。此外还有新式的太阳灯室，大淋浴室，医务所等。这些都给矿工们创造了良好的劳动条件。
    在过去，日本强盗为了更多地掠夺本溪低磷、低硫的优质炼焦煤，在一九三八年九月曾着手开凿彩屯竖井。可是到东北光复，还只是开凿完一个主井井筒和井下七千多公尺的岩石巷道，井下更是什么机械设备也没有的，但它为了阻碍我们自己对竖井的建设，临走时烧毁了所有的地质资料和图纸。国民党反动派统治本溪时，又拆毁了井上所有建筑物上的天棚、门窗和地板，盗卖了贵重机件。到本溪解放以后，彩屯竖井已被淹在水里，地下水涨到了井筒的一半，井底很多的巷道也坍塌崩落了。这样便给继续建设竖井留下了很大困难。
    但是，由于全体建井职工们的忘我劳动和苏联专家的真诚帮助，彩屯竖井只经过四年的恢复和建设，它已经成为一座近代化的地下工厂了。这座地下工厂移交生产以后，它的年产量不仅供应本溪炼铁需要，而且还要供应外地的炼铁需要，这对支援国家工业建设将起重大作用。
