Heilongjiang Province has eliminated forest fires.

Heilongjiang Province is a major forest area in China, with approximately twenty million hectares of forest distributed in the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains and the Wanda Mountains. Currently, these forest areas have successively received more than five inches of heavy snow, and the forest fire prevention work has basically ended. During the autumn forest fire prevention period from early September to early December last year, except for wildfires that occurred on the grasslands of Muleng, Baoqing and other places, which were promptly extinguished by local people, no forest fires occurred in the entire province. The elimination of forest fires not only ensures the safety of forest resources, but also saves a lot of manpower and material resources, enabling various production tasks to proceed smoothly.

    黑龙江省杜绝了山林火灾
    黑龙江省是我国主要林区，分布在大、小兴安岭和完达山脉的森林面积约有二千多万公顷。目前这些林区已先后降落了五寸多厚的白雪，护林防火工作已基本结束。在去年九月初到十二月上旬的秋季护林防火期间，除穆棱、宝清等地荒草原上曾发生过野火并及时被当地群众扑灭外，全省没有发生过一次山林火灾。山林火灾的杜绝，不但保证了森林资源的安全，也节省了很多人力物力，使各种生产工作都能顺利进行。　（杨枢）
