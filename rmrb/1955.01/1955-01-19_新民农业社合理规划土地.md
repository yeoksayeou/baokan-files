    Xinmin Agricultural Cooperative Rationally Plans Land
    The Xinmin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xinfan County, Sichuan Province, has unified and rationally planned its land, facilitating the use of new-style animal-powered farm implements and expanding the cultivated area. Originally, the cooperative had 941 scattered small plots, making irrigation and cultivation inconvenient. After rational planning and merging, these have now been transformed into 108 mu of large-area fields, the largest of which is 40 mu. By removing more than 1,300 small field ridges and filling in 33 small ditches, the cooperative has newly expanded its land by 66 mu, reaching 5 percent of the original cultivated area. Now, the vast fields are covered with lush green spring crops. (Our Sichuan Reporter Station)

    新民农业社合理规划土地
    四川省新繁县新民农业生产合作社，统一合理规划土地，便利了新式畜力农具耕作，还扩大了耕地面积。原来全社有九百四十一块分散的小田，灌溉、耕作都不方便，经合理规划相互合并后，如今改变成为一百零八亩的大面积田，最大的每块达四十亩。由于铲除了一千三百多条小田坎，填平了三十三条小水沟，全社新扩大了六十六亩土地，达原有耕地面积的百分之五。如今广阔的田野里，长满一片嫩绿的小春作物。　（本报四川记者站）
