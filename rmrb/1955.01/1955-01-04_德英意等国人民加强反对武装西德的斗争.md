    Xinhua News Agency, January 3rd: Berlin dispatch: People from all walks of life in Germany are continuing to launch a movement against the revival of the German "Wehrmacht" amid increasingly indignant sentiments.

    Herbert Warnke, Chairman of the Free German Trade Union Federation, wrote to the West German Trade Union Federation, requesting that the two trade union organizations conduct a joint struggle against the ratification and implementation of the Paris Accords on arming West Germany. People's representatives from all walks of life in the German Democratic Republic and West Germany have also written letters and telegrams to members of the Bonn Bundestag, urging them to reject the Paris military agreements.

    Five thousand residents of Schwerin in the German Democratic Republic held a mass rally against the revival of German militarism and against war preparations. The meeting telegraphed the Central Committee of the German Social Democratic Party, asking the German Social Democratic Party to support its members' speeches in the Bundestag against ratification of the Paris Accords with practical actions - launching a struggle outside the parliament.

    Young people in the German Democratic Republic and West Germany are particularly active in the struggle against West German re-militarization. Recently, young men and women in various districts of Berlin held a conference attended by representatives from West Germany, as well as representatives from youth organizations in Poland and Czechoslovakia. Modrow, the First Secretary of the Free German Youth League Berlin Organization, called on all German youth at the meeting to launch a struggle against the Paris military agreements. On behalf of the German youth, he assured the Polish and Czechoslovak youth that the German youth would fight to the end.

    Young people in Bremerhaven, West Germany, held a demonstration in storms and heavy rain to protest against the plan to rebuild the "Wehrmacht." They shouted slogans: "We don't want to be mercenaries." "We don't want American weapons, we want peace!"

    Participants in the First and Second World Wars in Ham, West Germany, joined forces with youth representatives from Ham and the suburbs to hold a meeting at which an organization refusing military service was established.

    The appeal by the famous German poet Bertolt Brecht against the Paris military agreements has received great support from German intellectuals. Currently, 3,900 representatives of well-known German scientists, writers, artistic activists, musicians, educators, and technical intellectuals have signed this appeal.

    Local organizations of food industry trade unions in Worms (West Germany) and Wedenberg (German Democratic Republic) jointly distributed leaflets against the Paris Accords and against the illegal trials aimed at outlawing the German Communist Party.

    Karl Arnold, Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia (where the Ruhr industrial area is located), West Germany, pointed out in an article published in the "Ruhr News": The workers and staff in the Ruhr "firmly oppose turning the Ruhr into an arsenal of the atomic age." The people of North Rhine-Westphalia support the views of the Ruhr workers.

    Xinhua News Agency, January 3rd: According to TASS, people in Britain and Italy are continuing to fight against arming West Germany.

    The London Cooperative Society Alliance, which has one million members, issued a statement saying that it intends to submit a proposal at the upcoming annual meeting of the British Cooperative Society Alliance recommending condemnation of the London and Paris Accords and support for the West German trade unions that oppose these accords.

    The London Cooperative Society Alliance advocates holding Four Power negotiations before the Paris Accords are ratified, and that the German Democratic Republic and West Germany should send representatives to this meeting. The organization believes that "a treaty on collective security for all of Europe needs to be considered, which could replace the currently mutually opposed military alliances in Europe."

    Throughout Italy, peace committees are distributing a large number of leaflets calling on the people to oppose the revival of German militarism. In recent days, more than 400 rallies and seminars against arming West Germany have been held in Bologna alone. In many cities such as Livorno, Florence, and Como, the struggle against arming West Germany is also growing stronger.

    Many citizens of Torre Annunziata in the province of Naples have signed petitions against arming West Germany and demanding the establishment of a pan-European collective security system. The Villamarzana Municipal Council, composed of Communists, Socialists, Social Democrats, Christian Democrats, and Liberals, unanimously passed a resolution opposing the rearmament of West Germany. The Pesaro Municipal Council passed a resolution by a large majority opposing the establishment of the "Western European Union."

    Workers in many factories in Milan sent delegations to Rome to protest the arming of West Germany to the parliament. Residents of Città di Castello in the province of Perugia and Ravenna demanded that the Upper House reject the Paris Accords.
