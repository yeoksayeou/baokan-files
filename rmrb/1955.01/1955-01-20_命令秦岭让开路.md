　　Ordering the Qinling Mountains to Give Way
　　What is this sound, startling the sleeping Qinling Mountains?
　　Eagles hide in the clouds, tigers flee to the forest,
　　The Qinling Mountains shake their white hair,
　　　　—shaking the white clouds in the blue sky.
　　It’s our heroes returning from Korea,
　　Ready to use dynamite to blast through the Qinling Mountains,
　　Ordering the Qinling Mountains to give way,
　　The train must pass through this myriad of mountains.
　　The Qinling Mountains are enraged,
　　Clouds rise from the peaks;
　　In March, heavy snow falls,
　　Green pines turn into silver trees;
　　In April, a hurricane blows,
　　Uprooting even large trees;
　　In May and June, heavy thunderstorms,
　　The clear, bright sky turns dark;
　　In July and August, mountain floods come from the sky,
　　The mountains are high, the water is high, the great flood inundates the valley.
　　Fear not that the Qinling Mountains are so angry they’ll break the sky with their heads,
　　Our heroes are opening the mountains day and night.
　　Our heroes have returned from Korea,
　　At that time, the ground was frozen three feet deep, fearing not the cold,
　　Summer rainstorms and autumn floods,
　　And enemy planes dropping bombs day and night,
　　They could cut off the eastward flowing river,
　　But they could not cut off the steel transport line,
　　Laying tracks as though upon a knife edge,
　　The hero's blood was shed in Korea.
　　Now we must break through the Qinling Mountains,
　　And one day we will break through the Himalayas.
　　If there are deep valleys, we will move mountains to fill them;
　　If there are great rivers, we will build iron bridges;
　　If there are high mountains, towering into the clouds,
　　Fear not the highest mountain of the Qinling range,
　　Even if the mountains are high, the train will still pass through the tunnel.
　　Fear not if the mountain collapses or the tunnel caves in,
　　Rows of large trees prop up the frame;
　　Fear not if the tunnel is flooded by springs,
　　A large number of water pumps are set up;
　　Fear not if the air in the tunnel is stagnant,
　　Fans create a great wind from the ground;
　　Fear not if you can't see in the tunnel,
　　Electric lights turn the night into day!
　　Some say Pangu created the heavens and the earth,
　　Pangu has only appeared today.
　　The Qinling Mountains are sighing,
　　The rain—like flowing tears,
　　The clouds—frowning.
　　Looking east, railways climb everywhere,
　　Looking west, the Qinling Mountains are amazed:
　　The railway passes through the Wushaoling Mountains,
　　And goes straight to the vast Gobi Desert,
　　Looking into the distance, the Tianshan Mountains reveal their snowy peaks,
　　The Tianshan Mountains are so frightened that they hide in the dark clouds.
　　The Himalayas are in the sky,
　　The Bayan Har Mountains are ladders to heaven,
　　All shouting loudly towards the Qinling Mountains,
　　The wind sends the shouts thousands of miles:
　　"Before the heroic people,
　　Why don't you quickly lower your head!"

    命令秦岭让开路
    戈壁舟这是什么声音，把熟睡的秦岭惊醒？飞鹰躲进云里，猛虎逃往森林，秦岭摇着白发，——摇着蓝天上的白云。是咱朝鲜回来的英雄，要用炸药把秦岭炸通，命令秦岭让开路，火车要通过这万山丛中。秦岭发了怒，山峰上冒起云雾；三月下大雪，青松变成银树；四月刮飓风，大树树根都拔出土；五、六月大雷雨，清格朗朗的天脸色变乌；七、八月山洪天上来，山高水高大水漫山谷。不怕你秦岭气得用头碰破天，咱们英雄日日夜夜在开山。咱们英雄是从朝鲜回，那时候，地冻三尺不怕寒，夏天雷雨秋天发洪水，还有敌机日夜扔炸弹，它能炸断大江东流水，却炸不断钢铁运输线，刀口上一样铺铁轨，英雄的鲜血洒在朝鲜。现在要打通秦岭，有天要打通喜马拉雅山。是深谷，移山来填平；是大河，铁桥要架成；是那高山呵，重重高山高入云，不怕你秦岭的最高山，高山开洞火车照样行。不怕你山崩洞垮，成排的大树支起架；不怕你洞里泉水淹，抽水机摆了一大摊；不怕你洞里空气不通，扇风机平地里刮起大风；不怕你洞里看不见，电灯光把黑夜变成大白天！说啥开天辟地是盘古王，盘古王今天才出现。秦岭在叹气，雨——像是淌眼泪，云——皱起了眉。看东面，铁路到处爬，望西边，秦岭好惊奇：铁路穿过乌鞘岭，端端地走向大戈壁，远望天山露雪顶，天山吓得躲在乌云里。喜马拉雅山在天里面，巴颜喀喇山是上天梯，都朝着秦岭高声喊，风送喊声千万里：“你在英雄人民的面前，还不赶快把头低！”
