Response from the Paper Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry regarding the proposal to recycle waste paper:

The Paper Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry has received suggestions from people in various regions regarding the recycling and utilization of waste paper. Our comprehensive response is as follows:

Utilizing discarded newspapers, books, periodicals, materials, forms, and registers from various government agencies, schools, and organizations to make new paper can not only solve the problem of supplying some paper-making raw materials, but also has lower costs and is easier to process in the production process. It is estimated that the country can collect 20,000 to 25,000 tons of various types of waste paper annually, which can produce 16,000 to 20,000 tons of pulp and 14,400 to 18,000 tons of paper. Therefore, the work of recycling waste paper is of great significance for increasing national wealth and rationally utilizing resources.

Currently, state-owned and local state-owned paper mills in Beijing, Shanghai, and some areas of Northeast China are already collecting and utilizing waste paper. However, the sources of waste paper are scattered, the amounts are small, and the quality varies. There are some difficulties in collection, storage, and transportation. Moreover, it can generally only be used to manufacture low-grade paper such as packaging paper, roofing felt base paper, and white cardboard filling. The equipment conditions and production tasks of paper mills in various regions are different, and waste paper cannot be universally used as raw material. In addition, waste paper is relatively light in weight, and long-distance transportation will not only increase paper-making costs but also waste national transportation capacity. Due to the above reasons, the work of recycling and utilizing waste paper has not been universally carried out nationwide, and all available waste paper cannot be collected and used.

In order to save national wealth, our bureau will try to consider expanding the number of factories using waste paper and increasing the amount of waste paper used in future production plans. The industrial administrative departments of various provinces should also designate fixed paper mills to collect and utilize local waste paper based on the principle of using local materials.

    轻工业部造纸工业管理局对建议回收废纸问题的答复
    轻工业部造纸工业管理局来信：我局时常接到各地人民建议回收废纸，加以利用，综合答复如下：
    利用各机关、学校、团体作废的报纸、书刊、资料、表单、簿册等重做新纸，不仅可以解决部分造纸原料的供应问题，而且成本较低，在生产过程中处理也较容易。据估计，全国每年可以收购各种废纸两万吨到两万五千吨，能产纸浆一万六千吨到两万吨，能抄造纸张一万四千四百吨到一万八千吨。因此，回收废纸的工作，对于增加国家财富，合理地利用资源是有重大意义的。
    目前，北京、上海和东北某些地区已有国营和地方国营的造纸厂收购、利用废纸。但是，废纸来源分散，数目零星，质量不同，在收购、保管和运输工作上都有一些困难，而且一般只能用来制造包装纸、油毡原纸和白版纸夹心等低级纸张；各地造纸厂设备条件和生产任务不同，不能普遍用废纸作原料；再加上废纸体质较轻，如果长途运输，不仅加大造纸成本，而且还浪费国家运输力。由于以上原因，废纸回收利用工作还没有在全国范围内普遍开展，可以利用的废纸还不能全部收购使用。
    为了节约国家财富，我局今后在生产计划中要尽量考虑扩大废纸的使用厂和增加废纸的使用量，各省工业行政部门也应该根据就地取材的原则，指定固定纸厂收购和利用当地的废纸。
