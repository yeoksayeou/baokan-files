A serious incident of suppressing criticism occurred at the Fuxian Department Store in Liaoning Province, resulting in a female salesclerk, Tan Guiying, being driven to attempt suicide (she was rescued and survived). The incident unfolded as follows:

On June 22nd of last year, the Supervisory Office of the Liaoning Provincial People's Government's Department of Commerce received a letter from Pan Shiwen (anonymous) of the Second Sales Department of the Fuxian Department Store, alleging that the director of the department, Lin Yongxiu (female), exhibited bureaucratism and lacked a democratic work style. On June 26th, the Supervisory Office of the Department of Commerce forwarded the letter to the Industry and Commerce Section of the Fuxian People's Government for investigation and handling. On June 29th, the section instructed section member Yu Jichang to be responsible for handling the letter, while emphasizing the need to maintain confidentiality. On July 15th of last year, Yu Jichang took the letter to the Department Store and discussed handling it with Deputy Manager Yu Xuebin. Because there had been previous anonymous letters reflecting on Lin Yongxiu's relationships with men and women, which after investigation proved to be untrue, Yu Xuebin said before even finishing reading the letter: "The content of the allegations is not true, it is fabricated and an attack on the leadership." He also said: "A few of them (referring to the letter writer) are making trouble inside, find out who they are and deal with them." Thus, Yu Xuebin dispatched Song Jingsheng, the head of the company's personnel section, to investigate. Song Jingsheng was also dissatisfied with the letter writer, and influenced by Yu Xuebin's bad attitude, he and Yu Jichang disregarded the issues raised in the letter and only actively pursued the writer of the letter. Later, Yu Jichang went out on official business, and Song Jingsheng and the original director of the Second Sales Department, Gong Mingyue, continued the investigation. They adopted terrible methods such as comparing handwriting from notebooks and inciting employees to make guesses. On July 24th, Song Jingsheng "confirmed" that the anonymous letter was written by Tan Guiying, a salesclerk in the knitwear group of the department. He then talked to Tan Guiying, but Tan Guiying consistently denied it. Song Jingsheng became furious and argued with Tan Guiying. At this time, Gong Mingyue wrote a "certificate" and mobilized employees: "Whoever says that Tan Guiying wrote it, put your seal on the paper." Due to his "mobilization," seven salesclerks stamped their seals. Tan Guiying felt wronged and burst into tears. Song Jingsheng sternly rebuked her, and at the same time, holding the stamped "certificate," he said to her: "Based on this, we can deal with you, what can you do!" Tan Guiying asked to see the letter, and said: "I don't know what the letter says, after I read it, whether good or bad, I will understand." Song Jingsheng said even more sternly: "What qualifications do you have to see the material (referring to the letter), what good or bad can happen to you? What can you do if you die! Isn't it enough for me, the head of the personnel section, to pay for your life? A few years in court is enough!" Song Jingsheng and others relentlessly pursued, satirized, and abused Tan Guiying, finally causing Tan Guiying to feel that the matter was very serious. Therefore, after work that evening, while everyone was eating, she ran behind the department and threw herself into a well to commit suicide. Fortunately, she was discovered by the masses and rescued.

This incident has had a very bad impact on the local masses. The employees of the Fuxian Department Store are even more afraid to raise any opinions. Afterwards, the Fuxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Fuxian People's Government's handling of this incident was: Song Jingsheng, the head of the company's personnel section, was given the punishment of removal from his Party post and administrative demotion; Deputy Manager Yu Xuebin was given a Party warning and required to make a self-criticism at the employee meeting; other relevant personnel were also dealt with.

    复县百货公司发生严重压制批评事件
    辽宁省复县百货公司发生严重压制批评事件，女营业员谭桂英被逼自杀（遇救未死）。事件经过如下。
    辽宁省人民政府商业厅监察室去年六月二十二日接到复县百货公司第二门市部署名潘士文（匿名）的来信，揭发该门市部主任林永秀（女）有官僚主义、民主作风不够等问题。商业厅监察室于六月二十六日把来信转交该县人民政府工商科检查处理。六月二十九日该科责成科员于继昌负责处理那封来信，同时指出须注意保密。去年七月十五日，于继昌持信到百货公司和副经理于学斌研究处理。因为过去曾经有人匿名来信反映林永秀的男女关系问题，经调查不是事实，所以于学斌还没有把信看完就说：“所揭发的内容不真实，是捏造事实攻击领导。”并且说：“他们几个（指来信人）在里面捣鬼，弄清楚就处理他们。”于是于学斌就派该公司人事股长宋景生追查。宋景生对来信人也不满意，加上于学斌的恶劣态度的影响，他和于继昌对那件来信所揭发的问题就抛开不管，而只积极地去追查写信人。后来于继昌因公外出，宋景生又和第二门市部原主任宫明悦继续追查。他们采取对照笔记簿字体、发动职工猜疑等恶劣办法进行追查。七月二十四日宋景生“确定”了那件匿名信是该门市部针织组营业员谭桂英写的，他就找谭桂英谈话。但谭桂英始终不承认。宋景生就大发脾气，并和谭桂英吵起来。这时宫明悦写一“证明书”发动职工：“你们谁说是谭桂英写的，在纸上盖章。”由于他的“发动”，有七个营业员盖了章。谭桂英感到冤枉，大哭起来，宋景生就声严色厉地申斥她，同时拿着那盖了章的“证明书”对她说：“根据这个，就可以处理你，你能怎的！”谭桂英要求看信，并说：“我不知道那信写些什么，我看了以后有个好歹我也明白。”宋景生更严厉地说：“你有什么资格看材料（指那封信），你有什么好歹？你死了能怎的！有我人事股长还不够给你偿命吗？蹲几年法院够了！”宋景生等这样一步紧一步地追逼，讽刺，恶骂，终于使谭桂英感到事情很严重，于是在当天晚间下班后趁大家吃饭的时候，就跑到该门市部后面投井自杀，幸被群众发现，救出未死。
    这一事件在当地群众中造成了极坏的影响。复县百货公司的职工有什么意见，也更加不敢提出。以后中共复县县委会和复县人民政府对这一事件的处理是：给该公司人事股长宋景生以党内撤销工作和行政降职的处分；给副经理于学斌以党内劝告和在职工大会上作检讨的处分；对其他有关人员也作了处理。　（商业部监察室报道组）
