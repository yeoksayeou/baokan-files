The capital's various circles held mass rallies
In recent days, thousands of mass rallies have been held in the capital to oppose the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty." More than 150,000 people from the Qianmen, Xidan, and Dongsi districts participated in various rallies. Many rallies passed resolutions to support the liberation of Taiwan with practical actions. Employees of the Beijing People's Machinery Factory proposed at a general employee meeting to ensure normal attendance during the Spring Festival and complete 22 percent of the annual plan in the first quarter of 1955 to support the struggle to liberate Taiwan. Employees of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Plant put forward plans to increase pig iron and new agricultural implements, respectively, to oppose the US-Chiang treaty. All members of the Huangtugang Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fengtai District proposed to increase production by 15 to 20 percent in 1955, expand the planting area of cash crops, and sell large quantities of peanuts and beans to the state to support the liberation of Taiwan. On December 31 of last year, the China Islamic Association invited members of the National Committee of the Second Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference who believe in Islam, and members of the China Islamic Association in Beijing, to hold a symposium. Deputy Director Da Pongsheng called on Muslims across the country to support the liberation of Taiwan with various practical actions. During the New Year, huge red banners opposing the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" and supporting the liberation of Taiwan were hung on major streets, city gates, and the entrances of many shops throughout the city.

Shanghai's various circles are determined to support the liberation of Taiwan
Representatives from all walks of life in Shanghai, and tens of thousands of workers, students, government staff, sailors, doctors, and others, have gathered one after another, determined to support the liberation of Taiwan with their practical actions and crush the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty." At a meeting of representatives from all walks of life, Pan Hannian, Third Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, said: Shanghai is at the forefront of the struggle to liberate Taiwan. Therefore, the people of Shanghai bear a major responsibility in the struggle to liberate Taiwan. He called on everyone to strengthen unity a hundredfold, heighten vigilance, overcome difficulties, and do all kinds of work well to support the liberation of Taiwan with practical actions. Zhou Gucheng, a representative of the Shanghai local organizations of the democratic parties, said: We firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement on the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty." If anyone dares to invade our country, we must resolutely fight back against the interventionists and provocateurs. Xie Xuehong, a representative of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, said: The people of Taiwan have paid more than 500,000 precious lives in the 60 years of struggle against the invaders. They urgently demand liberation from the oppression of the American invaders and Chiang bandits and return to the embrace of the motherland. They believe that the people of the motherland will definitely be able to liberate Taiwan. Shanghai workers are actively rushing to produce single-layer uniforms, kettles, and other military supplies for the frontline troops in Zhejiang and Fujian in 1955. Many production teams have successively completed their December production tasks ahead of schedule. Students from the Shanghai Fisheries College wrote letters to comfort the heroic soldiers on the front lines of Fujian and Zhejiang, encouraging them to resolutely liberate Taiwan.

Anti-spy and anti-special agent struggles launched in coastal Fujian
The people along the coast of Fujian Province have launched a mass anti-spy and anti-special agent movement, and are actively carrying out propaganda for the liberation of Taiwan. The people along the coast of the Jinjiang and Minhou special districts have successively formulated patriotic security pacts in units of production cooperatives or families. The covenants all proposed to resolutely eliminate Chiang bandit spies, strengthen social security, and support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan. People in Zhaoan, Dongshan, Haicheng, Hui'an, Fuqing, Changle and other counties have rectified and newly established many organizations to protect warehouses, highways, bridges and power lines. Militiamen on some islands belonging to Putian County have organized maritime patrol teams to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army in patrolling the sea. Quanzhou is located on the front line of coastal defense. Sixty reporters in the city first made reports at mass meetings or representative meetings in various units, and then propagandists divided the area to promote propaganda to the vast number of workers, shop assistants, and residents. In the past three months, thirty amateur cultural and artistic teams have compiled and adapted small Minnan dialect operas, living newspapers, and dramas related to the liberation of Taiwan, and performed them in streets, squares, construction sites, rural areas, and residential areas. The city's 45 street newspapers also used the liberation of Taiwan as the main content for propaganda.

Jiangxi martyrs' families and military families accuse the United States of its crimes of aggression
Yiyang, Shangrao, and other 14 counties and Fuzhou City in Jiangxi Province have recently convened representative meetings of martyrs' families, military families, and revolutionary disabled soldiers. When the representatives discussed the current situation at the meeting, they all angrily denounced the United States for its crime of occupying our country's territory of Taiwan, and expressed their willingness to support the struggle to liberate Taiwan with practical actions. Liu Huojin, a representative of military families in Yangqiao Township, Yiyang County, said: "If Taiwan is not liberated for a day, our motherland will not be peaceful for a day. I guarantee to write to my husband at the front frequently, encourage him to study military skills well, and strive to make meritorious service in the battle to liberate Taiwan." Luo Zhaodi, a military family member in Chengguan Town, Fengcheng County, said that in addition to writing letters to encourage her husband at the front, she would also do a good job in street propaganda.

Guangdong farmers set off a wave of selling surplus grain
In order to support the struggle to liberate Taiwan, farmers in Guangdong Province are setting off a wave of selling surplus grain. Farmers throughout the province have expressed their willingness to support the People's Liberation Army in eliminating Chiang bandits with their greatest strength. Qi Ya Yong, an elderly woman in the first district of Wanning County, had her only son taken away by Chiang bandit soldiers. Recently, she accused at a rally: "Chiang bandits are my enemies for thousands of generations. I will never be reconciled if they are not eliminated!" She sold 60 catties of grain she saved to the state, and led many farmers in her neighborhood to sell surplus grain to the state. When the representative meeting of farmers in the third district of Nanhai County was discussing the issue of selling grain, they heard the news of the signing of the US-Chiang war treaty. All the representatives immediately passed a resolution, proposing to sell an additional one million catties of grain outside the state's unified purchase plan to support the liberation of Taiwan.

People of all ethnic groups in Yunnan support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement
People of all ethnic groups on the Yunnan border resolutely oppose the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty." In Mangshi, the capital of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, members of the Autonomous Prefecture People's Government, members of the Consultative Committee, and representatives of ethnic groups' government cadres, cultural and educational circles held a symposium to oppose the US-Chiang treaty. They unanimously condemned the aggressive behavior of US imperialism and the traitorous activities of Chiang bandits at the meeting. To support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement, Dai farmers in Nambu Township, Luxi County, paid more than 300,000 catties of public grain in five days. Farmers of all ethnic groups in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture are setting off a wave of paying patriotic public grain and selling surplus grain to the state to support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement. At the joint meeting of members of the People's Government and members of the Consultative Committee recently held in the Honghe Hani Autonomous Prefecture, members and representatives of all ethnic groups condemned the war conspiracy of the US-Chiang treaty. Cao Xiangmo (Hani nationality), an agricultural labor model, said: "The Communist Party has just led us to remove the big stone slab pressing on our bodies, and we will never allow US imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek to put the big stone slab on us again."
