Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 11th - TASS reports: On the 9th, Italian Communist Party General Secretary Palmiro Togliatti delivered a report on the first item on the agenda, "Communists Fight for Freedom, Peace, and Socialism," at the Fourth National Congress of the Italian Communist Party.

Togliatti's report was repeatedly interrupted by applause. He analyzed the international environment and domestic situation in Italy since the Seventh Party Congress. Togliatti pointed out that the Communist Party had achieved successes in recent years due to the united action of the Communists and Socialists and the united action of the working class. The Communist Party had strengthened organizationally through increasing membership and expanding its electorate.

Togliatti said that the result of our work has changed the balance of power on the political stage, made the masses of people more conscious, and made them more eager and deeply convinced that they must rise to defend freedom and peace and strive for better living conditions. Togliatti said that the imperialist bloc is trying its best to intensify international tension by various means, such as: piecing together military alliances like the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, concluding aggressive treaties with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, stepping up arms expansion and reviving German militarism in order to use it again against the Soviet Union, and, finally, the recent meeting of the North Atlantic Alliance Council made such a very serious resolution.

Togliatti pointed out that this war policy is hostile to the socialist camp, including the Soviet Union, the People's Democracies of Europe, and great China, whose people are engaged in peaceful labor, constantly increasing industrial and agricultural production, and have achieved unprecedented political unity and solidarity in history. Togliatti said that everyone must now realize that nearly half of mankind has chosen this path, and they are vowed to move forward without turning back.

When Togliatti spoke about the coexistence of countries with different social systems, he said: Some people disagree with us, saying that the meaning of the word coexistence is too limited. On the contrary, it must be said that it is common life. We are not opposed to this, because we believe that countries must not only coexist together, but must also better understand each other and maintain contact with each other. However, to achieve this goal, the first thing that must be done is to eliminate the threat of atomic holocaust, prohibit one country from interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, and guarantee the independence of all countries; it is also necessary to implement a concrete policy of peace, which should be based on by governments of all countries, and supported, or more correctly, demanded, by the people themselves.

If peace is desired, this path should be taken, and not the path of reviving German militarism, which serves the atomic generals - the war criminals of today and tomorrow.

Togliatti said that advocating a new approach in international relations is the basis of our policy. We demand the establishment of a peaceful government that will reject any military provocations based on the reconstruction of the German Wehrmacht and atomic strategy. We demand the establishment of a government that can take concrete measures to establish peaceful coexistence. We firmly advocate a policy of peace, while demanding the restoration of our country's independence, which has been destroyed by the government, which has given part of our territory to foreigners and handed over our troops to their command. Therefore, it can be said that Italy has now become an economically and politically dependent country. Togliatti stressed that work must continue among Catholics to achieve a policy of peace.

Togliatti said that due to the government's attacks on the people's freedom and the reactionaries' attempts to eliminate the democratic order, the domestic political situation in Italy has become tense. Togliatti said that the current government does not have the support of the majority of the people in the country, nor does it have a reliable majority in parliament. It only pursues one goal - to hold power. One of the characteristics of government activity is that no initiative has been taken to restore the economy and implement an independent foreign policy. It is betting on "anti-communism" in order to collude with reactionaries. Togliatti pointed out that the measures passed by the government on December 4, 1954, to suppress democratic movements, cooperative organizations, and working people are illegal and shameful. He said that this attack was taken under the direction of foreigners, but mainly for the benefit of the monopoly groups that manipulate the Italian economy. The support of the Church forces for the government and their interference in the country's political life has deepened the danger of turning Italy into a Franco-type country.

After Togliatti pointed out the serious state of the Italian economy, he said that the government had not made the slightest effort to improve the people's situation, reorganize state-owned industrial enterprises, stop layoffs, and solve the problems of the peasants. All this is the result of the current Italian economic structure, which is: retaining the remnants of feudalism, with wealth concentrated in the hands of a few large monopoly capital groups that control the state apparatus. Togliatti said that the capital of 24 large companies accounts for 39 percent of the capital of tens of thousands of Italian companies. These monopoly groups, such as "Fiat," "Montecatini," "Snia Viscosa," "Italian Cement Company," etc., are combined into an Italian Industrialists' Federation, which actually determines the government's policies, supports the rule of the Christian Democratic Party, maintains ties with foreigners, and drives reactionary forces to oppose the democratic movement.

Togliatti continued, we use our plan to oppose these conspiracies of the reactionaries. Our plan is to safeguard the interests of the working people, safeguard democratic freedom, improve the living standards of the working people, implement the reforms stipulated in the Constitution, safeguard national independence and peace. Togliatti emphasized that maintaining democratic freedom is the primary task of the Communists at present and the main task of the working class.

Democratic freedom will continue to be threatened until measures are taken to limit the rule of monopoly capital and meet the demands of workers and peasants, until measures are taken to implement land reform, revive our southern regions, nationalize monopoly companies, and regulate monopoly companies. All sectors of society are extremely dissatisfied with the rule of monopoly capital groups. Therefore, it is possible to establish the broadest united front to fight for the democratic renewal of Italian society within the scope of the Constitution.

Togliatti said that any attempt to return to open reactionary dictatorship and fascism will lead Italy to the prospect of civil war, and the people will bravely participate in this civil war. At present, there is a tendency to stifle the democratic freedom stipulated in the Constitution, which shows that the foundation of democracy is being undermined, that is to say, various class relations and political relations are intensifying. At the same time, this also means that the people should carry out more intense economic and political struggles in order to establish a broader united front including the majority of residents, a front that can unite the majority of residents to maintain and fight for peace, and maintain labor and freedom.

Togliatti continued, at this conference, we determine the basic political stance that our Communist Party will follow in the coming years. We fight for the unity of the working people and democratic forces, and we are convinced that establishing this unity can solve all the major problems before us.

We do not demand to form a government with our participation that takes measures to safeguard the interests of peace and the interests of the working people. We demand that the government formulate a program to ensure that the working class participates in the administration of state affairs and puts forward the goal of effectively defending peace and carrying out the reforms needed by the country. Togliatti said that therefore, our basic political requirement remains to be the establishment of a peaceful government, a government that can restore democratic freedom and is committed to improving the living standards of Italian residents.

Togliatti finally talked about the tasks of the Communist Party.

    在意共第四次全国代表会议九日会议上
    意共总书记陶里亚蒂的报告　（摘要）
    【新华社讯】塔斯社罗马十一日电：九日，意大利共产党总书记帕尔米罗·陶里亚蒂在意大利共产党第四次全国代表会议上就第一项议程“共产党员为争取自由、和平和社会主义而斗争”做了报告。
    陶里亚蒂的报告一再地为掌声所打断。他对自从第七次党代表大会以来这段时期意大利所处的国际环境和国内局势作了分析。陶里亚蒂指出，由于共产党人和社会党人的一致行动、由于工人阶级的一致行动，共产党在最近几年中取得了成绩。由于党员人数的增加和自己选民人数的扩大，共产党在组织上是加强了。
    陶里亚蒂说，我们工作的结果使政治舞台上的力量对比起了变化，使人民群众更加觉悟了，使他们更热切和深刻地相信必须起来保卫自由和和平、争取美好的生活条件。陶里亚蒂说，帝国主义集团竭力用种种办法来加剧国际紧张局势，如：拼凑东南亚公约组织之类的军事联盟、和蒋介石集团缔结侵略性条约、加紧扩充军备和复活德国军国主义以便再用它来对付苏联，最后，北大西洋联盟理事会最近一次会议竟作出了那样一种十分严重的决议。
    陶里亚蒂指出，这种战争政策敌对的对象是包括苏联、欧洲各人民民主国家和伟大中国在内的社会主义阵营的，这些国家的人民正在从事和平劳动，不断地增加工农业生产，并且取得了历史上空前未有的政治上的一致和团结。陶里亚蒂说，现在每个人都必须认识到，全人类差不多有一半的人已选择了这条道路，他们并誓无返顾地向前走去。
    陶里亚蒂谈到具有不同社会制度的国家共处的问题时说道：有人对我们表示异议说，共处这个词的含意太有限了，相反的，必须说共同生活。我们并不反对这样，因为我们相信各个国家不仅必须在
  一起共处，而且必须要互相更好地了解、互相保持接触。但是，要达到这一目的，首先必须要做到消除原子浩劫的威胁，禁止一个国家干涉其他国家内政，保障一切国家的独立；还必须要实行具体的和平政策，各国政府应以这种政策为依据，各国人民本身也支持、或者更正确地说，要求实行这种政策的。
      如果是希望和平的话，就应该走这一条道路，而不应走复活德国军国主义的道路，德国军国主义是为原子将军们——今天和明天的战犯们效劳的。
    陶里亚蒂说，主张在国际关系中采取新的方针，是我们政策的基础。我们要求建立一个和平政府，这个政府将拒绝任何以重建德国国防军和原子战略为基础的军事挑衅。我们要求建立一个能够为建立和平共处而采取具体措施的政府。我们坚主和平政策，同时要求恢复已经为政府破坏了的我们国家的独立，这个政府已把我国一部分领土让给了外国人，把我国的军队交给他们指挥，因此可以说，意大利现在已经变成了经济上和政治上的附属国。陶里亚蒂着重指出，必须在天主教徒中继续进行工作，以实现和平政策。
    陶里亚蒂说，由于政府对人民自由实行攻击，由于反动派企图消灭民主秩序，意大利国内政治局势紧张起来了。陶里亚蒂说，现在的政府没有得到国内大多数人的支持，在议会中也没有可靠的大多数，它只追求一个目的——把持政权。政府活动的一个特点是，没有采取任何主动来恢复经济和执行独立外交政策。它把赌注放在“反共产主义”上面，以便勾结反动分子。陶里亚蒂指出，政府在一九五四年十二月四日所通过的压制民主运动、合作组织和劳动人民的措施是非法的和可耻的。他说，这种进攻是在外国人的指使下采取的，然而主要是为了操纵意大利经济的垄断集团的利益。教会势力对政府的支持和他们对国家政治生活的干涉，加深了使意大利变为佛朗哥型国家的危险。
    陶里亚蒂指出了意大利经济的严重状况以后说，政府没有作丝毫努力来改善人民的境况，改组属于国家的工业企业，停止解雇以及解决农民的问题。这一切都是当前意大利经济结构的后果，这种结构是：保留着封建制度的残余，财富集中在少数控制着国家机构的大垄断资本手中。陶里亚蒂说，二十四家大公司的资本占数万家意大利公司的资本的百分之三十九。这些垄断集团就是“菲亚特”、
  “蒙特卡提尼”、“斯尼亚—维斯科萨”、“意大利水泥公司”等，它们结合成一个意大利工业家联合会，在实际上决定着政府的政策，支持着天主教民主党的统治，和外国人保持着联系，并且在驱使反动势力来反对民主运动。
    陶里亚蒂继续说道，我们用我们的计划来反对反动派的这些阴谋诡计，我们的计划是维护劳动人民的利益、维护民主自由、提高劳动人民生活水平、实行宪法所规定的改革、维护民族独立和和平。陶里亚蒂并着重指出，维护民主自由是共产党人目前的首要任务，是工人阶级的主要任务。
    在没有采取措施限制垄断资本的统治和满足工农的要求之前、在没有采取措施实行土地改革、复兴我国南部地区、把垄断公司收归国有和对垄断公司实行管制之前，民主自由将一直受到威胁。社会各界对垄断资本集团的统治极为不满。因此，有可能建立一条最广泛的统一战线为争取在宪法范围内使意大利社会得到民主革新而斗争。
    陶里亚蒂说，想回到公开的反动独裁和法西斯主义的任何企图将使意大利面临内战的前途，而人民将会勇敢地参加这个内战。目前有一种扼杀宪法规定的民主自由的倾向，这表明，民主的基础在遭到破坏，也就是说，各种阶级关系和政治关系尖锐化。同时这也意味着，人民应当进行更加激烈的经济和政治斗争，以便建立一个包括大多数居民的更加广泛的统一战线，建立一个可以团结大多数居民来维护和争取和平、维护劳动和自由的战线。
    陶里亚蒂继续说道，在这次会议上，我们确定我们共产党在今后的年代中所要遵循的基本政治立场。我们为争取劳动人民和民主力量的团结而斗争，我们确信，建立这种团结就能够解决摆在我们面前的所有重大问题。
      我们不要求成立一个采取维护和平利益和劳动人民利益的措施的有我们参加的政府，我们要求政府制订一个纲领，保证劳动阶级参加管理国家的事务，提出有效地保卫和平和进行国家所需要的改革的目标。陶里亚蒂说，因此，我们的基本政治要求仍旧是成立一个和平政府，一个能恢复民主自由、致力于提高意大利居民的生活水平的政府。
    陶里亚蒂最后谈到共产党的任务。
