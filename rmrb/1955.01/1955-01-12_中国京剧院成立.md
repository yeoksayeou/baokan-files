    The China Peking Opera Theater held its inaugural meeting on the 10th. At the meeting, Mei Lanfang, the president of the China Peking Opera Theater, announced that the theater would serve as a model for Peking Opera reform. Its tasks include organizing the creation and adaptation of Peking Opera scripts, regularly staging excellent repertoire, cautiously, methodically, and with focus conducting practical reforms of Peking Opera stage art, transforming old-style troupes into new-style theaters, establishing a standardized theater system, continuing to improve the political, cultural, and artistic levels of actors, and attaching importance to the training of young actors.
    Mei Lanfang said: The establishment of the China Peking Opera Theater once again demonstrates the importance the Communist Party and the People's Government place on traditional Chinese art, and the care given to the further development of Peking Opera art. He expressed his determination to do his best, together with everyone, to make the greatest efforts for the reform and development of Peking Opera art.
    Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of Culture, pointed out in his speech at the inaugural meeting: The China Peking Opera Theater should become a model for the entire Peking Opera community. First, it must establish the policy of performing for workers, peasants, and soldiers, and unite all members of the theater and people in the national Peking Opera community to work together, in coordination with the great socialist construction of the motherland, so that Peking Opera art can achieve its due success.
    Subsequently, Tian Han, Chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association, Luo Heru, Deputy Director of the Chinese Opera Research Institute, and Zhang Jichun, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Workers, spoke in succession, warmly congratulating the establishment of the theater. The famous Peking Opera actors Ye Shenglan and Zhang Yunxi also spoke. They thanked the Communist Party and the People's Government for their attention to Peking Opera art, and expressed that they would humbly learn and strive for artistic practice in the future.
    As early as 1942, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao gave great attention to the reform of Peking Opera, and established the Yan'an Peking Opera Theater. The newly established China Peking Opera Theater has gradually developed on this basis. The theater is led by Mei Lanfang and Ma Shaobo as President and Vice President, respectively, and A Jia as the General Director. It also has three troupes, led by actors Li Shaochun, Ye Shenglan, and Zhang Yunxi, respectively.

    中国京剧院成立
    中国京剧院在十日举行成立大会。在成立大会上，中国京剧院院长梅兰芳宣布：中国京剧院今后将作为京剧改革的示范性的剧院，其任务是组织京剧剧本的创作和整理，经常上演优秀的剧目；极其慎重地、有步骤地、有重点地进行京剧舞台艺术改革的实践；改造旧型剧团为新型剧院，建立正规化的剧院制度；继续提高演员的政治、文化和艺术水平，并重视培养青年演员的工作。
    梅兰芳说：中国京剧院的成立，又一次说明了共产党和人民政府对于中国传统艺术的重视，和对京剧艺术进一步发展所给予的关怀。他表示一定尽自己的力量，和大家一起为京剧艺术的改革和发展进行最大的努力。
    文化部副部长钱俊瑞在成立大会上的讲话中指出：中国京剧院要成为全国京剧界的榜样，首先要确定为工农兵演出的方针，并要团结全院人员和全国京剧界人士共同努力，配合祖国伟大的社会主义建设，使京剧艺术获得应有的成功。
    接着，中国戏剧家协会主席田汉、中国戏曲研究院副院长罗合如、北京市文学艺术工作者联合会副主席张季纯相继讲话，热烈祝贺剧院的成立。著名的京剧演员叶盛兰、张云溪也讲了话。他们感谢共产党和人民政府对京剧艺术的重视，并表示今后要虚心学习，努力艺术实践。
    远在一九四二年，中国共产党中央和毛主席便给予京剧改革工作以极大的关怀，成立了延安平剧院。新成立的中国京剧院是在这样的基础上逐步发展而来的。该剧院由梅兰芳、马少波任正副院长，阿甲任总导演。并设有三个剧团，由演员李少春、叶盛兰、张云溪分别任团长。　（新华社）
