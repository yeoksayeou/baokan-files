Farmers in Jiaxing Prefecture, Zhejiang Province, are actively engaged in silkworm production. This area is a major silk-producing region in China, with a large annual output of silkworm cocoons. Last year, the value of fresh cocoons produced in the entire area exceeded 300 billion yuan. To produce more silk and support national industrial construction, the area plans to expand mulberry garden acreage by more than 23,000 mu this year. Yuqian County has already planted 680,000 mulberry seedlings, exceeding the original plan by three times. In the key areas of Changxing County, the work of transplanting mulberry trees onto the mountains is nearing completion. In addition to actively expanding mulberry gardens, farmers in various places are also strengthening the management and fertilization of existing mulberry gardens.

    嘉兴农民开展蚕桑生产
    浙江省嘉兴专区农民积极进行蚕桑生产工作。该区是我国主要蚕丝产区，每年蚕茧产量很大，去年全区生产的鲜茧价值三千多亿元。为了生产更多的蚕丝，支援国家工业建设，该区计划今年再扩大桑园面积二万三千多亩。于潜县现已种植了六十八万株桑苗，超过原计划三倍，长兴县重点区的移植桑树上山工作已接近结束，各地农民除积极扩大桑园外，还加强现有桑园的管理和施肥等工作。
