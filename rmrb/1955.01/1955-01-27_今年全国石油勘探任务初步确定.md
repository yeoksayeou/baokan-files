    National Petroleum Exploration Tasks for This Year Preliminary Determined
    (Xinhua News Agency, 23rd) The petroleum exploration tasks for China in 1955 have been preliminarily determined at the Sixth National Petroleum Exploration Conference, which closed on January 23rd.
    This year's petroleum exploration tasks require that by the end of this year, each exploration team should explore and provide design-ready exploitable petroleum reserves that are one-third to two-thirds greater than those proven last year; the natural gas reserves should also increase by 1.5 billion cubic meters compared to what was known last year. To support this task, the total drilling footage for petroleum this year will increase by about 80% compared to last year. In addition to concentrating drilling in already known oilfields such as Laojunmiao in Yumen and Dushanzi, preparations are also being made to drill deep exploration wells on structures with already discovered good oil-bearing layers. In terms of geological survey, it has been decided to focus on five basins: Jiuquan, Junggar, Qaidam, Turpan, and Sichuan. Preliminary investigations in the Qaidam and Turpan basins last year have proven that they are the most promising oil-bearing areas. This year, both regions are preparing to focus on detailed surveys, combined with necessary general surveys, to gradually gain a comprehensive understanding of these areas.
    In view of China's current lack of petroleum exploration experience and weak technical capabilities, this National Petroleum Exploration Conference focused on discussing the measures to be taken to complete these tasks. This year, in addition to the General Administration of Petroleum Management dispatching more exploration teams of various types, the Ministry of Geology of the People's Republic of China is also preparing to organize twenty-five general survey teams to conduct petroleum general surveys in Xinjiang, Qinghai, Sichuan, and other places. The Chinese Academy of Sciences will also send three research groups to assist petroleum exploration teams in conducting geological research. The conference unanimously agreed that further learning from advanced Soviet experience is an important way to improve the technical level and work quality of exploration personnel. The conference invited Soviet experts to attend and provide guidance, and also listened to and discussed the experience accumulated by the former Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company in conducting petroleum exploration and drilling. In order to quickly determine the oil reserves of many geological structures, each drilling team will increase the number of large-scale Soviet-style drilling rigs this year, and further promote the "rapid drilling method." Each drilling rig is required to increase its monthly drilling speed by 44 meters compared to last year, and the core extraction rate is required to increase by 12%.
    This conference lasted for eleven days, and most of the participants were cadres at the level of small team leaders or above from various exploration teams.

    今年全国石油勘探任务初步确定
    【新华社二十三日讯】一九五五年我国石油勘探任务，已在一月二十三日闭幕的第六次全国石油勘探会议上初步确定下来。
    今年石油勘探任务要求各个勘探队到今年年底止应探可交设计开采的石油储量，要比去年探明的增加三分之一到三分之二；天然气的储量也要比去年所知道的增加十五亿立方公尺。配合这个任务，今年的石油钻探总进尺将比去年增加百分之八十左右。除了在已经知道的油田如玉门的老君庙、独山子等处集中钻探外，还准备在已发现的有良好储油层的构造上打深探井。在地质勘查方面，决定以酒泉、准噶尔、柴达木、吐鲁番、四川等五个盆地为重点。柴达木和吐鲁番盆地经过去年初步调查，已证明是最有希望的含油地区。今年这两个地区都准备以细测为主，配合必要的普查，逐步求得对这些地区的全面了解。
    根据我国目前石油勘探经验不足、技术力量薄弱等情况，这次全国石油勘探会议着重讨论了完成这些任务应采取的措施。今年除了由石油管理总局增派各种类型的勘探队伍以外，中华人民共和国地质部也准备组织二十五个普查队，到新疆、青海、四川等地进行石油普查，中国科学院也将派出三个研究组，协助石油勘探队进行地质研究。这次会议一致认为：进一步学习苏联先进经验是提高勘探人员技术水平和工作质量的重要方法。会议邀请了苏联专家出席指导，还听取和讨论了前中苏石油公司在进行石油勘测、钻探等方面所积累的经验。为了迅速探明许多地质构造的储油量，今年各钻探队都将增加大型的苏式钻机，并进一步推广“快速钻进法”。要求每部钻机每月钻探速度比去年提高四十四公尺，岩芯采取率提高百分之十二。
    这次会议前后共开了十一天，参加的大多数是各勘探队小队长以上的干部。
