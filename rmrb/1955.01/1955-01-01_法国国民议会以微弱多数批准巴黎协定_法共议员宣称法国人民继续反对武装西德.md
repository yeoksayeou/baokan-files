Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 31st: The French National Assembly held a vote of confidence in the Mendès-France government on the afternoon of the 30th regarding Article 1 of the bill requesting approval of the Paris Agreements. This article includes the protocols for arming West Germany and allowing West Germany to join the Western European Union, which had been rejected by the National Assembly on the 24th.

The meeting on the 30th proceeded directly to a vote without debate. The results of the vote were: 287 votes in favor of confidence in the Mendès-France government, and 260 votes against. In a previous vote of confidence held on the 29th, the National Assembly had similarly approved the entire Paris Agreements bill, excluding Article 1, by a narrow majority.

After the announcement of the voting results, cries of "Down with German Rearmament!" immediately resounded from the seats of representatives of different political groups. Those deputies who voted against the Paris Agreements shouted at those who voted in favor of reviving German militarism: "Murderers," "You will pay a heavy price for this."

During the evening session of the National Assembly, Deputy Mathilde Gabriel-Péri spoke, condemning those who voted in favor of approving the Paris military agreements.

Communist Deputy François Billoux, speaking on behalf of the Communist parliamentary group, said that the French people would never tolerate today's vote, which is a crime against France and the people, and a result of the intolerable pressure exerted by the US and British governments. He emphasized that the Paris Agreements were passed by a negligible majority.

Billoux continued, saying that we will never cease the struggle against arming West Germany and against the Paris Agreements. He emphasized the responsibility that the Mendès-France government and the deputies who supported it should bear for approving the Paris Agreements. The Communists will no longer support this government and will not allow the deputies who voted in favor of arming West Germany to absolve themselves of their guilt.

On the National Assembly's agenda were originally two other items: an amendment proposed by Rousdo-Norlago requiring guarantees for negotiations with the Soviet Union before the Paris Agreements take effect; and a motion proposed by Maurice Faure, Pierre Gourland, and others, which called on the government to take all measures to seek peace among nations based on peaceful coexistence and simultaneous, supervised disarmament. The Speaker of the National Assembly announced that discussions on these two proposals would be postponed indefinitely.

The National Assembly then adjourned, to resume discussions on budgetary issues after the recess.

    法国国民议会以微弱多数批准巴黎协定
    法共议员宣称法国人民继续反对武装西德
     【新华社三十一日讯】巴黎消息：法国国民议会三十日下午就孟戴斯—弗朗斯要求批准巴黎协定法案中第一条举行对政府的信任投票，第一条包括武装西德和使西德加入西欧联盟的议定书，这一条曾经在二十四日为国民议会否决过。
    三十日的会议没有进行辩论，就举行投票。投票结果：信任孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府的为二百八十七票，反对的为二百六十票。在二十九日举行的一次信任投票，国民议会曾同样以微弱的多数批准除第一条外的整个巴黎协定法案。
    在宣布投票结果以后，不同政治团体代表的座位上马上响起了“打倒德国重新武装！”的呼声。那些投票反对巴黎协定的议员们向着那些投票赞成复活德国军国主义的议员们喊道：“杀人犯”，“你们将为此付出重大代价”。
    在国民议会晚间会议上，议员马蒂德·加布里埃—佩里发言谴责那些投票赞成批准巴黎军事协定的人。
    共产党议员弗朗索瓦·皮佑代表共产党议会党团发言说，法国人民决不会容忍今天的表决，这种表决是对法国、对人民犯罪，是美国和英国政府方面施加不能容许的压力的结果。他着重指出，巴黎协定是以微不足道的多数票通过的。
    皮佑接着说，我们决不中止反对武装西德和反对巴黎协定的斗争。他着重指出孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府和支持这个政府的议员对批准巴黎协定应该负的责任。共产党员决不再支持这个政府，决不允许投票赞成武装西德的议员们给自己解脱罪责。
    在国民议会的议程上原来还有两个项目：鲁斯多诺—拉果提出的关于必须保证在使巴黎协定生效以前同苏联谈判的修正案；莫里斯·弗尔、皮埃尔·古朗等人提出的动议，这个动议要政府采取一切措施来谋求以和平共处和同时而有监督地实行裁减军备为基础的各国间的和平。国民议会议长宣布：关于这两项提案的讨论无限期延期。
    国民议会接着休会，在休会完毕复会时要继续讨论预算问题。
