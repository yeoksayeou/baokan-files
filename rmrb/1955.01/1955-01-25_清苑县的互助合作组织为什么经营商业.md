Why Mutual Aid and Cooperative Organizations in Qingyuan County Engage in Commerce
Zhang Wenkuan

Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in Qingyuan County, Hebei Province, are universally engaged in collective commercial activities. As of January 7th, according to incomplete statistics, as many as 107 agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams were operating coal yards and holding "legal" business licenses. In the Fifth and Sixth Districts alone, more than 40 agricultural production cooperatives were operating coal yards of a commercial nature. In Nandaran Village, out of twelve agricultural production cooperatives, nine were running coal yards, and several agricultural production cooperatives even put up signs saying "Agricultural Production Cooperative Coal Yard of So-and-So"; one agricultural production cooperative also ran a butcher shop. In the natural villages of Nanqi and Huangtuo, out of twelve agricultural production cooperatives, seven were running coal yards, and one was selling pig bristles. Most of the coal yards operated by these cooperatives or teams simply bought coal and sold it without processing; the "Jianguo" agricultural production cooperative in Huangtuo Village even hired laborers to haul coal. In addition to selling some locally, they also sold as far away as Lixian and Gaoyang counties.

Recently, the trend of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in Qingyuan County engaging in collective commercial activities has been developing. According to statistics from January 5th, 6th, and 7th, the Qingyuan County People's Government Industry and Commerce Section issued 24 coal yard licenses to agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams; in addition, there were many who opened butcher shops, restaurants, and sold medicines.

Some agricultural production cooperatives, in order to seek exorbitant profits, have violated state policies and laws. The agricultural production cooperative led by Fu Xicheng in Fojiaying Village, First District, secretly ground the 210 catties of wheat seeds loaned by the state into flour to make pancakes and sell them; the market price of pancakes was 2,000 yuan per catty, but they sold them for 4,000 yuan per catty; they were afraid that the state would find out and levy taxes, so they did not record any sales. The Xue Shantong agricultural production cooperative in Wangpan Village, Second District, sold medicines, made false accounts, and evaded more than 1.89 million yuan in state taxes. Some cooperatives or teams also deliberately seized the markets of state-owned and cooperative businesses. For example, the Huangtuo Joint Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative sold coal balls for 11,500 yuan per 100 catties, while the agricultural production cooperative sold them for 10,000 yuan; the supply and marketing cooperative sold coal chunks for 14,000 yuan per 100 catties, while the agricultural production cooperative sold them for 13,000 yuan. Sun Laoqi, the head of an agricultural production cooperative in Linshui Village, once said: "If the supply and marketing cooperative sells for 13,000 yuan, we will sell for 12,000 yuan; if the supply and marketing cooperative wants to sell for 10,000 yuan, we will sell for 8,000 yuan." Some cooperatives also cut corners and deceived customers. The coal balls sold by the agricultural production cooperative led by Li Guoxing in Nandaran Village contained too much soil, and they would clump together when burned, blocking the furnace ash.

Why is this phenomenon happening? The fundamental reason, of course, is that capitalist ideology is at work; however, the leadership of Qingyuan County should also bear a great responsibility for this.

The members have just been transformed from individual farmers, and their acceptance of some socialist ideas and participation in agricultural production cooperatives is a progressive aspect of theirs; however, it cannot be denied that their old capitalist spontaneous tendencies will not disappear as soon as they join the cooperative. Some leading cadres and members of the cooperatives want to get rich quickly by non-labor means and increase extra income; their "reason" is: "Only in this way can the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives be demonstrated." "Didn't the higher authorities call for the development of diverse sideline occupations? There are few sideline opportunities in our area, so we have to treat this kind of business as a sideline." "Our area is a disaster area, and we can't do without this." The Qingyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China did not seriously criticize these ideas and did not persuade the masses of members to change this practice; on the contrary, they gave them support. Originally, after Qingyuan County suffered a disaster last year, only a small number of agricultural production cooperatives secretly ran some commercial coal yards. At that time, although some agricultural production cooperatives requested the County Industry and Commerce Section to approve their business operations, they did not develop much because the Industry and Commerce Section did not approve them. Later, Xia, the secretary of the Qingyuan County People's Government, said to the Industry and Commerce Section: "The County Committee has studied the issue of agricultural production cooperatives opening coal yards and approved it." The comrades of the Industry and Commerce Section proposed: "If agricultural production cooperatives operate coal yards, the supply and marketing plans of the supply and marketing cooperatives will be disrupted!" Secretary Xia said: "If the supply and marketing cooperatives cannot complete the plan, so be it; just write a report to the Coal Construction Company." (The supply and marketing cooperatives have contracts with the Coal Construction Company; Secretary Xia's words meant that the contracts could be canceled.) Since then, the number of mutual aid and cooperative organizations engaged in commerce has greatly increased. With the support of the Secretary of the Second District Committee, a privately-owned restaurant in Beixindian Village was merged into the agricultural production cooperative led by Liu Shujiu and operated by the cooperative. Fan Dezhang, the Secretary of the District Committee, even said: "I'll be responsible if I'm wrong!" Comrade Cui Yicheng, the Secretary of the County Committee, remained silent after learning about this situation. The County and District leaders adopted this attitude, which greatly facilitated the activities of rural capitalism.

When things had developed to such a serious point, the County Committee still did not recognize that promoting the activities of capitalist forces was an error in principle. Wang Yunfeng, the Director of the Rural Work Department of the Qingyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China, said to me: "After research by the County Committee, in order to protect draught animals, the meat workshops operated by agricultural production cooperatives can be abolished; for disaster relief, coal yards will not be banned for the time being."

The Qingyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that only by engaging in commerce can the livelihood problems of members of mutual aid teams and cooperatives in disaster areas be solved. Is this really the case? According to investigations, the vast majority of farmers in Xiaozhang Village Township, Huangtuo Township, Dafu Village Township, Dongshiqiao Township, and Shenzhuang area in Qingyuan County have the technology to process pig bristles. If they are all mobilized, they can maintain the livelihoods of more than 20,000 people. In addition, most of the state-owned and cooperative enterprises in Qingyuan County rely on carts to allocate materials, and disaster victims with carts and horses can engage in some transportation activities. (The Huangtuo Joint Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative had only 10,000 catties of grain on a certain day in December last year, and there was a danger of running out of stock; at that time, 80 carts were needed to haul grain, but only a dozen carts were found after searching for a day, and most of the carts had gone out to sell coal.) In addition, there are other sideline production opportunities to be found. The leadership of Qingyuan County did not make the greatest efforts in this area to lead and organize disaster victims to produce, but emphasized that agricultural production cooperatives must be allowed to engage in commerce for disaster relief, which is obviously wrong.

Facts have proved that allowing mutual aid and cooperative organizations to develop capitalist trends is very detrimental to agricultural production and the agricultural cooperation movement. Some new cooperatives have already collapsed under the erosion of capitalist forces. In Dabaituan Village, Fifth District, an agricultural production cooperative collapsed because the head of the cooperative, Zhang Bin, acted as an agent for the supply and marketing cooperative in selling oil and vinegar, the member Zhang Bingwen opened a pharmacy, and some members opened their own wood factories, and it fell apart. Some cooperatives do not want to engage in winter production because the members are used to the "sweetness" of engaging in commercial speculation. The "Heroic" agricultural production cooperative in Nandaran Village takes turns pulling coal; one shift pulls, the other rests, and there is little manuring activity. Judging from the overall winter agricultural production situation in Qingyuan County, it is far worse than in previous years. If this continues, winter production in mutual aid and cooperative organizations will not be done well, the famine will be prolonged, the mutual aid and cooperative organizations will gradually become organizations engaged in speculative commercial activities, and more cooperatives will disintegrate and collapse, causing even greater mistakes.

    清苑县的互助合作组织为什么经营商业
    张文宽
    河北省清苑县农业生产合作社和互助组普遍地集体经营商业。到一月七日为止，据不完全统计，经营煤厂并持有“合法”营业证照的农业生产合作社和互助组竟达一百零七个，光第五第六两区就有四十多个农业生产合作社经营商业性质的煤厂。南大冉村有十二个农业生产合作社，其中有九个社经营煤厂，有好几个农业生产合作社还挂出了“某某农业生产合作煤厂”的牌子；还有一个农业生产合作社兼营肉铺。南俟、黄陀两个自然村，也有十二个农业生产合作社，其中有七个社经营煤厂，一个社贩卖猪毛。这些社或组经营的煤厂，绝大部分是贩来煤以后不经加工就卖出去；黄陀村“建国”农业生产合作社还雇“脚”拉煤。他们除在本地卖出一部分以外，还远销到蠡县、高阳县一带。
    近来，清苑县农业生产合作社和互助组集体经营商业的趋势还正在发展着。就一月五、六、七日的统计，清苑县人民政府工商科就给农业生产合作社和互助组开了二十四份煤厂证照；此外还有很多开肉铺、饭馆的以及贩卖药品的。
    有些农业生产合作社为了牟取暴利，竟违犯国家政策和法纪。第一区傅家营村傅喜成领导的农业生产合作社，把国家贷给的二百一十斤麦种偷偷地磨成面做大饼卖；市价大饼是二千元一斤，他们卖四千元一斤；他们怕国家查出来征税，销出去都不记账。二区王盘村薛善通农业生产合作社贩卖药品，造假账，偷漏国家税收一百八十九万多元。有的社或组还蓄意夺取国营和合作社商业市场。如黄陀联村供销社每百斤煤球卖一万一千五百元，农业生产合作社就卖一万元；供销社每百斤煤块卖一万四千元，农业生产合作社卖一万三千元。林水村一个农业生产合作社社长孙老歧曾表示：“供销社卖一万三千元，我们卖一万二千元；供销社要卖一万元，我们就卖八千元。”有的社还偷工减料，欺骗顾客。南大冉村李国兴领导的农业生产合作社卖的煤球掺土太多，一烧就胶结在一起，炉灰通不下来。
    为什么会发生这种现象呢？根本的原因，固然是资本主义思想在作怪；但是，清苑县领导方面对这也应当负很大的责任。
    社员是刚由个体农民变成的，他们接受了一些社会主义思想，参加了农业生产合作社，是他们的进步的一方面；可是也不能否认，他们旧有的资本主义自发倾向并不是一入社就会消失的。有些社的领导骨干和社员想用非劳动的办法发“快财”，增加额外收入；他们的“理由”是：“只有这样才能显示出农业生产合作社的优越性。”“上级不是号召开展多种多样的副业吗？我们这地方副业门路少，只有把这种行当作为副业。”“我们这里是灾区，不搞这个不成。”中共清苑县委对于这些思想没有认真批判，没有说服社员群众改变这种做法，相反地，却给予支持。本来，清苑县在去年受灾后，仅有小部分农业生产合作社偷偷地办了些商业性质的煤厂。那时，虽也有农业生产合作社到县工商科要求批准营业，但因工商科不批准，所以没有多大发展。后来，清苑县人民政府夏秘书对工商科说：“农业生产合作社开煤厂的问题，县委已作了研究，可以批准。”工商科的同志们提出：“农业生产合作社经营煤厂，供销合作社的供销计划就打乱了！”夏秘书说：“供销合作社完不成计划拉倒，给煤建公司写个报告就算了。”（供销合作社同煤建公司订有合同；夏秘书说这话的意思是可以取消合同。）从此，农业互助合作组织经营商业的就大大增加起来。在第二区区委书记支持下，北辛店村的一个私营饭馆合并到刘书九领导的农业生产合作社里，由社经营。区委书记樊德章还说：“错了我负责！”县委书记崔益诚同志知道这种情况以后，不声不响。县区领导方面采取这种态度，就给农村资本主义的活动大开方便之门。
    事情发展到了如此严重的地步，县委仍然没有认识到助长资本主义势力的活动是一种原则性的错误。中共清苑县委农村工作部部长王酝峰同志对我说：“经过县委研究，为了保护耕畜，农业生产合作社经营的肉作坊可以取消；为了救灾，煤厂还是暂不禁止。”
    中共清苑县委认为：只有搞商业，才能解决灾区农业互助组员、合作社员的生活问题。事实真是这样的么？据调查，清苑县小张村乡、黄陀乡、大福村乡、东石桥乡、申庄一带，绝大部分农民有疏猪毛的技术，如果都活动起来，可以维持两万多人的生活。还有，清苑县各个国营的和合作社营的企业部门，大部分是依靠大车调拨物资，有车马的灾民可以从事一些运输活动。（黄陀联村供销社在去年十二月的某一天，仅有一万斤粮食了，已有脱销的危险；当时需用八十辆大车拉粮食，找了一天，只找到十几辆大车，大部分大车都出去贩煤去了。）另外，也还有别的副业生产门路可寻。清苑县的领导方面没有从这一方面尽最大努力去领导和组织灾民生产，却强调为了救灾就得允许农业生产合作社经营商业，这显然是不对的。
    事实证明，放任互助合作组织发展资本主义的趋势，对于农业生产和农业合作化运动是非常不利的。有的新社已经在资本主义势力的腐蚀下垮台了。第五区大白团村有个农业生产合作社，社长张彬给供销社代销油醋，社员张炳文开药铺，有的社员自己开木厂，四分八裂，终于垮台。有的社因为社员吃惯了搞商业投机的“甜头”，不愿进行冬季生产。南大冉村“英勇”农业生产合作社轮班拉煤；这班拉，那班歇着，很少进行积肥活动。从清苑县整个冬季农业生产的情况看，同往年比较是差得很远的。这样下去，互助合作组织的冬季生产搞不好，灾荒就会延长，互助合作组织会渐渐变成经营投机商业的组织，并且会有更多的社涣散垮台，会造成更大的错误。
