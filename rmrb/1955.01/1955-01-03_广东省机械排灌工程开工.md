Guangdong Province Starts Mechanical Irrigation and Drainage Project

The twenty-six mechanical irrigation and drainage projects planned for construction and renovation in Guangdong Province this winter and next spring have successively commenced and are expected to be completed before the flood season this year. After these projects are completed, the province's mechanical irrigation and drainage capacity will expand from the original 12,080+ horsepower to 14,900+ horsepower, and the benefiting farmland will increase from 270,000 mu to 430,000 mu. It is estimated that the annual increase in rice production will be worth more than 34 billion yuan.

The total cost of these projects is more than 20 billion yuan, of which the largest is the Gaoming Xia Taihe Wei mechanical drainage project, which requires 8.2 billion yuan. After completion, it will be able to drain 8.42 cubic meters of water per second, and the amount of water drained in one hour is equivalent to the daily water consumption of a city with a population of 500,000.

    广东省机械排灌工程开工
    广东省计划去冬今春新建和改建的二十六宗机械排灌工程，现已先后开工，预计今年汛期以前可以完工。这些工程完成后，全省机械排灌能力将从原一万二千零八十多马力扩大为一万四千九百余马力，受益田亩将从二十七万亩增加到四十三万亩，估计每年可增产稻谷价值三百四十多亿元。
    这些工程共需经费二百余亿元，其中最大的是高明下泰和围机械排水工程，需经费八十二亿元。完工后每秒钟能排水八点四二立方公尺，一小时的排水量相当于五十万人口城市的一天用水。
