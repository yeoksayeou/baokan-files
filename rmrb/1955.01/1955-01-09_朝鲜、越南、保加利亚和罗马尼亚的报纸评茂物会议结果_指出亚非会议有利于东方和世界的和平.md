Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 8th.
    The "Labor News" published a commentary on the 7th, welcoming the Bogor Conference's decision to convene the Asian-African Conference.
    The commentary said that the resolution to convene the Asian-African Conference has aroused widespread response from people of all countries, especially welcomed and supported by the people of Asian countries. The commentary pointed out that the convening of the Asian-African Conference is a matter of great significance in the political life of the people of Asia and Africa.
    The commentary pointed out that opposing colonialism is the common task of the people of Asian and African countries. The people of Asia and Africa have always suffered the fate of colonial oppression and enslavement. Now, the people of Asia and Africa must firmly grasp their own destiny in their own hands. Western colonial countries can no longer ignore this change taking place in Asia and Africa.
    The commentary pointed out that the invitation of the People's Republic of China to participate in the Asian-African Conference is of particular importance. This once again proves that the relations between Asian countries have been further developed.
    The commentary said that the United States is doing its utmost to hinder the consolidation of friendly and cooperative relations between Asian countries, provoke relations between Asian countries, and attempt to create division and discord between them, so as to realize its sinister plot of "Asians fighting Asians," but this conspiracy has been constantly defeated.
    The commentary said that the Bogor Conference's resolution on convening the Asian-African Conference once again proved the great vitality of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by China and India, and China and Myanmar. This principle can be widely applied in the relations between all countries.
    The commentary finally pointed out that today, the situation in Asia is moving towards the establishment of collective peace and security. The convening of the Asian-African Conference will contribute to this development.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 7th. "People's Daily" published a commentary written by Jian Yuan on the 6th, welcoming the convening of the Asian-African Conference.
    The commentary pointed out: At a time when US imperialism and its lackeys are stepping up their activities to maintain and restore their rule in Asia and Africa, threatening the peace and national rights of the people of Asian and African countries, and continuing to pursue the policy of divide and rule and using Asians and Africans to fight Asians and Africans, holding such a conference is of particular importance.
    The commentary said: After the Second World War, Asia and Africa are no longer places where imperialists can do whatever they want and run rampant. The growing strength of the camp of peace and democracy is increasingly giving the people of Asian and African countries confidence in their future. However, US imperialism is also carrying out sabotage more and more blatantly. The people of Asia and Africa are determined to defeat the vicious conspiracies of US imperialism and its lackeys. The Asian-African Conference will strengthen the unity between the countries of these two continents against the common enemy.
    The commentary said: The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence put forward by the Prime Ministers of China and India and China and Myanmar should be the basis for strengthening friendly relations between Asian and African countries and opposing the new schemes of alienation and enslavement by American warmongers. The Bogor Conference, which has just been convened, and the upcoming Asian-African Conference will play an important role in developing economic and cultural relations between Asian and African countries. The economic and cultural exchanges between China and India, Myanmar, Indonesia, and other countries have already achieved many good results, which is an example for many Asian and African countries that have abundant resources but are suffering from colonial exploitation. Therefore, the Bogor Conference's decision to convene the Asian-African Conference is a new victory for the peaceful forces of Asia and Africa, and a heavy blow to the US imperialists who are actively preparing for war.
      Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 8th. Sofia News: The Bulgarian newspaper "Workers' Cause" commented on the Bogor Conference's resolution on convening the Asian-African Conference, saying that the South Asian Five Prime Ministers' Conference made a unanimous resolution on the issue of convening the Asian-African Conference, strengthening the cooperation of Asian countries. The strengthening of cooperation among Asian countries and the expansion and consolidation of the Asian-African peace zone are conducive to peace in the East and the world. "People's Youth Daily" published a commentary saying that the Bogor Conference's resolution on convening the Asian-African Conference is beneficial to the people of Asia and Africa, and beneficial to international peace and cooperation.
    Xinhua News Agency, January 7th. According to the Romanian News Agency, Bucharest, January 6th: "Spark" published an article entitled "Bogor Conference - A New Manifestation of the Strengthening of Unity Among the People of Asia." The article said: The decision made by the Bogor Conference shows that the people of Asian countries are more united in their common struggle for peace, independence and freedom, against colonialism, racial discrimination and economic enslavement. The decision of the Bogor Conference is not only related to the international relations of Asia, but also to the international relations of Africa, which makes this conference even more important. In Africa, hundreds of millions of people who are still, or were recently, under the colonial yoke of imperialist countries have awakened and are fighting for freedom, independence and peace.
    The article said that the convening of the Asian-African Conference proves that the voices of these countries are becoming louder on the international stage. The fact that the twenty-five countries invited to participate in the Asian-African National Conference include the People's Republic of China is of great significance, which shows that China has gained great international prestige in Asia and the world.
    The article said that the Bogor Conference resolutely condemned the use of atomic weapons, and at the same time emphasized the urgency of stopping atomic weapons tests. The Bogor Conference's decision gave a new blow to the sinister conspiracy planned by the American atomic maniacs. This proves that a strong collective force has emerged in Asia, whose goal is to defend peace and frustrate the sinister conspiracies of the enemies of peace and freedom.

    朝鲜、越南、保加利亚和罗马尼亚的报纸评茂物会议结果
    指出亚非会议有利于东方和世界的和平
    【新华社平壤八日电】“劳动新闻”七日发表评论，欢迎茂物会议关于召开亚非会议的决定。
    评论说，关于召开亚非会议的决议引起了世界各国人民的广泛反应，特别是受到了亚洲各国人民的欢迎和支持。评论指出，亚非会议的召开，是亚洲和非洲人民政治生活中具有重大意义的事情。
    评论指出，反对殖民主义是亚非各国人民的共同的任务。亚非各国人民一向遭受殖民压迫和奴役的命运。现在，亚非人民要把自己的命运紧紧地掌握在他们自己的手里。西方殖民国家再也不能无视亚非两洲发生的这种变化。
    评论指出，中华人民共和国被邀请参加亚非会议，具有特别重要的意义。这又一次证明，亚洲各国之间的关系有了进一步的开展。
    评论说，美国竭力阻碍亚洲各国友好合作关系的巩固，挑拨亚洲各国之间的关系，企图造成它们之间的分裂与不和，从而实现其“亚洲人打亚洲人”的罪恶阴谋，但是，这种阴谋已经不断遭到失败。
    评论说，茂物会议关于召开亚非会议的决议，又一次证明了中印、中缅所倡导的和平共处的五项原则的伟大生命力，这种原则完全可以广泛地应用在一切国家之间的关系中。
    评论最后指出，今天，亚洲的形势正在朝着建立集体和平和安全的方向前进。亚非会议的召开将有助于这一发展。
   【新华社河内七日电】“人民报”六日发表了坚原写的欢迎召开亚非会议的一篇评论。
    评论指出：在美帝国主义及其走狗们加紧活动、借以维护和恢复它们在亚洲和非洲的统治、威胁亚非各国人民的和平和民族权利、继续奉行分而治之和用亚非人打亚非人的政策的时候，举行这样一个会议是有特别重要的意义的。
    评论说：二次大战后，亚洲和非洲再也不是帝国主义者们为所欲为和横行霸道的地方了。和平民主阵营的力量的日益强大，越来越使亚洲、非洲各国人民对自己的前途充满信心。但是美帝国主义也越加明目张胆的进行破坏。亚非人民决心打败美帝国主义及其走狗的恶毒阴谋。亚非会议将加强这两大洲各国间反对共同敌人的团结。
    评论说：中印、中缅总理提出的和平共处的五项原则，应该是加强亚非各国间的友好关系、反对美国好战者的新的离间和奴役阴谋的基础。刚召开的茂物会议和即将召开的亚非会议都将对发展亚洲和非洲各国间的经济、文化关系起重要作用。中国和印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚等国的经济往来和文化交流已经取得了许多良好的结果，这对于有着丰富的资源但正遭受殖民主义剥削的许多亚非国家来说，是一个榜样。所以，茂物会议决定召开亚非会议，是亚非两大洲和平力量的新胜利，是对积极准备战争的美帝国主义者的一个沉重的打击。
      【新华社布拉格八日电】索非亚消息：保加利亚报纸“工人事业报”评论茂物会议关于召开亚非会议的决议说，南亚五国总理会议就召开亚非会议问题作出了一致的决议，加强了亚洲国家的合作。亚洲国家的合作的加强和亚非和平地区的扩大和巩固，有利于东方和全世界的和平。“人民青年报”发表评论说，茂物会议关于召开亚非会议的决议有利于亚洲和非洲人民，有利于国际和平和合作。
    【新华社七日讯】据罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特六日讯：“火花报”刊载了一篇题为“茂物会议——亚洲人民加强团结的新表现”的文章。文章说：茂物会议作出的决定表明，亚洲国家的人民在他们争取和平、独立和自由、反对殖民主义、种族歧视和经济奴役的共同斗争中更加团结一致了。茂物会议的决定不仅关系到亚洲的国际关系，而且也关系到非洲的国际关系，这就使得这个会议更加重要了。在非洲，仍处在、或不久以前处在帝国主义国家的殖民枷锁之下的千百万人民已经觉醒，正在为争取自由、独立和和平而斗争。
    文章说，亚非会议的召开证明，这些国家的声音在国际舞台上更加响亮了。在被邀请参加亚非国家会议的二十五个国家中包括中华人民共和国在内，这个事实有着重大的意义，这显示出中国在亚洲和全世界已经获得了巨大的国际声望。
    文章说，茂物会议坚决斥责使用原子武器，同时强调停止原子武器试验的迫切性。茂物会议的决定给予美国原子疯子策划的罪恶阴谋以一个新的打击。这证明，在亚洲已经产生了一支强大的集体力量，它的目标是捍卫和平和挫败和平和自由的敌人的罪恶阴谋。
