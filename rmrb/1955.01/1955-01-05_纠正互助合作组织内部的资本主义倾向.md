    Correcting Capitalist Tendencies Within Mutual Aid and Cooperative Organizations
    Miao Qi

    In some mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives in Xingyang County, Henan Province, there has been a tendency towards collective development of capitalism.

    One Qiao Erqiang mutual aid team put forward the slogan of “four no’s” for party members, Youth League members, cadres, and poor peasants, in order to facilitate the development of capitalist tendencies; after the unified grain purchase, the only Youth League member in the team was frequently excluded. A Zhang Xinhan mutual aid team, seeing that livestock prices were high in the west and low in the flood-stricken areas in the east, sold the three large oxen in the team to the west at high prices and then bought cheaper ones in the east. In some villages, there was a phenomenon of middle peasants spontaneously organizing "middle peasant cooperatives" that only allowed middle peasants to participate and excluded poor peasants; some existing cooperatives also began to foster capitalist ideas; they wanted to make excessive profits and "develop production" through speculating on livestock and engaging in commercial "sideline occupations."

    Currently, agricultural production cooperatives are being developed on a large scale in various places, and many mutual aid teams have been transformed into agricultural production cooperatives. However, if we do not pay attention to solving the problems mentioned above, even if such mutual aid teams are transformed into cooperatives, they will continue to collectively develop capitalism. We must pay close attention to this serious problem, and constantly educate rural cadres and the masses about the general task of the transition period and class policies, and use patient persuasion and education methods to correct this capitalist tendency.

    纠正互助合作组织内部的资本主义倾向
    缪锜
    河南省荥阳县的一些互助组和农业生产合作社中，发生了集体发展资本主义的倾向。
    有个乔二枪互助组提出党员、团员、干部、贫农“四不要”的口号，为的是发展资本主义倾向方便些；粮食统购以后，组内仅有的一个团员也经常受排斥。有个张新汉互助组，看到西路牲口价高，东路水灾地区牲口价低，就把组内三个大牛牵到西边高价卖了，再到东边买便宜的。有些村庄发生了中农自发地组织只要中农参加不许贫农参加的“中农社”的现象；有些原有的社也开始滋长资本主义思想；它们想以倒换牲口，经营商业性质的“副业”等办法，来牟取暴利，“发展生产”。
    目前各地正在大量发展农业生产合作社，许多互助组已经转成农业生产合作社。但如果不注意解决上面说的这些问题，这样的互助组即使转成合作社，还会继续集体地发展资本主义，我们必须密切注意这个严重问题，经常对农村干部和群众进行过渡时期总任务和阶级政策的教育，用耐心说服教育的方法，纠正这种资本主义倾向。
