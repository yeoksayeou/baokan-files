    The article pointed out that the convening of the Asian-African Conference has historic significance in the lives of the people in these regions and in the overall international life.
    The Korean people have always believed that maintaining and consolidating peace in Asia is entirely in line with their national interests. Therefore, the Korean people warmly congratulate the convening of the Asian-African Conference and wish the conference positive results in maintaining and consolidating peace in Asia and Africa and promoting cooperation and friendship between Asian and African countries.
    The article further stated: At the same time, the Korean people believe that in order to achieve the goals that the Asian-African Conference wants to achieve more fully, the door of the conference should be opened to some other countries in these regions that have not been invited to participate. There is no doubt that the more countries in these regions participate in the conference, the greater the achievements of the conference will be.
    The article concluded by saying that the Korean people hope that the Asian-African Conference will shatter all the malicious conspiracies of those who oppose and attempt to obstruct the conference and achieve achievements commensurate with its goals.

    支持和欢迎亚非会议的召开
    【新华社平壤九日电】“民主朝鲜报”刊载了一篇题为“朝鲜人民支持和欢迎亚非会议的召开”的文章。
    文章指出，召开亚非会议这件事，在这些地区的人民生活以及在总的国际生活中具有历史性的重要意义。
    朝鲜人民一向认为，维护和巩固亚洲的和平完全符合他们的国家利益。因此，朝鲜人民热诚地祝贺亚非会议的召开，并祝会议在维护与巩固亚洲与非洲的和平以及促进亚非各国之间的合作和友好方面能收到积极的效果。
    文章又说：同时，朝鲜人民认为，为了使得亚非会议所要实现的目标能够更加圆满地实现，会议的大门应该对这些地区内没有被邀请参加的其他一些国家敞开。毫无疑问，这些地区参加会议的国家越多，会议的成就就会越大。
    文章最后说，朝鲜人民希望，亚非会议会粉碎那些反对和企图阻挠会议的人们的一切恶毒的阴谋，得到和它的目的相称的成就。
