Chong'an Tea Farm Uses Tractors to Reclaim Tea Plantations

The large-scale reclamation of barren mountain tea plantations at the state-run Chong'an Tea Farm has begun in earnest. Now, the tea farm's tractor drivers are operating DT-54 and HT-25 tractors all day long at the foot of the Wuyi Mountains. Many wild trees and shrubs that have occupied the barren mountains for years have been uprooted one by one by the steel cables pulled by the tractors; the previously desolate land, after being plowed by the five-furrow and three-furrow plows towed by the tractors, has been transformed into beautiful new tea gardens. In recent days, farmers from nearby areas have been coming to visit in an endless stream.

The state-run Chong'an Tea Farm is a new type of tea industry experimental farm in Fujian Province that uses machinery for production. During this winter and next spring, it will reclaim about four thousand mu of tea mountains for cultivating new tea plants. This farm will be developed into a production base for Wuyi rock tea in Fujian Province.

    崇安茶场用拖拉机垦辟茶园
    国营崇安茶场大规模的垦辟荒山茶园工作已紧张开始。现在，茶场的拖拉机手们已驾驶着德特—五十四拖拉机和热托—二十五拖拉机在武夷山麓整天工作着。多年来盘据在荒山上的许多野树杂木，已经被拖拉机牵引着钢丝绳一株株连根拔掉；原先一片荒芜的土地，经过拖拉机拖带的五铧犁、三铧犁翻犁后，已变成一畦畦美丽的新园。连日来，附近各地农民前来参观的络绎不绝。
    国营崇安茶场是福建省采用机器生产的一个新型茶业试验场。今冬明春期间，将垦辟四千亩左右茶山，供培植新茶之用。这个场将发展为福建省武夷岩茶的一个生产基地。
