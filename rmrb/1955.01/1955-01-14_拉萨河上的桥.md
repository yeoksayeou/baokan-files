    The Bridge Over the Lhasa River
    By our correspondent Shen Shi
    In winter, the outskirts of Lhasa are extraordinarily tranquil. The poplars and red willows, having shed their green coats, stand bare in the *linka*. On the Lhasa River, the dried-up riverbed is spread with yellow sand and pebbles. A stream of emerald green water flows slowly towards the Yarlung Tsangpo River. Light yak-hide boats move back and forth on the water. Flocks of geese fly high in the sky, emitting long calls from time to time. Yellow ducks, never disturbed, calmly perch on the edge of the shallow water, greedily enjoying the warm sunshine.
    Since the first automobile arrived via the Kangding-Tibet Highway at the riverbank opposite the Potala Palace, the usual tranquility of the Lhasa River has been broken. Tents have been pitched on the riverbed, and cooking smoke has risen. Drivers hurry to drive the cars over, unload supplies, and then hurry eastwards again. Gasoline, grain, timber, steel frames, winches, steel cables...pile up on the riverbed. People understand in their hearts that in the coming days, a brand new bridge will appear on the Lhasa River.
    The bridge over the Lhasa River is the last bridge on the Kangding-Tibet Highway, and also the longest bridge on the entire route.
    The bridge site was determined, and bridge materials, tools, and equipment were all complete. On December 3rd, construction began.
    Many people from Lhasa City came to the bridgehead, and many eyes stared at the bridgehead. The gorgeously dressed Tibetan women strolled on the riverbank, knitting sweaters with their hands. One moment they squeezed into the crowd to look at the opposite bank, the next they stopped to point east and west at the water surface. The Tibetan old man with long braids, leading his granddaughter and followed by his family, walked slowly from the city, placed a light canvas chair on the bank. The old man raised his binoculars, looked at the opposite bank for a while, and then handed them to his son and daughter-in-law. They sat from noon to dusk. When they were thirsty, they opened their thermos and shared a cup of butter tea. When they were hungry, they took out biscuits and ate heartily. What kind of mood was this silver-haired old man in, being able to see the changes on the Lhasa River in his long-lived city? The lamas in scarlet robes walked out of the monastery in groups of three or five to the riverbank. They looked at the bridge under construction, then turned back to look at the towering Potala Palace. What were they thinking? The primary school students of Lhasa City flocked over, jumping and shouting. They drilled through the crowd, pointing at the pile driver with its giant arm one moment, and at the bulldozer emitting blue smoke the next. What were they saying?
    The Tibetan farmers who came from Mozhugongka along the Lhasa River Valley asked people as soon as they arrived at the bridgehead: "After the bridge is built, will pedestrians be allowed to pass?" "Will yaks be allowed to cross the bridge?" The questions they raised that were related to their vital interests contained a lot of bitterness! Between summer and autumn, when the Lhasa River rises, people and yaks have to wait for several hours to cross. They had seen the tragic events of people and animals being swallowed by the river. When they learned that after the bridge was built, pedestrians and yaks could pass over the bridge, happy smiles appeared on their faces. Those herders who had crossed snowy mountains and came from the grasslands, after paying homage to the Potala Palace, came to the bridgehead and asked: "When will such a road be built and such a bridge be built in our hometown?" Those Tibetan migrant workers who had made contributions in road construction came from their distant hometowns, preparing to participate in the opening ceremony. They came to the riverbed every day to help the workers carry wood. They had sweated during road construction, and they contributed their labor to the bridge over the Lhasa River.
    The people of Lhasa City were all attracted by the bridge, and the bridge construction was proceeding day and night. At night, the construction site was brightly lit, and the workers worked hard on the work platform built on the water surface. The bulldozers used on both banks of the Nujiang River were also loaded onto ferries to help with deep-water piling. Late at night, when the citizens had all entered their sleep, the workers braved the cold wind on the river and continued to work selflessly. The heavy piling sound startled the flocks of geese in the distance, causing a burst of noise, and then it was quiet again. In the early morning, the workers rowed folding boats, passing through floating ice, to send relief workers and equipment to various work platforms. During the day, the riverbank was filled with crowded people and noisy voices again.
    Engineer Gan Chengdao was responsible for the entire bridge project. He was sometimes in the tent of the bridge project team headquarters, and sometimes he took a folding boat to the work platform. All his energy was focused on the bridge.
    Crane operator Liao Jinshan, wearing a black leather hat and a blue cloth-faced leather coat, was on the work platform all day, directing the workers to drive piles. This veteran worker with more than twenty years of experience did not know how many bridges he had built. One moment he looked at the depth of the piles driven into the riverbed, the next he looked at whether the piles were driven straight. When there were problems with piling, he reminded the workers at any time with his Xiangnan accent. He had asked to work the night shift, but bridge team leader Zhou Changfa and instructor Han Xuan said: "Old Liao! Pay attention to your health! The decisive work is in the last few days!" Veteran crane operator Wu Chuntao, who has thirty years of experience, stayed on the work platform all day like Old Liao. They contributed their technology to the Kangding-Tibet Highway, and taught their technology to young workers. The bridge team grew day by day, and the number of skilled workers increased day by day. When they were building the last bridge on the highway line, looking back at the bridges they had built, and looking at the growing team, they must have felt comforted.
    The bridge piles were driven, and the most tense days of bridge construction were approaching. The commanders of the construction headquarters took turns directing the work on site day and night. The heavy steel frames, using winches and steel cables, were slowly moved from the bridge foundations on both banks to the central bridge frame, section by section. Wu Chuntao, Liao Jinshan, and Wei Yanren raised red and yellow flags respectively, standing on the steel beams more than two feet above the water surface to direct the work. The crowds of people crowded on the riverbank watched the movement of the steel frames intently. The steel frames were erected, the crossbeams and stringers were installed, and the bridge deck was paved. The commanders, engineers, and workers worked hard for seventeen days, and the deep-water part of the Lhasa River Bridge project was completed. Cheers erupted on the riverbank. People watched the trucks, one after another, pass through the bridge and drive into Lhasa City. People scrambled to squeeze onto the bridge, walking back and forth on the bridge, looking at the bridge body and the river bottom. In the evening, the setting sun shone on the bridgehead, and the newly built bridge and the magnificent Potala Palace reflected each other. The people who watched the bridge understood in their hearts that this was a bridge built on the ancient Lhasa River in a short period of time by the people sent by Chairman Mao.

    拉萨河上的桥
    本报记者　沈石
    冬天，拉萨郊野分外宁静。白杨红柳，脱去了绿色的外衣，赤条条地点缀在林卡里。拉萨河上，干涸的河滩平铺着黄沙和卵石。一泓碧绿的河水，缓缓地向雅鲁藏布江流去，轻巧的牛皮船在水上来回，雁群在高空飞翔，不时发出悠长的鸣声，从来没有人惊扰过的黄鸭，泰然自若的栖息在浅水边，贪受着和煦的阳光。
    自从第一辆汽车经康藏公路来到布达拉宫斜对岸的河边以后，打破了拉萨河上往常的宁静。河滩上搭起了帐篷，升起了炊烟。驾驶员们匆匆地将汽车开来，把物资卸下后，又匆匆地将汽车向东驶去。汽油、粮食、木材、钢架、绞车、钢丝绳……，在河滩上堆积起来了，人们心底里都明白，在最近的日子里，拉萨河上将要出现一座崭新的大桥。
    拉萨河上的桥，是康藏公路上最后一座桥，也是全线最长的一座桥。
    桥位确定了，桥料、工具、器材都齐备了，十二月三日，工程开始了。
    拉萨市多少人来到桥头，多少双眼睛盯着桥头。那服装华丽的藏族妇女，她们在河岸上蹓跶，两手不停地编织毛衣，她们一忽儿挤到人丛里，向对岸瞧瞧，一忽儿又停下来，向水面东指西划。那垂着长辫的藏族老人，牵着他的孙女儿，后面跟着他的一家人，缓缓地从城里走来，把轻便的帆布椅安置在岸边，那老人举起望远镜，向对岸望过一阵，又递给他的儿子和媳妇，他们从正午坐到傍晚，口渴了，揭开热水瓶，分享一杯酥油茶，饿的时候，拿出饼干来，痛快的吃一顿。这须发银白的老人，在他的晚年，能够在自己久居的城市，看到拉萨河上的变化，他是一种什么样的心情呢？那披着绯红袈裟的喇嘛们，三三五五的走出寺院，来到河边，他们看看正在架设的大桥，又回过头来，望望那巍峨的布达拉宫，他们在想些什么呢？那拉萨市的小学生们，他们连蹦带跳的蜂拥过来，他们在人丛中钻来钻去，他们一忽儿指着那伸出巨臂的打桩机，一忽儿指着那吐出青烟的推土机，他们在说些什么呢？
    那从拉萨河谷墨竹工卡一带来的藏族农民们，他们一到桥头，就向人打听：“桥架好了，让不让行人来往呢？”“允不允许牦牛从桥上走过呢？”他们发出这样关系切身利益的问题，是含着许多辛酸啊！夏秋之间，拉萨河水涨，人和牦牛过渡，得等上几个钟头。他们曾经见过人畜被河水吞没的惨事，当他们知道桥架好了，行人和牦牛可以在桥上通过时，他们的脸上浮出了快乐的笑容。那些翻过重重雪山，从草原上来的牧民们，朝过布达拉宫后，到了桥头，他们在问：“什么时候在我们的家乡，修这样一条路，架这样一座桥呢？”那些在筑路中立过功的藏族民工们，从家乡远道赶来，准备参加通车典礼，他们每天来到河滩上，帮助工人搬运木料。在筑路中，他们流过汗水，拉萨河上的桥，又献出了他们的劳力。
    拉萨市的人都被桥吸引住了，建桥工程日夜地进行着。夜里，工地上电灯通明，工人们在水面架好的工作台上紧张的工作，在怒江两岸使用过的推土机，也装上了渡船，帮助深水打桩。深夜，市民都进入睡乡了，工人们冒着河上的寒风，仍在忘我的劳动。沉重的打桩声，惊动了远处的雁群，发出一阵噪声，接着又静寂了。清晨，工人们划着折叠舟，穿过飘浮的冰块，将接班的人和料具，送到各个工作台上。白天，河岸上又被拥挤的人群，嘈杂的人声充塞了。
    工程师甘城道负责全部桥梁工程，他有时在桥梁工程队队部的帐篷里，有时又坐上折叠舟到了工作台上。他的全付精力都放在桥上了。
    起重工廖金山，戴着一顶黑色的皮帽，穿着一件蓝布面子的皮大衣，他成天在工作台上，指挥工人打桩，这位有着二十多年工龄的老工人，他不知道架过多少桥了。他一会儿看看桩插到河底的深度，一会儿看看桩是不是打得很直。碰到打桩有问题，他操着湘南的口音，随时提醒工人，他曾经要求上夜班，桥工队队长周长发、指导员韩瑄都说：“老廖！注意你的身体吧！决定性的工作还在最后几天哩！”有着三十年工龄的老起重工吴春涛，他和老廖一样，也是成天守在工作台上的。他们把自己的技术贡献在康藏公路上，又将自己的技术教给年轻的工人，桥工队一天天成长起来了，熟练的工人一天天增多了，他们在架设公路线上最后一座桥的时候，回想起架过的桥梁，看看日渐壮大的队伍，他们的心头当有所慰藉。
    桥桩打好了，架桥最紧张的日子临近了，修建司令部的指挥员们，都日夜轮流地在工地上亲临指挥。沉重的钢架，利用绞车、钢索，一节一节地，缓缓地从两岸的桥基向中心桥架移过去，吴春涛、廖金山、魏延仁分别地扬着红旗和黄旗，站在离水面两丈多高的钢梁上指挥，河岸上拥挤的人群，目不转睛地注视着钢架的移动。钢架架好了，横梁、纵梁安好了，桥面板铺好了，指挥员、工程师、工人们紧张劳动了十七天，拉萨河大桥深水部分的工程竣工了。河岸上掀起了欢呼，人们看着载重汽车，一辆一辆地通过大桥，开进拉萨市内，人们争着挤上大桥，在桥上走过来，又过去，看看桥身，看看河底。傍晚，斜阳照在桥头，新建的桥和壮丽的布达拉宫遥相辉映。看桥的人心里都明白，这是毛主席派来的人，在短短的日子里，在古老的拉萨河上，架起的一座大桥。
