Completion of the Xiahuayuan to Guanting Reservoir Ultra-High Voltage Power Line

    The Xiahuayuan to Guanting Reservoir section of the ultra-high voltage power transmission line of the Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, and Zhangjiakou power grid has been completed. The Xiahuayuan Power Plant officially began supplying electricity to the Guanting Reservoir on the afternoon of December 22nd last year, supporting the basic construction of the Guanting Hydropower Station. From now on, the Guanting Reservoir will not need to generate electricity with diesel engines, which will save the country a large amount of funds.

    This ultra-high voltage line is part of the Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, and Zhangjiakou power grid. In the future, this ultra-high voltage transmission line will connect the power stations and plants in Tianjin, Tangshan, Guanting Hydropower Station, Xiahuayuan, and other places to form a powerful power grid. This will provide sufficient electricity for the industrial production and daily life of the people in these areas. This line was designed and constructed entirely according to Soviet design standards. The materials used were produced by our own country. Before the official power transmission, it underwent strict acceptance and power transmission tests, proving that the quality is very good.

    The erection of this line, from design, material preparation, construction to completion, took only six months. In the construction process, the workers overcame many difficulties. The line crosses the Yanghe River, the Sanggan River, and three mountainous areas, the highest mountain being over 900 meters above sea level. Some of the power transmission tower foundations are located on the top of high mountains, but the transport workers transported a large amount of construction materials to the high mountains, ensuring the supply of materials.

    下花园到官厅水库段超高压线建成
    北京、天津、唐山、张家口电力网下花园到官厅水库段超高压送电线路已经建成。下花园发电厂已从去年十二月二十二日下午开始正式向官厅水库送电，支援官厅水电站的基本建设。从此，官厅水库可不用柴油机发电，将为国家节约大量资金。
    这条超高压线路是京、津、唐（山）、张（家口）电力网的一部分。将来通过这条超高压送电线把天津、唐山、官厅水电站、下花园等地的电站、电厂连结在一起，形成一个强大的电力网。将可以供应这些地区的工业生产和人民日常生活充足的电力。这条线路是完全按照苏联设计标准设计和施工的。所用的材料由我国自己生产。在正式送电前，曾经过严格的验收和送电试验，证明质量很好。
    这条线路的架线，从设计、备料、施工到完工，才花了六个月的时间。在施工中，职工们克服了许多困难。线路跨过洋河、桑干河，越过三个山区，最高的山海拔九百多公尺。有的架线铁塔基础座落在高山顶上，但运输工人都把大量的建设材料运到高山上去，保证了材料的供应。（宋寿裕）
