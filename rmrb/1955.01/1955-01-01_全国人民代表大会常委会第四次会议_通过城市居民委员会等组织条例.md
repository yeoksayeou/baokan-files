    NPC Standing Committee Fourth Session
    Approves Organizational Regulations for Urban Residents Committees and Other Organizations
   The Fourth Session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress was held on December 31st.

    The meeting discussed and approved the "Organizational Regulations for Urban Residents Committees," the "Organizational Regulations for Urban Sub-district Offices," and the "Organizational Regulations for Public Security Police Stations."

    During the discussion of the "Organizational Regulations for Urban Residents Committees" and the "Organizational Regulations for Urban Sub-district Offices," the meeting heard explanations from Xie Juezai, Minister of Internal Affairs, regarding these two regulations. Xie Juezai pointed out in his explanation that in recent years, the street residents' organizations in various cities have played a significant role in assisting the government to organize and educate urban street residents, implement laws, decrees, and policies, carry out various social reform movements, and handle residents' public welfare matters. The organizational forms of street residents' organizations have also seen many new creations, and they have accumulated relatively rich work experience. Xie Juezai said that residents' committees and sub-district offices were first established in cities such as Shanghai and Tianjin. Due to their suitability for the characteristics of urban street residents' work, they have been promoted in more than sixty cities across the country in the past two years. The work practice in various cities has proven that with the rapid development of urban construction, the tasks of the municipal and district people's committees in socialist construction and socialist transformation are becoming increasingly arduous, and the welfare demands of urban residents are constantly increasing. Therefore, it is very necessary to further rectify and improve street residents' organizations, to undertake the work of street residents well, so that the municipal and district people's committees can concentrate their main efforts on many major construction aspects. Xie Juezai then gave specific explanations on the nature, tasks, organization, and funding of residents' committees, as well as the establishment of sub-district offices and their importance.

    During the discussion of the "Organizational Regulations for Public Security Police Stations," the meeting heard explanations from Luo Ruiqing, Minister of Public Security, regarding this regulation. When talking about the nature of the public security police station organization, Luo Ruiqing said that the public security police station is an agency dispatched by the municipal and county public security bureaus. Under the leadership of higher-level organs and with the support of the people, public security police stations in various places have done a lot of work and played a good role in recent years. In the future, in order to further strengthen public security work and protect the people's democratic rights, it is necessary to continue to give play to its role. Regarding the powers of the public security police station, Luo Ruiqing said that the regulations stipulate a total of ten items, which clearly define its main task as: based on the principle of the people's democratic dictatorship and in accordance with the law, to do a good job in public security management and protect the people's democratic rights. Only by carrying out these tasks well can it play its due role. Luo Ruiqing finally said that basic regulations on the work style and work methods of public security police stations are also made in the regulations (draft). There are mainly two items: one is to act in accordance with the laws of the country, and the other is to rely on the support of the people. Abiding by the law and relying on the masses are the guarantees for public security police stations to do their work well.

    The meeting finally approved several items of appointments and removals.

    全国人民代表大会常委会第四次会议
    通过城市居民委员会等组织条例
   【新华社三十一日讯】全国人民代表大会常务委员会在十二月三十一日举行第四次会议。
    会议讨论和通过了“城市居民委员会组织条例”、“城市街道办事处组织条例”和“公安派出所组织条例”。
    在讨论“城市居民委员会组织条例”和“城市街道办事处组织条例”时，会议听了内务部部长谢觉哉关于这两个条例的说明。谢觉哉在说明中指出：几年来，各个城市的街道居民组织，在协助政府组织和教育城市街道居民，贯彻法律、法令和政策，开展各项社会改革运动，办理居民公共福利事项等方面，都发挥了很大的作用，街道居民组织形式也有了许多新的创造，并积累了比较丰富的工作经验。谢觉哉说：居民委员会和街道办事处这两种组织，最先是在上海和天津等城市建立的。由于它适合城市街道居民工作的特点，近两年已在全国六十多个城市推行起来。各城市的工作实践都证明：今后随着城市建设的飞跃发展，市、区人民委员会在社会主义建设和社会主义改造方面的任务日益繁重，城市居民的福利要求也不断增长；因此，进一步整顿和健全街道居民组织，把街道居民工作很好地担当起来，从而使市、区人民委员会得以集中主要力量于许多重大建设方面，是非常必要的。谢觉哉接着就居民委员会的性质、任务、组织和经费问题以及街道办事处的设置和它的重要性作了具体说明。
    会议在讨论“公安派出所组织条例”时，听了公安部部长罗瑞卿关于这个条例的说明。罗瑞卿在说明中谈到公安派出所这一组织的性质时说：公安派出所是市、县公安局的派出机关。各地公安派出所几年来在上级机关的领导下，依靠人民群众的支持，作了很多工作，起了很好的作用。今后为了进一步加强治安工作，保障人民民主权利，还需继续发挥它的作用。关于公安派出所的职权，罗瑞卿说：条例中一共规定了十项，这十项规定明确了它的主要任务就是：依据人民民主专政的原则，依照法律做好治安管理工作，保障人民民主权利。只有很好地执行这些任务，才能发挥它应有的作用。罗瑞卿最后说：关于公安派出所的工作作风和工作方法，在条例（草案）中也作了基本规定。主要是两项：一是按照国家的法律办事，一是依靠人民群众的支持。遵守法律和依靠群众，就是公安派出所做好工作的保证。
    会议最后通过了任免事项多起。
