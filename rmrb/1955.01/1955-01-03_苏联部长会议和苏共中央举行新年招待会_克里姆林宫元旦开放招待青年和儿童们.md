On this day, the St. George's Hall of the Kremlin was decorated like a fairyland. "Snowflakes" danced in the colorful lights of the illuminations. In the center of the hall stood a large fir tree, seventeen meters high. Around the fir tree appeared characters from Russian fairy tales and Soviet children's books beloved by Soviet children. At 2:00 p.m., about three thousand boys and girls poured into the hall. The children happily watched the performances by the actors of the Moscow theaters. They greeted Snow White (played by Guryayeva of the Moscow Art Theater) and Father Frost (played by Spassky of the Central Transport Theater) as if they were old friends. Various colored electric lights lit up on the fir tree, illuminating the children's happy faces. When the actors dressed in the costumes of various Soviet nationalities, holding the national flags of the various Union republics and long banners with the word "Peace" written on them, walked past the children, the children applauded them warmly.

Younger children played in the St. George's Hall, while older boys and girls danced in the Hall of Facets and other halls of the Kremlin. The children rejoiced to their hearts' content. They visited the Kremlin Armory and the historically significant palaces, and finally went home with New Year's gifts, beaming with joy.

In the evening, the Kremlin was brightly lit. More than two thousand five hundred young men and women from Moscow came here to attend the New Year's dance, along with representatives from China and other people's democratic countries. The bands for the dances in the Hall of Facets and other halls were composed of artists from Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev.
