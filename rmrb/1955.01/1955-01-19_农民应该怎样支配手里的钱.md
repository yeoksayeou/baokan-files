Editor's Note: Since this newspaper initiated the discussion "How Should Peasants Spend Their Money?" on January 12th, many people have sent letters to participate in the discussion, which shows that everyone is very concerned about this issue. We hope that rural cadres and peasants in various regions will continue to use specific people and specific events to illustrate why some peasants cannot properly spend their money and how to help them spend it correctly.

How Should Peasants Spend Their Money?
　　Money Should Be Used Wisely
　　Zhu Wanyou, Secretary of the Yao Bao Village Branch of the Chinese Communist Party in Hulan County
　　Wang Xing, Village Chief of Yao Bao Village, Hulan County

　　First, let us report some good news: Our village has 868 hectares of land (1 hectare = 10,000 square meters), and we harvested a bumper crop again in 1954, with a total grain yield of 2.5 million jin. We handed over 540,000 jin of public grain, and after deducting rations, fodder, and this year's seeds, we sold all 1.2 million jin of surplus grain (of which two-thirds are soybeans) to the state. In addition, we produced 2 million jin of sugar beets and 300,000 jin of flax, which we sold to the state-owned sugar factories and flax mills.

　　Before selling the grain, we thought of one thing – how to handle this money. This goes back to 1953.

　　The year before last, when purchasing grain, the county party secretary came to our village, helped us calculate "production, sales, and surplus," and instructed us to spend the surplus money in useful ways. We mobilized the masses to buy public bonds, save money, and purchase large-scale production tools – truly using the money wisely. Over the past year, we have seen very clearly that this is the right path. We deposit part of the money in the bank, and the state can use it for economic construction; the peasants get interest and can save the money. For example, the First Agricultural Production Cooperative used the money saved at that time to buy fishing nets, carts, horses, and farm tools in 1954. Cooperative member Tang Xiwu saved 10 million yuan, which, together with the money from selling grain now, is enough to build five new houses. Doing so benefits both the country and the peasants. If we deviate from this path, we will inevitably go astray. In the past, there were people in our village who resold grain and cloth, and wanted to become horse traders… At that time, they would rather pay more interest to borrow money to engage in business; usury would follow. If we do not guide them to use their money in the right places, they will relapse and develop capitalism. In addition, some people eat and drink lavishly as soon as they have money, wasting it. These are all wrong paths. Our village's party branch and village government must not guide the peasants down the wrong path.

　　We remember very clearly that before liberation, the vast majority of the 300 households in the village were poor peasants and hired laborers. The puppet village chief Su Yongrui's family alone had more than 400 hectares of land and 140 rooms, hiring more than 80 laborers – half the world belonged to him. At that time, three of the four members of peasant Zhu Wanyou's family worked for him, and in the end, the labor income of three people was not enough to support one sick person. What kind of life was that! No one was in the mood to produce, and in the best years, one hectare of land yielded 2,400 jin of grain. Our village is also close to the Songhua River, and we suffered floods three years out of five. When the river rose, the poor had to go hungry.

　　After liberation, the Communist Party and the People's Government led us to distribute the landlords' land, opened up 200 hectares of wasteland, and built a dam more than 20 li long along the river. In the first few years, we organized mutual aid teams, and now all the mutual aid teams in the village have been merged into five agricultural production cooperatives. Grain yield has averaged 4,400 jin per hectare. One-third of the cultivated land has been planted with cash crops, yielding double the harvest. Speaking of people's lives, it is like the morning sun, steadily rising. Now, all but 12 poor peasant households in the village live a middle-peasant or prosperous middle-peasant life.

　　Without the leadership of the Communist Party, we would never have dreamed of such a life. Therefore, whenever we encounter anything, we think of the Party, the country, and how to do things to meet the requirements of the Party and the country. In 1954, selling grain, sugar beets, and flax totaled 1.3 billion yuan for the whole village. After deducting this year's production investment and the living expenses of 1,377 people, there is at least 500 million yuan in surplus funds. We pondered and wanted to mobilize everyone to arrange this money in the following way: deposit 120 million yuan in the bank, buy 50 million yuan of construction bonds, pay 80 million yuan in shares to the credit cooperative, repay 50 million yuan owed to the supply and marketing cooperative, and the remaining money is prepared to buy fishing boats and nets, buy cattle and pigs, develop sideline production, and also prepare to build a club with seven rooms in the village... In a word: We must patiently persuade the masses not to waste money, let alone use it to develop capitalism.

　　Our village is not the only one with increased income. In all villages that have implemented the Party's policies, followed the path of mutual aid and cooperation, and continuously developed production, the peasants must have a lot of money in their hands. This is a common new problem. On the one hand, we are introducing the situation of our Yao Bao Village, and we also hope to know how other villages and townships are arranging funds.

　　Peasants in Sizhou Village Discuss How to Use Money
　　Tu Zhengfeng

　　The peasants in Sizhou Village, Xinfu Township, Fuyang County, Zhejiang Province, have sold their surplus grain, and each household has an income of several million yuan. Some peasants do not use the money to expand reproduction but waste it. On the evening of December 22, 1954, more than ten people, including the village's people's representatives, members of agricultural production cooperatives, and mutual aid team leaders, held a discussion on how to use money properly.

　　Peasant Ling Bingquan is a thrifty person who is good at making careful calculations. He introduced his experience at the symposium. He said: "My family has 7.8 mu of land. Before liberation, although we were middle peasants, my father and I worked hard from dawn to dusk, and sometimes we couldn't even get enough to eat. After liberation, the People's Government called for increased production, so I converted 2 mu of dry land into paddy fields, increasing production by an average of 300 jin per mu per year. I used to like to gamble, but now I don't gamble anymore. In the past five years, my family has built a house, and the whole family has added a lot of new clothes, and our lives have been improving year by year." After selling agricultural products, Ling Bingquan had already made arrangements for the production and life in 1955. He said: "After selling the surplus grain, I first calculated the income and expenditure: after the autumn harvest, I sold 990 jin of surplus grain, earning 700,000 yuan, plus tea making wages, selling tea, rapeseed, and piglets, totaling 1,154,000 yuan. How is this money used? I deposited 200,000 yuan in the credit cooperative as part of the agricultural capital for next year; when spring plowing comes next year, I plan to buy 80 jin of lime, 10 jin of rapeseed cake, and 5 jin each of alum and fertilizer powder. I have also prepared 135,700 yuan for plowing cattle wages. All in all, the income from selling agricultural products accounts for exactly half of the investment in production. Even so, to be honest, my life is not bad, and I often buy fish to eat; recently, I also spent 112,000 yuan to make a new set of clothes for my son."

　　Village people's representative Yao Wenji said: "The women in our village generally do not manage the household. They often take the money that their husbands prepared to buy production supplies and buy other things. Sometimes men and women even quarrel and fight over money matters. This not only affects production but also affects family harmony. If we educate women and let women and men manage the household together, with a plan for spending money, this phenomenon will not occur. For example, I manage the household with my wife, and my wife is very concerned about family income and expenditure. After the grain and tea were sold, we held a family meeting, made a production plan, and arranged the surplus money. I like to smoke, and sometimes I want to buy a pack of good cigarettes. When my wife sees it, she advises me: 'You have to save a little, put more money into the land, what are you doing smoking such good cigarettes as a farmer?' When she says that, my face feels hot, and I don't buy good cigarettes anymore. Men and women manage the household together, everyone keeps an eye on it, so my family's money is used very practically. This year, I have invested more than 686,000 yuan in production and deposited in the credit cooperative, accounting for more than half of my family's total income for the year."

　　Peasant Xie Xiaomu said: "After our symposium tonight, we will publicize to the villagers, tell everyone about the disadvantages of some people spending money indiscriminately and the advantages of Ling Bingquan and others spending money properly, compare them, and calculate the detailed accounts of production and income and expenditure. In this way, everyone will understand that spending money indiscriminately is not good for the country or for themselves, and they will find ways to use money properly."

　　Investing in Agricultural Cooperatives, the Cooperative is Good, and I am Good Too
　　Xing Bangjia, Member of Jianhua Agricultural Production Cooperative

　　I am a member of the Jianhua Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhejiang Province. After the autumn harvest, I decided to sell 2,280 jin of grain to the state. After calculating, the income from selling surplus grain, after deducting living expenses, can still leave 380,000 yuan. What is the best use for this money? I discussed it with my wife, and she said: "Use this money to buy fertilizer? The land has already been put into the cooperative; buy agricultural tools? The agricultural tools have also been put into the cooperative; invest in the cooperative? It's not worth it; save it in the bank and credit cooperative? The interest is not much, and it's troublesome to take it in and out; why don't we two build a tomb for our old age!" When she said this, I thought that this was also a good plan, so I prepared to use this money to make a tomb.

　　Later, when the grain purchase notice was issued, the village held a general meeting. The village chief said that selling surplus grain is a contribution to the country, and the money earned from selling grain should also be used appropriately. In addition to using some money to improve life, the rest of the money should be used for production to strive for greater harvests. If everyone does this, it will help the country's construction to expand year after year, and the lives of the peasants will continue to improve. These words touched my heart. That night, I thought, if I deposit 380,000 yuan in the bank, the country can increase construction funds; if I take the saved money back between March and April, I can not only get more than 10,000 yuan in interest, but also invest the money in the cooperative, I can buy more than 200 jin of fertilizer powder, which can be used to fertilize more than 40 mu of land, and it is estimated that it can increase production by more than 1,000 jin of grain. If the cooperative increases production, the income of the members will increase, the cooperative is good, and I am good too. The previous idea, the more I thought about it, the more wrong it was!

　　The next morning, my wife was cooking, and I hurriedly told her what the village chief said at the meeting. After listening, she said unhappily: "Selling surplus grain must abide by the law, and I am free to use banknotes, he doesn't need to manage it." At that time, I thought that if I didn't explain the truth to her in detail, she wouldn't be satisfied, and it wouldn't be good to have disharmony at home. So I discussed it with her again in the evening. She always said that it was better to make a tomb. I said: "Embed steel and sharp blades, use money appropriately." She said: "Embed steel and sharp blades, how to embed?" I told her that the money from selling surplus grain, in addition to items such as making clothes, should be used to expand production; I also explained that if the cooperative increases production and sells more surplus grain to the country, it will provide more strength to support national construction and liberate Taiwan. I also said: Although we are both nearly sixty years old, we are still healthy, don't rush to spend money to make a tomb. In this way, her thinking slowly cleared up, and she said with a smile: "If you don't explain the truth, it's vague, and you almost spent the money in a pile of mud!"

　　On December 23 last year, after I sent the surplus grain to the purchasing station, I deposited 380,000 yuan in the Gongyuan Credit Cooperative, ready to invest in the agricultural production cooperative in the future.

### 农民应该怎样支配手里的钱

专栏：

    编者按：本报一月十二日发起“农民应该怎样支配手里的钱”的讨论以后，已有许多人来信参加讨论，可见大家对这个问题是很关心的。我们希望各地农村干部和农民继续通过具体的人和具体的事，说明某些农民为什么不能很好地支配手里的钱，应该怎样帮助农民正确支配手里的钱。
    农民应该怎样支配手里的钱
    钱要用在刀刃上
    中共呼兰县腰堡村支部书记　朱万有
    呼兰县腰堡村村长　王兴
    先让我们报告一个好消息：我们全村八百六十八垧地（每垧一万平方公尺），一九五四年又获得了丰收，各种粮食收了二百五十万斤。我们缴了五十四万斤公粮，除去口粮、饲料和今年的籽种，还有一百二十万斤余粮（里面有三分之二是大豆）全部卖给国家。除此以外，我们还生产了二百万斤甜菜、三十万斤亚麻，卖给国家的制糖厂和亚麻纺织厂。
    还没有卖粮的时候，我们就想到了一件事——怎么处理这笔钱。这话得从一九五三年说起。
    前年购粮的时候，县委书记到我们村来，帮我们计算了“产、销、余”，指示我们把余钱花到有用的地方。我们就动员群众买公债、储蓄、置办大型生产工具，——真正是把钱用到了刀刃上。一年以来，我们看的很清楚：这是条正道。我们把一部分钱存到银行里，国家就能把它用到经济建设上去；农民得了利息，又能把钱积蓄下来。像第一农业生产合作社，一九五四年买鱼网、车马和农具，都是用的那时存的钱。社员唐希武存起来一千万元，再加上现在卖粮的钱，足够盖五间新房。这样做，对国家对农民都有好处。要是离开这条道，就一定走到歪道上去。以前，我们村里有贩粮卖布的，要当马贩子的……那时候，他们宁肯多出利钱借钱，也要捣动买卖；高利贷也就跟着来了。要是不引导他们把钱用到正当地方，他们手里有了钱，就要犯旧病，发展资本主义。另外也有些人，一有钱就大吃大喝，把钱浪费掉。这都是歪道。我们村的党支部和村政府，绝不能引导农民走歪道。
    我们还记得挺清楚：解放以前，全村三百户人家，绝大部分是贫农和雇农。伪村长苏永瑞一家就有四百多垧地、一百四十多间房子，雇八十多个扛活的——半边天下都是他的。那时，农民朱万有一家四口人，就有三口人给他扛活，到头来，三个人的劳动报酬，还不够养活一个病人。那是甚么日月啊！谁也没有心情生产，顶好的年月，一垧地打两千四百斤粮食。咱们村子又紧靠着松花江，三年两头遭水灾，江里一涨水，穷人就更得挨饿。
    解放以后，共产党和人民政府领导我们分了地主的土地，又开了二百垧荒，江沿上修起了二十多里长的大坝。头几年组织了互助组，现在全村的互助组归并成五个农业生产合作社。粮食产量平均每垧达到四千四百斤。还有三分之一的耕地，种上了经济作物，获得加倍的收成。提起人们的生活，打比方说：就像早晨的太阳，眼看着往上升。现在全村除十二户贫农外，其余全部过着中农和富裕中农的生活。
    不是共产党的领导，我们作梦也想不到这样的生活。因此，我们一遇到什么事情，都想到党，想到国家，想到怎么做才能符合党和国家的要求。一九五四年卖粮、甜菜、亚麻，统共算下来，全村有十三亿元的收入，除去今年的生产投资和一千三百七十七口人的生活消费，最少还有五亿元的余资。我们琢磨了一下，想发动大家，这样安排这笔钱：在银行储蓄一亿二千万元，买建设公债五千万元，缴信用合作社股金八千万元，还供销合作社欠款五千万元，下剩的钱准备以村或社为单位买鱼船鱼网，买牛买猪，发展副业生产，还准备在村当中修盖七间房子的俱乐部……一句话：我们要耐心地说服群众，不能把钱浪费掉，更不能拿它去发展资本主义。
    收入增多的村决不止我们这一个，凡是执行了党的政策，走互助合作的道，生产不断发展的村子，农民手里就一定有很多钱，这是个普遍存在的新问题。我们一方面把我们腰堡村的情况介绍出来，也希望知道别的村、乡是怎么安排资金的。
    泗洲村农民座谈怎样用钱
    屠正峰
    浙江富阳县新富乡泗洲村的农民卖了余粮，每户人家都有几百万元的收入。有些农民不拿钱来扩大再生产，却把钱乱花掉了。一九五四年十二月二十二日晚上，这个村的乡人民代表、农业生产合作社社员、互助组组长等十多个人举行了一次讨论如何正当地用钱的座谈会。
    农民凌炳泉是个善于精打细算的会过日子的人，他在座谈会上介绍了自己的经验，他说：“我家有七亩八分田，解放前虽是中农，但父子俩起早摸黑地干，有时还捞不到饱肚。解放后，人民政府号召增产，我就把二亩旱田改成水田，平均每年每亩增产三百斤。过去我喜欢赌钱，现在也不赌了。五年来，我家盖了一间房子，全家添了不少新衣，生活逐年上升。”出卖农产品后，凌炳泉对一九五五年的生产、生活，早已作了安排。他说：“卖余粮以后，我首先把收入和支出算了一下：秋收后卖余粮九百九十斤，收入七十万元，再加上制茶工资，卖茶叶、油菜籽和小猪，共收入一百一十五万四千元。这些钱怎么用的呢？我存信用合作社二十万元，作为明年的一部分农本；明年春耕时，我准备买石灰八十斤、菜籽饼十斤、礬和肥田粉各五斤，耕牛工资十三万五千七百元，我也都准备好了。总共算起来，卖农产品的收入，用在生产投资上的刚好占一半。尽管这样，说老实话，我的生活过得并不坏，还常买点鱼回来吃；最近我还花十一万二千元，给我儿子做了一套新衣服。”
    村人民代表姚文积说：“我们村里的女人一般都不管家。她们常常把男人准备买生产用品的钱，拿去买了其他东西。有时男人和女人还因为花钱的事互相吵嘴、打架。这不仅影响了生产，也影响了家庭和睦。如果我们向妇女进行教育，并让妇女和男人共同管家，花钱有个计划，就不会发生这个现象。比如我就是同老婆一起管家，我老婆是很关心家庭收入和支出的。粮食、茶叶卖出后，我们就开了个家庭会，订了生产计划，把余钱作了安排。我喜欢吸烟，有时还想买包好烟吸吸，我老婆见了就劝我：‘要节省点，地里多下点本，庄稼人吸那样好的香烟做什么？’她这么一说，我脸上就热烘烘的，以后我就不买好香烟了。男人女人一起管家，大家看住了，所以我家的钱都是用得实打实的，我今年投入生产的农本和存在信用社的钱有六十八万六千多元，占我家全年收入的一半还多一点。”
    农民谢小木说：“我们今晚开过座谈会后，就要向村里人宣传，把有些人乱花钱的坏处和凌炳泉等正当用钱的好处向大家说说，对比对比，算算生产和收支的细账，这样，大家就会了解乱花钱对国家对自己都没有好处，想法子正当地用钱了。”
    投资农业社、社好我也好
    建华农业生产合作社社员  邢邦家
    我是浙江省建华农业生产合作社社员。秋收后我已决定卖给国家二千二百八十斤谷。算了一下，卖余粮的收入，除了生活费用外还可剩下三十八万元。这些钱派什么用场好呢？我和老婆商量，她说：“这笔钱用来买肥料吗，土地已入社了；办农具吗，农具也入社了；给社里投资吧，不上算；存到银行和信用合作社去吧，利息不多，拿进拿出麻烦；倒不如我俩做寿坟吧！”她这一说，我想这倒也是个好打算，就准备用这笔钱来做坟。
    后来，发购粮通知单时，村里开了大会。村长说，卖余粮对国家有贡献，卖粮得到的钱也要用得适当才对，除用一部分钱改善生活外，其他的钱应当用到生产上去，争取更大的丰收。大家都这样做，就会帮助国家建设年年扩大，农民生活也会不断上升。这些话，句句打动了我的心。这天夜里我就想，如果把三十八万元存入银行，国家就可以增加建设资金；到三、四月间把储蓄的钱拿回来，不但可以拿到一万多元的利息，再把钱投入社里，就可买二百多斤肥田粉，可壅四十多亩田，估计能增产一千多斤粮食。社里增产了，社员收入多了，社好我也好。过去的想法，越想越不对！
    第二天一早，老婆正在烧饭，我忙把村长在会上说的话讲给她听。她听了，不乐意地说：“卖余粮要遵守法令，用钞票有我自由，用不着他来管。”当时我想，要是不详细和她讲道理，她不满意，弄得家里不和睦，是不好的。于是晚上我又和她商量。她总是说，还是做坟好。我说：“嵌钢嵌刀口，用钱用适当。”她说：“嵌钢嵌刀口，怎样嵌？”我就向她说，卖余粮得来的钱，除做衣裳等用项外，要用到扩大生产上去；还说明社里增产，多卖余粮给国家，支援国家建设、支援解放台湾就多一分力量。我还说：我俩年纪虽然近六十岁了，但身体还健康，不要急急地花钱做坟。这样，她的思想慢慢地也通了，笑眯眯地说：“不讲明道理，倒是模糊了，差点把钱花到烂泥堆里去！”
    去年十二月二十三日，我把余粮送到收购站以后，就把三十八万元存到龚原信用合作社，准备以后投资到农业生产合作社里。
