The U.S. imperialists, together with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, signed a so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty," openly threatening our people with war. The Chinese people resolutely oppose war, but will never be intimidated by war threats.

The Chinese people, tempered in long years of revolutionary war, should always maintain a high degree of vigilance in defending the motherland, closely watching the U.S. imperialists' sinister activities that harm world peace, hinder our liberation of Taiwan, and attempt to further invade our territorial sovereignty, such as undermining the Korean armistice, undermining the Indochina armistice, rearming Japanese militarism, organizing the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, and signing the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty." Moreover, we should closely watch the various conspiracies and tricks of the U.S. imperialist warmongers in the White House, the Pentagon, and the FBI. Any negligence of the enemy's conspiracies, burying oneself in construction, and losing revolutionary vigilance will lead to serious disasters. Therefore, we must strengthen national defense education for the broad masses of the people, so that the people of the whole country understand that without a strong national defense, there will be no peaceful construction, and without various public security and defense work, it will be difficult to carry out construction safely and smoothly. While we are enthusiastically engaged in selfless labor, we must never forget to defend the fruits of our hard work in the slightest.

The Constitution of the People's Republic of China stipulates: "Defending the motherland is the sacred duty of every citizen of the People's Republic of China." How should we fulfill this duty? This means raising the vigilance of the broad masses of the people, paying attention to the conspiracies and evil deeds of imperialism and its running dogs to sabotage our country at all times, educating the broad masses of the people to love the People's Liberation Army and support national defense construction everywhere, cultivating the broad masses of the people, especially young people, to have a strong and unyielding will, a selfless spirit of serving the public, and a healthy and strong physique, and to be prepared to respond to the call of the motherland at any time to participate in the struggle to resist armed aggression by foreign imperialism. If national defense education is done well, our modernized armed forces will have a full reserve force of manpower, material resources, and spirit.

Our people have a glorious tradition of loving the army and supporting national defense construction. Whether in the Liberation War or the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the broad masses of the people sent their best sons and daughters to join the army. On all production fronts of industry and agriculture, the army was supplied with the best quality products, as much as was needed, whenever it was needed. Supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers, caring for disabled soldiers, and resettling demobilized and retired soldiers have become good customs of the people. In border and coastal defense areas and army garrisons, the people often automatically support the army in building fortifications, capturing special agents, and cooperating in eliminating bandit troops; the thousands upon thousands of enthusiastic letters flying in from all corners of the motherland every day have become a great encouragement to the soldiers to defend the motherland more resolutely and bravely. However, after the end of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and our country's transition to large-scale economic construction, some people thought that the world was at peace. They believed that defending the motherland and strengthening national defense was only a matter for the army and had nothing to do with them. They believed that during the period of peaceful construction, the army would not fight, so there was no need to strengthen it, nor was there any need to always care for and support them. As a result, they became somewhat confused in their work. For example, some industrialists and businessmen treated military supplies orders with inferior products; some farmers believed that the requisition and use of a portion of land necessary for national defense construction hindered production; some organs used various excuses not to properly resettle demobilized and retired soldiers; some cadres and farmers refused to allow families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers to participate in agricultural production cooperatives on the grounds that they lacked labor; some people were afraid of military service. Continuing to strengthen national defense education for the masses of the people is to educate the masses of the people to know that whether it is participating in military industry and other national defense construction, or participating in the production and transportation of various military supplies orders; whether it is participating in the People's Liberation Army in accordance with the principles of the compulsory military service system, or properly resettling a family of a revolutionary martyr, a family of a soldier, a disabled soldier, a demobilized or retired soldier, or cooperating with the army to defend the border, the coast, and the economic construction of the motherland, or doing a good job of closely linking the army and the people, all are contributing to the great cause of consolidating national defense and defending the motherland, and are also gloriously fulfilling the provision that "defending the motherland is the sacred duty of every citizen of the People's Republic of China."

Our people are heroic and unyielding, full of high patriotic enthusiasm and revolutionary heroism. Countless touching heroic figures have emerged in the successive revolutionary struggles. Various heroic models have also emerged in the various constructions of our great motherland. However, as a result of the long-term enslavement of the people by the reactionary ruling class in the past, there are still some people among the masses who are greedy for life and afraid of death in the struggle against the enemy, panic and fear when the coast is bombed and harassed by the enemy, flee in a panic when dangerous accidents occur, avoid the heavy and choose the light in difficult engineering construction, and are afraid of cold, heat, and hardship when choosing jobs, and haggle over personal comfort. Strengthening national defense education is to promote the spirit of patriotism and revolutionary heroism, criticize and correct the ideas and behaviors of greed for life and fear of death and cowardice and selfishness, completely transform the bad influences left over from the old society, and establish the new morality of socialist society.

In order to strengthen national defense education for the masses of the people, party committees in various localities should attach importance to educating the broad masses of the people to regularly read newspapers and periodicals or regularly listen to the radio; should expose the military activities and special agent activities of imperialism at any time; should expand publicity on the heroic deeds in the successive revolutionary wars and the current various struggles to defend the motherland and build the motherland; should organize exhibitions that expose imperialist war conspiracies and the sabotage activities of special agents as much as possible, organize report meetings that commend our army's defense of the border and coast and the people's love for the army and support for national defense construction, or organize memorial meetings for historical anniversaries with national defense education significance; should strengthen leadership over various national defense-related tasks, and currently, in particular, should do a good job of gradually implementing the compulsory military service system; should commend the heroic figures who continue to emerge. We should also vigorously carry out sports activities, especially organizing young students to gradually implement the sports movement of "Labor and Defense System," which prepares for labor and defends the motherland, try out military training and adventure trips during vacations, and carry out national defense sports activities in places where conditions permit; so that our people, especially our young people, not only have a high degree of patriotism and the spirit of revolutionary heroism, but also have a healthy and strong physique and preliminary military knowledge, and become excellent and comprehensively developed citizens.

The Chinese people fervently demand peace, but will never beg for peace at the cost of their territorial sovereignty. We must strengthen the construction of the motherland while conducting regular national defense education for the broad masses of the people, enhance our national defense strength a hundredfold, resolutely liberate Taiwan, defend our sacred territory and sovereignty, heavily counterattack all interference and provocations by the enemy, so as to defend peace in the Far East and world peace, and our socialist construction can grow up in this peaceful cradle.

### 向人民群众经常进行国防教育

    向人民群众经常进行国防教育
    美国帝国主义同蒋介石卖国集团签订所谓“共同防御条约”，公然用战争来威胁我国人民。中国人民坚决地反对战争，但是决不会被战争威胁所吓倒。
    在长期革命战争中锻炼出来的我国人民，应该经常具有保卫祖国的高度的警惕性，密切注视着美帝国主义破坏朝鲜停战、破坏印度支那停战、重新武装日本军国主义、组织东南亚侵略集团和签订美蒋“共同防御条约”等等危害世界和平、阻挠我国解放台湾和企图进一步侵犯我国领土主权的罪恶活动，而且应该密切注视着美帝国主义的战争贩子们在白宫、在五角大楼、在联邦调查局中的种种阴谋诡计。任何忽视敌人的阴谋，埋头建设，丧失革命警惕性，就会遭受严重的祸害。因此，我们必须对广大人民群众加强国防教育，使全国人民了解没有坚强的国防力量就没有和平建设，没有各种治安保卫工作也很难安全顺利地进行建设。在我们欢欣鼓舞地进行忘我的劳动时，我们决不要丝毫忘记去保卫我们辛勤劳动的果实。
    中华人民共和国宪法规定：“保卫祖国是中华人民共和国每一个公民的神圣职责。”我们应该怎样履行这个职责呢？这就是要提高广大人民群众的警惕性，时时刻刻注意帝国主义和他的走狗破坏我国的阴谋活动和罪恶行为，教育广大人民群众处处热爱解放军和支援国防建设，培养广大人民群众、特别是培养青年具备英勇不屈的坚强意志、舍己为公的忘我精神和健康强壮的体魄，准备随时响应祖国的号召，参加抵抗外国帝国主义武装侵略的斗争。国防教育工作做好了，就会使我们现代化的武装力量得到充分的人力的、物质的和精神的后备力量。
    我国人民具有热爱军队和支援国防建设的光荣传统。无论在解放战争中和抗美援朝战争中，广大人民都把自己最优秀的儿女送去参加军队。在工农业的各个生产战线上都是用最优良的产品供给军队，要多少送多少，几时要就几时到。拥军优属、爱护荣誉军人、安置转业复员军人已经成为人民群众的优良风习。在边防海防和军队驻地，人民群众经常自动地支援军队修建工事、捉拿特务，配合消灭匪军；每天从祖国各个角落飞来的成千上万的热情的信件已经成为战士们更坚决更英勇地保卫祖国的莫大鼓舞。但是在抗美援朝战争结束、我国转入大规模经济建设以后，有一部分人以为天下太平了，他们认为保卫祖国加强国防只是军队的事、和自己无关，他们认为在和平建设时期军队不作战因而就用不着加强、也用不着随时去爱护他们和支援他们了。这样，他们作起事来就有些糊涂。比如，有的工商业者以低劣的产品来对待军需品订货；有的农民对国防建设必须征购征用的一部分土地，认为妨害生产；有的机关以种种借口不好好安置转业复员军人；有的干部和农民借口烈军属缺乏劳动力而拒绝他们参加农业生产合作社；有的人怕服兵役。对人民群众继续加强国防教育，就是要教育人民群众知道，无论是参加军事工业和其他国防建设，或者是参加各种军需品订货的生产和运输工作；无论是按义务兵役制的原则参加解放军，或者是安置好一个烈属、军属、荣誉军人、转业复员军人，或者是配合军队保卫边防、海防和保卫祖国经济建设，或者作好一件密切军民联系的工作，都是在巩固国防、保卫祖国的伟大事业中贡献了力量，也是在光荣地履行着“保卫祖国是中华人民共和国每一个公民的神圣职责”的规定。
    我国人民是英勇不屈的充满着高度爱国主义热情和革命英雄主义气概的。在历次革命斗争中不断涌现出无数可歌可泣的英雄人物。在我们伟大祖国的各项建设中也产生出各种英雄模范人物。但是，由于过去的反动统治阶级长期奴役的结果，在人民群众中至今也还有一些人在对敌斗争中贪生怕死，在沿海遭到敌人轰炸骚扰时惊惶恐惧，在危险事故发生时慌乱逃跑，在艰苦的工程建设中避重就轻，在选择工作岗位时怕冷、怕热、怕苦，斤斤计较个人的舒适。加强国防教育，就是要发扬爱国主义和革命英雄主义的精神，批判和纠正那种贪生怕死和懦弱自私的思想和行为，彻底改造旧社会所残留下来的坏影响，树立社会主义社会的新道德。
    为了加强对人民群众进行国防教育，各地党委应该重视教育广大人民群众，经常阅读报纸刊物或者经常收听广播；应该随时揭露帝国主义的军事活动和特务活动；应该扩大宣传历次革命战争中和目前保卫祖国、建设祖国的各种斗争中的英雄事迹；应该尽可能组织揭露帝国主义战争阴谋和特务分子破坏活动的展览会，组织表扬我国军队保卫边防、海防和人民群众热爱军队、支援国防建设的报告会，或者组织具有国防教育意义的历史纪念日的纪念会；应该加强领导有关国防的各项工作，目前特别是要作好逐步推行义务兵役制的工作；应该表扬那些不断涌现出来的英雄人物。还应该大力开展体育活动，特别是组织青年学生逐步推行准备劳动和保卫祖国即“劳卫制”的体育运动，在假期试办军事训练和探险旅行，在有条件的地方开展国防体育活动；使我国人民特别是我国青年不只是具有高度的爱国主义和革命英雄主义的气魄，而且具有健康强壮的体魄和初步的军事知识，成为优秀的全面发展的公民。
    中国人民热烈地要求和平，但是决不会用自己的领土主权作代价来乞求和平。我们必须在加强建设祖国的同时，向广大的人民群众进行经常的国防教育，百倍地增强我国的国防力量，坚决解放台湾，保卫我国神圣的领土和主权，沉重地回击敌人的一切干涉和挑衅，才能保卫远东和平和世界和平，我国社会主义建设才能在这种和平的襁褓中成长起来。
