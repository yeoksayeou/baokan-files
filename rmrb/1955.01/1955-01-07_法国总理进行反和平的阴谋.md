Xinhua News Agency, January 6th: TASS, Paris, January 5th: According to Parisian newspapers, French Premier Mendès France is about to visit Italy.

    "Combat" quoted well-informed sources as saying: Mendès France will meet with Italian Prime Minister Scelba and Foreign Minister Martino in Rome, and then visit the Vatican.

    "L'Aurore" said: Mendès France will go to West Germany from Italy to meet with Adenauer.

    "L'Humanité" pointed out: Mendès France's trip, shortly after the National Assembly approved the Paris Agreements, is to establish the Franco-German-Italian "triangular alliance" that the Vatican has long dreamed of.

    "L'Humanité" believes that Mendès France's visits to Italy, the Vatican, and West Germany are part of an anti-peace conspiracy.
Xinhua News Agency, January 6th: Bonn dispatch: A West German government spokesman announced on the 5th that French Premier Mendès France and West German Chancellor Adenauer are scheduled to hold talks at the end of next week. Soudou, Assistant to the Director of the French Premier's Office, arrived in Bonn on the 5th to prepare for the talks together with the French High Commissioner to Germany, François-Poncet, and senior officials of the West German Foreign Ministry.

    Political commentators believe that the arrangement for this meeting is due to differences of opinion between France and West Germany on the Saar issue. "Le Figaro" pointed out: The main issue to be discussed at this meeting—the Saar issue—is of a "rather delicate" nature.

    It is known that when the French National Assembly passed the bill on rearming West Germany and allowing West Germany to participate in the "Western European Union," it made West Germany's acceptance of the agreement on the Saar issue signed by Mendès France and Adenauer a condition for the entire Paris Agreements to take effect. However, this agreement, which allows France to continue controlling the Saar, has aroused dissatisfaction and criticism from parties in West Germany. Adenauer had to tell members of parliament during the first reading debate on the ratification of the Paris Agreements in the West German Bundestag in mid-December 1954 that he would try to hold further talks with Mendès France on the Saar agreement.

    法国总理进行反和平的阴谋
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社巴黎五日讯：据巴黎报纸报道，法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯即将访问意大利。
    “战斗报”援引消息灵通人士的话说：孟戴斯—弗朗斯将在罗马会晤意大利总理谢尔巴和外交部长马蒂诺，然后访问梵蒂冈。
    “震旦报”说：孟戴斯—弗朗斯将从意大利去西德，和阿登纳会晤。
    “人道报”指出：孟戴斯—弗朗斯在国民议会批准巴黎协定后不久作这次旅行，是为了建立梵蒂冈早就梦想的法、德、意“三角联盟”。
    “人道报”认为，孟戴斯—弗朗斯访问意大利、梵蒂冈和西德，是进行反和平的阴谋。
    【新华社六日讯】波恩消息：西德政府发言人在五日宣布：法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯同西德总理阿登纳预定要在下周末举行会谈。法国总理办公厅主任助理苏杜已经在五日到达波恩，同法国驻德高级专员弗朗索瓦—庞赛以及西德外交部高级官员共同进行会谈的准备工作。
    政治评论员们认为，安排这次会谈，是因为法国和西德在萨尔问题上发生了意见分歧。“费加罗报”指出：要在这次会谈中讨论的主要问题——萨尔问题，是具有“相当微妙”的性质的。
    大家知道，法国国民议会在通过重新武装西德和让西德参加“西欧联盟”的法案时，把西德接受孟戴斯—弗朗斯和阿登纳签订的有关萨尔问题的协议作为整套巴黎协定生效的条件。但是这个规定由法国继续控制萨尔的协议却在西德引起朝野党派的不满和非议。阿登纳不得不在一九五四年十二月中旬西德联邦议院进行关于批准巴黎协定的一读辩论时向议员们表示，他将设法同孟戴斯—弗朗斯再度举行关于萨尔协议的商谈。
