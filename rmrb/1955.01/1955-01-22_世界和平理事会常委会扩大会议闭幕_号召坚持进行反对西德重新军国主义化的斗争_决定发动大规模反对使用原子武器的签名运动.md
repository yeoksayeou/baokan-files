Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 20th: The enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council closed on the 19th.

    At the meeting on the 19th, many representatives continued to speak.

    The representative of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, Norman, spoke, demanding the unconditional prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons and arguing that anyone who dares to use these weapons to endanger all of mankind should be declared a war criminal.

    The Polish representative, Infeld, said that the Polish people stand in solidarity with the French people who are engaged in a heroic struggle against the Paris Accords. The struggle against West German remilitarization is a matter of vital concern to Poland, as it is to France and other European countries.

    The Secretary-General of the International Federation of Teachers' Unions, Paul Delanoue, assured the meeting that the International Federation of Teachers' Unions would do its best to launch a large-scale campaign to ban atomic weapons.

    The meeting listened attentively to the speech of Professor Ikuo Yasui, the Japanese representative. In his speech, he pointed out that the National Convention of the Japanese People Demanding the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Weapons, held in Tokyo on January 16, adopted a resolution stipulating that an international conference demanding the prohibition of the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons would be held in Hiroshima on August 6. The convention also passed a resolution demanding the prohibition of the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons. He said that the movement to ban these weapons has become a nationwide movement in Japan. The Japanese people remember the lessons of history very clearly, especially the lessons of the Second World War. Now, they abhor war. The bombing of peaceful residents of Hiroshima and Nagasaki with atomic bombs and the hydrogen bomb tests conducted by the Americans in 1954 have made the Japanese people clearly aware of the horrors that a new war might bring to them. Yasui invited representatives of the World Peace Council to participate in the work of the initiating committee of the Hiroshima International Conference demanding the prohibition of the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

    Eugénie Cotton, Chairman of the Women's International Democratic Federation, spoke about the great role that women in all countries must play in the struggle against West German remilitarization and against the use of atomic weapons. She said that a world conference of mothers defending children, opposing war, advocating disarmament and friendship between peoples of all countries will be held this summer, which is a major contribution to the struggle waged by peace-loving people of all countries.

    Guo Moruo, the representative of the People's Republic of China, then spoke. He believed that the decision of the North Atlantic Group Council to openly prepare for atomic war was a serious provocation to mankind. He said that the Chinese people and the Asian people oppose the use of atomic weapons and any experiments with such weapons. We have not forgotten that the militarists in the United States repeatedly clamored for the use of atomic weapons against the people of Korea and China during the Korean War and after the Korean War. They also used atomic bombs to threaten the Vietnamese people. We cannot forget that the United States is occupying our Taiwan and is supporting the Chiang Kai-shek group, which is preparing to carry out various provocations. The US government and Chiang Kai-shek concluded a military treaty, interfered in our country's internal affairs, and are currently preventing the Chinese people from liberating their own territory.

    The Turkish representative, Nazim Hikmet, pointed out that the issue of the use of atomic weapons by NATO countries has a direct impact on the interests of Turkey and the countries of the Middle East and Near East.

    The Argentine representative, Grancelli, said that Argentine peace advocates are doing their best to carry out a movement to ban atomic weapons with the participation of people from all walks of life.

    Next, the Soviet representative, Fadeyev, spoke. He said that the peace-loving people of the world will make it impossible for any government to launch an atomic war.

    Also speaking were: Bouchama from Algeria, Suroso from Indonesia, Dabo Seye from Black Africa, Teitelbaum from Chile, and Bertolini from the International Federation of Resistance Fighters and Victims of Fascism.

    After a recess, the meeting discussed and unanimously adopted the declaration and appeal to the people of Europe of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council.

    Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, then spoke. He asked the representatives to launch a large-scale international campaign against the use of atomic weapons. Joliot-Curie then read out the appeal to the people of the world. When the appeal to the people of the world was unanimously adopted by the participants in the meeting, everyone was in a very enthusiastic mood. They expressed their support for this document with warm cheers.

    Subsequently, all the participants in the meeting signed the appeal to the people of the world, thereby launching a worldwide campaign to collect signatures for this extremely important document.

    After the closing speech by the Indian representative, Sunderal, the enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council was declared closed.

    世界和平理事会常委会扩大会议闭幕
    号召坚持进行反对西德重新军国主义化的斗争
    决定发动大规模反对使用原子武器的签名运动
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社维也纳二十日讯：世界和平理事会常务委员会扩大会议在十九日闭幕。
    在十九日会议上继续有许多代表发言。
    国际民主法律工作者协会代表诺曼发言，他要求无条件禁止原子武器和氢武器，并且认为敢于使用这些武器来危害全人类的人应该被宣布为战争罪犯。
    波兰代表英费尔德说，波兰人民同正在进行反对巴黎协定的英勇斗争的法国人民是一致的，反对西德重新军国主义化的斗争，对于波兰正如对法国和其他欧洲国家一样，是有着切身关系的事情。
    教育工会国际总书记保罗·德拉努向会议保证，教育工会国际将尽力开展一次争取禁止原子武器的大规模运动。
    会议注意地倾听了日本代表安井郁教授的发言。他在发言中指出，一月十六日在东京举行的日本人民要求禁止原子武器和氢武器的全国大会通过决议，规定八月六日在广岛举行要求禁止使用原子武器和氢武器的国际会议，这个大会还通过了要求禁止使用原子武器和氢武器的决议。他说，要求禁止这些武器的运动在日本已成为全国规模的运动。日本人民非常清楚地记得历史的教训、特别是第二次世界大战的教训。现在，他们厌恶战争。用原子弹轰炸广岛和长崎的和平居民的事件以及美国人在一九五四年进行的氢弹试验，已经使日本人民清楚地认识到一次新战争可能为他们带来的恐怖。安井郁邀请世界和平理事会的代表们参加要求禁止使用原子武器和氢武器的广岛国际会议的发起委员会的工作。
    国际民主妇女联合会主席欧仁妮·戈登讲到各国妇女在反对西德重新军国主义化和反对使用原子武器的斗争中必须起的巨大作用。她说，一个世界母亲保卫儿童、反对战争、拥护裁军和各国人民之间的友谊大会将在今年夏天开会，这是对各国爱好和平的人民所进行的斗争的一个重大贡献。
    中华人民共和国代表郭沫若接着发言。他认为，北大西洋集团理事会关于公开准备原子战争的决定，是对人类的严重挑衅。他说，中国人民和亚洲人民反对使用原子武器和用这种武器进行任何试验。我们并没有忘记，美国的军国主义分子在朝鲜战争期间和在朝鲜战争结束后一再叫嚷要用原子武器来对付朝、中两国人民。他们也用原子弹来威胁越南人民。我们不能忘记美国正占领着我国的台湾，正在扶植准备进行各种挑衅的蒋介石集团。美国政府和蒋介石缔结军事条约，干涉我国的内政，而且目前正在阻挠中国人民解放他们自己的领土。
    土耳其代表纳齐姆·希克梅特指出，北大西洋集团国家使用原子武器的问题对于土耳其和中东及近东国家的利益有着直接影响。
    阿根廷代表格兰西利说，阿根廷和平拥护者正在尽最大的力量开展一个有各阶层人士参加的禁止原子武器的运动。
    接着，苏联代表法捷耶夫发言。他说世界爱好和平的人民将使任何一国的政府不可能发动原子战争。
    发言的还有：阿尔及利亚代表布夏马、印度尼西亚代表苏罗梭、黑非洲代表达波赛、智利代表特脱尔鲍姆和抵抗运动战士及受法西斯迫害与囚禁者国际联合会代表伯尔托利尼。
    休息以后，会议讨论了并且一致通过了世界和平理事会常务委员会的宣言和告欧洲人民书。
    世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里接着发言。他要求代表们发动一个大规模的反对使用原子武器的国际性运动。约里奥—居里然后宣读了告全世界人民书。当告全世界人民书被会议的参加者一致通过的时候，大家的情绪非常热烈。他们用热烈的欢呼表示他们对于这个文件的支持。
    接着，会议的所有参加者在告全世界人民书上签字，从而开始了一个为这项极其重要的文件征集签名的世界规模的运动。
    在印度代表森德拉尔致闭幕辞以后，世界和平理事会常务委员会扩大会议宣告闭幕。
