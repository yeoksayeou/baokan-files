Workers building the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, having completed the Chengdu-Guangyuan section, are now braving wind and snow and are working intensely on the various projects for the 140-plus kilometers from Guangyuan to Lueyang, Shaanxi, striving to lay the rails from Xujiahe, Guangyuan, to Lueyang Station this year. This section of the project is being constructed in the Daba Mountains and on the Jialing River on the border of Sichuan and Shaanxi, and the project is very arduous. There are several tunnels longer than one kilometer, as well as two large bridges across the Jialing River and many tall retaining walls. The earth and stone excavation and filling for the roadbed amounts to hundreds of thousands of cubic meters per kilometer. In order to accelerate the construction of the project, many construction sites are promoting the Soviet experience of "mass blasting method" for mountain opening, and key projects have begun to use mechanical construction.

    修筑宝成铁路的工人
    争取在今年铺轨到略阳
    修筑宝成铁路的工人们，在完成了成都广元段工程后，现正冒着风雪，开始紧张修筑广元到陕西略阳的一百四十多公里的各项工程，并争取在今年把钢轨由广元须家河铺到略阳车站。这一段工程，施工在四川、陕西边界的大巴山脉和嘉陵江上，工程非常艰巨。长达一公里以上的隧道就有好几座，还有两座跨嘉陵江大桥和许多座高大的御土墙。路基挖填的土石方，一公里中就达十几万方。为加速工程修筑，许多工地推广苏联“大量爆破法”的开山经验，重点工程并开始使用机械施工。
