What's the Calculation?
Hua Rongxuan

At the end of November 1954, Jin County, Hebei Province, held an internal material exchange meeting for state-owned commerce and cooperatives throughout the county. At this meeting, the county's state-owned cotton yarn and cloth company and the monopoly company both overfulfilled their transaction plans, thereby completing or even overfulfilling their sales plans for the fourth quarter; however, the county's state-owned department store only completed a little over 80 percent of its transaction plan. Why was the department store's plan completed so poorly?

Before the internal material exchange meeting, the Jin County Finance and Economics Committee stipulated that state-owned commercial enterprises should exhibit all their inventory for the purchasing agents of grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives to inspect, so as to facilitate their purchases. However, the Jin County State-Owned Department Store, which had an inventory of more than 1,300 kinds of goods, only exhibited more than 1,100 kinds at the meeting. Furthermore, when introducing inventory to the purchasing agents of grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives, the "Inventory Details List" that was distributed only listed 801 kinds, many of which were only exhibited and not available for purchase. As a result, hundreds of goods were "imprisoned" in the warehouse, unable to meet with the purchasing agents of grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives, and therefore unable to be delivered to the vast countryside.

According to the person in charge of the department store, many of their goods were not exhibited because "the inventory is full of slow-selling and unpopular items." However, after an inspection by the meeting, it was found that many of the unexhibited goods were suitable for the needs of the masses, such as thick wool-blend socks and flannel shirts, each in hundreds of dozens, which were neither exhibited as samples nor listed in the "Inventory Details List"; a total of 150 dozens of four-ply cotton socks and single-ply cotton socks, only the samples were exhibited, but were not listed in the "Inventory Details List"; gold pens and fountain pens were stocked in 39 kinds, but the "Inventory Details List" only listed 15 kinds; over a hundred dozens of "Prosperity," "All Joy" and other brands of fountain pens were not listed in the "Inventory Details List"...

The Jin County Department Store also lacked sincerity in helping grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives make purchases. The department store only sent two cadres to participate in the business activities of two groups at the internal material exchange meeting, and did not send anyone to participate in the business activities of the other three groups. Since department store goods are complex, and grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives had not operated many department store goods, they could not get help from the department store when purchasing goods, therefore, the purchases of department store goods by various grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives were restricted.

The Jin County Department Store's approach has harmed itself and others. Since the fourth quarter of last year, its sales plan has been completed very poorly (the plan for October was only a little more than half completed, and the plan for November was less than one-third completed by mid-month); but the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives operate few varieties and their inventory is generally sold out in only five or six days…

People can't help but ask: Now is the peak season for material exchange between urban and rural areas. The Jin County Department Store is unwilling to send a large number of stocked goods to the hands of the peasant masses through grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives. What's the calculation? Where is the policy ideology of serving production and consumers? This is something that the leading cadres of the Jin County State-Owned Department Store should "examine themselves" about!

    打的什么算盘
    华荣轩
    河北省晋县在一九五四年十一月底召开了一个全县国营商业和合作社的内部物资交流会。在这次会上，县国营花纱布公司和专卖公司都超额完成了成交计划，因此也完成甚至超额完成了第四季度销售计划；但是县国营百货商店的成交计划却只完成了百分之八十多一点。为什么百货商店的计划完成得这样差呢？
    在举行内部物资交流会前，晋县财政经济委员会曾规定国营商业应该把自己全部库存的商品展览出来，以供各基层供销合作社采购员参观，便利各基层供销合作社进货。但拥有库存商品一三○○余种的晋县国营百货商店在会上只展览出一一○○余种；向基层供销合作社采购员介绍库存商品时，印发的“库存明细表”上又只列了八○一种，其中很多商品还只是展览一下，而不让买的。这样，就使得数百种商品被“禁闭”在仓库里，无法和各基层供销合作社的采购员见面，也就无法通过基层供销合作社送到广大农村里去了。
    据百货商店的负责人说：他们的很多商品没有展览出来，是因为“库存净是冷背货”。可是经会议派人进行检查结果，发现没有展览出来的商品有很多是适合群众需要的，如：厚线狼狗袜，绒衣各百打，既未展览样品，又未列入“库存明细表”，四股棉毛袜和一字棉毛袜共一五○打，只展览了样品，未列入“库存明细表”；金笔、钢笔库存三九种，“库存明细表”只列出十五种；“繁荣”、“全乐”等牌号钢笔百余打，没有列入“库存明细表”……
    晋县百货商店对帮助基层供销合作社进货也是缺乏诚意的。百货商店这次只派了两名干部参加内部物资交流会的两个小组业务活动，其他三个小组的业务活动，就没有派人参加。由于百货商品复杂，基层供销合作社对好多百货商品没有经营过，在进货时又得不到百货商店的帮助，因此，各基层供销合作社对百货商品的进货受到了限制。
    晋县百货商店这种做法的结果是害了自己又害了别人，去年第四季度以来，它的销售计划完成的很差（十月份计划只完成一半稍多一点，十一月份计划至中旬完成还不到三分之一）；但基层供销合作社经营的品种不多，库存一般只销五、六天，……
    人们看了不禁要问：现在正是城乡物资交流旺季，晋县百货商店库存大批商品不愿通过基层供销合作社送到农民群众手里去，这打的什么算盘呢？为生产为消费者服务的政策思想何在呢？这是值得晋县国营百货商店的领导干部“反躬自省”的吧！
