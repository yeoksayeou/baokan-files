On January 8th, tricycle workers and the No. 8 Squad of the Traffic Brigade of the Public Security Bureau in Shanghai's Jiangning District held a symposium. At the meeting, tricycle workers criticized their own behaviors of violating traffic regulations such as liking to drive in the fast lane and pretending not to hear when people's police called on them to turn on their lights at night; the people's police also criticized their own shortcomings of being harsh towards workers who violated traffic regulations. Everyone also offered suggestions to each other and expressed their intention to further unite and improve traffic on the roads.

On the evening of the 12th, more than 2,600 tricycle workers and people's police from the Jiangning District and the No. 8 Squad held a joint celebration at the Huxi Workers' Club. They played cards and chess together, as intimately as a family. The tricycle workers performed the Huai opera "Planting Barley" and "Double Grinding." The people's police performed cross-talk and ballads. A friendly basketball match was also held on the court.

Many familiar tricycle workers and people's police shook hands and greeted each other at the celebration. Tricycle worker Sun Changgao warmly shook hands with the people's police Yu Changde, whom he considered "troublesome." As soon as people's police Zhu Changkun entered the theater, several tricycle workers squeezed out seats and pulled him down to sit.

    人民警察和三轮车工人联欢
    一月八日，上海市江宁区的三轮车工人与公安局交通大队第八中队的人民警察举行了一次座谈会。会上三轮车工人批判了自己爱走快车道、晚上人民警察喊点灯装听不见等违反交通规则的行为；人民警察也批判了自己对待违反交通规则的工人态度生硬的毛病。大家还互相提意见，并且表示要进一步团结，搞好马路上的交通。
    十二日晚上，在沪西工人俱乐部里，江宁区的三轮车工人和第八中队的人民警察一共有二千六百多人又进行了联欢。他们在一块打扑克、下象棋、亲热得像一家人。三轮车工人演出了淮剧“种大麦”、“双推磨”。人民警察表演了相声和说唱。在球场上还举行了篮球友谊赛。
    许多相熟的三轮车工人和人民警察在联欢会上都握手打招呼。三轮车工人孙常高亲热地和他认为“爱找麻烦”的人民警察于常德握手。人民警察朱长昆一走进剧场，马上就有几个三轮车工人挤出了位子拉他坐下。
