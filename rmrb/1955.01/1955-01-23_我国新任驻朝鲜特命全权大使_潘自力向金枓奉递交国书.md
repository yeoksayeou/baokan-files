Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 22nd: Our new Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Pan Zili, accompanied by Counselor of the Embassy Gan Yetao, Xue Chunpu, and others, presented his credentials to Kim Tu-bong, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, on the morning of the 21st.

Present at the ceremony were Kang Ryang-uk, Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Foreign Minister Nam Il, Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Pang Seung-jik, and Director of the Second Department Seo Cheol.

Ambassador Pan Zili delivered a speech of greetings to Chairman Kim Tu-bong upon presenting his credentials, to which Chairman Kim Tu-bong responded with a speech.

Ambassador Pan Zili's speech of greetings:

Respected Chairman Kim Tu-bong:

I am honored to present to you the credentials from the Chairman of the People's Republic of China appointing me as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Chairman, as I present my credentials, I would like to express, on behalf of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese people, our highest respect to you and the Korean people.

The great victory of the Korean armistice won by the heroic Korean people is a powerful blow to the conspiracy of the American imperialists to launch another world war, thus strengthening and enhancing the confidence of peace-loving people all over the world in striving for lasting peace and opposing wars of aggression. After the Korean armistice, the Korean people victoriously completed the preparatory work for restoring and developing the national economy, began a large-scale three-year plan for restoring and developing the post-war national economy, and have achieved remarkable results. All of this proves the fortitude and bravery of the heroic Korean people. The Chinese people deeply admire this, and are also convinced that the Korean people will overcome all difficulties and obstacles and continue to achieve new and more brilliant victories in the great struggle for the peace, unification, independence and democracy of their motherland, and in the cause of restoring and developing the national economy.

The Chinese and Korean people have historically been as close as lips and teeth, sharing weal and woe, especially in the last half-century. The militant friendship between the two peoples forged in the struggle against armed aggression by American imperialism has become a powerful factor in safeguarding world and Asian peace. The two visits of the Korean government delegation headed by Marshal Kim Il-sung to China and the signing of the Sino-Korean Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement in November 1953 have further promoted the mutual assistance and friendly relations between China and Korea. This ever-increasing solidarity and friendly relationship will undoubtedly continue to contribute to guaranteeing peace in Asia and the world.

Chairman, as I present my credentials to you, I would like to assure you that I will contribute all my strength to further consolidate and develop the brotherly friendship between the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. At the same time, I also hope that I will receive your full support and assistance and that of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in carrying out this important mission.

Chairman Kim Tu-bong's reply:

Ambassador:

I am very pleased to accept your credentials as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People's Republic of China to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

The historically unbreakable friendship and solidarity between the Korean and Chinese people has been further consolidated and developed in the course of the fierce war against the common enemy, the American imperialist armed aggressors, and during the period of post-war reconstruction by the Korean people to achieve the peaceful reunification of their country.

Since the great Chinese people defeated the domestic and foreign reactionary forces and declared the establishment of the people's regime—the People's Republic of China—the tremendous achievements made in consolidating the people's democratic system and in the tenacious struggle to build socialism have made great contributions to Asian security and world peace. The Korean people celebrate and value such achievements of the Chinese people with infinite joy, just as they would their own. The Korean people firmly believe that the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China, with its huge population of 600 million, should not be trampled upon in the international arena, and warmly welcome the People's Republic of China's foreign policy of peaceful coexistence. The Korean people support and support the just demand of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan, an inseparable part of China's territory still occupied by American imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek remnant clique, and are confident that the Chinese people will surely win victory in this just struggle.

The heroic Chinese People's Volunteers played a huge role in safeguarding the victory of the Korean people in the Fatherland Liberation War waged by the Korean people against American imperialist aggressors. Moreover, after the armistice, the fraternal Chinese people continued to provide the Korean people with enormous material and spiritual assistance. In particular, according to the Korean-Chinese Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement signed in November 1953, the People's Republic of China provided the Korean people with huge assistance amounting to 800 billion yuan, which has played a huge role in the successful completion of our people's economic recovery and construction. For such great assistance, the entire Korean people would like to express their heartfelt and profound gratitude to the great Chinese people.

The Korean people will do their utmost to strive for the complete unification, independence and prosperity of their country, and to develop the friendship, solidarity and close cooperation between Korea and China, which is an important guarantee for maintaining peace in the Far East and the world.

Ambassador, I am convinced that you will receive the full assistance of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, and myself in fulfilling your noble mission of strengthening the friendly relations between our two countries and for our common struggle for peace and democracy.

    潘自力大使的颂词敬爱的委员长同志：
    我荣幸地向您递交中华人民共和国主席任命我为驻朝鲜民主主义人民共和国特命全权大使的国书。
    委员长同志，在我递交国书时，我谨代表毛泽东主席和中国人民向您和朝鲜人民致崇高的敬意。
    英雄的朝鲜人民所赢得的朝鲜停战的伟大胜利，对于美帝国主义者企图发动另一次世界大战的阴谋是一个有力的打击，从而坚定并增强了全世界爱好和平人民争取持久和平、反对侵略战争的信心。朝鲜停战后，朝鲜人民又胜利地完成了恢复和发展国民经济的准备工作，开始了大规模的恢复和发展战后国民经济的三年计划，并且获得了显著成就。这一切都证明了英雄的朝鲜人民的刚毅和勇敢，中国人民对此深为钦佩，同时也确信：朝鲜人民在为祖国的和平、统一、独立和民主所进行的伟大斗争中，在恢复和发展国民经济的事业中，必能克服一切困难和阻挠，继续获得新的、更辉煌的胜利。
    中国人民和朝鲜人民在历史上尤其是近半世纪以来，一向唇齿相依，休戚与共。两国人民在反对美帝国主义武装侵略的斗争中所结成的战斗友谊已经成为保卫世界和亚洲和平的强有力的因素。以金日成元帅为首的朝鲜政府代表团两次光临中国和一九五三年十一月中朝经济及文化合作协定的签订，更使中朝两国的互助友好关系获得了重大的发展。这种日益增强的团结和友好关系，无疑地将对保障亚洲和世界和平继续作出贡献。
    委员长同志，在向您递交国书时，我谨向您保证：我将为进一步巩固并发展中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国之间的兄弟般友谊而贡献出我的一切力量。同时我也希望，我在执行这项责任重大的使命时，能够得到您和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府方面一切支持和协助。
    金枓奉委员长的答词大使同志：
    我非常愉快地接受您被任命为中华人民共和国驻朝鲜民主主义人民共和国特命全权大使的国书。
    朝鲜人民和中国人民之间所结成的历史性的牢不可破的友谊和团结，在反抗共同敌人美帝国主义武装侵略者的残酷战争过程中和在朝鲜人民为实现自己祖国的和平统一而进行战后恢复建设的时期中，已得到进一步的巩固和发展。
    伟大的中国人民自从战胜了国内外的反动势力，宣布建立人民政权——中华人民共和国以来，在巩固人民民主制度和为建设社会主义的顽强斗争中所取得的巨大成果，对亚洲的安全和世界的和平做出了巨大的贡献。朝鲜人民像对待自己的成果一样，无限欢欣地祝贺和重视中国人民的这种成果。朝鲜人民坚决主张，拥有六亿巨大人口的中华人民共和国在国际舞台上的合法地位不应被蹂躏，并热烈欢迎中华人民共和国关于和平共处的对外政策。朝鲜人民支持和声援中国人民为解放仍被美帝国主义和它的走狗蒋介石残余集团所盘踞的中国不可分割的领土——台湾的正义要求，并确信中国人民必将在这一正义斗争中获得胜利。
    英雄的中国人民志愿军在朝鲜人民为反抗美帝国主义侵略者而进行的祖国解放战争中，对保障朝鲜人民的胜利起了巨大的作用。而且在停战以后，兄弟般的中国人民继续给予朝鲜人民以物质上和精神上的巨大援助。特别是根据一九五三年十一月签订的朝中经济及文化合作协定，中华人民共和国给予朝鲜人民的达八万亿元的巨大援助，对我国人民经济恢复建设的胜利完成，起着巨大的作用。对于这样巨大的援助，全体朝鲜人民谨向伟大的中国人民致以衷心的深切感谢。
    朝鲜人民将为争取自己祖国的完全统一、独立和富强，为发展作为维护远东和世界和平的重要保证之一的朝中两国间的友谊团结和紧密合作而尽最大的努力。
    大使同志，我确信：在您为加强我们两国间的友谊关系和为我们的争取和平与民主的共同斗争而完成您所负的高尚使命中，您将得到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府、最高人民会议常任委员会及我个人的全力协助。
