　　On the eve of the Spring Festival, the herdsmen settled on the Ulanhada Grassland were particularly happy. On the newly papered windows of every household, colorful paper-cuts made by the girls were pasted. Spring couplets were also pasted on both sides of the doors and on the sheep and cattle pens. In the homes of the herdsmen, portraits of Chairman Mao and many New Year pictures were posted. Children in new clothes jumped happily around the yurts and houses. At night, the herdsmen lit bright lights in the cattle and sheep pens to celebrate the greater prosperity of livestock in the coming year. Firecrackers rang out everywhere in the pastoral villages, and the herdsmen's "family parties" began. Lao Hu, an old herdsman who had worked as a herder for more than forty years, held a party at his home. This herdsman, who didn't even have a single animal in the old society, was given fifteen sheep by the people's government in 1953, and now he has forty sheep and three cows. After the Jining-Erlian railway was built in his hometown, he sold the sheep manure, which was worthless in the past, to the cooperative as fertilizer. This year's Spring Festival was even richer than in previous years. He bought wine, pastries, and candy to entertain guests. The Namusilai family's party was also happier than in previous years. Relatives and friends from afar came by train to participate. They brought many New Year's gifts, including bananas, oranges, and new Mongolian song records. They drank wine and listened to the phonograph playing songs. On the day of the Spring Festival, the herdsmen got up early, and the quiet grassland was awakened by the loud sound of firecrackers. The male and female herdsmen were all dressed in their finest attire. The herdsman Xiala and his wife led their children to salute the portrait of Chairman Mao. They deeply appreciated the happy life that the Communist Party had brought to the herdsmen on the grassland.

    乌兰哈达草原上的春节
    春节前夕，定居在乌兰哈达草原上的牧民们格外欢乐。家家户户新糊的窗纸上，贴上了姑娘们剪的彩花。房门的两旁，牛羊圈上也贴起春联。牧民们家里，张贴着毛主席的像和许多年画。穿着新衣的孩子们在蒙古包和房子周围欢乐地跳跃。夜晚，牧民们在牛羊圈棚里点起明亮的灯火，祝贺来年的牲畜更加盛旺。牧村里四处响起鞭炮声，牧民们的“家庭晚会”开始了。曾经当过四十多年牧工的老牧民劳湖家里举行了晚会。这个在旧社会连一头牲畜也没有的牧人，一九五三年由人民政府救济了十五只羊，到现在他已有了四十只羊和三条牛。集宁二连铁路修到他的家乡后，他把过去不值钱的羊粪卖给合作社当肥料，今年春节就比往年过得更加丰富了。他买了酒、点心和糖来招待客人。牧民那木斯赉一家的晚会也比往年快乐。远处的亲戚朋友们坐火车赶来参加了。他们带来许多年节礼物，有香蕉、橘子，还有新的蒙古歌曲唱片。他们一面饮酒，一面听留声机放送歌曲。春节这天，牧人们一早就起来了，寂静的草原被响亮的鞭炮声惊醒。男男女女的牧民都穿戴起盛装。牧民夏拉和他妻子牵着小孩子向毛主席像行礼。他们深深感激共产党给草原上牧民们带来幸福生活。
