The First Automobile Works is making rapid progress in its winter construction project. Concrete pouring work is actively underway at the foundry workshop, the body pressing workshop, and the chassis workshop.

Currently, workers are braving sub-zero temperatures to strive for the early completion of the factory construction task.

Machine maintenance is crucial during winter construction. Here, workers at the mechanized supply station are oiling an excavator.

    第一汽车制造厂进行冬季施工
    第一汽车制造厂冬季施工工程进展迅速。铸工场、车身压制工场和底盘工场的浇灌混凝土工程正在积极进行。
    现在，工人们正在冒着摄氏零下十几度的严寒，为争取提前完成建厂任务而努力。
    冬季施工中的机器保养工作非常重要。这是机械化供应站的工人正在给掘土机注油。
