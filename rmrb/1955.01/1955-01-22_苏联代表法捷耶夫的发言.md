Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, January 21st: According to TASS, Soviet representative Fadeyev spoke on the 19th at an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council.

    Fadeyev emphasized that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council's decision to use atomic weapons shows that Western countries have embarked on the road to preparing for atomic war.

    After making such a risky and inhumane decision, the actions of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries necessitate that we (friends of peace) tell peace-loving people all over the world: the activities of the enemies of peace have entered a new and more dangerous stage. The danger of nuclear war threatens every country. The people of all countries must be fully aware of this situation. They can and must stop the preparation for atomic war, and they have the necessary strength to do so.

    While describing the peaceful nature of Soviet foreign policy, Fadeyev also pointed out that the peaceful nature of Soviet foreign policy is by no means a sign of weakness. The Soviet Union opposes atomic and hydrogen weapons primarily because it considers these weapons to be the most heinous and inhumane of all types of weapons of mass destruction, and because it wants to do everything possible to prevent its people and the people of other countries from becoming victims of the use of these weapons. When the American aggressors began to use atomic bombs for blackmail, the Soviet Union did not yet have such weapons. We were forced to arm ourselves with such weapons in order to defend our country from the adventurous actions of those who had completely lost their humanity. However, the Soviet Union has always consistently advocated the prohibition of atomic weapons, advocated the establishment of strict international supervision for the implementation of this ban, and advocated the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. The Soviet Union also advocated the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bomb tests, and advocated the simultaneous destruction of stockpiles of these bombs by all countries.

    Fadeyev concluded by saying: The peace-loving people of all countries will resolutely oppose the preparation for atomic war and the propaganda about atomic war, and they will make it impossible for the government of any country to launch an atomic war. We, the Soviet people, will do our utmost to support the world movement of the people of all countries against the atomic threat until final and complete victory is achieved.

    苏联代表法捷耶夫的发言
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社维也纳讯：苏联代表法捷耶夫十九日在世界和平理事会常务委员会扩大会议上发言。
    法捷耶夫强调说，北大西洋集团理事会的使用原子武器的决定表明，西方国家已经走上准备原子战争的道路。
    在作出这种冒险的和不人道的决定以后，北大西洋公约国家的所作所为都使我们（和平的友人）有必要向全世界爱好和平的人民说：和平的敌人的活动已经进入一个新的、更危险的阶段。核子战争的危险威胁着每一个国家。各国人民必须充分知道这种情况。他们能够并且必须制止原子战争的准备，并且他们具有这样作所必需的力量。
    法捷耶夫在叙述苏联外交政策的和平性质的时候同时指出，苏联外交政策的和平性质决不是软弱的表现。苏联所以起来反对原子武器和氢武器，首先是由于它认为这些武器是一切类型的大规模毁灭性武器中最罪恶的和最不人道的武器，是由于要竭力使它的人民和其他国家的人民不致成为使用这种武器所造成的受害者。当美国侵略分子开始用原子弹进行讹诈的时候，苏联还没有这种武器。我们被迫用这种武器使我们自己武装起来，以便保卫我们的国家，使它不致遭受那些完全丧失人性的人们的冒险行动的打击。但是，苏联在任何时期都始终坚持不渝地主张禁止原子武器，主张就实施这项禁令建立严格的国际监督，并主张把原子能用于和平目的。苏联也主张禁止原子弹和氢弹的试验，并且主张所有的国家同时销毁这些炸弹的储存。
    法捷耶夫最后说：一切国家的爱好和平的人民将坚决反对准备原子战争和关于原子战争的宣传，并且他们将使任何一国的政府不可能发动原子战争。我们苏联人民将尽全力支持各国人民反对原子威胁的世界运动，直到取得最后完全的胜利为止。
