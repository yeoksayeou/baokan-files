Since five days before New Year's Day, the Dabie Mountains in Anhui Province have experienced a second heavy snowfall. The Meishan Reservoir construction site is covered with more than a foot of snow, and the temperature has dropped to minus six degrees Celsius. The people building the reservoir are still persevering in their work in the snow-covered valley. On the construction site, the heavy snow obscures the roads, and sweat and snow form ice beads on people's heads. The workers are hammering away at the ice, leveling the roads, and clearing sand and gravel. The cofferdam of the No. 3 drainage station broke, and the workers, without even taking off their shoes, jumped into the icy water to reinforce the breach. In order to excavate the stone troughs for the continuous arch dam, workers from the Mechanical Construction Team dragged the mountain-opening machines and drill rods from the snow-covered mountain 100 meters away. Among them, the workers of the second group of the third team drilled nineteen blasting holes in six hours. Peasants Li Longheng and Li Baotang, who were clearing pebbles and excavating the drainage ditch, had their hair and beards covered with ice beads, but they said: We must build the dam before we go back, and they continued to carry pebbles and transport them outside the cofferdam.

Now, the first phase of the reservoir project, the task of clearing 265,000 cubic meters of sand and gravel, is nearing completion, and solid rock formations have appeared on the foundation of the continuous arch dam. After excavating the stone troughs, the first cubic meter of concrete for the continuous arch dam can be poured in mid-January.

    梅山水库冒雪施工
    从元旦前五天开始，安徽省大别山区下起第二场大雪，梅山水库工地积雪一尺多厚，气温降到摄氏零下六度。建设水库的人们，仍然在白雪皑皑的山谷中坚持工作。在工地现场上，大雪遮没了道路，汗水和雪水在人们头上结成了冰珠。工人们敲打着冰块，铲平道路，清理砂石。三号排水站的围坝破了，工人们连鞋子都顾不得脱，跳到冰冷的水中抢堵露口。为了开挖连拱坝的石槽，机筑队工人从一百多公尺的雪山上拖来了开山机和钻杆。其中三中队第二组的工人，在六小时内就打好了十九个爆炸筒。清理卵石和开挖龙沟的民工李龙横、李宝堂，头发上胡子上结满了冰珠，但他们表示：一定要把坝修好了再回去，仍然不停地抬着卵石，往围坝外运送。
    现在水库工程第一期清理二十六万五千公方砂石的任务已接近完成，连拱坝坝身基础上已出现了坚固的岩层。等开挖石槽后，一月中旬即可浇筑连拱坝第一方混凝土。
