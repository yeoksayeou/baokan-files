　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 3rd: According to a report from Mexico City by a correspondent for the American "Daily Worker", resistance to the reactionary rule of Castillo Armas within Guatemala is growing. Even members of the Guatemalan bourgeoisie who supported Armas and hoped he would secure favorable contracts with American companies are now expressing fierce dissatisfaction with the dire state of the Guatemalan economy. This discontent has been sharply intensified by the implementation of a special tax that exempts only the American United Fruit Company.
　　The "Daily Worker" correspondent points out that although the upper echelons of the Guatemalan army surrendered to the interventionists and American mercenaries, armed conflicts between the lower ranks of the Guatemalan regular army and Armas' mercenary bandits are still occurring frequently.
　　Within Guatemala, an organized resistance movement is expanding, called the "Democratic Restoration" movement. Participants in this movement are distributing leaflets and organizing people from all walks of life to wage a struggle against Armas' reactionary dictatorship.

    危地马拉人民反抗独裁统治的斗争扩大
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社纽约一日讯：美国“工人日报”记者从墨西哥城报道，危地马拉国内对卡斯蒂略·阿马斯反动统治的反抗正在增长。甚至支持阿马斯、指望他能同美国公司订些有利的合同的危地马拉资产阶级人士，现在对危地马拉经济的悲惨情况也表示激烈的不满。由于实施只有美国联合果品公司一家免税的特别税，这种不满情绪更急剧加深了。
    “工人日报”记者指出，虽然危地马拉军队的上层分子向干涉者和美国雇佣军投降了，然而危地马拉常备军的下级官兵和阿马斯的雇佣匪帮之间的武装冲突还在经常发生。
    在危地马拉国内，有组织的反抗运动正在扩大，这个运动叫做“民主复兴”运动。参加这个运动的人们在散发传单，组织各阶层居民进行反对阿马斯反动独裁的斗争。
