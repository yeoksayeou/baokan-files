Comrades!

It has been a long time since we held a nationwide meeting of construction workers, and it is very necessary to hold this meeting. I think this meeting will be beneficial not only to construction projects but also to various aspects of work in our industrial departments and other sectors of the national economy.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people have achieved great successes in the industrialization of our country. The working class, collective farmers, and intellectuals of the Soviet Union are all proud of these achievements, and our foreign friends are also delighted by them.

The industrialization of the Soviet state was achieved because our Party steadfastly implemented the directives of Lenin and Stalin. Industrialization has been and will continue to be our primary task. We must continue to strive to develop heavy industry. Heavy industry is the foundation of the national economy, the source of the economic and defense strength of a socialist state, and the root of the prosperity and cultural life of the working people. Only by further developing heavy industry can we smoothly advance all sectors of the national economy, continuously improve the welfare of the people, and ensure that the borders of the Soviet Union are not violated.

This is the main point. Further developing heavy industry—expanding the production of metals, coal, oil, electricity, chemical products, heavy machinery, machine tools, and forging and stamping equipment—is the powerful foundation for improving the productivity of agriculture and industry.

In the achievements of developing heavy industry, the Party and the government also attach great importance to the production of goods necessary for people's lives.

This year, we have done a lot of work to implement the resolution of the Plenum of the Central Committee of the Party on further developing agriculture. Everyone knows that the Communist Party regards increasing the yield of crops in all regions of the country and reclaiming wasteland to increase grain production as one of the most important tasks.

1954 was the first year of the struggle to realize the rapid increase in agricultural production. Everyone knows that this year, the climate conditions in Ukraine, the Volga region, and other southern regions were very poor. In these regions, due to drought, our grain yield was very poor. However, Siberia, especially the Altai Territory and Kazakhstan, provided great support to the motherland this year. The collective farmers, tractor station workers, state farm workers, and Party organization members of the Altai Territory, Siberian region, and Kazakh Republic all worked very well and did a lot for the country. Despite the poor harvest in the southern regions, by December 5 of this year, the national grain production increased by 271 million poods compared to the same period last year.

From the summary of the agricultural year published by the Central Committee of the Party and the Council of Ministers of the USSR on November 8 in the newspapers, everyone knows these figures. According to these figures, everyone knows that in 1954, we purchased more grain, meat, milk, vegetables, and other agricultural products than last year. Indeed, we purchased much more. Some people ask a question: despite the increase in the total amount of procurement and purchase of agricultural products this year, why is it sometimes not possible to buy the things needed in the stores? Why is this? This is because the demand for necessities has increased greatly, because people have more money. The price of goods has been reduced by tens of billions of rubles, and the real wages of workers and employees and the income of collective farmers have increased greatly.

It is precisely because of this that no matter how much we increase the production of goods, we cannot fully meet the people's demands. Whenever I talk to people in various places in our country and collective farmers, I often hear them asking for more sugar, leather shoes, and woolen goods, and of course, the quality must be excellent. The continuous increase in the demand for the quality of goods is the result of the measures taken by the Party and the government to create conditions for improving the purchasing power of the working people. Our task is to more fully meet the people's ever-increasing demands. Therefore, in the future, we must more systematically and resolutely struggle to further increase the production of grain, potatoes, vegetables, meat, textiles, and other goods.

In expanding grain production, we have laid a good foundation. In 1954, it was planned to reclaim 13 million hectares of wasteland, but in fact, 17.43 million hectares were reclaimed. The great achievements in reclaiming wasteland are the result of the selfless labor of the collective farmers, tractor station workers, state farm workers, and the working class of our country. The whole people have already realized the necessity of completing this task.

It can be confidently said that in 1955, due to the reclamation of wasteland, the sown area will not be less than 20 million hectares.

While increasing grain production, we have also created conditions for further improving all sectors of agriculture. This is especially necessary for the development of animal husbandry. We mainly need feed grain because our food is already sufficient. With the increase in the production of feed grain, collective farms and state farms will produce more meat, milk, butter, eggs, and wool. We need more grain to have a large reserve of grain in our country and also to use grain to develop trade with other countries.

The measures taken by the Party and the government in developing industry and agriculture are to further consolidate the power of the Soviet state and to continuously improve the welfare of our people. In this cause, the workers in the construction industry, which is developing year by year—our construction workers, construction material industry workers, builders of construction machinery that supplies technology to the construction sites, architects, structural engineers, and our vast construction army—play a very important role. This is the reason why the Central Committee of the Party and the Council of Ministers of the USSR decided to hold this meeting. This meeting is to discuss with everyone the important issues in construction, expose the existing shortcomings, and formulate specific measures to fundamentally improve the construction industry.

Urgent Issues in Construction Industrialization

Comrades! Our country is currently carrying out large-scale construction. To illustrate the scale of the work, we should mention that the Soviet state has invested more than 90 billion rubles in basic construction in the national economy since the post-war period. In this period, more than 8,000 large state-owned industrial enterprises have been restored and newly built and have all been put into production. Every year, we are expanding the construction of schools, hospitals, and residential buildings. In the post-war period, more than 2 billion square meters of residential buildings have been built for workers and employees in cities and worker settlements; and 4.5 million houses have been built for collective farmers and agricultural intellectuals in rural areas.

This year, the volume of construction and installation work nationwide is more than one and a half times that of 1946. In 1954 alone, the investment in basic construction was equivalent to the total investment in the same purpose during the Second Five-Year Plan.

As the foundation of our economic foundation—the construction of heavy industry enterprises—has taken a new big step forward. In the future, our focus should be on building new coal, oil, metallurgy, machinery manufacturing industries, new hydroelectric power stations, and other industrial enterprises. At the same time, large-scale residential construction will be carried out nationwide. This year, more than 30 million square meters of residential buildings will be completed in cities and worker settlements, and 400,000 houses will be built in rural areas, which is enough to illustrate this.

To smoothly complete the construction tasks before us, we must vigorously develop and improve our construction industry and resolutely eliminate the handicraft methods in all construction industry organizations.

Now we have the necessary conditions for the extensive industrialization of construction engineering. What are these conditions? First, we have already trained a large number of skilled worker cadres and experts. In the construction organizations and construction material industry departments of our country, there are tens of thousands of skilled workers and production innovators in various fields working. We now have many factories that can supply modern technical equipment to construction workers, which can reduce their labor and improve their labor productivity. We have established and are expanding construction bases to produce various assembled reinforced concrete structures, components, and building materials to meet the needs of construction projects.

From this meeting, we can see that there are certain achievements in our construction industry, but at the same time, there are many shortcomings. We must thoroughly expose these shortcomings and mobilize all forces to eliminate these shortcomings. Exposing shortcomings requires courage and sharpness, finding specific persons responsible for errors, because shortcomings are not produced by themselves, but are caused by certain workers. Criticism should not be unfocused, but should be directed at those who make mistakes or are responsible for shortcomings, as well as those who see shortcomings, tolerate them, and do not correct them.

Further implementing construction industrialization is the decisive condition for fundamentally improving the construction industry.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the USSR, in the resolution "On the Development of the Production of Assembled Reinforced Concrete Structures and Components in Construction," formulated a comprehensive plan to increase the production of reinforced concrete products. This will certainly ensure the transition of construction projects to the use of industrialized methods.

By widely expanding the production of assembled reinforced concrete structures and components, we will achieve great economic benefits. Construction workers know that not long ago, there was a debate on this issue, that is, in construction, should we take which path: using assembled structures or using monolithic concrete? Some people tried to drag construction workers towards the path of using monolithic concrete. We do not intend to mention the names of these people, nor do we blame them. I think these comrades have now realized that the views they insisted on in the past were wrong. Now it seems that everyone has clearly realized that we should take the more advanced path of using assembled reinforced concrete structures and components.

If monolithic concrete is used in construction projects, what will follow? This will inevitably cause chaos on the construction site, and we will have to use various different types and structures of formwork, waste more steel, cause cement to fly, and waste concrete and inert materials.

What will be the result of using assembled components? After using assembled reinforced concrete, it is possible to produce components like the machinery manufacturing industry; it is possible to make construction transition to factory methods.

Using assembled construction makes it possible for us to save money, save building materials, increase production, and thus also increase the wages of construction workers. For example, for single-story industrial workshops, if reinforced concrete structures are used to replace steel structures, the consumption of steel will be reduced by more than half; compared with monolithic concrete, the labor volume can be reduced by about two-thirds; and when applied to residential buildings, the demand for wood can be reduced by 20% to 25%. In addition, reinforced concrete structures are not easily corroded, are durable, and fire-resistant.

The resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the USSR has stipulated that 402 new factories and 200 open-air prefabrication sites will be built in the next three years to produce assembled reinforced concrete structures and components. In these three years, the production of assembled reinforced concrete will increase by four times, and therefore, the production of cement and inert materials will also increase by more than half.

When talking about the characteristics of using assembled reinforced concrete structures, some comrades will ask: "Which structure should be used? Should we focus on frame prefabricated panel structures or frameless large prefabricated panel structures?" I think we should not make any judgment on a certain structure at this time, but should develop in both directions. It is very possible that both directions can coexist after being proven by practice. Because we are building various different types of houses under various different conditions, practice will prove which of these two structures—frame prefabricated panel structures and large prefabricated panel structures—is more practical. They each have their advantages. At our meeting, both supporters and opponents of these two construction methods have spoken, but no one has proven that either method is unusable.

There is no doubt that while using reinforced concrete wall panels to build houses, we should also widely use large and small wall blocks to build houses.

The construction cost of large block buildings is 12% lower than that of brick buildings, but the degree of assembly is 38% to 85% higher. The use of large blocks in construction can greatly improve labor productivity: two masons can lay 3.5 cubic meters of brick walls in eight hours, while in the same time, two installers can install 25 cubic meters of large block walls.

We must promote the use of assembled reinforced concrete structures, components, and large blocks. Do not wait for the reinforced concrete factories to be built before promoting. Moreover, the production of wall blocks does not require special factories. On the construction site, electric heating or steam heating can be used to produce concrete blocks, which does not require complex equipment.

In the construction of houses, the installation of floor slabs is one of the main tasks. Structural engineers and construction workers have paid great attention to the problem of selecting the structure of prefabricated floor slabs.

Some comrades suggest that we only use the prefabricated multi-hole hollow slabs of Engineer Maklov. Because the production of these slabs is not complicated, we should organize this production as widely as possible. But in my opinion, prefabricated ribbed slabs have more advantages. They are very promising: because the production of these slabs can save materials, especially steel. This is very important; the sound insulation performance of prefabricated slab structures is good, and the cost of prefabricated ribbed slabs is much lower than that of other prefabricated slabs. We should strive to produce more machines to manufacture prefabricated ribbed slabs. However, in places where there are no factory conditions to produce prefabricated ribbed slabs, we should organize the production of prefabricated multi-hole hollow slabs reasonably. After widely using prefabricated slabs, we can drive the "handicraftsmen" who use monolithic concrete out of the construction site.

We should also mention the shortcomings in the construction of staircases. Now there are still many construction sites where the reinforced concrete staircases and stair landings obtained from the factory have not been well processed on the surface. Therefore, after the staircases and stair landings are installed, they have to be decorated on the construction site, and the same is true for wall panels and floor slabs, which is wrong. All processing work of reinforced concrete components should be completed in the factory. The back of the staircases delivered from the factory should be decorated and processed, and the steps should also be decorated. The stair landings should also have a processed back and be covered with tiles or terrazzo. To protect it from being damaged during construction, the surface should be covered with paper and then covered with wooden boards.

In the factory, the decoration work of wall panels and floor slabs must also be done well. The products delivered to the construction site should be complete and ready for installation. Otherwise, if we produce assembled components in the factory and install them on the eighth floor, and then consider how to go up to do these surface decorations and processing, then what is the advantage of prefabricated installation?

Concrete structures should be lightweight and not too heavy.

We must pay special attention to the use of thin, molded assembled structures, which have many advantages compared to heavy concrete structures. Their weight can be reduced by about 33%, the amount of cement used can be reduced by 20%, and the cost can be reduced by 15%.

In the factory, there are vibrators, vibrating tables, mechanical presses, and other machinery, which enable us to use dry-hard concrete instead of plastic concrete in the production of components and structures. The use of dry-hard concrete can quickly remove the mold and obtain high-strength products. The effect of using dry-hard concrete is to speed up the production by reducing the number of molds, to improve the quality of the products, to save steel used for making molds, and to reduce the cost of mold removal and installation. We should treat these issues with a sense of ownership, and only in places where there are no factories and cannot carry out the factory production of reinforced concrete products should we temporarily use plastic concrete.

By widely using assembled reinforced concrete products in construction, we can greatly reduce the use of wood and steel. Comrades, we must admit that we have not really learned to cherish and save such precious materials as wood and steel. In the future, we must not allow such waste.

Many people complain that there is no wood. Indeed, wood is not enough, but at the same time, the use of wood is still wasteful. Take the Ministry of Transport as an example, the sleepers of the railways are all made of wood, and the kilometer markers are all made of several meters long rails. The transmission towers, bridges, and culverts are all made of steel. Can all these not be replaced with reinforced concrete? For example, why can't we learn from the Czechs? They have made excellent reinforced concrete sleepers and saved wood. Go and see them, they are our friends and are very willing to share their experience with us.

I and Comrade Bulganin, Comrade Mikoyan, and other members of the delegation saw many reinforced concrete power poles and transmission towers when we visited China, and they were made very well. We should learn from this beneficial experience.

When we arrived in the Far East, we visited some factories, most of which used metal structures, and almost no assembled reinforced concrete was used. Why did this happen? Because some leading comrades allowed the frames of various workshops to be completely made of steel structures, and their reason was that this could speed up the completion. But this is not correct.

Comrades! We must resolutely eliminate the phenomenon of wasting steel. Only in places where steel must be used should steel be used to build houses, and in construction, all places where concrete or reinforced concrete can be used should be replaced with them.

When discussing the issue of construction industrialization, we cannot avoid talking about the development of building material production, because we need a large amount of building materials. I think the State Planning Commission and many comrades present today are responsible for this serious shortcoming. This shortcoming is that in developing the building materials industry, when we should use all our strength to develop the cement industry, we focus on building brick factories.

Brick is a major building material, and we have used and are using bricks in construction projects that are mainly carried out in handicraft methods. In this case, the weight of the wall material and the weight of the bricks are very important. Now that we have concrete, electric motors, cranes, and other mechanical equipment, we must not continue to use the old working methods. Everyone knows that making bricks takes a lot of time and labor. In the process of making bricks, first, clay must be obtained, mixed, made into brick blanks, dried, and then put into the kiln for roasting, and then put into the stack, and then transported to the construction site, moved to the scaffolding, and then built into walls. All these works have to be done repeatedly, and then like selecting mosaics, each brick has to be selected.

Isn't it better to use concrete blocks instead of bricks? These blocks are just the right size for the existing two-ton, three-ton, and five-ton cranes. Using blocks for construction can achieve very high labor productivity and a very high volume of work, and in the construction of other countries, concrete is widely used instead of bricks, which is not accidental.

At present, when the task of widely implementing industrialized construction has been put before us, we must vigorously develop the cement industry to ensure the large-scale increase in concrete production.

However, this does not mean that we no longer need to pay attention to the issue of improving the production of bricks using the existing capacity of brick factories.

The famous innovator Comrade Duvanov spoke at our meeting. He convincingly pointed out: the existing brick factories can increase the production of bricks by half or double. If the advanced brick-burning method proposed by Comrade Duvanov and already proven by the practice of many enterprises is adopted, such production can be fully achieved. Bricks will still be the main material for walling. Therefore, before concrete components replace bricks, we must vigorously improve the production of bricks.

In addition, we must carry out a series of work to strive for more reasonable use of bricks in construction. Here, Comrades Martsev and Shcherbakov talked about the method of rationally transporting bricks to the construction site. The use of brick baskets for transporting bricks is very beneficial to construction projects. However, we must continue to move forward, and in brick factories, bricks must be made into blocks to replace the use of brick baskets for transportation. For example, Czechoslovakia is already doing this, and everyone knows that Engineer Lebedkin has applied the initial experience in this regard to the Stalingrad project, and when making brick blocks, the decoration of the surface of the brick blocks should also be done in the factory. In this way, when using brick blocks to build walls, any additional processing work on the construction site can be saved.

Comrades! The smooth implementation of industrialized methods and the improvement of construction organizations to a large extent depend on the organizational and technical level of the leadership of construction projects.

With the strength of small construction organizations, it is impossible to achieve construction industrialization, improve construction speed, and reduce project costs. Therefore, construction organizations must be merged. At present, the Soviet Union has more than 7,500 construction contracting organizations, and one-third of the annual project volume of each does not exceed 5 million rubles. For example, in Leningrad, there are 133 construction organizations of a contracting nature, in Kiev, there are 107, and in Rostov, there are 56... and how many small construction organizations are there in various factories? They are countless. The number of construction organizations is not decreasing but increasing year by year.

If we continue to increase the number of construction organizations in the future, then we will not be able to truly raise the issue of construction industrialization. Everyone knows that small and therefore necessarily weak construction organizations have no strength to use industrialized construction methods. We must resolutely take the road of merging construction organizations, otherwise, we cannot talk about the issue of construction industrialization.

In this regard, the experience of merging construction organizations in Moscow can be used as a reference. On the basis of 56 construction companies belonging to the Moscow Soviet, various departments, and various agencies, a unified organization—the Moscow Residential and Civil Construction Bureau—was established. When discussing the establishment of the Moscow Residential and Civil Construction Bureau, there were many opinions. Some people said that the Moscow Soviet could not manage such a large organization, and some people were worried that if various departments were to disengage from this work, the construction plan for residential buildings might not be completed. Although it can be assumed that in the first year of the establishment of the Moscow Residential and Civil Construction Bureau, there may be some organizational shortcomings that affect the completion of the task, these concerns are groundless. Comrade Kuchinlin, the director of the Moscow Residential and Civil Construction Bureau, reported here on the results of merging construction organizations and told us that this year, the task of supplying 90 million square meters of living space to Moscow residents will be completed, and preparations for the 1955 construction projects will be made. The scale of the 1955 tasks is even greater than that of the previous year.

These facts show that the new organization has taken a big step forward. Because the preparatory work for construction projects is very important, I would even say it is the most important of the most important. Everyone knows that without normal preparatory work, it is difficult to make construction projects proceed smoothly. Without preparatory work, skilled workers cannot engage in their professional work but have to do earthwork and auxiliary projects. As a result, the labor productivity of workers will inevitably be reduced, the construction cost will be increased, and the project completion date will be delayed. On the contrary, doing the preparatory work well, giving full play to the skills of workers, can ensure that the work is carried out smoothly and uninterruptedly. Only large construction organizations have the strength to organize normal preparatory work.

In Leningrad, Kiev, and other cities, construction organizations should also be merged according to the example of Moscow. However, this work must be carefully and reasonably carried out. The establishment of powerful construction organizations is necessary because only in this way can large-scale use of reinforced concrete assembled structures and components be made in construction projects, only in this way can construction projects be fully mechanized, only in this way can labor productivity be improved, construction speed be accelerated, quality be improved, and project costs be reduced.

The experience of Moscow and other cities shows that specialized construction organizations must be established, and only specialized, not comprehensive, construction organizations can be established. Because only such organizations can use the industrialized methods of construction projects.

Specialized construction organizations can better organize workers' labor, improve workers' professional level, and make machinery play a higher role. For example, in Moscow, the "Foundation Construction" company was established to level the construction site, carry out earthwork, foundation work, and masonry of underground walls (using reinforced concrete components and blocks). In addition, there are such construction companies that only do general construction projects, such as installing walls (if the construction is built with large blocks or reinforced concrete prefabricated panels), installing staircases, floor slabs, and other projects, the installation of partition walls, and interior decoration are undertaken by specialized professional organizations. Sanitary engineering is also completed by specialized professional organizations. At the same time, there are specialized organizations that specialize in electrical engineering, elevator installation, and other projects.

The more detailed the division of labor, the higher the productivity, and the better the quality of the project. Only in this way can workers' wages be high. In places where there is no division of labor and all kinds of projects are completed by one company or project department, workers' wages cannot be high. Today, doing masonry, painting, and then tomorrow doing loading work, it is obvious that in such a situation, workers' wages will not be high.

The specialization of construction organizations can make the work more flexible, more mobile, faster, and more effective. Before starting the construction of factories and residential buildings, first, the leveling and leveling professional organizations level the site and lay the foundation, and lay various underground pipelines. At the same time, another professional organization should prepare to install the assembled structures of the building. In this way of organizing work, all projects can be carried out according to the project progress schedule. If the construction is a factory, the installation of the building structure can be carried out at the same time as the installation of machinery and equipment. Such organization of construction projects, we have had many examples in both wartime and post-war periods.

It is obvious that various specialized organizations cannot always stay in one place, and after completing their own work, they must move to another project. It should be said that the decision to establish regional specialized construction organizations is the most correct. However, not all places have the conditions to establish such organizations. Therefore, for the time being, only specialized organizations can be established under various departments.

We are currently carrying out large-scale construction of factories, residential buildings, schools, hospitals, and other buildings. These constructions are of great significance. We must urgently improve the speed, improve the quality, and reduce the cost. The only way to complete this task is to implement construction industrialization as widely as possible.

Eliminating Shortcomings in Design Work and Improving the Work of Architects

Comrades, the achievements of construction industrialization, the improvement of construction quality, and the reduction of project costs depend to a great extent on design organizations, on the work of architects and structural engineers.

Since our country is carrying out large-scale construction of factories, residential buildings, schools, hospitals, and cultural institutions, we cannot tolerate the backwardness of design work. Our country is under construction everywhere, and the Soviet government allocates tens of billions of rubles for construction every year. It can be said that everyone is very concerned about construction and hopes that it will go well. We cannot tolerate the phenomenon of delaying construction projects due to the slow work of design organizations, sometimes even delaying the construction of ordinary buildings for two years or more.

For the benefit of construction industrialization, it is necessary to reorganize the work of design organizations and make the compilation of standard designs and the use of existing standard designs the main work of design organizations.

The wide use of assembled reinforced concrete components, structures, large blocks, and new high-efficiency materials has become a new thing in construction technology, which unconditionally requires the abandonment of those outdated design methods.

However, many planning and design organizations do not fully understand the significance of standard designs.

The following facts can illustrate this. Among the 1,100 construction design organizations in the country, only 152 are partially engaged in standard designs. From 1951 to 1953, the funds used for standard design work accounted for less than 1% of the total funds used for all design work. In 1953, the industrial buildings constructed according to standard designs accounted for only 12% of the total industrial buildings, and the situation this year has not improved much.

I have talked with many engineers and architects about the design issue. They all agree that standard designs can greatly simplify and improve construction. However, in practice, many architects and structural engineers, and sometimes some process engineers in industrial construction, strive to create their own unique designs.

Why does this situation arise? Obviously, one of the reasons is that there are shortcomings in our work of cultivating architects. Many young architects, just out of school, have not yet stood firmly, and want to be like architectural masters who only want to design unique buildings, and want to build a "man-made" monument for themselves immediately. If Pushkin built a monument that workers could not build for himself, then many architects always want to build a "man-made" monument for themselves with their unique designs.

It must be understood that if we build all industrial buildings, residential buildings, and other buildings according to unique designs, then the construction speed will be greatly reduced and the construction cost will be increased.

Many design workers—architects and structural engineers—are indeed working creatively, and they have made many new and beneficial contributions in their work, but there are also many shortcomings in their work. Some design workers have not considered using the structures, components, and building materials produced by the factories of the construction industry in their designs, and to this day, they still take those backward construction methods as the starting point.

Take the construction of residential buildings as an example. Why not choose the best and most complete residential building designs and use them repeatedly in construction? Let architects compete to propose such residential building designs!

At present, it is especially necessary to choose excellent designs for large block residential buildings. In 1953, the design organization of the Moscow Soviet drafted a batch of residential building design schemes built with large blocks and large prefabricated panels. At that time, it was believed that the scheme proposed by Academician I. V. Zholtovsky of the Soviet Academy of Architecture was the best. At that time, it should have been designed according to this scheme and used it as a standard design to build some large block residential buildings in the next few years, but this was not done.

Why do we need to use 38 kinds of standard designs for schools now? Is this reasonable? Obviously, this is because many workers do not take an economic approach to the construction industry.

We should choose a limited number of standard designs for residential buildings, schools, hospitals, kindergartens, nurseries, stores, and other buildings. For example, in the next five years, first carry out large-scale construction according to these designs. After this period, discuss again, if there are no better designs, then extend the use period of these designs for another five years. Comrades! What is wrong with doing this!

What are the advantages of building according to standard designs? The advantages are numerous. For example, I want to build a house, and the design is already available. This construction needs how much land, which structures and materials, and how many workers, all these are very clear. With these conditions, we can speed up the construction and reduce the construction cost.

Take the design of industrial buildings and structures as an example. The design of industrial buildings and the standard design of residential buildings are the same, which are composed of standard units and standard spans that are used repeatedly. In each span, the columns, beams, crane beams, and other components are unchanged. When compiling the standard design of industrial buildings, it is necessary to consider the possibility of arranging various production workshops and auxiliary workshops of different industrial departments in the building. Buildings of different uses can be built with the same building components. Therefore, when drafting the standard design of industrial buildings, it is necessary to adopt a unified column grid and unified floor height, unified load, unified stairwells, windows, and doorways, etc.

The use of such standard designs makes it possible to organize the large-scale production of building components and structures in advance and to transition from general construction methods to assembled construction methods, so that the project can be completed in a short time. Comrades! We must do this.

To promote standard designs, we should have the determination and willpower, because we may encounter resistance in this matter. Of course, we should explain to some people the necessity of this work well.

Whether from the perspective of saving money or accelerating construction and improving construction quality, using standard designs in construction will achieve great results. This is undoubted.

Comrades! I want to talk to you about some of my thoughts and opinions on the work of architects. First, I want to mention Comrade Moldavinov, the director of the Academy of Architecture. I, Comrade Moldavinov, often meet due to work in Moscow. I know you are a good organizer; you have shown your organizational ability in the fast-flow construction of the large Kaluga Street. At that time, fast-flow construction was carried out for the first time, and it was carried out with the participation of Comrade Moldavinov. However, after the war, Comrade Moldavinov changed. He is no longer the Moldavinov of the past. As sung in the opera "The Tsar's Bride": I "no longer recognize Grigory Grigorievich!" (Laughter, applause)

In our construction, we often see the phenomenon of wasting money. In this regard, many architects are greatly responsible because they have caused waste in the architectural decoration of buildings built according to unique designs.

Such architects have become obstacles on the road of construction industrialization. To smoothly and quickly carry out construction, it is necessary to carry out construction according to standard designs, but obviously, this does not suit the taste of some architects.

Comrade Moldavinov's report at this conference and the speeches of some architects show that they have evaded the economic issues in construction and are not interested in the cost per square meter of living space.

Architects, like all construction workers, should immediately pay attention to the economic issues in construction, delve into this issue. It must always be remembered that one of the most important issues in construction is the cost of the buildings built, that is, the cost per square meter of area.

An architect, if he does not want to fall behind in life, should not only know and be able to use architectural forms, decorations, and various different decorative components, but should also know new, progressive building materials, reinforced concrete structures, and components. He should first be proficient in the economic issues of construction. It is precisely because of this issue that criticism was raised against Moldavinov and many of his colleagues at this conference. Because when they design a building, they forget the most important thing—forget the cost per square meter of area. They are intoxicated with those unnecessary facade decorations, causing a lot of waste.

Sometimes, on the facade of residential buildings, many unnecessary decorations are placed, which show that some architects lack taste. This makes construction workers sometimes even very difficult to complete these decoration tasks.

In this regard, the construction of high-rise buildings has a great influence. When designing high-rise buildings, architects mainly pay attention to the establishment of the three-dimensional outline of the building, and do not consider the construction cost and the cost of use of these buildings.

Just for decoration, special complex convex-concave walls are made, which will cause a lot of heat loss and greatly increase the maintenance cost. For example, the building on Smolensk Square wastes 250,000 rubles of fuel every year for this reason. Just this one building.

I want to provide some data on the distribution of the construction area of high-rise buildings.

Near the Red Gate High-rise Building	Smolensk Square High-rise Building

Total construction area	100	100

Area occupied by main rooms	28.1	30

Area occupied by auxiliary rooms	23.1	24

Area occupied by engineering equipment and service rooms	14.9	2

Area occupied by structures	33.9	35

From the above data, it can be seen that in high-rise buildings, the main area is very small, while the so-called structural area occupies a lot. What is called structural area? This is the area occupied by walls and structures. In high-rise buildings, to create the outline, this area is greatly exceeded the quota. This area can only be used for viewing, and it is not possible to live and work in these areas. (The venue is lively, laughter, applause)

Some people may say that high-rise buildings are beautiful anyway, maybe the criticism of them is inappropriate? Our opinion is that it is best to severely criticize their shortcomings, because if we do not do this now, the situation of imitating high-rise buildings will become popular, and as a result, the so-called "structural area" will be increased too much. (Laughter, applause)

When Comrade Moldavinov spoke, I asked him about the cost of the high-rise building "Ukraine Hotel" being built according to his design. It should be said that Comrade Moldavinov is not behind those who cause waste in architectural decoration, but is on par with them. In the "Ukraine Hotel," the cost per square meter of the main area is equal to 175% of the cost per square meter of the "Moscow Hotel."

In the same city of Moscow, the cost per square meter of living area of residential buildings built according to different authors' designs differs by 600 to 800 rubles. Can this be tolerated?

In Moscow, the external decoration cost of many residential buildings accounts for 15% to 20% of the total construction cost, and some even reach 30%, while the quota is 8% to 9%. This phenomenon is also intolerable.

Comrades! On some basic issues—we must build comfortable and convenient residential buildings, there is no disagreement between us and the architects, this is an important issue, this is an issue about the convenience of a person's life. On the issues of the number of small and large apartments, their size, and the height of rooms, generally speaking, there is no disagreement. However, once the issue involves the artistic decoration of the building facade, disagreements often arise. The issue of artistic decoration of buildings is the most complex issue.

Some architects are keen on building spires on buildings, making these buildings look like churches. Do you like the three-dimensional outline of churches? I do not want to argue about personal interests, but for residential buildings, such an appearance is unnecessary. We should not turn the artistic form of modern residential buildings into the same as churches or museums. This will not make the residents feel any convenience and comfort, but will only make the building inconvenient to use and increase its cost. However, some architects do not consider this issue.

For example, in the design, Architect Zakharchov proposed to build a building on the Moscow Tula Street with a three-dimensional outline that is not much different from a church. At that time, everyone asked him to explain and explain the basis for this. He said: "To make our design match the high-rise buildings, we must show the three-dimensional outline of these buildings." It is obvious that Comrade Zakharchov is most interested in these issues. He needs beautiful contour lines, but people need houses, they do not appreciate these three-dimensional outlines, but need houses to live in! (Applause) In the design of the building on Lusinovsky Street, the architect wanted to place statues on the corners of the building from the eighth floor. The corners of the building with windows on five sides are very inconvenient to live in; as for the people living in this room who have to see the back of the statue all year round, it is even more needless to say. Obviously, living in such a room will not be particularly comfortable. Fortunately, such a building was not built, and everyone stopped Comrade Zakharchov from using such artistic means.

These things are called the architectural art form of houses! No, comrades, this is a distortion of architectural art, they are only wasting materials and money. The decision of the Moscow organization to remove Comrade Zakharchov from the leadership of the architectural art workshop is correct. However, for the sake of work, this measure should have been taken earlier.

In early 1955, two large reinforced concrete product factories were opened in Moscow, and products have already been produced, but we now only have one approved design for frame prefabricated panel houses. Who obstructed the design work? Many architects are responsible, but the first person to be responsible is Comrade Frasov—Moscow's chief architect. He is a good architect, but sometimes he is not decisive enough.

We must vigorously support and encourage good design work, especially standard design work. We should consider whether to modify the salary system of design workers. A salary system that can better stimulate the work of designers should be established. (Applause)

The serious shortcomings in the work of design organizations and some architects are largely due to the incorrect guidelines proposed by the Academy of Architecture and many leading architects. Until recently, such guidelines were proposed:

In the first issue of the "Architecture Art" collection published in 1945, the director of the Academy of Architecture—Moldavinov published an article titled "The Art Issues of Soviet Architecture." It said: "Architectural art serves to satisfy the people's demand for beauty... To create great architectural works, it is necessary to build some architectural volumes that are not constrained by practical needs (columned gates, grand halls, high towers)... I think that every city, if it wants to become a beautiful city, cannot do without a high-rise composition."

In the same collection, Professor Bunin's article "On the Issue of Using Urban Construction Heritage in Post-War Restoration" was also published, which said:

"To beautify the city, some buildings without functional basis are needed, especially dome buildings and high towers... Soviet cities are now suffering from a vertical line crisis—city centers and public buildings, high towers and dome buildings should be handled separately, and no standardization is needed."

Such opinions are countless.

The leaders of the architectural field often emphasize artistic issues and rarely talk about the economic and comfortable issues of residential buildings and other buildings. Obviously, we must fight against the phenomenon of architectural art separating from the important issues of construction.

Some architects try to use the necessity of fighting against structuralism to justify their incorrect guidelines and waste in design. However, under the banner of fighting against structuralism, the national funds are wasted.

What is structuralism? As pointed out by the Great Soviet Encyclopedia: "Structuralism, with 'structural expression' (therefore called structuralism), replaces artistic creation with simple technicism. Structuralists advocate 'functional' and 'rational' requirements of 'suitability' and 'appropriateness,' but in fact, they lead to the appreciation of formal beauty that is separated from content... As a result, the anti-artistic and decadent 'box style' that is the characteristic of the latest bourgeois architectural art appears. The expression of structuralism has been severely criticized in many Party directives and resolutions... (Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 1953, Volume 22, Page 437).

This definition is of course not exhaustive. However, from the above-mentioned characteristics of structuralism, it can be seen that some architects are helpless, and these architects use the rhetoric of fighting against structuralism to cover themselves, but in fact, they are catering to the facade, that is, catering to the form, sacrificing the internal planning and convenience of use of the house, and ignoring the urgent needs of the people.

Individual architects who advocate fighting against structuralism have gone to the other extreme—using excessive, sometimes completely unnecessary, and only wasteful national funds to decorate the facade of the house with decorations.

A house without spires, upper-level annexes, and colonnades, or a house whose facade is not decorated with false decorations, is called a box and is determined to be a recurrence of structuralism. Perhaps we can call these architects structuralists, because they themselves roll towards "the appreciation of formal beauty that is separated from content."

Many architects, under the guise of fighting against structuralism and socialist realism in architecture, casually waste the wealth of the people, and this phenomenon can no longer be tolerated.

The fight against structuralism should be carried out with reasonable means. We should not be infatuated with architectural decoration, artistic decoration, building towers without foundation on houses, or placing statues, we do not oppose beauty, but we oppose extravagance and waste. The facade of the house should have a beautiful and attractive appearance, which depends on the overall building, the windows and doors have good proportions, the balconies are arranged cleverly, the characteristics and colors of the facing materials are correctly used, and in the construction of large blocks and large prefabricated panels, the components and structures of the walls are truly displayed.

When compiling each design, it is necessary to consider saving the consumption of construction funds. The house should be solid, and the cost of use is also economical. Architects should learn to cherish the money of the people, this is a very important issue. My words will touch the pain points of architects. I am speaking precisely for this reason, and a few words will not solve the problem. Everyone talks about friendship, harmony, and in this situation, the money of the people is being wasted—this is not a good and principled friendship, we should talk about friendship with those who strengthen the power of the socialist state, we should support those who work for the interests of the people.

Title: Speech by Comrade Khrushchev at the All-Union Conference on Construction Questions
Author:
Date: 1954-12-28
Page: 1

Comrades! It should be said that among architects, including those in the Academy of Architecture, there are many comrades who actively oppose certain incorrect policies of some architects. However, their objections have not been given due attention. You, Comrade Moldavianov, and your close associates have suppressed the voices calling for the elimination of excessive decoration and false ornamentation in architecture. (Applause)

At this conference, everyone listened with great interest to the rich content of the speech by Comrade Gradov, the architect. When speaking about the tasks of Soviet architecture, Comrade Gradov and other comrades correctly pointed out the necessity of overcoming formalist distortions and conservative habits in architecture. They spoke about the necessity of critically using classical heritage, about the fact that architecture should serve the urgent needs of our society, and for this, it is necessary to more closely link architecture with modern technology and construction in all its aspects, to widely develop creative initiatives and innovations in architecture, and to eliminate any monopolism and suppression of criticism. We cannot but agree with these conclusions and suggestions.

During the preparatory period for this conference, Comrade Gradov wrote a letter to the Party Central Committee, in which he expressed his critical views on architectural issues. How did Comrade Moldavianov respond to this criticism? He took all possible measures in advance to prevent Comrade Gradov from speaking at this conference. This fact proves that in the Academy of Architecture, there is no environment for free exchange of views on creative issues and for the development of criticism.

It must also be noted that the State Construction Committee does not strongly lead the work of the Academy of Architecture, pays little attention to the situation with standard designs, and pays little attention to the situation with urban planning and construction work.

Unfortunately, some architects still have incorrect views on design and extravagant waste in the artistic shaping of residential buildings.

Regarding this, I would like to talk about the impressions we gained after visiting the city of Sverdlovsk. Sverdlovsk is a very good large city, where you can see the strength of the Soviet Union. There are large factories producing excellent machines. However, in the urban construction and welfare facilities of this large center, there are many chaotic phenomena, for example, when reconstructing the building of the city executive committee, a tower and a spire were built on the facade. Just the construction of a spire cost almost two million rubles, and the reconstruction of the entire building cost nine million rubles. Probably, most of these expenses were spent on making the facade of the building suitable for the upper part of the building and on the construction of the tower. Just the funds spent on the construction of the spire could build two schools, each accommodating four hundred students.

On one street in Sverdlovsk, there is a five-story large building.

"This is a flour mill," explained Comrade Kutylev, the regional party secretary, and immediately added, "but we want to build a new flour mill, and this building is planned to be reconstructed into a hotel."

"How to reconstruct?" we asked him.

"Like this," Comrade Kutylev affirmed, "we want to turn the flour mill into a hotel."

"Why turn the flour mill into a hotel," we told him. "Wouldn't it be better to build a new one?"

Please judge for yourselves. Is it reasonable to turn a building used for a flour mill into a hotel and then build a new flour mill? (Laughter in the hall. Applause) After all, with these funds, you can build a good new hotel, and this will be better and cheaper. Where did common sense go? Where did economic rationality go?

We continued to walk around the city of Sverdlovsk. The regional party secretary said:

"We also want to improve this road."

"How do you plan to do it?"

"Cover it with asphalt."

And the road surface is paved with granite blocks. After all, such a road surface can last until the time of our grandchildren, while the asphalt road will not last more than ten years. Why destroy the granite road surface?

When we reached the building of the regional party committee, the regional party secretary said:

"This is our regional party committee building, we want to reconstruct it."

"How to reconstruct? For what purpose?"

"We don't like the facade, it should be completely renovated."

What does reconstruction mean? How much will it cost to renovate a six-story building? Obviously, it is cheaper to build a new building than to renovate an old one.

Hearing these suggestions, you are reminded of the immortal Shevchenko, who once mocked a governor who demolished everything built by his predecessor. Apparently, in some places, these habits, ridiculed by the great Russian satirist Shevchenko, still exist! (Applause)

This harmful passion for reconstruction will cost the state a lot of money. Only those who have lost a sense of responsibility for the cause entrusted to them can do this. Comrade Bulganin, Comrade Mikoyan, and I warned the leaders of Sverdlovsk that if they continue to do this and carry out unnecessary reconstructions, they will be punished.

There are also many wasteful phenomena in the construction of medical and cultural facilities. In 1953, a sanatorium for the Ministry of Shipbuilding was built in Sochi. The employees of this ministry and the chairman of the Sochi City Soviet felt that the facade was too plain and suggested renovating the already completed facade. For this purpose, 800,000 rubles were spent. With these funds, you could build a residential building accommodating twenty families (each with two rooms).

We have reason to believe that such wasteful phenomena and various expensive reconstruction projects in many cases are carried out according to the advice of architects. After all, if we analyze it from the essence, then the Directorate of Construction Affairs of the Council of Ministers of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic also follows this line in its work. In 1953, this directorate held a competition for the best buildings completed in the cities and workers' settlements of the Russian Federation. Which buildings won the prizes?

In the workers' settlement of Vatutinka in the Moscow region, a kindergarten was built. Due to the expansion of various dimensions, the volume of the building per place was 91.9 cubic meters, while the norm is 24 cubic meters. The building is filled with various sculptural decorations. The external architecture has a "palatial" character. The funds spent on this building could build three kindergartens. And the author of this design received the first prize. For what? For wasting funds. (Laughter)

In the city of Ufa, a cinema was built according to a standard design. The facade of the building was redesigned, and many expensive decorations were used. The cost of the decoration work accounts for more than 30% of the total cost. The author of the design also received the first prize.

In the sixth sanatorium building of the Yalta city, the area processing exceeded the norm by more than half, and the author of the design received a prize.

All these facts indicate that the Directorate of Construction Affairs of the Council of Ministers of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic has pointed the architects in the wrong direction and does not care about the economic issues of construction.

You may ask, then who is the chairman of the jury of this competition? This position is held by Comrade Chernyshev, the secretary of the Union of Soviet Architects, formerly the chief architect of Moscow. It is regrettable that such an experienced architect has deviated from the correct path. Perhaps, it would be useful to revoke this incorrect jury decision. (Applause)

After this conference, it is necessary to hold meetings of architects, structural engineers, and production and construction workers in cities and departments, to let people speak openly and reach a common understanding. I believe that the majority of architects will correctly understand our requirements. (Applause) Those who do not understand should be corrected.

Here, Comrade Vishnevsky suggested approving the "factory price" based on the cost per square meter of living space and regulating the cost of residential construction by district and city. Perhaps this will help to overcome waste in design. I think this suggestion is correct.

It is necessary to eliminate serious shortcomings in urban planning and design. Our party organizations and Soviet bodies should constantly study this important work. One of the causes of the shortcomings in the work of architects is that in many cases they do not feel the supervision and assistance of local party and Soviet organizations. It is necessary to increase the responsibility of local bodies for the construction and welfare facilities of cities and villages.

Until recently, the design of Soviet city planning had to be approved by the Union government. In this case, the approval of the design would be delayed for a long time. In particular, one can cite such an example: after the war, Kiev compiled the design of the city center. This design was transported many times from Kiev to Moscow and back. The Kreshchatyk Street was almost completed, but the design was not approved. And this is not an isolated case. We believe it is necessary to grant more powers to local bodies and reconsider the procedure for approving city construction designs. (Applause) It must be taken into account that local cadres have grown, and under correct organizational work, they will be able to skillfully solve these problems. Such handling of the issue will increase the responsibility of local leaders and encourage their initiative.

On the other hand, it is obviously appropriate to demand that the State Construction Committee strengthen supervision over the work carried out locally, so that we no longer have such chaos as we saw in Sverdlovsk.

If we can seriously organize standard designs, decisively improve the work of architects and structural engineers, pay attention to economic issues, increase the responsibility of our local bodies, and more actively encourage their initiative, then we will certainly achieve new great successes in construction, in reducing construction costs and improving quality.

Improving quality is the most important task of construction workers.

Comrades! The issue of improving construction quality deserves special attention. We should not only build quickly but also build well and solidly. We should value the title of our construction workers. Houses should be convenient for living and convenient for use. Poorly built houses need to be repaired every short period of time, thus increasing the expenditure of funds. This applies to all types of construction.

First of all, I would like to talk about the quality of residential building construction. Are the walls and floors of the houses we build solid? I think they are very solid. In residential buildings, schools, hotels, and other buildings, the walls and floors are built to last a hundred years. This is indisputable because reinforced concrete is widely used in construction. However, it should be said directly that the decorative work of the houses is often done poorly. Not only that, but many workers also tolerate obviously careless and poor work in the decoration of the houses. Many comrades who spoke at the meeting were completely correct about this.

Not long ago, Comrade Bulganin, Comrade Mikoyan, and I visited many cities in the Far East, Siberia, and the Urals. We were well received. This is understandable: guests are demanding people, they may criticize, and even not just criticize. Therefore, they try to receive us well. (Laughter, applause) In Sverdlovsk, we lived in a hotel, which was built very solid and durable. One can imagine that they would not accommodate us in a bad room. (Laughter) However, even in this hotel, we saw that the bathrooms were built very poorly, and the quality of the decorative work was not high. We called the hotel manager and the city leaders and told them: Look, what poor work!

Obviously, there were no strict requirements during construction. The quality of the tiles was poor, and they were laid carelessly. The pipes in the bathrooms were rusty, probably, before our arrival, they hastily painted them with gray paint, and also painted the walls. The connections of these pipes were done very poorly, I used to be a fitter, so I was very angry: even before the revolution, in the mines, the connections of the pipes were done better and neater.

On Sakhalin Island, we lived in a military hotel. The building of the hotel was good, but the quality of the decoration of the bathrooms and toilets was also very poor. The quality of the facing tiles was poor, and they were laid carelessly.

About such facts, and there are many such facts, it should be told to the construction workers, and it should be demanded that they decisively improve the quality of the work. The Minister of the Construction Materials Industry, Comrade Yudin, and other workers of the Construction Materials Industry should not be complacent, they should learn from our Czechoslovak friends, who have produced very good construction materials and fittings. (Applause) In this work, we can also learn from the German Democratic Republic, which produces high-quality facing tiles. It should be said directly that some comrades rarely learn from others, and mainly do not want to learn. (Applause)

In the residential buildings that have been handed over for use, many unfinished works are often left, causing inconvenience to the residents.

Special attention should be paid to improving the quality of woodwork. Many doors and windows in the rooms are made poorly. But you know, when a person enters a house, he first notices the door: how it closes; whether there are gaps; how the paint is; similarly, he will see how the windows are made, and how good the ironwork on the windows is. We should persistently and continuously struggle to improve the quality of decorative work. In residential buildings, the stairwells should also be well decorated.

Much work needs to be done to improve the sound insulation quality of residential buildings, especially to study the sound insulation between residents. This issue should be handled perfectly. The partition walls between residents and the floors between floors should meet the requirements of sound insulation.

There are many shortcomings in the floor laying work. Parquet is laid on mastic, but the quality of the mastic used is often unsatisfactory, it often seeps out from under the parquet. The parquet is also laid poorly, the quality of parquet laying should be improved.

The production of linoleum should be more widely developed. Floors covered with linoleum are not inferior to parquet, they are more hygienic, more elegant, and easier to maintain. Everyone knows that parquet needs to be waxed, this work is complicated and increases the cost. We should value the labor of women and try to reduce the labor of women as much as possible.

In many cases, the quality of kitchen furniture is also poor. This is not because we cannot do better, but because the requirements for quality are not strict: using wet wood, poorly painted, these shortcomings must be corrected. At the same time, the production of good furniture for schools, hospitals, and residences should be more widely expanded.

Ceramic facing tiles are the best materials for the exterior decoration of buildings. Ceramic facing materials are durable, beautiful, and do not change color during use. The half-dry pressing machine designed by Comrade Merlia attended this meeting and spoke about the work of the press, which has already produced different sizes and colors of ceramic products for us at a low cost. It is necessary to make architects familiar with these materials and work with Comrade Merlia to create new types of ceramic facing materials.

The task of improving the quality of work requires us to demand more strictly from the Ministry of Construction Materials Industry, the leaders of enterprises producing construction materials. With high-quality materials, conditions can be created to reduce construction costs and improve construction quality.

In cities, there is no effective supervision of construction, which in many cases leads to poor quality of work. Therefore, it is necessary to raise the issue of improving the work of the State Construction Supervision Agency. Various views have been expressed on this. Comrades proposed to grant the following rights to the workers of the State Construction Supervision Agency: stop the progress of work; severely punish the responsible persons for poor construction work; increase the sense of responsibility for the quality of work, etc. Obviously, these suggestions should be studied, and various measures should be taken to influence bad construction workers, strengthen supervision over construction workers, and increase the requirements for them, so that in the future, we can build solidly and well. I think we can do this.

Improving the quality of each construction project, whether it is industrial construction, residential building construction, or any other construction, is a matter of great national significance. Whether it is the construction workers themselves, from the leaders of various departments to each worker, or the party, Soviet, trade union, and Komsomol organizations in various places, should care about the high-quality construction of construction projects. Under such constant and public supervision, the quality of construction projects will be improved to the high level required by our people.

Regarding some issues of construction planning and economics

At the meeting, many speakers talked about serious shortcomings in construction planning work, about the dispersal of funds on many construction projects, delays in construction periods, and the inability to fully supply construction materials, which increases construction costs.

The dispersal of funds on many construction projects causes great losses. I would like to supplement the projects mentioned at the meeting with a few "bearded" projects. The Ministry of Transport has been building the Askiz-Abaza railway since 1940. The cost of the project is 74 million rubles. In thirteen years, 64% of the total funds were spent. In 1955, the plan is 5 million rubles. If construction is carried out according to such a construction plan, the construction of this line will continue for another nineteen years.

The Ministry of River Transport has been building a shipyard in Yaroslavl Oblast since 1949. The construction cost is approximately 50 million rubles, and in five years, about 10 million rubles have been spent. The 1955 construction plan is 3 million rubles. If construction is carried out at this speed, the total construction will take about twenty years. Can such slow construction and spending money without a sense of ownership be allowed? Comrades, we must eliminate these phenomena!

If these projects are needed, then we will complete them in a shorter period, and not drag the construction for several decades.

Please allow me to read a letter written by Comrades Sklyufkin and Nesterov, the leaders of the lamp factory under construction, and Comrade Brum, the head of the planning department of the 13th Construction Company, to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. They wrote as follows:

"The 13th Construction Company has been working on many large projects for many years. Each project costs tens of millions of rubles. Every year, including 1954, each project plans eleven to forty construction projects. In more than a hundred construction projects, work is carried out simultaneously, while the company has only nine hundred workers. On each construction project, there are ten to fifteen people on average. Some construction projects are very large production workshops, boiler houses, and residential buildings.

The reason for such dispersal is that the departments, as the contracting parties, did not consider the capabilities of the construction organization and included a large number of construction projects and funds in the annual plan.

There are approved lists of construction projects and guarantees of funding for those factories that insist on carrying out construction work on all construction projects. These requirements can be confirmed by the telegrams and orders of the departments. Therefore, the construction organization has to work on all construction projects simultaneously, alternately, sometimes rushing to build this factory, sometimes rushing to build that factory. Therefore, most of the construction projects planned cannot be completed and handed over for use, which delays the start of production of the factories.

Simultaneous construction of the same type of work on many construction projects will cause difficulties. Therefore, most of the factories that started construction in 1951, which could have been completed in two years, will take five to seven years to build. The funds spent on construction are idle capital. Due to the inability to hand over the production site in time, the equipment stored in the warehouse of the contracting party is not installed for several years, which makes a large amount of funds frozen as equipment reserves. The tension in the supply of materials has worsened the use of labor and machinery, and the quality of construction has decreased.

It is necessary to stop the planning work of simultaneously carrying out construction and installation work on many large factories. The State Planning Committee of the USSR must adhere to the principle of concentrating the allocated funds, not the principle of dispersing them to many construction projects, and allocate construction tasks in a planned manner according to the contracting departments and the construction departments."

The critical opinions and conclusions of the letter writers are completely correct. The shortcomings mentioned in the letter exist in many cities and departments. It is necessary to stop such phenomena of dispersing funds to various construction projects.

How to fight against these shortcomings? The fight against the dispersal of funds should first be carried out by the ministers and leaders of all supervisory bodies. The State Planning Committee of the USSR must also pay special attention to this matter. Perhaps, it is necessary to organize inspections and supervision without increasing personnel, entrusting workers to carry out supervision, who not only collect materials but also check how the funds allocated for construction projects are used; whether the lists of construction projects are correctly compiled; whether there are phenomena harmful to the state interests.

The main thing is to strictly adhere to the system: no design, no budget, no construction drawings, no start of construction. (Applause) But what is the actual situation? As soon as the decision to start construction is made, the "start of construction" report has already arrived, but actually, there are no design documents. Everyone knows that before starting construction, the site should be well leveled, roads should be built, water and power supply should be ensured, and there should be a complete design. Who should supervise the observance of this system? The State Planning Committee. But only the State Planning Committee is difficult, the ministers of the contracting departments and the construction departments should also do this work.

When planning construction projects, it is necessary to consider the production capacity, capabilities, and requirements of the construction organization and construction industry. Only with design documents can funds be allocated for basic construction. Various departments, supervisory bodies, and the State Planning Committee should improve the planning work of construction projects.

Some of our comrades working in the planning and supply departments sometimes forget this: even a small inaccuracy in their calculations can cause the state to lose millions of rubles.

We have suffered a lot in this regard, that is, the metal and other materials obtained by the construction site are not always the required varieties. I will give two examples, and construction workers can give countless similar examples. Construction workers need steel wire with a diameter of 5.5 millimeters in reinforced concrete. But there is no such wire, so they tell the construction workers: use the one that is 1 millimeter thicker, with a diameter of 6.5 millimeters. It seems that the difference is not much--only 1 millimeter, is it worth arguing over this? Therefore, in 1953, in some projects of the Ministry of Construction, this 1 millimeter alone cost an additional 4,800 tons of metal. This is already a large number, and it is completely correct for the State Planning Committee to fight against it. Comrades, this 1 millimeter is not cheap!

In the projects of the Main Directorate of Oil Pipeline Construction, the design specifies the use of thin-walled oil pipes. In fact, the pipes supplied by the industry are thick-walled. Therefore, in 1953, this directorate alone wasted 3,400 tons of metal, which increased the construction cost by 3.26 million rubles.

Obviously, such phenomena of wasting metal and other construction materials should not exist.

It should be noted that various departments, supervisory bodies, the State Construction Committee, the State Planning Committee, and the Ministry of Finance do not study the economic issues of construction enough.

At this meeting, Comrade Ionis and other comrades said that there is a situation in construction where the budget has lost its meaning. Consequently, in fact, the higher the construction cost of the completed project, the better the performance of the plan, and the higher the total wages and indirect costs. Construction workers strive to complete expensive projects, which is no longer accidental.

In recent years, construction technology, mechanization of construction projects, labor organization, construction materials, and structures have changed greatly. But the allocation system, construction norms, and various regulations and instructions related to the business activities of construction organizations are still the same as in 1936 and 1938. All these hinder the development of the construction industry. Obviously, it is necessary, as after the All-Union Conference of Construction Workers in 1935, to take measures to rectify the allocation of construction funds.

The issues of construction planning and economics should be studied constantly and deeply. It is necessary to make construction workers constantly conduct economic analysis of construction projects and put forward specific suggestions to improve planning work. In addition, it is necessary to entrust a group of workers who do not belong to various departments and supervisory bodies, perhaps the workers of the State Bank (the hall is active) to systematically study the economic issues of construction. Comrades, why do some of you not like the bank? Perhaps some people do not like the bank because this institution is a money-counting institution, and some people hope to get money without counting. But this is not possible.

(Applause)

Increasing labor productivity and training skilled construction workers

The issue of further increasing labor productivity in the construction sector is of great importance. To ensure the continuous increase of labor productivity, it is first necessary to correctly organize work on the construction site, better use labor and machinery, save raw materials, and train a fixed team of skilled construction workers. The increase in labor productivity will increase the wages of construction workers and improve their material living conditions.

Some comrades who spoke at the plenary meeting raised the issue of increasing the wages of construction workers, and this issue was also mentioned in the notes I received. Therefore, some explanations are needed. Everyone knows that we always link the increase in wages with the increase in labor productivity. The increase in labor productivity should exceed the growth of wages, only under these conditions can our society constantly obtain the socialist funds necessary for the expansion of production and the improvement of the material well-being of the people on the basis of the expansion of production. This is the only correct path because we improve the material well-being of the working people, only on the basis of the high rise of the entire national economy. Everyone should understand that in our country, in the process of circulation and in the hands of residents, there should be a correct proportion between the available goods and cash. Only in this way can our currency be stable, our ruble be solid and valuable. Only in this way can actual wages gradually increase. Otherwise, it will not work.

Therefore, to increase the actual wages of the working people, it is necessary to ensure the continuous increase in labor productivity and the continuous increase in the output value of each worker.

How is our increase in labor productivity? According to the instructions of the 19th Party Congress, the increase in labor productivity in the industrial sector in the fifth five-year plan is approximately 50%, in the construction sector 55%, and accordingly, the actual wages should be increased by not less than 35%.

In four years, the labor productivity in the industrial sector has increased by 33%, and in the construction sector by 32%. During this period, actual wages have increased by 37%, which has already exceeded the level of the entire five-year plan. That is, now our total wages have a large surplus. These materials indicate that there are serious shortcomings in the use of technology and the organization of labor in the industrial and construction sectors. Many leaders of organizations, enterprises, and construction bodies have not completed the plans for increasing labor productivity but have adopted the method of increasing the number of employees, which has led to the surplus of total wages.

Everyone knows very well that there is great potential in the construction sector to increase labor productivity and thus increase wages. This is the mechanization of construction projects, the correct use of the powerful technical equipment equipped on our construction sites; this is the transition to industrialized construction methods; this is the improvement of workers' skills, the better use of the advanced experience of innovators, and the strengthening of labor discipline.

Many examples convincingly show that there is great potential in increasing labor productivity and increasing wages. I will only compare two schools built in Moscow in 1954: one is a school built with brick walls in Taukmanov Lane, and the other is a school built with large blocks in the Kutuzov residential area. Look, what a big difference in labor consumption for construction. Building brick walls, constructing eaves, floors, stairs, and partitions cost 7,360 man-days, while the school built with large blocks cost only 1,780 man-days, or the total number of man-days is only 24% of the school built with bricks. The average output value of workers in brick wall construction is 268 rubles per man-day, while in large block construction it is 1,432 rubles, or 4.3 times more. If all the work is considered, then the school with brick wall construction has an output value of 142 rubles per man-day, while the second school has 261 rubles, or 0.8 times more. The use of tower cranes: the first school used 314 crane shifts, while the second school used only 164 crane shifts, or 52% of the first school. Comrades, the potential for increasing labor productivity and increasing wages is here!

One of the most important conditions for increasing labor productivity is the specialization of workers and the improvement of their skills. This issue is closely related to the task of training a fixed team of workers. The high mobility of labor on the construction site has reached an unbearable level. This is because in many construction sites, the training of new workers has not been seriously organized. A collective farmer comes to the construction site, without any skills, as everyone knows, he is counted as an unskilled worker. A person thus does odd jobs, his output value is low, he has no specialty, and his wages are not high. He begins to look around. At this time, some comrades come and tell him: I tell you, give up this job and go to the factory, there you will have skills in half a year, you will be evaluated, and you may even get a house to live in. He considers it again and again and finally leaves. After half a year, he learns skills in the factory, his wages are twice as high as on the construction site. Right? (Shouts from the seats: Right!)

Excavator drivers, truck drivers, concrete workers, hoisting workers, bricklayers--these skilled workers will not leave the construction site. They have skills, do their own specialty, can complete production norms, and the remuneration is not bad.

If we can help every construction worker to master a certain specialty, help him to become a skilled worker who can use high-efficiency technical equipment, then he will love his work and proudly declare: "I am a construction worker!" Unfortunately, on our construction sites, new workers are rarely cared for. There is no unemployment in the Soviet Union. For workers, finding a job is not difficult at all. To make workers stay on the construction site, it is necessary to train them and help them master the skills of a certain trade.

Comrades, in addition, it is undoubtedly necessary to pay more attention to the adjustment of wages. Almost in every department, many wage scales are used, is this normal? Many speakers have correctly talked about this. The suggestion to adjust the wages of construction workers in different departments should be supported. In the same city, the same specialty and construction workers with the same skill level, only because they work on different departmental construction sites, these departments have different unit prices, and they receive different wages, this abnormal phenomenon should be eliminated. Obviously, the cause of this problem is that many economic workers have violated the wage system previously estimated according to the characteristics of each region, the so-called regional wage system. It should be said that in this matter, even the trade unions have not shown the necessary activity.

Various enterprises and trade union organizations must correctly use the material potential of their enterprises to encourage the increase of labor productivity and the output value of each worker on the construction site. In this way, we can ensure the powerful rise of our construction industry, the increase of actual wages, and the continuous improvement of the living standards, material and cultural well-being of construction workers.

Without training mid-level and senior professional cadres, it is impossible to smoothly solve the problem of training a fixed team of skilled construction workers. In the training of professional cadres, we now have incomparably better conditions than before. The general education level of all construction workers has greatly improved. Excellent organizers have been selected from among the workers, and experts who master industrialized construction methods have grown. Many construction sites with advanced technical equipment can and should become good schools for training construction experts.

Now, our country has many young people who have just graduated from ten-year schools, not going to university but participating in production. This is normal and very natural. It is necessary to establish training classes for these young people, teach them skills, and train mid-level professional cadres from them, and I think even senior professional cadres can be trained.

We should seriously study the work of training professional cadres without leaving production, and pay more attention to expanding and improving the work of mid-level and senior correspondence schools and night schools. This work will bring great benefits to the entire national economy. If the Ministry of Higher Education now analyzes how many students enter the first year of university and how many graduate from university, then it can be seen that there are many dropouts in universities. In addition, not all university graduates do their own specialty work. If it can be said that some universities have low efficiency.

On the other hand, advanced and mid-level schools or their branches established in large factories also train highly skilled professional cadres, and these cadres are not leaving production to study and continue to work in their enterprises. For example, the Stalin Automobile Factory has its own institute. Here, many workers study without leaving production. Here, many workers have become excellent students. Workers enter the factory and fall in love with their enterprise and their profession. After obtaining a secondary education, they happily go to night schools, technical schools, or night universities to study, where they graduate and obtain the title of technician or engineer, and continue to work in this factory. And the difference is that when they start studying, they are ordinary workers or foremen, and when they graduate, they can become foremen, technicians, or engineers, and some become workshop directors.

We believe that while improving the work of training professional cadres in existing secondary and higher schools, it is also necessary to more widely carry out the work of training experts from practical workers, these practical workers are the engineering and technical personnel on the construction site and the leaders of workshops and construction sites. It is necessary to organize the training of this type of worker by the method of leaving or not leaving production. Training experts without leaving production takes longer, but this method has its own advantages. Because the university graduates trained without leaving production have a deep understanding of the profession, have rich practical experience. Many engineers who are rich in scientific knowledge and production knowledge, and have become wise through experience, can boldly manage enterprises after passing the final examination. (Applause) Regular university graduates, as usual, have good knowledge, but they need a certain amount of time to learn production and accumulate the necessary practical experience.

The task of further improving our construction work and industrialized construction is to require the party, economic, trade union, and Komsomol organizations to thoroughly improve all the work of training construction workers. Construction workers are engaged in a very important cause for the state. Our responsibility is to take care of and care for them to the smallest detail. This is to pay more attention to and fully meet their growing needs, improve their living and living conditions, better organize mass political work and cultural and educational work, and widely carry out socialist competition among construction workers to complete and overfulfill the plan and increase labor productivity.

A few opinions on road construction and rural construction

Comrades! Please allow me to give a few opinions on road construction and rural construction. Here, it is not necessary to talk again about how important good roads are for our vast country.

We should develop cement concrete roads, which are the best roads. (Applause) Asphalt roads can be used for ten years, while cement concrete roads can be used for a hundred years. Our direction should be the development of the cement industry to pave concrete roads. As the saying goes, we are not rich enough to build cheap and non-durable things. Expensive roads mean solid and durable, we should build such roads so that people forget when they were built! (Applause)

It is necessary to carry out a large-scale construction of production buildings, residential buildings, and granaries in collective farms, state farms, and machine-tractor stations. In these projects, we should also widely use prefabricated reinforced concrete and use blocks as much as possible for construction. For example, in machine-tractor stations, blocks and frame construction can be used. In this way, local building materials should be widely used. Blocks can be made of shell limestone, limestone, bricks, and adobe. All local resources and materials should serve construction.

It is regrettable that there are few suggestions for the use of local building materials. Reed is a very good material for rural construction. In many regions of Ukraine and other republics, houses have been built with reed since ancient times, this is a strange material: it does not rot, has good thermal insulation properties. However, it is not used enough. The walls, partitions, and floors of frame buildings should be made of "Stromit" type boards made of wood chips, straw, and reed, and reed boards and straw boards should be made.

This spring, Comrade Kaneko, the secretary of the Astrakhan Regional Party Committee, asked me to increase the supply of timber to the region. Everyone knows that there is no timber there. Similarly, everyone knows that we must use timber for more important construction.

At that time, I told Comrade Kaneko:

"In your region, there is excellent reed, this is gold, isn't it a building material?"

"Yes, we have reed."

"Can't even a sheep pen be built with reed? You can't find a better material to build a sheep pen than reed."

Comrade Kaneko agreed with this point, although after this conversation, a lot of time has passed, and the matter has not made significant progress.

In Kazakhstan, there is a lot of reed--70% of the country's reed. During the inspection of the virgin lands of Kazakhstan, the issue of using reed was discussed with the leaders of the republic. Comrade Ponamarenko, Comrade Brezhnev, Comrade Dabekov, and other leaders of Kazakhstan found experts who know how to produce reed boards and began to use reed in agricultural construction.

In Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine, there are many reeds in the Dniester, Buk, and Danube reed beds. Reed can be used to build various agricultural buildings, even residential buildings, and make beautiful items, but so far, reed has not been used well, and this issue should be paid attention to!

In rural construction, a wide variety of local building materials should be widely used. In the construction of frame houses, various local materials can be used as fillers. In the Kharkov woodworking factory of Gakhrovsky, there are simple devices for making straw boards and wood chip boards, and as practical experience has shown, the walls made of these boards have good thermal insulation properties. Such devices should be manufactured, and the production of straw boards and wood chip boards should be organized for rural construction.

It is necessary to seriously pay attention to the construction of collective farm houses and the construction of welfare facilities in villages, rural areas, Central Asia, and the Caucasus mountains. In the past, when people were poor, they could not beautify their lives with beautiful houses, now the situation has changed, advanced collective farms, due to the high rise of their farm economy, have a large income, and each labor day of every collective farmer has a high wage income. However, many collective farmers' residential buildings look unpleasant.

It is necessary to build residential buildings that meet the growing cultural needs of collective farmers. Currently, many collective farms and collective farmers have funds to build new houses, but they cannot buy the required building materials because the production of these materials is insufficient.

Comrades, let's consider how to change this situation. Let those collective farms and collective farmers who have the ability to build as many production buildings as possible, cultural life buildings, and residential buildings, and build them as beautifully as possible. It is necessary to remind people to build and help them build. (Applause) To ensure the smooth progress of rural construction, it is also necessary to do a good job in the production of building materials needed for rural construction.

For this purpose, the republics and regional authorities must develop the building materials industry in their regions. This local industry is not limited to the production of bricks, but mainly based on the production of cement. It is necessary to make all the organs of the USSR and the republics build cement plants. At that time, the state will have a large amount of cement to meet the needs of rural construction.

In our country, a huge work is being done to expand the production of goods necessary for the people's life. Many people only call these goods, such as boots, clothing, overcoats, and other household necessities, goods necessary for the people's life. Are the building materials used for residential construction not goods necessary for the people's life? Building materials for residential construction are also extremely necessary goods for the people's life.

It is necessary to comprehensively develop the production of cement, slate, tiles, and other building materials to sell to the countryside. It is necessary to widely produce various prefabricated structures and fittings for agricultural construction and low-rise buildings in collective farms, villages, and suburbs, and sell them to the working people. This approach is beneficial to both the state and the residents.

By increasing the production of building materials and promoting them to the countryside, we can greatly accelerate the transformation of our villages and villages, and make them beautiful, pleasant, and beautify people's lives. (Applause)

Finally, let's talk about the construction of cinemas. In cities, especially in rural areas, there are still not enough cinemas, and more cinemas need to be built, and more high-quality films need to be produced. This is an indispensable major work for the continuous rise of people's culture and the spiritual life of the Soviet people.

Comrades! The power of the Soviet state is growing year by year. The rapid development of our national economy, the continuous improvement of the well-being and cultural level of the people, is the result of the correct Leninist policy of the Communist Party. All our achievements are a testament to the unity of the Soviet people, a testament to the loyalty of the Soviet people to the cause of communism.

In the thirty-seven years since the great October Socialist Revolution, our country has transformed from a backward country under the tsarist regime into an advanced and powerful socialist power. The historic victory of our people can be said to have shaken the world, this is the result of the great superiority of the Soviet system.

The great Lenin founded our party, tempered it in the revolutionary struggle, and led it to the great cause of communist construction. And the whole people follow our party. Now, the whole world recognizes the power of the Soviet Union, recognizes it as a great power in the world, even the imperialists have to admit this. This is achieved by the Soviet people under the leadership of the party that has been tested by time. This is the embodiment of the ideas of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. (A long, stormy applause)

On the basis of our achievements, in the future, while continuing to exert all efforts to develop heavy industry, we will continue to strengthen the power of our motherland, struggle for the further development of the national economy, and struggle for the improvement of the well-being of the people. In this great creative cause of communist construction, the numerous army of construction workers plays a huge role.

Comrades! This conference has been very successful, and many correct suggestions have been put forward. These suggestions are very meaningful and valuable. The hundreds of thousands of construction workers in various regions of the Soviet Union will be familiar with these suggestions and the valuable experience already available. The conference proves that our construction workers understand the tasks before them. They have a strong desire to improve the construction work of industrial enterprises in order to continuously strengthen the industrial power of the Soviet state, to build more quality residential buildings and other buildings for the motherland.

If we summarize the valuable experience mentioned at the conference and seriously implement these suggestions, adopt various advanced methods, and if we resolutely fight to eliminate all kinds of shortcomings, then we can save a large amount of funds and materials, greatly accelerate the turnover of funds, accelerate the progress of construction projects, and improve their quality.

It is necessary to instruct Comrade Sokolov, the chairman of the State Construction Committee, and the ministers, especially the ministers of the construction departments, to study all the materials and speeches of the conference. At the same time, please submit the outlines of the speeches of the comrades who did not have the opportunity to speak at the conference, and these outlines must also be considered. After summarizing all the materials of the conference, it is necessary to draft some specific suggestions. These suggestions can be divided into three categories: the first category is suggestions that must be implemented nationwide; the second category is suggestions that can and should be implemented within the departments of the Union; the third category is suggestions related to the union republics and regions. It is necessary to establish necessary supervision over the implementation of these suggestions.

It is necessary to pay special attention to the summary and promotion of various advanced methods in construction. (Applause)

If it is good to hold such conferences in various regions and some departments, it is necessary to summarize advanced experience at these conferences, especially to summarize advanced experience in industrialized construction, and to criticize all our shortcomings at these conferences, as they say, "grind off the dirt with diamond dust," and not be afraid to touch the sore spots of friends. This will be able to discover new great potential and make it serve our common cause.

Comrades! In conclusion, I am convinced that the workers of construction, architects, structural engineers, the construction materials industry, construction machinery and road machinery manufacturing, design organizations, and scientific research institutions will certainly be able to honorably complete the tasks assigned to them by the party and the government; will certainly be able to further improve the level, speed, and quality of our construction; will be able to put factories, mines, and power stations into production more quickly; will certainly be able to build more economical, more solid, and more beautiful residential buildings, schools, and hospitals. Comrades! See you at the next conference of construction workers, wishing you new achievements! (A long, stormy applause, everyone stands up)

    论在建筑中广泛采用工业化方法，改善质量和降低造价
    ——一九五四年十二月七日在全苏建筑工作者、建筑师以及建筑材料工业、建筑机械和筑路机械制造工业、设计机构和科学研究机构工作人员会议上的讲话
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志们！
    我们很久没有召开全苏建筑工作者会议了，而召开这个会议是非常必要的。我想，这个会议不仅对建筑工程，就是对我们工业部门以及国民经济其他部门的各种工作，也有很大益处。
    苏联人民在共产党的领导下，在我们国家工业化方面获得了巨大的成就。苏联的工人阶级、集体农民和知识分子，都以这些成就而感到自豪，我们国外的朋友们也都以这些成就而感到高兴。
    苏维埃国家工业化之所以能够实现，是由于我们党坚定不移地执行了列宁和斯大林的指示。工业化曾是我们主要的任务，就是在将来也还是主要的任务。我们今后也应该尽全力发展重工业。重工业是国民经济的基础，是社会主义国家经济实力和国防力量的泉源，是劳动人民的富裕生活和文化生活的根源。只有进一步发展重工业，我们才能够顺利地使国民经济的所有部门向前推进，才能不断地提高人民的福利，才能使苏联的边疆不受侵犯。（长时间的鼓掌）
    这是主要的。进一步发展重工业——扩大金属、采煤、石油、电力、化学产品的生产，发展重型机械制造、车床制造，发展锻冶及锻冲压设备的生产——就是顺利地提高工农业各部门的有力的基础。
    在发展重工业所获得的成就上，党和政府也非常重视发展人民生活必需品的生产。
    今年在执行党中央委员会全体会议关于进一步发展农业的决议方面，作了很多工作。大家知道，共产党把提高全国各地农作物产量和开垦荒地以增加谷物生产视为最重要的任务之一。
    一九五四年是为实现迅速提高农业的计划而斗争的第一年。各位知道，今年在乌克兰、伏尔加河流域以及其他南方地区的气候条件很不好。在这些地区内，由于旱灾使我们谷物歉收的情况非常严重。但西伯利亚，特别是阿尔泰边疆区和哈萨克斯坦今年大力地支援了祖国。阿尔泰边疆区、西伯利亚地区、哈萨克共和国的集体农庄庄员们、拖拉机站工作者、国营农场工作者以及党组织的工作人员工作得都很好，为国家作了很多事情。尽管在南方各地区发生歉收，到今年十二月五日为止，全国粮食产量比去年同时期的产量增加了两亿七千一百万普特。
    从党中央委员会和苏联部长会议十一月八日在报纸上所公布的农业年度总结中，大家都知道了这些数字。根据这些数字，大家知道在一九五四年我们收购的粮食、肉类、牛奶、蔬菜，比去年增加很多。的确增加了很多。有些人提出一个问题：尽管今年农业产品的征购和收购总量在增加，但在商店中还有时买不到需要的东西，这个事实如何解释呢？为什么会这样呢？这是因为对生活必需品的需求有了很大的提高，是因为人民的钱更多了。商品的价格减低了数十亿卢布，工人、职员的实际工资和集体农庄庄员的收入增加了很多。（鼓掌）
    正是因为如此，不论我们如何增加商品的生产，总不能完全满足人民的要求。每当在我国各地和集体农庄庄员谈话的时候，经常会听到他们要求卖给他们更多的砂糖、皮鞋、毛织物，而质量当然是要上等的。对商品质量要求的不断增长，这是党和政府为提高劳动人民购买力创造条件而采取措施的结果。我们的任务是：更充分地满足人民不断增长的要求。因此今后必须要更有步骤地、更坚决地为进一步增产谷物、马铃薯、蔬菜、肉类、织物以及其他商品而斗争。
    在扩大谷物生产方面，我们已经打下了良好的基础。一九五四年预定开荒一千三百万公顷，而实际开垦了一千七百四十三万公顷。开垦荒地中的这些巨大成绩，是我国集体农庄庄员、拖拉机站工作人员、国营农场工作人员以及工人阶级的忘我劳动的结果。全体人民都已认识到必须完成这个任务。（鼓掌）
    可以满怀信心地说，在一九五五年由于开垦荒地而增加的播种面积将不少于两千万公顷。（鼓掌）
    在增加谷物生产的同时，我们也为农业各部门的进一步提高而创造了条件。这对于发展畜牧业更为必要。我们主要是需要饲料谷物，因为我们的粮食已经够用了。随着增加饲料谷物的生产，集体农庄和国营农场将生产更多的肉类、牛奶、奶油、蛋品、毛类。我们需要更多的谷物，是为了使我国有大量的储备粮食，同时也用粮食来发展和其他国家之间的贸易。
    党和政府在发展工业和农业方面采取的措施，是为了进一步巩固苏维埃国家的威力，是为了不断地提高我国人民的福利。在这个事业上，逐年不断发展的建筑工业部门中的工作人员——我们的建筑工作者、建筑材料工业工作者、以技术供应工地的建筑机械制造者、建筑师、结构工程师以及我们广大的建筑大军——起着很重要的作用。这就是党中央和苏联部长会议决定召开这个会议的原因。这个会议是为了和大家共同讨论建筑中所存在的重要问题，揭发存在的缺点，拟定根本改善建筑事业的具体措施。
    建筑工业化中的迫切问题
    同志们！我国正在进行大规模的建设。为了说明其工程量，应该提一下，苏维埃国家在战后时期对国民经济中基本建设的投资已达九千多亿卢布。在这一时期内恢复和新建的大型国营工业企业有八千多个，并都已投入了生产。我们每年都在扩大着学校、医院和居住建筑的建设。战后在城市和职工居住区内为工人和职员建造了总面积达两亿平方公尺以上的居住房屋；在农村为集体农庄庄员和农业知识分子建造了四百五十万幢住宅。
    今年全国的建筑安装工程量比一九四六年增加了一倍半以上，仅一九五四年一年中用于基本建设的投资就相等于第二个五年计划用于同一目的的全部投资。
    作为我们经济基础的基础——重工业企业的建设又向前迈了新的一大步。今后我们的重点都应该是建设新的采煤、石油、冶金、机械制造工业、新的水电站以及其他工业企业。同时，在全国还将展开大量的居住建筑。今年在城市和工人居住区内将完成面积为三千万平方公尺以上的居住房屋建筑以及在农村中将建造四十万幢住宅，这就足以说明了。
    为了顺利地完成摆在我们面前的建筑任务，必须大力发展并改进我们的建筑工业，还应当坚决地清除各建筑事业机构中所存在的手工业方式。
    现在我们已具备着建筑工程广泛工业化的必要条件。这些条件又是什么呢？首先我们已培养出很多熟练的工人干部和专家，在我国的建筑机构及建筑材料工业部门中有数万个各行的能手和生产革新者在工作着，我们现在已有许多能供应建筑工作者现代化技术装备的工厂，这些工厂能够减轻他们的劳动和提高他们的劳动生产率。我们已建立了并还在扩展着建筑基地来生产各种装配式钢筋混凝土结构、配件以及建筑材料以供应建筑工程的需要。
    从这个会议可以看出，在我们建筑事业中是有一定的成绩的，但同时也存在着很多的缺点。我们应该彻底揭发这些缺点，并动员所有的力量来消灭这些缺点。揭发缺点是要勇敢、尖锐、找出具体的错误负责者，因为缺点不是自己产生的，而是由某些工作人员所造成的。批评不应该无的放矢，要对那些犯错误的人或缺点负责者展开批评，以及对那些看到缺点、容忍缺点而又不去纠正这些缺点的人们予以批评。
    进一步实行建筑工业化是根本改进建筑事业的决定性条件。
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议在“关于在建筑中发展装配式钢筋混凝土结构和配件生产”的决议中，制定了增产钢筋混凝土制品的全面计划。这一定会保证建筑工程过渡到采用工业化的方法。
    广泛地扩展装配式钢筋混凝土结构及配件的生产，我们就会得到很大的经济效果。建筑工作者们都知道在不久以前在这方面我们还有过争论，就是在建筑中我们应该走哪条道路：是采用装配式结构、还是采用整体混凝土呢？有些人曾企图把建筑工作者们拖向采用整体混凝土的道路。我们不预备提出这些人的姓名，也不责备他们。我想这些同志现在自己也都觉察到他们过去所坚持的观点是错误的。现在看来大家都已很明确我们是应该走采用装配式钢筋混凝土结构及配件的比较先进的道路。
  （鼓掌）
    如果在建筑工程中采用整体混凝土的话，随之而来的是什么呢？这必然会造成建筑工地上的混乱，我们势必采用各种不同式样和结构的模板，浪费更多的钢材，会引起水泥的飞扬以及混凝土和惰性材料的损耗。
    而采用装配式配件的结果又是怎样呢？采用装配式钢筋混凝土以后，就可能像机器制造业那样地来生产配件；就可能使建筑过渡到采用工厂化的方法。（鼓掌）
    采用装配式建筑使我们更可能节约资金，节约建筑材料，提高产量，从而也增加建筑工作者们的工资。例如对那些单层工业厂房如能采用钢筋混凝土结构来代替钢结构，则钢材的消耗将减少一半以上，与采用整体混凝土相比较，则其劳动量可降低三分之二左右；而应用于居住建筑上，则木料的需要量又可减少百分之二十到二十五。此外，钢筋混凝土结构不易腐蚀，既耐久，又防火。
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议的决议已规定了要在最近三年内新建四百零二个工厂和二百个露天预制场来生产装配式钢筋混凝土结构和配件。在这三年中装配式钢筋混凝土的生产将增加四倍，因此水泥和惰性材料的生产也都将增加一半以上。
    在谈到采用装配式钢筋混凝土结构的特点时，有些同志要问：“应该采用哪种结构呢？是偏重于骨架预制板结构，还是无骨架的大型预制板结构呢？”我认为现在还不应对某一种结构作出任何宣判，应该向两个方向发展。很可能经过事实证明，这两个方向可以同时并存。因为我们是在各种不同条件下建造各种不同用途的房屋，实践会证明这两种结构--骨架预制板结构和大型预制板结构--哪一种更实用。它们是各有优点的。在我们的会议上，赞成和反对这两种建筑方法的人都作了发言，但是谁也没有证明哪一种方法是不能使用的。
    毫无疑义，在采用钢筋混凝土墙板建造房屋的同时，也应当广泛地采用大型及小型筑墙砌块来建造房屋。
    大型砌块建筑的造价比采用砖的建筑要降低百分之十二，而装配程度却要提高百分之三十八到八十五。采用大型砌块的建筑还可大大地提高劳动生产率：两个瓦工八小时能砌砖墙三·五立方公尺，而在同样的时间内，两个安装工能安装大型砌块的墙壁二十五立方公尺。
    必须推广装配式钢筋混凝土结构、配件和大型砌块。不要等待钢筋混凝土工厂建成后再推广。而且，制造筑墙砌块并不需要特别的工厂。在工地上可以利用电热、或蒸气加热混凝土来制造砌块，这并不需要什么复杂的设备。
    在建造房屋中安装楼板是主要的工作之一。结构工程师和建筑工作者对于选择预制楼板的结构问题，曾予以极大的注意。
    有些同志建议我们只采用马克洛夫工程师的预制多孔空心楼板。因为制造这些楼板并不复杂，所以我们应当尽量广泛地组织这种生产。但依我来看，预制密肋楼板具有更多的优点。它们是很有前途的：因为制造这种板可以节省材料，特别是钢材。这是非常重要的；预制板结构的隔音能力很好，密肋预制板的成本也远低于其他的预制板。应该争取如何能生产更多的机械来制造预制密肋楼板。但是在那些没有工厂条件来制造预制密肋楼板的地方就要合理地组织预制多孔空心楼板的生产。广泛地使用预制楼板以后，我们就可以在工地中把使用整体混凝土的这种“手工业者”从工地排挤出去。
    还应当提出建造楼梯方面的缺点。现在还有许多工地从工厂方面得到了表面都没有经过很好加工的钢筋混凝土的楼梯段和楼梯平台。所以在工地上不得不在安好楼梯段和楼梯平台之后另行装饰，墙板和楼板也常有这种情况，这是错误的。钢筋混凝土配件的一切加工工作都应在工厂内全部完成。出厂的楼梯段的背面应该经过装饰和加工，踏步也须经过装饰。楼梯平台同样应有已加工的背面，并铺有面砖或水磨石。为了保护它在施工时不受损坏，表面应用纸贴上，并盖上木板。
    在工厂里同样必须做好墙板和楼板的装修工作。运到工地上的制品应当是完备的、只等安装的成品。否则如果我们在工厂中制造装配式配件，把它们安装在八层楼上，随后又要考虑如何上去进行这些表面的修饰和加工工作，那么预制安装的优点又在哪里呢？
    混凝土结构应当是轻便的，不应过于沉重。
    我们必须特别注意采用薄的成型的装配式结构，这种结构与笨重的混凝土结构比较起来有许多优点。其重量大约可减少百分之三十三，水泥的用量可减少百分之二十，造价可降低百分之十五。
    在工厂中有振动器、振动台、机械压模机及其他机械，这样就使我们有可能在制造配件和结构时采用干硬混凝土来代替塑性混凝土。使用干硬混凝土就可以很快拆模，并能得到强度很高的制品。采用干硬混凝土的效果就在于因减少模型的数目而加快生产的速度，在于提高制品的质量，节约做模型用的钢材和减少模板的拆装费用。我们应以主人翁的态度对待这些问题，只有在那些没有工厂，不能进行钢筋混凝土制品工厂化生产的地方，才应暂时采用塑性混凝土。
    在建筑中广泛地采用装配式钢筋混凝土制品，我们就可能大量地缩减木料和钢材的使用。同志们，应该承认我们还没有真正学会珍惜和节约像木料和钢材这些最贵重的材料。今后决不能容忍这样的浪费现象。
    许多人抱怨说没有木料。不错，木料是不够的，但同时木料的使用仍是浪费的。以交通部为例，铁道的枕木用的全是木料，里程标志用的全是好几公尺长的铁轨。架线塔、天桥和涵管-全是用钢材做的。难道所有这些都不能用钢筋混凝土来代替吗？比如，为什么我们不能向捷克人学习呢，他们制造了出色的钢筋混凝土枕木，因此而节省了木料。请到他们那里去看看吧，他们是我们的朋友，他们是很愿意把经验告诉我们的。
    我和布尔加宁同志，米高扬同志以及代表团的其他团员们访问中国时见到许多钢筋混凝土的电线杆和架线塔，而且造得很好。我们应该吸取这有益的经验。
    在我们到达远东的时候，我们参观了一些工厂，这些工厂大部分都是采用金属结构的，而几乎完全没有采用装配式的钢筋混凝土。为什么会发生这种现象呢？因为有些领导同志允许把各车间的骨架完全采用钢结构，他们的理由是，这样做可以提前完工。但这是不正确的。
    同志们！必须坚决地消灭浪费钢材的现象。只有在那些必须使用钢材的地方，才应当使用钢材来建造房屋，在建筑中所有能用混凝土或钢筋混凝土来代替的地方，都应该用它们来代替。（鼓掌）
    在讨论建筑工业化问题的时候，我们不能不谈到建筑材料生产的发展问题，因为我们需要大量的建筑材料。我认为国家计划委员会和今天到会的许多同志对于这一个严重的缺点都负有责任。这个缺点就是现在在发展建筑材料工业方面，当我们应该用尽一切力量来发展水泥工业的时候，我们却以建造砖厂为重点。（鼓掌）
    砖是一种主要的建筑材料，我们过去和现在都把砖用于主要以手工业方式来进行的建筑工程中。在这种情况下，墙壁材料的重量和砖的重量是有很大意义的。目前当我们有了混凝土、电动机、起重机及其他机械设备时，我们就决不能再继续采用旧的工作方法。大家都知道，制造砖要费很多时间和劳动。在制砖过程中首先要取得粘土，加以拌和，制成砖坯，干燥后放入窑内焙烧，再放入堆栈内，以后又运到工地，搬到脚手架上，再砌成墙。所有这些工作都得反来覆去地做，还得像挑选马赛克那样挑选每块砖。
    采用混凝土砌块来代替砖块不是更好吗？这些砌块的尺寸正适合于现有的两吨、三吨、五吨的起重设备。用砌块来进行建筑可以达到很高的劳动生产率和很高的工作量，在其他一些国家的建筑中都广泛地采用混凝土而不采用砖，这并不是偶然的。
    目前，当广泛地实行工业化施工的任务已经摆在我们面前的时候，必须大力发展水泥工业，以保证混凝土生产的大量增长。
    但是，这并不是说，我们已不需要重视利用现有制砖工厂的潜力来提高砖的产量问题了。
    著名的革新者杜万诺夫同志曾在我们的会上发言。他令人信服地指出：现有的制砖工厂可以把砖的生产量提高一半或一倍。如果采用杜万诺夫同志所提出的、并已为许多企业的实践所证实的先进烧砖方法，则完全可以达到这样的产量。砖仍将是砌墙的主要材料。因此，在混凝土配件还没有代替砖之前，我们必须大力地改进砖的生产。
    此外，我们还必须为争取在施工中更合理地使用砖而进行一系列的工作。在这里发言的马尔采夫和什尔可夫同志讲述了向工地合理化运砖的方法。采用砖笼运砖对建筑工程有很大的好处。然而，我们现在必须继续前进，在制砖工厂中必须把砖制成砌块以代替用砖笼来运输。比如：捷克斯洛伐克就已经在这样做了，大家都知道，列布利珂夫工程师已经把这一方面的初步经验运用于斯大林格勒工程中了，制做砖砌块的时候，应使砖砌块表面的修饰也在工厂制好。这样，在用砖砌块砌墙时，就可省却任何现场的补充加工工作。
    同志们！顺利地采用工业化方法和改善建筑机构的工作，在很大程度上有赖于领导建筑工程的组织技术水平。
    以小型建筑机构的力量是不可能实现建筑工业化、提高建筑速度和降低工程造价的。因此，必须合并建筑机构。目前，苏联总共有七千五百多个承包建筑机构，其中三分之一的年度工程量均未超过五百万卢布。例如在列宁格勒就有一百三十三个承包性质的建筑机构，基辅有一百零七个，罗斯托夫市有五十六个……而各工厂自营的小型建筑机构又有多少？更是数不清。建筑机构的数量不是在逐渐减少，而是在逐年增多。
    如果我们今后仍然不断地增加建筑机构的数目，那末我们就无法真正地提出建筑工业化的问题。谁都明了，小型的、因而必然是薄弱的建筑机构是没有力量应用工业化施工方法的。我们必须坚决地走上合并建筑机构的道路，否则就根本谈不上什么建筑工业化的问题了。
    在这一方面，莫斯科建筑机构合并的经验完全可以引为借镜。在莫斯科市苏维埃、各部和各机关所属的五十六个建筑工程公司的基础上，合并成立了一个统一的机构--莫斯科居住和民用建筑工程总局。当讨论成立莫斯科居住和民用建筑工程总局问题的时候，曾有许多说法，有人说莫斯科市苏维埃管理不了如此庞大的机构，有人担心如果各部都摆脱这件工作，恐怕居住房屋的建筑计划就完不成了。尽管可以假定，在莫斯科居住和民用建筑工程总局成立的第一年，可能产生某些组织方面的缺点，而影响任务的完成。但是这些顾虑是没有根据的。莫斯科居住和民用建筑工程总局局长库琴林珂同志在这里报告了合并建筑工程机构的结果，并告诉我们，在今年内要完成供应莫斯科居民九十万平方公尺居住面积的任务，同时作好一九五五年建筑工程的准备工作。一九五五年任务的规模，比过去
  一年还要巨大。
      这些事实表明新机构已经向前迈进了一大步。因为建筑工程的准备工作是很重要的，我甚至要说，这是重要之中的最重要的。（鼓掌）大家都明白，没有正常的准备工作就难以使建筑工程均衡地进行。没有准备工作，熟练的工人就不能从事本专业的工作而去做土方和附属工程。结果必然降低工人的劳动生产率，增加建筑工程造价，推迟工程竣工日期。反之，作好准备工作，发挥工人的专长，就能保证工作均衡地和不间断地进行。只有大的工程机构才有力量组织正常的准备工作。
    在列宁格勒、基辅和其它城市中也应当以莫斯科为例合并建筑机构。但是，必须考虑周密地、合理地来进行这一工作。强大的建筑机构之所以必须建立，是因为只有这样才能在建筑工程中大规模地采用钢筋混凝土装配式结构和配件，才能使建筑工程全盘机械化，才能提高劳动生产率，加快建筑速度，改进质量和降低工程造价。
    莫斯科和其它城市的经验证明，必须建立专业性的建筑机构，而且只能是建立专业性的而不是综合性的建筑机构。因为只有这样的机构才能采用建筑工程工业化的方法。（鼓掌）
    专业性建筑机构能够更好地组织工人劳动，提高工人的业务水平，使机械发挥更高的效率。例如，在莫斯科曾建立了“基础工程”公司，专门平整建筑场地，进行土方工程、基础工程和砌筑地下室墙（用混凝土或钢筋混凝土配件和砌块）。此外，也有这样一些工程公司，只作一般的建筑工程，像装砌墙壁（如果建筑是采用大型砌块或钢筋混凝土预制板建筑的话），安装楼梯、楼板和其它工程，间隔墙的安装、室内的装饰则由专门的专业机构来担任。卫生工程也是由专门的专业机构来完成。同时还有一些专业机构专门做电气工程，安装电梯等工程。
    专业分工愈细密，生产力才会愈高，工程质量才会愈好。只有这样，工人的工资也才会高。凡是没有专业分工和各种工程都由一个公司或工程处来完成的地方，那里工人的工资就不可能高。今天作瓦工、油漆工，而明天又作搬运工，显然，在这样的情况下，工人的工资当然是不会高的。
    建筑机构专业化能够使工作更灵活，更机动，更迅速，更有效。着手建筑工厂和居住房屋之前，先由土方工程和平整工程专业机构平整场地，砌置基础，敷设各种地下管线。与此同时，另一个专业机构即应准备进行建筑物的装配式结构的安装工作。在这样组织工作的情况下，一切工程就可以按照工程配合进度表进行，如果建筑的是工厂，安装房屋结构的同时，就可以安装机器设备。这样组织建筑工程，不论在战争时期或战后时期，我们都有过很多例子。
    显而易见，各专业机构不可能永远停留在一个地方，当它完成自己的工作之后，就必须转往另一工程。应当说，建立地区性的专业建筑机构的决定是最正确的。然而，并不是所有的地方都已具备了建立这种机构的条件。因此，暂时只好在各部之下建立专业机构。
    我们正在大规模地建设工厂、居住房屋、学校、医院及其它建筑物。这些建筑有着非常重要的意义。我们必须急剧地提高速度，改进质量，降低造价。完成这一任务的唯一道路，就是最广泛地实行建筑工业化。
    消除设计工作中的缺点，改进建筑师的工作
    同志们，建筑工业化的成绩，建筑质量的提高和工程造价的降低，在极大程度上是取决于设计机构，取决于建筑师和结构工程师的工作的。
    由于我国在大规模地建筑着工厂、居住房屋、学校、医院和文化生活机关等，我们是不能容忍设计工作的落后现象的。我国到处都在建设，苏联政府每年在建设方面要拨出好几十亿卢布，可以说我们每个人都十分关心建设，都希望它能进行得很好。我们对于那种由于设计机构工作的迟缓而拖延了建筑工程的现象，有时甚至设计一些普通的建筑物也要拖上两年或更长的时间的现象，是不能容忍的。
    为了建筑工业化的利益，必须改组设计机构的工作，必须使编制标准设计和运用现有的标准设计变成设计机构的主要工作。
    广泛地运用装配式钢筋混凝土配件、结构、大型砌块和新的效能高的材料，已成为建筑技术中的新事物，它无条件地要求摒弃那些陈旧的设计手法。（鼓掌）
    但是，许多规划和设计机构的工作人员对于标准设计的意义却估计不足。
    下列事实可以说明这一点，在全国一千一百个建筑设计机构中，部分地搞标准设计的只有一百五十二个。一九五一-一九五三年间，用在标准设计工作中的资金还不到全部设计工作所用资金的百分之一。一九五三年，按照标准设计建造的工业建筑，只占工业建筑总量的百分之十二，而今年的情况也没有多大的改进。
    我曾经同许多工程师和建筑师谈过设计问题。他们都同意标准设计能大大地简化和改进建筑。但是在实践中，许多建筑师、结构工程师，在工业建筑中有时还有一些工艺技师，都力求创造自己的单独设计。
    为什么会产生这样的情况呢？显然，其中的一个原因就是我们在培养建筑师的工作上是有缺点的。许多年轻的建筑师，刚刚跨出学校的大门，还没有站稳脚跟，就想学建筑大师那样只愿意设计单独性质的建筑物，想马上为自己树立纪念碑。如果说，普希金为自己建立了非工人所能建造的纪念碑，那么许多建筑师却总想用他单独设计的房屋给自己建立“人工的”纪念碑。（笑声，鼓掌）
    必须懂得，如果我们都按照单独的设计来建造所有的工业建筑物、居住房屋和其它建筑物，那么，就会大大地降低建筑速度和增加工程造价。
    许多设计工作者--建筑师和结构工程师，的确是在创造性地工作着，他们在工作中作了很多新的和有益的贡献，但是在他们的工作中也存在着很大的缺点。有些设计工作者没有考虑在设计中采用由建筑工业的工厂所生产的结构、配件和建筑材料，并且到现在还是以那些落后的建筑方法为出发点。
    就以居住房屋的建设为例，为什么不选用那些最好的、设备完善的居住房屋的设计并在建设中多次地重复使用呢？让建筑师们以竞赛的方式提出这样的居住房屋设计吧！
    目前特别需要选择优秀的大型砌块的居住房屋设计。一九五三年莫斯科市苏维埃所属设计机构拟制了一批由大型砌块和大型预制板建筑的居住房屋设计方案。当时认为苏联建筑科学院院士伊·夫·若尔托夫斯基所提出的方案是最好的一个。那时本来应该根据这个方案进行设计，并把它当作标准设计在这几年内建造一些大型砌块的居住房屋，但是并没有这样做。
    为什么现在要采用三十八种学校的标准设计呢？这样是合理的吗？很明显，这样做是因为很多工作人员没有以经济的观点来对待建筑事业。
    应该在居住房屋、学校、医院、幼儿园、托儿所、商店和其他建筑物方面，选择有限数量的标准设计，譬如，在五年之内，先按照这些设计进行大规模的建设。过了这段时间后再讨论一下，如果没有更好的设计，那么把这些设计的使用期限再延长五年，同志们！这样做有什么不好呢！
    按照标准设计进行建筑有什么优点呢？优点是非常多的。譬如我想盖房子，设计已经有现成的了，这项建筑需要多大的地段，需要那些结构和材料，需要多少工人，这些全都很清楚。有了这些条件，我们就可以加快建筑速度，降低工程造价。
    再以工业房屋和建筑物的设计问题为例。工业房屋的设计和居住房屋的标准设计一样，也是用多次重复使用的标准单元和标准跨度组成的。在每个跨度中，柱子、横梁、吊车梁以及其他配件都是不变的。编制工业房屋标准设计时，应考虑到在建筑物中布置各种不同工业部门的生产车间及辅助车间的可能性。不同用途的建筑物可由同样的建筑构件来建造。因此在拟制工业建筑的标准设计时，必须采用统一的柱网和统一的楼层高度，统一的荷载，统一的楼梯间、窗口和门口等。
    使用这种标准设计就有可能预先组织大规模的建筑配件和结构的生产，并由一般的建筑施工方法转为装配式的施工方法，这样工程就可以在很短的时间内完成。同志们！我们一定要做到这一点。
    为了推广标准设计，我们应该有决心和毅力，因为在这个问题上我们可能会遇到阻力。当然，应该向某些人好好地说明这种工作的必要性。
    无论从节约资金方面或是从加速建筑及提高建筑质量方面来看，在建筑中使用标准设计都会取得巨大的效果。这是毫无疑义的。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    同志们！我想和你们谈一下我对建筑师工作的一些感想和意见。首先我想提到建筑科学院院长莫尔德维诺夫同志。我同您，莫尔德维诺夫同志，由于工作的关系，在莫斯科是经常碰面的。我知道您是一个很好的组织者；您在建筑大卡路加街的快速流水作业施工中已经表现出了您的组织才能。那时快速流水作业施工还是第一次实行，并且是在莫尔德维诺夫同志的参与下进行的。但是战后，莫尔德维诺夫同志变了。他已经不是从前的莫尔德维诺夫了。正如歌剧“沙皇的未婚妻”中所唱的一样：我“已经不认识格利高里·格良兹诺夫了！”（笑声，鼓掌）
    在我们的建筑中经常可以看到浪费资金的现象。在这方面，许多建筑师负有很大的责任，因为他们在按照单独设计所建造的建筑物的建筑艺术装饰上造成了浪费。
    像这样的建筑师已经是建筑工业化道路上的绊脚石了。为了能够顺利地、迅速地进行建筑，就必须按照标准设计来进行，但是，很显然，这一点是不合某些建筑师的胃口的。
    莫尔德维诺夫同志在这次大会上的报告和某些建筑师的发言，说明他们回避了建设中的经济问题，对于每平方公尺居住面积的造价不感兴趣。
    建筑师应当像所有的建筑工作者一样，立即注意建筑中的经济问题，深入地钻研这个问题。必须永远记住，建筑中最重要的问题之一，就是所盖房屋的造价，就是每平方公尺面积的造价。
    一个建筑师，如果想不落在生活的后面，那他不仅应该知道和会使用建筑艺术形式、装饰品和各种不同的装饰配件，而且应该知道新的、进步的建筑材料，钢筋混凝土结构和配件。他首先应该精通建筑的经济问题，正是因为这个问题，在这次大会上对莫尔德维诺夫和他的许多同事提出了批评。因为他们在设计一个建筑物时，忘掉了主要的东西--忘记了每平方公尺面积的造价。他们醉心于那些不必要的立面装饰，造成了许多浪费。
    有时，在居住房屋的立面上摆了许多不必要的装饰物，它们说明了某些建筑师是缺乏鉴赏力的。这使得建筑工程人员有时甚至非常难于去完成这些装饰任务。
    在这方面，高层房屋的建筑有很大的影响。在设计高层建筑时，建筑师主要是注意建立建筑物的立体轮廓，而不去考虑这些建筑物的建筑费用和使用过程中的费用。
    仅是为了装饰而特别做一些复杂凸凹的墙壁，就会由于使热能受到很多损失而过多地增加维持费。例如，斯摩棱斯克广场上的那座楼房，因为这个原因每年就浪费掉二十五万卢布的燃料费。仅仅这一个建筑物就是这样。
    我想举一些高层房屋建筑面积分配的资料。
                   （以百分比计算）
           靠近红门的高层建筑   斯摩棱斯克广场上的高层建筑总建筑面积　           一○○　           一○○主要使用房间所占的面积  二八·一　         三○辅助房间所占面积        二三·一　        二四工程设备及服务性的房间所占面积　一四·九　 二结构所占面积　                 三三·九　 三五
    从上面列举的材料中可以看出，在高层建筑中主要面积是很少的，而所谓结构面积则占得很多。什么叫做结构面积？这就是墙壁和结构所占用的面积。在高层建筑中，为了创造轮廓线，这种面积是大大地超过了定额。这种面积仅能供观赏，而在这些面积上居住和工作是不行的。（会场活跃，笑声，鼓掌）
    可能有人说，高层建筑不管怎样还是漂亮的，也许，对它们的批评是不恰当的吧，从前人们不是都在夸奖它们吗？我们的意见是最好能严厉地批评它们的缺点，因为，如果现在我们不这样做，那么摹仿高层建筑的情形将会风行起来，结果就会过多地增加所谓“结构面积”。（笑声，鼓掌）
    当莫尔德维诺夫同志发言的时候，我向他提出关于按照他的设计而正在修建的高层建筑“乌克兰旅馆”的造价问题。应该说，莫尔德维诺夫同志并没有落后于那些在建筑装饰上造成浪费的人们，而且是同他们并驾齐驱的。在“乌克兰旅馆”中每平方公尺主要面积的造价等于“莫斯科旅馆”每平方公尺面积的造价的百分之一百七十五。
    在同一个城市莫斯科，按照不同作者的设计来建造的居住房屋，每平方公尺居住面积的造价差额竟达六百到八百卢布，难道这是能容忍的吗？
    在莫斯科，许多居住房屋的外部装饰费用占建筑物总造价的百分之十五到二十，有的甚至到百分之三十，而按定额规定为百分之八到九。这种现象也是不能容忍的。
    同志们！在一些基本问题方面--必须建造舒适方便的居住房屋，我们和建筑师之间是没有分歧的，这是一个重要的问题，这是关于一个人生活上的方便的问题。在少居室和多居室住户的数量，它们的大小，房间的高度等问题上，一般说，是没有什么分歧的。但是一旦问题牵涉到建筑物立面的艺术装饰时，往往就会产生分歧。关于建筑物的艺术装饰问题是一个最复杂的问题。
    有些建筑师热中于在建筑物上面建造尖塔，这样就使得这些建筑物像教堂一样。您喜欢不喜欢教堂的立体轮廓？我不想在个人兴趣问题上进行争辩，但是，对于居住房屋来说，这样的外貌是不必要的。不应该把现代的居住房屋的艺术形式变成和教堂或博物馆的一样。这样并不会使住的人感到任何方便和舒适，相反，只能使建筑物使用起来不方便和增加它的造价。但是，某些建筑师对这个问题是不考虑的。
    例如，建筑师查赫洛夫在设计中建议在莫斯科大图拉街修建外形轮廓和教堂没有什么区别的建筑物。当时大家要他解释，说明这样做的根据是什么，他回答说：“为了使我们的设计和高层建筑相配合，必须要显示这些建筑物的立体轮廓。”显而易见，原来查赫洛夫同志最感兴趣的就是这些问题。他需要美丽的轮廓线，但是人们却需要住房，他们不欣赏这些立体轮廓，而是需要房子住！（鼓掌）在留西诺夫斯克大街的建筑物设计中，建筑师想在建筑物的角上，从第八层开始都设置雕像。在建筑物的顶层的角部削去一部分，在这些被削去的角上开窗，而建议在外墙的窗台板上设置雕像。角上开有窗子的五面墙壁的住室是很不方便的；至于居住在这个房间中的人成年成月都必须看到雕像的背部，这更不用说了。显然，住在这样的房间里是不会特别舒服的。幸亏这样的建筑物没有建成，大家都制止了查赫洛夫同志采用这样的艺术手法。
    这些东西竟称为房屋的建筑艺术造型呢！不是的，同志们，这是对建筑艺术的歪曲，它们只是糟塌材料和浪费资金。莫斯科组织所通过的关于解除查赫洛夫同志建筑艺术工作室的领导职务的决议是正确的。但是为了工作的利益，本来是应当更早地采取这个措施的。
    莫斯科在今年年初有两座大型钢筋混凝土制品工厂开工，而且已制出产品，但是我们现在只有一个已批准了的骨架预制板房屋的设计。是谁阻碍了设计工作呢？许多建筑师都有责任，但首先应负责的是弗拉索夫同志--莫斯科市的总建筑师，他是一个很好的建筑师，但是，有时候他却表现得不够坚决。
    必须大力支持和鼓励好的设计工作，特别是标准设计工作。需要考虑一下，也许要修改设计工作人员的工资制度。应该规定能够更好地刺激设计人员工作的工资制度。（鼓掌）
  设计机构和某些建筑师工作中的严重缺点，有很大一部分是因为建筑科学院和许多主要建筑师提出了一些不正确的方针而引起的。直到最近还有人提出这样的方针：
    一九四五年出版的第一期“建筑艺术”汇刊发表了建筑科学院院长--莫尔维德诺夫一篇名为“苏维埃建筑的艺术问题”的文章。文中说道：“建筑艺术是为满足人民的美的需求而服务的……要创造伟大的建筑作品就必需建造一些不受实际需要所制约的建筑体量（柱廊大门，雄伟的大厅，高塔）……我想，每一个城市，如果它想成为一个美丽的城市，没有制高构图是不行的。”
    在那本汇刊中同时登载了布宁教授的一篇题为“关于在战后的恢复建设中运用城市建设遗产的问题”的文章，他说：
    “为了美化城市就需要一些功能上没有根据的建筑物，特别是圆顶建筑物和高塔……苏联城市现在遭受到垂直线危机--市中心及其公共建筑，高塔及圆顶建筑物应该单独地处理，不需要任何的标准化”。
    类似这样的意见是举不胜举的。
    建筑界的领导人物经常只强调艺术问题而很少谈到居住房屋及其他建筑物的经济及舒适问题。显然，我们要和这种建筑艺术脱离建筑中重要问题的现象进行斗争。
    有些建筑师企图以进行反对结构主义斗争的必要性为借口，来为自己不正确的方针和设计中的浪费现象辩护。但是在反对结构主义的旗帜下却浪费国家的资金。
    什么叫做结构主义？正如苏联大百科全书所指出的：“结构主义以‘表现结构’（因此称为结构主义），以单纯的技术主义代替艺术创作。结构主义者提出功能上、结构上的‘适合性’、‘合理性’的要求，而实际上却走向脱离内容的形式美的欣赏。……结果，就出现了作为最新资产阶级建筑艺术特征的那种反艺术的、颓废的‘方盒子风格’。结构主义的表现曾经在许多党的指示和决议中遭受了尖锐的批判……”（苏联大百科全书，一九五三年，第二十二卷四百三十七页）。
    这个定义当然还不是详尽无遗的。可是从上面所引的结构主义的特征，就已看出某些建筑师的无能为力的情形，这些建筑师用和结构主义做斗争的词藻来掩饰自己，实际上是去迎合立面，也就是说去迎合形式，牺牲房屋内部规划和使用的便利舒适，并且忽视人们的迫切需要。
    个别的主张必须同结构主义做斗争的建筑师走上了另一个极端--用过分的有时是完全不必要的、只是浪费国家资金的装饰物，去装饰房屋的立面。
    没有尖塔楼、上层附加建筑物、柱廊的房屋或者立面没有用虚假饰物装饰的房屋，就被称为方盒子，并断定为结构主义的再犯。也许我们可以反过来把这些建筑师称为结构主义者呢，因为他们自己滚向“脱离内容的形式美的欣赏”。
    许多建筑师以和结构主义作斗争以及建筑中的社会主义现实主义的词藻为掩饰，随便浪费人民财富，这种现象不能再容忍它存在了。
    和结构主义作斗争应该运用合理的手段。不能迷恋于建筑装饰、美术装璜、在房屋上建造毫无根据的塔楼或安置雕像，我们不反对美，可是反对铺张浪费。房屋的立面应该有美丽的和吸引人的外观，这就要靠整个建筑、门窗有良好的比例，阳台能巧妙地安排，正确地使用饰面材料的特点和颜色，在大型砌块和大型预制板的建筑中真实地显露墙壁的配件和结构。
    编制每个设计时都应该考虑节省建设资金的消耗。房屋应该是坚固的，在使用中的费用也是经济的。建筑师应当学会重视人民的金钱，这个问题是非常重要的。我的话会触到建筑师们的痛处。我就是为了这个才来讲话的，而三言两语是不解决问题的。大家讲交情、一团和气，而就在这种情况下却浪费着人民的资金--这是不好的无原则的友谊，应当和那些增强社会主义国家力量的人们去讲交情，应当赞助的是那些为人民利益而工作的人们。
    同志们！应该说，在建筑师中间，其中包括在建筑科学院中，有很多同志是积极反对某些建筑师的不正确的方针的，可是他们的反对意见没有受到重视。您，莫尔德维诺夫同志，和您的亲近的人们压制了反对建筑艺术中过分装饰和虚假装璜的呼声。（鼓掌）
    在这次会议上，大家以极大的兴趣听了建筑师格拉多夫同志的内容丰富的发言。谈到苏联建筑艺术的任务时，格拉多夫同志和其他一些同志完全正确地指出克服建筑艺术中形式主义的歪曲和因循习气的必要性。他们谈到关于批判地运用古典遗产的必要性，关于建筑应该服从于我们社会的迫切需要的问题，而为此应当更紧密地把建筑艺术与现代技术和建筑工程在所有环节上联系起来，广泛地开展建筑艺术中的主动创造和革新，并消灭任何垄断主义和压制批评的现象。对这些结论和建议我们是不能不同意的。
    在这次会议的准备时期中，格拉多夫同志给党中央写了一封信，上面陈述了自己对于建筑艺术问题方面的批评性的意见。莫尔德维诺夫同志是怎样对待这个批评的呢？他预先采取一切手段不让格拉多夫同志有可能在这次会议上发言。这个事实证明：在建筑科学院中，没有为自由交换关于创作问题的意见，为开展批评创造环境。
    还必须指出：国家建设委员会对建筑科学院的工作领导不强，很少注意标准设计工作的情况，很少注意城市规划和建筑工作的情况。
    遗憾的是，某些建筑师对于设计的不正确看法和在房屋建筑艺术造型中的铺张浪费现象还是很普遍的。
    关于这方面，我想谈谈我们在访问斯维尔德洛夫斯克城以后所获得的印象，斯维尔德洛夫斯克是一个很好的大城市，在这个城市中你可以看到苏联的强大。那里有出产很好的机器的大工厂。可是在这个大中心城市的城市建设和福利设施中却存在着很多混乱现象，例如，在改建市执行委员会的房屋时，在正立面上造了塔楼和尖顶。仅仅建造一个尖顶就几乎花费了二百万卢布，而改建整个房屋用了九百万卢布。大概，这些花费的大部分，是用在使房屋立面适应于房屋的高层部分的工程以及建造塔楼的工程的。仅仅用于建造尖顶所消耗的资金就可以建成两座各容四百名学生的学校。
    在斯维尔德洛夫斯克的一条街上，有一座五层的大建筑物。
    “这是面粉厂，”州委书记库蒂列夫同志向我们解释，并马上补充说，“可是我们想建造新面粉厂，而这座房屋就打算改建成旅馆。”
    “怎么改建？”我们问他。
    “这样，”库蒂列夫同志肯定道，“我们想把面粉厂改建成旅馆。”
    “为什么要把面粉厂改建成旅馆，”我们对他讲。“盖一个新的不好吗？”
    请诸位自己判断一下吧。难道说把做面粉厂用的房屋改建成旅馆，而重新再盖一座面粉厂是合理的吗？（会场上响起笑声。鼓掌）要知道用这些钱可以建造好的新的旅馆，并且这会更好和更便宜。常识到哪儿去了？经济合理性到哪儿去了？
    我们继续在斯维尔德洛夫斯克城内走着。州委书记说：
    “这条路我们也想把它改造一下。”
    “那你们打算怎么搞呢？”
    “铺上沥青。”
    而路面是用花岗石块铺的。要知道这样的路面能使用到我们的孙子一辈，而沥青路面过不了十年就会不中用的。请问，为什么要毁掉花岗石路面？
    当我们走到州党委会的房屋时，州委书记说：
    “这就是我们州委会的房子，我们想改建它。”
    “怎么改建？为了什么？”
    “不喜欢这立面，应当把它整个改造一番。”
    改建意味着什么呢？改造六层的房屋要花费多少钱？很明显，建造新房屋要比改建旧的便宜。
    听到这些建议，使你想起那曾经嘲笑过一位省长的不朽的谢德林，这位省长把前任省长所建造的东西通通拆毁掉，原来，在我们这里的某些地方，还存在着这些被伟大俄罗斯讽刺作家谢德林所嘲笑的习气！（鼓掌）
    这种热中于改建的有害癖性，要使国家花掉很多钱。这只有那些对委托给他们的事业失去责任心的工作者才能干得出来。我和布尔加宁同志及米高扬同志警告了斯维尔德洛夫斯克的领导者，如果他们还继续那样干和进行不必要的改建的话，那么他们将要受到处分。
    在医疗和文化生活用的房屋建筑中也有很多浪费现象。一九五三年在索契建成了造船工业部的一所疗养所。这个部的工作人员和索契市苏维埃执委会主席感觉到立面过于简陋，建议改造已完工的立面。为了这个目的花了八十万卢布。要知道用这些钱可建成一幢可容纳二十户（每户二室）的居住房屋。
    我们有根据认为：各地这种浪费现象和各种昂贵的改建工程，在很多情况下，是按照建筑师的意见进行的。要知道，如果从本质上加以分析，那么，俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国部长会议建筑事务管理局在工作中也正是采取这样的路线的。一九五三年，这个管理局举行了在俄罗斯联邦的城市和工人居住区中所建成的优秀建筑物的竞赛。哪些建筑物得了奖呢？
    在莫斯科州瓦图琴卡工人居住区盖了一座幼儿园。由于扩大各种尺度的结果，每一名额所占的房屋体积达九十一点九立方公尺，而定额是二十四立方公尺。建筑物充满了各种塑造的装饰。外部建筑艺术带有“宫殿”性质。花费在这座建筑物上的资金可以盖三座幼儿园。而这个设计的作者却得了第一奖。因为什么呢？因为浪费资金。（笑声）
    在乌发城按标准设计盖了一座电影院。房屋的立面又重新设计过，用了很多昂贵的装饰物。装饰工程的造价占总造价百分之三十以上。设计的作者同样得了第一奖。
    雅尔塔城第六十六号疗养院的外科大楼中，在平面处理方面超过定额二分之一以上，而这个设计的作者却获得了奖金。
    所有这些事实都说明：俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国部长会议建筑事务管理局给建筑师们的工作指出了不正确的方向，不关心建筑的经济问题。
    你们可能会问，那么谁是这个竞赛的评判委员会主席呢？担任这个职务的是切尔尼雪夫同志--苏联建筑师协会的书记，以前曾任莫斯科市的总建筑师。很遗憾，这样有经验的建筑师却让自己离开了正确的道路。或许，撤销这个不正确的评判决定是有好处的。（鼓掌）
    在这次会议之后，应当在城市中和各部中举行建筑师、结构工程师和生产、建筑工作人员的会议，让人们“推心置腹”地谈谈，并得出一致的看法。我相信，大多数建筑师一定能正确地理解我们的要求。（鼓掌）谁不能理解，就应该去纠正他。
    在这里发过言的维施涅夫斯基同志提出了建议--根据每平方公尺居住面积的造价批准“出厂价格”，并按区和城市规定房屋建筑的造价。可能，这样会有助于克服设计中的浪费现象。我想这个建议是正确的。
    应当消除城市设计和规划中的严重缺点。我们的党组织，苏维埃机关应该经常研究这个重要工作。上面列举的建筑师工作中的缺点的原因之一，就是他们在很多情况下感觉不到地方党和苏维埃组织的监督和帮助。应该提高地方机关对城市和村镇的建设及福利设施工作的责任心。
    直到最近，苏联城市规划的设计是要经联盟政府批准的。在这种情况下，设计的批准就要拖延很长的时间。特别是可以举出这样一个例子：战后基辅编制了市中心的建筑设计。这个设计由基辅到莫斯科往返搬运了很多次。克列沙其克街几乎已经建成，可是设计还没有批准。而这并不是个别的情况。我们认为很有必要授予地方机关更多的权利，重新考虑城市建筑设计的批准程序。（鼓掌）必须估计到地方干部已经成长，在正确的组织工作之下，他们一定能熟练地解决这些问题的。这样处理问题将提高地方领导人员的责任心，并发挥其主动性。
    另一方面，显然，要求国家建设委员会加强对地方上所进行的这些工作的监督，以便使我们这里不再产生类似我们在斯维尔德洛夫斯克所见到的那种混乱现象，是恰当的。
    如果我们能认真地组织标准设计，坚决地改善建筑师和结构工程师的工作，注意经济问题，提高我们地方机关的责任心，更多地发挥他们的主动性，那么，我们一定能在建筑事业中，在降低工程造价和提高质量上获得新的巨大的成就。
    提高质量是建筑工作者的最重要的任务
    同志们！提高建筑质量的问题，值得特别注意。我们不仅应该建设得快，而且还必须要好，要坚固。我们应该珍重自己的建筑工作者的称号。房屋应当便于居住和便于使用。建造得不好的房屋每隔很短的时间就需要修理，因而必须增加资金消耗。所有各项建筑都是这样。
    首先我想谈一下关于居住房屋建筑的质量问题。房屋的墙和楼板，我们砌筑得坚固吗？我认为是非常坚固的。在居住房屋、学校、旅馆和其他建筑物中，墙和楼板建造得可以经受一百年。这是不容置疑的，因为在建筑中广泛地采用了钢筋混凝土。但是应该直截了当地说，房屋的装饰工程常常搞得不好。不仅如此，许多工作人员竟容忍了房屋装饰方面显然是马虎的、糟糕的工作。关于这一点会议上很多同志所讲过的是完全正确的。
    不久以前，我和布尔加宁同志、米高扬同志曾经到过远东、西伯利亚和乌拉尔地区的很多城市。我们被招待得很好。这是可以理解的：客人是要求严格的人，可能还要批评，甚至还不只是批评。因此他们力求招待得好一些。（笑声，鼓掌）在斯维尔德洛夫斯克城时我们住在旅馆里，这个旅馆建造得非常坚固耐久。可以想到他们是不会把我们安置在坏房间里的。（笑声）但是就在这个旅馆里，我们看见了卫生间造得非常不好，装饰工程的质量是不高的。我们把旅馆的经理和市的领导者请来，并且告诉他们说：请看，多么不好的工程！
    显然，在施工时没有必要的严格要求。面砖的质量低，而且铺得很马虎。卫生间中的管子生满了锈，大概，在我们来到之前，他们匆忙地刷上了一种灰色的油漆，同时也刷了墙。这些管子的连接处做的很不好，我过去是个钳工，所以我当时很气愤：即使在革命以前，在矿井里的管子的连接，也要比在斯维尔德洛夫斯克旅馆里的做的好和整洁。
    在库页岛我们住在军人旅馆里。旅馆的房屋很好，但是洗澡间和卫生间的装饰工程质量同样是很差。饰面砖的质量不好，并铺得很马虎。
    关于这样的事实，而这样的事实又很多，应该告诉建筑工作者，并且要求他们坚决改善工程质量。建筑材料工业部部长尤金同志和建筑材料工业部的其他工作人员不应该骄傲，应该向我们的捷克斯洛伐克的朋友们学习，他们做出了很好的建筑材料和配件。（鼓掌）在这项工作里我们还可以向德意志民主共和国学习，他们生产着质量好的饰面砖。应该直截了当地说，有一些同志很少向别人学习，而主要的是不愿意学习。（鼓掌）
    在已交工使用的居住房屋中，常常留下了很多未完成的工程，以致使居住者感到很不方便。
    必须特别注意改进细木制品的质量。很多房间的门窗都做的不好。可是你们知道，当一个人进屋时，他首先就会注意到门：它关起来时怎么样；有没有缝；漆的怎么样，同样他还会看到窗户做的怎样，窗上的铁活好不好。我们应该顽强地、不断地为提高装饰工程质量而斗争。在居住房屋中，同样还应该很好地装饰楼梯间。
    对于改善居住房屋的隔音质量的问题，还要做很多工作，特别是应该研究住户之间的隔音问题。这个问题应处理的很完善。住户之间的间隔墙和楼层之间的楼板应该满足隔音的要求。
    在铺装地板的工程中存在很多缺点。拼花地板铺放在玛?脂上，但是采用的玛?脂的质量常常是不能令人满意的，它常从拼花地板之下冒出来。拼花地板也拼得不好，应该改善铺装拼花地板的工程质量。
    应该更广泛地发展漆布的生产。用漆布铺装的地板，并不次于拼花地板，它更合乎卫生，更华丽，对这种地板的保养也比对拼花地板简单。大家知道，拼花地板必须要打蜡，这个工作很复杂，而且要增加开支。我们应该珍惜妇女的劳动，并要尽可能地减轻妇女的劳动。
    在很多情况下，厨房的家具也做的质量低劣。这并不是因为我们不会做的更好，而是对质量的要求不严格：采用湿的木材，油漆涂得不好，必须纠正这些缺点。同时还应该更广泛地扩大学校、医院、住宅用的良好家具的生产。
    陶质面砖是作为建筑物外墙装饰用的最好的材料。陶质饰面材料经久、美观并在使用期中不变色，半干压制用压榨机设计者梅里亚同志出席了这次会议，并谈到了关于压榨机的工作，这种压榨机已经给我们做出了不同尺寸和不同颜色而又便宜的陶制品。必须使建筑师熟悉这些材料，并且要和梅里亚同志一起从事新型陶质饰面材料的创造工作。
    提高工程质量的任务，使我们有必要更严格地要求建筑材料工业部、制造建筑材料的企业的领导者。有了质量好的材料就能为减低工程造价和提高建筑质量创造条件。
    在城市中对建筑没有进行有效的监督，这在很多情况下造成了工程质量低劣的情况。因而应该提出关于改善国家建筑监督机构的工作的问题。关于这点发表了各种不同的看法。同志们提出给予国家建筑监督机构的工作人员以下列权利：停止工程的进行；严格处罚不好的建筑工程的负责人；提高对工程质量的责任感等等。显然，应该研究这些建议，并且规定各种措施来影响坏的建筑工作者，应该对建筑工作者加强监督和提高对他们的要求，以便在今后能建筑得坚固、建筑得好。我想这点我们一定能做到。
    提高每项建筑工程的质量，--无论是工业建筑、居住房屋建筑或是任何其他建筑--这是一件有着巨大的国家意义的事情。无论是建筑工作者本身--从各部的领导者起，以至每一个工人，--无论是各地方党、苏维埃、职工会、共青团的组织都应当关心建筑工程的优良质量。在这样经常的和群众的监督之下，建筑工程的质量将会提高到我国人民所要求的高度水平。
    关于建筑工程的计划和经济的若干问题
    在会上许多发言者都谈到了建筑工程计划工作中的严重缺点，谈到了资金分散地使用在许多工程项目上，工期的拖延以及建筑材料的不能充分供应，因而使工程造价提高。
    将资金分散使用在许多工程项目上会造成很大损失。我想举出几个“已经长了胡子的”工程来补充会议上已经提过的那些工程。交通部从一九四○年就开始修建由阿斯基兹到阿巴扎的铁路。该项工程的造价是七千四百万卢布。在十三年内用去了全部资金的百分之六十四。一九五五年计划是五百万卢布。如按这样的建筑工程计划，这条线路的工程将继续十九年。
    内河航运部从一九四九年就开始在雅罗斯拉夫州建设造船厂。建筑工程造价约五千万卢布，在五年内已用去了约一千万卢布。一九五五年该项建筑计划是三百万卢布。如用这种速度来建设，该项工程总共将继续约二十年。难道可以这样缓慢地建设和不以主人翁的态度来花钱吗？同志们，必须根除这些现象！
    如果这些工程需要的话，那么我们就在比较短的时期内把它完成，而不应把工程拖几十年。
    请允许我读一下正在建设的灯泡工厂的领导者斯克利甫金和涅斯切洛夫两同志，以及第十三工程公司计划科科长布留姆同志写给苏联共产党中央委员会的一封信。他们是这样写的：
    “第十三工程公司在很多年内，在十个巨大工程上进行着工作。而每项工程造价是数千万卢布。每年，其中包括一九五四年，每项工程中都计划了十一个到四十个工程项目。在一百多个工程项目上同时进行施工，而公司一共只有九百个工人。在每一工程项目上平均有十人到十五人。某些工程项目还是很大的生产厂房、锅炉房及居住房屋。
    这样分散的原因，就是身为发包人的各部，没有考虑建筑机构的可能性，而在年度计划中列入了大量的工程项目和资金。
    有已批准的工程项目一览表并在拨款上有保证的那些工厂，就都坚持要求在全部工程项目上进行施工。这些要求可由各部的电报及命令来证实。因此建筑机构不得不随机应便，同时在所有的工程项目上进行施工，轮流地，时而赶建这个工厂，时而赶建那个工厂。因此计划中的大多数工程项目不能交工使用，因而拖延了工厂的开工生产。
    在许多工程项目上同时进行同一种工程的施工就会造成困难。因此，远在一九五一年已开工的大多数工厂，本来可以在两年之内完工，但都要建造五年到七年。花费在建筑上的资金是呆滞的资本。由于不能及时交出生产场地，而放在发包人仓库中的设备也几年安装不起来，这就使大量资金变成了设备储备而冻结了。材料供应方面的紧张情况使得劳动力和机械的使用情况恶化了，工程质量降低了。
    必须制止同时对许多大工厂进行建筑安装工程施工的计划工作。苏联国家计划委员会必须遵照把拨出的资金集中使用的原则，而不是遵照把它分散到很多工程上的原则，有计划地按发包部和承包部来分配建筑工程任务。”
    这封信中所写的带有批评性的意见和写信者本人的结论都是完全正确的。信里所谈到的缺点，在许多城市和许多部里都存在着。必须制止类似的把资金分散到各工程项目上的现象。
    怎样对这些缺点进行斗争呢？反对分散资金的斗争首先应该由部长和所有主管机关的领导者来进行。苏联国家计划委员会也必须对这件事予以特别注意。或许，应该在不增加人员的条件下组织检查和监督，委托工作人员来实行监督，他们不只是简单地收集一些材料，而要检查拨付建筑工程的资金利用的怎样；工程项目一览表编制的是否正确；是否有损害国家利益的现象。
    最主要的是必须严格遵守制度：没有设计，没有预算，没有施工图就不能开工。（鼓掌）而目前实际情况又是怎样呢？刚通过进行建筑的决议，“开始施工”的报告已经飞来了，而实际上连设计文件都没有呢。大家知道，在开始施工之前应很好地平整场地，修筑道路，保证水和动力的供应，应该有完备的设计。应该由谁来监督遵守这种制度呢？国家计划委员会。但只是国家计划委员会也是困难的，发包部的部长和承包部的部长也应该作这项工作。
    计划建筑工程时，必须考虑到建筑机构和建筑工业的生产实力、可能性和要求。除非有设计文件，才能拨给基本建设的资金。各部、各主管机关，以及国家计划委员会应该改善建筑工程的计划工作。
    我们在计划及供应部门工作的一些同志，有时忘记了这一点：在他们的计算中即使有一点不准确的地方也可能使国家损失几百万卢布。
    我们在这方面损失很大，即工地所得到的金属和其他材料并不常常都是合乎需要的品种。我现在举两个例子，而类似的例子建筑工作者可以举不胜举。建筑工作者需要在钢筋混凝土中用直径为五公厘半的钢丝。但没有这种钢丝，于是他们就对建筑工作者说：你们就用比它粗一公厘的，直径为六公厘半粗的钢丝罢。似乎相差无几--总共才一公厘，难道还值得为这点事争吵吗？因此，一九五三年仅在建造部的部分工程中，这一公厘就多耗费了四千八百吨金属。这已经是很大的数字，国家计划委员会为它进行斗争是完全正确的。同志们，这一公厘花费可不少啊！
    在石油管道建筑工程总局的工程中，设计是规定采用薄壁石油管。实际上，工业供给的管道是厚壁的。因此，在一九五三年仅该局浪费的金属就有三千四百吨，这就使工程造价增加了三百二十六万卢布。
    显然，类似的浪费金属及其他建筑材料的现象是不应该有的。
    应该指出，各部、各主管机关、国家建设委员会、国家计划委员会以及财政部对建筑工程的经济问题研究得不够。
    在本会议上发言的依奥纳斯同志和其他同志说过，目前建筑中存在着预算失去本来意义的情况。因而实际上就形成了竣工工程的预算造价越高，则完成计划的指标越好，工资总额和间接费用也越大。建筑工作者争取完成昂贵的工程，已不是偶然的了。
    近年来建筑技术，建筑工程的机械化，劳动组织，建筑材料和结构都大大改变了。但拨款制度、建筑工程定额，以及与建筑机构的承包业务活动有关的各种规程和指示都还和一九三六年、一九三八年一样。所有这些都阻碍着建筑事业的发展。显然，应该像在一九三五年全苏建筑工作者会议以后那样，制订和采取整顿建筑工程拨款的措施。
    对建筑工程计划和经济的问题，应经常而深入地进行研究。应该使建筑工作者自己经常地对建筑工程进行经济分析，提出改进计划工作的具体建议。此外，应该委托一批不属于各部和主管机关的工作人员，或许委托国家银行的人（会场活跃）系统地研究建筑工程经济问题。同志们，为什么你们中间有些人不喜欢银行呢？大概某些人不喜欢银行，是因为这个机关是算钱的机关，而某些人希望不算就可以得到钱。但是，这是办不到的。
  （鼓掌）
    提高劳动生产率，培养熟练的建筑工作干部
    关于进一步提高建筑部门劳动生产率的问题具有极重要的意义。为保证劳动生产率的不断上升，首先应当在工地上正确地组织工作，更好地使用劳动力和机械，节省原材料，培养固定的技术熟练的建筑工作干部。劳动生产率的提高，就会增加建筑工作者的工资，改善他们的物质生活福利。
    在大会上发言的某些同志提出了关于增加建筑工作者工资的问题，我收到的条子上也谈到了这个问题。因此，需要作某些解释。大家知道，我们总是把增加工资和提高劳动生产率联系起来看的。劳动生产率的提高应当超过工资的增长，只有在这样条件下，我们的社会才能经常得到为扩大生产和在扩大生产的基础上提高人民的物质福利所必需的社会主义资金的积累。这是唯一正确的道路，因为我们提高劳动人民的物质福利，只有在全部国民经济高涨的基础上才能达到。每个人都应了解，在我们国家里，在流通过程中及居民手中的现有商品和现金之间，应当保持一个正确的比例关系。只有这样，我们的货币才是稳定的，我们的卢布才是巩固的和有价值的。只有这样，实际工资才能逐渐增加。否则是行不通的。
    因此，为了增加劳动人民的实际工资，就必须保证劳动生产率的不断提高和每个工人产值的不断增长。
    我们提高劳动生产率的情形怎样呢？
    根据第十九次党代表大会的指示，在第五个五年计划中规定，工业部门劳动生产率的提高约为百分之五十，建筑部门为百分之五十五，并相应提高实际工资不少于百分之三十五。
    四年之内，工业部门劳动生产率已提高了百分之三十三，建筑部门提高了百分之三十二。在此期内实际工资增加了百分之三十七，即已经超过了整个五年计划所规定的水平。也就是说，现在我们的工资总数已有很大的超支了。这些材料说明在工业和建筑部门中，在运用技术和组织劳动方面还存在着严重的缺点。许多机关、企业和建筑机构的领导者没有完成提高劳动生产率的计划，而采用着增加职工人数的办法，以致使工资总数超支了。
    大家很清楚地知道，在建筑部门中存在着提高劳动生产率从而提高工资的巨大潜力。这就是建筑工程的机械化，正确使用装备我们工地的强大技术设备；这就是过渡到工业化的施工方法；这就是提高工人的技术，更好地采用革新者的先进经验并加强劳动纪律。
    很多例子都令人信服地说明了在提高劳动生产率和增加工资方面存在着多么大的潜力。我只举出一九五四年莫斯科建成的很多学校建筑中的两个学校来比较：一个是在陶克玛可夫巷用砖墙结构建筑的，另一个是在库图佐夫居民区用大型砌块建成的。请看，在建筑的劳动消耗量方面有多大的差别。砌砖墙，建造屋檐、楼板、楼梯和间隔墙花了七千三百六十个工，而用大型砌块建筑的学校在同样工程上仅用了一千七百八十个工，或共用工数只等于用砖建筑的学校所用工数的百分之二十四。用砖建筑的学校砌砖工程的工人平均产值每个工为二百六十八卢布，而用大型砌块的建筑则为一千四百三十二卢布，即多四·三倍。如将所有工程都考虑在内，则采用砖墙结构的学校每个工的产值为一百四十二卢布，而第二个学校则为二百六十一卢布，即多○·八倍。塔式起重机的使用情况：第一个学校的工程用了三百一十四个台班，而第二个学校只用了一百六十四个台班或为前者的百分之五十二。同志们，提高劳动生产率和增加工资的潜力就在这里！
    提高劳动生产率的最重要条件之一，就是工人的专业化和他们的技术水平的提高。这个问题和培养固定工人干部的任务是密切相关的。工地上劳动力流动性之大已达到不能容忍的程度。这是因为在很多工地上并没有认真组织新工人的训练工作。一个集体农庄庄员来到工地上，没有任何技术，像大家所知道的一样，把他算做杂工。一个人就这样打杂，他的产值很低，没有专业，而且工资也不高。他开始观望起来了。正在这个时候来了一些同志，告诉他：我跟你说，扔掉这个工作到工厂去，在那儿再过半年你就有技术了，便会评入等级，可能还会弄到房子住。他考虑再三，最后走了。再过半年，他在工厂中学到了技术，他得到的工资比在建筑工地上多一两倍。对吧？（座位上喊出：对呀！）挖土机手、汽车司机、混凝土工、吊装工、瓦工--这些熟练工人是不会离开工地的。他们有技术，干自己专业的工作，能完成生产定额而且所得的报酬也不坏。
    如果能够很好地帮助每一个建筑工作者掌握某一种专业，帮助他成为能够使用高效率技术设备的熟练工人，那么他就会热爱自己的工作，并且会骄傲地宣布：“我是建筑工作者！”遗憾的是，在我们的工地上，还很少关怀新工人。苏联已经没有失业现象。对于工人来说，找工作是没有任何困难的。要使工人在工地上固定下来，就必须训练他们，帮助他们掌握某一个工种的技术。
    同志们，除此以外，毫无疑义，我们应该更多地注意调整工资的问题。差不多在每一个部门都应用着很多的工资等级表，难道这是正常的吗？关于这个问题，许多发言人已经正确地谈到了。关于调整在不同部门工作的建筑工作者工资的建议，应当予以支持。在同一城市中，同一专业和具有相等技术水平的建筑工作者，只是因为他们在不同部门的工地上工作，这些部门各有不同的单价，而得到了不同的工资，这种不正常的现象应当消灭。很明显，这个问题的产生，是因为有很多经济工作者违反了以前估计到每个地区特点而制定的工资制度，违反了所谓地区工资制度。应当说，在这个问题上，就连工会也没有表现出应有的积极性。
    各经营单位和工会组织必须正确地利用本单位具有的物质潜力，以鼓励工地上劳动生产率的提高和每个工人产值的增加。这样，就能保证我们建设事业的强大高涨，实际工资的增加，建筑工作者的生活水平、物质和文化福利的不断提高。
    不培养中级和高级的专业人材，就不可能顺利解决培养固定的、熟练的建筑工作干部的问题。在培养专业人材方面，我们现在比过去具有无可比拟的更优越的条件。所有建筑工人群众的普通教育水平都大大提高了。从工人中间选拔了优秀的组织者，成长了掌握工业化施工方法的专家。很多有先进技术装备的工地，可以而且应该成为培养施工专家的良好学校。
    现在，我们国家有许多刚从十年制学校毕业的年轻人，不上大学而参加了生产。这是正常的也是极其自然的现象。应该为这些青年建立训练班，教给他们技术，从他们中间培养出中级专业干部，而且我认为甚至可以培养出高级专业干部。
    我们应该认真地研究改善不脱离生产培养专业干部的工作，应当更多地注意扩充和改善中级和高级函授学校和夜校的工作。这个工作会给整个国民经济带来很大的好处。如果高等教育部现在分析一下，有多少大学生进入高等学校的一年级，又有多少人在大学毕业，那末，就可以看出高等学校里有很多被淘汰的。此外，还远不是所有的大学毕业生都做自己专业的工作。如果可以这样说的话，那就是某些高等学校的效率是不够高的。
    另一方面，设于大工厂的高级和中级学校或是它们的分校，同样培养具有高度技术的专业干部，而且，这些干部是不脱离生产学习的，并且继续在自己的企业里工作。例如，斯大林汽车工厂就有自己的学院。在这里有很多工人不脱离生产地学习。这里有许多工人变成了优秀的大学生。工人进入工厂之后，就爱上了自己的企业和自己的职业。他们具备中等教育程度以后，就高兴地到夜校、技术学校或夜大学去学习，在那里毕业了，得到了技术员或工程师的称号，仍然继续在这个工厂里工作。而区别就在于，开始学习的时候是普通的工人或工长，当毕业以后，就可以成为工长、技术员或工程师，有的成为车间主任了。
    我们认为，在改善现有中等和高等学校培养专业人材工作的同时，还应该更广泛地开展从实际工作者中培养专家的工作，这些实际工作者就是工地上的工程技术干部和工段、工地上的领导人员。应该采取脱离生产或不脱离生产的方法组织这一类工作人员的培养工作。不脱离生产培养专家需要的时间长一些，但是这个方法有它本身的优点。因为不脱离生产培养出来的大学毕业生，对业务了解的深刻，有丰富的实践经验。很多科学知识和生产知识丰富的、由于经验而变得聪明的工程师，通过最后一次考试合格以后，就可以大胆地来管理企业。（鼓掌）正规大学的毕业生，照例有很好的知识，但是他们需要有一定的时间学习生产，积累必要的实际经验。
    进一步改善我国建筑工作和工业化施工的任务，在党的、经济的、工会和共青团的组织面前，提出了彻底改善建筑工作干部方面全部工作的要求。建筑工作者从事对国家极关重要的事业。我们的责任就是对他们做到无微不至的关怀和照顾。这就是要更深刻地注意和充分地满足他们的日益增长的需求，改善他们的居住条件和生活条件，更好地组织群众性的政治工作和文化教育工作，以及在建筑工作者中间广泛开展争取完成和超额完成计划、提高劳动生产率的社会主义竞赛。
    关于道路建筑和农村建筑的几点意见
    同志们！请允许我对道路建筑和农村建筑方面提出几点意见。在这里，没有必要再来谈论好的道路对于我们土地辽阔的国家是多么重要。
    我们应该发展水泥混凝土的道路，这是最好的道路。（鼓掌）沥青路--这种道路可以使用十年，而水泥混凝土路--可使用一百年。我们的方向应该是发展水泥工业，以便铺筑混凝土道路。俗话说，我们还没阔气到这种地步，尽建筑些便宜而不坚固的东西。价高的道路，意味着结实、坚固，应当建筑这样的路，使人忘记它是什么时候修筑起来的！（鼓掌）
    必须在集体农庄、国营农场、机器拖拉机站进行建筑生产房舍、居住房屋和谷仓的巨大工作，在这些工程上，我们也应当广泛采用装配式钢筋混凝土，并尽可能采用砌块来建筑。例如，在机器拖拉机站可进行砌块以及骨架建筑。这样，就应广泛应用地方建筑材料。砌块可用贝壳石灰岩、石灰岩、砖和土坯做成。应该使一切地方资源和材料服务于建设。
    很遗憾，在应用地方建筑材料方面提出的建议很少。芦苇对于农村建筑是很好的一种材料。在乌克兰及其他共和国的很多地区，自古以来，就用芦苇盖房子，这是一种奇异的材料：不腐烂，有良好的隔热性能。然而，对它的利用还不够。骨架建筑物的墙壁、间隔墙和楼板用的“斯特罗密特”型的板材应当用刨花、麦秸和芦苇制作，应制作芦苇板和麦秸板。
    今年春天，阿司特拉罕州党委会书记卡涅柯同志向我请求增加该州木材的供应。大家都知道，那里没有木材。同样，大家也知道，我们必须把木材用于更重要的建筑上。
    当时我告诉卡涅柯同志说：
    “在你们州里生长着极好的芦苇，这是金子，还不是建筑材料么！”
    “是的，我们那儿有芦苇。”
    “难道连羊圈都不能用芦苇盖吗？要知道找不到比芦苇更好的材料来盖羊圈了。”
    卡涅柯同志同意了这点，虽然从这次谈话后，已经过去了很多时间，而事情并没有显著的进展。
    在哈萨克斯坦生长着极多的芦苇--占全国芦苇的百分之七十。在视察哈萨克斯坦垦荒地区的沿途中，曾与共和国的领导者们讨论过利用芦苇的问题。波诺马连柯、布列日涅夫、达别阔夫及哈萨克斯坦的其他领导同志找到了懂得生产芦苇板的专家，并开始在农业建筑中采用芦苇。
    在乌兹别克斯坦、土库曼和乌克兰的第涅斯特尔大芦苇丛、布克、多瑙河等地都有很多的芦苇。用芦苇可建造各种农业房舍，甚至居住房屋，可制作优美的物品，然而到目前为止，芦苇并没有很好地利用，对于这个问题必须予以重视！
    在农村建筑中，应广泛采用极多的、各种各样的地方建筑材料，在骨架式的房屋建筑中，可以采用各种地方材料做填充物，在莫斯科哈赫罗夫斯基木材加工工厂有制作麦秸板和刨花板的简单设备，正如实际经验所证明的，用这种板材建筑的夹壁墙防寒性能很好。应该制造这种设备，并为农村建筑组织麦秸板和刨花板的生产。
    应该严重地注意集体农庄房屋的建筑以及村镇、农村、中亚细亚和高加索山村福利设施的建筑工作。过去当人们贫困的时候，他们不可能用优美的住宅来美化自己的生活，现在情况变了，先进的集体农庄，由于自己农庄经济的高涨有了大量收入，每一个集体农庄庄员的每个劳动日都有很高的工资收入。然而，许多集体农庄庄员的居住房屋看起来是令人不愉快的。
    应该建筑符合于集体农庄庄员日益增长的文化需求的居住房屋。目前，很多集体农庄和集体农庄庄员们有建筑新房屋的资金，而他们不能买到所需的建筑材料，因为这种材料的生产是不敷应用的。
    同志们，让我们考虑一下，怎样来改变这种情况。让那些有可能建筑的集体农庄和集体农庄庄员们，尽可能多地建造生产房舍。文化生活建筑和居住房屋，并把它们建筑得尽可能地美好。应该提醒人们，让他们建筑吧，并且要协助他们建筑。（鼓掌）为使农村建筑顺利地进行，也需要做好农村建筑所需建筑材料的生产工作。
    为此目的，各共和国和各州级机关必须发展本地区的建筑材料工业。这种地方工业不仅限于砖的生产，而主要地是以水泥的生产为基础。应使全苏和各共和国的机关都来建设水泥厂。到那时，国家才有大量的水泥用以满足农村建筑的需要。
    在我国，正进行着扩大生产人民生活必需品的巨大工作，很多人只把这一类的物品，像皮靴、服装、皮大衣及其他的家庭生活日用品叫做人民生活必需品。难道居住房屋建筑所用的建筑材料就不是人民生活必需品吗？居住房屋建筑所需之建筑材料，同样地，也是人民极不可缺少的生活必需品。
    应该全面地发展水泥、石板瓦、瓦及其他建筑材料的生产，以便卖给农村。应当广泛生产用于集体农庄、村镇和城郊的农业建筑和少层房屋等各种建筑上的装配式结构和配件，卖给劳动人民。这种做法，既利于国家，又利于居民。
    提高建筑材料的生产，并把它们推广到农村去，我们便能大大加快我们农村和村镇的改造，并将使它们变成美丽的、悦目的、美化人们生活的地方。（鼓掌）
    最后，要谈一谈电影院的建筑。在城市，特别是在农村，电影院还是不够的，需要建筑更多的电影院，更多地摄制质量好的电影片。这对于人民文化的继续高涨和苏联人民的精神生活，是一件不可缺少的重大工作。

    同志们！苏维埃国家的威力在一年一年地增长。我国国民经济的迅速发展，人民的福利和文化水平的不断提高，完全是共产党正确的列宁政策的结果。我们的一切成就，就是苏联人民团结一致的明证，就是苏联人民忠实于共产主义事业的明证。
    在伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利后的三十七年，我国从沙皇制度下那样一个落后的国家变成了先进的强大的社会主义强国。我国人民获得的历史性的胜利可以说是震撼了全世界，这是苏维埃制度的极大优越性所产生的结果。
    伟大的列宁创立了我们共产党，在革命斗争中锻炼了这个党，引导它走向了伟大的共产主义建设事业。而全国人民都跟随着我们的党。现在，全世界都承认苏联的威力，承认它是世界上伟大的强国，甚至连帝国主义者们也不得不承认这一点。这一点是苏联人民在久经考验了的共产党的领导下达到的。这就是体现了马克思-恩格斯-列宁-斯大林的思想的结果。（暴风雨般的长时间的鼓掌）
    在我们已获得成绩的基础上，今后还是尽一切力量来发展重工业的同时，我们将不断地巩固我们祖国的威力，为进一步发展国民经济，为提高人民的福利而斗争。在这个伟大的创造性的共产主义建设事业当中，人数众多的建筑工作者大军有着巨大的作用。
    同志们！我们这个会议进行得很成功，提出了许多正确的建议。这些建议都是很有意义，都有很大的价值，苏联各地区的成千成万的建筑工作者都会熟习这些建议和已有的宝贵经验。会议证明，我们的建筑工作者都很了解摆在他们面前的任务。他们都有一个强烈的愿望，愿意改善工业企业的建筑工作，以便不断地巩固苏维埃国家的工业威力，给祖国建设更多的质量好的居住房屋和其他的建筑物。
    如果我们把会议上所谈到的宝贵经验总结起来，并且认真地实现这些建议，采用各种先进的方法，如果我们为彻底消灭各种缺点而进行坚决斗争的话，那么我们就能够节约大量的资金和材料，就能大大地加速资金的周转，就能加速建筑工程的进度，并改进其质量。
    必须责成国家建设委员会主席索科洛夫同志，责成各部部长，特别是各建造部部长，要研究会议的全部材料和所有的发言。同时也请在会上没有来得及发言的同志提出自己的发言提纲，而这些提纲也是必须考虑到的。总结了会议上的全部材料之后，就应当拟定一些具体的建议。这些建议可以分成三类：第一类是必须在全国范围内执行的；第二类是可以而且应当在联盟各个部内执行的；第三类是有关各加盟共和国和各州的建议。必须对这些建议的执行情况建立必要的监督。
    应当特别注意总结并推广建筑中的各种先进的方法。（鼓掌）
    如果能够在各地区和某些部内也召开这样的会议是很好的。在这些会议上应当总结先进经验，特别是要总结在工业化施工方面的先进经验，并且在这些会议上要批评我们的一切缺点，就像一般所说的“用金刚砂擦去污秽”一样，而不要害怕触动自己朋友的痛处。这就能够发掘出新的巨大潜力，并使它服务于我们的共同事业。
    同志们！在结束我的发言的时候，我确信：建筑工作者、建筑师、结构工程师、建筑材料工业、建筑机械和筑路机械制造业、设计机构和科学研究机构的工作人员，一定能够光荣地完成党和政府所交给他们的任务；一定能够进一步提高我们建筑的水平、速度和质量；将会更迅速地使工厂、矿山、发电站投入生产；一定能够建造出更便宜、更坚固和更美丽的居住房屋、学校和医院。同志们！在下一次建筑工作者会议上再见，预祝你们获得新的成就！（暴风雨般的长时间的鼓掌，全体起立）
