Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 27th: According to TASS, the plenary session of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party opened on January 26th. The agenda of the meeting was: (1) On the question of opposing the revival of German militarism, preventing the heinous atomic war, and defending the demands of the working class and all working people. (2) On the question of state elections.

    Central Committee Secretary Jacques Duclos made a report on the first issue.

    Duclos said that since the 13th Party Congress, considerable achievements have been made in the struggle for peace, as evidenced by the rejection of the "European Defense Community" plan. However, the National Assembly's ratification of the Paris Agreements and the North Atlantic Council's decision on the use of atomic weapons have thwarted the nascent easing of international tensions.

    Duclos said: The great responsibility for preventing the ratification of the Paris Agreements rests on the French people, led by the working class. As patriots and advocates of proletarian internationalism, Communists are fighting side by side with all French people who recognize their national responsibility and want to prevent the revival of German militarism; they express warm solidarity with the German Communists persecuted by the Adenauer government and all working people and democrats in West Germany and the German Democratic Republic who are fighting against the establishment of a new Wehrmacht.

    Duclos said: The increasingly high tide of the French people's struggle against the Paris Agreements, which violate the interests of France and peace, makes it possible to launch a powerful people's movement to prevent the ratification of these agreements. Mass pressure must be exerted on the Senate of the Republic through the direct influence of the provincial senators, mayors, and city councilors who elect the senators of the Republic. We know that senators of the Republic from half of the French provinces will be up for re-election this year.

    Duclos went on to talk about the more serious threat of war caused by the recent decision of the North Atlantic Council to use atomic weapons. In this regard, he emphasized the unremitting efforts made by the Soviet government to oppose the threat of atomic war and safeguard world peace and collective security. Duclos said that we have a responsibility to make greater efforts to prevent atomic war. To prevent the realization of this planned crime, the people's protest movement must be strengthened.

    Duclos pointed out that the resolution of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council to launch a signature campaign to demand the destruction of all nationally stored atomic bombs and the immediate cessation of the manufacture of atomic bombs is fully in line with the aspirations of all countries. Communists have a responsibility to take the lead in the struggle against the agitators, organizers, and propagandists of atomic war.

    Duclos called on French Communists to step up their struggle to defend the interests of the people of the North African colonies who are fighting for national independence. Then he emphasized that the struggle against the threat of war is closely linked to the struggle to defend the economic demands of the workers. Duclos said that the government hopes to shift the entire burden of its militaristic policies, which it encourages and supports with the assistance of large industrialists, onto the shoulders of the working class and all working masses, and refuses to meet the legitimate demands of the working class. Duclos emphasized the urgent need to consolidate the unity of action of the working class.

    Duclos said: In France, some political and social figures and groups oppose the revival of German militarism. They have decided to fight together with the Communist Party for this purpose and to unite democratic and national forces to establish what they call a "new left-wing alliance." Naturally, the Communist Party can only welcome all these efforts aimed at uniting French men and women who hope to change the political course of our country and will not refuse the joint action necessary to achieve this goal. However, the followers of Mendès-France are trying to use the name of the "new left wing" as a cover for their reactionary policies. They are trying to use the word "left" in the upcoming elections to confuse voters and steal votes from the Communist Party. The task of the French Communists is to expose this trick of the reactionary forces by all possible means.

    Duclos concluded by saying that we are people who hold the great hope and confidence that the workers will be liberated through the victory of socialism. The struggles we wage at every stage of our path bring us closer to this goal. We must do everything we can to build the united action of the working class as a necessary condition for the unity of all national and democratic forces. We must stand at the forefront of the working class and all the people, and fight for the change of government policy that the whole nation desires and expects. We must fight for the victory of national independence and a policy of peace, for the victory of a policy of freedom and social progress in our country.

    The plenary session of the Central Committee then began to discuss Jacques Duclos' report.

    杜克洛在法共中央全会上作报告
    号召反对武装西德防止原子战争
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社巴黎二十七日讯：法国共产党中央委员会全体会议在一月二十六日开幕。会议议程是：（一）关于反对复活德国军国主义、防止罪恶的原子战争和保卫工人阶级和全体劳动人民的要求的斗争问题。（二）关于州选问题。
    中央委员会书记雅克·杜克洛作了关于第一个问题的报告。
    杜克洛说，在第十三次党代表大会以后，争取和平的斗争已经取得了相当大的成就，这种成就表现为“欧洲防务集团”计划的被拒绝。但是国民议会批准巴黎协定和北大西洋理事会关于使用原子武器的决定使得刚开始的国际紧张局势的缓和受到了挫折。
    杜克洛说：为防止批准巴黎协定而斗争的巨大责任落在以工人阶级为首的法国人民的身上。作为爱国者和无产阶级国际主义的拥护者、共产党员正在和所有认识到自己的民族责任和要防止德国军国主义复活的法国人并肩斗争；他们对受到阿登纳政府迫害的德国共产党和西德及德意志民主共和国的正在为反对建立新国防军而斗争的全体劳动人民和民主人士表示热烈的声援。
    杜克洛说：法国人民反对违背法国和和平的利益的巴黎协定的越来越高涨的斗争使得有可能展开
  一个强大的人民运动来防止批准这些协定。必须通过对选举共和国参议院议员的省参议员、市长和市议员的直接影响来对共和国参议院施以群众的压力。我们知道，来自法国半数省份的共和国参议院议员将在今年举行改选。
    杜克洛接着谈到由于北大西洋理事会最近作出的使用原子武器的决定而引起的更加严重的战争威胁。在这方面，他着重指出苏联政府为反对原子战争的威胁和保障世界和平及集体安全所作的不懈努力。杜克洛说，我们有责任作更大的努力来防止原子战争。为了防止这种计划中的罪行的实现，必须加强人民的抗议运动。
    杜克洛指出，世界和平理事会常务委员会关于发动一次征集签名的运动来要求毁掉一切国家储存的原子弹和立即停止制造原子弹的决议是完全符合
  一切国家的愿望的。共产党员有责任在反对原子战争的煽动者、组织者和宣传者的斗争中起带头作用。
    杜克洛号召法国共产党员加紧进行保卫正在争取民族独立的北非各殖民地人民的利益的斗争，然后他强调说，反对战争威胁的斗争同保卫工人的经济要求的斗争是有着紧密联系的。杜克洛说，政府正是希望把它在它所鼓励和支持的大工业家的协助下奉行的军国主义政策的全部重担转嫁在工人阶级和一切劳动群众的肩上，而拒绝满足工人阶级的合法要求。杜克洛着重指出有迫切必要来巩固工人阶级的行动一致。
    杜克洛说：在法国，有些政界和社会人士以及团体反对德国军国主义的复活，他们决定为了这个目的而同共产党一起斗争，并且团结民主和民族的力量，以建立一个他们所称为的“新左翼联盟”。自然，共产党只能欢迎这一切以团结希望改变我们国家的政治路线的法国男女为目的的努力而不拒绝为达到这个目的所必须采取的联合行动。然而，孟戴斯—弗朗斯的追随者正在企图利用“新左翼”的名义来作为掩饰他们的反动政策的招牌。他们企图在即将到来的选举中用“左”的字眼来迷惑选民把选票从共产党方面夺过去。法国共产党员的任务就是要用一切可能的办法来揭露反动势力的这种诡计。
    杜克洛最后说，我们是抱有工人一定会通过社会主义的胜利而获得解放的伟大希望和信心的人们。我们在我们的道路的每一个阶段所进行的斗争使我们更接近于这个目标。我们必须竭尽全力去建立工人阶级的一致行动，作为争取一切民族和民主力量的团结一致的必要条件。我们必须站在工人阶级和一切人民群众的前列，为争取全国人民所渴望和期待的改变政府的政策而斗争。我们必须为民族独立和和平政策的胜利，为我们国内自由和社会进步的政策的胜利而斗争。
    中央委员会全体会议接着开始讨论雅克·杜克洛的报告。
