The workers building the Yellow River Bridge on the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway are continuing construction as usual during the Spring Festival. The 68-kilometer section from Lanzhou to Xingxingwan is the key construction area for this year, involving approximately 15 million cubic meters of earth and stone work, as well as a double-track tunnel and more than twenty single-track tunnel projects. A large amount of equipment must pass through the first railway bridge from Lanzhou to Yinchuan. This bridge has to cross a narrow river surface with a flow rate of three meters per second, making underwater construction extremely difficult; especially during the spring flood season, when the river rises and ice floes move with the rapids, making construction even more challenging.

Responding to the call from the leadership, the workers voluntarily gave up their Spring Festival holiday and are determined to outpace the spring floods. They are using the temporary railway line laid on the "ice bridge" to transport sand and gravel in three shifts, day and night, to accelerate the construction of the bridge piers. The workers say: "As long as the bridge piers are rushed out of the water before the spring flood season, and the bridge construction task is successfully completed, it will be the greatest joy."

    修筑包兰铁路黄河大桥的职工
    在春节期间照常施工
    在包（头）兰（州）铁路工地上，修建黄河大桥的职工们自动放弃了春节休假，照常施工。从兰州到猩猩湾长六十八公里一段是今年重点施工区，有土石方工程一千五百万方左右，还有一条双轨隧道和二十多条单轨隧道工程。大量的器材要从由兰州通往银川的第一座铁路大桥通过。这座大桥要通过每秒钟流速三公尺的狭窄河面，下水工程极感困难；特别在春汛期间，河水上涨，冰块随着激流，更难施工。
    工人们响应了领导上的号召，自动放弃了春节休假，决心跑在春汛的前面。他们利用“冰桥”铺设起的轻便铁道，日夜三班运输砂石，加紧建筑桥墩。工人们说：只要在春汛期前把桥墩抢修出水面，顺利完成大桥修建任务，就是最大的愉快。
