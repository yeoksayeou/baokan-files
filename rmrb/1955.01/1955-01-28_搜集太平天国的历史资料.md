    Collecting Historical Materials on the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom

    The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Cultural and Historical Investigation Team of Guangxi Province has collected many valuable cultural relics and historical materials in Jintian Village and other places, many of which are background materials that were previously lacking regarding the Taiping Rebellion before and after its uprising. The investigation team has now compiled 70,000 words of detailed records and is analyzing and researching them with reference to relevant materials.

    In the Jintian Village area of ​​Zijing Mountain, the birthplace of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution, the investigation team interviewed nearly 300 elderly people of Han, Zhuang, and Yao ethnicities and people who understood the situation of the Taiping Rebellion at that time. It has already taken rubbings of 16 relevant inscriptions and photographed more than 60 historical sites and photos of family trees, contracts, utensils, etc., of relevant figures. From a Qing Dynasty inscription, it can be seen that armed miners had already appeared in the Guixian area on the eve of the Taiping Army's uprising. During the interviews, the members of the investigation team also learned that many Zhuang and Yao farmers participated in the uprising at that time, and initially confirmed in relevant materials that Wei Changhui was a Zhuang person.

    搜集太平天国的历史资料
    广西省太平天国文史调查团在金田村等地搜集到许多珍贵的文物和历史资料，其中很多是过去缺乏的太平天国起义前后的背景材料。调查团现已整理了七万字的详细记录，正参考有关资料，进行分析研究。
    调查团在太平天国革命起源地紫荆山金田村一带访问了近三百名汉、僮、瑶族老人和了解一些当时太平天国起义情况的人；已拓下有关碑记十六幅；摄了六十多张历史遗迹和有关人物的族谱、契约、用具等照片，在一块清代的碑记中，可以看出在太平军起义前夕，贵县一带已经出现了矿工的武装。调查团的团员们在访问中还了解到当时有不少僮族和瑶族农民参加起义；并在有关材料中初步证实了韦昌辉是僮族人。（新华社）
