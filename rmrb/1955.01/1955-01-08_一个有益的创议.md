    A Beneficial Initiative
    Shi Ming
    The mechanical operators and repair workers of the Shuangyashan Coal Mine recently submitted an application to the administration. They said: In order not to delay production and to enable the mine to produce more wealth for the country, they are willing to use the Spring Festival holiday this year to overhaul mechanical and electrical equipment.
    The leading comrades of the Shuangyashan Mining Bureau accepted the workers' application and, based on their suggestions, made an overhaul plan, and issued construction instruction charts for important projects. The materials and tools needed for the overhaul were also prepared according to the planned items. Proper arrangements were also made in advance for the problems that overhaul workers might encounter during the holiday work, such as accommodation, food, and transportation. The Mining Bureau also plans to organize mobile inspection teams and visiting groups during the holiday overhaul period to strengthen the leadership of the overhaul work and ensure the quality of the overhaul work.
    The mechanical operators and repair workers of the Shuangyashan Mining Bureau, in order not to delay the country's production, are willing to give up their holidays and shoulder the very arduous overhaul work. This behavior of consciously subordinating personal interests to national interests and overall interests fully demonstrates the high degree of initiative and conscious spirit of the Chinese working class in building the socialist cause. The leaders of the Shuangyashan Mining Bureau supported the workers' suggestions with a positive attitude and properly arranged good working conditions for them, which is also entirely appropriate.
    Now is the beginning of the year, and many machines and equipment in factories and mining enterprises need to be overhauled during this period after a year of operation last year. This is an important task to ensure the normal progress of production work in 1955. In the past, the equipment overhaul work of many enterprises was carried out during production time, which had to cause a certain loss to production. Of course, it is inevitable that some overhaul work will take up a certain amount of production time. However, some overhaul work can also be carried out during the holidays. Using holidays to do overhaul work can not only reduce production losses, but also the working environment is quiet during the holidays, which can reduce many external interference, and the work efficiency can also be improved. If the staff and workers of industrial and mining enterprises can learn from the conscious actions of the mechanical operators and repair workers of the Shuangyashan Coal Mine and use the holidays to carry out the overhaul of machinery and equipment, then they will save a considerable amount of wealth for the country.
    We hope that the staff and workers who are responsible for overhaul work will learn from this meaningful initiative of the workers of the Shuangyashan Coal Mine.

    一个有益的创议
    施明
    双鸭山煤矿的机械操纵工人和检修工人，最近向行政上提出了一项申请书。他们说：为了不耽误生产，使矿山能为国家生产更多的财富，愿意利用今年春节假期，来检修机械电气设备。
    双鸭山矿务局领导同志接受了工人们的这个申请，并根据他们的建议作出了检修计划，对重要的工程做出了施工指示图表。检修时需要的材料和工具，也根据计划项目作了准备。检修职工在假期工作时可能碰到的宿食、交通工具等问题，也都事先作了妥善的安排。矿务局还准备在假期的检修期中，组织巡回检查组和慰问团，来加强检修工作的领导，保证检修工作的质量。
    双鸭山矿务局的机械操纵工人和检修工人们，为了不耽误国家的生产，甘愿放弃自己的假日，肩负起十分辛苦的检修工作，这种把个人利益自觉地服从国家利益和整体利益的行为，充分表现了我国工人阶级建设社会主义事业的高度积极性和自觉精神。双鸭山矿务局领导上以积极态度支持了工人们的建议，妥善地为他们安排了良好的工作条件，这种作法也是完全应当的。
    现在正是一年之始，工厂和矿山企业的许多机器设备，经过去年一年的运行之后，都须要在这期间进行检修，这是保证一九五五年生产工作正常进行的一项重要任务。过去，许多企业的设备检修工作，都是在生产时间内进行的，这就不得不使生产受到一定损失。当然，有许多检修工作，占用一定的生产时间是不可免的。但是有一些检修工作利用假期来进行也是完全可以的。利用假期来作检修工作，不但可以减少生产的损失，而且假期中工作环境也安静，可以少受许多外来的干扰，工作效率也能提高。假如工矿企业部门的职工同志，都能学习双鸭山煤矿机械操纵工人和检修工人们的这种自觉行动，利用假期来进行机器设备的检修工作，那么他们就将为国家节约出一笔很可观的财富。
    我们希望担任检修工作的职工同志，都来学习双鸭山煤矿职工们这个有意义的创议。
