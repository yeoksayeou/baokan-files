    Policies and Tasks
    By our reporter, An Gang
    After criticizing negative thoughts, the state-owned and cooperative commerce in Northeast China has undergone a significant change in its work. Those who lacked confidence in the past now have confidence. Many leading workers have begun to realize that the previous period of simply asking superiors to reduce tasks while neglecting to rely on the power of the masses had brought no small losses to the comprehensive completion of the 1954 plan. However, judging from the situation in various places, there are still many problems in both purchasing and sales work. The main problem is that some areas and some comrades neglect policies in the execution of tasks, and even put the completion of tasks in opposition to the mastery of policies.
    Some people say, "To implement policies is to fail to complete tasks." In their view, policies are like stumbling blocks to completing tasks. Others say, "Completing tasks is the priority; policies can be implemented after ideological understanding is achieved." These two statements manifest as a lack of policy perspective in practical work. The so-called "committing the mistake of a purely task-oriented viewpoint," often mentioned in self-criticisms, is a concentrated expression of this kind of thinking. It should be pointed out that completing the tasks of the Party and the state is the bounden duty of everyone. The problem is that some comrades have not completed their tasks in accordance with the policies and guidelines stipulated by the Party. They often complete their tasks by departing from the Party's policies or by replacing policies with feelings. Real life has repeatedly proven that those who do so will definitely not be able to complete the task accurately and comprehensively. Even if it seems that the task has been completed on the surface at a certain time, there must be serious problems hidden or lurking behind it.
    The plans of state-owned commerce are determined according to the Party's commercial policy. Correctly implementing the policy is the only way to correctly complete the plan, and at the same time, only by correctly completing the plan can the state's commercial policy be embodied. Leaving policy will inevitably lead to mistakes.
    From a policy perspective, purchasing and sales are two unified components of the Party's policy. The Party and the state's policy requirements are to do a good job in purchasing and to fully supply the needs of farmers, and to complete sales tasks. Only in this way can we serve the development of production and meet the needs of the people. Why is sales work not given enough attention? It is said that in order to sell, one must purchase goods, and there are four fears about purchasing goods: fear of backlog, fear of interest, fear of losing money, and fear of criticism. It is also said that "failing to complete the sales plan only means failing to complete one plan, but if you purchase more goods and increase inventory, you will fail to complete two plans (referring to the financial plan)." Under the control of this erroneous thinking, some supply and marketing cooperatives in Heilongjiang Province "purchase less and sell more, take cash and sell immediately, substitute with what is available, and substitute with old goods for new ones." Some places in Rehe Province put forward the principle of "purchasing less and frequently, with no stockouts as the principle." Individual commercial departments in Shenyang City put forward "purchasing based on sales"; "stockouts of certain varieties are not considered stockouts." From these statements, we see that these comrades do not truly understand the Party's tasks, but subjectively arrange tasks for themselves. They have forgotten that the most fundamental thing in all our tasks is to serve the masses, to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, and to promote the development of production and the progress of society. This is the unity of policy and task. In the previous period, we heard many comrades from trade departments and cooperatives shouting about "the plan being too big," "changes in purchasing power," and "failure to complete the sales plan." They attributed the main reason for failing to complete the commercial plan to "the masses buying less." However, with the arrival of the peak season, we are now hearing criticisms from the masses about the market not being able to fully meet the needs of the people. People are reflecting that there are stockouts in rural supply and marketing cooperatives. When rural supply and marketing cooperatives request goods from some third-level wholesale stations, they use the excuse that "industrial production is insufficient" and do not actively organize sources of goods, which directly affects the sales work of the cooperatives. In the previous period, 500 kinds of marketable goods, calculated by specifications, were out of stock in the Chifeng County Mass Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Rehe Province, including 64 kinds of cotton yarn. The county state-owned department store only had 13 kinds of cotton shoes and warm boots, which were most needed by farmers, and the supply and marketing cooperative only had two kinds. The Jilin Provincial Wholesale Station originally planned to purchase 4,000 dog skin hats, but the demand plan from the counties was 12,500 hats, and the actual need was even greater. According to a report by the Jilin Inspection Team of the Northeast Commercial Bureau, "all counties are clamoring that dog skin hats are insufficient." A survey of 321 cooperatives in Taonan County found that as of early November, there were a total of 320 pairs of wula boots in stock, averaging less than one pair per cooperative. Leather hats and felt socks were also old goods from the previous year. Many supply and marketing cooperatives in Lishu County did not purchase the cold-proof materials that people urgently needed. In many areas of Heilongjiang Province, winter materials suitable for rural sales had not yet been placed in grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives by the end of October, and winter cold-proof products accounted for only about 5% to 10% of the total inventory of many cooperatives. Obviously, this practice can only increase the difficulty of people's purchases, fail to fully meet the needs of the people's production and life, and seriously affect the relationship between the Party and the people. For example, after the implementation of planned supply of edible oil, many places did not guarantee the planned supply of edible oil to farmers. As a result, it not only affected the completion of the purchase task and hindered production (farmers need to use oil to lubricate the axles of carts), but also failed to guarantee the basic needs of the people. This violates the fundamental policy of the Party and the state to maximize the satisfaction of the people's needs on the basis of existing production.
    In this case, will the purchase work really be done well? Facts have proved that if the policy thinking is not correct, the purchase work will also have problems. For example, in purchasing live pigs, Liaoning Province's purchase plan for the fourth quarter of last year was 178,909 heads, but only 37.34% of the quarterly plan had been completed by the end of November. The purchase plan for the fourth quarter of last year in Rehe Province was 47,000 heads, but only 8,578 heads had been completed by the end of October. Several major cities in Liaoning Province, such as Shenyang and Anshan, experienced pork shortages for three months last year. Was it because there were too few pigs? No, there were pigs. The problem was that some comrades neglected policies when purchasing pigs. They did not conduct sufficient political work among the farmers. Some farmers were worried that they would not be able to get oil after selling pigs, but this was not explained and resolved in a timely manner. Some provinces did a better job. They were able to purchase an average of 5,000 pigs a day. Similarly, the purchase of cattle and sheep in the Northeast region has generally exceeded the plan. If it were just for the sake of purchasing, one would be satisfied. However, if we examine the purchase situation from a policy perspective, we will find that many of the cattle purchased are draft cattle. The occurrence of this phenomenon is because some farmers have misunderstandings about joining agricultural production cooperatives. In this case, the purchasing workers should give a full explanation to those farmers who sell draft cattle, eliminate their concerns, advise them not to sell the draft cattle and affect agricultural production, and report the situation to the higher authorities in a timely manner. It can be seen that without a policy perspective, even if we try our best to grasp the purchase work, the result will still not be good.
    From a policy perspective, doing a good job in purchasing or sales tasks must have a mass viewpoint and follow the mass line. However, some people do the opposite. They are only satisfied with a set of administrative orders. This practice is manifested in purchasing as assigning numbers from top to bottom and forcing completion on schedule. Before December of last year, Baicheng County's plan to purchase live pigs had not been completed. According to the materials from the general survey at the end of August last year, there were about 69,725 large and small pigs in the 16 districts of the county, 28,612 of which could be raised into fattened pigs. After deducting 18,597 heads for farmers' own consumption, there would be 10,015 commercial pigs throughout the year. According to the analysis of the county native products company, in the fourth quarter, excluding the normal consumption of farmers preparing for the Spring Festival, there should be at least 5,904 commercial pigs. This is the real basis for completing the plan to purchase live pigs in the fourth quarter. However, only 390 live pigs had been purchased by November 10. What was the reason? The problem was that they only paid attention to acting according to the numbers and did not carry out the work in accordance with the mass line. Huaide County Food Company has adopted the working method of the mass line in purchasing live pigs. From the second half of the year before last to now, it has always completed the purchase plan, and has exceeded the purchase plan by 50% to 70% in the second and third quarters of last year. Huaide County Food Company once organized rural procurement teams to go deep into the countryside to find out the opinions of farmers and the situation of raising live pigs, and relied closely on the Party's organization to carry out mass work. For example, in January last year, the procurement staff reported to the Party's district committee that the fifth district had a poor completion rate. The district party secretary immediately convened the branch secretaries to specifically study the matter, convened meetings of farmers and activists in the village to mobilize them, and explained that selling pigs to the state would guarantee exports and the needs of industrial and mining cities, which would support the country's industrialization. After the farmers understood the truth, some people who originally wanted to slaughter pigs for their own consumption also sold them to the state. The food company also relied on the cooperative to open technical training courses to improve the acceptance skills of the cooperative's purchasing staff, and also changed some practices according to the opinions of farmers, which was welcomed by the farmers, and finally overfulfilled the task. The comparison of these two facts can fully prove that purchasing work is originally a good thing for farmers, and is in line with the farmers' own interests. However, only when we carry out purchasing using the working method of the mass line can we truly make farmers feel the care of the Party and the state for the farmers, thereby ensuring the completion of the state's purchase task.
    Similarly, there are two different practices in sales work:
    One practice is to simply distribute sales figures, thinking that as long as the numbers are completed, that's all. Thus, the erroneous ideas and styles of "the government is the only place to buy," "waiting for customers at the door," and "buy it or not" have emerged, divorced from the masses. When some farmers ask the salesperson how much a product costs, the answer is: "Isn't it written up there?" The farmer said: "If I could read, I wouldn't ask you." When farmers ask to buy colored cloth, the store is out of stock. The salesperson does not patiently explain, but instead says: "The dyeing factory hasn't dyed it for you yet!" Why are the attitudes of these salespeople so bad? One of the reasons is that the superiors did not correctly explain the policies when assigning tasks, and did not educate the staff on service attitudes, explaining that our relationship with customers is not an old buying and selling relationship, but a relationship between socialist commercial enterprises and farmers; we must make farmers see the Party's policies and the state's care and support for farmers from every move of the store; and we must use a sincere service attitude and a spirit of serving the interests of the masses to educate farmers and improve their awareness. If that place fails to do this, it will definitely not be able to complete the sales task. Another practice is to constantly understand the needs and opinions of the masses, and to combine the completion of the state's planned target tasks with meeting the needs of the masses as much as possible. The Fuxin County Department Store cooperated with the purchase of surplus grain in rural areas to find out the needs of the countryside before the New Year. They conducted typical household surveys of different economic conditions. The survey materials proved that although production was reduced last year, the purchasing power was very large because farmers had a good harvest the year before and the state increased the purchase of cattle, sheep, and pigs last year, with some cooperatives increasing by more than four times compared with the same period last year. They mobilized employees to increase the sales plan by calculating accounts, and sent people to the Jinzhou Wholesale Station to open up sources of goods, and supplemented the purchase contract according to the needs of the masses. They signed specific variety supply contracts with grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in the supply area to connect the plans of state-owned department stores and supply and marketing cooperatives, and assigned special personnel to contact cooperatives frequently to reduce the burden on cooperative staff. They also invited cooperative salespersons to visit warehouses to expand the supply of industrial products to the countryside, and at the same time launched a campaign to increase production and practice economy in retail stores. According to this practice, not only can the planned numerical tasks be completed, but also the original plan will be revised and supplemented to make the plan truly closely linked to the people's lives. Facts in various places have repeatedly proved that the correct service attitude of salespersons is completely inseparable from the improvement of policy thinking. The Beishi Store of Shenyang Department Store once counted in the previous period that salespeople quarreled with customers accounted for 27%. Many customers said that salespeople were "judges of the yamen." After conducting education on socialist civilized business, many people became active through learning and inspection. Everyone began to be courteous and amiable to customers, and quickly received praise from customers. Critical opinions from the masses in the opinion book were reduced by 70%. Some salespersons warmly received customers, and the masses reflected: "You treat customers too thoughtfully. These are all good things under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao." This clearly shows that the quality of service attitude is not a personal matter, but a political issue. People link the service attitude with the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. This is the greatest glory of socialist commercial enterprises serving the people.
    Many comrades oppose the implementation of policies with the completion of tasks in actual work. This is a fundamental reason why many departments cannot fully complete the state plan. They simplify all the tasks entrusted by the Party and the state into large and small numbers. They only simply require struggling to complete a certain number of tasks, but do not correctly explain the policy content that should be included in each specific number, neglecting that the spirit of the Party's policy must be correctly embodied in the completion of the task, and closely link with workers, peasants and other masses to promote the development of the national socialist construction cause. Therefore, this ideological tendency is essentially a manifestation of neglecting the leading role of the Party.
    The Party's general line in the transition period is the lighthouse that illuminates all work. All statements and practices that do not conform to the Party's policy viewpoint violate the spirit of the general line, and thus will inevitably cause losses to the work. The fundamental way to solve this problem is to strengthen the political work in trade cooperation departments, especially their grassroots organizations, improve the policy viewpoint of staff in the execution of specific tasks, and thoroughly eliminate all non-political tendencies that are incompatible with socialist ideology.

    政策和任务
    本报记者  安岗
    东北各地国营商业和合作社商业在批判消极思想后，整个工作开始有了显著的改变。过去没有信心的人现在有了信心；很多领导工作者开始体会到：前一个时期单纯要求上级削减任务而忽视依靠群众的力量，已经给全面完成一九五四年的计划带来不小的损失。但是，根据各地情况来看，无论在收购和推销工作中都还存在着不少问题。主要是若干地区和若干同志在执行任务中忽视政策，甚至把完成任务同掌握政策两者对立起来。
    一种人说：“要贯彻政策，就完不成任务，”在他们看来，政策仿佛是完不成任务的绊脚石；另一种人则说：“完成任务要紧，政策等把思想搞通了再来贯彻。”这两种说法在实际工作中就表现为执行任务时缺乏政策观点。很多人检讨中常常提到的所谓“犯了单纯任务观点的毛病”，就是这种思想的集中表现。应当指出：完成党和国家的任务是每一个人应尽的责任。问题是有些同志没有按照党所规定的政策和方针去完成任务，他们常常是离开党的政策或是以感想代替政策去完成任务。现实生活一再证明，凡是这样作的就一定不能准确地全面完成任务，即使在一定时候从表面上看似乎是完成了任务，但在它的后面必然隐藏着或是潜伏着严重的问题。
  国营商业的计划是根据党的商业政策确定的，正确地贯彻政策才能正确地完成计划，同时也只有正确地完成计划，才能体现国家的商业政策。离开政策就不可避免地要犯错误。
    从政策观点来看，收购和推销是党的政策的统一的两个组成部分，党和国家的政策要求是既要作好收购工作，又要充分供应农民需要，完成推销任务。只有这样，才能为发展生产和满足人民需要服务。为什么不大重视推销工作呢？据说是因为要推销就得进货，而对进货有四怕：怕积压、怕利息、怕赔钱、怕批评。还说：“完不成销售计划只是完不成一个计划，如果再进货加大库存就得完不成两个计划（指财务计划）。”在这种错误思想支配下，黑龙江省有些地区的供销合作社就“少进多卖，现取现卖，以有代无，以陈代新”；热河省有些地方提出“少进勤进，以不脱销为原则”；沈阳市个别商业部门提出“以销定购”；“品种缺货不算脱销”。从这些提法中我们看到了这些同志并不是真正了解党的任务，而是主观地给自己安排任务。他们忘掉了我们一切任务之中最根本的东西是为群众服务，是巩固工农联盟，是推动生产的发展和社会的前进。这也就是政策和任务的统一。前一时期我们曾听到不少贸易部门和合作社的工作同志关于“计划大了”
  “购买力发生变化”“销售计划完不成”的叫喊，他们把完不成商业计划的主要原因推之于“群众买的少”。可是，随着旺季的到来，现在我们又听到了来自群众的对市场不能充分满足人民需要的批评。人们反映：农村供销合作社存在着脱销现象。有些三级批发站当农村供销合作社要求进货时，借口说是“工业品生产不足”，不去积极组织货源，直接影响了合作社的推销工作。前一时期，热河省赤峰县群众供销合作社适销货以规格计算有五百种脱销，其中花纱布缺六十四种。农民最需要的棉鞋、暖靴，县国营百货公司只有十三种，供销合作社只有两种。吉林省批发站原计划购进狗皮帽子四千顶，各县要货计划是一万二千五百顶，而实际需要还更多。据东北商业局吉林检查组报告，“各县都吵嚷狗皮帽子不足”。洮南县调查全县三百二十一个社，截至十一月上旬共计存有靰鞡三百二十双，平均一个社不到一双，皮帽子和毡袜也是前年的陈货。梨树县许多供销合作社对人民迫切需要的防寒物资没有进货。黑龙江省不少适合农村销售的冬季物资在十月末还没有摆到基层供销合作社，不少合作社冬季御寒品只占全部库存的百分之五到十左右。显然，这种作法只能增加人民购买的困难，不能充分满足人民生产和生活的需要，严重影响党和人民群众的关系。譬如食油实行计划供应后，不少地方没有保证按计划供应农民食油，其结果不但影响了收购任务的完成，妨害了生产（农民要用油浇大车车轴），而且不能保证人民的基本需要。这就违反了党和国家在现有生产基础上最大限度满足人民需要的根本方针。
    在这样情况下，是否就会真正把收购工作作好呢？事实证明，政策思想不端正，收购工作同样也会出毛病。譬如收购毛猪，辽宁省去年第四季度收购计划是十七万八千九百零九头，截至十一月末只完成了季度计划百分之三十七点三四。热河省去年第四季度收购计划为四万七千头截至十月末只完成八千五百七十八头。辽宁省几个主要城市如沈阳、鞍山，去年曾有三个月猪肉脱销。是不是因为猪太少了呢？不是的，猪是有的。问题是在收购猪的时候，有些同志忽视了政策，他们没有在农民中进行充分的政治工作，农民中有怕卖了猪取不到油等顾虑，但没有得到及时的解释和解决。有的省作得好些，他们平均一天就能收购五千头猪，又如目前东北地区收购牛羊都是普遍超额完成了计划，如果是为收购而收购，那就可以心满意足了。可是如果从政策观点来考查一下收购的情况，我们便会发现，在这些被收购的牛中有不少是耕牛。这种现象的发生，是因为有些农民对加入农业生产合作社有误解，在这样情况下，收购工作者就应当向那些卖耕牛的农民作充分解释，消除顾虑，劝告他们不要卖
  掉耕牛影响农业生产，并把情况及时反映给上级处理。由此可见，离开了政策观点，即是使全力抓收购工作，结果还是不会作好的。
    从政策观点看，作好收购或是销售任务必须要有群众观点和走群众路线。但是有些人与此相反，他们只满足于行政命令的一套办法，这种作法表现在收购上，是自上而下地布置数字，强制按期完成。去年十二月以前，白城县收购活猪计划是没有完成的。根据去年八月末普查的材料，全县十六个区约有大小毛猪六万九千七百二十五头，可育成肥猪两万八千六百一十二头，除去农民自己消费一万八千五百九十七头外，全年商品猪有一万零十五头。据县土产公司分析，第四季度除去农民准备春节的正常消费，至少要有商品猪五千九百零四头。这就是完成第四季度收购活猪计划的实在根据。可是，到十一月十日止，只收购了活猪三百九十头。什么原因呢？毛病就在于他们只注意按数字行事，而没有按照群众路线的方法来进行工作。怀德县食品公司收购活猪由于采取了群众路线的工作方法，从前年下半年到现在，一直完成收购计划，去年第二、第三季度都超额百分之五十到七十完成收购计划。怀德县食品公司曾组织农村采购组，深入农村摸清农民的意见和饲养活猪情况，紧紧依靠党的组织来进行群众工作，如去年一月，五区完成任务差，采购员即向党的区委会汇报，区委书记马上召集支部书记具体研究，在村里召集农民和积极分子会议进行动员，说明把猪卖给国家保证出口和工矿城市需要，就是支援国家工业化。农民懂得道理后，有人本想杀猪自吃的也都卖给国家了。食品公司又依靠合作社开技术训练班，提高合作社收购人员的验收技术，还按照农民意见改变了一些作法，受到农民欢迎，最后超额完成了任务。这两个事实的对比可以充分证明，收购工作对农民来说，本来是好事，是符合于农民切身利益的，可是只有当我们用群众路线的工作方法来进行收购时，才能真正使农民感到党和国家对农民的关怀，从而保证完成国家的收购任务。
    同样在销售工作上也存在着两种不同的作法：
  一种作法是单纯分配销售数字，认为只要完成数字
  就算，于是就产生了“官家买卖独一处”、“坐门
  待客”、“爱买不买”等等错误思想和脱离群众的作
  风。有的农民买货问营业员价钱多少，回答是：“那上边不是写着了吗？”农民说：“我要识字还不问你啦。”农民要求买带彩色的布，商店缺货，营业员不去耐心解释，反而说：“染房还没有给你染出来呢！”这些营业员的态度为什么这样恶劣呢？原因之一是上级在布置任务时没有正确地交代政策，没有对工作人员进行服务态度的教育，说明我们同顾客的关系不是旧的卖买关系，而是社会主义商业企业同农民的关系；要使农民从商店的一举一动中看到党的政策，看到国家对农民的爱护和支援；要用诚恳的服务态度和为群众利益服务的精神来教育农民提高他们的觉悟。那个地方没有作到这一点，就一定不能完成销售任务。另一种作法是经常了解群众需要和意见，把完成国家的计划数字任务同尽可能满足群众要求结合起来。阜新县百货公司配合农村余粮收购摸清新年前的农村需要，他们作了不同经济状况的典型户调查，调查材料证明，去年虽然年成减产，但由于农民有前年丰收的底，去年国家对牛羊猪等收购量增大，有的合作社比前年同期增加四倍多，因此购买力很大，他们发动职工用算账的方式增订了销售计划，派人到锦州批发站开辟货源，按照群众需要补充了进货合同。他们一面同供应区内的基层供销合作社签订具体品种供应合同，把国营百货公司计划和供销合作社计划衔接起来，确定专人同合作社经常联络，减轻合作社工作人员负担，还邀请合作社营业员参观仓库，扩大工业品下乡，同时在零售商店也展开了增产节约竞赛。按照这样的作法，不但可以完成计划的数字任务，而且还会修正和补充原计划，使计划真正同人民生活紧密联在一起。各地事实一再证明，营业员正确的服务态度同政策思想的提高是完全分不开的。沈阳市百货公司北市商店前一个时期统计，营业员同顾客吵嘴竟占百分之二十七，很多顾客说营业员是“衙门的审判官”。在进行了社会主义文明经商的教育后，很多人通过学习和检查积极起来，大家开始作到对顾客殷勤和蔼，很快地就受到顾客的表扬，意见簿上群众批评性的意见减少了百分之七十。有些营业员热诚招待顾客，群众的反映是：
  “你们对待顾客可太周到了，这些都是共产党、毛主席领导的好啊。”这多么明显地说明了，服务态度的好坏不是个人的事情，而是一个政治问题，人们把服务态度同党和毛主席的领导联在一起，这正是社会主义商业企业为人民服务的最大的光荣。
    不少同志在实际工作中把执行政策同完成任务两者对立起来，这是很多部门不能全面完成国家计划的一个根本原因。他们把党和国家委托的各项任务都简单化为大大小小的数目字，他们只是单纯要求为完成多少数字任务而奋斗，而没有去正确说明在每一个具体数字中所应当包括的政策内容，忽视了在完成任务中必须正确体现党的政策精神，密切同工人农民和其他群众的联系，来推进国家社会主义建设事业的发展。因此，这种思想倾向实质上乃是一种忽视党的领导作用的表现。
    党在过渡时期的总路线，是照耀着各项工作的灯塔，一切不符合党的政策观点的说法和作法都是与总路线的精神相违背的，因而也就不可避免地会使工作受到损失。解决这个问题的根本办法，是加强贸易合作部门特别是其基层组织中的政治工作，提高工作人员在执行具体任务中的政策观点，彻底肃清一切同社会主义思想不相容的非政治倾向。
