The 90-meter-long Lang Son Railway Bridge was also completed on the 4th, and a train carrying rails and sleepers passed over the bridge that day. The new track is extending southward. At the southern end, the rails from Hanoi to Phu Lang Thuong were laid in the last hour of 1954.

The technical workers from China who have arrived along the railway line for bridge construction, road paving, water supply building construction, and communication equipment installation have brought locomotives, carriages, rails, cranes, pneumatic picks, and various road construction machinery and equipment. These Chinese workers in blue clothes work alongside Vietnamese workers in maroon clothes. They are warmly welcomed by the Vietnamese people and road construction workers.
