　　The Motherland Adds Another Modern Factory
　　Wen Juan
　　After more than two years of reconstruction, the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory has been transformed from a simple small factory into a modern one. Now, this factory produces the latest rock drills, rivetters, air drills, air shovels and other pneumatic tools every day. According to the design requirements, its output is a hundred times greater than during the Japanese puppet regime.
　　The predecessor of the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory was the "Manchuria Metal Factory" established in Shenyang by Japanese imperialists in 1934. During the Kuomintang rule, it was renamed "Northeast Automobile General Factory," but in reality, it was used to produce munitions. Only after returning to the embrace of the people did this factory begin producing old-fashioned rock drills and rivetters at the end of 1949, serving peace and construction.
　　Before the reconstruction, the Pneumatic Tool Factory only had a small, low factory building pieced together from several workshops. In the mechanical assembly workshop, there were dozens of belt lathes. The dense layers of belts and line shafts blocked the weak light coming in from the skylights, making it difficult to work even during the day without turning on the lights. Especially before liberation, in the summer, the inside of the building became a river when it rained outside; in the winter, there were no stoves, and the workers suffered a lot.
　　Now, when people step into the gate of the factory, they immediately feel a new life: facing them is a wide concrete road, flanked by red factory buildings, and a chimney more than thirty meters high made of red bricks emitting green smoke. More than a thousand trees have already been planted around the factory buildings, and a large number of flowers and plants will be planted this year. After all the greening work is completed, there will be a small garden, six flower beds, and a rockery in the factory area, for workers to take walks and chat.
　　All the workshops have been completely renewed. The mechanical assembly workshop has ample light. The belt lathes have been completely removed. What appears before our eyes is a brand-new set of box-type machine tools, as well as more than sixty types of new machine tools with different performance, such as the Soviet Union's newly manufactured automatic double-hole drilling machines and semi-automatic screw milling machines. It is really convenient to work with semi-automatic screw milling machines. As long as the worker puts the workpiece in place and adjusts the machine, the machine tool will automatically cut and retract. In the past, making the spring buckle of a pneumatic pick required two processes—first turning and then milling, and one person could make at most twelve a day; now, using a semi-automatic screw milling machine, one person can make more than fifty a day. The efficiency of the double-hole drilling machine is even higher. As long as the worker aligns the size and depth of the hole to be drilled, the drill bit of this machine will automatically drill into it; if the iron filings fill the drilled hole, the drill bit will automatically retract, and when the automatically flowing oil washes the iron filings out of the hole, the drill bit will automatically drill back in; it will continue drilling to the required depth, and the light on the machine will light up to tell the worker that the job is done. At this point, whether the worker comes or not, the machine will automatically stop. One worker can watch two such machines at the same time, and each machine can do two jobs simultaneously.
　　The heat treatment workshop is a high-temperature operation. Before the reconstruction, the workers called it the "fire field." There were only eight dilapidated carburizing furnaces in the workshop, and the factory building was small and narrow, with coal smoke and dust flying everywhere, and the air was very bad. After the reconstruction, the factory building is three times larger than before, the walls are all painted white, and there are ventilators to keep it warm in winter and cool in summer. In the factory building, coal smoke and flying dust can no longer be seen. Workers no longer have to hold fire hooks and iron bars and stand in front of brick furnaces at nearly a thousand degrees, because now they are all Soviet-made electric furnaces and carburizing furnaces.
　　Before the reconstruction, the quality of products was not strictly and scientifically inspected. Now, a new central laboratory has been established. The laboratory is fully equipped. In the physical and chemical testing section, there is a huge fluoroscope that can see through steel. Before steel materials and castings are made into parts, this fluoroscope can be used to see if there are air bubbles or other inclusions inside. There is also a crystal spectrograph that can measure the ratio of various elements contained in steel and take photos, so that people can check whether the composition of the steel is suitable. There is also a horizontal microscope that can magnify the internal structure of steel 1,300 times, so that people can more clearly observe cracks and impurities. With these instruments, the physical properties and chemical composition of steel materials can be known like the back of one's hand, controlling the hardness, toughness, and elasticity of each part from the raw material aspect, thus ensuring the quality of the product.
　　The working conditions in this factory are very good. The boiler room, tool, forging, and mechanical assembly workshops each have a large welfare department, including locker rooms and shower rooms for male and female workers. When workers go to work, they can change into work clothes in the locker room and go to work. After work, they can take a shower and then put on clean clothes and go home refreshed. The ventilation and heating equipment in the workshop are very complete. Special dust collectors are installed in places where there is smoke, such as grinding machines and paint booths. The workshop maintains a certain temperature in winter, and can insulate the direct heat of the sun in summer.
　　The workers pay great attention to the cleanliness and order of the environment and implement "civilized production." In the past, when people mentioned the air compressor station, they would say, "It's so dirty." This is because air compressors need oil and water. Once started, the oil in the tank would run out, and the water pipes would leak. The oil and water would fall on the ground and seep into the dust, making the room look unsightly. But now, entering the air compressor station gives people a different feeling: the two machines are wiped brighter than a mirror every day; the tools used by the workers are placed in an orderly manner, and everyone who comes here praises them.
　　There is a worker in the Pneumatic Tool Factory with more than 20 years of experience, named Xu Lianying. In the past, when he heard people introduce the situation of Soviet factories, he regarded them as "myths." However, such "myths" have become a reality in front of him. The workers are happy to be able to work in this factory. They are learning to further master these new equipment and new technologies, and produce a large number of pneumatic tools for the national mining, transportation, machine manufacturing, and basic construction departments.

    祖国又增加了一座现代化的工厂
    雯娟
    经过两年多的改建工作，沈阳风动工具厂已经由一个简陋的小工厂变为一个现代化的工厂了。现在，这个工厂每天生产着最新式的凿岩机、铆钉机、风钻、风铲等风动工具。按照设计的要求，它的产量，比日伪统治时期大一百倍。
    沈阳风动工具厂的前身，是一九三四年日本帝国主义者在沈阳建立的“满洲金属工厂”。国民党统治时期把它改为“东北汽车总厂”，但实际上，却利用它来生产军火。只有回到人民的怀抱以后，这个厂才在一九四九年末开始生产旧式的凿岩机和铆钉机，为和平、为建设服务。
    改建前的风动工具厂，只有一座矮小的、几个车间拼凑在一起的小厂房。在机械装配车间里，摆着几十台皮带车床。密密层层的皮带和天轴，挡住了从天窗射进来的微弱光线，即使在白天，不开灯也很难干活。特别在解放以前，夏天，外面一下雨，屋里便成了河；冬天又没有炉子，工人们很受罪。
    现在，人们踏进工厂的大门，便立刻有一种新生的感觉：迎面是一条宽阔的混凝土马路，两旁是一幢一幢的红色的厂房，三十多公尺高的用红砖砌的烟囱冒着青烟。在厂房四周，已种上一千多棵树，今年还要种植大量的花草。全部绿化工作完成后，厂区内将有一个小花园，六个花坛，一个假山。供工人们散步，谈天。
    所有的车间都已焕然一新。机械装配车间的光线充足。皮带车床完全被搬走了。出现在眼前的是一色崭新的闷罐机床，还有苏联新制造成功的自动双孔钻床，半自动的螺丝铣床等六十多种性能不同的新型机床。使用半自动螺丝铣床干活真方便，只要工人把活放好，把机器调整好，电门一开，机床就会自动吃刀和退刀。过去做风镐的镐筒弹簧扣，要经过两道工序——先车后铣，一个人一天顶多做十二个；现在用半自动螺丝铣床来做，一个人一天能做五十多个。双孔钻床的效能更高，只要工人把要钻的孔的大小深浅对好，这台机器的钻头就会自动地往里钻；要是钻孔里铁末子堵满了，钻头就会自动退出来，等到自动流出来的油把孔里的铁末子冲洗净了，钻头又自动钻进去钻；一直钻到所需要的深度，机器上的电灯会亮起来，告诉工人活已经完了。这时，工人来也好，不来也好，机器就自动停下来。这样的机器，一个工人可以同时看两台，每
  一台同时可以做两个活。
    热处理车间是高温作业。改建前，工人们叫它做“火场”。车间里只有八台破旧不堪的渗炭炉，厂房又小又窄，煤烟四起，灰尘飞扬，空气非常不好。改建以后，厂房比原来的大三倍，墙壁都刷白了，并设有使冬天不冷，夏天不热的通风机。在场房里，再也看不见煤烟和飞扬的灰尘了。工人们也不用拿着火钩、铁杠，站在近千度的砖炉前工作，因为现在全是苏联制造的电气炉和渗炭炉。
    改建前，产品的质量没有严格的科学的检验。现在，新建立了中央试验室。试验室里设备十分完善。在物理化验部分，有巨大的能透视钢铁的透视机，钢铁材料、铸件在未制成部件之前，用这台透视机透视，可以看出里面有没有气泡或其他夹杂质。还有那水晶摄谱仪，可以把钢铁里面含的各种元素比例测定出来并拍成照片，以便人们检查钢铁的成份是否合适。还有能把钢铁内部组织放大一千三百倍，以便人们更清楚观察裂纹、杂质的卧式显微镜。有了这些仪器，钢铁材料的物理性能和化学成份便可以了如指掌，从原材料方面控制每个零件的硬度、韧性、弹性，因而保证了产品的质量。
    这个工厂的劳动条件很好。锅炉房、工具、锻压、机械装配车间，各有一个大型福利部，其中有更衣室，男女工人淋浴室。工人上班时，可以在更衣室里换上工作服去工作，下班后，先洗个澡，再穿干净的衣服爽爽快快地回家去。车间里通风、取暖的设备很完善，凡是有磨床、喷漆台等冒烟的地方，都装有特设的吸尘器。车间里冬天保持着一定的温度，夏天可以把太阳的直射热隔绝。
    工人们很注意环境的清洁和整齐，实行“文明生产”。过去人们一提起空气压缩机站，都说：“可脏了”。这是因为空气压缩机要用油和水。一开车，油箱里的油就往外跑，水管也漏水，油和水落在地上，渗上灰尘，就把屋子弄得不像样。可是现在一进空气压缩机站就给人们另一种感觉：两台机器每天擦的比镜子还亮；工人们随手用的工具放的很有秩序，谁来这里都称赞他们。
    风动工具厂有个二十多年工龄的工人，名叫徐连英，以前他听到人们介绍苏联工厂的情况时，都当做“神话”。可是，这样的“神话”已经成为摆在他面前的事实了。工人们以能在这个工厂里工作引为快乐。他们正在学习着进一步掌握这些新的设备和新的技术，为全国矿山、交通、机器制造、基本建设部门，生产大量的风动工具。（附图片）
