    Warriors Who Attacked Shanghaimen Reef
    Hu Qikun

    At the northwest end of Yijiangshan Island, there is a long reef extending into the sea, this is Shanghaimen Reef. It is an important stronghold of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops on the island.

    The rocks of Shanghaimen Reef are as sharp as saw teeth. On the reef, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops set up three rows of barbed wire fences. Mines were buried in front of the barbed wire. Inside the barbed wire was the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops’ anti-tank gun position, with the gun muzzles facing the northwest sea. Near the anti-tank gun position are several reinforced concrete bunkers, from which crossfire could be launched, blocking the west, north, and northwest sea. Further up the steep slope is the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops’ first line of trenches and bunkers.

    The Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops relied on these solid fortifications and marine obstacles to defend the island. But the warriors of the First Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army's ground forces landed here, and with the close cooperation of the naval and air forces, quickly broke through various obstacles, attacked the western peak of Yijiangshan Island, and cooperated with fraternal units to completely annihilate the defending enemy on the island.

    At noon on the 18th, the landing craft carrying the First Company's soldiers, under the powerful cover of the naval and air forces, bravely advanced towards Yijiangshan Island. The soldiers sat neatly on the boat, each full of energy and with a slight smile. Second Platoon Leader Zhuo Cheng stood on the boat, constantly looking at the smoke-filled Yijiangshan Island. He felt unspeakable excitement in his heart, because his wish had come true. He and the soldiers were determined to respond to the call of the motherland with their own practical actions, and contribute their strength in the battle to liberate the coastal islands and Taiwan of the motherland. The assault platoon he led would soon rush to Yijiangshan Island to annihilate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops.

    As the landing craft approached the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops’ forward positions, the rows of barbed wire on Shanghaimen Reef could be seen clearly. After the fierce bombing by our air force and the heavy shelling by artillery and naval guns, many of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops' forward fortifications were destroyed, and the anti-tank gun positions were also burning, the long gun barrels burned red. However, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops still stubbornly resisted by relying on some un-destroyed hidden bunkers and broken rocks, concentrating machine guns, submachine guns, and other weapons to fire fiercely at our landing forces, attempting to block our landing forces on the sea or on the beach.

    The Second Platoon's landing craft docked at the protruding part of Shanghaimen Reef. The waves rose and fell, impacting the hull of the boat. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops swept down from the reef with machine guns, throwing grenades down, and the sea water and rocks flew everywhere. The entire Shanghaimen Reef was shrouded in flames and smoke. Through the smoke, Second Platoon Leader Zhuo Cheng saw the flashing gun holes of the enemy's bunkers, and also saw that the nearby fraternal units were also suppressed by the enemy's firepower and unable to advance. He was extremely angry and immediately ordered the demolitionist Jiang Guohua to blow up the enemy's barbed wire.

    Jiang Guohua had been shot in the calf, but he resolutely did not say that he was injured and unable to fight. As soon as he received the order, he took the explosive rod and jumped onto the smoke-filled shore, gritting his teeth, bending over, and running straight towards the enemy's three rows of barbed wire in a hail of bullets.

    "Boom! Boom! Boom!" With several loud noises in a row, a large gap was blown open in the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops’ three rows of barbed wire. Sixth Squad Leader Long Xiaoyi led several soldiers like fierce tigers to pounce on the bunker, quickly eliminating the enemy in the bunker.

    After the Sixth Squad occupied the bunker, Platoon Leader Zhuo Cheng observed the front: in front was a high, steep slope, the enemy hid in the trenches and threw strings of grenades down, and the enemy's machine guns in the two reinforced concrete bunkers on both sides of the trenches were firing fiercely. Behind was the vast ocean. What a critical moment! Zhuo Cheng thought: "Delaying on the beach means failure, waiting means death, only advancing, only rapid advancement can lead to victory!" So he quickly organized various firepowers to suppress and contain the firepower of the enemy's bunkers on both sides of the trenches, and immediately issued an order to the soldiers:

    "Comrades! Climb up the steep slope, break through the waist, and catch the enemy off guard!"

    The fearless soldiers began to climb the steep slope. The steep slope was like a slide. The soldiers would slide back half a step for every step they took, some would slide back to their original place after only climbing one step, and some would roll down halfway. The soldiers had to dig a foothold with their hands or feet for every step they took, fire a few shots at the enemy or throw a grenade, and then climb up again.

    "Comrades, the time to punish the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops has come!"

    "The ocean can't stop us!"

    "Barbed wire can't stop us!"

    "Cliffs and steep walls and the enemy's trenches can't stop us either!"

    The soldiers advanced bravely amidst the loud slogans. Bullets whizzed overhead, and grenades exploded beside them. Those in front fell, and those behind continued to climb up. Just as they were about to reach the top, the enemy rolled down a large number of grenades along the steep slope. A grenade rolled right into Zhuo Cheng's arms, hissing with green smoke. Zhuo Cheng tightly grabbed the steep cliff with one hand, and quickly picked up the grenade that was about to explode with the other hand, and threw it back at the enemy fiercely. The soldiers climbed to the top and jumped bravely into the enemy's trenches.

    The Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops did not expect that our soldiers would brave such difficulties and dangers, and bravely climb up the steep slope. When they saw our soldiers jumping into the trenches, they were all panicked and fled to the bunkers on both sides. The soldiers took advantage of the situation to pursue fiercely, quickly blocking the back door of the enemy's bunkers, turning the enemy into turtles in a jar.

    The First Platoon victoriously occupied the beachhead of Shanghaimen Reef, and the road to the peak of Yijiangshan was opened. The commander looked at his watch, it was exactly 2:41. This means that the Shanghaimen Reef beachhead position, painstakingly built by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops, collapsed after only ten minutes of assault by the warriors who crossed the sea.

    打上海门礁的勇士
    胡奇坤
    在一江山岛西北端，有条长长的伸向海中的礁石，这就是海门礁。它是岛上蒋贼军的一个重要的支撑点。
    海门礁的礁石，锐利如锯齿。礁石上，蒋贼军设置着三列桩铁丝网。铁丝网前埋着地雷。铁丝网里面是蒋贼军的战防炮阵地，炮口朝着西北方海面。战防炮阵地附近有几个钢骨水泥堡，从那里发射出来的交叉火力，可以封锁正西、正北和西北的海面。再往上的陡坡上面，就是蒋贼军的第一道堑壕和地堡线。
    蒋贼军借着这些坚固的工事和海洋上的障碍来据守海岛。但人民解放军陆军某部第一连的勇士们，就从这里登了陆，并且在海、空军的密切配合下迅速地攻破了种种障碍，打上一江山岛西部高峰，配合兄弟部队全部歼灭了岛上的守敌。
    十八日中午，第一连战士们所乘的登陆艇，在强大的海、空军的掩护下，英勇地向着一江山岛航进。战士们整整齐齐地坐在艇上，个个精神奕奕，微露笑容。二排长卓成站在艇上，不时眺望着烟雾腾腾的一江山岛。他心里感到说不出的兴奋，因为他的愿望变成现实了。他和战士们决心要以自己的实际行动来响应祖国的号召，在解放祖国沿海岛屿和台湾的战斗中贡献自己的力量。他率领的一个突击排，就要很快冲上一江山岛去歼灭蒋贼军。
    登陆艇队驶近了蒋贼军的前沿阵地，海门礁上一道道铁丝网已经看得很清楚了。经过我空军的猛炸，炮兵和舰炮的猛轰，蒋贼军的前沿工事有许多被摧毁了，战防炮阵地也在燃烧，长长的炮身被烧得通红的。但是，蒋贼军仍旧依靠着一些未被摧毁的暗堡和断岩顽抗着，他们集中机关炮、机关枪、冲锋枪等武器向我登陆部队猛烈扫射，企图用火力把我军登陆部队阻挡在海洋上或是在滩头上。
    第二排的登陆艇在海门礁突出部靠岸了。岩头浪一起一落地冲击着艇身。蒋贼军在礁上用机枪往下扫，把手榴弹往下扔，炸的海水和礁石满天飞。整个海门礁被火焰和烟雾笼罩着。二排长卓成从烟雾中看到了敌人地堡的火光闪闪的枪眼，又看见附近的兄弟部队也被敌人的火力压制得不能前进。他愤怒极了，立即命令爆破员姜国华去爆破敌人的铁丝网。
    姜国华的小腿已经中弹，但他坚决不说自己负伤而不能进行战斗。他一接到命令就拿着炸药杆跳到烟雾弥漫的岸上，咬着牙，躬着腰，在枪林弹雨中直向敌人的三列桩铁丝网奔去。
    “轰！轰！轰！”连着几声巨响，蒋贼军的三列桩铁丝网被炸开了一个大缺口。六班长龙孝义带着几个战士猛虎一样地扑到地堡跟前，迅速地消灭了地堡里的敌人。
    六班占领了地堡后，排长卓成到前面一观察：正面是高高的陡坡，敌人躲在战壕里把成串的手榴弹扔下来，堑壕两端两个钢骨水泥堡里的敌人的机关枪猛烈地扫射着。在后面是汪洋大海。这是一个多么紧要的关头啊！卓成想：“在滩头上拖延就要失败，等待就是死亡，只有前进，只有迅速前进才能胜利！”于是他迅速地组织好各种火力，压制和牵制堑壕两侧敌人地堡的火力之后，马上向战士们发出了命令：
    “同志们！从陡坡爬上去，拦腰突破，打敌人一个措手不及！”
    无畏的战士们开始攀登陡坡了。陡坡像个滑梯。战士们爬一步要滑下来半步，有的刚爬上一步又滑到原来的地方，有的爬到半路又滚了下来。战士们只得爬一步用手或脚扒个脚蹬子，向敌人打几枪或是投个手榴弹，再往上爬。
    “同志们，惩罚蒋贼军的时候到了！”
    “海洋挡不住我们！”
    “铁丝网挡不住我们！”
    “悬崖陡壁和敌人的堑壕也挡不住我们！”
    战士们在宏亮的口号声中英勇前进。子弹在头上呼啸，手榴弹在身边爆炸。前面的人倒下来，后面继续往上爬。快爬到顶上了，敌人又沿着陡坡滚下来大批手榴弹。一个手榴弹正好滚在卓成的怀里，刺刺地冒着青烟。卓成一只手紧紧地抓住陡崖，一只手迅速拾起眼看就要爆炸的手榴弹，狠狠地扔回敌人。战士们爬到顶上，就奋勇地跳进了敌人的堑壕。
    蒋贼军想不到我军战士们会冒着这样的艰难和危险，英勇地攀登陡坡而上。当他们见到我军战士跳进堑壕时，都仓惶万状，争先向两侧地堡里逃窜。战士们乘势猛追，迅速堵住了敌人地堡的后门，使敌人变成了瓮中之鳖。
    第一排胜利地占领了海门礁的滩头阵地，通向一江山高峰的道路被打开了。指挥员看了一下表，正是两点四十一分。这就是说，蒋贼军苦心构筑的海门礁滩头阵地，只经过越海而来的勇士们十分钟的冲击就崩溃了。　（新华社）
