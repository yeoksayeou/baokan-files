To the Editor:

    The newly built bungalows of the Yuchi Oil Depot of the Shanxi Provincial Petroleum Company developed cracks and subsidence in 90% of the buildings within two to three months of completion. To address this issue, the Shanxi Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau sent cadres to assist the Petroleum Company in conducting an inspection.

    After the inspection, relevant personnel held a meeting to analyze the cause of the accident. An engineer from the Construction Engineering Bureau, surnamed Guo, lectured everyone at length, saying, "The soil here is collapsible loess. Because of rain, rainwater seeps into the ground, causing the soil to change. The pressure on the central pillars of the houses is high, so they subside. In addition, there are other buildings next to the houses, so the houses crack... Fortunately, the houses are made of concrete and will not collapse immediately, so they can continue to be used."

    According to his explanation, it seemed that the cracking and subsidence of the houses were blamed on the heavens for raining, the ground for having water, the houses for having pressure, and even more so for having any buildings next to them; and since the houses have not collapsed immediately, that was good enough.

    The comrades from the Petroleum Company could not understand Engineer Guo's strange reasoning and raised some questions; Engineer Guo answered them all with perfect assurance.

    Why do some places of these houses subside while others do not? Engineer Guo said, "People have lung diseases and heart diseases. The soil is the same; some suffer from this disease and some suffer from that disease; therefore, the houses do not subside evenly."

    Is the construction department responsible? Engineer Guo replied definitively, "No responsibility. If there were problems with the construction, a wooden stick could be inserted into the wall without any effort. This is not the case with these houses, so the cracks are not due to construction."

     "The Petroleum Company built houses on the same piece of land at the same time, and the others are all fine, only 90% of those built by the Construction Engineering Bureau's Engineering Company have cracks. What is the reason for this?" The comrades from the Petroleum Company raised this very practical question. This made Engineer Guo unable to speak for a long time. The room fell silent as everyone waited for Engineer Guo's answer.

    Suddenly, a comrade surnamed Yang from the Engineering Company questioned the Petroleum Company, "Who approved your construction?"

     "The higher authorities approved it."

    Upon hearing this, the comrade from the Engineering Company said angrily, "If you think the project quality is not good, then don't ask the Engineering Company to build for you in the future."

    The meeting could only end like this.

    If we are to believe the analysis of these comrades from the Shanxi Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau and the Engineering Company, there were no errors in the design department, and the construction department had no responsibility for the poor engineering quality, then the fault seems to lie with the unit using the houses.

### 工程质量低劣究竟由谁负责

    工程质量低劣究竟由谁负责编辑同志：
    山西省石油公司榆次储油所新修的平房，完工后两三个月，有百分之九十裂缝下陷。为了处理这个问题，山西省建筑工程局派干部协助石油公司进行了检查。
    检查工作结束后，有关人员开会分析事故的原因。建筑工程局一位姓郭的工程师滔滔不绝地向大家说：“这里的土壤是空心土。因为下雨，雨水渗透到地层内，土壤就要发生变化。房子正中柱子压力大，因此要下陷。再加房子旁边有其它建筑物，房子就要裂缝……。好在房子是混凝土的，不会马上倒塌，还能继续使用。”
    根据他的说法，似乎房子裂缝下陷，要怪天不该下雨，地不该有水，房子不该有压力，房子旁边更不该有任何建筑物；而房子现在还没有马上倒塌，用着就算了。
    石油公司的同志们无法领会郭工程师这番奇怪的道理，就提出了一些疑问；郭工程师都理直气壮地答复了。
    为什么这些房子有的地方下陷，有的地方不下陷呢？郭工程师说：“人有害肺病的，有害心脏病的。土壤也一样，有的害这种病，有的害那种病；所以，房子不是平衡下陷。”
    施工部门有没有责任呢？郭工程师肯定地回答说：“没有责任。如果施工有问题，拿一根木棍可以毫不费力地插进墙内。这个房子情况不是这样，因此裂缝不关施工的事。”
      “石油公司同时盖在一块地上的房子，别的都很好，只有建筑工程局工程公司修的百分之九十都裂缝。这是什么原因？”石油公司的同志又提出了这样一个很实际的问题。这使郭工程师好久没有开口。屋子里静寂下来，大家等待着郭工程师的答复。
    突然，工程公司一位姓杨的同志向石油公司提出了责问：“你们的建筑是谁批准的？”
      “上面批准的。”
    工程公司的同志听了，怒气冲冲地说：“你们认为工程质量不好，今后就不要再找工程公司建筑了。”
    会议只能这样结束了。
    如果根据山西省建筑工程局和工程局这几位同志的分析，工程质量低劣，设计部门没有错误，施工部门也没有责任，那末，过错似乎是在使用房屋的单位了。　王枝蔚
