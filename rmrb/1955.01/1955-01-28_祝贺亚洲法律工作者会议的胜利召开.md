Congratulating the Victorious Opening of the Asian Legal Workers Conference
Shen Junru
Vice-Chairman of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers
Vice-Chairman of the Council of the China Political Science and Law Society

　　For a long time, legal workers from Asian countries have had a common desire: to gather together and discuss, from a legal perspective, issues related to the common interests of Asian countries and peoples, and to promote friendly cooperation among legal workers from various countries. Asian legal workers have been contemplating this for a long time. In January 1954, at the Vienna meeting of the Council of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, the representative of Indian legal workers proposed to convene an Asian Legal Workers Conference at the end of 1954. This proposal was warmly welcomed by representatives of legal workers from Asian countries and supported and sponsored by the International Association of Democratic Lawyers. Subsequently, relevant legal workers' organizations and jurists from various countries conducted extensive contact and liaison regarding the convening of the Asian Legal Workers Conference. In September 1954, at the inaugural meeting of the All-India Association of Democratic Lawyers, a resolution was passed suggesting that the Asian Legal Workers Conference be held in Calcutta. In December of the same year, the All-India Association of Democratic Lawyers issued invitations to legal workers' organizations and jurists from Asian and neighboring countries. The Asian Legal Workers Conference was scheduled to be held in Calcutta from January 25, 1955. Legal workers from Asian and neighboring countries are preparing with great enthusiasm to send representatives to attend the conference. The China Political Science and Law Society has also formed a delegation headed by Zhang Zhiran, Vice-Chairman of the Society's Council, and Zhu Qiwen, Secretary-General of the Society, as deputy head, to go to Calcutta to attend the conference.

　　The current situation facing Asian legal workers is: on the one hand, the awakening of the people of Asian countries is increasing, the will and strength to strive for and safeguard national independence and state sovereignty are rising, the confidence in defending Asian and world peace is increasing, the peace movement is unprecedentedly strong, and the efforts to strive for and develop the people's democratic freedom are expanding and deepening. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated in the joint statements of the Prime Ministers of China and India and China and Burma have been widely welcomed and enthusiastically supported by the people of all countries—especially the people of Asia. It shows Asian and other countries in the world a bright prospect of friendly cooperation to promote common prosperity and development. On the other hand: the imperialist war-mongering elements headed by the American aggressive bloc are desperately creating tension in Asia. After the Geneva Conference achieved a certain degree of relaxation in the Asian situation, the Manila aggressive pact was immediately signed; recently, it colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group to sign the US-Chiang Treaty, attempting to occupy Taiwan for a long time as a springboard for launching war and invading the Chinese mainland; it is frantically clamoring for atomic warfare, constantly conducting atomic weapons tests in the Pacific Ocean, and actively pursuing the establishment of atomic bombing bases on Pacific islands. These war preparations seriously threaten the peace and security of Asia and the world. The American imperialists vainly attempt to suppress the ardent desire of the people of Asian countries for independence and freedom with war threats, hoping to maintain and restore their colonial rule in Asia, prevent the people of Asian countries from seeking prosperity and progress, and stifle the struggle for democratic and free rights, in order to achieve their wild ambition of permanently exploiting and enslaving the vast people of Asia. This makes it more urgent for legal workers in Asian countries to unite and work with the peace-loving and freedom-loving people of all countries to stop the threat of new wars being prepared by the imperialist war-mongers, to defend common peace and security, and to strive for and safeguard sovereign independence and democratic freedom.

　　Therefore, the convening of the Asian Legal Workers Conference at this time is of great significance. It is a good start for solidarity and cooperation among legal workers in Asian countries, and will make beneficial contributions to the cause of safeguarding national independence and state sovereignty, maintaining Asian and world peace and security, and developing and defending the people's democratic and free rights. We firmly believe that with the joint efforts of legal workers in Asian countries and the care and support of peace-loving people in all countries, the conference will surely achieve complete success.

　　Long live the unity and cooperation of legal workers in Asian countries!

    祝贺亚洲法律工作者会议的胜利召开
    国际民主法律工作者协会副主席
    中国政治法律学会理事会副主席
    沈钧儒
    亚洲各国法律工作者长时期以来就有一个共同愿望：即能够聚首一堂，从法律的角度，来讨论与亚洲各个国家和人民的共同利益有关的各项问题，并促进各国法律工作者的友好合作。亚洲各国法律工作者对此曾有过长时期的酝酿。一九五四年一月，在国际民主法律工作者协会理事会维也纳会议上，印度法律工作者的代表，曾提出拟在一九五四年底召开亚洲法律工作者会议的建议，这个建议获得亚洲各国法律工作者代表的热烈欢迎，及国际民主法律工作者协会的支持和赞助。此后，有关各国的法律工作者团体和法学家，就召开亚洲法律工作者会议一事，进行了广泛的接触和联系。一九五四年九月，在全印民主法律工作者协会成立大会上，曾通过决议，建议在加尔各答召开亚洲法律工作者会议。同年十二月，全印民主法协向亚洲及其邻近国家的法律工作者团体及法学家们发出邀请书，亚洲法律工作者会议订于一九五五年一月二十五日起在加尔各答举行。亚洲及其邻近国家的法律工作者均以极大的热诚，准备派遣代表出席会议。中国政治法律学会也已组成以学会理事会副主席张志让为团长、学会秘书长朱其文为副团长的代表团，前往加尔各答出席会议。
    亚洲法律工作者当前所面临的形势是：一方面，亚洲各国人民的觉醒日益提高，争取和维护民族独立、国家主权的意志和力量日益高涨，保卫亚洲和世界和平的信心日益增强，和平运动空前壮大，争取和发展人民的民主自由的努力更加扩大与深入。中印、中缅总理声明中所倡导的和平共处五项原则，获得了各国人民——特别是亚洲人民的普遍欢迎和热烈拥护，它向亚洲以及世界各个国家昭示了友好合作、以促进共同繁荣和发展的光明前景。而另一方面：以美国侵略集团为首的帝国主义好战分子，却拚命地在亚洲制造紧张局势。在日内瓦会议获得亚洲局势一定程度的和缓之后，立即签订了马尼拉侵略协定；最近，又勾结蒋介石卖国集团签订美蒋条约，妄图长期霸占台湾，作为发动战争、侵略中国大陆的跳板；疯狂叫嚣原子战争，不断在太平洋上进行原子武器的试验，积极追求在太平洋岛屿建立原子轰炸基地。这些战争准备，严重地威胁着亚洲以及世界的和平与安全。美帝国主义者妄想以战争威胁来压制亚洲各国人民独立与自由的热切愿望，希图保持和恢复其在亚洲的殖民主义统治，阻止亚洲各国人民求取繁荣与进步的努力，扼杀争取民主自由权利的斗争，以达其永久剥削与奴役亚洲广大人民的狂妄目的。这就使得亚洲各国法律工作者更迫切需要团结起来，和各国爱好和平与自由的人民一道，来制止帝国主义好战分子准备新战争的威胁，以保卫共同的和平与安全，争取和维护主权独立与民主自由。
    因此，亚洲法律工作者会议于此时召开，就更具有其重大的意义。它是亚洲各国的法律工作者团结合作的良好开端，将在维护民族独立、国家主权，维护亚洲和世界和平与安全，发展和保卫人民的民主自由权利的事业上，作出有益的贡献。我们深信：在亚洲各国法律工作者的共同努力，和各国爱好和平人民的关怀与支持下，会议必将获得圆满的成功。
    亚洲各国的法律工作者团结合作万岁！
