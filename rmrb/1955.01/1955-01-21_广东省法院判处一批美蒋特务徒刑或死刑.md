Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 20th: The Guangdong Provincial Higher People's Court sentenced four groups of armed spies on the 11th, who were airdropped into Guangdong Province by the United States and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek in 1952 and subsequently captured by our forces.

These airdropped armed spies totaled sixty. Besides two who surrendered and twenty-one captured alive, the rest were killed in action. The American weapons, radios, ammunition, maps, parachutes, etc., they carried were all seized by us.

These airdropped spies were transported aboard American aircraft and personally escorted by Americans. Among them, one group was dispatched by the so-called "Headquarters of the Free China Movement" belonging to the Central Intelligence Agency of the American spy organization, headed by the bandit Cai Wenzhi and led by Hua Bingyue, consisting of four armed spies. They flew from Tokyo aboard an American aircraft piloted by an American pilot to Okinawa first, and then took off from Okinawa, landing in the northern Guangdong area at 3:00 AM on April 14, 1952. Another group was four spies led by the bandit Qiu Zhongzhi, who parachuted into the eastern Guangdong area on the night of April 15, 1952, after flying from Taoyuan Airport in Taipei aboard an American aircraft piloted by an American. The other two groups, consisting of fifty-two spies headed by Zhu Guanzhou, Xie Qiang, Li Jizao, Liu Zhenhan, etc., under the escort of American spies, flew from Taoyuan Airport in Taipei aboard American aircraft on May 11 and July 9, 1952, respectively, sneaking into the airspace of Danxian, Yaxian, Baisha, and Ding'an counties on Hainan Island and parachuting down.

Most of these spies were professional spies who were resolutely hostile to the people. Among them, Liu Zhenhan had murdered twenty-three of our revolutionary cadres, and Xie Qiang had murdered eighteen people and revolutionary workers. These blood-soaked spy bandits had received special agent training at the "Free China Movement Military and Political Cadre School" and the "Free China Movement Operations School" sponsored by American imperialism on Saipan Island and in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, and some had received special agent training at the bandit "Guerrilla Cadre Training Class of the Ministry of National Defense" hosted by American spies in Taiwan. They were sent to the mainland of our country to attempt to establish "guerrilla bases," organize "anti-Communist guerrilla teams," expand spy organizations, gather military and political intelligence, and carry out armed riots to prepare for the American aggressors to launch a war of aggression against our country.

The Criminal Tribunal of the Guangdong Provincial Higher People's Court, in addition to releasing the two spies who surrendered, sentenced the remaining ten airdropped spies to fixed-term imprisonment and life imprisonment, and sentenced the arch-criminals Hua Bingyue, Qiu Zhongzhi, Zhu Guanzhou, Li Jizao and other eleven spy bandits to death.

    广东省法院判处一批美蒋特务徒刑或死刑
    【新华社广州二十日电】广东省高级人民法院在十一日判决了曾在一九五二年由美国及其走狗蒋介石派飞机空投在广东省境内而被我捕获的四批武装特务。
    这些空投武装特务共有六十名，除投诚两名、活捉二十一名外，其余全被击毙。他们携带的美国武器、电台、弹药、地图、降落伞等都被我缴获。
    这些空投特务是乘坐美国飞机并由美国人亲自护送的。其中一批是由美国间谍机关中央情报局所属的以蔡匪文治为首的所谓“自由中国运动总部”派遣、由华犯秉钺率领的武装特务四名，他们从东京乘美国驾驶员驾驶的美国飞机先飞到冲绳岛，然后由冲绳岛起飞，一九五二年四月十四日早晨三时在粤北地区上空降落；一批是丘犯中直率领的四名特务，在一九五二年四月十五日晚上从台北桃园机场乘美国人驾驶的美国飞机偷入我粤东地区上空跳伞降落；另外两批是以朱冠周、谢强、李积藻、刘振汉等为首的五十二名特务，在美国间谍分子护送下，在一九五二年五月十一日和七月九日，先后从台北桃园机场乘美国飞机偷入我海南岛的儋县、崖县、白沙、定安等县上空降落。
    这些特务大多是坚决与人民为敌的职业特务。其中，刘犯振汉曾杀害我革命干部二十三名，谢犯强曾杀害群众和革命工作人员十八名。这些血债累累的特务匪徒有的曾在塞班岛、日本神奈川县美帝国主义主办的“自由中国运动军政干部学校”和“自由中国运动作战学校”受过特务训练，有的曾在台湾美国间谍主持的匪“国防部游击干部训练班”受过特务训练。他们被派遣到我国大陆的目的是企图建立“游击根据地”，组织“反共游击队”，扩大特务组织，刺探军政情报，进行武装暴动，为美国侵略者对我国进行侵略战争作准备。
    广东省高级人民法院刑事审判庭除释放投诚的两名特务外，分别对其余的十名空投特务判处有期徒刑和无期徒刑，对华秉钺、丘中直、朱冠周、李积藻等十一名罪大恶极的特务匪徒判处死刑。
