Workers Welcome the Rapid Pictorial Drawing Method

Professor Zhao Xuetian of the Huazhong Institute of Technology created the "Rapid Pictorial Drawing Method for Mechanical Workers." After a year of focused teaching experiments, the results have been very good and warmly welcomed by workers. In Wuhan, more than 400 workers who previously could not understand blueprints have learned to read three-view drawings, sectional views, part drawings, and simple assembly drawings after only 20 hours of lectures, review, and discussion, and can construct according to the drawings. As a result, rework and waste in their production have been greatly reduced.

Reading blueprints is a basic skill that mechanical workers must possess. In the past, it often took several years to train a worker who could understand drawings. However, Professor Zhao Xuetian's "Rapid Pictorial Drawing Method for Mechanical Workers" uses the principle of overhead projection and appropriately employs wall charts and models to help workers establish a three-dimensional concept of reading drawings, enabling them to learn to read drawings within 20 hours. At the end of the first training class at the Wuchang Vehicle Factory, the workers presented Professor Zhao Xuetian with a silk banner: "You have given us the key to finding the knack." According to preliminary statistics, 120 factories, 33 professional bureaus, and 21 industrial schools and training classes have requested the "Rapid Pictorial Drawing Method for Mechanical Workers" teaching materials from the Wuhan Science and Technology Popularization Association.

Recently, the Wuhan Municipal Cultural and Educational Committee awarded Professor Zhao Xuetian a bonus of five million yuan. The National Science and Technology Popularization Association is preparing to publish teaching materials to promote the "Rapid Pictorial Drawing Method for Mechanical Workers."

    工人欢迎速成看图法
    华中工学院赵学田教授创造的“机械工人速成看图法”，经过一年来的重点教学试验，效果很好，受到工人热烈欢迎。武汉市已有四百多名原来看不懂蓝图的工人，只经过二十小时的听课和复习讨论，就学会了看三面图、剖面图、零件图和简单的装配图，并能按图施工。他们生产上的返工废活也因此大大减少。
    看图纸是机械工人必须具备的基本知识，过去培养一个能看懂图纸的工人往往需要几年时间，而赵学田教授创造的“机械工人速成看图法”运用实物投影的原理，适当采用挂图和模型帮助工人建立看图的立体观念，使工人能在二十小时内学会看图。武昌车辆厂第一期训练班结束时，工人们赠给赵学田教授一面锦旗：“您授给了我们找窍门的钥匙”。据初步统计，各地向武汉市科学技术普及协会索取“机械工人速成看图法”教材的已有一百二十个工厂、三十三个专业局、二十一个工业学校和训练班。
    最近武汉市文化教育委员会赠给赵学田教授五百万元奖金。全国科学技术普及协会为了推广“机械工人速成看图法”，正准备出版教材。
