Newly Built Southwest Locomotive Repair Factory
Overhauls First Locomotive
    The newly built Chengdu Locomotive Repair Factory in the Southwest began temporary production on December 1st of last year and overhauled its first locomotive for the Baoji-Chengdu Railway on December 29th. Previously, there were no specialized locomotive repair factories in the Southwest. When locomotives needed major or intermediate repairs, they could only be patched up at the locomotive depots, resulting in poor repair quality and efficiency, which affected locomotive operation. The newly built repair factory will not only undertake the major and intermediate repairs of locomotives on the Chengdu-Chongqing and Baoji-Chengdu Railways, but will also be responsible for the major task of repairing locomotives on the Chengdu-Kunming Railway and providing partial locomotive parts for the Lanzhou-Xinjiang and Longhai Railways in the future.

    西南新建机车修理厂
    检修出第一台机车
    西南新建成都机车修理工厂，于去年十二月一日开始临时生产，并在十二月二十九日为宝成铁路检修出第一台机车。从前西南没有专门修理机车的工厂，机车运用到大修或中修的时候，只能在机务段凑合修理，修理的质量和效率不高，影响机车的运用。现在新建的修理工厂不仅能作成渝、宝成两铁路机车的大修、中修工作，而且将来还要担负起修成昆铁路机车及兰新路、陇海路的部分机车配件等重大任务。
