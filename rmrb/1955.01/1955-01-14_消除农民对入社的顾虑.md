    Eliminating Farmers' Concerns About Joining Cooperatives
    Since the beginning of winter, the phenomenon of farmers selling their draught animals has been quite common in some areas of Shaanxi Province. For example, in the Shi Wang Village area of Jingyang County, the number of people selling draught animals has increased three to four times compared to previous years, while the number of people buying draught animals is particularly small. The price of draught animals on the market has also fallen significantly. Mules and horses that could previously be sold for over 10 million yuan have fallen to a maximum of 8 to 9 million yuan; the price of a cow has fallen by about 500,000 to 600,000 yuan compared to before. The price of draught animals in some parts of Xianyang County has also fallen by a third. The Shaanxi Daily keenly noticed this abnormal phenomenon and pointed out that the main reason for this phenomenon is that some farmers have an incorrect understanding of joining agricultural production cooperatives and have the idea of being afraid of suffering losses and "grabbing a handful now." They are concerned that when they join the cooperative later, the draught animals will be undervalued, or they will not be able to get the money for a while. Some farmers, on the other hand, have the idea of relying on others. They think that after joining the cooperative, they can rely on everyone for everything, and it doesn't matter if they sell their animals. In analyzing these ideological concerns of farmers, the Shaanxi Daily also emphasized that this is due to the farmers' lack of understanding of the cooperative's regulations and their lack of correct understanding of the consistency of the cooperative's interests and their own interests.
    In response to the above situation, the Shaanxi Daily promptly conducted in-depth publicity and explanation to the farmers. On November 11th last year, the Shaanxi Daily used a question-and-answer format, inviting Liu Demao, director of the Shi Wang Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jingyang County, and Yan Yuxing, leader of the cooperative's technical research group, to use their own experiences and some vivid local examples to eliminate the farmers' fear of losing out on draught animals entering the cooperative and the idea of "grabbing a handful now." For example, in their answers, they said that selling draught animals now will cause economic losses to oneself, regardless of whether one can join the cooperative or not; especially for those who are about to join the cooperative, selling draught animals will not only cause losses to oneself but also to the entire cooperative. Last spring, the Shi Wang Village Agricultural Production Cooperative was delayed in sowing corn because there was too much land and too few draught animals. Later, although they borrowed draught animals from other agricultural production cooperatives to sow the seeds, the delay of a few days in sowing caused the 64 mu of corn to produce less grain and less income by more than 2 million yuan, which was almost equivalent to losing a draught cow for nothing. Several other mutual aid team members in Shi Wang Village who wanted to join the cooperative learned this lesson and not only stopped selling draught animals in winter, but some people also replaced the old and weak ones with strong ones.
    After explaining to the farmers that the principle of draught animals joining the cooperative would never cause personal losses, the newspaper suggested that rural work cadres should pay attention to explaining the cooperative's regulations to the farmers, especially the issue of draught animals and farm tools joining the cooperative, in order to eliminate the farmers' concerns.
    The Shaanxi Daily's publicity on the issue of farmers selling draught animals shows that newspapers should start from the specific problems in the local cooperative construction work at that time, keenly pay attention to the ideological trends and changes in the economic life of farmers, in order to deepen the publicity for the great development of agricultural production cooperatives.

    消除农民对入社的顾虑
    入冬以来，陕西省有些地区农民出卖耕畜的现象相当普遍。如泾阳县史王村一带，卖耕畜的人比往年多了三、四倍，买耕畜的人却特别少。市上耕畜的价钱也跌落了很多。前些时候能卖一千多万元的骡、马，跌到顶多能卖八、九百万元；一头牛的价钱大约比前些时候要跌落五、六十万元。咸阳县有些地方的耕畜价钱也跌落了三分之一。陕西日报敏锐地注意到这种不正常现象，并指出形成这种现象的主要原因，是有些农民对加入农业生产合作社有不正确的认识，存在着怕吃亏、“现抓一把”的思想。他们顾虑以后入社时，耕畜折价小，或一时拿不到钱。有些农民则抱着依赖别人的思想。他们想入了社遇事靠大家，自己的牲口卖了也不要紧。陕西日报在分析农民这些思想顾虑时，还着重指出：这是由于农民对于入社的章程了解不够，对于社的利益和自己利益的一致性缺乏正确的理解。
    陕西日报针对上述情况及时向农民进行了深入的宣传解释。去年十一月十一日陕西日报用问答形式，请泾阳县史王村农业生产合作社主任刘德茂和合作社的技术研究组组长阎玉兴用他们自己的体验和当地的一些生动事例，来消除农民怕耕畜入社吃亏和“现抓一把”的思想。例如他们在回答中说，现在卖掉耕畜，不论自己能够入社或不能入社，都会使自己受到经济上的损失；特别是将要入社的人，要是卖掉耕畜，不仅会使自己而且会使全社都受到损失。史王村农业生产合作社去年春上就是因为地多耕畜少，耽误了玉米的播种，后来虽然借别的农业生产合作社的耕畜下了种，但因迟种了几天，就使六十四亩多玉米少打粮食少收入二百多万元，差不多等于白白丢掉了一条耕牛。史王村其他几户要参加社的互助组员接受了这个教训，到冬季不仅不再出卖耕畜了，有些人还把老弱的变换成强壮的。
    在向农民讲清耕畜入社绝不会使个人吃亏的道理后，报纸建议农村工作干部，要注意向农民讲清社里的章程，特别是关于耕畜、农具入社的问题，以消除农民的顾虑。
    陕西日报对于农民出卖耕畜问题的宣传，说明报纸应该从当时当地建社工作中的具体问题出发，锐敏地注意农民的思想动向和经济生活上的变化，以深入对农业生产合作社大发展的宣传。
