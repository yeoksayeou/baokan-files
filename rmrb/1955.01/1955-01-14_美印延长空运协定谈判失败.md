Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 13th: According to a public statement released by the Indian government on the 11th, negotiations between the Indian and US governments in New Delhi concerning the extension of the US-India air transport agreement have failed. The agreement, signed in 1946, will expire on the 15th of this month.

The original US-India agreement was unfavorable to India and hindered the development of Indian International Airways. This is because, according to the agreement, the operations of American airlines in India were not subject to the control of the Indian government. It is reported that the Indian government hoped to revise the agreement during the negotiations. It insisted on its right to control the number of flights and the carrying capacity of foreign aircraft flying in Indian airspace. However, the US government opposed this request, even though agreements signed by India with other countries recognize this right.

    美印延长空运协定谈判失败
    【新华社新德里十三日电】据印度政府十一日发表的公报宣布，由于印度政府和美国政府间最近在新德里举行的关于延长美印空运协定的谈判失败，这个在一九四六年签订的协定将在本月十五日满期。
    原来的美印协定是对印度不利的，它妨碍印度国际航空公司的发展。因为根据这个协定，美国航空公司在印度的业务不受印度政府的控制。据报道，印度政府在谈判过程中希望修改这个协定。它坚持它有权控制在印度领空飞行的外国飞机的飞行次数和载运量。但是美国政府反对这个要求，虽然印度和其他国家签订的协定是承认这种权利的。
