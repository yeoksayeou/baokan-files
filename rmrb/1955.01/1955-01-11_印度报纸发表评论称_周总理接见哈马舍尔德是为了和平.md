Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 10th: The Indian press has widely commented on the meeting between United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld and Premier Zhou Enlai in Beijing. The "India" weekly said on the 1st: Premier Zhou Enlai's reception of Hammarskjöld was for peace. "If China had refused to receive Hammarskjöld, who came to Beijing with a one-sided resolution (by the UN General Assembly regarding the American spies), no one could have blamed China, but China's acceptance of talks with him is another great diplomatic victory, defeating those countries that want to isolate China."

    The "Indian Express" said on the 4th: If Hammarskjöld's mission is to act according to the UN's one-sided resolution, "the chances of success are very small."

    Some newspapers pointed out that the argument of the United States and its supporters that the American spies wearing military uniforms proves that they are not spies is untenable. The United States falsely accuses China of violating the Korean Armistice Agreement by sentencing American spies, while the United States itself, by sending tens of thousands of Chinese prisoners of war to Taiwan, is the real violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement. The "Deccan Herald" said: "Saying that those wearing military uniforms are not spies is naive." "The Leader" said: "The United States threatens to take drastic action to force China to release American airmen. The United States is so sympathetic to these eleven people, but does not find it worthwhile to sympathize with the eight million non-Europeans in South Africa, and as for the Korean prisoners of war issue, it is the United States that is violating the armistice agreement." "The Assam Tribune" said: "The United Nations is excessively enthusiastic about the American airmen issue, but ignores the sending of tens of thousands of Chinese prisoners of war to Taiwan; the United Nations is controlled by one country."

    印度报纸发表评论称
    周总理接见哈马舍尔德是为了和平
    【新华社新德里十日电】　印度报界对联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德到北京同周恩来总理会谈一事广泛发表了评论。“印度”周刊一日说：周恩来总理接见哈马舍尔德是为了和平。“如果中国拒绝接见带着（联合国大会关于美国间谍的）片面决议到北京去的哈马舍尔德，没有人能够怪中国，但是中国接受与他会谈是赢得了另一个外交上的大胜利，击败了那些想要孤立中国的国家。”
    “印度快报”四日说：如果哈马舍尔德的任务是按联合国的片面决议办事，“那成功的希望是很小的”。
    一些报纸指出，美国及其附和者硬说美国间谍穿着军服就证明他们不是间谍的论调是站不住脚的。美国诬指中国判处美国间谍是所谓违背朝鲜停战协定，而美国自己把成万名中国战俘送到台湾去才是真正破坏了朝鲜停战协定。“德康先驱报”说：“说穿军服的不是间谍是幼稚的。”“领导者报” 说：“美国威胁要采取激烈行动迫使中国释放美国航空员。美国对这十一个人如此同情，而对八百万南非的非欧洲人却觉得不值得同情，至于说到朝鲜战俘问题却是美国破坏停战协定。”“阿萨姆论坛报”说：“联合国对美国航空员的问题热心过火，而对成万中国战俘送到台湾却置之不理，联合国受一个国家的控制。”
