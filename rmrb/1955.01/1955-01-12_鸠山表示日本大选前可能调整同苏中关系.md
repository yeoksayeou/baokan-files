Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 11th: Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama, while campaigning in Osaka on the 11th, stated that the Japanese government may take steps to adjust relations between Japan and the Soviet Union and China before the general election. The Japanese general election will be held no later than early March.

At a press conference, Hatoyama Ichiro said, "It is reasonable for Japan to want to normalize its relations with the Soviet Union and Communist China. By normalization, I mean ending the state of war." He said, "Japan should take the initiative to send appeals to these countries. There should be such an opportunity before the general election."

Hatoyama Ichiro said that what he believes in is "a diplomatic policy that will definitely end the antagonistic position that is still in a state of war." He went on to explain: "I do not mean to ignore the United States in this regard. If I explain it, I don't think the United States will be anxious."

    鸠山表示日本大选前可能调整同苏中关系
    【新华社十一日讯】东京消息：日本首相鸠山一郎十一日在竞选途中在大阪发表谈话表示：日本政府可能在大选以前采取调整日本和苏联、中国的关系的步骤。日本大选至迟将在三月初举行。
    鸠山一郎在记者招待会上说：“日本想要使它同苏联和共产党中国的关系正常化，是合理的。所谓正常化，我指的是结束战争状态。”他说：“日本应当采取主动，向这些国家发出呼吁。在大选以前应当会有这样一个机会。”
    鸠山一郎说：他所相信的是“一个将能肯定地结束仍然处于战争状态这样一种对立地位的外交政策”。他接着解释说：“我的意思并不是要在这方面忽视美国。如果我进行解释的话，我想美国不会焦心的。”
