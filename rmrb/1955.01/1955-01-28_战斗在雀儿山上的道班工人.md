    Road Maintenance Workers Fighting on Que'er Mountain
    Wu Wei
    "Speaking of Que'er Mountain,
    Few have lived here since ancient times,
    Even birds find it hard to reach the summit,
    And snow never ceases year-round."
    This is how the advancing troops described Que'er Mountain.

    Que'er Mountain is the highest mountain along the Kangzang Highway, with an elevation of over 5,000 meters, and the harsh climate is constantly changing. When the road-building troops were constructing the highway here, they not only endured untold hardships, but some soldiers also gave their precious lives. Now, although the highway has been built, the struggle against nature has not stopped. In order to ensure that trucks loaded with supplies can reach Tibet smoothly, hundreds of road maintenance workers stationed on Que'er Mountain are heroically fighting against various natural disasters day and night.

    On Que'er Mountain, the biggest threats to the highway are snow and ice. Winter comes particularly early on Que'er Mountain; after July and August, it becomes a completely silver mountain. In just a few hours, heavy snow can bury the road. At this time, the road maintenance workers take shovels to clear the snow on the road and the snowslides from the mountains, spread sand, and allow vehicles to pass. In the severe cold of around minus thirty degrees Celsius, if you take iron tools without gloves, your hands will immediately stick to the iron, and tearing them away will tear off the skin and flesh. In winter, many culverts on the mountain are frozen, blocking the flow of water, which then overflows the road surface and freezes, making the highway hard and slippery. To prevent the danger of driving, the workers drill into the cramped culverts and break the ice with hammers. The heat from their bodies melts the ice and snow, and cold water soaks their entire bodies. When they come out of the culvert and are blown by the wind, their whole bodies immediately freeze into solid ice.

    During the short summer, it rains all day on the mountain, and with some snow melting, loose rocks can collapse and block the highway at any time with landslides and rockfalls. These stones range in size from tables to larger than houses. The workers check the route day and night, and immediately run to repair the road at the risk of their lives when they find a collapse. In August last year, 3,000 cubic meters collapsed at kilometer 66 on the mountain in one instance. These stones would require at least 600 five-ton trucks to transport completely. But the workers came up with a solution: they dammed the river next to the road and used the rapid currents to wash away rubble and sediment, and then blasted the large stones and pushed them off the cliff. The highway was cleared again in just two days.

    Here, there are many difficulties that people living inland would never expect. When the workers first arrived on the mountain, even the strongest felt dizzy, weak, and swollen in the face. The weaker ones would suddenly faint while walking on the road. When they started working, they would be out of breath after only a few minutes. Sometimes, gales raged on the mountain, and snowflakes filled the air, making it impossible to see your fingers. The cold air pierced the bones. At this time, the workers would rest for a while and continue working when the wind weakened slightly. In winter, the mountain springs and rivers freeze, and the workers carry baskets of snow and ice to boil water for drinking. It is in this environment that many workers have lived on the mountain for three whole years. I asked them how they were living, and they said, "We are used to it, and we are very happy."

    The workers' lives are indeed very happy, because they know that their work is for the Tibetan people, the people of the whole country, and for socialist construction. On the construction site, the sounds of clapper talk shows from the loudspeakers, the workers' mutual calls, and songs are connected into one, and the frozen snow-capped mountains are filled with the vitality of spring. In the arduous struggle, the workers have also made many innovations. For example, for drilling blasting holes, it used to take two workers. Now, the workers have created the "pressure detonation method" and the "pressure stone blasting method," which can blast without drilling holes, saving one worker and doubling the work efficiency. Repairing the road surface in the summer is the most intense work of the year, because the mountain road surface can only emerge from under the snow for two months a year. At this time, the workers think of ways to improve work efficiency, generally exceeding the quota by 50 percent. Listen to the workers' bold words: "The mountain may block the road, but we won't be stopped. We will show our heroism on Que'er Mountain!"

    The hard work of the hundreds of road maintenance workers on Que'er Mountain has brought happiness to the Tibetan people. When people pass through Que'er Mountain, they all pay high respect to the heroes.

    战斗在雀儿山上的道班工人
    吴畏
    “提起雀儿山，
    自古少人烟，
    飞鸟也难上山顶，
    终年雪不断。”
    这是进藏部队对于雀儿山的形容。
    雀儿山是康藏公路沿线最高的一座山，海拔五千多公尺，恶劣的气候变幻无常。当年筑路部队在这里修筑公路时，不但历经千辛万苦，而且有的战士还付出了宝贵的生命。现在，虽然公路已经修成了，但是和大自然的斗争并没有停止。为了保证满载着物资的汽车能顺利地到达西藏，驻守在雀儿山的数百名道班工人，日日夜夜地对各种自然灾害进行着英勇的斗争。
    在雀儿山上，对于公路威胁最大的是积雪和冰冻。雀儿山上的冬天来得特别早，七、八月后它就完全成了一座银山。只消几小时工夫，漫天的大雪便会把道路淹没。这时，道班工人就拿着铁锹铲去路上的积雪和山上坍下来的雪方，铺上泥沙，让汽车能够通过。在零下三十度左右的严寒里，如果不戴手套去拿铁器，马上手就会和铁粘在一起，一扯就把皮肉撕下来了。冬天，山上的许多涵洞都结了冰，阻塞了水流的去路，这样水便会溢出路面，结了冰，使公路又硬又滑。为了防止行车的危险，工人们便钻进仅能容身的涵洞里去，用铁锤把冰块打破。他们身上的热气把冰雪溶化了，冷水就浸透了全身，出得洞来被风一吹，浑身上下马上又结成了一块一块的硬冰。
    在短暂的夏季里，山上终日下着大雨，加上部分积雪溶化，疏松的岩石随时都会山崩地裂地坍下来阻塞着公路。这些石头，小的有桌子那样大，大的比一幢房子还要大。工人们日夜查看着路线，发现那里坍方便立刻跑去，冒险抢修。去年八月间，山上六十六公里处，一次就坍了三千方。这些石头，至少需要六百辆载重五吨的大卡车才能运完。但是工人们想出了办法：他们把路旁的河水拦起来，利用急流冲走碎石和泥沙，再把大的石头爆炸开，掀下岩去。仅仅两天公路又畅通了。
    在这里，还有许多生活在内地的人们所意想不到的困难。当工人们初到山上的时候，身体最强壮的人都感到头晕、身上软，脸发肿，身体较弱的走在路上就会突然晕倒，工作起来，只要几分钟就累得喘不过气。有时山上狂风大作，空中雪花弥漫，使人伸手不辨五指，寒气直刺骨髓。这时工人们便休息一下，等到风势稍弱又继续工作。到了冬天，山上的泉水和河水都结成了冰，工人们便扛着一篓篓积雪和冰块来烧水吃。就是在这样的环境里，许多工人已经在山上住了整整三个年头。我问他们生活得怎样，他们说：“我们习惯了，我们很快活。”
    工人们的生活的确是很愉快的，因为他们知道他们的工作是为了藏族人民、全国人民，为了社会主义建设。在工地上，广播筒里传出的快板声、工人们互相的呼唤声、歌声连成了一片，封冻的雪山上洋溢着春日的生气。在艰苦的斗争中，工人们还有许多创造。比如打炮眼，过去需要两个人工，现在，工人们创造了“压引法”和“压石爆炸法”，可以不打炮眼就爆炸，节约了一个人工，并且使工作效率提高了一倍。夏季抢修路面是一年中最紧张的工作，因为山上的路面一年只能从积雪下出现两个月。这时工人们便想法提高工作效率，普遍都超过了定额百分之五十。请听工人们的豪语：“山封路不封，雀儿山上逞英雄！”
    雀儿山上的数百名道班工人的辛勤劳动，给藏族人民带来了幸福。当人们经过雀儿山时，无不向英雄们致以崇高的敬意。
