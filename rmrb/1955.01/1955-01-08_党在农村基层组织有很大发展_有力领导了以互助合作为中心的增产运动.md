(Xinhua News Agency, 7th) With the socialist transformation of agriculture, the organization of the Communist Party of China in rural areas has greatly developed. Currently, 70 percent of townships across the country have established Communist Party branches.

In the rural areas of the old liberated areas, Party grassroots organizations have been established in all but a few villages; in the rural areas of the later liberated areas, the townships with Party grassroots organizations established account for an average of more than 60 percent of the total number of townships. In Sichuan Province, which was liberated later, more than 21,000 advanced farmers joined the Communist Party in September and October of last year; the number of townships with established branches accounted for 90 percent of the total number of townships in the province. In Jiangsu Province, a total of more than 44,000 farmers joined the Communist Party from January to November last year, and more than 96 percent of townships in the province established Party grassroots organizations.

Party organizations have paid attention to strengthening leadership in Party building work. All localities have generally formulated plans for carrying out Party building work in rural areas, and Party building is being carried out in conjunction with various central tasks. All localities have followed the Party Central Committee's "active and prudent" Party building policy when admitting Party members. Last spring, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China paid attention to the planned development and consolidation of the Party's grassroots organizations in rural areas during regular production. By September, more than 5,000 advanced farmers in the province had been admitted to the Party. In order to strengthen leadership, Sichuan Province sent thousands of Party cadres to the countryside to assist rural branches in carrying out Party building work. At the same time as training backbone personnel for running cooperatives, Party organizations at all levels in Yunnan Province conducted communist education for more than 70,000 peasant activists. In addition, many regions have established a Party class system, absorbing peasant activists to attend Party classes and conduct regular education. In Tongliang County, Sichuan Province, there are more than 10,000 peasant activists attending Party classes, and 16 of the 60 peasant activists in Ciyun Township, Jiangjin County, who regularly attend Party classes have been admitted to the Party.

The newly admitted Party members are all outstanding individuals with socialist consciousness. Among the more than 44,000 new Party members newly admitted in Jiangsu Province, more than 5,150 are leading backbone personnel of agricultural production cooperatives, and more than 10,300 are leaders of mutual aid teams. Chen Yongkang, a national model for high rice yield and head of the Lianmin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province, has joined the Communist Party. Xu Jianchun, an agricultural high-yield model and outstanding graduate of senior primary school in Shandong Province, has also been admitted as a Communist Party member. As the strength of the Party has increased, it has powerfully promoted the agricultural production increase movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation in rural areas. By November last year, the Party's rural branches in Guizhou Province had led farmers of all ethnic groups in the province to establish 3,500 agricultural production cooperatives, which improved and developed more than 260,000 mutual aid teams. The branches also actively led farmers with the township people's government to improve technology and overcome various natural disasters, ensuring the province's increased grain production. Last year, Nonghe Township in Duan County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, developed nine new Party members and established a Communist Party branch. Under the leadership of the branch, Yao and Zhuang farmers in the township organized 58 mutual aid teams, and 89 percent of households were organized, promoting the development of production.

    党在农村基层组织有很大发展
    有力领导了以互助合作为中心的增产运动
    【新华社七日讯】随着农业的社会主义改造，中国共产党在农村中的组织有了很大发展。目前，全国已有百分之七十的乡建立了共产党的支部。
    在老解放区农村中，除个别的乡村外，都已建立起党的基层组织；在晚解放区农村中，建立党的基层组织的乡平均占总乡数的百分之六十以上。解放较晚的四川省，在去年九、十两个月间有二万一千多个先进农民参加了共产党；全省建立了支部的乡占总乡数的百分之九十。江苏省在去年一月到十一月期间参加共产党的农民共有四万四千多人，全省有百分之九十六以上的乡建立了党的基层组织。
    党的组织在建党工作中都注意了加强领导。各地普遍制订了在农村中进行建党工作的计划，结合各种中心工作进行建党。各地在接收党员时，都按照中共中央规定的“积极慎重”的建党方针来进行。去年春季，中共黑龙江省委员会就注意在常年生产中，有计划的发展和巩固党在农村中的基层组织，到九月止，全省接收了五千多个农民先进分子入党。四川省为了加强领导，曾派出了数以千计的党的干部深入乡村，协助农村支部进行建党工作。云南省各级党组织在训练办社骨干的同时，向七万多名农民积极分子进行了共产主义教育。此外，有不少地区建立了党课制度，吸收农民积极分子参加听党课，进行经常的教育。四川省铜梁县听党课的农民积极分子有一万多人，江津县慈云乡六十个经常听党课的农民积极分子中已有十六个被接收入党。
    被接收入党的新党员都是具有社会主义觉悟的优秀人物。江苏省新接收的四万四千多个新党员中，有五千一百五十多人是农业生产合作社的领导骨干，有一万零三百多人是互助组组长。全国水稻丰产模范、江苏省松江县联民农业生产合作社负责人陈永康已参加了共产党。山东省农业丰产模范、优秀的高小毕业生徐建春也已被接收为共产党员。由于党的力量的增强，就有力地推动了农村中以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动。贵州省到去年十一月为止，党的农村支部领导全省各族农民先后建立了三千五百个农业生产合作社，使二十六万多个互助组得到了提高和发展。支部还和乡人民政府积极领导农民改进技术，战胜各种自然灾害，保证了全省粮食的增产。广西省桂西僮族自治区都安县弄河乡在去年发展了九名新党员，建立了中共支部，全乡瑶、僮族农民在支部的领导下，组织了五十八个互助组，百分之八十九的农户组织起来，推动了生产的发展。
