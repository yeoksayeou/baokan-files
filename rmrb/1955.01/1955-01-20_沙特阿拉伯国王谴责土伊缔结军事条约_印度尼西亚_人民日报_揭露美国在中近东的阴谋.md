　　Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 19th: Saudi Arabian King Saud has notified the Arab League Secretariat that he condemns the military treaty that the Turkish and Iraqi governments have decided to conclude.

    The Charge d'Affaires of the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Egypt, Qiqri, said that the Saudi Arabian King's opinion would be sent to the governments of all countries participating in the Arab League.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 18th: The Indonesian "People's Daily" published a commentary on the 17th regarding the decision of the Turkish and Iraqi governments to conclude a military treaty, stating that the United States is exerting its utmost efforts to drag Arab countries into aggressive military alliances and to invade the Middle East to replace Britain's position. The United States is also conspiring to make the countries in this region join a encirclement aimed at the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

    The "People's Daily" pointed out that because the United States is intensifying its efforts to push Arab countries toward a new war, the upcoming Asian-African Conference is even more important. The road to human happiness is peace, not military alliances. This simple truth is the principle upon which the Asian-African Conference is based. The "People's Daily" concluded by saying that despite all the vicious means employed by the United States, the desire to defend peace will inevitably defeat the ambitions of those who want to launch a war.

    沙特阿拉伯国王谴责土伊缔结军事条约
    印度尼西亚“人民日报”揭露美国在中近东的阴谋
　  【新华社十九日讯】开罗消息：沙特阿拉伯国王沙特已经通知阿拉伯联盟秘书处说，他谴责土耳其和伊拉克政府决定要缔结的军事条约。
    沙特阿拉伯驻埃及大使馆临时代办齐克里说，沙特阿拉伯国王的意见将送交所有参加阿拉伯联盟的国家的政府。
　  【新华社雅加达十八日电】印度尼西亚“人民日报”十七日就土耳其和伊拉克政府决定缔结军事条约一事发表评论说，美国正竭力把阿拉伯国家拉入侵略性的军事联盟，并侵入中近东以取代英国的地位。美国还阴谋使这个地区的国家加入针对苏联和人民民主国家的包围圈。
    “人民日报”指出，由于美国加紧把阿拉伯国家推向新战争，将要举行的亚非会议就更加重要了。走向人类幸福的道路是和平，而不是军事联盟。这个简单的真理就是亚非会议所依据的原则。“人民日报”最后说，尽管美国施展了一切恶毒的手段，要保卫和平的愿望必将击败想发动战争的野心。
