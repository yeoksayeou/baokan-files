Our Lessons
Zhang Chen, Director of Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory

The Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory is one of the key projects aided by the Soviet Union in the reconstruction of our country. This project began surveying and design in 1950, and construction and production began simultaneously in July 1952. Now, all reconstruction and new construction projects have been basically completed, and various workshops have successively transitioned into production. In terms of production, new products such as rock drills, pneumatic picks, pneumatic drills, pneumatic shovels, and riveting machines have been successfully trial-produced based on Soviet product drawings and have begun to supply the needs of major mines, railways, and bridge construction units nationwide.

In the reconstruction work of more than two years, there have been many shortcomings, among which the biggest impact on production is that the various production preparations for the reconstruction and newly built workshops were unattended to for a long time, and only started to be prepared when the reconstruction or newly built workshops were about to be put into production or had already been put into production, which was too late.

First, let’s talk about the preparation of production personnel. Many of the equipment in our factory are supplied by the Soviet Union, with high precision and strict quality requirements for the products. According to this requirement, we should have started the allocation and training of skilled workers, technicians, and management cadres according to the design requirements when the reconstruction began. However, in this aspect, we had the idea of relying on the original Northeast Machinery No. 7 Factory to help us solve the problems and did not actively cultivate them. It was not until the workshops were about to be put into production that we transferred personnel from the original Northeast Machinery No. 7 Factory. Although the number of workers exceeded the number required by the design, the technical level was low. For example, according to the design requirements, the average technical level of workers in the factory should be 4.26, but now it only reaches 2.12. The average technical level of workers in major types of work such as milling, fitting, turning, and grinding is only about half of the design requirements. The quality and quantity of management cadres and technicians are also far from satisfactory. The departure of personnel for internships in the Soviet Union was also postponed by one year.

The preparation of raw materials and tools was also late. The mechanical assembly workshop is the main workshop of our factory, but after the start of work, some machines have been unable to start for a long time because the special cutting tools ordered have not arrived.

In a factory designed with Soviet assistance and provided with relevant technical design data—the program for the production activities of all employees—it is one of the most important preparations before the start of production to promptly organize all employees to study these materials so that they can understand and master the technology required by the design. However, we did not recognize this point. On the one hand, the preparation of production personnel was late, and on the other hand, the translated materials were sealed up. Before April of last year, in order to emphasize confidentiality, we did not dare to use them. Trial production of new products during the reconstruction process was originally a good condition for organizing employees to study technical design materials and improve their technical level, but we did not do so. The new products that were successfully trial-produced were all trial-produced using old methods. Although we once organized cadres at the section chief level and above to study after April last year, we did not persist. General cadres and employees did not know what the technical design materials contained. Some people criticized the leading cadres for "mystifying" the technical documents, while others complained: "Besides the new factory buildings and new equipment, I don't know what other characteristics there are?" Some workshop cadres also blindly believed that they could complete the production tasks without organizing production according to the design and that they could eventually reach the designed production capacity. It was not until the Soviet experts repeatedly pointed out that the root cause of all the chaos in production was the failure to follow the technical design data that we began to pay attention to and correct this mistake.

For these reasons, after the workshop equipment was installed, it was missing this and that, and it was delayed in transitioning to production. For example, after the tool workshop equipment was installed, personnel were temporarily assigned. Because these people had not studied the technical design in advance, they did not understand the production organization and technological process of the new workshop, and they were not familiar with all the work. They also found that many of the machines that had been inspected had not been test-run, and some machine tools were also missing accessories and tools. Therefore, the workshop was originally scheduled to be put into production on May 1st, but only one-tenth of the equipment was started on May 10th, and it was not fully started until one month later. After the heat treatment workshop equipment was installed, because the workers were not organized to learn new operating methods in advance, the workers could only quench with coal stoves and could not quench with electric furnaces with instrument automatic control and temperature regulation. Soviet experts were temporarily invited to give lectures and teach new technologies, and it was not put into production until half a year later.

Although the production organization of the workshop is arranged according to the specialized sections and assembly lines specified in the design, the principle of fixed machine, fixed person, and fixed job has not been implemented in actual production. In addition, the equipment load is unbalanced. Therefore, a large number of artificial phenomena of product parts crossing sections exist, production is uneven, and the production cycle is prolonged. For example, for the cylinder body parts of heavy rock drills, experts believe that if advanced production forms are organized according to the design requirements, the production cycle should be fifteen to sixteen days, but now it has been prolonged to three to four months. Therefore, product parts and components form a "big belly" in the production process, and turnover is not flexible. At the end of the month, workers are transferred and equipped, more beds are added, more shifts are implemented, and a comprehensive mobilization is carried out to make a breakthrough.

Due to the lack of certain tools and fixtures, and also because some workers have poor labor discipline, things often happen where production is not carried out according to operating procedures. As a result, product quality is not guaranteed, and machine tool accidents occur constantly. Especially in the third quarter, there were as many as sixty-five accidents (a small part of which were due to power outages), which seriously damaged the precision machine tool equipment.

The lack of experience in capital construction and production preparation is the main reason for the above shortcomings and errors. The reconstruction work of our entire factory lacks an overall plan, and the order in which the workshops are put into production is also unreasonable. In the mechanical industry, the tool workshop should generally be put into production first in order to prepare tools and fixtures for the production workshop, but in our factory, the mechanical assembly workshop was put into production before the tool workshop. However, our factory has many experienced Soviet experts. If we are not satisfied with our existing set of experiences and some achievements in the trial production of new products, and do not think that we can organize the production of new enterprises with past experiences and methods, but honestly learn from the Soviet Union and listen to the experts more, then the situation will be much better. When summarizing this work now, we hope that people who are building new factories will not follow our path again.

    我们的教训
    沈阳风动工具厂厂长　张忱
    沈阳风动工具厂是苏联帮助我国改建的重点工程之一。这项工程在一九五○年开始勘察设计，一九五二年七月开始一面施工，一面生产。到现在，全部改建和新建工程已经基本结束，各个车间已先后转入生产；在生产方面，也已根据苏联的产品图纸，试制成功了凿岩机、风镐、风钻、风铲、铆钉机等新产品，并开始供应全国主要矿山、铁路和桥梁建造等单位的需要。
    在两年多的改建工作中，有许多缺点，其中对生产影响最大的就是改建和新建车间的各种生产准备工作长期处于无人过问状态，直到改建或新建车间快投入生产或已投入生产的时候才着手准备，实在是太晚了。
    先说生产人员的准备。我们厂里的许多设备，都是苏联供给的，精密度高，产品的质量要求也很严格。根据这个要求，应该在开始改建的时候，就按照设计的要求，着手调配和培养技术工人、技术人员和管理干部。但是在这一方面，我们有依赖原东北机械第七厂帮我们解决问题的思想，不积极培养，直到快投入生产的时候，才从原东北机械第七厂调配人员。工人数量虽然超过设计要求的人数，但技术水平低。例如按设计要求，全厂工人的平均技术等级应该是四点二六级，而现在只达到二点一二级，铣工、钳工、车工和磨工等主要工种工人的平均技术等级，也只达到设计要求的一半左右。管理干部和技术人员的质量和数量也差得很远。到苏联实习的人员，出国时间也推迟了一年。
    原材料和工具的准备也晚了。机械装配车间是我们工厂的主要车间，但开工以后，有些机器都因为特殊刃具的订货没到而长期不能开动。
    在苏联帮助设计并供给有关技术设计资料——全体职工生产活动的纲领——的工厂里，及时地组织全体职工学习这些资料，以便他们领会和掌握设计要求的技术，这是开工生产前的最重要的准备工作之一。但我们没有认识这一点，一方面生产人员准备晚了，另一方面又把翻译好的资料封存起来，去年四月以前为了强调保密，不敢拿来使用。在改建过程中试制新产品，本来是组织职工学习技术设计资料，提高职工的技术水平的良好条件，但我们没有这样做，试制成功的新产品都是用旧方法试制的。去年四月以后虽一度组织科长级以上干部学习，但也没有坚持下去。一般干部和职工不知道技术设计资料有那些内容。有人批评领导干部把技术文件“神秘化”起来了，有人则发牢骚说：“除了新厂房和新设备以外，不知道还有那些特点？”有的车间干部也盲目地认为不按设计组织生产也一样可以完成生产任务，并且最后也能达到设计能力的产量数字。直到苏联专家再三指出生产中一切混乱的根源是没有照技术设计资料办事以后，我们才开始重视和纠正这个错误。
    因这些缘故，车间设备安装好后，缺这缺那，迟迟不能转入生产。例如工具车间设备安装好以后，才临时配备人员。这些人因为事先没有学习技术设计，不了解新车间的生产组织和工艺过程，对一切工作都不熟悉，并且发现许多经过验收的机器都没有试过车，有些机床还缺少附件和工具。因此，这个车间原定五月一日投入生产，但到五月十日才开动十分之一的设备，一个月之后才全部开工。热处理车间设备安装好后，因事先没有组织工人学习新的操作方法，工人只能用煤炉淬火，而不能用有仪表自动控制和调节炉温的电炉淬火，临时才请苏联专家讲课传授新技术，半年以后才投入生产。
    车间的生产组织，虽然是按照设计规定的专业工段和流水作业线加以安排的，但在实际生产中没有贯彻定机、定人、定活的原则，加上设备负荷不平衡，所以，人为的产品部件跨工段现象大量存在，生产不均衡，生产循环期拖长了。例如：重型凿岩机缸体部件，专家认为：如果按照设计要求组织先进的生产形式，生产循环期应为十五到十六天，但现在却拖长到三、四个月之久。因此，产品部件、零件在生产过程中，形成“大肚子”，周转不灵活。到了月底，就调动配备工人，多加床子多实行倒班，全面动员突击。
    由于某些工、卡具的缺乏，也由于有的工人劳动纪律差，不按操作规程生产的事情经常发生。结果是产品质量没有保证，机床事故又不断发生。特别在第三季度，竟发生六十五次事故（内有小部分是因停电），严重地损害了精密的机床设备。
    缺乏基本建设和生产准备工作的经验，是造成上述缺点和错误的主要原因。我们整个工厂的改建工作没有总体计划，车间投入生产的程序也不合理。在机械工业里，一般是工具车间应先投入生产，以便为生产车间准备工、卡具，而我们工厂却是机械装配车间先于工具车间投入生产。但是，我们厂里有着很多富有经验的苏联专家，如果我们不满足于已有的一套经验和在新产品试制中的一些成绩，不自以为用过去的经验和办法可以组织新企业的生产，而老老实实地学习苏联，多听听专家的话，那么，情况会好得多。现在总结这段工作的时候，我们希望正在进行新厂建设的人们，不要再走我们的道路。
