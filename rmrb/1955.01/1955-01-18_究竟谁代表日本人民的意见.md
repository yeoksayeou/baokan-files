Recently, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and U.S. Far East Commander-in-Chief Hull have successively issued blatant threats to Japan, not allowing Japan to make its own decisions regarding its own foreign policy.

On January 12th, Dulles wrote a letter to Japanese Prime Minister Hatoyama, accusing the Hatoyama government of "repeatedly emphasizing that their foreign policy is to promote economic relations with China and the Soviet Union and to normalize Japan's relations with China and the Soviet Union." Dulles threatened that "this raises concerns that the U.S. government's aid program to Japan will be hindered."

Immediately following, on January 13th, Hull ordered Japan in Tokyo: "It (Japan) cannot maintain its freedom while remaining neutral."

One day later, on January 14th, an authoritative figure in the U.S. State Department resolutely announced regarding Japan's foreign policy: "Neutralism cannot be sympathized with."

What logic are these U.S. civil and military officials basing themselves on when they think they have the right to roar at Japan with bloodshot eyes? What policy Japan should implement is entirely Japan's own affair and should naturally be decided by the Japanese people themselves. However, Dulles and Hull clearly do not think so. In their view, it seems that Japan itself has no right to make decisions about its own affairs; only the United States can decide. It is extremely natural for Japan to develop normal relations with its neighbors, because only in this way can Japan extricate itself from its current unnatural state and the increasingly serious difficulties arising therefrom. But in the eyes of Dulles and Hull, the United States has already decided that Japan should be enemies with its neighbors and be at the forefront of the new war the United States is preparing. Japan must act according to the United States' decision, regardless of life and death. Otherwise, the United States will "worry" that its "aid program to Japan will be hindered" and will determine that Japan cannot "maintain its freedom."

Here, people see a clear picture: the United States is holding a gun to Japan's back, forcing it to walk the dangerous path designated by the United States. However, the American gun cannot scare the Japanese people.

After Hull announced that Japan "cannot maintain its freedom while remaining neutral," he used the hackneyed tune of opposing China and the Soviet Union to conceal his intention to threaten the Japanese people. He said: "If Japan still intends to maintain neutrality without strengthening its defense forces (i.e., the forces for Japan to rearm and fight at the forefront for the United States), it will be controlled by the Soviet Union or Communist China."

People know that Hull is lying through his teeth. There are now many countries in Asia that prefer to pursue their own independent and autonomous policies. They do not approve of colonial control and are unwilling to expand their military and prepare for war. They advocate peaceful coexistence and international cooperation. Therefore, they receive the support of the people and are more free and have a louder voice than those countries that follow the United States' war policy. It can be seen that the American method of preparing for war is by no means a method of "maintaining freedom," but a method of suppressing freedom and destroying freedom. It is precisely because of this that the Japanese people and many Japanese patriots demand an independent and autonomous foreign policy. This broad and powerful demand is what has led the current Japanese government to make expressions of improving Japan's relations with China and the Soviet Union. This is an obvious fact.

However, Hull despises this demand of the Japanese people. He accused those Japanese people who do not believe that China and the Soviet Union will invade Japan, those who oppose rearming Japan to fight at the forefront for the United States, and those who advocate that Japan have an independent and autonomous policy, saying that he does not believe that these people represent the opinion of the majority of the Japanese people.

May I ask Hull, is it the Japanese people who can represent the opinion of the Japanese people, or is it the American people who can represent the opinion of the Japanese people? Just because Hull is now posing as the master in Japan, does he dare to imagine that he represents the opinion of the Japanese people?

    究竟谁代表日本人民的意见
    蒋元椿
    最近美国国务卿杜勒斯和美国驻远东军总司令赫尔等先后对日本发出露骨的威胁，不许日本就它自己的对外政策作出自己的主张。
    一月十二日杜勒斯给日本鸠山首相写信，指责鸠山政府“反复强调他们的外交政策是要促进同中苏两国的经济关系并使日本同中苏两国的邦交趋于正常化。”杜勒斯威胁说，“这使人担心美国政府的对日援助计划会遭受阻碍。”
    紧跟着，一月十三日赫尔在东京命令日本：“它（日本）是不能够处于中立地位而又保持其自由的。”
    过了一天，一月十四日，美国国务院权威人士又就日本的对外政策问题断然宣布：“对于中立主义是不能同情的。”
    美国文武官员认为他们有权利闪着血红的眼睛对日本这样发吼，他们所根据的逻辑究竟是什么？日本应该实行什么政策，完全是日本自己的事情，当然应该由日本人民自己决定才是。但是，杜勒斯和赫尔却显然不这样想。在他们看来，好像日本的事情日本自己倒是无权作出主张，只有美国才能决定。日本发展它自己和它的邻邦的正常关系本来是极其自然的事，因为只有这样，日本才能解除目前它所处的不自然的状态及由此而产生的日益严重的困难。但是在杜勒斯和赫尔看来，美国已经决定了要日本同它的邻邦做仇敌，替美国正在准备中的新战争打前锋，日本就必须不顾死活，照美国的决定办事。否则美国就要“担心”它的“对日援助计划遭受阻碍”，就要断定日本不能“保持其自由”。
    人们在这里看到一幅清楚的图画：美国用手枪顶在日本背后，要它走美国所指定的危险道路。但是，美国的手枪却是吓不倒日本人民的。
    赫尔宣布了日本“不能够处于中立地位而又保持其自由”之后，又用反对中国和苏联的滥调来掩饰他威胁日本人民的用心。他说：“如果日本还打算维持中立而不去加强它的防御力量（按即日本重新武装起来替美国打前锋的力量）它就会受到苏联或共产党中国的左右。”
    人们知道赫尔是睁着眼在撒谎。现在亚洲就有不少国家宁愿奉行自己独立自主的政策。它们不赞成殖民主义控制，不愿扩军备战。它们主张和平共处、国际合作。它们因此受到人民的支持，比那种跟着美国的战争政策跑的国家自由得多，声音也响亮得多。可见美国的准备战争的办法决不是什么“保持自由”的办法，而是镇压自由、毁灭自由的办法。正是因为这样，所以日本人民和日本许多爱国人士要求有一个独立自主的对外政策。这种广大有力的要求才使得现在的日本政府作出改善日本同中苏的关系的表示。这是明显的事实。
    但是赫尔却蔑视日本人民的这种要求。他对那些不相信中国和苏联会侵略日本的日本人士，对那些反对重新武装日本来为美国打前锋的以及那些主张日本有一个独立自主的政策的日本人士硬加指责，说他不相信这种人士代表日本人民大多数的意见。
    请问赫尔，究竟是日本人士能代表日本人民的意见呢？还是美国人士能代表日本人民的意见呢？难道因为赫尔现在在日本冒充主子，他就敢于设想他代表日本人民的意见么？
