    Shanghai Holds Exhibition of Folk Woodcut New Year Pictures
    To showcase the achievements of folk woodcut art, the Shanghai Museum, in conjunction with the Spring Festival mass cultural activities, opened an exhibition of folk woodcut New Year pictures on January 24th. The exhibition features a total of 230 New Year pictures, including themes such as New Year auspiciousness, customs and current affairs, stories and operas, landscapes, flowers and fruits, beauties and dolls. Works were solicited from various regions beforehand, covering a wide range of producing areas, including Shanghai, Suzhou, Yangzhou, Weixian, Tianjin, Zhangzhou, as well as Anhui, Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, Guangxi, Guangdong and other places. All the exhibits are divided into eight categories according to their forms and types: "Agricultural Calendar Pictures," "Door Panels," "Hall Paintings," "Kite Paper, Revolving Lanterns," "Continuous Story Paintings," "Ox Prints," "God Statues, Paper Horses," and "Flower Paper, Hanging Decorations." From the works exhibited this time, we can see how excellent folk artists from different regions combine with the lives of the masses in their creations, express the people's hope for a happy life, and give play to the creativity of artistic styles. This exhibition will play a certain reference role in the current improvement and development of New Year picture work. In order to develop its business, expand patriotic propaganda to the masses, and enrich the people's cultural life, the Shanghai Museum will continue to hold various special exhibitions on art in the future.

    上海举办民间木刻年画展览
    上海博物馆为了介绍民间木刻艺术的成就，于一月二十四日起配合春节群众文化活动，举办民间木刻年画展览。展出年画共计二百三十余幅，包括新年吉庆、风俗时事、故事戏文、风景花果、仕女娃娃等内容。事前曾向各地征集作品，出品地区范围较广，有上海、苏州、扬州、潍县、天津、漳州以及安徽、四川、贵州、湖南、广西、广东等地。全部展品按形式种类分成“农历图”、“门屏”、“堂画”、“鹞纸、走马灯”、“连续故事画”、“牛印”、“神像、纸马”、“花纸、挂乐”等八个项目。从这次展出的作品中，可以看到不同地区优秀的民间美术家，在创作中怎样结合着群众生活、表现了人民对美满生活的希望和发挥了艺术风格上的创造性。这次展览对于目前年画工作的改进和发展，将会起一定的参考作用。上海博物馆为了开展业务，扩大对群众进行爱国主义的宣传，丰富人民文化生活，今后将陆续举办各种艺术方面的专题展览。（郑为）
