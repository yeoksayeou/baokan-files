    Shanghai Food Company During the Spring Festival
    By Our Correspondent Yu Bing
    The No. 1 retail department of the state-owned China Food Company's Shanghai branch, located on Nanjing Road in Shanghai, has seen over 100,000 customers daily in the ten-odd days leading up to the Spring Festival, all orderly selecting their favorite foods.
    To meet the needs of the general public for non-staple foods during the Spring Festival, the Shanghai Food Company began sourcing large quantities of goods from various regions as early as the third quarter of last year. Although the floods in many areas last year affected the supply of goods, and the recent heavy snow in various regions has affected transportation, these difficulties have been overcome with the strong support of fraternal commercial and transportation departments, and especially the broad masses of farmers.
    Stepping into the store, you can see more than 1,500 different kinds of food from all over the country, displayed in over twenty giant counters, illuminated by hundreds of colored electric lights, dazzlingly. Here are dried Hami melons from Xinjiang, pickled mustard tubers from Yunnan, apples from our friendly neighbor Korea, and sugar from Poland. There are also plump squid, dried shrimp, jellyfish, clam meat, and various salted fish; as well as various dried vegetables, dried fruits, fresh fruits, preserved meats, pastries, cakes, and canned goods. This food company, through its several powerful wholesale stations, regularly supplies more than 90 percent of the meat, eggs, and fruits consumed by Shanghai's six million residents.
    To expedite sales and make things convenient for customers, the company began simplifying retail procedures more than two months ago: popular foods such as vermicelli, New Year cakes, sweets, and fruits that could be packaged were pre-packaged by weight or amount, or bundled together. Some goods were graded before sale; for some bottled foods, they pre-calculated the prices for one or more bottles and wrote them on a "quick calculation ruler." No matter how many bottles you buy, you can quickly find the price by looking at the "quick calculation ruler" without having to calculate on the spot, thus greatly shortening customers' waiting time with "pay on one side, deliver on the other."
    The three hundred or more salespersons who are busy day and night have launched a labor competition, putting forward the slogan "The busier we are, the better our attitude." Under the education of the Party and the trade union, they have further realized the great significance of state-owned commercial work in strengthening the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and meeting the needs of the people, so their service attitude has improved significantly.
    Last autumn, when major floods occurred in Anhui, Jiangsu, and other places, a large number of poultry from the disaster areas were transported to Shanghai for sale. To cooperate with disaster relief, the Shanghai Food Company successively received more than 40,000 cattle, more than 300,000 pigs, and more than 200,000 chickens, ducks, and geese. At that time, the weather was still hot, and meat sales were sluggish, and feeding them required a large amount of feed. They slaughtered the pigs and pickled them into salted meat, and slaughtered the chickens, ducks, and geese and made them into frozen chicken, frozen duck, and frozen goose, and some were made into canned goods. When they first went on sale, many customers were not used to eating frozen meat and thought the salted meat was not good in color and refused to buy it. The sales staff repeatedly explained the excellent properties of frozen meat and cooking methods to customers, and quickly opened up sales. This not only solved some of the difficulties of the disaster victims, but also increased the variety of non-staple foods for the urban people. Once, a customer surnamed Cui who lived in Lane 201, Shanhai Guan Road, bought a piece of salted meat. After taking it home, his mother disliked the color and asked to return it. The salesperson Wang Yifeng personally went to his home and explained the cooking methods to him, and the result was the same as the meat they usually ate. The old lady gratefully urged her son to write a long letter to thank the salesperson. The letter said:
    "I deeply realize that only under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party can there be such shop assistants who serve the people."
    Because the Shanghai Food Company and relevant departments have fully grasped the source of goods and prices, they have guaranteed the supply of non-staple foods during the Spring Festival.

    春节中的上海食品公司
    本报记者　于冰
    座落在上海南京路的国营中国食品公司上海市公司第一门市部，在春节前的十多天，每天有十万以上的顾客，有秩序地在这里挑选他们喜爱的食品。
    为了满足广大人民春节中对副食品的需要，上海市食品公司，早在去年第三季度，就从各地源源调来了大量的货物。虽然由于去年不少地区遭受水灾，影响了货源，最近各地大雪，又影响了运输，但是在各兄弟商业部门、运输部门，特别是广大农民的大力支持下，这些困难都克服了。
    走进商场，你可以看到来自全国各地的一千五百多种不同花色的食品，陈列在二十多个巨型柜台里，数百盏彩色电灯照耀着它们，光彩夺目。这里有来自新疆的哈蜜瓜干，有来自云南的大头菜，也有来自友邦朝鲜的苹果，和来自波兰的沙糖。还有肥美的鱿鱼、虾米、海蜇、蚬肉和各种咸鱼；以及各种干菜、干果、鲜水果、腌腊、糕点、糕饼和罐头等。这个食品公司通过它的几个强大的批发站，经常供应着上海市六百万人吃的百分之九十以上的肉类、蛋品和水果。
    为了卖得快，为了使顾客方便，早在两个多月以前，这个公司就进行了零售手续的简化工作：像粉丝、年糕、糖食、水果等热销食品，凡是能包扎的都按重量、按金额包成了包、或捆成捆，有些货物，在卖以前就分了档；有些瓶装食品，他们把一瓶至多瓶都事先算好了价钱，写在“速算尺”上，随便你买多少瓶，只要一看“速算尺”很快就可以查出价钱，不需要临时细算，这样“一边付钱，一边交货”大大缩短了顾客们的等候时间。
    日夜忙碌着的三百多名营业员，开展了劳动竞赛，他们提出“工作越忙、态度越好”的口号。在党和工会的教育下，他们进一步认识到国营商业工作，对于加强城乡物资交流，和满足人民需要的重大意义，因此服务态度有了显著改进。
    去年秋天，安徽、江苏等地发生大水灾，灾区大批家禽运来上海出售。上海食品公司为配合救灾，曾先后接收了四万多头牛，三十多万口猪，和二十多万只鸡、鸭、鹅。当时天气还热，肉类销路不旺，喂养起来又需要大量饲料。他们把猪宰杀后腌成咸肉，鸡、鸭、鹅宰杀后制成冻鸡、冻鸭、冻鹅，有的制成罐头。在开始出售时，不少顾客由于不习惯吃冻肉，认为咸肉色泽不好，不肯买，经营业员们反复地向顾客解释冻肉的优良性质，和烹饪方法，很快就打开了销路，这样既解决了灾民们的一部分困难，也给城市人民增加了副食品的品种。有一次，住在山海关路二○一弄的一位姓崔的顾客买到一块咸肉，带回家后他母亲嫌颜色不好看，要求退货，经营业员王一峰亲自跑到他家，向他讲明了烹饪方法，结果和他们平时吃的肉一样。老太太感激地叮嘱儿子写了一封长信来感谢营业员。信上说：
  “我深深体会到只有毛主席和共产党的领导，才会有这样为人民服务的店员”。
    由于上海食品公司和有关部门，充分掌握了货源和价格，保证了春节中副食品的供应。
