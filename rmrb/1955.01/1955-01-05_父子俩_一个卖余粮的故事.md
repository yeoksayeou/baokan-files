Father and Son
    ——A Story of Selling Surplus Grain
    By Our Correspondent Gao Changren
    (I)
    Song Yuchun is a Communist Youth League member from Shihe Township, Xishui County, Hubei Province. During the unified purchase of surplus grain in 1953, in order to "take the lead in fulfilling the task," he sold an extra two hundred catties, despite knowing his family only had six hundred catties of surplus grain and against his father's wishes. In the spring of 1954, his family lacked rations, and every three to five days, they went to the township government to request supplies. This was truly difficult for him: going to the township government too often, he feared the cadres would say he "hadn't firmly established his League member stance"; returning home, he was blamed by his father, mother, and wife. He was caught in the middle, almost losing heart in his work. However, under the education of the League branch, he recognized that a Communist Youth League member must have the spirit to overcome difficulties. Over the past year, he has still actively participated in various tasks in the township.

    When the township arranged the task of unified grain purchase in 1954, Song Yuchun initially had concerns, fearing that he would have to sell next year's rations again in order to take the lead in fulfilling the task, just like in 1953. But he saw that the cadres had reviewed certain shortcomings of the past unified purchase work and studied the four retentions (rations, seeds, feed, and reserve grain) policy of the 1954 unified grain purchase, and knew that some people selling rations and some people not selling all their surplus grain were shortcomings in the work. At the same time, when he realized the importance of selling surplus grain to support national industrial construction, support the liberation of Taiwan, and support disaster areas, all his concerns were dispelled. At the township people's representative conference, he accurately reported his family's yield, and he initially planned to sell one thousand catties of surplus grain.

    Song Yuchun took the lead in reporting the actual yield, which was praised by the Party and League branches. The Party and League branches knew that his father was very dissatisfied with the overzealous selling of surplus grain in 1953, so they asked him to go back and hold a family meeting to promote the policy and get his father and the whole family on board.

    When returning home, Song Yuchun specially requested a "Selling Surplus Grain" ballad from the township government, intending to use it as an introduction to promote the significance of grain purchase to his father and family.

    (II)

    Song Yuchun's family is of middle peasant status. His father, Song Boyue, has always been very diligent and thrifty, and is already fifty-four years old. Because the surplus grain was sold excessively the previous year, Song Boyue was very dissatisfied; when the unified purchase work began last year, Song Yuchun often attended meetings, and Song Boyue was restless at home, fearing that his son might over-report the yield and sell too much surplus grain. He thought:
  "If it's like the past, it will be troublesome again next spring." The more he thought about it, the angrier he became with his son, and he said fiercely to his wife, "I want to separate from Yuchun. If he sells too much grain, let him go hungry. The two of us old folks will keep more grain." Yuchun's mother also agreed. Yuchun's wife, Feng Jichun, often picked green broad bean pods to eat in the fields when there was a shortage of rations in the summer, and suffered a lot of trouble, and was also dissatisfied with her husband.

    One night, when Yuchun returned home from a meeting, his family seemed to be sulking with him, and no one paid attention to him. His wife served him a bowl of buckwheat dumplings and then went to wash the pot and dishes, making a loud clattering noise. Yuchun saw that the situation was not good. After he finished eating, he took out the "Selling Surplus Grain" ballad and sang it alone under the lamp. His wife and father ignored him, only his younger brother came to snatch a copy of the ballad to read. He couldn't understand it and went to ask his father.

    Song Yuchun was hoping to use his father's reading of the ballad as an opportunity to talk to him about the surplus grain selling policy, but his father only glanced at it and didn't say anything. The family of four or five people couldn't seem to talk to each other.

    The next day at breakfast, Song Yuchun couldn't hold back and said bluntly to his father: "Dad! Dad! This year's surplus grain selling policy is very good, there is no rigid task, the policy is four retentions..."

    Before his son could continue, the old man became angry: "Let me tell you straight, you can be glorious if you want, I want to separate from you. I want to keep more grain, if you want to sell more, you go hungry."

    Yuchun said: "Dad! Selling surplus grain is three major supports, taking the new road..."

    The father was even more angry: "You take your new road, I take my old road."

    Yuchun also said angrily at this time: "Why is your thinking so stubborn, you are really pig-headed!"

    The father slammed the table and roared: "You dare to scold your father!" He angrily ran into the room and lay down under the covers.
        (III)
    This quarrel made things tense. The father was so angry that he didn't talk to Yuchun, nor did he eat at the same table with him. Yuchun had no choice but to go to the neighbor and find the Party branch committee member Song Chaoguo to find a solution. Song Chaoguo told Yuchun: "Don't be impatient, your father's thinking needs to be cleared up slowly. First, you need to mobilize your wife, Feng Jichun, and then have your wife mobilize your mother, and let your mother advise your father, mobilizing step by step. You must stand firm, do the work you should do well, and patiently persuade your father after his anger has subsided."

    Yuchun listened to Song Chaoguo's words, and in the evening, he confided in his wife. Feng Jichun said: "I don't have any major opinions about you, I'm just afraid that you'll sell too much surplus grain this time, just like in the past, and it will be difficult again next spring, and you'll make your father angry. You're always attending meetings, leaving a lot of housework for me to do. I have a child to take care of, and I get impatient when I can't finish it." Yuchun said: "Now there is a 'four retentions' policy for selling grain, and the rations are sufficient. It's not a bad thing that I often attend meetings, if I don't attend meetings, I won't understand so much. You are a young person and you should also make progress. The village is holding a youth meeting tomorrow, you should also go and listen to the policy, and we two need to clear up the thinking of our father and mother." Feng Jichun and Yuchun originally had a very good relationship. Yuchun told her the benefits he had received after selling surplus grain last year, and she also agreed to attend the youth meeting tomorrow evening.

    Feng Jichun further understood the policy of selling surplus grain at the youth meeting, and saw that everyone else was guaranteeing to mobilize their whole family to sell surplus grain, and everyone said that the "four retentions" policy was good. She thought carefully that Yuchun had not done anything wrong in the first place, and under the encouragement of the women's cadre Song Yulan, she took the initiative to review at the meeting that it was wrong of her to only complain about Yuchun in the past. She also guaranteed to go back and mobilize her mother-in-law.

    Back home, while cooking and doing needlework, she told her mother-in-law what she understood about the surplus grain selling policy. The mother-in-law said: "I didn't understand the policy in the past, and I just believed the old man's words. If the policy is really this good this year, I will also try to persuade your father."
        (IV)
    Song Boyue had been angry for two days, and many old things stirred in his heart. He thought that since liberation, everything the Communist Party has done has been good. In the past, the usurious loans he borrowed to buy land could not be paid off year after year, but now there are no usurious loans, and life is getting better and better; the Communist Party promotes marital freedom, so he doesn't have to worry about it, and his son married a good wife and had a grandson; in the past, he was extorted and blackmailed by the puppet township and bao chiefs, and could not hold his head up for most of his life, but now there is no such thing anymore. But he always felt that selling too much surplus grain in the past was not a good thing.

    When his wife advised him: "Everyone says the grain purchase policy is very good, don't be angry with Yuchun anymore, ask him what the policy is." At this time, his anger had subsided by half, and he also wanted to ask Yuchun what was going on, but in order to maintain the dignity of the head of the family, he was unwilling to ask Yuchun first.

    One morning, the family was sitting around the table eating again. Yuchun saw that his father's bowl of rice was almost finished, so he quickly helped him add rice. The old man ignored him and went to add it himself. When he ate the second bowl, there was still half of the rice left, and Yuchun went to grab it and add more. The old man then opened his mouth and said, "There's still some left." Yuchun couldn't wait for him to speak, so he took the opportunity to say, "Dad, it was my fault for arguing with you the day before yesterday. You are an old man, and I am your son, and I shouldn't have scolded you. I was criticized by the cadres, and everyone said that you are a sensible person. What you are impatient with now is that the surplus grain was sold too much in the past. This is a shortcoming of the township's work, and the cadres have all reviewed it."

    Song Boyue was a little more comfortable at this time, and said slowly: "Your father's thinking is very clear, I'm just afraid that it will be sold too much again, and I'll have to run for 'supplies' next year, which is like selling firewood and buying firewood to burn, selling wood to buy thatch, adding an extra layer of trouble."

    Yuchun said: "Now we guarantee not to sell too much, the policy has 'four retentions'."

    The father had already calmed down, and he asked his son: "What is 'four retentions', and how do you retain it?"

    Yuchun said: "Four retentions means first leaving the rations. In our township, for adults and children, it's three dan and six dou a year. Households with more single men and strong men can leave more, do you think that's enough?"

    "Enough," the father nodded.

    Yuchun then asked his father: "My family has two older sisters and two nephews. What should we do if they come to our house to visit relatives and eat grain?"

    The father smacked his lips with difficulty and said: "That's really difficult!"

    Yuchun said: "It's not difficult, the policy stipulates that there is reserve grain."

    The father said happily: "That's good." Yuchun also told him that the two sisters' families also kept reserve grain, and eating grain would not be a problem for relatives coming and going.

    The son also said: "The government has also thought about raising pigs and chickens, and the policy stipulates that there is feed grain, like our family can keep forty catties of feed."

    The father smiled. After thinking for a while, he asked his son: "Is seed included?"

    The son said: " Keep as much as you need, keep whatever seeds you need."

    Yuchun added: The township cadres have already reviewed the shortcomings of the past, and now they guarantee to handle things according to the policy, seek truth from facts, and sell as much surplus grain as we should. Then he talked about the reasons why selling surplus grain supports industrial construction, supports the liberation of Taiwan, and supports disaster areas, and also talked about the changes in his family's production and life since the unified purchase: in the spring of 1954, they bought a lot of fertilizer with the surplus money from selling grain, and the yield increased in the fields in the fall; the father and son had never worn rubber shoes before, but now they wear them; the whole family has added fine cloth clothes, and Feng Jichun also made a silk shirt in the summer; the old house at home has been rebuilt. In the past, his family borrowed money to buy land and was exploited by usurious loans, but now they can borrow money from the credit cooperative. Talking about these things, Song Boyue listened more and more attentively. Yuchun struck while the iron was hot and discussed with his father how to accurately report the yield.

    When reporting the yield, there were still some disputes between father and son. The father unconsciously concealed a little from each piece of land, but his son exposed them all. In the end, the old man said: "If we report it like this, won't we be unable to hide even a dou?"

    Yuchun said with a smile: "The four retentions are fully retained, what else do we need to hide? The government takes care of us so well, and there are three major supports, it would be unfair to the country to hide the yield again."

    Song Boyue said a little embarrassedly at this time: "I was confused. Then let's calculate how much the four retentions are, and how much surplus grain do we still need to sell besides the public grain?"

    After the father and son calculated, they decided to sell one thousand and fifty-seven catties of surplus grain.

    父子俩
    ——一个卖余粮的故事
    本报记者　高长任
    （一）
    宋玉春是湖北省浠水县石河乡一个青年团员。在一九五三年统购余粮的时候，他为了“带头完成任务”，虽然知道家里只有六百斤余粮，也不顾父亲的反对多卖了二百斤。一九五四年春天他家就缺了口粮，每隔三、五天，就到乡政府要求供应。那时着实使他为难：到乡政府的次数多了，怕干部们说他“没有站稳团员立场”；回到家里，又受父亲、母亲和妻子的埋怨。他两面受气，对工作几乎灰心。但他在团支部的教育下，认识到一个青年团员必须有克服困难的精神。这一年来，他还是积极在乡里参加各种工作。
    一九五四年乡里布置粮食统购任务的时候，宋玉春开始还有顾虑，他怕还和一九五三年一样，为了带头完成任务，又要卖出明年的口粮。但他看到干部检讨了过去统购工作的某些缺点，和学习了一九五四年统购粮食的四留（口粮、种子、饲料、机动粮）政策，知道过去有些人卖出了口粮，部分人余粮没卖清，是工作中的缺点。同时，当他认识到卖余粮对支援国家工业建设、支援解放台湾、支援灾区的重要意义，他一切顾虑都打消了。他在乡人民代表大会会议上，报清了自己家里的产量，他初步计划，可以卖出一千斤余粮。
    宋玉春带头报实了产量，受到党、团支部的表扬。党、团支部知道他父亲很不满意一九五三年卖余粮有点过火，就要他回去开好家庭会，宣传政策，打通他父亲和全家人的思想。
    回家时，宋玉春特地向乡政府要了一份“卖余粮”唱词，他准备用它做引子，向父亲和家里宣传购粮意义。
    （二）
    宋玉春的家庭是中农成份。他父亲宋伯约一向很勤俭，已到了五十四岁的年纪了。由于前年余粮卖的过了火，宋伯约很不满意；在去年统购工作刚开始时，宋玉春经常开会，宋伯约在家里就心神不定，怕儿子可能又多报产量，多卖余粮，他想：
  “要是和过去一样，来年春天就又要麻烦死人了。”他越想越对儿子生气，就对老伴发狠说：“我要和玉春分家，他多卖粮叫他去挨饿，我老两口子要多留点粮食。”玉春的母亲也表示同意。玉春的爱人冯济春在夏季缺口粮的时候，她常到田里采摘青?豆荚吃，受过不少麻烦，也对丈夫不满。
    有一天晚上，玉春开完会回家，家里人像和他赌气似的，一个人也不理他。爱人盛一碗荞麦疙瘩送到他面前，就去洗锅刷碗，把锅、碗弄的哗啦哗啦响。玉春看这苗头有些不对。他吃过饭，就掏出“卖余粮”的唱词一个人在灯下唱。他老婆和他父亲都没有理他，只有小兄弟来抢着要了一张唱词来看，他看不懂，又去问父亲。
    宋玉春正指望借父亲看唱词的机会，和他谈谈卖余粮的政策，谁知他父亲只望了一眼，也不吭声。一家四五口人总说不起话来。
    第二天在桌上吃早饭的时候，宋玉春忍不住了，他开门见山地对父亲说：“爷（即父亲）！爷！今年卖余粮政策好的很，不死扣任务，政策是四留……”
    不等儿子说下去，老头子就火了：“我跟你说句直话，你爱光荣你去爱，我要和你分家。我要多留粮食，你要多卖，你们去挨饿。”
    玉春说：“爷！卖余粮是三大支援，走新道路。……”
    父亲更气了：“你走你的新道路，我走我的旧道路。”
    玉春这时也生气地说：“你思想怎么这样顽固，真是死脑筋！”
    父亲把桌子一拍，吼道：“你敢骂你老子。”就气得跑到房里盖着被子躺下了。
        （三）
    这一吵，把事情弄僵了，父亲气得不和玉春说话，也不和他在一桌吃饭。玉春没办法，就到邻舍找党支委宋朝国想办法。宋朝国告诉玉春：“你不要性急，你父亲的思想要慢慢打通。先要把你爱人冯济春发动起来，由你爱人再发动你母亲，让你母亲再劝你父亲，一步步发动。你要站稳立场，该做的活好好做，等你父亲气消了再耐心地劝他。”
    玉春听了宋朝国的话，晚上，他就和爱人谈心。冯济春说：“对你大的意见也没有，就怕你这回还和过去一样多卖余粮，到来年春天又要作难，还要惹父亲生气。你老是开会，许多生活留给我做，我有个小孩缠着，做不过来就不耐烦。”玉春说：“现在卖粮有‘四留’政策，口粮都是留得足了的。我常开会也不是坏事，要不开会就懂不到这么多道理。你是年青人也要进步，明天村里开青年会，你也去听听政策，父亲、母亲的思想还要我们两个人打通呢。”冯济春和玉春本来感情很好，玉春把去年卖余粮以后得到的好处告诉她，她也答应明天晚上参加青年会。
    冯济春在青年会上更进一步知道卖余粮的政策，看到别人都保证要发动全家卖余粮，人人都说
  “四留”政策好。她细想玉春本来没有什么错处，在妇女干部宋玉兰的鼓励下，她在会上主动检讨自己过去光埋怨玉春是不对的。她也保证要回去发动婆婆。
    回到家里，在做饭、做针线的时候，就把她懂得的卖余粮的政策告诉婆婆。婆婆说：“我往日也不懂政策，就信老头子的话，今年政策真的这样好，我也去劝劝你父亲。”
        （四）
    宋伯约生了两天气，心里也翻腾起不少旧事。他想，自从解放以后，共产党办的事样样都好，过去为了买田向别人借的高利贷，年年还不清，现在没有高利贷，日子一天宽裕一天；共产党兴婚姻自主，不用自己操心，儿子就娶了个好媳妇，又生了孙子；过去受伪乡、保长的敲诈、勒索，大半辈子抬不起头来，现在再没有那种事了。可就是过去余粮卖过了火，他总觉得办的不好。
    当老伴劝他：“人家都说购粮政策好的很，你不要再和玉春呕气了，你问问他到底是什么政策。”他这时气也消了一半，也有心想找玉春问个究竟，可是为了保持家长的尊严，总不肯先问玉春。
    一天早晨，一家人又围在桌上吃饭，玉春看着父亲碗里的饭快吃完了，就赶快帮他添饭，老头子没理他，自己跑去添了。吃第二碗，饭还有一半，玉春又去抢着添。老头子这才开腔说：“还有”。玉春巴不得他能说话，就乘机说：“爷，前天和你吵嘴是我的不是，你是老人，我是你儿子，不该骂你，我受到干部的批评，大家都说你是明白人，你现在不耐烦的，就是过去余粮卖的过了火，这是乡里工作的缺点，干部们都检讨了。”
    宋伯约这才舒服一点，慢吞吞的说：“你老子思想明白的很，就是怕又卖过火，来年又要跑‘供应’，那不是砍柴卖、买柴烧，卖了木柴买茅草，多一层麻烦。”
    玉春说：“现在保证不卖过火，政策上有‘四留’。”
    父亲已经心平气静了，他问儿子：“什么叫‘四留’，怎么留法？”
    玉春说：“四留是先留下口粮，我们这个乡大口小口，一年三石六斗，单身汉、壮年人多的户还可多留，你看够不够。”
    “够”，父亲点点头。
    玉春这时反问父亲：“我家两个姐姐，两个外甥，他们要是我家来走亲戚，吃粮怎么办呢？”
    父亲为难地咂咂嘴说：“真难办！”
    玉春说：“不难办，政策上规定有机动粮。”
    父亲愉快地说：“那好了”。玉春又告诉他，两个姐姐家也留机动粮，亲戚来往走动，吃粮都不成问题。
    儿子又说：“养猪、养鸡，这一条政府也想到了，政策上规定有饲料粮，像我家就能留四十斤饲料。”
    父亲笑眯眯的了。想了一下又问儿子：“种子在不在内？”
    儿子说：“需要多少，留多少，要什么种子就留什么。”
    玉春又说：过去的缺点乡干部已经做了检讨，现在保证按政策办事，实事求是，该卖多少余粮就卖多少。接着他讲了卖余粮是支援工业建设、支援解放台湾、支援灾区的道理，也讲了他家统购以来生产和生活的变化：一九五四年春天用卖粮余资买了许多肥料，秋天田里就增了产；父子俩从来没穿过胶鞋，现在也穿上了；一家人都添了细布衣裳，冯济春在夏天还做了府绸褂子；家里旧房子翻盖了。过去他家借债买田受高利贷剥削，现在借钱用可找信用合作社。谈到这些，宋伯约就越听越入耳。玉春趁热打铁，就和父亲商量如何报清产量。
    报产量的时候，父子之间还有些争执。父亲不自觉地把每块田都瞒了一点，但都被儿子揭了底，最后一算，老头子说：“照这样报，不是一斗也瞒不起来吗？”
    玉春笑着说：“四留留得足足的，还要瞒什么？政府照顾的这么周到，还有三大支援，再瞒产量就对不起国家。”
    宋伯约这时也不好意思地说：“是我糊涂了。那就再算算四留多少，除了公粮，还要卖多少余粮？”
    父子俩一算，决定卖出一千零五十七斤余粮。
