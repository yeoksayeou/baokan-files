Xinhua News Agency, January 7th: Washington dispatch: U.S. President Eisenhower on the 6th requested the Senate to consider and approve the U.S.-Chiang "Joint Defense Treaty" "at an early date." Eisenhower's message to the Senate, under the guise of "defense," blatantly revealed the aggressive conspiracy of the United States to intensify its hostility towards the Chinese people and prepare for expanding the war by using the U.S.-Chiang treaty.

    Eisenhower said in his message that the purpose of the U.S.-Chiang treaty was to "prevent" the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, and that this treaty was also "another link in the chain" of the U.S. aggressive bloc in the Western Pacific. The message also included the notes exchanged between U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and the "Foreign Minister" of the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique, Yeh Kung-ch'ao, on December 10th last year. According to the "understanding" in the notes, the United States recognized that the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique possessed the so-called "inherent right of self-defense" not only over Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, but also over "all territories under its control in the future," and could use "force." Eisenhower also clamored in his message for taking "counter-action" against the Chinese people's actions to liberate Taiwan. Eisenhower's message and the attached notes confirmed the argument that the U.S.-Chiang treaty contained the malicious intention of supporting and instigating the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique to restore its rule and expand its aggression against Chinese territory.
    Xinhua News Agency, January 7th: After the signing of the U.S.-Chiang treaty, the United States is scheming to piece together the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique, South Korea, and Japan into a Northeast Asian aggressive bloc to strengthen the U.S. aggressive system in the East.

    According to reports, under the participation of Assistant Secretary of State Robertson, who is responsible for Far Eastern affairs in the United States, Chiang's "Foreign Minister" Yeh Kung-ch'ao and South Korean "Foreign Minister" Byun Young-tae recently held talks in Washington to discuss the methods and steps for establishing a Northeast Asian alliance "as early as possible."

    The activities of Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford in the Far East, which have just ended, are closely related to planning and organizing the Northeast Asian group. According to the International News Service, Radford discussed the possibility of piecing together the Northeast Asian group. The International News Service said that although there are disputes between the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique, South Korea, and Japan, U.S. officials believe that they, who have not joined the Manila Treaty Organization, should form a "defense alliance against Communist China."
    Xinhua News Agency, January 7th: TASS Washington, January 6th: The White House released a letter from Eisenhower to Secretary of Defense Wilson, which put forward the principles of the U.S. policy on armed forces.

    Eisenhower outlined in his letter the U.S. plan to expand war preparations. The letter said that this plan intends to establish "a strong and constantly expanding economy that can be switched to war tasks at any time." Eisenhower said that the United States must focus on "military units that can maximize the application of science and technology," and he agreed to maintain the active manpower of the armed forces at approximately 3 million and increase the manpower of the air force to approximately 975,000 before June 30, 1955.

    艾森豪威尔要求参议院批准美蒋战争条约
   【新华社七日讯】华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔六日要求参议院“及早”考虑批准美蒋“共同防御条约”。艾森豪威尔致参议院的咨文，在“防御”的幌子下，露骨地表示美国利用美蒋条约加紧同中国人民敌对和准备扩大战争的侵略阴谋。
    艾森豪威尔在他的咨文中说，美蒋条约的目的，在于“阻止”中国人民解放台湾和澎湖，并且，这个条约也是美国在西太平洋侵略集团“锁链中的又一个环节”。咨文还附了美国国务卿杜勒斯和蒋介石卖国集团“外交部长”叶公超去年十二月十日交换的照会，根据照会的“谅解”，美国承认蒋介石卖国集团不但对台湾和澎湖，并且对“今后在它控制下的全部领土”拥有所谓“天赋的自卫权利”，可以使用“武力”。艾森豪威尔在他的咨文中还叫嚣要对中国人民解放台湾的行动采取“反行动”。艾森豪威尔的咨文和所附的照会证实了这样一种论断：美蒋条约包含支持和指使蒋介石卖国集团复辟和扩大对中国领土的侵略的恶毒用心。
   【新华社七日讯】在美蒋条约签订以后，美国又阴谋把蒋介石卖国集团、南朝鲜和日本拼凑成东北亚侵略集团，加强美国在东方的侵略体系。
    据消息报道，在美国负责远东事务的助理国务卿罗伯逊参加下，蒋贼“外交部长”叶公超和南朝鲜“外务部长官”卞荣泰最近在华盛顿举行了会谈，讨论“及早”成立东北亚联盟的方法和步骤。
    美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福刚刚结束的在远东的活动，就和策划组织东北亚集团有密切关系。据国际新闻社透露，雷德福讨论了拼凑东北亚集团的可能性。国际新闻社说，虽然蒋介石卖国集团、南朝鲜和日本之间存在着纷争，但是，美国官员认为，没有参加马尼拉条约组织的它们，应该结成在一个“反对共产党中国的防御联盟中”。
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社华盛顿六日讯：白宫发表了艾森豪威尔致国防部长威尔逊的一封信，这封信提出了美国的关于武装部队的政策的原则。
    艾森豪威尔在他的信中概括地叙述了美国扩大战争准备的计划。这封信说这个计划打算建立“一个可以随时转入战争任务的强大的、不断扩大的经济”。艾森豪威尔说，美国必须把重点放在“可以最大限度地应用科学和技术的军事单位上”，他同意在一九五五年六月三十日以前把武装部队的现役人力保持约三百万人，并把空军的人力增加到约九十七万五千人。
