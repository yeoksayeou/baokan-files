    Worker-Peasant Friendship
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Shui Tiansheng
    In front of the assembly workshop of the Shanxi Machine Factory, a propaganda board is hung with several golden, full-grained corn cobs. On the table next to it are displayed mushrooms, walnut kernels, peach kernels, and many other local products. These are gifts from the members of the Qincun Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jincheng to the workers of this factory.
    Since the worker-peasant get-together during the Spring Festival last year, workers from the Shanxi Machine Factory, Jin Sheng Textile Factory, Linfen Machinery Repair Factory, and other factories have established regular contact with farmers, exchanging letters and visits, introducing production situations, and exchanging gifts. Over the past year, more than 1,000 farmers have visited the Linfen Machinery Repair Factory. The Xiyangcheng Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fenyang County wrote to the workers of the Shanxi Machine Factory:
    "We used the waterwheels produced by our worker elder brothers to irrigate the land, which not only saved labor but also increased the yield per mu from 500 jin to 800 jin. This is due to the benefits of being organized and inseparable from the help of our worker elder brothers." The letter also stated that all cooperative members overfulfilled the task of selling surplus grain to support industrial construction.
    When the workers learned that their production brought benefits to the farmers, they resolved to manufacture more and better products. The workers of the Linfen Machinery Repair Factory had visited farmers in more than a dozen counties to solicit their opinions on agricultural tools. Last year, the factory manufactured a large number of seeders, windmills, cultivators, and other agricultural tools, all of which were well-suited to the needs of local farmers. Before the autumn sowing last year, the factory specially sent workers to Jinnan to teach the technicians of forty-five agricultural production cooperatives the technology of mastering the seeders and helped farmers cultivate 640 mu of wheat. When worker Li Ruide left Beiduan Township in Hongzhao County, the cooperative members draped him with red silk and flowers and saw him off. He excitedly said, "The peasants love the workers so much; in the future, we must produce more and better agricultural tools to support agricultural production."

    工农友谊
    新华社记者　水天生
    在山西机器厂装配车间前面，一块鼓动板上挂着几个金黄色的颗粒饱满的大玉米穗，旁边的桌子上陈列着蘑菇、核仁、桃仁等许多土产品。这是晋城秦村农业生产合作社社员送给这个厂工人的礼物。
    自从去年春节工农联欢以后，山西机器厂、晋生纺织厂、临汾机械修造厂等工厂的工人，和农民建立了经常的联系，互相通信和参观，介绍生产中的情况，并且互相赠送礼物。一年来，到临汾机械修造厂参观访问的农民有一千多人。汾阳县西阳城村农业生产合作社给山西机器厂的工人来信说：
  “我们使用了工人老大哥生产的水车浇地，不但省了工，而且每亩产量由五百斤提高到了八百斤。这一方面是组织起来的好处，另一方面也和工人老大哥的帮助是分不开的。”信中还说：全体社员为了支援工业建设，超额完成了卖余粮的任务。
    当工人们知道他们的生产给农民带来利益时，他们决心要制造出更多更好的产品来。临汾机械修造厂的工人曾经先后访问了十几个县的农民，征求他们对农具的意见。去年这个厂已制造了大批播种机、风车、中耕器等农具，这些农具都很适合当地农民使用。在去年秋季播种前，这个厂专门派出了工人到晋南教会四十五个农业生产合作社的技术员掌握播种机的技术，并且帮助农民耕种了六百四十亩小麦。工人李瑞德在洪赵县北段乡临走时，社员们给他披红插花，并为他送行。他兴奋地说：“农民这样热爱工人，今后一定要生产更多更好的农具支援农业生产。”
