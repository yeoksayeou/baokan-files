Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai
Statement on the US Government's Interference in the Chinese People's Liberation of Taiwan

The Government of the People's Republic of China has solemnly declared to the world time and again: The Chinese people must liberate their own territory of Taiwan. After the Chinese people recently victoriously liberated Yijiangshan Island, the US government, on the one hand, stepped up military action, engaged in war provocations, and on the other hand, plotted to use the United Nations to carry out the so-called ceasefire trick to interfere in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan.

Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory. Liberating Taiwan is China's sovereignty and internal affair, and no interference from others is allowed. Article 2, Paragraph 7 of the United Nations Charter also clearly stipulates that "Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state or shall require the Members to submit such matters to settlement under the present Charter". Therefore, the United Nations or any foreign country has no right to interfere in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan.  The Government of the Peoples Republic of China absolutely cannot agree to the so-called ceasefire with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique who have been spurned by the Chinese people.

It should be pointed out that the Chinese people's actions in exercising their sovereignty and liberating the Chinese mainland and many coastal islands have never caused tension in the Far East situation. It is only because the US government has occupied Taiwan, protected the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and continuously carried out subversive activities and war threats against the People's Republic of China, that the current tense situation in the Taiwan region has been created. The so-called "mutual defense treaty" signed by the US government and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has further exacerbated this tense situation and seriously threatened peace in the Far East. Obviously, this tense situation comes from the United States, not from China. As long as the US government stops its acts of interfering in China's internal affairs, as long as all US armed forces withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait, this tense situation will naturally disappear.

The so-called ceasefire between the People's Republic of China and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, instigated by the US government and its followers, is actually interfering in China's internal affairs and dividing China's territory. They attempt to use war threats and atomic weapons to intimidate the Chinese people into tolerating the US occupation of Taiwan, recognizing the US-Chiang "mutual defense treaty," and allowing the US to use Taiwan as a military base to prepare for new wars. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. This is resolutely opposed by the Chinese people.

In order to safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, to safeguard China's security and peace in the Far East, the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, the United States must stop interfering in China's internal affairs, and all US armed forces must withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait.

### 周恩来总理兼外长  关于美国政府干涉中国人民解放台湾的声明

    周恩来总理兼外长
    关于美国政府干涉中国人民解放台湾的声明
    中华人民共和国政府曾经一再向世界庄严宣告：中国人民一定要解放自己的领土台湾。美国政府在中国人民最近胜利地解放了一江山岛之后，就一面加紧军事行动，进行战争挑衅，另一面策动通过联合国进行所谓停火的诡计，来干涉中国人民解放台湾。
    台湾是中国领土的不可分割的一部分。解放台湾是中国的主权和内政，决不容他人干涉。联合国宪章第二条第七款也明确规定“本宪章不得认为授权联合国干涉在本质上属于任何国家国内管辖之事件，且并不要求会员国将该项事件依本宪章提请解决”。因此，联合国或任何外国都无权干涉中国人民解放台湾。中华人民共和国政府绝对不能同意同中国人民所唾弃了的蒋介石卖国集团实行所谓停火。
    应该指出，中国人民行使自己的主权，解放中国大陆和许多沿海岛屿的行动，从来没有引起远东局势的紧张。仅仅由于美国政府侵占台湾，庇护蒋介石卖国集团，并不断对中华人民共和国进行颠覆活动和战争威胁，才造成目前台湾地区的紧张局势。美国政府和蒋介石卖国集团签订的所谓“共同防御条约”，更加剧了这种紧张局势，并严重地威胁着远东的和平。很显然，这种紧张局势是来自美国，并非来自中国。只要美国干涉中国内政的行为停止，只要美国的一切武装力量从台湾和台湾海峡撤走，这种紧张局势就自然消除了。
    美国政府和它的追随者策动的中华人民共和国和蒋介石卖国集团之间的所谓停火，实际上就是干涉中国内政，割裂中国领土。它们企图用战争威胁和原子武器的恐吓，强使中国人民容忍美国侵占台湾，承认美蒋“共同防御条约”，容许美国利用台湾作为军事基地，准备新的战争。这是中国人民绝对不能容忍的。这是中国人民坚决反对的。
    为了保障中国的主权和领土完整，为了保障中国的安全和远东的和平，中国人民必须解放台湾，美国必须停止对中国内政的干涉，美国的一切武装力量必须从台湾和台湾海峡撤走。
    一九五五年一月二十四日
