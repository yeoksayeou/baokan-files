Winter School Enrollment Increases Universally Across Regions

    Due to the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, rural cadres and peasant masses urgently need to learn to meet the needs of their work and production. Therefore, the number of people participating in winter schools in 1954 generally increased compared to previous years. In Jiangsu Province, more than 1.4 million farmers participated in winter school, an increase of 430,000 people compared to 1953. In Gansu Province, more than 360,000 farmers have participated in winter school, an increase of more than three times compared to previous years. Henan Province estimates that 2.5 million farmers will enter winter school, exceeding the total number of winter school enrollments in 1953 by nearly one time. The number of people entering winter school in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has also increased by nearly 50% compared to 1953. During the preparation of winter schools, most counties first trained amateur teachers. In the 1954 winter schools, many senior primary school and junior high school graduates who participated in agricultural production served as amateur teachers. The ranks of teachers have improved both in quantity and quality compared to the past. According to statistics from 41 counties and cities in Liaoning Province, more than 60% of the more than 17,000 trained teachers were senior primary school graduates. Among the 396 winter school teachers in Longnan County, Jiangxi Province, 228 were senior primary school graduates and 147 were junior high school graduates, totaling 375, accounting for 94.7% of the total; in Nankang, Pingxiang, Yudu, Fengxin and other counties, senior primary school and junior high school graduates also accounted for 80% of the winter school teachers. According to statistics from 12 counties and cities in Jilin Province, among the 6,297 winter school teachers, 106 were Party members and 1,506 were Communist Youth League members, accounting for 25% of the total; in Jian County, Party members and Communist Youth League members accounted for 47% of the 452 teachers.
    In winter schools, all regions vigorously organized grassroots cadres, Party members, Communist Youth League members, members of agricultural producers' cooperatives, and other activists to participate in learning. Among the 14,865 winter school students in Zhaozhou County, Heilongjiang Province, there were 634 village cadres, 324 directors of agricultural producers' cooperatives, 3,426 cooperative members, 975 Party members, and 2,909 Communist Youth League members. Among the more than 10,000 people participating in winter school cultural studies in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, there were 2,300 Party members, 2,700 Communist Youth League members, and 6,400 cadres and militiamen. More than 70% of all students were members of agricultural producers' cooperatives, and the rest were members of mutual aid groups. Many regions have opened short-term, full-time study classes for key rural cadres to eliminate illiteracy among grassroots cadres.
    The number of winter schools run by agricultural producers' cooperatives in various regions has increased significantly. In Jiangsu Province, more than 9,800 winter schools were run by agricultural producers' cooperatives, absorbing more than 270,000 students. Among the 2,411 agricultural producers' cooperatives in Henan Province, 665 cooperatives have established people's schools, with more than 26,000 cooperative members enrolled. There are many advantages to running winter schools by agricultural producers' cooperatives. Winter schools run by agricultural producers' cooperatives generally start earlier and are run better than other winter schools, and agricultural producers' cooperatives can uniformly arrange production and study time, greatly facilitating farmers' learning.
    The vast majority of winter schools in various regions have implemented the policy of serving production and central work, using the winter school position to carry out political education among farmers, which has powerfully promoted the development of central work; at the same time, they have also organized farmers to learn culture. Huanggang Township People's School in the suburbs of Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, focused on political education, centered on central work, and adopted methods such as making reports, discussing the unified purchase and sale policy published in newspapers, assigning topics for writing, and specific accounting to educate farmers on the unified purchase and sale policy. Twenty-two of the 28 students in the class consciously sold 8,189 catties of surplus grain, creating a wave of grain sales among the masses. In Dapu Township, Yixing County, Jiangsu Province, winter school students were organized to read newspapers according to the progress of central work, and reading outlines were written on door panels, combined with teaching literacy. Students learned both politics and culture. Some regions have appropriately arranged work and study time, so that cultural lessons can still be taken while carrying out central work. For example, Shangwu Township, Yixing County, Jiangsu Province, after specifically studying and arranging work and study time, winter schools could still maintain 20 concentrated cultural lessons during the 40-day intense work of grain requisition and unified purchase and sale, in addition to self-study and group study time.

    各地冬学入学人数普遍增加
    由于互助合作运动的开展，乡村干部和农民群众迫切要求学习，以适应工作上和生产上的需要，因此，一九五四年参加冬学的人数较往年普遍增多。江苏省有一百四十多万农民参加冬学，比一九五三年增加四十三万人，甘肃省已有三十六万多农民参加冬学，比往年增加了三倍多，河南省估计有二百五十万农民入冬学，超过一九五三年冬学入学总人数将近一倍。内蒙古自治区入冬学人数也比一九五三年增加近百分之五十。各县在筹办冬学期间，一般的都先训练了业余教师。一九五四年冬学有许多参加农业生产的高小和初中毕业生担任了业余教师，教师的阵容无论在数量上和质量上都比过去提高了。据辽宁省四十一个县市的统计，受过训练的一万七千多名教师中，高小毕业生就占百分之六十以上。江西省龙南县三百九十六名冬学教师中，高小毕业生有二百二十八人，初中毕业生有一百四十七人，共三百七十五人，占总数的百分之九十四点七；南康、萍乡、雩都、奉新等县的冬学教师中，高小和初中毕业生也都占百分之八十。吉林省十二个县市的统计，在六千二百九十七名冬学教师中，有党员一百零六名，团员一千五百零六名，占总数的百分之二十五；辑安县四百五十二名教师中，党员和团员占百分之四十七。
    在冬学中，各地都大力组织了基层干部、党员、团员、农业生产合作社社员和其他积极分子参加学习。黑龙江省肇州县一万四千八百六十五名冬学学员中，就有村干部六百三十四人、农业生产合作社主任三百二十四名、社员三千四百二十六人、党员九百七十五人、团员二千九百零九人。山西省平顺县参加冬学文化学习的一万多人中，有党员二千三百人、团员二千七百人、干部民兵六千四百人，全部学员百分之七十以上是农业生产合作社社员，其余是互助组组员。许多地区开办了乡村主要干部的短期脱产学习班，以扫除基层干部中的文盲。
    各地农业生产合作社所办的冬学显著增加。江苏省有九千八百多个冬学是农业生产合作社办的，吸收了二十七万多人入学。河南省二千四百十一个农业生产合作社中有六百六十五个社建立了民校，入学社员二万六千多人。农业生产合作社办冬学有许多优点。凡是由农业生产合作社办的冬学，一般比其他冬学开得早，办得好，而且可以由农业生产合作社统一安排生产和学习时间，大大便利了农民的学习。
    绝大多数地区的冬学贯彻了为生产、为中心工作服务的方针，利用冬学阵地向农民进行政治教育，有力地推动了中心工作的开展；同时也组织农民学习了文化。河南省郑州市郊区黄岗乡民校以政治教育为主，围绕中心工作，采取作报告、讨论报纸所登的统购统销政策、出题作文、具体算账等办法，向农民进行统购统销政策的教育，全班学员二十八人中有二十二人自觉地卖出余粮八千一百八十九斤，带起群众造成了售粮的热潮。江苏省宜兴县大浦乡等地根据中心工作进展情况，组织冬学学员读报，并把读报提纲写在门板上，结合教识字，学员既学了政治，也学了文化。有的地区适当地安排了工作和学习时间，在进行中心工作时，仍可上文化课。如江苏宜兴县尚武乡具体研究和安排了工作和学习时间后，在四十天的征粮、统购统销的紧张工作中，冬学仍可保持集中上文化课二十次，此外还有自学和小组学习时间。
