    财政部发出有关今年经济建设公债的通知
    【新华社七日讯】中华人民共和国财政部于七日发出关于委托中国人民银行发行一九五五年国家经济建设公债几项有关问题的通知。通知说：
    一九五五年国家经济建设公债（以下简称本公债）的发行，仍按财政部一九五三年发出的委托中国人民银行发行一九五四年国家经济建设公债的规定办理，现作几点修正补充如下：
    一、本公债以一九五五年一月一日到十月三十一日为发行时间，并自十月一日起计息。提前缴款者，依本公债条例第三条的规定给以贴息。贴息办法是：凡在一九五五年一月份缴款者，贴给全年利息的十二分之八；二月份缴款者，贴给全年利息的十二分之七；三月份缴款者，贴给全年利息的十二分之六；以下类推；九月份缴款者不再贴息。在本公债起息后缴款者，其应补缴利息，准免予补缴。十一月起停收公债款。
    二、各地人民银行及其所属机构办理本公债的发行和收款，如在开始时公债券尚未领到，得先开临时收据，交缴款人收执，随后再换公债券。
    三、上项公债利息及公债贴息所得，免征利息所得税。银行所开的临时收据免征印花税。
