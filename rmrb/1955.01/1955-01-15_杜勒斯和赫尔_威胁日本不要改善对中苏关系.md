Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 14th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles recently wrote a "personal letter" to Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama, blatantly threatening Japan not to improve its relations with China and the Soviet Union. The main content of this letter has been reported by Kyodo News Agency's Washington correspondent Iwadate on the 12th, based on information obtained by the Japanese Embassy in the United States from the U.S. State Department.

Dulles said in the letter that some remarks made by Ichiro Hatoyama and Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu regarding promoting Japan's economic relations with China and the Soviet Union, and normalizing Japan's relations with China and the Soviet Union, have given the U.S. Congress the impression that "Japan is trying to get close to communist countries." Dulles said, "This raises concerns that the U.S. government's aid plan for Japan will be hindered." Dulles also expressed the hope to meet with Ichiro Hatoyama in the near future.

It is worth noting that Far East U.S. Military Commander Hull made a statement with the same tone as Dulles at a banquet at the Foreign Correspondents' Club in Tokyo on the 13th. He used the bankrupt so-called "communist threat" to intimidate Japan, saying that it "cannot remain neutral and must rearm." Tokyo political observers believe that Hull's remarks are a "reprimand" to the Hatoyama government's remarks about improving Japan's relations with China and the Soviet Union.

### 杜勒斯和赫尔  威胁日本不要改善对中苏关系

    杜勒斯和赫尔
    威胁日本不要改善对中苏关系
    【新华社十四日讯】东京消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯最近在给日本首相鸠山一郎写的一封“个人信件”中，露骨地威胁日本不得改善它对中国和苏联的关系。这封信的主要内容已经由共同社驻华盛顿特派记者岩馆十二日根据日本驻美大使馆从美国国务院方面得来的消息报道出来了。
    杜勒斯在信里说：鸠山一郎和日本外务相重光葵发表的一些关于要促进日本同中国、苏联的经济关系以及使日本和中、苏两国关系正常化的言论，给美国国会造成了“日本正想接近共产党国家”的印象。杜勒斯说：“这就使人担心美国政府的对日援助计划会遭受阻碍。”杜勒斯还表示希望在最近的将来和鸠山一郎会晤。
    值得注意的是远东美军总司令赫尔十三日在东京的外国记者俱乐部的宴会上发表了一篇调子与杜勒斯一样的声明，他用早已破产的所谓“共产主义威胁”来恫吓日本“不能保持中立，必须重整军备”。东京政治观察家认为赫尔的谈话是对鸠山政府要改善日本对中、苏关系的言论的“训戒”。
