The act of the United States instigating the French authorities to assist the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in a planned kidnapping of overseas Chinese in northern Vietnam is a deliberate attempt to undermine the Geneva Accords on the restoration of peace in Indochina and tramples upon international law and humanitarian principles. The Chinese people express great indignation at this.

The Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference stipulates that the relevant authorities in Indochina must strictly implement "the provisions for guaranteeing the protection of life and property" and "must allow everyone in Vietnam to freely choose the area in which he wishes to live." However, the American aggressor bloc and the French authorities disregarded these solemn provisions and openly dispatched ships and aircraft to the ports of northern Vietnam, colluding with agents of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, using brutal means such as armed threats and hanging corpses "for public display," to kidnap thousands of overseas Chinese to South Vietnam and Taiwan, causing them to lose their property and jobs, suffer displacement and the pain of hunger and disease, and some were even subjected to massacre and persecution, forcing them to serve as cannon fodder in the remnant forces of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

This brutal crime by the American aggressor bloc and the French authorities once again proves to the world that their sabotage of the implementation of the Geneva Accords has reached a point of frantic desperation. Since the Geneva Conference reached an agreement on the restoration of peace in Indochina, the peace-loving people and countries of Asia and the world have been solemnly demanding that the countries concerned strictly abide by and implement all the provisions of the Geneva Accords. However, the American aggressor bloc openly opposes the peaceful aspirations of the people of the world, and is increasingly unscrupulously carrying out conspiracies in Indochina, doing its utmost to obstruct and undermine the implementation of the Geneva Accords, trying to poison the atmosphere of peace in Indochina and turn South Vietnam into an American war base and colony. This is a well-known fact. The persecution of innocent overseas Chinese residing in Vietnam by American aggressors is also to achieve this despicable goal. Therefore, all countries that respect the Geneva Accords and safeguard peace in Indochina cannot sit idly by and watch the United States' reckless actions.

The crimes of the American aggressor bloc in persecuting, plundering, and kidnapping overseas Chinese in Vietnam demonstrate that the internationally recognized norms of international conduct and humanitarian principles have been completely trampled upon by the actions of the American aggressor bloc. Chinese students studying in the United States are imprisoned by the American aggressor bloc like slave owners of the Middle Ages, forbidding them from returning to their country to reunite with their families. The American aggressor army violated the prisoner-of-war agreement in the Korean Armistice Agreement, and in South Korea, directed American-Chiang agents to use the most brutal means to massacre Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who requested repatriation, and finally forcibly kidnapped tens of thousands of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war and sent them to the armies of the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek traitorous cliques to serve as cannon fodder. Now, Chinese nationals have been living peacefully in Vietnam for centuries, and the American aggressor bloc is now kidnapping them to Taiwan and forcing them to be cannon fodder against their motherland, which is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people and any person with a conscience.

As a signatory to the Geneva Accords and a staunch defender of them, our government and people have every right to demand that the French authorities fulfill their obligations and strictly abide by the letter and spirit of the Geneva Accords in their treatment of overseas Chinese in Vietnam. The US government has also clearly guaranteed that it would not undermine the Indochina agreement. Our Foreign Ministry Spokesperson solemnly warned the US and French authorities to immediately stop the crimes of persecuting, plundering and kidnapping overseas Chinese in Vietnam. This demonstrates our government's determination to safeguard peace in Indochina and the relevant agreements, and the Chinese people express their firm support for this solemn and just position of our government.

### 美国嗾使法方当局劫夺越南华侨的罪行

    美国嗾使法方当局劫夺越南华侨的罪行
    美国嗾使法方当局协助蒋介石卖国集团有计划地劫运越南北部华侨的行为，是蓄意破坏日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的协议，并蹂躏了国际公法和人道原则。中国人民对此表示极大的愤怒。
    日内瓦会议最后宣言中规定：印度支那有关当局必须最严格地执行“关于保证维护生命财产的各项条款”，“必须使在越南的每一个人都能自由地选择他所愿意居住的地区”。但是，美国侵略集团和法方当局无视这些庄严的规定，公开派出船舰、飞机到越南北部的港口，伙同蒋介石卖国集团的特务，以武力威胁和悬尸“示众”等残暴手段，把成千的华侨劫运到南越和台湾，使他们丧失财产和职业，遭受流离失所和饥饿、疾病的痛苦，有的并遭受屠杀、迫害，强迫他们到蒋介石卖国集团残余部队做炮灰。
    美国侵略集团和法方当局这种残暴罪行，又一次向全世界证明，他们破坏日内瓦会议协议的实施，已经达到了不择手段的疯狂地步。自从日内瓦会议达成了恢复印度支那和平的协议以来，亚洲以及全世界爱好和平的人民和国家，一直在庄严地要求有关各国严格遵守和执行日内瓦会议协议的所有条款。可是，美国侵略集团公开敌视全世界人民的和平愿望，越来越肆无忌惮地在印度支那进行阴谋活动，极力阻挠和破坏日内瓦会议协议的实施，力图毒化印度支那的和平气氛，把南越变为美国的战争基地和殖民地。这是人所共知的事实。美国侵略者对侨居越南的无辜的华侨的迫害，也是为了实现它这个卑鄙的目的。因此，所有尊重日内瓦会议协议、维护印度支那和平的国家，都不能坐视美国的这种胡作非为。
    美国侵略集团这种迫害、掠夺、劫运越南华侨的罪行，说明文明人类所公认的国际行为准则和人道原则，已被美国侵略集团这种行为蹂躏无余。中国学生在美国留学，美国侵略集团像中世纪的奴隶主一样禁锢他们不许回国与家人团聚。美国侵略军破坏朝鲜停战协定中的战俘协议，在南朝鲜指使美蒋特务用最残暴的手段屠杀要求遣返的朝中战俘，最后并把几万朝中战俘以武力劫走，送交李承晚和蒋介石卖国集团的军队去充当炮灰。现在，中国侨民几世纪来在越南过着和平生活，美国侵略集团竟又绑架他们到台湾去、强迫他们做反对祖国的炮灰，这是中国人民以及任何有良心的人绝对不能容忍的。
    作为日内瓦会议协议的签字国和坚决的维护者之一，我国政府和人民完全有权利要求法方当局履行其所承担的义务，严格遵守日内瓦会议协议的文字和精神来对待在越南的华侨。美国政府对印度支那协议也曾明确的保证不予破坏。我国外交部发言人正告美国和法方当局，要他们立即停止迫害、掠夺、劫运越南华侨的罪行。这表明我国政府维护印度支那和平和有关协议的决心，中国人民对我国政府这种严正的立场表示坚决支持。
