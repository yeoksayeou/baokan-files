    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 23rd: Eight hundred and sixty thousand coal and steel workers in West Germany held a 24-hour general strike on the 22nd. The strike has severely hit the industrial heartland of West Germany, the Ruhr and the Rhine, and has affected the basic industries of the entire West Germany. The workers raised slogans against the military-industrial complex and against the Paris Agreement.
    This strike is the largest strike to occur in West Germany after the war. The direct cause of the strike was to protest the slander of workers by Reusch, the general manager of the Oberhausen steel plant, and to defend the workers' right to participate in the management of factories and mines. In a speech, Reusch slandered the workers' demands for such rights as "workers' blackmail" and attempted to restrict and abolish the workers' rights. A correspondent from "Neues Deutschland" described the Ruhr scene on the eve of the strike, saying: "In factories, mines, and streets, one can see many large banners, such as those against steel trusts and military-industrial complexes, demanding the right for workers to participate in management in all factories and mines, and calling for the defeat of the Paris Agreement."
    After the strike began, it quickly spread to five of the nine states in West Germany and received the support of other workers.

    西德八十六万煤矿和钢铁工人举行总罢工
    【新华社柏林二十三日电】西德八十六万煤矿和钢铁工人二十二日举行二十四小时总罢工。罢工严重打击了西德的工业心脏鲁尔和莱因，并且使整个西德的基本工业受到影响。工人们提出反对军火康采恩和打倒巴黎协定的口号。
    这次罢工是战后在西德发生的最大的一次罢工。罢工的直接起因是抗议奥伯豪森钢铁厂的总经理罗伊希对工人的污蔑，保卫工人参加工厂和矿场管理的权利。罗伊希在一次谈话中把工人对这样权利的要求污蔑为“工人的讹诈”，并且企图限制和取消工人的这种权利。“新德意志报”驻杜塞尔多夫记者描述罢工前夕的鲁尔景象说：“在工厂、矿区和街头上，人们可以看到许多大幅标语，如反对钢铁托辣斯、军火康采恩，要求在一切厂矿中实行工人参加管理的权利，打倒巴黎协定等。”
    罢工开始后迅速波及到西德九个州中的五个州，并且得到了其他工人的声援。
