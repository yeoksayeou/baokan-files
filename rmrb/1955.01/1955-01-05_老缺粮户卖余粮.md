    Old Grain-Deficient Household Sells Surplus Grain
    Lu Lang
    During the days when the "Dawn" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhenze County, Jiangsu Province, sold surplus grain, Hu Huilin, an old cooperative member in his fifties, was particularly busy and always wore a smile on his face.
    Hu Huilin had been farming for more than thirty years, and this was the first time he had been so happy when selling grain!
    In the old days before liberation, poor farmers were not only exploited by landlords and usurers, but also had to suffer at the hands of private merchants when selling grain. Hu Huilin's family of three always lacked half a year's worth of food. After liberation, Hu Huilin was allocated five acres and three fen of land, and life became much better, but because his "foundation was weak," he was still not well-off in terms of food and clothing. He often thought: If I, Hu Huilin, could one day not be short of grain, then I would truly be considered to have turned over a new leaf!
    In the spring of 1954, the agricultural production cooperative was established in the village, and Hu Huilin also joined. After the autumn harvest, the cooperative made a trial calculation of the pre-distribution, and he received a net of four thousand three hundred catties of grain. He calculated that after paying the public grain and setting aside grain for consumption, he would still have more than one thousand catties of surplus grain. This made Hu Huilin extremely happy. He ran to the cooperative's accountant several times to ask: "Will I really receive this much grain?"
    From this incident, Hu Huilin saw the superiority of the agricultural production cooperative and also saw the benefits of implementing the unified purchase and sale of grain.
    The year before last, Hu Huilin joined a mutual aid team and harvested two thousand seven hundred catties of grain. Last April, his family ran out of food. The government supplied him with three hundred catties of rice, and the price never changed. If there had been no unified purchase and sale of grain during last year's major flood, and if the grain had been in the hands of private merchants, who knows how high the grain price would have soared! Because the grain price was stable, he was able to concentrate on production and, together with the cooperative members, harvest more grain and earn more work points.
    Hu Huilin was very happy after calculating this account. He had already discussed with his wife and decided to sell more than one thousand two hundred catties of surplus grain to the state. On the day the cooperative sold surplus grain, before dawn, Hu Huilin, together with the cooperative members, happily rowed boats full of golden rice to the Hengjing grain purchasing station.

    老缺粮户卖余粮
    卢朗
    江苏省震泽县曙光农业生产合作社卖余粮的日子，五十岁的老社员胡惠林忙得特别起劲，脸上老是挂着笑容。
    胡惠林已经种了三十几年的田，卖粮的时候，像这次这样喜在眉头笑在心，还是头一回哩！
    解放前那时节，贫苦农民不但受地主、高利贷者的剥削，卖粮的时候还要挨私商一刀。胡惠林一家三口人，每年总要缺半年的口粮。解放以后，胡惠林分到五亩三分田，日子好过了许多，但是因为“底子枯”，吃穿还是不富裕。他常想：我胡惠林哪天能不缺粮，那就真算翻了身啦！
    一九五四年春天，村里成立农业生产合作社，胡惠林也参加了。秋收以后，社里试算预分，他净得四千三百斤粮食。他算了一算，缴完公粮，留出口粮等，还有一千多斤余粮。这可把胡惠林喜坏了。他三番五次地跑去问社里的会计：“我真的分得到这许多粮食吗？”
    从这件事情，胡惠林看清了农业生产合作社的优越性，也看清了实行粮食统购统销的好处。
    前年，胡惠林加入互助组，收了二千七百斤粮食。去年四月份，家里就没有口粮了。政府供应给他三百斤大米，价格始终没有变动。像去年这样的大水，要是没有实行粮食统购统销，要是粮食掌握在私商手里，粮价还不知道要冲到哪里去呢！由于粮价平稳，他才能够安心生产，同社员们一起多打了粮食，多得了工分。
    胡惠林算过这笔账非常开心，早就同妻子商量好，把一千二百多斤余粮卖给国家。社里卖余粮的那天，天还没有亮，胡惠林就同社员们一起，摇着满载着金黄色稻谷的船只，喜气洋洋地到横泾粮食收购点去了。
