Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, January 20th: According to TASS, at the evening session on the 18th of the Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, D’Astier de la Vigerie, one of the most prominent activists in the French peace movement, spoke.

    D’Astier de la Vigerie pointed out that it is the task of the international peace movement to actively struggle against the remilitarization of West Germany and against the decisions made by the North Atlantic Group Council aimed at preparing for an atomic war. He said that representatives of the French peace movement believe that it is necessary to launch a broad movement against the use of atomic weapons while conducting the struggle against the remilitarization of West Germany. He also pointed out that in order to establish lasting peace in Europe, the unification of Germany must be achieved.

    Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Saillant, spoke. He said that the World Federation of Trade Unions had received suggestions from trade union organizations in France, Germany, Italy, and Finland, requesting the World Federation of Trade Unions to convene a conference of European working people to discuss ways to strengthen the common struggle against German remilitarization, to discuss the struggle for collective security, and to address the economic and social consequences caused by the arms race. These suggestions have been adopted by the Seventh Session of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council held in Warsaw. This conference, which will be held at the end of March in Leipzig, will be a great contribution to disseminating the resolutions of the World Peace Council.

    Belgian representative, Mrs. Isabelle Blume, spoke. She said that the policy of arming West Germany threatens the independence of small countries in Western Europe. The North Atlantic Group Council's decision to hand over atomic weapons to West German militarists further increases this threat. The people of small countries feel this threat and are therefore waging a resolute struggle against the ratification of the Paris Accords and against the arming of West Germany. In this struggle to secure their own safety, they advocate the establishment of a unified, independent, and peace-loving Germany.

    Brazilian representative, Cavalcuti, said in his speech that the decisions of the North Atlantic Group Council have aroused indignation among the Brazilian people. The Brazilian peace movement supports the suggestion of launching a broadly based movement to collect signatures on appeals against atomic weapons. He opposed the US plan to test nuclear weapons in the Antarctic region.

    President of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, Bernini, spoke. He said that the decision to use atomic weapons and the Paris Accords have aroused the indignation of young people all over the world. Young people cannot tolerate the establishment of a new German Wehrmacht and the activity of arming it with atomic weapons. The youth of Hiroshima have issued an appeal to the youth of the world, calling on them to fight against the use of atomic weapons. Bernini said that the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Democratic Youth will hold a meeting in February to discuss the role of youth in the struggle against the threat of atomic war.

    Also speaking on the evening of the 18th were: Austrian representative Scherf, Czechoslovak representative Hromadka, Lebanese representative Tabot, and representative of the International Student Union, Shebang Ding.

    在世界和平理事会常委会扩大会议上
    各国代表反对武装西德和使用原子武器
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社维也纳十九日讯：在世界和平理事会常务委员会扩大会议十八日晚间会议上，法国和平运动的最卓越的活动家之一达斯迪埃—德拉维热里发言。
    达斯迪埃—德拉维热里指出，为反对西德重新军国主义化、反对北大西洋集团理事会所作出的目的在于准备原子战争的决定进行积极的斗争，是国际和平运动的任务。他说，法国和平运动的代表们认为，有必要在进行反对西德重新军国主义化的斗争的同时，发动一个广泛的反对使用原子武器的运动。他还指出，要建立欧洲的持久和平，必须实现德国的统一。
    世界工会联合会总书记赛扬发言。他说世界工联曾经收到法国、德国、意大利和芬兰的一些工会组织的建议，要求世界工联召集一个欧洲劳动人民的会议，来讨论加强共同反对德国重新军国主义化的斗争的办法，讨论争取集体安全和应付军备竞赛在经济和社会方面所引起的后果的办法。这些建议已经被世界工联理事会在华沙举行的第七次会议通过。这个会议将于三月底在来比锡举行，它对于传播世界和平理事会的决议将是一个极大的贡献。
    比利时代表伊莎贝丽·布伦姆夫人发言。她说，武装西德的政策威胁了西欧小国的独立。而北大西洋集团理事会决定把原子武器交给西德军国主义分子的做法，进一步增加了这种威胁。小国的人民体会到这种威胁，所以正在为反对批准巴黎协定、反对武装西德进行坚决斗争。他们在争取自己的安全的这个斗争中，主张建立一个统一、独立、爱好和平的德国。
    巴西代表卡瓦尔库蒂在发言中说，北大西洋集团理事会的决定已经在巴西人民中激起了愤慨。巴西的和平运动支持这样的建议：发起一个有广泛基础的、征集在反对原子武器的呼吁书上签名的运动。他反对美国准备在南极地区试验核子武器的计划。
    世界民主青年联盟主席柏尼尼发言。他说，使用原子武器的决定和巴黎协定，已经引起了全世界青年的愤慨。青年们不能容忍建立新的德国国防军和用原子武器把它武装起来的活动。广岛的青年已经对全世界青年发出呼吁，要他们为反对使用原子武器而斗争。柏尼尼说，世界民主青年联盟执行委员会将在二月举行会议，讨论青年在反对原子战争威胁的斗争中的作用。
    在十八日晚间发言的还有：奥地利代表谢尔夫、捷克斯洛伐克代表赫鲁玛德卡、黎巴嫩代表塔伯特和国际学生联合会代表谢邦定。
