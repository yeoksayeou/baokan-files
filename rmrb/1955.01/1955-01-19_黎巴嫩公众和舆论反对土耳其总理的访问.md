Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, 17th. According to TASS: The Lebanese public and public opinion oppose Turkish Prime Minister Menderes' visit to Lebanon.

　　The Lebanese "News" wrote: "The Lebanese people protest against Menderes' arrival and reject his plans for war and occupation." The newspaper said that many representatives of the working people visited the newspaper's editorial office, expressing their anger at Menderes' intentions and the agreement he reached with Nuri Said. The newspaper emphasized that this agreement is a serious threat to all Arab people. The newspaper said that this provocative war agreement is a step forward for Iraq to join the Turkish-Pakistani pact, and a means of putting pressure on Syria, Lebanon and other Arab countries to force them to join aggressive imperialist plans. Obviously, Menderes' visit is intended to implement the plans of the American aggressors to deepen international tensions and provoke a new world war.

　　Other Lebanese newspapers also condemned Turkey and Iraq's decision to conclude a military treaty when commenting on the Turkish Prime Minister's arrival. "Al Jarida" wrote: "Lebanon is extremely dissatisfied with Iraq's separate agreement with Turkey." "Al Jundi" published an editorial saying: "Lebanon will not participate in the Turkish-Iraqi alliance." The newspaper emphasized: "Our freedom, our security and our sovereignty are more precious to us than any war plan."

　　The statement of the Lebanese Peace Committee published in the Lebanese "News" said that Menderes' visit to Lebanon after the Damascus conference of American diplomats and the Beirut conference of British diplomats is a manifestation of the imperialists' open pressure on Lebanon. The Lebanese Peace Committee calls on all citizens, all parties and groups, and politicians to be vigilant and maintain unity when the country is in danger. The statement calls on everyone to unite closely and oppose dragging Lebanon into military blocs, and to oppose forcing Lebanon to undertake obligations that threaten Lebanon's sovereignty and security and world peace.

    黎巴嫩公众和舆论反对土耳其总理的访问
   【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社贝鲁特十七日讯：黎巴嫩公众和舆论反对土耳其总理曼德列斯到黎巴嫩访问。
    黎巴嫩“消息报”写道：“黎巴嫩人民抗议曼德列斯的到达，并且拒绝他的战争和占领计划。”这家报纸说，许多劳动人民的代表访问了这家报纸的编辑部，表示他们对曼德列斯的意图以及他和努里·赛义德达成的协议感到愤怒。这家报纸强调指出，这个协议是对所有阿拉伯人民的严重威胁。这家报纸说，这个挑衅性的战争协议是伊拉克向加入土耳其—巴基斯坦协定方面前进一步，并且是对叙利亚、黎巴嫩和其他阿拉伯国家施加压力、迫使他们加入侵略性的帝国主义计划的手段。显然，曼德列斯的访问是打算执行美国侵略分子企图加深国际紧张局势和挑起新的世界大战的计划。
    黎巴嫩的其他报纸在就土耳其总理的到达一事发表评论时也谴责了土耳其和伊拉克决定缔结军事条约的行动。“查里达报”写道：“黎巴嫩对于伊拉克单独和土耳其缔结协定极为不满。”“军旗报”发表社论说：“黎巴嫩将不参加土耳其—伊拉克联盟。”这家报纸强调指出：“我们的自由、我们的安全和我们的主权对我们来说比任何战争计划都宝贵。”
    黎巴嫩“消息报”刊载的黎巴嫩和平委员会的声明说，曼德列斯在美国外交官大马士革会议和英国外交官贝鲁特会议之后来访问黎巴嫩，这是帝国主义者公开对黎巴嫩施加压力的表现。黎巴嫩和平委员会号召全体公民、所有政党和团体以及政治家们警惕起来，在这国家面临危险的时候保持团结。声明号召大家紧紧地团结起来，反对把黎巴嫩拖进军事集团，反对强迫黎巴嫩承担起威胁黎巴嫩的主权和安全以及世界和平的义务。
