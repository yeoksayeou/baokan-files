Newly Built "Democracy No. 10" Passenger and Cargo Ship Launched

The Shanghai Jiangnan Shipyard successfully launched a newly built coastal passenger and cargo ship, the "Democracy No. 10," on December 27, 1954. The "Democracy No. 10" is the first and largest coastal passenger and cargo ship manufactured in our country after liberation. Its structure is solid, and it can navigate to various ports along the coast of China even during the thin ice season. It is 80 meters long overall, 14 meters wide, and has a displacement of 2,672 tons, which is more than 1,000 tons greater than the "Minzhong" passenger ship manufactured by the same shipyard not long ago. This ship can accommodate 572 passengers and simultaneously carry 450 tons of goods. The passenger cabins include soft berths, hard berths, recreation rooms, rooms for mothers and infants, bathrooms, heating equipment, ventilation equipment, and complete safety equipment. This coastal passenger and cargo ship was designed by the Shipbuilding Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building. Advanced segmented operation methods were adopted during the manufacturing process, thereby saving manufacturing time. The entire ship is of welded construction, using Soviet welding specifications, and rigorous weld seam inspections were carried out. After launching, the ship will enter the interior decoration stage and will soon be able to participate in coastal passenger and cargo transportation in our country.

    新造“民主拾号”客货轮下水
    上海江南造船厂新造一艘沿海客货轮“民主拾号”于一九五四年十二月二十七日顺利下水。“民主拾号”轮是解放后我国制造的第一艘最大的沿海客货轮，它的结构坚固，在薄冰季节也能航行我国沿海各港口。它的总长八十公尺，宽十四公尺，排水量二千六百七十二吨，比该厂不久前制造的“民众号”客轮的排水量大一千多吨。这艘轮船能容纳五百七十二个旅客，并同时载运四百五十吨物资；客舱内有软席、硬席、文娱室、妇婴室、浴室等，并有暖气设备、通风设备，以及完备的安全设备等。这艘沿海客货轮是第一机械工业部船舶管理局自己设计的。制造过程中采取了先进的分段操作法，因而节省了制造时间，该轮全部是电焊结构，采用的是苏联电焊规格，并严格进行了焊缝的检查。该轮下水后即进入内部的装修工作，不久便可以参加我国沿海的客货运输工作。　（本报上海记者站）
