Pingshun County's Party Member Appraisal Work
    Li Lin Xing Jie Tai Hua

    Editor's Note: The Pingshun County Party Committee of Shanxi Province has adopted the practice of regularly appraising Party members. This is necessary and feasible given the current situation of rural Party organizations. Through regular appraisal, work is reviewed and summarized, criticism and self-criticism are carried out, and a relatively systematic examination is made of the activities of Party members and cadres during a certain period according to the standards for Party members. Furthermore, directions for future efforts are pointed out to them. Doing so regularly rectifies Party discipline, purifies the Party organization, and continuously enhances the ideological consciousness and combat effectiveness of Party members and the Party. However, the following points must be noted during appraisal: Regarding the content of the appraisal, it is not necessary to conduct a comprehensive review and summary of the work and thoughts of every Party member. It is possible to identify issues of a general nature, or a particularly prominent problem of a certain Party member, for examination, analysis, and criticism based on the different circumstances of different periods. The number of appraisals should not be excessive, nor should it be mechanically prescribed. For example, if an annual appraisal is to be conducted at the end of December, there is no need to conduct a fourth-quarter appraisal in November. When learning from this experience, all localities should proceed from their own circumstances. Party organizations that have not held an annual appraisal can hold an annual appraisal first. Party organizations that already have an annual appraisal system can appropriately increase quarterly or semi-annual appraisals. Moreover, it is not necessary to use the term "appraisal"; it can be called regular review and summary of work, or regular examination of the work and thoughts of Party members.
    Before 1950, the Pingshun County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China led rural branches in conducting an annual appraisal of Party members every year. In the process of practice, everyone felt that once-a-year appraisal was too long apart, and it was impossible to educate Party members in a timely manner through practical activities, nor could it improve the ideological level of Party members at any time; at the same time, due to the dispersed rural environment, Party members were often affected by rural capitalist ideas, and individual Party members with wavering wills even degenerated.
    Based on this situation, with the approval of the higher-level Party committee, the Pingshun County Party Committee gradually promoted the work of regularly appraising Party members in rural branches in 1950. So far, this work has gradually formed a system. This system has become an indispensable task for Party organizations in Pingshun County to improve the consciousness of Party members, ensure the unity of thought and will within the Party, and promote various tasks; it is also an important method for regularly examining the specific activities of Party members according to the standards of Communist Party members, and educating and improving the ideological consciousness of Party members. Over the past few years, the work of appraising Party members in the Party organizations of Pingshun County has been carried out quarterly and annually in the process of strengthening the Party's organizational life and in coordination with major political movements.
    Quarterly appraisals are conducted in a timely manner along with the four production seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter each year, to evaluate and summarize the specific performance of each Party member in agricultural production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement. The method of appraisal is generally that the branch committee first makes a work inspection report to all Party members on the work of the current quarter, inspires Party members to carry out criticism and self-criticism, examine themselves, and put forward opinions on improving leadership work, and then formulates a work plan for the next stage. Carrying out appraisal work in this way has greatly helped to eliminate the influence of capitalist ideas within the Party and strengthen the Party's leadership over the mutual aid and cooperative production movement. For example, in the summer appraisal of 1952, all branches in the county focused on criticizing capitalist ideas, which further clarified the direction of rural economic development for all Party members. According to statistics from the four districts of 1, 4, 5, and 7, 533 Party members voluntarily joined mutual aid teams, determined to be good leaders in socialism. After the Dihe Branch conducted its appraisal, Party member Li Chengbao dismissed his hired labor; Party member Shen Shuangcheng also gave up the idea of buying land and lending money, and invested his surplus money in production; Party member Cui Caiming was originally unwilling to be the leader of the mutual aid team, but after the appraisal, he also became active and expressed his willingness to do a good job in the mutual aid team and strive to establish an agricultural production cooperative. As another example, in the spring appraisal of 1954, the Party's class policy in rural areas was implemented, and each branch examined and criticized the erroneous ideas and practices of excluding poor and lower-middle peasants from joining cooperatives. After the appraisal, attention was also paid to carrying out solidarity education among middle and poor peasants. As a result, 111 poor peasant households in the county were readmitted to the cooperatives. A new atmosphere of solidarity and production emerged among poor and middle peasants, new and old cooperative members, agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers. After the Anyang Branch conducted its appraisal, Party members educated the old cooperative members and voluntarily took out six dan of grain from the public accumulation fund to lend to 14 new cooperative members and mutual aid team members who lacked grain, helping them solve the difficulties of the lean season; in addition, they helped five mutual aid teams with 42 man-days of labor, 14 animal-days of labor, and nine pieces of farm tools of various sizes, solving the problems of labor, livestock, and farm tool shortages for these teams.
    In addition to quarterly appraisals, an annual appraisal is also conducted at the end of each year. The method of the annual appraisal is similar to that of the seasonal appraisal, but the content is more systematic and comprehensive. It mainly summarizes, on the basis of the seasonal appraisals, what experiences and lessons the Party branch has gained in leading various tasks over the past year, thereby proposing methods for improvement and a work plan for the next year; at the same time, it enables each Party member to examine his or her thoughts and actions over the past year based on the eight issues of the Party member standards, and finally the branch makes a conclusion for each Party member. Before the year-end appraisal in 1953, the Shannandi Branch Committee first conducted an ideological ranking of the 40 Party members in the township based on the eight issues of the Party member standards; during the appraisal, it used the Party member standards as a weapon, carried out criticism and self-criticism, democratic discussions, and made realistic conclusions for each Party member; finally, it commended five Party members who could lead the masses to complete various tasks by setting an example, and strictly criticized Party member Qin Qishan's erroneous idea of wanting to withdraw from the cooperative and work individually. This not only consolidated the results of previous appraisals over the past year, but also gradually raised the thinking of each Party member to the Party's standards. As many Party members reflected: "The Party branch is really a good school. Regularly appraising Party members allows the Party and the masses to know who is good and who is bad, and it educates Party members to continuously move forward and not fall behind."
    After each major political movement, each branch in Pingshun County also conducts an appraisal of Party members. The general method is: After the County Party Committee accepts the tasks assigned by the higher-level Party Committee, in order to fully utilize the role of Party members, it first convenes a Party representative meeting or an expanded cadre meeting of the county, district, and township to convey and deploy the tasks, and then conducts short-term training for Party members by branch unit, explaining the Party's policies and clarifying specific methods, and then relies on Party members to unite activists and mobilize the masses to complete the tasks. After the movement is over, an appraisal is carried out, commending the advanced, criticizing the backward, and dealing with Party members who have committed serious errors. For example, in the winter of 1953, in the work of unified purchase and sale of grain, because the Party members were trained from top to bottom in advance, everyone's socialist and patriotic ideological consciousness was improved, and 74% of the Party members in the county took the lead in selling more than 868,500 catties of surplus grain, accounting for 15% of the total amount of grain sold in the county. Party members who did not have surplus grain also actively carried out publicity and mobilization work among the masses, leading and driving the masses of peasants throughout the county to overfulfill the task of unified grain purchase. At the end of the movement, the County Party Committee promptly instructed the township branches to evaluate and summarize, and appraise the Party members. The results of the evaluation and appraisal: 1,702 Party members, including Shen Fufang, were commended by the Party and supported by the masses; at the same time, the degenerated elements Li Yulin and Wang Xueli, who had surplus grain but refused to sell it and抢购 grain with the state, were expelled from the Party to educate the entire Party. After the unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth, grain, and oil in 1954, the Party members were also appraised in the same way.
    In order to ensure the results of the appraisal and strengthen the regular supervision and inspection of Party members, the Pingshun County Party Committee paid great attention to improving the Party's organizational life system. Generally, each branch holds a Party group meeting once a month, using the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to examine the performance of Party members in their daily work, in order to regularly maintain the Party's integrity and continuously eliminate all non-proletarian ideas within the Party, so that the erroneous ideas of some Party members can be corrected in time when they are in their infancy. Party member Yang Nongsheng of the Ganhu Branch used to be able to talk but not act. Every time he was criticized, he could admit his mistakes, but he would not correct them. After repeated education in group meetings, he finally corrected this shortcoming. Now, Yang Nongsheng does what he says, and he can often play a leading role. Party member Wang Hushan of the Shikoumen Branch did not get elected as township secretary in the spring of 1954, so he became negative. After repeated education in the Party group meeting, Wang Hushan checked himself against the standards of a Communist Party member, overcame his ideas of fame and gain, and worked actively. In addition, Party members can check the implementation of production plans and promote production in each season by participating in the Party's organizational life on a monthly basis. The Dihe Branch, through the inspection of the group meeting, overcame the slack mood of some Party members who wanted to "rest" after planting, formulated a short-term production plan before summer hoeing, led the masses to repair seven flood prevention canals, dug two dry wells, and each group of the agricultural production cooperative also accumulated 500 dan of fertilizer.
    Over the past few years, Party members in the rural areas of Pingshun County have been educated through repeated appraisals and regular organizational life meetings, and their political awareness and class consciousness have been increasing day by day. So far, all 4,902 rural Party members in the county have universally participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and have become the leading backbone of the agricultural collectivization movement, and have been warmly supported by the masses, so the masses call Party members "locomotives of socialism" and "leaders of socialism."
    How do Party organizations at all levels in Pingshun County lead branches to conduct Party member appraisal work?
    First, do a good job of preparation from top to bottom. Before each appraisal, the County Party Committee and the District Party Committee must first investigate and analyze the common problems existing among Party members, propose the content and methods of the appraisal, determine the conditions for selecting model Party members, and the matters that should be paid attention to in the appraisal. At the same time, the County Party Committee and the District Party Committee must also combine the central work and conduct typical experiments in several different types of Party branches in order to gain experience and guide the appraisal work of Party members throughout the county. The Party branch committees of each township, according to the instructions of the County Party Committee and in combination with the ideological situation of the Party members in the township, formulate a branch appraisal plan; then they conduct deliberation and discussion among all Party members, so that Party members clearly understand the content of the appraisal, correct their attitude, and then begin the appraisal.
    Experience has proved that branches that have done a good job of preparation will carry out the appraisal work smoothly, and Party members will benefit greatly; otherwise, the appraisal work will become a mere formality, and the educational significance for Party members will not be great. In the spring appraisal of 1954, the Dihe Branch, due to sufficient preparation, launched criticism and self-criticism from the beginning of the appraisal, and completed the appraisal work in only two evenings, democratically selecting 22 selfless Party members who actively run the cooperative, and focusing on criticizing the capitalist ideas of three Party members including Shi Youlai. Everyone reflected: "This kind of realistic appraisal is better than attending a Party school once." However, the Fulanyan Branch, because the branch committee did not study beforehand and the Party members did not deliberate, convened a Party member meeting to examine their thoughts and work. As a result, no one spoke for half a day, and the speakers later entangled themselves in some trivial daily life matters, so that the appraisal work did not achieve the expected results and had to be concluded hastily.
    Second, in the appraisal, it is necessary to select good and bad examples, with commendation as the main focus and focusing on criticizing backward Party members, and to conduct comparative education among Party members. Do not entangle the appraisal work in the circle of daily trivial matters. For example, when carrying out the work of unified purchase and sale of grain in the winter of 1953, the County Party Committee通报ed the model deeds of Communist Party members Li Shunda and Wu Houli, who actively ran cooperatives and took the lead in selling surplus grain, and the erroneous behaviors of Wang Xueli and Guo Wuze, who resisted the unified purchase of grain, to the whole county as a mirror to help each Party member check their own thoughts and behaviors. The vast majority of township branches also selected good and bad typical examples among the Party members in their own townships for discussion. This approach effectively educated the Party members. In the spring appraisal last year, the Shannandi Branch focused on criticizing the erroneous behavior of Party member Sang Rifang, who did not participate in the mutual aid team and bought land to develop the rich peasant economy, which not only promoted Sang Rifang himself to make an examination and participate in the mutual aid team, but also educated the Party members of the whole township. In the summer appraisal last year, the Anyang Branch criticized the erroneous behaviors of Wang Laiqun and other four Party members who pretended to be poor and complained to骗取 the state to supply grain, and after they returned their grain supply certificates. All Party members of the branch also clearly recognized how they should treat the issue of state supply.
    Third, in the process of appraisal, it is necessary to fully promote democracy, carry out criticism and self-criticism; at the same time, Party members who have committed serious errors and have repeatedly refused to correct them should be given appropriate disciplinary actions according to the severity of the circumstances. Only in this way can the self-education of Party members be closely combined with the Party's disciplinary actions. Otherwise, the seriousness and principles of the appraisal will be lost, and Party members will feel that appraisal is the same as not appraising. In the spring appraisal last year, according to statistics from six districts, 1,419 Party members were commended, accounting for 39% of the total number of Party members participating in the appraisal in the six districts; 148 Party members were criticized and educated, accounting for more than 4% of the total number of Party members participating in the appraisal; six Party members were given inner-Party advisory sanctions, and 19 were given warning sanctions. Through repeated Party member appraisals, Pingshun County has also cleared some serious law-breaking and discipline-violating elements and class aliens from the Party, purifying the Party organization. In the summer of 1953, the degenerated element He Xiaomao was expelled, and last year, the class alien Cao Genmao and the speculator Yang Quanbao were expelled, making the Party organization increasingly consolidated politically and organizationally.
    Fourth, the Party appraisal should be closely combined with the mass evaluation and summary. The Party appraisal prepares for the mass evaluation and summary; after the mass evaluation and summary, it can prove whether the Party appraisal is correct, and under the supervision of the masses, further improve the Party's leadership level. In Pingshun County, after each Party appraisal, the Party branch convenes a township mass meeting through the Township People's Government Committee to review and summarize the work of the current quarter and conduct evaluation. In the evaluation process, good Party members will be further loved by the masses, and Party members with shortcomings and problems will also be criticized by the masses, which will greatly help improve Party members' awareness and improve the branch's leadership.
    Fifth, carefully summarize the appraisal work and conduct universal education for Party members. After the appraisal, the County Party Committee should systematically analyze, summarize, and focus on the experiences and lessons learned by the township branches in the appraisal, as well as the existing problems, convene a joint meeting of the District Party Committee and a monthly支部教育大传授 meeting to implement the appraisal summary to each branch. Then, it is conveyed to all Party members through Party lessons and organized for discussion. For example, after the summer appraisal in 1953, each district convened a Party member meeting to convey the report of the County Party Committee, announce the list of model Party members, and read out the decision of the Disciplinary Inspection Committee of the County Party Committee to expel He Xiaomao from the Party. In the discussion, Party members all checked themselves against He Xiaomao's erroneous ideas, liquidated their own capitalist ideas, thereby reversing the right-leaning mood of laissez-faire towards the mutual aid and cooperation movement at that time.
    The Pingshun County Party Committee's specific guidance on the Party member appraisal work is still far from meeting the needs of the movement's development, especially the specific assistance and guidance for backward branches is still very poor. Therefore, although the Party member appraisal work has formed a system in the county, its development is still extremely uneven. In particular, some district and township cadres still lack a sufficient understanding of the significant significance of the appraisal work, and some township branches have neither prepared well before the appraisal nor led it seriously, making the appraisal work a mere formality. Some backward branches cannot correctly carry out criticism and self-criticism in the appraisal, and indiscriminately label people, causing some Party members to lose their initiative and put on a posture of being beaten in the appraisal. Some branches also cannot correctly grasp the focus of the appraisal, entangling the appraisal work in daily trivial matters, and reducing the educational significance of the appraisal. These are all issues that need to be improved in the future.

    平顺县的党员鉴定工作
    李琳  星洁  太华
    编者按：山西平顺县委采用定期鉴定党员的做法，这从今天农村党组织的情况来说是需要的，也是可行的。通过定期鉴定，检查总结工作，开展批评和自我批评，按照党员标准对党员、干部在一个时期的活动，作比较系统的检查，并给他们指出今后努力的方向，这样做，就是经常地整顿党的纪律，纯洁党的组织，不断地提高党员的思想觉悟和党的战斗力。但是，在鉴定时必须注意以下几点：在鉴定内容上，不一定要对每个党员的工作、思想作全面的检查总结，可以根据不同时期的不同情况，找出带有普遍性的问题，或者是某一党员的某一个比较突出的问题，进行检查，分析批判。鉴定的次数也不宜过多，也不必作机械的规定。例如，十二月底要作年终鉴定，十一月就不必作第四季度的鉴定。各地在学习这一经验时，应当从本地区的情况出发，没有举行过年终鉴定的党组织，可以先举行年终鉴定；已有年终鉴定制度的党组织，可以适当增加季度的鉴定或半年的鉴定。而且不一定采用“鉴定”这个名称，可以叫做定期检查总结工作，也可以叫做定期检查党员的工作和思想。
    一九五○年以前，中共平顺县委每年都要领导农村各支部对党员进行一次年终鉴定。在实践的过程中，大家都感到每年一次鉴定，时间相隔较长，不能透过现实活动及时对党员进行教育，不能随时提高党员的思想水平；同时由于处于分散的农村环境，党员常常受到农村资本主义思想的影响，个别意志不坚定的甚至因而蜕化变质。
    根据这种情况，经过上级党委同意，平顺县委于一九五○年就逐步在农村支部中推行了定期鉴定党员的工作。到目前为止，这一工作已逐步形成制度。这一制度，已经成为平顺县党组织提高党员觉悟，保证党内思想意志的统一，推进各项工作不可缺少的一项工作；也是经常用共产党员标准考察党员的具体活动，教育提高党员思想觉悟的重要方法。几年来，平顺县党组织的党员鉴定工作是在加强党的组织生活中，按季按年，并配合历次重要政治运动进行的。
    按季鉴定，是随着每年春夏秋冬四个生产季节，及时评比总结每个党员在农业生产及互助合作运动中的具体表现。鉴定的方法，一般都是由支部委员会首先向全体党员作关于本季度工作检查报告，启发党员开展批评和自我批评，检查自己，并提出改进领导工作的意见，然后订出下一阶段的工作计划。这样进行鉴定工作，对清算党内的资本主义思想的影响，加强党对互助合作生产运动的领导作用很大。如一九五二年夏季的鉴定，全县各支部都集中地批判了资本主义思想，使全体党员进一步明确了农村经济发展方向，根据一、四、五、七等四个区的统计，就有五百三十三名党员自愿参加了互助组，决心要当好社会主义的带路人。底河支部进行鉴定以后，党员李成保就解雇了长工；党员申双成也放弃了买地和放债的主意，把余钱投入了生产；党员崔才明原来不愿当互助组长，鉴定以后也积极起来，表示要搞好互助组争取建立农业生产合作社。又如在一九五四年春季鉴定中，贯彻了党在农村的阶级政策，各支部检查和批判了排斥贫困农民入社的错误思想和做法。鉴定后，又注意在中农贫农中进行了团结教育。因此全县有一百一十一户贫苦农民被重新吸收入了社。贫农中农之间，新老社员之间，农业生产合作社和互助组及个体农民之间出现了团结生产的新气象。安阳支部鉴定后，党员就教育老社员，自动从公积金中拿出六石粮食，借给了十四户缺粮的新社员和互助组员，帮助缺粮户解决了青黄不接的困难；另外又帮助五个互助组人工四十二个、畜工十四个、大小农具九件，解决了这几个组劳畜力和农具缺乏的困难。
    除了按季鉴定以外，每年年终还要进行一次年终鉴定。年终鉴定的方法和季节鉴定相类似，但内容比季节鉴定要系统和全面。它主要是在季节鉴定的基础上，总结党支部一年来对各项工作的领导取得了什么经验和教训，从而提出今后改进的办法和下年度的工作计划；同时，使每个党员根据党员标准八个问题，检查自己一年来的思想和行动，最后由支部给每个党员做出结论。山南底支部委员会，在一九五三年年终鉴定前，就首先根据党员标准的八个问题，把全乡四十个党员进行了思想排队；鉴定中，又以党员标准为武器，开展了批评和自我批评、民主讨论，给每个党员做出切合实际的结论；最后表扬了五个能以身作则带领群众完成各项任务的党员，严格批判了党员秦起善想退社单干的错误思想。这样做不仅巩固了一年来历次鉴定的成果，同时，也逐渐将每个党员的思想提高到党的标准上来。正如许多党员所反映：“党支部真是一座好学校，定期鉴定党员，谁好谁坏党和群众都知道，教育党员不断前进不能落后。”
    在每次较大的政治运动之后，平顺县各支部也要对党员进行一次鉴定。一般的方法是：县委接受了上级党委布置的任务以后，为了充分发挥党员的作用，首先召开党代表会议或县区乡扩大干部会议传达布置，接着就以支部为单位对党员进行短期训练，讲明党的政策，交代清楚具体办法，然后就依靠党员团结积极分子、发动群众去完成任务。运动结束以后，就进行鉴定，表扬先进的，批评落后的，处理犯有严重错误的党员。如在一九五三年冬季粮食统购统销工作中，由于事先由上而下地训练了党员，大家的社会主义和爱国主义思想觉悟有了提高，全县有百分之七十四的党员自动带头卖出余粮八十六万八千五百余斤，占全县售粮总额的百分之十五，没有余粮的党员也在群众中积极进行宣传动员工作，领导和带动全县农民群众超额完成了粮食统购任务。运动结束时，县委又及时指示各乡支部，评比总结，对党员进行了鉴定。评比鉴定的结果：全县有申富芳等一千七百零二名党员受到了党的表扬和群众的拥护；同时把有余粮不卖并和国家抢购粮食的蜕化变质分子李玉林、王学理等开除出党，以教育全党。一九五四年的棉布、粮食和油料的统购统销工作以后，也同样对党员进行了鉴定。
    为了保证鉴定的成果，加强对党员的经常督促和检查，平顺县委十分注意健全党的组织生活制度。各支部一般的都是每月举行一次党的小组会议，运用批评和自我批评的武器，检查党员在日常工作中的表现，以便经常保持党的正气，不断地排除党内一切非无产阶级思想，使某些党员错误思想在萌芽的时候就能及时得到纠正。甘花支部的党员杨弄生过去是能说不能作的，每次受批评都能承认错误，但就不改正；经过小组会议的屡次教育，终于纠正了他的这个缺点。现在杨弄生是说到就做到了，而且经常能起带头作用。石门口支部的党员王虎山，一九五四年春普选时，没有当选乡秘书，他就消极起来，经过党的小组会议多次的教育，王虎山用共产党员的标准对照着检查了自己，克服了名利思想，工作积极了。此外党员按月过党的组织生活，还可以检查生产计划的执行，推动各季节的生产。底河支部通过小组会的检查，就克服了下种后某些党员想“歇一歇”的松懈情绪，订出了夏锄前的短期生产计划，领导群众修了七道防洪渠，打了两眼旱井，农业生产合作社的每个小组还积了五百担肥。
    几年来，平顺县农村中的党员经过历次鉴定和经常的组织生活会议的教育，政治认识和阶级觉悟日益提高。到目前为止，全县四千九百零二名农村的党员，普遍参加了互助合作组织，并成为农业合作化运动的领导骨干，得到群众热烈拥护，因之群众称党员为“社会主义的火车头”、“社会主义的带路人”。
    平顺县的各级党组织是如何领导支部进行党员鉴定工作的呢？
    第一、自上而下地做好准备工作。县委和区委在每次进行鉴定以前，首先要调查分析党员中存在的普遍性的问题，提出鉴定的内容和作法，确定评选模范党员的条件和在鉴定中应该注意的事项。同时县委、区委还要结合中心工作，深入几个不同类型的党支部进行典型试验，以便取得经验，指导全县党员的鉴定工作。各乡党支部委员会，根据县委指示结合本乡党员的思想情况订出支部鉴定方案；然后在全体党员中进行酝酿讨论，使党员清楚了解鉴定的内容，端正态度，才开始进行鉴定。
    经验证明：凡是准备工作做的好的支部，鉴定工作进行得就顺利，党员获益也大；反之，鉴定工作就会流于形式，对党员的教育意义也不大。底河支部在一九五四年春季鉴定中，由于准备充分，从鉴定开始的时候，就展开了批评和自我批评，只用了两个晚上的时间，就做完了鉴定工作，民主评选出二十二个大公无私积极办社的党员，重点批判了石有来等三个党员的资本主义思想。大家反映：“这样实事求是的鉴定，真顶住上一回党校了。”而芣兰岩支部，由于事前支部委员会没有研究，党员没有进行酝酿，就召开党员大会，检查思想和工作，结果半天没有人发言，后来发言的也是纠缠于日常一些生活琐事，使鉴定工作没有得到预期的效果，不得不草率结束。
    第二、鉴定中要选择好坏典型，以表扬为主、重点批判落后的党员，在党员中进行对比教育，不要把鉴定工作纠缠在日常琐事的圈子里。如在一九五三年冬季进行粮食统购统销的工作时，县委就把共产党员李顺达、武侯梨积极办社并带头卖余粮的模范事迹和王学理、郭五则抗拒粮食统购的错误行为通报全县，作为一面镜子，帮助每个党员对照自己的思想和行为进行检查。绝大多数乡支部也都在本乡党员中选择了好坏典型事例进行讨论。这样的做法，有效地教育了党员。山南底支部在去年春季鉴定中，重点批判了党员桑日芳不参加互助组，买地发展富农经济的错误行为，不但推动桑日芳自己作了检查，参加了互助组，同时也教育了全乡党员。安阳支部在去年夏季鉴定中，批判了王来群等四个党员装穷叫苦骗取国家供应粮食的错误行为以后，他们退交了粮食供应证。全支部党员也都明确认识了应该怎样对待国家供应的问题。
    第三、在鉴定过程中，要充分发扬民主、开展批评和自我批评；同时对犯有严重错误、屡教不改的党员，要分别情节轻重，给以适当的纪律处分。只有这样，才能把党员的自我教育和党的纪律处分紧密结合起来。否则就会失去鉴定的严肃性和原则性，使党员感到鉴定和不鉴定一个样。去年春季鉴定中，据六个区的统计，受到表扬的党员有一千四百一十九名，占六个区参加鉴定的党员总数的百分之三十九；受到批评教育的党员有一百四十八名，占参加鉴定党员总数的百分之四强；受到党内劝告处分的六名，警告处分的十九名。平顺县经过历次党员鉴定，也清洗了一些严重的违法乱纪分子和阶级异己分子出党，纯洁了党的组织。一九五三年夏季开除了蜕化变质分子何小毛，去年又开除了阶级异己分子曹根毛，投机分子杨全保等。使党的组织从政治上组织上日益巩固。
    第四、党内鉴定应和群众性评比总结紧密结合起来。党内鉴定给群众性的评比总结做好了准备工作；经过群众性的评比总结又可以证明党内鉴定是否正确，在群众的监督下，进一步提高党的领导水平。平顺县在每次党内鉴定结束后，党支部就通过乡人民政府委员会召开全乡群众大会检查总结本季度工作，并进行评比。在评比过程中，好的党员就会进一步受到群众的热爱，有缺点有毛病的党员也会受到群众的批评，这样，对于提高党员觉悟、改进支部领导有很大的作用。
    第五、认真总结鉴定工作，对党员进行普遍的教育。鉴定以后，县委要把各乡支部在鉴定中总结起来的经验和教训，以及存在的问题有重点地系统地进行综合分析，加以总结，召开区委联席会议和每月的支部教育大传授会议，把鉴定总结贯彻到各支部。再通过党课传达到全体党员中，并组织讨论。如在一九五三年夏季鉴定后，各区都召开了党员大会，在会上传达了县委的报告，公布了模范党员名单，宣读了县委纪律检查委员会关于开除何小毛党籍的决定。党员在讨论中，都对照何小毛的错误思想检查了自己，清算了自己的资本主义思想，从而扭转了当时对互助合作运动放任自流的右倾情绪。
    平顺县委对党员鉴定工作的具体指导还远远赶不上运动发展的需要，特别是对于落后支部的具体帮助和指导做的还很差。因此党员鉴定工作，虽然在全县已经形成制度，但发展的还极不平衡。特别是有些区乡干部，直到现在仍对鉴定工作的重大意义认识不足，部分乡支部，在鉴定前既没有很好准备，鉴定中也没有认真领导，使鉴定工作流于形式。有一些落后支部在鉴定中不能正确地开展批评和自我批评，乱戴帽子，致使一些党员失去自觉性，在鉴定中摆起挨打的架子。有的支部还不能正确地掌握鉴定的中心，把鉴定工作纠缠在日常琐事里，降低了鉴定的教育意义。这些都是需要今后努力改进的。
