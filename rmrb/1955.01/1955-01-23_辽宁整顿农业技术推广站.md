    Liaoning Rectifies Agricultural Technology Extension Stations
    Liaoning Province has now established more than 370 agricultural technology extension stations, more than 200 animal husbandry and veterinary stations, and more than ten specialized technology extension stations for tussah silk, fruit trees, etc. Eighty percent of the province's administrative regions have technical station organizations, with more than 3,700 various technical cadres. Last year, the more than 700 administrative villages guided by these agricultural technology extension stations generally had crop yields 10 to 20 percent higher than neighboring villages; agricultural production cooperatives or mutual aid teams under key guidance had yields 20 to 30 percent higher than other cooperatives and teams.
    With the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the broad masses of farmers universally demand new technical guidance. Liaoning Province is currently working to rectify, consolidate, and improve existing agricultural technology extension stations, expanding the guidance scope of each station from three or two key villages to the entire district, and merging other specialized stations into comprehensive agricultural technology extension stations to strengthen technical guidance for agricultural production.

    辽宁整顿农业技术推广站
    辽宁省现已建立三百七十多处农业技术推广站，二百多处畜牧兽医站和十余处柞蚕、果树专业技术推广站，全省百分之八十的行政区都有了技术站的组织，并拥有三千七百多名各种技术干部。去年这些农业技术推广站指导的七百多个行政村，各种庄稼产量一般都高于邻村百分之十到二十；重点指导的农业生产合作社或互助组则高于其他社、组百分之二十到三十以上。
    随着互助合作运动的发展，广大农民普遍地要求新的技术指导，辽宁省目前正着手整顿和巩固提高现有农业技术推广站，使各站的指导范围由三、两个重点村扩大到全区，将其他专业站合并成为综合性的农业技术推广站，来加强对农业生产的技术指导。（刁春堂）
