Xinhua News Agency, Rome, January 24th: A grand rally was held in Florence on January 23rd to celebrate the 34th anniversary of the founding of the Italian Communist Party. The General Secretary of the Communist Party, Togliatti, delivered a speech at the meeting.

　　Togliatti said that in Italy, "some people want to destroy the foundation of a democratic country by persecuting advanced workers," and "want to eliminate the peace of the Italian people through international actions arranged by the heads of imperialism, and pose a threat of atomic war to all mankind."

　　Togliatti continued, "Our party's national congress has called on all good people to unite to defend freedom, peace, and the rights of the people. I now reiterate this call to the Christian Democratic Party."

　　Referring to the recent statement by Fanfani, the secretary of the Christian Democratic Party, expressing his willingness to organize a peace movement (he apparently wanted to use such a movement to counter the movement initiated by peace supporters), Togliatti stated: The Communist Party demands that the use of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction be condemned as a crime; the Communist Party opposes the establishment of military blocs and the revival of German militarism; demands the establishment of an order of coexistence among all countries; the Communist Party advocates the recognition of the People's Republic of China; the removal of obstacles to trade and cultural exchanges between East and West; and guarantees of freedom for workers in enterprises. He said that this is the concrete basis for action that we suggest the leaders of the Christian Democratic Party accept.

　　Togliatti concluded that in order to respond to the anti-communist offensive, "the people of the whole country must be united in a great front to defend freedom, guarantee peace, and open up a bright socialist future for Italy."

    在庆祝意大利共产党成立三十四周年集会上
    陶里亚蒂号召团结全国人民保卫自由和平
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社罗马二十四日讯：一月二十三日，佛罗伦萨举行了隆重集会，庆祝意大利共产党成立三十四周年。共产党总书记陶里亚蒂在会上发表了演说。
    陶里亚蒂说，意大利现在“有人想以迫害先进工人来摧毁民主国家的根基”，并且“想靠帝国主义头子所安排的国际行动来消灭意大利人民的和平，并且给全人类造成原子战争的威胁”。
    陶里亚蒂接着说，“我们党的全国代表会议曾经号召所有善良的人团结起来保卫自由、和平和人民的权利，我现在特别向天主教民主党再次重申这个号召。”
    在谈到天主教民主党书记范范尼最近表示愿意组织和平运动（他显然是想用这样的运动来对抗和平拥护者所发起的运动）的声明时，陶里亚蒂表明：共产党要求把使用原子武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器作为一种罪行而加以谴责；共产党反对建立军事集团和复活德国军国主义；要求建立各国共处的秩序；共产党主张承认中华人民共和国；消除东西方贸易和文化交流的障碍；保障企业中工人的自由。他说，这就是我们建议天主教民主党领袖们接受的具体的行动基础。
    陶里亚蒂最后说，为了回答反共产主义的进攻，“必须把全国人民团结在一个伟大的战线里，来保卫自由，保证和平，为意大利开辟光辉的社会主义前途。”
