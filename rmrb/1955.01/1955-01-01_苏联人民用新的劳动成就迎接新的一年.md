    Soviet People Greet the New Year with New Labor Achievements
    [From Our Correspondent] Many industrial and transportation sectors in the Soviet Union have completed their 1954 plans ahead of schedule. The industrial sectors that have already completed their annual production plans include: the Soviet Ministry of Power Stations, the Ministry of Building Materials Industry, and the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, among others. The Soviet maritime and inland river transport departments and the railway transport system have completed their annual cargo turnover and transport volume plans.
    Soviet Deputy Minister of Consumer Goods Industry, Mirotvortsev, published an article in "Izvestia" on December 26, stating that the factories under the Soviet Ministry of Consumer Goods Industry had already completed the 1954 total output value plan ahead of schedule on December 17. The output in 1954 increased by 59 percent compared to 1950. The quality of products has also improved, and the variety of goods has increased.
    Soviet agriculture achieved new successes in 1954. Although in this year, Ukraine, the Urals, some states in the Volga River basin, and other states in the southern region encountered very unfavorable climatic conditions, the total national grain procurement volume by December 5 still increased by 271 million poods compared to the same period in 1953. The grain procured in the Siberian region more than doubled compared to 1953, and the grain production in the Altai Krai nearly quadrupled compared to 1953. One hundred and twenty-four new, large state-owned grain farms have been established on the virgin lands in Kazakhstan, the Urals, the Volga River basin, and the North Caucasus, and more than 300 new state-owned farms will be established. More than 17 million hectares of virgin and fallow land were reclaimed in 1954, while the original plan was to reclaim only 13 million hectares. In 1954, 150,000 skilled workers, engineers, technicians, agronomists, and other agricultural experts from machine tractor stations and state-owned farms actively and voluntarily participated in the work of reclaiming wasteland. As a result of sowing on the wasteland in the Altai and Krasnoyarsk Krais, Novosibirsk Oblast, Omsk Oblast, and Kurgan Oblast, an additional 175 million poods of grain have been obtained. By November 1, 1954, the state had purchased and acquired 1,131,100 tons more potatoes and more than 437,000 tons of vegetables than in 1953.
    In just nine months of 1954, agriculture received 134,000 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower), 81,000 trucks, 26,000 grain combine harvesters, more than 19,000 tractor mowers and automatic mowers, and a large number of other agricultural machines.
    In terms of livestock, as of October 1, 1954, the increases compared to October 1, 1953, were as follows: 1.5 million dairy cows, 3.4 million pigs, and 2.6 million sheep. Therefore, by November 1, 1954, there were 233,300 tons more meat and 669,000 tons more milk than in 1953.

    苏联人民用新的劳动成就迎接新的一年
   【本报讯】苏联许多工业和运输部门提前完成一九五四年计划。已经提前完成全年生产计划的工业部门包括：苏联电站部、建筑材料工业部、石油工业部等。已经完成全年货物周转和载运量计划的有：苏联的海上、内河航运部门和铁路运输系统。
    苏联日用工业品部副部长米罗特伏尔采夫十二月二十六日在“消息报”发表文章说：苏联日用工业品部所属各工厂已经在十二月十七日提前完成了一九五四年的总产值计划。一九五四年的产量比一九五○年增加了百分之五十九。产品的质量也改善了，货物的品种也增多了。
    苏联农业在一九五四年内获得了新的成就。虽然在这一年内，乌克兰、乌拉尔、伏尔加河流域的一些州和南方地区的其他各州遇到了十分不利的气候条件，但到十二月五日止，全国的谷物总收购量仍比一九五三年同一时期增加了二亿七千一百万普特。西伯利亚地区收购的谷物比一九五三年增加了一倍以上，阿尔泰边疆区的谷物生产量几乎增加到一九五三年的四倍。在哈萨克斯坦、乌拉尔、伏尔加河流域和北高加索的生荒地上已成立了一百二十四个新的巨大的国营谷物农场，并且还要成立三百多个新的国营农场。一九五四年开垦了一千七百多万公顷的生荒地和熟荒地，而原定计划只开垦一千三百万公顷。在一九五四年，机器拖拉机站和国营农场的十五万名熟练工人、工程师、技术员、农艺师和其他农业专家都积极自愿地参加了开垦荒地的工作。由于在阿尔泰和克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边疆区、新西伯利亚州、鄂木斯克州和库尔干州的荒地上进行了播种，如今又多得了一亿七千五百万普特的谷物。到一九五四年十一月一日，国家比一九五三年多征购和收购了一百一十三万一千吨的马铃薯，四十三万七千吨以上的蔬菜。
    仅仅在一九五四年的九个月内，农业已得到了十三万四千架拖拉机（每架以十五匹马力计算）、八万一千辆载重汽车、二万六千架谷物联合收割机、一万九千多架拖拉割草机和自动割草机，以及大量的其他农业机器。
    在牲畜业方面，到一九五四年十月一日止，比一九五三年十月一日增加数如下：乳牛一百五十万头、猪三百四十万头、羊二百六十万头。因此，到一九五四年十一月一日，已比一九五三年增加了二十三万三千吨的肉类和六十六万九千吨的牛奶。
