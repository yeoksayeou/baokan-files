Where Do the Merits and Demerits of the "New Redology School" Lie?
    Li Xifan Lan Ling

    In many articles criticizing the "New Redology School," especially Yu Pingbo's idealistic academic thought, the errors in the "New Redology School's" stance, viewpoints, and methods have already been exposed. However, those who have been influenced by the "New Redology School" and blindly worship "New Redologists" ask with regret for the "New Redologists": Haven't the "New Redology School" achieved anything in the past thirty years? Haven't they made many contributions to textual research on *Dream of the Red Chamber*? Especially Yu Pingbo, the "authority" of the "New Redology School," hasn't he written the famous "*Dream of the Red Chamber Differentiation"* and "*Dream of the Red Chamber Research*"? Can their achievements be written off? Is the "New Redology School" more meritorious than blameworthy, or more blameworthy than meritorious? Faced with these questions, it is necessary to give the "New Redology School," especially Yu Pingbo, a fair reckoning.

    The "New Redology School," being called "New," of course opposes and criticizes the "Old Redology School." Hu Shi and Yu Pingbo jointly divided "Old Redology" into the riddle-guessing school and the leisure school, criticizing their far-fetched interpretations or unserious attitudes of using it as a topic of conversation, as well as those vulgar and boring people who indulge in fantasies of the Grand View Garden's romantic affairs and prosperity. Regardless of whether the critic's own method is more clever than the criticized, and even if some places are absurd, they still point out some genuine absurdities of certain "Old Redologists." This criticism is somewhat beneficial, which can be said to be the first small achievement of the "New Redologists."

    The so-called "New Redology School's" textual research on certain historical facts is actually only excavating the problems that predecessors have already discovered and explaining them further, and often the materials added by their own textual research have a strong subjective color and cannot be considered very credible arguments. Especially Yu Pingbo's so-called achievements in textual research are essentially the expansion and enrichment of what Hu Shi left behind, and he himself has not raised any new questions. Taking Cao Xueqin's family background as an example, Hu Shi only examined from books such as "*Records of Paintings on Yangzhou Pleasure Boats*," "*Bingchen Notes*," and "*Snow Bridge Poetry Talks*" that Cao Xueqin was the grandson of Cao Yin and the son of Cao Fu (another saying is that Cao Fu was Cao Yin's adopted son, not born of his own, but whether these two sayings are true or false will not be discussed here). Yu Pingbo simply inherited this statement without adding anything. Another example is the issue of the last forty chapters of the sequel. Hu Shi found the clue to the sequel from Yu Yue's "*Small Floating Plum Idle Talk*," which said, "After the eightieth chapter of *Dream of the Red Chamber*, they were all supplemented by Lanshu," and Yu Pingbo confirmed this from the comparison of the contents, making the problem clearer. Although Yu Pingbo did this with the purpose of negating the last forty chapters, it at least made people realize that the 120-chapter version of *Dream of the Red Chamber* was not the work of one person, and pointed out that certain details of the sequel had a feudal utilitarian color. Therefore, it is somewhat beneficial for understanding the entire *Dream of the Red Chamber*. This can be said to be the second small achievement of the "New Redologists."

    Hu Shi and Yu Pingbo, based on the Rouge Inkstone comments and other materials, collated the incomplete state of the original manuscript of the first eighty chapters, making it easier for readers to distinguish those that were not Cao Xueqin's original works. They also verified from the Rouge Inkstone comments that there were original manuscripts of Cao Xueqin after the eightieth chapter that were not finished and lost. However, they often speculated and exaggerated the clues provided by the Rouge Inkstone comments to conform to their purpose of negating the last forty chapters. Although the Rouge Inkstone comments are quite messy and have some formalistic shortcomings, and cannot represent the author's thoughts, it is credible that there are some remaining manuscripts after the eightieth chapter based on the Rouge Inkstone comments. Yu Pingbo should have continued to make more beneficial achievements in this regard, but unfortunately he went astray here, turning the Rouge Inkstone comments into a magic weapon for promoting mysticism. But we also believe that being able to put forward some clues on this issue can still be said to be the third small achievement of the "New Redology School."

    These are the three actual achievements that the "New Redology School" has contributed in the past thirty years, but the merits of the so-called "New Redology School," especially Yu Pingbo, are only this much.

    For this reason, it must also be emphasized that these achievements of the "New Redology School," especially Yu Pingbo, were not made consciously, but were formed objectively and unconsciously under the guidance of incorrect views in order to achieve the purpose of distorting and then negating *Dream of the Red Chamber*. Therefore, they have not been able to draw any positive conclusions on this basis. Therefore, affirming their achievements does not mean affirming the correctness of their research methods. The most important weapon for the "New Redology School" to distort *Dream of the Red Chamber* is the vulgar and trivial "experimentalist" textual research method. If these two issues are confused, it will inevitably cause ideological confusion and make it impossible to identify the characteristics of the "New Redology School."

    Marxist-Leninist literary research work takes the literary work itself as the object of research. Even when studying the writer's thoughts, it should mainly explore and evaluate from the objective thoughts reflected in the work. Studying *Dream of the Red Chamber* must also be studied and explored from its own content in order to draw correct conclusions. Of course, this does not mean that textual research work is not needed. Necessary textual research work is still needed for the study of classical literature. However, textual research work has a certain scope. Textual research on the writer's personal background, the influence of the political, economic, and cultural development of the society at that time on his creation is useful for further elucidating the writer's thoughts, the motive of creation, and the ideological depth reached by the work. For example, it has now been generally confirmed that Cao Xueqin was born into a feudal bureaucratic landlord class, his ancestors lived a luxurious life, and later his family declined and his life was very poor. The image of *Dream of the Red Chamber* and Jia Baoyu to a certain extent contains the generalization of Cao Xueqin's own life experience, which is conducive to understanding Cao Xueqin's thoughts and the content of *Dream of the Red Chamber*. However, historical materials outside the work can only play an auxiliary role in the entire process of elucidating the artistic image of the work, and must never be used to completely replace the analysis and criticism of the work itself. Otherwise, it will become one-sided and even lead to absurd conclusions. The "New Redology School," especially Yu Pingbo, has created no small sins in the research work of *Dream of the Red Chamber* in this way.

    So, where is the fault?

    For thirty years, Yu Pingbo abandoned the work that should have been verified and always turned the cart before the horse, turning *Dream of the Red Chamber* into an object of textual research. Comparing the affairs of the Cao family and the Jia family, dividing the content of *Dream of the Red Chamber* into isolated and accidental phenomena, and exaggerating the extremely individual backward phenomena among them into the theme thought of *Dream of the Red Chamber*. The so-called abstract "theory of color and emptiness" and naturalistic "autobiography theory" were formed in this way. In this way, the realistic *Dream of the Red Chamber* becomes an anti-realistic work.

    Yu Pingbo also completely adopted a cumbersome textual research method to criticize the last forty chapters of *Dream of the Red Chamber*. In the article "The Basis of Gao E's Continuation," he first separates the complete anti-feudal content expressed in the last forty chapters, and then subjectively concocts 108 so-called "basis for the continuation," using this simplest illusion to refute Gao E, and finally completely negates the continuation. Mr. Yu Pingbo formally acknowledges Gao E's contribution to maintaining the tragic ending of *Dream of the Red Chamber*, which made *Dream of the Red Chamber* widely circulated. However, through his cumbersome textual research, he proves to the reader that the continuation is unreasonable, instills a hatred of Gao E, and then achieves a complete negation of the continuation, which invisibly weakens the role of the first eighty chapters.

    However, the fact that the 120-chapter version of *Dream of the Red Chamber* has been circulating for hundreds of years and recognized by the broad masses of people has formed a strong social connection between these two writers. Since the continuation has existed for a long time, Yu Pingbo insists on saying "the continuation is impossible" with his eyes closed. Isn't this a lack of "self-knowledge"? Isn't it deliberately hitting a snag? The facts are exactly the opposite of Yu Pingbo's estimate. In this book *Dream of the Red Chamber*, the broad masses of people do not like its happy ending, but welcome and accept this tragic ending. Yu Pingbo superficially acknowledged Gao E's contribution to maintaining the tragic ending, but he did not see that this reflected the demands of the broad masses of people, and to a greater extent, he harbored a hostile emotion towards this demand. However, the broad masses of people recognized the connection between the 120-chapter version of *Dream of the Red Chamber*. It is precisely because of this that those continuations of *Dream of the Red Chamber*, *Dream of the Red Chamber Rounding Dream*, *Dream of the Red Chamber Recovery Dream*, and *Ghost Dream of the Red Chamber* cannot be circulated. The true judge of a literary work is the people, and the recognition of the people is the highest standard for evaluating Gao E. Although Yu Pingbo "exposed" the "Western mirror" of the continuation more than thirty years ago, and attacked the last forty chapters with the first eighty chapters everywhere, forcing Gao E and Xueqin to separate. But for more than thirty years, the broad masses of people have ignored Yu Pingbo's declaration of war and still understood *Dream of the Red Chamber* according to the positive aspects of Gao E's continuation, silently giving Yu Pingbo a strong and silent counterattack.

    Yu Pingbo also used a cumbersome textual research method to criticize the three main characters of *Dream of the Red Chamber*: Baoyu, Daiyu, and Baochai. Yu Pingbo spared no effort to piece together evidence of Cao Xueqin's poverty in his later years from the Rouge Inkstone comments and the poems given to Xueqin by Duncheng, and gladly determined that Baoyu became a monk after being poor. The purpose is to obliterate the social reasons for Baoyu's departure and distort the departure into being forced by poverty rather than a firm rebellion against feudal society. Yu Pingbo's textual research on the images of Dai and Chai is also the same. Using a cumbersome textual research method, he searched for the description of Qin Keqing in the fifth chapter: "Bright and charming seems like Baochai, graceful and charming like Daiyu, milk name 'combining beauty'," extracted the sentence "Dream of the Red Chamber of sadness for gold and jade" from the introduction to the *Dream of the Red Chamber* song, painstakingly fantasized about the seating arrangement of the "Longevity Yi Hong Ladies' Night Banquet," clung to the Rouge Inkstone comment "Chai and Yu are two names, but one person, this is a magical pen," and created the "Theory of the Unity of Chai and Dai," reconciling the conflicting social content and completely negating the anti-feudal positive significance of *Dream of the Red Chamber*.

    This textual research method is also fully revealed in elucidating the traditionality and expression methods of literature. Yu Pingbo isolatedly found individual plots from *Dream of the Red Chamber* and compared them with previous classical works in a far-fetched way, believing that the plot and theme of *Dream of the Red Chamber* were "derived from" books such as "*Zhuangzi*," "*Book of Songs*," "*Spring and Autumn Annals*," "*Zuo Zhuan*," "*Chu Ci*," "*Jin Ping Mei*," "*Journey to the West*," "*Water Margin*," and "*Romance of the West Chamber*." Even Lin Daiyu's burial of flowers and the poem of burying flowers were derived from Tang Liuru, and Xue Baochai's willow catkin poem was recreated from the affairs of Song Hou Meng. Examples like this are everywhere in Yu Pingbo's entire works on *Dream of the Red Chamber*. Yu Pingbo dogmatically said that such examples "cannot be explained as coincidences," but we can explain them as extremely absurd "far-fetched interpretations." In order to satisfy the purpose of verifying the "traditionality" of *Dream of the Red Chamber*, Yu Pingbo sacrificed the brilliant realism and popular tradition of Chinese classical literature at all costs.

    It can be seen that Yu Pingbo's textual research method is completely a subjective textual research method. He only makes dogmatic conclusions based on individual and one-sided factual phenomena. This "brilliant creation" of the "experimentalist" textual research method is the basic method that runs through all of Yu Pingbo's works on *Dream of the Red Chamber*.

    Upon closer inspection, Yu Pingbo did not enrich what Hu Shi had verified, but was good at picking up Hu Shi's leftovers, expanding them, and inflating them into his own articles. For example, Hu Shi discovered the clue that the last forty chapters of *Dream of the Red Chamber* were supplemented by Gao E, so Yu Pingbo wrote four long articles, "On the Impossibility of the Continuation," "Distinguishing that the Chapter Titles of the Last Forty Chapters Are Not Original," "The Basis of Gao E's Continuation," and "Criticism of the Last Forty Chapters," to confirm this. This is probably the "two beauties in one" of Hu Shi and Yu Pingbo using the "brilliant" "experimentalist" textual research method in the research work of *Dream of the Red Chamber*, right?

    Not only that, but Yu Pingbo is also good at picking out one or two sentences from the works of his predecessors that fit his own "interests," evolving them into long articles, so that readers believe that he did not say so, but that people before him said so, in order to deceive readers. The most obvious is that he used Jiang Shunyi's "*Miscellaneous Notes on Reading Dream of the Red Chamber*," which said, "Just like the white-haired palace ladies weeping and talking about the Tianbao era, those who do not know only admire its splendor and magnificence, and those who have a heart see it as strands of blood," "What is recorded in *Dream of the Red Chamber* is all the words of boudoir daughters, ... what is called destruction? What is called slander?" to write the 6,000-7,000-word "The Style of *Dream of the Red Chamber*," and the style theory of "resentment without anger" was "transformed and reborn" from it. We cannot but "admire" how Yu Pingbo is good at accepting and enriching these worst traditions. This is closely related to his method of drawing huge conclusions from the textual research of trivial facts. From this perspective, Yu Pingbo is not a precise textual research expert, but a conjurer who catches shadows like a magician.

    Here, we cannot help but make a "slight criticism" of Wen Huaisha's vulgar mutually flattering remarks in the "Postscript" to "Dream of the Red Chamber Research." In all of Yu Pingbo's works on *Dream of the Red Chamber*, we not only did not see his "serious attitude" towards the "historical heritage of Chinese literature" and his "historical obsession approaching the degree of the scholars of Qianlong and Jiaqing interpreting the classics" to *Dream of the Red Chamber*, but rather real and unadulterated subjective fabrications and forced interpretations. Wen Huaisha may say that we are also "overly biased," but we want to further understand the "intention" of Mr. Yu that he praised and expose his subjective idealist textual research method.

    Treating the literary work *Dream of the Red Chamber* as an object of textual research, dissecting the complete artistic image into individual life phenomena, limiting oneself to superficial observation and collecting scattered facts, instead of grasping it from the whole, this is the characteristic of Yu Pingbo's subjective idealist metaphysical textual research method. Lenin once said, "If facts are not grasped from the whole, not from the connections, if they are fragmentary and randomly taken, then they are only toys, or something worse," and the result will inevitably lead to mysticism. The result of Yu Pingbo's thirty years of research on *Dream of the Red Chamber* proves this point. He announced to people that the realistic *Dream of the Red Chamber* was a "nightmare in the Chinese literary world," "the more you study it, the more confused you become," and that "ordinary people" can only "sigh in vain" about it. This is the only conclusion reached by the "materialist historical viewpoint" praised by Wen Huaisha, who "holds a serious attitude towards the historical heritage of Chinese literature" - the mystical "unknowable" conclusion. This is the "outstanding achievement" of Yu Pingbo's textual research method, and also the inevitable ending of the epistemology and methodology of experimentalism of "bold assumptions and careful verification."

    Is this ending accidental? Is it like some people say that his textual research method has nothing to do with his views? No. Yu Pingbo's evaluation of *Dream of the Red Chamber* sometimes says it is "Xueqin's autobiography," sometimes says it is the "concept of color and emptiness," and is contradictory everywhere, and the more he says it, the less satisfactory it is. Because idealists always look at problems from a one-sided and partial perspective, and cannot see the interconnectedness between the whole, so it is impossible to correctly understand a thing. Yu Pingbo's mistakes prove that idealism cannot solve any problems at all.

    Here, we can easily answer, what has the "New Redology School," especially Yu Pingbo, done in the research of *Dream of the Red Chamber*? We believe that they used the loophole that *Dream of the Red Chamber* was not written by one person, used the negative and backward side of *Dream of the Red Chamber*, used the cumbersome textual research method of "experimentalism" to replace literary criticism, distorted and negated the realistic achievements of *Dream of the Red Chamber*, promoted reactionary idealist viewpoints and methods, and led readers to the "Illusory Realm of the Great Void" created by Yu Pingbo. Directly resisted the dissemination and application of Marxism-Leninism in the field of classical literature research. Their entire crime lies here. This is the misfortune of the great classical writer Cao Xueqin, the misfortune of the great classical masterpiece *Dream of the Red Chamber*, the misfortune of the excellent classical literary heritage of the motherland, and the misfortune of the broad masses of readers. Therefore, the slight achievements of the New Redology School cannot be offset by its faults. To liquidate the reactionary views of the "New Redologists," especially Yu Pingbo, is to protect the literary heritage of the motherland. It is completely wrong to confuse such a serious ideological struggle with his individual trivial achievements.
    
    [Note] In our article "Critique of 'Dream of the Red Chamber Research'," we made a partially erroneous evaluation of Yu Pingbo's research on the last forty chapters of *Dream of the Red Chamber*. While affirming his small achievements, we did not discover his purpose of negating the last forty chapters, and lost a keen sense of this cumbersome textual research method. This error is principled, and we have written another article (see "Teaching and Research," No. 11, 1954, People's University School Journal) to correct it. -- The Authors

    “新红学派”的功过在哪里？
    李希凡  蓝翎
    在不少批判“新红学派”、尤其是俞平伯的唯心论的学术思想的文章中，对于“新红学派”的立场、观点和方法的错误实质，都已经揭露出来了。可是受过“新红学派”的影响和盲目崇拜“新红学家”的人，怀着对“新红学家”惋惜的心情在问：难道三十多年来的“新红学派”没有一点成绩吗？他们在红楼梦的考证上不是有很多贡献吗？尤其是“新红学派”的“权威”俞平伯，不是写过有名的“红楼梦辨”“红楼梦研究”吗？他们的成绩能一笔抹杀吗？“新红学派”究竟是功过于罪、罪过于功呢？面对着这种种的疑问，有必要给“新红学派”、尤其是俞平伯，公平地算一算账。
      “新红学派”既称为“新”，当然对“旧红学派”有所反对与批评。胡适和俞平伯，共同地将“旧红学”分为猜谜派与消闲派，批评了他们的牵强附会或借以聊资谈助的不严肃的态度，以及那些想入非非的庸俗无聊的空慕大观园风月繁华的人。不管批评者本人的方法是否比被批评者高明，甚至有些地方荒唐则过之。同时在对“旧红学”的批评中也武断地否定了历来某些对红楼梦正确的或接近正确的见解。但在客观上也指出了确确实实某些“旧红学家”的胡闹。这批评多少是有些益处的，这可说是“新红学家”的第一点小小的功绩。
    所谓“新红学派”对某些历史事实真像的考证，实际上仅仅是将前人已经发现的问题发掘出来，加以进一步地说明而已，而且往往在新增添进去的一些自己考证出的材料中都带有很浓厚的主观主义色彩，不能认为是十分可信的论据。尤其是俞平伯的所谓考证上的成绩，实质上都是胡适唾余的扩大和充实，自己并没有提出任何新的问题来。以曹雪芹的家世而论，胡适仅从“扬州画舫录”、“丙辰剳记”、“雪桥诗话”等书中，考证出曹雪芹是曹寅的孙子、曹頫的儿子（另一说曹頫为曹寅的继子，并非己出，此二说究竟孰是孰非，在此处暂且勿论）。俞平伯只是单纯地继承了这说法，丝毫未增加什么。再如关于后四十回续书的问题。胡适从俞樾的“小浮梅闲话”中“红楼梦八十回以后，俱兰墅所补”一句话找出了续书的线索，俞平伯又从内容的对比上给以证实，使这个问题更加明确起来。尽管俞平伯是怀着否定后四十回的目的而作的，但至少是使人认清楚了百二十回本红楼梦不是一个人的作品，并指出续作的某些细节带有封建的功利主义的色彩，因此，对于认识全部红楼梦多少是有些益处的。这可说是“新红学家”第二点小小的功绩。
    胡适和俞平伯根据脂批和其他材料，校勘出前八十回原稿的残缺情形，使读者较易于辨明那些不是曹雪芹的原作。他们又根据脂批对证出八十回后还有曹雪芹未写完而迷失了的原稿。不过，他们却往往将脂评所提示的线索加以揣想夸大，以符合其否定后四十回的目的。脂批虽相当杂乱，而且有些形式主义的缺点，不能代表作者的思想，但根据脂批加以对证，八十回后还有一些残稿的话，是可信的。俞平伯本应在这方面继续作出更有益的成绩来，可惜他在此却走向了歧路，把脂批变成了宣传神秘主义的法宝。但我们也认为，能在这一问题上提出了一些线索，仍可说是“新红学派”第三点小小的功绩。
    这就是“新红学派”三十年来所贡献出的三点实际的成绩，但是，所谓“新红学派”、尤其是俞平伯的功绩，也仅仅如此而已。
    为此，也必须着重说明，“新红学派”、尤其是俞平伯的这些成绩，并不是自觉地作出的，而是在不正确的观点指导下，为了达到企图歪曲并进而否定红楼梦的目的而客观上不自觉地形成的。所以，他们都没有能够在这基础上得出任何积极的结论。因此，肯定他们的成绩并不等于肯定其研究方法的正确。“新红学派”歪曲红楼梦最重要的武器就是庸俗的、琐细的“实验主义”的考证方法。如果把这两个问题混淆起来，不可避免地会引起思想上的混乱，不能识别“新红学派”的特点。
    马克思列宁主义的文学研究工作是把文学作品本身作为研究的对象，即使研究作家的思想，也主要应该从作品所反映出来的客观思想出发予以探讨和评价。研究红楼梦也必须从其本身进行研究和探讨，才能得出正确的结论。自然，这并不是说不需要考证工作。必要的考证工作，对于古典文学的研究还是需要的。但是，考证工作是有一定范围的。考证出作家个人的身世环境，当时社会的政治、经济、文化的发展情况对其创作所发生的影响，这对于进一步阐明作家的思想、创作的动机、作品所达到的思想深度，都是有用处的。例如，现在大体上已考证出曹雪芹出身于封建官僚地主阶级，先世生活豪华，后来家庭败落了，生活很穷困。红楼梦和贾宝玉的形象在一定程度上就包含着曹雪芹自己生活经历的概括，因而也就有利于理解曹雪芹的思想与红楼梦的内容。但属于作品以外的历史材料，在阐明作品的艺术形象全部的过程只能起辅助作用，绝不能用来完全代替对作品本身的分析与批评，否则就会流于片面，甚至得出荒谬的结论。“新红学派”、尤其是俞平伯，偏偏就是这样地在红楼梦的研究工作上造下了不小的罪过。
    那么，过究竟在哪里呢？
    三十年来，俞平伯抛开了应该考证的工作，始终是本末倒置地把红楼梦变成了考据的对象。把曹家与贾家的事互相比附，把红楼梦的内容分成一个个孤立的偶然的现象，选择其中极个别的落后的现象夸大成红楼梦的主题思想。所谓抽象的“色空观念说”、自然主义的“自传说”等等就是如此形成的。这样，就把现实主义的红楼梦变成反现实主义的作品。
    俞平伯也完全是采用了烦琐的考证方法来批评红楼梦的后四十回。在“高鹗续书底依据”一文中，先把后四十回所表现的完整的反封建内容割裂开来，然后再主观地杜撰出一百零八条所谓“续书的依据”，用这种最简单的幻术来反驳高鹗，最后全部否定续书。俞平伯先生形式上也承认高鹗保持了红楼梦悲剧的结局因而使红楼梦得以广泛流传的功绩。然而通过他烦琐的事实考证，是向读者证明续作存在的不合理，灌输憎恶高鹗的情绪，进而达到对续作的彻底否定，无形中也就削弱了前八十回的作用。
    但是，几百年来百二十回本红楼梦流传的事实，广大人民的承认，已经形成了这两个作家之间的强固的社会联系。续书既已长期存在下来，俞平伯却偏要闭着眼睛硬说“续书不可能”，这不是无“自知之明”吗？不是故意碰钉子吗？事实和俞平伯的估计恰恰相反，在红楼梦这部书上，广大人民并不喜欢它大团圆的结局，而是欢迎并接受了这悲剧的结局。俞平伯从表面上承认了高鹗保持悲剧结局的功绩，而却看不到这是反映了广大人民的要求，更重一点说是对这要求怀着敌视的情绪。可是广大人民承认了百二十回本红楼梦之间的联系。正因如此，才使那些续红楼梦、红楼圆梦、红楼复梦、鬼红楼梦等不得流传。一部文学作品的真正的裁判者是人民，人民的承认是评价高鹗的最高标准。俞平伯尽管在三十多年前就“拆穿了”续书的“西洋镜”，处处用前八十回攻后四十回，强迫高鹗和雪芹分居。但三十多年来，广大人民将俞平伯的宣战书置之于不顾，仍然依照高鹗续作的积极方面去理解红楼梦，默默地给俞平伯一个强有力的无声的回击。
    俞平伯也以烦琐的考证方法对于红楼梦的三个主要人物宝玉、黛玉、宝钗进行批评。俞平伯不惜东拼西凑地从脂评和敦诚赠雪芹的诗中，找出了曹雪芹晚年贫穷的证据，欣然地断定了宝玉系贫穷而后出家。其目的即在于抹煞宝玉出走的社会原因，把出走的事歪曲成为贫穷所迫而不是对封建社会的坚决叛逆。俞平伯对于黛、钗两个形象的考证亦是如此。运用烦琐的考证方法，搜寻出第五回对秦可卿的描写：“鲜艳妩媚有似乎宝钗，风流袅娜则又如黛玉，乳名‘兼美’”，摘出红楼梦曲引子中“悲金悼玉的红楼梦”一句，苦心地幻想出“寿怡红群芳开夜宴”的座次，死抱住“钗玉名虽二人，人却一身，此幻笔也”的一句脂评，创造出“钗黛合一论”，调和了矛盾冲突的社会内容，完全否定了红楼梦的反封建的积极意义。
    这种考证方法在阐发文学的传统性与表现方法上也充分地显露出来。俞平伯从红楼梦中孤立地找出个别情节，与它以前的古典作品，加以牵强附会地对比，认为红楼梦的故事情节，主题都是由“庄子”、“诗经”、“春秋”、“左传”、“楚辞”、“金瓶梅”、“西游记”、“水浒”、“西厢记”等书“脱胎而来”。连林黛玉的葬花事与葬花词也是从唐六如那里脱胎而来，薛宝钗的柳絮词系从宋侯蒙之事翻造而来。诸如此例，在俞平伯关于红楼梦的全部著作中是到处皆是的。俞平伯武断地说，这样的例子绝“不能解释为偶合”，但我们却可把它解释成极端荒唐的“牵强附会”。俞平伯为了满足考证红楼梦的“传统性”的目的，不惜一切地把中国古典文学光辉的现实主义与人民性的传统完全牺牲光了。
    由此可见，俞平伯的考证方法完全是一种主观主义的考证方法。他只依据个别的、片面的事实现象，就武断地作出巨大的结论来。这种对“实验主义”考证方法的“光辉创造”就是贯串在俞平伯关于红楼梦的全部著作中的基本方法。
    细细考察起来，俞平伯对于胡适所考证出的结论，并没有丰富什么，而是善于拾取胡适的唾余，加以扩充，吹涨，变成自己的文章。例如，胡适发现红楼梦后四十回是高鹗补续的线索，于是俞平伯就写了“论续书底不可能”、“辨后四十回底回目非原有”、“高鹗续书底依据”、“后四十回底批评”四篇长文，加以证实。这恐怕就是胡适、俞平伯在红楼梦研究工作中运用“高明”的“实验主义”考证方法的“二美合一”吧？
    不仅如此，俞平伯还善于从前人的著作中，挑剔出一两句合乎自己“兴趣”的话，演化成长篇大文，让读者相信并不是他如此说，而是以前的人就如此说，以此蒙混读者。最明显的是，他利用江顺怡的“读红楼梦杂记”中所说的“正如白发宫人涕泣而谈天宝，不知者徒艳其纷华靡丽，有心人视之皆缕缕血痕也”“红楼梦所记皆闺房儿女之语，……何所谓毁？何所谓谤？”写出长达六、七千字的“红楼梦底风格”，“怨而不怒”的风格说即是从中“脱胎换骨而来”。我们不能不“钦佩”俞平伯是怎样善于接受和丰富这些最坏的传统。这和他敢从点滴的事实考证中，得出巨大结论的方法是有密切联系的。从这方面讲，俞平伯并不是精密的考证专家，而是捕风捉影的像耍魔术一样的演绎家。
    在这里，我们不能不对文怀沙在“红楼梦研究”“跋”中的庸俗的互相标榜的话头提出“微词”。在俞平伯全部关于红楼梦的著作中，我们不但没有看到他对于“中国文学的历史遗产”所抱的“严肃的态度”，以及他的“史癖趋向于红楼梦的程度简直不下于乾嘉诸子对于典籍的诠诂”的态度，而是实实在在不折不扣的主观的杜撰和附会。文怀沙也许为此会说我们也是“过事偏激”者，但我们却想进一步了解他所称赞的俞先生的“这一层用意”，揭发他主观唯心论的考证方法。
    把文学作品的红楼梦当作考据对象，把完整的艺术形象凌迟成个别的生活现象，局限于表面的观察和收集分散的事实，而不从全体去把握它，这正是俞平伯主观主义形而上学的考证方法的特色。列宁曾经说过：“事实如果不是从整体中、不是从联系中去把握的，如果是片断的和随便取来的，那就仅仅是玩具而已，或者是什么更坏些的东西”，其结果，就必然走向神秘主义。俞平伯研究红楼梦三十年来的结果就证明了这一点。他向人们宣布现实主义红楼梦在“中国文坛上是个梦魇”，“你越研究便愈觉糊涂”，“凡夫俗子”们，对它只能“望洋兴叹”而已。这就是被文怀沙所赞扬的“对中国文学的历史遗产抱着严肃态度”的“唯物史观者”所得到的唯一结论——神秘主义“不可知”的结论。这就是俞平伯考证方法的“杰出成就”，也是“大胆的假设，小心的求证”的实验主义的认识论与方法论不可避免的结局。
    这种结局是不是偶然的呢？是不是像有些人说的他的考证方法与观点无关系的呢？不是的。俞平伯对红楼梦的评价时而说是“雪芹自传”，时而说是“色空观念”，处处自相矛盾，愈说愈不能圆满。因为唯心论者总是从片面局部去看问题，看不到整体间的相互联系，因而就不可能正确地理解一件事物。俞平伯的错误证明了唯心论根本不能解决任何问题。
    在这里，我们不难回答，“新红学派”、尤其是俞平伯对红楼梦的研究究竟作了些什么呢？我们认为，他们利用了红楼梦不是一人所写成的空子，利用了红楼梦中消极落后的一面，用“实验主义”的烦琐的考证方法来代替文学批评，歪曲和否定红楼梦的现实主义成就，宣传反动的唯心论的观点、方法，把读者引到俞平伯所制造的“太虚幻境”中去。直接地抵制了马克思列宁主义在古典文学研究领域中的传播和运用。他们的全部罪过就在这里。这是伟大的古典作家曹雪芹的不幸，是伟大的古典杰作红楼梦的不幸，是祖国优秀的古典文学遗产的不幸，是广大读者的不幸。因此新红学派的些微成绩是不能与它的过失相抵消的。清算“新红学家”、尤其是俞平伯的反动观点，就是保护祖国的文学遗产。如果把这样一个严肃的思想斗争与他个别的点滴的成绩混淆起来是完全错误的。
  〔注〕在我们的“评‘红楼梦研究’”一文中，曾经对俞平伯关于红楼梦后四十回的研究，部分地作了错误的评价，在肯定他微小的成绩时，并没有发现他否定后四十回的目的，对于这种烦琐的考证方法，失掉了敏锐的感觉，这种错误是原则性的，我们已另外写了文章（见人民大学校刊“教学与研究”一九五四年第十一号）加以纠正。——笔者
