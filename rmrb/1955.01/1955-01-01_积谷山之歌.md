    Song of Jigu Mountain
    By Jin Feng, Our Reporter
    I've been on Jigu Mountain for several days now. One day at noon, I walked along the main road on the mountainside towards the first platoon's position. To call it a main road is an exaggeration, it's barely wide enough for two people to walk side by side. But compared to the steep path up the mountain, this can be considered Jigu Mountain's main thoroughfare.

    The weather was fine, the sea was calm, and the sun shone brilliantly. The undulating ocean was the color of jade. Hundreds of white sails billowed on the sea, and the fishing boats had already set out.

    It was Sunday, and the mountain seemed particularly lively. On the small training grounds carved out of the steep coast, each less than ten feet square, people were doing parallel bars and horizontal bars. From a distance, it looked like they were flipping and turning on the sea. Here and there, songs and the sound of the huqin could be heard. The only yellow dog on the mountain was also excited, darting around and barking. Several white rabbits opened their round, red eyes and hopped around in the grass. Only the fat pigs, as usual, lazily dozed in the sun.

    The first platoon was stationed on the main position facing Dachen Island. Xiang Yun, the small-sized machine gunner on sentry duty, was on watch, the machine gun also on aerial alert. Inside the house, however, there was a burst of laughter. It turned out that everyone was watching the youngest Wang Puwang practice the lion dance. Only Jin Jiaxing was lying on the bed, writing something. As soon as I walked over to look, he immediately stood up, his face seeming to flush, and hurriedly closed his notebook. "Studying hard?" I asked with a smile. "No, our Jin Jiaxing writes every day, preparing to become a writer," the mischievous Wang Puwang said with a grin, stopping his dance. The other soldiers looked at Jin Jiaxing and laughed happily. Jin Jiaxing's face turned even redder, and he said softly, "You're really good at making things up. I'm just writing a diary, aren't you all writing them too?" The platoon leader came out to defuse the situation: "He really is writing a diary, the cultural instructor asked us all to write them." "Can I take a look?" "Of course." The platoon leader immediately collected six or seven diaries and handed them to me. I remembered what a unit leader had said to me: "Now, our soldiers are very different from before. Most of them can read and write, not only can they defend the country and build the country, but they can also sing about the country and sing about their own lives."

    An hour later, dozens of diaries were piled up in front of me. Some were hardcover and beautifully bound, ready-made "Construction Diaries" and "Happiness Diaries" bought from stationery stores, some were exercise books used by students for compositions, and some were bound by themselves with white paper. Some were written very neatly and fluently, exactly like a diligent and excellent middle school student; others had stiff handwriting, but every stroke was careful and clear. Whether fluent or stiff, I knew that these dozens of books filled with dense words were all handwritten by the soldiers. These were hands that held guns, hands that held pickaxes, and some, not long ago, were hands that held hoes. The soldiers vividly and simply depicted their small island life, and also depicted their own rich and colorful spiritual world.

    Before me unfolded a picture of Jigu Mountain since its liberation a year ago: a desolate island, a mountain standing in the middle of the sea, piles of big-headed flies, waist-high weeds, open trenches, construction carried out under artillery fire, sparks flying from pickaxes, stones crushing shoulders, sweat, rain and mud dripping from head to toe; logs of wood, green bricks, carried step by step up the mountain; gun muzzles pointing east, barracks facing the sun, training grounds carved out of the rocks, tin houses as classrooms, songs floating on the wind to the ocean...

    In the diary of soldier Geng Julin, he wrote the following poem to summarize their island life over the past year:

    "The sea roars, the waves are a foot high, heroic soldiers guard the desolate island, day and night monitoring the vast ocean, not letting the enemy look at our border.

    "The sea roars, the waves are a foot high, pickaxes and shovels clang, sweat soaks the soldiers' clothes, bean-sized blisters cover their hands. The heroic soldiers don't care about these, they must turn the island into an iron wall.

    "The sea roars, the waves are a foot high, the soldiers guarding the island are in high spirits, basketball and volleyball are played intensely, and loud songs fly over the ocean, all the way to Tiananmen Square. Let the beloved Chairman Mao know that his soldiers will turn the desolate island into a lovely home."

    What a proud soldier's heart is jumping in this poem! Although they are far from the mainland, their eyes are always on the motherland, on the people. Everything they see in their daily life on the island nourishes their love for the motherland and their love for the people. When a merchant ship sailed across the ocean, Geng Julin described it so vividly and meticulously:

    "In the morning, I carried a bucket to the kitchen to fetch food. I had just put down the carrying pole when I heard the sound of a motor, but I didn't know where it was coming from. But the closer I listened, the closer it seemed. After a while, I could see three merchant ships and one escort ship with my own eyes, protecting them safely traveling from the southwest direction, passing by this island. In a blink of an eye, my eyes widened even more. The machines were running especially fast, and the smoke spewing from the chimneys flew in the sky like a flock of birds, which was extremely beautiful. At that time, I was very happy and joyful, and my heart was boiling like a pot of boiling water. These are our own merchant ships busy day and night building socialism!"

    When fishermen went out to fish, Geng Julin was happy and worried with them. When the sea was calm, he wrote:

    "This day is cloudless, the warm sun shines on me, the ocean is very calm, and the clear sea water is singing. Countless fishermen of the motherland are safely casting their nets and fishing there, it's really happiness!"

    When the wind picked up, Geng Julin became anxious:

    "At six o'clock in the afternoon, suddenly, a strong sea wind blew, turning the sky dark and the earth dim, and the ocean turned into a yellow field, with waves several feet high. There are still fishing boats that haven't returned! They are roaming around on the sea, alas, they are suffering. The masts and sails are shaking under the wind, how can they fish in such a strong wind? Go back quickly! I was constantly worried in my heart. After eating dinner, I went out to take a look again. They went home one after another, and at this time, a stone fell from my heart."

    In a diary entry by Ling Lida, the soldiers' feelings for Jigu Mountain and the motherland were even more concentratedly expressed. Ling Lida is an old soldier I know, and also a party group leader of the ninth squad. He is usually quiet and always works hard. When asked to talk about his work, he always smiles and says, "Nothing." In his diary, I saw more clearly that his thoughts and feelings were completely devoted to the Party, to the motherland, and to the people. Here is a short poem he wrote on December 3rd of last year:

    "I guard Jigu Mountain, watching the boundless ocean. To the northeast is Dachen Island, where man-eating beasts are entrenched, jackals that betray the motherland. The people there are hungry and cold, looking forward to liberation every day! When I look to the west, I see the motherland, the people on the mainland, the factories, and the vast land, the beautiful rivers and mountains. I think of my father actively producing there, and my younger siblings attending school. The village government sent a letter the day before yesterday, stating that tractors will be driven to my hometown next year.

    "Motherland, lovely motherland, how strong you are, your strength is endless, and the people of the whole country are so happy in your embrace!

    "I guard this high mountain, and the purpose is to make the motherland more rapidly prosperous and strong. Not to let the enemy invade an inch of the great motherland, let it simply die in the great ocean of the motherland!"

    积谷山之歌
    本报记者　金凤
    我来积谷山已经好几天了。一天中午，我沿着山腰的大道往第一班阵地走去。说是大道，也不过至多并排走两个人。但是比起上山那条笔陡的路来，这就要算积谷山的大马路了。
    天气很好，海上风平浪静，太阳灿烂地照耀着。微波起伏的海洋，呈现着碧玉似的颜色。几百张白帆在海上扬起，渔船早已出海了。
    这一天是星期日，山上显得分外活跃。沿着陡峭的海岸挖出来的一小块一小块不到一丈见方的小操场上，都有人在翻双杠、练单杠。远远看去，人就像在大海上翻来翻去似的。这里、那里，都传出歌声和胡琴声。山上唯一的一条黄狗也高兴起来，在人前人后乱窜乱叫。几只小白兔睁起滚圆的红眼睛，在青草中蹦蹦跳跳。只有那几口肥猪，还是像平常一样懒洋洋地在太阳下打盹。
    一班在面对大陈的主阵地上，岗哨上那小个子的机枪手相云在值班，机枪口也对空警戒着。屋内却一片笑声，原来大家都在看最年轻的王普旺练习跳狮子舞。只有金家兴伏在床上在写着什么。我刚走过去看，他马上站起来，似乎脸也红了，赶忙把本子合上。“在用功吗？”我笑着问。“不，我们的金家兴天天写，天天写，准备当作家哩。”调皮的王普旺舞也不跳了，在一旁笑嘻嘻地说。其他战士望着金家兴都愉快地笑起来。金家兴的脸更红了，小声说：“你们真会编派，我写日记罢了，你们还不都写吗？”一班长这时候出来解围了：“真是写日记，文化教员让我们大家都写的。”“可以看看吗？”“自然可以。”班长马上收集了六七本日记交给我。我这时记起一位部队首长对我说的话：“现在，我们的战士已经和以前大不相同了。他们大多数能看能写，不仅仅能保卫祖国，建设祖国，也能歌唱祖国，歌唱他们自己的生活了。”
    一小时后，我的面前已经堆了几十本日记。有的是硬面精装，从文具店里买来的现成的“建设日记”、“幸福日记”，有的就是学生们作文用的练习本，也有的是他们自己用一些白纸装订起来的。有的写得很工整、很流利，完全像是一个勤勉的优秀的中学生写的；有的笔迹还生硬，但是一笔一划都很仔细、很清楚。不管是流利，是生硬，我知道，这几十本密密麻麻的字，全是战士们的手写的，这是一些拿枪的手，拿铁镐的手，有些不久以前还是拿锄头的手。战士们朴素、生动地描绘了他们的小小海岛的生活，也描绘了他们自己丰富多采的精神世界。
    在我面前展开了积谷山解放一年来的图画：荒凉的海岛，矗立在大海中央的山岗，一堆堆的大头苍蝇，一人高的荒草，露天的壕沟，在炮火下进行的修建，铁镐迸出火星，石头压烂肩膀，汗水、雨水和泥浆水从头滴到脚下；一根根的木材，一块块的青砖，一步步背到山上；炮口指向东方，营房向着太阳，山石中开出操场，铁皮房子当课堂，歌声随风飘到海洋上……
    在战士耿橘林的日记上，他写了这样的一首诗歌来总结他们这一年来的海岛生活：
    “海水哗哗的响，浪头高有一丈，英雄战士守卫在荒岛上，日夜监视着辽阔的海洋，不让敌人向我们的边疆望一望。
    “海水哗哗的响，浪头高有一丈，铁镐铁锹响叮当，汗水湿透了战士们的衣裳，豆大的血泡打满了手掌。英雄的战士不管这些，一定要把海岛变成铁壁铜墙。
    “海水哗哗地响，浪头高有一丈，守岛的战士情绪高涨，篮球排球打得紧张，响亮的歌声飞过海洋，一直传到天安门上。让敬爱的毛主席知道，是他的战士要把荒岛变成可爱的家乡。”
    在这诗里跳跃着的是一颗怎样自豪的战士的心啊！他们虽然远离祖国大陆，但是他们的眼睛时时向着祖国，向着人民。他们在海岛上日常生活中所看到的一切，都哺育着他们热爱祖国、热爱人民的心。有的商船航过海洋，耿橘林看到，就这样生动细致地描写了：
    “早晨我挑着水桶去伙房打饭，到那里刚刚放下扁担，忽听得马达声响，就是不知道在什么地方。可是愈听愈近，不一会，从眼目中就可以看到三只商船，一只护航舰，保护它们安全的行驶，从西南方向顺本岛通过。一转身的功夫，我的眼睛就睁得更大了。机器开得特别快，从烟囱里吐出来的烟像一群飞鸟似的在天空飞翔，可好看极了。当时我非常高兴和愉快，心里像一锅开水似的沸腾起来了，这是我们自己的商船在日夜奔忙着建设社会主义哪！”
    渔民出海捕鱼了，耿橘林和他们一起高兴，一起担心。在风平浪静的时候，他这样写：
      “这一天万里无云，温暖的太阳照着我，海洋里平静得很，清清的海水正在歌唱。祖国无数的渔民在那里安全的撒网打鱼，真是幸福啊！”
    风起来了，耿橘林着忙起来了：
    “过午六点钟，突然，猛烈的海风刮得天昏地暗，海洋变成一片黄野，海水浪头有几丈高。还有渔船没有回去！在海上游来游去，唉，他们可是受罪啦。桅杆和篷叫风吹得直摇晃，这大的风还怎能打鱼呢？赶快回去吧！我心中不住的担心。到吃过晚饭以后又出去看了看，他们一个跟着一个回家走了，这时候我心里一块石头才落了地。”
    在凌利达的一篇日记中更集中表达了战士们对积谷山、对祖国的感情。凌利达是我认识的一个老战士，也是九班的一个党的小组长。他平时不声不响，工作起来一贯埋头苦干。要他谈谈他的工作，他总是笑笑说：“没有什么。”在他的日记上我才更清楚地看到了他的思想感情完全倾注于党，倾注于祖国和人民。这里是他在去年十二月三日写的一首短诗：
      “我守卫在积谷山上，眼看着无边的海洋。东北方向就是大陈，那里盘踞着吃人的野兽，出卖祖国的豺狼。那里的老百姓饥寒交迫，天天盼望着解放！我向西一看，就看到祖国，那大陆上的人民、工厂和那广阔的土地，美丽的河山。我想起了父亲正在那里积极生产，弟弟妹妹上了学堂。前天村政府来一封信，说明年拖拉机就要开到我的家乡。
    “祖国，可爱的祖国，你是多么强壮，你的力量是无穷无尽，全国人民在你的怀抱里是多幸福！
      “我守住这高高的山岗，目的是为了祖国更加迅速繁荣富强。不让敌人侵犯伟大祖国寸土，叫它干脆死在祖国的大海洋！”
