Over the past year, the armed forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in East China, in coordination with the local militia and with the enthusiastic support of the people of the whole country, have heroically shattered the Chiang bandit troops' repeated conspiracies of harassment, captured and annihilated a large number of Chiang bandit agents who infiltrated the mainland, and crossed the sea to liberate several islands occupied by the Chiang bandit troops. At the same time, they also conducted escort and fishing protection, ensuring the safe navigation of merchant ships at sea and fisheries production. Since August, when the motherland issued the solemn call to liberate Taiwan, the army, navy, and air force stationed in East China have worked more closely together to actively strike at the Chiang bandit troops entrenched on the coastal islands, especially striking hard at the Chiang bandit's air force and navy, and constantly achieving victories in annihilating the Chiang bandit's effective strength, initially demonstrating the powerful force of our army in modern joint operations.

Four Chiang bandit military command organs were destroyed. Three islands, including Toumenshan Island, Tian'ao Island, and Jiang'er'ao Island, off the coast of Zhejiang were liberated by crossing the sea. 376 Chiang bandit troops were killed or wounded, 2,646 were captured, and 123 surrendered, totaling 3,145. 21 various boats, 421 various guns, more than 26,000 rounds of various bullets, 14 radio stations, and other military supplies were seized.
