(Xinhua News Agency, Rome, January 16th) According to TASS, "l'Unità" published the "Letter to the Italian People" passed by the closing session of the Fourth National Congress of the Italian Communist Party.

The letter to the people first pointed out that the policies stubbornly pursued by the leaders of Western countries, plotting atomic war and deepening the division of Europe, have aroused deep indignation from the world's public. This indignation is so strong that it has even caused panic among certain leadership groups of Atlantic countries. However, the Scelba-Saragat government remains deaf to the people's anger and indignation. The Scelba-Saragat government intends to blindly embark on a path that leads the country to disaster.

The letter to the people said that the Italian communists call on all honest people to unite more closely, strive for a fundamental change in our country's foreign policy direction, strive to make our country a factor in the unity of the people of Europe, and strive to make the Italian Senate reject new military pacts.

The letter to the people said that in order for Italy to implement a peaceful policy, it is necessary to repel the current rulers' attacks on constitutional freedoms, to stop measures that divide the people, to stop measures that discriminate against citizens before the law, to stop replacing the law with tyranny, to stop abolishing urban local self-government institutions and the autonomous governments of provinces, and to stop persecuting cooperatives, people's organizations, and newspapers that criticize and express opposition to the government.

The letter to the people said that the current task facing the Italian people is a new and great democratic battle: a common struggle for peace, freedom, and social progress. This struggle can be victorious because the Italian democratic movement has achieved great victories since uniting around the Communist Party and the Socialist Party. Millions of men and women have already united under the banner of reviving Italy. It is these united forces that once made a decisive contribution to the cause of overthrowing fascist tyranny.

The letter to the people said that now, all those who want to save the freedom and peace of our motherland are united around the principles and program of the Republican Constitution, despite their different ideals and political positions. The people must use indignant conscience and struggle to stop the warmongers, block the path of the clerical-fascist alliance, and promote the establishment of a government that advocates peace, freedom, and social progress.

    意共第四次全国代表会议通过告意大利人民书
    号召人民团结起来拒绝新的军事公约
   【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社罗马十六日讯：“团结报”刊载了意大利共产党第四次全国代表会议闭幕会议所通过的“告意大利人民书”。
    告人民书首先指出，西方国家的领导人所顽固地执行的策划原子战争、加深欧洲分裂的政策，引起了全世界公众的深切愤慨。这种愤慨异常强烈，甚至使某些大西洋国家的领导集团张慌失措。但是，谢尔巴—萨拉盖特政府对人民的震怒和愤慨仍然不闻不问。谢尔巴—萨拉盖特政府打算盲目地走上把国家导向灾难的道路。
    告人民书说，意大利共产党人号召所有正直的人们更加紧密地团结起来，争取从根本上改变我国外交政策方针，争取使我国成为欧洲各国人民团结的一个因素，争取使意大利参议院拒绝新的军事公约。
    告人民书说，要使意大利能够执行和平政策，就必须击退目前的统治者对宪法自由的进攻，制止分裂人民的措施，制止在法律面前歧视公民的措施，制止用专横来代替法律，制止取消城市地方自治机构和省的自治政府，制止迫害合作社、人民组织和提出批评表示反对政府的报纸的措施。
    告人民书说，意大利人当前面临的任务是一场新的、伟大的民主战斗：争取和平、自由和社会进步的共同斗争。这场斗争是能够胜利的，因为意大利民主运动自从团结在共产党和社会党的周围后已获得了巨大的胜利。千百万男女已经在复兴意大利的旗帜下团结起来了。正是这些团结起来的力量曾经对推翻法西斯暴政的事业作出了决定性的贡献。
    告人民书说，现在，凡是想要拯救我们祖国的自由和和平的人，都团结在共和国宪法原则和纲领的周围，尽管他们抱着不同的理想和政治立场。人民一定可以用激愤的良心和斗争来制止战争贩子，堵塞教权派—法西斯联盟的道路，促进建立一个主张和平、自由和社会进步的政府。
