    Shaoshan Township Establishes Thirteen Agricultural Production Cooperatives
    Last spring, Shaoshan Township in Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, the hometown of Chairman Mao, established its first agricultural production cooperative - the Shaoshan Agricultural Production Cooperative. This cooperative achieved a bumper harvest last year, with the average grain yield per mu increasing by 5% compared to 1953, exceeding the output of general mutual aid teams in the township by 12%, and exceeding that of individual farmers by 21%. After the autumn harvest distribution, the farmers in the township personally witnessed the superiority displayed by the agricultural production cooperative and asked to organize cooperatives one after another. At present, thirteen agricultural production cooperatives have been established in Shaoshan Township, with participating farm households reaching 62% of the total farm households in the township.

    韶山乡建立十三个农业生产合作社
    去年春天，毛主席的故乡湖南省湘潭县韶山乡，建立了第一个农业生产合作社——韶山农业生产合作社。这个社去年便获得丰收，全社平均每亩粮食的产量比一九五三年增加了百分之五，超过乡内一般互助组的产量百分之十二，超过单干农民百分之二十一。秋收分配后，乡内农民亲眼看到了农业生产合作社所显示的优越性，纷纷要求组织合作社。目前韶山乡已建立了十三个农业生产合作社，参加农户达到全乡总农户百分之六十二。
