    Clearing Grain Purchase Overdues
    Kang Zhong
    Last year, as the unified grain purchase work was nearing its end, some areas hastily concluded this work. What should have been continued was not continued, and some outstanding issues that should have been resolved were not well resolved. Many farmers expressed dissatisfaction, criticizing this phenomenon as "tight at first, then loose, then giving up altogether."
    This year's unified grain purchase work has once again entered the stage of delivering grain to warehouses. Many farmers have sold their surplus grain according to the amount they reported for sale, but some farmers have only sold a portion and still have some overdues. Taking Henan Province as an example, in some areas, households with grain purchase overdues account for about 15 percent of the total number of households involved in unified purchase. In some townships in the Zhangqiu Special District of Shandong Province, households with overdues account for about 40 percent of the total number of households involved in unified purchase. In Linxiang County, Hunan Province, fifty-one townships have overdues.
    There are two types of overdues. One is due to the fact that some areas did not accurately assess local output and consumption, and the assigned tasks were inappropriate, making it difficult for farmers to deliver grain. Although there are many households with this type of overdue, the amount of grain owed is not large, and some areas have already adjusted and resolved this based on the principle of seeking truth from facts. The other type is where landlords and rich peasants resist delivery, and some wealthy middle peasants take the opportunity to delay. They are few in number, but the amount of overdues is large. For example, in Huilongpu Township, Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, the grain owed by this type of overdue household accounts for 70 percent of the total amount of overdues in the township.
    The phenomenon of surplus grain households delaying or refusing to deliver grain shows that the ideological struggle becomes more acute and complex as the unified grain purchase movement enters the storage stage. Everyone wants to sell less and keep more, hesitating and waiting to see what happens. Therefore, at this time, it is even more necessary to intensify education and do a good job in the unified purchase work. However, some district and township cadres at this time are satisfied with the fact that "farmers have already reported the amount of grain they will sell," believing that "there is no problem in completing the grain purchase task," and have developed a paralyzing thought of "taking a breather."
    Properly handling the issue of overdues is an urgent task in current rural work. If this work is done well, it will stimulate farmers' enthusiasm for production, and mutual assistance and unity among farmers, and will be conducive to the development of unified purchase and sales work in the future. If this work is not done well, not only will the state fail to complete the unified purchase task, but it will also cause dissatisfaction among those households that have delivered the full amount. In order to properly resolve the issue of overdues, some areas have organized symposiums of activists, inviting overdue households to participate, and using reasoning and accounting methods to conduct another round of mobilization. They also use various relationships and forms to conduct individual coordination, cultivating activists from among them, and using the activists to motivate overdue households to sell grain. At the same time, they conduct legal education for landlords and rich peasants who attempt to resist delivery and hoard for speculation, and send individual violators to the court for handling. For those farmers who truly have difficulty in delivering grain, a reduction or exemption from purchase should be granted based on the principle of seeking truth from facts, according to their actual surplus grain situation, in order to achieve fairness and reasonableness. These methods can be emulated in various localities. In short, we should not repeat the mistakes of last year, but should persist in doing a good job in the unified purchase work to the end.

    清理购粮尾欠
    康中
    去年，粮食统购工作快到结尾的时候，有一些地区草草地就结束了这项工作。应该继续收购的不收购了，应该解决的一些遗留问题也没有很好解决。很多农民表示了不满，指责这种现象是“一紧、二松、三不要”。
    今年度的粮食统购工作又进入了送粮入仓的阶段，很多农民已按照自己报售的数量出卖了余粮，但是也有一些农民只出售了一部分，还留下了一部分尾欠。拿河南省来说，有些地区，售粮尾欠户约占统购户数的百分之十五左右；山东省章邱专区有的乡，有尾欠的农户占统购户的百分之四十左右；湖南省临湘县有五十一个乡有尾欠。
    尾欠有两种情况。一种是由于有些地区没有摸清当地产量和消耗量，分配任务不当，农民交售确有困难。这种尾欠户户数虽然较多，但所欠粮食数量不大，有的地区已经本着实事求是的原则加以调整解决。另一种则是地主、富农抗拒交售，和一些富裕中农乘机拖延。他们的户数不多，但尾欠数量很大。如湖南省宁乡县回龙铺乡，这种尾欠户欠售的粮食，即占全乡尾欠数量的百分之七十。
    余粮户拖欠不交售粮食的现象，说明了越是当粮食统购运动进入入库阶段时，他们的思想斗争就越是尖锐和复杂。都想少卖一点，多留一点，犹豫观望。因此，这个时候就更需要加紧教育工作，就更需要作好统购工作。可是某些区、乡干部在这个时候却满足于“农民已经报出了售粮数量”，认为“完成购粮任务无问题”，产生了“松一口气”的麻痹思想。
    妥善地处理尾欠问题，是当前农村工作一项迫切任务。这项工作做好了，就能刺激农民生产积极性，和农民之间的互助团结，并有利于今后统购统销工作的开展；如果这项工作没有做好，不仅国家完不成统购任务，而且也会引起那些全额交售户的不满。为了妥善地解决尾欠问题，有的地区组织了积极分子座谈会，叫尾欠户参加，用说理算账的办法，进行再一次的动员，并通过各种关系和各种形式进行个别串通，从中培养积极分子，通过积极分子带动尾欠户售粮；同时对那些企图抗拒交售、囤积投机的地主和富农，进行守法教育，对个别违法破坏者送法院处理。对那些交售确有困难的农户，则应本实事求是的原则，根据他们的实际余粮情况，予以减购或免购，以达到公平合理。这些方法，各地都可以仿行。总之，不应该重蹈去年的复辙，而要坚持到底做好统购工作。
