    In Korçë
    —Random Notes from Albania
    Cui Qi
    The road from Tirana to Korçë is almost entirely mountainous. The road winds around the mountains, and the mountains wind around the road. In these high mountains and dense forests, the Albanian guerrillas wrote countless heroic deeds, giving the German and Italian invaders of the time a fatal blow. Along the highway, we saw some guerrilla monuments. On the hillsides, farmers used white stones to arrange huge slogans: "Long Live the Tenth Anniversary of Liberation!"
    Our car climbed to the top of a high mountain. From here, looking west, you can see the blue Adriatic Sea; looking east, you can see the mountains of Yugoslavia. On this side of the mountains is the Korçë region.
    Korçë has a population of 100,000 and is the country's main agricultural area. It is also one of the birthplaces of the Albanian Communist Party and has a glorious revolutionary tradition. Since liberation, Korçë's work in all aspects has been advanced, and it recently won the Red Flag for overall excellence in the ten-year competition.
    Before the war, sixty landlords in the Korçë region occupied 49 percent of the land. The peasants worked hard but could not get enough to eat. The people's government implemented land reform, and each peasant household received three to three and a half hectares of land. In 1947, five agricultural cooperatives were established. Now there are fifty-two, accounting for one-third of the total number of agricultural cooperatives in the country.
    Our car drove down from the mountains covered with oak trees and "Kochimale" flowers. The Albanian driver comrade pointed to a large plain ahead and said:
      "Malik!"
    This place is called Malik. Neat fields, brand-new houses, smoking factories—there is nothing particularly attractive about the scenery. But how would you imagine that not long ago this was a large lake! I can still find the blue Lake Malik on a Chinese map that I carry with me. This map is already outdated for today's Albania.
    Lake Malik is the "Dragon Beard Ditch" of the Korçë region. It was originally a stagnant water and swamp area, the source of malaria mosquitoes and plagues, and a disaster for nearby residents. The people's government was determined to completely drain the lake and turn it into tens of thousands of hectares of fertile land. On this former lakebed, the country's largest agricultural cooperative was established. It has 300 peasant households and 4,000 hectares of land. Next to it appeared a sugar factory, a glass factory, a furniture factory, and a new type of small city—Malik. There is a cultural center, a cinema, a hospital, a school, and a sports field. Young Malik is growing.
    The cultivated land area of the Korçë region has greatly increased. In 1944, it was 230,000 hectares, and now it is 375,000 hectares. On these fields, there are crisscrossing drainage and irrigation canals, seed selection stations and nurseries, and livestock breeding stations and tractor stations. The peasants no longer wait for the capricious "gifts" of nature, but are transforming nature with their labor and wisdom. They are improving the soil, cultivating new grain varieties, adopting cluster sowing methods, using chemical fertilizers, and driving tractors and combine harvesters.
    In the past, the Korçë region often suffered from floods, which washed away houses, fields, roads, and bridges. Now, the peasants can control those turbulent rivers and have built twenty power stations in more than a dozen villages.
    Next to a mountain stream in the village of Dashnitsa, we saw a stone house. Its exterior is old and ordinary, but its interior radiates the light of a new life. Two farmers were managing a small power station. They told us that, apart from the generator, all the other equipment was collected by the farmers themselves and made of wood. They spontaneously used hydropower to solve the electricity problem for the entire village, and now the whole village has electric lights.
    In today's long winter nights, the peasants no longer huddle around a dim oil lamp, mending ragged clothes, and worrying about a vague tomorrow. They look forward to a better tomorrow with optimism and confidence.
    When we visited the village of Bugarec, the chairman of the agricultural cooperative, Kinai Risa, told us endlessly about their past, present, and future. In the past, they did not even have enough walking plows. Now, 70 percent of the land is cultivated by tractors. In 1949, each hectare produced 800 kilograms of wheat, and now it is 2,030 kilograms. In the past, the reward for one workday was three and a half kilograms of grain, and now it is seven kilograms of grain, plus ten leks (Albanian currency).
    Before liberation, the words "farmer" and "granary" could never be linked together. Today, the peasants of the Bugarec agricultural cooperative already have two large warehouses and many granaries that can store 4,000 quintals of grain. They are preparing for an even bigger harvest. Many farmers have also converted their houses into granaries because they have now moved into new houses.
    In recent years, the village of Bugarec, with 142 peasant households, has built 45 new houses. Kinai Risa led us to visit the family of the peasant Gachilisa. This family of thirteen lives in a brand-new two-story building. In the living room, there are electric lights, carpets, tables, chairs, and beautiful curtains. In the bedroom, there is a gramophone, a clock, and a stack of the Labor Party's newspaper, "People's Voice." Gachilisa treated the guests with sugar and wine. He told us that the current life was something he could not have dreamed of in the past.
    Creative labor is changing the lives of peasants and also changing their spiritual outlook.
    Kinai Risa told us a story: "In the past, there were two groups of people in our village, one group believed in Islam, and the other group believed in Orthodox Christianity. They never interacted with each other, and their relationship was very bad. But since the establishment of the cooperative, the situation has changed. Now we are all very harmonious..."
    Speaking here, he paused, glanced at his companions, and added: "And, there are twelve couples getting married."
    Everyone laughed.
    This is indeed a gratifying thing.
    Albanian comrades told us that among the residents of the mountainous areas before liberation, there was a custom created by the old society called "Hakmarrje," which means "blood feud." Two families often became sworn enemies because of some matter, like the two families of Romeo and Juliet. The reactionary government in the past tried its best to incite "Hakmarrje" because they were afraid of the unity of the people. However, since liberation, "Hakmarrje" has disappeared. Things that could not be resolved for generations have been easily resolved under the new social system. In today's Korçë and Albania, the tragedy of Romeo and Juliet will never happen.
    On the way back, the Albanian driver comrade picked a branch of "Kochimale" flowers for me from the hillside. Each of its stems has lush green leaves, white flowers, and dark red fruits. I think this is precisely a symbol that the entire Korçë and Albania, like the "Kochimale" flower, is growing comprehensively and vigorously. (Attached picture)

    在科尔察
    ——阿尔巴尼亚散记
    崔奇
    从地拉那到科尔察的路上，几乎全是山区。路盘着山，山又盘着路。在这些山高林又密的地方，阿尔巴尼亚游击队曾经写下无数可歌可泣的事迹，他们给当时的德、意侵略者以致命打击。在公路旁，看到一些游击队的纪念碑。在山坡上，农民们用白石子摆着巨大的标语：“解放十周年万岁！”
    我们的汽车爬上了一座高山之巅。从这里向西望，可以看见蓝色的亚得里亚海；向东望，可以看到南斯拉夫的群山。在群山的这边就是科尔察州。
    科尔察有十万人口，是全国的主要农产区。它又是阿尔巴尼亚共产党的发祥地之一，有着光荣的革命传统。解放以来，科尔察的各方面工作都是先进的，不久以前曾荣获十年竞赛全面优胜红旗。
    战前，科尔察州的六十户地主霸占了百分之四十九的土地。农民胼手胝足，不得温饱。人民政权实行了土地改革，每户农民得到三公顷到三公顷半的土地。一九四七年，建立了五个农业合作社。现在已经有五十二个，占全国农业合作社总数的三分之一。
    我们的车子从那些盛长着柞树和“科奇马莱”花的山岭上开下来。阿尔巴尼亚司机同志指着前边的一大片平原说：
      “马利克！”
    这个地方叫马利克。整齐的田陇，崭新的房舍，冒烟的工厂。——没有什么特别吸引人的景物。但是，你怎么会想到，不久以前这里是一个大湖！我在随身带着的一本中文地图上，还可以找到那个蓝色的马利克湖。这本地图对今天的阿尔巴尼亚来说，已经是陈旧了。
    马利克湖就是科尔察州的“龙须沟”。它原来是一片死水和沼泽地带，是疟蚊和瘟疫的发源地，是附近居民的灾难。人民政权下了决心，把湖水彻底抽干了，并把它变成上万公顷的良田。就在这个昔日的湖底上，成立了一个全国最大的农业合作社。它拥有三百户农民，四千公顷土地。旁边出现了制糖厂、玻璃厂、家具厂和一个新型的小城市——马利克。这里有文化馆、电影院、医院、学校和运动场。年轻的马利克正在成长。
    科尔察州的耕地面积大大增加了。一九四四年是二十三万公顷，现在是三十七万五千公顷。在这些田地上，出现了纵横交错的排水渠和灌溉渠，出现了选种站和苗圃，出现了牲畜饲养站和拖拉机站。农民们不再等待反复无常的大自然的“恩赐”，而是在以他们的劳动和智慧来改造大自然了。他们在改良土壤，培养新的谷物品种，采用簇形播种法，使用化学肥料，驾驶拖拉机和联合收割机。
    从前，科尔察州经常闹水灾，大水来的时候把房屋、田地、道路和桥梁都冲坏了。现在农民们已经可以驾驭那些湍急的河流，并在十几个村落里建立了二十个发电站。
    在达什尼察村的一条山溪的旁边，我们看见一所石屋。它的外表是陈旧的，平凡的，但是它的里边却发射着新生活的光芒。两个农民正在管理着一个小发电站。他们告诉我们说，除了发电机以外，其他的一切器材都是农民自己搜集的和用木头做的。他们自发地利用水力解决了全村的电力问题，现在全村都有电灯了。
    在今日的漫长冬夜里，农民们不再围着一盏暗淡的油灯，缝补着褴褛的衣裳，为着渺茫的明天而担忧了。他们怀着乐观和自信的心情展望着更美好的明天。
    当我们去访问布加列茨村时，农业合作社主席基奈·里萨滔滔不绝地向我们讲述他们的过去、现在和将来。从前，他们连步犁也不够，现在百分之七十的土地都是用拖拉机耕种的。一九四九年每公顷产小麦八公担，现在是二十点三公担。从前一个工作日的报酬是三个半公斤的粮食，现在是七公斤粮食，还有十个里克（阿尔巴尼亚货币）。
    解放以前，“农民”和“谷仓”这两个字总是连不到一起的。今天，布加列茨农业合作社的农民们已经有了两个可以存放四千公担粮食的大仓库和许多谷仓。——他们正在准备更大的丰年呢。许多农民把自己住的房子也改为谷仓，因为他们现在已经搬进新房子住了。
    近年来，有着一百四十二户农民的布加列茨村盖了四十五所新的住宅。基奈·里萨领我们去访问了农民加奇利萨的家庭。这一家十三口人，住着一所崭新的两层楼。在客厅里，有电灯、地毯、桌椅和漂亮的窗帘。在寝室里，放着留声机、钟表和一叠劳动党机关报“人民之声”。加奇利萨用糖和酒招待客人们。他告诉我们，现在的生活是过去做梦也想不到的。
    创造性的劳动改变着农民们的生活面貌，也改变着农民们的精神面貌。
    基奈·里萨向我们讲了一个故事：“从前我们村里有两伙人，一伙人信回教，一伙人信正教，老死不相往来，关系弄得很糟。可是自从成立合作社以后，情形就变了。现在我们大家都很和睦……”
    说到这里他停顿了一下，向他的伙伴们瞅了一眼，又加上一句：“而且，有十二对结婚的。”
    大家都笑了。
    这的确是可喜的事。
    阿尔巴尼亚同志曾告诉我们，在解放以前的山区居民中，有一种旧社会所造成的风俗，叫“哈克玛尔伊”，就是“血仇”的意思。两个家族往往因为某一件事情，就像罗密欧和朱丽叶的两家族那样地誓不两立。过去的反动政府竭力煽动“哈克玛尔伊”，因为他们害怕人民的团结。但是，解放以来，“哈克玛尔伊”没有了。过去几辈子都不能解决的事情，在新社会制度下就释然而解了。在今日的科尔察和阿尔巴尼亚，是永远不会发生罗密欧和朱丽叶式的悲剧的。
    在归途中，阿尔巴尼亚的司机同志替我从山坡上摘了一枝“科奇马莱”花。它的每一个枝茎上，都长着浓绿的叶子，开着白色的花朵，结着深红的果子。我想，这恰恰是一个象征，整个科尔察和阿尔巴尼亚就像“科奇马莱”花一样全面地蓬勃地成长着。（附图片）
