    Beijing's Measures for Training Handicraft Apprentices
    Letter from the Beijing Municipal People's Government Commercial Bureau: The reader's letter from Left Jia published in your newspaper's reader's column on November 28th regarding the issue of improving the technical level of existing handicraftsmen and training a new generation of handicraftsmen is worthy of our attention. Regarding the training of a new generation of handicraftsmen, under the leadership of the United Front Work Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China in early November 1954, relevant units such as the Beijing Special Arts and Crafts Company and the Municipal Production Cooperative Union were convened to conduct continuous research and decided to first pilot the training of apprentices within the production cooperatives. Based on the current conditions of the production cooperatives and the future development needs of various types, the Municipal Special Arts and Crafts Company and the Production Cooperative Union will jointly study and formulate an apprentice training plan (including ivory carving, jade ware, cloisonné enamel, lacquer carving, etc.). Regarding the necessary expenses for training new apprentices, the Municipal Special Arts and Crafts Company will include them in the order price and processing fees according to the training quota, and the cooperatives will be responsible for specific arrangements. In addition, preliminary studies have also been carried out on improving the political treatment, living standards, and working environment of the old craftsmen, and these will be gradually improved where possible.

    北京市培养手工艺徒的办法
    北京市人民政府商业局来信：去年十一月二十八日你报读者来信专页刊载读者左嘉提出的提高现有手工艺人的技术水平和培养新一代手工艺人的问题，是值得我们重视的。关于培养新一代的手工艺人的问题，一九五四年十一月上旬在中共北京市委统战部领导下，曾连续召集了北京市特种工艺公司、市生产合作社联合总社等有关单位进行研究，决定首先在生产合作社内试行培养艺徒。根据目前生产合作社的条件结合各个类型今后的发展需要，由市特种工艺公司和生产合作社联合总社共同研究制订培养艺徒计划（包括象牙雕刻、玉器、珐琅、雕漆等）。关于培养新艺徒的必需费用，按照培养名额由市特种工艺公司在订货价和加工费中计入，由合作社负责具体安排。此外，对老艺人的政治待遇、生活待遇、工作环境的改善等，也都作了初步研究，将在可能条件下逐步改善。
