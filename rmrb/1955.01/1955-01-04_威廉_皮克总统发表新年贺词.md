Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 3rd. TASS reports: The German News Agency reports that on January 1st, Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic, received representatives from the People's Chamber, the Senate, the government, and foreign diplomatic envoys who came to offer New Year's greetings, and delivered a New Year's message.

In his message, President Pieck emphasized that, in the new year, striving for peaceful reunification of Germany and advocating peaceful coexistence among the peoples of European countries will be the guiding principles of a genuine German national policy. The primary task of the People's Chamber in the new year is to eliminate the dangers that the Paris Agreements pose to the German people, and to strive to make the peaceful reunification of Germany a democratic state.

In response to Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl's New Year's greetings on behalf of the government of the German Democratic Republic, President Pieck pointed out that the residents of the German Democratic Republic unanimously support the policies of their government. He said: The proposals of the Moscow Conference of European countries stipulate that free all-German elections should be held in 1955, and that an all-German government should be formed on this basis. However, these proposals can only be realized if peace-loving German residents prevent the ratification and implementation of the Paris Agreements. This is an indispensable condition for national unity of Germany and for guaranteeing peace in Europe. We will take steps together with all peace-loving countries attending the Moscow Conference to protect the peaceful residents of our republic from any imperialist aggression.

    威廉·皮克总统发表新年贺词
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社柏林二日讯：德意志通讯社报道，德意志民主共和国总统威廉·皮克一月一日接见了向他贺年的人民议院、参议院、政府的代表和各国外交使节，并且发表了新年贺词。
    皮克总统在贺词里着重指出：在新的一年中，争取和平统一德国和主张欧洲各国人民和平共处，将是真正的德意志民族政策的准则。人民议院在新的一年中的首要任务，是消除巴黎协定加给德国人民的危险，并且竭力使德国和平统一，成为一个民主的国家。
    皮克总统在答谢奥托·格罗提渥总理代表德意志民主共和国政府向他祝贺时，指出了德意志民主共和国居民一致支持自己政府的政策。他说：欧洲国家莫斯科会议的建议规定在一九五五年举行全德自由选举，并且在这个基础上组成全德政府。但是，只有在爱好和平的德国居民阻止批准和实施巴黎协定的情况下，才能实现这些建议。这是德国全国统一和保障欧洲和平的不可缺少的条件。我们要和所有出席莫斯科会议的爱好和平的国家共同采取步骤，来保卫我们的共和国的和平居民不受帝国主义的任何侵犯。
