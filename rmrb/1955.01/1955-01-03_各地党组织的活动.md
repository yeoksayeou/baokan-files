Activities of Party Organizations in Various Regions

    Pay Attention to Leading Grain Collection and Purchase Work
    In Heilongjiang Province, 640 district party organizations held meetings of party members and cadres or party member meetings (attended by 180,000 people) from December 1st to 5th last year to discuss grain collection and purchase work. According to incomplete statistics, grain collection and purchase work has now been launched in 4,620 villages, and by December 13th, 43.33% of the grain purchase task had been completed. By December 15th, 42.5% of the public grain had been delivered to the state treasury. This grain collection and purchase work was closely integrated with production and the agricultural cooperation movement. The Party branch and village government of Xianghong No. 7 Village in Wangkui County carefully inspected the rough and wasteful phenomena in threshing during the grain collection and purchase work, and specifically helped six agricultural production cooperatives formulate plans to increase grain production. The Xibajiazi Village branch in Hulan County investigated the problems existing in agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams during the grain collection and purchase publicity stage and made appropriate solutions. When helping farmers calculate the amount of grain to sell, they also helped farmers formulate winter production plans and plans to expand production in 1955, doing everything possible to help farmers increase grain production. This enabled Xibajiazi Village to not only quickly complete the grain purchase task but also properly organize winter production and develop mutual aid and cooperation organizations.

    Strengthen Leadership Over State-Owned Commercial Departments
    Due to the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China strengthening its leadership over the grassroots party organizations in state-owned trade enterprise departments, the work of the Taiyuan Department Store Party Branch has undergone a significant transformation. The branch pays close attention to correcting shortcomings in its work and constantly fights against unfavorable phenomena in trade work. The branch also led all staff to carefully study customers' needs for goods; it also conducted serious research on the plans and programs made by the administration each month, and put forward opinions. After the national plan was announced, the Party branch organized party members to fully implement it and regularly made summaries of the implementation work. Thanks to the leadership of party members and the efforts of all employees, since the company launched a socialist work competition in the fourth quarter of last year, it has greatly improved its business management and customer service attitude, and overfulfilled the sales plans for October and November.
    The Taiyuan Municipal Committee organized party branch secretaries from its affiliated trade enterprise units to attend some meetings of the Taiyuan Department Store Party Branch and conducted discussions in order to learn from them. (Hu Tongxin)
      Lead Herdsmen in Disaster Prevention and Livestock Protection
    The Wundubao Gacha branch of the Communist Party of China in Debolenutuk, Alukeerqin Banner, Inner Mongolia, is leading herdsmen in actively carrying out disaster prevention and livestock protection work. Wundubao Gacha is composed of five natural villages. Last year, due to heavy rainfall, the winter and spring pastures of one natural village were flooded; some pastures of two natural villages were covered with water. Therefore, the winter and spring livestock protection work in Wundubao Gacha should not only focus on doing a good job in haymaking, building pens, and sheds, but also must solve the pasture problems of three natural villages. Based on this situation, the Wundubao Gacha Party branch held a meeting of party members to discuss the issue of overcoming natural disasters and making preparations for winter and spring. It was decided to mobilize the herdsmen whose pastures were flooded to spend the winter and spring on the Caodala pasture; and to mobilize the herdsmen of the two natural villages lacking spring pastures to spend the spring on the Baiyintubude pasture. After the meeting, the branch mobilized the strength of various organizations such as the Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation, and the militia to conduct extensive publicity among the herdsmen, mobilize and organize herdsmen to move pastures. After publicity and organizational work, the herdsmen's groups of the two natural villages that were going to spend the spring on the Baiyintubude pasture had prepared all the equipment for human and animal use in early November last year; the herdsmen of the natural village that was going to spend the winter on the Caodala pasture also built pens and sheds and made preparations.

    Party Members in Taoxi Township Strengthen Unity
    Zou Huaizao, director of the Daitang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Taoxi Township, Yihuang County, Jiangxi, and Tang Sanhei, the deputy director, are both Communist Party members. However, the two of them were not convinced by each other, looked down on each other, did not discuss the work of the cooperative, and even quarreled over trivial matters, which affected the consolidation and unity of the cooperative.
    The Taoxi Township Party Branch promptly held a meeting of party members, explained the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee on strengthening party unity, and carried out criticism and self-criticism. Tang Sanhei made a painful self-criticism, saying: "The main reason why I was not united with Zou Huaizao before was because of arrogance and complacency. I thought I had a way of doing things in my work and looked down on others. If this continues to develop, it will cause losses to the cause of the Party." Zou Huaizao also made a self-criticism, saying: "I didn't discuss the affairs of the cooperative with everyone, and I decided everything myself. I didn't express my opinions about Tang Sanhei in person, and I complained behind his back, which affected the unity of the Party. In the future, I will definitely act in accordance with the spirit of the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session: do things that are conducive to the unity of the Party, and don't do things that are not conducive to the unity of the Party, promote democracy, and work with everyone to run the cooperative well." Party member Yu Yingshan also reviewed his liberal attitude of "you perform on the stage, and I watch the play off the stage" towards the phenomenon of disunity within the party.
    After this ideological examination, the party members were greatly educated, creating a good start for the branch to carry out criticism and self-criticism in the future. (Investigation and Research Group of the Organization Department of the Yihuang County Party Committee)

    各地党组织的活动
    注意领导征粮购粮工作
    黑龙江省有六百四十个区的党组织于去年十二月一日至五日先后召开了党员干部大会或党员大会（共有十八万人参加），讨论征粮和购粮工作。据不完全的统计，目前征粮和购粮工作已在四千六百二十个村里展开，到十二月十三日已完成购粮任务百分之四十三点三三。到十二月十五日，已有百分之四十二点五的公粮送入国库。这次征粮购粮工作紧密地结合了生产和农业合作化运动。望奎县厢红七村党支部和村政府，在征粮购粮工作中，详细地检查了打场中的粗糙浪费现象，并具体帮助六个农业生产合作社制订了增产粮食的计划。呼兰县西八家子村支部，在征粮购粮宣传阶段，调查了农业生产合作社和互助组所存在的问题，并作了适当解决；在帮助农民计算卖粮数目时，又帮助农民制订了冬季生产计划和一九五五年扩大生产的计划，尽一切可能帮助农民增产粮食。这就使西八家子村不但迅速完成了购粮任务，而且妥善地组织了冬季生产，发展了互助合作组织。　（黑龙江日报编辑部）
    加强对国营商业部门的领导
    由于中共太原市委加强对国营贸易企业部门中基层党组织的领导，太原市百货公司党支部的工作有了显著的转变。支部很注意改正自己工作中的缺点，并随时和贸易工作中的不良现象进行斗争。支部并带动所有工作人员，仔细研究了顾客对商品的需要；对行政上每月所作的计划、方案也进行了认真的研究，提出意见。当国家计划宣布以后，党支部就组织党员全力贯彻执行，并定期作出执行工作的总结。由于党员的带头和全体职工的努力，该公司在去年第四季度开展社会主义的工作竞赛以来，大大改善了经营管理和对顾客服务的态度，超额完成了十月和十一月份的销售计划。
    太原市委曾组织所属贸易企业单位中党支部书记，列席了太原市百货公司党支部的一些会议，并进行了座谈，以便向他们学习。　　（胡同心）
      领导牧民防灾保畜
    内蒙古阿鲁科尔沁旗德博勒努图克中共温都包嘎查支部，正在领导牧民积极进行防灾保畜工作。温都包嘎查是由五个自然村组成的。去年由于雨水多，一个自然村的冬春牧场被水冲了；两个自然村的一部分牧场上积了水。因此温都包嘎查冬春的保畜工作不只应做好打草、搭圈、搭棚等工作，而且又必须解决三个自然村的牧场问题。温都包嘎查党支部根据这一情况召开了党员大会，讨论了战胜自然灾害、做好过冬过春准备工作问题。决定动员被水冲了牧场的牧民，到曹达拉牧场上过冬过春；动员缺春季牧场的两个自然村的牧民到白音图布德的牧场上过春天。会后，支部又动员了青年团、妇联、民兵等各个团体的力量，在牧民中进行广泛的宣传，动员和组织牧民迁移牧场。经过宣传和组织工作要到白音图布德的牧场上过春的两个自然村的牧民组，在去年十一月初旬，已准备好了人畜使用的一切设备；要到曹达拉牧场上过冬的一个自然村的牧民也搭圈、搭棚，做好了准备工作。

    桃溪乡党员增强团结
    江西宜黄县桃溪乡岱唐农业生产合作社社长邹怀早和副社长唐三黑都是共产党员。但是，他们两人互不服气，谁也瞧不起谁，对社里的工作不商量，甚至还为一些小事吵架，影响了社的巩固和团结。
    桃溪乡党支部及时召开党员大会，讲解了党的四中全会关于增强党的团结的决议，开展了批评和自我批评。唐三黑沉痛地检讨说：“以前我和邹怀早闹不团结，主要是骄傲自满情绪作怪，认为自己在工作上有一套，瞧不起别人。继续发展下去，就会给党的事业带来损失。”邹怀早也作了自我检讨，他说：“社里的事我没和大家商量，一个人决定了就算。平时对唐三黑有意见也不当面提，背后乱发牢骚，影响到党的团结。今后我一定按四中全会决议的精神办事：有利于党的团结的事就做，不利于党的团结的事就不做，发扬民主，和大家共同把社办好。”党员余英善也检讨了自己对党内不团结现象，抱着“你们在台上做戏，我在台下看戏”的自由主义态度。
    经过这次思想检查，党员们都受到很大教育，为支部今后开展批评和自我批评创造了良好的开端。（中共宜黄县委组织部支部调查研究组）
