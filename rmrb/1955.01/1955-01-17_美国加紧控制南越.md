Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 16th. Reports from Saigon indicate that the United States is stepping up its control over South Vietnam. According to newspaper reports, in accordance with the military plan of U.S. Special Envoy Collins, the United States, in addition to thoroughly reorganizing the South Vietnamese army to make it a force controlled by the United States, also plans to directly train and equip six divisions of armed "police forces" for the Ngo Dinh Diem group in 1955. This will intensify the suppression of the people, eliminate opposition forces, and threaten the peace of Vietnam. According to reports, this force will be stationed in the areas vacated by the Vietnamese People's Army and in the areas where former South Vietnamese Army Chief of Staff Nguyen Van Hinh had greater influence in central and southern Vietnam. Currently, the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem group are forcibly conscripting soldiers from among the North Vietnamese Catholics and Nung people whom they have abducted and transported to South Vietnam.

U.S. officers have further infiltrated the main departments of the South Vietnamese puppet army. In early December last year, three U.S. military advisors began to carry out their mission of strengthening and further controlling the puppet army at the South Vietnamese Army General Staff Headquarters. The South Vietnamese army officer schools in Da Lat, Thu Duc, and Guan Zhu have all been reorganized using American training methods, and American officers have visited these schools for inspection.

Newspaper reports point out that the United States is also actively seizing economic dominance in South Vietnam. Starting in 1955, the United States has bypassed France and provided "direct aid" to South Vietnam. At the same time, the United States will obtain the right to "supervise South Vietnamese imports." The United States also plans to abolish the Indochina currency issued by the French Banque de l'Indochine and replace it with Vietnamese currency issued by the Ngo Dinh Diem group with the U.S. dollar as its fund in the market.

    美国加紧控制南越
   【新华社河内十六日电】来自西贡的消息说明，美国控制南越的步骤正在加紧进行中。据报纸消息说，按照美国特使柯林斯的军事计划，美国除了要彻底改组南越陆军，使他成为一支由美国控制的部队外，还计划在一九五五年内，直接为吴庭艳集团训练和装备六个师的武装“警察部队”，来加紧镇压人民，铲除反对势力，并威胁越南的和平。据消息说，这支部队将驻扎在越南人民军撤离的地区和中越南部前南越陆军参谋长阮文馨势力较大的地区。目前，美国和吴庭艳集团正在那些被他们劫运到南越去的北越天主教徒和侬族人民中间强制征兵。
    美国军官已进一步渗入南越伪军的主要部门。去年十二月初，三个美国军事顾问已开始到南越陆军总参谋部去执行他们加强并进一步控制伪军的任务。大叻、守德、贯竹等地的南越陆军军官学校已全部改用美国训练方法，美国军官并曾到这些学校去视察。
    报纸消息指出，美国还在南越积极夺取经济支配地位。从一九五五年起，美国已撇开法国，给南越以“直接援助”。同时，美国将取得“监督南越进口”的权利。美国还计划取消法国东方汇理银行发行的印度支那币，而由以美元作为基金的吴庭艳集团发行的越南币流通市场。
