    Happy New Year, Friends
    Soviet Writer, Stalin Prize Winner, Bao·Polevoi
    Our life is always arranged in such a way that no matter how fruitful and rich the past year has been, the new, upcoming year always foreshadows new, greater joy for all of us, and unfolds broader prospects for every Soviet person, foreshadowing the realization of the most beautiful ideals and the most dauntless plans.
    Nineteen fifty-four was such a year. For our country, it was a year of new victories for honest Soviet laborers, a year of increased great friendship between the peoples of the two great nations of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and also a year of successive victories for peace-loving forces. If the barometer of public opinion in this year has been favorable to peace against all the conspiracies of the war instigators, then this should certainly be attributed first of all to the efforts of the Soviet Union, China, and other countries in the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism.
    Dear Chinese friends!
    According to the ancient traditions of our people, every New Year one always thinks of one's closest and most beloved people. At our New Year's banquet, we will think of you—the heroic, hardworking, and selfless people of China, who are so far away and yet so close to us all. We will think of the victories you have won under the banner of the glorious Chinese Communist Party, long tested in battle and labor, of the great construction you are carrying out throughout the country, of the long-standing cultural achievements of your history, whose cultural brilliance, newly inspired by socialist thought, is radiating new splendor. This brilliance, through the creative and wonderful performances of song and dance troupes, through films, through various exhibitions, and through the works of your excellent writers, has reached us here. These excellent works by these writers have been warmly loved by Soviet readers, and I want to point out that the demands of Soviet readers are very high.
    Comrades and friends!
    Our New Year's banquet is expanding immeasurably.
    This year, nine hundred million people are participating in the New Year's banquet—nine hundred million free, happy people! And our countries have so many true friends who, although they still live a miserable life under the shackles of capitalist enslavement, wholeheartedly yearn for us, yearn for happiness and justice. They are celebrating the New Year with us today.
    On this New Year's occasion, I would like to embrace and shake hands intimately with every Chinese man and woman. But even the longest-lived person, spending his entire life, could not accomplish this. You know, there are six hundred million of you—our faithful and sincere friends! I take this opportunity, through your beloved newspaper, to send my best wishes to all Chinese friends from afar. I wish Chinese friends even more brilliant achievements in the new year to come, in the great labor of transforming the face of the ancient land of China. At the same time, I would like to respectfully wish my friends who are engaged in writing to carry out more fruitful labor for the glory of their great people. Exert all your talents and skills to serve the people, and use your works to help the entire people realize their dreams and hopes for generations to come. Our dear friends! Happy New Year! I wish you new, more glorious, and infinitely complete happiness.

    恭贺新年，朋友们
    苏联作家  斯大林奖金获得者  鲍·波列沃伊
    我们的生活总是这样安排的：刚过去的一年无论是多么果实累累和丰富多采，而新的，即将到来的一年总是向我们大家预示着新的，更大的欢乐，并且向每一个苏维埃人展开更加广阔的前途，预示着最美丽的理想和大无畏的计划的实现。
    一九五四年就是这样的一年，对于我国来说，它是诚实的苏维埃劳动者获得新胜利的一年，是苏联和中华人民共和国这两个伟大国家的人民的伟大友谊增进的一年，这一年同时也是爱好和平力量节节胜利的一年。如果说这一年公众舆论的晴雨表是违背了战争挑拨者的一切阴谋诡计而有利于和平的话，那末这当然首先应归功于苏联、中国与和平、民主和社会主义阵营其他国家的努力。
    亲爱的中国朋友们！
    按照我国人民的古老传统，每逢新年总要想到自己最亲近和最敬爱的人。我们在新年的宴席上就会想到你们——和我们大家如此遥远而又亲近的人民中国的英勇、勤劳和忘我的人们。我们会想到你们在光荣的、在战斗和劳动中久经考验的中国共产党的旗帜下所获得的胜利，会想到你们在全国各地所进行的伟大建设，会想到你们的历史悠久的文化成就，这种因社会主义思想而焕然一新的文化光芒正放射出新的光彩。这种光芒，通过歌舞团创造性的精彩表演，通过电影，通过各种展览会和通过你们优秀作家的作品达到了我们这里。这些作家的优秀作品已为苏维埃读者所热烈喜爱，我要指出，苏联读者的要求是很高的。
    同志们和朋友们！
    我们新年的宴会是无比地扩大了。
    今年参加新年宴会的有九万万人——自由的、欢乐的九万万人！而我们这些国家还有着那么多真正的朋友，虽然他们现在仍然在资本主义奴役的束缚下过着悲惨的生活，但他们是全心全意地向往着我们，向往着幸福和正义。他们今天和我们在一起欢度新年。
    在此新年之际，我很想同每一个中国男女紧紧地拥抱，亲密地握手。但是即使最长寿的人，尽他一生的时间，这一点也是办不到的。要知道，你们——我们忠实的、真诚的朋友——有六万万之多啊！我趁此机会，通过你们的、为大家所热爱的报纸向所有的中国朋友遥致祝词。祝中国朋友在新的即将到来的一年中，在改造古老中国大地的面貌的伟大劳动中获得更加辉煌的成就。我同时要敬祝我的从事文字工作的朋友们为自己伟大人民的光荣而进行更加富有成果的劳动。竭尽自己所有的才能和技巧为人民服务，用自己的作品帮助全体人民实现世世代代的梦想和希望。我们亲爱的朋友们！恭贺新年！祝你们获得新的、更加光辉和无限美满的幸福。
