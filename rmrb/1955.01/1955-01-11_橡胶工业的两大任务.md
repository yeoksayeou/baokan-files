Two Major Tasks of the Rubber Industry
Lin Yuan, Director of the Rubber Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry

From November 27th to December 4th last year, the Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Local Industry, and the Light Industry Working Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions jointly convened the National Rubber Industry Technological Innovation Experience Exchange Conference. After careful discussion and research, this conference clarified the direction and requirements for the rubber industry to carry out labor emulation and technological innovation in the future. National rubber industrial enterprises will improve their technical level to ensure the completion of the following two major tasks in 1955: First, improve the quality of rubber products, increasing the driving mileage of automobile tires to 25,000 to 30,000 kilometers; increase the service life of rubber shoes by 25% to 30%. Second, while improving product quality, save 1,500 tons of raw rubber.

Completing the task of improving product quality is equivalent to increasing production by a quarter to a fifth based on the original quality. This will not only increase national revenue but also better meet social needs. For example, if the service life of automobile tires can reach 25,000 to 30,000 kilometers, it would be equivalent to saving approximately 260 billion yuan annually, which could be used to build two factories with an annual output of 10 million pairs of rubber shoes. Increasing the service life of rubber shoes by 30% would save a total of 100.6 billion yuan annually. Raw rubber is imported from foreign countries, and saving raw rubber can save the country funds and reduce foreign exchange expenditures. Because raw rubber accounts for a large proportion of the cost factors of rubber products and plays a leading role in the level of costs, saving raw rubber can also reduce costs.

Improving product quality and saving raw rubber is based on reliable factors. In terms of the technical conditions of raw materials, whether it is fiber materials, chemical raw materials, metal materials, or reclaimed rubber, improvements can be achieved through our efforts and the support and cooperation of various industrial and trade departments. The transportation departments have made great improvements in the use, storage, and transportation of automobile tires in the past two years. These are favorable objective factors.

The quality of rubber products currently fluctuates greatly. With the same raw materials, the same level of equipment, and the same technological process, even automobile tires manufactured by the same enterprise in the same period have mileage ranging from over 30,000 kilometers to around 10,000 kilometers. In terms of rubber shoes, the styles and quality of products from the Shanghai Sino-Private Joint Venture Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory and Zhengtai Rubber Factory are more popular among the masses than those from state-owned and local state-owned enterprises. The shortcomings of the state-owned No. 8 Rubber Factory's sports shoes, such as being non-wear-resistant, cracking, and the sponge hardening, have not been completely overcome. Rubber shoes from the state-owned No. 2 Rubber Branch Factory also have cracking problems. These are all caused by weak technical management. Therefore, it is entirely possible to strengthen the leadership of technical work, improve some shortcomings in product design and manufacturing, strengthen the management of the technological process, and improve product quality.

The waste phenomenon in various enterprises is also quite serious. The amount of rubber used per tire varies from one kilogram to two kilograms, and the rubber content of rubber shoe outsoles ranges from 27% to 45%. Furthermore, reclaimed rubber has not yet been well utilized to replace raw rubber. In addition, high scrap rates, large rubber losses, and high rework rates, although not widespread serious phenomena, are not isolated problems for individual enterprises. If the "edge tearing" problem of cord fabric used in automobile tires in state-owned rubber factories can be completely overcome, then, according to this year's planned output, 10 million meters of cord fabric and 17 tons of raw rubber can be saved. If the average amount of rubber used per tire is reduced by one kilogram, 100 tons of raw rubber can be saved for every 100,000 tires. Other rubber products also have more or less wasted raw rubber.

This conference determined that the rubber industry should improve product structure, rationally adopt technical and economic quotas, strengthen process regulation management, unify operating methods, strengthen inspection and testing work, and use substitutes and other raw materials (such as clay and latex) rationally from an economic and technical feasibility perspective, as well as strengthen the repair and maintenance of machinery and equipment, and improve production and labor safety conditions. This is the direction of efforts to improve product quality and save raw rubber. This conference also summarized seventeen advanced experiences, such as the staged mixing method and the gradual heating and cooling mold-opening vulcanization method, and particularly studied the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in implementing technical conditions for technical management. These advanced experiences are of universal significance to the national rubber industry, and as long as each factory earnestly studies and promotes them, the completion of the national plan and the realization of the two major tasks of improving product quality and saving raw rubber will be guaranteed.

In order to achieve these two major tasks, it is necessary to overcome and prevent the complacency of some leading cadres. Some leading comrades of state-owned factories, especially larger factories, believe that their factories are large, developing rapidly, and technologically advanced, and therefore are not active enough in actively improving product quality, and improving management and technical levels. This is a very wrong idea. In fact, the development of the rubber industry still has a big gap with the requirements of the country and the people for our rubber industry, and with the greater tasks brought to us by the rapid development of national economic construction. The above-mentioned product quality situation illustrates the truth about the so-called "technological advancement." We should be "honest and diligent, help each other, and resolutely avoid any exaggeration and pride."

A saying is also circulating among some cadres that saving raw rubber is opposed to improving product quality, and that exploring potential capabilities only requires improving product service life, without emphasizing saving raw rubber. In fact, although improving product use value is a major issue, it is also wrong to ignore the existing serious waste phenomenon and waste national wealth uselessly. We require improving product service life based on improving technical and management levels, and also saving raw rubber. These two tasks are unified, not opposed.

Although the tasks are heavy, they can be completed as long as the enthusiasm and creativity of all employees are brought into play. Therefore, bureaucratic leadership styles that fail to adopt and promote employees' rationalization proposals in a timely manner and turn a blind eye to violations of labor discipline and shoddy manufacturing must be corrected.

    橡胶工业的两大任务
    轻工业部橡胶工业管理局局长  林源
    去年十一月二十七到十二月四日，轻工业部、地方工业部和中华全国总工会轻工业工会工作委员会，共同召开了全国橡胶工业技术革新经验交流大会。这次大会经过慎重的讨论和研究，明确了橡胶工业今后开展劳动竞赛和技术革新的方向和要求。全国橡胶工业企业将提高技术水平，保证一九五五年完成以下两大任务：一、提高橡胶制品的质量，汽车轮胎的行驶里程提高到二万五千公里至三万公里；胶鞋的穿用寿命提高百分之二十五至三十。二、在提高产品质量的条件下，节约生胶一千五百吨。
    完成提高产品质量的任务，按效果来说，就等于按原来的质量增加了四分之一至五分之一的产量，这不仅给国家增加收入，并能更好地满足社会需要。例如，汽车轮胎的使用寿命如果都能达到二万五千公里到三万公里，即相当于每年节约两千六百多亿元左右，可建设两个年产一千万双胶鞋的工厂；提高胶鞋穿用寿命百分之三十，全年共可节约一万零六百亿元。生胶是由外国进口的，节约了生胶，就可以为国家节约资金，减少外汇。由于生胶在橡胶制品成本因素中占的比重很大，对成本的高低起着主导作用，所以节约生胶也可以降低成本。
    提高产品质量和节约生胶是有可靠的根据的。这就是在原材料技术条件方面，无论是纤维材料，化学原料，金属材料或再生胶，经过我们的努力争取，以及各工业部门和贸易部门的支持和配合，是可以得到一定的改进的。交通运输部门对汽车轮胎的使用保管和运输，近两年来有很大的改进。这是有利的客观因素。
    橡胶制品的质量，目前的波动性还很大。同样的原材料，同样的设备水平，同样的工艺过程，甚至同一个企业同一个时期制造的汽车轮胎，行驶里程就有高到三万公里以上，低到一万公里左右的情况。在胶鞋方面，上海公私合营大中华橡胶厂和正泰橡胶厂产品的式样和质量，都比国营和地方国营的更受群众欢迎。国营第八橡胶厂的球鞋的不耐磨、开裂、海绵发硬等毛病，还没有彻底克服。国营第二橡胶分厂的胶鞋也有开裂的毛病。这些都是因为技术管理的薄弱而造成的。因此，加强对技术工作的领导，改进产品设计和制造上的某些缺点，加强工艺过程的管理，提高产品质量是完全可能的。
    各个企业的浪费现象也是相当严重的。每条轮胎的用胶量有多到一公斤至两公斤的，胶鞋大底的含胶率从百分之二十七到百分之四十五不等。又如目前还没能很好地利用再生胶代替生胶。此外，废品率大，胶的流失量大，回制率高等，虽然不是普遍存在的严重现象，但也不是个别企业的问题。如果国营橡胶厂的汽车轮胎用的帘子布的“扯边”问题能够完全克服，那么，按今年的计划产量就可节约一千万公尺帘子布和十七吨生胶。如果每条轮胎的用胶量平均少用一公斤，每十万条就可节约生胶一百吨。其他橡胶制品也或多或少地有浪费生胶现象。
    这次大会确定：橡胶工业应该改进产品结构，合理地采用技术经济定额，加强工艺规程管理，统一操作方法，加强检查和检验工作，并从经济上的合理性和技术上的可能性使用原材料的代用品和其他原料——陶土，乳胶等，以及加强机械设备的检修和保养，改进生产和劳动安全条件。这是提高产品质量和节约生胶的努力方向。这一次大会也总结了分段炼胶法、逐步升温冷却启模加硫法等十七个先进经验，特别学习了苏联技术管理方面的实施技术条件的先进经验，这些先进经验都是对全国橡胶工业有普遍意义的，只要各工厂认真学习和推广，完成国家计划，实现提高产品质量和节约生胶的两大任务就有保证。
    为了实现这两大任务，必须克服和防止某些领导干部的自满情绪。有的国营工厂尤其是比较大的工厂的领导同志，认为自己的工厂大，发展快，技术先进，因而对积极改进产品质量，提高管理水平和技术水平都不够积极。这是十分错误的思想，事实上，橡胶工业的发展，同国家和人民对我们橡胶工业的要求，同国家经济建设的迅速发展给我们带来的更多更大的任务，还有着很大的距离。上述的产品质量情况就说明了所谓“技术先进”的真相。我们应该“老老实实，勤勤恳恳，互勉互助，力戒任何的虚夸和骄傲。”
    在某些干部中还流传着一种说法，认为节约生胶跟提高产品质量是对立的，认为发掘潜在能力只有提高产品使用寿命，而不必强调节约生胶。事实上，提高产品使用价值虽然是一个主要问题，但是，如不正视存在的严重浪费现象，无益地耗费国家的财富也是不对的。我们要求在提高技术水平和管理水平的基础上提高产品使用寿命，并且又节约生胶，这两个任务是统一的，而不是对立的。
    任务虽然繁重，但只要发挥全体职工的积极性和创造性就可以完成。因此，对那些不及时地采纳和推广职工的合理化建议，对那些违反劳动纪律、粗制滥造现象熟视无睹的官僚主义领导作风，都必须加以纠正。
