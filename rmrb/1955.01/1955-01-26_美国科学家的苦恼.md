The condemnation of conscience

    A recent editorial in the American magazine "Christian Century" talked about the dissatisfaction and unease of American scientists.
    "Christian Century" said: "The troubles of our American scientists are growing" because they feel they are "living under the surveillance of the FBI."
    "Christian Century" also revealed that many American scientists are "distressed" because they "find that they are no longer an ordinary, pure person as they and others expected, but are involved in a cruel war for power." "He watched his science turn from theory to human massacre." "Christian Century" wrote: Some American scientists, in order to comfort their conscience, "deny that they should be morally responsible for the consequences of their work. But how can this convince oneself?"

Suffering discrimination

    An investigation report by a House subcommittee recently published by the U.S. government revealed the discrimination suffered by many scientists recruited into U.S. military research institutions by U.S. soldiers. The report quoted John William Marchetti, head of electronic research at the Cambridge Air Force Research Center in the United States, as saying: "In a famous U.S. Air Force research and development center, it is said that the hierarchy in the officers' club is arranged as follows: officers, soldiers, dogs, civilians."

No freedom to travel

    In order to collect materials for his new book and study economic problems in Western Europe, the famous American international economist Dr. Otto Nathan applied to the U.S. government for a passport to travel abroad at the end of 1952. Three months later, the State Department asked him a series of questions: Was he a Communist? What public gatherings had he attended? What kind of friends did he have? What did he talk about with his friends? … Dr. Nathan answered these questions in writing. However, after a year and a half, Dr. Nathan's application was finally rejected. An official in charge of visas told him: "It's right not to give you a visa; it would be terrible if we issued you a passport. You have made many friends among the upper class in the country, but you have also made many friends on the left."
    U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, in his recent "Message on Foreign Economic Policy," grandiosely stated: "The United States remains committed to the goal of freedom of travel throughout the world. Encouraging foreign travel is extremely important because of its cultural and social importance to the free world and because of its economic benefits."

Einstein would rather be a peddler

    The famous scientist Einstein wrote to the American magazine "Reporter" in mid-November last year, talking about the persecution of American atomic scientists Oppenheimer and other scientists by the American government, and said with emotion: "If I could be young again and decide on a way to make a living again, I would not want to be a scientist, scholar, or teacher. I would rather choose to be a plumber or a street vendor, because in the current environment there is still hope of achieving some degree of independence."
    Einstein's sigh is not without reason. He fled to the United States in 1933 because he was persecuted by Hitler, but now he finds that an honest scientist cannot live in peace in the United States either. His scientific masterpiece "Relativity" has been listed as a banned book in some parts of the United States, and he himself has been scolded by McCarthy as an "enemy of the United States."

    The reactionary ruling group in the United States forces scientists to serve them and uses the results of scientific research to massacre peaceful people.

### 美国科学家的苦恼

    美国科学家的苦恼
    良心的谴责
    美国刊物“基督教世纪”最近发表的一篇社论，谈到了美国科学家们不满和不安情绪。
    “基督教世纪”说：“我们美国科学家们的苦恼正在增长”，因为他们感到，自己“生活在联邦调查局的监视之下”。
    “基督教世纪”报透露，还有许多美国科学家“苦恼”的是，他们“发觉自己已不再是一个如人们和他自己所期望的做一个普通的、纯洁的人，而是参与了一个残酷的追逐强权的战争”。“他眼看着他的科学从理论转向人类大屠杀”。“基督教世纪”报写道：有的美国科学家为了安慰自己的良心，“他否认他对他的工作的后果应负道义上的责任。但是，这怎能使自己信服呢？”
    遭受歧视
    美国官方不久以前发表的一个众议院小组委员会的调查报告，透露了网罗在美国军事研究机关中的许多科学家受到美国军人歧视的情况。这个报告引述美国剑桥空军研究中心的电子研究负责人约翰·威廉·马尔蔡蒂的话说：“在一个著名的美国空军研究和发展中心，据说那里的军官俱乐部中的等级是这样排列的：军官、士兵、狗、文职人员。”
    旅行无自由
    美国著名国际经济学家奥托·纳坦博士为了替自己的新著作搜集材料和研究西欧的经济问题，在一九五二年底曾向美国政府申请护照出国旅行。三个月之后，国务院向他提出了一连串问题：是不是共产党人？参加了那些公众集会？有些什么样的朋友？同朋友们谈些什么？……纳坦博士用书面回答了这些问题。但是经过了一年半之后，纳坦博士的申请终于被拒绝。负责签证的一个官员对他说：“不给你签证是太对了，要是发给你护照才糟糕。你在国内的上流人物中交了不少朋友，但是你也交了许多左派的朋友。”
    美国总统艾森豪威尔在他最近提出的“对外经济政策咨文”中却还冠冕堂皇地说：“美国仍然信守全世界旅行自由的目标。由于国外旅行在文化和社会方面对自由世界的重要性以及由于它的经济利益，鼓励国外旅行是极度重要的。”
    爱因斯坦宁愿当小贩
    著名的科学家爱因斯坦在去年十一月中旬写信给美国“报道者”杂志，谈到美国原子科学家奥本海迈和其他科学家被美国政府迫害的情形时，感慨地说：“如果我能够返老还童，重新决定谋生之道的话，我不愿去当科学家、学者或教师。我宁愿选择做一个铅匠或沿街叫卖的小贩，因为这样在现今环境下还有希望能够得到某种程度的独立。”
    爱因斯坦的感叹不是没有原因的。他在一九三三年因为遭受希特勒的迫害流亡到美国，现在却发现一个正直的科学家在美国同样无法安身。他的科学巨著“相对论”已在美国的一些地方被列为禁书，他自己并曾被麦卡锡辱骂为“美国的敌人”。（附图片）
