Iron and Steel Industry

    By December 24th, all major products of enterprises under the Iron and Steel Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry had completed last year's national production plan ahead of schedule, ranging from seven to thirty-nine days. The completion rates were: iron ore 107%, metallurgical coke 100.3%, pig iron 110.4%, steel 102.2%, and steel products 108.9%. Ninety-two percent of the enterprises under the bureau had comprehensively completed their annual major product plans ahead of schedule. It is estimated that by the end of December, the output of the five major products will exceed the national plan by 2% to 12% respectively.

    Last year, while strengthening enterprise production management, the Iron and Steel Industry Administration Bureau focused on promoting advanced experiences in production technology, enabling major products to complete the national production plan each quarter. Major indicators have greatly improved. Compared with 1953, the effective volume required to produce one ton of pig iron in January-October last year decreased by 0.11 cubic meters; the steel output per square meter of hearth area in existing open-hearth furnaces increased by 0.401 tons; due to the basic stability of blast furnace operations, the shutdown rate decreased by 0.8% compared with 1953, and the cold repair rate decreased by 3.14%. In particular, blast furnaces basically eliminated nodulation accidents, and accident losses last year decreased by 60% compared to the previous year.

    Last year, the Iron and Steel Industry Administration Bureau system successfully trial-produced 30 new electric furnace steel grades, and 14 new grades of ordinary steel, new specifications of rolled products, and refractory materials, continuously providing new raw materials for national defense industry and industrial construction.

      Power Industry

    The national state-owned power industry overfulfilled last year's power generation plan by 1.7% ahead of schedule on December 20th. It is estimated that by the end of the year, power generation can exceed the annual plan by 5.4%; the total output value can exceed the plan by 5.7%; and the main technical and economic indicators can also overfulfill the planned targets. In addition, it can overfulfill the state-stipulated annual profit plan by 22%, and the unit cost of electricity sales can also be reduced by 6.38%.

    In 1954, the electricity sales volume of the state-owned power industry increased by approximately 23.5% compared to 1953. In order to ensure the electricity needs of industry, many newly built and expanded power plants across the country were put into production last year, increasing equipment capacity by 13.9%. In addition, the power system also actively carried out work to increase revenue and reduce expenditure and tap internal potential. Last year, approximately 30,000 kilowatts of incomplete equipment were repaired and put back into production; many local power bureaus also carried out load adjustment and electricity conservation work. It is estimated that from January to September, more than 140 million kilowatt-hours of electricity were saved nationwide, and if the saved electricity were used for steelmaking, it could produce more than 164,700 tons of steel.

    Railway Transportation

    The national railways completed last year's transportation plan ahead of schedule. As of December 28th, in addition to completing the original annual loading plan, they loaded more than 12,000 additional carloads of goods.

    In line with the speed of China's industrial development, the main industrial products transported by rail last year have greatly increased compared to the previous year. As of December 28th, the total transportation volume of coal and coke last year increased by 18.5% compared to the previous year, the transportation volume of crude oil increased by 6.1%, the transportation volume of metal ore increased by 10.9%, the transportation volume of cement increased by 8.2%, and the transportation volume of salt increased by 33.2%. Last year, due to the large-scale capital construction work carried out in various regions, the transportation volume of mineral building materials increased by 19.5% compared to the previous year, and the transportation volume of timber increased by 19.8%.

    Building Materials Industry

    The Building Materials Industry Administration Bureau system of the Ministry of Heavy Industry completed last year's total output value plan ahead of schedule by the beginning of December, and it is estimated that by the end of the year, it will produce an additional 173 billion yuan worth of products for the country. Cement, the main product in the building materials industry, is expected to produce more than 249,000 tons more than planned after completing the state plan ahead of schedule; glass is expected to produce more than 263,000 boxes more than planned after completing the state plan ahead of schedule. The labor productivity of building materials industry production workers increased by 7.7% compared to the original plan, and by 16.32% compared to 1953. Production costs decreased by 2.35% compared to the original plan, and by 7% compared to 1953. The turnover period of working capital was shortened by six days compared to the plan. Profits turned over to the state also overfulfilled the annual plan by 17.31%.

    Chemical Industry

    By December 22nd, the output of the sixteen major products produced by the Chemical Industry Administration Bureau system of the Ministry of Heavy Industry had all completed the national plan ahead of schedule. Based on the current actual completion situation, the Chemical Industry Administration Bureau's other production plan indicators are expected to be completed by the end of the year: the total output value can be completed at 112.3%, labor productivity can be completed at 112.6%, profits turned over to the state can be completed at 112%, and costs can be reduced by 3.76% compared to the plan. The output value and output of the chemical industry have greatly increased last year. If 1953 is taken as 100, it is estimated that the total industrial output value of the Chemical Industry Administration Bureau will increase to 143 this year; the output of major products will increase to 140.8 for sulfuric acid, 133 for ammonium sulfate, 140.9 for caustic soda, and 139.2 for soda ash.

      Light Industry

    Among the 38 major products of enterprises under the Ministry of Light Industry, as of December 15th, 16 of them had completed last year's output plan 16 days to one month ahead of schedule. The products that completed the annual plan ahead of schedule include bicycle tires, bicycle inner tubes, rubber shoes, and V-belts in the rubber industry; sulfathiazole, ephedrine for treating asthma, and short-wave electrotherapy devices in the pharmaceutical industry; paper pulp, cigarette paper, and cement bag paper in the papermaking industry; and canned food, soap, etc. In addition, it is expected that most of the other 22 major products can also overfulfill the annual national plan.

      Shenyang Wire Rod Factory

    The Shenyang Wire Rod Factory comprehensively completed last year's national plan on the 19th. Among them, the total output value, total commodity value, labor productivity, and profits turned over to the state have all exceeded the planned targets. The cost was 2.1% lower than the planned target, and the product quality met national standards. During the year, the factory's production of round steel, flat steel, wire rod, iron wire, and wire nails supplied the needs of many capital construction and industrial and mining production units.

    Five State-Owned Sugar Refineries in Guangdong

    Five state-owned sugar refineries in Guangdong Province completed last year's sugar production plan ten to sixteen days ahead of schedule. In the first half of the production season, these five sugar refineries had completed more than 76% of the annual sugar production plan. After the new production season began in November, workers in various factories launched labor competitions more universally, and comprehensively overfulfilled the national plan within one month. Production in December continued to increase steadily. The sugar content of the sugarcane delivered to the factories last year by hundreds of thousands of sugarcane farmers in the Yuezhong and Yuedong areas was higher than the national planned target, which enabled the factories to produce more sugar with the same amount of raw materials.

      Pingxiang Coal Mine

    The employees of Pingxiang Coal Mine, who completed last year's national coal production plan 55 days ahead of schedule, also overfulfilled the coal production increase plan nine days ahead of schedule. In the past forty days, the average daily output of Pingxiang Coal Mine has increased by more than 5.7% compared to before the completion of the national coal production plan. Now the employees have put forward the slogan: "Ensure no leave and no absenteeism before and after the New Year's Day and Spring Festival holidays," and strive to overfulfill the production plan for January 1955.

    State-Owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory

    The State-Owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory comprehensively completed last year's national plan ahead of schedule on December 22nd. The total output value was completed more than nine days ahead of schedule, the profits turned over to the state were completed 47 days ahead of schedule, and the output and quality of yarn and cloth also completed the plan. It is estimated that the cost for last year can be reduced by 2.3% compared to the national plan by the end of December.

    From January to November last year, the factory comprehensively and evenly completed various planned targets every month, which was a great improvement compared to the previous year. From the fourth quarter, the factory administratively learned the leadership methods of Soviet socialist enterprise management, implemented the "final account meeting system," conducted a comprehensive inspection of the completion of the production and financial plan, and proposed improvement measures for weak links. The amount of cotton used per piece of yarn in the fourth quarter of last year was an average of more than seven jin lower than in the first quarter.

    一九五四年内，国营电力工业的售电量比一九五三年约计增长了百分之二十三点五。为了保证满足工业对电力的需要，去年全国各地有不少新建和扩建的发电厂投入生产，设备容量增加了百分之十三点九。此外，电业系统还积极进行了开源节流、发挥内部潜力的工作。去年约有发电能力在三万瓩左右的残缺设备，经过修复后重新投入了生产；许多地区的电业局还进行了调整负荷和节约用电工作。估计一月到九月，全国共可节约用电一亿四千多万度，如果把节约的电力用来炼钢，可以炼十六万四千七百多吨。
    铁路运输
    全国铁路提前完成去年运输计划。到十二月二十八日止，除完成原定全年装车计划外，还多装了一万二千多车货物。
    和我国工业发展的速度相适应，去年经由铁路运输的主要工业产品都比前年有很大增长。到十二月二十八日止，去年煤和焦炭的总运量比前年增加了百分之十八点五，原油的运量增加了百分之六点一，金属矿石的运量增加了百分之十点九，水泥的运量增加了百分之八点二，盐的运量增加了百分之三十三点二。去年由于各地进行了规模较大的基本建设工作，因此矿物性建筑材料的运量比前年增加了百分之十九点五，木材的运量增加了百分之十九点八。
    建筑材料工业
    重工业部建筑材料工业管理局系统到十二月上旬提前完成了去年的生产总值计划，预计到年底还能多为国家生产价值一千七百三十亿元的产品。建筑材料工业中的主要产品水泥，在提前超额完成国家计划后，预计全年可比计划多生产二十四万九千多吨；玻璃在提前超额完成国家计划后，预计全年可比计划多生产二十六万三千多箱。建筑材料工业生产工人的劳动生产率，比原定计划提高百分之七点七，比一九五三年提高了百分之十六点三二。生产成本比原定计划降低百分之二点三五，比一九五三年降低了百分之七。流动资金周转期比计划缩短了六天。上缴利润也超额百分之十七点三一完成了全年计划。
    化学工业
    重工业部化学工业管理局系统去年生产的十六种主要产品产量，到十二月二十二日止，已全部提前超额完成了国家计划。根据目前实际完成情况，化学工业管理局的其他各项生产计划指标预计到年底：总产值可以完成百分之一百一十二点三，劳动生产率可以完成百分之一百一十二点六，上缴利润可以完成百分之一百一十二，成本可以比计划降低百分之三点七六。化学工业的产值和产量，去年有很大增长。如果以一九五三年为一百，预计化学工业管理局今年的工业总产值将增长到一百四十三；主要产品产量硫酸将增长到一百四十点八，硫酸铵——一百三十三，烧碱——一百四十点九，纯碱——一百三十九点二。
      轻工业
    轻工业部所属企业三十八种主要产品中，到十二月十五日为止，已有十六种提前十六天到一个月完成去年产量计划。提前完成全年计划的产品，橡胶工业方面有力车外胎、力车内胎、胶鞋、三角带；医药工业方面有用途很广的磺胺噻唑、治喘气的麻黄素、短波电疗器；造纸工业方面有纸浆、卷烟纸、水泥袋纸；此外还有罐头食品、肥皂等。另外的二十二种主要产品预计大部分也都可以超额完成全年国家计划。
