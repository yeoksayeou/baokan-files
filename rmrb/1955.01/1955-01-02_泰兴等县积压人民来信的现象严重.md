    Struggle Against Irresponsible Handling of Letters from the People

    To the Editor:
    Recently, the General Office of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China inspected the handling of people's letters in various regions and discovered that the phenomenon of delays and accumulation in the handling of people's letters by some units is quite serious. Looking at the people's letters transferred by the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to various regions for handling, a total of more than 380 letters transferred in 1953 have not yet received results. A total of 123 people's letters were transferred to various regions for investigation in the first quarter of 1954, and only 51 letters reported back with investigation and handling results by October 31st. A total of 7 letters were transferred to the Jiangning County Committee for investigation from January to July 1954, and only one letter was received by November, with no results for the remaining six; of the 15 letters transferred to the Taixing County Committee for investigation, only three were reported back. The Discipline Inspection Committee of the Taixing County Committee and the Office of the Supervisory Committee of the County People's Government had an accumulation of more than 200 people's letters. Some letters were repeatedly urged but not reported. For example, a letter from Xia Ping-shou and others reporting on Xia Qilong, the financial committee member of the township, which the Provincial Committee transferred to the Taixing County Committee for handling in 1952, had been urged six times but has still not been answered. A letter transferred by the Provincial Committee to the Huaiyin Prefectural Committee on November 7, 1953, regarding the "criticism from Ni Shanqing and others of Wu Lianke, the deputy director of the Huaiyin branch of the Miscellaneous Grain Experimental Farm, for his undemocratic leadership style," has been delayed for a year. Seven letters were sent to urge the handling, and two long-distance telephone calls were made, but the handling result has still not been reported.
    This phenomenon of delay and accumulation seriously affects the close relationship between the Party and the people. Some people's letters requested that their petitions be returned and questioned, "The newspapers say that they value people's letters, so why haven't you handled them after a year? Is it still unclear after such a long time?" Some even suspect that our organs are "officially protecting each other." There were also individual people who, because their problems could not be resolved for a long time, cried and took the train and boat to Nanjing, determined to have the Provincial Committee send someone to investigate and handle the matter with them.
    Why are people's letters delayed and accumulated? The main reason is that the cadres of these counties and districts do not pay enough attention to the work of handling people's letters. They regard the handling of letters as a "dispensable" and "unimportant" small matter. Therefore, they assign the work of handling people's letters to general cadres for copying and forwarding. This is an extremely harmful practice. In order to strengthen the connection between the Party and the masses, and to strengthen the masses' supervision of the work of the Party and government from below, I suggest that the Party and government in various regions conduct an inspection of the work of handling people's letters in their subordinate regions and units, quickly clear up the accumulated letters, improve the necessary systems, and earnestly do a good job in handling people's letters.

专栏：向不负责处理来信的现象作斗争

    泰兴等县积压人民来信的现象严重编辑同志：
    最近中共江苏省委办公厅检查了各地处理人民来信的情况，发现某些单位处理人民来信工作中拖延积压现象是相当严重的。就中共江苏省委转交各地办理的人民来信来看，一九五三年转出的人民来信，至今没有收到处理结果的共三百八十多件。一九五四年第一季度转各地调查的人民来信共一百二十三件，到十月三十一日止，回报调查处理结果的只有五十一件。一九五四年一月至七月转给江宁县委调查的来信共七件，至十一月份只收到一件，其余六件没有结果；转给泰兴县委调查的十五件，也只回报了三件。泰兴县委纪律检查委员会和县人民政府监察委员会办公室内的积压人民来信竟有二百多件，有些信件，是屡催不报的，如在一九五二年省委转请泰兴县委处理夏平寿等检举乡财经委员夏其龙一信，曾先后催办过六次，至今仍未见回答。一九五三年十一月七日省委转请淮阴地委处理“倪善庆等批评杂谷试验场淮阴分场副场长吴连科领导作风不民主等”问题的一封信，已拖延一年之久，曾去了七次信催办，两次用长途电话催办，但仍未报告处理结果。
    这种拖延积压现象，严重地影响了党和人民群众的密切联系。有些群众来信要求把他的请求书寄回，并质问：“报纸上说重视人民来信，为什么你们拖了一年还不处理呢？难道经过这样长的时间问题还弄不清吗？”有的甚至怀疑我们的机关是“官官相护”。还有个别群众，因为问题长期得不到解决，哭哭啼啼坐火车赶轮船跑到南京来，坚决要省委派人随同下去调查处理。
    为什么会对人民来信拖延积压呢？主要原因在于这些县、区干部对人民来信工作不够重视，他们把处理来信看成是“可有可无”“无关紧要”的小事情，因而他们把人民来信工作，交给一般干部去抄抄转转。这是极其有害的作法。为了加强党和群众的联系，加强群众自下而上对党和政府工作的监督。我建议各地党和政府对所属地区和单位的处理人民来信的工作做一番检查，迅速清理积压的信件，健全必要的制度，切实把人民来信工作做好。
