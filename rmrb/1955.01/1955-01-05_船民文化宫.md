    Boat People's Cultural Palace
    Hunan's first boat people's cultural palace has appeared in Changsha's Shuiluzhou. The cultural palace's auditorium can accommodate more than 1,200 people, with dressing rooms next to the stage. Upstairs, on either side of the projection room, there are reading rooms and various game rooms. There is also a newly built basketball court behind the auditorium. Soon, the boat people's clinic and the boatmen's children's school will also begin construction one after another.
    The Boat People's Cultural Palace started construction on September 18th of last year and was completed on December 25th. It will officially open in January of this year.
    In the old society, boat people and boatmen lived in poverty and were very depressed. Some people, because they had no proper places of entertainment, either gambled or drank heavily. The construction of this Boat People's Cultural Palace has been welcomed by boatmen and boat people in Hunan. Long Lingxiu (female), a boat person from Xiangtan Port, said: "Before liberation, once I was sitting on a stone slab in front of the Mobil Oil Company to cool off, and the American devils immediately chased me away. Now we have our own cultural palace. I will definitely repay the Party and the government's concern for us with practical actions of actively participating in transportation work." Liu Kelian, a boat person from Wangcheng Port, said excitedly: "I used to be illiterate, but now I can go to the cultural palace to learn culture."

    船民文化宫
    湖南第一座船民文化宫在长沙市水陆洲出现了。文化宫大礼堂能容纳一千二百多人，舞台旁边设有化妆室；楼上放映室的两侧有图书阅览室和各种游艺场。大礼堂后面还有新建的篮球场。不久，船民医疗所和船工子弟学校，也将陆续开工建设。
    船民文化宫从去年九月十八日开工，到十二月二十五日建成。今年一月就要正式开放了。
    在旧社会里，船民船工们生活贫困，心情很苦闷，有些人因为没有正当的娱乐场所，不是赌博就是酗酒。这次船民文化宫的兴建，受到了湖南船工船民的欢迎。湘潭港籍船民龙玲秀（女）说：“解放前我有一次坐在美孚油行门口的石板上乘凉，美国鬼子连忙把我撵走。现在我们有了自己的文化宫了。我一定要用积极参加运输工作的实际行动来报答党和政府对我们的关怀。”望城港籍船民刘克连兴奋地说：“我原来是文盲，现在可以到文化宫去学文化了。”
