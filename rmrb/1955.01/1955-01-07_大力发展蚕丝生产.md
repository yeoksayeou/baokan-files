    Vigorously Develop Silk Production
    The National Mulberry, Silkworm, and Silk Conference recently convened jointly by the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Textile Industry, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, has established the policy of vigorously developing silk production, requiring a return to the highest levels of silk production before the War of Resistance Against Japan by 1962. To change the current slow recovery and development of silk production in our country, the determination of this policy and requirement is very timely.
    China's silk production has a long history of more than four thousand years. Production areas are spread across twenty-three provinces. In the main production areas, income from silk production accounts for 40 to 60 percent of farmers' total annual income. Farmers in these regions say, "Two silkworm harvests a year are equivalent to half a year's grain." They are very clear about the importance of developing silk production.
    Silk is currently a major export commodity for our country. Chinese silk enjoys a high reputation in the international market. In 1954, silk exports could be exchanged for the equipment of fourteen 50,000-spindle spinning mills, or 10,000 Dett-brand tracked 54-horsepower tractors. Silk exports over five years could be exchanged for all the steel rails of the country's existing railways, or complete sets of equipment for twenty seamless steel tube plants. From this, it can be seen how significant the development of silk production is for promoting the country's socialist industrialization.
    Since liberation, China's silk production has developed year by year. Compared with 1950, silk production in 1954 increased by 73 percent, filature silk increased by 109 percent, and filature silk fabrics increased by 95 percent; the quality of cocoons, silk, and silk fabrics has also improved significantly. However, current cocoon production only reaches 30 percent of the highest pre-war output, and in some major production areas, there is still a downward trend. This situation is very incompatible with the rapid development of national industrial construction, the continuous improvement of people's living standards, and the increasing sales of silk at home and abroad.
    The main reason for the particularly slow recovery of silk production is that the mulberry orchards in many silkworm-producing areas suffered particularly severe damage from Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries; the mulberry trees that were cut down and burned cannot be quickly restored. After liberation, the People's Government was busy healing war wounds and focused on leading grain and cotton production in agricultural production, making it impossible to concentrate efforts on restoring silk production. At the same time, the leadership departments for silk production did not sufficiently recognize the characteristics of mulberry trees as perennial economic crops and did not foresee the increasing expansion of the silk market at home and abroad. Therefore, they lacked long-term plans and unified plans for the recovery and development of silk production, and even once adopted the wrong measures of maintaining production, lowering prices, and reducing purchases. This has aggravated the neglect and laissez-faire thinking of some cadres regarding silk production. Some cadres believe: "If grain and cotton tasks are not completed, there will be criticism; if silkworm tasks are not completed, it doesn't matter." Some cadres even mistakenly believe that developing silk production is developing rural capitalism, and not only do they not actively help farmers solve problems in silk production, but they even tell farmers: "Plant whatever you eat; planting mulberry trees means less grain distribution." These various erroneous practices have seriously affected the production enthusiasm of silkworm farmers and hindered the development of silk production. It must be understood that focusing on restoring grain and cotton production in the early days of liberation was completely correct. However, now that our country has entered a period of socialist industrialization, it is completely wrong to still fail to see the importance of developing silk production, to fail to understand the important significance of developing this large-scale, highly valuable export economic crop for supporting national industrial construction, and to fail to understand the growing need for silk as people's lives gradually improve. Therefore, Party and government leading organs in various localities must educate all rural work cadres, establish a comprehensive view of developing agricultural production, overcome the erroneous idea of not attaching importance to silk production, strengthen leadership over silk production, dispel the ideological concerns of silkworm farmers, stipulate appropriate prices, improve purchasing methods, and unleash the production enthusiasm of silkworm farmers. This is a decisive link in rapidly restoring and developing silk production and must be given special attention.
    To rapidly develop silk production under existing conditions, it is first necessary to consolidate existing silkworm areas and increase the unit yield of mulberry leaves and silkworm cocoons in existing silkworm areas; in areas with mulberry trees but no silkworm raising, mobilize farmers to actively raise silkworms; in addition, it is necessary to rapidly open up new silkworm areas in mountainous and hilly areas suitable for mulberry planting and silkworm raising.
    Existing silkworm areas are the main battleground for developing cocoon production at present. Agricultural production leadership organizations at all levels should quickly take effective measures to prevent the continued occurrence of digging up and cutting down mulberry trees, increase mulberry leaf production in existing silkworm areas, expand silkworm breeding, and increase cocoon production to ensure the supply of raw materials for the silk industry. Increasing mulberry leaf production is the primary link in increasing silk production. In order to increase the yield per unit area of mulberry orchards, it is necessary to mobilize silkworm farmers to strengthen mulberry tree cultivation, carry out intertillage, weeding, fertilization, pruning, filling gaps, and preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests; mulberry orchards that were flooded this year should be actively fertilized with topdressing to restore the vitality of mulberry trees. In the past, silkworm guidance work in various places was generally limited to seasonal silkworm-raising guidance; however, the various technical measures for planting mulberry trees and the masses' experience in high-yield production were not comprehensively and deeply summarized and promoted. In order to increase cocoon production, it is also necessary to strengthen technical guidance for silkworm raising, implement various technical measures, conscientiously learn advanced Soviet silkworm raising technology, summarize and promote the high-yield experience of mutual aid and cooperation organizations and silkworm-raising labor models in various places; and make full use of autumn mulberry leaves to expand autumn silkworm breeding and increase the total annual output.
    The existing area of mulberry orchards is far from meeting the needs of developing silk production. Various localities should conduct specific regional planning in mountainous and hilly areas suitable for planting mulberry trees and raising silkworms in a planned manner, and use gaps such as fieldsides, embankments, riverbanks, and front and back of houses to mobilize and organize farmers to vigorously open up new mulberry orchards. Planting mulberry trees in mountainous areas must be combined with soil and water conservation work. The state stipulates that those who cultivate public barren mountains and wasteland to plant mulberry trees have permanent land use rights, and are exempt from agricultural tax before the mulberry orchard yields benefits, and the agricultural tax will be appropriately reduced within a certain period when the benefits are not high, and the tax rate for mulberry orchards in mountainous areas is generally lower than that for mulberry orchards in flat areas. People's Banks and credit cooperatives in various localities should provide necessary loans and economic support to cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and individual farmers who have genuine difficulties in raising seedlings, planting mulberry trees, and raising silkworms based on specific circumstances. Supply and marketing cooperatives should promptly supply the seeds, fertilizers, silkworm rearing tools and other means of production required for planting mulberry trees and raising silkworms.
    The key to ensuring the completion of the mulberry leaf and cocoon production increase task is to resolutely rely on and promote the development of cooperation and mutual assistance. Based on the characteristics of silk production, silkworm areas have the conditions and the need to more rapidly develop cooperative mutual aid organizations. Farmers who organize to raise silkworms can not only rationally use labor and solve the contradiction between busy farming and busy silkworm raising in production, but also facilitate the improvement of technology and ensure a bumper harvest of cocoons, thereby ensuring that agricultural cooperatives increase their income. In some areas, due to the relaxation of leadership over silk production and the failure to regard silk production as a part of agricultural cooperation and mutual assistance, the assessment of mulberry orchards for production and the awarding of work points for silkworm raising are not reasonable enough, which has affected the enthusiasm of farmers to organize and develop production. This problem must be properly resolved in the course of developing agricultural mutual aid and cooperation, based on local conditions.
    State-owned companies and supply and marketing cooperatives should organize the timely and comprehensive purchase of cocoons and native silk produced by silkworm farmers in accordance with the purchase prices and standards stipulated by the state, simplify purchase procedures as much as possible, facilitate farmers' sales, strengthen market management, and fully grasp the source of goods. Purchasing agencies in various localities must promptly do a good job in propaganda mobilization and various preparations, strengthen the training of cocoon-receiving and cocoon-drying personnel, improve their political and professional level, correctly implement the price policy of "grading according to quality and pricing according to grade," and ensure that the degree of cocoon drying is appropriately dry and uniform, preventing phenomena such as being too old, too tender, or unevenly old and tender, in order to effectively ensure the quality of raw material cocoons and meet industrial needs.
    Silk production is highly technical and seasonal, and requires a considerable number of technicians and sound professional leadership organizations to provide timely and specific guidance. Each silk-producing area can, as needed, equip a certain number of mulberry planting and silkworm raising instructors in agricultural technology extension stations, conduct short-term training in a planned manner, improve their political and professional level, and rely on them to universally train mulberry planting and silkworm raising activists and cooperative technicians. In order to develop silkworm farming in new areas, old areas should support new areas and appropriately transfer a portion of technical cadres from old areas to work in new areas. This is a glorious task and should be well completed.
    Party and government leading organizations and relevant departments at all levels must attach importance to silkworm work, formulate plans for developing silk production based on local conditions, convene specialized meetings, and study specific policies and various technical measures for implementing the silk production policy. This year, special efforts should be made to manage mulberry orchards to ensure increased mulberry leaf production. Experience has proved that as long as Party and government organs at all levels strengthen leadership and fully mobilize and rely on the enthusiasm of farmers, it is entirely possible to complete and overfulfill the 1955 silk production task and strive to reach the highest pre-war level by 1962.

    大力发展蚕丝生产
    最近农业部、纺织工业部、对外贸易部、全国供销合作总社联合召开的全国桑蚕蚕丝会议，确定了大力发展蚕丝生产的方针，要求在一九六二年恢复到抗日战争以前蚕丝生产的最高水平。为了改变目前我国蚕丝生产恢复发展缓慢的状祝，这个方针和要求的确定是非常适时的。
    我国蚕丝生产已有四千多年的悠久历史。产区遍及二十三省。主要产区蚕丝生产的收入，占农民全年总收入的百分之四十到六十。这些地区的农民说，“一年两期蚕，相抵半年粮”。发展蚕丝生产的重要性，他们是非常明白的。
    丝绸是我国目前出口的一项主要商品。中国丝绸在国际市场上享有很高的声誉。一九五四年出口的丝绸，可换回十四个五万锭的纱厂的设备，或一万台德特链轨式五四匹马力的拖拉机。五年来出口的丝绸，可换回相当全国现有铁路的全部钢轨，或二十个无缝钢管厂的成套设备。由此可见，发展蚕丝生产，对促进国家社会主义工业化，有多么重大的意义。
    解放以后，我国的蚕丝生产逐年有所发展。如与一九五○年相比，一九五四年蚕丝生产增加了百分之七十三，厂丝增加了百分之一百零九，厂绸增加了百分之九十五；茧、丝、绸的质量也有了显著的提高。但是，目前的蚕茧生产，还只达到战前最高产量的百分之三十，有些主要产区，还有下降的趋势。这种情况，和国家工业建设迅速发展，人民生活水平的不断提高，丝绸内外销售量日渐增加的趋势是很不相称的。
    蚕丝生产恢复特别缓慢的主要原因，是由于许多桑蚕产区的桑园，遭受了日本帝国主义和国民党反动派特别严重的破坏；被砍伐烧毁的桑树，是不能迅速恢复的。解放以后，人民政府忙于医治战争创伤，在农业生产方面，着重了对粮棉增产工作的领导，不可能集中力量恢复蚕桑生产。同时，蚕丝生产的领导部门，对桑树是多年生的经济作物的特点认识不足，对国内外丝绸市场的日益扩大预见不够，因而对蚕丝生产的恢复发展，缺乏长远打算和统一计划，甚至一度采取了维持生产，调低价格，减少收购的错误措施。这就加重了某些干部对蚕丝生产不加重视和放任自流的思想。有的干部认为：
  “粮棉完不成任务要检讨，蚕桑完不成任务没有关系”。有的干部更错误地认为发展蚕桑生产就是发展农村资本主义，不仅不积极帮助农民解决蚕桑生产中存在的问题，甚至对农民说：“种啥吃啥，种桑就少分配粮食”。这种种错误作法，严重地影响了蚕农的生产情绪和阻碍了蚕丝生产的发展。必须了解，在解放初期着重恢复粮棉生产是完全正确的。但是，当着我国已经进入社会主义工业化建设时期，仍然看不见发展蚕丝生产的重要性，不了解发展这种大宗出口的价值很大的经济作物对支援国家工业建设的重要意义，不了解在人民生活逐步改善以后对于丝绸的日益增涨的需要，那就是十分错误的了。因此，各地党政领导机关，必须教育全体农村工作干部，树立全面发展农业生产的观点，克服不重视蚕丝生产的错误思想，并加强对蚕丝生产的领导，打破蚕农的思想顾虑，规定适当的价格，改进收购的办法，发挥蚕农的生产积极性。这是迅速恢复和发展蚕丝生产的决定环节，必须特别予以注意。
    要在现有条件下迅速发展蚕丝生产，必须首先巩固现有蚕区，提高现有蚕区桑叶蚕茧的单位产量；在有桑而未养蚕的地区，发动农民积极育蚕；此外，还要在适于栽桑养蚕的山区和丘陵地带迅速开辟新蚕区。
    现有蚕区是目前发展蚕茧生产的主要阵地。各级农业生产领导机构，应迅速采取有效措施，防止目前挖桑砍桑现象的继续发生，提高现有蚕区桑叶产量，扩大蚕的饲育量，增产蚕茧，以保证丝绸工业原料的供应。增产桑叶是增加蚕丝生产的首要环节。为了提高桑园的单位面积产量，要发动蚕农加强桑树培育，进行中耕、除草、施肥、整枝、补缺、防治病虫害等工作；今年被淹的桑园，更应该积极施用追肥，恢复桑树生机。过去各地的蚕桑指导工作，一般限于季节性的养蚕指导；但对栽植桑树的各项技术措施和群众的丰产经验，却未能全面深入地加以总结和推广。为了提高蚕茧生产，还必须加强养蚕的技术指导，贯彻各项技术措施，认真学习苏联先进养蚕技术，总结推广各地互助合作组织和养蚕劳动模范的丰产经验；并充分利用秋桑叶扩大秋蚕饲养，增加全年总产量。
    现有桑园面积，远不能满足发展蚕丝生产的需要。各地应有计划地在适宜于栽桑养蚕的山区和丘陵地带，进行具体的区域规划，并利用田边、堤岸、河畔、屋前屋后等隙地，发动和组织农民大力开辟新桑园。山地栽桑必须结合水土保持工作。国家规定，凡垦殖公有荒山荒地栽植桑树，有永久的土地使用权，并在桑园没有收益前免征农业税，在收益不多的一定时期内酌减农业税，而且山区桑园税率一般低于平地桑园。各地人民银行、信用合作社对育苗、栽桑、养蚕确有困难的合作社、互助组及个体农民，应根据具体情况，给予必要的贷款和经济扶持。供销合作社应及时供应栽桑，养蚕所需要的种籽、肥料、蚕具等生产资料。
    保证完成桑叶、蚕茧增产任务的关键是坚决依靠和促进合作互助的发展。根据蚕桑生产的特点，蚕区有条件也有必要更加迅速地发展合作互助组织。组织起来养蚕的农民，不仅可以合理使用劳动力，解决生产中耕种忙和育蚕忙的矛盾，而且便于改进技术，保证蚕茧丰收，从而保证农业合作社增加收入。某些地区由于放松了对蚕桑生产的领导，没有把蚕桑生产看成农业合作互助的一部分，桑园评产入股和养蚕记工评分不够合理，影响了农民组织起来发展生产的积极性。这个问题必须在发展农业互助合作的同时，根据当地具体情况妥善地加以解决。
    蚕农所产蚕茧、土丝，国营公司及供销合作社要按照国家规定的收购价格、标准，及时全面地组织收购，尽量简化收购手续，便利农民出售；并应加强市场管理，充分掌握货源。各地收购机构必须及时做好宣传动员和各项准备工作，加强收茧、烘茧人员的训练，提高他们的政治和业务水平，正确贯彻“按质评级、分等论价”的价格政策，并做到烘茧程度适干均匀，防止偏老偏嫩、老嫩不匀等现象，以切实保证原料茧品质，适应工业需要。
    蚕丝生产技术性高，季节性大，需要有相当数量的技术人员和健全的专业领导机构，进行及时、具体的领导。各蚕丝产区可根据需要，在农业技术推广站内配备一定数量的栽桑、养蚕指导员，有计划地进行短期训练，提高其政治业务水平，依靠他们普遍训练栽桑养蚕积极分子及合作社技术员。为了发展新区养蚕事业，老区要支援新区，由老区适当抽调一部分技术干部到新区工作。这是一个光荣的任务，应该很好地完成。
    各级党政领导机构和有关部门，必须重视蚕桑工作，根据当地具体情况，拟定发展蚕丝生产的计划，召开专业会议，研究贯彻蚕丝生产方针的具体政策和各项技术措施。今年特别要切实做好桑园的管理工作，以确保桑叶增产。经验证明，只要各级党政机关加强领导，充分发动和依靠农民的积极性，完成和超额完成一九五五年蚕丝生产任务，及争取在一九六二年达到战前最高水平，都是完全可能的。
