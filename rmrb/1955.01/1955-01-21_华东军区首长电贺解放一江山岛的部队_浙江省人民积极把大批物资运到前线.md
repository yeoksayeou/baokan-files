    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, January 20th. In order to actively support the People's Liberation Army in crossing the sea for combat, the people of various places in Zhejiang Province transported large quantities of rice, flour, soybeans, firewood, pork, eggs, cooking oil, fruit, and other various supplies to the front lines. After our army liberated Yijiangshan Island on the 18th, hundreds of porters in a certain coastal defense front area loaded supplies onto ships overnight and transported them to the island. Road construction workers on coastal highways braved the severe cold to open mountains and build roads, widening the original road surfaces and reinforcing the bridges, making automobile transportation more convenient. People in coastal counties also actively organized stretcher teams. Women in various places also enthusiastically participated in activities to support the front lines. Under the call of "Going all out to support the liberation of Taiwan," the staff of state-owned commercial departments in coastal counties also actively improved their working methods and service attitude, ensuring that wherever the troops go, supplies are provided.

    【新华社杭州二十日电】浙江省各地人民为了积极支援人民解放军渡海作战，把大批大米、白面、黄豆、木柴、毛猪、鸡蛋、食油、水果和其他各种物资运到了前线。十八日我军解放一江山岛后，海防前线某地数百名搬运工人连夜就把物资装船运到这个海岛上。沿海公路上的筑路工人冒着严寒开山筑路，并放宽原有公路的路面，加固公路的桥梁，更便利了汽车运输。沿海各县人民还纷纷组织了担架队。各地妇女也都踊跃地参加支援前线的活动。沿海各县国营商业部门的职工，在“全力支援解放台湾”的号召下，也积极地改进了工作方法和服务态度，做到部队到那里，物资供应到那里。
