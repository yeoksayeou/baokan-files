Xinhua News Agency, January 15th: China's highway construction saw great development in 1954. Eighteen highways, totaling more than 4,300 kilometers in length, were constructed and renovated with central government investment. Even more highways were constructed and renovated with local investment.

    The highways newly constructed with central government investment in 1954 were mostly located in remote areas inhabited by ethnic minorities. Among the more important ones were the Kangzang Highway, the Qingzang Highway, and the main highway on Hainan Island; also, the highways from Kunming to Fo Hai, from Chengdu to Aba, and from Xining to Yushu. These highways closely link the political, economic, and cultural centers and goods distribution centers of ethnic minority areas with cities, playing a significant role in developing the economy and culture of ethnic minorities. The Qingzang Highway was constructed at the fastest pace, with over 1,200 kilometers completed in 1954 alone. It meets the Kangzang Highway in Lhasa, connecting the transportation of Qinghai, Tibet, and Xikang provinces. The highway from Kunming to Fo Hai connects Fo Hai, the economic and trade center of the western part of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region in Yunnan, and the autonomous regions of the Gelang and Aini ethnic groups, with Kunming. The Miao people in the Wuling Mountains of western Hunan had long desired a highway from Changde on the banks of Dongting Lake to Baojing in the autonomous region, and this wish was also fulfilled in 1954.

    Many highways were newly constructed and renovated with local investment in 1954. In the Northeast region, nineteen highway construction and renovation projects further improved the transportation capacity of the dense network of highways. Highway transportation in the previously inconvenient Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau also developed rapidly. Seventy percent of the counties and districts in Guizhou Province are now connected to Guiyang City by highways. On the more than 600-kilometer section of the highway between Gansu and Xinjiang, from Dachaigou to the Yumen Oil Mine, over one hundred bridges and culverts were newly built and reinforced last year, dozens of sharp bends and steep slopes were realigned, and parts of the roadbed were reinforced. After the repairs, the carrying capacity of this section of road was increased, so crude oil from the Yumen Oil Mine can be smoothly transported by ten-ton oil tanker trucks to the railway line, and then transferred to refineries across the country. After the highway from Jiaoshui in Yongchang County, Gansu Province, to the Yaburai Salt Lake was completed, the salt that had been unsalable for many years in the Yaburai Salt Lake and the large quantities of furs produced by the herders of the Alxa League were also continuously transported out.

    我国公路建设去年有很大发展
    【新华社十五日讯】我国公路建设在一九五四年有很大发展。由中央投资修建和改建的公路有十八条，长四千三百多公里。由地方投资修建和改建的公路更多。
      一九五四年由中央投资新建的公路，大多在交通闭塞的少数民族聚居地区。其中比较重要的有康藏公路、青藏公路、海南岛主干公路；还有昆明通往佛海、成都通往阿坝和西宁通往玉树的公路等。这些公路都把少数民族地区的政治、经济、文化中心和货物集散地、城市紧密联系起来，对于发展少数民族的经济、文化生活有很大作用。青藏公路是以最快的速度修建的，在一九五四年一年内就修了一千二百多公里。它在拉萨和康藏公路碰头，沟通了青海、西藏、西康等省交通。昆明到佛海的公路，把云南西双版纳傣族自治区西部，和格朗、爱尼等族自治区的经济贸易中心的佛海和昆明联系起来。湘西武陵山区苗族人民多年就想望一条从洞庭湖滨常德通到自治区保靖的公路，这个愿望也在一九五四年内实现了。
    一九五四年内由地方投资新建和改建的公路很多。东北区新建和改建了公路工程十九项，使密如蛛网的东北公路交通运输能力更加提高了。一向交通不便的云贵高原，公路交通发展也很快。贵州省百分之七十的县和区都已有公路和贵阳市相通。甘肃新疆间公路由打柴沟到玉门油矿六百多公里地段内，在去年新建和加固了一百多座桥梁、涵洞，有几十处急弯陡坡改线，并加固了部分路基。这段路经过整修，载运能力提高，因此玉门油矿的原油就能利用载重十吨的大油罐卡车顺利地运送到铁路线上，然后再转运到各地炼油厂。甘肃省永昌县窖水通往雅布赖盐池的公路修通后，雅布赖盐池多年滞销的盐和阿拉善旗牧民所产的大宗皮毛也源源运出了。
