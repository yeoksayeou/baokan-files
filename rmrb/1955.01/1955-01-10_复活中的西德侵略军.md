The reconstruction of Hitler's "Wehrmacht" in West Germany and the Bonn authorities' conspiracies to finalize the ratification of the Paris Agreements are proceeding simultaneously.

According to the German News Agency, Adenauer discussed the issue of establishing a West German aggressor army as quickly as possible with his close colleagues on New Year's Eve. Adenauer intends to immediately hold talks with Bonn government officials and representatives of the parties participating in the government to eliminate any obstacles that may be encountered when the Paris Agreements undergo their second and third readings in the Bonn Federal Parliament. Once the third reading is complete, Adenauer intends to immediately force the Federal Parliament to pass the already prepared West German compulsory military service bill.

Meanwhile, according to the West German magazine "Der Spiegel," the Christian Democratic Union-Christian Social Union (Adenauer's party) parliamentary group is planning to establish a committee in the Bonn Federal Parliament specifically responsible for personnel matters, to select officers for the future West German aggressor army from former Nazi SS officers, primarily from those illegally released war criminals. Many former SS officers who committed brutal crimes during World War II have already been released from prison, with the most recent batch consisting of thirty-two high-ranking SS officers.

In addition, according to the Austrian "Arbeiter-Zeitung," the total number of militaristic organizations in West Germany and West Berlin led by former Hitler officers and Nazi party activists has reached as many as 732. All these organizations are unified under three major organizations: "German Soldiers' Association," "Kyffhäuser League," and "Steel Helmet." These organizations will provide the backbone for the new "Bundeswehr" to be established according to the Paris Agreements.

Preparations for supplying the new "Bundeswehr" with modern equipment are also underway. According to "American Aviation" magazine, there are currently twenty-six aircraft manufacturing plants in West Germany that are fully equipped. These plants have a total of 26,000 workers and can start producing aircraft immediately upon receiving an order. According to Reuters, West German aircraft factories have already started producing aircraft in Spain. It is reported that in Spain, the "Aircraft Joint Concern" composed of well-known German aircraft companies such as Dornier, Junkers, Focke-Wulf, Messerschmitt, and Heinkel has recently started manufacturing a "D.O. 25" aircraft.

Various military construction projects are also being carried out on a large scale in West Germany. According to a recent report in the West German "Rheinische Informationen," military airfields, barracks, ammunition and supply depots, tank repair factories, army hospitals, garages, and strategic highways are being built on a large scale in the Rhineland-Palatinate and parts of Hesse in West Germany. To this end, large tracts of forests, arable land, and pastures belonging to West German farmers have been confiscated.

    The "Diplomatic Storm" in London
      "Pravda" published a dispatch from its London correspondent, Olyehov: "Why did Bonn recall its chargé d'affaires from London?"

    The correspondent said that something had happened at the West German Embassy in London that many Britons could not help but ponder. According to newspaper reports, on the eve of Christmas, the West German chargé d'affaires, Herritell, entrusted his wife with delivering "traditional Christmas greetings" to the staff of the West German Embassy in the United Kingdom. The chargé d'affaires himself was unable to deliver the greetings in person due to attending a diplomatic banquet. Mrs. Herritell's greetings were learned by British journalists. In her greetings, she made some hostile attacks on Britain and repeated some of Hitler's slogans.

    According to "News Chronicle," Mrs. Herritell said: "My husband and I have repeatedly believed that London is very likely to be disloyal. We have repeatedly believed that we are living among enemies." According to "Daily Herald," "Daily Sketch," and "Daily Mail," Mrs. Herritell said: The staff of the West German Embassy in the United Kingdom live in enemy territory, live in an enemy country, and they cannot trust the British.

    Of course, none of this is surprising. "Daily Express" said that Herritell was not serving in a diplomatic capacity in London for the first time. When the war criminal Ribbentrop served as Hitler's German ambassador to the United Kingdom, Herritell had worked in that embassy.

    This incident at the West German Embassy in the United Kingdom alarmed some British newspapers because it reminded them of who Britain is now allied with in a military bloc, and what the true intentions of the Bonn Republic's rulers and their diplomats are. The newspapers are talking about this "diplomatic storm" and "tension in Anglo-German relations."

    Adenauer quickly recalled his diplomat from London. Of course, this does not change the essence of the matter. The London incident is a good illustration of the Paris and London Agreements, which stipulate the revival of West German militarism and the alliance between Britain and France and the Bonn revanchists.

    Mendès-France's Lies Exposed
    When the French National Assembly held a debate on ratifying the Paris Agreements, one of the arguments used by Mendès-France to alleviate the understandable fears of most members was the establishment of a so-called "European Armaments Agency" within the "Western European Union." Mendès-France insisted that this "agency" would be a "tool" for "effectively supervising" West German armament. He argued that this proposal was supported by Britain and the United States.

    However, as soon as the National Assembly debate ended, Parisian newspapers clamored in alarm because Britain and other countries, such as Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, were unwilling to participate in the "European Armaments Agency." These newspapers also pointed out that the U.S. government was unwilling to be bound by any definite obligations of the planned agency. Some Parisian newspapers uneasily pointed out that Britain and the United States were trying to push France into this "agency" while maintaining full freedom of action themselves.

    There is now a saying in Paris that, due to the above-mentioned attitude of Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, the meeting originally scheduled for January 17 to establish the "European Armaments Agency" will be postponed.

    It has also been pointed out in Paris that those likely to join the "European Armaments Agency" will not be the seven member states of the future "Western European Union," but only France, West Germany, and Italy.

    On January 5, "Combat" published an article on this development, emphasizing that the Pentagon is now mainly counting on the future West German army, because the West German army "will become the most important army under the jurisdiction of the Atlantic Treaty." Therefore, the United States does not want to establish any supervision over the armament of West Germany.

    How Washington Rudely Disdains France
    "Izvestia" published an article by M. Mikhailov entitled "How America Disdains France."

    Mikhailov revealed that only a few days after the United States forced the French National Assembly to formally pass the Paris Agreements, it became clear what "Atlantic solidarity" was all about. France is being despised by the United States, and this contempt is expressed in an unprecedentedly rude manner. France has been bluntly told that it has "no right" to be a great power and should willingly accept a subordinate position in the "Western European Union."

    This is the purpose and intention of the recently launched movement in the American press, which is obviously instigated. Commentators in the largest American newspapers, known for their close ties to the U.S. State Department and the Department of Defense, are repeating the old tune that France is an unreliable ally and that the time has come to no longer regard it as a great power. The role of America's main ally in Europe should be taken over by West Germany, and so on. News from the American press leads to the conclusion that Washington had long ago drawn up a plan to make France play a "second-rate role." The "New York Times" said in discussing this plan that the United States should consider the fact that France is no longer a first-rate power, and therefore, corresponding adjustments should be made in its treatment. The Washington "Star" pointed out that the United States and Britain will inevitably rely more on the future West German army and less on France.

    复活中的西德侵略军
    波恩加紧了重新武装的步骤
    西德的重建希特勒“国防军”工作和波恩当局为了最后完成巴黎协定的批准手续而进行的阴谋活动正在同时并进。
    据德意志通讯社报道，阿登纳在新年前夕和他的亲近的同僚讨论了尽快地建立一支西德侵略军的问题。阿登纳打算立即同波恩政府官员和参加政府的各党代表进行会谈，以消除巴黎协定在波恩联邦议院进行二读和三读的时候可能遇到的障碍。一等三读完成，阿登纳打算立即迫使联邦议院通过早已经准备好的西德义务兵役制法案。
    同时，据西德“明镜”周刊报道，基督教民主联盟—基督教社会联盟（阿登纳的党）议会党团正在策划在波恩联邦议院中设立一个专门负责人事问题的委员会，来从以前的纳粹党卫军军官中，首先是从被非法释放的战犯中，挑选未来的西德侵略军的军官。许多在二次大战中犯了残暴罪行的前党卫军军官早已从监狱中被释放了出来，最近一批被释放的党卫军高级军官有三十二名。
    此外，据奥地利“工人报”报道，目前，在西德和西柏林，由前希特勒的军官和纳粹党的活动分子领导的军国主义组织的总数已经达到七百三十二个之多，所有这些组织都分别统一在“德国军人联合会”、“基夫霍塞联合会”和“钢盔队”三个大组织中。这些组织将为未来按照巴黎协定建立的新“国防军”提供骨干。
    为新“国防军”供给现代化装备的准备工作也已经进行。据“美国航空”杂志报道，现在在西德境内有二十六个飞机制造工厂已经装备完毕，这些工厂共有工人二万六千人，只要一接到命令，就可以立即开始生产飞机。据路透社报道：西德的飞机工厂已经在西班牙开始生产飞机。有消息说：在西班牙，由道尼尔、容克、福克武夫、麦塞施米特和亨克尔等著名的德国飞机公司所组成的“飞机联合康采恩”最近已经开始制造一种“D·O·二十五型”飞机。
    在西德也正在大规模地进行各种军事建筑工程。据西德的“莱因信息报”最近的报道，在西德的莱因兰—帕拉丁耐特州的广大地区和黑森州的部分地区，正在大规模地建筑军用机场、兵营、弹药和供应品仓库、坦克修理厂、陆军医院、汽车库和战略公路，为此，没收了西德农民大片的森林地、可耕地和牧地。
    发生在伦敦的“外交风波”
      “真理报”刊载了它驻伦敦记者奥列霍夫的一篇通讯：“波恩为什么从伦敦召回它的代办？”
    记者说，西德驻伦敦的使馆发生了一件使许多英国人不能不深思的事情。据报纸消息，在圣诞节前夕，西德代办希里特尔委托他的夫人向西德驻英使馆的工作人员发表“传统的圣诞节祝词”。代办本人因为参加外交宴会，所以不能亲自发表祝词。希里特尔夫人的祝词为英国记者获知。她在祝词中对英国作了一些敌意的攻讦并且重复了希特勒的一些口号。
    据“新闻纪事报”说，希里特尔夫人说：“我的丈夫和我一再认为：伦敦非常可能背信。我们一再认为：我们是生活在敌人中间。”据“每日先驱报”、“每日简报”、“每日邮报”报道，希里特尔夫人说：西德驻英使馆的工作人员居住在敌人的领土上，居住在敌人的国家里，他们不可相信英国人。
    当然，这一切是没有什么奇怪的。“每日快报”说，希里特尔并不是第一次在伦敦担任外交职务。当战犯里宾特洛甫担任希特勒德国驻英大使时，希里特尔就曾在那个大使馆任职。
    西德驻英使馆发生的这件事引起了一些英国报纸的惊慌，因为这件事提醒它们：现在的英国是跟谁结成了军事集团，波恩共和国的执政者和代表他们的外交官的真正用心究竟何在。报刊都在谈论这场“外交风波”和“英德关系的紧张”。
    阿登纳赶快从伦敦召回了他的外交官。当然，这并不改变事情的实质。对于规定复活西德军国主义、规定英法同波恩复仇主义者结成联盟的巴黎和伦敦协定，伦敦的风波是一付很好的插图。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯的谎话揭穿了
    当法国国民议会举行批准巴黎协定的辩论的时候，孟戴斯—弗朗斯用来减轻大多数议员理所当然的疑惧的论据之一就是，在“西欧联盟”内建立一个所谓“欧洲军备机构”。孟戴斯—弗朗斯硬说：这个“机构”将是“有效监督”西德武装的“工具”。他的理由是，这个主张是得到英国和美国的支持的。
    但是，国民议会的辩论刚一结束，巴黎的报纸就由于英国以及比利时、荷兰、卢森堡等国不愿意参加“欧洲军备机构”而惊慌地叫嚷了。这些报纸还指出美国政府不愿意受到筹划中的这个机构的任何确定的义务的束缚。某些巴黎报纸不安地指出：英国和美国企图把法国推入这个“机构”，同时自己却保持着充分的行动自由。
    现在巴黎有这样一种说法：由于英国、比利时、荷兰和卢森堡抱着上述的态度，有关国家原定在一月十七日举行建立“欧洲军备机构”的会议将要延期召开。
    巴黎还有人指出：可能加入“欧洲军备机构”的将不是未来“西欧联盟”的七个会员国，而只是法国、西德和意大利。
    一月五日“战斗报”就这种事态发展发表文章着重指出：五角大楼现在主要指望的已经是未来的西德军队，因为西德军队“将成为大西洋公约管辖之下的最主要的陆军”。因此，美国不希望对武装西德建立任何监督。
    华盛顿怎样粗暴地藐视法国
    “消息报”刊载了麦·米哈伊洛夫的一篇文章，题为“美国怎样藐视法国”。
    米哈伊洛夫揭露：美国逼使法国国民议会正式通过巴黎协定才没有几天，“大西洋的团结”是怎么回事已经可以看出来了。法国受到美国的藐视，而这种藐视表现的方式是空前粗暴的。法国被直率地告诉说，它“无权”当一个大国，它应该在“西欧联盟”中自甘屈居从属的地位。
    这就是美国报纸最近发动的显然有人授意的运动的目的和用意。那些以接近美国国务院和国防部著称的美国最大的报纸的评论员在重弹着老调，说法国是一个不可靠的盟国，现在已经到了不再把它当作大国看待的时候了，美国在欧洲的主要盟国的角色应该由西德来担当等等。美国报纸的消息使人们可以这样推论：华盛顿老早就把让法国充当“二等角色”的计划拟订好了。“纽约时报”谈到这个计划时说：美国应该考虑法国不再是头等大国这一事实，因此，在待遇上应该作相应的调整。华盛顿“明星报”指出：美国和英国不可避免地要更多地依靠将来的西德军队，而较少地依靠法国。
