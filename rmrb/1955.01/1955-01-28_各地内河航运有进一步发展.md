Inland river transportation in various regions across the country overfulfilled the state plan last year. According to statistics from thirteen provinces, including Liaoning, Jilin, Hebei, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Guangdong, and Guangxi, by the end of last year, the volume of freight reached 113% of the annual plan, and the freight turnover reached 107.73% of the annual plan.

Last year, the transportation efficiency of inland river steamers in various provinces improved. For example, the unit output of passenger and freight steamers in Jiangsu Province increased by 23.75% compared to 1953; the operating horsepower productivity of tugboats in Hunan Province averaged 360 ton-kilometers per day, an increase of 67% compared to 1953. Due to improvements in port operations, the sailing time of steamers has also been shortened. For example, the Yidu steamer in Hubei Province has halved the round-trip time between Hankou and Shayang compared to the past. The round trip of tugboats from Hankou to Yichang in Hubei Province originally took 25 days, but has been shortened to 12 days after improvements in port operations.

Last year, various provinces opened up many new routes. For example, Sichuan Province opened the Lueyang River route, facilitating the transportation of engineering materials for the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. Hunan Province newly opened routes such as Changsha to Yichang, Changsha to Chenxi, and Changde to Wuchang, which also greatly facilitated the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. Inland river freight rates in Fujian, Guangxi, Jiangsu, Hunan, and other provinces have been reduced to varying degrees. Last year, they were reduced by 7% to 40% compared to 1953. The freight rates of wooden sailboats in Sichuan, Guangxi, Hubei, Guangdong, and other provinces have also been reduced by 10% to 48.67%.

Nationwide, 83% of the private shipping tonnage in local inland river private shipping has been incorporated into joint public-private ownership. The wooden sailboats in various provinces have been strengthened in organizational management through administrative measures such as unified scheduling, unified sources of goods, and unified freight rates, and have been organized. Last year, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Henan, Hunan, Zhejiang, and other provinces organized five wooden sailboat transportation cooperatives, 320 wooden sailboat transportation teams, and 4,331 wooden sailboat transportation groups. Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, and other provinces have combined a total of 100,000 tons of wooden sailboats with modernized steamers for towing transportation.

    各地内河航运有进一步发展
    去年全国地方内河货物运输超额完成了国家计划。根据辽宁、吉林、河北、江苏、安徽、浙江、福建、湖北、湖南、江西、四川、广东、广西等十三个省的统计，到去年底，货运量达到年计划的百分之一百一十三，货运周转量达到年计划的百分之一百零七点七三。
    去年各省内河轮舶运输效率都有提高。如江苏省的客货轮单位生产量比一九五三年提高了百分之二十三点七五；湖南省的拖轮营运马力夫生产量，平均每日达到三百六十吨公里，较一九五三年提高了百分之六十七。由于港口作业有了改进，也缩短了轮舶的航行时间。如湖北省的宜都轮，在汉口至沙洋的往返航程上比过去缩短了一半的时间。湖北省拖轮由汉口至宜昌的航程，原来往返一次需二十五天，在港口作业改进以后，已缩短为十二天。
    各省去年开辟了不少航线。如四川省开辟了略阳河航线，便利了宝成铁路的工程物料运输。湖南省新辟了长沙至宜昌、长沙至辰溪、常德至武昌等航线，也大大地便利了城乡物资的交流。福建、广西、江苏、湖南等省的内河航运运价已有不同程度的降低。去年已比一九五三年降低了百分之七至百分之四十。四川、广西、湖北、广东等省的木帆船运价也已降低了百分之十至百分之四十八点六七。
    全国地方内河私营航业中，已有百分之八十三的私营船舶载重吨纳入了公私合营。各省木帆船都已通过统一调度、统一货源、统一运价等行政措施，加强了组织管理，并已组织起来。江西、江苏、河南、湖南、浙江等省，去年已组织了五个木帆船运输合作社，三百二十个木帆船运输队，四千三百三十一个木帆船运输组。江西、浙江、江苏、安徽等省已共有十万吨木帆船和近代化的轮舶结合起来进行拖带运输。
