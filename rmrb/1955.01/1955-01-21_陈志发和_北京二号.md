    Chen Zhifa and the "Beijing No. 2"
    Wan Tian, Junjie
    The "Beijing No. 2" train ferry, manufactured by the Jiangnan Shipyard, entered the dock on the day before National Day in 1954. While others were enjoying the holidays, attending cultural evenings, watching plays, dancing… Chen Zhifa, from the Hull Workshop No. 2, stayed at home worrying. This was because the ferry had a long hull and shallow draft. To ensure product quality, the workers adopted a method of building the ship's body in two sections, front and rear, on the slipway. After launching each section separately they were moved into the dock, and the two sections joined together. (There was also a small 13-meter section between the front and rear sections, used to connect the front and rear). Chen Zhifa further put forward a specific suggestion: after the ship enters the dock, don't pump out the water first; install the side panels and a row of decks above the waterline on both sides. In this way, the front and rear sections could be aligned accurately and joined firmly. This would only require pumping the water out once, saving time, manpower, and materials, and ensuring quality. The suggestion was good, but the method of erecting scaffolding on the water was not solved. Chen Zhifa brought the problem back to the production team for discussion. Some said: there's no way to build scaffolding; let's just do it the way it was planned. Others advocated not rushing, and for everyone to think calmly. Chen Zhifa was never willing to give up: the Party branch had issued a call for this, and he had also made a guarantee at the Party group meeting that he would never bow to difficulties!
    On October 2nd, Chen Zhifa was on duty at the factory. The factory was quiet during the holiday, without a sound. The sound of the Huangpu River lapping against the shore could be heard from afar. Chen Zhifa walked back and forth along the side of the dock, hands behind his back, deep in thought.
    "Scaffolding, scaffolding! Is it impossible to build this ship without you? Oh! If only there was a way without scaffolding." As he walked, he thought, strolling to the shipyard. New ships were arranged on the slipway, some with parts of steel plates welded with angle iron (called ribs, like human ribs) that had not yet been hoisted onto the ship. Suddenly, an idea flashed in his mind.
    "First assemble the middle 13-meter section on land, as a component. Hoist it up with a crane, and what need is there for any scaffolding?!" He stood there blankly for a long while, feeling that the more he thought about it, the more sense it made, the more satisfied he became.
    As soon as work started, he announced this idea in the group. The team members were so happy when they heard it that they jumped for joy.
    Everyone carried the materials to the side of the dock and began assembly.
    The supervising engineer arrived. Chen Zhifa gestured and explained the method to him. As he listened, he kept nodding and saying, "Hmm! Hmm!" When he finished, he clapped his hands and said, "Wonderful! A great idea!"
    The engineer then suggested: Pull two steel cables across the first two sections in a criss-cross pattern, and the two sections will be even more stable.
    Labor and technology met here in victory!
    This ferry successfully transported sixteen freight trains from Wuchang to Hankou for the first time on December 9th of last year, and began to take on the task of being a "mobile bridge."

    陈志发和“北京二号”
    万田　俊杰
    江南造船厂制造的“北京二号”火车大渡轮是在一九五四年国庆节前一天进坞的。别人在节日里，参加文娱晚会，看戏，跳舞……过得欢乐愉快，只有船体第二车间陈志发却呆在家里想心事。这是因为这只渡船船身长，吃水浅，为了保证产品质量，工人们采用了先在船台上分前后二段建造，分别下水后再进入船坞，把二段连接起来的方法（前后两段之间还有十三公尺的一小段，用这一小段使前后连接起来）。陈志发更提出了一个具体的意见：船进坞后先不要抽水，把两边水面以上的傍板和一行甲板装起来，前后二段就可以对得准，接得牢，这样放一次水就行了，时间和人力物力都可以节约，质量又可以保证。这意见好是好，就是在水上搭工作架子的办法没解决。陈志发又把这问题带回生产小组去研究，有人说：没办法搭工作架子，还是照上面的办法做吧，也有人主张不要着急，大家都冷静的想想。陈志发总是不甘心：党支部为这事提出过号召，自己也在党小组会上做过保证，决不能向困难低头！
    十月二日陈志发在厂里值班，假日里的工厂，静悄悄地没有一点声息，黄浦江水拍打砥岸的声音，老远就能听到。陈志发倒背着双手，在船坞边上静静地踱着。
    “工作架，工作架！难道离了你，这条船就造不成吗？哦！有个不用工作架的办法就好了。”他一面走，一面想，信步走到了造船场，一条一条的新船摆在船台上，有的钢板上焊着角铁（这叫做肋骨，就像人的肋条一样）的部件，还没有吊到船上去，突然一个想法在他的脑子里一晃。
    “先在陆上把当中十三公尺的一段，当做部件装配起来，用吊车往上一吊，还用得着什么工作架子呢！？”他呆呆的站在那里好一回，越想越有道理，越想越得意。
    一上工，他就把这个想法在小组里宣布了，组员们一听，高兴得乱蹦乱跳。
    大家一起把材料扛到船坞边上来，开始装配了。
    监造工程师来了，陈志发比比划划的把这办法讲给他听，他在听的时候，不住“嗯！嗯！”的点头，完了把手一拍：“妙呀！好办法！”
    工程师又建议：把前二段交叉着拉上二条钢索，二段就更固定了。
    劳动和技术在这里胜利的会师了！
    这只渡轮已于去年十二月九日第一次把十六辆载货列车从武昌运到汉口，开始负起“活动桥梁”的任务。
