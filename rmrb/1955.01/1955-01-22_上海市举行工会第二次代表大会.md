    Shanghai Holds Second Congress of Trade Unions

    The Second Congress of Shanghai Trade Unions was held from January 10th to 17th. The congress had 1,460 official delegates, representing 18 industrial trade unions and over 1,329,000 trade union members in Shanghai.

    The congress unanimously adopted the report on "The Basic Situation and Future Tasks of Shanghai Trade Unions' Work in the Past Five Years." The report stated that since the First Workers' Representative Congress in February 1950, the city's trade union organizations have achieved great accomplishments in various tasks. Through organizing labor competitions, labor productivity has been greatly improved, effectively guaranteeing the completion of the state's production plans. The majority of technical workers in major industries have mastered or begun to master advanced operating methods, and more than 30 major Soviet advanced operating methods have been promoted. From January to August last year, employees in 11 industrial systems, including machinery, light industry, and textile industry, put forward and had adopted more than 17,000 rationalization proposals. In 1953 and 1954, more than 1,000 major new products were successfully manufactured. The city has produced more than 200 model workers such as Zhu Shunyu, Yi Shijuan, and Ji Haoran, and more than 20,000 advanced workers. In recent years, more than 50,000 workers, technicians, and cadres have participated in construction work throughout the country. The material and cultural life of employees has been greatly improved. The working class has continued to grow, and from February 1950 to June last year, trade union membership increased from 800,000 to more than 1,329,000. The report also pointed out the existing shortcomings in the current trade union work and put forward the basic tasks for Shanghai's trade union work in the future.

    During the discussion process at the congress, the delegates criticized and self-criticized the bureaucratic, subjectivist, and formalistic work styles existing in the current Shanghai trade union work, and the phenomenon of trade union organizations being divorced from the masses.

    Ke Qingshi, Secretary of the Shanghai Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC, delivered a political report to the congress. The report analyzed the current situation in Shanghai, pointing out that Shanghai is one of China's original industrial bases, located on the front line of national defense, and that capitalist economic components still occupy a large proportion. The Shanghai working class has a great responsibility in realizing the country's first Five-Year Plan and supporting the struggle to liberate Taiwan. He called on the Shanghai working class to unite, heighten vigilance, overcome difficulties, actively lead and promote the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and gradually improve and transform production technology and management to the advanced level of socialism.

    The congress approved changing the name of the Shanghai General Trade Union to the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, and elected Chen Pixian, Zhong Min, Zhang Qi, Shen Han, Tang Guifen, Ma Xiaodi, Ji Haoran, Sheng Li and other eighty-seven people as members and alternate members of the Second Committee of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions.

    The congress also passed congratulatory telegrams to Chairman Mao, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Chinese People's Volunteers, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.
