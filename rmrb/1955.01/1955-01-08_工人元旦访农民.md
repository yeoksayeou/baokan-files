    Workers Visit Peasants on New Year's Day
    On New Year's Day morning, it was drizzling and snowing. The workers of the Lu Agou Group from the State-owned Shanghai No. 2 Textile Machinery Factory, full of joy, rushed from their homes to the ferry at the Huangpu River, busy meeting their peasant brothers at the Tongxin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Tangyan Township, Yangsi District, Pudong.
    On this day, a banner reading "Welcome Worker Elder Brothers" was hung in the reception room of the Tongxin Agricultural Production Cooperative. Cooperative member Lu Jinbao wiped every bench with a towel; in the vegetable garden, female cooperative member Yan Jinzhu was picking tender and delicious pea seedlings, preparing to entertain the worker elder brothers; the young girls had practiced three dances overnight, and the children with gongs and drums ran out of the house time and time again, looking for the visitors on the road.
    At half past eleven, the workers of the Lu Agou Group arrived at the cooperative, treading on the muddy dirt road. They brought twenty-two New Year's pictures, including "We Must Liberate Taiwan," and forty-four comic books as gifts for the peasants. The cooperative members welcomed the workers into the reception room, set out bowls and chopsticks, and invited the workers to taste the things they had grown with their own hands. The brothers had endless things to say to each other, sharing good news. Cooperative member Lu Genfa said:
  "Since we established the cooperative last spring, the number of peasant households joining has increased from eight to forty-eight, and the cooperative also has water pumps and double-furrow plows." Ying Zhongfa, the leader of the Lu Agou Group's trade union group, told the peasants that their factory had completed the annual state plan four days ahead of schedule last year.
    At the discussion, the two sides encouraged each other to take practical actions to increase production to crush the US-Chiang treaty and support the struggle to liberate Taiwan. The peasants guaranteed to eliminate more than 30 mu of vacant land, and the workers guaranteed to fully exceed the January production plan.

    工人元旦访农民
    元旦的早晨，天空中飘着细雨和雪花。国营上海第二纺织机械厂陆阿狗小组的工人们，喜冲冲地各自从家里赶向黄浦江边的渡口，他们忙着到浦东杨思区塘严乡同心农业生产合作社去会见农民兄弟。
    这天，同心农业生产合作社客堂上挂起了“欢迎工人老大哥”的横幅，社员陆金宝用毛巾揩抹着每一条板凳；在菜地里，女社员严金珠正在挑拣嫩美的豌豆苗，准备招待工人老大哥；年轻的姑娘们已连夜练好了三个舞蹈，拿锣背鼓的孩子们一次又一次跑出屋子，去探望公路上的来人。
    十一时半，陆阿狗小组的工人们，踏着泥泞的黄土路来到了合作社。他们带来了“一定要解放台湾”等二十二张新年画和四十四本连环图画，作为送给农民的礼物。社员们把工人接进客堂，摆开碗筷，请工人尝尝他们亲手种出来的东西。兄弟见面有话说不完，他们相互报喜讯。社员陆根法说：
  “我们从去年春天建社后，入社的农民，从八户扩大到四十八户了，社里还有了抽水机和双铧犁。”陆阿狗小组工会小组长应忠发告诉农民，去年他们厂里提前四天完成了全年国家计划。
    在座谈会上，双方相互鼓励着要以增加生产的实际行动来粉碎美蒋条约，支援解放台湾的斗争。农民们保证要消灭三十多亩空白地，工人们保证要全面超额完成一月份生产计划。
