    Visitors are touring the first exhibition room of the exhibition. On display here are many U.S.-made heavy machine guns, 60 mortars, submachine guns, various rifles and pistols, transceivers, walkie-talkies, telegraph codes, navigation platforms for contacting aircraft or giving target indications, instruments of assassination, forged documents, and other physical evidence brought by airborne spies.

    Visitors view the many parachutes hanging at the entrance of the exhibition. These are a portion of the parachutes seized from U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek bandits' airborne spies.

    The "Exhibition of Evidence of U.S. Airborne Espionage" organized by the Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China (at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace) is divided into three exhibition rooms, displaying more than 15,000 pieces of evidence of U.S. airborne espionage. This evidence exposes the criminal acts of U.S. aggressors in air-dropping spies into our country. This is the "Distribution Map of U.S. Airborne Espionage Activities in China" hanging in the first exhibition room of the exhibition.　Photos in this issue of the pictorial are taken by our reporters Yuan Yiping and Wang Zhiyuan, unless otherwise credited.

    The U.S.-made map of Antu County, Jilin Province, Northeast China, carried by U.S. spies Downey and Fecteau. The straight line and arrow in the lower right corner of the map are original. The arrow points to the Laoling Mountains, where Downey and Fecteau attempted to use an aerial retrieval device to extract U.S. spy Li Junying.　Xinhua News Agency

    A photograph displayed in the second exhibition room: Residents near Wulong District, Andong City, gather around the wreckage of the B-29 aircraft used by U.S. spies Arnold and others.

    The second exhibition room displays evidence from two major espionage cases involving U.S. spies John Thomas Downey and John Knox Arnold. This is a photograph from the Downey case evidence section: Downey and Fecteau being captured by our forces after parachuting to the ground when their plane was shot down.

    These are the forged passes and telegram drafts used by the spies.

    These are the U.S.-made Thompson submachine gun and bullets carried by U.S. spy Arnold and others.

    These are fragments of maps and other relevant documents carried by U.S. spies Downey and Arnold.

    Visitors are viewing the ground portion of the aerial retrieval device that U.S. spies Downey and Fecteau attempted to use to extract spy Li Junying. The aerial retrieval device includes sixteen sections of aluminum tubes that can be assembled into two poles, nylon ropes, and a grass-green cloth basket-like device. The six photos affixed to the wooden board illustrate how to use the aerial retrieval device. U.S. intelligence agencies packed these items in a rectangular cloth box and airdropped it to ground spy Li Junying. Leaning against the wooden board is the metal pulley from the aircraft.　Xinhua News Agency reporter Qi Guanshan

    Visitors are touring the third exhibition room of the exhibition. This exhibition room displays evidence from the airborne espionage cases of Chinese spies Li Guangyuan, Wang Hecan, Wang Bu, Chen Xiang, Ma Xincan, etc., who were trained by U.S. intelligence agencies.

    These are two aircraft wrecks on display at the exhibition. The one in front is the wreckage of the U.S.-made B-29 aircraft used by U.S. spy Arnold and others, and the one behind is the wreckage of the U.S.-made C-47 spy plane used by U.S. spy Downey and others.
