    Enterprise Party Organizations Should Strive to Improve Product Quality
    By Our Reporter An Gang
    Improving product quality has significant political and economic importance. Party organizations must treat this issue with a serious attitude. If any factory fails to produce high-quality and qualified products according to national requirements, it will inevitably fail to complete the national production plan by variety, thereby causing losses to the country and hindering national construction and the accumulation of national funds.
    Many factory Party organizations have long neglected the work of improving product quality. They do not understand that improving product quality is a major struggle between advanced and backward thinking. Some people regard improving product quality as a purely technical issue and entrust it only to a few technical personnel and inspectors. This approach is of course wrong. Party organizations must constantly conduct ideological education on improving product quality for all employees, and fully utilize technical forces and inspection agencies to ensure the implementation of every technical organizational measure and the implementation of technical operating procedures. Why should this be done? Because the important task of the Party organization in an enterprise is not only to ensure that the enterprise completes the total output value plan, but also to ensure the production plan of all product varieties according to the national plan, and to strive to continuously improve product quality, find out all the reasons that hinder the normal production of the factory, and eliminate them completely. This principle is well known. However, the Party organizations in many enterprises often fail to fully implement it. Some even oppose the completion of production tasks and the guarantee of product quality. They go to the workshops every day to "urge parts," thinking that getting the parts out can at least guarantee the completion of the output value plan. They only promote to the employees how much value of products should be produced; but rarely promote to the employees what kind of products should be dedicated to the country, and how to produce to ensure the comprehensive completion of the national plan. The mobilization of the masses to strive for improving product quality has been neglected. This propaganda method is of course one-sided.
    In any case, the Party's propaganda work must not oppose quantity and quality. Paying attention to product quantity and quality is an important part of the Party's ideological work in enterprises.
    In order to ensure the improvement of product quality, the Party organization should always pay attention to uniting the employees' vigorous production enthusiasm with the skilled mastery of technology, and mobilize the employees to produce both the necessary quantity of products and highly quality products.
    Why is the product quality of some factories poor, and how can this problem be overcome? The following situations are worth noting and referencing.
      One situation is: Some factories produce a large number of substandard products and waste products, but the Party organization does not care about them, which affects production for a long time. Why doesn't the Party organization care? The main reason is that they have not gone deep into the workers to comprehensively analyze and study the reasons for the poor product quality. They hold a helpless attitude of "not understanding science and technology, unable to manage." For example, in the work of sand casting, a factory in Dalian achieved a 100% yield of finished products with the help of Soviet experts, and the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory also reduced waste products to a very small number with the help of Soviet experts. However, it is understood that some factories with sand casting workshops or sand casting sections have set high waste rates. The actual waste rate of sand casting in some factories is as high as 80%. Why doesn't the Party organization fight against this phenomenon? The reason is that some comrades have ignored a basic fact: waste products and substandard products do not occur naturally, but are caused by people; since they are caused by people, they can certainly be eliminated by people. When Party workers go to the site, some people may attribute the causes of substandard products and waste products to objective difficulties such as weather, raw materials, and tools. Party workers should tell them: "There are difficulties, but the task entrusted to us by the country is to overcome the difficulties," "Human efforts will definitely reduce the difficulties to the minimum." The production conditions and technical operating methods of sand casting workshops are not very different in many factories. Why can a 100% yield of finished products be achieved with the help of Soviet experts? The reason lies in: First, they resolutely oppose the idealistic idea of "waste products are inevitable," and do not admit that there is any irresistible law of generating waste products. They firmly believe that "people will definitely conquer nature," and established the idea of consciously and resolutely fighting against waste products among the masses. Second, they improved the working environment, promoted civilized production, adopted a strict inspection system for products, and launched mass inspection and supervision work to ensure quality. Third, they improved labor organization, rationally organized the technical operation process, and took all measures to eliminate the weak links in production. These practices greatly exerted people's subjective initiative, thereby ensuring the improvement of product quality. These practices do not involve any profound technology, but are a serious ideological and organizational work. In a factory in Shenyang, workers often damaged tools in production, which affected product quality, but some people thought this was "unavoidable." The factory's Party organization and propagandists disagreed with this view. They and the production group leaders summoned the workers to analyze the fact that the group wasted more than 100 tools every day, which was equivalent to 3 million yuan in RMB, and would waste more than 1 billion yuan for the country in a year, which shocked everyone. Then, the propagandists promoted to the workers the difficulty of the source of tools, explaining that "manufacturing a tool requires more than 30 processes and costs a lot of workers' brothers' sweat. Manufacturing a measuring tool requires an eighth-grade fitter to work for more than a month. We cannot waste the sweat of the workers' brothers for nothing." The Party's propagandists also found advanced people and model deeds who have always cherished tools from among the workers, and carried out publicity, which finally changed the masses' understanding. They said: "In the past, I always thought that it didn't matter to damage some tools in such a large factory. I didn't expect that this would affect the country's socialist construction." Since then, things that were considered "inevitable" in the past have finally been eliminated.
    One situation is: Some people often push the responsibility for not completing product quality indicators to the higher authorities, saying that "the higher authorities' requirements for quality are too high, and the workers cannot keep up." The actual situation is not entirely like this. According to the understanding of units such as the Shenyang Air Compressor Factory, the main reason for the poor product quality is not that the higher authorities' requirements are high, but that many employees do not understand why it is necessary to improve product quality according to national requirements. Therefore, the Party's propaganda departments must first correctly publicize the political and economic significance of improving product quality. According to the materials of the Propaganda Department of the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee, the electrolytic zinc produced by the Shenyang Smelter often fails to meet the requirements of "four nines" (containing 99.99% pure zinc). Comrade Xue Baotai, the chief engineer of the neutralization section of the zinc electrolysis workshop of this factory, is a Party propagandist. He took the initiative to serve as the explainer at the quality exhibition held by the Party branch. Xue Baotai's propaganda method is worth learning. He said: "We know that zinc is the raw material for alloys. Zinc has many characteristics that other metals do not have. The main ones are: no thermal expansion and cold contraction, and no rust.
  Zinc with 'three nines' has the largest and widest use, from various machines used in industrial production to trains, automobiles, ships, tracks, and even iron buckets used in our daily production must have zinc. The bearings of machines can ensure the precision of the machine with zinc; without zinc, the machine will not run normally, and the parts that are machined will not be regular. Zinc with 'four nines' has even greater use. For example, a machine can originally be used for ten years. If the bearings have zinc with 'four nines', it can be used for fifteen to twenty years." Xue Baotai also talked about the use of zinc in national defense construction. He said: "When soldiers charge into battle, if the gun jams, it won't even work as a fire stick! To ensure that the gun does not jam, the cartridge case must use zinc with 'four nines'. Everyone, think about how important our work is." After Xue Baotai said this, everyone was motivated, and the workers said that they had "opened their minds" and that "if they don't pay attention to quality, it will affect national construction." Then, Xue Baotai convened a technical research meeting in the neutralization section to find ways to improve quality, and encouraged everyone to expose the problems existing in the section. Some workers exposed "arsenic and antimony not being removed before putting liquid into the purified liquid section," and some exposed "putting mixed liquid into the purified liquid section," and other seven or eight facts. The conclusion of the discussion was that the main reason why the product quality did not meet the standard was that the operating procedures were not followed in the operation. The meeting formulated a system for implementing the operating procedures based on these situations. After the meeting, Comrade Xue Baotai also worked on individual backward workers. After such propaganda and organizational work in the neutralization section, everyone was universally mobilized, and the quality of zinc in the products rose from "three nines" to "four nines." Recently, the national indicators were exceeded, reaching 99.991%.
    Some people attribute the poor product quality only to the low technical level of the workers, but they have not actively carried out education to improve the skills of the employees, nor have they strictly required the employees to abide by the technical operating procedures. Some factories continue to add new workers, but they have not paid attention to combining production with education on operating procedures and technical safety regulations. Some factories in Benxi and Shenyang have now begun to pay attention to summarizing the experience of typical figures who have consistently followed technical operating procedures and have not had any accidents. Wang Hengcheng, a coal miner in Benxi Coal Mine, has not violated technical operating procedures or had any accidents in the past five years; by the end of October last year, he had completed 19 months of coal mining quotas. He and his apprentice Zhang Xiuhai proposed: "Guarantee to complete two years of coal mining quotas within this year (1954)." Zhao Baifu, a roasting furnace worker in Shenyang Smelter, has not violated various rules and regulations in the past six years; Zhang Chengliang, a reverberatory furnace worker, has been producing safely for 1,560 consecutive days without any accidents. These people who have been actively working year after year are glorious examples in the working class. Party organizations must not let their advanced deeds go unnoticed. Benxi and Shenyang discovered these advanced figures in a timely manner and launched extensive publicity, and used the deeds of these advanced figures to advocate a spirit of persevering in production, and establish a righteous atmosphere of diligently engaging in production, to influence and educate the masses. This is an important method of leading production to improve product quality.
    Another reason why factory employees cannot well comply with the technical operating procedures is that the employees do not understand why the product inspection system should be implemented. They regard the work of the inspectors as "finding fault," so they do not comply with the inspection system. Facts have proved that where the Party's leadership in a factory is weak and the mass work has no foundation, the product quality there is not good, and the operating workers and the inspection personnel are at odds. How does the Party organization solve this conflict? Some factories have adopted a laissez-faire attitude, thinking that "everyone has their own reasons for technical issues"; some places have seized both sides to talk to them individually to solve the relationship between the two sides. In fact, the key to the problem is that the Party organization has not established the principle of producing and inspecting according to the national unified quality standards among the production workers and inspection personnel. Only when ideological understanding is unified can unity in production be achieved. In the No. 3 workshop of the 53 Factory, there was a period of time when the inspection caused a lot of downtime in production. Some operating workers did not have enough understanding of the inspection work, and looked down on the inspection workers. They deliberately took good products for the inspection workers to inspect in order to make fun of the inspection personnel. Later, the workshop propagandist explained to the employees: "The inspector's serious inspection of quality is a manifestation of loyalty to their duties and responsibility to the country and the people. It is not to find fault with anyone." He proposed that "everyone should take the initiative to accept inspection. Negative confrontation is wrong." On the other hand, he also promoted among the inspection personnel the important significance of actively uniting production workers, improving product quality, reducing the number of stops, and catching up with the daily progress to ensure the completion of the national plan. After the publicity, the workers reflected: "In the past, it was because of our own low awareness. We didn't understand that strict quality inspection is being responsible to the country. We always thought that the inspection personnel were making things difficult for us." Some inspection personnel also checked their own problems of not being calm and one-sided in handling problems. On the basis of the consensus of the Party organization, the production workers and inspection workers were mobilized to sign a contact contract. In the contract, both parties stipulated "obeying inspection" and "discussing things with each other" and other systems. Afterwards, individual people who did not pay attention to product quality were individually educated. For example, if it was found that individual workers still did not pay attention to checking product quality, the propagandist would remind him during production: "Don't forget to check. Not producing waste products is increasing the strength to liberate Taiwan!" After the workshop propagandist carried out the above-mentioned publicity activities, the product quality of the group was significantly improved, the waste products were reduced to two-thirds of the original quantity, and the rework products were reduced from 10% to 1.5%.
    One situation is: Some Party organizations adopt a conciliatory attitude towards the phenomenon of some employees manufacturing substandard products and failing to produce according to the national variety plan, thinking that: "Improving quality should be done slowly. It's good enough now than in the past." This seems to say that things will slowly get better by themselves, and "there's nothing we can do to rush it." Therefore, they turn a blind eye to a large number of waste products and rework products. According to the situation of many factories, poor product quality is often due to the fact that employees cannot combine their daily labor with the comprehensive completion of the national plan, and cannot treat their labor from the overall interests of the country, thus forming a phenomenon of pursuing product quantity, reducing product quality, and manufacturing waste products. The reason for the emergence of these phenomena is that some backward ideas among the workers have not been resolved for a long time. For example, some people think: "It doesn't matter if the quality is a little bit worse. It's a good thing to exceed the quantity target!" A few people think: "Earning two more piece rates (referring to piece-rate wages) is a serious matter. Why bother with the quality and cost?" Others said: "The machines and equipment are too old. Only replacing them with new machines can solve the problem." After some local Party organizations discovered these problems, they only carried out general propaganda, saying that pursuing "piece rates" is "economism" and that "producing waste products is helping the enemy." This kind of propaganda with big labels has little effect. We should not use sayings such as "basically good, but the problem is serious" to
  "comfort" the employees, and at the same time, we should not be satisfied with talking about general principles and making
  some empty criticisms. The Party organization should seriously and publicly point out the shortcomings, investigate the responsibility, and criticize the manufacturers of substandard products and waste products. And support the administration to take appropriate actions against these people. At the same time, Party organizations and propagandists should often talk to the masses about the topic of "What impact will poor product quality have on the country?" Use concrete facts to point out that producing products with poor quality or failing to produce according to the variety is actually an act of harming national interests, and will affect the country's socialist construction to a certain extent. For example, in the third quarter of 1954, Liaoning Province did not complete the production task of special steel, which affected the production and project progress of 405 units. The Liaoning Provincial Bureau of Statistics made a concrete analysis of the impact of poor product quality on national construction in the third quarter of the province. This method is worth learning. Their analysis of the impact of poor product quality has the following points: First, it caused a large backlog of products, resulting in a serious disconnect between supply, production, and sales. At the end of the third quarter, Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory had accumulated national funds of 41 billion yuan due to unqualified product quality. A part of the transformers in the inventory of Shenyang Transformer Factory had accumulated funds of 39.6 billion yuan due to unqualified quality specifications. Second, it seriously affected the urgent needs of various ordering units. The poor quality of low-voltage switches in Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory affected the production of units such as Shanghai Huatong Switch Factory. The switches ordered from them by a certain oil factory burned the insulation tube due to the low design capacity, and production was stopped for four days. Third, a large number of waste products were manufactured. In the third quarter alone, the parts waste products caused by production workers violating operating procedures in the high-voltage switch factory reached 7,471 pieces. Fourth, it reduced the profits turned over to the state. The quality of the paint produced by Shenyang Grease Chemical Factory was low and difficult to sell, which affected the decline in profits turned over. In 1952, the factory turned over 39 billion yuan in profits, in 1953 it was 6.2 billion yuan, and in 1954 it was planned to reduce it to 5.8 billion yuan. In fact, from January to August, it had already lost 1 billion yuan. If the Party's propaganda work can carefully analyze the various impacts caused by poor product quality, find out the reasons subjectively and the strength to overcome difficulties, and break various "laissez-faire" ideas, it will definitely be able to inspire the masses to improve product quality.
    The above situations show that improving product quality should be the Party organization's regular ideological work, which is one of the components of mobilizing and organizing all employees to ensure the comprehensive completion of the national plan. Improving product quality depends on technology in many ways, but life tells us that only under the correct leadership of the Party, starting from solving ideological problems and establishing correct thinking, can the role of technology be better played; only thorough and meticulous ideological work can mobilize and organize employees to strive for mastering technology and improving product quality.

    企业党组织应当为提高产品质量而斗争
    本报记者　安岗
    提高产品质量有着重大的政治意义和经济意义。党组织必须用严肃的态度对待这个问题。任何
  一个工厂如果不能按照国家的要求生产优等质量的和合格的产品，必然不能作到按品种来完成国家生产计划，因而也就会给国家带来损失，就会妨害国家建设工作和国家资金的积累。
    有不少工厂中的党组织长期忽视提高产品质量的工作。他们不了解：提高产品质量是先进思想同落后思想的重大的斗争。有人把提高产品质量看作是单纯的技术问题，只委托给少数技术人员和检查人员去作。这种作法当然是错误的。党组织必须经常不断地向全体职工进行提高产品质量的思想教育，充分运用技术力量和检查机构来保证每一个技术组织措施的实现和技术操作规程的贯彻执行。为什么要这样作呢？因为党组织在企业中的重要任务，不仅要保证这一企业完成总产值计划，而且还要根据国家计划保证全部产品的品种生产计划，并力求不断地改进产品质量，找出一切阻碍工厂进行正常生产的原因，并将其彻底消灭。这个道理是尽人皆知的。但是有很多企业中党的组织却常常不能全面的贯彻执行，有的甚至把完成生产任务同保证产品质量对立起来，他们天天下车间“催部件”，认为：把部件弄出来至少可以保证完成产值计划。他们向职工只是宣传：要生产多少多少价值的产品；但很少向职工宣传：应当用什么样的产品来献给国家，要怎样生产才能保证全面完成国家计划。忽视了动员群众为提高产品质量而斗争。这种宣传方法当然是片面的。
    党的宣传工作在任何情况下，都不能把数量同质量对立起来。重视产品数量同时重视产品质量是党在企业中进行思想工作的一个重要内容。
    为着保证提高产品质量，党组织要永远注意把职工蓬勃的生产热情同熟练地掌握技术统一起来，动员职工既要生产必要数量的产品，同时还要生产高度质量的产品。
    为什么有些工厂产品质量低劣，以及怎样才能克服这个毛病呢？有以下几种情况值得注意和参考。
      一种情况是：有些工厂出了大量的次品和废品，党组织不去过问，使生产长期受到影响。为什么党组织不去过问呢？主要是他们没有深入到工人中去全面地分析研究产品质量低劣的原因，他们抱着一种“不懂科学技术，无法管”的无可奈何的态度。譬如翻砂这项工作，旅大某工厂在苏联专家帮助下作到了百分之百的成品率，哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂在苏联专家帮助下也把废品减少到了极小的数目，但是，据了解有些有翻砂车间或翻砂工段的工厂都订有数额很高的废品率，有的工厂翻砂的实际废品率高达百分之八十。党组织为什么不同这种现象进行斗争呢？原来是有些同志忽略了这样一个基本事实：废品和次品不是天然发生，而是由人造成的；既然是人造成的，也就一定能够被人来消灭。党的工作者去现场时，可能有人把产生次品和废品的原因归罪于天气、原料、工具等客观困难，党的工作者就应当告诉他们：“困难是有的，可是国家委托给我们的任务就是克服困难”，“人的努力一定会把困难减少到最低限度”。翻砂车间的生产条件和技术操作方法，在很多工厂来说并没有很大的差别，为什么在苏联专家帮助下就能达到百分之百的成品率呢？原因就在于：第一，他们坚决反对“废品不可免”的唯心论思想，不承认有什么产生废品的不可抗拒的法则，他们坚信：“人一定能征服自然”，在群众中树立了自觉地坚决同废品作斗争的思想；第二，他们改善了作业环境，推行了文明生产，采取了对产品的严格检查制度，发动了群众性的检查监督工作来保证质量；第三，他们改善了劳动组织，合理地组织了技术作业过程，采取了一切措施来消灭生产中的各个薄弱环节，这些作法大大地发挥了人的主观能动性，从而保证了产品质量的提高。这些作法并没有什么高深的技术，但却是一个严重的思想工作和组织工作。沈阳有个工厂，工人在生产中经常损坏工具，影响了产品质量，但是有人认为这是“无法避免”的。工厂党组织和宣传员不同意这种看法，他们同生产小组长召集工人用算细账的方法，分析了小组每天浪费工具共一百多件，折合人民币就是三百万元，一年就要给国家浪费十几亿元，使大家大吃一惊。接着宣传员又向工人宣传了工具来源的困难，说明“制造一件工具要经过三十多道工序，要耗费好多工人弟兄的血汗，制造一件量具就需要一个八级钳工做一个多月，我们不能白白的浪费工人弟兄的血汗”。党的宣传员又从工人中找到了一贯爱惜工具的先进人物和模范事迹，进行了宣传，终于改变了群众的认识，他们说：“过去总寻思在这样大的工厂里，损坏点工具算不了啥，没想到这就影响到了国家社会主义建设。”从此，过去认为“不可避免”的事情终于消灭了。
    一种情况是：有些人常常把完不成产品质量指标的责任推给上级，说“上级对质量要求太高，工人跟不上”。实际情况并不完全是这样，根据对沈阳空气压缩机厂等单位的了解，产品质量低劣的主要原因并不是上级要求高，而是由于有许多职工还不了解为什么要按照国家要求提高产品质量的道理。因此党的宣传部门首先要正确地宣传提高产品质量的政治意义和经济意义。根据沈阳市委宣传部材料，沈阳冶炼厂所生产的电锌常常达不到“四个九”（含纯锌百分之九九点九九）的要求。这个厂锌电解车间中和工段的总工长薛宝泰同志是党的宣传员，他主动要求在党支部举办的质量展览会上担任说明员。薛宝泰的宣传方法很值得学习，他说：“我们知道锌是合金的原料，锌有很多金属所不具备的特点，其中主要的是：不热涨冷缩，不生锈。
  ‘三个九’的锌用处最大最广，从工业生产用的各种机器，到火车、汽车、轮船、道轨以及我们每天生产中使用的铁水桶都必须有锌。机器的轴承有锌就能保证机器的精密；没有锌，机器转动就不正常，车出来的部件也就不规矩。‘四个九’的锌用处更大。比如一部机器本来能使用十年，如果轴承上有‘四个九’的锌就能使用十五年到二十年。”薛宝泰又讲到锌在国防建设上的用途，他说：“当战士打仗冲锋的时候，一旦枪夹了壳子，就连烧火棍也不能顶啦！要保证枪不夹壳子，那么壳子上必须用‘四个九’的锌。大家想一想，我们的工作该是多么重要。”薛宝泰这样一讲，大家被鼓动起来，工人都说“开了脑筋”“再不注意质量就要影响国家建设了”。接着薛宝泰又召开了中和工段的技术研究会，寻找提高质量的办法，启发大家揭发工段里存在的问题。有的工人揭发了“砷锑没除净就往净液工段放液”，有的揭发了“往净液工段打混液”等七八项事实。讨论的结果大家一致认为：产品质量达不到标准的主要原因是在操作中不遵守操作规程所造成的。会议根据这些情况订出了执行操作规程的制度。会后，薛宝泰同志又对个别落后工人进行了工作。中和工段经过这样的宣传工作和组织工作，就把大家普遍发动起来了，产品锌的质量从“三个九”上升到“四个九”，最近超额完成国家指标，达到了百分之九九点九九一。
    有人把产品质量低劣只归因于工人技术不高，但是却没有积极地对职工进行提高技术的教育，也没有严格要求职工遵守技术操作规程。有的工厂不断地增加新工人，也没有注意结合生产，进行操作规程和技术安全规程的教育。本溪、沈阳有些工厂现在已开始注意总结一贯遵守技术操作规程、没有发生过事故的典型人物的经验。本溪煤矿采煤工人王恒成，五年来没有一次违犯过技术操作规程，也没有发生过事故；去年到十月末，已完成十九个月的采煤定额。他和张秀海师徒二人提出：“保证在今年（一九五四年）年内完成两年采煤定额。”沈阳冶炼厂焙烧炉工人赵柏福六年来没有违反过各项规程制度；反射炉工人张成良连续一千五百六十天安全生产，未出事故。这些终年累月一贯积极劳动的人是工人阶级中光荣的榜样。党组织不能让他们的先进事迹默默无闻。本溪、沈阳及时发现了这些先进人物，并展开了广泛的宣传，通过这些先进人物的事迹去提倡一种坚忍地进行生产的精神，树立起一种勤勤恳恳搞生产的正气，来影响教育群众。这是领导生产提高产品质量的重要方法。
    工厂职工不能很好遵守技术操作规程的另一个原因，是职工不了解为什么要实行产品检验制度，他们把检验员的工作看作是“找岔子”，因此也就不去遵守检验制度，事实证明，那一个工厂中党的领导薄弱，群众工作没有基础，那里的产品质量就不好，操作工人同检验人员就闹不团结。党组织怎样解决这个纠纷呢？有些工厂采取了自流态度，认为“技术问题公说公有理，婆说婆有理”；有的地方抓住双方来个别谈话，解决双方关系问题。其实问题的关键是党组织没有在生产工人和检验人员中树立按照国家统一的质量标准进行生产和检验的原则。只有思想认识统一了，才能作到团结生产。五三工厂三车间有一个时期生产中因检验间断工时很多，有的操作工人对检验工作认识不够，瞧不起检验工，故意拿好产品叫检验工检验，取笑于检验人员。后来，车间宣传员向职工说明：“检验员认真检验质量正是忠于职守，对国家对人民负责的表现，不是对哪个人找岔子”，提出“任何人都应该主动的接受检验，消极对抗是错误的”；另方面，又在检验人员中宣传了主动团结生产工人，提高产品质量，减少停车次数，赶上日进度，对保证完成国家计划的重要意义。经过宣传后，工人们反映：“过去都是因为自己觉悟低，不了解严格检查质量是对国家负责，总以为检验人员是对自己过意不去。”一些检验人员也检查了自己处理问题不冷静和片面性的毛病。党组织在双方思想一致的基础上，发动生产工人和检验工人订联系合同，在合同上双方订立了
  “服从检查”“有事双方商量”等等制度。事后对个别不注意产品质量的人又单独进行了教育，如发现有个别工人还不注意检查产品质量，宣传员就在生产中提醒他：“不要忘了检查，不出废品就是为解放台湾增加了力量！”车间宣传员作了以上一些宣传活动后，小组的产品质量有了显著的提高，废品减少到原有数量的三分之二，返修品由百分之十减到百分之一点五。
    一种情况是：有的党组织对职工中有人制造次品和不能按国家品种计划进行生产的现象采取迁就态度，认为：“提高质量要慢慢来，现在比过去好就得了。”这好像是说事情自己就会慢慢变好的，
  “着急也没有办法”。因此，他们对大量的废品和返修品熟视无睹。据不少工厂的情况来看，产品质量低劣常常是由于职工不能把自己的每日劳动同全面完成国家计划结合起来，不能从国家整体利益出发，来对待自己的劳动，因而形成了追求产品数量，降低产品质量，制造废品的现象。这些现象产生的原因是由于工人中有一些落后思想长期没有得到解决，如有人认为：“质量差点不要紧，赶过数量指标就是好家伙！”少数人认为：“多赚两个计件
  （指计件工资）是正经的事，何必管质量好坏和成本高低呢！”还有人说：“机器设备太老，只有换新机器才能解决问题。”有些地方党组织发现这些问题后，只是作了一般化的宣传，说什么追求“计件”是“经济主义”，“生产废品就是帮助敌人”。这种扣大帽子式的宣传很少有成效。我们不要用那种什么“基本上是好的，但问题是严重的”等说法去
  “安慰”职工，同时也不要只满足讲一般道理，作
  一些空泛的批评了事。党组织应当严肃地公开地指出缺点，查明责任，批评次品和废品的制造者。并支持行政对这些人进行适当的处理。同时，党组织和宣传员应当经常向群众讲这样的题目：“产品质量低劣会给国家造成什么影响”，用具体事实指出生产质量低劣的产品或是不能按品种来进行生产实际上都是损害国家利益的行为，都会在一定程度上影响国家的社会主义建设。譬如辽宁省一九五四年第三季度没有完成特殊钢的生产任务，就影响了四百零五个单位的生产和工程进度。辽宁省统计局对全省第三季度产品质量低劣对国家建设的影响，作了具体分析，这种方法是值得学习的。他们对产品质量低劣的影响的分析有以下几点：第一、使产品大量积压，造成供产销的严重脱节。沈阳高压开关厂因产品质量不合规格，到第三季度末，已积压国家资金四百一十亿元，沈阳变压器厂库存的一部分变压器因质量规格不合需要，已积压资金三百九十六亿元。第二、严重地影响了各订货单位的紧迫需要。沈阳低压开关厂因低压开关质量不良，影响了上海华通开关厂等单位的生产。某石油工厂向他们订制的开关因设计能力过低，把绝缘管烧坏，停产四天。第三、制造了大量废品，只高压开关厂第三季度因生产工人违反操作规程造成的零部件废品即达七千四百七十一件。第四、减少了上缴国家的利润。沈阳油脂化学厂出产的油漆质量低，不好出售，影响上缴利润下降，一九五二年工厂上缴利润是三百九十亿元，一九五三年为六十二亿元，一九五四年计划减为五十八亿元，实际上一至八月已亏本十亿元。党的宣传工作如果能够认真分析产品质量低劣所造成的各种影响，从主观上找出原因和克服困难的力量，打破各种“自流论”的思想，就一定可以鼓舞群众提高产品质量。
    以上各种情况说明，提高产品质量应当是党组织经常性的思想工作，它是动员和组织全体职工保证全面完成国家计划工作的组成部分之一。提高产品质量在很多方面要取决于技术，但生活告诉我们：只有在党的正确领导下，从解决思想问题，树立正确思想入手，才能更好地发挥技术的作用；只有深入细致的思想工作，才能动员和组织职工为掌握技术提高产品质量而斗争。
