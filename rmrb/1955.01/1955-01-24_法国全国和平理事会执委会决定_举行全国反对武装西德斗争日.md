Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 23rd: According to TASS, the Executive Committee of the French National Peace Council has decided to hold a national day of struggle against the arming of West Germany throughout France on February 6th.

The Executive Committee's statement said: "The decision adopted by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council on December 17, 1954, to legally use atomic weapons in the event of war, makes the danger of reviving the 'Bundeswehr' greater than ever, because this 'Bundeswehr' will be equipped with atomic weapons. If the Paris Accords are approved, all of Europe will be threatened by this danger.

The protest movements launched in France and other countries, especially Germany, are capable of thwarting the plan to revive the 'Bundeswehr'."

It has been previously reported that a national "Women's Struggle for Disarmament" day will be held throughout France on January 30th. To this end, representatives of women's organizations from most provinces will hold a meeting in Paris on January 28th.

    法国全国和平理事会执委会决定
    举行全国反对武装西德斗争日
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社巴黎二十二日讯：法国全国和平理事会执行委员会已决定于二月六日在法国各地举行全国反对武装西德斗争日。
    执行委员会的声明说：“北大西洋公约组织理事会一九五四年十二月十七日为了在发生战争时可以合法使用原子武器而通过的决定，使复活‘国防军’的危险比以往任何时候都更大了，因为这支‘国防军’将得到原子武器。如果巴黎协定竟然获得批准，整个欧洲都将受到这一危险的威胁。
    法国和其他国家，特别是德国，所展开的抗议运动是能够挫败复活‘国防军’的计划的。”
    前已报道，一月三十日，法国各地将举行全国“妇女争取裁减军备”斗争日。为此，大多数省份的妇女团体的代表将于一月二十八日在巴黎举行会议。
