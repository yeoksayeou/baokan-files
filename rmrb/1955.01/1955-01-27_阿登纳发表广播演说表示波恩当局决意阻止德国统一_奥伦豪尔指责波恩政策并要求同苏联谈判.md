Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 23rd (via TASS): West German Chancellor Adenauer delivered a radio address on January 22nd, mainly in response to the Soviet government's statement on the German question. This address clearly shows that the Bonn government is determined to support those groups in Western countries who are determined to prevent German reunification.

Adenauer expressed the will of the enemies of German unity, saying, "The idea that the Federal Republic is currently able to conduct fruitful negotiations with the Soviet Union on the issue of reunification under conditions of peace and freedom is politically unrealistic."

It is noteworthy that the reasons put forward by the enemies of German unity are empty and worthless. Adenauer merely repeated the platitudes of advocating the long-bankrupt "position of strength" policy.

Adenauer's speech once again confirms the fact that Bonn does not want truly free elections in Germany in order to unify Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis. The real aim of the Bonn government is to maintain the division of Germany by having West Germany join the aggressive Western European alliance.

Xinhua News Agency, January 25th (via TASS): DPA reports that shortly after Adenauer delivered his radio address on January 22nd, the Chairman of the German Social Democratic Party, Ollenhauer, made a statement saying that Adenauer's speech was "unsatisfactory" and that the main premise of Adenauer's foreign policy was "absolutely negative."

Ollenhauer pointed out that Adenauer's interpretation of the Soviet government's statement was "incorrect." Ollenhauer said that the Soviet government's agreement to international supervision of all-German elections was a step forward in the proposals to Western countries and the Federal Government. He demanded that the Federal Government take strong initiative in response to the Soviet proposal before the Paris Agreements were ratified.

Xinhua News Agency, January 26th (via TASS): West German News Agency reports: The Chairman of the German Social Democratic Party, Ollenhauer, wrote a letter to West German Chancellor Adenauer, urging him to request the governments of the United States, Britain, and France to hold talks with the Soviet Union on the German question before the Paris Agreements are ratified.

Ollenhauer's letter pointed out: The German people are at a decisive period in their post-war history. The vote on the Paris Agreements by the West German legislature is of vital importance to the future of all German people, because the ratification of the Paris Agreements will inevitably result in the permanent division of Germany, and only four-power talks can achieve the reunification of Germany. The Soviet attitude has made it clear that after the ratification of the Paris Agreements, it will no longer be possible to hold talks on the reunification of Germany.

Ollenhauer's letter said: The vast majority of the German people demand that the Federal Republic do everything possible to avoid this consequence. The German Social Democratic Party is convinced that not all possibilities have been exhausted to make a serious attempt to seek the reunification of Germany under freedom through four-power negotiations before the ratification of the Paris Agreements.

Ollenhauer believes that the Soviet government's recent proposal for free elections in Germany would make negotiations on this issue more likely to succeed than at the Berlin Conference in January 1954.

    阿登纳发表广播演说表示波恩当局决意阻止德国统一
    奥伦豪尔指责波恩政策并要求同苏联谈判
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社柏林二十三日讯：西德总理阿登纳一月二十二日发表了一篇主要是针对苏联政府关于德国问题的声明的广播演说。这篇演说明显地表明，波恩政府决心支持西方国家中那些决意要阻止德国统一的集团。
    阿登纳表示了德国统一的敌人的意愿，他说：“有人认为联邦共和国目前能够就在和平和自由的条件下重新统一问题同苏联进行有结果的谈判，这种想法在政治上是不现实的”。
    值得注意的是德国统一的敌人所提出的理由空洞无物。阿登纳仅仅是把叫嚣奉行久已破产了的“实力地位”政策的滥调重复一遍。
    阿登纳的演说再一次证实这一事实：波恩不希望在德国进行真正自由的选举，以便在和平和民主的基础上统一德国，波恩政府的真正目的在于通过使德国西部参加侵略性西欧联盟的办法把德国分裂状态保持下去。
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十三日讯：德意志通讯社报道，德国社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔一月二十二日在阿登纳发表广播演说以后不久发表了一次谈话，说阿登纳的演说是“令人不能满意的”，阿登纳的外交政策的主要前提是“绝对消极的”。
    奥伦豪尔指出，阿登纳对苏联政府的声明所作的解释“是错误的”。奥伦豪尔说，苏联政府同意国际监督全德选举一事是向西方国家和联邦政府的建议前进了一步。他要求联邦政府在巴黎协定获得批准以前有力地对苏联建议采取主动。
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十五日讯：西德德意志新闻社报道：德国社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔写了一封信给西德总理阿登纳，敦促他要求美、英、法三国政府在巴黎协定被批准以前就德国问题同苏联会谈。
    奥伦豪尔的信指出：德国人民正处于他们的战后历史上的决定性时期。西德立法机构就巴黎协定举行的投票，对于全体德国人民的前途有切身的重要意义，因为巴黎协定的批准必然会造成使德国永远分裂的结果，而只有举行四国会谈才能实现德国的重新统一。苏联的态度已经明白表示：批准巴黎协定以后就不再有可能就德国重新统一的问题举行会谈了。
    奥伦豪尔的信说：德国广大人民要求联邦共和国尽一切可能来避免这种后果。德国的社会民主党深信：还没有竭尽一切可能来作一次认真的尝试，以便在批准巴黎协定之前设法通过四国谈判来使德国在自由的情况下恢复统一。
    奥伦豪尔认为：苏联政府在最近的声明中提出的关于在德国举行自由选举的建议，会使得在这个问题上进行的谈判比一九五四年一月柏林会议时更有可能成功。
