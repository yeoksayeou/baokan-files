State-owned Coal Mines Significantly Improve Labor Productivity

Anshan Iron and Steel Production Value Increases by One-Fifth Over the Previous Year

Xinhua News Agency, January 13th: In 1954, the larger state-owned coal mines across the country increased the nation's raw coal production by 2.76 million tons. During this year, the labor productivity of state-owned coal mines greatly improved, with each production worker producing an average of 25 tons more raw coal than in 1953. This resulted in the national state-owned coal mines exceeding the state plan for raw coal production by more than 0.5 percent; the coal production increased by 18.6 percent compared to 1953. In 1954, state-owned coal mines across the country reduced product costs by 188.5 billion yuan, and the profits turned over to the state exceeded the state-prescribed plan targets.

The increase in raw coal production across the country has strongly supported the needs of industrial production, transportation, and civilian coal consumption. In 1954, state-owned coal mines supplied approximately 10 million tons more coal to coking plants, power plants, railways, and civilian use compared to 1953. In addition, state-owned coal mines supplied more than 4 million tons of coal to various regions through the Coal Industry Building Materials Company, exceeding the original plan.

The further promotion of various advanced coal mining methods by state-owned coal mines is an important reason for the increase in raw coal production. After the Ping'an Mine of the Fuxin Mining Bureau tested the sub-section operating regulations, the raw coal production of a pilot working face increased by several thousand tons in less than five months, the labor efficiency increased by 89 percent compared to the state plan, the direct cost was reduced by 34 percent, and more than 810 million yuan was accumulated for the state.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, January 13th: Anshan Iron and Steel Company's employees produced more than 290 billion yuan worth of wealth than the state plan last year, exceeding the original increased production plan by more than 30 billion yuan. Their original plan to save more than 270 billion yuan in a year was also completed in early December last year. Due to the over-fulfillment of production plans and increased production and conservation plans, Anshan Iron and Steel's total production value last year increased by more than 20 percent compared to the previous year.

Last year, Anshan Iron and Steel's employees actively implemented technical organizational measures and studied advanced Soviet experiences in the increased production and conservation movement, which significantly improved production and quality. With the help of Soviet experts, the employees of the primary rolling mill transformed the primary rolling mill, increasing its production capacity by 15 to 20 percent, and initially solving the problem of insufficient production capacity of the primary rolling mill. The workers of the steelmaking plant launched a labor competition in the fourth quarter of last year. In November and December, the smelting time per furnace of steel was shortened by an average of one hour compared to before. In December, the steel ingot produced per square meter of each open-hearth furnace increased by 1.37 tons compared to the first half of the year. The quality of steel shipped to all parts of the country every day also continued to improve. In the second quarter, only 84 tons of first-class products were produced out of 100 tons of medium-sized steel plates, while in December, the number of first-class products increased to 94 tons.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, January 13th: Anshan Iron and Steel's large rolling mill, seamless steel tube plant, and the second automated blast furnace, which have been in operation for more than a year, created many profits for the country last year.

Equipped with advanced Soviet science and technology, Anshan Iron and Steel's three major projects have gradually increased production since they began production on December 26, 1953. The output of heavy rails and large steel produced by the large rolling mill increased by 70 percent in the second half of last year compared to the first half. The quality of seamless steel tubes has also improved significantly. The first-class rate was 91 percent in the first quarter, increased to 93 percent in the third quarter, and further increased to 94 percent in the fourth quarter. The yield rate of seamless steel tubes reached an average of 89 percent in the second half of the year, while it only reached 84.83 percent in the first quarter, greatly reducing waste.

This year, Anshan Iron and Steel's three major projects plan to produce even more varieties and quantities of large steel, heavy rails, seamless steel tubes, and pig iron than last year. The large rolling mill alone plans to produce more than 60 percent more steel than last year, so that in the second year, it will accumulate more construction funds for the country than in the first year.

    国营煤矿劳动生产率显著提高
    鞍钢去年生产总值较前年增加五分之一
    【新华社十三日讯】全国较大的国营煤矿在一九五四年内为国家增产了二百七十六万吨原煤。这一年中，国营煤矿的劳动生产率提高很多，每个生产工人平均比一九五三年多生产了二十五吨原煤，因而使全国国营煤矿原煤的产量，超额百分之零点五以上完成了国家计划；比一九五三年的产煤数量增长了百分之十八点六。全国国营煤矿在一九五四年内降低的产品成本有一千八百八十五亿元，上缴利润超过了国家规定的计划指标。
    全国煤矿原煤产量的增加，有力地支援了工业生产、交通运输和民用煤的需要。一九五四年内，国营煤矿供给炼焦厂、发电厂、铁路和民用的煤，比一九五三年增加了一千万吨左右；此外，国营煤矿一九五四年内通过煤业建筑器材公司供应各地的用煤，比原计划还增加了四百多万吨。
    各国营煤矿进一步推广各种先进采煤方法，是提高原煤产量的一个重要原因。阜新矿务局平安矿试验采掘场子作业规程后，一个试点工作面在不足五个月中，原煤的产量比计划就增多几千吨，劳动效率比国家计划提高百分之八十九，直接成本降低了百分之三十四，为国家多积累了八亿一千多万元。
    【新华社鞍山十三日电】鞍山钢铁公司的职工去年比国家计划多生产了价值二千九百多亿元的财富，比原订的增产计划还多三百多亿元。他们原订的在去年一年内节约二千七百多亿元的计划，也早在去年十二月初完成了。由于生产计划和增产节约计划的超额完成，鞍钢去年的生产总值比前年增加了百分之二十以上。
    去年鞍钢职工在增产节约运动中积极贯彻技术组织措施计划和学习苏联先进经验，使产量和质量得到了显著提高。初轧厂职工们在苏联专家帮助下改造了初轧机，使初轧机的生产能力提高了百分之十五到二十，初步解决了初轧机生产能力不足的问题。炼钢厂的工人去年第四季度开展了劳动竞赛，在十一、十二两个月中，每炉钢的冶炼时间平均比以前缩短了一小时；十二月份每座平炉每平方公尺出产的钢锭，比上半年增加了一点三七吨。每天输送到全国各地的钢材质量也不断提高。在第二季度里，一百吨中型钢板中一级品只有八十四吨，十二月份一级品就增加到九十四吨。
    【新华社鞍山十三日电】开工生产一年多的鞍钢大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂和第二座自动化炼铁炉，在去年一年中为国家创造了许多利润。
    以苏联先进的科学技术装备起来的鞍钢三大工程，从一九五三年十二月二十六日开工生产以来，产量逐渐增加。大型轧钢厂所生产的重轨、大型钢材等，去年下半年就比上半年增加了百分之七十。无缝钢管的质量也有显著提高，一级品第一季为百分之九十一，第三季增加到百分之九十三，第四季又提高到百分之九十四。无缝钢管的收合率下半年平均达到百分之八十九，而第一季度只达到百分之八十四点八三，废品大大减少。
    今年，鞍钢三大工程计划比去年生产品种和数量更多的大型钢材、重轨、无缝钢管和生铁。只是大型轧钢厂就计划比去年多生产百分之六十以上的钢材，这样，第二年将比第一年为国家积累更多的建设资金。
