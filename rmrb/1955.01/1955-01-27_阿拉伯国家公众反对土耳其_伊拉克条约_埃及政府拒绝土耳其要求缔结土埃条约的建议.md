Xinhua News Agency, January 26th: Cairo News – The Arab League Prime Ministers' Conference continued in Cairo on the 25th. The conference is being held to discuss the situation arising from Iraq's decision to conclude a military treaty with Turkey.

According to Cairo newspapers, the prime ministers of the Arab League countries participating in the meeting are constantly receiving telegrams from all over the Arab world protesting against the Turkish-Iraqi treaty. The public in various Arab countries are demanding that the prime ministers firmly oppose the conspiracy to drag Arab countries into an alliance with Western imperialism.

Egypt's "Al-Gomhuria" reported that throughout the Arab region, the movement against the Iraqi-Turkish military treaty is surging.

The Lebanese National Student Committee issued declarations and leaflets condemning the Turkish-Iraqi military treaty as a betrayal of the national interests of the Arab people. After the National Student Committee was disbanded for publishing these declarations and leaflets, students in Beirut held a hunger strike to protest. The authorities of the American University of Beirut expelled forty-five Arab students who participated in the hunger strike. This action provoked protests from students in many cities in Lebanon. On January 24, students in Tripoli, Tyre, and Sidon held demonstrations in support of the expelled students. On the same day, forty Syrian students arrived in Beirut to express their support for the expelled students.

On the 23rd, Arab students studying in various universities in Egypt held a mass rally, attended by more than two thousand people. They passed a resolution condemning the Iraqi government's intention to conclude a treaty with Turkey, and sent telegrams to King Faisal II of Iraq and Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Said to express their protest.

Students of the Faculty of Engineering of Cairo University, in a telegram to the prime ministers of the Arab countries, accused the Menderes-Nuri al-Said agreement of attempting to tie the Arab people to the chariot of imperialism.

According to Syrian newspapers, six hundred students of the Syrian University in Damascus wrote a letter to the Syrian government and other Arab governments while the Arab League Prime Ministers were holding a meeting in Cairo. The students demanded in their letter that the Syrian government urge Arab countries to adopt an independent foreign policy—a completely neutral policy opposed to any military alliances.

Egypt's "Al-Gomhuria" published an editorial saying: "The people of the Arab countries condemn the Turkish-Iraqi treaty and demand that their governments follow a policy of strict neutrality." The editorial said: "The heads of government participating in the (Arab League Prime Ministers') meeting in Cairo should implement the will of their people. They should condemn the Turkish-Iraqi treaty and declare an independent policy that is not hindered by any alliances, 'common defense' treaties, or other agreements with imperialist countries."

Xinhua News Agency, January 26th: According to TASS, Cairo, January 25th: Newspapers reported that the Egyptian government has rejected the Turkish government's formal proposal for an Egypt-Turkey treaty similar to the Turkish-Iraqi treaty.

"Al-Gomhuria" reported: "The Egyptian Foreign Minister has told the Turkish Ambassador that Egypt refuses to participate in bilateral agreements or alliances outside the Arab League. Egypt believes that the Arab Collective Security Pact is the best defense system for the region and refuses to conclude any defensive treaty with Turkey."

"Rouz el-Youssef" magazine reported that the Egyptian Minister of National Guidance, Salah Salem, told the magazine's reporter: "A military alliance with Turkey would mean joining an alliance with Britain and the United States." Salem said that Arab countries "should adopt a national independent policy."

"Al-Gomhuria" said in an editorial: "In all the countries of the Arab world, the people who are fighting for freedom, peace and progress demand: 'Down with military treaties!' Arabs in Damascus, Beirut, Baghdad, Amman, and Cairo have expressed their unanimous rejection of participation in imperialist military treaties."

    阿拉伯国家公众反对土耳其—伊拉克条约
    埃及政府拒绝土耳其要求缔结土埃条约的建议
    【新华社二十六日讯】开罗消息：阿拉伯联盟国家总理会议二十五日继续在开罗举行。这个会议是为了讨论因伊拉克决定同土耳其缔结军事条约而引起的局势。
    据开罗报纸报道，参加会议的阿拉伯联盟国家的总理们不断收到从阿拉伯各地来的抗议土耳其—伊拉克条约的电报。阿拉伯各国公众要求总理们坚决反对把阿拉伯国家拖入同西方帝国主义联盟的阴谋。
    埃及“共和国报”报道，在阿拉伯地区的各个角落，反对伊拉克和土耳其签订军事条约的运动正在高涨。
    黎巴嫩全国学生委员会发表了宣言和传单，谴责土耳其—伊拉克军事条约背叛阿拉伯人的民族利益。在全国学生委员会由于发表这些宣言和传单而被解散后，贝鲁特的学生举行绝食罢课表示抗议。贝鲁特美国大学当局开除了四十五名参加绝食罢课的阿拉伯学生。这个行动激起了黎巴嫩许多城市的学生的抗议。一月二十四日，的黎波里、第雷、赛义达等城市的学生都曾举行示威游行，声援被开除的学生。同一天，还有四十个叙利亚学生到达贝鲁特表示声援被开除的学生。
    二十三日，在埃及各大学留学的阿拉伯各国的学生举行了群众大会，参加大会的有两千多人。他们通过一项决议，谴责伊拉克政府打算和土耳其缔结条约，并且致电伊拉克国王费萨尔二世和伊拉克首相努里·赛义德表示抗议。
    开罗大学工程系学生在致阿拉伯各国总理的电报中，指责曼德列斯和努里·赛义德的协议是企图把阿拉伯人民绑在帝国主义的战车上。
    据叙利亚报纸报道，大马士革的叙利亚大学的六百个学生在阿拉伯各国总理在开罗举行会议的时候，写了一封信给叙利亚政府和其他阿拉伯国家政府。学生们在信中要求叙利亚政府敦促阿拉伯国家采取独立的外交政策——完全中立的、反对任何军事联盟的政策。
    埃及“共和国报”发表社论说：“阿拉伯国家的人民谴责土耳其—伊拉克条约，并要求他们的政府遵循严格中立的政策。”社论说：“参加在开罗举行的（阿拉伯联盟国家总理）会议的政府首脑们应该执行他们的人民的意志。他们应该谴责土耳其—伊拉克条约，并宣布实行不受任何联盟、‘共同防御’条约或同帝国主义国家的其他协定阻碍的独立政策。”
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社开罗二十五日讯：报纸报道，埃及政府已经拒绝土耳其政府提出的关于缔结和土耳其—伊拉克条约类似的土耳其—埃及条约的正式建议。
    “共和国报”报道：“埃及外交部长已经告诉土耳其大使说，埃及拒绝参加阿拉伯联盟以外的双边协定或者联盟。埃及认为阿拉伯国家集体安全公约是这个地区的最好防御体系，并且拒绝同土耳其缔结任何防御性的条约。”
    “鲁兹·优素福”杂志报道，埃及国家指导部部长赛拉·萨勒姆对这个杂志的记者说：“同土耳其缔结军事联盟就意味着参加同英国和美国的联盟。”萨勒姆说，阿拉伯国家“应该采取民族的独立政策”。
    “共和国报”在一篇社论中说：“在阿拉伯世界的所有国家中，为自由、和平和进步而斗争的人民要求：‘打倒军事条约！’大马士革、贝鲁特、巴格达、安曼和开罗的阿拉伯人都表示，他们一致拒绝参加帝国主义的军事条约。”
