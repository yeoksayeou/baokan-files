The members of the Longdong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Duyun County, Guizhou Province, get up every morning before dawn, carrying shoulder poles and sickles, and go to the hills behind the village to cut grass and collect manure. Last year, due to the large amount of manure accumulated, the cooperative's grain production increased by 30%, so the members are even more enthusiastic about accumulating manure, and each member has a manure accumulation plan. Women are not lagging behind in the work of accumulating manure. Meng Yongying, a Miao ethnic woman, cuts three big loads a day. Zhou Zhizhen completed 70% of her manure accumulation plan in three days. Her achievement was praised on the blackboard newspaper, and Li Peiyu and others heard about it and competed with her, and their work efficiency doubled compared to the beginning. As of now, the whole cooperative has accumulated more than 250,000 jin of manure and 21,000 jin of newly cut grass, exceeding the original manure accumulation plan.

    龙洞农业社积了很多土肥
    贵州省都匀县龙洞农业生产合作社的社员们，每天早上天亮时就三三五五地扛着扁担，拿着镰刀，到背后坡山上割草积肥去了。去年由于积肥多社内粮食增产了三成，因而社员们对积肥更加积极，每个社员都订有积肥计划。妇女们在积肥工作中也不落后，苗族女社员蒙永英一天割三大挑。周治珍三天完成她积肥计划的百分之七十。黑板报上表扬了她，李培玉等听说了就和她比赛，工作效率也比开始提高了一倍。截至目前为止，全社已积肥二十五万余斤，新割的草二万一千斤，已超过了原订的积肥计划。　（本报贵州记者站）
