    Responsible for Resettling Farmers When Requisitioning Land
    To the Editor:

    Since 1950, Nanchang City has requisitioned large tracts of farmland from peasants to build new factories, schools, government office buildings, and dormitories. According to statistics, by November 1954, the city had requisitioned over 7,900 mu of land. The government, as stipulated, gave the farmers considerable compensation for the requisitioned land and helped some relocated farmers solve their re-employment problems. The suburban farmers actively support the large-scale economic and cultural construction of the country, but the problems of some farmers still need to be properly addressed.

    From the beginning of land requisition, the Nanchang Municipal People's Government recognized that being responsible for resettling relocated farmers and continuing production was an important task. They had conducted special discussions and studies on this issue and also proposed some solutions. For example, since Nanchang City still relies on outside sources for some of its vegetable supply, organizing some farmers to convert some grain fields into vegetable production is very necessary. Also, in some parts of Jiangxi Province where there is more land than people, farmers can be mobilized and helped to relocate, etc. But so far, these are still resolutions on paper and have not been translated into active action. This makes some farmers whose land has been requisitioned feel uneasy and creates some obstacles for the future requisition of large amounts of farmland from farmers. We believe that there will inevitably be many difficulties in helping farmers continue production, but this problem must be solved, and as long as we conduct careful investigation and research and do our work well, the problem will be properly solved.

### 征用土地时要负责安置农民

    征用土地时要负责安置农民编辑同志：
    从一九五○年以来，南昌市曾征用了农民的大片土地，陆续新建了一些工厂、学校、机关办公楼和宿舍。据统计，到一九五四年十一月止，全市征用土地已增至七千九百多亩。政府对被征用的土地照规定给了农民相当的代价和补偿，并帮助了部分迁居的农民解决转业问题，郊区农民对国家大规模的经济建设和文化建设都是积极支持的，但是有一部分农民的问题，还需要继续作出妥善的安排。
    南昌市人民政府在一开始征用农民土地的时候，就认识到负责安置迁移的农民，继续进行生产是一项重要的工作。关于这个问题，他们曾作了专门的讨论和研究，也提出了一些解决问题的办法。例如：目前南昌市有一部分蔬菜还依靠外地供应，因此，把一部分农民组织起来将一部分粮田改为蔬菜生产，是十分需要的。又如：江西省有些地方地多人少，也可以动员和帮助一部分农民转移等等，但到现在为止，这还是纸上的决议，没有变成积极的行动。这样，就使得一部分被征用了土地的农民老是不能安下心来，并为今后继续征用农民大量土地造成了某种程度的障碍。我们认为，帮助农民继续生产的问题，必然会有很多困难，但这个问题必须解决，而且只要我们认真加以调查研究，做好工作，问题也会得到妥善解决的。　李亮
