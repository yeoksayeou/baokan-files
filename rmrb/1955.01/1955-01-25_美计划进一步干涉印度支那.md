Xinhua News Agency, Saigon, January 24th: It is reported from Saigon that U.S. Special Envoy to South Vietnam, Collins, already left Saigon by plane on the 21st to return to the United States. It is understood that President Eisenhower summoned Collins back to the country this time to discuss the plan for the United States to further intervene in Indochina through military aid and the reorganization of the South Vietnamese puppet army. Collins will report to Eisenhower on the negotiation situation regarding these plans.

A United Press report said that on the eve of his return to the country, Collins had reached an agreement with Ngo Dinh Diem and Ély on the reorganization of the South Vietnamese puppet army. The main task of this army will be to "restore and maintain internal order," in other words, to use it to strengthen the reign of terror, stifle the democratic freedom of the South Vietnamese people, and undermine the free general election in Vietnam stipulated by the Geneva Accords.

The report also revealed that this army will have approximately 90,000 regular troops and 100,000 to 150,000 "reserve troops." In addition, "auxiliary local police forces" will be established. The armies of the Cao Dai, Hoa Hao, and Binh Xuyen sects will have some elements incorporated into the "reserve army."

The United States will undertake the work of reorganizing and training the puppet army. Ngo Dinh Diem's Minister of National Defense, Ho Thong Minh, told reporters in Hong Kong on the 21st while en route to Manila that preparations for the U.S. Army to train South Vietnamese troops have been completed, and the actual training work may begin soon. According to a French news agency report, the U.S. military assistance advisory group in South Vietnam will send officers to help reorganize the South Vietnamese army. Most of the U.S. officers will be assigned to the South Vietnamese General Staff Headquarters, the Saigon Military Academy, the Da Lat Active Officer School, and the Thu Duc Reserve Officer School.

At the same time, France's position in the puppet army will gradually be squeezed out. Agence France-Presse reported that from June 1955 onwards, French officers will withdraw from command positions in the puppet army and will only be employed as technical experts and consultants.

    美计划进一步干涉印度支那
    【新华社二十四日讯】西贡消息：美国驻南越特使柯林斯已经在二十一日乘飞机离开西贡前往美国。据悉，美国总统艾森豪威尔这次召柯林斯回国，是为了就美国通过军事援助及整编南越伪军等办法来进一步干涉印度支那的计划进行磋商。柯林斯将向艾森豪威尔报告关于这些计划的谈判情况。
    合众社消息说，柯林斯在回国前夕，已经和吴庭艳、埃利就整编南越伪军问题达成协议，这支陆军的主要任务将是“恢复和维持内部秩序”，换句话说，就是用它来加强恐怖统治，扼杀南越人民的民主自由，以破坏日内瓦协定所规定的越南自由普选。
    消息还透露：这支陆军大约将有九万名正规军和十万名到十五万名“后备军”。此外，“辅助性的地方警察部队”将建立起来。高台教、和好教和平川教的军队将有一部分被并入“后备军”。
    美国将要担负起整编和训练伪军的工作。吴庭艳政府国防部长胡统明在二十一日前往马尼拉途中经过香港时对记者说：由美国陆军训练南越军队的准备工作已经做好，实际的训练工作可能在最近开始。据法国新闻社消息透露：美国驻南越的军事援助顾问团将派遣军官来帮助整编南越军队。大部分美国军官将被分配到南越参谋本部、西贡的军事学院、大叻的现役军官学校和守德的后备军官学校中去。
    同时，法国在伪军中的地位将逐渐受到排挤。法新社消息说，从一九五五年六月以后，法国军官将退出在伪军中的指挥职位，而只能被雇用为技术专家和顾问。
