    In Beijing, more than 130 philosophers, scientists, and philosophy enthusiasts gathered on the 14th to criticize the decadent bourgeois worldview of the Hu Shih faction. This was the second topic presided over by the "Hu Shih Thought Criticism Discussion Group Working Committee" regarding the critical discussion of Hu Shih's philosophical thought.
    The discussion was chaired by Ai Siqi.
    At the meeting, Hu Sheng first gave a brief explanation of his article "On the Decadent Bourgeois Worldview of the Hu Shih Faction" published in the "People's Daily". Hu Sheng's article analyzed some of the basic arguments of the Hu Shih faction's worldview and exposed the decadent and malicious essence of Hu Shih's worldview. Hu Sheng said: "Hu Shih came out to vociferously promote individualism during a period when the people's revolutionary movement led by the Chinese proletariat was constantly rising, with the aim of corrupting the thinking of the broad masses of the Chinese people, undermining the collectivism they had forged through struggle, and especially corrupting the thinking of intellectuals, preventing them from integrating with the workers and peasants." Hu Sheng then pointed out: "Practical life shows that without the collective strength to fight for national freedom and liberation, and for the freedom and liberation of the people, the Chinese people will not have individual freedom and liberation."
    The meeting then launched a discussion based on Hu Sheng's article. Feng Youlan, Fang Hua, Wang Qingshu, Pan Zinian, Chen Zhongping, Jin Yuelin, Ren Jiyu, Sun Dingguo, He Lin and others spoke at the meeting to criticize the worldview of the Hu Shih faction. They believed that Hu Sheng's article had partisanship and militancy; some of them also requested that Hu Sheng's article elaborate more on the Marxist worldview. This would be of greater help to readers. (Xinhua News Agency)
    The various departments of arts at Peking University, in conjunction with the criticism of Hu Shih's bourgeois idealist thought, have determined various special research topics.
    The teaching and research sections of the Philosophy Department have drafted nine special topics, conducting systematic criticisms from Hu Shih's political thought, philosophical thought, methodology, and Hu Shih's research on the history of Chinese philosophy. In order to thoroughly eliminate the influence of Hu Shih's reactionary philosophical thought, the teaching and research sections are also preparing to conduct special studies and criticisms of experimentalism and Dewey's psychology.
    Teachers from the Chinese Literature History teaching and research section of the Department of Chinese Language and Literature have formed three groups to specifically criticize Hu Shih's "History of Vernacular Literature", "Chinese Literature in the Last Fifty Years" and to study the popular and artistic nature of "Dream of the Red Chamber". The Chinese Language teaching and research section and the Language teaching and research section plan to hold a discussion meeting once a month, requiring the gradual elimination of Hu Shih's influence in linguistics. History Department teachers are also drafting special topics to criticize Hu Shih's reactionary view of history and to study the role of textual research in academic research. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Shanghai has established the Shanghai Academic and Cultural Circles Hu Shih Thought Criticism Discussion Group, consisting of a working committee of fifteen people from Shanghai's academic and cultural circles, with Peng Kang as the director. It is divided into five groups: philosophy, politics, literature, history, and education, to organize relevant personnel to participate in discussions separately.
    The establishment of the Shanghai Academic and Cultural Circles Hu Shih Thought Criticism Discussion Group was decided at a forum of Shanghai academic and cultural figures convened by the Culture and Education Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Consultative Committee on the 8th of this month. This forum discussed the criticism of the bourgeois idealist thought of the Hu Shih faction. Nearly 100 people from Shanghai's academic and cultural circles participated in the forum.

    在北京的哲学家、科学家等集会
    批判胡适派腐朽的资产阶级人生观
    上海市学术文化界胡适思想批判讨论会成立
    在北京的哲学家、科学家和哲学爱好者一百三十多人十四日集会批判胡适派腐朽的资产阶级人生观。这是“胡适思想批判讨论会工作委员会”所主持的关于胡适哲学思想批判讨论的第二个题目。
    讨论会由艾思奇主持。
    会上，胡绳首先把他发表在“人民日报”上的“论胡适派腐朽的资产阶级人生观”一文作了扼要的说明。胡绳的文章剖析了胡适派人生观的一些基本论点，揭穿了胡适人生观的腐朽、恶毒的本质。胡绳说：“胡适在中国无产阶级领导的人民革命运动不断高涨的时期，出来声嘶力竭地宣传个人主义，其目的是在腐蚀中国人民大众的思想，破坏他们通过斗争而锻炼起来的集体主义，其目的又特别是在腐蚀知识分子的思想，阻止他们去和工农群众相结合。”胡绳接着指出：“实际生活表明，不用集体的力量去争取民族的自由和解放，争取人民的自由和解放，中国人民是不会有个人的自由和解放的。”
    会议接着根据胡绳的文章展开了讨论。在会上发言批判胡适派人生观的有冯友兰、方华、王庆淑、潘梓年、陈仲平、金岳霖、任继愈、孙定国、贺麟等人。他们认为胡绳的文章是有党性和战斗性的；其中有些人同时还要求胡绳的文章应对马克思主义的人生观更多阐发一些。这样，对读者会有更大的帮助。　（新华社）
    北京大学文科各系结合批判胡适资产阶级唯心论思想确定各种专题研究题目。
    哲学系各教研室已拟订九个专题，从胡适的政治思想、哲学思想、思想方法和胡适在中国哲学史的研究等方面进行系统的批判。为了彻底肃清胡适反动哲学思想影响，各教研室并准备就实验主义和杜威的心理学作专题研究和批判。
    中国语言文学系中国文学史教研室的教师，已组成三个小组，专门批判胡适的“白话文学史”、“五十年来中国之文学”和研究“红楼梦”的人民性和艺术性。汉语教研室和语言教研室准备每月举行一次讨论会，要求逐步肃清胡适在语言学方面的流毒。历史系教师也正拟定专题，就胡适的反动历史观进行批判，并对考据学在学术研究中的作用进行研究。　（新华社）
    上海市成立了上海学术文化界胡适思想批判讨论会，由上海学术文化界人士十五人组成工作委员会，以彭康为主任，并分设哲学、政治、文学、历史、教育等五个组，分别组织有关人士参加讨论。
    成立上海学术文化界胡适思想批判讨论会，是本月八日在上海市协商委员会文化教育委员会召集的上海学术文化界人士的座谈会上决定的。这个座谈会曾就批判胡适派资产阶级唯心论进行了讨论。参加座谈会的有上海学术文化界人士近百名。　（新华社）
