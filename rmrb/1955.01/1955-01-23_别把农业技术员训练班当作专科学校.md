There is a type of very enthusiastic person who always wants to tell others everything they know all at once. However, when they are giving a long-winded speech, they don't carefully look at the people in front of them: are they old men or children, people in a hurry to handle important matters or wandering curiosity seekers? Nor do they pay attention to whether people understand what they are saying or are interested in their words.

Among the cadres in various places who are in charge of agricultural production cooperative technician training classes, many of these "enthusiastic people" have emerged. In just one "Situation Briefing on Winter Training for Agricultural Production Cooperative Technicians in Henan Province," so many were mentioned: the animal husbandry training class in Lushi County lectured on "Pharmacology" and "Feed Analysis"; the animal husbandry training class in Lin County lectured on "Animal Anatomy"; the technician training class in Luoyang County lectured on twenty-four kinds of crop diseases and insect pests, some of which are rare in the local area; the training class in Suiping County taught agricultural techniques including land preparation, moisture conservation, intensive planting, pest and disease control, and many other kinds, and the crops covered included wheat, millet, soybeans, sesame, sweet potatoes, cotton, tobacco, etc., truly comprehensive, "everything" was available; the technical training content in Anyang County included cotton, millet, wheat, as well as diseases and insect pests, soil analysis, and so on.

The trainees in the training classes should be middle school graduates, right? Unfortunately, in our rural areas, there are not so many middle school graduates to be found right now; generally speaking, a county wants to train more than a thousand people, and they are mostly ordinary farmers selected from various agricultural production cooperatives. Moreover, some places, because they did not prepare for the training of technicians early, sent out notices and wanted people immediately, and the agricultural production cooperatives did not understand the significance of the training, and even sent some people to make up the numbers. In the training class in Luoyang County, there were sixty-eight-year-old men and fourteen-year-old girls.

The training time should be three years, two years, or at least six months or three months, right? Unfortunately, in our rural areas, we cannot spare so many people for such a long time to "separate from production" for specialized study. The name is "winter training," so of course the classes are held in winter; since the goal is to train as many people as possible, of course the classes must be held in multiple sessions; and winter is not very idle, there are still many production tasks and other things to do in the cooperatives, and it is impossible to train for a whole winter. Generally, each session is only about a month long.

The curriculum of the training classes in Lushi and other counties cannot be said to be like an agricultural college, but at least it is like an agricultural vocational school; although some courses are learnable by farmers, they cannot be learned in a short "winter training." No wonder the trainees said, "The more I learn, the more confused I become." If you want the trainees not to be "confused," the comrades in charge of the training classes must be more practical and not be enthusiastic fools!

    别把农业技术员训练班当作专科学校
    杨叶
    有一种非常热心的人，总想把自己所知道的东西一下子全部告诉别人。但是，当他哇啦哇啦地演讲的时候，他并不仔细看看他面前是什么样的人，是老头子还是小孩子，是急急忙忙赶办要事的人还是游游荡荡的猎奇者，也不注意人家是不是听得懂他的话，是不是对他的话感到兴趣。
    在各地主持农业生产合作社技术员训练班的干部中间，就出现了不少的这种“热心的人”。只在一份“河南省农业生产合作社技术员冬训情况简报”中，就提到了这么多：卢氏县的畜牧训练班中讲授“药理学”“饲料分析”；林县的畜牧训练班讲授“牲畜解剖学”；洛阳县的技术员训练班讲授的作物病虫害有二十四种，其中有些病虫害是当地很少有的；遂平县的训练班教的农业技术包括了整地、保墒、密植、防治病虫等许多种，讲的作物种类包括麦子、谷子、大豆、芝麻、红薯、棉花、烟叶等等，真是面面俱到，“应有”尽有；安阳县的技术训练内容有棉花、谷子、小麦，还有病虫害、土壤分析等等。
    训练班的学员该是中学毕业生吧？可惜，在我们的农村里，眼前还找不到那么多中学毕业生；一个县要训练的人，一般地说总在千人以上，他们多是各个农业生产合作社选派来的普通农民。况且，有的地方因为没有及早做好训练技术员的准备工作，下了通知就要人，农业生产合作社又没有把受训的意义弄明白，还派了些凑数应差的人。洛阳县的训练班里，就有六十八岁的老头，十四岁的女孩子。
    训练的时间该是三年两年、至少也要半年三月吧？可惜，在我们的农村里眼前还抽不出这么多人，用这么久的时间，“脱离生产”专门学习。名为“冬训”，当然是在冬季开班；既然训练的人是力求其多，当然必须分期开班；而且冬季并不很闲，合作社里还有不少生产任务和别的事情要干，想整整训练一冬都不可能。一般的，每期不过是一个月光景而已。
    卢氏等县的训练班的课程，不能说是农学院式的，至少也是农业专科学校式的；有些课程虽然是农民可以学习的，但不是在短短的一次“冬训”中所能学会的。难怪受训的学员们说“越学越糊涂了”。要想学员不“糊涂”，先要主持训练班的同志们切实一些，不当热心的糊涂人！
