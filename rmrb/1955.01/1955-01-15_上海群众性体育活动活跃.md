    Mass sports activities in Shanghai have been further developed. At present, 2,570 basketball, football, and table tennis teams have been formed among metalworking and textile workers throughout the city. In their spare time, they regularly hold friendly matches between workshops and between factories. Last year, the "Factory Sunday Games" and "Sports Evenings" organized by the Shanghai West Workers' Club held more than 200 basketball, volleyball, table tennis, tug-of-war, skill games, and martial arts competitions and performances. More than 500 worker football teams from grassroots factories participated in the city-wide workers' football tournament that began in December last year.
    Sports activities among students in various schools are also very active. There are more than 8,000 sports training groups among secondary school students throughout the city.
    Last year, the city held 40 large-scale sports competitions, performances, and sports meets, with more than 125,000 workers, students, and cadres from government organizations participating; the audience numbered more than 2 million. Currently, there are more than 100 floodlit sports fields in the city alone. The restoration project of the large-scale Jiangwan Stadium is nearing completion. The Shanghai East Stadium and the Shanghai South Stadium, located in areas with a high concentration of factories, have also increased their sports equipment.
