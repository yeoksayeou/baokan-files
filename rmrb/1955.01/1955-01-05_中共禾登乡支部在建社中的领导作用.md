    The Leading Role of the CCP Hedeng Township Branch in the Establishment of Cooperatives
    By our reporter Ji Xichen
    In Hedeng Township, Xinfan County, Sichuan Province, during the large-scale establishment of cooperatives before the autumn harvest, the Party branch played a central leading role, adhered to the policy of persuasion and education, and deeply mobilized the masses. In nearly two months, in addition to expanding one old cooperative, forty-four new cooperatives were established. All sixteen villages in the township now have cooperatives. The number of peasant households joining the cooperatives accounts for 78 percent of the total number of agricultural households in the township, and the land entering the cooperatives accounts for 74 percent of the total cultivated land area. The entire township has basically achieved cooperation.

    I

    Over the past year, after the publicity of the general line and the state monopoly of purchase and marketing in Hedeng Township, especially influenced by the production superiority displayed by the Xinmin Agricultural Production Cooperative led by Luo Shifa, a representative of the National People's Congress, the enthusiasm of the township's peasants for mutual aid and cooperation has greatly increased. Groups of people visited the Xinmin Agricultural Production Cooperative, and many peasants said anxiously to Luo Shifa: "Is your cooperative's door open? Or is it closed?" "Can you establish a branch in our village?" Some took out their land deeds on the spot and said, "We've been waiting from last year to this year, and this time we must join the cooperative!"

    Faced with this new situation in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the CCP Hedeng Township Branch, in accordance with instructions from the higher-level Party committee, convened a township-wide Party member meeting in July of last year to discuss the establishment of cooperatives. Should we develop a large number of new cooperatives? Or should we continue to focus on one key old cooperative? A debate ensued at the meeting. Some people emphasized "steady development" and "taking it slow," asking the masses who wanted to join the cooperative to "wait a while" outside the cooperative, reasoning that "a big tree will have branches, and a big family will split," fearing that too many would cause trouble and that they would be responsible if things went wrong. Others, however, ignored the difficulties in establishing cooperatives, showing blind optimism, saying: "What's so difficult about establishing cooperatives? As long as the higher-ups give an order, hold a mass meeting, and make a mobilization call, it's guaranteed to be 100 percent!" The branch organized everyone to study the Party Central Committee's policy documents on mutual aid and cooperation. In the study and discussion, everyone criticized the two tendencies of retreating and rushing forward, unified their thinking within the Party, and realized that in leading the agricultural cooperation movement, they must adhere to the development policy of "active leadership, steady progress" and abide by the principles of patient persuasion and voluntary participation in establishing cooperatives. At the same time, the branch guided everyone to analyze the favorable conditions for establishing cooperatives, such as: a relatively strong foundation for mutual aid and cooperation throughout the township (87 percent of the township's households are organized); many leading cadres (35 Party members, more than 100 Communist Youth League members, and eight or nine activists in each village); and a sufficient number of accounting personnel. As long as these conditions are well utilized and the masses are patiently persuaded and educated, it is entirely possible to develop a large number of agricultural cooperatives. Huang Jingxian, the branch secretary and township head, said: "If we don't establish cooperatives, we will fall behind the masses. As long as the entire Party is mobilized and the Party's class line is implemented, we will certainly be able to lead the township's peasants onto the road of cooperation!"

    After the Party member meeting approved the plan for establishing cooperatives, the branch actively trained the backbone for establishing cooperatives. Before the establishment of the cooperatives, a training class for 260 people was held in the township. These people included Communist Party members, members of the Communist Youth League branch committee, the backbone of the old cooperatives, and activists who were prepared to be trained as directors and deputy directors of agricultural cooperatives. In addition to studying the Party's policies on mutual aid and cooperation, especially the rural class policy, the old cooperative cadres also introduced their specific experiences in running cooperatives. This armed the backbone for establishing cooperatives with policy ideas and specific methods. Everyone generally reflected: "With principles and methods, we have the capital to run cooperatives!" After returning from the study, they organized preparatory committees for establishing cooperatives and actively carried out preparatory work. Later, township-wide People's Representative Meetings and township-wide Mutual Aid and Cooperation Representative Conferences were convened to continue to conduct socialist education in depth and absorb the vast number of activists into the work of establishing cooperatives. In order to help the villages carry out the work of establishing cooperatives, in addition to the branch committee members specifically dividing the work for leadership, a group of backbone members were drawn from the old cooperatives to go to the villages to help with the work.

    II

    After the establishment of cooperatives began, some people said: "Socialism is here, let's follow the trend!" Yang Guomin, a cadre of Sixteen Village, said to the peasants: "Whoever doesn't join the cooperative now will never be allowed to join it in their lifetime!" The Party branch discovered this sentiment among the cadres and the masses, and realized that the ideological mobilization work was not deep enough, and immediately launched a large-scale publicity campaign throughout the township. In addition to holding three or four mass meetings in each village, each unit establishing a cooperative also separately convened forums with old peasants, young people, women, poor peasants, middle peasants, and households with cattle. Through recollections and comparisons, combined with specific examples, they summarized the benefits that the mutual aid and cooperation movement had brought to the peasants. In response to the different situations of various people, they adopted the method of "one key opens one lock" to specifically eliminate the ideological concerns of the masses. Some people in Donglin Village suspected that there were too many people in the cooperative and feared that production would not increase. The Party小组 used the fact that in the summer harvest, the Xinmin First Branch of the cooperative yielded 139 jin of rapeseed per mu, the Hongxing mutual aid team yielded 127 jin, and the individual peasant Xu Jiliang yielded only 102 jin per mu to illustrate that only unified land management and unified use of labor can increase production more. Everyone said: "Individual farming is not as good as mutual aid teams, and mutual aid teams are not as good as agricultural cooperatives. To develop production, we must join agricultural cooperatives!" Ninety percent of the households in the village signed up to join the cooperatives. Ran Xingru, a middle peasant in Thirteen Village, mistakenly believed that joining the cooperative would lead to "unjustified equalization," and was unwilling to join. Later, when he learned about the principle of "more work, more pay" in the Xinmin Agricultural Cooperative, he signed up to join the cooperative. The women in Six Village were concerned that they would suffer when evaluating work points after joining the cooperative, and at the same time, they were afraid that eating vegetables, burning firewood, and raising pigs would be inconvenient. After Communist Party member Feng Sanniang went door-to-door to explain that the cooperative implemented "equal pay for equal work" for men and women, and that each member household could also retain land for growing vegetables, everyone happily joined the cooperative. On the basis of everyone voluntarily signing up to join the cooperative, the Party 小组 guided the masses to discuss the conditions for joining the cooperative, and combined publicity and forums to widely carry out individual liaison work among the masses. Yang Ting, a member of the Communist Youth League branch committee in Democratic Village, persuaded more than 20 peasant households to voluntarily organize agricultural cooperatives in the village through individual conversations with the masses. Ran Sishi, a poor peasant in Eight Village, linked up with 15 poor peasant households and 12 middle peasant households to establish agricultural cooperatives.

    When the ideological mobilization was basically mature, the branch led the masses to discuss specific issues. Under the principles of benefiting production, taking care of the habits of the masses, mutual benefit, and fairness and reasonableness, the issues of land, cattle, farm tools, fertilizer, seeds, water mills, etc., were reasonably resolved through democratic discussion. Because the principle of mutual benefit was implemented in all aspects, the economic alliance of poor and middle peasants in the agricultural cooperative was further consolidated, thereby consolidating the agricultural cooperative. The middle peasant Huang Sanhe said: "If it is so fair and reasonable, and neither side suffers, I will join the agricultural cooperative without being told."

    III

    In the early days of establishing cooperatives, many Party members and backbone members for establishing cooperatives still had a vague understanding of the class policy of relying on the poor peasants (including all the new middle peasants who were originally poor peasants), firmly uniting with the middle peasants, and restricting and gradually eliminating the rich peasant economy. Some people ignored relying on the poor peasants, fearing that raising the issue of relying on the poor peasants would "offend" the middle peasants; some underestimated the middle peasants, thinking that uniting with the middle peasants was "optional," and that the middle peasants would follow the poor peasants without uniting. Others lost vigilance against the rich peasants, belittling the destructive role of the rich peasants, saying: "They can't amount to anything." In response to this situation, the Party branch first conducted education on the class line among the Party members' congresses, township people's congresses, and backbone members for establishing cooperatives, so that everyone could realize from policy knowledge and practical life that only the unity of middle and poor peasants could isolate the rich peasants and restrict the exploitation of rich peasants. Qiu Rongwu, a poor peasant in Five Village, said when talking about the role of poor peasants in the agricultural cooperation movement: "Poor peasants lack cattle and farm tools, and need cooperation and mutual assistance the most. Poor peasants have contributed to various revolutionary struggles in the past, and this time they must play a leading role in establishing cooperatives, and we must unite well with the middle peasants." Wen Cunqi, a middle peasant, initially believed that the poor peasants lacked cattle and farm tools, and did not sell as much grain as the middle peasants, so he was very dissatisfied with the poor peasants. After studying and discussing the consistent performance of the poor and middle peasants in the village in their work, Wen Cunqi realized: "From land reform to the state monopoly of purchase and marketing, the poor peasants have performed well everywhere and have always been at the forefront of everything. The middle peasants often look forward and backward, always putting the word 'I' first. The middle peasants can't do anything without relying on the poor peasants!" Wu Dehua compared the relationship between poor and middle peasants to bones and flesh, eyebrows and eyes, saying: "The eyes blink and the eyebrows move, and there is flesh and the bones are hard. Only when the poor peasants and the middle peasants unite can the power be greater and can we fight against the rich peasants." Li Zecheng, a poor peasant, used the facts of the sabotage activities carried out by the rich peasants in the village to illustrate that without restricting the rich peasants, the middle peasants could not be well united. He said: "If we don't restrict the rich peasants, the middle peasants will follow the rich peasants. Only by blocking the capitalist road of the rich peasants can the middle peasants easily move towards the socialist road!"

    After the cadres and the masses understood the Party's class policy, they changed their past understanding. The cadres of Five Village re-admitted more than a dozen poor peasant households who had been screened out on the pretext of having some "minor problems." After joining the cooperative, Zeng Xiaoquan, a poor peasant in Two Village, actively mobilized middle peasants to join the cooperative. Of the 196 households in the village, 167 households signed up to join the cooperative. The middle peasants also eliminated their ideological concerns and dissatisfaction, and actively participated in the cooperation movement. Song Deshan, a middle peasant in Sixteen Village, etc., were very uneasy when they first heard that cattle and farm tools had to be put into the cooperative. They said to people everywhere: "People rely on the poor peasants, but we middle peasants have no say." Later, he understood the Party's class policy and saw that the agricultural cooperative reasonably solved the problem of cattle and farm tools entering the cooperative. So the whole family immediately took their land certificates, put on new clothes, and went to the agricultural cooperative to sign up together. The Party branch paid great attention to the training and selection of leading cadres for the newly established cooperatives, thus ensuring the leading advantage of the poor peasants in the organization of the agricultural cooperatives. At the same time, middle peasants were also absorbed into the leadership of the agricultural cooperatives. Now, of the 46 directors of agricultural cooperatives in the township, poor peasants account for 72 percent.

    In establishing cooperatives, landlords and rich peasants used despicable means such as spreading rumors, sabotage, and attracting and buying over the masses to obstruct the peasants from joining agricultural cooperatives. The landlord Guo Runhua scattered broken glass on the ridges of the fields, piercing the feet of the masses who were producing in the fields barefoot. The rich peasant Li Kunshan used 500,000 yuan to attract and bribe peasants; and secretly encouraged the "private plots" to be left in the middle of the large area of land in the agricultural cooperative, undermining the unified management of the cooperative. The rich peasant Nie Zhonghua spread rumors that "property will be confiscated after joining the cooperative" to prevent the masses from joining the cooperative. After the Party branch discovered these sabotage activities, it used various occasions to carry out publicity, exposing the various sabotage activities of the landlords and rich peasants; at the same time, it also organized the deceived peasants to expose the conspiracies of the landlords and rich peasants. In addition, the county people's court also sentenced the lawless landlords and rich peasants who carried out sabotage activities to control and imprisonment respectively according to the demands of the masses.

    IV

    At the beginning of the establishment of cooperatives, the branch put forward the slogan "Do a good job in production and welcome the establishment of cooperatives," making the process of establishing cooperatives a process of organizing the masses for production. In the early days of the establishment of cooperatives, the branch paid attention to leadership, so that the work of establishing cooperatives would not delay agricultural activities such as weeding, hoeing, and accumulating fertilizer. In the later stage of establishing cooperatives, the township branch, according to the instructions of the CCP Sichuan Provincial Committee, led each cooperative to formulate plans for autumn harvesting, autumn planting, and planting a season of short-term crops. Due to the reasonable organization of labor and the unified harvesting and cultivation, the township completed the autumn harvest ahead of schedule and increased the planting of late autumn crops by more than 12,800 mu, enabling the township to obtain a third bumper harvest after the summer and autumn harvests, fully demonstrating the superiority of agricultural cooperation. At the same time as establishing cooperatives, a credit cooperative was also established. As soon as the credit cooperative was established, it launched credit business in conjunction with production, lending 18 million yuan to each agricultural cooperative, solving the difficulties of cattle and investment for each agricultural cooperative.

    In order to adapt to the new situation of cooperative development and strengthen the Party's leadership over agricultural cooperatives, in addition to establishing a township agricultural production cooperation committee, the Party also developed Party organizations in the newly established cooperatives.

    中共禾登乡支部在建社中的领导作用
    本报记者　纪希晨
    四川省新繁县禾登乡在秋前大规模建社中，党支部发挥了核心领导作用，坚持了说服、教育方针，深入地发动了群众，在近两个月内，除有一个老社扩大外，新建立了四十四个新社。全乡十六个村，已达到了村村有社。入社农户占全乡农业总户数的百分之七十八，入社土地达耕地总面积的百分之七十四。全乡基本上已经合作化了。
    一
    一年多来，禾登乡经过总路线和统购统销的宣传，特别是全国人民代表大会代表罗世发领导的新民农业生产合作社所显示的生产优越性的影响，全乡农民互助合作积极性高涨起来，成群结队地到新民农业生产合作社参观访问，许多农民关切地对罗世发说：“你们社的门是开的？还是关的？”“你们能不能在我们村建立一个分社？”有的当场掏出土地证说，“从去年盼到今年，这回说啥也要入社哩！”
    面对着互助合作运动中出现的这种新情势，中共禾登乡支部，根据上级党委指示，在去年七月间召开了全乡党员大会，讨论建社问题。大量发展新社呢？还是继续搞一个重点老社呢？会上展开了争论。有的人强调“稳步发展”、“慢慢来”，让要求入社的群众暂时在社外“站一站”，理由是“树大要出桠，儿大要分家”，怕办多了生麻烦，怕办坏了要负责任。另有一些人则忽视了建社中的困难，表现盲目乐观，说：“建社有啥难？只要上级有命令，开个群众大会，一个动员号召，保证百分之百！”支部组织大家学习了党中央有关互助合作的政策文件。在学习讨论中，大家批判了退缩不前和急躁冒进两种情绪，统一了党内的思想，大家认识到在领导农业合作化运动中，必须坚持“积极领导，稳步前进”的发展方针，和遵守耐心说服、自愿入社的建社原则。同时支部并引导大家分析了建社的有利条件。如：全乡互助合作基础较强（全乡组织起来的农户已达百分之八十七）；领导骨干较多（有三十五个党员，一百多个青年团员，每村还有八九个积极分子）；会计人员也不缺乏等等。只要很好地运用这些条件，耐心说服教育群众，大量发展农业社是完全可能的。支部书记兼乡长的黄静仙说：“如果再不建社，我们就会落在群众的后面。只要全党动员，贯彻党的阶级路线，我们一定能把全乡农民领导到合作化道路上来！”
    党员大会通过建社计划以后，支部就积极地训练建社骨干。建社前，全乡开办了一期二百六十人的建社训练班。这些人中有共产党员、青年团支部委员、老社骨干和准备培养为农业社正副社主任的积极分子。除学习党的有关互助合作政策特别是农村阶级政策外，老社干部还向大家介绍了办社的具体经验。这就使建社骨干从政策思想和具体作法上武装起来。大家普遍反映：“有原则，有办法，办社有了本钱！”学习回去以后，纷纷组织起建社筹备委员会，积极进行建社筹备工作。后来又召开了全乡人民代表会议和全乡互助合作代表大会，继续深入地进行社会主义教育，把广大积极分子吸收到建社工作中来。支部为帮助各村开展建社工作，除支部委员具体分工进行领导外，还从老社中抽出一批骨干，经常到各村去帮助工作。
    二
    建社开始后，有些群众说：“社会主义来了，随潮流走吧！”十六村干部杨国民向农民说：“谁现在不入社，以后永辈子不叫他入社！”党支部发现了干部和群众的这种情绪，认为思想发动工作做的还不深不透，随即在全乡展开了大规模的宣传活动。各村除普遍召开三四次群众大会外，各建社单位还分别召集老农、青年、妇女、贫农、中农有牛户等举行座谈，通过回忆和对比，结合具体实例，总结互助合作运动给农民带来的好处，针对各种人不同情况，采用“一把钥匙开一把锁”的方法，具体解除群众的思想顾虑。东林村有些人怀疑合作社人多，怕增不了产，党小组就以夏收中新民一分社每亩菜籽收一百三十九斤，洪兴互助组收一百二十七斤，单干农民徐继良每亩才收一百零二斤的事实，说明只有土地统一经营和劳力统一使用，才能更多的增加生产。大家说：“单干不如互助组，互助组不如农业社，要发展生产只有加入农业社！”全村百分之九十的农户报名入了社。十三村中农冉兴汝，误认为入了社会“明不扯平暗扯平”，不愿入社，后来当他知道了新民农业社“多劳多得”的原则后，便报名入了社。六村的妇女，顾虑入社以后，评工分时吃亏，同时又怕吃菜、烧柴、喂猪不方便，经过共产党员冯三娘挨户宣传解释，说明社里实行男女“同工同酬”，每户社员还可以留地种菜以后，大家都欢欢喜喜地入了社。在大家自愿报名入社的基础上，党小组又引导群众讨论入社的条件，结合宣传和座谈，在群众中广泛地展开了个别串连工作。民主村青年团支部委员杨廷，在村里通过和群众个别交谈，说服了二十多户农民自愿组织起农业社。八村贫农冉四时，串连了十五户贫农和十二户中农成立了农业社。
    当思想动员基本成熟以后，支部就领导群众转入具体问题的讨论。在有利生产、照顾群众习惯、平等互利、公平合理的原则下，经过民主讨论，合理地解决了土地、耕牛、农具、肥料、种籽、水碾等的入股和分配问题。由于在一切方面都贯彻了互利原则，因之便进一步巩固了贫农和中农在农业社的经济联盟，从而也就巩固了农业社。中农黄三河便说：“照这样公公道道，两不吃亏，农业社不用喊我也要进去。”
    三
    建社初期，许多党员和建社骨干对依靠贫农
  （包括全部原来是贫农的新中农），巩固地团结中农，限制和逐步消灭富农经济这一阶级政策的认识还很模糊。有的人忽视依靠贫农，怕提出依靠贫农，会“得罪”中农；有的小看中农，认为团结中农是“可有可无”的事情，不用团结，中农也会跟贫农走。对富农则丧失了警惕，轻视富农的破坏作用，说：“他们成不了啥气候。”针对这种情况，党支部首先在党员大会、乡人民代表会和建社骨干中，进行了关于阶级路线的教育，使大家从政策知识和实际生活中，认识到只有中农贫农团结起来，才能孤立富农限制富农剥削。五村贫农邱荣武谈到贫农在农业合作化运动中的作用时说：“贫农缺乏耕牛、农具，最需要合作互助。贫农过去在各种革命斗争中都出了力气，这次在建社中也要起带头作用，要很好地团结中农。”中农温存齐起初认为贫农缺乏耕牛、农具，卖粮又没有中农卖的多，因此对贫农很不服气。经过学习讨论本村贫农和中农在工作中的一贯表现以后，温存齐认识到：“从土地改革到统购统销，贫农处处表现得好，事事都跑在前面。中农常常观前望后，处处把‘我’字放在前头，中农不依靠贫农啥事也办不成！”吴德华更把贫农和中农的关系比作了骨和肉、眉毛和眼睛，他说：“眼眨眉毛动，有肉骨头硬，只有贫农和中农团结起来，力量才更大，才能跟富农作斗争。”贫农李泽成用富农在村里进行破坏活动的事实，说明不限制富农就不能很好的团结中农，他说：“不限制富农，中农就要跟着富农跑。只有把富农的资本主义道路堵住，中农才容易向社会主义路上走！”
    干部和群众了解党的阶级政策以后，都改变了过去的认识，五村干部把原来曾借口有某些“小毛病”，而被审查掉了的十多户贫农，都又重新吸收入社。二村贫农曾孝全自己入社以后，又积极发动中农入社，全村一百九十六户中有一百六十七户报名入了社。中农也消除了思想顾虑和不满情绪，积极参加合作化运动。十六村中农宋德山等初听到耕牛、农具要入社时，情绪很不安，到处对人说：
  “人家依靠贫农，咱们中农可没眼无名啦。”后来他了解了党的阶级政策，看到农业社合理地解决了耕牛农具入社问题。于是全家人马上带着土地证，穿着新衣服，一齐到农业社去报名。党支部非常注意对新建社领导骨干的培养和选择，因而在农业社的组织上保证了贫农的领导优势。同时也吸收中农参加了对农业社的领导。现在全乡农业社的四十六个社主任中，贫农占到百分之七十二。
    建社中，地主富农用造谣、暗害、拉拢和收买群众等卑鄙手段，阻挠农民群众加入农业社。地主郭润华把碎玻璃撒在田坎路畔上，刺破了赤脚下田生产的群众。富农李坤三以五十万元拉拢贿赂农民；并暗暗怂恿把“自留地”留在农业社大片土地的当中，破坏合作社的统一经营。富农聂仲华造谣说：“财产入了社就要充公”，阻止群众入社。党支部发现这些破坏活动以后，便利用各种场合进行宣传，揭穿地主富农的各种破坏活动；同时还组织被欺骗的农民揭发地主富农的阴谋。此外，县人民法庭并根据群众要求，对进行破坏活动的不法地主和富农分别判处管制和徒刑。
    四
    建社一开始，支部就提出“搞好生产，迎接建社”的口号，使建社过程变成了组织群众生产的过程。建社初期，支部注意领导，使建社工作不能耽误薅秧、锄草、积肥等农事活动。建社后期，乡支部根据中共四川省委指示，又领导各社普遍制订了秋收、秋种和多种一季短期作物的计划。由于合理组织劳动力，统一收获和耕作，全乡提前完成秋收，增种了晚秋作物一万二千八百余亩，使全乡继夏收秋收之后，又获得了第三次丰收，充分的显示了农业合作化的优越性。和建社同时，还建立了一个信用合作社。信用合作社一成立便结合生产展开信贷业务，为各农业社贷款一千八百万元，解决了各农业社耕牛和投资的困难。
    党支部为适应合作化发展的新形势加强党对农业社的领导，除建立了乡的农业生产合作委员会外，还在新建社中发展了党的组织。
