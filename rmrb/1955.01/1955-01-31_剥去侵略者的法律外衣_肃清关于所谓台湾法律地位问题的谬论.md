Stripping Away the Legal Cloak of Aggressors
——Eradicating the Fallacies Concerning the So-Called Legal Status of Taiwan
Mei Rǔ'áo

Former Judge of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East

Aggression is a serious crime under international law. Since the end of World War II, after the two major trials of Nuremberg and the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, aggression has been recognized as humanity's "supreme crime." The tragic fate of Hitler, Goering, Tojo, Itagaki, and other major Nazi German and Fascist Japanese aggressors is well known.

Precisely because of this, after World War II, elements of the American imperialist and warmongering clique became even more cunning and deceitful. In every act of aggression, they try to put on a legal cloak, attempting to make their naked aggression appear legal, even just, under the cover of this cloak.

American imperialists are still using their old tricks in their current aggression against Taiwan, using a cloak to conceal their aggressive behavior. The whole world knows that Taiwan is the sacred territory of China and an inseparable part of Chinese territory. But American imperialists insist on occupying Taiwan, obstructing the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, and separating Taiwan from China, in order to maintain Taiwan as their "unsinkable aircraft carrier" in the Pacific and their military base for attacking the Chinese mainland. This action undoubtedly infringes upon China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and interferes in China's internal affairs, constituting an outright act of aggression under international law.

In order to conceal this act of aggression, the American ruling clique and its accomplices, especially British politicians and propagandists eager to curry favor with the United States, have been trying to find or create a legal cloak for the United States. Since June 27, 1950, just two days after the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea, when President Truman announced the so-called "neutralization of Taiwan" and stated that "the future status of Taiwan must await the restoration of Pacific security, the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, or consideration by the United Nations," and especially after U.S. Secretary of State Dulles declared on November 16 last year that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands have a so-called "special legal status" and "obvious international status," and after the signing of the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" on December 2, British and American politicians and propagandists have been clamoring endlessly about the legal status of Taiwan, fabricating all kinds of strange and absurd "arguments" and "views," attempting to make people believe that Taiwan is not Chinese territory, or at least that the statement "Taiwan is Chinese territory" is legally problematic. Thus, the American actions on Taiwan do not constitute aggression against China's territorial sovereignty. Sometimes, these politicians and propagandists even pretend to be compassionate and peace-loving, saying that in order to ease international tensions and maintain lasting peace in the Far East, the best way is to "neutralize" Taiwan, or put it under UN "trusteeship," or make Taiwan an "independent country," or recognize two "Chinas" that do not infringe upon each other. These fallacies, when exposed, are all vicious conspiracies serving American aggressors. They know that if American aggressors put on such a cloak, their true aggressive face will be more difficult to recognize, and their goals of dividing Chinese territory, interfering in China's internal affairs, and preventing the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan will be more easily achieved. American aggressors understand very well: whether it is placing Taiwan under UN "trusteeship," "neutralizing" it, making it an "independent country," or creating "two Chinas," in fact, Taiwan will inevitably be controlled by them continuously, preventing it from falling into the hands of the Chinese people; therefore, they are very "interested" in these "suggestions" and "methods." The American aggression group will not insist on any particular type of cloak as long as it can achieve its aggressive goals.

However, the Chinese people are not at all interested in these "methods" and "suggestions"! On the contrary, we only feel disgust and indignation towards these absurd and outrageous strange theories, because they are all based on denying China's sovereignty over Taiwan, and China's sovereignty over Taiwan is absolutely undeniable. We have a 100% reason to prove that both legally and factually, Taiwan is China's sacred territory. Any aggression against China's sacred territory will inevitably be resisted and countered by the Chinese people.

To naked aggression, we must give naked resistance and counterattack. To aggression cloaked in a legal garment, we must first strip away that garment, exposing its true form and ugly appearance. This is the reason why we are here to expose and refute those fallacies currently popular regarding the legal status of Taiwan from a purely legal perspective.

The currently popular fallacies, though varied in their expressions and forms, almost all start from the same point, and their "central argument" is only one: to deny the legal effect of the "Cairo Declaration," saying that the "Cairo Declaration" is not a binding international document, so the provision in that declaration to "return Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to China" is legally problematic, and China cannot claim Taiwan as its own territory based on this declaration. British and American politicians and propagandists, like "one dog barking at the sun and a pack barking along," repeatedly clamor to develop this "argument." In their view, this "argument" is the most "powerful" and "satisfying."

This "powerful" and "satisfying" "argument," as they see it, is not worth refuting in the eyes of anyone with a little knowledge of international law. Their bringing out such an absurd and laughable argument as a legal cloak to cover up the crime of American occupation of Taiwan is like a drowning man grabbing at a straw to save his life. This indicates that they have reached the point that the Chinese call "黔驴技穷" (Qian donkey's tricks are exhausted).

Here, we can first point out: although the various currently popular fallacies all attempt to deny China's current sovereignty over Taiwan, no one has dared to deny that before the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 and the signing of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, Taiwan had always been Chinese territory. This is of course because the fact is too obvious, leaving no room for obliteration. History records that as early as the third century AD, Chinese people had been to Taiwan; by the early ninth century, trade between China and Taiwan and Penghu was quite developed, and Chinese people began to migrate to Taiwan in large numbers, which continued thereafter. By the thirteenth century, the Chinese government established a "Patrol Inspectorate" in Taiwan as a local government to administer Taiwan. In the Qing Dynasty, the Patrol Inspectorate was changed to "Taiwan Prefecture," under the control of Fujian Province, and later changed to "Taiwan Province," directly under the central government. Before the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, China had established effective sovereignty over Taiwan for hundreds of years. Of Taiwan's approximately eight million residents, 97% are Han Chinese, most of whom migrated from Fujian and Guangdong provinces. They speak "Minnan dialect" and "Hakka dialect" (two Chinese dialects); their culture is purely Chinese culture. Therefore, whether from a political, ethnic, or cultural perspective, Taiwan has always been Chinese territory, which is absolutely undeniable and has never been questioned.

After the end of the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, when China was forced to sign the Treaty of Shimonoseki, Taiwan was forcibly occupied by Japanese aggressors for fifty years. During that time, China's exercise of sovereignty over Taiwan was undoubtedly interrupted. However, during these fifty years, the heroic struggle of the Taiwanese people against foreign rule and to return to the motherland continued one after another, never interrupted. They launched as many as twenty armed uprisings, sacrificing more than 500,000 lives. Therefore, the "White Paper on United States Relations with China" published by the U.S. Department of State in August 1949 had to admit: "The people of Taiwan, under alien rule for 50 years, therefore welcomed Chinese liberation. During the Japanese occupation, the greatest hope of the people of Taiwan was to return to their mother country."

Everyone knows that World War II ended with Japan's unconditional surrender. As one of the victorious countries, China naturally had the right to recover the territory it had lost from the defeated country, just as France recovered the territories of Alsace and Lorraine from Germany after World War I, which it had lost for nearly fifty years. This is the most basic and minimum right that a victorious country should exercise. The exercise of this right is fully in line with the needs of justice and fairness. It is not only affirmed by international law and practice but also conforms to the principles of domestic private law in various countries around the world. For example, if a thief is caught by the owner or the police, the stolen goods in his possession must of course be returned to the owner of the stolen goods. No court in the world would rule to give the stolen goods to a third party or declare them to be ownerless. The Anglo-American legal system is particularly serious about the principle of "returning property to its owner." Even if the stolen goods have been sold and bought multiple times, and the current holder is an innocent third party who paid the price and is completely unaware of the improper source of the item, he still has to return it respectfully when he meets the original owner. Any rights acquired by a third party over stolen goods cannot prevail against the original owner. This is a particularly strict and prominent principle in Anglo-American law regarding "returning property to its owner." Here, we have no intention of discussing or criticizing this principle. What we find laughable is that almost all those who are now clamoring that Taiwan should not be returned to China, and that Taiwan should be neutralized, placed under UN trusteeship, etc., are British and American politicians. They should not pretend to be completely ignorant of their own country's laws!

China had the right to recover Taiwan after Japan's surrender, and Japan had the obligation to return Taiwan, based on such a basic principle recognized by international law and domestic law. China suffered greatly during the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, sacrificing more than ten million lives and losing property worth hundreds of billions of dollars, with the aim of catching that thief, Japan. Since the thief has been captured, China of course has the right to order him to return the stolen goods he held in his hands, which he stole from China. This is legal principle and common sense. May I ask: Would any country in the world not recover the territory it had been stolen and occupied for fifty years after the enemy's unconditional surrender? Would it not liberate the compatriots on that territory who had been enslaved and trampled on by the defeated country for fifty years and longed to return to the motherland? I think that even the most stupid person would not have such an idea! There has never been such a precedent in history.

China's recovery of Taiwan is its inherent right as a victorious country, and no third party can deny or deprive it of this right.

China's determination to exercise this right was announced to the world as early as 1941. Here, we must remind everyone to pay attention to a very important fact: on December 8, 1941, when China officially declared war on Japan, China also solemnly announced that all treaties between China and Japan were abolished. Japan's occupation of Taiwan was based on the Treaty of Shimonoseki; since the Treaty of Shimonoseki was among those abolished, Japan's rule over Taiwan lost its basis from that day onwards. Of course, during the war against Japan, Taiwan was still under Japanese occupation in fact, but from a legal point of view, China had every right to consider that it had restored sovereignty over Taiwan from that day onwards.

The victory in the war against Japan guaranteed that China could implement that declaration of December 8, 1941. The Chinese authorities' acceptance of surrender in Taiwan on October 25, 1945, and the declaration that "from today onwards, Taiwan and the Penghu Islands officially rejoin the territory of China" was only a practical action to implement China's own declaration. In fact, from that day onwards, Taiwan had been returned to China.

The "Cairo Declaration" signed by China, the United States, and Britain on December 1, 1943, confirmed a part of the goals that China had resolved to implement in its 1941 declaration and reiterated the inherent rights that China, as a country declaring war on Japan, should enjoy under international law. The declaration stated: "The purpose of the Three Powers...is that all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese, such as Manchuria, Taiwan, and the Penghu Islands, shall be restored to the Republic of China." Former U.S. President Roosevelt (one of the signatories of the Cairo Declaration) correctly explained this declaration in a radio address on December 24, 1943: "These principles are both simple and basic. They include returning stolen property to its rightful owner."

The role of the Cairo Declaration, for China, was only to affirm and state in black and white the rights that China should enjoy based on those "simple and basic" principles of international law, and to ensure, with the guarantees of Britain and the United States, that these rights would be respected and exercised, because the declaration clearly stated that this was "the purpose of the Three Powers." From the Chinese perspective, the importance of the Cairo Declaration is such, and only such.

From a legal point of view, the Cairo Declaration is entirely "declaratory." It only declares existing legal principles and states existing rights and obligations. It does not create any new legal principles or establish any new rights and obligations itself. China did not obtain any rights in the Cairo Declaration that it should not have obtained under international law. Without the Cairo Declaration, China could still exercise these rights, including the right to make Japan "return stolen property to its rightful owner." Needless to say, the rightful owner of Taiwan is China. China's recovery of Taiwan and the return of Taiwanese compatriots to the motherland is the result of China's victory in the war against Japan, bought with the blood and sweat of the Chinese people, and is by no means a gift or favor from Roosevelt or Churchill.

Now British and American politicians and propagandists deliberately pretend not to understand the rights that China should have under international law, pretend not to see China's declaration of abolishing all Sino-Japanese treaties issued in 1941, pretend not to know that the clause of the Cairo Declaration concerning the return of Chinese territory has been implemented for nearly ten years, and are still talking endlessly and happily about the legal effect of the Cairo Declaration, obviously attempting to deny China's territorial sovereignty over Taiwan by shaking the legal effect of the Cairo Declaration, thereby exonerating American imperialists from the crime of occupying Taiwan and paving the way for future conspiracies such as Taiwan's "neutralization," "UN trusteeship," and "independence."

Because these gentlemen are barking madly around the issue of the validity of the Cairo Declaration, it forces us to waste some more time and discuss with them the issue of the legal effect of the declaration itself, that is, the issue of its binding force.

We have repeatedly pointed out earlier that the Cairo Declaration is not the main basis for China's recovery of Taiwan, let alone the only basis. But this does not mean that the Cairo Declaration is not a binding international document. On the contrary, the Cairo Declaration is a solemn document solemnly signed and announced to the world by China, the United States, and Britain through their heads of state or highest administrative authorities at that time, and its legal binding force is undeniable. The declaration not only stipulated that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands should be returned to China but also stipulated that Manchuria (the northeastern provinces of China) should be returned to China and guaranteed Korea's independence. Do those gentlemen who wrongly think that they can deny China's sovereignty over Taiwan by lightly saying that the Cairo Declaration is not binding have thought that, according to their logic, Korea's independence should be revoked? And that Manchuria is no longer Chinese territory? What an absurd idea! Are they planning to create two more legal cloaks for their masters for the future occupation of Manchuria and Korea?

Here, we must also tell those gentlemen: the Cairo Declaration has been combined with the "Potsdam Proclamation" of July 26, 1945, by the four countries of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, and the "Surrender Terms" signed by the nine countries of China, the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, Australia, Canada, France, the Netherlands, and New Zealand with Japan on September 2 of the same year, and constitutes an inseparable part of those two documents. The "Potsdam Proclamation" states that "the terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be implemented," and Article 1 of the Japanese "Surrender Terms" stipulates that Japan "accepts the provisions of the Potsdam Proclamation." These three documents are so closely linked that if one is to be denied, the other two cannot but be denied. We want to tell those who deny the binding force of the Cairo Declaration: you must also deny the binding force of the Potsdam Proclamation and the Japanese Surrender Terms. In this way, Japan's surrender becomes invalid, and the six-year American occupation of Japan becomes illegal. The absurd consequences that your fallacies may produce are beyond your expectations!

We fully understand the shameful motives of these politicians and propagandists for denying the validity of the Cairo Declaration, but we have been unable to understand what legal reasons they hold and what shortcomings the Cairo Declaration has as an international document, and they themselves have never made it clear. We guess that they may think that the Cairo Declaration does not use the name and form of a treaty, so it does not have the effect of a treaty. This is too ignorant of treaties. Everyone knows that a document with treaty effect can use a variety of names and forms, such as treaty, convention, agreement, protocol, declaration, proclamation, etc., and "declaration" is often used. Whether an international document is binding is a substantive issue, not an issue of name or form. They may say that the Cairo Declaration has not gone through the ratification process, so it cannot constitute a valid treaty. This statement is also pretending to be naive and making trouble without reason. Since the document does not stipulate that it shall take effect only after ratification, ratification is not necessary. At the same time, whether a document needs ratification is a domestic issue, the responsibility of the signatory, and has nothing to do with the effectiveness of the document. If the signatory of the document has illegal and unauthorized behavior, he will be held accountable domestically, and even impeached and removed. However, U.S. President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill, who represented the United States and Britain in signing the Cairo Declaration, did not have any responsibility issues at home; and there have never been any objections to the Cairo Declaration in the United States and Britain. It is extremely naive and ridiculous to say that a document cannot become an effective international document without the ratification process. There are many international documents that have not been ratified, countless. Apart from other things, even the infamous "Xinyou Treaty" (also known as the "Beijing Protocol" of 1900) has not been ratified by Britain and the United States. However, it is one of the main tools for imperialist powers to invade China; under that treaty, they extracted huge amounts of compensation from China and obtained many privileges. During the more than forty years of its implementation, no one has ever raised the issue of its effectiveness.

Undoubtedly, the Cairo Declaration is a solemn and binding international document, although China's recovery of Manchuria and Taiwan does not rely on this document.

The terms of the Cairo Declaration have been realized. At this time, there are still people who want to deny its effectiveness, and even erase its existence. Their ill intentions are self-evident.

The London "Times" said on September 6, 1954:
"London has never regarded the Cairo Declaration as something binding in international law. It is merely a declaration of intent." It also said:
"In 1951, when Taiwan seceded from Japan according to the peace treaty, in the eyes of the British, the island had become a vacuum, belonging to no one, just like its current status." This statement by The Times is a bizarre and contradictory fallacy. We want to tell them: Any "declaration" is an expression of "intent," but once it is signed and published by the contracting states, it becomes a "binding thing," and the Cairo Declaration is such a "thing." We also want to tell them: China did not sign the so-called "peace treaty" of 1951, and any terms in that "peace treaty" that harm China's interests are illegal and invalid for China. In fact, although that "peace treaty" only stipulated that Japan abandon Taiwan, it did not stipulate that Taiwan should not be returned to China or should be occupied by a third party. Due to the constraints of the "Surrender Terms," Japan has absolutely no right to sign any treaty that violates the "return of Taiwan to China." Britain is a signatory to the Cairo Declaration. In its eyes, Taiwan should not be "a vacuum" but should be Chinese territory that has been "returned to China." Finally, we also want to tell them: In fact, Taiwan's "current status" is not "a vacuum" but has been a sacred territory of China again since October 1945.

The statement made by British Deputy Foreign Minister Reading in the British House of Lords on December 20, 1954, in response to inquiries, is almost identical to that of The Times in terms of its bizarre nature and contradictions. Reading said: "There is currently no international document stipulating the status of Taiwan," which is obviously his deliberate erasure of the Cairo Declaration, while ignoring the Potsdam Proclamation and the Japanese Surrender Terms, and pretending not to know that China announced to the world its declaration of abolishing treaties with Japan when it declared war on Japan in 1941. Since these documents do not exist for Reading, he believes that "the status of Taiwan is a somewhat difficult status under international law." He also said: "Its exact status is a highly technical issue."

Reading is obviously pretending to be stupid, feigning confusion, and perhaps he himself does not know what he is saying. In order to serve the aggressors, Reading may have to work hard to do so. But since he is speaking on behalf of the British government, we cannot but expose the British authorities' violation of international obligations and breach of faith.

We do not need to make a great effort here. It is enough to quote a few paragraphs from what the British Foreign Office spokespersons have said before to remind them.

On November 21, 1949, the British Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs said in the British House of Commons: "According to the Cairo Declaration, the Chinese authorities took control of the island (Taiwan) at the time of Japan's surrender, and have since exercised control over the island."

On December 14, 1950, British Foreign Secretary Bevin said: "We have no reason to go back on our word and deny the Cairo Declaration."

On April 11, 1951, a British Foreign Office spokesperson said: "As for Taiwan, His Majesty's Government considers itself bound by the Cairo Declaration of 1943 and the Potsdam Proclamation of 1945 (which require the return of Taiwan to China)."

On August 25, 1954, a British Foreign Office spokesperson said: "The Cairo Declaration said that Taiwan should be returned to China, and this has been done."

We do not know what the reaction of Mr. Reading and the British government authorities will be after hearing these words. Let us quote a few more paragraphs from the words of the highest authorities and spokespersons of the U.S. government for them to listen to:

On January 5, 1950, former U.S. President Truman said: "For the past four years, the United States and other allies have recognized China's exercise of sovereignty over the island (Taiwan)." "Taiwan should be returned to China" "The United States has no intention of interfering in Taiwan" "The U.S. government does not want to follow any path that could involve it in the Chinese civil war."

The statement by the U.S. Secretary of State on January 5, 1950, said: "The Chinese have ruled Taiwan for four years. The United States or any other ally has never had any doubt about this power. When Taiwan was used as a province of China, no one has ever raised any legal difficulties. This move is considered to be in line with all the agreements."

On February 9, 1950, the U.S. Department of State further stated: "The President's statement of January 5, 1950, is the confirmation of the United States of America of the Cairo Declaration regarding the resolution of the Taiwan issue." "Since 1945, Taiwan has been managed by China. ... It has been included in China and become a province." "The allies who participated in the war against Japan have no doubts about these steps. The United States has no doubts about these steps either. ... In other words, the allies, including the United States, have believed for the past four years that Taiwan is part of China." "If the U.S. government hopes to establish ... a non-Chinese administrative authority in Taiwan, this would be considered by people on the Chinese mainland and throughout Asia as our government violating our obligations and contradicting our policy of always respecting China's territorial integrity."

We do not know what Mr. Reading, the British authorities, and those various propagandists and politicians in Britain and the United States will feel after reading these words spoken by the U.S. President and Secretary of State before the U.S. occupation of Taiwan. Can Mr. Reading honestly insist that there are no "international documents" regarding the status of Taiwan? Will he really feel that Taiwan's "exact status" is a "difficult" issue, a "highly technical" issue?

The facts are so simple and the law is so clear that I think anyone who is not "ill-intentioned" will agree with the following conclusion regarding the Taiwan issue: Taiwan has always been Chinese territory. It was stolen by Japan for fifty years. After the end of World War II, China exercised the inherent right granted to it under international law due to its victory in the war against Japan, and according to the declaration it issued on December 8, 1941, it took action on October 25, 1945, to return Taiwan to the motherland. China's action is completely legal. It not only conforms to the provisions of international documents such as the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation, and the Japanese Surrender Terms but is also guaranteed to be realized by those international documents. Since 1945, China has restored its sovereignty over Taiwan. Whether legally or factually, Taiwan has become part of China's sacred territory again since then.

This conclusion is extremely simple and extremely clear both legally and factually, and there will be no "difficulty" for anyone to understand or agree with it.

What is "difficult" is that the American aggressors, because they want to maintain Taiwan as their base of aggression, are now occupying this territory of China, and in order to make their occupation permanent and legal, they are also eager to find a legal basis to cover up their aggressive actions. This is of course an extremely "difficult" problem. It is indeed a "highly technical issue." It is a pity that these accomplices, the politicians and propagandists, although they have been racking their brains and scheming for a long time, causing public opinion circles in Britain and the United States to discuss and argue in a chaotic and smoggy atmosphere, they have never been able to solve this "problem." They can only go around and around the Cairo Declaration, wrongly thinking that as long as they can deny the validity of the Cairo Declaration, a beautiful legal cloak for the American aggressors will be successfully made.

However, the calculations of these poor politicians and propagandists are completely wrong! In this article, we have fully explained that the binding force of the Cairo Declaration cannot be denied! At the same time, we have repeatedly stated and emphasized that China's recovery of Taiwan is not based solely on the Cairo Declaration, and any attempt to deny China's sovereignty over Taiwan by shaking the Cairo Declaration is just a futile effort.

Taiwan is Chinese territory and an inseparable part of Chinese territory. Even the American "World Telegram and Sun" had to admit this. It said: "Taiwanese are Chinese, and the island is considered part of China, just as Florida is to the United States." Recently, Professor Boeffer, the editor of the American "Pacific Monthly," published an article discussing the American Taiwan policy. Even he admitted that the U.S. policy of long-term occupation of Taiwan by armed forces and preventing the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan is "not only a desperate idea but also a politically and militarily crazy idea."

The Chinese people are peace-loving. "We will not attack unless we are attacked" is the motto that the Chinese people have always believed in. As long as the U.S. government abandons its "desperate" and "crazy" idea, the tense situation in the Taiwan region can be eliminated immediately. If the U.S. ruling clique is obsessed with its own ways and insists on continuing its aggression against China, whether this aggression is naked or disguised, the Chinese people will resolutely resist and give it a severe counterattack. The Chinese people are extremely rich in experience in resisting aggression and repelling aggression. We do not believe that the fate of the warmongering elements of the American aggression clique will be more fortunate than the fate of the fascist Japanese or Nazi German aggressors. As for those who say that they advocate maintaining the status quo of the American occupation of Taiwan in order to ease the situation in the Far East, we should solemnly tell them that appeasing aggressors is encouraging aggression, and the result will only be to expand aggression and further endanger peace. Munich is the best historical lesson, and Mr. Chamberlain is their lesson!

    剥去侵略者的法律外衣
    ——肃清关于所谓台湾法律地位问题的谬论
    中国政治法律学会理事
    前远东国际军事法庭法官
    梅汝璈
    侵略是国际法上的严重罪行。自从二次世界大战结束、经过纽伦堡和远东国际军事法庭的两大审判之后，侵略已被确认为人类的“最大罪行”。希特勒、戈林、东条、坂垣等纳粹德国和法西斯日本的侵略巨魁的悲惨下场是众所周知的。
    正惟如此，所以在二次世界大战以后，美帝国主义侵略好战集团的分子们便变得更狡猾、更诡诈了。他们在每一个侵略行动中都设法要披上一件法律外衣，妄图在外衣的遮盖下，他们赤裸裸的侵略行动会被认为是合法的、甚至于是正义的。
    美国帝国主义者现在对台湾的侵略仍然是用它那一套旧把戏，用一件外衣去掩盖它的侵略行为。全世界都知道，台湾是中国的神圣领土，是中国领土不可分割的组成部分。但是美帝国主义者一定要霸占台湾，一定要阻挠中国人民解放台湾，一定要使台湾脱离中国，为的是它要保持台湾做它在太平洋上“不沉的航空母舰”和它进攻中国大陆的军事基地。这种行动无疑地是侵犯中国主权和领土完整并干涉中国的内政，它在国际法上构成不折不扣的侵略行为。
    为了要掩盖这种侵略行为，美国统治集团和它的帮凶们，特别是对美国求宠心切的英国政客和宣传家们，一直要想替美国寻找或制造一件法律外衣。从一九五○年六月二十七日美国发动侵朝战争方才两天、杜鲁门总统宣布所谓“台湾中立化”并且声明“台湾未来的地位必须等待太平洋安全的恢复，对日和约的缔结，或联合国的考虑”时起，特别是在去年十一月十六日美国国务卿杜勒斯宣称台湾和澎湖列岛具有一种所谓“特殊的法律地位”和“明显的国际地位”和十二月二日美蒋“共同防御条约”签字以后，英美的政客和宣传家们便哓哓不休地在那里就台湾的法律地位问题大事叫嚷，并制造各色各样、无奇不有的“论据”和“看法”，企图使人们相信台湾不是中国的领土，至少“台湾是中国的领土”的说法在法律上有问题，因而美国对台湾的行动并不构成对中国领土主权的侵略。有的时候，这些政客和宣传家们还故意装出一副悲天悯人、热爱和平的样子，说为了缓和国际紧张局势和维护远东持久和平，他们建议最好的办法是把台湾“中立化”，或者交联合国“托管”，或者使台湾成为“独立国”，或者承认两个互不侵犯的“中国”。这些谬论，拆穿了说，都是为美国侵略者服务的毒辣阴谋。他们知道，假使美国侵略者披上了这样一件外衣，它的真正的侵略面貌便更难于辨认，同时它割裂中国领土、干涉中国内政、阻止中国人民解放台湾的目的将可更顺利地达成。美国侵略者十分明白：无论是把台湾交联合国“托管”也好，
  “中立化”也好，“独立国”也好，“两个中国”也好，事实上台湾必然是由它继续控制，不使落于中国人民之手；因此，他们对这些“建议”和“办法”都很“感觉兴趣”。美国侵略集团只要能够达到它的侵略目的，对于穿一件什么样的外衣它是不会坚持成见的。
    然而中国人民对于这些“办法”和“建议”是丝毫不感兴趣的！相反地，我们对于这些荒谬绝伦的种种怪论只有感着厌恶和愤慨，因为它们都是建筑在否认中国对台湾的主权上的，而中国对台湾的主权是绝对不能否认的。我们有百分之百的理由证明无论在法律上或事实上台湾都是中国的神圣领土。任何对中国神圣领土的侵略必然会遭到中国人民的抵抗和回击。
    对赤裸裸的侵略，我们要给以赤裸裸的抵抗和回击。对披着一件法律外衣的侵略，我们还得先把它那件外衣剥去，使它原形毕露、丑态昭然。这便是我们在这里要纯本法律的见地对目前流行着的关于台湾法律地位问题的那些谬论加以揭穿和驳斥的原因。
    目前流行着的这些谬论，它们的说法虽是多种多样、形形色色，但是它们的出发点几乎都是一样，它们的“中心论据”只有一个，那便是：否定
  “开罗宣言”的法律效力，说“开罗宣言”不是一个具有拘束力的国际文件，所以那个宣言上规定把台湾、澎湖列岛“归还中国”在法律上是有问题的，中国不能根据这个宣言便认为台湾是它自己的领土。英美政客和宣传家们“一犬吠日、众犬吠声”般似地反复叫嚷着，便是要发挥这个“论据”。这个“论据”在他们看来是再“有力”再“得意”不过的了。
    这个他们自认为“得意”的“有力”的“论据”，在稍具国际法常识的人们看来，实在是不值一驳的。他们搬出这样荒谬可笑的论据来做掩盖美国侵占台湾罪行的法律外衣，就同溺在大海里的人抓住一根草救命一样。这表示他们已经到了中国人所谓“黔驴技穷”的地步。
    在这里，我们可以首先指出：目前流行的种种谬论虽都企图要否定中国现在对台湾的主权，但是还没有人敢于否认在中日甲午战争、马关条约签订之前，台湾一向是中国的领土。这当然是由于事实太明显，没有任何抹杀的余地。历史记载着：远在公元第三世纪，中国人便到过台湾；到了九世纪初叶，中国和台湾、澎湖的贸易往来已经相当发达，中国人并开始大量向台湾移殖，其后继续不断。到了十三世纪，中国政府在台湾设了“巡检司”作为地方政府，管辖台湾。到清朝，巡检司改为“台湾府”，属福建省节制，迄后又改为“台湾省”，直隶中央政府。在中日甲午之战以前，中国对台湾已经建立了好几百年的有效主权。台湾的约八百万居民之中，百分之九十七是汉人，他们极大多数是从福建、广东两省移殖去的。他们说的是“闽南话”和“客家话”（中国两种方言）；他们的文化纯粹是中国文化。所以，无论从政治、民族或文化上讲，台湾一向是中国的领土，那是绝对不容置疑而且从来没有人置疑过的。
    在一八九四至一八九五年的中日战争结束、中国被迫签订“马关条约”之后，台湾被日本侵略者强占了五十年之久，那时中国对台湾的主权行使无疑地是中断了。然而在这五十年中，台湾人民反抗异国统治、重返祖国的英勇斗争却是前仆后继，从未中断。他们的武装起义达二十次之多，牺牲的生命在五十万人以上。因此，一九四九年八月美国国务院所发表的“中美关系”白皮书里也不得不承认：“台湾人民受异族管辖达五十年，因之欢迎中国解放。在日本占领期中，台湾人民的最大希望是重归祖国。”
    大家都知道：二次世界大战是以日本无条件投降告终的。中国既是战胜国之一，它当然有权向战败国收复它所失去的领土，犹如第一次世界大战告终，法国向德国收复它失去了也将近五十年的阿尔萨斯、洛林两省的领土一样。这是战胜国当然要行使的最基本最起码的权利。这一权利的行使是完全符合正义与公平的需要的。它不但为国际公法和惯例所肯定，而且也符合世界各国国内私法的原则。譬如，一个窃盗被物主或警察捉到了，他手里所持的赃物当然要交还那件赃物的主人。世界上任何法院都不会判决把那件赃物交给第三者，或者判它为无主之物。英美法系对“物归原主”的原则是特别认真的。纵使那件被窃的赃物经过了多次的卖出买进，而现在的持有人是付了代价并且对于物件不正当的来源毫不知情的无辜的第三者，但是当他遇到原来的主人，他还是要拱手奉还的。任何第三者对于窃来品所取得的权利都不能对抗原来的所有人。这是英美法上对待“物归原主”特别严格的一个突出的原则。在这里，我们无意于讨论或批评这个原则。我们感觉可笑的只是现在叫嚷台湾不归还中国，以及台湾中立化，交联合国托管等等怪论的几乎全是英国和美国的政客。他们总不该装着对本国的法律懵然全无所知罢！
    中国在日本投降后有权利收复台湾，日本有义务送还台湾，根据的就是这样一个国际法和国内法所承认的基本原则。中国在八年抗日战争中受尽了苦难，牺牲了一千万人以上的生命，损失了价值几百亿美元以上的财产，目的就是为了要把那个窃盗——日本捉到。窃盗既已被擒，他手上所持有的窃自中国的赃物，中国当然有权命它交还。这是法理，也是常识。请问：世界上有任何国家在敌人无条件投降之后，会不向它收回被它窃取占据了五十年的领土吗？会不去解放在那块领土上被战败国奴役蹂躏了五十年而渴望重归祖国的同胞吗？我想，即使是愚蠢透顶的人也不会有这样的一个想法！历史上从来没有这样的先例。
    中国收复台湾是它作为战胜国所当然应有的权利，任何第三者都不能加以否认或剥夺的。
    中国决心要行使这个权利早在一九四一年便已经向全世界宣布了。在这里，我们要提醒大家注意一个极重要的事实，那便是：在一九四一年十二月八日中国正式宣布对日宣战的同时，中国还郑重宣布了中日间的一切条约作废。日本占领台湾所根据的是马关条约；马关条约既在被废之列，日本对台湾的统治自那天起便已失其凭借。诚然，在对日作战期间，事实上台湾仍在日本占领之下，但是从法理上讲，中国完全有权认为自那天起便已恢复了对台湾的主权。
    对日作战的胜利保证了中国能够把它一九四一年十二月八日的那个宣言付诸实施。一九四五年十月二十五日中国当局在台湾受降并宣布“从今日起，台湾及澎湖列岛正式重入中国版图”只不过是贯彻中国自己的宣言的一个实际行动而已。事实上，从这天起，台湾已经交还了中国。
    一九四三年十二月一日中、美、英三国所签署的“开罗宣言”确认了中国一九四一年宣言中所要决心贯彻的一部分目标，重申了中国作为对日宣战国家在国际法上所应享的当然权利。宣言说：“三国之宗旨……在使日本所窃取于中国的领土，如满洲、台湾、澎湖列岛等，归还中国。”美国前总统罗斯福（开罗宣言签字人之一）在一九四三年十二月二十四日的广播演说中解释这个宣言的时候很正确地说道：“这些原则既简单、又基本。其中包括归还偷盗的财产给当然的主人。”
    开罗宣言的作用，对中国说来，只是把中国根据国际法上那些“既简单又基本”的原则所应享的权利用白纸黑字肯定一下，申述一下，并由英美两国对这些权利的必被尊重和行使予以保证，因为宣言明白说明了这是“三国之宗旨”。从中国人看来，开罗宣言的重要性是如此，也仅仅是如此而已。
    从法律观点说，开罗宣言完全是“宣示性”的，它只是宣示一下现存的法律原则、申述一下已有的权利义务，它本身并未制造任何新的法律原则或创设任何新的权利义务。中国在开罗宣言中并没有得到任何它在国际法上所不应得到的权利。没有开罗宣言，中国依然是可以行使这些权利的，其中包括要使日本“归还偷盗的财产给当然的主人”的权利。不用说，台湾当然的主人就是中国。中国收复台湾、使台湾同胞得重返祖国是中国对日作战胜利的结果，是中国人民的头颅血汗所换来的，决不是罗斯福、邱吉尔的礼物或恩赐。
    现在英美的政客和宣传家们却故意装作不懂得中国在国际法上所应有的权利，装着不看见中国一九四一年所发表废除一切中日条约的宣言，装作不知道开罗宣言关于归还中国领土的条款已被执行了将达十年之久，而还在那里喋喋不休、乐此不疲地谈论着开罗宣言的法律效力问题，显然是妄想以动摇开罗宣言的法律效力去否定中国对台湾的领土主权，从而替美帝国主义者开脱侵占台湾的罪名，并为未来台湾“中立化”“联合国托管”“独立国”等阴谋铺平道路。
    由于这些先生们围绕着开罗宣言的效力问题狂吠不已，这就使我们不能不再浪费些时间，同他们谈谈这个宣言本身的法律效力问题，也就是它的拘束力的问题。
    我们在前面已经一再指出，开罗宣言不是中国收复台湾的主要根据，更不是唯一的根据。但这并不等于说开罗宣言不是具有拘束力的国际文件。相反地，开罗宣言是中、美、英三国通过它们当时的元首或最高行政当局所郑重签订并向全世界宣布了的庄严文件，它在法律上的拘束力是不容否认的。宣言上不但规定了台湾、澎湖列岛归还中国，还规定了满洲（中国东北诸省）归还中国，并且保证了朝鲜取得独立。那些妄以为轻飘飘地说一句开罗宣言没有拘束力便可以否定中国对台湾的主权的先生们，是否想到：照他们的逻辑，朝鲜的独立应该取消？而满洲也不是中国的领土了？这是多么荒谬绝伦的想法！他们是否打算替他们的主子制造另外两件为异日侵占满洲和朝鲜之用的法律外衣？
    在这里，我们还要告诉那些先生们：开罗宣言已经同一九四五年七月二十六日中、美、英、苏四国的“波茨坦公告”以及同年九月二日中、苏、英、美、澳、加、法、荷、新西兰九国同日本所签订的“投降条款”结合起来了而构成那两个文件中不可分割的部分。“波茨坦公告”说“开罗宣言之条件必将实施”，而日本“投降条款”第一条便规定了日本“接受波茨坦公告中的各条款”。这三个文件结合得如此密切，倘使要否定一个，便不能不否定其他两个。我们要告诉那些否认开罗宣言的拘束力的人们：你们还必须否认波茨坦公告和日本投降条款的拘束力。这样一来，日本投降便成为无效的，而美国对日本的六年占领便成为非法的了。你们的谬论所可能产生的这些荒唐后果是你们所意料不及的罢！
    我们对于这些政客和宣传家们否认开罗宣言效力的可耻动机是十分了解的，但是对于他们所持的法律理由究竟是什么，开罗宣言作为一个国际文件的缺点究竟在那里，却百思莫得其解，他们自己也从来没有明白说明过。我们猜测，他们或许是以为开罗宣言采用的不是条约的名称和形式，因而没有条约的效力。这未免装做得对条约太愚昧无知了。任何人都知道，一个具有条约效力的文件是可以采用多种多样的名称和形式的，如条约、公约、协定、协议、宣言、公告、议定书等等，而“宣言”还是常常采用的一种。一个国际文件有无拘束力是一个实质的问题，而不是名称或形式的问题。他们或许是说开罗宣言没有经过批准的手续，因而不能构成一个有效的条约。这种说法也是假装天真，无理取闹。文件上既没有规定须经批准方可生效，批准是不必需的。同时，一个文件需要不需要批准那是国内问题，签订人自己的责任问题，与文件的效力无关。倘使文件签订人有违法越权的行为，他会遭到国内的追究，甚至于弹劾、罢免。然而代表美国和英国签订开罗宣言的罗斯福总统和邱吉尔首相在国内并没有发生过责任问题；英美国内对开罗宣言也从来没有提出过任何异议。说未经批准手续便不成为有效的国际文件，那是极端幼稚可笑的。国际间未经批准的文件是很多的，数不胜数。别的且不说，就是那臭名远扬的“辛酉条约”（又名一九○○年“北京议定书”）也并未经英美各国批准。然而它是帝国主义列强侵略中国的主要工具之一；在那个条约下，他们从中国榨取了巨额赔款，获得了大量特权。在它实施的四十余年期间，从来没有任何人提出过它的效力问题。
    毫无疑义，开罗宣言是一个庄严的、具有拘束力的国际文件，虽然中国收复满洲、台湾依靠的并不是这个文件。
    开罗宣言的条款已经实现了。在这个时候，居然还有人想否认它的效力，甚至抹杀它的存在，其居心不良，不言而喻。
    一九五四年九月六日伦敦“泰晤士报”说：
  “伦敦从未把开罗宣言当作在国际法上具有拘束力的东西。它不过是一个关于意图的宣言。”又说：
  “在一九五一年当台湾根据和约而脱离日本时，在英国人眼中，该岛已成为一块真空，不属于任何人，正像它现在的地位一样。”泰晤士报的这个说法是光怪陆离、充满矛盾的谬论。我们要告诉他们：任何“宣言”都是一种“意图”的表现，但是它一旦经缔结国家签署公布之后，它便是一个“具有拘束力的东西”，而开罗宣言正是这样的一件“东西”。我们还要告诉他们：中国没有签署一九五一年的所谓“对日和约”，那个“和约”上任何有损中国权益的条款对中国都是非法的、无效的。事实上那个“和约”虽仅规定了日本放弃台湾，但它却也并未规定台湾不归还中国或应交第三者霸占。由于“投降条款”的拘束，日本绝对没有权利签订违反把台湾“归还中国”的任何条约。英国是开罗宣言的签字国，在它眼中台湾不应该是“一块真空”而应该是已经“归还中国”的中国领土。最后，我们还要告诉他们：事实上，台湾“现在的地位”并不是“一块真空”而是自一九四五年十月起便已重新成为一块中国的神圣领土了。
    一九五四年十二月二十日英国外交副大臣里丁在英国上议院答复质询时所作的声明，其持论之光怪陆离、矛盾迭见，几乎同泰晤士报的是一模一样。里丁说：“现在并不存在一项规定台湾地位的国际文件”，这显然是他故意抹杀开罗宣言，同时又忽视波茨坦公告、日本投降条款，更装着不知道有中国在一九四一年对日宣战时向世界所公布的对日废约宣言。由于这些文件对里丁都是不存在的，所以他认为“台湾的地位是一个在国际法上有些困难的地位”。他又说：“它的确切地位是一个高度技术性的问题。”
    里丁显然是装痴作傻，假充糊涂，只怕连他自己也不知道是在说些什么。为了要服务于侵略者，里丁或许不能不苦心孤诣地这样做作。但是他既是代表英国政府发言，我们对于英国当局们违反国际义务、背信弃义的行为便不能不加以揭露。
    我们用不着在这里大费气力，只要引下面几段英国外交部发言人以前所说过的话给他们回忆一下便够了。
    一九四九年十一月二十一日英国外交部次官在英国下议院说：“根据开罗宣言，中国当局在日本投降的时候对该岛（台湾）加以控制，并在此后一直行使着对该岛的控制。”
    一九五○年十二月十四日英国外交大臣贝文说：“我们没有理由自食其言，否认开罗宣言。”
    一九五一年四月十一日英国外交部发言人说：“至于台湾，陛下政府认为它自己受着一九四三年开罗宣言与一九四五年波茨坦公告（它们要求把台湾交还中国）的约束。”
    一九五四年八月二十五日英国外交部发言人说：“开罗宣言说，台湾应归还中国，这一点已经做到了。”
    我们不知道里丁先生和英国政府当局们听了这些话作何感想。让我们再引几段美国政府最高当局和发言人的话给他们听听：
    一九五○年一月五日美国前总统杜鲁门说：“过去四年来，美国及其他盟国承认中国对该岛（台湾）行使主权。”“台湾应该归还中国”“美国无意干涉台湾”“美国政府不欲遵循任何一个能够卷入中国内战的道路。”
    一九五○年一月五日美国国务卿的声明说：“中国人已统治台湾四年。美国或任何其他盟国从来未对该项权力发生过任何怀疑。当台湾被作为中国的一个省份的时候，没有任何人曾对此提出过任何法律上的疑难。此举经认为是符合各项约定的。”
    一九五○年二月九日美国国务院又声明说：“一九五○年一月五日总统的声明，乃美利坚合众国确认有关解决台湾问题的开罗宣言。”“自一九四五年起，台湾就已由中国管理。……它已包括在中国之内，成为一省。”“参加对日战争的各盟国对这些步骤并无疑义。美国对这些步骤也没有疑义。……换句话说，包括美国在内的各盟国在过去四年中认为台湾是中国的一部分。”“如果美国政府在台湾希冀建立……非中国的行政当局，这就会被中国大陆上以及全亚洲一切的人认为我们的政府违反了我们的义务，并与我们一向尊重中国领土完整的政策相矛盾。”
    我们不知道里丁先生、英国当局以及英国美国的那些形形色色的宣传家和政客们读了美国总统和国务卿的这些在美国侵占台湾以前所亲口说过的话又会发生什么感想。里丁先生能不能诚实地坚持说关于台湾地位没有任何“国际文件”的存在？他会不会真的感觉台湾的“确切地位”是一个“困难”的问题，是一个“高度技术性”的问题？
    事实是那样简单，法律是那样明显，我想只要不是“别有用心”的人对于台湾地位问题都会同意下面的这样一个结论：台湾一向是中国的领土，它被日本窃去了五十年。在第二次世界大战终结以后，中国行使了国际法上所赋予它由于对日作战胜利的当然权利，并根据它自己一九四一年十二月八日发布的宣言，在一九四五年十月二十五日已经采取了行动，把台湾收归了祖国。中国的这个行动是完全合法的，它不但符合开罗宣言、波茨坦公告、日本投降条款等国际文件的规定，而且正是那些国际文件所保证要使实现的。从一九四五年起，中国恢复了对台湾的主权。无论在法律上或事实上，台湾自那时起便又成了中国神圣领土的一部分。
    这个结论在法律上和事实上都是极端简单、极端明显的，任何人了解它、同意它都不会有什么
  “困难”。
    “困难”的是美国侵略者由于要保持台湾做它的侵略基地，现在侵占了中国的这块领土，为了要使它的侵占长久化、合法化，它还急于要找到一个法律根据做遮盖它侵略行动的外衣。这当然是一个极端“困难”的问题。它的确是一个“高度技术性的问题”。可怜的是这些帮凶的政客们和宣传家们虽然长期以来都在那里绞脑竭思、钩心斗角，弄得英国美国的舆论界议论纷纭、乌烟瘴气，他们却始终没有能够解决这个“问题”。他们只有围绕着开罗宣言兜来兜去，妄以为只要能够否认一下开罗宣言的效力，美国侵略者的一件美丽的法律外衣便算制作成功了。
    然而这班可怜的政客和宣传家们的算盘是完全打错了！在本文里，我们曾经充分说明了：开罗宣言的拘束力是不能否认的！同时，我们还反复申述、强调指出了：中国收回台湾根据的并不只是开罗宣言，任何要想以动摇开罗宣言的方式而否定中国对台湾主权的企图都只是枉费心机而已。
    台湾是中国的领土，是中国领土不可分割的组成部分。这连美国“世界电讯与太阳报”都不得不承认。它说：“台湾人是中国人，而且该岛之被人认为是中国之一部分，正如弗罗里达州之于美国一样。”最近还有一位美国“太平洋月刊”的编辑勃弗尔教授，发表了一篇讨论美国台湾政策的文章。连他都承认：美国用武装力量长期侵占台湾、阻止中国人民解放台湾的政策“不仅是一个绝望的主意，而且也是一个政治上和军事上疯狂的主意。”
    中国人是酷爱和平的。“人不犯我，我不犯人”是中国人一向所信奉的格言。只要美国政府放弃它的那个“绝望的”“疯狂的”主意，台湾地区的紧张局势马上就可消除。假使美国统治集团执迷不悟，坚持要继续它对中国的侵略，不论这种侵略是赤裸裸的或是乔装的，中国人民必然会坚决抵抗并予以严厉的回击。中国人民对于抵抗侵略和击退侵略的经验是极其丰富的。我们不相信美国侵略集团好战分子们的下场比法西斯日本或纳粹德国的侵略分子们的下场会更幸运。至于对于那些说是为了缓和远东局势而主张维持美国霸占台湾的现状的人，我们应该正告他们，对侵略者姑息就是鼓励侵略，其结果只有扩大侵略而进一步危害和平。慕尼黑是最好的历史教训，而张伯伦先生就是他们的前车之鉴！
