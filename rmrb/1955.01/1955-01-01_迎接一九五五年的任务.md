    Tasks for Welcoming 1955

    Today is New Year's Day, 1955. The year 1955 is of utmost importance to the people of our country. This year will be a year of struggle for the world's forces of peace to overcome the threat of a new war and defend peace, a year for the entire Chinese people to continue their struggle to liberate Taiwan, eliminate Chiang Kai-shek, and crush the U.S.-Chiang war treaty, and it will also be a year of decisive significance for the construction of our country's first Five-Year Plan.

    Our people, full of courage and confidence, are embarking on the third year of the construction of their motherland's first Five-Year Plan. Our people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, have already become the masters of the country, the masters of society, and the masters of history. We are fully capable of building our country into a prosperous and happy socialist society step by step through our own creative labor and in accordance with the laws of social development by implementing planned construction.

    The implementation of our national plan last year was successful. In 1954, industrial production and capital construction saw significant development. In this year, 300 major industrial construction projects were newly built, renovated, and continued. People saw many large-scale newly built factories such as the Anshan Iron and Steel Thin Plate Plant, the Taiyuan Electric Heating Plant, the Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Plant, and the Pneumatic Tool Plant; they also saw many renovated and expanded factories such as the Fushun Petroleum No. 2 Plant, the Fengman Hydropower Station, and the Yumen Oil Mine, which are beginning to produce for the needs of the country and the people. More than 700 kilometers of newly built railway lines were completed as planned, and the Kangzang and Qingzang highways have recently been officially opened to traffic. Although our country suffered floods unseen in nearly a century last year, the total grain output nationwide still increased by about 3 percent compared to the previous year. The rural cooperative movement has seen even greater development, with the number of agricultural producers' cooperatives nationwide increasing from 225,000 before the autumn harvest last year to more than 400,000. State-owned commerce, cooperative commerce, handicrafts, joint state-private enterprises, and private capitalist economies have also developed. On the basis of continuous development in production, the material and cultural living standards of the working people nationwide have been correspondingly improved. These achievements, as well as the experience we have gained in construction, give us full confidence in victory as we welcome this year's even greater tasks.

    Why is 1955 a year of decisive significance for the construction of our country's first Five-Year Plan? First of all, because this year's workload for capital construction will be far greater than in any previous year. The state's investment in capital construction will increase by more than 40 percent compared to last year. The backbone of our country's first Five-Year Plan—the 141 key projects that the Soviet government is helping our country to build—have already started construction, and this year will enter the most intense construction phase, and most of those that have not yet started construction will complete preparatory work this year. At the same time, the last two years of the Five-Year Plan will also complete about 50 percent of the workload for capital construction. If we fail to keep up with the progress this year and postpone the projects, it will seriously affect the completion of the capital construction plan in the latter two years.

    This year's economic work tasks are particularly heavy also because agricultural production, which is closely linked to industrial development, has suffered successive serious natural disasters. Although agricultural production is still rising thanks to the efforts of the People's Government and all farmers, it has not yet reached the original production increase targets, and the development of light industry and the supply of consumer goods to the people have also been restricted as a result. In order to overcome this situation, Party committees at all levels must make the greatest efforts this year to lead farmers to strive for greater production increases to make up for the losses caused by natural disasters in the previous two years.

    This new year is also of great importance in terms of rural collectivization. Before the start of spring plowing this year, it is estimated that there will be about 600,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives nationwide. If we run these 600,000 or so cooperatives well, we will not only be able to drive all farmers to better complete the agricultural production plan, but also be able to basically realize the semi-socialist collectivization of our country's agriculture on this basis in 1957. If these 600,000 or so cooperatives are not run well, the development plans for the next two years will encounter difficulties. Therefore, running 600,000 cooperatives well in 1955 has become the key to completing the agricultural collectivization plan during the first Five-Year Plan period.

    All of this shows that this year's economic work tasks are very heavy. We must ensure that all tasks are completed accurately in accordance with the planned targets, and in particular, we should strive to overfulfill them in terms of industrial and agricultural production.

    In order to complete the construction tasks for 1955, we must strengthen planning; we must practice strict economy and overcome waste; and we must strive to improve technical levels and enhance technical strength.

    The planning of economic construction work must be strengthened. A relatively prominent problem in industrial production last year was the imbalance between supply, production, and sales. On the one hand, many industrial products could not keep up with demand, and on the other hand, there was a backlog of certain products. While there are many reasons for this abnormal phenomenon, a lack of planning, a high degree of blindness, and a lack of good coordination among all parties are important reasons. We must see that blindness and planning are incompatible. We are building a socialist society, not a capitalist society, so we must overcome blindness and strengthen planning. That is to say, in accordance with the general task of the country's transition period—developing the socialist and semi-socialist economy, and utilizing, restricting, and transforming the capitalist economy—we must make reasonable arrangements for the supply, production, and sales plans of state-owned enterprises, cooperative enterprises, joint state-private enterprises, and capitalist enterprises, taking all aspects into consideration to ensure that each gets what it needs, opposing blindness and strengthening socialist planning under the premise of ensuring the continuous growth of the socialist economy.

    We must practice strict economy and overcome waste. All economic departments should pay close attention to implementing the economic accounting system and strive to save national construction funds. Especially in construction, some units simply pursue external beauty and waste a lot of investment completely unnecessarily, but neglect the quality of construction. This phenomenon must be stopped. All enterprises should pay close attention to the conservation of raw materials. The phenomenon of waste of manpower must also be overcome. This requires strengthening and improving labor organization in enterprises, and resolutely correcting the phenomenon of oversized enterprise structures, overly complicated division of labor, and excessive numbers of non-production personnel in many enterprises. All units must implement strict staffing quotas, implement responsibility systems, improve labor efficiency, reduce product costs, and save expenses. It should be known that every 1 percent increase in labor productivity in state-owned industries at the central and local levels means an increase of 1.6 trillion yuan in national income; every 3 percent reduction in production costs means an increase of more than 2 trillion yuan in national income; this is such an important thing!

    We must also strive to improve the technical level of production and enhance technical strength. The fluctuating quality of products and frequent accidents in enterprises are inseparable from the backward technical level. Therefore, all economic departments must strive to strengthen technical guidance, better organize technical forces, correctly carry out technical innovation movements, formulate technical measures plans, cultivate technical forces, and conduct research, trial manufacture, and production of new products to meet the growing needs of the country and the people.

    With the progress of national construction, agricultural production and the socialist transformation of agriculture are bound to have greater development in the new year. In this area of work, the most important link is to correctly adhere to and fully implement the Party's class policy in rural areas—relying on the poor peasants (including all the new middle peasants who were originally poor peasants), firmly uniting with the middle peasants, and restricting and gradually eliminating the rich peasant economy.

    The poor peasants are the backbone of our Party and the working class in rural areas, and they are the most resolutely supportive of the policies of the Party and the People's Government. Among the poor peasants, about one-third of the households, because of the fragility of the small-peasant economy itself and the exploitation of urban and rural capitalism, urgently demanded to further solve the difficulties in production and life through mutual aid and cooperation and unified purchase and sale after the land reform. About two-thirds of the households that were originally poor peasants have risen to become new middle peasants. The new middle peasants have risen under the leadership of the Party and with the help of the People's Government, on the basis of land reform, through the road of mutual aid and cooperation; therefore, they are able to actively take the socialist road under the leadership of the Party. In all of the Party's work in rural areas in the past, this part of the peasants has been the backbone and activists, and will continue to be so in the future. Only by relying on the poor peasants (including all the new middle peasants who were originally poor peasants), who account for 50 to 70 percent of the total number of peasant households in general rural areas, can we gradually complete the cause of socialist transformation of agriculture and do a good job in unified purchase and sale and other tasks.

    The middle peasants (i.e., old middle peasants) account for more than 20 percent of the total number of peasant households in general rural areas. They are all laborers, the basic masses of the revolution, and have always been reliable allies of the working class. In the past revolutionary war, land reform, and mutual aid and cooperation movements, the middle peasants have made contributions, and they can still play an active role in the process of socialist construction and socialist transformation in the future. In order to firmly unite with the middle peasants, we must adhere to the principles of persuasion, education, and voluntariness in all rural work, and oppose any form of coercion or commandism; we must adhere to the principle of using agricultural producers' cooperatives of a semi-socialist nature as the main form of agricultural collectivization movement during the first Five-Year Plan period; in the distribution ratio of land and labor, in the method of unified use and gradual public ownership of draft animals and large farm tools, and under the principles of not disadvantaging the poor peasants and benefiting production, we must pay close attention to the principle of taking care of the interests of the middle peasants. Any tendency to deviate from the middle peasant masses is dangerous and wrong.

    The rich peasants, as a class, are the last exploiting class in rural areas. Our country's rich peasants have been weakened and restricted in the land reform, mutual aid and cooperation movement, and unified purchase and sale. From an economic point of view, generally speaking, the rich peasants are not rising but declining. Therefore, in our country, we can gradually eliminate the rich peasant economy by restricting the development of the rich peasant economy. However, this does not mean that we can relax our vigilance against the rich peasants and abandon the struggle. Countless facts have proven that the rich peasants will not easily give up exploitation. As long as this class still exists, they will do everything possible to sabotage the cause of socialist transformation, corrupt rural cadres, and sow discord among the peasants. A small number of rural cadres have relaxed their vigilance, lost their stand, and have been induced by rich peasants to become corrupt and degenerate, helping rich peasants to do evil. Therefore, we must recognize the seriousness of the rich peasants' sabotage, increase our vigilance a hundredfold, and learn from the lessons. Rich peasant elements who have engaged in sabotage must be punished according to law. In general, rich peasants should not be allowed to join rural mutual aid and cooperative organizations before 1957. Restricting and eliminating rich peasant exploitation is an inevitable trend of social development and is irresistible, but as long as the rich peasants abide by the government's laws and orders honestly and actively participate in labor, completely abandon rich peasant exploitation, and transform themselves into working peasants, at a certain time and under certain conditions, they will change their composition, and they still have a way out.

    As long as we correctly adhere to and fully implement the Party's class line in rural areas, the Party's socialist measures in rural areas can be carried out smoothly, the worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the working class can be further consolidated, and our country's people's democratic united front can be further consolidated.

    Not long ago, the First Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was held, and the "Charter of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference" was adopted. In the new year, our country's people's democratic united front will surely be further consolidated, and it will surely play a greater role in mobilizing and uniting the people of the whole country to complete the general task of the country's transition period and in the struggle against enemies at home and abroad.

    In order to safeguard the smooth progress of socialist construction, our people are strengthening the construction of a modern national defense; we are gradually changing the voluntary military service system to a conscription system. After the People's Government issued an order on conscripting supplementary soldiers, the young people in vast areas enthusiastically responded to the call and requested to enlist, demonstrating a high degree of patriotism and socialist consciousness. The conscripted citizens will all understand that we must not only strive to strengthen our national defense forces, but also give ourselves the opportunity to improve our military knowledge, political awareness, and cultural level, and make our physique and thoughts healthier. The conscription system cannot be fully implemented at present. Active revolutionary soldiers should not relax their combat readiness in the slightest and continue to vigilantly defend our country's socialist construction, defend the peaceful life of the people of the whole country, and defend peace in the Far East and the world.

    Now U.S. imperialism is trying to undermine our people's peaceful life and construction cause. Its policy of being hostile to the Chinese people has been repeatedly hit, and therefore it has become even more embarrassed and angry. Recently, it has brazenly signed a so-called "common defense treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group, intensifying its armed interference and war threats against the Chinese people. However, as long as they are not blind, everyone can see that the People's Republic of China cannot be bullied, and the Chinese people cannot be intimidated by any war threats. The Chinese people, with their tremendous patriotic enthusiasm, will never allow U.S. imperialism to occupy our sacred territory of Taiwan. Liberating Taiwan is the great task of the Chinese people to complete the reunification of the motherland and defend world peace. We must complete this task, eliminate Chiang Kai-shek, and crush the U.S.-Chiang war treaty. This is a serious struggle. But since our cause is just, we will surely win.

    The Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan and oppose U.S. aggression is inseparable from the struggle of the people of the world to defend peace, democracy, and independence and freedom. It has not been ten years since the end of World War II, and the world has once again been subjected to serious war threats created by the U.S. aggression group. On this day in 1955, people should remember that in 1945, the world won the victory of the anti-fascist war from enormous bloodshed. At that time, many international agreements aimed at maintaining lasting world peace and solving post-war problems were reached, and the United Nations organization was established; however, in a short period of time, the U.S. aggression group and its followers abandoned all international agreements, ruined the UN Charter, stepped up the revival of German and Japanese militarist forces, organized military aggression systems surrounding the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries in the East and the West, and attempted to plunge all mankind into another greater disaster. The people of all countries in the world who still have vivid memories of the trauma of World War II cannot tolerate this crime of the U.S. aggression group.

    The people of all countries have been persistently fighting against war and defending peace, and the international peace front is constantly expanding and becoming increasingly consolidated. The victory of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, the Korean armistice, and the restoration of peace in Indochina are the results of this hard work. At present, the people of Europe are fighting to defeat the plan to rearm West Germany and establish a West European military bloc, and the eight-nation declaration issued by the European Conference is the guiding program for this major struggle.

    However, the struggle between the forces of peace and the forces of war is arduous and will be carried out repeatedly over a long period of time. This year will be a year of continued sharp struggle between the forces of peace and the forces of war. In order to win this struggle, we must further consolidate and strengthen the unity and strength of the socialist camp, and more widely unite all peace-loving people around the world to work together to defend peace and eliminate the threat of war.

    Our country's unbreakable unity with the great Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries is a powerful force for defending world peace. The talks between the governments of China and the Soviet Union in November of last year have made the friendship between our two countries even more unparalleled. The unity of China and the Soviet Union in the struggle to defend peace has had and continues to have an increasingly significant impact on the international situation. The Soviet Union's selfless assistance to our country in all aspects has accelerated the speed of our country's socialist construction. Our people need a peaceful international environment in order to build their own country. We are willing to expand normal relations with Asian countries and other countries in the world on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and further promote friendship between the people of all countries. The increase in friendship between China and India, Burma, Indonesia, and other Asian countries is undoubtedly a very important contribution to the cause of peace in Asia and the world. The international situation is continuing to develop in a direction that is favorable to peace and unfavorable to the enemies of peace.

    On this day of 1955, history is calling us, bringing us new tasks and new hopes. Let us work harder and more vigorously!

    迎接一九五五年的任务
    今天是一九五五年的元旦。一九五五年对我国人民来说，是极其重要的一年。这一年将是全世界和平力量为克服新战争的威胁、保卫和平而斗争的一年，将是全中国人民继续为解放台湾、消灭蒋贼、粉碎美蒋战争条约而斗争的一年，也将是我国第一个五年计划建设具有决定意义的一年。
    我国人民满怀勇气和信心踏上自己祖国的第一个五年计划建设的第三年。我国人民在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，既已成为国家的主人、社会的主人、历史的主人，我们就完全能够按照社会发展的法则，通过自己的创造性劳动，实行有计划的建设，把我国逐步建成为一个繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。
    过去的一年，我们的国家计划执行的情况是成功的。一九五四年的工业生产和基本建设有了显著的发展。在这一年新建、改建和续建的有三百个重大工业建设项目。人们看到了鞍钢薄板厂、太原电热厂、量具刃具厂、风动工具厂等许多规模巨大的新建工厂；也看到了抚顺石油二厂、丰满水电站、玉门油矿等许多改建和扩建的工厂，它们正在开始为国家和人民的需要而生产。七百多公里的新建铁路线按计划完成了，康藏、青藏两公路最近已正式通车。虽然去年我国遭遇到近百年未有的洪水，但是全国的粮食总产量仍然比前年增加了百分之三左右。农村合作事业有更大的发展，全国农业生产合作社已由去年秋收以前的二十二万五千个增加到四十多万个。国营商业和合作社商业及手工业、公私合营和私人资本主义的经济，也都有了发展。在生产不断发展的基础上，全国劳动人民的物质和文化生活的水平相应地得到了提高。这些成就，以及我们在建设中取得的经验，就使我们在迎接今年更加巨大的工作任务时具有充分的胜利信心。
    为什么一九五五年是我国第一个五年计划建设具有决定意义的一年呢？首先因为今年基本建设的工作量将远比过去任何一年为多，国家对基本建设的投资，约比去年增加百分之四十以上；我国第一个五年计划的骨干——苏联政府帮助我国建设的一百四十一项重点工程，已经开工的今年将进入最紧张的施工阶段，未开工的今年大部要完成准备工作。同时，五年计划的最后两年还将完成基本建设的百分之五十左右的工作量，如果今年赶不上进度，把工程推迟下去，就会严重影响后两年基本建设计划的完成。
    今年的经济工作的任务所以特别繁重，还因为与工业发展密切不可分的农业生产接连遭受了严重的自然灾害，虽然经过人民政府和全体农民的努力，农业生产仍是上升的，但是都还没有达到原定的增产指标，因而轻工业的发展和人民消费品的供应也受到了限制。为了克服这种状况，今年各地党委必须尽最大努力，领导农民争取较多的增产，以弥补前两年自然灾害所造成的损失。
    这个新的年度在农村合作化方面也是关系重大的。今年春耕开始之前，估计全国农业生产合作社将达到六十万个左右。把这六十万个左右的社办好了，就不但能够带动全体农民更好地完成农业生产计划，而且能够在这个基础上，使我国农业在一九五七年基本上实现半社会主义的合作化。这六十万个左右的社如果办不好，以后两年的发展计划就会遇到困难。因此，在一九五五年办好六十万个社，就成为第一个五年计划期间完成农业合作化计划的关键。
    这些都说明，今年经济工作的任务是非常重大的，我们必须使各项工作都能按照计划的指标，准确地完成，而特别是在工业生产和农业生产方面，应力求争取超额完成。
    为了完成一九五五年的建设任务，我们必须加强计划性；必须厉行节约，克服浪费；必须努力提高技术水平，增强技术力量。
    经济建设工作的计划性是必须加强的。去年工业生产中一个比较突出的问题是供产销之间的不平衡。许多工业产品一方面赶不上需要，另一方面又有某些产品积压。这种不正常的现象的产生固然有许多原因，而计划性不强、盲目性很大、各方面配合不够好却是重要的原因。我们必须看到盲目性和计划性是不能相容的。我们要建设的是社会主义社会，不是资本主义社会，因此就必须克服盲目性，加强计划性。这就是说，要根据国家过渡时期的总任务，发展社会主义和半社会主义的经济，利用、限制和改造资本主义的经济，在保证社会主义经济不断增长的前提之下，对于国营企业、合作社企业、公私合营企业和资本主义企业的供产销计划，必须加以合理的安排，统筹兼顾，使它们各得其所，反对盲目性，加强社会主义的计划性。
    我们必须厉行节约，克服浪费。各个经济部门应该十分注意贯彻经济核算制度，竭力节省国家建设的资金。特别是在建筑方面，有些单位简单地追求外表美观，完全不应当地浪费了很多投资，但是忽视了建筑的质量。这种现象必须制止。各个企业对于原材料的节约应切实注意。人力浪费的现象也必须加以克服。这就要加强和改善企业中的劳动组织，坚决纠正许多企业机构庞大、分工过于烦琐、非生产人员过多的现象。一切单位都要实行严格的定员定额，贯彻责任制度，提高劳动效率，降低产品的成本和节约开支。应该知道，中央和地方的国营工业的劳动生产率每提高百分之一，就意味着国家增加了一万六千亿元的收入；生产成本每降低百分之三，就意味着国家增加了二万多亿元的收入；这是多么重要的事情啊！
    我们还必须努力提高生产的技术水平，增强技术力量。现在企业中产品质量忽高忽低，大小事故时常发生，都是和技术水平落后不可分的。因此，各个经济部门必须努力加强技术指导，更好地组织技术力量，正确开展技术革新运动，制定技术措施计划和培养技术力量，进行新产品的研究、试制和生产，以满足国家和人民日益增长的需要。
    随着国家建设的进展，在新的年度里，农业生产和农业的社会主义改造必然要有更大的发展。在这一方面的工作中，最重要的环节是正确坚持和全面贯彻党在农村的阶级政策——依靠贫农（包括全部原来是贫农的新中农），巩固地团结中农，限制和逐步消灭富农经济。
    贫农是我们党和工人阶级在农村中的支柱，他们是最坚决拥护党和人民政府的政策的。贫农之中大约有三分之一的农户因为受了小农经济本身的脆弱性和城乡资本主义的剥削，在土地改革以后迫切要求通过互助合作和统购统销，进一步解决生产上和生活上的困难。原来的贫农中大约有三分之二的农户已经上升为新中农了。新中农是在党的领导和人民政府的帮助下，在土地改革的基础上，通过互助合作的道路上升起来的；因此，他们是能够在党的领导下，积极地走社会主义道路的。过去党在农村的一切工作中，这一部分农民都是骨干和积极分子，今后也仍然会是这样。我们只有依靠占一般农村总农户百分之五十到七十的贫农（包括全部原来是贫农的新中农），才能逐步完成农业社会主义改造的事业，才能做好统购统销等其他工作。
    中农（即老中农）在一般农村中约占百分之二十以上，他们都是劳动者，是革命的基本群众，历来都是工人阶级的可靠的同盟军。在过去的革命战争、土地改革和互助合作运动中，中农都是有贡献的，今后仍然能够在社会主义建设和社会主义改造过程中起积极的作用。为了巩固地团结中农，必须在一切农村工作中坚持说服教育和自愿的原则，反对任何形式的强迫命令作风；必须坚持在第一个五年计划时期以半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社作为农业合作化运动的主要形式；在土地和劳力的分红比例上，在耕畜、大农具统一使用和逐步公有化的办法上，在不使贫农吃亏和有利于生产的原则下，要切实注意照顾中农利益的原则，任何脱离中农群众的倾向，都是危险的和错误的。
    富农作为一个阶级来说，是农村中最后的一个剥削阶级。我国的富农在土地改革、互助合作运动和统购统销中已经受到了削弱和限制，从经济方面来看，一般地说富农不是上升而是下降的。所以，在我国可以用限制富农经济发展的办法，逐步消灭富农经济。但是，这决不是说，我们可以对富农放松警惕、放弃斗争。无数事实证明富农是不会轻易放弃剥削的。只要这个阶级还存在，他们就会极力用来破坏社会主义的改造事业，腐蚀农村干部，挑拨农民的团结。有少数农村干部放松了警惕、丧失了立场，已经受富农引诱而腐化堕落、帮助富农为非作歹。因此，我们必须认识富农破坏的严重性，百倍地提高警惕，吸取教训。对于有破坏行为的富农分子，必须依法给以惩罚。在一九五七年以前，一般地不应该吸收富农参加农村互助合作的组织。限制和消灭富农剥削是社会发展的必然趋势，是不可抗拒的，但是，只要富农规规矩矩老老实实地服从政府的法律和命令，积极参加劳动，彻底抛弃富农剥削，把自己改造成为劳动农民，到了一定时期，在一定的条件下，他们就将改变成分，他们仍然是有出路的。
    只要我们正确坚持和全面贯彻党在农村中的阶级路线，党在农村中的社会主义措施就能够顺利地进行，工人阶级领导下的工农联盟就能够更加巩固，我国的人民民主统一战线也就能够更加巩固。
    不久以前，中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会举行了第一次全体会议，通过了“中国人民政治协商会议章程”。在新的一年，我国的人民民主统一战线必将更加巩固，在动员和团结全国人民完成国家过渡时期总任务和反对内外敌人的斗争中一定会发挥更加巨大的作用。
    为了保卫社会主义建设的顺利进行，我国人民正在加强现代化的国防建设；我们正在把志愿兵役制度逐步改变为义务兵役制度。在人民政府颁布了关于征集补充兵员的命令以后，广大地区的青年热烈响应号召，要求应征入伍，表现出了高度的爱国主义和社会主义的觉悟。应征的公民都会懂得，我们不但要努力增强国防力量，而且要使自己有机会提高军事知识、政治觉悟和文化水平，使自己的体格和思想更加健全起来。义务兵役制度目前还不可能全部实行，现役革命军人应当丝毫也不放松战斗准备，继续时刻警惕地保卫我国的社会主义建设，保卫全国人民的和平生活，保卫远东和世界和平。
    现在美帝国主义正在力图破坏我国人民的和平生活和建设事业。它同中国人民为敌的政策一再遭到打击，因而更加恼羞成怒，最近竟悍然同蒋介石卖国集团签订所谓“共同防御条约”，加紧对中国人民进行武装干涉和战争威胁。但是，只要不是瞎子就都能看到，中华人民共和国是不可欺侮的，中国人民不是任何战争威胁所能吓倒的。具有巨大的爱国主义热情的中国人民，决不能允许美国帝国主义霸占我们的神圣领土台湾。解放台湾是中国人民完成祖国统一和保卫世界和平的伟大任务，我们一定要完成这个任务，消灭蒋贼，粉碎美蒋的战争条约。这是一场严重的斗争。但既然我们的事业是正义的，我们就一定要胜利。
    我国人民解放台湾、反对美国侵略的斗争，是同全世界人民捍卫和平、民主和独立自由的斗争不可分割的。第二次世界大战结束还不满十年，全世界又遭到美国侵略集团所制造的严重的战争威胁。在一九五五年的今天，人们应该记得，一九四五年这个世界才从巨大的流血中赢得了反法西斯战争的胜利。那时候，以维护世界持久和平为目的、解决战后问题的许多国际协议达成了，联合国组织建立起来了；但是，曾几何时，美国侵略集团和它的追随者竟然就背弃了所有的国际协议，糟塌了联合国宪章，加紧复活德、日军国主义势力，在东方和西方组织包围苏联、中华人民共和国和人民民主国家的军事侵略体系，企图把全人类投入另一个更大的灾难中去。所有对第二次世界大战的创痛记忆犹新的世界各国人民，无论如何是不能容忍美国侵略集团的这种罪行的。
    各国人民一直坚持不懈地为反对战争、保卫和平而奋斗，国际的和平阵线正在不断扩大和日益巩固。抗美援朝的胜利，朝鲜停战和印度支那和平的恢复，就是这种努力奋斗的结果。目前，欧洲人民正为打败重新武装西德和建立西欧军事集团的计划而斗争，欧洲会议发出的八国宣言正是这个重大斗争的指导纲领。
    但是，和平力量和战争势力的斗争是艰巨的，要长期反复进行的。今年将是和平力量对战争势力继续进行尖锐斗争的一年。为了这个斗争的胜利，我们必须更加巩固和增强社会主义阵营的团结和力量，并且更加广泛地团结全世界一切爱好和平的人民，来为保卫和平、消除战争威胁而共同努力。
    我国同伟大的苏联和人民民主国家之间的牢不可破的团结是保卫世界和平的强大力量。去年十一月中苏两国政府的会谈，使我们两国的友谊更加无比地增强了。中苏两国为保卫和平而斗争的团结一致，对国际局势已经发生和继续发生着日益巨大的影响。苏联对我国的各方面的无私援助，加速了我国社会主义建设的速度。我国人民为了建设自己的国家，需要有一个和平的国际环境。我们愿在和平共处的五项原则的基础上，努力扩大同亚洲和世界各国的正常关系，更加促进各国人民之间的友谊。中国和印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚以及亚洲其他国家友谊的增进，无疑地对于亚洲和世界的和平事业是一种很重要的贡献。国际形势正在继续朝着有利于和平，而不利于和平的敌人的方向发展。
    在一九五五年到来的今天，历史召唤着我们，给我们带来了新的任务和新的希望，让我们更加奋发努力吧！
