A total of 240 representatives from seven ethnic groups, including Han, Hui, Tibetan, Mongolian, Tu, Salar, and Kazakh, attended the meeting.

The meeting elected the members of the Qinghai Provincial People's Committee. Sun Zuobin (Han) was elected Governor; Xirao Jiacuo (Tibetan), Ma Fuchen (Hui), Zhang Guosheng (Han), and Zha Xi Wangxu (Tibetan) were elected Vice Governors; Zha Xi Caiwang Duojie (Tibetan), Dan De'er (Tibetan), Dan Zeng Jiancuo (Tibetan), Gu Jia Sai (Tibetan), Li Sh茂ao, Songbu (Tu), Ma Wending (Hui), Ma Letian (Hui), Xia Ricang (Tibetan), Sun Junyi, Chen Sigong, Sangre Jiacuo (Tibetan), Gao Feng, Liang Changhan, Kang Jianxi, Huang Wenyuan (Mongolian), Hua Baozang (Tibetan), Yang Xiyao, Liao Aiting, Ji Chunguang, Xue Hongfu, Wei Shuzi, and Han Meiting (Salar) (those without ethnic group annotation are Han) were elected as members of the Qinghai Provincial People's Committee. Zhou Yujie was elected President of the Qinghai Provincial Higher People's Court.

The meeting listened to Sun Zuobin's report on the First Session of the First National People's Congress; summarized Qinghai Province's work in 1954 and determined the tasks for 1955. The meeting considered that Qinghai Province had made great achievements in various tasks in 1954. In the past year, the province established one autonomous region equivalent to a special district, six autonomous regions equivalent to a county, and five autonomous regions equivalent to a district. Now, all minority areas in the province have implemented regional autonomy. A total of 135 agricultural production cooperatives have been established in the province. Most agricultural areas achieved good harvests in 1954. The province's grain output exceeded the plan by 7.3 percent. It is expected that the livestock breeding plan in pastoral areas can also be completed. The total industrial output value is expected to complete 105 percent of the plan, an increase of 95 percent compared to 1953. The state-owned commercial purchase and sales plans can be overfulfilled and can be more than doubled compared to 1953. The Qinghai-Tibet Highway and the Xining-Yushu section of the Qinghai-Kang Highway have been successfully opened to traffic. In 1955, agricultural areas should vigorously carry out an agricultural production increase movement centered on mutual assistance and cooperation. The province should run 800 agricultural production cooperatives well, requiring that peasant households participating in the cooperatives account for 9.65 percent of the total number of peasant households; the total grain output should increase by 5 percent compared to 1954; and the oil crop output should increase by 35.5 percent compared to 1954. The ethnic regional autonomous governments in pastoral areas should gradually shift the focus of leadership to various economic tasks centered on the development of animal husbandry production, and thoroughly implement the policy of protecting and increasing livestock.

The meeting passed a resolution to change the names and organizational structures of the special district-level and county-level ethnic autonomous regions in Qinghai Province. It was decided to change the name of the special district-level ethnic autonomous region to autonomous prefecture, and the name of the county-level ethnic autonomous region to autonomous county. The meeting reviewed and approved the Qinghai Province's 1955 fiscal budget.

Finally, the meeting passed a resolution on resolutely opposing the US-Chiang treaty and supporting the liberation of Taiwan.
