Agricultural Production Cooperatives Cannot Be Run This Way
Li Tingxuan

In 1954, Guangling County, Shanxi Province, established eighty-nine agricultural production cooperatives, with 2,376 participating households, accounting for 9.5 percent of the county's total households. Most of these eighty-nine cooperatives were not run well.

The production management of some cooperatives was a complete mess. Harvested wheat was left unattended in the fields, and harvested flax was left in the yards to be rained on. There were still many beans left in the threshed bean stalks. The Liuzui Village cooperative used over a hundred workdays to build a pigsty, and dug up 3,500 catties of sweet potatoes before they were fully grown to feed the pigs.

Some cooperatives, although increasing production, suffered from poor management, spreading themselves too thin, and investing too much, resulting in reduced actual income for the members. The Wangjiabu cooperative members didn't use their own livestock and farm tools but took out loans to buy new ones. A cooperative with forty-nine households borrowed over 20 million yuan to buy two carts, ten cattle, and one horse, and also bought seven seeders and eleven pockets, and bought a millstone that was never used, being "placed under house arrest." Administrative expenses amounted to 3.76 million yuan. The cooperative currently has over 20 million yuan in outstanding debt. The total income of the cooperative in 1954 was 85.8 million yuan, and expenditures (not including loans for livestock and carts) amounted to 22.34 million yuan, about 26 percent of the total income. If we add the depreciation costs of the two carts, ten cattle, and one horse, which is 4 million yuan, plus the 4.85 million yuan earned from sideline businesses invested in agriculture, and the 2.1 million yuan valuation of sixty cartloads of manure from 1953, the total expenditures would be 33.29 million yuan, about 38.7 percent of the total income. Last year, the average yield per mu in this cooperative was 82 jin, while the average yield per mu of the Guo Lianzhong mutual aid team in the same village was 78.6 jin. After deducting costs, the agricultural cooperative yielded only 51 jin per mu, while the Guo Lianzhong mutual aid team yielded 54 jin per mu. This situation is not isolated in Guangling County.

The distribution work in many cooperatives was also poorly done. The Guangling County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party did not effectively lead the cooperatives in conducting political work during distribution, but rigidly stipulated that "the grain harvested by the agricultural cooperative will not be distributed temporarily, but will be kept in centralized custody by the cooperative, and will be distributed after the public grain is handed over and the surplus grain is sold." The members did not understand the benefits and specific methods of doing so, and were worried that they would not get their share after the public grain was handed over and the surplus grain was sold, so their minds became unstable. In the distribution, the principle of "distribution according to labor as the main factor, taking into account land" was not truly implemented. Some cooperatives even distributed the grain equally "according to the number of heads." The Langhuping cooperative distributed sweet potatoes at an average of 150 jin per person. The Guojiaquan Nancun cooperative divided the grain equally among the people. In many cooperatives, the land remuneration was higher than the labor remuneration. In 1954, the total agricultural income of the Wangjiabu Agricultural Cooperative was 85.8 million yuan. After deducting investment, the net income was 52.61 million yuan, of which land rent accounted for 43 percent of the net income, and one labor day only earned 2,800 yuan (the labor remuneration was raised only after two adjustments).

Many cooperatives, before production had significantly increased and without conducting proper ideological education work or mobilizing the masses of members for democratic discussion, blindly allowed a few cadres to make decisions and fully value livestock and large farm tools as collective property. This also caused very serious consequences. Some farmers said, "It's okay to value livestock as collective property, but it's not certain when we'll get the money back, so it's better to sell it for cash and spend it freely." When Baijiafen Village established a cooperative in 1954, it fully valued the farmers' three cattle, four donkeys, and one horse as collective property. By July, when livestock prices were falling, the county committee ordered a correction and returned the livestock to the private ownership of the members. Some middle peasant members said with dissatisfaction, "The livestock prices have fallen, and now they're giving them back to us; the agricultural cooperative is always right." After the livestock were returned, members Bai Haiyu and Bai Nan sold one horse and one cow. Seeing this situation, one wealthy middle peasant household, three old middle peasant households, and one new middle peasant household outside the cooperative sold two horses, two donkeys, and one cow. Some people were afraid of suffering losses if they joined the cooperative in the future, so they sold livestock in large quantities after the autumn harvest. The cooperative director, Li Laoxiong, took the lead in selling his cow, earning 1.1 million yuan, which he spent lavishly on eating and drinking. The deputy director, Li Zhu, saw the director sell his cow and also sold his own cow. Subsequently, seven new middle peasant households (including four party members), seven old middle peasant households, and one rich peasant household outside the cooperative sold seven donkeys, two horses, and two mules. Some people also exchanged large animals for small ones, and good ones for bad ones; two horses were exchanged for a mule foal and a donkey foal, and two large donkeys were exchanged for two small donkeys. Out of the 320 households in the village, 17 households sold livestock, of which 13 were afraid of suffering losses by joining the cooperative, three had genuine difficulties, and one was a rich peasant. Some people also bought livestock, but in small numbers. Only two poor peasant households jointly bought a donkey foal, and one poor peasant household bought a donkey alone.

Many agricultural cooperatives also had another bias on the issue of livestock, which was to pay excessively high prices for hiring privately owned livestock from members. Last year, the total expenditure of the Zhaozhuang Village cooperative was 21.38 million yuan, accounting for 31 percent of the total income. Of this, the wages for hiring livestock accounted for 6.5 million yuan, or 30.4 percent of the expenditure (not including the two public livestock in the cooperative). The cooperative had a total of 997.7 mu of land. If the method of renting livestock was adopted, seven livestock would be enough. The annual rent and feed costs for seven livestock would be about 3.85 million yuan. That is to say, compared to renting livestock, the cooperative would lose twice as much by hiring livestock (the main losers in the distribution were the poor peasants). Moreover, the method of hiring livestock would also affect the collective farming of the agricultural cooperative. The members would have to feed their own livestock and do the work of the cooperative, which would be chaotic and delay production.

The failure of Guangling County to run the agricultural production cooperatives well last year had a very bad impact on the members and peasants outside the cooperative. Some members withdrew from the cooperative because their income decreased after joining, and they said dissatisfiedly to the peasants outside the cooperative, "I joined the cooperative this year and lost money. Don't follow our example!" In the autumn of last year, more than seventy peasant households in Wangwabao Village had originally signed up to join the cooperative, but now only thirty households remained, and they were still undecided. The Liuzui Village cooperative had a large scale but a weak foundation, and some members also wanted to withdraw. The peasants in this village resolutely refused to join the old cooperative. The thirty peasant households who newly requested to join the cooperative established a new cooperative. Peasants in villages where the old cooperatives were not run well all discussed the old cooperatives in this way: "Agricultural cooperatives are good, but the cooperative in our village is not run well."

Why were these old cooperatives not run well?

It still comes down to leadership. The Guangling County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party did not earnestly implement the policy of "the whole party running the cooperatives." Of the seven county committee members, only three comrades were relatively familiar with the policies and operations of running cooperatives, while the other four were only partially familiar. A recent test of 204 county and district cadres showed that only 85 scored 60 or above, accounting for about 41.6 percent of the total number. Among the 129 people who regularly went to the countryside to do rural work, only 66 scored 60 or above. Zhang Shanxing, the leader of the work team who often went to the countryside to engage in mutual aid and cooperation work, only scored 25 points. Some answered that the current basic task in the countryside was "handing over public grain," and some believed that "rigidly dividing and rigidly memorizing" was "small contracting," and "rigidly dividing and flexibly appraising" was "large contracting."

Why was the policy and business level of the county and district cadres so low? The main reason was that the county committee did not "drill in and become an expert." After the cadres went to the countryside, the county committee rarely guided their learning, and they slowly became "out of touch"事務主義者 (a person who focuses on bureaucratic procedure and detail rather than the overall goal), or even became prisoners of capitalism. According to the general feedback from the lower-level cadres, they could only return to the county four times a year except in special circumstances: once for the spring plowing production mobilization meeting, once for the summer production mobilization meeting, once for the autumn production mobilization meeting, and once for the winter purchase, mutual aid cooperation, and production mobilization meeting. This may be a bit exaggerated. However, it can be said with certainty that the county committee rarely systematically organized county and district cadres to study policies and business.

The county committee only listened to reports from below and rarely went down to inspect the work on the ground.

Wangwabao Agricultural Production Cooperative in this county started running the cooperative in 1953, and absorbed Song Shanzhen, a Kuomintang member and secretary of the puppet township, and Cao Xing, the son of a Yiguandao altar master, into the cooperative, but the county committee always believed that "there was no problem." It was not until the spring of 1954 that it was discovered that Song Shanzhen was using his accounting position to make trouble, and his accounting position was replaced, but he was still left in the cooperative to produce, and Liu Tingjie, the leader of the Wangwabao work team, even praised him. The position of accountant was given to Cao Xing (his father did not join the cooperative, rented twenty mu of land from two widows outside the cooperative, and also sold snacks). After Cao Xing became the accountant, he colluded with Song Shanzhen, and won over cooperative cadres and middle peasants, and kept deducting the shares of poor peasant members. When the cooperative harvested sweet potatoes, the cooperative cadres and middle peasants were given more, and the poor peasant members were given less. The poor peasant members were given more chaff when distributing grain. White flour and sesame oil were distributed according to investment. Wang Juwu, a poor peasant, borrowed grain from the cooperative several times for his wife who had nothing to eat, but he was not lent any. One night in November last year, he asked Liu Tingjie for food, but not only was the problem not solved, but he was scolded by Liu Tingjie. Even when the poor members held a meeting to oppose these unreasonable things and launched a sharp struggle against the bad elements, Liu Tingjie still did not support the just struggle of the poor peasants, but shouted and cursed loudly and suppressed the poor peasants. The cooperative was so bad, but Liu Tingjie, the leader of the Wangwabao work team, gave the county committee a false report, saying that the Wangwabao cooperative was "very good and there were no problems." The county committee only relied on the false report and considered it a "first-class cooperative," and praised Liu Tingjie for "working actively" at the expanded cadre meeting in July.

Another Shahe Agricultural Production Cooperative had a total of eleven households, and the director and accountant were both from business backgrounds. The cooperative had a total of 166.3 mu of land, of which the director had more than 30 mu and the accountant had 18 mu. They had the most land and the best land in the cooperative; therefore, the proportion of land dividends was set particularly high. Liu, the chief of the Statistics Section of the county government, helped this cooperative with the distribution work. As a result of the distribution, land dividends accounted for 76 percent of the net income, and labor dividends accounted for only 24 percent. This year, a total of 21,000 jin of sweet potatoes were harvested, and the cooperative sold 10,000 jin (to repay debts), and the poor peasant members could not get any sweet potatoes. The cooperative borrowed money to buy two horses, one mule, one cart, and one yard of houses, intending to engage in transportation and sales and open a flour mill, but did not earn much money. They hired people to drive carts and plow the land, and now they still owe more than 10 million yuan in debt. After the autumn harvest, the poor peasant members saw this situation and refused to work actively. As a result, five party members were labeled as "lazy good-for-nothings." Ren Xiufang (a party member), the production team leader, only had 3.8 mu of land and received very little grain. Whenever she talked about the agricultural cooperative, she wanted to cry. Ren Xicai, a poor peasant, only received nine dou of millet, nine dou of sorghum, and eight jin of sesame. Now he has nothing to eat and wants to ask the cooperative for land and prepare to pawn it. Ren Dianlin, a party member, has nothing to eat and is preparing to go to Kouwai. This cooperative is near Guangling City, but the county committee only listened to the feedback from the director and Chief Liu, and never went to check and solve these problems. At the expanded cadre meeting, they shouted loudly: "The five lazy good-for-nothings of the Shahe Agricultural Cooperative do not love labor, ask the director for wine and meat, and want to be kicked out of the cooperative!"

The county had eighty-nine agricultural cooperatives last year, with twenty-four resident cadres. Obviously, the leadership methods of "dividing the troops to guard the mouths" or "flying all over the sky" will not work. In the spring, the county committee also determined that Enzhuang cooperative in the mountains, and Caochuan and Jianxi cooperatives in the plains, should be the key points, directly led by the county committee, to carry out typical demonstrations. After the mutual aid and cooperation meeting was held in the prefecture in July, the experience of other places was also absorbed, and a mutual aid and cooperation network began to be established. However, "beginning" was only "beginning," and it did not persist. In fact, the leadership methods of "dividing the troops to guard the mouths" or "flying all over the sky" were still adopted. The county committee had no bottom in its heart, and the work was passive, "blocking the wind when the wind came, and blocking the rain when the rain came." When it encountered the problem of chaotic financial management, it temporarily summarized how the Dongyataou cooperative reversed the phenomenon of chaotic financial management. When it encountered the problem of chaotic labor management, it hastily introduced how the Jianxi cooperative overcame the phenomenon of chaotic labor management. Over the past year, the county committee has not comprehensively and completely summarized the work of an agricultural cooperative. The peasant masses felt that the old cooperatives were "mediocre" and could not see what was good about them. There was no good example for the resident cadres and internal backbones of the cooperatives to learn from regularly.

How can the cooperatives be run well in this way?

    不能这样办农业生产合作社
    李廷选
    山西省广灵县一九五四年办了八十九个农业生产合作社，参加农户两千三百七十六户，占全县总农户的百分之九点五。这八十九个社大部分办得不好。
    有些社的生产管理搞得一团糟，割了的小麦放在地里没人管，收了的胡麻放在场里让雨淋，已经打完的豆秸里还有许多豆子。六咀村社修了一个猪圈就用了一百来个工，地里的山芋还没长大就刨出来三千五百斤喂猪。
    有的社虽然增产了，但是因为管理不善，摊子铺得太大，投资太多，社员的实际收入却减少了。王家堡社社员自己有牲口、农具不用，却贷款去买；四十九户的一个社，就贷款买了两辆大车、十条牛、一匹马，花了两千多万元，另外还买了七张耧、十一条口袋，买了一盘粉磨没用，“关了禁闭”。行政管理费开支了三百七十六万元。现在社内还有外债两千多万元。全社一九五四年总收入八千五百八十万元；支出（不算贷款买牲口、大车）就有两千二百三十四万元，约占总收入的百分之二十六。如果加上两辆大车、十条牛、一匹马的折旧费四百万元，再加上副业挣的钱投到农业上的四百八十五万元，和一九五三年的六十车粪作价二百一十万元，共计支出三千三百二十九万元，约占总收入的百分之三十八点七。这个社去年每亩平均产量是八十二斤，同村的郭连忠互助组每亩平均是七十八斤六两。如果除去成本，农业社每亩只合五十一斤，郭连忠互助组合五十四斤。这种情况，在广灵县并不是个别的。
    许多社的分配工作做得也不好。中共广灵县委没有很好地领导各社在分配中做好政治工作，却硬性规定：“农业社打的粮食暂时不分配，由社集中保管，等缴完公粮、卖了余粮以后再分配。”社员们不了解这样做的好处和具体做法，担心缴完公粮、卖了余粮以后自己分不上，思想就动荡起来了。在分配当中，也没有真正贯彻“以劳分红为主，兼顾土地”的原则。有的社竟“按人数腿”平均分配了。狼虎坪社的山芋按每人一百五十斤平均分配。郭家圈南村社把粮食按人平均分了。许多社的土地报酬比劳动力报酬高。王家堡农业社一九五四年农业总收入是八千五百八十万元，减去投资，纯收入是五千二百六十一万元，地租占去纯收入的百分之四十三，一个劳动日才分两千八百元（后来又经过两次调整，才把劳动报酬提高了）。
    许多社在生产还没有显著提高的时候，又没有很好地进行思想教育工作，没有发动社员群众民主讨论，就由少数干部做主，盲目地把牲口、大农具完全作价归社；这也造成了很严重的恶果。有的农民说：“牲口作价归社也可以，但归了社还不一定啥时候才能还钱，不如卖了拿现成，花钱自在。”白家坟村一九五四年办社时，把农民的三头牛、四头驴、一匹马完全作价归社；到七月份牲口正在跌价的时候，县委让纠正，又把牲口归还社员私有。有些中农社员不满意地说：“牲口跌价又给我们归回来，都是农业社有理。”把牲口归回去以后，社员白海玉、白南就把一匹马、一头牛卖了。社外农民看到这种情况，有一户富裕中农、三户老中农、一户新中农就卖了两匹马、两头驴、一头牛。有些人怕以后再入社归公吃亏，秋后就大量地卖牲口。社长李老雄首先把牛卖了，得了一百一十万元，大吃二喝花了。副社长李柱看到社长卖了牛，也把自己的牛卖了。随后，社外的新中农七户（其中有党员四个）、旧中农七户、富农一户，卖了七头驴、两匹马、两头骡子。还有人用大的换小的，好的换赖的；有两匹马换了一个骡驹、一个驴驹，两个大驴换了两个小驴。全村三百二十户，有十七户卖牲口的，其中怕入社吃亏的十三户，确实有困难的三户，另一户是富农。也有人买牲口，但为数很少。全村只有两户贫农伙买了一个驴驹，一户贫农单独买了一头驴。
    许多农业社在牲口问题上还有另外一种偏向，就是雇用社员私有牲口时雇价过高。赵庄村社去年总支出是两千一百三十八万元，占总收入的百分之三十一；其中雇用牲口工资就占六百五十万元，占支出的百分之三十点四（社内还有两个公共牲口没算）。全社土地共九百九十七亩七分，如果采取租用牲口的办法，有七个牲口就够用了。七个牲口一年的租价和草料费，大约是三百八十五万元。这就是说，比起租用牲口来，社里雇用牲口要吃亏一倍（分配结果吃亏的主要是贫农）。而且，采取雇用牲口的办法，还会影响农业社的集体耕作；社员个人又要喂养牲口，又要做社里的活，也会两头忙乱，耽误生产。
    广灵县去年没有把农业生产合作社办好，在社员和社外农民中起了很不好的影响。有的社员因为入社后收入减少，就退社了，还向社外农民不满意地说：“我今年入社入败兴了，你们可再不要跟上我们败兴啦！”王窊堡村去年秋天本来有七十多户农民报名入社，现在只剩下三十多户了，还在拿不定主意。六咀村社摊子大、底子空，也有一些社员想出社。这个村的农民坚决不入老社；新要求入社的三十户农民，另办了一个新社。凡是老社没有办好的村子里的农民，都是这样议论老社的：“农业社好是好，就是我们村的社没办好。”
    为什么这些老社没有办好呢？
    还是得从领导说起。中共广灵县委对于“全党办社”这个方针并没有认真执行。七个县委委员，只有三个同志对于办社的政策、业务比较熟悉，另外四个是半通不通的。最近举行了一次测验，参加测验的县区干部共二百零四人，其中六十分以上的只有八十五人，约占总人数的百分之四十一点六。在经常下乡作农村工作的一百二十九个人当中，六十分以上的只有六十六个。经常下乡搞互助合作工作的工作组组长张善兴，只得了二十五分。有的把当前农村的基本任务答成“交公粮”，有人认为“死分死记”是“小包工”，“死分活评”是“大包工”。
    为什么县区干部的政策业务水平这样低呢？主要的原因是县委没有“钻进去，变成内行”。干部下乡以后，县委对他们的学习很少指导，他们慢慢变成“不识时务”的事务主义者，甚至当了资本主义的俘虏。据下面一般干部反映，除了特殊情况以外，他们一年当中只能回县四次：一次是春耕生产动员会，一次是夏季生产动员会，一次是秋季生产动员会，一次是冬季收购、互助合作、生产动员会。这样说也许有些过火。但是，可以肯定地说，县委是极少有计划地组织县区干部学习政策、业务的。
      县委只听下面报告，很少下去实地检查工作。
    这个县的王窊堡农业生产合作社在一九五三年开始办社，就吸收了国民党员、伪大乡秘书宋善振和一贯道坛主的儿子曹兴入社，县委却一直认为“没有什么问题”。直到一九五四年春季发现宋善振利用会计职权捣鬼，才撤换了他的会计职务，但仍留在社内生产，王窊堡工作组的组长刘廷杰还表扬了他。会计的职务交给曹兴担任。曹兴（他父亲未入社，在社外租种着两个寡妇的二十亩地，并兼卖零食）当了会计以后，就和宋善振勾结，拉拢社务干部和中农，一直克扣贫农社员。社里收下山芋，多给社务干部和中农，少给贫农社员；分粮食给贫农社员分的秕籽多；白面、胡麻油是按投资分。贫农王聚武的妻子没吃的，向社里借了好几次粮不借给。在去年十一月的一个晚上，找刘廷杰要吃的，不但问题没解决，反而被刘廷杰大骂了一顿。直到贫苦社员集会反对这些不合理的事情，向坏分子展开了尖锐的斗争，刘廷杰仍然没有支持贫农的正义斗争，反而大叫大骂，压制贫农。这个社这样糟，王窊堡工作组组长刘廷杰却给县委作假报告，说王窊堡社“很好，没有问题”。县委只是根据假报告，就认为它是“一类社”，并且在七月份的扩大干部会上表扬了刘廷杰“工作积极”。
    还有一个沙河农业生产合作社，共十一户，社长、会计都是做买卖的出身。社内共有一百六十六亩三分土地，社长有三十多亩，会计有十八亩。社内数他们两人土地多，土地好；因此，土地分红的比重规定的特别大。县政府统计科的刘科长帮助这个社做分配工作；分配结果，土地分益占纯收入的百分之七十六，劳力分红只占百分之二十四。今年共收获两万一千斤山芋，社里出卖了一万斤（为还外债），贫苦社员分不上山芋。社里贷款买了两匹马、一头骡子、一辆大车、一院房子，打算搞运销、开粉房，结果没挣了多少钱，赶车、耕地都雇人做，现在还有外债一千多万元。秋后，贫苦社员看到这种情形，就不肯积极做活了。结果，五个党员被扣上了“懒汉二流子”的帽子。生产队长任秀芳（党员）只有三亩八分地，分到很少一些粮食，一说起农业社就想哭。贫农任喜才只分到九斗黍子、九斗高粱、八斤胡麻，现在没吃的，向社里要地，准备典地。党员任佃林没吃的，准备到口外去。这个社就在广灵城附近，可是县委只听社长和这位刘科长的反映，一直没有去检查和解决这些问题，还在扩大干部会上大喊大叫：“沙河农业社的五户懒汉二流子，不爱劳动，向社长要酒要肉，要清洗出社！”
    全县去年有八十九个农业社，有二十四个驻社干部。很显然，“分兵把口”或“满天飞”的领导方法都是行不通的。县委在春季也曾确定：山上以恩庄社为重点，川下以曹川、涧西两社为重点，由县委直接领导，进行典型示范。七月份在地委召开互助合作会议以后，也吸取别的地方的经验，开始建立了互助合作网。但是，“开始”只不过是“开始”，并没有坚持下去，实际上采用的仍然是“分兵把口”或“满天飞”的领导方法。县委心中没底，工作处于被动状态，“风来了挡风，雨来了挡雨”。遇到财务管理混乱的问题时，就临时把东崖头社如何扭转财务混乱现象进行了总结；遇到劳动管理混乱的问题时，又仓促地介绍了涧西社如何克服劳动管理的混乱现象。一年来，县委没有全面地完整地总结过一个农业社的工作。农民群众感到老社“平平淡淡”，看不出老社到底有什么好。各社的驻社干部和社内骨干也没有一个可以经常学习的好榜样。
    这样，怎么能把社办好呢？
