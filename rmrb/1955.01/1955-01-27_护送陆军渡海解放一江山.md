Escorting the Army Across the Sea to Liberate Yijiangshan Island
    Lù Qímíng

On the 18th, while our air force, artillery, and naval vessels were fiercely bombarding the Chiang bandit army's positions on Yijiangshan Island, a large number of landing craft assembled in a certain harbor to transport the army for the landing, were ordered to advance towards Yijiangshan Island. The harbor was immediately filled with the deafening roar of engines and the sound of anchors being raised. Then, waves of landing craft rapidly sailed out of the bay, their bows pointing directly at Yijiangshan Island, heading towards their respective landing zones.

The landing craft squadrons were getting very close to Yijiangshan Island.

The helmsmen on each craft received the order from the commander: "All craft squadrons, form landing formation and deploy quickly!" They immediately pulled the engine control levers back forcefully, the throttles were quickly opened, and the engines roared deafeningly. All the landing craft were now speeding forward. The captains were constantly observing the landing points according to the maps, directing the helmsmen on the course. Inside the cabins, fully armed army soldiers were all lying prone in a posture ready to charge, their eyes fixed on the predetermined landing zones.

Each landing craft was only a few dozen meters away from its respective landing point. The Chiang bandit army on Yijiangshan Island fiercely opened fire on our troops from the mountains, attempting to block the advance of our craft squadrons. At this moment, all the guns and cannons on our landing craft immediately fired bullets and shells at the Chiang bandit army on the island like a rainstorm.

Naval warriors kept shouting: "Resolutely wipe out the enemy on the beachhead and cover the army's safe landing!"

On a craft, gunner Chen Shaoyao had just destroyed a Chiang bandit army bunker when he was suddenly wounded in the thigh by a bullet fired from another Chiang bandit army bunker, but he endured the pain, turned the muzzle, and immediately destroyed this bunker as well. The battle was proceeding fiercely. Some sailors were wounded themselves, but still encouraged their comrades to resolutely escort the army to land.

The first batch of landing craft squadrons bravely rushed to the landing points at the same time, and the army soldiers immediately pounced on the beachhead courageously. Engine operators and signalmen immediately carried the army's shells and supplies from the craft to the shore. Gunners continued to use fierce artillery fire to cover the army's attack on the mountains.

When the first batch of landing army soldiers were rapidly attacking the Chiang bandit army's deep positions on Yijiangshan Island, the second batch of landing craft transported the army units to the landing points. And the first batch of landing soldiers had already escorted batches of captured Chiang bandit soldiers onto the craft.

    护送陆军渡海解放一江山
    陆其明
    十八日，当我空军、炮兵和海军舰艇猛烈地向一江山岛蒋贼军阵地轰击时，集结在某港湾内运送陆军登陆的大批登陆艇，奉命向一江山岛开进。港湾中顿时响起了震耳的机器声和起锚声。接着，一队队的登陆艇迅速地驶出海湾，船头直指一江山岛，分路向各自的登陆地段进发了。
    登陆艇队离一江山岛很近了。
    各艇上的舵手接到指挥员发出的“各艇队成登陆队形，迅速展开！”的命令后立即把轮机操纵杆用力往后一拉，油门很快地加大，机器发出震耳的吼声。所有登陆艇这时都在疾驶前进。艇长们根据地图不停地观察着登陆点，向舵手指挥航行的方向。舱里全副武装的陆军战士们都以准备冲锋的姿势匍匐着，两眼紧盯着预定的登陆地段。
    各登陆艇离各自的登陆点只有几十公尺了。一江山岛上的蒋贼军从山上猛烈地向我军开火射击，妄图拦阻我军艇队前进。这时，我军各登陆艇上所有的枪、炮的子弹、炮弹立即像暴雨般地向岛上的蒋贼军打去。
    海军战士们不时地喊着：“坚决消灭滩头阵地上的敌人，掩护陆军安全登陆！”
    在艇上，射击手陈绍耀刚打毁了蒋贼军的一个碉堡，突然被从另一个蒋贼军碉堡里射出的子弹打伤了大腿，但是，他忍着痛，转过炮口，立即又把这个碉堡摧毁了。战斗激烈地进行着。有些水兵自己负伤了，还是鼓励着战友坚决护送陆军登陆。
    第一批登陆艇队在同一个时间内英勇地冲上了登陆点，陆军战士们立即勇猛地向滩头扑去。轮机员、讯号兵马上把艇上陆军部队的炮弹、物资搬运到岸上。炮手们继续用猛烈的炮火掩护着陆军向山上攻击。
    当第一批登陆的陆军战士们正在迅速向一江山岛上蒋贼军纵深阵地攻击的时候，第二批登陆艇又把陆军部队运到了登陆点。而第一批登陆的战士们已经把俘掳的蒋贼军一批批地押送到艇上来了。
