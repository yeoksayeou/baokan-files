Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 8th: TASS Moscow, January 7th: The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following statement regarding the relationship between the Soviet Union and Iraq:

    On November 6, 1954, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mr. Shabandar told the Soviet Chargé d'Affaires ad interim in Baghdad, I. N. Yakushin, that the Iraqi government had decided to close its legation in Moscow for "reasons of economy." At the same time, Mr. Shabandar said that this decision was consistent with the Iraqi government's current domestic policy of "openly combating communists domestically." He also said that if Iraq continued to have a legation in Moscow, "it would be inconsistent with this policy and could bring certain inconveniences and confusion to this policy."

    On January 3, 1955, Mr. Awni, Director of the Office of the Iraqi Foreign Ministry, handed a note to the Soviet Chargé d'Affaires ad interim. The note stated: "In view of Iraq's closure of its legation in Moscow, Iraq has decided to suspend diplomatic representation between the two countries for the time being." He also said: "The suspension of representation does not mean the severance of diplomatic relations between Iraq and the Soviet Union."

    The aforementioned actions of the Iraqi government prove that the Iraqi government has adopted an unfriendly policy towards the Soviet Union, which is bound to make international relations more tense. This action by the Nuri al-Said government is directly related to its foreign policy aimed at involving Iraq and other Arab countries in the aggressive bloc that the United States and Britain are currently putting together in the Near and Middle East. This once again proves the extent to which the current Iraqi government relies on the imperialist forces of certain countries.

    就苏联和伊拉克的关系问题
    苏联外交部发表声明
   【新华社八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科七日讯：苏联外交部就苏联和伊拉克的关系发表声明如下：
    一九五四年十一月六日，伊拉克外交大臣沙班达先生向苏联驻巴格达临时代办伊·纳·雅库欣说，伊拉克政府由于“节约的理由”，已经决定停闭它在莫斯科的公使馆。同时，沙班达先生说，这个决定是和伊拉克现政府关于“在国内公开对共产党人进行斗争”的内政政策相一致的。他又说，如果伊拉克继续在莫斯科设有公使馆，“就会不符合这种政策，并可能为这种政策带来某些不便和混乱”。
    一九五五年一月三日，伊拉克外交部办公厅主任奥尼先生把一份照会交给苏联临时代办。照会中说：“鉴于伊拉克停闭它在莫斯科的公使馆，伊拉克已决定在目前停止两国之间的外交代表权。”他还说：“停止代表权并不意味着伊拉克和苏联之间的外交关系的断绝。”
    伊拉克政府的上述行动，证明伊拉克政府对苏联采取了不友好政策，并势必使国际关系更加紧张。努里·赛义德政府的这种行动，和它的目的在于使伊拉克和其他阿拉伯国家卷入美、英两国现在正在中近东拼凑的侵略集团的外交政策直接有关。这又一次证明了伊拉克现政府对某些国家的帝国主义势力的倚赖程度。
