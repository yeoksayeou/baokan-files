Agricultural Cooperativization is the Road to Common Prosperity

	"Losing Money Ridge" Became "Fertile Ridge"
	Jijia Ridge is an infertile mountain village in Xiangyuan County, Shanxi Province. There are many mountains and little land, and the soil is very poor, resulting in low yields. In particular, farmer Yang Lisuo's eight mu of land called "Fenbeitou" (North of the Grave), could not even recoup the investment costs each year. No one wanted it, even if it was given away, so the farmers called it "Losing Money Ridge."

	In 1952, the village established the Pioneer Agricultural Production Cooperative. Over the past three years, the cooperative has used methods such as building reservoirs, using new farm tools, improving the soil, and improving farming techniques to turn more than 200 mu of thin land into fertile fields. Last year, the autumn grain yield of the Pioneer Agricultural Production Cooperative averaged 20.6 shi per mu, an increase of 87.3 percent compared to before the establishment of the cooperative. This was the biggest harvest in the history of Jijia Ridge Village. When Yang Lisuo joined the cooperative, he first offered to give his eight mu of land to the cooperative, stating that he would not share in the profits or bear agricultural taxes. At the time, the cooperative members were unwilling to accept it. Later, the cooperative director, Li Changcheng, persuaded everyone to keep it. This "Losing Money Ridge" has been deeply cultivated and meticulously managed by the agricultural production cooperative for three years, improving the soil and applying more base fertilizer. As a result, production has increased year by year. Last year, in particular, the increase in production was even more significant. The millet planted yielded 1.8 shi per mu, a three-and-a-half-fold increase compared to the best years in the past. The cooperative members were all happy and said: "Losing Money Ridge" has become "Fertile Ridge" in the hands of the agricultural production cooperative.

	Orphans Also Have Surplus Grain
	After the autumn harvest distribution of the Yang Zhixin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Donggou Township, Urumqi County, Xinjiang Province, cooperative members and surrounding farmers were talking about the story of Zhao Guozhen everywhere.

	Zhao Guozhen is a fourteen-year-old orphan with no one to rely on. When he was seven years old, his father was severely beaten by the landlord and died of illness. His mother remarried because she had no means of living. The lonely Zhao Guozhen had to herd cattle for others to make a living. Last March, the village established an agricultural production cooperative, and everyone decided to accept him into the cooperative.

	After Zhao Guozhen joined the agricultural production cooperative, because he was young and had weak labor, the cooperative only assigned him some work that he could do. For example, during spring plowing, he was asked to harrow and press the land. During summer weeding, when everyone pulled weeds and hoed, he was asked to carry the hoed grass to the edge of the field. In this way, he could get four or five work points every day. At the end of September, when he was cutting grass, he cut his hand, and the cooperative took 60,000 yuan from the public welfare fund to treat him. Usually, when he had no food or clothing, the cooperative helped him solve the problems. Therefore, under the care and help of the agricultural production cooperative, Zhao Guozhen became happier and more lively day by day. His enthusiasm for work also became greater and greater.

	Last year, the crops of the agricultural production cooperative had a bumper harvest. Zhao Guozhen was allocated more than nine shi of grain. In addition to paying public grain, paying off debts, and eating for himself, he also invested three shi of grain in the cooperative, sold more than one shi of surplus grain to the state, and made a new cotton-padded coat for himself.

	The Old Man is Truly Impressed
	In the autumn of 1953, when Cangfangping Village in Shuoxian County, Shanxi Province, was preparing to establish an agricultural production cooperative, the old man, Xie Kai, believed that: the family had six able-bodied workers, three good livestock, and sixty mu of land. A family like this with strong people and horses could only do well by working independently, so he was unwilling to join the cooperative. The eldest son, Xie Jiren, believed that even if working independently was good, it was not as powerful as an agricultural production cooperative, and he firmly wanted to join the cooperative. The old man's second son, Xie Erbai, felt that the agricultural production cooperative was newly established, and it was not certain whether it would be good or bad. He advocated joining a mutual aid team, which could overcome general difficulties and produce more grain. As a result, the father and his two sons had to go their separate ways.

	Spring plowing began, and the agricultural production cooperative was a bit chaotic due to lack of experience. When the old man Xie saw this, he asserted that the agricultural production cooperative would not be successful and announced, "We'll see who does better in the autumn!" But soon the agricultural production cooperative established various systems, and the work quickly got on track. Peas, wheat, and millet were planted in a timely manner. The production of the mutual aid team that Xie Erbai joined was also going well. Only the independent farmer, Xie Kai, could not get help, and no one helped him deliver manure or sow seeds. All kinds of crops fell behind.

	In the summer, there was heavy rainfall, and river water flooded many crops. The six mu of stubble millet field that the old man Xie originally expected to compete with the agricultural production cooperative was also flooded. The seedlings of the agricultural production cooperative that were flooded quickly turned green again after the cooperative members' rush to wash and support the seedlings and apply top dressing. The old man Xie's seedlings, because there were few people to manage them and the seedlings were small and heavily flooded, had to be replanted with small oats, but they were flooded again in a few days. Later, the agricultural production cooperative helped him buy buckwheat seeds, and he planted them again. By the time of the autumn harvest, the crops of the agricultural production cooperative ripened early and were quickly harvested. The old man Xie's six mu of buckwheat and some miscellaneous fields were frozen to death in the ground before they matured. The old man Xie invested a total of more than 8.5 shi of grain in seeds, fertilizer, etc., but only harvested five shi of grain, which was not even enough to cover the costs. The eldest son, Xie Jiren, received 22 shi of grain in the agricultural production cooperative, and Xie Erbai also harvested nine shi of grain in the mutual aid team.

	After a year of education by facts, the old man Xie sincerely admired the agricultural production cooperative. Now he and his second son, Xie Erbai, not only repeatedly ask to join the cooperative, but also promote the benefits of the agricultural production cooperative everywhere and mobilize everyone to join the cooperative.

	The Story of the Private Plot
	Last spring, when the Meijing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Liuan County, Anhui Province, was established, cooperative member Li Changyou only joined the cooperative with 1.5 shi of land, leaving the remaining four dou for himself. Everyone advised him not to keep this land, but he ignored it.

	He was a middle peasant with all kinds of farming livestock and tools. When the mutual aid team was preparing to establish a cooperative, he felt torn: if he joined the cooperative, others would have two or three laborers, while his family only had one, so he would definitely suffer; if he didn't join the cooperative, there would be many difficulties in production. He also felt that in the mutual aid team, he was always ahead of others in everything. Now that the cooperative was moving towards socialism, could he still fall behind? Therefore, he was very conflicted.

	After all kinds of matters concerning the establishment of the cooperative were handled, other cooperative members happily worked hard. Only Li Changyou was worried, wondering how to cultivate these four dou of private plot. Before spring plowing, all cooperative members, in addition to participating in public manure accumulation, also valued their own accumulated manure and turned it over to the cooperative. Only Li Changyou kept his manure for his own private plot, which aroused dissatisfaction among the others. The cooperative charter stipulates: labor discipline must be observed, and there must be no lateness or early departure. Others had no difficulties, but Li Changyou had difficulty. In addition to working for the cooperative on time, he also had to take time to work on his private plot, which made him exhausted. The next day, while others worked with vigor and vitality, he dozed off in the field and was often criticized by everyone.

	His four dou of private plot, because of rough cultivation and drought, only harvested 2.2 shi of grain in the autumn. The crops in the cooperative, because of careful cultivation and more fertilizer, all increased production by 24% compared to the previous year. His land that joined the cooperative used to yield only 20 shi of rice, but last year it yielded more than 30 shi. During the distribution of profits, he received a net of 21 shi of rice, which was equal to his total income in the past year. If the grain distributed from late autumn crops was added, it would be an actual increase of 30% compared to the past. Now, he has also joined the cooperative with his four dou of private plot.

	Losing the Competition for Three Years
	Yu Cailin is a middle peasant in Dingxiangba Village, Shuanglin Township, Hangxian County, Zhejiang Province. He has all kinds of farm tools and livestock, as well as more than ten mu of ancestral land. He and his son are also strong laborers, and he is also a good farmer. Therefore, he is very confident that he is stronger than others and does not believe in the principle of organizing to achieve common prosperity.

	In the spring of 1952, the township established the Jiang Hongyuan Agricultural Production Cooperative and set a target of increasing rice production to 450 jin per mu. At that time, Yu Cailin believed that the agricultural production cooperative was talking big and thought he would definitely compete with the agricultural production cooperative.

	But in the first year, the agricultural production cooperative won the competition. The agricultural production cooperative not only completed the production increase plan, but also produced 15 jin more per mu than planned, while Yu Cailin only harvested more than 380 jin per mu. Even so, Yu Cailin was not convinced. He thought it was a lucky coincidence and thought he would wait and see what happened next year! Who would have thought that the second year would be a major drought year. It did not rain for fifty or sixty days. The pumping station of the agricultural production cooperative used boats to move the pumps to the areas which lacked water. The cooperative not only saved its own fields from the drought, but also helped the nearby mutual aid teams and independent farmers save more than 600 mu of rice paddies. Yu Cailin could neither afford a pumping station nor hire workers to pump water. Carrying water to irrigate the land, he could only carry six or seven loads of water a day, which made his back ache and he could only see a water mark. He watched as one plot of land after another cracked open. At this time, Yu Cailin had to admit that the agricultural production cooperative was stronger than his independent farming. In the year, the cooperative had another bumper harvest, harvesting more than 100 jin of rice per mu more than Yu Cailin. This time Yu Cailin admitted defeat, but he did not apply to join the cooperative. He thought: I'll try another year. In 1954, there was another major flood. Yu Cailin was helpless in the face of the flood. He watched the flood and could not transplant rice seedlings, while the agricultural production cooperative had many people and great strength. They quickly removed the accumulated water and rushed to plant more than 130 mu of late rice. After the flood, the late rice in the cooperative grew green and better than in any other year, averaging more than 600 jin per mu. The fact that the Jiang Hongyuan Agricultural Production Cooperative had continuously overcome various natural disasters and achieved bumper harvests like a magnet was attracting the surrounding farmers to take the road of cooperativization. Therefore, the Jiang Hongyuan Agricultural Production Cooperative has expanded from the eleven households at the beginning of its establishment to 150 households. At this time, Yu Cailin was no longer willing to work independently. He also signed up to participate in the newly established Dingxiangba Village Agricultural Production Cooperative.

	Yang Fenghuai's Enthusiasm for Labor Increased
	Yang Fenghuai is a farmer in Sanhe Village, Chengde County, Hebei Province. He is thirty-two years old this year. Before the land reform, he was a poor peasant with very little land. From the age of twenty, he rented land to farm. Half of the grain he painstakingly harvested had to be handed over to the landlord, while he had to eat chaff and wild vegetables. Years of hard work led to years of hunger. This kind of life made him tired of labor. He thought: "Anyway, it's not enough to eat, so it's better to suffer less." From then on, he did not take good care of the land. He didn't get up until the sun shone on the eaves of the house in the morning. When hoeing the ground, he played with the hoe or sat under the shade of a tree to chat and sleep. He didn't even carry a load of water or pick up a piece of firewood. Whenever there was no rice to cook, he would beat and scold his wife to vent his anger.

	After liberation, Yang Fenghuai was allocated eight mu of land. But at this time, his laziness had become a habit, and he still didn't work hard because he didn't have any farm animals. His fields were always overgrown with weeds, and he ran out of food three or four months after the autumn harvest, relying on government relief. Last spring, the village established an agricultural production cooperative. After he joined the cooperative, he was still very lazy at first. The cooperative sent people to call him to work in the fields every day. Later, after continuous education and help from the cooperative, he realized that today was not the same as before, and his attitude towards labor began to change. At this time, the cooperative also announced the accounts for the past six months. After listening to it, he regretted it very much. Other cooperative members had done more than 100 workdays, while he had only done about 70 workdays. He regretted not being late and lazy, which not only affected his income but also made him feel like he owed something to the cooperative, and he felt uneasy. From then on, Yang Fenghuai was determined to get rid of his laziness. In order to be able to hear the bugle clearly and ensure that he got up and went to the field on time, he borrowed a house near the cooperative, overcoming the phenomenon of being late. Once, the cooperative's horse was sick and needed someone to take care of it at night. He took the initiative to take on the job and carefully took care of the sick horse, which was praised by the cooperative. Later, his enthusiasm for labor became even greater, and he gradually developed the habit of labor. In August, he developed sores on his back and could not work, but he still went to the field. When he had nothing to do, he would go to the cooperative to add feed to the horses or sweep the yard. Because his attitude towards labor had improved, he was praised by the cooperative three times and was also elected as the deputy leader of the production team.

    农业合作化是大家富裕的道路
    “赔钱岭”变成了“肥田岭”
    冀家岭是山西省襄垣县一个贫瘠的山村，山多地少，土质很坏，产量也很低，特别是农民杨里锁那块名叫“坟北头”八亩地，每年连投资的本钱都收不回来，送给人家也没人要，农民就叫它是“赔钱岭”。
      一九五二年，村里办了个先锋农业生产合作社，三年来，农业生产合作社利用兴修蓄水池、使用新农具、改良土壤、改进耕作技术等办法，使全社里二百多亩薄地都变成了良田。去年先锋农业生产合作社的秋地产量，每亩平均到二石零六升，比建社前提高了百分之八十七点三，是冀家岭村自古以来未有的大丰收。杨里锁入社时首先提出要把他的八亩地送给社里，他说明不分红也不负担农业税。当时，社员们都不愿意要，后来还是社长李长成说服大家留下了。这块“赔钱岭”经过农业生产合作社三年的深耕细作，改良土壤，多施底肥，结果是年年增产，特别是去年增产更加显著，种的谷子每亩收了一石八斗，比过去最好的年景提高了三倍半，社员们都高兴地说：“赔钱岭”到了农业生产合作社的手里就变成“肥田岭”了。
                              （连治水等）
      孤儿也有余粮了
    新疆省乌鲁木齐县东沟乡杨志新农业生产合作社秋收分配后，社员们和周围农民到处谈论着赵国珍的故事。
    赵国珍是一个十四岁的无依无靠的孤儿。七岁时，父亲被地主重打一顿后生病死了，母亲也因生活无着改嫁，孤苦伶仃的赵国珍只好给别人放牛维持生活。去年三月，村里办了农业生产合作社，大家便决定把他吸收到社里去。
    赵国珍参加农业生产合作社后，因为年纪小，劳动力弱，社里只分配给他一些能做的活。如春耕时，就让他耙地、压地。夏锄时，大家拔草、锄草，就让他把锄掉的草抱到田埂上。收割时，大家割，就让他捆捆子。这样，他每天也可得到四五个工分。九月底他割草时，把手割破了，社里还从公益金中拿出六万元来给他治疗。平时没吃的、没穿的，社里就帮助他解决。因此，赵国珍在农业生产合作社的关怀和帮助下，一天比一天愉快，一天比一天活泼了。干活的劲儿也越来越大。
    去年农业生产合作社的庄稼丰收，赵国珍分得了九石多粮食，他除了缴公粮、还账和自吃外，还向社里投资了三石粮食，又卖给国家一石余粮，自己又做了一身棉衣。
    老汉真正佩服了
    一九五三年秋后，山西省朔县仓房坪村酝酿建立农业生产合作社时，解开老汉认为：全家男女六个劳动力，还有三匹好牲口和六十亩地，像这样人强马壮的人家，唯有单干好，所以他不愿入社。大儿子解继仁却认为单干再好也不如农业生产合作社力量大，他坚决要入社。老汉的二儿子解二白感觉农业生产合作社初办，好、坏还不一定，他主张参加互助组，既能克服一般困难，又能多打粮，这样一来，父子三人只好各走各的路。
    春耕开始了，农业生产合作社因没经验，工作有些混乱，解老汉一看，便断言农业生产合作社办不好，并宣布“要到秋后看高低！”可是不久农业生产合作社建立了各种制度，工作很快就走上了轨道。及时种完了豌豆、小麦和谷子。解二白参加的互助组的生产也进行的较好，唯有单干的解老汉换不到工，没有人帮助他送粪下种，样样庄稼都落在后面。
    夏天雨水大，河水淹没了很多庄稼，解老汉原指望和农业生产合作社比高低的六亩麦茬糜子地也被水淹了。农业生产合作社受淹的禾苗，经过社员的突击洗苗扶苗，施追肥等很快就转青了；解老汉的禾苗，因人手少弄不过来，又加苗小淹的重，只好改种小莜麦，可是不几天又被水淹了。后来还是农业生产合作社帮助他买了荞麦种，才又种上。到秋收时，农业生产合作社的庄稼熟的早，很快就收完毕，解老汉的六亩荞麦和一部杂田不等成熟就冻死在地里了。解老汉连种籽、肥料等一共投资了八石五斗多粮食，结果只收了五石粮食，连本钱都不够。大儿子解继仁在农业生产合作社分得了二十二石粮食，解二白在互助组也收了九石粮食。
  　解老汉经过这一年的事实教育，从心里佩服了农业生产合作社，现在他和二儿子解二白不仅一再地要求入社，而且还到处宣传农业生产合作社的好处，动员大家入社。
                                （陈大树）
    自留地的故事
    去年春上，安徽省六安县美景农业生产合作社建立的时候，社员李常友只入社一石五斗地，其余四斗自己留下了，大伙都劝他不要留这些田，但他只当做耳边风。
    他是个中农，耕畜农具样样有，当互助组酝酿办社时，他感到左右为难：入社吧，人家都有两三
  个劳动力，自家只有一个劳动力，一定吃亏；不入社吧，生产上困难挺多。他又觉得在互助组里干啥都跑在人家前头，如今办社朝社会主义路上走，还
  能落后？因此，他很矛盾。
      办社的各样事情处理完毕后，其他社员都兴高采烈地下劲干活，只有李常友发愁，不知怎样来耕
  种这四斗自留田。春耕前，各个社员除了参加公积
  肥外，还把自积的肥料作价归社，只有李常友的粪留着上自己的自留田，因而引起大伙的不满。社章规定：要遵守劳动纪律，不迟到不早退，别人没啥为难，而李常友可作了难，除了按时给社里干活外，还要抽时间忙着自留田的活，累得精疲力竭；到第二天人家干活精神饱满，他却在田里打瞌睡，经常受大伙批评。
    他的四斗自留田，因为耕作粗糙，又受了干旱，到秋只收了两石二斗粮食，社里的庄稼，因耕作细致，上的肥多，都比头年增产了二成四。他入社的田，过去只收二十石稻谷，去年收了三十多石稻。分红时，他分得净稻二十一石，等于他过去一年的总收入，要是加上晚秋作物分得的粮食，比过去实足增加三成。现在，他已把四斗自留田也入了社。
      比赛三年输三年
    俞才林是浙江省杭县双林乡丁香坝村的一户中农，他的农具牲畜样样全，又有十几亩祖传地，父子二人又是强劳动力，自己又是好庄稼手，因此，他很自信自己比别人强，不相信组织起来大家富裕的道理。
      一九五二年春天，乡里办了个江洪元农业生产合作社，并订出每亩产水稻四百五十斤的增产计划。当时，俞才林就认为农业生产合作社说大话，心里想着一定要和农业生产合作社比赛一下。
    可是头一年农业生产合作社就赛赢了他，农业生产合作社不仅完成了增产计划，并且每亩还比计划多产了十五斤，而俞才林每亩只收了三百八十多斤。虽然如此，俞才林并不心服，他认为这是千年撞钟，“运气”好，心想今年输了看明年吧！谁想到第二年遇上大旱灾，五、六十天没落雨，农业生产合作社的抽水机用船驾着，那里缺水，就浇到那里，不仅农业生产合作社的田没遭旱灾，并且还帮助附近互助组和单干农民救了六百多亩稻田。俞才林既买不起抽水机，又请不到帮工车水，担水浇地，一天只能担六、七挑水，累得腰酸背痛，还只看见一个水印，眼看着一丘丘的田干裂开了。这时，俞才林才不得不承认农业生产合作社比自己单干强。这
  一年社里又获得丰收，每亩水稻比俞才林多收一百多斤。这次俞才林虽然认输了，但是他并未要求入社，他想：还是再碰一年吧。一九五四年又遇到了
  一场大水灾。俞才林在大水面前又是束手无策，看着大水插不上秧，而农业生产合作社人多力量大，很快排除了渍水，抢种了一百三十多亩晚稻，大水过后，社里的晚稻却长得绿油油的比那一年都好，每亩平均收了六百多斤。江洪元农业生产合作社连年战胜各种自然灾害获得丰收的事实，像磁石一样吸引着周围的农民走合作化的道路，因此，江洪元农业生产合作社已由开始建社的十一户扩大到一百五十户。这时俞才林再也不愿单干了，他也报名参加了新建的丁香坝村农业生产合作社。
                                  （李冬野）
    杨凤怀劳动热情提高了
    杨凤怀是热河承德县三合村的一个农民，今年三十二岁。土地改革前是个贫农，土地很少。从二十岁起就租地种，辛勤劳动打下的粮食，要交给地主一半，自己却得吃糠咽菜。年年苦干年年挨饿。这种日子使他厌倦了劳动。他想：“反正是不够吃，不如少受点累。”从此他就不好好侍弄土地了。早晨太阳照到房檐，也不起床，锄地时拿着锄头玩或坐到树荫下聊天、睡觉；甚至一担水不挑，一根柴不拾。每逢无米下锅的时候，就打骂妻子出气。
    解放后，杨凤怀分到了八亩土地。但是这时候，他的懒惰已成了习性，又加没有耕畜，还是不好好劳动。他的地里年年草比苗高，秋后三四个月就没吃的，依靠政府救济。去年春天，村里办了农业生产合作社，他参加合作社后，起初还是很懒，合作社天天派人去喊他下地，后来经过社里不断教育和帮助，他才感到今天不是从前了，劳动态度开始有了转变。这时候合作社又公布了半年来的账目，他听了之后，很后悔。别的社员都作了一百多个劳动日，他才作七十来个劳动日。他后悔不该迟到和偷懒，既影响了自己的收入，又觉得像欠社里点什么，心里老不安。从此，杨凤怀就下定决心要改掉自己的懒病。为了能够听清号声，保证及时起床、下地，他借了一间离合作社近的房子，克服了迟到的现象。有一次社里的马病了，需要有人在夜间照看，他主动地担任了这个工作，细心照看病马，因此受到了社的表扬。以后他的劳动热情更高了，并且逐渐地培养起劳动的习惯。八月间，他的背上长了疮不能干活，他也到地里去；自己没有事情，就到社里给马添添料或扫扫院子。因为他的劳动态度变好了，曾受到社的三次表扬，还被选为生产小组的副组长。
