As a column:

    Before liberation, agricultural scientists in our country mostly copied agricultural science works from countries such as England, America, France, and Japan to teach students, and imported foreign plant and animal varieties for experimental cultivation. They rarely paid attention to the agricultural science heritage left by our motherland over thousands of years. As a result, many excellent varieties created by the working people of the motherland over thousands of years disappeared; books on agriculture and forestry science were filled with praise for European and American cultivation techniques; and agricultural education was not closely integrated with agricultural production.

    Since liberation, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and the government, agricultural production in our country has greatly developed. After 1951, agricultural scientists in various regions, under the leadership of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, went to the countryside to summarize the farmers' experiences in achieving high yields, which played a significant role in improving the level of agricultural production in our country. As a result, the level of agricultural science in our country has also been raised a step further.

    Now, the Party and the government are calling on us to pay attention to the agricultural science heritage of our motherland, which is very correct.

    The agricultural science heritage left by our motherland over thousands of years can be roughly divided into three aspects: first, records of agricultural production experience in ancient books; second, advanced production experiences of farmers in various regions; and third, excellent varieties scattered in various places.

    Our ancestors accumulated rich agricultural production experience in their long-term labor and cultivated many excellent varieties. Records of these experiences and varieties are scattered in various ancient books, as well as county and prefectural chronicles. There are numerous scattered records of agricultural production in ancient books such as the "Book of Songs," "Erya," "Lüshi Chunqiu," "Qimin Yaoshu," "Book of Tree Planting," "Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings of Ancient and Modern Times - Flora," "Guangzhi," and "Hua Jing." "Ju Lu" by Han Yanzhi of the Song Dynasty is a classic work written eight hundred years ago about citrus varieties, cultivation, harvesting, storage, and transportation. It is the earliest and most complete citrus technology masterpiece in the world. There are also many other monographs such as "Litchi Spectrum," "Chrysanthemum Spectrum," and "Peony Spectrum." In order to carry forward the agricultural heritage of the motherland, it is necessary to designate specialists in scientific research institutions and agricultural and forestry colleges with the necessary conditions to systematically sort out and study these ancient books so that they can serve the development of agricultural production.

    The rich production experience accumulated by Chinese farmers is known to all countries. For example, in the hilly and mountainous areas of the South, farmers have created outstanding advanced methods in the utilization of slopes, the construction of terraced fields and drainage ditches, and the conservation of water and soil. In the slope areas of Hua County, Guangdong, farmers use ferns and cogongrass to cover the soil year-round, increasing the activity of microorganisms in the soil, increasing the effective components of potassium and phosphorus in the soil, maintaining soil moisture, and improving the soil's aggregate structure, so that citrus trees can produce abundant harvests every year. These experiences fully demonstrate the advanced principles of Dokuchaev and Williams regarding the relationship between biological activity and soil development. For another example, farmers in Liling County, Hunan, have created the experience of soaking seeds for one day and night, and then drying them in the shade for one or two weeks before sowing, which can make rice mature earlier. Farmers in Hangzhou soak chili and eggplant seeds in warm water for one or two days and nights in early spring, then dry them in the shade, place them in damp cloth bags for three or four days before sowing, which can make crops mature earlier and obtain high yields, and greatly increase resistance to deafness (a type of viral disease). These valuable creations of the working people are in line with Academician Lysenko's vernalization theory. In the propagation of Nanfeng oranges in Jiangxi, farmers use high branch grafting to achieve early fruiting and high yields. In the propagation of Sweet Oranges in Xupu, Hunan, farmers adopt the method of planting seedlings from the base of the trunk on the mountain, creating plants with deep roots, longevity, high yields, and drought resistance. These experiences are consistent with the theory of the stages of plant individual development created by the great Michurin.

    In order to carry forward the agricultural heritage of the motherland, it is necessary to systematically, with organization and leadership, and in a planned way, summarize these advanced production experiences of farmers. This work requires the close integration of agricultural scientific research institutions, experimental farms, and agricultural and forestry colleges with farmers, labor models, and production experts. Organized agricultural mutual aid teams and production cooperatives should take the lead in doing this. The farmers' experience symposiums held annually in the northeastern provinces are an effective method for summarizing advanced experiences.

    Agricultural and forestry colleges can jointly organize comprehensive visiting teams with agricultural scientific research institutions to work in the countryside. In this regard, the experiences of the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute and Beijing Agricultural University can be used as a reference. When conducting investigations and visits, it is necessary to take care of the farmers' production work and not go to the countryside in an unorganized and unled manner. Otherwise, it will not only disperse the strength of scientific research workers, but also increase the trouble for farmers. Of course, if necessary, agricultural scientists can also invite agricultural labor models from various regions to come to agricultural colleges or agricultural science research institutes in the off-season to hold symposiums, where everyone can discuss and summarize their experiences.

    Our excellent crop varieties, after thousands of years of natural selection by farmers, are very rich. We have many excellent varieties of rice, wheat, soybeans, sesame, mulberry, and tea, scattered in the fields of farmers. The Feicheng peach in Shandong, the Laiyang pear, the Guaglǜ litchi in Zengcheng, Guangdong, and the seedless white grape in Turpan, Xinjiang, are also well-known throughout the country. These excellent varieties have not been collected, sorted, propagated, and promoted in the past. At the same time, some varieties were "secretly passed down from generation to generation" in feudal society, so that many valuable varieties have been lost. The Guaglǜ litchi in Zengcheng used to be private property, used exclusively to curry favor with warlords and landlords, and was not allowed to be passed on to outsiders. Now only half of the old tree remains. Starting in 1952, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Agriculture led scientific workers in various regions to conduct investigations and select varieties and strains, which is a very important task. In the future, under the leadership of the Party and the government, we should widely mobilize the masses, labor models, and production experts to select excellent varieties through self-reporting, mutual reporting, and comparative selection, and collect these varieties, preserve, propagate, and promote them by region. Agricultural and forestry colleges and agricultural scientific research institutions in various regions should also participate in the work of collecting varieties and strengthen scientific research in this area. Because only after understanding the advantages of indigenous varieties can we further improve these varieties. Mass variety collection and selection was a major part of the Soviet Union's agricultural development. One Soviet expert, after inspecting the agricultural situation in various provinces of China, said: "We are sitting on a mountain of gold and do not know the value of gold." This sentence is both criticism and encouragement for us. Therefore, we must regard the development of the resources of excellent agricultural varieties in our country as one of the important tasks of current agricultural scientific research.

    In order to do this work well, I believe that under the unified leadership of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and relevant central departments, in areas with different climates, nurseries for annual crop raw materials, specimen gardens for perennial crop varieties and strains, and forest botanical gardens should be established to systematically carry out collection, propagation, preservation, observation, comparison, recording and other work, and gradually focus on clarifying the developmental characteristics, biological characteristics and value to the national economy of various varieties and strains. Only in this way is it possible to further exert the effectiveness of indigenous varieties and strains, cultivate new varieties in accordance with Michurin's advanced scientific theories, and continuously improve yields and quality. In this way, whatever research materials are needed by scientific workers in various regions, the state can supply these materials in the true sense of the word. The Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries regard agricultural crop varieties and strains as valuable wealth publicly owned by the people, and attach great importance to the collection, preservation and promotion of varieties. After our country has carried out this work, we can also exchange variety raw materials with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, thereby enriching the agricultural and forestry varieties needed by mankind and meeting the living requirements of mankind.

    We must have a correct attitude in learning from the agricultural heritage of our motherland. We are learning from the agricultural heritage of our motherland in order to further understand the greatness of our motherland, enhance national self-esteem, promote the enthusiasm of patriotism, and to greatly improve the level of agricultural production and agricultural technology in our country. However, when we learn from the heritage of our motherland, we must never have a complacent attitude, or even produce a restorationist ideology, and be complacent. Carrying forward the heritage of the motherland must be combined with learning from the advanced scientific theories of the Soviet Union. This is because Soviet agriculture is the most developed and most advanced agriculture in the world today. Soviet agriculture is the crystallization of the wisdom of scientists such as Michurin, Williams, and Lysenko and the production experience of generations of working farmers, and it is also the crystallization of the achievements of world agricultural science. This is because only under the guidance of the advanced scientific theory of dialectical materialism can we carry forward the agricultural and forestry science heritage left by our motherland for thousands of years, rapidly develop agricultural production in our country, and rapidly improve the level of agricultural science in our country.

    发扬祖国的农业科学遗产
    华中农学院园艺系教授  章文才
    解放前，我国的农业科学工作者多抄袭英、美、法、日等国的农业科学著作教给学生，输入外国的动植物品种来试验栽培，而对于祖国数千年来遗留下来的农业科学遗产，则很少予以重视。因此，祖国劳动人民千百年来所创造的优良品种，消失许多；农林科学方面的书籍，充满了歌颂欧美栽培技术的东西；农业教育没有同农业生产密切结合起来。
    解放以后，由于党和政府的正确领导，我国的农业生产有了很大的发展。一九五一年以后，各地农业科学工作者，在中国科学院和华北农业科学研究所的倡导下，纷纷下乡，总结农民的丰产经验，这对于我国农业生产水平的提高起了很重大的作用。我国的农业科学水平也从而提高了一步。
    现在，党和政府号召我们重视祖国的农业科学遗产，这是非常正确的。
    祖国几千年来遗留下来的农业科学遗产，大致说来有三个方面：一、古籍中关于农业生产经验的记载；二、各地农民的先进生产经验；三、散落各地的优良品种。
    我们的祖先在长期劳动中积聚了丰富的农业生产经验，培育了许多优良品种，关于这些经验和品种的记载，散见在各种古籍以及县志、府志当中。“诗经”、“尔雅”、“吕氏春秋”、“齐民要术”、“种树书”、“古今图书集成草木典”、“广志”、“花镜”等古籍中，关于农业生产的零散的记载，非常之多。宋韩彦直的“橘录”，是一部在八百年前就写成的关于柑橘品种、栽培、采摘、贮藏、运输的经典著作，是世界上最早最完备的柑橘技术名著。其他如“荔枝谱”、“菊谱”、“牡丹谱”等等专著尚多。为了发扬祖国的农业遗产，必须指定专人在有条件的科学研究机关和农林院校，分别有系统地整理和研究这些古籍，使它们为发展农业生产服务。
    我国农民积累了丰富的生产经验，是各国都知道的。例如在南方的丘陵山岳地带，农民对坡地的利用、梯田撩壕的设置、水土的保持等方面，都创造了世界上杰出的先进方法。广东化县一带的坡地，农民用蕨芒草来终年覆盖土壤，增加土壤中微生物群落的活动，增加土壤中钾磷的有效成分，保持土壤水分，改进土壤的团粒结构，使柑橘树年年丰产。这些经验，充分地证明了杜库查也夫、威廉姆士的生物活动对土壤发育关系的先进原理。再如湖南醴陵县的农民，创造了先浸种一昼夜，阴干一、二周以后播种，就可以使得水稻提前成熟的经验。杭州农民在早春播种辣椒、茄子，用温水浸种一、二昼夜，然后阴干，在潮湿的布袋中，放置三四天再去播种，这样就可以使作物早熟并得到丰产，而且对于聋病（一种毒素病）的抵抗力可以大大增加。劳动人民的这些宝贵的创造，是符合于李森科院士的春化原理的。江西南丰橘的繁殖，农民应用了高枝靠接的方法，得到早结果和丰产。湖南溆浦甜橙的繁殖，农民采用了低压在主干基部所发出来的幼苗上山栽植，创造了深根、长寿、丰产、不怕干旱的植株。这些经验，是和伟大的米丘林所创造的植物个体发育的阶段性学说相符合的。
    为了发扬祖国农业遗产，必须有组织、有领导、有步骤地总结农民的这些先进生产经验。这项工作，须要农业科学研究机关、试验场、农林院校，同农民群众、劳动模范、生产能手，互相紧密地结合才能作好。组织起来的农业互助组和生产合作社，应当带头来做。东北各省每年举行的农民经验座谈会是一种总结先进经验的有效方法。
    农林院校可以和农业科学研究机关共同组织综合性的访问队下乡工作。在这方面，华北农业科学研究所和北京农业大学的经验，是可以借鉴的。在进行调查访问的时候，一定要照顾到农民的生产工作，不能无组织、无领导地下乡。否则，既分散了科学研究工作者的力量，又增加了农民的麻烦。当然，如果有必要，农业科学工作者也可以邀请各地农业劳动模范，在农闲的时候，到农学院或农业科学研究所来开座谈会，大家讨论和总结他们的经验。
    我们的优良农作物品种，经过千百年来农民的自然选择，是非常丰富的。我们有很多优良的水稻、小麦、豆菽、芝麻、桑、茶的品种，散存在农民的田里。山东的肥城桃，莱阳梨，广东增城的挂绿荔枝，新疆吐鲁蕃的无籽白葡萄等等，也是各地闻名的。这些优良品种，由于过去没有经过搜集、整理、繁殖和推广，同时有些品种在封建社会里是“祖代秘传”的，以致很多宝贵的品种，已经失传。增城的挂绿荔枝，过去是私人的财产，专门用来向军阀地主献媚的，不许外传，现在只存留半株老树了。一九五二年开始，中国科学院、农业部领导着各地的科学工作者，进行调查和选择品种、品系的工作，这是非常重要的一件事情。今后在党和政府的领导下，应当广泛地发动群众、劳动模范、生产能手等，用自报、互报、评比选择的方式选择优良品种，并搜集这些品种，分区保存、繁殖和推广。各地农林院校、农业科学研究机关，也应该参加搜集品种的工作，并加强这方面的科学研究工作。因为只有在了解固有品种的优点以后，才能进一步提高这些品种。群众性的品种搜集和选择曾是苏联发展农业生产的主要一环，有一位苏联专家在视察了我们中国各省农业情况以后曾讲过：我们是坐在黄金的山上而不知道黄金的宝贵。这句话对于我们是批评，也是鼓励。因此，我们必须将发扬祖国优良农业品种的资源，视为当前农业科学研究的重要工作之一。
    为了做好这个工作，我以为应在中国科学院和中央有关部门的统一领导下，在不同气候的地区，成立一年生作物原始材料圃，及多年生作物品种、品系标本园和森林植物园，有系统地进行搜集、繁殖、保存、观察、比较、记载等工作，逐步有重点地明了各种品种、品系的发育特性、生物学特性和它对于国民经济上的价值。只有这样，才有可能进一步发挥固有品种、品系的效能，按照米丘林的先进科学学说，培育新品种，不断地提高产量和品质。这样，各地科学工作者需要什么研究材料，国家就可以名副其实地来供应这些材料。苏联以及各人民民主国家把农业作物品种、品系，作为人民公有的宝贵财富，非常重视品种的搜集、保存和推广。我国进行了这一工作以后，还可以和苏联及各人民民主国家交换品种原始材料，从而丰富人类所需要的农林品种，满足人类的生活要求。
    学习祖国的农业遗产，必须有正确态度。我们学习祖国的农业遗产，是为了进一步认识祖国的伟大，提高民族自尊心，发扬爱国主义的热情，是为了把我国的农业生产和农业技术水平大大地提高一步。但是，我们在学习祖国遗产的时候，决不能有骄傲自满的情绪，甚至产生复古思想，故步自封。发扬祖国遗产必须和学习苏联的先进科学理论相结合。这是因为，苏联农业是今天世界上最发达、最先进的农业。苏联农业是米丘林、威廉姆士、李森科等科学家的智慧和世世代代劳动农民的生产经验相结合的结晶，也是世界农业科学成就的结晶。这是因为，只有在辩证唯物主义的先进科学理论的指导下，才能发扬祖国几千年存留下来的农林科学遗产，迅速地发展我国的农业生产，迅速地提高我国的农业科学水平。
