Xinhua News Agency, January 17th dispatch from New York: United Nations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld returned to the United Nations headquarters in New York on the evening of the 13th. On the 14th, Hammarskjöld issued a statement at a press conference regarding his talks with Premier Zhou Enlai in Beijing, saying: “I can say that our negotiations were very thorough. Mr. Zhou Enlai also explained to me his views on other issues related to the current international tensions.”

The statement also said: “Mr. Zhou Enlai and I hope to be able to continue our contacts. ... The door has been opened, and if all parties can exercise restraint, the door can remain open.”

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 17th: Indian newspapers have commented on Premier Zhou Enlai's talks with United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld in Beijing.

The "Hindustan Times" editorial on the 14th wrote: "The optimistic point in the communiqué is that they 'also discussed the question of easing world tensions.' This is a question of particular importance today. The United States may be very concerned about the issue of American 'pilots,' but what the rest of the world, especially the people of Asia, are primarily concerned with is how to ease world tensions." The editorial welcomed the outcome of the talks and pointed out that the Beijing talks were a "concrete and practical step" in easing world tensions.

The "Today" newspaper editorial on the 12th believed that the Beijing talks would help ease international tensions.

The "Indian Express" said in an editorial on the 12th, "The fact that 'both sides found the talks to be 'beneficial' and hope to 'continue contact' is an encouraging point." The newspaper hoped that the outcome of the Beijing talks "may lead to a broader understanding."

The "Assam Tribune" editorial on the 13th said, "Mr. Zhou Enlai's reception of the United Nations Secretary-General in Beijing demonstrated his magnanimity as a statesman." The editorial also said that those Americans "are serving sentences in China after being convicted of espionage by the courts. As such, the Chinese Premier could well think that the United Nations has no right to interfere in this case, especially since it has been kept out of the United Nations due to America's stubborn disregard for the legitimate demands of the People's Republic of China."

The "Hindustan Standard" editorial on the 12th said that the Chinese have reason not to compromise on the issue of American spies. The United Nations resolution on this issue seems to many to be a regrettable cause of increased tension. "The United Nations often seems to be in a position of taking sides." When discussing the issues that cause international tensions that should be widely discussed, the newspaper mentioned such a question: "Thousands of Chinese detained in South Korea by United Nations forces, ignoring protests from Beijing, have been forcibly sent to Taiwan."

    哈马舍尔德就他同周总理的会谈发表声明
    印度报纸认为会谈有助于国际紧张局势的缓和
    【新华社十七日讯】纽约消息：联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德已在十三日晚回到纽约联合国总部。十四日，哈马舍尔德在记者招待会上就他在北京同周恩来总理举行的会谈发表声明说：“我可以说我们的谈判非常透彻。周恩来先生还向我说明他对有关目前国际紧张局势的其他问题的意见。”
    声明并说：“周恩来先生和我希望能够继续我们的联系。……大门已经打开，如果所有方面都能自制，大门能够继续开着。”
    【新华社新德里十七日电】印度报纸就周恩来总理同联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德在北京的会谈发表了评论。
    “印度文汇报”十四日的社论写道：会谈公报中令人乐观的一点是他们“还讨论了缓和世界紧张形势的问题。这是今天居于特别重要地位的问题。美国可能非常关心美国的‘飞行员’问题，但是世界其他地方尤其是亚洲人民所主要关心的是缓和世界紧张形势的办法。”社论在欢迎会谈的结果时指出：北京会谈结果是在缓和世界紧张局势方面的一个“具体而实际的步骤”。
    “今天报”十二日发表的社论里认为，北京会谈将有助于缓和国际紧张局势。
    “印度快报”十二日在社论中说，“双方都发现会谈是‘有益的’，而且希望‘继续接触’，这个事实是令人鼓舞的一点。”这家报纸希望北京会谈结果“可能导致更广泛的谅解”。
      “阿萨姆论坛报”十三日发表社论说，“周恩来先生在北京接待联合国秘书长一事表现了他作为一个政治家的宏大的气量。”社论又说，那些美国人“在被法院判定犯有间谍罪以后正在中国服刑。既是这样，中国总理就可以这样认为：联合国无权干预这个案件，特别是因为由于美国的固执不顾中华人民共和国的合法要求而把它摒于联合国之外”。
    “印度斯坦旗报”十二日的社论说，中国人有理由在美国间谍案件问题上不妥协。联合国关于这个问题的决议在许多人看来是增加紧张局势的令人遗憾的原因。“联合国时常看来好像是处在一个偏袒一方的地位”。这家报纸在谈到应该广泛讨论造成国际紧张局势的问题时，提到这样一个问题：“数以千计的在南朝鲜被联合国军拘留的中国人，不顾北京提出来的抗议，被强迫送到台湾去了”。
