Many supply and marketing cooperatives in Huangyan, Wenling, Yongjia, and Yuhuan counties of Zhejiang Province have recently been actively employing mobile teams, peddlers, and cargo boats to deliver production and living materials needed by farmers to remote villages. In the past, on market days in Dalumao Street, Baifeng Township, Wenling County, only peddlers brought a small quantity of expensive items like matches, cigarettes, and soy sauce. The market would disperse before ten o'clock. The masses called it a "dew market." Farmers had to travel five or six miles to Ruoheng and Tangxia to buy what they needed. Now that the supply and marketing cooperative is also supplying goods, the farmers are satisfied and say, "The 'dew market' has become a 'big city.'" The cadres of the mobile sales team of the Toutuo Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Huangyan County braved the snow to cross the Toutuo River and sell goods village after village along a three-mile-long mud road. In one day, they sold goods worth seven million yuan. Many farmers in Jinqing Township, Huangyan County, happily said after the supply and marketing cooperative strengthened its supply of materials: "In the past, to buy a pair of scissors for a daughter's wedding, one had to go to Hangzhou; now, whatever you need is available at your doorstep."

    把货物送到偏僻乡村
    浙江省黄岩、温岭、永嘉、玉环等县的许多供销合作社，最近积极采用流动组、货郎担、百货船等方式，把农民需要的生产资料和生活资料送到偏僻的乡村。温岭县白峰乡大路毛街，过去每逢市集，只有小贩挑去又少又贵的火柴、香烟、酱油等物品，不到十点钟，人就散完了。群众称它为“露水市”。农民们缺少的东西，只好到五六里路以外的箬横、塘下去买。现在供销合作社也来供应货物，农民们满意地说：“露水市”变成“大城市”了。黄岩县头陀供销合作社售货流动组的干部冒雪渡过头陀江，经过三里路长的泥路，一村又一村地售货。一天他们就买了七百万元的货物。黄岩县金清乡许多农民在供销合作社加强了物资供应工作以后高兴地说：“过去嫁女儿，买把剪刀要跑到杭州去；现在你要的东西，门口都有。”　（本报浙江记者站）
