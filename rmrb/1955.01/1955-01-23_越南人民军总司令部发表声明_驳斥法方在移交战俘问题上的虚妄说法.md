Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 20th: The General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army issued a statement on January 19th, refuting the false claims made by the French Union Forces regarding the transfer of prisoners of war. The full text of the statement is as follows:

From the beginning of the patriotic war until the conclusion of the Geneva Armistice Agreements, the Vietnam People's Army has consistently and correctly implemented the lenient policy of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam towards prisoners of war. Every year, the Vietnam People's Army releases thousands of Vietnamese prisoners of war after a period of education, allowing them to return home. Thousands more European and African prisoners of war have also been released or repatriated. According to incomplete figures, the Vietnam People's Army released or repatriated a total of 4,026 European and African prisoners of war from 1950 until the signing of the armistice agreement. Following the victorious offensive on the Vietnam-China border, the Vietnam People's Army allowed the French Union Forces to come to That Khe on October 19, 1950, to transport 128 wounded prisoners of war. After the Dien Bien Phu campaign, the Vietnam People's Army again allowed the French Union Forces to come to the site to transport 853 wounded prisoners of war and 27 French medical personnel who cared for these wounded. Subsequently, according to the agreement reached between the two sides at the Trung Gia conference, the Vietnam People's Army transferred another 546 sick and wounded prisoners of war to the French Union Forces. After the Geneva Conference, the Vietnam People's Army earnestly fulfilled the agreed-upon terms, transferring to the French Union Forces 12,173 prisoners of war captured in Vietnam and 587 political prisoners, as well as 695 prisoners of war captured in Laos. Including the 546 sick and wounded prisoners of war released after the Trung Gia conference, the total number of prisoners of war handed over by the Vietnam People's Army to the French Union Forces reached 13,414, including 9,247 Europeans and Africans. This total includes one brigadier general, three colonels, twelve lieutenant colonels, thirty-eight majors, 530 officers from captain to second lieutenant, and 3,523 sergeants, including 2,706 Europeans and Africans.

During the release of prisoners of war, no prisoner of war expressed any complaints about the transfer work or the treatment given by the Vietnam People's Army. The International Supervisory and Control Commission sent mobile inspection teams to Viet Tri and Cam Xa (two locations for the release of prisoners of war - Vietnam News Agency note) three times to conduct investigations. It considered all practices related to the release of prisoners of war to be correct and recognized the lenient policy of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam towards prisoners of war. Brigadier General de Castries (commander of the French Union Forces at Dien Bien Phu, captured during the offensive launched by the Vietnam People's Army and released after the signing of the Geneva Armistice Agreements - Vietnam News Agency note), in answering questions from journalist de Castran, said: "I have nothing to complain about regarding my detention." Lieutenant Colonel Trecar Andr√©, commander of the northern region of Dien Bien Phu, said: "Frankly speaking, since I was captured on May 7, 1954, I have been treated very well and fed well. Despite countless difficulties, people have clearly demonstrated their determination to improve our living conditions." Prisoner of war Darbero Jean, who was captured near Nho Quan District, Ninh Binh Province in 1953, said: "When my thigh was injured, the Vietnamese soldiers took me back and treated me like a friend; they didn't hate me." Fifty-three prisoners of war wrote in a letter to President Ho Chi Minh in August 1954: "Mr. President, thanks to your lenient policy, we are well fed and clothed; we live in large and well-ventilated houses; we have never been punished; on the contrary, cadres and soldiers treat us very well and constantly show their willingness to make our lives more pleasant." Released prisoners of war wrote thousands of letters to President Ho Chi Minh and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam expressing their gratitude. These are undeniable facts. However, on the side of the French Union Forces, there is much conclusive evidence that they have not faithfully implemented the provisions of the Geneva Conference and the Trung Gia Conference regarding the issue of prisoners of war.

It is worth noting that, until now, the French Union Forces are still detaining prisoners of war and political prisoners and are unwilling to hand them over to our side. On December 14, 1954, the delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army in the Vietnam Central Joint Ceasefire Committee handed over a list of 10,467 prisoners of war who had not yet been released to the delegation of the French Union Forces, of which 6,931 were mentioned in the list of prisoners of war handed over to the delegation of the Vietnam People's Army before August 20, 1954, and 3,536 are, to our knowledge, still being held by the French Union Forces. On November 8, 1954, two months after the expiration of the prisoner of war release period on September 5, 1954, at the request of the delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army, the International Commission sent a mobile inspection team to the prison on Con Son Island (an important prison of the French Union Forces) to conduct an investigation. The mobile inspection team personally met with 70 prisoners of war and political prisoners detained on Con Son Island. Under questioning by the International Commission's mobile inspection team, Major Blanc, the warden of the prison, admitted the above facts and handed over a list of 130 prisoners of war to the mobile inspection team, most of whom were already on the list of prisoners of war whose release was requested by the delegation of the Vietnam People's Army at the meeting of the Central Joint Ceasefire Committee on October 16, 1954.

We do not want to recount here the consistent and well-known inhumane treatment of prisoners of war by the French Union Forces in the past. Despite the agreement signed by both sides on July 16, 1954, to improve the living conditions of prisoners of war, the French Union Forces are continuing their previous policy. During the International Team's investigation of the prison on Con Son Island, Warden Major Blanc had to admit that on August 21, 1954, his personnel had thrown 22 grenades into the cells of prisoners of war and political prisoners. When asked about the system of treating prisoners in this prison, Major Blanc admitted that the regulations announced in 1862 were still being implemented and that he had never received any agreements signed at the Geneva Conference or at the Trung Gia Conference from his superiors.

The results of the investigation on Con Son Island fully demonstrated the cruel system of treating prisoners by the French Union Forces and also showed that, until now, the French Union Forces are still detaining prisoners of war and political prisoners and are unwilling to hand them over to our side. This is a serious violation of Article 21 of the Geneva Armistice Agreements and the provisions reached at the Trung Gia Conference on July 16 and August 14, 1954.

The above facts are the true situation between the Vietnam People's Army and the French Union Forces regarding the treatment of prisoners of war and the repatriation of prisoners of war. However, many prominent figures on the French Union side have recently insisted that the Vietnam People's Army has not released all the prisoners of war of the French Union Forces. Therefore, we think it is necessary to recount here some of the figures they have put forward:

On July 28, 1954, the spokesman for the French military headquarters estimated that the number of French and Vietnamese prisoners of war who should be released in North Vietnam would be between 5,000 and 6,000 (United Press International, July 28, 1954). This number is less than half the number of prisoners of war handed over by the Vietnam People's Army to the French Union side. However, on August 6, 1954, General Salan claimed that the number of missing military personnel of the French Union Forces was 40,172.

On August 19, 1954, the French Indo-China Federal Member States Relations Department announced that from December 19, 1946, to July 14, 1954, the total number of French Union Forces personnel captured by the Vietnam People's Army was 27,582.

On November 19, 1954, French parliamentarian Bino said that 25,000 French prisoners of war may have died in prison and that only 10,000 prisoners of war were released out of more than 30,000 prisoners of war. (French Asia Radio broadcast on November 19, 1954)

The above-mentioned contradictory statements and figures made by authoritative and responsible persons on the side of the French Union show that these are completely slanderous and that these figures are completely unfounded. The purpose of all these actions is only to deceive French and world public opinion, to conceal the benevolent and lenient policy of President Ho Chi Minh and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, to conceal our policy of respecting the Geneva Armistice Agreements, and at the same time to conceal the serious actions of the French Union Forces in violating the Geneva Agreements, specifically, to condone the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in continuing to detain prisoners of war and political prisoners without handing them all over to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The fact that the above statement is still often recounted after the International Commission conducted an investigation at the prison on Con Son Island more clearly proves that the responsible persons of the French Union Forces intentionally concealed the facts and deceived public opinion.

We, in the name of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army, emphatically declare that the Vietnam People's Army has earnestly fulfilled the Geneva Armistice Agreements, correctly implemented the lenient policy of President Ho Chi Minh and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, has released all prisoners of war, and has not detained a single prisoner of war. On the contrary, the French Union Forces are still detaining our personnel and are unwilling to return all the detained prisoners of war and civilians to us in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Agreements and the agreements reached at the Trung Gia Conference. On the other hand, we urge the General Headquarters of the French Union Forces to return all prisoners of war and civilians who are still being detained in its prisons.
