Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 20th: The General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army issued a statement on January 19th, refuting the false claims made by the French Union Forces regarding the transfer of prisoners of war. The full text of the statement is as follows:

From the beginning of the patriotic war until the conclusion of the Geneva Armistice Agreements, the Vietnam People's Army has consistently and correctly implemented the lenient policy of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam towards prisoners of war. Every year, the Vietnam People's Army releases thousands of Vietnamese prisoners of war after a period of education, allowing them to return home. Thousands more European and African prisoners of war have also been released or repatriated. According to incomplete figures, the Vietnam People's Army released or repatriated a total of 4,026 European and African prisoners of war from 1950 until the signing of the armistice agreement. Following the victorious offensive on the Vietnam-China border, the Vietnam People's Army allowed the French Union Forces to come to That Khe on October 19, 1950, to transport 128 wounded prisoners of war. After the Dien Bien Phu campaign, the Vietnam People's Army again allowed the French Union Forces to come to the site to transport 853 wounded prisoners of war and 27 French medical personnel who cared for these wounded. Subsequently, according to the agreement reached between the two sides at the Trung Gia conference, the Vietnam People's Army transferred another 546 sick and wounded prisoners of war to the French Union Forces. After the Geneva Conference, the Vietnam People's Army earnestly fulfilled the agreed-upon terms, transferring to the French Union Forces 12,173 prisoners of war captured in Vietnam and 587 political prisoners, as well as 695 prisoners of war captured in Laos. Including the 546 sick and wounded prisoners of war released after the Trung Gia conference, the total number of prisoners of war handed over by the Vietnam People's Army to the French Union Forces reached 13,414, including 9,247 Europeans and Africans. This total includes one brigadier general, three colonels, twelve lieutenant colonels, thirty-eight majors, 530 officers from captain to second lieutenant, and 3,523 sergeants, including 2,706 Europeans and Africans.

During the release of prisoners of war, no prisoner of war expressed any complaints about the transfer work or the treatment given by the Vietnam People's Army. The International Supervisory and Control Commission sent mobile inspection teams to Viet Tri and Cam Xa (two locations for the release of prisoners of war - Vietnam News Agency note) three times to conduct investigations. It considered all practices related to the release of prisoners of war to be correct and recognized the lenient policy of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam towards prisoners of war. Brigadier General de Castries (commander of the French Union Forces at Dien Bien Phu, captured during the offensive launched by the Vietnam People's Army and released after the signing of the Geneva Armistice Agreements - Vietnam News Agency note), in answering questions from journalist de Castran, said: "I have nothing to complain about regarding my detention." Lieutenant Colonel Trecar André, commander of the northern region of Dien Bien Phu, said: "Frankly speaking, since I was captured on May 7, 1954, I have been treated very well and fed well. Despite countless difficulties, people have clearly demonstrated their determination to improve our living conditions." Prisoner of war Darbero Jean, who was captured near Nho Quan District, Ninh Binh Province in 1953, said: "When my thigh was injured, the Vietnamese soldiers took me back and treated me like a friend; they didn't hate me." Fifty-three prisoners of war wrote in a letter to President Ho Chi Minh in August 1954: "Mr. President, thanks to your lenient policy, we are well fed and clothed; we live in large and well-ventilated houses; we have never been punished; on the contrary, cadres and soldiers treat us very well and constantly show their willingness to make our lives more pleasant." Released prisoners of war wrote thousands of letters to President Ho Chi Minh and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam expressing their gratitude. These are undeniable facts. However, on the side of the French Union Forces, there is much conclusive evidence that they have not faithfully implemented the provisions of the Geneva Conference and the Trung Gia Conference regarding the issue of prisoners of war.

It is worth noting that, until now, the French Union Forces are still detaining prisoners of war and political prisoners and are unwilling to hand them over to our side. On December 14, 1954, the delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army in the Vietnam Central Joint Ceasefire Committee handed over a list of 10,467 prisoners of war who had not yet been released to the delegation of the French Union Forces, of which 6,931 were mentioned in the list of prisoners of war handed over to the delegation of the Vietnam People's Army before August 20, 1954, and 3,536 are, to our knowledge, still being held by the French Union Forces. On November 8, 1954, two months after the expiration of the prisoner of war release period on September 5, 1954, at the request of the delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army, the International Commission sent a mobile inspection team to the prison on Con Son Island (an important prison of the French Union Forces) to conduct an investigation. The mobile inspection team personally met with 70 prisoners of war and political prisoners detained on Con Son Island. Under questioning by the International Commission's mobile inspection team, Major Blanc, the warden of the prison, admitted the above facts and handed over a list of 130 prisoners of war to the mobile inspection team, most of whom were already on the list of prisoners of war whose release was requested by the delegation of the Vietnam People's Army at the meeting of the Central Joint Ceasefire Committee on October 16, 1954.

We do not want to recount here the consistent and well-known inhumane treatment of prisoners of war by the French Union Forces in the past. Despite the agreement signed by both sides on July 16, 1954, to improve the living conditions of prisoners of war, the French Union Forces are continuing their previous policy. During the International Team's investigation of the prison on Con Son Island, Warden Major Blanc had to admit that on August 21, 1954, his personnel had thrown 22 grenades into the cells of prisoners of war and political prisoners. When asked about the system of treating prisoners in this prison, Major Blanc admitted that the regulations announced in 1862 were still being implemented and that he had never received any agreements signed at the Geneva Conference or at the Trung Gia Conference from his superiors.

The results of the investigation on Con Son Island fully demonstrated the cruel system of treating prisoners by the French Union Forces and also showed that, until now, the French Union Forces are still detaining prisoners of war and political prisoners and are unwilling to hand them over to our side. This is a serious violation of Article 21 of the Geneva Armistice Agreements and the provisions reached at the Trung Gia Conference on July 16 and August 14, 1954.

The above facts are the true situation between the Vietnam People's Army and the French Union Forces regarding the treatment of prisoners of war and the repatriation of prisoners of war. However, many prominent figures on the French Union side have recently insisted that the Vietnam People's Army has not released all the prisoners of war of the French Union Forces. Therefore, we think it is necessary to recount here some of the figures they have put forward:

On July 28, 1954, the spokesman for the French military headquarters estimated that the number of French and Vietnamese prisoners of war who should be released in North Vietnam would be between 5,000 and 6,000 (United Press International, July 28, 1954). This number is less than half the number of prisoners of war handed over by the Vietnam People's Army to the French Union side. However, on August 6, 1954, General Salan claimed that the number of missing military personnel of the French Union Forces was 40,172.

On August 19, 1954, the French Indo-China Federal Member States Relations Department announced that from December 19, 1946, to July 14, 1954, the total number of French Union Forces personnel captured by the Vietnam People's Army was 27,582.

On November 19, 1954, French parliamentarian Bino said that 25,000 French prisoners of war may have died in prison and that only 10,000 prisoners of war were released out of more than 30,000 prisoners of war. (French Asia Radio broadcast on November 19, 1954)

The above-mentioned contradictory statements and figures made by authoritative and responsible persons on the side of the French Union show that these are completely slanderous and that these figures are completely unfounded. The purpose of all these actions is only to deceive French and world public opinion, to conceal the benevolent and lenient policy of President Ho Chi Minh and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, to conceal our policy of respecting the Geneva Armistice Agreements, and at the same time to conceal the serious actions of the French Union Forces in violating the Geneva Agreements, specifically, to condone the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in continuing to detain prisoners of war and political prisoners without handing them all over to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The fact that the above statement is still often recounted after the International Commission conducted an investigation at the prison on Con Son Island more clearly proves that the responsible persons of the French Union Forces intentionally concealed the facts and deceived public opinion.

We, in the name of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army, emphatically declare that the Vietnam People's Army has earnestly fulfilled the Geneva Armistice Agreements, correctly implemented the lenient policy of President Ho Chi Minh and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, has released all prisoners of war, and has not detained a single prisoner of war. On the contrary, the French Union Forces are still detaining our personnel and are unwilling to return all the detained prisoners of war and civilians to us in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Agreements and the agreements reached at the Trung Gia Conference. On the other hand, we urge the General Headquarters of the French Union Forces to return all prisoners of war and civilians who are still being detained in its prisons.

### 越南人民军总司令部发表声明  驳斥法方在移交战俘问题上的虚妄说法

    越南人民军总司令部发表声明
    驳斥法方在移交战俘问题上的虚妄说法
    【新华社讯】越南通讯社河内二十日讯：越南人民军总司令部一月十九日发表了一项声明，驳斥法兰西联邦部队方面在移交战俘问题上的虚妄说法。声明全文如下：
    自从爱国战争开始到日内瓦停战协定缔结为止，越南人民军一贯正确地执行越南民主共和国政府的对待战俘的宽大政策。越南人民军每年把成千上万名的越南籍战俘在经过一个时期的教育后释放回家。还有成千上万名的欧洲和非洲籍战俘也被释放或被遣返了。根据不完全的数字，越南人民军从一九五零年起到停战协定签订时为止，一共释放或遣返了四千零二十六名欧洲和非洲籍战俘。在越南—中国边境所发动的胜利攻势以后，越南人民军曾让法兰西联邦部队方面在一九五零年十月十九日到七溪镇来把一百二十八名伤俘运走。在奠边府战役以后，越南人民军再度允许法兰西联邦部队方面到现场来把八百五十三名受伤的战俘和照顾这些伤员的二十七名法国医疗人员运走。随后，根据双方在中稼会议上达成的协议，越南人民军又移交给法兰西联邦部队方面五百四十六名病伤战俘。日内瓦会议后，越南人民军认真履行达成的条款，移交给法兰西联邦部队在越南被俘的一万二千一百七十三名战俘和五百八十七名政治犯以及在老挝被俘的六百九十五名战俘。加上在中稼会议后释放的五百四十六名病伤战俘在内，越南人民军交给法兰西联邦部队的战俘总数达一万三千四百十四人，其中有九千二百四十七名欧洲人和非洲人。这个总数内包括一名准将、三名上校、十二名中校、三十八名少校、五百三十名从上尉到少尉的军官和三千五百二十三名军士，其中有两千七百零六名欧洲人和非洲人。
    在释放战俘期间，没有一个战俘对越南人民军的移交工作或是所给的待遇表示过埋怨。越南国际监督和监察委员会曾有三次派机动视察小组到越池和岑山（释放战俘的两处地点——越南通讯社注）进行调查。它认为释放战俘的一切做法是正确的，并且承认越南民主共和国政府对待战俘的宽大政策。德卡斯特莱准将（奠边府法兰西联邦部队司令，在越南人民军发动的进攻中被俘，在日内瓦停战协定签订后被释放——越南通讯社注）在答复新闻记者德卡斯特朗的问题时说：对于我被拘留期间的情况，我没有什么可埋怨的。奠边府北部地区司令特雷卡尔·安德烈中校说：说良心话，自从一九五四年五月七日我被俘以来，我一直受到很好的待遇，吃得很好。尽管有无数的困难，人们还是明显地表现了提高我们生活条件的决心。战俘达尔贝罗·让是在一九五三年在宁平省儒关府附近被俘的，他说：当我的大腿负了伤时，越南士兵把我带回去，像朋友似的给我治疗，他们并不恨我。五十三名战俘在一九五四年八月在给胡志明主席的一封信中写道：主席先生，由于你的宽大政策，我们吃得穿得都很好；我们住的是很大的和空气很流通的房屋；我们从未受过刑罚，相反地，干部和士兵们对我们很好，而且不断表示出他们愿意让我们生活得更愉快。被释放的战俘写了数以千计的信给胡志明主席和越南民主共和国政府表示感激。这是无可否认的事实。但是，在法兰西联邦部队方面，有很多确凿的证据已经证明他们并没有忠实地执行在日内瓦会议和中稼会议上所规定的关于战俘问题的条款。
    值得注意的是，直到目前为止，法兰西联邦部队方面仍然扣留着战俘和政治犯，不愿把他们交给我方。一九五四年十二月十四日，越南中央联合停战委员会中的越南人民军总司令部代表团把一万零四百六十七名还没有释放的战俘的名单交给法兰西联邦部队代表团，其中有六千九百三十一名是在一九五四年八月二十日以前交给越南人民军代表团的战俘名单中提到的，有三千五百三十六名是据我们所知仍然被扣留在法兰西联邦部队手里的。一九五四年十一月八日，即在一九五四年九月五日释放战俘期满的两个月以后，根据越南人民军总司令部代表团的请求，国际委员会派了一个机动视察小组到昆仑岛上的监狱（法兰西联邦部队方面的一个重要监狱）进行调查。机动视察小组在那里亲自会见了被拘留在昆仑岛上的七十名战俘和政治犯。在国际委员会的机动视察小组质询之下，这个监狱的狱长布兰克少校承认了上述的事实，并且把一百三十名战俘的名单交给机动视察小组，这些战俘大部分都已列在越南人民军代表团一九五四年十月十六日在中央联合停战委员会会议上提出的要求予以释放的战俘的名单中。
    我们不想在这里追述法兰西联邦部队方面在过去对战俘所采取的一贯的和众所周知的非人道的待遇。尽管双方在一九五四年七月十六日签订了关于改善战俘生活条件的协定，但法兰西联邦部队方面仍在继续它从前的政策。在国际小组对昆仑岛的监狱进行调查时，狱长布兰克少校曾不得不承认，在一九五四年八月二十一日，他的人员曾向战俘和政治犯的牢房里投掷了二十二枚手榴弹。在询及对待这个监狱里的犯人的制度时，布兰克少校承认说，现在仍在执行在一八六二年宣布的条例，他从来没有从上级那里接到任何在日内瓦会议上和在中稼会议上签订的协议。
    在昆仑岛调查的结果，充分证明了法兰西联邦部队方面对待犯人的残酷制度，并且还显示了，直到目前为止，法兰西联邦部队方面仍然扣留有战俘和政治犯，而不肯把他们移交给我方。这严重违反了日内瓦停战协定中的第二十一条和一九五四年七月十六日以及八月十四日在中稼会议上所达成的条款。
    上述的事实就是越南人民军和法兰西联邦部队之间的关于对待战俘和遣返战俘的真实情形。但是，法兰西联邦方面的许多显要人物最近硬说越南人民军并没有释放法兰西联邦部队的全部战俘。因此，我们认为有必要在这里追述一下他们所提出的一些数字：
    一九五四年七月二十八日，法军总司令部的发言人曾估计说，应该在北越释放的法国和越南战俘的数目将有五千到六千人（合众社一九五四年七月二十八日消息）。这个数字还不到越南人民军方面移交给法兰西联邦方面的战俘数字的一半。但是，在一九五四年八月六日，萨兰将军却声称，法兰西联邦部队失踪军人的人数是四万零一百七十二人。
    一九五四年八月十九日，法国的印度支那联邦成员国关系部宣布，从一九四六年十二月十九日到一九五四年七月十四日，法兰西联邦部队被越南人民军俘去的人数一共有两万七千五百八十二人。
    一九五四年十一月十九日，法国议员比诺说，有两万五千名法国战俘可能已死在监狱中，在三万多名战俘中只有一万名战俘被释放。（法亚电台一九五四年十一月十九日广播）
    上述的由法兰西联邦方面的权威和负责人士发表的互相矛盾的声明和数字表明这些完全是诬蔑，并且表明，这些数字完全是没有根据的。这一切行动的目的只是在于欺骗法国和世界的舆论，隐瞒胡志明主席和越南民主共和国政府的仁慈的和宽大的政策，隐瞒我们尊重日内瓦停战协定的政策，同时掩饰法兰西联邦部队方面破坏日内瓦协定的严重的行为，具体说来，是纵容吴庭艳集团继续扣留战俘和政治犯，而不将他们全部移交给越南民主共和国。上述声明在国际委员会在昆仑岛监狱进行了调查以后还时常被追述，更清楚地证明了法兰西联邦部队的负责人士有意隐瞒事实，欺骗舆论。
  我们以越南人民军总司令部的名义肯定地声明，越南人民军认真地履行了日内瓦停战协定，正确地执行了胡志明主席和越南民主共和国政府的宽大政策，已经释放了全部战俘，没有扣留一名战俘。相反地，法兰西联邦部队方面仍然扣留着我们的人员，并且不愿意根据日内瓦协定的规定和在中稼会议上所达成的协议，将所有的被拘留的战俘和平民交还给我们。另一方面，我们敦促法兰西联邦部队总司令部交还所有仍然被扣留在它的监狱中的战俘和平民。
