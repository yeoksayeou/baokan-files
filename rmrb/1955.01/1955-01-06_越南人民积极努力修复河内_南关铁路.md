Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 3rd January: The roadbed of the 156-kilometer Hanoi-Nanning railway has been completely repaired. At present, the work of laying sleepers and rails has been completed on the southern section of the railway from Anyuan to Beijiang, and on the northern section from Nanning to Tongdeng. Eighteen bridges on the railway line that had been damaged have been repaired, and five stations have been built. The production of sleepers has also exceeded the planned standards.

The Vietnamese people overcame many difficulties in the work of repairing the Hanoi-Nanning railway. The railway line was once filled with trenches 20 to 30 meters long, and the roadbed had almost disappeared or collapsed. Repairing the roadbed alone required nearly 120,000 cubic meters of soil and more than 440,000 cubic meters of stone. The rails and sleepers had all been removed, and the bridges, stations, and water towers of all sizes had also been destroyed. Now, all of these needed to be rebuilt in the absence of equipment, technical personnel, and experience.

Many cadres were sent to inspect the line. Factories were established along the railway line and in many provinces. The Railway Bureau established twenty study classes to train technical cadres.

Tens of thousands of people enthusiastically signed up to participate in the road construction work. Even in Guang'an Province, which was under the control of the French army, 73 people volunteered to participate in the work. The workers wrote letters to President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnam Workers' Party, and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, guaranteeing to complete the tasks assigned to them. They enthusiastically launched competitions. For example, in the No. 1 Construction Site, the competition resulted in the overfulfillment of 27,643 workdays. In order to manufacture new sleepers, the workers went deep into the jungle to find hardwood, and women also learned to saw wood in order to solve the problem of labor shortage. Initially, an average of only 350 sleepers could be produced per day, but this was later increased to 600. The workers also worked hard to collect lost materials. With the efforts of all the workers and cadres, many tasks, such as repairing the entire roadbed, were finally completed in just over a month.

On December 22, 1954, the Railway Bureau convened a five-day conference to summarize the initial achievements of the Hanoi-Nanning railway repair work, and selected three model units and many labor models. The conference passed a resolution stating that it would quickly complete the construction of the railway in order to make contributions to the construction of the country and the struggle against US imperialism and its followers who are disrupting peace.

    越南人民积极努力修复河内—南关铁路
    【新华社五日讯】据越南通讯社河内三日讯：长达一百五十六公里的河内—南关铁路的路基已经全部修复。目前，铁路南端从安员到北江、北端从南关到同登之间已经完成了铺设枕木和铁轨的工作。铁路线上十八座曾受破坏的桥梁已经修复，五个车站已经建筑起来。制造枕木的工作也超过了预定标准。
    越南人民在修复河内—南关铁路的工作中克服了许多困难。铁路线上曾经布满了二十到三十公尺长的壕沟，路基几乎已经消失或坍陷。仅仅修复路基，就需要近十二万立方公尺的泥土和四十四万多立方公尺的石头。铁轨和枕木都已经全部被搬走，大小桥梁、车站和水塔也都遭到破坏。现在，这些都需要在缺乏器材、缺乏技术人员和经验的情况下重新建设起来。
    许多干部被派去视察线路。铁路沿线和许多省份都建立起了工场。铁路总局设立了二十个学习班来训练技术干部。
    成千上万的人民踊跃报名参加修路工作。甚至在法军控制下的广安省，也有七十三人志愿报名参加工作。工人们写信给胡志明主席、越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府，保证完成交付给他们的任务。他们热烈地展开竞赛。如在第一号建筑工场，经过竞赛就超额完成了二万七千六百四十三个工作日的工作。为了制造新枕木，工人们深入丛林寻找硬木，妇女们也学习着锯木，以解决人力不足的困难。在最初，枕木每天平均只能制造三百五十根，以后提高到能制造六百根了。工人们并且努力收集散失的材料。在全体工人和干部的努力下，在短短的一个多月中终于完成了修复全线路基等许多工作。
    一九五四年十二月二十二日，铁路总局召开了历时五天的大会，总结了河内—南关铁路修复工作的初步成就，并且选出了三个模范单位和许多劳动模范。大会通过决议，表示要迅速完成铁路的修建，以便在建设国家和反对美帝国主义和它的追随者破坏和平的斗争中作出贡献。
