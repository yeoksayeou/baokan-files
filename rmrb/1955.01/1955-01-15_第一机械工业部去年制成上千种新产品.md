Xinhua News Agency, January 14th: Factories affiliated with the First Ministry of Machine Building successfully trial-produced over a thousand new products in 1954. This figure is more than double the number of new products successfully trial-produced in 1953.

The new products successfully trial-produced by the machinery industry primarily supported China's mining and metallurgical industries. The 210 kW winches, rock drills with a striking force of 7 kg, and pneumatic picks and shovels successfully trial-produced in 1954 were supplied to the mining industry, improving mining efficiency and reducing the labor of mining workers. At the end of last year, a prototype electric shovel modeled after the Soviet Э-1003 type was completed. This electric shovel can scoop up one cubic meter of coal, soil, or ore at a time, replacing the heavy labor of many people. After the prototype is evaluated, it will be put into formal production. An ore sintering machine trial-produced for the metallurgical sector has been completed. This sintering machine can agglomerate powdered iron ore into large pieces, which are then sent to blast furnaces for iron smelting. Equipment such as a 100-ton molten iron ladle car, a 16.5 cubic meter slag pot car, an electric mud gun, and a weighing car, successfully trial-produced last year, were supplied to Anshan Iron and Steel Company, increasing the level of automation of the steel capital, Anshan's iron-smelting furnaces. The volume of such heavy machinery equipment successfully trial-produced in 1954 was seven and a half times that of 1953.

In terms of electrical equipment, China's first 6,000 kW steam turbine generator has already been successfully trial-produced. Once the steam turbine and boiler are trial-produced, China will have its first set of domestically produced steam turbine power generation equipment, creating conditions for the further manufacture of more and larger steam turbine power generation equipment. The technical level of manufacturing transformer equipment is improving even faster. China is already able to equip 110 kV substations with domestically produced products. High-voltage surge arresters and high-voltage oil circuit breakers, which could not be manufactured in the past, have been successfully trial-produced. China was previously unable to trial-produce specialized electrical equipment, but last year also saw the successful trial production of equipment such as heat treatment electric furnaces, electric arc steelmaking furnaces, cement reactors, and electrostatic capacitors.

In terms of machine tools, only eight new types of products were made in 1953, compared to thirty-four in 1954. The new types of machine tools successfully trial-produced in 1954 were all larger and better Soviet-style products than before. These include the 262Г horizontal boring machine, the 3160A cylindrical grinder, the 532 gear hobbing machine, and the 1K36 hexagonal lathe.

In 1954, the machinery industry also provided some new types of equipment for agricultural production. Products such as the animal-drawn double-wheel double-furrow plow and the twenty-four-row seeder, successfully trial-produced last year, have been well-received by farmers in many areas who have tried them out. The machinery industry has also directly or indirectly supported light industry and transportation.

    第一机械工业部去年制成上千种新产品
    据新华社十四日讯：第一机械工业部所属各工厂在一九五四年试制成功了一千种以上的新产品。这一数字等于一九五三年试制成功的新产品种数的两倍多。
    机械工业试制成功的新产品，首先支援了我国的采矿、冶金工业。一九五四年试制成功的二百一十瓩的卷扬机、打击力七公斤的凿岩机和风铲、风镐等供应了采矿工业部门，提高了采矿工作效率，也减轻了采矿工人的劳动。去年年底仿照苏联Э——一零零三型电铲试制的样品已经做成。这种电铲一次能铲起一立方公尺的煤、土或矿砂，可代替许多人的笨重劳动。样品经过鉴定后，将正式生产。为冶金部门试制的矿砂烧结机已经制成。这种烧结机可使粉状铁矿结成大块，然后再送到高炉炼铁。去年试制成功的容量一百吨的铁水车、一六点五立方公尺的渣罐车和电动泥炮、称量车等设备，供应了鞍山钢铁公司，使钢都鞍山的炼铁炉的自动化程度提高了。一九五四年试制成功的这类重型机器设备为一九五三年的七倍半。
    在电器设备方面，我国第一台六千瓩的汽轮发电机早已试制成功，等到汽轮机和锅炉试制完成以后，我国就有了第一套自制的汽轮发电设备，并将为进一步制造更多、更大的汽轮发电设备创造条件。制造变电设备的技术水平提高的更快，我国已经能够用自制的产品装备电压十一万伏特的变电所了。过去不能制造的高压避雷器和高压油开关已经试制成功。过去我国无力试制专用电器设备，去年也试制成功了热处理电炉、电弧炼钢炉、水泥电抗器和静电电容器等设备。
    在工作母机方面，一九五三年只做了八种新型产品，一九五四年就做出了三十四种。一九五四年试制成功的新型工作母机都是比以往更大更好的苏联型式的产品。其中有二六二Г型卧式搪床、三一六零A型外圆磨床、五三二型滚齿机、一K三六型六角车床等。
    机械工业一九五四年还对农业生产提供了一些新型设备。去年试制成功的畜力牵引的双轮双铧犁和二十四行播种机等产品，经许多地区农民试用，受到了农民的欢迎。机械工业对于轻工业、交通运输业也直接或间接地进行了支援。
