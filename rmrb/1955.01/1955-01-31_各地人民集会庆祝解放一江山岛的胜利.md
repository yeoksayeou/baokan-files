Xinhua News Agency, January 30th: People across the country have been gathering to celebrate the victory of our army on the Zhejiang front in liberating Yijiangshan Island and are determined to strengthen all work and resolutely struggle for the liberation of Taiwan.

    In a certain wharf in Zhejiang, nearly ten thousand people crowded the streets and the vicinity of the wharf to welcome the partial troops of the People's Liberation Army who returned victoriously after liberating Yijiangshan Island. As the landing craft carrying the victorious heroes approached the shore, deafening cheers immediately erupted on the wharf. The loudspeakers on the wharf continuously broadcast: "Heroes who liberated Yijiangshan Island! We warmly welcome you! The six hundred million people of the motherland are welcoming you! Peace-loving people all over the world are welcoming you!" When the naval fleet that covered the army's liberation of Yijiangshan Island sailed back to a certain harbor, the crowd welcoming them on the wharf took off their hats and waved them at the victorious sailors. Firecrackers, waist drums, and various gongs and drums resounded through the valley, and the band played songs such as "We Must Liberate Taiwan." The sailors sounded their horns to salute the sailors, and fishermen on fishing boats docked in the harbor waved fresh fish in the air. The welcoming crowd squeezed to shake hands and embrace the sailors.
    The crew of the "Jiangxin" ship, the largest and newest passenger and cargo ship on the Yangtze River, which arrived in Hankou for the first time, held a celebration meeting on the afternoon of the Spring Festival to celebrate the victorious return voyage and the liberation of Yijiangshan Island. At the celebration meeting, all crew members unanimously expressed their determination to complete the national transportation tasks well to support the liberation of Taiwan. On the eve of the Spring Festival, the crew members of the "Minzhong" ship, which was sailing between Hankou and Yichang, and the "Dazhong" ship, which was docked in Hankou, also held separate forums to warmly celebrate the liberation of Yijiangshan Island.
    Xu Guangshi, captain of the "Dazhong" ship, and the crew unanimously proposed to sail safely for 40,000 kilometers in the first half of this year to celebrate the liberation of Yijiangshan Island and support the liberation of Taiwan.
    Ruijin County, Jiangxi Province, the site of the Central Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, held a military-civilian celebration party on the 26th with the participation of more than 500 representatives to celebrate the great victory of our army in liberating Yijiangshan Island. Liu Laidi, representative of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Congress and provincial model military dependent, said at the meeting: "We must, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, run our agricultural production cooperatives well, work hard to produce, grow more grain, and wholeheartedly support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan."
