Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Front, 12th: This reporter reports: On the 10th, the temperature on the Zhejiang front dropped to minus five degrees, with a force seven gale blowing. A little after seven in the morning, the first batch of mixed aircraft squadrons of our People's Air Force took off in the strong wind. After the war eagles flew over the harbor of Dachen Island, braving the Kuomintang bandits' dense anti-aircraft fire, they immediately carried out a fierce bombing of the Chiang Kai-shek navy warships anchored in the harbor, immediately damaging one of the Chiang Kai-shek's "Chung" class landing ships. This good news encouraged the Air Force warriors, who confidently stated that they would continue to drop bombs on the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' warships.

A little after eleven o'clock, our second batch of mixed aircraft squadrons took off again. When they entered the airspace near Dachen Island, the anti-aircraft fire from Chiang Kai-shek's warships and the ground of Dachen Island immediately opened fire, forming a barrier fire net in the sky. At this time, the Chiang Kai-shek warships anchored in the harbor had become birds startled by the twang of a bow. Unable to escape to the turbulent outer sea, they panicked and scurried about in the harbor. Our pilots bravely and skillfully passed through the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' anti-aircraft fire and fiercely bombed a Chiang Kai-shek logistics ship. The bombs exploded around the logistics ship, creating huge columns of water. Pilot Liu Jianhan immediately corrected the deviation based on the bombing situation of friendly aircraft, and in the strong wind, immediately carried out a dive bombing on the Chiang Kai-shek logistics ship. The bombs immediately exploded violently on the ship, sending up flames and thick black smoke. At this time, the fighter pilots who were providing cover for their bombing immediately reported excitedly from the radio: "Hit! It's on fire!" The fighter pilots also coordinated with the bomber comrades to carry out a fierce strafing of the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Dachen Island with dense artillery fire. At 1:38 PM, our Air Force mixed aircraft squadrons dispatched for the third time, concentrating and fiercely carrying out a destructive bombing of the Chiang Kai-shek warships. The bomber group commanded by Zhang Weiliang, the air commander of a certain squadron, accurately dropped a large number of heavy bombs on a Chiang Kai-shek "Chung" class landing ship anchored in the harbor of Dachen Island. Just as the bombs exploded on the bow and starboard side of the ship, pilot Song Zongzhou immediately dropped the second batch of bombs, which hit the middle of the ship. This Chiang Kai-shek "Chung" class landing ship, 107 meters long, 17 meters wide, and with a displacement of more than 4,000 tons, was immediately engulfed in raging fire. At the same time, another squadron also hit and set fire to another Chiang Kai-shek warship.

When our Air Force mixed aircraft squadrons were dispatched again at around 3 PM to search for and bomb the remaining Chiang Kai-shek warships, these destroyed and damaged Chiang Kai-shek warships were still burning fiercely. The thick smoke rose to more than 1,000 meters, almost covering the entire airspace of Lower Dachen Island. The pilots passed through the thick smoke rising from the Chiang Kai-shek warships and continued to bomb and strafe the remaining targets.

On this day, the aircraft of our Air Force's various mixed aircraft squadrons safely returned to base after successfully completing their missions. The photos taken by pilot Liu Jianhan during the bombing showed that three of the four bombs he dropped hit the stern of the Chiang Kai-shek warship, and smoke and fire were rising upward. The bombs dropped by Zhang Weiliang directly hit the head and starboard side of a "Chung" class landing ship, and the entire warship was shrouded in a cloud of smoke and fire. The bombs dropped by Song Zongzhou also hit the left side of the middle of the ship. According to reports from the front observation post, this Chiang Kai-shek landing ship was still burning fiercely until the morning of the 11th, and many munitions and supplies on the ship caused continuous explosions.

    人民空军胜利轰炸蒋贼军舰的战斗经过
    【新华社浙江前线十二日电】本社记者报道：十日，浙江前线气温降到零下五度，刮着七级大风。早晨七点多钟，我人民空军第一批混合机队在大风中起飞了。战鹰们飞到大陈岛港湾上空以后，冒着蒋贼军密集的高射炮火，立即对停泊在大陈岛港湾内的蒋贼海军舰艇进行了猛烈的轰炸，当即炸伤了一艘蒋贼中字号登陆舰。这一捷报鼓舞了空军勇士们，他们都满怀信心地表示：要把炸弹继续投到蒋贼的军舰上。
    十一点多钟，我第二批混合机队又起飞了。当它们进入大陈岛附近上空时，蒋贼军舰上和大陈岛地面上的高射炮火立即射击起来，在天空中组成了拦阻火网。这时，停泊在大陈岛港湾内的蒋贼舰艇已经成了惊弓之鸟，它们无法向波浪汹涌的外海逃跑，恐慌地在港湾内乱转乱窜。我军飞行员们勇敢而巧妙地穿过蒋贼的高射炮火，对准蒋贼军的一艘后勤舰猛烈地投弹了。炸弹在这艘后勤舰的周围爆炸起了一个个巨大的水柱。飞行员刘建汉立即根据友机投弹的情况修正了偏差，在大风中紧接着向这艘蒋贼后勤舰进行了俯冲轰炸，炸弹立即在舰上猛烈地爆炸起来，冒起了烈火和浓黑的烟柱。这时，在上空掩护他们轰炸的歼击机飞行员立即从无线电里兴奋地向他们报告说：“炸中了！起火了！”歼击机飞行员又配合轰炸机战友们用密集的炮火向大陈岛蒋贼军进行了猛烈的扫射。下午一点三十八分，我空军混合机队又第三次出动，集中而猛烈地对蒋贼军舰进行了摧毁性的轰炸。某机队的空中指挥员张伟良指挥的轰炸机群，准确地向停泊在大陈岛港湾内的一艘蒋贼中字号登陆舰投下了大批重磅炸弹。炸弹刚在舰头和右舷爆炸开来，飞行员宋宗周紧接着投下的第二批炸弹又炸中了它的中部。这艘长一零七公尺、宽十七公尺、载重量四千多吨的蒋贼中字号登陆舰立即被滚滚的大火吞没了。与此同时另一个机队也把另一艘蒋贼军舰炸中起火了。
    当我空军混合机队在下午三时许又出动搜索和轰炸残余的蒋贼军舰时，这些被炸毁、炸伤的蒋贼军舰还在猛烈的燃烧着，浓烟上升到一千多公尺，几乎掩盖了整个下大陈岛的上空。飞行员们穿过从蒋贼军舰上升起的浓烟，继续对残余目标进行了轰炸和扫射。
    这一天，我空军各批混合机队的飞机在胜利完成任务后都安全地返回了基地。从飞行员刘建汉轰炸时所拍的照片上显示出：他投下的四枚炸弹中有三枚炸中了蒋贼军舰的舰尾，烟和火正在向上冲起。张伟良投下的炸弹，直接命中了一艘中字号登陆舰的头部和右舷，整个军舰被笼罩在一团团的烟火中。宋宗周投下的炸弹也炸中了这艘军舰中部的左舷。另据前方观察哨报告，这艘蒋贼登陆舰，直到十一日上午还在炽烈地燃烧着，舰上的许多弹药和物资引起了持续的爆炸。
