Reader's Letter Column

    To the Editorial Department: Please forward this to the respected People's Liberation Army comrades:
    We are a group of overseas Chinese students who recently returned from abroad, from various parts of Southeast Asia. In the past, we suffered bullying and oppression from imperialist elements. In schools in South Vietnam under French rule, we received the "benevolent" education promoted by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and were not allowed to gather in groups of more than five. There was an incident where a student, in answering a teacher's question in class, said, "I love the motherland of the new China, which has a vast population." The next day, this student was unreasonably expelled. In Thailand, manipulated by American imperialism, the government implemented a brutal anti-Chinese policy, closing all progressive schools and newspapers, even interfering with and monitoring some "study groups." They also colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, forcibly conscripting young people to serve as cannon fodder. In Indonesia, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, supported by its master, American imperialism, dispatched some lackeys to conduct espionage activities and destroy progressive organizations.
    Today, we live on a beautiful and happy land, in the people's capital—Beijing, and by the side of Chairman Mao. How warm we feel! Now, in addition to studying politics and science, we also engage in various sports and recreational activities every day. Respected soldiers, we deeply understand that this happy learning life is what you have earned with your blood and flesh through hundreds of battles. Therefore, we will work harder in our studies and be ready at all times to dedicate our youth to the socialist construction of the motherland.
    Respected soldiers, the new year—the glorious year of 1955—has arrived. Please accept our heartfelt congratulations. We wish you good health, and wish you even greater victories in the struggle for the liberation of Taiwan in the new year!
      The entire body of senior high school students at the Beijing Overseas Chinese补习School

### 归国华侨学生感谢人民解放军

    归国华侨学生感谢人民解放军编辑同志请转敬爱的人民解放军同志们：
    我们是不久以前从国外归来的华侨学生，我们都是来自南洋各地。过去我们是受尽了帝国主义分子的欺凌和压迫的。在法方统治下的南越学校里，我们所受到的是为蒋贼所鼓吹的“善良”教育，不允许五人集会。曾经有这样一件事实，有个同学在上课时回答了老师的问话，他说：“我热爱拥有广大人民的祖国——新中国。”第二天，这个同学就被毫无道理地开除了。在美帝国主义操纵下的泰国政府，施行了残酷的排华政策，把所有进步的学校和报馆，全部封闭，甚至连一些“学习小组”也要受到干涉和监视。他们还勾结了蒋介石卖国集团，强掳青年去充当炮灰。在印度尼西亚，蒋贼集团在它的主子——美国帝国主义的支持下，派遣了一些走狗，进行特务活动，摧残进步团体。
    今天，我们生活在美好幸福的土地上，生活在人民的首都——北京，生活在毛主席的身边，我们是感到多么的温暖啊！现在，我们每天除了学习政治、科学文化以外，还进行各种体育锻炼，文娱活动。敬爱的战士们：我们深深地体会到这种幸福的学习生活是您们经历了千百次战斗，用血肉换来的。因此，我们在学习上要更加努力，时刻准备着把我们的青春贡献给祖国的社会主义建设。
    敬爱的战士们：新的一年——光辉的一九五五年已经到来了，请您们接受我们的衷心祝贺，祝贺您们身体健康；并祝您们在新的一年中在继续为解放台湾的斗争中取得更大的胜利！
      北京归国华侨补习学校高中一全体同学
