Xinhua News Agency, January 7th: TASS, January 6th: The Indonesian government announced on January 5th that several islands belonging to the South Moluccas region are in a state of emergency. These islands are the center of a separatist movement instigated by American and Dutch imperialists. The purpose of this movement is to separate the South Moluccas Islands from Indonesia and establish an "independent" state there.

Xinhua News Agency, January 7th, Jakarta News: Recently revealed facts prove that the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands are interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs, supporting armed rebel bandits with weapons and money to carry out subversive activities.

According to Western news agencies, Rong Schlage, the head of the Dutch intelligence organization in Indonesia and an active organizer of subversive activities, will soon be tried in Jakarta. The testimonies of witnesses against Rong Schlage's crimes reveal the relationship between the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, and armed rebel bandits. These witnesses said that planes from the US and British embassies in Jakarta, Dutch planes, and planes from the New Jersey-New York Mobil Oil Company of the United States continuously airdropped weapons and supplies to rebels in various regions.

Manrohe, a witness who used to work in the subversive organization led by Rong Schlage, said that in 1952 and 1953, he participated twelve times in airdropping weapons and food to bandits in Java and Sumatra. On two of these occasions, he was on a C-47 aircraft from the US Embassy.

Manrohe and another witness also said that they regularly went to the US and British embassies in Jakarta to collect money.

Manrohe said that at the beginning of 1953, he went to the US Information Service in Jakarta to deliver a warning to the former US Ambassador to Jakarta, Cochran, telling him that the Indonesian government was aware of Cochran's illegal activities in supporting the rebels. Manrohe said that two weeks after he delivered the warning, Cochran was transferred.

The Indonesian "People's Daily" published an editorial pointing out that the witnesses' testimonies and documentary evidence prove that the imperialists harbor huge conspiracies against the Republic. The newspaper called on the government to take necessary measures to safeguard the security of the Republic.

    印度尼西亚政府宣布
    南摩鹿加区域的若干岛屿处于紧急状态
    美、英、荷三国支持武装匪徒对印度尼西亚进行颠覆活动
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社六日讯：印度尼西亚政府一月五日宣布，属于南摩鹿加区域的若干岛屿已处于紧急状态。这些岛屿是美、荷帝国主义者煽动的分裂运动的中心。这个运动的目的是使南摩鹿加群岛脱离印度尼西亚，并在那里建立一个“独立”国。
    【新华社七日讯】雅加达消息：最近揭露出来的事实证明：美国、英国和荷兰干涉印度尼西亚内政、以武器和金钱支持武装叛乱匪徒进行颠覆活动。
    据西方通讯社报道，颠覆活动的积极组织者、荷兰在印度尼西亚的特务组织的头子荣斯拉格最近将在雅加达受审判。证人们对荣斯拉格的罪行提出的证词，揭露了美国、英国、荷兰和武装叛乱匪徒之间的关系。这些证人说，美国和英国驻雅加达大使馆的飞机、荷兰飞机和美国新泽西—纽约美孚油公司的飞机不断地空投武器和物资给各个地区的叛乱分子。
    曾在荣斯拉格领导下的颠覆组织中工作过的证人曼罗赫说，在一九五二年和一九五三年，他曾十二次参加把武器和粮食空投给爪哇和苏门答腊的匪徒们。其中有两次是乘坐美国大使馆的C—47式飞机。
    曼罗赫和另外一个证人还说，他们曾定期到美国和英国驻雅加达大使馆去拿钱。
    曼罗赫说，在一九五三年年初，他曾经到雅加达美国新闻处去给前美国驻雅加达大使柯克兰传递一个警告，告诉他说，印度尼西亚政府已经知道柯克兰支持叛乱分子的非法活动了。曼罗赫说，在他传递警告后的两个星期以后，柯克兰就被调走了。
    印度尼西亚“人民日报”发表社论指出，证人的这些证词和文件证据证明，帝国主义者对共和国怀着巨大的阴谋。报纸要求政府采取必要的措施来保障共和国的安全。
