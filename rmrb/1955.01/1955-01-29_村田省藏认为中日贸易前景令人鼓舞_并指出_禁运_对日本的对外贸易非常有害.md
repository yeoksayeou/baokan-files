Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 28th: Hong Kong newspaper reports: Murata Shozo, President of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, told reporters in Hong Kong on the 26th on his way back to Japan from China, that the prospect of promoting trade between Japan and China is very encouraging.

In answering reporters' questions, he said that China sincerely wishes to improve relations with Japan, including trade relations. He believes that the current situation is beneficial to expanding trade between Japan and China, because both sides are willing to conduct more trade.

He said: "The embargo" has proven to be very harmful to Japan's foreign trade. He pointed out that the current volume of trade between Japan and China is still very limited, which is the result of "the embargo." He predicted that once "the embargo" is lifted, trade between Japan and China can be greatly increased.

    村田省藏认为中日贸易前景令人鼓舞
    并指出“禁运”对日本的对外贸易非常有害
    【新华社广州二十八日电】香港报纸消息：日本国际贸易促进协会会长村田省藏在从中国回日本途中，二十六日在香港对新闻记者发表谈话说：促进日中两国贸易的前景是非常令人鼓舞的。
    他回答记者的问题说：中国真诚地愿意改善和日本的关系，包括贸易关系。他认为，目前的形势对于扩大日中两国间的贸易是有利的，因为双方都愿意进行更多的贸易。
    他说：“禁运”已经证明是对日本的对外贸易非常有害的。他指出：日本和中国间的贸易额目前所以还很有限，就是“禁运”的结果。他预料一旦取消了“禁运”，日本和中国的贸易可以大大增加。
