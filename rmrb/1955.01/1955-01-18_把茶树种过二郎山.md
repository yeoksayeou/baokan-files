    Planting Tea Trees Beyond Erlang Mountain

    The *Xikang Daily* published news on November 12th of last year announcing the successful trial planting of tea trees in the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region. Simultaneously, it published a communication titled “Planting Tea Trees Beyond Erlang Mountain” and historical data related to "border tea." These reports collectively reflect the care and concern of the Party and the government for the Tibetan compatriots, as well as the new changes in the Kangzang Plateau, where Tibetan compatriots have started planting tea trees with the help of the Han people.

    The successful trial planting of tea trees on the Kangzang Plateau is of great significance. The *Xikang Daily* pointed out in its report that tea is a necessity for the Tibetan people. They need tea just as they need butter and tsampa; they cannot live without it every day. However, before liberation, under the long-term oppression of successive ruling classes, the people of the Kangzang Plateau could not obtain their most needed tea locally. The data and communications made vivid comparisons on this point. The data stated that rulers of the Song, Ming, and Qing dynasties, as well as the Kuomintang reactionary government, all used tea as a tool to rule and control the Tibetan people. They enacted "tea laws," increased tea taxes, forbade the Tibetan people from planting tea, and even used "decapitation" to prohibit the trafficking of tea, and they forbade tea seeds from entering the region. Some Tibetan compatriots suffered the misfortune of family ruin and separation because of planting tea. Since liberation, this painful era for the Tibetan compatriots has ended forever. Since 1951, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Xikang Provincial People's Government has sent technicians and tea planting workers, carrying large quantities of tea seeds, to various counties in the Tibetan Autonomous Region for trial planting and promotion. Over the years, a total of seven or eight thousand catties of tea seeds have been sown in thirteen counties of the Tibetan Autonomous Region, and hundreds of thousands of seedlings have been cultivated. Among them, the tea seedlings cultivated in Danba County in 1952 have survived two cold winters and grown to over a foot tall. At the same time, under the cultivation of the Party and the People's Government, Tibetan people's own technical talents in tea planting are also growing.

    The communication "Planting Tea Trees Beyond Erlang Mountain" is a story about a Han tea planting worker, Zhao Yongfu, who tried planting tea trees on the plateau. It embodies the sincere help of the Han people to the Tibetan people. In the spring of 1951, Zhao Yongfu responded to the call of the People's Government and left his hometown of Ya'an County to plant tea in Luding County, a Tibetan Autonomous Region, beyond Erlang Mountain. Zhao Yongfu visited many local farmers, studied the characteristics of the plateau climate and soil, and explored a set of experiences for planting tea on the plateau. Under the leadership of the government and with the help of the Provincial Tea Farm, since 1953, he has worked hard and promoted and transplanted a total of 150,000 to 160,000 tea seedlings, with an average survival rate of seven or eight out of ten. Zhao Yongfu said: After the tea production in Luding develops in the future, it will be able to supply the Tibetan people with more and cheaper tea, helping the Tibetan people to better improve their lives. At the same time, the development of "border tea" here will free up more Sichuan tea to enrich exports and exchange it for steel and machinery from foreign countries, which can be used to equip factories and farms and build socialism. What a noble purpose, what a noble aspiration!

    Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and with the kind help of the Han people, the people of various ethnic minorities are continuing to improve their material and cultural lives and move towards a happier path. Local newspapers, especially newspapers in ethnic minority areas, should pay attention to publicizing the lives and changes of ethnic minorities, as well as the victory of the Party's policy of ethnic unity, to the people of all ethnic groups through vivid typical examples in a more in-depth manner.

### 把茶树种过二郎山

    把茶树种过二郎山
    西康日报去年十一月十二日发表了西康省藏族自治区试种茶树成功的消息，同时还发表了题为“把茶树种过二郎山去”的通讯和一篇有关“边茶”的历史资料。通过这些报道集中地反映了党和政府对藏族同胞的关怀，以及藏族同胞在汉族人民的帮助下开始在康藏高原上种植茶树的新变化。
    在康藏高原上试种茶树成功，有着重大的意义。西康日报在报道中指明，茶叶是藏族人民的生活必需品，他们需要茶叶，就同需要酥油、?粑一样，每天都离不开它。但是，康藏高原上的人民，在解放前历代统治阶级的长期摧残下，是不能就地得到他们最需要的茶叶的。在资料和通讯中，就对此作了比较生动的对比。资料中说：宋代、明代、清代的统治者以至国民党反动政府，都把茶叶作为统治和控制藏族人民的工具。他们订“茶法”，增茶税，禁止藏族人民种茶，甚至用“杀头”来禁止贩运茶叶，更不许茶籽入境。有些藏族同胞因为种茶而招致了家败人离的惨祸。自从解放以后，藏族同胞的这种痛苦时代就一去不复返了。从一九五一年起，西康省人民政府农林厅就派了技术人员和种茶工人，带着大批茶籽，到藏族自治区各县试种和推广。几年来在藏族自治区的十三个县里，一共播种了七、八千斤茶籽，育苗达数十万株。其中丹巴县一九五二年培育的茶苗，已经渡过了两个寒冬，长到一尺多高了。同时，在党和人民政府的培养下，藏族人民自己植茶的技术人材也正在成长。
    “把茶树种过二郎山去”的通讯，是写的一个汉族种茶工人赵永福在高原上试种茶树的故事。它体现了汉族人民对于藏族人民的热诚帮助。一九五一年春天，赵永福响应人民政府的号召，离开了他的家乡雅安县，到二郎山那边——藏族自治区泸定县去种茶。赵永福访问了当地的许多农民，研究了高原气候和土壤的特点，摸索出一套在高原上种茶的经验。他在政府的领导和省茶场的帮助下，一九五三年以来，进行了艰苦工作，一共推广、移植了十五、六万株茶苗，平均每十株就活了七、八株。赵永福说：以后泸定的茶叶生产发展了，就可以供给藏族人民更多更便宜的茶叶，帮助藏族人民更好地改善生活。同时我们这里的“边茶”发展了，便腾出了更多的川茶去充实外销，向国外换回钢材和机器，用来装备工厂、农庄，建设社会主义。这是多么高尚的目的，多么高尚的愿望啊！
    各地少数民族人民在共产党和人民政府领导下，在汉族人民的亲切帮助下，正继续改善自己的物质和文化生活，朝着更幸福的道路前进。各地报纸特别是各少数民族地区的报纸，应该注意通过生动的典型事例，更深入地向各族人民宣传少数民族的生活及其变化，宣传党的民族团结政策的胜利。　（李钟）
