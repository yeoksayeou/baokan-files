Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 14th (TASS): A report by “Pravda” correspondents Orestov and Skalkin in Delhi points out that American war propaganda has suffered a defeat in India. The millions of dollars spent by the United States on propaganda in India have not achieved their purpose.

	The Pravda correspondents said: Indian newspapers point out that American propaganda has been forced to retreat. The budget of the United States Information Service in India has been cut by nearly 90 percent, more than half of its employees have been laid off, the circulation of American publications in India has been reduced, and the "American Report" published in many Indian national languages has been discontinued.

	The reporters continued, the danger of American propaganda to Indian national interests is becoming increasingly apparent. The recent ban by the Indian government on the distribution of any American printed matter among Indian army officers and soldiers proves this point.

	American propaganda has entered a dead end because what it tries to instill in the people of India and other Asian countries is far from being in line with their national aspirations, but directly contradicts them.

	It is clear from the report of the Indian News Association that most Indian newspapers refuse to publish "certain materials," including articles against the Soviet Union, against China, and in support of American foreign policy.

	The Pravda correspondents continued, American diplomats and propagandists are alarmed by the growing cultural and economic relations between the Soviet Union and India. The Soviet proposal to build a factory in India with an annual output of one million tons of steel has recently aroused great interest. Indian newspapers have welcomed this Soviet proposal, which promotes India's industrialization and is an example of friendly assistance.

	However, the Soviet proposal has caused panic among British and American figures. The United States is using all its propaganda channels in India to slander the Soviet proposal. “Business Week,” in talking about these attempts, wrote that elements trying to undermine government policies have shamelessly united.

	The reporters added that American propagandists have been constantly slandering the People's Republic of China and doing their best to undermine the friendly relations between India and China. This has made Indian public opinion, which has a sincere and deep affection for People's China, very angry.

	The reporters concluded that all these facts show that the efforts of American propagandists to deceive the Indian people have failed. American war propaganda and propaganda inciting international hostility and hatred have achieved nothing in India.

    美国的战争宣传在印度遭到了失败
    ——“真理报”驻德里记者奥列斯托夫和斯卡尔金的报道
   【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十四日讯：“真理报”驻德里记者奥列斯托夫和斯卡尔金的报道指出，美国战争宣传在印度遭到了失败。美国为了在印度进行宣传所花费的数以百万计的美元并没有达到目的。
    真理报记者说：印度报纸指出，美国的宣传已经被迫退却。在印度的美国新闻处经费已经削减将近百分之九十，一半以上的雇员已被解雇，美国刊物在印度的发行数已经削减，以印度许多民族文字出版的“美国报道”也已经停刊。
    记者接着说，美国宣传对印度国家利益的危险性日益明显。最近印度政府禁止在印度陆军官兵中散发任何美国印刷品，这个事实就可以证明这点。
    美国的宣传进入一条死胡同，因为它设法向印度和其他亚洲人民灌输的东西远不符合于他们的民族愿望，而是直接同这种愿望相抵触的。
    从印度新闻协会的报告中可以清楚看出，大部分印度报纸拒绝刊登“某种材料”，这种材料包括反对苏联、反对中国的文章和支持美国外交政策的材料。
    真理报记者接着说，美国外交人员和宣传家对于苏联同印度之间日益增长的文化和经济关系感到惊慌。苏联关于为印度建造一个年产一百万吨钢的工厂的建议最近引起了人们极大的兴趣。印度报纸对于这个促进印度的工业化，并且是友好援助的范例的苏联建议表示欢迎。
    但是，苏联的建议在英、美人士中间引起了恐慌。美国利用它在印度的所有的宣传途径来诽谤苏联的建议。“工商业周刊”在谈到这些企图时写道，设法破坏政府政策的分子无耻地联合起来了。
    记者又说，美国宣传家们一直不断地对中华人民共和国进行诽谤，并且尽他们的最大努力来破坏印度和中国之间的友好关系。这使得对人民中国有着真挚和深厚感情的印度舆论非常愤怒。
    记者最后说，所有这一切事实表明，美国宣传家企图欺骗印度人民的努力失败了。美国的战争宣传和煽动国际间敌意和仇恨的宣传在印度一无所成。
