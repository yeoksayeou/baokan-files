Guangdong Province's agricultural technology extension stations have expanded from over fifty to more than one hundred and seventy.

Most stations, based on agricultural production cooperatives, extensively organize technology research groups and run technical training classes to impart various advanced agricultural techniques. From early October to early December of last year, according to preliminary statistics from fifty-one counties, over 31,000 farmer technicians have been trained. Many production cooperative cadres, mutual aid team leaders, model workers, and production experts have already learned basic science and technology, and they have applied methods such as wheat strip seeding, sweet potato close planting, and rational fertilization to winter farming production. The 3,915 farmer technicians trained in eight counties, including Meixian, Chaoyang, and Longchuan, have become the backbone of promoting technological innovation. In Zhongshan County, after thirty-four farmers learned pig-curing techniques, they bought more than twenty syringes and cured two hundred sick pigs in just over ten days.

    广东训练一批农民技术员
    广东省农业技术推广站，已从五十多个扩大到一百七十多个。
    各站大多以农业生产合作社为基点，广泛组织技术研究小组和开办技术训练班，传授各种农业先进技术。从去年十月初到十二月上旬，据五十一个县的初步统计，经过训练的农民技术员达三万一千多人。许多生产合作社的干部、互助组长、劳动模范和生产能手，都已经学会了基本的科学技术，他们已将小麦条播、蕃薯密植、合理施肥等方法运用到冬耕生产中。梅县、潮阳、龙川等八县训练的三千九百一十五名农民技术员，已成为当前推动技术改革的骨干。中山县有三十四个农民学会了医猪技术后，就买了二十多枝注射针，在十多天内医好了两百头病猪。　　（李少球）
