    Vietnam's "Restore Production This Winter and Next Spring" Movement

    The Economic Committee and the Ministry of Agriculture of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam launched a "Restore Production This Winter and Next Spring" competition movement starting in early November of last year. The purpose of this movement is to reduce the area of wasteland, increase yields, expand the planting area of summer crops and auxiliary crops, and prepare for coping with the lean season.

    Farmers responded to the call and enthusiastically engaged in a competition to reclaim wasteland and prepared well for planting summer crops and auxiliary crops. As of December 1954, many regions have achieved good results.

    越南“在今冬明春恢复生产”运动
    越南民主共和国政府经济委员会和农业部从去年十一月初发起了一个“在今冬明春恢复生产”的竞赛运动。这个运动的目的是减少荒地面积，提高产量，扩大夏季作物和辅助作物的种植面积，准备应付青黄不接时期。
    农民们响应了号召，热情地进行了开垦荒地的竞赛，并且为种植夏季作物和辅助作物作好准备。截至一九五四年十二月为止，许多地区已经取得了良好的成绩。
