Response to Criticism and Suggestions

    Yizheng County, Jiangsu Province, writes: The article "Yizheng County Should Examine the Error of Delaying the Farming Season" published on the "Letters to the Editor" page on November 28th was entirely correct. The reasons for this error were mainly due to a lack of research and assessment of the water situation and local soil conditions. At the time, some grassroots cadres had pointed out that late rice was not suitable for planting locally, but the leadership did not accept this opinion. Secondly, we lacked a comprehensive planting plan in our work and blindly believed that mountain seeds could be resolved by the masses themselves. Therefore, out of the 100,000 jin of mung beans in storage, only 60,000 jin were allocated to the polder area for replanting, neglecting the seed shortage in the mountainous areas. Later, due to continuous heavy rain, the mountainous areas replanted several times. When seeds were in short supply and seeds were transferred from other counties, the farming season had already been delayed. This shows that our work was not thorough. We will definitely accept this lesson and pay attention to overcoming the bureaucratic work style in future work.

专栏：批评建议的反应

    仪征县检讨延误农时的错误
    江苏省仪征县人民政府来信：去年十一月二十八日“来信专页”刊登了“仪征县应该检查延误农时的错误”一稿，是完全正确的。产生这一错误的原因，主要是对水势和当地土质等缺乏研究和估计。当时有些基层干部曾反映晚稻不适宜当地种植，但领导上没有接受这个意见。其次，我们在工作中缺乏全面的播种计划，盲目地认为山区种籽可以由群众自己调剂解决。所以，库存绿豆十万斤，只拨了六万斤给圩区补种，忽视了山区缺种的情况。后来由于连降大雨，山区改种数次，种籽缺乏，再从外县调运种籽时，已经延误了农时。这说明我们的工作是不深入的，我们一定接受这一教训，在今后的工作中注意克服官僚主义的作风。
