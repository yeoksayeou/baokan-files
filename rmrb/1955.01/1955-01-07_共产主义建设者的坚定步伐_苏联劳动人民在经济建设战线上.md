	Firm Strides of Communist Builders
	—Soviet Laboring People on the Economic Construction Front
	More Than 700 Hydropower Stations Under Construction
	The Soviet Union's 1954 electricity production plan was completed ahead of schedule at the end of 1954. Compared with the pre-Great Patriotic War period, the power output of Soviet power stations has increased threefold. In the first four years of the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1951-1955), several huge power stations, such as the Shirokaya Gora Hydropower Station, the Tsimlyansk Hydropower Station, the Mingachevir and Dubossary Hydropower Stations, have been put into production.
	Currently, all generators in Soviet hydropower stations are fully automated. More than half of the hydropower plants are remotely controlled. In all thermal power plants across the country, more than one-third have installed high-voltage equipment, with combustion, water addition, and other technical processes regulated and controlled by automatic instruments. Due to the improvement of these processes, 500,000 tons of fuel were saved in the first eleven months of last year.
	At present, more than 700 hydropower stations and rural hydropower stations are under construction throughout the Soviet Union. The construction of the world's largest hydropower stations, the Kuibyshev and Stalingrad hydropower stations, are in full swing. In Siberia, hydropower stations are being built in Irkutsk on the Angara River and Novosibirsk on the Ob River.
	Expanding Oil Bases in the Eastern Regions
	On the eve of the 1955 New Year, Soviet oil workers presented their motherland with a beautiful New Year's gift – completing the 1954 oil refining and gas production plans ahead of schedule. In 1954, various petroleum products increased significantly, and millions of tons of gasoline, kerosene, diesel, and other petroleum products supplied the needs of the growing industry, transportation, and agriculture. While increasing production, oil workers also strived to adopt new working methods to reduce production costs. In the first eleven months of 1954 alone, they saved the state 170 million rubles in cost.
	The Soviet Union is expanding oil production areas in Bashkir, Tatar, the Volga River basin, and other eastern regions. The second oil production center has been developed between the Urals and the Volga River, where oil production accounts for more than half of the current total Soviet oil production.
	In celebrating the 1955 New Year, Soviet oil workers have launched a socialist competition to complete the 1955 oil production plan ahead of schedule and further develop the Soviet oil industry.
	Build 300 More Large-Scale Farms This Year
	In 1954, Soviet state farms achieved great development in agriculture and animal husbandry.
	Last year, the sown area of crops on Soviet state farms expanded by more than 1.5 million hectares (1 hectare equals 15 Chinese mu). Despite very unfavorable climatic conditions, most state farms achieved a good harvest of crops. Compared with 1953, state farms delivered 28 million poods (1 pood equals 32.176 Chinese jin) more grain to the state in 1954, and 1.5 times more potatoes and vegetables.
	In terms of animal husbandry, the number of dairy cows in state farms across the country increased by nearly 12% last year, and the number of pigs and sheep increased even more. Many state farms produced an average of 5,000 to 6,000 kilograms of milk per dairy cow throughout the year. State farms also delivered more milk and meat to the state than in 1953.
	Last spring, 124 new state-owned grain farms were established in the reclamation areas of Kazakhstan, Siberia, the Volga River basin, and the Urals. In the past year, they reclaimed a total of nearly 5.5 million hectares of wasteland, which enabled state farms to greatly expand the sown area of grain last year. This year, 280 to 300 large-scale state farms will be established in various reclamation areas to prepare for the continued reclamation of millions of hectares of wasteland, and 6.8 million hectares of grain will be sown on the newly reclaimed land. Currently, 12,000 tractor drivers, combine operators, and experienced leading cadres who volunteered to participate in wasteland reclamation have arrived in the reclamation areas and begun the construction of new farms. Various powerful agricultural machines for wasteland reclamation on these new farms have also been shipped successively.
	Progress of the "Moscow Ten-Year Overall Reconstruction Plan"
	In 1954, Moscow's construction personnel and municipal workers made great achievements in implementing the decision of the "Moscow Ten-Year Overall Reconstruction Plan."
	In terms of the construction of residential and cultural welfare institutions, Moscow has built new housing with a construction area of 910,000 square meters in 1954, which is 10,000 square meters more than the original plan. In addition, 32 schools with a total capacity of nearly 27,500 students, 10 hospitals with more than 1,400 beds, and more than 60 nurseries and kindergartens with a total capacity of approximately 5,200 children have been built. A large hotel with 28 floors has been completed and has begun operations. The 385 new shops, public canteens, and kiosks that have been newly opened have also begun to serve residents. In addition, the Moscow City Soviet allocated 412 million rubles to repair more than 3,900 buildings and improve residential facilities.
	Moscow's transportation industry has been further developed. In 1954, Moscow newly built and reconstructed more than 1 million square meters of roads. The entire 20-kilometer-long underground tram loop line has been opened to traffic, and three new underground stations have been completed. In addition, the first above-ground station of the underground tram line has appeared.
	Moscow municipal workers have done a lot of work in beautifying and greening the urban area. Moscow already has many street gardens and trees, but last year new street gardens were built on Kiev Station and Uprising Square, and 235,000 trees and more than 1.8 million saplings were planted in parks and boulevards. A memorial statue of the great Russian composer Tchaikovsky has been erected in the city.
	Strive for the Widespread Use of Atomic Engines
	The "Red Star Newspaper" recently published an article by Wei Kuznestov, Doctor of Technical Sciences, entitled "Technical Progress in the Soviet Union."
	The article said: In the near future, with the emergence of atomic engines and atomic power stations, technological development will have a new qualitative leap. The world's first atomic power plant built by the Soviet Union has supplied electricity to nearby industry and agriculture. Currently, Soviet scientists and engineers are studying the establishment of nuclear power industrial power stations with a power generation capacity of 50,000 to 100,000 kilowatts. It is interesting to point out that a 100,000-kilowatt nuclear power station only consumes 400 grams of uranium per day. Soviet scientists and engineers are currently working to make the day when industry, railway and automobile transportation, airplanes and ships use atomic engines come sooner. (Xinhua News Agency)

    共产主义建设者的坚定步伐
    ——苏联劳动人民在经济建设战线上
    七百多个水电站在兴建中
    苏联一九五四年的电力生产计划已经在一九五四年年底提前完成。和卫国战争以前相比，苏联电站部电力站的电力产量已经增加到三倍。在第五个五年计划（一九五一—一九五五年）的头四年中，已经有好几个巨大的电力站，如石山口水电站、齐姆良水电站、明格查乌尔和杜波萨里水电站等投入生产。
    目前，苏联各水电站的所有发电机已经完全自动化。有一半以上的水力发电厂实行了远距离操纵。在全国所有的火力发电厂中，已经有三分之一安装了高压设备，由自动仪器调节和控制着燃烧、加水量和其他技术过程。由于改进了这些过程，在去年头十一个月中，节省了五十万吨燃料。
    现在，苏联全国正在兴建七百多个水电站和农村水电站。世界上最大的水电站古比雪夫和斯大林格勒水电站的建设工程正在热火朝天地进行。在西伯利亚，安加拉河上的伊尔库次克和鄂毕河上的新西伯利亚城都在兴建水电站。
  扩大东部地区的石油基地
    一九五五年新年的前夕，苏联石油工人献给他们祖国一件美好的新年礼物——提前完成了一九五四年的石油提炼计划和瓦斯生产计划。在一九五四年中，各种石油产品得到了显著的增加，千百万吨的汽油、煤油、柴油和其他石油产品供应了日益发展的工业、运输业和农业的需要。在增加产量的同时，石油工人还努力采用新的工作方法，减低生产成本。单在一九五四年头十一个月中，他们就为国家节约了一亿七千万卢布的成本费。
    苏联正在巴什基尔、鞑靼、伏尔加河流域和东部其他地区扩大石油产地。在乌拉尔和伏尔加河之间已经发展了第二个石油生产中心，那里的石油产量占目前全苏联石油产量的一半以上。
    在欢庆一九五五年新年的日子里，苏联石油工人已经展开了提前完成一九五五年石油生产计划和进一步发展苏联石油工业的社会主义竞赛。
  今年再建三百个大型农场
    一九五四年，苏联国营农场的农业和畜牧业获得了很大的发展。
    苏联国营农场去年农作物的播种面积扩大了一百五十多万公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）。尽管气候条件很不好，但是大多数的国营农场的农作物都获得了丰收。和一九五三年比较，一九五四年国营农场缴纳给国家的谷物增加了二千八百万普特（每普特合三十二点一七六市斤），马铃薯和蔬菜增加为一倍半。
    在畜牧业方面，一九五四年各地国营农场的奶牛将近增加了百分之十二，猪和羊增加得更多。许多国营农场去年全年平均每头奶牛出奶五千到六千公斤。国营农场向国家缴纳的牛奶和肉也比一九五三年增多了。
    去年春季，在哈萨克、西伯利亚、伏尔加河流域和乌拉尔等开垦地区建立了一百二十四个新的国营谷物农场。它们在去年一年内总共开垦了将近五百五十万公顷的荒地，这就使国营农场有可能在去年大大扩大谷物的播种面积。今年，各开垦地区还要建立二百八十到三百个大型国营农场，准备继续开垦几百万公顷荒地，并且在新垦地上播种六百八十万公顷谷物。现在，已经有一万二千个志愿参加开荒工作的拖拉机手、联合机手和有经验的领导干部到了开垦区，开始进行新农场的建设工作。这些新农场开垦荒地用的各种效力强大的农业机器也陆续运到了。
  “莫斯科十年总改建计划”的进展
    莫斯科市的建筑人员和市政工作人员，一九五四年在执行“莫斯科十年总改建计划”的决定中取得了巨大的成就。
    在住宅和文化福利机关的建设方面，一九五四年莫斯科已经建造了建筑面积达九十一万平方公尺的新住宅，比原定计划多一万平方公尺。另外还修建了总共可以容纳将近两万七千五百个学生的三十二所学校、拥有一千四百多个床位的十所医院，以及共能容纳约五千二百个儿童的六十多个托儿所和幼儿园。一座有二十八层楼的大旅馆已经落成并且开始营业。新开设的三百八十五个商店、公共食堂和售货亭也已经开始为居民服务。此外，莫斯科市苏维埃还拨出了四亿一千二百万卢布来修缮三千九百多幢建筑物和改进住宅设备。
    莫斯科市的交通事业已经获得进一步发展。一九五四年，莫斯科新修和重修了一百多万平方公尺的道路。长达二十公里的地下电车道大环行线已经全部通车，三座新的地下车站已经落成。此外还出现了地下电车道的第一个地上车站。
    莫斯科市政工作人员在美化和绿化市区方面作了不少工作。莫斯科的街心花园和树木本来已经很多，但去年又在基辅车站和起义广场上辟建了新的街心花园，在公园中和林荫道上栽种了二十三万五千株树木和一百八十多万株树苗。伟大的俄罗斯作曲家柴可夫斯基的纪念像已经在市区中耸立起来。
  为广泛使用原子发动机而斗争
    “红星报”最近登载了技术科学博士维·库兹涅佐夫的题为“苏联的技术进展”的文章。
    文章中说：在不久的将来，随着原子发动机和原子电力站的出现，技术发展将有新的飞跃的质变。苏联建立的世界上第一个原子发电厂已经把电力供应附近的工业和农业。现在，苏联科学家和工程师正在研究建立发电能力从五万到十万瓩的原子能工业电力站。指出这样一件事情是很有趣的：一个十万瓩的核子电力站每天只耗费四百公分铀。苏联科学家和工程师目前正在努力使工业、铁路和汽车运输业、飞机和轮船使用原子发动机的一天更快来临。　（据新华社讯）
