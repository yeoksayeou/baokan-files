    The reply given by Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Comrade Malenkov, to questions raised by Mr. Shott, Washington Bureau Chief of the United Press, on New Year's Day of this year, offered a brilliant analysis of the current international situation. He pointed out that, due to the errors of Western countries, the threat to peace is increasing and the danger of war is growing. Comrade Malenkov also pointed out the correct path to safeguarding peace and international security. This reply by Comrade Malenkov has already caused a tremendous reaction in public opinion in various countries, winning the enthusiastic support of peace-loving people in all countries and inspiring their confidence in the struggle for peace. Fair-minded world opinion considers this an important expression of the Soviet government and people's commitment to consolidating the cause of peace. Only the American aggressive bloc and its followers were panicked by the Soviet leader's reply, exposing their true face of not wanting peace.
    Comrade Malenkov said that to maintain peace between the Soviet Union and the United States requires both sides to sincerely desire peace and work for it; it requires both sides to consider the possibility and necessity of peaceful coexistence, as well as their legitimate common interests; the Soviet Union "is willing to continue to exert all its strength to ensure lasting and solid peaceful relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, to resolve existing differences, as long as the United States of America also expresses the same willingness." Obviously, the Soviet Union is willing to coexist peacefully with the United States, improve US-Soviet relations, and ease international tensions. In fact, for several years, the Soviet Union has made continuous efforts in these areas, both in the East and the West, and has achieved some results, which have eased the world situation to some extent. The current tension between the Soviet Union and the United States is entirely not the responsibility of the Soviet Union.
    So, what are the reasons for the tension between the United States and the Soviet Union? Comrade Malenkov said: "The main reason for the tension in the relations between the Soviet Union and the United States is that some Americans are pursuing a policy of rebuilding the revanchist West German army, engaging in an arms race, and establishing a network of American military bases around the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries, a policy which can only be regarded as preparing for a new war." We completely agree with Comrade Malenkov's statement. In fact, the American policy of preparing for a new war has not only created tension between the United States and the Soviet Union, but is also the root cause of the current deterioration of the international situation. As everyone knows, the American aggressive bloc and its British and French followers, disregarding the opposition of the Soviet Union and peace-loving people in all countries, concluded the Paris Agreements and exerted pressure to make the French National Assembly approve them against the will of the French people. The obvious aim of the American aggressive bloc is to make unilateral decisions on the German question, which should be handled jointly by the Soviet Union, Britain, France, and the United States, behind the back of the Soviet Union, making the peaceful reunification of Germany impossible, reviving West German militarism, and expanding the European aggressive system to threaten European peace and security. In the Far East, the American aggressive bloc is also stepping up its preparations for war and creating divisions. The recent trip to the Far East by Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford was to redeploy the US military's aggressive forces, accelerate the rearmament of Japan, expand military aggression against our country, and piece together the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, Japan, and the Syngman Rhee clique into a Northeast Asian aggressive alliance. At the same time, the US State Department announced that it would convene a meeting of the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc in Bangkok on February 23. The purpose of this meeting is to attempt to put together so-called mobile forces to carry out war provocations in Southeast Asia; to strengthen and expand interference in the Asian people's struggle for peace and national independence; and to attempt to undermine the Geneva Conference agreements and disrupt peace in Southeast Asia. US President Eisenhower's "State of the Union Address" delivered on the 6th, used some words of peace on the surface, but the essence of preparing for war could not be concealed. The address itself admits that the US military budget accounts for two-thirds of the entire US budget. It particularly emphasized the US activities in organizing aggressive blocs around the world and expanding and strengthening the division of the world. The American aggressive bloc also plans to link the Far East aggressive system with the Western European aggressive system through the Middle East aggressive organization it is actively planning, forming a large encirclement around the Soviet Union and all peace-loving countries; all this is for the purpose of enslaving the local people and preparing for a new war.
    It should be pointed out that in the American plan to prepare for a new war, atomic weapons have been regarded as an important means of carrying out aggressive adventures. Recently, not only did the commander of the US 49th Air Division stationed in the UK, Stevenson, openly announce that the US has made the UK a base for atomic bombing of the Soviet Union; but Washington is also preparing to equip the future West German army with atomic weapons. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting held in Paris in the middle of last month, under US pressure, approved a "report" preparing for an atomic war, intending to make atomic weapons the conventional armaments of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. Eisenhower's "State of the Union Address" openly stated: "We must continue to improve and expand the supply of nuclear weapons for our (US) army, navy, and air force." This State of the Union Address openly declared that the US military budget is further focused on "new weapons, especially new weapons with rapid and devastating offensive power." This means that the American aggressive bloc is not only clamoring for atomic war, but is openly preparing for atomic war. The US is talking lavishly about the peaceful use of atomic energy on the one hand, and openly preparing for atomic war on the other. This more clearly exposes that the US talk about the peaceful use of atomic energy is only an attempt to paralyze the vigilance of people in various countries against the US atomic war conspiracy, so that people in various countries will be caught off guard by the atomic war launched by the US.
    People see that, on the one hand, the American aggressive bloc is occupying our country's territory of Taiwan, establishing military bases and opposing military blocs all over the world, and even preparing for atomic war; on the other hand, it has repeatedly refused to negotiate the European collective security plan proposed by the Soviet Union and the proposal to hold a four-power conference, and has repeatedly obstructed the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. Even for the Asian-African Conference, which aims to enhance mutual understanding among Asian and African countries and discuss promoting world peace and cooperation, it holds a discriminatory attitude. It not only devalues the conference in every way, but is also plotting to obstruct and sabotage the conference. This clearly shows that the American aggressive bloc is unwilling to adopt the method of handling international affairs through peaceful consultation and international cooperation, except for creating division and preparing for war.
    It is very clear that it is precisely the American practice of preparing for a new war and creating divisions everywhere in the world that has caused a serious threat to peace and is increasing the danger of war.
    In order to eliminate this situation caused by American policies, Comrade Malenkov pointed out in his reply to questions raised by Shott that it is necessary to abolish the policy of the United States and its partners, which aims at reviving German militarism that has brought immeasurable disasters to mankind, stop the arms race, and end the policy of encircling peace-loving countries with military bases. Comrade Malenkov also believes that negotiations should be held between the countries concerned to resolve some Far Eastern issues; the fait accompli of unilateral decisions on these or those issues that need to be studied by the four-power conference should not be placed before the heads of government of France, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States. There is no doubt that at present this is not only the right way to resolve existing differences between the United States and the Soviet Union, but also the right way to ease international tensions and consolidate lasting peace.
    As Comrade Malenkov pointed out: At present, no task is more important than the task of uniting the strength of the people of all countries to safeguard peace and international security. The peace-loving people of European countries are continuing to wage a resolute struggle against the revival of German militarism; the people of Asian countries are also making continuous efforts to expand the area of peace. The Chinese people are determined to liberate Taiwan and defend world peace. We firmly support the proposals made by Comrade Malenkov and are willing to unite with the people of all countries in the world to make unremitting efforts to safeguard peace and international security. We firmly believe that if the peace-loving people of all countries can take on the sacred task of defending peace and persevere in it, peace will surely be maintained and consolidated.

    一定要把保障和平的崇高任务担当起来
    今年元旦苏联部长会议主席马林科夫同志对美国“电讯通讯社”华盛顿分社社长萧特所提问题的答复，对当前的国际局势作了精辟的分析；他指出，在目前由于西方国家的过错对和平的威胁正在增加，战争的危险正在增长。马林科夫同志同时指出了保障和平和国际安全的正确道路。马林科夫同志的这一答复，在各国舆论中已经引起巨大反响，获得各国爱好和平人民的热烈拥护，鼓舞起他们争取和平的斗争信心。世界公正舆论认为这是苏联政府和人民对巩固和平事业的一个重要表示。只有美国侵略集团及其追随者在苏联领袖这个答复面前感到慌乱，暴露了它们不要和平的本来面目。
    马林科夫同志说，要保持苏联和美国之间的和平，就要求双方真诚地希望和平并且为它而努力；要求双方考虑和平共处的可能性和必要性以及它们正当的共同利益；苏联“愿意继续尽它的一切力量来保证苏联和美国之间的持久的和巩固的和平关系，来解决现存的分歧，只要美利坚合众国方面也表示同样的意愿”。显然，苏联是愿望和美国和平共处，改善美苏关系并和缓国际紧张局势的。事实上，几年以来，不论在东方和西方，苏联在这些方面作了从不间断的努力并且曾经取得了一些成果，使世界局势有所缓和。目前苏联和美国之间所存在的紧张局势，其责任完全不在苏联方面。
    那么，美国和苏联之间的紧张局势的原因何在呢？马林科夫同志说：“苏联和美国之间的关系中的紧张局势的主要原因是某些美国人士正在采取重建复仇主义的西德军队、进行军备竞赛以及在苏联和其他爱好和平的国家的周围建立美国军事基地网的方针，这种方针只能被认为是准备新战争。”我们完全同意马林科夫同志的这个论断。实际上，美国这种准备新战争的政策，不仅造成了美苏之间的紧张形势，而且也是目前国际局势恶化的根本原因。人所共知，美国侵略集团及其英法追随者不顾苏联和各国爱好和平人民的反对，缔结了巴黎协定，并施用压力使法国国民议会违反法国人民的意志予以批准。美国侵略集团的明显目的，是要把应该由苏联、英国、法国和美国共同处理的德国问题背着苏联作出片面的决定，使德国的和平统一成为不可能，复活西德军国主义，扩大欧洲侵略体系威胁欧洲的和平和安全。在远东，美国侵略集团也正在加紧准备战争和制造分裂的活动。最近美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福的远东之行，就是要重新部署美国的军事侵略力量，加紧重新武装日本，扩大对我国的军事侵略，并且要把蒋介石卖国集团、日本和李承晚集团拼凑成一个东北亚侵略联盟。同时，美国国务院宣布要在二月二十三日召集东南亚侵略集团在曼谷举行会议。这个会议的目的是企图拼凑所谓机动部队来在东南亚进行战争挑衅；是加强并扩大对亚洲各国人民争取和平和民族独立的干涉活动；是企图破坏日内瓦会议协议，破坏东南亚的和平。美国总统艾森豪威尔在六日发表的“国情咨文”，表面上用了一些和平字样，但那准备战争的实质是掩盖不住的。这个咨文自己承认美国的军事预算占美国整个预算的三分之二。它特别强调美国在全世界组织侵略集团，扩大和加强世界的分裂的活动。美国侵略集团还打算把远东的侵略体系，经过它积极策划中的中东侵略组织而与西欧的侵略系统联接起来，对苏联和各爱好和平国家形成一个大的包围圈；这一切都是为了奴役当地的人民，准备新的战争。
    应该指出，在美国准备新战争计划中，原子武器已被当作进行侵略冒险的重要手段。最近，不仅美国驻扎在英国的美国第四十九空军师司令史蒂文森公开宣布，美国已经把英国作为对苏联进行原子轰炸的基地；而且，华盛顿还准备用原子武器装备将来的西德军队。上月中旬在巴黎举行的北大西洋集团理事会会议，更在美国压力下批准了一个准备原子战争计划的“报告”，要把原子武器作为北大西洋侵略集团的常规军备。艾森豪威尔的“国情咨文”公开说：“我们必须继续改善和扩大我国（美国）陆、海、空军的核子武器的供应”。这个国情咨文公然宣布美国的军事预算所更进一步侧重的是
  “新武器，特别是具有迅速的和毁灭性的攻击力量的新武器”。这就是说，美国侵略集团已不仅是在叫嚣原子战争，而是在公开准备原子战争了。美国一面在侈谈原子能的和平利用，一面却公开准备原子战争。这就再清楚不过地暴露了美国关于原子能和平利用的谈论，只是为了企图麻痹各国人民对于美国原子战争阴谋的警惕性，使各国人民对美国发动的原子战争措手不及。
    人们看到，美国侵略集团一方面侵占我国领土台湾，在全世界建立军事基地和对立的军事集团，甚至准备原子战争；另一方面，却多次拒绝商谈苏联提出的欧洲集体安全计划和举行四国会议的建议，多次阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题。甚至对于旨在增进亚非各国的互相了解，讨论促进世界和平合作的亚非会议它也抱着歧视的态度，它不但从各方面贬低这个会议的价值，并且还在策划阻挠和破坏这个会议。这清楚地说明，美国侵略集团除了制造分裂准备战争之外，不情愿采取经由和平协商和国际合作来处理国际事务的方法。
    事情很显然，正是美国准备新战争和在世界各处制造分裂的做法，造成了对和平的严重威胁，并使战争的危险正在增加。
    为了消除美国的政策所造成的这种情势，马林科夫同志在对萧特提出的问题的答复中指出，必须废除美国及其伙伴的目的在于复活曾经给人类带来不可估计的灾难的德国军国主义的方针，停止军备竞赛，结束用军事基地包围爱好和平的国家的政策。马林科夫同志并认为，应该在有关国家之间举行解决若干远东问题的谈判；不应该把关于需要由四国会议研究的这些或那些问题的片面决定的既成事实摆在法国、英国、苏联和美国的政府首脑的会议的面前。毫无疑问，在目前这不仅是解决美国和苏联之间的现存分歧的正确道路，而且也是缓和国际紧张局势、巩固持久和平的正确道路。
    正如马林科夫同志所指出的：目前，再没有什么任务比为了保障和平和国际安全而团结各国人民的力量的任务更为重要的了。欧洲各国爱好和平的人民正在为反对复活德国军国主义而继续进行着坚决的斗争；亚洲各国人民为了扩大和平地区也正进行着不断的努力。中国人民坚决要解放台湾，保卫世界和平。我们坚决支持马林科夫同志提出的主张，并愿意同世界各国人民团结一致，为保障和平和国际安全而努力不懈。我们深信，各国爱好和平的人民如果能够将保卫和平的神圣任务担当起来，并坚持下去，和平就一定能够得到保持和巩固。
