    The development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement nationwide has been relatively rapid. This is mainly because the Party promptly put forward the policy of agricultural collectivization and stipulated correct steps, affirming the current agricultural production cooperative with a semi-socialist nature as the primary form of the agricultural collectivization movement. The movement's march towards victory also stems from the leadership of the Party, which dispatched a large number of outstanding Party member cadres to agricultural production cooperatives to lead and preside in person. In these agricultural production cooperatives, they insisted on implementing the Party's various specific policies and constantly struggled against phenomena that distorted the Party's policies. It can be seen from practical work that one of the main reasons why many excellent agricultural production cooperatives are run well is that these cooperatives have a group of excellent Communist Party cadres.
    Agricultural production cooperatives are a form of socialist or semi-socialist economic organization; however, organizational form is, after all, a form. Everything still depends on the content contained within this form. Having this organizational form does not mean that there is socialist content, nor does it mean that it can increase production, increase members' income, and obey national production plans and agricultural product procurement plans, nor does it mean that it can transform farmers' private ownership ideas and complete agricultural collectivization plans. The primary issue is to see who is leading and presiding over these agricultural production cooperatives. If our Party member cadres are leading and presiding, they can guide farmers to advance on the socialist road; if they are not led and presided over by our Party members, but by rich peasant elements and people with serious capitalist ideas, it is possible to induce some farmers to develop in a capitalist direction. Stalin said that agricultural production cooperatives are like a weapon, "The whole question is in whose hands this weapon is, and against whom this weapon is used." ("Concerning Questions of Agrarian Policy in the U.S.S.R.") If it is in the hands of Communists or progressive masses, it is a revolutionary weapon; if it is in the hands of rich peasant elements and counter-revolutionaries, it is a counter-revolutionary weapon.
    At present, many leading organs and leading cadres of rural Party organizations have precisely failed to recognize this point. They believe that as long as there is this socialist economic organizational form, socialism will naturally emerge. They have this logic: since agricultural production cooperatives are a socialist economic organizational form, it is impossible for them to be utilized by capitalism and become a hidden refuge for capitalist exploitation. Therefore, they adopt an indifferent attitude towards who is leading and who is presiding over agricultural production cooperatives. They are not interested in asking whether the Party organization in this area has led the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and whether Communist Party members have participated in and led the local mutual aid and cooperation organizations; they are not interested in understanding whether the local mutual aid and cooperation organizations have resolutely implemented the Party's policies. They are only interested in numbers and percentages. However, an agricultural production cooperative organization without the Party's specific leadership cannot resolutely follow the socialist road. Especially when encountering difficulties on the road forward, or when tempted by capitalism, they will deviate from the Party's correct line and various undesirable tendencies will occur. It has now been discovered that some agricultural production cooperatives are flying the banner of socialism but are engaged in capitalist transactions. The Jianming Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhenxi Township, Jiaxing County, Zhejiang Province, is one such example. After the rich peasant element Wu Haidi usurped the leadership of this cooperative, he raised the fixed land rent, raised the depreciation costs and usage fees for cattle, farm tools, and boats in the cooperative, and stipulated high-interest free investment methods, using capital to obtain profits and engage in capitalist exploitation. Of course, there are not many such agricultural production cooperatives. However, it is not an isolated case to focus on operating commercial and transportation industries and other exploitative or exploitative businesses instead of focusing on agricultural production, refusing to implement national production plans and agricultural product procurement plans, and advocating the establishment of "three strong" (strong labor, strong livestock, strong land) cooperatives when developing members, and excluding poor peasants. In addition to this, there is destruction from the "left," such as advocating communal eating, communal living, and communal consumption of so-called "advanced cooperatives," deliberately forcing middle peasants to join agricultural production cooperatives, infringing on the interests of middle peasants, and isolating poor peasants. These situations have also been discovered.
    The Party's policies must be implemented by Party organizations and Party members. Implementing the Party's policies naturally requires relying on the masses, but if there is no Party organization to educate the masses and lead the masses, and if no Party members are selected to unite the masses, organize the masses, and transform the Party's policies into the will of the masses, the Party's policies cannot be implemented. Therefore, the Party's leading organs must actively select Party members who truly understand the Party's line and are truly able to strive for the realization of the Party's line to go to various agricultural production cooperatives to directly lead and preside. Party members who are already working in agricultural production cooperatives must be given great care, regularly educated in the Party's policies and other education, and regularly taught various working methods. Party members who are unwilling to participate in agricultural production cooperatives or who are not actively working in agricultural production cooperatives must be educated so that they all understand that the glory of Communist Party members lies in their ability to consciously strive for the realization of the communist cause. Communist Party members in rural areas who are unwilling to participate in agricultural production cooperatives or who are not actively working in agricultural production cooperatives only show that they still lack communist awareness and are not yet qualified to be Communist Party members. As for areas where there are no Party organizations yet, Party organizations should be rapidly developed to adapt to the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. At present, a large part of the country has not yet established Party organizations, and a large part of the villages, although they have established Party organizations, do not yet have the strength to lead agricultural collectivization work. Are there conditions to develop Party organizations now? Obviously, there are. After various political movements, especially the general line propaganda and education and the mutual aid and cooperation movement of the past year, a large number of people with socialist awareness are constantly emerging. Party organizations in various places should, in accordance with the provisions of the Party Constitution, absorb those who already meet the conditions for Party membership into the Party. In recruiting new Party members, we must also adhere to the Party's class policy and first recruit poor peasants who already meet the conditions for Party membership. In areas with few Party members, it is also necessary to continue to develop Party organizations in accordance with the actual situation. However, we cannot arbitrarily lower the basic conditions for Party members in order to develop a batch of Party members. This will not only fail to strengthen leadership over agricultural collectivization, but will weaken leadership over agricultural collectivization.
    The reason why Party organizations select outstanding Party members to go to agricultural production cooperatives is precisely to correctly adhere to and implement the Party's policies. The Party's policies are class-based. When implementing policies, we must rely on the revolutionary class to strike against the hostile class. The Party's class policy in the agricultural collectivization movement is to rely on poor peasants (including all new middle peasants who were originally poor peasants, such poor peasants accounting for 50 to 70 percent of the total rural population), firmly unite with middle peasants, develop mutual aid and cooperation, and gradually limit and finally eliminate rich peasant exploitation. Without first adhering to this class policy, all other Party policies cannot be implemented in the countryside, and all Party resolutions cannot be realized. Because we lack experience in agricultural collectivization, we inevitably make some shortcomings and mistakes in our work; but we should pay special attention to not allowing errors to occur in the implementation of the Party's class policy, or we must pay special attention to correcting such errors, because such errors are fundamental principled errors. Some of our Party member cadres still have some very incorrect understandings of this point. They said: "Most of the existing poor peasants are lazy people and loafers." This statement does not conform to the facts. Although poor peasants also received land and other means of production in the land reform, some people have more difficulties in production and life, so they have not yet turned over; some have also risen to become middle peasants but have been reduced to poor peasants due to natural disasters, man-made disasters, and exploitation. This is just as someone said when complaining about the suffering of the small peasant economy: "The small peasant economy, each family and household, is single-handed and weak, unable to move the head and unable to move the feet," "The small peasant economy cannot withstand wind and rain," "The small peasant economy is a root of poverty." Precisely because of this, it is even more necessary to organize the existing poor peasants into agricultural production cooperatives to help them finally get rid of poverty. Some people also said: "Now middle peasants are the majority, so we should rely on middle peasants." This statement is also inappropriate. Middle peasants are the majority, referring to both new and old middle peasants, but we cannot confuse new middle peasants with old middle peasants. The rising path of new middle peasants is different from that of old middle peasants. They rose to the position of middle peasants because they received land and other means of production in the land reform, and some of them later participated in mutual aid and cooperative production. At the same time, many of the new middle peasants still have difficulties in production and life. The new middle peasants are equally determined in their support of mutual aid and cooperation. It is right to rely on the class that was originally poor peasants and is now new middle peasants, but it is wrong to include old middle peasants in the object of reliance. Some people also said: "Whether they are poor peasants or middle peasants, we can rely on those who are active in production." This statement is also wrong. The development of production must rely on mutual aid and cooperation, and the most active in mutual aid and cooperation are the poor peasants (including all new middle peasants who were originally poor peasants), so we must rely on the poor peasants (including all new middle peasants who were originally poor peasants). There are also people who say: "As long as we rely on poor peasants, it is not important whether we unite with middle peasants." This view is also wrong. Middle peasants (referring to old middle peasants) account for about 30 percent of the rural population; middle peasants also have better livestock and farm tools, and are more experienced in farming, and are an important productive force in the countryside. Therefore, the status of middle peasants in the countryside is not "unimportant", but "pivotal". If middle peasants stand on the side of the working class with poor peasants, the socialist transformation of agriculture will succeed, otherwise, it will fail. Relying on poor peasants (including all new middle peasants who were originally poor peasants) and firmly uniting with middle peasants are unified and inseparable, and are the socialist basis for the Party to carry out socialist transformation in rural areas. By relying on poor peasants and uniting with middle peasants, we can isolate rich peasants, restrict and gradually eliminate the rich peasant economy, and abolish the exploiting classes in rural areas.
    The number of agricultural production cooperatives nationwide has increased from more than 200,000 in the autumn of last year to more than 500,000, and it is estimated that it will increase to about 600,000 this spring. With the rapid development of the agricultural collectivization movement, strengthening the Party organization's leadership over agricultural production cooperatives and selecting outstanding Party member cadres to directly lead and preside over the work of agricultural production cooperatives is a matter that cannot be ignored and is urgent.

### 农村党的基层组织应加强对农业生产合作社的领导

    农村党的基层组织应加强对农业生产合作社的领导
    全国互助合作运动的发展是比较迅速的，这主要是因为党适时地提出了农业合作化的方针，并规定了正确的步骤，肯定了目前以半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社作为农业合作化运动的主要形式。但运动走向胜利还由于得到了党的领导，党派遣了大批优秀的党员干部到农业生产合作社中去，亲自领导，亲自主持。他们在这些农业生产合作社中坚持贯彻了党的各项具体政策，经常向歪曲党的政策的现象进行斗争。从实际工作中可以看出：很多优秀的农业生产合作社办得好，主要的原因之一就是这些社里有一批优秀的共产党员干部。
    农业生产合作社是一种社会主义的或半社会主义的经济组织形式；但是，组织形式毕竟是一种形式，一切还要取决于这种形式容纳着什么样的内容，有了这种组织形式，并不等于就有了社会主义的内容，也不等于就能增加生产、增加社员收入和服从国家生产计划和农产品收购计划，也不等于就能改造农民私有观念，完成农业合作化计划。首要的问题还要看这些农业生产合作社究竟是由谁在领导和主持？如果由我们的党员干部在领导和主持，就能引导农民在社会主义的道路上前进；如果不是由我们的党员领导主持，而由富农分子及资本主义思想严重的人主持，它就有可能引诱一部分农民向着资本主义方向发展。斯大林说过，农业生产合作社就像是一种武器，“全部问题是在于这个武器究竟掌握在谁手中，这个武器究竟是被利用去反对谁。”（“论农村中的工作”）掌握在共产党员或进步群众的手里，它就是革命武器；掌握在富农分子和反革命分子的手里，它就是反革命的武器。
    现在有不少农村党组织的领导机关和领导干部，恰恰没有认识到这一点，他们以为只要有了这种社会主义的经济组织形式就自然而然有了社会主义。他们有这样一个逻辑：农业生产合作社既然是社会主义的经济组织形式，那它就不可能被资本主义所利用，变成资本主义剥削的隐蔽所。因此，对于农业生产合作社是谁在领导、谁在主持的？就采取了漠不关心的态度。对于这个地区的党组织是不是领导了互助合作运动，共产党员是不是参加和领导了当地的互助合作组织，他们也没有兴趣去过问；当地的互助合作组织是不是坚决执行了党的政策，他们也没有兴趣去了解。他们有兴趣的只是数目字和百分比。但是，一个没有党的具体领导的农业生产合作组织，是不可能坚决走社会主义的道路的，特别是在前进路上遇到了困难时，或受到资本主义的引诱时，他们就会离开党的正确路线，发生种种不良倾向，现在已经发现有的农业生产合作社挂着社会主义的招牌，干着资本主义的买卖。浙江嘉兴县真西乡建明农业生产合作社就是这样。这个社被富农分子吴海弟篡夺领导权后，在社内抬高土地定租，抬高耕牛、农具、船只折旧费用和使用的代价，并规定高利息的自由投资办法，以资金获取利润，进行着资本主义剥削。当然，这样的农业生产合作社是不多的。但是，不以经营农业生产为主而以经营商业和运销业等剥削性的或含有剥削性的业务为主，拒绝执行国家生产计划和农产品收购计划，在发展社员时主张成立“三强”（劳力强，牲口强，土地强）的社，排斥贫农则不是个别的，除此之外还有来自左的方面施行破坏，如提倡伙吃伙住，共同生活共同消费的所谓“高级社”，故意强制中农参加农业生产合作社，侵犯中农利益，孤立贫农等等，这些情形也都有发现。
    党的政策必须通过党组织和党员去贯彻。贯彻党的政策自然要依靠群众，但是如果没有党的组织去教育群众、领导群众，而且如果不选拔党员去团结群众、组织群众、把党的政策变为群众的意志，党的政策就不可能贯彻。因此，党的领导机关必须主动地选拔真正懂得党的路线，真正能为党的路线实现而奋斗的党员到各个农业生产合作社中去，直接领导和主持。对已经在农业生产合作社中工作的党员，要十分关怀，经常对他们进行党的政策教育和其他教育，经常教给他们各种工作方法。对于不愿参加农业生产合作社或在农业生产合作社中不积极工作的党员要进行教育，要使他们都懂得：共产党员之所以光荣，就在于他们能够自觉地为共产主义事业的实现而奋斗。在农村的共产党员不愿参加农业生产合作社或在农业生产合作社中不积极工作，只是说明了他还缺乏共产主义的觉悟，他还不够做一个共产党员。至于在还没有党的组织的地区，就要适应互助合作运动发展的情况，迅速发展党的组织。现在全国有很大一部分地区还没有建立党的组织，又有很大一部分乡村虽然建立了党的组织，但还没有力量来领导农业合作化的工作。现在有没有条件来发展党的组织呢？显然是有的。经过各种政治运动，特别是总路线宣传教育和一年来的互助合作运动，大批有社会主义觉悟的分子正在不断涌现，各地党的组织就应当按照党章的规定，将其中已具备入党条件的人吸收入党。在吸收新党员中，同样要坚持党的阶级政策首先吸收已经具备党员条件的贫农入党。在党员少的地区，也需要按照实际情况继续发展党的组织。但是，不能为了发展一批党员，而任意降低党员的基本条件，这样不但不能加强对农业合作化的领导，反而会减弱对农业合作化的领导。
    党组织所以要选拔优秀党员到农业生产合作社去，正是为了正确地坚持贯彻党的政策。党的政策是有阶级性的，在贯彻政策时，必须依靠革命阶级，去打击敌对的阶级。党在农业合作化运动中的阶级政策就是依靠贫农（包括全部原来是贫农的新中农在内，这样的贫农占农村人口总数的百分之五十到七十），巩固地团结中农，发展互助合作，由逐步限制到最后消灭富农剥削。不首先坚持这一阶级政策，党的其他一切政策在农村里就无从贯彻执行，党的一切决议也无从实现。由于我们缺乏农业合作化的经验，在工作中还免不了发生若干缺点和错误；但是我们应该特别注意，不容许在贯彻执行党的阶级政策中发生错误，或者必须特别注意纠正这种错误，因为这种错误是带根本性质的原则错误。在我们的某些党员干部中，对这一点还有一些很不正确的认识。他们说：“现有的贫农大多数是懒汉和二流子。”这种说法，是不符合事实的。贫农在土地改革中虽然同样分得了土地及其他生产资料，但有些人生产和生活中的困难较多，所以还没有翻过身来；也有的曾经上升为中农但因遇到天灾人祸，受人剥削，又降为贫农。这正如有人在诉小农经济苦时说的：“小农经济，一家一户，人单力薄，搬头不动，搬脚不动”，“小农经济经不起风吹雨打”，“小农经济是条穷根子”。也正因为这样，就更加需要把现有贫农组织到农业生产合作社里来，帮助他们最后摆脱贫困。又有人说：“现在中农是多数，所以应当依靠中农。”这说法也不妥当。中农是多数是指包括新老中农在内而言，但不能把新中农和老中农混淆起来，新中农的上升道路不同于老中农，他们是因为在土地改革中分得了土地及其他生产资料，有些人以后又参加了互助合作生产，而上升到中农的地位的。同时，新中农中还有不少人的生产和生活上都还有困难。新中农对互助合作同样是坚决的。依靠原来是贫农今天是新中农的阶层是对的，但因此而将老中农也划入依靠对象则是错的。又有人说：“不管是贫农中农，生产上积极就可以依靠。”这说法也是错误的，发展生产必须依靠互助合作，而对互助合作最积极的就是贫农
  （包括全部原来是贫农的新中农在内），因此也必须依靠贫农（包括全部原来是贫农的新中农在内）。也还有人这样说：“只要依靠贫农，团结不团结中农无足轻重。”这种观点同样是错误的。中农（指老中农）约占农村人口的百分之三十；中农的牲口、农具也都比较好，耕作经验也比较丰富，是农村的一支重要生产力量。因此中农在农村中的地位，不是“无足轻重”，而是“举足轻重”。中农和贫农一道站在工人阶级这一边，农业社会主义改造就能成功，反之，就会失败。依靠贫农（包括全部原来是贫农的新中农在内），巩固地团结中农是统一不可分割的，是党在农村中进行社会主义改造的社会主义基础。依靠了贫农团结了中农，才能孤立了富农，限制并逐步消灭了富农经济，废除了农村的剥削阶级。
    全国农业生产合作社已由去年秋季的二十多万个增加到五十多万个，今春估计将增加到六十万左右。随着农业合作化运动的迅速发展，加强党组织对农业生产合作社的领导，选拔优秀的党员干部直接领导和主持农业生产合作社的工作，是一件丝毫也不能忽视的和刻不容缓的事情。
