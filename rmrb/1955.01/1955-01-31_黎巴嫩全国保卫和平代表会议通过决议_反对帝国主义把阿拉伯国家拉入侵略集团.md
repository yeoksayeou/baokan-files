Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, January 29th: The Second Lebanese National Conference for the Defense of Peace recently took place in Beirut, attended by 350 delegates from all over the country.

    The Lebanese Peace Committee issued a communique on the achievements of the conference. The communique stated that Dr. George Hanna, a member of the World Peace Council, delivered a report at the conference on the dangers of military alliances and blocs to the cause of peace. He pointed out that currently, imperialist countries are exerting strong pressure on Arab countries in an attempt to drag them into the Turkish-Pakistani treaty.

    George Hanna pointed out that this treaty poses a great threat to the people of the Near East, especially after the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council decided to use atomic weapons, because Turkey is a member of this alliance. George Hanna called on peace defenders to strengthen the struggle against the Turkish-Pakistani treaty.

    Tabet, Chairman of the Lebanese Peace Committee, made a report on the peace movement. He emphasized that the most important task for peace defenders at present is to more actively launch the struggle to ban atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction.

    The conference unanimously agreed with the resolution of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council on opposing the threat of the use of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, and passed a resolution to widely launch a campaign throughout the country to collect signatures for the World Peace Council Standing Committee's appeal to the people of the world.

    The conference passed a resolution on the danger of military alliances. The resolution stated that imperialists are constantly attempting to drag Lebanon and other Arab countries into military alliances and blocs. While they are making every effort to do so, they are also putting pressure on Arab countries, attempting to sow discord among the Arab people, making Arab countries provide territory for imperialist military bases, and restoring foreign occupation.

    The resolution stated that all these plans are a direct threat to the security of our people and violate our sovereignty. This is part of the policy of aggressive blocs, the purpose of which is to divide the world into hostile blocs, create new hotbeds of war, and undermine the prospects for universal peace.

    The resolution stated that the participants of the Lebanese National Conference for the Defense of Peace are fully convinced that the peaceful and patriotic forces of our country will unite their strength and once again thwart the plans of the imperialists. They will resist foreign interference in our internal affairs and fight back against the increasing pressure from the imperialists.

    黎巴嫩全国保卫和平代表会议通过决议
    反对帝国主义把阿拉伯国家拉入侵略集团
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社贝鲁特二十九日讯：第二届黎巴嫩全国保卫和平代表会议最近在贝鲁特举行，参加代表会议的有从全国各地来的三百五十名代表。
    黎巴嫩和平委员会发表了关于会议工作成就的公报。公报中说，世界和平理事会理事乔治·汉纳博士在会议上作了关于军事联盟和集团对和平事业的危险性的报告。他指出，目前，帝国主义国家正在对阿拉伯国家施加强烈的压力，企图把它们拖到土耳其—巴基斯坦条约中去。
    乔治·汉纳指出，这个条约对近东各国人民有着巨大的威胁，特别是在北大西洋联盟理事会作出使用原子武器的决定以后，因为土耳其是这个联盟中的成员国。乔治·汉纳号召和平保卫者们加强反对土巴条约的斗争。
    黎巴嫩和平委员会主席塔伯特作了关于和平运动的报告。他着重指出，更加积极地展开禁止原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器的斗争，是和平保卫者们目前主要的任务。
    会议一致同意世界和平理事会常务委员会关于反对使用原子武器和氢武器的威胁的决议，并且通过决议，决定在全国范围内广泛展开为世界和平理事会常务委员会告世界人民书征集签名的运动。
    代表会议就军事联盟的危险性问题通过了一项决议。决议说，帝国主义者不断地企图把黎巴嫩和其他阿拉伯国家拉入军事联盟和集团。他们在竭力这样做的同时，又对阿拉伯国家施加压力，企图在阿拉伯人民之间散播纠纷，使阿拉伯国家提供领土给帝国主义作军事基地，恢复外国的占领。
    决议说，这一切计划是对我国人民安全的直接威胁，并且侵犯我国的主权。这是侵略集团的政策的一部分，其目的是要把世界分裂成敌对的集团，制造新的战争策源地和破坏普遍和平的前景。
    决议说，黎巴嫩全国保卫和平代表会议的参加者完全相信，我国的和平和爱国力量将团结自己的力量，再一次打破帝国主义者的计划。他们将反抗外国干涉我国内政，并且反击帝国主义者的正在加强的压力。
