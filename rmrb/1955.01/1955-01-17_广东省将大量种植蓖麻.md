Guangdong Province is preparing to plant 200,000 mu of castor beans this year. Guangdong is located in the subtropics, where castor beans can grow year-round. In the fields, corners of houses, and edges of gardens of farmhouses, one can often see well-grown, semi-wild castor beans that are unmanaged. Now that these castor beans have borne fruit, the Guangdong Provincial Oil Company began arranging for the purchase of castor bean seeds two months ago. This is the first time that many farmers have seriously collected and processed castor bean seeds and sold them to the state. Currently, the Guangdong Provincial Oil Company has purchased 1,400 dan of castor bean seeds, which is enough for sowing 70,000 mu in the spring. Harvesting can begin four months after planting, and large-scale development can take place in the autumn.

    广东省将大量种植蓖麻
    广东省准备今年种植蓖麻二十万亩。广东地处亚热带，蓖麻可以终年生长。在农家的田头、屋角、园边常常可以见到生长良好而无人管理的半野生的蓖麻。现在这些蓖麻已结实，广东省油脂公司在两个月以前就开始布置蓖麻种籽的收购工作。这是许多农民第一次认真地采集和处理蓖麻籽，并把它卖给国家。现在广东省油脂公司已收购到蓖麻种籽一千四百担，可供春季播种七万亩的需要。下种后四个月就有收获，秋季就可以大量发展了。
