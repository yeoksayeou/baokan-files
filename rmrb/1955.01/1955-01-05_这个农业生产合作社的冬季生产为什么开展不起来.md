The Xing Shan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Weijiazhuang, Linxian County, Henan Province, achieved universal increases in production in the summer and autumn of 1954. Wheat yields averaged 201 jin per mu, and autumn crops averaged 256 jin per mu, exceeding the actual yield of autumn 1953 by 36 jin per mu. Logically speaking, the cooperative members should have been overjoyed, but the reality was not like that. When cadres asked them how the harvest was, the members all said: "Reduced production." When asked what winter production they were engaged in, they all said: "The chairman tells us what to do, and we do it! How could we not listen to his instructions?"

Why were the members' spirits so low? After in-depth investigation and understanding, the following reasons were discovered: First, the members were not clear about the grain purchase policy and were afraid of being asked to sell more grain, so they dared not report the actual yield, and their morale was low. Second, the financial system within the cooperative was chaotic, with all economic expenditures handled solely by the accountant and the chairman. The chairman's leadership was also undemocratic, and he would scold the members at the drop of a hat. Once, member Wei Wujian gave Chairman Wei Wenshu an opinion, asking him to make the cooperative's finances public and not handle everything single-handedly. Wei Wenshu said, "Whoever thinks it's not public enough can come and do it themselves." Member Wei Laofu said, "Joining the cooperative is like entering a sealed gourd; you don't know which way is east, west, north, or south." With everyone's production morale low, even though the Three Autumn campaigns had long ended, they could not quickly enter winter production.

Based on the above situation, the working cadres first conducted ideological education among the members. The vast majority of the members of this cooperative had an incorrect understanding of the relationship between industry and agriculture. Some said, "If we farmers didn't produce grain, what would the workers eat?" The older people were even more confused, believing that farmers were always at a disadvantage. In response to the above thinking, the cadres first led the members in discussions based on the actual situation, so that the members initially clearly realized that national industrialization needed the support of farmers. When industry is developed, the state can supply farmers with more and cheaper new-style farm implements and chemical fertilizers, help farmers use machines to cultivate the land, and help farmers build more water conservancy projects, etc. In this way, the idea of supporting industrialization was initially established in the minds of the members. Then, the accounting method was used to calculate the increase in agricultural and sideline production and changes in living conditions in the whole village in recent years. In 1951, the average yield of grain per mu was 317 jin, and in 1954, the average yield per mu was 375 jin; the income from mountain fruits and outside workers increased by 170 million yuan each year compared with the past. In 1951, the whole village bought 49.2 zhang of cloth, while in the first half of 1954 alone, they bought 656 zhang, and they also used more than 5,000 jin of salt each year than in the past. As a result of this accounting, the farmers deeply realized the reasons for the excess of demand over supply and the correctness of the policy of unified purchase and sale from the improvement of their own lives. But some individual members still reflected: "It is right to sell surplus grain, but we feel that the grain left for us is a bit too little." Li Zhaori, a cadre of the cooperative, explained that the grain left now was not too little based on the actual living conditions of his own family in the past. Then everyone recalled the past life and today's situation and had no objection to the grain left. According to the extrapolation results, the whole cooperative should sell 8,000 jin of surplus grain, and everyone said that they must sell grain to the state in advance to support industrial construction.

After the concerns about the policy of unified purchase and sale were dispelled, the morale of the members generally improved. But some people were still uneasy when they thought of the chaotic financial system within the cooperative and could not immediately switch to winter production. In view of the problems existing in the cooperative, a meeting of members was convened to let everyone put forward their opinions and check the work of the cooperative. The members put forward many long-standing opinions. For example, the labor force of the whole cooperative could not be used in a unified way, and new members still worked individually on some farm work; the cooperative's accountant did not take care of the annual agricultural production investment, and the technicians controlled everything and could not implement planned economic management; the manure used by the members was not priced; the grass mowed from the members' hillsides was not only not priced, but the labor of the grass cutters was not calculated, and so on. The biggest problem raised by the members was the chaotic financial system. The elected grain keeper did not control the warehouse, and the chairman and others could freely withdraw grain from the warehouse; the elected economic keeper had not seen a single banknote, and the cooperative's income and expenditure were handled by the chairman and accountant alone, spending as much as they wanted without the approval of anyone. For example, in the spring of 1954, the members' congress decided to use 2 million yuan to buy two cows to plow the land, but a few cadres violated the resolution of the members' congress and spent 4 million yuan to buy a mule. The livestock and farm implements of the old members who joined the cooperative were originally stipulated to be repaid with principal and interest within three years, but now it has been two years, and no money has been repaid for the principal and interest, and the reason has not been explained, and so on. After democracy was promoted, the morale of the members was greatly improved, and they generally reflected that they had not known the bottom of the cooperative since joining the cooperative, and this time they must thoroughly clean it up.

After these political education and ideological mobilization, the members' enthusiasm for production began to rise; on this basis, all the members were mobilized to find tricks, tap potential, and formulate a winter production plan. In terms of agricultural production, wheat should be universally watered once in winter. It is also planned to build three large toilets to increase fertilizer and improve seven mu of land. In terms of sideline production, members should be mobilized to renovate silkworm slopes to lay the foundation for raising tussah silkworms in 1955. At present, the cooperative is starting winter production while solving the existing problems within the cooperative. The whole cooperative has now cut grass and collected more than 20,000 jin of tree leaves, and all the women have also been mobilized to collect tree leaves.

    这个农业生产合作社的冬季生产为什么开展不起来
    李广平
    河南省林县魏家庄行山农业生产合作社一九五四年夏秋两季普遍增产，小麦每亩平均收成二百零一斤，秋庄稼每亩平均收成二百五十六斤，每亩超过一九五三年秋季实产量三十六斤。按道理来说，社员们该是欢天喜地的，可是实际并不是这样。当干部问到他们收成怎样时，社员们都说：减产了。再问他们冬季在搞什么生产，都说：“社长叫干啥干啥吧！咱还能不听人家指点？”
    社员的情绪为什么这样低落呢？经过深入调查了解，发现有以下一些原因：首先是社员对购粮政策不摸底，怕叫自己多卖粮食，所以不敢报实产量，情绪不高。其次，是社内财物制度混乱，社内的一切经济开支都由会计、社长一手包办。社长领导又不民主，动不动就训斥社员。有一次，社员魏五建给社长魏文书提了一个意见，要他把社内财物公开，不要一手包办。魏文书说：“谁嫌不公开谁来干。”社员未老福说：“入了社真像钻进闷葫芦一样，算是不知东南西北啦。”大家生产情绪低落了，虽然三秋工作早已结束，也不能很快进入冬季生产。
    根据以上情况，工作干部首先向社员进行思想教育。这个社的绝大部分社员对工业和农业的关系存在着不正确的认识，有的说：“不是咱农民生产粮食，工人吃什么？”年老的人更糊涂，认为一切都是农民吃亏。针对以上思想，首先领导社员结合实际情况进行讨论，使社员初步明确认识到国家工业化需要农民的支持。工业发达了，国家就能用更多、更便宜的新式农具和化学肥料来供给农民，帮助农民用机器种地，帮助农民兴修更多的水利事业等。这样在社员思想上初步树立了支持工业化的观点。接着又用算账办法，计算全村几年来农副业增产和生活变化的情况。一九五一年每亩平均收粮三百一十七斤，一九五四年每亩平均收三百七十五斤；山果和外出工人工资两项收入，每年比过去增加一亿七千万元。一九五一年全村买四十九丈二尺，一九五四年前半年就置了六百五十六丈，食盐每年也比过去多用五千多斤。这样算账的结果，农民从自己生活的改善情况，深刻认识到供不应求的原因和统购统销政策的正确性。但仍有个别社员反映：卖余粮是应该，就是给咱留的粮食嫌少些。社的干部李兆日根据他自己家里过去的实际生活情况，说明现在留的粮食并不算少。接着大家又回忆了过去的生活和今天的情况，对所留粮食没有意见了。全社根据推算结果，该卖余粮八千斤，大家表示一定要提前卖粮给国家，支持工业建设。
    对统购统销政策的顾虑解除后，社员情绪普遍提高。但是有些人一想到社内的财物制度混乱，仍是心情不安，不能立即转入冬季生产。针对社内存在的问题，召开了社员会，让大家提意见，检查社的工作。社员提出了许多积压很久的意见。如全社劳动力不能统一使用，新社员在某些农活上还是单干；社内会计不管全年农业生产投资，技术员支配一切，不能实行计划经济管理；用了社员的大粪不作价；搂了社员的山坡草，不但没作价，就连割草人的工也没有计算等等。社员们提出的最大问题是财务制度混乱。选举的粮食保管员没有掌握仓库，社长和其他人可随便到仓支取粮食；选举的经济保管员没有见到一张钞票，社内收支多少，都由社长和会计一手包办，想花多少就花多少，不经任何人批准。如一九五四年春天社员大会决定用二百万元买两条牛耕地，少数干部却违背社员大会决议，竟用四百万元买来一头骡子。老社员入社的牲口、农具，原规定三年本利还清，现已整二年了，本利一文钱都未还，也不说明原因等等。民主发扬以后，社员情绪大大提高，普遍反映说：自入了社没有蹬过社的底，这回可要彻底地清理一下。
    经过这些政治教育和思想发动，社员的生产劲头开始高涨起来；就在这样基础上，发动全体社员，找窍门、挖潜力，订出了冬季生产计划。在农业生产方面要普遍冬浇小麦一次。还计划修大厕三个增加肥料，改良七亩地的土壤。在副业生产方面，要发动社员整修蚕坡，为一九五五年养柞蚕打下基础。目前该社一面着手解决社内存在的问题；一面开始了冬季生产。全社现已割草搂树叶两万多斤，妇女也全部出动搂树叶。
