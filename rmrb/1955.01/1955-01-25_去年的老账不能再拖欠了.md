Last Year's Old Debts Can No Longer Be Delayed
    Zhong Xia

    The agricultural production work for 1955 has already begun, but the profit distribution settlements for 1954 for many agricultural production cooperatives have not yet been completed.

    According to information gathered at the beginning of January, most of the old cooperatives in Shandong Province had not yet carried out distribution settlements, and in the Shijiazhuang Special District of Hebei Province, less than 40% of the old cooperatives had completed their distribution settlements. Some cooperatives "distributed as they harvested" agricultural products according to simple pre-distribution plans at the time of the autumn harvest, but the distribution was very rough; some cooperatives did not carry out distribution at all, but simply "temporarily lent" the cooperative's income to the members; some cooperatives' firewood (straw) was still piled together and had not been distributed. Now that it is the Spring Festival, the members are eagerly requesting to complete the distribution settlement work and carefully calculate the accounts.

    Why has the profit distribution settlement of some old cooperatives been delayed until now? A very important reason is that after the autumn harvest last year, the leadership was busy with the establishment of new cooperatives and the merging and expansion of old cooperatives, and relaxed the leadership over the distribution work. Another reason: when these cooperatives were initially established, they did not make clear regulations on various issues related to distribution; in addition, some of the cooperative's accounting staff were not qualified, and the accounts were very chaotic, which increased the difficulties in distribution, so it was delayed. Another reason is that the late autumn crops were harvested late last year, and the actual output in some disaster-stricken areas changed, so the original distribution methods had to be changed accordingly, so it could not be distributed quickly. In addition, the leadership in some areas focused on the unified purchase and sale of grain after the autumn harvest, relaxing the leadership over the distribution work of the old cooperatives, so that the difficulties in distribution could not be resolved in time, which is also a reason for the delay in the distribution work.

    The failure to carry out distribution settlements in a timely manner has seriously affected the consolidation of some old cooperatives and the production enthusiasm of many members. At the same time, it also affected the views of local new members on the cooperatives, increasing their ideological doubts.

    All cooperatives that have not yet completed the 1954 distribution settlement should quickly carry out the distribution settlement as a major political task. If there are no problems with the original distribution plan, the settlement should be carried out as soon as possible, compensating for shortages and surpluses, and striving to close the accounts as soon as possible. If the distribution plan has not been determined or is unreasonable after it has been determined, the plan should be determined as soon as possible. The depreciated value of livestock and the loans that should be repaid should be cleared as much as possible in the distribution according to the cooperative's production situation.

    Rapidly carrying out the distribution settlement does not mean carrying out the distribution settlement carelessly. This work cannot be done simply by letting the accountant do some calculations. It contains many meticulous and complex political and organizational tasks. In the process of carrying out the distribution settlement, we should summarize the annual production achievements to the members, analyze the reasons for increased or decreased production, and use facts to improve the socialist consciousness of the members. In the distribution process, we must fully promote democracy, check and improve business management; and we must mobilize members to actively invest in the cooperative and expand production. This is a major issue that is directly related to the progress or backwardness of the old cooperatives, and it is also a problem that has a great impact on many new cooperatives around the old cooperatives, and it must not be careless or neglected.

    Spring plowing is about to begin, this work can no longer be delayed, it should be regarded as the first important thing to consolidate the agricultural production cooperatives at present, and it should be done quickly.

    去年的老账不能再拖欠了
    仲夏
    一九五五年的农业生产工作已经开始了，许多农业生产合作社一九五四年的收益分配决算却还没有作。
    据一月初了解的情况，山东省大部分老社都没有进行分配决算，河北省石家庄专区作好分配决算的老社还不到百分之四十。有些社在秋收时候按照简单的预分方案把农产品“随打随分”了，但是分得很粗糙；有些社根本没有进行分配，只是把社里的收入“暂借”给社员了；有些社的柴草（禾秆）还堆在一起没有分。现在已是春节，社员们迫切要求做好分配决算工作，认真把账算好。
    为什么有些老社的收益分配决算一直拖延到现在还没有进行呢？一个很重要的原因是在去年秋收以后，领导方面忙于新社的建立和老社的合并、扩大，放松了对于分配工作的领导。还有一个原因：这些社当初建立的时候，没有把有关分配的各种问题作明确的规定；加以有些社的会计人员不称职，账目很混乱，增加了分配中的困难，因此就拖下来了。再一个原因是去年晚秋作物收获迟，部分受灾区因实产量发生变化，原订分配办法又必须相应地改变，因此不能很快地分配妥当。此外，有些地区的领导力量在秋收以后集中于统购统销，放松了对老社分配工作的领导，使分配中的困难不能及时解决，也是分配工作拖延下来的一个原因。
    分配决算不能及时进行，严重地影响了部分老社的巩固，影响了许多社员的生产情绪。同时也影响了当地新社员对社的看法，增加了他们的思想疑虑。
    一切还没有做好一九五四年分配决算的社，应该赶快把分配决算当作一个重大的政治任务来进行。原订分配方案没有什么问题的，应当尽快地进行决算，长退短补，争取早日结账。分配方案没有确定或已确定而不合理的，要尽快地把方案确定下来。牲畜折价款和应该偿还的贷款，要根据社的生产情况在分配中尽可能地加以清理。
    迅速进行分配决算，绝不是草率进行分配决算。这个工作并不是只让会计员打打算盘就能做好的。它包含着许多细致复杂的政治工作和组织工作。在进行分配决算的过程中，应当向社员总结全年生产成绩，分析增产减产的原因，用事实提高社员的社会主义觉悟。在分配过程中要充分发扬民主，检查和改进经营管理；并且要动员社员积极向社投资，扩大生产。这是和老社的前进或后退有直接关系的重大问题，也是对老社周围的许多新社有很大影响的问题，是绝对草率、疏忽不得的。
    春耕快要开始了，这个工作不可再拖延了，应当把它作为当前巩固农业生产合作社的头一件重要事情，赶快把它做好。
