    Xinhua News Agency, Chengde, January 6th: The CCP Rehe Provincial Committee convened a meeting of county and banner party secretaries and rural work ministers at the end of last year to review the work of developing agricultural production cooperatives, and decided to vigorously rectify newly established agricultural production cooperatives.
    After summer cultivation and before the autumn harvest last year, Rehe Province established 9,497 new cooperatives. Including the original cooperatives, the number of households joining the cooperatives reached 29 percent of the total number of farmers, basically completing the cooperative establishment plan for 1954. Most of these new cooperatives were established on the basis of relatively good year-round mutual aid teams, and more than 80 percent basically met the conditions for establishing cooperatives. However, according to reports from various counties and banners at the meeting, 16.9 percent of the cooperatives were not fully or fundamentally qualified for establishment, and the members' thinking was extremely unstable. Even in the newly established cooperatives that met the conditions, a considerable number of cooperatives had not properly resolved specific issues such as compensation for land and livestock entering the cooperative and distribution ratios, which affected the consolidation of the cooperative. At the same time, due to rashness and impatience in establishing cooperatives, the class policy was not fully reflected, and the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit was not adequately implemented, which also affected the production enthusiasm of some farmers.
    In light of this situation, the meeting decided to temporarily suspend the work of developing agricultural production cooperatives. It is necessary to vigorously rectify the newly established cooperatives. During the rectification, mutual aid teams and individual farmers should be absorbed to participate. Through the rectification, a policy education should be conducted specifically for farmers to expand influence and stabilize farmers' production enthusiasm. The meeting requested that all counties conscientiously hold meetings of district cadres, explain policies and methods, rely on branches, and truly do a good job in rectification work. During the rectification, cooperatives should be classified and ranked according to regional differences, the size of the cooperative, and the degree and number of problems, and carried out in a planned and leadership-led manner. The meeting determined that the rectification of cooperatives should generally be carried out from three aspects: ideological education, implementation of policies, and improving and purifying the organization of the cooperative. Among them, special attention should be paid to implementing the class policy of relying on poor peasants, uniting with middle peasants, and restricting the exploitation of rich peasants, and the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit. When dealing with issues such as compensation for land, livestock, and agricultural tools, and production investment, the consent of both poor and middle peasants must be obtained before a decision can be made. For a small number of members who request withdrawal from the cooperative, if they still insist on withdrawing after persuasion, they should be allowed to withdraw. The meeting also emphasized that through rectification, it is necessary to help the new cooperatives formulate this year's production plan, calculate the three accounts of increased production, expenditure, and distribution, so that members have a clear understanding and a clear goal, in order to encourage members' production enthusiasm. At the same time, it is necessary to combine the establishment of labor organizations and production order to organize members into sideline production and farmland capital construction, so as to prepare for this year's production. In addition, the meeting also studied the issue of consolidating and improving the original cooperatives and rectifying mutual aid teams.
    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, January 6th: Party organizations at all levels in Yunnan Province are paying attention to strengthening the political and ideological education of members of agricultural production cooperatives. The Yunnan Provincial Party Committee has requested that all its subordinate party organizations at all levels regard this work as one of the main tasks of rural propaganda work. Qujing, Chuxiong, Lijiang and other special districts have convened mutual aid and cooperation cadre meetings and representative meetings at the special district or county level to educate them, and then, through them, strengthen the political education of the members. Baoshan, Zhaotong and other special districts and Qujing, Chengjiang, Jinggu and other counties are combining winter production, starting from solving specific problems such as evaluation of production within the cooperatives, pricing of large agricultural tools and draft animals entering the cooperative, and handling public property, to educate the members. The CCP Baoshan Prefectural Committee formulated specific methods, emphasizing the core role of the party's grassroots organizations in carrying out political education work for members, and paying attention to using the members' personal experiences to educate the members. The CCP organizations in Yanjin, Wenshan, Xichou, Qujing and other counties have achieved good results in educating members by commending good people and good deeds. The CCP branch in Sanjia Village Township, Simao County, adopted similar methods to raise the socialist consciousness of the members. Now, the members are actively building water conservancy projects and reclaiming wasteland.
    At present, the political and ideological education work for members of agricultural production cooperatives by the CCP organizations in some areas of Yunnan Province is continuing to deepen from the aspects of summarizing production experience and formulating production plans, and is gradually shifting to a regular basis.

    热河省决定大力整顿新建农业生产合作社
    云南省各级党组织加强农业社的政治工作
   【新华社承德六日电】中共热河省委员会在去年年底召开了县、旗委书记和农村工作部长会议，检查了发展农业生产合作社的工作，决定大力整顿新建的农业生产合作社。
    热河省在去年夏锄后秋收前，共建新社九千四百九十七个，连原有社在内，入社农户已达农民总数百分之二十九，基本上完成了一九五四年的建社计划。这些新社，大部分是在较好的常年互助组的基础上建立起来的，百分之八十以上都基本上具备建社条件。但据各县、旗在会议上汇报：还有百分之十六点九的社，不完全或根本不够建社条件，社员思想极不巩固。即在已具备条件的新建社中，也还有相当一部分社对土地、牲畜入社报酬和分配比例等具体问题未很好解决，因而影响社的巩固。同时，因建社时急躁冒进，体现阶级政策不够，贯彻自愿互利的原则也不够，还影响了部分农民的生产情绪。
    根据这种情况，会议决定，暂时停止发展农业生产合作社的工作。要大力整顿新建社。在整社时，要吸收互助组和个体农民参加，通过整社，具体地向农民进行一次政策教育，扩大影响，以安定农民生产情绪。会议要求各县，要切实开好区干部会议，交代政策和办法，依靠支部，把整社工作真正做好；在整社时，要按地区差别、社的规模大小、问题程度与多少分类排队，有计划有领导地进行。会议确定：对社的整顿，一般要从思想教育、贯彻政策和健全纯洁社的组织等三个方面进行。其中，要特别注意贯彻依靠贫农团结中农限制富农剥削的阶级政策和自愿互利的原则，在处理土地、牲畜、农具报酬和生产投资等问题时，必须贫农和中农一致同意，才能确定。对少数要求退社的社员，经说服后仍坚持退社的，应允许退社。会议还强调指出：通过整社，必须帮助新社订出今年的生产计划，算好增产、开支、分配的三笔账，使社员心里有底有奔头，以鼓舞社员的生产积极性；同时，要结合建立劳动组织和生产秩序，把社员组织到副业生产和农田基本建设中去，以便为今年生产作好准备。此外，会议对巩固和提高原有社以及整顿互助组的问题，也进行了研究。
   【新华社昆明六日电】中共云南省各级组织注意加强对农业生产合作社社员的政治思想教育。云南省委曾要求所属各级党组织把这一工作作为农村宣传工作的主要任务之一。曲靖、楚雄、丽江等专区都已召开了专区或县的互助合作干部会议和代表会议，向他们进行教育，然后，通过他们加强对社员的政治教育。保山、昭通等专区和曲靖、澄江、景谷等县正结合冬季生产，从解决社内评产和大农具、耕畜折价入社以及处理公共财产等具体问题入手，向社员进行教育。中共保山地委订出了具体办法，强调发挥党的基层组织在向社员进行政治教育工作中的核心作用，并注意运用社员的切身体验，教育社员。盐津、文山、西畴、曲靖等县中共组织，通过表扬好人好事，教育社员收效很好。思茅县三家村乡中共支部采用类似办法提高了社员们的社会主义觉悟。现在，社员们正积极兴修水利和开垦荒田。
    目前，云南省部分地区的中共组织对农业生产合作社社员的政治思想教育工作，正从总结生产经验和制订生产计划等方面继续深入并逐渐转入经常化。
