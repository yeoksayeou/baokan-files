Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 11th:

The Second Congress of the All-Indonesia Central Organization of Trade Unions opened in Jakarta on the 9th.

Indonesian President Sukarno, Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo, government ministers, representatives of various political parties including Aidit, Lukman, Njoto, Sudisman, and Sakirman, members of the Politburo of the Indonesian Communist Party, and many other social figures attended the opening ceremony of the conference.

Foreign guests present included Henri Ruindan, representative of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Soviet Ambassador Zhukov, and Xu Li, Counselor of the Chinese Embassy.

Djono, General Secretary of the All-Indonesia Central Organization of Trade Unions, delivered a speech at the meeting. He emphasized that the tasks of the congress were to discuss the expansion of solidarity among Indonesian workers, the struggle to improve workers' lives and win rights, and the defense of national independence and world peace. He announced that the All-Indonesia Central Organization of Trade Unions already has 2,661,970 members and 147 branches throughout Indonesia.

Djono, on behalf of the members of the All-Indonesia Central Organization of Trade Unions, expressed full support for the Asian-African Conference and hoped that the conference would reach a unanimous agreement to expand the peaceful area of Asia and Africa on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. He said that the All-Indonesia Central Organization of Trade Unions opposes any attempt to drag Indonesia into the Manila Treaty Organization or other organizations that constitute foreign interference and endanger world peace and security.

Speaking on the issue of abolishing the Indonesia-Netherlands Federation, Djono said that the All-Indonesia Central Organization of Trade Unions hopes that after the abolition of the federal relationship, measures will be taken immediately to eliminate all Dutch economic and financial privileges.

Referring to embargo measures, Djono said that such measures have caused rubber prices to plummet, many domestic enterprises to close down, reduced national income, and increased unemployment. He said that due to the embargo, Indonesia has lost more than one billion rupiah in the sale of rubber alone, not to mention tin and copra. Speaking about the living conditions of Indonesian workers, Djono said that the living conditions of Indonesian workers are very bad. Moreover, mass layoffs are threatening workers. For example, the Dutch Royal Shell Oil Company has laid off a total of 6,629 workers in the past three years, accounting for 24 percent of all workers. Foreign capitalists have been using this mass unemployment to suppress wage increases and even cut wages and social insurance benefits.

President Sukarno and Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo spoke at the meeting, calling on workers to fight for the defense of national independence and for the defense of world peace.

Henri Ruindan, representative of the World Federation of Trade Unions, also spoke at the meeting. He said that the heroic Indonesian working people will surely win the support and sympathy of the world working class in realizing their ideals.

    印度尼西亚总工会第二届代表大会开幕
    【新华社雅加达十一日电】印度尼西亚总工会第二届代表大会九日在雅加达开幕。
    印度尼西亚总统苏加诺、总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约、政府的部长们、各党派代表包括印度尼西亚共产党政治局委员艾地、鲁克曼、约多、苏蒂斯曼和萨基尔曼，以及其他社会名流多人参加了会议的开幕式。
    到会的外宾有：世界工会联合会代表亨利·儒丹和苏联大使茹科夫、中国大使馆参赞徐力等。
    印度尼西亚总工会总书记约诺在会上发表了演说。他着重指出，大会的任务是讨论扩大印度尼西亚工人的团结、改善工人的生活、争取权利的斗争、以及保卫民族独立和世界和平的问题。他宣布，印度尼西亚总工会已拥有会员二百六十六万一千九百七十人。在印度尼西亚全国设有一百四十七个分会。
    约诺代表印度尼西亚总工会的会员们表示完全支持亚非会议，并且希望这个会议能够达成一致的协议，在和平共处的五项原则的基础上扩大亚洲、非洲的和平地区。他说，印度尼西亚总工会反对想把印度尼西亚拉入马尼拉条约组织，或者其他构成外国干涉和危及世界和平和安全的组织的任何企图。
    在谈到关于废除印度尼西亚—荷兰联邦的问题时，约诺说，印度尼西亚总工会希望在废除联邦关系以后，能够紧接着采取措施，取消荷兰在经济和金融方面的一切特权。
    约诺在谈到禁运的措施时说，这种措施已经使橡胶的价格惨跌，使国内的许多企业倒闭，减少了国家的收入，增加了失业的人数。他说，由于禁运，印度尼西亚单单在出售橡胶方面就损失了十亿盾以上，更不必说锡和椰干了。在谈到印度尼西亚工人的生活条件时，约诺说，印度尼西亚工人的生活条件是很坏的。而且，大量解雇正威胁着工人，例如荷兰皇家壳牌石油公司在过去三年间，共解雇了六千六百二十九名工人，占全体工人的百分之二十四。外国资本家一直利用这种大量失业的情况来压制提高工资，甚至削减工资和社会保险金额。
    苏加诺总统和沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理在会上讲了话，他们号召工人们为保卫民族独立，为保卫世界和平而斗争。
    世界工会联合会代表亨利·儒丹也在会上讲了话。他说，英勇的印度尼西亚劳动人民在实现自己的理想时，必然会赢得世界工人阶级的支持和同情。
