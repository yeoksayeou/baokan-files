Sichuan province's rural youth league organizations and agricultural technology extension stations in various localities are adopting the method of signing agricultural technology guarantee-teaching and guarantee-learning contracts to systematically organize rural youth to learn advanced agricultural production techniques. More than 100 young people in the Fujiang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Suining County, with the help of the agricultural technology extension station, became familiar with rice and cotton seed selection, pest control, management and other techniques last year, and 33 of them learned to use and repair new agricultural tools, as well as prepare pesticide formulations. After the Youth League branch of the Shuanglongtai Agricultural Production Cooperative in Nanbu County signed a technology teaching contract with the local agricultural technology extension station, six young league members, after learning, were responsible for cultivating all 89 mu of cotton in the cooperative using scientific methods.

In order to further promote this system throughout the province, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Youth League and the Sichuan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry recently issued a joint instruction. Now, technology teaching contracts have been widely signed in eight special districts, including Wenjiang, Fuling, and Suining. In Jiangjin Special District alone, the Youth League branches of 48 agricultural cooperatives have established guarantee-teaching and guarantee-learning contract systems with agricultural technology extension stations.

    四川组织农村青年学习生产技术
    四川省农村青年团组织和各地农业技术推广站，采用签订农业技术保教保学合同的方式，有计划的组织农村青年学习先进农业生产技术。遂宁县涪江农业生产合作社的一百多个青年，在农业技术推广站帮助下，去年普遍熟悉了水稻和棉花的选种、治虫、管理等技术，并有三十三人学会使用、装修新式农具，以及配制杀虫药剂。南部县双龙台农业生产合作社团支部和当地农业技术推广站签订技术教学合同后，经过学习的六个青年团员，用科学方法负责栽培了全社的八十九亩棉花。
    为进一步在全省推广这种制度，青年团四川省委和四川省农林厅不久前又发出了联合指示，现在温江、涪陵、遂宁等八个专区都普遍开始签订技术教学合同。仅江津专区就有四十八个农业社的团支部，与农业技术推广站建立了保教保学合同制度。
