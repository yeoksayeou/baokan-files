Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 15th: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an article on the 14th commenting on the Manila Pact group conference to be held in Bangkok, saying that the Bangkok conference, convened by US imperialism and scheduled for February 23, aims to make the aggressive nature of the Manila Treaty more concrete, to intensify the sabotage of peace, prepare for war, and oppose the countries of Southeast Asia.

The article then talked about the task of opposing so-called "subversive activities" that the United States has stipulated for the conference, saying: "Are the national liberation struggles of Asian countries that demand freedom and democracy and oppose colonialism all 'subversive activities' that should be suppressed by the United States and its 'Western bloc' by sending troops?" This argument is a cunning argument used by aggressors to interfere in the internal affairs of Asian countries, prevent Asian people from obtaining national rights, and attempt to make Asian people slaves of imperialism forever.

The article pointed out that the Southeast Asian aggressive group's eight-nation conference is scheduled to discuss the Indochina issue. Now, the people of Indochina and the people of Asia know that South Vietnam is preparing to accelerate the establishment of six new divisions directly commanded and trained by US imperialism. They call these troops "mobile forces." They are preparing to use this force to intensify the suppression of the Indochinese people's desire for peace, unity, independence, and democracy.

The article pointed out that the purpose of the United States and its servants in convening the Bangkok conference is also to accelerate the formation of an aggressive system in the East, echoing the aggressive system in the West.

The article concluded by saying that US imperialism is attempting to intimidate the Asian people with force, but the Asian people have stood up, and no force can intimidate them. The Asian people must intensify the implementation of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence proposed in the statements of the Prime Ministers of China and India and China and Burma, intensify the expansion of peace zones, and strengthen cooperation among Asian countries. The unity of the peaceful forces of hundreds of millions of Asian people is an invincible force that will defeat the conspiracy of US imperialism.

    越南“人民报”揭露美国召集曼谷会议的阴谋
    【新华社河内十五日电】越南“人民报”十四日刊载文章，评论将在曼谷召开的马尼拉侵略集团会议说，由美帝国主义召集将在二月二十三日举行的曼谷会议，目的在使马尼拉条约的侵略性质更加具体化，目的在加紧破坏和平、准备战争、反对东南亚的各个国家。
    文章接着谈到美国为会议规定的所谓反对“颠覆活动”的任务说：难道亚洲各国要求自由民主、反对殖民主义的民族解放斗争都是“颠覆活动”，应该由美国及其“西方集团”派军队来加以镇压吗？这种论调是侵略者用以干涉亚洲各国内政、阻止亚洲人民取得民族权利、企图让亚洲人民永远做帝国主义的奴隶的阴谋的狡猾论调。
    文章指出，东南亚侵略集团的八国会议预定要讨论印度支那问题。现在，印度支那人民和亚洲人民都知道南越准备加速成立由美帝国主义直接指挥和训练的六个新的师。他们把这些军队叫做“机动力量”。他们准备用这种力量来加紧镇压印度支那人民要求和平、统一、独立、民主的愿望。
    文章指出，美国和它的仆从召集曼谷会议的目的还在于加速组成东方的侵略体系，和西方的侵略体系相呼应。
    文章最后说，美帝国主义企图以武力来吓倒亚洲人民，但亚洲人民已经站起来，没有任何力量能吓倒他们了。亚洲人民必须加紧实现中印、中缅两国总理声明中所提出的和平共处的五项原则，加紧扩大和平地区，加强亚洲各国间的合作。千百万亚洲人民的和平力量的团结是一支必胜力量，它将挫败美帝国主义的阴谋。
