U.S. Budget Prepares for Atomic War
Tan Wenrui

    The United States government's budget for the 1956 fiscal year, submitted to the U.S. Congress on January 17, fully reflects the U.S. aggressive clique's heinous policy of stepping up preparations for atomic war.

    According to this budget message, the total expenditure of the U.S. government in 1956 will be 62.4 billion U.S. dollars. Of this, two-thirds, or 40.458 billion U.S. dollars, is used for direct military purposes, and this military expenditure focuses on expanding the atomic strike force of the U.S. armed forces, including strengthening the production and storage of nuclear weapons and expanding the navy and air force that use these destructive weapons.

    The U.S. aggressive clique believes that such a budget openly preparing for atomic war is undisguisedly necessary. Because their purpose is to try their best to publicize the preparation for atomic war every day, trying to make people not think it strange and not stop it. The budget message openly stated that the purpose of the U.S. military budget is to "maintain a strong military posture," and "the main emphasis will be on more effectively utilizing nuclear energy for the development of military activities. New equipment and technologies are now being developed to meet the mobility necessary for the needs of the changed nuclear warfare." The budget message also flaunts U.S. atomic submarines and other weapons of war, saying that the U.S. expansion plan "reflects the rapid technological development of the current nuclear and electronic age."

    If we compare this huge military budget with the meager amount of civilian expenditure, we can more clearly see the degree of fanaticism to which the U.S. aggressive clique's atomic war hysteria has reached. The U.S. budget for 1956 allocated a total of only 2.3 billion U.S. dollars to welfare, health, and education, less than 4% of the total budget expenditure. And the appropriation for the United States to expand the air force for atomic bombing is more than 14.5 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of more than 2.4 billion U.S. dollars over 1955, which is more than six times the welfare, health, and education appropriations. According to the Associated Press, the Pentagon is also preparing to submit a supplementary appropriation plan, requesting an additional nearly 3 billion U.S. dollars for air force and other military construction projects. Hitler used the slogan "guns instead of butter" to force the German people to prepare for war in the past; the U.S. aggressive clique is learning his method. They also talk about the U.S. having "successfully carried out the adjustment from a war economy to a peacetime economy," which is simply self-mockery.

    Since suffering a serious setback in the Korean War, the U.S. aggressive clique has become increasingly keen on relying on nuclear weapons to promote their aggressive policy, so the so-called "atomic strategy" has become the main link in the U.S. preparation for a new war plan. The U.S. government budget for 1956 is a sign that the United States is openly stepping up its atomic war preparations.

    This new U.S. budget is entirely in service of the U.S.'s ongoing policy of preparing for war worldwide. When the budget emphasizes the need to strengthen the air force for atomic bombing, it says that this force should be "supplemented by the forces of allied countries." Of the more than 40 billion U.S. dollars in military expenditure, 4.7 billion U.S. dollars is used for so-called "foreign military assistance." This item alone is more than double the cost of welfare, health, and education for the American people in the budget. As everyone knows, not long ago, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council, under the manipulation of the United States, adopted a plan to accelerate atomic war preparations; at the same time, everyone also knows that the Paris Agreement stipulates that the rebuilt West German army can possess atomic weapons. Obviously, this plan is closely related to the U.S.'s so-called "foreign military assistance." According to Vienna newspapers, former U.S. President Hoover, who recently visited West Germany, has signed a secret agreement with Bonn on the issue of the U.S. supplying West Germany with atomic equipment.

    For a long time, the production of atomic and hydrogen weapons has become a source of huge profits for U.S. monopoly capital. The U.S. government uses the taxes scraped from taxpayers to invest in the establishment and expansion of the atomic industry (this investment has exceeded more than 10 billion U.S. dollars), and hands it over to monopoly organizations for operation according to contracts signed with them, so in fact, it makes these atomic industries completely controlled by a small handful of monopoly capitalists such as Morgan, Rockefeller, Mellon, and DuPont. These seekers of bloody profits do not hesitate to use their mouthpieces to create atomic war hysteria in order to make a fortune, and under this smoke screen, they enable the government to increase the manufacture and storage of nuclear weapons with large appropriations. At the same time, the U.S. monopoly group also hopes to alleviate the U.S. economic crisis through the "chain reaction" of the atomic arms race. Therefore, Eisenhower's announcement that "the operating expenses of the (atomic industry) in 1956 will increase to an unprecedented high amount" and that the U.S. "will continue to strengthen its nuclear weapons storage" is completely in line with the intentions of U.S. monopoly capital.

    At a time when people all over the world are unanimously demanding the unconditional prohibition of weapons of mass destruction and the elimination of the threat of atomic war, the U.S. ruling clique has formulated a budget that openly prepares for atomic war, which can only be regarded as a serious provocation to all mankind. In this way, Washington's decision-makers have completely exposed how hypocritical their claims of prohibiting atomic weapons and peacefully using atomic energy were. Facts have proved that their words of peace are only to deceive the people of the world and divert the attention of the people of the world from their actual actions in preparing for atomic war.

    While deceiving the people with words of peace, Washington is also flaunting and promoting preparations for atomic war, trying to make people accustomed to it and lose their vigilance. This is Hitler's old trick, but this trick did not save Hitler's fate. What's more, today's people are no longer the people of the era when Hitler launched the war. The U.S. aggressive clique's blatant actions in preparing for atomic war can only arouse strong opposition from peace-loving people in all countries of the world. The people will surely launch a more resolute struggle to stop the U.S. aggressive clique's heinous conspiracy to create a devastating disaster for the whole world.

### 准备原子战争的美国预算

    准备原子战争的美国预算
　　谭文瑞
    美国政府一月十七日向美国国会提出的一九五六财政年度的预算，完全反映了美国侵略集团加紧准备原子战争的罪恶政策。
    根据这个预算咨文，美国政府一九五六年度的支出总额为六百二十四亿美元。其中三分之二的四百零四亿五千八百万美元用于直接的军事目的，而且这笔军事开支侧重在扩充美国武装部队的原子攻击力量，这包括加强核子武器的生产和储存，以及扩大使用这种毁灭性武器的海军和空军。
    对于这样一种公开准备原子战争的预算，美国侵略集团认为是毫无隐讳的必要的。因为他们的目的就是要竭力天天宣传准备原子战争，企图使人民不以为怪，不加制止。预算咨文中公开说：美国军事预算的目的是“保持强大的军事阵势”，而“主要侧重点将更有效地利用核子能于军事活动的发展。现在正在发展新装备和技术以便满足已经改变的核子战争的需要所必需的机动性。”这个预算咨文并且炫耀美国的原子潜水艇等战争武器，说美国的扩军计划“反映现在核子和电子时代的迅速的技术发展”。
    如果拿这个庞大的军事预算来和少得可怜的民用开支的数目作一比较，就可以更加清楚地看出美国侵略集团的原子战争歇斯底里已到了何等狂热的程度。一九五六年度美国预算在福利、健康和教育事业方面的拨款一共只有二十三亿美元，不到预算开支总额的百分之四。而美国为了扩充进行原子轰炸的空军力量的拨款就达一百四十五亿余美元，比一九五五年度增加了二十四亿多美元，比福利、健康和教育拨款多出六倍以上。据美联社报道说，五角大楼还准备以后提出一个补充拨款的计划，要求追加近三十亿美元来进行空军和其他方面的军事建设工程。希特勒过去曾经用“大炮代替黄油”的口号来强迫德国人民进行备战；美国侵略集团正在学他的办法。他们还侈谈什么美国已“成功地进行了从战争经济走向平时经济的调整”，这简直是自己讽刺自己。
    美国侵略集团自从在朝鲜战争中遭受了严重的挫折之后，就愈来愈热中于依赖核子武器来推行他们的侵略政策，因此所谓“原子战略”成了美国准备新战争计划的主要环节。一九五六年度的美国政府预算正是美国公开地加紧进行原子备战活动的标志。
    美国这个新预算是完全服务于美国正在全世界推行的备战政策的。这个预算在强调必须加强进行原子轰炸的空军力量的时候，就说这个力量要由“盟国的部队来加以补助”。在四百多亿美元的军事开支中，有四十七亿美元是用于所谓“对外军事援助”的。光这一项，就比预算中对美国人民的福利、健康和教育事业费用多了一倍以上。大家知道，就在不久以前，北大西洋集团理事会才在美国操纵下通过了加速原子备战的计划；同时大家也知道，巴黎协定是规定好了，重建的西德军队是可以拥有原子武器的。显然这种计划和美国所谓“对外军事援助”有密切关系。据维也纳的报纸透露，最近曾到西德去的前美国总统胡佛，已经和波恩就美国对西德供应原子装备问题签订了一项秘密协定了。
    很久以来，原子武器和氢武器的生产就已成为美国垄断资本的巨额利润的源泉，美国政府用从纳税人身上搜刮来的税款投资建立和扩充原子工业（这项投资已超过一百多亿美元），而根据和垄断组织签订的合同交给它们去经营，因此事实上就使这些原子工业完全操纵在摩根、洛克斐勒、梅隆和杜邦等一小撮垄断资本家的手里。这些血腥利润的追求者为了发财，就不惜利用他们的喉舌制造原子战争歇斯底里，而在这种烟幕下，使政府以大量的拨款来增加核子武器的制造和储存。同时，美国垄断集团还希望借着原子军备竞赛的“连锁反应”来缓和美国的经济危机。因此，艾森豪威尔宣布“一九五六年度的（原子工业）的经营费用将增加到空前的最高数额”，以及美国“将继续加强它的核子武器储存”，是完全符合美国垄断资本的意旨的。
    在全世界人民都一致要求无条件禁止大规模毁灭性武器和消除原子战争威胁的时候，美国统治集团却制订了一个公开准备原子战争的预算，这只能被认为是对全人类的严重挑衅。这样一来，华盛顿决策者就完全暴露出了他们所曾作的主张禁止原子武器和和平利用原子能的姿态是何等的虚伪。事实证明，他们的这些和平词令，只是为了要欺骗世界人民，转移世界人民对他们准备原子战争的实际行动的注意。
    华盛顿一方面用和平词令来欺骗人民，另一方面又大吹大擂宣扬准备原子战争，企图使人民习以为常，失去警觉。这是希特勒的老手段，但这种手段并没有挽救希特勒的命运。何况，今天的人民已经不是希特勒发动战争时代的人民了。美国侵略集团明目张胆地准备原子战争的行径，只能激起世界各国爱好和平人民强烈的反对。人民必将展开更坚决的斗争来制止美国侵略集团给全世界制造毁灭性灾难的罪恶阴谋。
