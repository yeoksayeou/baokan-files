Xinhua News Agency, 5th: The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the People's Republic of China, the Ministry of Culture, the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and the All-China Democratic Women's Federation jointly issued a notice today, requiring all rural areas to pay attention to publicizing the Marriage Law during the Spring Festival cultural and artistic activities in 1955.

The notice said: The implementation of the Marriage Law is an important part of carrying out socialist education work among the people, and it is a relatively long-term and regular task. Therefore, all regions should pay attention to publicizing the Marriage Law while carrying out the Spring Festival cultural and artistic activities in 1955.

The notice pointed out: The publicity of the Marriage Law in various regions should be carried out in accordance with the specific local conditions. In areas where freedom of marriage has been basically realized, the focus should be on publicizing new democratic and harmonious families and model couples, publicizing their happy and fulfilling lives, and their active role in agricultural production and mutual assistance and cooperation; in areas where freedom of marriage has not yet been realized, the benefits of freedom of marriage, equality between men and women, and family democracy should be publicized, and the harms of the feudal marriage system should continue to be criticized. However, in minority areas, the customs of local minority nationalities must be respected.

The notice requires the cultural bureaus (departments) of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government to appropriately increase programs publicizing the Marriage Law when organizing their affiliated literary and art organizations to perform in rural areas, based on the above principles.

In the joint instructions of the Ministry of Culture and the Central Committee of the Youth League on strengthening rural Spring Festival cultural and artistic work, the units under the Ministry of Culture and the Youth League committees at all levels, and the relevant associations of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles that have been consulted, should correspondingly increase the content of publicity on the Marriage Law when recommending and producing programs and other publicity materials for Spring Festival cultural and artistic activities.

Civil affairs departments, women's federations, and youth league organizations at all levels should assist cultural departments in recommending and producing literary and art programs and other publicity materials related to the publicity of the Marriage Law, according to the different requirements of different regions.

    内务部、文化部、团中央和全国妇联联合发出通知
    要求各地结合春节文艺活动宣传婚姻法
   【新华社五日讯】中华人民共和国内务部、文化部同中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会、中华全国民主妇女联合会今日联合发出通知，要求各地农村在一九五五年春节文艺活动中，注意进行关于婚姻法的宣传。
    通知中说：婚姻法的贯彻，是对人民群众进行社会主义教育工作中的一个重要部分，并且是相当长期的一项经常工作。因此，各地在开展一九五五年春节文艺活动中，应注意进行关于婚姻法的宣传。
    通知指出：各地对于婚姻法的宣传，应根据当地具体情况进行。在婚姻自主基本上实现了的地区，着重宣传新的民主和睦家庭和模范夫妻，宣传他们幸福美满的生活，以及他们在农业生产和互助合作中所起的积极作用；在婚姻自主尚未实现的地区，应宣传婚姻自主和男女平等、家庭民主的好处，继续批判封建婚姻制度的害处。但在少数民族地区，必须尊重当地少数民族的习惯。
    通知要求各省、自治区、直辖市文化局（处），在组织所属的文艺组织到农村演出时，可根据上述原则，适当增加宣传婚姻法的节目。
    文化部和青年团中央关于加强农村春节文化艺术工作的联合指示中所责成的文化部所辖单位和各级团委，及所商同的文联有关协会，在推荐和制作春节文艺活动的节目及其它宣传材料时，应相应地增加宣传婚姻法的内容。
    各级民政部门、妇联和青年团组织，应根据不同地区的不同要求，协助文化部门推荐和制作有关宣传婚姻法的文艺节目及其它宣传材料。
