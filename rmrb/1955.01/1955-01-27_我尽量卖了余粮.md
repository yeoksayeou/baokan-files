    When selling surplus grain the year before last, I planned to keep more grain, partly because I wanted to wait for the grain price to rise, and partly because having grain in hand made it easier to hire temporary workers during the busy farming season. Later, I decided to sell it. However, seeing a large portion of the grain disappear from my full granary, I always felt reluctant. Others saw that I wasn’t happy about selling grain and criticized me on big-character posters and blackboards as a "typical spontaneous farmer."

    Last June, the government made a unified purchase of wheat. I only harvested three or four hundred jin. The cadres, not understanding the situation, insisted that I sell twelve hundred jin, and said that I was ideologically backward. They kept me and a dozen other middle-income farmers in the ancestral hall for a "meeting." Later, I managed to sell four hundred jin of wheat to get out of trouble.

    From then on, I was afraid of unified purchase and even more afraid of the cadres, avoiding them whenever possible.

    Last autumn, when the rice in the fields was about to ripen, I was both happy and worried: happy about the good harvest, worried about the upcoming unified purchase. I felt very uneasy and desperately asked to join the agricultural producers' cooperative. I thought: if I join the cooperative, things will be easier to handle. The members saw that I was skilled in production and elected me as the production team leader. I became anxious again, fearing that I would have to take the lead in selling grain in the future.

    As the grain unified purchase work was about to be deployed, bad elements spread rumors saying, "This year is the Three Great Supports, the harvested grain will be entirely purchased, leaving only seedlings, buckwheat, and coarse grains for the farmers to eat." Hearing this, I was as anxious as an ant on a hot pot, neglecting production and inquiring everywhere about the unified purchase policy.

    Later, the cooperative chairman and the communist party member of our village, Kong Boying, returned from a meeting in the county and explained the "four retentions" policy to us: retaining enough food for a year, seeds, fodder, and operational grain, and then purchasing the surplus grain. I didn't believe them and suspected they were lying. I thought: during the unified purchase of wheat in the first half of the year, didn't they also say that they would retain this and that, but in the end, I didn't even have seeds left.

    A few days later, the township cadres all returned, and the work team also entered the township. The next day, the township government held a mass meeting. District Chief Xia reported on the grain unified purchase and sales policy and the "four retentions" standards. He also reviewed the shortcomings in the past unified purchase work, stating that this time they would resolutely act in accordance with the policy and ensure that they would not add "caps." After listening to the report, I felt a little more at ease. But I still dared not believe it, thinking: the government's policy is good, but the cadres have many tricks; even if they say "four retentions," won't they just inflate the production figures anyway? That night, I lay in bed without closing my eyes.

    The next morning, Kong Boying and Comrade Pei from the work team came to my door. Before I could greet them, he asked me with a smile, "Shaojun! After listening to the meetings for two days, you shouldn’t have any more concerns in your mind, right?" Seeing that I didn't answer, he asked again, "What aspects of this year's grain unified purchase policy are you still unclear about?" I couldn't help but speak my mind: "The policy is very good, but I'm afraid it won't be implemented according to the policy!"

    Upon hearing this, Boying knew that I still had doubts about the government's policy and the cadres' work style, so he sincerely reviewed the mistakes made in the past grain purchase with me. He said, "That's only because my work method was not good, I had an impatient temper, I only sought to complete the task, and I didn't implement the policy well, turning a good thing into a bad one; I guarantee to change this time." Then Comrade Pei also said, "Last year, the cadres didn't have experience, so it was inevitable that there would be some shortcomings in the work. This year will be different from last year. As long as you report the actual production, we guarantee to act according to the policy, without adding 'caps' or asking for a single grain more."

    The cadres' sincere and patient conversation and their enthusiastic service to everyone loosened the knot in my heart that had been tied for months. I said to Boying, "The past cannot be entirely blamed on you, it's also because I'm stubborn and narrow-minded, which resulted in me selling grain and not daring to show my face for a year. Keeping the surplus grain without selling it will lead to insect infestation, rodent consumption, and mildew in April and May, which is not good for me at all."

    Comrade Pei continued, "Keeping the surplus grain without selling it is not only not good for you, but also detrimental to the country and the masses." He explained to me how not selling surplus grain would affect the country's industrialization and the people's lives. He also repeatedly told me about the benefits of selling surplus grain, which made me understand many things. I also calculated the benefits of unified purchase and sales and national industrial production development for me personally, and realized that selling surplus grain to the state to support industrial construction was the right thing to do.

    After dinner, I rushed to Comrade Pei's place in three strides and reported my grain income truthfully, asking him to calculate how much surplus grain I should sell after the "four retentions." He calculated that I should sell 1,450 jin. He also asked me with great concern, "According to this calculation, is there enough ration left for your family?" I calculated the ration I used to eat and said, "More than enough." That night, at the meeting to report production, I took the lead in reporting the actual production and also reported the sale of 1,450 jin of surplus grain. Several middle-income farmers in my village, seeing that I had reported the production, also reported their production clearly on the spot. At the meeting, I was praised by the cadres, and I also felt very relaxed and happy.

    However, there were still a few middle-income farmers in my village who couldn't understand the idea of selling surplus grain. I said to the work comrades, "Leave a few households to me." I knew that my brother Kong Shaofa and Kong Zhengjia, Kong Qinghua, and Kong Honggui were suffering from the same disease that I had before. When they heard that I had reported the sale of all surplus grain, they came to ask me even before I entered the house, "How much is left at home after you sell so much grain? Is the new wheat sufficient?" I said, "The government's policy is very good. Although I said I sold more than 1,400 jin, not counting the reserves, the supply of both dry and thin meals is sufficient, and if we add vegetables and save a little, there will be more." At first, they didn't believe it, "Are you lying?" I said to them, "Everyone in the village knows me, if you don't believe me, report your production to me and I'll help you calculate it. I'll be responsible if they take a single grain more! Your sow will still have 200 jin of feed grain left!"

    The next day, just as dawn broke, Kong Zhengjia ran over and said to me, "My wife and I turned out and weighed all the grain in the barn last night, and we calculated carefully. According to what you said, my family can sell a full 4,488 jin apart from the 'four retentions' and the sow's feed grain! I originally planned to sell the sow, but now I won't sell it!" In this way, they believed my words, reported their production, and sold off their surplus grain. (Reported by Wang Qiong)

### 我尽量卖了余粮

    我尽量卖了余粮
    孔绍俊
    前年卖余粮时，我曾打算多留一些粮食，一来想等着粮价涨，二来手里有粮食，农忙也好叫零工。后来决定卖了。可是满仓的谷子去了一大半，心里总是舍不得。旁人看我卖粮不痛快，在大字报和黑板报上说我是“典型自发户”。
    去年六月，政府统购小麦，我只打得三、四百斤，干部不了解情况，硬要我卖一千二百斤，还说我思想不通，把我和十几户中农留在祠堂里“开会”，后来我想法卖了四百斤小麦才没事。
    从此，我害怕统购，更害怕干部，不敢见他们的面。
    去年秋天，田里谷子快黄了，我又喜又愁：喜的是丰收了，愁的是统购快来了。我心里很不安，拚命要求加入农业生产合作社。我想：入了合作社，事情总会好办一些。社员见我生产内行，选我当上生产队长。我又着起急来，怕将来卖粮要带头。
    粮食统购工作快布置下来了，坏分子造谣说：“今年是三大支援，打的粮食要统购光，只留秧荪、荞麦和杂粮给农民吃。”我听了，急得真像热锅上的蚂蚁，放着生产不搞，到处打听统购政策。
    后来，社长和湾里的共产党员孔伯英从县里开会回来，向我们解说四留政策，这就是留够一年的口粮，种籽，饲料和活动粮，再收购余粮。我不相信，怀疑他们说假话。心想：上半年统购小麦，不也是说留这留那，结果呢，我连种籽也没留下。
    又过了几天，乡干部都回来了，工作组也进了乡。第二天，乡政府召开群众大会。夏区长报告了粮食统购统销的政策和“四留”标准，他还检讨了过去统购工作中的缺点，表示这次坚决按照政策办事，保证不加“帽子”。听了报告，我心里虽然舒坦了好些。可是还不敢相信，心想：政府的政策好，干部的板眼多；说“四留”，把产量加得高高的还不是一样？这一夜，我躺在床上没合眼。
    第二天一大早，孔伯英和工作组的裴同志上门了。不等我打招呼他就笑嘻嘻的问我：“绍俊！听了两天会，思想该再没顾虑了吧？”见我没回答，又问：“你对今年粮食统购政策还有哪些地方没弄通？”我忍不住说出了心底话：“政策很好，就怕不照政策做！”
    伯英一听，知道我对政府的政策和干部工作作风还有怀疑，便当面向我检讨了过去购粮中的差错。他说：“那只怪我工作方法不好，有个躁性子脾气，光求任务，没把政策执行好，把好事办坏了；这回我保证改过来。”接着裴同志也说：“去年购粮，干部都没有经验，难免工作上有些缺点，今年可不再像去年了，只要把产量报实，我们保证按政策办事，不加‘帽子’，也不多要一粒。”
    干部对我这样诚恳的耐心的谈话，热心为大伙做事，使系在我心上几个月的一个大疙瘩才松开了些。我对伯英说：“过去的事不能全怪你，也是我个死心眼不好，结果粮食卖了，还闹得自己一年没伸头。余粮留着不卖，留到四、五月间，虫吃、鼠耗带霉烂，对自己没有一点好处。”
    裴同志接着说：“余粮留着不卖，不光是对自己没好处，对国家对群众也不利。”他把不卖余粮怎样影响国家工业化、怎样影响群众生活的道理讲给我听。并又反复给我讲卖余粮的好处，使我懂得了很多道理。我自己也算计了一下统购统销和国家工业生产发展对我个人的好处，明白了把余粮卖给国家，支援工业建设是应该的。
    吃罢晚饭，我三脚两步赶到裴同志那里，把粮食收入一五一十的实报了，请他算一算，除了“四留”我要卖多少余粮。他算出我该卖一千四百五十斤。又很关心地问我：“照这样算，留下的口粮你一家人够不够？”我把过去吃的口粮一算说：“够得很”。晚上，在报产量的会上，我首先报实了产量，又报卖余粮一千四百五十斤。我湾里几户中农，见我把产量报出来了，也当场把产量报清了。会上，我受到了干部的表扬，自己也感到非常轻松愉快。
    可是，我湾里还有几户中农对于卖余粮还思想不通。我便向工作同志说：“交几户给我。”我知道我哥孔绍发和孔正加、孔庆华、孔红贵四户中农，是害的我以前的那种病。他们听说我报卖了全部余粮，不等我进屋都来问我：“你卖这多粮，家里还剩多少？接到新不？”我说：“政府政策好得很，我虽说卖了一千四百多斤，除开预备粮不算，两干一稀，接麦足够，要是掺菜节点约，还有多的。”开始他们还有点不相信，“你该不得撒谎吧？”我向他们说：“一个湾的人，你未必不晓得我，要不信，你把产量报给我，我帮你算算，多要了一粒我负责！你的猪娘（母猪）还给留下二百斤饲料粮呢！”
    第二天天刚亮，孔正加跑过来跟我说：“我和老婆昨夜把仓的谷都翻出来称了，也细算了一下，照你说的，我家除开‘四留’和猪娘的饲料粮，足足可以卖四千四百八十八斤！原来我打算把猪娘卖掉，现在也不卖了！”就这样，他们相信了我的话，把产量都报出来了，把余粮卖清。（王琼记）
