    Partial Spring Crops in Yunnan Province Head and Flower
    In some areas of Yunnan Province, the spring crops are generally growing well after field management operations such as weeding and applying topdressing fertilizer. In the warmer climates and earlier planting areas of Quxi, Hekou, Kaiyuan, Jianshui, Jiangchuan, Yongsheng, Huaping, Qiaojia, Fengqing, Tonghai, and other counties along the rivers, the spring crops are budding and heading, and rapeseed, broad beans, and peas have generally flowered and are bearing fruit. In the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, the fields are filled with lush green beans and wheat, growing vigorously. Farmers in various places are strengthening field management with excitement, welcoming the arrival of a bumper harvest. (Zhao Shuairen)

    云南部分小春作物抽穗扬花
    云南省部分地区的小春作物，经过耨锄、施追肥等工作，一般生长良好。在气候温暖播种较早的曲溪、河口、开远、建水、江川、永胜、华坪、巧家、凤庆、通海等县沿江河地区，小春作物正在含苞抽穗，油菜、蚕豆、豌豆已普遍开花结实。在德宏傣族景颇族自治区，田野里豆麦一片碧绿，茁壮可爱。各地农民正以兴奋的心情加强田间管理，迎接丰收的到来。　（赵帅仁）
