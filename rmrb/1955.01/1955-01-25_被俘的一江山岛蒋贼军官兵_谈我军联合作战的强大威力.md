Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Front, January 24th:

    The captured Jiang bandit officers and soldiers of Yijiangshan Island, when talking about the powerful force of our army's joint land, sea, and air operations, still had lingering fears. Xiang Lianyuan, the operations officer of the original Jiang bandit army's "4th Assault Battalion" headquarters, said: On the 18th, as soon as the People's Liberation Army air force squadron flew over Yijiangshan Island, it began a fierce bombing, and the wires connecting the battalion headquarters to the forward positions of the command were all cut off. Ge Tangu, an intelligence staff officer of the Jiang bandit "Yijiangshan Area Command," said that the People's Liberation Army's artillery fire collapsed the shelter of the Jiang bandit army's "Yijiangshan Area Command," and the entire "Command" was in a state of chaos.

    Shen Nansheng, a soldier of the Jiang bandit "4th Assault Battalion," was wounded by our army's artillery shells before being captured. He said: Amid the roaring of artillery fire, I saw many landing craft heading towards us. The People's Liberation Army's warships were also using artillery to bombard the island's positions. The People's Liberation Army's planes were also swooping down over our heads, and bombs and artillery shells were exploding everywhere. Our bunkers were destroyed. As soon as I crawled out of the bunker, the People's Liberation Army soldiers on the landing craft had already rushed ashore and captured me soon after.

    被俘的一江山岛蒋贼军官兵
    谈我军联合作战的强大威力
    据新华社浙江前线二十四日电：在一江山岛战斗中被我军俘掳的蒋贼军官兵，谈起我陆、海、空军联合作战的强大威力时，都还心有余悸。原蒋贼军“突击第四大队”大队部的作战军官相廉远说：十八日上午，解放军空军机群一飞到一江山上空就进行猛烈轰炸，大队部通往司令部前沿阵地的电线都被炸断了。蒋贼“一江山地区司令部”情报参谋葛覃谷说，解放军炮火把蒋贼军“一江山地区司令部”的掩蔽部炸塌了，整个“司令部”都慌乱成一团。
    蒋贼“突击第四大队”的士兵沈南生被俘前被我军的炮弹打伤，他说：在炮火轰鸣中，只见许多登陆艇正向我们开来。解放军的军舰也在用大炮向岛上的阵地轰击。解放军的飞机又在我们头顶上俯冲起来，炸弹、炮弹响成一片，我们的地堡被炸毁了。我刚从地堡里爬出来，登陆艇上的解放军已经冲上岸来，不久就把我俘掳了。
