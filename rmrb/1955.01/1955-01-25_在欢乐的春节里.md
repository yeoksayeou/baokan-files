    Sending Good News to Soldiers
    Before the Spring Festival, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government sent color-printed good news reports to more than 230 soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. The good news reports stated that their relatives had been honorably selected by the people of Tianjin as model military dependents for 1954.
    Among the 203 municipal and district-level model military dependents selected by the people of Tianjin at the end of last year were workers, members of handicraft production cooperatives, engineers, teachers, cooks, and women representatives. The good news reports stated that they not only maintained the glorious tradition of revolutionary soldiers' families, but also had outstanding work achievements. For example, military dependent Wang Ruihua works in the local state-owned Tianjin No. 2 Rubber Factory. She has put forward many rationalization proposals and has been rated as a factory-level labor model and advanced worker for many years. Military dependent Wang Weimin was rated as a flood control model in last year's flood control struggle.
    While the Tianjin Municipal People's Government sent out these good news reports, the military dependents who were elected as models also wrote letters to their loved ones. After military dependent Zhou Kunfang wrote to her son, Wang Shugeng, who is on the front line of coastal defense in East China, she recently received a reply from her son and all the soldiers of his company. The letter stated: We must plant the red flag of victory on Taiwan Island.

    Li Shunda Congratulates Farmers Across the Country on the Spring Festival
    Li Shunda wrote a letter to congratulate farmers across the country on the Spring Festival, and put forward the production increase plan of his agricultural, forestry and animal husbandry production cooperative for this year, to work together with farmers across the country to increase the production of grain, cotton and oil crops, and support the national construction and the struggle to liberate Taiwan.
    The letter said: Dear farmer brothers and sisters across the country! The 1955 Spring Festival is here. As we happily celebrate this grand festival together, I would like to express my warm congratulations to you with infinite excitement. On this joyful day, I believe that none of us will forget that 1955 is the third year of our country's socialist construction, and also a crucial year to ensure the successful completion of the first five-year plan. At the same time, our compatriots in Taiwan are still tragically suffering from the bloody rule of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and are looking forward to our early liberation from the abyss of misery. These sacred undertakings before us are closely related to the peaceful and happy lives of each of us in the future. Therefore, we are required to further unite closely, carry forward the spirit of high patriotism, actively carry out the agricultural patriotic production increase movement centered on the mutual aid and cooperation movement in 1955, and produce more grain, cotton and oil crops according to the national plan, and gloriously undertake the arduous task of supporting national construction and liberating Taiwan. Our Xigou Township Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative guarantees that the total grain crop production per mu this year will increase by an average of 25 jin compared with last year. On the basis of increased production, it is decided that the grain and oil sold to the country this year will exceed 10.5% compared with last year.

    Moving into New Homes to Celebrate the Spring Festival
    Before the Spring Festival, more than 1,400 worker families in the Fuxin Coal Mine moved into new homes. In the more than 2,600 new houses, the owners have satisfactorily arranged their furniture, and the white walls are covered with children's favorite New Year pictures.
    The owners of the new homes have just celebrated the victory of over fulfilling the coal production task for 1954, and now they are happily celebrating the Spring Festival. Many workers went to state-owned stores and cooperatives to purchase various Spring Festival supplies, food, and clothing. Yang Miwen got married just after moving into his new home, and the house was covered with big red double happiness characters.
    In the past few years, the Fuxin Mining Bureau has built thousands of new houses for workers in various mines. However, with the development of production and the increase of workers, housing is still insufficient. Last year, the Mining Bureau continued to invest in building more than 600 new workers' dormitories, and at the same time mobilized and funded employees to build more than 2,000 simple houses on their own, thus enabling several thousand workers and their families who lacked housing to move into new homes before the Spring Festival.

    The Yangtze River in Sichuan is Busy Day and Night During the Spring Festival
    In the misty Chongqing Port, on the morning of the first day of the Spring Festival, twelve ships loaded with New Year goods and passengers broke through the thick fog and sailed along the shallow and rapid Sichuan River to Yichang, Wanxian, Luzhou, Hechuan and other places. Among them were soldiers returning home to visit relatives, as well as employees going to the countryside to conduct worker-peasant friendship celebrations. More than 8,000 passengers traveled on the Sichuan River in two days.
    Before the Spring Festival, the passenger and cargo ships Jingmen, Kuimen, and "Minyi" that arrived in Chongqing from Hankou and Yichang in the midst of ten thousand lights, set off again before dawn the next day. In previous years, many ships were suspended due to the dry season, but now the heroic sailors, relying on their skilled operations and Soviet-style beacons, overcome many difficulties in the dry season, and night-cross the majestic Three Gorges, increasing the ship turnover rate by 20%.
    Lu Yongzhen, the captain of the Jingmen ship, who constantly creates new records, said with confidence: We will welcome the third spring of the country's five-year plan construction with safe and intense navigation.

    "Not Repairing the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, Not Going Home"
    Some projects in the Baolüe section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, which runs across southwest and northwest China, are still under intense construction during the Spring Festival. Air compressors, generators, tractors, rock drills, etc. transferred from other places were successively transported from Baoji to the construction site. The railway workers laboring in the high mountains and ridges are in high spirits. The workers of the Fourth Engineering Bureau are striving to complete the temporary road bridge ahead of schedule and have decided not to take a vacation during the Spring Festival. The workers of the Sixth Engineering Bureau have expressed that "they will not go home until the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is repaired." Before the Spring Festival, cars flowed from Baoji City to the Qinling Mountains to transport materials.
    This year, the road construction project in the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is extremely difficult. In the construction section of more than 230 kilometers, it is necessary to tunnel through the dangerous Qinling Mountains and cross the Jialing River sixteen times. The line passing through the Jialing River Gorge has steep mountains, complex geology, many long tunnels and high bridges, which poses great difficulties for the project. In order to strive for rapid and comprehensive progress of the project, various types of machinery and migrant workers are constantly being transferred from all over the country to support the Baolüe section project. This year, the Fourth and Sixth Engineering Bureaus and the Tunnel Engineering Company have formulated plans to train technicians and cadres during construction. The Fourth Engineering Bureau plans to train 300 middle school students to become various technical cadres.

    在欢乐的春节里
    把喜报寄给战士
    春节前夕，天津市人民政府把彩印的喜报，寄给中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军的二百三十多名战士。喜报中说明他们的亲人已光荣地被天津市人民评选为一九五四年度的军属模范。
    去年年底天津市人民选出的二百零三名市级和区级军属模范中，有工人、手工业生产合作社社员、工程师、教师、炊事员和妇女代表。喜报中说明他们不但保持了革命军人家属的光荣传统，并且有出色的工作成绩。如军属王瑞华，在地方国营天津橡胶二厂做工。她曾提出许多合理化建议，连年被评为厂级的劳动模范和先进工作者。军属王维敏在去年的防汛斗争中，曾被评为防汛模范。
    在天津市人民政府把这些喜报寄出的同时，当选为模范的军属也纷纷写信给自己的亲人。军属周坤芳给她在华东海防前线的儿子王树耕去信后，最近接到了她儿子和她儿子所在连队的全体战士的复信。信上表示：一定要把胜利的红旗插上台湾岛。

    李顺达向全国农民贺春节
    李顺达写信向全国农民祝贺春节，并提出自己的农林畜牧生产合作社今年的增产计划，来和全国农民一道努力增产粮、棉和油料作物，支援国家建设和解放台湾的斗争。
    信上说：亲爱的全国农民兄弟们！一九五五年春节来到了。在我们愉快地一同度过这个盛大节日的时候，让我以无限兴奋的心情向你们表示热烈的祝贺。在这欢乐的日子里，相信我们都丝毫不会忘记一九五五年是我们祖国进行社会主义建设的第三年，也是保证第一个五年建设计划完满实现的关键性的一年。同时台湾同胞还悲惨地遭受着美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团的血腥统治，盼望我们早日从水深火热中把他们解放出来。摆在我们眼前的这些神圣事业，都和我们每个人将来的和平幸福生活密切相关。因此要求我们进一步紧密团结起来，发扬高度的爱国主义精神，在一九五五年内积极开展以互助合作运动为中心的农业爱国增产运动，按照国家计划，生产更多的粮食、棉花和油料作物，光荣地承担起支援国家建设和解放台湾的艰巨任务。我们西沟乡农林畜牧生产合作社保证今年全社每亩粮食作物比去年平均增产二十五斤，在增产基础上决定今年卖给国家的粮食和油料比去年超过百分之十点五。　（新华社）
    搬　进　新　居　过　春　节　
    春节前夕，阜新煤矿有一千四百多户工人和家属搬进了新居。在二千六百多间的新住宅里，主人们已满意地布置好家具，白粉墙上贴着孩子们喜爱的新年画。
    新居的主人们刚庆祝过超额完成一九五四年产煤任务的胜利，现在又欢度春节了。许多工人到国营商店和合作社购买了各种春节的用品、食品和衣料。杨密文刚搬进新居就结了婚，屋里贴满了大红双喜字。
    几年来，阜新矿务局给各矿工人建筑了几千间新住宅。但随着生产发展，工人增加，住宅仍感不足。去年，矿务局曾一面继续投资新建了六百多间工人宿舍，一面发动和资助职工自己出钱出力，新建了二千多间简易住宅，因而使缺乏住宅的几千工人和家属，在春节前夕搬进了新居。　（新华社）
    春　节　川　江　日　夜　忙
    浓雾迷漫的重庆港，春节第一天清晨有十二艘满载年货和客人的轮船，冲破大雾，沿着漕深水急的川江，驶往宜昌、万县、泸州、合川等地，其中有回乡探望亲人的战士，也有前往农村进行工农友谊联欢的职工，两天有八千多客人旅行在川江上。
    春节前夕，在万家灯火中由汉口、宜昌抵达重庆的荆门、夔门、“民意”等客货轮，第二天天不亮就又出发了。往年这个时候许多船因枯水而断航，现在英勇的海员们，却凭着熟练的操作和苏式灯标，战胜枯水季节的许多困难，夜渡雄伟的三峡天险，将船舶周转率提高百分之二十。
    不断创造新记录的荆门号船长卢永慎满怀信心地说：我们要以安全紧张的航进迎接祖国五年计划建设的第三个春天。
    “不修通宝成路不回家”
    横贯我国西南和西北的宝成铁路宝略段的某些工程在春节中仍紧张施工。外地拨来的空气压缩机、发电机、拖拉机、开山机等陆续由宝鸡运往工地。劳动在高山峻岭的铁道工人情绪高昂，第四工程局工人争取提前修好便道大桥，决定春节不休假，第六工程局工人纷纷表示“不修通宝成铁路不回家”。春节前夕，汽车由宝鸡市川流不息地向秦岭运输物资。
    今年，宝成铁路北段筑路工程极为艰巨。在长达二百三十多公里的施工地段，要穿凿艰险的秦岭，横跨嘉陵江十六次。沿嘉陵江峡谷通过的线路，山势陡峭，地质复杂，长隧道和高桥梁很多，给工程造成巨大困难。为争取工程迅速、全面进展，全国各地不断调来各式机械与民工支援宝略段工程，今年第四、第六两工程局和隧道工程公司等已拟出在施工中培养技工和干部的计划。第四工程局计划训练三百名中学生成为各种技术干部。
