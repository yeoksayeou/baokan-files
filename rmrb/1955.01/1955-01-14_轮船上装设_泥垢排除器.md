"Mud and Scale Remover" Installed on Ships

Zhu Ziqiang, a mechanical worker at the Suzhou branch of the state-owned Jiangsu Provincial Inland River Shipping Company, studied advanced Soviet experiences and designed a "Mud and Scale Remover" to clean boiler water on ships. The first "Mud and Scale Remover" produced has been tested on the Jiangsu Tugboat 008, and the results are very good. After the tugboat sailed for 427 hours, the amount of scale removed was one-third less than the scale removed after sailing for 80 hours in the past. In the past, the ship had to be shut down for 24 hours to clean the boiler scale every 80 hours of sailing, resulting in 1,037 hours of docking each year. Now, if the scale is cleaned every 427 hours, the ship can sail for 35 more days per year. At the same time, less scale in the boiler water also saves fuel consumption. If all state-owned ships in the province are equipped with this "Mud and Scale Remover," it can increase the nation's production by 8 billion yuan annually.

    轮船上装设“泥垢排除器”
    国营江苏省内河轮船公司苏州支公司机务工作人员朱自强，学习了苏联先进经验，设计了一种“泥垢排除器”，来清理轮船上的锅炉用水。制成的第一只“泥垢排除器”，已在江苏拖○○八号轮船上试用，效果很好。这只拖轮航行四百二十七小时后所清理的水垢，比过去航行八十小时的水垢还要少三分之一。过去每航行八十小时，就要停航二十四小时来清洗锅炉的水垢，每年就要停泊一千零三十七小时；现在如果按四百二十七小时清理一次水垢计算，全年就可以多航行三十五天。同时，锅炉水的水垢少，还节省燃料的消耗。全省国营轮船都装置这种“泥垢排除器”，每年就可为国家增产八十亿元。
