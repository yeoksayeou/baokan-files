Xinhua News Agency, Rome, January 2nd: "Unità" published a statement by the leadership of the Italian Communist Party regarding the Italian Lower House's approval of the Paris Agreements.

The statement said: The approval of the Paris Agreements, while representing some progress in the reactionary direction of the Italian political situation, also demonstrates that the policy of war and adventure embodied by the Paris Agreements is encountering enormous opposition in Italy, and that activists of the ruling party are uneasy about the inevitable and extremely serious consequences of this policy.

The statement said: One of the most serious facts related to the Paris Agreements is that the North Atlantic Alliance Council, which met in Paris not long ago, adopted decisions related to preparations for atomic warfare. All proposals from the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies advocating cooperation and the conclusion of agreements to consolidate peace have been rejected, and negotiations for the peaceful reunification of Germany have also been rejected.

The statement said: All people of goodwill should unite today and strive to change the government's foreign policy orientation and shatter the heinous plans of imperialism. The Party leadership recognizes the gravity of the current situation and directs the entire Party to unanimously launch necessary activities and struggles with renewed energy to stop the hands of those who are preparing for a new war of terror. To this end, the strength of the people must be widely mobilized. It is necessary to call on all who love peace and are willing to unite to save peace to engage in an intense struggle against the heinous plans of imperialism. All the strength of the Party should be mobilized to fight in this direction.

The statement concluded by announcing that the Fourth National Congress of the Italian Communist Party would be held in Rome from January 9th to 14th.

    号召全党积极斗争动员人民反对帝国主义的罪恶计划
   【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社罗马一日讯：“团结报”刊载了意大利共产党领导机关就意大利下院批准巴黎协定所发表的声明。
    声明说：巴黎协定的批准固然是意大利政局朝着反动的方向有了一些进展，然而同时也表明，由巴黎协定所体现的战争和冒险政策在意大利遭到极大的反对，执政党的活动分子对于这个政策的不可避免的极其严重后果是不安的。
    声明说：同巴黎协定有关系的一个最严重的事实是：不久以前在巴黎聚会的北大西洋联盟理事会采取了有关准备原子战争的决定。苏联和人民民主国家的主张合作和缔结巩固和平的协定的一切建议都被拒绝了，和平统一德国的谈判也被拒绝了。
    声明说：一切善良的人今天都应该团结起来，努力奋斗，以改变政府的外交政策方针，粉碎帝国主义的罪恶计划。党的领导机关认识到当前局势的严重性，责成全党一致以新的精力展开必要的活动和斗争，来制止那些准备新的恐怖战争的人们的手。为此，必须广泛动员人民的力量。要号召一切热爱和平、愿意团结起来挽救和平的人进行紧张的斗争，反对帝国主义的罪恶计划。党的全部力量都应该动员起来朝着这个方向奋斗。
    声明最后宣布，意大利共产党第四次全国代表会议将于一月九日至十四日在罗马举行。
