Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 18th: According to TASS, an experts' meeting of the seven nations of the "Western European Union" (Great Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg) opened on the 17th at the Palais de Chaillot in Paris. This meeting will discuss the establishment of a "Joint European Military Equipment Production Organization."

　　The suggestion to establish "military equipment coordination" was put forward by Mendès-France at the London Conference. This suggestion proposed establishing a joint organization for the production, standardization, and distribution of military equipment, as well as for the supervision of military equipment. However, the United States opposed this suggestion from the beginning because it plays a major role in this issue and is unwilling to assume any obligations in distributing the weapons it supplies to Western Europe. Besides the United States, Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Belgium also expressed clear opposition.

　　After encountering opposition, the French government prepared a new proposal, which was put forward in its memorandum of January 3. This memorandum stipulates that the establishment of "military equipment coordination" should be carried out in two stages: the first stage is the preparation stage, and the second stage (starting from January 1, 1957) is the final stage.

　　However, the second proposal put forward by the French government still encountered difficulties, because most of the countries concerned, including West Germany, showed a cold attitude towards "military equipment coordination." Although West Germany agreed with the French proposal, it refused any supervision.

　　This meeting was convened under tense internal struggles, the root cause of which is the conflict of interests of the arms magnates of various countries. The Paris newspapers almost unanimously expressed a pessimistic view of this meeting. For example, "Le Figaro" pointed out that "France's plan has little chance of being realized" because serious differences were discovered in the discussion of this issue. The negotiation of this issue will be "long and complicated." "Combat" wrote: "Mendès-France's plan has been reduced in size after Rome (referring to negotiations with the Sheerba government) and even smaller after Bonn. What remains will be cut off in Paris." "Perspectives" believes that no matter how you look at it, "this plan is a difficult birth." It pointed out that the first plan was not adopted at the London Conference. Furthermore, it said that if the "military equipment coordination agency" is to distribute American weapons and dollars, then it "will become a tool of the United States," but if the United States still distributes its weapons according to its own will as before, then the "military equipment coordination agency" is equivalent to a sham. The difficulties in realizing "coordination" thoroughly refuted the claim of the supporters of the Paris Agreement, who once insisted on convincing the members of the French National Assembly that the establishment of "coordination" was a means of "controlling" German armament.

### 讨论建立“军备统筹机构”问题  “西欧联盟”七国举行专家会议

    讨论建立“军备统筹机构”问题
    “西欧联盟”七国举行专家会议
   【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：“西欧联盟”七国（英国、法国、西德、意大利、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡）专家会议十七日在巴黎夏乐宫开幕。这次会议讨论建立“欧洲军备生产联合机构”问题。
    建立“军备统筹”的建议是孟戴斯—弗朗斯在伦敦会议上提出的。这个建议提出要建立一个关于军备的生产、标准化和分配以及关于对军备进行监督的联合机构。但是，美国从一开始就反对这种建议，因为它在这个问题上起主要作用，它不愿意在分配它所供应西欧的武器方面承担任何义务。除美国以外，提出明显的反对的还有英国、荷兰和比利时。
    法国政府碰到反对意见之后，就准备了一项新的建议，这就是在它的一月三日的备忘录中提出的。在这份备忘录中规定分两个阶段来建立“军备统筹”：第一阶段是准备阶段，第二阶段（从一九五七年一月一日开始）是最后阶段。
    但是法国政府提出的第二个建议也还是碰到了困难，因为大多数有关国家包括西德在内都对“军备统筹”表示冷淡。西德虽然同意法国的建议，但是它拒绝任何的监督。
    这次会议是在紧张的内部斗争的情况下召开的，这个内部斗争的根源就是各国军火大王的利害冲突。巴黎各报纸对这次会议几乎一致表示了悲观的看法。例如，“费加罗报”指出，“法国的计划很少有实现的机会”，因为在讨论这一问题中发现了严重的分歧。这个问题的谈判将是“长期的和复杂的”。“战斗报”写道：“孟戴斯—弗朗斯的计划经过罗马后（指和谢尔巴政府的谈判）已经被削小了，经过波恩后又被削得更小了。剩下来的还要在巴黎加以截切。”“展望周报”认为不管从那方面看来，“这个计划是难产的”。它指出第一个方案在伦敦会议上没有通过。并且说，如果“军备统筹机构”将要分配美国武器和美元，那么它“就成为美国的工具”，但如果美国仍然和以前一样地随它自己的意志分配自己的武器，那么“军备统筹机构”就等于虚设。实现“统筹”所产生的困难彻底驳倒了巴黎协定支持者的说法，他们曾经硬要法国国民议会的议员相信：建立“统筹”是“控制”德国武装的手段。
