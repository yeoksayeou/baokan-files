Based on continuous production development, the 3rd, 5th, and 6th loading and unloading zones (with approximately 3,700 basic workers) under the Shanghai Port Authority have implemented labor insurance starting from January 1, 1955. Other zones will implement it successively in the first quarter of this year.

The news of the implementation of labor insurance has further boosted the dockworkers' enthusiasm for labor. Cai Guangfu, a worker in the 6th loading and unloading zone, recalled that before liberation, he worked on the docks for more than ten years, but even with a child, he couldn't support the family and had to give the child away. After liberation, his life continuously improved, and now he enjoys labor insurance. Moved to tears, he said to other workers, "The days of wearing sacks as clothes will never come again. We must guarantee even better labor." Instances of exceeding production plans are constantly emerging in various loading and unloading zones. The 4th team of the 3rd loading and unloading zone and the 27th team of the 6th loading and unloading zone have exceeded production quotas by 5% to 46% for three consecutive days. The 15th team of the 6th loading and unloading zone exceeded the hold work quota by 31%, creating a new hold work record. The workers unanimously proposed to guarantee attendance during the Spring Festival, use their brains, improve production efficiency, and strive to complete the production tasks for 1955.

    实施劳动保险鼓舞了码头工人的劳动热情
    在不断发展生产的基础上，上海港务管理局所属第三、第五、第六装卸区（约有三千七百多个基本工人）已从一九五五年元旦起实施劳动保险。其他区也将在今年第一季度先后实施。
    实施劳动保险的消息传出后，码头工人们的劳动热情更加高涨。第六装卸区工人蔡广福想起解放前在码头上干了十几年，有了一个孩子还养活不了，送了别人；在解放后他的生活不断提高，今天又享受到劳动保险，感动得流了泪，他向别的工人说：“用麻袋当衣服穿的日子再不会来了，我们一定要保证更好的劳动。” 各个装卸区不断出现超额完成生产计划的事例。第三装卸区第四小组和第六装卸区二十七组连续三天超额百分之五到百分之四十六突破生产定额。第六装卸区十五小组做括舱超额百分之三十一，创造了括舱新纪录。工人们一致提出在春节期间保证出勤率，开动脑筋，提高生产效率，争取一九五五年生产任务的完成。（本报上海记者站）
