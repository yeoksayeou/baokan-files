Organizational Regulations for Urban Residents Committees
(Adopted at the Fourth Meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on December 31, 1954)

Article 1: In order to strengthen the organization and work of street residents in cities, enhance the public welfare of residents, residents committees may be established in districts under the jurisdiction of cities and cities without districts, under the guidance of the people's committees or their dispatched organs, according to residential areas.
    The residents committee is a mass self-governing residents' organization.

Article 2: The tasks of the residents committee are as follows:
    (1) To handle matters related to the public welfare of residents;
    (2) To reflect the opinions and demands of residents to the local people's committee or its dispatched organs;
    (3) To mobilize residents to respond to government calls and abide by the law;
    (4) To lead mass public security and defense work;
    (5) To mediate disputes among residents.

Article 3: The organization of the residents committee is as follows:
    (1) Residents committees should be established according to the residential situation of residents and with reference to the jurisdiction of the public security household registration sections, generally with a range of one hundred to six hundred households. Residents committees shall have residents groups under them; residents groups generally consist of fifteen to forty households. The maximum number of groups set up by each residents committee shall not exceed seventeen.
    (2) Residents committees shall have seven to seventeen members, composed of one member elected by each residents group; and the members shall elect one director and one to three deputy directors from among themselves; one of them must be in charge of women's work. Each residents group shall have one leader, who shall generally be concurrently held by a member of the residents committee; when necessary, one to two deputy leaders may be elected. When a member of the residents committee is elected as director or deputy director, the group that elected him/her may elect another leader.
    (3) Residents committees with fewer residents generally do not have working committees, and the members of the residents committee shall take charge of various tasks through division of labor. Residents committees with more residents, if the work really requires it, may, with the approval of the municipal people's committee, establish permanent or temporary working committees to carry out work under the unified leadership of the residents committee. Permanent working committees may be established according to social welfare (including preferential treatment), public security and defense, culture, education and health, mediation, women's work, etc., with a maximum of no more than five. Temporary working committees shall be announced for revocation when the work is completed. Working committees should absorb active elements from the residents to participate, but should try to ensure that one person holds one position as much as possible, so as not to overburden their work.
    (4) Counter-revolutionaries and other persons deprived of political rights in the residents should be incorporated into residents groups, but shall not serve as members of the residents committee, leaders of residents groups, or members of working committees; when necessary, the leaders of residents groups have the right to stop them from attending certain meetings of the residents group.

Article 4: The term of office of the residents committee is one year.
    When a member of the residents committee is unable to hold office due to any reason, a replacement can be elected or a supplementary election can be held at any time.

Article 5: Organs, schools, and larger enterprises, etc., generally do not participate in the residents committee, but should send representatives to participate in the meetings convened by the residents committee that are related to them, and abide by the resolutions and covenants of the residents committee concerning the public interests of residents. Employee residential areas and larger collective dormitories where enterprise employees live in concentrated areas should establish residents committees under the unified guidance of the people's committees of cities under the jurisdiction of districts and cities without districts, or the employee family committees organized by the trade union should concurrently serve as the work of the residents committee.

Article 6: In areas where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities in cities, residents committees may be established separately; for households with a small number of households, residents groups may be established separately.

Article 7: If the working departments and other organs of the people's committees of cities and districts under the jurisdiction of cities must assign tasks to the residents committee or its working committee, they should be assigned uniformly with the approval of the people's committees of cities and districts under the jurisdiction of cities. The working departments of the people's committees of cities and districts under the jurisdiction of cities may provide professional guidance to the relevant working committees of the residents committee.

Article 8: Residents should abide by the resolutions and covenants of the residents committee regarding public interests. When the residents committee is carrying out its work, it should fully promote democracy in accordance with the principle of democratic centralism and voluntary participation by the masses, and shall not engage in coercion and commandism.

Article 9: The public miscellaneous expenses of the residents committee and the living allowances of the members of the residents committee shall be allocated uniformly by the people's committees of the provinces and municipalities directly under the Central Government, and the standards shall be stipulated separately by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

Article 10: The expenses required by the residents committee to handle the common welfare matters of the residents may be raised from the relevant residents in accordance with the principle of voluntariness, with the consent of the relevant residents and with the approval of the people's committees of the districts under the jurisdiction of the city and the cities without districts. Other than this, no donations or fund-raising shall be conducted from the residents.
    The funds raised for common welfare and the account books of expenditures shall be announced in a timely manner after the matter is completed.
