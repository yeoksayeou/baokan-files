Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd: Last year, rural areas in various regions organized families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary servicemen, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers to engage in production along the path of mutual aid and cooperation, achieving remarkable results. According to preliminary statistics from partial areas in twenty-one provinces, over 60% of families of martyrs, families of servicemen, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers participated in mutual aid and cooperative organizations. In the Northeast, North China, and Shandong, regions with a better foundation for mutual aid and cooperation, participation in mutual aid and cooperative organizations was over 80%. Many women from families of martyrs and servicemen who had never worked in the fields also enthusiastically participated in agricultural labor and learned agricultural production techniques. Due to their active participation in production, household income increased. In Yishui County, Shandong Province, the production income of 6,000 families of martyrs and servicemen who participated in mutual aid and cooperative organizations increased by an average of 30% last year compared to before they participated in mutual aid and cooperative organizations. Many disabled revolutionary soldiers also had suitable work they were capable of doing after participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations. Wei Laizhang, a disabled revolutionary soldier from Zichang County, Shaanxi Province, only had one hand, making production difficult for himself; after joining the cooperative, the cooperative, seeing that he had experience in raising sheep, assigned him to raise sheep, so that his work points were assessed the same as the full labor force in the cooperative, and he received the same income.

In order to help families of martyrs and servicemen solve the difficulties of participating in production, local people's governments also drew funds from preferential treatment funds to purchase a large number of means of production such as draught animals and farm tools and distributed them to them. The work of plowing land on behalf of poor families of martyrs and servicemen without labor or lacking labor has also been greatly improved in various places. With the development of mutual aid and cooperative organizations, most of the land cultivated on behalf of others has been successively cultivated by mutual aid teams or agricultural production cooperatives. According to surveys in partial areas of Shanxi, Hebei, Jilin, Rehe, and Shandong provinces, land cultivated on behalf of others by mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives accounts for 70% of all land cultivated on behalf of others. This fundamentally changed the overlapping phenomenon of substitute cultivation organizations and production organizations, and improved the quality of substitute cultivation work. In Nanfeng Village, Luan County, Shanxi Province, the 24 households of martyrs and servicemen whose land was cultivated on their behalf by the agricultural production cooperative harvested an average of 345 catties per mu last year, an increase of 64% per mu compared to the 1953 mutual aid team's cultivation on their behalf. In Tantou Township, Yujiang County, Jiangxi Province, the 1.2 mu of dry land cultivated on behalf of serviceman Wu Meida by the Wu Nianda mutual aid team yielded only two dan of rice in 1953; after the mutual aid team helped him convert it into paddy field in 1954, it yielded six dan of rice. As the income of the families of martyrs and servicemen increased, their lives improved.

Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd: People's governments at all levels are very concerned about the education of the children of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary servicemen. In 1954, the state allocated more than 100 billion yuan from preferential treatment funds as subsidies for poor children of martyrs and servicemen to enter primary school. According to preliminary statistics from 50 counties in Hebei, Shanxi, Rehe, Gansu and other provinces, and Tianjin and Xi'an, 101,500 people received school enrollment subsidies. In Dalian-Lushun and Xi'an, all school-age children of martyrs and servicemen have entered primary school.

In addition to providing enrollment subsidies to poor children of martyrs and servicemen, the state has also established some schools for children of martyrs to educate and care for orphans of martyrs.

    各地农村组织烈属军属参加生产
    国家关怀和照顾烈士和军人子女入学
    【新华社二十二日讯】去年各地农村组织革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人按照互助合作的道路从事生产，获得显著成绩。据二十一个省部分地区的初步统计，烈属、军属、革命残废军人、复员建设军人参加互助合作组织的占百分之六十以上。在东北、华北和山东等互助合作基础较好的地区，参加互助合作组织的在百分之八十以上。不少从未下地做活的烈属、军属妇女也都热情地参加了农业劳动，并且学会了农业生产技术。由于她们积极参加生产，家庭收入增加了。山东省沂水县参加互助合作组织的六千户烈属、军属，去年生产收入平均比参加互助合作组织以前增加了百分之三十。许多革命残废军人在参加互助合作组织后，也有他们力能胜任的适当工作可做。陕西省子长县革命残废军人魏来章，只有一只手，自己生产困难；入社后，社里看到他有养羊的经验，就分配他喂养羊，这样使他和社里的整劳动力评到一样的工分，得到同样的收入。
    各地人民政府为帮助烈属、军属解决参加生产的困难，还从优抚事业费中抽款购买大批耕畜、农具等生产资料发给他们。各地为贫苦无劳动力和缺乏劳动力的烈属、军属代耕的工作，也有了很大的改进。随着互助合作组织的发展，大部分代耕土地都先后改由互助组或农业生产合作社代耕。据山西、河北、吉林、热河，山东等省部分地区的调查，由互助组、农业生产合作社代耕的土地，已占全部代耕土地的百分之七十。这就从根本上改变了代耕组织和生产组织重叠的现象，并提高了代耕工作的质量。山西省潞安县南冯村由农业生产合作社代耕的二十四户烈属、军属的土地，去年平均每亩收获三百四十五斤，比一九五三年互助组代耕时每亩增产百分之六十四。江西省余江县滩头乡吴年达互助组给军属吴梅达代耕的一亩二分旱地，一九五三年的收获只相当于两担稻谷；一九五四年互助组帮他改为水田后，收了六担稻谷。由于烈属军属们的收入增加，生活都有了改善。
    据新华社二十二日讯：各地人民政府非常关怀对革命烈士和革命军人子女的教育。在一九五四年内，国家从优抚事业费中拨款一千多亿元作为对贫苦的烈士、军人子女入小学的补助费。根据河北、山西、热河、甘肃等省的五十个县和天津、西安两市的初步统计，领到入学补助费的有十万零一千五百人。旅大、西安两市的烈士、军人学龄子女已全部入了小学。
    国家除对贫苦的烈士、军人子女给予入学补助外，还开办了一些烈士子女学校，教养烈士遗孤。
