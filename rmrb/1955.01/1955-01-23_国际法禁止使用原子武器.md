International Law Prohibits the Use of Atomic Weapons
Chen Tiqiang, Director of the China Political Science and Law Association

    On the 17th of this month, the Soviet Council of Ministers announced that the Soviet Union is prepared to provide scientific, technological, and industrial assistance to China and other countries in promoting research on the peaceful uses of atomic energy. This is a brilliant manifestation of the Soviet Union's peace policy. At the same time, the atomic war clamor of the American aggressive bloc has intensified. They are gradually turning verbal intimidation into action, attempting to push the world step by step to the brink of atomic war.

    In order to conceal its crimes, the American aggressive bloc is spreading a distorted argument, saying that atomic weapons have acquired "conventional status," making people think that atomic weapons are "conventional" combat weapons just like a pistol or a hand grenade. They are trying to make people believe that as long as a convention prohibiting atomic weapons (as well as hydrogen weapons and other weapons of mass destruction) has not been signed, the use of atomic weapons is not illegal.

    This trick of the American imperialist propagandists is actually very clumsy, because inhumane weapons of mass destruction have long been prohibited by international law.

    Weapons prohibited by international law can be roughly divided into two categories: one is weapons that massively destroy civilian lives and property; the other is weapons that, although used against military targets, have killing methods that are too cruel, causing the attacked to suffer unnecessary pain or unnecessarily placing them in a position of certain death. Atomic weapons can be said to have both of these characteristics and are the most barbaric and inhumane of all weapons. Due to its great destructive power, its destructive range cannot possibly be limited to military targets alone, and civilians who have nothing to do with combat will inevitably suffer the same tragic fate. On the other hand, the harm of atomic weapons to people is very cruel. The radioactive particles of atomic bombs contain toxins. The hydrogen bomb explosion on Bikini Island proved that this "dead ash" can make humans, animals, and plants sick and die. This kind of toxic weapon is also expressly prohibited by international law.

    The basic spirit of international law regarding the means of warfare is: war is only for subduing the resistance of the enemy's army; violence that exceeds what is absolutely necessary to achieve this goal is illegal. Regarding this point, the St. Petersburg Declaration of 1868 should be mentioned first. The preamble of the declaration states:

    "The only legitimate object which states should endeavor to accomplish during war is to weaken the military forces of the enemy." So, it is very clear that the massacre of civilians and the infliction of additional pain or death on enemy soldiers who have lost their combat effectiveness are unnecessary and illegal. Therefore, the declaration also stipulates: "The employment of arms which uselessly aggravate the sufferings of disabled men, or render their death inevitable, is contrary to the laws of humanity."

    Similarly, Article 22 of the Hague Regulations on Land Warfare of 1899 and 1907 stipulates: "The right of belligerents to adopt means of injuring the enemy is not unlimited." This means that in war, it is not the case that any weapon can be used; the use of some weapons is explicitly illegal. Article 23 of the regulations more specifically stipulates some prohibited uses of weapons: "(a) To employ poison or poisoned weapons; ... and (e) To employ weapons, projectiles, or material calculated to cause unnecessary suffering" are specially prohibited. Article 25 prohibits "attack or bombardment, by any means whatsoever, of undefended towns, villages, dwellings, or buildings." Article 27 stipulates that during sieges and bombardments, "all necessary steps must be taken to spare as far as possible buildings dedicated to religion, art, science, or charitable purposes, historic monuments, hospitals." The Hague Regulations have been ratified by the majority of countries in the world, including the United States and Britain. These rules have become universally recognized codes of conduct. These rules absolutely exclude the use of weapons of mass destruction such as atomic bombs, which is absolutely certain and without question.

    The draft "Hague Rules of Air Warfare" of 1923, which is more relevant to air combat, specifically prohibits air attacks on civilians. Article 22 of the regulations stipulates: "Aerial bombardment for the purpose of terrorizing the civilian population, of destroying or damaging private property of a non-military character, or of injuring non-combatants is prohibited." Article 24(a) stipulates that aerial bombardment can only be limited to the military objectives expressly listed in the regulations. Article 24(c) stipulates: "The bombardment of towns, villages, dwellings or buildings not in the immediate vicinity of the operations of land forces is prohibited." These provisions place very strict demands on the bombing party, and the use of atomic weapons is impossible to meet these requirements in any way.

    Although the 1923 regulations have not been ratified by various countries, they are an application of the basic laws of war in air combat and therefore have the nature of declaring customary international law. During World War II, Japan, Britain, France, and Germany all expressed their willingness to abide by these provisions, although Japan and Germany later broke their promises.

    In July 1932, the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference passed a resolution: "Air attacks against the civilian population must be absolutely prohibited."

    In September 1938, the 19th General Assembly of the League of Nations passed a resolution stating that although the bombing of civilians is prohibited by the general principles of international law, several rules are established for clarification: (1) Intentional bombing of civilians is illegal; (2) Legal military objectives must be targeted; (3) When bombing legal military objectives, civilians in the vicinity must not be bombed due to negligence.

    On December 11, 1946, the United Nations General Assembly unanimously passed a resolution confirming that "genocide is a crime under international law, condemned by the civilized world." On December 9, 1948, the General Assembly approved a "Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide," which stipulates in Article 1: "The Contracting Parties confirm that genocide, whether committed in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under international law which they undertake to prevent and to punish." Mass destruction of peaceful residents is one type of genocidal act.

    The bombing of civilians is not permitted by international law, and this point has also been acknowledged by the US government. On September 23, 1937, the US government issued a statement saying: "This government believes that the widespread bombing of a large area inhabited by a large number of people engaged in peaceful life is unreasonable and violates the laws of humanity." On September 1, 1939, US President Roosevelt issued a statement denouncing the bombing of civilians and undefended cities as "inhumane acts of barbarism." As mentioned above, atomic weapons, due to their strong toxins, are also subject to the provisions of international law on the prohibition of poisons and poisoned weapons. The prohibition of the use of poisons in warfare has long been a customary law. The Hague Conference of 1899 passed a "Declaration concerning Asphyxiating Gases," which expressly prohibited it. Although the United States opposed it at the time, it has in essence accepted the same obligation under the provisions of Article 23 of the Land Warfare Regulations. The United States has repeatedly attempted to circumvent this obligation by refusing to ratify treaties on the prohibition of chemical and bacteriological weapons (such as the 1925 Geneva Protocol), but in reality, these treaties are merely declarations of existing customary rules, and non-ratification of these treaties does not diminish the effectiveness of customary law in the slightest.

    The effectiveness of this customary law has been acknowledged by many US laws and the statements of government officials. For example, in the 1922 Washington Conference, the Land Armament Advisory Committee of the US delegation stated in a report: "Chemical warfare is intolerable to civilization and should be prohibited between nations. It is a cruel, unfair, and unjust use of science; it poses extremely serious dangers to non-combatants and will destroy the good nature of mankind." At the same time, the US Naval Bureau's report also stated: "The trend of modern warfare regulations is toward limiting the use of weapons that cause unnecessary suffering... According to this general principle, gases that cause unnecessary suffering should be prohibited." The report also said: "There are two principles of war: (1) Combatants should be spared unnecessary suffering; (2) Innocent non-combatants should not be harmed. These two principles have been accepted by the civilized world for more than a hundred years. The use of poisonous gas in violation of the above principles is condemned by almost the entire world today." US Chief Representative Root, who attended the Washington Conference, emphasized when submitting a draft convention on the prohibition of poisonous gases: "The declaration prohibiting poisonous gases should be regarded as a reaffirmation of the rules passed in the Hague Conference." It can be seen that the US government itself has affirmed that the rule on the prohibition of poisonous weapons was already in existence.

    Evidence of the recognition of these rules in US laws themselves is also frequently seen. For example, the US "Army Ordinance" of 1863 stipulated that "the use of poison in any manner... should be completely excluded in modern warfare. Whoever uses it places himself outside the laws and customs of war." Article 25 of the "US Basic Battlefield Manual" of 1940 also stipulates: "Military necessity does not permit the execution of cruel acts... nor does it permit the use of poison in any way, or the wanton destruction of an area."

    During World War II, US President Roosevelt issued a declaration on June 8, 1943, condemning the use of "poison gas or other inhuman methods of warfare." He said: "The use of these weapons has been considered illegal by the general opinion of civilized humanity."

    The facts cited above irrefutably prove that weapons like atomic weapons, which are highly toxic and inhumanely massacre civilians on a large scale, have long been directly or indirectly prohibited by international law. The fact that the term "atomic weapons" cannot be found in international conventions does not mean that it is legal. Even if, to take a step back, there is no international convention expressly prohibiting this kind of weapon, customary international law is still fully applicable to it. The Nuremberg and Tokyo International Military Tribunals judged German and Japanese war criminals based on this principle. The Nuremberg Tribunal stated in its judgment:

    "The law of war is to be found not only in treaties, but in the customs and practices of states which gradually obtained universal recognition, and from the general principles of justice applied by jurists and practiced by military courts. This law is not static, but is continuously modified to adapt to the needs of an ever-changing world. Indeed, in many cases, treaties merely express and stipulate existing legal principles for more accurate application."

    Both the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 confirmed this basic principle. The preambles of the conventions state:

    "Until a more complete code of the laws of war has been issued, the High Contracting Parties think it right to declare that in cases not included in the Regulations adopted by them, populations and belligerents remain under the protection and governance of the principles of the law of nations, as they result from the usages established among civilized peoples, from the laws of humanity, and from the dictates of the public conscience."

    Another passage in the Nuremberg judgment further affirmed that the Hague Conventions have the nature of customary international law, saying: "The rules stipulated in the Hague Conventions were recognized by all civilized countries by 1939 and were considered a declaration of the laws and customs of war referred to in Article 6(b) of the Charter (referring to the Charter of the Tribunal)."

    In addition, Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice stipulates that the Court shall apply: (c) "International custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law;" (d) "The general principles of law recognized by civilized nations."

    From this, it can be seen that we can find the legal basis for prohibiting atomic weapons not only from the express provisions of international conventions, but also from international customs. As shown above, this basis is very sufficient and as solid as iron. The propagandists of the American aggressive bloc think that as long as they flatly deny that there is such a provision, as long as they bite their teeth and do not sign a convention on the prohibition of atomic weapons, they can do whatever they want without being subject to legal sanctions. However, "the meshes of the law are wide, but nothing escapes them." If the American warmongers ignore these laws and dare to launch an atomic war, then the fate of Tojo, Hitler, and Mussolini will be a lesson for them. Now the angry roar of people all over the world against atomic weapons has shaken the world, and their voices have given these internationally recognized regulations unparalleled moral and material strength. This call is a serious warning to those who are preparing for atomic war, and makes the world not have the slightest misunderstanding about the illegality of atomic weapons and the extreme hatred of the people of the world for it. It is impossible for the launchers of atomic war to pretend to be ignorant and try to escape the just sanctions of the people.

    国际法禁止使用原子武器
    中国政治法律学会理事  陈体强
    本月十七日，苏联部长会议宣布，苏联准备在促进原子能和平用途的研究方面给予中国和其他国家以科学、技术和工业上的帮助，这是苏联和平政策的光辉表现。与此同时，美国侵略集团的原子战争叫嚣更变本加厉了。他们正在把口头上的威吓逐渐变为行动，企图一步步地把世界推向原子战争的边缘。
    美国侵略集团为了掩蔽它的罪行，散布一种歪曲论调，说原子武器已取得“常规地位”，使人以为原子武器也和一枝手枪或一枚手榴弹一样是一种“常规”的作战武器。他们企图使人相信，只要还没有签订一项禁止原子武器（以及氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性的武器）的公约，使用原子武器就不是非法的。
    美帝国主义宣传者的这种障眼法实际上是非常拙劣的，因为大规模毁灭性的非人道的武器，老早以来就已为国际法所禁止。
    国际法所禁止的武器大致可分为两类：一类是大规模毁灭平民生命财产的武器；一类是虽然用于军事目标，但其杀伤方式过于残忍，使被击中者遭受不必要的痛苦，或不必要地置其于必死之地。原子武器可以说兼具了这两种性质，是所有武器中最野蛮的、最灭绝人性的。由于它的破坏力之大，它的破坏范围绝不可能仅以军事目标为限，势必使和作战无关的平民同遭惨祸。另一方面，原子武器对人的伤害是非常残忍的，原子弹的辐射微粒带有毒质，比基尼岛氢弹爆炸证明，这种“死灰”可以使人类和动植物生病而致死亡。这种带毒的武器也是为国际法所明文禁止的。
    国际法关于战争手段的规定的基本精神是：战争只是为制服敌人军队的抵抗；超过为达此目的所绝对必需的暴力都是非法的。关于这一点首先要提到一八六八年的圣彼得堡宣言，该宣言序文称：
  “国家在战争中唯一合法的目标只是削弱敌人的军队。”那么，很显然，屠杀平民以及使已失去战斗力的敌方士兵遭受额外痛苦，或使其死亡，都是不必要的和不合法的。因此该宣言又规定：“使用加剧受伤者之痛苦或致其必死之武器，乃是违反人道之法则。”
    同样，一八九九年及一九○七年海牙陆战法规第二十二条规定：“交战国对于采用伤害敌人的手段的权利不是无限制的。”这就是说，在战争中并不是要使用什么武器便可以使什么武器，有些武器的使用是明确地非法的。该法规第二十三条更具体规定一些禁止使用的武器：“（甲）凡使用毒物或有毒武器……以及（戊）凡使用导致不必要痛苦之武器、子弹或物质均须特别予以禁止。”第二十五条禁止“对不设防的村镇、居住区或建筑无论以任何方法加以攻击或轰炸。”第二十七条规定：于围攻及轰炸时，“应尽量避开为宗教、艺术、科学、慈善等目的之用的房屋、历史碑碣、医院等。”海牙法规经全世界大多数国家批准，其中包括美英等国在内。这些规则已成为世界公认的行为准则。这些规则绝对排除像原子弹之类的大规模毁灭性武器的使用，那是极其肯定，毫无问题的。
    更切合于空战情况的一九二三年“海牙空战法规”草案具体地禁止对平民进行空中攻击。该法规第二十二条规定：“为使平民发生恐怖，为对非军事性质的私人财产加以毁坏或损害，或为伤害非战斗员之目的而进行空中轰炸、应予禁止。”第二十四条（甲）规定空中轰炸仅能以该法规所明文列举的军事目标为限。第二十四条（丙）规定：“轰炸不紧接陆上部队作战地点之城镇、村庄、居住区或房屋，应予禁止。”这些规定对轰炸一方的要求是非常严格的，使用原子武器无论如何是不可能符合这些要求的。
    一九二三年法规虽然未经各国批准，但系战争基本法规在空战方面的应用，因此具有宣示国际习惯法的性质。第二次世界大战中，日本、英国、法国、德国均曾表示愿意遵守这些规定，虽则日德等国后来都背弃了诺言。
    一九三二年七月，裁军会议一般委员会曾通过决议：“对平民的空中攻击，应予绝对禁止。”
    一九三八年九月，国联第十九届大会通过决议称：虽然轰炸平民已为国际法一般原则所禁止，但为明确起见订立规则数条：（一）故意轰炸平民为非法；（二）必须以合法的军事目标为目标；（三）轰炸合法军事目标时不得因疏忽而炸及附近平民。
    一九四六年十二月十一日联合国大会一致通过决议，确定“屠杀群体是违反国际法的犯罪行为，为文明世界所谴责”。一九四八年十二月九日大会批准一项“防止及惩办屠杀群体公约”，该公约第一条规定：“各缔约国重申：屠杀群体，无论在平时或在战时，是一种违反国际法的罪行，各缔约国承允加以防止和惩办。”大规模毁灭和平居民就是屠杀群体的行为之一种。
    轰炸平民为国际法所不许，这点并且也由美国政府加以承认。一九三七年九月二十三日，美国政府曾发表声明称：“本政府认为，对一个住有大量从事和平生活的居民的广大地区加以普遍轰炸是毫无道理的，且系违反人道法则的。”一九三九年九月一日，美国总统罗斯福发表声明，痛斥轰炸平民与不设防城市的行为是“不人道的野蛮行为”。如上所述，原子武器由于其带有强烈的毒素，国际法上关于禁止毒物及有毒武器的规定，同样对它是适用的。禁止在作战中使用毒物，很早以来就已成为一种习惯法。一八九九年海牙会议曾通过一项“关于窒息性毒气的宣言”，加以明文禁止。当时美国虽然加以反对，但在实质上它已根据陆战法规第二十三条的规定而接受了同样的义务。美国后来历次企图以拒绝批准关于禁止化学及细菌武器的条约（例如一九二五年日内瓦议定书）的方法来规避这种义务，但实际上这些条约无非是现行习惯规则的宣示，不批准这些条约丝毫不减损习惯法的效力。
    对于这种习惯法的效力，许多美国的法令和政府官员的言论都曾加以承认。例如在一九二二年华盛顿会议中，美国代表团陆军军备咨询委员会在一项报告中曾称：“化学战为文明所不容，应在国家之间予以禁绝。它是科学的残酷、不公平、不正当的使用；它对于非战斗员有极严重的危险，且将破坏人类良好的本性。”同时，美国海军总局的报告也说：“现代战争法规的趋势是走向限制使用造成不必要痛苦的武器……按照这个一般原则，造成不必要痛苦的气体应予禁止。”该报告又说：“战争有两个原则：（一）应避免使战斗员受不必要的痛苦；（二）无辜的非战斗员不应加害。这两个原则已被文明世界接受了一百年以上。违反上述原则使用毒气，在今天是几乎被全世界所谴责。”出席华盛顿会议的美国首席代表罗脱在提出关于禁止毒气的公约草案时曾着重指出：“禁止毒气的宣言应认为海牙会议中通过的规则之重申。”可见，美国政府自己已肯定了关于禁止有毒武器的规则是原已存在的。
    在美国自己法令中承认这些规则的证据也是数见不鲜的。例如美国一八六三年的“陆军律令”曾规定，“毒物的任何方式的使用……应在现代战争中完全排除。谁要使用它，谁就把自己置于战争法规和习惯之外。”一九四○年“美国基本战地手册”第二十五条也规定：“军事必要并不容许施行残酷的行为……亦不容许用任何方法使用毒物，或将一个地区滥行破坏。”
    第二次世界大战期间，美国总统罗斯福于一九四三年六月八日发表宣言，谴责“毒气或其他不人道的作战方法”之使用。他说：“这些武器的使用已被文明人类一般舆论所认为非法的。”
    上面所举的事实无可辩驳地证明，像原子武器这样带有强烈毒素的、惨无人道的大规模屠杀平民的武器，早已为国际法所直接或间接禁止。国际公约中找不到“原子武器”这个名词，并不等于它是合法的。即使退一步说，没有国际公约明文禁止这种武器，但国际习惯法对此仍然是完全可以适用的。纽伦堡和东京的国际军事法庭就是根据这个原则来判决德日战犯的。纽伦堡法庭在判决中称：
    “战争法不仅见之于条约，而且也见之于逐渐获得普遍承认的各国习惯和经法学家通用并经军事法庭实施的一般正义原则。这个法律不是静止的，而是不断修改以适应日新月异的世界之需要的。的确，在许多情形下，条约只不过是为了更准确适用起见把现有的法律原则加以表达和规定而已。”
    一八九九年和一九○七年两次海牙公约也都确认了这基本原则，公约序文中说：
      “在更完善的战争法典未颁布以前，各缔约国认为应当宣布：倘遇有它们所通过的法规所未包括的情形，居民和各交战国由于文明民族间确立的惯例，由于人道的法则，和由于公众良知的驱使，仍受国际法的保护与管辖。”
    纽伦堡判决中有另外一处进一步肯定了海牙公约具有国际习惯法的性质，它说：“海牙公约所规定的规则到一九三九年已被所有文明国家所承认，并被认为是宪章（指法庭宪章）第六条（乙）所称的战争法规与习惯的宣告。”
    此外，海牙国际法院规约第三十八条规定，法院应适用：（丑）“国际习惯，作为通例之证明而经接受为法律者；”（寅）“一般法律原则为文明各国所承认者。”
    由此可知，我们不但可以从国际公约的明文规定中，而且也可以从国际习惯中寻找禁止原子武器的法律根据。如上文所示，这种根据是非常充分的，是铁一般不可动摇的。美国侵略集团的宣传家以为只要矢口抵赖有这种规定，只要咬紧牙关不签订关于禁止原子武器的公约，便可以畅所欲为，而不受法律的制裁。但是，“法网恢恢，疏而不漏”如果美国好战分子竟然无视这些法律，胆敢发动原子战争，那么东条、希特勒、墨索里尼的下场将是他前车之鉴。现在全世界人民反对原子武器的怒吼已经震撼世界，他们的呼声给了这些国际公认的法规以无比的道义和物质力量。这种呼声对那些准备原子战争的人是一个严重的警告，并且使全世界对于原子武器的非法性以及全世界人民对它的极端憎恨不会有丝毫误解。原子战争的发动者要想故做不知，企图逃过人民的正义制裁，那是不可能的。
