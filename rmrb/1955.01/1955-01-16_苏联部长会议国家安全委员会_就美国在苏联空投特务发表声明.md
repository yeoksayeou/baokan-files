Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 15th (TASS): The State Security Committee of the Council of Ministers of the USSR issued the following statement:

In the summer of 1954, an American aircraft that violated the Soviet border air-dropped two American spies over the territory of the Estonian Republic. Some time later, these two spies were discovered by state security agencies in a forest area of ​​the Estonian Republic. During their arrest, one of the spies was shot and killed on the spot for resisting with gunfire, while the other was captured. The captured American spy's identification named him Kallju Kook, and the one killed was named Hans Tumla.

The following items were seized from these two American spies: one automatic rifle loaded with bullets, four pistols, two portable radio receiving and transmitting stations, and codes and ciphers. They carried poison, prepared to be swallowed upon arrest. In addition, the Americans gave them topographic maps, cameras, forged Soviet transit pass forms, military service certificates and certifications, forged seals of certain Soviet agencies, Swedish and Norwegian currency, and 80,000 rubles in Soviet currency.

Interrogation revealed that during the German fascist occupation of the Estonian Republic, Kook and Tumla served in the German army's SS. After the destruction of the German fascists, they fled to Sweden. In Sweden, Kook and Tumla were recruited by American intelligence agencies and sent to the United States to receive training in specialized spy schools, which were specifically designed to train agents and saboteurs for subversive activities against the Soviet Union. Kook and Tumla underwent training at two schools for six months, one located forty kilometers northwest of Washington, near Poolesville, and the other located five or six kilometers from Fairfax (approximately thirty kilometers southwest of Washington). In December 1953, Kook and Tumla were taken to West Germany to continue training at a spy school in the suburbs of Starnberg.

In these schools, under the leadership of American intelligence agency personnel using the aliases Paulson, Baker, Papp, Dick, and Victor, Kook and Tumla learned methods of conducting espionage and sabotage in the Soviet Union, learned shooting, the use of radio equipment and steganography, methods of forging documents, and parachuting.

After completing their training, Kook and Tumla, with their espionage equipment and forged documents, were taken by an American aircraft that took off from Munich Airport to the Soviet border and air-dropped onto Soviet territory.

According to Kook's confession during interrogation, their mission in the Soviet Union was to gather intelligence on airports and other military installations, steal copies of Soviet documents, and recruit new agents for these purposes, as well as to select suitable locations in the territory of the Estonian Republic for American intelligence agencies to air-drop other agents they planned to send into the Soviet Union covertly.

All intelligence gathered by Kook and Tumla was to be sent via radio telegram to the American spy center or written in steganographic letters and mailed to the following addresses provided to them by American intelligence: Werner Dorfmann, 2626 North St. Louis Avenue, Chicago 47, Illinois, USA; Otto Krupmann, 2520 North St. Louis Avenue, Chicago 47, Illinois, USA; Walter Dünnfierld, Wilhelmstrasse 19, Wilzheim (Württemberg), American Zone of Germany; Josef Wick, Erhardinger Strasse 119-1, Munich (8); Andreas Süss, c/o Dr. Georg Keul, Viktor Strasse 32-11; Alm. Siitonen, Koskelantiepuisto 56, Helsinki, Finland; Juko Vojnsa Trel-Katu, Helsinki.

According to the orders of the spy center, Kook and Tumla, after completing their mission, were to return to meet the Americans, and they planned to secretly cross the Norwegian border, where American spies were to meet them.

The interrogation of American spy Kook has concluded. Kook's espionage case has been submitted to a military tribunal for trial.
