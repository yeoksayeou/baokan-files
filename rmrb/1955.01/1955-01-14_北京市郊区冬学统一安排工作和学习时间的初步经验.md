    Preliminary Experiences in Unified Arrangements for Work and Study Time in Winter Schools in the Suburbs of Beijing
    Sun Dejun, Ling Quanfang

    Winter school work in the suburbs of Beijing has been launched in most areas. As of mid-December 1954, more than 35,000 people had enrolled, exceeding the original plan; among them were more than 660 key rural cadres, an average of two per township. In addition, the Municipal Education Bureau has also held off-the-job study classes for rural cadres, drawing 52 rural cadres to participate in the study.

    In the past few years, due to the heavy central work in the rural areas during the winter, the meeting time and the study time could not be properly arranged, resulting in the closure or even collapse of many winter schools. In the winter of 1954, the central work in the rural areas was still heavy, but the winter school work in the suburbs of Beijing was carried out relatively normally, and the situation of persisting in learning was also better. The main reason was that the winter school work and the central work could be well coordinated.

    The methods used by various townships in the suburbs of Beijing to solve the problem of study time for winter schools are effective. For example, Huangshamu Township in the eastern suburbs arranged the study before the meeting; because when the rural areas hold meetings, the masses will not arrive until after 8 pm, and there is still enough time to study before the meeting. Xiaotun Township in Fengtai District stipulates that cultural classes are held on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and political classes are held on Sundays, and meetings are held on the remaining days. Another example is the Communist Party of China's Guoyuan Township Branch in Nanwan District. In order to enable rural cadres to complete the central work and study, it was decided to strengthen the planning of the work and make unified arrangements for the monthly routine meetings of various departments, stipulating that there are 16 days of meeting time each month. The arrangement of the meetings is as follows: those that can be merged are merged, those that can be held at the same time are held at the same time, and those that can be reduced are reduced. For example, the party member study meeting and the party group meeting are merged. If the attendees of the meeting do not overlap (such as the meetings of the culture and education, civil affairs, and mediation committee departments), they will be held on the same day, and the women's federation meetings will be held during the day. This solves the contradiction between study and work and ensures that cadres have ten days of study time each month, studying for one and a half to two hours each day. Recently, two hours of study time from 8 am to 10 am have been added every morning. Their experience has been extended to thirty townships.

    In Guoyuan Township, Nanwan District, the twelve cadres who participated in the study, during the two weeks from November 3 to 15 last year, semi-literate people have completed two units of the course, and illiterate people have completed four lessons of basic characters. The director of the Women's Federation, who did not know a single character, recognized 56 characters and could write them. The cadre group of Nantongshun Township, consisting of five people, studied eight times in ten days from November 23 to December 2, about 13 hours, recognized 120 basic characters, and achieved 70% listening comprehension.

    The reason why winter schools in the suburbs of Beijing can solve the contradiction between work and study in terms of time is inseparable from the attention paid by the Party and government leaders at the district and township levels. Due to a clearer understanding of the guidelines, tasks, and implementation methods determined by the First National Farmers' Spare-time Cultural Education Conference, many district and township-level Party and government leading cadres no longer regard winter school work as dispensable, but as one of the main tasks in winter. The Secretary of the CPC Nanwan District Committee called on township cadres at the enlarged conference of district and township cadres' winter central work to actively lead and participate in winter school studies while actively completing the central work. He also instructed district cadres going to the countryside to mobilize and support rural cadres to study culture. In previous years, when work teams went to the countryside, winter school work was often disrupted. The winter of 1954 was different, and many comrades in the work teams paid great attention to winter schools. When work teams in townships such as Xiaohongmen, Zuo'anmen, and Shicun held mass meetings, they also helped to publicize and organize winter schools. When the work team of Guoyuan Township discussed work with township cadres, they always tried to make time for township cadres to study. The Mafangsi work team in the eastern suburbs took the initiative to convene a winter school work meeting to resolve the contradiction between meeting time and study time. When the Director of the Culture and Education Section of Nanwan District arranged work for the directors of culture and education in various townships, he explained that their main task in winter was to run winter schools well; and they should hold a culture and education meeting every month to report their work to the township Party secretaries and township heads in a timely manner. The People's Congress of Dahongmen Township in Nanwan District also included winter school work as one of the agenda items. When Paifang Township collected public grain, it needed to transfer some winter school teachers who could write and calculate to help. In the past, the township leaders would only care about transferring winter school teachers and would not pay attention to winter schools. This time, they consulted with the Culture and Education Committee and the winter school department in advance. After the teachers were transferred, the lessons were taught by the counselors (almost every class in winter schools in Nanwan District has a teacher and a counselor). In this way, it not only cooperated with the central work but also did not affect the study.

    The above situation shows that the contradiction between winter school work and the central work in rural areas in terms of time is not unsolvable. As long as the Party and government leaders at the district and township levels pay attention and support it, take concrete measures, and arrange the time reasonably, winter school work and central work can be well integrated.

    北京市郊区冬学统一安排工作和学习时间的初步经验
    孙德俊　凌泉方
    北京市郊区的冬学工作，已在绝大部分地区开展起来。截至一九五四年十二月中旬止，已有三万五千余人入学，超过了原计划数；其中乡村主要干部有六百六十余人，平均每乡两人。此外，市教育局还举办了乡村干部离职学习班，抽调五十二名乡村干部参加学习。
    在过去几年中，往往由于农村冬季中心工作繁重，会议时间和学习时间不能得到妥善的安排，以致不少的冬学停课甚至垮台。一九五四年冬农村的中心工作仍然是繁重的，而北京市郊区的冬学工作开展得却比较正常，坚持学习的情况也较好，其主要原因是冬学工作和中心工作能够配合得好。
    北京市郊区各乡解决冬学学习时间问题的办法是有效的。例如：东郊区黄杉木店乡把学习安排在会议以前；因为乡村开会，总要在晚上八点以后群众才能到齐，会前尚有足够的时间可以学习。丰台区小屯乡则规定星期一、三、五上文化课，星期日上政治课，其余的日子开会。又如中共南苑区果园乡支部为了使乡村干部既能完成中心工作，又能学习，决定加强工作的计划性，把各部门的每月例会作了统一安排，规定每月有十六天是开会时间。会议的安排办法是：能合并的合并，能同时开的同时开，能减少的减少。例如党员学习会和党小组会合并，如果会议的出席人员不重复（如文教、民政、调解委员会等部门的会议），就在同日召开，妇联的会议在白天开。这样就解决了学习和工作的矛盾，保证干部每月有十天的学习时间，每天学一小时半到两小时。最近又增加了每天早晨八点到十点的两小时学习时间。他们这个经验，已经推广到三十个乡了。
    南苑区果园乡参加学习的十二名干部，在去年十一月三日到十五日的两周内，半文盲已学完两个单元的课程，文盲已学完四课基础字，原来一字不识的妇联主任认识了五十六个字，而且会写。南通顺乡干部组五人，在十一月二十三日到十二月二日的十天中，学习了八次，约十三小时，认识了一百二十个基础字，听写能力达百分之七十。
    北京市郊区冬学所以能够比较合理地解决了工作和学习之间在时间上的矛盾，是和区、乡党政领导方面的重视分不开的。由于对第一次全国农民业余文化教育会议所确定的方针任务和实施办法有了较明确的认识，不少区、乡级党政领导干部对冬学工作不再看作是可有可无的事了，而是把它当作冬季主要工作之一。中共南苑区委会书记曾在区乡干部冬季中心工作扩大会议上，号召乡干部在积极完成中心工作的同时，还要积极领导冬学和参加冬学学习。并指示下乡的区干部要动员、支持乡村干部学习文化。往年工作组一下乡，冬学工作常常会被打乱。一九五四年的冬季不同了，不少工作组的同志们对冬学很注意。小红门、左安门、时村等乡的工作组在召开群众大会的时候，也帮助进行冬学的宣传和组织工作。果园乡工作组和乡干部研究工作的时候，总要设法把乡干部的学习时间让出来。东郊区马房寺工作组曾经主动地召开了冬学工作会议，解决开会时间和学习时间的矛盾。南苑区文教科长给各乡文教主任布置工作的时候，说明他们冬季的主要工作就是办好冬学；并且要他们每月开一次文教会议，及时向乡支书和乡长汇报工作。南苑区大红门乡人民代表大会，也把冬学工作列为议程之一。牌坊乡在收公粮的时候，需要抽调一些能写会算的冬学教师帮忙。若在往年，乡领导方面就只顾到抽派冬学教师，不注意到冬学了。这一次却事先同文教委员会和冬学校部研究了一下，教师抽调后，功课由辅导员代上（南苑区冬学差不多每一班都有一名教师和一名辅导员）。这样，既配合了中心工作，又不影响学习。
    以上情况说明，冬学工作和农村冬季的中心工作在时间上的矛盾，并不是不能解决的。只要区、乡党政领导方面重视和支持，采取具体措施，合理地安排时间，冬学工作和中心工作是能够很好地结合进行的。
