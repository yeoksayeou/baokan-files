Zhengzhou Youth Workers Launch Full Attendance Competition

    Zhengzhou's youth workers have launched a full attendance competition before and after the Spring Festival. Zhengzhou's industrial construction is rapidly expanding, and this year's construction scale is even larger than last year. This situation has inspired the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers.
    On December 23rd of last year, workers from nineteen advanced youth classes and groups in Zhengzhou, in order to greet new tasks, jointly issued a challenge to all employees in the city, guaranteeing full attendance before and after the Spring Festival. This challenge was published in the Zhengzhou Daily and received enthusiastic responses from employees in various factories. Many groups of workers responded to the challenge.
    The full attendance competition has achieved good results. On the first day of work this year, many groups of workers had full attendance and arrived early. The youth group of the Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory has completed its January production plan five days ahead of schedule based on actual working days. Young men and women workers at the state-owned Zhengzhou First and Second Cotton Textile Factories have included non-absenteeism before and after the Spring Festival in their group guarantee conditions, and as soon as the Spring Festival is over, they will pack up their equipment and start production.

    郑州青年工人掀起全勤竞赛
    郑州市的青年工人掀起春节前后的全勤竞赛。郑州市的工业建设在迅速展开，今年的建设规模比去年更大。这种情景激励着广大工人的劳动热情。
    去年十二月二十三日，郑州十九个先进的青年班、组的工人，为迎接新任务联合向全市职工发起挑战，保证春节前后全部出勤。这份挑战书在郑州日报上发表后，得到各工厂职工的热烈响应，许多小组工人纷纷应战。
    全勤竞赛收到了良好的效果。今年开工第一天，许多小组工人全部出勤，并提早上班。郑州纺织机械厂青年组，已按实际工作日提前五天完成了一月份的生产计划。国营郑州第一和第二棉纺织厂的青年男女工人们，把春节前后不缺勤订进小组保证条件，只要春节一过，他（她）们就收拾好车子开工生产。（本报集体通讯员郑州日报编辑部）
