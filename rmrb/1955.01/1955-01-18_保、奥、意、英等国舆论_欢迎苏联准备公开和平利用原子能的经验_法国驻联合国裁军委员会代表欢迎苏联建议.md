Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, January 17th: The "Fatherland Front" newspaper, commenting on the TASS statement regarding the Soviet government's preparedness to share its experience in the peaceful uses of atomic energy with other countries, wrote: This magnificent proposal is undoubtedly greatly different from an ordinary technical suggestion; it is an action of great significance, and it will surely vigorously promote the development of international cooperation.

This is a new example of the undeniable sincerity consistently demonstrated by the Soviet Union in leading the struggle for peace and international friendship, in easing international tensions.

The "Fatherland Front" continued, saying that the millions of people around the world who hail the Soviet government's proposal cannot help but compare this proposal with the recent resolution passed at the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting authorizing Atlantic generals to use atomic weapons at any time they deem necessary.

Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, January 17th: Austrian democratic public opinion warmly welcomes the TASS statement that the Soviet government is willing to submit a report on the Soviet Union's first atomic energy industrial power station and its operations to the international conference on the peaceful uses of atomic energy to be convened in 1955, as decided by the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly.

The "Austrian People's Voice" wrote: The Soviet Union's first atomic energy industrial power station began generating electricity in 1954 and has since supplied electricity to industry and agriculture in nearby areas. Although the Soviet Union possesses atomic and hydrogen weapons, it resolutely and consistently advocates a complete ban on the use of atomic energy for military purposes and advocates effective international supervision of such a ban. The newspaper emphasized that the TASS statement shows that the Soviet Union has taken practical steps to make its achievements in the peaceful use of atomic energy available to all countries. This practical contribution by the Soviet Union to international peace cooperation is of great significance. It shows that the enormous possibilities of peaceful coexistence between countries with different political systems have been presented to the people of all countries, including the Austrian people.

Xinhua News Agency, Rome, January 17th: Italian newspapers widely comment on the TASS statement that the Soviet government is willing to share its scientific and technical experience in the peaceful uses of atomic energy with other countries.

"Avanti!" published an article on its front page stating: "This step taken by the Soviet Union is part of a policy aimed at establishing the principle of peaceful coexistence and is a valuable contribution to the cause of creating an atmosphere of international cooperation... Concluding an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy could become part of the broader issue of international cooperation and a prerequisite for a favorable resolution of the disarmament issue."

"Unità" published an article by its Moscow correspondent that extensively commented on the statement issued by TASS.

"Il Messaggero" published the TASS statement with a large headline.

Many newspapers supporting the Italian coalition government also published the TASS statement.

Xinhua News Agency, London, January 17th: "The Daily Mail" published an editorial welcoming the Soviet government's proposal to share the working experience of its atomic energy power station with other countries. The newspaper believes that this proposal is "good news".

The editorial wrote: "Britain should also announce its willingness to contribute its experience to mankind."

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 16th: After the news was released that the Soviet Union was prepared to hand over the scientific and technological experience of its first atomic energy power station to the United Nations, the French representative to the United Nations Disarmament Commission, Jules Moch, made a statement to Agence France-Presse regarding this news. Moch said that the news was a natural result of the attitude adopted by the Soviet Union during the very important debate on the peaceful use of atomic energy at the United Nations General Assembly last December. The Soviet proposal is unprecedented. Moch said that, in any case, the Soviet action is to be welcomed.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 16th: US State Department spokesman, Mr. Sultam said that the State Department is currently unwilling to comment on a TASS statement. The gist of the TASS statement is that, recognizing the great importance of using atomic energy for peaceful purposes, and in order to promote international cooperation in this regard, the Soviet government is prepared to disseminate the relevant scientific and technological experience accumulated by the Soviet Union in establishing the first atomic energy industrial power station.

    保、奥、意、英等国舆论
    欢迎苏联准备公开和平利用原子能的经验
    法国驻联合国裁军委员会代表欢迎苏联建议
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社索非亚十七日讯：“祖国阵线报”评论塔斯社关于苏联政府准备向其他国家公开它在原子能和平用途方面的经验的声明时写道：这个气魄雄伟的建议无疑地是同一个普通的技术建议大大不同的；这是一个具有重大意义的行动，它一定会猛烈推动国际合作的发展。
    这是苏联在领导为争取和平和国际友谊的斗争中所一贯表现的对于缓和国际紧张局势的无可怀疑的诚意的一个新的例证。
      “祖国阵线报”接着说，全世界向苏联政府建议欢呼的千千万万的人民，不能不把这个建议同最近在侵略性北大西洋公约组织理事会会议上所通过的授权大西洋将军们在他们认为必要时可以随时使用原子武器的决议相对比。
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社维也纳十七日讯：奥地利民主舆论极为欢迎塔斯社发表的关于苏联政府愿意向根据联合国大会第九届会议的决定在一九五五年内召开的讨论和平利用原子能国际会议提出关于苏联第一个原子能工业电力站及其工作情况的报告的声明。
    “奥地利人民之声报”写道：苏联第一个原子能工业电力站在一九五四年开始发电，并且从那时起已经为附近地区的工业和农业输送电力。苏联虽然握有原子武器和氢武器，却坚决地、始终不渝地主张完全禁止原子能用于军事目的，并且主张对这种禁止加以有效的国际监督。报纸着重指出，塔斯社的声明表明，苏联已经采取实际步骤，把它在和平利用原子能方面所获得的成就交给所有国家利用。苏联对国际和平合作的这种实际的贡献是具有极大的意义的。它表明在包括奥地利人民在内的各国人民面前已经提出了政治制度不同的国家和平共处的巨大可能性。
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社罗马十七日讯：意大利报纸广泛评论塔斯社发表的关于苏联政府愿意向其他国家公开它在原子能和平用途方面的科学及技术经验的声明。
    “前进报”在第一版上发表文章说：“苏联所采取的这个步骤，是目的在于确立和平共处的原则的政策的一部分，并且是对于创造国际合作气氛的事业的有价值的贡献……就和平利用原子能缔结一项协议可能成为国际合作的更广泛的问题的一部分，并且是有利地解决裁军问题的一个先决条件。”
    “团结报”登载了它的驻莫斯科记者广泛评论塔斯社所发表的声明的一篇文章。
    “国家报”以大字标题刊载了塔斯社的声明。
    支持意大利联合政府的许多报纸也登载了塔斯社的声明。
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社伦敦十七日讯：“雷诺新闻”发表社论，欢迎苏联政府提出的向其他国家公开原子能电力站工作经验的建议。这家报纸认为，这个建议是“好消息”。
    社论写道：“英国也应当宣布它愿意把它的经验贡献给人类”。
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十六日讯：苏联准备把它的第一个原子能电力站的科学技术经验交给联合国的消息发表后，法国驻联合国裁军委员会代表儒勒·莫克就这个消息向法新社发表了谈话。莫克说，这个消息是苏联在去年十二月联合国大会关于和平利用原子能的这一十分重要的辩论中所采取的态度的必然结果。苏联的这个建议是史无前例的。莫克说，无论如何，苏联的这种行动是值得欢迎的。
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社华盛顿十六日讯：美国国务院发言人苏丹姆说，国务院目前不愿就塔斯社的一项声明发表意见。塔斯社的这项声明大意说，苏联政府由于认识到把原子能用于和平目的的极大重要性，并且为了促进这方面的国际合作，准备传播苏联在建立第一个原子能工业电力站方面积累起来的有关的科学技术经验。
