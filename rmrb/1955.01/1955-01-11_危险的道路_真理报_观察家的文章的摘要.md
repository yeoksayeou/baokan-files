Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th: According to TASS, "Pravda" published an article by "Observer" on the 8th, entitled "A Dangerous Road." The article stated:

    No sooner had Mendès France secured formal approval of the Paris Accords by the French National Assembly than he was presented with another demand from across the Atlantic: France must ratify the Manila Treaty, which lays the foundation for the aggressive "Southeast Asia" alliance, before February 23rd.

    The ruling groups in the United States have decided to convene a meeting of the signatory countries of the Manila Treaty in Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, on February 23rd. Dulles is demanding that this group take action. To achieve this goal, a Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Council meeting must be held to establish a "mobile strike force" and organize a "permanent headquarters."

    But before a Council meeting can be held, the Council must first be established! And the Council cannot be established because no country has yet ratified the Manila Treaty. Therefore, Washington demands that at least five countries immediately ratify the Manila Treaty. Paris has also received such a request.

    But how can such an unpopular treaty, which the American imperialists intend to use to squeeze out their partners and ensure their own domination in Southeast Asia, be approved?

    Even the French bourgeoisie, which is being squeezed out of Indochina by American monopoly capital, is gradually realizing the true nature of the treaty. Is it worth risking fate again by submitting the question of ratifying the Manila Treaty to the parliament? What if the parliament votes no confidence this time? Can Washington's new pressure and guarantees save the day? These are the questions facing the French government today.

    However, the French government has decided to try to get the Manila Treaty ratified, but—without parliamentary discussion. "Le Monde" reported on January 5th that the French cabinet had decided to: "Suggest to the President of the Republic to proceed with the ratification of this (Manila) Treaty." The newspaper pointed out that this wording itself is surprising. "Le Monde" said that usually, it is "requested" of the President of the Republic to ratify this or that treaty, rather than "suggesting" that he do so. But even leaving aside the issue of wording, some political figures are very surprised by the fact that this treaty, which so clearly determines France's policy direction in Southeast Asia—a region with a particularly complex situation in the world—will not be submitted to parliament for approval.

    The legal advisors of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs insist that the Manila Treaty will not bring any "financial obligations" to France, attempting to prove that the French government's decision is "correct."

    But how can one reconcile this statement with the news coming from Washington? News from Washington says that all participants in the Manila Treaty must provide naval and air forces to assist the American fleet and air force operating in Southeast Asia. And how can one reconcile this statement with the fact that Washington already believes that the French armed forces in Indochina will be subordinate to these "joint" armed forces in accordance with the Manila Treaty? Wouldn't the expenses of these forces be a considerable sum for France?

    Future developments will show whether the Mendès France government will bypass parliament and drag France into another aggressive treaty against the will of the French people. But at least one thing is clear: by yielding step by step to American orders, the French government is dragging France onto a dangerous road.

    危险的道路
    ——“真理报”观察家的文章的摘要
    【新华社九日讯】　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”八日登载了“观察家”的一篇文章，题目是“危险的道路”。文章写道：
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯刚刚使得法国国民议会正式批准了巴黎协定，大洋彼岸就向他提出了另外一个要求：在二月二十三日以前，法国必须批准为侵略性的“东南亚”联盟奠定基础的马尼拉条约。
    美国统治集团决定二月二十三日在泰国首都曼谷召开马尼拉条约签字国的会议。杜勒斯所要求的是这个集团行动起来。为了达到这个目的，就必须举行这样一个东南亚条约组织理事会会议来建立一支“机动的突击部队”并组织一个“常设司令部”。
    但是在能够举行一次理事会会议以前，首先必须把这个理事会建立起来！而这个理事会又不能建立起来，因为还没有一个国家批准马尼拉条约。因此华盛顿要求至少要有五个国家立即批准马尼拉条约。巴黎也接到了这样的要求。
    但是怎样才可以使得美帝国主义者打算用来排挤他们的伙计以保证他们自己在东南亚的统治地位的这样一个不受欢迎的条约获得批准呢？
    甚至正在被美国垄断资本从印度支那排挤出来的法国资产阶级也逐渐明白了条约的这种真正性质。难道值得再度以命运来冒险，向议会提出批准马尼拉条约的问题么？如果这一回议会投不信任票那又怎么办呢？华盛顿的新压力和保证能救得了命吗？这些都是法国政府今天所面临的问题。
    然而，法国政府下定了决心试试看，使马尼拉条约得到批准，不过——不经议会讨论而批准。“世界报”一月五日报道说，法国内阁决定：“建议共和国总统着手批准这个（马尼拉）条约”。报纸指出，这种措辞本身就是令人惊讶的。“世界报”说，通常，都是“请求”共和国总统来批准这个或那个条约，而不是“建议”他这样做。但是，即使把措辞的问题撇开不谈，某些政界人士对这一事实感到非常惊讶：这个这样清楚地决定法国在东南亚——这是世界上局势特别复杂的一个地区——的政策方向的条约竟然会不提交议会批准。
    法国外交部的法律顾问们硬说马尼拉条约不会给法国带来任何“财政义务”，企图借此证明法国政府作出这种决定是“正确”的。
    但是，人们怎么能使这种说法同来自华盛顿的消息相调和呢？华盛顿的消息说，马尼拉条约的一切参加者都得提供海军和空军来援助在东南亚活动的美国舰队和空军。而且人们又怎么能使这种说法同下面的事实相调和呢：华盛顿已经在认为，法国在印度支那的武装部队将按照马尼拉条约隶属于这些“联合”武装部队之内，难道对法国来说，这些部队的费用不是一笔相当可观的款项吗？
    将来的发展将会表明孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府是否会绕过议会和违背法国人民的意志而把法国拖入另一个侵略性条约之内。但是至少有一件事情是很明显的：由于一步一步地向美国的命令让步，法国政府正在把法国拖上一条危险的道路。
