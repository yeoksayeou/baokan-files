This increased production of cotton cloth can provide 34 million people with a set of clothing each.

Among the new printing and dyeing varieties, there was a significant increase in varieties suitable for farmers' needs.

The total output value plans of all professional bureaus were overfulfilled, except for the Salt Affairs Administration Bureau, which failed to complete its plan due to excessive rainfall in the sea salt areas.
