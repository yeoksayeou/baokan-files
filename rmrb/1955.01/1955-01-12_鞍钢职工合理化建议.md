    Anshan Iron and Steel Company workers submitted over ten thousand rationalization proposals last year. The three thousand plus proposals that have been adopted and put into production alone can create over 70 billion yuan of net profit for the country. These implemented rationalization proposals have played a significant role in improving production, reducing costs, and improving the working environment. The successful creation of mechanical equipment for cleaning coke oven doors in the Chemical Plant freed workers from the harsh working environment and improved product quality. The mechanization of the pellet outlet in the Ore Dressing Plant saved 28 workers per shift and greatly improved labor productivity. The improvement of the billet turning claws on the primary rolling mill in the primary rolling plant increased the turning speed of billets and can create more than 10 billion yuan of wealth for the country each year. The implementation of the rationalization proposal to reduce Tangma iron in the Iron Smelting Plant can reduce losses by 500 to 600 tons of iron per month, saving the country more than 8 billion yuan of wealth per year.

    In addition to strengthening the organization and leadership of rationalization proposal work and publishing two rationalization proposal topics and reward topics last year, the company also initially studied advanced Soviet experience, promulgated the 1954 rationalization proposal target of creating 100 billion yuan of net profit for the country, and allocated it to various units proportionally. By the end of last year, more than ten units, including the Chemical Plant, Power Plant, and Cast Iron Pipe Plant, had completed their planned targets.

    鞍钢职工合理化建议
    鞍山钢铁公司职工在去年提出了一万数千件合理化建议，仅已被采纳投入生产的三千多件就可给国家创造七百多亿元纯利润财富。这些已实现的合理化建议，对提高生产、降低成本、改善劳动环境起了巨大作用。化工总厂清扫炼焦炉门的机械设备创造成功后，使工人脱离了恶劣的劳动环境，而且提高了产品质量。选矿厂团矿出炉口改为机械化后，三班节省二十八个工，大大提高了劳动生产率。初轧厂初轧机翻钢爪的改进，提高了翻钢速度，每年可给国家创造十多亿元的财富。炼铁厂减少唐马铁的合理化建议实现后，每月可少损失五百到六百吨铁，一年可给国家节约八十多亿元的财富。
    公司在去年除加强合理化建议工作的组织领导，公布了两次合理化建议课题和悬赏课题以外，还初步学习了苏联先进经验，颁布了一九五四年给国家创造一千亿元纯利润财富的合理化建议指标，按照比例分配到各单位。到去年末有化工总厂、发电厂、铸管厂等十多个单位完成了计划指标。
