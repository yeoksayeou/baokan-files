The Vietnam "People's Daily" published a commentary saying:
    China's Determination to Liberate Taiwan is as Solid as Steel
Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 29th: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a commentary on January 28th entitled: "American Imperialism Cannot Stop the Chinese People from Liberating Taiwan."

    The commentary said that faced with the Chinese people's active preparations to liberate Taiwan, especially after the Chinese People's Liberation Army liberated Yijiangshan Island, American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek felt anxious and uneasy. American imperialism is playing a "ceasefire" trick, which is just a means for it to legitimize its attempt to separate Taiwan from China. American imperialism also falsely claims that the Chinese people's preparations to liberate Taiwan have made the situation in the Far East tense. However, Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the liberation of Taiwan is China's internal affair, and the United Nations or any country has no right to interfere.

    The commentary said that everyone understands that it is American imperialism itself that is creating the tense situation in the Far East. It once provoked the war of aggression against Korea and instigated French warmongers to prolong the war in Indochina. After the restoration of peace in Korea and Indochina, it pieced together a Southeast Asian military aggression bloc and prepared to hold a Bangkok conference to further undermine the Geneva Accords and threaten the peace and security of Southeast Asian countries. The recent actions taken by American imperialism on the Taiwan issue have made the situation even more tense. Recently, American warships sailed to Dachen Island, and the U.S. House of Representatives authorized Eisenhower to use troops to "protect" Taiwan and other islands. These actions nakedly expose that American imperialism has no intention of easing the tense situation in the Far East; on the contrary, all actions of American imperialism are for the purpose of provocation.

    The commentary said that the Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan is as solid as steel. History proves that anyone who attempts to invade China or interfere in China's internal affairs will be defeated by the Chinese people.

    The commentary also said that liberating Taiwan is a just action of the Chinese people, an action to ensure the free conduct of international trade on China's seas, and an action to consolidate peace and ease the tension in the Far East.

    The commentary concluded by saying that the people of all countries are concerned about their own sovereignty, and all people who have the sincerity to ease the tension in the Far East warmly support the Chinese people's cause of liberating Taiwan.

The "Hungarian National Daily" published an article saying:
    The United States Uses "Ceasefire" to Deceive International Public Opinion
Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 29th: Budapest News: The "Hungarian National Daily" published an article on January 28th saying that the purpose of Eisenhower's "ceasefire" proposal is to deceive international public opinion and make people believe that he seems willing to ease the tension in the Far East. The article pointed out that this proposal rudely interferes in China's internal affairs and, like Eisenhower's special message, signifies the continuous increase of American war provocations. The article emphasized that the Chinese people, together with the peace-loving people of the world, resolutely oppose all conspiracies aimed at undermining peace in the Far East.

    The Hungarian "People's Voice" published an editorial on January 27th saying that Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the U.S. government's interference in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan expresses the will of the 600 million Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world. Eisenhower's special message has made the situation in Europe and Asia more tense. Anyone who forgets the strength of the People's Republic of China in defending peace in the Far East will not be surprised to be defeated by the test of history in Taiwan.

The Bulgarian "Workers' Cause" published an article saying:
    The United States Wants to Use "Ceasefire" to Legitimate the Occupation of Taiwan
Xinhua News Agency, January 29th: Sofia News: The Bulgarian "Workers' Cause" published an article by Nikolov on January 28th, commenting on the statement by our Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on the U.S. government's interference in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan. The article said that the United States wants to quell world public opinion's indignation at its obstruction of the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan, and attempts to use the conspiracy of a so-called UN-mediated ceasefire. This is nothing more than forcing the Chinese people to recognize the U.S. occupation of Taiwan as "legal." The article pointed out that the United States describes the just act of the Chinese people liberating Taiwan, an inseparable part of Chinese territory, as a threat to peace, deepening the tension in Asia and the Far East. In fact, it is not difficult to understand that the only party responsible for the tense situation in this region of the world is the United States of America, not the People's Republic of China. The United States occupies Taiwan, supports and protects the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and strengthens its continuous sabotage actions against the People's Republic of China. The U.S.-Chiang treaty further increases the tension in the Far East and is a serious threat to peace.

    The article said: "The peace-loving people of Asia and the world are watching with great indignation the new actions taken by American imperialism, which seriously threaten peace. No sabotage activities and peace-disguised gestures can relax the vigilance of the people. The great Chinese people will receive the sympathy and support of the peace-loving people in their just struggle."

Indian Newspapers Published Comments Saying:
    The Serious Situation Can Be Eliminated if the United States Withdraws from Taiwan
Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 29th: Indian newspapers attach importance to the situation caused by the United States' further threat to control Taiwan through a series of conspiracies and military actions.

    The "National Herald" published an editorial commenting on the so-called ceasefire proposal, saying: "This plan is unacceptable to the government of the People's Republic of China."

    The editorial pointed out that the easing of tensions in the Far East is even more urgent due to the serious situation caused by new developments. It said: "This serious situation is not caused by Beijing's attempt to liberate Taiwan, but by the obligations undertaken by the United States in this region. What is strange and incomprehensible to Beijing is: why does the United States think that Taiwan's importance to the United States' security is greater than its importance to China's security? If the United States withdraws from Taiwan and allows the Kuomintang to be quickly eliminated, the serious situation can be eliminated." The editorial said: "Chiang Kai-shek has his current position because of the support of the United States."

    The "Hindustan Standard" published an editorial on January 27th on Eisenhower's threat to use U.S. armed forces to control Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, saying: "This seems to have increased the danger of war in the Far East." The editorial wrote: "This is a very bad and dangerous situation." "President Eisenhower's request to take action directly or through the United Nations in this eventful region does not seem to ease the situation in any way."

    The "Amrita Bazar Patrika" published an article entitled "Provocation" saying that it now appears that neither Eisenhower nor Dulles sincerely hopes for a ceasefire.

Indonesian Public Opinion Pointed Out:
    Taiwan is the Territory of the People's Republic of China
According to Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 29th: According to Antara News Agency, Mois, chairman of the newly elected Indonesian parliament's foreign affairs subcommittee, said on the 28th that as long as Taiwan and the nearby islands have not been liberated from the hands of the Kuomintang by the People's Republic of China, these islands will constantly pose a danger to the People's Republic of China. Mois said that Taiwan must be restored as the territory of the People's Republic of China, because Taiwan belongs to China, and the government currently recognized by the Chinese people is the government of the People's Republic of China.

    The Jakarta Daily "National Vanguard" said on the 28th that the United States' use of armed forces to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries is an open act of aggression. The newspaper called on all countries that disagree with the United States taking this attitude in the West or the East to do their best to find ways to avoid this new war.

    The "Indonesian Observer" continued to call on the United States to face reality on the 28th. The newspaper said that solving the Taiwan issue should not be difficult for the United States, as long as it recognizes the reality that the Chinese People's Government is the sole government representing China. The newspaper once again called for the restoration of the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.

United Nations Personnel Told Reporters:
    The United States Has No Reason to Interfere in China's Internal Affairs
Xinhua News Agency, January 29th: TASS News Agency, New York, January 29th: Reporters outside the United Nations meeting rooms are enthusiastically discussing the U.S. House of Representatives' resolution to grant President Eisenhower the power to use U.S. armed forces in the Taiwan and Penghu areas of China. United Nations agency staff, when talking to reporters, did not hide their belief that this resolution would only further strain international relations. People believe that the United States has no legal, political, or other reasons to interfere in China's internal affairs. Representatives of some delegations that usually support U.S. policy said that they believe the purpose of this step by the United States is to launch a new war.

    A representative stationed at the United Nations pointed out that the United States' interference in China's internal affairs is excessive, even to the point of actually threatening with war. He believes that the U.S. arguments are weak, and the U.S. ambition for Taiwan, which supposedly plays a major role in U.S. defense, is unreasonable and absurd. Thus, this representative sarcastically said that the U.S. ruling group needs Taiwan to defend their homeland thousands of kilometers away from Taiwan, while the People's Republic of China, as the legitimate owner of this island, does not seem to need this island to defend Chinese territory so close to it.

### 谴责美国战争挑衅和“停火”阴谋

    谴责美国战争挑衅和“停火”阴谋
    越南“人民报”发表评论说：
    中国人民解放台湾的决心坚如钢铁
    【新华社河内二十九日电】　越南“人民报”二十八日刊载一篇评论，题目是：“美帝国主义阻挡不了中国人民解放台湾”。
    评论说，面临着中国人民积极准备解放台湾的行动，尤其在中国人民解放军解放了一江山岛以后，美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石感到焦虑不安。美帝国主义玩弄“停火”诡计，这只是它企图使台湾从中国分离出去的行为合法化的一种手段。美帝国主义又胡诌说，中国人民准备解放台湾的行动使远东局势紧张起来。但台湾是中国的领土，解放台湾是中国的内政，联合国或无论哪一个国家都无权干预。
    评论说，谁都明白，制造远东紧张局势的正是美帝国主义自己。它曾经挑起侵朝战争并怂恿法国好战分子延长印度支那战争。在朝鲜和印度支那的和平恢复后，它又拼凑了东南亚军事侵略集团，并且准备召开曼谷会议以进一步破坏日内瓦协议，威胁东南亚各国的和平与安全。美帝国主义最近对于台湾问题所采取的行动使局势更加紧张起来。最近美国军舰开向大陈岛，美国众议院准许艾森豪威尔用军队“保护”台湾和其他岛屿。这些行动都赤裸裸地暴露了美帝国主义是无意使远东紧张局势趋于和缓的；相反地，美帝国主义的一切行动都是为了达到挑战的目的。
    评论说，中国人民解放台湾的决心坚如钢铁。历史证明，任何企图侵略中国、干预中国内政的人，都被中国人民击溃了。
    评论又说，解放台湾是中国人民的正义行动，是保障国际贸易能在中国的海面上自由进行，是巩固和平与缓和远东紧张局势的行动。
    评论最后说，各国人民都是关切自己的主权的，一切具有缓和远东紧张局势的诚意的人们都热烈支持中国人民解放台湾的事业。
    “匈牙利民族报”发表文章说：
    美国利用“停火”欺骗国际舆论
    【新华社布拉格二十九日电】　布达佩斯消息：“匈牙利民族报”二十八日刊载文章说，艾森豪威尔的“停火”建议的目的，是要欺骗国际舆论，使人相信他好像是愿意缓和远东紧张局势似的。文章指出，这个建议粗暴地干涉了中国内政，与艾森豪威尔的特别咨文同样意味着美国战争挑衅的不断增强。文章强调说：中国人民与世界爱好和平的人们一起，坚决反对旨在破坏远东和平的一切阴谋诡计。
    匈牙利“人民之声报”二十七日发表社论说：周恩来总理关于美国政府干涉中国人民解放台湾的声明，表达了六亿中国人民及全世界爱好和平人民的意志。艾森豪威尔的特别咨文使欧洲和亚洲局势更加紧张。谁如果忘记中华人民共和国保卫远东和平的力量，那么他将并不意外地在台湾遭到历史考验的失败。
    保“工人事业报”发表文章说：
    美国想借“停火”使占领台湾合法化
    【新华社二十九日讯】　索非亚消息：保加利亚  “工人事业报”二十八日发表尼科洛夫的文章，评论我周恩来总理兼外交部长关于美国政府干涉中国人民解放台湾的声明。文章说，美国想平息世界舆论对它阻挠中国人民解放台湾的义愤，企图利用所谓联合国斡旋停火的阴谋。这不过是强迫中国人民承认美国占领台湾为“合法”。文章指出，美国把中国人民解放中国领土的不可分割的一部分——台湾的正义行为，说成是对和平的威胁，加深了亚洲和远东的紧张局势。其实不难了解，造成世界这一地区紧张局势的唯一负责者是美利坚合众国而不是中华人民共和国。美国占领着台湾，支持和保护着蒋介石集团，加强它的不间断的反对中华人民共和国的破坏行动。美蒋条约更增加了远东的紧张，它是对和平的严重威胁。
    文章说：“亚洲及全世界爱好和平的人民怀着极大的义愤注视着美帝国主义最近所采取的对和平有严重威胁的新行动。任何破坏活动和伪装和平的姿态都不能松懈人民的警惕。伟大的中国人民在他们正义的斗争中将得到爱好和平的人民的同情和支持。”
    印度报纸发表评论说：
    美国如撤离台湾严重局势就可消除
    【新华社新德里二十九日电】　印度报纸重视由于美国进一步威胁要通过一系列的阴谋和军事行动控制台湾所造成的局势。
    “国民先驱报”发表社论，评述所谓停火的建议说：“对中华人民共和国政府来说，这个方案是不能接受的。”
    社论指出，由于新的发展造成的严重局势，远东紧张局势的缓和更加迫切了，它说：“这种严重局势不是由于北京解放台湾的企图引起的，而是美国在这个地区承担的义务引起的。令人奇怪的和使北京不能理解的是：为什么美国认为台湾对美国的安全的重要性，比它对中国的安全的重要性更大呢？如果美国撤离台湾，让国民党迅速被消灭，严重的局势就可以消除。”社论说：“蒋介石之所以有现在的地位，是由于美国的支持”。
    “印度斯坦旗报”二十七日就艾森豪威尔威胁要使用美国武装部队控制台湾和澎湖一事发表社论说：“这似乎是增加了远东的战争危险。”社论写道：“这是非常不好和危险的局势。”“艾森豪威尔总统要求直接或通过联合国在这个多事的地区采取行动一事，看来并不会使局势有任何缓和。”
    “甘露市场报”以“挑衅”为题发表文章说，现在看来艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯都不是诚意地希望停火。
    印度尼西亚舆论指出：
    台湾是中华人民共和国的领土
    据新华社雅加达二十九日电：据安塔拉通讯社消息，印度尼西亚新选出的国会外交小组委员会主席莫伊斯在二十八日说，只要台湾和附近的各岛屿还没有被中华人民共和国从国民党的手里解放，这些岛屿就会使中华人民共和国经常遭受着危险。莫伊斯说，台湾必须恢复为中华人民共和国的领土，因为台湾是中国所有的，而在目前为中国人民所承认的政府就是中华人民共和国政府。
    雅加达日报“民族先锋报”二十八日说，美国使用武装部队干涉其他国家的内政是公开采取侵略行动。报纸要求凡是不同意美国无论在西方或东方采取这种态度的一切国家都应该竭力找出办法来避免这场新的战争。
    “印度尼西亚观察家报”在二十八日继续要求美国面对现实。这家报纸说，要解决台湾问题对于美国来说不应该是很困难的事，只要它承认这样的现实：中国人民政府是代表中国的唯一政府。这家报纸再度要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位。
    联合国人员对新闻记者表示：
    美国没有任何理由干涉中国内政
    【新华社二十九日讯】　塔斯社纽约二十九日讯：联合国会议室外的记者们热烈讨论美国众议院关于授予艾森豪威尔总统以在中国的台湾和澎湖地区使用美国武装部队的权力的决议。联合国机构工作人员在和记者谈话时都不掩饰地表示，这个决议只能使国际关系进一步紧张。人们认为，美国没有任何法律上的、政治上的或其他的理由来干涉中国的内政。某些通常支持美国的政策的代表团的代表说，他们认为美国的这个步骤的目的是要发动新战争。
    一个驻联合国代表指出，美国干涉中国内政是太过分了，竟至实际上用战争来进行威胁。他认为美国的论据是无力的，而美国对据说在美国的防御中起重大作用的台湾的野心是没有理由的和荒谬的。于是这位代表讽刺说，美国统治集团需要台湾来保卫他们的距台湾好几千公里的祖国，而作为这个岛屿的合法主人的中华人民共和国却似乎不需要这个岛屿来保卫和它近在咫尺的中国领土。
