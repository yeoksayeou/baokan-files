    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow: The Twenty-Sixth All-Union Congress of Surgeons was held in Moscow from January 20th to 27th. The congress summarized the achievements of Soviet surgeons in solving new and most important medical problems in recent years, and determined the path for the future development of Soviet surgical medicine.

    The congress heard and discussed a total of eighty reports on complex surgical problems, including the principles of modern surgical physiology, thoracic organ surgery, and the surgical treatment of intestinal obstruction. The reports and discussions showed that, under the influence of the advanced theories of the great Russian physiologist Pavlov, Soviet medicine has made great progress in both theory and practice. Soviet surgeons are now able to perform the most complex operations in any situation. Surgeons in many Soviet hospitals can not only treat injuries to the heart and major blood vessels in adults and children, but also treat congenital and acquired heart diseases. The method of artificial blood circulation and the method of restoring functions that are about to be lost, proposed by Soviet scientists, have attracted the attention of surgeons performing heart surgery. Soviet surgeons have also made great achievements in the surgical treatment of various lung diseases, and are currently effectively treating severe purulent processes, pulmonary tuberculosis and other diseases. They have used new antibiotics that are helpful for the surgical treatment of lung diseases. In addition, Soviet surgeons have also made great achievements in the surgical treatment of early-stage bronchial cancer, and have proven that it is the only effective method for treating this disease in its early stages.

    At present, in the Soviet Union, not only hospitals in major cities can perform thoracic surgery, but also some district hospitals. In the past, only famous experts could perform complex surgery on internal organs, but now general doctors can also perform them.

    More than two thousand five hundred delegates from all over the Soviet Union attended the congress. Scientists from China, various People's Democratic countries, Britain, France, Italy, Argentina and other nineteen countries were also invited to participate in the congress.

    During the congress, foreign guests also gave about thirty scientific reports and spoke in discussions to exchange work experience.

    第二十六届全苏外科医生代表大会
    总结苏联几年来外科医学的新成就
    【新华社三十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：第二十六届全苏外科医生代表大会从二十日到二十七日在莫斯科举行。大会总结了几年来苏联外科医生在解决新的和最重要的医学问题方面所获得的成就，并且决定了今后苏联外科医学发展的道路。
    大会总共听取并且讨论了八十个复杂的外科学问题的报告，其中包括现代外科生理学原理、胸腔器官外科手术和肠梗阻的外科治疗问题。报告和讨论表明，在伟大的俄国生理学家巴甫洛夫的先进学说影响之下，苏联医学在理论和实践上已经获得了巨大的发展。苏联外科医生已经能在任何情况下进行最复杂的手术。苏联许多医院的外科医生不仅能医治大人和小孩的心脏和大血管的创伤，而且还能治疗先天的和后天性的心脏病。苏联科学家提出的人造血液循环法和恢复将要失去作用的官能的方法，已经引起施行心脏手术的外科医生的注意。苏联外科医生在用外科手术治疗各种肺病方面也取得很大成就，目前他们正在有效地治疗严重的化脓性过程、肺结核和其他疾病。他们已经使用了有助于肺病外科治疗的新抗生素。此外，苏联外科医生在使用外科手术治疗初发阶段的支气管癌方面也取得了巨大成就，并且已经证明它是治疗这种病症初发阶段的唯一有效的方法。
    目前，在苏联，不仅各大城市的医院能施行胸部手术，而且一些区级医院也能施行。过去仅有著名专家能进行内部器官的复杂手术，现在一般医生也能进行了。
    出席大会的有来自苏联各地的二千五百多个代表。中国、各人民民主国家、英国、法国、意大利、阿根廷等十九个国家的科学家也应邀参加了大会。
    在大会进行期间，外国来宾也在会上作了约三十个科学报告，并且在讨论中发了言，交流了工作经验。
