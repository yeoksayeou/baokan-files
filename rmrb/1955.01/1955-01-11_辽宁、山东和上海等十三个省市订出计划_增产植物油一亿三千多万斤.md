(Reported by this newspaper) The employees of the oil industry in thirteen provinces and cities, including Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, Shanxi, Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanghai, and Tianjin, have proposed an ambitious goal to increase vegetable oil production by a total of more than 130 million jin. Among them, Shandong Province plans to increase production by 24 million jin, Jiangsu Province plans to increase production by 20 million jin, Hubei Province plans to increase production by 14 million jin, Heilongjiang Province plans to increase production by 12.8 million jin, and Liaoning, Anhui, Henan, and Jiangxi provinces each plan to increase production by 10 million jin, while Jilin and Shanxi provinces each plan to increase production by 5 million jin.

In order to produce more oil to meet the needs of the people, these provinces and cities have convened oil industry conferences. The oil industry conferences in various provinces and cities analyzed the oil production situation in their respective provinces and cities, and believed that the oil yield of various oilseeds has been continuously improved in recent years, but there is still great potential. As long as advanced experiences are earnestly promoted and operating techniques are improved, it is entirely possible to produce one to two more jin of oil per hundred jin of oilseeds. For example, in Heilongjiang Province, which produces the most soybeans in China, the highest soybean oil yield currently reaches only 13% to 14%, while the lowest reaches only 10% to 11%. Recently, some oil mills have seriously promoted the Li Chuanjiang oil extraction method and improved their equipment, and the oil yield has increased to over 15%. As another example, last year in the second half of the year, employees of various oil mills in Shanghai studied the basic principles of Li Chuanjiang's soybean oil extraction method, and the oil yield of various oilseeds began to gradually increase. In the first half of last year, the state-owned Shanghai Oil and Fat Factory No. 1 had 5.14 jin of residual oil per hundred jin of peanut cake, but by the end of December, it had been reduced to 4.1 jin. After workers at the private Dayouyu Oil Mill changed their operating habits that had been followed for decades, the oil yield per hundred jin of soybeans also increased by one jin.

The oil industry production conferences in various provinces and cities have made specific arrangements for methods to improve oil yield, and are also working hard to develop new oil sources. The Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Industry plans to train 440 outstanding technicians, production section chiefs, and lab technicians this January, and to add three or four more testing stations in order to disseminate Li Chuanjiang's advanced oil extraction experience among oil extraction workers throughout the province. The Shanxi Provincial Department of Industry has also selected more than 30 technicians to go to the Northeast, Lüda, Baoding and other places to study oil extraction experience.

### 辽宁、山东和上海等十三个省市订出计划  增产植物油一亿三千多万斤

    辽宁、山东和上海等十三个省市订出计划
    增产植物油一亿三千多万斤
    【本报讯】　辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、热河、山西、河南、湖北、江西、山东、江苏、安徽和上海、天津等十三个省市油脂工业的职工，提出增产植物油的总数一亿三千多万斤的努力目标。其中山东省计划增产二千四百万斤，江苏省计划增产二千万斤，湖北省计划增产一千四百万斤，黑龙江省计划增产一千二百八十万斤，辽宁、安徽、河南、江西四省各计划增产一千万斤，吉林、山西两省各计划增产五百万斤。
    为了增产更多的油供应人民需要，这些省市分别召开了油脂工业会议。各省市油脂工业会议分析了本省、本市油脂生产的情况，认为几年来各种油料的产油率都不断提高，但是还有很大的潜力，只要认真推广先进经验，改进操作技术，每百斤油料多产一斤到二斤油是完全可以做到的。比如我国出产大豆最多的黑龙江省，目前，豆油产油率最高的才达到百分之十三到十四，最低的仅达到百分之十到十一。最近有些油厂认真地推广李川江榨油法和改进了设备后，产油率就提高到百分之十五以上。又如去年下半年上海各油脂厂职工学习了李川江大豆榨油操作法的基本原理，各种油料的产油率就开始逐步提高。国营上海油脂一厂去年上半年每百斤花生干饼中残存的油有五点一四斤，十二月底已降低到四点一斤。私营大有余油厂工人改变了几十年沿袭下来的操作习惯后，每百斤大豆的出油量也增加了一斤。
    各省市的油脂工业生产会议对提高产油率的办法都作了具体布置，同时正努力开辟新的油源。黑龙江省工业厅计划在今年一月训练四百四十名优秀的技术工人、生产股长和化验员，并增设三、四个化验站，以便在全省榨油工人中传播李川江的先进榨油经验。山西省工业厅还选派了三十多个技术工人分赴东北、旅大、保定等地学习榨油经验。
