Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 21st (TASS):
The Central Statistical Bureau of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union issued the following bulletin on the development of industry, agriculture, and transportation, capital construction, the expansion of domestic and foreign trade, the increase in the number of workers and staff, and the improvement of the material and cultural living standards of the people in 1954:

I. Implementation of the Industrial Production Plan
The annual industrial output plan was fulfilled by 103 percent. The fulfillment of the annual total output plans of various ministries is as follows (percentage of completion of the 1954 annual plan):

Soviet Ministry of Iron and Steel Industry - 101; Soviet Ministry of Non-Ferrous Metals Industry - 102; Soviet Ministry of Coal Industry - 101; Soviet Ministry of Petroleum Industry - 103; Ministry of Chemical Industry - 103; Ministry of Power Stations - 103; Ministry of Electrical Equipment Industry - 103; Ministry of Radio Industry - 104; Ministry of Heavy Machine Building - 104; Ministry of Machine Tool Manufacturing and Tool Industry - 104; Ministry of Transport Machine Building - 103; Ministry of Automobile, Tractor and Agricultural Machine Building - 105; Ministry of Machine and Instrument Building - 104; Ministry of Construction Machinery and Road Construction Machinery Building - 102; Soviet Ministry of Building Materials Industry - 103; Soviet Ministry of Forestry - 96; Ministry of Paper and Wood Processing Industry - 102; Soviet Ministry of Daily Consumer Goods Industry - 105; Soviet Ministry of Food Industry - 103; Soviet Ministry of Fisheries - 92; Soviet Ministry of Meat and Dairy Products Industry - 97; Industrial enterprises affiliated to the Ministry of Transportation - 105; Industrial enterprises affiliated to the Soviet Ministry of Culture - 106; Industrial enterprises affiliated to the Soviet Ministry of Health - 108; Local Industry and Fuel Industry Departments or Local Industry Departments of the various Union Republics - 106; Handicraft Cooperatives - 106.

In 1954, the total output of Soviet industry as a whole increased by 13 percent compared to 1953, and by 65 percent compared to 1950. This growth and the further increase in industrial production stipulated in the 1955 plan ensure the early completion of the task stipulated in the Fifth Five-Year Plan to increase industrial production by approximately 70 percent in 1955 compared to 1950.

In 1954, the production plans for many types of industrial products were overfulfilled.

The annual production plans were overfulfilled for many types of the most important heavy industrial products: coal, petroleum, peat, natural gas, iron ore and manganese ore, steel, steel products, steel pipes, coke, gasoline, kerosene, diesel oil, heavy oil, lubricating oil for machines and tractors, electricity, electric lights and vacuum tubes, steam turbines, locomotives, metal cutting lathes, electric motors, open-hearth equipment and steelmaking equipment, heavy-duty trucks, light vehicles and buses, motorcycles, tractors, traction planters, potato square planters, cotton pickers and grain cleaners, potato harvesting combines, spare parts for tractors and agricultural machinery, power bulldozers, ball bearings and roller bearings, synthetic ammonia, nitrogen fertilizer, superphosphate, dyes and other chemicals, synthetic rubber, automobile tires, cement, window glass, slate, asbestos, cast iron and ceramic drainage pipes, paper and other items.

The annual plan for the production of daily consumer goods was overfulfilled for: cotton fabrics, linen fabrics and silk fabrics, socks, leather shoes and rubber shoes, radios, cameras, pianos, butter, confectionery and macaroni, canned meat and canned meat vegetables, sausages, tea, wine, champagne, cigarettes, matches, soap, and other food and industrial products.

However, some ministries failed to guarantee the completion of the production plans for some types of industrial products in 1954. For example, the Soviet Ministry of Iron and Steel Industry did not complete the production plans for iron and several steel products, the Soviet Ministry of Non-Ferrous Metals Industry did not complete the production plans for several non-ferrous metals, the Ministry of Electrical Equipment Industry did not fully complete the production plans for several electrical equipment and electric locomotives, the Ministry of Radio Industry did not complete the production plan for televisions, the Ministry of Heavy Machine Building did not complete the production plan for steam boilers, large water turbines and rolling equipment, the Ministry of Machine Tool Manufacturing and Tool Industry did not complete the production plan for special large and heavy metal cutting machine tools, the Ministry of Transport Machine Building did not complete the production plans for freight cars and rolling equipment, the Ministry of Automobile, Tractor and Agricultural Machine Building did not complete the production plans for self-propelled grain combines, tractor-drawn cultivators and threshing machines, the Ministry of Machine and Instrument Building did not complete the production plans for chemical equipment and textile machinery, the Ministry of Chemical Industry did not complete the production plans for calcium carbide and potassium fertilizer, the Soviet Ministry of Building Materials Industry did not complete the production plans for bricks, soft roofing boards and several sanitary technical products, the Soviet Ministry of Forestry did not guarantee the completion of the plan for the transportation of sawn timber and the production plans for timber and broad-gauge sleepers, the Ministry of Paper and Wood Processing Industry did not complete the production plan for furniture, the Soviet Ministry of Food Industry did not complete the production plan for sugar, the Soviet Ministry of Meat and Dairy Products Industry did not complete the production plan for meat and animal oil, the Soviet Ministry of Fisheries did not complete the fishing plan.

Some ministries tolerated practices harmful to the state, overfulfilling tasks for some products that were not in short supply, while failing to complete production plans for important products.

In the implementation of the production plans for the entire industry and most departments, a considerable number of factories, mines, and petroleum enterprises failed to guarantee the completion of their original tasks in 1954.

One of the main shortcomings in the work of industrial departments is that, due to unsatisfactory production organization, a considerable amount of industrial enterprises worked without rhythm, with the majority of the monthly production tasks crammed into the end of the month, followed by a drop in production at the beginning of the next month. This led to idleness and equipment downtime, an overstaffing of workers exceeding the original plans, unproductive expenditures on work outside of stipulated hours, wage expenditures exceeding quotas, and an increase in defects and costs of production.

II. Growth of Industrial Production

The increase in the production of major industrial products in 1954 compared to 1953 is as follows (with 1953 output as 100):

Pig iron - 109, steel - 108, steel products - 109, steel pipes - 110, refined copper - 105, zinc - 107, lead - 113, coal - 108, petroleum - 112, gasoline - 109, kerosene - 105, diesel oil - 144, natural gas - 109, electricity - 101, steam turbines - 104, large water turbines - 182, hydroelectric generators - 162, large electrical machines - 112, electric motors - 114, locomotives - 113, electric locomotives - 107, trolleybuses - 119, heavy-duty trucks - 111, light vehicles - 123, buses - 134, motorcycles - 144, ball bearings and roller bearings - 113, metallurgical equipment - 105, excavators - 116, metal cutting lathes - 108, chemical equipment - 114, spinning machines - 109, weaving machines - 169, computers - 151, tractors - 122, three-row sugar beet harvesting combines - 240, tractor-drawn plows - 106, tractor-drawn cultivators - 107, compound threshing machines - 143, potato square planters - 490, grain cleaners - 122, caustic soda - 111, soda ash - 110, mineral fertilizer - 116, toxic chemicals for controlling diseases and pests of agricultural crops - 135, dyes - 107, synthetic rubber - 101, automobile tires - 114, sawn timber - 111, paper - 110, cement - 119, window glass - 114, slate tiles - 117, soft roofing boards - 109, bricks - 113, alcohol - 108, cotton fabrics - 106, woolen fabrics - 117, silk fabrics - 129, leather shoes - 107, rubber shoes - 102, socks - 110, knitted underwear - 118, knitted outerwear - 114, bicycles - 125, radios - 176, televisions - 300, gramophones - 131, sewing machines - 129, clocks and watches - 128, cameras - 154, pianos - 121, household refrigerators - 192, dust collectors - 290, household washing machines - 1300, iron beds - 133, furniture - 127, meat - 109, sausages - 111, fish - 114, animal oil - 102, vegetable oil - 111, margarine - 116, dairy products - 113, cheese - 112, confectionery - 103, macaroni - 115, canned goods - 116, tea - 111, soap - 121, cigarettes - 113, matches - 127, wine - 116, champagne - 132, beer - 103.

In 1954, the foundation of national economic development, heavy industry, continued to develop. The increase in the production of metals, coal, petroleum, electricity, chemicals, machines, and equipment ensured the growth of production in all industrial sectors. The production of daily consumer goods was also expanded.

In 1954, the variety of products from light industry and food industry enterprises improved, and the output of products popular with residents increased. For example, the output of cotton fabrics increased by 6 percent compared to 1953, including a 13 percent increase in mixed-color fabrics, a 22 percent increase in furniture upholstery fabrics, a 53 percent increase in colored yarn fabrics, and an 88 percent increase in pile fabrics; the output of woolen fabrics increased by 17 percent, including a 50 percent increase in worsted pure wool men's clothing fabrics, a 45 percent increase in worsted pure wool outerwear fabrics, and a 62 percent increase in pure wool fine overcoating fabrics; the output of socks increased by 10 percent, including a 22 percent increase in socks woven from "Kapron" fiber, a 35 percent increase in socks woven from wool and semi-wool yarn, and a 54 percent increase in men's plaid short socks; the output of knitted underwear increased by 18 percent, including a 27 percent increase in rayon knitted underwear; the output of knitted outerwear increased by 14 percent, including a 94 percent increase in pure wool knitted outerwear; the output of leather shoes increased by 7 percent, including an 18 percent increase in new-style shoes. However, the quality of some products in some enterprises producing consumer goods, especially in local and cooperative industries, was still unsatisfactory.

Although the number of living goods repair factories of handicraft cooperatives and local industries increased, there were still many shortcomings in serving the daily needs of residents.

Last year, the utilization of equipment in industry improved somewhat. In 1954, the utilization coefficient of the effective volume of open-hearth furnaces in factories of the Soviet Ministry of Iron and Steel Industry improved by 4 percent compared to 1953, and the output of steel per square meter of open-hearth furnace bottom area increased by 3 percent. The speed of petroleum drilling by enterprises of the Soviet Ministry of Petroleum Industry increased by 5 percent compared to 1953, and the speed of exploration increased by 6 percent. The proportion of light petroleum products extracted from raw materials also increased. The productivity of the "Donbass" coal mining combines in the various mines of the Soviet Ministry of Coal Industry increased. The rate of fuel consumption for electricity production at the various power plants of the Soviet Ministry of Power Stations decreased by 2.5 percent. The hourly productivity of the rotary kilns and rotary cement mills of the various enterprises of the Soviet Ministry of Building Materials Industry increased. The utilization of equipment in enterprises in the textile industry also improved.

At the same time, there are still considerable untapped potentials in industry. For example, in the Donbass, the projected production capacity of coal mines and the existing highly productive coal mining and loading equipment have not been fully utilized. In the petroleum industry, the annual plan for the speed of petroleum exploration was not completed, and drilling equipment was often idle. In the machine manufacturing industry, machine tools and forging and pressing machines were also not fully utilized. The various enterprises of the Soviet Ministry of Building Materials Industry did not complete the government-stipulated plan for increasing the productivity of major equipment. The use of machinery in the logging work of the Soviet Ministry of Forestry was unsatisfactory.

In 1954, the raw materials, materials, fuel, electricity, and equipment obtained by the Soviet national economy according to the state supply plan were much higher than in 1953. Due to the more economical use of raw materials, materials, fuel, and electricity, and due to the increase in labor productivity, the cost of industrial production in 1954 decreased by about 4 percent. However, the task of reducing the cost of industrial production in 1954 was not completed. The annual plans for reducing production costs were far from being completed by the Soviet Ministry of Coal Industry, the Soviet Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of Electrical Equipment Industry, the Soviet Ministry of Non-Ferrous Metals Industry, the Soviet Ministry of Meat and Dairy Products Industry, and the Soviet Ministry of Fisheries.

III. Promotion of New Technologies in the National Economy

In 1954, the development and promotion of new technologies continued, and the machine manufacturing industry manufactured many new types and brands of equipment for industry, construction, agriculture, and transportation; new technical operating procedures were implemented, and the scope of production automation and mechanization was expanded.

In terms of blast furnace production, the method of high pressure at the furnace top has been more widely adopted. The steel rolling production department has been able to produce new types of steel. However, ferrous metal smelting plants, especially non-ferrous metal smelting plants, have not fully utilized oxygen in the technical operating process.

The coal mining industry promoted the underground hydraulic coal mining method. Laborious operating procedures in coal mines, such as coal loading on the coal mining face and ore loading and gangue loading in tunneling work, have been further mechanized. However, the degree of mechanization of these operations is not sufficient and lags far behind the degree of mechanization of other operating procedures in coal mining. The Soviet Ministry of Coal Industry did not complete the plan for the mechanization of ore loading and gangue loading in tunneling work and the installation of metal supports on the coal mining face stipulated to be completed in 1954.

In the petroleum industry, the method of maintaining oil layer pressure and the method of secondary oil extraction, which can extract more oil from the oil layer, were more widely adopted.

The work of completely automating boiler workshops continued in thermal power plants. Compared to 1953, the power generation capacity of power systems controlled by operating consoles equipped with remote control equipment has expanded by one-half.

The Soviet Union attaches great importance to the peaceful use of atomic energy. In 1954, the first atomic energy industrial power station with an effective power generation capacity of 5,000 kilowatts began to generate electricity in the Soviet Union.

Although the degree of mechanization of logging work at the various logging sites of the Soviet Ministry of Forestry in 1954 was higher than in 1953, the overall mechanization of logging enterprises was still proceeding slowly. At the same time, the reorganization of logging work by logging machinery stations according to cycle charts was also proceeding unsatisfactorily.

In the construction industry, the work of further developing the industrialization method of using prefabricated reinforced concrete structures and components for various buildings and projects was implemented.

In various departments of the national economy, the movement of inventions and rationalization proposals continued to be carried out. In 1954 alone, more than 100,000 inventions, technical innovations, and rationalization proposals were adopted in industry, construction, and transportation.

However, some departments of the national economy, especially machine manufacturing, still have backward phenomena in creating and adopting new machines and equipment that meet the world's modern technical level, have economic value, and are highly productive. Insufficient attention is paid to reducing the weight of machines and machinery when designing new-style machines and machinery. Last year, various ministries did not fully complete the plans for manufacturing and producing new-style machines and equipment and for implementing production automation and advanced technical operating procedures.

IV. Agriculture

Collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms achieved considerable success last year in increasing the output of grain and other agricultural products. The sown area of various spring-sown crops sown in 1954 increased by 10.8 million hectares compared to 1953, of which the sown area of spring-sown grains increased by 7.2 million hectares. The total sown area of winter-sown and spring-sown crops harvested in 1954 increased by 8.9 million hectares compared to 1953.

In 1954, the sown area of cotton, sugar beet, oil crops, potatoes, vegetables, and melons was expanded; the sown area of annual pasture grasses, silage crops, and root feed was also increased. However, the plan for sowing fiber flax, hemp, and potatoes was not completed.

In 1954, although the southern Ukraine and the Volga River basin were affected by climatic conditions unfavorable to grain and other agricultural crops, the actual total harvest of grain nationwide, as well as the amount of grain requisitioned and purchased, was still higher than in 1953.

Collective farms and state farms both completed the state grain requisition and purchase plans ahead of schedule. As of December 5, 1954, 271 million poods more grain had been sold and sold to the state than in the same period in 1953. At the same time, the grain produced in Siberia (especially the Altai Krai) and Kazakhstan increased significantly.

The harvest of seed cotton, flax fiber, flax seeds, potatoes, vegetables, and other agricultural products was also higher than in 1953. 331,100 tons more seed cotton were requisitioned by the state than in 1953. 1.23 million tons more potatoes and 445,500 tons more vegetables were requisitioned and purchased by the state, and the requisition and purchase of other agricultural products also increased.

According to the resolution of the February-March Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union "On Reclaiming Virgin and Fallow Land to Further Expand Grain Production in the Soviet Union," the collective farms and state farms of Kazakhstan, Siberia, the Urals, the Volga River basin, and the North Caucasus reclaimed a total of 17.6 million hectares of virgin and fallow land for planting crops for the 1954 and 1955 harvests over the past year, while the plan stipulated 13 million hectares.

The collective farms and state farms sowed a total of 40.09 million hectares of winter crops for the 1955 harvest, which is 1.2 million hectares more than the sown area of winter crops for the 1954 harvest. The winter crop sowing plan of the collective farms and state farms has been overfulfilled.

The collective farms and state farms plowed much more autumn-plowed land and autumn-fallow land in the autumn of 1954 than in the autumn of 1953.

The material and technical foundation of agriculture was further strengthened in 1954. Last year, agriculture obtained 137,000 general-purpose tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower) and 46,000 actual cultivating tractors, 37,000 grain harvesting combines (including 17,000 self-propelled combines, 15,000 potato harvesting combines, and 5,000 industrial crop harvesting combines), 116,000 heavy-duty trucks, 100,000 tractor-drawn plows, 94,000 tractor-drawn planters, 94,000 tractor-drawn cultivators, approximately 200,000 self-propelled or tractor-drawn grain harvesters, and many other machines for cultivating, sowing, and harvesting, as well as machines and equipment for livestock farms.

Last year, a total of 115,000 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower), 18,000 grain harvesting combines, and a corresponding number of tractor-drawn connected agricultural implements and other agricultural machinery were transported to reclamation areas.

The improvement of agricultural technical equipment made it possible to mechanize agricultural work on a larger scale in collective farms and state farms. In 1954, the area of agricultural work done by machine tractor stations was 75 million hectares more than in 1953, undertaking 82 percent of the main field work of the collective farms. The work of plowing fallow land and autumn-plowed land in collective farms has been almost completely mechanized, and 95 percent of the winter crop sowing work and 88 percent of the spring crop sowing work have been mechanized. More than 40 percent of the potato sowing area in collective farms is sown by machine tractor stations. The area of potatoes, vegetables, sunflowers, and corn sown using the square planting method has been greatly expanded. 82 percent of the grain and 93 percent of the sunflowers are harvested by combines. The mechanization of the work of sowing and harvesting fiber flax, the work of harvesting potatoes and vegetables, the work of harvesting sugar beets and cotton, and the work of harvesting hay and silage is still lagging behind.

As of October 1, 1954, the number of publicly owned livestock in collective farms increased compared to October 1, 1953, as follows: dairy cows increased by 12 percent, pigs by 5 percent, and the number of sheep decreased by 2 percent due to unsatisfactory management of pastures during the winter of 1953-1954. From October 1, 1953, to October 1, 1954, the number of livestock in state farms affiliated to the Soviet State Farm Department also increased, with dairy cows increasing by 12 percent, pigs by 5 percent, and sheep by 3 percent.

The number of privately owned livestock of collective farm members, workers, and staff also increased.

The total number of livestock of various uses in collective farms, state farms, collective farm members, and employees, according to the materials registered on October 1, 1953, and October 1, 1954: dairy cows increased from 26 million to 27.5 million, the total number of cattle increased from 63 million to 64.9 million, pigs increased from 47.6 million to 51 million, and sheep increased from 114.9 million to 117.5 million.

Thus, the number of dairy cows in the Soviet Union increased by 1.5 million in one year, the total number of cattle increased by 1.9 million, pigs increased by 3.4 million, and sheep increased by 2.6 million.

V. Growth in Turnover of Railway, Waterway and Automobile Transportation

In 1954, the railway transportation industry overfulfilled the annual plan for freight turnover. The freight turnover increased by 42 percent compared to 1950. This means that the task stipulated in the Fifth Five-Year Plan, that the freight turnover of the railway transportation industry in 1955 should increase by 35 to 40 percent compared to 1950, has been completed in four years ahead of schedule.

In 1954, the average daily total loading plan for all goods was completed by 102 percent.

The plans for transporting coal, coke, petroleum, petroleum products, peat, ore, flux, ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, cement, grain, salt, fruits, vegetables, potatoes, vegetable oil, and fish have been completed or overfulfilled. The plans for transporting firewood, ferrous metal scrap, wood, refractory bricks, building materials, chemical and mineral fertilizers, cotton, and several kinds of consumer industrial products have not been completed.

The situation of freight cars stopping and waiting for goods improved somewhat in 1954 compared to 1953. The load capacity of freight cars increased by 5 percent compared to 1953, and the fuel consumption per ton-kilometer also decreased. The task of accelerating the turnaround of freight cars in 1954 was not completed, and the task of the running speed of freight cars in 1954 was also not completed.

The 1954 freight turnover plan for maritime transportation was completed by 109 percent, and the freight transportation plan was completed by 103 percent. The freight turnover of maritime transportation in 1954 increased by 18 percent compared to 1953, and freight transportation increased by 6 percent.

The full-year freight turnover plan for inland waterway transportation was completed by 100.8 percent, and the full-year freight transportation plan was completed by 104 percent. The freight turnover of inland waterway transportation increased by 6 percent compared to 1953, and freight transportation increased by 11 percent. The transportation plans for petroleum and liquid petroleum products, wood, coal, mineral building materials, rock, and cotton have been overfulfilled. The transportation plans for ore, metals, cement, grain, fruits, vegetables, fish, and fish products have not been completed. The task of utilizing ships by inland waterway transportation has not been completed.

The public automobile transportation industry of the Soviet Automobile Transportation and Highway Department completed 98 percent of the freight turnover and freight transportation plans in 1954. The freight turnover of public automobile transportation in 1954 increased by 66 percent compared to 1953, and freight transportation increased by 75 percent.

VI. Growth in Capital Construction

The total amount of state capital construction investment in 1954 was 115 percent of 1953. The total amount of capital construction investment in 1953 was 104 percent of 1952.

In 1954, capital construction investment in heavy industry, light industry and food industry, agriculture, transportation industry and trade increased compared to 1953. The total amount of basic investment in culture-life construction in 1954 increased by 30 percent compared to 1953.

In 1954, a significant portion of production capacity in various sectors of the national economy was put into production. More than 600 large industrial enterprises have been built and put into production. The Ministry of Power Stations completed the prescribed power station power generation plan.

Basic construction has grown, but in 1954 the basic investments in the national economy and the production capacity investment plans were not completed. The plans were far from being completed by: the Soviet Ministry of Iron and Steel Industry, the Soviet Ministry of Non-Ferrous Metals Industry, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the Ministry of Building Machinery and Road Construction Machinery Manufacturing, the Paper and Wood Processing Industry, the Soviet Ministry of Building Materials Industry and the Soviet Ministry of Procurement.

The construction and installation work contracted by the Soviet Ministry of Construction in 1954 was 20 percent more than in 1953, and the Soviet Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and Chemical Industry Enterprises Construction increased by 9 percent compared to 1953. However, these departments did not complete the annual plan.

In 1954, the total amount of construction machinery and equipment continued to grow. The total number of existing excavators increased by 20 percent compared to 1953, bulldozers increased by 26 percent, and mobile cranes increased by 25 percent. However, machines and equipment have not been fully used in many construction projects, and the degree of mechanization of heavy work is not high enough.

In 1954, construction costs declined somewhat compared to 1953. However, in many construction projects, due to overhead costs exceeding quotas, and due to non-productive waste and losses, the task of increasing labor productivity and reducing construction costs in 1954 was not completed. Many construction projects are delayed in completion of industrial enterprises, housing and other projects under construction due to the dispersion of investment.

There are major shortcomings in design work. Industrial plants and buildings, residences, cultural and life buildings pay too much attention to the decoration of the building. Design budgets are not delivered to construction sites completely and on time; temporary changes often occur due to the poor quality of design drawings, which increases the cost of construction projects. Design agencies have not paid due attention to standard designs, and the standard design plan for 1954 has been far from completed.

VII. Growth of Domestic and Foreign Trade

Soviet trade continued to expand further in 1954. The retail commodity turnover plan for 1954 was overfulfilled.

On the basis of new achievements in developing production, improving labor productivity, and reducing product costs, the government reduced the state retail prices of consumer goods on April 1, 1954, which was the seventh time since the abolition of the rationing system. The new price reduction helped to further consolidate the Soviet ruble and improve the living standards of our people.

In 1954, the goods sold to residents by state-owned and cooperative trade increased by 18 percent compared to 1953, calculated at comparable prices. At the same time, the goods sold by consumer cooperatives in rural areas in 1954 increased by 29 percent compared to 1953.

In 1954, the retail commodity turnover increased by 80 percent compared to 1950, calculated at comparable prices. This means that the task of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, that the retail commodity turnover of state-owned and cooperative trade in 1955 should increase by approximately 70 percent compared to 1950, has been completed in four years ahead of schedule.

In 1954, the sales volume of various types of food increased compared to 1953, as follows: meat and meat products increased by 16 percent, fish and fish products increased by 18 percent, animal oil increased by 7 percent, vegetable oil and other edible oils increased by 22 percent, cheese increased by 13 percent, milk and milk products increased by 10 percent, eggs increased by 6 percent, sugar increased by 10 percent, confectionery increased by 11 percent, tea increased by 20 percent, and vegetables increased by 15 percent.

In 1954, the sales volume of industrial products increased greatly compared to 1953. For example, cotton fabrics increased by 18 percent, woolen fabrics increased by 25 percent, silk fabrics increased by 28 percent, clothing increased by 22 percent, knitwear increased by 23 percent, socks increased by 24 percent, and leather shoes increased by 16 percent. The sales volume of cultural and livelihood welfare products also increased greatly: radios increased by 76 percent, televisions increased by more than two times, clocks and watches increased by 24 percent, cameras increased by 57 percent, gramophones increased by 26 percent, furniture increased by 25 percent, sewing machines increased by 25 percent, washing machines increased by ten times, dust collectors increased by 2.7 times, refrigerators increased by 80 percent, bicycles increased by 23 percent, motorcycles increased by 36 percent, and light vehicles increased by 38 percent. In 1954, the sales volume of production goods increased compared to 1953, as follows: plywood increased by 7 percent, roofing iron increased by 14 percent, cement increased by 26 percent, slate increased by 5 percent, nails increased by 36 percent, window glass increased by 37 percent, and heavy-duty trucks for collective farms increased by 44 percent. Although the production and sales volume of industrial products and food have greatly increased, they still cannot fully meet the growing demand of residents for many important daily necessities. At the same time, some trade organizations incorrectly allocate goods to various regions and transport goods to individual regions without considering the needs of residents. Trade organizations often fail to make the necessary strict quality requirements on industry in terms of the goods sold to residents. Insufficient efforts have been made to use local raw materials to more widely develop commodity production, so that additional sources of goods enter the commodity turnover.

In terms of foreign trade, the Soviet Union continued to expand its economic ties with foreign countries in 1954. Last year, the Soviet Union conducted trade with 56 countries.

VIII. Increase in Number of Employees and Improvement of Labor Productivity

The number of employees in the Soviet national economy at the end of 1954 was approximately 47 million, which is 2 million more than at the end of 1953. In industry, agriculture, construction and transportation, the number of employees increased by 1.7 million. The number of staff in educational institutions, scientific research institutions, medical institutions, trade institutions, public catering enterprises, and residential public utilities increased. The number of office workers decreased as some administrative staff transferred to participate directly in production.

As in previous years, there was no unemployment in the country last year.

Last year, more than 700,000 skilled workers graduated from factory-affiliated schools, mining schools, vocational schools, railway schools, mining and specialized vocational schools, agricultural mechanization vocational schools, and agricultural mechanization schools, and were assigned to work in industry, construction, transportation, and agriculture, including 330,000 who were machinery operators in agriculture.

In 1954, 7.7 million workers and staff improved their skills and received professional training through individual-group learning methods or training courses. Due to the improvement of the technical equipment of labor and the improvement of the skills of workers, labor productivity in industry in 1954 increased by 7 percent compared to 1953, and labor productivity in the construction industry increased by 8 percent. The Soviet Ministry of Fisheries and the Soviet Ministry of Meat and Dairy Products Industry failed to complete the plan to increase industrial labor productivity stipulated for 1954, and the construction enterprise of the Metallurgical Industry and Chemical Industry failed to complete the plan to increase labor productivity in the construction industry stipulated for 1954. The other departments completed the labor productivity improvement plan as a whole, but they have many enterprises and construction projects that have not been able to complete their own labor productivity improvement plans.

IX. Increase in National Income and Improvement of People's Material and Cultural Living Standards

The material and cultural living standards of the people were further improved in 1954. In 1954, the national income of the Soviet Union increased by 11 percent compared to 1953. The reduction in state retail prices of consumer goods implemented in 1954 gave residents a direct benefit of 20 billion rubles (calculated annually).

The growth in national income, the reduction in state retail prices, and the measures taken by the Party and the government in agriculture ensured a further increase in the income of workers, staff, and farmers. Due to the increase in monetary wages and the reduction in prices, the actual wages of workers and staff increased by 5 percent in one year.

Due to the measures implemented in the second half of 1953 and 1954 in terms of state requisition and purchase of agricultural products and reduction of taxes, the income of collective farms and farm members increased greatly. The financial situation of collective farms has strengthened. In 1954, the deposits of collective farms in the indivisible fund deposited in the Agricultural Bank increased by 35 percent, and the current deposits in the State Bank increased by 78 percent.

As in previous years, residents received subsidies from the state and social insurance costs for employees, social security pensions, subsidies for mothers with multiple children and single mothers, scholarships for students, medical subsidies, free and reduced-price permits to stay in sanatoriums and rest homes, free learning and improvement of professional skills, expenses in many other aspects, and reduced and free treatment. In addition, all employees have vacations of at least two weeks, and wages are paid during the vacation period, and the vacations of staff in

    苏联部长会议中央统计局
    关于苏联一九五四年发展国民经济国家计划执行结果的公报
    一九五四年，工业、农业和运输业的发展，基本建设以及国内和对外贸易的扩大，工人和职员人数的增加和人民物质生活和文化生活水平提高的情况如下：
    一、工业生产计划的执行情况
    工业的年度总产量计划整个说来完成了百分之一百零三。各个部年度总产量计划的执行情况如下（完成一九五四年年度计划的百分数）：
    苏联钢铁工业部——一○一；苏联有色金属工业部——一○二；苏联采煤工业部——一○一；苏联石油工业部——一○三；化学工业部——一○三；电站部——一○三；电工器材工业部——一○三；无线电工业部——一○四；重型机器制造部——一○四；母机制造和工具工业部——一○四；运输机器制造部——一○三；汽车、拖拉机和农业机器制造部——一○五；机器和仪器制造部——一○四；建筑机器和筑路机器制造部——一○二；苏联建筑材料工业部——一○三；苏联林业部——九六；造纸和木材加工工业部——一○二；苏联日用品工业部——一○五；苏联食品工业部——一○三；苏联渔业部——九二；苏联肉乳制品工业部——九七；交通部所属各工业企业——一○五；苏联文化部所属各工业企业——一○六；苏联卫生部所属各工业企业——一○八；各加盟共和国地方工业和燃料工业部或地方工业部——一○六；手工业合作社——一○六。
    一九五四年苏联工业的总产量整个说来比一九五三年增加了百分之十三，比一九五零年增加了百分之六十五。这种增长和一九五五年计划所规定的工业生产的进一步增加，保证提前完成第五个五年计划所规定的在一九五五年把工业生产量比一九五零年约增加百分之七十的任务。
    一九五四年，许多种类工业品的生产计划超额完成了。
    超额完成全年生产计划的有许多种类的最重要的重工业产品：煤、石油、泥炭、天然煤气、铁矿砂和锰矿砂、钢、钢材、钢管、焦炭、汽油、煤油、柴油、重油、机器用和拖拉机用润滑油、电力、电灯和电力真空仪器、汽轮机、机车、金属切削车床、电动机、平炉装备和炼钢装备、载重汽车、轻型汽车和公共汽车、机器脚踏车、拖拉机、牵引播种机、马铃薯正方穴播机、摘棉机和清谷机、马铃薯收获联合机、拖拉机和农业机器的备件、机力推土机、滚珠轴承和滚柱轴承、合成氨、氮肥、过磷酸钙、染料和其他化学品、人造橡胶、汽车外胎、水泥、窗玻璃、石板、石棉、生铁制和陶制的排水管、纸张和其他物品。
    日用品生产超额完成一年计划的有：棉织品、麻织品和丝织品、长短袜子、皮鞋和胶鞋、收音机、照相机、大小钢琴、牛油、糖食和通心粉、肉类罐头和肉类蔬菜罐头、腊肠、茶叶、葡萄酒、香槟酒、香烟、火柴、肥皂以及其他食品和工业品。
    但是有些部在一九五四年没有保证完成一些种类工业产品的生产计划。例如，苏联钢铁工业部没有完成铁和几种钢材的生产计划，苏联有色金属工业部没有完成几种有色金属的生产计划，电工器材工业部没有全面完成几种电气设备和电动机车的生产计划，无线电工业部没有完成电视机的生产计划，重型机器制造部没有完成蒸汽锅炉、大型水轮机和辗压设备的生产计划，母机制造和工具工业部没有完成特种的大型和重型金属切削机床的生产计划，运输机器制造部没有完成货车和辗压设备的生产计划，汽车、拖拉机和农业机器制造部没有完成自动推进谷物联合机、拖拉机牵引中耕机和打谷机的生产计划，机器和仪器制造部没有完成化工设备和纺织机器的生产计划，化学工业部没有完成碳化钙和钾肥料的生产计划，苏联建筑材料工业部没有完成砖、软屋顶板和几种卫生技术制品的生产计划，苏联林业部没有保证完成锯开的木材的运出计划和成材、宽轨枕木的生产计划，造纸和木材加工工业部没有完成家具的生产计划，苏联食品工业部没有完成糖的生产计划，苏联肉乳制品工业部没有完成肉类和动物油的生产计划，苏联渔业部没有完成捕鱼计划。
      有些部容忍了对国家有害的做法，在一些不感  缺少的产品上超额完成了任务，而在一些重要的产品上却没有完成生产计划。
    在执行整个工业和大多数部门的生产计划中，有相当多的工厂、矿场和石油企业在一九五四年没有保证完成原定的任务。
    工业部门工作中的主要缺点之一是：由于生产组织得不能令人满意，有相当多的工业企业工作得没有节奏，每月的生产任务大部分挤在月底完成，到下个月月初生产又下降。这便造成了窝工和设备停歇的现象，使得工人数量的配备超过原定计划，造成了规定时间以外的工作的非生产性的开支，造成了工资支出超出定额的现象，并且使得生产中的废品增加和产品成本提高。
    二、工业品生产的增长
    一九五四年主要工业品的生产同一九五三年相比增加的情形如下（以一九五三年的产量为一百）：
    生铁——一○九，钢——一○八，钢材——一○九，钢管——一一○，精炼铜——一○五，锌——一○七，铅——一一三，煤——一○八，石油——一一二，汽油——一○九，煤油——一○五，柴油——一四四，天然煤气——一○九，电力——一○一，汽轮机——一○四，大型水轮机——一八二，水力发电机——一六二，大型电力机器——一一二，电动机——一一四，机车——一一三，电动机车——一○七，无轨电车——一一九，载重汽车——一一一，轻型汽车——一二三，公共汽车——一三四，机器脚踏车——一四四，滚珠轴承和滚柱轴承——一一三，冶金设备——一○五，挖掘机——一一六，金属切削车床——一○八，化工设备——一一四，纺纱机——一○九，织布机——一六九，计算机——一五一，拖拉机——一二二，三行甜菜收割联合机——二四○，拖拉机牵引犁——一○六，拖拉机牵引中耕机——一○七，复式打谷机——一四三，马铃薯正方穴播机——四九○，清谷机——一二二，苛性钠——一一一，碳酸钠——一一○，矿质肥料——一一六，防治农业作物病虫害的毒质化学品——一三五，染料——一○七，合成橡胶——一○一，汽车外胎——一一四，锯开的木材——一一一，纸张——一一○，水泥——一一九，门窗玻璃——一一四，石板瓦——一一七，软屋顶板——一○九，砖——一一三，酒精——一○八，棉织品——一○六，毛织品——一一七，丝织品——一二九，皮鞋——一○七，胶鞋——一○二，长短袜——一一○，针织内衣——一一八，针织外衣——一一四，自行车——一二五，无线电收音机——一七六，电视机——三○○，留声机——一三一，缝纫机——一二九，钟表——一二八，照像机——一五四，大小钢琴——一二一，家用冰箱——一九二，除尘器——二九○，家用洗衣机——一、三○○，铁床——一三三，家具——一二七，肉类——一○九，腊肠——一一一，鱼类——一一四，动物油——一○二，植物油——一一一，人造牛油——一一六，乳制品——一一三，干酪——一一二，糖果点心——一○三，通心粉——一一五，罐头——一一六，茶叶——一一一，肥皂——一二一，香烟——一一三，火柴——一二七，葡萄酒——一一六，香槟酒——一三二，啤酒——一○三。
    一九五四年，国民经济发展的基础——重工业继续得到了发展。金属、煤、石油、电力、化学品、机器和设备的产量的增加，保证了各工业部门生产的增长。日用品的生产也扩大了。
    在一九五四年，轻工业和食品工业企业的产品种类改善了，很受居民欢迎的产品的产量增加了。例如，棉织品的产量比一九五三年增加了百分之六，其中混色织物增加了百分之十三，家具装饰织品增加了百分之二十二，色纱织物增加了百分之五十三，起毛织物增加了百分之八十八；毛织品的产量增加了百分之十七，其中精梳纯毛男衣料增加了百分之五十，精梳纯毛外衣料增加了百分之四十五，纯毛细呢大衣料增加了百分之六十二；长短袜的产量增加了百分之十，其中“卡普隆”纤维织成的长短袜增加了百分之二十二，用羊毛和半羊毛纱织成的长短袜增加了百分之三十五，男子花格短袜增加了百分之五十四；针织内衣的产量增加了百分之十八，其中人造丝针织内衣增加了百分之二十七；针织外衣的产量增加了百分之十四，其中纯毛针织外衣增加了百分之九十四；皮鞋的产量增加了百分之七，其中新式鞋子增加了百分之十八。但是，在某些生产消费品的企业中，特别是地方和合作社工业中，有些产品的质量还不能令人满意。
    虽然工艺合作社和地方工业的生活用品修理厂增加了，但是，在为居民的日常需要服务方面还存在着许多缺点。
    去年，工业中设备的利用有了一些改善。一九五四年，苏联钢铁工业部各工厂的平炉有效容积利  用系数比一九五三年改进了百分之四，每一平方公尺平炉炉底面积的出钢量增加了百分之三。苏联石油工业部各企业石油钻探的速度比一九五三年提高了百分之五，勘探的速度提高了百分之六。从原料中提炼出轻质石油产品的比例也增加了。苏联采煤工业部的各矿井中的“顿巴斯”采煤联合机的生产率提高了。苏联电站部所属各发电站用于生产电力的燃料的消耗率减少了百分之二点五。苏联建筑材料工业部各企业的回转矿炉和回转水泥磨机的每小时的生产率提高了。在纺织工业各企业中，设备的利用也有了改善。
    同时，在工业中还有着相当大的没有发掘的潜力。例如在顿巴斯，煤矿的预计生产能力以及现有的生产力很高的采煤和装煤设备还没有充分利用。在石油工业中，勘测石油的速度的全年计划没有完成，钻探设备常常停歇。在机器制造业中，机床以及锻压机器也没有充分利用。苏联建筑材料工业部各企业没有完成政府规定的关于提高主要设备生产率的计划。苏联林业部伐木工作中的机械使用得不能令人满意。
    一九五四年，苏联国民经济根据国家供应计划获得的原料、材料、燃料、电力和装备比一九五三年多了许多。由于更加节约地使用原料、材料、燃料和电力，由于提高了劳动生产率，一九五四年工业生产的成本减低了百分之四左右。但是一九五四年减低工业生产成本的任务没有完成。远没有完成减低生产成本的年度计划的有：苏联采煤工业部、苏联林业部、电工器材工业部、苏联有色金属工业部、苏联肉乳制品工业部和苏联渔业部。
    三、国民经济中新技术的推广
    一九五四年继续发展和推广了新技术，机器制造业制造了许多新的型式和新牌子的工业、建筑、农业和运输用的设备；推行了新的技术操作过程，扩大了生产自动化和机械化的范围。
    在高炉生产方面，已经更广泛地采用了炉顶高压法。轧钢生产部门已能生产新型的钢。然而，黑色金属冶炼厂，特别是有色金属冶炼厂还没有在技术操作过程中充分利用氧气。
    采煤工业推广了井下水力采煤法。煤矿中的费力操作过程，如采煤工作面上的装煤和掘进工作中的装煤和装?子等，都更进一步地机械化了。但是这些操作的机械化，程度还不够，还远远落后于采煤中的其他操作过程的机械化程度。苏联采煤工业部没有完成规定在一九五四年完成的掘进工作中装煤和装?子工作的机械化方面以及采煤工作面中安装金属支架方面的计划。
    在石油工业中，更广泛地采用了保持油层压力法和二次采油法，用这些方法可从油层中采出更多的石油来。
    火力发电站中继续进行了锅炉车间全盘自动化的工作。和一九五三年相比，由装备有远距离操纵设备的操纵台控制的电力系统的发电能力扩大了二分之一。
    苏联非常重视原子能的和平用途。一九五四年，有效发电能力为五千瓩的第一个原子能工业电力站在苏联开始发电了。
    一九五四年苏联林业部所属各伐木场工作的机械化程度虽然比一九五三年提高了一些，但是伐木企业的全面机械化还是进行得很缓慢。同时，伐木机械站按照循环图表重新组织伐木工作也进行得不能令人满意。
    在建筑业中实行了进一步发展用装配式钢筋混凝土结构和构件来进行各项建筑和工程的工业化方法的工作。
    在国民经济各个部门中，继续开展了发明和合理化建议的运动。在一九五四年一年中，工业、建筑业和运输业中采用的发明、技术革新和合理化建议有十万件以上。
    但是，国民经济中有些部门，特别是机器制造业，在创造和采用符合于现代世界技术水平的、具有经济价值和高度生产效能的新机器和新设备方面，还存在有落后现象。在设计新式机器和机械的时候，对减轻机器和机械的重量注意不够。去年，各部并没有完全完成制成和生产新式机器和设备以及在实行生产自动化和实行先进技术操作过程方面的计划。
    四、农业
    集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场去年在增加谷物和其他农产品的产量方面获得了相当大的成就。一九五四年播种的各种春播作物的播种面积，比一九五三年增加了一千零八十万公顷，其中春播谷物的播种面积增多七百二十万公顷。一九五四年收获的冬播和春播作物的总播种面积比一九五三年增多八百九十万公顷。
    一九五四年扩大了棉花、甜菜、油料作物、马铃薯、蔬菜和瓜类的播种面积；一年生牧草、青贮作物和块根饲料的播种面积也增加了。但是计划规定的播种纤维用亚麻、大麻和马铃薯的任务并没有完成。
    一九五四年，虽然在乌克兰南部和伏尔加河流域各区受到不利于谷物和其他农作物的气候条件的影响，但是全国谷物的实际总收获量以及谷物征购和收购量还是比一九五三年高。
    集体农庄和国营农场都提前完成了国家征购和收购粮食的计划。截至一九五四年十二月五日为止，向国家交售和出售的粮食比一九五三年同一时期多两亿七千一百万普特。同时，西伯利亚（特别是阿尔泰边疆区）和哈萨克所产的粮食大大增加了。
    籽棉、亚麻纤维、亚麻种子、马铃薯、蔬菜和其他农产品的收获量也比一九五三年多。国家征购的籽棉比一九五三年多三十三万一千吨。国家征购和收购的马铃薯多一百二十三万吨，蔬菜多四十四万五千吨，征购和收购的其他农产品也有增加。
    哈萨克、西伯利亚、乌拉尔、伏尔加河流域和北高加索的各集体农庄和国营农场，根据苏联共产党中央委员会二、三月全体会议“关于开垦生荒地和熟荒地以进一步扩大苏联的谷物生产”的决议，在过去一年中开垦了用来种植一九五四年和一九五五年收获的庄稼的生荒地和熟荒地共达一千七百六十万公顷，而计划规定是一千三百万公顷。
    各集体农庄和国营农场共播种了四千零九十万公顷的一九五五年收获的冬季作物，即比一九五四年收获的冬季作物的播种面积多一百二十万公顷。各集体农庄和国营农场的冬播作物播种计划已经超额完成了。
    各集体农庄和国营农场在一九五四年秋天所翻耕的秋耕地和秋耕休闲地比一九五三年秋天多得多。
    农业的物质和技术基础在一九五四年更加加强了。去年农业获得了十三万七千台一般用拖拉机（每台以十五匹马力计算）和四万六千台实有中耕用拖拉机，三万七千台谷物收割联合机（其中包括一万七千台自动联合机、一万五千台马铃薯收获联合机和五千台工业作物收获联合机），十一万六千辆载重汽车，十万部拖拉机牵引犁，九万四千台拖拉机牵引播种机，九万四千台拖拉机牵引中耕机，约二十万台自动的或拖拉机牵引的谷物收割机，以及其他许多耕作、播种和收割用的机器，还有牲畜饲养场用的机器和设备。
    去年共有十一万五千台拖拉机（每台以十五匹马力计算）、一万八千台谷物收割联合机和相应数量的拖拉机牵引的连挂农具以及其他农业机器，运到开垦地区去。
    农业技术装备的提高使得集体农庄和国营农场中的农业工作可以更大规模地机械化。一九五四年各机器拖拉机站所做的农业工作的田地面积，比一九五三年多七千五百万公顷，承担了集体农庄的百分之八十二的主要田间工作。集体农庄中翻耕休耕地和秋耕地的工作几乎已经完全机械化，百分之九十五的冬播作物播种工作和百分之八十八的春播作物播种工作已经机械化了。集体农庄中有百分之四十以上的马铃薯播种面积是由机器拖拉机站来播种的。用正方穴播法播种的马铃薯、蔬菜、向日葵和玉蜀黍的田地已大大扩大了。有百分之八十二的谷物和百分之九十三的向日葵是用联合机收割的。播种和收割纤维用亚麻的工作、收割马铃薯和蔬菜的工作、收割甜菜和棉花的工作以及收获干草和青贮料的工作的机械化还是落后的。
    到一九五四年十月一日为止，集体农庄公有牲畜的头数比一九五三年十月一日增加的情形如下：乳牛增加了百分之十二、猪百分之五，羊的头数因为一九五三—一九五四年冬季时在放牧场上管理的情况不能令人满意，减少了百分之二。从一九五三年十月一日到一九五四年十月一日，苏联国营农场部所属国营农场的牲畜头数也增加了，乳牛增加了百分之十二，猪增加了百分之五，羊增加了百分之三。
    集体农庄庄员、工人和职员的私有牲畜头数也增加了。
    集体农庄、国营农场、集体农庄庄员和职工的不同用途的牲畜总头数，根据一九五三年十月一日和一九五四年十月一日登记的材料：乳牛由二千六百万头增为二千七百五十万头，牛的总头数由六千三百万头增为六千四百九十万头，猪由四千七百六十万口增为五千一百万口，羊由一亿一千四百九十万只增为一亿一千七百五十万只。
    这样，苏联乳牛的头数在一年中增加了一百五十万头，牛的总头数增加了一百九十万头，猪增加了三百四十万口，羊增加了二百六十万只。
    五、铁路、水路和汽车运输业运转额的增长
    一九五四年，铁路运输业超额完成了货物运转额的一年计划。货物周转量比一九五零年增加了百分之四十二。这就是说，第五个五年计划所规定的任务，即一九五五年铁路运输业的货物周转量应比一九五零年增加百分之三十五到四十的任务，已经提前在四年内完成了。
    一九五四年，所有货物的每昼夜平均装载总计划完成了百分之一百零二。
    运输煤、焦炭、石油、石油制品、泥炭、矿砂、熔剂、黑色金属、有色金属、水泥、谷物、盐、果品、蔬菜、马铃薯、植物油和鱼的计划，已经完成或者超额完成了。运输木柴、黑色金属废料、木材、耐火砖、建筑材料、化学和矿物肥料、棉花和若干种消费工业品的计划没有完成。
    一九五四年和一九五三年相比，火车车皮停车待货的情况减少了一些。火车载重量和一九五三年相比增加了百分之五，每吨公里的燃料耗费也降低了。一九五四年加速货车运转的任务没有完成，一九五四年运货车辆运行速度的任务也没有完成。
    海洋运输业一九五四年的货物周转量计划完成了百分之一百零九，货物运输计划完成了百分之一百零三。一九五四年海洋运输业货物周转量比一九五三年增加了百分之十八，货物运输增加了百分之六。
    内河运输业全年货物周转量计划完成了百分之一○○·八，全年货物运输计划完成了百分之一○四。内河运输业货物周转量比一九五三年增加了百分之六，货物运输增加了百分之十一。石油和液体石油产品、木材、煤、矿物建筑材料、岩石和棉花的运输计划都超额完成了。矿砂、金属、水泥、谷物、水果、蔬菜、鱼和鱼类制品的运输计划没有完成。内河运输业利用船只的任务没有完成。
    苏联汽车运输和公路部公用汽车运输业一九五四年完成货物周转量和货物运输计划百分之九十八。一九五四年公用汽车运输业货物周转量比一九五三年增加了百分之六十六，货物运输增加了百分之七十五。
    六、基本建设的增长
    一九五四年国家基本建设投资总额为一九五三年的百分之一一五。而一九五三年的基本建设投资总额为一九五二年的百分之一○四。
    一九五四年在重工业、轻工业和食品工业、农业、运输业和贸易方面的基本建设投资，比一九五三年增加了。一九五四年文化—生活建设的基本投资总额比一九五三年增加了百分之三十。
    一九五四年国民经济各部门中有相当大一部分生产能力投入了生产。六百多个大型工业企业已经建成，并且投入了生产。电站部完成了规定的电站发电计划。
    基本建设增长了，但是一九五四年对国民经济的基本投资和生产能力投入生产的计划没有完成。远远没有完成计划的有：苏联钢铁工业部、苏联有色金属工业部、化学工业部、建筑机器和筑路机器制造部、造纸和木材加工工业部、苏联建筑材料工业部和苏联采购部。
    苏联建造部一九五四年完成的包工建筑安装工作比一九五三年多百分之二十，苏联冶金工业和化学工业企业建造部比一九五三年增加了百分之九。但是这些部门没有完成一年计划。
    在一九五四年，建筑机器和机械的总额继续增长。现有的挖掘机总数比一九五三年增加了百分之二十，铲土机和推土机增加了百分之二十六，移动起重机增加了百分之二十五。但是，在许多建筑工程中，还没有充分使用机器和机械，繁重工作机械化的程度还不够。
    在一九五四年，建筑成本比一九五三年有些下降。但是在许多建筑工程中，由于杂费超过定额，由于非生产的浪费和损失，一九五四年提高劳动生产率和降低建筑成本的任务没有完成。许多建筑工程由于投资分散，建筑中的工业企业、住宅和其他工程的完工期限拖延。
    在设计工作中存在着很大的缺点。工业厂房和建筑、住宅、文化生活建筑物过分注意建筑的装饰。设计预算书不完全及时送往建筑工地；时常发生由于设计图样质量不好而临时更改的事情，这就增加了建筑工程的造价。设计机关对标准设计还没有给予应有的注意，一九五四年的标准设计计划远未完成。
    七、国内和对外贸易的增长
    苏联贸易在一九五四年进一步继续扩大。一九五四年的零售商品流转计划超额完成了。
    在发展生产、提高劳动生产率和减低产品成本方面获得新成就的基础上，政府在一九五四年四月一日减低消费品的国家零售价格，这是废除配给制以后的第七次。新的减价有助于进一步巩固苏联的卢布和提高我国人民的生活水平。
    在一九五四年中，国营和合作社贸易销售给居民的商品，按比较价格计算，比一九五三年增加了百分之十八。同时，一九五四年农村中消费合作社销售的商品比一九五三年增加了百分之二十九。
    一九五四年，零售商品流转额按比较价格计算比一九五零年增加了百分之八十。这就是说，第五个五年计划的任务，即国营和合作社贸易零售商品流转额在一九五五年比一九五零年增加约百分之七十的任务，已经在四年中提前完成了。
    一九五四年，各类食品销售量比一九五三年增加的情形如下：肉类和肉制品增加了百分之十六，鱼类和鱼制品百分之十八，动物油百分之七，植物油和其他食用油百分之二十二，奶酪百分之十三，奶类和奶制品百分之十，蛋百分之六，糖百分之十，糖食百分之十一，茶叶百分之二十，蔬菜百分之十五。
    一九五四年，工业品的销售量比一九五三年大大增加了。例如，棉织品增加了百分之十八，毛织品百分之二十五，丝织品百分之二十八，服装百分之二十二，针织品百分之二十三，长短袜百分之二十四，皮鞋百分之十六。文化生活福利用品的出售量也大大增加了：收音机增加了百分之七十六，电视机增加为两倍以上，钟表增加了百分之二十四，照像机百分之五十七，留声机百分之二十六，家具百分之二十五，缝纫机百分之二十五，洗衣机增加为十倍，除尘器增加为二点七倍，冰箱增加了百分之八十，脚踏车百分之二十三，机器脚踏车百分之三十六，轻型汽车百分之三十八。一九五四年生产用品的销售量比一九五三年增加的情形如下：胶合板百分之七，屋顶用铁皮百分之十四，水泥百分之二十六，石板百分之五，钉子百分之三十六，窗玻璃百分之三十七，集体农庄用的载重汽车百分之四十四。工业品和食品的生产量和销售量虽然有了大大的增加，但是仍然不能完全满足居民对于许多重要日用品的日益增长的需求。同时，有些贸易机构不正确地对各地区调拨商品，不考虑居民的需求，就把物品运到个别的地区。贸易机构在出售给居民的商品方面，常常没有对工业提出必要的严格的质量要求。没有充分做到利用地方性的原料来更广泛地发展商品生产，以使额外的货源进入商品流转之中。
    在对外贸易方面，苏联在一九五四年继续扩大与外国的经济联系。在去年，苏联和五十六个国家进行了贸易。
    八、职工数目的增加和劳动生产率的提高
    苏联国民经济中的职工数目到一九五四年年底约为四千七百万人，即比一九五三年年底增加二百万人。在工业、农业、建筑和运输业中，职工人数增加了一百七十万人。教育机构、科学研究机构、医疗机构、贸易机构、公共饮食企业、住宅公用事业这些方面的工作人员数目增加了。由于部分行政管理人员转业直接参加生产，机关工作人员的数量减少了。
    一九五四年和往年一样，全国没有失业的人。
    去年共有七十多万熟练工人从工厂附设学校、矿业学校、职业学校、铁路学校、矿业和专门职业学校、农业机械化职业学校、农业机械化学校毕业，并分配到工业、建筑、运输和农业工作中去，其中有三十三万人是农业中的机械操使干部。
    一九五四年，有七百七十万工人和职员通过个人——小组学习方法或训练班学习方式，提高了熟练程度和受专业训练。由于提高了劳动的技术装备和提高了工人的熟练程度，一九五四年工业的劳动生产率比一九五三年提高百分之七，建筑业的劳动生产率提高百分之八。苏联渔业部、苏联肉乳制品工业部没有能完成规定一九五四年提高工业劳动生产率的计划，冶金工业和化学工业企业建造部没有能完成规定一九五四年提高建筑业劳动生产率的计划。另外的各个部整个说来完成了提高劳动生产率计划，但是它们却有许多企业和建筑工程没有能完成自己的提高劳动生产率的计划。
    九、国民收入的增加和人民物质和文化生活水平的提高
    一九五四年人民的物质生活和文化生活水平有了进一步的提高。一九五四年苏联的国民收入比一九五三年增加了百分之十一。一九五四年实行的减低国家消费品零售价格，使居民得到了两百亿卢布的直接利益（按全年计算）。
    国民收入的增长、国家零售价格的减低和党和政府在农业方面所采取的措施，保证了工人、职员和农民收入的进一步增加。由于货币工资的提高和物价的降低，一年中工人和职员的实际工资增加了百分之五。
    由于一九五三年下半年和一九五四年在国家征购和收购农产品和减低赋税方面所实行的措施，集体农庄和农庄庄员的收入大大地增加了。集体农庄的财政状况加强了。一九五四年集体农庄存入农业银行中的不可分基金的存款增加了百分之三十五，在国家银行中的活期存款增加了百分之七十八。
    去年也像往年一样，居民从国家方面得到了补助金和职工的社会保险费用，社会保障养老金、多子女母亲和单身母亲的补助金、学生的奖学金、医疗补助费、免费和减费住疗养院和休养所的许可证、免费学习和提高业务水平的费用、其他许多方面的费用和减费与免费的待遇。此外，所有的职工都有为时至少两星期的假期，休假期间工资照发，有些行业的工作人员的假期还要长些。一九五四年，居民所得到的上述各项补助和减费及免费待遇共值一千四百六十亿卢布。
    总的说来，由于货币工资的增加、日用品价格的降低、农民货币收入和实物收入的增加、国家支出的费用和减免费的增加，工人、职员和农民一九五四年的总收入按比较价格计算，比一九五三年增加了百分之十一。
