Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 22nd dispatch: According to TASS, many prominent figures in West Germany have responded favorably to the Soviet government's statement on the German question.

Former Chancellor and Chairman of the League for German Unity, Peace, and Freedom, Josef Wirth, demanded "that no opportunity be missed to reach an agreement on the reunification of Germany," and believes that the Bonn government's rejection of the Soviet proposal for free elections in Germany is equivalent to "not needing any free elections at all."

Wirth also criticized the Bonn government's intention to miss the opportunity to establish normal relations with the Soviet Union. He said: "Perhaps the Federal Government is in such a dependent position that it cannot establish the relations with the East that the West German economy so urgently needs?"

Heinemenn, Chairman of the All-German People's Party and former Minister of the Interior in Bonn, spoke at a gathering in Karlsruhe, calling on people to be vigilant about the consequences of the policy of re-militarizing West Germany and demanding negotiations. He emphasized that the Western countries do not want to restore German unity, so the German people themselves must fight for the unity of their homeland.

Brockmann, Chairman of the West German Center Party, demanded that the Soviet government's proposals be carefully studied.

Lauschning, former President of the Danzig Senate, also believed that the Soviet proposals must be carefully studied. He emphasized that the question of German reunification can never be resolved by so-called "power politics." He said that the peaceful reunification of Germany is also a major contribution to the security of all peoples and the cause of world peace.

Many prominent figures in the West German Social Democratic Party have demanded negotiations on the basis of the Soviet proposals to restore German unity. For example, Federal Parliament member Mette Mann emphasized that the Allies must be forced to negotiate and seek an agreement. He pointed out that the implementation of the Paris Accords is fraught with the danger of causing civil war and an arms race among Germans.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 22nd dispatch: According to ADN Berlin on the 21st: The Chairman of the Free German Trade Union Federation, Warnke, delivered a radio address on the 20th, calling on West German workers and trade unionists to take unified action against the Paris Accords.

Warnke emphasized the threat of the Paris Accords to the lives and democratic rights of German workers. He believes that now is the time for consultations between the political parties and trade unions of German workers and discussions on joint measures against the revival of German militarism and to strive for the restoration of German unity. They should put forward a common demand for holding a referendum against the Paris Accords and for a unified Germany. They should discuss holding free all-German elections in 1955. Warnke said that the Free German Trade Union Federation is prepared to discuss all issues related to this with the West German Trade Union Federation and the political parties of the workers.

    自由德国工会联合会主席呼吁反对巴黎协定
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：西德许多著名人士对苏联政府关于德国问题的声明反应良好。
    前总理和德国人争取统一、和平与自由联盟主席约瑟夫·维尔特要求“不错过在重新统一德国问题上达成协议的任何机会”，并且认为波恩政府拒绝苏联关于在德国举行自由选举的建议就等于“根本不需要任何自由选举”。
    维尔特也批评波恩政府打算错过和苏联建立正常关系的机会。他说：“也许联邦政府处于如此的依赖地位，以致不能和东方建立西德经济如此迫切需要的关系？”
    全德人民党主席、波恩前内政部长海涅曼在加尔斯卢合的一个集会上讲话，叫人们警惕使西德重新军国主义化的政策的后果，并且要求举行谈判。他强调说：西方国家不希望恢复德国的统一，因此德国人民自己必须为他们的祖国的统一而斗争。
    西德中央党主席布罗克曼要求认真研究苏联政府的建议。
    前但泽参议院主席劳希宁也认为必须认真研究苏联的建议。他强调指出，德国重新统一的问题绝不可能用所谓“实力政策”来解决。他说：以和平方式重新统一德国同时也就是对各国人民的安全和世界和平事业的重大贡献。
    西德社会民主党的许多著名人士都要求在苏联建议的基础上谈判恢复德国统一的问题。例如，联邦议院议员梅特曼强调：必须迫使盟国谈判，求得协议。他指出：巴黎协定的执行充满着引起德国人之间的内战和军备竞赛的危险。
    【新华社二十二日讯】据德意志通讯社柏林二十一日讯：自由德国工会联合会主席瓦恩克二十日发表广播演说，呼吁西德工人和工会工作者采取统一行动，反对巴黎协定。
    瓦恩克强调指出巴黎协定对于德国工人的生活和民主权利的威胁。他认为：现在是德国工人的政党和工会之间进行协商和就反对复活德国军国主义和争取恢复德国的统一而采取联合措施进行讨论的时候了。它们应当提出举行反对巴黎协定和争取统一德国的公民投票的共同要求。他们应当讨论在一九五五年举行全德自由选举。瓦恩克说：自由德国工会联合会准备同西德工会联合会和工人的政党讨论有关这方面的一切问题。
