    National Grain Procurement Plan Successfully Completed
    Amount of Unified Purchased Grain Stored Reaches Seven-Tenths of Annual Plan
   [From Our Own Correspondent] Peasants in various regions enthusiastically deliver public grain and sell surplus grain, and the national public grain procurement and unified grain purchase work for the 1954-1955 year is progressing rapidly. By the end of 1954, the amount of public grain and unified purchased grain stored nationwide had reached 82.8 percent of the annual plan; among which the national public grain procurement plan has been successfully completed, and the amount of unified purchased grain stored reached 73.2 percent of the original plan.
    During this period, the amount of national public grain and unified purchased grain stored increased by 24 percent compared to the same period in 1953-1954; among which public grain increased by 18.6 percent and unified purchased grain increased by 28.4 percent. The state's grain inventory has therefore increased significantly. The grain inventory at the end of 1954 increased by 35.9 percent compared to the end of 1953.
