    At the Old Year Reception
    --New Year's Fantasy--
    De·Saslavski

    "The room was full of dead people... They were all dressed up: women with headscarves and ribbons, and men with official positions in full dress..."
                      (Pushkin: The Coffin Maker)

    French political figure Mr. Alphonse Padercoua had completed his New Year's speech. This was a speech he was supposed to deliver in front of the microphone at the famous International Club of Outgoing Ministers. The basic idea of the speech was simple and easy to understand. The basic idea was: only under the protection of the German Wehrmacht's bayonets can the national interests of France be protected. However, the wording to express this idea required an extraordinary skill. Therefore, after writing the last exclamation point, Alphonse Padercoua felt as tired as if he had been treading a tightrope for three hours straight. He had about two hours of free time, so he lay down on the sofa and took a nap...

    It was exactly eleven o'clock in the evening when Padercoua, his hair neatly combed, oiled, perfumed, and his collar stiffly starched, entered the brightly lit, guest-filled hall. Greetings, applause, and smiles greeted him as he nodded his head to the left and right, walking towards his seat on the honorary platform. He sat down, loosening the tails of his dress coat, and looked around, at which point he couldn't help but be surprised. He found the faces of the people sitting next to him so familiar...

    "Isn't this the devil!" Padercoua thought. "This person is Laval."

    He quickly turned his gaze to the right. Sitting next to him was none other than Mr. Chamberlain, as stiff as a rod, solemn and arrogant. Padercoua looked ahead. Ribbentrop was smiling warmly at him.

    Forestal was sitting in the chairman's armchair.

    "Am I dreaming?" Padercoua thought to himself. "Could I be dead?"

    Like most people in such situations, he pinched himself hard. No, he was not dead, nor was he dreaming. In fact, he wasn't very surprised, because he was a god-fearing and superstitious person, and he believed in miracles. He immediately guessed that he had arrived in the underworld, which was denied by atheists and materialists, but fully recognized by those who adhere to fixed ideologies. The great orator couldn't resist a frivolous action, and he even examined his fellow guests carefully with curiosity. Among them were his personal friends and like-minded people.

    Forestal tapped his glass with a knife, stood up, and said:

    "Ladies and gentlemen! We are gathered here to solemnly welcome nineteen thirty..."

    Padercoua thought the speaker had made a mistake, and he corrected him rather loudly:

    "Nineteen fifty-five, Mr. Forestal!"

    There was a commotion in the seats. People were smiling and whispering to each other. Padercoua's neighbor, Laval, said:

    "We forgive Mr. Padercoua's mistake. He is still living according to the concepts of another world! He has come here from that world. He does not know that we have a different era here. We are not moving forward, but backward. We do not welcome the New Year, but the Old Year."

    "But I'm not dead yet," Padercoua protested:

    "I'm not one of you yet."

    "You are one of us," Forestal said seriously. "We welcome you as one of us. Your New Year's speech confirms this. It's a truly excellent speech! I am happy to forgive you for quoting Laval extensively in your speech without indicating the source. Rather than plagiarism, it's more a matter of ideological consistency. Yes, he also said such things and also blessed the bayonets of the German Wehrmacht. Look at Ribbentrop. Would he resent Adenauer for plagiarizing his beautiful words about friendship with France? No, we all sincerely thank you, Mr. Padercoua. You are one of us, no matter how much you pinch yourself, you are one of us."

    "It's not worth thanking," Padercoua replied, although confused, but also somewhat feeling honored. "What have I done to earn your approval?"

    "You have restored our past alliance," Laval said.

    "You have revived the wonderful days when Ribbentrop and I sat around the table as intimately as we do now, vowing loyalty to each other. Mankind has slandered us. You, Padercoua, you have restored the honor of those who were called traitors and betrayers by the people of all countries. Historical events have separated us. You have restored our friendship."

    "Friendship!" Ribbentrop said mockingly. "What does my friend Mr. Chamberlain have to say about this?"

    The expression on the former British Prime Minister's face was calm. He said in a dry, croaking voice:

    "Loyalty to friendship and alliances is the golden rule of an English gentleman..."

    A rude burst of laughter interrupted him. Some were openly mocking, and others were smiling sarcastically. But this did not embarrass Chamberlain. After the laughter subsided, he remained calm and said:

    "This burst of rude laughter shows that the legends of the earthly world we have left behind have invaded our underworld. I know why my contemporaries are laughing and why my friend Ribbentrop is smiling so cunningly. Yes, I have also heard that one of my successors, on the one hand, vowed loyalty to his allies, and on the other hand, he issued an order to collect the weapons of the defeated German army in order to wage war against his allies. Those unfamiliar with British foreign policy call this treachery. However, my successor remained loyal to the enemy precisely because he betrayed his allies. Can you call this treachery, Mr. Ribbentrop?"

    Ribbentrop, after straightening the rope around his neck that served as a tie, said nonchalantly:

    "No. There may be little good will in this move, but the worst thing is that there is even less reason. Arming the remnants of the demoralized Wehrmacht is, first of all, a futile thing."

    "On the last night of my life," Laval mumbled, "before my head was taken off, I racked my brains for a long time on the question of what was our main and fatal mistake. I came to the conclusion that we inexcusably, most foolishly overestimated your strength, Mr. Ribbentrop."

    "Absolutely correct," Chamberlain said, "we trusted you, but you deceived us and fooled us. You showed not strength, but weakness."

    Ribbentrop shouted violently. The whole table erupted, and people began to quarrel.

    "Silence!" Forestal shouted sternly. "Please maintain the silence of the graveyard!"

    After the crowd fell silent, he said:

    "Listen to me. True, there are differences between us. But we should remember not what divides us, but what unites us. We are united in our common hatred of the Soviet people. However, unfortunately, historical experience has proven that this common feeling did not prevent you from fighting. There is another common feeling that unites us even more firmly. Let's be frank. We are all our own people here, and the Marxists who deny the spirit world cannot hear us. What we hate most is the people of our own countries. They are our main and common enemy. Frankly, who took your head, dear Laval? Not the Russians, but the French."

    "Damn the people!" Laval shouted viciously.

    "This is our common language," Forestal continued, "Damn the people! They ruin our plans, they constantly keep us in fear and danger, they threaten our profits, they deprive us of our peace. We draw up agreements—the people break them. We need war—but the people demand peace. As long as the people are alive, none of us can be sure of our own survival. The people must be eliminated—if it is impossible to eliminate them completely, then at least reduce their numbers."

    "That's a very good idea," Chamberlain said.

    "What we need is not a noisy, living, restless people," Forestal continued, "but quiet, silent dead people. The more dead people, gentlemen! As the saying goes, 'The dead catch the living.' Let us launch a crusade of the dead against the living. Go to the human world, Padercoua, as our envoy, as a herald of our revival, as an apostle of death and decay. Long live!"

    "Long live!" the dead cried wildly.

    They rushed to Padercoua, lifted him up, and shook him. They began to dance to the accompaniment of Saint-Saëns' "Danse Macabre" adapted into jazz. Padercoua's head was spinning, and his ears were buzzing...

    …The phone rang. It was a reminder that Alphonse Padercoua should go and speak into the microphone. An hour later, Padercoua, with his hair oiled and his collar starched stiff, began his speech:

    "Ladies and gentlemen! Congratulations on passing this already arrived nineteen thirty... sorry, I misspoke, nineteen fifty-five..."

    The newspapers believed that this strange mistake was due to the fluctuations in mood and fatigue of this outstanding speaker after suffering torment in parliament.

    在迎接旧年的会上
    ——新年的幻想——
    德·萨斯拉夫斯基
    “屋里挤满了死人……他们全都衣冠楚楚：女人蒙着头巾，系着丝带，有官职的男人都穿着大礼服……”
                      （普希金：棺材匠）
    法国政界要人阿尔丰斯·帕得库阿先生作完了新年演说的准备。这是一篇他应该在著名的卸任部长国际俱乐部的扩音机前发表的演说词。演说词的基本思想是简单而易懂的。基本思想就是：只有在德国国防军的刺刀保护下，才能保护法兰西的民族利益。但是表达这个意思的措词，却要求有一种不平凡的技艺。所以，在写完最后的一个感叹号之后，阿尔丰斯·帕得库阿感觉像连续不断地踩了三小时绷紧了的绳索那样疲倦。他还有两小时左右的空闲时间，于是他就倒在沙发上打了一会盹……。
    正是晚上十一点钟，头发梳得整整齐齐、擦了头油、洒了香水和衣领浆得挺硬的帕得库阿走进了灯光明亮、宾客满座的大厅。问候、掌声和微笑迎接了他，他左右点头答礼，走向荣誉席上自己的座位。他撂开礼服的复襟坐下来，周围扫视了一遍，那时他不禁惊讶起来了。他觉得邻座的面孔都熟悉得很哪……。
    “这不是见鬼吗！”帕得库阿思量着。“这个人是赖伐尔呀。”
    他很快地把视线转到右方去了。挨近他坐着的原来是像棍子一样直挺挺的、庄严傲慢的张伯伦先生。帕得库阿往前看了看。里宾特罗甫在对他亲热地微笑。
    在主席的安乐椅上坐着福莱斯特尔。
    “我不是在梦里吧？”帕得库阿暗忖着。“莫非我死了吗？”
    像一般人在这样的场合一样，他狠狠地拧了自己一下。不，他并没有死，也不是在梦里。其实，他也没有很惊奇，因为他是一个敬神信鬼的人，他相信有奇迹，他马上猜想他已来到了被无神论——唯物论者所否定的，但是被那些思想形态规矩的人们所完全认可的阴曹了。这位伟大的演说家也难免有轻浮的举动，于是他甚至怀着好奇的心情细细地端详他同席的邻座。他们中间有他个人的朋友和志同道合的人。
    福莱斯特尔用刀子敲打敲打玻璃杯，站起身说道：
    “诸位女士，诸位先生！我们聚会在这里，是为了隆重地迎接一九三……。”
    帕得库阿以为演说者说错了，他相当大声地修正道：
    “一九五五年，福莱斯特尔先生！”
    座位上起了骚动。人们在微笑和互相地窃窃私语。帕得库阿的邻人赖伐尔说道：
    “我们原谅帕得库阿先生的错误。他还依据另一个世界的概念而生活着呢！他就是从那个世界到我们这里来的。他不知道我们这里有着另外的纪元。我们不是向前进，而是向后退。我们不迎接新年，而是迎接旧年。”
    “可是我还没有死啊，”帕得库阿抗议说：
    “我还不是你们的人呢。”
    “您是我们的人”，福莱斯特尔严肃地说道。“我们把您当作我们的人来欢迎您。您的新年演说证实了这一点。真是一篇绝妙的演说！我乐意原谅您在演说里大量地引用赖伐尔的话，但不指出那些话的来源。与其说这是剽窃，毋宁说这是思想一致。是的，他也曾说这样的话，并且也曾这样祝福德国国防军的刺刀。您看看里宾特罗甫。难道他会因为阿登纳剽窃他的关于和法国亲睦的漂亮词句就恼恨阿登纳吗？不，我们一致衷心地感谢您，帕得库阿先生。您是我们的人，无论您怎样拧自己，您也是我们的人。”
    “不值得感谢，”虽然惶惑不安，但同时也多少感觉荣幸的帕得库阿回答了。“我因为什么而博得您的嘉许呢？”
    “您恢复了我们往昔的同盟，”赖伐尔说。
  “您使得往昔我和里宾特罗甫像现在这样亲热地围桌而坐、誓言彼此忠实的美妙的日子复活了。人类诬蔑了我们。您，帕得库阿，您恢复了那些被各国人民呼为叛徒、卖国贼的人们的荣誉。历史上的事变拆散了我们。您恢复了我们的友谊。”
    “友谊！”里宾特罗甫讥笑着说。“我的朋友张伯伦先生关于这一点有什么意见呢？”
    前英国首相脸上的表情是冷静的。他发出嘎嘎的枯燥声音说道：
    “忠实于友谊和同盟，这是英国绅士的金科玉律……。”
    不礼貌的哄堂大笑打断了他的话。有人在公然地嘲笑，有人在讥讽地微笑。但是这并没有使张伯伦难堪。等笑声平息之后，他依然冷静地说道：
    “这一阵不礼貌的笑声，说明我们已经抛离了的阳世上的传说侵入了我们的阴间。我知道和我同时代的人们为什么笑，为什么我的朋友里宾特罗甫那样狡狯地微笑。不错，我也曾听说，一位我的继任人，一方面对自己的同盟者誓言忠实，另一方面他却发出了收集被击溃了的德军的武器，以便对同盟者进行战争的命令。不谙英国外交政策的人们称此事为背信行为。可是，我的继任人正因为他背叛同盟者，才对敌人保持了忠实。您能说这是背信行为吗，里宾特罗甫先生？”
    里宾特罗甫整理了一下脖子上系着的代替领巾的绳子之后，满不在意地说道：
    “不能。在这个举动里好意固然很少，可是，最糟的是理智更少。武装士气沮丧的国防军的残余，这首先是毫无裨益的事。”
    “在我一生的最后一夜里，”赖伐尔嘟哝着说，“在我的脑袋还没有被取下之前，我在什么是我们的主要的和致命的错误这一问题上曾绞了很久的脑汁。我得出的结论是：我们不可原谅地、最最愚蠢地过高估计了你们的力量，里宾特罗甫先生。”
    “完全正确，”张伯伦说，“我们信任了你们，可是你们欺骗了我们，使我们上了当。你们表现出来的不是力量，而是软弱。”
    里宾特罗甫狂暴地叫起来了。全桌哗然，人们开始吵骂起来。
    “安静！”福莱斯特尔厉声喝道。“请保持墓地里的肃静！”
    众人沉默了之后，他说道：
    “你们听着。固然，在我们之间存在着分歧。但是我们应该记住的并不是分裂我们的东西，而是团结我们的东西。我们在仇恨苏联人民这一共同的感情上是一致的。不过，可惜，历史经验证明了这个共同的感情并未阻止你们打起架来。还有另外的，更牢固地团结我们的共同的感情。我们坦白地说好啦。这里全是自己人，否认有幽灵世界的马克思主义者们也听不见我们的话。我们最仇恨的是我们本国的人民。他们是我们的主要的和共同的敌人。老实讲，谁夺去了您的脑袋，亲爱的赖伐尔？不是俄国人，而是法国人。”
    “该死的人们！”赖伐尔恶狠地喊道。
      “这就是我们的共同的语言，”福莱斯特尔继续说，“人民该死！他们破坏我们的计划，他们使我们经常耽惊耽险，他们威胁我们的利润，他们剥夺我们的安宁。我们拟订协定——人民破坏它们。我们需要战争——人民却要求和平。在人民还活着的时候，我们中间谁也不敢确信自己能活下去。必须把人民消灭——如果不可能完全消灭，那么，起码也要减少他们的人数。”
    “这真是善哉、妙哉的主意，”张伯伦说。
    “我们需要的不是吵吵闹闹的、活生生的、不安静的人民，”福莱斯特尔继续说，“而是安静的、默默无言的死人。死人要多一些，先生们！俗言道得好，‘死人捉活人’。我们对活人发动死人的十字军进军吧。您到人间去，帕得库阿，作为我们的使者，作为我们复活的报信人，作为死亡和腐朽的使徒。万岁！”
    “万岁！”死人们狂叫起来。
    他们涌向帕得库阿，把他抬起，摇荡他。他们开始了在改编成爵士乐的圣桑的“死神之舞”的伴奏下跳舞。帕得库阿的头晕了，在他的耳朵里边嗡嗡地鸣起来了……。
    ……电话铃响起了。这是提醒阿尔丰斯·帕得库阿应该去对着播音器讲话。一小时以后，擦了头油和衣领挺硬的帕得库阿开始了演说：
    “女士和先生们！恭贺你们过这已经到临的一九三……对不起，说错了，一九五五年……”
    报纸认为这一奇怪的错误是由于这位卓越的演说家在议会上遭受折磨之后心绪波动和疲惫而发生的。
