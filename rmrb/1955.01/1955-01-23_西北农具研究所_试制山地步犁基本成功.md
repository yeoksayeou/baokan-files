    Northwest Agricultural Implement Research Institute
    Trial Production of Mountain Walking Plow Basically Successful
    The Northwest Agricultural Implement Research Institute's trial production of the No. 16 mountain walking plow has achieved basic success.

    Last year, the institute trial-produced 130 No. 16 mountain walking plows and sent them to sixteen provinces, including Shaanxi and Gansu, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region for extensive trial plowing. According to the results of trials in various regions, with the exception of some mountainous areas in East and Central South China with heavy clay soil, most mountain farmers welcomed them. During trial plowing in the Dayou Mountain area of ​​Huangzhong County, Qinghai Province, farmers saw that the mountain walking plow tilled the land quickly and evenly. At that time, eight mutual aid groups and six individual farmers requested to order them. After extensive trials in the Tianshui area of ​​Gansu Province, mountain farmers flocked to local supply and marketing cooperatives to order goods, requesting supplies, and it is estimated that several thousand units are needed. Therefore, the Northwest Agricultural Implement Research Institute decided to trial-produce another 400 units in the first quarter of this year and also help the Tianshui area agricultural implement factory in Gansu Province carry out trial production work.

    西北农具研究所
    试制山地步犁基本成功
    西北农具研究所试制十六号山地步犁，已获得基本成功。
    去年该所试制了一百三十部十六号山地步犁后，即发往陕西、甘肃等十六个省及内蒙古自治区进行广泛试犁。各地试用结果，除华东、中南部分土质粘性重的山区不适用外，大部分山区农民都很欢迎。在青海省湟中县大有山区进行试犁时，农民看到山地步犁耕的地又快又平，当时就有八个互助组和六户单干农民要求订购。甘肃省天水专区经过广泛试用后，山区农民纷纷向当地供销合作社订货，要求供应，估计需要数量约有数千部。因此，西北农具研究所决定在今年第一季度再试制四百部，并帮助甘肃天水专区农具厂也进行试制工作。
