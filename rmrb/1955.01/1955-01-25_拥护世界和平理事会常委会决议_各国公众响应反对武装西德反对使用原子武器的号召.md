Xinhua News Agency, January 24th: According to TASS, the declaration and appeal regarding opposing the remilitarization of West Germany and opposing the use of atomic weapons, recently adopted by the enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, have received widespread attention and support from public organizations and public opinion in many countries.

    Chairman of the Mongolian Peace Protection Committee, Silindiib, said: The declaration of the Vienna meeting shows a powerful force sufficient to prevent new wars. The working people in all parts of Mongolia are holding meetings to discuss and fully support the declaration of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council. The Mongolian Peace Protection Committee is working to promote the resolutions of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council among the broad masses of the people.

    The Hungarian newspaper published a letter from the Presidium of the Hungarian National Peace Council to Hungarian peace advocates on the 23rd. The letter pointed out: The declaration of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council puts forward a significant task for the Hungarian people. The letter calls on peace advocates to collect millions of signatures throughout the country, making this movement a powerful popular vote against the dark forces plotting atomic war.

    Romania's "Spark" published an editorial stating that this meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council is of extremely significant importance to the struggle of the people of all countries to defend peace. It reflects the aspirations of the people of all countries, and hundreds of millions of people will respond to the call to launch a large-scale signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons.

    Czechoslovakia's "Red Rights" published an editorial stating that due to the policies of some Western countries' governments to prepare for atomic war and revive the West German Defense Force, the danger faced by the people of all countries has deepened. However, on the question of peace or war, the power of decision is in the hands of the broad masses of the people.

    "Austrian People's Voice" published an editorial stating that handing atomic weapons to Hitler's generals would be a fatal danger to Austria. The Austrian people must do everything possible to oppose the preparation for new wars using atomic weapons and oppose the rearmament of West Germany.

    Finland's "New Times" welcomed the "Letter to the People of the World" from the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, commenting: The Stockholm Declaration, which declared atomic weapons illegal, once prevented the organizers of the aggression against Korea from daring to use atomic bombs. At present, the people of all countries will also not allow adventurers to play with the fate of all mankind. The call of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council will launch a massive movement that cannot be stopped by anything. Our people will do everything possible to make those who clamor for atomic war wake up.

    Sweden's "New Daily" commented: "The 'Letter to the People of the World' and the 'Letter to the People of Europe' "emphasize that the threat of atomic war and the danger from German militarism are very closely linked; and point out that the struggle for peace should be carried out simultaneously with the struggle against the threat of atomic war and against the plan to rearm West Germany."

    拥护世界和平理事会常委会决议
    ——各国公众响应反对武装西德反对使用原子武器的号召
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社讯：世界和平理事会常务委员会扩大会议最近通过的关于反对西德重新军国主义化、反对使用原子武器的宣言和号召，受到许多国家公众组织和舆论的广泛注意和拥护。
    蒙古保卫和平委员会主席锡林迪布说：维也纳会议的宣言显示了足以阻止新战争的强大力量。蒙古各地的劳动人民正在纷纷举行集会，讨论并且完全拥护世界和平理事会常务委员会的宣言。蒙古保卫和平委员会正在展开工作，在广大人民群众中宣传世界和平理事会常务委员会的决议。
    匈牙利报纸二十三日刊载了匈牙利全国和平理事会主席团致匈牙利和平拥护者的一封信。信中指出：世界和平理事会常务委员会的宣言向匈牙利人民提出了重大的任务。信中号召和平拥护者在全国各地征集成百万个签名，让这个运动成为反对策划原子战争的黑暗势力的强大的人民投票。
    罗马尼亚“火花报”发表社论说，世界和平理事会常务委员会这一次会议对于各国人民保卫和平的斗争有极其重大的意义。它反映了各国人民的愿望，亿万人民将响应关于发动大规模的反对使用原子武器的签名运动的号召。
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”发表社论说，由于一些西方国家的政府推行准备原子战争和复活西德国防军的政策，各国人民面临的危险加深了。但是，对于和平还是战争的问题，决定权是掌握在广大人民群众的手中的。
      “奥地利人民之声报”发表社论说，把原子武器交给希特勒将领，对奥地利来说将是一个致命的危险。奥地利人民必须尽力反对准备使用原子武器的新战争，反对重新武装西德。
    芬兰“新时报”对世界和平理事会常务委员会
  “告全世界人民书”表示欢迎，它评论道：宣布原子武器为非法的斯德哥尔摩宣言曾经使侵略朝鲜的组织者一直不敢使用原子弹。在目前，世界各国人民也是不会允许冒险分子来玩弄全人类的命运的。世界和平理事会常务委员会的号召将发起一个为任何东西都不能阻挡的声势浩大的运动。我国人民将尽一切力量使叫嚣原子战争的人们清醒过来。
    瑞典“新日报”评论说：“告全世界人民书”和“告欧洲人民书”中“着重指出，原子战争的威胁和来自德国军国主义方面的危险有着非常密切的联系；并且指出，争取和平的斗争应该同反对原子战争的威胁、反对重新武装西德的计划的斗争同时进行。”
