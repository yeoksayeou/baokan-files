    Happiness is Not Obtained by Waiting
    Zhong Xia
    “The Soviet Union’s today is our tomorrow,” is a saying often used when conducting socialist propaganda and education among the masses. Most of the masses understand this sentence. However, what was the Soviet Union's "yesterday" like? How did the happy "today" come about through the arduous struggle of "yesterday" and "the day before yesterday"? The masses understand very little about this. This is a major shortcoming in the current propaganda work in rural areas. It is necessary to propagate the happiness of socialism to the peasants, but this propaganda must have the effect of inspiring the masses to rise up and fight for this happiness, and use the power of the masses to overcome all difficulties on the road ahead.
    When some comrades propagate socialism to the peasants, they start with "Upstairs and downstairs, electric lights and telephones," and end with "No oil needed for lighting, no cattle needed for plowing." They do not explain, in combination with the specific ideas of the peasants, how such a life can be realized, or what specific connections exist between the socialist vision and the various measures currently being taken for socialism. As a result of such propaganda, the peasants feel that a happy life is within easy reach; once they encounter some difficulties in real life, doubts and even confusion arise in their minds.
    For example, the system of unified purchase and sales is a socialist measure that is beneficial to the peasants, but when this measure requires the peasants to change some of their living habits, some peasants inevitably develop resistance and express doubt about the bright future of socialism.
    Some rural work cadres do not understand that the socialist transformation of agriculture should be carried out in two steps; some people know that it should be carried out in two steps, but cannot explain how to do it. Some people, based on their "experience" in the past two years, tell the peasants: "In the first year, the general line is proposed, in the second year, cooperativization is realized, and then mechanization should follow." Some people say when mobilizing peasants to join the cooperative: "Tractors are coming soon. If you don't join the cooperative, the scattered plots will have to be exchanged to the cooperative. See what you will do!" Some peasants, fearing that their land would be taken away and that they would not be able to use the tractors when they came, joined the cooperative in a muddle. Many people, after listening to this kind of propaganda, mistakenly believe that large-scale mechanization is only a matter of two or three years. Peasants in Huining and other villages in Xingtai, Hebei Province, are not only unwilling to buy new-style farm tools, but even unwilling to add or repair old-style farm tools. They say: Let's just make do with them! In two or three years, we will have tractors. What's the point of buying these old things? This not only causes a great deviation in the peasants' understanding of cooperativization, but also creates a mood of contempt for the current reform of agricultural technology, such as the use of new-style animal-powered farm tools.
    We cannot treat the future as the present. We must start from the present to create the future. Without enduring some hardships today, we can never create happiness tomorrow. Peasants should obey the national plan, strive to develop mutual aid and cooperation, improve agricultural production, and support national industrial construction; only when industry develops, and tractors and gasoline are produced in large quantities, can industry more powerfully support agriculture, and agriculture can develop faster. At that time, the beautiful vision can become a reality. Sitting and waiting for happiness will never come. Cherries are delicious, but you have to plant the trees well first.

    幸福不是坐等得来的
    仲夏
    “苏联的今天就是我们的明天”，这是向群众进行社会主义的宣传教育时常说的一句话。大部分群众都了解了这句话。可是，苏联的“昨天”是什么样子？幸福的“今天”是经过怎样艰苦奋斗的“昨天”“前天”才来到的？群众了解的就很少了。这是当前在农村进行宣传工作的一个很大的缺点。向农民宣传社会主义的幸福是必要的，但必须使这种宣传发生这样的作用：鼓舞群众为得到这种幸福起而战斗，用群众的力量战胜前进道路上的一切困难。
    有些同志向农民宣传社会主义时，开口是“楼上楼下，电灯电话”，闭口是“点灯不用油，犁地不用牛”。对于怎样才能实现这样的生活，社会主义的远景和眼前为了社会主义而进行的各种措施有些什么具体联系，却没有结合农民的具体思想加以解释。这样宣传的结果，就使农民觉得幸福生活是伸手就能得到的；在现实生活中一旦碰到一些困难，思想上就会发生疑虑甚至混乱。
    如实行统购统销本来是对农民有利的社会主义措施，但这种措施要求农民改变一些生活习惯的时候，有些农民就不免发生抵触情绪，对于社会主义的美好前途也表示将信将疑。
    有些农村工作干部不懂得完成农业社会主义改造要分两步走；有些人虽知道要分两步走，却说不清到底怎样走法。有些人就根据自己这两年来的“体验”，对农民说：“头一年提出总路线，第二年实现合作化，紧接着就该机械化了。”有的人在动员农民入社时说：“眼看拖拉机就来了，你不入社，插花地都得换给社里，看你怎么办！”有些农民怕换走自己的地，又怕拖拉机来了自己使不上，就糊里糊涂入了社。不少人听了这种宣传，错误地以为大规模机械化也不过是三年两载的事。河北省邢台会宁等村农民不仅不愿置买新式农具，就连旧式农具也不愿添置修补。他们说：对付着使吧！三、二年就有了拖拉机，置买这些旧家伙干啥呢？这样，不仅使农民对合作化的了解发生极大偏差，而且对当前的农业技术的改革，如使用新式畜力农具等，产生了轻视的情绪。
    我们不能把将来当成现在，我们要从现在出发创造将来。不忍受今天的一些艰苦，绝不能创造明天的幸福。农民们应该服从国家计划，努力发展互助合作，提高农业生产，支援国家工业建设；只有工业发展了，拖拉机和汽油大量生产出来了，工业才能更有力地支援农业，农业才能更快地发展。那时候，美好远景才能变成现实。坐着等幸福，是一辈子也等不来的。樱桃固然好吃，先要好好栽树才行。
