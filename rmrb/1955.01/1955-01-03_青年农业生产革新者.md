    Young Agricultural Production Innovator
    Yutian
    In mid-November, the Luoding County area of Guangdong Province was in the midst of a tense autumn harvest season. Many farmers, despite the hard work of this busy season, traveled to Tianbian Village, Shangchi Township, Luoding County. Yang Minghan, a member of the Youth League in Tianbian Village, had cultivated many new varieties of crops, greatly increasing yields. This fact attracted them to the village.

    "Working for the Vast Majority"
    In 1950, Yang Minghan was still a junior high school student. On Youth Day, May Fourth, he went to the classroom to listen to his Chinese language teacher lecture on Lesson One of Book Four. Opening the book, he saw that the title was "The Direction of Youth," written by Comrade Chen Boda. "The Direction of Youth?" Yang Minghan thought, "What's it all about?" He listened intently during the lesson. He felt that the first paragraph was the best, that the direction of youth was to "work for the vast majority." This was very new to him; he had never heard anything like this when studying in the old society.

    But, "working for the vast majority," doing what kind of work? "Being a worker, a teacher, a cadre?..." Yang Minghan thought for a long time, but it always felt vague and uncertain.

    Learning from Michurin
    Yang Minghan was the son of a farmer. He had participated in agricultural labor since he was twelve years old. Later, his teachers and classmates at the middle school knew that he loved agricultural labor and encouraged him to study agricultural technology. In the second half of that year, he was admitted to an agricultural technical school.

    He saw a story about Michurin in a magazine, which fascinated him.

    "Michurin is truly an amazing person!" Yang Minghan thought. "He saw that Russian agriculture was very backward, but he was not discouraged by this. He did hundreds of experiments, failed, and started again, finally succeeding. He received the highest praise from the Soviet Party, government, and people, and congratulations from Lenin and Stalin. But he still felt that what he had done was only a part of the whole people's cause, and the rest had to be done by the youth!"

    "I want to be such a young person!" Yang Minghan said to himself. He firmly remembered Michurin's famous saying: "We cannot sit and wait for the gifts of nature, we should take from nature."

    Setting an Example to Convince the Masses
    In the winter of 1951, Yang Minghan had to suspend his studies and return home due to a brain illness. For someone who had just found his ideal and career, this was undoubtedly a most painful thing. Yang Minghan did not feel pain because of this. He thought, "I'll just start my career early."

    The spring plowing of 1952 began. Tianbian Village presented a beautiful picture before Yang Minghan's eyes. He returned to the fields he knew so well. His family of five had only 3.9 mu of land. This was a semi-mountainous area, and land reform had not yet been completed in 1952. Therefore, the annual yield of arable land was very low, averaging only 460 jin per mu. This was hardly enough to eat. Yang Minghan's family was a little better off, but the neighboring farmers were even more difficult, and could only drink salt porridge every day. Low yield, hard life, what to do? Yang Minghan used the little scientific knowledge he had learned to fight the land. At first, he followed the principle that "to make crops grow well, the first step is to pay attention to nurturing seedlings" and improved the seedbeds in his home. He found that in the past, sowing 30 jin of grain in 1 fen of land was too dense, and it would be best to change it to 15 jin. He went to mobilize his mother, but was opposed by her. His mother still sowed the seeds according to the old method. Later, he used the principles of "small seedlings, dense planting" and "full utilization of land fertility" and Chen Yongkang's experience in high yields in Jiangsu to publicize to the masses, but no one paid attention to him. These things made Yang Minghan deeply realize that farmers are the most practical, and it is impossible to convince them without setting an example for everyone to see. Therefore, although he could not be exposed to the sun due to his brain illness, he reluctantly insisted on planting 0.608 mu of land in his own field using dense planting methods. Then he thought of some ways to accumulate green manure and adopted reasonable technical management methods. As a result, this year, the yield of this field was more than 800 jin per mu, about twice as high as usual. This convinced the farmers. In the 1953 evaluation campaign, his family was the first to be rated as a "high-yield household." Soon, the village began to organize mutual aid groups, and these advanced technologies were widely adopted. Due to the organization and the promotion of new technologies, the yield increased greatly, and the farmers began to become wealthy: Yang Minghan's family sold 1,700 jin of surplus grain in 1953.

    Difficulties Do Not Scare Innovators
    Yang Minghan was not only improving old farming techniques, but also studying new scientific technologies. In June 1952, he crossed the local superior rice varieties "Fanluobai" and "Xinyibai." This was an experiment based on Michurin's principles of hybridization breeding. At first, he did not understand many techniques and methods. When studying at school, he only knew that he had to emasculate with silver needles; now that he didn't have silver needles, what should he do? Sometimes, in order to solve these technical and methodological difficulties, he persisted in studying until late at night. Later, he ran to the county cultural center, and finally found a way in a "Soviet Agricultural Science" magazine: Lysenko's "wheat hot water emasculation method." He was very happy at the time. But after returning home, he thought that Lysenko was experimenting with wheat, would it work for rice? Where could he find a thermometer, a timer, and a thermos bottle? It seemed that the experiment would be difficult to carry out. But difficulties did not scare him. He tried everything he could: he borrowed a "fever thermometer" from a nearby doctor, brought a charcoal stove and a cooking pot from his home to the field to boil water, and asked his younger brother Yang Yutian to watch the clock at home. Finally, he started the experiment in the field. The first time, he used Lysenko's method completely: 38 degrees Celsius for 10 minutes. But it failed. It was not until the third time at 42 degrees that a few grains were infertile. Immediately afterwards, he used 43 degrees, 44 degrees, 45 degrees... and repeated the experiment many times, finally concluding that 43 to 45 degrees Celsius for 10 minutes was the most suitable. This year, he finally harvested dozens of first-generation hybrid rice seeds.

    "Grain is the Most Important"
    On February 27, 1953, Yang Minghan came to the District People's Government with a string of new corn seeds. The deputy district chief asked him: "How did you get your new corn seeds?"

    "I bought some Beijing corn seeds in April and May of the year before, crossed them with local corn seeds, and then interbred them last year. The yield is two to three times higher than the local average."

    "What other experiments have you done?"

    "Artificial pollination of pumpkins. In the past, a gourd only bore one or two gourds; some people say that if someone points a finger at a pumpkin flower when it blooms, it will not bear fruit. I don't believe in this superstitious saying. I found that some female flowers do not receive pollen; after artificial pollination, each gourd vine can bear six or seven gourds. There is also rice hybridization..."

    "How did you think of doing these experiments?"

    "To use facts to prove the correctness of Michurin's science..."

    "You did the right thing!" The deputy district chief said excitedly after listening to him. "The new corn seeds and the artificial pollination method for pumpkins can be promoted to the entire district immediately. I hope you will continue to persevere with the rice experiment. We will help you solve any difficulties. Experiments should not only be to prove science, but for the needs of the Party and the people. You know, at present, solving the grain problem is the most important thing in our mountainous area."

    Continue to Advance in the Direction Indicated by the Party
    After Yang Minghan returned from the district, he felt a new strength in himself. "The grain problem is the most important!" This sentence has taken root deep in his heart. After 1953, he more carefully cultivated the second and third generations after the hybridization of "Fanluobai" and "Xinyibai." According to the appraisal of rice expert Ding Ying, president of South China Agricultural College, the third generation is very likely to become a new variety. This new variety can bear 290 to 300 grains per ear, more than twice as many as the original variety "Fanluobai," and one and a half to two times more than "Xinyibai."

    However, Yang Minghan was not satisfied with this; he also had a grand ideal. He hopes to be able to derive a superior variety of "one thousand grains per ear" in future experiments. In the summer of 1954, he also crossed wild barnyard grass with the third generation of the new variety. Each ear already has more than 500 grains, with the highest reaching about 537 grains.

    Now, Yang Minghan's career and ideal of "working for the vast majority" has begun to be realized. However, Yang Minghan said: "What has been done now is still very little. If I had not grown up in the new China, without the leadership and help of the Party, even this little achievement would have been impossible. In the future, I must continue to advance in the direction indicated by the Party."

    青年农业生产革新者
    于田
    十一月中旬，在广东省罗定县一带地方，正是紧张的秋收季节。许多农民在这农忙季节，不辞劳苦跑到罗定县上池乡田边村。田边村青年团员杨明汉培育了许多农作物的新品种，大大提高了产量。这个事实吸引着他们到这个村子里来。
    “为绝大多数人做工”
    一九五○年，杨明汉还是个初中学生。正是“五四”青年节那天，他走进教室去听国文教师讲第四册第一课。打开书一看，题目叫“青年人的方向”，是陈伯达同志写的。“青年人的方向？”杨明汉想，“里边尽讲些什么呢？”上课的时候，他聚精会神地听着。他觉得头一段讲得最好，青年人的方向就是要“为绝大多数人做工”。这在他来说，是很新鲜的，以前在旧社会读书就从来没有讲过这样的事。
    但是，“为绝大多数人做工”，做什么工呢？“做工人，当教师，当干部？……”杨明汉想了很久，总是感到模模糊糊，捉摸不定。
      学习米丘林
    杨明汉是农民子弟。他从十二岁起就参加农业劳动。以后中学的教师和同学知道他热爱农业劳动，都鼓励他去学农业技术。这年下半年，他就考进了农业技术学校。
    他在一本杂志上看到了关于米丘林的故事，这可把他吸引住了。
    “米丘林真是个了不起的人！”杨明汉想，“他看到俄国农业非常落后，但并没有因此气馁。他做了上百次的试验，失败了，又重新做，最后终于成功了。他受到了苏联党、政府和人民最高的褒奖，得到列宁、斯大林的祝贺。但他还感到自己所做的只是整个人民事业的一部分，其余的还要靠青年人来做！”
    “我就要做这样的青年人！”杨明汉对自己说。他牢牢地记住了米丘林的名言：“我们不能坐待大自然的恩赐，我们应当向大自然索取。”
    做出样子来说服群众
      一九五一年冬，杨明汉因患脑病休学回家。这对于一个刚刚找到自己的理想和事业的人，不能说不是一件最痛苦的事。杨明汉并没有因此感到痛苦。他想：“我就提早开始我的事业好了。”
      一九五二年春耕开始了。田边村在杨明汉的眼前，展现出一副美丽的图画。他又回到了自己所熟悉的田畦。他家里五口人，只有三亩九分多田。这里是半山区，一九五二年又还没有完成土地改革，因此，耕地年产量很低，平均每亩只产四百六十斤。这那里够吃呢？杨明汉家里还好一点，附近的农民就更困难，每天只能用盐泡粥喝。产量低，生活苦，怎么办呢？杨明汉就凭着自己学到的一点点科学知识，和土地斗争起来。一开始，他按照“要使作物生长良好，头一步就要注意养育秧苗”的道理，去改进家里所作的秧田。他发现过去一分田撒种谷三十斤太密，如果改为十五斤就最好。他去动员他的母亲，遭到了母亲的反对。他母亲还是按老办法撒了种。后来，他又运用“小株密植”、“充分利用地力”的道理和江苏陈永康的丰产经验，向群众宣传，也没有人理睬他。这些事，使杨明汉深深体会到：农民是最实际的，不做出样子来给大家看是不行的。因此，他虽然因为脑病不能出来晒太阳，还是勉强坚持着在自己的田里用密植的方法插了六分零八厘田。接着又想了些积绿肥的办法，采用了合理的技术管理办法。结果，这一年，这块田的产量合每亩八百多斤，比一般的高出一倍左右。这一下可把农民说服了。在一九五三年评比运动中，他家头一个被评为“丰产户”。不久，村里开始组织互助组，这些先进的技术就大量被采用了。由于组织起来，又推广了新技术，产量大大增加，农民们开始富裕起来了：杨明汉家一九五三年就卖了一千七百斤余粮。
    困难吓不倒革新者
    杨明汉一方面在改进旧的耕作技术，另方面又在钻研新的科学技术。一九五二年六月，他用本地的优良水稻品种“饭罗白”和“信宜白”进行了杂交。这是根据米丘林的杂交育种的原理进行的一种试验。开始的时候，很多技术、方法都不懂。在学校学习时，只知道要用银针去雄；现在自己没有银针，怎么办呢？有时候，为了解决这些技术、方法上的困难，他坚持学习直到深夜。后来，他跑到县文化馆去，在一本“苏联农业科学”杂志上终于找到了办法：李森科的“小麦温水去雄法”。当时他是很高兴的。但回家以后一想，李森科试验的是小麦，水稻行不行呢？温度计、计时的表、暖水瓶到那里去找呢？看样子，试验是很难进行了。但是困难并没有把他吓倒。他想尽了一切办法：向附近的医生借了一个“探热计”，用家里的木炭火炉和做饭用的瓦煲带到田里烧水，又请弟弟杨玉田在家里看钟，最后终于在田里开始试验了。第一次完全是用李森科的方法：摄氏三十八度，十分钟。但是失败了。直到第三次用四十二度，才有几粒不结实了。紧接着又用四十三度，四十四度，四十五度……反复进行了许多次试验，最后得出结论：在摄氏四十三度到四十五度，浸十分钟，最合适。这一年，他终于收存了几十粒第一次杂交的水稻新种子。
    “粮食是最主要的”
    一九五三年二月二十七日，杨明汉提着一串玉米新种来到了区人民政府。副区长问他：“你的玉米新种是怎么得来的呢？”
    “这是前年四、五月买了一些北京玉米种，和本地的玉米种杂交，到去年又进行了品内杂交得来的。产量比本地一般的高出两倍到三倍。”
      “你还进行了些什么试验呢？”
    “南瓜的人工授粉。以往一棵瓜只结一两个瓜；有人说：南瓜开花时，哪个花有人用手指过，就不结瓜了。我不信这种迷信的说法。我发现是有些雌花受不到花粉；经过人工授粉以后，每棵瓜藤可以结六、七个瓜。还有水稻杂交……。”
    “你怎么会想起做这些试验呢？”
    “为了用事实来证实米丘林科学的正确……。”
    “你做得对！”副区长听完了他的话，兴奋地说。“玉米新种和南瓜的人工授粉法，马上就可以向全区推广。水稻的试验，希望你继续坚持下去。有困难我们帮助你解决。试验不能只是为了证实科学，而是为了党和人民的需要。你知道，目前在我们山区，解决粮食问题是最主要的。”
      按照党指示的方向继续前进
    杨明汉从区上回来后，感到自己身上有了一股新的力量。“粮食问题是最主要的！”这句话已经在他的心里深深地生了根。一九五三年以后，他更加细心地培育了“饭罗曰”和“信宜白”杂交后的第二代，第三代。根据水稻专家、华南农学院院长丁颕的鉴定：第三代已很可能成为一种新品种。这种新品种每穗的粒子可结实二百九十粒到三百多粒，比原品种“饭罗白”高出一倍多，比“信宜白”高出一倍半到两倍多。
    但是，杨明汉并没有以此为满足，他还有一个远大的理想。他希望在今后的试验中，能得出一种“一穗千粒”的优良品种。一九五四年夏天，他又用野草稗子和新品种第三代进行了杂交，每穗的粒子已有五百多粒，最高约达到了五百三十七粒。
    现在，杨明汉“为绝大多数人做工”的事业和理想开始实现了。但是，杨明汉说：“现在所做的还很少。如果不生长在新中国，没有党的领导和帮助，就是这一点点成绩也是不可能的。今后，我一定要按照党所指示的方向继续前进。”
