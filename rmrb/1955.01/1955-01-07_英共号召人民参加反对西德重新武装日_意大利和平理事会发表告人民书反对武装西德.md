Xinhua News Agency, London, 6th. TASS reports: The British Communist Party is holding a series of meetings to unite the British working class in the struggle against the preparation for a new war.

    Speaking at one such meeting held by the East Anglia party organization on January 4th, British Communist Party General Secretary Harry Pollitt emphasized that the communists in East Anglia must always remember that they live in "an occupied area." In their own land, the British have many opportunities to understand the American way of life.

    Pollitt pointed out that all upright British people want to eliminate American military bases, withdraw atomic bombers and American soldiers from their country.

    Pollitt called on the British people to strongly protest the decision made at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting on December 18, 1954, regarding the use of atomic and hydrogen bombs. He said that the NATO meeting assumed from the outset that these weapons would be used, and that in fact, American militarists have the right to decide when and where to use these weapons.

    Pollitt called for strengthening the struggle against the rearmament of West Germany. He pointed out that the struggle against the rearmament of West Germany is not over, and the people of the world still hold the final say and can still defeat the war plan. He said: "What is urgently needed now is for the people to demand that the British Parliament reopen the debate on the London and Paris Accords when it opens on January 25th. Before that day, the Labour Party should convene a special meeting to reconsider its policy on the issue of German rearmament."

    Pollitt called on all communists to actively participate in the national Anti-West German Rearmament Day scheduled for January 25th—the opening day of the British Parliament.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 6th. TASS reports: The Italian National Peace Council has issued an appeal to the Italian people, calling on them to oppose the arming of West Germany and the threat of atomic war.

    The appeal to the people stated: "Recent events in international life have demonstrated the deepening danger of war in Europe and the world, and have presented a new and urgent task to peace fighters and all citizens who do not want to see our country dragged into a world war that leads to destruction."

    The appeal pointed out that this task is: to shatter the destructive plans of arming West Germany and using atomic weapons to massacre people.

    The appeal also pointed out: The arming of West Germany and atomic war are not inevitable. The votes of the French Republic Senate and the Italian Senate may still overturn the plan to arm the West German "Bundeswehr". The results of the people's struggle show that there is currently a way to effectively prevent the arming of West Germany. Now, before the Senate begins debating the London and Paris Accords, every citizen has the right and the obligation to ask every member of the House of Representatives and the Senate to report on their voting situation, to ask who they voted or will vote for; to ask whether they are in favor of or against the arming of West Germany, in favor of war or in favor of peace. At mass rallies to be held throughout Italy from January 16th to 23rd, thousands of representatives who have visited parliamentarians will publicly report on the reasons for the parliamentarians' votes.

    The appeal continued: Now is the most responsible moment for each of us. Therefore, scientists should use all their prestige to point out the dangers inherent in atomic war. Cultural workers should point out the threat of the arrival of a new barbaric era. Political activists should say: "No to the Paris Accords which aim to arm West Germany and divide Europe."

    The appeal called: The Italian people and the people of the world should unite and block the path to the revival of German militarism!

    英共号召人民参加反对西德重新武装日
    意大利和平理事会发表告人民书反对武装西德
   【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社伦敦五日讯：英国共产党正召开一系列的会议，来团结英国工人阶级进行反对准备新战争的斗争。
    英国共产党总书记哈里·波立特在英吉利东部党组织一月四日举行的这样一次会议上发言时强调说，英格兰东部的共产党人必须时时记住他们是住在“一个被占领的地区内”。英国人在英国的土地上，有许多机会来了解美国生活方式。
    波立特指出，一切正直的英国人都希望从他们的国土上取消美国军事基地，撤走原子轰炸机和美国兵。
    波立特号召英国人民强烈抗议一九五四年十二月十八日北大西洋公约组织会议关于使用原子弹和氢弹的决定。他说，北大西洋公约组织会议从一开始就认为，这些武器将会使用的，而且实际上美国军国主义分子们有权决定在什么时候和在什么地方使用这些武器。
    波立特号召加强反对重新武装西德的斗争。他指出，反对重新武装西德的斗争还没有结束，全世界的人民仍然握有最后决定权，仍然可以击败战争计划。他说：“目前迫切需要的是：人民要求英国议会在一月二十五日开幕时重新就伦敦和巴黎协定举行辩论。在那一天以前，工党应该召开特别会议来重新考虑工党对德国重新武装问题的政策。”
    波立特号召一切共产党人积极参加定于一月二十五日——英国议会开幕日——举行的全国反对西德重新武装日。
   【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社罗马五日讯：意大利全国和平理事会发表了告意大利人民书，号召意大利人民反对武装西德，反对原子战争的威胁。
    告人民书说：“国际生活中最近发生的事件证明欧洲和世界的战争危险加深，并且向和平战士和所有不愿看见我国被拖入招致灭亡的世界战争中去的公民们提出了一项新的迫切的任务。”
    告人民书指出，这项任务是：粉碎武装西德和要用原子武器残杀人们的那些毁灭性的计划。
    告人民书还指出：武装西德和原子战争不是不可避免的。法国共和国参议院和意大利上议院的表决还可能推翻武装德国“国防军”的计划。人民群众奋斗的结果表明，目前有着有效地阻止武装西德的道路。现在，在上议院开始辩论伦敦和巴黎协定以前，每个公民都有权利和有义务要求每个下院议员和上院议员报告投票的情况，问他投了或将要投谁的票；问他是赞成还是反对武装西德，是赞成战争还是赞成和平。在一月十六日到二十三日将在意大利全国各地举行的群众集会上，几千个访问过议员的代表将要公开报告议员们投票的理由。
    告人民书接着指出：现在是我们每个人责任最重大的时刻。因此，科学家应当以自己的全部威信指出原子战争蕴藏着的危险。文化工作者应当指出新的野蛮时代到来的威胁。政治活动家应当说：“不要目的在于武装西德和分裂欧洲的巴黎协定。”
    告人民书号召：意大利人民和世界各国人民共同起来，堵住德国军国主义复活的道路！
