　　The Uses of Pneumatic Tools
　　Shi Geng

　　Among the modern tools we use in our production activities, some are powered by electricity, some by steam, some by air (compressed air), and some by water. All tools that use air as the power source are called "pneumatic tools."

　　In China, the commonly seen pneumatic tools now include: air picks—for breaking coal seams, stones, ores, minerals, and frozen soil; rock drills—for opening mine tunnels, canals, and railway tunnels; core drills—for drilling in mines; air drills—for drilling holes in non-quenched steel or metal structures; tampers—for foundry workers in machine manufacturing plants to compact sand molds and for construction workers to compact concrete; air grinders—used in all machine factories to grind burrs off castings and to grind various machine assembly surfaces; pneumatic shovels and riveting machines—for riveting steel plates when manufacturing steel roof trusses for factory buildings, locomotives and rolling stock, ships, bridges, and industrial boilers.

　　Generally speaking, pneumatic tools are not too heavy, with larger ones weighing only dozens of kilograms and smaller ones only a few kilograms. However, they are of great significance in reducing workers' physical labor and improving labor productivity. We know that a coal miner using a pickaxe can only dig a few thousand catties of coal in a hard day's work, even when encountering good coal seams; but a pneumatic pick operator—using an air pick to mine coal—can mine over a hundred tons of coal a day. In the past, when workers drilled rock, they would hold a seven- or eight-jin heavy hammer in one hand and a steel chisel in the other, using all their strength to drill, and could only drill three or four meters a day. However, the heavy-duty rock drill manufactured by the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory, operated by only two or three people, can excavate as much rock in a day as forty workers doing it manually. For example, it takes at least four or five minutes for two people to manually rivet a rivet, but with a riveting machine, one person can do it in just three to five seconds.

　　Compared to other tools, pneumatic tools have their special advantages. For example, many coal mines and mine tunnels in China have flammable gases. These gases explode when they come into contact with fire and electric sparks, which is very detrimental to workers' safety. These gases do not explode when they come into contact with wind—the power source of pneumatic tools. Therefore, many mines do not use tools powered by electricity, but use pneumatic tools. Also, if we want to dig tunnels or canals in places far from cities, there may be no flammable gases, but there is no electricity. In this case, using a rock drill only requires a diesel engine to drive an air compressor—to supply air for the rock drill. Some pneumatic tools, such as tampers and rock drills, due to their own structure, can rotate and impact up and down at the same time, which is very suitable for tamping and rock drilling. Tools powered by electricity can only rotate and cannot impact up and down. If they are also made into tools that can generate up-and-down impact force, then other equipment must be added. This is very uneconomical and inconvenient compared to pneumatic tools.

　　From this, we know that pneumatic tools are indispensable in China's industrial construction. The Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory has just been renovated and completed, and many factories and mines under the Ministry of Fuel Industry, the Ministry of Heavy Industry, and the Ministry of Machine Industry, as well as the industrial bureaus of various provinces, have come to place orders, requesting the supply of various pneumatic tools.

　　On the right are pictures of several new products manufactured by the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory. Among them: 1. A Soviet-style rock drill. It is lightweight and can be used to drive mine tunnels, break ice, and drill blasting holes. During work, rock and ore dust do not fly around, which will not affect workers' health. 2. A Soviet-style riveting machine. It weighs only a little over nine kilograms, and a worker can use it to cut and rivet steel plates. It can impact seven hundred times per minute, and its efficiency is about seventy times faster than manual labor. 3. A Soviet-style rock drill that can rotate up and down, left and right, and move back and forth during work to adjust the position of the drill hole. It is suitable for water-flushing blasting hole work in medium-hard or harder mineral layers. Mineral dust does not fly around during work. This tool is very beneficial for implementing rapid tunneling. 4. A Soviet-style air drill, weighing less than two kilograms, can be used to drill holes in non-quenched steel or metal structures, or to drill holes in places where it is not suitable to use electricity. 5. A Soviet-style air pick, most suitable for mining coal, and also suitable for excavating various rocks, ores, and frozen soil. Some coal miners in China use air picks to mine coal, and each mines more than one hundred tons of coal in eight hours. (Attached pictures)

    风动工具的用处
    石更
    在我们进行生产活动时，所使用的现代化工具中，有用电来做原动力的，有用蒸气来做原动力的，有用风（压缩空气）来做原动力的，也有用水来做原动力的。凡是用风来做原动力的，都叫做“风动工具”。
    在我国，现在常见的风动工具有以下几种：风镐—凿碎煤层、石头、矿石、矿物和冻土用；凿岩机—开辟矿山巷道、开辟运河和铁路的隧道用；钻矿机—矿山钻孔用；风钻—在未淬火的钢材或金属结构上钻眼用；捣固机—机器制造厂翻砂工人捣固砂型和基本建设工人捣固混凝土用；风砂轮—所有的机器厂用来磨铸件的毛刺和磨各种机器装配时的表面；风铲和铆钉机—制造厂房钢屋架、制造火车机车车辆、制造船舶、制造桥梁、制造工业锅炉时铆接钢板用。
    一般来说，风动工具并不太重，大的不过几十公斤，小的只有几公斤。但它对减轻工人的体力劳动，提高劳动生产率却有很重要的意义。我们知道，一个采煤工人，用丁字镐采煤，要是碰到好的煤层，辛辛苦苦掘一天，不过掘几千斤煤；但一个风镐手——用风镐采煤的——一天可以采上百吨的煤。以前工人凿岩石，是一只手举着七、八斤重的铁锤，一只手握着钢钎，用尽所有的力量打钻，一天也只能钻三、四公尺。而沈阳风动工具厂制造的重型凿岩机，只要两三个人操纵，一天开凿的岩石就要抵上四十个工人的手工操作。又如用人工铆一个铆钉，两个人至少要四、五分钟，但用铆钉机来铆，一个人只要三秒到五秒钟就可以了。
    比起其它工具来，风动工具有它的特殊方便的地方。例如，我国许多煤矿和矿山的巷道里，都有可燃的气体。这种气体碰到火和电花，就会爆炸，这对工人的安全非常不利。这种气体碰到风——风动工具的原动力——是不会爆炸的。所以很多矿山都不用以电作为原动力的工具，而使用风动工具。又如我们要在远离城市的地方凿隧道，凿运河，那里虽然没有可燃的气体，但没有电力。在这种情况下，用凿岩机，只要用一个柴油发动机带动空气压缩机——供应凿岩机用风——就成。有一类风动工具，如捣固机、凿岩机等，因为它本身的构造关系，在转动的时候，可以一面旋转，一面上下冲击，非常适合于捣固和凿岩。用电力作为原动力的工具，只能旋转，不能上下冲击。如果把它们也变成能发出上下冲击的力量的工具，那就要增加别的设备。这样比起风动工具来，是很不经济和很不方便的。
    从这里，我们便知道风动工具是在我国工业化的建设中所不可缺少的。沈阳风动工具厂刚刚改建完成，燃料工业部、重工业部、机械工业部的很多工厂和矿山，以及各省工业厅都纷纷前往订货，要求供应各种风动工具。
    右边是沈阳风动工具厂制造的几种新产品的图片。其中：1、一种苏联型式的凿岩机。它轻便，可以用来掘进矿山的巷道、打冰块和钻炮眼。工作时，岩石、矿石的粉末不飞扬，不会影响工人的健康。2、一种苏联型式的铆钉机。它只有九公斤多重，一个工人可以拿着它凿切和铆接钢板。它每分钟能冲击七百次，效率比人工快七十倍左右。3、一种苏联型式的凿岩机，在工作的时候，可以上下左右转动及前后移动，以调节钻孔的位置。它适于在中等硬度或较坚硬的矿层中，进行水冲炮眼工作。工作时矿石粉末也不飞扬。这种工具对于实行快速掘进非常有利。4、一种苏联型式的风钻，不到两公斤重，可以用来在未淬火的钢材或金属结构上钻孔，或用来在不宜使用电力的地方钻孔。5、一种苏联式的风镐，最适于用来采煤，也适于用来开凿各种岩石、矿石和冻土。我国有些采煤工人用风镐来采煤，每八小时采煤百吨以上。（附图片）
