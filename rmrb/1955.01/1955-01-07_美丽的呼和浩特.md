    Beautiful Hohhot
    The capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Hohhot, has become even more beautiful. On both sides of the five-li-long road from the new city to the old city, where there used to be barren grasslands and muddy pits, now stand new and tall buildings. The Native Produce Company Building, the Food Company Building, the Inner Mongolia Trade Union Building, the Cooperative Building, the State-run Joint Store Building, the Design Company Building, the Post and Telecommunications Building, and the People's Construction Bank of China Building have all been built here. Many beautiful bungalows newly built by the Grain and Oil Company, public canteens, and the Inner Mongolia Engineering Bureau cadre training class have gradually connected with those tall buildings. Motorcycles, small cars, Hungarian buses, and bicycles come and go on this wide and flat cement road. This new urban area is becoming increasingly prosperous.
    The city's power plant, woolen mill, post and telecommunications bureau, and other institutions have built many employee dormitories. The Hohhot Power Plant alone has built dormitory space of more than 2,730 square meters. Many employees' families have moved into new homes.
    With the development of the autonomous region's construction undertakings, the Inner Mongolia College of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine, the Inner Mongolia Normal College, the Inner Mongolia Workers and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary School, the Inner Mongolia Forestry Cadre School, the Commercial Cadre School, the Banking Cadre School, the Cooperative Cadre School, the Health Technology School, and several ordinary middle schools and normal schools in Hohhot have all been expanded, with a construction area of more than 42,000 square meters for basic cultural, educational, and health facilities. Now students of all ethnic groups in colleges and universities have moved into new dormitories and are studying in new classrooms.
    The People's Park has also built an open-air dance floor that can accommodate more than 800 people. The lake expansion project of the artificial lake in the north of the park has been expanded from the original 30,000 square meters to 60,000 square meters, and a three-hole arched bridge has been built in the center of the lake. Many young men and women come here to play and skate. If you stand on the open-air dance floor on top of the tallest building in the city center, the State-run Joint Store Building, you can not only enjoy the ice sports of young people in the People's Park, but also overlook the snow scene of Daqing Mountain and the entire city of Hohhot.
    New limestone roads have also been built in the city to facilitate urban transportation. In addition, the People's Cinema, Ulanqab Theater, Kelobu and other cultural and entertainment venues have been expanded and renovated, further enriching the cultural and entertainment life of the people of all ethnic groups.

    美丽的呼和浩特
    内蒙古自治区首府——呼和浩特市变得更加美丽了。在新城到旧城这条五华里长的马路两旁，从前有许多荒芜草滩和污泥坑，现在已被一座座新的高大建筑物所代替。这里已建起了土产公司大楼、食品公司大楼、内蒙古工会大楼、合作大楼、国营联营商店大楼、设计公司大楼、邮电大楼、中国人民建设银行大楼。粮油公司、公共食堂、内蒙古工程局干部训练班等单位新建的许多美丽平房，已和那些高大建筑物渐渐连结起来。摩托车、小卧车、匈牙利公共汽车、自行车在这条宽阔平坦的水泥马路上来来往往。这个新的市区正日益走向繁荣。
    市内发电厂、毛织厂、邮电局和其他机关建筑了不少职工宿舍。呼和浩特发电厂建筑宿舍面积即有二千七百三十多平方公尺。许多职工家属已迁入新居。
    随着自治区建设事业的发展，内蒙古畜牧兽医学院、内蒙古师范学院、内蒙古工农速成中学、内蒙古林业干部学校、商业干部学校、银行干部学校、合作干部学校、卫生技术学校、呼和浩特的几所普通中学和师范学校都进行了扩建，文教卫生基本建设的建筑面积达四万二千多平方公尺。现在各族大中学生都迁入新宿舍，并在新教室里学习着。
    人民公园也新建了能容纳八百多人的露天舞场。公园北面人造湖的扩湖工程，由原来三万平方公尺扩大到六万平方公尺，湖的中心还建筑了一座三孔拱形的小桥。不少男女青年来到这里游玩和滑冰。如果站在市中心最高的建筑物——国营联营商店大楼顶的露天舞场上，不仅可以欣赏青年们在人民公园的冰上运动，还可以凭眺大青山的雪景，了望呼和浩特的整个市容。
    市内还新修了灰石马路，便利了市内交通。此外，并扩建和改建了人民电影院、乌兰恰特、克洛布等文化娱乐场所，进一步丰富了各族人民的文化娱乐生活。　（王温）
