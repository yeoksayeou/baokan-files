    On the Job
    By Our Correspondent Jin Feng
      "Comrade, everyone has their own post for serving the motherland. My post is right here, in this space of less than a square foot." Private Pan Tianfeng squinted, measuring the ground beneath his feet.
    Beneath him was a piece of shattered rock. Two days prior, I arrived from the sea, seeing from afar this straight-rising island, as if surging from the center of the ocean. Three sides were sheer cliffs, with only some shallow beaches and rocky walls facing the mainland. I knew this was the famous Jigu Mountain, more than thirty miles from the mainland and only thirty-odd miles from the enemy-occupied Upper and Lower Dachen Islands, the first outpost on the Zhejiang coastal defense front. Now, I have come to the very forefront of this outpost, a position on the No. 1 position of Jigu Mountain.
      "But don't underestimate this place," Pan Tianfeng quickly said to me:
  "Standing here, you can see Dachen Island at a glance. See, those two lonely black dots opposite? That's the enemy's largest stronghold on the Zhejiang coast. There are also some black shadows moving back and forth, those are a few broken enemy warships near Dachen Island. Here are binoculars, take a look. Do you see that winding road on Dachen Island? The radar antenna on the hilltop, do you see it? And the houses, high and low, those aren't just houses, they're densely packed fortifications. Look again, isn't that a fishing boat coming from the south? It’s coming from Taiwan. I can see the enemy's activities clearly from here. Look north, near our mainland coastal waters, that fleet of sailboats, there must be a hundred or so, right? Our fishermen are fishing boldly in the sea now. All thanks to the liberation of Jigu Mountain. If it were a year ago..."
      Pan Tianfeng squinted again, turning toward the mainland. He is a veteran soldier of the first squad and also the deputy secretary of the island's troop Youth League branch and director of the troop club. No wonder he understood the situation on Jigu Mountain so specifically and spoke so logically.
    "More than a year ago," he pointed to the dark mass to the north near the mainland: "I was still standing on that high mountain over there, see it? That's called Longwangtang. In March or April of the year before last, I stood on Longwangtang, looking at this Jigu Mountain, which hadn't been liberated yet. That was really infuriating. At that time, a reinforced company of Chiang Kai-shek's so-called officer combat regiment was entrenched here. These dog-robbers often went out to rob merchant ships and fishing boats, harming the people. The people suffered terribly. In Longwangtang Third Village, where I lived, one person was beaten to death and seven were injured by Chiang's bandit troops. I personally bandaged their wounds. The people here didn't dare to go out to sea to fish, they all said: 'If Jigu Mountain isn't liberated, there will be no way to survive.' The people here all depend on fishing to live. If they couldn’t go to sea, they had to eat sweet potato chips every day, and the children's bellies were bulging, but they were still skinny and emaciated, which was heartbreaking to watch. The dog-robbers also sent out spies from here, sneaking onto the mainland under cover of darkness and heavy fog. At that time, Jigu Mountain really became a nail that Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang had planted on our coastal defense front. We said we must pull out this nail of Chiang Kai-shek's.
        "On June 24th of the year before last, the battle to liberate Jigu Mountain began. We were the second echelon. Before we even set sail, the brother troops of the first echelon had already stormed the mountain. Chiang Kai-shek's so-called reinforced company of the officer combat regiment was completely annihilated by us. But right here on this hillside, not far from here, a company political instructor sacrificed himself there. He was the one who led the charge up the mountain."
    He fell silent. A look of painful solemnity appeared on his cheerful face. He probably remembered many things. A flock of seagulls rose from the sea, their white wings shimmering with strange colors in the sunlight. Pan Tianfeng's vigilant eyes as a coastal defense soldier immediately searched the distance. Turning around, he smiled happily again.
      "From that time on, my post moved from Longwangtang to here. At that time, this island was so broken and desolate." He swept his gaze over the island, as if it were a witness to his words: "The mountains were full of enemy excrement and garbage, the weeds grew taller than people, and there were piles of big bluebottle flies, a black swarm when they landed. But we said that the island was so desolate because the enemy had ruined it, and it was also part of the motherland's territory, and we must guard the motherland's gate here.
      "That was in June," he sighed softly: "The southern sun was scorching like fire. The enemy's broken warships on Dachen Island shelled us day and night. We braved the artillery fire to rush to repair the fortifications. The sun burned our skin red, and blisters the size of beans rose on our shoulders, hands, and feet. The hard rocks made our shoulders bleed, and sweat dripped from our heads to our feet. None of us complained, and we even challenged and competed with each other, everyone vying to put the big rocks on their own shoulders. We fought hard against the hard rocks, opening roads from the cracks in the rocks and building fortifications. We worked all day and slept at night in the newly dug, wet fortifications. It often rained in the south, and heavy rain often woke us from our dreams. At this time, our first task was to pick up our raincoats and tarpaulins and rush to cover the guns and ammunition. Weapons are our second life. We often got soaked in the rain until dawn. In those days, we often talked about Beijing, about Chairman Mao. We saw from picture books and movies that Chairman Mao was very healthy, and we said: 'As long as Chairman Mao is healthy, that is our blessing. As long as our capital becomes more beautiful year by year, we will have no objection to living in air-raid shelters for a few more years.'
    "Actually, our powerful motherland and Chairman Mao are always concerned about us, so why would they want us to live in air-raid shelters for a few years? Tents were transported from the mainland, tin houses were transported, and finally, green bricks and wood were transported. We moved from caves to tents, to tin houses, and now we all live in newly built barracks. Everyone says that this year, we have progressed from primitive society to socialist society."
    Following his finger, the new barracks seemed to be embedded in the rocks, with walls made of yellow granite and roofs made of green bricks, and large glass windows shining in the sun. Pan Tianfeng's face also seemed to be glowing. He smiled and continued: "You've probably been inside, haven't you? Inside, the beams and pillars are all varnished with tung oil, new wooden beds, new washstands, new clothes racks, and even the guns have brand new gun racks, it's very tidy. This is all our powerful motherland's concern for us and the support of the people of the whole country." There was a proud tone in his voice, a tone of a soldier feeling proud for his country. His voice gradually became impassioned, he took a step forward, his eyes looking ahead:
    "Now, I stand on this post, constantly monitoring the enemy, and will never let the enemy get one step closer to our mainland."
    His tone gradually calmed down again, as if he were talking about something self-evident: "The enemy is unwilling to accept defeat. Just take the enemy on Dachen Island, they shell us here, towards the mainland, every day. A few warships sway back and forth, constantly trying to attack us. And those few broken planes, they always fly over our heads, whirring back and forth, trying to land spies or spread reactionary leaflets. Last March, they even threw three bombs at us here. They are determined to come and destroy our happy life.
      "That is naturally a dream. Our strength is stronger than the enemy. Last April, one day I was on this post and saw our merchant ships traveling south and north on the ocean, busy transporting the things needed for construction. I was especially happy to see that. But Liu Lianyi (commander of Chiang's bandit troops on Dachen Island), who was unwilling to accept defeat, sent two broken warships from Dachen Island straight towards our merchant ships. I was very worried when our naval gunboats arrived, and together with the coastal artillery, they opened fire on the enemy ships, preventing those guys from advancing, and they had to turn around and slip away. It was really exhilarating to watch. Even more gratifying was that our Silver Swallows often came to the skies over Dachen. It's ridiculous how those broken enemy planes, as soon as they saw our Silver Swallows, hid so that they couldn't even be seen. They were afraid that our Silver Swallows would catch them like an eagle catching a chick and throw them into the sea to feed the fish. We were so happy to watch. One person said: 'Go bomb Dachen!' Another said: 'Hit them hard!' It was as if they could hear us talking in the air. One day our Silver Swallows came again, and the dog-robbers used high-射 guns, machine guns, and other weapons from Dachen Island and Iron Turtles—those broken warships—to fire wildly at the sky. But our Silver Swallows flew so fast that they couldn't even see its shadow, and the dog-robbers wasted all the ammunition that their American fathers had sent them." As he spoke, he laughed heartily, and I laughed with him. The sun was setting in the west, casting a large shadow of Jigu Mountain on the sea, and the fishing boats were all returning to port. There seemed to be a trace of melancholy in Pan Tianfeng's eyes. I smiled and asked the veteran soldier: "Missing home?"
    Pan Tianfeng was silent for a while, then honestly admitted: "I've been away from home for six or seven years and haven't been back once. It would be a lie to say I don't miss it." He gently kicked the rock under his feet, "But as soon as I step on this post, I say to myself: 'Pan Tianfeng, Pan Tianfeng, this is the post the motherland has given you to guard the gate, you must keep your eyes wide open, watch the enemy, and not let the enemy defile one inch of our great motherland's territory again.' At this time, I only stare at Dachen in my eyes, I only hear the enemy's movements in my ears, and I only consider how to eliminate the enemy in my heart. When it is dark and windy, the waves on the sea roll up as high as small mountains, the wind howls like tens of thousands of horses neighing, and the heavy rain beats on the face, making it painful, and you can't even stand still. At this time, I am even more careful, standing close to the rocks, holding the gun tightly in my hand. If the rain makes it impossible to open my eyes, I listen quietly for the sound of motors on the sea with my ears. At this time, I can't help but think: In all parts of our motherland, at this time, steelworkers are standing next to the Martin furnace with a temperature of more than 1,000 degrees, survey teams are walking on uninhabited wild mountains, farmers are bending over to harvest, students are sitting in classrooms, our naval brothers are patrolling the ocean... Everyone in our motherland is working hard for socialism, and I am also standing guard for socialism in the wind and rain. As long as each of us does our job well, socialist society will come quickly."
    "Standing guard for socialism," how clearly Pan Tianfeng summarized the soldiers' thoughts. I jokingly asked him: "How long are you going to stand on this post?"
    He replied calmly: "I will stand for as long as the motherland orders me to stand."

    在岗位上
    本报记者  金凤
      “同志，每个人都有自己为祖国服务的岗位，我的岗位就在这里，在这不到一尺见方的地方”。一班战士潘田丰眯细了双眼，打量着他脚下的土地说。
    他的脚下是一块敲碎了的岩石。两天以前，我从海上来，远远望见这一座笔直的海岛，就像从大海中央涌出来的一样。三面全是悬崖绝壁，只有面向大陆的一面有些浅滩石壁。我知道，这就是有名的积谷山，它离大陆三十多里，离敌人盘踞的上、下大陈也只有三十多里，是浙江海防前线的第一个前哨据点。现在，我就来到这前哨据点的最前哨，积谷山第一号阵地的一个岗位上。
      “可你别小看这地方”，潘田丰马上对我说：
  “站在这里，一眼就望到大陈，你看，就是对面那两个孤零零的黑点。这是浙江沿海敌人最大的据点。周围还有些黑影来回晃动，那是大陈附近敌人的几只破兵舰。这有望远镜，你带上看，看到大陈山上那弯弯曲曲的公路了吧？山顶上还有雷达天线，看到了吗？还有高高低低一片房屋，那些不简单是房屋，是密密麻麻的工事，你再看，从南向北不是来了一艘渔轮？这是从台湾开来的。敌人的活动我这里都看得清清楚楚。你再看北面，靠近咱们大陆近海那一片帆船，少说也有百十来只吧，我们的渔民都放心大胆在海里捕鱼了。全亏咱积谷山解放了哩，要是一年以前……”
      潘田丰的双眼又眯细起来，转身向着大陆的那边。他是一班的老战士，又是岛上部队青年团支部副书记，部队俱乐部主任。难怪他对积谷山的情况了解得那么具体，说起来又这么有条有理。
    “一年多以前”，他用手指着北面靠近大陆那黑糊糊的一片：“我还站在那边高山上，看见了吧，那叫龙王堂。前年三、四月间我就站在龙王堂上望着这座还没有解放的积谷山。那才叫人生气哩。那时候，蒋介石的什么军官战斗团的一个加强连盘踞在这里。这班狗强盗就常常出去抢劫商船、渔船，祸害老百姓。老百姓可受罪了。我住的龙王堂三村，老百姓就被蒋贼军打死一个，打伤七个，我亲手替他们包扎了伤口。这一带老百姓都不敢下海捕鱼了，都说：“积谷山再不解放，就没有活路了。”这里老百姓全指着打鱼过活呀。不能下海，他们就只得天天吃地瓜干，吃得小孩子的肚皮一个个鼓起老高，可就是精瘦精瘦，皮包骨头，看着真叫人难过。狗强盗们还从这里放出特务，乘着黑天大雾，偷偷摸上大陆。那时候，这积谷山真成了蒋介石匪帮安在我们海防前线的一根钉子。我们说一定要拔掉蒋介石这颗钉子。
        “前年六月二十四日，解放积谷山的战斗开始了。我们是第二梯队，还没有等到我们开船哩，一梯队的兄弟部队已经冲上山了。国民党的军官战斗团的什么加强连全部被我们歼灭。但是就在这山腰，离这里不远，一个连的指导员牺牲在那里，他是带头冲上山的。”
    他沉默下来。他的开朗的脸上显出痛苦的严肃的神色。他大概想起许多事情。一群海鸥从海上飞起，它们白色的翅膀在阳光下闪耀着奇异的颜色。潘田丰的海防战士的警觉的眼睛立刻向远方搜索着。转过身来，他又愉快地笑了。
      “从那时候起，我的岗位就从龙王堂移到这里。那时候，这海岛是多么破烂荒凉啊。”他向海岛扫了一眼，仿佛它是他说话的见证人似的：“满山是敌人遗留下来的粪便、垃圾，荒草长得比人还高，还有一堆堆的大头苍蝇，停下来就是黑鸦鸦的一片。可是我们说，这海岛所以这样荒凉，是敌人糟蹋的，它也是祖国土地的一部分，我们一定要在这里守住祖国的大门。
      “那时正是六月天气”，他轻轻叹了口气：“这南方的太阳晒得像火烤一般。大陈那边敌人几只破兵舰，又不分白天黑夜向我们开炮。我们冒着炮火赶修工事。太阳烤红了我们的皮肤，我们的肩膀上、手上、脚上，都打起一个个豆大的水泡，硬石头压得我们肩膀出血，汗水从头上滴到脚下。我们没有一个叫苦，还挑战、竞赛，大家抢着把大石头压上自己肩膀。我们硬是同硬石头作斗争，从石头缝里开出路来，修起工事来。我们白天干了一天，晚上就睡在刚挖起的湿漉漉的工事里。南方多雨，常常一阵大雨把我们从梦中浇醒。这时候，我们第一件事就是拿起雨衣雨布奔去遮盖枪炮弹药。武器是我们的第二生命啊。我们就常常在雨中淋到天明。那些时候我们常常谈到北京，谈到毛主席。我们从画报上、电影上看到毛主席很健康，我们说：“只要毛主席身体健康，就是我们的福气。只要我们的首都一年比一年美丽，我们就是再住上几年防空洞，也没有意见。
    “其实我们强大的祖国和毛主席时时在关心着我们，哪里会要我们住上几年防空洞？从大陆运来了帐篷，运来了铁皮房子，最后又运来青砖和木料。我们从地洞搬到帐篷，搬到铁皮房子，现在又都住上新盖的营房，大家都说我们这一年是从原始社会进到社会主义社会了。”
    沿着他的手指看去，一座座新营房像是镶嵌在岩石中似的，黄色花岗石砌的墙，青砖盖的顶，大玻璃窗在太阳中闪闪发光。潘田丰的脸上也像发光似的。他微笑着继续说：“你大概进去看过吧，里面一式是黄澄澄桐油油过的梁和柱，新木床、新洗脸架、新衣架，连枪也有了崭新的枪架，可整齐啦。这都是我们强大祖国对我们的关怀和全国人民对我们的支援。”他的声音中有一种自豪的调子，有一种战士为了自己祖国感到骄傲的调子。他的声音渐渐激昂起来，他向前跨了一步，眼睛望着前面：
    “现在，我站在这岗位上，时时监视着敌人，决不让敌人靠近我们大陆一步。”
    他的声调又逐渐平静下来，像在说着一件理所当然的事：“敌人是死不甘心的，就说大陈的敌人吧，天天向这里，向大陆打炮。几只兵舰晃来晃去，不断想打我们的主意。还有那几架破飞机，也老在我们头上呜呜地飞过来，飞过去，不是想降落特务，就是想散布反动传单。去年三月还朝我们这里扔了三颗炸弹。他们打定主意要来破坏我们的幸福生活。
      “这自然是梦想。我们的力量比敌人更强。去年四月间，有一天我就在这岗位上，看到我们的商船在海洋上南来北往，忙着运输建设上需要的东西，我看着心里特别高兴。可是那死不甘心的刘濂一（大陈蒋贼军指挥官）从大陈那里派出两条破兵舰，直向我们商船开来。我心里正万分着急，我们海军的炮艇开来了，加上海岸炮兵，一齐向敌舰开火，打得那些家伙无法前进，只得掉过头来溜了。我看着真有说不出的痛快。更高兴的是我们的银燕这一阵也常常来到大陈上空。可笑敌人那些破飞机，一见我们的银燕来了，就躲得连影踪也不见了。它怕我们银燕像老鹰抓小鸡似地把它摔到大海去喂鱼。我们看着可高兴极了。这个说：
  “到大陈去炸啊！”那个说：“狠狠地打！”真仿佛他在空中会听到我们说话似的。有一天我们的银燕又来了，狗强盗们就用大陈山上和铁乌龟——那破兵舰上的高射炮、机关炮等火器向空中猛打。可是我们的银燕飞得连影踪也叫它看不见，狗强盗们白白浪费了他美国爸爸送的那么些弹药。”说着他哈哈大笑起来，我也随着他笑起来。太阳向西斜射着，将积谷山的一大片阴影投射在海上，渔船都在归航了。潘田丰的眼睛里似乎有一丝忧郁的神色。我笑着问这个老战士：“想家了吧？”
    潘田丰沉默了一会，随即老实地承认：“离家六、七年，没有回去过一次，说不想是瞎话。”他用脚轻轻踢着他脚下的岩石，“只是，我一踏到这岗位上，我就对自己说：‘潘田丰、潘田丰，这是祖国交给你把守大门的岗位，你，可要睁大眼睛，看住敌人，不能让敌人再玷污我们伟大祖国一寸土地。’这时候，我眼里盯住的只有大陈，耳中听到的只有敌人的动静，心中捉摸的也只有怎样消灭敌人。遇到天黑风大，海上波涛卷起像小山般高，风声呜呜像几万匹马叫，大雨夹打得脸上生疼，连站也站不住。我这时就更加小心，紧靠岩石站着，握紧手中的枪。雨打得睁不开眼，就用耳朵静听海上有无马达声响。这时候，我也禁不住想到：在我们祖国各处，这时候，炼钢工人站在一千多度的马丁炉旁，勘察队走在没有人走过的荒山上，农民弯着腰在收割，学生坐在课堂，我们的海军兄弟巡逻在海洋……我们祖国每个人都在为社会主义努力工作，我也在风雨中给社会主义站岗。只要我们每个人做好自己岗位的工作，社会主义社会就来得快了。”
    “给社会主义站岗”，潘田丰多么明快地总结了战士们的思想。我开玩笑地问他：“你这岗位准备站多久？”
    他不慌不忙地回答：“祖国命令我站多久，我就站多久。”
