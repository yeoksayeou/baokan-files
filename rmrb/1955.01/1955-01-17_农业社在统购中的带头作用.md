    The Leading Role of Agricultural Cooperatives in Unified Purchase

    Twenty-eight agricultural production cooperatives in Hengshan County, Hunan Province, played a very good exemplary role in the unified grain purchase work of 1954-1955. Before the official determination of grain purchase tasks in various townships, they took the lead in selling more than 455,000 jin of surplus grain. When Wanfu Township in the First District held a representatives' meeting, the Hongxing Agricultural Production Cooperative sent eight activists to participate. At the meeting, they explained the benefits of the policy of unified purchase and sales of grain based on their personal experiences, and truthfully reported the actual output, proposing appropriate ration standards. Under their influence, seven mutual aid team leaders, including Hu Dongsheng, also reported the actual output and guaranteed to withstand the test of unified purchase and sales, striving to transform into agricultural production cooperatives. The grain purchase work in this township was thus carried out quite smoothly. The Kang Juying Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Fifth District quickly overfulfilled the task of selling 26,000 jin of surplus grain, and also helped farmers such as Li Yanming and Tan Bingsheng, who lacked labor, to send the sold surplus grain to the national granary.

    农业社在统购中的带头作用
    湖南省衡山县的二十八个农业生产合作社，在一九五四—一九五五年度的粮食统购工作中很好地发挥了模范作用。各乡统购任务正式确定以前，它们就带头卖出四十五万五千多斤余粮。第一区万福乡的红星农业生产合作社在全乡开代表会的时候，派了八个积极分子参加。会上，他们结合亲身体验说明了粮食统购统销政策的好处，同时如实地报出实际产量，提出了适当的口粮标准。在他们的影响下，胡冬生等七个互助组组长也报出了实际产量，并且保证要经得起统购统销的考验，争取转为农业生产合作社。这个乡的粮食统购工作因此开展得相当顺利。第五区康菊英农业生产合作社很快就超额完成了出售二万六千斤余粮的任务，还帮助缺乏劳动力的李炎明、谭兵生等农户把出售的余粮送入国家粮库。（李可农）
