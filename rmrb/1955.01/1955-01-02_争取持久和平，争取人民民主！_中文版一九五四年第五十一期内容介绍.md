    "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" the Chinese edition of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties' organ, 1954, Issue 51, has been published.

    This issue dedicates considerable space to editorials and articles commemorating the 75th anniversary of Stalin's birth. The title of this issue's editorial is: "J.V. Stalin - The Great Successor to Lenin's Cause." The editorial states: Stalin's life and activities are inseparable from the heroic history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people's struggle for communism, and the development of the world's liberation movement. Stalin's lifelong career is an inspiring example of selfless service to the people. Stalin summarized the rich experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union and the experience of the modern world's liberation movement, creatively further developed the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism in accordance with new historical conditions, and enriched revolutionary theory with new principles on several issues. Since Stalin's death, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has continued to lead the Communist Party and the Soviet people firmly and confidently along the Leninist path towards new victories. The historical experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the works of Lenin and Stalin, are of great significance to the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries. The great cause of Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin, the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism, is invincible.

    This issue contains commemorative articles including "Lenin's and Stalin's Thoughts Inspire the People of All Countries to Struggle for Peace, Democracy, and Socialism" by B. Bierut, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party; "Stalin - A Loyal Student and Successor to Lenin's Cause" by A. Novotny, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia; and "Lenin-Stalin's Policy of Peace and International Security" by G. Gheorghiu-Dej, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Romanian People's Republic and Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party.

    This issue also publishes an article by H. Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, entitled "The British People Oppose the London and Paris Agreements." Pollitt's article states: For several months, the struggle against the rearmament of Germany has been the central issue of British political life. The vast majority of working people have expressed their opposition to the policy of arming West Germany. However, the Conservative government has been frantically pursuing the policy of reviving German militarism even after the French people defeated the "European Defense Community" plan. As a result of these activities by American and British imperialists, the London and Paris Agreements aimed at rearming West Germany were finally signed. The government has secured the approval of these agreements and is now striving to put pressure on France and West Germany to approve them. The article emphasizes that this situation places a very important task before the peace forces in Britain, which is that they must work harder to fight against these agreements. The Communist Party of Great Britain is issuing an urgent appeal to all the British people, calling on them to take immediate action to strive for peace. The peace-loving people of the world are capable of defeating this evil plan to rearm former Nazis. We believe that the British people will fully exert their strength in this great struggle for lasting peace. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五四年第五十一期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五四年第五十一期中文版已经出版。
    这一期以大量篇幅发表社论和文章，纪念斯大林诞生七十五周年。这一期社论的题目是：“约·维·斯大林——列宁事业的伟大继承者”。社论说：斯大林的一生和活动是同苏联共产党的英雄的历史、苏联人民争取共产主义的斗争、世界解放运动的发展分不开的。斯大林的毕生事业是忘我地为人民服务的一个令人鼓舞的榜样。斯大林总结了苏联社会主义建设的丰富经验和现代世界解放运动的经验，按照新的历史条件创造性地进一步发展了马克思列宁主义的学说，并且在若干问题上以新的原理丰富了革命理论。自从斯大林逝世以来，苏联共产党中央委员会继续领导共产党和苏联人民坚定地和满怀信心地沿着列宁主义的道路走向新的胜利。苏联共产党的历史经验、列宁和斯大林的著作对于各国共产党和工人党具有重大的意义。伟大的马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林的事业，和平、民主和社会主义的事业，是不可战胜的。
    这一期刊载的纪念文章有波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记波·贝鲁特的“列宁和斯大林的思想鼓舞各国人民为和平、民主和社会主义而斗争”、捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会第一书记安·诺沃提尼的“斯大林——列宁事业的忠实学生和继承者”和罗马尼亚人民共和国部长会议主席、罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会政治局委员格·乔治乌—德治的“列宁—斯大林的和平和国际安全的政策”。
    这一期还刊载了英国共产党总书记哈·波立特的“英国人民反对伦敦和巴黎协定”的文章。波立特的文章说：好几个月以来，反对重新武装德国的斗争一直是英国政治生活的中心问题。绝大多数劳动人民都表示反对武装西德的政策。但是，保守党政府在法国人民击败了“欧洲防务集团”计划以后却还疯狂地执行复活德国军国主义的政策。由于美国和英国帝国主义者进行了这些活动，旨在重新武装西德的伦敦和巴黎协定终于签订了。政府已经使这些协定得到批准，并且现在正在竭力对法国和西德施加压力，使它们批准这些协定。文章着重说：这种情况使英国和平力量面临一项非常重大的任务，就是它们必须更努力地为反对这些协定而斗争。英国共产党向全体英国人民发出紧急号召，呼吁他们立即行动起来争取和平。全世界爱好和平的人民是能够击败当前这个重新武装前纳粹分子的罪恶计划的。我们相信英国人民在争取持久和平这一重大斗争中一定会充分发挥自己的力量。（新华社）
