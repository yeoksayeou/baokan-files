    Unforgettable Mentors and Helpful Friends
    Zhèn Yǔ
    The Chinese employees of all ethnicities in the Dushanzi mining area of the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company, at the foot of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang, studied and discussed the Sino-Soviet Communiqué and related documents with immense gratitude to welcome the formal handover of the company.

    The employees of all ethnicities could not help but recall five years ago. When our country was in a difficult period of restoring the national economy, the "Dushanzi Oil Mine" was facing considerable difficulties. At that time, the production equipment was very backward: in several shallow wells drilled a long time ago, the workers used oil extraction tools like water-drawing pulleys, expending great effort to barely extract a little oil. The workers used horse-drawn carts to pull the oil from the mine shafts barrel by barrel, and then poured it into distillation pots barrel by barrel. The refinery workers checked the distillation of crude oil by looking at the color of the oil and smelling its odor. The hundred or so workers in the entire mining area spent their days engaged in heavy physical labor, and the gasoline and kerosene produced were not only small in quantity but also of poor quality.

    After the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company, the Dushanzi mining area gained new life. Soon after the company was established, a large number of the latest Soviet drilling rigs were shipped to the mine, and excellent Soviet drilling experts came to the mine one after another. In front of and behind the mountains of the mining area, towering steel derricks were erected everywhere, and large-scale drilling work was launched vigorously. At the same time, the Soviet government shipped complete sets of modern refining equipment to the mine, and new refineries were also established. The workers no longer used their eyes and noses to check the distillation of crude oil, but instead used various instruments. In 1954, a fully automated cracking workshop was established in the refinery, and the equipment of the old refinery was thoroughly renovated. The backward oil extraction work was also completely changed. The oil extraction tools that resembled water-drawing pulleys became exhibits, and Soviet-supplied electric pumping units replaced them. The pumping units continuously pumped oil from thousands of meters below the ground to the surface day and night, and then automatically flowed into the refinery through oil pipes and storage tanks.

    In the process of building the Dushanzi mining area, Soviet experts and technicians demonstrated great internationalist spirit and selfless labor enthusiasm. At the beginning of drilling, the Soviet drilling technicians braved gale and heavy snow, personally working as drillers, often doing the work of several people. When building new factory buildings, the Soviet comrades in charge stayed at the construction site for days and nights without sleep, never leaving. When the new factory buildings started operating, because the Chinese workers had not yet mastered the technology, the Soviet comrades worked continuously in several shifts, personally operating the main machines. Once, geological expert Nevsky fell down the mountain and was injured during work. He only rested for one day, and before the wound healed, he started working again. The Chinese employees wanted him to rest for a few more days, but he said seriously: "We came to China to help China's industrial construction and train Chinese cadres. Now is not the time to rest." Wang Bingcheng, a Chinese drilling technician from well number 130, said: "When Soviet comrades meet, they ask each other: How many meters have you drilled for China? How many skilled workers and technicians have you trained for China? The Soviet comrades regard the work of training Chinese workers and cadres as their most important responsibility."

    The Chinese workers and technicians all spoke with infinite gratitude and utmost respect about the help the Soviet comrades gave them. Rouzi Ayufu (a Uyghur), who came to the mine in March 1951 and is now a deputy drilling technician, told me: "When I came to the mine, I didn't understand anything. When I first became a driller, the Soviet technician Kuligov taught me how to lift and lower drilling tools, explaining it and then doing it himself for me to see. When I couldn't grasp it well, I was anxious and flustered, but Comrade Kuligov was not worried. He held my hand and operated together with me. Then, he let me operate myself, and explained to me in detail. In this way, day after day, Comrade Kuligov patiently guided me, and I also studied day and night. Only now have I learned some technology. If the Soviet comrades had not taught me so patiently, I would not have learned the technology."

    Lu Mingbao, a young drilling technician from well number 125, told me: "The Soviet comrades also provided us with technical education on preventing and handling accidents. Comrade Shaplinov often told me how accidents happen and how to prevent them. Sometimes, the Soviet comrades would insist that you first propose a solution before he told you. The Soviet comrades were most dissatisfied with people who did not use their brains at work. Last August, gas was drilled in the well. Comrade Shaplinov asked me: 'If you were the drilling technician, how would you handle this accident?' When my answer was incomplete, he pointed out my mistakes. He repeatedly told me: When you encounter something, you must be calm and use your brain well. Some time ago, Comrade Shaplinov went to drill new wells, and well number 125 was handed over to me to lead independently. Before he left, he sincerely said to me: 'I am leaving, your responsibility is great. If anything happens in the well, if you have any difficult problems, come to me at any time.' Recently, I have met him several times, and he always asks about the situation of our well with great concern, and tells me a lot of work experience.

    The Soviet comrades not only taught our Chinese workers and technicians to master practical operating experience, but they also taught scientific knowledge to the Chinese workers and technicians. The mine's various departments have successively held many technical theory study classes. The Soviet comrades sacrificed their sleeping time to compile systematic lecture notes, draw various charts, and sacrificed their rest time to give classes to the workers and technicians. In the classroom, they taught the Chinese workers and technicians the structure and function of the machines bit by bit. After class, they combined it with the actual operation on site to explain scientific knowledge to the workers. The Soviet comrades often said to the Chinese workers: If we teach you practical operation techniques, but do not make you understand the scientific principles, our work is only half done.

    When I was talking with Rouzi Ayufu (a Uyghur), the deputy drilling technician of well number 130, he took out his notebook for me to see. In this thick notebook, he had densely written half of it, and also drawn many crooked machine diagrams. He told me:
    "These are all basic knowledge of drilling work and machine diagrams. These were all explained by the Soviet experts in the classroom and on the construction site. I wrote them down and drew them, and I look at them whenever I have time."

    Thanks to the enthusiastic help of the Soviet comrades, the technical level of the Chinese employees has rapidly improved. Under the guidance of experts, well number 130, led by drilling technician Wang Bingcheng, created a new national record of 230 meters per day in June last year. During the May 1st Labor Day and National Day last year, eighty Chinese employees in the entire mining area were named labor models. Among the skilled workers, ethnic minority skilled workers accounted for 68 percent.

    All employees of the Dushanzi Oil Mine deeply appreciate the great help from the Soviet Union over the past few years, and they are determined to continue to learn from the advanced Soviet experience and build the petroleum company even better. Walis (a Kazakh), chairman of the mine's trade union, said: "The Soviet people helped us build such a large petroleum company, and then transferred all the Soviet shares in the company to our country. This is truly the greatest friendship and the most sincere and generous assistance. Our Chinese workers, technicians, and management cadres in the entire mining area will work a hundred times harder to intensify our learning from the Soviet Union, strive to improve our production technology level and enterprise management level, manage well the enterprises that the Soviet people have helped us build, and enable it to achieve even greater development."

    难忘的良师和益友
    镇禹
    新疆天山脚下中苏石油公司独山子矿区的各族中方职工们，以万分感激的心情，学习和讨论了中苏会谈公报及有关各项文件，迎接公司的正式移交。
    各族职工们情不自禁地回想起了五年以前。当我们国家正处在恢复国民经济的艰难时期，“独山子油矿”曾经是多么困难。那时生产设备是很落后的：在几口很早以前钻下的浅井里，工人们用着像打水的辘轳一样的抽油工具，费尽力气，才勉强地抽出一点点石油。工人们用马车从矿井上把石油一桶一桶的拉回来，再一桶一桶的倒进蒸馏锅。炼油工人们察看原油的蒸馏情况，是用眼睛看油的颜色，用鼻子嗅油的气味。全矿区百十个工人，就这样成天进行着繁重的体力劳动，而所生产出的汽油、煤油，不但数量少，质量也很不好。
    中苏石油公司成立后，独山子矿区就获得了新的生命。公司成立不久，矿上陆续运来了大批苏联最新式的全套钻机，优秀的苏联钻井专家们纷纷来到矿上。矿区的山前山后，到处架起了耸入云霄的钢铁井架，轰轰烈烈地展开了大规模的钻井工作。同时，苏联政府又把整套的近代化的炼油设备运到矿上，新的炼油厂也建立了起来。工人们再也不是用眼、用鼻子察看原油的蒸馏情况，而是由各种仪表来代替。一九五四年炼油厂里又建立起了一所完全自动化的裂化车间，并彻底改装了旧炼油厂的设备。落后的抽油工作也彻底改变了，像打水辘轳一样的抽油工具变成了展览品，替代它进行抽油工作的是苏联运来的电动抽油机。抽油机日夜不停地把数千公尺地层下面的石油抽到地面上来，经过油管、储油罐，自动流进炼油厂。
    在建设独山子矿区的过程中，苏联专家和技术人员们表现了伟大的国际主义精神和忘我的劳动热情。在开始钻井的时候，苏联钻井技师们都是冒着狂风大雪，亲自担任钻井员的工作，经常是一个人做几个人的工作。在建立新厂房的时候，负责的苏联同志们都是几天几夜的不睡觉，寸步不离的守在工地上。新厂房开工的时候，因为中方工人还没有掌握技术，苏联同志又是接连几班的连着工作，亲自操纵着主要的机器。有一次，地质专家湼夫斯基在工作中由山上滚下来跌伤了，他只休息了一天，不等伤口复原，又重新开始工作。中方职工都要他再休息几天，他却严肃的说：“我们到中国来，是帮助中国工业建设和培养中国干部的，现在不是休息的时候。”一百三十号中方钻井技师王炳诚说：“苏联同志们碰在一起的时候，就互相问：你为中国钻进了多少公尺？你为中国培养了多少技术工人和技术人员？苏联同志把培养中国工人、干部的工作当作是自己最重要的责任。”
    中国的工人、技术人员们都以无限感激和万分尊敬的心情，来讲述苏联同志对他们的帮助。一九五一年三月才来到矿上，现在已经是副钻井技师的肉孜·阿尤甫（维吾尔族）给我说：“我来到矿上时，什么也不懂，我刚当钻井员的时候，苏联技师库里戈夫就教我怎么样提钻具、下钻具，讲了，又自己做了给我看。我掌握不好，心里又急又慌，库里戈夫同志却不着急，他握着我的手，和我一齐操作。然后，再让我自己操作，又详细的给我说，就这样，一天又一天，库里戈夫同志始终热情地教导我，我也白天黑夜的学，现在才学会了一些技术，不是苏联同志这样耐心地教我，我就不会学到技术。”
    一百二十五号井一个年青的钻井技师陆铭宝给我说：“苏联同志还对我们进行防止和处理事故的技术教育，沙甫林诺夫同志常常告诉我，事故是怎样发生的，应该怎样防止。有时候，苏联同志一定要你先提出处理意见来，然后他再告诉你。苏联同志最不满意在工作中不动脑筋的人。去年八月间，井上钻出了瓦斯。沙甫林诺夫同志问我：“假如你是钻井技师，你怎么处理这件事故？”当我回答得不完全时，他就指出我的错处。他一再告诉我：遇到事情，要镇静，要很好地运用脑子。前些时候，沙甫林诺夫同志打新井去了，一百二十五号井就交由我独自来领导，他临走时诚恳的对我说：“我要走了，你的责任很大，井上发生了什么事情，你有了什么困难问题，随时来找我。”最近，我碰见了他好几次，他总是非常关切的问我们井上的情况，又告诉了我许多工作经验。
    苏联同志不只是教会了我们中方的工人、技术人员们掌握了实际的操作经验，他们还把科学知识教给中国的工人、技术人员。矿上各个部门先后举办了许多次的技术理论学习班。苏联同志们牺牲了睡觉时间，编出了系统的讲义，画出各种图表，又牺牲了休息时间给工人、技术人员们上课。他们在课堂上把机器的构造、作用，一点一点的教给中国工人、技术人员。课后，又结合着现场的实际操作，给工人们讲解科学知识。苏联同志们常向中国工人们说：教会了你们实际操作技术，没有使你们明白科学道理，我们的工作只算作了一半。
    当我和一百三十号井副钻井技师肉孜·阿尤甫
  （维吾尔族）谈话的时候，他拿出了笔记本让我看。在这个厚厚的笔记本上，密密麻麻的记了半本子，还画着许多歪歪扭扭的机器图。他告诉我：
  “这都是钻井工作的基本常识和机器图解。这些都是苏联专家们在课堂上、在工地上讲的，我把它记下来、画下来，一有时间就看。”
    由于苏联同志的热诚帮助，中方职工的技术水平迅速地提高了。钻井技师王炳诚领导的一百三十号井在专家的指导下，在去年六月份创造了日进二百三十公尺的全国最高新纪录。在去年五一劳动节和国庆节，全矿区有八十个中方职工被评为劳动模范。在技术工人中，民族技术工人占了百分之六十八。
    独山子油矿的全体职工深切地感谢苏联几年来的伟大帮助，他们决心要继续学习苏联先进经验，把石油公司建设得更好。矿区工会主席瓦力斯（哈萨克族）说：“苏联人民帮助我们建设了这么大的
  一个石油公司，又将公司中的苏联股份全部移交给我们国家，这真是最伟大的友谊，最真诚最慷慨的援助。我们全矿区的中国工人、技术人员、管理干部，要百倍努力的加紧向苏联学习，努力提高生产技术水平、企业管理水平，把苏联人民帮助我们建设起来的企业管理好，并使它获得更大的发展。”
