Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 1st: The Prime Minister of India, Nehru, and the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Ali, who attended the Prime Ministers' Conference of the Five South Asian Countries, left Jakarta on December 31st to return home. The Prime Minister of Ceylon, Kotelawala, had already returned home on December 30th. The Prime Minister of Burma, U Nu, toured Bandung and Yogyakarta and returned home on January 1st.

    Indian Prime Minister Nehru held a press conference in Jakarta on December 30th, where he discussed his views on the Manila Treaty, saying that the treaty does not only involve the signatory countries, as is usually the case with treaties, but goes beyond that scope. He said it is very much like reviving the old concept of spheres of influence. When asked by reporters whether the holding of the Asian-African Conference would thwart the establishment of such blocs, he said, "I hope so. We hope that this conference will thwart the establishment of such blocs."

    Prime Minister Ali said at a press conference held in Jakarta on the 30th that the Bogor Conference was very successful. All issues were discussed, and consensus was reached on these issues. He hoped that the Asian-African Conference would also be successfully concluded.

    In response to a reporter's question about the Taiwan issue, Prime Minister Ali said, "As far as Pakistan is concerned, we recognize the People's Republic of China. We do not recognize Taiwan as representing China."

    According to Antara News Agency, Prime Minister U Nu also held a press conference in Yogyakarta. He said at the meeting that if Asian countries are not united, other countries will certainly not respect them, but if Asian countries are united, no other country can easily influence them. Before departing for home on January 1st, Prime Minister U Nu told the press at the airport: "The achievements of the Bogor Conference are very helpful in establishing peace. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence were put forward at the Bogor Conference, and these principles will also be put forward at the future Asian-African Conference."

    印、巴、锡、缅四国总理离雅加达回国
    【新华社雅加达一日电】出席南亚五国总理会议的印度总理尼赫鲁、巴基斯坦总理阿里在十二月三十一日离雅加达回国。锡兰总理科特拉瓦拉已在十二月三十日回国。缅甸总理吴努去万隆和日惹游览后已于一月一日回国。
    印度总理尼赫鲁十二月三十日在雅加达举行记者招待会谈到对马尼拉条约的看法时说，这个条约不是像一般条约的情况那样只涉及各签字国，而是超出了这个范围。他说，这很像是在复活势力范围的旧概念。在记者问到亚非会议的举行是否会挫折这种集团的建立时，他说，我希望这样。我们希望这个会议会挫折这种集团的建立。
    阿里总理三十日在雅加达举行的记者招待会上说，茂物会议是非常成功的。一切问题都讨论了，而且在这些问题上都取得了一致的意见。他希望，亚非会议也将会胜利结束。
    在回答有的记者提出的关于台湾的问题时，阿里总理说，就巴基斯坦而言，我们承认中华人民共和国。我们不承认台湾是代表中国的。
    据安塔拉通讯社报道，吴努总理也在日惹举行了记者招待会。他在会上说，如果亚洲国家不团结，其他国家就一定不会尊重它们，而如果亚洲国家团结一致，任何其他国家就不能轻易地影响它们。吴努总理在一日启行回国前在机场对报界说：茂物会议的成就十分有助于建立和平。关于和平共处的五项原则曾在茂物会议上提出来，这些原则也会在未来的亚非会议上提出来。
