Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 20th: DPA Dusseldorf reports: The Secretariat of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party issued a statement regarding the Soviet government's statement on the German question.

The statement pointed out: The Soviet government's new statement conforms to the wishes of millions of people in both East and West Germany, and points out to the German people the realistic possibility of a rapid solution to our country's urgent and important problems.

The statement said: Although the Soviet government's new proposal has refuted all the fallacies that have hitherto hindered negotiations for a peaceful settlement of the German question, Adenauer has repeatedly stated that he finds nothing surprising in this statement, considers it propaganda, and rejects it. At this moment when the most important decisions about our country's future should be made, anyone who does not seriously comprehend the Soviet proposal for negotiations does not want to seek mutual understanding.

The statement emphasized: Bonn should remove the item of ratifying the Paris Accords from the agenda. Holding negotiations on German reunification is a requirement of the situation. People everywhere are expressing their will to strive for negotiations with powerful actions.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 19th: French Communist Party Secretary Jacques Duclos gave a speech in Romorantin, Loir-et-Cher, calling on the French people to continue their struggle with confidence in final victory, to prevent the ratification of the Paris Accords and to block the evil path of atomic war.

Duclos emphasized the serious consequences that ratification of the Paris Accords would bring to the French people and the importance of continuing to work against these agreements that re-militarize West Germany. He said: Rejecting the Paris Accords would strike a blow against the vicious atomic war plans formulated for the North Atlantic Alliance.

Duclos called on workers and peasants to strengthen united action in the struggle to satisfy the demands of the working people and to safeguard peace.

    德共中央支持苏联关于德国问题的声明
    杜克洛号召法国人民阻止批准巴黎协定
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社柏林十九日讯：德意志通讯社杜塞尔多夫消息：德国共产党中央委员会书记处就苏联政府关于德国问题的声明发表声明。
    声明指出：苏联政府的新声明符合德国东、西两部分千百万人民的愿望，并且向德国人民指明迅速解决我国迫切重要问题的现实可能性。
    声明说：虽然苏联政府的新建议已经把一直到今天为止阻碍着谈判和平解决德国问题的各种谬论驳斥无遗，然而阿登纳还一再表示：他觉得这个声明没有什么惊人，认为这是宣传，而拒绝了这个声明。在这个应该对我国的未来作出最重要的决定的时刻，谁要是不认真地领会苏联关于谈判的建议，谁就是不想求得互相谅解。
    声明着重指出：波恩应当把批准巴黎协定这一个项目从议程上抹掉。举行关于德国统一的谈判是局势的要求。各地人民正以强大的行动来表示他们争取谈判的意志。
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十八日讯：法国共产党书记雅克·杜克洛在罗亚—舍尔省的罗莫朗登发表演说，号召法国人民满怀最后胜利的信心，继续斗争，以阻止巴黎协定的批准和阻塞原子战争的罪恶道路。
    杜克洛着重指出批准巴黎协定会给法国人民带来的严重后果和继续努力反对这些使西德重新军国主义化的协定的重要性。他说：否决巴黎协定就打击了对北大西洋联盟所制订的恶毒的原子战争计划。
    杜克洛号召工人和农民在争取满足劳动者的要求、争取维护和平的斗争中加强一致行动。
