The ironworkers of the Iron Smelting Department of the Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant achieved new successes in production during the first week of the year. In the first week, pig iron production fulfilled 105.95% of the plan, an increase of 7.3% compared with the same period in 1954; the quality of pig iron was also improved, with a pass rate of 100%.

Hou Decheng, a national industrial labor model and foreman of the Class A shift of the No. 2 Blast Furnace in the Iron Smelting Department, led all the workers in the shift to hold a meeting during their rest time on the 2nd to study specific ways to strive for greater achievements. He said: This year is the third year of the first Five-Year Plan, and the national construction tasks are greater than last year, and at the same time, the struggle to liberate Taiwan will be launched. The task of our steelworkers is to produce more iron. Since the beginning of New Year's Day, they have conscientiously implemented the Soviet Union's advanced experience of "searching and roasting," and the output of each furnace of iron has exceeded the plan. As of the 6th, the No. 2 Blast Furnace had overproduced more than 250 tons.

All the staff and workers of the No. 1 Blast Furnace put forward a plan for increasing production and practicing economy before the New Year's Eve on the 29th: to ensure an increase of 300 tons of pig iron in January, and strive to complete 500 tons; to reduce costs by 600 million yuan, and strive to complete 800 million yuan. After this plan was put forward, many workers made personal guarantee plans. Worker Bian Yinling has not returned home for eleven years, and he originally planned to ask for leave to go back and see his family this year. But he found the duty foreman and said: I can't let one person affect the production of the entire blast furnace, I won't go home. Li Zhenhua, a member of the Youth League in the furnace mouth team, suddenly ran to the duty room at twelve o'clock on New Year's Day. The duty foreman Song Yulin was very surprised and asked, "Li Zhenhua, you are off today, what are you doing here?" Li Zhenhua said, "Everyone is so busy, I really can't sit still at home." After speaking, he went to check the work everywhere. Through the efforts of all the staff and workers, the No. 1 Blast Furnace increased pig iron production by more than 120 tons and reduced costs by 100 million yuan from the 1st to the 6th.

The small blast furnace is shouldering the important task of experimenting with new ore smelting in January this year, and this task is very heavy. For example, the charging team usually only charges four or five batches of materials per hour, but now they have to charge seven or eight batches per hour. The workload has increased, and the number of people is still the same, but they have achieved "pots waiting for cars" and "cars waiting for materials" to ensure sufficient charging. The workers of the hot blast stove team carried out furnace ash cleaning work at 10:00 a.m. on the 6th to ensure the supply of wind temperature. All the workers in the group worked in the furnace at a high temperature of about 100 degrees Celsius, and their faces and backs were burned. But they still persisted in working for four hours until all the ash was cleared. They said: The sooner we finish cleaning, the sooner we can provide the small blast furnace with sufficient hot air.

### 北京炼铁工人今年第一周的新成就

    北京炼铁工人今年第一周的新成就
    北京石景山钢铁厂炼铁部的工人，在开年第一周就在生产上取得新的成就。第一周生铁完成计划百分之一百零五点九五，和一九五四年同期比较，增加了百分之七点三；生铁质量也提高了，合格率达到百分之一百。
    全国工业劳动模范、炼铁部二高炉甲班值班工长侯德成领导全班工人，趁二日轮休时间开会研究了争取作出更大的成绩的具体办法。他说：今年是第一个五年计划的第三个年头，国家建设任务比去年大了，同时要展开解放台湾的斗争。咱们钢铁工人的任务就是要多出铁。今年元旦开始，他们认真贯彻了苏联“边搜边烤”的先进经验，每一炉铁的产量都超过计划。到六日为止，二高炉已超产二百五十多吨。
    一高炉的全体职工在年前二十九日就提出了增产节约计划：保证一月份增产三百吨生铁，争取完成五百吨；降低成本六亿元，争取完成八亿元。这个计划提出后，许多工人都订出了个人保证计划。工人边银岭十一年没有回过家了，他本来准备今年请假回去看看。但是他找到值班工长说：不能因为我一个人影响整个高炉的生产，我不回家了。炉口小组工人、青年团员李振华，在元旦晚上十二点钟，忽然跑到值班室来了，值班工长宋玉林很奇怪，问道：“李振华，你今天休息，来干什么？”李振华说：“大伙那么紧张，我在家里实在坐不住。”说罢他就到各处查看工作。经过全体职工的努力，一高炉从一日到六日，增产生铁一百二十多吨，降低成本一亿元。
    小高炉今年一月份担负着试验用新矿石炼铁的重要任务，这个任务很繁重。比如上料小组，平时每小时只上四、五批料，现在每小时要上七、八批。工作任务加重了，人还是那么多，但是他们做到了“罐不等车”，“车不等料”，保证充足上料。热风炉小组工人为了保证供应风温，在六日上午十时，进行炉内清灰工作。全组工人在一百度左右高温的炉内工作，脸和背都被烤得疼起来了。但他们仍坚持工作四小时，直到把灰全部清完才出来。他们说：早一点清完，早一点供给小高炉充足的热风。
