    The “Journey” of a Suggestion

    To the Editor:
    In the Mechanical Department of the directly subordinate engineering company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, some comrades suffering from lung disease still eat and live with healthy comrades. On October 6th of last year, Jiang Shimin, a cadre of the Mechanical Department, suggested to the leadership that a comprehensive physical examination be conducted, that patients with infectious diseases be separated from everyone else during meals and accommodation, and that severely ill patients be given timely rest and treatment.
    This suggestion was submitted by the Mechanical Department to the Party Committee of the department for processing on October 7th. The Party Committee of the Mechanical Department then wrote to the Party Committee of the directly subordinate company, saying: "This suggestion is very good, but the issue is related to the entire company, please have the higher-level Party Committee consider and handle it."
    Deputy Secretary Mu of the Company Party Committee personally handled this suggestion. He instructed: "The suggestion is very good, please have the Organization Department and the administrative cadres section and health section carefully study and formulate treatment and recuperation methods for patients with chronic diseases."
    Minister Huang of the Company Party Committee Organization Department further instructed: "The Cadre Section should quickly contact relevant departments to study this issue."
    The Cadre Section, using the name of the Company Party Committee Organization Department, wrote a letter transferring the suggestion to the Salary and Welfare Section of the administrative Cadre Department, saying: "This suggestion is very good, please read it and jointly study and handle it with the trade union and other relevant departments."
    Section Chief Zheng of the Cadre Department's Salary and Welfare Section, upon receiving this suggestion, wrote a report: "The suggestion is very good, ... please instruct on the handling method."
    Department Head Wei of the Cadre Department wrote on the original report: "Return to the Party Committee Organization Department, transfer to the Health Section and the Administrative Welfare Section."
    The Party Committee Organization Department then transferred the suggestion to the Health Section. Section Chief Yu of the Health Section replied: "The suggestion is very good, but some issues are more complex, it is best for the trade union to convene a meeting of relevant departments to study it together."
    On November 30th, after traveling between the Party Committee and administrative departments for fifty-six days, this suggestion finally reached the Labor Protection Department of the trade union.
    This suggestion has been personally handled by several leading cadres, large and small, and has been repeatedly deemed "very good," so why is there still no practical result? People can once again learn a lesson from the "journey" of this suggestion: If the work done is only to report, approve, and transfer documents back and forth, no practical problem can ever be solved.

### 一项建议的“旅程”

    一项建议的“旅程”编辑同志：
    建筑工程部直属工程公司机械处有些患肺病的同志仍然同没病的同志一起吃饭、一起居住。去年十月六日机械处的干部姜士民向领导方面建议：进行一次全面的身体检查，让传染性病患者吃饭和住宿时同大家分开，让重患者及时休养和治疗。
    这项建议在十月七日由机械处交给机关党委处理。机械处机关党委就写信给直属公司党委说：“这个建议很好，但是问题关联到整个公司，请上级党委考虑处理。”
    公司党委牟副书记亲自处理了这个建议，他批示说： “建议很好，请组织部和行政方面的干部处、卫生处妥善研究，对慢性病患者拟定治疗、休养的办法。”
    公司党委组织部黄部长又批示说：“干部科速和有关部门联系，研究这个问题。”
    干部科就用公司党委组织部的名义写信把建议转给行政方面的干部处工资福利科，信里说：“这项建议很好，请阅后和工会等有关部门共同研究处理。”
    干部处工资福利科郑科长收到这个建议后，写了一个报告：“建议很好，……请处长指示处理办法。”
    干部处魏处长在原报告上批道：“退回党委组织部，转卫生处、行政福利处。”
    党委组织部又把建议转给了卫生处。卫生处余处长复信说：“建议很好，但有些问题比较复杂，最好由工会召开一个有关部门会议，共同研究。”
    十一月三十日，这个建议在党委和行政部门间旅行了五十六天以后，又到了工会劳动保护部。
    这个建议经过了大大小小好几个领导干部的亲手处理，又到处被认为“很好”，为什么还没有任何实际结果呢？人们从这个建议的“旅程”里可以再次得到一个教训：如果所做的工作光是把公文上报、下批、来回转，是永远不能解决任何实际问题的。 张强
