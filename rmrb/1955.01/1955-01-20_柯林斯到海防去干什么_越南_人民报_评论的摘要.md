Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 19th: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a commentary on the 18th entitled "What is Collins Doing in Haiphong?" saying: On January 12th, Collins, the master of Ely and Ngo Dinh Diem, arrived in Haiphong. Collins has many purposes in going to Haiphong, but the main two are: 1. To formulate a plan for French colonialists and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to intensify the destruction of Haiphong; 2. To promote the work of deceiving and forcing North Vietnamese residents, especially Haiphong citizens, to migrate to the South. The commentary said that currently, the French colonialists and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, who are undermining the armistice agreement, are stepping up their looting and theft of machinery, equipment, and utensils from many public institutions and enterprises in Haiphong to South Vietnam. The French colonialists and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique are also doing their best to lure and force Haiphong citizens to migrate to the South so that the United States can quickly establish six divisions of "police forces" for the Ngo Dinh Diem clique.

The commentary said that Collins' visit to Haiphong to directly order the French colonialists and the Ngo Dinh Diem puppet regime to run rampant once again proves the United States' arrogance and blatant interference in Vietnam. The commentary called on the residents of Haiphong to be vigilant, actively struggle, and smash Collins' conspiracy plans.

    柯林斯到海防去干什么
    ——越南“人民报”评论的摘要
    【新华社河内十九日电】越南“人民报”十八日以“柯林斯到海防去干什么？”为题发表评论说：一月十二日，埃利和吴庭艳的主子——柯林斯到了海防。柯林斯到海防去的目的很多，但主要的有两点：一、给法国殖民者和吴庭艳集团订出加强对海防进行破坏的计划；二、促进欺骗和强迫北越居民特别是海防市民南迁的工作。评论说，目前，破坏停战协定的法国殖民者和吴庭艳集团正在加紧把海防的许多公共机关、企业的机器、设备、用具等抢劫和盗窃到南越去。法国殖民者和吴庭艳集团还在竭力诱骗和强迫海防市民南迁，以使美国能迅速为吴庭艳集团建立起六个师的“警察部队”。
    评论说，柯林斯到海防去直接下令要法国殖民者和吴庭艳伪政权横行霸道，又一次证明了美国对越南的横蛮和露骨的干涉。评论号召海防居民提高警惕，积极斗争，粉碎柯林斯的阴谋计划。
