Why Get Angry?

Last year, on the afternoon of October 30th.

In the sixth district of Datong County, Qinghai Province, a quiet bank branch suddenly became a noisy place.

A cadre named Niu Yunlai acted as if he were in an empty place, rushing around, cursing and swearing. Carrying "a rifle and a pistol," he strode into the bank branch, and without saying a word, he burst into骂：“小资产阶级疯狂病，找到老子头上了！”“老子非枪毙他不可！”：“'Petty-bourgeois madness has found its way to me!' 'I will definitely shoot him!'" Niu Yunlai was aggressive and full of anger, to the point that several comrades could not stop him. He rushed straight into the district government's courtyard, pushed open the office door, and shouted for Tang Juming to come out and answer him. Fortunately, Comrade Tang Juming had gone to Xining for a meeting and was not there, thus avoiding a greater mistake.

Reader Han Fengchang wrote a letter to Qinghai Daily reflecting this situation (the letter was published in the Qinghai Daily on December 14th last year), stating that Niu Yunlai, as a cadre of the Qinghai Provincial Public Security Corps, should not, because district cadre Tang Juming criticized his wife, Wang Shuangning, in the Qinghai Daily, disregard military discipline and national law and retaliate against the critic! The reader also emphasized that the facts "criticized" in Comrade Tang Juming's sketch "The Quiet Bank Branch," published in the Qinghai Daily on October 27th last year, were "completely correct." The sketch stated:

	Monday morning. The sun was already shining on the mountaintops, and the students of the elementary school were about to finish their classes. However, Comrade Wang of the Datong Sixth District Branch of the People's Bank was still "sound asleep." An old乡who came to the branch to withdraw money had been standing there from dawn until the sun was high in the sky, calling out loudly and softly, but there was no response at all. All that could be heard from the room was a series of "thunderous snores." It was not until 10:30 in the morning that Comrade Wang hurriedly got out of bed and went to eat breakfast leisurely.

Niu Yunlai had long turned a blind eye to this "quiet bank branch" and his wife, Wang Shuangning's, irresponsible and lazy work style, and did not feel angry; but when others righteously exposed the truth in the newspaper, he changed his attitude, got angry, and wanted to retaliate against the critic. Who has the "petty-bourgeois madness"? Isn't that obvious?

In his self-criticism published in the Qinghai Daily on December 14th last year, Niu Yunlai also stated that his bourgeois individualism and arrogance were very serious. He "not only did not welcome others' correct criticism of himself, but even forbade others to criticize his lover." This rude attitude towards criticism is not only inconsistent with the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee but also contradicts the national constitution. This is not permissible for a revolutionary soldier, especially a Communist Party member. Therefore, the Qinghai Daily's struggle against Niu Yunlai's behavior of threatening critics is of great significance and has achieved some success. This is because, after a month of efforts by the newspaper, it urged the political department of the Qinghai Provincial Public Security Corps to conduct a serious criticism of Niu Yunlai's errors within the Party, helping him to recognize his errors and make a public self-criticism in the newspaper. At the same time, he was given an administrative warning and was ordered to go to the Datong Sixth District government and the bank branch to admit his mistakes to Tang Juming and others in person.

    为什么动肝火
    去年，十月三十日的下午。
    在青海大通县第六区，有个静悄悄的银行营业所，骤然间变成一个闹嚷嚷的场所。
    有个名唤牛运来的干部，在这个场所里似入无人之境，冲来撞去，骂三说四。他身带“一杆猎枪和一支手枪”，跨进银行营业所的大门，二话不说，便破口大骂：“小资产阶级疯狂病，找到老子头上了！”“老子非枪毙他不可！”牛运来气势汹汹，满肚子怒气，以致几个同志拦阻也拦阻不住，又直冲到区政府的院子里，一手推开办公室的门，大叫大喊着要找唐聚明出来答话。所幸唐聚明同志已去西宁开会，没有碰上，这才避免铸成更大错误。
    读者韩凤昌把这种情形写信反映给青海日报（信登在去年十二月十四日的青海日报上），说牛运来身为青海省公安总队的一个干部，绝不应因区干部唐聚明在青海日报上批评了他的妻子——王双宁，就这般无视军纪国法，对批评者施行报复！读者还着重指出，唐聚明同志在去年十月二十七日青海日报上写的小品文“静悄悄的银行营业所”，其中所“批评的事实是完全正确的”。小品文中说：
    星期一早晨。太阳已经照上了山尖，完小的学生也快下课了。可是，人民银行大通六区营业所的王同志，还在“酣然大睡”。一个到营业所取款的老乡，从拂晓一直站到日出三竿，高声叫低声唤，都没一点动静，从屋里传送出来的只是一阵阵“雷似的鼾声”。到上午十点半钟，王同志才匆匆起了床，不慌不忙地去吃饭。
    牛运来对于如此这般“静悄悄的银行营业所”，和自己的妻子王双宁如此这般不负责任的懒惰作风，长时间熟视无睹，不感到气愤；而当别人在报纸上严正地揭露了事实的真相后，他却改变常态，动了肝火，要找批评者进行报复。究竟谁有“小资产阶级的疯狂病”，难道这还不明显吗？
    牛运来去年十二月十四日在青海日报上所作的检讨中，也曾表明他的资产阶级个人主义思想和骄傲情绪，是很严重的。他“不但不欢迎别人对自己的正确批评，甚至也不许别人批评自己的爱人”。这种对待批评的粗暴态度，不仅同党的四中全会决议的精神不相符合，并且同国家宪法相抵触。而这对一个革命军人特别是一个共产党员来说是不能允许的。因此，青海日报向牛运来这种威胁批评者的行为所作的斗争，是有重要意义的，并且已取得一定的成效。这就是经过报社一个月来的努力，督促青海省公安总队政治部在党内对牛运来的错误进行了严肃的批判，帮助他认识了自己的错误并在报纸上作了公开检讨。同时在行政上给予他以警告处分，并要他到大通六区区政府和银行营业所向唐聚明等当面承认错误。
