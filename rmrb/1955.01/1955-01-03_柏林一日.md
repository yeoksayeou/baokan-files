    A Day in Berlin
    Tian Jian
    One morning, we walked near a large building. Several people stopped here. The place where they stopped was in the middle of a street in Berlin. Our German friend said:
    “We can’t go any further.”
      “Why?”
    “A few more steps and we’ll be in West Berlin.”
    “Ah, I see.”
    This place was a dividing line. On the other side of the dividing line, that is, to the west, stood a wooden sign with the words "American Occupation Zone" written on it. I looked at these things in astonishment. Berlin had been cut into pieces like this, as if with a knife. Berlin, with over seven hundred years of history, was so unfortunate as to have such a mark branded upon it.
    The entire city of Berlin is a ring-shaped structure. Its land is a ring-shaped area, like a plate. This plate in the hands of the German people has a crack. Therefore, its people, tens of millions of hands, are raising it high, wanting to remove this crack, wanting to fill it in.
    Looking across the street where we were standing, the opposite side didn't seem like a street at all. Desolation, darkness, and terror enveloped it. I couldn't help but wonder: "Are you—also Berlin?"
    The modern German poet Bertolt Brecht, many years ago, wrote a long poem called "Hunger City," which contained these lines:
      “The starving city, like a vast tomb,
    Lines of benches, on which sit the starving poor,
    They dream of honey and milk,
    And feast on them in tempting dreams.”
    “Underground lurk vile taverns,
    Winding underground like pitfalls.
    There, fat and mushrooms are swallowed with wine,
    The air is thick, but only with fleeting smells.”
    “The high sky covers the dead like a broken bowl,
    An air coffin, a crystal tomb.
    Mouths agape, tongues stretched long,
    They starved to death, even into the underworld.”
      This poem is still a portrayal of Berlin, it is West Berlin. Another enthusiastic poet, Kuba, who lived in West Berlin, told me that there were many wooden boards on the streets and at the corners of walls. Lifting these wooden boards revealed cellars where many people lived. Now, West Berlin was before my eyes. Thinking of Brecht's poem and Kuba's words, I felt that poets are witnesses of history, witnesses of Berlin. I believe their words.
    The large building I mentioned earlier, which is on this side of the dividing line, was originally a large department store in the German Democratic Republic. The "June 17th Incident" happened here. The steel and iron doors and windows of the building had been burned down by the imperialist conspirators. Those doors and windows now seemed to be watching the other side with vigilant eyes, with resentful eyes.
    Standing in this place, we gazed for a long time. While watching, we asked: "Can people from West Berlin come over here?" Our German friend told us: "People with identification cards can come over." We asked again: "What do they come over for?"
    He replied:
    "Some people live here. Others come to buy things and to see Stalin Avenue."
    Then he smiled at us:
    "Not only do ordinary citizens want to come and see, but the rich people in West Berlin also want to come sightseeing."
    "I heard that Adenauer wants to have a competition with East Berlin, is that right?"
      "I haven't seen his advertisement. I've heard about it too. If so, he's not qualified. Before he even thinks about competing, he's already a loser!"
    That same afternoon, we arrived at Stalin Avenue. - What a bright place! It was like a pure white painting, displayed around us.
    A pure white painting. A magnificent painting. On its surface, there was no filth, no bloodstains. No bullet holes. No traces of shelling. And no cellars (there is an underground tramway). Without a doubt, this is a symbol of socialism.
    On the wide street, apart from the red flowerbeds and green leaves, everything else was white. Like a great river, it flowed quietly there. The tall streetlights were also like white flowers, floating on the water. On this street, not only are there Stalin's name and his bronze statue, but Stalin's ideals and friendship are also alive here.
    One end of the street is Textile Workers' Square. The other end is Marx-Engels Square. On both sides of the square, there are two highest buildings, like a pair of stone towers standing side by side, creating a natural gateway for this street. According to the architect Karl Menzel, the most beautiful sculptures will also be placed in this area. This is a working-class residential area.
    An old lady led us to visit several rooms upstairs. I won't mention the beautiful wooden bed and radio; the most fascinating thing was that the garbage could be disposed of automatically. People upstairs and downstairs could talk to each other without going through doors and windows, just by pressing a number.
    In addition, at the entrance of a children's store, there was an electric light advertisement, made by the architect Henkielmann. Its emblem was the Berlin city emblem, the "Bear." There was a lot of discussion about whether or not to have an electric light advertisement. Some people said yes, and the citizens also supported it, saying it was needed; some people said no, saying it was capitalist. As a result, this professor created a new method.
    The towering buildings, the giant Stalin bronze statue, the tall streetlights, are all so good. Especially the workers moving from their small buildings to the large buildings, which in the eyes of many people, is a miracle of Berlin. It shook Berlin.
    When the project was still underway, many people from West Berlin came to visit on their own. Next to some construction projects, some people asked:
    "Did the government ask you to come here for propaganda purposes?"
    Those volunteers who participated in voluntary labor pointed to the ministers working on the construction site and said:
    "The government ministers are also working here, who asked them to come? -- We are all voluntary. We all work here for two or three hours every day."
    Some people also asked:
    "So, who paid for it? Did the government pay for it?"
    "To commemorate Stalin, this street is not paid for by the government, we all paid for it. Look, there are so many of us, if each person pays a little, isn't that enough?"
    In such questions and answers, the workers of the German Democratic Republic handed the bricks in their hands to them: "If you are willing, you are welcome to join us."
      Some people from West Berlin immediately took the brick in their hands. They also participated in this collective labor, this glorious collective undertaking. The German people's footsteps are walking together on this street.
    After the project was completed (what has been completed now is the central area of the street, only this section is two kilometers long, and there are still five kilometers to be built in the future), more people came to visit from all over West Germany. At first, there were more than fifty people every Sunday, and later it gradually increased to more than three thousand people every Sunday.
    According to Premier Grotewohl, these visitors are all welcome guests of the German Democratic Republic. In the hearts of the German people, Germany is, after all, only one, and can only be one. I also wish here that in the near future, every German who loves the motherland will be able to come to Stalin Avenue to take a look and take a walk; if they can live in the building, that would be a kind of happiness.
    Here, I would like to add that the Stalin Avenue project plan was designed by six famous architects. They put a lot of thought into building a new Berlin. They once said with emotion:
    "How long does it take to build up after a night of destruction!"
    This is emotion, but also resentment. Fortunately, their emotion is not pessimistic, and their hard work has already yielded results. Friends from China are excitedly studying it -- one of the masterpieces of the German people -- Stalin Avenue.
    In 1953, European architects held a conference. At the conference, someone asked: "What is the most famous modern construction project in Europe (except for the Soviet Union)?"
    Someone replied at the time: "Stalin Avenue!"
    We walked on this street several times. Every time, when I looked up at the Stalin bronze statue, at Berlin under construction, I paid tribute to Berlin:
    -- Berlin, I wish you well! Berlin, I wish you an early reunification and greater prosperity! Berlin, I wish you to take big steps, walking on Stalin Avenue, towards socialism and communism!

### 柏林一日
田间

    柏林一日
    田间
    一天上午，我们走到一座大楼的附近。几个人在这里站下来。站的这地方，是柏林的一条大街的中段。德国的朋友说了：
    “不能再往前走了。”
      “怎么？”
    “往前再走几步路，就是西柏林。”
    “呵，原来如此。”
    这个地方，就是一个分界线。分界线的那边，也就是西边，插着一块木头牌子，上面写着“美国占领区”几个字。我很惊异地望着这些东西，柏林就是这样被切成几片，像用刀切开了似的。柏林，有七百多年的历史，在它的历史上，是这样的不幸，烙上这么一块印记。
    柏林全城是一个环式建筑。它的土地是一块环形地带，好像是一个盘子。德意志人民手上的这一个盘子，有了裂痕了。所以，它底人民，几千万双手都在高举着，要去掉这裂痕，要把它填平呵。
    沿着我们脚下所站的这一条街，我们望过去，对面的地方，好像不是街道，荒凉、阴暗和恐怖在笼罩着。我不禁疑问：“你——也是柏林吗？”
    现代的德国诗人贝希尔，在多年以前，写过一首长诗，名叫“饥饿之城”，其中有这样的诗句：
      “饿着的城市，正如庞大的坟墓，
    列着台凳，凭坐着挨饿的穷人，
    他们梦见蜜浆和牛乳，
    在逗人的梦里饱餐一顿。”
    “地下窟藏着下流的酒店，
    像陷坑那样在地底蜿蜒。
    那儿肥肉和蕈子和着酒吞，
    空气浓郁，也只是气味一阵。”
    “高高的天空破钵般覆着死人，
    空气的棺材，水晶似的坟墓。
    张着大口，舌头长伸，
    他们饿杀了，一直饿到阴间。”
      这首诗，仍然是柏林的一个写照，它就是西柏林。另一位热情的诗人库巴，在西柏林住过，他对我说，那儿在大街上、在墙角边，有很多木板，掀开这些木板，就是地窖，有很多的人在住着。现在，西柏林就在我底眼前，我想着贝希尔的诗和库巴的话，觉得诗人是历史的证人，是柏林的证人。我相信他们的话。
    刚才说的那座大楼，它是在分界线的这边，原来是德意志民主共和国的一个大商店。“六月十七日事件”就发生在这里。大楼上，钢和铁的门窗，已经被帝国主义的阴谋分子所烧毁。那些门和窗，现在仿佛用警惕的眼睛、愤恨的眼睛，在望着那一边。
    站在这个地方，我们久久地望着。一边看，一边又问：“西柏林的人可以从这儿过来吗？”德国的朋友告诉我们说：“有身份证的人，可以过来。”我们又问：“他们过来干什么？”
    他回答了：
    “有的人是住在这边。还有的人要来买东西，和看斯大林大街。”
    这时他对我们笑了一笑：
    “不仅市民想要来看看，西柏林的阔人也要来观光。”
    “听说阿登纳要和东柏林来一个竞赛是不是？”
      “我没有看到他的广告。也是听说。如果是，他没有这个资格。在他还没有想起竞赛以前，他就是一个竞赛的失败者！”
    就在同一天的下午，我们到了斯大林大街。——好光明的地方呵！它像一幅洁白的画图，陈列在我们身边。
    洁白的画图。壮丽的画图。在它底上面，没有一点污秽，没有血迹。没有枪眼。没有弹痕。也没有地窖（有地下电车道）。毫无疑问，这是社会主义的象征。
    宽阔的街道上，除了红的花坛、绿的树叶而外，其余的都是白色。如同一条大江似的，在那儿静静地流着。高大的街灯，也像白的花，浮在水面上。在这一条大街上，不仅有斯大林的名字和他的铜像，斯大林的理想、友谊，也在这里活着。
    街的一头是纺织工人广场。另一头是马克思—恩格斯广场，广场的两旁，有两座最高的大楼，如同一对石塔并立着，给这一条大街做了一道自然的门。据建筑家卡尔·门采尔说，在这一带，还要设置最美的雕塑品。这儿都是工人住宅区。
    一位老太太引着我们，在楼上参观了几间房子。漂亮的木床和收音机，我就不说了；最引入胜的是，垃圾可以用自动器倒出去；楼上和楼下的人，不用经过门窗，只要按一个号码，就可以互相说话。
    另外，在一家儿童商店门口，有一个电灯广告，这是建筑家亨基尔曼做的，它采用的标帜，就是柏林的城徽“熊”。当初要不要电灯广告，是讨论得很多的。有人说要，市民也在一旁支持说要；有人说不能要，说这是资本主义的。结果是，这位教授创造了一个新办法。
    耸天的高楼，巨大的斯大林铜像，高高的街灯，都是这样的好。尤其是工人从他们的小楼里搬到大楼上，这在许多人来看，是柏林的一个奇迹。它震动了柏林。
    当工程还在进行时，西柏林有许多人自动来参观了。在一些建筑工程的旁边，他们有人问：
    “是不是政府为了宣传才叫你们来的？”
    那些志愿参加义务劳动的人，指着在工地上劳动的部长说：
    “政府的部长也在这里工作哩，是谁叫他们来的？——我们都是自愿的。每天两三个小时都在这里工作。”
    也还有一些人这么问：
    “那么，谁出的钱呢？是不是政府出钱？”
    “为了纪念斯大林，这一条大街，不用政府出钱，我们大家出钱。看看吧，我们这么多人，一个人出一点，不就够了吗？”
    在这样的问答之中，德意志民主共和国的工人把手里的砖递给他们：“你们愿意的话，欢迎你们也来参加。”
      西柏林的人，有的当下就用手接过这一块砖。他们也参加了这个集体劳动，这个光荣的集体事业。德意志人民的步伐，在这一条大街上，走在一起。
    工程告一段落以后，（现在所完成的，是大街的中心地带，仅这一段，有两公里长，还有五公里，今后要继续施工，）西德各地来参观的人就更多。开始是每一个星期天有五十多人，后来逐渐增加，每一个星期天有三千多人。
    来参观的这些人，照格罗提渥总理的话说，都是受德意志民主共和国欢迎的客人。在德国人民的心中，德国毕竟只是一个，也只能是一个。我在这里也预祝着，不久的将来，每一个热爱祖国的德国人，都能到斯大林大街来看一看，来走一走；如果能在大楼上住一住，那将是一种幸福。
    这里，我想附带说一下，斯大林大街的工程计划，是六个著名的建筑家设计的。为了建设一个新的柏林，他们费的心思很不少。他们曾经感慨地说过：
    “一夜的破坏，需要多久的建设呵！”
    这是感慨，也是愤恨。好在他们的感慨并不是悲观，他们的辛苦也已经有了收获。来自中国的朋友，正在兴奋地观摩它——这德国人民的杰作之一——斯大林大街。
    在一九五三年，欧洲的建筑家举行过一个会议。会议上有人问：“欧洲（除了苏联而外）现代最有名的建筑工程是什么？”
    当时有人回答说：“斯大林大街！”
    我们在这一条大街上走过几次。每一次，当我抬起头来望着斯大林的铜像，望着在建设中的柏林，我都在向柏林致意：
    ——柏林呵，祝你好！柏林呵，祝你早日恢复统一，更加繁荣！柏林呵，祝你迈起大步，在斯大林大街上走着，走向社会主义和共产主义！
              （一九五四年十一月五日，追记）
