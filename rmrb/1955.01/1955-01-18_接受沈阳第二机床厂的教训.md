Learn from the Lessons of Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Factory
    Zhong Da
    Constantly improving product quality is the most important and frequent task of our business management. The quality of products is one of the decisive indicators for measuring the achievements of an enterprise's production. An enterprise that frequently produces defective products will seriously waste the country's wealth, because it consumes materials, tools, fuel, power, and labor in production without any economic results. Such an enterprise cannot accumulate funds for the country; on the contrary, it has to rely on national loans to survive, losing its active role in the construction cause!

    The Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Factory is such an enterprise. Its product quality has always been poor, resulting in wasted funds, disrupted production plans, stockpiled products, and the need to rely on bank loans to maintain production. Furthermore, they have brought many difficulties to other enterprises. Because many machine tools are of poor quality and inefficient, they cannot guarantee the smooth production of the using units; some capital construction units have also had to order goods from abroad because the factory could not deliver on time or guarantee quality, and some key projects could not be completed on schedule for construction and installation.

    The fundamental reason for this problem at the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Factory lies in errors in its business philosophy. The administrative and technical leaders of this factory, in order to simply pursue the quantity of products, even installed scrapped parts on machine tools; failed to conduct strict inspections of products for a long time; and "turned a deaf ear" to criticisms from users, allowing unqualified machine tools to leave the factory. This behavior, which does not focus on fully completing the national plan, disregards overall interests, and only considers the interests of the enterprise, is essentially a reflection of bourgeois business ideology in our enterprises.

    Improving product quality is of great significance to national construction. It is required of all enterprise departments to deeply remember the lessons of the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Factory, earnestly strengthen technical management, improve and enhance product quality, and comprehensively complete the national plan to ensure the successful progress of socialist industrialization!

    接受沈阳第二机床厂的教训
    重达
    不断地提高产品质量，是我们企业管理最重要、最经常的任务。产品质量的好坏，是衡量企业生产成就的决定性的指标之一。一个常常生产废品的企业，会严重地浪费国家的财富，因为它在生产中消耗了材料、工具、燃料、动力、劳动，收不到任何经济效果。这样的企业便不可能为国家积累资金，反而要靠国家的贷款过活，使自己在建设事业中失去了积极的作用！
    沈阳第二机床厂就是这样的一个企业，它的产品质量一贯低劣，结果浪费了资金、打乱了生产计划、积压了产品、不得不靠银行的贷款维持生产。再就是，他们还给其他企业带去了很多困难。因为许多质量不好、效率不高的机床，无法保证使用单位顺利进行生产；一些基本建设单位，也因为该厂不能按期交货、不能保证质量，不得不到国外定货，某些重点工程便不能按期完成建筑安装工作。
    沈阳第二机床厂所以发生这个问题，其根本原因在于经营思想上有错误。这个厂里的行政领导干部和技术领导干部，为了单纯追求产品数量，竟把已报废的零件装到机床上；长期不对产品进行严格的检查；对使用单位提出的批评“充耳不闻”，让不合格的机床出厂等。这种不以全面完成国家计划为念，不顾整体利益、单想到本企业的利益的行为，实质上是资产阶级经营思想在我们企业中的反映。
    提高产品质量，对于国家建设是有重大意义的。要求一切企业部门，深深记取沈阳第二机床厂的教训，切实加强技术管理，改善和提高产品质量，全面地完成国家计划，以保证社会主义工业化的胜利进行！
