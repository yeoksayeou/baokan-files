Xinhua News Agency: The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently instructed rural Party organizations at all levels to address the issue of surplus livestock power in agricultural production cooperatives by developing diversified economic undertakings, correcting the idea of underestimating the role of cattle and donkeys in cooperatives, so as to consolidate agricultural production cooperatives and benefit the development of production.

Since the summer of last year, agricultural production cooperatives in Hebei Province have developed significantly. To date, the number of new households joining the cooperatives has reached more than 25% of the total number of farm households. Many of these are households with a large amount of livestock power. As a result, many cooperatives have a varying degree of surplus livestock power after renting the members' draught animals for unified use. Some members' draught animals (cattle and donkeys or small draught animals) have not been rented. No way out has been pointed out for the livestock that have not been rented, so some people have sold their livestock. In addition, many agricultural production cooperatives, without considering the actual conditions, are eager to replace cattle and donkeys with mules and horses, taking out loans to buy mules and horses, and are unwilling to rent members' cattle and donkeys, which has also prompted some members to sell their cattle and donkeys.

In response to this situation, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently instructed rural Party organizations at all levels that, when consolidating agricultural production cooperatives, in addition to correctly implementing policies and properly handling the issue of members' draught animals joining the cooperatives, it is necessary to widely publicize to members and farmers that livestock is not currently excessive, but rather insufficient. It should be clearly stated that in order to increase agricultural production, it is necessary to plough deeply and accumulate more fertilizer, as well as increase livestock products, which requires raising more livestock. For members' livestock that is not needed for agricultural production and there is indeed a surplus, it is necessary to organize diversified economic undertakings according to possible conditions, adapting to local conditions and time, to find production and breeding outlets for the livestock. At present, it is necessary to organize winter transportation sideline businesses to use cattle and donkey carts to carry out short-distance transportation of grain and industrial products for the state, so as to increase members' income and solve the feed problem. For the operation of livestock, if members have the strength to operate individually, they should be mobilized to operate properly. Cooperatives can also help members with livestock to organize mutual aid grazing, so as to solve the difficulty of insufficient grazing power for livestock households, so as to develop animal husbandry. At the same time, members should be educated to clearly recognize that cattle and donkeys will remain one of the main traction forces for agricultural production for a considerable period of time, and must not be underestimated. It is necessary to give full play to the potential of existing livestock, and not to prematurely exclude cattle and donkeys or blindly purchase mules and horses without considering the conditions, so as to avoid excessive debt for the cooperatives and affect the income and consolidation of the cooperatives.

    热河着手解决农业合作社畜力剩余问题
    据新华社讯：中共热河省委员会最近指示各级农村党组织，从组织多种经营着手解决农业生产合作社的畜力剩余问题，纠正合作社轻视牛、驴作用的思想，以巩固农业生产合作社和有利于生产的发展。
    去年夏季以来，热河省的农业生产合作社有很大发展。到目前止，新入社的农户已达总农户的百分之二十五以上。其中有很多是畜力较多的农户。因此，有很多合作社把社员的耕畜租进社来统一使用后，在畜力上有了程度不同的剩余。有些社员的耕畜（牛和驴或小耕畜）就未被租用。对未被租用的牲畜，也未指出出路，因而有些人就把牲畜卖掉。此外，还有不少农业生产合作社，不根据实际条件，急于用骡、马代替牛、驴，贷款购买骡、马，不愿租用社员的牛、驴，也促使部分社员把牛、驴卖掉。
    根据这种情况，中共热河省委员会最近指示各级农村党组织，在整顿农业生产合作社时，除正确贯彻政策合理处理社员耕畜入社问题外，要向社员和农民广泛宣传：目前，牲畜不是多了，而是不足。要明确交代：想使农业增产，就必须深耕和多积肥，还要增产畜产品，这样，就必须多养牲畜。对社员的牲畜，农业生产使用不了确有剩余的，要根据可能条件，因地因时制宜地组织多种经营，给牲畜找生产和饲养的出路。当前，要有组织地开展冬季运输副业，使用牛车驴车为国家进行粮食和工业品的短途运输，以增加社员收入和解决饲料问题。对牲畜的经营，社员个人有力经营者，应发动个人妥善经营。合作社并可帮助有畜社员组织互助放牧，以解决有畜户放养力量不足的困难，以发展畜牧业。同时，要教育社员明确认识牛、驴在一个相当长的时期内仍是农业生产主要牵引动力之一，绝不能轻视。要发挥现有牲畜潜力，不要过早的排除牛、驴和不根据条件盲目的购买骡、马，以免使合作社负债过多，影响社员收入和社的巩固。
