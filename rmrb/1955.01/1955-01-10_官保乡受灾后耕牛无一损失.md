Guanbao Township in Songzi County, Hubei Province, has achieved great success in protecting draught cattle. Last year, Guanbao Township suffered severe damage due to the breach of the river embankment. In a series of disaster relief efforts including flood prevention, emergency rescue and resettlement, and post-flood winter planting, the township government always emphasized mobilizing the masses to provide emergency rescue and resettlement for draught cattle. Through the People's Representatives' Congress, preparations were further improved for cattle sheds and feed for protection against the cold winter. This ensured the safety of all 221 draught cattle in the township, maintained the vitality of production, and laid a reliable material foundation for striving for a bumper harvest.

In order to further solve the difficulties of cattle housing and forage, the People's Government has recently allocated 20 million yuan in draught cattle loans to lend to the masses for buying grass and stockpiling it for protection against the cold winter.

    官保乡受灾后耕牛无一损失
    湖北省松滋县官保乡保护耕牛取得巨大成绩。官保乡去年因江堤溃口，受灾严重，在防汛抢险、急救安置和退水冬播等一系列的生产救灾过程中，由于乡政府始终重视了发动群众急救安置耕牛，通过人民代表大会会议进一步作好了防寒过冬的牛栏、饲料准备，从而保证了全乡二百二十一条耕牛的安全，保持了生产元气，为争取丰收打下了可靠的物质基础。
    为了进一步解决耕牛住栏、草料困难，最近人民政府又拨来了耕牛贷款二千万元，贷给群众买草蓄备，防寒过冬。
