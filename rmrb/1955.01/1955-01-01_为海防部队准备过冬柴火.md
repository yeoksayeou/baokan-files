In the forested areas of Nanping, Gutian, and Youxi counties along the Min River in Fujian Province, a large number of forest farmers are enthusiastically preparing firewood for the coastal defense troops to get through the winter. Over the past period, in the third and fourth districts of Nanping County alone, which are located along the river, hundreds of agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams have signed contracts with local supply and marketing cooperatives to supply 1.6 million bundles of firewood (14 catties per bundle). Forest farmers in eighteen townships along the Youxi County creek have also devoted themselves to firewood harvesting. Currently, piles of charcoal and firewood are everywhere along the Min River, and hundreds of wooden sailboats and steamers are transporting this firewood to the front lines.

The forest farmers in the forest areas regard this matter as their own glorious task. Although northern Fujian has entered the severe winter season and the forests are very cold, the forest farmers go into the mountains every day to harvest. They say: "The front lines need grain and we have grain; they need firewood and we have firewood. As long as we are here, we will not let the front lines lack food or firewood."

    为海防部队准备过冬柴火
    福建省闽江流域沿岸南平、古田、尤溪等县林区，大批林农正踊跃地为海防前线部队准备过冬柴火。在过去一段时间中，单南平县靠江的三、四两区就有成百个农业生产合作社、互助组同当地供销合作社签订了供应木柴一百六十万把（每把十四斤）的合同，尤溪县沿溪十八个乡林农也都投入砍伐木柴工作。目前，在闽江沿岸到处都堆满着薪炭和木柴，数以百计的木帆船和汽船正把这些木柴源源运往前线。
    林区林农都把这件事当成是自己的光荣任务。虽然闽北已届严冬季节，森林里很寒冷，但林农们每天都进山采伐。他们说：“前线要粮有粮，要柴火有柴火，有我们就不让前线缺粮缺柴。”
