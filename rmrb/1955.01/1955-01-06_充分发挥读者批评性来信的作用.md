Giving full play to the role of critical letters from readers is an important prerequisite for widely attracting the masses to conduct criticism, especially bottom-up criticism, in newspapers. The more critical letters come from the masses, the more it helps newspapers attract the masses, carry out bottom-up criticism, and conduct self-education among the masses. However, newspapers cannot publish all incoming letters in the newspaper. This requires comrades in various departments of the editorial department to carefully study readers' letters, and in addition to selecting some that can be published separately, they should also make full use of the materials, clues, viewpoints, and problems in the critical letters to write various articles, correcting the practice of simply "pushing away" critical letters. The practice of the Shanghai Labor Daily shows that as long as they are good at thinking of various ways to use critical letters, they can give full play to the role of these letters and effectively launch bottom-up criticism.

To give full play to the role of critical letters from readers, we must be good at discovering universal problems from individual problems. This requires comrades who handle letters to conduct repeated research and necessary investigations on the issues raised in the letters, based on the actual situation and the Party's policies and guidelines, in order to thoroughly clarify their relationship with the current work of the state and the lives of the broad masses. As long as we can truly distinguish these relationships, it will not be difficult to judge whether the criticism raised by the readers is an individual problem or a universal problem. For example, when the editorial department of the Shanghai Labor Daily handled the letter criticizing the state-owned Cotton Textile Factory No. 1 for dismissing temporary worker Gao Peifen without reason in January 1953, they not only found that this practice violated labor laws based on the results of their research on the Shanghai Interim Measures for Hiring Temporary Workers and the Interim Measures for Hiring Employees, but also found that the phenomenon of hiring or dismissing temporary workers without going through the labor department was quite common based on their investigation and research on the state-owned Cotton Textile Factories No. 11 and 19. After the newspaper discovered that this was a universal problem, it published a "Letter Summary" on April 22, 1953, pointing out that "the situation of hiring temporary workers in some state-owned cotton textile factories is very chaotic." Three days after the publication of this "Letter Summary," the East China Textile Administration notified all its state-owned cotton textile factories to pay attention to inspection and rectification, and formed a special team with the local trade union and labor department to conduct key inspections in the state-owned Cotton Textile Factories No. 7 and 10. This made a letter about an "individual problem" play a greater role. This example vividly illustrates that as long as newspapers are willing to conduct investigations and research based on the issues raised in the letters, it is not impossible to discover universal problems from letters about "individual problems." However, many comrades who handle letters have some incorrect understandings that hinder them from making such efforts. For example, some comrades believe that: "The number of letters on this issue is small, it is an individual problem, not a universal problem, and it is not worth publishing." The number of letters is indeed a sign to measure whether it is a universal problem, but it is not the only sign. Because, under the circumstances that the mass work foundation of the newspaper is weak, it is difficult for readers to reflect all the universal problems that occur in work and life to the newspaper within a certain period of time. At the same time, many problems, when they begin to sprout, are only manifested in individual problems, and have not developed universally. The broad masses may not be able to see them clearly, but they are happening, developing, and showing a trend, which is very worthy of attention; or although it is an individual problem, it is of great importance, and the newspaper can conduct universal education to readers through this individual problem. The newspaper editorial department should be good at identifying this trend, correctly estimating its educational significance, and should not formally decide and deal with problems based on the number of letters. Of course, in a sense, there are indeed some critical letters that have little relationship with the state's work, the Party's policies, and the lives of the broad masses, or only need to be resolved individually and do not need to be published publicly. This requires the comrades who handle letters to be able to analyze specific problems specifically, starting from reality and policies.

To give full play to the role of critical letters from readers, we must be good at revealing the essence of things through phenomena, and refine them to the appropriate policy level. Discovering universal problems is just raising the problems. As for the nature of this problem, it needs to be analyzed and studied essentially through phenomena, refined and summarized, and handled according to the Party's line and policy. For example, after the editorial department of the Shanghai Labor Daily received many letters from readers criticizing the "Biao Hui" phenomenon prevalent among the working masses in December 1953, although they found that this was a universal problem, what exactly was "Biao Hui"? Why did some workers participate in "Biao Hui"? Did the activities of "Biao Hui" violate the policy? The readers did not explain it very clearly in their letters. Nevertheless, the editorial department of the Shanghai Labor Daily did not give up thinking of ways to use these letters. The editorial department of the Shanghai Labor Daily sent people to conduct investigations and research in factories such as the Xinhua Iron and Steel Plant, the China Textile Machinery Factory, the Shanghai Cigarette Factory No. 4, and the Xinzong Power Machinery Factory, and found out that the "Biao Hui" was engaged in exploitation by means of usury; it found out that the reason why some workers participated in the "Biao Hui" was the result of being eroded by bourgeois ideology. When the newspaper clarified "What is Biao Hui? How to correctly solve the Biao Hui problem" in the form of "Talking about Letters" on January 30 and 31, 1954, it also required the working masses to draw a clear ideological line and improve their socialist consciousness based on the principle of self-education, in order to solve the problem of participating in the "Biao Hui" by means of mutual aid savings. After the newspaper supplemented and refined in this way, affirmed the nature of the problem, and raised it to the appropriate policy level, these letters that originally did not explain the problem essentially could not only be used by the newspaper, but also played a greater role. In the two letters published in the Shanghai Labor Daily on May 31, 1954, it reflected the effectiveness it had achieved in actual work: Among the workers of the China Textile Machinery Factory and a certain shipyard, the "Biao Hui" had been replaced by mutual aid savings associations.

To give full play to the role of critical letters from readers, we must be good at combining critical letters with central tasks as much as possible, but we cannot limit ourselves to central tasks. In terms of the focus of criticism, there is no doubt that the newspaper editorial department should pay close attention to combining it with the central task, and try to select letters in this regard for publication, in order to guide the attention of the masses to the central aspects of national work and the lives of the masses. After the Shanghai Labor Daily put forward the general line, because it used readers' letters to expose the blindness in production, the corruption in business management, especially the poor product quality and poor working conditions of private medium and small factories, it attracted the attention of the staff and workers to the central task of carrying out socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. However, in national work and the lives of the masses, the central task is not the only one. In addition to the central task, there are a series of tasks surrounding the central task, as well as other tasks. These many tasks constitute the rich diversity of national work and the lives of the masses, and constitute the rich diversity of the problems reflected in the readers' letters. There are criticisms mainly based on the central task, and there are also criticisms on all aspects of national work and the lives of the masses. Therefore, if we only one-sidedly emphasize combining with the central task, and ignore the criticisms surrounding the central task, on various aspects of national work and major problems in the lives of the masses, it will also limit the enthusiasm of the masses, affect the newspaper's broad contact with the masses, and even affect the smooth development of the central task because of losing the supervision and criticism of the masses on various tasks. For example, the Shanghai Labor Daily once received some letters from readers criticizing that the order in some workers' dormitories was not good, affecting sleep, some basic construction workers left their posts without permission, and some capitalists abused workers. From the phenomenon, these problems did not seem to be any central task. Therefore, the newspaper did not publish these critical letters in time. However, after inspection, it was found that these were closely related to the current production problem. Insufficient sleep for workers will affect attendance and hinder production; basic construction workers leaving their posts without permission will affect national construction; capitalists abusing workers will not only affect the enthusiasm of workers in production, but also affect the transformation of the bourgeoisie. This fully illustrates that if the newspaper wants to give full play to the role of critical letters, it must be good at organically combining the criticism of central tasks with the criticism of general tasks. As for how to better combine, according to the experience of the Shanghai Labor Daily, that is, the comrades who handle letters must be able to distinguish the inherent connection between the central task and other tasks, be able to recognize the characteristics of readers' letters widely reflecting the lives of the masses, and be able to have a complete mass viewpoint.

To fully use and fully play the role of readers' letters, we must also be good at widely adopting various forms. In recent months, some newspapers such as the Shanghai Labor Daily have adopted forms such as readers' letter abstracts, readers' letter commentary, letter summaries, answering readers' questions, talking about letters, readers' letter anecdotes, readers' reception rooms, readers' voices, ideological cultivation, essays, cartoons, investigation reports, discussions, and echoes of unpublished letters, according to the characteristics of readers' letters and the various needs of the newspaper. After many useful criticisms from the masses are widely used by the newspaper in this way, it not only improves the adoption rate of readers' letters, expands the scope of use of readers' letters, and unites the broad masses of readers around the newspaper; but also, to a large extent, enriches the content of the newspaper and strengthens the mass character and combat effectiveness of the newspaper. For example, after the Shanghai Labor Daily published the letter of the old worker Ruan Xuesheng on December 22, 1953, expressing that the annual bonus system should be abolished, because it caused a great response among the workers, the newspaper, based on the difficult questions raised in many readers' letters, continuously explained the reason why "the annual bonus system is unreasonable" from the perspective of theory and practice in the form of "Answering Readers' Questions" on the 28th and 29th, eliminating the doubts among some workers. For another example, the Shanghai Labor Daily on October 27 and October 28, 1954 also used the form of cartoons when criticizing the shortcomings in the management work of some factory sanatoriums in Shanghai and exposing the fraudulent behavior of the Chunshen Stencil Paper Industry Cooperative. The former, in a cartoon entitled "Sorry, the beds are full," powerfully satirized that many of the patients admitted to some sanatoriums were staff and workers suffering from "pleasure disease," "love disease," and "ideological disease," so that the sanatoriums suffered from "full occupancy." The latter, in a cartoon entitled "The True Face of the Chunshen Stencil Paper Industry Cooperative," sharply exposed how capitalists "hang a sheep's head and sell dog meat" to deceive customers. Although these cartoons are not very well drawn, it is an effective form that cannot be ignored to use them to deepen the propaganda and mobilization power of the letters.

Although the examples listed above show that the editorial department of the Shanghai Labor Daily has done a better job in using these critical letters, this does not mean that they have completely achieved this in handling all critical letters. On the contrary, in the process of handling critical letters, they have also had shortcomings such as improper use, insufficient investigation and research, and failure to fully play the role of letters. In response to these shortcomings, the editorial department of the Shanghai Labor Daily has drafted to start from correcting the staff's understanding and attitude towards critical letters, and strive to gradually achieve regularity and depth in the work of using letters in the future, so that the criticisms from the broad masses are completely transformed into the driving force for the newspaper to widely carry out bottom-up criticism.

Attracting the people to widely launch criticism in newspapers, especially bottom-up criticism, and accelerating the national construction and socialist construction is an important responsibility of every newspaper. Therefore, every newspaper has the responsibility to pay attention to improving its readers' letter work and give full play to the role of readers' critical letters in building socialism.

    充分发挥读者批评性来信的作用
    董谦
    充分发挥读者批评性来信的作用，是广泛吸引人民群众在报纸上展开批评特别是自下而上批评的一个重要前提。自群众来的批评信件愈多，愈有助于报纸吸引群众，开展自下而上的批评，并对群众进行自我教育。但是，报纸又不可能把来信都在报上一一发表。这就要求编辑部各个部门的同志认真研究读者来信，除了选出一些可以单独发表的以外，还应该充分利用批评信件中的材料、线索、观点和问题来撰写各种文章，纠正那种把批评信件
  “推出去了事”的作法。上海劳动报的实践表明，只要善于想各种办法来运用批评信件，就能比较充分地发挥这些来信的作用，就能有效地展开自下而上的批评。
    要充分发挥读者批评性来信的作用，就要善于从个别问题中去发现普遍问题。这就要求处理来信的同志，对来信中所提出的问题，能够根据实际情况和党的政策方针，进行反复的研究和必要的调查，以彻底弄清它同国家当前各项工作的关系，同广大群众生活的关系。只要能够真正辨别清楚这些关系，那就不难判断读者提出的批评，是个别问题还是普遍问题。例如，上海劳动报编辑部，在一九五三年一月处理批评国营棉纺织一厂无故解雇临时工高佩芬的来信时，他们不仅根据上海市雇用临时工暂行办法和雇用职工暂行办法研究的结果，发现这种作法违反劳动法令；而且根据对国营棉纺织十一、十九厂的调查研究结果，发现这种不经劳动部门自行雇用或任意解雇临时工的现象，还是相当普遍的。报纸发现这是普遍性的问题后，就在一九五三年四月二十二日发表了一篇“来信综述”，指出“部分国营棉纺织厂雇用临时工情况非常混乱”。这篇“来信综述”发表后的第三天，华东纺织管理局即通报所属各国营棉纺织厂注意检查纠正，并会同当地工会、劳动部门组成专门小组，深入国营棉纺织七、十两厂进行重点检查。这样就使一封“个别问题”的来信发挥了更大的作用。这个例子生动地说明了，只要报纸肯认真根据来信中提出的问题进行调查研究，从“个别问题”的来信中发现带普遍性的问题，并不是不可能的事。但不少处理来信的同志，因为存在着一些不正确的认识，妨碍了他们去作这样的努力。例如，有的同志认为：“关于这一问题，来信数量少，是个别问题，不是普遍性问题，不值得发表。”来信数量多少虽是衡量是否普遍性问题的一个标志，但不是唯一的标志。因为，在报纸群众工作基础薄弱的情况下，读者很难把一切工作和生活中所发生的普遍性问题，都在一个时间内反映给报社。同时，有很多问题，在开始萌芽时，虽还是仅仅表现在个别问题上，没有普遍发展起来，广大群众也许还不大看得出来，然而它们却发生着、发展着、表现着一种趋向，很值得注意；或者虽是个别性的问题，但关系重大，报纸可通过这一个别问题，对读者进行普遍教育。报纸编辑部就应该善于识别这种趋向，正确估计它的教育意义，不应根据来信数量的多少来形式主义地决定问题和处理问题。当然，从某种意义上说，也的确有一些批评信件，同国家工作、党的政策、广大群众生活没有多少关系，或者只需个别解决，不需公开发表。这就要求处理来信的同志，能够从实际从政策出发，对具体问题进行具体分析。
    要充分发挥读者批评性来信的作用，就要善于透过现象揭示事物的本质，并经过提炼，提高到应有的政策水平。发现普遍性问题，仅仅是提出问题。至于这个问题的性质是什么，那就需要透过现象从本质上加以分析研究，提炼概括，根据党的路线和政策加以处理。例如，上海劳动报编辑部在一九五三年十二月接到不少读者来信批评工人群众中流行的“标会”现象后，虽然发现这是一个普遍性问题，但“标会”究竟是怎么回事？有些工人群众为什么要参加“标会”？“标会”的活动是否违背政策？读者在来信中都没有交代得很清楚。尽管如此，上海劳动报编辑部并没有因此而就不去想办法运用这些来信。上海劳动报编辑部派人深入新沪钢铁厂、中国纺织机器厂、上海卷烟厂第四厂、新中动力机厂等厂进行了调查研究，弄清了“标会”是以放高利贷的方式来从事剥削的性质；弄清了一部分工人群众参加“标会”的原因，是受了资产阶级思想侵蚀的结果。报纸在一九五四年一月三十、三十一日以“谈来信”的形式，阐明“标会是怎么一回事？怎样正确地解决标会问题”时，并根据自我教育的原则，要求工人群众划清思想界限，提高社会主义觉悟，以互助储金的办法来解决参加“标会”问题。经过报纸这样补充、提炼，肯定了问题的性质，提高到应有的政策水平后，这些原来没有从本质上说明问题的来信，不仅能够为报纸所利用，并且发挥了更大的作用。在上海劳动报一九五四年五月三十一日发表的两封来信中，就曾反映了它在实际工作中所达致的成效：在中国纺织机器厂和某造船厂的工人群众中，已经用互助储金会代替了“标会”。
    要充分发挥读者批评性来信的作用，就要善于使批评性的来信尽量结合中心工作，但也不能只是限于中心工作。在批评的重点上，毫无疑问，报纸编辑部应十分注意结合中心工作，并尽量选择这方面的来信发表，以便把群众的注意力引导到国家工作和群众生活的中心方面。上海劳动报在总路线提出后，因为运用读者来信，比较集中地揭露了私营中、小厂生产上的盲目性，经营管理上的腐败，特别是产品质量低劣和劳动条件低劣的现象，所以把职工群众的注意力，就更多地吸引到对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造这一中心工作方面。但在国家工作和群众生活中，中心工作并不是唯一的。除中心工作外，还有围绕着中心工作的一系列的工作，还有其他各项工作。这许许多多的工作，就构成了国家工作和群众生活的丰富多样性，就构成了读者来信所反映的问题的丰富多样性。既有以中心工作为主的批评，也有对国家工作和群众生活各方面的批评。因而，如果只片面强调结合中心工作，而忽视了围绕中心工作，对国家各项工作以及对群众生活中重大问题的批评，那也会限制群众的积极性，影响报纸同群众的广泛联系，甚至会因为失去群众对各项工作的监督和批评，而影响到中心工作的顺利发展。例如，上海劳动报有一个时期就曾接到一些读者来信，批评有些工人宿舍秩序不好，影响睡眠，有些基本建设工人擅自离开工作岗位，有些资本家虐待工人。从现象上看，这些问题都似乎不是什么中心工作。所以，报纸就没有及时发表这些批评信件。但后经检查，发现这些都是紧紧围绕着当前生产的问题。工人睡眠不足，就要影响出勤，妨碍生产；基本建设工人擅自离开工作岗位，就要影响到国家建设；资本家虐待工人，不只会影响工人生产的积极性，而且影响到对资产阶级的改造。这就充分地说明了，报纸要充分发挥批评信件的作用，就必须善于使中心工作的批评同一般工作的批评有机地结合起来。至于怎样才能更好地结合，依据上海劳动报的经验，那就是处理来信的同志，要能够辨别清楚中心工作同其他各项工作的内在联系，要能够认识读者来信广泛反映群众生活这一特点，并能具有完整的群众观点。
    要充分运用并充分发挥读者来信的作用，还要善于广泛地采用各种各样的形式。近数月来，有些报纸如上海劳动报，就曾根据读者来信的特点和报纸多方面的需要，采用了读者来信摘要、读者来信述评、来信综述、答读者问、谈来信、来信杂谈、读者接待室、读者的呼声、思想修养、小品、漫画、调查报告、讨论会、没有发表的来信的回音等形式。来自群众的许多有益的批评，经过报纸这样广泛地利用后，不仅提高了读者来信采用率，扩大了读者来信运用的范围，团结了广大读者在报纸的周围；并且在很大程度上丰富了报纸的内容，加强了报纸的群众性和战斗性。例如，一九五三年十二月二十二日上海劳动报发表了老工人阮学生表示应该取消年奖制度的来信后，因为在工人群众中引起很大的反响，报纸就曾根据很多读者来信中提出的疑难问题，在二十八、二十九日连续以“答读者问”的形式，从理论和实际情况出发，阐述了“年奖制度为啥不合理”的道理，消除了部分工人群众中的怀疑。再如，一九五四年十月二十七日、十月二十八日的上海劳动报，在批评上海市一些工厂疗养所管理工作上的缺点，和揭露春申打字蜡纸工业社的欺骗行为时，还运用了漫画的形式。前者在题为“对不起，床位已经住满了”的漫画中，有力地讽刺了一些疗养所收容的病患者，有不少是患有“享乐病”、“恋爱病”、“思想病”的职工，以致疗养所发生“客满”之患。后者在题为“春申打字蜡纸工业社的真面目”的漫画中，则尖锐地揭露了资本家怎样“挂着羊头卖狗肉”，欺骗顾客的行为。这些漫画虽然还不是画得很好的，但运用它来加深来信的宣传鼓动力量，却是不能忽视的一种有效形式。
    上边列举的例子，虽然表明了上海劳动报编辑部在运用这些批评信件方面作得较好，但这并不是意味着他们对所有批评信件的处理，都已经完全作到这样。相反地，他们在处理批评信件过程中，也有过运用不当，调查研究不深入，来信作用没充分发挥等等缺点。针对这些缺点，上海劳动报编辑部已拟定从端正工作人员对待批评信件的认识和态度入手，争取今后在运用来信工作中逐步作到经常和深入，使来自广大群众的批评完全变成报纸广泛开展自下而上批评的动力。
    吸引人民群众在报纸上广泛展开批评特别是自下而上的批评，加速国家建设事业和社会主义建设事业，这是每个报纸负有的重要职责。所以，每个报纸也都有责任注意改进自己的读者来信工作，并充分发挥读者批评性来信在建设社会主义事业中的作用。
