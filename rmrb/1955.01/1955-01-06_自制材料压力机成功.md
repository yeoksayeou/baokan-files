    Successful Self-Made Material Testing Machine
    To welcome the New Year of 1955 and support the struggle to liberate Taiwan, employees of the Hydraulic Engineering Machinery Repair Plant of the Ministry of Water Resources Engineering Bureau successfully trial-produced a 200-ton pendulum automatic material testing machine on December 30th of last year. This machine is specifically for measuring the compressive strength of concrete and the bending force of steel, which previously relied entirely on imports. Tests have proven that the quality of the self-made testing machine is good, with a positive and negative deviation of less than 1.5 percent. At the same time, the oil cylinder does not get hot after working for four hours.
    This machine was designed by engineer Huang Xiang, who came from a worker background, and he and the workers jointly researched and produced it successfully. During the design and trial production process, he visited the material testing machine at the Soviet exhibition twice and gained great inspiration. (Our reporter) (Attached picture)

    自制材料压力机成功
    水利部工程总局水工机械修配厂员工为迎接一九五五年元旦和支援解放台湾的斗争，在去年十二月三十日试制成功了二百吨摆拖式自动材料压力机。这个机器是专门衡量混凝土的抗压力和钢材的弯力的，过去完全依靠进口。自制的压力机经试验证明质量良好，它的正副差还不到百分之一点五，同时工作四小时油缸不热。
    这个机器是由工人出身的工程师黄祥设计并由他和工人们共同研究制作成功的。在设计和试制过程中，他曾两次参观苏联展览会内的材料压力机，得到了很大的启示。　（本报记者）（附图片）
