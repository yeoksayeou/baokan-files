A letter from Zhang Hua, a reader from Dongzhushikou, Qianmenwai, Beijing: After reading Li Rui's article "Humanity is Accusing" criticizing Hu Feng, published in the "People's Daily" on January 5th, I strongly agree. This Italian progressive film is indeed a good work. It truthfully reflects an aspect of current Italian society and has a strong artistic appeal. However, as Comrade Li Rui said, we cannot say it has no shortcomings. We cannot see the direction of the characters' struggle in the film, nor can we see the connection between Ricci's personal struggle and the organized struggle of the Italian working class.

After this film was shown in various parts of our country, many newspapers and periodicals across the country published reviews praising the film's achievements, which is certainly appropriate. However, many film reviews are not comprehensive enough, and some reviews even praise the film's shortcomings as advantages. In particular, Hu Feng's "Humanity is Accusing" takes advantage of the film's shortcomings to play his old tune of "life is everywhere" and praising "spontaneity," which violates the principles of socialist realism. I believe it is necessary to criticize this to prevent the general readers from being deceived by Hu Feng's erroneous literary and artistic thoughts.

I have consulted "Translated Collections of Film Art," and in the "International Film News" column of the third issue of 1954, there is a report mentioning that the "Rinascita" monthly magazine, edited by Italian Communist leader Togliatti, published A. Polleri's paper "Italian Cinema on the Road of Realism." In this article, Polleri pointed out that some Italian progressive films have represented, and often very powerfully represented, certain aspects of Italy. Many films attempt to denounce the evils in Italian society, and this sentiment is expressed quite strongly. In this respect, these films are vivid and powerful. However, Polleri also pointed out that some Italian progressive films have not grasped the inherent dialectical relationship of reality, and have not shown the direction of development of postwar Italian reality. Therefore, they have not shown the positive aspects of Italian reality - the struggles of some social groups and classes for a better life. Therefore, the reality shown in Italian progressive films is not complete enough, and one cannot see new things emerging from old things or old things dying.

When specifically discussing the film "Bicycle Thieves," Polleri said that this film depicts the typical situation of an unemployed worker and his family in postwar Italy, and the opening scenes describe this situation vividly. However, after the protagonist loses his bicycle, the story simply focuses on the accidental event of the bicycle theft. Polleri believes that there is a preference for superficial and unimportant accidental phenomena in the film, and in many places, one cannot see the connection between various events and typical things in reality.

In the tenth issue of "Translated Collections of Film Art" in 1954, the "Soviet Art Newspaper" published Danilov's "Review of De Sica's Film 'Bicycle Thieves'," in which the author, while praising the film's achievements, also talked about its shortcomings: "Many things are not expressed in the film, such as the organized proletariat masses, and the Communist Party of Italy. Antonio is lonely, tormented by his own pain, and when he is in trouble, the only one who protects and supports him is a weak child; therefore, Antonio's character is not a representative image of the current Italian working class. Neither Sheelba's police machine guns nor the muzzles of American warships can eliminate and deny the strength of the organized Italian people, who, under the leadership of their vanguard - the Communist Party, have learned how to defend their interests and fight for peace..." "In De Sica's film, one cannot feel the power of proletarian solidarity. This is precisely the weakness of the film."

The reason why I quoted the main points of Italian Polleri's article and excerpted Soviet Danilov's article is because I want to use their correct comments to illustrate that "Bicycle Thieves" has shortcomings. When our film reviews praise the film's achievements, they should not praise the film's obvious shortcomings as advantages, and even more so should not, like Hu Feng, use this to promote erroneous literary and artistic thoughts.

### 对“偷自行车的人”的影评的意见

    对“偷自行车的人”的影评的意见
    北京前门外东珠市口读者张华来信：读了“人民日报”一月五日发表的李蕤批评胡风的
  “人道在控诉”一文的文章，我很同意。这部意大利的进步影片的确是个好作品。它真实地反映了当前意大利社会的一个方面，有很强烈的艺术感人力量。但正如李蕤同志所说，我们不能说它没有缺点。我们在影片中看不见人物的斗争方向，看不见里西个人的挣扎和意大利工人阶级有组织的斗争的联系。
    这部影片在我国各地放映后，全国许多报刊都发表了评介文章，赞扬这部影片的成就，这当然是应该的。但有不少影评是不够全面的，有些影评竟把影片的缺点当作优点来颂扬，尤其胡风的“人道在控诉”一文，竟借这部影片的不足之处，弹起他那“随处是生活”和赞扬“自发性”的老调，违反了社会主义现实主义的原则，我认为必须进行批评，使一般读者不被胡风的错误文艺思想所蒙蔽。
    我翻阅了“电影艺术译丛”，在一九五四年第三号的“国际电影新闻”栏内有一则报道，谈到意大利共产党领袖陶里亚蒂主编的“再生”月刊上曾发表了A·波莱里的论文“在现实主义道路上的意大利电影”。在这篇文章里，波莱里指出：意大利的一些进步电影表现了、而且时常是十分有力地表现了意大利的某些方面。许多影片都企图痛斥意大利社会中的罪恶，并且这种情绪表现得相当强烈。就这方面来说，这些影片是生动有力的。但波莱里也同时指出，一些意大利进步影片还没有抓住现实的内在的辩证关系，没有表现出战后意大利现实的发展方向。因此也就没有表现出意大利现实的积极方面——一些社会团体和阶层为了争取美好生活而进行的斗争。因此，意大利进步影片中所表现的现实是不够完整的，从中看不见新事物正在从旧事物中产生或者旧事物正在死亡。
    波莱里在具体谈到“偷自行车的人”影片时说，这部影片描写了战后意大利一个失业工人和他的家庭的典型情况，开始的几个场面把这种情况描写得很生动，但在主角丢失了自行车后，故事就单纯地集中在丢车这个偶然事件上。波莱里认为，影片中存在着对生活中表面的，不重要的偶然现象的偏爱，很多地方看不出各种事件与现实中典型事物之间的联系。
    在“电影艺术译丛”一九五四年第十号上，刊登的“苏联艺术报”发表的达尼洛夫的“评得·西卡的影片‘偷自行车的人’”一文中，作者在称赞了这部影片的成就的同时，也谈到了它的缺点：“有许多东西在影片里没有表达出来，没有表现有组织的无产阶级大众，没有表现意大利的共产党。安东尼奥是孤独的，被自己的痛苦折磨得十分沮丧，当他处境困难的时候来卫护和支持他的只有一个弱小的孩子；所以安东尼奥这个人物对现今意大利工人阶级说来并不是具有代表性的形象。不论是谢尔巴的警察的机关枪，还是美国军舰的炮口，都不可能消灭和否认有组织的意大利人民的力量，他们在自己的先锋队——共产党的领导下已经懂得怎样保卫自己的利益并为和平而斗争……”“在得·西卡的影片里，感觉不到无产阶级团结的力量。这正是影片的弱点。”
    我所以转述意大利波莱里的文章大意，和摘引苏联达尼洛夫的文章，是因为我想借他们的正确评论，说明“偷自行车的人”是存在着缺点的，我们的影评在赞扬这部影片的成就时，不应该把影片显然存在的缺点，也拿来当优点赞赏，更不应该像胡风那样，借此宣传错误的文艺思想。
