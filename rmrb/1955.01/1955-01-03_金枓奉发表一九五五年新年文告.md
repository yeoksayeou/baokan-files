Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 2nd—According to the Korean Central News Agency: Kim Tu-bong, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, delivered a New Year's address on January 1, 1955.

    The address described the achievements made in 1954 in industry, rural economy, the restoration and construction of cities and villages, and the improvement of people's lives. The address stated: In 1954, more than 120 enterprises were restored, expanded, or newly built and put into production; by the end of 1954, the total output value of national industry not only approached the pre-war level, but also exceeded the pre-war level in many respects. These achievements demonstrate the inexhaustible creativity of the Korean people and the powerful strength of the people's democratic system.

    The address then described the tragic situation of the South Korean economy and people, forming a stark contrast with the northern part of the Republic.

    The address also stated: The peaceful reunification of the motherland is the greatest wish and most sacred combat task of the 30 million Korean people.

    The address said: In order to achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland, the revolutionary and democratic base in the northern part of the Republic must be further consolidated and developed; at the same time, the post-war three-year plan for the restoration and development of the national economy must also be completed more victoriously.

    The address pointed out: 1955 is a decisive year for the three-year plan. The main task facing the Korean people in the new year is to complete and overfulfill the 1955 national economic plan ahead of schedule. The address also called on the Korean people to consolidate and develop their international friendship and solidarity with the people of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries in all aspects.

    The address finally called on the South Korean people to carry out a more resolute struggle against the United States and for national salvation, to strive for the peaceful reunification and independence of the motherland, and to oppose the enemy's policy of trying to turn Korea into a colony and enslave it, and the policy of dividing Korea.
