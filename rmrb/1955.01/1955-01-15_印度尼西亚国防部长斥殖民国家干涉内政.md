Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 14th: Indonesian Defense Minister Iwa Koesoemasoemantri condemned colonial countries for interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs and supporting subversive activities by armed bandits. He told reporters from the Indonesian News Agency on the 12th that the Dutch attempts to infiltrate the Moluccas region were already very clear in December of last year. At that time, some captured rebels admitted that they had come from Dutch submarines. He said that a state of emergency had been declared on some islands between Irian and Ambon, and on Seram Island in the South Moluccas region, because rebels had been found in those places. He said that it is now possible to more effectively step up security measures to prevent unrest.

Prior to this, the commander of the 25th Indonesian Infantry Regiment, Soekowati, told reporters in Makassar that documents that had been intercepted showed that the infiltration activities planned by the South Moluccan Republic rebels were directed by foreign powers. These documents revealed plans for transporting weapons sufficient to equip three battalions to certain parts of the Moluccas.

    印度尼西亚国防部长斥殖民国家干涉内政
    【新华社雅加达十四日电】印度尼西亚国防部长伊华·库素马素曼特里谴责殖民国家干涉印度尼西亚内政，支持武装匪徒的颠覆活动。他在十二日对印度尼西亚新闻社记者说，荷兰渗入摩鹿加地区的企图在去年十二月就已经很明显了。当时，被抓到的一些叛乱分子承认，他们是从荷兰的潜水艇上来的。他说，在伊里安和安汶之间的一些岛屿上以及南摩鹿加地区的斯兰岛上，已经宣布了紧急状态，因为在那些地方发现了有叛乱分子。他说，现在已能够更为有效地加紧采取安全措施来防止动乱。
    在这以前，印度尼西亚第二十五步兵团团长苏可瓦蒂在望加锡对记者们说，从截获到的文件中看得出，南摩鹿加共和国叛乱分子所策划的渗入活动，是受外国指使的。这些文件透露了关于运送足够装备三个营的武器到摩鹿加的某些地方去的计划。
