The so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" signed by U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique aroused great anger among the people of all walks of life throughout the country, and further strengthened the Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan and oppose U.S. aggression. More than 3,000 farmers in the suburbs of Fuzhou City held a meeting on December 24 last year to oppose the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty."
