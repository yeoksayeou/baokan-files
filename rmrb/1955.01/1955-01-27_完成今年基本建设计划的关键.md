    Completing This Year's Basic Construction Plan is Key

    Nineteen fifty-five is a year of decisive significance for China in implementing its first Five-Year Plan. China’s first Five-Year Plan, based on the Party's general line for the transition period and the actual growth of China's financial and construction strength, stipulates huge basic construction tasks and targets for rapidly increasing production levels. To realize this plan, we need to persevere in long-term struggles, and even more, we need to strive to complete and overfulfill the annual plan with intense work in each year, because completing the annual plan is the foundation for completing the Five-Year Plan. Based on the current basic construction tasks and situation, the key to guaranteeing the completion of basic construction in 1955 is to mobilize millions of people to oppose conservative ideas and fully utilize potential capabilities.

    At the beginning of the national construction period, we spent great effort in opposing the tendency of blind advancement, that is, opposing the idea of ​​"large-scale everywhere, large-scale in everything" that did not conform to the overall interests of the country, was unplanned, had no focus, was beyond our capabilities, and relied solely on enthusiasm and subjective wishes. The result of this struggle ensured that China's construction work could basically advance victoriously according to the national plan. In the past two years, we have built many large-scale and modern factories, such as the Anshan Iron and Steel Large Rolling Mill, the Seamless Steel Tube Plant, the Harbin Measuring and Cutting Tool Factory, the Taiyuan Electric Heating Plant, and the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory. We have developed a construction team that is roughly able to meet current needs in terms of quantity and is also improving in work quality day by day. We have also continuously increased our knowledge and experience in planned economic construction.

    Of course, this is not to say that the tendency of blind advancement in basic construction has been completely overcome. In fact, there were still individual projects in the basic construction of 1954 that showed a tendency of blind advancement; in future practical work, we must not only continue to struggle against the phenomenon of blind advancement that only emphasizes tasks and progress, neglects quality, does not calculate costs, blindly recruits workers, and blindly purchases materials, but also oppose the phenomenon of blindly building factories only for the sake of a local area or a part, so that new factories are started here and old factories are reduced or stopped there. But what we want to emphasize here is the issue of how to oppose conservative ideas. Because the basic construction plans of the past two years have not all been completed well. In 1953, only 89.6 percent of the basic construction investment plan was completed, and in 1954 it is estimated that only 92.4 percent can be completed. The construction and installation project plan and the newly added fixed asset plan were completed even worse. One important reason for this is that many comrades involved in basic construction work have conservative ideas. They do not deeply realize that grasping the annual basic construction plan is the key to realizing the construction tasks of the Five-Year Plan. Instead of making every effort to wage a tenacious struggle to realize the annual basic construction plan, they passively treat difficulties. Whenever the annual plan is about to be unfulfilled, they demand to reduce the plan and postpone the progress of some projects; or change the plan, replacing key national construction projects with general projects, and blaming the failure to complete the plan on "the plan being too advanced," advocating "doing what we can," and even when planning for this year just began, some people proposed to "accept the lessons of the previous two years and order this year's plan to be less."

    This view is obviously wrong. Because our annual plan is formulated according to the indicators of the Five-Year Plan, and although some details of the Five-Year Plan have not yet been finalized today, the overall outline has been determined. The Five-Year Plan, based on needs and possibilities, stipulates the progress and speed of the entire national economic development and determines the focus of construction. Therefore, striving to complete and overfulfill the annual plan to ensure the realization of the Five-Year Plan, the main thing is no longer to generally oppose advancement, but to continue to prevent and overcome blind advancement, and focus on opposing conservative ideas in actual work. It should be pointed out that striving to complete each annual plan in the Five-Year Plan is the sacred duty of every citizen. We must never verbally support the Five-Year Plan, but in reality repeatedly reduce its annual plan. Reducing the annual plan also reduces the Five-Year Plan. Therefore, the idea of ​​not actively striving to complete the annual plan must be opposed.

    Conservative ideas in basic construction work are multifaceted, and their manifestations are also different. The most prominent problem at present is that we do not tap the potential of basic construction in all aspects, resulting in projects that could have been done well not being done well, projects that could have been completed not being completed, and plans that could have been avoided from being cut being cut. Taking design work as an example, the former directly affiliated design company of the North China Construction Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering carried out two designs successively, and there were two different results due to the different quality of planning and organization work. One design had a building area of ​​more than 40,000 square meters and took only two and a half months; the other building with more than 10,000 square meters, the design content was simpler than the former, but it took eight months and has not yet been fully completed. From this, it can be seen that as long as the planning and organization work of the design is strengthened, the design efficiency can be greatly improved, rework can be reduced, and more design tasks can be completed. Furthermore, vigorously promoting standard design and advocating the reuse of drawings can liberate a considerable part of the workforce to enrich and strengthen the design work of industrial construction.

    There is also much potential in the work of various construction and installation enterprises. For example, our quarterly progress indicators are very uneven. In this year's plan, some enterprises even only plan to complete 5 percent of the annual workload in the first quarter, and squeeze nearly half of the workload into the third quarter; our working day indicators are also low. Some enterprises only order 180 working days throughout the year. Is it impossible to slightly increase the workload of the third quarter to be completed in the first half of the year? Is it impossible for us to increase more working days so that we can continue construction even on rainy days and in winter? Of course, this is possible. And for every additional working day, taking the state-owned construction enterprises under the Ministry of Construction Engineering as an example, 26.6 billion yuan more construction tasks can be completed. This is an extremely important guarantee for completing the basic construction plan in 1955.

    Construction and installation enterprises also have great potential in organizing factory-based and mechanized construction that has not yet been fully utilized. The affiliated processing plants of many construction and installation enterprises have very chaotic production management and have not given full play to their role; the utilization rate of construction machinery is very low. Among the twelve main types of commonly used machinery currently available in the Ministry of Construction Engineering, about 40 percent or more were not used at all in 1954. In the first half of 1954 in the Northeast region, the average utilization rate of each excavator per shift was only 39.4 percent. Everyone knows that factory-based and mechanized construction is the direction of progress for construction and installation enterprises, which can greatly improve construction speed, ensure project quality, and reduce project costs. Last year, the earthwork project of the casting workshop of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, which required 2,000 workers to work day and night in two shifts for 113 days, was completed in 27 days after adopting mechanized construction. If we organize factory-based and mechanized construction better and apply it to a larger scope, the completion of the basic construction plan in 1955 will be supported by a powerful force.

    There are also many shortcomings in the operation and management of construction and installation enterprises. Even if the drawings arrive and the project starts on schedule, the progress cannot be guaranteed. In 1955, if we can further strengthen plan management and technical management, establish and improve the responsibility system, carefully compile construction organization designs, and improve technical supply work, it will undoubtedly play a significant role in ensuring the comprehensive completion of basic construction tasks.

    According to the requirements of the Five-Year Plan, the scale of basic construction in 1955 is even larger. Completing the basic construction plan in 1955 is indeed an arduous task, and there will be many difficulties; however, the possible conditions for completing the basic construction plan in 1955 do exist. The supply of design drawings in 1955 is likely to improve and has improved compared with the past few years. Most of the design drawings for the civil engineering and construction projects of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant have arrived, and the delivery dates of design drawings for 69 percent of the workload of the Ministry of Construction Engineering have been determined, of which more than 88 percent of the drawings can be delivered in the first half of the year. The technical level and construction experience in 1955 are certainly still insufficient, but after the training of large-scale construction in the past two years, we have improved in this regard and have completed considerable construction tasks. The total amount of basic construction investment completed in 1953 increased by 66 percent compared with 1952, and in 1954 it increased by 18 percent compared with 1953. In 1955, with the foundation of construction in the past two years, as long as we continue to work diligently and continuously improve the shortcomings in our work and fully utilize the potential, it is very possible to complete the basic construction plan.

    Completing the basic construction plan in 1955 is not only the responsibility of basic construction departments such as design units, construction units, and construction units, but also the responsibility of production departments; it is not only the responsibility of basic construction administrative departments, but also the responsibility of Party, League, and labor union organizations. Therefore, all parties must work together and strengthen the connection between departments such as internal geological exploration, design, construction, and technical supply within basic construction to ensure the connection of all links in basic construction; strengthen the cooperation between basic construction departments and transportation departments, especially with production enterprises that undertake equipment ordering, to ensure that equipment ordering is supplied on time; strengthen the political and organizational work of the Party, League, and labor unions to ensure the completion of the basic construction plan.

    In the new year of 1955, let us create more new achievements and new victories. The task of all employees participating in basic construction is to ensure the completion of the progress plan, the completion of the plan for newly added production capacity of major products, the completion of the plan to reduce project costs, and the economic and technical indicators issued by various competent departments, and to effectively ensure project quality and pay attention to construction safety.

    完成今年基本建设计划的关键
    一九五五年是我国执行第一个五年计划具有决定意义的一年。我国的第一个五年计划，根据党在过渡时期的总路线，根据我国财政和建设力量增长的实际情况，规定了巨大的基本建设任务和急速提高生产水平的指标。为了实现这个计划，我们需要以坚韧的毅力进行长期的奋斗，也更需要在每一个年度中都以紧张的工作争取完成和超额完成年度计划，因为完成年度计划，乃是完成五年计划的基础。根据当前基本建设的任务和情况，保证完成一九五五年基本建设的关键，就是必须动员千百万群众，反对保守思想，充分发挥潜在能力。
    在国家进入建设时期之初，我们曾经用了很大力量反对盲目冒进的偏向，也就是反对那种不服从国家整体利益，没有计划的、没有重点的、不量力而行的和单凭热情及主观愿望的“处处大规模、样样大规模”的想法。这个斗争的结果，保证了我国的建设工作基本上能按照国家的计划胜利前进。过去两年来，我们建成了鞍钢大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂、哈尔滨量具刃具厂、太原电热厂、沈阳风动工具厂等许多规模巨大的和近代化的工厂，发展了一支在数量上大体已能适应目前需要、在工作质量上也日有提高的建设队伍，也不断增长了对有计划的经济建设的知识和经验。
    当然，这不是说，在基本建设中盲目冒进的偏向已经完全克服了。事实上，一九五四年的基本建设中也还有个别工程发生盲目冒进的偏向；今后在实际工作中，我们不但要继续向那种只强调任务和进度、不注意质量、不计算成本、盲目招收工人、盲目购买材料等盲目冒进的现象作斗争，而且要反对那种只顾一个地方、一个局部的利益而盲目建厂，以致这里的新厂开工、那里的老厂减工或停工的现象。但是我们在这里要着重指出的是如何反对保守思想的问题。因为近两年来的基本建设计划并不都是完成得很好的。一九五三年只完成了基本建设投资计划的百分之八十九点六，一九五四年预计只能完成百分之九十二点四。其中建筑安装工程计划和新增固定资产计划完成的更差。其中一个重要的原因，就在于很多参加基本建设工作的同志存在着保守思想，他们没有深刻地认识到抓紧年度基本建设计划，是实现五年计划建设任务的关键，不是尽一切努力，为实现年度基本建设计划作顽强的斗争，而是消极地对待困难，每当年度计划眼看完不成的时候，就要求削减计划，推迟若干工程的进度；或变更计划，以一般工程来代替国家建设的重点工程，并且把完不成计划的原因，说是“计划冒进”，主张“量力而行”，甚至在今年刚开始订计划的时候，就有人提出，要“接受前两年的教训，把今年的计划少订一些”。
    这种看法显然是错误的。因为我们的年度计划，是根据五年计划的指标制订的，五年计划的一些细节今天虽然还没有最后确定，但总的轮廓已经确定了。五年计划根据需要和可能，规定了整个国民经济发展的进度和速度，确定了建设的重点，既然如此，力争完成和超额完成年度计划以保证五年计划的实现，主要的就不再是一般地反对冒进，而是在继续防止和克服盲目冒进的前提下，着重反对在实际工作中的保守思想的问题了。应该指出，争取完成五年计划中的每一个年度计划，是每个国民的神圣义务，我们决不能口头上拥护五年计划，而实际上却一再去削减它的年度计划。削减了年度计划，也就削减了五年计划。因此，不积极努力完成年度计划的思想，是必须反对的。
    基本建设工作中的保守思想是多方面的，它的表现形式也各有不同，而当前的最突出的问题，就是不去从各方面发挥基本建设的潜力，结果使得本来可以做好的工程没有做好，本来可以完成计划的工程没有完成，本来可以不用削减的计划也被削减了。以设计工作为例，建筑工程部华北建筑工程局前直属设计公司，先后进行了两项设计，由于计划和组织工作的好坏不同，就有两种不同的结果。其中一项设计的建筑面积共四万多平方公尺，只用了两个半月的时间；另一项一万多平方公尺的建筑，设计内容比前者简单，却拖了八个月的时间，还没有全部完成。由此可见，只要加强设计的计划和组织工作，就可以大大提高设计效率，减少返工，完成更多的设计任务。再如大力推广标准设计，提倡重复利用图纸，更可以解放相当大的一部分力量，来充实和加强工业建设的设计工作。
    各个建筑安装企业的工作中，同样有许多潜在能力。例如我们的分季进度指标是很不均衡的，在今年的计划里，有的企业甚至只准备在第一季度完成全年工作量的百分之五，而把几近半数的工作量挤在第三季度；我们作业日的指标也是偏低的，有的企业全年只订一百八十个作业日。难道说没有可能把第三季度的工作量稍许提一部分到上半年来完成吗？难道说我们不能增加更多的工作日，以至在雨天和冬季也继续施工吗？这当然是可能的。而每增加一个工作日，仅以建筑工程部所属国营建筑企业为例，就可以多完成二百六十六亿元的建筑任务。这对于完成一九五五年的基本建设计划，是一个极其重要的保证。
    建筑安装企业在组织工厂化、机械化的施工中，也有很大的潜在能力还没有发挥。许多建筑安装企业的附属加工厂生产管理非常混乱，没有充分发挥作用；施工机械的使用率很低。建筑工程部现有的比较常用的十二种主要机械中，一九五四年约有百分之四十以上根本没有使用，东北区一九五四年上半年，每台挖土机每班的利用率平均只达百分之三十九点四。大家都知道，工厂化、机械化施工，是建筑安装企业的前进方向，可以大大提高建设速度，保证工程质量和降低工程成本。去年第一汽车制造厂铸工车间，需要两千个工人分日夜两班作业一百一十三天才能完成的土方工程，采用机械化施工后，二十七天就完成了。如果我们把工厂化、机械化施工的工作组织得更好些，应用到更大的范围里去，一九五五年基本建设计划的完成，就增加了一支强大的力量。
    建筑安装企业的经营管理工作也有很多缺点，甚至图纸到达了，工程按期开工了，仍然不能保证进度。一九五五年，如果我们能进一步加强计划管理、技术管理、建立和健全责任制，认真编制施工组织设计，改进技术供应工作，对于保证全面地完成基本建设任务，无疑也将发生重大的作用。
    根据五年计划的要求，一九五五年的基本建设规模更大了。完成一九五五年的基本建设计划，确实是一个艰巨的任务，会有许多困难；但是完成一九五五年基本建设计划的可能条件是存在的。一九五五年设计图纸供应的情况，比起过去几年是可能改善、而且已经有所改善了，第一汽车制造厂土木建筑工程的设计图纸大部分已经到齐了，建筑工程部百分之六十九的工程量，设计图纸交付的日期已经定下来了，其中百分之八十八以上的图纸可以在上半年交付。一九五五年的技术水平和建设经验，固然也还是不足的，可是经过过去两年大规模施工的锻炼，在这方面我们毕竟有所提高，并且完成过相当大的建设任务。一九五三年完成的基本建设投资总额比一九五二年增加了百分之六十六，一九五四年又比一九五三年增加了百分之十八，一九五五年，有了过去两年建设的基础，只要我们兢兢业业地继续努力，不断地改进工作中的缺点，充分发挥潜在能力，是很有可能完成基本建设计划的。
    完成一九五五年的基本建设计划，决不只是设计单位、施工单位和建设单位等基本建设部门的责任，生产部门也负有责任；不仅是基本建设行政部门的责任，党、团和工会的组织也负有责任。因此，必须各方面共同协作，加强基本建设内部地质勘探、设计、施工、技术供应等部门之间的联系，保证基本建设各个环节的衔接；加强基本建设部门与交通运输部门、特别是与承制设备订货的生产企业之间的配合，保证设备订货按时供应；加强党、团、工会的政治工作和组织工作，保证基本建设计划的完成。
    在新的一九五五年中，让我们创造出更多新的成就，新的胜利吧。参加基本建设的全体职工的任务，就是要保证完成进度计划，完成主要产品新增生产能力的计划，完成降低工程成本的计划及各主管部门颁布的经济技术指标，并切实保证工程质量，注意施工安全。
