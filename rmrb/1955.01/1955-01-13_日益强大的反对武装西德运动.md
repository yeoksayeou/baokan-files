The youth of Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Germany jointly express their determination

Youth from Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic are holding a series of gatherings to express their opposition to the remilitarization of Germany.

A delegation of youth representatives from Stalinogród, Poland, has arrived in Ostrava, Czechoslovakia, to participate in a youth demonstration. The conference adopted a declaration to the youth of Strasbourg, France, calling on them to demand that the French Republic's Senate reject the Paris Accords.

Forty-five youth representatives from the German Democratic Republic and West Germany arrived in Karlovy Vary, Czechoslovakia, on the 8th to participate in demonstrations and protest rallies against the Paris Accords held by Czechoslovak youth.

Youth from Poland and Czechoslovakia held a rally in Bielsko-Biała, Poland, on January 9th. The slogan of the meeting was to strive against the remilitarization of West Germany and support the resolutions of the Moscow European countries conference. The conference adopted a resolution expressing support for the Soviet Union's position on establishing a European collective security system, and also stated that for the sake of youth, life, and happiness, they oppose the establishment of a new German "Wehrmacht."

"Struggle Week" Begins in West Germany

The "Struggle Week" against the Paris Accords, initiated by the German Communist Party, began in West Germany on January 10th.

The Ruhr district organization of the German Communist Party held a meeting to discuss the organization of mass rallies against the Paris Accords and the distribution of propaganda materials. The Schleswig-Holstein state committee of the German Communist Party decided to hold "Struggle Days" on January 15th and 16th to explain the dangers of Bonn's war policy to the masses.

Recently, there have been increasing numbers of rallies and demonstrations by people from all walks of life in West Germany protesting the Paris Accords.

A mass rally organized by trade unions was held in Mülheim on the 9th. At the rally, Social Democratic Party member of parliament Eschmann called for a peaceful solution to the German question through negotiations and for preventing the ratification of the Paris Accords.

On the same day, representatives of residents from all walks of life in Munich held a demonstration to protest the establishment of a West German army.

Broad Sections of the French Public Participate in the Struggle

The "Pravda" correspondent in Paris, commenting on the current "negotiations with the East" rhetoric spread by the French ruling groups, wrote: The planners of the revival of German militarism have made some summaries of the recent debates in the French National Assembly, and they have to admit: The Paris Accords are in a very dangerous situation.

It can be seen from many sorrowful confessions from Washington, London, and Bonn that the struggle against the Paris Accords in France has not weakened after the National Assembly debate, but has strengthened. More and more wavering members of society are joining the ranks of those who openly and firmly oppose the Paris Accords. These members of society did not dare to vote against the Paris Accords not long ago. A member of the National Assembly, Le Pen, was one of the 350 bourgeois members of parliament who voted for the government's confidence in the London Accords last October, and on January 7th, he publicly explained the attitude of him and many of his colleagues at that time in the French "Le Monde": "The main hope at that time was that these agreements would become unnecessary, because sincere and thorough negotiations with the East would make these agreements meaningless." However, this hope was dashed, and Le Pen and his partners have come to believe that Mendès-France's so-called "parallel negotiations with the East" rhetoric is only intended to mislead the over-credulous. Therefore, Le Pen, like many other members of parliament, has changed his opinion and believes that it is his responsibility not to support the Paris Accords.

British People Actively Preparing to Participate in "Visit Parliament Day" Activities

"Pravda" published an article by its London correspondent, Olyehov, on the 10th. The article pointed out that the struggle against arming West Germany is intensifying in Britain.

In just the past two weeks, rallies protesting the arming of West Germany have been held in London, Birmingham, Glasgow, Coventry, Sheffield, Clacton, Dundee, Wolverhampton, Hull, and dozens of other cities in Britain. Many rallies have also elected representatives to visit members of parliament. Many rallies have called for a Labor Party conference to re-examine the Labor Party's policy on the German question.

The British people's struggle against the arming of West Germany is entering a new stage, and this struggle is becoming more and more effective. Now, calls for united action are being heard more and more frequently.

Olyehov pointed out: William Wainwright, secretary of the British Peace Committee and member of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, recently published an article in the "Daily Worker" saying that many trade unions, Labor Party organizations, and other social groups have decided to participate in the "Visit Parliament Day" to be held on January 25th. The British people, together with the people of other countries, are determined to stop the threat of the revival of German militarism and defend European peace.

Danish Communist Party Central Committee Calls for Referendum

The Central Committee of the Danish Communist Party held a plenary meeting from January 8th to 9th. The meeting heard a report on the international situation by party chairman Aksel Larsen, adopted a letter to the people calling on the Danish people to demand a national referendum on the ratification of the Paris Accords, and adopted several decisions on organizational issues. The meeting decided to hold the party's 18th Congress in October 1955.

Belgian People Launch Signature Campaign

The Belgian people are intensifying their struggle against the revival of German militarism.

Workers at the metal structure factory in Huy, Liège province, unanimously expressed their opposition to the Paris Accords and signed the appeal of the Committee for Striving for a Peaceful Solution to the German Question. These appeals will be given to the members of parliament of Liège province. Members of the "Belgian People's Youth Organization" are collecting signatures for resolutions protesting the Paris Accords.

Workers at the "Ougrée-Marihaye" steel factory wrote letters to members of parliament opposing the arming of West Germany. The letter stated: We oppose the arming of Germany and support a peaceful solution to the German question. We request that the parliament postpone the discussion and vote on the Paris Accords and make a decision to hold a national referendum.

Canadian Peace Congress Delegate Meeting Protests Arming of West Germany

James Endicott, Chairman of the Canadian Peace Congress and winner of the Stalin International Peace Prize, called on the Canadian government at the Canadian Peace Congress Delegate Meeting on the 10th to hold a referendum on the issue of West German rearmament.

A delegation from the Canadian Peace Congress, led by James Endicott, demanded on the 10th that Parliament reject the rearmament of West Germany. A document distributed by the delegation among members of Parliament stated that a rearmed West Germany entering the North Atlantic Treaty Organization "will lead to a disastrous arms race."

    日益强大的反对武装西德运动
    波、捷、德三国青年联合表示决心
    波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和德意志民主共和国的青年正在一起举行一系列的集会，表示反对德国重新军国主义化。
    波兰斯大林诺格罗的青年代表团已经到了捷克斯洛伐克的俄斯特拉发，参加了在那里举行的青年示威大会。大会通过了给法国斯特拉斯堡青年的宣言，号召他们要求法国共和国参议院拒绝巴黎协定。
    德意志民主共和国和西德的四十五名青年代表八日到达了捷克斯洛伐克的卡罗维发利，他们要在那里参加捷克斯洛伐克青年举行的反对巴黎协定的示威和抗议集会。
    波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的青年一月九日在波兰的比尔斯科—布加拉城举行了集会。会上的口号是努力奋斗反对西德重新军国主义化，拥护莫斯科欧洲国家会议的决议。大会通过决议，表示拥护苏联在建立欧洲集体安全体系问题上采取的立场，决议并且表示为了青春、生活和幸福，反对建立新的德国“国防军”。
    西德的“斗争周”开始了
    德国共产党发起的反对巴黎协定的“斗争周”已经从一月十日起在西德开始了。
    德国共产党鲁尔区组织开会讨论了组织反对巴黎协定的群众大会和印发宣传品的问题。德国共产党石勒苏益格—荷尔斯泰因州州委员会决定在一月十五日和十六日举行“斗争日”，向群众解释波恩战争政策的危险。
    最近以来，西德各阶层人民抗议巴黎协定的集会和示威越来越多了。
    米尔海姆九日举行了一个由工会组织的群众大会，会上，社会民主党议员埃施曼要求通过和平谈判解决德国问题、阻止批准巴黎协定。
    同日，慕尼黑各阶层居民的代表举行了一次示威游行，抗议建立西德军队。
    法国广泛阶层人士参加了斗争
    “真理报”驻巴黎记者评论目前法国统治集团散布的所谓“同东方谈判”的论调时写道：复活德国军国主义的策划者在这些日子里对于最近法国国民议会的辩论作了一些总结，他们不得不承认：巴黎协定处于非常危险的状况下。
    从华盛顿、伦敦和波恩的许多悲痛的供认中可以看出：法国反对巴黎协定的斗争在国民议会辩论以后不仅没有削弱，反而加强了，动摇不定的社会人士越来越多地参加到公开坚决反对巴黎协定的人的行列中，这些社会人士在不久以前还不敢投票反对巴黎协定。国民议会的一个议员勒庞是去年十月就伦敦协定投信任政府票的三百五十名资产阶级议员中的一个，而一月七日他在法国“世界报”上公开解释了那个时候他和他的许多同僚的态度：“当时主要希望的是，这些协定将成为没有必要的，因为和东方举行真诚周到的谈判将使这些协定成为无意义的东西。”但是，这一希望破灭了，勒庞和他的伙伴已经相信，孟戴斯—弗朗斯所谓“同东方举行平行谈判”的论调的唯一目的是要迷惑过分轻信的人。所以，勒庞，像其他许多议员一样，改变了自己的意见，并且认为不支持巴黎协定是他的责任。
    英国人民积极准备参加“访问议员日”活动
    “真理报”在十日刊载了驻伦敦记者奥列霍夫的一篇文章。文章指出：英国反对武装西德的斗争日益加强。
    仅仅在最近两周中，伦敦、伯明翰、格拉斯哥、考文垂、设菲尔德、克拉顿、敦提、武尔弗哈姆普吞、赫尔以及英国其他好几十个城市，都举行集会抗议武装西德。在许多集会上还选出了代表去访问议员。许多集会要求召开工党代表会议来重新审查工党对德国问题的政策。
    英国人民反对武装西德的斗争正在进入新的阶段，这个斗争正在愈来愈有效。现在已经愈来愈经常地听到要求一致行动的呼声。
    奥列霍夫指出：英国和平委员会书记、世界和平理事会常务委员会委员威廉·温莱特最近在“工人日报”上发表文章说，许多工会、工党组织及其他社会团体已经决定参加一月二十五日举行的“访问议员日”。英国人民和其他国家的人民一起，决心制止复活德国军国主义的威胁，捍卫欧洲和平。
    丹麦共产党中央号召举行公民投票
    丹麦共产党中央委员会一月八日到九日举行了全体会议。会议听取了党主席阿克塞尔·拉荪关于国际局势的报告，通过了号召丹麦人民要求就批准巴黎协定问题举行全国性公民投票的告人民书，并且通过了若干有关组织问题的决定。会议决定在一九五五年十月举行党的第十八次代表大会。
    比利时人民发动签名运动
    比利时人民加紧了反对复活德国军国主义的斗争。
    列日省羽伊的金属结构工厂的工人一致表示反对巴黎协定，并且在争取和平解决德国问题发起委员会的呼吁书上签了名，这些呼吁书将交给列日省的议员们。“比利时人民青年组织”的会员正在为抗议巴黎协定的决议征集签名。
    “奥格雷马里哈耶”钢铁工厂的工人写信给议员们反对武装西德。信中写道：我们反对武装德国，拥护德国问题的和平解决。我们要求议会推迟关于巴黎协定的讨论和表决，并且作出举行全国公民投票的决定。
    加拿大和平大会代表会议抗议武装西德
    加拿大和平大会主席、斯大林国际和平奖金得奖人文幼章十日在加拿大和平大会代表会议上要求加拿大政府就西德重新武装问题举行公民投票。
    以文幼章为首的加拿大和平大会代表团，十日要求议会拒绝重新武装西德。代表团在议会议员中间散发的一个文件说，重新武装起来的西德进入北大西洋公约组织“将导致灾难性的军备竞赛”。
