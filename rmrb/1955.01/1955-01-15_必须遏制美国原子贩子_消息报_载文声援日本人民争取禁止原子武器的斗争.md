Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th: Ossipov published an article in "Izvestia" entitled "American Atomic Merchants Must Be Restrained," commenting on the Japanese people's struggle for the prohibition of atomic weapons.

Ossipov first talked about the grand meeting to be held by the Japanese people in Tokyo on January 16th to demand the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, saying: A vigorous movement against the threat of atomic war has prepared for this meeting, and this movement is a current characteristic of Japan.

Ossipov said: Japan is the first country to have suffered the destruction of atomic weapons. During the post-war period, the Japanese public has been fighting for the prohibition of atomic weapons. The United States' recent hydrogen bomb test in the Bikini area shocked all the Japanese people. A powerful movement protesting further testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons and demanding the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons is developing on a large scale. According to a statement issued by Taneura Takashi, a member of the Standing Committee of the Japan Peace Supporters' Committee, people from all walks of life in Japan have participated in this movement.

Ossipov pointed out: Because the American military authorities have now begun to formulate specific plans for launching an atomic war, the large-scale movement in Japan, as well as in other countries in Asia, Europe, and the Americas, demanding the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, is of even greater significance.

Ossipov then said that the evil plans of American atomic merchants and their partners are arousing the indignation of all mankind.

In the face of global opposition to atomic war, the American ruling clique is trying its best to deceive world public opinion and evade responsibility for inciting atomic hysteria and preparing to plot the use of nuclear weapons. The United States is attempting to use its propaganda machine and agents in various countries—including Japan—to weaken the people's struggle to demand the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

However, the American ruling clique has never been able to deceive public opinion, and it will never be able to do so in the future.

The people of all countries, including the Japanese people, know perfectly well where the threat of atomic war comes from. But it is not enough to just know this. For the movement to demand the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons to be victorious, it is necessary to actively expose all those who play with nuclear weapons and prepare for atomic war, that is, to expose American atomic merchants and their aggressive activities.

The Japanese people have made a great contribution to the people's struggle to demand the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons. There is every reason to believe that the meeting to be held in Tokyo on January 16th will be a new contribution to this struggle.

Ossipov concluded by saying: The Soviet people warmly support the movement already underway in Japan to demand the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

The people of the world demand that American atomic merchants be restrained and that atomic and hydrogen weapons be prohibited.

    必须遏制美国原子贩子
    “消息报”载文声援日本人民争取禁止原子武器的斗争
    【新华社讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十三日讯：奥西波夫在“消息报”上发表了题为“必须遏制美国原子贩子”的文章，评论日本人民争取禁止原子武器的斗争。
    奥西波夫首先谈到日本人民将于一月十六日在东京举行的要求禁止原子武器和氢武器的大会说：反对原子战争威胁的轰轰烈烈的运动，已经为这个大会作好了准备，这个运动是当前日本的特色。
    奥西波夫说：日本是第一个惨遭原子武器破坏的国家。在战后期间，日本公众一直在为禁止原子武器而奋斗。美国最近一次在比基尼地区进行的氢弹试验震动了全体日本人民。抗议进一步试验原子武器和氢武器并要求禁止原子武器和氢武器的强大运动正在大规模地发展着。据日本拥护和平委员会常务委员会委员种村孝发表的声明，日本各阶层人民都参加了这个运动。
    奥西波夫指出：由于美国军事当局现在已经着手拟订发动原子战争的具体计划，日本以及亚洲、欧洲和美洲的其他国家开展大规模的要求禁止原子武器和氢武器的运动，更加具有重大意义。
    奥西波夫接着说，美国原子贩子和他们的伙伴们的罪恶计划正在引起全人类的愤慨。
    美国统治集团在全世界反对原子战争的情况下，正在竭力欺骗世界舆论，并规避煽动原子歇斯底里和准备策划使用核子武器的战争的责任。美国企图利用它的宣传机器和在各国——包括日本——的代理人来削弱人民要求禁止原子武器和氢武器的斗争。
    然而，美国统治集团始终没有能够欺骗舆论，它以后也绝不会做到这点。
    世界各国人民，包括日本人民在内，完全知道原子战争威胁是从什么地方来的。但是单单知道这点是不够的。要求禁止原子武器和氢武器的运动要取得胜利，就要积极揭露所有玩弄核子武器并准备原子战争的人，这就是说揭露美国原子贩子和他们的侵略活动。
    日本人民对于人民要求禁止原子武器和氢武器的斗争已作出了巨大的贡献。完全有理由相信，将在一月十六日在东京举行的大会将成为对这一斗争的新贡献。
    奥西波夫最后说：苏联人民热切声援已在日本展开的要求禁止原子武器和氢武器的运动。
    世界人民要求遏制美国原子贩子，禁止原子武器和氢武器。
