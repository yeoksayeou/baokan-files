	Warsaw Advances
	— Commemorating the Tenth Anniversary of Warsaw's Liberation
	Chen Youwei

	Warsaw, the world-renowned heroic city, is today celebrating the tenth anniversary of its liberation.

	Ten years ago today, Polish troops, fighting alongside the Soviet army, entered the urban area of Warsaw after crossing the Vistula River. When the Polish soldiers saw the face of Warsaw, every one of them couldn't help but shed tears of excitement and mingled grief. After the bloody battles fought by the Soviet and Polish armies, they finally drove away the fascist bandits, returning Warsaw to the hands of the Polish people. However, this city, painstakingly built by the Polish people over seven hundred years, was completely destroyed by the fascist bandits. Hitler's bandits openly clamored "to wipe Warsaw off the map." They conducted continuous explosions district by district, street by street, house by house, destroying everything in Warsaw: ancient buildings, murals on palace walls, and statues beside the streets, theaters, shops, and schools. They massacred hundreds of thousands of residents here and destroyed more than seventy million cubic meters of buildings. When the flames of war ceased, there was not a single complete house in the vast city of Warsaw, nor a street or bridge that could be traversed.

	After liberation, some journalists from capitalist countries who had visited Warsaw asserted that "Warsaw will not become Warsaw again within a hundred years." At that time, many people doubted whether Poland would still make Warsaw its capital. However, the brave people of Warsaw and the Polish people did not succumb to these immense difficulties. Hitler destroyed everything in Warsaw, but he could not, and could never, destroy the Polish people's fighting spirit and determination to rebuild Warsaw. Comrade Bierut declared to the world: "We must engage in the reconstruction of Warsaw with high speed, efficiency, and energy." From the very first days of Warsaw's liberation, the work of rebuilding Warsaw began. People flocked to Warsaw from all directions, spontaneously clearing rubble and sweeping streets. The number of volunteers increased year by year: January 1945 - 150,000 people; January 1946 - 475,000 people; July 1949 - more than 610,000 people... In the reconstruction of Warsaw, more than 50,000 organizations and units across the country raised donations and provided manpower for the construction of Warsaw. The working class played the most important role in the reconstruction work.

	The Polish people are rebuilding Warsaw at the fastest speed. Every day, large numbers of rubble piles are cleared away, and new houses are laid and completed. The bridges across the Vistula River are being built faster than the last. Before the war, such a project would take five to seven years, but after liberation, Warsaw workers repaired the first bridge in fourteen months, the second in eleven months, and the third in ten months, while the bridge decks of the fourth bridge were installed in seventy-five days. The extraordinary perseverance and speed of the Polish people in rebuilding Warsaw have been praised and admired by the people of Europe and the world.

	With the efforts of the people of Warsaw and the people of Poland, the face of Warsaw has greatly changed today. In these ten years, Warsaw has repaired and built 220,000 houses, laid more than 200 kilometers of road surface than before the war, more than 300 kilometers of water pipes, more than 100 kilometers of sewers, planted 400 to 500 hectares of trees, and added hundreds of schools, theaters, libraries, hospitals, and nurseries. On the former rubble heaps, high-rise buildings have risen one after another, and wide streets and flat squares have stretched out. The Muranów district, which was once turned into a graveyard for the massacre of 600,000 Jews by Hitler's executioners, has now been established with rows of modern residential buildings and has become one of the most beautiful residential areas in Warsaw. The Polish Publishing House Building, the Central Office Building of the Polish United Workers' Party, the seven-story department store, Constitution Square, the Marszałkowska residential area, and the east-west avenue running through the city are all milestones in the reconstruction of Warsaw.

	Today, Warsaw is not only the political and cultural center of Poland but also an industrial center. Many new factories have been established in Warsaw: automobile factories, power plants, machinery factories, precision and optical instrument factories, chemical factories, as well as clothing, pharmaceutical, and leather factories. Poland's first automobile and first tractor were manufactured in factories in the suburbs of Warsaw. Now, Warsaw's industrial output has increased three times compared to before the war, and the number of employees has increased from more than 100,000 in 1945 to more than 470,000.

	The construction of Warsaw reflects the care of the Polish United Workers' Party and the government for the welfare of the working people and the cherishing of the national style in architecture. In the old Warsaw, on the one hand, there was a prosperous area for the exploiting classes to indulge in drinking and pleasure, and on the other hand, there were low, dark, and damp slums. Now every family has spacious, bright, and well-equipped housing sufficient for their needs; before the war, 2,000 people lived in every 1,000 square meters of building area in Warsaw, while now only 500 people live there. Taking into account the needs of residents' daily lives, shops, parks, and nurseries are located throughout the city. In the process of construction, Polish architects, sculptors, painters, and workers also worked together to restore the ancient city of Warsaw and other historical sites that had been completely destroyed by the fascists.

	Today's Warsaw is a vibrant and more beautiful city than before, a city with the magnificent spirit of socialism. But the construction of Warsaw is far from over. Within the city of Warsaw, there are still more than a thousand construction sites under accelerated construction, and people can see dense layers of scaffolding and cranes swinging their long arms everywhere. The golden dome of the "Palace of Culture and Science named after Stalin," the crystallization of Soviet-Polish friendship, has stretched into the sky more than 200 meters above the ground, shining with brilliant light. In July of this year, the first phase of its construction will be completed to welcome the young guests from all over the world who will participate in the World Youth and Students Festival for Peace and Friendship. The Warsaw Concert Hall, which will be expanded and completed soon, will welcome the upcoming Fifth International Chopin Piano Competition with an even more magnificent appearance. Also, new opera houses, museums, shops, schools, factories, and parks will continue to be built. In the next ten years, the remaining traces of destruction in Warsaw will be completely erased, and its area will be three times larger than before.

	The construction of Warsaw not only demonstrates the Polish people's far-sighted vision, heroic spirit of overcoming difficulties, and unyielding will, but also demonstrates the Polish people's love and confidence in the cause of peace. The famous Polish scientist Infeld put it well: "For Poland and for the whole world, Warsaw is a symbol. How was Warsaw rebuilt? Yes, the new walls are built with bricks and cement, but the real material for rebuilding Warsaw is the Polish people's will for peace." The people of Warsaw and the Polish people understand the preciousness of peace most deeply. Today they will never allow historical events to be re-enacted. When Warsaw architects are diligently designing blueprints, bricklayers are carefully plastering every new building, and florists are planting roses and peonies in the park, they are certainly not doing it to allow the new Warsaw to become a target for bombing and destruction again. But if the aggressive forces headed by the American imperialists really want to return weapons to yesterday's fascist executioners and provoke war again, then the hands of the working people who rebuilt their city will be equally accurate and powerful in striking the enemy.

    华沙在前进
    ——纪念华沙解放十周年
    陈有为
    华沙，这个世界闻名的英雄城市，今天在庆祝自己获得解放的十周年。
    十年前的今天，和苏联军队并肩作战的波兰军队，在强渡维斯杜拉河以后进入了华沙市区。当波兰军队看到华沙的面貌的时候，每一个战士都不禁滴下了兴奋和悲愤交织的热泪。经过苏波军队的浴血战斗，他们终于赶跑了法西斯强盗，使华沙重新回到了波兰人民的手里。但这个为波兰人民七百年来辛勤建设起来的城市，却被法西斯强盗整个地破坏了。希特勒匪徒公开叫嚣“要把华沙从地理上抹去”。他们逐区、逐街、逐屋地进行连续爆炸，他们毁灭了华沙的一切：古老的建筑，宫墙上的壁画和街道旁的雕像，剧院、商店和学校。他们在这里总共屠杀了数十万居民，毁坏了七千多万立方公尺的建筑物。当战火停下来的时候，偌大的一个华沙已经没有一幢完整的房屋，没有一条可以通行的街道和桥梁了。
    解放以后，到过华沙的一些资本主义国家记者都断言“百年之内华沙将不再成为华沙”，当时是有不少人怀疑着波兰是否还会定都华沙的。但是，勇敢的华沙人民和波兰人民并没有在这万般困难面前屈服。希特勒毁坏了华沙的一切，但是他却没有也不可能毁掉华沙人民的斗争意志和重建华沙的决心。贝鲁特同志向全世界宣告：“我们一定要以高速度效能和精力来从事华沙的重建工作”。从华沙解放的最初几天起，重建华沙的工作就开始了。人们从四面八方涌到华沙，在这里自动地清除瓦砾，清扫街道。自愿劳动的人数一年比一年多：一九四五年一月——十五万人；一九四六年一月——四十七万五千人；一九四九年七月——六十一万多人……在重建华沙的工作中，全国五万多个团体和单位为建设华沙而募集捐款，提供人力。工人阶级在重建工作中起着最主要的作用。
      波兰人民以最快的速度进行着华沙的重建工作。每一天都有大批的瓦砾堆被清除掉，都有新屋奠基和落成。横跨维斯杜拉河上的几座桥梁修建得一座比一座快。战前这样的工程需要五年到七年的时间，但是在解放以后，华沙工人以十四个月就修复了第一座桥，以十一个月修复了第二座，以十个月修复了第三座，而第四座桥的桥梁则是在七十五天的时间内安装起来的。波兰人民在重建华沙工作中的非凡毅力和速度受到了欧洲和全世界人民的赞扬和钦佩。
      在华沙人民和波兰全国人民的努力下，今天华沙的面貌已经大大地改变了。在这十年内，华沙修复和新建了二十二万所房屋，比战前多铺设了二百多公里的路面，三百多公里的水管，一百多公里的下水道，新栽了四五百公顷的树木，增添了几百所学校、剧院、图书馆、医院和托儿所。在从前的瓦砾堆上，已经矗立起接二连三的高楼大厦，伸展着宽阔的街道和平坦的广场。曾被希特勒刽子手变为屠杀六十万犹太人的坟场的慕兰诺夫区，今天已经建立了成排的现代化住宅，而成为华沙的一个最漂亮的居住区了。波兰语出版社大厦，波兰统一工人党中央办公大楼，七层的百货公司，宪法广场，马沙科夫斯基住宅区，横贯城区的东西大道等，都是重建华沙过程中的里程碑。
    今天的华沙不仅是波兰全国的政治和文化中心，而且也是一个工业中心了。在华沙已经建立了许多新的工厂：汽车工厂，发电厂，机械工厂，精密和光学仪器工厂，化学工厂，以及服装、制药、皮革工厂等。波兰的第一辆汽车和第一辆拖拉机，就是从华沙郊区的工厂中制造出来的。现在，华沙的工业产品比战前增加了三倍，职工人数由一九四五年的十万多人增加到四十七万多人。
    华沙的建设，体现了波兰统一工人党和政府对于劳动人民福利的关怀和对于建筑上的民族风格的珍视。旧时的华沙，一方面是供剥削阶级纵情饮乐的繁华区，另一方面是低矮、阴暗、潮湿的贫民窟。如今每一家都有了宽敞、明亮、设备齐全的足够应用的住房；战前在华沙每一千平方公尺的建筑面积居住两千人，而现在只住五百人。考虑到居民日常生活的需要，市内各处遍设着商店、公园和托儿所。在建设的过程中，波兰的建筑师、雕塑家、画家和工人们，还合力修复了被法西斯破坏得荡然无存的华沙古城和其他名胜古迹。
    今天的华沙，已经是一个生气勃勃的、比从前更加美丽的城市了，是一个有着社会主义的雄伟气魄的城市了。但是华沙的建设还远没有完结。在华沙城内，今天还分布着正在加速进行建筑的一千多个工地，人们到处可以看到密密层层的营造架和摆动长臂的起重机。被称为苏波人民友谊结晶的“斯大林文化科学宫”上的金顶，已经伸入离地二百多公尺的天际，闪耀着灿烂的光辉。今年七月，它的第一阶段的工程就要结束，以迎接来自各国的参加世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节的青年贵宾。立刻就要扩建完成的华沙音乐厅，将以更加富丽堂皇的面貌来迎接即将举行的第五届国际萧邦钢琴比赛大会。还有，新的歌剧院、博物馆、商店、学校、工厂、公园都要继续不断地建立起来。在今后的十年里，华沙残存的破坏痕迹将要被完全抹去，而它的面积将比原来扩大三倍。
    华沙的建设不仅表现了波兰人民远大的目光，克服困难的英雄气概和坚韧不拔的意志，而且也表现了波兰人民对于和平事业的热爱和信心。著名的波兰科学家英费尔德说得好：“对波兰，对全世界，华沙都是一个象征。华沙是怎样重建的呢？不错，新的墙是用砖和水泥建造的，然而重建华沙的真正材料，却是波兰人民的和平意志。”华沙人民和波兰人民是最懂得和平的可贵的。今天他们决不会允许历史事件的再演。当华沙建筑师辛勤设计图样，泥水匠为每一幢新楼精心粉饰，花匠在公园里栽种玫瑰和芍药的时候，他们决不是为了让新的华沙重新成为轰炸和破坏的目标。但是如果以美帝国主义者为首的侵略势力真要把武器重新交给昨天的法西斯刽子手，再度挑起战祸的话，那么重建了自己城市的劳动人民的双手，在打击敌人的时候也将是同样准确而有力的。（附图片）
