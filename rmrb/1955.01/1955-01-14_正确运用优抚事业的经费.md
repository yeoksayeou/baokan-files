Correctly Utilize Funds for Preferential Treatment

Chen Wenzhang

Funds for preferential treatment are primarily used to address the production and living difficulties of families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary servicemen, and to provide essential material support to help them participate in production. Over the past year, many areas have effectively addressed the production and living difficulties of many impoverished families of martyrs and servicemen by concentrating and prioritizing the use of these funds. Incomplete statistics from 21 counties in three special districts, including Tianjin in Hebei Province, show that families of martyrs and servicemen used their subsidies to purchase more than 1,500 head of cattle and donkeys, more than 3,200 sheep, more than 2,300 pigs, more than 4,800 new farm tools, and more than 400,000 jin of seeds. In Xishui County, Hubei Province, out of 392 families of martyrs and servicemen in 16 townships, 365 families have joined mutual aid teams or agricultural production cooperatives because the government used preferential treatment funds to help them solve their production material difficulties.

However, some areas still have many shortcomings in the use of these funds. Recent investigations in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces have revealed the following serious problems:

First, there is a large backlog of funds for preferential treatment. This backlog mainly occurs at the county or district level. The most backlogged funds are those for in-kind subsidies for families of martyrs and servicemen. On the one hand, there is a large backlog of funds; on the other hand, many production and living difficulties of families of martyrs and servicemen are not being resolved, preventing them from participating effectively in production. For example, in Shou County, Anhui Province, because the funds were not distributed in a timely manner, more than 40 families of martyrs and servicemen in the four townships of Binhu, Wangji, Miaotang, and Xinglong experienced severe hardship. These serious situations demonstrate a lack of a high degree of political responsibility towards the families of martyrs and servicemen, and a lack of a high degree of dedication to the revolutionary cause on the part of cadres in these areas.

Second, the funds are not being used properly, and the principle of "concentrated use and prioritized distribution" is not being implemented. In the first half of last year, Shou County, Anhui Province, distributed a total of 300 million yuan in subsidies, benefiting more than 15,700 households. According to investigations in Shuangqiao and Cao'an districts of the county, the coverage of subsidies was around 40 to 50 percent, with some townships reaching over 80 percent. This average distribution resulted in many households receiving very little, which could not solve the real problems of the truly impoverished families of martyrs and servicemen. In terms of distribution methods, some cadres made subjective judgments or acted as substitutes, resulting in subsidies being given to those who should not receive them and not given to those who should. For example, in Haogou Township, Su County, Anhui Province, instead of using the funds to assist more than 20 families of martyrs and servicemen who were experiencing great difficulty, subsidies were given to more than a dozen families who did not need government assistance. In many places, counties blindly allocated funds without considering the situation, prioritizing key areas, or considering the effectiveness. This serious waste of state property has had a very negative political impact on the masses.

Some areas have also experienced embezzlement and misappropriation of funds for preferential treatment. For example, cadres in the 14th district of Lin County, Henan Province, embezzled the backlogged funds after submitting false rosters to the county for reimbursement. In Liu'an County, Anhui Province, funds were actually used to build public toilets, and in one district of Su County, funds were used to build an auditorium.

The above problems are very serious, and they have caused significant losses to the work. The main reasons for these problems, in addition to the lack of regular supervision and inspection by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the civil affairs departments of various provinces, and the failure to establish unified methods for managing and using the funds, leaving local work without guidance, are that the leading cadres of some county and municipal civil affairs departments also lack the necessary attention to this work. Some cadres even regard managing these funds as an extra burden and do not pay attention to it. In addition, there are few cadres at the district and township levels, many tasks, and few working methods, and the county leadership rarely provides specific policy guidance and working methods. Therefore, the above shortcomings and deviations continue to occur.

In order to ensure that funds for preferential treatment truly play a role in helping families of martyrs and servicemen solve their production and living difficulties, all localities must pay attention to correcting the above shortcomings and deviations. It should be understood that it is not easy for the state to allocate large sums of money for production and living subsidies for these families during a period of planned economic construction, which demonstrates the state's boundless concern for them. At the same time, it should also be recognized that without certain funds as material security, it will be difficult to thoroughly solve the production and living difficulties of these families and to truly do a good job in preferential treatment. Therefore, cadres in civil affairs departments in all localities must attach importance to the management and use of these funds so that they truly play their due role. Only by using these funds well can we organize the vast number of families of martyrs and servicemen into the production front, and only by increasing production can we gradually improve their lives, enabling them to gradually achieve self-sufficiency in production and gradually reduce the state's expenditure and the burden on the people in terms of manpower and material resources. This not only conforms to the interests of the families of martyrs and servicemen and the broad masses of the people but also has a significant relationship with encouraging the morale of the troops and further strengthening national defense. In order to effectively use the funds, according to local experience, civil affairs departments must have a clear understanding of the production and living situation of families of martyrs and servicemen. In the past, some areas conducted investigations and studies among these families, registered those who needed subsidies separately, and then planned and resolved them in batches based on the amount of funds available each year. Facts have proved that this approach is very necessary. Second, a sound financial management system should be established. The collection and distribution of funds at the county and district levels should be carried out with strict procedures. Civil affairs sections in counties with a large number of families should assign special personnel to be responsible, establish special account books, and submit quarterly budget and final account statements and detailed written explanations to higher levels to avoid misappropriation and embezzlement. As for the specific distribution of funds at the district and township levels, it is even more necessary to conduct in-depth investigations and adopt methods of democratic appraisal and public announcement to prevent a few cadres from engaging in malpractice and ensure fairness and reasonableness. In addition, civil affairs departments at all levels above the county level should regularly supervise and inspect the use of funds, exchange experiences, and correct deviations in a timely manner.

    正确运用优抚事业的经费
    陈文章
    优抚事业费主要是用来解决革命烈士家属、革命军人家属的生产、生活困难，扶助他们参加生产的一种重要的物质保证。一年来，广大地区由于集中地、有重点地使用了优抚事业费，有效地解决了许多贫苦烈属、军属在生产和生活上的困难。仅据河北省天津等三个专区二十一个县的不完全统计，烈属、军属用领到的补助款共买了牛、驴一千五百多头，羊三千二百多只，猪二千三百多口，新式农具四千八百多件，种籽四十多万斤。湖北省浠水县十六个乡的三百九十二户烈属、军属中，由于政府用优抚事业费帮助他们解决了生产资料的困难，有三百六十五户已经参加了互助组或农业生产合作社。
    但是，也有一些地区在优抚事业费的使用上还有许多缺点。据最近河南、湖北、安徽三省的调查，就发现有下列一些严重问题。
    首先，是优抚事业费的大量积压。积压的现象主要是发生在县或区里。优抚事业费中，积压最多的是烈属、军属实物补助费。一方面大量积压优抚事业费，另一方面烈属、军属生产和生活上的许多困难得不到解决，使他们不能很好地参加生产。如安徽省寿县因为优抚事业费没能及时发放，在滨湖、王集、庙塘、兴隆四个乡中，就有四十多户烈属、军属生活一度十分困难。这些严重情况，说明了这些地区的干部对烈属、军属缺乏高度的政治责任感，对革命事业缺乏高度负责的精神。
    其次，是优抚事业费的使用不当，没有贯彻“集中使用、重点发放”的原则。安徽省寿县去年上半年共发了补助款三亿元，计补助了一万五千七百多户。据该县双桥、曹庵两区的调查，补助面都在百分之四十至五十左右，个别乡达到百分之八十以上。这样平均发放的结果，有许多户都分得很少一点，但却不能解决真正困难的烈属、军属的实际问题。在发放方法上，由于有些干部主观臆断或包办代替，结果造成应发的不发，不应发的发了。例如，安徽省宿县蒿沟乡不用补助款去救济生活十分困难的二十多户烈属、军属，却对十几户不需要政府补助的烈属、军属进行了补助。至于县里不分情况、不择重点、不问效果而盲目拨发优抚事业费的，许多地方也都发生过。这种严重浪费国家财产的现象，在群众中留下了很坏的政治影响。
    有一些地区也发生了贪污和挪用优抚事业费的现象。例如河南省林县十四区的干部把积压的优抚事业费造了假名册送县报销后贪污了。安徽省六安县竟把优抚事业费修了公共厕所，宿县有一个区把优抚事业费修了礼堂。
    以上这些问题是很严重的，它给工作造成了很大的损失。产生这些问题的主要原因，除了内务部和各省的民政部门平时缺乏督促检查，在管理和使用优抚事业费方面没有订出统一的办法，使下面工作无所遵循以外，有些县、市民政部门的领导干部对这项工作也缺乏应有的重视，有的干部甚至把管理优抚事业费当作额外的负担，而不加过问。再加上区、乡干部人少，任务多，工作办法少，县的领导又很少具体地交代方针政策和工作方法，因此，上述缺点和偏向就不断发生。
    为了使优抚事业费真正起到帮助烈属、军属解决生产和生活中的困难的作用，各地必须注意纠正上述缺点和偏向。要知道，国家进行有计划经济建设时期，能够拿出大批钱来用于烈属、军属的生产和生活补助上，是很不容易的，这说明了国家对烈属、军属的无限关怀；同时也应该认识到，如果没有一定的经费作为物质保障，要想彻底解决烈属、军属在生产和生活上的困难，要想真正作好优抚工作，也是很困难的。因此，各地民政部门干部必须重视优抚事业费的管理和使用，使之真正发挥应有的作用。只有很好地使用优抚事业费，才能把广大的烈属、军属组织到生产战线上去，才能通过增加生产来逐渐提高他们的生活，使他们逐渐达到生产自给，逐步减轻国家的开支和人民群众在人力和物力上的负担。这不仅符合烈属、军属和广大人民群众的利益，而且对鼓舞部队士气，进一步增强国防力量，都有着重大的关系。为了有效地使用优抚事业费，根据各地经验，民政部门对于烈属、军属的生产情况和生活情况，必须作到心中有数。过去有的地区在烈属、军属中进行了调查研究，把需要补助的分别登记起来，然后根据每年优抚事业费的多少，有计划地分批逐步加以解决。事实证明，这种作法是很必要的。其次，要健全财务管理制度。县、区对优抚事业费的领发掌管，要履行严格的手续。烈属、军属较多的县的民政科，应该设专人负责，设立专用账簿，按季向上级编送优抚事业费的预决算报表和详细的文字说明，以避免挪用、贪污等现象发生。至于区、乡具体发放优抚事业费时，更需要作深入调查，采取民主评议和张榜公布的办法，以防止少数干部的包办舞弊，保证作到公平合理。此外，县以上各级民政部门要经常督促检查优抚事业费的使用情况，交流经验，以及时纠正偏向。
