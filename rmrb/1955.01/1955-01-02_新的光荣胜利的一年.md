    A New Year of Glorious Victories

    As the Soviet people tear off the last pages of the 1954 calendar, they also look back on the road they have traveled and summarize their work.
    The Soviet working people commemorated the past year with glorious achievements. In this year, the miners of Karaganda—the Soviet Union's third coal base—marched in step with the entire Soviet people.
    1954 brought new achievements to our work section and to me personally in the struggle to expand coal production and increase labor productivity. As the great Lenin said, labor productivity is, in the final analysis, the most important and the most fundamental thing for the victory of a new social system.
    During this year, we achieved an increase of 5,000 tons in the average monthly output of each coal mining combine. This is the highest leap in the growth of machine productivity in recent years. For example, each coal mining combine averaged 6,330 tons of coal per month in 1951, 6,407 tons in 1952, 7,644 tons in 1953, and in the past year, the output jumped to 12,500 tons. This means that the output of each coal mining combine in one year was almost 60,000 tons more than in 1953.
      This unprecedented index is an important event in the lives of all employees. It is like a signpost for us to achieve new work achievements.
    Of course, I was not the only one who achieved such high productivity. Other workers in our work section, such as Comrade Moshnei, Comrade Bekbusinov, and Comrade Avanaasyev, also greatly increased production, and they over-excavated and sent a lot of coal to the surface. As early as November, half of the miners in the mine had completed the annual quota. All the employees of the mine completed the annual plan ahead of schedule and transported more than fifteen extra trains of high-quality fuel.
    Our achievements are the result of using advanced labor organization methods and extensively applying modern technology.
  　Now, all the heavy operations here, from coal mining to loading coal onto trains, have been mechanized. In all the longwall mining faces, coal mining and loading are done by coal mining combines. The work of transporting coal from the longwall mining face is carried out by huge transfer machines.
    A huge job of transforming the mine began in 1954. This further facilitated our working conditions. In the transformation of the mine, special attention was paid to the automation of the coal mining process. Automation, like mechanization, is an important means to increase labor productivity and ensure labor safety. Some automated equipment is now being installed to eliminate all accidents such as electric shock and gas poisoning. Now, the underground work of miners is gradually becoming completely safe.
    How different this is from the working conditions of the miners here when the British leaseholders were here decades ago. Capitalist entrepreneurs recklessly opened coal mines in order to pursue huge profits, and everything was done by hand. They did not care about the labor safety of the miners at all. Even now, in capitalist countries, mining is the most arduous and dangerous labor. Factory owners adopt the American labor system of cruelly exploiting workers with low wages, exhausting all their energy. No wonder they call the mine penal servitude there. Hundreds of thousands of workers die every year due to poor working conditions.
    In our socialist enterprises, on the contrary, everything is for the benefit of the working people. The Soviet workers are cared for paternally by the Communist Party and the state, and they work effectively for the welfare of the motherland.
    All the employees of our mine have spent this year victoriously, and have decided to increase the speed of coal mining even more next year. We want to mine and send 150 to 200 tons more coal to the surface every day than in 1954. My own goal is to increase the average monthly output of the "Donbass No. 1" coal mining combine to 17,000 tons.
    The state has armed us with the latest technology. From the New Year, hundreds of workers will enter technical training classes attached to the mine to study. Some workers will leave their jobs and be paid their original salaries to study at the coal industry trust joint school. There they will learn highly skilled technologies such as coal mining combine drivers, coal mining combine longwall working face fitters, and tunneling machine drivers.
    The lives of miners are improving year by year. Our mine, like all coal enterprises in the country, has adopted a labor remuneration bonus system. I receive at least four to five thousand rubles a month in wages. In addition, we receive national bonuses every year for our long-term labor achievements. For example, in 1954, the employees of our mine received nearly two million rubles in bonuses.
    I have worked in the Karaganda mine for seventeen years. I have personally seen how this frontier area has become unrecognizable. Stone houses built for miners have replaced the former small huts, and many schools, hospitals, shops, cultural palaces and clubs, gardens and parks have been built. Each miners' residential area is connected by asphalt roads, and comfortable buses and taxis run on the roads. Trams have also been built.
    Twenty years have passed from the laying of the foundation of the new mining city to 1954. Now Karaganda has become one of the largest industrial and cultural cities in our country. There are several specialized schools, dozens of technical schools and middle schools here. In the new city, the beautiful miners' cultural palace, of which the Kazakh Republic is proud, was recently built. Thanks to the care of the Communist Party and the Soviet government, the Kazakh Republic—once a backward and closed frontier area of Tsarist Russia—has become a prosperous frontier area with a developed industry and a high level of culture.
    In 1954, a Chinese miner team came to socialist Karaganda to learn about mining operations. This is our great honor. Our workers, engineers and technicians are very happy to teach their knowledge and experience to our Chinese friends. We are happy about China's achievements in economic and cultural construction. We must continue to consolidate the friendship with the great Chinese people, because we know that this friendship is an important guarantee for the victorious struggle for peace.

    新的光荣胜利的一年
    苏联卡拉干达煤矿区斯大林采煤托辣斯  三十一号副井“顿巴斯一号”采煤康拜因司机  社会主义劳动英雄  巴·努尔马干别托夫
    苏联人民在撕掉一九五四年最后几页日历的时候，同时也回顾一下走过的道路，总结自己的工作。
    苏联劳动人民用光荣的事业纪念过去的一年。这一年，卡拉干达——苏联第三个煤矿基地的矿工们，是同苏联全体人民齐步走过的。
    一九五四年给我们工段和我个人在争取扩大采煤量、提高劳动生产率的斗争中带来了新成就。正如伟大的列宁所说的，劳动生产率，归根结底，对于新的社会制度的胜利说来是最重要的、最主要的。
    这一年间，我们达到了把每架采煤康拜因的每月平均产量提高了五千吨的成就。这是近年来机器生产率增长中的最高跃进。例如，每架采煤康拜因在一九五一年平均每月采煤六千三百三十吨，一九五二年——六千四百零七吨，一九五三年——七千六百四十四吨，而在过去一年中，产量一下子就提高到一万二千五百吨。这就是说，一年间每架采煤康拜因的产量几乎比一九五三年要多六万吨。
      这个空前的指数，是全体职工生活中的重要事件。它就像是我们取得新的工作成就的一个路标。
    当然，并不是我一个人达到了这样高的生产率。我们工段其他的工人，如莫什内依同志、别克布西诺夫同志、阿伐纳斯也夫同志同样大大地提高了产量，他们超额挖掘并送到地面上许多煤。还在十一月间，矿井的半数工人就完成了全年的定额。矿井的全体职工提前完成了全年的计划，并超额运走了十五列车以上的上等燃料。
    我们的成就是使用先进的劳动组织法，广泛运用现代化技术的结果。
  　现在，我们这里一切繁重的操作过程，从挖煤起到把煤装上火车止都已机械化了。在所有的长壁采掘面里，凿煤和装煤都用采煤康拜因。把煤从长壁采掘面运出的工作是用巨大的转运机进行的。
    一九五四年开始了改造矿井的巨大工作。这就更加便利了我们的劳动条件。在改造矿井的时候，特别注意到挖煤过程的自动化。自动化同机械化一样，是提高劳动生产率和保证劳动安全的重要手段。现在正在装置一些自动化的设备，以杜绝触电、煤气中毒等一切事故。现在，矿工的地下工作逐渐成为十足安全的了。
    这同几十年前英国承租者在这里时的矿工们的劳动条件是多么不相像啊。资本主义企业主们为了追逐暴利就滥开煤矿，一切都用手来操作，他们一点也不关心矿工们的劳动安全问题。就是现在在资本主义国家中，矿井的劳动也是最沉重和最危险的。工厂主采用美国的用低微工资残酷压榨的劳动制度，使工人耗尽全部精力。难怪那里把矿井叫做苦役。每年有成千上万的工人因恶劣的劳动条件而死亡。
    在我国的社会主义企业中，恰恰相反，一切都是为劳动人民谋福利。苏联工人备受共产党和国家的慈父般的关怀，他们卓著成效地为祖国的福利而劳动。
    我们矿井的全体职工胜利地度过了这一年，并决定来年还要更加提高挖煤速度。我们要把每天挖掘出并送到地面上的煤比一九五四年增多一百五十吨到二百吨。我自己的目标是：把“顿巴斯一号”采煤康拜因的每月平均产量提高到一万七千吨。
    国家用最新式的技术武装了我们。从新年起，几百个工人将进矿井附设的技术训练班学习。一部分工人将脱产原薪到煤业托辣斯联合学校去学习。他们在那里将学到采煤康拜因司机、采煤康拜因长壁工作面钳工、掘进机司机等的高度熟练技术。
    矿工们的生活一年年地在改善。我们的矿井和全国所有的煤业企业一样，采用了劳动报酬奖金制。我每月至少要得到四、五千卢布的工资。此外，我们年年都因积年的劳动成绩而获得国家的奖金。例如，一九五四年，我们矿井的职工就得到将近两百万卢布的奖金。
    我在卡拉干达矿井工作了十七年。我亲眼看到这边疆区怎样变得叫人认不出来了。为矿工们建筑的石砌的住宅代替了从前矮小的茅屋，许多学校、医院、商店、文化宫和俱乐部、花园和公园都建立起来了。各矿工住宅区都有沥青大马路相连，马路上行驶着舒适的公共汽车和出租小汽车，还建造了电车。
    从新的矿工城奠基起到一九五四年已满二十年。现在卡拉干达已是我国巨大的工业和文化城市之一了。这里有好几个专科学校、几十个技术学校和中学。在新城中不久前建筑了哈萨克共和国引为自豪的、美好的矿工文化宫。由于共产党和苏联政府的关怀，哈萨克共和国——曾是沙皇俄国的一个落后闭塞的边疆区——已变成一个工业发达和具有高度文化的繁荣的边疆区了。
    一九五四年，中国矿工小组为了熟悉采矿业务而来到了社会主义的卡拉干达。这是我们莫大的光荣。我们的工人、工程师和技师们非常乐意把自己的知识和经验教给中国朋友们。中国在经济和文化建设中的成就使我们感到欢乐。我们要不断地巩固同伟大的中国人民的友谊，因为我们知道，这种友谊是争取和平的胜利斗争的重要保障。
