    Making Slides About Liberating Taiwan
    Recently, many units in Anhui and Jiangxi provinces have ordered slides related to the liberation of Taiwan from the Fujian Slide Factory. From November to December 29, 1954, this factory has already produced 202 sets of slides titled "We Must Liberate Taiwan" and "Taiwan Compatriots are in Dire Straits," which were supplied to cultural centers in various counties and cities in Jiangxi and Guangdong provinces for screening. They have been warmly welcomed by the people in various places. During the same period, cultural centers in Hangzhou, Jinhua, Huzhou, Haining in Zhejiang Province, and Xuzhou in Jiangsu Province have also sent letters to place orders. Currently, the workers at this factory are working hard to produce the slides under the slogan of ensuring quality.

    制造有关解放台湾的幻灯片
    最近，安徽和江西两省的不少单位向福建省幻灯工厂订制有关解放台湾的幻灯片。从一九五四年十一月到十二月二十九日，这个厂已经制造了“一定要解放台湾”和“台湾同胞处于水深火热之中”幻灯片共二百零二套，供给江西、广东省各县、市文化馆放映。受各地人民热烈欢迎。同一期间，浙江省杭州、金华、湖州、海宁和江苏省徐州等市、县文化馆也纷纷来函订货。目前这个厂的工人们正在保证质量的口号下，紧张地赶制。
