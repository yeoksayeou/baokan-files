    Shanxi Province Rural Party Organizations' Experience in Leading Newspaper Reading Work
    Chai Zhongren
    In the past few years, newspaper reading work in the vast rural areas of Shanxi Province has greatly developed. In 1952, there were 100,000 newspaper reading groups across the province, with more than 1.5 million peasants participating. Especially after the vigorous promotion of the General Line in 1953 and the large-scale development of mutual aid and cooperation organizations in 1954, newspaper reading groups further developed. The activities of newspaper reading groups not only greatly improved the political consciousness of the participating peasants, but also, through the individual and in-depth publicity of these peasants, made more peasants understand the principles, thereby actively participating in mutual aid and cooperation, striving to increase production, and supporting socialist industrialization. Therefore, newspaper reading groups have become a powerful weapon for the Party to lead peasants in realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture.
    According to the experience of newspaper reading work in Shanxi Province, to carry out rural newspaper reading work, it is first necessary to earnestly solve the problem of the peasants' understanding of newspapers and cultivate the peasants' interest in learning from newspapers, because only when the peasants truly realize that learning from newspapers is indeed beneficial to them can they voluntarily and actively participate in newspaper reading groups. To this end, the Party branch should be good at using vivid facts to make peasants understand the benefits of reading newspapers. When Wu Huanzhang, the Party branch secretary of Guocun Village in Shouyang County, started reading newspapers to everyone, not many people listened; those who listened also did not believe that the experiences introduced in the newspapers were correct. So Wu Huanzhang and Dong Bingyu, based on the advanced cultivation experience of Li Shunda in the newspaper, which was focused on multi-cultivation, deep plowing and soil adjustment, carried out experiments on six mu of land. The experimental results proved that Li Shunda's cultivation experience could indeed produce more grain. The original yield of millet per mu was eight dou, but after trying Li Shunda's experience, each mu produced one shi and eight dou. Wu Huanzhang seized this vivid fact and extensively promoted the guiding role of newspapers in production to the peasants. The number of newspapers subscribed to by the village increased from the original one to fifteen.
    The newspaper reading work in rural Shanxi has developed along with the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Many Party branches have paid attention to establishing newspaper reading groups in mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Now many mutual aid teams and agricultural cooperatives' production teams are newspaper reading organizations. This closely integrates newspaper reading groups with mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Newspaper reading work can both serve mutual aid and cooperation and consolidate development. In December 1954, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the province further developed, and the number of copies of the "Shanxi Peasants" newspaper distributed in rural areas suddenly increased by more than 10,000. Taking Ping Shun County, where the mutual aid and cooperation movement is better developed, as an example, in 1951, there were 685 newspaper reading groups in the county, and in 1952, with the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the number of newspaper reading groups increased to 1,502. According to Shanxi's experience, combining newspaper reading work with the mutual aid and cooperation movement has the following advantages: First, newspaper reading work can truly serve mutual aid and cooperation organizations. The work point calculation method of Wang Shulin's mutual aid team in Liangdu Village, Lingshi County, was unreasonable, which affected the consolidation of the team. Later, the team improved its work point calculation method based on the work point calculation experience of Qu Dengbao's mutual aid team introduced in the newspaper, and implemented a work ticket system, and the mutual aid team was consolidated. Second, newspaper reading is easy to form a system and persist. Because mutual aid teams, especially agricultural cooperatives, implement collective labor and can uniformly arrange production and study time. Third, uniting and educating individual farmers through mutual aid and cooperation organizations. For example, many newspaper reading groups in teams and cooperatives in Changzhi area have absorbed individual farmers to participate in newspaper reading groups based on the principle of voluntariness, and helped them improve their ideological awareness through newspaper reading, striving for them to participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Fourth, newspaper fees are easy to solve, so that newspaper reading group subscribers can maintain a stable development and not be interrupted due to financial difficulties. Agricultural cooperatives and better permanent mutual aid teams in Huguan County use public welfare funds to subscribe to newspapers for a quarter at a time. Such subscribers account for 64 percent of the county's total subscribers.
    Under the circumstance of the continuous development of newspaper reading groups, how the Party branch can strengthen the specific leadership of each newspaper reading group is a very important issue. In order to solve this problem, various places in Shanxi have established newspaper reading guidance groups under the branch. The branch uses this organization to understand the activities of each newspaper reading group and solve the problems in newspaper reading work. Experience has proven that the establishment of newspaper reading guidance groups has indeed strengthened the specific leadership of the branch over newspaper reading work, and newspaper reading work has fully played its role. Some wealthy households in Dongshan Village, Wenxi County, often lent wheat and cotton, and carried out usurious exploitation of other peasants. The branch specifically studied this problem with the newspaper reading guidance group, and specifically guided each newspaper reading group to criticize this exploitative ideology through reading and discussion. Finally, based on the experience of establishing credit cooperatives introduced in the newspaper, they mobilized the masses to establish a credit cooperative, which played a great role in restricting usurious exploitation. The newspaper reading guidance group of the Beizhang Village branch in Wuxiang County first circled the articles that must be read after receiving the newspaper, and specifically guided each newspaper reading group to study and discuss, so as to avoid the tendency of newspaper reading groups to choose newspaper reading materials purely from the perspective of the masses' interests.
    The development speed of rural newspaper reading groups in Shanxi Province is very fast, but the lack of newspaper readers has added great difficulties to newspaper reading work. Therefore, actively training newspaper readers and improving their political level and professional ability is another problem that the Party branch must solve in leading newspaper reading groups. When solving this problem, Party branches in various places in Shanxi Province mainly adopted the following three methods: First, regularly organize newspaper readers to study and improve their political awareness and cultural level in a planned way. For example, the Party branch of Beizhang Village, Wuxiang County, stipulates that all newspaper readers should be organized to study once every ten days, and the articles to be read to the peasants should be collectively studied in advance, so that each newspaper reader can understand the basic spirit of the article. This not only strengthened the confidence of the newspaper readers, but also increased the effect of newspaper reading. After more than a year of training by the Party branch, the political level and professional ability of the twelve newspaper readers in Beizhang Village have been significantly improved. When Li Baoyuan first became a newspaper reader, he only knew more than 1,400 characters. After more than a year, he has learned more than 3,200 characters. He said: "If I were not a newspaper reader, I would not study so attentively, and I would not make progress so quickly." Second, select some students with better academic performance in civil schools and winter schools, and train them to be newspaper readers in a planned way. This not only consolidates the students' learning results, but also carries out newspaper reading work. The Xiasile Village branch in Xiyang County trained twelve students in the civil school as newspaper readers in the village. Third, give full play to the role of revolutionary soldiers who have retired and returned to their hometowns and graduates of higher primary schools who are engaged in agricultural production in newspaper reading work. For example, in Yushe County, there are more than 700 revolutionary soldiers who have retired and returned to their hometowns and more than 300 graduates of higher primary schools. Under the leadership of the Party branch, many of them have become newspaper readers and Party propagandists, and have become the backbone and activists in rural newspaper reading work.
    Whether the newspaper reading group is active, whether the peasants are interested in reading newspapers, and whether reading newspapers is really helpful to everyone, are closely related to whether the newspaper reading method is correct and whether newspaper reading discussions can solve problems. According to the existing experience in various parts of Shanxi Province, the following methods are more successful. First, select relevant articles in newspapers and read and explain them while focusing on current production activities and the ideological situation of the masses. The advantage of this method is that it can consciously solve specific problems in the work and avoid the problem of aimlessly reading for a while. Second, turn newspaper reading into newspaper narration and newspaper speaking. The advantage of this method is that newspaper reading has become a speech, which can be done anytime, anywhere, with many or few people. Before each newspaper reading, many newspaper readers carefully study the articles they are going to read, remember the specific facts in the articles, understand the main spirit of the articles, and then combine the specific situation of the village and tell everyone in a spoken way and in popular language. The masses are easy to accept it, which is more effective than reading word by word according to the newspaper. Third, use the method of speaking quick boards to read newspapers, compile important materials from newspapers into quick boards in the language of the masses, and perform them to the masses, which is very attractive. Fourth, in the busy farming season, the method of "reading newspapers in the fields" is also very popular among the masses. Some peasants praised their newspaper reading in the fields: "Newspapers are brought to the fields, problems are discussed during rest, production and learning are combined together."
    How to organize discussions? First, select typical materials with educational significance from the newspaper to organize the masses to discuss, focusing on the various ideological problems of the peasants. Many feudal ideas still exist among the peasants in Baijiagou Village, Xing County. For example, Jia Haier prevented his daughter from making legitimate divorce requests and refused to allow his daughter to return home. The newspaper reading group selected news about marriage issues published in the "Shanxi Peasants" newspaper and organized peasants to discuss it in light of Jia Haier's facts. In the discussion, the evils of buying and selling marriages were compared with the happy life of free marriage, so that everyone realized the benefits of the Marriage Law. Some peasants said: "After such a discussion and comparison, we realized that free marriage is good, and the Marriage Law is correct." Jia Haier also realized his mistake in the discussion and no longer restricted his daughter from freely choosing a partner. Second, lead newspaper reading groups to participate in discussions on various issues initiated in the newspaper. In recent years, the "Shanxi Peasants" newspaper has initiated several major discussions such as "Who should the peasants follow?" and "What road should the peasants take?" Many people from newspaper reading groups in various places participated in these discussions and published their discussion articles. These articles were written specifically and vividly and were very popular among readers. The newspaper reading group in Dongcun Village, Wuxiang County, also established a "Peasant Newspaper Reading Discussion Writing Service" to help illiterate peasants write articles to participate in the discussion in order to participate in the discussion in the newspaper. This has played a great role in improving the socialist consciousness of the peasants.
    In order to encourage the masses' enthusiasm for reading newspapers and improve and consolidate the effectiveness of newspaper reading work, Party branches in various places have held newspaper reading tests and conducted newspaper reading quizzes. The most effective of these is to set up a "Newspaper Reading Question and Answer Column" to conduct regular newspaper reading questions and answers that are related to actual life. The Xisai Village Party Branch in Pingshun County created a "Newspaper Reading Question and Answer Column" in 1953, and mobilized the masses inside and outside the newspaper reading group to ask questions and answer each other in this column, which aroused great interest among the masses. For example, at the beginning of the township division work, people did not understand the meaning and purpose of township division. The branch organized everyone to conduct questions and answers in conjunction with the township division work. Bai Ganglin asked Guo Shuangming in the question and answer column: "Why do we need to divide townships?" Guo Shuangming quickly found the newspaper, carefully studied the articles related to township division, wrote the answer, and posted it in the question and answer column. Bai Ganglin was very satisfied after reading it, and other people also felt that the answer was very clear. In addition to conducting questions and answers in conjunction with the central work, the question and answer column also has current affairs and politics, Party policies, production technology and other questions and answers.
    There are still some problems in the current rural newspaper reading work. The main problem is that the development of newspaper reading groups is not very balanced. According to the statistics of Qingxu, Lishi, Fenyang, Pingyao, Yushe and other five counties in November 1954, agricultural cooperatives that subscribed to the "Shanxi Daily" and "Shanxi Peasants" newspapers accounted for only 55% of all agricultural cooperatives, and mutual aid teams that subscribed to newspapers accounted for only 7.4% of the total number of mutual aid teams. According to the statistics of Yushe County, there are 559 natural villages in the county, of which 202 natural villages do not have a single newspaper. This means that many peasants are not getting the education of newspapers. Secondly, some newspaper reading groups have gradually become disorganized. Newspaper readers do not lead everyone to read newspapers on time, and group members are not interested in reading newspapers because no problems have been solved in reading newspapers, forming a self-flowing state.
    The main reason for this situation is that many county and district Party committees and rural Party grassroots organizations lack attention to newspaper reading work. Therefore, they cannot understand the problems existing in newspaper reading work in a timely manner, and even if they understand them, they do not conduct serious research and solutions. For example, the Propaganda Department of the Fenyang County Committee of the Communist Party of China does not know much about the newspaper distribution situation in the county. Last November, the number of newspaper subscriptions in the county began to decline, but they did not notice it. Although it was discovered later, no effective measures were taken, so the number of newspapers in the county continued to decline in December. Similar situations also exist in some other counties. This needs to be improved in the future. Otherwise, newspaper reading work in these areas will be difficult to carry out.

    山西省农村党组织领导读报工作的经验
    柴钟仁
    几年来，山西省广大农村的读报工作有了很大的发展。一九五二年全省已有十万个读报组，参加读报组的群众达到了一百五十多万人。特别是在一九五三年大张旗鼓宣传总路线和一九五四年互助合作组织大量发展以后，读报组又有进一步的发展。读报组的活动，不仅大大提高了参加读报组的农民的政治觉悟，而且通过这些农民的个别的深入的宣传，使更多的农民懂得了道理，从而积极参加互助合作，努力增加生产，支援社会主义工业化，因此读报组已成为党领导农民实现农业的社会主义改造事业的一种有力武器。
    根据山西省的读报工作的经验，要开展农村读报工作，首先必须认真解决农民群众对报纸的认识问题，培养农民群众学习报纸的兴趣，因为农民群众只有在真正认识到学习报纸对自己确实有好处的时候，才能自愿积极参加读报组。为此，党支部就要善于通过活生生的事实，使农民群众了解读报的好处，山西寿阳县郭村党支部书记吴焕章开始给大家读报时，听的人不多；听的人也不相信报纸介绍的经验是正确的。于是吴焕章就和董炳玉等人，根据报纸上介绍的李顺达多耕深耕和调剂土壤的先进耕作经验，在六亩土地上进行了试验，试验结果证明李顺达的耕作经验确实能多打粮食，原来每亩谷子产量是八斗，试用李顺达的经验以后，每亩就产了一石八斗。吴焕章就抓住这一活生生的事实，向农民群众深入宣传了报纸对生产的指导作用。这个村订阅的报纸就从原来的一份增加到了十五份。
    山西农村的读报工作是随着互助合作运动的发展而发展起来的，许多党支部都注意在互助合作组织中建立读报组。现在有许多互助组和农业社的生产小组就是读报组织。这样就把读报组和互助合作组织紧密结合起来，读报工作既能为互助合作服务，又能巩固地发展。一九五四年十二月，全省互助合作运动有了进一步的发展，“山西农民”报在农村的发行份数一下子就增加了一万多份。以互助合作运动发展较好的平顺县为例，在一九五一年全县有六百八十五个读报组，一九五二年随着互助合作运动的发展，读报组就增加到了一千五百零二个。根据山西的经验，把读报工作和互助合作运动结合起来有以下几个好处：第一、读报工作真正能够为互助合作组织服务，灵石县两渡村王树林互助组的记工办法不合理，影响了组的巩固。后来这个组根据报纸所介绍的屈登宝互助组的记工经验，改进了记工方法，实行了工票制度，互助组就巩固了。第二、读报容易形成一种制度，坚持下去。因为互助组特别是农业社实行集体劳动，能够统一安排生产和学习时间。第三、通过互助合作组织去团结和教育单干农民。像长治地区许多组和社的读报组，都根据自愿的原则，吸收单干农民参加了读报组，通过读报来帮助他们提高思想觉悟，争取他们参加互助合作组织。第四、报费容易解决，使读报组订户经常保持稳固的发展，不至于因报费困难而使报纸中断。像壶关县的农业社和较好的常年互助组，都是用公益金一次订阅一个季度的报纸，这样的订户就占全县总订户的百分之六十四。
    在读报组不断发展的情况下，党支部如何加强对各个读报组的具体领导是一个很重要的问题。为着解决这个问题，山西各地在支部下面设立了读报指导组。支部就通过这个组织，了解各个读报组的活动情形，解决读报工作中的问题。经验证明读报指导组的建立，确实加强了支部对读报工作的具体领导，读报工作充分发挥了作用。闻喜县东山底村有些富裕户，常常贷放麦子和棉花，对其他农民进行高利贷剥削。支部就同读报指导组专门研究了这个问题，并具体指导各个读报组，通过读报和讨论，批判这种剥削思想，最后根据报纸上介绍的建立信用合作社的经验，动员群众建立了一个信用合作社，对于限制高利贷剥削起了很大作用。武乡县北漳村支部的读报指导组，在每次收到报纸以后，都是首先圈定必读的文章，并具体指导各个读报组学习和讨论，这样可以避免读报组单纯从群众兴趣出发选择读报材料的偏向。
    山西省农村读报组发展的速度很快，但是，由于读报员的缺乏，给读报工作增加了很大的困难。因此，积极培养读报员，提高读报员的政治水平和业务能力，这是党支部在领导读报组工作中必须解决的另一个问题。山西省各地党支部在解决这个问题时，主要采取了以下三种办法：一、经常地组织读报员学习，有计划地提高他们的政治觉悟和文化水平。像武乡县北漳村党支部，规定每十天组织全体读报员进行一次学习，把准备向农民读的文章，事先进行集体研究，使每个读报员都能领会文章的基本精神，这样不但加强了读报员的信心，而且也增加了读报的效果。北漳村十二个读报员经过党支部这样一年多的培养，无论政治水平和业务能力都有显著的提高。李保元初当读报员的时候，仅认识一千四百多个字，经过一年多的工夫，已认识到了三千二百多个字。他说：“不当读报员，学习就不会这么专心，进步也不会这么快。”二、在民校和冬学里，挑选一些学习成绩较好的学员，有计划地培养他们做读报员，这样不但可以巩固学员的学习成果，同时也开展了读报工作。昔阳县下思乐村支部就在民校里培养了十二个学员，作为村里的读报员。三、充分发挥退伍回乡的革命军人和参加农业生产的高小毕业生在读报工作中的作用。像榆社县有七百多个退伍回乡的革命军人和三百多个高小毕业生，他们在党支部的领导下，有不少人当了读报员和党的宣传员，成了农村读报工作中的骨干和积极分子。
    读报组是否活跃，农民对读报是否感兴趣，读了报是否对大家真正有帮助，这和读报方法是不是对头，读报讨论能不能解决问题有很大关系。根据山西省各地已有的经验，以下几种方法是比较成功的。一、针对当前的生产活动和群众的思想情况，在报纸上选择有关的文章边读边讲。这个方法的好处是，可以做到有意识地去解决工作中的具体问题，避免那个毫无目的乱读一阵的毛病。二、把读报变成讲报和说报。这个方法的好处是，把读报变成了讲话，随时随地，人多人少都可以。许多读报员在每次读报以前都把准备要读的文章，先认真地学习一遍，记清文章中的具体事实，领会文章中的主要精神，再结合本村的具体情况，用说话的方式，用通俗的语言，讲给大家听，群众容易接受，比照着报纸一字一句地去念，效果大。三、用说快板的方法读报，把报纸上的重要材料，用群众的口语编成快板，向群众表演，吸引力很大。四、在农忙季节，采用“地头读报”的方法，也很受群众欢迎，有些农民这样赞美他们的地头读报：“报纸上了地，休息谈问题，生产和学习，结合在一起。”
    怎样组织讨论？一、针对农民的各种思想问题，从报上选择有教育意义的典型材料，组织群众讨论。兴县白家沟村的农民中，还存在着许多封建思想，比如贾海儿，就阻止他女儿正当的离婚要求，不许他女儿回家。读报组就选择了“山西农民”报发表的关于婚姻问题的新闻，组织农民结合贾海儿的事实，展开了讨论。讨论中，把买卖婚姻的恶果和自由结婚的美满生活作了对照，使大家认识到了婚姻法的好处。有的农民说：“这么一讨论，一对照，咱才知道自由结婚就是好，婚姻法规定的对。”贾海儿在讨论中也认识到自己的错误，再也不限制他女儿自由选择对象了。二、领导读报组参加报纸上发起的对各种问题的讨论。几年来“山西农民”报，曾发起过“农民应当跟谁走”和“农民应当走什么道路”等几次大的讨论，各地读报组有不少人参加了这些讨论，发表了他们的讨论文章，这些文章写得具体生动，很受读者欢迎。武乡县东村读报组，为了参加报纸上的讨论，还成立了“农民读报讨论代笔所”，帮助不识字的农民写参加讨论的文章。这对提高农民的社会主义觉悟起了很大的作用。
    各地党支部，为了鼓励群众的读报情绪，提高和巩固读报工作效果，曾经举行读报测验，进行读报问答等。其中最有效的是设置“读报问答栏”，进行经常的、联系实际生活的读报问答。平顺县西赛村党支部一九五三年创办了一个“读报问答栏”，发动读报组内外的群众在这个栏里互相提问题，互相解答，引起了群众很大兴趣。如在划乡工作开始的时候，人们对划乡的意义和目的闹不清楚，支部就组织大家结合划乡工作展开问答。白岗林在问答栏问郭双明：“为什么要划乡？”郭双明就赶紧找报纸，认真地学习了有关划乡的文章，写成了答案，贴在问答栏里。白岗林看了觉得很满意，其他群众也觉得答的很明白。问答栏除了结合中心工作进行问答外，还有时事政治、党的政策、生产技术等问答。
    目前农村读报工作中还存在着一些问题，主要的是读报组的发展还不很平衡。根据清徐、离山、汾阳、平遥、榆社等五个县在一九五四年十一月份的统计，订“山西日报”和“山西农民”报的农业社，只占所有农业社数的百分之五十五，订报的互助组只占互助组总数百分之七点四。根据榆社县的统计，全县共有五百五十九个自然村，其中有二百零二个自然村还没有一份报纸。这就是说，还有不少的农民群众，得不到报纸对他们的教育。其次，有些读报组逐渐涣散起来，读报员不按时领导大家读报，组员们也因为读报中没有解决了问题，而对读报不感到兴趣，形成自流状态。
    形成这种情况的主要原因是，有不少县区党委和农村党的基层组织，对读报工作缺乏重视，因而对读报工作中存在的问题，不能及时了解，了解了也不去进行认真的研究和解决。如中共汾阳县委宣传部，对全县的报纸发行情况就不大了解，去年十一月全县订阅报纸份数开始下降，他们就没有发现。后来虽然发现了，但又没有采取有效办法，因而到十二月份该县报纸份数仍在继续下降。类似这样的情形，在其他一些县里也同样的存在着。这是需要今后注意改进的。否则这些地区的读报工作就很难开展起来。
