Some of the exhibits from the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition have been transported from Beijing to Shanghai after the exhibition closed in Beijing. They will be displayed in the soon-to-be-completed Shanghai Sino-Soviet Friendship Building. Among the exhibits that have already arrived in Shanghai are tractors and various machines. In order to prepare for the exhibition, Shanghai has established a special office. A machine installation team has also been established and will work under the guidance of Soviet experts. A special agency has also been established at the Shanghai East Station of the Shanghai Railway Administration to be responsible for loading and unloading the exhibits.

    苏联展览会部分展览品运到上海
    苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会在北京闭幕后，已有数批展览品由北京运到上海，准备在即将落成的上海中苏友好大厦展出。已经运到上海的部分展览品中，有拖拉机和各种机器等。为了作好展览会的筹备工作，上海已成立了专门办公机构。一支机器安装大队也已成立，将在苏联专家指导下进行工作。上海铁路管理局上海东站也成立了专门机构，负责装卸展览品。
