Xinhua News Agency, January 4th: The U.S. State Department announced on January 3rd that the foreign ministers of the eight countries participating in the Manila Treaty Organization – the United States, Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Thailand, and the Philippines – will hold a meeting in Bangkok, Thailand on February 23rd to discuss the specifics of implementing the Manila Treaty.

According to reports from Western news agencies, the United States is convening this meeting primarily to strengthen the military power of the Manila Treaty Organization and to intensify aggressive deployments in Southeast Asia. The reports emphasize that the central issue of this meeting is to put "teeth" into the Manila Treaty Organization, making it an effective tool for the United States to carry out aggression in Asia. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles stated at a press conference on December 31st that the U.S. plan is to try to establish a "mobile" force at this meeting and organize a "permanent command." According to a United Press report, the United States will require each country participating in the Manila Treaty to allocate at least a batch of naval and air forces to participate in this mobile force, which will naturally be controlled by the Pentagon, for the United States to dispatch when taking aggressive military action.

Dulles also stated that the meeting will "pay special attention to dealing with" what he called "subversive activities" by national liberation movements in Asian countries. According to a United Press report on the 3rd, Dulles will propose drafting a so-called "cooperative security measure" to "uniformly plan the detection and control" of the actions of communists in Southeast Asia and non-communists "who may help the communists." As U.S. news agencies revealed earlier, the specific approach is to strengthen intelligence and police forces to expand the terroristic suppression of the people of Asian countries. They call this "internal defense."

The report revealed that the meeting will also specifically discuss the situation in Indochina and the issue of strengthening reactionary terrorist rule in South Vietnam. Regarding this, many reports have indicated that the United States will further interfere in the internal affairs of Indochinese countries, especially in Vietnam, under the guise of the so-called "anti-subversion" clauses of the Manila Treaty, in order to undermine the Geneva Conference agreements, undermine Vietnam's general election, and obstruct Vietnam from achieving democratic reunification.

    美国宣布参加马尼拉条约集团的国家将在曼谷开会
    阴谋加紧进行对东南亚地区的侵略部署
    【新华社四日讯】美国国务院在一月三日宣布，参加马尼拉条约集团的美国、英国、法国、澳大利亚、新西兰、巴基斯坦、泰国、菲律宾八国的外交部长将在二月二十三日在泰国的曼谷举行会议，讨论实施马尼拉条约的具体办法的问题。
    根据西方通讯社的报道，美国召开这次会议的目的首先是要加强马尼拉条约集团的军事力量，和加紧对东南亚地区的侵略部署。消息强调：这次会议的中心问题是要给马尼拉条约集团装上“牙齿”，使它成为美国在亚洲进行侵略的有效工具。美国国务卿杜勒斯去年十二月三十一日在记者招待会上就表明过，美国的计划是要在这次会议上设法建立一支“机动”部队，并且组织一个“常设司令部”。据合众社透露，美国将要求参加马尼拉条约各国至少拨出一批海空军参加这支自然将归五角大楼控制的机动部队，以供美国采取侵略军事行动时差遣。
    杜勒斯还表明：这次会议将“特别注意对付”他称之为“颠覆活动”的亚洲各国的民族解放运动。据合众社三日消息透露，杜勒斯将提出拟订一项所谓“合作的安全措施”，来“统一筹划侦查和管制”东南亚地区的共产党人和“可能帮助共产党人的”非共产党人的行动。具体的做法，如美国通讯社早先所透露的，就是要加强特务和警察力量，来扩大对亚洲各国人民的恐怖镇压。他们把这叫做“内部防御”。
    消息透露，这次会议还将特别讨论印度支那局势和在南越加强反动恐怖统治的问题。关于这一点，已有许多报道表明：美国将在马尼拉条约的所谓“反颠覆”条款的幌子下进一步干涉印度支那各国的内政，特别是干涉越南的内政，以破坏日内瓦会议的协议，破坏越南的普选、阻挠越南实现民主的统一。
