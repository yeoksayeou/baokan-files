    Turpan Achieves Large-Scale Cotton Bumper Harvest Last Year
    In 1954, Turpan County, Xinjiang Province, achieved an unprecedented large-scale bumper harvest of cotton. The county's cotton fields totaled 40,589 mu (accounting for 18.88% of the total sown area of crops), with a total output of over 12,782,000 jin, and an average yield of 314.5 jin of seed cotton per mu. In cotton fields using Soviet cotton seeds, one-third of the cotton fields had yields as high as 400 to 929 jin; the cotton crop experiment station's 9.5 mu of Soviet cotton seeds yielded 1,324 jin per mu. In addition, the state-owned cotton farm's trial planting of long-staple cotton was also successful, with Sea Island cotton being the best, with a fiber length of 36 mm.
    Turpan's cotton output has been increasing year by year. In 1950, the average yield per mu was 140 jin, which was more than double that of 1950 in 1954. The quality of cotton has also greatly improved due to the expansion of the area planted with Soviet cotton seeds. In particular, the successful trial planting of long-staple cotton has pointed out a new direction for cotton production in Turpan.

    吐鲁番去年棉花大面积丰产
    一九五四年新疆省吐鲁番县的棉花获得了空前的大面积丰产。全县棉田共四万零五百八十九亩（占农作物播种总面积的百分之十八点八八），总产量一千二百七十八万二千多斤，每亩平均产籽棉三百一十四斤半。在使用苏联棉种的棉田中，有三分之一的棉田产量高达四百斤到九百二十九斤；棉作试验场九亩半苏联棉种，每亩产量达一千三百二十四斤。此外，国营棉作场试种长绒棉也获得成功，其中以海岛棉为最佳，纤维长度达三十六公厘。
    吐鲁番的棉花产量是逐年提高的。一九五○年每亩平均为一百四十斤，一九五四年比一九五○年提高了一倍以上。棉花质量由于苏联棉种面积的扩大，也有了很大的提高，特别是长绒棉试种成功，给吐鲁番棉花生产又指示了新的方向。
