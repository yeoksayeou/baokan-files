Xinhua News Agency, January 5th: Paris Dispatch: The United States, using so-called "aid" to intervene in Indochina, is doing its utmost to weaken France's economic and political position in Bao Dai's Vietnam. This has caused serious anxiety among French capitalists.

    "Le Monde" published an article by its Saigon correspondent, which talked about the reduction of French economic activities in South Vietnam. Faced with the anti-French policies encouraged and clearly demonstrated by the Ngo Dinh Diem government in Saigon, French business owners in Saigon are now rushing to sell their businesses and transfer their money to Cambodia or French territories in Africa.

    The correspondent pointed out that U.S. Special Envoy to Saigon, General Collins, has given more than one billion piastres to the Ngo Dinh Diem government. The United States has planned to give 100 million U.S. dollars in "aid" directly to South Vietnam in 1955. France has absolutely no right to control this "aid," which is a heavy blow to France's position in South Vietnam. The article bluntly pointed out that the United States is trying to eliminate French enterprises in Indochina.

    "Le Figaro" commented on the U.S. decision to directly aid South Vietnam on the 3rd, saying that this measure "seriously damages trade between France and Saigon." "Le Figaro" said: A "new economic relationship" will be established between France and Bao Dai's Vietnam in 1955, "which will cause France to lose its best customer besides Algeria within a few weeks." "Le Figaro," quoting a dispatch from its Saigon correspondent, also said: "French civilians in Saigon are uneasy about the Paris Agreement passed a few days ago and pointed out that the United States' direct provision of aid to Vietnam, controlled by American experts, is a serious blow to French exports to Vietnam."
    Xinhua News Agency, January 4th: TASS, Paris, January 3rd: French business circles are uneasy about American monopoly capital squeezing out France in South Vietnam. This anxiety is even revealed in newspapers that have always advocated so-called "Franco-American cooperation" in Indochina.

      "Le Figaro's" Saigon correspondent reported that trade between France and South Vietnam has been severely damaged by the United States. The correspondent believes that France is losing "one of its best customers besides Algeria." The correspondent believes that the main reason for this phenomenon is the establishment of control by American economic and military experts in South Vietnam.

      In addition, the United States also takes care of Japan's dumping of cheap goods to South Vietnam, which will completely destroy France's economic position.

      The correspondent wrote that, coupled with the serious political crisis developing in Bao Dai's Vietnam, the United States' policy of supporting the Saigon government is harming French interests, which is creating a more unfavorable situation for France's economic position in Indochina.

      The correspondent said that some people in French business circles are sounding the alarm. The French National Cotton Weaving Industry Federation held an emergency meeting in Paris today, as they have been hit hardest by the U.S. activities in South Vietnam.

    美国加紧侵入南越排挤法国
    引起了法国资本家的严重不安
    【新华社五日讯】巴黎消息：美国利用所谓“援助”插足印度支那，极力削弱法国在保大越南的经济和政治地位。这已引起法国资本家的严重不安。
    “世界报”刊载了它驻西贡记者的一篇文章，其中谈到法国在南越的经济活动的削减。法国在西贡的工商企业的业主在面临着西贡的吴庭艳政府所鼓励的并且明显表现出来的反法政策的情况下，现在正在匆忙出售他们的企业，把钱转移到柬埔寨或法国在非洲的属地上去。
    记者指出，美国驻西贡特使柯林斯将军已把十亿以上的披阿斯特交给吴庭艳政府。美国已经计划好在一九五五年把一亿美元的“援助”直接给予南越。法国完全无权控制这笔“援助”，这对法国在南越的地位是一个沉重的打击。这篇文章直率地指出，美国正在设法把法国在印度支那的企业清除掉。
    “费加罗报”三日评论美国决定直接给南越援助一事时说，这种措施“严重地损害法国和西贡之间的贸易”。“费加罗报”说：一九五五年法国和保大越南之间将建立一种“新的经济关系，这种关系将在几个星期之内使法国失去除了阿尔及利亚之外的最好的主顾”。“费加罗报”在引用驻西贡记者的电讯时又说：“西贡的法国平民对几天前通过巴黎协定一事感到不安，并且指出美国把援助直接交给由美国专家们控制着的越南，对法国向越南的输出是一个严重的打击。”
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社巴黎三日讯：法国商界人士对美国垄断资本在南越排挤法国表示不安。这种不安情绪甚至在向来主张在印度支那实行所谓“法美合作”的报纸上也都流露出来。
      “费加罗报”驻西贡记者报道，法国和南越的贸易已被美国严重地破坏了。记者认为，法国正在丧失“除阿尔及利亚以外的最好的一个主顾”。记者认为产生这一现象的主要原因是美国经济专家和军事专家在南越建立了控制。
    除此以外，美国还照顾日本向南越廉价倾销货物，这样就将彻底地破坏法国的经济地位。
    记者写道，加上保大越南的严重政治危机正在发展，美国实行支持西贡政府的政策损害法国利益，这就给法国在印度支那的经济地位造成更不利的局面。
    记者说，法国某些商界人士正在发出警号。法国全国棉织业联合会今天已在巴黎举行紧急会议，美国在南越的活动对他们的打击最厉害。
