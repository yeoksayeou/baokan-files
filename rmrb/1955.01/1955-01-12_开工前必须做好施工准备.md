    Construction Preparation Must Be Done Well Before Starting Work
    Strengthening construction preparation is a major issue in current capital construction. In the past, units that did this work well also achieved very good results. The Northeast Fifth Engineering Company of the Ministry of Construction, which was responsible for building the Electricity Meter and Instrument Factory, is one example. After most of the construction drawings arrived, and with the agreement of both the construction unit and the construction company, they carried out four months of construction preparation. As a result, construction was very balanced after work started, eliminating phenomena such as idling and rushing work, and fully completing the construction plan. The completion time of its main project, Plant 1, was 45 days ahead of the original national plan; the average attendance rate reached 96.05%, exceeding the national plan target by 1.05%; the original plan was to reduce costs by 490 million yuan, but the actual reduction was 510 million yuan; the original plan was to use 5.5 to 5.8 workdays per square meter of construction, but only 5 workdays were actually used. Facts have proven that doing a good job in construction preparation is an important method to ensure the comprehensive completion of the national plan.
    However, in the capital construction work of the past few years, the phenomenon of neglecting construction preparation and starting work rashly was also very serious. Before construction, many projects did not make construction organization designs based on technical designs and construction drawings, comprehensively deploy construction plans, plan the layout of the construction site, prepare construction budgets, balance construction conditions, or formulate various plans; nor did they organize workers well to study the drawings and familiarize themselves with operating procedures, but rushed to start construction based only on partial construction drawings and inaccurate plans. After construction started, very abnormal phenomena occurred, such as inaccurate plans, untimely supply, work stoppages waiting for drawings, equipment, and materials, or stopping this project to wait for that project, or idling while rushing work; the progress of construction was slow, and rework accidents occurred continuously. At the construction site, there were insufficient traffic lines, unreasonable placement of materials, lack of wind, electricity, and water, or the output of affiliated enterprises was too large or too small, which affected each other's work.
    Under such circumstances, it was impossible to adopt advanced Soviet construction methods in a planned way, nor was it possible to widely promote mechanized construction, resulting in very low labor productivity and serious waste. For example, the newly built boiler factory of the First Ministry of Machinery Industry, in a situation where preparation work was very insufficient, the construction unit urged the construction company to start work, and the construction company rashly started work without considering the consequences. The situation after construction started was: the No. 2 factory building under construction only had external drawings, and not a single internal drawing had arrived. When laying the basement foundation, they had to leave holes everywhere to prepare for the installation of various pipes and wires. The No. 2 factory building was completed, but no one could say when the drawings for other factory buildings would arrive or whether continuous construction could be guaranteed. After the civil engineering was completed, most of the non-standard equipment had not been found a manufacturing factory, and the machine installation could not be carried out immediately. There was no guarantee at all that the entire project could be put into production ahead of schedule. Judging from the already started No. 2 factory building site, in the one month from October 4 to November 4 last year, the plan was disrupted more than seven times, and the amount of work completed, calculated according to normal construction efficiency, could have been completed in only 15.5 days. At present, construction sites like this are not isolated cases.
    Why has the phenomenon of starting work rashly without sufficient preparation been present for several years? Of course, there are also many objective reasons. For example, some important projects are determined late, and the construction period is tight, so it is necessary to rush work when certain construction conditions are lacking. The design year cannot be advanced, the design changes frequently, and the supply of drawings and equipment is not timely, which also makes the preparation work lack a sufficient basis. Lack of management experience and low technical level make it difficult to immediately establish a normal construction order, etc., are also reasons. These are the current difficulties in construction preparation and construction management, and these difficulties cannot be completely resolved immediately. However, the mistake of starting work rashly cannot be blamed entirely on these reasons. Because many projects do not have the above difficulties, or although there are some difficulties, they can be overcome with effort. For these projects, the mistake of starting work rashly is mostly caused by subjective reasons. For example, some construction units disregard the basic construction procedures and do not actively create conditions for the construction company to strengthen construction preparation, but only blindly urge work to start. Some construction companies only wait for the construction unit to create conditions for themselves, and cannot actively prepare before construction based on the existing and possibly obtainable conditions, nor can they strengthen the preparation of each stage according to the characteristics of the supply of drawings during the construction process, so that the early stage prepares for the later stage, the upper section prepares for the lower section, and the previous month prepares for the next month. As a result, the preparation work cannot keep up with the construction.
    Why do the above phenomena occur in these construction units or construction companies? Why do some projects that are fully qualified or basically qualified to do a good job in preparation before starting work still have the phenomenon of starting work rashly? In addition to the leading cadres of these units not clearly recognizing the complexity of industrial capital construction and not understanding the harm of this approach, there are various excuses to cover up this wrong practice.
    Some people exaggerate the difficulty that the design cannot meet the construction requirements, and believe that "Since the design cannot keep up with the construction, it is impossible to wait until all the drawings arrive before starting work, and it is impossible to prepare well. It is better to start work early than late. Confusion and waste are inevitable!" This view is completely wrong. For important projects, the technical and economic aspects of the project must be calculated accurately. Blindly rushing for time is irresponsible to the people and the country. Therefore, the drawings must be waited for, and it is still a discipline that must be observed that work is not allowed to start without a design. However, today, at the beginning of a project, it is sometimes difficult to obtain all the drawings, but even in this case, it does not mean that it is permissible to start work rashly, or not to do a good job in construction preparation; instead, it should still be required within the possible range that the design unit carry out the design according to the order of construction. First supply the drawings to affiliated enterprises such as processing plants, and then supply the drawings to the foundation engineering. If the construction unit can actively organize the technical supply from all aspects according to the construction sequence, and the construction company can carry out construction preparation according to certain technical conditions, and can also maintain a certain reserve of drawings after construction starts, it can also ensure the start of work with preparation to the greatest extent and avoid confusion and waste. This is completely different from the practice of those who do not prepare in advance, do not understand the reserve of designs and equipment and the reliable delivery date, and rush to start work with only a few construction drawings.
    Some people are enthusiastic and lack calculation, do not ask about construction conditions, and believe that "Starting work early can lead to early completion, which can enable new enterprises to be put into production ahead of schedule, which can accumulate more funds for the country, while strengthening preparation work will affect the construction speed." This statement is also completely wrong. To say that "strengthening preparation work" will "affect the construction speed" is simply advocating blindness. As a result, it is not only impossible to "accumulate more funds for the country," but it will cause serious losses. Of course, it is absolutely necessary to put new enterprises into production on time, but only by fully doing a good job in construction preparation can the speed be accelerated. On the contrary, it is often "more haste, less speed." For more than two years, some projects have started work rashly under this pretext, resulting in very chaotic work, very serious waste, and the project still cannot be completed ahead of schedule. This lesson should be deeply remembered and never repeated.
    There is also an excuse that "There are many major projects in the future, and it is difficult to do several at the same time in a year. Therefore, even if the preparation work for some projects is insufficient, work has to start, otherwise it will affect the overall construction speed." The consideration is not entirely unreasonable, but it is always wrong to "start work" when "the preparation work is insufficient," especially when "major projects" start work without sufficient preparation, it will bring major damage to the country. On the other hand, since we have been working for more than two years and have accumulated some construction experience, since our construction team is stronger than in the past, and since the design level and the management and technical level of construction and installation enterprises have improved compared to the past, why not use these favorable conditions to adopt an active and steady approach? For example, try to improve the quality of domestic design, properly arrange the delivery date of drawings, strengthen planning and balancing work, properly arrange the progress of various key projects, strengthen the scheduling of technical trades, and actively cultivate technical forces. Can we continue to take the road of chaos and waste? Obviously, it should not be.
    Some people also believe that "Under the current conditions, the construction preparation work will never be very thorough. Starting work early can discover the shortcomings of the preparation work and facilitate correcting these shortcomings; at the same time, because we lack experience, we can train the construction force through construction practice." This idea is also wrong. This ideologically affirms that there should be shortcomings before construction, and even no matter how serious the shortcomings are, go to "construction practice" to "train the construction force"! It should be known that only by starting work after making full preparations can the shortcomings discovered after starting work not affect the balance of construction and not cause chaos. On the contrary, if many problems arise after starting work, it will be even more difficult to solve them temporarily; and being busy solving these problems will not allow more energy to be devoted to establishing a normal construction management order and improving the management level of enterprises. Therefore, precisely because we have no experience, and we have to complete complex basic construction tasks, we especially need to strengthen construction preparation.
    Today, we can no longer ignore the work of strengthening construction preparation, and we can no longer let go of a certain preparation time before construction. Starting in 1955, the amount of engineering has greatly increased, and the scale and technical complexity of construction far exceed the present. If we cannot quickly overcome the confusion in management, establish a normal construction order, and comprehensively improve management and technical levels, it will be difficult to shoulder the increasingly heavy task of industrial capital construction.
    Strengthening construction preparation is a complex task, and it cannot be done well all at once. Many problems cannot be solved solely by the construction department, and require the active efforts of various departments. The construction unit needs to actively create conditions for the construction company, and it must also prevent the phenomenon of the construction company starting work only after "everything is ready." To this end, all industrial departments are required to carefully consider the reserve and delivery date of drawings, the accuracy of the equipment and material supply plan, the balance of construction, the connection between the construction, installation, and production preparation stages, the arrangement of construction climaxes, and how to facilitate the improvement of construction management and technical levels when summarizing the industrial capital construction work in 1954, formulating the construction plan for 1955, and determining the start date of key projects, on the premise of ensuring that the completion date is not delayed. This is an important part of strengthening the leadership of industrial capital construction. As long as we always work in accordance with the instructions of the Party and the government, as long as everyone actively learns from Soviet experience as in the past, and as long as everyone tirelessly studies their business, we will surely be able to do a better job in industrial capital construction and achieve greater results.

### 开工前必须做好施工准备

    开工前必须做好施工准备
    加强施工准备是目前基本建设中的重大问题。过去凡是作好这一工作的单位，也都收到了很好的效果。建筑工程部东北第五工程公司承建的电表仪器厂便是一个例子。他们在大部分施工图纸到达后，在建筑单位和施工单位双方同意下，进行了四个月的施工准备，结果开工后施工很均衡，基本上消灭了窝工、突击现象，全面地完成了建设计划。它的主要工程一厂房的完工时间比国家原定计划提前四十五天；出勤率平均达到百分之九十六点零五，超过国家计划指标的百分之一点零五；原计划降低成本四亿九千万元，实际完成五亿一千万元；原计划建筑一平方公尺需五点五至五点八个工日，实际只用了五个工日。事实证明，作好施工准备是保证全面完成国家计划的重要方法。
    但在过去几年的基本建设工作中，忽视施工准备，草率开工的现象也是很严重的。不少的工程在施工前既没有根据技术设计和施工图作好施工组织设计，全面部署施工的方案，规划施工现场的布置，编制施工预算，平衡施工条件，制定各种计划；也没有很好地组织工人学习图纸，熟悉操作规程，只是根据部分施工图和不精确的计划，就仓促开始施工。开工以后，就发生了计划不准确，供应不及时，停工等待图纸、设备、材料，或停止这项工程等待那项工程，或一边窝工一边突击等极不正常的现象；建设进度迟缓，返工事故不断发生。在施工现场上，不是交通线路不够，就是材料放置的不合理，或者少风、缺电、无水，再就是附属企业的产量过大或过小，工作起来相互影响。
    在这种情况下，既不可能有计划地采用苏联先进的施工方法，也不可能广泛推行机械化施工，因而劳动生产率很低，浪费现象严重。例如第一机械工业部新建的锅炉厂，在准备工作十分不足的情况下，建筑单位就催促施工单位开工，施工单位也不考虑后果便草率地动工了。动工以后的情况是：正在建筑的二厂房只有外部图纸，内部图纸一张都没有到，打地下室基础的时候，不得不到处留洞，以备安装各种管道和电线。第二厂房完成了，其他厂房的图纸什么时候到，能否保证连续施工，也没有人可以说得出。土建工程完成了，还有大部非标准设备没有找到承制的厂子，也不能马上进行机器安装，整个工程能否提前投入生产，完全没有保证。从已动工的二厂房工地来看，由去年十月四日到十一月四日的一个月中，计划被打乱了七次以上，所完成的工作量如按正常施工效率计算，只需十五点五天即可完成。目前，像这样的工地并不是个别的。
    为什么准备工作不充分就草率开工的现象几年来一直存在着呢？当然也有很多客观的原因。例如某些重要工程确定的晚，工期紧，不得不在某些施工条件欠缺的情况下赶工。设计年度不能提前，设计经常变动，图纸与设备供应不及时，也使准备工作没有充分依据。管理经验少、技术水平低，难于马上建立正常的施工秩序等也是原因。这些，都是目前施工准备和施工管理工作的困难，这些困难是不能马上完全解决的。但是，绝不能把草率开工的错误都推到这些原因上去。因为很多工程并不存在以上的困难，或者虽然有一些困难，只要经过努力也是可以克服的。对这些工程说来，草率开工的错误倒是由主观原因造成的居多。例如有的建筑单位不顾基本建设程序，也不积极为施工单位创造加强施工准备的条件，只是一味督促开工。有些施工单位，只是坐等建筑单位给自己创造条件，既不能在施工前根据已有的和可能争取到的条件，积极进行准备，又未在施工过程中根据图纸供应的特点，加强每一阶段的准备，作到前期为后期准备、上段为下段准备，上月为下月准备，结果准备工作跟不上施工。
    为什么在这些建筑单位或施工单位中会产生以上的现象呢？为什么在完全有条件或大体上有了条件可以作好准备工作后开工的某些工程，仍然存在草率开工的现象呢？除了这些单位的领导干部还没有清楚认识到工业基本建设的复杂性，没有理解这种做法的危害之外，它有着各种各样的借口，掩盖了这种错误的作法。
    有的人过份夸大设计不能满足施工要求的困难，认为“既然设计赶不上施工，就不可能等图纸都到了再开工，也不可能准备得很好。晚开工不如早开工，混乱和浪费是不可避免的！”这种看法是完全错误的。重要的工程，必须精确计算工程的技术和经济，盲目地抢时间，就是对人民和国家不负责任，因而，图纸必须等待，没有设计不准开工仍然是必须遵守的纪律。但是今天在一项工程开工之初，要求得到全部图纸，有时是困难的，但就在这种情况下，也并不是说就可以允许草率开工，或不作好施工准备；而仍然应该在可能范围内，要求设计单位按照施工顺序的先后，进行设计。先供给加工厂等附属企业以图纸，再供给基础工程以图纸。如果建筑单位能积极从各方面依照施工顺序组织技术供应，而施工单位又能根据一定的技术条件进行施工准备，开工后又能保持一定的图纸储备量，也是可以在最大程度上保证有准备地开工，避免混乱和浪费。这和那些事先不准备，也不了解设计和设备的储备量和可靠的交付日期，只抓到几张施工图纸就抢着开工的做法毫无相同之处。
    有的人热情高，计算少，不问施工条件，认为“早开工可以早竣工，可以使新建的企业提前投入生产，就可以给国家积累更多的资金，而加强准备工作，会影响建设速度。”这种说法也完全是错误的，说“加强准备工作”，就“会影响建设速度”，这只不过是提倡盲目性，结果，不但不可能“给国家积累更多的资金”，反而会造成严重损失。当然，使新建企业按时投入生产是完全必需的，但是只有充分作好施工准备，才能加快速度。反之，则常常是“欲速不达”。两年多来，有些工程在这种借口下草率开工了，结果工作十分混乱，浪费十分严重，工程仍然不能提前竣工。这种教训，应该深深记取，绝不能重蹈覆辙。
    还有一种借口，就是认为“未来的重大工程很多，一年内要同时干几个是困难的，因而尽管有些工程的准备工作不足也得开工，否则就会影响总的建设速度”。考虑不是毫无道理的，但“准备工作不足”就“开工”总是错误的，特别是“重大工程”准备不足就开工，将给国家带来重大损害。而另一方面既然我们已经干了两年多，已经积累了一些建设经验，既然我们建设的队伍已比过去强大，既然设计水平和建筑安装企业的管理水平和技术水平已比过去提高了，又为什么不利用这些有利的条件采用积极稳重的办法呢？比如，设法提高国内设计质量、恰当安排图纸的交付日期、加强计划和平衡工作、适当排列各重点工程的进度、加强技术工种的调度、积极培养技术力量等。难道可以继续走混乱和浪费的道路吗？显然是不应该的。
    也有人认为：“在目前条件下，施工准备工作总不会十分周到，早开工可以发现准备工作的缺点，便于纠正这些缺点；同时，因为我们缺乏经验，可以通过施工的实践锻炼施工力量”。这种想法同样是错误的，这在思想上就肯定了好像在施工前就应有缺点，甚至不管是怎样严重的缺点，到“施工的实践”中去“锻炼施工的力量”吧！须知，只有先作充分准备后开工，开工后发现的缺点才不会影响施工的均衡，才不致于引起混乱。反之，开工后出现很多问题，临时解决就更会困难；而忙于解决这些问题，就不能有更多精力去建立正常的施工管理秩序、提高企业的管理水平。因此，正因为我们没有经验，而又要完成复杂的基本建设任务，就特别需要加强施工准备。
    今天，我们再不能忽视加强施工准备这一工作了，再不能放过在施工前的一定的准备时间了。从一九五五年开始，工程量大大增加了，建设规模和技术的复杂性也远远超过现在，如果我们不能迅速地克服管理上的混乱，建立正常的施工秩序，全面提高管理水平和技术水平，便难以担负愈来愈重大的工业基本建设任务。
    加强施工准备是一项复杂的工作，不是一下子就可以做得好的，很多问题也不能只靠施工部门单独去解决，需要各个部门的积极努力，需要建筑单位积极给施工单位创造条件，也必须防止施工单位“万事俱备”再开工的现象发生。为此，要求所有工业部门在总结一九五四年工业基本建设工作、制订一九五五年建设计划、确定重点工程开工日期的时候，一定要在保证不延缓竣工日期的前提下，慎重考虑到图纸的储备量和交付日期、设备材料供应计划的准确程度、施工的均衡、建筑、安装、生产准备各阶段之间的衔接、施工高潮的安排、如何便于提高施工的管理水平和技术水平等。这是加强工业基本建设领导的重要内容。只要我们时刻遵照党和政府的指示去工作，只要大家像过去一样积极学习苏联经验，只要大家不懈地钻研业务，就一定能把工业基本建设工作做得更好，一定能获得更大的成绩。
