    In the Joyful Spring Festival
    Mao Zedong's Former Residence in Shazhouba Opens to the Public
    The people of Shazhouba Village, Ruijin County, Jiangxi Province—the site of the Central Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government during the Second Revolutionary Civil War and where Chairman Mao once lived—joyfully celebrated the Spring Festival.
    On the morning of the Spring Festival, Chairman Mao's former residence in Shazhouba opened to the public. Groups of young people, arm in arm, came to pay their respects. Veteran Red Army soldiers such as Yang Shiliang, Yang Ronglian, and Yang Yanqiu, who had participated in the anti-"encirclement and suppression" campaigns under Chairman Mao's personal leadership, told the young people stories of the struggle during the Second Revolutionary Civil War in the house where Chairman Mao lived. The former office sites of the Land Department, Finance Department, and General Affairs Department of the Central Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government, as well as the homes of many revolutionary martyrs' families, revolutionary military families, and revolutionary soldiers, were also filled with people celebrating the Spring Festival today. Everyone happily talked about the changes in Shazhouba over the years. Yang Haifa, secretary of the Shazhouba branch of the Communist Party of China, said: "Since the Red Army went north to fight against the Japanese, the people of Shazhouba have lived a hard life of eating bran and vegetables all year round. Now, not only does every household have enough to eat and use, but all sixty-two peasant households in the village have surplus grain."

    The Joyful Workers' Village in Shenyang
    On the eve of the Spring Festival, the Workers' Village in Shenyang was filled with joy. It was a rare good day since the beginning of winter, and the snow had begun to melt. This workers' village, which consists of one hundred and sixteen three-story buildings, houses more than 30,000 employees and their families. They happily welcomed the Spring Festival of the third year of the Five-Year Plan. Some doors were covered with red couplets, congratulating the great victories of the socialist construction cause. The food and supplies sold by the Workers' Village Cooperative to the workers this year were more than in any previous year. People in the village streets wore new clothes, and children set off firecrackers.
    At night, the Workers' Village was ablaze with lights, and dozens of red and green honorary lights were particularly bright. Ju Fuhai, the leader of the machine assembly workshop of the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory, which has been rated as an advanced production group for three consecutive years, and his family felt very happy and fortunate during the Spring Festival. Ju Fuhai's mother pointed to the portrait of Chairman Mao hanging on the wall and said with a smile: "Our good life today is all because of Chairman Mao's good leadership." Ju Fuhai said enthusiastically: "The workers in our factory are very enthusiastic about building socialism and are determined to better fulfill the state production plan."

    Lhasa Military and Civilians Celebrate Joyfully
    The organs and troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's Tibet Military Region stationed in Lhasa, the staff of state-owned enterprises and institutions in Lhasa, and the People's Liberation Army troops and workers constructing the Kangzang and Qingzang highways, celebrated the first Spring Festival after the opening of the Kangzang and Qingzang highways.
    Recently, trucks loaded with goods have been continuously driving into Lhasa, bringing large quantities of meat and fresh fruit. The state-owned Tibet Trading Corporation remained open during the Spring Festival, and the stores were crowded with customers all day long, carefully selecting clothing, utensils, and holiday food. The Lhasa Supply Station of the Xinhua Bookstore transported a batch of books before the Spring Festival, and people came here in groups of three or five to buy their favorite books and colored New Year pictures. On the Spring Festival day, the weather in Lhasa was sunny and warm, and laughter and singing could be heard from the groves in the suburbs. Tibetan and Han staff members held picnics in the suburbs. These days, there have been evening parties and dances in Lhasa every night. The streets of Lhasa are particularly lively, with Tibetan men and women farmers and herdsmen purchasing various exquisite industrial products transported from the interior, and many citizens are busy preparing new clothes to welcome the Tibetan New Year, which is coming in just over twenty days. During the Spring Festival, some units invited Tibetan neighbors and guests to celebrate the holiday together, and some Tibetans brought hadas to the troops'驻地 to congratulate the soldiers on the New Year.
    In the suburbs of Lhasa and along the Kangzang Highway, road builders celebrated the Spring Festival holiday. Many companies and work teams held discussion meetings to discuss how to implement new tasks and further promote patriotic labor competitions.

    We Must Run Ahead of the Flood Season
    The Wuhan Municipal People's Spring Festival慰问团 visited eighty basic construction and dike construction sites throughout the city three days before the Spring Festival to慰问 more than 60,000 workers. The慰问团 brought a large number of慰问 letters to the workers and performed wonderful cultural programs. The workers also reported to the慰问团 on their overcoming difficulties to complete construction tasks. The慰问团 gave the workers great encouragement. The workers building the Hanshui Highway Bridge overcame the difficulty of the long suspension bridge and created a new record of driving two and a half piles in one shift, and completed the task of driving thirty-eight straight piles for the No. 3 pier to welcome the arrival of the慰问团. Workers of the Second Detachment of the Third Squadron of the Hanyang Qindankou Quarry created a new record of blasting 5,000 cubic meters of stone with one shot by using the "large-scale blasting method." When the慰问团 arrived at the Daijiashan construction site, the workers building the dike said: "Our work is to race against the flood, and we must run ahead of the flood." They guaranteed full attendance during and after the Spring Festival, resolutely completing the project tasks before the flood season to thank the people of the city for their care.

    The Model Hygiene Village is Cleaned Even More Thoroughly
    The national first-class hygiene model unit, Wulao Village in the suburbs of Nanjing, celebrated the Spring Festival cleanly and neatly. In many people's homes, the floors were as clean as the tables, and the window glass was as bright as mirrors. Many families posted Spring Festival couplets that read: "Good hygiene prolongs life, and hard work provides ample food and clothing." Children wore neat new clothes to prepare for the Spring Festival.
    This year, it snowed heavily, which added many difficulties to the lives and sanitation work of the residents of Wulao Village. Therefore, the village's patriotic health campaign working group first mobilized the masses to carry out a thorough cleaning, piling the snow on the streets, roofs, and around the houses in the vegetable watering ponds and open spaces.
    A thorough cleaning of the interior has become a way of life for the masses here. Zhang Chenshi, a family member of a worker in the district's third-class hygiene model, has a truly bright and clean home, with no dust from the rafters to the floor. She said: "Every morning when I get up, in addition to cooking for my husband, I must first tidy up the pebbles on the railway in front of the door, clean the small ditch in front of the door, and then mop the floor and wash things. I can't stand it if I don't do this one day. Everyone in the family can't step on the floor without changing their shoes."
    Cao Muguang, an old woman in a military family, said: "Old superstitions only掸尘 on the day of祭灶. Usually, on days such as '土王用事' and 'not suitable for洒扫,' one cannot clean. Now, we don't talk about that anymore. We do a big cleaning once or twice a month."

    The Boatmen's Cultural Palace During the Festival
    On the eve of the Spring Festival, countless wooden sailboats sailed from the source of the Xiang River and docked in the Xinde Wharf area of Changsha. Cadres of the Changsha Water District People's Government went on board to give New Year's greetings and admission tickets to the boatmen. On the afternoon of the Spring Festival, the boatmen happily took their families and children out of the cabins and flocked to the newly built Boatmen's Cultural Palace on Shuiluzhou to participate in the Spring Festival party. Here, people could see the boatmen who used to be active on the Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li four water transport lines. A few days ago, they transported tens of thousands of tons of materials to the lake治湖 construction site and transported grain from the mountainous and hilly areas of the province to the disaster-stricken counties around the lake. Today, they have completed the transportation tasks given by the state and are passing through Changsha to celebrate the Spring Festival. They enjoyed the flower drum operas such as "Happy Festival" and "Cannot Take That Road" performed by the Cultural Palace, and burst into laughter from time to time. They remembered that the beautiful Cultural Palace was located on Shuiluzhou, which was a place where sailors from imperialist countries used to get drunk and have fun before liberation, but now it has become their own Cultural Palace. The boatmen used to be on the water all day and night. Now they can often come here to enjoy the happiness after work and overlook the Xiang River like a belt and the towering Yuelu Mountain.

On the eve of the Spring Festival, Hu Hongyi's family, who lived in Haishigou Hexia, Hangzhou, had been decorated neatly and cleanly. On the香柜桌 in a guest room were New Year cakes and pentagonal palace lanterns sent from the residents of the Haishigou Hexia residential area and nearby elementary schools. Hu Hongyi's mother was preparing dinner in the kitchen. Hu Hongyi put on a newly made navy blue gabardine Zhongshan suit and a cyan-gray gabardine overcoat, and the whole family also changed into holiday clothes. On this day, his classmates and friends whom he had not seen for more than six years, as well as Young Pioneers he had not known in the past, came to his home to express their condolences. Hu Hongyi said: "Wherever I go, people welcome me so warmly, which makes me deeply feel the warmth of the motherland. In the future, I am determined to dedicate my youth to our motherland." During the Spring Festival, Hu Hongyi's entire family was immersed in the joy of the New Year. His two younger sisters and elder sister took a vacation from their work posts and schools to return home. They talked with Hu Hongyi about the changes in the motherland in the five years since liberation. In the morning, the whole family gathered in the guest room to listen to his little niece and nephew sing songs, tell stories, and watch them dance. They had a reunion dinner at noon and planned to visit West Lake, watch a movie, or go to a storytelling performance. Hu Hongyi's mother said emotionally: "I don't know how many tears I have shed for my Hongyi. Every New Year, I think of him. Now he has jumped out of hell, and the child has returned to his mother's arms." As she spoke, a happy smile appeared on her face, and the whole family felt gratified for their mother's happy old age.

    卫生模范村打扫得更干净
    全国甲等卫生模范单位南京市郊的五老村，干干净净欢度春节。在很多群众家里，地板打扫得和桌子一样干净，窗玻璃擦得和镜子一样明亮。很多人家门上贴着：“讲卫生延年益寿，爱劳动丰衣足食”的春联，孩子们穿戴着整洁的新衣准备过春节。
    今年雪下得很大，给五老村居民的生活和卫生工作增加了不少困难；因此，村爱国卫生运动工作组就首先发动群众进行了大清扫，把街道上、屋顶上、房前房后的积雪都堆到浇菜的水塘和空地上。
    室内大清洗在这里已经成了群众的生活习惯。区的丙等卫生模范张陈氏是个工人家属，她家真是明窗净几，从屋上的椽子到地板没有一点灰尘。她说：我每天早上一起身，除了给丈夫做饭以外，一定先要整理好门前铁路上的石子，清扫门前的小沟，然后再拖地板、擦洗东西，哪一天不这样做我就看不惯，家里每个人不换鞋子就不踏上地板。
    军属曹慕光老太太说：“老迷信只有祭灶那天掸尘，平时又是什么‘土王用事’‘不宜洒扫’的日子都不能打扫，现在，我们不讲那一套了，一个月就要大打扫一两次。”
