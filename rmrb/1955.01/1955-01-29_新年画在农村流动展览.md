The Chinese Artists Association and the People's Fine Arts Publishing House are jointly holding the "1955 New Year Pictures Exhibition" during the Spring Festival. One hundred and fourteen types of New Year pictures have been selected, with two copies of each type, mounted into two identical sets, which will be taken by two exhibition work teams to the old revolutionary base areas and rural areas and towns near Beijing for mobile exhibitions. One team will go to Jianping, Pingshan and other places for exhibition; the other team will first exhibit in Nanyuan, then go through Guangdezhuang and other rural areas to Tong County. The purpose of this exhibition is mainly to let New Year pictures penetrate into rural areas, to congratulate farmers on the Spring Festival, and to enrich rural Spring Festival cultural and artistic activities. At the same time, opinions on New Year pictures are being solicited from farmers so that they can be compiled and used as reference for artists in future creations. Both teams are equipped with slide projectors and many color slides, so that after the New Year picture exhibition is held during the day, the slides can be shown in the evening.

    新年画在农村流动展览
    中国美术家协会和人民美术出版社，春节期间联合举办“一九五五年新年画展览”。已选定新年画一百一十四种，每种两份，装裱成同样的两套，由两个展览工作队，分别带到老根据地和北京附近农村、城镇作流动展出。一队到建屏、平山等地展览；另一队先到南苑展出，然后经广德庄等农村到通县。这次展览的目的，主要是让新年画深入农村，并向农民庆贺春节，和丰富农村春节文化艺术活动，同时向农民征求对于新年画的意见，以便整理后供画家们今后创作时参考。这两个队都随带了幻灯机和不少彩色幻灯片，白天举行了年画展览后，晚上还可以放映幻灯。
