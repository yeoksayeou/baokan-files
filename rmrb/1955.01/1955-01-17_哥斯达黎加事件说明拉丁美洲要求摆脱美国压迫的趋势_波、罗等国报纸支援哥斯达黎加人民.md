Xinhua News Agency, 16th: According to reports from the Polish and Romanian News Agencies: Polish and Romanian newspapers commented on the invasion of Costa Rica.

    An article published in the Polish "People's Tribune" stated: When we recall the invasion of Guatemala, the recent death of Brazilian President Vargas, or the armed coups that have occurred in other Latin American countries in the past, the Costa Rica incident provides yet another example of the means used by American monopoly capital to suppress even the slightest attempt by Latin American countries to break free from dependence on American capital. This incident also illustrates the oppression suffered by Latin American countries under American control. The article pointed out: On the other hand, the frequent use of drastic measures by American monopoly capital to maintain its dominance in Latin America proves the existence of another trend: the trend of Latin America breaking free from American exploitation. This trend can be seen not only among the broad masses of people who are impoverished by the exploitation of American monopoly capital, but also includes some figures in the ruling bourgeois groups who hope to be less dependent on the "protection" of American monopoly capital. The United States believes that this trend in Latin America can be stopped by force, but it has not considered that this will expose its true face in Latin American countries.

    "Free Romania" wrote that the events in Guatemala, Panama, and Costa Rica vividly illustrate the dirty tricks adopted by American monopoly capitalists to place the people of Central America under the yoke of their exploitation. The Romanian "Labor Newspaper" wrote: All honest people around the world are watching the struggle of the small countries of Central America for freedom and independence with sympathy and ardent support.

    Xinhua News Agency, 16th: According to TASS, London, 15th: The British magazine "New Statesman and Nation" published an editorial commenting on the role of the United States in the invasion of Costa Rica. The editorial stated that regardless of the outcome of this invasion, "the facts will prove that the United States bears significant responsibility."

    The editorial said: "The fact that the United States neither provides diplomatic assistance to Costa Rica nor gives it military aid makes people more suspicious that the State Department is at least tacitly encouraging President Somoza (of Nicaragua) to repeat the means that were very successfully used against Guatemala to deal with Costa Rica."

    The editorial added that Washington is using the likes of Somoza and the leaders of Venezuela to counter "communism," to provide military bases to protect the Panama Canal, and to safeguard the interests of American fruit, railway, electricity, and oil companies. The United States has been actively helping the most brutal and notorious figures in South America and colluding with them.

    The editorial concluded: "It is impossible to believe that Somoza would have taken action without being assured that he would be allowed to do so."

    哥斯达黎加事件说明拉丁美洲要求摆脱美国压迫的趋势
    波、罗等国报纸支援哥斯达黎加人民
     【新华社十六日讯】据波兰通讯社和罗马尼亚通讯社消息：波兰和罗马尼亚报纸评论哥斯达黎加遭受侵略。
    波兰“人民论坛报”刊登的一篇文章说：当我们回想起对危地马拉的侵略、巴西总统瓦加斯最近的死亡或者以前在其他拉丁美洲国家发生的武装政变的时候，哥斯达黎加事件提供了美国垄断资本为了镇压拉丁美洲国家中那怕是最轻微的企图摆脱对美国资本的依附的趋势所使用的手段的又一个例证。这个事件也说明了受美国控制的拉丁美洲国家所受到的压迫。文章指出：另一方面，美国垄断资本为了保持在拉丁美洲的统治而经常采取剧烈手段的做法，证明了另一种趋势存在：拉丁美洲摆脱美国剥削的趋势。这种趋势不仅在因受到美国垄断资本的剥削而陷于穷困的广大人民群众中间可以看得出来，而且还包括了资产阶级的统治集团中的一些人物，他们希望能在较大程度上不依赖美国垄断资本的“保护”。美国认为拉丁美洲的这种趋势可以用武力来加以阻止，但是它没有考虑到：这样一来会在拉丁美洲国家中暴露出自己的真面目。
    “自由罗马尼亚报”写道，危地马拉、巴拿马、哥斯达黎加的事件，生动地说明了美国垄断资本家为了把中美洲人民放在他们剥削的枷锁下所采取的肮脏手段。罗马尼亚“劳动报”写道：全世界正直的人们都以同情和热诚的声援注视着中美各小国争取自由和独立的斗争。
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社伦敦十五日讯：英国“新政治家与民族”杂志发表社论，评论美国在哥斯达黎加遭受侵略的事件中扮演的角色。社论说，不管这次侵略的结果如何，“事实将证明美国负有重大责任”。
    社论说：“美国既不给哥斯达黎加以外交上的援助，又不给它以军事上的援助，这使人们更加疑心国务院至少是默默地鼓励（尼加拉瓜）索摩查总统重复采用对危地马拉用得非常成功的手段来对付哥斯达黎加。”
    社论又说，华盛顿正在利用索摩查之流和委内瑞拉的领袖们来对付“共产主义”，来提供军事基地以保护巴拿马运河，维护美国果品、铁路、电力和石油企业的利益。美国一直在积极帮助南美洲的最残忍和声名狼藉的人物，并且同他们狼狈为奸。
    社论最后说：“不能相信索摩查在没有得到让他放手干的保证的情况下会采取行动。”
