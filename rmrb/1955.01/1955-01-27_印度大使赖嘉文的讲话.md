Mr. President, Colleagues, Friends:

    I am very grateful to you for your presence here tonight. India is grateful for the friendship and cooperation shown to it by all well-meaning people around the world.

    More than eight years ago, the meeting convened to draft the Constitution of the Republic of India declared one of its goals to be: "This ancient country should achieve its legitimate and glorious position in the world and make full and willing contributions to promoting world peace and human welfare." Serving the world and the people of all countries has always been the unwavering purpose and fundamental goal of those who created freedom for India. Therefore, it is only natural that this newborn republic attaches equal importance to its foreign policy, foreign relations, and its internal affairs. Once we regained our freedom, we set about restoring our ancient friendships and forging new friendly relations. All of these are highly valued and cherished by the new India.

    The friendship between India and China has been nourished by the past history of the two countries, so it is easy for the new India and the new China to unite again and build new relations on the ancient foundation. As the years go by, the world will increasingly recognize and appreciate the true significance of this great and growing friendship. The creators of modern China and the new India are enthusiastically and to the best of their ability further expanding the scope and content of this traditional friendship; they have made many efforts in this regard last year.

    On April 29 last year, we signed an agreement on "Trade and Transportation between the Tibet Region of China and India," which resolved the problems we faced in the region. This agreement also included the "Five Principles" determined by the Prime Ministers of the two countries as guidelines for international exchanges, which were later included in the world-renowned joint statement issued by them in New Delhi. This is a common approach proposed to ease international tensions.

    India has repeatedly raised the important issue that New China should enjoy legitimate status in international relations; otherwise, China cannot make an effective contribution to the thorough resolution of international tensions.

    In 1954, there was also an increase in exchanges between India and China. The two countries signed their first trade agreement in New Delhi on October 14, 1954.

    During this year, many delegations visited each other, one of the most outstanding of which has just completed its tour of India.

    In addition to the above, last year the Chinese Premier paid a short but significant visit to India. A Chinese Premier visiting India or an Indian Prime Minister visiting China has never happened in history. The warm and spontaneous welcome they both received shows how eagerly the people of these two countries looked forward to and how happily they welcomed these two visits.

    Indeed, 1954 was a year full of important events for India. Whether in Korea or Indochina, in Colombo or Jakarta, in Geneva or the United Nations, it has done its best for world peace and happiness. These are the goals solemnly declared by the founders of its constitution.

    The fact that India and China have emerged as free republics has profoundly influenced the face of history. Neither India nor China is a small country. They have nearly one billion people in the world's population. Their efforts in the cause of peace cannot but be an extremely important matter for the whole world. I believe that the friendship and understanding between India and China will be a beacon, showing people that two great countries can live in harmony and friendship for a long time without conflict and hatred; countries with different social ideologies and political systems, like individuals with different beliefs and opinions, can still become close and loyal friends, cooperating with each other and not interfering in each other's affairs. Peace and understanding between countries is an urgent requirement, and once it arises, it will inevitably expand and permeate into international relations.

    Today, we would like to assure once again that we will support friendship and understanding between countries.

    Please allow me to take this opportunity to propose a toast to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of China and the Chinese people!

### 印度大使赖嘉文的讲话

专栏：

    印度大使赖嘉文的讲话阁下，同事们，朋友们：
    今晚承各位光临此地，我非常感激。印度对于全世界善意对待它的人们所给予的友谊和合作是很感激的。
    八年多以前，为草拟印度共和国宪法而召开的会议曾宣布它的目标之一是：“这个古老的国家在世界上应取得其合法和光荣的地位，并对促进世界和平和人类福利做出充分和乐意的贡献。”为世界和为世界各国人民服务一直是那些为印度缔造了自由的人们的坚定不移的目的和基本的目标。因此，这个新生的共和国对它的外交政策、对外关系和对它的内部问题给予同等的重视，是很自然的。我们一旦重新获得了自由，便着手恢复我们古老的友谊，并铸造出新的友好关系。所有这些都是极受新印度重视和珍贵的。
    印度和中国的友谊受到了两国以往历史的滋润，因而新印度和新中国就容易再度团结起来，并在古老的基础上建立起新的关系。随着年月的逝去，世界将愈来愈认识和赞美这个伟大的、日益增长的友谊的真正意义。现代中国和新印度的创造者们正在热忱地、竭其所能地进一步扩大这种传统友谊的范围和内容；去年他们在这方面就曾作了很多努力。
    去年四月二十九日，我们签订了一个关于“中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通”的协定，解决了我们之间在该地区所面临的问题，这个协定也包含了为两国总理所确定的，作为国际交往准则的“五项原则”，后来他们在新德里发表的闻名于世的联合声明又将这五项原则包括在内。这是为了缓和国际紧张局势而共同提出的一个方针。
    印度一再提出新中国应在国际关系中享有合法地位的重要问题，否则中国就不能对彻底解决国际紧张局势作出有效的贡献。
    一九五四年，印度和中国之间的交往活动也有增加。两国于一九五四年十月十四日在新德里签订了第一个贸易协定。
    在这一年内，许多代表团互相进行了访问，其中最出色的一个刚完成了它在印度的观光。
    除了上面所提到的外，去年中国总理去印度作了一次短促但意义重大的访问。一个中国总理去印度访问或一个印度总理到中国来，在历史上是从未有过的。他们两人所受到的热烈、自发的欢迎，说明了这两国人民是如何热切地盼望和如何愉快地欢迎这两次访问。
    的确，一九五四年对印度来说，是充满了重要事件的一年。不管是在朝鲜或印度支那，在科伦坡或雅加达，在日内瓦或联合国，它为世界和平与幸福尽了最大努力。这些都是它的宪法的创始人庄严地宣布过的目标。
    印度和中国以自由的共和国出现的事实，已对历史的面貌产生了深刻的影响。印度和中国都不是小国。在世界人口中，他们拥有近十亿人。他们在和平事业中的努力对于全世界不能不是一件极为重要的事情。我相信印、中两国间的友谊和了解将是一座灯塔，使人们看到两个大国可以长期和睦与友好地相处，而没有冲突和仇恨；社会意识形态和政治制度不同的国家，就像持有不同的信仰与见解的个人一样，仍然可以成为亲热和忠实的朋友，相互合作，互不干涉对方的事务。国与国之间的和平与了解是刻不容缓的要求，一旦产生，就必将扩展和渗入到国际关系中去。
    今天，我们愿再一次保证我们将支持各国间的友好和了解。
    请允许我借此机会建议为中国和中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席的健康干杯！
