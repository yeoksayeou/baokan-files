    The "New France" weekly published the directive of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party on launching a new party member recruitment campaign in 1955. The directive stated: "The party's unwavering struggle in defending peace, striving for national independence, and striving to satisfy the demands of the working people achieved significant victories in 1954. The party's prestige has greatly increased throughout the country." In 1954, millions of urban and rural workers, advanced intellectuals, and other patriots further understood the decisive role of the Communist Party, thereby supporting the party's policies. The 1955 new party member recruitment campaign aims to recruit thousands of the most conscious, most knowledgeable, and most resolute people among these individuals into the party's ranks.
    The directive emphasized that this movement has a dual purpose: on the one hand, to strengthen the party by recruiting new party members and establishing new branches (especially in enterprises); on the other hand, to improve the political level of the party and each party member. The directive stated: "The party can and should strengthen its organization, thereby better leading the masses to fight victoriously and strive for a complete change in French policy..."
    The Political Bureau called on all party organizations to persist in the struggle to improve the political activities of the branches and raise the ideological level of each party member. The directive stated: These are the conditions that make each party member an active member closely connected with the masses.

    法共中央关于展开吸收新党员运动的指示
    【新华社讯】“新法兰西”周刊刊载了法国共产党中央政治局关于一九五五年展开吸收新党员运动的指示。指示说：“党在保卫和平、争取民族独立、争取满足劳动人民的要求方面不屈不挠的斗争在一九五四年取得了重大的胜利。党在全国的威望已经大大提高。”千百万城乡劳动者、先进的知识分子、其他爱国人士在一九五四年更加了解了共产党的决定作用，从而拥护党的政策。一九五五年吸收新党员的运动就是要把这些人中间成千上万最有觉悟的、最有认识的、最坚决的人吸收到党的队伍中来。
    指示着重指出，这个运动有着双重目的：一方面是吸收新党员，建立新支部（特别是在企业中），这样来加强党；另一方面是提高党和每个党员的政治水平。指示说：“党能够而且应当加强组织，从而更好地领导群众胜利地进行战斗，争取法国政策的完全改变……”
    政治局号召所有党组织坚持斗争，争取改进支部的政治活动，提高每个党员的思想水平。指示说：这些就是使得每个党员成为同群众密切联系的活动分子的条件。
