Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 26th: TASS reports: The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR issued a decree on the 25th regarding the cessation of the state of war between the Soviet Union and Germany. The decree states:

    On June 22, 1941, the Soviet Union entered a state of war with Germany due to the perfidious attack launched by Hitler's Germany. The Soviet people, together with the peoples of the anti-Hitler coalition countries, waged a selfless struggle, defeated the Hitlerite aggressors, and liberated the people of Europe—including the German people—from fascist enslavement. The Potsdam Conference in 1945 determined the path for Germany's further development as a unified, peace-loving, and democratic state and confirmed the necessity of concluding a peace treaty with Germany.

    Although about ten years have passed since the cessation of hostilities against Germany, Germany remains divided, no peace treaty has been concluded, and the German people remain in an unequal position compared to the peoples of other countries. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR considers such a phenomenon to be abnormal.

    The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR notes that the policy of the United States, Britain, and France, which aims to remilitarize West Germany and incorporate it into aggressive military blocs—a policy manifested in the London and Paris Agreements—makes it impossible to reach the necessary agreements on the issue of restoring German unity along peaceful and democratic lines and to conclude a peace treaty with Germany.

    In view of the consolidation and expansion of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, based on the principles of recognition of sovereignty and equality of rights, and taking into account the opinion of the government of the German Democratic Republic, and considering the interests of the people of East and West Germany, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR declares:

    1. The state of war between the Soviet Union and Germany shall be terminated, and peaceful relations between the two countries shall be established.

    2. All legal restrictions arising from the war on German citizens, who were regarded as citizens of an enemy state, shall be abolished.

    3. The declaration of the end of the state of war with Germany does not alter Germany's international obligations and does not affect the rights and obligations enjoyed and assumed by the Soviet Union under existing four-power international agreements regarding Germany as a whole.

    The decree was signed by K. Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and N. Pegov, Secretary of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.

    苏联最高苏维埃主席团发布命令
    结束苏德间的战争状态
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最高苏维埃主席团在二十五日发布关于结束苏联同德国之间的战争状态的命令。命令说：
    一九四一年六月二十二日，苏联由于希特勒德国发动背信弃义的进攻而同德国处于战争状态。苏联人民同反希特勒联盟的国家的人民一道进行了忘我的斗争，击溃了希特勒侵略者，把欧洲人民——包括德国人民在内——从法西斯的奴役下解放出来。一九四五年的波茨坦会议决定了德国进一步发展成为单一的、爱好和平的、民主的国家的途径，并且确认了缔结对德和约的必要性。
    虽然结束对德国的敌对行动到现在已经约莫有十年了，但是德国仍然处在分裂状态，没有缔结和约，而德国人民也仍然处在同其他国家人民不平等的地位。苏联最高苏维埃主席团认为这样的现象是不正常的。
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团注意到，美、英、法三国的目的在于使西德重新军国主义化和使它加入侵略性的军事集团的政策——这种政策表现在伦敦和巴黎协定中——使得不可能就按照和平和民主的方针恢复德国统一的问题达成必要的协议和缔结对德和约。
    鉴于苏联同德意志民主共和国之间的以承认主权和权利平等原则为基础的友好关系的巩固和扩展，同时考虑到德意志民主共和国政府的意见，考虑到东西德人民的利益，苏联最高苏维埃主席团宣布：
    一、苏联同德国之间的战争状态应当结束，两国之间的和平关系应当建立起来。
    二、由战争引起的、对于被当成敌国的公民看待的德国公民的一切法律限制，应当废除。
    三、宣布结束同德国的战争状态并不改变德国的国际义务，同时并不影响苏联根据现有的四国关于整个德国的国际协定而享有的权利和承担的义务。
    命令由苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席克·伏罗希洛夫和苏联最高苏维埃主席团秘书纳·别哥夫签署。
