Statement by the Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China on the US Instigation of France to Assist Chiang Kai-shek Bandits in Kidnapping and Transporting Overseas Chinese in Northern Vietnam
(Xinhua News Agency, January 19th) The Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued the following statement regarding the US instigation of the French authorities to assist the Chiang Kai-shek clique in kidnapping and transporting Overseas Chinese in northern Vietnam:

　　Since the Geneva Conference reached an agreement on restoring peace in Indochina, the United States, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and the French authorities have been systematically robbing and persecuting Overseas Chinese in areas such as Hanoi and Mong Cai, and openly dispatching airplanes and ships to kidnap and transport Overseas Chinese to Haiphong, Saigon, and Taiwan. The Overseas Chinese who were kidnapped and transported to Haiphong and Saigon suffered displacement, hunger, and disease, and some were subjected to torture and murder. The Overseas Chinese youths and students who were kidnapped and transported to Taiwan were forcibly incorporated into Chiang Kai-shek's army to serve as cannon fodder by the Chiang Kai-shek clique. This brutal crime by the United States has aroused the public indignation of the Chinese people and the vast number of Overseas Chinese abroad. The spokesperson of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of China condemned it on August 16, 1954. However, the criminal acts of the United States, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and the French authorities in kidnapping and transporting Overseas Chinese not only did not stop, but have recently intensified. US, French, and Chiang Kai-shek agents are now using all kinds of vicious methods in Haiphong, Quang Yen, Ba Wan, Huangbei, and other places to coerce Overseas Chinese to move south, intensifying their criminal activities of kidnapping and transporting Overseas Chinese.

　　The act of the United States instigating the French authorities to assist the Chiang Kai-shek clique in persecuting, plundering, and kidnapping Overseas Chinese completely violates Article 8 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference of July 21, 1954, which stipulates that "The provisions of the Agreements on the cessation of hostilities, intended to ensure the protection of individuals and of property must be most strictly applied, in particular to permit everyone in Viet-Nam to decide freely in which zone he wishes to live." The Chinese people cannot tolerate this deliberate act by the United States and the French authorities to undermine the Geneva Conference agreement on restoring peace in Indochina, and hereby warn the United States and the French authorities that they must immediately stop this crime, otherwise, the United States and the French authorities shall bear full responsibility for all consequences arising therefrom. January 19, 1955
(Xinhua News Agency, January 19th) After the Geneva Conference reached an agreement on restoring peace in Indochina, the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, with the open participation of the French authorities, kidnapped a large number of Overseas Chinese in northern Vietnam to southern Vietnam and Taiwan. As of early November 1954, according to preliminary statistics, more than 12,000 Overseas Chinese had been kidnapped by the US government and the Chiang Kai-shek clique using various ships and airplanes.

　　As early as the beginning of July 1954, the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique forced the Overseas Chinese primary and secondary schools in northern Vietnam to close early, and concentrated all Overseas Chinese students and teachers under surveillance before kidnapping them. On the 22nd of the same month, Chiang Kai-shek's agents, in collusion with Bao Dai's army, went around Mong Cai beating gongs and posting notices, coercing Overseas Chinese to withdraw with the French army along with local residents. Overseas Chinese who were unwilling to withdraw with the French army and Chiang Kai-shek's agents were charged with fabricated crimes, arrested, and forcibly kidnapped.

　　Chiang Kai-shek's agents colluded with the French army to escort Overseas Chinese kidnapped from various places to Kang Hai, Yue Shan, Gu Liu, Ken Ba, and Gong Men for concentration. The Overseas Chinese who were kidnapped to Kang Hai endured hardships in the open air, exposed to the sun and rain. In August 1954 alone, more than 30 kidnapped Overseas Chinese starved to death or died of illness in Kang Hai alone. In the same month, a large number of Overseas Chinese were driven onto two warships, children were trampled to death in the chaos, and crying women with illnesses were thrown into the sea and drowned. Thousands of Overseas Chinese who were kidnapped and transported to southern Vietnam are now displaced and wandering everywhere. Some Overseas Chinese who were forcibly taken away and escaped were shot on the spot after being caught. In Ken Ba, the French army beat an Overseas Chinese youth who was unwilling to follow them to withdraw to the south with a wooden stick until he fainted, then woke him up with water and beat him again, torturing him to death. After his death, his body was tied to a tree by the roadside for "public display." A group of Overseas Chinese youths and students who were kidnapped and transported to Taiwan were forced to join the Chiang Kai-shek army as cannon fodder.

　　Recently, Chiang Kai-shek's agents have intensified their activities of kidnapping Overseas Chinese in Haiphong, Quang Yen, Ba Wan, Huangbei, and other places. In late December 1954, ships supplied by the United States for kidnapping Overseas Chinese arrived in Haiphong again, kidnapping Overseas Chinese who were forced to concentrate. It is reported that on January 16, the US transport ship "General Howze" arrived in Saigon from Haiphong, with more than 3,200 kidnapped Overseas Chinese on board.

　　The criminal activities of the United States, Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and the French authorities in openly kidnapping Overseas Chinese in northern Vietnam to southern Vietnam and Taiwan have aroused the public indignation of the people in various parts of China and the vast number of Overseas Chinese abroad.

    就美国嗾使法国协助蒋贼劫运在越南北部的华侨事
    我国外交部发言人发表声明
　  【新华社十九日讯】中华人民共和国外交部发言人就美国嗾使法国当局协助蒋介石卖国集团劫运越南北部华侨事发表声明如下：
    自日内瓦会议达成恢复印度支那和平协议以后，美国、蒋介石卖国集团和法方当局便有计划地对河内、芒街等地华侨进行劫夺和迫害，并公然派遣飞机、船舰劫运华侨到海防、西贡和台湾。被劫运到海防、西贡去的华侨受尽了流离失所和饥饿、疾病的痛苦，有的并遭受毒刑和杀害；被劫运到台湾的华侨青年、学生，则被蒋介石卖国集团强迫编入蒋贼军队充当炮灰。美国的这一残暴罪行，引起了我国人民和国外广大华侨的公愤，我国华侨事务委员会发言人曾于一九五四年八月十六日加以斥责。但美国、蒋介石卖国集团和法方当局劫运华侨的罪恶行为不仅未停止，最近竟变本加厉。美、法和蒋介石特务现正在海防、广安、婆湾、荒碑等地，用尽各种毒辣手段，胁迫华侨南迁，加紧进行劫运华侨的罪恶活动。
    美国嗾使法方当局协助蒋介石卖国集团迫害、掠夺、劫运华侨的行为，完全违反一九五四年七月二十一日的日内瓦会议最后宣言第八项的规定，即：“停止敌对行动协定中关于保证维护生命财产的各项条款，必须最严格地予以执行，特别是必须使在越南的每一个人都能自由地选择他所愿意居住的地区”。中国人民对美国和法方当局这种蓄意破坏日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平协议的行为是不能容忍的，并正告美国和法方当局必须立即停止这种罪行，否则，由此所产生的一切后果，美国和法方当局应负完全责任。一九五五年一月十九日 　 【新华社十九日讯】日内瓦会议达成恢复印度支那和平协议以后，美国、蒋介石卖国集团，在法方当局的公开参与下，将越南北部的大批华侨劫运到越南南部和台湾。截至一九五四年十一月初旬止，据初步统计，被美国政府和蒋介石卖国集团用各式船舰、飞机劫走的华侨在一万二千人以上。
    美国和蒋介石卖国集团早在一九五四年七月初，就迫使越南北部的华侨中、小学校提前结业，把华侨学生和教师全部集中监管，然后劫走。同月二十二日，蒋贼特务同保大军队相勾结，在芒街一带四出打锣、贴布告，胁迫华侨同当地居民一道随法军撤退。不愿跟随法军和蒋贼特务撤走的华侨，便被加上虚构的罪名，横遭逮捕，强行劫走。
    蒋贼特务和法军勾结一起，把从各地劫走的华侨都押到康海、岳山、谷柳、肯吧、宫门集中。被劫到康海的华侨，风餐露宿，日晒雨淋，受尽苦难。在一九五四年八月，仅在康海一地，被劫持的华侨便有三十多个饿死病死。同月间曾有大批华侨被赶上两艘兵舰，孩子在混乱中被踩死，有病啼哭的妇女被扔入海中淹死。有数千被劫运到越南南部的华侨，现在流离失所，到处流浪。有些被强拉后逃走的华侨，被捉住之后就被就地枪杀。在肯吧，法军把一个不愿跟随他们向南撤退的华侨青年用木棒打昏后再用水淋醒，醒后又打，就这样一直折磨至死，死后尸首还被绑在路边树上“示众”。被劫运到台湾的一批华侨青年、学生，被强迫编入蒋贼军队充当炮灰。
    最近以来，蒋贼特务在海防、广安、婆湾、荒碑等地加紧其劫夺华侨的活动。一九五四年十二月下旬，由美国供应的劫运华侨的船只又驶抵海防，劫运被迫集中的华侨。据闻一月十六日，已有一艘美国运输舰“豪斯将军”号由海防驶抵西贡，其中被劫运抵西贡的华侨达三千二百余人以上。
    美国、蒋贼和法方当局公然劫运越南北部的华侨到越南南部和台湾的罪恶活动，已引起中国各地人民与国外广大华侨的公愤。
