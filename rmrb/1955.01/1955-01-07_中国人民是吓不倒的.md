Title: The Chinese People Cannot Be Intimidated

Among the handful of people defending the so-called "mutual defense treaty" signed for the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, Australian Foreign Minister Casey is one of the recent echoers.

Casey knows that history, law, and facts all affirm that Taiwan is Chinese territory. However, he avoids discussing these and, echoing the United States' overbearing tone, insists on behalf of his government that Taiwan should remain in the hands of "non-Communist countries."

In other words, Casey believes that Taiwan, Chinese territory, should remain in the hands of the United States. This is the most blatant statement to date by a responsible official of a foreign government, other than the United States, supporting the US occupation of Chinese territory.

Casey made this statement on December 31, 1954, while defending the US-Chiang treaty. He repeated the same old tune that many followers of the United States have sung many times, claiming that the US-Chiang treaty can provide "the possibility of avoiding war." This kind of fallacy sounds particularly hypocritical more than a month after the signing of the US-Chiang treaty. In the past month, the United States has conducted military exercises off the Chinese coast, actively deploying permanent military bases for land, sea, and air forces in Taiwan, and strengthening the US naval and air forces in the Taiwan Strait. A conspiracy to use the US-Chiang treaty to organize a so-called "Northeast Asia alliance" and a military aggression system in the Pacific region is underway under the planning of Radford. The United States has also stepped up military assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. Encouraged by the US-Chiang treaty, the latter is clamoring to "counterattack the mainland" and intensifying harassing warfare against the Chinese coast. All these facts prove that the United States created the US-Chiang treaty in preparation for war.

The United States uses the US-Chiang treaty to indefinitely occupy China's territory of Taiwan and Penghu, which is itself a serious act of aggression, but Casey still wants people to believe that the US-Chiang treaty "does not contain" the threat of aggression against China.

The US aggressor group and British Deputy Foreign Secretary Nutting once attempted to obstruct the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan by clamoring about the threat of war. Now Casey has joined in, shouting that "any attack" on Taiwan and Penghu "will be resisted." Casey probably thinks he can intimidate the Chinese people better than the US aggressor group and Nutting. In fact, this only exposes his hostility towards the Chinese people. Mr. Casey should know that the Chinese people's firm determination cannot be intimidated by anyone.

    中国人民是吓不倒的
    新华社评论员　江南
    在替美国和蒋介石卖国集团签订的所谓“共同防御条约”辩护的一小撮人中间，澳大利亚的外交部长凯西是最近以来帮腔的一个。
    凯西知道，历史、法律和事实都肯定台湾是中国的领土。但是，他躲开这些不讲，却学着美国的蛮横口气，代表他的政府硬说台湾应该留在
  “非共产党国家”手中。
    换句话说，凯西认为，中国的领土台湾应该留在美国手中。这是到现在为止除了美国以外的外国政府负责官员支持美国强占中国领土的言论中最露骨的一次。
    凯西是在一九五四年十二月三十一日替美蒋条约作辩护的时候说这句话的。他重复旁的追随美国的人唱过好多遍了的谰调，说什么美蒋条约能够提供“避免战争的可能性”。这种谰调在美蒋条约签订一个多月以后听来，特别显得虚伪。在过去一个多月中，美国在中国沿海进行军事演习，在台湾积极布置陆海空军的永久性军事基地，并且加强了台湾海峡中的美国海空军力量。利用美蒋条约来组织一个所谓“东北亚联盟”和太平洋地区的军事侵略体系的阴谋，正在雷德福的策划之下进行。美国还加紧了对蒋介石卖国集团的军事援助。后者在美蒋条约的鼓励之下，正在大肆叫嚣“反攻大陆”，加紧对中国沿海的骚扰性战争。这一切事实都证明美国制造美蒋条约是为了准备战争。
    美国用美蒋条约来无限期侵占中国的领土台湾和澎湖，这件事本身就是严重的侵略行为，可是凯西却还要人家相信什么美蒋条约“不包含”侵略中国的威胁。
    美国侵略集团和英国的外交副大臣纳丁曾企图用叫嚣战争的威胁来阻挠中国人民解放台湾。现在凯西也来帮腔，叫喊什么对台湾和澎湖的
  “任何攻击都将受到抵抗”。凯西大概以为他比较美国侵略集团和纳丁更能吓倒中国人民。其实这不过是暴露他对中国人民的敌视罢了。凯西先生应该知道，中国人民的坚定决心是谁也吓不倒的。
