China's Vegetable Oil Crops
Zhang Zhiyuan

Vegetable oil is an important source of edible oil for the Chinese people's daily needs and an important industrial raw material.

China produces many kinds of vegetable oil crops, mainly including peanuts, rapeseed, sesame, flaxseed (i.e., oil flaxseed), soybeans, cottonseed, sunflower, hemp seed, perilla (i.e., suzi), castor seed, as well as woody oil tea, walnuts, coconuts, oil palm, tung oil, tallow tree, etc. Among them, peanuts, rapeseed, sesame, flaxseed, and soybeans are the main edible oil crops for the Chinese people.

Peanuts are distributed in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River; Shandong Province alone accounts for about 30% of the total peanut planting area in the country. Rapeseed is mainly distributed in the Yangtze River Basin. Sesame is mainly distributed in the areas north and south of the Huai River. Flaxseed is mainly distributed in Inner Mongolia and the Northwest. Soybeans are planted everywhere, and the main producing area is in the Northeast.

Woody oil crops are basically planted in mountainous areas: Oil tea is mostly planted in the Yangtze River Basin and its southern regions. Walnuts are mostly produced in the northern provinces of China.

China's vegetable oil crops are world-renowned for their abundant output and excellent quality. For example, the output and quality of soybeans rank first in the world; peanut production is second only to India; rapeseed and sesame production also rank first. Other products such as oil tea, walnuts, and tung oil are important specialties of China.

In the five years since liberation, thanks to the government's active support for oil crop production, strengthened technical guidance, and appropriate adjustments to purchase prices, the production of vegetable oil crops has developed significantly. The sown area and output of the five major edible oil crops, including soybeans, peanuts, rapeseed, sesame, and flaxseed, have been increasing year by year. For example, taking the sown area and output of 1950 as 100, the sown area in 1951 was 119.5 and the output was 135.9; the sown area in 1953 was 135.1 and the output was 138.6. Although 1954 suffered from severe rain and flood disasters, the national output of major vegetable oil crops still exceeded the level of 1953, and the total output of the five major oil crops exceeded 5,980,000 dan compared to 1953. Oil tea in the south had a bumper harvest.

In terms of improving the cultivation techniques of oil crops and increasing the yield per unit area, various regions have also made considerable achievements. In 1954, the national soybean planting area using rhizobium inoculation reached 22.5 million mu, and the peanut planting area reached 2.26 million mu. Experience has proved that rhizobium inoculation can generally increase soybean production by 5% to 10% and peanut production by 10% to 15%. In recent years, the sown area of improved varieties of oil crops has also been gradually expanding. Sichuan's "Victory" rapeseed, the "Jiangmiao" rapeseed in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, Shandong's "Half-Creeping" peanut, Hebei's "Liyang Large-Grain" peanut, Yunnan's "Liyang Small-Grain" peanut, the "Mancangjin," "Zihua No. 4," and "Xiaojinmiao No. 1" soybeans in Northeast China, and the "Bawangbian" sesame in Henan and Hebei, and other excellent varieties, have all had significant effects on increasing production after being promoted in various regions. In addition, various regions have also summarized and promoted local experience in increasing production. Laiyang Prefecture in Shandong Province promoted the experience of deep plowing, deep digging, concentrated application of ditch fertilizer, and ridge-terrace planting of peanuts; Yanbei Prefecture in Shanxi Province promoted the experience of deep plowing, early sowing, and increasing the seeding rate of flaxseed; Sichuan promoted the experience of selecting improved varieties and applying fertilizer at the initial flowering stage of rapeseed, all of which have achieved good results. Many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams that have promoted advanced experience and improved cultivation techniques have increased the yield of oil crops by one to two times.

Further increasing oil production is one of the important tasks of China's agricultural production. Although oil production has been increasing year by year in recent years, it still cannot keep up with the growing demand. The former Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued the "Instructions on Mobilizing Farmers to Increase the Production of Oil Crops" in September last year, which stipulated the basic principles and methods for further developing the production of oil crops and solving the edible oil problem. The general requirement is: rural areas should achieve self-sufficiency in edible oil and ensure that more oil crops are sold to the state; for a small number of areas that cannot grow oil crops, the state commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives will provide appropriate supplies according to the local farmers' edible oil habits.

It is entirely possible to mobilize the vast number of farmers to increase the planting of oil crops. China has great potential in expanding the planting area of oil crops and increasing the yield per unit area. China's climate and soil are suitable for the growth of various oil crops, and there is also a considerable amount of arable land that does not compete with grain and cotton for land. For example, the south has about 80 million mu of winter fallow land that can be utilized. If combined with water conservancy construction and reasonable rotation with wheat and green manure, the rapeseed planting area can be expanded by 10 to 20 million mu. Various provinces also have a lot of sandy wasteland, river beaches, and hilly land that can be planted with peanuts. There are many alkaline wastelands along the coast suitable for planting sunflowers. In addition, advocating appropriate intercropping and mixed cropping with other crops can also increase the harvest of oil crops. Therefore, the state requires that in 1955 and 1956, the planting area of the four major oil crops, rapeseed, peanuts, sesame, and flaxseed, should increase by more than 30% compared to 1954. In addition, farmers can also make full use of gaps in fields, ridges, roadsides, ditches, houses, gardens, etc., to plant sunflowers, castor beans, sesame, and soybeans. In the vast mountainous areas, edible and industrial woody oil plants such as oil tea, walnuts, Chinese pepper, tung oil, and tallow trees can be developed according to local conditions; in tropical areas, woody oil plants such as coconuts, oil palm, and nutmeg can also be developed. Although these woody oil plants grow slowly, farmers should actively plant them from the perspective of long-term production increase. In mountainous areas, planting these crops will not affect grain and cotton production, but also increase income and improve living standards. According to the national plan, by 1957, in addition to all the barren oil tea mountains that should be reclaimed for production, the planting area of oil tea should be expanded by 50%, and the planting of walnuts and other woody oil crops should be actively increased.

Some farmers do not pay attention to the cultivation and management of oil crops, and the yield of oil is very low. If they can actively select improved varieties and strive to improve cultivation techniques, the yield of oil can be significantly increased. In 1953, the average yield of peanuts per mu in Guangdong Province was 112 jin. However, some farmers in Lufeng County in this province increased the average yield per mu to 400 jin by implementing deep plowing, meticulous cultivation, and careful seed selection. In 1954, the average yield of rapeseed per mu in Sichuan Province was 106 jin. Farmers who improved cultivation techniques and selected the "Victory" rapeseed variety achieved a yield of more than 300 jin per mu. The same is true for sesame, flaxseed, soybeans, etc. Therefore, various regions should actively summarize and promote local effective experience in increasing production, and effectively take measures such as promoting improved varieties, increasing fertilizer application, appropriately increasing the number of plants per unit area, and strengthening field management to ensure a large increase in the production of oil crops.

    我国的植物油料
    张止渊
    植物油料是我国人民日常所需食油的重要来源，也是重要的工业原料。
    我国出产的植物油料种类很多，主要的有花生、油菜籽、芝麻、胡麻籽（即油用亚麻籽）、大豆、棉籽、向日葵、大麻籽、荏（即苏子）、蓖麻籽，以及木本的油茶、核桃、椰子、油棕、油桐、乌桕等。其中花生、油菜籽、芝麻、胡麻籽和大豆，是我国人民的主要的食用油料。
    花生分布在黄河中下游；山东一省的花生种植面积即占全国花生种植总面积的百分之三十左右。油菜主要分布在长江流域。芝麻主要分布在淮河南北地区。胡麻主要分布在内蒙古和西北一带。大豆各地都有种植，主要产区在东北。
    木本油料基本上种植在山区：油茶多种植在长江流域及其以南地区。核桃以我国北部诸省产量较多。
    我国所产的植物油料以产量丰富和质量优良闻名世界。例如，大豆的产量、质量都居世界第一位；花生产量仅次于印度；油菜籽和芝麻的产量也占首位。其他如油茶、核桃、油桐等都是我国的重要特产。
    解放后五年以来，由于人民政府积极扶助油料生产，加强了技术指导，适当地调整了收购价格，植物油料的生产已有显著的发展。大豆、花生、油菜、芝麻和胡麻等五种主要食用油料作物的播种面积和产量都在逐年增加。如以一九五○年的播种面积和产量为一百，一九五一年的播种面积是一一九点五，产量是一三五点九；一九五三年的播种面积是一三五点一，产量是一三八点六。一九五四年虽然遭受到严重的雨涝灾害，但全国主要植物油料的产量仍然超过一九五三年的水平，五种主要油料作物的总产量超过一九五三年五百九十八万多担。南方的油茶普遍丰收。
    在改进油料作物的栽培技术、提高单位面积产量方面，各地也做出了不少成绩。一九五四年全国用根瘤菌拌种的大豆种植面积达到二、二五零万亩，花生种植面积达到二二六万亩。经验证明，用根瘤菌拌种一般可使大豆增产百分之五至十，花生增产百分之十至十五。几年来，油料作物的良种播种面积也在逐渐扩大。四川的“胜利”油菜，江苏、浙江一带的“姜苗”菜籽，山东的“半爬蔓”花生，河北的“立秧大粒种”花生，云南的“立秧小粒种”花生，东北地区的“满仓金”、“紫花四号”、“小金苗一号”大豆，河南、河北等地的“霸王鞭”芝麻等优良品种，经各地推广后，在增产上都有显著效果。另外，各地还总结和推广了当地的增产经验。山东莱阳专区推广了花生的深耕深刨、集中施沟肥和打垅台播种的经验；山西雁北专区推广了胡麻的深耕、早播、增加播种量的经验；四川推广了油菜的选用良种和初花施肥等经验，都收到了良好的效果。许多推广了先进经验和改进了栽培技术的农业生产合作社和互助组，油料作物产量都提高一倍到两倍。
    进一步增加油料生产，是我国农业生产的重要任务之一。几年来油料生产虽在逐年增加，但是，仍然赶不上日益增长的需要。原中央人民政府政务院曾在去年九月发出了“关于发动农民增加油料作物生产的指示”，规定了进一步发展油料作物生产和解决食油问题的基本方针和办法。总的要求是：农村做到食油自给，并保证有更多的油料卖给国家；对于少数确实不能种植油料作物的地区，则由国家商业部门和供销合作部门按当地农民食油的习惯予以适当供应。
    发动广大农民增植油料是完全可能的。我国在扩大油料作物种植面积和提高单位面积产量方面，都有很大的潜力。我国气候和土壤适于各种油料作物的生长，而且不与粮棉争地的耕地也不少。如南方约有可以利用的冬闲田八千万亩，如果结合兴修水利，并和小麦、绿肥实行合理轮作，就可以扩大一、二千万亩油菜种植面积。各省还有不少沙荒地、河滩和丘陵地可以种植花生。沿海地带有不少碱荒地适于种植向日葵。此外，提倡适当地和其他作物间作混作，也能增加油料作物的收获量。因此，国家要求在一九五五年和一九五六年两年内，油菜、花生、芝麻、胡麻四种主要油料作物种植面积，比一九五四年增加百分之三十以上。此外，农民们还可以充分利用田边、地埂、路旁、沟沿、宅园等隙地播种向日葵、蓖麻、芝麻和大豆等。在广大的山区，可因地制宜地发展食用的和工业用的木本油料植物，如油茶、核桃、花椒、油桐和乌桕等；在热带地区还可以发展椰子、油棕、香果等木本油料植物。这些木本油料植物虽然成长较慢，但从长期增产着眼，农民们应当积极种植。在山区，种植这些作物，既不影响粮棉生产，又可增加收入，改善生活。按照国家计划，到一九五七年，除荒芜的油茶山应全部垦复生产外，还要扩大油茶种植面积百分之五十，并积极增植核桃及其他木本油料。
    有些农民不注意油料作物的栽培管理，油料产量很低，如能积极选用良种，努力改进栽培技术，油料产量就可以显著提高。一九五三年广东省的花生平均每亩产量是一一二斤，但是，这个省的陆丰县的部分农民因实行深耕细作和认真选种，平均每亩产量提高到四百斤。一九五四年四川省的油菜平均每亩产量是一零六斤，改进了栽培技术和选用了“胜利”油菜良种的农民，每亩产量就达到三百斤以上。其他如芝麻、胡麻、大豆等，也都有同样情况。因此，各地应该积极总结和推广当地行之有效的增产经验，切实采取推广良种、增施肥料、适当增加单位面积株数、加强田间管理等措施，以保证油料作物的大量增产。
