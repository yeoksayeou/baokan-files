Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, January 5th: The American aggressive bloc is stepping up preparations to unilaterally arm West Germany.

According to Norris, a military observer for the "Washington Post" and "Times Herald," the US government has already stored complete combat equipment for six to seven divisions in the United States and Europe, "ready to be shipped to West Germany as soon as the Paris Accords are approved in Western countries." Norris said that the value of the military supplies prepared by the United States for the new West German "Defense Force" is estimated at about 1.5 billion US dollars.

According to the Vienna "Abendblatt," former US President Hoover, during his recent visit to Bonn, signed a secret agreement with West Germany on supplying West Germany with the latest weapons and providing loans to West Germany to purchase these weapons. The secret agreement stipulates that the "United Geophysical Corporation," controlled by Hoover, will supply West Germany with uranium ore. At the same time, the United States will undertake the obligation to supply West Germany with atomic boilers and atomic pile equipment, so that West Germany can immediately begin constructing atomic boilers and atomic piles after the Paris Accords are approved. In addition, the United States will provide West Germany with atomic weapons, including atomic bombs. US companies will supply West Germany with a large number of jet aircraft, including medium-sized bombers that can transport atomic bombs.
