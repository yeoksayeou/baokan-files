Do Not Act Based on Subjective Wishful Thinking

Every task undertaken by our Party and the People's Government aims to directly or indirectly benefit the people, for both their current and long-term interests. However, to ensure that each task achieves its intended effect and truly benefits the people, it is essential to proceed strictly from the actual situation and to have a correct set of working methods.

In our Party and state organs, some comrades, although with good intentions and a desire to do more beneficial things for the people, sometimes achieve the opposite effect and cause dissatisfaction among the people because of their subjective and one-sided thinking, incorrect working methods, and even some impure personal motives. The so-called "collective housing" incident in the Fifth District of Echeng County, Hubei Province, is a prime example. Last year, some areas in this district suffered from flooding, and many people's houses were destroyed. The county and district leaders decided to rebuild homes for the disaster victims. This was originally a good thing and should have been enthusiastically supported by the people. However, Liao Jingming, the secretary of the district Party committee, had serious subjective and grandiose ideas, hoping to showcase his achievements through this matter. Instead of going deep into the masses to listen to their opinions on building houses, and then formulating a practical and feasible work plan based on the Party and state policies and the actual situation at the time and place, he subjectively and arbitrarily came up with a so-called "collective housing" construction plan. The style and specifications of the houses were all preconceived by him, and the people had to resolutely implement them. According to his thinking, building so-called "collective housing" would not only overcome difficulties in materials and manpower, but also represent a step towards the "socialist road." In the future, "leaders from the province or the central government" would praise him when they saw these houses. That is to say, building collective housing was both beneficial to the people and personally advantageous to him. Therefore, he firmly believed in this subjective housing construction plan. Although comrades below repeatedly raised different opinions, he rejected them all with excuses such as "the masses need to be persuaded and educated," and hurriedly sent cadres to convene mass meetings in Luzhou Township overnight, mobilizing the masses to build the "collective housing" within three days, so as to promote it as a model throughout the district. However, the reality was completely opposite to the subjective ideas. When the district and township cadres announced the so-called "collective housing" construction plan in public, the masses did not respond with warm applause, but immediately erupted in opposition.

In our Party and government grassroots organizations, and even in some leadership organs above the county level, such examples of subjectivism are not isolated cases. If we want to do things for the people, we not only need to formulate work plans based on reality, but also need to have correct working methods when implementing the plans, which is the working method of the mass line. This means extensively and deeply conducting propaganda and education among the masses, truly making them understand the benefits of completing the work tasks for the country and the people, and thus willing to strive for its realization. Only by doing a good job in this propaganda and education work and mobilizing the masses can the work tasks be smoothly completed; otherwise, even if the work directly benefits the masses and the work plan is correct, it is still easy to spoil good things and cause dissatisfaction among the masses. Comrade Liu Shaoqi instructed us long ago in his book "On the Party": "All the undertakings of us Communists are the undertakings of the masses of the people. All our programs and policies, no matter how correct, cannot be realized without the direct support and persistent struggle of the broad masses. Therefore, everything we do depends on and is determined by the consciousness and initiative of the masses of the people. Without relying on the consciousness and initiative of the masses, we will accomplish nothing and waste our efforts." In 1953, the Party Central Committee launched a nationwide struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, giving a heavy blow to the bureaucratic practices in the leadership organs and the coercive command style of the grassroots cadres, but the coercive command style has not been completely eliminated. Since last year, whether in flood prevention and disaster relief and material supply work, in the unified purchase of grain, cotton, and oil crops, or in the development and consolidation of agricultural producers' cooperatives, some cadres have not patiently conducted propaganda and education among the masses, enlightening them to complete tasks on a conscious and voluntary basis, but have treated the masses with a simplistic and rude attitude. Especially when their work plans are divorced from reality and fail to gain the support of the masses, they will take extremely bad methods to deal with the masses. The "collective housing" incident occurred largely because the cadres in this district committed the error of coercive command. The leaders of this district not only subjectively formulated an unrealistic housing construction plan, but also did not think that this plan should be submitted to the masses for discussion to test whether the plan was feasible. They did not even think that things for the benefit of the masses should also be completed on the basis of the masses' conscious and voluntary action, but hastily set a deadline of three days to build the houses. When the masses raised objections, the district and township cadres in charge of leading the housing construction did not truthfully report the situation to their superiors, but instead intimidated the masses and ordered them to act immediately. Although many "collective houses" were built under their coercion, many people were unwilling to live in them because they were all the same size and format, which did not meet the various needs of the masses, and because cooking and fetching water were inconvenient. As a result, the people's wood and labor were wasted, state property was squandered, and some still useful houses were also demolished.

From this "collective housing" incident, it can also be seen that the reason why grassroots cadres have the problems of subjectivism and coercive command in their work is often inseparable from the bureaucracy of the leadership organs above the county level. The leadership cadres of Echeng County knew about this so-called "collective housing" construction plan, and it stands to reason that this wrong action should have been resolutely stopped by them. But the fact is not so. This subjective plan was put forward at the district committee work group leader cadre meeting convened by the Echeng County Party Committee, and some people opposed it, but it did not attract attention; the secretary of the county Party committee also knew about it, but did not stop the implementation of this plan, only preventing the organization of representatives from other districts to visit; while the deputy secretary of the county Party committee and the county magistrate praised this plan as "doing the right thing" and encouraged him to "go ahead and do it!" It should be pointed out that it is precisely this irresponsible and bad bureaucratic style towards the masses of the people that makes those with subjectivist and grandiose ideas more daring, and makes them dare to treat the masses with coercive command methods.

Although we have gone through the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, many leadership organs and leading cadres still have serious bureaucratic leadership styles. They are only obsessed with assigning tasks to lower levels, asking for statistical figures and percentages, and are only satisfied with what new plans and new methods are put forward by lower levels, thinking that the world is truly peaceful and everything is going smoothly. They do not conduct in-depth inspections and specific assistance to the work of lower levels, do not lead and supervise the work of lower levels on policies and principle issues, do not go deep into the masses, listen to the opinions of the masses at any time, and therefore cannot examine the success or failure of the work from the working methods and actual effects. They like to sit in the office and issue orders, put too much work on the shoulders of grassroots cadres, do not explain the policy boundaries, and do not explain the working methods. There is also a lack of necessary assistance, supervision and inspection afterwards. Even if there is supervision and inspection, it is not very in-depth; when problems are discovered, they find various reasons to forgive the cadres, and do not make timely handling. In the development of agricultural producers' cooperatives, some county Party committees have only proceeded from subjective wishes and repeatedly added tasks for building cooperatives to the lower levels. In addition to fueling the blind optimism of cadres and fueling the bad ideas and bad styles of a few cadres, the most important thing is that the bureaucratic work style of the leadership organs makes cadres feel that the tasks are too heavy and the time is too tight, forcing them to adopt coercive command methods to complete the tasks.

Therefore, in order to eliminate the coercive command and other unrealistic and bad ideological styles of grassroots cadres in the future, in addition to strengthening the political and ideological education of cadres and continuously improving their ideological awareness and policy level, the most urgent thing at present is to change the bureaucratic style of leadership organs. It should be known that the vast majority of our rural grassroots cadres are activists from the masses. After being tempered by various practical struggles, they generally have the excellent quality of serving the people, and they also have a high prestige among the masses. However, because their cultural level is generally relatively low and their policy and ideological level is not high, if we do not give them specific help and guidance, they will not be able to understand the Party's policies and guidelines well, and they will make mistakes in their work, such as being impatient and rash, or passively waiting, and it is also very easy to be infected with the style of the reactionary ruling class in dealing with the people. Therefore, when leadership organs above the county level assign tasks to lower levels, in addition to trying their best to ensure that the resolutions, instructions or work plans they issue are in line with the actual situation, they must properly arrange work tasks for cadres. Explain to them the benefits of completing the tasks for the country and the people; they must explain to them the policy boundaries and working methods, and promptly promote advanced working experience; they must go deep down, give them more specific help, and check their completion of the tasks, and give them regular and specific guidance.

### 不能凭主观愿望办事

    不能凭主观愿望办事
    我们党和人民政府进行的每一项工作，目的都是在于直接或间接地为人民谋福利，都是为了人民当前的和长远的利益。但是，要使每一项工作收到预期的效果，真正造福于人民，就必须严格地从实际情况出发，并且必须有一套正确的工作方法。
    在我们党和国家机关中，有些同志的主观愿望虽然很好，愿意为人民群众多作一些有益的事情；但是由于他们的思想主观片面，工作方法不对头，有时还夹杂着一些个人的不纯动机，结果把好事办坏了，反而引起人民群众的不满。湖北省鄂城县五区发生的所谓“集体房屋”事件，就是一个最明显的例子。去年这个区的部分地方遭了水灾，不少群众的房屋毁坏了，县、区领导上决定为灾民重建家园。这本来是一件好事，按理一定会得到群众的热诚拥护的。但是，这个区的区委书记廖镜明有严重的主观主义和好大喜功的思想，希望通过这件事来表现他的功绩。他不是深入到群众中去听取他们对于盖房的意见，然后再根据党和国家的政策，根据当时当地的实际情况，订出一个切实可行的工作计划。他主观武断地想出了一个所谓“集体房屋”建筑计划，房屋的样式和规格都是他事先想好的，群众必须坚决执行。按照他的想法，建筑所谓“集体房屋”，不但可以克服材料和人力上的困难，而且是走“社会主义道路”，将来“从省里或中央来的首长”看见这些房屋也会称赞他。这就是说，修建集体房屋既对群众有益，也对个人有利。因此，他对这个主观主义的盖房计划深信不疑，虽然下面的同志两次三番地提出不同意见，他都以“群众是要说服教育的”等为借口，一概拒绝加以考虑，并且急急忙忙地派出干部，要他们连夜赶到芦洲乡召开群众大会，动员群众在三天之内把“集体房屋”盖好，以便作为典型在全区推广。但是，事实是和主观主义者的想法完全相反的。当区乡干部当众宣布所谓“集体房屋”建筑计划以后，群众不是报以热烈的掌声，而是立即轰动了起来，提出了反对的意见。
    在我们的党政基层组织甚至一些县级以上的领导机关中间，这种主观主义的事例并不是个别的。我们要为人民群众办事，不仅需要从实际出发制订工作计划，而且在订出了计划加以实行的时候，还需要有正确的工作方法，就是群众路线的工作方法。这就是要广泛深入地向群众进行宣传教育，真正使群众懂得完成工作任务对国家和对人民的好处，从而愿意为它的实现而努力。只有作好这种宣传教育工作，把群众发动起来了，工作任务才能顺利地完成；否则即使这个工作直接有利于群众，工作计划也是正确的，同样容易把好事办坏，引起群众的不满。刘少奇同志在“论党”一书中早就指示我们：“我们共产党人的一切事业，都是人民群众的事业，我们的一切纲领与政策，不论是怎样正确，如果没有广大群众的直接的拥护和坚持到底的斗争都是无法实现的。所以，我们的一切，都依靠于、决定于人民群众的自觉与自动，不依靠于群众的自觉与自动，我们将一事无成，费力不讨好。”一九五三年党中央曾经在全国范围内发起了反对官僚主义、反对命令主义和反对违法乱纪的斗争，给了领导机关中的官僚主义和基层干部中的强迫命令作风以沉重的打击，但是强迫命令作风并没有完全肃清。自从去年以来，不论是在防汛救灾和物资供应工作中，在粮食、棉花和油料作物的统购工作中，或者是在发展和巩固农业生产合作社工作中，都有部分干部不是耐心地向群众进行宣传教育，启发群众在自觉自愿的基础上完成任务，而是用简单化的粗暴的态度对待群众。特别是在他们的工作计划脱离实际、得不到群众拥护的时候，他们更会采取极其恶劣的办法对待群众。“集体房屋”事件之所以发生，在很大程度上就是由于这个区的干部犯了强迫命令的错误。这个区的领导人不只是主观主义地订出了脱离实际的盖房计划，而且他也没有想到应该把这个计划交给群众讨论，考验一下这一计划是否切实可行，他更没有想到为群众谋福利的事，也应该在群众自觉自愿的基础上去完成，而是急躁地限定要在三天之内把房子盖好。当群众提出反对意见的时候，负责领导盖房工作的区乡干部，也不是把情况具实报告他们的上级，而是恐吓群众，命令群众立即行动。虽然在他们的强迫之下，“集体房屋”盖成不少；但是由于大小格式一样，不适合群众的各种要求，加上做饭吃水不方便等原因，很多群众不愿住。结果是浪费了群众的木料和人工，糟蹋了国家的财产，并且把一些还有用的房子也拆掉了。
    从这个“集体房屋”事件中还可以看出，基层干部所以在工作中发生主观主义和强迫命令的毛病，往往是和县级以上领导机关的官僚主义密切不可分的。这个所谓“集体房屋”建筑计划，鄂城县的领导干部是知道的，按理说这个错误的行动应该被他们坚决制止。但是事实不是如此，这个主观主义的计划，在鄂城县县委召开的区委工作组长干部会上提出过，而且有人反对过，并没有引起注意；县委书记也是知道的，也没有制止这一计划的执行，只是阻止过组织别区的代表去参观；而县委副书记和县长却对这一计划称赞为“做得对头”，鼓励他“好，干吧！”应该指出，正是这种对人民群众不负责任的恶劣的官僚主义作风，就使得那些有主观主义和好大喜功思想的人胆量更壮，使得他们敢于用强迫命令的方法来对待群众。
    虽然，我们经过了反官僚主义反命令主义和反违法乱纪的斗争，但是，不少领导机关和领导干部仍然存在着严重的官僚主义的领导作风。他们只醉心于向下级分配任务、要统计数字和百分比，只满足于下级提出来的什么新计划和新办法，就以为真正天下太平万事亨通。他们对下级的工作不作深入的检查和具体的帮助，不在政策上和原则问题上领导和监督下级的工作，不深入群众、随时倾听群众的意见，因而不能从工作方法和实际效果上去考察工作的成败。他们喜欢坐在办公室里发号施令，把过多的工作压在基层干部身上，不交代政策界限，也不交代工作方法，事后也缺乏必要的帮助、督促和检查。即使有督促、检查，但是很不深入；发现了问题，又想出各种理由来原谅干部，不作及时的处理。在发展农业生产合作社中，有的县委就只从主观愿望出发，一再地给下面追加建社的任务。领导机关的这种官僚主义的工作作风，除助长了干部的盲目乐观情绪，助长了少数干部的坏思想坏作风以外，最主要的是使干部感觉任务太重，时间又紧迫，迫着他们采用强迫命令的方法去完成任务。
    因此，要在今后肃清基层干部中的强迫命令及其他脱离实际的不良思想作风，除了应该从加强对干部的政治思想教育入手，不断地提高他们的思想觉悟和政策水平以外，当前最迫切的是必须转变领导机关中的官僚主义作风。要知道，我们的农村基层干部，绝大多数都是来自群众中的积极分子，经过各种实际斗争的锻炼，一般都具有为人民群众服务的优良品质，在群众中间也有较高的威信。但是由于他们的文化水平一般都比较低，政策思想水平不高，如果我们不给予他们具体的帮助和指导，他们就不能很好地领会党的政策方针，就会在工作中犯急躁冒进或者消极等待等错误，而且极易染上反动统治阶级对待人民的作风。因此，县级以上的领导机关在向下布置任务时，除应尽量作到使自己发布的决议、指示或工作计划符合实际情况以外，必须妥善地为干部安排工作任务。向他们说明完成任务对国家和人民的好处；必须向他们交代政策界限和工作方法，及时推广先进的工作经验；必须深入下去，多给他们具体的帮助，并且检查他们完成任务的情况，给他们以经常的具体指导。
