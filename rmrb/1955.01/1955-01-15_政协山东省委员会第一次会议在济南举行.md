The meeting heard the report delivered by Fan Yuzui, a member of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC, on the declaration, resolutions, and the Constitution of the CPPCC adopted at the First Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC; the work report of the former Vice-Chairman of the Shandong Provincial People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee, Ma Baosan; and the report on the current situation and tasks by Shu Tong, First Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

The meeting held group discussions and plenary speeches on the above reports. Forty-two people, including Chao Zhefu, Wang Shenlin, Li Chengzhi, Mi Changmao, and Zhang Ruqi, spoke at the meeting. They unanimously expressed their firm support for the declaration, resolutions, and Constitution of the CPPCC adopted at the First Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC. They unanimously agreed with the work report of the Shandong Provincial People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee delivered by Vice-Chairman Ma Baosan, and supported Shu Tong's report on the current situation and tasks. In their speeches, they angrily denounced the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" signed by the United States government and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and expressed their firm support for Foreign Minister Zhou's "Statement on the US-Chiang 'Mutual Defense Treaty'," stating that they would continue to follow the seven guidelines stipulated in the General Program of the CPPCC Constitution under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, assist the People's Government in mobilizing and uniting the people of the province, and work together to complete the tasks assigned to the province by the state, and strive for the liberation of Taiwan and the great socialist construction and socialist transformation of the motherland.

Finally, the meeting elected Tan Qilong as Chairman of the First Shandong Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, and Chao Zhefu, Ma Baosan, Miao Hainan, Wang Shenlin, and Zhang Boqiu as Vice-Chairmen by secret ballot. (Xinhua News Agency)
