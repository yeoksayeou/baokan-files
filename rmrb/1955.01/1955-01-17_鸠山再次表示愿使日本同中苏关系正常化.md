Xinhua News Agency, January 16th, TASS dispatch on January 15th: It can be seen from the news broadcast by Japanese radio stations that some people in Japan believe that the words spoken by Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama on January 11th were a kind of "competitive tactic." Hatoyama said that the Japanese government is prepared to "take the initiative in establishing normal relations with the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China."

On January 12th, Hatoyama commented on this interpretation of his words. He reiterated that Japan "should normalize its relations with the Soviet Union and China as soon as possible." He said that he "sees no difficulty in implementing Japan's foreign policy on this basis in the future" because restoring relations with neighboring countries is the "common aspiration of all Japanese political parties."

According to the Japanese "Asahi Shimbun," on January 13th, Prime Minister Hatoyama held a press conference in Yamaguchi Prefecture, where he once again expressed his advocacy for normalizing Japan's relations with China and the Soviet Union.

In explaining his views, Hatoyama said, "We will gradually approach the restoration of diplomatic relations, starting with measures such as sending economic missions to China and the Soviet Union, guaranteeing freedom of movement, and removing restrictions on commodity exports."

The newspaper also reported that Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu said at a press conference on January 12th that Prime Minister Hatoyama's views on the issue of Japan's relations with China and the Soviet Union, as expressed on January 11th, "do not contradict the foreign policy statement issued immediately after the formation of the current government."

    鸠山再次表示愿使日本同中苏关系正常化
   【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社十五日讯：从日本电台广播的消息中可以看出，日本某些人士认为，一月十一日日本首相鸠山一郎所说的话是一种“竞选手腕”，鸠山说，日本政府准备“在同苏联和中华人民共和国建立正常关系这件事中采取主动”。
    一月十二日，鸠山对于把他这段话作这样的解释一事发表意见，他又重复说，日本“应尽速地使自己同苏联和中国的关系正常化”。他说，他“看不出将来在这个基础上实行日本外交政策会有什么困难”，因为和各邻国恢复关系是“日本各个政党的共同愿望”。
    据日本“朝日新闻”报道，一月十三日，首相鸠山在山口县举行了记者招待会，他再一次表示主张使日本同中国和苏联的关系正常化。
    鸠山在解释自己的意见时说，“我们将逐步接近恢复外交关系：首先从派遣经济使团到中国和苏联、保证来往自由和取消商品出口的禁令等措施开始。”
    这家报纸还报道，日本外务相重光葵一月十二日在记者招待会上也说，首相鸠山一月十一日就日本同中国和苏联的关系问题所提出的观点“并不违背现任政府在它组成后所立即发表的外交政策声明”。
