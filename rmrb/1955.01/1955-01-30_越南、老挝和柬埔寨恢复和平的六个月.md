Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 29th: It has been six months since peace was restored in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. On July 27, 1954, seven days after the signing of the Geneva armistice agreements, all hostilities ceased on the North Vietnamese battlefield. Subsequently, ceasefire orders were implemented in Central and South Vietnam, as well as in Laos and Cambodia.

In South Vietnam, the Vietnamese People's Army withdrew in two phases. On October 7, 1954 (three days ahead of schedule), it withdrew from the Tra Vinh - Ham Tan temporary regroupment zone, and on October 30th, it withdrew from the Dong Thap Muoi Plain. During the same period, the Vietnamese People's Army in Interzone 5 of Central and South Vietnam transferred two units from the border of Quang Nam province to the Tra Khuc River in Quang Ngai province. Despite a lack of transportation and numerous difficulties caused by the climate, the transfer was completed ahead of schedule thanks to the efforts of the Vietnamese People's Army soldiers, the assistance of the residents, and the help of three Soviet and Polish ships.

In North Vietnam, the Vietnamese People's Army has taken over twelve cities, including the capital Hanoi and Hai Duong city.

The Vietnamese People's Volunteer Army completely withdrew from Cambodia on October 18, 1954, two days ahead of schedule; and on November 16th, three days ahead of schedule, it also completely withdrew from Laos. By November 20, 1954, the Lao Fighting Units had, in accordance with the Lao armistice agreement, all transferred to Phongsaly and Sam Neua provinces.

The six months of implementing the Geneva armistice agreements have proven that the Vietnamese People's Army, the Khmer Resistance Forces, and the Lao Fighting Units have made remarkable efforts in correctly implementing the Geneva armistice agreements and restoring and consolidating peace in Indochina.

As for the other side, although it has also made some efforts, many regrettable incidents have occurred.

The American imperialists are inducing French colonialists and their lackeys to oppose the implementation of the Geneva armistice agreements and are attempting to turn South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos into American war bases. The American imperialists established the aggressive Manila military bloc, dispatched Collins to South Vietnam, provided direct assistance to the Ngo Dinh Diem government, and are now directly training Bao Dai's troops. American warmongers are increasingly blatantly interfering in the affairs of South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.

The Ngo Dinh Diem government is implementing the American imperialists' policy of undermining the Geneva armistice agreements and, with the connivance of the French Union Forces authorities, is taking retaliatory measures against those who participated in the patriotic war, and suppressing those who support the Geneva armistice agreements and advocate for unification and democracy.

The Ngo Dinh Diem clique massacred people in Me Tri and Binh Thanh in South Vietnam, Ngan Son and Chi Thanh in Interzone 5 of Central and South Vietnam, and Kim Doi in Thua Thien province. They believe that they can consolidate their corrupt regime by using terror and suppression. But they have consistently met with resistance from all strata of the Vietnamese people, from south to north. The "Oppose American Imperialist Interference" movement and the movement against suppression and terror are expanding and deepening among the broad masses of the people.

Currently, the imperialists, led by American warmongers, are preparing to take further measures to undermine peace in the world and Southeast Asia and Indochina. Within two weeks, the Vietnamese People's Army will complete the transfer of troops from the Ca Mau Peninsula temporary regroupment zone to North Vietnam; in less than four months, the Vietnamese People's Army will completely withdraw its troops from Interzone 5, and the other side will also withdraw from the Haiphong area, thereby completing the military regroupment work of both sides. The Vietnamese people are preparing to hold meetings between the two sides to discuss the unification of the country through free general elections. The tasks of the Vietnamese people are significant in implementing the Geneva armistice agreements and consolidating peace. The Vietnamese people are determined to earnestly implement the Geneva agreements and urge the other side to do the same. They are determined to smash all conspiracies of the American imperialists and their lackeys to undermine the peace, unification, independence, and democracy of Vietnam.

    越南、老挝和柬埔寨恢复和平的六个月
    【新华社二十九日讯】　据越南通讯社河内二十七日讯：在越南、老挝和柬埔寨恢复和平已经有六个月了。一九五四年七月二十七日，即日内瓦停战协定缔结以后的七天，北越战场上的一切战事都停止了。此后，停火命令又相继在中越、南越和老挝、柬埔寨实行。
    在南越、越南人民军分两期撤退，一九五四年十月七日（比限期早三天）撤出了川木—咸津临时驻扎地段，十月三十日又撤出同塔梅平原。在同一时期内，中越南部第五联区的越南人民军把两支军队从广南省的边境转移到广义省的票河。尽管缺乏运输工具和气候所引起的许多困难，但是由于越南人民军战士的努力和居民的帮助以及三艘苏联和波兰船只的协助，部队的转移工作得按计划提前完成。
    在北越，越南人民军已接收了十二座城市，其中包括首都河内和海阳市。
    越南人民志愿部队在一九五四年十月十八日，即在限期以前两天，完全撤出柬埔寨；在十一月十六日，即在限期以前三天，又完全撤出老挝。到一九五四年十一月二十日止，寮国战斗部队按照老挝停战协定，全部转移到丰沙里和桑怒两省。
    履行日内瓦停战协定的六个月已经证明：越南人民军、高棉抗战部队和寮国战斗部队在正确履行日内瓦停战协定和恢复与巩固印度支那和平方面作了显著的努力。
    至于对方，虽然它也作了一些努力，但是发生了许多令人遗憾的事件。
    美帝国主义者诱使法国殖民主义分子和他们的走狗反对履行日内瓦停战协定，并企图把南越、柬埔寨和老挝变为美国的战争基地。美帝国主义者成立了侵略性的马尼拉军事集团，派遣柯林斯到南越，给予吴庭艳政府以直接援助，现在又正在直接训练保大的军队。美国战争贩子正在越来越露骨地干涉南越、老挝和柬埔寨的事务。
    吴庭艳政府执行美帝国主义者破坏日内瓦停战协定的政策，并且在法兰西联邦部队当局的纵容下，对那些曾参加爱国战争的人采取报复措施，镇压那些支持日内瓦停战协定和主张统一和民主的人。
    吴庭艳集团在南越的楳棋、平成，中越南部的银山、志成和承天省的金玳等地屠杀人民。他们以为用恐怖和镇压就可以巩固他们的腐朽的政权。但是他们始终遭到了从南到北的各阶层越南人民的反抗。“反对美帝国主义干涉”的运动和反对镇压和恐怖的运动，正在广大的人民群众中间扩大和深入。
    目前，以美国战争贩子为首的帝国主义者正准备采取进一步措施来破坏世界和东南亚以及印度支那的和平。在两星期之内，越南人民军就将完成把军队从金瓯角的临时驻扎地段转移到北越的工作；不到四个月，越南人民军就将全部把它的军队撤出第五联区，而对方也将撤出海防地区，从而完成双方的军事集结工作。越南人民正在准备举行双方的会议，以便讨论通过自由普选来统一国家的问题。在执行日内瓦停战协定和巩固和平的工作中，越南人民的任务是重大的。越南人民决心认真地履行日内瓦协定，并且敦促对方也这样做。他们决心粉碎美帝国主义者和他们的走狗们破坏越南的和平、统一、独立和民主的一切阴谋。
