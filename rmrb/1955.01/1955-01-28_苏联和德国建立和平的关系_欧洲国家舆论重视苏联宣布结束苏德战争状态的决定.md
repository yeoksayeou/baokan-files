    The Soviet Union and Germany Establish Peaceful Relations
    --European Public Opinion Attaches Importance to the Soviet Union's Decision to End the State of War with Germany
    [Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 27th] According to a TASS report from Berlin on the 26th: German democratic newspapers published the full text of the decree issued by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on the 25th regarding the end of the state of war between the Soviet Union and Germany under large headlines and in a prominent position.
    Radio stations in the German Democratic Republic broadcast the full text of the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union several times.
    The decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union became the focus of attention for West German newspapers on the 26th. Newspapers such as "Telegraf," "Neue Zeitung," "Die Tagespost," and "Spandauer Volksblatt" published the Soviet decision in a prominent position.
    "Telegraf" commented on the decree, saying that this action was a natural development following Moscow's proposal on January 15th to establish normal relations with West Germany. The newspaper then wrote: Moscow's new step involves questions that should be urgently explained. These questions can only be clarified through negotiations.
    "Die Tagespost" wrote in an editorial: Moscow's statement, as an action to legally end the state of war between the Soviet Union and Germany under international law, should be welcomed. In this regard, the Soviet statement has aroused approval and friendly understanding in Germany. At the same time, this newspaper attempted to cast doubt on the sincerity of the Soviet decision. The newspaper called for an end to the "Cold War," but did not mention a word about the fact that Western countries should be held responsible for this "Cold War" policy and the deepening of Germany's division.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 27th] The decree issued by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union regarding the end of the state of war between the Soviet Union and Germany has been given great importance by newspapers in European countries.
    Newspapers in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria all published the news of the decree in prominent positions and under large headlines. The headline in Czechoslovakia's "Rude Pravo" was "The Soviet Union and Germany Establish Peaceful Relations." "Lidova Demokracie" emphasized in its headline that "The State of War Between the Soviet Union and Germany Has Ended."
    British local newspapers paid close attention to the decree. All newspapers, except for the "Birmingham Post," published detailed news about the decree in prominent positions under large headlines. In commenting on the Soviet decision, diplomatic commentators in several London newspapers attempted to portray the resolution as if it "barely changed the actual relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union."
    Paris newspapers published the decree in a major position, and most newspapers also published the full text of the decree. French public opinion attaches great importance to this decision, although right-wing newspapers have tried to portray the matter as if this Soviet decision was already three years "late" compared to Western countries.
    Italian political figures and the press have warmly commented on the Soviet decision. "L'Unità" believes that this decision is "another important peaceful step by the Soviet Union." The bourgeois newspaper "Corriere della Sera" reported from Bonn that the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union was widely welcomed by people from all walks of life in West Germany, and that Adenauer's policies had aroused strong opposition and dissatisfaction among the people.
    Swedish newspapers reported the news about the Soviet decision in a prominent position. "Svenska Dagbladet" commented that the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union "cannot fail to have an impact on public opinion in West Germany."
    "Dagens Nyheter" pointed out in its commentary that the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union proved that "Moscow is trying to normalize its relations with West Germany."
    Danish "Politiken" political commentator Skov pointed out: The German people are increasingly resisting militarized policies. The Soviet Union's decision to end the state of war with Germany "may make it more difficult to continue implementing militarized policies due to the emotions it has aroused in Germany."
    Yugoslavia's "Borba" published a summary of the decree on the first page under the headline: "The Soviet Union Decides to End the State of War with Germany." "Politika" added the following headline to the news: "The Soviet Union Ends the State of War with Germany and Hopes to Establish Normal Relations with Germany."

    苏联和德国建立和平的关系
    ——欧洲国家舆论重视苏联宣布结束苏德战争状态的决定
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十六日讯：德国民主报纸以大字标题和头栏地位全文刊载苏联最高苏维埃主席团二十五日发布的关于结束苏德之间战争状态的命令。
    德意志民主共和国的电台连续数次广播苏联最高苏维埃主席团的命令全文。
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团的命令成为二十六日西德报纸的注意中心。“电讯报”、“新报”、“日报”、“斯班都人民报”等报纸以头栏地位刊载了苏联的这一决定。
    “电讯报”就这一命令发表评论说，这个行动是莫斯科从一月十五日建议同西德建立正常关系后的必然的发展。这家报纸接着写道：莫斯科的新步骤涉及到应该迫切予以解释的问题。这些问题只有通过谈判才能获得解释。
    “日报”在社论中写道：莫斯科的声明作为一个从国际法上结束苏德之间战争状态的行动，应当予以欢迎。在这方面，苏联的声明在德国引起了赞同和友好的谅解。这家报纸同时企图对苏联决定的诚意散布怀疑。这家报纸要求停止“冷战状态”，但是却一个字也没有提到，是西方国家应当对这种“冷战”政策和德国分裂的加深负责。
    【新华社二十七日讯】苏联最高苏维埃主席团发布的关于结束苏联同德国之间的战争状态的命令受到欧洲国家报纸的极大重视。
    波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚和保加利亚的报纸都以显著地位和大字标题登载了这项命令的消息。捷克斯洛伐克的“红色权利报”的标题是“苏联和德国建立和平的关系”。“人民民主报”在标题中强调说，“苏联同德国之间的战争状态结束了”。
    英国地方报纸非常注意这个命令。所有的报纸，除去“伯明翰邮报”以外，都以大字标题在显著地位刊载了关于这个命令的详细消息。伦敦好些报纸的外交评论员在评论苏联的决定时，企图把这个决议说成好像“几乎丝毫没有改变德国和苏联之间的实际关系”。
    巴黎的报纸以主要地位刊载了这一命令，大多数报纸并且刊载了这一项命令的全文。法国的社会舆论十分重视这个决定，虽然右派的报纸力求把这件事情说成好像苏联这个决定已经比西方国家“迟了”三年。
    意大利的政治人物和新闻界都热烈评述苏联的决定。“团结报”认为这一决定是“苏联的又一个重要的和平步骤”。资产阶级的“报信者报”由波恩发来的通讯承认，苏联最高苏维埃主席团的命令受到西德各阶层人民的广泛欢迎，阿登纳政策已引起人民的强烈反对和不满。
    瑞典报纸在显著地位报道关于苏联决定的消息。“瑞典日报”发表评论说：苏联最高苏维埃主席团的命令“不可能不对西德的舆论产生影响”。
  “每日新闻”在评论中指出，苏联最高苏维埃主席团的命令证明了“莫斯科力图使它同西德的关系正常化”。
    丹麦“政治报”政治评论员斯科夫指出：德国人民日益强烈地反抗军国主义化的政策。苏联关于结束同德国的战争状态的决定“在德国所引起的情绪，可能使继续执行军国主义化政策遭到更大的困难”。
    南斯拉夫的“战斗报”把这项命令的摘要刊载在第一页，标题是：“苏联决定结束和德国之间的战争状态”。“政治报”把这条消息加上了以下标题：“苏联结束了和德国之间的战争状态，并且希望和德国建立正常的关系”。
