    Winter has draped the Penholder Mountain and Centipede Ridge, which stand on either side of the Shi River in the upper reaches of the Huai River, in a pristine white coat. After the snowfall, the temperature in the valleys rapidly drops below zero degrees Celsius. However, the people building the Nanwan Reservoir are working tirelessly day and night to complete the dam foundation treatment project on schedule.

    The workers of the eighth team of the construction brigade are responsible for the task of pumping water at the construction site. Regardless of wind or snow, they always work in three shifts day and night beside the dozen or so water pumps on the intercepting ditch. At night, it is cold and windy, but the workers on duty still brave the heavy snow to walk to the open construction site. Sometimes they stand in the snow to drain water, and sometimes they stand in the water wearing rubber pants, their clothes completely frozen. When Youth League member Liu Shichang was building the pump shed, his hands were completely numb with cold, but he gritted his teeth and continued to work as usual. The workers of Group One of Construction Team One poured concrete in the rain, their clothes getting wet and then dried, and then wet again, but no one complained of the cold. The workers transporting materials carried heavy loads in the wind and snow, climbing the slopes and constantly delivering materials to the twenty-three-meter-high platform, ensuring the supply of materials for mixing concrete.

    南湾水库工地上的冬天
    淮河的上游，耸立在溮河两岸的笔架山和蜈蚣岭上，已经披上了一件洁白的冬装。山谷里降雪后气温迅速降到摄氏零度以下，但是，建造南湾水库的人们，为了按时完成拦河坝的坝基处理工程，仍在日夜不停地工作着。
    施工大队八中队的民工在工地上负担着抽水的任务。不论刮风下雪，他们总是日夜三班守在截水沟上十多部抽水机的旁边。夜里天冷风大，但是上班的民工们仍是冒着大雪向空阔的工地走去。他们有时站在雪地里排水，有时穿着胶裤站在水里排水，身上的衣服完全结成了冰。青年团员刘世长在盖抽水机工棚时，两手完全冻麻木了，但他咬着牙还是照常工作。建筑一中队一组的工人冒雨浇混凝土，衣服淋湿以后烤干了，烤干以后又淋湿，但是没有人说冷。参加运料的民工在风雪中担着沉重的担子，蹬上斜坡，不断地把料子送到二十三公尺高的平台上去，保证了拌和混凝土材料的供应。　　（新华社）
