Ten coal mining combines manufactured by the Jixi Mining Machinery Plant have all been completed and test runs were conducted in early January. In the spacious assembly workshop, rows of brand-new machines stood side by side, the blue bodies bearing the embossed red characters of "Donbas-1 type" combined coal mining machine. One of the coal mining combines, which will participate in the Leipzig International Fair, was shipped to Beijing on December 31st of last year. When the factory test-produced the first coal mining combine, it received assistance from Soviet expert Xizhuofu. This time, it also received guidance from sand casting expert Xie Jienikefu. Therefore, the test run results proved that the product quality has been further improved in terms of precision: all the gears on the machine tools have undergone meticulous processing, and the meshing is very tight and uniform; due to the improvement of sand casting, the number of sand holes in all castings has been reduced, and the surface of the machine case is also smooth and beautiful; the important parts of the machine body such as traction, cutting, crushing and loading have all reached the Soviet design standards.

    十台采煤康拜因制造成功
    鸡西矿山机械厂生产的十台采煤康拜因已全部完成，并在一月上旬进行了试车。在宽大的装配车间里，并列的放着一台台崭新的机器，蓝色的机体上铸着凸出的“顿巴斯—一型”联合采煤机的红色字样。其中将参加来比锡国际博览会的一台采煤康拜因已在去年十二月三十一日运到北京。这个厂在试造第一台采煤康拜因时，曾得到了苏联专家西卓夫的帮助，此次制造中又得到了翻砂专家谢杰尼柯夫的指导，因此试车结果证明，产品质量在精度上已有了进一步提高：机床上全部牙轮经过细密的加工后，咬合十分严密均匀；由于改进翻砂的结果，所有铸件中的砂眼已有减少，机壳的表面也很光滑美观；机体的牵引、截割、破碎及装载等重要部分都达到了苏联设计的标准。
