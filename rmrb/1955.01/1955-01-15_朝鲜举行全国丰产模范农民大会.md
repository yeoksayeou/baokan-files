The Korean National Conference of Model Farmers was held in Pyongyang from the 7th to the 9th, summarizing the experience of restoring and developing the rural economy in 1954, and discussing the production tasks for 1955.

Park Hoon-il, Minister of Agriculture of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, delivered a report to the conference. Park Hoon-il first talked about the significant achievements made in restoring and developing the rural economy in 1954. He said that in 1954, the Republic government issued long-term loans of more than 1.3 billion "Korean won" to agricultural producers' cooperatives and farmers, supplied farmers with approximately 13,000 tons of seeds, increased the production of farm tools and chemical fertilizers, began repairing many large and small irrigation projects, and expanded agricultural machine-cultivation stations and established more than 130 new horse-cultivation stations. Under the care of the Party and the government, agricultural producers' cooperative members and farmers actively labored, which significantly increased grain production in 1954.

Park Hoon-il pointed out that more than 9,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives have now been organized in rural areas, accounting for 30 percent of all farm households and 27 percent of all cultivated land. Agricultural producers' cooperatives in various places have fully demonstrated their superiority in the production increase campaign.

Park Hoon-il then put forward the agricultural production tasks for 1955. He called on all agricultural producers' cooperative members and farmers to first complete the production task of 3.3 million tons of grain in 1955, increase the production of technical crops and oil crops, and overfulfill the plan to expand more than 30,000 chongbo of cultivated land nationwide. In terms of animal husbandry, by the end of 1955, there should be more than 1.17 million pigs and more than 620,000 cattle.

    朝鲜举行全国丰产模范农民大会
    朝鲜全国丰产模范农民大会七日到九日在平壤举行，总结了一九五四年恢复和发展农村经济的经验，并讨论了一九五五年的生产任务。
    朝鲜劳动党中央委员会农业部长朴勋一向大会做了报告。朴勋一首先谈到一九五四年在恢复和发展农村经济方面所取得的重大成就。他说：共和国政府在一九五四年向农业生产合作社和农民发放了十三亿元“朝币”以上的长期贷款，供应了农民约一万三千吨种籽，增加了农具和化学肥料的生产，着手修复了许多大小灌溉工程，并扩建了农业机器代耕站和新设了一百三十多个马匹代耕站。各地农业生产合作社社员和农民们在党和政府的关怀下积极劳动，使一九五四年的谷物产量有了显著增加。
    朴勋一指出：今天在各地农村中已经组织起来的农业生产合作社已有九千多个，参加的农户占全部农户百分之三十，耕地占全部耕地面积的百分之二十七。各地农业生产合作社在增产运动中充分显示了优越性。
    朴勋一接着提出一九五五年农业生产的任务。他号召全体农业生产合作社社员和农民们在一九五五年要首先完成三百三十万吨谷物的生产任务，增加技术作物、油脂作物的生产，并超额完成全国扩大三万多町步耕地后的计划。在畜产方面，到一九五五年年底猪要达到一百十七万头以上，牛要达到六十二万头以上。
