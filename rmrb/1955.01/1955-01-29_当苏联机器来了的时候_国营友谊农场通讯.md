    When the Soviet Machines Arrived
    —Correspondences from the State-Run Friendship Farm
    By Our Correspondents, Li Wen and Yu Zhou

    The evening of January 16th.

    A group of young tractor drivers, truck drivers, and mechanics hurried out of the meeting hall, and the ongoing dance came to an abrupt halt. People were passing the word around: another trainload of "combines" would arrive at two o'clock in the morning.

    For days, people had been unloading train after train of Soviet machines, day and night. How the young men had hoped to indulge themselves this evening, to dispel the fatigue brought on by days of busy labor. Now, upon hearing this sudden news, they put on their hats, draped on their coats, and happily walked out of the meeting hall echoing with melodious music, back to their dormitories to rest early, preparing to welcome this new batch of machines sent by the Soviet Union.

    But no sooner had they fallen asleep than it was past one o'clock in the morning. People jumped out of their warm beds and rushed from the various dormitories of the State-Run Friendship Farm Preparatory Office towards the station. At this time, the thermometer read twenty-eight degrees Celsius below zero.

    Tractor drivers, Soviet experts, the general branch secretary, agronomists all arrived at the station, and even the young nurse ran over with her first-aid kit on her back.

    People crowded onto the platform. They would glance in the direction the train was coming from, and then look at the night scene of the farm. In the distance, in the northwest corner, in the direction of the farm preparatory office, a white light covered the low thatched roofs. There, a few streetlights blinked wearily at the people. To the northeast, rows of low thatched huts lay sparse and quiet. Only the creaking sound of trucks and tractors coming from the enclosure to the south where the machines were parked broke the tranquility of this small town slumbering near the prairie—Fulitun....

    At the station, the sound emanating from the cranes vibrated in people's eardrums. Crane operators were heating up the vehicles. Young assistant Li Shulin carried pot after pot of hot water to the vehicle and poured it into the water tank. Shan Chengxian, sitting in the vehicle, started the engine for a while, then stuck his head out to look around at his assistant. People were no strangers to this crane operator. When the water tank of the box-moving machine froze up, he poured hot water on it and took off his own cotton coat to put it on the water tank, enabling the box-moving machine to start up and continue working. On the night of the thirteenth, he worked for six hours straight, and after unloading six train cars of "combines," he and two assistants volunteered to unload an extra car of five-bottom plows. People said, "When it's his shift, he comes to the station to work; when it's not his shift, he also comes here to work." Many times, he would take time out in the shed to eat the lunch his assistants brought him. He remembered the instructions given to him by the leaders when he came from the Northeast State Farm Administration to support the Friendship Farm: You go with honor, but you must return with honor! Yes, he had not disappointed the people's hopes of him.

    The train finally arrived. In the moonlight, a long train of black shadows crawled into the station. People crowded to the edge of the platform. Two Soviet experts, holding flashlights, walked along the platform, examining the brand names of one tall "combine" after another. People went to the cars and affectionately stroked them. Obviously, people had deep feelings for these machines.

    This was the seventeenth time machines had been sent.

    More than ten days ago, the first batch of tractors was transported to Fulitun. That night at eleven o'clock, the comrades of the machine crew living in the southern suburbs of Fulitun, as usual, finished their Russian lesson and had just crawled into bed when the telephone rang. Technician Lao Li, as if he had encountered a great happy event, shouted repeatedly: "The office is calling, the tractors have arrived! The tractors have arrived!" People hurriedly threw open their blankets, got dressed, and ran to the station in one breath. The train arrived. "One, two, three..." People happily counted the tractors and trucks on the train, praising them repeatedly: "What new machines!" Truck drivers were busy looking at the trucks. The so-called Hercules Stalin 80 tractor was the latest product of 1954. The ZIS automatic loading and unloading truck was a new product from the Stalin Automobile Factory in December of last year. Its lights are more beautiful than before, and the switches are more responsive than before. The Stalin 80 tractor is the newest type, and the air cleaner has an extended tube to reduce wear and tear inside the engine. This new improvement will extend the life of the tractor. At three o'clock in the morning, the young men returned to the dormitory with excitement and joy. The leadership decided to let them sleep for three hours and go to unload the cars at dawn, but everyone was unwilling to sleep and couldn't fall asleep anyway. The comrades of the truck group lay in their beds, listening to veteran driver Liu Xiang talk about the advantages and characteristics of the Soviet-made ZIS truck and the problems that should be paid attention to when driving this truck. The tractor drivers, without taking off their clothes, gathered around the stove, talking excitedly. They talked about the newest machines, about their heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet elder brother, about the farm where they used to work, about the new farm under construction....

    From that day on, they threw themselves into the intense labor of unloading and transporting the machines.

    Tonight, when twenty-six shiny "iron giants"—combines—suddenly appeared before the people, they stirred up new excitement and joy among the people.

    Wang Yinpo, the leader of the machine crew, walked back and forth with great interest. He could not suppress the joy in his heart, and while constantly discussing something with the Soviet machine experts, he directed everyone to unload and transport the machines.

    People were busy unloading the machines, forgetting the cold of the late night. When the lights of the trucks illuminated the crowd, one could see that many people's coats were covered with a layer of ice frost, and some people's eyebrows were covered with frost flowers.

    People saw off the night in intense labor. During the day, another group of comrades from the machine crew came to the station. Forty members of agricultural production cooperatives such as Zhenli and Xinli in the town, workers from the grain company, and freight workers from Fulitun Station also rushed to help the Friendship Farm unload and transport the machines.

    The crane swayed its giant arm, lifted the "combine" from the train, and gently placed it next to the platform. Two old farmers who came from the north end of the town to visit were fascinated. They had seen the machines of the tractor station cultivate the land for the farmers, but they had never seen such a large and new "combine." The two pointed to a few eleven or twelve-year-old children watching the fun beside them, and said with emotion, "These children were really born in a good time. When they grow up, machines will be 'universal,' and they will never suffer like us, bending over and backbreaking."

    当苏联机器来了的时候
    ——国营友谊农场通讯
    本报记者　力文  雨舟
    一月十六日的晚间。
    一群年轻的拖拉机手、汽车司机和修理工们匆匆忙忙地走出了会议厅，正在进行着的舞会顿时静下来了。人们互相传告着：在下半夜两点钟，又将有一批满载着“康拜因”的火车来到这里。
    多少天了，人们不分白天和夜晚，卸下了一列又一列火车的苏联机器。年轻的小伙子们是多么希望在这个夜晚，来纵情地玩上一番，消除连日来繁忙劳动所带给的困倦。现在他们听到这个突如其来的消息，又戴上帽子，披上大衣，愉快地走出这回荡着悠扬乐声的会议厅，走回宿舍去早点休息，准备迎接这批苏联送来的新机器。
    但是，刚睡下，已是下半夜一点多了。人们跳出了温暖的被窝，从国营友谊农场筹备处的各个宿舍奔向车站。这时，寒暑表上的温度计，正指着摄氏零下二十八度。
    拖拉机手们、苏联专家、总支书记、农学家们都到了车站上，年轻的小护士也背着救急包跑来了。
    人们挤在站台上。一会儿望一望火车开来的方向，一会儿看看农场的夜景。远方，在西北角农场筹备处办公室的方向，一片白光覆盖在低矮的茅屋的上空。在那里，几只路灯疲倦地向人们眨着眼。在东北边，一排排低矮的茅屋稀疏、幽静地躺在那里。只有从南边停放着机器的围场内开来的汽车和拖拉机的轧轧声，打破了这个沉睡在草原近旁的小镇——福利屯的恬静……。
    车站上，从吊车中发出的声音震动着人们的耳鼓。吊车工们正在烤车。年轻的助手李树林把一壶一壶的热水提到车上倒到水箱里去。坐在车上的单承先，发动一会机器，又把头伸出来向外望一望，看一看他的助手。对于这位吊车工，人们并不生疏。当搬箱机的水箱冻住的时候，他用热水来浇车，并脱下自己的棉衣搭在水箱上，使搬箱机开动起来，继续进行工作。在十三日夜晚，他一连工作了六个小时，卸完了六个车皮的“康拜因”以后，又和两个助手自动要求多卸了一车五铧犁。人们说：“该他上班的时候他来车站工作，不该他上班的时候他也来这里工作。”多少次，他都是在车棚里抽空吃着助手们给他带来的午饭。他记得他从东北国营农场管理局来支援友谊农场的时候领导上对他的嘱托：光荣的去了，可要光荣的回来呀！是的，他没有辜负了人们对他的希望。
    火车终于来了。月光下，长长的一列黑影蠕动着走进车站。人们拥到了月台的边沿。两个苏联专家拿着手电，沿着月台，察看着一台又一台高大的
  “康拜因”的牌号。人们走到车上，亲热地抚摸着它们。显然，人们对这些机器有着深厚的感情。
    这已是第十七次送来机器了。
    十几天以前，第一批拖拉机运到福利屯。那天晚上十一点，住在福利屯南郊的机务组的同志们照例学完了一课俄文，刚钻进了被窝里，电话铃响起来了。接电话的技术员老李，像遇见大喜事一样，连声喊叫着：“办公室来电话，拖拉机到了！拖拉机到了！”人们急忙地掀开被窝，穿好衣服，一气跑到了车站。火车来到了。“一台、二台、三台……”，人们愉快地数点着列车上的拖拉机和汽车，连声称赞着：“好新的机器！”汽车司机忙着去看汽车。号称大力士的斯大林八十号拖拉机是一九五四年的最新出品。吉士牌自动装卸载重汽车是斯大林汽车工厂去年十二月份的新产品。它的灯比过去更漂亮，开关比过去更灵便了。斯大林八十号拖拉机是最新式的，空气清净器增长了延长管，减少了发动机内部的磨损，这一新的改善，会使拖拉机寿命延长。午夜三时，小伙子们带着兴奋和愉快回到宿舍，领导方面决定让他们睡上三个钟头，天明再去卸车，可是，大家都不愿去睡，睡也睡不着。汽车小组的同志们躺在被窝里，听老司机刘襄讲述苏联造吉士车的优点、特性，开这种车应该注意的问题。拖拉机手们衣服也不脱，围着炉火，你一言，他一语，兴奋地谈论起来。他们谈最新的机器，谈自己从心眼里感激苏联老大哥，谈自己工作过的那个农场，谈正在建设中的新农场……。
    从这天起，他们投入紧张卸运机器的劳动中。
    今晚，当二十六台油亮放光的“钢铁巨人”——康拜因突然出现在人们面前的时候，又掀起了人们新的兴奋和欢乐。
    机务组组长王荫坡兴致勃勃地来回走动着。他抑止不住心头的喜悦，一面不时地和苏联机务专家商量着什么，一面指挥着大家卸运机器。
    人们忙着卸机器，忘记了深夜的寒冷。当载重汽车的灯光照亮人群的时候，看得见，不少人的大衣抹上了一层冰霜，有些人的眉毛上挂上霜花了。
    人们在紧张劳动中送走了黑夜。白天，机务组的另一批同志来到车站，镇上的镇利、新利等农业生产合作社的四十名社员、粮食公司的工人、福利车站的搬运工人也赶来帮助友谊农场卸运机器。
    吊车摇动着巨臂，从火车上吊起“康拜因”，把它轻轻地放到月台旁。从镇北头跑来参观的两位老农民看得出神了，他们看见过拖拉机站的机器给农民耕地，却没有见过这样大和这样新的“康拜因”。两个人指着身旁几个看热闹的十一、二岁的小孩，感慨地谈论着：“这些小孩真生在好年月了，到他们长大成人的时候，机器便‘普遍’了，他们再也不像咱们那样，弯腰曲背地受苦了。”
