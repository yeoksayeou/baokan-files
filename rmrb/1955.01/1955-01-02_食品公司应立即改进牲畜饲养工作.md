Food companies should immediately improve livestock breeding

In order to meet the needs of the masses for meat during the New Year and Spring Festival, food companies across the country are actively purchasing pigs, cattle, and sheep, and are appropriately increasing reserves. This practice is very necessary. However, recently this newspaper has received letters from many readers reflecting that within the state-owned food company system, the death, emergency slaughter, softening, disease, and emaciation of pigs, cattle, and sheep are very serious. For example, from December 3rd to December 17th last year, in just half a month, the Beijing Food Company's inventory of pigs saw 3,670 deaths, 7,122 emergency slaughters, 13,492 requiring processing before they could be sold, and 475 completely discarded. The Beijing Food Company had over 10,000 cattle pastured in Nankou. Due to poor management, there was no one specifically responsible for grazing, insufficient feed, dilapidated pens, and with the recent drop in temperature, dozens were freezing and starving to death every day. This phenomenon also exists in warehouses and breeding farms in large cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, and Guangzhou, and in some medium and small cities. The Tianjin Food Company's processing and supply station has relatively good facilities for storing pigs, but in early December, 616 pigs died and 3,816 were emergency slaughtered. In Guangzhou, more than half of the pork slaughtered by the Guangzhou Food Company had to be processed and re-made before it could be sold. The Wuwei Special District Office of the Gansu Provincial Food Company recently purchased more than 7,000 large fat sheep and more than 50 cattle, but because they did not prepare for the cold weather in advance, many cattle and sheep were frozen to death. This situation has existed for a long time in the past, and has become even more serious recently.

What are the reasons for such significant losses? According to readers' letters, the main reason is that some food companies are simply pursuing the quantity of purchases and have not paid enough attention to the breeding and management of pigs, etc. They did not make the necessary preparations before the purchase, resulting in a chaotic situation of no one being responsible for the breeding and management as the reserves of pigs, cattle, and sheep rapidly expanded. In the harsh winter, an important aspect of maintaining livestock is ensuring they are "well-fed and warmly housed," but many food company breeding management personnel have failed to do this. According to readers, it is common for pigs, cattle, and sheep to be underfed or even not fed for several days. For example, the Pingdi Spring Food Branch Company in Inner Mongolia originally planned to purchase 5,000 cattle and 10,000 sheep in 1954, but by the end of November last year, it had already purchased 9,000 cattle and 26,000 sheep, exceeding the original plan by one to two times. Although the amount of purchases increased, the Pingdi Spring Food Branch Company turned a blind eye to problems such as the lack of sheds, insufficient forage, and water difficulties, and failed to take timely measures to solve them. As a result, a large number of livestock died and lost weight. Recently, more than 1,000 pigs died in the Pingdi Spring Food Branch Company. Inspections and veterinary autopsies proved that most of them died of starvation. For example, on December 17th, a batch of pigs transported from the Shanxi Provincial Food Company to Tianjin died more than 70, because the escorts did not pay attention to feeding and management during transportation, and some had not been fed for three days. In addition, some food companies have not paid attention to improving livestock shed facilities where possible and doing a good job in preventing cold, with ice forming in some pigsties and drafts coming from all sides, but no one cares. Some units also do not pay attention to the isolated breeding and necessary treatment of sick pigs, causing great losses to the state.

In response to the above phenomena, food companies in various regions must quickly take effective measures to strengthen the feeding and management of livestock such as pigs, cattle, and sheep in reserves. Some people believe that it is difficult to manage live commodities, the current equipment is poor, experience is insufficient, and deaths are inevitable. This view is wrong. With the Spring Festival approaching, the market supply of meat is gradually increasing. To do a good job in this supply work, food company units must not only do a good job in procurement, but also do a corresponding good job in the feeding and management of live commodities such as pigs, cattle, and sheep. Relevant departments in various regions should organize necessary inspections, immediately correct shortcomings in breeding management, and stop the deaths of pigs, cattle, and sheep in reserves.

### 食品公司应立即改进牲畜饲养工作

    食品公司应立即改进牲畜饲养工作
    为了供应群众在新年和春节前后的肉食需要，各地食品公司正积极地收购毛猪、牛、羊，并适当增加储备量，这种做法是十分必要的。但是，最近本报接到许多读者来信反映，在国营食品公司系统中，猪、牛、羊的死亡、急宰、软病、消瘦现象非常严重。如：从去年十二月三日到十七日半个月中，北京市食品公司库存的猪就死亡三千六百七十口，急宰七千一百二十二口，需要加工才能出售的有一万三千四百九十二口，全部废弃的有四百七十五口。北京市食品公司在南口寄放了一万多条牛，因为管理不好，没有专人放牧，饲料不足，圈棚破烂，更加上近日气温下降，一天就冻死饿死数十条。这种现象在上海、天津、武汉、广州等大城市和某些中、小城市的仓库和饲养场里，也同样存在着。天津食品公司加工供应站的毛猪仓库设备是比较好的，在十二月上旬也死了六百一十六口猪，急宰了三千八百一十六口。广州市食品公司屠宰后的猪肉竟有一半以上必须加工复制后才能出售。甘肃省食品公司武威专区办事处第一牧场最近收购了七千多只大肥羊、五十多条牛，因为天气冷事先没有做好御寒设备，许多牛羊都被冻死了。这种情况，过去已经长期存在，而最近更加严重。
    造成这种重大损失的原因究竟在哪里呢？根据读者来信分析，主要是由于某些食品公司单纯追求采购数量，对于毛猪等的饲养管理工作没有引起足够的重视，收购以前没有做好必要的准备工作，以致在猪、牛、羊的储备量迅速扩大的情况下，饲养管理工作上出现了无人负责的混乱现象。在严寒的冬天，保养牲畜的重要环节就是保证它们“吃得饱，住得暖”，然而许多食品公司的饲养管理人员却没有做到这一点。据读者反映，猪、牛、羊吃不饱，甚至几天没有喂食的情况很普遍。如：内蒙古平地泉食品分公司原计划一九五四年收购五千头牛、一万只羊，但是到了去年十一月底已经收购了九千头牛、二万六千只羊，超过原有计划的一倍至二倍。收购量增加了，但平地泉食品分公司对于棚圈缺乏，草料不足，水源困难等问题，却熟视无睹，不及时设法解决。因此，造成大量牲畜死亡和掉膘现象。最近平地泉食品分公司死了一千多头猪，经检查和兽医人员解剖证明，大部分是饿死的。又如：十二月十七日，从山西省食品公司运到天津一批猪，因为押运人员不注意运输中的饲养管理，有的三天没有喂食，以致死亡七十多头。此外，有些食品公司没有注意在可能条件下改进牲畜的棚圈设备，做好防寒工作，有的猪圈里结了冰，四面通风，却无人过问。还有些单位不注意病猪的隔离饲养和作必要的治疗，给国家造成很大的损失。
    对于上述现象，各地食品公司必须迅速采取有效措施，加强猪、牛、羊等牲畜储备中的饲养管理工作。有的人认为活商品经营困难，目前设备差，经验不足，死亡现象是不可避免的。这种看法是错误的。随着春节的即将到来，肉食的市场供应量正逐渐增大，要做好这次供应工作，食品公司各单位不仅要做好采购工作，同时还必须相应地做好猪、牛、羊等活商品的饲养管理工作。各地有关部门应该组织必要的检查，立即纠正饲养管理工作中的缺点，制止猪、牛、羊等储备中的死亡现象。
