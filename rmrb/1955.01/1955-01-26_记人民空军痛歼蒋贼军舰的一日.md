    A Day of the People's Air Force Triumphantly Annihilating Chiang Kai-shek's Bandit Warships
    By Hu Changming, Political Commissar of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army Air Force

    January 10th was a day when our People's Air Force on the Zhejiang East Front gave Chiang Kai-shek's bandit warships a severe punishment. As soon as it dawned, the young mechanics, in formation, arrived at the airport, preparing the planes with great intensity. The morning was the time for our People's bomber fleet to practice flying. After the pilots steadily flew the planes and completed the training syllabus successfully, they returned and landed. The superiors notified them, saying: "Aircrew comrades, quickly prepare to execute combat missions; ground crew comrades, quickly conduct post-flight checks, refuel, load bombs, and prepare for combat takeoff." Hearing this gratifying news, all comrades were nervous and happily engaged in pre-war preparations. The comrades from the airfield brought the bombs, and each team quickly devoted themselves to the bomb-loading work according to the steps that had already been assigned. How fast! Each team completed the bomb-loading task ahead of schedule. They were afraid of not loading them well, so they checked them repeatedly to ensure that each bomb was loaded up to standard.
    The unit commander issued combat orders to the aircrew comrades participating in the battle. His short and powerful words inspired the hearts of every comrade. Finally, he said: "Our People's Air Force, in order not to disappoint the Party, the superiors, and the people of the whole country who have placed their hopes on us, today our bombing force must use a brave, resourceful, bold, and calm fighting spirit to accurately drop the bombs on the designated targets. ... Use victory to thank the Party and the superiors for their cultivation and education of us, and to thank the people of the whole country for their hope and concern for us."
    After the unit commander explained the mission, the participating aircrew comrades immediately carried out intensive pre-takeoff preparations for combat. Soon, all the participating aircrew comrades entered the cockpits, waiting for the signal to take off for battle. Thousands of eyes were watching the command platform. It seemed as if they were saying: "Dear leaders! Please fire the signal flare quickly! Let our iron eagles go and strike the enemy sooner!"
    Suddenly, a green signal flare rose into the sky, hanging in the air like a green ribbon. The command platform issued the order to start the engines. In an instant, the engines of the planes started, and one after another, they taxied out. The iron eagles took off, flying in neat formation, bravely towards the harbor of Dachen Island.
    Our neat bomber fleet, under the strong protection of fraternal units, quickly approached the harbor of Dachen Island. From a distance in the air, we saw many enemy warships anchored in the harbor. The fire of revenge in the hearts of the aerial warriors was burning rapidly. For many days, these sea bandits had been destroying the happy lives of the coastal fishermen and disrupting our maritime traffic. The lead aircraft, Deputy Unit Commander Zhang Weiliang, immediately told all comrades in the fleet by radio: "Don't let them run away, we must sink them." He steadily flew the plane over the bandit warship, and Navigation Director Cai Zhichen used the bombsight to tightly lock onto the bandit warship, calmly aimed, and dropped the bomb in a timely and accurate manner, hitting the enemy's "Zhong-class" landing ship. Thick smoke and flames rose instantly. Another fleet also followed closely, flying over the bandit warship and dropping bombs in a timely manner, also accurately hitting the bandit warship. How excited the aerial warriors were! When the first batch of aerial fleets turned around and returned after successfully dropping their bombs, they clearly saw the bandit warship that had been hit burning in the thick smoke and flames.
    Another bombing fleet flew over the other anchorage in the enemy harbor and also hit another enemy warship.
    The news of victory sent back from the distant skies of Dachen Harbor quickly spread throughout the entire airport. The crowd at the airport burst into laughter and singing. Hearing the sound of the engines, everyone's eyes turned to the direction of the sound. Look! Our majestic eagle fleet, in neat formation, returned victoriously. The comrades at the airport cheered enthusiastically! Our dear comrades returned victoriously! One after another, they landed smoothly and taxied back to the apron nimbly. The leaders, the comrades from the offices, and the comrades from the ground crews all warmly shook hands and congratulated the victorious heroes. Crowds surrounded each plane, talking everywhere about the circumstances of striking the enemy.
    On this very day, another fraternal unit of ours also damaged two enemy warships. On this day, our People's Air Force on the Zhejiang East Front sank and damaged a total of four bandit warships.

    记人民空军痛歼蒋贼军舰的一日
    中国人民解放军空军某部分队政治委员  胡长明
    一月十日，是我浙东前线人民空军给蒋贼军舰严厉惩罚的一天。早上天一亮，年青的机械员们，就整队来到了机场，紧张地准备着飞机。上午，是我们人民轰炸机群练习飞行的时间。当飞行员们平稳地驾驶着飞机，圆满完成训练课目，返航着陆以后，上级首长就通知说：“空勤同志迅速准备执行战斗任务；地勤同志迅速作飞行后检查，加油、挂弹，准备战斗起飞。”听到这个可喜的消息，所有的同志都紧张而又愉快地进行战前准备工作。场站的同志把炸弹运来了，每个机组按照已经分工好的步骤，迅速投入挂弹工作。多么迅速呀！每个机组都按照规定提前完成了挂弹任务。他们唯恐挂的不好，又翻来覆去地进行检查，使每个炸弹都挂得非常合乎标准。
    部队长给参战的空勤同志下达战斗命令，他简短而有力的话语，振奋了每个同志的心。最后他说：“我们人民空军，为了不辜负党和上级首长及全国人民对我们的希望，今天我们的轰炸部队，必须以英勇、机智、大胆、沉着的战斗精神，把炸弹准确地投到指定的目标上，……。以胜利来答谢党和上级首长对我们的培养和教育，答谢全国人民对我们的希望和关怀。”
    部队长交代任务后，参战的空勤同志，即进行紧张的战斗起飞前准备工作。不久参战的空勤同志全部进入了座舱，等待起飞战斗的讯号，千百只眼睛都望着指挥台。好像说：“亲爱的首长！快点打信号弹吧！让我们的铁鹰早一点去打击敌人！”
    忽然间绿色的信号弹升到了天空，好像绿色的绸带一样挂在空中。指挥台上发出开车命令了，转瞬间飞机的马达都开动起来，一架接着一架地滑出。铁鹰起飞了，排着整齐的队形，勇敢地飞向大陈岛港湾去了。
    我们这一队整齐的轰炸机群，在兄弟部队强有力的掩护下，很快就接近了大陈岛港湾。在空中很远的地方，就望见港湾里停泊着很多的敌人军舰。空中勇士们心中复仇的怒火在迅速燃烧。多少天来，就是这些海贼，破坏沿海渔民的幸福生活，扰乱我们海上的交通。带队长机副部队长张伟良，立即用无线电告诉机群全体同志说：“不要让它跑掉，一定要把它炸沉。”他平稳地把飞机飞向贼舰上空，领航主任蔡志臣用瞄准具紧紧地套住贼舰，沉着瞄准，及时而准确地投下炸弹，击中敌人“中字号”登陆舰，浓烟烈火即时升空。另一机群，也紧跟着飞临这个贼舰上空，及时投下炸弹，也非常准确地炸中这只贼舰。空中勇士们多么兴奋啊！第一批空中机群胜利投完炸弹转弯返航时，明显地看见被炸中的那艘贼舰在烈火浓烟中燃烧。
    另一个轰炸机群飞临敌港湾的另一锚地上空，也炸中了敌人另一艘军舰。
    从遥远的大陈港湾上空，发回来的胜利消息，迅速传遍了整个机场。机场上的人群，发出欢笑声和歌声。听到马达声了，大家的眼睛都不约而同地朝向那个发出响声的方向。看吧！我们雄壮的鹰群编着整齐的队形，胜利地回来了。机场的同志们热烈欢叫！亲爱的战友胜利地回来了！一架跟着一架平稳地着陆，矫健地滑回停机坪。首长，机关的同志，地勤的同志，都热烈地和胜利回来的英雄们握手，祝贺。每架飞机旁都围满了人群，到处谈着打击敌人的情况。
    也就是这一天，我们另一个兄弟部队又击伤敌舰两艘。这天我们浙东前线人民空军共击沉击伤贼舰四艘。
