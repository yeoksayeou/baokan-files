Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 6th: The Japan-China Friendship Association recently held an expanded meeting of its council in Tokyo to discuss and determine the future direction of the Japan-China friendship movement.

The meeting pointed out that the Japan-China friendship movement had made significant progress in 1954. Throughout the country, surrounding the visits to China by members of the Diet and representatives of various groups, the publication of the joint Sino-Soviet declaration on Japan, and the issue of peaceful coexistence and normalization of diplomatic relations, the sentiment for Japan-China friendship reached a very high level. Among the Japanese people, there is a firm belief that the two countries can coexist peacefully, a firm belief that the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries can be realized, and a deep understanding that efforts must be made for this purpose.

Based on this situation, the meeting decided that the direction of the Japan-China friendship movement this year is to further develop the movement to demand the restoration of Japan-China and Japan-Soviet diplomatic relations throughout the country, and to conduct publicity activities centered on the movement to demand the restoration of Japan-China and Japan-Soviet diplomatic relations during the general election in February and March.

Finally, the meeting also decided on the main work plan before the Fifth National Congress of the Japan-China Friendship Association, which will be held in July this year. According to this plan, the Japan-China Friendship Association will widely organize discussions among the masses in various parts of the country on the joint Sino-Soviet declaration on Japan, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and Premier Zhou Enlai's talks with the two Japanese visiting delegations; launch activities to invite Chinese trade and cultural envoys to Japan; and hold Chinese cultural relic exhibitions, screen Chinese films, and build Japan-China Friendship Halls in various places.

    日中友协理事会扩大会议决定
    进一步开展恢复日中、日苏邦交运动
   【新华社六日讯】东京消息：日中友好协会最近在东京举行理事会扩大会议，讨论并决定了今后日中友好运动的方针。
    会议指出：日中友好运动在一九五四年有了飞跃的发展，在全国范围内，环绕着国会议员、各个团体代表的访问中国，中苏两国对日联合宣言的发表以及和平共处和外交关系正常化的问题，日中友好的情绪达到非常高涨的程度。在日本人民中间，确信两国可以和平共处，确信恢复两国的邦交一定可以实现，并深知必须为此而努力。
    会议根据这种形势，决定今年日中友好运动的方针是：在全国范围内进一步发展要求恢复日中、日苏邦交的运动，并在二、三月举行大选期间，也以要求恢复日中、日苏邦交运动为中心进行宣传活动。
    会议最后还决定了在今年七月召开日中友好协会第五届全国大会以前的主要工作计划。根据这个计划，日中友好协会将在全国各地广泛组织群众讨论中苏两国对日联合宣言、和平共处五项原则和周恩来总理对日本两个访华代表团的谈话内容；展开邀请中国贸易和文化使节到日本的活动；并在各地举办中国文物展览会、上映中国影片、筹建日中友好馆等。
