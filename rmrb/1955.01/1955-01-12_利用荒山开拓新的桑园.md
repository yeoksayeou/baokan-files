Advancing on the Socialist Road

    Liyang County, Jiangsu Province, is a semi-mountainous area, with 400,000 mu of barren hills that have not yet been utilized, of which over 100,000 mu have fertile soil suitable for planting mulberry trees and raising silkworms. Based on the policy of restoring and developing silk production, the Party and government leaders of Liyang decided to utilize the barren hills to develop 10,000 mu of new mulberry orchards, planting 1.5 million mulberry trees.
    Currently, six districts in the county have launched a warm movement of digging ponds and planting mulberry trees. The Shannan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xinchang Township decided to open up 100 mu of barren hills for mulberry planting. Male and female cooperative members are all very enthusiastic. Production instructor Zhu Yuliang digs 32 standard ponds every day, and female cooperative member Shen Fengying digs 13 standard ponds in half a day. Currently, 696,000 mulberry tree ponds have been dug throughout the county. Walking into the mountainous area, the mountains and fields are full of people digging ponds and planting mulberry trees.

    利用荒山开拓新的桑园
    江苏省溧阳县是个半山区，全县有四十万亩荒山尚未利用，其中有十几万亩土质肥沃，适宜栽桑养蚕。溧阳党、政领导上根据恢复和发展蚕丝生产的方针，决定利用荒山开拓新桑园一万亩，栽植桑树一百五十万株。
    目前全县有六个区已掀起热烈的开塘栽桑运动。新昌乡山南农业生产合作社决定开一百亩荒山栽桑。男女社员个个劲头很足，生产指导员朱玉良每天开三十二个标准塘，女社员沈凤英半天时间开好标准塘十三个。现在全县已开好六十九万六千个桑树塘。走到山区，满山遍野都是开塘栽桑的人。
