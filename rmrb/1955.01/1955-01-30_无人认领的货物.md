To the Editor Regarding Unclaimed Goods:

　　Last December, the Guang'anmen Railway Station in Beijing, in accordance with the regulations for handling unclaimed goods, sold four hundred sheets of black lambskins to the Beijing branch of the China Animal By-Products Corporation. These skins were originally shipped from Guang'anmen Railway Station in Beijing to Tianjin on May 4th of last year (along with seventy-five other pieces of skins sent to Tianjin from Xi'an). Because there was no waybill or other markings, the Tianjin North Station returned the goods to Guang'anmen Railway Station in Beijing. For months, no one inquired about them.

　　Where did these skins come from? In order to find the owner of the goods, the Beijing branch of the China Animal By-Products Corporation conducted a detailed appraisal of the goods. It was proven that these black lambskins originated from the Zhangjiachuan area of Northwest China, and it was discovered that the tails of the skins were all stamped with the character "Ping" [平]. Further investigation revealed that on April 15th of last year, the Northwest China Animal By-Products Corporation's business section (located in Xi'an) shipped seventy-five pieces of skins to Tianjin in the twenty-second batch, number forty-two, including twenty pieces of small-haired black lambskins and fifty-five pieces of small-haired white lambskins. In May, after these goods were transported to Tianjin, it was discovered during inspection that one piece (four hundred sheets) of black lambskins purchased from Pingliang was missing, and one piece (four hundred sheets) of white lambskins was extra. At the same time, it was found that the twenty-fifth batch of skins shipped from the Northwest China Animal By-Products Corporation to Tianjin was short one piece (four hundred sheets) of white lambskins. Thus, based on the shipping time, the quantity loaded, the quantity short, the place of purchase, and the "Ping" character marking, the matter is very clear. The owner of these "unclaimed" goods must be the Northwest China Animal By-Products Corporation. However, the Northwest China Animal By-Products Corporation does not admit that it is their goods!

　　This is truly strange! The skins are clearly from the Zhangjiachuan area of Northwest China, the tails of the skins are stamped with the "Ping" character of Pingliang, and they were shipped to Tianjin along with goods from Xi'an. Why does the Northwest China Animal By-Products Corporation not admit that these are their goods?

　　In the 1954 fiscal year, the Northwest China Animal By-Products Corporation frequently experienced mold, rot, and miscounting accidents in the transfer and transport of goods. Although the leading comrades of this company have made written self-criticisms and guarantees, mistakes continue to occur. According to incomplete statistics, the Northwest China Animal By-Products Corporation made sixty-nine errors in the quantity of skins transported in the past year alone. Can such obvious errors be covered up?

### 无人认领的货物

    无人认领的货物编辑同志：
    去年十二月，北京广安门车站按照无人认领的货物处理办法，把一批黑猾皮四百张售给了中国畜产公司北京市公司。这批皮张是去年五月四日由北京广安门车站转站发往天津的（同车的还有从西安发天津的皮张七十五件），因为没有货票，也没有其他标记，天津北站就把原货退回了北京广安门车站。几个月来无人过问。
    这些皮张究竟是从哪里来的呢？中国畜产公司北京市公司为了查找货物的主人，对货物进行了详细的鉴定。证明这种黑猾皮产自西北张家川一带，并且发现皮张尾部都盖有“平”字印记。再经过调查，原来是去年四月十五日，西北区畜产公司业务科（地址在西安）发天津的第二十二批四十二号皮张就是七十五件，其中有小毛黑猾皮二十件，小毛白羔皮五十五件。五月里，这些货物运到天津以后，在验收时发现其中缺少了平凉收购的黑猾皮一件（四百张）而多了白羔皮一件（四百张），同时，并查出西北区畜产公司发往天津的第二十五批皮张中短少了白羔皮一件（四百张）。这样，从运输时间、装载数量和短少数量，收购地点同“平”字印记等情况看来，问题已经十分清楚了。这件“无人认领”的货物的主人，一定是西北区畜产公司。然而，西北区畜产公司却不承认是他们的货物！
    这真是怪事！皮张明明是西北张家川一带的货物，皮张尾巴上盖着平凉的“平”字，是随西安的货发往天津的，为什么西北区畜产公司却不承认这是他们的货物呢？
    在一九五四年度里，西北区畜产公司在调运商品上经常发生霉烂和错数事故，这个公司的领导同志虽然也做过书面检讨和保证，但是错误仍然不断发生。据不完全统计，一年来西北区畜产公司仅在皮张运输数量上发生的差错就有六十九起。像这样彰明较著的差错难道还能掩盖吗？　振秋
