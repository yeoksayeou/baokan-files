    Spring Festival Greetings to Revolutionary Martyrs' Families, Revolutionary Servicemen's Families, Disabled Revolutionary Soldiers, and Demobilized Soldiers Engaged in Construction
    By Xie Juezai, Minister of Internal Affairs of the People's Republic of China

    Dear comrades, families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary servicemen, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized soldiers engaged in construction!
    The Spring Festival of 1955 is here, and I extend my heartfelt congratulations to you with joy!
    In the past year, our motherland has achieved tremendous accomplishments in political, economic, and cultural construction. First, the general election was completed nationwide, local people's congresses at all levels and the National People's Congress were convened, and the Constitution of the People's Republic of China was promulgated, further perfecting our people's democratic system and consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship. In industrial production and basic construction, more than 300 major industrial construction projects were newly built, renovated, and continued across the country. Agricultural mutual aid and cooperation organizations have seen greater development. Taking agricultural producers' cooperatives as an example, before the autumn harvest last year, there were more than 220,000 nationwide, and now the number has increased to more than 400,000. In agricultural production, although we suffered from floods unseen in a century last year, thanks to the heroic flood prevention and rescue efforts of party and government leaders at all levels and the broad masses of people, the losses from the flood disaster were finally mitigated. The People's Government allocated large amounts of grain and funds to provide relief to the affected people. The total grain harvest nationwide still increased compared to previous years. The material and cultural lives of our people have been correspondingly improved and enhanced.
    Dear comrades! The reason why our motherland has been able to achieve such great accomplishments is inseparable from the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, from the contributions of the relatives of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary servicemen—the People's Liberation Army—in holding their posts on the border and coastal defense lines and safeguarding the motherland, from your efforts and those of the people across the country in actively participating in industrial and mining production, agricultural production, and mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and from the contributions of disabled revolutionary soldiers and demobilized soldiers engaged in construction who fought heroically on the front lines.
    Comrades! I believe that you, like the people across the country, are happy about these achievements. However, the U.S. imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous clique are very unhappy that we are living a better life day by day. They are unwilling for us to build a happy and prosperous socialist society in a peaceful environment, and they are constantly trying in every possible way to undermine our cause. The U.S. imperialists recently openly signed a so-called "mutual defense treaty" with Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous clique, blatantly occupying our country's sacred territory of Taiwan. The U.S. imperialists are attempting to use Taiwan as a springboard to attack the Chinese mainland, invade Asia, and enslave the Chinese and Asian people once again. Naturally, these are all their delusions. In order to ensure the integrity of our motherland's territory and sovereignty and safeguard peace in Asia and the world, we must heighten our vigilance, unite as one, work hard, and produce hard, and support the great struggle to liberate Taiwan with practical actions. Comrades! In the past revolutionary struggles and in various tasks after the victory, you have made significant contributions and achievements, and many model individuals have emerged. Over the past year, you have achieved new successes in production and work. For example, according to statistics from 226 counties in thirteen provinces including Hebei, Shaanxi, Rehe, Hubei, Shanxi, and Fujian, more than 60 percent of our families of martyrs, families of servicemen, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized soldiers engaged in construction have participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and many of them have been elected as heads of mutual aid teams, chairpersons of agricultural producers' cooperatives, production models, representatives to people's congresses at all levels, and village cadres. This is the example of the people, this is your glory.
    Comrades! 1955 is a year in which the people of the whole country will continue to struggle to liberate Taiwan, eliminate the Chiang gang, and smash the U.S.-Chiang war treaty. In this struggle, the major victory of liberating Yijiangshan Island has recently been achieved in the coastal areas, and even greater victories will be achieved this year. 1955 is also a year of decisive significance for the construction of our country's first Five-Year Plan. In this year, we must closely unite under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, actively participate in various socialist construction undertakings of the motherland, strictly abide by work posts and labor discipline, respond to the call of the Party and the government, and fight to support the liberation of Taiwan, eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and smash the U.S.-Chiang treaty. Therefore, in addition to preparing for spring plowing, I hope that you will actively participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, work with the masses to do a good job in agricultural production, fulfill the task of increasing production, support the country's socialist industrial construction, assist the government in doing various tasks, and I also hope that you will write letters to your relatives and comrades at the front lines about your production achievements and production plans, encouraging them to strengthen political and military training, learn from the example of the Soviet Red Army, master modern advanced technology, heighten their vigilance, strictly guard their posts, and make greater contributions to the liberation of Taiwan, the defense of the motherland's economic construction, and the cause of peace in Asia and the world.
    Finally, let me wish you greater achievements in all aspects in 1955. And I wish you a happy Spring Festival and good health!

    向全国革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命  残废军人、复员建设军人的春节慰问讲话
    中华人民共和国内务部部长  谢觉哉亲爱的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人同志们！
    一九五五年的春节到来了，我怀着愉快的心情向你们致衷心的祝贺！
    过去的一年，祖国在政治、经济、文化各方面的建设上都取得了巨大的成就。首先在全国范围内完成了普选，召开了地方各级人民代表大会和全国人民代表大会会议，颁布了中华人民共和国宪法，使我国人民民主制度更臻完善，人民民主专政的政权更加巩固。在工业生产和基本建设上，全国新建、改建和续建的重大工业建设项目就有三百多个。全国农业互助合作组织，有了更大的发展，拿农业生产合作社来说，去年秋收以前，全国共有二十二万多个，现在已经增加到了四十多万个。在农业生产上，去年虽然遭受到百年来没有过的洪水，但是由于各级党政领导和广大人民群众一起，进行了英勇的防汛抢救斗争，终于减轻了洪水灾害的损失。人民政府拨出了大批粮款对受灾人民进行救济。全国粮食的总收成仍然比以前有了增加。我国人民的物质生活和文化生活都相应地得到了改善和提高。
    亲爱的同志们！我们祖国所以能够得到这样伟大的成就，是和中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导分不开的，是和革命烈士家属、革命军人家属的亲人——人民解放军在边防、海防线上坚守岗位、保卫祖国的功劳分不开的，是和你们与全国人民的积极参加工矿业生产、参加农业生产和互助合作组织的努力分不开的，是和革命残废军人、复员建设军人曾经在前线上英勇斗争的功劳分不开的。
    同志们！我相信你们和全国人民一样，都为这些成就而感到高兴。但是，美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国贼，很不高兴咱们过这样一天比一天更好的生活，他们不甘心咱们在和平环境中建设一个幸福美满的社会主义社会的国家，他们时时刻刻千方百计地在破坏我们的事业。美帝国主义最近公然和蒋介石卖国贼签订了所谓“共同防御条约”，明目张胆地强占我国的神圣领土台湾。美帝国主义企图以台湾为跳板来进攻中国大陆，侵略亚洲，再次奴役中国人民和亚洲人民。自然，这都是他们的妄想。为了保障我们祖国领土和主权的完整，保卫亚洲和世界和平，我们必须提高警惕，团结一致，努力工作，努力生产，以实际行动来支援解放台湾的伟大斗争。同志们！你们在过去的革命斗争中，在胜利后的各项工作中，曾经做出过重大的贡献和成绩，涌现出许多模范人物。一年来，你们在生产上、工作上又获得了新的成就。比如河北、陕西、热河、湖北、山西、福建等十三个省的二百二十六个县的统计，我们的烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人就有百分之六十以上的人家参加了互助合作组织，其中有许多人当选为互助组长、农业生产合作社社长和生产模范，以及各级人民代表大会代表和乡村干部。这是人民的榜样，这是你们的光荣。
    同志们！一九五五年是全国人民继续为解放台湾、消灭蒋贼、粉碎美蒋战争条约而斗争的一年。在这一斗争中，最近在沿海地区已经取得了解放一江山岛的重大胜利，今年还要取得更大的胜利。一九五五年，也是我国第一个五年计划建设具有决定意义的一年。在这一年中，我们要紧紧地团结在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，积极参加祖国各种社会主义建设事业，严守工作岗位和劳动纪律，响应党和政府的号召，为支援解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团、粉碎美蒋条约而斗争。因此，希望大家除了做好春耕生产准备外，应当积极参加互助合作组织，和群众一道搞好农业生产，完成增产任务，支援国家的社会主义工业建设，协助政府做好各项工作，并且希望把你们的生产成绩和生产计划写信告诉给前方的亲人和战友，鼓励他们加强政治和军事训练，学习苏联红军的榜样，掌握现代化的先进技术，提高警惕，严守岗位，为解放台湾、保卫祖国经济建设和亚洲及世界和平事业，建立更大功勋。
    最后，让我预祝你们于一九五五年内在各方面获得更大的成就。并祝你们春节愉快，身体健康！
