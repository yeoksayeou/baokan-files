Xinhua News Agency Report:

    The autumn grain collection and unified purchase work in many regions is now nearing completion. Grain storage is proceeding intensely. In order to ensure proper storage of the large quantities of new grain, the Ministry of Food recently issued instructions to all levels of grain departments. The instructions require all levels of grain departments to earnestly implement the principle of "prevention is better than cure" and to conscientiously work on reducing grain moisture content, eliminating grain storage pests, and strengthening the security of grain depots.

    The instructions state that the current characteristics of grain storage work are: increased tasks, insufficient warehouses, dispersed storage, a wide variety of grain types, high moisture content in some grains, and a lack of mature experience in storage. Last year, some regions had new grain entering storage with insect infestations, while many regions still had severe insect problems in old grain. At the same time, with the socialist transformation of agriculture and the implementation of unified purchase policies for grain, cotton, and oilseeds, we must be highly vigilant against the possibility of sabotage of granaries and burning of grain by hostile elements. Any complacency is wrong.

    The instructions point out that it is essential to carefully understand the quantity, moisture content, temperature, insect infestation, and storage location of the new grain. Then, for grain that must be stored for a long time and has high moisture content, use existing mechanical power and manpower as needed to spread and air it, ventilate it, or dry it to meet safe storage standards. In addition, reducing the number of storage points can reduce storage difficulties, and while inspecting storage, pay attention to the repair of warehouses.

    The instructions emphasized that during the period of large-scale grain storage, educating farmers to dry and clean the grain thoroughly is of great significance for future grain storage work. Grain departments in all regions should cooperate with relevant departments to continue carrying out this patriotic education for farmers. At the same time, improve the inspection technology of grain quality inspectors. For grain with excessive moisture and impurities, persuade farmers to sort it out on the spot. Inferior grain and good grain, insect-infested grain and insect-free grain, should be stored separately as much as possible to prevent infection. In accepting grain from farmers, a method of "entering storage, inspecting, and sorting" should be adopted.

    The instructions also require grain departments in all regions to carry out pest control work in warehouses. In accordance with the spirit of "treating early, treating little, and treating completely," various pest control measures should be taken for grain with different degrees of insect infestation. Strive to complete the treatment of all insect-infested grain as soon as possible. At the same time, continue to do a good job in cleaning inside and outside the warehouse, further improve the storage environment, eliminate overwintering conditions for warehouse pests, and prevent warehouse pest breeding.

    The instructions also point out that it is necessary to improve and strengthen the granary protection organization and strictly enforce the granary protection system. Ensure that the system is strict and precautions are thorough. In addition, it is also necessary to strengthen the education of the masses around the granary on preventing special agents, preventing theft, and preventing fire, mobilize the masses, and cooperate with relevant departments to do a good job in granary security and fire prevention work.

    粮食部指示要做好新粮保管工作
    据新华社讯：目前很多地区秋粮征收和统购工作已进入结束阶段。粮食入库工作正在紧张进行。为把大批新粮切实保管好，粮食部最近向各级粮食部门发出了指示。指示要求各级粮食部门在正确贯彻“防重于治”的方针下，切实做好降低粮食水分、消灭储粮害虫以及加强粮库保卫等工作。
    指示说，当前粮食保管工作的特点是：任务增大，仓房不足，储粮分散，粮食品种繁多，部分粮食水分大，在保管上还缺乏成熟的经验。去年有些地区新粮带虫入库，而很多地区的陈粮虫害仍较严重。同时，随着农业社会主义改造和实行粮、棉、油料的统购政策，我们对敌对分子破坏粮仓、烧毁粮食的可能，必需有高度的警惕。任何麻痹思想都是错误的。
    指示指出，必需认真了解新粮数量、水分、温度、虫害、以及储粮地点的情况。然后，对必需长期保管而水分又较大的粮食，根据需要，运用现有机械力量和人力，进行摊晾、过风或烘干，以达到储粮安全标准。此外，缩小储粮点面，可以减少保管上的困难，并在检查储粮同时，注意仓房的检修工作。
    指示强调指出，在大批粮食入库时期，教育农民把粮食晒干扬净，对今后粮食保管工作有很大意义。各地粮食部门应配合有关部门继续对农民进行这种爱国主义教育。同时提高粮质检验人员的检验技术，对水分过大杂质过多的粮食，应说服农民就地整理。对次粮和好粮，有虫粮和无虫粮，应尽可能分开储存，以防感染。在接受农民送粮中，并应采取“边入库、边检查、边整理”的方法。
    指示还要求各地粮食部门开展除治仓虫工作。根据“治早、治少、治了”的精神，对不同虫害程度的粮食，采取各种不同除治措施。争取把所有虫粮及早处理完毕。同时，必须继续做好仓内外的清洁卫生工作，进一步改善仓储环境，消灭仓虫越冬条件，防止仓虫繁殖。
    指示还指出，必须健全与巩固护仓组织，严格护仓制度。做到制度严格，防范周到。此外，还必须加强对粮仓周围的群众进行防特务、防盗窃和防火教育，发动群众，配合有关部门做好粮仓治安和防火工作。
