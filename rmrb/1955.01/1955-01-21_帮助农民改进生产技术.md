    Helping Farmers Improve Production Techniques
    The Agricultural Production Cooperative Technical Liaison Group of Nanjing Agricultural College has established regular contact with the Yixin Vegetable Production Cooperative and the Lianzhong Agricultural Production Cooperative in the eight suburban districts of Nanjing, helping farmers solve technical problems in production. A portion of the Yixin Vegetable Production Cooperative's vegetable plots had very hard soil, lacking organic matter, which affected vegetable production increases. Pei Baoyi, a professor in the Department of Soil and Agricultural Chemistry at Nanjing Agricultural College, suggested using garbage to make compost to loosen the soil. The cooperative has decided to use the winter slack season to organize manpower to transport garbage from the city to make compost, with a plan to improve soil properties. The cooperative's seedling-raising hotbeds were poorly constructed, so Cao Shouchun, a lecturer in the Department of Agronomy, assisted the cooperative in a hotbed seedling-raising demonstration, helping the cooperative change the structure of the hotbeds so that the temperature inside the bed could be consistent and germination uniform. Cao Shouchun also introduced the method of transplanting seedlings in cow dung pots, which made the seedlings grow strong. The technical liaison group is also conducting zoning land work for the Lianzhong Agricultural Production Cooperative, so that the cooperative can reasonably plan production, rationally use land, and organize labor.
    This technical liaison group was established in October of last year, composed of eleven professors, associate professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants from the Departments of Agronomy, Plant Protection, Soil and Agricultural Chemistry, Agricultural Economics, and Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine.

    帮助农民改进生产技术
    南京农学院的农业生产合作社技术联系小组，和南京市郊八区一心蔬菜生产合作社、联众农业生产合作社建立了经常的联系，帮助农民解决生产上的技术问题。一心蔬菜生产合作社有一部分菜地的土质很坚硬，缺乏有机质，影响蔬菜增产。南京农学院土壤农化系教授裴保义便建议用垃圾做堆肥，以疏松土质。社里已决定利用冬闲时间，组织人力到城里运垃圾做堆肥，有计划地改良土壤性质。该社育苗的温床构造不好，农学系讲师曹寿椿便协助该社做了一次温床育苗示范，帮助社里改变了温床的构造，使床内温度能够一致，发芽整齐。曹寿椿还介绍了牛粪钵的移苗方法，使菜苗生长健壮。技术联系小组也正在为联众农业生产合作社进行区划土地工作，使合作社能够合理计划生产，合理使用土地和组织劳动力。
    这个技术联系小组是去年十月份成立的，由农学系、植物保护系、土壤农化系、农业经济系和畜牧兽医系的教授、副教授、讲师、助教共十一人组成。
