To the Editor:

In promoting goods for the fourth quarter, some financial and economic cadres in our county's districts and townships are only simplistically pursuing the percentage of task completion. They neither actively conduct extensive and in-depth publicity to farmers nor cater to the needs of the masses. Instead, they use simple, crude, and coercive methods to forcibly distribute some industrial products to farmers. For example, the cadres promoting goods in Rentuo Township sent nine meters of woolen cloth, three jackets, four pounds of wool yarn, two blankets, two raincoats, and two dozens of socks to a poor peasant. However, they did not sell him the cotton wadding and cotton cloth that the farmer urgently needed. The Qingbo Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative in the Thirteenth District forcibly allocated 1.8 million yuan worth of goods to Tian Xiangru, a village cadre whose family only consisted of two people, including six washbasins, a dozen toothbrushes and toothpastes each, and more than forty pencils... Even more serious is that the Miaoji Township Supply and Marketing Station actually told farmers to use People's Bank savings certificates as currency to buy goods, and collected more than 2 million yuan in certificates in one day.

The above practices reflect the serious simplistic task-oriented view of some financial and economic cadres. They only emphasize completing individual tasks and disregard the needs of the masses. If such practices do not arouse vigilance and are not corrected in various regions, they will harm the enthusiasm of the masses for production. I hope that areas with similar situations will also pay attention to preventing and correcting this phenomenon.

### 推销商品不能强迫摊派

    推销商品不能强迫摊派编辑同志：
    我县部分区乡的财经工作干部在推销第四季度商品中，只单纯追求完成任务的百分比，既不积极地向农民进行广泛深入的宣传，又不根据群众需要，而是用简单粗暴、强迫命令的办法，硬把一些工业品分配给农民。如仁沱乡推销商品的干部给一个贫农送去呢子九公尺、夹克衣三件、毛线四磅、毯子二床、雨衣二件、袜子两打等；但对这个农民所迫切需要的棉絮、棉布等却没有卖给。十三区清泊乡供销社硬给全家只有两口人的村干部田相如配了一百八十万元的商品，包括六个脸盆，牙刷、牙膏各一打，铅笔四十多支……。情况更加严重的是：庙基乡供销站竟叫农民拿人民银行的存单当货币来买商品，有一天就收了二百多万元的存单。
    以上这些作法，反映了某些财经干部单纯任务观点是严重的。他们只强调完成个人任务，不顾群众需要，这种作法如不引起各地警惕并加以纠正，就会伤害群众生产的积极性。我希望有类似情况的地区也注意防止和纠正这种现象。
