Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 12th: The Vietnam News Agency reported from Hanoi on the 11th that the National Congress of the Vietnam National United Front held a special meeting on January 9 to oppose American interference in Vietnam. Five hundred representatives from all walks of life in Hanoi attended the meeting.

　　Le Dinh Tham, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front and Chairman of the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace, delivered a report at the meeting, focusing on exposing the activities of the United States in undermining the Geneva Accords. Le Dinh Tham pointed out that after the signing of the Geneva Accords, the United States concluded the aggressive Southeast Asia Treaty and included South Vietnam within the scope of this treaty. American General Collins announced that the United States would train and equip the Ngo Dinh Diem puppet army, and the United States supported the Ngo Dinh Diem group in persecuting the people of South Vietnam.

　　Le Dinh Tham finally called on the Vietnamese people to expand their united front in order to consolidate peace and thwart all conspiracies of US imperialism and its running dogs.

　　The meeting also heard two reports on the situation of the Saigon and Cholon peace movement in South Vietnam and the Ngo Dinh Diem group's illegal arrest of peace fighters. The meeting unanimously passed a resolution protesting against US imperialism's sabotage of the Geneva Accords, demanding that the other party immediately stop persecuting and retaliating against those who had participated in the war of resistance, guaranteeing the democratic freedoms of the people of South Vietnam, and releasing the peace advocates arrested by Ngo Dinh Diem.
