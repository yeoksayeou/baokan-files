(TASS, Moscow, 20th) The Central Statistical Bureau of the Council of Ministers of the USSR has released a communiqué on the results of the implementation of the National Economic Development Plan of the USSR for 1954.

The communiqué states that the overall plan for the gross output of Soviet industry in 1954 was fulfilled by 103 percent. The total industrial output in 1954 increased by 13 percent compared to 1953, and by 65 percent compared to 1950. This growth, and the further increase in industrial production stipulated in the 1955 plan, can guarantee the early completion of the task set by the Fifth Five-Year Plan to increase industrial production by approximately 70 percent in 1955 compared to 1950.

The communiqué then discussed the development of Soviet agriculture. In 1954, the sown area of various spring crops was expanded by 10.8 million hectares compared to 1953. The sown area of cotton, sugar beet, potatoes, vegetables, and other crops was expanded. Despite unfavorable climatic conditions in southern Ukraine and the Volga River basin, the actual grain harvest and the amount of grain procured and purchased increased compared to 1953. Collective farms and state farms completed the state grain procurement and purchase plans ahead of schedule. By December 5, 1954, 271 million poods more grain had been sold and delivered to the state than in the same period in 1953.

The communiqué published materials on the development of basic construction. At the same time, the statistics listed in the communiqué show that trade in the Soviet Union further developed last year. In terms of foreign trade, the Soviet Union continued to expand its economic ties with foreign countries in 1954. Last year, the Soviet Union traded with fifty-six countries.

As in the past, there were no unemployed people in the Soviet Union in 1954. The number of employees in the Soviet national economy was approximately 47 million at the end of 1954, two million more than at the end of 1953.

The material welfare and cultural life of the Soviet people were further improved in 1954. In 1954, the national income of the Soviet Union increased by 11 percent compared to 1953. The measures implemented in 1954 to reduce state retail prices of consumer goods directly benefited residents by 20 billion rubles in one year.

Various sectors of socialist culture also achieved further successes in 1954.

The results of the implementation of the National Economic Development Plan of the USSR in 1954 prove the continuous growth of the socialist economy and show that the Soviet Union's five-year development plan from 1950 to 1955 is being successfully implemented, and many important sectors of the national economy are overfulfilling this plan.

    苏联部长会议中央统计局
    发布去年经济计划执行结果公报
    【本报讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十日讯：苏联部长会议中央统计局发布了关于一九五四年苏联发展国民经济国家计划的执行结果的公报。
    公报说，一九五四年苏联工业全年总产量计划整个说来完成了百分之一百零三。一九五四年工业的总产量比一九五三年增加了百分之十三，比一九五零年增加了百分之六十五。这种增长和一九五五年计划所规定的工业生产的进一步的增加，可以保证提前完成第五个五年计划所规定的在一九五五年把工业生产量比一九五零年约增加百分之七十的任务。
    公报接着谈到苏联农业的发展。一九五四年，各种春播作物的播种面积比一九五三年扩大了一千零八十万公顷。棉花、甜菜、马铃薯、蔬菜和其他作物的播种面积扩大了。尽管乌克兰南部和伏尔加河流域的气候条件不好，谷物的实际收获量以及征购和收购量比一九五三年增加了。集体农庄和国营农场提前完成了国家征购和收购粮食的计划。到一九五四年十二月五日为止，向国家交售和出售的粮食比一九五三年同一时期多二亿七千一百万普特。
    公报公布了关于基本建设发展情况的材料。同时，公报中列举的统计数字表明：去年，苏联的贸易有了进一步的发展。在对外贸易方面，苏联一九五四年继续和外国扩大了经济联系。去年，苏联和五十六个国家进行了贸易。
    同过去一样，一九五四年苏联没有失业的人。苏联国民经济中职工的数目到一九五四年年底约为四千七百万人，比一九五三年年底多两百万人。
    苏联人民的物质福利和文化生活水平在一九五四年得到了进一步的提高。一九五四年，苏联的国民收入比一九五三年增加了百分之十一。一九五四年所施行的降低人民消费品的国家零售价格的措施，在一年中给予了居民二百亿卢布的直接利益。
    社会主义文化各部门在一九五四年也获得了进一步的成就。
    一九五四年苏联发展国民经济国家计划的执行结果，证明了社会主义经济不断增涨，并且表明，苏联从一九五○年到一九五五年的五年发展计划正在顺利地执行中，而国民经济的许多重要部门正在超额完成这个计划。
