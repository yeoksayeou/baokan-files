The Finance Department of the Hegang Coal Mining Bureau thoroughly reviewed the procurement plan, saving 7 billion yuan in procurement funds for the first quarter. In previous years, the procurement of equipment and materials needed by the mine in the first quarter was always done by ordering first and planning later, which often resulted in the ordered materials being either insufficient or surplus, seriously tying up state funds. This year, the mine's Finance Department learned from past lessons and took the initiative to go to various mines to review the material usage plan for the first quarter. The Nanshan Mine originally planned to need 3,000 meters of ventilation duct, but after review, only 2,000 meters were needed, saving nearly 30 million yuan. The most prominent thing was the inventory of pit props. After review, the year-end statistics showed that the inventory value had increased by nearly 4.7 billion yuan compared with the previous year. This avoided the backlog of pit props and saved funds. Through this review, the order plan for the first quarter was reduced by 7.003 billion yuan, laying the foundation for reserve fund management.

    认真审查采购计划节约资金七十亿
    鹤岗煤矿矿务局财务处深入审查采购计划，节约首季采购资金七十亿元。往年该矿第一季度需用器材的采购工作都是订货在先，计划在后，因此往往造成已订的材料不是不足就是多余，严重的积压了国家资金。今年该矿财务处接受过去教训，主动深入各矿审查第一季度用料计划。南山矿原计划需要风筒三千公尺，审查后只需二千公尺就够了，节约了近三千万元。最突出的是坑木库存数量，经审查后年末统计库存价值竟较前增加了近四十七亿元，这样就避免了坑木的积压，节约了资金。通过这次审查使第一季度订货计划减少了七十亿零三千万元，为储备资金管理打下了基础。
