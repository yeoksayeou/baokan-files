Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 15th: The following is the full text of the Soviet government's statement on the German question:

Recently, the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) have been doing everything possible to get the Paris Agreements ratified. In doing so, they do not consider the adverse consequences that such ratification will bring to the people of Europe and the cause of world peace.

The Soviet government considers it necessary to reiterate that the Paris Agreements, which provide for the remilitarization of West Germany, are greatly complicating the entire European situation. This is not only the opinion of the Soviet government, but also of the governments of Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, and the People's Republic of China, and some other countries. As is well known, even in those countries whose governments support the Paris Agreements, the majority of the people are against them.

If these agreements are ratified, West Germany will be remilitarized, and the Federal Republic of Germany will be drawn into military blocs such as the Western European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Not only the Soviet Union, but also many other European and non-European countries believe that the Western European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are aggressive military blocs, and that the Federal Republic of Germany's joining these military blocs, which are directed against the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries, will increase the threat of a new war in Europe.

The Paris Agreements also cannot bring any benefit to Germany and the German people. On the contrary, these agreements, which aim to restore militarism in West Germany, will ultimately drag the Federal Republic of Germany into adventurous plans for preparing a new war, which have always been, and will continue to be, contrary to the interests of all peoples—including the German people.

The Paris Agreements run counter to the interests of the German people, especially because they will keep Germany divided for a long time and will become an obstacle to the peaceful reunification of Germany. It is quite obvious that it is impossible to unite the peace-loving German Democratic Republic with a militarized Federal Republic of Germany that has been dragged into military blocs. Ratifying the Paris Agreements is incompatible with making Germany a unified, peace-loving country again.

Recently, in the Federal Republic of Germany, as well as in the United Kingdom, France, and some other countries, some people have been spreading the argument that ratifying the Paris Agreements will not only not hinder, but will even help to negotiate on the German question and other outstanding international issues.

The Soviet government has pointed out that this statement is completely unfounded and can only mislead public opinion. This argument is being spread in order to get the parliaments of some countries to ratify the Paris Agreements as quickly as possible at all costs. It is being spread by those in Western countries who regard the restoration of German militarism as their primary task, and who are willing to sacrifice the reunification of Germany for this purpose.

In view of the position taken by the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France—a position that violates their obligations to restore the unity of Germany and make it a peace-loving, democratic state—the unification of Germany now depends primarily on the Germans themselves, on the position of the German people.

It is known that the West German Bundestag is scheduled to conduct a final review of the Paris Agreements in February. The future of Germany depends to a large extent on the decision of the Bundestag, which has been clearly recognized by the largest parties and trade unions in West Germany that are closer to the people and closer to the German working class and oppose the ratification of the Paris Agreements. If the Paris Agreements are ratified, the Bundestag will bear a serious responsibility for the continued division of Germany and the long-term subordination of the people of the Federal Republic of Germany.

At present, there are still unexploited possibilities for reaching an agreement on the reunification of Germany while properly taking into account the legitimate interests of the German people and holding free all-German elections for this purpose in 1955, provided that the main obstacles to the reunification of Germany—the plans to remilitarize West Germany and to join it to military blocs—are eliminated.

The German people must be given the opportunity to freely express their will through free general elections held throughout Germany (including Berlin), so that a united Germany can once again become a great power and gain its rightful place among other great powers.

It must be ensured that German citizens can enjoy democratic rights in this election. The electoral law for this election, formulated with due regard to the electoral laws of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, must ensure that all voters can freely express their will, and that every democratic party and organization can freely conduct election campaigns throughout Germany, and can freely nominate candidates and submit candidate lists.

In order to facilitate agreement on holding the above-mentioned elections, the Soviet government believes that it is possible to negotiate on the establishment of appropriate international supervision over the holding of all-German elections, if the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agree to do so.

In this regard, no part of Germany should be bound by any clause of a unilateral agreement that would make it participate in a military alliance.

The Soviet government believes that the question of the future state system of a united Germany should be decided by the German people themselves, and that the task of other countries is to help Germany move definitively towards the path of peace and democratic development.

Holding free all-German elections and restoring the unity of Germany will also create the necessary preconditions for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, which will finally consolidate the independence, sovereignty, and equality of a united Germany. A peace treaty with Germany will entitle a united Germany to have the national armed forces necessary to ensure the security of Germany and its borders.

The German people must choose the path of future development.

One path leads to the restoration of German unity and the establishment of normal relations with all European countries. This path prevents both East and West Germany from participating in military blocs directed against other countries, and the best way to ensure this is to allow Germany to participate in a European collective security system.

The other path—the path that the Paris Agreements are dragging it along—is the path of fixing the division of Germany and restoring militarism in West Germany, and leading it to participate in plans to prepare a new war. There is no doubt that the vast majority of the German people are against this path of militarization, against this path of hopeless new war adventures. This is a path that Germany has taken more than once, and it will only bring new and greater disasters to the German people.

Unlike the militaristic path that Germany has taken in the past, the path of German reunification and participation in the European collective security system will bring extremely good prospects for the high tide of Germany's peaceful economy and the development of its industry, for the development of broad economic relations between Germany and other countries—especially the development of relations with Eastern European countries and Asian countries with large populations and endless resources. Such development of Germany in peaceful conditions and the maintenance of broad economic ties with other countries will give its industry the broad market it desperately needs, guarantee employment for the population, and raise the living standards of the German people.

Such a path of development for Germany is in line with both the national interests of the German people and the interests of strengthening peace in Europe and world peace.

Based on the above, the Soviet government has come to the following conclusions:

First, the most important and urgent issue for solving the German question is the issue of restoring German unity. In order to solve this problem, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union must hold negotiations on the issue of restoring German unity through free all-German elections.

Second, the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic have good relations. The Soviet government is also willing to normalize relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany.

Under the current circumstances, the normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany may at the same time help to promote better understanding with each other and to seek more effective ways to resolve the issue of restoring German unity.

Third, if the Paris Agreements are ratified, then a new situation will arise, that is to say, the Soviet Union will inevitably not only further strengthen its friendly relations with the German Democratic Republic, but also strengthen peace and security in Europe through the joint efforts of peace-loving European countries.

    苏联关于德国问题的声明
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十五日电：下面是苏联政府关于德国问题的声明的全文：
    近来美国、英国、法国以及德意志联邦共和国（西德）的政府一直在尽一切力量使巴黎协定获得批准。它们在这样做的时候并不考虑这种批准将带给欧洲各国人民和世界和平事业以怎样不利的后果。
    苏联政府认为有必要再度指出：规定西德重新军国主义化的巴黎协定正在使整个欧洲局势大大复杂化。这不仅是苏联政府的意见，也是波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚以及中华人民共和国和其他一些国家的政府的意见。如所周知，甚至在那些政府是支持巴黎协定的国家里，大多数人民也都是反对巴黎协定的。
    如果这些协定被批准的话，西德将重新军国主义化，德意志联邦共和国将被拉入西欧军事联盟和北大西洋集团之类的军事集团中。
    不仅苏联，还有很多其他欧洲国家和非欧洲国家也都认为，西欧联盟和北大西洋集团是侵略性的军事集团，认为德意志联邦共和国加入这些针对着苏联和其他爱好和平的国家的军事集团将增加欧洲发生新战争的威胁。
      巴黎协定也不能带给德国和德国人民什么好处。相反地，这些目的在于在西德恢复军国主义的协定最后将把德意志联邦共和国拉进准备新战争的冒险计划，这种计划一向是、并且今后也是不符合各国人民——包括德国人民在内——的利益的。
      巴黎协定是和德国人民的利益背道而驰的，特别是因为它将使德国长期处于分裂状态，而且将成为和平恢复德国统一的障碍。十分明显，要把爱好和平的德意志民主共和国和被拖入军事集团的、军国主义化的德意志联邦共和国统一起来是不可能的。批准巴黎协定和使德国重新成为一个统一的、爱好和平的国家是不相容的。
      最近在德意志联邦共和国以及英国、法国和其他一些国家中有人散布一种论调，硬说批准巴黎协定不但不会阻碍、甚至还会有助于就德国问题和其他悬而未决的国际问题进行谈判。
      苏联政府已经指出，这种说法是完全没有根据的，只能迷惑舆论。散布这种论调，是为了不惜一切代价使一些国家的议会赶快批准巴黎协定。正在散布这种论调的是西方国家中的这样一些人，他们把恢复德国军国主义当作他们的首要任务，并且不惜为此牺牲德国的重新统一。
      鉴于美国、英国和法国政府采取这种立场——这种立场违反它们所承担的恢复德国的统一使它成为一个爱好和平的、民主的国家的义务，现在，德国的统一首先取决于德国人自己，取决于德国人民的立场。
      大家知道，西德联邦议院预定在二月间就巴黎协定进行最后的审议。德国的将来在很大程度上取决于联邦议院的决定，这一点，西德的那些比较接近人民、比较接近德国工人阶级的、反对批准巴黎协定的最大的党派和工会已经清楚地认识到了。如果巴黎协定获得批准，联邦议院将对德国继续处于分裂状态以及德意志联邦共和国人民的长期处于从属地位负有严重的责任。
    目前，在就恢复德国统一问题达成协议而适当地照顾到德国人民的正当利益和为此在一九五五年举行全德自由选举方面，仍然还有没有加以利用的可能性，这样的可能性是存在的，假使消除妨碍恢复德国统一的主要障碍——使西德重新军国主义化和使它加入军事集团的计划——的话。
    必须使德国人民有机会通过在全德（包括柏林）举行自由的普选的办法来自由地表示他们的意愿，使一个统一的德国重新成为一个大国，并且取得它在其他大国中间的正当地位。
    必须保证在这次选举中德国公民能够享受民主权利。在适当照顾德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国的选举法的情况下制定的关于这次选举的选举法，必须保证全体选民能够自由地表示他们的意愿，保证每一个民主党派和组织能够在全德自由地进行竞选运动，能够自由地提名候选人和提出候选人名单。
    为了便于在举行上述选举方面达成协议，苏联政府认为，就对举行全德选举建立适当的国际监督问题进行谈判是可能的，如果德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国同意这样做的话。
    在这方面，德国的任何一部分都不应该受到使它参加军事联盟的片面协定的任何条款的约束。
    苏联政府认为，关于一个统一的德国的未来的国家制度问题，应该由德国人民自己来决定，而其他国家的任务是协助德国肯定地走向和平和民主发展的道路。
    举行全德自由选举和恢复德国的统一也将为缔结一项对德和约创造必要的先决条件，这样一项和约将最后巩固一个统一的德国的独立、主权和平等。对德和约将使统一的德国有权拥有保障德国的安全和它的边境所必需的国家武装部队。
    德国人民必须就今后发展的途径进行选择。
    一条道路是导向恢复德国统一并且和一切欧洲国家建立正常关系的道路。这条道路使东德和西德都不能参加针对其他国家的军事集团，能保证这一点的最好的办法就是让德国参加一个欧洲集体安全体系。
    另一条道路——巴黎协定正在拖它走的道路——是使德国的分裂局面固定化和在西德恢复军国主义的道路，是把它引向参加准备新战争的计划的道路。毫无疑问，绝大多数德国人民反对这条军国主义化的道路，反对这条进行没有希望的新的战争冒险的道路。这是德国不止一次走过的道路，它只会给德国人民带来新的、更加巨大的灾难。
    和德国在过去走的军国主义道路不同，德国重新统一和参加欧洲集体安全体系的道路，将为德国和平经济的高涨和它的工业的发展、为发展德国和其他国家——特别是发展和东欧国家以及拥有众多人口和无尽资源的亚洲国家——之间的广泛经济关系带来极其良好的前景。德国在和平条件下取得这样的发展和同其他国家保持广泛的经济联系，将使它的工业得到它极其需要的广阔市场，保证居民的就业，提高德国人民的生活水平。
    德国的这样一条发展道路既符合德国人民的民族利益，又符合加强欧洲和平和世界和平的利益。
    根据以上所述，苏联政府得出如下的结论：
    一、对解决德国问题来说，最重要和迫切需要解决的就是恢复德国统一的问题。为了解决这个问题，美、英、法、苏之间必须就通过全德自由选举来恢复德国统一的问题举行谈判。
    二、苏联和德意志民主共和国有良好的关系。苏联政府同样愿意使苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间的关系正常化。
    在目前的情况下，苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间关系的正常化同时可能有助于促进彼此较好的谅解和寻求更有效的解决恢复德国统一问题的办法。
    三、如果巴黎协定被批准，那末，就将产生一种新的局势，就是说，苏联将势必不但要进一步加强和德意志民主共和国的友好关系，而且要通过同爱好和平的欧洲国家的共同努力来加强欧洲的和平和安全。
                      一九五五年一月十五日
