On a snowy night at the end of last year, we boarded the new "Minzhong" passenger ship heading up the Yangtze River and sailed into Yichang Port.

We walked onto the dock, passed through the riverside warehouses and storage areas, and saw stevedores busily moving goods. Here were steel billets and steel materials from Anshan, and pig iron from the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River; fabrics and general merchandise shipped from Shanghai, ready to be transported to various places upstream of the Yangtze River; and hundreds of thousands of tons of grain shipped from Sichuan, ready to be transshipped from here to disaster-stricken rural areas, large cities, and industrial and mining areas.

The person leading us to visit Yichang Port told us: Due to the different navigation conditions and ship types in various sections of the Yangtze River, materials transported eastward along the river in the southwest region and materials transported from the inland to the southwest have always been transshipped in Yichang. The development of Yangtze River shipping can be seen from the changes in cargo handling at Yichang Port. Originally, the cargo throughput of Yichang Port in 1954 was more than 2.2 million tons, an increase of more than five times compared with the largest year before liberation. The year 1954 was the fifth bumper harvest year in Sichuan Province after liberation, and the amount of grain transported out along the Yangtze River increased by more than 300,000 tons compared with 1953. Usually, every night, thirty or so ships come to Yichang from the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. At most, there are fifty or sixty ships.

Traveling upstream along the Yangtze River from Yichang, we encountered groups of ships speeding past. These ships were fully loaded with grain, local products, and special products heading downstream to Yichang. The noisy sound of the ship's horns stirred up lasting echoes in the Three Gorges. The crew members said: "Seeing that the Sichuan River transportation is busier year after year, more than twenty small market towns that used to be deserted on both the north and south banks have now been converted into new docks. Some docks cannot even be found on the map yet!" The old captain, Mo Jiarui, gazed at the shining night navigation beacons in the distance and told us: "Before liberation, every year when the dry season came, larger freighters and passenger ships on the Sichuan River would stop sailing, and goods would be stockpiled in various ports and unable to be transported out. Now, with these navigation beacons guiding the waterway, cargo ship fleets can also rush to sail early and late. In this way, one and a half more shipments of goods can be transported between Yichang and Chongqing in a month."

    夜过宜昌港
    新华社记者　冯健　马光
    在去年年末一个大雪纷飞的夜晚，我们乘坐着上溯长江的“民众”号新型客轮，驶进了宜昌港。
    我们走上码头，穿过傍江的货栈和仓库区，就看到装卸工人们正在紧张地搬运货物。这里有来自鞍山的钢坯、钢材和来自长江中下游的生铁；有从上海运来准备运往长江上游各地的布匹和百货；还有从四川运来的几十万吨粮食，正准备由这里转运到灾区农村、大城市和工矿地区。
    引领我们参观宜昌港的人对我们说：由于长江各段航道条件和船型不同，西南地区沿江东运和内地运往西南的物资历来都在宜昌转运。从宜昌港货运变化的情况就可看出长江航运的发展。原来，一九五四年宜昌港的货物吞吐量有二百几十万吨，比解放前最大的一年增加了五倍以上。一九五四年是四川省解放后的第五个丰收年，沿长江外运的粮食就比一九五三年增多了三十多万吨。平常，每天夜晚从长江上游和中、下游来到宜昌的船队要有三十来艘，最多的时候，有五、六十艘。
    从宜昌沿江上行，我们又遇到成群的船队从身旁疾驶而过。这些船只满载着粮食、土产、特产顺流开往宜昌。喧闹的汽笛声在三峡中激起历久不息的回响。船员们说：“眼看着川江运输一年忙似一年，南北两岸有二十多个原来冷冷清清的小集镇，如今也都辟成新码头了。有些码头甚至在地图上现在还找不到哩！”老船长莫家瑞瞭望着远方闪耀的夜航灯标，告诉我们：“解放前，年年一到枯水季节，川江较大的货轮、客轮就停航了，货物积压在各港运不出去。如今有这导航标指引航道，货运船队也能起早摸黑赶航了。这样，宜昌、重庆间一月就能多运货一次半了”。
