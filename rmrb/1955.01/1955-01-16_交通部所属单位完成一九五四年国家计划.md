Units under the Ministry of Communications Complete the 1954 National Plan

The transportation enterprises and capital construction units under the Ministry of Communications of the People's Republic of China have completed the 1954 national plan. Based on the task completion status of the state-owned, joint state-private, and private transportation industries organized by the Ministry of Communications from January to November, and the plan implementation status in December, the cargo turnover completed by the Yangtze River and Northeast inland rivers is expected to reach 101.74% of the annual plan. The Hankou-Yichang liner service has been changed from a six-day schedule to a five-day schedule, increasing one voyage per ship per month, and the entire line of passenger and cargo ships can increase by more than 6.49 million ton-kilometers. Due to the addition of barges towed by many ships in the Sichuan River transportation, the deadweight utilization rate has increased from 62.83% in May to 70.59%. The cargo turnover of coastal transportation is expected to reach 106.4% of the annual plan. In particular, the Northern Shipping Line north of Ningbo Port has further shortened the turnaround time of ships. The berthing time of Shanghai Port's national flag ocean vessels has been reduced. The average berthing time for each ocean vessel has decreased from 43.9 hours in January of last year to 23.3 hours after October. Improvements in port loading and unloading work have directly promoted the improvement of ship sailing rates, average speeds, and unit output. The Shanghai Maritime Transport Bureau had already completed the annual national plan ahead of schedule on December 10th of last year.

According to statistics from 44 capital construction units in the highway, navigation engineering, and river-sea transportation systems of the Ministry of Communications, based on the capital construction progress from January to November and the task completion status in December, it is expected to reach 99.6% of last year's capital construction plan. The absolute number of total investment completed has increased, and the progress of the project has also accelerated. Among them, highway construction accounts for the largest proportion. The total length of newly built, reconstructed, and restored highways throughout the year can reach 3,112 kilometers. The total mileage of open highways nationwide has reached more than 140,000 kilometers. The completion of major highway projects is relatively good. For example, the Kangzang and Qingzang highways were opened to traffic in December. The South China Highway completed its task in November. The Chengdu-Aba Highway in Sichuan Province also overfulfilled its annual plan in November. In terms of navigation construction, the reform of navigation marks on the Sichuan River was completed, allowing night navigation on the Sichuan River.

At present, although the units under the Ministry of Communications have completed the 1954 national plan, the imbalance in river-sea transportation still exists, and the poor construction management, low quality, and design lagging behind construction in capital construction have not been completely changed. The Ministry of Communications has instructed its affiliated units to seize the first quarter's transportation plan and the initial construction deployment of capital construction; and requires, with the assistance of cargo owner departments, to effectively grasp the transportation plans of major materials such as coal, grain, timber, steel, and oil, and to try to avoid the occurrence of insufficient cargo supply and ship waiting for cargo in the first quarter, so as to implement the annual plan in a balanced manner; strengthen the design institutions of existing capital construction projects of various types, fully prepare for pre-construction work, and deeply promote planned management to improve project quality and construction speed.

    交通部所属单位完成一九五四年国家计划
    中华人民共和国交通部所属各运输企业和基本建设单位，已完成了一九五四年的国家计划。根据所属国营、公私合营以及交通部所组织的私营运输业一至十一月份完成任务和十二月份执行计划的情况看，长江、东北内河完成的货运周转量可达年计划的百分之一百零一点七四。汉口至宜昌班轮已由六天班期改为五天班期，每月每船可增加一个航次，全线客货轮可增加六百四十九万多吨公里。川江运输由于不少轮舶增拖了驳船，载重量运用率已由五月份的百分之六十二点八三，提高到百分之七十点五九。沿海运输的货运周转量可达年计划的百分之一百零六点四。特别是宁波口以北的北洋线，已进一步缩短了船舶周转时间。上海港本国籍海轮停泊时间已有减少。平均每一海轮所停泊的时间，已由去年一月份的四十三点九小时，降低为十月份以后的二十三点三小时。由于港口装卸工作有了改进，就直接促进了船舶航行率、平均航速和单位产量的提高。上海海运局已于去年十二月十日就提前完成了全年的国家计划。
    根据交通部公路、航务工程、以及江海运输系统四十四个基本建设单位的统计，一至十一月份基本建设进度和十二月份完成任务的情况看，可达去年基本建设计划的百分之九十九点六。完成投资总额的绝对数字已有增长，工程进度也加快了。其中占最大比重的是公路建设，全年新建改建和恢复的公路线可达三千一百十二公里。全国公路的通车里程已达十四万多公里。主要的公路工程完成计划任务都比较好。像康藏、青藏公路已于十二月间通车。华南公路已于十一月间完成了任务。四川省的成阿公路也已于十一月间超额完成了年度计划。在航务建设方面完成了川江航标改革的工作，使川江可以在夜间通航。
    目前，交通部所属各单位虽已完成了一九五四年的国家计划。但是江海运输中不均衡的状态依然存在，基本建设中施工管理不善、质量不高和设计落后于施工的状态尚未完全改变。交通部已指示所属各单位，抓紧第一季度的运输计划和基本建设的年初施工部署；并要求在货主部门的协助下，切实掌握主要物资如煤炭、粮食、木材、钢铁、石油等的运输计划，尽力避免第一季度货源不足船舶待货停航等情况的发生，以均衡地执行年度计划；加强现有的各类基本建设工程的设计机构，充分做好施工前的准备工作，深入推行计划管理，以提高工程质量和施工速度。　（张启宗）
