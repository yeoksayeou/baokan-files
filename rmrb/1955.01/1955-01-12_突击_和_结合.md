    "Blitz" and "Integration"
    Shao Xing
    In Nan Shimen Township, Xingtai County, Hebei Province, there are four newly established agricultural producers' cooperatives. The framework has been set up, and the members are actively evaluating the means of production (land, draught animals, and large farm tools). At this crucial moment, the district cadres who came to the township issued the following order: "Now concentrate our efforts on grain work, and the establishment of cooperatives must be stopped immediately!"

    In Maluji, Pingxiang County, many farmers signed up to join the cooperative, but the cadres of the work team sent by the county party committee there did not allow them to sign up, saying: "Wait until the unified purchase and sale of grain is over!"

    The comrades who do this believe that grain work is time-sensitive and must be completed; the establishment of cooperatives and production work can be postponed. They say: "We are not afraid of a blitz, but we are afraid of integration."

    Using this "blitz" method to complete "blitz tasks" can only lead to the following results: sometimes superficially "completing" tasks that can be calculated in numbers; however, not only has it failed to raise the consciousness of the masses through their own work, but it has also created a bad political influence among the masses. Sometimes, they directly run into snags, and it is difficult to "complete" the numerical tasks. For example, if the unified purchase and sale of grain is not combined with mutual aid and cooperation, it will lose the forces it can rely on, and if it is not combined with production, it will make it difficult for the masses to understand the relationship between unified purchase and sale and production, and it will not eliminate their doubts. In particular, when the ideological activities of the masses are concentrated on the evaluation of the means of production for joining the cooperative, which is closely related to their personal interests, and the ideological struggle is tense, suddenly interrupting their activities and conducting "blitz" work in isolation will only increase their doubts. In this case, the "blitz task" is difficult to complete smoothly.

    Is "integration" as "terrible" as some comrades imagine? Looking at the situation in Donglijiazhuang Township in Nangong County and Ying'er Village in Baixiang County, we can see the answer. Donglijiazhuang Township made an overall arrangement for the work, under the unified leadership of the township party branch secretary, with township cadres responsible for their respective tasks. They treated the publicity and education work of unified purchase and sale and the development and consolidation of new cooperatives as inseparable tasks. At the same time, they used the cooperative network to drive production work and purchase work. As most of the masses' ideological concerns about building cooperatives and unified purchase were eliminated, their socialist consciousness was raised, and the original cooperatives played a leading role. As a result, the evaluation of the means of production for ten new cooperatives and three expanded cooperatives was completed smoothly, the autumn ploughing work of the whole township was also completed, and the grain purchase task may be overfulfilled.

    Ying'er Village also made unified arrangements for various tasks by the party branch, centered on mutual aid and cooperative organizations, organizing the masses to discuss the policy of unified purchase and sale and production plans. Three-quarters of the farmers in the village joined the cooperative, and the enthusiasm for mutual aid and cooperation, production enthusiasm, and grain selling enthusiasm rose simultaneously. By formulating production plans, the grain production situation in the whole village was quickly clarified. The originally allocated grain purchase task was more than 34,000 jin, but now it is calculated that there can be a surplus of more than 53,000 jin. The work of cultivating land and accumulating fertilizer is progressing well. The evaluation of the livestock and farm tools of the new members has also been completed smoothly. The organization of the cooperative's production team, the division of the cultivated area, and the matching of livestock and farm tools of each team are also proceeding smoothly.

    From this, it can be seen that overall planning and comprehensive arrangements can "integrate" many tasks and achieve the effect of mutual supervision and mutual promotion. "Blitzing" one thing and abandoning others is a lazy approach and must be overcome and opposed.

    “突击”和“结合”
    邵星
    河北省邢台县南石门乡有四个新建的农业生产合作社，已经搭好了架子，社员们正在积极进行评议生产资料（土地、耕畜、大农具）的工作。正在这种紧要时候，来到乡里的区干部，却下了这样的命令：“现在集中力量搞粮食工作，建社工作马上停止！”
    平乡县马路集有许多农民报名要求入社，驻在那里的县委派出的工作组的干部却不许他们报名，说：“等到统购统销工作结束以后再说！”
    这样做的同志们认为：粮食工作是有时间性的，不完成不行；建社工作和生产工作往后边推推不要紧。他们说：“不怕突击，只怕结合。”
    他们用这种“突击”的方法去完成“突击任务”，只能造成这样的结果：有时候在表面上“完成”了可以用数字计算出来的任务；可是，不但没有通过自己的工作提高群众的觉悟，反而在群众中造成了不好的政治影响。有时候就直接碰了钉子，要“完成”数字任务也很困难。像粮食统购统销，如果不结合互助合作，就会失去可以依靠的力量，如果不结合生产，就会使群众认不清统购统销和生产的关系，不能消除他们的疑虑。特别是正当群众的思想活动集中在同他们的个人利益有密切关系的评议入社的生产资料，问题还没有解决，思想斗争正在紧张的时候，把他们的活动一下子打断，孤立地进行“突击”工作，就会更增加他们的疑虑。在这种情况下，“突击任务”是很难顺利完成的。
    “结合”是不是像某些同志想像的那样“可怕”呢？看看南宫县东里家庄乡和柏乡县营儿村的情形就可以知道了。东里家庄乡把工作做了全盘安排，由乡总支书记统一领导，全乡干部分工负责，把统购统销的宣传教育工作和发展、巩固新社的工作做为不可分离的一件事来做，同时通过合作网带动生产工作和统购工作。由于大部分群众对建社、统购的思想顾虑解除了，社会主义觉悟提高了，原有的合作社又起了带头作用，结果，十个新建社和三个扩建社的生产资料评议工作顺利地进行完毕，全乡的秋耕工作也完成了，购粮任务还可能超额完成。
    营儿村也由党的支部把各种工作做了统一的安排，以互助合作组织为中心，组织群众讨论统购统销政策和生产计划，全村四分之三的农户都入了社，互助合作的热情、生产的热情和卖粮的热情同时高涨了起来。通过订生产计划，很快就把全村的粮食生产情况澄清了，原来分配的购粮任务是三万四千多斤，现在计算起来可以有余粮五万三千多斤。耕地、积肥工作进行得很好。新社员牲口、农具的评议工作也顺利地完成了。社的生产队的组织、耕作区的划分、各队牲口农具的搭配也进行得很顺利。
    由此可见，统筹兼顾，全盘安排，可以把许多工作“结合”起来，取得互相监督、互相推动的效果。“突击”一点，放弃其他，是一种懒人作法，必须加以克服和反对。
