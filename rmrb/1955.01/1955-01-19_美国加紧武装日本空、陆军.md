Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: U.S. Air Force authorities recently announced that the United States will hand over eighty-five aircraft to Japan this month to equip the Japanese Air Force. At the same time, according to the Associated Press, the U.S. Air Force will also begin training Japanese Air Force pilots to fly jet aircraft starting in January.

In order to enable Japan to accelerate the expansion of its army, the United States is steadily handing over military equipment such as tanks and artillery to Japan. Kyodo News said: "As of December 20 last year, 85 percent of the target amount had been reached." In addition, according to Kyodo News, the U.S. military has given the Japanese army nearly 60,000 tons of ammunition. In order to receive the approximately 100,000 tons of ammunition that the U.S. military plans to give Japan in total, the Japanese "Defense Agency" is preparing to quickly build ten ammunition depots across the country.
