The American aggressor group and its followers are spreading the word that the so-called "mutual defense treaty" signed between the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is "purely defensive in nature." This lie has now been completely exposed by a dispatch from Taipei published in the Japanese "Sangyo Keizai Shimbun."

The Japanese "Sangyo Keizai Shimbun" published a Taipei dispatch on the 9th, quoting so-called "authoritative sources" as revealing that on December 10 last year, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's "Foreign Minister" Yeh Kung-chao exchanged a secret document in Washington. In the secret document, Dulles guaranteed to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique that the United States would not prevent Chiang Kai-shek from launching a "counter-offensive" against the Chinese people; once the coastal islands occupied by Chiang Kai-shek were attacked by the Chinese people, the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and the Seventh Fleet might participate in defending these islands; the scope of the U.S.-Chiang treaty would be expanded to apply to a part of the Chinese mainland that Chiang Kai-shek might seize; and U.S. troops would occupy land on the mainland from the standpoint of defending Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "territory."

It is interesting to compare these secret guarantees from Dulles, as revealed by the Japanese "Sangyo Keizai Shimbun," with the notes that Dulles exchanged with Yeh Kung-chao on December 10 last year. These notes were revealed by Eisenhower in a document submitted to the U.S. Senate on January 6. The notes stated that the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique had reached the following understanding: Chiang Kai-shek not only "effectively controls" the "territory" mentioned in Article 6 of the U.S.-Chiang treaty, but also "effectively controls other territories." Moreover, Chiang Kai-shek "possesses the inherent right of self-defense for all territories now and hereafter under his control." The secret guarantees revealed by the Japanese "Sangyo Keizai Shimbun" are the concretization of this understanding.

Obviously, the public understanding and secret guarantees between the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique thoroughly prove that the U.S.-Chiang treaty is an aggressive war treaty. These understandings and guarantees clearly depict for the world the full picture of the American conspiracy: the American aggressors attempt to use the U.S.-Chiang treaty to restore Chiang Kai-shek on the Chinese mainland, thereby enabling the United States to occupy all of China and prepare for new wars.

The Chinese people have long pointed out this conspiracy of the United States to the world, but the American aggressor group and its followers deliberately deceive the world by saying that the U.S.-Chiang treaty is "purely defensive in nature."

The followers of the American aggressor group also deliberately create the fallacy of "two Chinas," insisting that this can ease international tensions. Now, the ironclad facts of the so-called understanding and secret documents between the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek prove that the so-called "two Chinas" is actually supporting Chiang Kai-shek's restoration on the Chinese mainland, supporting the American occupation of all of China, and preparing for new wars.

The public understanding and secret guarantees between the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique prove that the Chinese people must complete the sacred task of liberating Taiwan in order to defend their motherland and to defend peace in Asia and the world. This is the demand of the world's conscience. No intimidation or deception can ever change the iron will of the Chinese people, nor can it change the conscience of the world. Those who are trying to defend the U.S.-Chiang treaty, shut up!

    美蒋条约的辩护者们闭嘴吧！
    新华社评论员  江南
    美国侵略集团和它的追随者们到处宣传说，美国和蒋介石卖国集团之间签订的所谓“共同防御条约”是“纯粹防御性质”的。这个鬼话现在被日本“产业经济新闻”的一条从台北发出的消息彻底揭穿了。
    日本“产业经济新闻”在九日刊载的台北消息引用所谓“权威人士”所透露的话说，去年十二月十日，美国国务卿杜勒斯和蒋介石卖国集团的“外交部长”叶公超在华盛顿交换了一项秘密文件。杜勒斯在秘密文件中向蒋介石卖国集团保证：美国将不阻止蒋贼向中国人民发动的“反攻”；一旦蒋贼侵占着的沿海岛屿受到中国人民的攻击，美国的海空军和第七舰队可能参加保卫这些岛屿；美蒋条约的范围将予以扩大，使它适用于蒋贼可能夺取的一部分中国大陆；美国部队将从保卫蒋贼的所谓“领土”的立场来占领大陆上的土地。
    拿日本“产业经济新闻”所透露的杜勒斯的这些秘密保证，和杜勒斯去年十二月十日和叶公超交换的照会比较一下，是很有意思的。这个照会是艾森豪威尔在一月六日送交美国参议院的文件中透露的。照会中说，美国和蒋介石卖国集团之间达成了如下的谅解，即蒋贼不但“有效地控制”美蒋条约第六条中所说的“领土”，“还有效地控制其他领土”。而且蒋贼“对于现在以及今后在它的控制下的全部领土拥有天赋的自卫权利”。日本“产业经济新闻”所透露的秘密保证，就是这项谅解的具体化。
    很明显，美国和蒋介石卖国集团之间的公开的谅解和秘密的保证，彻底地证明了美蒋条约是一个侵略性的战争条约。这些谅解和保证向全世界清楚地画出了美国阴谋的全幅图景：美国侵略者企图利用美蒋条约来使蒋介石在中国大陆复辟，从而使美国侵占全中国，准备新的战争。
    中国人民早就向全世界指出了美国的这个阴谋，但是美国侵略集团和它的追随者们却故意欺骗全世界说，美蒋条约是“纯粹防御性质”的。
    美国侵略集团的追随者们还故意制造什么“两个中国”的论调，硬说这样就可以和缓国际紧张局势。现在，美蒋之间的所谓谅解和秘密文件的铁的事实证明：所谓“两个中国”的说法实际上是支持蒋介石在中国大陆上复辟，支持美国侵占全中国、准备新的战争。
    美国和蒋介石卖国集团之间的公开的谅解和秘密的保证，证明了中国人民为了保卫自己的祖国，为了保卫亚洲和世界的和平，必须完成解放台湾的神圣任务。这是世界的良心的要求。任何恫吓和欺骗都绝不可能改变中国人民铁的意志，不可能改变世界的良心。那些竭力替美蒋条约辩护的人们，你们闭嘴吧！
