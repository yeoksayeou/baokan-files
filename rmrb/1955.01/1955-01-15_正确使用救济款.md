    Correct Use of Relief Funds
    Lin Zhun

    In order to help disaster victims solve their difficulties in life and production, the state has already allocated large amounts of relief funds and various loans. How to use these funds well and maximize their effectiveness in supporting disaster victims to overcome famine through production is a problem that needs to be taken seriously by leading organs at all levels in disaster areas.

    Many disaster areas, when displaced disaster victims return home, quickly distribute relief funds and loans to help them repair houses in a timely manner, mend production tools, rebuild their destroyed homes, and actively engage in agricultural and sideline production. However, the use of relief funds in some disaster areas has serious shortcomings. In some disaster areas, relief funds and loans are stockpiled by county and district authorities; some do not use relief funds to solve the current difficulties of disaster victims, but divert them to matters unrelated to disaster relief; and in some areas, relief funds are embezzled by cadres. According to a survey of four districts and thirteen townships in Wangcheng County, Hunan Province, cadres embezzled 4.1 million yuan in relief funds and misappropriated more than 100 million yuan. In terms of distribution methods, some cadres are not good at promoting democracy and do not follow the mass line, so that those who should be given relief are not given relief, while those who should not be given relief are given relief, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. Some areas have adopted crude assessment and indiscriminate distribution methods, which have fostered a mentality of dependence among disaster victims. These shortcomings, on the one hand, prevent the state's large amount of funds from playing its due role, and on the other hand, prevent the timely resolution of disaster victims' difficulties, which should arouse widespread attention in various disaster areas.

    At a time when the state's construction tasks are very large and the need for funds is increasing day by day, the People's Government has allocated tens of billions of yuan in relief funds and loans to support the people in disaster areas; the people have reason to demand that all localities attach great importance to and earnestly do a good job in the distribution of relief funds, and treat the distribution of relief funds as a serious political task.

    How can the distribution of relief funds be done well? Many areas already have good experience. First, it should be used in areas of urgent need to solve the most pressing difficulties of disaster victims. Secondly, it should be distributed in a timely manner, like "sending charcoal in the snow." The practice of hoarding funds and not distributing them while allowing disaster victims to go hungry and freeze must be changed immediately. Thirdly, it is necessary to focus on the use, concentrate the distribution, and use it in coordination with various funds invested by the state in disaster areas; and according to the actual situation, rationally control the scope of relief, so that relief funds can be used for disaster-stricken households with the greatest difficulties and effectively solve problems.

    In order to make the distribution of relief funds timely and reasonable, the leadership at all levels in the disaster areas must pay full attention and take personal control. Emergency relief requires speed and rationality, and a combination of leadership control and democratic appraisal should be adopted. County and district leading organs should send sufficient cadres to the countryside with the funds to better explain policies to grassroots cadres and the masses and help with distribution. In addition, attention should also be paid to post-distribution inspection and timely correction of deviations in the assessment and distribution. Serious action must be taken against any embezzlement, misappropriation, or waste found.

    正确使用救济款
    林准
    为了帮助灾民解决生活、生产上的困难，国家早已拨下大批救济款和各种贷款。如何把这些款使用好，发挥支持灾民生产渡荒的最大效用，是当前灾区各级领导机关需要重视的问题。
    许多灾区，当外移灾民回乡时，迅速发放救济款和贷款，帮助灾民及时修复房屋，修补生产工具，重建被毁的家园，积极投入农、副业生产。但是，有些灾区对救济款的运用是有严重缺点的。有的灾区的救济款和贷款被县、区机关积压起来；有的不把救济款用于解决灾民当前的困难，而挪用在同救灾无关的事情上；还有些地区的救济款被干部贪污了。据湖南省望城县四个区、十三个乡调查，干部贪污救济款四百一十万元，挪用救济款一亿多万元。在发放方法上，有些干部不善于发扬民主，不会走群众路线，以致应救济的没有救济，不应救济的却救济了，引起群众的不满。有些地区采取粗评滥发的方法，助长了灾民的依赖思想。这些缺点，一方面使国家的大批款项不能发挥应有的作用，另方面使灾民困难得不到及时解决，应引起各有灾地区的普遍注意。
    人民政府在国家建设任务十分巨大，需要资金日益增多的时候，拨出成万亿元的救济款和贷款支持灾区人民；人民有理由要求各地十分重视和切实做好救济款的发放工作，把发放救济款当作一项严肃的政治任务来进行。
    怎样才能把救济款发放工作做好？许多地区已有好的经验。首先要把它用在紧急需要的方面，解决灾民最迫切的困难。其次要发得及时，“雪中送炭”，那种一面压款不发、一面任令灾民挨饿受冻的做法，必须马上转变。第三要重点使用，集中发放，并和国家投入灾区的各种款项互相配合使用；并根据实际情况，合理掌握救济面，使救济款能够用于困难最大的灾户，有效地解决问题。
    要使救济款发放工作做得及时、合理，灾区的各级领导必须充分重视，亲自掌握。紧急救济要求迅速、合理，应采取领导掌握与民主评议相结合的办法，由县、区领导机关派出足够的干部随款下乡，以便更好地对基层干部和群众交代政策、帮助发放。此外，还要注意发放后的检查和及时纠正评发中的偏差，对发现的贪污、挪用、浪费的现象，要进行严肃的处理。
