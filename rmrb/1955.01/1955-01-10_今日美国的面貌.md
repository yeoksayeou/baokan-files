	Eisenhower Increasingly Unpopular in the United States

	The magazine "U.S. News & World Report" reported that U.S. President Eisenhower is becoming increasingly unpopular in the United States.

	The magazine, in an article published on December 24, 1954, cited a Gallup poll showing that in the nine months after Eisenhower took office, the number of Americans surveyed who supported Eisenhower decreased by 12 percent compared to when Eisenhower first took office in early 1953. By the end of last year, the number of people expressing support for Eisenhower had decreased even further, 23 percent less than in early 1953. In the presidential election the year before, Eisenhower had won the vast majority of votes by using the slogan of ending the Korean War, which the American people deeply loathed.

	The article could not hide the fact that the American people were dissatisfied with Eisenhower's policies of safeguarding the interests of monopoly capital. Among the reasons the article cited for the above situation were: "favoring big businesses" and "not helping farmers," etc. The article avoided mentioning the most important reason, which is that the Eisenhower administration actively promoted policies to prepare for a new war. As American newspapers admitted, the people's anxiety about being drawn into a new war was the main reason for the failure of Eisenhower's Republican Party in the congressional elections last November.

	U.S. Government Further Fascistized

	Important officials of the U.S. Department of Justice stated that in 1955 the U.S. government will further intensify the persecution of the American Communist Party and other progressive groups, further strengthening the fascistization of the country.

	Assistant Attorney General Tompkins, head of the Justice Department's Internal Security Division, said in a report submitted to Attorney General Brownell on the 1st that the series of persecutions against the American Communist Party (and actually other progressive groups) in 1954 was "only the beginning." He promised to "tirelessly serve" in persecuting the Communist Party and to "work at a faster pace." He stated that he would use all "legal weapons," including the fascist so-called "Communist Control Act" passed by the 83rd Congress, to do so.

	The Internal Security Division of the U.S. Department of Justice was established last year with the aim of unifying and strengthening the anti-communist activities of various agencies.

	Domestic Crime Cases in the United States Increased Significantly Last Year

	In 1954, domestic social crime cases in the United States continued to increase, reaching a new higher level.

	FBI Director Hoover said in a report submitted to Attorney General Brownell on January 4 that major crime cases across the United States increased by 5 percent in 1954 compared to 1953. According to previous reports in "The New York Times," there were already 2.16 million major crime cases in the United States in 1953, which is an average of nearly 6,000 cases per day. Hoover said in the report that in 1954, major crime cases such as robbery, aggravated assault, rape, and theft set a record for the past decade.

    今日美国的面貌
      艾森豪威尔在美国日益不得人心
    “美国新闻与世界报道”杂志报道说，美国总统艾森豪威尔在美国正日益不得人心。
    这个杂志在一九五四年十二月二十四日刊出的一篇文章中引用了盖洛普民意测验所的调查：在艾森豪威尔执政九个月以后，在被调查的美国人中表示支持艾森豪威尔的比一九五三年年初艾森豪威尔刚上台时就减少了百分之十二。到了去年年底，表示支持艾森豪威尔的人更加减少，比一九五三年年初少了百分之二十三。在前年总统选举中，艾森豪威尔因为以结束美国人民深恶痛绝的朝鲜战争作为竞选口号，曾经获得了极大多数的选票。
    这篇文章无法掩饰这一事实：美国人民不满艾森豪威尔的维护垄断资本的利益的政策。文章对上述情况举出的原因中有：“偏袒大企业”，“不帮助农民”等。文章避免提到最重要的原因，就是艾森豪威尔政府积极推行准备新战争的政策。如美国报纸所承认的，人民对被卷入新战争的忧虑，曾是艾森豪威尔的共和党在去年十一月国会选举中失败的主要原因。
      美国政府进一步法西斯化
    美国司法部重要官员表示，一九五五年美国政府将更加紧迫害美国共产党和其他进步团体，进一步加强国内的法西斯化。
    司法部助理部长、司法部国内安全司司长汤普金斯在一日提交司法部长布朗纳尔的报告中说，一九五四年对美国共产党（实际上还对其他进步团体）进行的一系列迫害“不过是开始”。他保证要
  “不倦地效力”于迫害共产党，要以“更快的速度进行工作”。他表示，他将使用所有的“法律武器”，包括第八十三届国会通过的法西斯性质的所谓“共产党管制法”来这样做。
    美国司法部国内安全司是去年成立的，目的就是要统一和加强各种机构的反共活动。
      美国国内犯罪案件去年大量增加
    一九五四年美国国内社会犯罪案件继续增加，达到一个新的更高的水平。
    美国联邦调查局局长胡佛在一月四日提交司法部长布朗纳尔的报告中说，一九五四年美国全国发生的重大犯罪案件比一九五三年增加了百分之五。根据“纽约时报”以前的报道，一九五三年美国发生的重大犯罪案件已经有两百一十六万件，也就是每天平均将近有六千件。胡佛在报告中说，在一九五四年，抢劫、严重伤人、强奸、偷盗等重大犯罪案件创造了十年以来的纪录。
