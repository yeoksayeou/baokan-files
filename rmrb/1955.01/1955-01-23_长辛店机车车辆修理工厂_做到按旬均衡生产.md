Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory achieved balanced production by decade in 1954. The average monthly output of locomotives throughout the year was: 28.4 percent in the first ten days of the month, 34.3 percent in the middle ten days, and 37.3 percent in the last ten days. The previous phenomenon of being slack at the beginning of the month with little or no output, and then working overtime at the end of the month to catch up with tasks, has been basically eliminated.

In the first and second ten-day periods of 1955 (January 1st to 20th), locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars continued to be produced in a balanced manner.

This achievement is the result of the factory leadership mobilizing all employees to conscientiously implement the suggestions of Soviet experts. Comrade Yaroshenko, a Soviet expert from the Ministry of Railways, came to the factory to assist in the work and put forward many important suggestions. The factory leadership focused on the three basic links of "implementing the operation plan," "doing a good job in technical production preparation," and "promoting the technical operation process," and organized the masses to comprehensively implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, resulting in a new situation in production. Last year, this factory comprehensively, evenly, and overfulfilled the state plan. The total output value completed 120.8 percent of the state plan. The production cycle for repairing locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars was significantly shortened. For example, the average number of days for locomotive overhauls was 24.5 days in 1953, while it was 19.7 days in 1954. The number of locomotives and vehicles returned for rework and repair decreased compared to the previous year.

The widespread and in-depth labor competition between workshops and departments is an important guarantee for achieving this success. In 1954, labor models maintained their honors with new achievements. Liu Guanglu, a Beijing Municipal Labor Model and steelmaking furnace chief, led his team to complete half a year's production tasks in the last four months. Steelmaking efficiency increased from eight furnaces per day to ten furnaces per day, and a new record of eleven furnaces was created. The Ni Jiying team, a Beijing Municipal Labor Model team, universally adopted advanced working methods in production and completed the annual state plan three months and fourteen days ahead of schedule.

In 1955, the state put forward higher requirements for the factory. The locomotive repair task will be increased by 30 percent compared to last year. All employees are full of confidence and ready to create even greater new achievements in the new year.

    长辛店机车车辆修理工厂
    做到按旬均衡生产
    长辛店机车车辆修理工厂在一九五四年已经达到了按旬均衡生产。机车全年逐月平均出车的情况是：上旬出车百分之二十八点四，中旬出车百分之三十四点三，下旬出车百分之三十七点三。历年来月初不出车或很少出车，月末加班加点赶任务的前松后紧的现象基本上已经消灭。
    一九五五年第一旬和第二旬（一月一日到二十日）机、客、货车继续均衡出车。
    这个成绩是工厂领导方面发动全体职工认真贯彻苏联专家建议的结果。铁道部苏联专家亚罗申克同志曾至工厂帮助工作，提出了许多重要的建议。工厂领导方面抓住“贯彻作业计划”“搞好技术生产准备”“推行技术作业过程”三个基本环节，组织群众全面贯彻苏联专家的建议，生产中就出现了新的局面。去年这个工厂全面、均衡、超额地完成了国家计划。总产值完成了国家计划的百分之一百二十点八。机、客、货车修理的生产周期显著缩短。例如，机车大修日数一九五三年平均要二十四点五天，而一九五四年平均为十九点七天。返工重修的机车和车辆均比前年减少。
    车间、科室之间广泛深入地开展着的劳动竞赛是获得这一成绩的重要保证。一九五四年，劳动模范们以新的成绩保持着荣誉。北京市劳动模范、炼钢炉长刘广禄领导他的小组在最后四个月内完成了半年的生产任务。化钢效率由日炼八炉提高到日炼十炉，并创造了炼十一炉的新纪录。北京市劳动模范倪吉英小组在生产中普遍采用先进工作方法，提前三个月零十四天完成了全年国家计划。
    一九五五年国家向工厂提出了更高的要求。机车修理任务比去年要提高百分之三十。全厂职工满怀信心地准备在新的一年创造更高的新成就。
