    Several Questions Regarding "Relying on the Poor Peasants"
    Recently, we have received letters from readers reflecting that some district and township cadres are not very clear about the most fundamental policy of "relying on the poor peasants" when implementing the Party's class policy in rural areas. Such as why it is necessary to "rely on the poor peasants," whether "relying on the poor peasants" includes the new middle peasants, and what matters should be paid attention to when implementing the policy of "relying on the poor peasants," etc. Now, we will answer the above questions as follows:

    (I)
    The Party's task in rural areas during the transition period is to gradually change the individual ownership of the means of production by farmers into collective ownership by farmers through the path of cooperation, and to realize the socialist transformation of agriculture. In order to accomplish this great historical task, we must resolutely implement the class policy of "relying on the poor peasants (including all new middle peasants who were originally poor peasants), firmly uniting with the middle peasants, and restricting and gradually eliminating the rich peasant economy," and we should first and foremost resolutely rely on the poor peasants.

    Why must we rely on the poor peasants? Because: Poor peasants, including the new middle peasants who were originally poor peasants, account for about 50 to 70 percent of the rural population. They are the backbone of the Party and the working class in rural areas, the natural and most reliable allies of the working class, and the main force of the Chinese people's revolutionary ranks. In the past, during the period of the New Democratic Revolution, under the leadership of the working class, the poor peasants stood at the forefront against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Now, during the period of socialist transformation, that is, the socialist revolution, the poor peasants, because they suffered particularly heavily from the exploitation of landlords and capitalists in the past and feel the pain of the small peasant economy particularly deeply, have the most urgent demand for implementing the socialist transformation of agriculture and taking the path of cooperation, and are also the most resolute in the struggle to restrict and gradually eliminate the rich peasant economy. Precisely because the poor peasants (including the new middle peasants who were originally poor peasants) account for the majority of the rural population and are a force that actively supports socialism, resolutely relying on the poor peasants is still an unshakable policy of our Party in the struggle for socialist construction and socialist revolution.

    Currently, some rural cadres still have some confused ideas about relying on the poor peasants: some believe that "in the past, to carry out land reform and struggle against landlords, we had to rely on the poor peasants, but now to develop production, we should rely on the middle peasants who are strong and have good horses and large carts"; some believe that "after land reform, all peasants are the same, there are no classes anymore," and therefore advocate "relying on whoever is active in production"; still others believe that the poor peasants are few in number and are isolated, widowed, old, and weak, lacking labor power, and cannot be relied upon.

    These understandings are all wrong. After the land reform, due to the different situations of the peasants' economic rise, their enthusiasm for production is also different. Among them, there is enthusiasm for developing the cooperative economy, and there is also enthusiasm for developing the individual economy. The middle peasant is both a laborer and a private owner, and he can accept socialist transformation, but is also most easily influenced by the rich peasant. If we only pay attention to developing production without paying attention to developing what kind of production, only rely on activists in production regardless of what kind of activists they are, the result will inevitably be contrary to the Party's class policy in rural areas.

    After the land reform, most of the poor peasants have risen to become new middle peasants, and only 20 to 30 percent of the poor peasants have not yet risen. The main reason why this part of the poor peasants has not risen is because of large populations, weak family foundations, lack of labor, or other unexpected disasters, and therefore they have many difficulties in production and life. For such people, we should actively help them, solve their difficulties in life and production, cultivate and improve their enthusiasm, and make them "leaders" in taking the path of cooperation. Because the purpose of our socialist transformation is to eliminate exploitation and poverty and enable everyone to embark on the road to common prosperity.

    (II)
    Why must relying on the poor peasants include all the new middle peasants who were originally poor peasants? Because the new middle peasants have risen under the leadership of the Party and the help of the People's Government, on the basis of land reform, and through the path of mutual assistance and cooperation. Politically, like the existing poor peasants, they all support the Party and the government, support socialism, and support the cooperative movement. In the past, in all the Party's work in rural areas, they were the backbone and activists, and they will continue to be so in the future. Economically, although the new middle peasants have more means of production and means of subsistence than the existing poor peasants, they still have some difficulties and still urgently demand to take the path of cooperation. Therefore, "relying on the poor peasants" must include all the new middle peasants who were originally poor peasants.

    Some people say, "Existence determines consciousness." Because the economic status of the new middle peasants has changed, the concept of private ownership among some of them has also increased, and they are also easily influenced by capitalism. Then, in the specific implementation of the Party's policies, should we distinguish between the existing poor peasants and the new middle peasants who were originally poor peasants? The new middle peasants are economically better off than the poor peasants, and their economic interests are consistent with those of the old middle peasants. Therefore, when mutual aid teams or cooperatives deal with the specific interests of the new middle peasants, this must be noted. However, the road of economic rise of the new middle peasants is completely different from that of the old middle peasants. This "existence" determines that they will all actively support socialism. As long as the Party organization strengthens their political and ideological education and improves their socialist consciousness, they will resolutely follow the Party and resolutely support socialism. However, do not think that the new middle peasants can be relied upon and ignore the reliance on the existing poor peasants. On the contrary, in the process of developing mutual assistance and cooperation, we must better rely on the current poor peasants; although some of them are isolated, widowed, old, and weak, lacking labor power, their economic conditions determine that they need mutual assistance and cooperation the most, and consistently and thoroughly support the socialist system; it is extremely wrong to exclude the poor peasants.

    (III)
    How should we implement the policy of "relying on the poor peasants" (including all the new middle peasants who were originally poor peasants; the following mentions of poor peasants all mean this)? First of all, we should establish the leading advantage of the poor peasants ideologically, politically, and organizationally. The Party organization should seriously educate all cadres on relying on the poor peasants, explaining that the implementation of the socialist transformation of agriculture is a serious class struggle, and the Party must find the class forces that support socialism in order to more effectively unite with the middle peasants, restrict and gradually eliminate the rich peasant economy, and complete the socialist transformation. At the same time, we should also strengthen political and ideological education for the poor peasants, and systematically train and select poor peasant backbones, patiently and meticulously help them, solve their practical difficulties, establish their confidence in their work, and improve their working ability. The Party and Youth League organizations in rural areas should pay attention to training and absorbing activists who meet the requirements from among the poor peasants to join the Party and the League. On this basis, appropriately adjust the leading components of the Party, the League, grassroots government, and mutual assistance and cooperation organizations in rural areas, put the poor peasants in leading positions, and establish the leading advantage of the poor peasants in various organizations. Currently, some areas believe that the poor peasants "have no culture, no ability, and no time," and therefore do not pay attention to training and selecting poor peasant backbones, and do not allow the poor peasants to be leading cadres. This practice is wrong and must be corrected.

    Secondly, we must also adhere to the long-term policy of supporting the poor peasants economically, helping the poor peasants to overcome the difficulties in production and life, so as to prevent them from becoming poor and bankrupt due to natural disasters and man-made misfortunes. The way to support them is mainly to educate the poor peasants to actively participate in agricultural mutual assistance and cooperation, supply and marketing cooperation, credit cooperation, and other organizations, so that the poor peasants and other laboring peasants can embark on the road to common prosperity through the support and help of the Party and the government to these organizations.

    Finally, we should pay attention to relying on the Party's grassroots organizations and strengthening the Party's leading role when implementing the policy of "relying on the poor peasants," and prevent the tendency to deviate from the Party's leadership. Only by doing these tasks well can we truly rely on the poor peasants, and can we firmly unite with the middle peasants, restrict and even gradually eliminate the rich peasant economy, and complete the socialist transformation of agriculture.

### 关于“依靠贫农”的几个问题

    关于“依靠贫农”的几个问题
    近来我们接到一些读者来信，反映有些区、乡干部在执行党在农村的阶级政策的时候，对“依靠贫农”这一最根本的政策的认识还不很明确。如为什么要“依靠贫农”，“依靠贫农”是否包括新中农在内，在执行“依靠贫农”的政策时应注意哪些事情等问题。现在，就上述问题答复如下：
    （一）
    过渡时期党在农村的任务，就是要通过合作化的道路，把生产资料的农民个体所有制逐步改变为农民集体所有制，实现对农业的社会主义改造。为了完成这个伟大的历史任务，必须坚决贯彻“依靠贫农（包括全部原来是贫农的新中农），巩固地团结中农，限制和逐步消灭富农经济”的阶级政策，而且首先应该坚决依靠贫农。
    为什么必须依靠贫农？因为：贫农，包括原来是贫农的新中农，大约占农村人口的百分之五十到七十。它们是党和工人阶级在农村中的支柱，是工人阶级天然的和最可靠的同盟军，是中国人民革命队伍的主力军。过去，在新民主主义革命时期，贫农在工人阶级的领导下，曾经站在反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的最前线。现在，在社会主义改造即社会主义革命时期，贫农由于过去受地主、资本家的剥削特别惨重，对小农经济的痛苦感受得特别深刻，因而对实行农业社会主义改造走合作化道路的要求最迫切，对限制和逐步消灭富农经济的斗争也最坚决。正因为贫农（包括原来是贫农的新中农）占农村人口的大多数，又是积极支持社会主义的力量，所以坚决依靠贫农仍然是我党在社会主义建设和社会主义革命斗争中不可动摇的政策。
    目前有些农村干部对于依靠贫农还有一些糊涂观念：有人认为“过去搞土地改革斗争地主，一定要依靠贫农，现在发展生产，应该依靠人强马壮、地好车大的中农”；有人认为“土地改革以后农民都一样了，没有什么阶级了”，因而主张“谁生产积极就依靠谁”；还有人认为贫农人数少，又是孤寡老弱，缺乏劳动力，不能作为依靠对象。
    这些认识都是错误的。在土地改革以后，由于农民经济上升的状况不同，他们的生产积极性也不一样。他们中，有发展合作经济的积极性，也有发展个体经济的积极性。中农是劳动者又是私有者，它能够接受社会主义改造，也最易接受富农的影响。如果只注意发展生产而不注意发展什么样的生产，只依靠生产中的积极分子而不管他是什么样的积极分子，结果必然会同党在农村中的阶级政策相违背。
    土地改革以后，大部分贫农都上升为新中农了，只有百分之二十到三十的贫农还没有上升。这一部分贫农所以没有上升，主要是由于人口多、家底薄、劳力缺或遭受了其他意外灾害，因而在生产上、生活上有很多困难。对于这样的人，我们应该积极帮助他们，解决生活和生产上的困难，培养和提高他们的积极性，使他们成为走合作化道路的“带头人”。因为我们实行社会主义改造的目的，就是为了消灭剥削和贫困，使大家走上共同富裕的道路。
    （二）
    为什么依靠贫农，必须包括全部原来是贫农的新中农呢？因为新中农是在党的领导和人民政府的帮助下，在土地改革的基础上，通过互助合作的道路上升起来的。在政治上他们同现有贫农一样，都拥护党和政府，拥护社会主义，拥护合作化运动。过去党在农村的一切工作中，他们曾是骨干和积极分子，今后也仍然会是这样。在经济上，新中农虽然比现有贫农有着较多的生产资料和生活资料，但仍然存在着若干困难，仍然迫切要求走合作化的道路。因此，“依靠贫农”必须包括全部原来是贫农的新中农在内。
    有人说，“存在决定意识”，由于新中农的经济地位有了变化，他们之中有些人的私有观念也就有所增长，而且也容易受到资本主义的影响，那么在具体执行党的政策时，对于现有的贫农和原为贫农的新中农是不是要加以区别呢？新中农在经济上比贫农要好一些，在经济利害的关系上同老中农是一致的，因此，在互助组或合作社处理新中农具体利益的问题时，必须注意到这一点。但是，新中农经济上升的道路是同老中农完全不同的，这种“存在”就决定了他们都会积极拥护社会主义。只要党组织加强对他们的政治思想教育，提高他们的社会主义觉悟，他们就会坚决跟着党走，坚决拥护社会主义。但是，千万不要以为新中农是可以依靠的，就忽视了对现有贫农的依靠。相反，在发展互助合作的过程中，还必须更好地依靠现在的贫农；尽管他们中间有些人是缺乏劳动力的孤寡老弱，但是他们的经济状况决定了他们最需要互助合作，并且一贯到底地拥护社会主义制度；如果排斥贫农是极端错误的。
    （三）
    究竟应该怎样贯彻“依靠贫农”（包括全部原来是贫农的新中农，以下讲到贫农的地方都是这个意思）的政策呢？首先应在思想上、政治上、组织上树立贫农的领导优势。党的组织应该认真地对全体干部进行依靠贫农的教育，说明实行农业社会主义改造是一场严重的阶级斗争，党必须找到支持社会主义的阶级力量，才能更有效地团结中农，限制和逐步消灭富农经济，完成社会主义改造。同时，对贫农也应加强政治思想教育，并有计划地培养、选拔贫农骨干，耐心地、细致地帮助他们，解决他们的实际困难，树立他们的工作信心，提高他们的工作能力。农村中的党和青年团组织，应该注意培养、吸收贫农中合乎条件的积极分子入党入团。在这个基础上，适当地调整农村中的党、团、基层政权、互助合作组织的领导成份，把贫农放到领导岗位上去，树立贫农在各种组织中的领导优势。目前有的地区认为贫农“没文化、没能力、没时间”，因而不注意培养、选拔贫农骨干，不让贫农当领导干部，这种作法是错误的，必须纠正。
    其次，在经济上还必须坚持长期扶植贫农的方针，帮助贫农克服生产、生活上的困难，以免他们因天灾人祸而贫穷破产。扶植的办法，主要是教育贫农积极参加农业互助合作、供销合作、信用合作等组织，通过党和政府对这些组织的扶植和帮助，使贫农和其他劳动农民走上共同富裕的道路。
    最后，应该注意在贯彻“依靠贫农”的政策时，必须依靠党的基层组织，加强党的领导作用，防止离开党的领导的倾向。做好了这些工作，才是真正依靠了贫农，也才能巩固地团结中农，限制以至逐步消灭富农经济，完成农业的社会主义改造。
