The first small (30 horsepower) mobile air compressor in China was successfully trial-produced by the state-owned Nanchang Diesel Engine Factory at the end of last year. This air compressor has the advantages of being lightweight, flexible, and easy to move, and can be used for drilling, mining, and road construction. During the trial production process, thanks to the unity and mutual assistance of engineering and technical personnel and veteran technicians, the wind pressure, air volume, horsepower, and fuel consumption all met the standard machine performance and fully complied with specifications. The factory will manufacture this machine in large quantities this year.

    小型移动式空气压缩机试制成功
    我国第一台小型（三十马力）移动式空气压缩机，已在去年底由国营南昌柴油机厂试制成功。这种空气压缩机具有轻便、灵巧、移动方便等优点，可供钻探、采矿和开山、筑路时使用。在试制过程中，由于工程技术人员和老技工团结互助，保证风压、风量、马力、耗油量等达到了标准机器性能，完全合乎规格。今年该厂将大批制造这种机器。
