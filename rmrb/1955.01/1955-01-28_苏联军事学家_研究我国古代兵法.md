Xinhua News Agency, Leningrad, January 27th: Soviet military science candidate Dr. G. Karayev Major General has recently completed his research on ancient Chinese military strategy.

During his research, Karayev studied a large number of Russian, French, English, and German books on Chinese history published in the last three centuries, and for the first time translated the Chinese military theory works "Wu Zi" and "Sima Fa" from the pre-Christian era into Russian.

Karayev's research of these materials proves that China had military strategy many centuries before the development of military strategy by the ancient Greeks and Romans. As early as 2500 years BC, the Chinese army already had a strict organization and adopted skirmishing formations to fight, which made fighting on the battlefield very mobile. It was during this same period that the first news came out that the Chinese had used the compass for military purposes. The Chinese were also the first to use engineering operations in field battles. In the military strategy of Sun Tzu, an ancient Chinese military theorist, many principles still retain their value today.

    研究我国古代兵法
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社列宁格勒讯：苏联军事学候补博士格·卡拉耶夫少将最近完成了有关中国古代兵法的研究工作。
    卡拉耶夫在研究的过程中，研究了最近三世纪来出版的大量的关于中国历史的俄文、法文、英文和德文书籍，并且第一次用俄文翻译了纪元前中国军事理论著作吴子和司马法。
    卡拉耶夫研究这些材料的结果证明，早在古希腊人和罗马人的兵法发展以前的许多世纪，中国就已经有了兵法。在纪元前两千五百多年，中国的军队已经有了严紧的编制，并且采用散兵队形来作战，这种队形使得在战场上作战很机动。就在这同一时期，第一次传出了中国人把指南针用于军事方面的消息。在野战中第一次使用工兵作业的也是中国人。在古代中国的军事理论家孙子的兵法中，有许多原理直到现在还保有它的价值。
