The day of the official opening of the Kangzang and Qingzang Highways was a joyous day longed for by the Tibetan people.

On that day—December 25, 1954—every household in Lhasa flew the Five-Star Red Flag and red flags, and people flocked to the eastern and western suburbs of Lhasa. Representatives from all walks of life in Lhasa held a celebration meeting in front of the Potala Palace. When the two motorcades of the Kangzang and Qingzang Highways and the joyful crowds converged in front of the magnificent Potala Palace, the Tibetan people cheered with gratitude and love.

At the meeting, there were guests from the capital of the motherland and representatives from various places in Tibet and the Qamdo area. They presented dozens of silk banners to the road-building heroes.

The thousands of households in Lhasa spent this day in a joyous atmosphere, leaving an unforgettable and profound impression on the Tibetan people. (Attached pictures)

After the meeting in front of the Potala Palace, the two motorcades of the Kangzang and Qingzang Highways drove into the venue side by side.

More than seventy silk banners, representing the entrustment and goodwill of the people of all ethnic groups across the country, are prepared to be presented to the heroes who participated in the road construction.
