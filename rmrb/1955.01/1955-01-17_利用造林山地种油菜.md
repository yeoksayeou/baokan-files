Farmers in the mountainous areas of Jian'ou County, Fujian Province, have recently planted more than 2,300 mu of rapeseed on mountain land cleared for afforestation. This type of rapeseed is directly sown, and the labor required per mu is two workdays less than planting rapeseed on flat land. Furthermore, because the mountain land that has been cleared and burned is more fertile, one mu of mountain rapeseed can save four dan of human manure fertilizer compared to flat land. Planting this type of rapeseed loosens the soil on the mountain land, which will facilitate planting fir trees and miscellaneous grains in the spring.

Currently, the rapeseed on the mountain is growing very well, and the estimated yield is not expected to be much lower than that on flat land. Gan Jiuxian, a farmer from Fangdao Township, Third District, planted one mu of mountain rapeseed, which is growing even more luxuriantly than rapeseed on flat land.

    利用造林山地种油菜
    福建省建瓯县山区农民最近利用劈山造林的山地种了二千三百多亩油菜。这种油菜是直播的，每亩地花工要比在平原种油菜省两个工，又因劈草炼山的山地较肥，一亩山油菜比平原还可以节省四担人粪肥。种了这种油菜的山地土质松了，将便于春天插杉和种杂粮。
    目前，山上的油菜长得都很好，估计收获量不比平原差多少。三区房道乡农民甘九仙种的一亩山油菜，比平原油菜长得还茂盛。
