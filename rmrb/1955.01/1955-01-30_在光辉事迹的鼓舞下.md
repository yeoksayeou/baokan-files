To the editorial staff, please forward to our most beloved honorary soldiers, wounded and sick soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers, uncles and aunts:

    When you are celebrating the Spring Festival with the people of the whole country, you will be even happier to receive this letter from us!

    Uncles and aunts: you are the most lovable people in our eyes. We deeply remember Uncle You Hui of the Volunteer Army, who lost his hands on the Korean battlefield, but still insisted on revolutionary work and wrote many moving articles. We firmly remember his words: "Studying hard is glory, overcoming difficulties is victory." We remember many Liberation Army uncles and aunts who performed meritorious deeds and were injured in the Liberation War and became disabled. They are still carrying forward the glorious revolutionary tradition on the production front, working hard in production and actively working. Your heroic achievements are countless and endless. Your glorious deeds are not only the strength to defend the motherland and build the motherland, but also the locomotive that drives us children to keep moving forward.

    Thinking back to last spring, our grades in various subjects were not good. Under the education of teachers and counselors and the help of classmates, everyone proposed to learn from uncles and aunts and dedicate excellent academic achievements to the motherland. Now the grades in all subjects are very different from before. For example, in the most recent arithmetic test, 39 out of 44 students in the class received an "A", only 5 were left with a "B", and "C" grades have been completely eliminated.

    During the summer vacation, under the leadership of the higher authorities, the people of the city bravely carried out flood prevention work. Tan Yuansheng, the class chairman of our class, was only eighteen years old, and he also voluntarily signed up to join the flood prevention commando team of Desheng Street. We once donated 175 books and stationery to support the classmates in the disaster area and wrote 242 letters of condolences to the soldiers. Recently, teachers and counselors called on us to be vigilant against corruption and degeneration, and the radio station also called on us not to read bad "children's books". We have now completely achieved this. During the winter vacation, everyone proposed:
  "Overcome the cold, improve grades, and do well in the term exams; do a good job in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers; support the liberation of Taiwan!"

    There are still many things we should do. We hope that uncles and aunts will often educate us.

    All students of Class 4, Grade 5, Hankou No. 20 Primary School, Wuhan (written by Wang Bin)

### 在光辉事迹的鼓舞下

专栏：

    在光辉事迹的鼓舞下编辑同志请转最敬爱的荣誉军人、伤病员和复员转业军人叔叔阿姨们：
    当你们和全国人民一道欢度春节的时刻，接到我们这封信，你们一定会更加高兴吧！
    叔叔和阿姨们：你们是我们心目中最可爱的人。我们深深地记得志愿军尤辉叔叔，他在朝鲜战场上失去了双手，依然坚持革命工作，写出了很多动人的文章。我们牢牢地记住他的话：“努力学习就是光荣，克服困难就是胜利”。我们记得不少解放军叔叔阿姨在解放战争时立过功，受了伤，变成了残废，他们还是在生产战线上发扬着光荣的革命传统，努力生产和积极工作。你们的英雄业绩是数不清说不完的，你们的光辉事迹，不仅是保卫祖国和建设祖国的力量，而且也是带动我们小朋友不断前进的火车头。
    回想去年春天，我们的各科成绩是不好的，在老师和辅导员们的教育和同学们的帮助下，大家都提出要学习叔叔阿姨们，要以优良的学业成绩献给祖国。现在各科成绩都比以前大不相同了。像最近一次的算术成绩全班四十四人中有三十九人得到甲等，只剩五人是乙等，丙等已经完全消灭了。
    在暑假中，上级领导全市人民英勇地进行防汛斗争，我们班上的班主席谈远胜只有十八岁，他也自动报名参加了得胜街防汛突击队。我们曾经捐了一百七十五件书籍文具支援灾区同学，写出慰问战士的信二百四十二封。最近老师、辅导员号召我们要警惕腐化堕落，广播电台也号召我们不要看内容坏的“伢伢书”。我们现在都完全做到了。在寒假中大家提出：
  “战胜寒冷，提高成绩，考好期考；做好拥军优属工作；支援解放台湾！”
    我们应该做的事还很多。希望叔叔阿姨们经常教育我们。
    武汉市汉口第二十小学五年级四班全体同学（王彬代笔）
