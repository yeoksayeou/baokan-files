    The supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives in the newly built districts and industrial and mining areas of Beijing have developed in both organization and business over the past year. Forty-one comprehensive district stores have been newly built, and eighty distribution points have been newly built in construction sites, factories, schools, government offices, and employee dormitories. Twenty-four stores and distribution points have been expanded; in addition, sixteen mobile tricycle sales carts have been set up.
    The comprehensive district stores are relatively large in scale, with generally around 1,000 kinds of goods, and the most have more than 2,500 kinds. These stores are mostly located in traffic hubs and areas where employees gather. They are connected to the specialized stores of state-owned department stores, the distribution points of the cooperative system, and service institutions, and have initially formed a socialist commercial network in the newly built districts and industrial and mining areas.
    In the past, it was inconvenient for employees, students, and others in the newly built districts and industrial and mining areas to purchase goods. Some had to go to distant towns or into the city to buy things, and some employees' families often could not eat fresh meat and vegetables. Now this situation has greatly changed. (Jia Zhouwen)

    首都新建区合作社的发展
    北京市新建区和工矿区的供销合作社和消费合作社，去年一年来在组织方面和业务方面都有了发展。新建的地区综合性门市部有四十一处，在建筑工地、工厂、学校、机关及职工宿舍区新建的分销处有八十处；扩大的门市部和分销处有二十四处；另外还设立了流动三轮售货车十六辆。
    地区综合性门市部规模比较大，商品种类一般在一千种左右，最多的有二千五百多种。这些门市部大都分设在交通要冲和职工聚集的地区。它们同国营百货公司的专业门市部、合作社系统的分销处和服务性机构联系起来，已经初步构成了新建区和工矿区社会主义的商业网。
    过去新建区和工矿区的职工、学生等购买货物不方便，有的要到很远的街镇或进城买东西，有的职工家属常吃不上新鲜肉菜。现在这种情况已经有了很大的改变。　（贾周文）
