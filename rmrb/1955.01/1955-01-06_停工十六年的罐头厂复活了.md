Sixteen-Year-Shutdown Cannery Revived

    Fujian Province has recently established a new joint state-private Xiamen Cannery. On December 18 and 20, 1954, this factory produced its first batch of canned goods.

    The predecessor of this factory was the Xiamen Cannery branch of Tao Hua Da Tong Co., Ltd., established by overseas Chinese at the end of the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty. In 1938, it collapsed under the attacks of imperialism and bureaucratic capital. Since then, the machinery and equipment had been idle like waste for sixteen years. Not long ago, the person in charge of this factory applied to the state to implement joint state-private ownership. The state accepted this request, allocated funds, and purchased a batch of equipment from other places, such as soup filling machines, double-jacketed cooking pots, pressure sterilizers, and juice pressing machines. The machines that had been shut down for sixteen years have finally been revived.

    This factory will first produce canned mandarin orange segments, mandarin orange jam, and oyster. In the future, it will utilize the abundant products of the Southern Fujian Overseas Chinese area, such as lychees, waxberries, chickens, ducks, and lancelets, to process and manufacture canned goods.

    停工十六年的罐头厂复活了
    福建省最近新成立了一个公私合营的厦门罐头食品厂。一九五四年十二月十八日和二十日，这个工厂制出了第一批罐头。
    这个工厂的前身，是华侨开设的淘化大同股份有限公司厦门罐头分厂，创办于满清光绪末年。一九三八年，它在帝国主义和官僚资本的打击下倒闭了。从此，机器设备像废物一样搁了十六年。不久以前，这个工厂的负责人向国家申请实行公私合营。国家接受了这个请求，拨款并从外地买进一批灌汤机、双重煮锅、压力杀菌机、果汁压榨机等设备。停工十六年的机器终于复活了。
    这个工厂将先制造柑片、柑酱和海蛎罐头。将来，它将利用闽南侨乡出产的荔枝、杨梅、鸡、鸭、文昌鱼等丰富的物产，加工制造罐头。
