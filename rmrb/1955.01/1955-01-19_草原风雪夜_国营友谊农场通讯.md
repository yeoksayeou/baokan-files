A Snowy Night on the Prairie
—Communication from the State-Owned Friendship Farm
By Our Reporter Li Wen

Night deepened, and the prairie was plunged into darkness. The northwest wind howled, carrying snow and sand.

At this moment, the two thatched houses at the east end of Taiping Village (a small village of sixty households on the edge of the Sandaogang Prairie in Jixian County, Heilongjiang Province) glowed with a warm yellow light. This was originally where the students of the people's school studied. Tonight (December 21st), the studies at the people's school had ended long ago, but several young farmers were still talking. They were members of the third militia group from this village, supporting the construction of the State-Owned Friendship Farm. The other members of this militia group had gone home to rest, preparing to take over from the second group at midnight. Their task was to conduct deep-well drilling day and night, providing timely data on groundwater and soil structure for the planning and design of the farm headquarters site.

After returning home from the people's school, Wang Dingku, a member of the Communist Youth League, did not go to sleep. He reviewed a few lessons and then enthusiastically began to practice his calligraphy. Feeling that the time to leave was approaching, he put down his study book, put on his large cotton coat, glanced back at his wife, who was already sound asleep on the warm kang, and walked out the door. A gust of wind, carrying snow and sand, hit him in the face, and he couldn't help shivering, exclaiming, "What cold weather!" He carefully closed the door. The wind was blowing hard, making it difficult for him to breathe. He leaned into the wind and hurried towards the people's school.

When Wang Dingku arrived at the people's school, Ma Zhenguo, a technician from the land reclamation survey team who had been transferred from the Shuangyashan Coal Mine to support the farm's construction as a drilling worker, and all the members of the group had gathered. On the table were steaming mantou and turnip soup. Everyone was gobbling down their food, preparing to depart, while discussing the weather tonight.

When such a strong wind blows on the prairie, even during the day, it can become dark and gloomy. Farmers often say in such weather: "Going out a mile for a wedding feast is not as good as staying home and drinking cold water." Today, some militia members said: "Even if there is such a strong wind, even if it is a 'yellow' wind or a 'flood' rain, we still have to go to work and drill wells. The Soviet elder brothers have traveled thousands of miles to help us build the farm, and we must work even harder." Another added: "Even if there is no car to take us to the site, we will still go."

At midnight, the third group of militia members arrived at the site on time, taking over from the second group.

Here, a temporary shed made of mats stood alone on the vast prairie, like a solitary island in a boundless sea. Inside the shed, next to a hand-drilling machine, hung two "unbreakable lamps" (small lanterns), and in the corner of the shed, there was also a coal stove. Drilling technician Ma Zhenguo and militia group leader Xuan Jilin held the drill, while Wang Dingku and several other young men pulled the rope. With each pull and release of the rope, the flat-headed drill slowly penetrated the stratum...

The wind grew stronger and stronger, repeatedly assaulting the small mat shed, as if trying to swallow it in one gulp. The frame of the mat shed creaked in the strong wind. The mats were torn by the wind, and the militia members quickly nailed them back on. Outside the shed, there was a strong wind, and inside the shed, there was a smaller wind. The militia members worked intensely. "We've hit sand!" people shouted excitedly, praising their achievements.

The mud and water brought up by the rope flowed onto the high-hanging pulley, and the pulley froze. Ma Zhenguo leaped up, climbed onto the wooden frame, and followed the rafters to the top. The wind rushed towards him. He held tightly to the wooden frame with one hand, skillfully removed the pulley, and shouted, "Quick, bake the pulley!"

Before long, the "luzi" used to clamp the drill pipe also froze, and people quickly removed it and took it to the coal stove to bake.

The most arduous work was still emptying the water pump. Whenever the casing was inserted thirty or forty centimeters into the stratum, the mud, sand, and soil samples inside the casing had to be taken out with a water pump. In temperatures of more than twenty degrees below zero Celsius, holding the iron rod was as painful as grabbing ice. After one young man emptied the water pump once, another quickly took over to empty it a second time. The person who had held the water pump hurried to the stove to warm his hands, and a little carelessness could peel off a layer of skin.

The mud and water brought from the depths of the stratum to the top of the casing quickly froze into ice, blocking the casing. Only a small opening the size of a duck egg remained in the casing. Should they use fire to bake it? It was dangerous to burn firewood in the strong wind. "I have a solution. I'll go to Sanjianfang (about two hundred meters from the site) to get water, boil it, and scald it open," Dong Zhiguang said, and walked out of the shed. When Dong Zhiguang returned, he had practically turned into a snowman, with a layer of snow and sand covering his leather hat and large coat, and many small icicles hanging from his eyelashes. He approached the stove, and his whole body steamed.

Drilling began again, the militia members rhythmically pulling the rope, the flat-headed drill going deeper and deeper. Suddenly, one end of the rope climbed to the top of the frame, and the screw on the drill rod head slipped off. Without waiting for the technician, old Ma, to give the order, Wang Dingku agilely jumped onto the wooden frame and climbed to the top to take the rope head down...

They were accustomed to the roar of the wind, accustomed to the severe cold of the prairie. They did not notice when the east turned white, did not notice that the newly risen sun was again obscured by the snow fog. It was not until the car brought the day shift militia members to the shed that they realized it was already eight o'clock in the morning.

    草原风雪夜
    ——国营友谊农场通讯
    本报记者　力文
    夜深了，草原上一片漆黑。西北风挟着雪沙吼叫着。
    这时，太平屯（黑龙江省集贤县三道岗草原边缘的一个六十户的小村）东头的两间草房里透出黄澄澄的灯光。这里原是民校学员们学习的地方，今晚（十二月二十一日）民校的学习已结束多时了，还有几个青年农民在谈话。他们是本屯支援建设国营友谊农场第三民工小组的民工。这个民工小组的另外几个人回家休息去了，准备午夜去接替第二组的工作。他们的任务是不分昼夜地进行深井钻探，为农场总部场址的规划设计，及时提供地下水和土层结构方面的资料。
    青年团员王鼎库，从民校回到家里，并没有睡觉，复习了几课书，又乘兴写起字来。他觉着快到出发的时间了，放下学习本，穿起大棉袄，回头望一望热炕上已睡熟的妻子，便走出门来。一股风裹着雪沙，扑面打来，他不禁打了个寒颤，脱口而出地说了一声：“好冷的天啊！”他小心地把门关好。风刮得正紧，吹得他喘不过气来。他迎着风侧着身子急忙忙向着民校奔去。
    王鼎库走到民校的时候，土地整理考察组的技术人员、从双鸭山煤矿调来支援农场建场的钻探工人马振国和全组民工已聚齐了。桌子上，摆着热腾腾的馒头和萝?汤，大家一面狼吞虎咽地吃饭，准备出发，一面议论着今晚的天气。
    草原上刮起这样的大风，就是在白天，也会天昏地暗。农民们常常说在这样天气里：“一里路出门赶个嘴（吃酒席），不如坐家喝凉水。”今天，民工们有人说：“不要说这样大风，就是刮‘黄’风，下‘洪’雨，也得上班打井。苏联老大哥越过千山万水，来帮助我们建农场，我们更得加紧工作。”另一个补充说：“不要说有汽车送我们去现场，就是没有汽车，我们也是要去的。”
    午夜十二时，第三小组民工按时到达了现场，接替了第二小组的工作。
    这里有一个临时用席子搭起的工棚，兀立在辽阔的草原上，像茫茫大海中的一个孤岛。棚子里，一架手钻机的旁边，挂着两盏“气死风”（小提灯），棚子的角落里，还生着一个煤火炉。钻探技工马振国和民工组长宣纪林把钻，王鼎库和另外几个青年小伙子拉绳，绳子一收一放，扁头钻一点点伸入地层……
    风越刮越大，一次又一次地冲击着这个小小的席棚，像要一口吞掉它似的。席棚架子在大风中咯咯直响。席子被风撕开了，民工们急忙把它钉上。棚子外面刮大风，棚子里面刮小风。民工们紧张地工作着，“见砂子了！”人们高兴地喊着，赞许着自己的成绩。
    绳子带起的泥水，流到高高悬挂的滑车上，滑车冻住了。马振国将身一纵，攀上木架，顺着椽木爬到了顶上。风呼呼地向他扑去。他一只手紧抱着木架，熟练地摘下滑车，嚷道：“快把滑车烤一烤。”
    不一会，卡钻杆用的“橹子”也冻住了，人们急忙把它卸下来，拿到煤火炉上去烤。
    最艰苦的工作，还是倒水泵。每逢套管插下地层三四十公分，便要用水泵取出套管里的泥砂和土样。在摄氏零下二十多度的气候里，拿铁棍就像抓冰渣一样的痛。这个小伙子倒完一次水泵，另一个小伙子赶快接过来倒第二次。拿过水泵的人急忙到火炉旁暖一暖手，稍一不慎，便会粘去一层皮。
    水泵从地层深处带到套管上端的泥和水，很快便冻成冰块，堵住套管。套管只剩下鸭蛋大的一个小眼了。用火烤吧，大风中燃柴火有危险。“有办法，我到三间房（离现场约有二百公尺）取水，烧滚水，烫开它。”董志广说罢，走出工棚。董志广回来的时候，简直变成了雪人，皮帽子上，大袄上，浑身上下蒙上了一层雪沙，眼毛上挂着许多小冰块。他走近火炉，全身呼呼地冒热气。
    钻探又开始了，民工们有节奏地拉着绳子，扁头钻一点点深下去。突然，绳头的一端爬上了架子顶，钻杆头的螺丝滑掉了。没有等技工老马的吩咐，王鼎库敏捷地跳上木架，爬到架子顶上，把绳头取下来……。
    他们习惯了狂风的吼叫，习惯了草原的严寒。他们没有发觉何时东方发白，没有发觉刚升起的太阳又被雪雾遮住。直到汽车带着日班民工来到工棚的时候，才知道，已是早晨八点钟了。
