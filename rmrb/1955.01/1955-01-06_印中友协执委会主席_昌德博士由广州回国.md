Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 5th. Dr. Gyan Chand, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the India-China Friendship Association, arrived in Hong Kong from Guangzhou on the 2nd and left Hong Kong for his home country on the 4th. In Hong Kong, Dr. Chandrasekhar made a statement to reporters. After mentioning the just demand of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan, he said: Taiwan is undoubtedly Chinese territory, and American interference is very unreasonable. The idea of neutralization is also completely unfounded. The Chinese people have the right to liberate Taiwan and should liberate Taiwan. No country has any reason to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan.

Dr. Chandrasekhar visited China in 1952. He believes that China is much more consolidated and powerful than it was two years ago. He said: "China's economy is developing rapidly and healthily. The socialist transformation of the national economy is proceeding rapidly along the right path and has gained full cooperation from the people."

    印中友协执委会主席
    昌德博士由广州回国
    【新华社广州五日电】印中友好协会执行委员会主席吉安·昌德博士，二日由广州抵达香港，已在四日离香港回国。昌德博士在香港曾对各报记者发表了谈话。他的谈话在讲到中国人民解放台湾的正义要求以后说：台湾毫无疑问是中国的领土，美国的干涉是非常不讲理的，中立化的说法也完全没有根据的。中国人民有权解放台湾，并且应该解放台湾。任何国家都没有理由阻止中国人民解放台湾。
    昌德博士在一九五二年曾访问过中国。他认为中国已比两年前巩固强大得多了。他说：“中国经济正在非常健康的情况下迅速地向上发展。国民经济的社会主义改造正循着正确的道路迅速进行，并且获得了人民充分的合作”。
