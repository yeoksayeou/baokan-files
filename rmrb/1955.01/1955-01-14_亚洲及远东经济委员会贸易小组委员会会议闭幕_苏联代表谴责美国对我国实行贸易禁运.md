Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch: According to TASS, the meeting of the Trade Subcommittee of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, held in Hong Kong, concluded on the 12th. The representatives attending the meeting exchanged views on the foreign economic policies of various countries and the possibility of developing trade in the region of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East.

Pakistani representative Syed spoke during the discussion and raised difficulties in the sale of Pakistani products. He said that in 1953-1954, Pakistan's total foreign trade decreased by 402.8 million rupees. He said that the reason for the sharp decline in exports was the decline in raw cotton exports due to the shrinking of foreign markets.

Japanese representative Okita said that the necessary and prerequisite condition for the development of international trade is to stop discrimination in foreign trade. He was referring here to the difficulties Japan has suffered. It is known that the cause of these difficulties is mainly that the United States has forced Japan to restrict its trade with countries of the democratic camp, while the United States and Britain have adopted discriminatory tariff policies against Japanese goods. The Japanese representative said that Japan will try to ease controls on its foreign trade.

Soviet representative Spanderyan said that in order to develop trade, it is necessary to expand and consolidate the connections between representatives of the business community of various countries by holding exhibitions and fairs, sending trade and economic delegations, and so on. International chamber of commerce organizations can play a major role in strengthening the economic ties between countries in the region of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East and other countries in the world. This kind of chamber of commerce could specialize in studying the possibility of expanding trade.

Spanderyan said that the Soviet delegation particularly welcomes the holding of a meeting of trade experts in the Asian region. There is no doubt that this meeting will help develop trade relations between countries in the region of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East and other countries in the world.

The Soviet representative drew the attention of the meeting to the importance of concluding long-term contracts for countries in the region of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. He said that this kind of contract is a way to ensure the sale of goods. They will, to some extent, prevent the negative impact of shrinking demand and falling prices on the economies of countries in the region of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East.

The Soviet representative reiterated at the closing meeting on the 12th that the trade embargo against the People's Republic of China has brought significant losses to the economies of countries in the region of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. Spanderyan condemned the U.S. "embargo" policy for hindering the development of trade relations between China and countries in the region of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. At the same time, he pointed out that the subcommittee's final report did not reflect the main issues discussed by the subcommittee. These issues included the need to cooperate more closely with the People's Republic of China and the U.S. obstruction of the development of trade between countries around the world and China.

    亚洲及远东经济委员会贸易小组委员会会议闭幕
    苏联代表谴责美国对我国实行贸易禁运
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社讯：在香港举行的联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会贸易小组委员会会议在十二日闭幕。出席这次会议的代表们就各国的对外经济政策和在联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会地区发展贸易的可能性，交换了意见。
  巴基斯坦代表赛义德在讨论中发言提出了巴基斯坦产品销售方面的困难。他说，在一九五三—一九五四年中，巴基斯坦的对外贸易总额减少了四亿零二百八十万卢比。他说，出口量锐减的原因是，国外市场缩小使得原棉出口量下降。
    日本代表冲田说，发展国际贸易的必要的和先决的条件是停止对外贸易方面的歧视。他在这里所指的是日本所遭受的困难，大家知道，造成这种困难的原因主要是美国强迫日本限制它同民主阵营各国间的贸易，同时美国和英国对日本商品采取了歧视性的关税政策。日本代表说，日本将设法减轻对它的对外贸易的控制。
    苏联代表斯潘杰利安说，为了发展贸易，就必须通过举办展览会和博览会、派遣贸易和经济代表团等等方法来扩大和巩固各国企业界代表之间的联系。为了加强亚洲及远东经济委员会地区国家同世界其他国家间的经济联系，国际性商会组织可以起重大的作用。这种商会可以专门来研究扩大贸易的可能性。
    斯潘杰利安说，苏联代表团特别欢迎举行亚洲地区贸易专家会议。毫无疑问，这种会议将有助于发展亚洲及远东经济委员会地区国家同世界其他国家之间的贸易关系。
    苏联代表提请会议注意缔结长期合同的方式对于亚洲及远东经济委员会地区国家的重要性。他说，这种合同是使货品销售得到保证的办法。它们将在某种程度上防止需求的缩减和价格的下降对亚洲及远东经济委员会地区国家经济所造成的消极影响。
    苏联代表在十二日的闭幕会议上再次指出，对中华人民共和国实行的贸易禁运给联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会地区国家的经济带来了重大损失。斯潘杰利安谴责美国的“禁运”政策阻碍中国和亚洲及远东经济委员会地区国家间发展贸易关系。同时他指出，小组委员会的最后报告中没有反映出小组委员会所讨论的主要问题。这些问题中包括必须同中华人民共和国更密切地合作以及美国阻挠世界各国同中国发展贸易等问题。
