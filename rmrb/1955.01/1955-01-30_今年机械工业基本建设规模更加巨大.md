This year, the scale of basic construction in China's machinery industry is even more immense. The basic construction tasks have increased by about 40% compared to last year. There are 160 new construction and renovation projects. Among them, more than 30 factories will be newly built, and 80 factories will be renovated. The number of key projects has also increased from 12 last year to 22. These 22 key projects account for more than 86% of the total investment in factories.

Among the 12 key projects under construction last year, in addition to the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory and the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory, which have been completed and put into production, five more units including the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, the Harbin Electrical Machinery Factory, and the Harbin Electric Meter Instrument Factory will be completed this year; and five units will undergo comprehensive construction. Among them, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant will enter the peak of equipment installation, and the Tractor Manufacturing Plant will begin comprehensive construction of factory buildings.

This year, many newly built or renovated factories will also be completed or undergo large-scale construction. These include heavy machinery factories, ball bearing factories, low-voltage switch factories, boiler factories, and steam turbine factories.

In addition, the petroleum machinery manufacturing plant that produces complete sets of petroleum equipment, the locomotive manufacturing plant that produces large new-style locomotives, and the manufacturing plants that produce heavy-duty machine tools and mining machinery will also begin construction of auxiliary projects this year and vigorously prepare for comprehensive construction next year.

Currently, the relevant units of the First Ministry of Machine Building are strengthening various preparatory works before construction, striving to comprehensively and evenly complete the state construction plan starting from the first quarter.

    今年机械工业基本建设规模更加巨大
    今年我国机械工业基本建设规模更加巨大。基本建设任务比去年增加百分之四十左右。新建、改建的单位有一百六十个。其中将新建三十多个工厂，改建八十个工厂。重点工程也由去年的十二个增加到二十二个。这二十二个重点工程占工厂总投资额的百分之八十六强。
    去年建设的十二个重点工程中，除沈阳风动工具厂、哈尔滨量具刃具厂等已经建成并开始生产外，今年还将有沈阳第一机床厂、哈尔滨电机厂、哈尔滨电表仪器厂等五个单位建设完工；有五个单位进行全面建设。其中第一汽车制造厂将进入设备安装的高潮，拖拉机制造厂将开始厂房工程的全面施工。
    今年还将有许多新建或改建的工厂建设完工或进行大规模施工。其中包括重型机器厂、滚珠轴承厂、低压开关厂、锅炉厂、汽轮机厂等。
    此外，生产全套石油设备的石油机械制造厂，生产大型新式机车的机车制造厂以及生产重工具机、矿山机械等制造厂也将在今年开始附属工程的施工，并大力为明年的全面施工做好准备。
    现在第一机械工业部各有关单位正在加强施工前的各项准备工作，它们要争取从第一季度开始就能全面地、均衡地完成国家的建设计划。
