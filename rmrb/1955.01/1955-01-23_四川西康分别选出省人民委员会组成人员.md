At this session, Chen Shufang was also elected as a deputy to the First National People's Congress.

The session discussed and reviewed the report on the main work situation in the nearly five months since the First Session of the First People's Congress of Sichuan Province and the report on the industrial and agricultural production tasks for 1955, both made by Li Jingquan, Chairman of the former Sichuan Provincial People's Government. The report shows that in 1954, the total output value of local state-owned and joint state-private industries in the province exceeded the original plan by 108 percent. In terms of developing agricultural producers' cooperatives, 8,041 new cooperatives were developed on the basis of the original 625 old cooperatives, and 270,000 new mutual aid teams were also developed. Driven by the agricultural producers' cooperatives, the province's farmers overfulfilled the 1954 agricultural production increase plan, with grain production increasing by 6.66 percent compared with 1953, and cotton production increasing by 18 percent. The planned purchase and supply of grain and the planned purchase of cotton, which began in September last year, were also successfully completed on December 10th. The session determined the industrial and agricultural production tasks for Sichuan Province in 1955. This year, the province requires a 3 percent increase in grain production, a 15 percent increase in cotton production, and a 19 percent increase in oilseed crops. Local industry must implement the policy of serving agriculture and integrating with the agricultural economy.

During the discussions, the representatives put forward many concrete opinions to ensure the completion of the tasks, and criticized the shortcomings in the government's work. Some responsible cadres of the various departments of the Provincial People's Government also made self-criticisms at the meeting regarding the shortcomings and errors in their past work.

The Second Session of the First People's Congress of Xikang Province was held in Ya'an from January 15th to 19th. 101 representatives from seven ethnic groups, including Han, Tibetan, Yi, Hui, and Lisu, attended the session.

The session elected the members of the Xikang Provincial People's Committee. Liao Zhigao (Han) was elected Governor of Xikang Province, and Bai Ren (Han), Sangji Yuexi (Tibetan), Kang Naier (Han), Zhang Weijiong (Han), Guoji Mugu (Yi), and Xia Ke Daodeng (Tibetan) were elected Vice Governors.

The session also elected Liu Changjian as President of the Xikang Provincial Higher People's Court.

The session heard Zhang Weijiong's report on the spirit of the First Session of the First National People's Congress. The session also heard and discussed the report on the development of agricultural production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Xikang Province in 1955.
