The decorated train that departed from Chengdu at 2:00 PM on New Year's Eve arrived at Guangyuan Station at 10:00 AM on New Year's Day. The Chengdu-Guangyuan section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is now officially open to traffic.

On the morning of New Year's Day, people flocked from all directions to Guangyuan Station. More than 55,000 people from all walks of life in Guangyuan held a grand celebration rally for the opening of the railway. Representatives from Sichuan, Shaanxi, Chongqing, Chengdu, and counties along the railway also attended the meeting. Yu Jitang, Vice Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial People's Government, cut the ribbon at the meeting. At this moment, the whistle sounded for a long time, and the decorated train with Chairman Mao's portrait slowly entered the station, and the crowd cheered.

Guangyuan is the gateway for traffic between the Southwest and Northwest regions. The opening of the Chengdu-Guangyuan section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is of great importance for the exchange of goods between the Southwest and Northwest and for supporting the Guangyuan-north section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway.

    宝成铁路成都广元段通车
    除夕下午二时从成都出发的扎彩列车，在元旦上午十时到达广元站。宝成铁路成都到广元段从此正式通车。
    元旦清晨，人们成群结队从各处赶到广元车站。广元各界五万五千多人在这里举行了盛大的庆祝通车典礼大会。参加大会的还有四川、陕西、重庆、成都和铁路沿线各县的代表。四川省人民政府副主席余际唐在大会上剪彩。这时汽笛长鸣，挂着毛主席像的彩车徐徐驶进车站，人群欢声雷动。
    广元是西南、西北地区来往交通的门户。宝成铁路成都到广元段通车后，对西南、西北的物资交流和支援宝成铁路南段广元以北的工程有重要作用。
