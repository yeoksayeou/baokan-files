    Since our People's Liberation Army liberated Yijiangshan Island in one fell swoop, the U.S. aggressive bloc is plotting a new conspiracy regarding the armed occupation of our country's territory, Taiwan. On the one hand, it is intensifying its naval and air military operations in the Taiwan area, carrying out war provocations, and on the other hand, it is feigning peace and instigating the United Nations to carry out a so-called ceasefire plot to obstruct our people from liberating Taiwan. This new conspiracy is very vicious. Its purpose is to deceive world public opinion, attempting to shirk the responsibility for provoking war, and forcibly make the Chinese people tolerate the U.S. occupation of Taiwan in order to realize its ambition of encompassing Asia and dominating the world. Our Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai issued a statement on January 24, sternly condemning this new conspiracy of the U.S. aggressive bloc, and on behalf of our 600 million people, solemnly declared once again: "The Government of the People's Republic of China absolutely cannot agree to implement a so-called ceasefire with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique that has been spurned by the Chinese people." "The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, the United States must stop interfering in China's internal affairs, and all U.S. armed forces must withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait." I, representing all members of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, warmly support Premier Zhou's statement and resolutely oppose the orchestration of the so-called ceasefire plot.

    What does the so-called ceasefire mean? It is very clear: First of all, it means that our people must stop liberating Taiwan and abandon national sovereignty and territorial integrity; secondly, it means that our people must tolerate the long-term U.S. occupation of Taiwan and the protection of the Chiang bandits' restoration; thirdly, it means that our people must recognize the so-called "two Chinas" and split China's territory. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has long been abandoned by the people of the whole country, and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique must be completely eliminated in order to protect the security of the country and ease the tension in Asia and the world. If we accept the so-called ceasefire plotted by the U.S. aggressive bloc, it would be selling out the territory of the People's Republic of China, selling out the interests of the 600 million people, and forcibly making our people recognize the so-called "U.S.-Chiang Mutual Defense Treaty," allowing the United States to draw its defense line on our country's territory as a springboard for invading our mainland and launching a new war. Isn't this very clear?

    It can be seen that this kind of ceasefire plot is, from beginning to end, interfering in our internal affairs, dividing our territory, and preparing for a new war. The U.S. aggressive bloc and its followers are actively plotting this kind of trick, not only disregarding the will of our people, but also violating the Charter of the United Nations. Article 2, Paragraph 7 of the United Nations Charter clearly stipulates: "Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state or shall require the Members to submit such matters to settlement under the present Charter." Taiwan is our country's territory, and liberating Taiwan is our country's sovereignty and internal affair, which essentially falls under the domestic jurisdiction of our country. The United Nations has absolutely no right to interfere, and other countries have no right to interfere. Anyone who helps plan the so-called ceasefire is serving the U.S. war policy. Isn't this also very clear?

    In short, the U.S. aggressive bloc and its followers' plotting of the so-called ceasefire is completely a deception that reverses black and white. Eisenhower's peaceful gesture is just a disguise for the aggressors to prepare for a new war. The long-tested Chinese people will not be fooled. The Chinese people's will to liberate Taiwan is unshakable. We absolutely cannot tolerate any so-called ceasefire plot that attempts to interfere in our internal affairs and divide our territory of Taiwan, and we resolutely oppose it to the end.

    坚决反对美国策动联合国进行所谓停火的诡计
    中国农工民主党主席  章伯钧
    自从我国人民解放军一举解放一江山岛以后，美国侵略集团对于武装侵占我国领土台湾，正在策划一个新的阴谋，即一面加紧在台湾地区的海空军事行动，进行战争挑衅，一面伪装和平，策动联合国进行所谓停火的诡计，来阻挠我国人民解放台湾。这个新的阴谋诡计是很恶毒的。它的目的是想欺骗世界舆论，妄图推卸挑拨战争的罪责，强使中国人民容忍美国侵占台湾，以实现它囊括亚洲、独霸世界的野心。我国周恩来总理兼外交部长曾于一月二十四日发表声明，严正地斥责了美国侵略集团这个新的阴谋诡计，并代表我六万万人民再一次庄严地宣告：“中华人民共和国政府绝对不能同意同中国人民所唾弃了的蒋介石卖国集团实行所谓停火。”“中国人民必须解放台湾，美国必须停止对中国内政的干涉，美国的一切武装力量必须从台湾和台湾海峡撤走。”我代表中国农工民主党全体成员热烈拥护周总理的声明，坚决反对策动所谓停火诡计。
    所谓停火是意味着什么呢？非常明显：首先是要我国人民停止解放台湾，放弃国家主权和领土的完整；其次是要我国人民容忍美国长期侵占台湾，庇护蒋贼复辟；再次是要我国人民承认所谓“两个中国”，分裂中国领土。蒋介石卖国集团早已为全国人民所共弃，必须彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团，才能保卫国家的安全，缓和亚洲和全世界的紧张局势。如果接受美国侵略集团策划的所谓停火，就是出卖中华人民共和国的国土，出卖六万万人民的利益，就是要强使我国人民承认美蒋“共同防御条约”，允许美国把国防线划在我国领土之上，作为侵占我国大陆的跳板，发动新的战争。这难道不是很明白的吗？
    由此可见，这种停火诡计，彻头彻尾是干涉我国内政，割裂我国领土，准备新的战争。美国侵略集团和它的追随者积极策划这种诡计，不但蔑视我国人民的意志，而且违反联合国的宪章。联合国宪章第二条第七款明确规定：“本宪章不得认为授权联合国干涉在本质上属于任何国家国内管辖之事件，且并不要求会员国将该项事件依本宪章提请解决”。台湾是我国的领土，解放台湾是我国的主权和内政，这在本质上属于我国国内管辖的事件，联合国完全无权干涉，其他国家也无权过问。一切帮助策划所谓停火者，就是为美国战争政策服务。这难道不也是很明白的吗？
    总之，美国侵略集团和它的追随者策划所谓停火，完全是一个颠倒黑白的欺骗。艾森豪威尔做出的和平姿态，只是侵略者准备新的战争的伪装。久经锻炼的中国人民是不会上当的。中国人民解放台湾的意志是不可动摇的。一切企图干涉我国内政、割裂我国领土台湾的所谓停火诡计，我们是绝对不能容忍的，我们是坚决反对到底的。
