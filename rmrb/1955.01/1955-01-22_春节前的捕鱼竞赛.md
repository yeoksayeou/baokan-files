The Dalian Aquatic Products Company plans to supply the market with 350 tons of fresh fish and shrimp before the Spring Festival. The sailors fishing at sea have launched a heated labor competition to realize this plan. After the fishing boat of Liu Zhixian, a special-class labor model in Dalian, overfulfilled its production plan of 250 boxes on the 14th, it immediately went back to sea.

In the past month, fishermen in Lushun have caught a large number of fresh fish, and have also hauled in 6,000 catties of sea cucumbers, which will be dried and supplied to the people of major cities.

    春节前的捕鱼竞赛
    旅大市水产公司计划在春节前以三百五十吨新鲜鱼虾供应市场。在海上捕鱼的船员们，为了实现这个计划，已经热烈地开展劳动竞赛。旅大市特等劳动模范刘治先的渔船，在十四日超额完成了二百五十箱的生产计划以后，马上又到海上去了。
    最近一个月来，旅顺的渔民们捕获了大批鲜鱼，另外还拉了六千斤海参，准备晒干以后供给各大城市的人民。
