Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 5th: Pastukhov published an article in "Pravda" entitled "The Upcoming Asian-African Conference," commenting on the results of the recent meeting of the Prime Ministers of the five Southeast Asian countries in Bogor.

Pastukhov mentioned that an important item on the meeting's agenda was the question of which countries should be invited to attend the Asian-African Conference. He pointed out that before the meeting, the United States exerted pressure on the governments of certain Southeast Asian countries to oppose the participation of the People's Republic of China in the Asian-African Conference.

He continued by saying that the results of the Bogor Conference showed that the intrigues of American diplomacy suffered a major defeat, and the representatives of the Southeast Asian countries demonstrated a realistic understanding of the international situation: the meeting decided to hold a conference of Asian-African countries, with the participation of the People's Republic of China, in Bandung, Indonesia, in April 1955. The communique issued by the five Prime Ministers' meeting stated that the purpose of the Asian-African Conference was to promote world peace and the economic and social development of Africa and Asia. It would also discuss a number of specific issues, including colonialism, racism, and national sovereignty.

Pastukhov also said that the importance of the Bogor Conference lies in the fact that it demonstrated the desire of the Asian peoples to decide their own destiny. The resolutions of the conference showed that Asian problems cannot be resolved without the participation of the great Chinese people. At the same time, it also demonstrated the increasingly high tide of the Asian peoples' struggle for full national independence, against colonialism, racial discrimination, and economic enslavement.

Pastukhov pointed out that public opinion in Asian and African countries warmly supports the resolutions of the Bogor Conference. He said that this meeting has caused panic in Washington and London. Therefore, the Jakarta correspondent of the United Press estimated that the invitation of the People's Republic of China to the Asian-African Conference was a serious blow to American policy.

In London, as reported by "The Daily Telegraph" and "Morning Post," people are worried that the upcoming conference will boost the national liberation movement in Africa.

Pastukhov wrote that in order to intimidate Asian and African countries from participating in the upcoming conference, the American propaganda machine has repeatedly brandished the fabricated "communist threat" as a scarecrow, demanding that these countries organize "self-defense against communism." But the effectiveness of these intimidations is diminishing.

The peoples of Asia and Africa believe that the Asian-African Conference will certainly contribute to the maintenance of lasting peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 6th: The Czechoslovakian "Red Right" newspaper commented on the Bogor Conference's decision to convene an Asian-African conference on the 5th, saying that the results of the Bogor Conference further strengthened the advocacy of peaceful coexistence and Asian collective security.

The commentary said that Asian countries, which are increasingly striving to control their own destiny, have growing confidence in the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

The commentary considered the decision to invite China to participate in the upcoming Asian-African Conference to be of great significance. The commentary said that without a doubt, the results of the Bogor Conference are a heavy blow to the prestige of the United States and its imperialist policies in Asia, because this result means rejecting the US policy of discriminating against the People's Republic of China, which is a clear answer from Asian countries to the imperialists' interference in Asian affairs.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 6th: "Daily Review" commented on the Bogor Conference's decision to convene an Asian-African conference in its international commentary column on the 5th, saying that the significance of the Asian-African Conference can be clearly seen from its geographical scope, which includes two continents and about half of the world's population. However, the significance of this conference is not limited to this. The agenda of the Asian-African Conference is extremely realistic and important, as it will discuss the issue of peaceful coexistence, strengthening international cooperation, and consolidating world peace. It will also discuss the issue of colonialism, and the elimination of colonialism is in line with the interests of peace. The commentary said that the United States and its followers plan to hold a meeting of the Manila Treaty Group in Bangkok in February, attempting to strengthen this Asian version of the Atlantic Treaty Group's aggressiveness. However, this attempt by Washington to intensify the suppression of national liberation movements will make the people of Asia and Africa more aware of the need to resolutely jointly defend their own interests.

    苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、民主德国报纸评茂物会议的结果
    指出亚非会议有助于持久和平的维持
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科五日讯：帕斯图霍夫在“真理报”上发表了一篇题为“将要召开的亚非会议”的文章，评论东南亚五国总理最近在茂物举行的会议的结果。
    帕斯图霍夫提到，会议议程中的重要一项是关于应当邀请哪些国家参加亚非会议的问题。他指出，在会议之前，美国就对某些东南亚国家政府施加压力，要它们反对中华人民共和国参加亚非会议。
    他接着说，茂物会议的结果表明，美国外交的阴谋诡计遭到了大失败，东南亚国家的代表们表现了对国际形势的现实的理解：会议已经决定在一九五五年四月在印度尼西亚万隆召开一次有中华人民共和国参加的亚非国家的会议。五国总理会议发表的公报说，亚非会议的目的是促进世界和平和非洲和亚洲的经济和社会的发展。它也将讨论若干具体问题，包括殖民主义、种族主义和民族主权的问题。
    帕斯图霍夫又说，茂物会议的重要性是在于它表现了亚洲各国人民自行决定他们命运的愿望。会议的决议表明，亚洲问题没有伟大的中国人民参加是解决不了的。同时，它也表明了亚洲各国人民为了争取充分的民族独立、反对殖民主义、种族歧视和经济奴役而进行的越来越高涨的斗争。
    帕斯图霍夫指出，亚洲和非洲各国的舆论热烈支持茂物会议的决议。他说，这次会议已经引起了华盛顿和伦敦的惊慌。因此，合众社驻雅加达记者把邀请中华人民共和国参加亚非会议估计为对于美国政策的一个严重的打击。
    在伦敦，正如“每日电讯报”和“晨邮报”所报道的那样，人们怀着这样的忧虑：将要举行的会议会使非洲的民族解放运动高涨起来。
    帕斯图霍夫写道，为了恐吓亚洲和非洲的国家不让它们参加将要举行的会议，美国的宣传机器一再挥舞着它捏造出来的“共产党的威胁”这个吓唬人的幌子，要求这些国家组织“自卫以抵抗共产主义”。但是这些恐吓的效力越来越少了。
    亚洲和非洲的各国人民相信：亚非会议必将有助于持久和平的维持。
   【新华社布拉格六日电】捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”五日评论茂物会议关于召开亚非会议的决定说，茂物会议的结果进一步加强了和平共处主张和亚洲集体安全。
    评论说，正在越来越坚强地努力把自己的命运掌握在手中的亚洲国家对于和平共处的五项原则的信心日益增长。
    评论认为关于邀请中国参加即将举行的亚非会议的决定具有重大的意义。评论说，毫无疑问，茂物会议的结果是对美国的威信和它在亚洲的帝国主义政策的一个沉重的打击，因为这种结果意味着拒绝美国歧视中华人民共和国的政策，这是亚洲国家对帝国主义者干涉亚洲事务的行为的一个清楚的答复。
   【新华社柏林六日电】“每日评论报”五日在国际评论栏中评论茂物会议关于召开亚非会议的决定说，亚非会议的意义从它的地理范围上来看就可以看得很清楚，它包括了两个大陆和约占地球上一半的人口。但是，这次会议的意义还不仅于此。亚非会议的议程具有极大的现实性和重要性，它将讨论和平共处的问题、加强国际合作和巩固世界和平的问题。它还将讨论殖民主义的问题，消除殖民主义是符合于和平的利益的。评论说，美国和它的追随者计划二月间在曼谷召开马尼拉条约集团的会议，企图加强这个大西洋公约集团亚洲版的侵略性。但是，华盛顿的这种想要加紧镇压民族解放运动的企图，将使亚洲和非洲人民更加认识到坚决共同保卫他们自身利益的必要性。
