Chongqing held a Workers' Art and Performance Festival. The grand gathering, after nineteen days of performances and evaluations, concluded on January 1st. One thousand three hundred and seventy-six amateur worker-performers from fifty-one grassroots units presented ninety-four programs of ballads, dramas, dances, and other forms of art, of which twenty-five were original creations by the workers themselves. Seven programs, including "Red Flags Flying on the Jialing River" from Factory 102 and "Such a Discussion Meeting" from the Chongqing Public Bus Company, received creation awards, and twenty-seven individuals received individual awards. Their performances were full of the flavor of life and fighting spirit, demonstrating the workers' love for art and rich creative talents. This festival will promote the better development of amateur worker art activities throughout the city.
