    Glorious Work of Supporting the Army and Giving Preferential Treatment to Families of Soldiers
    During the Spring Festival, the people of the whole country are actively carrying out the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers, and extending regards to the wounded and sick of the People's Army, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and families of martyrs and soldiers. During this period, we must review and summarize the work of preferential treatment in 1954, arrange the work of preferential treatment in 1955, earnestly solve the existing problems in the current work of preferential treatment, and conscientiously do a good job in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers. This is a very glorious task.
    When we are celebrating the Spring Festival, our enemies are deliberately undermining our socialist construction and attempting to use our territory of Taiwan as a springboard for invading our mainland. In order to consolidate national defense, safeguard peace, and liberate Taiwan, we must have a strong and modern People's Army. Doing a good job in providing preferential treatment is an important measure to consolidate the People's Army. Whoever neglects this work will intentionally or unintentionally hinder the further consolidation of the People's Army.
    Since 1954, with the development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement, a large proportion of families of martyrs and soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers in various places have participated in production and mutual aid and cooperation organizations; in many areas, the number of families of martyrs and soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers participating in mutual aid and cooperation organizations has increased by nearly 20% compared with 1953. According to the statistics of 1,638 villages in 22 counties of Hubei Province: Among 24,039 households of families of martyrs and soldiers, 15,099 households participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, accounting for more than 63% of the total number of households of families of martyrs and soldiers. In cities, there has also been a large increase in organizing them to engage in cooperative production or family handicraft production. According to incomplete statistics from eight cities including Beijing and Shanghai, 333 new small production groups were formed in 1954, absorbing 3,801 people to participate in production. Many rural areas have rectified the work of tilling fields on behalf of soldiers' families, adjusted the burden of tilling fields on behalf of soldiers' families, and overcome some confusion in this work. The form of combining the work of tilling fields on behalf of soldiers' families with mutual aid and cooperation organizations has also greatly developed. The method of tilling fields on behalf of soldiers' families by mutual aid and cooperation organizations has gradually replaced the previous method of tilling fields on behalf of soldiers' families by scattered individual farmers, which has greatly strengthened the planning of the work of tilling fields on behalf of soldiers' families and overcome the difficulties in scattered tilling by individual farmers. In the work of distributing living and production subsidies to families of martyrs and soldiers, some areas, in addition to providing regular and fixed subsidies to poor families of martyrs and soldiers who could not maintain their lives, also adopted the method of focusing on key distribution, which effectively solved the difficulties of families of martyrs and soldiers in lacking means of production and supported their participation in mutual aid and cooperation production. These new developments in the work of preferential treatment have enabled the production of families of martyrs and soldiers to develop, their lives have also been improved, and their enthusiasm for production and socialist awareness have been rapidly improved.
    However, there are still many shortcomings in the work of preferential treatment. Generally speaking, this is the lack of comprehensiveness in implementing the policy of preferential treatment for families of martyrs and soldiers. Our comprehensive policy for preferential treatment is: we must not only mobilize families of martyrs and soldiers to participate in mutual aid and cooperation production, so as to give play to their own strength and gradually improve their lives through production, but also give them necessary assistance from the government and the masses. Organizing families of martyrs and soldiers to participate in mutual aid and cooperation production is the main method, but this cannot solve all the difficulties of families of martyrs and soldiers. Because some poor families of martyrs and soldiers do not have the conditions to participate in production and cannot maintain their lives, the government must issue regular and fixed living allowances. Also, some families of martyrs and soldiers have land and labor or semi-labor, but lack means of production, so we must help them solve the difficulties of livestock and farm tools, so that they can participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations. For some families of martyrs and soldiers who have no labor or lack labor, we must organize the masses to till the land on their behalf. To do a comprehensive job in giving preferential treatment to families of martyrs and soldiers, we must regard this series of tasks as an organic whole, and not grasp one point and abandon the others.
    Many areas have not fully understood and grasped this principle, and as a result, various deviations have occurred in their work. Some have achieved great success in organizing families of martyrs and soldiers to participate in mutual aid and cooperation, but have neglected the correct distribution and use of living and production subsidies; some have paid attention to the distribution of production subsidies, but have neglected the distribution of living subsidies to poor families of martyrs and soldiers; some have neglected the necessary work of tilling fields on behalf of soldiers' families, thinking that since families of martyrs and soldiers have participated in production, there is no need to till fields on their behalf, and therefore prematurely canceled the tilling of fields on their behalf, causing insurmountable difficulties for families of martyrs and soldiers and affecting their enthusiasm for production. In addition, some areas have neglected to mobilize families of martyrs and soldiers to participate in mutual aid and cooperation. There are also many places where there is a backlog or misappropriation of funds for preferential treatment, which is very serious in some places. According to statistics in Lin County, Henan Province, in September 1954, the amount of backlog reached 2 billion yuan. Shou County, Anhui Province, is a disaster-stricken county, but from January to September last year, only 41.5% of the annual funds for preferential treatment were used, and Su County only used 33.4%. Some places have misappropriated funds for preferential treatment for purposes such as repairing sewers and building auditoriums. In these areas, on the one hand, the funds for preferential treatment are backlogged or misappropriated, and on the other hand, the difficulties in the lives and production of families of martyrs and soldiers have not been well resolved. This shows that many state organ staff members do not have a strong mass viewpoint and do not care enough about families of martyrs and soldiers. Some local civil affairs departments only pay attention to business and do not pay attention to finance, emphasizing that the civil affairs department is not an accounting unit at one level, so they leave a lot of money in the financial department and do not care about it. At the same time, some financial units receive the appropriation but do not notify the civil affairs department in time. Some places do not proactively and planfully use the funds for the cause, but issue them when they come to the door, and do not issue them if they do not come. Some places do not have a sufficient understanding of the actual situation of families of martyrs and soldiers, and allocate too much money to places where the problem is not big and the need for money is not great, which is also a reason for the backlog. Some local party and government leaders do not check and supervise, and even decide to misappropriate. These practices are all wrong and must be corrected seriously.
    This year, agricultural mutual aid and cooperation organizations will have a large development, and we must continue to mobilize families of martyrs and soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers to participate in mutual aid and cooperation. This is a task that must be done well before spring plowing. At the same time, we must also assess and issue regular and fixed living allowances for families of martyrs and soldiers, the standard of which should be higher than the relief standard for ordinary poor people in the local area, and the subsidies for families of martyrs should be more generous. In disaster areas, we should especially care about the difficulties of families of martyrs and soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers. When assessing and issuing relief funds, we should give them more preferential treatment than ordinary disaster victims, and we should not stop issuing necessary living allowances to families of martyrs and soldiers just because we have issued relief funds. According to the experience of some places last year, the issuance of production subsidies should be planned, prepared, and focused, ensuring that the recipients use the funds to purchase livestock, farm tools, and establish household affairs, and should solve the problem as much as possible at one time. In this way, solving the problems of a part of the needy households every year can strive to basically solve the production difficulties of all families of martyrs and soldiers in three to five years. In terms of tilling fields on behalf of soldiers' families, we should promote the method of tilling fields on behalf of soldiers' families by mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives, and as much as possible absorb families of martyrs and soldiers to participate in mutual aid groups or agricultural production cooperatives that undertake the tilling of fields on behalf of soldiers' families. At the same time, we should educate the members of mutual aid and cooperation organizations to welcome families of martyrs and soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers to join the groups and cooperatives. The rural party and government leading organs should list this work as a part of the rural organization of production work, and instruct the civil affairs department to make it one of the key tasks, and be sure to do it well.
    In cities, in addition to introducing jobs to families of martyrs and soldiers and issuing living and production subsidies to families of martyrs and soldiers, we must also mobilize and support them to participate in handicraft production cooperatives, or organize them to engage in various feasible small-scale production and family handicraft production. This kind of production should serve the basic construction and industrial and agricultural production according to local conditions, as an auxiliary force for large-scale production. Some cities have made achievements in this area in 1954, and we should continue to move forward in this direction in the future. The urban party and government leading organs should list this work as a part of the urban organization of production work, and the trade departments, cooperatives, and various factories and mining enterprises should do their best to support and cooperate with the civil affairs department in charge of preferential treatment, and the civil affairs department should also actively contact these departments to do a good job in organizing the production of families of martyrs and soldiers.
    In order to resolutely overcome the phenomenon of a large backlog of funds for preferential treatment and thus hinder the development of work, the civil affairs department must improve the management of funds for preferential treatment, strictly implement the financial management system, eliminate corruption, waste, misappropriation, blind appropriation, and improper use, etc. In addition to the regular distribution of living allowances to poor families of martyrs and soldiers, all localities should strive to invest most of the subsidies used to help poor families of martyrs and soldiers solve the difficulties of means of production in the first half of the year, so as to facilitate the production of families of martyrs and soldiers to play a role in the same year. In the process of work, families of martyrs and soldiers should be registered, classified according to different situations, and used as the basis for specifically helping them solve problems.
    The key to doing a good job in providing preferential treatment lies in strengthening the national defense education, current affairs education, and patriotic education of cadres and the masses, raising the vigilance of cadres and the masses, seeing the imperialists' aggressive ambitions, and recognizing the practical significance of doing a good job in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers for consolidating national defense. We must use the heroic deeds of the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and their noble patriotic spirit, to educate cadres and the masses, and we must also strengthen the education of families of martyrs and soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers, improve their socialist awareness, give play to their enthusiasm for production and political enthusiasm, and encourage them to strive for greater glory.

### 光荣的拥军优属工作

    光荣的拥军优属工作
    在春节期间，全国人民正在积极开展拥军优属工作，慰问人民军队的伤病员、革命残废军人和烈属军属。在这期间，我们必须检查总结一九五四年的优抚工作，布置一九五五年的优抚工作，认真解决当前优抚工作中存在的问题，切实做好拥军优属工作。这是一项非常光荣的工作。
    当我们欢度春节的时候，我们的敌人正在蓄意破坏我们的社会主义建设事业，并且企图以我国领土台湾作为侵略我国大陆的跳板。为了巩固国防，捍卫和平和解放台湾，我们必须有一支坚强的和现代化的人民军队。作好优抚工作，就是巩固人民军队的重要措施。谁忽视了这一工作，谁就会有意无意地妨害了人民军队的进一步巩固。
    一九五四年以来，随着农村互助合作运动的发展，各地都有很大部分的烈属军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人参加了生产和互助合作的组织；有不少地区参加互助合作组织的烈属军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人，比一九五三年增加了将近百分之二十。湖北省二十二个县一千六百三十八乡的统计：烈属、军属二万四千零三十九户，参加互助合作组织的有一万五千零九十九户，占烈属军属总户数的百分之六十三强。在城市，组织他们从事合作社性质的生产或者家庭手工业生产的也大有增多。据北京、上海等八个市的不完全统计，一九五四年新组成的小型生产小组就有三百三十三个，吸收了三千八百零一人参加生产。许多农村整顿了代耕工作，调整了代耕负担，克服了这一工作中的某些混乱现象。代耕工作和互助合作组织相结合的形式也有了很大的发展。由互助合作组织实行代耕的办法，逐步代替了已往由分散的个别农户代耕的办法，使代耕工作的计划性大大加强，克服了个别农户分散代耕中的困难。在烈属军属生活和生产补助费的发放工作上，有些地区除对贫苦的无法维持生活的烈属军属给予了定期定量的补助以外，并采取了重点发放的办法，有效地解决了烈属军属们缺乏生产资料的困难，支持了他们参加互助合作的生产。优抚工作上的这些新的发展，使得烈属军属的生产发展了，他们的生活也得到了改善，生产的积极性和社会主义觉悟也迅速提高了。
    但是优抚工作中仍然存在着许多的缺点。总起来说，这就是在执行优待烈属军属的政策上不够全面。我们优抚工作的全面政策是：既要发动烈属军属参加互助合作生产，以便发挥他们本身的力量，从生产中逐步改善他们的生活，又要由政府和群众给他们以必要的帮助。组织烈属军属参加互助合作生产是主要的办法，但这还不能解决烈属军属的全部困难。因为有一部分贫苦的烈属军属没有参加生产的条件，无法维持生活，因此就必须由政府发给定期定量的生活补助费。又有一部分烈属军属虽有土地和劳动力或半劳动力，但是缺乏生产资料，因此就必须帮助他们解决牲畜和农具等困难，使他们能够参加到互助合作组织里去。还有一部分没有劳动力或者缺少劳动力的烈属军属，则必须组织群众为他们代耕。要全面做好优待烈属军属的工作，就必须把这一系列的工作当作一个有机的整体，而不能抓住一点放弃其他。
    有许多地区因为没有完整地理解和掌握这一原则，结果就在工作中发生了各种偏向。有的在组织烈属军属参加互助合作方面很有成绩，但却忽视了正确地发放和使用生活及生产的补助费；有的地方注意了发放生产补助费，但又忽视了对贫苦的烈属军属生活补助费的发放；有的地方则忽视了必要的代耕工作，以为烈属军属既然参加了生产，就用不着代耕了，因而过早地取消了代耕，使烈属军属发生了不能克服的困难，影响了他们的生产积极性。另外有些地方则忽视了发动烈属军属参加互助合作。还有不少地方积压或挪用优抚事业费的现象，某些地方则非常严重。河南省林县一九五四年九月统计，积压款项竟达二十亿元。安徽省寿县是重灾县，但去年一月份至九月份只用去全年优抚事业费的百分之四十一点五，宿县只用去百分之三十三点四。有的地方把优抚事业费挪作修理下水道、修建礼堂等用途。在这些地区，一方面是优抚事业费被积压或挪用，另一方面烈属军属的生活和生产上的困难却并没有很好解决。这里表现出有许多国家机关工作人员群众观点不强，对烈属军属不够关心。有些地方的民政部门只注意业务，不注意财务，强调民政部门不是一级会计单位，就让大量的钱存在财政部门，不去过问。同时也有一些财政单位得到了拨款而不及时通知民政部门。有些地方不是主动地有计划地使用事业费，而是找上门来就发，不来就不发。有些地方对烈属军属实际情况了解不够，对问题不大和需钱不多的地方拨款太多，也是造成积压的原因。也有些地方的党政负责同志不加检查督促，甚至作主挪用。这些做法都是错误的，必须认真改正。
    今年农业互助合作组织将有大量的发展，我们必须继续动员烈属军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人参加互助合作，这是春耕以前必须做好的工作。同时，我们还必须评定并发放烈属军属定期定量生活补助费，其标准应较高于当地一般贫民的救济标准，而对烈属的补助则应当较为优厚。在灾区尤应关心烈属军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人的困难，在评定和发放救济款的时候，应给予他们比一般灾民较为优厚的照顾，而且不应因为发了救济款，就不再发给烈属军属以必要的生活补助费。生产补助费的发放，根据去年有些地方的经验，应当是有计划、有准备、有重点的，保证得款人把款用于购买牲畜、农具、建立家务，并应尽可能一次解决问题。这样，每年解决一部分困难户的问题，就可以争取在三年至五年内把全部烈属军属生产上的困难基本上求得解决。代耕方面，应当推广由互助组、农业生产合作社代耕的办法，并尽可能吸收烈属军属参加承担代耕的互助组或农业生产合作社。同时应当教育互助合作组织的成员欢迎烈属军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人入组和入社。农村党政领导机关应将此项工作列为农村组织生产工作的一部分，并责成民政部门作为工作的重点之一，一定要把它做好。
    城市中除了为烈属军属介绍职业、发放烈属军属生活生产补助费以外，还要动员和扶助他们参加手工业生产合作社，或者组织他们从事各种可行的小型生产和家庭手工业生产。这种生产应当根据当地的条件，为基本建设和工业农业生产服务，以作为大生产的一个辅助力量。一九五四年有些城市在这一方面已经做出成绩，今后仍应沿着这个方向前进。城市党政领导机关应将这项工作列为城市组织生产工作的一部分，贸易部门、合作社和各厂矿企业应当尽力支持和配合主管优抚工作的民政部门，民政部门也应当主动同这些部门联系，把组织烈属军属生产的工作做好。
    为了坚决克服优抚事业费大量积压因而妨碍工作开展的现象，民政部门必须健全优抚事业费的管理工作，严格执行财务管理制度，杜绝贪污、浪费、挪用和盲目拨款、使用不当等现象，各地除定期的发放贫苦烈属军属的生活补助费外，还应当把用于扶助贫苦烈属军属解决生产资料困难的补助费争取在上半年大部投放下去，以便于对烈属军属的生产在当年即发挥作用。在工作过程中，应对烈属军属进行登记，按照不同情况，加以分类排队，作为具体帮助他们解决问题的根据。
    做好优抚工作的关键，就在于加强干部和群众的国防教育、时事教育和爱国主义的教育，提高干部和群众的警惕性，看清帝国主义的侵略野心，认识到做好拥军优属工作对巩固国防的实际意义。我们必须用人民解放军、人民志愿军的英勇事迹，用他们的高尚的爱国主义精神，来教育干部和群众，同样也要加强对烈属军属、革命残废军人、复员建设军人的教育，提高他们的社会主义觉悟，发挥他们的生产积极性和政治积极性，鼓励他们争取更大的光荣。
