    Ma Jingsheng, an excellent member of the Communist Youth League in Sanhe Village, Chengde County, Rehe Province, bravely exposed the behavior of a rich peasant who sabotaged the agricultural production cooperative, and was praised by the peasants of the entire village.
    During the spring plowing season last year, Ma Jingsheng mobilized his family and the members of his mutual aid team to join the agricultural production cooperative. Everyone agreed at the time, except for team member Zhao Gui, who was unwilling to join the cooperative, and also said many things expressing dissatisfaction with the cooperative. His work enthusiasm also slackened. Zhao Gui said, "There's no benefit to joining the cooperative. Everything will be collectivized in the future, working won't be free, and it won't last long." When Ma Jingsheng heard these words at the time, he felt some suspicion in his heart. He thought there must be a problem here.
    During the summer weeding last year, the peasants were almost finished hoeing the first time, but Zhao Gui's land had not yet been hoed, and the weeds in the field were taller than the seedlings. At that time, the work in the mutual aid team was also very tight, but Zhao Gui often went to work for the rich peasant Cai Changpu. Zhao Gui's father also often went to Cai Changpu's house to eat and drink. The two families had very close relations. When Ma Jingsheng saw this situation, he thought to himself: Zhao Gui is unwilling to join the cooperative, his own land is being neglected, and instead he is going to hoe land for the rich peasant. He must have been won over by the rich peasant. I am a member of the Communist Youth League, and I should stand firm and not let the rich peasant prevent us from taking the socialist road. So he was determined to find out the situation and expose the sabotage activities of the rich peasant.
    After this, when Ma Jingsheng saw Zhao Gui and his son in the field, he patiently promoted the socialist vision to them, inspired them to recall and compare the differences between their past and present lives, and helped them understand the benefits of getting rid of the rich peasant's exploitation and taking the road to common prosperity. After being helped and educated many times by him, Zhao Gui's father also personally saw the various benefits of the cooperative and began to want to join the cooperative.
    When the rich peasant Cai Changpu learned of this, he hurriedly came out to obstruct it. He said to Zhao Gui's father, "Don't listen to their nonsense, you will suffer if you join the cooperative. We two can work together. If you don't have money, I'll give you money; if you don't have grain, I'll give you grain. With my family property, I certainly won't let you suffer." The rich peasant also tried to win over Ma Jingsheng, saying, "Silly child, there's no benefit to joining the cooperative. Look, I have plenty of draft animals and farm tools. It would be good for me to work with you." At this time, Ma Jingsheng resolutely refused the rich peasant's enticements and inducements, and at the same time reported the situation to the village cadres in detail, exposing the rich peasant's shameful conspiracy.
    It turned out that the rich peasant Cai Changpu felt that after the peasants in the village joined the agricultural production cooperative, he would no longer be able to hire laborers for exploitation. Therefore, he hated the cooperative very much and often carried out instigation and wooing among the peasants, creating various rumors to sabotage the cooperative. Taking advantage of the fact that Zhao Gui and his son were short of money, he lent them some money, and at the same time used methods such as inviting them to dinner to entice and win them over, so that they were unwilling to join the cooperative. In addition, the rich peasant Cai Changpu also carried out instigation and wooing among the four middle peasant households in the Ma Jingyu mutual aid team in the village, causing the mutual aid team to be disorganized and disunited.
    After the truth about the rich peasant Cai Changpu was exposed, the class consciousness of the peasants in Sanhe Village was raised, and they demanded to join the agricultural production cooperative one after another. Recently, Zhao Gui and his son also signed up to join the cooperative. Zhao Gui's father said when he joined the cooperative: "Thanks to Ma Jingsheng and the village cadres for helping me to recognize and get rid of the rich peasant's trap early and embark on the good road of cooperativization."

### 青年团员马景盛勇敢地揭发富农的破坏活动

    青年团员马景盛勇敢地揭发富农的破坏活动
    新华社记者  翟树耀
    热河省承德县三合村有一个名叫马景盛的优秀青年团员，曾经勇敢揭发富农破坏农业生产合作社的行为，受到全村农民的赞扬。
    马景盛在去年春耕时曾动员他的家庭和他所在的互助组的组员参加农业生产合作社。当时大家都同意，只有组员赵贵不愿入社，而且还讲了许多不满意合作社的话，干活的劲头也松下来。赵贵说：“入社没有好处，将来什么都归公，干活不自由，闹不长。”马景盛当时听了这些话，心中就有些怀疑，他想这里面一定有问题。
    去年夏锄时，农民们都快铲完头遍地了，但是赵贵的地还没有开铲，地里的草长得比苗还高。当时互助组里的活计也很紧张，但赵贵反而常去给富农蔡长浦做工，赵贵的父亲也经常去蔡长浦家吃饭、喝酒，两家来往很密切。马景盛见了这种情形，心里就想：赵贵不愿入社，自己的地荒着，反而去给富农铲地，一定是受了富农的拉拢。自己是个青年团员，应该站稳立场，不让富农阻挡我们走社会主义的道路。于是他就决心要把这些情况弄清楚，揭发富农的破坏活动。
    这以后马景盛在地里见到赵贵父子时，就耐心地向他们宣传社会主义远景，启发他们回忆对比过去和现在不同的生活，帮助他们认识摆脱富农剥削，走大家富裕道路的好处。赵贵父亲经过他的多次帮助教育，也亲身看到合作社的种种好处，开始想入社。
    富农蔡长浦知道了这事就急忙出来阻挠，他对赵贵的父亲说：“别听他们胡说，你要入社就要遭殃。我们两人搭伙干，你没钱，我给钱；你没粮，我给粮；凭我这份家业，一定不会亏你。”富农一面又企图去拉拢马景盛，他说：“傻孩子，入社没好处，看我有的是耕畜和农具，我和你一起干好了。”这时马景盛坚决拒绝了富农的拉拢引诱，同时把情况源源本本地报告了村干部，揭发了富农的可耻阴谋。
    原来富农蔡长浦觉得村中农民参加了农业生产合作社后，他就没法再雇工进行剥削，因此对合作社非常仇恨，经常在农民中进行挑拨拉拢，制造各种破坏合作社的谣言。他趁赵贵父子缺钱时，借了一部分钱给他们，同时用请客吃饭等办法来引诱拉拢他们，使他们都不愿参加合作社。此外，富农蔡长浦还对本村马景玉互助组的四户中农也进行了挑拨、拉拢，使这个互助组人心涣散，互相不团结。
    在富农蔡长浦的真相被揭发后，三合村农民的阶级觉悟提高了，纷纷要求参加农业生产合作社。最近赵贵父子也报名入了社。赵贵的父亲在入社时说：“多亏马景盛和村干部帮助我及早认清和摆脱了富农的圈套，走上了合作化的好道路。”（新华社）
