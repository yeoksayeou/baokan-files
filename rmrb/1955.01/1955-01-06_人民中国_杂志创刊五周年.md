The Foreign Languages Press's "People's China" magazine, published exclusively for distribution abroad, has been warmly welcomed by progressive readers in various countries around the world since its inception five years ago.

"People's China" was first published in English on January 1, 1950, followed by Russian and Japanese editions. It now distributes 90,000 copies directly to 69 countries and regions each issue. Over the past five years, "People's China" has systematically reported on various social reforms and major political movements since the founding of New China, the activities and achievements of the Chinese people in socialist construction and socialist transformation, and the Chinese people's struggle to defend world peace. In five years, "People's China" has published more than 100 articles on literature and art, which have had a great impact abroad. "People's China"'s articles on China's history, geography, and customs, published specifically to help foreign readers understand China, have also been particularly well-received.

"People's China" maintains close contact with its vast readership in various countries. Since its inception, the editorial department has received more than 2,700 letters from readers in more than 50 countries. These letters are full of cheers for the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and construction achievements, and express their desire to oppose war and love peace. Ruth Bratley, a British mother of four, sent a small packet of flower seeds with a letter to the "People's China" editorial department in the summer of 1950, saying, "I hope these smiling faces of the flowers every year will remind us of our eternal friendship." The editorial department sent this packet of friendship flower seeds to the Xijiao Park. When this packet of flower seeds turned into a beautiful field of flowers in the park the following year, the editorial department took photos and sent them to this British friend.

    “人民中国”杂志创刊五周年
    外文出版社出版专在国外发行的“人民中国”杂志创刊五年以来，受到世界各国进步读者的热烈欢迎。
    “人民中国”在一九五零年一月一日以英文版创刊，接着又增出了俄文和日文版。现在每期直接在六十九个国家和地区发行九万份。五年来，“人民中国”曾系统地报道了新中国成立以来的各项社会改革和历次重大的政治运动，报道了中国人民在社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业中的各项活动和成就，以及中国人民的生活和为保卫世界和平而进行的斗争。五年间“人民中国”先后刊载了一百多篇有关文学、艺术方面的文章，在国外发生很大影响。“人民中国”专为帮助国外读者了解中国而刊载的有关我国历史、地理和风俗习惯的文章，也特别受到欢迎。
      “人民中国”和各国广大读者，有着密切的联系。创刊以来，编辑部曾收到五十多个国家的读者来信二千七百多封。这些来信都充满着对中国人民革命胜利和建设成就的欢呼，表达了他们反对战争，热爱和平的愿望。英国一位四个孩子的母亲露丝·勃拉特莱在一九五零年夏天给“人民中国”编辑部写的信中附来了一小包花籽，她说“希望这些花每年欢笑的脸就会提醒我们永矢勿忘的友谊”。编辑部把这包友谊的花籽，送给了西郊公园。当这包花籽第二年在公园里变成了一片美丽花朵时，编辑部拍了照片，寄给了这位英国友人。
   为了纪念“人民中国”创刊五周年，人民中国社将于六日起在北京举行纪念活动。
