Overcoming Disaster and Celebrating the Spring Festival
By our reporter Gao Changren

    On the eve of the Spring Festival, the ice and snow in the suburbs of Wuhan have begun to melt. People repairing the dike on the Zhang Gong Dike are working hard. The rhythmic sound of tampers is the triumphant song of people overcoming the once-in-a-century flood. One sunny afternoon, I visited the family of Huang Chuanqi, a member of the Qunli Agricultural Production Cooperative in Huiji District. Huang Chuanqi's home is located in Huangjiawan village at the foot of the Zhang Gong Dike. The large fields in front of the village, covered in residual snow, were all affected by floods last summer, and the low-lying areas in the distance were submerged in accumulated water for several months. The people of Wuhan defended the Zhang Gong Dike and stopped the floodwaters of the Yangtze River, but many crops were still submerged by the accumulated water within the dike, and grain production was reduced. The flood brought disaster to the people, but under the leadership of the Communist Party, people overcame the flood and launched a production and disaster relief campaign. In particular, the agricultural production cooperative demonstrated its superiority in flood control and production for disaster relief. The members actively produced, making up for the losses caused by the accumulated water. Let's take a look at the situation of the Huang Chuanqi family before the Spring Festival:

    In Huang Chuanqi's home, there is no sign of the disaster. Under the eaves are strings of cured and dried chicken, fish, and pork. His family's two piglets are sleeping under the haystack, and several chickens are walking around looking for food. Huang Chuanqi's four children are happily playing in the sunlight in front of the door, and a middle-aged woman is using a stone mortar to pound rice – she is Huang Chuanqi's wife.

    Huang Chuanqi sat down on a long bench in front of the door and pointed to the hanging fish and meat to answer my question: "Everything is ready for the Spring Festival. In addition to fish, meat, and chicken, we also bought four catties of brown sugar, persimmon cakes, and red dates a few days ago. We will also be busy making some Ciba and Dousi these days. The whole family has also made new underwear and jackets for this Spring Festival." I asked him if the government had also provided relief and support to them. He said, "The government has issued a lot of relief funds and loans to help the families in difficulty, but because our cooperative overcame the difficulties ourselves, we gave all these relief funds to the most needy families."

    It turned out that the Qunli Agricultural Production Cooperative was also heavily affected by the disaster. Although the members worked hard to drain the water and harvest the crops, saving most of the paddy fields, all the dry land was flooded. They responded to the government's call and converted twenty mu of deep-water paddy fields to grow taro and lotus root. After the water receded, in addition to rushing to plant late autumn crops, they also planted ten mu of vegetables in the dry land, and engaged in sideline production such as raising pigs, catching fish, and doing temporary work. In this way, the income of the members did not decrease. When Huang Chuanqi worked independently in 1953, even though it was a bumper harvest year, he only earned 6,000 catties of grain. This year, the income from agriculture and sideline businesses combined is equivalent to more than 7,000 catties of grain. Therefore, his family not only has enough New Year's goods and sufficient food for this Spring Festival, but also has a deposit of 500,000 yuan in the credit cooperative.

    "If it weren't for the Communist Party leading the people to overcome the flood, and the Party leading us to establish agricultural production cooperatives, how could we have such a satisfactory Spring Festival this year!" These were words filled with gratitude that Huang Chuanqi repeated several times during the conversation.

    战胜灾害欢度春节
    本报记者　高长任
    春节前夕，武汉市郊区的冰雪已经开始融化。张公堤上修堤的人们在紧张地劳动着。此起彼伏的打夯声，是人们战胜了百年未有的洪水的凯歌。在一个晴朗的下午，我访问了惠济区合作乡群力农业生产合作社社员黄传启的家庭。黄传启的家，就住在张公堤下的黄家大塆里。村前在残雪掩盖下的大片田地，夏天都曾遭受过水灾的侵害，远处的洼地，一连几个月都淹在积水中。武汉人民保卫住了张公堤，挡住了长江的洪水，可是很多庄稼仍被堤内积水淹没，粮食减产了。洪水给人们带来了灾害，但是在共产党领导下，人们战胜了洪水之后，又展开了生产救灾运动。特别是农业生产合作社，在防汛和生产救灾当中，更显出了它的优越性。社员们积极生产，挽回了积水造成的损失。请看看社员黄传启一家春节前的情景吧：
    在黄传启的家里，看不到灾后的景象。屋檐下挂着一串串的腌好晒起的鸡、鱼和猪肉，他家喂的两只小猪正睡在草堆下，还有几只鸡子在走动着找食吃。黄传启的四个孩子都在门前阳光下快乐地玩耍，一个中年妇女正用石臼在舂米——她是黄传启的妻子。
    黄传启在门前一条长凳上坐下后，指着挂起的鱼肉来回答我的问题：“春节什么都已准备好啦，除了鱼、肉、鸡以外，前两天还买了四斤红糖、柿饼和红枣，这几天还要忙着做点糍粑和豆丝。一家大小在今年春节也做了新的内衣和罩褂。”我问他：政府对他们是不是也进行了救济和扶持。他说“政府发了很多救济款和贷款，救济困难户，但因为我们社里自己克服了困难，把这些救济款全让给最困难的人家了”。
    原来，群力农业生产合作社受灾也是很重的，社员们虽然大力进行了排水、抢收，挽救了大部水田，但旱地却全部淹光。他们响应了政府号召，把深水田改种了二十亩芋头和藕；水退后，除了抢种晚秋外，在旱地里又种了十亩蔬菜，并进行了喂猪、捕鱼、做临时工等副业生产。这样社员们收入就没有减少。黄传启一九五三年单干时，虽是丰收年，也只收入六千斤谷子，今年农、副业收入折合起来，他已经分到七千多斤谷子。因此他家今年过春节，不但年货办齐，吃粮足够，而且在信用合作社还有五十万元的存款。
    “不是共产党领导人民战胜了洪水，不是党领导我们办农业生产合作社，今年怎能这么如意地过春节呢！”这是黄传启在谈话中重复过几次的充满了感激的话。
