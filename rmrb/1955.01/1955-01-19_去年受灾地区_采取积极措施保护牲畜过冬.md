In the disaster-stricken areas last year, active measures are being taken to protect livestock safely through the winter. In order to uniformly allocate fodder and stabilize grass prices, Jiangsu Province has adopted unified purchase and sales measures for fodder. The government is vigorously supplying cattle feed to the disaster areas. For disaster victims who cannot afford to buy grass, the government provides loans to solve the problem. The Jiangsu Branch of the People's Bank of China has now allocated 80 billion yuan for this loan. Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, purchased 900,000 catties of wheat bran, rice bran, and cottonseed cake, and 16 million catties of rice straw from non-disaster areas, which can feed 17,000 head of cattle for two months. In addition to instructing cooperative departments to quickly supply fodder to the disaster areas, the Hunan Provincial People's Government also instructed various localities to further educate the masses on doing a good job in the maintenance of draft animals. Hubei and Anhui provinces mainly mobilized the masses to widely find grass sources or substitute feed, such as wormwood, leaves, rice bran, bean cake, and sweet potato vines, to raise their own livestock. If there are indeed difficulties in raising their own livestock, the government will help solve the problem. Some places have mobilized the masses to find relatives and friends to raise livestock for them. If there are no relatives and friends to turn to, the government will reach agreements with non-disaster areas in advance and organize collective transfers.

While solving the problem of fodder, various localities have also paid attention to the treatment of livestock diseases. Xuchang Prefecture, Henan Province, organized more than 40 Chinese and Western veterinarians from Yancheng, Changge and other counties to go to Shangshui County for medical treatment. Xiangcheng, Dancheng, Yongcheng and other counties organized a total of more than 300 Chinese and Western veterinarians to go deep into the disaster areas for rescue. Huaiyang, Xiangcheng, Shangshui and other counties also held veterinary symposiums to study simple, easy-to-implement, and effective treatment methods. (Liang Cong)

    去年受灾地区
    采取积极措施保护牲畜过冬
    目前各地受灾地区正采取积极措施，保护牲畜安全过冬。江苏省为统一调剂饲草，稳定草价，采取了饲草统购统销措施，政府大力供应灾区牛草，对无钱买草的灾民则由政府贷款解决。现在中国人民银行江苏省分行已拨下此项贷款八百亿元。江西省南昌县从非灾区购得麦麸、谷糠、棉枯各九十万斤，稻草一千六百万斤，可供一万七千头耕牛两个月食用。湖南省人民政府除责成合作部门迅速向灾区供应饲草外，并指示各地进一步向群众进行做好耕畜保养工作的宣传教育工作。湖北、安徽两省主要是发动群众广泛寻找草源或代饲料，如蒿草、树叶、谷糠、豆饼、苕藤等，自养牲畜，自养确有困难的，政府帮助解决。有的地方发动群众自找亲友寄养牲畜，没有亲友可找的，由政府事先和非灾区取得协议，组织起来集体转移。
    在解决饲草同时，各地也注意了对牲畜疾病的治疗。河南省许昌专区组织了郾城、长葛等县的中、西兽医四十多人，前往商水县就医。项城、郸城、永城等县共组织了中、西兽医三百多人，深入灾区进行抢救。淮阳、项城、商水等县并召开了兽医座谈会，研究了简便易行、治疗有效的方法。（梁琮）
