Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 21st (via TASS): The German News Agency reported that the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic, at its meeting on January 20th, discussed the Soviet government's statement on the German question and issued a statement saying: The Council of Ministers welcomes this statement by the Soviet government, as it fully conforms to the opinions and wishes of the government of the German Democratic Republic and the interests of all German people.

The statement emphasized: All-German free elections are of decisive significance for the restoration of German unification and the conclusion of a peace treaty. The Council of Ministers is prepared to hold the repeatedly proposed negotiations at any time to discuss the formulation of an all-German election law. Such negotiations must begin immediately, lest the ratification of the Paris Accords render them meaningless.

The statement said: In order to completely eliminate all obstacles hindering an agreement on the preparation and holding of all-German free elections, the Council of Ministers states very clearly: It agrees with the Soviet government's proposal to establish international supervision over the holding of all-German elections.

The statement announced: Ratification of the Paris Accords would block the path to restoring German unification by peaceful means. If the West German government clings to the Paris Accords and rejects the proposal by the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic to reach an early agreement on the issue of holding all-German free elections, the German Democratic Republic will have to study and prepare to take emergency measures in the spirit of the Moscow Conference resolutions and on the basis of its friendly relations with the Soviet Union. All responsibility for hindering an agreement on the issue of holding all-German free elections and restoring German unification by peaceful means shall be borne by those who ratify the Paris Accords.

    民主德国部长会议欢迎苏联政府关于德国问题的声明
    再次表示准备讨论全德选举恢复统一问题
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十一日讯：德意志通讯社报道，德意志民主共和国部长会议在一月二十日的会议上讨论了苏联政府关于德国问题的声明，并且发表声明说：部长会议欢迎苏联政府这项声明，因为它完全符合德意志民主共和国政府的意见和愿望以及全体德国人民的利益。
    声明强调指出：全德自由选举对恢复德国的统一和缔结和约具有决定性意义。部长会议准备随时举行它一再建议举行的谈判，来讨论制订全德选举法的问题。必须立即开始这种谈判，以免因巴黎协定的批准而使这种谈判失去意义。
    声明说：为了完全消除阻挠就准备和举行全德自由选举问题达成协议的一切障碍，部长会议极明确地声明：它同意苏联政府关于对举行全德选举建立国际监督的建议。
    声明宣布：批准巴黎协定就会堵住用和平方法恢复德国统一的道路。如果西德政府死抱住巴黎协定不放，并且拒绝德意志民主共和国部长会议所提出的关于在举行全德自由选举问题上早日达成协议的建议，德意志民主共和国就不得不本着莫斯科会议的决议的精神，并且在它和苏联的友好关系的基础上，研究和准备采取紧急措施。而阻挠在举行全德自由选举和用和平方法恢复德国统一的问题上达成协议的全部责任，就要由那些批准巴黎协定的人们来负。
