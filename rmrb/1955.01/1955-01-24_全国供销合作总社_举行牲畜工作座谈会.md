To rationally regulate and supply the needs of farmers for draft animals, the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives convened a livestock work symposium from January 5th to 18th, gathering representatives from supply and marketing cooperatives in seventeen provinces.

During the meeting, supply and marketing cooperatives from Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, and fourteen other provinces signed agreements for the exchange of 161,000 head of draft animals. The 20,000 Mongolian horses ordered by the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives from the Mongolian People's Republic this year were also allocated at the meeting. The meeting determined that in the future, in addition to independently managing a portion of draft animals and carrying out adjustments between regions, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions should focus their main efforts on organizing and activating the exchange of draft animals among local farmers. According to investigations, over 90 percent of the draft animals needed for exchange by farmers each year are adjusted through local livestock markets, but most of these transactions are organized by brokers and cattle dealers. Livestock markets lack unified management, which affects the rational supply of draft animals. The meeting believes that to improve the management of livestock markets in the future, it is first necessary to combine this with the work of reforming brokers and cattle dealers, and to establish a large number of livestock exchange service departments in livestock markets to serve livestock exchange. The service departments will be responsible for organizing livestock transactions between farmers in a planned manner; assisting farmers in handling livestock transportation; and providing necessary rooms, yards, fodder, and medical supplies at the market to facilitate livestock trading activities for farmers. In recent years, supply and marketing cooperatives in Henan and Anhui provinces have established more than 400 livestock exchange service departments, which have played a significant role in rationally regulating farmers' needs for draft animals. Last year, supply and marketing cooperatives in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Jiangxi, Anhui, Shanxi, Jiangsu, and other provinces organized the mutual exchange of more than 1.5 million head of livestock among farmers, which is more than four times the number of livestock supplied to farmers by the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives last year.

    全国供销合作总社
    举行牲畜工作座谈会
    中华全国供销合作总社为合理的调剂和供应农民对耕畜的需要，在一月五日到十八日，召集十七个省的供销合作社代表举行牲畜工作座谈会。
    会议期间辽宁、河北、山东等十四个省的供销合作社互相签订了十六万一千头的耕畜交流协议，全国合作总社今年向蒙古人民共和国订购的二万匹蒙马也在会议上进行了分配。会议确定今后各地供销合作社除自营一部分耕畜并在地区之间进行调剂外，要把主要力量用在组织和活跃当地农民之间的耕畜交流。据调查，各地农民每年需要交流的耕畜约有百分之九十以上依靠当地牲畜市场得到调剂，但是大多数是由牙纪、牛行组织成交，牲畜市场缺乏统一管理，以致影响耕畜的合理供应。会议认为今后要做好牲畜市场的管理，首先应当结合改造牙纪、牛行的工作，在牲畜市场上大量举办为牲畜交流服务的牲畜交流服务部。服务部负责有计划地组织农民之间的牲畜成交；帮助农民办理牲畜运输；以及在市场上设备必要的房间、场园、粮草、医疗药品等，以便利农民牲畜交易活动。几年来河南、安徽省的供销合作社已举办了四百多个牲畜交流服务部，对合理地调剂农民对耕畜的需要，起了很大作用。去年内蒙古自治区和江西、安徽、山西、江苏等省的供销合作社，组织农民间相互调剂的牲畜就有一百五十多万头，相当于全国供销合作社去年供应给农民的牲畜四倍多。
