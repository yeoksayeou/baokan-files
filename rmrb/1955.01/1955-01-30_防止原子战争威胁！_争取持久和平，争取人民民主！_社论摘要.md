Xinhua News Agency, January 29th dispatch from Bucharest via Romanian News Agency: The latest issue of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" published an editorial entitled "Prevent the Threat of Atomic War!" The editorial stated that the recent Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council was an event of significant international importance, a new stage in the development of the great movement of peace advocates. This meeting demonstrated the unwavering will of the people of all countries to strive for peace and their determination to prevent the resurgence of German militarism and the threat of atomic war. The historically significant documents adopted at this meeting inspired all peace advocates and all upright people, calling on them to strengthen the struggle for peace and security, to ease international tensions, to oppose the policies of war blocs, and to resist the attack of imperialist forces on human life and civilization.

The editorial pointed out that the worldwide signature campaign against atomic weapons, initiated by the World Peace Council, is unfolding amidst a complex international situation. The people of all countries are now experiencing the most decisive stage in their history. Reactionary groups in some Western countries, such as the United States, are trying their best to intensify international tensions, revive German militarism, and prepare to launch an atomic war.

The editorial said that without a doubt, this movement against atomic weapons will spread to all countries without exception, and this movement will include all upright people throughout the world who are striving to stop atomic war. The people of all countries can and must ban atomic weapons. To achieve this goal, all peace advocates, regardless of nationality, gender, social status, political belief, and religious belief, must contribute all their strength, courage, initiative, and organizational ability to promote this broad, truly mass movement, constantly remain vigilant against the conspiracies of the enemies of peace, and overcome all difficulties with unwavering determination.

The editorial said that the Communist and Workers' Parties believe that the struggle to win a better future for the people is inseparable from the task of safeguarding and strengthening peace. They will use all their strength to ensure that the people of all countries achieve complete victory in the struggle for peace and against the threat of atomic war.
