	Why Pei Qingyuan Changed
	Li Dahuang

	Pei Qingyuan was a middle peasant from Wangcheng Township, Xishui County, Hubei Province. He had a large family and a lot of land, and had always been a substantial farmer. After the autumn harvest the year before last, the township conducted propaganda and education on the general task of the transition period. The socialist awareness of many farmers was raised, and they actively sold surplus grain to support national industrial construction. However, Pei Qingyuan couldn't understand it: if the government buys up the surplus grain, wouldn't it be more convenient to keep it for oneself? Besides, what if grain prices rise next spring? Although he couldn't understand it, seeing that everyone else was selling, he had to sell too. So he reluctantly sold two thousand catties of surplus grain. After selling the grain, he felt depressed: I can't make decisions about what I produce, how annoying! So he asked someone to write a letter and sent it to his third younger brother, who was in the army, to complain about his "suffering." Who knew that his third brother would reply criticizing his thinking as incorrect. The letter said that the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain was entirely for the benefit of the farmers. It also urged him to join agricultural producers' cooperatives, take the new road, and improve production. This letter poured cold water on him. But it also made his thinking take a turn: why did my third brother also criticize my thinking as incorrect?

	At the end of September last year, the township arranged for unified grain purchase. Cadres guided everyone to summarize the benefits of unified grain purchase and sale over the past year. Pei Qingyuan sat with everyone, listening to others speak. When people mentioned unified purchase and sale, they linked it to the government's guarantee of grain supply, which allowed farmers to avoid exploitation by middlemen. Wang Youwang calculated an account for himself: over the past year, he obtained eight hundred catties of rice at a fair and reasonable price; in the past, to solve these food problems, he would have had to seek help from usurers, who would charge five dou of interest per stone borrowed, meaning he would have to pay four stone of interest grain. Pei Qingyuan thought, this is true; the 1954 flood was so severe, but the supply grain was still the same price as in 1953, with no increase! People also talked about how they increased production investment after selling surplus grain in 1953, which improved production and living standards. Lin Youde said that in 1953 he used the money from selling surplus grain to buy forty catties of ammonium sulfate, turning the "Looking-at-Heaven Hill" into a high-yield field; he spent forty-five thousand yuan to buy a piglet, which is now a big pig weighing more than a dan of meat; the cotton wadding that was destroyed by Japanese shells in 1938 was also replaced with new ones after selling surplus grain in 1953. Pei Qingyuan thought, this is also true: he used the money from selling surplus grain to buy fifty catties of ammonium sulfate and some fertilizer cakes for the paddy fields, and also bought "666" to kill cotton insects. Didn't production increase in 1954? Twelve mu of paddy fields yielded more than seven thousand six hundred catties of grain, an increase of more than one thousand three hundred catties compared to 1953, and cotton production was almost doubled compared to 1953. Eating and clothing are much better than in the past. Thinking of this, Pei Qingyuan remembered what his third brother had said in his letter: "The policy of unified purchase and sale of grain is entirely for the benefit of the farmers." Now, from his own experience, this is absolutely true.

	Although Pei Qingyuan understood the benefits of unified grain purchase and sale, when it came time to sell surplus grain, he hesitated again: he had underreported his yield by more than six hundred catties, should he report truthfully now or not? If he doesn't report truthfully, what will he leave it for? Does he still want to engage in "spontaneity"? He hadn't forgotten about engaging in "spontaneity" in 1953. In 1953, when the Mid-Autumn Festival was approaching, a tavern owner from the city ran to him and said, "Go to Luotian to traffic in chestnuts, sell them in Huangshi City, and you can earn at least half!" This hit him right in the heart. He hurriedly sold a cow and went to Luotian to traffic in chestnuts. It took a lot of effort to transport the chestnuts to Huangshi City, but the price wasn't much higher than in Luotian. The state-owned companies and cooperatives had piles of chestnuts like small mountains. Suddenly, he heard a rumor that the price of chestnuts was high in Jiujiang. He simply gathered up some chestnuts from others on the same route and transported them by boat to Jiujiang. Who knew that although Jiujiang was hundreds of miles away from Huangshi City, the price wasn't much higher either. He had to grit his teeth and sell them. After deducting the weighing loss, spoilage, transportation costs, and food, he almost lost the entire cow. He wasn't willing to give up, so he borrowed some money and transported a batch of lime from Huangshi City back home, planning to make a profit and return home. But his wishful thinking was wrong again, and he didn't earn any money from the lime either. He lost a cow and delayed production for more than twenty days. Since suffering this loss, Pei Qingyuan felt a bit "fed up," and only last year did he honestly participate in the mutual aid group to engage in production. Now that production has improved, what will be the result if he goes to engage in "spontaneity" again? Needless to say, it would be as people say: "Economically not worthwhile, reputationally disgraceful." Thinking of this, Pei Qingyuan found the answer to the question of whether or not to report the six hundred catties of yield truthfully.

	After thinking through the problem, Pei Qingyuan happily discussed the issue of selling surplus grain with his family. Everyone agreed with his opinion: to report the hidden six hundred catties of yield. According to the "four retentions" standard, after retaining enough grain for eating and use, all the remaining grain should be sold. Immediately, everyone calculated the result, and more than three thousand catties of surplus grain could be sold.

	The next day, Pei Qingyuan sold more than three thousand catties of surplus grain to the state. People were surprised to hear the news and said: in 1953, everyone knew that Pei Qingyuan's thinking on selling surplus grain was not clear, but in 1954 he sold all the surplus grain at once, he really has become enlightened. Some "unclear households" (mostly well-to-do middle peasants) saw that Pei Qingyuan had sold his grain, and they also dispelled their concerns and actively sold surplus grain. Now Pei Qingyuan has been evaluated by the township as a "model of patriotic surplus grain sales." He was extremely happy, deposited the money from selling surplus grain into the credit cooperative, and reserved it for production investment in 1955.

    裴青源为什么会转变
    李大荒
    裴青源是湖北省浠水县望城乡的一个中农，家口大，田地多，一向是个大庄户。前年秋收后，乡里进行了过渡时期总任务的宣传教育，许多农民的社会主义觉悟提高了，踊跃售出余粮，支援国家工业建设。但是，裴青源却思想不通：政府把余粮买走了，哪有留在自己手里方便？再说，要是明年春上粮食涨价了怎么办呢？尽管想不通，眼见别人都卖了，自己也不能不卖呀。于是勉勉强强地卖了二千斤余粮。卖粮后，心里老是沉闷闷的：自己生产出来的东西，自己不能作主，多气人！他于是托人写了封信，寄给参军的三弟诉诉“苦情”。哪晓得三弟回信批评他的思想不对。信中说统购统销政策点点是为农民好。还要他参加农业生产合作社，走新道路，把生产搞好。这封信给他当头浇了一瓢冷水。但却也使他的思想拐了个弯：为什么三弟也批评我的思想不对？
    去年九月末，乡里布置粮食统购，干部引导大家总结一年来粮食统购统销的好处。裴青源和大家坐在一起，听着别人发言。人们提起统购统销，就联系到政府保证粮食供应，使农民避免了中间剥削的好处。汪友旺给自己算了一笔账：一年来，他以公平合理的价钱，得了八百斤米的供应；如果在过去，要想解决这些口粮问题，就得求助高利贷者，以借一石驮五斗利来算，就要驮四石利谷。裴青源心想，这话是实在的；一九五四年水灾这样严重，买供应粮还是一九五三年的原价，一点没涨哪！人们又谈到一九五三年卖余粮后增加了生产投资，生产提高、生活改善的情况。林幼德说他一九五三年用卖余粮的钱买了硫酸錏四十斤，把“望天丘”变成了丰产田；花四万五千元买了个奶猪儿，现在是一担多肉的大猪了；一九三八年被日本鬼子炮弹打破了的棉絮，也在一九五三年卖余粮后换成了新的。裴青源心想，这话也是实在的：自己把卖余粮的钱买了五十斤硫酸錏和一些肥饼上在稻田里，又买了“六六六”杀了棉虫，一九五四年不是增产了吗？十二亩稻田打了七千六百多斤谷，比一九五三年增产一千三百多斤，棉花比一九五三年差不多要增产一倍。吃的穿的都比过去好多了。裴青源想到这里，记起三弟在信上说过的话：“统购统销政策点点是为农民好。”现在从自己经历过的事情看来，这话一点不假。
    裴青源虽然了解粮食统购统销的好处，但是真到卖余粮的时候，心里又犹豫起来了：自己曾经少报产量六百多斤，现在报实不报实？不报实留下干什么？还想搞“自发”吗？一九五三年搞“自发”的事情，他并没有忘记。一九五三年快到中秋节的时候，谷打上了场，城里头的一个酒馆老板跑来对他说：“去罗田贩板栗，到黄石市卖，起码赚个对半呀！”这一说正中了他的心思。忙把一条牛卖掉，去罗田贩板栗。好费力把板栗运到黄石市，可是价钱并不比罗田高多少，国营公司、合作社里的板栗堆得像小山样。忽听着一阵风，说九江板栗价钱高。索性又把同路的一些板栗拉到手，一船运到九江。哪晓得九江虽然离黄石市几百里路，价钱也高不了多少。只得咬着牙卖了，把蚀秤、烂损、运费、伙食一除，一条牛差不多蚀光了。他还不死心，又借了一笔钱，转到黄石市贩了一批石灰往回运，打算捞个本利回家。可是，如意算盘又打错了，石灰也没赚到钱。丢了一条牛，还耽误了二十多天的生产。自从吃了这个亏，裴青源觉得有点“够受”，去年才老老实实地参加互助组搞生产。现在生产搞好了，如果再去搞“自发”，会落个什么结果呢？不用说，会像人们所说的：“经济上划不来，舆论上不光采。”裴青源想到这里，对于那六百多斤产量要不要报实的问题，也就找到答案了。
    裴青源把问题想通后，心情愉快地和家里人商量售余粮的问题。大家同意他的意见：把隐瞒的六百多斤产量补报出来。根据“四留”的标准，把要吃要用的粮食留足后，余下的粮食全部卖掉。当下大家计算的结果，可以卖出余粮三千多斤。
    第二天，裴青源把三千多斤余粮卖给国家了。人们听到这个消息，惊讶地说：一九五三年，谁不知道裴青源售余粮思想不通，一九五四年一下子就把余粮全部卖出，真是觉悟过来了。有些“不通户”（多半是富裕中农）看到裴青源把粮卖了，自己也打消顾虑，踊跃售余粮。现在裴青源被乡里评为“爱国售余粮模范”。他高兴极了，把售余粮的钱存进信用社，留作一九五五年的生产投资。
