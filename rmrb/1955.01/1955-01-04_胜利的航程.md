    The Voyage of Victory
    By our reporter Gao Changren

    A New Page in the History of Navigation on the Sichuan River

    On the evening of December 17, 1954, decorated archways were erected on the shore of Yichang Port, and colorful lanterns glittered. Four large passenger and cargo ships and a work boat, anchored on the river, puffed out smoke and steam. Strings of colored lights were hung from the masts, and flags of various colors were planted around the ships, fluttering in the river breeze. Dockworkers were busily loading and unloading cargo. People on board and ashore had just finished attending the celebration of the Sichuan River navigation marker reform in the afternoon, and now they were waiting for an exciting moment. This moment arrived at four o'clock in the morning on the 18th. Zhang Ming, Deputy Director of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration, issued an order to open the Sichuan River to night navigation in sections. He ordered the Hangchuan, Huayuan, Minquan, Minxi, and Kuixia ships to set sail immediately. At this moment, firecrackers and applause rang out on the shore, and all the ships on the river sounded their horns, celebrating a new victory in the history of navigation on the Sichuan River. The five ships slowly started amidst cheers, pushing and towing barges, and began their victorious voyage.

    The fleet sailed upstream along the newly installed navigation markers, entering the Xiling Gorge, and then the Sichuan River. This Sichuan River is known for its dangerous shoals and turbulent waters. Not only is the current rapid and the river narrow, but the riverbed is also full of reefs and the channel is winding. Over the years, countless ships have been damaged and countless lives have been lost on the Sichuan River. However, the Sichuan River is also the only transportation artery connecting the southwestern provinces and the inland provinces of China. Grain and local specialties from the southwestern provinces, and industrial construction equipment from the inland supporting the southwest, all have to be transported out of and into the Sichuan River. In recent years, thanks to the efforts of the Sichuan River sailors, the volume of transportation has greatly increased. However, a large number of ships can only sail during the day. Due to the lack of prominent navigation markers in the past, maritime accidents often occurred. According to statistics from 1950 to before the navigation marker reform, there were 266 maritime accidents of all sizes on the Sichuan River. A few ships also used moonlight for night navigation, but this was also very dangerous and subject to many conditions. The natural hazards of the Sichuan River prevented the transportation potential of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River from being further exploited.

    With the development of national economic construction, the transportation tasks of the Sichuan River have become even busier. How to further exploit the transportation potential of the Sichuan River has become an urgent issue. With the help of Soviet experts, the Yangtze River Navigation Administration began blasting reefs in several important waterways at the end of 1952. This project is still underway. Last November, new-style navigation markers were set up in 60 percent of the total length of the Sichuan River, allowing ships to navigate at night in sections, which increased the ship turnover rate by more than 20 percent. The official opening of the Sichuan River to night navigation in sections on December 18 opened a new page in the history of navigation on the Sichuan River. It is also a pioneering work for inland waterway work throughout the country.

    Sentries on the Waterway

    During the voyage, we saw a chain of inland waterway navigation markers. As the ship left the Yichang wharf, we saw a red light on the south bank, and the Huayuan, the ship we were on, proceeded along the red light. Sometimes, triangular buoys with lights appeared beside the ship, flashing past. The crew said, "This indicates that there are obstacles underwater, and ships cannot approach." After a while, the red light disappeared, and a white light appeared on the north bank. The Huayuan turned its bow and approached the north bank. The crew said, "This is called a crossing marker. You have to cross the river to get on the waterway." Our ship proceeded like this, chasing one light after another. At dawn, we happened to be near the famous and dangerous place on the Sichuan River - "Kongling." There are no light markers in this place, and ships must pass through during the day, but we had already gained four hours of night navigation time.

    On the 19th, the ship left the Three Gorges, and it was still thirty or forty miles from Wanxian when it got dark, and the navigation markers in the river all lit up. In one section, red and white lights lined the river surface into a lane, and our ship sailed in the lane, safely arriving at Wanxian. Comrades who were familiar with the Sichuan River channel told me that without navigation markers, we would not have been able to reach Wanxian that night, and we would have had to anchor in Wushan. Because the Sichuan River is so dangerous, even navigating in the dark for an hour or two could cause maritime accidents. If the sailing ship estimates that it will not reach the destination ahead in one or two hours, it has to anchor in place for a day or half a day. This is the reason why the proportion of non-productive berthing time for ships was large in the past. With navigation markers, you can travel early and late, and night navigation for two or three hours can save a day's sailing time. He said, "This is the role of navigation marker reform and sectional night navigation, and this is how the ship turnover rate is increased."

    These are the first new-style navigation markers to appear on the Sichuan River. In order to build these navigation markers, Soviet waterway expert Comrade Klemikov personally went to the Sichuan River four times and gave a lot of help in the design concept and the specific details of manufacturing the navigation markers. In order to set up and maintain these navigation markers, the staff of the navigation marker station overcame many difficulties. At the Laoshudong navigation marker station, there was a shore marker set up in a place called Suishitan (Crushed Stone Beach). Once, the water level in the Sichuan River rose, and wooden boats could not get close to the shore marker to turn the lights on and off. Navigation marker operator Zheng Xinggao ran sixteen miles every day, detouring and climbing to the mountain cliff to turn on the lights. Half a mile of this road was very steep, so he crawled on all fours, and because the light was not easy to carry, he held it in his mouth. He persisted like this for half a month. In another place, for the same reason, he could not work in the normal way. Every morning and evening, Zheng Xinggao had his companions tie a rope around his waist and hang him down from the cliff. Afterwards, when others asked him why he was not afraid of danger, he said, "This cliff is dangerous, but it is not as dangerous as the movie 'Taking Huashan Mountain Intelligently'. If we don't overcome these difficulties, if the ship has an accident, it will cause a great loss to the country." Now, on the thousand-mile Sichuan River line, there are 540 navigation marker station staff working hard in the wind and rain and in the rapids.

    Soviet experts said: "Navigation markers are sentries on the waterway." Indeed, these different types of navigation markers are the traffic police on the Sichuan River. They cannot speak, but they can guide the ships coming and going to a safe sailing direction.

    The Joy of the Sichuan River Sailors

    As the ship left the Three Gorges, it encountered many fleets loaded with grain and local specialties. From a distance, the downstream ships sounded their horns in salute. When the two ships approached, the crew members waved and cheered to each other. The sailors were all delighted with the sectional opening of night navigation this time. From then on, not only was the safety of their navigation guaranteed, but also, each time they went upstream and downstream, they could shorten the sailing time by two days.

    The sailors had long created miracles in the transportation on the Sichuan River. Since 1952, they have promoted the Soviet one-line towing method and the pushing method on the Sichuan River. The number of barges pushed has developed from two or three to a maximum of five to seven. Before liberation, the Kuixia ship could only tow a 100-ton barge. Now, it is still the same ship and the same number of people, but it can push and tow 300 to 700 tons of cargo barges. However, due to the limitation of not being able to navigate at night on the Sichuan River, it still could not meet the transportation requirements of the Sichuan River. Before the navigation marker reform, a lot of goods were piled up on the wharves of Yichang, Wanxian, and Chongqing, waiting to be loaded. After the navigation markers were installed, each ship increased its turnover rate by more than 20 percent, and the transportation on the Sichuan River became even busier.

    The happiest about the navigation marker reform and the sectional opening of night navigation were the drivers and pilots. In the past, in order to become familiar with the Sichuan River channel, they had to spend a long time memorizing the stones, trees, and houses along the river as navigation markers. If these natural markers changed, or if they were slightly negligent, maritime accidents would occur. Yang Wanhua, the third pilot of the Huayuan ship, said with emotion: "Before liberation, ships became blind on the Sichuan River as soon as it got dark. After liberation, sometimes we used moonlight to navigate at night, which was like a blind man having a cane. Now, with night markers, we can navigate at night as if we were walking in the daytime with our eyes open." Now, the secrets of the riverbed have been completely revealed, and young drivers can quickly become familiar with the channel as long as they recognize the navigation markers. In the future, pilots will also have to learn driving techniques and combine driving and piloting.

    At four o'clock in the afternoon on the 21st, our fleet safely arrived in Chongqing. The task of using light markers for sectional night navigation for the first time was successfully completed. That night, these fleets unloaded iron, steel, cement, and other industrial products from Yichang, loaded grain and local specialties, and were about to begin their voyage from Chongqing to Yichang.

    This year, night navigation will be fully opened on the thousand-mile Sichuan River. In 1957, the hidden reefs and dangerous shoals in the river will be cleared away. At that time, let the Sichuan River serve the national transportation cause more obediently, and let thousands of ships travel day and night on the Sichuan River.

    胜利的航程

    川江航运史上新的一页
    一九五四年十二月十七日的晚上，宜昌港岸上扎起了牌楼，彩灯闪耀。江面上停泊着的四艘大型客货轮和一艘工作艇喷吐着煤烟和蒸气，桅杆上吊起了一串串的彩灯，船的四周插满了各色旗帜，在江风中飘扬。搬运工人忙碌地装卸着货物。船上、岸上的人们，下午刚开完了庆祝川江航标改革的大会，现在又在等待一个令人兴奋的时刻。这个时刻在十八日上午四时到来了。长江航运管理局副局长张明发布了分段开放川江夜航的命令，他命令航川、华源、民权、民熙、夔峡五艘轮船立即开航。这时，岸上响起了鞭炮声和掌声，江上的所有轮船都拉响了汽笛，庆祝川江航运史上新的胜利。那五艘轮船在欢呼声中徐徐开动，推顶着拖驳，开始了胜利的航程。
    船队沿着新设的导航标志逆水而上，驶进了西陵峡，便进入川江。这川江素以它的凶滩恶水而著名，不仅水流湍急，江面狭窄，而且江底礁石众多，航道弯曲。多少年来，在川江上不知损坏了多少船只，丧失了多少人命。但是，川江又是我国西南各省和内地各省联系的唯一交通大道，西南各省的粮食和土特产、内地支援西南的工业建设器材，都得从川江运出来和运进去。这几年来，在川江海员们的努力下，运输量大大提高了。可是大批船舶只能白天航行，由于过去没有显著的航标，常常发生海损事故。据一九五○年到航标改革前的统计，川江的大小海损事故发生了二六六起。也有少数船舶利用月光夜航，但也存在很大的危险，受到许多条件的限制。由于川江天险，使长江上游的运输潜力不能进一步发挥。
    随着国家经济建设的发展，川江的运输任务更加繁忙了，如何进一步发挥川江运输潜力已成了迫切的问题。在苏联专家帮助下，长江航运管理局在一九五二年底就开始在几处险要航道上进行炸礁的工程，这个工程目前仍逐步进行。去年十一月份在川江全长百分之六十的地段设置了新式航标，使川江上来往的船舶可以分段夜航，船舶周转率就提高了百分之二十以上。十二月十八日正式分段开放川江夜航就为川江航运史上打开了新的一页。对全国内河航道工作来说，也是一个创举。
    航道上的岗哨
    在航程中，我们看到了锁链式的内河航标。船离宜昌码头，便见南岸一盏红灯，我们乘的华源轮就顺着红灯前进。有时，船旁出现了点了灯的三角浮标，掠船而过。船员说：“这是指示水下有障碍物，船只不能靠近。”走了一段，红灯没有了，原来北岸上又出现了一盏白灯。华源轮便掉转船头，驶近北岸。船员说：“这叫过河标，必须过河才能走上航道。”我们的船就是这样追着一个一个灯光前进。天亮时，恰好驶近川江著名的险要地方——“崆岭”。这地方没有灯标，船只必须在白天通过，可是我们已争取了四小时的夜航时间。
    十九日，船出三峡后离万县还有三、四十里，天就黑下来，江内的航标都亮起来了。在一段地方，红白灯光把江面排成一个巷道，我们的船在巷道中航行，安全抵达万县。熟悉川江航道的同志告诉我，如果没有航标，这天晚上就到不了万县，只好在巫山停泊。因为川江险恶，那怕摸黑航行一两个钟头，也要发生海损事故。如果航行的船只估计有一两个钟头赶不到前面的目的地，就得在原地停泊一天或半天。过去船舶非生产停泊时间比例大，就是这个道理。有了航标，可以起早摸黑赶路，夜航两三个小时，就可争取一天的航行时间。他说：“这就是航标改革和分段夜航的作用，就是这样提高船舶周转率的。”
    这是川江上第一次出现的新式航标。为了建设这些航标，苏联航道专家克勒米克夫同志曾四次亲自到川江，在设计思想和制造航标的具体细节上，都给了不少的帮助。为了设置和维护这些航标，航标站的工作人员曾经克服了许多困难。在老鼠洞航标站，有个叫碎石滩的地方设了一个岸标。有一次，川江水涨，木船不能靠近岸标去点灯收灯。航标员郑兴高每天就跑十六里路绕道爬到山崖上去点灯。其中有半里路非常陡峭，他就用两手两足爬行，灯不好带，他就衔在嘴里。他这样一直坚持了半个月。在另一地方，由于同样原因不能用正常方法去工作，每天早上和晚上，郑兴高让同伴们用绳子系住他的腰，从悬崖上吊下去。事后，别人问他为什么不怕危险，他说：“这山崖再险，也没有‘智取华山’电影上那么险。我们不克服这些困难，如果轮船出了事，那要给国家造成多大的损失。”现在，千里川江线上，有五百四十名航标站员不避风雨，在急流中艰苦地工作着。
    苏联专家说：“航标是航道上的岗哨。”的确，这些不同类型的航标，就是川江上的交通警察，它们不会说话，可是能给来往船舶指引出安全航行的方向。
    川江海员的欢乐
    船出三峡，遇到很多装满了粮食和土特产的船队。在老远的地方，下水船就拉响了致敬的汽笛。两船靠近时，船员们互相招手、欢呼。海员们都为这次分段开放夜航而喜悦。从此，他们不仅航行的安全有了保障，而且，每一次上下水都可缩短两天的航行时间。
    海员们在川江运输上早就创造了奇迹。从一九五二年开始，他们在川江上就推行苏联一列式拖带法和顶推法，顶推的驳船，由两艘、三艘最多发展到顶推五艘到七艘。夔峡轮在解放前只能拖带一百吨的驳船，现在，还是那条船，那么多的人，却能推顶三百吨到七百吨的货驳。就是这样，由于川江不能夜航的限制，还满足不了川江运输的要求，在航标改革前，宜昌、万县、重庆的码头上，堆积了很多货物，等待装运。有了航标以后，每艘船提高百分之二十以上的周转率，川江运输就更加繁忙了。
    对航标改革和分段开放夜航最高兴的是驾驶员和引水人员。他们过去为了熟悉川江航道，要用很长的时间死记住沿江的石头、树木、房屋当作航行标志。这些自然标志一有变动，或者他们稍一疏忽，就要发生海损事故。华源轮三引水杨万华感慨地说：“解放前，天一黑轮船在川江上便成了瞎子，解放后有时利用月夜航行，等于瞎子有了一个拐杖，现在，有了夜标，我们夜航就像睁开眼睛在白天走路一样。”现在，江底的秘密被全部揭露出来，青年的驾驶员只要认清了航标，便可很快熟悉了航道。以后，引水人员也要学习驾驶技术，把驾引合一起来。
    二十一日下午四时，我们的船队安全抵达重庆。首次利用灯标分段夜航的任务胜利完成了。当晚这些船队卸下从宜昌运来的铁、钢、水泥和其他工业品，装上粮食和土特产，又要开始从重庆到宜昌的航行。
    今年，在千里川江上，将要全部开放夜航。一九五七年江里的暗礁和险滩将扫除干净。那时，让川江更驯服地为国家运输事业服务，让千百艘轮船日夜不停地行驶在川江上。
