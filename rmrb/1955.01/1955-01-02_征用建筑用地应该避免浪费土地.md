    Requisitioning Land for Construction Should Avoid Wasting Land
    To the Editor:
    In recent years, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has approved many units to requisition land for construction in Beijing (mainly in the suburbs). The peasant masses recognize this as a need for national construction and have adopted a positive attitude of support and assistance. However, some units have not made good use of the requisitioned land, resulting in serious waste, which has aroused dissatisfaction among the peasant masses. Some farmers said, "It's outrageous that they don't plan things well, requisition the land but don't start construction, letting it go to waste!"
    Recently, the Beijing Municipal Real Estate Administration, together with the people's governments of various districts, conducted a general inspection on this issue. They found that in the past, there were 136 cases of wasting land due to approving more land than needed, approving land too early before use, and approving land without using it at all. The total amount of wasted land was more than 9,300 mu, and the compensation paid to farmers for these lands totaled more than 10 billion yuan, resulting in an estimated loss of more than 1.5 billion yuan to agricultural production. Of these unused lands, more than 6,900 mu have now been returned to farmers for cultivation; among the more than 2,400 mu of land not returned to farmers, some are low-lying alkaline land unsuitable for cultivation, while other parts of the land are stockpiled with building materials or are being prepared for use.
    Why does this waste of land occur? The main reason is the poor planning of the land-using units. For example, the Beijing Foreign Trade College requisitioned land in Dazhongsi, Haidian District, in 1951, but it has remained unused because the school's construction plan was canceled; the Material Supply Company of the Beijing Construction Engineering Bureau requisitioned land in Malian Road, Fengtai in 1953 to build warehouses, and the Beijing Municipal People's Government Cadre School requisitioned land in Baishiqiao, Haidian in 1952 to build houses, but they have not been used due to insufficient construction forces. A total of more than 8,000 mu of land has been left uncultivated due to the above situations. In addition, changes in urban construction planning, and the failure of the Real Estate Administration and the people's governments of various districts to effectively implement the principle of saving land when reviewing certain land-use plans, are also reasons for the waste of land.
    In order to prevent land from being wasted, the Beijing Municipal Real Estate Administration, the Construction Affairs Administration, and the people's governments of various districts have put forward the following opinions after research: All land that is determined to be used should be used within a time limit, otherwise it will be recovered according to the land requisition method and allocated to other units for use; for land that is determined to be used but is constructed in stages, if it can be temporarily returned to farmers for one season of cultivation, it should also be returned to farmers for cultivation. It also requires all units to plan carefully when requisitioning land, and relevant units should strictly review when approving land use, to implement the principle of saving land.
    I believe that this approach by the Beijing Municipal Real Estate Administration is correct. At present, many cities across the country are carrying out basic construction work, and this lesson should be learned to prevent similar waste of land. It is suggested that the people's governments of relevant regions pay attention to this issue as soon as possible.

### 征用建筑用地应该避免浪费土地

    征用建筑用地应该避免浪费土地编辑同志：
    近几年来，北京市人民政府曾批准很多单位在北京市内（主要在郊区）征用土地进行建筑。农民群众认识到这是国家建设的需要，都采取了积极支持和尽力协助的态度。但是，也有一些单位对征用的土地没有很好利用，造成了严重的浪费现象，引起了农民群众的不满。有的农民说：“办事不计划好，征了地不动工，让它白白荒芜，真不像话啊！”
    最近，北京市人民政府房地产管理局会同各区人民政府对这个问题进行了一次普遍的检查，发现过去批准征用土地时批多用少、批早用晚和批而不用等浪费土地的事件共一百三十六起，浪费土地总数共九千三百多亩，征用这些土地而付给农民的补偿费共一百多亿元，使农业生产受到的损失总值估计在十五亿元以上。这些未用的土地中，现在有六千九百多亩已经交给农民耕种；未交给农民使用的二千四百多亩土地中，有一部分是洼碱而不宜耕种的，另一部分土地堆存了建筑材料或准备使用。
    为什么会出现这种浪费土地的情况呢？主要原因是用地单位计划性差，如北京对外贸易专科学校一九五一年征用了海淀区大钟寺的土地，因为建校计划撤销就一直没有用；北京市建筑工程局器材供应公司一九五三年在丰台马连道征用了土地准备修仓库，北京市人民政府干部学校一九五二年在海淀百万庄征用了土地准备盖房子，都因为施工力量不足而没有使用。因上述情况荒芜的土地共八千多亩。此外，城市建设规划的变动，房地产管理局和各区人民政府在审核某些用地计划时没有很好贯彻节约用地的原则，也是造成土地浪费的原因。
    为使土地不致浪费，北京市房地产管理局、建筑事务管理局和各区人民政府研究后，提出如下意见：凡是确定要使用的土地应限期使用，否则就根据征用土地的办法收回，另拨给其它单位使用；凡确定使用而分段施工的土地，如能暂交农民耕种一季的，也应该交农民耕种。并要求各单位在征用土地时妥善计划，有关单位在批准用地时要严加审核，以贯彻节约用地的原则。
    我认为，北京市房地产管理局这种做法是正确的。目前全国很多城市都在进行基本建设工作，应当吸取这个教训，防止类似的浪费土地的现象发生，建议有关地区的人民政府能及早注意这个问题。
