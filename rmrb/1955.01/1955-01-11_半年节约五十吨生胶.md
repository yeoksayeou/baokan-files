Saving Fifty Tons of Raw Rubber in Half a Year
Di Yongkui, Deputy Director of the State-Owned No. 1 Rubber Factory

The State-Owned No. 1 Rubber Factory produces a tire suitable for the ZIS-150 model car. In the past, the tire shoulder was 27 millimeters thick, consuming a lot of raw materials and costing more. Because it was too thick, the high heat generated inside the tire during driving was not easily dissipated, and the tire was easily damaged. Last year, with the advice and concrete assistance of Soviet experts, we rationally improved the tire structure and reduced the shoulder thickness to 23 millimeters. In this way, each tire uses about three kilograms less of raw rubber, and the service life of the product is also extended.

The tire cord fabric used to manufacture tires used to have two kilograms of edge loss per piece (150 yards long and 50 inches wide). Last year, we improved the operation method of applying glue to the cord fabric, reducing problems such as heavy edges and wrinkles. The edge loss per piece is only one kilogram. We also use a rubber washing machine to process those waste cord fabrics, remove the cotton fibers in the middle, and recover 60% of the mixed rubber.

In terms of product formula design, some parts of some products are replaced with reclaimed rubber instead of raw rubber, while ensuring quality.

As a result of these measures, we saved 50 tons of raw rubber for the country in half a year while improving product quality.

Based on the work done last year, we are also preparing to further save raw rubber in the following aspects:

In terms of product design and formula, we will, through experiments and research, under the condition of ensuring quality, rationally replace the tire flap rubber, the filling rubber of the tire bead part of the tire, and the inner and outer diameter rubber of rubber tube products with reclaimed rubber. A preliminary estimate shows that this measure can save 50 tons of raw rubber a year.

In terms of overcoming waste in the process, we will summarize and promote the advanced experience of the Bai Guozhong group. According to the 1954 national quota, each piece of cord fabric requires 138 kilograms of raw rubber. Some groups in our factory use between 138 kilograms and 140 kilograms, while the Bai Guozhong group uses a maximum of only 137 kilograms. The stipulated edge fabric loss of raw rubber for each piece of glued cord fabric is 800 grams (500 grams per jin). The loss of some of our groups is often between 800 grams and 840 grams, while the Bai Guozhong group only loses about 600 grams. If we improve the technical level of other groups to the level of the Bai Guozhong group, we can save 900 million yuan worth of raw rubber a year.

The water bag used in the last process of tire production—vulcanization—accounts for a relatively large proportion of the tire cost. Generally, a water bag can only vulcanize 140 times. However, some high-quality ones can vulcanize 150 to 160 times. If we improve the quality of water bags generally, we can save thousands of kilograms of raw rubber a year.

Of course, we also estimate that saving raw rubber under the condition of improving product quality will require some effort. However, based on past experience, as long as we organize the existing technical force well and mobilize the workers to discuss and come up with solutions, the difficulties can be overcome.

    半年节约五十吨生胶
    国营第一橡胶厂副厂长　邸永魁国营第一橡胶厂生产的一种适合于吉斯一五○型汽车用的外胎，过去胎肩部分有二十七公厘厚，消耗的原材料多，成本也高，并且因为太厚，汽车行驶时车胎内发出来的高热不容易消散，轮胎很容易坏。去年，在苏联专家的建议和具体帮助下，我们合理地改进外胎的构造，把胎肩厚度减到二十三公厘。这样，每条外胎可少用三公斤左右的生胶，还延长了产品的使用时间。
    制造外胎用的帘子布，过去每匹（长一五○码、宽五○吋）要有两公斤的边部损耗。去年，我们改进了帘子布挂胶的操作方法，减少了重边、打皱等毛病，每匹的边部损耗只有一公斤。我们还用洗胶机来处理那些废帘子布，除去当中的棉纤维，又可以收回百分之六十的混练胶。
    在产品配方设计方面，把部分产品的一些部件，在保证质量的条件下，以再生胶来代替生胶。
    由于采取了这些措施，我们在提高产品质量的基础上，在半年内为国家节约了五十吨生胶。
    在去年工作的基础上，我们还准备从下面几个方面进一步节约生胶。
    在产品设计和配方方面，将通过试验、研究等步骤，在保证质量的条件下，把轮胎的垫带胶、外胎胎圈部分的填充胶和胶管类产品的内外径胶，都合理地用再生胶来代替生胶。初步估计了一下，这项措施一年可以节约五十吨生胶。
    在克服工艺过程的浪费方面，我们将总结并推广白国忠小组的先进经验。按照一九五四年国家定额，每匹帘子布需要生胶一百三十八公斤，我们工厂有些小组用一百三十八公斤到一百四十公斤之间，而白国忠小组最高只用一百三十七公斤。挂完胶的帘子布，每匹规定边布损耗生胶八百克（每五百克为一市斤），我们的一些小组的损耗数经常在八百克到八百四十克之间，而白国忠小组则只损耗六百克左右。如果我们把别的小组都提高到白国忠小组的技术水平，一年就可以节约价值九亿元的生胶。
    轮胎生产的最后过程——硫化时所使用的水袋，占轮胎成本的比重相当大。一般的情况是：一个水袋只能硫化一百四十次。但有些质量好的可以硫化一百五十次到一百六十次。如果我们把水袋的质量普遍提高，一年就可以节约数千斤生胶。
    当然，我们也估计到在提高产品质量的条件下，节约生胶是要经过一番努力的。但是，根据已往的经验，只要很好地组织现有的技术力量，发动职工群众讨论和想办法，困难是可以克服的。
