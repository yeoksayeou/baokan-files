Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th. The "Pravda" published on the 9th a statement signed by ten prominent figures in Polish cultural circles, including Dumbowski, Infield, Kruczkowski, and Ivashkevich, calling on scientists and public leaders in Western Europe and the Americas to demand a ban on the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

    The statement said that since the American atomic bomb exploded in Hiroshima ten years ago, killing tens of thousands of innocent residents, American war instigators have launched an atomic arms race. Violating the common will of the people of all countries, they stubbornly refuse to stop the production of such weapons and refuse to provide the guarantee demanded by the countries of the peace camp that such weapons will not be used. According to the wishes of the American military, the rearmed West German army will possess this weapon of mass destruction, and this fact aggravates the danger of nuclear war.
    The statement said: At present, mankind is at a crossroads. On the one hand, we are faced with the path of peaceful cooperation between countries with different social systems and the application of atomic energy for peaceful purposes; on the other hand, mankind is faced with the threat of atomic war. We would like to appeal to people in cultural and scientific circles in Western countries, please, for the sake of the achievements of human civilization and the lives of people of all countries, stop the hands of those atomic war mongers and demand a ban on the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

    波兰文化界著名人士向西方国家公众代表发出呼吁
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”九日刊载了波兰文化界著名人士邓博夫斯基、英费尔德、克鲁奇科夫斯基和伊瓦希凯维奇等十人署名发表的声明，号召西欧和美洲的科学家和公众领袖要求禁止使用原子武器和氢武器。
    声明说，自从十年前美国原子弹在广岛爆炸，杀害了成万的无辜居民以后，美国战争挑拨者就展开了原子军备竞赛。他们违背各国人民共同的意志，顽固拒绝停止这种武器的生产，拒绝提出和平阵营各国所要求的不使用这种武器的保证。按照美国军人的意旨，正在被重新武装起来的西德国防军将拥有这种具有大规模毁灭性的武器，这件事实使核子战争的危险加重了。
    声明说：目前，人类正处在十字路口。一方面，我们面对着一切不同社会制度的国家和平合作，把原子能应用在和平目的的道路；另一方面，人类又面对着原子战争的威胁。我们谨向西方各国文化界和科学界人士发出呼吁，请你们为了人类文明的成就，为了各国人民的生命，制止那些原子战争叫嚣者的手，要求禁止使用原子武器和氢武器。
