    Two Criticisms, One Self-Reflection
    He Lin
    To criticize Hu Shi's bourgeois idealist thought, we should first have the following understandings:
    I. What Hu Shi disseminated was the reactionary bourgeois idealist thought of Western imperialism, especially the reactionary pragmatism or experimentalism of James and Dewey in the United States. Therefore, eliminating the influence of Hu Shi's thought in Chinese academic circles has great significance in deeply opposing the reactionary idealist thought that serves modern imperialist countries.
    II. Hu Shi's reactionary thought is a prominent reflection of the semi-feudal and semi-colonial society of old China, and it is a representative and typical ideology. Now, with the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution, China's feudal system and semi-colonial status are gone forever. However, changes in consciousness often lag behind changes in the economic system, and the bourgeois idealist thought of the semi-feudal and semi-colonial period still has many remnants, and even remains unchanged. Therefore, criticizing Hu Shi's bourgeois idealist thought is to destroy an important stronghold in the superstructure of the old semi-feudal and semi-colonial China, and to pave the way for the superstructure, proletarian thought, academia, and culture of the new China transitioning to a socialist society.
    III. Hu Shi's bourgeois idealist thought is not an isolated and unique thought of him alone, or only of his few disciples such as Mr. Yu Pingbo, but a widespread phenomenon. Intellectuals in the old academic circles of old China were directly or indirectly influenced by him to some extent in one form or another. Even before liberation, those who claimed to disagree with Hu Shi's thought, opposed him, or ignored Hu Shi's thought were inevitably influenced by him or had remnants of bourgeois idealist thought similar to Hu Shi's. It is a very meaningful work for each person to reflect on himself, to use the criticism of Hu Shi's reactionary thought to eliminate his own bourgeois idealist thought in terms of viewpoints and methods, and to improve his own ideological level of Marxism-Leninism.
    Hu Shi's reactionary bourgeois idealist thought has been exposed and criticized quite a bit in newspapers, magazines, and various academic and literary symposiums recently. I now intend to expose and criticize two points in Hu Shi's thought that he himself considered very得意 (satisfactory), that he published in both Chinese and English at the same time, and that he repeatedly promoted verbally.
    I. Opposing the study of "isms" to further oppose the study of philosophy is a new trick to resist Marxist philosophy.
    Everyone knows that Hu Shi's advocacy of "study more problems, talk less about isms" was aimed at Comrade Li Dazhao's articles introducing Marxism at that time. The purpose was to oppose talking about communism, advocate talking more about trivial problems, and use reformism to replace revolution. He also played another more concealed new trick, that is, to further oppose Marxist philosophy by opposing philosophical research or fundamentally denying philosophy. This, however, has rarely been noticed and must be exposed.
    After the September 18th Incident, he vigorously advocated the argument that "philosophy should close its doors" and "philosophers have no food to eat." At that time, he gave an English speech at Peking Union Medical College (the manuscript was published in the English newspapers in Beijing at the time), and he made the absurd argument that "philosophy is bad science." Starting from Comte's reactionary positivism, he believed that empirical science had replaced philosophy, that philosophy had no field of research, and cited the disintegration of the Hegelian school as an example of the "fall of the tree and the scattering of the monkeys" in philosophy, and that philosophy should close its doors. He completely ignored the great historical significance of the emergence of dialectical materialism, which opened a new era for philosophy. Whenever he met someone who specialized in philosophy, he repeatedly asked him: "Why don't you change your profession sooner?" In his "History of Chinese Philosophy" class at Peking University at that time, he routinely repeated his absurd argument that "philosophy should close its doors" every year. He even planned to abolish the Department of Philosophy at Peking University, wanting to transfer individual professors who followed him in doing textual research on the history of philosophy to the Department of History, and forcing other philosophy teachers to "change their profession" or "have no food to eat." Although the Department of Philosophy at Peking University was not abolished by him, Mr. Ji Wenfu, who taught "Left-Wing Wang Yangming Thought" from a new perspective and was quite popular with students, was forced to leave Peking University.
    How could Hu Shi, who promoted experimentalist philosophy and claimed that "philosophy has become my profession, and literature has become my entertainment," suddenly make arguments that fundamentally opposed philosophy during this period? Judging from the specific situation of the Chinese ideological circles at that time, it is not surprising at all.
    This first shows that his own experimentalist philosophy was no longer fashionable and could not be used as a guise for appeals. At that time, the most widely circulated among young people were books introducing Marxist philosophy, while in the colleges, there were other factions of bourgeois idealist goods that were imported from Germany, Britain and the United States, more specialized, more cumbersome, and "profoundly simple" in order to lure young people into the trap of idealism and serve the reactionary ruling class at that time. In other words, after the September 18th Incident, Dewey's philosophy gradually lost its effectiveness in leading the youth masses by the nose. Therefore, his prediction that philosophy would close its doors had the dual effect of opposing academic philosophy and Marxism, which was liked by young people. His opposition to academic philosophy was the opposition of idealism to idealism, and it was a factional dispute within bourgeois reactionary philosophy, which we will not deal with here. But his main target was Marxist philosophy, and he consistently wanted to "liberate" those he called "slaves of Marx" and oppose what he called "neo-classicism," which is very clear. Because he had long lamented: "The slaves of Confucius and Zhu Xi have decreased, but a group of slaves of Marx and Kropotkin have been added; the stale classicism has been overthrown, but it has been replaced by various shallow neo-classicisms." (Hu Shi's Collected Works, Second Series, Volume 3, p. 101). This fully shows that his opposition to philosophy after the September 18th Incident and his opposition to talking about isms after the May Fourth Movement had the same purpose, only the tricks were new.
    In addition, from the perspective of ideological sources, Hu Shi's opposition to philosophy and recognition of philosophy as bad science is inseparable from the agnosticism of positivism, which he tried his best to peddle in China. According to Hu Shi, only the "scientific" knowledge that he understood was knowledge that had sufficient evidence and could be believed. All philosophical knowledge was either bad scientific knowledge or exceeded empirical positivism, belonging to the realm of the unknowable (doubtful). This shows that his opposition to philosophy stemmed from the positivist viewpoint of the bourgeois subjective idealist school. He mistakenly believed that the development of various empirical sciences gradually differentiated from philosophy and became independent, and that philosophy's territory seemed to be shrinking, so he arrogantly and boldly announced that "philosophy should close its doors" and "philosophers have no food to eat." He did not know that the more science develops, the more it enriches philosophy, making the materials that philosophy can summarize and generalize more and more, and that "the method that runs through all natural sciences and social sciences"—Marxist philosophy—can play its role even more. Therefore, as Zhdanov said, "This process of natural sciences and social sciences being liberated from the shackles of philosophical power is a process of progress both for natural sciences and social sciences, and for philosophy itself." (Zhdanov's speech at the discussion meeting on Alexanderov's book "History of Western Philosophy")
    His open opposition to philosophy and one-sided, isolated empty talk about science not only stemmed from the agnosticism of positivists, but also passed on the mantle of his teacher Dewey. Dewey believed that "all debates between rationalists and empiricists, all debates between idealists and materialists, all epistemology since Kant... are non-problematic debates and can be 'left unresolved.'" ("Experimentalism"). Dewey had an important proposition, declaring that "only study human problems, not the problems of philosophers" (this was first appeared in Dewey's "Creative Intelligence," and was later revealed by the editor of "Selected Works of Dewey's Philosophy" as a preface). In terms of cognitive issues, Dewey only recognizes the methods, techniques of how to learn, how to think, how to increase knowledge in various departments is a human problem, and belittled the fundamental problem of epistemology like the knowability of the world as a "philosopher’s problem," wanting to "leave unresolved." He separated human problems from the problems of philosophers, as if human problems do not need to be deeply generalized and philosophically explored. And what Dewey called human problems are essentially not the problems of the people or the workers, but only the problems of the capitalists and the exploiting classes.
    Opposing philosophy, thereby fundamentally opposing Marxist philosophy, is not only the proposition of the Dewey faction. For example, when Russell believes that we can only know parts, not the whole, and that "knowing a thing does not logically include knowledge of its many relationships," when he says, "We have to examine the world piecemeal. We cannot know the nature of those parts of the universe that are farther from our experience.... Although this result is somewhat disappointing, it is in line with the inductive and scientific temperament of our time," (the above quotations are all from Russell's "Problems of Philosophy" in the chapter on the limits of philosophical knowledge), he not only expressed reactionary subjective idealism, but also expressed idealistic agnosticism, and he also expressed the same argument against philosophy as Hu Shi. He teaches people to "examine the world piecemeal," and his so-called "inductive and scientific temperament," like Hu Shi's so-called "bit by bit" textual research method, has the actual political significance of opposing Marxist philosophy and opposing the use of dialectics to examine the universe and life.
    In addition, Russell's direct line, the various logical positivists that are particularly popular in the United States today, mostly criticize the study of fundamental philosophical problems such as materialism and idealism as "metaphysics" that exceed the scope of empirical positivism. They believe that philosophy is only the expression of personal temperament and cannot give people knowledge and truth. They fundamentally deny that dialectics is a method, and regard Marxist materialism as "metaphysics." They also believe that only "physical language" is a "scientific unified language," and all philosophical propositions that they believe cannot be translated into "physical language" are called meaningless propositions. This reactionary philosophical school, which reflects the decline of imperialism, and Hu Shi's absurd statement that opposes philosophy and recognizes philosophy as bad science, are both taking the path of bourgeois subjective idealism.
    So no matter how many differences they have in other aspects, we can put Hu Shi, Dewey, Russell, and logical positivists such as Carnap together as representatives of bourgeois idealism serving imperialism in the modern world trend. Their common points are as follows: 1. They are all idealists—subjective idealists. Their common main ideological source is the reactionary Machism that Lenin once tried hard to destructively attack. They believe that only experience and things within experience can be known, and that matter or objective reality that is independent of experience and consciousness is unknowable and cannot be "empirically verified." 2. They all oppose dialectics. Dewey uses his so-called "experimental logic," Russell and logical positivists use their so-called formal, fragmented "logical analysis" and "semantic analysis" or "nominal analysis," and Hu Shi uses his so-called "bold hypothesis, careful verification" textual research method to replace the truly scientific method and to oppose dialectics. They all metaphysically separate science and philosophy, oppose philosophy and one-sidedly promote science, oppose looking at things from a comprehensive perspective, from relationships, especially from internal connections, and presumptuously believe that individual things can be separated from the whole, separated from relationships, and examined in isolation and in fragments. 3. They all oppose understanding things from a comprehensive perspective, from connections. They oppose talking about revolutionary isms, oppose establishing a rational philosophical world outlook and outlook on life, and therefore, politically, they are all individual democrats who advocate letting go of subjective temperament, hobbies, and opinions, reactionary liberals and reformists.
    Opposing philosophy—in fact, fundamentally opposing Marxist philosophy—is not only a major trend of bourgeois idealism in the era of the decline of Anglo-American imperialism, but also, in the semi-feudal and semi-colonial old China, there were quite a few representatives besides Hu Shi. For example, Mr. Liang Shuming's thought seems to be opposed to Hu Shi in many places, but he only focuses on the study of Chinese cultural, social, and political issues, and only talks about "the Confucian attitude towards life" or "the direction of Chinese culture," but avoids talking about isms, which is the same as Hu Shi. For a long time after liberation, he still did not admit that his own views belonged to the category of idealism. The book "The Essentials of Chinese Culture," which was published after liberation and aimed to describe his "views on Chinese history and culture," also clearly shows that he, like Hu Shi, had the idea of opposing philosophy—basically opposing Marxist philosophy. In the preface to this book, he said: "I never thought of 'social development history' or 'cultural philosophy' at the beginning, and I had no intention of playing with this set." When he talks about Chinese problems, on the one hand, he starts from his own subjective "intuition," and on the other hand, he extracts many fragmented facts and quotes many words from others who are of the same mind as him to verify his intuitive views. He uses the slogans of opposing "academic-style research" and opposing "empty nouns and false concepts" to oppose the study of "social development history" and "cultural philosophy." His unwillingness to play with the "social development history" is an important part of fundamentally opposing Marxist philosophy—historical materialism.
    Of course, Mr. Liang Shuming's opposition to philosophy and Hu Shi's opposition to philosophy have different bases and starting points. Hu Shi believes that philosophy is bad science, and he has to oppose philosophy in order to promote "science." Mr. Liang Shuming starts from emphasizing intuition (in the book "The Essentials of Chinese Culture," he no longer uses the term "intuition," but replaces it with "rationality" with his unique meaning. What he calls "rationality" is basically what he calls "intuition" in the book "Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophy.") and opposing intellect. Therefore, he said that "what I am committed to is not only between seeing, hearing, thinking and discriminating; outside of seeing, hearing, thinking and discriminating, there are great things. This is also different from ordinary philosophers." Because he emphasizes intuition "outside of seeing, hearing, thinking and discriminating," he opposes philosophy that emphasizes seeing, hearing, thinking and discriminating and emphasizes intellect. In fact, he is in favor of the mystical school of intuitionism. Therefore, he also said: "Science comes from intellect; what comes from rationality (intuition) does not belong to science. Most of this (referring to rationality) is just thought (including philosophy and isms), not knowledge." This means that most of what is in rationality is just "thought" (thought here should also be interpreted as intuition), and philosophical and political isms also belong to the "rationality" (intuition) aspect, not intellect, nor knowledge. According to them, philosophy and political isms, moral judgments, are only expressions of sentiment, not knowledge, and have nothing to do with science, which is exactly the same as the views of the reactionary logical positivists such as Carnap, which are currently popular in the United States. The idealist essence and reactionary essence of this school have been mentioned above. Its purpose is to make their political propositions and religious moral beliefs neither subject to the laws of science nor guided by a rational philosophical world outlook and outlook on life, but purely built on their subjective arbitrary intuition, opinions, feelings, willfulness, hobbies, and prejudices. This fully demonstrates that it is bourgeois subjective idealism.
    Mr. Liang Shuming also said: "The reason why China has no science in later generations is that it had no philosophy in ancient times. Philosophy is only a Western possession, just as science is only possessed by the West." (The Essentials of Chinese Culture, p. 308). In this way, he handed over both science and philosophy to Westerners, and he could not see any traces of science and philosophy in Chinese cultural heritage at all. When he wants to clarify the essence of Chinese culture and promote the spirit of Chinese culture (that is, what he calls rationality or intuition and the feudal ethical centrism, etc.), he has to stand on his own feudal Confucian position to oppose science and philosophy. At the same time, when he is shocked and bowed down to the practicality and effectiveness of Western science, and feels inferior and ashamed that China has no science, he reveals the original face of colonial ideology, advocating unconditionally and wholly accepting the science of Western capitalist society.
    In this way, we see clearly:
    Pretending to emphasize science and scientific methods—experimental logic (Dewey), logical analysis (Russell), nominal analysis or semantic analysis (Carnap)—to oppose philosophy, is actually promoting anti-scientific metaphysical methods to oppose Marxist philosophy. This is the path taken by the various schools of subjective idealism under the influence of Machism in the United States and Britain.
    From opposing talking about isms, to further opposing philosophy, pretending to emphasize science and scientific methods to oppose philosophy, is actually playing with nit-picking, trivial and fragmented textual research methods—this is still an anti-scientific metaphysical method—to oppose Marxist philosophy. The purpose is to give young people a "magic weapon for self-defense," so that they will not be "led by the nose by Marx, Lenin, and Stalin." This is the path taken by Hu Shi.
    Pretending to emphasize "rationality" and emphasize "thought" to oppose philosophy, is actually promoting mystical intuitionism to oppose the study of the history of social development and historical materialism; and starting from the thought of populism, emphasizing the uniqueness of Chinese culture to deny the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism that can be applied to the Chinese revolution. This is the path taken by Mr. Liang Shuming.
    Marxists attach great importance to philosophy. Chairman Mao defined philosophy as "the generalization and summary of knowledge about nature and knowledge about society" ("Rectify the Party's Style of Work"). Marx recognized philosophy as the "head of emancipation" of mankind. He also said, "Philosophy finds its material weapons in the proletariat, and the proletariat also finds its spiritual weapons in philosophy." (Preface to "Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Law"). From this, it can be seen that advocating science and opposing philosophy means being content with isolated and fragmented natural and social knowledge without adding philosophical generalization and summary, which is also anti-scientific. Empty talk about social reform and opposing Marxist philosophy is tantamount to abolishing the head of human emancipation and removing the spiritual weapons of the proletarian revolution, which is also opposing the revolution.
    II. Hu Shi's so-called "naturalism" is reactionary idealist thought.
    Having recognized the reactionary, erroneous, and absurd nature of Hu Shi's opposition to philosophy and its subjective idealist and agnostic essence, we can further analyze and criticize his so-called "naturalism." This "naturalism" of his is also using the promotion of science and opposition to metaphysics as a guise, opposing realistic literature in the field of literature and art, and opposing Marxist materialist philosophy in the field of philosophy. Its reactionary idealist content and essence can be mainly divided into the following two points:
    First, plagiarizing and distorting scientific common sense to smuggle in idealist goods is the main content of his so-called naturalism. In the "Preface to Science and Outlook on Life," he boasted about his "scientific outlook on life" or "naturalistic outlook on life," saying: "(1) Based on the knowledge of astronomy and physics, it makes people know the infinite size of space. (2) Based on the knowledge of geology and paleontology, it makes people know the infinite length of time. (3) Based on all science, it makes people know that the operation and change of the universe and everything in it are natural—they are so themselves—and there is no need for any supernatural master or creator." These words seem to be purely based on science, both materialistic and atheistic. However, he is unwilling to involve the fundamental philosophical issue, the fundamental fact shown by science: the principle of the primacy of matter and the secondarity of consciousness. Moreover, each article uses the phrase "based on the knowledge of a certain science," which clearly contains the idea of knowing how the universe is based on knowledge, experience, and consciousness. As for the fundamental issues studied by philosophy, he believes that they are beyond experience and have no scientific evidence, so he has to remain doubtful. Therefore, these few articles of his on the naturalistic outlook on life still contain the idea of opposing philosophy and agnosticism.
    For example, "(5) Based on the knowledge of biology, physiology, and psychology, it makes people know that humans are only one kind of animal, and that they only have differences in degree from other kinds of animals, and there is no difference in kind. (6) Based on the knowledge of biological science and anthropology, ethnology, and sociology, it makes people know the history of the evolution of biology and human society and the reasons for evolution." He believes that the difference between humans and animals is only quantitative, not qualitative. As for what the history of the evolution of human society is like and what the reasons are, he is also vague and unclear. Obviously, he is only vulgarizing Darwin's theory of evolution, not admitting that there are leaps, and obviously he will not admit that the internal contradictions of things are the source of movement and development, not admitting the history of social development, and not admitting that the struggle for production and class struggle are the causes of the evolution of human society. This shows that his so-called naturalism is only a very rough and superficial plagiarism of a little vulgarized theory of evolution.
    The above few so-called "scientific outlook on life" are still relatively deceptive. The other two articles fully expose their idealist essence: "(4) Based on the knowledge of biological science, it makes people know the waste and cruelty of the survival competition in the biological world—therefore, it makes people understand even more that the assumption of a master who 'has the virtue of loving life' cannot be established." Saying that survival competition is "waste and cruelty" has already gone beyond the scope of Darwin's original objective natural science and fallen into a subjective and idealist pessimistic tone. Darwin himself, while creating the theory of evolution, believed in God in religion. The pragmatist James believed that the assumption of the existence of God was practically effective. This shows that the conclusion of atheism cannot necessarily be drawn from pragmatism or from the facts of survival competition. Because idealists can also draw the conclusion of God with "the virtue of loving life" based on the "prosperity" and "vibrant" state of biology and the "blooming of hundreds of flowers." In short, it is futile to deny that God has the virtue of loving life by relying solely on a little subjective and idealist pessimistic tone without establishing atheism from the primacy of matter or from the social and class sources of religion. No wonder he immediately borrows and distorts scientific knowledge to establish his own "new religion." "(10) Based on the knowledge of biology and sociology, it makes people know that the individual—the 'small self'—is going to die, while humanity—the 'big self'—is immortal and imperishable; it makes people know that 'living for the whole species for all ages' is religion, and it is the highest religion." "Big self" and "small self" are commonly used terms by idealists and are by no means scientific categories of biology and sociology. Furthermore, for Hu Shi, a thorough bourgeois individualist, to talk highly about the "new religion" and "highest religion" of "living for the whole species for all ages" is not only empty and abstract, but also hypocritical and self-deceiving, because it is clearly a reactionary and deceptive ideology of cosmopolitanism. From the perspective of class essence, Hu Shi's religion is "living for the bourgeoisie, for the reactionary ruling class, and for American imperialism." These arguments of Hu Shi's precisely show his idealist and cosmopolitan reactionary essence. In his later article "On Confucianism," he compared the history of the early development of Christianity to the history of the rise of Confucianism, extolled Confucius as a religious leader, compared him to Jesus, and declared that "Confucius's new doctrine is 'benevolence as one's own responsibility,'" and he said, "'Benevolence' is the doctrine that takes all of humanity as its object." These reactionary, idealist, cosmopolitan religious views are completely consistent with the "new religion" of "living for the whole species for all ages" that he preaches under the name of "scientific outlook on life." It is a combination of thoughts that serve imperialism and thoughts that serve feudalism, which reflects the reactionary essence of the big bourgeoisie in a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society.
    Second, his "naturalism," in addition to the "scientific outlook on life" that plagiarizes and distorts scientific common sense as mentioned above, also has the content of having no distinction between essence and phenomenon, no distinction between right and wrong, and no distinction between values, and the chaotic and vague naturalism of "the unity of things and self" and universal equality. This meaning of naturalism is most prominently expressed in his "theory of social immortality," which he promoted in both Chinese and English many times. He said: "Every action, every merit and demerit, every word and deed, whether big or small, whether right or wrong, whether good or evil, of every 'small self' is forever preserved in that 'big self.'" He repeated: "All the undertakings, personality, every move, every word and smile, every thought, every achievement, every sin of every 'small self' are also eternally immortal. This is the immortality of society." (See the article "Immortality—My Religion") He affirmed on the one hand that the "'small self'—is going to die," and on the other hand he said that the smallest part of the small self "every move, every word and smile... are eternally immortal," which is self-contradictory in meaning, and it also goes against obvious facts. He himself once quoted the words of the German idealist philosopher Leibniz as the basis for his argument. This shows that he himself admits that his so-called theory of social immortality is derived from Leibniz's mystical view that "every monad reflects the entire universe."
    In addition, in his "Outline of the History of Chinese Philosophy," he once compared Zhuangzi's view of the equality of things to a person standing on top of a high tower and looking at two people of different heights on the ground, who would feel that the two people are the same height. This also shows that Hu Shi's muddled and absurd statement that all words and deeds, regardless of size, right and wrong, good and evil, are eternally immortal is also derived from Zhuangzi. Therefore, Hu Shi's vigorously touted theory of social immortality is originally this kind of mystical, idealist, chaotic and muddled thought that equates things and self, eliminates right and wrong, and forgets good and evil. This kind of thought is also of the same type as Mr. Yu Pingbo's thought that opposes "opposite contrasts" in society and the praise and blame of loyalty and treachery, good people and bad people, and red faces and black faces in literature and art. In that it opposes the evaluation of right and wrong, good and evil, loyalty and treachery, and obliterates their differences and oppositions, it is the thought of naturalism. The reactionary nature of this kind of thought lies in the fact that by obliterating the differences and oppositions between right and wrong, good and evil, loyalty and treachery, it "equally treats" and "treats equally" everything, making people cold-blooded animals without love and hate feelings and concepts of enemies and friends, and paralyzing the oppressed class's hatred and fighting will against the exploiters and the reactionary ruling class. Therefore, this kind of naturalism is an extremely reactionary viewpoint that violates the truth of Marxism-Leninism about class struggle and the struggle of contradictions. Lenin taught us that "this (class) hatred expressed by the representatives of the oppressed and exploited masses is indeed 'the mother of all wisdom.'" ("'Left-Wing' Childishness in the Communist Movement"). Stalin also taught that "the struggle of opposites, the struggle between old and new things, the struggle between decaying things and emerging things, the struggle between decadent things and developing things, is the real content of the development process" ("Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism"). From this, it can be seen that any thought that is enough to lead to the paralysis and elimination of hatred and fighting will against the exploiting classes is enough to make people leave this class hatred of "the mother of all wisdom" and is enough to hinder the process of historical progress and development.
    It must be pointed out that the reactionary bourgeoisie can never permanently conceal contradictions and always remain in a neutral state of unifying right and wrong, good and evil, and maintaining a static, intuitive, non-struggle, non-hatred state. This neutral state will inevitably lead to the "liberalism" that Hu Shi has consistently promoted, which is peaceful coexistence with the reactionary forces. When class contradictions intensify, he will inevitably reverse black and white, right and wrong, and stand on the side of the evil forces and decaying things to attack the good and emerging things. It is by no means accidental that Hu Shi became a running dog of American imperialism and a top war criminal, and that he and the people's enemy Chiang Kai-shek were alike in word and deed, one in civil matters and the other in military matters.
    This religion of "social immortality" that borrows the "scientific outlook on life" to unify right and wrong, good and evil, and then reverses right and wrong, and good and evil, he himself calls "democracy" and "equality." He believes that only worshiping a few progressive and outstanding figures such as Columbus, Washington, Newton, and Darwin as immortal is a kind of "oligarchic immortality," and only his so-called "democracy" and "equality" are sufficient where anyone "regardless of right and wrong, regardless of good and evil," "every word and smile... are eternally immortal." He repeatedly said that discovering the ancient meaning of a word has the same great merit as discovering a fixed star, that is, they are equally eternally immortal, because, according to him, "learning is equal." He elevated the discovery of the ancient meaning of a word to be equal to the discovery of a fixed star. He lowered Cai Songpo to be equal to Chen Jiongming, lowered Sun Yat-sen to be equal to Yuan Shikai, and equated Marx's socialism with Wang Yitang's "socialism," and used them equally as an excuse for not talking about isms. Taking the small as the big, taking the wrong as the right, taking the counter-revolution as the revolution, and taking "the most isolated as the most powerful," arbitrarily reversing black and white, right and wrong, is the essence of what Hu Shi calls "equality," "democracy," and "freedom."
    Democracy and science are the two great banners of the May Fourth Movement. In this way, Hu Shi stole, distorted, and used them from a reactionary standpoint and a bourgeois idealist viewpoint to oppose the revolution and serve imperialism and the Chinese reactionary ruling group. He distorted commonly used nouns to such an extent that we must be vigilant and add quotation marks to every good-sounding noun he uses in speech or writing, such as science, democracy, freedom, equality, revolution, and even experience, evolution, hypothesis, and verification, so as not to be deceived.
    III. Taking a Look in the Mirror
    As I understand it, fighting against hostile ideas is also a transformation of one's own ideas; criticizing others is also taking a look in the mirror. I have exposed and criticized the ugly face of Hu Shi's reactionary thought, and incidentally involved Mr. Liang Shuming's past idealist thought and populist thought, which seems to be a bit uncompromising and intolerant, but do I dare to face my own reactionary thought before liberation and take a look at the original shape of my ugly face at that time?
    If I do not have the determination to self-reflect and self-criticize, then I will "tolerate contradictions" (Lenin's words) and will not be able to summon the courage to criticize Hu Shi and Mr. Liang Shuming, whose thoughts once influenced me from different aspects and in different ways. In other words, criticizing the reactionary idealist thought of others is also a way of drawing a clear line between oneself and one's own past reactionary idealist thought.
    It is true that before liberation, in terms of academic thought, I and Hu Shi had contradictions between factions within idealism, but our aims of opposing the people's revolution and opposing communism were always consistent. He peddled Dewey's pragmatism, and I peddled the New Hegelianism of reactionary mystified Hegelian philosophy. Being opposed to him was only a different route to achieve the same goal of opposing Marxist philosophy. He combined Dewey's pragmatic method with the academic methods of the Qing Dynasty's Han scholars, and I combined the mystified and intuitive Hegelian idealist dialectic and Bergson's intuitionism and the Song Confucian's intuitive introspection method that I peddled from the Western bourgeoisie in order to oppose him. In fact, we were only different paths to jointly oppose materialist dialectics. He was unwilling to admit that he was an idealist, and he also put forward a "naturalistic outlook on life" to cover it up. I openly and unrestrainedly published the reactionary "A Brief Explanation of Modern Idealism" collection of essays (1939), promoting the spiritualist outlook on life in order to oppose Hu Shi, in the hope of more effectively combating materialism. I once gave a speech and publicly criticized Hu Shi's view on philosophy: He said, "Philosophy should close its doors," and I retorted, "Philosophy will never close its doors, but Hu Shi will be shut out of the door of philosophy." He said, "Philosophy is bad science," and I retorted, "Philosophy is philosophy, and science is science, each has its own scope and standards; only Hu Shi's philosophy is bad philosophy, and Hu Shi's science is bad science." The reason why I argued with him was only to fight for territory for idealist philosophy, and I felt that only idealist philosophy was enough to overcome materialist philosophy. Therefore, the ultimate goal of me and Hu Shi was no different. Not only did we have the same goal of opposing Marxist philosophy, but we also relied on a certain school of idealism in Western capitalist society on the one hand, and hoped to revive a certain school of idealism in Chinese feudal society on the other hand, harmonizing and attaching them to each other, creating a "Chinese-Western combination" to adapt to the needs of the Chinese ruling class in the semi-feudal and semi-colonial period—this method or technique was completely the same.
    I also criticized Mr. Liang Shuming's intuition, precisely because his intuition became the starting point of my past methodology. Mr. Liang described intuition as a "life attitude" and a state of inner cultivation. Although I agreed with this point, I went further. Mr. Liang's intuitive attitude is an anti-utilitarian, uncalculated, and unconcerned state of gains and losses, while I wanted to develop it into a state that does not care about pleasure, pain, good and evil, and does not distinguish between gentlemen and villains, morality and immorality based on the thoughts of Western intuitionist philosophers. In other words, the intuition that Mr. Liang talked about is a moral sensitivity or moral intuition, while I further developed it into a super-moral, artistic, and religious intuition. In this way, the intuition that I understood was also of the same type of reactionary thing as Hu Shi's and Yu Pingbo's thoughts of unifying right and wrong, good and evil. Mr. Liang denied that intuition was a method, and I further developed intuition into the ideological method of the Song Confucians in order to oppose the textual research method of the Han scholars. Mr. Liang believed that intuition was opposed to intellect, and I broke this opposition, and put forward the distinction between so-called "pre-intellectual intuition" and "post-intellectual intuition," believing that all oppositions were dialectically unified in post-intellectual intuition. Therefore, on the one hand, I dialecticized intuition, and on the other hand, I intuited and mystified dialectics. Therefore, I came to the absurd conclusion that "dialectics is a method of thought on the one hand, and on the other hand, it is not a method, but a kind of intuition." (Comrade Hu Sheng made correct and strict criticisms of my idealist views in a couple of articles in his "Reason and Freedom" collection of essays, which helped me a lot.)
    Mr. Liang Shuming wanted to inherit and promote the ideas of the Confucian Lu Xiangshan and Wang Yangming schools, which is also the route I took. But I was dissatisfied that he separated Eastern and Western cultures, believing that the directions were fundamentally different and could not be reconciled. I, on the other hand, blamed him for not knowing to seek out like-minded people in Western idealist philosophers for the Lu-Wang school of mind, and for not knowing to absorb the advantages of Christianity to enrich Confucianism and strengthen the religious spirit of Confucianism. On this point, I was closer to Hu Shi. When Hu Shi abandoned the position of "Down with the Confucian Shop" and described Confucius as a religious figure and a religious leader, I was very much in favor of it. Because I believed at

    两点批判，一点反省
    贺麟
    批判胡适的资产阶级唯心论思想，首先应有这样几点认识：
    一、胡适所传播的是西方帝国主义的反动资产阶级唯心论思想，特别是美国詹姆士和杜威那一派的反动实用主义或实验主义哲学。因此清除胡适思想在中国学术界的流毒，同时就有深入反对为现代帝国主义国家服务的反动的唯心论思想的重大意义。
    二、胡适的反动思想是旧中国半封建半殖民地社会的突出的反映，它是有代表性、典型性的意识形态。现在随着新中国人民革命的大胜利，中国的封建制度，半殖民地状态已一去不复返了。但意识的变迁每每落后于经济制度的改变，半封建半殖民地的资产阶级唯心论思想，仍然有不少的残存，甚至还有原封不动的现象。因此，批判胡适资产阶级唯心论思想就是摧毁半封建、半殖民地的旧中国的上层建筑中的一个重要堡垒，而为向着社会主义社会过渡的新中国的上层建筑、无产阶级思想、学术及文化，铺平道路。
    三、胡适的资产阶级唯心论思想并不是他一个人，或仅只他的少数门徒如俞平伯先生等的孤立的独特的思想，而是广泛存在着的现象。旧中国旧学术界的知识分子，在这一或那一形式下，直接间接都多少受过他的影响。甚至在解放前，自命与胡适的思想不一致，曾反对过他、或不理睬胡适思想的人，也都不免受过他的影响、或残存着类似胡适的资产阶级唯心论思想。各人自己反省一下，借批判胡适的反动思想，清除一下自己在观点方法上的资产阶级唯心论思想、借以提高自己的马克思列宁主义的思想水平，是很有意义的工作。
    胡适的反动的资产阶级唯心论思想，近来报章、杂志以及各学术文艺座谈会上，已揭露、批判得不少。我现在拟就胡适思想中他自认为很得意、曾同时用中文和英文发表过，且口头上曾多次宣传过的两点，加以揭露和批判。
    一、由反对研究主义进而反对研究哲学是对抗马克思主义哲学的新花招
    大家都知道，胡适提倡“多研究些问题，少谈些主义”，是针对李大钊同志当时发表的几篇介绍马克思主义的文章而发，其目的是反对谈共产主义，主张多谈枝枝节节的问题，用改良主义去代替革命。他还耍了另外一个较隐蔽的新花招，即用反对哲学研究或根本否认哲学来进一步反对马克思主义哲学，这却很少被人注意到，而是必须予以揭发的。
    在九一八事变后，他曾大唱其“哲学要关门”，“哲学家没有饭吃”的论调。他那时曾在北京协和医学院作了一个英文的演讲，（讲稿曾在当时北京英文报上发表，）大发其“哲学是坏的科学”的荒谬议论。他从孔德的反动的实证主义出发，认实证科学已代替了哲学，哲学已没有研究的领域，并以黑格尔学派的解体，作为哲学上的“树倒猢狲散”，哲学要关门的例证。完全无视辩证唯物论的出现，为哲学开一新纪元的伟大历史意义。每遇见一个专门研究哲学的人，他就一再问他：“你何不早些改行？”他在当时北京大学所讲授的“中国哲学史”课堂上，每年照例要重述一遍他的“哲学要关门”的荒谬议论。他甚至打算取消北京大学哲学系，想把个别顺着他作哲学史考据的教授转移到历史系，而迫使其他哲学教师“改行”或“没有饭吃”。北大哲学系虽未被他取消，但当时唯一用新观点讲授“左派王学”相当受学生欢迎的稽文甫先生却被迫离开北京大学了。
    以一个宣扬实验主义哲学、自称“哲学成了我的职业，文学做了我的娱乐”的胡适，在这时期何以忽然会发出根本反对哲学的议论呢？从当时中国思想界具体情况看来，一点也不奇怪。
    这首先表明他自己的实验主义哲学业已不时髦了，不能作为号召的幌子了。当时在青年中最广泛流行的是介绍马克思主义哲学的书籍，而在学院中已另有从德国和英美贩运来的较专门、较烦琐、以“高深文浅陋”的其他派系的资产阶级唯心论货色，用另一套方式在引诱青年走入唯心论的圈套，以为当时反动统治阶级服务了。换句话说，杜威派的哲学，在九一八以后，在青年群众中渐渐有失掉牵着鼻子走的效力的趋势。所以他预言哲学要关门，是具有着反对学院派哲学和青年所喜爱的马克思主义双重作用的。他反对学院派哲学乃是以唯心论反对唯心论，是资产阶级反动哲学内部的派系之争，我们这里不去管他。而他的主要矛头是指向着马克思主义哲学，是一贯地想要“解放”他所谓
  “马克思的奴隶”，反对他所谓“新典主义”那是很清楚的。因为他早就在慨叹：“孔丘朱熹的奴隶减少了，却添上了一班马克思克洛泡特金的奴隶；陈腐的古典主义打倒了，却换上了种种浅薄的新典主义。”（胡适文存，二集，卷三，一○一页）。这充分说明了他在九一八后之反对哲学和他在五四运动后之反对谈主义，其目的是一样的，只是花样翻新而已。
    此外，从思想来源看来，胡适之反对哲学、认哲学为坏的科学，与他所竭力在中国贩卖的实证主义之不可知论不可分。依胡适看来，只有他所了解的“科学”知识才是有充分证据，可以信仰的知识，凡哲学知识或者是坏的科学知识，或者是超出经验的实证，属于不可知（存疑）的领域。由此足见他之反对哲学乃是从资产阶级主观唯心论之一流派实证主义的观点派生出来的。他错误地以为各种实证科学的发展，逐渐从哲学中分化出来，独立起来，哲学的地盘好像愈来愈缩小，因而他就狂妄大胆地宣布“哲学要关门”，“哲学家没有饭吃”。殊不知科学愈发展，愈益丰富了哲学，使哲学可以总结和概括的材料愈益增多，而“贯串一切自然科学和社会科学的方法”——马克思主义哲学，更可以发挥其作用。因此，诚如日丹诺夫所说，“这种自然科学和社会科学从哲学权力束缚下解放出来的过程，无论对于自然科学和社会科学，或对于哲学本身都是一种进步过程。”（日丹诺夫在关于亚历山大洛夫著“西欧哲学史”一书讨论会上的发言）
    他公开反对哲学，片面孤立地空谈科学，不仅是从实证主义者之不可知论出发，而且是传授了他的老师杜威的衣钵。杜威认“一切理性派与经验派的争论，一切唯心论和唯物论的争论，一切从康德以来的知识论，……都是不成问题的争论，都可‘以不了了之’。”（“实验主义”）。杜威有一条重要主张，宣称“只研究人的问题，不研究哲学家的问题”（这话初出现于杜威著：“创造的智慧”一书中，后来被编“杜威哲学选集”的编者，揭示出来作为卷头语）。就认识问题而言，杜威只承认如何求知，如何思维，如何增进各部门知识的方法、技术问题，是人的问题，而贬斥世界的可知性等认识论的根本问题为“哲学家的问题”，想要“以不了了之”。他把人的问题和哲学家的问题割裂开，彷佛人的问题用不着加以深入的概括、哲学的探讨。而杜威所谓人的问题实质上绝不是人民的问题，工人的问题，而只是资本家、剥削阶级的问题。
    反对哲学，从而根本反对马克思主义哲学，也不仅是杜威一派的主张。譬如，当罗素认为我们只能认识部分，不能认识全体，“认识一件事物，并不逻辑地包含对于它的诸多关系的知识”时，当他说，“我们只得对于世界加以零碎的考察（Piecemca-linvestigation）对于我们经验较远的那些部分的宇宙的性质，我们是不能够知道的。……这种结果虽说有点令人失望，但却与我们这个时代的归纳的和科学的气质相符合”时，（以上引文均见罗素著“哲学问题”书中论哲学知识的限度一章）他不单是表现了反动的主观唯心论，也不单表现了唯心的不可知论，他也表现了与胡适一鼻孔出气的反对哲学的主张。他教人“对于世界加以零碎考察”，和他所谓“归纳的和科学的气质”，也就是和胡适所谓“一点一滴的”考证方法，同样具有反对马克思主义哲学，反对用辩证法来考察宇宙人生的实际的政治意义。
    此外罗素的嫡系，现在特别流行于美国的各式各样的逻辑实证论者，大都指斥研究唯物、唯心等哲学上的根本问题为超出经验实证范围的“玄学”，他们认为哲学只是个人性情的表现，不能给予人以知识和真理。他们根本否认辩证法是方法，把马克思主义的唯物论也算做“玄学”。他们并且认为只有“物理的语言”才是“科学的统一的语言”，凡是哲学上的命题，他们认为不能翻译成“物理的语言”的，都叫做没有意义的命题。这种反映帝国主义没落时期的反动的哲学流派，和胡适之反对哲学，认哲学为坏的科学的荒谬说法，同是走的资产阶级主观唯心论的道路。
    所以不管他们在别的方面有许多的差别，我们可以把胡适和杜威、罗素及逻辑实证论者如卡纳普等人，放在一起，作为现代世界潮流中，替帝国主义服务的资产阶级唯心论的代表。他们的共同之点如下：一、他们都是唯心论者——主观唯心论者，他们共同的主要的思想来源就是列宁曾经用力加以毁灭性的打击的反动的马赫主义。他们认为只能认识经验及经验以内的东西，离经验、意识而独立的物质或客观实在是不可知，不能“实证”的。二、他们都反对辩证法，杜威以他所谓“实验逻辑”，罗素及逻辑实证论者以其所谓形式的、支离空疏的“逻辑分析”及“语意分析”或“名词分析”，胡适以他所谓“大胆假设，小心求证”的考据方法来代替真正科学方法，来反对辩证法。他们都形而上学地、把科学和哲学割裂开，反对哲学而片面地推尊科学，反对从全面、从关系，特别反对从内在联系来看事物，妄以为个别事物可以脱离全体、脱离关系，孤立地、零碎地来考察。三、他们都反对从全面、从联系来认识事物，他们反对谈革命的主义、反对建立合理的哲学的世界观和人生观，因此在政治上他们全是主张放任主观性情、嗜好、意见的个人民主主义者，反动的自由主义者和改良主义者。
    反对哲学——实即根本反对马克思主义哲学不仅是英美帝国主义没落时期的资产阶级唯心论的一个大趋势，而且在半封建半殖民地的旧中国，除了胡适以外，也还有不少的代表。如梁漱溟先生的思想，好多地方好像与胡适对立，但他只注重中国文化、社会、政治上的问题的研究，只谈“儒家的生活态度”或“中国文化的路向”等，而讳言主义，却与胡适相同。解放后很长一段时间内，他还不承认他自己的观点是属于唯心主义范畴。解放后才出版的，目的在叙述他“对于中国历史和文化的见解”的书，叫做“中国文化要义”，也明确地表现他同胡适一样有着反对哲学——基本上是反对马克思主义哲学的思想。他在这书的序言中说：“什么‘社会发展史’，什么‘文化哲学’，我当初都未曾设想到这些，更无意玩弄这一套。”他谈中国问题，一方面从他自己的主观“直觉”出发，一方面摘引许多零碎事实，援引许多别人与他气味相投的话去印证他的直觉见解。他用反对“学究式的研究”，反对“空名词假概念”的口号来反对“社会发展史”、“文化哲学”的研究。他无意乎玩弄“社会发展史”那一套，也就是根本反对马克思主义哲学的一个重要组成部分——历史唯物论。
    当然梁漱溟先生反对哲学与胡适反对哲学的根据及出发点是不同的。胡适认哲学是坏的科学，他要提倡“科学”，就得反对哲学。梁漱溟先生乃是从注重直觉（在中国文化要义一书中，他已不用“直觉”这一名词，而以他所特有意义的“理性”代之。他所谓“理性”基本上即是他在“东西文化及其哲学”书中所谓“直觉”。）反对理智出发。所以他说，他“所致力者，盖不徒在见闻思辨之间；见闻思辨而外，大有事在。这又是与一般哲学家不同处”。因为他注重“见闻思辨而外”的直觉，故他反对注重见闻思辨，注重理智的哲学。实际上他乃是赞成直觉主义的神秘派的哲学。所以他又说：“科学从理智来；从理性（直觉）来底却不属科学。此其中（指理性之中）大部分只是思想（包含哲学及主义），而非知识了”。这意思是说，理性之中大部分只是“思想”（思想在这里亦应作直觉解），哲学及政治上的主义也只是属于“理性”（直觉）方面的，而不是理智，亦不是知识。据他们看，哲学及政治上的主义、道德上的判断，只是情意的表示，不是知识，更与科学无关，这恰好与现在正流行于美国的反动的逻辑实证论者卡纳普等人的见解，不谋而合。关于这一流派的唯心论实质和反动实质，上面已经提到过。其目的在于使他们政治上的主张，宗教道德上的信仰，既不受科学规律的支配，也不受哲学的合理的世界观和人生观的指导，而纯粹建筑在他们的主观武断的直觉、意见、感情、任性、嗜好、偏见之上。这充分表现其为资产阶级主观唯心论。
    梁漱溟先生又说：“中国后世之无科学，即为其古代无哲学，哲学只是西洋所有物，亦犹乎科学只是西洋有之。”（中国文化要义，三○八页）这样，他就把科学和哲学都拱手让给西洋人，在中国文化遗产中他就根本看不见科学和哲学的痕迹。当他要阐明中国文化的要义，发扬中国文化的精神
  （即他所谓理性或直觉及封建的伦理本位等），就不得不站在他自己的封建的儒家立场来反对科学和哲学了。同时，当他震惊拜倒于西洋科学的实用和实效，自卑自惭于中国之没有科学时，他又露出殖民地思想的本来面目，主张无条件地全盘接受西洋资本主义社会的科学了。
    这样我们看清楚了：
    假借注重科学和科学方法——实验逻辑（杜威），逻辑分析法（罗素），名词分析法或语意分析法（卡纳普），以反对哲学，实际上是提倡反科学的形而上学方法以反对马克思主义哲学，这是美英帝国主义国家中在马赫派影响下的主观唯心论诸流派所采取的道路。
    由反对谈主义，进而反对哲学，假借注重科学和科学方法，以反对哲学，实际上是在玩弄钻牛角尖的琐屑破碎的考证方法——这仍然是反科学的形而上学方法——，以反对马克思主义哲学，目的在于给予青年以“防身法宝”，使不要被“马克思、列宁、斯大林牵着鼻子走。”这是胡适所走的道路。
    假借注重“理性”、注重“思想”，以反对哲学，实际上是提倡神秘的直觉主义以反对对社会发展史、历史唯物论的研究；并且从民粹派的思想出发，强调中国文化的独特性，以否认马克思列宁主义的普遍真理之可以应用于中国革命。这是梁漱溟先生所走的道路。
    马克思主义者对于哲学是非常重视的。毛主席把哲学规定为“关于自然知识和社会知识的概括和总结”（“整顿党的作风”）。马克思认哲学为人类“解放的头脑”。又说，“哲学在无产阶级那里找到它的物质的武器，无产阶级也在哲学那里找到它的精神的武器。”（“黑格尔法律哲学批判”序言，）由此可见，提倡科学，而反对哲学，即是安于孤立片断的自然和社会知识，而不加以哲学的概括和总结，也即是反科学。空谈社会改革而反对马克思主义哲学，是不啻取消人类解放的头脑，解除无产阶级革命的精神武器，亦即是反对革命。
    二、胡适所谓“自然主义”是反动的唯心论思想
    认识了胡适反对哲学的反动性、错误性、荒谬性及其主观唯心论和不可知论的实质，我们可以进一步分析批判一下他所标榜的“自然主义”了。他这种“自然主义”也是借提倡科学、反对玄学作为幌子，在文艺方面反对现实主义的文艺，在哲学方面反对马克思主义唯物论哲学。它的反动的唯心论的内容实质，主要的可分下述两点：
    第一，抄袭并歪曲科学常识，以偷运唯心论的货色，就是他所谓自然主义的主要内容。他在“科学与人生观序”里大吹其“科学的人生观”或“自然主义的人生观”说：“（1）根据于天文学和物理学的知识，叫人知道空间的无穷之大。（2）根据于地质学及古生物学的知识，叫人知道时间的无穷之长。（3）根据于一切科学，叫人知道宇宙及其中万物的运行变迁皆是自然的，——自己如此的，——正用不着什么超自然的主宰或造物者。”这些话表面上好像是纯粹从科学出发，既是唯物论又是无神论，然而哲学上的根本问题，科学所昭示的根本事实：物质第一性，意识第二性的原则，他却不愿涉及，而且每条都用“根据某某科学的知识”的语句，显然包含有从知识、经验、意识出发，知道宇宙如何如何，而对于哲学所研究的根本问题，则认为是超出经验之外，没有科学证据，只好存疑。所以他这几条自然主义的人生观仍然包含有反对哲学和不可知论的思想在内的。
    又如“（5）根据于生物学、生理学、心理学的知识，叫人知道人不过是动物的一种，他和别种动物只有程度的差异，并无种类的区别。（6）根据于生物的科学及人类学、人种学、社会学的知识，叫人知道生物及人类社会演进的历史和演进的原因。”他认为人与动物只有量的差异，没有质的差异。至于人类社会演进的历史怎样，原因是什么，他也模糊说不清楚，显然他只是庸俗化达尔文的进化论，不承认有飞跃，显然他更不会承认事物内在的矛盾是运动发展的根源，不承认社会发展史，不承认生产斗争和阶级斗争是人类社会演进的原因。足见他所谓自然主义只是很潦草粗浅地抄袭了一点子庸俗化的进化论。
    以上几条所谓“科学的人生观”还比较可以欺骗人，另外两条就十足暴露其唯心论的实质了：“（4）根据于生物的科学的知识，叫人知道生物界的生存竞争的浪费与惨酷，——因此，叫人更可以明白那“有好生之德”的主宰的假设是不能成立的。”说生存竞争是“浪费与惨酷”业已超出达尔文原来客观的自然科学的范围，而陷入主观的唯心的悲观论调。达尔文本人一面创立进化论，一面相信宗教上的上帝。实用主义者詹姆士就认为上帝存在的假设是有实际效用的。足见从实用主义，从生存竞争的事实均不一定能得出无神论的结论来。因为唯心论者又何尝不可根据生物之“欣欣向荣”、“活泼泼地”，“百花齐放”，而得出“有好生之德”的上帝来。总之，不从物质第一性，不从宗教的社会根源和阶级根源去建立无神论，要想单凭一点主观的唯心的悲观论调去否认上帝有好生之德是徒劳的。无怪乎他下面立刻又假借并歪曲科学知识来建立他自己的“新宗教”了。“（十）根据于生物学及社会学的知识，叫人知道个人——‘小我’——是要死灭的，而人类——‘大我’——是不死的，不朽的；叫人知道‘为全种万世而生活’就是宗教，就是最高的宗教。”“大我”、“小我”是唯心论者常用的名词，绝不是作为科学的生物学和社会学的范畴。再则以彻头彻尾的资产阶级个人主义的胡适，而高谈
  “为全种万世而生活”的“新宗教”、“最高的宗教”，不惟空洞抽象，而且虚伪自欺，因为这明明是一种反动的骗人的世界主义的思想，从阶级实质看来，胡适的宗教乃是“为资产阶级、为反动统治阶级、为美帝国主义而生活”。胡适这些论调不正是表现了他的唯心论和世界主义的反动实质。他后来在“说儒”一文中，以基督教初期发展的历史比拟儒家兴起的历史，推尊孔子为教主，拿来和耶稣相比拟，并且宣称“孔子的新教义就是‘仁以为己任’的‘仁’”，他说，“‘仁’就是那用整个人类为对象的教义。”——这类反动的唯心的世界主义的宗教观点完全是和他假借“科学的人生观”的名义，而宣扬的“为全种万世而生活”的“新宗教”相一致的，完全是为帝国主义服务的思想和为封建主义服务的思想的结合，正反映了半封建半殖民地社会中大资产阶级的反动实质。
    第二，他的“自然主义”除了上面所说的假借并歪曲科学常识的“科学人生观”外，还有无本质现象之分，无是非价值之别，“物我齐一”，一律平等的混沌模糊的自然主义的内容。这个意义的自然主义最突出地表现在他用中文和英文宣传了多少遍的“社会的不朽论”里。他说：“每一个‘小我’的一切作为，一切功德罪恶，一切语言行事，无论大小，无论是非，无论善恶，一一都永远留存在那个‘大我’之中。”又重复说：“一切‘小我’的事业、人格、一举一动、一言一笑、一个念头、一场功劳、一桩罪过，也都永远不朽。这便是社会的不朽。”（见“不朽——我的宗教”一文）他一面肯定“‘小我’——是要死灭的”，一面又说小我的最微小的部分“一举一动，一言一笑……都永远不朽”，语意自相矛盾，且还反显明的事实，姑且不管。他自己曾引用德国唯心论哲学家莱布尼兹的话作为他立说的根据。足见他自己也承认，他所谓社会不朽论是自莱布尼兹的“每一单子反映全宇宙”的神秘主义观点袭取得来。
    此外在他的“中国哲学史大纲”中，他曾比喻庄子的齐物观点，犹如一个人站在高塔顶上远望平地两个高低不同的人，会觉得两个人是一样高低。这又足见胡适这种一切言语行事，无论大小、是非、善恶，永远不朽的糊涂荒谬说法，又是从庄子袭取得来。所以胡适大吹大擂的社会不朽论原来是这种齐物我、泯是非、忘善恶的神秘的唯心的混沌糊涂思想。这种思想也就是和俞平伯先生反对社会上的“相反的对照”，文艺上对于忠奸、好人坏人、红脸黑脸的褒贬的思想属于同一类型。就它反对是非善恶忠奸的评价，抹煞其差别性与对立性说，就是自然主义的思想。这种思想的反动性在于由抹煞是非善恶忠奸的区别和对立，对一切“等量齐观”、
  “一视同仁”，使人成为没有爱恨感情和敌友观念的冷血动物，麻痹被压迫阶级的人对剥削者和反动统治阶级的仇恨情绪和斗争意志。因此这种自然主义乃是极端违反马克思列宁主义关于阶级斗争和矛盾斗争的真理的反动观点。列宁教导我们说：“被压迫和被剥削群众的代表所表现的这种（阶级）仇恨，实在是‘一切智慧之母’”。（“共产主义运动中的‘左派’幼稚病”）。斯大林复教导说，“对立面的斗争，旧东西与新东西间的斗争，衰亡着的东西和产生着的东西间的斗争，衰颓着的东西和发展着的东西间的斗争，便是发展过程底实在内容”（“辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义”）。由此足见，任何足以导至麻痹、消灭对于剥削阶级的仇恨情绪和斗争意志的思想，都足以使人离开这“一切智慧之母”的阶级仇恨，且足以阻碍历史进步发展的过程。
    必须指出：反动的资产阶级决不能永远掩饰矛盾，老停留在齐一是非善恶，保持静态的直观的无斗争、无仇恨的中立状态。这种中立状态必然导至与反动势力和平共处的胡适所一贯宣扬的“自由主义”。到了阶级矛盾尖锐化时，他必然要颠倒黑白是非，站在恶势力和衰亡着的东西一边向善的新生着的东西进攻。胡适成为美帝国主义的走狗，成为头等战争罪犯，与人民公敌蒋介石一文一武，异曲同工，决不是偶然的。
    这种假借“科学的人生观”来齐一是非善恶并进而颠倒是非善恶的“社会不朽论”的宗教，他还自己诡称为“民主”、为“平等”。他认为光尊崇少数进步的卓越人物如哥仑布、华盛顿、牛顿、达尔文为不朽，是一种“寡头的不朽论”，只有他所宣扬的任何人“无论是非、无论善恶”、“一言一笑，……都永远不朽”，才够“民主”、“平等”。他一再说，发明一个字的古义与发现一颗恒星，有同样大的功绩，也就是同样永远不朽，因为据他说，“学问是平等的”。他把发现一个字的古义捧到与发现一颗恒星相平等。他把蔡松坡降到与陈炯明相平等，把孙中山降到与袁世凯相平等，把马克思的社会主义拿来与王揖唐的“社会主义”等量齐观，同样作为不应该谈主义的借口。以小为大，以非为是，以反革命为革命、以“最孤立为最强有力”，任意颠倒黑白是非，就是胡适所谓“平等”、
  “民主”、“自由”的实质。
    民主和科学是五四运动的两面大旗，就这样被胡适从反动立场和资产阶级唯心论的观点盗窃了、歪曲了、利用了来反对革命、来为帝国主义和中国反动统治集团服务。他歪曲一般正常通用的名词竟达到这样一种程度，以致我们必须提高警惕，对于他口头或笔下的每一个好听的名词，如科学，民主、自由、平等、革命，甚至经验、进化、假设、求证等等，都应当加一个引号，以免受骗。
    三、自己照一下镜子
    据我了解，向敌对思想作斗争同时就是对自己思想的一种改造；批评别人同时也是自己照一下镜子。我揭露并批判了胡适反动思想的丑恶面貌，顺便还牵涉到和我们一起住在北京的梁漱溟先生旧日的唯心论思想和民粹派思想，好像很有一点不妥协、不容忍的样子，但是我又敢不敢正视自己在解放以前的反动思想，照一照自己那时丑恶面目的原形呢？
    我若没有自我反省、自我批评的决心，那一定会“姑息矛盾”（列宁语），提不起勇气来批判从前曾经从不同方面，在不同方式下影响过我的思想的胡适和梁漱溟先生了。换言之，批判别人的反动唯心论思想，也就是自己要和自己过去的反动唯心论思想划清界限的一个表现方式。
    诚然，在解放前在学术思想方面我和胡适曾有过唯心论内部派系间的矛盾，但反人民革命、反共产主义的目的，我和他却始终一致。他贩运杜威的实用主义，我贩运反动的神秘化黑格尔哲学的新黑格尔主义，和他相对立，也只是分途去达到反对马克思主义哲学的同一目的。他把杜威实用主义的方法与清代汉学家的治学方法相结合，我把从西方资产阶级那里贩来的神秘化直觉化的黑格尔唯心辩证法与柏格森的直觉主义和宋儒的直觉内省方法相结合，以与他相对立，其实也只是共同反对唯物论辩证法的不同途径。他不愿承认他是唯心论者，他还提出“自然主义的人生观”以作掩饰，我公开放肆地刊行反动的“近代唯心论简释”的论文集（一九三九），宣扬精神主义的人生观以和胡适相对立，以期更有效地打击唯物论。我曾作过演讲公开批评过胡适对哲学的看法：他说，“哲学要关门”，我反驳道，“哲学永远不会关门，胡适倒会被关在哲学的大门之外。”他说，“哲学是坏的科学”，我反驳道，“哲学是哲学，科学是科学，各有其范围和标准；只有胡适的哲学是坏的哲学，胡适的科学是坏的科学。”我之所以同他辩争，本意不过是替唯心论哲学争地盘，觉得只有唯心论哲学才足以克服唯物论哲学。所以，最终目的我和胡适并无不同。不唯反马克思主义哲学的目的相同，而且一方面依靠西洋资本主义社会某一派的唯心论，一方面希图复活中国封建社会某一派唯心论，两相调和附会，来一个“中西合璧”，以适应半封建半殖民地的中国统治阶级的需要，——这种方式或手法也完全相同。
    我附带批评了梁漱溟先生的直觉，也正由于他的直觉思想成了我过去的方法论的出发点。梁先生把直觉说成是一种“生活态度”，一种内心修养境界。我虽然赞同这一点，但我还走得远些。梁先生的直觉态度是反功利的、不算账的、不计较利害得失的境界，而我要根据西洋直觉派哲学家的思想，把它发展为不计较苦乐善恶，不分辨君子小人，道德与不道德的境界。换言之，梁先生所讲的直觉是一种道德敏感或道德的直觉，而我进而把它发展为超道德的、艺术的、宗教的直觉。这样我所了解的直觉，也就与胡适、俞平伯齐一是非善恶的思想是同类型的反动的东西了。梁先生否认直觉为一种方法，我进而把直觉发挥成宋儒的思想方法，以与汉学家的考据方法相对立。梁先生认直觉与理智相对立，我打破了这种对立，提出有所谓“前理智的直觉”和“后理智的直觉”的区别，认为在后理智的直觉中一切对立得到了辩证的统一。于是我一方面把直觉辩证法化，另一方面又把辩证法直觉化，神秘化。因此我得到了“辩证法一方面是思想方法，一方面又不是方法，而是一种直观。”这样荒谬的结论。（胡绳同志在他的“理性与自由”论文集中，有一两篇文章对我这些唯心论观点作过正确而严整的批评，对我的帮助很大。）
    梁漱溟先生想要承继并发扬儒家陆象山、王阳明学派的思想，这也是我所走的路线。但是我不满意于他把东西文化割裂开，认为路向根本不同，不能调和。而我却怪他不知道在西洋唯心论哲学家中去寻求陆王心学的同道，不知道吸收基督教的优点来充实儒家，加强儒家的宗教精神。在这一点上，我比较接近胡适，当胡适放弃了“打倒孔家店”的立场，把孔子说成像一个宗教家和教主时，我是非常赞成的。因为我那时认为马克思主义是有足以感动青年的宗教精神的，唯心论也必须乞灵于宗教，才能抵制马克思主义。
    简言之，我曾经宣扬神秘化的直觉和直觉化的唯心辩证法以对抗唯物辩证法，我曾经要求把儒家思想更宗教化，更其与西方资产阶级唯心论相结合，以便更好为蒋介石所御用的旧三民主义作“哲学”基础，以抵制马克思主义哲学。此外，我因为要想推尊陆王派的主观唯心论以抵制新哲学，于是在一本“当代中国哲学”的反动册子里，我把近五十年来中国哲学的发展，都看成陆王哲学的复兴史。我把康有为、谭嗣同、梁启超、欧阳竟无、熊十力、马一浮均装扮成陆王学派的思想家，并把孙中山的知难行易说及蒋介石的法西斯思想，所谓“力行哲学”解释成陆王学派之发为事功的具体表现。尤其反动的是因为蒋介石也喜欢一种神秘唯心的辩证法，我还很无耻地迎合他的意旨，企图用唯心辩证法正反合的公式来阐述旧三民主义以反抗共产主义。
    总之，我自己检查一下，（虽说还揭露得很不够），我宣扬唯心论比胡适更公开、更放肆，我提倡直觉比梁漱溟先生更极端、更神秘。我用唯心论和唯心论辩证法直接去为旧三民主义辩护，直接为蒋匪的法西斯统治服务，也到了公开无耻、渎亵哲学和辩证法的程度。
    自己一照镜子，过去思想的真实面貌，既然如此丑恶反动，解放后，人民对我宽大，党耐心团结我、教育我，青年同志和进步的朋友们大力挽救我，使我得安静地学习、研究、作光荣的人民教师。现在我并不是妄想抛头露面，摆起进步的样子，去斗争那日慕途穷的死老虎胡适的思想，还要东拉西扯地向梁漱溟先生提意见。反之，我乃是以充满了欣幸和感激的心情，以一定要解放台湾，反对美帝国主义的政治积极性来参加这一场严重的思想斗争。
    首先，我很欣幸，现在批判胡适思想，已和从前资产阶级唯心论内部的派系之争有了本质的不同，我是在参加无产阶级思想对资产阶级思想的严肃的阶级斗争。我是站在人民的立场，为过渡到社会主义社会的新中国树立马克思列宁主义在学术思想上的领导权而斗争。
    其次，我对胡适的批判正是伟大的马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想五年来在我身上所起的改造作用之具体表现。像我这样有了如此深重的反动唯心论思想的人都可以改造过来，得到新生，其他的包袱较轻的旧知识分子自我改造的信心与勇气更可加强，因而这一场马克思主义唯物论对胡适派资产阶级唯心论斗争的胜利更可保证了。
    再次，我向曾经影响过我思想的梁漱溟先生提意见，表示我对他的帮助，希望他也能检查一下自己的思想，在这场斗争里得到提高和改造。同时也表示我批判他的直觉思想，正由于我深切痛恨自己过去的反科学的、反唯物辩证法的直觉思想。
    最后，学习毛主席的矛盾论，其中论矛盾的转化的原则特别给我以更新改造的无限鼓舞和勇气。通过认真学习马克思列宁主义，懂得了阶级斗争的真理。在努力实践和劳动的过程中，人可以从落后的改造成为进步的；能够抛掉反动唯心的思想，而接受革命唯物论的思想；能够丢掉旧包袱，争取新成就；批判自己违反人民利益的活动，而努力于服务人民的活动。我希望通过这次对胡适批判广泛而深入的无产阶级思想对资产阶级唯心论的斗争，在许多人，特别在旧知识分子中，在思想上、生活上、学术研究工作上可以引起一个根本的改造。
