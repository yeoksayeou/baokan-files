    Strengthen the Study of the Ideology of the Worker-Peasant Alliance and Actively Promote China's Socialist Construction
    Wu Jiang
    The ideology of the worker-peasant alliance is one of the most important foundations of the Marxist-Leninist theory of proletarian revolution, a component of the problem of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the cornerstone of all revolutionary policies of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.  Studying the ideology of the worker-peasant alliance diligently is of extremely significant importance for advancing China's socialist construction.

    Marx and Engels only generally pointed out the laws of capitalist development in agriculture, the deep revolutionary roots of working peasants, and the extreme necessity of the proletariat forming a revolutionary alliance with working peasants to realize its leadership.  Lenin developed Marx and Engels' hints regarding the peasant question under new historical conditions.  Lenin argued about this issue from the perspective of the proletariat needing to seize power and win the dictatorship of the proletariat, thereby establishing a rigorous system of proletarian leadership.  It was from this viewpoint that Lenin smashed the various opportunist lines of the Second International parties of Western Europe and the Mensheviks and Trotskyists of Russia in their treatment of the peasant question.  Based on the law of uneven economic and political development of capitalist countries in the era of imperialism, Lenin pointed out that socialism could not mature simultaneously in all links of the world capitalist system, and that the demise of capitalism and the victory of socialism would be achieved through individual countries breaking away from the capitalist system. In these countries, the proletariat, forming an alliance with the basic peasant masses to seize power, could achieve victory.  And the proletariat's leadership in this alliance is a necessary guarantee for achieving the victory of the democratic revolution and smoothly transitioning this revolution to the socialist revolution.

    The great October Socialist Revolution vividly confirmed Lenin's brilliant ideology. The alliance between the Russian proletariat and revolutionary peasants first broke through the front lines of world imperialism, established the dictatorship of the proletariat, and opened a new era in world history, the era of socialist victory.

    Based on new historical conditions and the practical experience of the proletarian revolution, Lenin elucidated the formula of the dictatorship of the proletariat, stipulating that the dictatorship of the proletariat is a special form of class alliance between the proletariat (the leader) and the peasants and other exploited masses (the led).  Lenin expanded the rigorous system of proletarian leadership in the cause of overthrowing the Tsarist system and overthrowing capitalism into a rigorous system of leadership over the urban and rural working masses in the cause of socialist construction during the period of the dictatorship of the proletariat.  Lenin believed that the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class, aimed at opposing the exploiting classes, is the highest principle of the dictatorship of the proletariat.  Only by following such a principle can the leading role of the proletariat and state power be maintained, and the tasks of the dictatorship of the proletariat be completed.

    The question of the victory of socialism in one country is, domestically, a question of the relationship between the various classes within the country.  Lenin believed that the alliance between the proletariat and the peasants, although an alliance between classes that are economically, politically, and spiritually different, and therefore has certain contradictions, since the interests of the dictatorship of the proletariat are consistent with the fundamental interests of the peasants, and the socialist system can fully satisfy the interests of both, the proletariat can overcome its contradictions with the peasants, consolidate its alliance with the peasants, and attract the peasant masses to participate in socialist construction.  Therefore, the dictatorship of the proletariat can not only overcome all the difficulties caused by the country's economic and technological backwardness, but also completely defeat the domestic bourgeoisie economically, eliminate the exploiting classes, and build a socialist society.

    In the period of transition from capitalism to socialism, regarding the methods and paths of building socialism, Lenin's great contribution to Marxism also lies in: Starting from the situation of Russia, a country dominated by small farmers and small production (Lenin believed that this situation determined the form of transition to socialism), he formulated specific methods for economic policy, enabling the proletariat, which held the economic lifeline, to use these specific methods to combine socialist industry with agriculture, thereby guiding the entire national economy towards socialism; he formulated specific methods for gradually guiding the basic peasant masses onto the track of socialist construction through cooperatives, believing that cooperatives are the most powerful tool for the dictatorship of the proletariat to transform the small-peasant economy and transform the peasants in a socialist spirit. These included the essence of Lenin's plan to build socialism in the Soviet Union. This plan is specifically manifested in the New Economic Policy.

    The New Economic Policy implemented by the Soviet regime during the transition period was an economic policy aimed at using the market, commerce, etc., to enable socialist components to defeat capitalist components and build socialism. The essence of this policy was the economic alliance between the working class and the peasants. Lenin pointed out in his report to the Ninth All-Russian Congress of Soviets: "When we are committed to deciding on the New Economic Policy, we must formulate the form of the worker-peasant alliance for it, for this new society."

    In this way, based on Lenin's plan to build socialism in the Soviet Union, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union planned a path for the working class to lead the peasants to embark on the socialist road throughout the transition period. This path is: Mastering the economic lifeline of the national economy through socialist nationalization, establishing a commercial combination between socialism and the peasant economy; implementing state socialist industrialization, using the method of supplying the countryside with advanced machinery and technology to establish a production combination with the countryside; implementing agricultural collectivization, establishing a socialist economic foundation in the countryside.

    The task of socialism is to eliminate exploitation and eliminate classes, which is easy for any true Marxist to understand. However, when this issue is linked to the practical solution of the problem of the vast number of small producers in the intermediate strata (mainly peasants), it becomes extremely complicated. Lenin's great achievement lies in: he made a profound scientific argument on the connection between the two tasks of eliminating the exploiting classes and transforming the intermediate strata, and on the differences in the methods of solving them, and effectively solved this most complex task facing socialism. In his programmatic work on socialist construction, "Economics and Politics in the Era of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat," Lenin pointed out that landlords and capitalists can be overthrown in one fell swoop, but the task of transforming peasants and eliminating the differences between workers and peasants cannot be solved by overthrowing them. To solve this task, it is necessary to transform the entire social economy on the basis of the worker-peasant alliance, and transition the individual, separate small commodity economy to a public, large economy; when transforming peasants, it is necessary to always pay attention to distinguishing between the two aspects of peasants as laborers and private owners. As laborers, peasants tend to side with the proletariat; as private owners, they tend to side with the bourgeoisie. In the process of building socialism, the proletariat pays attention to the fundamental interests of peasants as laborers, while the bourgeoisie attempts to exploit the interests of peasants as private owners. Lenin believed that distinguishing between these two aspects of peasants is the entire essence of socialism.

    Therefore, Lenin believed that, in the transition period, the task of the Party and the Soviet state is to strengthen the leading role of the working class in the worker-peasant alliance a hundredfold, and in the policy towards peasants, the following basic line should be consistently implemented: rely on the poor peasants, firmly unite with the middle peasants, and conduct an irreconcilable struggle against the rich peasants. Lenin pointed out that any move that violates this line will harm the cause of socialist construction and the worker-peasant alliance, and make the actual comparison of class struggle and class forces favorable to the bourgeoisie and unfavorable to the working class. Lenin repeatedly emphasized that when the working class resolves its contradictions with the peasants, it should attach importance to the personal interests of the peasants, "not directly based on enthusiasm, but with the help of the enthusiasm generated by the great revolution, based on personal interests, based on personal interests, based on economic accounting," and pay attention to correctly combining the personal interests of the peasants with the public interests, and making the personal interests of the peasants subordinate to the public interests. And Lenin believed that the cooperative form is the only correct economic form that can correctly combine the personal interests of the peasants with the public interests and make them subordinate to the public interests, and gradually incorporate the basic peasant masses into the track of socialist construction.

    Following Lenin's instructions, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, in its activities, finally fully realized the goals expected by Lenin, that is, on the basis of the worker-peasant alliance, it eliminated the exploiting classes and transformed the vast intermediate strata, built a complete socialist society, and established a new and higher form of the worker-peasant alliance on this basis—the form of the alliance between the working class and the collective peasants.

    Lenin's ideology of the worker-peasant alliance was further developed in Stalin's works and in the resolutions of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    Lenin's ideology of the worker-peasant alliance armed the working class and communist parties of all countries. The revolutionary road victoriously traveled by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong is based on Lenin's teaching that the main point of the communist tactics implemented by the working-class parties in colonial countries and backward countries with peasants as their main masses is to seek specific forms and specific paths of the worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the working class, and combine this path with the assistance of the socialist countries that have already won victory, so that these countries can avoid the stage of capitalist development and transition to socialism through certain forms.  The facts are exactly like this. Lenin's teachings and the path expected by Lenin have been realized in a typical form in China, a large country with a population of 600 million.

    The worker-peasant alliance in China during the New Democratic Revolution was forged by our Party based on the characteristics of China's political and economic development, the specific comparison of the nature of China's revolution and class forces, and based on Comrade Mao Zedong's theory that to seize power by armed force under specific conditions in China, it is necessary to first occupy the countryside and then take the cities, in the long-term revolutionary war in which the vanguard of the working class went deep into the countryside to lead the peasants.  And this was formed in a united front environment of cooperation and struggle with the bourgeoisie (both in the past and today, the worker-peasant alliance is the basic force of the revolutionary united front).  Such an alliance cannot but have its own characteristics in terms of its form and tasks.  But all this of course proves nothing else, but proves the universal guiding significance and vivid power of Lenin's ideology of the worker-peasant alliance, and proves that the Chinese Communist Party is good at specifically grasping and applying this powerful weapon of Leninism in its own environment.

    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, that is, since the transformation of the Chinese revolution from the New Democratic Revolution to the Socialist Revolution, the strength of China's worker-peasant alliance has not weakened compared to the past, but has greatly increased.  The leadership of the working class and the foundation of the worker-peasant alliance mark the fundamental nature of our people's democratic country.  In the socialist revolution, that is, the period of socialist transformation, the alliance of the working class leading the peasants to fight to overthrow the rule of the three major enemies in China must be transformed into the alliance of the working class leading the peasants to take the socialist road, that is, to fight for the transition to socialism.  Due to the transformation of the nature and tasks of the revolution, and due to the implementation of the Party's general line in the transition period, the contradiction between feudalism and democracy in the countryside has been replaced by the contradiction between capitalism and socialism.  The peasants themselves have begun to change, gradually changing from individual peasants with unstable economic lives to cooperative peasants.  The Party's policy towards peasants in the land reform (relying on poor and hired peasants, uniting with middle peasants, neutralizing rich peasants, and eliminating the landlord class step by step) has been replaced by a new policy (relying on poor peasants (including new middle peasants who were originally poor peasants), firmly uniting with middle peasants, and restricting and gradually eliminating the rich peasant economy).  Due to the above-mentioned changes, in the process of transforming the worker-peasant alliance in the democratic revolution stage into the worker-peasant alliance in the socialist revolution stage, there are some problems in people's understanding.

    On the one hand, the facts of the past few years have shown that not everyone (including peasants) fully understands the issues of the leading role of the working class, which is of decisive significance in socialist construction, the construction of large-scale industry, which is the material basis of socialist construction, and the various necessary measures taken by the state to further strengthen the position of the leadership of the working class and give priority to promoting the construction of large-scale industry. For example, whether to prioritize the development of heavy industry or prioritize the development of light industry; under the current situation where production cannot keep up with needs, whether to implement unified purchase and sales of grain and other most important daily consumer goods or continue to allow the existence of free markets; for certain materials that must be exported to exchange for machinery and equipment imports, whether we should reduce our own consumption and first ensure the needs of exports to meet the needs of industrialization, or the opposite, and other similar issues, there are actually some vague understandings. There is not a full understanding of the actual measures to strengthen the leadership of the working class at the current stage and the real relationship between these measures and the interests of the peasants. In particular, some people have insufficient understanding of the new class struggle situation in the countryside in the current period and the inevitable changes that will occur in the peasants themselves, as well as the serious task of the socialist transformation of agriculture. They cannot clearly distinguish between the basic laborers and exploiters (rich peasants) in the current countryside, and regard this as two opposing forces in the current countryside, nor can they always pay attention to distinguishing between the two aspects of the working peasants themselves—laborers and private owners. They treat the issue of improving agricultural production today by departing from the struggle between the two development paths of capitalism and socialism. This insufficient understanding of the tasks of socialist transformation and class struggle in the current countryside will inevitably lead to neglecting the leading role of the working class, neglecting the various correct measures currently taken by the state that are both conducive to industrial construction and conducive to the socialist transformation of agriculture, and failing to earnestly implement the Party's class policy in the countryside in the current period.

    On the other hand, the facts of the past few years have proved that there is still a kind of blind complacency and carelessness in the issue of peasants and agricultural production. This is because it is believed that the Party and the working class enjoy extremely high prestige among the peasant masses, and our experience in dealing with the peasant issue is still "more than enough" and "sufficient to cope with everything," so we have become careless about the peasant issue. This is primarily manifested in the inability to carefully explain to the peasant masses the path guided by the Party and the various measures taken for this purpose, especially the inability to carefully explain to the peasant masses the various economic policies adopted by the Party in the current period, and the changes that will inevitably be caused in the people's economic life due to the implementation of these policies, explaining why these changes are legitimate and necessary at present, thereby regaining and consolidating the trust of the peasants, stabilizing the emotions of the peasants, and attracting the peasants to actively participate in the socialist construction. There is no doubt that our Party's policies are correct at present, but if some working peasants still express some dissatisfaction or doubt about the Party's policies under the current situation, then we should first blame ourselves for not doing enough in correctly implementing the Party's policies, not doing enough in publicity and explanation work, not caring enough about the actual life and production of these working peasants, not showing enough examples or examples sufficient to persuade the peasants, or even publicizing the correct policies in a one-sided and wrong way, and we should not blame these backward peasants. Under the current situation where production cannot keep up with needs, the main agricultural products and some of the most important daily consumer goods are subject to unified purchase and sales, and the purchasing power of the peasants is constantly improving, the position of commercial work and market work in the worker-peasant alliance is becoming increasingly important. It is, as Lenin pointed out, a link with decisive significance, and any carelessness and bureaucracy in this regard will be detrimental to the worker-peasant alliance and thus detrimental to the cause of socialist construction. For example, certain commodities are overstocked and out of stock in the countryside; certain commodities are necessary for the peasants and can be produced, but production is insufficient or the quality cannot be guaranteed, etc., all of which are sufficient to cause bad results. Unfortunately, this kind of carelessness and bureaucracy cannot be said to be isolated in various places at present. As for the mutual aid and cooperation movement, a link of decisive significance for agricultural production, various careless phenomena are also common. This is mainly manifested in insufficient real and specific guidance, insufficient guidance in economic accounting and real calculation of economic effects, and political work not keeping up, etc.

    All the above situations show that not everyone has yet practically understood the urgent task of agricultural production in the current national construction. This task is not only manifested in the fact that our agricultural production must strive for more production this year with special efforts to compensate for the losses caused by natural disasters in the past two years, but especially in order to ensure the balanced development of national economic construction and the needs of the people's lives, ensure the nourishment of heavy industry and meet the raw material needs of light industry, ensure export materials and appropriately meet their own consumption, etc. Many urgent tasks have been put forward in agricultural production. There is no other way to solve these tasks except to increase production. Judging from the current situation of agricultural production, this task cannot be easily completed. It is not as easily thought by some people that agricultural production is only important during the economic recovery period, and is not important in the current period; or that the task can be easily completed. In addition, the above situation also shows that some people have insufficient attention to the profound changes that are taking place in all aspects (especially peasants) in the current period. Due to this situation, new problems may occur between the city and the countryside, between industry and agriculture, and between the working class and the peasants at any time, and we must seek new appropriate methods to solve them at any time according to the principle of benefiting the worker-peasant alliance. Here, of course, it cannot be considered that our past little old experience and old methods are already sufficient. Lenin once said when recounting Engels' words: "...We should set an example. Before communism is fully realized, no form is the final form. We cannot presumptuously think that we know the right path." ("Report on the Attitude of the Proletariat towards the Petty-Bourgeois Democrats")

    Studying Lenin's ideology of the worker-peasant alliance and the rich experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in consolidating the worker-peasant alliance in socialist construction will help us to further consolidate China's worker-peasant alliance in various practical tasks. Whether from the needs of the entire socialist cause or from the increasingly urgent tasks of the current first five-year plan, it is very necessary to pay attention to further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance in all aspects.

    加强学习工农联盟的思想，积极推进我国社会主义建设事业
    吴江
    工人阶级同劳动农民联盟的思想，是马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级革命理论最重要的基础之一，是无产阶级专政问题的组成部分，是苏联共产党全部革命政策的基石。认真学习工农联盟的思想，对于推进我国社会主义建设事业有着极为重大的意义。
    马克思和恩格斯只是一般地指出农业资本主义发展的规律、劳动农民革命性的深厚根底，以及无产阶级为实现自己的领导权同劳动农民结成革命联盟的极端必要性。列宁在新的历史条件下发展了马克思和恩格斯关于农民问题的提示。列宁是在无产阶级必须去夺取政权争得无产阶级专政的条件下，从无产阶级同盟者问题着眼来论证这个问题，并由此建立了无产阶级领导权的严整体系。正是从这样的观点出发，列宁粉碎了西欧第二国际政党和俄国孟什维主义以及托洛茨基主义在对待农民问题上的各种各样机会主义路线。列宁根据帝国主义时代资本主义国家经济和政治发展不平衡的规律指明了：社会主义在世界资本主义体系的各环节中不可能同时成熟，资本主义的灭亡和社会主义的胜利要通过个别国家脱离资本主义体系来实现，在这些国家中，无产阶级同基本农民群众结成联盟去夺取政权，就能取得胜利。而无产阶级在这个联盟中的领导权，则是取得民主革命的胜利并使这个革命顺利过渡到社会主义革命去的必要保证。
    伟大十月社会主义革命生动地证实了列宁这一光辉的思想，俄国无产阶级同革命农民的联盟，首先突破了世界帝国主义的阵线，建立了无产阶级专政，并在世界历史上开辟了一个新纪元，社会主义胜利的纪元。
    列宁根据新的历史条件和无产阶级革命的实践经验，阐明了无产阶级专政的公式，规定了无产阶级专政是无产阶级（领导者）同农民及其他被剥削群众（被领导者）的特殊形式的阶级联盟。列宁把在推翻沙皇制度和推翻资本主义的事业中的无产阶级领导权的严整体系，扩展为在无产阶级专政时期的社会主义建设事业中对于城乡劳动群众实行领导的严整体系。列宁认为，以工人阶级为领导的旨在反对剥削阶级的工农联盟，是无产阶级专政的最高原则。只有遵循这样一个原则，才能保持住无产阶级的领导作用和国家政权，并完成无产阶级专政的任务。
    社会主义在一个国家内胜利的问题，在国内方面就是国内各阶级的相互关系问题。列宁认为无产阶级同农民的联盟，虽然是在经济上、政治上、精神上不同的阶级间的联盟，因而存在着一定的矛盾，但由于无产阶级专政的利益是与农民根本利益相一致，社会主义制度完全能够满足两者的利益，因此无产阶级能够克服自己同农民的矛盾，巩固自己同农民的联盟，并吸引农民群众参加社会主义建设。因此，无产阶级专政不但能够克服由于国家经济技术落后所造成的一切困难，而且完全能够在经济上战胜本国资产阶级，消灭剥削阶级，并建成社会主义社会。
    在由资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期，在建设社会主义的方法和道路问题上，列宁对于马克思主义的伟大贡献还在于：他从俄国这样一个小农和小生产占统治地位的国家的情况出发（列宁认为这一情况决定向社会主义过渡的形式），拟定了经济政策的具体办法，使握有经济命脉的无产阶级能运用这些具体办法把社会主义工业同农业结合起来，从而把全部国民经济引向社会主义；拟定了通过合作社把基本农民群众逐渐引上社会主义建设轨道的具体办法，认为合作社是无产阶级专政用来改造小农经济并以社会主义精神改造农民的最强有力的工具。这些包括了列宁的在苏联建成社会主义的计划的要旨。这个计划具体表现在新经济政策中。
    苏维埃政权在过渡时期所实行的新经济政策，是旨在利用市场、商业等使社会主义成分战胜资本主义成分，并建成社会主义的经济政策。这一政策的本质是工人阶级同农民的经济联盟。列宁在第九次全俄苏维埃代表大会上的报告中曾指出：“当我们致力于决定新经济政策时，我们要为它，为这个新社会制定出工农联盟的形式。”
    正是这样，苏联共产党依据列宁的在苏联建成社会主义的计划，在整个过渡时期中规划出了一条工人阶级领导农民走上社会主义的道路。这条道路就是：通过社会主义国有化掌握国民经济命脉，建立社会主义同农民经济的商业结合；实行国家的社会主义工业化，用供给农村以先进机器技术的办法建立同农村的生产结合；实行农业集体化，在农村中建立社会主义的经济基础。
    社会主义的任务是消灭剥削，消灭阶级，这是任何真正马克思主义者都容易理解的。但是，把这个问题同实际解决人数广大的小生产者中间阶层
  （主要是农民）的问题联系起来时，就变得复杂万分了。列宁的伟大功绩就在于：他对消灭剥削阶级和改造中间阶层这两个任务间的联系和在解决方法上的区别，作了深刻的科学的论证，并切实地解决了社会主义所面对着的这个最复杂任务。列宁在其社会主义建设的纲领性著作“无产阶级专政时代的经济和政治”中指出：地主和资本家是可以一举推翻的，但是改造农民、消灭工农间的差别这个任务，却不能用推翻的办法来解决。解决这个任务，是要在工农联盟的基础上把全部社会经济加以改造，使个体的、单独的小商品经济过渡到公共的大经济；在改造农民时要时刻注意分清农民作为劳动者和私有者的两个方面。作为劳动者，农民倾向于无产阶级；作为私有者，他又倾向于资产阶级。在建设社会主义过程中，无产阶级注意作为劳动者的农民的根本利益，而资产阶级则企图利用农民的私有者的利益。列宁认为，分清农民的这两个方面乃是社会主义的全部实质所在。
    因此，列宁认为，在过渡时期，党和苏维埃国家的任务，要百倍加强工人阶级在工农联盟中的领导作用，在对待农民的政策上应当一贯执行以下基本路线：依靠贫农，巩固地联合中农，同富农进行不可调和的斗争。列宁指出，任何违背这条路线的举动都将危害社会主义建设事业和工农联盟，使阶级斗争和阶级力量的实际对比有利于资产阶级而不利于工人阶级。列宁再三强调指明，工人阶级在解决自己和农民的矛盾时，应当重视农民的个人利益，“不是直接依据热忱，而是借助于伟大革命所产生的热忱，依据个人利益，依据个人兴趣，依据经济核算制”，注意使农民的个人利益同公共利益正确结合起来，并使农民的个人利益服从于公共利益。而列宁认为合作社这个形式就是足以使农民的个人利益同公共利益正确结合并使其服从于公共利益，把基本农民群众逐步纳入社会主义建设轨道的唯一正确的经济形式。
    遵循着列宁指示的苏联共产党，在自己的活动中，终于全部实现了列宁所预期的目的，即，在工农联盟的基础上消灭剥削阶级和改造广大中间阶层，建成完全的社会主义社会，并在这一基础上确立了工农联盟的新的更高级的形式——工人阶级同集体农民联盟的形式。
    列宁关于工农联盟的思想后来在斯大林的著作中，在苏联共产党的决议中得到了进一步的发展。
    列宁关于工农联盟的思想武装了各国的工人阶级和共产党。中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党领导下胜利地走过的革命道路，正是基于列宁的下述教导：在殖民地国家和以农民为其主要群众的落后国家里，工人阶级政党实行共产主义策略的主要点，是觅取工人阶级领导下的工农联盟的具体形式和具体道路，并使这一道路和业已胜利了的社会主义国家的援助结合起来，以使这些国家避免资本主义的发展阶段，而经过一定的形式过渡到社会主义去。事实正是如此。列宁的教导和列宁所期待的道路，已经在中国这个拥有六亿人口的大国里以典型的形式实现了。
    我国在新民主主义革命时期的工农联盟，是我党依据我国政治经济发展的特点，依据我国革命的性质和阶级力量的具体对比，依据毛泽东同志关于在中国具体条件下武装夺取政权必须先占乡村后取城市的理论，在工人阶级先锋队深入乡村领导农民进行长期革命战争中锻炼出来的。并且这是在同资产阶级又合作又斗争的统一战线环境中形成的（无论过去和今天工农联盟都是革命统一战线的基础力量）。这样的联盟就其形式和任务来说不能不带有自己的特点。但所有这一切当然不是证明别的，而是证明列宁关于工农联盟的思想所具有的普遍指导意义及其生动力量，证明中国共产党善于在自己所处的环境中具体掌握和运用这一列宁主义的强大武器。
    自从中华人民共和国成立以来，即中国革命由新民主主义革命转变到社会主义革命以来，我国工农联盟的力量，不是比过去削弱，而是比过去大大增强了。工人阶级领导和以工农联盟为基础，标志着我们人民民主国家的根本性质。在社会主义革命即社会主义改造时期，就要把过去的工人阶级领导农民为推翻三大敌人在中国的统治而斗争的联盟，转变为工人阶级领导农民走社会主义道路即为过渡到社会主义而斗争的联盟。由于革命性质和任务的转换，由于党在过渡时期总路线的执行，在农村中封建主义同民主主义的矛盾已为资本主义同社会主义的矛盾所代替。农民本身已开始发生变化，从经济生活不稳定的个体农民逐步变化为合作化的农民。党在改革土地制度中对待农民的政策（依靠贫雇农，团结中农，中立富农，有步骤地消灭地主阶级）已为新的政策（依靠贫农（包括原来是贫农的新中农），巩固地团结中农，限制和逐步消灭富农经济）所代替。由于以上种种情况的变化，在把民主革命阶段的工农联盟转变为社会主义革命阶段的工农联盟的过程中，在人们的认识上是存在着若干问题的。
    一方面，几年来的事实已经表明，对于在社会主义建设事业中具有决定意义的工人阶级领导权问题、作为社会主义建设的物质基础的大工业的建设问题，以及国家为了进一步加强工人阶级领导的阵地和优先推进大工业建设所采取的种种必要措施等方面的问题，不是所有的人（也包括农民在内）都完全了解的。比如，是优先发展重工业还是优先发展轻工业；在目前生产赶不上需要的情况下，对于粮食及其它一些最重要的日用消费品是实行统购统销还是继续放任自由市场的存在，对某些必须出口用以换取机器装备进口的物资，是我们自己减少消费首先保证出口需要以满足工业化需要，还是与此相反等等一类问题上，是实际上存在着一些模糊认识的。对于目前加强工人阶级领导的实际措施和这些措施同农民利益的真实关系没有充分的了解。特别是一部分人对于目前时期农村中新的阶级斗争形势和农民本身必然发生的变化，及农业的社会主义改造的严重任务认识不足。他们既不能清楚地区别目前农村中的基本劳动者和剥削者（富农），把这看作是目前农村中两种对立的势力，又不能时刻注意分清劳动农民本身的两个方面——劳动者和私有者。他们离开资本主义和社会主义两条发展道路的斗争问题来对待今天的农业生产提高的问题。这种对于目前农村中社会主义改造任务和阶级斗争任务的认识不足，势必导致忽视工人阶级的领导作用，忽视目前国家所采取的种种既有利于工业建设又有利于农业的社会主义改造的正确措施，不能认真执行目前时期党在农村中的阶级政策。
    另一方面，几年来的事实证明：在农民问题和农业生产问题上还存在一种盲目自满、漫不经心的态度。这就是以为党和工人阶级的领导在农民群众中享有极高的威信，我们在对待农民问题上的经验在现在来说也还是“绰绰有余”，“足以应付一切”，因而对农民问题粗心大意起来。这首先表现在不能够细心地向农民群众解释党所指引的道路及为此而采取的种种措施，特别是不能够细心地向农民群众解释党在目前时期所采取的各项经济政策，以及因实施这些政策在人民经济生活方面所必然引起的变化，说明这种变化在目前为什么是正当的和必要的，由此去重新争得和巩固农民的信任，安定农民的情绪，吸引农民积极参加社会主义建设事业。目前我们党的政策无疑是正确的，但在现在情况下假如说还有某些劳动农民对于党的政策依然表示某种不满或怀疑态度，那末这首先应当怪我们自己正确执行党的政策做的不够，宣传解释工作做得不够，对这些劳动农民的实际生活和生产关心不够，向农民展示的实例不多或不足以说服农民，或甚至是正确的政策做了片面的错误的宣传，而不应当去责怪这些农民落后。在目前生产赶不上需要，主要农产品和一些最重要的日用消费品实行统购统销，而农民的购买力又不断提高的情况下，商业工作和市场工作在工农联盟中的地位越来越显得重要。它正像列宁所指出的，是一个带决定意义的环节，在这方面任何一点粗心大意和官僚主义，都是不利于工农联盟，因而有损于社会主义建设事业的。例如，某些商品积压而农村脱销；某些商品为农民所必需而又可能生产，但生产不足，或质量不能保证等等，都足以招致坏的结果。可惜，这种粗心大意和官僚主义的现象在目前各地还不能说是个别的。至于在互助合作运动这样一个对农业生产具有决定意义的环节上，各种粗心大意的现象也不少见。这主要表现在真正切实的具体的指导做得不够，指导经济核算和切实计算经济效果不够，以及政治工作赶不上去等等。
    所有上述这些情况说明：目前还不是所有的人都已经切实了解农业生产在目前国家建设中的迫切任务。这个任务不仅表现在我们的农业生产在今年必须以特别大的努力来争取较多的增产，以弥补前两年自然灾害所造成的损失，尤其表现在为了保证国家经济建设的平衡发展和人民生活的需要，保证滋养重工业并满足轻工业的原料需要，保证出口物资并适当满足自己的消费等等。在农业生产方面业已提出了许多紧迫的任务。解决这些任务，除了增产别无他途。而按目前农业生产的情况看来，这个任务不是能够轻易完成的。决不像有些人所设想的那样，农业生产只是在经济恢复时期重要，在目前时期就不重要了；或者说能够轻而易举地完成任务了。此外，上面情况也说明：有些人对于目前时期各方面（尤其是农民）都在发生深刻变化的情况注意不足。由于这种情况，城市同乡村间、工业同农业间、工人阶级同农民间随时都可能发生新问题，我们必须按照有利于工农联盟的原则随时觅取新的适当办法来加以解决。这里，当然不能认为我们过去的一点点老经验和老办法已经足够了。列宁在转述恩格斯的话时曾说过：“……我们应当做出榜样来。在共产主义没有彻底实现以前，任何一种形式都不是最后的形式。我们不能妄自认为我们知道正确的道路。”（“关于无产阶级对小资产阶级民主派的态度的报告”）
    学习列宁关于工农联盟的思想和苏联共产党在社会主义建设中巩固工农联盟的丰富经验，有助于我们在各项实际工作中促进我国工农联盟的进一步巩固。无论从整个社会主义事业的需要来看，或从当前第一个五年计划的越来越显出紧迫的任务来看，从各个方面注意进一步巩固工农联盟都是十分必要的。
