Agricultural Production Cooperatives Should Inspect the Feeding of Draught Animals
    Zhong Xia

The phenomenon of draught cattle being thin and dying is very serious in the agricultural production cooperatives in Xiangyang County, Hubei Province. The 95 agricultural production cooperatives in the county (including some old cooperatives) have more than 2,000 draught cattle in total. Since the beginning of winter, 59 cattle have died, and about 500 have become sick due to cold and hunger. The death of draught cattle has a very bad impact on both cooperative members and individual farmers. Cooperative members said sadly, "If the cattle keep dying, how will we farm next year?" Individual farmers reflected, "The cooperative is good, but it's not good if the cattle keep dying." Some bad elements sarcastically said, "The cooperative is truly superior, they can afford to let cattle die!"

The reasons for the thinness and death of draught cattle are as follows:

    1. After the draught cattle joined the cooperative, no work standards were set based on the cattle's strength. Cooperative members worked overtime when using the cattle, only caring about earning more work points, regardless of the cattle's life or death. Sometimes they would take the cattle to work before they were full or had enough water. They would rush to use the big, strong cattle because they could earn more work points; they were unwilling to use the small, weak cattle because they would earn fewer work points for the same amount of work. As a result, the good and strong cattle became thin and died from exhaustion; the weak and small cattle became thin and lost weight because no one managed them.

    2. The division of labor among the cooperative committee members was not clear, and no one was specifically in charge of feeding the draught cattle. Even if some cooperative members were very conscientious about feeding the draught cattle, they could not find a place to solve problems when they arose, and gradually became passive.

    3. The cooperative had insufficient grass and fodder. Poor peasants could not afford to provide enough, and middle peasants were unwilling to provide it; when grain was purchased and sold in a unified manner, enough fodder was not uniformly set aside, and some draught cattle ran out of feed and became thin day by day.

    4. The remuneration for feeding draught cattle was unreasonable. Some cooperatives did not have collective cattle sheds and distributed the cattle to households for feeding, with one work point awarded for feeding one cow, which the feeding households considered too low. In some cooperatives, cooperative members took turns feeding the draught cattle, with one household responsible for feeding for one month; some households fed well in the first half of the month, but in the second half of the month, seeing that it was almost their turn to pass it on, they did not feed them properly.

After the working group of the CPC Prefectural Committee discovered this serious phenomenon, it cooperated with local cadres to convene a series of meetings, including joint meetings of cooperative directors, meetings of model cattle feeders, and symposiums with veteran farmers, to study the causes of cattle deaths and determine four measures to ensure the safe wintering of draught cattle: 1. Determine work standards based on the cattle's strength and the difficulty of the work; establish a system for inspecting and evaluating draught cattle to ensure they are fed well and given adequate rest. 2. Recommend cooperative committee members with feeding experience to be responsible for leading and inspecting the feeding and management of draught cattle. 3. Rationally allocate grass and fodder, and carry out some sideline production (such as opening flour mills) to ensure that the draught cattle have sufficient grass and fodder. 4. Rationally adjust work points for feeding cattle. Other specific issues were also discussed and resolved by each cooperative based on the opinions of the cooperative members.

The problem of draught cattle feeding in Xiangyang County is quite common in some poorly managed agricultural production cooperatives and in some newly established agricultural cooperatives that blindly concentrate livestock regardless of conditions and lack good feeding management. In Xing'an County, Guangxi, 204 new cooperatives have been established, and according to preliminary understanding, more than 80 cooperatives have no one managing the draught animals. Some new cooperatives in Shandong have just been set up and immediately implemented the practice of putting livestock in the same trough and pigs in the same pen, with very poor feeding management, and some have already frozen and starved to death.

The unified use of means of production by agricultural production cooperatives is originally beneficial to production. However, blindly concentrating livestock regardless of specific conditions, and after concentration, not having anyone responsible for management, not having the necessary equipment for maintaining livestock, and not having a reasonable remuneration system are all detrimental to the protection of livestock and the consolidation of cooperatives.

At present, draught animals are the most important power in agricultural production in our country. The loss of livestock is a major loss in production. Cooperatives that have already converted livestock into shares and concentrated them in the same trough should immediately check and improve the feeding management of livestock and earnestly protect draught animals. If it is indeed difficult to return to the cooperative at present, they can be fed separately with the consent of the cooperative members. All possible methods should be used to solve the problem of livestock feed. The practices of Mancheng and Laiyuan counties in Hebei, such as organizing farmers to collectively cut grass and developing transportation to "raise livestock with livestock," are all worth learning from.

    农业生产合作社应检查耕畜饲养情况
    仲夏
    湖北襄阳县农业生产合作社中的耕牛瘦弱、死亡现象十分严重。该县九十五个农业生产合作社（包括部分老社）共有耕牛二千多头，入冬以来，先后死亡五十九头，因冻、饿致病的约有五百多头。耕牛死亡对社员和个体农民的影响都很不好。社员悲痛地说：“光死牛，明年庄稼怎么做？”个体农民反映：“社是不错，就是光死牛，不好。”个别坏分子讽刺说：“社真优越，死得起牛！”
    耕牛瘦弱、死亡的原因有以下几点：
    一、耕牛入社以后，没有根据牛的体力定出耕作标准，社员使牛时加工加点，只顾多挣工分；不管耕牛死活。有时不等牛吃饱饮足就拉去用。对大牛、壮牛抢着用，因为可以多得工分；小牛、弱牛都不愿用，因为同样作工却少得工分。结果好牛、壮牛用瘦了、累死了；弱牛、小牛因为无人管理而饿瘦了，掉膘了。
    二、社务委员分工不明确，没有人专管喂养耕牛。即使有些社员对于饲养耕牛很尽心，但因出了问题找不到地方解决，慢慢也就消极了。
    三、社内草料不足，贫农摊不起，中农不愿摊；粮食统购时饲料没有统一留够，有些耕牛断了料，一天天地瘦弱了。
    四、喂养耕牛报酬不合理。有些合作社没有集体牛房，分散给各户喂养，喂一牛顶一分，喂牛户都嫌低。有的合作社的耕牛由社员轮流喂养，一户负责喂一月；有些户前半月喂的还好，后半月看到快轮出去，就不好好喂了。
    这种严重现象，经中共地委工作组检查发现以后，已协同当地干部，连续召开合作社社长联席会、喂牛模范会、老农座谈会等，研究耕牛死亡原因，确定保养耕牛安全过冬的四项办法：一、按照耕牛的体力和耕作难易，确定耕作标准；订出耕牛检查评比制度，保证喂饱喂好，并让耕牛适当休息。二、推举有饲养经验的社务委员，负责领导和检查耕牛的饲养和管理。三、合理负责草料，进行一些副业生产（如开粉房），保证耕牛草足料够。四、合理调整喂牛工分。其他具体问题，各社根据社员意见，也都讨论解决了。
    襄阳县的耕牛喂养问题，在一些经营管理不好的农业生产合作社中，在一些不顾条件盲目集中牲畜，缺乏良好的饲养管理的新建农业合作社中，相当普遍地存在着。广西兴安县新建了二百零四个社，据初步了解，有八十多个社的耕畜无人管理。山东有些新社刚搭好架子，立刻实行牲口合槽猪合圈，饲养管理很坏，有些已经冻饿而死。
    农业生产合作社统一使用生产资料，这对生产本来是有利的。但是，不顾具体条件，盲目集中牲畜，集中以后，没有专人负责管理，没有保养牲畜的应有设备和合理的报酬制度，这对牲畜的保护和合作社的巩固都是很不利的。
    在目前，耕畜是我国农业生产上最重要的动力。牲畜的损失就是生产上的重大损失。牲畜已经折价归公、集中合槽的合作社，应该立即检查和改进牲畜饲养管理情况，切实保护耕畜。如果现在归社确有困难，可经社员同意，适当分散喂养。牲畜饲料问题，要想尽各种方法加以解决。河北满城、涞源等县组织农民集体打草，开展运输“以畜养畜”，这些作法都值得学习。
