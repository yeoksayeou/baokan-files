Since the New Year, the weather in Jiangsu Province has been cold, and most waterways have been frozen, causing serious difficulties in the transfer of supplies. Various localities have taken emergency measures to transport large quantities of Spring Festival supplies to rural areas in a timely manner. Nanjing, Huaiyin, Yangzhou, Nantong and other places have organized more than 190 transport trucks to travel back and forth on the main highway lines north of the Yangtze River to transport Spring Festival supplies; Nantong Prefecture has organized more than 100 ice-breaking teams and multiple ships to break ice day and night, and the main transportation lines to various counties have been opened to navigation, and large quantities of grain are being transported to cotton-producing areas. By January 13, shipping had been restored in most parts of the province, and various localities had used wooden sailboats to transport 180,000 tons of supplies to rural areas. In Huaiyin Prefecture, all Spring Festival supplies except cottonseed oil have been transported to grassroots sales units. In Jiangdu County, more than 100 supply groups from 41 supply and marketing cooperatives are using shoulder poles and boats to transport rice, cotton cloth, matches, edible salt and other items, providing supplies everywhere they go. Many farmers said with emotion: Before liberation it was "Heavy snow is falling, firewood, rice, oil and salt are all rising in price," but now it is "Heavy snow is falling, oil, salt and rice are delivered to your home."

    破冰开路往农村赶运春节物资
    新年以来，江苏省内天气寒冷，大部航道结冰，物资调运发生了严重困难。各地采取紧急措施，及时把大量春节物资运往农村。南京、淮阴、扬州、南通等地共组织一百九十多辆运输卡车，在长江以北各公路干线上来往运送春节物资；南通专区组织了一百多个打冻组和多艘轮船日夜打冻，通往各县的主要运输线已经通航，大批粮食正运往产棉区。到一月十三日，全省大部地区已经恢复航运，各地已经用木帆船向农村运送了十八万吨物资。淮阴专区的春节供应物资除棉籽油一项外，都已全部运到基层销售单位。江都县四十一个供销合作社的一百多个供应小组，用担子和船载运着大米、棉布、火柴、食盐等物品，到处流动供应。许多农民感动地说：解放前是“大雪纷纷下，柴米油盐都涨价”，现在是“大雪纷纷下，油盐大米送到家”。
