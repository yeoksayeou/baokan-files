Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 13th: The newspaper "Pravda" published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent, Podklyuchnikov, commenting on the meeting scheduled to take place on the 14th in Baden-Baden between the French and West German Prime Ministers.

The correspondent pointed out that West German newspapers consider the Saar issue to be one of the primary issues to be discussed at the meeting. West German newspapers are now demanding concessions from Mendès France on this issue, and are threatening that – as the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" put it – otherwise "the fate of the Saar agreement in the Bundestag is uncertain."

Although many newspapers say that the Saar issue will be the first item on the agenda, it is already clear that this is not the main issue. The question of discussing Mendès France's proposal to establish a "military arms coordination agency" is gradually being given priority. This plan is supported by those French monopoly capitalists who hope to obtain some lucrative war order contracts resulting from the establishment of the West German army.

The correspondent wrote that, as can be seen from newspaper comments, this plan has not been agreed to by West German industrialists. Their mouthpiece, the "Deutsche Zeitung und Wirtschaftszeitung," said that the plan is merely "a beginning to revise the Paris Agreements according to French interests," that is, according to the interests of French monopoly capital.

Many West German newspapers are demanding that this "military arms coordination agency" be rejected and that free competition be implemented, because West German industrialists have good reason to hope that they can defeat their French counterparts in free competition.

The correspondent finally pointed out that this movement against the "military arms coordination agency" is also being incited by representatives of American monopoly capital who are involved in West German rearmament. He said: In the days before Adenauer's meeting with Mendès France, it has become very clear that serious and increasingly obvious contradictions exist between France and West Germany.
Xinhua News Agency, January 17th: According to TASS, French Prime Minister Mendès France met with Bonn Chancellor Adenauer in Baden-Baden, West Germany, on the 14th. Both Mendès France and Adenauer hoped that the outcome of this meeting would make it easier for their own national parliaments to finally ratify the Paris Agreements. Therefore, Mendès France attempted to get the Bonn government to accept his proposal to establish a so-called "military arms coordination agency." The purpose of this proposal was to spread the impression in France that West German rearmament was subject to some kind of "supervision." Adenauer, on the other hand, demanded that the wording of the Paris resolution on the Saar issue be revised in order to better conceal the fact that the Paris Agreements meant the final cession of the Saar.

The communiqué issued after the meeting and reports in the press indicate that the two prime ministers did not reach an agreement on these major issues, nor did they alleviate existing differences of opinion to any extent. For example, regarding the "military arms coordination" issue, the communiqué vaguely stated: "Regarding the issue of armaments… Federal Republic Minister of Economics Erhard has informed the French Prime Minister of the proposals that will be communicated to the other members of the future alliance." According to reports from Paris, West Germany suggested that this issue should first be discussed by a seven-nation expert meeting to be held in Paris on the 17th.

No major progress was made on the Saar issue either. The Saar Agreement remains fraught with serious differences between West Germany and France. The outcome of the meeting did not lead to the terms of the disputed Saar Agreement being interpreted according to the interests of the West German parliamentarians who oppose the Saar Agreement. It was merely decided that "it is appropriate" to hold a plebiscite in the Saar supervised by an international committee.

Another important aspect of the Baden-Baden meeting was the issue of German investment in French enterprises in mainland France and North Africa. Parisian newspapers reported that negotiations on this issue took place in a "cold atmosphere"; the French side suggested using a long period of time to "study" the possibility of German investment, while the German delegation insisted on specifying an earlier date.

American and British journalists in Baden-Baden had to admit the failure of the meeting. "New York Times" reporter Handler said that the communiqué from Mendès France and Adenauer did not seem to justify the optimistic estimates made by the two men at the press conference. The British Broadcasting Corporation's correspondent in Baden-Baden gave a similar interpretation of the meeting.

Parisian newspapers reacted very lukewarmly to the results of the Baden-Baden meeting. "Combat" said: The German delegation put forward its own draft on the "military arms coordination" plan. It opposed the idea of "supranational control" and proposed a method of "coordinating" arms production among Western European countries. "Combat" pointed out that West German manufacturers are already taking action to completely remove all restrictions on arms production and are unwilling to be "subject to foreign control, even if these countries prove to be their allies."

Referring to the discussion on the Saar issue, "Combat" pointed out that the Bonn government is still trying every possible means to drive French monopoly capital out of the Saar's economy.

"Le Monde" pointed out: We are now far from France's original "military arms coordination agency" plan. "Le Monde" said that the problems facing France and West Germany "are too complex and too difficult to be resolved in one evening."

British newspapers also pointed out that after the Baden-Baden meeting, the contradictions between France and Germany have not been resolved.

The "Sunday Times" diplomatic observer pointed out that the rather vague wording in the Franco-German communiqué proved that "the Baden-Baden meeting did nothing to facilitate a positive outcome for the vote on the Saar Agreement in the Bundestag during the second and third readings. The French side showed a cold reaction to Germany's insistence on having a 'free market' in armaments negotiations."

The "Observer's" Berlin correspondent also reported that West Germany was disappointed with the Baden-Baden communiqué because it could not ease the opposition to the Saar Agreement taken by the ruling group itself and by those outside the ruling group.

### 为什么法国总理到巴登—巴登去

    为什么法国总理到巴登—巴登去
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十三日讯：“真理报”刊载了驻柏林记者波德克留奇尼科夫的一篇电讯，评论法国和西德总理定于十四日在巴登—巴登举行的会谈。
    记者指出，西德报纸认为萨尔问题是这次会谈将讨论的首要问题之一。西德报纸现在要求孟戴斯—弗朗斯在这个问题上让步，并扬言说——像“法兰克福环球报”就这样说——如果不然“萨尔协定在联邦议院中的命运就说不定了”。
    虽然许多报纸说，萨尔问题将是这次会谈中的第一项议程，但是已经可以明显看出，这不是主要的问题。讨论孟戴斯—弗朗斯建议的建立“军备统筹机构”的计划的问题正逐渐被提到首要地位。这个计划得到那样一些法国垄断资本的支持，他们希望得到一些因建立西德军队而产生的有利可图的战争订货合同。
    记者写道，从报纸的评论可以看出，这个计划一直没有得到西德工业家的同意。他们的喉舌“德意志日报与经济报”说，这个计划只是“按照法国的利益”，也就是按照法国垄断资本的利益“来修改巴黎协定的一个开端……”
    许多西德报纸都要求拒绝这个“军备统筹机构”并且要求实行自由竞争，因为西德工业家满有理由希望在自由竞争中击败他们的法国对手们。
    记者最后指出，这种反对“军备统筹机构”的运动也是参与了西德重新武装的美国垄断资本的代表们所煽动的。他说：在阿登纳同孟戴斯—弗朗斯会谈前的这些日子已经可以十分清楚地看出，法国同西德间存在着严重的、越来越明显的矛盾。
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社讯：法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯同波恩总理阿登纳十四日在西德的巴登—巴登举行了会谈。孟戴斯—弗朗斯和阿登纳两人都希望这次会谈的结果能使他们自己国家的议会比较容易地最后批准巴黎协定，因此，孟戴斯—弗朗斯企图使波恩政府接受他的建立所谓“军备统筹机构”的建议。这个建议的目的是要在法国散布要使西德重新武装受到某种“监督”的印象。阿登纳则要求修改关于萨尔问题的巴黎决议的措辞，以便能更好地掩饰巴黎协定就意味着萨尔的最后割让这个事实。
    会谈后发表的公报以及报上发表的消息表明：这两个总理没有在这些主要的问题上达成协议或是在任何程度上减轻现存的意见分歧。例如，关于
  “军备统筹”问题，公报含糊地说：“就军备问题而言……联邦共和国经济部长艾哈德已经把将要通知未来的联盟中的其他成员国的各项建议告诉了法国总理。”据巴黎消息说，西德建议这个问题应该首先由十七日在巴黎举行的七国专家会议来讨论。
    在萨尔问题上也没有取得较大的进展，萨尔协定仍然充满着西德和法国之间的严重分歧。会谈结果并没有使得争执中的萨尔协定的条款根据反对萨尔协定的西德议员们的利益来加以解释。它仅仅决定“认为宜于”在萨尔举行由一个国际委员会监督的公民投票。
    巴登—巴登会谈的另一个重要内容是德国在法国本土和北非的法国企业中的投资问题，巴黎报纸报道，这个问题的谈判是在“冷冰冰的气氛”中进行的；法国方面建议用一段很长的时间来“研究”德国投资的可能性，而德国代表团坚决要求规定较早的日期。
    巴登—巴登的美英记者不得不承认会谈的失败。“纽约时报”记者汉德勒说，孟戴斯—弗朗斯和阿登纳的公报，似乎并不能证明他们两人在记者招待会上所作的乐观估计是有理由的。英国广播公司驻巴登—巴登的记者对会谈的解释也是如此。
    巴黎报纸对于巴登—巴登会谈结果的反应很不热烈。“战斗报”说：德国代表团就“军备统筹”计划提出了它自己的草案。它反对“超国家管制”的主张，并且提出了西欧国家“统筹”军备生产的方法。“战斗报”指出，西德制造商已经在进行活动，想把对军火生产的一切限制完全取消，并且不愿意“受外国的控制，即使这些国家证明是他们的盟国”。
    “战斗报”在谈到关于萨尔问题的讨论时指出，波恩政府仍然在千方百计想把法国垄断资本从萨尔的经济中赶出去。
    “世界报”指出：我们现在离法国原来的“军备统筹机构”计划还远得很。“世界报”说，法国和西德面临的问题“是太复杂、太困难了，因而不能在一个晚上取得解决”。
    英国报纸也指出，巴登—巴登会谈以后，法德之间的矛盾仍然没有得到解决。
    “星期日泰晤士报”外交观察家指出，法德公报中的相当模糊不清的措词证明了，“巴登—巴登的会谈丝毫不能促使波恩议院在二读和三读的时候就萨尔协定举行的投票有良好的结果。法国方面对德国坚持要求在军备方面要有‘自由市场’的谈判表示冷淡。”
    “观察家报”驻柏林记者也报道说，西德对巴登—巴登的公报感到失望，因为这一公报不能够缓和政府集团本身和政府集团以外的人士对萨尔协定所采取的反对态度。
