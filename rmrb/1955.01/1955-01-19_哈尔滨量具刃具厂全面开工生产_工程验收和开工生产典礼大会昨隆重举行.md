Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 18th. China's first newly built precision machine tool manufacturing plant—the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant—held a grand project acceptance and inauguration ceremony today.

At the meeting, Liu Qisheng, chairman of the acceptance committee appointed by the government, announced: The Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant, after acceptance by the acceptance committee, meets the design standards and officially commences full-scale production today.

Li Yu, Vice Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building, spoke at the meeting. He said: The Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant is one of the key projects aided by the Soviet Union in our country's construction. The completion of this plant once again vividly illustrates the sincere and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union to our country. On behalf of the First Ministry of Machine Building, he expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet government and Soviet experts. Li Yu said: We can see the level of the entire machine manufacturing industry from a country's tool manufacturing industry. Without a modern-scale tool industry, it would be impossible to build an independent and powerful machine manufacturing industry. The completion of the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant means that from today onwards, our country can manufacture precision tools ourselves. This will further promote the development of our country's machine manufacturing industry, while also laying a foundation for our country's emerging tool industry and setting an example. Li Yu requested the workers to master new technologies with new ideas and new styles, and to achieve greater success on the production front.

Foreign guests who spoke at the meeting included Kardin, the leader of the Soviet expert working group stationed at the plant, Chukanov, the plenipotentiary representative of the Soviet Machine Tool Manufacturing and Tool Industry Ministry in our country, Baranov, the Soviet Consul General in Harbin, and Shaloyov, the representative of the Harbin branch of the Soviet Trade Representative Office in China. They all expressed their congratulations on the completion of the factory. In his speech, Chukanov hoped that the factory's employees could fully master the production technology of this new factory in the shortest possible time and wished them victory in production.

At the meeting, Qiang Xiaochu, Deputy Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Lin Xiaoxia, Deputy Secretary of the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Ma Peixun, Vice Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the First National Machinery Workers' Union of China, also spoke.

Dong Guoliang, the representative of the basic construction workers of the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant, and Yu Dexiu, the representative of the factory's production workers, both stated at the meeting that they would continue to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, continuously master new technologies, overcome difficulties, and dedicate all their strength to the great construction cause of the motherland.

At the meeting, Li Yu, on behalf of the First Ministry of Machine Building, presented commemorative medals to the foreign guests and Soviet experts stationed at the plant. Wang Guanchao, Director of the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant, presented the Soviet experts stationed at the plant with gifts of precisely made measuring and cutting tools newly trial-produced by the workers, along with letters of gratitude.

The meeting concluded with the reading of a salute telegram to Chairman Mao.

At 2:00 p.m., the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant held a ribbon-cutting ceremony. Vice Minister Li Yu cut the ribbon. This newly built precision machine tool manufacturing plant in our country has officially started production from now on.
