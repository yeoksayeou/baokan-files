Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd:

    The Chinese government's announcement of humanitarian measures to provide convenience to families of convicted and those under investigation American personnel to visit them has delighted the families of the concerned American personnel. However, the U.S. government has adopted a callous attitude, trying to prevent these families from coming to China to meet their relatives.

    According to American news agencies, Mrs. Henry Stidtfelt, mother of Elmer Fred Llewellyn, an American personnel sentenced for flying over the Chinese border to engage in espionage activities, said that the news was "simply wonderful" after the above decision was announced. She said that as long as she has the money, she will come to China as soon as possible. The parents of Harold Edward Fischer, an American personnel whose military plane was shot down after intruding into our country's borders, were also "extremely happy" upon hearing the news and said they would leave as soon as arrangements were made. Mrs. Fischer said: "We believe that the Chinese notification is completely sincere, and I am not afraid to go at all." The wives of two other American spies, Brown and Arnold, also expressed their willingness to come to China with other family members to visit their relatives. Some other American personnel's families are worried about not being able to raise enough travel expenses.

    However, instead of considering the wishes of these families and providing them with convenience, the U.S. authorities have been making things difficult in various ways. The U.S. Department of Defense and the Air Force authorities sent telegrams to the families of the relevant personnel in a threatening tone, saying that if they decide to come to China, the U.S. government cannot provide them with convenience and protection, and they must "bear the risk of this trip" themselves. A U.S. State Department spokesman also stated on the 21st that "the U.S. government cannot in good conscience encourage those who may wish to go" to China. A United Press reporter said: "The State Department hopes to dissuade these families from going."

    This practice of the U.S. authorities is no accident. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles issued a statement after meeting with Hammarskjöld on the 19th, saying that regarding China's sentencing of American spies to imprisonment, "there is a strong sentiment in the United States in favor of taking direct action." Dulles also threatened to "await further developments in this matter." These actions by the U.S. authorities show that they are not genuinely concerned about the convicted American personnel, but are rather making trouble without reason and creating a tense atmosphere to cover up their acts of aggression against China.

    被判罪的美国人员家属想来我国探望
    美国政府却设法阻挠他们和亲人会面
    【新华社二十三日讯】中国政府准备提供便利，使已被判罪的和正在审查中的美国人员的家属得以前来探访的人道措施公布以后，使上述有关美国人员的家属们喜出望外。但是美国政府却采取冷酷的态度，设法阻挠这些家属前来中国和他们的亲人会面。
    据美国通讯社报道，因乘飞机偷越中国国境从事间谍活动而被判刑的美国人员埃尔默·弗雷德·刘维林的母亲亨利·斯迪特夫人在上述决定公布后说，这个消息“简直太好了”。她说只要她有钱，她一定尽快到中国来。驾驶军用飞机侵入我国国境被击落的美国人员哈罗德·爱德华·费希尔的父母听到这个消息也“高兴得不得了”，并表示一等到安排停妥就动身。费希尔夫人说：“我们相信中国的通知是完全有诚意的，我根本不怕前去。”另外两个美国间谍人员布朗和阿诺德的妻子也表示愿意和其他家属一道到中国来探望她们的亲人。还有一些美国人员的家属担心筹不到足够的路费。
    但是，美国官方不但不考虑这些家属的愿望，为他们提供便利，反而多方作难。美国国防部和空军当局在发给有关人员的家属的电报中用恫吓的口吻说，如果他们决定来中国，美国政府不能为他们提供便利和保护，他们必须自己“担当这种旅行的风险”。美国国务院发言人二十一日也表示“美国政府不能心安理得地鼓励可能希望去的人”到中国去。合众社记者说：“国务院希望能够打消这些家属前去的念头”。
    美国当局这种作法并非偶然。美国国务卿杜勒斯在十九日和哈马舍尔德会谈后曾发表声明，说什么关于中国判处美国间谍徒刑一事，“美国国内有强烈的情绪，主张采取直接行动”。杜勒斯还威胁说“等待着这个问题的进一步的发展”。美国当局这些作为，表明它并非真正关心已被判罪的美国人员，而是无理取闹，制造紧张空气，以掩护它对中国的侵略行为。
