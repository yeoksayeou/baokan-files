    Resolutely Crush the US-Chiang Treaty, We Must Liberate Taiwan

    Strive to Improve Modern Combat Technology to Firmly Complete the Sacred Task of Liberating Taiwan

    Combat Heroes of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Zhang Ming, Wei Laiguo, Model Workers Li Landing, Chen Yan jointly wrote: The so-called "common defense treaty" signed by the US government and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is a serious war provocation by the American aggressors against the Chinese people. This provocative act has aroused our great anger and further strengthened our determination to fight for the liberation of Taiwan. In the past few months, all commanders and fighters of our East China People's Armed Forces have actively strengthened all aspects of their work, preparing to undertake the historical task of liberating Taiwan. From September to the end of November 1954, our army has achieved brilliant results in the battle against the enemy on the Fujian and Zhejiang fronts, shooting down and damaging 100 Chiang bandits' planes and sinking and damaging 8 Chiang bandits' warships. Our army also continuously bombed and shelled the Chiang bandit military positions on islands such as Great and Little Kinmen, Dachen, Pishan, Yijiangshan, and Yushan, giving the Chiang bandit army a heavy blow. Our coastal defense and border defense troops vigilantly guard the gate of the motherland, constantly annihilating Chiang bandit armed agents who attempt to sneak into the mainland. In the training troops, the soldiers, under the slogan of "One more skill, one more guarantee of victory," are not afraid of the cold weather, day and night hard study and hard training, and strive to improve modern combat technology. Logistics staff are also working hard in their respective positions, dedicating their strength to the liberation of Taiwan. We firmly believe that with the joint efforts of the people of the whole country and the sympathy and support of the world's peace forces, we will surely successfully complete the sacred task of liberating Taiwan.

    We are combat heroes and model workers of the People's Liberation Army. In the great struggle to liberate Taiwan, we are determined to strive to create new achievements and make more contributions to the motherland and the people, and we will never live up to the lofty honor given to us by the people of the motherland.

    Smelt More Good Steel, Repair More Locomotives, Liberate Taiwan and Eliminate Chiang Bandits

    Li Shouheng from Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory wrote: Our factory held a general meeting of all employees on December 25 to oppose the US-Chiang treaty and resolutely liberate Taiwan. Beijing model worker and steelmaking foreman Liu Guanglu said at the meeting: "In order to support the liberation of Taiwan, I want to smelt more good steel, accumulate wealth for the country, and ensure that we have people and things when needed." He Fengting, an old worker of the "February 7th" said: "Taiwan is Chinese territory, and we must liberate Taiwan. In the 'February 7th' struggle, we seized the enemy's guns empty-handed and were not intimidated by the enemy. Today our strength is even greater, and the US-Chiang war provocations can only arouse our greater hatred." Young worker Yuan Fengru said: "The US-Chiang war treaty cannot shake our will to liberate Taiwan in the slightest. I guarantee to unite with the group workers, strengthen our work, improve our skills, and strive to repair more locomotives to support the liberation of Taiwan."

    Use Practical Actions of Over-fulfilling Tasks to Repay the Provocations of American Aggressors

    All the staff of Kuduer Transportation Section, Yakeshi Engineering Branch, Harbin Railway Administration wrote: After we saw the news in the newspaper that the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group had signed the so-called "common defense treaty," we all expressed unparalleled anger. We resolutely oppose this aggressive war treaty between the United States and Chiang Kai-shek, and we are determined to retaliate against it with practical actions. Our branch has completed the entire year's loading task for 1954 ten days ahead of schedule on December 20, 1954. We guarantee that by the end of 1954, we will load 500 more cars of goods to support economic construction in various places and support the struggle to liberate Taiwan.

    Do a Good Job in Mutual Aid and Cooperation, Produce More Grain, and Support the Great Struggle to Liberate Taiwan

    Gao Fengzhi, Special Class Agricultural Labor Model of Heilongjiang Province and Secretary of the Liuhe Village Branch of the Communist Party of China in Suihua County wrote: After the autumn harvest, all the farmers in our Liuhe Village actively selected the best grain for public grain. Later, after hearing Foreign Minister Zhou's statement on the US-Chiang "common defense treaty," our enthusiasm for supporting the liberation of Taiwan became even greater. The farmers automatically sold 391,900 catties of surplus grain to the state. In addition, they also sold more than 9,000 catties of seed kernels and 23 fat pigs to the state. They also deposited 38 million yuan from selling surplus grain into the National Bank. At present, we are concentrating our efforts on consolidating and improving mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and ensuring the completion of the village's 130 million yuan sideline production plan, preparing for the spring plowing production in 1955, and striving to produce more grain to support the country's socialist industrialization and support the struggle to liberate Taiwan.

    Intensify Study and Exercise, Determined to Fight for the Liberation of Taiwan

    All students of Class 4, Grade 2, Rolling Steel Specialty, Department of Technology, Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel wrote: Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement on the US-Chiang "common defense treaty" thoroughly exposed the evil deeds of the US and Chiang Kai-shek, and once again solemnly demonstrated to the world the Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan and their will to oppose aggression and defend peace. We resolutely support this solemn statement. Taiwan is our territory, the people of Taiwan are our compatriots, and the youth of Taiwan are our brothers and sisters. We live in a peaceful and happy environment, but we will never forget the disasters of the Taiwan compatriots under the dark rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group. We are determined to turn anger into strength, study hard at our posts, study diligently, firmly grasp knowledge, actively participate in the Labor Defense System exercise, and constantly improve our vigilance, pay attention to the enemy's conspiracies and activities, and work with the people of the whole country to crush the US-Chiang treaty, liberate Taiwan, and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group!

    坚决粉碎美蒋条约，一定要解放台湾
    努力提高现代化作战技术坚决完成解放台湾的神圣任务
    中国人民解放军战斗英雄张明、魏来国，模范工作者李蓝丁、陈炎联名来信：美国政府同蒋介石卖国集团签订的所谓“共同防御条约”，是美国侵略者对中国人民的严重战争挑衅。这一挑衅行为激起了我们的极大愤怒，并进一步增强了我们为解放台湾而斗争的决心。几个月来，我们华东人民武装部队的全体指战员已经积极地加强了各方面的工作，准备担当解放台湾的历史任务。从一九五四年九月到十一月底，我军在福建、浙江前线的对敌作战中，已获得击落击伤蒋贼飞机一百架、击沉击伤蒋贼军舰艇八艘的辉煌战果。我军并连续轰炸和炮击大小金门、大陈、披山、一江山、渔山等岛屿上的蒋贼军阵地，给予蒋贼军沉重的打击。我们的海防边防部队，警惕地守卫着祖国的大门，不断地歼灭妄图潜入大陆的蒋贼武装特务。正在进行训练的部队，战士们在“多一分本领，就多一分胜利保证”的口号下，不怕天寒地冻，日夜勤学苦练，努力提高现代化的作战技术。后勤工作人员们也都在各自的岗位上紧张地工作，为解放台湾献出自己的力量。我们深信，在全国人民的共同努力下，在全世界和平力量的同情和支持下，我们一定能够胜利完成解放台湾的神圣任务。
    我们是人民解放军的战斗英雄、模范工作者，在解放台湾的伟大斗争中，我们决心努力创造新的功绩，为祖国、为人民作出更多的贡献，决不辜负祖国人民给予我们的崇高荣誉。

    搞好互助合作多打粮食支援解放台湾的伟大斗争
    黑龙江省特等农业劳动模范、中共绥化县六合村支部书记高凤志来信：我们六合村全体农民在去年秋收打场后，就积极挑选最好的粮食做公粮。后来，听到周外长发表了关于美蒋“共同防御条约”的声明，我们支援解放台湾的劲头更大了。农民们又自动地把三十九万一千九百斤余粮卖给国家。此外，还卖给国家九千多斤籽仁，二十三口肥猪。又把卖余粮的钱三千八百万元储入国家银行。当前，我们正集中力量巩固和提高互助合作组织，并保证完成全村一亿三千万元的副业生产计划，做好一九五五年春耕生产的准备工作，争取打更多的粮食，以支援国家的社会主义工业化事业，支援解放台湾的斗争。
    加紧学习和锻炼身体决心为解放台湾而斗争
    北京钢铁学院工艺系轧钢专业二年级四班全体同学来信：周恩来外长关于美蒋“共同防御条约”的声明，彻底揭露了美蒋的罪恶勾当，再一次郑重地向全世界表明了中国人民解放台湾的决心和反对侵略、保卫和平的意志。我们坚决拥护这一严正的声明。台湾是我国的领土，台湾人民是我们的同胞，台湾的青年是我们的兄弟姊妹，我们生活在和平幸福的环境里，但决不会忘记台湾同胞在蒋介石卖国集团黑暗统治下的灾难。我们决心化愤怒为力量，在自己的岗位上努力学习，刻苦钻研，牢固地掌握知识，积极地参加劳动卫国制的锻炼，并时刻地提高警惕，注视敌人的阴谋活动，和全国人民一道，为粉碎美蒋条约、解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团而斗争！
