(Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, December 30th, TASS dispatch) The Yugoslav newspaper "Borba" published an abstract of the report made by Vukmanovic, Vice Chairman of the Federal Executive Council of Yugoslavia, at the session of the Yugoslav National Assembly on the draft general plan of Yugoslavia for 1955.

At the beginning of his report, Vukmanovic pointed out the increase in industrial production in 1954, as well as the increase in industrial product exports that year. Compared with 1953, the trade deficit decreased by about 40 percent, and the payment deficit decreased by 8 percent.

Vukmanovic also spoke about the unfavorable phenomena existing in Yugoslavia's economy in 1954. He said that in the first half of 1954, the wholesale prices of industrial products had increased somewhat, and retail prices had also increased. In the second half of the year, wholesale prices did not change, while the retail prices of industrial products (such as textiles and leather) tended to increase further.

Vukmanovic also said that a large part of the national income was used for national defense – from 16.2 percent to 18.5 percent.

When talking about Yugoslavia's payment deficit, he pointed out that Yugoslavia's foreign debt occupied a fairly important position in the problem of the payment deficit (the total foreign debt owed to the United States, Britain, and France was about 400 million US dollars).

The difficulty lies not only in the amount of these debts but also in the very unfavorable situation of all the debts. In the total amount of debt, long-term debt accounts for 39 percent, medium-term debt accounts for 43 percent, and short-term debt accounts for 18 percent.

Each year, the repayment of foreign debt consumes 25 percent of the income from exports. The interest on this foreign debt alone amounts to about 76.6 million US dollars, which is almost equivalent to 20 percent of Yugoslavia's foreign debt.

Vukmanovic continued, in the second half of 1954, at the initiative of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and East Germany, Yugoslavia resumed trade with these countries, which had been interrupted for many years. He also said that the resumption of normal trade relations with these countries is a particularly important factor in further expanding our foreign trade and restoring normal relations with the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries.

Vukmanovic's report also said that the living standards of Yugoslav residents are not satisfactory. The main reasons for the deterioration of people's living conditions are: low production levels and labor productivity; the tense world political situation (which makes it necessary for the country to consolidate its national defense with greater efforts); difficulties caused by the overall backwardness of agriculture and years of poor harvests, and the particular difficulties caused by the country's deficit in income and expenditure.

Vukmanovic concluded his report by talking about the issue of basic construction.

### 南斯拉夫联邦执行委员会副主席伏克曼诺维奇  谈南斯拉夫国内的经济情况和人民生活

    南斯拉夫联邦执行委员会副主席伏克曼诺维奇
    谈南斯拉夫国内的经济情况和人民生活
    【新华社讯】塔斯社贝尔格莱德一九五四年十二月三十日电：南斯拉夫“战斗报”摘要刊载了南斯拉夫联邦执行委员会副主席伏克曼诺维奇在南斯拉夫国民议会会议上作的关于一九五五年南斯拉夫总计划草案的报告。
    伏克曼诺维奇在报告开始时，指出了一九五四年工业生产量的增加，以及这一年工业品输出的增加。和一九五三年相比，贸易入超减少约百分之四十，支付逆差减少了百分之八。
    伏克曼诺维奇还讲到一九五四年南斯拉夫经济上存在的不利的现象。他说，在一九五四年上半年，工业品的批发价格有了一些上涨，零售价格也上涨了。在下半年，批发价格没有改变，而工业品（纺织品和皮革等）的零售价格有进一步上涨的趋势。
    伏克曼诺维奇还说，国民收入的很大一部分用在国防上面——从百分之十六点二到百分之十八点五。
    他讲到南斯拉夫支付逆差时指出，南斯拉夫的外债在支付逆差的问题中占相当重要的地位（欠美国、英国和法国的外债总数约四亿美元）。
    困难不仅在于这些债务的数量，而且在于全部债务的情况非常不利。在债务总数中，长期债务占百分之三十九，中期债务占百分之四十三，短期债务占百分之十八。
    每年偿付外债，就消耗了从出口所得收入款项的百分之二十五。这种外债的利息就约有七千六百六十万美元，差不多相当于南斯拉夫外债数目的百分之二十。
    伏克曼诺维奇继续说，一九五四年下半年，在苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、保加利亚和东德的倡议下，南斯拉夫和这些国家恢复了曾经中断多年的贸易。他并说，和这些国家恢复正常贸易关系，对于进一步扩大我们的对外贸易以及使我们同苏联和其他东欧国家恢复正常关系的事务，是一个特别重要的因素。
    伏克曼诺维奇的报告还说，南斯拉夫居民的生活水平是不能使人满意的。人民生活条件恶化的主要原因有：生产水平和劳动生产率低；世界政治局势紧张（这种局势使国家有必要以更大的努力来巩固国防力量）；农业上由于整个的落后性和多年歉收所造成的困难，以及国家收支逆差所造成的特别困难。
    伏克曼诺维奇在报告的最后讲到基本建设的问题。
