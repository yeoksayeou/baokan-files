    Moving the Vineyard
    To the Editor:

    In 1950, the Da Lai County Aquatic Products Company in Heilongjiang Province began experimenting with growing grapes in the cold north. Why was an aquatic products company studying this issue? It is said that the company's manager, Jia Rongshu, had previously worked in agriculture and was very interested in growing grapes. Under the manager's initiative and the employees' diligent research and careful management, the grapes blossomed and bore fruit in 1952. Moreover, the yield increased year by year. In 1953, the yield was about 700 jin of grapes, and in 1954, nearly 2,000 jin were harvested, with the highest yield per plant reaching 140 jin. The Da Lai Aquatic Products Company opened up a path for grape cultivation in cold regions. Not only were the employees of this company happy, but agricultural institutions in the central and northern parts of Northeast China were also very pleased. After learning the good news, the Northeast Agricultural Science Research Institute, the Qiqihar Horticultural Experiment Farm, and the Suiling Horticultural Experiment Farm sent people to study the matter, hoping to develop successful experience on this basis so that they could propagate grapes on a large scale in the future, so that people living in the cold north could also eat sweet and delicious grapes.

    Unexpectedly, in October 1954, when the Northeast Agricultural Science Research Institute sent people to the Da Lai Aquatic Products Company to continue their research, they could not even find a trace of the grapes. It turned out that after the provincial area adjustment, Da Lai County was transferred from Heilongjiang Province to Jilin Province. Manager Jia Rongshu was transferred back to the Aquatic Products Bureau of the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Agriculture. Manager Jia was unwilling to hand over the grapes to Jilin Province, so he "took the grapes with him," and dug up all the hundreds of grape plants that had been successfully cultivated by the Da Lai County Aquatic Products Company, and transplanted them to the Tai Kang Fishing Farm in Heilongjiang Province.

    What kind of behavior and thinking is this? I hope Comrade Jia Rongshu can examine himself!

### 葡萄园搬家

    葡萄园搬家编辑同志：
    一九五○年，原黑龙江省大赉县水产公司开始试验在寒冷的北方栽培葡萄。为什么水产公司又研究起这个问题来了呢？据说，这个公司的经理贾荣澍过去搞过农业方面的工作，对种植葡萄有很大的兴趣。在经理的倡导和职工们努力钻研、细心管理下，一九五二年葡萄就开花结果了。而且产量逐年上升，一九五三年产了葡萄约七百斤，一九五四年收了近两千斤，单株最高产量达一百四十斤。大赉水产公司给寒冷地带栽培葡萄开辟了道路，不仅这个公司里的职工高兴，就是东北中北部的农业机关也非常高兴，东北农业科学研究所、齐齐哈尔园艺试验场、绥棱园艺试验场等知道这个喜讯后，都派人去研究，希望能够在这个基础上，研究出成功的经验，以便将来能够大量繁殖，使生活在寒冷的北方的人们，也能够吃到香甜可口的葡萄。
    不料，一九五四年十月东北农业科学研究所派人到大赉水产公司去继续研究时，竟连葡萄的影子也找不到了。原来，省区调整以后，大赉县由黑龙江省划归吉林省，贾荣澍经理调回黑龙江省农业厅水产局工作，贾经理不愿将葡萄交给吉林省，就来个“葡萄随人走”，把大赉县水产公司栽培成功的数百棵葡萄全部刨走，移栽到黑龙江省泰康渔场去了。
    这是一种什么作法、什么思想呢？希望贾荣澍同志能够检查一下！  吉林白城子农业试验场刘义生
