    China Red Cross Issues Notice on Continuing to Assist Japanese Nationals Returning Home
    [This newspaper report] The China Red Cross issued a notice on January 11 regarding the continued assistance to Japanese nationals in China who wish to return to their country. The full text of the notice is as follows:
    Entrusted by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, the China Red Cross has assisted nearly 27,000 Japanese nationals in returning to their country since 1953. Considering that there are still some Japanese nationals remaining in our country who have applied to return home, the Society, based on the results of consultations between the Society's delegation to Japan and the three organizations, namely the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japan-China Friendship Association, and the Japan Peace Liaison Council, in Tokyo, has telegraphed the three organizations on January 11 to continue sending ships in February 1955. The Society hopes that all Japanese nationals who wish to return home will promptly apply to the local foreign affairs management authorities so that, after completing the departure formalities, the Society can assist them in returning home. This is hereby notified.
