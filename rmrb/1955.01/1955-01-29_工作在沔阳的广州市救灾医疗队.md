    In mid-January, this reporter met with the Guangzhou City medical team in Mianyang County, Hubei Province, four months after their arrival. Just two days prior, this medical team had escorted the last group of migrant workers from the No. 5 Zhijiao dike construction site on the Han River. On the evening of their arrival in Mianyang, the county's Party and government leaders held a celebration and farewell for them, presenting the medical team with four silk banners representing the respect of the county's 730,000 people.

    Last August, this medical team came to Mianyang County, Hubei Province, from Guangzhou City, which had suffered severe flooding. The entire team consisted of ten people, with the exception of the team leader and the inspector who were two male comrades, the rest were young women around twenty years old who had just left school. For the first two months, they worked alongside local and other outside medical teams in Xiantao Town, Mianyang County, on the south bank of the Han River, caring for farmers returning home or passing through. At that time, many sailboats and steamers continuously brought batches of farmers here. As soon as the boats docked, they treated them like long-separated relatives, helping the elderly and weak farmers off the boats and ashore, helping farmers carry things, holding children, and arranging accommodation; then they diagnosed and changed medicines for sick farmers, serving tea and meals. One day, a steamer brought an old woman suffering from severe dysentery. Her serious condition and the long journey had left her unable to move. Mai Kunwei, a nurse from the medical team, saw this situation and immediately carried her to the dike and sent her to the shelter one or two li away from the dock. After she settled the old woman, she brought a basin of water to comb her hair, wash her face, and bathe her. The old woman shed tears of gratitude, held her hand tightly, and only said one sentence for a long time: You are even closer than my own relatives!

    After the farmers returned home, the government implemented work-for-relief programs, mobilizing farmers to repair the dikes. The medical team then followed the migrant workers of Mianyang County to the No. 5 Zhijiao Dike on the Han River to repair the dikes and plug the breaches. The medical equipment and hygiene facilities at the construction site were relatively poor, so they found ways and tricks to start working in a simple manner. Chen Baoying, a young member of the Youth League and a physician in the outpatient department, and nurses Mai Kunwei, Wei Minqin, and Yu Qiyun, etc., used bamboo to make tubes for storing ointments and pills, and knives for spreading medicine during their breaks, solving the difficulty of insufficient magnetic bottles and metal knives; when there were not enough glass bottles for holding medicinal water, they carefully kept the used small glass bottles of injections, disinfected them and used them as substitutes; there were no tables in the ward, so nurses Ye Xiuli and Hong Yuping became bricklayers and built fifteen bedside tables next to all fifteen beds in the room with clay bricks.

    In late November, cold waves hit the construction site one after another, and wind and snow brought difficulties to their work and life. Their faces, hands, and feet were swollen with frostbite, and many people also suffered from colds. But they breathed on their hands or rubbed their hands, and then continued to work; those who had colds also insisted on working. They encouraged each other: What is this compared to the Red Army crossing the snow-capped mountains and sleeping on the grasslands; what is it compared to the volunteer soldiers and the People's Liberation Army on the front lines! In the severe cold, thanks to their joint efforts with other brother medical team members, the health of more than 25,000 migrant workers on the dike was protected. The dike project was completed on schedule.

    At the commendation and model recognition conference after the flood prevention in Mianyang County, Mai Kunwei, a nurse from this medical team, was named a flood prevention model worker, and team leader Wu Zhongjiang and team members Ye Xiuli, Pan Bangmin, and Chen Baoying were named flood prevention heroes. The remaining team members also received commendations.

    工作在沔阳的广州市救灾医疗队
    新华社记者　蔡蔚生
    一月中旬，记者在沔阳县会见了四月前远道而来的广州市医疗队。两天前，这支医疗队才由汉水五支角堤防工地护送完最后一班民工。在到达沔阳的当晚，沔阳县的党政领导机关为他们庆功、送别，并把代表着全县七十三万人民敬意的四面锦旗赠给了医疗队。
    去年八月间，这支医疗队由广州市来到了湖北省遭受水灾较重的沔阳县。全队十个人，除了队长、检验员是两个男同志，其余的都是刚出学校门不久的二十岁左右的年轻姑娘。起初两个月，他们跟当地和其他外地来的医疗队一道，在汉水南岸的沔阳县仙桃镇护理还乡过路的农民。那时候，每天很多帆船和轮船不断地把成批的农民送到这里。船一靠岸，他们就像接待自己久别的亲人一样，搀扶着老弱农民下船上岸，帮助农民背东西，抱小孩，安置住宿；然后又为患病的农民诊病换药，端茶送饭。一天，轮船载来了一位患着重痢疾的老婆婆，严重的病情和长途的跋涉，已使她动弹不得。医疗队的护士麦坤伟看到这种情况，就立刻把她背到堤上，送她到离码头一、二里远的收容所。她把老婆婆安置好以后，又端来一盆水给老婆婆梳头、洗脸、洗澡，老婆婆流下感激的泪，紧紧地握住她的手，半天只说出一句话：你，真比我的亲人还亲啊！
    农民还乡以后，政府实行了以工代赈，发动农民去修堤，医疗队又随沔阳县修堤堵口的民工上了汉水五支角大堤。工地上医疗器材和卫生设备比较差，他们就想办法，找窍门，因陋就简地动手工作。门诊部医师青年团员陈宝英和护士麦坤伟、卫敏勤、余琦云等几人，就在休息时间用竹子做成装药膏和药片的筒子和抹药的刀子，解决了磁瓶、金属刀不足的困难；盛药水的玻璃瓶不够，她们就把用过的针剂小玻璃瓶细心地保留起来，消毒后当代用品；病房里没有桌子，护士叶秀丽和洪玉屏就当起泥瓦匠来，用土砖在全房十五张床旁砌了十五个床头桌。
    十一月下旬，寒潮接连袭到工地，风雪给他们的工作和生活带来了困难，他们的脸、手和脚都冻肿了，不少人还患了感冒。但是他们用嘴呵一呵手，或搓一搓手，又接着干下去；患感冒的人也坚持工作。他们互相鼓励着：这比起红军过雪山、睡草地；比起志愿军和在前线的人民解放军来又算得了什么！在严寒中，由于他们和其他兄弟医疗队人员的共同努力，保护了堤上两万五千多民工的健康。堤防工程按期完成了。
    在这次沔阳县防汛后的评功表模大会上，这个医疗队的护士麦坤伟被评为防汛模范，队长吴仲江和队员叶秀丽、潘邦敏、陈宝英等人被评为防汛功臣，其余队员也受到了表扬。
