"Collective Housing"
    Ren Min Pu Wen
    Late at night on October 4th last year, the masses of Luzhou Township, Fifth District, Echeng, Hubei, were awakened from their sleep to attend an “emergency meeting.” The waning crescent moon struggling above the horizon shone weakly on the listless masses, rubbing their eyes. District cadre Zhu Linbao and Luzhou Township Party Branch Deputy Secretary Xu Yunxiang were exhausted, having spent the entire day in the district attending a mutual aid and cooperation production disaster relief representative meeting. They were instructed by the district committee after the meeting to rush to the Eighth Electoral District of Luzhou Township that very night to mobilize the masses to build "collective housing," because part of the district had suffered from flooding the previous year, and the homes of many people were destroyed. The leadership decided to rebuild homes for the disaster victims.

    The district committee's instructions were very urgent, stipulating that the "collective housing" must be built within three days, and that it must be carried out completely in accordance with the district committee's construction plan for building "collective housing." This plan was: to build two rows of bedrooms facing each other, all of the same size, with a row of kitchens on either side in front of the bedrooms, with a garden in the middle, and a row of cattle pens, pigsties, chicken coops, and duck sheds in front of that, with a meeting room in the middle, and a warehouse next to it, and so on. After the district's mutual aid and cooperation production disaster relief representative meeting, representatives would be organized to come and visit, and then this experience would be promoted throughout the district. Therefore, although Zhu Linbao and Xu Yunxiang felt their eyelids were heavy at this time, they still had to force themselves to cheer up and get to work.

    Standing at a high point, Zhu Linbao shouted at the top of his lungs: “The district committee has decided that we must practice socialism, and build collective housing together….” He then relayed what District Committee Secretary Liao Jingming had said during the day to the masses: “Rebuilding homes is not easy, materials and manpower are difficult to find everywhere. Only by building ‘collective housing’ can we overcome these difficulties.”

    “The houses must be built in three days,” Xu Yunxiang continued after Zhu Linbao said: “Everyone should take out their materials. All houses within 50 meters of the embankment must be demolished, regardless of whether they are yours or mine, large or small trees, good or bad, all will be priced and handed over to the public, concentrated and distributed together.”

    As soon as these words were spoken, the masses, who had been drowsy and yawning, suddenly erupted. An old man was the first to express his disagreement, and many voices echoed his.

    In this difficult situation, Xu Yunxiang only had one last resort. He said in an angry tone: "To tell you the truth, the government can help with the difficulties now, otherwise, we won't be able to take care of it in the future, and you can't blame anyone then." Seeing that the crowd had calmed down, he added definitively: "That's the way it is. Everyone bring materials tomorrow and start working."

    Just as the district's mutual aid and cooperation production disaster relief representative meeting was about to end, the "collective housing" in the Eighth Electoral District of Luzhou Township had already completed seventy identical bedrooms, and another one hundred and eighty-five were waiting to be thatched. This "collective housing" had already been distributed to the masses by lottery. District Committee Secretary Liao Jingming was very excited upon receiving this news, and said with a bit of self-importance: "This 'collective housing' is not far from the highway. In the future, when leaders from the province or central government pass by in their cars, they will definitely be surprised: 'Huh! What is this place?' Maybe they will even make a special trip to visit!" Although the plan to organize a meeting of representatives to visit was stopped by the county party secretary, he still felt a great sense of success, because the realization of the plan to build "collective housing" was the result of his hard work for more than a month.

    Hard work was spent, but the result was very bad. The facts gave the elated district committee secretary great disappointment.

    The "collective housing" was unpopular with the masses from the start. It faced even more opposition after being built. Many people were dissatisfied with the houses they were assigned and were unwilling to live in them. Some said: "I originally had three large fir houses, but I exchanged them for these small, flimsy shacks. It's too unfair." Some said that their families had elderly people, and they felt the new houses were too far away and it was inconvenient to fetch water. Some didn't want to live in thatched houses and would wait for the district committee secretary to build a collective tile house in the future before moving in. There were also several families whose assigned houses were on the site of the original graves, who were afraid of breaking "taboos" and refused to live there. They refused to live in the "collective housing," and their own houses had been demolished, so they built small sheds on the embankment to live in.

    Liao Jingming's "initiative" did not have any "socialist" influence on the masses as he had hoped, but only caused confusion in the masses' thinking and many misunderstandings about socialism. Some people said: "What land or anything else, in a few years we'll all be living together!" Some farmers were afraid of sharing materials to build houses, so they hurried to sell their wood. Zhou Desi, a farmer from the Ninth Electoral District, was chopping firewood in Jinniu Town when he heard about this matter, and stopped chopping wood. He rushed back and spent over 40,000 on eating and drinking in two days.

    When people from other villages passed by the Eighth Electoral District of Luzhou Township, they shook their heads and ridiculed: "This is the socialist big thatched house!"

    Could it be that no one in the Fifth District could see through such a "good deed" that was dominated by agricultural socialism and a desire for great achievements, and carried out by means of coercion? Could it have passed through the district committee and the district's mutual aid and cooperation production disaster relief representative meeting so smoothly? Of course not. At the Echeng County District Committee Work Group Leader Cadre Meeting held on September 19, the Fifth District Committee Work Group Leader Meeting held on September 28, and the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Production Disaster Relief Representative Meeting held on October 4, some cadres raised objections; however, these opinions did not attract the attention of the county committee, nor were they well considered by District Committee Secretary Liao Jingming, nor were they brought up for discussion. They were simply dismissed with words such as "the masses need to be persuaded and educated" and "we must proceed from the long-term interests of the masses."

    After discussing the district committee's plan to build "collective housing," district cadre Zhu Linbao and several members of the Luzhou Township Party Branch raised some disagreements with Liao Jingming: For example, how would the elderly cook on rainy and snowy days if the kitchen was so far away? If a husband and wife had a small child, and the husband went out to work, and the wife cooked at home, and the kitchen was far away, what would happen if the child fell to the ground? How did this district committee secretary treat them? First, he glanced at them, ignored them, and when they raised their opinions again, he put on a stern face and said: "This is what socialism looks like, why are you against it?" They were so frightened that they retreated repeatedly.

    Strangely, Peng Ying, Deputy Secretary of the Echeng County Committee, and Li Wenming, the County Head, and others, went to the Fifth District (the county committee's key district) during that period to understand the work situation, and they also understood this matter, but they did not stop it from happening. Naturally, it was not that these county leaders did not have the power to stop it. I ask, if the higher-ups also agreed with Liao Jingming's plan, who could stop it? The fact is that when Liao Jingming told Peng and Li about this plan, Peng Ying said: "Old Liao is doing the right thing!" Li Wenming patted Liao Jingming on the shoulder and said: "Good, let's do it!" The "encouragement" from the higher-ups naturally made Liao Jingming work even harder. County Party Secretary Zhang Jinkun did not stop the implementation of this subjective plan, but only stopped the organization of representatives to visit, so this "initiative" has not yet been "promoted throughout the district." But how can this be considered that the county-level leading cadres have fulfilled their responsibilities?

    “集体房屋”
    任敏  蒲雯
    去年十月四日深夜，湖北鄂城五区芦洲乡群众从睡梦中被唤起来开“紧急会议”。快下山的上弦月儿，无力地照着没精打采的揉着眼睛的群众。区干部祝林保和芦洲乡党支部副书记许运祥白天在区里开了一天的互助合作生产救灾代表会议，这时已经十分疲惫。他们两人是在会后奉着区委会的指示连夜赶到芦洲乡八选区来发动群众盖“集体房屋”的。因为这个区去年部分地区遭了水灾，不少群众的房屋毁坏了，领导上决定要为灾民重建家园。
    区委的指示非常紧急，规定必须在三天内把
  “集体房屋”盖好，并且要完全按照区委关于盖
  “集体房屋”的建筑计划进行。这个计划是：盖相对两排卧房，都要一般大小，卧房前两边各盖一排厨房，中间做花园，再前一顺溜盖上牛栏、猪圈、鸡屋、鸭舍，中间为会议室，旁边还要盖一座仓库等等。区里的互助合作生产救灾代表会议结束后，还要组织代表前来参观，然后把这一经验在全区推广。因此，祝林保和许运祥这时虽然感到眼皮沉重，仍不得不勉强打起精神来干。
    祝林保站在高处放大喉咙喊着：“区委决定，我们要办社会主义，要夥着做集体房屋……。”他接着将区委书记廖镜明日间讲的话向群众传达了一番：“重建家园不容易，材料、人力到处都是困难，只有做‘集体房屋’才能克服困难。”
    “房子要三天盖成，”许运祥接着祝林保说：“有材料的都拿出来，离堤五十公尺以内所有的房屋，必须统统拆掉，不管你的我的，大树小树，好的坏的，一律折价归公，集中调配，夥做夥分。”
    这句话刚一落口，本来睡意未消，呵欠连天的群众突然轰了起来，一个老头首先表示不同意，许多声音都附和着。
    处在这种上下为难情况下的许运祥，只有来最后这么一手了，他带着发怒的声调叫道：“跟大家说句实话，现在有困难，政府可以帮助，要不然，将来我们可管不着，到那时可不能埋怨谁。”看着群众平静下去了，他又斩钉截铁地补一句：“就这么办，明天大家带材料来开始动手。”
            ×　×　×
    正当区里互助合作生产救灾代表会议快要结束的时候，芦洲乡八选区的“集体房屋”已建成七十间大小一样的卧室，其他一百八十五间正待盖草。这座“集体房屋”已用抽签的办法分配给群众了。区委书记廖镜明得到这个消息很兴奋，有点忘其所以地说：“这个‘集体房屋’就隔公路不远，将来从省里或中央来的首长，坐在汽车上看到了定会惊奇：‘咦！这是什么地方？’兴许还要特地来参观参观哩！”虽然组织开会代表前往参观的打算被县委书记制止了，但他还是感到极大的成功的快乐，因为盖“集体房屋”计划的实现，是他一个多月来花费心血的结果。
    心血是花费了，但结果却糟糕得很，事实给了兴高采烈的区委书记很大的失望。
    “集体房屋”开始动工时就不受群众欢迎。盖起以后更遭到反对。许多群众不满意分给自己的房屋，不愿去住。有的说：“我原来三间大杉树屋，换了这两根拨灯棒子的小屋，太不公道。”有的说他家有老人，嫌新屋太远，吃水不方便；有的不想住草屋，等将来区委书记再盖一栋集体瓦屋，那时再住未迟；还有好几家分的屋的地基原来是坟墓，怕犯“忌讳”也不肯住。他们不肯住“集体房屋”，自己的屋又被拆了，于是就搭个小棚子在堤上安身。
    廖镜明的这个“创举”，并没有如他所指望的在群众中起着什么“社会主义”的影响，而只是造成了群众思想的混乱和对社会主义的许多误解。有人就说：“什么土地不土地，没有几年就要夥家了！”有的农民怕夥料做屋，赶忙把树料卖了。九选区农民周德似在金牛镇砍柴，听说这件事，柴也不砍了，赶回来大吃大喝，两天花了四万多。
    外乡群众路过芦洲乡八选区，都摇头讥讽地说：“这就是社会主义的大茅屋呀！”
    难道这样一个由农业社会主义和好大喜功的思想支配的，用强迫命令的手段去做的“好事”，在五区就没有一个人看得出来吗？竟能这样顺利地通过了区委会和全区互助合作生产救灾代表会议吗？当然不是的。九月十九日在鄂城县召开的区委工作组长干部会，九月二十八日五区开的区委工作组长会，以及十月四日的互助合作生产救灾代表会议上，都有干部提出过反对意见；但这些意见都没有引起县委的注意，也未被区委书记廖镜明很好考虑过，也不提出来讨论，仅以什么“群众是要说服教育的”、“要从群众长远利益出发”等等言语支开。
    区干部祝林保和芦洲乡党支部的几个委员在讨论了区委盖“集体房屋”的计划后，向廖镜明提出一些不同意的地方：譬如说吧，厨房做得那么远，雨雪天老人做饭怎么办？夫妻俩口带一小伢，男的出外干活，女的在家做饭，厨房又远，小伢掉到地下来怎么办？而这位区委书记是怎样对待他们的呢？先是望了他们一眼，理也没理他们，他们再次提出意见，他把面孔一板说：“这就是一个走社会主义的样子，为什么反对？”吓得他们连连退出。
    奇怪的是，鄂城县委副书记彭英、县长李文明等在那段时间都曾到五区（县委重点区）去了解过工作情况，并且也都了解这件事，但却没有阻止它的发生。这自然不是这些县的领导干部没有权力来加以阻止。试问，如果上级也赞成廖镜明这个计划的话，谁又能阻止呢？事实也正是这样的：当廖镜明把这个计划告诉彭、李两人的时候，彭英说：
  “老廖做得对头！”李文明把廖镜明的肩膀一拍说：“好，干吧！”上级的“鼓励”自然使廖镜明干得更加有劲。县委书记张金锟没有制止这种主观主义计划的执行，只制止了组织代表前往参观，因而这一“创举”还没有在“全区推广”。但是这样怎么能算是县级领导干部尽到了自己的责任呢？
