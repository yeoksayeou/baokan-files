    Geological Survey of Riverbed for Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Completed
    The geological survey of the riverbed for the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was completed on January 10th. From late spring of 1954 to now, the geological drilling personnel experienced the worst flood of the Yangtze River in a century, as well as the unprecedented cold and violent wind and waves on the Yangtze River in Wuhan for many years. Around New Year's Day this year, there were several snowy nights with temperatures as low as minus ten degrees Celsius, but the drillers still persevered in their work on the river, making fires to keep warm. In a short period of seven months, they finally completed the detailed geological survey of the riverbed between Yellow Crane Tower in Wuchang and Tortoise Mountain in Hanyang, drilling a total of 103 boreholes, penetrating the riverbed's overburden and rock layers to a depth of more than 3,300 meters, and extracting a large number of core samples from the riverbed. This survey has obtained more detailed and reliable geological data of the riverbed than the previous preliminary survey. Based on this data, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau, with the help of Soviet experts, is studying and determining a better bridge crossing line and carrying out the technical design of the bridge foundation.

    武汉长江大桥河槽地质勘探完成
    武汉长江大桥河槽地质勘探工作已在一月十日完成。从一九五四年春末到现在，地质钻探人员们经历了长江百年未有的特大洪水，经历了武汉多年来未有的严寒和长江上的狂风巨浪。今年元旦前后，江上一连是几个零下十度的雪夜，钻工们仍然在江心生火坚持工作。在短短七个月之内，他们终于在武昌黄鹤楼到汉阳龟山之间的江上完成了河槽的地质详查，共钻探了一百零三个钻孔，钻进江底覆盖层和岩层三千三百多公尺深，从江底取出了大量岩芯。这次勘探工作比过去的初步勘探获得了更为详尽可靠的河槽地质资料。根据这些资料，武汉长江大桥工程局正在苏联专家帮助下研究确定一条比较好的桥渡线，并进行桥梁基础的技术设计工作。
