Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 31st: Moscow newspapers are commenting extensively on the French National Assembly's vote on the Paris Accords.

    "Pravda's" Paris correspondent, Lasakin, wrote: "When the bill on the Paris Accords was voted on December 24th, the first article was rejected by the National Assembly. This was a manifestation of the will of the French people. In the six days that followed, protracted night votes were held on the second and third articles, along with behind-the-scenes deals and conspiracies. Britain and the United States have been intensifying their pressure on France and on members of the French National Assembly. This pressure reached an extremely blatant, not to mention shameless, level.

    One of the deputies who spoke in Parliament on December 29th frankly admitted that if the deputies had voted according to their own opinions, without external pressure, the Paris Accords would have been rejected.

    The bourgeois newspapers of the United States and Britain intimidated the French Parliament. Mendès-France also constantly threatened the deputies with warnings of "French isolation" and the "collapse of the Atlantic alliance."

    However, supporters of West German rearmament had to settle for a mere majority of twenty-odd votes in the National Assembly. None of the bourgeois parties in France voted unanimously in favor of arming West Germany. About half of the deputies from some parties opposed the Paris Accords.

    Lasakin continued: "The National Assembly has made a decision that goes against the will of the people. People are saying everywhere in Paris: Can it really be considered that the Paris Accords have been genuinely approved by the National Assembly? What value does this approval have? Outside the walls of the Palais Bourbon, a wave of popular anger is constantly rising."

    An editorial in "Izvestia" wrote: "Observers say that in the past fifty years of French history, the basic standards of parliamentary politics have never been violated as crudely and impudently as this time. Supporters of the Paris Accords spared no effort in exerting pressure on deputies in the most shameless way and engaging in the most despicable conspiracies behind the scenes. Washington and London constantly harangued the French deputies in a domineering manner, following threats with hypocritical exhortations and attempting to cast doubt on the intentions of other countries, primarily the Soviet Union. In the final days, various behind-the-scenes political deals and intimidation of wavering deputies became a complete travesty of deputies' rights."

    American and British diplomacy also resorted to direct blackmail against the deputies. "Le Figaro" reported that a counselor from the embassy of a "friendly nation"—meaning Britain—had called certain deputies, asking them to vote in favor of ratifying the Paris Accords. "Paris Radical News" pointed out: "But all these tricks and underhanded dealings cannot hide the 'unusual difficulties' that the supporters of the Paris Accords encountered in Parliament." The "substance of these accords cannot completely satisfy anyone."

    "Izvestia" continued, pointing out that the situation in the French Parliament was very similar to that in the British House of Commons: far less than half of the members of the House of Commons voted in favor of the Paris Accords. "Izvestia" concluded by saying that the French people had clearly demonstrated, during the parliamentary debate on ratification, their resolute rejection of these accords, which would allow German militarists to do as they pleased. The French people will never support the Paris Accords because this agreement is obviously contrary to the national interests of France and the needs of European peace and security.

      "Trud" published an article signed "Correspondent," entitled "The Struggle Is Not Over." The author wrote that the National Assembly's decision may make it easier for American imperialists to carry out their conspiracies in Europe, primarily the revival of the German "Wehrmacht." But everyone knows that this will drastically worsen France's position on the international stage, forcing France to face its age-old enemy, German militarism, alone. Such a policy will inevitably worsen the entire political situation in Europe and increase the risk of another devastating war. Needless to say, the full responsibility for these consequences rests with the rulers of Western countries—including France.

    The author emphasized that the struggle is not over. The vote in the National Assembly by no means finally resolves the issue of French ratification of the Paris Accords. The French people are intensifying their resistance to the aggressive plans to revive German militarism. The people of all countries, the upright patriots of all countries, and all true advocates of peace are rising to join the movement against the revival of German militarism. The indomitable determination of the people of all countries to have peace cannot be broken!

### 苏联报纸评论法国议会对巴黎协定的表决

    苏联报纸评论法国议会对巴黎协定的表决
   【新华社三十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科三十一日讯：莫斯科报纸纷纷评论法国国民议会对巴黎协定的表决。
    “真理报”驻巴黎记者拉萨金写道：在十二月二十四日举行对巴黎协定法案的表决时，第一条被国民议会否决了。这是法国人民意志的表现。在这以后的六天中，对第二条和第三条进行了延宕的夜间表决，而且进行了幕后的交易和阴谋。英美两国一直在加强对法国和对法国国民议会议员的压力。这种压力达到了极端露骨的程度，更不用说无耻了。
    十二月二十九日在议会中发言的议员中有一位坦白地承认，如果议员们是在没有外来压力的情况下按照他们自己的意见投票的话，巴黎协定本来是会遭到拒绝的。
    美英两国的资产阶级报纸都对法国议会进行了恫吓。孟戴斯—弗朗斯也不断用“法国孤立”和“大西洋联盟垮台”这种威胁的话来威吓议员们。
    但是，西德重新武装的支持者们已不得不满足于国民议会中二十几票的区区多数。在法国的资产阶级政党中没有一个政党是一致投票赞成武装西德的。有些党派约有半数议员反对巴黎协定。
    拉萨金继续写道：国民议会已经违背人民的意志作出了决定。人们在巴黎到处都可以听到这种说法：难道能够认为巴黎协定真正得到国民议会的批准了吗？这种批准有什么价值呢？波旁宫宫墙外面，人民愤怒的浪潮正在不断高涨。
    “消息报”的社论写道：观察家们说，在过去五十年的法国历史上，议会政治的基本标准从来没有遭到过像这一次这样粗暴而无礼的破坏。巴黎协定的支持者们不惜以最无耻的方式对议员施加压力，在幕后进行最卑鄙的阴谋。华盛顿和伦敦不断蛮横地对法国议员叫嚷，威胁之后跟着是虚伪的劝告，并且企图使人对其他国家，首先是对苏联的意图发生怀疑。在最后几天，各种幕后的政治交易和对犹豫不决的议员们的恐吓成了对议员权利的十足的讽刺。
    美英外交方面也不惜对议员们进行直接的讹诈。“费加罗报”报道说，一个“友邦”——意指英国——的大使馆参赞曾打电话给某些议员，要求他们投票赞成批准巴黎协定。“巴黎激进新闻”指出：但是，这一切诡计和偷偷摸摸的勾当都不能掩盖巴黎协定的支持者们在议会中碰到的“异乎寻常的困难”。这些协定的“实质不能使任何人完全满意”。
    “消息报”继续指出，法国议会的情况很像英国下院的情况：在下院议员中只有远远不到半数的人投票赞成巴黎协定。“消息报”结语说，法国人民在议会讨论批准问题期间明确地表明了他们坚决唾弃这些使德国军国主义者能够为所欲为的协定。法国人民将永远不支持巴黎协定，因为这个协定同法国的民族利益、同欧洲和平和安全的需要明显地背道而驰。
      “劳动报”刊载了一篇署名“记者”的文章，题目是“斗争还没有结束”。作者写道，国民议会的决定也许使美帝国主义者比较容易执行他们在欧洲的阴谋，首先是复活德国“国防军”。但是谁都知道这将使法国在国际舞台上的地位急剧恶化，使得法国必须单枪匹马地面对它世世代代的敌人——德国军国主义。这样一种政策将无可避免地使欧洲的整个政治局势恶化，并且增加爆发另一次毁灭性的战争的危险。不用说，这种后果的全部责任要由西方国家——包括法国在内——的统治者来担负。
    作者着重说，斗争还没有结束。国民议会的表决远没有最后解决法国批准巴黎协定的问题。法国人民正加紧他们对复活德国军国主义的侵略计划的反抗。世界各国人民、各国的正直的爱国人士、所有和平的真正拥护者都在起来参加反对德国军国主义复活的运动。各国人民要和平的不屈不挠的决心是打不破的！
