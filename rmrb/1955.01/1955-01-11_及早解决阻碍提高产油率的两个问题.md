The National Oil Industry Advanced Experience Exchange Conference ended two months ago. Many provinces and cities have held meetings and set specific targets for increasing oil production. After learning about the significant economic and political implications of increasing oil production, workers in many oil factories across the country have overcome their conservative ideas to varying degrees and reversed the past mistaken belief that engaging in oil production was unpromising, thereby enhancing their enthusiasm for production. In Qiqihar City, since November of last year, workers in various oil factories have launched a labor competition centered on learning Li Chuanjiang's oil pressing method. As a result, the soybean oil yield has generally reached over 14%, with the highest reaching 15.2%. Calculated based on the state-stipulated oil yield of 12%, more than 133,000 catties of oil were produced for the country in two months. In Zhejiang, the joint state-private Jin Hua Oil Pressing Factory achieved a soybean oil yield of 15.06% in mid-November, with the highest reaching 15.31%, setting the factory's highest oil yield record in history.

However, according to recent reports from the Mudanjiang City Federation of Trade Unions, the processing fees for oil factories in the city are calculated based on the quantity of beans processed. Therefore, in order to pursue processing fees, the factories try to increase the pressing volume as much as possible, without paying attention to increasing the oil yield, which increases the residual oil rate in the oil cake. This is inconsistent with the state's principle of increasing oil production without increasing raw materials. According to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Light Industry Workers' Union Working Committee, this situation is still quite common. The reasons are: first, the processing method is unreasonable, essentially rewarding simply increasing the processing volume; second, some oil factories lack clear oil yield targets in their production plans, and often simply pursue processing volume in order to complete the plan; third, the rewards of some oil factories are mainly based on the size of the processing volume, which cannot stimulate the increase of oil yield; fourth, some enterprise leaders have capitalist management ideas. Before the promulgation of a new unified processing contract method, all relevant units must, in accordance with the state's policy of saving raw materials and increasing oil production, jointly negotiate to overcome the tendency of simply pursuing processing volume. This is a problem worthy of attention at present.

Many oil factories are run by cooperatives and grain departments, and their oil yields are generally lower than those of state-owned and local state-owned oil factories. Their potential is quite large, and they should become the focus of increasing oil production in various provinces and cities. However, the equipment conditions of these oil factories are relatively poor, their technical force is weak, they are numerous and scattered, making them difficult to lead, and the leadership does not pay close attention, so the work of promoting advanced experience in increasing oil yield is poorly carried out. Therefore, on the one hand, it is necessary to strengthen leadership over them, and on the other hand, it is necessary to provide them with technical assistance in an organized manner so that they can quickly promote advanced experience and improve technology. This is very important for completing the plan to increase oil production by 200 million catties.

January to April is the most intense season for oil pressing, so these two problems must be resolved as soon as possible.

    及早解决阻碍提高产油率的两个问题
    曾其
    全国油脂工业先进经验交流大会会议已结束两个月了。许多省市都召开了会议，订出了增产油脂的具体目标。各地不少油脂厂的职工知道了增产油脂在经济上、政治上的重大意义后，都在不同的程度上克服了保守的想法，并扭转了过去认为搞油脂生产没出息的错误思想，提高了生产积极性。在齐齐哈尔市，各油厂职工从去年十一月份起开展了以学习李川江榨油法为主要内容的劳动竞赛，结果大豆产油率普遍达到百分之十四以上，其中最高的达到百分之十五点二。按照国家规定的产油率百分之十二计算，在两个月内就为国家增产十三万三千多斤油脂。在浙江，公私合营的金华榨油厂，十一月中旬大豆产油率达百分之十五点零六，最高的达到百分之十五点三一，创造该厂历史上最高的产油纪录。
    但据最近牡丹江市工会联合会反映，该市各油厂加工费是按加工豆子数量计算的，因而各厂为了追求加工费，就尽量提高压榨量，而不注意提高产油率，增加了油饼的残油率。这跟国家所要求的在不增加原料的条件下，增产油脂的原则是不符合的。据中华全国总工会轻工业工会工作委员会所了解，这种情况，目前还相当普遍。其原因是：一，加工办法不合理，实质上是奖励单纯提高加工量；二，有些油厂在生产计划中缺乏明确的产油率指标，往往为了完成计划，就单纯追求加工量；三，有的油厂的奖励，以加工处理量大小为主要标准，不能刺激产油率的提高；四，某些企业的领导干部有资本主义的经营思想。在新的统一的加工合同办法没有颁布以前，各有关单位必须根据国家节约原料增产油脂的方针，共同协商，克服单纯追求加工量的偏向，这是当前值得注意的一个问题。
    合作社和粮食部门的油厂很多，产油率一般都比国营和地方国营油厂的低，潜在能力相当大，应成为各省、市增产油脂的重点。但是，这些油厂的设备条件较差，技术力量薄弱，单位多而分散，不好领导，而领导抓的又不紧，所以推广提高产油率的先进经验的工作开展得较差。因此，一方面要加强对它们的领导，另一方面，要有组织地给他们以技术援助，以便使它们迅速地推广先进经验，提高技术。这对于完成增产两亿斤油脂计划是非常重要的。
    一月到四月，是榨油的最紧张季节，所以必须及早解决这两个问题。
