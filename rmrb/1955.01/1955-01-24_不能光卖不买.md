Recently, state-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in Henan Province have overcome the tendency to hoard goods and have strengthened market supply, which has greatly improved the sluggish market situation, to the satisfaction of the masses. However, some cadres, due to insufficient understanding of the significance of enlivening the rural economy, have only been busy with market supply and have relaxed the procurement of products, resulting in a general decline in the procurement volume of local and special products in late December of last year. Cotton decreased by 20% compared to mid-December, tobacco leaves decreased by 22%, sesame decreased by 30%, and other products also showed a downward trend. December of last year was supposed to be the peak procurement season, but the total procurement value decreased by 24% compared to November. Some district cooperatives relaxed their efforts to go to the countryside for procurement. For example, the Luoyang Ninth District Cooperative went to the countryside for procurement five times in early December, twice in mid-December, and did not go at all in late December. The Chengguan Cotton Procurement Station in Taikang County, fearing trouble, refused to accept yellow cotton, telling the masses to sell it freely on the streets. Nine counties in Zhengzhou Prefecture transferred personnel from the procurement offices to work on supplying the market, which left the procurement business unattended, seriously affecting the completion of the procurement tasks.

In order to invigorate rural economic life, it is correct to focus on the supply of materials; however, it is wrong to relax the procurement of products. Because if the masses cannot sell their products, they cannot buy back the things they need; if we do not receive products, we cannot supply the needs of the masses. Just think: if we do not procure cotton, what will we use to supply the masses with cotton batting and cloth? If we do not procure oil-bearing crops, what will we use to supply the masses with cooking oil and lamp oil? If this continues, supply and sales will inevitably become disconnected. Therefore, we must establish a comprehensive work perspective, both to do a good job in the supply of materials and to do a good job in the procurement of products. Only through close cooperation between supply and sales can we ensure the completion of the state's procurement and supply tasks and meet the needs of the masses for livelihood and means of production.

    不能光卖不买
    姚福年
    最近，河南省的国营商业部门和供销合作社克服了惜售思想，加强了市场供应工作，使市场死滞现象大有好转，群众很满意。但是，有一部分干部由于对活跃农村经济的意义认识不足，只忙于市场供应，放松了产品收购，致使去年十二月下旬土产特产品的收购量普遍下降。棉花较中旬下降百分之二十，烟叶下降百分之二十二，芝麻下降百分之三十，其他产品也都有下降趋势。去年十二月本是收购旺季，但收购总值却较十一月下降百分之二十四。有些区的合作社放松了下乡收购。如洛阳九区合作社十二月上旬下乡收购五次，中旬下乡收购两次，下旬就没下去。太康县城关棉花收购站怕麻烦不收黄棉，叫群众在街上自由出卖。郑州专区九个县都把收购办公室人员抽出去搞供应市场工作，致使收购业务没人管，严重地影响了收购任务的完成。
    为了活跃农村经济生活，抓紧物资供应工作是正确的；但是，放松了产品收购工作却是错误的。因为群众产品卖不出，就不能买回他们需要的东西；我们收不到产品，就供应不了群众需要。试想：如果不收棉花，拿什么来供应群众絮棉和纱布？收不来油料，拿什么来供应群众吃油点灯呢？这样发展下去，势必弄得供销脱节。因此我们必须树立全面工作观点，既要作好物资供应，还要搞好产品收购，只有供销密切配合，才能保证国家收购和供应任务的完成，满足群众生活和生产资料的需要。
