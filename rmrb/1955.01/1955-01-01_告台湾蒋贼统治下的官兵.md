To the Officers and Soldiers Under the Rule of the Chiang Kai-shek Bandits in Taiwan

    As our people celebrate the New Year's Day of 1955, our motherland is leaping forward. The Chinese Communist Party is leading the people of the whole country to build our motherland into a strong socialist industrial country. Large-scale planned economic construction has entered its third year. Our road is infinitely broad, and our future is infinitely bright.

    In the mighty ranks advancing along the road of socialism, many are Chiang army officers and soldiers who have spontaneously revolted and defected during the people's revolutionary war and in recent years. Some of them have been allocated land in the countryside, some have found jobs in the cities, and some have joined the People's Army, standing on the glorious post of defending the motherland and defending socialist construction. Many of these Chiang army officers and soldiers who have revolted and defected have already made contributions to their great motherland and people on various fronts, becoming glorious combat heroes, labor models, work models, or people's representatives, and are loved and respected by the people of the motherland.

    However, even today, hundreds of thousands of Chiang army officers and soldiers are still being deceived and蒙蔽ed by the American aggressors and traitor Chiang Kai-shek, not understanding the true situation and bright future of our great motherland, nor understanding the policies of the Communist Party and the People's Government and the People's Liberation Army towards Chiang army officers and soldiers. They often miss their motherland and their relatives, but they dare not resolutely revolt or defect. They hear the Chiang bandits' rumors that "All those who return to the mainland from Taiwan will be beheaded." This shameless lie has long been exposed by the ironclad facts of Tao Kaifu, Hu Hongyi, Wang Weihua, Liu Rongqing and others who have returned and received lenient treatment, but some people still doubt the lenient policies of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government. Now, the Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China has issued a circular and order, once again announcing the fundamental policies and specific handling methods for Chiang army officers and soldiers who revolt, defect, and voluntarily lay down their weapons on the battlefield.

    The circular of the Ministry of National Defense solemnly declares: The revolt and defection of Chiang army officers and soldiers is a patriotic and just action. This action is beneficial to the motherland and the people, beneficial to the liberation of millions of compatriots in Taiwan, and beneficial to the cause of defending Asian and world peace and the progress of all mankind. We judge the glory and shame, justice and injustice of any action according to this standard.

    Everyone knows that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has long been a faithful running dog of imperialism. During their more than 20 years of ruling China, they signed countless treaties that humiliated the country and forfeited its sovereignty with foreign imperialism, and in 1931, they offered the entire Northeast to Japanese imperialism, making tens of millions of compatriots in the Northeast colonial slaves for nearly 20 years, and allowing Japanese imperialism to launch a full-scale war of aggression against our country without any scruples, causing our people to suffer a full eight years of war disaster. In the years when the Chinese people were fighting hard against the war, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique frantically attacked the people's army everywhere and massacred patriotic people in large numbers. After Japan surrendered, they introduced the ferocious American imperialism into China and launched an even larger and more cruel anti-people civil war. Their criminal activities angered the entire Chinese people, and finally in 1949, they were driven out of the mainland by the Chinese people and fled to Taiwan. But this shameless traitorous clique has not repented in the slightest. For more than five years, they have been following the will of their American masters, taking the weapons supplied by their American masters, and constantly harassing our country's oceans and coastal areas, plundering people's property, forcibly dragging people to be cannon fodder, and attacking merchant ships of various countries, attempting to provoke new wars to harm the people. Recently, this traitorous clique has become even more intensified and concluded a war treaty with the United States. The position of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek is no different from that of Puyi and Wang Jingwei in those years. At this time, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is more shameless than ever, and does not want any covering. Their hatred for the people has reached a state of madness. They openly sell everything to the American aggressors, only seeking to receive a little reward and favor. For this Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique with overflowing crimes, our people must completely eliminate it and finally drive the American aggressors out of our country's territory. At this time, anyone's actions, as long as they are consistent with the glorious struggle goal of the Chinese people, and are conducive to the Chinese people realizing this struggle goal, are of course a glorious and just action.

    Some people have done bad things in the past, can they also receive lenient treatment? The answer is absolutely yes. The circular and order issued by the Ministry of National Defense pointed out that for Chiang army officers and soldiers who defect or surrender individually or collectively, the People's Government will not investigate the past, and will give lenient treatment; those who make meritorious service will be rewarded, those who are willing to work will be given work, those who are willing to go home will be given travel expenses, soldiers will be given land to settle down and start a business, and those who bring weapons to return will be given rewards; for Chiang army uprising troops, they will be reorganized in accordance with the principles of the People's Liberation Army, politically treated equally with the People's Liberation Army, and treated equally with the People's Liberation Army; uprising officers will be employed according to their talents and abilities, and their private property will be protected; those who revolt by flying planes or warships will be given generous rewards respectively; for Chiang army officers and soldiers who voluntarily lay down their weapons on the battlefield, their lives will also be guaranteed, they will not be beaten, scolded, or insulted, their private property will not be confiscated, the wounded and sick will be given treatment, and those who are willing to go home will be given travel expenses. This policy and specific handling methods are completely consistent with the policies that the People's Liberation Army has consistently implemented for decades. The joint declaration of the democratic parties of our country for the liberation of Taiwan on August 22, 1954, has already shown the spirit of this policy. All Chiang army officers and soldiers, as long as they can resolutely revolt or defect, the motherland still welcomes them back to the embrace of the motherland, and the people of the motherland can still forgive them, pardon them, and give them the opportunity to live and the opportunity to serve the motherland and the people.

    The reason why we adopt such policies and handling methods is, on the one hand, because any revolt and defection is beneficial to the people; on the other hand, it is also because Chiang army officers and soldiers have always been deceived, 蒙蔽ed and threatened, and at the same time, a bad environment has prompted some of them to learn bad habits. If they understand the facts, understand the truth, and are placed in our good environment, they will gradually realize and repent. In fact, many Chiang army officers and soldiers who have revolted, defected and been captured in the past have corrected many of their original bad habits under our lenient policies and patient education, and have done many things that are beneficial to the country and the people. We are of course equally willing to encourage and help those who come later to take this path.

    Due to the great political and economic victories of our great motherland, our country's international status has been unprecedentedly improved; the hearts of millions of Taiwan compatriots and hundreds of thousands of Chiang army officers and soldiers are increasingly turning to the motherland, and more and more Chiang army officers and soldiers hope to find opportunities to revolt or defect. The fate of the final demise of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has been doomed.

    All Chiang army officers and soldiers with a conscience, you have been forced to stay in Taiwan by the Chiang bandits for five years, and the Chiang bandits' nonsense of "one year of preparation, two years of counterattack, three years of sweeping, and five years of success" has now been completely exposed! After the signing of the US-Chiang traitorous treaty, in order to drive you to be cannon fodder, US imperialism recently handed over some outdated Sabre aircraft and old warships used in World War II that were defeated in the Korean War to the Chiang bandits, dreaming of using these old weapons to deceive you into selling your lives for him. You only need to think about the outcome of the Korean War to understand that the result of the United States giving these weapons to the Chiang bandits is only one, that is, like the war of aggression against Korea, it will definitely suffer a complete defeat. You should no longer be slaves and cannon fodder for US imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek, and no longer oppose the people by following the deadly enemy of the Chinese people. If you are unwilling to bury your future, you should use every possible opportunity to abandon that shameful dead end and bravely embark on the glorious road to life!

### 告台湾蒋贼统治下的官兵

    告台湾蒋贼统治下的官兵
    当我国人民欢度一九五五年元旦的时候，我们的祖国正在飞跃地前进。中国共产党领导着全国人民，要把我们的祖国建设成为强大的社会主义工业国。大规模的有计划的经济建设，已经进入第三个年头。我们的道路无限广阔，我们的前途无限光明。
    在沿着社会主义前进的强大队伍中，有许多是在人民革命战争时期和最近几年以来自动起义和投诚过来的蒋军官兵。他们有的在农村分到了土地，有的在城市中找到了工作，有的参加了人民的军队，站在保卫祖国、保卫社会主义建设的光荣岗位上。这些起义和投诚过来的蒋军官兵，有不少人已经在各个战线上为自己伟大的祖国和人民立了功，变成了光荣的战斗英雄、劳动模范、工作模范或者人民代表，受到祖国人民的爱护和尊敬。
    但是直到今天，还有数十万蒋军官兵受着美国侵略者和卖国贼蒋介石的欺骗和蒙蔽，不了解我们伟大祖国的真实状况和光明前途，也不大了解共产党和人民政府、人民解放军对待蒋军官兵的政策。他们经常怀念祖国和自己的亲人，但是不敢毅然起义或投诚过来。他们听到蒋贼的造谣是：“凡是从台湾回大陆的都会被杀头。”这种无耻的谎言，早已被陶开府、胡弘一、王维华、刘荣庆等归来以后受到宽大待遇的铁的事实所揭破，但是仍然有人在怀疑中国共产党和人民政府的宽大政策。现在中华人民共和国国防部发布了通告和命令，再一次宣布了关于对待起义投诚和战场上自动放下武器的蒋军官兵的根本政策和具体处理办法。
    国防部的通告庄严地宣布：蒋军官兵起义、投诚是爱国的正义行动。这种行动对祖国和人民有利，对解放台湾数百万同胞有利，对保卫亚洲和世界和平以及全人类的进步事业有利。我们判别任何行动的光荣和耻辱，正义和非正义都是根据这个标准。
    谁都知道，蒋介石卖国集团老早就作了帝国主义的忠实走狗。他们在统治中国的二十多年中，和外国帝国主义签订过无数丧权辱国的条约，并且在一九三一年把东北全部奉送了日本帝国主义，使东北数千万同胞做了将近二十年的殖民地奴隶，使日本帝国主义毫无顾忌地发动了全面侵略我国的战争，使我国人民遭受了整整八年的战争灾难。在中国人民艰苦抗战的年代，蒋介石卖国集团却丧心病狂地到处袭击人民的军队，大量屠杀爱国的人民。在日本投降之后，他们又把凶恶的美国帝国主义引进中国来，并且发动了更大规模和更残酷的反人民的内战。他们的罪恶活动激怒了全中国人民，终于在一九四九年被中国人民撵出大陆，逃到了台湾。但是这个无耻的卖国集团并没有丝毫悔祸之心。五年多来，他们一直秉承美国主子的意旨，拿着美国主子供给的武器，在我国海洋上和沿海一带不断骚扰，掳掠人民财产，强拉人民作炮灰，并且袭击各国商船，企图挑起新的战争来祸害人民。最近这个卖国集团更变本加厉，同美国缔结了战争条约。卖国贼蒋介石所处的地位，已经和当年的溥仪、汪精卫没有什么分别。在这个时候，蒋介石卖国集团是比任何时候都更加不顾廉耻了，任何一点遮羞的东西都不要了。他们仇恨人民已经达到了疯狂的程度，他们公开把所有的一切都出卖给了美国侵略者，只求能够得到一点点赏赐和恩宠。对于这样罪恶贯盈的蒋介石卖国集团，我国人民就一定要把它彻底消灭，并且把美国侵略者最后逐出我国国土。在这个时候，任何人的任何行动，只要和中国人民的这种光荣的奋斗目标相一致，有利于中国人民实现这一奋斗目标，当然就是一种光荣的和正义的行动。
    有些人过去作了坏事，是不是也能得到宽大的处理呢？答复是完全肯定的。国防部发布的通告和命令指出，对于个别或集体投诚来归的蒋军官兵，人民政府不究既往，一律给予宽大待遇；立功者受奖，愿工作者工作，愿回家者发给路费，士兵分给土地安家立业，携带武器来归者并给予奖赏；对于蒋军起义部队，一律按人民解放军宗旨加以整编，政治上与人民解放军一视同仁，待遇上与人民解放军一律平等；对起义军官量才录用，并保护其私人财产；驾驶飞机、舰艇起义者，并分别予以优厚奖赏；对于在战场上自动放下武器的蒋军官兵，同样保证生命安全，不打不骂不侮辱，不没收私人财物，伤病者给以治疗，愿回家者发给路费。这种政策和具体的处理办法，同过去数十年来人民解放军所一贯实行的政策是完全一致的。一九五四年八月二十二日我国各民主党派为解放台湾联合宣言就已经表明了这种政策的精神。所有的蒋军官兵，只要能够毅然起义或投诚，祖国仍然欢迎他们回到祖国的怀抱，祖国的人民就仍然能够原谅他们，宽恕他们，并且给他们以生活的机会、为祖国和人民效力的机会。
    我们所以采取这样的政策和处理办法，一方面是因为任何起义和投诚的行动都对人民有利；另一方面，也是因为蒋军官兵过去一直受着欺骗、蒙蔽和威胁，同时有一种恶劣的环境促使他们有一部分人学坏了。如果让他们明白了事实，明白了道理，同时放在我们的良好的环境中，他们就会逐渐觉悟过来，回心向善。事实上，过去有许多起义、投诚和被俘过来的蒋军官兵，已经在我们的宽大政策和耐心教育之下，改正了自己原来的许多不良习惯，作了许多对国家和人民有利的事情。后来者愿意走这条路，我们当然同样愿意鼓励和帮助他们这样走。
    由于我们伟大祖国在政治上和经济上的伟大胜利，我国的国际地位空前提高；数百万台湾同胞和数十万蒋军官兵的心也越来越转向祖国，希望寻找机会起义或投诚的蒋军官兵也就越来越多。蒋介石卖国集团最后覆亡的命运是已经注定了的。
    一切有良心的蒋军官兵们，你们被蒋贼强迫留在台湾已经五年了，蒋贼的什么“一年准备、二年反攻、三年扫荡、五年成功”的鬼话，现在已经彻底揭穿了！在美蒋卖国条约签订以后，美帝国主义为了驱使你们作炮灰，最近把一些在朝鲜战争中打败了的已经过时的佩刀式飞机和第二次世界大战用过的旧军舰交给蒋贼，梦想用这些旧武器来欺骗你们为他卖命，你们只要想一想朝鲜战争的结果就会明白，美国给蒋贼这些武器的结果只有一个，就是如侵犯朝鲜的战争一样，一定会遭到彻底的失败。你们不要再为美帝国主义和它的走狗蒋介石充当奴隶和炮灰，不要再跟着中国人民的死敌来反对人民，你们如果不愿意葬送自己的前途，就应该利用一切可能的机会抛弃那耻辱的死亡的绝路，勇敢地走上光荣的生路！
