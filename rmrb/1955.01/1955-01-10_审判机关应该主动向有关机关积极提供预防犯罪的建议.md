    Judicial Organs Should Actively Provide Crime Prevention Advice to Relevant Authorities
    Zhang Zhien, Li Chengye, Li Shufang
    We are adjudicators from the Anshan City People's Court in Liaoning Province. In handling cases of sabotage against national economic construction, we feel that the occurrence of various criminal acts, while certainly indicating that the remaining counter-revolutionaries have not been completely eliminated and that some state personnel are still infected with various undesirable ideologies, is also significantly due to the fact that relevant state-owned enterprise departments and state organs lack sufficient understanding of this situation and have not taken effective measures to prevent and combat crime. Based on our analysis and research of some cases, we believe the following issues are worth the attention of relevant state-owned enterprise departments and state organs.
    First, some state-owned factory and mine enterprise personnel are ideologically lax and have lost the necessary vigilance against sabotage, allowing saboteurs to take advantage of opportunities to commit crimes. For example, the total water gate of the circulating water pipe for the No. 3 and No. 4 sintering machines at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's ore dressing plant is an important production location. The water from the total water gate passes through the circulating water pipe to maintain the safety of the sintering machine's furnace body. According to safety production regulations, the water gate should be fitted with an iron cover and lock, and be the responsibility of a dedicated person for guarding it; otherwise, if the water gate breaks and the water source is cut off, the sintering machine's furnace body will be completely burnt. However, the plant did not add safety devices to such important production equipment, thus allowing the saboteur Fu Shizhong to take advantage of the opportunity to damage the total water gate, and the circulating water pipe's water source was cut off for a time. Fortunately, it was discovered and rescued by the workers in time, and only the circulating water pipe was burned through, and the two sintering machines only stopped for seven minutes, without causing major losses. Another example is when the Anshan Construction Engineering Company entrusted private merchants to process more than eighty tons of iron pipes. Because the private merchants cut corners and reduced materials, eighty percent of the iron pipes were not up to standard. The Qianshan construction site office of this company blindly trusted the private merchants and did not conduct a serious inspection when accepting this batch of iron pipes. As a result, the use of substandard iron pipes affected the lifespan of the project contracted by the company, causing losses to the state of about 450 million yuan.
    Second, unsound or unreasonable systems are the biggest loopholes. The No. 1 Steel Material Warehouse of Anshan Iron and Steel Company has not established a spare parts storage system. All spare parts data are scattered everywhere, without a fixed number, and without dedicated management. Moreover, the barbed wire around the warehouse to prevent theft has mostly rotted, and pedestrians can pass through unimpeded. Therefore, the various spare parts in this warehouse have become objects for thieves to steal at will. Wang Weixin alone lured four accomplices to steal more than 200 kilograms of copper wire. This phenomenon has continued for several years, but it has not attracted the attention of the person in charge of the steel material warehouse. In addition to Wang Weixin and others who have been caught, it is impossible to calculate how many thieves have stolen spare parts from the steel material warehouse in recent years. For example, the storage system of the Anshan City Water Company's warehouse is also very unsound. The receipt and delivery of scrap copper and other spare parts are not recorded, and the internal division of labor is flawed. Among the 2,197 kilograms of scrap copper they issued to private merchants, 377 kilograms cannot be found. In addition, because the accounting system of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Refractory Plant was unsound, an accountant named Liu Hanqing embezzled continuously for more than three years without being discovered.
    This phenomenon is even more prominent and serious in state-owned trading departments. For example, the credit sales system of the Anshan City Department Store Wholesale Station is very chaotic. Dozens of bicycles and hundreds of sets of cadre clothing have been defrauded in the name of "credit purchase," and there are still approximately 5 billion yuan in credit sales that have not been recovered, some of which have been overdue for two or three years without being recovered. The reason for this phenomenon is mainly that the staff of this station lack a sense of responsibility and have not established a rigorous credit sales system. The contact with relevant organs, enterprises, and trade unions is not enough. The internal division of labor is unreasonable. Credit sales personnel pay goods upon seeing the official seal (regardless of authenticity), and accountants debit the accounts upon seeing the ticket. As for endorsement and collection, no one cares, and it's over once it's sold on credit. Some staff members of relevant organs, enterprises, especially trade unions, are also very irresponsible when handling credit purchase work. They casually stamp the seal of guarantee without clarifying the situation of the credit purchaser, which also gives bad elements an opportunity to take advantage of. For example, Du Baochang, a fraudster from the Exploration Team of the Geological Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, took the opportunity of employees purchasing wool on credit to obtain a seal of guarantee from the leadership and defrauded three bicycles from the Anshan City Department Store Wholesale Station. Seeing that the relevant personnel of this team did not strictly control official documents and seals, he defrauded eight Diamond brand bicycles from the Anshan City Department Store Wholesale Station in the name of credit purchase of medicines (in fact, the department store does not sell medicines), and further forged an official seal of a certain infrastructure material department and defrauded 194 sets of cadre clothing from the department store wholesale station.
    Third, leading cadres are bureaucratic, lack supervision and inspection, rarely conduct political and ideological education for employees, and do not pay enough attention to safety production, so responsibility accidents often occur. For example, the accident in the welded steel pipe plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company on May 5 last year in which a person was strangled to death by a crane belt was mainly due to the fact that the plant had not established a safety system of "stopping the machine for inspection during shift handover." Some factories and mines have established systems, but they are not seriously implemented. For example, when the employees of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's blast furnace company were building the No. 7 blast furnace, because it was high-altitude work, everyone followed the rule of wearing safety helmets, so no accidents occurred. But later, when repairing the No. 6 blast furnace, many employees did not wear safety helmets, and the leadership did not stop them in time. As a result, worker Bai Fengchi was injured in the head and died after being hit by an iron drill falling from above during work. In addition, Li Baoshan, a worker at the Refractory Plant, out of curiosity, placed two stones on the train tracks to see how the train would crush the stones, which caused the train to vibrate and almost derailed. Of course, Li Baoshan himself should be responsible for this incident, but the leadership's neglect of safety education for employees is also related.
    Based on the above situation, we believe that guaranteeing the country's economic construction from the judicial aspect is not only passively punishing crimes, but also must study the objective reasons for the occurrence and growth of crimes in the process of handling cases, so as to assist state-owned factories and mines in improving their work, plugging loopholes, and achieving the goal of preventing crime. Therefore, when we adjudicate cases of sabotage against national economic construction, in addition to selecting cases with typical educational significance and handling them in a big way to expand the publicity and education of law and discipline, we also reflect the problems we have discovered to relevant departments in various ways as a reference for them to improve their work. Sometimes we raise our opinions to relevant departments at any time after discovering problems during on-site investigations; sometimes we compile the materials we have obtained into written opinions and submit them; for some major and urgent issues, we also personally go to relevant departments to orally present our opinions to their leading comrades. The leaders of relevant factories and mines generally attach great importance to the opinions we put forward and actively lead and urge relevant personnel to improve their work. For example, when we handled the case of Wang Shiying, a worker in the "Waste Utilization" workshop of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Metal Products Factory, who violated labor discipline, we found that some systems in this factory were not reasonable enough. Wang Shiying was newly transferred to work in the "Waste Utilization" workshop. His original salary was 184 points, but because the "Waste Utilization" workshop did not have this level of salary, Wang's salary was reduced to 158 points. At the same time, other workshops in the factory had a reward system, but the "Waste Utilization" workshop did not; and the production was not fixed, and workers were often randomly grabbed to work as odd jobs, so some workers were dissatisfied and did not work with peace of mind, and the workshop's production tasks were often not completed. We believe that Wang Shiying's violation of labor discipline is related to the fact that the factory's production management was not good and some systems were not reasonable enough. The leader of this workshop accepted our suggestion, changed some unreasonable systems, and made a self-criticism to the workers, educated everyone, and improved everyone's political awareness, so the workshop's labor discipline was greatly improved, and production efficiency was also improved. The No. 1 Steel Material Warehouse of Anshan Iron and Steel Company also accepted our suggestion, established a system for unified storage, management, and receipt and delivery of spare parts, repaired the barbed wire, and added a guard, thereby preventing the occurrence of theft incidents.
    Studying the causes of crime through the trial of cases and giving play to the positive role of judicial work in serving the country's economic construction is a work we have just begun, and there are still many areas that need to be improved. According to our preliminary experience, to do this work well, the first thing is to make the adjudicators realize the importance of this work and form the study of the causes of crime into a regular working system. When investigating and trying cases, we should pay attention to collecting materials, analyzing and studying the causes of crime and ways to overcome them, and then submit suggestions to relevant departments through certain procedures. Second, this work should be carried out with a serious and responsible and realistic spirit. Conclusions must be based on sufficient facts, and the suggestions put forward must also be practical and feasible. This requires adjudicators not to simply sit at home and look at materials. In the event of major and difficult cases, they should go deep down to investigate and understand the situation. After the suggestions are put forward, they should also solicit the opinions of relevant departments to see if there are any different opinions, and understand their situation in overcoming shortcomings and improving their work. If the departments that receive these suggestions have no different opinions and ignore them, they should frequently or regularly urge them, and if necessary, they can also urge them to improve their work through procuratorial and supervisory organs.

    审判机关应该主动向有关机关积极提供预防犯罪的建议
    张志恩　李成业　李淑芳
    我们是辽宁省鞍山市人民法院的审判人员，在处理破坏国家经济建设的案件中，我们感到各种犯罪行为的发生，固然说明残余的反革命分子还没有肃清，在国家工作人员中还有一些人沾染了各种不良的思想意识；但是有关国营企业部门和国家机关对这种情况认识不足，没有采取有效措施来预防和打击犯罪，也是一个重要的原因。根据我们对部分案件的分析研究，认为有以下几个问题值得引起有关国营企业部门和国家机关的注意。
    第一，有些国营厂矿企业工作人员思想麻痹，对于破坏行为失掉了应有的警惕，使破坏分子得以乘隙进行犯罪活动。例如鞍山钢铁公司选矿厂的三、四号烧结机环水管的总水门是一个重要的生产部位，总水门的水通过环水管维护烧结机炉体的安全，按照安全生产规程，应该将水门加上铁罩并附锁，由专人负责看管；否则如果水门坏了，一旦断绝了水源，烧结机炉体就会全部烧坏。但是该厂对这样重要的生产设备并未加上安全装置，因而使坏分子符世忠得以乘隙破坏了总水门，环水管一度断绝了水源。幸被职工及时发现抢救，仅将环水管烧漏了，两台烧结机只停止了七分钟，没有造成重大的损失。再如鞍山建筑工程公司曾经委托私商加工八十多吨铁管，因私商偷工减料，有百分之八十的铁管不合规格，这个公司的千山工地办事处盲目相信私商，在验收这批铁管时没有作认真的检查，结果因用了不合规格的铁管而影响了这个公司承包的工程的寿命，给国家造成的损失约有四亿五千多万元。
   第二，制度不健全或不合理是一个最大的漏洞。鞍山钢铁公司第一钢材库没有建立备品保管制度，一切备品资料到处乱放，没有一定的数目，也没有专人管理，而且防盗用的仓库周围的铁丝网已经大部腐烂，行人可以畅通无阻。因此这个库的各种备品就成了盗贼们随意盗取的对象，仅王犯维信一次就拉拢四名共犯盗走了铜线二百多斤。这种现象已经继续好几年了，但是并没有引起钢材库负责人的注意。除了已经捉住的王犯维信等人以外，究竟这几年来有多少个盗贼偷过钢材库的备品，是无法计算的。又如鞍山市自来水公司仓库的保管制度也很不健全，对杂铜等备品的收料和发料都不记账，加上内部分工有毛病，在他们发给私商的两千一百九十七公斤杂铜中，就有三百七十七公斤找不到下落。还有鞍山钢铁公司耐火厂因为会计制度不健全，一个叫刘汉卿的会计连续贪污三年多而没有被发现。
    这种现象在国营贸易部门中更为突出和严重。例如鞍山市百货公司批发站的赊销制度很混乱，先后被人用“赊购”名义骗走了几十辆自行车和几百套干部服，而且还有大约五十多亿元的赊销货款没有收回来，有的已经过了两三年也没有去追缴。产生这种现象的原因，主要是这个站的工作人员责任心差，没有建立起一套严密的赊销制度，同有关机关、企业和工会的联系很不够，内部的分工不合理，赊销人员见公章（不问真伪）就付货，会计员见票就下账，至于对保和催款，就没有人管，赊出去就了事。而有关机关、企业、特别是工会有的工作人员在办理赊购工作时也很不负责，不弄清赊购人的情况就随便盖章担保，同样给了坏分子以可乘之隙。例如鞍山钢铁公司地质处勘察大队的诈骗犯杜宝昌，利用职工赊购毛料的机会骗取领导上为他盖章担保，从鞍山市百货公司批发站骗走了三辆自行车。他看见这个队的有关人员对公文印信的控制很不严格，又以赊购药品为名（实际上百货公司不卖药），骗得工会为他盖章担保，又从鞍山市百货公司批发站骗得钻石牌自行车八辆，并且进一步伪造了一个某基建材料处的公章，骗走了百货公司批发站的干部服一百九十四套。
    第三，领导干部官僚主义，缺乏督促检查，对职工很少进行政治思想教育，对安全生产不够重视，因而责任事故常常发生。例如鞍山钢铁公司焊接钢管厂去年五月五日发生的吊车皮带绞死人的事故，主要原因是厂内没有建立起“交接班时停车检查”的保安制度。有的厂矿虽然建立了制度，但是没有认真执行。例如鞍山钢铁公司高炉公司的职工在修建七高炉时，因为是高空作业，每个人都执行了戴安全帽的规定，因此没有发生事故。但在以后修六高炉时，很多职工就不戴安全帽了，领导上也没有及时制止，结果工人白凤池在作业中被上面掉下来的铁钻子砸伤头部而死。还有耐火厂的工人李宝山，出于好奇心，把两块石头放在火车轨道上，要看火车如何压碎石头，结果引起火车震动，险些脱轨。当然，这件事应由李宝山自己负责，但是领导上忽略了对职工的安全教育也是有关系的。
    根据上述情况，我们认为从司法方面保障国家的经济建设，不仅是消极地惩罚犯罪，而且必须在处理案件的过程中研究发生和助长犯罪的客观原因，借以协助国营厂矿企业改进工作，堵塞漏洞，达到预防犯罪的目的。因此我们在审理破坏国家经济建设案件的时候，除选择有典型教育意义的案件大张旗鼓地处理，借以扩大法纪的宣传教育外，还通过各种方式把我们发现的问题反映给有关部门，作为他们改进工作的参考。有的时候是在就地调查案情发现问题以后，随时向有关部门提出我们的意见；有的时候是把我们得到的材料整理成书面意见提出；有些重大紧急的问题，我们还亲自到有关部门，口头向他们的领导同志提出意见。对于我们提出的意见，有关厂矿企业的领导人一般都很重视，积极领导和督促有关人员改进了工作。例如我们在处理鞍山钢铁公司金属制品厂“利废”车间工人王世英违反劳动纪律案时，发现这厂有些制度不够合理。王世英是新调到“利废”车间工作的，他原来的工资是一百八十四分，因“利废”车间没有这一级工资，就把王的工资降到一百五十八分。同时厂内其他车间都有奖励制度，独“利废”车间没有；而且生产不固定，有时乱抓工人去作勤杂工，因而部分工人有不满情绪，不安心工作，车间的生产任务经常不能完成。我们认为王世英违反劳动纪律是和这个工厂的生产管理工作不好、某些制度不够合理有一定关系的。这个车间的领导人接受我们的建议，改变了某些不合理的制度，并且向职工作了检讨，教育大家，提高了大家的政治觉悟，因而车间的劳动纪律大有改进，生产效率也提高了。鞍山钢铁公司第一钢材库也接受我们的建议，建立了备品统一入库、保管及备品收发制度，修补了铁丝网，增设了一名守卫人员，从而防止了盗窃事件的发生。
    通过审判案件来研究犯罪的原因，发挥司法工作为国家经济建设服务的积极作用，这是我们刚开始的一项工作，还有许多需要改进的地方。根据我们的初步经验，要把这个工作作好，首先是要使审判人员认识到这个工作的重要性，并且把研究犯罪的原因形成一项经常的工作制度。在调查审理案件时，就应该注意收集材料，分析研究犯罪的原因和克服的办法，然后通过一定的手续向有关部门提出建议。第二，应该本着认真负责和实事求是的精神来进行这个工作，作结论都要有充分的事实根据，提出的建议必须也是切实可行的。这就要求审判人员不能单纯坐在家里看材料，遇有重大疑难的案件，应该深入下去调查了解情况。在建议提出后，还应该征求有关部门是否有不同的意见，了解他们克服缺点、改进工作的情况。如果收到这些建议的部门没有不同的意见而又置之不理，应该经常地或定期地催问，必要时还可以通过检察、监察机关来督促他们改进工作。
