In 1954, a large number of new model units and advanced units emerged in state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private factories and mines in Beijing. Among them, 130 attended the Beijing Municipal Labor Model Representative Conference, an increase of 140 percent over the model units that attended the Beijing Municipal Labor Model Representative Conference in 1953. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant selected 77 model units and advanced units this year (including more than 3,200 employees), an increase of 45 over 1953; the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Plant selected 29 model units, an increase of 16 over 1953; and the Tram Company only had two model units in 1953, and 12 model units were selected this year. The number of model units in other enterprises, such as the No. 1 Machine Tool Factory and the Beijing Public Transport Company, has also increased significantly compared with 1953.

The main reason for the increase in these model units is the improvement of the political consciousness of the vast number of employees. In the past year's production, they strengthened unity and promoted the spirit of mutual assistance and love. All the employees of the coal washing section of the second shift of the coal washing workshop of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant gave full play to the spirit of collectivism in production. In the 18 competition evaluations in 1954, they won 10 times. They also jointly studied and improved operating techniques, saving a lot of wealth for the country. All the employees of the turbine workshop of the Shijingshan Power Plant united together throughout the year and actively carried out labor competitions. Since the factory launched the workshop competition in July last year, they have won consecutively for four months, creating a new record of no personal or equipment accidents in 254 days, and ensuring quality in all large and small repairs. In the past year, a total of 65 labor models, advanced producers, and young production activists have emerged in this workshop. The workers in this workshop all realize that only by giving play to collective strength can production be improved. They actively promoted the one-chief system, implemented various rules and regulations, and strengthened technical management, which brought a new production order to the entire workshop. They also conscientiously implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts, overcame the defects of the failure of the circuit breaker and oil spilling of a certain machine, and used the advanced experience of the full-speed three-point method to find dynamic balance, shortening the overhaul date of a certain machine by ten days, which played a role in ensuring the completion and over-fulfillment of production tasks by factories and mines in the city.

    北京市去年出现大批模范单位
    北京市各国营、地方国营、公私合营厂矿在一九五四年涌现出很多新的模范单位和先进单位。其中出席全市劳动模范代表大会的就有一百三十个，比一九五三年出席北京市劳动模范代表大会的模范单位增加了百分之一百四十。石景山钢铁厂今年评选出模范单位和先进单位七十七个（包括三千二百多职工），比一九五三年增加了四十五个；北京农业机械厂评选出二十九个模范单位，比一九五三年增加了十六个，电车公司在一九五三年只有两个模范单位，今年评选出十二个模范单位。其它如第一机床厂、北京市公共汽车公司等企业的模范单位，也比一九五三年增加了很多。
    这些模范单位增多的主要原因是广大职工政治觉悟的提高，他们在一年的生产中，加强了团结，发扬了互助互爱的精神。石景山钢铁厂洗煤车间二班洗煤工段的全体职工，在生产中充分发挥了集体主义的精神，在一九五四年十八次竞赛评比中，得到十次优胜，他们还共同研究和改进了操作技术，给国家节约了大量的财富。石景山发电厂汽机车间的全体职工，一年来他们团结在一起，积极开展劳动竞赛，从去年七月份全厂开展车间竞赛以来，连续四个月获得优胜，创造了二百五十四天内没有发生人身事故和设备事故的新纪录，并且在历次的大小检修中都保证了质量。一年来本车间涌现出劳动模范、先进生产者和青年生产积极分子共六十五人。这个车间的工人们都认识到只有发挥集体力量才能搞好生产。他们积极推行一长制，贯彻各种规程制度，加强技术管理，使整个车间出现了新的生产秩序。他们还认真地执行了苏联专家的建议，克服了某号机掉闸器不灵和轴瓦甩油的缺陷，并运用全速三点法找动平衡的先进经验，使某号机的检修日期缩短了十天，对全市各厂矿完成和超额完成生产任务起了保证作用。
