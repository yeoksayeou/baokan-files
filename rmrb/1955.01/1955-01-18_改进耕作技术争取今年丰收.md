Shanxi Agricultural Model Exchanges Experience in Increasing Production

    Recently, all counties in Shanxi Province held agricultural model representative conferences. The purpose of the meetings was to exchange last year's production increase experiences and explore the potential for agricultural production this year.

    In addition to summarizing the situation and problems in implementing the technical guidance program formulated by the Shanxi Provincial People's Government for regional classification, the agricultural model representative conferences in various counties also studied the experiences that are decisive for local production increases. All counties in the Jinnan area summarized cotton cultivation techniques and decided to vigorously promote cotton close planting, pruning, pest and disease control, and promote early maturity techniques this year. Last year, the Jinnan area generally had a seedling shortage of about 10%. This year, it is required to eliminate the seedling shortage. The 3 million mu of cotton fields in the entire area will strive to increase production by more than 15 million jin of ginned cotton. All 4.8 million mu of cotton fields planned for planting in the province will use improved varieties. The expected yield is generally about 10% higher than that of local varieties. After the agricultural model representatives of Ruicheng County exchanged experiences in preventing cotton pests, 33 representatives immediately ordered more than 10,000 jin of 666 and other powders and more than 50 sprayers and dusters from relevant departments.

    The agricultural model representative conferences in more than 40 mountainous counties mainly summarized the experience of combining agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry to ensure increased agricultural production. The experience of comprehensively planning the long-term construction of mountainous areas in Pingshun County will be promoted throughout the province. It is estimated that by 1957, grain output in mountainous areas will increase by 23% compared with 1952, cotton output will increase by 53%, and oil crop output will increase by more than 70%. The counties in the Jinxi Northwest mountainous area, where cultivation is extensive, summarized the experience of repairing terraced fields and increasing fertilizer application, and planned to increase the planting of high-yielding crops such as potatoes and corn to increase the income of farmers in mountainous areas. Some counties also studied the experience of preventing potato rot disease.

    The agricultural model representative conferences in various counties also studied this year's technical reform measures and promotion methods. Licheng, Luan, Jincheng, and other counties organized agricultural model representatives to visit the "Agricultural Technology Reform Exhibition" and high-yield state-owned farms, and discussed specific issues such as winter production and improving the labor organization and financial management of agricultural production cooperatives.

Jiangxi Formulates Production Increase Plans According to Local Conditions

    Jiangxi Province is currently formulating specific plans for implementing the "Three Transformations" (transforming single-season rice into double-season rice, transforming dry land into paddy fields, and transforming medium rice into early rice) this year to increase grain production, and is actively carrying out various preparations.

    The CCP Ji'an Local Committee has issued a call requiring that the area of cultivated land in the Ji'an area that implements the "Three Transformations" this year reach 500,000 mu. Ji'an County has now set a plan for the county to transform 40,000 mu of single-season rice into double-season rice, transform 15,000 mu of medium rice into early rice, and transform 2,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields this year. Many agricultural production cooperatives in Ji'an, Xingan, Taihe, Suichuan, and other counties have formulated plans to implement the "Three Transformations" this year. The Gannan Administrative Region plans to implement the "Three Transformations" on a total of about 260,000 mu of cultivated land this year, and is now actively conducting investigations and research.

    At present, farmers in various parts of Jiangxi Province are actively preparing for the implementation of the "Three Transformations" this year by building water conservancy projects, accumulating fertilizer, and summarizing and disseminating technical experience. The working groups composed of the Rural Work Department of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government Agricultural Department have written a report on the successful experience of Gao'an County in expanding the planting of double-season rice on a large scale in 1954 for reference by all parts of the province.

Hunan Will Increase Planting of Double-Season Rice by More Than One Million Mu

    Hunan Province has fertile soil, a mild climate, and abundant rainfall. Many areas are suitable for planting double-season rice. In areas where double-season rice is planted, the yield per mu is generally about 200 jin higher than that of single-season rice. This year, in order to further strive for increased agricultural production, it is planned to expand the planting of double-season rice by 1.98 million mu. At present, most farmers who plant double-season rice have exchanged for improved varieties. In the Xiangtan and Changde areas, the main double-season rice planting areas, farmers have built more than 20,000 small water conservancy projects. The 14th District of Xiangtan County plans to expand double-season rice by 20,000 mu and has now accumulated more than 1.5 million dan of various fertilizers.

Henan Agricultural Technicians Promote Various Technologies

    After more than 95,000 agricultural technicians trained in various counties in Henan Province returned to their hometowns, they generally promoted the benefits of agricultural technology to farmers and took the lead in promoting it with practical actions. Many townships have established organizations such as technical research associations, technical training stations, and technical promotion networks to strive for increased agricultural production this year. After the agricultural technicians trained in Xuchang, Luoyang, Tangyin, Shangqiu, Anyang, Boai, Suiping and other counties returned to their hometowns, they quickly promoted more than 2,200 double-wheeled double-share plows. In the past, some new-style agricultural implements in Anyang County and other places were not used because farmers did not understand the technology. Now, with the help of technicians, most of these agricultural implements have been put into production. After Xu Jinfeng, a technician from the Zengfumiao Township Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative in Changge County, returned to the cooperative, she promoted the benefits of accumulating grass ash and urine to the members. The entire cooperative accumulated more than 4,000 jin of grass ash in ten days, and each household also built tiled urn-style latrines to store manure and urine. In order to protect draught animals, four agricultural production cooperatives in Zhangdian Town, Suiping County, adopted the method of soaking beans in warm water to feed livestock (in the past, they used to soak beans in cold water) under the promotion of technicians. Many counties have also promoted the methods of "three diligences," "three fixings," and "five cleans" (that is, diligent feeding, diligent drinking, diligent bedding, fixed food, fixed quantity, fixed quality, and clean grass, clean feed, clean water, clean trough, and clean bedding) to improve the health of draught animals.

Heilongjiang Will Expand the Use of New-Style Agricultural Implements

    Since Heilongjiang Province began to promote new-style animal-powered agricultural implements in 1950, the area of crops cultivated and harvested by organized farmers using new-style animal-powered agricultural implements has increased year by year. In this year's spring plowing, new-style animal-powered agricultural implements will be used to cultivate about 400,000 hectares (about 6 million mu) of land. At present, the supply and marketing cooperative departments in various places are distributing the 7,060 sets of new-style animal-powered agricultural implements planned for promotion this year to farmers. More than 17,000 plows, more than 4,500 sowing machines, and thousands of disc harrows, compactors, harvesters, etc. have been distributed to farmers. In order to ensure that these new agricultural implements are used well, the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government Agricultural Department trained more than 800 technical backbones at the end of last year. Various counties are training cadres from technical promotion stations. During this year's spring plowing, various localities will also train more than 48,000 farmer-tool operators through agricultural technology promotion stations. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    改进耕作技术争取今年丰收
    山西农业模范交流增产经验
    最近，山西省各县都召开了一次农业丰产模范代表会议。会议目的是：交流去年的增产经验，挖掘今年农业生产潜力。
    各县农业丰产模范代表会议除总结了贯彻山西省人民政府制订的分区分类进行技术指导方案的情况和问题外，还分别研究了对当地增产有决定意义的经验。晋南专区各县都总结了棉花栽培技术经验，决定今年大力推广棉花密植、整枝、防治病虫害和促进棉桃早熟的技术。去年晋南专区各县棉花一般缺苗在百分之十左右，今年要求消除缺苗现象，全专区三百万亩棉田争取增产一千五百多万斤皮棉。全省计划播种的四百八十万亩棉田将全部采用良种。预计产量一般可比土种增加百分之十左右。芮城县农业丰产模范代表交流防治棉花虫害经验后，立即有三十三个代表向有关部门订购了六六六等药粉一万多斤，喷雾器、喷粉器五十多架。
    四十多个山区县的农业丰产模范代表会议主要总结了农、林、牧结合发展，保证农业增产的经验。平顺县全面规划长期建设山区的经验将在全省推广。预计山区粮食产量到一九五七年可比一九五二年提高百分之二十三，棉花产量可提高百分之五十三，油料产量可提高百分之七十以上。耕作粗放的晋西北山区各县总结了整修梯田、增施肥料等经验，并计划增植薯类、玉米等高产量作物，以增加山区农民收入。有些县还研究了防治马铃薯腐烂病的经验。
    各县农业丰产模范代表会议还研究了今年的技术改革措施和推广方法。黎城、潞安、晋城等县组织农业丰产模范代表参观了“农业技术改革展览会”和丰产的国营农场，并座谈了冬季生产和改进农业生产合作社劳动组织、财务管理等具体问题。
    江西因地制宜制订增产计划
    江西省各地最近正在制订今年实行“三变”（变单季稻为双季稻，变旱地为水田，变中稻为早稻）以增产粮食的具体计划，并积极进行各项准备工作。
    中共吉安地方委员会已经发出号召，要求吉安地区各县今年实行“三变”的耕地面积达到五十万亩。吉安县现已订出了全县今年变四万亩单季稻为双季稻、变一万五千亩中稻为早稻、变两千亩旱地为水田的计划。吉安、新淦、泰和、遂川等县有许多农业生产合作社，都订出了今年实行“三变”的计划。赣南行政区今年准备实行“三变”的耕地面积共有二十六万亩左右，现在正在积极进行调查研究工作。
    现在，江西省各地农民正从兴修水利、积肥、总结和传播技术经验等方面积极地为今年实行“三变”作准备。中共江西省委员会农村工作部和江西省人民政府农业厅等单位组成的工作组，经过实地调查，已经把高安县一九五四年大面积扩种双季稻成功的经验写成报告，供全省各地参考。
    湖南将增植双季稻一百多万亩
    湖南省土壤肥沃，气候温和，雨量充足，许多地区适宜种植双季稻。各地种植双季稻的，一般比种植单季稻每亩增产二百斤左右。今年为进一步争取农业增产，计划扩大种植双季稻一百九十八万亩。现在，各地种植双季稻的农民大多兑换了良种。在双季稻主要种植区湘潭、常德两专区，农民已修好两万多处小型水利工程。湘潭县第十四区计划扩大双季稻两万亩，现已积各种肥料一百五十多万担。
    河南农业技术员推广各种技术
    河南省各县训练的九万五千多个农业技术员回乡后，普遍向农民宣传了农业技术的好处，并以实际行动带头推广。很多乡已建立起技术研究会、技术传授站、技术推广网等组织，争取今年农业增产。许昌、洛阳、汤阴、商邱、安阳、博爱、遂平等县训练的农业技术员回乡后，很快就推广了双轮双铧犁二千二百多部。过去安阳县等地有些新式农具因农民不懂技术未被使用，现在有了技术员的帮助，这些农具已大多投入生产。长葛县增福庙乡先进农业生产合作社的技术员许金凤回社后，向社员们宣传了单积草木灰和积尿的好处，全社十天内积草木灰四千多斤，各户还砌了瓦瓮式茅池积贮粪尿。为了保护耕畜，遂平县张店镇的四个农业生产合作社在技术员的宣传下，采用了温水泡豆喂牲口的方法（过去习惯用冷水泡豆）。许多县还推广了“三勤”、“三定”和“五净”（即勤喂、勤饮水、勤垫铺，喂料时定食、定量、定质和草净、料净、水净、槽净、铺净）的方法，以增进耕畜的健康。
    黑龙江将扩大使用新式农具
    黑龙江省从一九五零年开始推广新式畜力农具以来，组织起来的农民使用新式畜力农具耕种的作物面积和收获量逐年增加，今年春耕中又将在四十万公顷左右（六百万亩左右）的土地上使用新式畜力农具耕作。目前，各地供销合作部门正将今年计划推广的七千零六十套新式畜力农具向农民发放。已发到农民手中的有一万七千多部犁、四千五百多部播种机器和数千个圆盘耙、镇压器、收割机等。为了保证把这些新农具使用好，黑龙江省人民政府农业厅去年末又训练了八百多名技术骨干。各县正在训练技术推广站的干部。今年春耕期间，各地还要通过农业技术推广站，再训练四万八千多名农民农具手。　（据新华社讯）
