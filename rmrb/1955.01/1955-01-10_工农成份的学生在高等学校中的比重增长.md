Thanks to the implementation of the policy of "opening the door to workers and peasants," the number of students with worker-peasant backgrounds in national institutions of higher education has increased year by year. In the current academic year (1954-1955), there are more than 258,000 students in national institutions of higher education, of whom students with worker-peasant backgrounds (including children of workers and peasants, and worker-peasant cadres) account for 28.9 percent of the total number of students in all institutions of higher education. In the 1953-1954 academic year, children of workers and peasants accounted for only 21.9 percent of the total. For example, the Department of Mechanical Manufacturing at Tsinghua University only had one worker-peasant class last academic year, but this academic year it has increased to three worker-peasant classes. The Department of Civil Engineering also established a worker-peasant class this academic year.

    工农成份的学生在高等学校中的比重增长
    全国高等学校由于贯彻了“向工农开门”的方针，几年来工农成份的学生人数一年比一年增长。本学年（一九五四—一九五五）全国高等学校共有学生二十五万八千多名，其中工农成份学生（包括工农子弟、工农干部）已占全部高等学校总学生数的百分之二十八点九；而在一九五三—一九五四学年中，工农子弟只占总数的百分之二十一点九。例如，清华大学机械制造系上学年只办了一个工农班，这一学年增加到三个工农班；土木系在这学年也办了一个工农班。
