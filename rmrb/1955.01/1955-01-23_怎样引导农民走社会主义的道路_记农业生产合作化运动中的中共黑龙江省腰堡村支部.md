How to Guide Farmers to Take the Socialist Road
    ——A Record of the CCP Heilongjiang Province Yaobao Village Branch in the Agricultural Production Cooperativization Movement
    Fang Qing, Yu Wenqing, Cao Xixian
    In Heilongjiang Province, Hulan County, close to the north bank of the Songhua River, lies Yaobao Village. This village has 297 households with a total of 868 hectares of land (each hectare equals 10,000 square meters). As early as 1946, three Party members were developed, and a Party小组 (group) was established. In 1948, when the Party was openly established, ten more Party members were developed, and a Party branch was formed. Now, it has grown to 23 Party members. Except for four Party members in the supply and marketing cooperative and the credit cooperative, all others have joined the agricultural production cooperative. Among them, eight serve as the director and deputy director of the cooperative, and six participate in the management committee.
    Since the land reform, this branch has been following the Party's guiding principle of "organizing and developing production," leading farmers to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation. Currently, there are five agricultural production cooperatives in the village. Except for one new rich peasant household, one landlord household, and thirteen non-agricultural households, all farming households have joined the agricultural production cooperative. In addition, a supply and marketing cooperative was jointly established by three nearby villages, and a credit cooperative was jointly established by five villages. With the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, agricultural technology has also been reformed, and agricultural productivity has been improved. The average yield per hectare has reached 4,400 jin (2200 kg), and farmers' lives have been continuously improved. Now, 95% of farmers are living a middle-peasant life. Farmers' collectivist thinking is growing, and their socialist consciousness is continuously improving. One of the main reasons for these achievements is that the Party branch has strengthened political and ideological work.
    Actively Helping Poor Peasants Solve Difficulties
    After the land reform, Yaobao Village shifted to the production movement. At that time, it was simply calling on everyone to produce and not abandon the land. Therefore, the situation of mutual aid teams was that some members would leave after the spring planting. During this period, capitalist tendencies developed greatly among the masses. Moreover, this kind of thinking quickly infiltrated the Party, and some Party members were also hiring laborers and lending money. This situation immediately attracted the attention of the branch.
    In the autumn of 1951, Zhu Wanyou, the branch secretary, went to the county committee training class to study, clarified the two paths of rural economic development, and criticized capitalist tendencies. After returning, he convened a branch committee meeting to convey the information and展开 (begin) a discussion in conjunction with inspecting the thinking of Party members. Wang Xing, a branch committee member,检讨 (self-criticized) his mistake of hiring a long-term laborer and统计 (gathered) statistics on the whole village's buying and selling of land and hiring laborers. Eight households bought land, sixteen households sold land, sixteen households hired laborers, and eighteen households worked as laborers. Song Wanxiang's household hired three long-term laborers and bought four hectares of land. Mu Bin hired one long-term laborer for a month. The branch committee specifically studied this situation and unanimously认为 (believed) that if this situation was allowed to continue, everyone would return to the past where a few people became rich and the majority remained poor. After the meeting, a branch general meeting was immediately convened, where Zhu Wanyou explained the two paths of rural economic development and the Party's guiding principles and policies for organizing farmers, and a discussion was launched.
    After the Party's thinking was unified, they studied how to solve the livelihood problems of the difficult households. Then, a座谈会 (forum) of laborers was convened (with the participation of Party members) to discuss why everyone was still working as laborers. Liu Fa said, "I can't do without working as a laborer. I have no food or clothing, and I don't have oxen to plow the land if I farm on my own." They also discussed whether working as a laborer could lead to a good life. Jin Lianshan, who worked for Mu Bin, said with tears in his eyes, "Who wants to work as a laborer? I eat more and work less from morning till night, but there is no other way." When the meeting turned to solving the production and livelihood difficulties of poor households, branch committee members Chen Cai and Bai Wanjin proposed solving the oxen problem for Liu Fa. Zhu Wanyou immediately offered to lend one shi (approximately 100 kg) of sorghum, and Zhu Wanliang lent five dou (approximately 50 kg) of corn and five dou of millet to solve Liu Fa's food problem. Then, Party member Wu He solved the oxen problem for Jin Lianshan for three hectares of land and lent him enough grain to feed three people. Everyone's difficulties were resolved, and the laborers stopped working as laborers.

    Educating Well-to-do Middle Peasants to Concentrate on Agricultural Production
    In 1952, after settling the laborers and restricting the hiring of laborers, some richer households felt tired and constrained in the mutual aid teams when they exchanged labor, and they could not hire laborers. Therefore, seven households, including Li Xiangcai and Liu Bin, successively bought seven rubber-wheeled carts and no longer wanted to engage in agricultural production, attempting to engage in trading. Li Xiangcai loaded two carts of sorghum and went to Harbin to sell them, and Chen Cai, the village's public security committee member, advised them to sell the grain to the supply and marketing cooperative. Li then went to the home of Zhu Wanyou, the branch secretary, and immediately took out a cigarette and handed it to Zhu Wanyou, saying:
    "Our carts are going to Harbin tomorrow. Don't you want to buy something? Buy whatever you need, it doesn't matter if you have money or not." Zhu Wanyou said, "I don't need to buy anything. What's wrong?" Li Xiangcai said, "We plan to load two carts of grain and go to Harbin, but Chen Cai is blocking us and won't let us go. What do you think we should do..." Zhu Wanyou was not anxious or angry, and slowly said to him, "Who are you going to sell the grain to in Harbin?" Li Xiangcai said, "To the grain stalls." Zhu Wanyou said, "Do the grain stalls make money by selling it to others?" Li Xiangcai said, "What else would they eat?" Zhu Wanyou continued, "Then the people in the city must spend more money to buy grain. If you sell it to our supply and marketing cooperative, they will transport the grain to the city, and the people in the city will not lose out when they buy grain. Think about it: can we help the grain stalls to exploit people?" As soon as Li Xiangcai heard this, he immediately felt that he was wrong and sold the grain to the supply and marketing cooperative. Their activities of reselling grain did not work, and they wanted to use the name of transportation to engage in speculation and profiteering in secret.
    At this time, the branch mobilized them to participate in the mutual aid teams and do a good job in agricultural production. Hao Huijun came up with another trick—he wanted to add a weak horse and twelve hectares of land to the Hao Fa mutual aid team, leaving a rubber-wheeled cart and two good horses to do transportation, paying for labor with money, and exploiting secretly. As a result, this mutual aid team was disrupted by Hao Huijun during the summer hoeing and fell apart.
    Not only Hao Huijun, but the six households with rubber-wheeled carts had also put their land into the agricultural production cooperative, waiting to distribute grain, but they were rushing to do transportation for the supply and marketing cooperative. These mutual aid teams could not manage because there was a lot of land and few people, and it looked like the land was going to be abandoned. After the branch committee studied, on the one hand, it mobilized elementary school students to help hoe the land for a few days, and on the other hand, it discussed with the supply and marketing cooperative that it would be best to use their rubber-wheeled carts for transportation during the slack season so as not to delay production. Coincidentally, at this time, the supply and marketing cooperative decided to buy its own rubber-wheeled carts and deliver grain itself. The rubber-wheeled cart households had no more loopholes to exploit. On the other hand, the branch also thought of many ways to educate them, and finally made these seven households change their认识 (understanding), return to the right path, and concentrate on agricultural production.

    Opposing the Exploitation of Usury
    In the spring of 1952, the branch led the rectification of the mutual aid teams. When discussing who should join which mutual aid team, Men Fa said, "I don't have a grain of grain left, how can I join the team." Everyone asked him, "Where is the grain you harvested?" He said, "Before I could even put it in the warehouse, Liu Fengming took it away." Zhao Desheng said, "I have a lot of debts, and I haven't even found oxen to plow the land." It turned out that he had also borrowed grain from Liu Fengming. Sui Guoxiang also said that he had borrowed grain from Liu Fengming. Therefore, the branch conducted an investigation through Party members and found that more than 20 households had borrowed grain from Liu Fengming, totaling 120 shi, most of which was at an interest rate of 100%. Zhang Shengshi borrowed eight shi and had to repay sixteen shi in the fall, and Zhang Fengjiang borrowed four dou of yellow rice and had to repay eight dou in the fall. At the same time, there were more than 20 other households lending grain and money, and 27 poor households borrowing grain and money. Wang Fu borrowed 1.6 million yuan from Li Xiangcai at a high interest rate.
    This situation aroused the serious警惕 (vigilance) of the branch, and they immediately held a meeting to study how to restrict the rampant activities of usury. Chen Cai, a member of the branch committee, proposed: "The most important thing is to solve the difficulties of poor households. If there are no poor households, no one will borrow grain." Zhu Wanliang, a member of the branch committee, proposed: "The best way is to mobilize Party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and government cadres to help poor households." Zhu Wanyou, the branch secretary, immediately expressed his willingness to lend Gu Wanyou three shi of soybeans and 300 jin (150 kg) of millet. Huang Lizhi, a member of the branch committee, proposed lending Xin Wensheng 800 jin (400 kg) of grain. In this way, seven members of the branch committee solved the production and food difficulties of five poor households. Then, a general meeting of the branch was convened. First, Zhu Wanyou, the branch secretary, explained the situation of usury activities found in the rectification of the mutual aid teams and the difficulties of poor households in joining the teams, and conveyed the opinions of the branch committee on how to oppose the exploitation of usury and help poor households. After that, everyone discussed and studied, so that everyone clarified that to oppose the exploitation of usury, it is necessary to solve the difficulties of poor households. No one should borrow usury, and only in this way can everyone live a prosperous life. This is the responsibility of the Party. Chen Cai said: "We must solve the food and oxen difficulties of poor households and resolutely prevent them from being exploited by usury again." Party member Li Qinghai said: "We must use this method. If poor households do not borrow usury, they will not be able to prosper." Therefore, Party members took the initiative to help poor households solve the difficulties of food, oxen, and participation in mutual aid teams. Party member Yuan Zhide lent Shi Xiufeng two shi of sorghum and was responsible for providing oxen for one hectare of land. Liu Ku solved the oxen problem for Bai Fengzhou for two and a half hectares of land and lent him one shi of food. At this Party member meeting, the difficulties of seven more households were solved. For the remaining fifteen households, branch committee members helped solve them one by one at meetings of the government committee and the Communist Youth League branch. Communist Youth League member Liu Guorong solved Bai Yu's oxen problem and tried hard to persuade his father when he returned home. Armed committee member Tian Guangfeng lent Zhao Desheng 1.6 million yuan. In this way, the difficulties of all 27 poor households in the village were solved, and they were absorbed into the mutual aid teams led by Party members and cadres. Zhang Yonghai, a single man with the poorest living conditions (who used to work for Liu Fengming), also joined the Yu Decai mutual aid team. Therefore, no poor households borrowed usury again.
    Liu Fengming, who lived by lending money, had more than 100 shi of grain in his warehouse, waiting for poor households to borrow from him at high interest rates; but until the spring plowing, no one came to borrow. Because he could not manage it himself, the grain rotted until it "turned red." He said anxiously: "The Communist Party really has a way. In previous years, people would rush to borrow grain and money from me before and after the new year, but this year (March) no one has come to borrow." At this time, the branch decided to mobilize Zhu Wanyou to persuade Liu Fengming to sell the grain. Liu Fengming thought that there was really no other way, so he had to sell the grain to the supply and marketing cooperative.
    "Money can't rot if it's locked in a cabinet. If you don't borrow grain, let's see if you poor fellows can borrow money." Liu Fengming said, looking at his money. Unexpectedly, no one came to borrow money either. For a month, two months, no one came to him, and he felt a little uneasy. At the same time, he was worried that he would not be able to plant the land. In the past, he always hired oxen and casual laborers. At this time, he also saw very clearly that because he did not work himself, the mutual aid team would not let him use oxen, and he could not find anyone to hire as casual laborers. Seeing that the land could not be planted, he realized that there was no other way but to participate in labor.
    At this time, the village also absorbed more than 70 million yuan of farmers' surplus funds and established a credit department in the supply and marketing cooperative, which greatly restricted the territory of usury activities.

    Properly Handling Farmers' Surplus Funds
    In recent years, the movement of mutual aid and cooperation has gradually developed, agricultural cultivation techniques have been continuously improved, and Yaobao Village's agricultural production has achieved continuous harvests. In the winter of 1953, the county party secretary came to publicize the Party's general line in the transition period of the state, and also calculated how much surplus grain they could sell to the state. At this time, it was discovered that the total value of the grain and industrial raw materials they sold to the state as commodities was nearly 1 billion yuan. This number aroused the serious attention of the county party secretary. He immediately led a working group to cooperate with the village branch to investigate two materials: On the one hand, they investigated all the investments of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in production, and on the other hand, they investigated household-by-household the annual living consumption. If the two figures were added together, it would be only about 500 million yuan, and there was no way to find a way out for the remaining 420 million yuan. The county party secretary asked Zhu Wanyou:
    "What do you plan to do with this money?"
    "I haven't thought about it yet." As soon as Zhu Wanyou finished saying this, the shadows of Li Xiangcai, Liu Fengming, and others' speculation and profiteering and usury activities immediately flashed in his mind. Thinking of this, Zhu Wanyou immediately told the county party secretary about these situations, and finally emphasized: "We should spend the money in useful places, and the branch must study it carefully."
    The county party secretary said: "First give your opinion, how do you plan to handle it?"
    "Savings, buying public bonds, expanding the shares of the supply and marketing cooperative..."
    "These are good. The state concentrates the surplus funds and invests them in economic construction. But this is only one aspect, there is another aspect: investing the surplus funds in the long-term construction of agricultural production cooperatives, buying large agricultural tools, and accumulating public property. This is socialist property."
    Then, while widely publicizing the Party's general line in the transition period, the branch arranged the issue of handling farmers' surplus funds as a central task for a short period of time. The branch general meeting immediately made a decision: Turning the leadership's intention to handle surplus funds into the masses' conscious action is the responsibility of every Party member. Once the masses understood the Party's general line in the transition period, they all felt that it was the greatest glory to contribute to the construction of socialism. Therefore, when Zhu Wanyou brought back 10 million yuan of construction bonds from the district, they were snatched up as soon as he arrived at the first agricultural production cooperative. Later, he brought back 30 million yuan of construction bonds to meet the needs of the whole village. Then, people saved 23 million yuan in the bank, and the supply and marketing cooperative expanded its shares by 60 million yuan, expanding from the original credit department to a credit cooperative. Han Lianbi, a demobilized soldier, brought 6 million yuan of production funds from the army. He deposited half in the national bank for long-term savings, and the other half in the village's credit cooperative.
    Later, everyone discussed how to invest the surplus funds in current production. The first agricultural production cooperative proposed to repay all the loans for new-style agricultural tools, buy a large fishing net, buy two horses, and prepare to open up a part of the paddy fields. Other teams and cooperatives also made plans to repay loans and purchase means of production. The whole village also wanted to raise funds to purchase equipment for repairing the river embankment, and also proposed to raise more money to set up a cultural center or library in the village.
    Then, the branch studied how to coordinate the activities of the production cooperative, the supply and marketing cooperative, and the credit cooperative. Finally, it was decided that farmers, with the cooperative or team as the unit, should first put forward the requirements for means of production and means of livelihood, including the quantity and variety. The supply and marketing cooperative should prepare the goods according to the needs of the farmers, so as to achieve planned consumption and planned supply. The supply and marketing cooperative should also guarantee to purchase all agricultural products and sideline products sold by the farmers. At the same time, it is necessary to mobilize farmers to deposit all surplus funds in the credit cooperative, and the credit cooperative should guarantee the funds needed for the production of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams and solve other difficulties of farmers. After consultations among the production cooperative, the supply and marketing cooperative, and the credit cooperative, a combination contract for production, supply, and credit was established on this basis. They called it the "Three Union Contract," closely combining these three forms of cooperation. In this way, it can not only meet all the needs of farmers in production and life, solve all difficulties, and gradually lead farmers onto the socialist road.

    怎样引导农民走社会主义的道路
    ——记农业生产合作化运动中的中共黑龙江省腰堡村支部
    方青  于文清  曹希贤
    在黑龙江省呼兰县紧靠松花江的北岸，有个腰堡村。这个村子有二百九十七户人家，共八百六十八垧地（每垧等于一万平方公尺）。早在一九四六年就发展了三名党员，建立了一个党小组。一九四八年公开建党时，又发展了十名党员，成立了党支部。到现在已经发展到二十三名党员，除供销合作社、信用合作社有四名党员外，其余全部参加农业生产合作社。其中担任社的正副主任的八名，参加管理委员会的六名。
    这个支部在土地改革以后一直遵循着党所指示的“组织起来，发展生产”的方针，领导农民走互助合作的道路。到目前全村一共有五个农业生产合作社，除一户新富农、一户地主和十三户非农业户外，所有农户都参加了农业生产合作社。此外，由附近三个村联合成立了一个供销合作社，五个村联合成立一个信用合作社。随着互助合作运动的发展，同时改革了农业技术，提高了农业生产力，平均每垧地产量达到四千四百斤，因而农民生活也不断得到改善，现在已有百分之九十五的农民过着中农生活。农民的集体主义思想正在成长，社会主义觉悟不断提高。这些成绩的获得，主要原因之一，是党支部加强了政治思想工作的结果。
    积极帮助贫农解决困难
    土地改革以后，腰堡村就转入了生产运动。那时只是单纯号召大家生产，不扔地。因此，互助组的情况是春天插上组，夏、秋便有一部分散伙。这期间，群众中的资本主义倾向有了很大发展。而且这种思想很快侵入了党内，有的党员也在雇工和放债了。这种情况立即引起了支部的注意。
    一九五一年秋收后，支部书记朱万有去县委训练班学习，明确了农村经济发展的两条道路，批判了资本主义倾向。回来后就召开了支委会议，进行传达并结合检查党员的思想展开讨论。支部委员王兴在会上检讨了自己雇长工的错误，并统计了全村买卖土地雇工扛活的情况，有八户买地的，十六户卖地的，十六户雇工的，十八户扛活的。宋万祥一户就雇了三个长工，买了四垧地。穆斌雇了一个长工，一个月工。支委会专门研究了这种情况，一致认为如果让这种情况发展下去，大家还会回到过去少数人发财多数人贫困的道路上去。会后，马上召开了支部大会，由朱万有讲解农村经济发展的两条道路和党引导农民组织起来的方针政策，并展开了讨论。
    党内思想统一以后，就研究如何解决困难户的生活问题，随后便召开了扛活的座谈会（党员参加），讨论大家为什么还扛活？刘发说：“不扛活不行，没吃没穿，自己种地没牛犋。”又讨论扛活能不能过好日子呢？给穆斌扛活的金连山含着眼泪说：“谁愿意扛活？早了晚了的，吃的多啦，干的少啦，没有办法嘛。”会议转到给贫困户解决生产、生活困难时，支部委员陈才、白万金提出给刘发解决牛犋问题，朱万有当时就表示借出一石高粱，朱万良借出五斗苞米、五斗小米，给刘发解决吃粮问题。接着党员吴和给金连山解决三垧地牛犋、并借出三口人的吃粮。每个人的困难都有了解决的办法，扛活的不再扛活了。
    教育富裕中农安心农业生产
    一九五二年，当安置了扛活的，限制了雇工后，有些富裕户在互助组换工，感到挨累，不自由，雇工还雇不着。于是，李向才、刘斌等七户先后买进了七台胶皮车，不想再务农业生产，企图倒腾买卖。李向才拉了两车高粱，往哈尔滨去卖，村上的公安委员陈才劝他们把粮食卖给供销合作社。李便到支部书记朱万有家，一进屋就掏出烟卷递给朱万有说：
  “我们车明天上哈尔滨去，你不买点啥呀？你用什么，买吧，有钱没钱不要紧。”朱万有说：“没啥买的，你们有什么事吧？”李向才说：“我们打算装两车粮，上哈尔滨，陈才堵住不让去，你看怎么办……”朱万有也不着急，也不上火，慢慢跟他说：“你到哈尔滨把粮食卖给谁呢？”李向才说：“卖给粮食摊上。”朱万有说：“粮食摊往外卖，是不是得赚钱？”李向才说：“不赚钱他吃啥？”朱万有又说：“那么，城里的人买粮食就一定得多花钱。若是卖给咱们的供销合作社，由他们把粮运到城里，城里的人们买粮食就不吃亏了。你想：咱们能帮着粮食摊剥削人吗？”李向才一听，立刻感到：自己理屈，就把粮食卖给了供销合作社。他们倒贩粮食的活动行不通了，又想借拉脚为名，暗地里还是投机倒把。
    这时支部动员他们参加互助组，搞好农业生产。郝会君又想出了花招——要将一匹弱马、十二垧地加入郝发互助组，留下一台胶皮车两匹好马拉脚，以钱还工，暗地剥削。结果夏锄时，这个互助组就叫郝会君搅的散伙了。
    不光是郝会君，那六家有胶皮车的，也都已把地入到农业生产合作社里去等着分粮食，自己却抢着给供销合作社拉脚。这几个互助组都因地多人少干不过来，眼看地要撂荒，支委会一研究，一方面发动小学生临时帮助锄了几天地，一面和供销合作社研究，最好在农闲时用他们的胶皮车拉脚，这样不误生产。碰巧这时供销合作社决定自己买胶皮车，自己送粮。胶皮车户再没有空子可钻，另一方面支部也想了很多办法教育他们，终于使这七户改变了认识，归上正道，专务农业生产。
    反对高利贷的剥削
    一九五二年春天，支部领导整顿互助组，在讨论谁参加哪个互助组时，门发说：“我一粒粮食也没有了怎么入组。”大家问他：“你打的粮呢？”他说：“没等整到仓子，就叫刘凤鸣扛去了。”赵德胜说：“我一大堆饥荒，牛犋还没着落呢？”原来他也借了刘凤鸣的粮食。隋国祥也说借了刘凤鸣的粮食。因此支部通过党员进行了调查，发现有二十多户借了刘凤鸣的粮食，总数达一百二十石，多数是大加一的利息。张胜师借八石，到秋还十六石，张凤江借四斗大黄米，到秋还八斗。同时，还有其他放粮放钱的二十余户，借粮借钱的贫困户二十七家。王福就以七分高利借李向才一百六十万元。
    这种情况引起支部的严重警惕，他们立即开会研究，如何限制高利贷的猖狂活动。支部委员陈才提出：“最主要的问题是解决贫困户的困难，没有贫困户就没人借粮了。”支部委员朱万良提出：“最好的办法是动员党团员和政府干部，扶助贫困户。”支部书记朱万有当时就表示愿意借给顾万有三石豆子、三百斤小米，支部委员黄立志提出借给辛文生八百斤谷子，这样，七名支部委员解决了五户贫困户的生产和吃粮的困难。然后召开了支部大会，首先由支部书记朱万有讲解了在整顿互助组中发现高利贷活动情况和贫困户入组的困难，并传达了支部委员会如何讨论反对高利贷剥削，扶助贫困户的意见。之后大家讨论研究，使大家明确了反对高利贷剥削，必须解决贫困户的困难，谁也不借高利贷，也只有这样才能使大家都过富裕生活，这是党的责任。陈才说：“我们一定解决贫困户吃粮和牛犋的困难，坚决不让他们再受高利贷的剥削。”党员李青海说：“就得用这个办法，贫困户不借高利贷，他们就蹦不起来。”因此，党员都主动的帮助贫困户解决吃粮、牛犋和参加互助组的困难。党员远志德借给石秀峰二石高粱，负责一垧地牛犋，刘库给白凤州解决二垧半地牛犋和一石吃粮。在这个党员大会上又解决了七户的困难。还有十五户，由支部委员帮助分别在政府委员会、青年团支部会议上挨家解决。团员刘国荣解决白玉的牛犋，回家努力说服了他的父亲。武装委员田广凤借给赵德胜一百六十万元。就这样解决了全村二十七家贫困户的困难，并吸收他们参加了党员和干部领导的互助组。生活最贫困的独身汉张永海（原给刘凤鸣扛活的）也参加了于德才互助组。因此，贫困户就没有再借高利贷的了。
    依靠放贷过活的刘凤鸣，收到仓子的百余石粮，还等着贫困户用高利向他借贷；可是直到开春种地还没人来借，由于自己管理不过来，粮食烂得“红了眼”。他急的说：“共产党真有办法。往年年前年后人们就抢着向我借粮借钱，今年到这个时候（三月）也没一个来借的了。”支部这时又决定朱万有动员刘凤鸣卖粮。刘凤鸣一想，实在没有别的办法，只得把粮卖给供销合作社。
    “钱锁到柜里，怎么也烂不了，不借粮，看你们穷小子借钱不借。”刘凤鸣看着自己的钱说。没想到钱也没有人来借。一个月，两个月，谁也不来找他，他心里又有点发毛了。同时，他也发愁种不上地，以前都是雇牛犋，叫零工。这时他也看得很清楚，由于他自己不劳动，互助组不给他使用牛犋，叫零工又找不到人，眼看着地也种不上，使他认识到除去参加劳动，再也没有别的路可走。
    就在这个时候，村上同时吸收农民余资七千余万元，在供销合作社内成立了信用部，这就大大限制了高利贷活动的地盘。
    妥善处理农民余资
    几年来，互助合作运动逐渐发展，农业耕作技术不断改善，腰堡村的农业生产获得连续丰收。一九五三年冬，县委书记来宣传党在国家过渡时期的总路线，同时也计算他们有多少余粮可以卖给国家，这时发现他们作为商品卖给国家的粮食和工业原料，总值近十亿元。这个数字引起县委书记的严重注意。他立刻领导工作组配合村支部调查了两个材料：一方面调查了农业生产合作社和互助组在生产上的一切投资，一方面挨家调查全年的生活消费。如果把两个数字加起来，也不过五亿左右，还有四亿二千万元找不到出路。县委书记问朱万有：
      “这笔钱你们打算怎么处理？”
      “还没有想算。”朱万有刚一说完这句话，脑子里马上就闪出了李向才、刘凤鸣等人的投机倒把和放高利贷的活动的影子。朱万有想到这里，立刻对县委书记讲了这些情况，最后又着重说：“应当把钱花到有用的地方，支部得好好研究研究。”
    县委书记说：“先提提你的意见，准备怎么处理？”
    “储蓄、买公债、扩大供销合作社股金……”
    “这是好的。国家把余资集中起来，投到经济建设上去。但这仅仅是一方面，还有另一方面：把余资投到农业生产合作社的长期建设上，买大农具，积累公共财产。这就是社会主义财产。”
    接着，支部在广泛宣传党在过渡时期总路线的时候，把处理农民余资的问题，作为一个短时期的中心工作来安排。支部大会当时就作出决定：把领导上处理余资的意图变成群众的自觉行动，是每一个党员应尽的责任。群众一经了解党在过渡时期的总路线，都感到为建设社会主义出一点力是最大的光荣，因此，当朱万有从区上领来一千万元建设公债券时，刚到第一农业生产合作社就抢光了。以后又拿来三千万元的建设公债券，才满足了全村的要求。接着人们向银行储蓄了二千三百万元，供销合作社扩大股金六千万元，由原信用部扩大为信用合作社。转业军人韩连璧从部队上带来六百万元生产基金，他把一半存到国家银行，长期储蓄；另一半存到村里的信用合作社。
    以后大家又讨论如何把余资投入当前的生产，第一农业生产合作社提出要全部还清新式农具的贷款，买一付大型鱼网，买两匹马，并准备开辟一部分水田。其他组、社也都作出了还贷款和购买生产资料的计划。全村还要集资购买修江坝的器材，还提出多集一些钱在村里设立一个文化站或者图书馆。
    接着支部又研究如何把生产合作社、供销合作社和信用合作社的活动互相配合起来，最后决定农民以社或组为单位事先提出对生产资料和生活资料的要求，包括数量和品种，供销合作社根据农民的需要准备货物，作到计划消费和计划供应。供销合作社还要保证收购农民出售的一切农产品和副业生产品。同时，要发动农民把所有余资都存到信用合作社，信用合作社就要保证农业生产合作社、互助组生产上所需要的资金和解决农民其他方面的困难。经过生产合作社、供销合作社和信用合作社三方面的协商，就在这个基础上建立了生产、供销、信用三方面的结合合同，他们叫作三联合同，把这三种合作形式密切结合起来。这样既能够满足农民生产上和生活上的全部需要，解决全部困难，把农民逐渐引上了社会主义的道路。
