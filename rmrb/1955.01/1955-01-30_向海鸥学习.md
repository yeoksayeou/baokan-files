Learning from the Seagull
By Ni. Biryukov (Soviet Union), published by China Youth Publishing House
By Lin Liu

Opening this long novel based on the life of Lisa Chaikina, a heroine of the Soviet Patriotic War, we are attracted by Katya's (Seagull) noble qualities and brilliant image. Seagull greatly admired Paul's famous saying: "Man's most precious possession is life. Life is given to man only once. A man's life should be lived in such a way that when he looks back on the past, he will not regret wasting his years..." She herself was such a person: although her life was short, it is eternally green. If you read Seagull's story, you will feel that she is a close friend in our life, and also a sister as close as flesh and blood; she is a vibrant, firm, optimistic, brave, resourceful, diligent, and self-sacrificing hero. The youth educated under the Soviet system are such people.

Seagull's most prominent characteristic is her close connection with the people. She loves the people, cares for the people everywhere, is a friend of the masses, and is also an organizer and educator of the masses. She serves the people and the motherland wholeheartedly and serves the great cause of communism. The new life strongly attracts her, she understands that life is good, and the future is even better, she understands the preciousness of the people's happiness and hope; under the leadership of the Party, she works for the welfare of the people with selfless work enthusiasm and heroic struggle.

In peacetime, Seagull's new qualities began to grow from daily labor. When she was working in the reading room, she noticed the demands of the peasants: to understand the "Regulations of Agricultural Labor Cooperatives", to understand the political situation in Abyssinia, and she insisted on asking the district committee secretary to make political reports for the masses. She was able to do the work of the reading room conscientiously and excellently because she understood the far-reaching significance of this ordinary work: because the masses had not received proper education, although the new life was beckoning to the masses, the old life was desperately holding on to their lapels. In the flax cultivation experiment, problems arose, she worked hard to study related agricultural technology books, forgot to go home for five days, found out the problem, but was not sure, and when she saw the flax becoming more and more yellow, she was sad and shed tears. Why did her pain seem to be greater than the pain felt by all the girls in the work team combined? This is because if this experiment failed, the old farming methods would continue for another year, or even more years. This means: it is impossible to help the masses get rid of poverty and embark on the road to prosperity more quickly. She didn't do a good job of serving the masses. Tell me, is there anything more painful than not doing a good job when you put your whole heart into serving the masses? We should understand the significance of our own ordinary work as deeply as Seagull, and do it with all our hearts, so that we can do our work excellently.

To unite the masses, we must always care for the masses, help the masses, and educate the masses. Everyone may encounter a companion like Marusya, right? Seagull quickly sensed that this strange young woman was "troubled by something", and Seagull believed that she would become a member of the Communist Youth League, although Marusya herself did not believe it at the time. She finally brought Marusya back to the team and became a good comrade. Can we all unite the masses so well, believe in our work so well, and also believe in the masses? Uniting and educating young people is of paramount importance to all members and cadres of the League. She was the secretary of the League district committee, but she was a close friend of the girls in the work team, not a superior; she went deep into the fields with them to check production, and through this daily production work, she strengthened the friendship and unity between the two work teams and educated the girls. In this work, it showed that Seagull's thoughts and feelings were connected with the young people around her, she cared deeply for them and progressed with them.

The work in the rear during the Patriotic War further tempered this young girl. The task in the rear at that time was arduous and difficult: most of the men in the district had gone to the front and to build defense works, the crops were ripe, there were not enough tractors, and there was a shortage of fuel, it was really difficult! We saw Seagull tirelessly running from collective farm to collective farm. People were all in the fields, and the crops were not finished, and people were thinking: "We can hold on", "We must hold on!" At this time, the Party wanted to mobilize two hundred people, and the Communist Youth League organization wanted to pick the best people to build fortifications, because the enemy was bypassing Moscow. Seagull drew two hundred girls, one hundred and thirty from the fields, one person's work was worth five people's, all were the best, and organized the Communist Youth League labor company. "Wherever the Party needs to place us, we will stand there." Seagull was such a loyal and strong-willed person! We also saw how Seagull was tempered in life time and time again in these difficult days. Seagull led the Young Pioneers who went to the fields to the side of the road where a large number of refugees were retreating, stopped the refugees, and asked the refugees to help them harvest. The suffering of the refugees was profound, and they did not listen to her at first. Although Seagull's words were correct, the wheat was for the front, and without it, tanks could not be built. It was completely right to rely on one's own people and ask the refugees for help. But how could she regard the suffering refugees as "outsiders", "people without conscience". Only by truly believing in the people and caring for the people, could Seagull excitedly repent: "To doubt the people who are as close as flesh and blood!" The refugees did come back in the end. What a beneficial education this is! We believe in ourselves, everything for the motherland, for the people, we must believe in the people even more: at any time, under any circumstances, the people are beyond doubt, the people will always encourage and support us, the people will always be the source of our infinite strength; at any time, under any circumstances, we must rely on the people and believe in the people in our work, so that we can do things well for the people.

In the struggle against the enemy, Seagull excellently demonstrated the fine qualities of serving the masses, relying on the masses, caring for the masses, and self-sacrifice. She said: "...If I could stop the devils with my whole life, would I hesitate for a moment?" She learned "the science of being good at making her heart as hard as iron," and endured the painful blow of her lover being arrested by the enemy. She often cared about the experiences of the masses in the enemy-occupied areas, regarded the suffering of the masses as her own suffering, and turned it into the power of heroic struggle. The people in the enemy-occupied areas asked the guerrillas to tell them about the battle situation near Moscow. At that time, the enemy spread rumors everywhere, dreaming of undermining the people's confidence and courage. In order to meet the needs of the people, encourage the people's fighting strength and organize the masses to go to the forests to persist in the struggle, Seagull personally took on the role of a female herald spreading Stalin's voice. The beautiful legend of the female herald - Stalin's daughter, spread wider and wider, became the hope of the masses, lit up the people's hearts like a torch, and encouraged the people's fighting will, and people kept going to the forests to the guerrillas. The story in the book about Seagull getting on Semyon's carriage is a very excellent poem. Semyon did not know that the girl who got on his car halfway was the female herald, he told her the story of the female herald, he sang happily, telling her: after listening to the female herald's words, people became warriors! He said that she was sent by Stalin, was Stalin's daughter, he told her the words Stalin said to her, saying that Stalin wanted to know: "Does she have the strength to cross the hell threshold of the German devils and rush straight through this hell." This beautiful legend that has penetrated into the hearts of the people is precisely the people's high praise and best reward for their own daughter - Seagull. Whoever serves the people with ten thousand points of loyalty, the people will answer with a hundred times, a thousand times the enthusiasm.

Seagull's arrest was the most serious and highest degree of struggle she faced. Her steadfastness, unyieldingness, and generous and righteous noble qualities showed her high love for the people. When she was first arrested, she shed tears, not for herself, but for the people who were in the thick smoke and fire, the old, the weak, women and children under rifles and submachine guns. Before the execution, we clearly saw her standing with her head held high, wearing a blood-stained, torn undershirt that was stuck to her flesh, shouting loudly: "Folks, compatriots...Stalin is coming to us!...The Red Army is coming!...Victory is coming!..." This voice was the voice of the female herald that made the enemy terrified, and it was the voice that encouraged the people. The people on the execution ground suddenly woke up and rioted... Until the moment of sacrifice, Seagull and the people were connected by blood and flesh. "Katya's Night" was the time when the struggle and victory of the guerrillas and the people unfolded, and it was also the time when Seagull's spirit rose to the highest degree.

"Life is good, it should be lived well!" Seagull liked this kind of poetry, and for the beautiful life of the people, she went through arduous struggles and contributed all her strength. Being able to do everything for the people means being able to be brave, firm, resourceful, diligent, and self-sacrificing. Seagull is a good daughter of the Party and the people. How could a person like Seagull die?

Young people, be a person like Seagull.

    向海鸥学习
    苏联尼·比留柯夫著  中国青年出版社出版
    林流
    翻开这本以苏联卫国战争时期的女英雄丽莎·蔡金娜的生平事迹为基础写成的长篇小说，我们被卡佳（海鸥）的崇高品质和光辉形象吸引住了。海鸥非常欢喜保尔的名言：“人最宝贵的东西是生命。生命属于人只有一次。一个人的生命是应当这样度过的：当他回首往事的时候，他不会因为虚度年华而悔恨……”她自己就是这样的人：生命虽短，却万古长青。你读一读海鸥的故事，就会感觉到：她是我们生活中亲近的朋友，也是我们亲如骨肉的姊妹；她是朝气勃勃、坚定乐观、勇敢机智、勤勤恳恳、自我牺牲的英雄。苏维埃制度下教养出来的青年就是这样的人。
    海鸥的最突出的特点，就是她和人民的密切联系。她热爱人民，处处关怀人民，是群众的朋友，又是群众的组织者和教育者。她全心全意为人民和祖国服务，为共产主义的伟大事业服务。新的生活强烈地吸引住她，她懂得生活是好的，未来是更好的，她懂得珍贵人民的幸福和希望；她在党的领导下，以忘我的工作热情和英勇的斗争为人民谋福利。
    在和平时期，从日常劳动中，海鸥的新的品质就开始生长。她做阅览室的工作，注意到了庄稼人们的要求：要了解“农业劳动组合章程”，要了解阿比西尼亚的政治形势，她坚持着要求区委书记去替群众作政治报告。她所以能认真、出色地做好阅览室的工作，是因为她了解了这个平凡的工作的深远意义：由于群众没有受到适当的教育，虽然新生活已向群众招手，而旧生活却死命揪住他们的衣襟不放。在培植亚麻的实验中，发生了问题，她拚命用功钻研有关的农业技术书籍，五天忘记了回家，找出了问题所在，又不敢断定，看到亚麻越来越黄，就痛苦得流泪。为什么她的痛苦似乎比工作队里所有的姑娘们感到的痛苦加在一起还要大呢？这是因为如果这一实验垮台了，旧的耕作方法会再继续一年，甚至更多年。这就是说：不能帮助群众较快地摆脱穷困、走上富裕的道路。替群众办事没有办好啊。你说，拿整个心去替群众办事，却没有办好，还有比这个再痛苦的事情吗？我们应该像海鸥一样，深刻了解自己本身平凡工作的意义，以全部心意去做，才能出色地做好工作。
    要团结群众，就得经常关心群众，帮助群众，教育群众。谁都可能像海鸥一样，会碰到玛露霞那样的同伴的吧？海鸥很快地感觉到了这个陌生女青年“有什么事犯愁”了，海鸥相信她会成为一个共青团员的，虽然玛露霞当时自己还不大相信自己。她到底使玛露霞归了队，成为一个好同志。我们是不是都能这么好地团结群众，这么好地相信自己的工作、也相信群众呢？团结教育青年，对于全体团员和团的干部有头等重要意义。她做团区委书记，却是工作队中姑娘们的知心朋友，而不是上司；和她们一起深入田内去检查生产，通过这日常生产工作，加强了两个工作队之间的友谊和团结，教育了姑娘们。在这一工作中，显示了海鸥和她周围的年青人的思想感情是连结着的，她深切地关心她们，同她们一起进步。
    卫国战争中后方的工作，进一步地锻炼着这个青年姑娘。当时的后方任务是艰巨、困难的：区里的男子大都上了前方和修防御工事去了，庄稼熟了，拖拉机不够，燃料又不足，真是困难啊！我们看到海鸥不知疲倦地从这个集体农庄奔走到那个集体农庄。人们都到了地里，庄稼老割不完，而人们都这样想：“我们顶得住”，“不能不顶住！”在这时候，党要动员两百人，要共青团组织挑最优秀的人，去建筑工事，因为敌人正绕道进犯莫斯科。海鸥抽调了两百名姑娘，一百三十名是从田间抽来的，一个人的工作顶得上五个人的，全是最优秀的，组织了共青团劳动连。“党需要把我们摆在哪儿，我们就会在那儿屹立着。”海鸥就是这样忠心耿耿、意志坚强的人！我们也看到在这些艰苦的日子里，海鸥怎么一次次地在生活中受到锻炼。海鸥把下地的少先队员们带到大批难民撤退的大路边，拦住难民，请求难民帮助他们收割。难民的苦痛是深重的，一时没有听从她的话。海鸥的话虽然不错，麦子是给前方的，没有它造不出坦克的，依靠自己的人，请难民帮助，这是完全对的。可是她怎么能够把受苦的难民看成“外人”、“没有良心的人”呢。只有真正相信人民、体贴人民，海鸥才能激动地反悔：“竟怀疑起亲似骨肉的人民来！”到底难民们是回来了。这是多么有益的教育！我们相信自己，一切为了祖国，为了人民，就一定更要相信人民：任何时候，任何情况下，人民是无可怀疑的，人民永远是会鼓舞和支持我们，人民永远是我们无穷力量的泉源；任何时候，任何情况下，我们进行工作，都要依靠人民、相信人民，才能替人民办好事情。
    在对敌斗争中，海鸥出色地表现了为了群众，依靠群众，关心群众和自我牺牲的优秀品质。她说：“……如果用我整个生命能阻挡住鬼子，难道我会迟疑一下吗？”她学习“善于使心肠像铁一样硬的科学”，忍受住自己爱人被敌人逮捕的沉痛打击。她经常关心着在敌占地区群众的遭遇，把群众的苦痛当作自己的苦痛，把它化成为英勇斗争的力量。敌占地区的人民要求游击队告诉他们莫斯科附近的战况。而当时敌人到处造谣，梦想打击人民的信心和勇气。为了满足人民的要求、鼓舞人民的斗争力量和组织群众到森林里坚持斗争，海鸥亲自担任起传播斯大林的声音的女报信人。女报信人——斯大林的女儿的美丽传说，越传越广，成为群众的希望，像火把一样点亮了人民的心，鼓舞了人民的斗争意志，人们不断往森林到游击队里去了。书中描写海鸥搭上了谢苗的马车的故事是一段非常出色的诗。谢苗不知道半路搭上他车的姑娘就是女报信人，他对她讲述女报信人的故事，他快活得唱歌，告诉她：听了女报信人的话，人变成了勇士！他说她是斯大林派来的，是斯大林的女儿，他告诉她斯大林对她讲的话，说是斯大林要知道：“她是不是有力量跨过德国鬼子的地狱门槛，横冲直闯走遍这地狱呢。”这个深入人心的美丽传说，正是人民对自己的女儿——海鸥的高度的颂扬，最好的奖赏。谁以万分的忠心替人民办事，人民就以百倍、千倍的热情来回答。
    海鸥的被捕，是她临到了最严重也是最高度的斗争。她的坚定不屈、慷慨就义的高尚品质，表现了高度热爱人民的忠心。她刚被捕时，流下眼泪，不是为了自己，而是为了正在浓烟烈火里的人民，步枪、冲锋枪下的老弱妇孺。临刑前，我们清晰地看见她穿着一件血迹斑斑的、撕破了的、粘着肉体的内衫，昂着头站着，响亮地叫着：“乡亲们、同胞们……斯大林就要到我们这里来了！……红军就要来了！……胜利就要来到了！……”这个声音，就是使得敌人骇怕的女报信人的声音，就是鼓舞人民的声音。刑场上人民忽然惊醒了，骚动起来……。直到牺牲的时候，海鸥和人民是血肉相连的。“卡佳之夜”，是游击队和人民的斗争胜利展开的时候，也是海鸥的精神升到最高度的时候。
    “生活是好的，该好好地生活！”海鸥喜欢这种诗句，她为了人民的美好的生活，经历了艰巨的斗争，贡献出自己全部力量。能够一切为了人民，就能够勇敢、坚定、机智、勤恳和自我牺牲。海鸥是党和人民的好女儿。像海鸥这样的人，怎么会死呢？
    青年们，做一个像海鸥那样的人吧。
