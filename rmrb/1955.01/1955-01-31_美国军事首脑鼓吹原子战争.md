Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 29th – TASS reported: The United States House of Representatives Armed Services Committee began hearing opinions on the United States' 1956 fiscal year military plan. Secretary of Defense Wilson, speaking at a committee meeting, said that the plan "particularly focuses on utilizing nuclear energy in military operations," and he boasted that the U.S. armed forces had improved their capabilities in atomic weapons.

Wilson said that the U.S. armed forces have now "become the largest army that this country has ever had to maintain for an infinitely long period." Repeating completely fabricated myths about the "communist threat," Wilson said that he could not currently foresee "any significant reductions in the total annual military expenditure of the army or the Department of Defense."

Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Radford, speaking at a committee meeting, shamelessly said that the United States has "reached a situation where atomic weapons are now standard weapons, and the use of these weapons has been fully incorporated into our strategies and tactics."

    美国军事首脑鼓吹原子战争
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社华盛顿二十九日讯：美国众议院军事委员会开始就美国一九五六财政年度的军事计划举行意见听取会。国防部长威尔逊在委员会的一次会议上发言说，这个计划“特别侧重在军事行动方面利用核子能”，他并且吹嘘说，美国武装部队已改进了他们在原子武器方面的能力。
    威尔逊说，美国的武装部队现在已“成为这个国家在无限长的时期中要维持的从未有过的一支最庞大的军队”。威尔逊在重复完全捏造出来的关于“共产党威胁”的神话时说，目前他不能预见到“军队或国防部每年的军事总支出将有任何重大的削减”。
    参谋长联席会议主席雷德福海军上将在委员会的会议上发言时无耻地说，美国已经“到达了这样的情况：原子武器现在是常备武器，而且这些武器的使用已经完全列入我们的战略和战术中。”
