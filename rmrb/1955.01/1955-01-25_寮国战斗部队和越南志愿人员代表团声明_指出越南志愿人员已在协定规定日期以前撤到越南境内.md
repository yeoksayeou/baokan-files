Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 23rd: According to the Vietnam News Agency, Dang Wenxing, the chief representative of the Lao Fighting Units and the Delegation of Vietnamese Volunteers participating in the Lao Joint Ceasefire Commission, recently issued a statement refuting fabricated accusations about the presence of Vietnamese volunteers in Laos. The statement said:

Recently, some messages have been spread alleging that large-scale conflicts have occurred in the northern Lao provinces of Phong Saly and Sam Neua, areas where the Lao Fighting Units are concentrated, between the armed forces of the so-called Royal Army and the Lao Fighting Units and Vietnamese volunteers.

The statement pointed out: All Vietnamese volunteers have correctly and conscientiously implemented the Geneva Armistice Agreement and followed the instructions of the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army, and have withdrawn to Vietnamese territory before the date stipulated for them in the Geneva Agreement. Therefore, it is unfounded to assert that conflicts involving Vietnamese volunteers have occurred in the aforementioned two provinces.

The statement said: In the past, many provisions of the Geneva Armistice Agreement have been implemented through the efforts of both sides and with the assistance of the International Commission. Moreover, on December 3, 1954, the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Laos decided that the Royal Government and the Lao Fighting Units should hold political negotiations. Negotiations based on the statement of the Prime Minister of the Royal Government, Kat Sasorith, on November 25, 1954, and the statement of Prince Souphanouvong, leader of the Lao Fighting Units, on October 28, 1954, will guarantee good prospects for the implementation of the Geneva Armistice Agreement.

The statement expressed confidence that, in the future, both sides will continue to support the method of negotiation and continue to resolve all military and political issues in order to fully implement the various provisions of the Geneva Armistice Agreement.

    寮国战斗部队和越南志愿人员代表团声明
    指出越南志愿人员已在协定规定日期以前撤到越南境内
    【新华社二十四日讯】据越南通讯社河内二十三日讯：参加老挝联合停战委员会的寮国战斗部队和越南志愿人员代表团首席代表邓文性最近发表声明，驳斥关于在老挝有越南志愿人员的捏造的指责。声明说：
    最近有人散布一些消息，硬说在老挝北部寮国战斗部队集结地区丰沙里和桑怒两省中，所谓王国军队的武装部队同寮国战斗部队和越南志愿人员发生了大规模的冲突。
    声明指出：全部越南志愿人员正确地和认真地执行了日内瓦停战协定并遵照了越南人民军总司令部的训令，都已在日内瓦协定给他们规定的日期以前撤到越南境内。因此，硬说在上述两省中发生了有越南志愿人员参加的冲突，是没有根据的。
    声明说：过去，由于双方的努力以及国际委员会的协助，日内瓦停战协定中的许多条款都已经履行了。而且在一九五四年十二月三日，老挝国际监督和监察委员会决定，王国政府和寮国战斗部队应该举行政治谈判。以王国政府首相克特·萨索里斯一九五四年十一月二十五日的声明和寮国战斗部队领袖苏发努冯亲王一九五四年十月二十八日的声明为基础的谈判将保证日内瓦停战协定的执行有良好的希望。
    声明表示相信，在将来，双方将继续支持谈判的方法，继续解决所有的军事和政治问题，以充分履行日内瓦停战协定中的各项条款。
