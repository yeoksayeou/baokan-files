Xinjiang Sheep Grazing on the Hulin Grassland

　　Shortly before New Year's Day, ninety-nine Xinjiang sheep, transported by four vehicles, arrived in Hulin County in eastern Heilongjiang. Among them were "Altai Merino," "Xinjiang Wool-Meat Dual-Purpose Fine-Wool Sheep," as well as various fine-wool sheep unique to Xinjiang. Each of these sheep weighs over 100 kilograms and can produce more than 25 kilograms of wool annually.

　　The Hulin area downstream of the Muling River is a fertile grassland stretching for hundreds of miles, making it a good place to develop agricultural and animal husbandry production. The Ministry of Agriculture has decided that this area will be one of the reclamation areas in Heilongjiang Province. In order to develop excellent sheep breeds, this batch of breeding sheep was specially transported from Xinjiang from afar. (Zhang Chao)

    新疆羊群放牧在虎林草原
    元旦前夕，由四辆汽车装载着的九十九只新疆羊群，到达了黑龙江东部的虎林县。这里，有“阿尔泰美利奴”、“新疆毛肉兼用细毛种羊”以及新疆特产的各种细毛羊。这些羊每只体重约在一百公斤以上，每年能剪毛二十多斤。
    穆棱河下游虎林一带是一片连绵数百里的肥沃草原，是发展农牧业生产的好地方，农业部已决定这里为黑龙江省开垦区之一。为了发展优良羊群，特远道从新疆运来这批种羊。（张超）
