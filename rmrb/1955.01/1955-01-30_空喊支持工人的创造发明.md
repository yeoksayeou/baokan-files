    Empty Slogans of Supporting Workers' Inventions
    Editor,

    Walking into the gate of the Nanshan Electrical and Mechanical Factory of the Hegang Mining Bureau, you can see a coal loading machine model that is rusted beyond recognition. Those familiar with the situation will tell you: this is a design proposed in response to the leadership's call to solve a key production problem in 1954. Unfortunately, this design has been obstructed and unable to receive the necessary testing, and has been left in the open air.

    At the beginning of 1954, Xu Yongzeng, director of the Electrical and Mechanical Department of the Hegang Mining Bureau, called on the electrical and mechanical workers of various mines to find ways to mechanize the coal loading process and improve the existing detonators and automatic sky bridge cages – three key production issues. The workers of various units of the Mining Bureau responded enthusiastically and actively put forward various rationalization proposals.

    At that time, regarding the mechanization of the coal loading process, Nanshan Mine alone proposed six different coal loading machine designs. In March, after a special technical research meeting was convened by the Nanshan Mine Rationalization Proposal Committee for appraisal, the coal loading machine proposed by程恩昌 Cheng Enchang and other electrical and mechanical apprentice technicians was approved for trial production. Engineers and the mine director at the meeting also put forward some modification opinions on this coal loading machine model. The Electrical and Mechanical Department of the Mining Bureau then concentrated and reviewed the designs proposed by various mines, and concluded that程恩昌 Cheng Enchang's design was more reasonable and decided to trial produce it at the Nanshan Electrical and Mechanical Factory. 程恩昌 Cheng Enchang was very happy, he hoped that his creation of sacrificing rest time to make drawings and models could be realized as soon as possible so that workers would no longer have to laboriously load coal with shovels.

    However, the materials could not be supplied by the Business Management Section in time, so the trial production of the coal loading machine did not start quickly. It was not until June that the trial production work started. The electrical and mechanical workshop's Party branch also made a resolution to transfer personnel to process the machine and to test it before July 1st. At the end of June, the test run was indeed carried out as scheduled, but because the backrest wheel was made of waste materials, it was damaged during the coal loading rotation. So, a new backrest wheel was ordered from the Electrical and Mechanical General Factory of the Mining Bureau.

    After the new backrest wheel was made and brought back, the testing work still could not be carried out. The reason for not being able to test was that the motor on the coal loading machine was borrowed and had been taken back. At that time,靖成祖 Jing Chengzhu, the deputy section chief of the Electrical and Mechanical Section of Nanshan Mine, promised to transfer another motor for testing, but this was not resolved until the end of August. The Nanshan Mine Rationalization Proposal Committee reported the situation to the mine director陈学增 Chen Xuezeng, who promised to transfer one within a week, but it was not transferred even after a month. The Mine Rationalization Proposal Committee then sought assistance from the director of the Electrical and Mechanical Department through the Bureau Rationalization Proposal Committee, but the problem could not be solved. The Mine Rationalization Proposal Committee then reported the situation to蕭洗文 Xiao Xiwen, the Party General Branch Secretary of Nanshan Mine, and顾万余 Gu Wanyu and other comrades from the Production Group of the Hegang Municipal Party Committee Office. In October, the Joint Technical Innovation Inspection Team of the Mining Bureau and Nanshan Mine also inspected the matter, but the coal loading machine still cannot be tested because of the lack of a motor.

    It is said that the reason why the problem has been dragging on is that this Soviet-style scraper-type 15-horsepower motor is an import and comes as a complete set with the scraper. Although the leadership has thought about using an ordinary motor to replace it, they have not raised the issue for the original designer and the broad masses of workers to continue studying. The design to solve the key production problems of 1954 has been left until 1955, and no one is still paying attention to it. This situation cannot but suppress the enthusiasm of the workers for creation. The original proposer,程恩昌 Cheng Enchang, said: "I will not make any more suggestions in the future, it is useless to make them!"

    The Electrical and Mechanical Department of the Hegang Mining Bureau is merely shouting slogans of supporting the inventions and creations of the working class, only calling on workers to make suggestions, but not solving specific difficulties. In this way, it is difficult for any creation to succeed!

### 空喊支持工人的创造发明

    空喊支持工人的创造发明编辑同志：
    走进鹤岗矿务局南山机电工厂的大门，你可以看到一台锈得不成样子的装煤机模型。熟悉情况的人会告诉你：这是为了响应领导号召，解决一九五四年生产中的关键课题而提出的一项设计。可惜，这项设计因为遭到阻碍而不能得到应有的试验，就一直搁在露天里。
    一九五四年初，鹤岗矿务局机电处长徐永增号召各矿机电职工想办法解决装煤过程机械化、改进现有放炮器和天桥滚笼自动化三个生产关键课题。矿务局各单位的职工都热烈响应号召，积极提出了各种合理化建议。
    当时，对装煤过程机械化的问题，仅南山一个矿就提出六种不同的装煤机设计。三月份经过南山矿合理化建议委员会召开专门技术研究会议鉴定，通过试做机电见习技术员程恩昌等提出的装煤机；工程师和矿长在会上并对这个装煤机模型提出了一些修改意见。矿务局机电处又把各矿提出的设计集中审查鉴定，结果也认为程恩昌的设计比较合理，决定在南山机电工厂试制。程恩昌很高兴，他盼望自己牺牲休息时间制图做模型的创造能够早日实现，使工人可以不再费劲地用铁锹装煤。
    但是，经理科不能及时供应材料，装煤机也就没有很快开始试制，直到六月份，试制工作才算开始了。机电车间党支部还做出决议，要抽调人员加工，一定在七月一日前试验。六月末，果然如期进行了试车，因为靠背轮是用废料做的，在装煤转动时震坏了。于是又在矿务局机电总厂定做了新靠背轮。
    等新靠背轮做好拿来后，试验工作还是不能进行。不能试验的原因是装煤机上的电动机是借来的，被人家要回去了。当时南山矿机电科副科长靖成祖曾答应另调电动机试验，但是一直拖到八月末也未解决。南山矿合理化建议委员会把情况向矿长陈学增反映，陈矿长答应过一星期调到，结果过了一个月也未调到。矿合理化建议委员会又通过局合理化建议委员会找机电处处长协助解决，还是不能解决问题。矿合理化建议委员会又把情况向南山矿党总支书记萧洗文、鹤岗市委办公室生产组顾万余等同志反映，十月份矿务局和南山矿的技术革新联合检查组也检查了这件事，但是装煤机至今还是因为没有电动机而不能进行试验。
    据说，问题所以一直拖下来是因为这种苏联式括板流子的十五马力电动机是进口货，并且和流子成套来的。领导方面虽然曾想用普通电动机来代替，但是也没有把问题提出来让原设计人和广大职工来继续研究。解决一九五四年生产关键问题的设计一直放到一九五五年，仍然无人过问。这种情况，不能不压抑了职工的创造热情，原建议人程恩昌就说：“今后我再不提建议了，提了也白搭！”
    鹤岗矿务局机电处空喊支持工人阶级发明创造的口号，光号召职工提建议，但是却不解决具体困难，这样什么创造也难得到成功的！
