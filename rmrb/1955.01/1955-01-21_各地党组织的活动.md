    Communist Party Members Take the Lead in Completing Production Tasks
    In January of this year, due to the New Year and Spring Festival holidays, there were few working days. The installation of passenger car bogies, one of the main products of the bogie workshop at the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, had to be completed at a rate of one set per day (a level the workshop had never achieved before). At the same time, the capacity of some equipment was insufficient, such as the drilling machines and planers, which were short by more than 2,000 man-hours compared to the task requirements. This was a critical issue for the workshop. The Communist Party branch of the bogie workshop held a党员大会 (Party Member Congress) on January 3rd, calling on all Party members to motivate the masses, overcome complacency and slackness, and improve attendance. It also urged the vigorous promotion of the Sirov rapid drilling method and the Kolesov rapid tool method to fully utilize the capacity of the drilling machines and planers, and the promotion of Liang Qingfa's machine tool maintenance method to avoid accidents and ensure the breakthrough of quotas. Party members expressed their determination to complete the plan at the meeting, which concluded with the adoption of a resolution to guarantee the fulfillment of January's tasks. After the Party Member Congress, the Party members of Gai Xuewu's group led the workers in their group to exceed the quota on the same day's third shift. Eighteen out of the nineteen members of their group exceeded the new quota.

    Holding a Party Member Representative Meeting to Criticize Pride and Complacency
    The Communist Party Committee of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau机关 (organ) held its second Party Member Representative Meeting at the end of last year. In accordance with the spirit of the Resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, the meeting seriously criticized the pride and complacency of some Party members and cadres. These individuals believed they had a "set" way of working, looked down on others, and thought they had made "contributions" to the Party, seeking fame and status. The meeting pointed out that the growth of this pride and complacency had hindered the further development of the work, and that everyone should conscientiously carry out criticism and self-criticism and wage a struggle against pride and complacency. At the same time, it pointed out that individual cadres also engaged in illegal and disciplinary violations, corruption, and degeneration. In order to satisfy personal enjoyment in life, they even used "convenience" in their work to embezzle and steal public funds and property, and even extort and blackmail the masses. The meeting pointed out that although these phenomena were extremely rare, their nature was extremely bad, had damaged the work of the Party, and affected the relationship between the Party and the masses.
    The meeting believed that the emergence of the above-mentioned pride and complacency, corruption, degeneration, and illegal and disciplinary violations, in addition to the fact that a few people were of poor character and bad elements who had sneaked into the revolutionary ranks, was mainly due to the fact that these comrades were not vigilant against the erosion of bourgeois ideology and the poison of the old society, criticism and self-criticism were not carried out, and the ideological leadership of the机关 (organ) Party Committee was not strong. Finally, the Representative Meeting unanimously passed a resolution on strengthening the ideological leadership of the机关 (organ) Party Committee. (Wei Bomin)

    Strengthening Leadership over Urban Party Organizations
    The Sixth District Committee of the Communist Party of Lishu County, Jilin Province, recently inspected the Party work in urban机关 (organs), factories, and schools. In recent years, due to the District Committee's preoccupation with leading the rural mutual aid and cooperative movement, it had relaxed its leadership over the Party work in urban机关 (organs), factories, schools, and other departments. The Party branches in these units had also long neglected Party building work. For example, some Party members in the taxation department believed: "Tax revenue tasks must be completed, but it doesn't matter if the work of developing Party members is not done well." Some Party members in other units believed: "We can do a good job in our unit even if we don't develop Party members now." Therefore, the work of Party development in these departments had stopped, and some units had not even established Party organizations at all. The District Committee had also done a very poor job in political and ideological education for Party members in these departments. The organizational life of the Party in these departments was also unsound, with some Party members not participating in organizational life for two or three months. Criticism and self-criticism were not carried out, and phenomena such as disunity were also common.
    In order to strengthen the leadership of Party work in urban机关 (organs), the Sixth District Committee of Lishu County decided to earnestly implement the spirit of the Resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, improve the Party Committee system, overcome the shortcomings of neglecting Party work in urban areas, strengthen ideological education for Party members in机关 (organs) and enterprises, strengthen leadership over organizational work, and promptly urge the organizational work department to regularly report to the District Committee on the situation and problems of Party building work. In addition, the District Committee will also regularly convene Party work meetings of urban机关 (organs), factories, and schools to summarize and exchange work experience and improve the work level of Party organizations in these departments.

    Oriented towards Teaching, Oriented towards the Grassroots
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing.
    The Committee of the Communist Party of Beijing Universities recently held a branch work symposium to discuss how to further implement the working principle of "Oriented towards Teaching, Oriented towards the Grassroots." More than 200 representatives of school Party organizations attended this symposium.
    At the symposium, representatives from Renmin University of China, Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Beijing Normal University introduced their work situations and experiences. Representatives from various schools also examined the problems existing in the Party's work in their respective units in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism.
    The symposium finally concluded that the working principle of "Oriented towards Teaching, Oriented towards the Grassroots" is an important link in ensuring the guaranteeing role of Party organizations in teaching work at present. It is very necessary for Party organizations in universities to strengthen the Party's ideological work in conjunction with teaching work. Party organizations in universities should closely contact the school administration, do regular work well, and Party member cadres should also study their professional work well.

    各地党组织的活动
    共产党员带头完成生产任务
    今年一月份因新年和春节放假，工作日很少，大连机车车辆制造工厂台车车间主要产品之一——客车转向架的安装，必须一天出一台（这是车间过去从未达到的水平）。同时有些设备的能力不足，如钻眼床、刨床的能力都比任务要求差两千余工时，这是车间的关键问题。中共台车车间支部，在一月三日召开了党员大会号召全体党员带动群众，克服骄傲松劲情绪，提高出勤率；大力推行西罗夫快速钻眼法和科列索夫快速车刀法，充分发挥钻眼床和刨床的能力；并要推广梁清发护床法，避免事故，保证突破定额。党员们在会上纷纷表示保证完成计划的决心，大会最后通过了保证完成一月份任务的决议。党员大会开过后，在当天的三班，盖学武小组的党员，就带动本小组工人突破了定额。他们小组共十九个人，有十八个人突破了新定额。
    召开党员代表大会批判骄傲自满情绪
    中共北京市公安局机关委员会在去年年底举行了第二次党员代表大会，根据党的七届四中全会决议的精神，严肃地批判了部分党员、干部的骄傲自满情绪。这些人自以为工作有“一套”了，看不起别人，自以为对党有“贡献”，要名誉要地位。大会指出，这种骄傲自满情绪的滋长，已经阻碍了工作的深入开展，大家应当认真开展批评和自我批评，对骄傲自满展开斗争。同时指出了，个别干部还有违法乱纪、腐化堕落行为，为了满足个人生活上的享受，竟利用工作上的“方便”，贪污、盗窃公款、公物，甚至向群众进行敲诈勒索等等。大会指出，这些现象虽是极少数的，但其性质十分恶劣，已损害了党的工作，影响了党和群众的联系。
    大会认为，产生上述骄傲自满情绪及腐化堕落、违法乱纪行为，除少数人是品质恶劣、混入革命队伍中的坏分子外，主要是这些同志对资产阶级思想和旧社会污毒的侵蚀警惕不高，批评和自我批评不开展，机关党委思想领导不强。最后，代表大会一致通过了一项加强机关党委思想领导的决议。（魏博民）
    加强对城镇党组织的领导
    中共吉林梨树县第六区委员会最近检查了城镇机关、工厂、学校党的工作。几年来由于区委忙于领导农村互助合作运动，放松了对城镇机关、工厂、学校等部门党的工作的领导。这些单位党的支部也长期忽视党的建设工作。如税务部门有的党员认为：“税收任务完不成不行，发展党员的工作做不好没啥。”还有的单位党员认为：“我们单位现在不发展党员也可以做好工作。”因此，这些部门中党的发展工作停止了，还有些单位根本没有建立党的组织。区委对这些部门党员的政治思想教育也做得很差。这些部门党的组织生活也不健全，有的党员两三个月没参加组织生活；批评和自我批评不开展，不团结等现象也较普遍。
    为了加强城镇机关党的工作的领导，梨树县六区区委决定要切实地贯彻党的七届四中全会决议的精神，健全党委制，克服忽视城镇党的工作的缺点；加强对机关、企业党员的思想教育，加强对组织工作的领导，及时督促组织工作部门定期向区委汇报党的建设工作的情况和问题。另外，区委会还要定期分别召开城镇机关、工厂、学校党的工作会议，总结交流工作经验，提高这些部门党组织的工作水平。（中共吉林梨树县第六区委员会）
    面向教学，面向基层
    中共北京市高等学校委员会在最近召开了支部工作座谈会，讨论如何进一步贯彻“面向教学、面向基层”的工作方针。参加这次座谈会的有学校党组织的代表二百多人。
    座谈会上，中国人民大学、北京大学、清华大学和北京师范大学等校的代表，分别介绍了他们的工作情况和经验。各校的代表并以批评和自我批评的精神，检查了本单位党的工作中所存在的问题。
    座谈会最后认为：“面向教学、面向基层”的工作方针，是当前提高党组织在教学工作中的保证作用的重要环节。高等学校党组织结合教学工作加强党的思想工作是十分必要的；党组织在高等学校中应该密切同学校行政方面联系，做好经常工作，党员干部并应很好地钻研业务。　　　（新华社）
