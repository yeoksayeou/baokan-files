Training Apprentices in Specialized Crafts

The Beijing Ivory Carving Production Cooperative, Lacquer Carving Production Cooperative, and First Enamel Production Cooperative began training their first batch of apprentices at the beginning of January this year. At the end of last year, these three production cooperatives recruited thirty-two apprentices, all of whom have at least a senior elementary school education, are between the ages of fifteen and eighteen, and are mostly members of the Communist Youth League. The fifteen apprentices of the Ivory Carving Production Cooperative have been studying at the cooperative since January 3rd; of the ten apprentices of the First Enamel Production Cooperative, five started studying on January 4th, and the remaining five will begin studying after the Spring Festival; the seven apprentices of the Lacquer Carving Production Cooperative will also begin studying at the cooperative after the Spring Festival. Each apprentice will receive help from experienced masters during their studies. One master craftsman said: "In the old society, it was 'Teach the apprentice, starve the master,' so the masters were unwilling to teach us their skills properly. Today is different; training the younger generation is our responsibility. We will definitely teach them our techniques without reservation!"

The Beijing Jade Carving Production Cooperative has decided to train eighteen apprentices and is currently recruiting.

    培养特种工艺徒工
    北京市雕刻象牙生产合作社、雕漆生产合作社和第一珐琅生产合作社，自今年一月初起开始培养第一批徒工。去年年底，这三个生产合作社就招收了三十二个徒工，他们都具有高小以上的文化水平，年龄在十五岁至十八岁左右，绝大部分是青年团员。雕刻象牙生产合作社的十五个徒工，已在一月三日起到社学习；第一珐琅生产合作社的十个徒工，有五人已在一月四日开始学习，其余的五个将在春节后开始学习；雕漆生产合作社的七个徒工也将在春节后开始到社学习。学习中每个徒工将取得老师傅的帮助。有一个老师傅说：“在旧社会里是‘教会徒弟，饿死师傅’，因此师傅不愿好好地教我们学手艺。今天不同了，培养年轻的一代是我们的责任。我们一定毫不保留地把技术教给他们！”
    北京市雕刻玉器生产合作社已决定培养徒工十八人，现正在招考中。
