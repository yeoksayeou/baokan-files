The state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private factories and mines in Beijing have concluded the work of universally evaluating labor models for 1954 based on summarizing production in 1954. According to statistics from more than 200 units, 1,982 labor models, 7,485 advanced producers and advanced workers, and a total of 475 model units were selected.

Each unit has rewarded the selected model figures and model units, and selected the most outstanding model figures and model units to attend the city-wide industrial labor model representative conference.

In the evaluation process, each unit took "outstanding production achievements" as the main standard, changing the past situation where not enough attention was paid to production achievements in the evaluation of models. The model figures now selected have outstanding performance in production and work, and most of them have completed and overfulfilled the state production plan on a monthly basis.

Each unit adopted the evaluation method of leadership nomination and mass discussion. First, the administrative leaders of each workshop put forward a list of models based on production performance statistics, competition winning records, and rationalization proposals, then the party, government, labor union, and youth league of each workshop jointly reviewed it, submitted it to the factory-level party, government, labor union, and youth league for research and review, and finally submitted it to the masses for discussion. The broad masses of workers believe that this method of evaluating models is very good, as it can ensure that advanced figures from each unit are put forward in accordance with the requirements of "outstanding production achievements," and will not be deceived by people who are "eloquent" but whose production achievements are not very good.

    北京厂矿企业选出劳动模范
    北京市国营、地方国营、公私合营厂矿企业，在总结一九五四年生产的基础上普遍评选一九五四年劳动模范的工作已经结束。根据二百多个单位的统计，选出劳动模范一千九百八十二人，先进生产者和先进工作者七千四百八十五人，模范单位共四百七十五个。
    各单位对评选出来的模范人物和模范单位都作了奖励，并选拔出最优秀的模范人物和模范单位出席全市工业劳动模范代表大会。
    各单位在评选中，都以“生产成绩突出”为主要标准，改变了过去评模中对生产成绩注意不够的情况。现在评选出来的模范人物，在生产上和工作上都有突出的表现，大部分都是逐月完成和超额完成了国家生产计划。
    各单位都采用了领导提名群众讨论的评选方法。首先是由各车间行政领导上根据生产成绩统计资料、竞赛的优胜纪录和合理化建议提出模范名单，然后由各车间党、政、工、团共同审定，交厂级党、政、工、团进行研究审定，最后交群众讨论。广大职工认为这一评选模范的方法很好，它能保证按照“生产成绩突出”的要求，提出各个单位的先进人物，而不致受“能说会道”而生产成绩并不很好的人的蒙蔽。
