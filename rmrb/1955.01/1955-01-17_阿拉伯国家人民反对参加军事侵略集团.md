Xinhua News Agency, January 14th -- TASS Cairo, January 13th: An editorial in the Egyptian "Republic" newspaper, commenting on the increasingly intensified attempts by the United States and Britain to drag Arab countries into aggressive military blocs, stated that the people of Arab countries fiercely oppose joining any military alliances concluded with Western countries. The newspaper said that the policy of refusing to participate in military blocs "is unanimously supported by the Arab people because it is in line with their interests in peace, freedom, and social and economic well-being."
Xinhua News Agency, January 14th -- TASS Beirut, January 13th: "The Morning News" published a statement by Tabat, Chairman of the Lebanese Peace Committee, on the Turkish-Pakistani agreement and the visit of Turkish Prime Minister Menderes to Arab capitals.
Tabat said: All Lebanese people's organizations believe that the Turkish-Pakistani agreement is a war conspiracy of imperialism, attempting to pave the way for American imperialism to occupy Arab countries, establish economic and military rule in these countries, and turn them into military bases.
Tabat pointed out that if Arab countries joined the aforementioned agreement, it would mean that they participated in the US plan to prepare for a new war (which carries the risk of causing destruction to the people of Arab countries) and restored the occupation of foreign imperialism. The imperialists "are plundering our wealth and trying to deprive the Arabs of their most basic rights to independence and freedom." But the Lebanese people, like the people of other Arab countries, oppose this imperialist war conspiracy.
Referring to the visit of Turkish Prime Minister Menderes to Arab countries, Tabat said that his visit was an attempt to exert political pressure on these countries. He said: "Lebanon's interests require it not to enter into alliances or treaties with imperialist countries, regardless of the form or name these alliances or treaties take."
Xinhua News Agency, January 14th -- TASS Paris, January 13th: Public opinion in Arab countries is increasingly dissatisfied with the United States' propaganda against the interests of Arab countries.
According to a France-Presse correspondent in Cairo, the American film "Sadia," which insulted the dignity of Arab residents in Morocco, was banned from screening in Cairo due to widespread protests by Egyptian newspapers.
The Secretary-General of the Arab League called on the governments of Arab countries to ban the film from being screened in their countries. The special committee established by the Arab League pointed out in its report that the film "Sadia" is anti-Arab in nature, as it "portrays Moroccans as primitives" and as people of inferior races.

    阿拉伯国家人民反对参加军事侵略集团
     【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社开罗十三日讯：埃及“共和国报”的社论在评论美国和英国日益加紧把阿拉伯国家拉入侵略性的军事集团的企图时说，阿拉伯国家的人民激烈反对参加同西方国家缔结的任何军事联盟。这家报纸说，拒绝参加军事集团的政策，“得到阿拉伯人民的一致支持，因为它符合他们的和平、自由以及社会和经济福利的利益”。
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社贝鲁特十三日讯：“晨报”刊载了黎巴嫩和平委员会主席塔伯特就土耳其—巴基斯坦协定和土耳其总理曼德列斯到阿拉伯国家首都访问一事所发表的一篇声明。
    塔伯特说：所有黎巴嫩的人民团体都认为土巴协定是帝国主义的一个战争阴谋，企图为美帝国主义占领阿拉伯国家，在这些国家内建立经济和军事统治，并把它们变为军事基地的阴谋铺平道路。
    塔伯特指出，如果阿拉伯国家参加了上述的协定，就意味着它们参加了美国准备一个新战争（这个战争有使阿拉伯国家人民遭到毁灭的危险）的计划并且恢复了外国帝国主义的占领。帝国主义者“正在掠夺我们的财富和设法剥夺阿拉伯人的最基本的独立和自由的权利”。但是黎巴嫩人民和其他阿拉伯国家的人民一样反对这个帝国主义的战争阴谋。
    塔伯特在谈到土耳其总理曼德列斯到阿拉伯国家进行访问时说，他此行是企图对这些国家施加政治压力。他说：“黎巴嫩的利益要求它不和帝国主义国家订立联盟或条约，不管这些联盟或条约采取什么形式或名义。”
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社巴黎十三日讯：阿拉伯国家舆论界对于美国反对阿拉伯国家利益的宣传日益表示不满。
    据法新社驻开罗记者报道，由于埃及报纸采取广泛的抗议行动，侮辱摩洛哥的阿拉伯居民的尊严的美国影片“萨迪亚”在开罗被禁止放映。
    阿拉伯联盟秘书长号召阿拉伯各国政府禁止这部影片在它们的国家内放映。阿拉伯联盟特别成立的委员会在它的报告中指出：“萨迪亚”这部影片具有反阿拉伯的性质，它“把摩洛哥人描写成原始人”，描写成低劣种族的人民。
