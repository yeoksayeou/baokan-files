    The Field Survey of the State-Run Friendship Farm Has Been Completed
    The field survey and on-site land consolidation work for the State-Run Friendship Farm have been successfully completed. The field survey work for the Friendship Farm began on November 17th of last year. For over fifty days, Soviet experts and Chinese technicians worked together, continuously conducting surveys in blizzards and temperatures of minus thirty degrees Celsius. They conducted systematic and meticulous investigations into various relevant aspects of the site, including topography, soil, plant distribution, water conservancy, and agriculture, and produced charts such as the farm's land use planning design map. Now, the farm's boundaries have been officially determined. The site is 34 kilometers long from east to west and 23.5 kilometers wide from north to south, with a total area of 32,803.58 hectares (of which more than 20,000 hectares are arable land). The Soviet experts and Chinese staff, who successfully completed the field survey of the State-Run Friendship Farm, are carrying the farm's soil, agriculture, water conservancy and other investigative materials and various charts that have been produced, and are departing in batches from Xinglong Town near the site for Harbin. There, they will begin to conduct soil analysis, draw land use maps, write instructions on land use, and design field plans.

    国营友谊农场场地勘测调查工作已完成
    国营友谊农场场地的勘测调查和场间土地整理工作已胜利完成。友谊农场场地的勘测调查工作从去年十一月十七日开始，五十多天来，苏联专家和中国技术人员一起，在大风雪中，在零下三十度的严寒中，不间断地进行了勘测调查工作。他们对场地的地形、土壤、植物分布、水利、农业等各有关方面，进行了系统的细致的调查，并制出农场土地规划设计图等图表。现在，农场的场界已正式确定。场地的东西长三十四公里，南北阔二十三点五公里，总面积为三二、八○三点五八公顷（其中可耕地为二万多公顷）。胜利完成国营友谊农场场地勘测调查工作的苏联专家和中国工作人员携带着有关农场的土壤、农业、水利等各方面调查资料和已制出的各种图表，分批自场地附近的兴隆镇出发赴哈尔滨。在那里，他们将开始进行土壤分析，绘制土地利用图，写出关于土地利用的说明书，和田间规划等设计规划工作。
