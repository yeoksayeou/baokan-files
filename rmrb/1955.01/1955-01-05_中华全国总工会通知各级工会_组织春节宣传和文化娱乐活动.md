Xinhua News Agency, January 4th:

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has issued a notice regarding propaganda work for the Spring Festival period aimed at workers and the masses.

The notice states that in order to encourage workers to complete and overfulfill the 1955 national construction plan with a conscious labor enthusiasm, trade union organizations at all levels should pay attention to carrying out propaganda work among workers during the Spring Festival and organize cultural and recreational activities.

The notice stipulates the following propaganda content:

One: It is necessary to use various forms to carry out current affairs and policy propaganda to workers, so that they understand the hostile policy adopted by the American aggressive bloc and its followers against the Chinese people, and their activities of creating division, preparing for war, and opposing peace throughout the world to strengthen international tension. Workers should understand the unity and growing strength of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and the improvement of our country's international status. Workers must understand that our country must liberate Taiwan, and we firmly oppose the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty." It should be explained that we love peace and point out that only by resolutely resisting aggression can we defend peace. The Chinese working class must maintain a high degree of vigilance at all times and work harder to support the sacred struggle to liberate Taiwan.

Two: Propaganda on the worker-peasant alliance should be carried out, and worker-peasant gatherings should be organized appropriately. It is necessary to further publicize the Party and the state’s policy of socialist transformation of agriculture and its major achievements, so that workers understand the great role of the socialist transformation of agriculture in realizing China's socialist industrialization. It is necessary to further publicize the idea of the worker-peasant alliance, explaining its importance, the relationship of mutual support between workers and peasants, urban and rural areas, industry and agriculture, and the great responsibility of the working class in the socialist transformation of agriculture. To strengthen this propaganda work, trade union organizations at all levels may appropriately organize worker-peasant gatherings according to local conditions.

Three: Organize amateur cultural and artistic activities for workers in a planned way. The forms of activities should be diverse, concise, and lively, and be welcomed by workers.

Four: During the Spring Festival, we should also respond to the government's call to hold gatherings with the families of revolutionary martyrs and the families of revolutionary soldiers, and conduct condolence work for them.

Five: During the Spring Festival, attention should also be paid to carrying out propaganda work among workers and their families to ensure on-time attendance. Families should be informed of the significance of liberating Taiwan, and they should be given enhanced education on the worker-peasant alliance. They should also be widely absorbed and mobilized to participate in cultural and recreational activities.
