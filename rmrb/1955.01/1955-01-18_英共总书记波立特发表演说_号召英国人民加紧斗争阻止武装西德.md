Xinhua News Agency, London, January 17th: According to TASS, Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, delivered a speech at a meeting of Communist Party members in Manchester on the 15th, calling for an intensified struggle against the arming of West Germany.

Pollitt said: "The entire history of the post-war period proves that the Soviet Union has been striving to resolve the German question based on the principles of unanimous agreement among the Allies, and especially according to the agreements reached at the Potsdam Conference."

Referring to the Soviet Union's proposal for the establishment of an all-European collective security system, Pollitt said: Accepting this proposal would end the current state of division in Europe, open the path to a peaceful restoration of German unity and the establishment of a democratic, independent, and peaceful Germany, thereby greatly easing the international situation.

Pollitt continued: On any question concerning the future of Germany or the peace of Europe, the Soviet Union has never failed to put forward constructive and sensible proposals. The basis for resolving every dispute exists, as long as the Western countries are willing to negotiate. Pollitt pointed out that it is the Western countries that are creating obstacles on this path.

Pollitt emphasized that ratifying the Paris Agreements is incompatible with the restoration of German unity. He concluded by stressing that all peace-loving people should unite and fight to prevent the ratification of the Paris Agreements and to prevent the arming of West Germany.

Pollitt delivered a speech at another gathering on the 14th, condemning Western countries for using huge sums of money to develop new destructive weapons.

Taking Britain as an example, Pollitt pointed out that in the current fiscal year, Britain spent a total of 235.8 million pounds on scientific research and development in the military field. However, only 27.1 million pounds were spent on research in civilian undertakings.

Pollitt concluded by pointing out that the struggle for peace and against the rearmament of Germany is a struggle for a better life for the British people.

    号召英国人民加紧斗争阻止武装西德
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国共产党总书记波立特十五日在曼彻斯特共产党党员会议上发表演说，号召加紧进行反对武装西德的斗争。
    波立特说：“战后的全部历史证明，苏联一直在尽力争取根据盟国一致同意的原则，特别是根据波茨坦会议达成的协议，解决德国问题。”
    波立特在谈到苏联关于建立全欧集体安全体系的建议时说：接受这个建议就可以结束欧洲目前的分裂状态，打开通往和平恢复德国统一和建立民主、独立、和平的德国的道路，从而大大缓和国际局势。
    波立特接着说：关于任何有关德国的前途或欧洲的和平的问题，苏联没有一次不提出建设性的和明智的建议。只要西方国家愿意协商，解决每一个争端的基础是存在的。波立特指出：在这条道路上制造障碍的是西方国家。
    波立特着重指出：批准巴黎协定是和恢复德国统一不相容的。他最后强调：凡是爱好和平的人，都应当团结起来，为阻止批准巴黎协定，阻止武装西德而斗争。
    波立特十四日在另一次集会上发表演说，谴责西方国家以巨额经费发展新的毁灭性武器。
    波立特以英国为例，指出在本财政年度中，英国在军事方面的科学研究和发展工作上所花的钱总共达二亿三千五百八十万英镑。而在民用事业的研究工作上，只花了二千七百一十万英镑。
    波立特最后指出：争取和平和反对德国重新武装的斗争就是为英国人民争取比较美好的生活的斗争。
