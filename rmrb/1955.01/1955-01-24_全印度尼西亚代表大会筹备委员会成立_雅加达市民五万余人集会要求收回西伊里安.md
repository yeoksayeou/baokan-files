Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 21st: Indonesia is preparing to convene an All-Indonesia Congress with the participation of various political parties, trade unions, and other organizations. The suggestion to convene the All-Indonesia Congress to strengthen Indonesian national unity was made by President Sukarno at a reception held during the Indonesian Nationalist Party Congress on December 18th last year.

The preparatory committee for the congress was established on the 19th. Currently, participants in this preparatory committee include: Vice Speaker of Parliament Kawe Tanata, Mayor of Jakarta Sudiro, Professor of Jakarta National University and winner of the Stalin International Peace Prize Priyono, Chairman of the Progressive Party Bentaran, Member of Parliament Diapari, General Secretary of the Communist Party Aidit, Chairman of the Indonesian People's Party Sutomo, one of the leaders of the Masyumi Party Ansari, Director of Antara News Agency Malik, and other individuals. The preparatory committee is expected to be expanded in the future.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 21st: More than 50,000 Jakarta citizens held a mass rally on the 16th, demanding national unity and the return of West Irian. The rally demanded that the government declare the Dutch occupation of West Irian an act of aggression and take action against the Netherlands.

The rally was hosted by a youth consultative group composed of students and many political parties.

Member of Parliament Dr. Diapari, in his speech at the rally, said that the Dutch often try to sow seeds of discord among the Indonesian people. The "Republic of South Moluccas" is merely a tool for the Netherlands in implementing its old colonial policies. West Irian is now being used as a base for realizing Dutch aggression. The people of West Irian are fiercely resisting the brutal rule of the Dutch. He said that West Irian must be liberated as soon as possible.

    全印度尼西亚代表大会筹备委员会成立
    雅加达市民五万余人集会要求收回西伊里安
    【新华社雅加达二十一日电】印度尼西亚正在筹备召开印度尼西亚各政党、工会和其他团体参加的全印度尼西亚代表大会。召开全印度尼西亚代表大会以加强印度尼西亚民族团结的建议，是苏加诺总统在去年十二月十八日在印度尼西亚国民党代表大会举行的招待会上提出来的。
    代表大会的筹备委员会已经在十九日宣告成立。目前，参加这个筹备委员会的有：国会副议长卡韦塔纳塔，雅加达市长苏迪罗，雅加达国立大学教授，“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人普里约诺，进步党主席本塔朗，国会议员迪亚帕里，共产党总书记艾地，印度尼西亚人民党主席苏托莫、马斯友美党领袖之一安沙里，安塔拉通讯社社长马利克和其他人士。这个筹备委员会今后还准备加以扩大。
    【新华社雅加达二十一日电】雅加达市民五万余人在十六日举行了群众大会，要求全国团结和收回西伊里安。大会要求政府宣布荷兰占领西伊里安是侵略行为，并对荷兰采取行动。
    大会是在由学生和很多政党组成的青年协商团体主持下举行的。
    国会议员迪亚帕里博士在大会上发表演说时说，荷兰人经常想在印度尼西亚人民中间散布不和的种子。“南摩鹿加共和国”只是荷兰在实行它的旧殖民政策中的一个工具而已。西伊里安现在正被用来作为实现荷兰侵略的根据地。西伊里安人民正在激烈反抗荷兰人的残暴统治。他说，必须尽速解放西伊里安。
