Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 27th: According to a TASS report from Berlin on January 26th, President Wilhelm Pieck of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement on the decree issued by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union regarding the end of the state of war between the Soviet Union and Germany, warmly endorsing the Soviet decision.

President Pieck stated on January 26th during a conversation with a delegation of working people from the Oberhausen Machine and Tractor Station that the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union "provides great assistance to the entire German people." President Pieck said: "Our people should now strive even harder to secure negotiations among the Four Powers with the participation of German representatives on the restoration of German unity; and more resolutely put forward the following demands: oppose military agreements and division, and support a peace treaty and German unity!"

According to reports in Berlin's democratic newspapers, Lothar Bolz, Deputy Chairman of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic and General Secretary of the Christian Democratic Union, also issued a statement saying: "The Soviet decree once again proves that the Soviet government sincerely hopes to establish peaceful relations with a unified Germany, eliminate the state of division and conclude a peace treaty with Germany as quickly as possible."

Berlin's democratic newspapers also published a conversation with Wellmann, Secretary-General of the German Peace Committee. He said: Precisely when the countries of the Atlantic bloc are openly preparing for atomic warfare and attempting to draw West Germany into military preparations, the Soviet Union has once again pointed out the path to salvation. The entire people of East and West Germany should do everything in their power to strive for effective negotiations on the issue of a German peace treaty, and the Soviet decree has opened the door for negotiations. The decree of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has also aroused a favorable reaction in West Germany. The West Berlin evening newspaper "Express" published speeches by Erich Ollenhauer, Chairman of the Social Democratic Party of West Germany, and Reinhold Maier, Chairman of the Free Democratic Party. Ollenhauer welcomed the steps taken by the Soviet Union, saying: "Obviously, this indicates the Soviet Union's attempt to strive for negotiations with the West on the German question." He demanded that the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union be "carefully studied." Maier believed that this new step taken by the Soviet Union was an attempt to create "more favorable conditions" for negotiations between East and West.

    德意志民主共和国总统皮克发表声明
    拥护苏联宣布结束苏德间战争状态的决定
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十六日讯：德意志民主共和国总统威廉·皮克就苏联最高苏维埃主席团发布的关于结束苏联同德国之间的战争状态的命令发表声明，热烈拥护苏联的决定。
    皮克总统二十六日在和奥伯豪森机器拖拉机站劳动人民代表团谈话时声明，苏联最高苏维埃主席团的命令“给予了全德国人民极大的帮助”。皮克总统说：“我国人民现在应当更加努力争取四大国在德国代表参加之下举行关于恢复德国统一的谈判；更加坚决地提出以下要求：反对军事协定和分裂，拥护和约和德国统一！”
    据柏林民主报纸报道，德意志民主共和国人民议院副主席、基督教民主联盟总书记格·戈丁也发表声明说：“苏联的命令又一次证明了，苏联政府非常希望和全德建立和平关系，消除德国的分裂状态和尽速缔结对德和约。”
    柏林的民主报纸还刊载了德国和平委员会总书记卫尔曼发表的谈话。他说：正当大西洋集团国家公开准备原子战争和力图使西德参加军事准备的时候，苏联又一次指出了解救的道路。东西德全体人民应当竭尽全力争取就对德和约问题进行有效的谈判，苏联的命令已经为谈判打开了道路。苏联最高苏维埃的命令也在西德引起良好的反应。西柏林晚报“快报”刊载了西德社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔和自由民主党主席戴勒的讲话。奥伦豪尔欢迎苏联所采取的步骤，他说：“显然，这就表示苏联企图争取和西方就德国问题进行谈判。”他要求“仔细地研究”苏联最高苏维埃主席团的命令。戴勒认为苏联采取的这个新步骤，是力图为东西方之间的谈判造成“更加有利的条件”。
