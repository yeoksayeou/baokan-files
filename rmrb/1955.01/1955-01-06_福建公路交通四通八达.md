Fujian's highway transportation has become accessible in all directions. Last year, the province built and rebuilt over 900 kilometers of highways. Now, three-quarters of the province's counties are accessible by car, with a total of 83 bus routes. Hundreds of vehicles transport thousands of tons of materials and more than 8,000 passengers daily on transportation lines stretching over 3,000 kilometers.

The inconvenient transportation situation in the mountainous areas of Fujian Province has changed. Yong'an, a "mountain city" in northwestern Fujian, has now become a new connecting center for the northern, southern, and western Fujian highways. Ninghua County, the most remote county in the province, is also accessible by car. Six of the seven counties in the Longyan Special District, a revolutionary old base area, are now open to traffic, and Gutian Township, the site of the famous "Gutian Conference," also has a highway. The Lianjiang-Luoyuan section of the highway in northeastern Fujian, which had previously been a dotted line on the map, was also completed and opened to traffic last year. The opening of these highways has connected the mountainous areas with the plains, the coastal areas with the inland areas, allowing the abundant local specialties, minerals, and industrial raw materials of the mountainous areas to be transported out smoothly. Various industrial and handicraft products from the cities can also be transported directly to the mountainous areas.

    福建公路交通四通八达
    福建省公路交通运输已四通八达。去年全省新建和改建了九百多公里长的公路。现在，全省四分之三的县已通汽车，共有班车路线八十三条，每天都有数百辆汽车载运着上千吨物资和八千多名旅客行驶在全长三千多公里的运输线上。
    福建省山区交通不便的情况已有了改变。闽西北“山城”永安现已成为闽北、闽南、闽西三线公路的一个新的联结中心，全省最僻远的县份宁化县也通了汽车。革命老根据地龙岩专区七个县已有六个县通车，有名的“古田会议”所在地——古田乡也有了公路。在地图上一直是条虚线的闽东北连江、罗源段的公路也在去年修好通车。这些公路的通车，已使山区和平原、沿海和内地连接起来，山区的各种富饶的土特产、矿产和工业原料可以源源外运；城市的各种工业品、手工业品也可直接运达山区。
