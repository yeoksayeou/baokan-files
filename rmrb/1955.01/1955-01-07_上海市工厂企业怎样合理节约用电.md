How Shanghai Factories and Enterprises Can Reasonably Save Electricity
Cheng Yan

The Shanghai Electric Power Administration, starting from the first quarter of last year, comprehensively launched a program for rational and economical electricity use in more than 450 major state-owned, joint state-private, and private factories and enterprises in more than ten industries including textiles, printing and dyeing, iron and steel, machinery, paper making, chemicals, shipbuilding, smelting, flour, and rubber in the city of Shanghai. Preliminary achievements have been made. By the end of the third quarter, a total of 32,855,600 kilowatt-hours of electricity had been saved, and more than 20,000 tons of coal for generating this electricity had been saved. At the same time, factories and enterprises reduced electricity expenses by more than 26 billion yuan. In addition, various units dismantled and adjusted surplus power equipment totaling 10,540 horsepower of electric motors and 6,200 kVA of transformers, and cut off 73,000 kVA of transformers during factory holidays. The electricity saved is equivalent to a 9,600 kW generator. This amount of electricity is sufficient to supply six cotton mills with 50,000 spindles each. If the state invested in building such a power generation facility, it would require more than 100 billion yuan and more than three years to put it into production.

Most of the electrical equipment in Shanghai's factories and enterprises is old and in disrepair, lacks operational systems, and is used unreasonably. General electricity waste is more than 8%. In the early stages of promoting electricity conservation, many factories lacked experience and did not know where to start, and they did not fully recognize the significant importance of saving electricity. In response to the above situation, the Shanghai Electric Power Administration, starting in the first half of 1953, selected industries with a large proportion of electricity consumption, such as textiles, printing and dyeing, and papermaking, as key areas. They went deep into factory workshops, starting with specific inspections of electricity consumption in the production process, assisted in identifying waste, and assisted in studying solutions. The actual work results of several pilot factories proved that the serious electricity waste phenomenon in many factories and enterprises in Shanghai could be overcome. For example, the combing and spinning departments of Shenxin No. 5 Factory accounted for 70% of the factory's electricity consumption, but in the past, maintenance work on combing machines and spinning machines only focused on yarn breakage rates, and the waste of electricity was never emphasized. The pilot working group assisted the factory in carrying out key experiments in the spinning and combing sections, reducing the power consumption of combing machines by 20% and the power consumption of spinning machines by 10%. This one measure alone reduced the factory's monthly electricity consumption by 54,000 kWh. In addition, the factory adjusted the excessively large electric motors, promptly switched off the transformer switches when stopping the machines, and reduced the phenomenon of vehicles running idle, which also saved more than 15,000 kWh of electricity per month. If these experiences were推广 promoted to all cotton textile factories in Shanghai, it is estimated that 50 million kWh of electricity could be saved annually.

The facts powerfully educated the cadres of the Shanghai Electric Power Administration, making everyone see the phenomenon of electricity waste and the possibility of saving it, thereby increasing their confidence in promoting electricity conservation work. At the same time, through frequent dispatch of cadres to factories to provide technical assistance, through the training of electricians in electrician training classes, the cultivation of key personnel for electricity conservation, as well as the holding of various industry and type electricity conservation experience exchange meetings, safety electricity use real object photo exhibitions, and the printing of electricity conservation newsletters, the electricity conservation work also began to receive universal attention from factories and enterprises. Many factories and enterprises have successively established specialized teams to lead electricity conservation work or designated special personnel to guide the progress of this work. In particular, the frequent holding of various industry and type electricity conservation experience exchange meetings played a significant role in promoting electricity conservation. The electricity conservation work of the entire private cotton textile industry, Zhongnan Rubber Factory, and Shanghai Flour Factory was launched under the influence of experience exchange meetings. Some factories, although not within the scope of the Shanghai Electric Power Administration's electricity conservation work, also participated in this work. For example, the private Weichang Yarn Factory automatically participated in electricity conservation and reduced the average electricity consumption per bale of yarn by 40 kWh. They also actively cooperated with the Shanghai Electric Power Administration in conducting various electricity conservation tests such as lowering the viscosity of spindle oil.

The facts in many factories have proved that reasonable and economical electricity use is combined with the cost reduction and production technology improvements of the factories and enterprises themselves. For example, since Shenxin No. 5 Factory solved the problem of motor overload starting in the fourth quarter of the year before last, electricity consumption has been greatly reduced, and increased production can proceed smoothly. At present, the factory has saved more than 700,000 kWh of electricity, and the power factor has also increased from 0.65 to 0.75. After adopting the measures of using synthetic resin bearings to replace copper bearings and compacting the calendering process, the Oriental Steel Factory has reduced the electricity consumption per unit product by 21%, increased production by 40%, and also saved a lot of copper for bearings and a large amount of edible oil for lubrication. Over the past year, many factories have achieved similar results.

Although Shanghai's comprehensive promotion of rational and economical electricity use has achieved significant results, the development of this work is still uneven in various factories. According to statistics from 450 factories, more than half of the factories have not achieved any savings. Some of them emphasize that there are many central tasks and they do not have time to work on it. Some believe that electricity is a "small matter" in terms of reducing costs, and they have not realized that it is a major matter from the perspective of the overall national interest; or they isolatedly regard electricity conservation as the business of the electricity sector or electromechanical staff, and it has "nothing to do" with them. Some factories are blindly complacent, thinking that their factory's savings have reached the "top." There are even individual factory leaders who still take a hands-off approach to electricity conservation.

Another important issue in rational and economical electricity use is that although many factories have created a lot of experience, they have failed to further summarize and improve it, promptly promote it in the same industry, or formulate systems to implement it into production plans, so that many units cannot consolidate their existing achievements, and the existing experience is limited to a few factories, making it impossible to further expand savings. For example, in the cotton textile industry system, there are still many units that produce the same product, but the electricity consumption of workshop A is much higher than that of workshop B. Due to lack of systems, or the fact that the systems have not been well implemented, some factories have even restored the electricity consumption situation to its original state.

In order to strengthen the leadership of this work, Shanghai has established an office for saving raw materials (including saving electricity) under the unified leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Committee. The Shanghai factories and various joint state-private factories and some private cotton textile factories under the East China Textile Administration have launched an electricity conservation competition, and many factories have successively formulated future electricity conservation plans in order to further develop the work.

    上海市工厂企业怎样合理节约用电
    成言
    上海电业管理局自去年第一季度起，在全市纺织、印染、钢铁、机械、造纸、化工、造船、冶炼、面粉、橡胶等十余个行业中的四百五十多个主要国营、公私合营及私营工厂企业单位，全面开展合理节约用电工作，获得了初步成绩。到第三季度止，共计节约了三千二百八十五万五千六百多度电，并节省了发出这些电力的燃煤两万多吨，同时使工厂、企业减少电费开支二百六十亿元以上。此外各单位拆除和调整多余的用电设备共有一万零五百四十匹马力的电动机，六千二百多千伏安的变压器，工厂厂休日切断变压器七万三千多千伏安。节省用电相当于九千六百瓩的一部发电机。这些电力足可供应六个五万纱锭纱厂的用电。像这样一套发电设备，如果由国家投资新建，需要一千多亿元的资金，三年多的时间，才能投入生产。
    上海市大多数工厂企业的用电设备都年久失修，操作无制度，使用不合理，一般的电力浪费都在百分之八以上。在开展节约用电的初期，很多工厂对这一工作缺乏经验，不知从何着手，对节约用电的重大意义也认识不足。针对上述情形，上海电业管理局自一九五三年上半年起，选择用电比重较大的纺织、印染、造纸等行业为重点，深入工厂车间，从具体检查生产过程中的用电情形着手，协助查浪费，并协助研究解决办法。几个试点厂的实际工作结果证明：上海很多工厂、企业严重的用电浪费现象是能够克服的。如申新五厂的梳棉和精纺二部，占全厂用电百分之七十，但过去对梳棉机和精纺机的保全工作，只注意纱断头率，对用电的浪费从不给以重视。试点工作组协助该厂在精纺和梳棉部分进行了重点试验，使梳棉车的耗电量降低百分之二十，精纺车耗电量降低百分之十。仅此一个措施，就使该厂每月用电减少五万四千度。另外，又把该厂容量过大的电动机加以调整，在停车时变压器开关及时拉开，车子运行时减少了跑空车的现象等等，每月也可节省电力一万五千度以上。如果把这些经验推广到上海所有棉纺织工厂，估计每年可节约五千万度的电力。
    事实有力地教育了上海电业管理局的干部，使大家看到了电力浪费现象和节约的可能，从而提高了对推行节约用电工作的信心。同时，由于通过经常不断地派干部下厂，进行技术协助，通过电工讲习班对电工的训练，培养了节约用电骨干分子，以及举办了各种行业、各种类型的节约用电经验交流会，安全用电实物图片展览会，和印刷节约用电快报，节约用电工作也开始得到了工厂企业单位的普遍重视。很多工厂、企业单位都先后成立了专门领导节约用电工作的专业小组。或者指定专人，指导这一工作的进行。尤其是经常不断地召开各种行业、各种类型的节约用电经验交流会议，对节约用电的开展起了很大作用，像私营棉纺织业的全行业、中南橡胶厂、上海面粉厂的节约用电工作，都是在经验交流会的影响下开展起来的。有些厂虽不在上海电业管理局节约用电范围，也同样参加了这一工作，如私营伟昌纱厂自动参加节约用电以后，使该厂每包纱平均减少用电四十度。并主动配合上海电业管理局进行降低锭子油黏度等各种节约用电试验。
    很多工厂的事实证明，合理节约用电工作，是和各工厂、企业单位本身的降低成本和生产技术改进相结合的。如申新五厂从前年第四季度起，解决了电动机的负荷过载以来，用电大大减少，而且增产可以顺利进行。目前该厂已节约了七十多万度的电力，力率也由零点六五提高到零点七五。东方钢业厂采用了合成树脂轴承代替铜质轴承的措施，及紧凑了压延过程以后，单位产品耗电量已降低了百分之二十一，产量增加了百分之四十，同时节约了很多轴承用的铜料及润滑用的大量食油。一年多来，很多工厂都得到了类似的成绩。
    上海市全面开展合理节约用电工作虽已得到显著成绩，但这一工作在各厂发展还不平衡，根据四百五十个工厂的统计，节约毫无成绩的厂仍在一半以上。他们有的强调中心工作多，没有时间搞。有的认为电对降低成本来说是“小事”，而没有认识到从整个国家利益来看却是一件大事；或者孤立地把节约用电工作看成是电业部门、或者机电工作人员的事，与他们“无关”。也有的厂盲目自满，认为本厂节约“到顶”了。甚至仍有个别厂的领导人员，对节约用电至今仍采取不加过问的态度。
    合理节约用电的另一重要问题，是不少工厂虽已创造了很多经验，但未能进一步总结提高，及时在同业中加以推广，或订出制度贯彻到生产计划中去，以致不少单位现有的成绩不能巩固，已有的经验局限在少数厂里，使节约成绩不能进一步扩大。如棉纺织业系统至今仍有不少单位，虽生产同一种产品，而甲车间的耗电量却比乙车间的耗电量高的多。部分厂由于缺乏制度，或订了制度没有很好的贯彻，甚至使耗电情形又恢复到原来的状态。
    上海市为加强对这一工作的领导，在上海市财委统一领导下已成立了节约原材料（包括节约用电）办公室，华东纺织管理局所属上海各厂和各公私合营厂及部分私营棉纺织工厂，已展开了节约用电竞赛，很多工厂都已先后订出今后节约用电计划，以便把工作进一步开展起来。
