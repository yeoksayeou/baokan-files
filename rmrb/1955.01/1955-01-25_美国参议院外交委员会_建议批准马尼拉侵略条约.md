Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 24th: The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 21st, by a vote of fourteen to one, recommended that the Senate approve the Manila Aggression Treaty.

    Prior to this, former U.S. Congressman Fish, at a hearing convened by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 19th, expressed opposition to the ratification of this treaty. Fish said that this treaty is a "ridiculous" proposal, and it "may plunge us into a disastrous war shortly after the ink on the treaty is dry." He also said: India, Indonesia, and Burma, the three largest Southeast Asian countries, have refused to participate in the Manila Treaty, "This fact clearly shows that something is wrong with this treaty from the very beginning. Since India, Indonesia, and Burma did not participate, this treaty is clearly built on quicksand without a permanent or moral foundation. The treaty has the mark of being made in the United States and supported by dollar diplomacy, and this is the reason why we have failed to obtain the practical or even moral support of these three largest Southeast Asian countries."

    美国参议院外交委员会
    建议批准马尼拉侵略条约
    【新华社二十四日讯】华盛顿消息：美国参议院外交委员会二十一日以十四票对一票建议参议院批准马尼拉侵略条约。
    在此以前，美国前众议员费许在十九日参议院外交委员会召集的意见听取会议上表示反对批准这个条约。费许说，这个条约是一个“荒谬的”建议，它“可能在条约上的墨迹干了以后不久便把我们卷入灾难性的战争”。他还说：印度、印度尼西亚和缅甸三个最大的东南亚国家都拒绝参加马尼拉条约，“这个事实清楚地表明这个条约从一开始就有些不对头。由于印度、印度尼西亚和缅甸没有参加，这个条约显然是建筑在没有永久的或道义的基础的流沙上面。这个条约上有着美国制和得到美元外交支持的标记，这一点就是我们未能得到这三个最大的东南亚国家的实际的、甚至是道义的支持的原因。”
