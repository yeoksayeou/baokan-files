    Over 10,000 metalworking technicians in Shanghai have recently signed up to participate in national key construction projects such as the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant and the Tractor Manufacturing Plant. Many moving stories have emerged during this mobilization and registration process. Xue Shunsheng, an elderly technician at Yuji Machine Factory, signed up with his son during the first round of mobilization. Although he was initially kept behind, he now resolutely requests to personally manufacture automobiles or tractors. When Zhu Jinde of Dazhong Iron Factory signed up this time, his two young sons (Young Pioneers) wrote a letter to the factory's Party branch, asking them to encourage their father to participate in key construction projects, and expressing their intention to study diligently at school and help their mother with chores at home. The children's love for socialism has greatly encouraged the older workers. (Report from our Shanghai correspondent)

    上海一万多五金技术工人报名参加重点建设工程
    上海市最近已有一万多名五金技术工人报名参加第一汽车制造厂、拖拉机制造厂等国家重点工程建设。在这次动员报名过程中，涌现了很多动人的事迹。裕记机器厂老年技工薛顺生，在第一批动员时曾同儿子一起报了名，当时他被留下来，这次他又坚决要求去亲手制造汽车或拖拉机。大中铁工厂朱金德这次报名时，他的两个小儿子（少年先锋队员）写信给厂里党支部，要求鼓励他爸爸参加重点建设，并表示要在校里用心学习，在家里帮助妈妈做事。少年儿童对社会主义的热爱，使年长工人受到很大的鼓舞。（本报上海记者站）
