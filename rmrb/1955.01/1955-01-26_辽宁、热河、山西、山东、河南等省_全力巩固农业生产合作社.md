Xinhua News Agency report:

Liaoning, Rehe, Shanxi, Shandong, Henan and other provinces are making every effort to rectify and consolidate existing agricultural production cooperatives in order to ensure the healthy development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement.

The first Liaoning Provincial Conference on Agricultural Production Mutual Aid and Cooperation determined that in 1955, efforts should be made to vigorously consolidate and improve existing cooperatives, and to strengthen the leadership of mutual aid teams accordingly. Agricultural production cooperatives in Liaoning Province have developed to more than 30,000, and the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives has accounted for about 32% of the total number of peasant households. More than 90% of the old cooperatives have achieved varying degrees of increased production. Most of the new cooperatives have a good foundation, but some have a poor foundation, and the thinking of the members is not stable, requiring rectification and consolidation. The meeting criticized some rural work cadres for placing emphasis on development and neglecting consolidation, and on cooperatives while neglecting mutual aid teams in the development of mutual aid and cooperation. The meeting emphasized that existing cooperatives must be run well and that progress must be made on a consolidated front. The meeting also corrected the erroneous understanding of opposing consolidation with development, and emphasized conducting in-depth, arduous, and meticulous work, especially ideological education. The meeting put forward four standards for running existing cooperatives well: ensuring increased production, reasonable distribution, accepting state plans, and uniting and helping peasants outside the cooperatives. To achieve these standards, it is necessary to implement the policy of gradual improvement through classification. The main content of improvement is to grasp the two basic links of continuous increase in production and the enhancement of the socialist ideological consciousness of cooperative members. The meeting believed that strengthening the leadership of the Party and further implementing the Party's class policy in rural areas is the fundamental guarantee for the healthy development of the cooperative movement in the future. In view of the current rural situation, the meeting put forward specific measures to further strengthen the leadership of the Party and implement the class policy.

Since the beginning of the month, the county and banner committees of the Chinese Communist Party in Rehe Province have successively held meetings of key leaders at the district level to review the work of developing agricultural production cooperatives. According to this review, after the Spring Festival, each county will comprehensively launch rectification work on newly established cooperatives. In order to gain experience in rectifying newly established cooperatives, Qinglong and other ten counties and banners have transferred more than 500 cadres from the counties to work in pilot areas. The meetings in each county and banner further improved the policy and ideological level of the cadres. Because Xinglong County had fewer mutual aid and cooperation organizations in the past, cadres blindly pursued the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives during the establishment of the cooperatives, and did not implement the principle of voluntariness well, resulting in many newly established cooperatives being very unstable. After this review, these cadres gained a further understanding of the policy of "actively leading and steadily advancing", recognized the harm of blind development without considering local conditions, and ensured that rectification work would be done well. In the past, some cadres in Chengde County had a relatively vague understanding of the Party's rural class policy. Many people only saw that landlords and rich peasants were superficially "honest," so they absorbed them in large numbers when establishing cooperatives, which led to them creating trouble in the cooperatives and affecting the consolidation of the cooperatives. In the past, the Secretary of the First District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Luanping County set the rent price too high when dealing with the issue of cooperative members' land joining the cooperatives, which damaged the interests of poor peasants and led to low enthusiasm among poor peasants. Based on the review of these facts, many cadres have gained a further understanding of the important significance of implementing the Party's rural class policy and are determined to grasp and implement it well during the rectification of cooperatives.

At present, various places in Shanxi Province are using the mutual aid and cooperation network to assist in the rectification and consolidation of agricultural production cooperatives. The Changzhi Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently trained 898 central cooperative chairpersons from the mutual aid and cooperation network organization in the entire region, and formulated a new contact system and tasks. Now these central cooperatives will contact 7,000 agricultural production cooperatives and 20,000 mutual aid teams according to the new tasks to help rectify, consolidate, and organize mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and to drive all peasants to comprehensively carry out preparations for spring plowing. The fifteen mutual aid and cooperation networks established in Xia County have held two to three liaison meetings to study and solve specific problems in the current rectification of agricultural production cooperatives, such as livestock evaluation and land assessment.

While developing agricultural production cooperatives, Shandong Province has also carried out consolidation and improvement work on more than 24,800 old cooperatives. The Wendeng Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Caoxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in the Heze area have specially held training classes for the backbone of old cooperatives to exchange experience in management and administration. After the distribution of income, agricultural production cooperatives in various places also universally conducted a summary evaluation of the whole year's production, and solved the problems existing in the cooperatives. The management committee of the Zhongshanggao Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Tai'an County had weak leadership ability, and the labor organization was not rational enough; during the summary evaluation, the cooperative members put forward suggestions for improvement, democratically re-elected the management committee, and re-divided the production teams. After the rectification, the cooperative members' production enthusiasm was very high. In the spring of last year, the Tianzhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wenshang County had expelled seven poor peasant households lacking means of production from the cooperative. During the summary evaluation, the cooperative members put forward opinions to the management committee, and the management committee also conducted a review. Now these seven poor peasant households have returned to the cooperative.

In accordance with the spirit that the mutual aid and cooperation movement must achieve "health first," the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently conducted a special study of the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the province, and decided to revise the original plan to develop 50,000 agricultural production cooperatives in the province from the winter of last year to the spring of this year to 40,000. Local party committees at all levels have re-revised their plans in accordance with this decision of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. At present, various places are strengthening the leadership of existing cooperatives in conjunction with the development work. Some places where the work of establishing cooperatives has basically ended have shifted the focus of leadership entirely to consolidating new and old cooperatives.

### 辽宁、热河、山西、山东、河南等省  全力巩固农业生产合作社

    辽宁、热河、山西、山东、河南等省
    全力巩固农业生产合作社
    据新华社讯：辽宁、热河、山西、山东、河南等省为了保证农业互助合作运动的健康发展，正在全力整顿和巩固现有农业生产合作社。
    辽宁省第一次农业生产互助合作会议确定一九五五年要大力巩固和提高现有社，相应地加强对互助组的领导。辽宁省全省的农业生产合作社已发展到三万多个，入社农户已占总农户百分之三十二左右。老社有百分之九十以上获得了不同程度的增产。新社大部分基础较好，一部分基础不好，社员思想不稳固，需要整顿和巩固。会上批判了有些农村工作干部在发展互助合作工作中，有着重发展轻巩固和重社轻组的偏向。会议强调指出必须办好现有社，在巩固的阵地上前进。会议还纠正了把巩固与发展对立起来的错误认识，强调了进行深入、艰苦和细致的工作，特别是思想教育工作。会议提出了对办好现有社的四项标准：确保增产，合理分配，接受国家计划，团结和帮助社外农民。实现这些标准，必须贯彻分类逐步提高的方针。提高的主要内容是，抓住不断增产和提高社员社会主义思想觉悟两个基本环节。会议认为加强党的领导和进一步贯彻党在农村的阶级政策，是今后合作化运动健康发展的根本保证。会议针对当前农村情况，提出了进一步加强党的领导，和贯彻阶级政策的具体措施。
    中共热河省各县、旗委员会，从月初以来相继召开了区一级主要负责人的会议，检查了发展农业生产合作社的工作。根据这次检查，春节后各县即将全面展开对新建社的整顿工作。为了取得整顿新建社的经验，青龙等十个县、旗已从县里抽调了五百多名干部下乡试点。各县、旗的会议，进一步提高了干部的政策思想水平。兴隆县由于过去互助合作组织较少，建社中干部盲目追求入社农户数字，没有很好贯彻自愿原则，结果许多新建社很不巩固。经过这次检查，这些干部对“积极领导稳步前进”的方针就有了进一步的领会，认识了不根据当地条件盲目发展的危害性，并保证做好整社工作。承德县部分干部过去对党的农村阶级政策认识比较模糊，不少人只看到地主和富农在表面上“老实”，就在建社时大量吸收了他们，以致他们在社内兴风作浪，影响社的巩固。中共滦平县第一区区委书记过去在处理社员土地入社问题时，定的租价过高，损伤了贫农的利益，以致贫农积极性不高。根据这些事实的检查，许多干部对贯彻党的农村阶级政策的重要意义，都有了进一步认识，决心在整社时很好掌握并加以贯彻。
    山西省各地目前正运用互助合作网，协助整顿和巩固农业生产合作社的工作。中共长治地方委员会最近训练了全区互助合作网组织中的八百九十八个中心社社长，并订出新的联系制度和任务。现在这些中心社将根据新的任务联系七千个农业生产合作社和两万个互助组，帮助整顿巩固和组织互助合作组织，并带动全体农民全面开展春耕的准备工作。夏县建立的十五处互助合作网，已召开过二次到三次接头会，研究解决当前整顿农业生产合作社中的牲口评价、土地评产等具体问题。
    山东省在发展农业生产合作社同时，对二万四千八百多个老社进行了巩固和提高工作。中共文登地委及菏泽地区的中共曹县县委等，曾专门举行了老社骨干训练班，交流经营管理的经验。各地的农业生产合作社在收益分配结束后，还普遍地进行了全年生产的总结评比，解决了社内存在的问题。泰安县中上高村农业生产合作社管理委员会领导能力弱，劳动组织不够合理；在总结评比中，社员们提出了改进意见，民主改选了管理委员会，重新划分了生产队，经过整顿后，社员生产情绪都很高。汶上县田庄农业生产合作社在去年春天，曾经把七户缺少生产资料的贫农排挤出社，在总结评比中，社员们向管理委员会提出了意见，管理委员会也进行了检讨，现在这七户贫农都已经回到了社里。
    根据互助合作运动必须做到“健康第一”的精神，中共河南省委员会最近对全省互助合作运动发展情况进行了专门研究，决定把全省原定去冬今春农业生产合作社发展到五万个的计划，修订为四万个。各级地方党委都已依据中共河南省委这一决定重新修订了计划。目前，各地正结合发展工作对现有社加强领导。有些建社工作基本结束的地方，已经把领导重心全部转到巩固新社和老社方面来。
