Northeast State Farm Bureau's various farms have comprehensively launched spring plowing preparations. In order to improve the quality, purity, and germination rate of seeds, seed selection and sun-drying have been carried out early. The first round of fine selection of more than 4,500 tons of wheat seeds has now been completed, and some farms are conducting the second fine selection. In addition to two or more fine selections of soybean seeds, some farms are also carrying out grain selection. In order to ensure seed quality, each farm has established a management system, with dedicated personnel responsible for preventing mixing and regular inspections. In order to further expand the fertilizer application area, the Northeast State Farm Bureau allocated 1,000 tons of superphosphate to each farm, and each farm has now used it to produce more than 1,000 tons of granular fertilizer, and is still continuing to produce it. In response to past situations, each farm has corrected the tendency to neglect the maintenance and repair of agricultural implements. At present, winter mechanical repairs have entered a tense stage, and more than a hundred tractors have entered the repair shop. The progress and quality of repairs have improved compared with previous years. The Red Star Farm will be able to complete all winter repairs by the end of the year, and the Jiusan Farm has now repaired more than 20 tractors. In conjunction with the preparations for plowing, the farms have widely launched technical instruction movements, and five to six thousand workers have generally learned technical knowledge.

    东北各机械农场提早选种制肥检修机具
    东北国营农场管理局所属各农场，已全面展开春耕准备工作。为提高种籽的质量、纯度和发芽率，提早进行了选种和晒种。现在四千五百多吨小麦种籽第一遍精选工作已结束，部分农场正进行第二次精选。大豆种籽除进行了两次以上的精选以外，有的农场正在进行粒选。为了保证种籽质量，各场都建立了保管制度，设有专人负责，严防混杂，并定时检查。为进一步扩大施肥面积，东北国营农场管理局拨到各场过磷酸钙一千吨，现各场已用它制出颗粒肥料千余吨，目前仍在继续赶制中。针对过去情况，各场都纠正了忽视农具保养检修的偏向，目前冬季机械检修已进入紧张阶段，百余台拖拉机都已进入修理厂，检修进度及质量较往年都有提高。红星农场年底即可全部结束冬季检修工作，九三农场现已修出拖拉机二十多台。结合着备耕工作，各农场广泛展开技术传授运动，五六千职工普遍学习了技术常识。
