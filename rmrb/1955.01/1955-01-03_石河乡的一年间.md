A Year in Shihe Township
By Our Correspondent Gao Changren

When the peasants of Shihe Township, Xishui County, Hubei Province, summed up the benefits of the unified purchase and sale of grain over the past year, they all felt that since the land reform, the countryside had been constantly changing, but no year had seen changes as rapid as last year.

Last year, the most prominent change in Shihe Township was the leap forward in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Before the township organized agricultural producers' cooperatives, credit cooperatives, and supply and marketing cooperatives, some farmers with surplus grain and capital were planning how to do business and lend money at interest, most of the mutual aid teams were not consolidated, and usury was very active. Poor peasant Yi Kecheng borrowed a shi of grain from a usurer when food was scarce, and before twenty days had passed, his grain was harvested, but he had to painfully take out two shi of grain to repay the debt. Without supply and marketing cooperatives, farmers had to go to Xishui city and trade with private merchants to buy things, suffering from intermediary exploitation.

However, in just one year, the farmers of Shihe Township were generally educated in the Party's general line, and their socialist consciousness greatly improved. Under the leadership of the Party branch, seven year-round mutual aid teams were transformed into four agricultural producers' cooperatives last spring. During the summer production, the mutual aid teams were consolidated and improved. In the autumn, sixteen new agricultural producers' cooperatives were established. Now 90 percent of the township's farmers are organized.

The superiority of agricultural producers' cooperatives in overcoming natural disasters greatly educated the peasants. Seventy-seven percent of the fields of the "Tomorrow" Agricultural Producers' Cooperative were flooded by mountain torrents in the summer. They fully utilized the advantages of collective management, replanted a large number of late autumn crops after the flood receded, and also planted vegetables and engaged in sideline businesses. As a result, each member increased their income compared to when they were working individually. Xu Xianlin, a middle peasant who originally planned to work individually and compete with the cooperative, also actively requested to join the cooperative. The number of farmers in the township requesting to join groups and cooperatives increased day by day.

Last year, credit cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives were also established, and 100 percent of the township's farmers (excluding rich peasants) became shareholders. During the period of food scarcity, the credit cooperative issued more than 39 million yuan in loans. Farmers in difficulty borrowed money from the credit cooperative and bought rice from the supply and marketing cooperative, no longer suffering from usury. Qiu Shenyi, a wealthy middle peasant who used to lend money at high interest rates, withheld two shi and five dou of grain when selling surplus grain the year before last. He originally estimated that grain prices would definitely rise last spring, and poor peasants who lacked grain would definitely come to him to borrow grain to eat. However, the whole spring and summer passed, and the grain price remained at 510 yuan per jin, and no poor peasant came to him. His two shi and five dou of old grain became infested with insects at home, and he did not dare to take it out to dry, so he had to secretly grind it into rice for himself, and he even ground the rice into broken pieces; others ate new rice and whole rice, but he ate old rice and broken rice. His attempt to get rich by exploiting others was blocked. When selling surplus grain last year, Qiu Shenyi took the lead in examining his mistakes and sold all his surplus grain to the state. There were more than 20 middle peasant households like him in Shihe Township; they all regretted that they had miscalculated, admitted that the old road was impassable, and that they must take the new road.

With the development of the three types of cooperation, the farmers of Shihe Township invested the surplus capital from selling grain last year into production and improved their farming techniques. Last year, the chemical fertilizers (ammonium sulfate) bought by farmers in the township increased by one time compared with the previous year; cake fertilizer increased by one time; natural fertilizer increased by one-third; the township had only three new-style walking plows the year before last, and 28 more were added last year; 50 percent of the paddy fields in the township used the Victory Indica good variety the year before last, and 90 percent of the fields were planted with Victory Indica last year. In terms of water conservancy, in addition to building 110 ponds and weirs, two small sluice gates were also newly built; many farmers learned the advanced experience of transplanting seedlings, turning fields that harvested two crops a year into three crops a year (first planting wheat, then transplanting seedlings to harvest rice, and finally planting buckwheat). The advanced farming techniques of deep plowing, close planting, and rational fertilization were widely promoted among the 90 percent of farmers who were organized. Therefore, although some areas suffered from floods last year, the township still increased production by 10 percent.

The increase in agricultural production has brought a richer life to the peasants. The living standards of farmers participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations have improved even faster. Li Yunfu, a member of the agricultural producers' cooperative, had a grain shortage from transplanting seedlings to harvesting grain in 1952. The year before last, his grain ration was enough, and he added eleven new clothes, large and small. Last year, his grain ration was even more abundant, and he sold 800 jin of surplus grain, and the whole family added 19 new clothes. His mother could not afford new clothes the year before last, but added three new clothes last year. He himself bought sneakers and an umbrella, and added some other new furniture. The year before last, he only ate 1.4 jin of meat during the Dragon Boat Festival, but last year, he bought two jin of pork and also drank some wine. Four of the seventeen households in their cooperative bought thermos bottles, and many farmers bought rubber shoes, sneakers, and made fine cloth clothes last year. Another member named Song Shengshun could not afford a mosquito net for many years, and relied only on burning smoke to drive away mosquitoes in the summer. Last year, he bought two new mosquito nets, and his wife wore a poplin jacket for the first time in her life. When Li Yunfu and Song Shengshun talked about their improved living conditions this year, they both said: "If it weren't for the unified purchase and sale and the development of the three major cooperatives, our lives would not have improved so quickly."

What is even more valuable is the change in people—the profound changes that have taken place in the peasants' thinking. There was a poor peasant named Wan Xinde who had always been running errands and buying things for the landlord when he worked for the landlord, and was not good at farming. After the land reform, although he was allocated land, he still often went to the streets to do a small business, saying: "Farming is hard and tiring, it's not as good as doing a small business." Last year, he was educated by the Party's general line during the transition period, so he went home to farm; last year, not only did he farm well, but he also raised two fat pigs and thirty chickens. In the past, people said that he liked to loaf around and could not be relied upon. Now, people praise him as a "good example" in agricultural and sideline production. The year before last, there were more than 20 cattle brokers and eight brokers in Shihe Township. These people relied on a mouth and a scale to carry out intermediary exploitation. Since the unified purchase and sale of grain last year, they have all embarked on the right path and engaged in agricultural production. The one who performed the best was Cai Qingyun, who used to earn some money from running a cattle business, and then ate, drank, gambled, spent it all, and was still poor year after year. Last year, his father and three sons joined the agricultural producers' cooperative and worked very well; in the spring, they also built a new house. Seeing the transformation of these people, the peasants said: "If it weren't for the good policies of the Communist Party, how could these people have changed so quickly!"

The year before last autumn, the common greeting among peasants was: "What's the price of grain today?" "What business is good to do?" "What can you sell to make money?" Last year, mutual aid and cooperation, and increased agricultural production became the common topics in the countryside, and everyone talked about: "How much grain did your cooperative or your group harvest?" "How does your cooperative or your group arrange work and calculate points?" Or they discussed who was asking to join which agricultural cooperative or which mutual aid team.

The standard-bearer leading the peasants of Shihe Township forward—the Shihe Township Branch of the Chinese Communist Party—has also grown stronger. The year before last, there were only eleven Party members in the township, one of whom, Zhu Xinfu, was expelled from the Party for having exploitative thoughts and behaviors. Last year, the Party branch had 22 Party members, all of whom participated in agricultural producers' cooperatives and became leaders in the peasants' new road. The number of Youth League members has also grown from 42 to 83.

All these changes have given the peasants of Shihe Township a very profound and vivid education. They said: "Implementing the unified purchase and sale of grain and developing the three major cooperatives really has many benefits and great changes, all thanks to the good leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!"

In October last year, the peasants of Shihe Township summed up the benefits of the unified purchase and sale the year before last, understood the policy of selling surplus grain, and happily sold 500,000 jin of surplus grain to the state.

    石河乡的一年间
    本报记者　高长任
    湖北省浠水县石河乡农民总结一年来的粮食统购统销的好处时，大家都觉得：自从土地改革以后，农村就在不断的变化，可是，那一年也没有去年变化的这么快。
    去年，石河乡变化最突出的是互助合作运动的飞跃发展。这个乡没有组织农业生产合作社、信用合作社和供销合作社以前，有部分有余粮余资的农民都打算着如何做点生意放点债，大多数互助组都不巩固，高利贷非常活跃。贫农易克成在青黄不接时，向高利贷主借了一石谷，没过二十天，他的谷子收下来了，却不得不忍痛拿出两石谷来还债。没有供销合作社，农民要买点东西，都要跑到浠水城和私商交易，受中间剥削。
    不过一年的工夫，石河乡农民普遍受到党的总路线的教育，社会主义觉悟大大提高；在党支部领导下，去年春天，有七个常年互助组转成了四个农业生产合作社。在夏季生产中，互助组都得到巩固和提高。秋天，又新建了十六个农业生产合作社。现在全乡农民已有百分之九十组织起来。
    农业生产合作社在战胜自然灾害上显示的优越性，大大教育了农民。“明天”农业生产合作社有百分之七十七的田在夏季被山洪淹没。他们充分发挥集体经营的优越性，水退后补种了大量晚秋作物，还种植蔬菜、经营副业，结果，每个社员都比单干时增加了收入。原来打算单干下去和社比赛的中农徐贤林，也积极要求入社了。全乡要求入组入社的农民逐日增加。
    去年信用合作社和供销合作社也建立起来了，全乡百分之百的农民（不包括富农）都入了股。在青黄不接的时候，信用合作社发放了三千九百多万元贷款，有困难的农民都到信用合作社借钱，到供销合作社买米，再也不受高利贷的剥削了。有一个过去放惯高利贷的富裕中农邱申贻，前年卖余粮时瞒了二石五斗谷子没卖，他原来估计去年春天粮价一定要涨，缺粮的贫农一定要向他借粮吃。可是，整个春天、夏天过去了，谷子价钱还一直是五百一十元一斤，也没有一个贫农上门来求他。他这二石五斗陈谷在家里生了虫，又不敢拿出来晒，只好偷偷地碾成米自己吃，还把米都碾碎了；别人吃新米和整米，他却吃陈米和碎米。他企图靠剥削别人来发财的路被堵死了。在去年卖余粮的时候，邱申贻带头检讨他的错误，把余粮都卖给了国家。像他这样的中农，石河乡有二十多户；他们都后悔自己打错了算盘，承认旧道路走不通，一定要走新道路。
    随着三种合作的发展，石河乡农民把去年卖粮的余资都投入了生产，改进了耕作技术。去年全乡农民买的化学肥料（硫酸錏）比前年增加了一倍；饼肥增加了一倍；自然肥料增加了三分之一；前年全乡只有三部新式步犁，去年又增加了二十八部；前年有百分之五十的稻田采用胜利籼良种，去年则有百分之九十的田插上了胜利籼。水利方面，除了兴修一百一十口塘、堰外，还新建了两个小型水闸；许多农民学习了掇秧法的先进经验，把一年收两季的田变成一年收三季（先种小麦，其次掇秧收稻谷，最后种荞麦）的。深耕、密植、合理施肥的先进耕作技术，在百分之九十组织起来的农民中普遍推广。因此，去年有一部分地区虽然受到水灾，全乡还是增产了一成。
    农业的增产，给农民带来了更富裕的生活。参加互助合作组织的农民们生活水平提高的更快。农业生产合作社社员李云福在一九五二年从插秧到割谷一直缺口粮。前年，口粮够了，还添了大小十一件新衣。去年，他的口粮更充裕，还卖出八百斤余粮，全家大小新添了十九件新衣。他的母亲在前年置不起新衣，去年新添了三件。他自己买了球鞋、雨伞，还新添了些别的家具。前年过端阳节，只吃一斤四两肉，去年，买了二斤猪肉，还喝了点酒。他们社里十七户人家，有四家买上了热水瓶，去年买胶鞋、球鞋和做细布衣服的农民很多。另一个社员叫宋生顺，多少年来置不起蚊帐，夏天只靠薰烟来赶蚊子。去年，他新买了两顶蚊帐，他的妻子生平第一次穿上府绸褂子。当李云福和宋生顺谈起他们今年生活改善的时候，他们都说：“要不是统购统销，发展三大合作，我们生活不会提高的这么快。”
    更可贵的是人的变化——农民思想上发生的深刻的变化。有个叫万新德的贫农，他过去替地主干活时，一直是跑腿买东西，种田不内行。土地改革后，他虽然分到了田，但还是经常到街上去做个小生意，他说：“种田又苦又累划不来，不如做个小生意快活。”去年，他受到党在过渡时期的总路线的教育，就回家种田；去年，不但田种的很好，而且还喂了两口肥猪，养了三十只鸡子。从前，人们都说他这个人爱打流，不能落实。现在，人们又称赞他在农副业生产上是个“好样儿的”。前年，石河乡还有二十多个开牛行赶牛鞭的，有八个开牙行的。这些人都靠一张嘴一杆秤进行中间剥削。自从去年粮食统购以后，他们都走上正道，他们从事农业生产了。其中表现最好的是蔡庆云，过去开牛行赚了几个钱，就吃、喝、赌钱，大进大出花光了，还是一年穷一年。去年，他父子三个参加了农业生产合作社，劳动得很好；春天，还盖了新房子。看到这些人的转变，农民都说：“不是共产党的政策好，这些人那能变得这样快！”
    前年秋天，农民互相见面的家常话是：“今天谷价好多？”“什么生意好做？”“贩什么东西能赚钱？”去年，互助合作、农业增产成了农村的家常话，大家谈论的是：“你们那个社、那个组打的粮食好多？”“你们社、你们组怎么排工、计分？”再不就是议论谁又要求参加哪个农业社、哪个互助组了。
    领导石河乡农民前进的旗手——中共石河乡支部也壮大了。前年全乡只有十一个党员，其中还有个叫朱新福的党员因为有剥削思想和行为被开除了党籍。去年，党支部已有二十二名党员，这些党员都参加了农业生产合作社，成为农民走新道路的带头人。青年团员也由四十二人发展到现在的八十三人。
    这一切变化，给了石河乡农民非常深刻、生动的教育。他们说：“实行粮食统购统销，发展三大合作，真是好处多，变化大，全是共产党、毛主席领导的好！”
    去年十月里，石河乡农民总结了前年统购统销的好处，明白了卖余粮的政策以后，愉快地把五十万斤余粮卖给了国家。
