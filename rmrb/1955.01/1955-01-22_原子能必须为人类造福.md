    Atomic Energy Must Benefit Humanity
    Qian Sanqiang, Director of the Institute of Modern Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences

    Recently, we have seen consecutive news reports from the Soviet Union regarding the peaceful use of atomic energy and the promotion of international cooperation in atomic energy. We are infinitely excited by and wholeheartedly support the Soviet Union's actions. Shortly after the Soviet Union announced on July 1, 1954, that its first industrial atomic power station had begun generating electricity, the Soviet Union was preparing, after only half a year, to submit a report on the first industrial atomic power station and its operations to the international conference discussing the peaceful use of atomic energy. Subsequently, the Soviet Council of Ministers issued a statement announcing that the Soviet government had suggested to China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and the German Democratic Republic that it provide scientific, technical, and industrial assistance, and was also considering expanding the scope of the countries it could assist. Just as the American aggressive bloc is arrogantly and openly preparing for atomic warfare, these decisions and statements by the Soviet Union once again point out the proper path for the development of atomic energy to the people of all countries and set an example for international cooperation in the peaceful utilization of atomic energy.

    Since the French scientist Becquerel discovered radioactivity at the end of the nineteenth century and the Curies discovered radium, the tireless work of scientists from all over the world finally laid the scientific foundation for the application of atomic energy in 1939. Unfortunately, this great discovery was seized by the American aggressive bloc, which used it to manufacture atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, threatening world peace and creating international tensions. Now, the era of the American aggressive bloc's monopoly of atomic energy is long gone. Our great ally, the Soviet Union, while shouldering the full burden of the war against German fascism, never relaxed its research on atomic energy, and after the war, it made great progress in this area. On November 6, 1947, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov announced that the secret of the atomic bomb "has long ceased to exist." In 1949, the Soviet Union announced the use of atomic explosions to create the necessary conditions for water conservancy projects. In 1953, Comrade Malenkov announced at the Supreme Soviet meeting that hydrogen weapons were no longer the exclusive possession of the United States. At this stage, the Soviet Union had reached parity with the United States in the progress of atomic energy development. The successful establishment of the Soviet atomic energy industrial power station in 1954 demonstrated that the Soviet Union's work at the forefront of science had surpassed that of the United States. Now, the Soviet Union's decision to publicly report on the status of its atomic energy industrial power station and to support our five countries in developing atomic energy further demonstrates the leaps and bounds in both the quality and quantity of its work in this area. This is not only a victory for the Soviet people, but also a victory for the peace and democracy camp and all peace-loving people around the world.

    The Soviet Union has always attached great importance to the peaceful uses of atomic energy and has always advocated banning the use of weapons of mass destruction. In contrast, the American aggressive bloc is frantically preparing for atomic warfare, with American military expenditures accounting for two-thirds of the entire year's budget this year. At the same time, the American aggressive bloc is stepping up pressure on the member states of the "Western European Union" to ratify the Paris Accords for the rearmament of West Germany, and is preparing to hand over weapons of mass destruction, including atomic weapons, to Nazi revanchist elements. This greatly increases the danger of atomic war. The people of all countries in the world have expressed boundless anger and strong opposition to the American aggressive bloc's intensified preparations for atomic war. As World Peace Council Chairman Joliot-Curie's statement pointed out, "The awakening of the people demonstrates tremendous power." We believe that the people of the world will further unite to thoroughly expose the American conspiracy to prepare for atomic war and resolutely demand the prohibition of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons.

    Our people and scientific workers, together with peace-loving people all over the world, resolutely oppose the American preparations for atomic war and advocate that atomic energy must only be used for peaceful purposes. With the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, China's atomic energy cause will develop by leaps and bounds, and the strength of the peace and democracy camp will be further strengthened. We firmly believe that the forces of peace will surely defeat the forces of war. Let us contribute all our strength and strive for the prohibition of atomic weapons and the peaceful use of atomic energy.

    原子能必须为人类造福
    中国科学院近代物理研究所所长  钱三强
    最近我们从报上接连地看到苏联关于和平使用原子能和促进原子能国际合作的消息，我们对于苏联的行动感到无限兴奋并表示衷心地拥护。在一九五四年七月一日苏联发表第一个原子能工业电力站已经开始发电后，刚过半年苏联就准备向讨论和平利用原子能国际会议提出关于第一个原子能工业电力站及其工作情况的报告，接着苏联部长会议又发表声明，宣布苏联政府已经向我国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、德意志民主共和国建议提供科学、技术和工业上的帮助，同时还在考虑扩大它所能援助的国家的范围。正当美国侵略集团狂妄地公开准备原子战争的时候，苏联的这些决定和声明再一次向世界各国人民指出了原子能发展的正当途径，并为在和平利用原子能方面实行国际合作树立了范例。
    自从十九世纪末法国的贝克莱尔发现放射性现象和居里夫妇发现镭以后，经过全世界各国科学家不断的辛勤劳动，最后终于在一九三九年奠定了原子能应用的科学基础。但是不幸这个伟大的发现被美国侵略集团所霸占，利用它制造了原子武器、氢武器，威胁世界和平和制造国际紧张局势。现在美国侵略集团垄断原子能的时期早已不存在了。我们伟大的友邦苏联早在担承对德国法西斯战争的全付重担时，也丝毫没有放松过对原子能的研究，战后很快就在这方面取得了巨大的发展。在一九四七年十一月六日，苏联外交部长莫洛托夫宣布：原子弹的秘密“早就不存在了”。一九四九年苏联宣布了使用原子爆炸为水利工程创造必要条件。一九五三年马林科夫同志又在苏联最高苏维埃会议上宣布氢武器也已经不是为美国所独有了。到了这个阶段，苏联在原子能发展的进度上已和美国并驾齐驱。一九五四年苏联原子能工业电力站的建立成功，说明了苏联在科学最前哨的工作已经超过了美国。现在苏联要将原子能工业电力站情况公开报告，并且支援我们五国发展原子能的工作，更加说明了它在这方面的工作的质与量的突飞猛进。这不单是苏联人民的胜利，并且是和平民主阵营和全世界爱好和平的人民的胜利。
    苏联一向极为重视原子能的和平用途，一向主张禁止使用大规模毁灭性的武器。与此相反，美国侵略集团却在疯狂地进行原子战争的准备，今年美国的军事费用占去全年预算的三分之二。同时美国侵略集团又加紧压迫“西欧联盟”参加国批准重新武装西德的巴黎协定，并且准备把包括原子武器在内的大规模毁灭性武器交到纳粹复仇主义分子的手中。这就大大增加了原子战争的危险。世界各国人民对美国侵略集团加紧准备原子战争的行径已表示无比的愤怒和强烈的反对。正如世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里的声明指出的，“人民的觉悟表现出巨大的力量”，我们相信全世界人民一定会进一步团结起来，彻底揭穿美国准备原子战争的阴谋，坚决要求禁止原子武器和氢武器。
    我国的人民和科学工作者同全世界爱好和平的人民一道，坚决反对美国准备原子战争，主张原子能必需只用于和平的目的。在苏联的无私的帮助之下，我国原子能事业将要飞跃发展，和平民主阵营的力量将进一步加强。我们深信和平的力量一定可以战胜战争势力。让我们贡献出一切的力量，为争取禁止原子武器和和平利用原子能而努力。
