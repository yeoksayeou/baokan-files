    Xinhua News Agency, January 19th: The Italian police authorities are attempting to persecute Palmiro Togliatti, General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party. According to a TASS report from Rome on the 18th, newspapers reported that the Chief of Police of Forlì Province has filed a lawsuit in court accusing Palmiro Togliatti of "insulting the President of the Republic." The so-called "crime" with which the Chief of Police is accusing Togliatti is that he issued a statement to the Communist Party members of Rimini on January 6th, saying that the government's dissolution of the Rimini Municipal Committee, composed of Communist and Socialist Party members, was illegal. Note: The Rimini Municipal Committee was dissolved by the Ministry of the Interior on the grounds of "violating administrative regulations" for providing financial assistance to impoverished residents.

    Xinhua News Agency, January 20th: TASS Rome, January 19th: According to a report in the Italian "Unità," the incident of the police authorities of Forlì Province suing Palmiro Togliatti, General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, in court has aroused deep anger among the Italian working people. The leadership committee of the Rimini Municipal Communist Party Organization issued a communiqué protesting against the authorities' new provocation and expressing the solidarity of the working people of Rimini with Togliatti.

    The Communist Party organizations of Milan, Modena, and Perugia, the National Association of Small Tenant Farmers, and many other progressive organizations have also sent telegrams expressing their solidarity with Togliatti.

    【新华社十九日讯】意大利警察当局企图迫害意大利共产党总书记帕尔米罗·陶里亚蒂。据塔斯社罗马十八日消息说：据报纸报道，弗利省警察厅长向法院控告帕尔米罗·陶里亚蒂“侮辱共和国总统”。警察厅长控告陶里亚蒂的所谓“罪状”是：他曾经在一月六日向利米尼市共产党员发表文告，说政府解散由共产党员和社会党员组成的利米尼市政委员会是非法的。按：利米尼市政委员会因为给贫困居民以经济援助，被内政部以“违反行政条例”的罪名解散。
