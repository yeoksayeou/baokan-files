    The United Nations Should Demand the Withdrawal of U.S. Troops from the Taiwan Area

    Just as the United States is blatantly carrying out war provocations on China's coast, the New Zealand government submitted a proposal to the United Nations Security Council on the 28th, requesting the Security Council to hold a meeting to consider the issue of "armed hostilities occurring in the region of certain islands near the mainland coast of China" between the People's Republic of China and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. It is said that this is because the situation caused by such hostile actions "may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security if it continues."

    This proposal by New Zealand is a concrete step in the recent plot by the United States and its followers to achieve a so-called ceasefire through the United Nations. Therefore, the U.S. government and the British government immediately expressed their support. The U.S. representative to the United Nations, Lodge, took the opportunity to threaten that if this situation continues, it would "inevitably bring the danger of expanding the hostilities in question."

    In his statement on January 24, Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai pointed out that the so-called ceasefire plotted by the United States and its followers "is actually interfering in China's internal affairs and dividing China's territory." The New Zealand proposal serves these aggressive purposes of the United States, and the Chinese people absolutely cannot agree to it.

    It must be pointed out that the New Zealand proposal is untenable both legally and factually.

    Taiwan, Penghu, and the islands of Dachen, Jinmen, and Mazu, occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, are all Chinese islands and an inseparable part of Chinese territory. This fact cannot be denied by anyone. British Foreign Secretary Eden once attempted to prove that Taiwan "was never part of China" in this century. However, this statement was immediately refuted by Labor Party leader Attlee. The "Indian Express" also pointed out on the 28th that Eden's argument "is untenable, especially since it is universally agreed that the islands seized from China by Japan at the end of World War II should naturally be returned to China." Moreover, Taiwan was returned to China on October 25, 1945.

    Therefore, the war action of the Chinese people to liberate the coastal islands, including Taiwan and Penghu, is entirely China's internal affair, and the United Nations has no right to interfere at all. The New Zealand proposal violates the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. Article 2, Paragraph 7 of the Charter clearly stipulates: "Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state or shall require the Members to submit such matters to settlement under the present Charter." American international law scholar Goodrich and Norwegian international law scholar Hambro once pointed out in interpreting this clause, "Civil war is clearly a matter of domestic affairs. Any interference by a foreign country or a group of foreign countries to influence the course of the struggle constitutes an infringement on the independence of that country. According to this article, the United Nations organization has no right to interfere in any such internal struggle."

    The Chinese people, in order to exercise their sovereignty and liberate all of China, including the liberation of Taiwan, will never allow anyone to interfere. The New Zealand proposal, instigated by the United States and Britain, attempts to interfere in China's internal affairs through the United Nations, forcing the Chinese people to stop the liberation of Taiwan, Penghu, and other coastal islands, completely dividing China's territory and attempting to create a fait accompli of so-called "two Chinas," which the Chinese people will never allow.

    The New Zealand proposal insists that the current tension in the Taiwan area is caused by the Chinese people's war actions to liberate the coastal islands, which is completely inconsistent with the facts. Since 1949, the Chinese people have liberated many coastal islands and have never caused tension. It was only after the United States occupied Taiwan in 1950 that the situation became tense. In recent years, the United States has continuously supported the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique militarily and economically in carrying out war activities against China. Recently, after signing the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty," the United States has openly stepped forward, stationing troops in the Taiwan Strait and carrying out war threats and atomic intimidation against China, which has further aggravated the tension. The Chinese people have not sent a single soldier to U.S. territory, but the United States has sent its land, sea, and air forces to occupy China's territory of Taiwan and carry out war provocations on the Chinese coast. Anyone with eyes can see that what is causing the tense situation on the Chinese coast is nothing other than the U.S.'s acts of aggression and war provocations.

    However, the New Zealand proposal does not mention the real root cause of the tension in the Far East, nor does it request the United Nations to stop the U.S.'s aggressive acts that threaten peace and security. Instead, it echoes the U.S.'s threats to expand the war, demanding that the Chinese people stop their just actions to liberate the coastal islands and Taiwan. This cannot but be said to be an act of abetting wrongdoing.

    Those who support the New Zealand proposal are now spreading a theory that the rights and wrongs of the Taiwan issue should not be discussed for the time being, and the war actions should be stopped first. The British government is the advocate of this theory. A British Foreign Office spokesman commented on the New Zealand proposal on the 28th, "Our view is that the goal is simple. We do not want to blame the past on either side, nor do we want to damage the legitimate claims of either side in the future. We hope that this war will end as soon as possible."

    What a "simple" goal! The British government knows that the United States is interfering in China's internal affairs from more than 5,000 miles away, invading China's territory, and threatening China's security, but it wants the Chinese people to stop liberating the coastal islands and Taiwan and Penghu without asking right or wrong. This is clearly an attempt to exonerate the United States from its responsibility for aggression and to legitimize the U.S.'s acts of aggression against China. This is also the actual role of the New Zealand proposal.

    The New Zealand proposal is unacceptable to the Chinese people. The Chinese people must liberate the coastal islands and Taiwan and Penghu. Today, the tense situation in the Taiwan area is entirely due to the U.S.'s armed interference. If New Zealand is truly concerned about peace and security in the Far East, it should demand that the United Nations immediately stop the U.S.'s aggression, immediately demand that the U.S. stop its large-scale war provocations and war preparations in the Chinese coastal area, and withdraw all U.S. armed forces from the Taiwan area, rather than demanding that the United Nations interfere in China's internal affairs and promote the U.S.'s aggressive arrogance.

### 联合国应该要求美军从台湾地区撤走

    联合国应该要求美军从台湾地区撤走
    正当美国在中国沿海明目张胆地进行战争挑衅的时候，新西兰政府在二十八日向联合国安全理事会提出了一项建议，要求安全理事会举行会议，考虑中华人民共和国和蒋介石卖国集团“在中国大陆沿海附近的某些岛屿的地区发生武装敌对行动”的问题。据说，这是因为这种敌对行为所引起的局势“继续下去可能威胁国际和平和安全的保障”。
    新西兰的这个建议是美国和它的追随者们最近策动的通过联合国进行所谓停火的诡计的具体步骤之一。因此美国政府和英国政府立即表示支持。美国驻联合国代表洛奇并且乘机恫吓说，如果这种局势继续存在，就要“不可避免地带来了扩大所谈到的敌对行动的危险”。
    我国总理兼外交部长周恩来在一月二十四日的声明中已经指出，美国和它的追随者们所策动的所谓停火，“实际上就是干涉中国内政，割裂中国领土”。新西兰的建议就是为美国的这些侵略目的服务的，中国人民绝对不能同意。
    必须指出，新西兰的建议无论在法理上和事实上，都是站不住脚的。
    蒋介石卖国集团盘踞着的台湾、澎湖以及大陈、金门、马祖等岛屿，都是中国的岛屿，都是中国领土不可分割的一部分。这个事实是任何人都不能否认的。英国外交大臣艾登曾经企图证明台湾在本世纪内“从来也不是中国的一部分”。但是他的这种说法立刻遭到了工党领袖艾德礼的驳斥。“印度快报”也在二十八日指出，艾登的这种论调“是不能成立的，特别是因为大家一致认为，在第二次世界大战结束时，日本从中国夺去的各岛应自然地归还中国”。而且在一九四五年十月二十五日台湾已经归还了中国。
    因此，中国人民解放包括台湾、澎湖在内的沿海岛屿的战争行动，完全属于中国的内政，联合国根本无权干涉。新西兰的建议是违反联合国宪章的宗旨和原则的。宪章第二条第七款明确规定：“本宪章不得认为授权联合国干涉在本质上属于任何国家国内管辖之事件，且并不要求会员国将该项事件依本宪章提请解决”。美国国际法学者古德里区和挪威国际法学者汉布罗在解释这一条款时曾经指出，
  “内战显然是内政问题。一个外国或一个外国集团要影响斗争的过程而进行的任何干涉，都构成对该国独立的侵犯。按照本条规定，联合国组织无权干涉任何这样的内部斗争。”
    中国人民为了行使自己的主权，解放全中国，包括解放台湾在内，决不容许任何人来干涉。美国和英国所策动的新西兰的建议，企图通过联合国来干涉中国内政，强迫中国人民停止解放台湾、澎湖和其他沿海岛屿，完全是割裂中国领土，想造成所谓“两个中国”的既成事实，这是中国人民所决不容许的。
    新西兰的建议硬说目前台湾地区局势的紧张是中国人民解放沿海岛屿的战争行动所引起的，这完全与事实不符。从一九四九年起，中国人民就解放了沿海的许多岛屿，从来没有引起过局势的紧张。只是在一九五○年美国霸占台湾之后，局势才变得紧张起来。几年以来，美国不断从军事上经济上支持蒋介石卖国集团对中国进行战争活动。最近，美国在签订美蒋“共同防御条约”之后，更公然直接出面，陈兵台湾海峡，对中国进行战争威胁和原子恐吓，这就更加剧了局势的紧张。中国人民并没有派遣一兵一卒到美国领土上去，而是美国派遣了它的陆、海、空军部队侵占了中国的领土台湾，并且在中国沿海进行战争挑衅。凡是长眼睛的人都应该可以看到，引起中国沿海的紧张局势的不是别的，正是美国的侵略行为和战争挑衅。
    但是新西兰的建议却根本不谈这个引起远东紧张局势的真正根源，也不要求联合国制止美国这种威胁和平和安全的侵略行为，反而与美国的扩大战争的威胁相唱和，要求中国人民停止解放沿海岛屿和台湾的正当行动，这不能不说是一种助纣为虐的行为。
    支持新西兰建议的人现在散布一种论调说，现在暂时不谈台湾问题上的是非曲直，且先把战争行动停了再说。英国政府就是这种论调的鼓吹者。英国外交部发言人在二十八日评论新西兰的建议说，
  “我们的看法是，目标是简单的。我们不想把过去的事归咎于任何一方，也不想在将来损害任何一方的合法要求，我们希望这场战事尽早结束。”
    好一个“简单的”目标！英国政府明知是美国从五千多英里以外来干涉中国内政，侵略中国领土，威胁中国安全，但是它却要中国人民不问是非，停止解放沿海岛屿和台湾、澎湖。这显然是企图开脱美国的侵略责任，使美国对中国的侵略行为合法化。这也正是新西兰的建议的实际作用。
    新西兰的建议是中国人民决不能接受的。中国人民一定要解放沿海岛屿和台湾、澎湖。今天台湾地区的紧张局势，起因完全在于美国的武装干涉行为。新西兰如果真正关心远东地区的和平和安全，就应当要求联合国立即制止美国的侵略，立即要求美国停止在中国沿海地区的大规模战争挑衅和战争准备，从台湾地区撤出美国的一切武装力量，而不应当要求联合国干涉中国的内政，助长美国的侵略气焰。
