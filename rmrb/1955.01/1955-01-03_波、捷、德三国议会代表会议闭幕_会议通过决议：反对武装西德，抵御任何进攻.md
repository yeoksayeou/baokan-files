Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 1st: A meeting of representatives from the Parliament of the Polish People's Republic, the National Assembly of the Czechoslovak Republic, and the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic concluded in Prague on December 31, 1954. The meeting unanimously passed a resolution stating that the meeting was "convened to consider the situation related to the debates in the parliaments of certain Western European countries regarding the ratification of the Paris Agreements, and to express the will of their people to defend peace and oppose the revival of German militarism."

The resolution continued: "The representatives of the legislative assemblies of these three neighboring and friendly countries condemn the organizers and promoters of the rearmament of West Germany for exerting shameful pressure on Western European countries' parliaments to force them to ratify the Paris Agreements. This unprecedented pressure has recently intensified, flagrantly violating national dignity. This pressure, along with the behind-the-scenes conspiracies that enabled the Paris Agreements to be approved while disregarding the clear will of the people, makes it clear to the world that the plans of those who control the Paris Agreements are aggressive and hostile to the cause of peace.

The Paris Agreements violate the will and vital interests of the people. These agreements also violate existing international treaties and contain the danger of aggression by German militarism. The people of all countries demand peace, and they are increasingly determined to oppose the Paris Agreements; they do not want the revival of German militarism or the policy of establishing military blocs. The struggles in the parliaments of Western European countries show the determination of the people of European countries to eliminate the danger of a new war. The struggle against the Paris military agreements in the French Parliament has been particularly tenacious.

The tenacious struggle of the French people against the revival of their mortal enemy, German militarism, has resonated in the hearts of the people of our three countries. The people of our three countries are convinced that the result of the vote held under pressure on December 30, 1954, is not the end of this struggle. They believe that the French people, like the people of all other Western European countries, will continue their heroic struggle until their will is victorious.

The resistance of the progressive and peace-loving people of West Germany to the ratification of the Paris Agreements and the revival of German militarism is continuing to grow, and their opposition to Bonn's pro-American policy, which hinders the peaceful resolution of the German question, is also growing. The people of West Germany have a particularly important role to play in the great struggle of the people of European countries for independence and freedom, for peace and security.

The workers and peasants of Germany, the youth of Germany, the Catholics and Christians of Germany—the patriots of Germany—in the process of fighting against militarization and striving for the unity of their country in West Germany, are defending not only the vital interests of their people, but also the sacred cause of peace and independence for the people of the whole world.

The millions of peace-loving people who are fighting for peace and security in Europe can be assured that they will receive the friendship and active support of the working people of Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic, and the friendship and active support of other peace-loving countries.

The European conference on guaranteeing peace and security in Europe, held in Moscow, has pointed out the correct path towards a peaceful solution to the German question and towards guaranteeing peace in Europe and the security of the people of European countries. The security of the people of European countries will be guaranteed if a collective security system including all European countries—regardless of their social and political systems—is established, rather than military alliances of some countries against others.

The people of Czechoslovakia and Poland were the first victims of Hitler's aggression. Therefore, they have more right and more responsibility than anyone else to warn the people of European countries against the danger of the revival of West German aggressive forces, and to take all steps to ensure their security, so that the people of all countries do not have to suffer terrible pain again.

The danger posed by the restoration of the revenge-seeking "Wehrmacht" threatens the Polish People's Republic, the Czechoslovak Republic, and the German Democratic Republic. Therefore, they are fully determined to further expand their cooperation in all aspects and help each other. They will never relax their efforts to strengthen their friendship with the powerful Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other democratic countries, as well as all peace-loving countries. Like all countries in the peace camp, our three countries will never sit idly by and watch German militarism revive and become a weapon of renewed aggression. The people of our three countries are determined to take all necessary steps to ensure our independence, ensure our peaceful labor, and ensure the inviolability of our borders and territories once the Paris Agreements are ratified.

We, the members of the Parliament of the Polish People's Republic, the National Assembly of the Czechoslovak Republic, and the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, as true spokespersons and defenders of the interests of the people of our three countries, hereby declare: The people of our three countries must fully and effectively support our governments in implementing these measures.

The peace camp has never been as strong and united as it is now. No force can stop the liberated people from moving towards a happy future. The close cooperation of our three countries will give new strength to the struggle of the people of all countries for peace and will prove that the peace-loving people of all countries, through joint efforts, will surely find the path to friendly understanding.

Any attempts by German militarists, their American protectors, and their other accomplices to provoke war will surely meet a tragic fate.

The people of our three countries are always ready to defend their just cause, resist any aggression, and will spare no effort to make the policy of peaceful coexistence and cooperation among the people of all countries triumph over the policy of war."

    波、捷、德三国议会代表会议闭幕
    会议通过决议：反对武装西德，抵御任何进攻
   【新华社讯】塔斯社布拉格一日电：波兰人民共和国议会、捷克斯洛伐克共和国国民议会和德意志民主共和国人民议院的代表会议一九五四年十二月三十一日在布拉格闭幕，会议一致通过了一项决议，决议说，这个会议是“为了考虑同某些西欧国家议会进行批准巴黎协定的辩论有关的形势，并且表示他们的人民保卫和平和反对德国军国主义复活的意志而召开的。”
    决议继续说：“这三个相邻的、友好的国家的立法议会的代表谴责重新武装西德的组织者和推动者为了迫使西欧国家议会批准巴黎协定而对它们施加可耻的压力。这种前所未闻的压力近来已经特别加强了，这种压力粗暴地侵犯了民族尊严。这种压力和使巴黎协定得以在漠视各国人民明确意愿的情况下获得批准的幕后阴谋，使全世界清楚地看到，巴黎协定主使人的计划是侵略性的和敌视和平事业的。
    巴黎协定违反人民的意愿和切身利益。这些协定也违反现行的国际条约，而且包含着德国军国主义进行侵略的危险。各国人民要求和平，他们愈来愈坚决地反对巴黎协定，他们不要复活德国军国主义，也不要实行建立军事集团的政策。西欧各国议会中所进行的斗争，显示了欧洲各国人民坚决要消除一次新战争危险的决心。法国议会中反对巴黎军事协定的斗争特别顽强。
    法国人民反对他们的死敌德国军国主义的复活的顽强斗争已经在我们三国人民的心中引起了共鸣。我们三国人民深信，一九五四年十二月三十日在压力下所举行的投票的结果不是这个斗争的终结。他们相信，法国人民和西欧所有其他国家的人民一样，将继续进行英勇的斗争，直到他们的意愿得到胜利为止。
    西德进步和爱好和平的人民对批准巴黎协定和复活德国军国主义的抵抗正在继续不断地增长，他们对阻碍德国问题和平解决的波恩亲美政策的反对也在增长。西德人民在欧洲各国人民争取独立和自由、争取和平和安全的伟大斗争中要起特别重要的作用。
    德国的工人和农民，德国的青年，德国的天主教徒和基督教徒——德国的爱国人士——在西德进行反对军国主义化和争取他们国家的统一的斗争的过程中，保卫的不仅是他们人民的切身利益，而且还在保卫全世界人民的和平和独立的神圣事业。
    为欧洲的和平和安全而斗争的千百万爱好和平的人民可以确信，他们会得到波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和德意志民主共和国的劳动人民的友谊和积极支持，会得到其他爱好和平的各国人民的友谊和积极支持。
    在莫斯科举行的欧洲国家保障欧洲和平和安全会议已经指出了走向和平解决德国问题和走向保证欧洲和平和欧洲各国人民的安全的正确的道路。如果一个包括欧洲所有国家——不问其社会和政治制度如何——的集体安全体系，而不是某些国家反对另外一些国家的军事联盟建立了起来，欧洲各国人民的安全就会得到保证。
    捷克斯洛伐克和波兰的人民是希特勒侵略的最先受害者。因此，他们比任何人都有更大的权利和更大的责任向欧洲各国人民发出提防西德侵略势力复活危险的警告，并且采取保障他们的安全的一切步骤，以使各国人民不必再遭受可怕的痛苦。
    恢复寻求复仇的“国防军”而引起的危险威胁着波兰人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克共和国和德意志民主共和国。因此，它们有着充分的决心来进一步扩大它们在各方面的合作，并且互相帮助。它们决不放松为加强它们同强大的苏联、中华人民共和国和其他民主国家以及一切爱好和平的国家之间的友谊而作的努力。同和平阵营中的一切国家一样，我们三国决不会坐视德国军国主义恢复起来，成为重新侵略的武器。我们三国人民已经下定决心，一旦巴黎协定得到批准，就采取一切必要的步骤来保障我们的独立，保障我们的和平劳动和我们的边境和领土的不可侵犯性。
    我们，波兰人民共和国议会、捷克斯洛伐克共和国国民议会和德意志民主共和国人民议院的议员们，作为我们三国人民的利益的真正代言人和捍卫者，在这里宣布：我们三国人民一定完全地和有效地支持我们的政府来执行这些措施。
    和平阵营从来没有像现在这样的强大和团结一致。没有任何力量能够制止解放了的人民向着幸福的前途迈进。我们三国的密切合作将使得各国人民争取和平的斗争具有新的力量，并且将证明：一切国家的爱好和平的人民由于联合的努力一定会找到通往友好谅解的道路。
    德国军国主义者、他们的美国保护人和他们的其他同谋者的任何挑拨战争的企图一定会遭到可悲的命运。
    我们三国人民随时准备保卫他们的正义事业，抵御任何进攻，他们将不遗余力地使各国人民和平共处和合作的政策战胜战争政策。”
