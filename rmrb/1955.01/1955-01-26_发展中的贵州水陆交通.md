Developing Water and Land Transportation in Guizhou
Guizhou Provincial People's Government Transportation Department Office

Guizhou Province is a mountainous area, and transportation used to be extremely inconvenient. The main transportation network – highways – not only had very rudimentary roadbeds, surfaces, bridges, and culverts, but also had steep slopes and sharp curves, often leading to rollovers and accidents. In addition, the Kuomintang bandit troops carried out large-scale destruction during their retreat, so that by the time of liberation, there was not a single complete highway open to traffic in the entire province.

After liberation, the People's Government quickly repaired the original two thousand seven hundred kilometers of highways and rebuilt another one thousand one hundred kilometers. In 1953, four new highways and six wide post roads, totaling more than one thousand thirty kilometers, were built in various ethnic minority areas and remote mountainous areas. These newly built highways and post roads were mostly winding through high and cold mountainous areas and undulating mountain ranges, making the engineering extremely difficult. However, thanks to the active efforts of the vast number of road construction workers and the enthusiastic support of the people of all ethnic groups, these natural obstacles were finally overcome. During the construction of the most difficult Weishui Highway, a construction worker named Liu Zhaoquan took the lead in going into the water to repair culverts in the freezing winter. During the construction of the Huiluo Highway, construction workers from the Buyi, Miao, and other ethnic minorities launched a labor competition, creating and promoting advanced working methods such as wooden plank pushcarts, wooden stick sledges for transporting stones, and iron plows for shoveling soil, overcoming natural obstacles and the lack of tools. Some ethnic minority farmers also voluntarily organized road construction teams to participate in road construction, or took time to make straw sandals and weave dirt baskets to send to the construction site.

In 1954, the reconstruction project of the Qian-Gui Highway was completed, and now the Qian-Dian Highway has also started construction for reconstruction.

Due to the development of highway transportation, transportation capacity has increased, freight rates have decreased, and the face of traffic congestion in ethnic minority areas and remote areas of Guizhou Province has been greatly changed, which has prospered the mountain economy. At present, highways have been opened to 80% of the 79 counties where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities and scattered settlements. Iron, manganese, zinc, tung oil, wool, and kapok produced in the high and cold mountainous areas of western Guizhou Province, as well as flue-cured tobacco, medicinal materials, and timber produced in Kaili, Luodian, and other places, have been continuously transported out with the opening of highways. Salt, cloth, and daily necessities are continuously transported in. In 1953, the government distributed more than 455,700 catties of relief grain and agricultural loan grain in Weining, as well as 20,000 catties of iron (which was used to manufacture free agricultural tools for ethnic minorities), all of which were transported through the newly built highways. The bananas planted by the Buyi and Miao farmers in Luodian can also be transported to Guiyang and other places in time after the highways are opened. The ethnic minorities in Yewoping, Shanwangmiao, and other places between Weining and Shuicheng lacked salt the most. Because cars replaced human and animal transport, the freight rate per catty was reduced by 60%, so every household can now buy enough salt.

In order to ensure the safety of people and animals and facilitate agricultural production, Guizhou Province has also built many county and township roads. From 1953 to July 1954 alone, a total of 266 roads were built, with a total length of 1,619 kilometers and 307 bridges.

In terms of inland river navigation, there are 14 large navigable rivers in the province, but because the riverbeds are narrow and shallow, the water flow is too rapid, the shoals are dangerous, the reefs are intricate, and the rocks are towering and blocking the river surface, the transportation value is very small.

After liberation, the People's Government vigorously rectified the rivers. In the past few years, through focused blasting of reefs, dredging dangerous shoals, and opening up and repairing towpaths, the waterways have been widened and deepened, obstacles in the waterways have been eliminated, navigation safety has been ensured, transportation efficiency has been improved, and transportation costs have been reduced. For example, the Zhugedong shoal in the Puyang River, before the rectification, the shallowest draft during the dry season was only two inches, and the narrowest width was less than two meters. When ships with a load of three tons passed, the goods had to be unloaded and the ships had to be carried over, requiring a porterage fee of 16,000 yuan per ton. After the rectification, the shallowest draft can be maintained at six inches during the driest water level, and the width has been increased to eight meters. Moreover, the waterway is straight, and ships can come and go freely, reducing the porterage costs and the troublesome porterage procedures, and accelerating the turnover rate of ships. Taking the 99-kilometer voyage from Jiuzhou to Zhenyuan as an example, the operating cost has been reduced by 25%. In order to better dredge the river, the huge reef blasting project between Masangping and Erlangtan on the Chishui River started construction in October 1954. According to the construction plan, it will be completed by the end of this spring. After completion, not only can the more than 400 porters who originally made a living by porterage be put into other production, but also the economic value is very large. Taking only the salt transported upstream as an example, more than 400 million yuan in porterage and transshipment fees can be saved every year.

At present, after the rectification, the seven main rivers have a wooden boat navigation mileage of more than 1,900 kilometers and a raft navigation mileage of more than 2,200 kilometers within the province. In the past few years, on the transportation front, especially in the work of supporting the disaster areas in Hunan last year, waterway transportation in Guizhou has played a significant role.

In addition to vigorously rectifying rivers, since 1952, the People's Government has successively established shipping management agencies in various waterway areas, organizing scattered boatmen; through democratic reforms and other movements, feudal bosses were overthrown, exorbitant taxes and levies were abolished, and boatmen were freed from layers of shackles. The National Bank also provided loans to support them. This has completely changed the bleak and declining phenomenon of water transportation in Guizhou. Now the boatmen are carrying out the organization of wooden sailboats into groups and teams, advancing along the road of mutual assistance and cooperation.

In the next three years, water and land transportation in Guizhou Province will have further development. In terms of highway construction, the survey and design will be strengthened, the existing trunk highways and provincial and county highways and post roads will be improved, the standards and load-bearing capacity of highways and post roads will be improved, and new highways will be built in ethnic minority areas in the southeast, northwest, and northeast of the province. In terms of waterway construction, in addition to continuing to rectify rivers and gradually expand the managed routes, it is also necessary to try to use motorized boats to tow barges. By then, the lives of the people in the mountainous areas of Guizhou Province will be better than they are now. The saying that "there is no three miles of flat land" and "people have no three cents of silver" will also be shattered.

    发展中的贵州水陆交通
    贵州省人民政府交通厅办公室
    贵州省是山区，过去交通极不方便。主要运输网——公路，不仅路基、路面、桥梁、涵洞非常简陋，而且坡陡弯急，常常翻车肇事。加上国民党匪军溃退时大肆破坏，全省到解放时竟没有一条完整的通车的公路。
    解放以后，人民政府很快地修复了原有的两千七百多公里公路，又改建了一千一百多公里。一九五三年，又在各少数民族地区和边远山区新修了四条公路和六条宽阔的驿道，总长一千零三十多公里。这些新修的公路和驿道，大都是盘旋在崇山峻岭的高寒山区和山峦起伏的群山地带，工程十分艰巨。但是，由于广大筑路民工的积极努力和各族人民的热情支援，终于克服了这些自然障碍。在修筑最难修的威水公路时，民工刘昭全曾在结冰的严冬带头下水去抢修涵洞。在修筑惠罗公路的时候，布依、苗族等少数民族的民工展开了劳动竞赛，创造和推广了木板推车、木棍滑板运石、铁犁铲土等先进工作方法，克服了自然障碍和缺乏工具的困难。有些少数民族农民还自动组织筑路队参加筑路，或抽空打草鞋、编土箕送到工地来。
    一九五四年，黔桂公路的改建工程完工，现在黔滇公路又开始兴工改建了。
    由于公路交通的发展，增加了运输力，降低了运价，大大改变了贵州省少数民族地区和边远地区交通阻塞的面貌，繁荣了山区经济。现在全省七十九个少数民族聚居和散居的县份中，已有百分之八十修通了公路。贵州省西部高寒山区所产的铁、锰、锌、桐油、羊毛、木棉，和凯里、罗甸等地盛产的烤烟、药材、木材，已随着公路的修通而源源运出。盐巴、布匹、日用百货则源源运进。一九五三年，政府在威宁发放的四十五万五千七百多斤救济粮和农贷粮，以及两万斤铁（这是用来制造发给少数民族的无偿农具的），也都是通过新修的公路运去的。罗甸布依、苗族农民种植的香蕉，在公路修通后，也都能及时运往贵阳各地。威宁水城间的野窝平、山王庙等地少数民族最缺少的食盐，因为有了汽车代替人背马驮，每斤运价降低了百分之六十，因此家家户户都已能买到足够的食盐。
    为了保障人畜安全，便利农业生产，贵州省还修了不少县乡村大道，仅一九五三年到一九五四年七月这一期间，修好的大道就共有二百六十六条，长达一千六百一十九公里，桥梁三百零七座。
    在内河航运方面，全省较大的可以通航的河流有十四条，但因为河床浅窄，水流过急，滩险踵接，暗礁交错，岩石耸叠，横堵江面，所以运输价值很小。
    解放以后，人民政府即大力整治河道。几年来，经过有重点地炸礁，淘漕险滩，开辟和整修纤道，使航道加宽加深，扫除了航道中的障碍，保证了航行安全，提高了运输效率，降低了运输成本。如?阳河的诸葛洞滩险，在没有整治以前，枯水期的最浅航深只有两公寸，航宽最窄处还不到两公尺，载重三吨的船只经过，必须把货物卸下来把船搬过去，每吨需要搬滩费一万六千元。整治后，最枯水位时期最浅航深能保持六公寸，航宽增至八公尺，而且航道平直，船只来往自如，减去了搬滩费用和麻烦的搬滩手续，加速了船只运转率。以旧州到镇远九十九公里的航程为例，运转成本就降低了百分之二十五。为了更好地疏浚河道，赤水河马桑坪至二郎滩间的巨大炸礁工程又在一九五四年十月开工了。按施工计划，将在今年春末竣工。竣工后，不仅原来以搬滩为生的四百多搬滩工人可以投入其他生产，而且经济价值很大，仅就上水物资食盐一项计算，每年就可节省搬滩转驳费四亿余元。
    现在，经过整治的七条主要河流，在全省境内已有木船航运里程一千九百多公里，通筏航程长二千二百多公里。几年来，在运输战线上，特别是在去年支援湖南灾区的运粮工作中，贵州的水路运输起了很大的作用。
    除了大力整治河道以外，从一九五二年开始，人民政府又先后在各个航道地区设立了航运管理机构，把分散的船民组织起来；通过民主改革等运动，斗倒了封建把头，取缔了苛捐杂税，使船民摆脱了层层枷锁。国家银行又发放贷款加以扶持。这样就使贵州的水运，完全改变了萧条没落的现象。现在船民们正在进行木帆船的编组编队工作，沿着互助合作的道路前进。
    今后的三年内，贵州省的水陆交通将有进一步的发展。在公路建设方面，将加强勘测设计，改进现有各条公路干线及省县公路和驿道，提高公路和驿道的标准和载重量，并在省东南、西北、东北部等少数民族地区修筑新的公路。在航道建设方面，除继续整治河道，逐步扩大管理航线外，还要试办用机动船来拖带驳船。到那时，贵州省山区人民的生活将比现在更好。“地无三里平”、“人无三分银”的说法也将被粉碎。
