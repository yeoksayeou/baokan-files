    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 29th: TASS Berlin reported on the 28th that the Central Committee of the German Communist Party (DKP) held a press conference in Bonn on the 27th. At the conference, the Communist Party's formal statement to the Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe was distributed, demanding an immediate halt to the persecution of the DKP.
    Max Schäfer stated at the press conference that the development of the situation increasingly clearly demonstrates that the Karlsruhe trial is incompatible with the demand for free all-German elections and the reunification of Germany. Therefore, the DKP declares that the trial, scheduled to continue on January 31st, is unacceptable. In mentioning the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on January 25th, Schäfer emphasized that the end of the state of war between the Soviet Union and Germany is another step towards the reunification of Germany.

    就加尔斯卢合联邦宪法法院对德共的迫害
    德国共产党中央委员会发表严正声明
    【新华社二十九日讯】　据塔斯社柏林二十八日讯：德意志通讯社报道，德国共产党中央委员会二十七日在波恩举行记者招待会。会上散发了共产党向加尔斯卢合联邦宪法法院提出的必须立即停止对德国共产党的迫害的正式声明。
    马克斯·谢菲尔在记者招待会上发表谈话说，局势的发展越来越明确地证明加尔斯卢合的审讯是和全德自由选举和重新统一德国的要求不相容的。因此，德国共产党宣布，预定在一月三十一日继续举行的审讯是不能容许的。谢菲尔在提到苏联最高苏维埃主席团一月二十五日的命令时着重指出，结束苏联同德国之间的战争状态是走向重新统一德国的又一步骤。
