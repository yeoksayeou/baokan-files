Recently, art units and artists in the capital are creating propaganda works against the United States' occupation of our territory Taiwan and exposing the aggressive nature of the U.S.-Chiang treaty. Before the new year, the painting, cartoon, and printmaking groups of the Chinese Artists Association's Creation Committee launched a campaign among artists in Beijing to create works on this theme. Teachers and students of the Central Academy of Fine Arts used the New Year's Day holiday for a concentrated creative effort. The painting department has completed 14 large-format oil painting propaganda posters, the printmaking department has drawn and printed more than 60 prints, and the sculpture department has completed 15 sets of cartoon-style small-scale colored clay sculptures. These works have been displayed in the windows of Xinhua bookstores, China Department Stores, the Art Service Department of the Chinese Artists Association, and various supply and marketing cooperative outlets in the capital. The Central Academy of Fine Arts is also planning to create four giant oil painting propaganda posters, eight meters high and six meters wide, to be hung on the arrow towers of Qianmen, Xizhimen, etc., to conduct propaganda and education on the liberation of Taiwan to the general public. Painters from the People's Fine Arts Publishing House's Creation Studio and the Beijing People's Fine Arts Studio are all rushing to paint propaganda posters with the theme of "We must liberate Taiwan." The People's Fine Arts Publishing House plans to create five paintings and has completed two, while the Beijing People's Fine Arts Studio plans to create ten, most of which have been completed. These propaganda posters will be printed and published by Xinhua Bookstore for sale. The cartoon group of the Chinese Artists Association's Creation Committee and the People's Daily Art Group jointly convened cartoonists from all over the capital on New Year's Eve to mobilize and organize creation. On January 4th and 12th, they also held successive original manuscript observation and research sessions. The completed cartoon works have been published successively by various newspapers and periodicals in Beijing. Some shops in the capital's stations and streets have automatically enlarged, colored, posted, and exhibited the published cartoons, which has had a significant propaganda effect.
