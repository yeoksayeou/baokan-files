Far-Sighted Planning, Overall Coordination
Tian Fu

    The experience of "overall planning" in the cooperative movement in rural areas initiated in Xiqin Village and other places in Shuangcheng County, Heilongjiang Province (see the report by Comrade Chen Wenzhi published in today's newspaper) is an important method for realizing the principle of "relying on the masses, preparing year-round, preparing a batch, developing a batch, and building cooperatives while consolidating them."

    Implementing overall planning for the cooperative movement in every village (Note: A village in the Northeast region is equivalent to a township in other regions) facilitates making the agricultural cooperative movement a mass movement of self-transformation by the broad masses of peasants under the leadership of the Party. Doing so can closely combine the plans of county and district leading organs with the demands of the masses, so that the plans of the leading organs are practical and have a mass foundation, and the demands of the masses receive correct leadership and strong support. This can avoid blindness on the part of the leadership and spontaneity on the part of the masses; it can not only overcome the conservatism or laissez-faire thinking of some comrades, but also prevent the tendency of rash advance and commandism. At the same time, it can fully utilize the experience and wisdom of the masses and give full play to the initiative and enthusiasm of grassroots organizations and the broad masses.

    Implementing this overall planning can better and more comprehensively implement the Party's class policy in rural work. On the one hand, it can avoid excluding poor or middle peasants, and avoid the phenomenon of middle peasants organizing "middle peasant cooperatives" and poor peasants organizing "poor peasant cooperatives." On the other hand, since most poor households have joined the cooperatives, and those who are temporarily unwilling to join have also participated in mutual aid teams under overall arrangements, the opportunities for rich peasants to exploit loopholes are reduced, and the activities of rural capitalist forces can be more effectively restricted.

    Implementing this overall planning, the work of developing agricultural production cooperatives can be carried out in an orderly and prepared manner, and it can be carried out more carefully throughout the year, avoiding the problems that may occur with hasty responses and short-term crash efforts. Without sufficient preparation in advance, concentrating on building cooperatives in the winter makes it impossible to guarantee the quality of the cooperatives and easily leads to contradictions with the unified purchase and sale of grain and other agricultural products. Overall planning and year-round cooperative construction can not only prevent these problems, but also make the preparatory work for cooperative construction a force to promote the production increase movement.

    The great development of the cooperative movement requires us to be far-sighted and coordinate the overall situation: we must see the new cooperatives that are being established, and also see the old cooperatives; we must take into account the consolidation and expansion of the old cooperatives, and also take into account the establishment and development of new cooperatives; we must run the existing cooperatives well, and also pay attention to the development and improvement of the reserve force of cooperatives—mutual aid teams; we must run production cooperation well, and also run supply and marketing cooperation and credit cooperation well; we must consider the reality, and also consider the prospect of development. Without overall planning, not only will we "attend to one thing and lose sight of another," but we will lose "the other" and damage "this." Therefore, the experience of Xiqin Village in leading the cooperative movement with the method of overall planning is worthy of universal promotion.

    In adopting this method of overall planning, special attention should be paid to implementing the mass line and strengthening the Party's leadership. The essence of this method is the combination of leadership and the masses; without the mass line, this method will be worthless. The work of overall planning must be done by the masses themselves under the leadership of the Party branch and the district and township leading organs; the masses must be constantly educated on the Party's class policy and cooperative policy, so that the overall planning is based on the conscious and voluntary participation of the masses. The county leading organs should strengthen specific leadership over the overall planning work of the cooperative movement in each village in coordination with the district leading organs; otherwise, relying solely on the rural Party branches can never complete this arduous task.

    深谋远虑，统筹全局
    田夫
    黑龙江省双城县希勤村等地创始的在农村合作化运动中实行“全面规划”的经验（见今天本报登载的陈文志同志的报道），是实现“依靠群众，常年准备；准备一批，发展一批；一边建社，一边巩固”的办社方针的一个重要的方法。
    在各个乡村实行合作化运动的全面规划
  （按：东北地区的村，相当于其他地区的乡），便于使农业合作化运动真正成为广大农民群众在党的领导下进行自我改造的群众运动。这样做，可以把县区领导机关的计划和群众的要求密切结合起来，使领导机关的计划切合实际、有群众基础，使群众的要求得到正确的领导、有力的支持。这样做，就能避免领导方面的盲目性和群众方面的自发性；既可以克服某些同志的保守主义或放任自流的思想，又可以防止急躁冒进、强迫命令的偏向。同时，可以充分运用群众的经验和智慧，发挥基层组织和广大群众的主动性、积极性。
    实行这种全面规划，可以更好地全面地贯彻党在农村工作中的阶级政策。一方面，可以避免排斥贫农或中农，避免中农组织“中农社”、贫农组织“贫农社”的现象。另方面，由于贫困户大都入社了，暂时不愿入社的也都在全面安排下参加了互助组，就使富农钻空子的机会减少了，就能更有力地限制农村资本主义势力的活动。
    实行这种全面规划，发展农业生产合作社的工作就能有秩序地有准备地进行，就能常年地比较细致地进行，避免仓卒应战和短期突击可能发生的毛病。事先没有充分准备，集中在冬季突击建社，就无法保证社的质量，并且容易和统购统销等工作发生矛盾。全面规划，常年建社，不但可以防止这些毛病，并且可以使建社准备工作成为推动增产运动的力量。
    合作化运动的大发展，要求我们深谋远虑，统筹全局：要看到正在建立的新社，也要看到老社；要顾及老社的巩固和扩大，也要顾及新社的建立和发展；要办好现有的合作社，也要注意到合作社的后备力量——互助组的发展和提高；要办好生产合作，也要办好供销合作和信用合作；要考虑现实问题，也要考虑发展远景。如果没有全面规划，不但会“顾此失彼”，而且会失“彼”损“此”。因此，希勤村用全面规划的办法领导合作化运动的经验是值得普遍推广的。
    采用这种全面规划的方法，应当特别注意贯彻群众路线，特别注意加强党的领导。这个方法的精髓就是领导和群众相结合；离开了群众路线，这个方法就会毫无价值。全面规划的工作，必须在党的支部和区乡领导机关的领导下，由群众自己来做；必须不断对群众进行党的阶级政策和合作化方针的教育，使全面规划建立在群众自觉自愿的基础上。县的领导机关要协同区的领导机关，对各村的合作化运动全面规划工作加强具体领导；否则，仅仅依靠乡村党的支部，绝不能完成这种艰巨的任务。
