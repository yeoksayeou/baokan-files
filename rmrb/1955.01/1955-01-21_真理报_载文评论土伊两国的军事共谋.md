Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 19th: Medvedev wrote an article in "Pravda" commenting on the Turkish-Iraqi military conspiracy. The article states that, as can be seen from the official communique issued by the Turkish and Iraqi governments in Ankara and Baghdad on January 12th, the only result of the talks between Turkish Prime Minister Menderes and Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri Said was the preparation for a war alliance between the two countries, an alliance that the United States has long sought to achieve.

The broad public, closely watching the conspiracies of the enemies of peace, is not surprised by the outcome of the Turkish-Iraqi talks. The Lebanese newspaper "Al Khabar" described Menderes as a "special envoy" of the ruling circles of the United States. It wrote: "Undoubtedly, American and British imperialists, despite their differences on the issue of oil and political control in the Near East, are exerting strong pressure on Arab countries to bind them to imperialist war plans and turn the Near East into a military base for the aggressive war they are preparing..."

Medvedev continued, everyone knows that US Secretary of State Dulles insisted as early as last year on establishing war blocs in areas close to the Soviet border. After the failure of the American imperialists to establish the so-called Middle East Command, they adopted a roundabout approach. They began to piece together an aggressive "regional treaty" system, drawing one country after another into war alliances, thereby making these alliances part of or connected to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Medvedev said that Menderes's travels among the countries of the Near and Middle East are aimed at piecing together a bloc against the Soviet Union, following foreign instructions. However, it must be pointed out that such activities by the Turkish Prime Minister are not in Turkey's interests. The efforts of Menderes and Nuri Said to piece together aggressive blocs can only lead to a further escalation of international tensions and a deterioration of relations between Arab Eastern countries. Medvedev wrote that the organizers of these blocs and their agents should remember that the Soviet public cannot ignore the conspiracies carried out by American and British aggressors and their followers on the Soviet border.

    “真理报”载文评论土伊两国的军事共谋
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十九日讯：麦德维杰夫在“真理报”撰文评论土耳其—伊拉克的军事共谋。文章说，从一月十二日安卡拉和巴格达发表的土耳其和伊拉克两国政府的正式公报可以看出，土耳其总理曼德列斯同伊拉克首相努里·赛义德会谈的唯一结果是这两国之间准备缔结一个战争联盟，而这个联盟是美国长期以来一直力图实现的。
    密切注视和平的敌人的阴谋的广大公众，对于土耳其—伊拉克会谈的结果毫不感到惊奇。黎巴嫩“消息报”把曼德列斯形容为美国统治集团的“密使”。它写道：“无疑地，美英帝国主义者，尽管在近东的石油和政治控制问题上存在着分歧，但正在对阿拉伯国家施加强大压力，以便把它们束缚到帝国主义的战争计划上去，并把近东变成为它们正准备进行的侵略战争的一个军事基地……”
    麦德维杰夫接着说，大家都知道，美国国务卿杜勒斯早在去年就坚持在紧靠着苏联边界的地区建立战争集团。美帝国主义者在建立所谓中东司令部遭到失败后，采取了一种迂回手段。它们开始拼凑一个侵略性的“区域性条约”体系，把一个国家又一个国家拉入战争联盟，从而使这些联盟成为北大西洋公约组织的一部分或是同它发生联系。
    麦德维杰夫说，曼德列斯在中近东国家中旅行，是奉外国的指示在努力拼凑反对苏联的集团。但是，必须指出，土耳其总理的这种活动是不符合土耳其的利益的。曼德列斯和努里·赛义德拼凑侵略性集团的努力只能导向进一步加剧国际紧张局势，和阿拉伯东方国家之间的关系的恶化。麦德维杰夫写道，这些集团的组织者和他们的代理人应该记住，苏联公众不能对美英侵略分子和他们的追随者在苏联边界进行的阴谋置之不理。
