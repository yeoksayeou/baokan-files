Beijing and Shanghai are designing a complete set of new Chinese printing and dyeing machinery and equipment with the help of eighty textile machinery technicians. In the design office of the Textile Machinery Manufacturing Bureau of the Ministry of Textile Industry, various drawings of printing and dyeing machines are placed on the tables, and many technicians who just learned to design textile machines two or three years ago are carrying out this new and difficult task. By the end of last year, nineteen kinds of general-purpose machines and components had been designed, five of which are already being trial-produced.

A complete set of printing and dyeing equipment consists of fifty-seven kinds of combined machines, engraving equipment and main auxiliary equipment. A combined machine includes several to a dozen different unit machines. Among these combined machines, there are printing combined machines that can print four to eight colors; there are bleaching combined machines that can continuously produce bleached cloth; there are continuous pad-dyeing combined machines for dyeing cloth and new-style boiling cloth combined machines required for cotton cloth refining projects, and so on. All equipment has reasonable, centrally controlled electrical automatic speed regulation and control devices.

The finalization and design of new printing and dyeing machines has concentrated the wisdom of experienced domestic printing and dyeing, textile machinery engineering and technical personnel, and has been directly assisted by Soviet experts.

After the successful trial production of a complete set of printing and dyeing equipment, it can print and dye various colored linen, plain cloth, khaki and serge fabrics, which will supply all the equipment needed for China's first newly built printing and dyeing factory - the state-owned Beijing No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory.

Trial production of the main machinery and equipment will begin in March this year.

    北京上海正设计全套新型印染设备
    北京、上海有八十多位纺织机械技术人员正在设计我国全套新型的印染机器设备。在纺织工业部纺织机械制造局设计室里的桌上，放着各种印染机器的图样，许多在两三年前刚学会设计纺织机器的技术人员，正在进行着这项新的困难的工作。到去年年底为止，已有十九种通用机器和机件设计完毕，其中有五种已在试制。
    全套印染设备由五十七种联合机器、雕刻设备和主要辅助设备组成。一台联合机包括有几种到十几种不同的单元机器。在这些联合机器中，有可以印四色到八色的印花联合机；有可以连续进行漂白布生产的漂白联合机；有染色布的连续轧染联合机和棉布精练工程中所需的新式煮布联合机等等。全部设备都有着合理的、集中控制的电气自动调速和操纵装置。
    新型印染机器的定型和设计工作，集中了国内有经验的印染、纺织机械工程技术人员们的智慧，并且得到了苏联专家的直接帮助。
    全套印染设备试制成功以后，可以印染各色麻纱、平布、卡其和哔叽等布匹，它将供给我国新建的第一个印染工厂——国营北京第一印染厂所需的全部设备。
    今年三月份起，主要机器设备将开始试制。
