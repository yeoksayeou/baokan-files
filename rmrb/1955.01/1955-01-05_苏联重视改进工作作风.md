    The Soviet Union Emphasizes Improving Work Style
    By Our Correspondent Li He
    Since the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, one of the most impressive new phenomena in the Soviet Union has been the emphasis placed by the Soviet Party and government on improving work style, and the unyielding struggle of Soviet Party, government, and mass organization workers to master the Leninist work style. Due to the improvement of work style, all aspects of communist construction are more active and vigorous than before.
    The Soviet Union is bravely advancing towards communism. The Soviet Party and government face the enormous tasks of completing the Fifth Five-Year Plan, rapidly and extensively developing agriculture and consumer goods industries, and better meeting the material and cultural needs of all the people. To ensure the smooth completion of these historic tasks, the improvement of work style has received due attention.
    Improving work style relies on bravely taking up the time-tested weapon of criticism and self-criticism. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union teaches people that open criticism precisely demonstrates the strength of the socialist system, and open criticism will not weaken but strengthen its own forces. Comrade Khrushchev said: "We must boldly and resolutely expose and eliminate shortcomings. We must remember that only in this way can we improve all our work. We don't have to worry that open criticism of shortcomings will temporarily provide the enemies of the Soviet state, those with malicious intentions, with materials for schadenfreude, enabling them to shout that the Soviet Union is weakening as we expose shortcomings. Our people have a good saying: 'The dogs bark, but the caravan moves on.' We don't have to pay attention to the enemy's vicious rumors." (Comrade Khrushchev's report at the February-March 1954 Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee)
    In the past year, the Soviet Union has severely criticized the bureaucratic work style that exists in some links of the Party and state organs. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union regards bureaucratic style as the Party's mortal enemy, because bureaucracy separates the Party from the masses, prevents leaders from hearing the voices of the masses, stifles the creativity of the masses, and deprives the revolutionary cause of vitality. Bureaucracy no longer has a social foundation in the Soviet Union, which has no exploiting classes, but the remnants of capitalist ideology are still a breeding ground for bureaucracy. Bureaucracy cannot be eliminated by one or two movements. Lenin repeatedly pointed out: "The struggle against bureaucracy requires decades." Therefore, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has always strived to absorb the broad masses of working people to participate in state management, and never relaxes its efforts to resolutely combat bureaucracy head-on.
    In the Soviet Union, any organ of the Party and the state, no matter how great its achievements, is not allowed to be contaminated by bureaucratic habits. In February 1954, the CPSU Central Committee's letter to all voters stated: "The Party has been carrying out and will continue to carry out an irreconcilable struggle to eliminate various manifestations of bureaucracy and red tape in some links of the Soviet organs, and to correct the attitude of indifference and contempt towards the needs and opinions of the working people." In October 1954, the slogans of the CPSU Central Committee to welcome the October Revolution Festival called on the workers of state organs to improve the work of state organs and eliminate bureaucracy and procrastination. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union teaches people that opposing bureaucracy cannot rely solely on resolutions and calls, but must strengthen the inspection of implementation, implement dual pressure from top to bottom and from bottom to top, especially criticism from bottom to top, expose specific representatives of bureaucracy, and resolutely, continuously, and patiently wage an irreconcilable struggle against bureaucracy.
    The decision made by the CPSU Central Committee in January 1954 on "Serious Shortcomings in the Work of Party and State Organs" pointed out that the essence of these shortcomings lies in the fact that the main attention and the strength of the organ staff are often not concentrated on concrete and living work, but on the compilation of a large number of various instructions, resolutions, certificates, letters, and reports. This style of work only leads to confusion, procrastination, and irresponsibility in solving important problems, and only makes the organization bloated and the personnel divorced from practical organizational work.
    Opposing the style of paperwork and formalism is the first point that the Soviet Union has paid attention to in opposing bureaucracy in the past year. After the CPSU Central Committee made the above decision, many Party and state organs took concrete measures to eliminate the method of leading by paperwork, reduce redundant official documents and reports, and strengthen the living leadership of lower-level work. However, criticism has not been relaxed. Comrade Khrushchev criticized some state party committee secretaries and Soviet executive committee chairmen at the February 1954 plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee for not eradicating paperwork. He pointed out: "Some leaders are so fascinated by convening meetings and issuing countless documents that they lose the ability to analyze actual things and judge the situation solely by reports. They themselves are endlessly immersed in drafting instructions, and at the same time force others to do so, requiring others to answer their instructions." Comrade Khrushchev criticized the formalism in organizing competitions at the April 1954 session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. He pointed out: "Some enterprises have stipulated many forms of report competition, and formulated many conceived conventions, which resulted in stifling the creativity and initiative of the masses. In order to summarize the competition, the Kharkov Bicycle Factory formulated dozens of various report forms. Only according to one of the report forms on the promotion of advanced labor methods, each workshop must fill out a monthly report form including more than one thousand questions. As a result, dozens of staff members could not do useful things, but were busy compiling and integrating these forms." The magazine "Party Life" criticized the reporting system of the Tula Coal Mine United Enterprise in June 1954. According to the regulations of this united enterprise, its subordinate enterprises must submit a mine inspection report, including eighty-one questions; a cash audit report, including one hundred and thirty-five questions; and a depreciation deduction report, including about two hundred questions. There are more than seventy kinds of accounting reports that have not been approved by the Ministry of Coal Industry and the trade union. These reports overwhelmed the organs, making them unable to work efficiently.
    Streamlining organizations is another point that the Soviet Union has paid attention to in opposing bureaucracy. In the spring of 1954, some government departments were criticized for streamlining slowly. Comrade Khrushchev criticized the large size of the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture at the session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. At that time, it had four hundred and twenty bureaus, departments, and sections, and one out of every two staff members was a leader. In order to enable the government ministries to effectively lead their departments and the enterprises under their jurisdiction, the Soviet Union reduced the size of many ministries. However, after the division, the number of personnel in the organizations under the leadership of these new ministries was not allowed to exceed the number of staff originally in the original ministries before the division.
    Opposing the substitution of lower levels is another point that the Soviet Union has paid attention to in opposing bureaucracy. Each link, each staff member, should be fully responsible for what they do, and should have initiative. This is an important condition for improving the style of work. The Soviet organs implement democratic centralism, and it is not to concentrate the things that should be solved by the lower-level organs and personnel in the hands of the higher-level organs and personnel. A bureau director of the Soviet Ministry of Chemical Industry drafted a work memo, which stated the things entrusted to himself and the factories he managed, and submitted it to the minister for signature. The deputy directors of the other two bureaus also drafted memos to themselves and submitted them to the minister for signature. Chemical Minister Tikhomirov returned these memos to the drafters and asked them to solve the problems themselves, because these things should have been their direct responsibility. The minister informed the Party Committee of the Ministry of Chemical Industry of this fact. Therefore, the Party Committee meeting discussed the issue of improving the sense of responsibility of the staff. This approach has played a good role in overcoming the phenomenon of shirking responsibility.
    Opposing the formalism that disregards specific conditions is another point that the Soviet Union has paid attention to in opposing bureaucracy. Facts have proved that mechanically applying a set of principles and methods without studying local characteristics and specific conditions will ruin good things. A few years ago, the Soviet collective farms were merged into large collective farms, which facilitated the better use of modern agricultural technology. However, some collective farms were separated by lakes or forests, and forcibly merging them would increase difficulties. But some workers knew that it was not beneficial, but did not dissuade them from merging. The February-March 1954 Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee criticized the Soviet State Planning Commission, the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture, and the Soviet Ministry of State Farms for mechanically adopting the grass-grain rotation system everywhere in the past, which affected the planting area and yield of grain. According to the instructions of the CPSU Central Committee, the Soviet Union increased the planting of grains to replace perennial pastures. The recent proposal of Maltsev's new cultivation method has opened up a broad road for increasing grain production. However, Soviet agricultural workers are now not copying Maltsev's cultivation method, but carefully studying how to make Maltsev's cultivation method applicable to local specific conditions, and studying the problems to be solved such as preventing pests and applying fertilizers when adopting Maltsev's cultivation method.
    In the past year, the Soviet Party and government have taken many effective measures to improve the work style and methods of the Party and state organs, such as: implementing a new working day system to bring certain management departments closer to production; requiring agricultural scientific research institutions and experimental stations to be located where the plants they are studying grow; and requiring leading workers to truly go to the masses.
    Not general, superficial leadership, but concrete and in-depth leadership - this is the work style and method that the Soviet Union has been promoting recently.
    Further development of agriculture has been the central task of the Soviet Party and government since it was put forward at the September 1953 Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee. From this aspect, we can most clearly see the improvement of work style and methods.
    Not long ago, collective farm members' congresses in various parts of the Soviet Union were discussing the issue of stipulating the differentiated minimum labor days (each collective farm member in the Soviet Union must do a certain minimum number of labor days of work each year). Some collective farm members' congresses believed that the minimum labor days for female farm members could be set lower than for male farm members. A Party state committee secretary believed that this violated the principle of equality between men and women, so he came out to interfere. In fact, the farm members were taking care of the female farm members because they saw that the female farm members had to spend a lot of time on housework. This example shows that the Party state committee secretary did not go deep into the specific life.
    The September 1953 and February-March 1954 Plenary Sessions of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Central Committee repeatedly required the Party and Soviet workers of the state and districts to improve the style and methods of leading agricultural work. They were required to thoroughly understand their tasks, be familiar with the production situation in the countryside, go deep into the collective farmers, understand the needs of the masses, and work with them. They were required to prevent the state committees from being careless, and not to replace the practical help to the collective farms with declarations and movements, to abandon general leadership methods, to eradicate the superficial leadership style, to study the situation deeply, and to carry out concrete leadership on the basis of being proficient in business.
    Concrete leadership means providing practical guidance to people on the spot: not only telling people what to do, but also telling people how to do it, why they should do it, and why it should be completed within a certain period. Recently, Soviet Party workers have gone to lower-level organizations more often than last year, and stayed in lower-level organizations for a longer time. For example, the eleven instructors of the Party, Trade Union, and Youth League Organs Department of the Molotov State Committee of the CPSU went to the districts thirty-one times in two and a half months, staying a total of two hundred and fifty days. The staff of the city committees and district committees of this state rarely sit in the office. The plenary session of the state committee of this state discussed the situation of implementing the decisions of the September and February-March plenary sessions of the CPSU Central Committee. After that, the secretary of the state committee explained the current work to the staff of the state committee in detail, and explained the tasks of taking care of crops, preparing for harvesting, and storing feed with concrete examples. The meeting decided that the ministers and instructors of the state committee and the secretaries of the district committees should go to each collective farm to help them organize these tasks. Such on-the-spot organization of work enabled the district committee secretaries, collective farm chairmen, and agricultural technicians to accumulate good experience with the help of the state committee staff.
    The improvement of work style and methods has greatly developed agriculture in the Chkalov State.
    Chkalov State is a large agricultural state in the southwest of the Urals. The state's leading organs received the task of reclaiming 700,000 hectares of wasteland in 1954-55. The workers of the whole state supported the proposal of the state's Party Congress and guaranteed to reclaim 1 million hectares of wasteland. The state's agricultural workers also undertook the task of continuously improving crop yields. These tasks required the state's Party, Soviet, and agricultural organs to improve the leadership of agriculture, to concentrate their efforts on organizing work and mobilizing the masses to solve problems in agricultural production. They did exactly that.
    In accordance with the spirit of the Party Central Committee's plenary session on strengthening the link of the districts, the Party State Committee selected many Party members with political awareness and organizational ability to go to the agricultural districts, including many staff members of the Party State Committee organs. The quality of the leading staff in the districts has been significantly enhanced.
    In the past, there were many agricultural technicians in the state, most of whom were in the organs writing resolutions, issuing instructions, and convening meetings, but they did not go to production to organize work. After the September 1953 Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee, the agricultural technicians went to the countryside (industrial technicians also went to the countryside, and a large number of young and vigorous people from other states also came to reclaim wasteland), and the Party State Committee sent people to the collective farms to help the technicians on the spot.
    The Party State Committee and the District Committee went deep into the collective farms. With their help, the vast majority of the collective farms selected people with leadership experience and familiarity with agriculture to be the collective farm chairmen. After the selection, the state's collective farm chairmen's training course was also organized to help them exchange experience and discuss major issues in collective farm construction. The secretary and members of the Party State Committee and the members of the State Soviet Executive Committee participated in many collective farm members' congresses. They had many conversations with the farm members. Direct contact with the farm member masses made it easy for them to understand the emotions and demands of the collective farmers, and made it easy for them to correct the shortcomings in their leadership work and the work of the district-level organs.
    The spring of 1954 came late, and the climatic conditions were not good, but the vast majority of machine tractor stations, collective farms, and state farms in the whole district completed the sowing of grain in eight to ten working days, and the grain sowing area was expanded by 370,000 hectares compared with last year. During the spring sowing period, the Party State Committee strengthened the living contact with the districts: the secretary, members, and ministers of the State Committee, and the members of the State Soviet Executive Committee and other responsible staff members, were all in the districts, tractor stations, and state farms. They went to the earliest sowing districts first. Therefore, the problems that occurred at the beginning were overcome, and experience was accumulated to prevent the occurrence of serious shortcomings in other districts that were sown later.
    After the spring sowing, the living contact between the state's leading workers and the districts continued. A system was established: work groups led by responsible staff members of the Party State Committee were sent out to help the district committees for a long time. Special attention was paid to helping the district committees whose leaders were relatively young. The State Committee resolutely opposed the bad habit of calling the district-level staff to the state center without restriction. The State Committee required the state-level leading organs to organize work in this way, not to call people from the local areas, but for the state staff to go to the local areas themselves and solve the problems on the spot.
    The Party State Committee and the State Soviet Executive Committee gave living practical help to the backward agricultural districts, enabling them to overcome the phenomenon of backwardness. The cadres and technical equipment in these districts were strengthened. Work groups of Party and Soviet workers and agricultural technicians were sent to help the district committees and the district Soviet executive committees.
    The whole state reorganized the district-level Party organs in accordance with the decision of the Party Central Committee, and established instructor groups led by a district committee secretary in the areas served by each machine tractor station. The instructors worked with the collective farm members and tractor drivers and combine harvester drivers. The instructors spent most of their time in tractor stations and collective farms, relying on the Party's primary organizations to give play to their initiative and enthusiasm.
    The decision of the Chkalov State Party Committee of the CPSU to get close to the decisive link of production is that the Party and Soviet workers go deep into the lower levels and the masses to realize concrete leadership. Such a work style and method is exactly what the Soviet Union has always advocated and particularly advocates today.

    苏联重视改进工作作风
    本报记者　李何
    自从苏联共产党第十九次代表大会以来，在苏联使人印象最深的新气象之一，是苏联党和政府对于改进工作作风的重视，是苏联党的、政府的和群众团体的工作者为掌握列宁主义的工作作风所作的不屈不挠的斗争。由于工作作风的改进，共产主义建设各方面比以前更加活跃，更加朝气蓬勃。
    苏联向着共产主义勇敢前进，苏联党和政府面临着完成第五个五年计划，迅速地大规模地发展农业和日用品工业，更好地满足全体人民的物质和文化需要的巨大任务。为了保证这些有历史意义的任务的顺利完成，工作作风的改进受到了应有的注意。
    改进工作作风，是依靠勇敢地拿起批评和自我批评这个久经考验的武器来实现的。苏联共产党教导人们说，公开批评正是表明社会主义制度的力量的强大，公开批评不但不会削弱而且会加强自己的力量。赫鲁晓夫同志说：“我们必须大胆地坚决地揭露并消灭缺点。必须记住，只有这样，我们才能改进我们的一切工作。我们不必担心公开批评缺点会暂时给苏维埃国家的敌人，给那些心怀恶意的人以幸灾乐祸的材料，使他们能够趁我们揭露缺点的机会，大叫苏联削弱了。我们人民说得好：‘狗尽管叫，马照样前进。’我们不必理会敌人的恶毒谣言。”（赫鲁晓夫同志在苏共中央一九五四年二、三月全会上的报告）
    这一年来，苏联严厉批评了党的机关和国家机关的某些环节中存在的官僚主义的工作作风。苏联共产党把官僚主义作风看作党的死敌。因为官僚主义使党脱离群众，使领导者听不见群众的呼声，使群众的创造性窒息，使革命事业失去生气。官僚主义在没有剥削阶级的苏联已经没有社会基础，但是资本主义思想意识的残余仍然是官僚主义的温床。官僚主义不是靠一次两次运动能够消灭的。列宁屡次指出：“和官僚主义作斗争需要几十年。”所以，苏联共产党向来努力吸收广大劳动群众参加国家管理，任何时候也不放松迎头痛击官僚主义。
    在苏联，党和国家的任何机关，不论成绩多大，是不允许沾染官僚主义习气的。一九五四年二月，苏共中央告全体选民书中说：“党已在进行而且还要继续进行不调和的斗争，以消除苏维埃机关的某些环节的各种官僚主义和繁文缛礼的表现作风，以纠正对劳动人民的需要和意见采取漠不关心和轻视的态度。”一九五四年十月，苏共中央迎接十月革命节的口号号召国家机关工作者们，改进国家机关的工作，铲除官僚主义和拖拉作风。苏联共产党教导人们：反对官僚主义不能仅仅依靠决议和号召，必须加强对执行情况的检查，施行自上而下和自下而上的双重压力，特别是自下而上的批评，揭发官僚主义的具体代表人物，坚决地、不断地、耐心地向官僚主义进行不调和的斗争。
    苏共中央在一九五四年一月所作的“关于党的机关和国家机关的工作中的严重缺点”的决定，指出这些缺点的实质在于：往往不是把主要的注意力和机关工作人员的力量集中在具体的、活生生的工作上，而集中在编制大量的各种指示、决议、证明书、信件和报告。这种作风只会产生在解决重要问题时的紊乱、拖拉和无人负责现象，只会使机构臃肿，使人员脱离实际的组织工作。
    反对文牍作风，反对形式主义的作风，这是苏联最近一年反对官僚主义中注意的第一点。在苏共中央作出了上述决定之后，许多党的和国家的机关采取了具体措施来排除文牍主义的领导方法，减少多余的公文和表报，加强对下层工作的活的领导。但是，批评没有放松过。赫鲁晓夫同志在一九五四年二月苏共中央全会上批评了某些州的党委书记和苏维埃执委会主席没有根绝文牍主义。他指出：“某些领导人醉心于召集会议和制发无数的文件，以致丧失了分析实际事物的能力，单靠表报来判断情况。他们自己漫无止境地埋头于草拟指令，同时还强迫别人这样作，要求别人回答自己的指令。”赫鲁晓夫同志在一九五四年四月苏联最高苏维埃会议上批评了组织竞赛中的形式主义。他指出：“有些企业规定了许多形形色色的报告竞赛的方式，订立了不少想出来的公约，结果扼杀了群众的创造性和主动性。哈尔科夫自行车工厂为了总结竞赛，制订了数十种各式各样的报告形式，仅仅根据其中一种关于推广先进劳动方法的报告形式，每个车间每月必须填一张包括一千多个问题的月报表。这一来，有数十名工作人员就不能去干有用的事情，而为编制和综合这些表格忙得满头大汗。”“党的生活”杂志在一九五四年六月间批评了土拉煤矿联合企业的汇报制度。按照这个联合企业规定，它所属的各企业必须交一种矿井检查报告，包括八十一个问题；一种现金审查报告，包括一百三十五个问题；一种折旧扣除额报告，包括约二百个问题。未经煤矿工业部和工会批准的会计表报，就有七十多种。这些汇报把机关累坏了，使它们无法有效率地工作。
    精减机构，这是苏联反对官僚主义中注意的另一点。一九五四年春天，苏联有些政府部门因为精减得慢，受到了批评。赫鲁晓夫同志在苏联最高苏维埃会议上批评了苏联农业部机构的庞大，当时它有四百二十个管理局、处和科，每两个工作人员中就有一个首长。为了使政府的部能对它们的部门和所管辖的企业进行有效的领导，苏联划小了许多部。但是在划分之后，这些新部领导下的各机构的人员不许超过未划分前的原部原有的工作人员的数目。
    反对对下级包办代替，这是苏联反对官僚主义中注意的又一点。每个环节，每个工作人员，对他所作的事情，要负完全责任，要有主动性，这是改进工作作风的重要条件。苏联机关实行的是民主集中制，并不是要把应由下级机关和人员解决的事情集中到上级机关和人员手里。苏联化学工业部有一个管理局局长草拟了一张工作便笺，笺上写明托付他本人和他所管理的工厂应做的事情，呈交部长签署。另外两个管理局的副局长同样草拟了给他们本人的便笺，呈交部长签署。化学部长吉何米罗夫把这些便笺退还草拟人，并且要求他们自己去解决问题，因为这些事情本来应归他们直接负责。部长把这个事实通知了化学工业部的党委员会。因而党委会会议讨论了提高工作人员责任感问题。这样做法，对于克服推诿责任的现象，起了很好作用。
    反对不顾具体条件的公式主义，这是苏联反对官僚主义中注意的又一点。事实证明，不研究地方特点和具体情况而机械地搬用一套原理和办法，会把好事办坏。几年前，苏联集体农庄合并为大集体农庄，这便于更好地使用现代农业技术。但是有些集体农庄之间，被湖沼或森林阻隔着，勉强合并了，反而会增加困难。但是有些工作者明知没有益处，却没有去劝阻它们的合并。苏共中央一九五四年二、三月全会批评了苏联国家计划局、苏联农业部和苏联国营农场部过去到处机械地采用草谷轮种制，使谷物的种地面积和收获量受到影响。根据苏共中央的指示，苏联增种了谷物以代替多年生牧草。最近马尔采夫的新耕作法的提出，为增产谷物开辟了广阔的道路。但是苏联农业工作者现在不搬用马尔采夫耕作法，而细心地研究怎样使马尔采夫耕作法适用于各地具体条件，并且研究采用马尔采夫耕作法时防害虫和施肥等等待解决的问题。
    最近一年来，苏联党和政府采取了许多有效措施来改进党和国家机关的工作作风和方法；如像：实行新的工作日制度，使某些管理部门更接近生产；要求农业科学研究机构和实验站设立在它们所研究的植物生长的地方；要求领导工作者真正到群众中去。
    不要一般的，表面的领导，而要具体的深入的领导，——这就是苏联最近所提倡的工作作风和方法。
    进一步发展农业，从一九五三年苏共中央九月全会提出以来，一直是苏联党和政府的中心任务。从这方面，我们最清楚地看到了工作作风和方法的改进。
    不久以前，苏联各处集体农庄庄员大会都在讨论关于规定有差别的起码的劳动日问题（苏联集体农庄每个庄员每年必须做一定的起码的劳动日的工作）。有些庄员大会认为女庄员的起码劳动日可以定得比男庄员低点。一位党州委会书记认为这违背男女平等的原则，便出来干涉。其实庄员们是为了照顾女庄员，因为看到女庄员在家务上要花费不少时间。这个例子说明，这位党州委书记没有深入到具体生活中去。
    苏联共产党中央一九五三年九月和一九五四年二、三月的全会，曾经一再要求州、区的党和苏维埃工作人员改进领导农业工作的作风和方法。要求区委工作人员透彻了解自己的任务，熟悉农村的生产情况，深入到集体农民中去，了解群众的要求，和他们一道工作。要求州委不要粗枝大叶，不要以宣言和运动来代替对集体农庄的切实帮助，要放弃一般性的领导方法，要铲除表面的领导作风，要深刻地研究情况，要在通晓业务的基础上进行具体领导。
    具体领导，这就是就地对人进行实际的指导：不但告诉人该做什么，还告诉人该怎样做，为什么该这样做，为什么应该在一定期限内完成。近来，苏联党的工作人员比去年更常到下层组织去，在下层组织逗留的时间也更久。例如：苏共莫洛托夫州委员会的党、工会和青年团机关部的十一个指导员，在两个半月中下到各区三十一次，总共逗留了二百五十天。这个州的市委员会和区委员会的工作人员很少坐在办公室里。这个州的州委员会全会讨论了执行苏共中央九月全会和二、三月全会的决定的情形。之后，州委员会书记向州委员会的工作人员详细说明了当前的工作，以具体例子解释了照料作物、准备收割和储藏饲料的任务。会议决定了，州委员会的各部部长和指导员和各区委员会书记要到每个集体农庄去，帮助它们组织这些工作。这样就地组织工作，使得区委员会书记、集体农庄主席和农业技术人员，在州委员会工作人员帮助之下，积累了好经验。
    工作作风和方法的改进，使契卡洛夫州的农业得到很大的发展。
    契卡洛夫州是乌拉尔西南面一个很大的农业州。州的领导机关接到了在一九五四到五五年开垦荒地七十万公顷的任务。全州劳动者支持州的党代表会议的建议，保证开垦荒地一百万公顷。州的农业劳动者并担承了不断提高农作物产量的任务。这些任务要求州里党的、苏维埃的和农业的机关改进对农业的领导，要求集中力量组织工作和动员群众解决农业生产中的问题。它们正是这样做了。
    党州委员会根据党中央全会中关于加强区这个环节的精神，选派了许多有政治修养和组织能力的党员到农业区去，其中不少是党州委员会机关的工作人员。各区的领导工作人员的质量显著地增强了。
    州里以前有不少农业技术人员，他们绝大多数都在机关里写决议，发指示，召开会议，只是没有到生产中去组织工作。在一九五三年苏共中央九月全会以后，农业技术人员下乡去了（下乡去的还有工业技术人员，从别的州也来了大批开荒的青年生力军），党州委员会派人到集体农庄去就地帮助技术人员们。
    党州委员会和区委员会深入到了集体农庄去。在它们帮助下，绝大多数集体农庄挑选了有领导工作经验、熟悉农业的人们当集体农庄主席。挑选以后，还组织了州的集体农庄主席讲习会，以帮助他们交流经验和讨论集体农庄建设的重大问题。党州委员会书记、委员和州苏维埃执行委员会的委员，参加了许多集体农庄庄员大会。和庄员进行了许多谈话。和庄员群众直接来往，使他们容易了解集体农民的情绪和要求，使他们容易纠正自己领导工作和区级机关工作中的缺点。
    一九五四年春天来得晚，气候条件又不好，但是全区大多数机器拖拉机站、集体农庄、国营农场，在八个到十个工作日中完成了谷物的播种，谷物播种面积比去年扩大了三十七万公顷。在春播期间，党州委员会加强了同各区的活的联系：州委员会书记、委员和各部部长和州苏维埃执行委员会委员及其他负责工作人员，都在各个区、拖拉机站和国营农场。他们先到那些最早播种的区。因此，一开头就克服了发生的毛病，并且积累了经验，防止了较晚播种的其他各区产生严重的缺点。
    春播以后，州的领导工作者与各区的活的联系继续着。建立了这样的制度：由党州委员会负责工作人员带领的各工作组，被派出去长期地帮助各区委员会。特别注意帮助那些领导人员比较年青的区委会。州委员会坚决反对把区级工作人员无限制地召来州中心的不良习惯。州委员会要求州级领导机关这样的组织工作，不要从地方召人来，州工作人员自己下到地方去，就地解决问题。
    党州委员会和州苏维埃执行委员会给了落后的农业区以活的实际的帮助，使它们克服了落后现象。加强了这些区的干部和技术装备。派遣了党的、苏维埃的工作者和农业技术人员的工作组去帮助这些区的区委员会和区苏维埃执行委员会。
    全州根据党中央的决定，改组了区级党的机构，在每个机器拖拉机站所服务的地带设立了由一个区委员会书记带领的指导员组。指导员们向集体农庄庄员和拖拉机手联合收割机手等进行工作。指导员们把主要时间放在拖拉机站和集体农庄，依靠党的基层组织，发挥它们的主动性和积极性。
    苏共契卡洛夫州党的领导接近于生产的决定性环节，就是党和苏维埃的工作人员深入到下层和群众中去，实现具体的领导。这样的工作作风和方法，正是苏联向来提倡而今天特别提倡的。
