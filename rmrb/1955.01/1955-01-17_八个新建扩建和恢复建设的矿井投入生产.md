Eight newly built, expanded, and reconstructed mines under the Coal Mine Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the People's Republic of China, namely: Cai Tun Vertical Shaft in Benxi, Liaoning Province, the Western Deep Section of Laohutai in Fushun, Zhongba Inclined Shaft in Yingcheng, Western Horizontal Section of Zha Zi in Tonghua, No. 39 Mine in Jiaozuo, Henan Province, Baidong in Datong, Shanxi Province, Xinjiu Mine in Chengzihe, Jixi, Heilongjiang Province, and Dalu Jiucao No. 1 Inclined Shaft in Hegang, were officially handed over for production in 1954. The annual coal output is equivalent to about twice the current total coal output of the entire Central South region.

Among the eight mines including Cai Tun Vertical Shaft in Benxi, Liaoning Province, the main ones such as Cai Tun Vertical Shaft in Benxi, the Western Deep Section of Laohutai in Fushun, No. 39 Mine in Jiaozuo, and Baidong are mostly designed according to advanced Soviet technology. The Cai Tun Vertical Shaft in Benxi has reached a high degree of mechanization and can produce 1.5 million tons of coal annually. In its huge shaft, five tons of coal can be lifted every minute in the future. Two 1,300-horsepower water pumps can pump more than 13,000 tons of water to the surface in 18 hours. The Western Deep Section of Laohutai in Fushun is also highly mechanized, with an annual output of 1.2 million tons.

The coal produced by these mines is of relatively good quality. In particular, the coal from the Cai Tun Vertical Shaft in Benxi is a rare prime coking coal and lean coal in China, with good bonding properties and low sulfur and phosphorus content. This type of coal can be used to make special steel and can also strengthen the toughness of steel. In the past, the coal production in Benxi was limited and could not fully supply Anshan Iron and Steel Company, so Anshan Iron and Steel had to transport about one million tons of lean coal and fat coal from Fengfeng Coal Mine in Hebei Province every year; after the Cai Tun Vertical Shaft is put into production, Anshan Iron and Steel will be fully supplied with coal. The coal produced by the Western Deep Section of Laohutai in Fushun has low ash content and can be used in combination with prime coking coal.

    八个新建扩建和恢复建设的矿井投入生产
    中华人民共和国燃料工业部煤矿管理总局所属八个新建、扩建和恢复建设的矿井，即：辽宁省本溪彩屯竖井、抚顺老虎台西深部、营城中八斜井、通化砟子西水平、河南焦作三十九号井、山西大同白洞、黑龙江省鸡西城子河新九井、鹤岗大陆九槽一斜，已于一九五四年正式移交生产，全年产煤量，相当于目前中南区全区煤产量的两倍左右。
    辽宁省本溪彩屯竖井等八个矿井中，主要的如本溪彩屯竖井、抚顺老虎台西深部，焦作三十九号井，大都是按照苏联先进技术设计的。本溪彩屯竖井已达到高度的机械化，每年可产煤一百五十万吨，它那巨大的井筒里将来每分钟可以提升五吨煤。两台一千三百匹马力的水泵能够在十八小时内把一万三千余吨水全部排到井上。抚顺老虎台西深部，生产也已高度机械化，年产一百二十万吨。
    这几个矿井生产的煤质量都比较好，特别是本溪彩屯竖井的煤，是我国少有的炼焦用的主焦煤和瘦煤，粘结性很好，含硫、磷率低。这种煤可以用来炼特种钢，还可以加强钢的韧性。过去，本溪煤产量有限，不能充分供应鞍山钢铁公司，所以鞍钢每年要从河北省峰峰煤矿运去约一百万吨瘦煤和肥煤；彩屯竖井投入生产后，鞍钢用煤可以得到充分的供应。抚顺老虎台西深部出产的煤，灰分低，可配合主焦煤使用。
