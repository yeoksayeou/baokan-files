The whole world is watching the intense struggle over how to utilize atomic energy. The forces of peace and progress strive to use the greatest discovery of human wisdom for the benefit of mankind. The forces of war and reaction want to use atomic energy to achieve destructive, imperialist goals, attempting to manipulate the people of other countries.

The Soviet Union, expressing the true wishes of the people of the world, has consistently and unyieldingly fought against the use of atomic energy for war purposes, both in the past and now. Since 1946, Soviet representatives at the United Nations have repeatedly put forward proposals for the prohibition of atomic weapons. This demand has been unanimously supported by the people of all countries. Six hundred million people signed the Stockholm Appeal for the prohibition of atomic weapons.

The Soviet government has repeatedly pointed out that all mankind is concerned with the use of atomic energy solely for peaceful purposes. Although the Soviet Union, in order to protect the peaceful labor and lives of its people, should ensure that it possesses atomic and hydrogen weapons, Soviet scientists and engineers have simultaneously continued to work purposefully and diligently to research the peaceful uses of atomic energy. Their selfless and diligent work has yielded results. On July 1, 1954, the Soviet Union officially announced that the Soviet Union's first industrial atomic power station had begun generating electricity, and this power station has been supplying electricity to nearby industrial and agricultural areas.

In order to promote international cooperation in the peaceful uses of atomic energy, the Soviet government announced on January 14, 1955, that it was prepared to make public the scientific and technical experience accumulated by the Soviet Union. The Soviet government is prepared to submit a report on the Soviet Union's first industrial atomic power station and its operation to the international conference on the peaceful uses of atomic energy, which will be held this year in accordance with the decision of the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly.

The statement of the Soviet Council of Ministers published in yesterday's "Pravda" stated that the Soviet government has decided to provide other countries with scientific, technical, and industrial assistance to establish scientific experimental centers to develop research on nuclear physics and the peaceful uses of atomic energy. The Soviet government has suggested to the People's Republic of China, the Polish People's Republic, the Czechoslovak Republic, the Romanian People's Republic, and the German Democratic Republic that it provide extensive assistance, including the design, supply of equipment, and construction of experimental atomic piles with a thermal capacity of up to 5,000 kilowatts, and atomic particle accelerators. These countries will also be supplied with the necessary amount of atomic piles and fissionable materials for scientific research.

The Soviet Union's scientific, technical, and industrial assistance to these countries in the development of research on the peaceful uses of atomic energy enables these countries to develop large-scale scientific research in nuclear physics, to produce a sufficient number of radioactive isotopes with the help of experimental atomic piles to meet the needs of medicine, biology, and other sciences and engineering, and to train scientists and engineers for the development of research on the peaceful uses of atomic energy. The scientists and engineers of these countries will be able to understand the scientific research work carried out by the Soviet Union in the peaceful use of atomic energy.

The Soviet government is considering expanding the scope of countries it can assist in the scientific research and experimentation for the development of the peaceful uses of atomic energy.

These facts prove that the Soviet Union has consistently and unswervingly strived to make atomic energy serve mankind. The great achievements of the creative labor of scientists, engineers, and technicians have opened a new era in human history. These achievements should be controlled by society and used as a powerful force for progress, to create abundant material wealth and ensure a happy life for all.

The enemies of peace and humanity stand on the completely opposite position. They attempt to use atomic energy to realize their destructive and anti-people conspiracies. The American aggressive bloc has exhausted all its strength to accumulate atomic bombs. They first used atomic bombs as a tool of intimidation and blackmail, as a tool to force other countries to accept its policies. Only after the United States lost its monopoly on atomic weapons, and later hydrogen weapons, did the American propaganda machine lower its tone, because they knew that excessively boasting about the destructive power of these weapons would first panic American residents.

The American atomic bomb advocates have not learned any lessons from their moral failures. They are still waving atomic and hydrogen weapons to this day.

Last December, at the insistence of American warmongers, the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council passed a decision to formulate a European atomic war plan. Upon returning home and reporting this decision, Dulles said: "The current policy is to gradually replace ordinary weapons with atomic weapons." At the beginning of this year, Eisenhower emphasized in his message to Congress that the new military budget would "further emphasize new weapons, especially new weapons with rapid and destructive offensive power," and said that the United States "must continue to improve and expand the production of nuclear weapons for the army, navy, and air force."

These facts show that the American ruling clique not only uses atomic energy for military purposes, but also is formulating specific plans to launch an atomic war. They are spreading provocative rumors about the so-called "Soviet threat," attempting to divert the attention of the American people, especially the people of Western European countries, from the actual dangers posed by adventurous atomic war plans. Under the false banner of "defending Western civilization," they are endangering the life and death of Western European countries, which have smaller territories, dense populations, and concentrated industries, and are also posing serious dangers to the United States.

American government officials often talk about the suitability of using atomic energy for peaceful purposes. In December 1953, when speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, the American president even suggested that relevant countries hand over a portion of their stored normal uranium and fissionable materials to an international atomic energy agency affiliated with the United Nations for use in peaceful purposes.

This suggestion is equivalent to saying that the main portion of atomic materials will still be used to manufacture atomic and hydrogen bombs. Moreover, this suggestion does not in the slightest limit the possibility of using atomic weapons, nor can it impose the slightest restraint on the aggressor's use of atomic weapons at any time and for any purpose. The president's "State of the Union Address" also mentioned the possibility, and even the suitability, of using atomic energy for peaceful purposes. But these words, like the words of other well-known figures in the United States, have not only not been seen in concrete facts, but have not even been seen in concrete suggestions. These words have always been just empty talk.

Everyone should know that there have long been two very clear policies and two paths on how to utilize atomic energy. To permanently rid mankind of the danger of atomic war and to open the road for the extensive use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, this is the Soviet Union's consistent goal. Unlike the American government, which verbally says it wants to use atomic energy for peaceful purposes, while actually preparing for atomic war, the Soviet government is taking concrete and practical measures to promote the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. China's "Wenhui Daily" wrote on January 18: "The Soviet Union has not only established the first atomic power station in human history, but is also prepared to make its experience in this area public. What a great contribution this is to peace and to the welfare of mankind!"

For this reason, the people of the world resolutely oppose the adventurous atomic war plans concocted by American warmongers. The fact that the people of all countries are increasingly opposing this plan and everywhere demanding the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons irrefutably proves this point. The people of the world unanimously support the Soviet Union's noble struggle for the welfare and happiness of mankind: striving to prohibit atomic and hydrogen weapons, and working to master the immense energy of the atom so that it serves peace and progress.

    为了和平和全人类的进步
    ——一月十九日“真理报”社论
    全世界注视着在怎样利用原子能问题上进行的紧张斗争。和平和进步的力量争取使人类智慧的最伟大的发现用来为人类谋福利。战争和反动的势力则想把原子能用来达到毁灭性的、帝国主义的目的，企图来摆布其他国家的人民。
    表达了全世界人民的真正愿望的苏联，无论在过去和现在都是不屈不挠地、贯彻始终地为反对把原子能用于战争目的而斗争。从一九四六年开始，苏联出席联合国代表就一次又一次地提出了关于禁止原子武器的建议。这种要求得到了各国人民的一致支持。曾有六亿人在关于禁止原子武器的斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名。
    苏联政府曾一再指出，全人类关心把原子能只用在和平用途上。虽然苏联为了保护本国人民的和平劳动和生活，应该保证自己拥有原子武器和氢武器，但是苏联的科学家和工程师同时仍然有目的地刻苦努力，研究原子能的和平用途。他们忘我和勤奋的工作取得了成果，一九五四年七月一日苏联正式宣布：苏联第一个原子能工业电力站开始发电，这座电力站已向附近地区的工业和农业供电。
    苏联政府为了促进在原子能和平用途方面的国际合作，在一九五五年一月十四日表示准备把苏联所积累的有关的科学技术经验公开出来。苏联政府准备向根据联合国大会第九届会议决定而在今年召开的和平利用原子能国际会议提出关于苏联第一个原子能工业电力站及其工作情况的报告。
    昨日“真理报”刊载的苏联部长会议的声明说，苏联政府决定给予其他国家以科学、技术和工业上的帮助来建立科学实验中心，以发展对核子物理学和原子能的和平用途方面的研究。苏联政府已向中华人民共和国、波兰人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克共和国、罗马尼亚人民共和国和德意志民主共和国建议提供广泛的帮助，包括设计、供给设备及建设具有达五千瓩热能的实验性原子堆，和原子微粒加速器。还将供给这些国家必要数量的原子堆和科学研究用的可分裂物质。
    苏联在发展原子能和平用途的研究工作方面给予这些国家的科学、技术和工业上的帮助，使这些国家有可能大规模发展核子物理学方面的科学研究工作，借助实验性原子堆生产足够数量的放射性同位素，来满足医学、生物学和其他各门科学和工程学的需要，并为发展原子能和平用途的研究而训练科学家和工程师干部。这些国家的科学家和工程师将有可能了解苏联在和平利用原子能方面所进行的科学研究工作情况。
    苏联政府正在考虑在发展原子能和平用途的科学研究和实验方面扩大它所能够援助的国家的范围的问题。
    这些事实证明，苏联一贯坚持不渝地努力使原子能服务于人类。科学家、工程师和技术人员的创造性劳动的伟大成果在人类历史上打开了一个新纪元，这种成果要由社会加以控制，用来作为向前进步的强大力量，以创造丰足的物质财富，保证一切人都能过幸福的生活。
    和平和人类的敌人站在完全相反的立场，他们企图利用原子能来实现他们的毁灭性的和反人民的阴谋。美国侵略集团使尽了一切力量来积累原子弹，他们首先把原子弹当作恐吓和讹诈的工具，当作强迫别国接受它的政策的工具。只是在美国丧失了对原子武器以及后来的氢武器的垄断之后，美国宣传机器才放低了调子，因为他们知道过分地吹嘘这种武器的破坏能力，首先会使美国居民人心惶惶。
    美国原子弹鼓吹者并没有从他们在道义上的失败中吸取任何教训。他们直到现在还在挥舞着原子武器和氢武器。
    去年十二月里，侵略性北大西洋集团理事会在美国好战分子的坚持下，通过了一项关于制订欧洲原子战争计划的决定。杜勒斯回国后报告这一决定时说：“目前的政策方针是逐步采用原子武器代替通常的武器。”今年一月初，艾森豪威尔在致国会的咨文中着重指出，在新的军事预算中，“更进一步侧重新武器，特别是具有迅速的和毁灭性的攻击力量的新武器”，并且说美国“必须继续改进和扩大陆、海、空军用的核子武器的生产”。
    这些事实表明，美国统治集团不仅把原子能用来为军事目的服务，而且已在制订发动原子战争的具体计划。他们正在散布关于所谓“苏联威胁”的挑拨性的谰言，企图以此来转移美国人民、特别是西欧各国人民的视线，使他们不去注意冒险的原子战争计划所带来的实际危险。他们打着“保卫西方文明”的虚伪招牌，使领土较小、人口稠密、工业集中的西欧国家面临生死存亡的危险，并且使美国也面临严重的危险。
    美国的政府人士常常谈论把原子能用于和平用途是适宜的。一九五三年十二月，美国总统在联合国大会上讲话时，甚至提出过这样的建议：有关国家把它们所储存的一部分正常铀和可分裂物质交给隶属于联合国的国际原子能机构，以便用在和平用途方面。
    这一建议就等于说把主要一部分原子物质仍然用来制造原子弹和氢弹。而且这种建议丝毫没有限制使用原子武器的可能性，也不能对侵略者在任何时候、为了任何目的而使用原子武器加以丝毫的约束。在总统的“国情咨文”中也说到了把原子能用于和平用途的可能性，甚至适宜性。但是这些话，和美国其他一些知名人物所说的话一样，不但没有见之于具体的事实，甚至也没有见之于具体的建议。这些话始终只是一些空话。
    每个人应该知道，在如何利用原子能方面早就十分明确地出现了两种政策，两条道路。永久地使人类摆脱原子战争的危险以及为广泛地利用原子能于和平用途打开道路，这就是苏联一贯的奋斗目标。苏联政府和美国政府不同，美国政府口头上说要使原子能用于和平目的，而实际上却在准备原子战争；苏联政府则在采取具体的实际的措施，来促使原子能用在和平用途上。一月十八日中国的“文汇报”写道：“苏联不仅已经建立起了人类历史上第一座原子发电站，而且准备把这方面的经验公开出来，这是对和平、对人类福祉多么伟大的贡献啊！”
    正因为这样，全世界的人民坚决反对美国好战军人所策划的冒险的原子战争计划。各国人民日益反对这一计划，到处在要求禁止原子武器和氢武器，这些事实无可争辩地证明了这一点。全世界人民一致支持苏联为了人类的福利和幸福而进行的崇高斗争；争取禁止原子武器和氢武器，努力掌握原子的巨大能量使它为和平和进步服务。
