Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, January 5th: The "New Era Newspaper" published the New Year's Letter to the Working People from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Sweden.

The letter points out that the Western aggressive forces are intensifying war preparations. The Swedish government, parliament, the Swedish representative to the United Nations, and all Swedish people should do everything possible to stop the realization of these sinister plans, protect their country from destruction, and support proposals for disarmament, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the establishment of a European collective security system.

The letter states: The Communist Party of Sweden will support all forces within the country that are willing to unite to resist the forces of war, regardless of which political group they belong to.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Sweden calls on Communist and Social Democratic Party organizations to take concerted action on a broad basis in the struggle for the common interests of the working people.
