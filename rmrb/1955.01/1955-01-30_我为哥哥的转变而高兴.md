    I am Happy for my Brother's Transformation
    To the Editor:
    After dinner on January 6th, when I returned to our dormitory, there were several newspapers on the table. I picked up a copy of the People's Daily from January 5th and, as usual, first looked at the headlines on each page. Suddenly, my eyes fell on the headline "Why did Pei Qingyuan Transform?" "Could it be my older brother?" I hoped it was, but I was a little afraid to believe it. I hurriedly read on, and finally, the question was confirmed: Yes, it was my older brother! My heart was jumping with joy...
    My brother's transformation is indeed something to be happy about, because not only was he recently named a "Patriotic Surplus Grain Sales Model" in his township, but according to a recent letter from my sister, my brother has happily joined the Rao Xingli Agricultural Production Cooperative.
    Slowly, the excitement calmed down, and I couldn't help but think of many, many things from the past: In 1948, my hometown had not yet been liberated. That year, as the remnants of the Kuomintang bandit army retreated to the eastern part of Hubei, they were grabbing men everywhere to serve as soldiers and laborers..., which made the people of my hometown, who were already suffering greatly, even more miserable. At that time, adult men always went to the dense forests and gullies of Baishi Mountain to avoid being conscripted, and they couldn't work in the fields at all. Once, the Kuomintang bandit army almost caught all the men to be porters, and my brother was also caught and forced to carry a heavy load of more than 100 catties. The family members were crying and searching everywhere.
    It seemed that the above painful experiences had no impact on my brother. It has been several years since liberation, and everyone is following the road of mutual aid and cooperation, but my brother has not transformed. The dual nature of the middle peasant is very obvious in my brother. My brother is conservative, selfish, and short-sighted. He only sees that his current life is not bad, but he cannot see the long-term benefits. He cannot understand the benefits of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and the unified purchase and sale system in a short period of time. Therefore, his thinking is not clear when he encounters specific problems. Because he often wrote to me to inquire about the Party's policies and complain, I also often tried to persuade and educate him, but it was always difficult to get through to him. Under these specific circumstances, I was impatient and distressed, as if there was no way to deal with him. Today, the backward and selfish brother has finally been educated by vivid facts, which makes me deeply realize what Chairman Mao said: "The serious problem is to educate the peasants," and realize that the Party's policy of developing agricultural mutual aid and cooperation in the countryside is wise and correct.
    I am happy, and I sincerely thank the Party and the people for their warm help, care, and transformation of my family. I must always serve the cause of national defense, work actively, study hard, master military technology skillfully, practice my skills well, and be ready at all times to fight for the liberation of Taiwan and the security of the motherland.

### 我为哥哥的转变而高兴

    我为哥哥的转变而高兴编辑同志：
    一月六日吃罢晚饭，回到我们的宿舍，正好桌上放有几张报纸，顺手拿起一张一月五日的人民日报，习惯地先瞧瞧各版的大标题。猛然，我的视线落在“裴青源为什么会转变”的标题上。“未必是我大哥吗？”很希望是他，但又有点不敢相信。急急匆匆地看下去，问题总算肯定了：是的，就是我大哥！我的心在欢乐地跳动着……。
    哥哥的转变的确值得人高兴，因为他不仅这次被乡里评为“爱国售余粮模范”，而且据最近姐姐来信说，哥哥已愉快地参加了饶兴礼农业生产合作社。
    慢慢的，兴奋的情绪平静下来了，我禁不住想起很多很多的过去的事情：一九四八年，故乡还没有得到解放。这一年，由于国民党的残余匪军溃退到湖北东部一带，到处抓丁、抓夫……，使本来已经遭受着重重苦难的故乡人民，更加处在水深火热之中，当时成年的男人总是去到白石山密树丛林的山沟里逃避抓夫、抓丁，根本不能在田里干活；有一次国民党匪军几乎把所有的男人都抓去当挑夫，我哥也被抓去强迫挑上了一百多斤的重担，家里的人都哭哭啼啼到处找寻。
    以上惨痛的经历，好像对我哥哥没有影响似的，解放好几年了，大家都在走互助合作的道路，可是我哥哥却没有转变；中农的两重性，在我哥哥身上表现得非常明显。我的哥哥保守、自私，眼光短浅，只看到现时生活不坏，看不到长远利益，对互助合作运动、统购统销等，都不能在短时期内体会到它的好处，因而遇到具体问题思想就不通。由于他经常来信向我打听党的政策和诉苦，我也经常地对他进行说服教育，但他的思想总是很难打通。在这种具体情况下，我急躁过、苦恼过，好像对他就没有办法了似的。今天落后自私的哥哥，终于被生动的事实教育了过来，才使我深刻地体会到毛主席说的：“严重的问题是教育农民”，体会到党在农村发展农业互助合作的政策是英明的、正确的。
    我高兴，我衷心地感谢党、感谢人民群众对我家庭热诚的帮助、关怀和改造。我一定要永远为国防事业服务，积极工作，努力学习，熟练地掌握军事技术，练好本领，时刻准备着为解放台湾、保卫祖国的安全而奋斗。
