    Open Fire on Localism
    Production Inspection Department of the East China Office of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry
    In the past two years, the mechanical and electrical industries in Shanghai have carried out production cooperation and mutual support through the following main methods:
    1. Joint Trial Manufacture: One or several factories take the lead in jointly trial-manufacturing a new product or new equipment. For example, the 6,000-kilowatt turbo-generating equipment, including four major products: generator, turbine, 40-ton boiler, and electrical control equipment. No single factory can independently manufacture this complete and complex modern power generation equipment. It has to be manufactured by Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory, Shanghai Turbine Factory, Shanghai Boiler Factory, and Huatong Switch Factory through division of labor. And the products manufactured by these four factories require the cooperation of dozens of factories for processing. Taking the switchboard manufactured by Huatong Switch Factory as an example, 25 factories produce more than 130 kinds of parts for them.
    2. Interlaced Cooperation: This cooperation method is extremely intricate and complex, with closer mutual coordination. For example, the grinding head motor on the Soviet-style 373 surface grinder trial-manufactured by Shanghai Machine Tool Factory requires the cooperation of Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory. The precision requirements of this motor are extremely high, which in turn requires the cooperation of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory for processing. At the same time, the various specifications of wires needed for the 109 types of rotating motors and transformers trial-manufactured by Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory for Shanghai Machine Tool Factory require the cooperation of Shanghai Wire Factory for supply. Many of the 65 new products trial-manufactured by Shanghai Wire Factory are for the new products of Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory and Huatong Switch Factory. If a problem occurs in any factory, it will affect the completion of the trial manufacturing tasks of many factories.
    3. Balancing Equipment: This is to adjust and balance the equipment utilization rate among enterprises, give full play to and utilize production capacity, improve labor productivity, and overcome the weak links existing in enterprises. For example, the crankshaft forging capacity of the factory manufacturing diesel engines in Shanghai is insufficient, which has become a weak link in production. However, the production capacity of various shipbuilding factories with forging workers and equipment is greatly surplus. After adjustment and cooperation, the smooth completion of the diesel engine trial manufacturing task was guaranteed.
    In the process of new product trial manufacture, the importance of production cooperation has already been revealed. Our country's economic system has created extremely favorable conditions for organizing production cooperation. In fact, the cooperative relationship between factories has gradually improved in the past two years. In particular, last December, the factory directors of six electrical appliance factories in Shanghai and East China took the initiative to form a regular meeting among factory directors to discuss relevant new product cooperation once a month, which is a new development in production cooperation relations. However, localism is still the main obstacle to organizing production cooperation. Factories that need cooperation must beg in every possible way and try to accommodate others, while factories that undertake cooperation are picky and domineering. They dislike the cooperated products for being "low in output value," "small in quantity," and "technically complex," or use the excuse of "affecting the national plan" and are unwilling to undertake them, but instead go around soliciting and competing to take on batches of easy-to-do "odd jobs." If they cannot get "odd jobs," they would rather let the equipment in the factory be idle. Some factories only seek cooperation from others but are unwilling to cooperate with others. In the past, the East China Office of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry issued a "Production Cooperation List" to each factory. As a result, some factories filled in extremely detailed information for all projects that required cooperation from others, while for the projects where their own factory had surplus equipment and production capacity to assist others, they did not fill in a single word, or filled in vaguely. Some factories demanded extremely tight deadlines when requiring cooperation from others, but emphasized difficulties and demanded "leniency" when cooperating with others. The poor quality of cooperated products also reflects the seriousness and universality of localism. This shows that the leading cadres of some factories lack an overall concept and are still tainted with capitalist management ideas and the selfishness of small producers.
    In order to improve production cooperation, so as to manufacture more and better industrial products for the country, it is necessary to further strengthen the education of enterprise cadres on the overall concept and open fire on localism! (Attached picture)

    向本位主义开火
    第一机械工业部华东办事处生产检查处
    两年来，上海的机械电器工业各厂通过下述几种主要方式进行生产协作，互相支援。
    一、联合试制：以一个或几个厂为主，联合试制一套新产品、新设备。例如六千瓩汽轮发电设备，包括发电机、汽轮机、四十吨锅炉和电气控制设备四项主要产品，没有一个厂能单独制造这一套完整、复杂的近代化发电设备，不得不由上海电机厂、上海汽轮机厂、上海锅炉厂和华通开关厂分工制造。而这四个厂制造的产品，又需要几十个工厂协作加工。以华通开关厂制造的开关台为例，就有二十五个工厂为他们生产一百三十多种零件。
    二、交错协作：这种协作方式极为错综复杂，相互配合更紧密，例如上海机床厂试制的仿苏式三七三平面磨床上的磨头电动机，需要上海电机厂协作制造，而这种电动机的精密度要求极高，反过来又要求上海机床厂协作加工，同时，上海电机厂为上海机床厂试制的一百零九种旋转电机和变压器中所需要的各种不同规格的电线，又需要上海电线厂协作供应，而上海电线厂试制的六十五种新产品中不少又是为上海电机厂、华通开关厂的新产品而试制的。如果有哪一个厂发生问题，便要影响很多厂的试制任务的完成。
    三、平衡设备：这是为了使各企业间设备利用率得到调整和平衡，充分发挥和利用生产能力，提高劳动生产率，克服企业中存在的薄弱环节。如上海制造柴油机的工厂中曲轴锻造能力不足，成为生产中的薄弱环节，但在有锻工、设备能力的船舶各厂，生产能力却大大有余，经过调整协作，保证了柴油机试制任务的顺利完成。
    在新产品试制过程中，生产协作的重要性已经显露出来了。我们国家的经济制度，给组织生产协作创造了极有利的条件。事实上，两年来工厂之间的协作关系也在逐渐改善着。特别是去年十二月，上海及华东地区的六个电器工厂厂长，主动组成了厂长之间每月一次的讨论有关新产品协作的定期会议，更是生产协作关系的一个新发展。但是，本位主义还是组织生产协作的主要障碍。需要人家协作的厂，必须百般哀求、委曲求全，而承接协作的厂，则百般挑剔、盛气凌人。他们嫌人家协作品“产值低”、“数量少”、“技术复杂”，或借口“影响国家计划”而不愿承接，却四出兜揽、互相争接成批的、容易做的“杂活”，揽不到“杂活”，宁愿让厂里的设备闲置起来。有一些厂只求人家协作而不愿为人家协作。过去，第一机械工业部华东办事处曾给各厂发下一份“生产协作一览表”，结果，有的厂对凡是要求人家协作的项目都填得极为详细，而对本厂有哪些多余设备和生产能力可协助人家的项目则只字不填，或填得含含糊糊。还有一些厂要求人家协作时限时限刻，为人家协作时则强调困难，要求“放宽尺度”。协作品的质量都不够好，也反映了本位主义的严重和普遍。这说明了一些厂的领导干部缺乏整体观念，脑子里还沾染着资本主义的经营思想和小生产者的自私观念。
    为了改进生产协作，以便给国家制造更多更好的工业产品，必须进一步加强对企业干部进行整体观念的教育，向本位主义开火！（附图片）
