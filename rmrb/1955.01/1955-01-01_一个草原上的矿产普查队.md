    A Mineral Survey Team on the Prairie
    Fan Rongkang
    Comrades who returned to Beijing from the 126 Prospecting Team told me the following story.
    To Chonggen Aola
    In the summer of last year, when the national mineral prospecting work began on a large scale, a prospecting team—Team 126—was sent to Chonggen Aola (Mountain) on the Inner Mongolia prairie.
    This was a newly formed prospecting team. Most of the geological personnel were specialist students who had just graduated from the Northeast Institute of Geology last summer. Most of the prospecting team members were also going to the Inner Mongolia prairie for the first time. They crossed the Greater Khingan Mountains and traveled hundreds of kilometers through the sparsely populated grasslands of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, arriving at a salt lake. There, they began surveying the salt lake while preparing to enter Chonggen Aola.
    Team leader Lin Yingdai led a group of people on horseback to scout out the situation at Chonggen Aola. They brought back exciting news: the rocks all over Chonggen Aola were excellent clues for finding several important minerals.
    On the night this good news arrived, the prospecting team members couldn't sleep for a long time. Along the way, during the hundreds of kilometers of travel through the grasslands, the Mongolian people warmly treated them with milk tea and milk curd, and offered them their own tents to stay in. Someone told them that there was an "Iron Cabinet Mountain" on the prairie, and buried in the mountain was a huge iron cabinet. For many years, the Mongolian people had tried to open the door of this iron cabinet, but had never been able to do so. Someone told them: There is a huge magnetite mine on the prairie where farmers, when hoeing the ground, would find their hoes stuck and impossible to pull out; blacksmiths passing by with their loads would find their burdens stuck and impossible to lift. Still others told them: there is a Pearl Mountain on the prairie, covered with sparkling pearls that shine day and night... Behind these moving rumors, there seemed to be millions of simple and sincere eyes earnestly watching them, yearning for something. This intense gaze moved the prospecting team members deeply and made them feel uneasy. What would they take to answer this yearning? Now that good clues had been discovered and the prospecting team was about to enter Chonggen Aola, a great joy filled their hearts.
    A Difficult Journey
    However, no one expected that entering Chonggen Aola would involve so many difficulties.
    The prospecting team's logistics unit had fallen far behind and there was no news. At that time, the prospecting team had only two tents and three iron hammers for driving nails. After the large-scale prospecting work began, there were not enough workers, and there was no transportation. More seriously, there was the problem of water.
    Was there water in Chonggen Aola? No one dared to answer this question with certainty. Several Mongolians familiar with the local conditions were asked, and they said, "It's hard to say! Very few people travel this road." Then, they gave well-meaning advice: "On the prairie, water is life, be sure to camp in places with water."
    Team 126 sent people to the local league government to request support, and also sent several comrades familiar with hydrogeology to a place called Xiaobaliang to dig a well. If water could be drawn from Xiaobaliang, the main force could advance to Xiaobaliang, which was relatively close to Chonggen Aola.
    A few days later, news came that the well in Xiaobaliang had been dug several meters deep, and the soil was still moist, so there might be water. The main force ended its work at the salt lake and eagerly transferred to Xiaobaliang.
    On this day, all available water containers were filled with water. The sky was cloudless, and the fiery red sun hung over the prairie. The air was scorching hot. People were thirsty, and horses were thirsty, but water was precious and they dared not drink too much. Everyone just quickened their pace and hurried forward.
    When they arrived at Xiaobaliang, they discovered the most unfortunate thing: the well had been dug very deep, but the soil was getting drier and drier, so dry that it could no longer be dug. Obviously, there would be no water.
    The tired troops were stranded in Xiaobaliang. The team headquarters realized that the situation was very serious. Of course, it could not yet be called a dead end. They could still return to the salt lake, where there was water. But no one wanted to go back. They did not come to the Inner Mongolia prairie to drink water; they came to Chonggen Aola to find minerals.
    Deputy Team Leader Tong Ziyu carefully examined the map and discovered that there was a well in another direction of Chonggen Aola, in a place called Dajing (Big Well). The team headquarters decided to turn back and advance towards Dajing, hoping to establish a base for climbing the mountain at Dajing.
    The next day, the transportation delayed them. On the third day, Team 126 again traveled in the hot prairie until dark, and camped on a hillside. That night, the last drop of water was drunk. They were trapped in a most terrible situation.
    Early on the fourth day, the main force continued to advance. They knew that there was no other hope now. The only way out was to move forward, to reach Dajing sooner so they could drink water sooner, free themselves from their predicament sooner, and start working sooner.
    A whole morning passed. Prairie followed prairie, and sun followed sun. They found no well, no drop of water. People's lips were dry and cracked, their mouths were full of sticky white foam, and their heads began to feel dizzy. It was extremely difficult to sit down to rest and then stand up again.
    Everyone insisted on moving forward without complaint. Soon, they finally discovered some yurts. Where there are people living, there must be water, which strengthened their confidence. As they approached, they found a small lake, which the locals called a "nitrate pond." A stench spewed out of the water. When the water was drawn up, it was yellow and smelled bad. Although the water stank, it was equally precious to the people who had not drunk a drop in this arid prairie. Everyone drank the water, ate their meal, and continued to move forward. In the evening, they finally arrived at Dajing, and indeed found a well. The well was well-built, the clear water was still, and the surroundings of the well bottom were still iced over. The people by the well shouted happily:
    "Comrades, drink water! Ice-cold water."
    People who had been troubled by thirst for a long time drank heartily enough, as if they had never drunk such good water. Some even took off their clothes and took a bath, and some opened their clothes to let the light evening breeze caress their chests. The hardships and difficulties of many days seemed to have become things of the distant past at this moment.
    Two tents were erected at Dajing. The prospecting team members gazed greedily at Chonggen Aola. Chonggen Aola was close at hand. Larks and skylarks flew in the sky. Chonggen Aola was draped in a light mist, and behind that mist, under the floating soil, lay the treasures needed for national construction.
      Difficulties
    Although Chonggen Aola was close at hand, the journey was still a long way off. On the first day of work, they set off early in the morning and didn't reach Chonggen Aola until nearly noon. Everyone was greedy to do some work, and when they returned to the team it was already dusk, and the prairie was vast and boundless. The prospecting team lost its way. Fortunately, the comrades who stayed at home erected a bamboo pole on the tent, allowing the prospecting team to find its way home.
    In the evening, summarizing the work of this first day, the team leaders felt heavy-hearted. The first problem was that the journey was long, and too much time was spent traveling back and forth, so there was too little actual working time. The second problem was that the water they could carry was far from enough to compensate for the consumption of traveling sixty miles back and forth and working up and down the mountains. The team headquarters decided to find a water source in Chonggen Aola, move into Chonggen Aola, eliminate the long trek of sixty miles back and forth every day, and completely solve the water problem.
    The next day, the prospecting team members were divided into three groups, and dissected Chonggen Aola along three observation routes. Two deputy team leaders took several workers to dig wells in Chonggen Aola. They searched for a long time before finding a relatively suitable location. The terrain here was relatively low, the pasture was fertile, and mountain butterflies lay on the grass greedily sucking the moisture from the soil. It was estimated that water could be dug out. But later, the soil became drier and drier, and there was no hope at all.
    The comrades who were running the observation routes quickly drank all the water they brought. At lunchtime, there was no water, and the dry rations could not be swallowed. Thirst quickly consumed people's energy. People were tired, their legs were weak, and their mouths were parched. Looking up at the blue sky, if there was a sign of rain in the sky, it would be good to let the rainwater moisten the parched lips! But there was not a single dark cloud in the high sky, and the sun was heating the land.
    In the evening, when they returned to Dajing, everyone was exhausted. Everyone desperately drank water. Some people vomited as soon as they drank it, and their bodies were weak and powerless, as if they had suffered a serious illness.
    The prospecting team was difficult to advance. The farther they went, the longer the round trip, and the threat of water would be more serious. The already too little actual working time would be even less. The prospecting work in Chonggen Aola was thus forced to be postponed. The prospecting team arranged new work, asking everyone to sort out the specimens, and arrange for everyone to dig wells and pan for sand in the place with the most scree. The prospecting team members accepted the new work, but their hearts were always restless. They were constantly yearning to go back to Chonggen Aola.
    One day, the cow dung in the kitchen ran out. Without fuel, they couldn't even eat. The team headquarters arranged for everyone to pick up cow dung, and the prospecting team members set off with basins, tarpaulins, and raincoats. Although the team leaders had made a mobilization to pick up cow dung early on, some people inevitably complained, "What is this for? Picking up cow dung with a field allowance, how can we be worthy of the country!"
    The team leaders' mood was equally heavy, but they believed that the comrades who went to the league government for help would not return empty-handed. As long as they could borrow a large truck, they could reduce the time spent on the road and solve the water problem.
      Seeking Assistance
    There were three prospecting team members who went to the league government for assistance, leaving in two batches.
    Genzhu, an assistant technician from the Inner Mongolia Geological Bureau, set off on horseback with Wang Tianyou, a graduate of the Northeast Institute of Geology. They traveled for three days, climbing over mountains, walking through prairies, and crossing a sixty-mile-long desert area. On the fourth day, the dry rations were exhausted and the water was drunk up. Two tired people rode on two tired horses, especially Wang Tianyou, who was new to riding and had a weak constitution, had reached the point where he could not support himself.
    Hunger and thirst made their heads feel heavy and their feet feel light, and their hearts felt empty. But they kept in mind the expectations of the whole team, and did not dare to stop. At four o'clock in the afternoon, they were met by a ox cart, with a middle-aged Mongolian couple sitting on the cart. Genzhu went up to chat with them, and the Mongolian man pulled out a box from the cart and said, "You are all good-hearted people. This is a box of cakes, just bought from the Obu Conference, to send to my brother for his wedding. Eat some!"
    They ate some cake and continued on their way. This little bit of cake gave them new strength. It made them feel that although it was a vast prairie with few people, they were not alone, and everyone was supporting them.
    They didn't know how long they had been walking. It was already dark when they finally saw a bright light in the distance. They knew they had reached the league government.
    The league leader listened to the report of the prospecting team members who came to ask for help, and knew that the prospecting team was in the greatest difficulty. He said, "Good! You've come. We will fully support your work. A power plant is being built here, and the league government is treating this as an important task. However, the power plant will only be a power plant, but your work can lead to many, many factories, fundamentally changing the face of this prairie. If you need workers, we will transfer workers from the power plant to support you."
    With the enthusiastic help of the league government, the problems that Team 126 needed to solve were solved one by one. Workers were available, tools were purchased as much as possible, the league leader mobilized the lamas who participated in the Obu Conference to vacate their tents to supply the prospecting team, and the league government gave one of the only two trucks to the prospecting team. With a truck, the prospecting team could live in any place with water farther from Chonggen Aola.
    All the problems were solved, but the league leader was not at ease. He was always worried that there was something that these people who came to the prairie for the first time had overlooked, so he went to Chonggen Aola with everyone.
      Reporting Good News
    On this day, the prospecting team members heard a burst of motor sounds coming from a distance in the tent. Everyone walked out of the tent and saw a large truck speeding over and stopping. Genzhu, Wang Tianyou, the league leader, and the workers who came to support them jumped out of the truck...
    Everyone cheered. Now that they had the league government and the support of fraternal nationalities, there was no longer any difficulty that could stop them from moving forward. The next day, the large truck transported the prospecting team members to Chonggen Aola, and the prospecting work in Chonggen Aola developed rapidly.
    Soon, the information they had could lead to the conclusion that the minerals that the country asked them to find had been found in Chonggen Aola.
    In August of last year, Zhao Yinzhen, deputy team leader of Team 126, first went to the league government and then to Beijing to report on his work to the Ministry of Geology.
    At the league government, the league leader warmly received him and listened to his exciting report. He repeatedly urged him, "When you arrive in Beijing, please tell the Ministry of Geology that we hope that the Ministry of Geology will continue to send people here next year. We will do our best to help solve the difficulties in work and life." Then, he said excitedly, "We have all thought about it. You want to eat green vegetables; there is a wetland on the Chonggen Aola side that can be used to open a vegetable garden. If you want to drink milk, we can mobilize some people to move the yurts near Chonggen Aola and send you milk every morning. Your kitchen won't raise sheep, and the sheep are thin. Don't raise them in the future, and we will have people send them to you. If you need workers, we can also find them for you, and winter fur clothes are not a problem."
    In Beijing, on an early summer and early autumn morning, the sun shone through the low-hanging curtains into a rectangular office of the Ministry of Geology. The desk was surrounded by people, including Soviet expert Kusochkin, Xie Jiarong, chief engineer of the Geological Mineral Resources Department of the Ministry of Geology, and Zhao Yinzhen, deputy team leader of Team 126. They repeatedly looked at the samples of minerals in two paper boxes, which Zhao Yinzhen brought back from Chonggen Aola.
    This office in Beijing was thousands of miles away from the tents erected in Chonggen Aola. Thousands of miles away, on the prairie far away from Beijing, the hard work of this group of geological workers who had just left school received the highest reward - it attracted great attention from the Ministry of Geology. Immediately, Huang Jiqing, executive member of the Prospecting Committee of the Ministry of Geology, Huang Yi, chief engineer of the Northeast Geological Bureau, and Soviet expert Vakhrushev all rushed to Team 126.
    The face of Team 126 changed rapidly. It is now a strong prospecting team with hundreds of people. Prospecting work is no longer only carried out in Chonggen Aola; in Baiyin Aola, in Hege Aola, in Chaoge Wudeer, in many places where names cannot be found on the map, prospecting team members have appeared. During these boiling days, a large number of people and materials were transferred from the Ministry of Geology, from the Northeast Geological Bureau, and from the league government. Batches of workers came to the prairie, groups of surveyors were transferred, and a large number of pit exploration timber was transported from Zhangjiakou. A laboratory was also established. The Ministry of Geology also allocated three large trucks. The league government guaranteed that the whole team could eat fine grain. Under the earnest care of the deputy secretary of the League Committee of the Communist Party of China, the fur coats for last year were first supplied to the needs of the prospecting team.
    Winter has come to the prairie, and according to the original plan, it is time for the prospecting team to withdraw and leave. But the prospecting team decided to spend the winter on the prairie. They want to overcome all difficulties, seize the time, and mobilize the minerals of the Inner Mongolia prairie to join the ranks of national economic construction as soon as possible.

    一个草原上的矿产普查队
    范荣康
    从一二六普查队回到北京来的同志，告诉我下面这个故事。
    到崇根敖拉去
    去年夏季，全国规模的矿产普查工作开始时，有一个普查队——一二六队，被派到内蒙古草原上的崇根敖拉（山）去。
    这是一支新组成的普查队，全队大多数地质人员都是东北地质学院去年夏季刚毕业的专科学生；大多数普查队员也是第一次到内蒙古草原去，他们翻过大兴安岭，穿过内蒙古自治区数百公里人烟稀少的草原，来到一个盐湖旁边，一面展开盐湖的普查工作，一面准备进入崇根敖拉。
    队长林英岱带人骑马到崇根敖拉去侦察情况。他们带回一个振奋人心的消息：崇根敖拉遍地的岩石，都是寻找几种重要矿产的良好的线索。
    在这喜讯传来的夜晚，普查队员们久久不能入眠。这一路上，数百公里草原地带的旅途中，蒙古人民热情地用奶子茶、奶豆腐款待他们，把自己的帐篷让给他们住。有人告诉他们，在草原上有一座铁柜山，山里埋藏着一只巨大的铁柜，多少年来，蒙古人民努力去打开这只铁柜的大门，但始终没有能打开。有人告诉他们：在草原上有一个巨大的磁铁矿，农民在那里锄地，锄头挖下去，就给粘在地里拔不出来；焊锅的匠人从那里经过，挑的担子也给粘住了，再也挑不起来。还有人告诉他们：在草原上有一座珍珠山，满山都是亮晶晶的珍珠，日夜闪光……在这些动人的传闻的后面，仿佛有千万双淳厚的眼睛诚恳地注视着他们，渴求着什么，这种凝神注视的眼光使普查队员们深受感动而又心怀不安，他们将拿什么去回答这种渴望呢？现在，良好的线索发现了，普查队马上就要开进崇根敖拉，一种巨大的喜悦布满在他们心头。
    艰难的路程
    但是，谁也没有想到，开进崇根敖拉还有重重困难。
    普查队的辎重部队一直落在后面，毫无音信。当时普查队所有的只是两顶帐篷，三把敲钉子的铁锤，大面积的普查工作开始后，工人不够，交通工具也没有，而更严重的问题是水。
    崇根敖拉有水吗？这个问题没有一个人敢作肯定的回答。询问了几个熟悉当地情况的蒙古人，他们说：“说不清呵！这条路很少有人走。”接着，就是善意地叮嘱：“草原上，水是命，千万宿在有水的地方。”
    一二六队派了人到当地的盟政府去请求支援，又派了几个熟悉水文地质的同志到一个叫小坝梁的地方去打井，如果小坝梁能打出水来，大队就可以前进到小坝梁。从那里到崇根敖拉已经比较近了。
    几天后，消息传来，小坝梁的井已经挖了几公尺深，土还是湿的，可能有水。大队人马结束了盐湖的工作，迫不及待地向小坝梁转移了。
    这一天，所有可以盛水的器具都盛满了水。万里无云，火红的太阳挂在草原的上空。空气热得灼人。走在路上，人也渴，马也渴，但水是宝贵的，不敢多喝。大家只是加快脚步，朝前赶路。
    走到小坝梁，他们发现了最不幸的事情：井已经挖得很深了，但土越来越干，干得再也挖不动了。显然，水是不会有的了。
    疲倦的人马困在小坝梁。队部发现情况是非常严重的。自然，还不能说是绝路。他们还可以回到盐湖去，盐湖有水。但谁也不愿意回去。他们不是到内蒙古草原来喝水的，他们要到崇根敖拉去找矿。
    副队长仝子鱼仔细地察看地图，发现崇根敖拉的另一个方向有一个叫大井的地方有一口井。队部决定折回去，向大井前进，希望能在大井建立上山的根据地。
  第二天，交通工具把他们耽误了。第三天，一二六队又在炎热的草原上走到天黑，宿在一个山坡上。这一晚，最后一滴水喝完了。他们陷入一个最可怕的遭遇里。
    第四天一早，大队人马继续前进。他们知道，现在再也没有别的指望了，唯一的出路就是前进，早一点到达大井，就能早一点喝到水，早一点从困境中解脱出来，早一点开始工作。
    整整一个上午过去了。草原接着草原，太阳连着太阳。他们没有发现一口井，一滴水。人们的嘴唇干燥得龟裂了，嘴里尽是黏黏的白沫，头也开始昏了，坐下去休息，重新站起来万分困难。
    所有的人都毫无怨言地坚持前进，不久，终于发现一些蒙古包，有人住的地方必有水，这给他们增强了信心。走近去，果然发现一个小湖，当地人称它为硝泡子。一阵阵的恶臭从水面上喷出来。水打上来一看，发黄，有臭味。虽然水发着恶臭，但在这干涸的草原上，对这群点水未进的人们说来，同样是宝贵的。大家喝完水，吃了饭，又继续前进。傍晚，终于到了大井，果然发现了一口井。井垒得很好，清清的水一动也不动，井底的四周还结着冰。井旁的人高兴地喊起来：
    “同志们，喝水呵！冰镇凉水”。
    久被口渴困恼的人痛痛快快地喝了个够，仿佛从来没有喝过这样好的水。有的还脱了衣服，洗起澡来，有的敞开衣襟让傍晚的轻风拂着胸膛。多少天来的艰苦困难，在这一刻，好像已变成过去已久的事情。
    两顶帐篷在大井架起来。普查队员们贪婪地望着崇根敖拉。崇根敖拉近在眼前了，百灵鸟和云雀在天空飞翔，崇根敖拉披着轻淡的暮雾，在那暮雾的后面，在那浮土底下，埋藏着国家建设所需要的宝藏。
      困难
    崇根敖拉虽然近在眼前，走起来却还有遥远的路程。开始工作的第一天，从早晨出发、走到快十二点，才到了崇根敖拉。大家贪做了点工作，回队时已是暮色沉沉，草原茫茫无际，普查队迷失了方向，所好留在家里的同志在帐篷上竖立了一根竹杆，让普查队找到归途。
    晚上，总结这第一天的工作，队长们都感到心境沉重，第一个问题是路途遥远，往返跋涉的时间太多，实际工作的时间太少，第二个问题是他们所能携带的水，远远不能抵偿六十里路往返和翻山越岭工作的消耗。队部决定，要设法在崇根敖拉找到水源，搬进崇根敖拉去，免除每天往返六十里的长途跋涉，彻底解决水的困难。
    第二天，普查队员们分成三组，沿着三条观测路线解剖崇根敖拉。两个副队长带了几个工人在崇根敖拉挖井。他们找了很久，才找到一个比较合适的地点。这里地势比较低，牧草肥沃，山蝴蝶伏在草上贪婪地吸着土地的湿气，估计可能挖出水来。但挖到后来，土越来越干，一点希望也没有了。
    跑观测路线的同志很快就喝完了带来的水。午饭的时候，没有水，干粮咽不下去。口渴迅速消耗着人们的精力。人累了，腿软了，嘴焦了。抬头望青天，天上若有雨意，让雨水润一润干涸的嘴唇也好呵！但高高的天上没有一片乌云，太阳晒得土地发热。
    晚上，回到大井，一个个都精疲力尽。大家拚命喝水，有人刚喝下去，就呕吐出来，混身软弱无力，好像害了一场大病。
    普查队是难以前进的了。越往前走，往返的路程越长，水的威胁将更严重，已经太少的实际工作时间将会更少。崇根敖拉的普查工作就这样被迫推迟了。普查队布置了新的工作，要大家整理标本，布置大家在转石最多的地方挖井、淘沙。普查队员们接受了新的工作，心里却总是烦躁不安，他们无时不在渴望着重上崇根敖拉。
    有一天，伙房里的牛粪烧完了。没有燃料，连饭都吃不上。队部布置大家去捡牛粪，普查队员们拿着脸盆，油布和雨衣出发了。虽说队长们早作了捡牛粪的动员，但仍不免有人牢骚满腹，“这是干吗呢？拿了野外津贴捡牛粪，怎么对得起国家呵！”
    队长们的心情也一样沉重，只是他们相信，到盟政府去求援的同志不会空手回来。只要能借回一辆大卡车，就可以减少耗费在路上的时间，就可以解决水的困难。
      求援
    去到盟政府求援的普查队员共有三个人，分两批启程。
    内蒙古地质处助理技术员根柱是和东北地质学院毕业生王天友一起骑马出发的。他们走了三天，翻过一座座山岭，走过一片片草原，穿过六十里长的沙漠地带。第四天，干粮吃完了，水喝完了。两个疲倦的人骑在两匹疲倦的马上，特别是王天友初学骑马，体质又弱，已到了支持不住的地步。
    饥和渴使他们头重脚轻，心里空荡荡的。但他们牢记着全队的期望，不敢停留。下午四时，迎面来了一辆牛车，一对中年蒙古夫妇坐在车上。根柱迎上去和他们攀谈起来，那蒙古男子从车上翻出一个盒子来说：“你们都是心好的人，这是一盒饼，刚从鄂博大会上买来，送我弟弟办喜事的，你们吃一点吧！”
    他们吃了一点饼，又继续前进。这一点饼给了他们新的力量。使他们感到虽然是茫茫草原，人烟稀少，但他们不是孤独的，人人都在支持他们。
    又不知走了多少时间，天已大黑，最后才看到远处一片灯火辉煌，他们知道：到盟政府了。
    盟长听了前来求援的普查队队员们的汇报，知道普查队陷入最大的困难中。他说：“好啊！你们来了，我们要全力支持你们的工作。这里正在建设一个发电厂，盟政府是把这当作一项重要工作去做的。可是，发电厂建成了，只是一个发电厂，你们的工作却可以引出许多许多工厂来，根本改变这个草原的面貌。你们要工人，我们从发电厂调工人支援你们。”
    在盟政府的热诚帮助下，一二六队所需要解决的问题逐一解决了。工人有了，工具尽了最大的可能添置了，盟长动员了参加鄂博大会的喇嘛们腾出帐篷来供给普查队，盟政府把仅有的两辆卡车让出了一辆给普查队。有了卡车，普查队就可以住在距崇根敖拉较远的任何一个有水的地方。
    所有的问题都解决了，可是盟长不放心，他总耽忧这批初次来到草原上的人们还有什么事情疏忽过去，就随大家一同到崇根敖拉去。
      报捷
    这一天，普查队员们在帐篷里听见远处有一阵阵马达声传来，大家走出帐篷看见一辆大卡车驰过来，停住了。车上跳下根柱、王天友、盟长和来支援他们的工人……
    大家欢呼起来，现在有了盟政府，有了兄弟民族的支援，再也没有什么困难能阻挡他们前进了。第二天，大卡车就把普查队员们送到崇根敖拉，崇根敖拉的普查工作迅速开展了。
    不久，他们占有的资料已可以下这样的结论：国家要求他们寻找的矿产已在崇根敖拉找到了。
    去年八月里，一二六队副队长赵寅震先到盟政府，后到北京向地质部汇报工作。
    在盟政府，盟长热情地接待了他，听了他的令人兴奋的报告，一再叮嘱他：“到了北京，请你转告地质部，我们希望地质部明年继续派人到这里来，工作上，生活上的困难，我们将尽一切力量帮助解决。”接着，他兴奋地说：“我们都想好了。你们要吃青菜；在崇根敖拉那边有一块湿地，可以辟一个菜园。你们要想喝奶，我们可以动员一些人把蒙古包搬到崇根敖拉附近，每天早上给你们送奶。你们伙房不会养羊，羊都瘦了，以后就别养了，我们让人给你们送。你们需要工人，我们也可以替你们找到，过冬的皮衣服更不成问题。”
    在北京，一个夏末秋初的早晨，阳光透过低垂的帘子，照进地质部一间长方形的办公室。办公桌前围满了人，其中有苏联专家库索奇金，有地质部地质矿产司总工程师谢家荣，有一二六队副队长赵寅震，他们反复看着盛在两只纸盒里的矿石的标本，这些标本是赵寅震从崇根敖拉带回来的。
    北京城中的这间办公室，和架在崇根敖拉的帐篷相距数千里。在数千里外，在那远离北京的草原上，这一批初出学校的地质工作者的辛勤劳动得到最高的奖赏——它引起地质部极大的注意。立刻，地质部普查委员会常务委员黄汲清，东北地质局主任工程师黄懿和苏联专家瓦赫卢谢夫等都赶到一二六队去。
    一二六队的面貌迅速改变了，它现在已是一支拥有数百人的强大的普查队。普查工作已不只在崇根敖拉进行；在白音敖拉，在赫格敖拉，在朝格乌得尔，在许多地图上找不出名称的地方，都出现了普查队的队员。在这些沸腾的日子里，从地质部，从东北地质局，从盟政府，调来大批的人和物资，一批批的工人来到草原上，一组一组的测量人员调来了，大批坑探用的木料，从张家口运进来，化验室也成立了。地质部还拨来了三辆大卡车。盟政府保证全队可以吃上细粮，在中共盟委副书记的殷切关怀下，去年的皮衣首先供应了普查队的需要。
    冬天来到了草原，按照原先的计划，已经到了普查队快要撤队离去的时候了。但普查队决定在草原上过冬，他们要战胜一切困难，抓紧时间，及早动员内蒙古草原的矿产参加到国家经济建设的行列中来。（附图片）
