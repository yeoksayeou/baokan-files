    A Successful Labor Discipline Education
    Working Group of the Propaganda Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    The Qiqihar Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Factory conducted a relatively concentrated labor discipline education for all its employees last winter, which achieved great results.
    Their approach was as follows: First, through the Party members, Youth League members, and propagandists in each workshop, they conducted a survey and analysis of the labor discipline compliance of the more than 4,100 employees in their 15 workshops. The survey results showed that 50 percent of the employees consistently adhered to labor discipline, strictly adhered to their work posts, ensured eight hours of work per day, obeyed leadership assignments, united and helped each other, cherished state property, and were able to model production tasks. For example, worker Zhao Zhongwen of the freight car workshop had been transferred seven times in the past two years due to work needs, and he never bargained, always obeying leadership assignments. In production, he cherished every minute of time and persisted in not being absent from work for three years and eleven months. He was also very enthusiastic about helping others. Once, when there were not enough boots available for work, he gave his own boots to others, and his cotton trousers were half wet, but he did not complain and continued to work tensely and happily. The workers were moved and said, "We won't feel tired even if we work with you for a lifetime." There are many more such examples. Nearly 40 percent of the employees were able to comply with labor discipline, but they valued personal interests more, sometimes haggling over work posts, and could not launch struggles against those who violated labor discipline. Another 10 percent of the people were indifferent to production, consistently failed to comply with labor discipline, and had serious illegal and undisciplined behaviors. The vast majority of these people were young workers, and their specific manifestations were:
    1.  They cannot guarantee eight hours of work per day and are often late and leave early. They make noise during production time, their work is not intense, they waste time arbitrarily, they do not start work on time, and they go to the cafeteria to eat before the end of the shift. They sleep and doze off during the night shift production. They are often absent from work without reason. Qinggong Luo Yunge and Zhang Hongde from the freight car workshop played with paper turtles during production time. Su Baolin averaged only three hours of work per day, wandering around everywhere. When others asked him why he was doing this, he said, "Our freight car workshop has a large family and many people, and wandering around once in a while doesn't matter." Li Xuexin, a worker in the parts workshop, often took time off. In June of last year, he only worked for one day and was an hour late. Qinggong Chen Yuhe from the mechanical workshop, when working on the "side frame," because he was tired and didn't earn much money, went home to rest, causing the machine to stop for eight hours, seriously affecting production.
    2.  They despise product quality, work carelessly, do not comply with process regulations and safety regulations, and constantly cause mechanical accidents and personal accidents. For example, Li Zegen from the parts workshop did not comply with operating procedures, simply pursued quantity, and produced forty-four defective products in one month. When the workshop cadres educated him, he did not humbly accept it, but instead put forward three requirements: transfer to another workshop; change his position; and never implement piecework wages. Chen Zhiyun, a worker in the boiler workshop, was careless in his work, and his arm was broken by a belt. Qinggong Cui Xianrong from the freight car workshop left his machine to go to the administrative office to discuss Peking opera with female staff members. The machine was unattended, and the gear was damaged.
    3.  They do not obey leadership assignments and are passive and sluggish in their work. All 20-plus workers in the gas group of the material workshop are not at ease in their work, doing less than two hours of work a day, scolding the leaders, not obeying assignments, and performing "cross talk" during production time. Qi Liansheng, a worker in the group, did nothing one day except make a kitchen knife for himself. Huang Kai, a crane operator in the steel casting workshop, took sick leave all day long and said, "I don't make big mistakes, but I keep making small mistakes. Let's see what the leadership does."
    4.  A very small number of employees also engage in corruption, theft, gambling, speculation, and other serious illegal and undisciplined behaviors. Cui Ronghe, a worker in the locomotive workshop, went to the market to sell watches and steal money and was arrested by the Public Security Bureau. Zhou Yude from the freight car workshop played cards at home at night. In the morning, his wife called him to get up for work, but he not only did not listen but also beat her. Qinggong in the transportation workshop overstated piecework hours and embezzled piecework wages. Qinggong Ding Xizhong from the cold wheel workshop took the excuse of going home and embezzled more than 300,000 yuan in fare-free ticket expenses. Qinggong Cao Yongchang and others from the forging workshop even frequently chased women on the streets. Although these non-working class behaviors are caused by a few people, they have a very bad influence.
    Why do these few employees fail to comply with labor discipline? The main reasons are:
    1.  Since 1952, the number of new workers has increased significantly. They come from various other classes and have different backgrounds. Some have just graduated from school, and some have just put down their farm tools. Their motives for entering the factory are also different. Therefore, after entering the factory, they brought some small-proprietor thoughts and styles that are incompatible with collective discipline: freedom and looseness, inability to get used to collective life, and serious economic tendencies. In production, they do not obey leadership, bargain for work, and make trouble about wages. Some people openly say: "We rush to do piecework, we loaf around doing timekeeping work, and we work slowly enough to get by." "We do work that earns a lot of money, we don't do work that earns less money, we do light work, we don't do hard work, we do what we like, and we don't do what we don't like."
    2.  Individual employees are influenced by bourgeois ideology, are not at ease in production, and always think about going to work in private factories. For example, worker Ma Guangyi was wooed by capitalists, always complained about earning less money, made trouble, and wanted to jump ship. In production, he not only failed to comply with labor discipline himself, but also won over others and spread backward ideas. Another example is Sun Guangfu, a worker in the mechanical workshop, who took unwarranted leave or was absent from work in order to earn more money, or used odd shifts and Sundays to work at the private Yonghe Welding Factory. He always believed that working in state-owned factories was "not very profitable," and consistently failed to comply with labor discipline, which had a very bad impact on the workers.
    3.  Labor discipline education in the past was poor, and cadres' understanding of consolidating labor discipline was incorrect. Some people took a lenient attitude towards employees who violated labor discipline, saying, "Let's just let it go, it won't affect the production task!" Others believed that there was national law and factory regulations, and whoever did not comply would be punished. When explaining the internal labor rules of the factory to the employees, they did not focus on explaining the content and meaning, but used a threatening tone, saying, "Remember, you will be expelled for four days of unwarranted absence!" When they found workers in their workshops who did not comply with labor discipline, they did not patiently educate them, but asked the leaders to hold a comrade trial meeting. Even if so-called "education" was sometimes carried out, it was mostly criticism, asking them to write self-criticism letters, or giving punishments. As a result, the employees' ideological problems were not resolved, and the phenomenon of lax labor discipline still could not be overcome. It is precisely because of the above two incorrect thoughts among the cadres that the labor discipline education in the past was not conducted frequently. When the employees' attendance was not good, labor discipline education became active; when the attendance rate improved slightly, labor discipline education ended accordingly. This is one of the important reasons why the phenomenon of some employees violating labor discipline has not been completely resolved.
    4.  The administrative management system is not strict or sound, the implementation of piecework wages is not good enough, rewards are not timely, and planning is not meticulous, resulting in idle work, which also affects the consolidation of labor discipline.
    After the above investigation and analysis, the cadres had a clear understanding of the labor discipline compliance of the employees in their enterprises; and more importantly, it made the cadres further recognize the importance of consolidating labor discipline, and recognize that the education of consolidating labor discipline is an intense struggle to improve the employees' socialist consciousness and overcome the influence of petty-bourgeois, especially bourgeois, ideology. They realized that in terms of education methods, it is necessary to adopt the method of using the advanced to educate the backward and patiently persuade them, and any simple and crude methods are wrong. It is necessary to encourage workers to carry out criticism and self-criticism so that employees can consciously maintain labor discipline. At the same time, it is also recognized that this education must be closely combined with production and carried out regularly; in particular, it must be combined with improving the level of enterprise management. Only in this way can labor discipline be truly consolidated.
    After clarifying the situation and determining the direction, they then used the method of detailed accounting to specifically educate employees to recognize the losses caused to the country by violating labor discipline.
    According to factory statistics, from January to October of last year, employees were late, left early, and were absent from work without reason for a total of more than 295,000 hours, which is equivalent to 254 employees not producing for half a year. If these working days were used in production, 332 freight cars could be manufactured, creating a value of more than 19.18 billion yuan for the country. Due to non-compliance with operating procedures, mechanical and personal accidents caused work stoppages from January to October of last year, totaling 9,631 work days, equivalent to 191,116,800 yuan. Using these figures to educate employees on compliance with labor discipline through cartoons, broadcasts, and other forms gave everyone a deep impression.
    Another method of education is to vigorously promote the thoughts and deeds of advanced figures.
    Comrade Huang Chengyu (a Communist Party member), a planing machine worker in the mechanical workshop, has consistently complied with labor discipline since he joined the factory in February 1948, and has persisted in not being absent from work for six years and eight months. He humbly learned technology from veteran workers, conscientiously promoted advanced Soviet experience, and conscientiously implemented operating procedures and safety regulations. He has not produced a single defective product in the past seven years, and has not had any machine or personal accidents in six years and eight months. He cherishes machine tools like a soldier cherishes weapons. He checks the machine tools for problems every day before starting the machine, and regularly oils and carefully cleans them. After studying the general line, his consciousness was further improved, and he, together with technicians and other workers, put forward five rationalization proposals, which doubled production efficiency. Under his leadership, the entire group gloriously won the title of Provincial Industrial Model Group.
    Why has Comrade Huang Chengyu been able to consistently comply with labor discipline? He said: "Because I realize that today I am the master of the country. I think that no matter how big a personal matter is, it is not as important as the factory's affairs. If one person's absence affects the completion of the factory's production tasks, what a great loss it will cause to the country's industrialization! When I see the locomotives made with my personal participation, I am happy from the bottom of my heart, because I know that they are directly participating in the country's economic construction. Whenever I have something to ask for leave, I don't ask for it because I think that factory production is important. In 1948, my 60-year-old mother wanted to come to Qiqihar from home to see me, but it was a long way, and she was old and could not come alone. At that time, I asked the workshop leaders for seven days of leave to pick her up, but when I thought that the people of the whole country were fighting for the liberation of all of China, and the factory's production tasks were particularly tense, the cars we repaired were to fight Chiang Kai-shek and eliminate the reactionaries, and we must not let personal absenteeism affect the completion of the tasks and affect the victory of the Liberation War, so I finally decided not to ask for leave and continued to go to work. In 1950, my wife gave birth to a baby, and there was no one at home to take care of her. I planned to ask for leave, but when I thought that at that time, we were in the midst of the vigorous struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, how could we stop working? So I comforted her and said: Although we have overthrown the Kuomintang reactionaries and are living a good life, the US imperialists are not dead, and they still want to invade us. We must resolutely not agree. In order to defeat the American devils, defend our country and protect our homes, we must not stop working. Let's endure our own small difficulties. As a result, her thinking was also cleared up, and I went to work again."
    All the workshops in the factory vigorously publicized Comrade Huang Chengyu's deeds among the employees, and the employees used him as a mirror to examine themselves and improve their consciousness. Li Renguang, a young worker in the material workshop, said: "I have consistently failed to comply with labor discipline, averaging only four or five hours of work a day. I always thought that I earned 158 points a month, and doing a little work was enough to be worthy of the country. Compared with Comrade Huang Chengyu, I am too ashamed. I didn't know that I was a member of the working class and the master of the factory. I always thought that the factory now was no different from the factory in the puppet Manchukuo period. I always wanted to treat my own factory the way I used to treat the Japanese devils. This time I realized my mistake and I must learn from Comrade Huang Chengyu, actively produce, and create more wealth for the country so that the country can achieve socialism as soon as possible." From then on, he really changed. He ensured eight hours of work every day. In the past, he could only cut 600 kilograms of scrap iron a day, but now he cuts 2,000 kilograms.
    After such education, a wave of consciously maintaining labor discipline was set off among the employees.
    For backward workers, they use individual conversations to patiently enlighten and educate them.
    This work was done relatively well in the material workshop. Jing Youdao, a worker in this workshop, started working in the factory in April 1951. He consistently failed to comply with labor discipline, always thinking that he didn't earn enough money. In production, he did not obey leadership assignments and often fought with others. From the time he joined the factory until now, he has been absent and late for more than 170 days. In his work, he would do piecework and work that earned a lot of money, but he would loaf around on timekeeping work or work that earned less money. He did not cherish state property. In April 1952, he placed more than 30 meters of gas belts and wind belts on the railway track and damaged them, for which he was given a major demerit. Since then, his problems have developed even more. He not only did not cherish state property, but also stole things from the factory. He has always been uneasy about production and always wanted to jump ship. He never participated in various political studies, and most of the production plans were not completed.
    After learning about these situations, Comrade Han Zengchang, the branch secretary, had an individual conversation with him, asking him why he consistently failed to comply with labor discipline and still wanted to jump ship? He said: "Anyway, the leaders look down on me, and the Party members and Youth League members don't get close to me. I can't do a good job either." After saying these words, he fell silent, and the first conversation ended like this. Later, after learning about it, it was mainly because he had concerns and was afraid of being punished. Comrade Han Zengchang had a second conversation with him, dispelling his concerns. Then he initially reviewed his violations of labor discipline. However, his review was extremely shallow, emphasizing the objective, saying that the leaders did not promote his technical level or increase his salary, so he did not comply with labor discipline. Finally, he also asked to jump ship. After this conversation, it was initially learned that this person valued personal interests very much. But why is this so? Comrade Han Zengchang repeatedly considered it and talked to Party members to learn from all aspects. Finally, he learned that: Jing Youdao worked as an apprentice in the Shenyang Bridge Factory when he was 17 years old, and then worked in the private Lihua Iron Factory for four years. After the Five-Anti Campaign, he came to the railway factory. He was deeply influenced by bourgeois ideology and had serious selfish and self-interested thoughts. He often said: It is not satisfying to earn a "gold mountain" at home. He always believed that he earned more in private factories than in state-owned factories. This time, he wanted to jump ship to work in a private shop in Qingdao. At the same time, it was also learned that: Jing Youdao's family used to be very poor and had suffered all kinds of oppression. His father had been a laborer and later died of illness after being beaten by officials of the puppet Manchukuo because he could not afford to pay taxes. In this way, Comrade Han Zengchang had a third conversation with Jing Youdao. First, he conducted class education by comparing the past and present lives and the old and new societies, and then used the fact that he had been influenced by bourgeois ideas when he worked in private factories in the past to illustrate the essence of bourgeois profiteering, pointed out that his idea of going to work in private factories was wrong, explained that violating labor discipline was an act of undermining the long-term interests of the working class, and conducted education in connection with the general line. This conversation moved Jing Youdao, and he cried. Then Comrade Han Zengchang had several more conversations with him, and finally improved his consciousness. He painfully reviewed himself at the group meeting, felt that his past violations of labor discipline were shameful, and expressed his determination to produce well and strive to join the Youth League. In the past, he could only cut one ton of iron plates a day, but now he has increased to more than three tons.
    This fully illustrates that every backward employee's backwardness has a certain reason, and as long as they are patiently educated, they can all be transformed, and individual conversations are an effective method of educating these employees.
    After the education of labor discipline, the employees' ideological awareness has been improved a step further. A considerable number of employees who violated labor discipline have been transformed. Various workshops have helped them formulate conditions for participating in labor competitions and guided them to actively improve production. Therefore, new atmospheres have appeared in production. The attendance rate of the freight car workshop in October of last year was 95.34 percent. After labor discipline education, it increased to 95.5 percent in November. There were 518 absentees in October, which decreased to 297 in November. Many transformed workers have also put forward rationalization proposals, which have improved production efficiency.

    一次成功的劳动纪律教育
    中共黑龙江省委宣传部工作组
    齐齐哈尔机车车辆制造工厂在去年冬天向全厂职工较为集中地进行了一次劳动纪律教育，收到很大的效果。
    他们的做法是：首先通过各车间的党员、团员和宣传员，对所属十五个车间的四千一百多名职工遵守劳动纪律的情况进行调查分析。调查的结果是：有百分之五十的职工一贯遵守劳动纪律，严守工作岗位，每天保证八小时工作，服从领导分配，和大家团结互助，爱护国家财产，能够模范地完成生产任务。如货车车间工人肇忠文，二年来因工作需要被调动七次，从来没讲过价钱，一贯服从领导分配。在生产中爱惜每一分钟的时间；坚持三年十一个月没欠过一次勤。同时很热心地帮助别人。有一次干活时靴子不够用，他就把自己的靴子让给别人穿，自己的棉裤湿了半截，也没有一句怨言，仍旧紧张愉快地工作着。工人们被感动地说：“我们跟你干一辈子活也不知道累。”像他这样的范例还很多。将近百分之四十的职工能够遵守劳动纪律，但比较看重个人利益，有时计较工作岗位，对违犯劳动纪律的人不能展开斗争。还有百分之十的人对生产漠不关心，一贯不遵守劳动纪律，并有严重的违法乱纪行为。这样的人绝大部分是青工，他们的具体表现是：
    一、每天不能保证八小时工作，经常迟到早退。在生产时间打闹，工作不紧张，任意消耗时间，到点不开工，不到点就提前洗手去饭堂吃饭。在夜班生产时睡觉打盹。经常无故欠勤旷工。货车车间青工罗云阁和张洪德在生产时间互相贴纸王八玩。苏宝林平均每天只干三小时工作，到处闲蹓跶，别人问他为啥这样，他说：“咱们货车间家大人多，蹓跶一回也不要紧。”配件车间工人李学信，经常歇工，去年六月份只上了一天班，还迟到一个钟头。机械车间青工陈玉和在干“侧架”时，因为累，挣钱又不多，就回到家里歇起来，使床子停工八小时，严重地影响了生产。
    二、轻视产品质量，工作马虎大意，不遵守工艺规程和安全规程，不断发生机械事故和人身事故。如配件车间黎泽根不遵守操作规程，单纯赶数量，有一个月出了四十四件废品。车间干部教育他时，他不虚心接受，反而提出三项要求：调到别的车间去；改换职务；永远不实行计件工资。锅炉车间工人陈志运，在工作中马虎大意，胳膊被皮带绞断了。货车车间青工崔显荣在干活时扔下床子到事务室找女职员研究唱京剧，床子没人看管，把牙轮咬坏了。
    三、不服从领导分配，消极怠工。利材车间瓦斯组全组二十多名工人都不安心工作，一天干不了两小时活，漫骂领导，不服从分配，在生产时间演
  “双簧”。该组工人齐连生有一天除了给自己做了一把菜刀外什么活也没干。铸钢车间开天车工人黄凯，整天泡病号，还说：“大错不犯，小错不断，看领导上怎么办。”
    四、极少数职工还有贪污、偷盗、赌博、投机捣把，严重违法乱纪的行为。机车车间工人崔荣和，到市场去捣卖手表和偷钱，被公安局逮捕。货车车间周玉德夜间在家耍钱，早晨他爱人叫他起来上班，他不但不听，还打他爱人。运输车间青工多报计件工时，贪污计件工资。冷轮车间青工丁锡仲借口回家，贪污免票车费三十多万元。锻冶车间青工曹永昌等甚至经常在街上乱追女人。以上这些非工人阶级的行为，虽是少数人造成的，但影响极坏。
    为什么这少部分职工不遵守劳动纪律呢？主要原因是：
    一、从一九五二年以来，新工人大量增加。他们是来自其他各个阶级的，出身也不同。有的刚从学校毕业，有的刚放下农具。入厂动机也不同。因之，入厂后就带来了一些与集体纪律不相容的小私有者的思想作风：自由散漫，过不惯集体生活，有严重的经济主义倾向。在生产中不服从领导，工作讲价钱，闹工薪。有的人公开说：“计件抢着干，计时泡着干，够本慢点干”。“挣钱多就干，挣钱少不干，活轻就干，活累不干，顺心就干，不顺心就不干”。
    二、有个别职工受了资产阶级思想影响，生产不安心，总想到私营工厂去干活。如工人马广义，受了资本家拉拢，总嫌挣钱少，闹情绪，想跳厂，在生产中不仅自己不遵守劳动纪律，还拉拢别人，散布落后的思想。再如机械车间工人孙广福，为了多挣钱，无故请假旷工，或利用捣班和星期天，到私营永和熔接工厂干活。他总认为在国营工厂干活“油水不大”，一贯不遵守劳动纪律，给工人影响极坏。
    三、过去劳动纪律教育差，干部对巩固劳动纪律的认识不正确。有的人对违犯劳动纪律的职工采取迁就态度，说什么：“小小不然就算了吧，不影响生产任务就行呗！”有的人则认为有国法，有厂规，谁不遵守就处罚谁。他们在向职工讲解工厂内部劳动细则时，不是着重解释内容和意义，而是用威胁的口吻说：“你们记住，无故旷工四天就开除！”他们发现本车间有不遵守劳动纪律的工人，不是耐心教育，而是要求领导上开同志审判会。即或有时进行了所谓“教育”，也多是批评，叫写检讨书，或是给处分。结果职工思想问题没得到解决，劳动纪律松懈现象仍然不能克服。正由于在干部中存在以上两种不正确的思想，所以过去的劳动纪律教育进行得不经常，当职工出勤状况不好时，劳动纪律教育就活跃起来；出勤率稍有好转，劳动纪律教育就随之结束了。这就是一部分职工违犯劳动纪律现象没有能彻底解决的重要原因之一。
    四、行政管理上制度不严，不健全，计件工资推行得不够好，奖励不及时，计划不周密，有窝工现象，这些也影响了劳动纪律的巩固。
    经过以上的调查分析，使干部对本企业职工遵守劳动纪律的情况心中有了数；而更重要的是使干部进一步认识了巩固劳动纪律的重要性，认识了巩固劳动纪律的教育就是提高职工的社会主义觉悟，克服小资产阶级特别是资产阶级思想影响的一场激烈的斗争。认识到在教育方法上，必须采取以先进教育落后和耐心说服的方法，任何简单粗暴的做法都是错误的。必须启发工人开展批评与自我批评，使职工自觉地维护劳动纪律。同时也认识到这一教育必须紧紧结合生产来经常进行；尤其必须和提高企业管理水平结合起来。只有这样，劳动纪律才能真正巩固。
    在摸清了情况，确定了方针之后，他们接着用算细帐的办法来具体地教育职工认识违犯劳动纪律给国家造成的损失。
    全厂统计，去年一至十月份，职工迟到、早退、无故旷工，共达二十九万五千多小时，等于二百五十四个职工半年没有生产。假如这些工作日用在生产上，可以制造三百三十二辆货车，给国家创造一百九十一亿八千多万元的价值，由于不遵守操作规程，去年一至十月份造成机械和人身事故以致停工生产达九千六百三十一个工，合一亿九千一百一十六万八千元。通过漫画、广播等形式，用这些数目字向职工进行遵守劳动纪律教育，给了大家很深的印象。
    教育的另一方式是大力宣传先进人物的思想和事迹。
    机械车间刨床工黄成玉同志（共产党员），自从一九四八年二月入厂以来，一贯遵守劳动纪律，坚持了六年零八个月没有欠过一次勤。他虚心向老工人学习技术，认真推广苏联先进经验，认真执行操作规程和安全规程，七年来没有出过一件废品，六年零八个月没有发生过机器和人身事故。他爱护机床像战士爱护武器一样。每天开车前都要检查一下机床是否有毛病，并且按时给油，细心清扫。学习总路线以后，他的觉悟进一步提高，和技术人员和别的工人一起提出了五件合理化建议，使生产效率提高了一倍。在他的带动下，全小组光荣地获得了省工业模范小组的称号。
    黄成玉同志为什么能够一贯遵守劳动纪律呢？他说：“因为我认识到了今天我是国家的主人。我认为个人有天大的事情也不能比工厂的事情要紧。如果因为一个人欠勤，影响全厂生产任务不能完成，那该给国家工业化造成多大损失！我看到有我亲自参加做出的一台一台的机车，打心眼里往外乐，因为我知道它们直接参加了祖国的经济建设。我每当有事想请假，但一想到工厂生产重要，就不请了。一九四八年，我六十多岁的老母亲想从家里来齐齐哈尔看我，可是路远，她岁数大，不能一个人来，当时我向车间领导上请了七天假想去接她，可是一想到现在全国人民正在为解放全中国奋斗，工厂生产任务特别紧张，我们所修的车就是为了打蒋介石，消灭反动派，绝不能因为个人缺勤影响任务不能完成，影响了解放战争的胜利，所以最后决定不请假了，又坚持上了班。一九五○年，我爱人生了个娃娃，家里没有人照顾她。我打算请假，可是又想到当时正处在轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝斗争的时候，怎么能歇工呢，所以我就安慰她说：咱们虽然打倒了国民党反动派，过了好日子，可是美帝国主义不死心，还想侵略咱们，咱们坚决不能答应，为了打败美国鬼子，卫国保家，决不能歇工，我们自己的小困难忍耐一下吧。结果她思想也通了，我又上了班。”
    全厂各个车间都把黄成玉同志的事迹在职工中进行了大力宣传，职工们都以他为镜子对照检查了自己，提高了觉悟。利材车间青工李仁光说：“我一贯不遵守劳动纪律，每天平均只干四、五小时工作，总认为自己一个月挣一百五十八分，多少干点活就对得起国家了。这和黄成玉同志对照起来太惭愧了。我不知道自己是工人阶级，是工厂的主人，总认为现在工厂和伪满时候的工厂没啥区别，总想拿过去对待小日本鬼子的办法对待自己的工厂，这回认识到了自己的错误，一定向黄成玉同志学习，积极生产，多给国家创造财富，使国家早日实现社会主义。”他从此真转变了，每天保证了八小时工作，过去一天最多割六百公斤碎铁，现在割两千公斤。
    经过这样的教育，职工中就掀起了自觉地维护劳动纪律的热潮。
    对落后的工人，他们用个别谈话的方式来耐心启发教育。
    这一工作做得比较好的是利材车间。这个车间的工人荆有堂是一九五一年四月到厂工作的。一贯不遵守劳动纪律，总认为挣得太少，在生产中不服从领导分配，经常和别人打架，从入厂到现在，欠勤和迟到有一百七十多天。在工作中，遇到实行计件工资的和挣钱多的活就干，计时工资的活或挣钱少的活就磨洋工。不爱护国家财产。一九五二年四月，他把三十多公尺的瓦斯带和风带放在火车道上被压坏，因此被记大过一次。从此以后，他的毛病更发展了，不仅不爱护国家财产，还盗窃工厂的东西。他生产一贯不安心，总想跳厂，各种政治学习从来不参加，生产计划大部分完不成。
    支部书记韩增昌同志了解了这些情况后，就找他个别谈话，问他为什么一贯不遵守劳动纪律，还想跳厂？他说：“反正领导上看不起我，党团员也不靠近我，干也干不好了。”说完这几句话他就不响了，第一次谈话就这样结束了。后来一了解，主要是他有顾虑，怕受处罚。韩增昌同志第二次和他谈话，打消了他这个顾虑：于是他就初步的检讨了自己违犯劳动纪律的行为。但是他的检讨极不深刻，强调客观，说什么领导上不给他提升技术等级，不给他增加工资，所以不遵守劳动纪律，最后他还要求跳厂。经过这次谈话，初步了解到这个人对个人利益是看得非常重的。可是为什么会这样呢？韩增昌同志反复地考虑，又找党员谈话，从各方面了解。终于了解到：荆有堂十七岁时在沈阳桥梁工厂当学徒后，在私营利华铁工厂干了四年，五反斗争以后，才来到铁路工厂。他受资产阶级思想影响极深，自私自利思想严重，他常说：往家挣个“金山”也不解渴。总认为在国营工厂不如在私营工厂挣的多。这次跳厂是想到青岛私人铺口干活去。同时也了解到：荆有堂过去家庭也是很穷的，受过各种压迫，他父亲当过劳工，后来因为出不起税款被伪满官吏打的得病死了。这样，韩增昌同志又找荆有堂进行了第三次谈话。首先用过去和现在的生活，新旧社会的对比，进行了阶级教育，然后用他过去在私营工厂干活所受到的资产阶级影响的事实，说明资产阶级唯利是图的本质，指出了他想到私营工厂干活的想法是错误的，说明了违犯劳动纪律是破坏工人阶级长远利益的行为，并且联系总路线进行了教育。这次谈话打动了荆有堂，他哭了。接着韩增昌同志又连续和他谈了几次话，终于提高了他的觉悟，他在小组会上痛心地检讨了自己，感到过去违犯劳动纪律的行为是可耻的，表示决心好好生产，争取入团。从前他一天只能割一吨铁板，现在已经提高到三吨多。
    由此可以充分说明，每个落后职工的落后都是有一定原因的，只要耐心教育，都是能够转变过来的，而个别谈话是教育这些职工的一种有效的方法。
    经过劳动纪律的教育，职工思想觉悟提高了一步。有相当多的违犯劳动纪律的职工转变了，各个车间都帮助他们制订了参加劳动竞赛的条件，引导他们积极搞好生产，因此在生产中都出现了新的气象。货车车间去年十月份出勤率是百分之九十五点三四，经过劳动纪律教育后，十一月份提高到百分之九十五点五，十月份旷工五百一十八个，十一月份降低到二百九十七个。有不少转变了的工人还提出合理化建议，提高了生产效率。
