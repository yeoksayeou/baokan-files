Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 8th. The Indian "New China" monthly's January 1955 editorial condemns the United States for signing the US-Chiang treaty and slandering China in the American spy case.

The editorial said: Ignoring the warnings of the Chinese people, the American imperialists actually concluded a "joint defense treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which relies on American bayonets for survival and whose sole occupation is to provoke new wars. The United States attempts to use this treaty to give a legal cloak to its act of forcibly occupying China's territory, Taiwan, because since the end of the Korean War, it has lost any excuse to invade Taiwan again. The editorial said: This treaty has undoubtedly increased the danger of the United States invading China.

The editorial continued: In order to cover up its naked policy of aggression against China and to worsen international tensions, the American imperialists are using the case of thirteen American spies to slander China for violating the Korean Armistice Agreement and are carrying out vicious propaganda against China. The editorial said: It is ridiculous that these are the very people who violated the Korean Armistice Agreement, they forcibly detained 48,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war and then incorporated them into the armies of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek, and now they are trying to accuse China. In fact, these thirteen Americans were not captured in Korea but in China. They were parachuted into Northeast China to spy on China's military secrets. They themselves have pleaded guilty in court. Their arrest and sentencing is China's internal affair, and neither the United States nor the United Nations has any right to interfere. Regardless of the irrefutable evidence and in complete violation of truth and justice, the United Nations, under pressure from the United States, passed a resolution condemning China. This also proves how the United Nations has become a tool of American foreign policy.

    印度“新中国”月刊发表社论
    谴责美蒋条约和美国诬蔑我国的行为
    【新华社新德里八日电】印度“新中国”月刊一九五五年一月号的社论，谴责美国签订美蒋条约并在美国间谍案件上诬蔑中国的行为。
    社论说：美帝国主义者不顾中国人民的警告，竟同依靠美国刺刀而生存的、以挑起新战争为唯一职业的蒋介石集团缔结了“共同防御条约”。美国企图用这个条约使它武力侵占中国领土台湾的行动披上合法的外衣，因为自从朝鲜战争结束以后，已经失掉再侵占台湾的任何借口了。社论说：这个条约无疑已经增加了美国侵略中国的危险。
    社论接着说：美帝国主义者为了达到掩盖它对中国的赤裸裸的侵略政策以及使国际紧张局势恶化的目的，正在利用十三名美国间谍的事件诬蔑中国违反朝鲜停战协定，并针对中国进行恶毒的宣传。社论说：说来可笑的是：正是这些人他们自己违反了朝鲜停战协定，他们曾经强迫扣留四万八千名朝、中战俘，然后把他们编入李承晚和蒋介石的军队，而他们现在反而试图指责中国。事实上，这十三个美国人不是在朝鲜捕获而是在中国境内捕获的。他们是空降在中国东北，去刺探中国的军事秘密的。他们自己已经在法庭上认了罪。他们的被捕和判刑是中国的内政，对此，美国和联合国都没有任何权利干涉。不顾无可非议的证据并完全违反真理和正义，联合国在美国的压力下通过了谴责中国的决议。这也证明，联合国是怎样成为美国外交政策的工具的。
