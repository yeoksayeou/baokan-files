To the Editor:

The waste phenomenon in the Suzhou Public-Private Joint Suzhou Electric Company is quite serious. In labor costs, the expenditure on temporary worker wages is very high, with an average of one temporary worker for every ten employees being a common occurrence. When handling routine tasks such as moving tools or extending utility poles in various work areas, the company's own movers and line workers remain idle, and temporary workers are hired from outside. According to calculations, of the more than 11.8 million yuan spent on temporary workers in the second and third quarters of last year, half could have been saved. The consumption of gasoline in transportation and repair expenses is very high, mainly because there is no strict management system for the use of motor vehicles. For example, when employees go out to repair lines, they sometimes do not carry heavy tools, and the distance is not far, so they could have ridden bicycles, but instead, cars are dispatched. According to statistics from January to September last year, gasoline expenditures totaled more than 9.8 million yuan, of which more than one-third could have been saved. As for office expenses and administrative management expenses, the waste phenomenon is even more serious. The company distributes four liang of tea to each worker every month, and many workers cannot finish it, so they let the tea get moldy and throw it away. Of the eighty quilts sewn by the company for night shift workers, most were taken away, and only five or six remain. The company purchased more than one hundred flashlights in a few months, and now more than half have been lost.

The emergence of these situations is because the company has shortcomings in its business management work and some employees do not cherish public property, but the fundamental reason is that the leading cadres do not pay enough attention to the regular work of increasing production and practicing economy. Although the company's leadership began to pay attention to this waste situation in November last year and mobilized employees to conduct inspections, they have not yet made a serious self-criticism of the shortcomings in their work.

### 苏州电气公司应严肃纠正浪费现象

    苏州电气公司应严肃纠正浪费现象编辑同志：
    苏州市公私合营苏州电气公司浪费现象相当严重。在劳务费用中，临时工工资的支出很大，经常的情况是平均每十个职工有一个临时工。各工区在搬运工具、延长电线杆子等日常事务操作中，公司里的搬运工和线路工人闲着，还要在外边招揽临时工。据核算，去年二、三季度一千一百八十多万元临时工费用，其中有二分之一是可以节省的。运输修理费用中的汽油耗费量很大，其原因主要是对机动车辆的行驶没有严格的管理制度。如职工外出检修线路，有时并不携带笨重的工具，路程也不远，本来可以骑自行车，结果却开出了汽车。据去年一月至九月统计，汽油支出共九千八百多万元，其中有三分之一以上是可以节省的。至于在办公费用和事务管理费用方面，浪费现象就更严重。这个公司每月给每个工人发四两茶叶，许多工人用不完，把茶叶放霉了就扔掉。公司为夜班工作人员缝制的八十床被子，大部被人拿走，至今只剩下五、六条。公司几个月中购置了一百多只手电筒，现在散失了一半以上。
    这些情况的产生，是因为公司在经营管理工作上有缺点和部分职工对公共财产不爱护，而其根本原因，则是领导干部对经常的增产节约工作重视不够。去年十一月间公司领导方面虽然已经开始注意这种浪费情况，发动职工进行检查，但是对自己工作中的缺点还没有进行严肃的检讨。
