Meeting the Pioneers of Virgin Land in Moscow
By Li He, Our Correspondent in Moscow

    On January 15th, I met Muscovites who volunteered to participate in the reclamation of virgin lands and those who returned from the reclaimed areas for vacation. The meeting was held at the Moscow City Committee of the Lenin Communist Youth League—the headquarters of the Moscow Youth League. Of course, it was impossible to invite all the volunteers and all those on vacation to participate, as there were seven thousand volunteers and just as many on vacation. Only fifteen people were present at the meeting. All the young people were healthy and full of vitality. Comrades from the City Committee suggested that I talk directly to them about the issues I was interested in.

    I approached a young man who looked like he had been to the virgin lands. His name was Vladimir Ivanovich Kuzyakin, and he used to work in a Moscow municipal agency.

    I said to him, "You look like someone who has been to the virgin lands. Your face is weathered, your hands are rough and hard, and your demeanor is no longer that of a Muscovite. You look like someone from the countryside. Look at yourself, you'll be surprised."

    He did not refute my words.

    I asked him to talk about himself.

    "I was among the first to go to the virgin lands in 1954," Kuzyakin said.

    "Why did you join the reclamation effort?" I asked.

    "I believe that area is the main front for fighting to improve the lives of our people. The two hundred of us from the Red Guard District, like people united for a common purpose, quickly became acquainted and soon formed a united collective. When we arrived in the virgin lands, we got off the train near a small wooden sign that read 'Red Guard State Farm.' Some immediately went to see the tractors that would be going to the fields the next day, while others started working with the building materials needed to build houses. In a month and a half, we built twenty-six Finnish-style small houses and plowed nearly 20,000 hectares of virgin land. Later, we built schools, hospitals, clubs, and even a guest hotel. Now we want to create a large garden. My monthly salary is at least between 900 and 1300 rubles."

    "Do you get enough rest?" I asked with concern.

    "To be honest, we are not lonely at all. We have an orchestra, a large library, and some amateur art groups."

    This Muscovite spoke so enthusiastically about the Kazakh steppes that he loved.

    A young couple—Vasily Douarigin and Valigina Karigina—sat alone away from everyone else. I went over and asked them, "Where did you get married?"

    "In Moscow, we decided to go to the virgin lands, so we wrote two applications, one to the district committee of the Youth League, requesting to be sent to the virgin lands, and the other to the Civil Registry Office...."

    I asked them to talk a little about themselves.

    "We used to work at the 'Proletarian Labor' factory. I was the leader of a dispatch worker group, and my wife was a female worker who watched over automatic machines. I earned nearly 1,500 rubles a month at the factory. In the virgin lands, I can earn more, nearly 3,000 rubles a month, and my wife can earn 1,000 rubles," said Vasily Douarigin.

    "Our monthly food expenses are only 500 to 600 rubles. We have our own vegetable garden, where we grow potatoes, cabbage, cucumbers, and even have dairy cows, hens, and other poultry. We plan to buy a "ΓA3—69" car."

    This was told to me by his wife, a fair-haired, pale-faced woman. On the surface, she seemed a little thin, but you could see that she was full of energy. Her husband was a stark contrast to her. He had very broad shoulders and a serious expression, and he was obviously used to doing everything in a slow, methodical manner. He spoke as if he were driving a tractor, slow but steady. It was easy to imagine him driving a tractor to plow the virgin land.

    Standing next to this young couple were two friends from the "Red Proletarian" factory: Mikhail Yeroshin, a twenty-four-year-old foundry worker and team leader, and his teammate, nineteen-year-old Sherin Anatoly. Sherin was a young man with reddish-brown skin. The team leader said that three people from their team had gone to participate in the reclamation last year, and three more would be going this year.

    "Where do you want to go?" I asked.

    "To the new state farm in Altai," they answered in unison.

    Looking at them, one would believe that the virgin land would yield to the hands of these seemingly young children.

    "We are not the only ones who want to go," the team leader said proudly. "Two hundred people from our factory have applied to go to the reclamation."

    Standing next to them was an energetic young man with short hair, a very lively expression, and a bit of a loud manner. I got to know him. His last name was Vinogradov, and his first name was Dmitry. He was among the second group to go to the virgin lands in 1953. He asked to go to the Altai Territory because he had worked there as an aviation mechanic in the military. He said:

    "Now I work as a tractor driver at the 'Yashensky' machine and tractor station, which serves twelve collective farms. The work quota is to complete the task of plowing 5.4 hectares of virgin land or 6.4 hectares of cultivated land in every ten hours of work, which counts as five workdays. I got a total of five hundred workdays. And the reward for each workday is seven rubles and three kilograms of grain. The first furrow I plowed was interesting, all crooked. But the second and third times were much better. Harvesting was much more difficult because there was so much rain. In one day, we could only harvest three or four hectares. Later, the weather improved, and we still completed the plan. Our harvest was very good, yielding twenty centners per hectare of virgin land and fifteen centners per hectare of cultivated land."

      There were also two girlfriends: one who was about to leave, Maria Agafonova; and another, Kolava Yakupova, who said that in the spring, her "young man" would be discharged from the army, and they would go to the virgin lands together.

      All those who volunteered to reclaim the virgin lands promised to work there as well as they did in Moscow. Their Moscow friends often cared for them. For example, students from vocational schools made more than 20,000 various tools for the reclamation workers. Young workers at the Kalinin District Machine Building Factory repaired a drilling lathe and a planer with their own efforts and sent them from Moscow to a state farm in the Akmolinsk region. The Communist Youth League organization of the mechanical factory sent three boxes of spare parts. Communist Youth League members from the First Bearing Factory, the Stalin Automobile Factory, and many other enterprises actively helped the reclamation workers. Muscovites sent hundreds of thousands of books, hundreds of musical instruments, and hundreds of gramophone records to the reclamation areas. Currently, the gifts sent from Moscow City and Moscow Oblast to the reclamation areas are worth a total of two million rubles.

    Seven thousand Muscovites, fifteen thousand Ukrainians, the same number of Belarusians, eleven thousand Kuban people, fifteen hundred Leningraders, and tens of thousands of young men and women from other republics and cities of the Soviet Union went to carry out the task proposed by the Party of reclaiming thirty million hectares of virgin land. In front of this great army of reclamation, in front of the ardent executors of the Party's will, the virgin land will surely yield; it will produce so much grain that it will meet all the needs of the Soviet people and meet the needs of animal husbandry. The Soviet people need so much grain for export and for establishing the necessary reserves.

    会见开荒的莫斯科人
    本报驻莫斯科记者　李何
    一月十五日我会见了志愿参加开垦荒地的莫斯科人和从垦区回来休假的人们。会见是在列宁共产主义青年团莫斯科市委会——莫斯科青年团总部举行的。当然，邀请所有的志愿开荒者和所有的休假者来参加是不可能的，因为志愿开荒者的人数有七千人，休假的也有这么多。在这里会见的一共只有十五个人。所有的青年都身体健壮、生气勃勃。市委会的同志建议我直接和他们谈谈我所感到兴趣的问题。
    我向一个看起来像是到过荒地的青年走去，这个人名叫弗拉季米尔·伊万诺维奇·库兹雅金，他过去在莫斯科市机关里工作。
    我向他说：“我看你像是到过荒地的人。看你满脸风霜，两手又粗又硬，你的神情已经不像是莫斯科人，你像是个外地人了。你看看吧，你会惊奇吧。”
    他没有反驳我的话。
    我请他谈谈自己。
    “我是一九五四年第一批到荒地上去的。”库兹雅金说。
    “你为什么参加开荒的？”我问。
    “我认为那里是为改善我们人民生活进行斗争的主要地区。我们从红色近卫军区来的两百个人，像平常为了共同目的团结在一起的人们一样，很快就熟起来了，而且很快就成了一个团结的集体。我们到了荒地，在一个上面写着“‘红色近卫军’国营农场”字样的小木牌附近下了车。一些人立刻去看第二天就要开到田里去的拖拉机，另外一些人则带上盖房子所必需的建筑材料开始去工作了。我们在一个半月中建筑了二十六栋芬兰式的小屋子，翻耕了近两万公顷的生荒地。以后又盖了学校、医院、俱乐部，甚至还有接待客人的旅馆，现在我们想开辟一个大花园。我每月的工资至少在九百到一千三百卢布之间。”
    “你们休息得好吗？”我关心地问道。
    “说老实话，我们一点也不寂寞。我们有管弦乐队，有一个很大的图书馆和一些业余艺术小组。”
    这个莫斯科人那样热情地同我谈起了他所喜欢的哈萨克草原。
    一对青年夫妇——华西里·杜阿里金和瓦里金娜·卡里金娜——离开所有的人独自坐在一旁。我走过去问他们：“请问，你们是在什么地方结婚的呢？”
    “在莫斯科，我们决定了要去开荒，就写了两个申请书，一个申请书送到青年团的区委会，要求派往荒地上去。另一个申请书送往户籍登记局……。”
    我要求他们稍稍谈谈自己。
    “以前我们在‘无产阶级劳动’工厂工作，我是调度工人小组的组长，而我的妻子则是一个看管自动机的女工。我在这个工厂里每月的收入近一千五百卢布，在生荒地上我可以拿到较多的工资，每月近三千卢布，而我的妻子则可以拿到一千卢布。”华西里·杜阿里金说。
    “我们每月的伙食费只需五百到六百卢布，我们有自己的菜园，有自己种的马铃薯、白菜、黄瓜，甚至还有乳牛、母鸡和别的一些家禽。我们准备买一部“ΓA3—69”小轿车。”
    这段话是他的妻子，这位头发淡黄、面孔很白的女子告诉我的。表面看来，她似乎有点瘦，但可以看得出她是富有精力的。而他的丈夫同她是一个明显的对比，他的肩膀非常宽，面部表情很严肃，显然是已经习惯于不慌不忙地、有条不紊地去进行一切工作了。他在谈话时也像开拖拉机一样，虽则慢但却很沉着。可以很容易地想像到他驾驶着翻耕生荒地的拖拉机的样子。
    在这对青年夫妇旁边站着的是从“红色无产者”工厂来的一对朋友：翻砂工人工作队长、二十四岁的米哈依尔·叶罗辛和他的工作队队员、十九岁的谢林·阿纳托里。谢林是一个皮肤带点红褐色的少年。队长说，他们工作队里去年已有三个人去参加开荒了，今年还有三个人要去。
    “你们想到哪儿去呢？”我问。
    “到阿尔泰的新国营农场去。”他们一齐回答说。
    看着他们的样子就会相信，生荒地是会屈服于这些乍看起来还是年轻的小孩子们的手下的。
    “要去的人决不只是我们，”队长自豪地说，
    “我们工厂已经有二百人申请去开荒了。”
    他们旁边站着一个生气勃勃的青年人，这个人留着短发，面部表情非常活泼，并且有点喜欢吵嚷。我和他认识了，他姓维诺格拉多夫，名叫德米特里，是一九五三年第二批到荒地去的，他当时要求到阿尔泰边疆区去，是因为他曾在那一带地区的军队中做过航空机械士。他说：
    “现在我在为十二个集体农庄服务的‘雅申斯基’机器拖拉机站做拖拉机手。工作定额是在每十小时工作时间完成耕五点四公顷生荒地或六点四公顷熟地的任务，算为五个劳动日。我共得到了五百个劳动日。而每一个劳动日的报酬是七个卢布和三公斤粮食。第一次我耕的犁沟才有意思呢，都是弯弯曲曲的。可是第二次、第三次就已经好得多了。收获的时候要困难得多，因为雨特别多。一天之中我们只能收割三公顷或四公顷，后来天气好起来，我们还是全部完成了计划。我们的收成很好，一公顷生荒地收二十公担，一公顷熟地收十五公担。”
      这儿还有一对女朋友：一个现在就要走了，她是玛丽亚·阿加弗诺娃；而另外一个是科拉娃·雅库波娃，她说，春天，她的“年轻人”退伍回来，他们就一同到荒地去。
      所有表示志愿去开垦荒地的人，都答应在那里要工作得和在莫斯科一样地好。他们的莫斯科朋友经常关怀他们。例如，工艺学校的同学给开荒的人制造了二万件以上的各种工具。加里宁区机器制造工厂的青年工人，用自己的力量修理了一部钻孔镟床和一部刨床，并且把它们从莫斯科送到阿科莫棱斯克州的国营农场。机械工厂的共青团组织送去了三箱子备用零件，第一轴承工厂、斯大林汽车工厂和其他许多企业的青年团员都积极帮助开荒的人。莫斯科人给开垦地区送去了几十万册书，几百具乐器，几百张留声机唱片。现在从莫斯科市和莫斯科州送到开垦地区去的礼物共计值二百万卢布。
    去执行党所提出的开垦三千万公顷荒地这一任务的，有七千名莫斯科人，还有一万五千名乌克兰人，同样数目的白俄罗斯人，一万一千名库班人，一千五百名列宁格勒人，以及从苏联的其他各共和国和城市来的几万名男女青年。在这支开荒大军面前，在党的意志的热烈的执行者的面前，荒地是一定会屈服的；它将会生产出那么多的粮食，满足苏联居民的一切需要，满足畜牧业的需要。为了输出和建立必要的储备，苏联人民是需要这许多粮食的。
