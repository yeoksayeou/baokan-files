    More Than 80,000 Workers in Shenyang Move into New Homes
    In 1954, Shenyang City constructed more than 500,900 square meters of dormitory buildings, and more than 80,000 workers moved into new homes. Most of these dormitory buildings were designed according to the 1953 standard model, with complete indoor facilities such as lighting, heating, and running water. Various flowers, plants and trees will be planted in the open spaces surrounding some of the collective dormitories in the future. Some dormitories have also added bus and trolley lines nearby, making it very convenient for workers to commute to and from work every day. Some workers who moved into new homes celebrated weddings, and some brought their families from the countryside.

    沈阳八万多名职工搬进新居
    沈阳市一九五四年建筑了五十万零九千多平方公尺的宿舍大楼，有八万多名职工搬进了新居。这些宿舍大楼大部分都是采用一九五三年标准型设计，室内有完善的照明、采暖、自来水等设备；在一些集体宿舍周围空地上，将来还要栽植各种花草树木。有的宿舍附近并增设了公共汽车和电车线路，每天职工上下班很方便。搬入新居的职工有的办了喜事，有的把家属从乡下接来。
