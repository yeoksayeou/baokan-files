To the Editor:

Last year, with the start of some basic construction projects in Wuhan, residents living in the construction areas have moved out one after another. Generally speaking, the relevant departments have paid attention to the mobilization, compensation, and resettlement work of the relocated households. However, there are still some shortcomings and errors in the demolition work.

Two years ago, when building the Jiang (Jianghan Road) Huang (Huangpu Road) section of Jiefang Avenue, some relocated households had to move several times in a row because the overall urban plan was not finalized. At that time, the masses had many opinions, but unfortunately, the relevant departments did not learn from this lesson. In early October last year, when building the riverside and embankment defenses along the Yangtze River in Hanyang, houses were demolished on a large scale within the construction "scope" that was "roughly about right" before the specific route was finalized. As a result, more than sixty houses that could have been left standing were demolished. When the construction of the Hanshui Highway Bridge began, the Construction Section of the Hanyang District People's Government mobilized twenty households, including Tao Lao Tai Tai (Old Lady Tao) of Wusheng Road in the construction area, to move to Gulou West Street. Now Gulou West Street is also within the construction area, and the Wuhan Demolition Committee has notified these residents, who have just rebuilt their homes, to move to Dunjialing again. Moving again and again has caused Tao Lao Tai Tai a lot of difficulties. There are other similar incidents.

Some cadres simply believe that demolition work is "fairly pricing per square meter, giving compensation, and letting them move." They are very poor at taking care of the relocated households' professions and other vital issues. When the Central South Electric Power Administration requisitioned land on Wansongyuan Road, it took in six farmers whose land had been requisitioned to become workers. Later, they did not use this land, but they also refused to take care of the farmers who had already been taken in! Some cadres do not bother to understand or solve the ideological problems and special difficulties of individual relocated households, but simply and rigidly adopt the method of "key education for stubborn elements," letting them "make self-criticisms" in front of the masses. This approach is obviously very wrong.

At present, there are still a few relocated households in Wuhan who have not been properly resettled, and several new basic construction projects are about to start, with nearly 5,000 more households to move. Therefore, it is urgent to earnestly learn from past lessons, carefully and thoroughly handle the requisition of land, and properly and promptly arrange the housing, employment, and livelihoods of relocated households.

### 武汉市建设中的拆迁工作急须改进

    武汉市建设中的拆迁工作急须改进编辑同志：
    去年，随着武汉市的部分基本建设工程的先后兴工，住在施工地区的居民已纷纷迁移。各有关部门对拆迁户的动员、补偿和安置工作一般说来是注意的，但是拆迁工作中还有一些缺点和错误。
    前年，在修建解放大道江（江汉路）黄（黄埔路）段时，由于城市总体规划没有确定，有些拆迁户曾一连搬了几次家，当时群众意见很多，可惜有关部门并没有接受这个教训。去年十月上旬修筑汉阳沿江沿河堤防时，具体的线路还没有最后确定，便在“大体上差不多”的施工“范围”内大拆房屋。结果，可以不拆而拆了的房子有六十几栋。当汉水公路桥开始施工时，汉阳区人民政府建设科曾经动员施工地区武圣路的陶老太太等二十户居民迁往鼓楼西街。现在鼓楼西街又在施工地区以内，武汉市拆迁委员会又通知这些刚刚重建起家园的居民再迁往顿甲岭。这样一迁再迁，给陶老太太造成了不少困难。类似这样的事件还有。
    有些干部把拆迁工作简单地认为就是“按平方公尺公平议价，给予赔偿，让他搬家”。而对拆迁户的职业和生活等切身问题照顾很差。中南电业管理局征用万松园路土地时，接收了六个土地被征用的农民转业当工人。后来他们不用这块地了，却对已经接收下来的农民也推出不管了！有些干部不去摸清或解决个别拆迁户的思想情况和特殊困难，而简单生硬地采取“重点教育顽固分子”的办法，让他们在群众面前“检讨”。这种做法显然是十分错误的。
    目前，武汉市还有少数拆迁户没有被很好地安置，而几个新的基本建设工程就要开工了，又有近五千户居民要搬家。因此，切实地吸取以往的教训，慎重而周密地处理征用土地和妥善而及时地安排拆迁户的居住、职业和生活等问题，是急不容缓的事。　林双尔
