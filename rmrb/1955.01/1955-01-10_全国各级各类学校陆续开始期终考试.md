    National schools at all levels and of all types have progressively begun end-of-term exams.
    This year, higher education institutions in various regions have more universally adopted new examination methods. According to the "Regulations on Course Examinations and Assessments for Higher Education Institutions" promulgated by the Ministry of Higher Education, most schools have implemented oral exams, requiring students to systematically review the subjects learned this semester during the examination period and consolidate their learning outcomes. According to the provisions of various teaching plans, higher education institutions have allocated three to four weeks for exam review time. Teachers in schools across various regions have been mobilized to guide students in their review, and many higher education institutions have provided specific tutoring for worker and peasant students. Many primary and secondary school teachers have also formulated plans to help students review based on the teaching plan outlines and the students' actual situations. During the review and examination period, schools in various regions have also stipulated review, examination, and rest times, improved meals and other living arrangements, and prevented the examination from affecting students' physical health.

    全国各级各类学校已陆续开始期终考试。
    今年各地高等学校更加普遍地采取了新的考试方法，根据高等教育部颁布的“高等学校课程考试与考查规程”，多数学校实行了口试，要求学生在考试期间系统地复习这学期所学的功课，巩固学习成果。高等学校根据各类教学计划的规定，考试复习时间为三周到四周。各地学校的教师都已动员起来指导学生复习，许多高等学校还特别对工农学生进行具体辅导。许多中小学教师也根据授课计划纲要和学生实际情况，制定了帮助学生复习的计划。在复习考试期间，各地学校还规定了复习考试和休息时间，改善伙食和其他生活工作，防止因考试而影响学生的身体健康。  （新华社）
