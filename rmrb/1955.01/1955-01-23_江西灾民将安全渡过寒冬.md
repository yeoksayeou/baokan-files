Since the beginning of winter, Jiangxi Province has achieved great success in disaster relief work. According to preliminary statistics from eighteen severely affected counties and cities across the province, by the end of last December, they had helped disaster victims repair more than 63,000 houses and over 57,000 rooms, accounting for about 75 percent of the houses that collapsed due to the disaster. Furthermore, they allocated more than 88 billion yuan in relief funds to promptly solve the food shortage problems for over one million disaster victims. To address the issue of winter clothing for disaster victims, ten severely affected counties and cities have distributed more than 33,000 pieces of winter clothing. More than 15,000 pieces were distributed by the end of last December, basically resolving the problem of cold and freezing for disaster victims. Health departments at all levels also organized more than 1,000 Chinese and Western medicine practitioners to go deep into the disaster areas to carry out prevention and treatment work. According to preliminary statistics, they have treated more than 42,000 people, of whom 80 percent received free medical care. Due to the unparalleled care of the People's Government, disaster victims can safely survive the winter. Therefore, disaster victims gratefully say: "The People's Government is even better than our parents. In the future, we must work hard to restore production and support the country's industrial construction." (Yang Tu)

    江西灾民将安全渡过寒冬
    入冬以来，江西省救灾工作获得很大成绩。据全省十八个重灾县市的初步统计，到去年十二月底，已帮助灾民修复了房屋六万三千多栋又五万七千多间，约占受灾倒塌数的百分之七十五；并且还拨出救济款八百八十多亿元，及时解决了一百余万灾民缺粮困难。为了解决灾民的寒衣问题，有十个重灾县市已发放了三万三千多件寒衣。去年十二月底即发放了一万五千多件，基本上解决了灾民寒冻困难；各级卫生部门并组织了一千余名中西医师深入灾区进行预防和治疗工作，据初步统计，已诊治了四万二千多人次，其中有百分之八十得到免费医疗。由于人民政府这种无比亲切的关怀，灾民都能安全渡过寒冬，因此，灾民都感激地说：“人民政府比爹娘还好，今后一定要好好地恢复生产，支援国家工业建设。”（杨途）
