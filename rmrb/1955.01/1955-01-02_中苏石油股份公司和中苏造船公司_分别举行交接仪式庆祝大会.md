Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, December 31st: A grand handover ceremony and celebration meeting for the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company was held in Urumqi this afternoon. Attendees included Chen Yu, Minister of Fuel Industry of the People's Republic of China; Kang Shi'en, Director of the Petroleum Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry; Wang Enmao, First Secretary of the Xinjiang Branch of the CPC Central Committee; Saifudin, Fourth Secretary; Gao Jinchun, Vice Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government; Kazansky, Soviet Consul General in Urumqi; Ma Zai, General Manager of the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company; Boboven, Deputy General Manager; employees from both the Chinese and Soviet sides; Lai Jifa, Vice Minister of Heavy Industry of the People's Republic of China; Yang Zhengmin, Director of the Yumen Mining Bureau; and representatives from other units, totaling more than 800 people.

At the celebration meeting, the shareholders' representatives from both the Chinese and Soviet sides of the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company read out the decisions of the special shareholders' meeting in both Chinese and Russian, regarding the termination of the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company's business activities from January 1, 1955, and the transfer of the company's business management and all assets to the Xinjiang Petroleum Company.

Subsequently, Ma Zai, General Manager of the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company, and Boboven, Deputy General Manager, delivered speeches. In his speech, Ma Zai described the great achievements made by the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company in all aspects over the past four years, as well as the selfless labor and lofty internationalist spirit of the Soviet experts. He called on all employees to learn from the Soviet experts with an open mind in order to successfully complete the glorious tasks assigned by the state. In his speech, Boboven said: Over the past four years, thanks to the joint and fruitful labor of Chinese and Soviet comrades, the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company has successfully completed the task of creating the necessary conditions for establishing and further developing the petroleum industry in Xinjiang. What was originally a very small oilfield and a refinery with extremely low production capacity has now become a large-scale petroleum industrial complex. We have made great efforts in helping Chinese comrades master geological exploration, drilling, oil extraction, and refining technologies in the past, and the Soviet experts who remain here will definitely pass on their experience and knowledge to Chinese comrades without reservation.

In his speech, Chen Yu expressed gratitude to the Soviet government and the Soviet people for their lofty friendship and great selfless assistance. He said: Thanks to the outstanding work of Soviet experts and their unreserved transmission of advanced Soviet experience, overcoming various difficulties, this petroleum enterprise with advanced technology and a sound organizational management system was quickly established, which is of great significance for the development of our country's petroleum industry. Over the past four years, the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company has completed all geological exploration work within the designated scope, and has created new Chinese records in complex geological structures, including a daily progress of 231.4 meters and the completion of the deepest exploratory well of more than 2,800 meters. More importantly, Soviet experts have trained nearly 3,000 cadres and workers of various nationalities in just four years. These great achievements have laid a good foundation for further large-scale exploration and development of production in Xinjiang in the future. I sincerely hope that all employees of the company will earnestly and diligently learn from the Soviet Union and strive to build Xinjiang's petroleum base.

Saifudin, on behalf of the Xinjiang Branch of the CPC Central Committee, congratulated the meeting. He said: The great achievements made by the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company in the past short period have played a significant role in Xinjiang's construction of socialist industry and development of the national economy. We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet government and the Soviet people for this great assistance.

Kazansky, the Soviet Consul General in Urumqi, said in his speech: The transfer of Soviet shares in various joint-stock companies to the People's Republic of China after negotiations between the Chinese and Soviet governments is a further development of the great friendship between our two peoples. The Soviet people wish the united and friendly Chinese people new achievements in realizing the country's socialist industrialization plan, in developing agriculture, in further improving the people's welfare, and in jointly consolidating their people's democratic state.

At this point, Chen Yu announced to the meeting the decision of the Ministry of Fuel Industry regarding the renaming of the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company and the appointment of personnel, as well as the decision to build a memorial hall. Chen Yu also presented memorial medals and memorial medal certificates to all Soviet experts on behalf of the Ministry of Fuel Industry.

A grand banquet was held after the meeting.

Yuan Xianqian, Deputy General Manager of the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company, said in his speech: Under the care of the governments of China and the Soviet Union and with the direct assistance of Soviet experts, the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company, in the course of three years, has applied the principles of Soviet socialist enterprise management, trained a considerable number of Chinese cadres, and carried out expansion and renovation projects.

He said: The Soviet government has invested a large amount of capital in the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company and sent a large number of experienced and technically proficient personnel, which has rectified the factory in a short period of time, greatly improved its production capacity, changed its past dilapidated and backward state, and made it a model in the new China's shipbuilding industry. Now the Soviet government has transferred all Soviet shares to China. This spirit of internationalism and concern and assistance for our country's socialist construction is worthy of our eternal remembrance. This was followed by a speech by Tichkov, the Soviet shareholder representative, who said: The transfer of Soviet shares will promote the further prosperity of our two great countries, promote the further development of the great friendship between the Soviet Union and China, and promote the further consolidation of the socialist camp of peace and democracy.
