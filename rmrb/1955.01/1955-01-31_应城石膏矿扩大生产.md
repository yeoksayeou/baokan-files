    Yingcheng Gypsum Mine Expands Production
    The nationally famous Yingcheng Gypsum Mine in Hubei Province will produce one-third more gypsum this year than last year to meet the needs of agricultural production and industrial raw materials.
    According to statistics, the daily gypsum production of Hubei Yingcheng Gypsum Mine can supply more than 70,000 mu of farmland as fertilizer, or can be used as raw material for more than 13,000 tons of cement. Because the gypsum produced here is of excellent quality, more than 20 provinces and cities across the country have ordered gypsum from Yingcheng Gypsum Mine.
    To complete this year's production tasks, ten rock cutting machines, fifteen electric trolleys, and more than ten hand drills and electric drills will be put into production at Yingcheng Gypsum Mine; at the same time, the main underground roadways will be widened and double tracks laid, and the underground ventilation will be increased. In this way, Yingcheng Gypsum Mine can basically end manual production by the end of this year. In order to expand the production of gypsum, the state has decided to build a new mine here. Last year, the drilling team discovered translucent crystals of gypsum at 145 meters and 160 meters underground, proving that the quality of the gypsum here is excellent, and the thickest gypsum layer is about 19 centimeters, which has economic value for mining. The basic construction of the new mine is planned to start in the second quarter of this year and can be put into production in 1957; by 1958, Yingcheng Gypsum Mine can produce twice as much gypsum as this year.

    应城石膏矿扩大生产
    全国著名的湖北应城石膏矿，今年将要生产比去年多三分之一的石膏，来满足农业生产和工业原料的需要。
    根据统计，湖北应城石膏矿现在每日生产的石膏，可以供给七万多亩农田作为肥料，或者可以作为一万三千多吨水泥用的原料。因为这里出产的石膏品质优良，目前，全国已经有二十多个省和市向应城石膏矿订购了石膏。
    为完成今年的生产任务，应城石膏矿将有十部割岩机、十五部电动滑车、十多部手摇钻和电钻先后投入生产；同时，还要加宽井下主要巷道并铺设双轨，加大井下通风力量。这样，应城石膏矿到今年年底，就可以基本上结束手工生产了。为了扩大石膏的生产，国家已经决定要在这里开建新矿。去年钻探队在地下一百四十五公尺和一百六十公尺的地方发现了石膏的透晶体，证明这里石膏的质量优良，最厚的石膏层有十九公分左右，具有开采的经济价值。新矿的基本建设，计划在今年第二季度开始施工，在一九五七年就可投入生产；到了一九五八年，应城石膏矿就可以生产相当于今年两倍的石膏了。　（纪卓如）
