    Cannot Allow West German Militarism to Revive
    ——The Rising Struggle of the Broad Masses in Europe and the Americas
    National Front of Democratic Germany Issues Appeal
    The German News Agency reported: The West German Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany issued an appeal to West German residents, calling on them to fight against the ratification of the Paris Accords.
  The appeal pointed out that if workers and residents of other classes declared their refusal to ratify the Paris Accords, the Paris Accords would not be ratified. If we can defeat the Paris Accords through common struggle, we will have eliminated the biggest obstacle to reunifying Germany under conditions of peace and freedom and based on principles guaranteeing security and social progress.
    The appeal said: The German people do not want the Paris Accords; the German people demand negotiations between West and East Germany, "Only in this way can we lead to a peaceful resolution of the German question, hold free and democratic all-German elections this year, and establish an all-German government."
    West German Patriots Launch Various Struggles
    West German patriots are stepping up their struggle against the revival of German militarism in response to the Bonn militarists and revanchists' attempts to hastily ratify the Paris Accords. Since the "Week of Struggle" against the Paris Accords began in West Germany on January 10, the Essen City Committee of the German Communist Party organized a mass meeting against the Paris Accords and the interrogation of the German Communist Party, with attendees signing petitions against the revival of West German militarism. In Solingen and other cities, numerous mass meetings organized by the German Communist Party were also held, calling on the West German people to rise up against the rearmament of West Germany.
    In Bremerhaven, a mass meeting attended by Social Democrats, Communists, and non-party workers was held, and the meeting passed a resolution demanding that all members of the Bonn Federal Parliament oppose the ratification of the Paris Accords during the second reading debate. In Nuremberg, 250 Communist, Social Democratic, and non-party metalworkers gathered to demand immediate action to stop the ratification of the Paris Accords. Dockworkers in Hamburg held a rally against the Paris Accords.
    The Stuttgart City Committee of the German Social Democratic Party passed a resolution demanding that the Social Democratic parliamentary group push for a popular vote in West Germany on the Paris Accords and the Saar issue.
    Workers at the "Vogelsang Company" in Bielefeld passed a resolution protesting against West German re-militarization and demanding measures for the peaceful reunification of Germany. Members of the production committee of the Novitz "Raschelden Company," on behalf of all workers, sent a letter to Bonn parliamentarians, asking them to reject the Paris Accords in the interest of maintaining peace and peacefully reunifying Germany. The local organization of the Freiburg Metalworkers' Union sent representatives to the Baden-Württemberg state trade union delegate meeting and instructed them to oppose the re-militarization of West Germany.
    Most West German Youth Oppose Rearmament
    The West German "Hamburger Morgenpost" published the results of a recent survey conducted by the newspaper on the issue of rearming West Germany. Among the youth surveyed, 60.7 percent were fundamentally opposed to establishing a West German army, 26.2 percent had no opinion, and only 13.1 percent indicated that they were not fundamentally opposed to conscription. Regarding the potential consequences of rearmament, 58.5 percent of young people believed that establishing a West German army would increase the threat of war; 64.7 percent emphasized that establishing a West German army would increase the difficulty of restoring Germany's unity.
    Four and a Half Million Signatures in France Against
    Since the French National Assembly passed the Paris Accords by a slim majority under unprecedented pressure from the United States and Britain, the French people have intensified their struggle against the rearmament of West Germany.
    According to a statement issued by the French National Peace Council on the 12th, another one million French men and women have signed petitions against the revival of German militarism in the past 20 days. This number brings the total number of people who have signed against the rearmament of West Germany to more than four and a half million to date.
    U.S. "Daily Worker" Calls for Intensified Struggle
    The New York "Daily Worker" recently published an editorial calling on the American people to fight against the ratification of the Paris Accords.
    The editorial said: The French National Assembly, under the crude pressure of Washington and London, has approved the Paris Accords by a slim majority, which deepens the threat of German militarism. The editorial said: This threat is not only directed at France, but also at the United States. Because the Eisenhower administration's mad policy of rearming West Germany not only threatens the interests of the European people but also threatens the national interests of the United States.
    The editorial said that now that the European people have more resolutely strengthened their struggle against the re-militarization of West Germany, every American patriot should also take action to fight against the ratification of the Paris Accords to arm West Germany.
    Dean of Canterbury Issues Appeal
    Dr. Hewlett Johnson, President of the British-Soviet Friendship Society and Dean of Canterbury, wrote to 7,000 organizations and individuals, discussing the issue of West German rearmament and the Anglo-Soviet Treaty.
    Johnson said: "Although there have been some improvements in the international situation in 1954, the dawn of 1955 is shrouded in the threat of rearming German militarism. The rearmament of German militarism poses an unspeakable danger to both Western European and Eastern countries alike."
    Dean Johnson spoke of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty, saying that it is now in danger. He also said that the possibility of reaching an agreement between East and West has not been fully exploited. Johnson pointed out: "As long as there is a glimmer of hope for reaching an agreement through further negotiations, embarking on the rearmament of West Germany is the worst possible political gamble."
    Danish Public Demands Referendum
    Danish public organizations have issued statements demanding a referendum on the Paris Accords before Parliament passes a resolution on the Paris Accords regarding the revival of German militarism.
    In a protest letter against the re-militarization of West Germany, Danish student organizations pointed out that, given the threat posed by German militarism, Danish students believe that a referendum should be held on the issue of ratifying the agreement that re-militarizes West Germany.
    The trade union leader of the Bemster Owe shipyard issued an appeal to all trade union members in Copenhagen, asking them to join him in demanding a referendum on the Paris Accords.
    The magazine "Free Denmark," issued by personnel from the bourgeois faction of the former resistance movement, devoted almost the entire issue to publishing articles exposing the conspiracy to arm West Germany. The magazine called on the Danish people to demand a referendum on Denmark's attitude towards arming West Germany.
    The pacifist organization "Never Again War" Standing Committee also issued a statement demanding that the government and the Lower House hold a national referendum before passing any resolutions on the Paris Accords. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    不能容许西德军国主义复活
    ——欧洲、美洲广大群众的斗争日益加强
    民主德国全国阵线发表呼吁书
    德意志通讯社报道：民主德国全国阵线西德委员会发表告西德居民的呼吁书，号召他们为反对批准巴黎协定而斗争。
  呼吁书指出，如果工人们和其他阶层的居民宣布拒绝巴黎协定，巴黎协定就不会得到批准。如果我们能以共同的斗争击败巴黎协定，我们就是为在和平、自由的条件下和根据保证安全和社会进步的原则重新统一德国排除了最大的障碍。
    呼吁书说：德国人民不要巴黎协定，德国人民要求西德和东德进行谈判，“只有这样，才能导向德国问题的和平解决，才能在今年举行自由、民主的全德选举，才能建立一个全德政府。”
    西德爱国人士展开各种斗争活动
    西德爱国人士正在加强反对复活德国军国主义的斗争，来回击波恩军国主义者和复仇主义者企图急忙批准巴黎协定的行动。自从一月十日在西德开始举行反对巴黎协定的“斗争周”以来，德国共产党埃森市委员会组织了一次反对巴黎协定和反对审讯德国共产党的群众大会，到会群众纷纷签名反对复活西德军国主义。在索林根和其他城市，也举行了多次由德国共产党组织的群众大会，号召西德人民起来反对重新武装西德。
    在不来梅港，举行了社会民主党、共产党和无党派的工人共同参加的群众大会，大会通过了决议，要求波恩联邦议院全体议员在二读辩论巴黎协定时反对批准巴黎协定。在纽伦堡，二百五十名共产党、社会民主党和无党派的五金工人共同集会要求立即采取行动，制止批准巴黎协定。汉堡的码头工人举行了反对巴黎协定的集会。
    德国社会民主党斯图加特市委员会通过了决议，要求社会民主党议会党团促成在西德就巴黎协定和萨尔问题举行一次人民投票。
    俾雷腓尔德“佛格尔藏格公司”的工人集会通过了一项决议，抗议西德重新军国主义化，要求采取和平统一德国的措施。诺维茨“拉谢尔登公司”的生产委员会委员们代表全体工人寄给波恩议员们一封信，要求他们为维护和平和和平统一德国的利益而拒绝巴黎协定。夫赖堡五金工人工会地方组织派遣了代表出席巴登—瓦登堡州工会代表会议，并责成他们反对西德重新军国主义化。
    西德大部分青年反对重新武装
    西德“汉堡晨邮报”发表了该报最近举行的一次关于重新武装西德问题的测验结果。在被调查的青年中，有百分之六十点七的人根本反对建立西德军队，百分之二十六点二的人没有意见，只有百分之十三点一的人表示并不是根本反对兵役制。在关于重新武装可能引起的后果的问题上，有百分之五十八点五的青年认为：建立西德军队将增加战争的威胁；有百分之六十四点七的人强调：建立西德军队将增加使德国恢复统一的困难。
    法国四百五十万人签名反对
    自从法国国民议会在美国和英国的空前压力下以微弱多数通过巴黎协定后，法国人民更加加紧了反对重新武装西德的斗争。
    据法国全国和平理事会十二日发表的声明说，在过去二十天中，又有一百万法国男女在反对复活德国军国主义的请愿书上签名。这个数字使截至目前为止签名反对重新武装西德的人数达到四百五十万人以上。
    美国“工人日报”号召加强斗争
    纽约“工人日报”最近发表社论，号召美国人民为反对批准巴黎协定而斗争。
    社论说：法国国民议会在华盛顿和伦敦的粗暴压力下已经以微弱多数批准了巴黎协定，这就加深了德国军国主义的威胁。社论说：这种威胁不但是针对着法国，而且也是针对着美国的。因为艾森豪威尔政府推行的重新武装西德的疯狂政策不但威胁着欧洲人民的利益，而且也威胁着美国的民族利益。
    社论说，现在，欧洲人民已经更加坚决地加强了他们反对西德重新军国主义化的斗争，美国每一个爱国者也应该行动起来，为反对批准武装西德的巴黎协定而斗争。
    英国坎特伯雷教长发出呼吁
    英苏友好协会会长、坎特伯雷教长休勒特·约翰逊博士写信给七千个组织和个人，谈到关于西德重新武装问题和英苏条约问题。
    约翰逊说：“虽然在一九五四年国际局势有了一些改善，但是一九五五年的黎明却被重新武装德国军国主义的威胁笼罩着。德国军国主义的重新武装，对于西欧和东方国家有着同样不可言喻的危险。”
    约翰逊教长谈到英苏条约，他说，这个条约现在已经处于危险之中。他并说：东西方达成协议的可能性并没有被充分利用。约翰逊指出：“只要存在着通过进一步谈判达成协议的一线希望，着手重新武装西德就是最糟不过的政治冒险。”
    丹麦公众要求举行公民投票
    丹麦公众组织纷纷发表声明，要求在议会就复活德国军国主义的巴黎协定通过决议之前，举行关于巴黎协定的公民投票。
    丹麦的学生组织在反对西德重新军国主义化的抗议书中指出：鉴于德国军国主义引起的威胁，丹麦学生认为应该就批准使西德重新军国主义化的协定的问题举行公民投票。
    倍姆斯特奥威造船厂的工会领袖向哥本哈根全体工会会员发出呼吁，要工会会员同他们一起要求举行关于巴黎协定的公民投票。
    由前抵抗运动资产阶级派的人员发行的杂志“自由丹麦”在一月号几乎以全部篇幅刊载了揭露武装西德的阴谋的文章。这家杂志号召丹麦人民要求就丹麦对武装西德的态度进行一次公民投票。
    和平主义的“再也不要战争”组织常务委员会也发表声明，要求政府和下议院在就巴黎协定通过任何决议以前举行全国公民投票。（据新华社讯）
