    Must Improve the Quality of Investigative Work
    Cheng Jinwu
    In order to study and solve problems in our work, we must conduct systematic and thorough investigations and research, understand the specific circumstances of all aspects, conduct meticulous and in-depth analysis, identify the internal connections of things, and summarize practical conclusions, thereby determining policies and proposing methods and steps to solve problems and improve work. This is a pragmatic work style and method based on dialectical materialism and historical materialism. In 1941, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China specifically issued a "Decision on Investigation and Research." In this decision and in Comrade Mao Zedong's works such as "Reform Our Study," "Oppose Stereotyped Party Writing," and "Preface and Postscript to ‘Rural Survey’," the importance of investigation and research was repeatedly pointed out, stating that "there is no right to speak without investigation," and severely criticizing crude and careless work styles, lack of thorough understanding, self-righteousness, subjectivism, and formalism. During the "Rectification of Three Styles" movement, special attention was paid to educating cadres to value investigation work and to develop a pragmatic work style. From this, we can see how much the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong valued investigation work, regarding it not only as a general issue of work style but also as an issue of the Party spirit of a Communist Party member.
    Since the "Rectification of Three Styles" movement, Party and government organs at all levels have generally paid more attention to investigation and research. Some have even established special institutions to conduct investigation and research. Currently, almost every leading organ conducts many investigation works every quarter and every month. After the "New Three-Anti" movement, the number of investigation personnel dispatched has obviously increased greatly. However, we cannot assume that there are no more problems in this area. In reality, many work units still do not pay enough attention to investigation work. Some cadres (especially leading cadres) are often busy attending lengthy and inefficient meetings and are trapped in tedious paperwork, unable to break free from the circle of事務主義 and delve into important issues in their work at the grassroots level, instead locking themselves in small offices and meeting rooms. Some institutions are only a few kilometers away from the leading organs, yet the leading organs may not send anyone down to understand the situation for months or even years. As a result, leading organs, due to a lack of understanding or a superficial understanding of the situation at the grassroots level, issue commands based on subjective speculation or one-sided materials, which often leads to serious losses in work. Therefore, we must not be satisfied with generally acknowledging the importance of investigation work, but should regard doing a good job in investigation work as a serious struggle against subjectivism and bureaucratism, and truly place investigation work in the most important position in the entire work, combining it with the implementation of work plans, and seriously organizing forces to conduct systematic and in-depth investigation and research.
    Investigation and research are originally powerful weapons to overcome bureaucratism and formalism, but if done poorly, they themselves can also generate bureaucratism and formalism. Investigations lacking a clear purpose, investigations with poorly planned, investigations with incorrect methods often spend a lot of time and exhaust many cadres and the masses, but do not receive much practical effect. There is a reason why the investigated units regard this kind of investigation, that is "laboring the people and wasting money" without actual help to the work as a terrible extra burden. What is more serious is that because the investigation work is not done well, the situation reflected is not comprehensive or correct, but the leadership relies on this unreliable investigation material to solve the problem, which will inevitably cause serious errors. This is something that deserves special vigilance. Therefore, not only should we value investigation and research, but we must also seriously adopt specific measures to improve the quality of investigation work, so that each investigation work can achieve its due effect.
    Clarifying the purpose and tasks of investigation work is a prerequisite for doing a good job in investigation work. At the beginning of investigation work, we must first clarify what problems need to be solved in this investigation work? What aspects of materials need to be mastered, and what aspects of problems need to be researched to complete the task of investigation work. After clarifying the purpose and tasks of investigation, determining the scope of investigation, organizing investigation forces, selecting investigation objects, considering investigation methods, and formulating investigation plans will have a basis. It is always more difficult to do investigation work with scattered goals, too many tasks, and too broad a scope. It is best to have a clear purpose, a prominent center, and a concentrated task, so that investigation work can be easily done thoroughly and deeply.
    The strength of cadres is decisive for the quality of investigation work. Stronger cadres must be assigned according to the purpose and tasks of the investigation to form an investigation team that is capable of doing the job. When assigning investigation cadres, political conditions, theoretical level, professional ability, and work experience must be considered. The most important point is that each investigation team must have a team leader with a higher level in all aspects and a certain number of strong backbones who can work independently. Therefore, it is essential for leading comrades and capable cadres of the organs to participate in investigation work. General team members should also have a certain level of political and professional skills, but a small number of cadres with lower levels and less experience can also be assigned to be trained in their work. The investigation team can be organized independently by one unit or jointly by several related units with one unit as the main organizer. Although joint investigation teams have some shortcomings, as long as the purpose and requirements of the investigation are basically the same, there are many advantages: first, more cadres can be concentrated to enhance the investigation force; second, cadres from different units see problems from different angles, and the combination is more comprehensive; third, it is easier for several units to reach a consensus in the future on coordinating research issues and improving work. Sometimes, the leading organs temporarily transfer cadres or technicians from related institutions to inspect the work of other institutions with the same nature. This is not only very helpful for investigation and research but also greatly improves the thinking and abilities of these participating cadres and is an effective method for improving cadres. The investigation team must have a strict organization, a clear division of labor, and necessary disciplinary systems to prevent the occurrence of departmentalism and liberalism that disregard the overall interest, so that the investigation team becomes a solid fighting unit with consistent steps. This is especially necessary for larger joint investigation teams composed of several units. However, without hindering the entire investigation work, the work experience and requirements of the team members should also be appropriately taken into account.
    The investigation team should do various preparations before departure. First of all, make a practical and feasible investigation plan, and make proper arrangements for the key points, steps, and methods of the investigation work according to the purpose and requirements of the investigation; an investigation outline should be written for the issues to be understood and studied; in this way, they will not lose their way in the investigation work. It is best to send the investigation plan and investigation outline to the investigated unit and related parties before departure so that they have sufficient time to prepare. Secondly, the policies related to each investigation work should be further studied. Only after mastering the policies can the direction be correctly determined and right and wrong can be distinguished, the analysis of problems will have a reliable standard, and the implementation of policies and the correctness of the policies themselves can be examined. Therefore, before the investigation team departs, the leadership should explain the policies in detail, and the comrades participating in the investigation work should read relevant documents and conduct research and discussion, striving to master the policies, and should carry the necessary relevant documents for reference when they depart. Thirdly, the existing materials of the investigated unit on the issues to be investigated should be mastered in advance as the basis for the investigation work. The investigation team should read and study the existing statistical figures, cadre situation, work reports, work summaries, etc. before departure. In order to fully prepare, the comrades participating in the investigation work should be relieved of their original work for a period of time before departure (the length of time depends on the need) so that they have ample time to prepare. If there is no time guarantee, the preparation work will fall through.
    Comrades doing investigation work must have a humble attitude and a hard-working and simple style, and humbly listen to other people's opinions. They must avoid being arrogant, casually criticizing, and lightly drawing conclusions after learning a little about the situation. The investigation team sent by the superior leading organ should pay special attention to this point. The investigation team should make all arrangements based on whether it is convenient for the investigation work. For example, the living conditions of the factory may not be as good as those of the local Party and government organs, but in order to facilitate the investigation, they should resolutely live in the factory; when going to the countryside, if there is a lack of transportation, they should walk, and should maintain a hard-working and simple style in life and action. Some comrades doing investigation work are very particular about eating, housing, and taking the car. This not only hinders the investigation work but also creates a bad influence among the masses.
    The investigation team must cooperate closely with the investigated unit to successfully complete the task. Whether it is the investigating party or the investigated party, the purpose is to clarify the situation, study and solve problems, so as to improve work. The investigation team can invite cadres from the investigated unit to participate in the investigation work, and the investigated unit also has the responsibility to help the investigation team to clarify the situation. However, some investigation teams are not good at adopting a comradely attitude to discuss issues with the investigated unit and strive for the cooperation of the investigated unit, and are nitpicking everywhere, making the investigated unit feel pressured, so the investigated unit takes a coping and defensive attitude everywhere. In this case, it is not easy to clarify the true situation, and it is not easy for both parties to reach a consensus, so the role played by the investigation work is often weak. On the other hand, sometimes, because the investigation work involves errors in the work of the investigated unit or other reasons, the investigated unit takes an incorrect attitude towards the investigation work, so the investigation work may be resisted and blocked. Although this situation is not common, comrades doing investigation work should also be wary of it.
    Investigation work must rely on the Party, rely on the government, and rely on the masses. The local Party committee has the responsibility to guarantee and supervise all aspects of the work, often considers issues from political principles, grasps the cadre situation, and sees problems more comprehensively; the Party organizations of the institutions are responsible for ensuring the completion of administrative tasks (factory Party organizations must also supervise production), and have close ties with the masses, and can generally provide reliable materials. Therefore, the investigation team must obtain the guidance and assistance of the local Party committee and the Party organization of the investigated institution. The various government administrative departments are the competent authorities for various undertakings (such as the industrial administrative department for factories, the health administrative department for hospitals, etc.), and they have a relatively clear understanding of the situation and problems of the institutions they are in charge of. They also have the responsibility to help the investigation team to clarify the situation to be understood, so the investigation team must obtain their cooperation and assistance, ask them to provide materials, and even send cadres to cooperate in the investigation. More importantly, investigate the masses. Some investigation teams are satisfied with understanding the situation from the local Party committee and the government, but do not go deep into the scene to investigate the masses. The materials obtained are often second-hand, and the view of the problem only has the leadership side, lacking the mass side, which is often not profound or comprehensive. Therefore, the investigation task cannot be well completed. Therefore, the investigation team must go deep into factories, rural areas, schools, hospitals... etc., to investigate cadres who do practical work, and to investigate the basic masses. Cadres and workers, peasants, teachers, students, doctors, etc. who do practical work understand the situation truly. Although they can sometimes only provide unsystematic raw materials and simple and unadorned opinions, these materials and opinions often contain important plots and objective truths. The investigation team can get strong inspiration and conclusive basis from here as a solid foundation for research and problem-solving. Therefore, the investigation team must go deep into the masses, appropriately organize various investigation meetings, forums, and conduct individual interviews, and listen more to the opinions of cadres and basic masses who do practical work.
    Every aspect of work has a certain institution, such as factories and mines for industry, and schools for education; each institution has its own basic work unit, such as workshops for factories, companies for troops, classes for middle and primary schools, and departments (sections) for teaching administration and teaching and research offices for teaching work in colleges and universities. To investigate the work of a certain aspect, it is necessary to go deep into one or two institutions; to investigate the situation of an institution, it is necessary to go deep into one or two basic work units as the focus of the investigation work, concentrate manpower, and use sufficient time to conduct detailed and thorough investigations, avoiding the average use of force. However, the non-key units should also be appropriately understood in general, combining points and surfaces, comparing and studying each other, so that the investigation work is both in-depth and comprehensive.
    The investigation team must grasp the situation comprehensively and correctly in order to lay a good foundation for the entire investigation work. To achieve this, materials need to be collected from all aspects, such as leadership and masses, internal and external. Due to the different positions of all parties and individuals, the different contact surfaces of work, and the different perspectives of viewing problems, the materials and opinions provided will not be exactly the same or even completely different. These materials and opinions can complement each other, corroborate each other, and promote each other. After the investigation team has mastered the materials of all parties, they see the commonalities and similarities, and also see the differences and contradictions; after analysis and synthesis, they can see the whole picture of things and the essence of the problem. The saying "Listen to both sides and you will be enlightened, listen to one side and you will be in the dark" makes a lot of sense, and it is very dangerous to listen to one side and believe it. Therefore, the investigation team should investigate the Party and government leading organs, investigate mass organizations such as trade unions and the Communist Youth League, investigate cadres who do practical work, and even investigate the basic masses; they can understand the internal work of an institution from external investigations, and also understand the situation of the higher-level leadership and the work of relevant departments from the institution. During the investigation, existing statistical figures, work reports, work summaries and other written materials can be collected from the investigated unit, so that you can understand some basic information and save a lot of time; at the same time, it can be compared with the current actual situation for research. It is of special significance to visit or participate in various practical work and specific activities (work, meetings, production, learning, recreation... etc.) of the investigated unit during the investigation. The true situation can be best seen from the lively movement of things, and fresh things and important problems can be discovered.
    The materials obtained by the investigation team must be practical and reliable. Therefore, what is the political and ideological situation of the person providing the materials? How is the spirit of seeking truth from facts in dealing with things? What is the position and interest relationship in the work? Is it personally participated and seen with one's own eyes or hearsay? Is it an expert or a layman in this aspect of work? etc. should be clarified. For important materials, it is necessary to ask to the bottom of the matter and investigate and verify from all aspects without fear of trouble until it is completely clarified. For the time, location, names, numbers, evidence, important facts, etc., after clarifying, they should be recorded in detail. Some should also be photographed or collected physical objects as examples.
    Be good at discovering shortcomings and problems in the work, and also be good at discovering achievements and experiences in the work. The investigation team can discover shortcomings and errors in the work, point out where the problems lie, and propose solutions to improve the work. This is one aspect of the results that the investigation team must seek. However, the work of some investigation teams often focuses on this aspect, while paying little attention to studying the achievements and advantages in the work. Some investigation teams have completed an investigation of a certain undertaking in a large area, and they cannot see any achievements and experiences in the long investigation report of tens of thousands of words, which is obviously wrong. In fact, even in units where the work is done very poorly, individual achievements and advantages can still be found. Therefore, the investigation team must have a keen sense of new things in the work, be good at discovering new things, even if they are still in the budding state; they should be particularly interested in innovators and advanced working methods, and even the smallest experiences and immature suggestions should be valued and cherished. It should be believed that many of our cadres and the broad masses of workers, peasants and other working people are working diligently year after year, constantly using their physical strength and wisdom, overcoming difficulties and making achievements under various different specific conditions; in the process of work, new work experiences and innovators of work will inevitably continue to emerge. One of the important tasks of the leading organ is to discover these experiences in a timely manner, study and summarize them, and promote them to improve the quality of work of all relevant units; discover advanced units and outstanding workers in work in a timely manner, and help and train them to become models and backbones in work. If we only pay attention to discovering shortcomings and errors in the investigation, and do not pay attention to discovering good experiences, advanced work units, and innovative people in the work, such investigation work can only be considered to have completed half of the task at most.
    "Investigation" and "research" must be closely combined. Collect materials on the one hand, and digest materials on the other hand. If you only care about collecting materials and neglect using the obtained materials to study and solve problems, you will become a slave to the materials or be buried in the sea of materials. Therefore, when the investigation team is conducting the investigation, it should analyze and study by means of reporting, chatting, discussion, etc. while investigating, to find clues to solve the problem. In the research, it will be found that some aspects of the material are insufficient, some facts have not been clarified, and some aspects have new situations worthy of attention, and new requirements are put forward for the investigation work. In particular, when the investigation team collects basic materials and the work is initially completed, it should spend more time to conduct a more comprehensive discussion and research. Then, on the basis of this stage of investigation and research, put forward several important questions, and further conduct detailed and in-depth investigations to gradually study the questions clearly. Therefore, in the process of investigation, the time for sorting out and researching materials and the time for exchanging opinions, chatting, and discussing within the investigation team must be appropriately arranged.
    The investigation report is a concentrated expression of the results of investigation and research, and this report must be well written. It is of the utmost importance for the investigation team to master rich and reliable materials, find the essence of the problem from the complicated phenomena, and use the obtained materials to explain and solve the problem. When writing the report, the view of the problem should be as comprehensive as possible, and the good, correct, and beneficial... aspects should be seen, as well as the bad, wrong, and unfavorable aspects; the degree of depth, the importance of the relationship, the size of the role, etc. of each aspect should be given appropriate estimates based on seeking truth from facts. If the sense of propriety is not grasped, it is easy to come to one-sided conclusions. We often see two types of investigation reports: one type lists many facts, but does not analyze them in depth, does not clearly put forward questions and explain the truth, and does not definitely state right and wrong; the other type raises questions and affirms what is right or wrong, but the questions raised and the conclusions made are generalized, such as "weak ideological leadership", "deviation in grasping policies"... etc.; as for how weak the ideological leadership is? Why is it weak? What are the consequences? etc. are not explained clearly. The former lists the facts, and the latter makes generalized abstract conclusions. Although the forms expressed by these two types of reports are different, the common shortcomings are that they have not been able to conduct specific analysis based on the specific situation. The investigation report must have solid factual basis, put forward specific questions, and find the internal connections of things from the specific analysis of facts. That is, to further study the questions based on the facts, under what specific conditions were they produced? What is the development situation? How does it affect all aspects? What is the nature? What are the characteristics? What is the root cause? Where is the key? ... After studying this series of questions clearly, put forward specific countermeasures to solve the problem. Such a report has sufficient factual basis, has in-depth analysis and research, explains the truth of right and wrong, discovers the crux of the problem, and puts forward specific ways to solve the problem, so that the investigation work can get the due results. The criticisms or suggestions put forward for the work should be objective and practical; at the same time, the wording must fully consider how these criticisms and suggestions can have the greatest positive impact on the current work, conform to the highest interests of the people, and avoid generating adverse side effects. It is obviously wrong to not stand firmly on the position of the working class and take an "objectivist" attitude, indiscriminately "reveal" all the situations and opinions. The investigation report should strive to be correct both factually and politically.
    Investigation reports should generally be written on the spot. There are many benefits to doing this: First, writing the investigation report is the most important task of the concluding stage, and completing an investigation from beginning to end; second, the investigation team's thoughts are concentrated on the issues to be investigated, and they have just obtained many materials, and the impression is very fresh, and it is more convenient to summarize it in a timely manner, so as not to let the matter pass and the thoughts become less concentrated, and the situation gradually becomes blurred; third, the investigation team is conducting investigations outside, and there is nothing else to distract them, so they can write the report in a relatively short time; otherwise, after returning to the organ, everyone may have urgent work to do, and it is not easy to concentrate forces to research and summarize. If the investigation is jointly organized by several units, and each returns to their own organ, it is also inconvenient to discuss issues, and the progress of the work will increase many difficulties, and it is easy to delay the time and lose the effectiveness; fourth, writing the report in the place where the investigation work is being carried out, it is also more convenient to add and verify if there are insufficient materials or unclear situations; after returning to the organ, it is much more troublesome to encounter this situation.
    Before the investigation team finishes its work and leaves the place where the investigation work is being carried out, it should generally exchange opinions with the responsible cadres of the investigated unit and the local Party and government leading organs. Although the investigation report has not been approved by the organ and the opinions and suggestions put forward are not official decisions, it is still beneficial to put forward the situation and preliminary opinions seen by the investigation team and talk with them. On the one hand, the comrades of the investigated unit generally hope to hear the opinions of the investigation team in order to study how to improve the work; on the other hand, the investigation team can also ask the comrades of the investigated unit to make certain corrections and supplements to the situation and opinions understood by the investigation team, and some questions can also be further discussed and studied together. In this way, the investigation report can be more perfect. The investigation team should be fully prepared for the content of the conversation and should take a research and consultation attitude to talk.
    After the investigation team returns to its own organ, the investigation report should be brought to relevant meetings for discussion, and according to the needs of the work, make some decisions to improve the work, and take specific measures as far as possible to make the investigation work produce direct or indirect practical effects. If it is considered that after the investigation report is written, everything is fine, and the investigation does not have any practical impact on the actual work, this kind of formalistic investigation is meaningless.
    After each investigation work is completed, the investigation team itself should also seriously summarize its work, so as to absorb the experience and lessons of each investigation work, so as to continuously improve the quality of investigation work.

    必须提高调查工作的质量
    程今吾
    为了研究和解决工作中的问题，经过系统周密的调查研究，了解各方面的具体情况，进行细致深入的分析，找出事物的内在联系，总结出切合实际的论断，从而确定方针政策，提出解决问题和改进工作的方法步骤。这是建立在辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义思想基础上的实事求是的工作作风和工作方法。中共中央在一九四一年曾专门作出“关于调查研究的决定”，在这一决定和毛泽东同志的“改造我们的学习”、“反对党八股”、“‘农村调查’的序言和跋”等著作里，都一再指出调查研究的重要，认为“没有调查就没有发言权”，严厉地批判了粗枝大叶，不求甚解，自以为是，主观主义形式主义等不良作风。在“整顿三风”运动当中，特别注意教育干部重视调查工作，养成实事求是的工作作风。从这里可以看到中国共产党和毛泽东同志对于调查工作是如何的重视，不只看作是一般的工作作风问题，而且看作是共产党员的党性问题。
      “整顿三风”运动以来，各级党、政机关等一般都比较注意调查研究，有的还设立了进行调查研究的专门机构，目前每一个领导机关几乎每季、每月都要作许多调查工作，“新三反”以后，派出调查人员的数字显然是大大的增加了。但是，不能因此就认为这一方面已经没有问题了，实际不少的工作单位对于调查工作的重视还是很不够的，有些干部（首先是领导干部）常常忙于参加冗长而缺少效率的会议和陷身于繁琐的文牍丛中而不能自拔，不善于跳出事务主义的圈子，抓住工作中的重要问题深入下层进行钻研，而把自己封锁在狭小的办公室和会议室里。有些事业单位距离领导机关不过几公里，而领导机关竟可以几个月或整年不派人下去了解情况。因此，领导机关由于不了解下情或了解得不深不透，凭着主观臆测或片面材料发号司令，以 致使工作受到严重损失的情况，还是常常发生的。所以，我们决不能满足于一般化地承认调查工作的重要，而应该把做好调查工作看作是反对主观主义、官僚主义的严重斗争，实实在在地把调查工作放在整个工作最重要的位置上来考虑，结合着工作计划的执行，认真地组织力量，系统而深入地进行调查研究。
    调查研究原是克服官僚主义形式主义的有力武器，但如果做得不好，其本身也会产生官僚主义形式主义。缺乏明确目的的调查、计划不周到的调查、方法不正确的调查，往往花费许多时间，劳累许多干部和群众，却收不到多少实际效果。被调查单位把这种“劳民伤财”对工作缺少实际帮助的调查看成可怕的额外负担，不是没有理由的。更严重的是：由于调查工作没有做好，反映上来的情况不全面不正确，领导上却依靠这种不可靠的调查材料来解决问题，也就不可避免地造成严重错误。这是值得特别警惕的。所以不仅要重视调查研究，而且要认真采取具体措施来提高调查工作的质量，使每次调查工作都能收到应有的效果。
    明确调查工作的目的和任务，是作好调查工作的先决条件。在调查工作的开始，首先应当弄清楚在这次调查工作中要解决什么问题？需要掌握那些方面的材料，进行那些方面问题的研究，来完成调查工作的任务。明确了调查目的和任务之后，确定调查范围、组织调查力量、选择调查对象、考虑调查方式方法、制订调查计划等便有所依据。调查工作的目标分散、任务太多、范围太广，做起来总是比较困难的。最好是目的明确、中心突出、任务集中，这样，调查工作便容易做得深入透彻。
    干部的强弱对于调查工作的质量高低是有决定意义的，必须按照调查的目的和任务，配备较强的干部，组成力能胜任的调查组。在配备调查干部时要考虑到政治条件、理论水平、业务能力、工作经验等。其中最主要的一点，就是每个调查组必须有各方面水平较高的领队和一定数量能够独立工作的坚强骨干，所以，机关的领导同志和能力强的干部参加调查工作是十分必要的。一般组员亦应有一定的政治、业务水平，但也可以配备少数水平较低经验较少的干部，在工作中加以培养。调查组可以由一个单位单独组织，也可以以一个单位为主联合几个有关单位共同组成。联合调查组虽然有某些缺点，但只要调查的目的和要求基本一致，好处还是比较多的：第一、可以集中较多干部增强调查力量；第二、各单位的干部从各个不同的角度出发看问题，综合在一起比较全面；第三、以后几个单位在协同研究问题和改进工作上，认识容易取得一致。有时领导机关临时抽调有关事业单位的干部或技术人员一同下去检查另一些性质相同的事业单位的工作，这样，不仅对调查研究工作很有帮助，而且对这些参加工作干部思想和能力的提高也有很大的作用，是提高干部的有效方法之一。调查组必须有严密的组织、明确的分工和必要的纪律制度，防止发生不顾整体利益的本位主义、自由主义倾向，使调查组成为步调一致的坚强的战斗单位，这一点对于几个单位组成较大的联合调查组尤为必要。但在不妨碍整个调查工作的情况下，亦应适当照顾组员的工作经验和要求。
    调查组在出发之前应当做好各项准备工作。首先，作出切实可行的调查计划，根据调查的目的和要求，对调查工作的重点、步骤、方法等作妥善的安排；对于所要了解和研究的问题，应当写出调查提纲；这样，就不会在调查工作中迷失方向。调查计划和调查提纲最好在出发前送给被调查单位以及有关方面，使他们有充分时间进行准备。其次，对于与每次调查工作有关的政策应作进一步的研究，只有在掌握政策之后，才能正确地确定方向和辨别是非，分析问题才有可靠的绳准，也才能检查政策执行的情况和政策本身的正确程度。因此，在调查组出发之前，领导上应详细交代政策，参加调查工作的同志应阅读有关文件并进行研究讨论，力求掌握政策，出发时并应携带必要的有关文件，以备查考。再次，应当事先掌握被调查单位关于所要调查问题方面的已有材料，作为调查工作的基础，对于已有的统计数字、干部情况、工作报告、工作总结等，调查组在出发之前都应加以阅读和研究。为了充分做好准备工作，参加调查工作的同志在出发前一个时期就应当解除原有工作（时间长短视需要而定）以便有充裕的时间进行准备，如果没有时间保证，准备工作就会落空。
    做调查工作的同志必须有谦逊的态度和艰苦朴素的作风，谦虚地倾听别人意见。切忌趾高气昂，随意指摘批评，稍稍了解到一些情况即轻下结论。上级领导机关派下去的调查组应当特别注意这一点。调查组对于一切事情的安排，都应以是否便利调查工作为转移，例如，工厂的生活条件可能不及地方党政机关，但为了便于调查，就应当坚决住在工厂；到农村中去，如果缺乏交通工具，就应当步行，在生活和行动上应当保持艰苦朴素的作风。有些做调查工作的同志在吃饭、住房、坐车等生活问题上斤斤计较，不仅妨碍调查工作，而且在群众中造成不良影响。
    调查组必须和被调查单位密切合作才能顺利完成任务。不论调查或被调查方面，目的都在于弄清情况，研究和解决问题，以便改进工作，调查组可以邀请被调查单位派出干部参加调查工作，被调查单位也有责任帮助调查组弄清情况。可是，有些调查组不善于采取同志态度和被调查单位商讨问题，争取被调查单位的合作，到处吹毛求疵，使被调查单位感受到压力，因而被调查单位也就处处采取应付和提防的态度。在这种情况下，既不易弄清真实情况，双方也不易取得一致意见，因而，调查工作所起的作用往往是微弱的。另一方面，有时由于调查工作涉及被调查单位工作上所犯错误问题或其他原因，被调查单位采取不正确的态度对待调查工作，因而，调查工作便可能受到抵抗和封锁。这种情况虽然不常有，但做调查工作的同志也是应当提防的。
    调查工作必须依靠党、依靠政府、依靠群众。地方党委对于各方面的工作负有保证监督的责任，经常从政治原则上考虑问题，掌握干部情况，看问题比较全面；事业单位的党组织，负有保证完成行政任务的责任（工厂党组织并且要监督生产），和群众的联系密切，一般都能提供可靠的材料。所以调查组必须取得地方党委和被调查事业单位党组织的指导和协助。政府各业务行政部门是各项事业的主管机关（如工业行政部门对于工厂，卫生行政部门对于医院等），对于他们所主管的事业单位情况和问题了解得比较清楚，他们也有责任帮助调查组弄清所要了解的情况，所以调查组必须取得他们配合和帮助，请他们提供材料，乃至派出干部协同进行调查。更重要的是向群众调查，有些调查组满足于向地方党委和政府了解情况，而不深入现场向群众调查，所得到的材料常常是第二手的，对问题的看法只有领导的一面，缺乏群众的一面，往往是不深刻、不全面的。因而，便不能很好地完成调查任务。所以调查组必须深入工厂、农村、学校、医院……等，向做实际工作的干部调查，向基本群众调查，做实际工作的干部和工人、农民、教师、学生、医生等，情况了解得真切，虽然，有时只能提供不系统的原始材料和简单朴素的意见，但这些材料和意见都常常包含着重要的情节和客观真理，调查组可以从这里得到强有力的启发和确凿的根据，作为研究解决问题的坚实基础。所以调查组必须深入群众，适当地组织各种调查会、座谈会和进行个别访问，多多倾听做实际工作的干部和基本群众的意见。
    每一方面的工作都有一定的事业单位，例如工业的事业单位是厂矿，教育方面的事业单位是学校；每一种事业单位又都有自己的基本工作单位，例如工厂的基本单位是车间，部队的基本单位是连队，中、小学校的基本单位是班，高等学校的教学行政的基本单位是系（科）、教学工作的基本单位是教研室等。调查某一方面的工作情况，必须深入一两个事业单位；调查一个事业单位的情况，必须深入一两个基本工作单位，作为调查工作重点，集中人力、用充分的时间进行细致周密的调查，避免平均使用力量。但对非重点的单位也应适当地作一般了解，把点和面结合起来，互相对照研究，使调查工作做到既深入又全面。
    调查组必须全面而正确地掌握情况，才能为整个调查工作打下良好的基础。为了做到这一点，就需要从领导与群众、内部与外部等各方面搜集材料。由于各方面各个人所处的地位不同，工作的接触面不同，看问题的角度不同，所提供的材料和意见也就不会完全相同甚至根本不同。这些材料和意见可以互相补充，互相对证，互相发挥。调查组掌握各方面材料以后，看到他们共同的地方、一致的地方，也看到不同的地方、矛盾的地方；经过分析综合以后，就可以看清事物的全貌和问题的本质。“兼听则明，偏听则暗”这句话很有道理，偏听偏信是很危险的。所以调查组应当向党、政领导机关调查，向工会、青年团等群众团体调查，向做实际工作的干部调查，更要向基本群众调查；可以从一个事业单位外部的调查来了解其内部工作情况，也可以从事业单位了解上级领导情况和有关部门的工作情况。在调查当中可以向被调查单位搜集现有的统计数字、工作报告、工作总结等书面材料，这样，可以了解若干基本情况，节省许多时间；同时又可以和当前实际情况对照起来研究。在调查中参观或参加被调查单位的各种实际工作和具体活动（工作、会议、生产、学习、文娱……等）是有特殊意义的。从生动活泼的事物运动中最能看到真实情况、发现新鲜事物和重要问题。
    调查组所取得的材料必须是切实可靠的。因此，对于提供材料人的政治思想情况怎样？对待事物实事求是的精神怎样？在工作中所处的地位和利害关系如何？是亲身参加亲眼看到的还是道听途说的？对于这一方面的工作是内行还是外行？等等都应当弄清楚。对于重要材料，必须寻根究底地追问下去，不怕麻烦地从各方面调查对证，直到完全弄清楚了为止。对于时间、地点、人名、数字、证据、重要的事实等，弄清楚以后，都应详细加以记载。有的并应拍成照片或搜集实物作为例证。
    要善于发现在工作中的缺点和问题，也要善于发现工作中的成绩和经验。调查组在工作中能够发现缺点和错误，指出问题之所在，提出解决问题改善工作的办法。这是调查组必须求得的一个方面的结果。可是有些调查组的工作往往偏重于这一方面，而对于工作中的成绩和优点则很少注意研究，有的调查组做完了一个大区的某项事业调查，在上万字的长篇调查报告里竟看不到一点成绩和经验，这显然是不对的。实际，即使工作做得很坏的单位，个别的成绩和优点还是可以找出来的。所以，调查组对于工作中的新鲜事物必须有敏锐的感觉，善于发现新生的东西，纵然还处在萌芽状态；对于工作的革新者和先进工作方法，应当特别感到兴趣，即使是点滴经验和不很成熟的建议，也要加以重视和爱护。应当相信，我们许多干部和广大的工农群众及其他劳动人民，整年累月辛勤地工作着，不断运用他们的体力和智慧，在各种不同具体条件下，克服困难，取得成绩；在工作的过程中必然不断产生新的工作经验和工作的革新者。领导机关的重要任务之一，正是及时发现这些经验，加以研究总结，把它推广出去，以提高各有关单位的工作质量；及时发现工作中的先进单位和优秀工作者，加以帮助、培养，使成为工作中的模范和骨干。如果我们在调查当中只注意发现缺点和错误，而没有注意发现工作中的良好经验、先进工作单位和革新人物，这样的调查工作，顶多只能算完成一半任务。
      “调查”和“研究”必须密切结合起来进行，一方面搜集材料，一方面消化材料，如果只顾搜集材料，而忽视运用已取得材料来研究解决问题，将会成为材料的奴隶或埋葬在材料的大海里。所以调查组在进行调查的时候，应当一面调查，一面采取汇报、漫谈、讨论等方式加以分析研究，找寻解决问题的线索。在研究当中又会发现某些方面的材料不足、某些事实还没有弄清楚、某些方面出现值得注意的新的情况，对调查工作提出新的要求。特别是调查组搜集到基本材料、工作初步告一段落时，就应当用较多的时间，作较为全面的讨论研究。然后在这一阶段调查研究的基础上再提出几个重要问题，更进一步作细致深入的调查，逐步把问题研究清楚。所以在调查的过程中，必须把整理和研究材料的时间，调查组内的交换意见、漫谈、讨论的时间，适当地安排进去。
    调查报告是调查研究成果的集中表现，必须写好这个报告。调查组掌握丰富而确实的材料，从错综复杂的现象里找出问题的本质，用所取得的材料说明问题、解决问题，是最关重要的事情。写报告的时候，看问题应力求全面，应当看到好的、正确的、有利的……方面，也要看到坏的、错误的、不利的方面；各方面程度的深浅、关系的轻重、作用的大小等，都应当实事求是地给予恰当的估计，分寸掌握不稳，很容易得出片面性的结论。我们常常看到这样两类的调查报告：一类是列举许多事实，但没有深入地分析，没有明确地提出问题和讲清道理，也没有肯定地说明是非；另一类虽然提出了问题，肯定什么是对的或错的，但所提出的问题和所作的结论却是一般化的，如“思想领导薄弱”、“掌握政策有偏差”……等等；至于思想领导如何薄弱？为什么薄弱？引起什么后果？等等，则没有交代清楚。前者罗列事实，后者作出一般化的抽象结论，这两类报告所表现的形式虽然不同，但共同的缺点都在于没有能针对着具体情况进行具体分析。调查报告必须有确凿的事实根据，提出具体问题，从对事实的具体分析上找寻事物的内在联系。也就是根据事实进一步研究问题是在什么具体条件下产生的？发展的情况怎样？对各方面的影响怎样？性质是什么？有那些特点？根源是什么？关键在那里？……把这系列的问题研究清楚以后，再提出解决问题的具体的对策。这样的报告，有充分事实根据，有深入的分析研究，说明了是非曲直的道理，发现了症结之所在，提出了解决问题的具体办法，使调查工作得到应有的结果。对于工作所提出的批评或建议应当是客观的、切合实际的；同时，在提法上必须充分考虑到如何使这些批评建议能对当前的工作发生最大的积极作用，符合人民的最高利益，避免产生不良的副作用。不站稳工人阶级立场，采取“客观主义”的态度，不加区分地把所有的情况和意见都“和盘托出”，显然是错误的。调查报告应力求在事实上和政治上都是正确的。
    调查报告，一般应当就地写好，这样做法，好处很多：第一，写完调查报告才算做完结束阶段的最重要的一项工作，有始有终地完成一项调查；第二，调查组思想集中在所要调查的问题上，刚取得许多材料，印象很清新，及时加以总结较为便利，免得事过境迁，思想不集中，情况逐渐模糊下来；第三，调查组在外作调查，没有别的事情分心，较短时间内就可以把报告写起来；否则，回到机关以后，各人都可能有紧急的工作要做，不易集中力量研究总结，如果是几个单位联合组织的调查，各回各的机关，商量问题也不方便，工作的进行会增加很多困难，容易拖延时间，失去时效；第四，在进行调查工作的地方写报告，遇有材料不足，情况不清的地方，加以补充和对证时，也比较方便；回机关以后，遇到这种情况，就麻烦得多了。
    调查组在结束工作离开进行调查工作的地方以前，一般应当和被调查单位以及地方党、政领导机关的负责干部交换意见，虽然调查报告尚未经过本机关批准，所提出的意见和建议也不是正式决定，但作为调查组所看到的情况和初步意见提出来和他们交谈，还是有好处的。一方面被调查单位的同志一般都很希望听取调查组的意见，以便研究如何改进工作；另一方面，调查组也可以请被调查单位的同志对调查组所了解到的情况和意见作某些修正和补充，有些问题还可以共同作进一步的讨论和研究。这样，可以使调查报告更加完善。调查组对于交谈的内容应当经过充分准备，并应当采取研究和商量的态度来交谈。
    调查组回到本机关以后，应将调查报告提到有关的会议上讨论，并根据工作需要，作出某些改进工作的决定，尽可能采取具体措施使调查工作产生直接或间接的实际效果。如果认为调查报告写成以后，便算万事大吉，调查对实际工作不发生任何实际影响，这种形式主义的调查，是没有意义的。
    每次调查工作做完以后，调查组本身工作也应当认真总结一下，从而吸取每次调查工作的经验教训，以不断提高调查工作的质量。
