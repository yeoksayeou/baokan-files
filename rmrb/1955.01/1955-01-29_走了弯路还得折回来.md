Taking a Detour Means Having to Turn Back
Zhang Changzhen

After the Yanbei Prefectural Committee of Shanxi Province convened a mutual aid and cooperation conference in August 1954, the Guangling County Committee convened an enlarged cadre meeting of the county, districts, and townships. At this meeting, the county committee conveyed the spirit of the prefectural committee meeting: "This winter and next spring, we must welcome the high tide of cooperativization. We must first consolidate and improve the existing old cooperatives as examples to attract and encourage farmers to join. We must also conduct arduous work with newly joined farmers, publicizing mutual benefit and the specific policies of agricultural cooperatives to ensure that farmers join truly voluntarily." The county committee also assessed the favorable conditions for establishing cooperatives in the county: not only were there eighty-nine old cooperatives, but 48.9 percent of the county's total households had also participated in mutual aid teams, including more than 1,300 year-round mutual aid teams. Furthermore, the people in the old revolutionary base areas had a relatively high level of awareness. These were all correct. Guangling County indeed had eighty-nine old cooperatives, so many mutual aid teams, and was an old liberated area. However, the county committee failed to realistically assess the most important problem – that these eighty-nine old cooperatives had not demonstrated great superiority, and a large proportion of them had a very bad influence among the farmers. However, under the control of a blindly optimistic mood, the comrades of the Guangling County Committee were keen to "welcome the high tide of cooperativization this winter and next spring," and even put forward the slogan "Every village should have a cooperative, and flags should be planted everywhere." They did not emphasize clearly enough that "we must first consolidate and improve the existing old cooperatives…and conduct arduous work with newly joined farmers…". As a result, the cadres participating in the meeting one-sidedly understood "welcoming the high tide of cooperativization" and "every village should have a cooperative, and flags should be planted everywhere," fostering a sense of complacency and forgetting the need to work arduously. After returning to the villages, they carried out their work simply and rigidly, one-sidedly publicizing "welcoming the high tide" and "planting flags everywhere," and also adding "Taking the road of cooperativization is the broad road to prosperity, while going it alone is a dead end."

From August to the end of September, a vigorous campaign to "welcome the high tide of cooperativization" was launched throughout the county. Before August, the county committee planned that 28 percent of farmers would join cooperatives in 1955. After this, the county committee received reports from various village work teams stating that a certain percentage here, or the entire village there, had joined cooperatives, but they did not go down to check whether the farmers' registration to join was truly voluntary. In mid-September, the county committee reported that 38 percent of the farmers had joined. By the end of September, it was 41 percent. By the beginning of October, it was 51 percent. The Guangling County Committee requested the prefectural committee to approve this development number. After considering Guangling's work foundation, cadre conditions, and the level of mass awareness, the prefectural committee suggested that the Guangling County Committee reconsider. The Guangling County Committee then
  "considered it a bit," and also asked the county committee's rural work department about the actual situation of the masses joining cooperatives. The county committee's rural work department replied:
  "Now the number of farmers requesting to join cooperatives is already 54 percent." The county committee then reported this figure to the prefectural committee again, still requesting approval. The prefectural committee asked: "Are these farmers truly voluntary?" The county committee replied without consideration: "You couldn't beat them out of it with a stick."

Where did this "54 percent" actually come from? Just looking at the following facts is enough to know: In Tunbu, a county cadre named Gao Faqi demanded that 70 percent of farmers join cooperatives at a militia meeting; the meeting lasted all night, and whoever signed up was allowed to leave. A Comrade Du from the county grain bureau worked in a village, and he was not satisfied with 70 percent of the farmers joining cooperatives. He demanded "100 percent of households join cooperatives" at a mass meeting. At the time, 50 households signed up, of which 20 were not voluntary. The cadres of Masi'er Village held mass meetings, only asking the farmers: "Which road are you taking? If you are taking the capitalist road, don't join the cooperative!" A middle peasant in Dongchangbu sold his donkey because he was forced to join the cooperative and his thinking was not clear. The village cadres then held him and "rectified" his thinking for three days. When Beitong Dongbu Cooperative expanded, the cadres even proposed: "Whoever doesn't join the cooperative will have to sell more surplus grain!"

What was the thinking of the masses in Guangling County? Just looking at the following facts is enough to know: Qizui Village had more than 70 livestock in total. Ten middle-peasant households sold seven donkeys, three cattle, and one mule. One even exchanged a good donkey for a bad one. The middle peasant Song Leyi had three livestock and sold a large ox and a large donkey, leaving only a small calf. This was because he knew that the small calf could not be used, and even if he joined the cooperative, the cooperative would not want it, and he could maintain private ownership. Five middle-peasant households were also preparing to sell their livestock. A middle peasant in Shuijian Village felt that he had to join the cooperative, but if he joined, the livestock would be turned over to the public. So, he sold the horse first and then signed up to join the cooperative. Some farmers were afraid to join the cooperative, so they split their families into two. One family would join the cooperative with poor land, and the other would operate on their own with good land. The cadres of Xisi Village used the method of soft grinding in meetings to mobilize people to sign up to join the cooperative. 233 households signed up, and more than 60 of them were families that had split up. Wang Huaibao, a middle peasant in Shaquan Village, saw that "he had to join the cooperative," so he gave away the good land first and then joined the cooperative with the poor land. After joining the cooperative, everyone also asked to keep more private plots, wanting to rely on private plots instead of the agricultural cooperative. The Linjing Agricultural Cooperative had 20 households and only 700 mu of land. In 1954, the price of the donkeys that were turned over to the public was 10, the price of the cattle was 15, with a total value of 26 million yuan, and an annual interest of more than 2 million yuan. When the cooperative expanded last year, the farmers outside the cooperative were afraid that their sheep would be turned over to the public, so they sold 150 of the 300 sheep in the village, and slaughtered 80, leaving only 70.

In November, the county committee held a training class for agricultural cooperative cadres. Immediately afterward, it convened an enlarged cadre meeting of the county, districts, and townships. In this training class and meeting, the village cadres revealed the problems below, and the cadres who went to the countryside also reported the situation of coercion and commandism and the situation of the old cooperatives to the county committee. At this time, the county committee understood, and examined its mistakes. Under the guidance of the work team sent by the prefectural committee, the county committee and the county, district, and township cadres once again studied the Party's principles and policies on agricultural cooperativization and cleared their minds. Everyone realized that: in the past, they had taken a detour because of blind complacency, and now they had to turn back and start over, working arduously and meticulously.

After changing the style of work and correctly implementing the Party's policies, some people who had originally reluctantly joined the cooperative had their thinking cleared and became willing to join; some who were originally unwilling to join also signed up to join; and after persuasion and education, those who were truly unwilling withdrew from the cooperative. In Shaojiazhuang, 30 households originally signed up to join the cooperative, but they were not very stable. After carefully publicizing the Party's policies, another seven households newly signed up to join the cooperative. A middle peasant in Yidouquan was originally unwilling to join the cooperative because he was afraid that his livestock would be turned over to the public. Now that he understood that the agricultural cooperative could adopt several methods of using livestock, and that those who were unwilling to turn over to the cooperative could also adopt the method of renting, he said: "That's good, then I'll join the cooperative!"

    走了弯路还得折回来
    张长珍
    一九五四年八月，在山西雁北地委召开了互助合作会议以后，广灵县委召开了一次县、区、乡扩大干部会议。在这个会上，县委传达了地委会议的精神：“今冬明春要迎接合作化高潮，必须首先巩固和提高现有老社，作为吸引和鼓舞农民入社的榜样，并对新入社的农民进行艰苦的工作，宣传互利和农业社具体政策，达到入社农民真正自愿。”县委又估计了本县办社的有利条件：不但有八十九个老社，还有占全县总农户的百分之四十八点九的农户参加了互助组，其中还有一千三百多个常年互助组，老区人民群众的觉悟也比较高。这些都是正确的。广灵县确实有八十九个老社，有这么多互助组，而且是老解放区。可是，有一个最重要的问题县委却没有实事求是地加以估计——这八十九个老社并没有显示出很大的优越性，有很大一部分老社在农民当中影响很坏。但在盲目乐观的情绪支配下，广灵县委的同志们热衷于“今冬明春要迎接合作化高潮”，竟提出了“村村有社，普遍插旗”的口号；对于“必须首先巩固和提高现有老社……对新入社的农民进行艰苦的工作……”却讲得不够清楚。因此，参加会议的干部也就片面地领会了“迎接合作化高潮”，“村村有社，普遍插旗”，滋长了一种自满情绪，忘了要艰苦地进行工作。他们回到乡村以后，就简单生硬地进行工作，片面地宣传“迎接高潮”“普遍插旗”，还加上了“走合作化道路就是阳关大道，单干就是死路一条”。
    八月至九月底，在全县开展了轰轰烈烈的“迎接合作化高潮”的宣传。在八月以前，县委计划一九五五年入社的农户要达到百分之二十八。从这以后，县委收到各村工作组的报告，这里是百分之几十，那里是全村入社，却没有下去检查一下，看究竟农民报名入社是不是真正自愿。九月中，县委统计，入社的农民是百分之三十八。到九月底，已经是百分之四十一。到十月初，已经是百分之五十一。广灵县委请求地委批准这个发展数目。地委考虑了广灵的工作基础和干部条件、群众觉悟程度以后，提出让广灵县委重新考虑。广灵县委这时也
  “考虑了一番”，并且又向县委农村工作部询问群众入社的情况究竟怎样。县委农村工作部答复：
  “现在要求入社的农户已经是百分之五十四了。”县委就又把这数字报告给地委，还是要求批准。地委提出：“这些农民是不是真正自愿？”县委不加考虑地答复：“拿棒子打也打不出去。”
    这“百分之五十四”究竟是从哪里来的呢？只看这样一些事实就可以知道了：在屯堡，有个县干部叫高发其，在一个民兵会上要求百分之七十的农户入社；整整开了半夜会，谁报名放谁走。县粮食局有一位杜同志在一个村工作，百分之七十的农户入社还不能满足他的要求，他在一个群众会上要求“百分之百的户入社”。当时五十户报名，其中就有二十户并不自愿。马寺儿村干部开群众会，不讲别的，只问农民：“你走那条路？如果走资本主义道路就不要入社！”东常堡有一户中农，因为勉强入社，思想不通，把毛驴卖了；村干部就拉住他“整”了三天思想。北町东堡社扩大社时，干部甚至提出：“谁不入社，就得多卖余粮！”
    广灵县群众的思想到底怎样？只看这样一些事实就可以知道了：七咀村共有七十多个牲口，有十户中农卖了七条驴、三头牛、一个骡子，还有一个好驴换了赖驴。中农宋乐义共有三个牲口，把一个大牛和一个大驴都卖了，现在只剩下个小牛犊子。因为他知道小牛犊子不能使用，即便入社，社里也不要，还能保持私有。有五户中农还准备卖牲口。水涧村有一户中农感到不入社不行，入社牲口就得归公，先把马卖了，然后才报名入社。有些农民怕入社，把一家人分成两家，一家带上赖地入社，一家带上好地自己经营。西寺村干部用开会软磨的办法发动报名入社，报了二百三十三户，就有六十多户是分家的。沙泉村中农王怀保，看到“不入社不行”，先把好地送了人，然后带上赖地入社。入社以后，大家也纷纷要求多留自留地，想靠自留地，不靠农业社。林井农业社有二十户，只七百亩土地，一九五四年作价归公驴十头、牛十五头，作价两千六百万元，每年利息二百多万元。去年扩社时，社外农民怕入社羊归公，全村共三百多只羊，出卖一百五十只，宰杀八十只，现在只剩下七十多只了。
    十一月，县委举办了农业社骨干训练班。紧接着，又召开了县、区、乡扩大干部会议。在这训练班和会议上，乡村干部揭露了下面的问题，下乡干部也向县委报告了下面的强迫命令情形和老社的情况。这时，县委心里亮堂了，检查了自己的错误。在地委派来的工作组指导下，县委和县、区、乡干部又一次学习了党在农业合作化方面的方针政策，清醒了头脑。大家认识了：过去因为盲目自满走了弯路，以后还得折回来从头走，艰苦地、细致地进行工作。
    改变了工作作风，正确地贯彻了党的政策以后，一些原来勉强入社的人思想通了，变成了自愿入社；有些原来不愿入社的也报名入社了；经过说服教育，真正不自愿的人退出了社。邵家庄原来报名入社的有三十户，而且不很稳定；细致地宣传了党的政策以后，又有七户新报名入社的。一斗泉有个中农原来怕牲口作价归公而不愿入社；现在了解了农业社使用牲口可以采取好几种办法，不愿作价归社的还可以采用租用的办法，他就说：“这样好，那咱就入社吧！”
