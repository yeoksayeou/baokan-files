To develop camellia oleifera production, Shaoyang Prefecture in Hunan Province has decided to establish four state-owned camellia oleifera tree farms in Shaoyang, Shaodong, Xiangxiang, and Chengbu counties. The sites have now been preliminarily surveyed, and various preparations for establishing the farms are underway. These four farms plan to sow 15,000 mu of camellia oleifera trees this spring. In about ten years, these camellia oleifera forests will reach the peak production stage, and the Huboling site in Shaoyang alone will produce 100,000 to 150,000 jin of camellia oil annually.

In addition, preparations are being made to mobilize the masses to reclaim 100,000 mu of camellia oleifera forests this spring. Xinhua, Shaodong and other counties have convened representative meetings on camellia oleifera forest reclamation to study some specific measures related to reclamation.

    邵阳专区建立四个油茶林场
    湖南省邵阳专区为了发展油茶生产，确定在邵阳、邵东、湘乡、城步四县建立四个国营油茶林场。现在场址已初步测定，各项建场准备工作正在进行中。这四处林场，今春计划播种油茶林一万五千亩，再过十年左右，这些油茶林即达盛产阶段，仅邵阳湖泊岭一处，就可年产茶油十万斤到十五万斤。
    此外，还准备在今春发动群众垦复油茶林十万亩。新化、邵东等县已召开了油茶林垦复代表会，研究了有关垦复的一些具体措施。
