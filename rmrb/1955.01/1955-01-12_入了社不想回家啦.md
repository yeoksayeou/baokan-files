    Once I Joined the Cooperative, I Don't Want to Go Home Anymore!
    In Dingjia Yao Village, Huayin County, Shaanxi Province, there is a sixty-four-year-old man named Su Chunhe. In previous years, he often grumbled about wanting to return to his old home in Henan. Now, when someone asks him about returning to his old home, he says, "I have a gold mine and a silver mine here, why should I go home?"
    Old Su doesn't have a single piece of land or a single relative at home. Why did he always want to go back in the past? He really had his difficulties. Sixteen years ago, Old Su fled famine to Shaanxi, where he carried burdens and did odd jobs for people, and even cooked for the Taoists on Mount Hua. Year after year, he grew old and could no longer do heavy work. He was on the verge of begging for food. During the land survey and production determination, although he was allocated five mu of land, Old Su had no livestock or fertilizer, and he couldn't do heavy work, so he harvested very little grain. Whenever he was short of food and drink, he would often think of his old home.
    The agricultural production cooperative was established in the village the winter before last. Since Old Su joined the cooperative, he hasn't suffered anymore. In previous years, five mu of land could only yield 1.8 or 1.9 dou of wheat, but last year, with the cooperative providing fertilizer and weeding, he harvested 2.3 shi. In previous years, his clothes were dirty and ragged, his cotton-padded jacket was torn, and his single-layer clothes were falling apart. Last year, the female members of the cooperative took them apart, washed them, and mended them, making the cotton and single-layer clothes look new. What moved Old Su the most was that the cooperative arranged suitable work for him and didn't let him idle. For convenience, the cooperative uniformly assigned him to plant two mu of vegetables. Besides the light work of sowing seeds and weeding, the members helped him with carrying manure, turning the soil, and watering. Even so, he still worked seventy-one labor days in a year, earning 740,000 yuan.
    Now, Old Su feels that the cooperative is a big family, and the members all respect him as an elder. Therefore, he not only doesn't want to return to his old home, but he also discussed with the cooperative director his plan to plant five mu of vegetables this year to increase the cooperative's income!

    入了社不想回家啦
    陕西华阴县丁家窑村有一个六十四岁的苏春和老汉，往年常常唠叨着要回老家河南去，现在再有人问起回老家的事，他便说：“我这里背靠金山银山回家干啥？”
    老苏家里没有一分地，没有一口人，过去为什么老是想回去呢？实在有他的难处。十六年前，老苏逃难到陕西，给人家扛过活、打过短，还给华山上的道士做过饭。一年一年人老了，做活不行了，眼看就要讨饭啦。查田定产的时候，虽然给他调剂了五亩地，可是老苏没牲口少粪土，又干不了重活，粮食收得很少，每在缺吃少喝的时候，他往往就想起老家。
    前年冬季村里办起了农业生产合作社，老苏自从加入合作社以后，啥事都不受熬煎了。往年五亩地只能收一石八、九斗麦子，去年社里上粪、锄草打了两石三；往年衣服又脏又烂，棉袄开花、单衣挂絮，去年给女社员们拆拆洗洗、缝缝补补，棉的单的件件新。最叫老苏感动的是：社里安排下适当活路，没有叫他闲着。社里为了方便，统一叫他种二亩菜，除过下种、锄草等轻便活外，担尿、翻地、浇水都由社员帮着做，就这样一年还做了七十一个劳动日，收入七十四万元。
    现在，老苏感到社就是个大家，社员们都当老人敬奉他，因此，他不仅不想回老家，还跟社主任商量，打算今年种五亩菜，给社里增加一批收入哩！　（山川、王德兴）
