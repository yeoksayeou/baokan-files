    Promoting the Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy
    --Opinions from Various Countries on the Soviet Union's Wise Policy on Atomic Energy Issues
    Czechoslovakia
    Czechoslovakian newspapers commented on the decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers to assist other countries in promoting the peaceful use of atomic energy.
    "Red Right" wrote: The Soviet government's decision has significant international importance. This decision was made when proponents of atomic warfare openly expressed their intention to use atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. World opinion knows that in the United States, the great achievements of human wisdom and enormous material wealth are used to produce atomic weapons.
    The newspaper stated that the Soviet proposal convincingly proves once again that the principles that characterize the new type of relationship between countries in the peace camp are unshakable.
    German Democratic Republic
    Berlin democratic newspapers prominently published the Soviet government's statement on its decision to provide other countries with scientific, technical, and industrial assistance in promoting research on the peaceful uses of atomic energy on the 18th.
    All newspapers published the full text of the statement. "Neues Deutschland" was headlined "The Soviet Union will help the German Democratic Republic and other people's democratic countries to establish scientific atomic centers," "Junge Welt" was headlined "The Soviet Union helps the German Democratic Republic to establish scientific atomic centers," "National-Zeitung" was headlined "The Soviet Union is willing to enable us to establish scientific atomic centers," and "Berliner Zeitung" was headlined "The German Democratic Republic will get an atomic pile."
    Romania
    The Romanian newspaper "Scînteia" published an editorial on the Soviet statement about helping other countries to use atomic energy peacefully, saying: "The Soviet government's decision has great significance for the Romanian people because this decision opens up broad prospects for the development of our country's economy and culture, and for our country's prosperity and strength. This decision embodies the Soviet Union's wise policy on atomic energy issues and is a manifestation of its sincere commitment to peace and international cooperation." "Scînteia" emphasized that this decision embodies the eternal friendly and cooperative relationship between the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and embodies its efforts to elevate this cooperation to a higher stage.
    Sweden
    All newspapers on January 18th carried the news that the Soviet Union was willing to help some democratic countries in the peaceful uses of atomic energy.
    "Ny Tid" commented in an editorial entitled "Atomic Energy for Peace" on the Soviet Union's willingness to submit a report to the United Nations on the operations of Soviet atomic energy industrial power stations, emphasizing that this is new proof of the Soviet Union's consistent pursuit of a peaceful policy. "Ny Tid" said that the Soviet Union firmly believes that two different social systems can coexist peacefully, and it once again calls for negotiations on specific and decisive issues related to atomic energy. While welcoming this proposal, the people of all countries should demand an unconditional ban on the use of weapons of mass destruction and guarantee European security, and they must do everything in their power to smash the plans for rearming West Germany.
    Denmark
    The Danish newspaper "Land og Folk" published an editorial commenting on the two lines in atomic policy. The newspaper said that the Soviet Union's line is to use atomic energy for peaceful purposes and to openly share its experience with other countries. The other line is most prominently manifested in the decision made by the North Atlantic Group Council in Paris, which aims to prepare for atomic warfare. The newspaper said that General Gruenther, a major figure supporting the West's atomic warfare policy, may soon come to Denmark to explain to the Danish government and the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Lower House Denmark's tasks in a possible atomic war.
    Austria
    Austrian newspapers of various political views widely commented on the Soviet government's decision to provide other countries with scientific, technical, and industrial assistance in the peaceful uses of atomic energy.
    "Volksstimme" wrote: The Soviet government's decision proves that the Soviet Union's atomic energy technology has reached a high level. This great socialist country will help other countries develop atomic energy technology. The Soviet Union does not want to monopolize the rich scientific and technical experience it has gained in the peaceful uses of atomic energy.
    "Volksstimme" emphasized that, unlike the Soviet Union, the United States has been using the achievements it has obtained in the development of atomic energy for military purposes, to exert pressure on European countries. "Volksstimme" also said: The world historical significance of the Soviet government's decision lies in the fact that weaker countries will no longer be the object of pressure from the United States because they are now able to obtain from different sources the technical materials, valuable fissile materials, and equipment necessary to promote the peaceful uses of atomic energy.
    British Reuters
    Reuters reported the news that the Soviet government had decided to help other countries establish scientific research centers to develop research on nuclear physics and the peaceful uses of atomic energy, while pointing out that Western envoys in Moscow considered the decision a "practical proposal."
    Reuters went on to say, "This resolution was issued only three days after Russia suggested providing the world with a report on the operation of atomic power plants."
    Reuters emphasized this passage in the statement: "The Soviet Union is considering expanding the scope of the countries it can assist in the scientific research and experimentation for developing the peaceful uses of atomic energy."

### 促进原子能的和平用途——各国舆论评苏联在原子能问题上的英明政策

专栏：

    促进原子能的和平用途
    ——各国舆论评苏联在原子能问题上的英明政策
    捷克斯洛伐克
    捷克斯洛伐克各报评论苏联部长会议关于在促进原子能和平用途方面给予其他国家以帮助的决定。
    “红色权利报”写道：苏联政府的这个决定具有重大的国际意义。这个决定是在提倡原子战争的人公开表示企图使用原子武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器的时候作出的。世界舆论知道：在美国，人类智慧的伟大成就和巨大的物质财富都用在生产原子武器上面。
    报纸说，苏联的建议又一次令人信服地证明：标志着和平阵营国家新型关系的那些原则是不可动摇的。
    德意志民主共和国
    柏林民主报纸十八日以显著地位刊载了苏联政府关于决定在促进原子能和平用途的研究方面给予其他国家以科学、技术和工业援助的声明。
    各报刊载了声明的全文。“新德意志报”的标题是“苏联将帮助德意志民主共和国和其他人民民主国家建立科学原子中心”，“青年世界报”的标题是“苏联帮助德意志民主共和国建立科学原子中心”，“国民日报”的标题是“苏联愿意使我们能够建立科学原子中心”，“柏林日报”的标题是“德意志民主共和国将得到一个原子堆”。
    罗马尼亚
    罗马尼亚“火花报”就苏联关于帮助其他国家和平利用原子能的声明发表社论说：“苏联政府的决定对罗马尼亚人民有着巨大意义，因为这个决定为我国经济和文化的发展、为我国的繁荣富强打开了广阔的前景。这个决定体现了苏联在原子能问题上的英明政策，是它真诚地致力于和平和国际合作的表现。”“火花报”着重指出，这个决定体现了苏联和人民民主国家的永恒的友好合作关系，体现了它努力把这种合作提高到更高的阶段。
    瑞　典
    一月十八日各日报都刊载了苏联愿意在原子能和平用途方面帮助一些民主国家的消息。
      “新时代报”在一篇题为“原子能为和平服务”的社论中评论苏联愿意向联合国提出关于苏联原子能工业电力站工作情况的报告时强调指出，这是苏联始终不渝地奉行和平政策的新证明。“新时代报”说，苏联深信两个不同的社会制度能够和平共处，它再度要求就有关原子能的具体和决定性的问题举行谈判。各国人民在欢迎这个建议的同时，应该要求无条件禁止使用大规模毁灭性武器和保障欧洲安全，并且必须尽他们的一切力量来粉碎重新武装西德的计划。
    丹　麦
    丹麦“国土与人民报”发表社论，评论原子政策方面的两条路线。这家报纸说，苏联的路线是把原子能用于和平目的，并且向其他国家公开它的经验。另一条路线最突出地表现在北大西洋集团理事会在巴黎作出的目的在于准备原子战争的决定上。这家报纸说，支持西方原子战争政策的一位主要人物格仑瑟将军不久可能来到丹麦，向丹麦政府和下议院外交委员会说明丹麦在可能发生的原子战争中的任务。
    奥地利
    各种政见的奥地利报纸都广泛评论苏联政府关于在原子能和平用途方面给予其他国家以科学、技术和工业上的帮助的决定。
    “奥地利人民之声报”写道：苏联政府的这个决定证明苏联的原子能技术已经达到高度水平。这个伟大的社会主义国家将帮助其他国家发展原子能技术。苏联并不想垄断它在原子能和平用途方面所获得的丰富的科学和技术经验。
    “奥地利人民之声报”着重指出，和苏联不同，美国一直在把原子能发展中所获得的成就用于军事目的、用来对欧洲国家施加压力。“奥地利人民之声报”并说：苏联政府的决定的世界历史意义在于：较弱的国家将不再是美国施加压力的对象，因为它们现在能够从不同的方面得到促进原子能和平用途所必须的技术材料、贵重的可分裂物质和设备。
    英国路透社
    路透社报道了关于苏联政府决定帮助其他国家建立科学实验中心以发展对核子物理学和原子能的和平用途方面的研究的消息，同时指出：西方国家驻莫斯科的使节认为这个决定是“切实的建议”。
    路透社接着说，“在俄国建议向全世界提供关于原子能发电站的工作报告之后只过了三天，就发表了这个决议”。
    路透社着重指出声明中的这一段：“苏联正在考虑在发展原子能和平用途的科学研究和实验方面扩大它所能够援助的国家的范围的问题”。
