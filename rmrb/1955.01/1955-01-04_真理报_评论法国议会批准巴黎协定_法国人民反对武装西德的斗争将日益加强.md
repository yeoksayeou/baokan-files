   "Pravda" Comments on French Parliament's Approval of the Paris Agreements
    The French People's Struggle Against the Arming of West Germany Will Intensify
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd] According to TASS, Moscow, 2nd: "Pravda" published an article by an observer, commenting on the results of the French National Assembly's vote on the Paris Agreements.

    The observer pointed out at the beginning: The debate in the French National Assembly first of all shows that the French people oppose the Paris Agreements and the revival of German militarism.

    The observer pointed out: The pressure from Britain and the United States is tantamount to international blackmail and open interference in France's internal affairs. The purpose of this blackmail is to intimidate French public opinion, and this blackmail has been the main weapon of the United States and Britain, under the direct instructions of Washington, for a week.

    When discussing the results of the vote in the French National Assembly, the observer pointed out: Only a minority in the French National Assembly voted to approve the Paris Agreements. As everyone knows, in the British Parliament, only 42 percent of the members voted in favor of this agreement. If this minority does not even have the moral right to speak on behalf of the parliament, then how can they speak on behalf of the country? It should also be noted that all parties whose members voted in favor of the Paris Agreements have experienced divisions on the issue of the Paris Agreements.

    Right-wing socialists have worked particularly hard to get the Paris Agreements passed, for which they will have to answer to the people.

    "Observer" said: Summarizing everything mentioned above, it can be seen that the political task undertaken by the supporters of the Paris Agreements during the National Assembly's discussion of the agreements—to gather a "broad majority" among the bourgeois parties—has failed.

    The author pointed out in the end: The formal approval of the Paris Agreements in the National Assembly will instead strengthen the movement against the militarization of West Germany throughout France. Those who are trying to use the Paris Agreements to sharpen the international situation in Europe will have to take into account the growing struggle of the people of Western European countries against the formation of aggressive military blocs with the participation of a remilitarized West Germany. Peace-loving countries, ready to strike at any aggressive conspiracy, sympathetically watch this struggle of the French people and the people of other Western European countries.

### “真理报”评论法国议会批准巴黎协定  法国人民反对武装西德的斗争将日益加强

   “真理报”评论法国议会批准巴黎协定
    法国人民反对武装西德的斗争将日益加强
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二日讯：“真理报”刊载了观察家的一篇文章，评论法国国民议会关于巴黎协定的表决结果。
    观察家一开始就指出：法国国民议会的辩论首先说明：法国人民反对巴黎协定，反对复活德国军国主义。
    观察家指出：英国和美国的压力无异于国际讹诈和公开干涉法国内政。这种讹诈的目的是吓倒法国舆论，这种讹诈在一个星期中一直是美国的，也是在华盛顿直接指示下的英国的主要武器。
    观察家在谈到法国国民议会的表决结果时指出：在法国国民议会中投票赞成批准巴黎协定的仅是少数人。大家知道，在英国议会中，赞成这一协定的也只占议员的百分之四十二。如果这一少数甚至于没有道义上的权利来代表议会说话，那末，他们怎能代表国家说话呢？也不能不注意到，在有议员投票赞成巴黎协定的所有政党中都在巴黎协定问题上发生了分裂。
    右派社会党人特别卖力地使巴黎协定得以通过，因为这件事，他们将不得不对人民负责。
    “观察家”说：总结上面说到的一切，可以看出：巴黎协定的拥护者在国民议会讨论协定时所担负的政治任务——在资产阶级党派中搜罗“广泛的多数”，是失败了。
    作者最后指出：在国民议会中形式上批准巴黎协定，反而会加强法国各地反对西德军国主义化的运动。那些竭力要借助于巴黎协定来使欧洲国际局势尖锐化的人们，将不得不考虑到西欧各国反对拼凑有重新军国主义化的西德参加的侵略性军事集团的斗争日益增长的情况。准备对任何侵略阴谋以打击的爱好和平的国家，同情地注视着法国人民和西欧其他国家人民的这种斗争。
