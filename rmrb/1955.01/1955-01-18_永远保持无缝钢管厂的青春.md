The Angang Steel Rolling System implemented the Soviet experts' recommendations, stopping production once or twice a month to inspect equipment, ensuring the normal operation of the equipment. The Seamless Steel Tube Plant completed its planned equipment inspection at the end of December last year, understood the degree of wear of each component, recorded more reliable defect items, surveyed the drawings of certain spare parts, and replaced some easily worn parts. The major inspection was carried out according to the instruction charts. On the day before the inspection began, the Seamless Steel Tube Plant held a splendid get-together party. The inspectors gathered together, raised challenges and accepted them, and set off a wave of labor emulation. Although the automated equipment of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant is complex and sophisticated, the workers have earnestly studied and thoroughly implemented technical regulations and job regulations, ensuring the progress and quality of the major inspection. The oilers used their own created automatic oil spraying tools to give the factory's machinery a new look. They want to keep the Seamless Steel Tube Plant forever young.

    永远保持无缝钢管厂的青春
    鞍钢轧钢系统执行了苏联专家的建议，每月停止生产检查一次至两次设备，保证了设备的正常运转。无缝钢管厂在去年十二月底完成了有计划的设备检查，了解了每个部件的磨损程度，记录了比较可靠的缺陷项目，测绘了某些备品的图纸，更换了一些易磨的零件。大检查是按照指示图表进行的。开始检查的前一天，无缝钢管厂举办了精采的联欢晚会，检查的人们欢聚一堂，在会上提出了挑战、应战，掀起了劳动竞赛的热潮。虽然无缝钢管厂的自动化设备复杂、精巧，但工人们认真的学习，彻底贯彻了技术规程和岗位规程，保证了大检查的进度和质量。油工们用他们自己创造的自动化喷油工具，为全厂的机械换上了新装。他们要永远保持无缝钢管厂的青春。
