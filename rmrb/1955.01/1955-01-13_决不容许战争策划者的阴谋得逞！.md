We Must Never Allow the Conspiracies of the War Plotters to Succeed!
	Jiang Yuanchun

The American aggressor bloc has announced that it will hold a meeting of the Manila Treaty participating countries in Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, on February 23 to discuss "ways to implement the Manila Treaty." This is a new step taken by the United States to intensify tensions and prepare for war in Asia.

The so-called "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" signed in Manila last September is part of the United States' global war preparation plan and an important tool for the United States to pursue its war and aggression policies in Asia. Fair-minded Asian public opinion has long pointed out that the main purpose of this treaty, planned single-handedly by the United States, is to enslave the Asian people, suppress the Asian people's national liberation movement, undermine peace in Indochina, and organize an aggressive military bloc to divide Asia and prepare for war.

The United States is so eager to put this aggressive bloc into action. It has even decided to convene the Bangkok meeting to discuss the implementation of the treaty before all the countries participating in the Manila Treaty have ratified it. The reason is that the American aggressor bloc, in order to coordinate its activities in the West to revive German militarism, wants to step up war preparations in the East and try its best to expand this bloc, roping in more Asian countries to serve the war policy of the United States.

Because the American aggressor bloc opposes increased mutual understanding between Asian and African peoples, and opposes international cooperation, and because the United States is trying to maintain and strengthen its colonial rule over many regions in Asia and Africa, the American aggressor bloc and its followers are very discriminatory towards the Asian-African Conference. The Bangkok meeting, chosen to be held before the Asian-African Conference, is obviously intended to obstruct and undermine the Asian-African Conference. The American "Business Week," published on January 8, already said hopefully that if the Bangkok meeting could formulate an "effective" military plan, some Asian countries close to the United States would refuse to participate in the Asian-African Conference. As a coordination in this regard, British Foreign Secretary Eden will visit some Asian countries after the Bangkok meeting. Sources in London revealed that Eden's purpose is to use the results of the Bangkok meeting to induce these countries not to engage in the cause of expanding the peace zone.

The agenda of the Bangkok meeting that has been revealed is precisely drawn up according to these goals of the United States. The primary issue on the agenda of the Bangkok meeting is military issues. In Dulles's words, it is to organize the military forces of the Asian countries participating in the treaty, making them "strategically distributed reserves" to cooperate with the "mobile attack force" of the American naval and air forces. The meeting will also discuss the establishment of a permanent command headquarters to command this cannon fodder force. The purpose of the visit to Asia by the Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Radford, is also to prepare for this plan. It is very clear that after the signing of the US-Chiang treaty, and after the United States publicly announced that it would use its naval and air force "mobile attack force" to attack the Chinese people, the establishment of "reserves" in Asian countries through the Manila Treaty organization is an important step in the US aggression against China's war conspiracy.

The Bangkok meeting will also discuss the issue of suppressing Asian national liberation movements under the pretext of "discussing the most urgent subversive activities in the treaty area." It is revealed that a unified intelligence agency will be established at the Bangkok meeting to strengthen espionage activities in various Asian countries. Strengthening this espionage activity is not only to suppress the resistance of the Asian people who demand peace against the US war policy, but also obviously to carry out subversive activities within Asian countries that refuse to participate in the Manila Treaty, attempting to finally pull these countries into the Manila Treaty group. The recently revealed conspiracies of American spies among the Naga people in Indonesia and the border areas of India and Burma clearly prove this point.

The American aggressor bloc is now vigorously promoting that the Bangkok meeting will also discuss the so-called "economic assistance" to Asian countries. However, this so-called "economic assistance" is nothing but a smokescreen to cover up American aggression. The State of the Union address in the United States claims that the United States will "continue to implement a vigorous plan to stockpile strategic materials and rare materials." It is very obvious that any so-called "economic assistance" plan for Asia cannot but be subordinate to the consideration of the American aggressor bloc to plunder strategic raw materials. Dodge, who is responsible for drafting the US "economic assistance" plan for Asia, declared on December 21 last year that if Asian countries are to gain the greatest benefit from US "economic assistance," "they must agree to take stricter self-help measures than before." This shows that the United States is also attempting to control Asian countries politically and economically through this so-called "assistance," turning them into appendages of the United States. However, this trick of the United States has also been seen through by some Asian countries. From the mouth of U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Murphy, people have obtained the United States' own confession that the United States' so-called "economic colonialism" cannot be concealed from people.

From the information that has been revealed, the Bangkok meeting will also focus on studying how to obstruct the implementation of the Geneva Agreement on the restoration of peace in Indochina. As everyone knows, according to the Geneva Agreement, Laos and Cambodia will hold national general elections in 1955. Vietnam should hold national general elections in July 1956. From July 20, 1955, the representative responsible authorities of both regions of Vietnam should negotiate on this issue. Obstructing these general elections from becoming truly democratic and free elections is a major conspiracy of the American aggressor bloc. Foreseeing that the Ngo Dinh Diem group would be defeated in the general election, the United States, disregarding the provisions of the Geneva Agreement, instructed the Ngo Dinh Diem group to implement a reign of terror in South Vietnam and is talking about using military actions to obstruct the implementation of the Geneva Agreement. At the same time, more and more news says that the United States is turning Cambodia into another base of aggression. It is very clear that the purpose of the American aggressor bloc is to undermine the Geneva Agreement and maintain Indochina as a hotbed for the United States to launch aggressive wars.

Establishing and expanding aggressive military forces in Asia, preparing for new wars, intensifying the suppression of Asian people who demand peace, democracy, freedom, and independence, creating divisions in Asia, and obstructing the expansion of the peace zone are the sinister purposes of the Bangkok meeting. However, when the American aggressors are making such wishful calculations, they have misremembered the times. They have forgotten that the people in vast areas of Asia are no longer people who can be manipulated at will. These people will never allow the conspiracies of the war plotters to succeed!

    决不容许战争策划者的阴谋得逞！
    蒋元椿
    美国侵略集团已经宣布在二月二十三日在泰国首都曼谷举行马尼拉条约参与国的会议，讨论“执行马尼拉条约的办法”。这是美国在亚洲加紧制造紧张局势和进行战争准备的新步骤。
    去年九月在马尼拉签订的所谓“东南亚集体防务条约”，是美国在全世界准备战争的计划中的一部分，是美国在亚洲推行战争政策和侵略政策的重要工具。亚洲公正舆论早已指出，这个由美国一手策划的条约的主要目的，是在奴役亚洲人民，镇压亚洲人民的民族解放运动，破坏印度支那的和平，组织侵略性的军事集团来分裂亚洲、准备战争。
    美国是这样迫不及待地企图使这个侵略集团行动起来。它甚至等不及参加马尼拉条约的所有国家批准这个条约，就决定召开曼谷会议来讨论条约的实施问题。其原因就是美国侵略集团为了配合它在西方复活德国军国主义的活动，要在东方加紧进行战争准备，并竭力企图扩大这个集团，网罗更多的亚洲国家来为美国的战争政策服务。
    因为美国侵略集团反对亚非人民之间增进相互了解，反对国际合作，因为美国力图保持和加强对亚非两洲很多地区的殖民统治，所以美国侵略集团和它的追随者十分歧视亚非会议。曼谷会议选择在亚非会议之前召开，显然也是为了对亚非会议进行阻挠和破坏。一月八日出版的美国“商业周刊”已经满怀希望地说，如果曼谷会议能够拟订出一个
  “有效的”军事计划，某些接近美国的亚洲国家就会拒绝参加亚非会议。作为这方面的配合，英国外交大臣艾登将在曼谷会议之后访问亚洲的一些国家。伦敦方面的消息透露，艾登的目的是想用曼谷会议讨论的结果，来诱使这些国家不从事于扩大和平地区的事业。
    已经透露出来的曼谷会议的议程，正是根据美国的这些目标拟订的。列在曼谷会议议程上的首要问题是军事方面的问题。用杜勒斯的话来说，就是组织参加条约的亚洲国家的军事力量，使它们成为配合美国海空军“机动攻击力量”的“按照战略分布的预备队”。会议还要讨论建立指挥这支炮灰部队的常设司令部的问题。美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福的亚洲之行的目的，也是在为这个计划进行准备。十分明显，在美蒋条约签订以后，在美国公开宣布要用它的海空军“机动攻击力量”进攻中国人民以后，美国通过马尼拉条约组织来建立亚洲国家的“预备队”，是美国侵略中国的战争阴谋中的重要步骤。
    曼谷会议还将在“讨论条约区域内最紧急的颠覆活动问题”的借口下，讨论镇压亚洲民族解放运动的问题。据透露，在曼谷会议上将要成立一个统一的情报机构，来加强对亚洲各国的特务间谍活动。加强这种特务活动，不仅是为了镇压要求和平的亚洲人民对美国战争政策的反抗，而且显然也为了在拒绝参加马尼拉条约的亚洲国家内部进行颠覆活动，企图最后把这些国家拉进马尼拉条约集团。最近被揭露的美国间谍在印度尼西亚和印度、缅甸边境上的那加族中间的阴谋活动，就清楚地证明了这一点。
    美国侵略集团现在大肆宣传说，曼谷会议也将讨论所谓对亚洲国家的“经济援助”问题。但是，这种所谓“经济援助”只不过是用来掩饰美国侵略的烟幕。美国的国情咨文中声称，美国将要“继续执行一个有力的储存战略物资和稀有物资”的计划。很明显，任何对亚洲的所谓“经济援助”的计划，都不能不服从于美国侵略集团掠夺战略原料的考虑。负责拟订美国对亚洲的“经济援助”计划的道奇在去年十二月二十一日宣称，如果亚洲国家要从美国的“经济援助”中得到最大的利益，“它们必须同意采取较前严格的自助措施”。这就表明，美国还企图通过这种所谓“援助”来在政治上经济上控制亚洲国家，使它们沦为美国的附庸。但是，美国的这种花招，也早已被亚洲有的国家识破了。从美国助理国务卿墨菲口里，人们得到了美国的自供，美国的所谓“经济殖民主义”瞒不了人。
    从已经透露的消息看来，曼谷会议还将着重研究如何阻挠恢复印度支那和平的日内瓦协议的实施。大家知道，按照日内瓦协议，老挝和柬埔寨将在一九五五年内举行全国普选。越南应在一九五六年七月内举行全国普选。自一九五五年七月二十日起，越南双方地区有代表性的负责当局应就此项问题进行协商。阻挠这些普选成为真正民主的自由选举，是美国侵略集团的重大阴谋。由于预见到吴庭艳集团会在普选中遭到失败，美国不顾日内瓦协议的规定，指使吴庭艳集团在南越实施恐怖统治，并且正在谈论用战争行动来阻挠日内瓦协议的实施。同时，越来越多的消息说，美国正在把柬埔寨变为它的另一个侵略基地。很明显，美国侵略集团的目的是要破坏日内瓦协议，将印度支那保持为美国发动侵略战争的温床。
    在亚洲建立和扩大侵略性的军事力量，准备新战争，加紧镇压要求和平、民主、自由、独立的亚洲人民，在亚洲制造分裂，阻挠和平地区的扩大，这些就是曼谷会议的凶恶目的。但是，美国侵略者在打着这种如意算盘的时候，却把时代记错了。他们忘记了现在的亚洲已有广大地区的人民不再是可以任人摆布的人民。这种人民决不会容许战争策划者的阴谋得逞！
