Xinhua News Agency, Dispatch from Paris, January 9th: Agence France-Presse (AFP), in commenting on the policies of the new Japanese government, pointed out the "increasing trend of Japan breaking away from its subservience to Washington's policies."

AFP, in discussing the reaction in Japanese public opinion to Eisenhower's recent State of the Union Address to the U.S. Congress, pointed out: This address was very unpopular in Japan. Japanese newspapers believe that the policy announced by Eisenhower is a "big stick" policy, and they accuse the U.S. President of taking a dismissive attitude towards the issue of peaceful coexistence.

AFP also pointed out that Japan's desire to implement more independent policies is also manifested in the current Japanese government's attitude towards the invitation to participate in the Asian-African Conference to be held in Bandung this spring. As everyone knows, Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu once said: Generally speaking, Japan treats this invitation with goodwill.

AFP finally said: "The Tokyo cabinet is expected not to let go of the opportunity to gain independence." AFP emphasized again: The Japanese government still insists on "forming an alliance with Washington," stubbornly claiming that "based on strategic and economic considerations," this alliance is necessary for Japan.

    法新社评日本新政府的政策指出
    日本想执行独立性更大的政策
    【新华社十日讯】　据塔斯社巴黎九日讯：法新社在评论日本新政府的政策时，指出了“日本脱离服从华盛顿的政策的趋势日益加强”。
    法新社讲到日本舆论界对于艾森豪威尔最近给美国国会的国情咨文所引起的反应时指出：这个咨文很不受日本的欢迎。日本报纸认为艾森豪威尔宣布的方针是一种“大棒”政策，并且指责美国总统对于和平共处问题采取轻视态度。
    法新社还指出，日本要执行独立性更大的政策的愿望，还表现在当前的日本政府对于邀请它参加将在今年春天在万隆举行的亚非会议一事的态度上。大家知道，日本外务相重光葵曾说过：一般地说，日本是善意地对待这个邀请的。
    法新社最后说：“东京内阁可望不会放过获得独立的机会。”法新社又着重说：日本政府仍然主张“和华盛顿结成同盟”，硬说“根据战略和经济的考虑”，这种同盟是日本所必要的。
