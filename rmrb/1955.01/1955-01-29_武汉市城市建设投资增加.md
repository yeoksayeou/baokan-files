    Wuhan City's Investment in Urban Construction Increases

    Wuhan City's estimated investment in urban construction this year will exceed the total investment in urban construction in the five years after liberation.

    This year's engineering tasks include: the construction of nine new-style streets ranging from several kilometers to more than ten kilometers in length, and the reconstruction of several old streets. The area of the new streets will be more than half the area of the original streets in Wuhan City before liberation. These newly built and renovated streets will further connect the original urban area with the new industrial areas and suburbs. This year, three waterworks in the city will be expanded or renovated. By the end of this year, after these projects are completed, the water supply capacity of Wuhan City's waterworks will increase by at least more than double. The total length of new sewers to be built this year will be close to half the length of the original sewers in the entire city before liberation. At the same time, several large-scale sewage pumping stations and a catchment channel will be built. In addition, the construction of dikes to ensure the safety of the city, the construction of workers' dormitories and residential areas, the laying of substations, transmission lines, and communication lines, as well as the addition of entertainment venues and urban beautification work in various places, will continue. The dike tasks to be completed before the flood season this year include: filling and excavating more than 5 million cubic meters of earthwork, repairing dozens of culverts and revetments of more than 4,000 meters, and building 3,000 meters of waterproof walls.

    In order to strive for the victorious completion of this year's urban construction plan, new institutions related to urban construction have been successively established since the fourth quarter of last year, and the original institutions have also been continuously expanded, and various preparations for this year's projects have begun. Since mid-January, some street projects and transmission line projects have started construction, and the team participating in dike construction has nearly 40,000 people. (Xinhua News Agency)

    武汉市城市建设投资增加
    武汉市今年城市建设的投资估计可超过解放后五年来城市建设投资的总和。
    今年的工程任务中包括：新建九条长几公里到十几公里的新式街道，改建若干旧的街道。新建街道的面积比武汉市解放前原有街道面积的一半还多。这些新建和改建的街道将进一步使原有市区和新工业区、郊区连贯起来。今年全市将有三个自来水厂进行扩建或改建。到今年年底，这些工程完工以后，武汉市的自来水厂供水能力至少将增大一倍以上。今年新建的下水道的总长度，将接近于解放前全市原有下水道长度的一半，同时将新建几个规模较大的抽污站和一个集水渠。此外，确保全市安全的堤防建设工程，工人宿舍和居住区的建筑工程，变电站、输电线和通讯线路的敷设工程，以及各地娱乐场所的增建和城市美化工作等，也将继续进行。将要在今年汛期以前完成的堤防任务有：填挖五百多万公方的土方，整修几十个涵闸和护坡四千多公尺，筑防水墙三千公尺。
    为了争取胜利完成今年的城市建设计划，从去年第四季度起，有关城市建设的新的机构就陆续开始建立，原有机构也在不断扩充，并开始了今年工程的各项准备工作。一月中旬以后，一部分街道工程和输电线工程已着手施工，参加堤防建设的队伍已有近四万人。（新华社）
