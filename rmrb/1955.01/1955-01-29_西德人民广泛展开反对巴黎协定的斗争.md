Xinhua News Agency, 28th dispatch: According to TASS, the Bonn rulers are ignoring Soviet proposals for the restoration of German unity and are trying their utmost to have the Paris Agreements ratified. This approach has been met with increasingly widespread and strong opposition from the people of West Germany.

    Residents of Augsburg held a mass rally under the slogans "Down with the Paris Agreements!" and "We demand all-German elections and a four-power conference!" German Communist Party representative Wasch spoke at the meeting, pointing out the fatal consequences that the Paris military agreements would bring to the German people. A torchlight procession was held after the rally.
    A march against the Paris Agreements was also held in a workers' residential area of ​​Bochum. The marchers chanted: "We don't need American weapons. We want to work for peace," "Parents, protect your sons from warlords," "Against the ban on the German Communist Party," and "We unanimously demand the rejection of the Paris Agreements."
    Stuttgart held a mass rally against the Paris Agreements, and fighters from the French Resistance Movement sent representatives to participate in the rally.
    The youth of Mülheim held a conference to oppose the recruitment of West German youth to the revived German "Bundeswehr." Representatives of various youth organizations emphasized at the meeting that the Soviet government's proposals in the statement on the German question provided the possibility of holding free all-German elections. The conference also wrote to the members of the Bundestag, demanding that the issue of ratifying the Paris Agreements be removed from the agenda.
    Representatives of all youth organizations in Solingen, in order to oppose the war preparations of the Bonn authorities, decided to form an "Association against Military Service, against Remilitarization, and to Fight Militarism."
    The "League of Opponents of Military Service" held a meeting in Hamburg. Kuhn, a member of the Social Democratic Party in the Bonn Bundestag, spoke at the meeting, calling for an agreement with the Soviet Union and opposing Bonn's policy of expanding armaments and refusing negotiations.
    Young miners and construction workers in Duisburg-Bruckhausen decided to hold a protest demonstration on the day the Bundestag held its second reading on the Paris Agreements and to send their delegation to Bonn. Young workers in Diezenbach, Hesse, also called on all young trade union members in Hesse to organize a "protest trip" to Bonn.
    At a representative conference of various youth organizations held in the Neukölln district (American-occupied zone) of West Berlin, a resolution was unanimously adopted calling on German youth to unite and fight together against the Paris Agreements. The resolution also called for a national vote against the Paris Agreements.
    Women in Oberhausen elected a delegation to petition members of the Bundestag, demanding that they oppose the Paris Agreements and advocate negotiations on the peaceful restoration of German unity. Leaders, pastors, and believers of the Evangelical Church in Hesse also signed leaflets against arming West Germany.
