    Winter schools in the rural areas of the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region in Hunan Province have generally opened. It is estimated that more than 100,000 Miao and Han farmers have enrolled, an increase of about 10% compared with the winter before last. In addition to literacy, this year's winter schools in various regions will also study the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and rural mutual aid and cooperation policies. In some areas, these contents are compiled into Miao songs and explained to cater to the preferences of Miao farmers.

    Since last autumn, the Autonomous Region People's Government has established organizations to lead winter schools and trained more than 2,000 winter school teachers in various counties. These winter school teachers include junior high school and primary school graduates, demobilized soldiers in rural areas, and Miao farmers who are good at singing. (Xinhua News Agency)

    湘西苗族自治区农村冬学开学
    湖南省湘西苗族自治区农村冬学已普遍开学，入学的苗、汉族农民估计约有十万多，比前年冬天增加百分之十左右。各地冬学，今年除了识字外，还要学习中华人民共和国宪法和农村互助合作政策。有的地区根据苗族农民的喜爱，把这些内容编成苗歌进行讲解。
    去年秋后，自治区人民政府就成立领导冬学的机构，在各县训练两千多名冬学教师，这些冬学教师包括初中和小学毕业生、在乡村的转业军人和善于唱歌的苗族农民。　　（新华社）
