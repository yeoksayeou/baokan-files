    Fierce Attack on Yijiangshan Island
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Hua Min
    On the afternoon of the 18th, I followed the landing headquarters of our army and stepped onto Haimen Reef on the north island of Yijiangshan Island. It was the breakthrough point for our army's landing forces. At that time, the island was filled with smoke and dust caused by our army's bombing, artillery fire, and blasting. The vanguard troops had already fiercely attacked the high ground called the "Central Village" by the Chiang bandit troops. On the rocky beach of the breakthrough point, the earth and stone walls and fortifications painstakingly constructed by the Chiang bandit troops were almost completely destroyed, and the trenches and communication trenches were also flattened. A reinforced concrete bunker was blown up, leaving only one corner. Many bunkers and fortifications were burning and smoking. The three lines of barbed wire, each two to three hundred meters wide, were also blasted by our army's shells and bombs, leaving only two crooked wooden stakes.
    The command post for the landing forces was set up under a cliff on the north island. A dense sound of machine guns and submachine guns was heard hundreds of meters away. The artillery fire accompanying the infantry's advance fiercely bombarded the western commanding height, Height 203. This height was named "Important Village" by the Chiang bandit troops. It was surrounded by trenches and barbed wire, and had many permanent and semi-permanent fortifications. In the dense sound of gunfire, the voices of our soldiers fighting bravely often came from that direction. At this time, the radio operator reported: "A key point west of 'Important Village' and 'East Mountain Village,' which is close to the Chiang bandit Yijiangshan area headquarters, have been occupied by our army." Before long, we saw the red flag of victory flying on Height 203, shrouded in smoke.
    I advanced along the road that the soldiers had just bravely opened, and saw many corpses of Chiang bandit troops lying along the way. The American-made carbines in their hands were all broken, some with only a wooden handle left. The Chiang bandit troops' documents were scattered all over the ground, and many were blown away by the sea breeze.
    The soldiers excitedly escorted the prisoners down. One prisoner was brought to the command post. He was wearing a single pair of trousers, his face was covered with dust, and he had a bandage on his head. He held his own seal and said with his head lowered: "I am Wang Fubi, the commander of the Fourth Assault Battalion."
    This Chiang bandit army battalion commander said with lingering fear: "The People's Liberation Army's artillery and air force are really too powerful. Our wired telephone lines were all cut off during your first bombardment. As soon as I came out of the bunker door, I was injured by a bomb, and I don't know where the other personnel of the battalion headquarters went!"
    At this time, our army was continuing to advance bravely. I stood next to a broken bunker on the western highlands of the north island, looking at the south island of Yijiangshan Island across a small body of water. After our troops landed there, they immediately launched a fierce attack under the cover of the air force and artillery. They quickly seized the positions of howitzers and chemical mortars set up there by the Chiang bandit troops, and eliminated the threat of these heavy guns to the landing forces on the north island. Now the soldiers are searching for the remnants of the enemy, and the gunfire is gradually thinning out, but our army's artillery fire supporting the attack on the south island of Yijiangshan Island is still very fierce.
    As dusk approached, the Chiang bandit troops' ammunition depot was still exploding, and the raging fire ignited by the gasoline depot reddened the sea and the sky. In one place, the remaining troops of the Chiang bandit army were still resisting stubbornly. Our army commander immediately issued an order to the attacking troops: "If the enemy does not surrender, resolutely eliminate them." The soldiers used artillery to directly aim at the Chiang bandit troops' bunkers and fire, and dense machine gun bullets also flew towards the stubborn Chiang bandit troops. These Chiang bandit troops were all wiped out. On the newly liberated island of our motherland, the soldiers' shouts of victory rang out.

    强攻一江山岛
    新华社记者  华敏
    十八日下午，我随着我军的登陆指挥所踏上了一江山岛北岛的海门礁。那里是我军登陆部队的突破口。当时岛上弥漫着我军轰炸、炮击和爆破时所引起的烟尘，先头部队已经猛攻到蒋贼军称为“中心村”的高地。在突破口的岩滩上，蒋贼军苦心构筑的土石围墙和工事，几乎被全部摧毁，堑壕和交通沟也被炸平了。有一个钢骨水泥的碉堡被炸得只剩下一只角。许多地堡和工事，正在燃烧和冒烟。三道两三百公尺宽的铁丝网，也被我军的炮弹和炸弹炸得只剩下了两根歪斜的木桩。
    指挥登陆部队的指挥所设置在北岛上的一个悬崖下。在几百公尺以外，密集地响着机关枪、冲锋枪的射击声。伴随步兵前进的炮火，猛烈地轰击着西部制高点二零三高地。这一高地被蒋贼军取名为
  “重要村”，四周筑有一道又一道的堑壕和铁丝网，并有许多永久性、半永久性的工事。在密集的枪炮声中，时常从那个方向传来我军战士们勇猛作战的声音。这时无线电员报告：“‘重要村’西面的一个要点和紧靠蒋贼一江山地区司令部的‘东山村’，都被我军占领了。”不一会，我们就看到了在硝烟弥漫的二零三高地上飘扬起胜利的红旗。
    我沿着战士们刚刚奋勇打开的道路前进，看见一路上横着许多蒋贼军的尸体。他们手里的美式卡宾枪都已炸坏了，有的只剩下一个木柄。蒋贼军的文件狼藉满地，有许多被海风吹得满天飞扬。
    战士们兴奋地押着俘虏走下来。有一个俘虏被带到了指挥所。他穿着一条单裤，满脸尘埃，头上扎着绷带。他拿着自己的一颗图章，低着头说：“我是王辅弼，突击第四大队的大队长。”
    这个蒋贼军的大队长心有余悸地说：“解放军的炮兵和空军实在太厉害。你们第一次轰击，我们的有线电话就全部中断了。我一出地堡门就被炸弹炸伤，大队部的其他人员也不知道到那里去了！”
    这时我军正在继续向前奋勇推进。我站在北岛西部高地的一个破地堡旁边，遥望隔着一道小水的一江山岛南岛。我们部队在那里登陆以后，就在空军和炮兵的掩护下立刻展开猛攻。他们很快就抢占了蒋贼军设置在那里的榴弹炮和化学迫击炮的阵地，解除了这些重炮对北岛登陆部队的威胁。现在战士们正在搜索残敌，枪声逐渐稀疏下来，但我军支援攻击一江山南岛的炮火还是很猛烈。
    黄昏降临的时候，蒋贼军的弹药库还在爆炸，汽油库燃起的熊熊大火映红了海面和天空。有一处地方，蒋贼军的残余部队还在负隅顽抗。我军指挥员立刻向攻击部队发出“敌人不投降，就坚决消灭它”的命令。战士们用大炮直接瞄准蒋贼军的碉堡发炮，密集的机关枪子弹也飞向顽抗的蒋贼军。这些蒋贼军就被全部消灭了。在刚刚解放的祖国的海岛上，响起了战士们胜利的欢呼声。
