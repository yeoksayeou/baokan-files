World Public Opinion Demands Elimination of International Tension; Malenkov's Answers to American Reporter's Questions Generate Huge Repercussions
Poland
    The Polish "People's Tribune" pointed out: Malenkov's reply mentioned that maintaining peace between the Soviet Union and the United States requires both sides to consider the possibility and necessity of peaceful coexistence and their legitimate common interests. This reflects the feelings of people of all countries and humanity's most natural and urgent desire for peace. The "People's Tribune" also pointed out: The French National Assembly, under the crude pressure of the United States and Britain, passed the Paris Agreements, which aroused obvious anger among the people of various countries on the European continent. The "People's Tribune" pointed out: Faced with the threat of the revival of the West German war machine, the countries of the peace camp, especially those countries that the Bonn militarists are attempting to invade, must unite.
Romania
    The Romanian "Spark" newspaper, in an editorial titled "Unite to Defend Peace - The Most Important Task of the People of All Countries," pointed out: The Soviet leader's reply to the American reporter clearly explained the most acute international issues and pointed out the path to resolving these issues in the interests of peace. Therefore, this is an important contribution to consolidating the cause of peace.
    The "Spark" newspaper welcomed Malenkov's statement that the Soviet Union is willing to do everything possible to ensure lasting and consolidated peaceful relations between the Soviet Union and the United States. It also agreed with Malenkov's view that negotiations to resolve some Far Eastern issues are welcome.
Bulgaria
    The Bulgarian "Workers' Cause" newspaper's editorial quoted Malenkov's following statement: The main reason for international tensions is that some Americans are adopting a policy of rebuilding the revanchist West German army, engaging in an arms race, and establishing a network of American military bases around the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries. The "Workers' Cause" pointed out: The main reason for the tension between the Soviet Union and the United States must be eliminated in order to largely eliminate international tension. Now, peace-loving people all over the world must be especially vigilant against the aggressive bloc's plans for new military adventures. There is no more important task than uniting the efforts of the people of all countries to safeguard peace and international security.
France
    Paris newspapers on the 3rd published comments on Malenkov's answers to questions from the Washington branch manager of the American "Telecommunications Communication Agency" in prominent positions.
    "Le Figaro" raised the question of the prospects for negotiations between the East and the West. It agreed with the unfounded claim that the ratification of the Paris Agreements improved the prospects for negotiations between the East and the West. Other right-wing newspapers adopted the same position. "The Volunteer" newspaper believed that it is possible to convene a meeting to discuss Far Eastern issues. This newspaper also believed that the results of negotiations on Asian issues may also lead to a productive meeting to discuss European issues.
    Gudard, a commentator on foreign policy issues for "L'Humanité," pointed out: Those who advocate militarizing West Germany are attempting to cover up their actions with the claim that negotiations are still possible after the Paris Agreements are ratified. However, it is very clear that after the Paris Agreements are ratified, negotiations with the East on the German question will be pointless. The reason is simple: there is nothing to discuss. Malenkov gave a thorough answer to this question in his reply to the American "Telecommunications Communication Agency" reporter's question.
    "L'Humanité Dimanche" emphasized: Malenkov talked about the issue of world peace in his reply to the American reporter's question. He once again stated that the Soviet Union is willing to do everything possible to make the policy of consultation and coexistence a success. This statement caused a huge reaction.
England
    Malenkov's answer to American reporter Short's questions aroused great interest in London. Although the news about the answers to the questions arrived in London very late, most newspapers on January 1st delayed their publication to publish the news.
    When a British Foreign Office spokesperson mentioned Malenkov's opinion that it would be welcome to conduct diplomatic negotiations to resolve Far Eastern disputes, taking into account the experience of the Geneva Conference, he admitted that "the Geneva Conference was beneficial." He then pointed out: The British government hopes to ease the tension in the Far East. But he insisted that, at this stage, "discussing Far Eastern affairs" would not be very successful.
    When talking about Malenkov's answer to the question of promoting negotiations for a summit conference of the four major powers, the British Foreign Office spokesperson said:
    "The Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary have stated our country's policy more than once." The spokesperson then quoted the British official's reply, saying that no four-power negotiations would be possible at all before the final ratification of the Paris Agreements. This shows that the British government still intends to pursue a "policy of strength."
    On the 3rd and 4th, all London newspapers published the British Foreign Office's comments on Malenkov's answers to reporters' questions. Some newspapers only selected a part about the Far East issue.
United States
    Malenkov's reply to the questions raised by Short, the Washington branch manager of the American "Telecommunications Communication Agency," aroused obvious panic among the American ruling group. This is manifested in: When American newspapers published news about Malenkov's reply, they tried their best to avoid Malenkov's most important points. Most American newspapers were limited to reporting Washington's "indifference" to Malenkov's reply.
    Wagner, the Washington diplomatic reporter for "The New York Times," pointed out: "American diplomatic officials reacted coldly to the Soviet Union's new expression of willingness to hold negotiations on resolving the Far East issue. They regarded Malenkov's intention to hold East-West talks with full participation of Communist China as a 'simple repetition' of the established Soviet policy and rejected it."
    It is worth noting that among the various international issues mentioned by Malenkov, American newspapers mainly commented on the point of resolving the Far East issue through negotiations. At the same time, commentators tried their best to make people believe that such negotiations would not be beneficial.
    When talking about the German question, only a small number of newspapers attempted to refute Malenkov's reply.
    For example, "The New York Herald Tribune" believes: "The most important point currently raised by the Russian Premier may be to demand that measures to arm West Germany be stopped as a condition for improving US-Soviet relations." This newspaper also insisted that the Soviet Union's proposal on the German question contained "danger" for Western countries. The newspaper said that the Soviet Union's purpose was to "split the West and have an impact on the West." It wants Western countries to "unite firmly," that is, blindly follow American policy.

### 世界舆论要求消除国际紧张局势  马林科夫答美国记者问引起巨大反响

    世界舆论要求消除国际紧张局势
    马林科夫答美国记者问引起巨大反响
      波　兰
    波兰“人民论坛报”指出：马林科夫的答复谈到，要保持苏联和美国之间的和平，就要求双方考虑到和平共处的可能性和必要性以及它们正当的共同利益。这反映了各国人民的心情和人类要求和平的最自然的迫切愿望。“人民论坛报”同时指出：法国国民议会在美国和英国的粗暴压力下通过巴黎协定，引起了欧洲大陆上各国人民明显的愤怒。“人民论坛报”指出：在西德战争机器复活的威胁面前，和平阵营各国，特别是波恩军国主义分子所企图侵略的那些国家，必须联合起来。
      罗马尼亚
    罗马尼亚“火花报”在题为“团结起来保卫和平——各国人民最重要的任务”的社论中指出：苏联领袖对美国记者的答复清楚地说明了最尖锐的国际问题，指出了为了和平的利益解决这些问题的道路，因此，这是对巩固和平事业的一个重要贡献。
  “火花报”欢迎马林科夫谈到苏联愿意尽一切力量来保证苏联和美国之间的持久的和巩固的和平关系的话，也赞成马林科夫表示欢迎举行解决若干远东问题的谈判的意见。
      保加利亚
    保加利亚“工人事业报”的社论引述了马林科夫的下面这段话：国际局势紧张的主要原因是某些美国人士正在采取重建复仇主义的西德军队、进行军备竞赛以及在苏联和其他爱好和平的国家的周围建立美国军事基地网的方针。“工人事业报”指出：必须消除使苏联和美国之间存在着紧张局势的这个主要原因，才能在很大程度上消除国际紧张局势。现在，全世界爱好和平的人民要特别警惕侵略集团进行新的军事冒险的计划。再没有比联合各国人民的努力来保障和平和国际安全这个任务更重要的了。
      法　国
    巴黎各报三日以显著地位刊载了关于马林科夫答美国“电讯通讯社”华盛顿分社社长问的评论。
    “费加罗报”提出了东西方谈判前途的问题。它赞成这样一种毫无根据的说法：巴黎协定的批准改善了东西方谈判的前途。其他右翼报纸也采取了同样的立场。“义勇军报”认为：召开讨论远东问题的会议是有可能的。这家报纸并且认为：举行关于亚洲问题的谈判，其结果也可能召开一个有成效的讨论欧洲问题的会议。
    “人道报”外交政策问题评论员古达德指出：主张使西德军国主义化的人企图用巴黎协定批准以后仍有可能进行谈判的说法来掩饰自己的行动。但是，十分明显，批准巴黎协定以后，同东方举行关于德国问题的谈判就会是没有目的的谈判了。理由很简单：没有什么东西可以讨论了。马林科夫在回答美国“电讯通讯社”记者的问题时已经对这一个问题作了透澈的答复。
      “人道报星期日刊”着重指出：马林科夫在答复美国记者的问题时谈到了世界和平问题。他再次表明苏联愿尽一切力量，使协商和共处的政策获得胜利。这个声明引起了巨大的反响。
      英　国
    马林科夫答美国记者萧特问引起伦敦很大的兴趣。虽然关于答记者问的消息到达伦敦很迟，但是一月一日大多数报纸都推迟出报时间，刊载了这个消息。
    英国外交部发言人提到马林科夫所说的考虑到日内瓦会议的经验，就解决远东纠纷进行外交谈判是应该欢迎的这个意见时，承认“日内瓦会议是有益的”。他接着指出：英国政府希望缓和远东的紧张局势。但是他又硬说，在现阶段“讨论远东事务”是不大会成功的。
    在谈到马林科夫对促成四大国政府首脑会议的谈判这个问题的答复时，英国外交部发言人说：
  “首相和外交大臣的言论已经不止一次地说明了我国的政策。”发言人接着引述英国官方人士的答复说，在最后批准巴黎协定之前，根本不可能举行什么四大国谈判。这就说明英国政府还是打算推行
  “实力政策”。
    三日和四日，伦敦所有的报纸都刊载了英国外交部对马林科夫答记者问的评论。有些报纸只选择了关于远东问题的一部分。
      美　国
    马林科夫对美国“电讯通讯社”华盛顿分社社长萧特提出的问题的答复，引起了美国统治集团的明显的慌乱。这表现在：美国报纸在刊载关于马林科夫的答复的消息时，竭力规避马林科夫的最重要的论点。大部分美国报纸仅限于报道华盛顿对马林科夫的答复的“冷淡”。
    “纽约时报”驻华盛顿外交记者瓦根纳指出：“美国的外交官员对苏联准备就解决远东问题举行谈判的新表示，反应冷淡。他们把马林科夫力求在共产党中国充分参加下举行东西方会谈的意图看成是‘简单地重复’既定的苏联政策而加以拒绝。”
    值得注意的是：在马林科夫所谈到的各个国际问题中，美国报纸评论的主要是关于通过谈判解决远东问题这一点。同时，评论员竭力使人相信，这种谈判是不会有好处的。
    在谈到德国问题时，只有为数不多的报纸企图反驳马林科夫的答复。
    譬如，“纽约先驱论坛报”认为：“俄国总理目前提出的最重要的一点，可能是要求停止武装西德的措施，以此作为改善美苏关系的条件。”这家报纸同时还硬说苏联关于德国问题的建议，对西方国家说来，包藏着“危险”。报纸说，苏联的目的是要“分裂西方并且对西方产生影响”。它要西方国家“坚决团结起来”，就是说应该盲目追随美国的政策。
