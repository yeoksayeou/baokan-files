Editor's Note: Recently, many rural cadres and farmers have written to say that after many farmers sell agricultural products or local and special products, they do not know how to properly handle the cash in their hands, so some people waste it, and some people take it to engage in speculative business. This is a major issue related to farmers' production and consumption, and it deserves everyone's attention. We are now selecting several letters to publish in the hope that rural cadres and readers in various places will actively participate in the discussion and propose some practical and feasible methods to help farmers properly arrange their economic lives.

How Should Farmers Spend Their Money?

Why Some People Don't Live Well
People's Representative of Xinfu Township, Fuyang County, Yao Wenji

I am a farmer from Sizhou Village, Xinfu Township, Qingyun District, Fuyang County, Zhejiang Province. Our village has 530 mu of rice fields and 110 mu of tea fields.

Before liberation, we farmers were very poor. At that time, people inside and outside the village said that Sizhou Village was a "collapsing stove village." Three-quarters of the village's fields were occupied by landlords in and outside the village. More than half of the village's 90-plus farming households often ran out of food. Some were unable to live and were forced to flee famine and beg for food. It was not until liberation that we had our own rice and tea fields. Our lives are getting richer year by year.

In 1954, 73 households in the village had surplus grain to sell to the state, with an average of about 620 jin per household. Now everyone in the village has one or two sets of flower flannel, People's Blue or blue khaki clothes, and some cash on hand, ranging from 5-6 million yuan for the more wealthy, to at least 100,000 yuan for the less well-off.

After the villagers had cash, some people said, "Now that we have more money, why not eat and spend a little? Are we going to take it to the coffin one day?" So some people began to eat and drink extravagantly. Zhang Fengmei in our village had no house or land before liberation. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, she carried her son and daughter everywhere to beg for food. In the five years or so since liberation, she has had a tile-roofed house and has built three new houses. In 1953, she sold 1,000 jin of surplus grain, more than 180 jin of tea, and some silk, for a total income of more than 2.5 million yuan. When her family married her son's wife in March 1954, she said, "Hey! What does it matter if you don't spend some money?" Therefore, she bought dressing tables, mirror boxes, made tents, cotton quilts, and clothes, and slaughtered pigs and sheep to hold six tables of banquets. She invited relatives and neighbors from far and near to eat and drink. After March, all her money was gone, and she was in debt. She had originally planned to buy iron rakes and chemical fertilizers, but she didn't have the money to buy them. By May, she didn't even have enough food. Later, it was the state that provided a loan, and she was able to buy food. After the autumn harvest, she sold the surplus grain and tea and earned another 2 million yuan, but after paying off the debts and the bank loan, the money was gone again! Now, in the spring of 1955, she has no money to buy the fertilizer needed for spring plowing - 600 jin of lime, 40 jin of fertilizer powder, and 30 jin of alum.

There is also a tea farmer in our village named Hong Guanggen, with a family of three. His tea income in 1953 was more than 3 million yuan, and his income from slaughtering pigs for others was more than 1 million yuan. Besides eating, he had 4 million yuan in cash. He said, "I don't lack anything now. Even if I don't eat, I can't spend the money." So he went to the hotel every day. Usually, he had to drink half a jin or a jin of wine, and sometimes he had to drink two or three jin of sorghum wine a day. He spent 25,000 yuan a day on wine and cigarettes alone. In the end, an income of 5 million yuan was not enough to spend. During the spring plowing season in 1954, he couldn't even afford to eat. Fortunately, the National Bank lent him 100,000 yuan to buy food.

The above are just two examples of spending money recklessly. There are many such phenomena in our village. Now that the farmers in our village have just finished selling their surplus grain, everyone has a lot of money in their hands again. I think that rural cadres, people's representatives, party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and activists should all lead the farmers to have a good discussion on this important issue and put forward opinions on the correct use of the money in their hands based on the specific circumstances of the local area and their families. This will benefit both the country and the farmers.

The Worries of Middle Peasant Wang Wan
Wang Zhiping

In Xinzhuang Township, Third District, Luoyang County, Henan Province, there is a middle peasant named Wang Wan who is 63 years old. He has been a hard worker all his life and has a family of six. His family farms 22 mu of land, feeds a cow and a mule, and has three large houses and eight cave dwellings, four of which are vacant and uninhabitable. Now his annual income and living standards are many times better than before liberation. It stands to reason that he should be living comfortably and should be happy. But now there is one thing that is making Wang Wan worry. What is going on?

Before liberation, although he farmed so much land, life was very difficult. Since liberation, his life has been getting better year by year. He remembers that before liberation, each mu of wheat always yielded only one load (140 jin), and at most twelve loads a year. In 1950, the same land yielded fifteen loads of wheat. After that, it increased year by year. Although there was a frost disaster in 1953, it still yielded sixteen loads of wheat. In 1954, it yielded twenty-four loads of wheat. The output of cotton and millet has also been increasing year by year.

Because of the high income, low burden, and stable prices, his family's life is much better than before liberation, and it is not difficult to invest in production! Before liberation, his family's annual expenses did not exceed one million yuan. In 1953, the whole family spent more than 2.8 million yuan on production and living materials, and in 1954, they had already spent 3.17 million yuan before the end of the year. They are very rich in food and clothing.

In the past few years, his family has been selling surplus grain and cotton every year, so he often has cash on hand. In 1954, he sold another 1,150 jin of surplus grain, and now he has a surplus of 2.1 million yuan in his hands. For a while, he felt that he had nowhere to use it, so he was worried. Sometimes he thought about buying another ten mu of land, but he was afraid that people would say that this was taking the capitalist road. At the same time, he thought: What do I need so much land for! As long as you put more manure and cultivate well, one mu is as good as several mu. One day, he was talking in the field with a well-to-do middle peasant named Dongliang in his village. Dongliang said: "We will have to join the cooperative soon anyway, so don't throw more money into the land. If you put more manure, isn't it just a personal loss!" He thought to himself: "That's right!" So he didn't want to buy fertilizer either. He also thought: "To hell with it, my wife and I are over sixty years old, so it's a good idea to buy two sets of coffin boards." He personally went to Mengjin County three times to buy coffin boards, but he didn't want to buy them because the price of the boards was too expensive. He also thought: Let's build some more houses, but there are clearly four vacant cave dwellings that no one lives in. He is now worried about the money in his hands every day and doesn't know how to spend it. This problem is not just Wang Wan's family; there are many people in the village like him.

The Same Emancipation, Two Different Lives
Farmer of Waicun Township, Shunde County, Huang Hongfu

Our Waicun Township in Shunde County, Guangdong Province, is an economic crop area, with sugarcane and fish ponds accounting for 80% of the cultivated land area. After the land reform in 1952, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the farmers in the whole township were allocated land and organized mutual aid and cooperation, and their lives gradually became prosperous. However, some farmers do not use the fruits they have been allocated to develop production, but want to engage in speculative trading, eating and drinking extravagantly, which I think is wrong. Huang Houchang, a farmer in our township, had been a hired worker for 14 years. During the land reform, he and his wife and six children were allocated nine mu of rice fields, fish ponds, and sugarcane fields, as well as more than 3 million yuan in rent refunds and a good house, as well as a lot of furniture. That year, he harvested 1,500 jin of grain from the rice fields he cultivated himself. If the existing surplus grain and money were invested in production, the income in 1953 would be very considerable; however, Huang Houchang did not do this. He put several million yuan in his pocket and spent money casually, so that several million yuan was wasted and not much was left. At this time, a peddler named Zhu Sheng came to him to do business. They jointly went to Panyu to transport wax apples. They lost a total of 600,000 yuan after five trips. They blamed each other for a while and broke up. Huang Houchang went home and had a fight with his wife, but he was still not convinced, and he still felt that doing business was more cost-effective than agricultural production, so he and his old acquaintance, the hooligan Luo Huazhu, jointly invested 500,000 yuan to transport chickens and ducks to Xiaohang Town, Zhongshan County. They lost another 300,000 yuan after three times. Seeing that the "chicken trading" business could not be done, they planned to trade dogs, and lost 300,000 yuan in one trip. As a result, the production was ruined: the fish in the fish pond ran out, and the rice field harvest was also bad. They ate all the food before the New Year.

During the spring plowing season in 1954, Huang Houchang's family had no food. They barely made it through by relying on loans and advance purchase deposits. He always wanted to take advantage of others. During the spring plowing season, he didn't sow the seeds himself, thinking of buying the remaining seedlings from others when it was time to transplant the seedlings; who knew that everyone was careful, and no one had any seedlings left. After the spring plowing season, other people's rice fields grew strong seedlings, but his rice fields grew weeds. It was not until the beginning of summer that he transplanted the late rice seedlings. Others harvested two crops a year, but he only harvested one crop; others harvested 500 jin of grain per mu, but he only harvested 300 jin. Even adding the sugarcane harvest, the income was only more than 2 million yuan. After paying off the loan, it was not enough to live on. This is the result of Huang Houchang taking the wrong path.

Xue Saojiu, an emancipated farmer in our township, took a different path from Huang Houchang. Xue Saojiu, like Huang Houchang, was allocated the fruits of the struggle, but Xue Saojiu invested the fruits in expanding production and also participated in mutual aid groups to solve the difficulty of labor. Therefore, his production has been continuously improved and his life has been continuously improved.

Xue Saojiu's family has nine people, and his labor force is not stronger than Huang Houchang's. He has six young children and an old father. Only he and his wife work. Xue Saojiu also works in the township, and the whole family actually has one and a half laborers. During the land reform, he was allocated 13 mu of rice fields, fish ponds, and sugarcane fields. The rent refund of 4 million yuan plus the original farming income, a total of more than 6 million yuan, was invested in agricultural production in 1953. That year, his income from sugarcane fields and rice fields alone was more than 13 million yuan. He left the production investment for 1954, made 13 sets of clothes and two cotton quilts for adults and children, and fed five pigs; the remaining money was deposited in the bank for 700,000 yuan, bought public bonds for 300,000 yuan, and lent the remaining 300,000 yuan to the members of the mutual aid group he led to organize.

The harvest in 1954 was not as good as the previous year, but when calculated carefully, the total income was still about the same as the previous year, also about 10 million yuan. This is how he spent the money he earned in 1954: After deducting agricultural tax, water conservancy fees, and food for a total of more than 2.8 million yuan, he invested another 3.6 million yuan in the production cooperative, repaid the pre-purchase payment of 420,000 yuan, and the rest was left for miscellaneous household expenses. Most of his income is used for production, which is one of the important reasons why his life is getting richer and richer.

专栏：农民应该怎样支配手里的钱

    编者按：最近有许多农村干部和农民来信说，不少农民出售农产品或土产、特产品以后，不知道应该怎样正确处理手中的现款，以致有人浪费掉了，有人拿了做投机生意去了。这是一个有关农民生产和消费的大问题，值得引起大家注意。现在我们选择几封来信发表出来，希望各地农村的干部和读者踊跃参加讨论，提出一些切实可行的办法，帮助农民恰当地安排经济生活。
    农民应该怎样支配手里的钱
    为什么有的人日子过不好
    富阳县新福乡人民代表　姚文积
    我是浙江省富阳县青云区新福乡泗洲村的一个农民。我们村有稻田五百三十亩、茶田一百一十亩。
    解放前，我们种田人是很贫困的。那时，村里村外的人都说泗洲村是个“倒灶村”，全村有四分之三的田为本村和外村的地主霸占了；全村九十多户农民中，几乎有一半以上常常断炊了；有的没法生活下去了，逼得出外逃荒、讨饭。直到解放，我们才有了自己的稻田和茶地。我们的生活一年比一年富裕了。
    一九五四年，全村七十三户有余粮卖给国家，平均每户能卖出六百二十斤左右。现在村里人人都有了一到两套花哔叽、人民蓝或蓝卡叽的衣服，手头都有些现款，多的五六百万元，少的也有百多万元。
    村里人有了现款，有些人就说：“现在钱多了，不吃点，花点，难道日后还带到棺材里去？”于是有的人大吃大喝起来。我们村上的张凤妹解放前没有房子、田地，抗日战争的时候，背着儿子、女儿到处去讨饭。解放后五年光景，她有了一间瓦房，还新盖了三间房子。一九五三年她卖了一千斤余粮、一百八十多斤茶叶，还卖了一些蚕丝，总共收入二百五十多万元。一九五四年三月间她家娶儿媳妇的时候，她说：“嗨！不用点钱，算得个啥样？”因此，她就买梳?镜箱、做帐子、棉被、衣服，还杀猪宰羊，办了六桌酒席。邀请了远近的亲邻来吃喝。三月过后，她家的钱全部光了，还拖了一身债，本来打算买铁耙、化学肥料的，结果也没有钱去买了。到五月间，连口粮都没有了。后来，还是国家贷了款，她才买到了口粮。秋后她把余粮和茶叶卖掉又收入二百万元，可是还了债和银行的贷款，钱又光啦！一九五五年春耕时需要的肥料——六百斤石灰、四十斤肥田粉和三十斤矾，现在已经没钱买了。
    我们村里还有这样一个茶农，他叫洪光根，全家三口人。他一九五三年茶叶的收入有三百多万元，给人家宰猪工钱收入的有一百多万元，除了吃饭，他有四百万元的现款。他说：“我现在什么都不差，不吃点，钱也用不了。”于是他天天上酒店，平时总要吃半斤、一斤酒，有时一天要吃二、三斤高粱酒。他每天单花在酒烟上的钱就是两万五千元。到头来五百万元的收入还是不够花。一九五四年春耕生产时，他连饭都吃不上了，幸亏国家银行贷给了十万元才买了口粮。
    以上只是乱花钱的两个例子，这种现象在我们村里还有不少。现在我们村里农民刚卖完余粮，大家手里又有许多钱了。我认为农村里的干部、人民代表、党员、团员和积极分子，都应当领导农民很好地讨论这个重要问题，根据本地和家庭的具体情况，提出正确地使用手里的现钱的意见，这对国家对农民才都有好处。
    中农王万的心事
    王治平
    河南省洛阳县三区辛庄乡有个中农叫王万，今年六十三岁，一生好劳动，家里有六口人。他家种二十二亩地，喂着一头牛、一匹骡子，有三间大房、八孔窑洞，内有四孔闲着住不了。现在每年的收入和生活水平都比解放前强好多倍。按说日子应该过的很舒坦，心里也该高兴啦。可是现在有一件事却使王万心里发愁。这到底是咋回事呢？
    在解放前，他虽也种这么多地，可是日子过得很艰难。自从解放以后，他的日子就一年比一年强了。他记得解放前每亩麦老是只打一装（一百四十斤），一年最多打十二装；一九五○年还是这些地，就打麦十五装；以后年年增加，一九五三年虽然遭到霜灾，还打麦十六装；一九五四年打麦二十四装。棉花、谷子等也是年年增产。
    由于收入多，负担轻，物价又稳定，他家的日子比解放前强的太多啦，生产投资也不作难啦！解放以前他家每年的花费折算起来不超过一百万元。一九五三年一年全家买生产资料和生活资料共花费二百八十多万元，一九五四年不到年底已经花了三百一十七万元，吃的、穿的都很富裕。
    过去几年，他家年年卖余粮和棉花，因此手里经常有现款。一九五四年又卖余粮一千一百五十斤，现在他手里有二百一十万元余款，一时感到没处用，他便发愁了。有时他想着再买十来亩地，可是又怕人家说这是走资本主义道路。同时也想：要恁多地做啥哩！只要多上点粪，耕种的好，一亩也顶好几亩。有一天他同本村一个叫东亮的富裕中农在地里说话，东亮说：“不久咱们也得入社啦，反正不用往地里多扔钱，上粪多，还不是个人吃亏！”他一想：“就是呀！”于是肥料也不想买了。他又想着：“管他三七二十一，俺老俩口也六十多岁啦，去买两付棺木板还算是正事。”为买棺木板他亲自到孟津县城跑了三趟，嫌木板价钱太贵没舍得买。他又想着：再盖些房子吧，可是明明有四孔闲窑洞没人住。他现在天天为了手里的这些钱发愁，不知道究竟应该怎样化。这个问题不光是王万这一户，村里边像他这种情况的还有不少哩。
    一样翻身，两样生活
    顺德县外村乡农民　黄洪福
    我们广东省顺德县外村乡是经济作物区，甘蔗和鱼塘占耕地面积百分之八十。一九五二年土地改革后，全乡农民在共产党领导下分到了土地，并且组织互助合作，日子逐渐过得富裕起来。可是有一些农民分到的果实不用来发展生产，却想去做投机买卖，大吃大喝，我认为这是不应该的。我乡农民黄厚胜，解放前做过十四年雇工，土地改革时，他和老婆孩子六口人分到九亩稻田、鱼塘、蔗田，还分到三百多万元退租钱和一座好房子，家具也不少。这一年他在原有自种的稻田中收获了一千五百斤谷子。如果把现有的余粮余钱投入生产，一九五三年的收益将是很可观的；可是黄厚胜并不这样做。他拿着几百万元放在口袋里，随便花钱，就这样几百万元浪费得剩下不多了。这时候，有一个小贩名叫朱胜来找他去做生意。他们合股到番禺去贩运杨桃。连贩了五次，共总赔了六十万元。他俩互相埋怨了一会儿，散了伙。黄厚胜回家和老婆吵了一顿，心里还不服气，总觉得做生意比农业生产合算，于是又和他的老相识——二流子罗华珠合资五十万元，到中山县小杭镇贩运鸡鸭，三次又赔了三十万元。眼看“走鸡”生意做不成，又计划做贩运狗的生意，一次就赔了三十万元。这样一来，把生产搞糟了：鱼塘的鱼跑光了，稻田收成也坏了，没到过年就吃光了。
    一九五四年春耕时，黄厚胜家没有口粮，靠贷款和预购定金，才勉强敷衍过去。他总想占便宜，春耕时自己不播种，想到插秧时去买人家剩下的秧苗；谁料大家精打细算，谁家也没有秧苗剩下。春耕过了，人家的稻田长出了茁壮的禾苗，他的稻田却长着青草；直到立夏，他才把晚稻秧苗插下去。人家一年收两造，他只收一造；人家一亩田打五百斤谷，他只收三百斤，连甘蔗收成加起来，收入不过二百多万元，除了还贷款，还不够生活。——这正是黄厚胜走错路的结果。
    我们乡里的翻身农民薛骚九，他走的路却和黄厚胜不一样。薛骚九和黄厚胜一样分到斗争果实，但薛骚九把果实投入了扩大生产，又参加互助组，解决了劳动力的困难。因此，他的生产不断提高，生活不断上升。
    薛骚九一家九口人，劳动力不比黄厚胜强；他有六个小孩子，一个老父亲，只有他和老婆两个人劳动。薛骚九还在乡担任工作，全家实有一个半劳动力。土地改革时，他分到十三亩稻田、鱼塘、蔗田。四百万元退租钱加上原耕的收入，一共六百多万元，都投到一九五三年的农业生产上去了。这一年，他的蔗田和稻田的收入，就有一千三百多万元。他留下一九五四年的生产投资还给大人、小孩做了十三套衣服、两条棉被，喂了五头猪；剩下的钱存入银行七十万元，买公债三十万元，还剩下三十多万元借给他带头组织起来的互助组的组员了。
    一九五四年的收成不如上一年，但细算起来，总收入还是和上一年差不多，也有一千万元左右。一九五四年他收入的钱是这样支配的：除去农业税、水利费、口粮共二百八十余万元外，他又在生产合作社里投资三百六十万元，偿还预购款四十二万元，剩下就留做家里杂用。他的收入大部用来投到生产上去，这正是他的生活越来越富裕的重要原因之一。
