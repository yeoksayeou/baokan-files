The Dongting Lake construction site in Hunan Province is vigorously carrying out a labor emulation campaign. On January 2nd, fine rain mixed with snowflakes fell continuously, and the construction site was covered with a thick layer of ice. More than 2,000 laborers from the Sixth Brigade of the Second General Team of Hanshou in the West Dongting Lake area braved the severe cold and wind and snow. With a transport distance of 95 meters, they averaged 4.39 cubic meters of earth per person, creating the highest record for a large team unit in the entire work area. Chen Guomin's team from the Yuanjiang First General Team in the Datong Lake area improved the soil dumping method. On January 6th, they dug soil at a distance of 100 meters, creating a new record with an average work efficiency of 13.3 cubic meters.

Since the Xiangtan Special District Lake Management construction site launched a surprise competition campaign on December 28th of last year, as of January 10th, the entire district had completed 94 percent of the earthwork task, and it is now nearing complete construction.

Of the 26 million cubic meters of earthwork in the people-managed embankment self-repair project, more than 8 million cubic meters have been completed, accounting for 38.4 percent of the total earthwork task. After the Anxiang laborers finished repairing their own embankments, 6,000 laborers were transferred to support the gap-closing project in the key construction area of Haozi Port.

    洞庭湖治理工程紧张进行
    湖南省洞庭湖工地上，正在热烈地开展着劳动竞赛运动。一月二日，细雨裹着雪花，下个不停，工地上结着厚厚的冰层，西洞庭湖区的汉寿二总队六大队的两千多个民工，冒着奇寒和风雪，在九十五公尺的运输距离内，平均每人挑土四点三九方，首创全工区大队单位的最高纪录。大通湖区沅江一总队陈国民小组，改进倒土方法，一月六日，在一百公尺运距上取土，创造了平均工效达十三点三方的新纪录。
    湘潭专区治湖工地自从去年十二月二十八日开展突击竞赛运动以来，到一月十日止，全区已完成土方任务百分之九十四，目前已将全部完工。
    两千六百多万土方的民垸自修工程部分，已完成了八百多万土方，占总土方任务的百分之三十八点四。安乡民工修完自己的堤垸后，已抽调了六千民工支援蒿子港的重点工区堵口工程。
