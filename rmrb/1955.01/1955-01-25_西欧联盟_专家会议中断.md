Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 22nd: TASS reported that the seven-nation expert meeting discussing "arms coordination" has been temporarily suspended. Most people have returned to their countries to report to their governments. According to the "International Forum" weekly, in fact, there is nothing to report, because the governments are well aware of the sharpness of the divisions caused by the French proposals. The weekly said that the interruption of the meeting was only to prevent the debate from further deteriorating, because further deterioration of the debate would undermine the chances of the Republic Senate approving the Paris Accords.

According to the weekly, the divisions are so serious that some believe it is appropriate to interrupt the expert meeting for as long as possible, "at least until after the Paris Accords are ratified."

The "International Forum" weekly concluded, "In any case, after being attacked, very little remains of the French plan... The representatives of other countries opposed the Italian representatives, effectively tearing up the French plan."

    “西欧联盟”专家会议中断
    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社巴黎二十二日讯：讨论“军备统筹”的七国专家会议已暂时中止。大多数人已返国向政府作报告。据“国际论坛”周刊说，事实上，并没有什么可报告，因为各国政府都十分清楚法国建议所引起的分歧的尖锐性。周刊说，会议的中断只是为了防止辩论进一步恶化，因为辩论的进一步恶化会破坏共和国参议院批准巴黎协定的机会。
    据周刊说，分歧是这样严重，有人认为尽可能长地中断专家会议是适宜的，“至少也要拖延到批准”巴黎协定之后。
    “国际论坛”周刊的结语说，“无论如何，在遭到抨击之后，法国计划剩下来的东西已经很少了……其他国家的代表反对意大利代表，实际上就是撕毁了法国的计划。”
