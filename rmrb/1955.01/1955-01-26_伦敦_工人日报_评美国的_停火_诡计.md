    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 25th: A London dispatch reports that the London "Daily Worker" commented on the so-called American "ceasefire" proposal in an editorial on the 22nd, writing: "Naturally, any proposal that helps ease war tensions would be welcome. But this is not such a proposal. Because the United States is now effectively asking the People's China to agree to its occupation of Taiwan."

    The "Daily Worker" said that after Chiang Kai-shek's defeat, American imperialism pondered how best to restore its lost position, "Therefore, after the outbreak of the Korean War, the United States immediately announced that it would neutralize Taiwan and prevent the People's China from taking Taiwan. At first, they pretended to stop Chiang Kai-shek from attacking the mainland, but a year ago, 'they removed the mask', encouraged Chiang Kai-shek to launch an attack on the mainland, and supplied him with a large amount of war material to enable him to do so. The United States may recognize that this policy has failed. But they cannot expect the People's Republic of China to agree to a ceasefire that leaves Taiwan under the control of the United States and Chiang Kai-shek."

    The "Daily Worker" concluded, "If the United States withdraws its armed forces from Taiwan and allows Taiwan to return to China, then not only can a ceasefire be achieved, but there can also be peace in the Far East."

    伦敦“工人日报”评美国的“停火”诡计
    【新华社柏林二十五日电】伦敦消息：伦敦“工人日报”在二十二日社论中评论所谓美国的“停火”建议时写道：“自然，任何有助于缓和战争紧张局势的建议都是会受到欢迎的。但是这不是这样一种建议。因为美国现在实际上是要人民中国同意它霸占台湾。”
    “工人日报”说，在蒋介石失败以后，美帝国主义就盘算怎样能最好地恢复它失去的地位，“因此在朝鲜战争爆发以后，美国立即宣布，他们将使台湾中立化，而阻止人民中国拿下台湾。起先，他们假装要制止蒋介石进攻大陆，但是在一年以前，‘他们除去了假面具’，鼓励蒋介石着手进攻大陆，并且供应他大量的战争物资使他能这样做。美国也许认识到这种政策已经破产。但是他们不能指望中华人民共和国会同意一种使台湾受美国和蒋介石控制的停
    火。”
    “工人日报”最后说，“如果美国把他们的武装部队撤出台湾，让台湾重新归中国，那末不但停火能够实现，而且远东也能够有和平。”
