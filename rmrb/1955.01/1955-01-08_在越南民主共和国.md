    In the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
    Commemorating the Anniversary of the Founding of the Indochinese Communist Party
    The sixth of January was the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Indochinese Communist Party. The "People's Daily," the organ of the Vietnam Workers' Party, published an editorial on the 6th to commemorate this day.
    The "People's Daily" said: January 6, 1930, marked a new stage in the Vietnamese revolution. This day is closely related to the fate of all Vietnamese people because it is the founding day of the Indochinese Communist Party, the predecessor of the Vietnam Workers' Party.
    The "People's Daily" reviewed the history of the Indochinese Communist Party's struggle, and then pointed out: The party of the working class and working people—the Vietnam Workers' Party—continues the glorious mission of the Indochinese Communist Party, continues to hold high the banner of independence and democracy, enabled the War of Resistance to achieve victory, and is leading the Vietnamese people to struggle for peace, unification, independence, and democracy.
    The "People's Daily" said: The Vietnamese people's revolutionary struggle is still a long and arduous one, because enemies at home and abroad are trying their best to realize their conspiracy to undermine the victories that the Vietnamese people have achieved after many years of arduous struggle. The "People's Daily" condemned U.S. imperialism for interfering in Vietnam, attempting to undermine the armistice agreement, and turning South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos into aggressive military bases; and condemned the Ngo Dinh Diem clique for infringing upon the lives, property, and democratic rights of the South Vietnamese people, and acting as an aggressive tool of U.S. imperialism.
    The "People's Daily" pointed out: The main task of the Vietnam Workers' Party at present is to broadly unite all the people, consolidate and expand the Vietnam National United Front, isolate and defeat U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, in order to consolidate peace, complete unification, and realize independence and democracy throughout the country. The "People's Daily" expressed its firm belief that the Vietnamese people's struggle will surely be victorious.
    
    Representatives of Industry and Commerce Gather
    Two hundred and fifty representatives of industry and commerce from Hanoi and other cities held a meeting in Hanoi on January 3. The representatives exchanged views on the government's industrial and commercial policies, their role in economic recovery, and the direction of operating enterprises under the new national situation.
    All the delegates unanimously adopted the proposal made by Nguyen Son Ha, a famous Vietnamese industrialist, to write a letter to President Ho Chi Minh to offer New Year greetings. The congratulatory letter stated that they fully trusted the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, would study the government's industrial and commercial policies, and do their best to restore industry and commerce and develop enterprises, so as to contribute to the restoration and establishment of the country's independent economy.
    Phan Anh, Minister of Industry and Commerce of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and his deputy Dang Viet Chau, explained to the representatives at the meeting the government's industrial and commercial policies, the current situation of Vietnamese industry and commerce, and their role in prospering the national economy. In their speeches, they emphasized that the colonial rights that once ravaged the national economy have been eliminated in the area north of the 17th parallel, and the purchasing power of millions of liberated farmers is increasing day by day due to rent reduction and land reform, which have created fundamental favorable conditions for the recovery and development of industry and commerce.
    All the representatives attending the meeting were deeply moved by the government's concern for the national bourgeoisie.
    
    Reopening of Hanoi Overseas Chinese Zhonghua Middle School
    Hanoi Overseas Chinese Zhonghua Middle School reopened on the 6th and will officially start classes soon.
    Before the liberation of Hanoi, Zhonghua Middle School was forced to suspend classes due to the looting by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. After liberation, with the direct assistance of the Consular Department of our country's embassy in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Overseas Chinese in Hanoi established a preparatory committee for the reopening of the school to carry out work such as repairing classrooms, purchasing equipment, and enrolling students. More than 480 students have registered, which is more than any period before the liberation of Hanoi, and some of them came from Haiphong, where the French troops have not yet withdrawn, to study.
    On the 6th, Zhonghua Middle School held a reopening ceremony. Overseas Chinese representatives and teacher and student representatives of the reopening preparatory committee spoke at the meeting. They unanimously expressed their warm gratitude to the people, government, and Chairman Mao of the motherland for their kind concern and assistance, thanked the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for its enthusiastic support, and expressed their determination to run the school well.

    在越南民主共和国
    纪念印度支那共产党成立日
    一月六日是印度支那共产党成立二十五周年纪念日，越南劳动党机关报“人民报”六日发表社论纪念这一天。
      “人民报”说：一九三零年一月六日，越南革命进入了一个新的阶段。这一天和全体越南人民的命运紧密相关，因为这是越南劳动党的前身印度支那共产党的成立日。
      “人民报”回顾了印度支那共产党的斗争历史，接着指出：工人阶级和劳动人民的政党——越南劳动党继续着印度支那共产党的光荣任务，继续高举着独立和民主的旗帜，使抗战取得胜利，并且正领导着越南人民为和平、统一、独立和民主而斗争。
      “人民报”说：越南人民的革命斗争仍旧是长期和艰苦的，因为国内外的敌人正竭力要实现他们的阴谋，来破坏越南人民经过许多年的艰苦斗争才取得的胜利。“人民报”谴责美帝国主义干涉越南，企图破坏停战协定，变南越、柬埔寨、老挝为侵略军事基地；并谴责吴庭艳集团侵犯南越人民的生命、财产和民主权利，作美帝国主义者的侵略工具。
    “人民报”指出：越南劳动党目前的主要任务是广泛地团结全体人民，巩固和扩大越南国民联合战线，孤立和击败美帝国主义和它的仆从，以便巩固和平，完成统一，在全国实现独立和民主。“人民报”表示坚信越南人民的斗争一定会取得胜利。
    工商界代表集会
    河内和其他城市的工商界代表二百五十人，一月三日在河内举行会议。代表们就政府的工商业政策、他们在经济恢复中的作用以及在国家新形势下经营企业的方向交换了意见。
    全体与会代表一致通过越南著名工业家阮山河提出的建议，写信向胡志明主席贺年。贺年信中表示他们完全信任胡志明主席的领导，要学习政府的工商业政策，尽全力恢复工商业和发展企业，以便对恢复和建立国家的独立经济有所贡献。
    越南民主共和国工商部长潘英、副部长邓曰州，在会上分别向代表们说明政府的工商业政策、越南工商界目前的情况以及它们在繁荣国家经济中的作用。他们在讲话中着重指出，从前摧残民族经济的殖民权在十七纬度线以北地区已被清除，千百万解放了的农民的购买力由于进行减租和土地改革而日益提高，这些都给工商业的恢复和发展造成根本的有利条件。
    出席会议的全体代表对政府对民族资产阶级的关怀很是感动。
    河内华侨中华中学复校开学
    河内华侨中华中学已在六日复校开学，近日即将正式上课。
    河内解放以前，中华中学由于蒋贼分子的抢劫而被迫停课。解放后，在我国驻越南民主共和国大使馆领事部的直接帮助下，河内华侨成立了复校筹备委员会，进行修缮课室、购置用具和招生等工作。报名的学生已达四百八十多人，比河内解放前任何时期都多，其中有些学生是从法军尚未撤退的海防赶来学习的。
    六日，中华中学举行了复校开学典礼，复校筹备委员会的华侨代表和师生代表都在会上讲话，他们一致热烈感谢祖国人民、政府和毛主席给予的亲切关怀和帮助，感谢越南民主共和国政府给予的热心的支持，并表示决心把学校办好。（据新华社讯）
