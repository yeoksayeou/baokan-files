    The Ministry of Forestry recently convened a National Forestry Conference. Based on the forestry construction situation in 1954, the conference proposed the central tasks for forestry construction in the next three years.

    The conference believes that China's forestry construction work made significant improvements in 1954. Party organizations and governments in many regions have further emphasized forestry work, strengthened afforestation, silviculture, and forest fire prevention, thereby completing the afforestation and silviculture tasks for 1954. Grassroots forest fire prevention organizations have been established in various regions, significantly reducing fire incidents compared to previous years. The area of young trees destroyed by fire in 1954 was approximately 30% of that in 1953. In the state-owned forest areas of Northeast China and Inner Mongolia, there were basically no fires in the autumn of last year. The mutual aid and cooperation movement in forestry has also developed. According to incomplete statistics, more than 98,000 various types of forestry mutual aid and cooperation organizations have been established in fifteen provinces, including Shandong and Shaanxi. In most provinces, mutual aid and cooperation in afforestation accounted for more than 70%. In 1954, twenty provinces conducted forestry zoning work, identified many key counties and townships, and formulated forestry production plans for mountainous areas. In 1954, China's forestry survey teams grew stronger, surveying vast forests and suitable afforestation land across the country, and trained aerial surveying personnel with the help of the Soviet aerial surveying team. The forest management plan for Changbai Mountain has been formulated, and the planned management of the forest has begun.

    The conference pointed out that although China's forestry construction has achieved many successes, the timber supply still lags far behind the needs of national economic construction. In many areas, vast farmlands suffer severe disasters due to soil erosion caused by the lack of forest cover in mountainous areas. Therefore, it is necessary to take a long-term perspective, conduct forest surveys, and rationally manage existing forests. At the same time, afforestation plans should be formulated and afforestation carried out in a planned manner.

    Regarding forestry construction in the next three years, the conference determined: First, continue to carry out forestry zoning and mountainous area production planning, and unify forestry planning with the planning of agriculture, animal husbandry, and water conservancy construction in mountainous areas. This work should be basically completed within three years in areas where developing forestry and developing mountainous area production are of significant importance. Second, determine key forestry construction projects through national planning and design, and begin construction. While carrying out key construction projects, leadership over forestry operations in general areas should not be abandoned. Only in this way can the forestry operations in various regions have clear goals, carry out work according to plan, and concentrate manpower, materials, and financial resources to ensure that the expected goals are achieved within a certain period. The demonstrative effect of key construction can also drive the development of comprehensive forestry operations. Third, incorporate forestry production into the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement. The conference pointed out that relying on mutual aid and cooperation is a fundamental issue in forestry construction. Forestry departments should actively participate in the mutual aid and cooperation work led by the Party committees, and provide effective assistance to mutual aid and cooperation organizations in terms of technology, seedlings, training forestry cooperative accountants, and formulating forestry production plans.

    The conference also discussed the 1955 production plan and issues such as improving the leadership of forestry work.

    全国林业会议提出林业建设中心工作
    林业部最近召开了全国林业会议，根据一九五四年的林业建设情况，提出了今后三年林业建设的中心工作。
    会议认为，我国林业建设工作在一九五四年有了重大的改进。许多地方的党组织和政府，对林业工作进一步重视起来，加强了造林、育林和护林防火等工作，因而完成了一九五四年的造林、育林任务。各地都建立了基层护林防火组织，使火灾比往年大大减少。一九五四年烧毁的幼树约为一九五三年的百分之三十。东北、内蒙国有林区去年秋天基本上没有发生火灾。林业互助合作运动也有了发展，据不完全统计，山东、陕西等十五个省建立了各种类型的林业互助合作组织九万八千多个，互助合作造林所占比重，在大多数省份都在百分之七十以上。一九五四年，有二十个省进行了林业区划工作，并确定了许多重点县和重点乡，制定了山区林业生产计划。在一九五四年我国林业调查队伍已经更加壮大，调查了祖国大片的森林和宜林地，并在苏联航测队的帮助下，训练了航测人材。长白山森林经营施业案已经制定，开始了有计划地经营管理森林。
    会议指出，我国林业建设虽然取得了不少成绩，但是木材供应还远落在国家经济建设需要的后面。还有许多地方的广大农田因山地缺乏森林覆被，水土流失，受到严重灾害。所以必须从长期着眼，对森林进行调查，合理地经营管理现有森林。同时制订造林计划，有计划地进行造林。
    对于今后三年的林业建设，会议确定：第一，继续进行林业区划和山区生产规划工作，把林业规划和山区农业、牧业及水利建设的规划，统一进行。在当前发展林业和发展山区生产有重要意义的地区，要在三年内基本上完成这一工作。第二，经过国家规划设计，确定林业重点建设的项目，并开始施工。在进行重点建设时，不应放弃对一般地区营林工作的领导。只有这样，才能使各个地区营林事业有明确的奋斗目标，按计划、集中人力、物力、财力进行工作，保证在一定时期内达到预期目的。通过重点建设的示范作用，并可带动全面营林工作的开展。第三，把林业生产纳入农村互助合作运动的轨道上去。会议指出，依靠互助合作是林业建设工作中带有根本性的问题，林业部门要积极参加党委领导的互助合作工作，并在技术上、种苗上、训练林业合作社会计及制定林业生产计划等方面，给予互助合作组织以有效的帮助。
    会议还讨论了一九五五年的生产计划及改善林业工作的领导等问题。
