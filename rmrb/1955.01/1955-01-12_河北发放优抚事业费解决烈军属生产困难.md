In 1954, Hebei Province distributed a total of over 280 billion yuan in preferential treatment funds. After Ling Shou, Qing Yun, Yi Xian, Lai Yuan, and Lai Shui counties, and two other counties distributed preferential treatment funds, they helped more than 3,700 families of martyrs and soldiers to buy more than 1,500 head of draft animals, more than 3,400 sheep, and many plows, weeding hoes, carts, and other farm implements.

After solving the difficulties in production, the families of martyrs, families of soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers enthusiastically participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations. According to statistics from 256 townships in six counties, including Ji Xian, Ping Shan, and Zheng Ding, and An Ping, Shen Ze, and Lai Shui, 35,912 households participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, accounting for 61.6 percent of the total number of local families of martyrs, families of soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers. Lu Jinchang, a disabled revolutionary soldier in Mengchang Village, Li County, led ten families of martyrs and soldiers to organize a production cooperative for weaving willow products, earning 500,000 yuan in twenty days; he also organized the male and female members of the cooperative to actively participate in agricultural labor.

    河北发放优抚事业费解决烈军属生产困难
    河北省各级人民政府发放优抚事业费帮助革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人解决生产和生活中的困难，并鼓励他们参加互助合作组织。
    一九五四年河北省共发放优抚事业费二千八百多亿元。灵寿、庆云、易县、涞源、涞水等七县发放了优抚事业费以后，曾帮助三千七百多户烈属和军属等买了耕畜一千五百多头，羊三千四百多只，还有很多步犁、耘锄、土车等农具。
    烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人在解决了生产中的困难后，热情地参加了互助合作组织。据冀县、平山、正定等六县和安平、深泽、涞水的二百五十六个乡统计，参加互助合作组织的有三万五千九百十二户，占当地烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人总户数的百分之六十一点六。蠡县孟尝村革命残废军人吕金畅，领导十户烈属、军属组织了一个编柳条用具的生产合作社，二十天时间便收入五十万元；他还组织社里的男女社员积极参加农业劳动。
