Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 10th -- In the unified purchase of grain, cotton, and oilseeds, the Chinese Communist Party organizations at all levels in Henan Province paid attention to educating peasants on obeying national plans, which improved peasants’ awareness of arranging production and consumption according to national plans.

In the unified purchase work, the CCP committees of most counties in Henan Province convened meetings of county, district, and township level cadres and representatives of Party propagandists. A total of 300,000 propaganda backbones received education and training throughout the province. Various localities, in conjunction with summarizing production, used oral propaganda, material exhibitions, and detailed accounting methods to carry out propaganda on the importance of obeying national plans to the peasants, which raised the awareness of peasants in many areas. For example, the peasants of Yuandian Township, Shan County, which mainly grows cotton, calculated such an account at a mass meeting in the township: Before liberation, most five-member households in this township generally had only one or two quilts; now, on average, each peasant household member has one quilt. The consumption of cotton cloth and cotton has increased several times compared to the past, but cotton production has only increased by more than 80 percent. The peasants all said: The peasants in the grain-producing areas supply us with food, how can we use up all the cotton we produce? Many peasants voluntarily proposed to save cotton and sell more cotton to the state.

Some members of the No. 1 Agricultural Production Cooperative of Zhaozhuang Township, Tanghe County, originally had opinions on the state's quota supply of edible oil. They said: We produce sesame here, why doesn't the state let us eat as much oil as we want? Later, the peasants also did an accounting: Now, the oil consumed by each household is one to two times more than before liberation, while sesame production has only increased by 20 to 30 percent compared to before liberation. Last spring, profiteers speculated, and the price of edible oil rose to more than 10,000 yuan per jin; now, the edible oil supplied by the supply and marketing cooperative is only 4,000 yuan per jin, and the quantity supplied is not less than the average consumption of the entire village in the past. The co-op members all realized: It is still better for the state to be in charge. The entire co-op sold all the sesame harvested this year to the state, except for the seeds and self-use portions left according to regulations.

Through extensive and meticulous education, the peasants' awareness of obeying national plans has been raised. The members of the Lichang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Beicheng Township, Huixian County, originally planned to keep more than 2,000 jin of seed cotton for their own use. After careful calculation, they sold the excess of more than 1,300 jin of seed cotton to the state. In Anyang, Xinxiang, and other places, many peasants who used to feed livestock with cottonseed in winter now voluntarily sell the cottonseed to the state in exchange for cottonseed cake as feed. Many peasants in non-oilseed crop producing areas are preparing to use the edges of fields and yards to plant oilseed crops this year. Many mutual aid and cooperative organizations have formulated plans, and the peasants will strive to increase production of more grain, cotton, and oilseeds this year to sell to the state.

    中共河南省各级组织在粮棉统购中
    教育农民按照国家计划安排生产和消费
    【新华社郑州十日电】　在粮食、棉花、油料的统购中，中国共产党河南省各级组织注意向农民进行服从国家计划的教育，提高了农民按照国家计划安排生产和消费的自觉性。
    在统购工作中，河南省绝大部分县的中共委员会都召开了县、区、乡三级干部会和党的宣传员代表会，全省受到教育和训练的宣传骨干共有三十万人。各地结合总结生产，运用口头宣传、实物展览和算细账的办法，向农民展开了服从国家计划的重要性的宣传，使不少地区的农民提高了觉悟。以植棉为主的陕县原店乡农民在全乡群众大会上算了这样一笔账：解放以前，这乡绝大部分五口之家的农户，一般只有一条到两条被子；如今，一般农户每个人平均可有一条被子。全乡棉布和棉花的消费量比过去增长了几倍，但棉花生产量却只增加百分之八十多。农民们都说：产粮区农民供应咱吃粮，咱们怎能把自己增产的棉花都用完？很多农民自动提出要节约用棉，把更多的棉花卖给国家。
    唐河县赵庄乡第一农业生产合作社有些社员本来对国家定量供应食油有意见，他们说：咱们这里出芝麻，为啥国家不让咱尽量吃油？后来农民也算了一笔账：现在各家吃用的油都比解放以前增加了一倍到两倍，而芝麻产量却只比解放前增加了两三成。去年春天，这里奸商投机倒把，每斤食油价钱涨到一万多元；现在，供销合作社供应的食油每斤价只四千元，而且供应的数量并不比过去全村平均消费量少。社员们都认识了：到底还是国家当家好。全社把今年收的芝麻，除了按照规定留下种籽和自用部分外，其余全都卖给了国家。
    经过广泛的和细致的教育，农民们服从国家计划的思想提高了。辉县北城乡李常农业生产合作社的社员，本来打算留下两千多斤籽棉自用，经过仔细计算以后，把多余的一千三百多斤籽棉卖给了国家。安阳、新乡等地不少农民过去习惯在冬季用棉籽喂牲口，现在都自动把棉籽卖给国家，换回棉饼作饲料。许多非油料作物产区的农民，正准备在今年利用地边、场园种植油料作物。许多互助合作组织已制订出计划，农民们要争取今年增产更多的粮食、棉花、油料卖给国家。
