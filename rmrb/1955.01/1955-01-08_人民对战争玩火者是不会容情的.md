    American generals are increasingly fond of brandishing atomic weapons lately. People had just heard Stevenson, commander of the U.S. 49th Air Division stationed in Britain, advocating for an atomic war against the Soviet Union in Western Europe. Barely twenty days later, Radford, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, was clamoring in the Far East about using atomic weapons against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China.

    Radford said upon arriving in Seoul on January 2 that if the Korean War were to restart, the United States would use atomic weapons. One must ask, who exactly is trying to restart the Korean War? Syngman Rhee, who has been shouting for "northward unification," and the American generals who are working hard to expand and strengthen Syngman Rhee's army, have already answered this question. Therefore, Radford's words actually indicate that he himself wants to encourage Syngman Rhee's "northward unification" by clamoring for atomic war.

    The fact that American generals are clamoring for the use of atomic weapons in the East and West is obviously an attempt to use intimidation and threats to force the world to submit to America's war policy. They are trying to make people feel that only by allowing the United States to run rampant in the world is it possible to avoid an atomic war, and that only by following the United States is it possible to prevent America's atomic weapons from falling on their own heads. The fact is, of course, not like this. The fact is that only by opposing America's war policy of running rampant can peace be defended.

    Since the American aggressive bloc regards atomic weapons as an important tool for carrying out aggression throughout the world, it is no wonder that it has not said a word about the Soviet Union's proposal to ban the manufacture and use of atomic weapons.

    But it is a waste of effort for American generals to try to intimidate the people of the Soviet Union, China, Korea, and the various People's Democratic countries with atomic weapons. Atomic weapons are no longer the monopoly patent of the United States. People know that atomic weapons are more destructive to a highly industrialized and densely populated country. It is obvious that if the United States dares to launch an atomic war, what it will bring to the United States is not sweetness, but great suffering.

    When Radford urged Japan to rearm in Japan, he should have gone to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which had suffered from American atomic bomb attacks, and he should also have gone to see the more than twenty Japanese fishermen who were harmed by American hydrogen bomb tests. This may give Radford some impression of the consequences for the United States if the United States were to launch an atomic war. Radford should know that the Japanese people, the Asian people, and the people of the world are not living to be victims of American atomic weapons. The American generals' use of bankrupt atomic blackmail to intimidate the world and provoke war can only arouse greater anger and opposition from peace-loving people around the world. The people will not forgive warmongers.

    人民对战争玩火者是不会容情的
    新华社评论员  江南
    美国将军们最近越来越喜欢挥舞原子武器了。人们刚刚听过驻扎在英国的美国第四十九空军师师长史蒂文森在西欧鼓吹对苏联进行原子战争，隔了才二十多天，美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福又在远东叫嚣要对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国使用原子武器了。
    雷德福在一月二日到达汉城的时候说，如果朝鲜战争再起，美国将使用原子武器。人们要问，究竟是谁在想使朝鲜战争重起呢？一直叫嚷
  “北进统一”的李承晚和正在竭力扩大和加强李承晚军队的美国将军们早已对这个问题作出了答案。因此，雷德福的话实际上表明，就是他自己想用叫嚣原子战争来鼓励李承晚“北进统一”。
    美国将军们这样在东方和西方叫嚷使用原子武器，显然是企图利用恫吓和威胁的手段来强迫全世界屈从于美国的战争政策。他们企图使人觉得，只有听任美国在全世界横行霸道，才有可能避免一场原子战争，只有追随美国，才有可能使美国的原子武器不至于落在自己头上。事实当然不是这样的。事实是，只有反对美国横行霸道的战争政策，才能保卫和平。
    美国侵略集团既然把原子武器作为它在全世界进行侵略的重要工具，无怪乎它对于苏联提出的禁止制造和使用原子武器的建议一声不吭了。
    但是美国将军们要想用原子武器来恫吓苏联、中国、朝鲜和各人民民主国家的人民，那却是在白费气力。原子武器早已不是美国垄断的专利品。人们知道，原子武器对一个高度工业化的、人口集中的国家破坏性更大，很明显，美国如果敢于发动原子战争，给美国带来的决不是什么甜头，而是大大的苦头。
    雷德福在日本催促日本重新武装时，他应该到曾经遭受过美国原子弹轰炸的广岛和长崎去看看，他还应当去看看被美国氢弹试验伤害的二十多名日本渔民。这也许会使雷德福对于美国发动原子战争对美国的后果获得一些印象。雷德福应当知道，日本人民、亚洲人民和全世界人民并不是为了做美国原子武器的牺牲品而活着的。美国将军们用破产了的原子讹诈来恫吓全世界，挑拨战争，只能引起全世界爱好和平的人民更大的愤怒和反对。人民对战争玩火者是不会容情的。
