The first session of the Second Wuhan Municipal People's Congress was held from January 17th to 20th.

The meeting elected Song Kanfu as Mayor, and Liu Huinong, Chen Jingshu, Meng Futang, Wang Kewen, Tang Xing, Tang Wuyuan, Sun Yaohua, and Wei Tinghuai as Deputy Mayors by secret ballot. Wang Yiming and twenty-eight others were elected as members of the Municipal People's Committee.

The meeting heard the "Report on the Work of the Wuhan Municipal People's Government in 1954 and Suggestions for Future Work Tasks" delivered by Song Kanfu on behalf of the Municipal People's Government Committee. The delegates carefully and responsibly reviewed the government's work, and raised sharp criticisms regarding poor planning, low quality, and significant waste in basic construction; insufficient supply of certain materials in the material supply work due to inadequate planning; the inability of transportation work to meet construction needs; and poor traffic order. They urged the government to make improvements. The heads of relevant government departments also conducted self-criticism at the meeting. After discussion, the meeting unanimously clarified that this year's work task is to mobilize the people of the city to give play to their initiative and creativity, overcome difficulties to complete the national plan, and support the disaster areas, the countryside, and the liberation of Taiwan with practical actions to ensure the completion of the basic construction tasks undertaken by the state in the Wuhan area. The meeting also decided to organize a Wuhan People's 1955 Spring Festival慰问團 to offer condolences to the basic construction workers.

The meeting adopted the resolution on the "Report on the Work of the Wuhan Municipal People's Government in 1954 and Suggestions for Future Work Tasks," as well as a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao and a telegram of condolence to the People's Liberation Army and the Volunteer Army.
