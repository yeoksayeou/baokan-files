Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 15th: D. Kraminov published an article in "Pravda" commenting on Eisenhower's State of the Union Address.

Kraminov pointed out: When this U.S. government came to power, it promised voters peace and economic prosperity. Eisenhower had guaranteed to maintain a sound economy, curb the unemployment crisis, and reduce taxes. But in the two years since the president took office, the Republican leaders have fully exposed themselves as braggarts and liars. They have failed to prevent the gradual arrival of the crisis. The unemployment crisis looms over millions of workers and staff, while the threat of bankruptcy looms over farmers.

Kraminov said: Therefore, it is only natural that the American people are looking forward with great concern to the U.S. government's plans for the new year. Will the government continue to adhere to its original course, or will it adopt a new one? Will the government continue to increase military spending, or will it stop the destructive arms race? Will the government strive to ease international tensions, or will it, on the contrary, exacerbate them?

The State of the Union Address delivered by Eisenhower himself has provided an answer to these questions.

The drafters of the State of the Union Address said that U.S. foreign policy is based on the principle of "peace through strength." They have rehashed the fabrications of the U.S. propaganda machine about the "Soviet threat" and the "ambitions of the communist bloc" and demanded further expansion and acceleration of the arms race -- which U.S. monopoly capital believes is the only way to prevent the inevitable economic crisis. The address also calls on Congress to implement so-called "important measures" to crush the working people's last hope of alleviating the burden of taxes.

The U.S. government complacently praises the system of military alliances and blocs directed against freedom-loving people of all countries. This policy has increased the profits of the U.S. war industry monopoly capital to an unprecedented extent, but it has not improved the international standing of the United States. The military treaties and agreements that the United States has concluded with the governments of the countries that rely on it have made the people of these countries more opposed to Washington's aggressive policies.

Kraminov said: However, ignoring logic and common sense, the American rulers have not only not abandoned their bankrupt political policies, but are intensifying them.

They are clearly attempting to break the deadlock in international affairs by engaging in irresponsible adventures. They have decided to "supplement" the policy of establishing military blocs and engaging in the arms race with plans to prepare for atomic war. In addition to the blatant hints about preparing to use atomic weapons in the address, there is the even more straightforward statement: "We must continue to improve and expand our supply of nuclear weapons for the Army, Navy, and Air Force."

The plans of the American aggressors are truly exposed! All their calculations are based on the widespread use of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

Kraminov concluded: It is quite obvious that the clamor about atomic weapons is to carry out extortion -- to intimidate the people of the world with America's "strength." But everyone knows that the U.S. rulers are clamoring so loudly precisely to cover up their fear of the powerful and unstoppable surge of the world's anti-imperialist and peace-loving forces, and to cover up the fact that they have no power to stop the inevitable development of history, and cannot even overcome their extremely unstable economic situation, the distrust of their Western European allies, and the growing hostility of people of all countries (including the American people) to their policies.

### 美国侵略分子继续叫嚣原子战争进行敲诈——“真理报”载文评论艾森豪威尔的国情咨文

    美国侵略分子继续叫嚣原子战争进行敲诈
    ——“真理报”载文评论艾森豪威尔的国情咨文
    【新华社讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十五日讯：德·克拉米诺夫在“真理报”上发表文章，评论艾森豪威尔的国情咨文。
    克拉米诺夫指出：美国的这一届政府上台的时候曾经答应要给选民和平和经济繁荣。艾森豪威尔曾经保证要维持健全的经济，制止失业危机和减低赋税。但是在总统上台以后的两年中，共和党的领袖们已经充分暴露了他们自己的吹牛家和骗子的真面目。他们没有能够阻止危机逐渐到来。失业危机笼罩着千百万工人和职员，同时破产的威胁笼罩着农民。
    克拉米诺夫说：因此，美国的人们抱着非常关切的心情期待美国政府新的一年的计划，原是很自然的事。政府将来究竟是坚持原来的方针呢，还是采取新的方针？政府究竟是继续增加军费负担呢，还是停止破坏性的扩张军备运动？政府究竟要努力来缓和国际紧张局势呢，还是相反地使国际紧张局势加剧？
    艾森豪威尔本人宣读的国情咨文已经为这些问题提出一个答案。
    国情咨文的草拟人说，美国的外交政策是以“通过实力取得和平”的原则为基础的。他们重新搬出美国的宣传机关关于“苏联的威胁”和“共产党集团的野心”的虚构，并且要求进一步扩展和加速扩张军备运动——美国垄断资本认为扩张军备运动是防止无法避免的经济危机的唯一办法。咨文还要求国会实行粉碎劳动人民关于减轻赋税重担的最后希望的所谓“重要措施”。
    美国政府洋洋得意地赞扬针对爱好自由的各国人民的军事联盟和集团的体系。这种政策使得美国战争工业垄断资本的利润增加到空前的程度，但是并没有使美国的国际地位有所提高。美国同依靠它的国家的政府所缔结的军事条约和协定，使得这些国家的人民更加反对华盛顿的侵略政策。
    克拉米诺夫说：但是，美国统治者无视逻辑和常理，不但没有放弃他们的已经破产了的政治方针，反而正在变本加厉地执行这种方针。
    他们显然企图用进行不负责任的冒险的办法，来打破国际事务的僵局。他们决定用准备原子战争的计划来“补充”建立军事集团和进行扩张军备运动的政策。咨文中除了关于准备使用原子武器的露骨的暗示以外，更加上了这样一句直言不讳的话：“我们必须继续改善和扩大我国陆、海、空军的核子武器的供应。”
    美国侵略分子的计划真是暴露无遗了！他们的一切算计都是以广泛使用原子武器和氢武器为基础的。
    克拉米诺夫最后说：十分明显，关于原子武器的叫嚣是为了进行敲诈——用美国的“实力”来恐吓世界各国的人民。可是大家知道，美国统治者这样大肆叫嚣，正是为了掩饰他们恐惧全世界反对帝国主义和爱好和平的力量的强有力的不可阻挡的高涨，为了掩饰这样一个事实：他们没有力量阻挡历史的必然的发展，甚至也不能够克服他们经济方面的极不稳定的局面，不能克服西欧盟国的不信任和各国人民（包括美国人民在内）对于他们政策的日益增长的敌视。（附图片）
