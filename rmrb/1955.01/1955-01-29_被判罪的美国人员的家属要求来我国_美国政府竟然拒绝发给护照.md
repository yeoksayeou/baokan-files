Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 28th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles wrote a letter on the 27th to the families of American personnel who have been convicted or are under investigation by the Chinese government, openly stating that these families are prohibited from visiting their relatives in China. In the letter, Dulles said that the U.S. government has decided to refuse "to issue passports to any American citizen to travel to Communist China," and said that doing so "is most in line with our (U.S.) interests."

After the Chinese government announced that it would provide humanitarian measures to facilitate visits to China by the families of these American personnel, some families happily expressed their desire to come to China as soon as possible. A U.S. State Department spokesman announced on the 25th that three families had inquired with the State Department on the 25th about obtaining passports to come to China. On the 24th, the State Department received two similar inquiries.

In his letter, Dulles hypocritically expressed sympathy and concern for these families, but in reality, he stifled their wishes. This shows that the U.S. government does not care about the convicted American personnel and their families at all, but uses the American spy case to create a tense atmosphere in order to cover up the U.S.'s war provocations against China.

    被判罪的美国人员的家属要求来我国
    美国政府竟然拒绝发给护照
    【新华社二十八日讯】华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯二十七日写信给已被中国政府判罪的和正在审查中的美国人员的家属，公然表示禁止这些家属来中国探访他们的亲人。杜勒斯在信中说，美国政府决定拒绝“发护照给任何美国公民到共产党中国去旅行”，并且说，这样做“才是最符合我国
  （美国）的利益”。
    在中国政府宣布提供这些美国人员的家属来中国探访以便利的人道措施后，若干家属曾高兴地表示要尽快到中国来。美国国务院发言人二十五日曾宣布，在二十五日有三个家属向国务院询问领护照来中国的情况。在二十四日，国务院还接到过两个同样的询问。
    杜勒斯在信里居然伪言对这些家属表示同情和关心，然而实际上却扼杀了这些家属的愿望。这就说明，美国政府一点也不关心被判罪的美国人员和他们的家属，而是用关心利用美国间谍案件来制造紧张空气，借以掩盖美国对中国的战争挑衅行动。
