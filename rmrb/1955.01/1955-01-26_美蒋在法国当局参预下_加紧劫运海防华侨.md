Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 23rd: According to recent news from Haiphong, the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, with the participation of French authorities, are intensifying the abduction and transport of overseas Chinese from Haiphong to South Vietnam.

The news said that when more than 3,000 overseas Chinese were forced onto the American transport ship "General Heintzelman" bound for Saigon on the 13th, Collins, the US Special Envoy to South Vietnam who was active in Haiphong at the time, personally inspected the port. On the 14th, the French ship "Ville de Haiphong" abducted and transported more than 2,000 overseas Chinese to Saigon. On the 15th, the French ship "Ville de Saigon" abducted approximately 2,000 overseas Chinese southward, and another southward-bound French merchant ship, the "Grand Verville," also carried a portion of the abducted overseas Chinese. The news said that in order to abduct and transport the overseas Chinese to South Vietnam, the US imperialists, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and the French colonial elements carried out all kinds of intimidation and threats against the overseas Chinese.

The news also said that the overseas Chinese who were abducted to South Vietnam have fallen into a very miserable situation. Due to the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's reign of terror, many overseas Chinese can only vaguely hint at the tragic situation of their current lives in letters to relatives and friends in the north. Some draw a hanging rope in their letters, some draw a bloody knife or a broken bowl, and some write the words "difficult," "bitter," or "painful." These kinds of letters are circulating among the overseas Chinese in Haiphong.

    美蒋在法国当局参预下
    加紧劫运海防华侨
    【新华社河内二十三日电】据最近来自海防的消息说，美国和蒋介石卖国集团在法国当局的参与下正在加紧把海防的华侨劫运到南越去。
    消息说，十三日当三千多名华侨被赶上美国运输舰“豪斯将军”号运往西贡时，当时在海防活动的美国驻南越特使柯林斯曾经亲自到港口视察。十四日，法国轮船“海防市”号劫运两千多名华侨驶往西贡。十五日，法国轮船
  “西贡市”号劫运华侨约两千人南驶，另一艘南驶的法国商轮“大五粒星”号上也载着一部分被劫运的华侨。消息说，为了把华侨劫运到南越去，美帝国主义者、蒋介石卖国集团和法国殖民分子对华侨进行了种种的恫吓和威胁。
    消息还说，被劫运到南越的华侨已陷入十分悲惨的境地。由于吴庭艳集团的恐怖统治，很多华侨在给北部亲友的信中只能隐约地暗示他们目前生活的悲惨状况。他们有的在信中画一条吊颈的绳子，有的画一把血刀或者破了的饭碗，有的写一个“难”、“苦”或“痛”字。这种信在海防华侨中间流传着。
