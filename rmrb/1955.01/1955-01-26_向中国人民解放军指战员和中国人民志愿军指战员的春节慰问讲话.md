Comrades Commanders and Fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army!

    The Spring Festival has arrived! As people of all our nationalities are happily and joyfully celebrating this traditional festival, we first think of you, because you are the sons and daughters of the Chinese people, a revolutionary army serving the people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and the most reliable force for safeguarding the security of the motherland and ensuring the smooth progress of socialist construction in the motherland. On behalf of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the people of the whole country, I extend warm Spring Festival greetings to you and express my cordial regards!

    Dear comrades! As we celebrate this year's Spring Festival, we will naturally recall the great achievements made by the people of the whole country in socialist construction and socialist transformation in 1954. These achievements encourage us to meet the new tasks of 1955 and give us the confidence to achieve even greater success in the construction cause of 1955. It is also these achievements that make our festival even more pleasant and happier. But, dear comrades, we have not forgotten that all these achievements are inseparable from your struggle to defend the security of the motherland and oppose enemies at home and abroad: it is you who vigilantly guard the border and coast of the motherland, monitoring the skies of the motherland; it is you who keep a watchful eye on the destructive activities of the enemy; it is you who guarantee the smooth progress of the socialist construction cause of the motherland.

    Dear comrades! We will also naturally recall that in 1954, the Chinese people, together with the great Soviet people and all peace-loving people in the world, also achieved great achievements in the struggle to defend world peace, oppose wars of aggression, and ease international tensions. The Chinese people and the people of the world are satisfied and happy with these achievements. However, the aggressive forces headed by US imperialism are very dissatisfied and unhappy with these achievements. In order to counter the victory of the forces of peace, they are desperately struggling to revive German militarism in Europe and piece together aggressive forces in Asia with all their might. US imperialism, moreover, has invaded and occupied China's territory of Taiwan and expanded its aggressive actions and prepared for new wars by openly signing the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with Chiang Kai-shek, the public enemy of the Chinese people. The Chinese people must continue to work with the people of the world to resolutely fight to defend world peace, oppose wars of aggression, and ease world tensions. The Chinese people's struggle against the US-Chiang treaty and for the liberation of their own territory of Taiwan is an important part of the struggle to defend peace in the Far East and the world. It is hoped that you will continue to achieve greater victories after winning the great victory in the Battle of Yijiangshan Island. It is hoped that you will continue to strengthen military and political training, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet army, strive to master modern combat art, carry forward revolutionary heroism, and resolutely fight for the final liberation of Taiwan, the defense of the security of the motherland, and world peace. In this struggle, all the people of China and the people of the world are with you. This struggle will surely be victorious.

    Dear commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who are still in Korea!

    When the people of the motherland celebrate the Spring Festival, they also think of you first. In order to support our close neighbor in resisting aggression and defending the security of their own motherland, you went abroad to fight and finally defeated the US aggressors and won the great victory of the Korean armistice. Now you continue to stay in Korea with the Korean People's Army and the Korean people, monitoring the enemy's conspiracy to re-launch the war, and assisting the Korean people in post-war reconstruction. The people of the whole country will continue to fully support you and support the Korean people in restoring and developing the national economy and striving for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

    Dear comrades commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army! Dear comrades commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army! Our country is still in a situation surrounded by capitalism. US imperialism has occupied our territory of Taiwan and continues to exacerbate international tensions, attempting to instigate new wars of aggression. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique constantly harasses our coastal areas. Therefore, the people of the whole country hope that you will raise your vigilance, step up training, continuously improve your military, political and cultural level, skillfully master modern military science and technology, and continue to carry forward the fine traditions of hard struggle, heroic sacrifice, close unity, observance of discipline, overcoming difficulties, and perseverance, and strive to build a fully modernized and powerful revolutionary army, and fight for the liberation of Taiwan, the elimination of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, the shattering of the US-Chiang treaty, the guarantee of the security of the motherland, and the guarantee of peace in the Far East and the world.

    I wish you a happy Spring Festival.

    向中国人民解放军指战员和中国人民志愿军指战员的春节慰问讲话
    中国共产党中央政冶局委员
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长
    林伯渠中国人民解放军全体指挥员、战斗员同志们！
    春节来到了！当我们各民族人民正在愉快地、幸福地度过这个传统的节日的时候，我们首先想到了你们，因为你们是中国人民的子弟兵，是在中国共产党领导下为人民服务的革命军队，是保卫祖国的安全、保卫祖国社会主义建设顺利进行的最可靠的力量。我代表中国共产党中央委员会和全国人民向你们热烈地祝贺春节，并且表示亲切的慰问！
    亲爱的同志们！当我们欢度今年春节的时候，我们很自然地就会回想起：在一九五四年，全国人民在社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业中所取得的伟大的成就。这些成就鼓舞着我们迎接一九五五年的新的任务，并且使我们有信心在一九五五年的建设事业中取得更大的成就。也正是这些成就使我们的节日显得更加愉快和更加幸福。但是，亲爱的同志们，我们一点也没有忘记，所有这些成就都是和你们保卫祖国安全、反对国内外敌人的每一个斗争分不开的：是你们警惕地守卫着祖国的边防、海防，监视着祖国的天空；是你们睁着警觉的眼睛，监视着敌人的破坏活动；是你们保障着祖国社会主义建设事业的顺利进行。
    亲爱的同志们！我们同样会很自然地回想起：在一九五四年，中国人民和伟大的苏联人民以及全世界所有爱好和平的人民一起，在保卫世界和平、反对侵略战争、和缓国际局势的斗争中，也取得了伟大的成就。中国人民和全世界人民都为这些成就而感到满意，感到高兴。可是，以美国帝国主义为首的侵略势力对于这些成就是很不满意、很不高兴的。他们为了对抗和平力量的胜利，正在拼命挣扎地用一切力量在欧洲复活德国军国主义，在亚洲拼凑侵略势力。美国帝国主义更用公然同中国人民的公敌蒋介石签订所谓“共同防御条约”的方式，侵占中国领土台湾，扩大侵略行动和准备新的战争。中国人民要继续同全世界人民一道，坚决为保卫世界和平、反对侵略战争、和缓世界紧张局势而斗争。中国人民反对美蒋条约、解放自己的领土台湾的斗争，是保卫远东和世界和平的斗争的一个重要部分。希望你们在取得一江山岛战斗的重大胜利之后继续取得更大的胜利。希望你们继续加强军事、政治训练，学习苏联军队的先进经验，努力掌握现代作战艺术，发扬革命英雄主义，为最后解放台湾、保卫祖国安全和世界和平而坚决斗争。在这个斗争中，全中国的人民和全世界的人民都和你们在一起。这个斗争一定会得到胜利。
    现在还留在朝鲜的亲爱的中国人民志愿军指挥员、战斗员同志们！
    当祖国人民欢度春节的时候，同样也首先想起了你们。你们为了支援我们亲密的邻邦反抗侵略，保卫自己祖国的安全，出国作战，终于打败了美国侵略者，取得了朝鲜停战的伟大胜利。现在你们还继续留在朝鲜同朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民一起，监视着敌人重新发动战争的阴谋，协助朝鲜人民进行战后的恢复建设工作，全国人民将继续全力支持你们，支持朝鲜人民恢复发展国民经济和争取祖国和平统一的斗争。
    亲爱的中国人民解放军全体指挥员战斗员同志们！亲爱的中国人民志愿军全体指挥员战斗员同志们！我国现在还处在被资本主义包围的情况之下，美帝国主义侵占了我国领土台湾，并且继续加剧国际紧张局势，企图挑动新的侵略战争，蒋介石卖国集团不断袭扰我国沿海，因此，全国人民希望你们提高警惕加紧训练，不断提高军事、政治和文化水平，熟练地掌握现代化军事科学和技术，并继续发扬艰苦奋斗、英勇牺牲、亲密团结、遵守纪律、克服困难、坚忍不拔的优良传统，为建设成为完全现代化的强大的革命军队而努力，为解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团、粉碎美蒋条约、保障祖国的安全、保障远东和世界和平而奋斗。
    祝你们春节快乐。
