Manufacturing Double-Wheel Two-Way Plows to Greet Spring Plowing
    To greet the coming spring plowing production season, the workers of the Kaifeng Machinery Factory are painting the newly manufactured 574 double-wheel two-way plows with a fresh coat of green paint, ready for shipment. This is the first batch of new products out of the 55,000 double-wheel two-way plows that the province plans to supply to farmers this year.

    Since the workers of the Kaifeng Machinery Factory began trial-manufacturing double-wheel two-way plows, they have been warmly welcomed by local farmers. Niu Lin, head of the agricultural production mutual aid group in Kaifeng County, brought fruit to comfort them on behalf of all the group members; the heads of 35 agricultural production cooperatives in Shangshui County jointly wrote a letter to the factory's workers, expressing their determination to produce more actively, sell more grain, cotton, and oil to support them. This greatly encouraged the factory workers, who collectively studied how to overcome difficulties during the trial manufacturing process, creating and improving more than 90 kinds of tools. To make it convenient for the farmer brothers to use in the future, they took the trial-manufactured double-wheel two-way plows to nearby farms and rural areas for field trials several times to listen to the farmers' opinions. The workers are excited and encouraged that this first batch of new products meets the specifications, and are actively preparing to invest in the next batch of production.

    制造双轮双铧犁迎接春耕
    为了迎接春耕生产季节的来临，开封机械厂的工人们正在把新制成的五百七十四部双轮双铧犁涂上一层新鲜的绿漆，准备起运了。这是全省今年计划供应农民五万五千部双轮双铧犁中的第一批新产品。
    开封机械厂工人自从试制双轮双铧犁以来，受到当地农民的热烈欢迎。开封县农业生产互助组长牛林代表全体组员带着水果来慰问他们；商水县三十五个农业生产合作社社长联名给该厂工人写信，表示要更加积极生产，多卖粮棉和油料来支援他们。这使该厂工人们受到很大鼓舞，他们在试制过程中集体研究克服困难，创造和改进了九十多种工具。为了农民兄弟们将来使用方便，他们曾几次把试制的双轮双铧犁拉到附近农场和农村作实地试验，听取农民的意见。工人们为这第一批新产品合乎规格而兴奋鼓舞，并积极准备投入下一批生产。
