Xinhua News Agency, Rome, January 24th: According to TASS, the Central Committee of the Italian Socialist Party held a plenary session in Rome on January 20th and 21st. The party's General Secretary Nenni delivered a report on the international situation and the domestic situation in Italy, and discussed the report.

Nenni's report pointed out that the issues causing divergence in international relations are: the issue of Germany's rearmament; the issue of the United States' frantic expansion of its atomic arsenal; the issue of the United States' blatant disregard for China's right to unify its own territory by aiding Chiang Kai-shek, thereby worsening the situation in the Far East; and the imminent danger inherent in maintaining the current state of division in Germany, Europe, and the world. Nenni said: We must do everything possible to demand the resumption of direct negotiations between East and West and launch a strong movement against thermonuclear weapons to oppose the deepening of this division.

Speaking of the domestic situation, Nenni emphasized that Italy is increasingly becoming a police state. The difficult and complex economic situation is characterized by: on the one hand, monopoly capitalists and speculators obtaining extremely large profits, and on the other hand, four to five million people unemployed or temporarily laid off, and twelve to fifteen million people whose living standards do not exceed or even fall below the minimum living standard.

Nenni then said that the overall situation is worrying because we must once again fight for the realization of our basic demands - freedom, peace and bread.

Nenni said that in this situation, the Italian Communist Party's Fourth National Congress once again emphasized the need for a policy of easing tensions and defending democracy, which is of great significance. This means reaffirming the basic principles of the two parties' common policy that has been established and developed over the past ten years, a policy of unswervingly striving to uphold constitutional democracy.

Nenni said: This is the road to socialism. If we manage to strengthen our basic organizations, win more people to participate in the democratic struggle, get cultural workers to care about our struggle, and end the isolation of important organizations and members of the anti-fascist and resistance movements, we will be stronger in parliament and it will be possible to raise the issue of implementing measures for a shift to the left.

After Nenni's speech, many members of the Central Committee spoke during the discussion of Nenni's report about various aspects of the domestic situation in Italy and the prospects for working among people of all strata, as well as about the struggle for democratic freedom, for political rights and for meeting the economic demands of the working people.

The plenary session decided to convene the party's Thirty-First National Congress on March 31st.

    意大利社会党中央委员会举行全体会议
    南尼就国际形势和意大利国内形势作了报告
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社罗马讯：意大利社会党中央委员会全体会议于一月二十日、二十一日在罗马举行。会议由党的总书记南尼作了关于国际形势和意大利国内局势的报告，并且讨论了这个报告。
    南尼的报告指出，在国际关系上引起分歧的问题是：德国重新武装问题；美国疯狂扩充原子军备问题；美国悍然不顾中国统一自己领土的权利而援助蒋介石、从而使远东局势恶化的问题；孕育在保持目前德国、欧洲和世界分裂状态中的迫在眉睫的危险问题。南尼说：必须尽一切力量要求恢复东西方直接谈判，开展反对热核武器的强有力的运动，来反对加深这种分裂状态。
    在谈到国内局势时，南尼着重指出，意大利正在日益成为一个警察国家。艰难而复杂的经济状况的特点是：一方面，垄断资本家和投机商获得极其庞大的利润，另一方面，却有四、五百万人失业或暂时解雇，有一千二百万或一千五百万人的生活水平不超过、甚至低于最低限度的生活水平。
    南尼接着说，总的局势是令人忧虑的，因为我们不得不再一次为争取实现我们的基本要求——自由、和平和面包——而进行斗争。
    南尼说，在这种情况下，意大利共产党第四次全国代表会议再次强调需要有一个缓和紧张局势和保卫民主的政策，这是有极大意义的。这意味着重新肯定十年来已经确立了并且发展了的两党共同政策的基本原则，这一政策也就是坚持不渝地为遵守宪法的民主而奋斗。
    南尼说：这就是通往社会主义的道路。如果我们设法加强我们的基本的组织，争取更多的人参加民主斗争，使文化工作者关心我们的斗争，并且结束反法西斯和抵抗运动的重要组织和成员所处的孤立状态，我们在议会中就必将更加强大，也就有可能提出贯彻向左转的措施的问题。
    南尼发言后，许多中央委员在讨论南尼报告时谈到意大利国内局势的各个方面和在各阶层人民中进行工作的前景，以及谈到为争取民主自由、争取政治权利和满足劳动人民的经济要求而进行的斗争。
    全体会议决定在三月三十一日召开党的第三十一届全国代表大会。
