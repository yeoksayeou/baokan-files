    Spokesman of the Vietnam People's Army Headquarters
    Denounces United Press's Shameless Rumors
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 19th: Vietnam News Agency, Hanoi, January 18th: The spokesman of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army issued the following statement on January 17th:
    "On January 14, 1955, United Press International released a message stating that the Royal Lao Government accused the Lao Resistance Forces of attacking and occupying two small strongholds of the Royal Lao Army in northern Laos on January 13, with the assistance of the Viet Minh.
    The General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army firmly denies these messages that are completely inconsistent with the facts, because all Vietnamese People's Volunteer Forces have correctly fulfilled the Geneva Accords and completely withdrew from Laos on November 16, 1954, which was more than two months ago. Therefore, the so-called recent activities of the Vietnamese People's Volunteer Forces assisting the Lao combat forces in Lao territory disseminated by United Press International are completely unfounded."

    越人民军总部发言人
    斥合众社的无耻造谣
    【新华社十九日讯】越南通讯社河内十八日讯：越南人民军总司令部发言人一月十七日发表声明如下：
    “一九五五年一月十四日，合众社发表消息说，老挝王国政府斥责寮国抗战部队一月十三日在越盟援助下，进攻并占领老挝王国军队在老挝北部的两处小据点。
    越南人民军总司令部坚决否认这些与事实完全不符的消息，因为，所有越南人民志愿部队都正确履行了日内瓦协定，在一九五四年十一月十六日，也就是两个多月以前，全部撤出老挝。因此，合众社播发的所谓越南人民志愿部队最近援助寮国战斗部队在老挝领土上进行什么活动的消息，都是毫无根据的。”
