    Xinhua News Agency, January 14th: Ankara dispatch: A communique issued simultaneously by the Turkish and Iraqi governments on the 12th stated that the talks, which began on January 6th between the Turkish government delegation led by Turkish Prime Minister Menderes and Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri Said, have concluded and a decision has been made to conclude a military treaty. The communique said, "This treaty will be finalized in the near future so that it can be signed immediately."
    Menderes' action of going to Baghdad to negotiate the signing of a military treaty with the Iraqi government is a step in the overall U.S. plan to establish a Middle East military bloc by signing a series of military treaties with Middle Eastern countries through Turkey and linking these countries to the Turkish-Pakistani agreement. Commenting on Menderes' visit to Iraq, the Lebanese newspaper "Al-Shark" emphasized the U.S. intention to extend the Turkish-Pakistani agreement to other Middle Eastern countries, primarily to Iraq and Iran. The Lebanese newspaper "Al-Khabar" also commented that the U.S. and British imperialists "are exerting heavy pressure on Arab countries in an attempt to drag them into the imperialists' war plans and turn the Near East into a springboard for the aggressive war they are preparing."
    After concluding the talks with the Iraqi government, Menderes is scheduled to leave Baghdad on January 14th for Damascus and Beirut. According to newspaper reports, Menderes will negotiate similar agreements with the Syrian and Lebanese governments respectively, in order to realize the U.S. conspiracy to establish a Middle East military bloc centered around the Turkish-Pakistani agreement.

    美国策划建立中近东军事侵略集团的一个步骤
    土耳其和伊拉克政府决定缔结军事条约
   【新华社十四日讯】安卡拉消息：土耳其政府和伊拉克政府在十二日同时发表的一项公报说，由土耳其总理曼德列斯率领的土耳其政府代表团和伊拉克首相努里·赛义德在一月六日开始举行的谈判已经结束，决定缔结一项军事条约。公报说，“在最近的将来，这项条约将最后拟妥，以便立即签订。”
    曼德列斯到巴格达去同伊拉克政府谈判签订军事条约这一行动，是美国企图通过土耳其同中近东国家签订一系列军事条约，把这些国家同土耳其—巴基斯坦协定联系起来，建立一个中近东军事集团的整个计划中的一个步骤。黎巴嫩“东方报”在评论曼德列斯访问伊拉克一事时强调指出美国要把土巴协定扩展到中近东其他国家，首先是扩展到伊拉克和伊朗去的意图。黎巴嫩“消息报”在评论此事时也指出，美英帝国主义者“正在向阿拉伯国家施以沉重的压力，企图把他们拖去参加帝国主义者的战争计划，并且把近东变成发动他们正在准备的侵略战争的跳板”。
    曼德列斯在同伊拉克政府的谈判结束以后，已定于一月十四日离开巴格达前往大马士革和贝鲁特。据报纸消息说，曼德列斯将分别同叙利亚政府和黎巴嫩政府谈判签订类似的协定，以便实现美国围绕着土耳其—巴基斯坦协定建立中近东军事集团的阴谋。
