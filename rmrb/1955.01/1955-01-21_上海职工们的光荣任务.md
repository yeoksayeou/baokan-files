The Glorious Task of Shanghai Workers
By Our Correspondents Zhang Chao, Wu Yubing, Ma Chaoqing

Before liberation, the vast majority of mechanical and electrical industrial factories in Shanghai only assembled and repaired machines imported by imperialists. Even some of the more important parts relied on foreign imports. Now, these factories are able to manufacture machines and have produced a large number of new products that have never been seen before.

Before liberation, the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant could only manufacture simple and crude agricultural tools such as hoes and plows. Now, this plant has successively manufactured nine new types of precision grinding machines and boring machines, supplying the needs of more than 100 industrial construction units across the country. Moreover, the trial production speed has increased from one per year in 1953 to one per month since the second half of last year. The Shanghai Electric Motor Plant, which in the past could only manufacture 150-kilowatt motors, trial-produced China's first 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator before the National Day of 1954. The body of the machine has more than 60,000 parts, and a single rotor weighs five tons. It can equip a power station and provide lighting power for a medium-sized city with a population of 300,000. The Shanghai Turbine Plant, formerly the "Universal Machinery Company," could only manufacture relatively simple components such as water pumps and blowers. Now, it can manufacture 450-horsepower high-speed diesel engines, medium-sized centrifugal blowers and other important power equipment. The Shanghai Boiler Plant, which before liberation could only manufacture miscellaneous items such as steel windows and electric fans, can now manufacture 18-ton giant boilers. The Shanghai Wire Factory, before liberation, only had three small hearth furnaces and some simple hand-pulled and foot-pedaled machines, and could only manufacture some simple leather wires and bare copper wires. Now it can manufacture 10,000-volt high-voltage power cables, as well as cables that can allow 1,200 pairs of telephone users to talk simultaneously. The state-owned Shanghai Electric Meter Factory has, in less than a year, trial-produced 24 new products such as automatic recording instruments and automatic control instruments, which can create automatic conditions for high-temperature operations in the metallurgical industry and other industries, or be used by universities for experiments.

In the past two years, more than 100 factories in Shanghai have sent thousands of tons of mechanical and electrical equipment to Anshan Iron and Steel, most of which are new products manufactured according to Soviet design specifications or samples. The Huai River construction site and the Guanting Reservoir and other construction sites in Hebei have also received thousands of tons of mechanical equipment from here. Eighteen-ton giant boilers have been put into production in the Harbin Flax Mill. The first new type of shallow-water passenger ship "Minzhong" and cargo ship "Dazhong" have joined the increasingly busy Yangtze River transportation work. The newly made "Beijing No. 2" train ferry has connected the Beijing-Hankou and Guangdong-Hankou railways. In the countryside, more and more farmers are using new agricultural machinery, using diesel engines for drought resistance and drainage, and increasing agricultural production. The workers and technicians in Shanghai support the socialist construction throughout the country with these carefully manufactured new products. They feel supremely honored to be able to complete these tasks.

Shanghai has become one of China's machine industry bases. In order to make full use of the technical strength of this base to better manufacture equipment for China's construction cause, the state will also invest in building new factories, renovating and expanding some factories in this area. The Shanghai Turbine Plant, Shanghai Electric Motor Plant, and Shanghai Boiler Plant are expanding new factory buildings and installing new or automated equipment. They will cooperate in production and continue to independently manufacture complete sets of steam turbine generator equipment. After the renovation projects of the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant and other factories are completed, they will produce more and more precise machine tools and a large number of tools.

New product trial production is an extremely complex and detailed production process. The trial production procedures for important new products, including design work, sample trial production, small-batch trial production, etc., have more than 20 major and minor procedures before they can be put into mass production. To this end, since 1953, various factories have strengthened the leadership and management of new product trial production. The state-owned Shanghai Machine Tool Plant took a series of measures in 1954 to promote work plans and strengthen technical preparations before production, thus accelerating the trial production speed and ensuring quality. Most of the new products are trial-produced according to Soviet or Czechoslovak specifications and under the guidance of experts, which has prompted the vast number of workers and technicians to launch a wave of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. Many factories have specially established expert offices to systematically study and implement the suggestions of experts under leadership. Many new products from the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant and others have been successfully trial-produced under the systematic guidance of Soviet experts.

In the process of new product trial production, workers, staff and technicians have gradually overcome various difficulties in equipment, materials, technology, etc. left over from colonial industrialization, and strived to improve their skills from the level of repair and assembly to the level of being able to manufacture modern products. Here, we can take the Shanghai Electric Meter Factory as an example. When trial-producing two new products, automatic recording instruments and automatic control instruments, they encountered many difficulties. First, there were no inspection instruments and equipment, especially the most necessary cathode ray indicator and electronic tube voltmeter. This made it impossible to measure the circuit faults in the trial-produced instruments, and almost made it impossible to continue the work. However, the workers used another electronic amplifier to replace the measurement. Secondly, there is a series of precisely matched small gears inside the body of the recording instrument, which require specially made knives to mill. However, after searching all over Shanghai, they could not be found. Finally, several old workers came up with a solution. They first shoveled several milling cutters, and then carefully modified them according to the shape of the small gears in the Soviet instrument, solving the problem of milling tools. Many special materials have also been replaced and resolved by workers and technicians through cooperative research.

However, until now, there are still great shortcomings in the new product trial production work in many factories, the main ones being: First, the product design ideas are not serious, and some people arbitrarily change advanced product drawings in order to "create" and "invent"; Second, there is a lack of necessary management systems and sound organizational structures, and the laxity and temporary crash work habits of the repair-oriented era are still very strong. Individual leading cadres are sometimes not very concerned about the suggestions and opinions of experts due to complacency and conservatism.

What is particularly worth mentioning is that, with the exception of a few factories such as the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, the party organizations in various factories lack a clear understanding of their responsibility to guarantee and supervise the trial production of new products. The party committees and workshop branches of some factories do not regularly conduct political and ideological work on the trial production of new products among party members and the masses, do not emphasize the significance and role of new product trial production in the country's socialist construction, do not criticize and fight against various errors and shortcomings in this regard, or assign this work to a few people, and these few people also have an unclear understanding of new products.

Due to these reasons, some factories, such as the Shanghai Tool Factory, Shanghai Turbine Plant, and Shanghai Boiler Plant, have failed to complete the trial production tasks according to plan, or the product quality is poor and the scrap rate is high. (Attached photo)

    上海职工们的光荣任务
    本报记者　张潮　吴于冰　马超卿
    在解放以前，上海绝大多数机械电器工业工厂，只是装配和修理帝国主义输入的机器，连一些比较重要的零件也靠外国输入。现在，这些工厂已经能够制造机器，并已生产了大批从未见过的新式产品。
    上海机床厂解放前只能制造锄头、犁耙等简单粗糙的农具，现在，这个厂已先后制造出九种新型的精密的磨床、镗床，供应着全国一百多家工业建设单位的需要。而且，试制速度已由一九五三年的每年一种提高到从去年下半年起的每月一种。过去只能制造一百五十瓩电动机的上海电机厂，已在一九五四年国庆节前试制成我国第一部六千瓩汽轮发电机，机身内大小部件共有六万多个，一个转子就有五吨重，它装起一个发电站，可供三十万人口的中等城市的照明用电。上海汽轮机厂，就是解放前的“通用机器公司”，从前只能制造比较简单的水泵、鼓风机等机件。现在已能制造四百五十匹马力的高速柴油机，中型离心式鼓风机等重要电力设备。解放前只能制造钢窗、电扇等杂件的上海锅炉厂，现在能够制造十八吨巨型锅炉。上海电线厂，解放前只有三只小地炉和一些手拉脚踏的简陋机器，只能制造一些简单的皮线和裸铜线。现在能够制造一万伏高压电力电缆，以及能使一千二百对电话用户同时通话的电缆。国营上海电表厂，不到一年功夫，就已试制成二十四种自动化记录仪表和自动化控制仪表等新产品，可以给冶金工业和其他工业的高温操作创造自动化条件，或者供大学作实验之用。
    两年来，上海有一百多家工厂给鞍钢送去了成千吨机械和电气设备，其中大部分是按照苏联的设计规范或样品制造的新产品。淮河建设工地和河北官厅水库等工地，也从这里得到了成千吨机械设备。十八吨巨型锅炉已经在哈尔滨亚麻厂里投入生产。第一艘新型浅水客轮民众号和货轮大众号，已经参加了日益繁忙的长江运输工作。刚刚制成的
  “北京二号”火车渡轮，已经把京汉、粤汉两条铁路连接起来了。在农村里，越来越多的农民们在使用着新式的农业机械，使用柴油机抗旱排涝，增加农业生产。上海的工人和技术人员们就以这些精心制造的新产品，支援着全国各地的社会主义建设。他们并以能够完成这些任务而感到无上的光荣。
    上海已成为我国机器工业基地之一。为了充分利用这个基地的技术力量，以便更好地为我国建设事业制造设备，国家并将在这个地区里投资新建、改建和扩建一些工厂。上海汽轮机厂、上海电机厂和上海锅炉厂正在扩建新的厂房，安装新式的或自动化的设备，它们将协作生产，继续独立制造成套的汽轮发电机设备。上海机床厂等改建工程完成后，将生产更多更精密的工作母机和大批工具。
    新产品试制是一项极其复杂细致的生产过程，重要新产品的试制程序，包括设计工作、样品试制、小批试制等共有大小程序二十多道，然后才能投入大批生产。为此，从一九五三年起，各厂加强了新产品试制的领导和管理工作。国营上海机床厂在一九五四年内采取了一系列的措施，推行作业计划和加强生产前的技术准备工作，因而加速了试制速度，保证了质量。大部分的新产品都是按照苏联或捷克斯洛伐克的规格并在专家的指导下试制的，这就促使广大工人和技术人员掀起了学习苏联和捷克斯洛伐克先进经验的热潮。许多工厂专门设立了专家办公室，以便有领导地学习和贯彻专家的建议。上海机床厂等许多新产品，就是在苏联专家这样系统指导下试制成功的。
    在新产品的试制过程中，职工群众和技术人员们，逐步克服了殖民地性工业遗留下来的设备、资料、技术等各种困难，把自己的技术从修修配配的水平努力提高到能够制造近代产品的水平。这里，可以举上海电表厂做例子。在试制自动化的记录仪表和控制仪表两种新产品时，碰到不少困难，首先是没有检验的仪器和设备，特别是最必需的阴极丝指示器和电子管电压表。这样就无法测定试制仪表中的线路故障，几乎因此而不能继续进行工作。可是职工们却利用另一只电子放大器来代替测量。其次，记录仪表的机身内有一连串精密配合小齿轮，需要特制刀来铣制，但是踏遍上海无觅处，最后，几个老工人想出了办法，先铲了几把铣刀，然后照着苏联仪表内小齿轮的形状，精细地加以修正，解决了铣制的工具。有许多特殊材料，经过工人和技术人员合作研究，也逐一利用其他材料来代替、解决了。
    但是，直到现在，在不少的工厂里，新产品试制工作仍有很大的缺点，其中主要的是：一、产品设计思想不严肃，有的人为了“创造”和“发明”，随便改变先进的产品图纸；二、缺乏必要的管理制度和健全的组织机构，修配性时代的散漫、临时突击的习气还很浓厚。个别领导干部由于自满保守，对于专家的建议和意见，有时还不十分重视。
    特别值得提出的是：除了上海机床厂等少数厂以外，各厂党组织对新产品试制的保证监督责任缺乏明确的认识。有些厂的党委会和车间支部没有经常向党员和群众进行新产品试制的政治思想工作，不强调新产品试制对国家社会主义建设的意义和作用，不向这方面的各种错误缺点进行批评斗争，或者把这项工作交给少数几个人去作，而这几个人对新产品的认识也是不清楚的。
    由于这些原因，如上海工具厂、上海汽轮机厂和上海锅炉厂等一些工厂就不能按计划完成试制任务，或者产品质量不好，报废率很大。（附图片）
