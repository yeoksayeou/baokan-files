Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 1st: According to a report from the German News Agency, the German Communist Party Congress held in Hamburg victoriously concluded on December 30th, 1954.

    At the meeting on the 30th, the congress passed the thirty-two point program proposed by the Central Committee of the German Communist Party. The program summarized the current political situation and determined the line of the German Communist Party in the struggle against the revival of aggressive German militarism, for the unification of Germany on the basis of peace and democracy, and for the establishment of a pan-European collective security system.

    The congress also passed the amendment to the German Communist Party Constitution. The revised constitution stipulates the abolition of the post of Party Chairman, and the election of a First Secretary and several secretaries of the Secretariat from the Party Central Committee.

    Based on the proposal of several delegations, the congress decided to continue recruiting party members in memory of Thälmann, until Thälmann's 69th birthday in 1955.

    Subsequently, the congress elected the Central Committee of the German Communist Party. Max Reimann was elected as the First Secretary of the Central Committee. When this result was announced, the delegates applauded for a long time.

    After electing the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, the congress passed an Appeal to the German People.

    Following this, Willi Mohn delivered a closing speech. When discussing the specific tasks of the party decided by the congress, Mohn pointed out that it is necessary to mobilize all the party's forces to prevent the ratification of the Paris Accords and to strengthen explanatory work among the people in order to point out the dangers contained in the Paris Accords and to explain the great significance of the Moscow Conference Declaration of European countries. Therefore, it was decided to hold a Struggle Week against the Paris Accords from January 10th to 20th. At that time, mass rallies and demonstrations should be organized in major cities in West Germany, and Communist Party members should attract people from all walks of life to participate in these activities.

    Mohn said that establishing united action between Communist Party members and Social Democratic Party members in West Germany, and among all German workers, is also an important task of the party. For this purpose, mutual visits by delegations from West Germany and the German Democratic Republic must be facilitated. He went on to emphasize that the working class, peasants, youth, and all other peace-loving and democratic forces representing all sectors of the people must unite into a united front.

    Mohn finally emphasized that the German Communist Party Congress pointed out the path to solving extremely important national problems, and showed that the German Communist Party is carrying out a consistent struggle for the national interests of the German people, for peace and freedom, for friendly relations between the German people and the people of other countries, and for proletarian internationalism.

    Finally, the congress broadcast a recording of Reimann's speech, who was unable to attend the congress due to the threat of arrest.

    After the congress adjourned, thousands of working people in Hamburg held a mass rally together with the delegates of the congress, at which they unanimously expressed their determination to carry out unremitting struggle for the peaceful unification of Germany.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, January 1st: According to a TASS report from Berlin, the German News Agency reported that the German Communist Party Congress held in Hamburg passed an Appeal to the German People on December 30th, 1954.

    The Appeal to the German People stated: The German Communist Party Congress calls on all Germans: the decisive moment has arrived. Today, every German faces two paths, either to allow the Paris Accords to be ratified, or to reject the Paris Accords; there is no third way. At the same time as the ratification of the Paris Accords, militarists are conducting trials in Karlsruhe, intending to ban the German Communist Party. If the German Communist Party is banned and the military agreement is ratified, all democratic freedoms will also inevitably be eliminated. The German people should unite against this war preparation.

    The Appeal calls on Social Democrats, trade union members, and Communist Party members to take joint action to defeat the attempt to re-militarize. The delegates of the German Communist Party Congress declare to every German, especially the members of the Bonn Federal Parliament, that ratifying the Paris Accords means the permanent division of Germany. The German people must open the path to unity, freedom, and peace for themselves.

    德国共产党代表大会胜利闭幕
    通过三十二点纲领、告人民书并选出德共中央
    决定一月十日至二十日举行反对巴黎协定斗争周
    【新华社柏林一日电】据德意志通讯社消息：在汉堡举行的德国共产党代表大会已经在一九五四年十二月三十日胜利闭幕。
    在三十日的会议上，大会通过了德国共产党中央委员会提出的三十二点纲领。纲领综述了目前的政治形势，决定了德国共产党在反对复活侵略性的德国军国主义、争取在和平和民主的基础上统一德国、争取建立全欧集体安全体系的斗争中的路线。
    大会还通过了德国共产党党章修改案，修改以后的党章规定取消党的主席的职务，并且从党中央委员会中选出第一书记一人和书记处书记数人。
    大会根据一些代表团的提议，决定为了纪念台尔曼而继续征收党员，一直到一九五五年台尔曼的六十九周年诞辰为止。
    接着，大会选举了德国共产党中央委员会。马克斯·雷曼当选为中央委员会第一书记。这个结果宣布时，大会代表经久不息地鼓掌。
    大会在选出了德国共产党中央委员会以后通过了告德国人民书。
    随后，维利·莫恩致闭幕词。莫恩在谈到代表大会所决定的党的具体任务时指出：必须动员党的所有力量阻止批准巴黎协定，并且要在人民中间加强解释的工作，以便向人民指出巴黎协定所包藏的危险性，解释欧洲国家莫斯科会议宣言的伟大意义。因此特定一月十日至二十日举行反对巴黎协定斗争周。在那个时候，西德各大城市应当组织群众大会和示威游行，共产党员应当吸引各阶层人民参加这些活动。
    莫恩说：在共产党员和西德社会民主党党员的工人之间、在全德国劳动者之间建立统一行动也是党的重要任务。为了这个目的必须使西德和德意志民主共和国的代表团互相往来。他接着强调说，工人阶级、农民、青年和其他所有代表各阶层人民的和平民主力量必须结合成一个统一战线。
    莫恩最后着重指出，德国共产党代表大会指出了解决十分重要的国家问题的道路，指出德国共产党为争取德国人民的民族利益、争取和平自由、争取德国人民和其他国家的人民之间的友好关系、争取无产阶级国际主义而进行一贯的斗争。
    最后，大会放送了因受到逮捕的威胁而未能出席大会的雷曼讲话的录音。
    大会闭幕后，汉堡成千的劳动人民同代表大会的代表们一起举行了群众大会，他们在会上一致表示决心为德国的和平统一而进行不懈的斗争。
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：德意志通讯社报道：在汉堡举行的德国共产党代表大会在一九五四年十二月三十日通过了告德国人民书。
    告德国人民书说：德国共产党代表大会号召全体德国人：决定性的时刻到来了。今天每一个德国人面前摆着两条路，或者让巴黎协定得到批准，或者是拒绝巴黎协定，第三条路是没有的。在批准巴黎协定同时，军国主义分子在加尔斯卢合进行审讯，打算禁止德国共产党。如果德国共产党被禁止，军事协定被批准，一切民主自由也必将同样被消灭。德国人民应当团结一致反对这种战争准备。
    告人民书呼吁社会民主党人、工会会员和共产党员采取联合行动，使重新军国主义化的企图陷于失败。德共代表大会的代表向每一个德国人特别是波恩联邦议院的议员宣告，批准巴黎协定意味着永远分裂德国。德国人民要替自己打开通向团结、自由、和平的路。
