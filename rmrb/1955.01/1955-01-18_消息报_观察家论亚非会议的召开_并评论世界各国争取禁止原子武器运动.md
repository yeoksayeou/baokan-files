Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 16th: TASS Moscow, January 15th—"Izvestia's" international affairs observer, Mikhailov, wrote: Asian and African newspapers are currently paying close attention to the Asian-African Conference to be held in Bandung, Indonesia at the end of April, and emphasize its importance. The purpose of this conference, to be held on the broadest possible basis, is to promote world peace and the economic and social development of Africa and Asia. The conference will also study some special issues, including colonialism, racism and national sovereignty.

Asian and African newspapers have taken note of the comments on this conference by the United States and those colonial countries that act as the United States' partners in military blocs, especially the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. For example, Egyptian newspapers wrote that Washington and London are very dissatisfied and even frightened by this conference. Indonesian newspapers also mentioned that Washington expressed a hostile reaction and panic at the prospect of Asian and African countries holding a conference.

Asian and African newspapers pointed out that what particularly alarmed Western countries was that the colonial policies they adopted that were hostile to the independence of Asian and African countries would be condemned at the Bandung Conference. Newspapers also pointed out that Western countries would find themselves in the position of being judged at this conference. The press in Asia and Africa believes that the same may be true of the provocative policies adopted by the United States towards China's Taiwan Island.

These journalists said that another possible scenario is that the majority of countries participating in the conference will pass judgment on the imperialist policy of turning a large area from Turkey to Japan into a military bridgehead, and attempting to lure Asian and African countries into joining imperialist military blocs.

According to Asian newspaper commentators, all of this will make the advocates of the "position of strength" policy consider the upcoming Asian-African Conference as "inappropriate." There have been many reports in the newspapers that Western countries will not limit themselves to expressing dissatisfaction with the conference, but will take action to prevent the conference from succeeding. Mikhailov wrote that observers have also noted that although these conspiracies are being planned by Washington, the American ruling circles will avoid directly attacking the conference for obvious reasons. Washington is willing to operate behind the scenes and let others stand in front. However, the public in Asia and Africa are now vigilantly watching the tricks of those who hate peace and international cooperation.

Xinhua News Agency, January 17th: TASS Moscow, January 15th—"Izvestia" published Mikhailov's commentary, pointing out that the movement of various countries in the world to strive for the prohibition of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction is developing vigorously.

Mikhailov wrote that the aggressive North Atlantic Group Council's meeting last December formally instructed the Group's headquarters, headed by US General Gruenther, to prepare for atomic warfare. This is in line with the broad plans of the US aggressive group to prepare for a new war using weapons of mass destruction. Unable to avoid taking into account the serious unease caused by these measures among the public in various countries, especially in Western European countries with smaller territories, dense populations, and concentrated industries, American atomic mongers are attempting to paralyze the vigilance of the people of various countries with all sorts of deceptive tricks. Western politicians have made many remarks in recent weeks in an attempt to convince public opinion of the completely fabricated notion that atomic war is inevitable and even necessary.

Mikhailov pointed out that all the conspiracies of the atomic war propagandists cannot shake the determination of the people of various countries to demand the prohibition of such destructive weapons. Worldwide, the public is increasingly strongly demanding that the criminal conspiracies of the American atomic mongers be stopped and that weapons of mass destruction be declared illegal. In Britain, France, and other Western European countries, millions of people have made this demand through numerous congresses and rallies, through petitions and appeals.

    “消息报”观察家论亚非会议的召开
    并评论世界各国争取禁止原子武器运动
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十五日讯：“消息报”的国际问题观察家米哈伊洛夫写道：亚洲和非洲国家的报纸目前很注意将于四月底在印度尼西亚万隆举行的亚非会议，并且着重地指出它的重要性。这个将在最广泛的基础上召开的会议的目的，是为了促进世界和平以及非洲和亚洲的经济和社会发展。会议还将研究一些特殊的问题，其中包括殖民主义、种族主义和民族主权问题。
    亚洲和非洲的报纸注意到了美国以及那些在军事集团特别是东南亚条约组织中充当美国的伙伴的殖民国家方面对这个会议的评论。例如，埃及报纸写道，华盛顿和伦敦对这个会议表示非常不满意，甚至感到害怕。印度尼西亚报纸同样提到，由于亚洲和非洲国家将要举行一次会议，华盛顿表示了敌意的反应和惊慌的情绪。
    亚洲和非洲的报纸指出，特别使西方国家感到惊慌的是，西方国家所采取的同亚洲和非洲国家的独立相敌对的殖民政策将在万隆会议上受到谴责。报纸还指出，西方国家将发现它们在这个会议上是居于被审判的地位。亚洲和非洲国家的新闻界认为，关于美国对中国的台湾岛所采取的挑衅政策，可能也是同样的情况。
    这些新闻界人士说，另外还可能发生的情况是：大多数参加会议的国家将会对那种把从土耳其到日本的大片地区变为一个军事桥头堡，以及企图诱骗亚非国家加入帝国主义军事集团的帝国主义政策作出判决。
    据亚洲报纸的评论员说，所有这一切将使得“实力地位”政策的鼓动者把即将召开的亚非会议认为是“不适宜的”。报纸上已有许多消息说，西方国家将不限于对会议表示不满，而将采取行动来阻止会议获得成功。米哈伊洛夫写道，观察家们也注意到，虽然这些阴谋活动是由华盛顿策划的，但是美国统治集团为了明显的理由将避免对会议进行直接的攻击。华盛顿愿意在幕后活动而让别人站在前面。但是，亚洲和非洲的公众现在正警惕地注视着那些憎恨和平和国际合作的人们的诡计。
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十五日讯：“消息报”刊载了米哈伊洛夫的评论，指出世界各国争取禁止原子武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器的运动正在有力地开展。
    米哈伊洛夫写道，侵略性的北大西洋集团理事会去年十二月举行的会议正式指令以美国将领格仑瑟为首的这个集团的司令部准备原子战争。这是符合美国侵略集团准备使用大规模毁灭性武器的新战争的广泛计划的。由于不能不考虑到这些措施在世界各国公众方面，特别是在那些领土面积较小、人口稠密而工业集中的西欧国家公众方面引起的严重不安，美国原子贩子于是企图用各种各样骗人的花样来麻痹各国人民的警惕。西方政客们最近几个星期中发表了许多言论，企图使公众舆论相信原子战争是不可避免甚至是必要的这种完全虚构的说法。
    米哈伊洛夫指出，但是原子战争宣传家们的一切阴谋都不能够动摇各国人民要求禁止这种毁灭性武器的决心。全世界公众日益强烈地要求制止美国原子贩子的罪恶阴谋，宣布大规模毁灭性武器为非法。在英国、法国和其他西欧国家，成百万的人民已经通过许多大会和集会，通过请愿书和呼吁书提出了这种要求。
