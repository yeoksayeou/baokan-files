New Problems Under the New Situation

    In the vast rural areas of Heilongjiang Province, based on long-term preparations for establishing cooperatives, a mass cooperative movement has surged since the summer of last year. The broad masses of farmers have joined agricultural production cooperatives in batches; a considerable number of middle peasants have actively requested to join; taking the road of collectivization has become the center of public opinion among the peasant masses. Existing cooperatives are actively absorbing new members; mutual aid teams that have already "registered" and are preparing to establish cooperatives are actively considering absorbing more members; many mutual aid teams that have not "registered" are actively requesting registration, and mutual aid teams that do not meet the conditions are also requesting further development and improvement. However, in the initial period, the leadership failed to adapt to this new situation and strengthen leadership in a timely manner, and in many places, the masses spontaneously deliberated and acted. Under these circumstances, many problems arose:

    I. The strong seek the strong, and the tough seek the tough, excluding poor farmers. Some cooperatives put forward "four don'ts": don't want those with weak labor, don't want those without horses, don't want those with bad land, and don't want those who can't afford to invest. Well-to-do households consider poor farmers a "burden," believing that their joining the cooperative would "affect the cooperative's ability to exert its advantages"; they say that poor peasants can't afford to invest and call on well-to-do households to "bear the burden." When Xiqin Village in Shuangcheng County began deliberating on establishing a cooperative, twenty-six of the thirty-six poor households in the village actively requested to join; however, eleven of them were left out. Some poor households, unable to join the cooperative, pessimistically said: "They (referring to the well-to-do households) are all going to heaven, leaving us on the ground!" Zhang Shurong, of the Lidi Fangzi Village mutual aid team in Longjiang County, a poor household in his group requested to join the cooperative, but the cooperative was unwilling to accept him; however, they were eager to accept Zhang Shurong, who peddled hay, hired short-term workers on a large scale, and had capitalist ideas, saying that he "can manage things, is strong, and will be a pillar of the cooperative."

    Many farmers who requested to join the cooperative had various ideas: some wanted to join the old cooperative, saying that the old cooperative had "a thick foundation"; some old cooperatives closed their doors and refused to absorb new members, saying "the horses sit on the throne after the cattle built the kingdom," fearing that the newly joined members would take advantage of them; some farmers had already registered to join the original group, but were afraid that the leaders of the original group were not very good, and requested to join another group.

    Some well-to-do households only find other well-to-do households to organize cooperatives, and some poor households have to form separate cooperatives; some backbone members are afraid that ordinary farmers are not easy to lead, and only find Party members, Youth League members, and village cadres to organize cooperatives; thus, "rich cooperatives," "poor cooperatives," and "backbone cooperatives" have appeared.

    II. Under these circumstances, there has been a phenomenon of competing for backbone members, competing for members, disharmony among each other, and blind concentration of backbone members. Zhao Jiuchang, the Party branch secretary of Qingning Village in Shuangcheng County, wanted to establish a cooperative with his mutual aid team, but the number of households was small, so he went to Wang Fengxiang, the propaganda committee member's mutual aid team to absorb members into the cooperative; Wang Fengxiang found out and quarreled with Zhao Jiuchang, saying, "You know it's glorious to establish a cooperative, don't I know it's glorious? You reached out your devil's claw and grabbed my group members away!" Some groups that did not meet the conditions for establishing a cooperative, other groups that did meet the conditions went to these groups to compete for backbone members and "tough" members. Some backbone members of mutual aid teams, seeing that their group could not establish a cooperative, abandoned their group and ran to the cooperative; they thought that leading a mutual aid team was troublesome, and after joining the cooperative, they would be "worry-free," "quiet," and "no longer have to be a team leader!" The backbone members of seven or eight groups concentrated together to establish a cooperative; some groups met all other conditions, but were worried that there were too few backbone members and could not run a cooperative.

    III. As a result of the masses finding their own targets, some farmers who were temporarily unwilling to join the cooperative were left behind, without leadership; some encountered many difficulties, lacked farm tools, lacked horses, and affected production. In Huaguang Village in Baiquan County, six mutual aid teams, forty-eight households, got together to establish a cooperative, leaving twenty-one households without a home; Liyecun Village Li Jiatun was left with thirty-one households, with only one cart, unable to carry out production.

    IV. Under these circumstances, wealthy peasants and wealthy peasants with serious capitalist spontaneous tendencies took the opportunity to organize fake mutual aid teams and fake cooperatives. Jiang Jichen and Liu Jingshan, wealthy peasants in Xiqin Village, Shuangcheng County, used petty favors to win over more difficult farmers and relatives, not allowing them to join the cooperative, in an attempt to organize fake mutual aid teams. In Hulan and other counties, some wealthy peasants and peasants with serious capitalist ideas formed fake cooperatives; they said: If you join their cooperative (referring to cooperatives with Party members and activists), you won't fall into the hands of a stepmother! Let's form our own cooperative and make our own decisions. They not only exclude poor households, but also do not want Party members and Youth League members, fearing that they will "only tell the truth."

What to do?

    Faced with these problems, the leadership in some counties and districts failed to improve their leadership methods and style in a timely manner, affecting the normal development of the movement. The leadership in some counties and districts strengthened their leadership in response to this new situation, enabling the movement to develop more healthily. Xiqin Village in Shuangcheng County, Jiefang Village in Huachuan County, and Lidi Fangzi Village in Longjiang County also created the experience of "under the leadership of the Party branch, taking the village as a unit, and combining the intentions of the leadership with the demands of the masses to conduct overall planning." The Provincial Party Committee summarized this experience and is promoting it throughout the province. This is one of the important factors ensuring that the agricultural cooperative movement in the province can develop in a basically healthy manner.

    How to conduct overall planning? Mainly: according to the cooperative plan initially formulated by the leadership, the demands of the masses, and the various conditions of the old cooperatives and the mutual aid teams preparing to establish cooperatives, after conducting thorough ideological education, the leadership leads the masses to conduct detailed discussions to determine the plan for carrying out the cooperative movement throughout the village. The plan includes: how many new cooperatives to develop, how many households in each new cooperative, how many households to expand the old cooperatives, and how many mutual aid teams to organize; which masses and which backbone members to participate in which new cooperative, which masses and which backbone members to join which old cooperative, which masses and which backbone members to organize how many mutual aid teams, who and who are in the same group, who and who are in the same cooperative; which groups can establish cooperatives next year or the year after, and which groups can be used as the target for expansion next year or the year after. In the process of determining the plan, focus on conducting class policy education, and according to various conditions, under the principle of voluntary participation by the masses, appropriately arrange for poor households to join new cooperatives or old cooperatives. After such overall planning is carried out and the organizational form is determined, the original cooperatives and the construction preparation committees of the new cooperatives will separately formulate plans to increase production and ensure income and this year's production preparation work, on the one hand leading the masses to realize the production plan, and on the other hand leading the masses to deliberate on establishing and expanding cooperatives. On the basis of doing this work, build a batch when they are mature, building and consolidating at the same time.

    This is what Xiqin Village in Shuangcheng County did. The Party branch of this village, according to the village's cooperative plan (the original two old cooperatives expanded by 40% to 50%, established six new cooperatives, to achieve basic collectivization), specifically helped the old cooperatives and the groups preparing to establish cooperatives formulate expansion plans for the old cooperatives and establishment plans for the new cooperatives. The two old cooperatives, according to their needs and possible conditions, will use new-style animal-powered farm tools on 50% of the cultivated land area of the entire cooperative this year, and at the same time develop a batch of livestock; according to the needs of expanding production and the leadership conditions of each cooperative, the "Shengfeng" cooperative plans to develop fifteen more households on the basis of the original thirty-five households, and the "Yongfeng" cooperative plans to develop ten more households on the basis of the twenty-two households. Six groups preparing to establish cooperatives, in order to adapt to the needs of using new-style animal-powered farm tools, and at the same time take into account the leadership conditions, plan to expand from the original eleven or twelve horses to eighteen to twenty horses; therefore, the number of households should also be expanded to about twenty-five households accordingly. At the same time, help farmers who are temporarily unwilling to join the cooperative reorganize two mutual aid teams as targets for the "Yongfeng" cooperative and another cooperative to expand next year; under the leadership of the branch, the two cooperatives are responsible for long-term cultivation. The eleven poor households who requested to join the cooperative but were excluded also joined the new cooperatives or old cooperatives after the branch educated the members, and everyone was very satisfied. Village cadres generally believe that this is really good, otherwise it would be chaotic, not only will this year not be done well, but it will also affect next year.

    Practice has proved that the larger the scale of development of the cooperative movement, the more necessary it is to carry out work with leadership, planning, and steps; not only should the province, county, and district have plans, but each village should also have a more comprehensive and long-term plan; the plan should not only include the development of new cooperatives, consolidation and improvement of old cooperatives, and rectification and improvement of mutual aid teams, but also include technological reforms, expansion of production, and development of supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperative undertakings. Only in this way can we comprehensively promote the socialist transformation of agriculture. After the overall plan is determined, specific arrangements must be made; after the specific arrangements are made, the new cooperatives are set up, and the preparatory committee is elected, they can on the one hand lead production, and on the other hand deliberate on establishing cooperatives.

What should be paid attention to?

    According to the situation of Heilongjiang Province promoting this experience, in order for district and village cadres to correctly grasp and apply this working method, attention should be paid to the following:

    I. District and village cadres must be made to clearly understand the situation and characteristics of the great development of the cooperative movement, as well as the principles and policies that must be grasped in the movement, so that they realize that in the case of the great development of agricultural cooperatives, it is no longer enough to consider problems only within the scope of the new cooperatives themselves. It is necessary to guide them to look at the whole district and the whole village, and consider problems from the perspective of comprehensively promoting the agricultural cooperative movement: it is necessary to consider expanding old cooperatives, and also to consider establishing new cooperatives; it is necessary to consider the development of cooperatives, and also to consider the rectification and improvement of mutual aid teams; it is necessary to consider this year, and also to consider the future; it is necessary to consider agricultural cooperation, and also to consider the coordination of other economic work. They must be made to realize that only in this way can the Party's policies be fully implemented and the cooperative movement can be led to develop along the correct path.

    II. District and village cadres must be made to understand that to do a good job of overall planning, it is necessary to do arduous educational work and meticulous organizational work. On the one hand, it is necessary to recognize that the chaotic phenomena occurring in the context of great development can be avoided, and on the other hand, it is also necessary to recognize that it is not very easy to avoid these phenomena. When implementing overall planning, it is necessary to adhere to the mass line working method of combining leadership and the masses, and prevent the occurrence of forced grouping and forced cooperative formation, which violate the principle of voluntariness. When carrying out overall planning, special attention must be paid to conducting in-depth, extensive, and comprehensive education on cooperation policies and class policies, to improve the socialist awareness of the broad masses inside and outside the cooperative, improve the enthusiasm for mutual assistance and cooperation and the spirit of unity and friendship in taking the road to common prosperity, and improve vigilance against wealthy peasants and other saboteurs.

    III. In the planning process, to determine the scale and speed of cooperation in the cooperative, it is necessary to accurately understand the original foundation of mutual aid and cooperation organizations in the village and the true ideological situation of the masses at all levels, and handle affairs according to specific conditions, and never rely solely on the enthusiasm of leading cadres, regardless of the laws of the movement itself.

    IV. Throughout the entire work process, it is necessary to closely rely on the Party branch, and at the same time give full play to the strength of mass organizations such as the Youth League branch, women's federation, and militia, and fully utilize the mutual aid and cooperation network.

    At present, it seems that there are still many problems in various parts of Heilongjiang Province in promoting this experience. Some still do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of adopting this method, and some have produced phenomena of coercion and command in implementing overall planning, which should be quickly overcome and corrected. Combining production work and supply and marketing credit cooperation work in the overall planning is only beginning, and it is not done well enough, and it needs to be further strengthened.

    在全村范围内实行合作化运动的全面规划
    ——黑龙江省领导农业生产合作社大发展的经验
    陈文志
    新形势下的新问题
    黑龙江省广大农村，在常年准备建社的基础上，从去年夏季开始，群众性的合作化运动高涨起来。广大农民成批地加入农业生产合作社；相当大一部分中农积极地要求入社；走合作化道路已成为农民群众的舆论中心。原有的社积极吸收新社员，已“报名挂号”准备建社的互助组积极酝酿吸收更多的社员，许多没有“报名挂号”的互助组积极要求报名挂号，不够条件的互助组也要求进一步发展和提高。可是，最初一个时期，领导方面没有适应这个新的情况及时加强领导，很多地方是群众自发地酝酿、活动。在这种情况下，就产生了很多问题：
    一、强找强，硬找硬，排挤贫困农民。有的社提出“四不要”：劳力弱的不要，没马的不要，地不好的不要，投不起资的不要。富裕户认为贫困农民是“累赘”，认为他们入了社“影响合作社发挥优越性”；说贫农缴不起投资叫富裕户“背苦”。双城县希勤村开始酝酿建社时，全村三十六户贫困户，有二十六户积极要求入社；但其中有十一户都被甩在外边。有的贫困户入不了社，悲观地说：
  “人家（指富裕户）都上天堂，就把咱们甩在地下啦！”龙江县李地房子村张树荣互助组中的一户贫困户要求入社，社里不愿要；但是，对于捣卖谷草、大量雇短工、有资本主义思想的张树荣却争着要，说他“能张罗，力气足，入社是个大梁”。
    许多要求入社的农民有各种不同的想法：有的要求入老社，说老社“家底厚”；有的老社却关起大门来不吸收，说“牛打江山马坐殿”，怕新入社的社员沾他们的光；有的农民已在原组报名入社，但又怕原组领导人不很好，而要求参加别的组。
    有些富裕户只找富裕户组织合作社，有些贫困户只好另外成立合作社；还有些骨干分子怕一般农户不好领导，只找党员团员和村干部组织合作社；这样，就出现了“富社”、“穷社”、“骨干社”。
    二、在这种情况下，就发生了争骨干、争社员、相互闹不团结、骨干盲目集中的现象。双城县庆宁村支部书记赵久长领导的互助组要建社，户数少，就到宣传委员王凤祥领导的互助组吸收组员入社；王凤祥知道了，就和赵久长吵起来，说：“你知道建社光荣，我不知道光荣？你伸出魔爪把我这组组员抓去了！”还有些组不够条件建社，其它够条件的组就到这类组去争骨干，争“硬”的社员。有些互助组的骨干一看自己的组不能建社，就抛开自己的组不管，往社里跑；他们认为领导互助组麻烦，入社以后“省心”、“领静”，“可不再当组长了！”有的七、八个组的骨干集中到一起建社；有的组其他条件都够，就是愁骨干少，办不起社来。
      三、群众自找对象的结果，有一部分暂时不愿入社的农民剩下了，没人领导；有的碰到很多困难，缺农具，缺马匹，影响生产。拜泉县华光村六个互助组，四十八户搞在一起建社，剩下二十一户没有着落；立业村李家屯剩下三十一户，只有一台车，无法进行生产。
    四、在这种情况下，富农和资本主义自发势力较严重的富裕农民，便乘机组织假互助组、假合作社。双城县希勤村富农蒋继臣、刘景山，利用小恩小惠，拉拢较困难的农民和亲戚，不叫他们入社，企图另外组织假互助组。呼兰等县有的富农和资本主义思想较严重的农民，组成了假合作社；他们说：入他们的社（指有党员、积极分子参加的社），不掉到后娘手里去了！咱们自己成立社，咱们自己说了算。他们不但排斥贫困户，而且不要党员、团员，怕他们“净说实话”。
    怎么办？
    在这些问题面前，有些县区领导方面没有及时改进领导方法和作风，影响了运动的正常发展。有些县区领导方面针对这种新的情况加强了领导，使运动比较健康地开展了起来。双城县希勤村、桦川县解放村、龙江县李地房子村，还创造出了“在党支部领导下，以村为单位，采取领导意图和群众要求相结合的方法进行全面规划”的经验。省委总结了这个经验，正在全省推广。这是保证全省农业合作化运动基本上得以健康发展的重要因素之一。
    怎样进行全面规划呢？主要是：根据领导方面初步制订的合作化计划、群众的要求和老社、准备建社的互助组的各方面条件，在进行了充分的思想教育工作之后，领导群众进行详细的讨论，确定全村开展合作化运动的规划。规划包括：发展多少新社，每个新社多少户，老社扩大多少户，还组织几个互助组；哪些群众和哪些骨干参加哪个新社，哪些群众和哪些骨干加入哪个老社，哪些群众和哪些骨干还组织几个互助组，谁和谁在一个组，谁和谁在一个社；哪些组可以在明年或后年建社，哪些组可以做为明年或后年扩社时吸收的对象。在确定计划的过程中，着重进行阶级政策教育，并根据各方面的条件，在群众自愿的原则下，适当安排贫困户加入新社或老社。经过这样全盘规划，并确定组织形式以后，原有的社和新社的建社筹备委员会分别订出增产保收和今年生产准备工作的计划，一方面领导群众实现生产计划，一方面领导群众酝酿建社扩社。在作了这些工作的基础上，成熟一批建一批，一边建社一边巩固。
    双城县希勤村就是这样做的。这个村的党支部根据全村合作化计划（原有两个老社扩大百分之四十到五十，建立六个新社，达到基本合作化），具体地帮助老社和准备建社的组制订了老社扩大和新社建立计划。两个老社根据需要和可能条件，今年要在全社百分之五十的耕地面积上使用新式畜力农具，同时发展一批牧畜；根据扩大生产的需要和各社的领导条件，“胜丰”社计划在原有三十五户基础上再发展十五户，“永丰”社计划在二十二户基础上再发展十户。六个准备建社的组，为了适应使用新式畜力农具的需要，同时照顾领导力量的条件，计划要在原有十一二匹马的基础上扩大到十八到二十匹马；因此户数也要相应地扩大到二十五户左右。同时，帮助暂时不愿入社的农户重新组织起两个互助组，做为“永丰”社和另一个社明年扩社的对象；在支部领导下，由两个社负责，常年培养。十一户要求入社的而被排斥的贫困户，在支部对社员进行教育后，也分别加入新社或老社了，大家都很满意。村干部普遍认为：这样做真好，要不就乱了，不但今年搞不好，还要影响明年。
    实践证明，合作化运动越是大规模地发展，越是需要有领导有计划有步骤地进行工作；不但省、县、区要有计划，而且各村也应当有一个比较全面和长远的计划；计划不仅包括发展新社、巩固提高老社和整顿提高互助组，同时还应包括改革技术、扩大生产、发展供销合作和信用合作事业。只有这样，才能全面推进农业社会主义改造事业。全面规划确定以后，还要进行具体的安排；在具体安排之后，新社搭起了架子，选出了筹备委员会，就可以一方面领导生产，一方面酝酿建社。
    应当注意些什么？
    根据黑龙江省推广这个经验的情况，要使区村干部正确地掌握和运用这种工作方法，应当注意这样一些事情：
    一、必须使区村干部明确地认识合作化运动大发展的形势和特点，以及在运动中必须掌握的方针和政策，使他们认识到：在农业合作社大发展的情况下，光在新建社本身的范围以内考虑问题，已经不够了。要引导他们把眼光看到全区全村，从全面推进农业合作化运动的角度出发考虑问题：既要考虑到扩大老社，也要考虑到建立新社；既要考虑到合作社的发展，也要考虑到互助组的整顿提高；既要考虑到今年，也考虑到将来；既要考虑到农业生产合作化，也考虑到其它经济工作的配合。使他们认识到：只有这样才能全面贯彻党的政策，领导合作化运动沿着正确的道路向前发展。
    二、必须使区村干部了解，要做好全面规划工作，必须做艰苦的教育工作和细致的组织工作。一方面要认识到在大发展的情况下发生的混乱现象是可以避免的，另方面也要认识要避免这些现象也不是十分容易的。在实行全面规划的时候，必须坚持领导和群众结合的群众路线的工作方法，防止发生强迫编组、编社等违反自愿原则的现象。在进行全面规划工作的时候，必须特别注意深入地广泛地全面地进行合作化政策和阶级政策的教育，提高社内社外广大群众的社会主义觉悟，提高互助合作的积极性和团结友爱走大家富裕道路的精神，提高对富农和其他破坏分子的警惕。
    三、在规划过程中，要确定社的合作化的规模大小、速度快慢，必须确切了解本村互助合作组织的原有基础和各阶层群众的真实思想情况，根据具体条件办事，绝不能只凭领导干部的热情，而不顾运动本身的规律。
    四、在整个工作过程中必须紧紧依靠党的支部，同时发挥青年团支部、妇女会、民兵队等群众组织的力量，充分运用互助合作网。
    目前看来，黑龙江省各地在推广这个经验中还有很多问题，有的对采用这种方法的重要意义仍然认识不足，有的在实行全面规划中产生了强迫命令现象，应当迅速克服和纠正。在全面规划中结合生产工作和供销信用合作工作，还只是开始作，做得还不够好，还须进一步加强。
