    Several Questions Concerning the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds

    Since the news of the issuance of the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds was published in the newspaper, many readers have written to express their enthusiastic support and active preparation for subscription. Some readers have also raised some questions in their letters, and the following are comprehensive answers:

    Q: What are the main significances of the state issuing the 1955 Economic Construction Bonds?

    A: The purpose of the state issuing economic construction bonds is to accelerate national economic construction, gradually improve the people's material and cultural living standards, and promote the habit of thrift and savings among the people. The experience of issuing bonds last year has already proven the great benefits of issuing bonds. For the state, it can concentrate the scattered money held by the people and use it for economic construction, gradually increasing the people's welfare; for the people, it is a long-term savings, in addition to recovering the principal upon maturity, they can also receive some interest and share the fruits of national construction; and politically, through the practical action of subscribing to bonds, it can also enhance the broad masses' concern and sense of responsibility for the cause of national socialist construction, further educate the masses, recognize the consistency of national interests and individual interests, and establish the virtue of thrift and savings.

    As everyone knows, our country's construction undertakings are constantly expanding, and the funds required are increasing year by year. This year, the state's investment in basic construction is about 40 percent higher than last year; and issuing bonds is one of the sources of funds for industrialization. With the development of national economic construction, the people's labor income has increased, and living standards have gradually improved. The people's savings power has also grown. Concentrating this part of the funds through the issuance of bonds can not only be invested in production in a planned way, but also help stabilize market prices. It can be seen that frequent issuance of bonds is not only necessary but also possible.

    We can take a look at the situation of bond issuance in the Soviet Union. During the three five-year plans before the war, during the Patriotic War, and in the years after the war, the Soviet Union issued bonds every year for more than 20 years. They regarded the issuance of bonds as an important financial source for economic and cultural construction, and as a major economic and political task of the state. The Soviet Union's practice is a good example for us.

    Q: Why are the planned sales figures for this bond in various strata different from those in 1954?

    A: According to the regulations of the State Council, the planned sales of the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds among workers and staff (including workers, shop assistants, government agencies, organizations and cultural and educational workers, and military cadres) is 15,000 billion yuan, an increase of 5,000 billion yuan compared to last year; the planned sales in rural areas is 18,000 billion yuan, the same as last year; and the planned sales among urban private industrialists and businessmen (including shareholders and capitalist agents), the private parties of joint state-private enterprises, and other urban residents is 27,000 billion yuan, a decrease of 5,000 billion yuan compared to last year. The above allocation figures for various strata are determined based on the current economic capacity of the people in each stratum.

    Taking workers and staff as an example, due to the needs of national economic construction and the development of production, the number of people employed has increased, wages and benefits have improved, and welfare facilities have also greatly improved. The living standards of workers, staff and public employees are gradually rising. Although the planned sales of this bond among workers and staff has increased compared to last year, the figure is not large. Calculated on the basis of the number of workers and staff in 1953, the average purchase of bonds is only more than 70,000 yuan per person; in addition, according to the materials from 19 provinces in 1954, this planned sales amount is less than 1.4 percent of the average annual wage. When issuing the 1954 bonds, the number of subscriptions from workers and staff exceeded more than double the planned sales figure; therefore, the allocation figure for this bond is certain to be oversubscribed.

    As for farmers, in recent years, under the leadership and help of the Party and the People's Government, the production of the broad masses of farmers has continuously improved, and their living standards have gradually risen. Although some rural areas suffered unprecedentedly severe floods last year, the total national grain output still increased by 3 percent compared to 1953. The bonds distributed and sold among farmers this time, excluding the population in disaster areas, average only 4,000 yuan per person, which is completely achievable.

    As for private enterprises and the private parties of joint state-private enterprises, they have all received reasonable profits in recent years, and this year they can also recover a considerable amount of the principal and interest of previously issued bonds repaid by the state. The allocated sales figure for this bond also takes into account the new changes in the proportion of public and private ownership in industrial and commercial operations, and is appropriately reduced compared to the previous time. They should continue to carry forward the spirit of patriotism and enthusiastically subscribe to the 1955 bonds.

    Q: Why is the repayment period of this bond extended to ten years in ten installments?

    A: The repayment period of this bond has been extended because the funds raised through the issuance of bonds must be used for basic construction investments that require more funds and have longer terms. As everyone knows, our country is currently concentrating its efforts on developing heavy industry in order to lay the foundation for national socialist industrialization; to develop heavy industry, long-term investment is required. Therefore, appropriately extending the term of the bonds, so that the state can utilize the funds absorbed through the bonds for a relatively long period of time, is beneficial to national construction and is also in line with the fundamental interests of the people. As for the subscribers, purchasing bonds is a form of savings, and interest can be obtained annually, so extending the term does not result in any loss. This possibility of enabling the state to utilize this fund for a longer period of time is one of the conditions for further accelerating the speed of socialist construction.

### 关于一九五五年国家经济建设公债的几个问题

    关于一九五五年国家经济建设公债的几个问题
    发行一九五五年国家经济建设公债的消息在报上公布后，很多读者来信表示热烈拥护，积极准备认购。有的读者在来信中还提出了一些问题，现在综合答复如下：
    问：国家发行一九五五年经济建设公债的意义主要的是哪些？
    答：国家发行经济建设公债的目的，是为了加速国家的经济建设，逐步提高人民物质和文化生活水平，并促进人民养成节约储蓄的习惯。去年发行公债的经验已经证明发行公债的好处很大。对国家来说，可以把闲置在人民手中的零星金钱集中起来，用到经济建设上去，逐步增进人民的福利；对人民来说，则是一种长期的储蓄，除了到期收回本金外，还可以得到若干利息，分享国家建设的果实；而且在政治上来说，通过认购公债的实际行动，还可以提高广大人民对国家社会主义建设事业的关怀和责任感，进一步教育群众，认识国家利益和个人利益的一致性，并树立起节约储蓄的美德。
    大家知道，我们国家的建设事业不断扩大，所需要的资金逐年增加，今年国家对基本建设的投资约比去年增加百分之四十以上；而发行公债正是工业化资金的来源之一。随着国家经济建设的发展，人民的劳动收入有了增加，生活水平逐步提高，人民的储蓄力量也有了增长，通过发行公债把这部分资金集中起来，既可以有计划地投资到生产上去，也有利于稳定市场物价。可见，经常发行公债不但是需要的，而且是可能的。
    我们可以看一下苏联发行公债的情况。苏联在战前三个五年计划期间、卫国战争期间和战后几年中，二十多年来年年都发行公债。他们把发行公债看作经济和文化建设的重要的财政补助源泉，当作国家的一项重大经济工作和政治工作。苏联的做法，正是我们的良好榜样。
    问：这一次公债在各阶层中的预定推销数字，为什么和一九五四年有些不同？
    答：根据国务院规定，一九五五年国家经济建设公债预定在职工（包括工人、店员、政府机关、团体和文化教育工作人员、部队干部）中推销一万五千亿元，比去年增加了五千亿元；在农村中推销一万八千亿元，和去年一样；在城市私营工商业（包括股东和资方代理人）、公私合营企业的私方及其他城市居民中推销二万七千亿元，比去年减少了五千亿元。以上对各阶层的分配数字，是根据目前各阶层人民的经济能力来确定的。
    拿职工来说，由于国家经济建设的需要和生产的发展，劳动就业的人数有所增加，工资待遇有所提高，福利设施也有了很大的改善，职工和公教人员的生活水平都在逐步上升。这一次公债在职工中预定推销额虽然比去年增加了，但数字是不大的。如按一九五三年职工人数计算，每人平均不过购买公债七万余元；另外根据一九五四年十九个省的材料估算，这个预定推销额还不到一年平均工资的百分之一点四。在发行一九五四年的公债时，职工认购数超过了预定推销数字的一倍多；因此，这次公债的分配数字，是一定能够超额认购的。
    以农民来说，几年来广大农民在党和人民政府的领导、帮助下，生产不断提高，生活逐步上升。去年部分农村虽然遭受了空前严重的水灾，但是全国粮食总产量仍然比一九五三年增加了百分之三。这次分配在农民中推销的公债，除去受灾地区的人口外，每人平均不过四千元，是完全可以完成的。
    以私营企业和公私合营企业的私方来说，几年来都得到了合理的利润，今年还可以收回相当数量的国家偿付的过去发行的公债本息。这次公债的分配推销数字，又照顾到工商业经营上公私比重的新变化，比上一次适当减少。他们应该继续发扬爱国主义精神，踊跃认购一九五五年的公债。
    问：这一次公债为什么延长为分十年作十次偿还本金？
    答：这一次公债偿还的期限延长了，是因为通过发行公债筹集来的资金必须用于需款较多、期限较长的基本建设投资。大家知道，目前我们国家正集中力量发展重工业，以奠定国家社会主义工业化的基础；要发展重工业，就需要长期的投资。因此，把公债的期限适当延长，使国家能够比较长期地利用通过公债吸收的这项资金，对国家建设是有利的，也是符合人民的根本利益的。至于对认购人来说，购买公债是一种储蓄，按年可以取得息金，期限放长一些，也并没有损失。这种使国家更长期地利用这项资金的可能性，是进一步加速社会主义建设速度的条件之一。
