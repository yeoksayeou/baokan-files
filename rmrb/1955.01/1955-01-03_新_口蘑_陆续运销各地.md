    New "White Mushrooms" Continuously Transported and Sold to Various Regions
    The new "White Mushrooms" produced in the Zhangjiakou area of Hebei Province last year are being continuously transported and sold to various regions. According to incomplete statistics from the Zhangjiakou Special District Office of the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, as of December 27th last year, more than 20,000 jin of "White Mushrooms" had been shipped to Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, Shenyang, Harbin and other places.
    The mushrooms produced in the Zhangjiakou area are delicious and well-known in major cities. Since liberation, the production of "White Mushrooms" has been increasing steadily. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang in 1948, the annual output of "White Mushrooms" was only over 30,000 jin. After the local liberation in 1949, the output increased to 60,000 jin, and in 1950 it increased to over 80,000 jin. This year's harvest was not good, but it is estimated that there are still 70,000 to 80,000 jin. (Zhang Zu)

    新“口蘑”陆续运销各地
    河北省张家口地区去年出产的新“口蘑”正陆续运销各地。据河北省供销合作社张家口专区办事处不完全的统计，到去年十二月二十七日，运往北京、天津、青岛、沈阳、哈尔滨等地的“口蘑”已经有两万多斤。
    张家口地区出产的蘑菇，味道鲜美，驰名各大城市。解放以后，“口蘑”产量陆续增加。一九四八年国民党反动统治时期，“口蘑”年产量仅三万多斤，一九四九年当地解放以后，产量增加到六万斤，一九五零年增加到八万多斤；今年收成不好，估计仍有七、八万斤。（张组）
