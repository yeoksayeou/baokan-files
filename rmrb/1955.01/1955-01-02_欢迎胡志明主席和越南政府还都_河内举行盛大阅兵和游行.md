Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 1st: This reporter reports: The first of the month was the day the people of Hanoi welcomed Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam back to the capital. This evergreen city has become even more beautiful because of the people's joy.

　　Early in the morning, endless streams of people carrying red flags poured out of the streets and alleys of Hanoi and headed for Ba Dinh Park, where the grand celebration of the return to the capital was to be held. In order to see Chairman Ho, farmers from the suburbs got up in the dark and happily rushed to Hanoi with dry food. Tens of thousands of people came with joy and excitement from the northern provinces of Vietnam, and even from the French army's temporary garrison areas such as Haiphong, to see Chairman Ho and the grand military parade and procession.

　　The newly built rostrum, grandstand, and square in Ba Dinh Park, surrounded by green trees and red flags, looked solemn and beautiful. Nine years ago, Chairman Ho Chi Minh read the Vietnamese Declaration of Independence here.

　　At 9:55, Ho Chi Minh, General Secretary of the Vietnam Workers' Party Truong Chinh, Deputy Prime Minister Pham Van Dong, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnam People's Army Vo Nguyen Giap, and others stepped onto the rostrum. Thunderous applause and cheers rang out from the grandstand among the more than 1,000 representatives from all over Vietnam and foreign guests.

　　After Chairman Ho Chi Minh's speech and Commander-in-Chief Vo Nguyen Giap's inspection of the troops and reading of orders, the majestic military parade of the People's Army began. Combat heroes who had made outstanding achievements in previous battles marched proudly at the front, followed by neat rows of infantry. Among them were heroic troops who bravely defended Hanoi eight years ago, fighting the French invading army with simple weapons for nearly two months; and troops who fought arduously in the forests and rubber plantations of southern Vietnam, and finally strengthened themselves with the enemy's weapons. The infantry accepting the review held various weapons captured from the French army in the anti-colonialist war, many of which were American weapons.

　　Local troops and guerrillas from all over Vietnam then accepted the review. People paid special attention to the famous Hoang Ngan female guerrilla team and the Viet Bac female guerrilla team, who, like men, fought the French army in jungles and mountains. Almost everyone in the Hoang Ngan female guerrilla team wore brilliant medals, and the Viet Bac female guerrilla team were all armed with American-made carbines.

　　Mechanized infantry, air defense forces, and artillery forces passed in front of the rostrum. The artillery formation was entirely composed of captured American-made mountain guns and howitzers. At this time, the crowd in the grandstand became even more excited, and the cheers drowned out the rumbling of the motors.

　　The mass procession of hundreds of thousands of people began. The workers' honor guard, holding portraits and eighty huge red flags, led the way. The marching masses also held aloft portraits of Chairman Malenkov, Chairman Mao Zedong, and other leaders of fraternal countries. The colorful crowd was like a long rainbow, like a stream covered with flowers.

　　Workers and peasants from Hanoi and other places participating in the parade celebrated Chairman Ho's and the government's return to the capital with their production achievements. Workers from the Hanoi Railway Bureau manufactured a huge locomotive model and held up a sign that read "Rapidly Restore the Railway"; coal miners held up charts showing their proud production increases; and restorers of the Bai Thuong sluice gate in Thanh Hoa Province specially made a model of the bedrock sluice gate they had recently restored and rushed to participate in the parade. Among the nearly 30,000 peasants, peasants from the suburbs of Hanoi held up models of rice, coconuts, pineapples, etc., expressing their determination to increase production as a gift to Chairman Ho. On the charts they held high, it was written: Since the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam, farmers north of the Fourth Interzone alone have reclaimed more than 28,000 Vietnamese acres of wasteland.

　　After the contingents of South Vietnamese residents evacuated from the south to the north, ethnic minority contingents from all over Vietnam, Hanoi citizens, and students, a cultural and artistic contingent of 700 people passed in front of the rostrum, performing graceful dances in front of the rostrum. The parade ended at 2:30 p.m. At the same time as the parade, 100,000 residents listened to the live broadcast of the conference on the shore of Hoan Kiem Lake and in front of the railway station.

　　On the night of the 1st, beautiful Hanoi looked even more moving. The gently rippling Hoan Kiem Lake was illuminated by thousands of colorful electric lights, and the tower in the center of the lake was illuminated by the lights, making it look like jade. As soon as night fell, various fireworks rose into the air, like clusters of brilliant silver flowers, like countless strings of sparkling beads. People from all over the country sang and danced under them until late at night.

    欢迎胡志明主席和越南政府还都
    河内举行盛大阅兵和游行
    【新华社河内一日电】本报记者报道：一日是河内人民欢迎胡志明主席和越南民主共和国政府还都的日子。这个四季常青的城市因为人民的欢欣而变得更加美丽了。
    一清早，绵延不绝的人流打着红旗从河内的各个街巷涌出来，向庆祝还都大典的巴亭公园走去。为了看望胡主席，郊区农民在黑夜里便起来，带着干粮兴高采烈地赶向河内城。还有成千成万的人带着欢愉和激动的心情，从越北各省、甚至从海防等法国军队的暂时驻扎区赶来看胡主席，看阅兵和游行的盛况。
    新建的座落在巴亭公园的主席台、观礼台和广场在绿树和红旗的环绕之中，显得庄严美丽。在九年以前，胡志明主席曾在这里宣读越南独立宣言。
    九时五十五分，胡志明主席、越南劳动党总书记长征、范文同副总理、越南人民军总司令武元甲等走上主席台。在观礼台上来自越南各地的一千多名代表和各国来宾中间响起了春雷般的掌声和欢呼声。
    在胡志明主席讲话和武元甲总司令检阅部队和宣读命令之后，雄壮的人民军部队分列式开始了。在历次战斗中建立了卓越功勋的战斗英雄们威武地走在前面，接着是整齐的步兵行列。这里有在八年前英勇地保卫河内，用简单的武器同法国侵略军搏斗近两个月的英雄部队；有在越南南部的森林和橡胶种植园中艰苦作战、终于用敌军的武器壮大了自己的部队。接受检阅的步兵拿着在反对殖民主义的战争中从法军手中缴获的各种武器，其中有不少是美国武器。
    越南各地的地方军和游击队接着接受检阅。人们特别注意著名的黄银女游击队和越北女游击队，她们曾经和男子一样，在丛林和山野中和法军作战。在黄银女游击队中几乎每个人都佩戴着灿烂的勋章，而越北女游击队也全部拿着美制卡宾枪了。　　机械化步兵、防空部队和炮兵部队通过主席台前。炮兵队列中全部是缴获的美制山炮和榴弹炮，这时，观礼的人群更加兴奋了，欢呼声淹没了隆隆的马达声。
　十几万人的群众游行队伍开始了。工人仪仗队高举着画像和八十面巨幅红旗为前导，游行的群众还高举着马林科夫主席、毛泽东主席和其他兄弟国家领袖的画像。彩色缤纷的人流像一道长虹，像布满鲜花的溪流。　　参加游行的河内和各地工人、农民用自己的生产成绩庆祝胡主席和政府还都。河内铁路局工人制造了巨大的机车模型并举着“迅速恢复铁路”的标语；煤矿工人举着他们引为骄傲的增产图表，远在清化省的拜上水闸修复者也特地做了一个他们不久前修复的磐石水闸的模型，赶来参加游行。在近三万人的农民队伍里，河内郊区的农民高举着稻米、椰子、菠萝等的模型，表示一定努力增加生产，作为对胡主席的献礼。在他们高抬着的图表上写着：仅在越南停战以后，自第四联区以北的农民便开垦了两万八千多越亩的荒地。　　在从南部北撤的南越居民队伍、越南各地少数民族队伍、河内市民、学生的队伍之后，由七百人组成的文艺大队通过主席台前，他们在主席台前表演了优美的舞蹈。游行直到下午两点三十分结束。在游行的同时，十万居民在还剑湖滨和火车站前，聆听了大会的实况广播。
    一日夜晚，美丽的河内显得更加动人了。微波荡漾的还剑湖被千百盏彩色电灯照耀着，湖中心的塔被灯光映照得像玉琢一样的玲珑剔透。夜幕刚刚降下，各种焰火便腾空而起，像一团团灿烂的银花，像无数串晶莹的珠珞。来自各地的人民在这下面尽情歌舞，直到深夜。
