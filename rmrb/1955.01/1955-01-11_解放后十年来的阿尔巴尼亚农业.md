    Albanian Agriculture in the Decade After Liberation
    Ge. Dasko, Deputy Minister of Agriculture of Albania
    The Albanian people have been liberated from generations of enslavement for a full decade. In these ten years, the Albanian people have finally stopped working for that small group of exploiters and are working for themselves. In these ten years, thanks to the political, economic, and social transformations carried out in Albania under the direct leadership of the Labor Party, the face of the country has completely changed. After expelling the Nazi fascist invaders and crushing the traitors, the people's regime carried out the greatest land reform, thus overturning feudal relations in the countryside and eliminating feudal land ownership. The land of landlords, feudal lords, and the wealthy was expropriated, and the land was transferred to the working peasants. This was the day that Albanian peasants had dreamed of for generations. In the past, Albanian peasants had struggled and shed blood to obtain the right to live and their own land; however, at that time, their efforts were in vain because their struggle lacked correct and strong leadership. It was only in October 1917, when the great Russian People's Revolution had made the whole world know that it was possible to eliminate the landlord class and give the land to those who cultivate it, that a great hope was born in the hearts of the Albanian peasants. Therefore, when the Albanian Communist Party was founded on November 8, 1941, and issued a call to the people to fight the occupiers, the working peasants immediately and happily responded to the call, because they knew that the Party would give them what the Soviet Communist Party had given to the Soviet working peasants.
    The land reform, implemented with the decree promulgated in August 1945, gave more than 73,000 landless and land-poor households (almost half of the country's working peasants) the long-awaited land and a portion of olive trees, draught animals, and houses from the people's regime without compensation.
    The Albanian peasants, who changed from oppressed peasants to free landowners, also changed their attitude towards labor. With the great help of the state, they began to expand the sown area and increase the yield per unit area. The sown area in 1946 increased by 20 percent compared with 1938, the year before the fascist occupation of Albania, while in 1954 it increased by 69 percent compared with 1938.
    The state-owned part of agriculture—state farms—was established on the vast land occupied by local traitors and foreign lessees confiscated by the people's regime. In the past, there was no state-owned part of agriculture at all. This state-owned part is constantly developing, and now its cultivated area has more than doubled compared with 1945. The state-owned part of agriculture is one of the forms of the state helping the working peasants. It supplies good breeds of livestock, excellent seeds, etc., to the working peasants. At the same time, it is also a remarkable example of the huge socialist economy and ownership. According to advanced science, especially the world's most advanced Soviet science, agriculture and animal husbandry have been well developed.
    Land reform in agriculture has made it possible to establish another new form of socialist agriculture—agricultural cooperatives. As early as 1946, the first seven such cooperatives were established, and now there are 128 such cooperatives. In these cooperatives, farmers unite their land and other means of production, cultivate collectively, and distribute income according to the amount of work of each labor day as required by socialist principles. The members of agricultural cooperatives, those who were formerly oppressed by feudal landlords, have greatly improved their material conditions by increasing the yield per unit area. The yield per unit area of cooperative crops is much higher than that of the same crops in the individual economy. For example, in 1954, the yield per unit area of wheat in cooperatives was 24 percent higher than that of wheat in the individual economy, while in 1953, the yield per unit area of sugar beets and cotton was 140 percent and 65 percent higher than that of the individual economy, respectively. The "Sickle and Hammer" agricultural cooperative in Dules Prefecture harvested 21.2 quintals of wheat per hectare on all their non-irrigated wheat sowing land, while the Liumaras cooperative in Kalchi Prefecture harvested 362 quintals per hectare on all their sugar beet sowing land in 1953. The material and cultural life of cooperative members has been improved unprecedentedly. They have reading rooms and clubs. Their former thatched huts covered with mud and wheat straw have now been replaced by beautiful and comfortable houses, and electric lights have been turned on in many such houses.
    Now, thanks to the great help of the state, individual farmers are also developing their individual economy. After believing in the superiority of this socialist economic form, they will soon become members of cooperatives. In 1953 alone, more than 1,000 individual farmers and cooperative members received government rewards for their high yields.
    The government provides farmers with huge agricultural loans every year, supplying them with various high-quality seeds. The state's significant assistance to farmers is also realized through machine tractor stations that have modern tractors, combine harvesters, and other state-of-the-art Soviet agricultural machinery. These machine tractor stations have increased their workload by nearly seven times compared to 1948.
    A series of soil improvement works carried out after liberation, such as drying the soil, building irrigation and drainage canals, significantly improved the land and increased its fertility. The area of irrigated land in 1954 was more than double that of 1938.
    After liberation, the agriculture of the People's Republic of Albania has been significantly expanded and developed; now, our fields are planted with valuable technical crops that people did not know much about or did not know at all in the past. Therefore, compared with 1938, the output of cotton has increased to 60 times, tobacco has increased to 9.4 times, and as for the crop sugar beet, which our farmers did not know before, it has increased to 1,217 percent, ensuring the raw material supply for our young sugar industry. Significant achievements have also been made in planting valuable fruit trees, the climate of Albania is very conducive to planting these fruit trees, including: olive trees, lemon trees, orange trees, fig trees, apple trees, etc.
    The war and the Nazi fascist occupation brought huge losses to Albanian animal husbandry. Now, thanks to the help of the Party and the state, Albanian animal husbandry has embarked on a path of progress. In order to improve the breeds of cattle, horses, sheep, pigs, and other types of livestock, an animal research center has now been established, and the breeding station network has spread throughout the country. In order to take various measures to increase the total number of livestock, the Party and the government issued special resolutions, which proves the Party and the government's constant concern and attention to our country's animal husbandry.
    After the liberation of the motherland, all working farmers set about continuously increasing the production of agriculture and animal husbandry in order to be able to give the people more products. For our country, the large-scale participation of women and the mobilization of young people in agricultural work are now a characteristic.
    Especially thanks to the help of the Agricultural Research Institute established in Tirana after liberation, scientific work in agriculture is constantly expanding. a senior agricultural college and three agricultural technical schools are training intermediate and senior cadres. There is a vast network of agricultural training classes in various regions, in which agronomists teach farmers advanced agricultural techniques.
    Although great achievements have been made in this regard in the past ten years, there are still major tasks facing the working farmers. They are embarking on these tasks with confidence and are confident of achieving new victories because they know that the Labor Party is correctly and constantly leading them, and the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries are giving them selfless assistance. The past decade is a reliable guarantee of future achievements.

    解放后十年来的阿尔巴尼亚农业
    阿尔巴尼亚农业部副部长　格·达斯柯
    阿尔巴尼亚人民从世世代代的奴役下解放出来已经满十年了。在这十年里，阿尔巴尼亚人民终于不再为那一小撮剥削人的人工作，而是为自己工作了。在这十年里，由于阿尔巴尼亚在劳动党的直接领导下过去和现在所进行的政治、经济和社会的改造，国家的面貌完全改变了。人民政权在驱逐纳粹法西斯侵略者和粉碎卖国贼以后，进行了最伟大的土地改革，这样就推翻了农村中的封建关系，从而也消灭了封建的土地所有制。大地主、封建主和富豪的土地被剥夺了，土地转交给了劳动农民。这是阿尔巴尼亚农民世世代代所想望的日子。在过去，阿尔巴尼亚农民为了获得生活权利和自己的土地，曾经进行了斗争，并且流了血；但是，在那个时期，他们的努力是徒劳的，因为当时他们的斗争缺乏正确和坚强的领导。只是在一九一七年十月，当伟大的俄国人民革命已让全世界知道，消灭地主阶级、把土地交给耕种土地的人是可能的时候，阿尔巴尼亚的农民的心中才产生了巨大的希望。因此，当一九四一年十一月八日阿尔巴尼亚共产党成立，并向人民发出同占领者作战的号召的时候，劳动农民立刻愉快地响应了号召，因为他们知道，党将给他们以苏联共产党给予苏联劳动农民的东西。
    随着一九四五年八月颁布的法令而实行的土地改革，七万三千多无地和少地的农户（几乎占全国劳动农民的一半）无代价地从人民政权那里得到了渴望很久的土地和一部分橄榄树、役畜和房屋。
    从被压迫的农民变为自由的土地主人的阿尔巴尼亚农民，同样也改变了自己对劳动的态度。在国家巨大的帮助下，他们开始扩大播种面积，并提高单位面积产量。一九四六年的播种面积同法西斯占领阿尔巴尼亚的前一年一九三八年相比，增加了百分之二十，而一九五四年则比一九三八年增加了百分之六十九。
      农业的国营部分——国营农场是在被人民政权没收的当地卖国者、外国承租者占有的巨大土地上建立起来的，而在过去农业的国营部分是根本没有的。这个国营部分正在不断地发展起来，现在它的耕地面积已比一九四五年增加了一倍。农业的国营部分是国家帮助劳动农民的形式之一，它把良种牲畜、优良种籽及其他等等供给劳动农民，同时它也是巨大的社会主义经济和所有制的显著范例，它根据先进科学，特别是世界最先进的苏联科学，使农业和畜牧业都获得了很好的发展。
    农业中的土地改革，使建立社会主义农业的另一新形式——农业合作社成为可能。早在一九四六年就已经建立了第一批七个这样的合作社，而现在已有了一百二十八个这样的合作社了。在这些合作社里，农民把自己的土地和其他生产资料联合在一起，集体耕作，并且依照社会主义原则所要求的按照每一个劳动日的工作量分配收益。农业合作社的社员，那些从前受封建地主压迫的人，现在由于提高了单位面积产量，已大大地改善了自己的物质状况。合作社农作物的单位面积产量，大大超过了个体经济中同类农作物的单位面积产量，例如，一九五四年合作社的小麦单位面积产量高出个体经济的小麦单位面积产量百分之二十四，而一九五三年甜菜和棉花的单位面积产量则比个体经济分别超过百分之一百四十和百分之六十五。杜列斯州的“镰刀和锤子”农业合作社在他们全部没有灌溉的小麦播种地上，每公顷收获了二十一点二公担小麦，而卡尔契州的留马拉斯合作社，一九五三年在他们全部甜菜播种地上，每公顷收获了三百六十二公担。合作社社员的物质和文化生活空前地改善了。他们有了阅览室、俱乐部，他们从前的用泥土和麦秸盖的茅舍，现在已由美丽和舒适的房屋所代替，在许多这样的房子里，已经点起了电灯。
    现在，由于国家的巨大帮助，就是个体农民也在发展着自己的个体经济，他们在相信了这种社会主义经济形式的优越性后，不久的将来也会成为合作社的社员的。仅在一九五三年内就有一千个以上的个体农民和合作社社员由于高额产量而获得了政府的奖励。
    政府每年都给农民以巨额的农业贷款，供给他们以各种优良的种籽。国家对农民的重大帮助也通过拥有现代化拖拉机、联合收割机和其他各种最新式的苏联农业机器的机器拖拉机站来实现。这些机器拖拉机站已把自己的工作量比一九四八年提高了几近七倍。
    解放后进行的一连串的土壤改良工作，像使土壤干燥，修筑灌溉和排水的运河，显著地改良了土地和增加了土地的肥沃程度。一九五四年被灌溉的土地面积比一九三八年增加了两倍以上。
    解放后，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的农业，显著地扩大和发展了；现在，我国的田野上种植着从前人们不大知道或者根本不知道的贵重的技术作物。因此，同一九三八年相比，棉花的产量增加到六十倍，烟草增加到九点四倍，至于我们农民从前不知道的作物甜菜，则增加到百分之一千二百一十七，保证了我们年轻的制糖工业的原料供应。在种植贵重的果木树方面也同样获得了显著的成就，阿尔巴尼亚的气候很利于种植这些果木树，其中包括：橄榄树、柠檬树、橘子树、无花果树、苹果树等等。
    战争和纳粹法西斯的占领，给阿尔巴尼亚畜牧业带来了巨大的损失。现在，由于党和国家的帮助，阿尔巴尼亚畜牧业已走上了进步的道路。为了改良牛、马、羊、猪和其他种类牲畜的品种，现在建立了动物学研究中心，而配种站网则遍及全国。为了采取增加牲畜总数的各种措施，党和政府颁发了特别的决议，这证明了党和政府对我国畜牧业不断的关怀和重视。
    祖国解放后，全体劳动农民着手不断地提高农业和畜牧业的生产，以便有可能给予人民更多的产品。对于我国说来，农业工作中妇女的大规模参加和青年的动员在现在乃是一个特点。
    特别是由于解放后在地拉那设立的农业研究所的帮助，农业中的科学工作正在不断地扩展，一所高级农业专科学校和三所农业技术学校正在培养着中级和高级干部。各地区都有广大的农业训练班网，在这些训练班中，农艺师教授农民以先进的农业技术。
    虽然十年来在这方面获得了巨大的成就，然而仍有重大的任务摆在劳动农民面前。他们满怀着信心来着手完成这些任务，并确信会获得新的胜利，因为他们知道，劳动党在正确地和不断地领导着他们，苏联和各人民民主国家给予他们大公无私的援助。过去的十年就是未来的成就的可靠保障。
