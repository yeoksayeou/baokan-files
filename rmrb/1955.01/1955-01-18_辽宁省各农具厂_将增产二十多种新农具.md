Liaoning Province Farm Implement Factories
Will Increase Production of More Than Twenty New Farm Implements

	This year, state-owned and locally state-owned farm implement factories in Liaoning Province will increase the production of more than twenty new farm implements to support agricultural production. The state-owned Lingshan Farm Implement Factory, Liaoning Farm Implement Factory, Dalian Farm Implement Factory, and farm implement factories in Fengcheng, Xifeng, and other places will respectively produce double-wheeled double-share plows, weeder-hoes, rollers, seeders, disc harrows, harvesters, corn threshers, and rice threshers this year. The state-owned Lingshan Farm Implement Factory plans to produce more than 40,000 double-wheeled double-share plows. The production volume of weeder-hoes at the Dalian Farm Implement Factory and Fengcheng County Farm Implement Factory will increase by more than threefold compared to last year (in addition to meeting the needs of this province, they will also supply the rural areas of Inner Mongolia). According to the expansion of the area for rice cultivation this year, the farm implement factories in Xifeng, Zhuanghe, and other counties will increase the number of rice threshers produced from 479 units last year to 690 units. In order to cooperate with this year's spring plowing production, the Liaoning Provincial Department of Industry plans to dispatch technical personnel from some farm implement factories in the first quarter to form farm implement repair work groups to help farmers repair farm implements in the countryside.

    辽宁省各农具厂
    将增产二十多种新农具
    辽宁省国营和地方国营农具厂今年将增产二十多种新农具，支援农业生产。国营灵山农具厂、辽宁农具厂、旅大市农具厂以及凤城、西丰等地农具厂，将在今年分别生产双轮双铧犁、铲?机、镇压器、播种机、圆盘耙、收割机、玉米脱粒机和打稻机等。国营灵山农具厂准备生产出四万余具双轮双铧犁，旅大市农具厂和凤城县农具厂铲?机的生产量将比去年增加三倍多（除供应本省需要外还将供应内蒙地区农村），西丰、庄河等县的农具厂根据农民今年耕种水稻面积扩大的情况，生产打稻机的数量也将由去年的四百七十九台增加到六百九十台。辽宁省工业厅为配合今年的春耕生产，准备在第一季度抽调一些农具厂的技术人员，组成农具修理工作组，到农村帮助农民修理农具。
