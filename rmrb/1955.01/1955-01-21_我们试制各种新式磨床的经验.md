    Our Experiences in Trial-Manufacturing Various New Types of Grinding Machines
    Ai Ding, Director of Shanghai Machine Tool Plant
    Shanghai Machine Tool Plant specializes in manufacturing grinding machines. Grinding machines are relatively precise machine tools and have a wide range of applications in industrial construction.

    Before Liberation, the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant could only manufacture simple agricultural tools such as hoes and ploughs and repair some machine parts. Since Liberation, it has successively trial-manufactured and produced eight types of grinding machines and one horizontal boring machine, including five new Soviet-style grinding machines made in 1954. There are four more under trial manufacture, and the number of trial-manufactured machines will increase to more than ten in 1955. The speed of trial manufacture has increased from one per year to one per month. The requirements for precision are also getting higher and higher. These new products have been supplied and will continue to be supplied to heavy industrial construction units all over the country, including Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, and the Tractor Manufacturing Plant.

    Organizing Production Order by Implementing Operation Plans

    Until the first half of 1954, our factory's products were still singular and not very diverse. Moreover, the specifications of these products were old and did not meet the needs of the country, so hundreds of machines were backlogged. In the second half of last year, under the leadership of our superiors, we bravely revised the original plan for 1954 based on the principle of producing whatever the country needed, resolutely reducing the old products in the original plan that did not meet the needs of the country and increasing the new products needed by the country—from two types to five.

    With the increase in products, how to rationally organize the production order in the workshop to ensure the timely completion of the trial production tasks of new products and the timely end of the production of old products?

    We first started by rectifying the production operation plan in the workshop and learning from the experience of brother factories in organizing operation plans for single, small-batch production.

    Our operational planning foundation was very poor: the old labor organization was divided into joint work sections according to technological characteristics, the parts could not be processed within one work section, there were many cross-workshop and cross-work section operations, the quality responsibility was unclear, the flow of work-in-progress could not be controlled, and sometimes the number of parts coming and going was not counted, resulting in discrepancies in the numbers. The people who made the plans also had no confidence, thinking that making plans was just "for show" and "do it and see." These backward and inconsistent practices would not work after trial-producing new products and organizing multi-variety production.

    With the specific help of the working group sent by the superiors, we first analyzed the parts drawings of the machine tools and established four processing workshops based on the characteristics of the parts shapes, including nine specialized work sections. Each specialized work section is responsible for processing a certain type of parts. The assembly workshop is organized into four specialized work sections based on the principle of product objects, so that each specialized work section is responsible for assembling all models of machine tools within the same product series. The adjusted labor organization greatly reduced the processing of parts and assembly operations across work sections and workshops, and restricted the activities of work-in-progress within a certain range. In this way, the responsibility is very clear, and technical experience is easier to accumulate, which creates extremely favorable conditions for compiling operation plans and makes the implementation of the responsibility system have practical work content.

      There are thousands of parts flowing in the processing workshop. If the plan is not arranged well, there will be chaos. Here, we focus on two types of operation plans, namely the monthly plan and the day and night shift plan. When compiling the monthly plan, we should focus on ensuring that the output indicators of various types of parts meet the needs of assembly. The day and night shift plan can adjust the changes that occur due to insufficient estimates in the monthly plan. With the adjustment of the day and night shift plan, the monthly plan will not "fail," and with the guidance of the monthly plan, the day and night shift plan will not "go astray." The workshop and work section leaders grasped the multi-variety production through the operation plan. Organizing production with planning broke the initial concerns about organizing multi-variety production. The assembly workshop compiles a "series product assembly alternation schedule," which indicates the sequence of parts required for each assembly process, and organizes the needs of the assembly workshop and the supply of the processing workshop, preventing the phenomenon of missing or backlog of parts.

    The compilation of the operation plan must be based on the production characteristics of each workshop in order to play the role of organizing production. At the same time, in order to improve the economic effect of the operation plan, we began to issue six technical and economic indicators to the workshop from the third quarter of last year, including total production, waste loss, labor productivity, tool damage, personnel wage quota, and auxiliary material consumption, in order to measure the advancement of the operation plan and as a goal for labor competition. The formulation of these indicators should take into account the tightness of the man-hour quota, the proportion of new and old products, the difficulty of operation, the level of workers' technical skills, and the amount of material input, etc. Generally, they are indicators that workers must work hard to complete in order to encourage and improve work. After the indicators were issued, a regular inspection system was established, and the workshop also established visualized instruction charts to publicize the completion of the indicators by each worker, so that workers can understand in time and supervise each other to strive to complete the plan.

    Starting from Strengthening Production Technology Preparation, Expanding Multi-Variety Production

    After switching from batch production of a single variety to small-batch production of multiple varieties, the original set of production technology preparation work also seemed to be unable to keep up. We then organized all the technical preparation work in a planned way according to the trial production tasks. The planning of production technology preparation work is also the planning of department work. Therefore, we successively adjusted the organization of the departments and transferred manpower to strengthen the technical departments. Within the design department, various design teams were established according to the product series; in addition, a production service team was established to be responsible for solving various problems existing in the drawings during the small-batch and batch production stages of new products after trial production, so as to ensure that the development of varieties and the current production are taken care of. In the construction department, main product construction workers were added so that a special person is responsible for the entire process of each new product to ensure product quality. In the production department, a production preparation planning team was established to fully grasp the progress of various preparation work in the trial production of new products. The organization of the tool department was also adjusted accordingly. We also established a standardization team according to the suggestions of Soviet experts. Under the leadership of the chief engineer, we planned and executed the standardization of various product parts and tool and fixture parts in the factory, simplified various design work, and improved economic results.

    In order to overcome the irregular habits left over from the colonial mechanical industrial repair era and eliminate the passive confusion and incoordination caused by the lack of a complete system of technical management, we also established several necessary working systems. The establishment of these systems is mainly to clarify responsibilities, ensure quality, and compress the cycle, and requires that the preparation work before various production tasks be done well and in a timely manner. In the process of planning production technology preparation work, two points must be grasped: first, give full play to the initiative of the departments. To this end, it is stipulated that the factory-level should control large projects, and each department should control detailed projects. Second, promote various advanced experiences to compress the time for preparation work. For example, when trial-producing the CK371 surface grinder, the cycle was shortened by three to four months due to the use of the "parallel staggered" working method. For example, after the standardization and specification of product parts design were implemented, five products have now adopted unified standard parts. These unified standard parts only need to be designed once by the technical department, instead of designing every part in every new machine tool and formulating process regulations like in the past, which greatly simplifies the work, shortens the preparation time, and relatively improves the quality of the work. In terms of material supply, standardization work has also been carried out.

    Relying on the Leadership of the Party, Mobilizing the Masses to Overcome Difficulties

    When trial-manufacturing new products, we encountered many difficult problems, but each time we relied on the leadership of the Party, mobilized the masses, and combined technical and organizational measures to overcome the difficulties. When we revised the 1954 production plan, some employees did not understand the significance of increasing new varieties, but only saw that the quantity of products that had already been backlogged was reduced, so they believed that revising the plan was in conflict with socialist industrialization and their morale was not high. The Party organization combined the publicity of the general line to explain to the employees the positive significance of changing the plan, explaining that increasing new products, appropriately undertaking miscellaneous tasks, and not accumulating state funds is the specific implementation of the national industrialization policy. When starting to prepare for the production technology of new products, most of the engineering and technical personnel were very enthusiastic, but when they were asked to speed up the preparation time by one time compared with the preparation time for old products in the past, they were afraid that the technical strength was weak and they could not cope with it. In addition to appropriately adjusting the organization and rationally dividing the work, we also organized the study of Soviet and advanced regions' experiences and the instructions of the superiors, especially the factory organized relevant section chiefs to fully discuss and specifically deploy the arrangement of each work; combined with special meetings, assisted in solving the business problems of the sections, and greatly improved labor efficiency. For example, the design department used to take 18 or 19 hours to design a part drawing, but now it only takes 11 hours; since the second half of last year, it has been able to complete all the drawings of a new machine tool in one month.

    Organizing multi-variety production is also a new management problem for the leading cadres in the workshop. The workshop directors are all promoted from workers. They are proficient in specific production technology, but it is a tricky task to manage thousands of parts and tens of thousands of processes and arrange production in an orderly manner. The task of the Party organization is to help them break down old ideas on the one hand and improve their confidence on the other, and require them to humbly learn plan management. The standard parts workshop is one of the processing workshops. There are thousands of parts. The workshop director was once distressed because he could not manage it and had no idea, and expressed his unwillingness to do leadership work. However, after the Party branch in the workshop helped and the factory sent people to assist in the implementation of the operation plan, he said: "The work-in-progress in the workshop can be grasped by 95%."

    The workers initially had three major concerns about trial-manufacturing new products: first, they were not used to it. For example, in the past, drawing symbols were all in English letters, but now they have been changed to Russian letters, and they cannot understand them; second, the Soviet drawing standards have strict requirements and high quality requirements, and they are afraid that the technology will not keep up; third, they are afraid that they will not meet the quota and will not get bonuses. Based on these situations, the Party organization and the trade union cooperated with the administration to organize workers to study Soviet advanced technology and experience from a positive perspective, organized engineering and technical personnel to introduce the structure and performance of new machine tools to workers, explained Soviet technical standards, and held Russian alphabet learning classes in addition to conducting ideological education. The trade union production committee organized veteran workers to collectively solve difficult workpieces in the construction process. The Party organization studied and solved key problems in production technology with workers and engineering technicians through production meetings, launched personal planning and labor competitions, and ensured the completion and over-fulfillment of quota plans. This greatly improved the confidence of the workers and produced many advanced working methods. Trade union workers Zhang Xibao and Yuan Zhangqing put forward rationalization proposals for automatic retractors and screw turning; turner Zhang Yujin implemented the diamond knife layering method; milling worker Li Yongshun implemented the improved milling cutter with diamond knife high-speed boring method; casting worker Chen Fenglin used the parting mold molding method to cast large parts, and the efficiency increased by two times; veteran workers in the standard parts workshop and the sleeve workshop collectively researched the swirl cutting screw method, and workers in the casting workshop collectively researched the cold pump sand flushing method, and so on. The technical level of workers is also constantly improving. At the factory-wide employee conference held in mid-December 1954, more than 400 outstanding employees were rewarded, including 177 workers who completed the annual production quota ahead of schedule in November, such as milling worker Li Yongshun who completed one year, nine months and twelve days of the quota; labor model turner Sheng Li completed one year, eight months and one day of the quota. In addition, 256 technicians, clerks, auxiliary workers and odd-job workers were also rewarded. We have been conducting multi-variety production for a short time, and the achievements we have made are not solid. We will trial-manufacture more new varieties and have heavier tasks this year. In particular, we still lack the knowledge of scientific enterprise management, so we must further strengthen the advanced experience of learning Soviet socialist enterprise management on the existing basis, strengthen planning, and improve manufacturing technology to manufacture more new products for socialist industrialization.

    我们试制各种新式磨床的经验
    上海机床厂厂长　艾丁
    上海机床厂是专门制造磨床的。磨床是比较精密的一种工作母机，在工业建设中用途较广。
    解放以前，上海机床厂只能制造锄头、耕犁等简单农具和修配一些机器零件。解放以来，已先后试制和生产了八种磨床和一种横镗床，其中有一九五四年制成的五种苏联式新型磨床。正在试制中的还有四种，一九五五年试制的将增加到十多种。试制速度由每年一种提高到每月一种。精密度的要求也越来越高。这些新产品，供应了并将继续供应全国各地包括鞍山钢铁公司、第一汽车制造厂、拖拉机制造厂等重工业建设单位。
    以推行作业计划的方法，组织生产秩序
    到一九五四年上半年为止，我们工厂的产品还是单一的、规格不多的。而且这些产品的规格又旧，不适合国家需要，所以成百台的机器被积压着。去年下半年，我们在上级的领导下，根据国家需要什么就生产什么的原则，勇敢地修改一九五四年原订计划，坚决削减原计划中不适合国家需要的老产品，增加国家需要的新产品——由二种增加到五种。
    产品增加了，车间里怎样合理地组织生产秩序，以保证新产品试制任务按时完成，老产品的生产能按时结束呢？
    我们先从整顿车间生产作业计划工作着手，学习兄弟工厂单个小批生产组织作业计划的经验。
    我们的作业计划基础是很差的：旧的劳动组织是按工艺特点划分的联合工段，零件加工不能在一个工段之内完成，跨车间跨工段的很多，质量责任扯不清，对在制品的流动控制不住，对零件的来去有时不点数，造成彼此的数字不对头。排计划的人也没有信心，认为编计划是“摆摆样子”，“做了再说”。这些落后的和不统一的做法，在试制新产品和组织多品种生产后，就行不通了。
    在上级派来的工作组的具体帮助下，我们首先分析机床的零件图纸，根据零件形状的特点成立了四个加工车间，包括九个专业化的工段。每一个专业化的工段负责加工一定类型的零件。装配车间则按产品对象为原则，组成四个专业工段，使每一个专业工段负责装配同一产品系列内所有型号的机床。调整后的劳动组织大大减少了跨工段、跨车间的加工零件和装配作业，把在制品的活动约束在一定的范围内。这样，责任非常明确，技术经验也更加容易积累起来，替编制作业计划创造了极为有利的条件，也使贯彻责任制具备了实际的工作内容。
      加工车间有几千几万件零件在流动着，要是计划安排得不好，就会出乱子。在这里，我们抓住两种作业计划，即月计划和昼夜班计划。编制月计划时，应着重保证各品种的零件出产指标符合装配的需要。昼夜班计划，可以调整因月计划预计不足而发生的变动。月计划有了昼夜班计划的调整，便不会“落空”，昼夜班计划有了月计划的引导，便不会“迷途”。车间工段两级领导通过作业计划掌握了多品种的生产。以计划组织生产，从而打破了初期对组织多品种生产的种种顾虑。在装配车间编的则是“系列产品装配交替计划表”，这个表指出各道装配工序需要零件的先后次序，把装配车间的需要和加工车间的供给组织起来了，防止了零件缺少或积压的现象。
    作业计划的编制必须根据各车间的生产特点，才能起组织生产的作用。同时，为了提高作业计划的经济效果，我们从去年第三季度开始，给车间下达了生产总量、废品亏损、劳动生产率、工具报损、人员工资定额、辅助物料消耗等六项技术经济指标，以便衡量作业计划的先进性，并作为劳动竞赛的目标。这些指标的制订要考虑到工时定额松紧程度，新旧产品比重大小，操作难易，工人技术水平高低，以及投料数量多少等因素，一般是工人必须经过努力才能完成的指标，才起了鼓励和提高工作的作用。指标下达后，又陆续建立了定期的检查制度，车间并建立了形象化的指示图表，公布每个工人完成指标的情况，使工人都能及时了解，并相互督促争取完成计划。
    从加强生产技术准备工作着手，扩大多品种生产
    由原来单一品种的成批生产转为多品种的单个小批生产后，原来的一套生产技术准备工作也显得跟不上了。我们便按试制任务，将各项技术准备工作有计划地都组织起来。生产技术准备工作的计划化也就是科室工作的计划化。因此，我们陆续调整了科室的组织，抽调人力加强技术部门。在设计科内设立了按产品系列分工的各种设计小组；另外成立生产服务组，负责解决新产品试制后进入小批和成批生产阶段中图样上存在的各种问题，做到发展品种和照顾当前生产两不误。在施工科，增设产品主要施工员，使每一种新产品的全部工艺有专人负责，以保证产品质量。在生产科，成立了生产准备计划组，全面掌握新产品试制中各项准备工作的进度。工具科的组织也作了相应的调整。我们还依照苏联专家建议，成立了标准化小组，在总工程师领导下，规划和执行全厂各项产品零件和工夹具零件标准化的工作，简化各项设计工作，提高经济效果。
    为了克服原来殖民地性机械工业修配时代所遗留下来的不正规习气，消除由于技术管理上没有完整的制度所引起的被动混乱和不协调现象，我们还建立了若干必要的工作制度。这些制度的建立，主要是为了明确责任，保证质量和压缩周期，要求各项生产前的准备工作做得又好又及时。在生产技术准备工作计划化的过程中，要掌握两点：第一，发挥科室的主动性。为此，规定了厂级掌握大项目，各科掌握细项目。第二，推行各种先进经验，以压缩准备工作的时间。如试制CK371型的平面磨床时，由于运用“平行交错”工作法，缩短周期三、四个月。又如实行了产品零部件设计的标准化和规格化后，现在已经有五种产品采用了统一的标准件。这些统一的标准件，技术部门只要设计一次，不必像过去那样每部新机床里的每一个零件都要设计，都要制订工艺规程，因而大大简化了工作，缩短了准备工作的时间，相对的也提高了工作的质量。在材料供应方面，也进行了规格化工作。
    依靠党的领导，发动群众克服困难
    试造新产品的时候，遇到不少困难问题，但每次我们都依靠党的领导，发动群众，结合采取的技术组织措施把困难克服了。我们修改一九五四年生产计划时，有的职工不了解增加新品种的意义，而只看到已经积压了的产品的数量减少了，所以认为修改计划跟社会主义工业化有矛盾，情绪不高。党组织便结合总路线的宣传，对职工说明改变计划的积极意义，说明增加了新产品，适当承接杂活，不积压国家资金，这就是具体地实现国家工业化的政策。开始为新产品进行生产技术准备工作时，大多数工程技术人员都很热情，但要求比过去搞老产品的准备时间加速一倍时，又怕技术力量薄弱应付不了。我们除了适当调整组织，合理分工外，还组织学习苏联的、先进地区的经验和上级指示，特别是厂部组织有关科长对每项工作的安排进行充分讨论和具体部署；结合专题会议，协助解决科室业务上的困难问题，大大提高了劳动效率。如设计科，过去设计一张零件图纸要十八、九小时，现在只要十一小时了；从去年下半年起，能够一个月做完一台新机床的全部图纸。
    组织多品种生产，对车间的领导干部也是个新的管理问题。车间主任都是从工人中提拔起来的，对具体的生产技术是熟练的，但是要管理几千个零件、几万个工序，有秩序地安排生产，却是件棘手的事。党组织的任务就是一方面帮助他们打破守旧观念，一方面提高他们的信心，要求他们虚心学习计划管理。标准件车间是加工车间之一，零件件数上千种，车间主任曾经因管理不住，心中无数而苦恼，并表示不愿做领导工作，但在该车间党支部的帮助和厂部派人协助推行作业计划后，他说：“车间在制品能够有百分之九十五掌握得住了。”
    工人们起初对试造新产品有三大顾虑：一不习惯，例如过去图纸符号都用英文字母，现在改用俄文字母，看不懂；二是苏联图纸标准要求严格，质量要求高，怕技术跟不上；三怕达不到定额，拿不到奖金。党组织和工会根据这些情况，配合行政，除了进行思想教育外，从积极方面组织职工学习苏联先进技术经验，组织了工程技术人员向工人介绍新机床的结构性能，讲解苏联技术标准，举办俄文字母学习班。由工会生产委员会组织老工人集体解决施工过程中难做的工作物。党的组织通过生产会议同工人、工程技术人员研究解决生产技术中的关键问题，开展订个人计划和劳动竞赛，保证完成和超额完成定额计划。这样便大大提高了工人的信心，并出现了许多先进工作方法。工会工作者张锡宝、袁张庆提出了自动退刀器、车螺丝的合理化建议；车工张裕金实行了金钢刀断层法；铣工李永顺实行了改进铣刀用金钢刀高速镗孔法；铸工陈凤林用了劈模造型法铸造大件，效率提高两倍；标准件车间与轴套车间的老工人集体研究出旋风切削螺丝法，以及铸工车间工人集体研究冷泵冲砂法等等。工人技术水平也不断地提高。在一九五四年十二月中旬召开的全厂职工大会上，奖励了四百多名优秀职工，其中有一百七十七个工人在十一月份提前完成了全年的生产定额，如铣工李永顺完成了一年零九个月又十二天的定额；劳动模范车工盛利完成了一年八个月又一天的定额。另外还有二百五十六个技术人员、办事员、辅助工和杂工也受到奖励。我们进行多品种的生产时间还短，获得的成绩还不巩固，今年试制新品种更多，任务更重，特别是我们还很缺乏科学的管理企业的知识，所以必须在现有的基础上进一步加强学习苏联社会主义企业管理的先进经验，加强计划性，提高制造技术水平，才能为社会主义工业化制造更多的新产品。（附图片）
