Xinhua News Agency, 3rd of January: U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Radford, concluded his activities in Taiwan on the 2nd and departed for South Korea.

While in Taiwan, Radford participated in meetings between Chiang Kai-shek and high-ranking U.S. military officers. The U.S. side attending the meetings included the Commander of Task Force 72 of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, Kiewitt, and the Chief of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group to Taiwan, Chase. During his three-day stay in Taiwan, Radford also held three secret talks with the Chiang bandit. As can be seen from Agence France-Presse reports, the content of the talks included expanding the direct U.S. military occupation of China's coastal islands and the issue of the U.S. equipping Chiang's bandits with weapons for another three divisions.

As early as December 23rd of last year, U.S. columnist Allen revealed that Radford's trip to Taiwan was to use the "rights" obtained by the United States through the U.S.-Chiang treaty to expand the threat of war against China. Allen said: "The primary task of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is to inspect possible locations for U.S. military bases on the strategically important island of Taiwan." Allen also revealed that Radford advocated for U.S. combat troops to directly occupy Taiwan.

Upon arriving in Taiwan, Radford advocated the establishment of a Northeast Asian aggressive military alliance including the Taiwan Chiang bandit, the South Korean Syngman Rhee group, and Japan. Following Radford's activities in Taiwan, International News Service reported that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles would follow with a "visit" to Taiwan in February "to study the possibility of organizing an economic and military alliance between free Asian nations." This shows that the U.S. is using the U.S.-Chiang treaty to expand its aggression and war deployments against China, which is an integral part of the U.S. conspiracy to invade the Far East and prepare for a new war.

    美国借美蒋条约扩大对我国的侵略活动
    雷德福在台湾活动后去南朝鲜，杜勒斯将在下月去台湾
    【新华社三日讯】美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福在二日结束了他在台湾的活动，前往南朝鲜。
    雷德福在台湾时参加了蒋介石和美国高级军官的会议。美国方面出席会议的有美国第七舰队第七十二特遣舰队司令基维特和美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团团长蔡斯。雷德福在逗留台湾的三天中，还和蒋贼举行了三次秘密会谈。从法新社消息中可以看出，会谈的内容包括扩大美国对中国沿海岛屿的直接军事占领和美国以武器装备蒋贼另外三个师的问题。
    早在去年十二月二十三日，美国专栏作家艾伦即透露，雷德福台湾之行是要利用美国借美蒋条约取得的“权利”来扩大对中国的战争威胁。艾伦说：“参谋长联席会议主席的首要任务就是要在具有战略意义的台湾岛上视察美国军事基地的可能的地点。”艾伦还透露，雷德福主张使美军战斗部队直接占据台湾。
    雷德福在抵达台湾时，曾鼓吹成立包括台湾蒋贼、南朝鲜李承晚集团和日本的东北亚侵略军事联盟。在雷德福在台湾活动后，国际新闻社消息传出，美国国务卿杜勒斯将跟着在二月间到台湾“访问”，“以研究组织亚洲自由国家间的经济和军事联盟的可能性”。这说明，美国借美蒋条约扩大对中国的侵略和战争部署，是美国侵略远东、准备新战争的整个阴谋的组成部分。
