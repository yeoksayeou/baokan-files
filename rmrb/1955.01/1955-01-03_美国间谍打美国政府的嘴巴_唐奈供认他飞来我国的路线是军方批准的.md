Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: American spy John Thomas Downey, sentenced to life imprisonment in China, confessed: his flight route to China was "approved by the U.S. 'Tokyo Far East Air Force Command and Korean Air Force Command.'"

Downey said: "My mission to fly to China on November 29, 1952, was to use a skyhook to retrieve an agent from the air (Editor's note: This person is the agent Li Junying, who has already been sentenced to life imprisonment)." He said that he was ordered by the head of the CIA's spy agency in Atsugi, Japan, to depart from Japan to Seoul on November 25 to undergo training in using the skyhook before carrying out the above activities.

Downey said: "Our flight route was a route commonly used by the Atsugi spy agency for flying to China, that is, flying roughly east from Seoul to the east coast, and then flying north at sea."

He said: According to the original plan, after retrieving the agent in the air, the plane would fly back to Seoul along the original route. "In case of an emergency, such as if the agent was injured or something else happened, the plane could land at a small air force airport near the east coast of Korea."

The plane took off from Seoul shortly after 9:00 PM. "The weather was clear and cold during the flight, and the visibility was very good. Shortly after takeoff, we saw flashes of artillery fire outside the window on the left." Downey said that his plane crossed the Sino-Korean border at midnight and reached the location for retrieving the agent fifteen minutes later. The plane was then shot down.

Downey continued: "This plane was a C-47 type plane belonging to the Atsugi spy agency, that is, belonging to the CIA. It had no markings and was 'sanitized' for security purposes to prevent its origin from being traced." Downey also said that the Atsugi spy agency had several C-47 and B-17 type planes.

Downey said that the agent he was trying to retrieve was a Chinese agent airdropped into Northeast China in October 1952. "The purpose of retrieving him was for him to report back on the results of his activities. He also had to bring back any documents, intelligence, etc., collected by the 'Wen Team' (a team of spies airdropped into China—Editor’s note)."

Downey said that he began working for the CIA in the United States in June 1951. He received 24 weeks of training in "secret operations and guerrilla warfare" and was sent to Japan in December of the same year. He was "responsible for training" a group of agents who were later airdropped into China.

Downey said: "The skyhook includes an electrically operated winch." He also said: "One end of a rope is tied to a turntable and then passes through a metal pulley mounted on an iron arm extending outside the aircraft door. The other end of the rope has a hook, which is hung on a pole extending from the outside of the aircraft. During flight, the aircraft tries to make this pole touch the ground agent's rope rack. At this time, the aircraft's rope is separated from the pole, and the hook hooks the ground agent's rope rack, so the winch starts to rotate and lifts the ground agent."

He said that Fecteau, who was on the same plane with him, served as the "winch operator" (Editor's note: This person is another CIA spy who was sentenced), while he himself was "operating the pole."

The skyhook that Downey mentioned is now on display at the "Exhibition of Evidence of American Airdropped Spies" at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace. This skyhook was seized from the downed plane that Downey and Fecteau were on.

Xinhua News Agency, 1st: According to Zhang Zaiwen, the leader of the American agent "Wen Team," and Luan Hengshan, the leader of the "Shen Team," in the case of American spy John Thomas Downey, John Thomas Downey was responsible for training agents and airdropping agents into China at the C-3 secret barracks set up by the CIA near Chigasaki, Japan.

In this barracks, Downey taught the agents courses on underground warfare and how to establish communication lines. Agent Luan Hengshan said: "Downey asked us to make hypothetical plans for gathering intelligence on the communication line of Andong-Shenyang-Sipingjie." Downey also taught a course on organizing escape networks. The main content of this course was how underground agents could rescue downed U.S. Air Force personnel and safely return through the escape network. Downey also asked the agents to base a story on the geographical features of a certain area on how to cover up. Agent Zhang Zaiwen said: "Downey commented on the cover stories we made."

Agent Luan Hengshan said: "Downey taught us how to defend ourselves with our bare hands. He said that he was an expert in self-defense with bare hands."

After the Chinese agents of the "Wen Team" were airdropped into Jilin Province, Downey personally flew a U.S. plane into China's Northeast airspace in August 1952 to airdrop two parachutes to the "Wen Team." Agent Zhang Zaiwen said:
"After Niu Songlin and I contacted the plane Downey was on using the navigation station, the plane circled twice and dropped the things. The dropped items included a radio, two submachine guns, bedding, medicine, and food, as well as five taels of gold and five gold rings." This time, Downey also airdropped many letters from the U.S. spy agency to the "Wen Team" agents, asking them to lie dormant for a long time.

### 美国间谍打美国政府的嘴巴  唐奈供认他飞来我国的路线是军方批准的

    美国间谍打美国政府的嘴巴
    唐奈供认他飞来我国的路线是军方批准的
    【新华社二日讯】被我国判处无期徒刑的美国籍间谍约翰·托马斯·唐奈供认：他飞到中国的路线是经过美国的“东京远东空军司令部和朝鲜空军司令部批准的”。
    唐奈说：“一九五二年十一月二十九日我飞往中国的任务是用空取器从空中去取回一名特务
  （编者按：此人即已被判处无期徒刑的特务李军英）”。他说：他是奉美国中央情报局驻日本厚木的间谍机构负责人的命令，在十一月二十五日从日本出发到汉城，以便在进行上述活动前进行使用空取器的训练。
    唐奈说：“我们飞行的路线是厚木间谍机关向中国飞行常用的一条路线，即从汉城大体上向东飞向东海岸，然后在海上往北飞。”
    他说：按照原定计划，在空中取回特务后，飞机即从原来的路线飞回汉城。“如果碰到紧急情况，即如果这个特务受伤或发生其他事情时，这架飞机可在靠近朝鲜东海岸的一个小型空军机场着陆。”
    这架飞机在下午九时后不久从汉城起飞。“飞行时气候清朗而寒冷，能见度很好。起飞不久，我们看到左面的窗外有炮火的闪光。”唐奈说：他的飞机在午夜十二时越过朝中边境，十五分钟后即到达空取特务的地点。这架飞机随后被击落。
    唐奈接着说：“这架飞机是属于厚木间谍机关的一架C—47型飞机，也就是属于中央情报局的。它没有任何标志，是经过‘消毒’的安全措施的，以便不致被查出它的来历。”唐奈又说，厚木间谍机关有几架C—47型和B—17型的飞机。
    唐奈说，他企图空取回去的那个特务是在一九五二年十月被空投在中国东北的。“把他取回的目的是要他回去报告关于他活动的结果。他还要带回‘文队’（空投到中国的一队间谍——编者）所搜集到的任何文件、情报等。”
    唐奈说，他从一九五一年六月起在美国开始为中央情报局工作。他受了二十四个星期的“秘密活动和游击战争”的训练，并在同年十二月被派往日本。他曾“负责训练”一批后来空降到中国的特务。
    唐奈说：“空取器包括一个电力操纵的绞盘”。他又说：“一条绳子的一端是扎在一个转盘上，然后通过一个安在伸出飞机门外的铁臂上的金属滑轮。绳子的另一端有一个钩子，挂在由飞机外伸的杆子上。飞机在飞行当中设法使这杆子碰到地面特务的绳架。这时，飞机的绳子就和杆子脱离，钩子就把地面特务的绳架钩住，于是绞盘开始旋转，把地面特务吊上来。”
    他说和他在同一架飞机上的有充当“绞盘手”的费克图（编者按：此人为另一名被判处的美国中央情报局的间谍分子），他自己则是“操纵杆子”的。
    唐奈说的这具空取器现在已陈列在北京劳动人民文化宫的“美国空降特务罪证展览会”上。这具空取器是从唐奈和费克图所乘的那架被击落的飞机上缴获的。
     【新华社一日讯】据美国间谍约翰·托马斯·唐奈案中的美国特务“文队”队长张载文和“沈队”队长栾衡山供称，约翰·托马斯·唐奈在美国中央情报局设在日本茅崎附近的C—3秘密营房里，担负训练特务和对中国进行空投特务的责任。
    唐奈在这个营房里，对特务教过地下作战如何建立交通线的课程。特务栾衡山说：“唐奈叫我们做过在安东—沈阳—四平街的交通线上刺探情报的假设计划。”唐奈还教过组织脱逃网的课程。这一课程主要内容是要地下特务如何救护被击落的美国空军人员经过脱逃网安全返回。唐奈还要特务以某
  一地区的地物情况为根据，编一个如何掩护的故事。特务张载文说：“唐奈对我们编的掩护故事都做过评论。”
    特务栾衡山说：“唐奈教过我们如何徒手自卫。他说，他是徒手自卫的能手。”
      “文队”中国籍特务空投到吉林省后，唐奈在一九五二年八月亲自乘美国飞机偷入我国东北领空，给“文队”空投下两个伞。特务张载文说：
  “我和牛松林用领航台和唐奈乘坐的飞机进行联络后，飞机绕了两个圈子就把东西投下来了。投下的东西里有电台一部、冲锋枪二支、被服、药品和食物等，还有黄金五两、金戒指五个。”这次唐奈还空投下许多封美国间谍机关给“文队”特务的信，要他们长期潜伏。
