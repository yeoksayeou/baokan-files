    "Underground Factory" on the Northeast Frontier
    ——Introduction to the Shuangyashan Lingxi Coal Mine Shaft
    Gao Jiandong
    On the banks of the Anbang River and at the foot of the Chuhanding Mountain in the northern foothills of the Wanda Mountains in the northeast frontier of our motherland, a modern underground factory, the Shuangyashan Lingxi Coal Mine Shaft, is about to be completed.

    Four years ago, the strongly cohesive coking coal formed in the depths of these mountains 15 million years ago was discovered by geological surveyors of New China. Based on the geological data already explored and referring to Soviet mine design standards and design principles, the young mine engineering designers designed these twin shafts. In mid-October 1952, the people building the shafts, filled with confidence, broke the first ground. After twenty-seven months of hard work, these modern shafts are nearing completion. Many automated mechanical devices are installed in the shafts. When male and female miners go to work, they take the automatic elevator cage in the auxiliary shaft and can reach the bottom of the well, more than 150 meters deep, in 30 seconds. After going down the well, the miners take electric trains, traveling along the concrete-paved transportation road illuminated by electric lights, to their work place or the coal face. They will operate coal cutters and the world's best coal mining machine - the Donbass-type combined coal mining machine for production. The dark and shiny coal blocks are planed off by the machine, automatically transferred from the chain conveyor at the coal face to the belt conveyor in the flat roadway, and then automatically loaded into mine cars. Then the storage motor takes the mine cars full of coal to the bottom of the well yard, and then through the tippler to the underground coal bunker. At this time, the skip of the main shaft descends, and the winch lifts the coal to the surface, which is transported by a belt corridor to the surface coal bunker. Trains are parked under the coal bunker, and the coal in the coal bunker is automatically loaded into the carriages, and then driven to all parts of the country.

    In this "underground factory," there are transportation roads as dense as spider webs; there are winch rooms, waiting rooms, powder magazines, water sumps, coal bunkers, pump rooms, central substations, and electric locomotive garages; there is also a traffic command room, using various transportation signals to allocate and direct the operation of underground vehicles. Communication telephones connect to various coal faces and workplaces, and the dispatcher grasps the entire situation of the underground factory through the telephone, directing every link of production.

    The safety and welfare facilities underground are also very complete. In addition to medical stations, canteens, and ventilation and drainage equipment, there are rock powder sheds to prevent gas explosions and water spraying equipment to eliminate coal dust. If a fire or flood occurs in the pit, the train in the fire prevention train depot will immediately go to the place where the fire occurred to extinguish the fire, and the miners can safely escape the danger of floods and fires by dropping the gates at the fire and water prevention safety doors. If there is a power outage or the main rope breaks, the cage in the wellbore will be stuck by the automatic safety clip and stop steadily there. These perfect facilities guarantee the safety of underground production and the health of the miners in all aspects.

    After the miners work hard for a day, they ascend to the surface, enter the administrative and welfare complex building, take off their work clothes, pick up the clothes they wear after work, and go to the warm and comfortable bathhouse to take a bath and change clothes. Then they go to the sun lamp to absorb ultraviolet rays, making up for the sunshine they did not enjoy for eight hours underground. If they do not want to go home immediately, they can eat in the canteen of the administrative and welfare complex building, play in the club, or rest in the garden with fresh air and beautiful scenery on the south side of the factory.

    After these huge shafts are put into production, its annual output will be equivalent to the total output of the seven inclined shafts of the Shuangyashan Lingxi Coal Mine now, which is more than 200% of the annual output of the Shuangyashan Coal Mine in 1949. The quality of the coal it produces is very good. It can not only be refined into high-quality coke to supply the country's iron and steel industry, but also can be chemically processed to produce synthetic rubber, synthetic fibers, engine oil, and various pharmaceutical agents such as aspirin and hormones, as well as various perfumes, fuels, and other industrial raw materials.

    Now, the people building the shafts at Shuangyashan Lingxi are working hard to transfer the shafts to production as soon as possible. They are busy cleaning the work sites above and below ground, installing machines, and test running. Soon, the combine will be put into the well, and dark and shiny coal blocks will continuously pour out from the ground, be loaded onto trains, and transported to various industrial cities.

    东北边疆上的“地下工厂”
    ——双鸭山岭西煤矿竖井介绍
    高建东
    在祖国东北边疆的安邦河畔和完达山脉北麓出汗岭的山脚下面，一座近代化的地下工厂——双鸭山岭西煤矿竖井，即将建成了。
    一千五百万年以前在这山地底层形成的有强烈粘结力的炼焦煤，在四年前被新中国的地质勘测人员发现了。年轻的矿井工程设计人员根据已经探讨出来的地质资料，参照苏联矿井设计标准和设计原理，设计了这对竖井。一九五二年十月中旬，建设竖井的人们充满信心地，挖下了第一锹。经过二十七个月的辛勤劳动，现在，这对近代化的竖井就快要建成了。竖井里安装着很多自动化的机械装置。男女矿工们上班的时候，到副井乘上自动升降机操纵着的罐笼，三十秒钟就可以到达一百五十多公尺深的井底。下井后，矿工们乘坐着电车，沿着混凝土砌的，被电灯照得通明的运输道，走向自己接班的工作场所或掌子面。他们将操纵着截煤机和世界上最好的采煤机器——顿巴斯型联合采煤机进行生产。乌黑晶亮的煤块被机器刨下来，自动地从掌子面的链板运输机上移到平巷的皮带运输机上，然后又自动装入矿车里。接着蓄电机便带着一辆一辆装满煤块的矿车，送到井底车场，又经过翻笼送到井下煤仓。这时主井的箕斗降下来，用绞车把煤提到井上，由皮带走廊运送到井上煤仓。煤仓下面停放着火车，煤仓里的煤自动装入车厢，就驶往全国各地去了。
    在这座“地下工厂”里，有密如蛛网的运输道；有绞车室、等候室、火药库、水仓、煤仓，水泵房、中央变电所、电机车库；还有行车指挥室，用各种运输信号，调配和指挥井下车辆运行。通讯电话通向各个掌子面和工作场所，调度员通过电话掌握着地下工厂的全部情况，指挥着每一个环节进行生产。
    井下的安全福利设施也很完善。除了有医疗所、食堂、通风排水设备外，还有防止瓦斯爆发的岩粉棚子和消灭煤尘的撒水设备。如果坑内一旦发生火灾或水灾，防火列车库的列车马上就出动到发火的地方灭火，矿工们到防火、防水的安全门里把闸门一落，就可以平安地脱出水灾和火灾的危险。如果遇到停电或大绳中断，井筒的罐笼就会被自动保险卡子卡住，稳稳地停在那里。这些完美的设施从各方面保障着井下生产的安全和矿工们的身体健康。
    矿工们辛勤劳动一天之后，升到井上来，走进行政福利联合大楼，脱下工作服，拿起下工穿的衣服，走到温暖舒适的浴池里去洗澡更衣，接着又到太阳灯下吸收紫外线，弥补在井下八小时没有享受到的阳光。如果不愿意马上回家，可以在行政福利联合大楼的食堂里吃饭，到俱乐部里玩玩，或者到工厂南侧空气清新风景幽美的花园里休息休息。
    这对巨大的竖井投入生产后，它的年产量相当于现在双鸭山岭西煤矿七个斜井产量的总和，相当于双鸭山煤矿一九四九年全矿年产量的百分之二百以上。它出产的煤质非常优良，不仅可以炼成优质焦炭，供给祖国的钢铁工业生产，而且可以通过化学加工，制造出人造橡胶、人造纤维、发动机用油和阿斯匹林、荷尔蒙等各种药剂，制造各种香料、燃料等工业原料。
    现在双鸭山岭西建设竖井的人们正在为争取竖井尽快移交生产而紧张地工作着，他们忙着在井上井下清理工作现场，忙着安装机器和试运转。不久之后，康拜因就要放到井下去，乌黑发亮的煤块就将从地下不断地涌出来，被火车装运到各个工业城市去。（附图片）
    这是一个高大副井井架，井架的天车不停的往井下运输着建设竖井所需的一切材料和机器，竖井完工投入生产以后，还要继续靠它运送材料。
