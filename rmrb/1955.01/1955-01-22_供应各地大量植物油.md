Supplying Large Quantities of Vegetable Oil to Various Regions

Sichuan Province, a major producer of vegetable oils, transferred over 30,000 tons of vegetable oil to other provinces in 1954, exceeding its outward transfer plan. Of this, over 13,000 tons were supplied for export. The amount of edible vegetable oil transferred to Shanghai last year increased ninefold compared to the previous year, playing a significant role in meeting the needs of the people of Shanghai. Last year, Sichuan Province also transferred 450,000 jin of peanuts to disaster areas in Hunan, Hubei, and other regions, strongly supporting disaster relief and production work in these areas.

In 1954, the sown area of major oilseed crops such as rapeseed, peanuts, and sesame in Sichuan Province increased by more than 1.6 million mu compared to 1953, with an average increase of 3 jin per mu in yield per unit area, and a total output increase of 26.8 percent. Oil processing workers in many areas actively improved production techniques, increasing oil extraction rates. In Xindu County, using traditional presses to extract rapeseed, the oil yield was 43.5 jin per 100 jin of rapeseed, an average increase of 3 jin compared to the previous year; in Suining County, the oil extraction rate for cottonseed reached a maximum of 17 percent; in Nanchong City, a maximum of 52.5 jin of oil could be extracted from 100 jin of peanuts. These are all quite high records nationwide. Currently, various regions are exploring ways to increase oil production from multiple oilseed crops and improve oil extraction techniques, striving to supply the needs of various regions with more oil in 1955.

    供应各地大量植物油
    盛产植物油脂的四川省，在一九五四年内调往省外三万多吨植物油，超额完成了外调计划。其中供应出口的有一万三千多吨。去年调给上海的食用植物油比前年增加了九倍，对供应上海人民的需要起了不小作用。四川省去年还调给湖南、湖北等地灾区四十五万斤花生仁，有力地支持了灾区的生产救灾工作。
    一九五四年四川省油菜、花生、芝麻等主要油料作物的播种面积，比一九五三年扩大了一百六十多万亩，单位面积产量每亩平均提高三斤，总产量增加了百分之二十六点八。许多地区的油脂加工工人积极改进生产技术，提高了产油率。新都县用土榨榨菜籽，每百斤产油四十三斤半，比前年平均提高三斤；遂宁县棉籽产油率最高达百分之十七；南充市每百斤花生仁最多可产油五十二点五斤。这在全国都是相当高的纪录。现在，各地正从多种油料作物、提高榨油技术等方面设法增加油脂产量，争取在一九五五年内以更多的油脂供应各地的需要。
