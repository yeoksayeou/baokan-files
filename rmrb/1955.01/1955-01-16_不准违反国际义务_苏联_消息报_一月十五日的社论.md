    No Violation of International Obligations
    ——Soviet "Izvestia" Editorial on January 15th

    Millions of people in European countries who are concerned about the fate of peace have now become increasingly aware that the Paris Agreements have exacerbated international tensions and created a situation in Europe filled with the threat of new military conflicts. The aggressive bloc of the United States and its partners are striving to confront the people of Europe with a fait accompli: the rearmament of West Germany and its inclusion in the militarist alliances of the "Western European Union" and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

    The initiators of the Paris Agreements are preparing to write off international treaties and obligations in order to push forward their aggressive plans. The danger of the Paris Agreements is heightened by the fact that the agreements stipulate that the participating countries of the Western European military alliance will prepare for chemical and bacteriological warfare, stockpile chemical and bacteriological weapons, and equip their armies with these weapons. They will hand over these barbaric weapons, along with atomic weapons, to West German militarists and revanchists.

    This situation can only increase the danger of a devastating chemical and bacteriological war in Europe. The Soviet government believes it has a responsibility to warn the governments of Western countries about this. In its notes to the governments of the six countries of Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg on January 13, the Soviet government emphasized that the Paris Agreements contain clauses that violate the Geneva Protocol of June 17, 1925, "Concerning the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare."

    The Geneva Protocol, signed thirty years ago, reflected the determination of all nations to prevent the use of devastating weapons such as asphyxiating and poisonous gases and other chemical weapons, which were widely used in the First World War and condemned by the entire civilized world. The Geneva Protocol also expressed the determination to forever eliminate the danger of using harmful bacteriological weapons intended to infect humanity with major diseases.

    The states that signed this protocol, "to the end that this prohibition shall be universally accepted as a part of international law, binding alike the conscience and the practice of nations," undertook the following obligations: they "declare their acceptance of this prohibition, agree to extend this prohibition to the use of bacteriological methods of warfare and agree to be bound as between themselves according to the terms of this declaration."

    Now, the provisions of the Geneva Protocol have been recognized as a principle of international law by fifty countries, including all members of the "Western European Union": France, Britain, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and West Germany.

    It is known that the Geneva Protocol played a significant role in preventing the use of chemical and bacteriological weapons in the Second World War. Even the Nazi leaders did not dare to use these weapons.

    The use of chemical, bacteriological, and atomic weapons is contrary to the conscience and honor of all nations. Those aggressors who rely on these weapons and are prepared to deliberately use them want to commit heinous crimes against humanity.

    As can be seen from several protocols of the Paris Agreements, their initiators are attempting to stockpile chemical and bacteriological weapons in addition to stockpiling atomic weapons – a position the Soviet government has already stated in its notes on this issue. Disregarding the provisions of the Geneva Protocol, the participants in the Paris Agreements are preparing to use, as one of their signed documents emphasizes, asphyxiating, poisonous, irritant, paralytic, growth-inhibiting, vesicant, and catalytic chemical agents for military purposes. They not only stockpile chemical and bacteriological weapons, but also intend to expand these stockpiles, as the protocol of the Paris Agreements states, according to the strength of the armed forces of the countries participating in the "Western European Union," through large-scale manufacturing of such weapons on their own territory, as well as through purchasing them from another country and so-called "military assistance from another country."

    According to foreign press reports, the United States and certain other countries that follow the United States' aggressive policies have long been conducting research into deadly chemical and bacteriological weapons. The US military authorities are now even bringing former Nazi chemical and bacteriological warfare experts from West Germany to the United States. These facts show that the advocates of the Paris Agreements will stop at nothing to intensify preparations for chemical and bacteriological warfare. Progressive humanity cannot but feel great indignation at the sight of aggressive forces wanting to repeat on a larger scale the practice of using weapons of mass destruction, which was condemned by the people of all countries during the First World War.

    Out of concern for the interests of all countries, large and small, the Soviet government raised the important issue of the grave responsibility that France and other members of the "Western European Union" will bear for violating the Geneva Protocol in its January 13th notes. The note stated that the Soviet government "believes that the French government must be reminded that the obligations that France is preparing to assume under the Paris Agreements, which provide for the use of chemical and bacteriological weapons by the armed forces of the members of the 'Western European Union' and the members of the North Atlantic bloc, are incompatible with the international obligations that France has assumed under the Geneva Protocol of June 17, 1925, 'Concerning the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare.'"

    The Soviet Government's January 13th note has caused unease in the camp of those who, disregarding international obligations, are preparing to implement the Paris Agreements. Newspapers reflecting the opinions of aggressive elements are doing everything possible to weaken the impact of the Soviet note. Some Western newspapers hurriedly said that they considered the Soviet note to be "unclear." However, this excuse of Western propagandists cannot help them hide from the broad public the fact that the Soviet government's note exposed the truth about the Paris Agreements and thoroughly exposed its aggressive nature. It is significant that no Western bourgeois newspaper dared to refute the facts presented in the Soviet note, or assert that the Paris Agreements comply with the Geneva Protocol. The Soviet people and peace-loving people all over the world welcome the Soviet government's January 13th note. The people believe that this action by the Soviet government once again demonstrates its unyielding will to safeguard the cause of peace in Europe and throughout the world.

### 不准违反国际义务——苏联“消息报”一月十五日的社论

    不准违反国际义务
    ——苏联“消息报”一月十五日的社论
    千百万担心和平命运的欧洲国家人民现在已经越来越明白：巴黎协定加剧了国际紧张局势，并且在欧洲造成了一种充满着发生新的军事冲突的威胁的局面。美国的侵略集团和它的伙伴们正竭力使欧洲人民面临这样一个既成事实：重新武装西德，并且让西德加入军国主义的联盟——“西欧联盟”和北大西洋公约组织。
    巴黎协定的发起人正在准备勾销国际条约和义务，以推行他们的侵略计划。巴黎协定的危险已经由于这样一个事实而加甚：协定规定，西欧军事联盟的参加国将进行化学战争和细菌战争的准备，储存化学武器和细菌武器，用这些武器来装备自己的军队。他们将把这些野蛮的武器连同原子武器一起交给西德军国主义分子和复仇主义者。
    这种情况只能加甚在欧洲发生毁灭性的化学战争和细菌战争的危险。苏联政府认为它有责任向西方国家政府提出这种警告。苏联政府在一月十三日致英国、法国、意大利、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡六国政府的照会中强调指出：巴黎协定中含有同一九二五年六月十七日签订的“关于在战争中禁用窒息性、有毒的或其他瓦斯以及细菌武器”的日内瓦议定书相违背的条款。
    三十年前签订的日内瓦议定书反映了各国人民这样的决心：防止使用在第一次世界大战中广泛使用过的、受到了整个文明世界谴责的诸如窒息性和有毒的瓦斯以及其他化学武器之类的毁灭性武器。日内瓦议定书还表示决心，要永远消除使用那种目的在于使人类感染重大疾病的有害的细菌武器的危险。
    签订这个议定书的各国“为了要使各国在良心上和实践上受约束，从而公认这种禁止是国际法的一部分”，特承担下列义务：它们“承认这种禁止，同意把这种禁止扩大到细菌作战方法上，并同意彼此之间受这一宣言条款的约束”。
    现在，日内瓦议定书的规定已经被五十个国家公认为国际法的准则，其中包括全体“西欧联盟”成员国：法、英、意、比、荷、卢、西德。
    大家知道，日内瓦议定书在阻止在第二次世界大战中使用化学和细菌武器方面起过重大的作用。甚至纳粹的领袖们都没有敢使用这些武器。
    使用化学、细菌和原子武器是同各国的良心和荣誉相违背的。那些依靠这些武器并且准备故意使用它们的侵略分子想要对人类犯下滔天的罪行。
    由巴黎协定的若干议定书可以看出：它们的发起人企图除了储备原子武器——苏联政府在就这个问题提出的照会中已经表明了它的态度——以外，还想储备化学武器和细菌武器。巴黎协定的参加国不顾日内瓦议定书上的规定，准备使用，如它们所签订的文件之一所强调的，用于军事目的的窒息性、中毒性、刺激性、麻痹性、阻碍发育的、糜烂性和催化性的化学药剂。它们不仅储备化学和细菌武器，而且还企图像巴黎协定的议定书所说的那样，按照参加“西欧联盟”各国的武装部队的实力，通过在本国的领土上大规模制造这种武器，以及通过向另一国购买和所谓“另一国的军事援助”等办法来扩充这种储备。
    根据外国报纸消息，长期以来，美国和追随美国侵略政策的某些其他国家，一直在进行杀人的化学武器和细菌武器的研究工作。美国军事当局现在甚至把前纳粹化学及细菌战专家从西德带到了美国。这些事实表明，巴黎协定的鼓吹者们为了加紧准备化学及细菌战争是不择手段的。眼看着侵略势力要把在第一次世界大战期间遭到各国人民谴责的使用大规模毁灭性武器的作法在更大的规模上重演一遍，进步人类不能不感到莫大的愤慨。
    苏联政府由于关怀一切大小国家的利益，在一月十三日的照会中，提出了要由法国和其他“西欧联盟”成员国承担破坏日内瓦议定书的严重责任的这一重要问题。这个照会说，苏联政府“认为，必须提醒法国政府注意：法国根据规定关于‘西欧联盟’成员国和北大西洋集团成员国的军队可以使用化学武器和细菌武器的巴黎协定而准备承担的义务是和法国根据一九二五年六月十七日签订的‘关于在战争中禁用窒息性、有毒的或其他瓦斯以及细菌武器’的日内瓦议定书所承担的国际义务不相容的。”
    苏联政府一月十三日的照会在那些不顾国际义务、正准备执行巴黎协定的人们的阵营中引起了不安。反映侵略分子的意见的报纸无所不用其极地来削弱苏联照会所引起的影响。一些西方报纸仓惶地说，他们认为苏联照会“不清楚”。不过，西方宣传家的这种遁词并不能帮助他们在广大公众面前隐瞒这样一个事实：苏联政府的照会揭发了巴黎协定的真相，彻底揭露了它的侵略性质。没有一家西方资产阶级报纸敢于反驳苏联照会中提出的事实，或者断言巴黎协定符合日内瓦议定书，这件事是意味深长的。苏联人民和全世界和平爱好者都欢迎苏联政府一月十三日的照会。人民认为苏联政府这一行动再次说明它具有维护欧洲和全世界和平事业的不屈不挠的意志。
