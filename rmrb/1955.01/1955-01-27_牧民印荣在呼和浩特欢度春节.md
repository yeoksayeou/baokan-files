    Herdsman Yin Rong Spends the Spring Festival in Hohhot
    Ayou Wang Wen
    The Spring Festival brings joy to the blue city – Hohhot. Happy crowds throng the streets. Many institutions have erected colorful archways with ethnic patterns in front of their gates, and shops and residents have posted New Year couplets written in both Mongolian and Chinese.
    Yin Rong is a herdsman from the West Sunite Banner on the Xilin Gol Prairie. His wife, Namusilema, has been ill for many years. After the Jier Line was opened to traffic, they took the train to Hohhot for the first time for treatment. Twenty-odd days is not a long time, but thanks to the enthusiastic diagnosis and treatment by the doctors of the People's Hospital, Namusilema's condition has been basically cured.
    On the morning of the Spring Festival, Yin Rong accepted the invitation of Sun Liang, a national model worker in the textile industry and a worker at the local state-owned Hohhot Woolen Mill, to visit his home. Sun Liang received his guest with delicious pastries and sweet oranges. A few days ago, Yin Rong visited the woolen mill. Although this was only their second meeting, they talked to each other like familiar old friends. Sun Liang said: "We will not waste a single piece of wool. We will produce high-quality, low-cost, and novel-style woolen cloth, blankets, and sweaters to meet the growing material needs of the people." Yin Rong also said: "Under the leadership of the Party and the government, we will work hard to improve animal husbandry production and sell more good wool to the state to support the socialist construction of the motherland." Sun Liang turned on the radio awarded to him by the Ministry of Textile Industry and enjoyed a piece of music with his guest. Finally, the two exchanged gifts.
    After the friendly visit, Yin Rong went to the bustling and lively places in the city to play, and he watched the festive scenes with curious eyes wherever he went. When night fell, the crowds flowed to cinemas and theaters. At the hospitable Ulanqab Theater (Red Theater), Yin Rong was enjoying the performance of the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe from the heart of the motherland – Beijing. Yin Rong has watched the acrobatic troupe's performance twice. He was attracted by the excellent culture and art of the motherland, and whenever he mentioned the acrobatic troupe, he was so happy that his heart could not be calm for a long time.

    牧民印荣在呼和浩特欢度春节
    阿优  王温
    春节给蓝色的城——呼和浩特带来欢欣。街头上欢乐的人群来往不绝，许多机关门前搭起了带有民族形式花纹的彩楼，商店和居民的门前都贴出了用蒙汉两种文字写成的新春对联。
    印荣是锡林郭勒草原上西苏尼特旗的一个牧民，他的妻子娜木斯来玛患病多年，集二线通车后，他们第一次乘上火车，来呼和浩特治病。二十几天的时间并不算长，但是由于人民医院的大夫们的热心诊疗，现在娜木斯来玛的病症已经基本治愈。
    春节的早晨，印荣接受全国纺织劳动模范、地方国营呼和浩特毛织厂工人孙良的邀请，到他家作客。孙良拿出可口的糕点、甘美的橘子接待着自己的客人。前几天，印荣参观了毛织厂，今天虽然才是第二次会面，但他们像熟悉的老朋友一样，彼此畅谈着知心话。孙良说：“我们不浪费一根羊毛，我们要做出质量好、成本低、样式新鲜的毛呢、毛毯和毛衣，来满足人民日益增长的物质生活的需要。”印荣也说：“我们要在党和政府的领导下，努力搞好牧业生产，把更多的好羊毛卖给国家，支援祖国社会主义建设。”孙良拧开中央纺织工业部奖给他的收音机，和客人共同欣赏了一阵音乐，最后两人又互赠了礼品。
    友谊的访问结束之后，印荣到市内繁华和热闹的地方游玩，每到一地，他以好奇的眼光注视着节日的景象。当夜幕笼罩大地的时候，人群流向电影院、剧院。在好客的乌兰恰特（红色剧院），印荣在欣赏着来自祖国心脏——北京的中国杂技团的表演。印荣已经两次观看了杂技团的表演，他被祖国优秀的文化艺术所吸引，每当一提到杂技团的时候，高兴得内心里久久不能平静。
