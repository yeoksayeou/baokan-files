    我国文化代表团在加尔各答受到热烈欢迎
    【新华社加尔各答十四日电】中国文化代表团在印度最大城市加尔各答的访问受到当地人民的热烈欢迎。代表团从九日到十二日接连举行了四次演出，丰富多采的中国京剧、舞蹈、音乐节目受到观众普遍的赞扬。
    中国驻加尔各答总领事柳雨峰为中国文化代表团的到来在七日下午举行了招待会。许多曾经访问过中国的印度人士穿上中国服装，带着妻子儿女来会见代表团。他们和代表团团员愉快地交谈中印文化交流问题和互相访问的感想。
    曾在一九五三年七月访问过中国的印度艺术代表团团长、西孟加拉省著名戏剧家萨钦·森古普塔和中国文化代表团团长郑振铎见面时紧紧地握着手说：“我们终于把你们盼来了！”一九二四年和泰戈尔一同到过中国的老教授卡利达斯·纳格为中国人民的伟大胜利和中印两国人民的友谊而祝贺。
    印中友好协会西孟加拉省分会在八日下午举行大会欢迎中国文化代表团。
    西孟加拉省艺术家协会十一日在朗格马哈尔剧场按照印度民族的传统习惯举行了隆重的欢迎仪式，并且演出了孟加拉话剧，欢迎中国文化代表团。当以郑振铎为首的中国文化代表团人员走入剧场时，全场响起了一片法螺声和欢呼声。印度妇女们端着一盏盏的灯火，给每个中国来宾在前额上点上吉祥痣，把檀香、香水和花瓣撒在代表团人员的身上。
    中国文化代表团还观看了加尔各答电影戏剧工作者和广播电台文化艺术工作者演出的孟加拉民间音乐舞蹈节目。他们在十三日下午欣赏了印度著名舞蹈家乌达伊·山卡尔领导的剧团的影子戏。
