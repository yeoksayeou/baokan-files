Xinhua News Agency, January 15th: According to TASS, construction of major hydroelectric power stations in the Soviet Union continues apace despite the severe cold.

At the construction site of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station, ice and snow have not been able to slow down the high-speed progress of the project for even a minute. Since the beginning of the new year, construction on both banks of the Volga River has been progressing faster and faster. In the first few days of the new year, thousands of cubic meters of concrete have already been poured in the foundation pits. The power plant building at the foot of Mount Mogutov is being built rapidly. Assemblers are especially busy, and before the dam is completed, they must install more than 20,000 tons of metal frames and equipment.

Construction of the Gorky Hydroelectric Power Station on the Volga River is also proceeding day and night. At the construction site of the power station building, important work such as building piers and installing stator iron columns is underway. The foundation, which is three stories high below the generators, has already begun to be installed. Many installers have proposed using pre-assembled reinforced concrete frames for installation, greatly accelerating the progress of reinforced concrete structure construction.

The severe cold has frozen the wharves of Stalingrad, but it cannot freeze the construction of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station. The entire construction and installation work plan for 1954 was completed about a month ahead of schedule. The dredger workers, who are building the main equipment of the hydroelectric power station, excavated more than 2 million cubic meters of mud beyond the plan by the end of last year, and are now implementing the work tasks for March of this year. Large-scale auxiliary enterprises, such as concrete mixing plants and steel bar factories, have been built near the construction site.

At the Irkutsk Hydroelectric Power Station on the Angara River, construction workers have adopted many new methods to ensure the uninterrupted progress of complex construction projects under cold weather conditions. Since the beginning of the new year, construction workers have begun building power plants and sluice gates. Huge boilers provide steam to the construction site to continue concrete pouring at low temperatures. This year's work plan is twice as large as last year's. In 1956, the first turbine of this huge hydroelectric power station will begin to generate electricity.

    苏联各大水电站工程冒寒前进
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社消息：在严寒的天气里，苏联各大水电站的建筑工程照样在热火朝天地进行着。
    在古比雪夫水电站的工地上，冰雪连一分钟也没有能够减低工程的高速度进展。新年开始以来，伏尔加河两岸工地上的工程进行得愈来愈快了。在新年的头几天中，基坑里已经浇灌了几千公方的混凝土。摩古托夫山脚下的发电厂厂房正在迅速地建筑起来。装配工人特别忙碌，在拦河坝筑好以前，他们要安装两万多吨金属架和设备。
    伏尔加河上的高尔基水电站的建筑工程昼夜不停地也在进行着。在水电站厂房的工地上，正在进行着砌墩和安装固定子铁柱等重要工作。发电机下面有三层楼那么高的基础工程，已经在开始安装。许多安装工人创议用预先装配好的钢筋构架进行安装工作，大大加快了钢筋结构工程的进展。
    严寒封冻了斯大林格勒的码头，但是却封冻不了斯大林格勒水电站的工程。一九五四年全年建设工程和装配工作计划约提前一个月完成，建设水电站主要设备的吸泥机工人在去年年底，超计划挖掘了二百多万公方的泥土，现在已经在执行今年三月份的工作任务了。大规模的辅助企业，如混凝土搅拌厂、扎钢筋工厂等已经在工地附近建造起来。
    在安加拉河畔的伊尔库次克水电站，建筑工人采用了许多新的方法，保证在寒冷的气候条件下，不间断地进行复杂的建设工程。新年开始以来，建筑工人已经开始建设发电厂和水闸。巨大的汽锅用蒸汽供给工地，以便在低温下继续进行混凝土的浇灌工作。今年的工作计划要比去年的计划大一倍。一九五六年，这个巨大的水电站的第一台水轮机就要开始发电。
