Why Do State-Owned Coal Mines Overspend on Pit Props Every Year?
Xiao Can

For several years, the waste of pit props in state-owned coal mines has been very serious. In 1953, Kailuan Coal Mine overspent on pit props by more than 44,100 cubic meters, worth 28.69 billion yuan. The Ministry of Fuel Industry and the Coal Mine Management Bureau were fully aware of this situation and had repeatedly criticized their subordinates, but the situation did not improve much in 1954. According to statistics from the Ministry of Fuel Industry, as of August 1954, state-owned coal mines across the country had overspent on pit props by more than 51,000 cubic meters, worth more than 30 billion yuan. Among them, Kailuan Coal Mine overspent by 18,000 cubic meters from January to October 1954, worth 11.8 billion yuan. The most serious thing is that this serious waste has not yet attracted the widespread attention of leading cadres in state-owned coal mines, and many coal mines still allow this phenomenon to exist for a long time without the determination to change this backward situation.

When the inspection team of the Ministry of Fuel Industry inspected the waste of timber in the Benxi Mining Bureau, they discovered a strange timber market in the mining area. The composition of this "market" was not ordinary timber merchants, but nearby residents. They were not dealing in batches of complete timber, but a large number of broken pieces of wood that had been sawn off. The market's inventory was quite sufficient, and the transactions were quite active. According to the inspection team's investigation, the wood stored in just six residential areas could load 25 train cars. This timber market was the direct product of the massive waste of pit props by the Benxi Mining Bureau.

The several coal mines under the Benxi Mining Bureau generally do not cherish timber when using pit props, using large timber for small purposes, and discarding the sawn-off wood at will. Nearby residents then collected these discarded timbers, accumulating more and more. Some people who needed sporadic timber would come to buy it from them, and some people used this as a way to make money, which eventually developed into such a strange "market."

The use of large timber for small purposes and long timber for short purposes, resulting in serious waste of timber, also exists in other large state-owned coal mines. For example, in the 7621 coal mining face of Kailuan Tangshan Coal Mine, the mining height is only three and a half feet, but they always take pit props that are four and a half feet, five feet, or even six feet long. If they are not suitable, they saw them off. On average, they saw off about 210 pieces of wood every day, losing more than three cubic meters.

Timber waste is also manifested in the fact that many coal mines do not take their timber management work seriously, and the system of receiving and returning materials is not strict. In some mines, workers can go to the timber yard to take pit props at will without any formalities; in other mines, they only receive materials and do not return them, resulting in a confused account. The Ministry of Fuel Industry once inspected 26 timber yards and found that the materials of 16 units did not match the cards. Before May 1954, Kailuan Coal Mine was one of the most chaotic units in pit prop management. The work system was unsound, the phenomenon of no one being responsible was prevalent, and a large number of pit props were accumulated in various mining areas for a long time, but no one checked or asked about them. Some coal mining faces had already ended, but the materials department still shipped pit props underground as usual. The height of some coal mining working faces had been changed from eight feet to five feet, but pit props were still sent in continuously according to the eight-foot standard, and the underground workers would saw them shorter and then use them.

Many coal mines do not pay attention to the recovery of pit props, and the recovery and reuse rate is very low. The pit prop recovery rate of the 218 working face of Wangfeng Mine, Jiaozuo Mining Bureau, only reached 10% to 12% in July and August 1954. Some coal mining faces only focus on moving forward and do not retract the props in time, resulting in too long a distance between the empty roof, excessive roof pressure, which leads to a high rate of pit prop breakage and difficulty in recovery. Sometimes it also often causes accidents that cut off the working face, causing all the pit props to be pressed into the old goaf. A coal mining face in Linxi Coal Mine once had a roof collapse accident for this reason, losing 1,300 pit props. There are also some coal mining faces that do not recover pit props when releasing the roof, arbitrarily abandoning a large number of pit props in the old goaf.

The overspending of pit props in coal mines is not insurmountable. For example, Jingjing Mining Bureau used to overspend on pit props frequently. Last October, they strengthened management and strictly controlled the consumption of pit props, which reversed the situation of overspending on pit props. The "July 1st" mining area of Tangshan Coal Mine overspent on pit props by 988 cubic meters in the first quarter of last year, accounting for 52% of the total overspending of the entire mine. In April, they learned from the experience of the three-level responsibility system for pit prop management of Beipiao Mining Bureau, formulated pit prop management methods, and resolutely implemented them. As a result, the situation in April changed greatly: not only was there no overspending, but also 129 cubic meters of timber were saved.

The above examples show that the serious overspending of pit props in coal mines is mainly due to poor management of pit props and the lack of a concept of cherishing state property among relevant personnel. Of course, there are also some other reasons, such as the poor organization of coal mine production management, abnormal production, geological surveying and design cannot correctly guide production, and the wage system is not reasonable enough. Sometimes, the pit props supplied by the forestry department are not up to standard, and waste is inevitable when used. The forestry department undoubtedly bears responsibility in this regard.

Coal mines are one of the departments that consume the most timber. It is estimated that an average of two tons of coal produced requires one round pit prop seven inches long. A coal mine with an annual output of two million tons consumes millions of round pit props every year. And how much manpower and material resources does it take to harvest, process, and transport these timbers from the place of origin to the mine. The overspending of pit props in coal mines not only causes a large loss of timber—an indispensable important material in basic construction—and waste of national transportation power, but also directly raises the cost of coal (pit props generally account for about 20% of the cost of coal), causing losses to the vast number of consumers.

For the needs of national construction, people have reason to ask the administrative management departments of state-owned coal mines and the leaders of state-owned coal mine enterprises in various places to pay attention to this serious waste when celebrating the completion of the 1954 annual output and total output value plan, and not let it be hidden under these figures for a long time, falling behind the national plan every year.

    国营煤矿的坑木为什么年年超支
    萧灿
    几年来，国营煤矿浪费坑木的情况一直很严重。一九五三年，开滦煤矿就超支了坑木四万四千一百多立方公尺，价值二百八十六亿九千余万元。燃料工业部和煤矿管理总局是完全知道这个情况的，也曾经对下边不断批评过，但一九五四年情况仍没有多大好转。据燃料工业部的统计，到一九五四年八月份为止，全国国营煤矿超支坑木五万一千多立方公尺，价值三百多亿元。其中开滦煤矿一九五四年一至十月份，就超支了一万八千立方公尺，价值一百十八亿元。而最严重的是：这种严重浪费的事实，至今还没有引起国营煤矿领导干部们的普遍注意，许多煤矿还听凭这种现象长期存在，没有决心来改变这方面的落后状况。
    燃料工业部的检查小组，在检查本溪矿务局的木材浪费情况的时候，曾在矿区发现了一个奇怪的木材市场。组成这个“市场”的不是普通的木材商人，而是附近的居民。他们经营的也不是成批的完整的木材，而是一些锯断了的大量的断木头。市场的存货相当充足，交易也颇为活跃。据检查组的调查，仅六个住宅区存积的木料，就可以装运二十五节火车。这个木材市场就是本溪矿务局大量浪费坑木的直接产物。
    本溪矿务局所属的几个煤矿，在使用坑木上普遍不爱惜木材，大材小用，被锯掉的木头又随意乱丢。附近的居民便把这些遗弃满地的木材收拾起来，愈积愈多。有些需要零星木头的，就赶来向他们购买，有的人也就以此作为生财之道，这样就终于发展成了这样一个奇怪的“市场”。
    像这样大材小用，长材短用，严重浪费木材的事情，在其他大型国营煤矿里也同样存在着。例如开滦唐山煤矿的七六二一采煤场子，采高只有三尺半，却总是领四尺半、五尺甚至六尺的长坑木，领来不合用就锯，每天这样平均要锯掉二一○根左右的木头，损失三立方公尺以上。
    木材浪费还表现在许多煤矿的木材管理工作不认真，领退料制度不严格，有的矿上工人们可以随便地到储木场去拿坑木，而无须任何手续；有的矿上则是只领料，不退料，结果是一篇糊涂账。燃料工业部曾检查了二十六个储木场，发现有十六个单位的材料都与卡片不符。一九五四年五月以前，开滦煤矿是坑木管理最混乱的单位之一，工作制度不健全，无人负责现象盛行，各采煤区长期积压着大批坑木，也没人去检查过问。有的采煤场子早已结束了，可是材料部门还是照旧往井下发运坑木。有的采煤工作面的高度已由八尺改为五尺，可是坑木还是照八尺的源源送来，井下工人们就把它锯短再用。
    许多煤矿不注意坑木的回收工作，回收复用率很低。焦作矿务局王封矿二一八工作面，一九五四年七、八月份坑木回收率只达百分之十至十二。有些采煤场子，只顾前进，不及时回柱，形成空顶距离太长，顶板压力过大，以致坑木折损率高，回收困难。有时还经常造成切断工作面的事故，使坑木全部被压入老塘。林西煤矿的一个采煤场子，就因为这个原因，有一次发生冒顶事故，损失了坑木一千三百根。也有些采煤场子，他们在放顶时不回收坑木，任意地把大量坑木弃置在老塘里。
    煤矿坑木超支的情况，不是不能克服的。例如，井径矿务局过去坑木经常超支，去年十月间加强了管理，严格控制了坑木消耗，就扭转了坑木超支的局面。唐山煤矿“七一”采煤区，去年第一季度曾超支坑木九八八立方公尺，占全矿超支总数的百分之五十二，四月份学习了北票矿务局坑木管理三级责任制的经验，制订了坑木管理办法，并坚决贯彻执行，结果四月份情况大变：不但没有超支，还节约了木材一百二十九立方公尺。
    上述例子，说明了煤矿坑木的严重超支，主要是坑木的管理不善，有关人员缺乏爱惜国家资财的观念。当然，也还有些其他的原因，例如煤矿生产管理工作组织得不好，生产不正常，地质测量和设计不能正确地指导生产，工资制度也不够合理等等。林业部门供给的坑木，有时也有不合规格的现象，使用时就不免发生浪费。这方面林业部门无疑负有责任。
    煤矿是消耗木材最多的部门之一。据计算，平均产煤两吨，就需要七吋长的圆坑木一根。一个年产二百万吨的煤矿，每年要消耗百万根圆坑木。而这些木材，从产地采伐、加工，而后运到矿山，中间要耗费多少的人力物力。煤矿坑木的超支不仅造成木材——基本建设中不可缺少的重要材料——的大量损失，国家运输力量的浪费，并且还直接抬高了煤的成本，（坑木在煤的成本中一般的约占百分之二十左右）使广大消费者蒙受损失。
    为了国家建设的需要，人们有理由要求国营煤矿的行政管理部门和各地国营煤矿企业的领导上，在庆祝完成一九五四年全年产量和生产总值计划的时候，注意这方面的严重浪费情况，不要让它长期掩盖在这些数字的下边，年年掉在国家计划的后面。
