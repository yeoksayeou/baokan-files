Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 25th: The Hatoyama government announced the dissolution of the House of Representatives last night, January 24th. The election for new members of the House of Representatives will be held on February 27th. This dissolution of the House of Representatives and the holding of a new general election were agreed upon by the Japan Democratic Party and the left and right-wing Socialist Parties last December after the fall of the Yoshida government and before the formal formation of the Hatoyama government.

    Before the House of Representatives was declared dissolved, members of the Diet questioned the government's policies on the 23rd and 24th. The questioning focused on the issue of Japan's relations with China and the Soviet Union. Many Diet members, when discussing the Hatoyama government's expression of willingness to adjust relations with China and the Soviet Union, criticized the government's policy on this issue as not being clear enough. Diet members also criticized the government's proposal to revise the constitution for the purpose of rearmament.

    The Japanese people's desire to break away from American control in order to strive for national independence and peace, and especially the demand for normalization of relations with China and the Soviet Union, is so strong that even the Liberal Party, which had consistently pursued the American "embargo" policy during its time in power not long ago, put forward the proposition of expanding Japan's trade with China and the Soviet Union in the policy adopted at its national congress on the 20th.

    By the time the Japanese House of Representatives was declared dissolved, the Democratic Party held 124 seats, the Liberal Party held 180 seats, the Left-wing Socialist Party held 74 seats, and the Right-wing Socialist Party held 61 seats out of a total of 467 seats. So far, no party has confidently announced that it will become the majority party after the general election. There are persistent reports that American and Japanese business circles hope to maintain the conservative forces in power through the general election and to "stabilize" the political situation.

    日本国会众议院宣告解散
    【新华社二十五日讯】东京消息：鸠山政府已经在二十四日晚宣布解散国会众议院。新的众议员的选举将在二月二十七日举行。这次解散众议院重新举行大选，是日本民主党和左、右两派社会党在去年十二月吉田政府倒台以后鸠山政府正式组成以前就商定了的。
    在众议院宣告解散之前，国会议员在二十三日和二十四日对政府的施政方针进行了质询。质询集中在日本同中苏两国的关系问题上。许多议员在谈到鸠山政府关于愿意调整同中苏两国的关系的表示时，批评政府在这个问题上的政策上态度还不够明确。议员还指责政府修改宪法以进行重整军备的主张。
    日本人民要求摆脱美国的控制以争取民族独立和和平，特别是要求对中国和苏联的关系正常化的情绪是如此强烈，甚至不久以前在执政时期一贯奉行美国的“禁运”政策的自由党，二十日也在它的全国代表大会上通过的政策中，提出要扩大日本同中苏两国的贸易的主张。
    到日本众议院宣告解散的时候为止，在全部四百六十七个议席中，民主党占一百二十四席，自由党占一百八十席，左派社会党占七十四席，右派社会党占六十一席。到现在还没有一个政党有把握地宣布在大选以后它将成为多数党。不断有消息传出，美国和日本经济界希望通过大选使保守势力继续当政，并且使政局“稳定”。
