    Shaoyang Branch Accepts Public Opinion, Re-Sentences Embezzler Du Weisong to Ten Years in Prison
    After this newspaper published a news report on June 4th of last year regarding the expulsion from the Party and sentencing of Du Weisong, the former mine manager and Party Branch Secretary of the Niumasi Coal Mine in Shaoyang, Hunan, to three years imprisonment for embezzlement and degeneration, as well as an editorial entitled "Severely Punish Embezzlement Criminals," we received letters from more than ten readers including Tan Wenji, Tang Guoquan, Dong Jiang, Yu Qingbo, Wang Yingqin, Lu Yi, Sun Shaorong, Wang Suosen, and Shi Zhengxue. They pointed out that before the "Three-Anti" campaign, Du Weisong had stolen and sold grain and rice from the District Peasants' Representative Conference, and had not confessed during the "Three-Anti" campaign. Immediately after the "Three-Anti" movement ended, he used his power and position to systematically steal state property and the fruits of the people's labor, to enable unscrupulous merchants to buy up grain, and to embezzle public funds from the trade union that were meant for purchasing rubber shoes for miners working underground, seriously undermining the state's policy of unified purchase and sale of grain and labor protection laws. According to the revealed materials, Du Weisong was a leading embezzler who repeatedly refused to be reformed, and his embezzlement was extremely vile. According to the principle of "leniency in the past, strictness in the future," a sentence of three years imprisonment was too light. They hoped that we would forward their request to the relevant departments for reconsideration and re-sentencing. After the above-mentioned readers' opinions were forwarded by this newspaper to the Central-South Branch of the Supreme People's Court and the Hunan Provincial People's Court for research, the Shaoyang Branch of the Hunan Provincial People's Court has now replied, stating that regarding the case of embezzler Du Weisong, the Hunan Provincial People's Court reviewed the case file and concluded that, based on the crimes of embezzlement committed by Du, the previous judgment was indeed too lenient. After submitting a request to the higher-level court for approval, the sentence has been changed to ten years imprisonment. The Shaoyang Branch stated that it accepts this lesson and will pay attention to mastering the standards for sentencing.

    邵阳分院接受群众意见改判贪污犯杜维松徒刑十年
    本报在去年六月四日发表前湖南邵阳牛马司煤矿矿长兼党支部书记杜维松贪污蜕化被开除党籍、判处有期徒刑三年的消息，和“从严惩治贪污罪犯”的社论后，就接到谭文玑、唐国权、东江、于清波、王应钦、鲁毅、孙少荣、王锁森、史正学等十多位读者的来信，提出杜维松在“三反”以前就曾盗卖区农民代表会的谷、米，“三反”中未曾坦白交代，“三反”运动刚结束就利用职权和地位，有计划地偷窃国家的财产和人民劳动果实，为奸商抢购粮食和贪污工会给下井工人购买胶鞋的公款，严重地破坏了国家粮食统购统销政策和劳动保护法令。根据所揭发的材料来看，杜维松是屡教不改的首要贪污分子，贪污性质十分恶劣，按照“过去从宽，今后从严”的原则，判处三年有期徒刑实在太轻，希望转请有关部门重新考虑改判。以上读者意见经本报转请最高人民法院中南分院、湖南省人民法院研究后，现已得到湖南省人民法院邵阳分院答复说，关于贪污犯杜维松的案件，由湖南省人民法院调卷审核后，认为根据杜犯贪污罪行，前次判决确属过于轻纵，经呈请上级法院批准，已改判有期徒刑十年。邵阳分院表示接受这一教训，注意掌握量刑标准。
