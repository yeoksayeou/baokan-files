Shuangyashan Coal Mine Workers Overhaul Machines During Spring Festival

Xinhua News Agency Dispatch

To ensure the smooth progress of this year's production, more than 600 mechanical and electrical workers at the Shuangyashan Coal Mine voluntarily gave up their Spring Festival holiday to overhaul the mine's machinery and electrical equipment. They entered the narrow underground tunnels to overhaul equipment such as scraper conveyors, air compressors, and water pumps. The work sites had no electric lights and were very cramped. The workers wore their miner's lamps and worked close to the machines. When disassembling heavier components, due to the small space and too many people, it was difficult to maneuver, so only a few people could painstakingly move them little by little. When the mechanical and electrical workers went down into the mine, they were not allowed to bring kerosene for cleaning the machines to ensure safety underground. After they removed a component, they vigorously wiped it with yarn. When they were tired of wiping, they leaned on the machine to relax. They inspected the machines very carefully, and many hidden and small damages on the machines were found. Overhaul workers Qu Kechang, Qi Xiaoxian, and others found that the screw connecting the piston and handle on the air compressor was broken, and immediately repaired it to prevent accidents.

    双鸭山煤矿工人在春节检修机器
    双鸭山煤矿六百多个机电工人为保证今年生产的顺利进行，自愿放弃春节假期，检修矿井机械和电气设备。他们进入井下狭窄的巷道中检修刮板运输机、压风机和水泵等设备；工作场地没有电灯，又很狭小，工人们带着矿灯，紧靠在机器旁边工作。拆卸较重的部件时，因场地小，人多施展不开，只能由少数人费劲地一点一点挪动它。机电工人们下井时，因为要保证井下安全，不能带擦洗机器用的火油，他们卸下一个部件，就使劲地用纱线擦，擦累了，便伏在机器上舒舒气。他们对机器检查得很仔细，机器上许多隐蔽的细小的损伤都被找出来了。检修工人曲克昌、戚孝先等检查出压风机上连接活塞和柄的螺丝坏了，马上把它修理好，防止它发生事故。（据新华社讯）
