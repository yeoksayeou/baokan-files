    Popularizing New-Style Animal-Powered Farm Implements

    The popularization of new-style animal-powered farm implements is a fundamental measure for reforming agricultural technology, increasing agricultural production, and promoting the cooperative movement in our country during the present and for a considerable period in the future.

    In the past few years, our country has popularized 700,000 new-style animal-powered farm implements, of which various new-style plows account for more than two-thirds. The scope of popularization covers 24 provinces, 1 autonomous region, and the suburbs of 3 municipalities directly under the central government. The experiences of various regions in popularizing new-style animal-powered farm implements prove that even minor improvements in production tools can significantly increase crop yields. Trials using new-style farm implements in conjunction with other agricultural technology improvements have generally resulted in yield increases of one-fifth to one-quarter compared to using old farm implements and techniques. Among these new-style animal-powered farm implements, the double-wheeled double-shared plow and the double-wheeled single-shared plow are the most popular among farmers. These plows have high working efficiency, a wide range of adaptability, can be pulled by various draft animals, and are easy to operate, even for women. In areas where demonstration work has been done well, the masses are vying to order them. Facts have proven that this is the most suitable farm implement for reforming agricultural technology and developing agricultural production in general plain early-cropping areas.

    The changes in rural production relations have prepared favorable conditions for the reform of agricultural technology; the reform of agricultural technology, in turn, can promote the advancement and development of the cooperative movement. At present, individual farmers in our country are neither able to afford nor use new-style animal-powered farm implements; most new-style animal-powered farm implements are owned and used by agricultural producers' cooperatives as public property. Once farmers thoroughly recognize the superiority of new-style animal-powered farm implements, they will be more willing to unite and strive to use these new-style tools. By the time of the spring plowing this year, agricultural producers' cooperatives will have developed to around 600,000. The objective situation requires that the reform of agricultural technology keep pace with the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Doing a good job in popularizing new-style animal-powered farm implements is of great significance for promoting agricultural cooperation.

    Based on the requirements of our country's rural economic development and the speed of national industrialization, the popularization of agricultural machinery will still mainly focus on new-style animal-powered farm implements for a considerable period to come, with a focus on piloting machine tractor stations, and paying attention to supplementing, repairing, and improving old farm implements. The Ministry of Agriculture plans to popularize 400,000 double-wheeled double-shared plows nationwide this year; it is estimated that more than 1.5 million double-wheeled double-shared plows and double-wheeled single-shared plows will be popularized by 1957, so that agricultural producers' cooperatives in areas with suitable conditions can basically use new-style plows for plowing. The plow is the main tool for deep plowing and increasing production; therefore, the popularization of new-style animal-powered farm implements should focus on plows. In areas with the conditions and need for use, the popularization of complete sets of new-style farm implements can be piloted.

    Based on the experience of popularizing new-style farm implements in recent years, it is necessary to adopt very cautious persuasion, education, and typical demonstration methods to do a good job in this work of changing farmers' production habits. Farmers in our country have long been accustomed to using a plow and a hoe for farming. Changing their production habits of many years and replacing old tools with new tools cannot naturally be accomplished overnight. However, as long as farmers see the superiority of new-style animal-powered farm implements with their own eyes and learn how to use them, they will develop a strong interest in new farm implements. Therefore, the key to the success or failure of popularization work lies in truly allowing farmers to see and understand the role of new farm implements. If conditions permit, they should also be shown how to use them. If education and demonstration work are not done well, and there is an over-hasty demand for large-scale popularization, or even simply engaging in compulsory assignment and purchase, it will inevitably be opposed by the masses. In 1952, when new-style walking plows were popularized, due to insufficient attention from the leading organs, failure to pay attention to educating and demonstrating to farmers, and failure to help farmers solve relevant technical problems, there was a blind large-scale popularization, which resulted in many new-style walking plows becoming "hanging plows." This lesson must be remembered.

    In order for this batch of new plows to play a role in the spring plowing this year, technical training work must be done well in the winter. Because new-style farm implements are different from old farm implements. Old farm implements are farm implements that farmers are skilled in using and can be used at any time. New-style farm implements, however, are farm implements that farmers have never used before and are technically more complex. The technology must be taught to farmers before the plowing begins; otherwise, missing this winter will delay a year's time. The agricultural technology popularization stations in various regions should list the popularization of new farm implements as their primary task. The cadres of the popularization stations should learn the technology of using new farm implements. In areas with suitable conditions, the popularization stations should also be equipped with full-time cadres for popularizing farm implements, changing the past practice of only managing general agricultural production increase technology and not paying attention to the popularization of new farm implements.

    Low price, good quality, and convenient repair and parts replacement are important conditions for farmers to purchase and use new farm implements. If this problem is not solved, new-style farm implements cannot be popularized, let alone consolidated. The various farm implement factories must guarantee the quantity and quality of products in accordance with unified standards and production plans, strive to reduce costs, and guarantee the manufacture and supply of parts. It must be ensured that new farm implements can be repaired when they are broken and parts can be replaced when they are missing. A farmer in Henan Province once spent more than 10,000 yuan on train tickets to buy a screw worth 500 yuan and wasted a lot of time, which of course would affect farmers' enthusiasm for using new farm implements. Today, with the large-scale popularization of new farm implements, more attention should be paid to solving the repair and parts replacement work. Some areas can use the iron factories of handicraft production cooperatives to be responsible for repair and parts replacement, or organize and train local iron and woodworkers to be responsible for repair and parts replacement, or organize mobile repair teams to go to the countryside to repair and replace parts for farmers. The most important thing is to train repair technicians for agricultural producers' cooperatives so that repair technology can be mastered by the farmers themselves and the repair problem can be fundamentally solved.

    Some rural work cadres do not understand our country's principles and steps for realizing agricultural collectivization and mechanization, fantasize about "reaching the sky in one step," cherish tractors all day long, and adopt a passive and indifferent attitude towards the popularization of new-style animal-powered farm implements. They regard the future and prospects as already realized things. When they publicize the task of socialist transformation of agriculture to the farmers, they only talk about tractors and do not mention new farm implements, creating various illusions among the masses.

    Our Party has long made it clear that the socialist transformation of agriculture in our country should be carried out in two steps: the first step is to realize cooperation, and the second step is to realize mechanization. The realization of mechanization in our country should also be carried out in two steps. Before our country can mass-produce tractors and gasoline, we can only vigorously promote double-wheeled double-shared plows, double-wheeled single-shared plows, and other new-style animal-powered farm implements on the basis of cooperation, so that agricultural production tools can be initially transformed, and then realize large-scale mechanization after the conditions are met. These steps cannot of course be completely separated. However, in order to achieve a thorough reform on the basis of our country's very backward agricultural technology, we can only adopt a step-by-step approach. It should be understood that without today's new-style animal-powered farm implements, it will not be possible to greatly increase agricultural production and strongly support the cause of national industrialization. Therefore, today's popularization of new-style animal-powered farm implements is precisely for the early production and use of tractors. Moreover, even after tractors are mass-produced, new-style animal-powered farm implements still have a certain role to play. When agriculture in the Soviet Union was about to be fully collectivized and socialist industry was already mass-producing tractors and agricultural machinery, it still opposed the tendency to underestimate the role of horsepower traction. Our country cannot yet manufacture tractors, and some people already look down on new-style animal-powered farm implements. What is the basis for this?

    There are also some people who do not understand the role of changing production tools in improving agricultural production, do not understand the superiority of new-style animal-powered farm implements over old farm implements, and adopt a passive, perfunctory, or even indifferent attitude towards the popularization of new-style animal-powered farm implements. They believe that farmers' original production habits cannot be changed, and that old farm implements can also increase production. Therefore, they are unwilling to actively promote new-style animal-powered farm implements or improve old farm implements. This is a laissez-faire view of agricultural production, which not only deviates from the current actual situation in our country, but also deviates from the urgent demands of farmers. It should also be examined and corrected.

    The popularization of new-style animal-powered farm implements is an economic task and also a political task; in some areas, it is also a completely new task. This work cannot be done well by a few business departments alone. The Party committees in various regions should strengthen leadership and inspection of this work, and strive to do better in the first year of large-scale popularization.

### 推广新式畜力农具

    推广新式畜力农具
    推广新式畜力农具，是我国当前和今后相当长的时期内改革农业技术、提高农业生产和促进合作化运动的一个根本性的措施。
    几年以来，我国已经推广新式畜力农具七十万件，其中各种新式犁约占三分之二以上。推广范围遍及二十四个省、一个自治区和三个直辖市的郊区。各地推广新式畜力农具的经验证明：生产工具的任何微小的改进，都能使农作物的产量显著地增加。各地试用新式农具耕作，再配合其他农业技术的改进，产量一般比用旧农具旧技术耕作要增加五分之一到四分之一。在这些新式畜力农具中，双轮双铧犁、双轮一铧犁最受农民的欢迎。这种犁耕作效率很高，适应范围较广，各种耕畜都能曳引，而且操作轻便，妇女也能使用。示范工作作得好的地区，群众争相订购。事实证明，这是当前一般平原早作地区改革农业技术，发展农业生产最适宜的一种农具。
    农村生产关系的变化，给农业技术的改革准备了良好的条件；农业技术的改革，又可促进合作化运动的前进和发展。当前我国的个体农民还无力置备也无法使用新式畜力农具；多数新式畜力农具是作为公共财产，由农业生产合作社置备和使用的。当着农民彻底认识新式畜力农具的优越性后，他们就会比较顺利地联合起来，争取使用这种新式工具。到今年春耕以前、农业生产合作社将发展到六十万个左右。客观的形势要求农业技术的改革跟上互助合作运动的发展，作好新式畜力农具的推广工作，对于促进农业合作化实有很大的意义。
    根据我国农村经济发展的要求和国家工业化的进展速度，在今后相当长时期内，农业机械的推广还只能以新式畜力农具为主，有重点地试办机器拖拉机站，并注意增补、修配和改良旧农具。农业部计划今年在全国推广双轮双铧犁四十万部；预计到一九五七年推广双轮双铧犁和双轮一铧犁一百五十万部以上，使有条件的地区的农业生产合作社基本上都能用新式犁耕地。犁是深耕增产的主要工具，因此，新式畜力农具的推广应以犁为主。在有条件和必要使用的地区，可试行推广成套的新式农具。
    根据几年来推广新式农具的经验，要做好这种改变农民的生产习惯的工作，必须采取十分慎重的说服教育和典型示范的方法。我国农民长期习惯于用一张犁、一张锄进行耕作，要改变他们多少年来的生产习惯，用新的工具代替旧的工具，自然不是一朝一夕所能办到的。但是，只要农民亲眼看到新式畜力农具的优越性，并且学会使用的方法，他们对新农具就会发生浓厚的兴趣。因此，推广工作成败的关键在于真正让农民看到和懂得新农具的作用，如果条件允许，还应先给他们作出怎样使用的样子。如果不作好教育和示范工作，过急地要求大量推广，甚至简单从事，强迫派购，必然遭到群众的反对。一九五二年推广新式步犁时，由于领导机关重视不够，不注意对农民进行教育和示范，不注意帮助农民解决有关的技术问题，就盲目大量推广，结果使许多新式步犁变成“挂犁”。这种教训必须记取。
    要使今年推广的这批新犁在春耕中发挥作用，必须在冬季作好技术训练工作。因为新式农具和旧农具不同。旧农具是农民用之有素的农具，是随时都能使用的农具。新式农具却是农民根本没有用过的农具，是技术比较复杂的农具。必须在开犁前把技术教给农民，否则，错过这个冬季，就将延误一年的时间。各地的农业技术推广站应该把新农具的推广工作列为自己的首要任务，推广站的干部要学会新农具的使用技术，在有条件的地区，推广站中还应配备专职的农具推广工作干部，改变过去只管一般农业增产技术，而不过问新农具推广工作的作法。
    价廉物美，修配方便，是农民购置和使用新农具的重要条件。这个问题如不解决，新式农具就不能推广，更无法巩固。各农具工厂要按照统一标准和生产计划，保证产品的数量质量，努力降低成本，保证零件的制造和供应。必须作到新农具坏了有处修，零件缺了有处配。河南省曾有一个农民，为买一个价值五百元的螺丝，消耗一万多元的火车费，并且浪费了许多时间，这当然会影响农民使用新农具的情绪。在新农具大量推广的今天，修配工作更要注意加以解决。有些地区可利用手工业生产合作社的铁工厂负责修配，或组织训练地方的铁、木工人负责修配，或组织巡回修配组下乡给农民修配。最重要的是培养农业生产合作社的修配技术手，使修配技术为农民自己所掌握，从根本上解决修配问题。
    有些农村工作干部不了解我国实现农业集体化和机械化的方针和步骤，幻想“一步登天”，终日怀念拖拉机，而对推广新式畜力农具采取消极应付、漠不关心的态度。他们把前途、远景当作已经实现的事物。他们对农民宣传关于农业社会主义改造的任务时，只说拖拉机，不提新农具，在群众中造成了各种错觉。
    我们党早已明确指出，在我国实行农业社会主义改造，要分为两步走：第一步实现合作化，第二步实现机械化。而在我国实现机械化，也要分作两步走。在我国还不能大量生产拖拉机和汽油以前，只能在合作化的基础上，大力推广双轮双铧犁、双轮一铧犁和其他新式畜力农具，使农业生产工具得到初步改造，而在条件具备以后，再实现大规模机械化。这些步骤当然是不能截然分开的。但是，要在我国非常落后的农业技术基础上实现彻底的改革，却只能采取循序渐进的办法。应该了解：没有今天的新式畜力农具，就不能大量增加农业生产，有力地支援国家工业化的事业，因此，今天推广新式畜力农具，正是为了早日生产和使用拖拉机。而且就是在大量生产拖拉机之后，新式畜力农具还有一定的作用。苏联在农业即将全盘集体化，社会主义工业已经大批生产拖拉机和农业机器的时候，还在反对过低估计马匹曳引力的作用的偏向。我国现在还不能制造拖拉机，有些人已经看不起新式畜力农具，这有什么根据呢？
    还有一部分人，不理解生产工具的改变对于提高农业生产的作用，不理解新式畜力农具对于旧农具的优越性，也对新式畜力农具的推广采取消极敷衍甚至不闻不问的态度。他们认为农民原有的生产习惯是不能改变的，认为旧农具也能增加生产，因此就不愿积极推广新式畜力农具或改良旧农具。这是一种对于农业生产的自流观点，它不仅脱离了我国当前的实际状态，而且脱离了农民的迫切要求，同样是应该加以检查纠正的。
    新式畜力农具的推广是一项经济工作，也是一项政治工作；在某些地区还是一项全新的工作。这种工作单靠几个业务部门是做不好的。各地党委要加强对这一工作的领导和检查，在大规模推广的第一年，力争做得好一些。
