The Hu Shi Thought Criticism Discussion Committee held its first critical discussion meeting on Hu Shi's views on the history of Chinese philosophy in Beijing on the 20th. More than 90 philosophy, thought, and education history professors and researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Marxist-Leninist Academy, Renmin University of China, Peking University, Beijing Normal University, and the Central Institute for Nationalities, as well as those interested in the history of philosophy, participated in the discussion.

The meeting discussed Feng Youlan's article entitled "Philosophy History and Politics." In this paper, Feng Youlan started with Hu Shi's evaluation of Confucius and Lao Tzu, and criticized Hu Shi's reactionary philosophical history viewpoint.

Pan Zinian, Hou Wailu and eight others expressed their opinions on Feng Youlan's paper at the meeting. They raised suggestions for modifying certain arguments and problem formulations in the paper; they made supplementary opinions on the content of the paper. Some people believed that this paper should further analyze the roots of Hu Shi's reactionary thoughts as manifested in the work of Chinese philosophical history. (Xinhua News Agency)

Wuhan University teachers attach importance to the criticism of Hu Shi's reactionary academic thoughts in scientific research work. Li Da, President of Wuhan University, is writing a paper criticizing Hu Shi's reactionary thoughts. Li Da also gave a report entitled "Criticism of Hu Shi's Academic Thoughts" to all teachers and students of the Chinese Language Department, History Department, and some teachers and students of other departments of Wuhan University.

All teachers of the History Department of Wuhan University held a forum on December 31 last year on the issue of "Hu Shi's Reactionary Academic Thoughts and Its Poisonous Influence in the Historical Field." The teachers who spoke at the meeting unanimously believed that Hu Shi's reactionary academic thoughts had a deep influence in the historical field, so they expressed that they would strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and deeply expose and criticize Hu Shi's thoughts.

Teachers of the Chinese Department of Wuhan University have held a forum to criticize Hu Shi's philosophical thoughts. Now some teachers are preparing to analyze Hu Shi's reactionary thoughts in literature. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

On January 9, a literary and art lecture criticizing erroneous viewpoints in the study of "Dream of the Red Chamber" was held in Nanjing.

Literary and art workers, educators, some cadres and students from Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City, totaling 3,000 people, attended the lecture. The lecture was jointly organized by the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Nanjing Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the Nanjing Library. It was decided to hold three lectures, with topics such as: "How to Correctly View 'Dream of the Red Chamber'" and "What Lessons Should We Accept in the Study of Criticizing the Idealistic Thoughts in the Study of 'Dream of the Red Chamber'?"

    批判胡适的反动哲学史观点
    南京举行批判“红楼梦”研究中错误观点的文艺讲座
    胡适思想批判讨论会工作委员会二十日在北京举行关于胡适的中国哲学史观点的第一次批判讨论会。参加讨论会的有中国科学院、马克思列宁学院、中国人民大学、北京大学、北京师范大学、中央民族学院等单位的哲学史、思想史、教育史教授和研究工作者以及对哲学史有兴趣者共九十多人。
    会议根据冯友兰的题为“哲学史和政治”一文进行了讨论。冯友兰在这篇论文中从胡适对孔子、老子的评价说起，对胡适的反动哲学史观点作了批判。
    会上对冯友兰的论文发表意见的有潘梓年、侯外庐等十人。他们对论文中的某些论点和问题的提法提出了修改的意见；对论文的内容提出了补充意见。其中有的人认为这篇论文还应该进一步分析胡适表现在中国哲学史工作中的反动思想的产生根源。（新华社）
    武汉大学教师在科学研究工作中重视对胡适反动学术思想的批判。武汉大学校长李达正在撰写批判胡适反动思想的论文。李达并曾向武汉大学中国语文系、历史系全体师生及其他系的部分师生作过题为“胡适学术思想的批判”的报告。
    武汉大学历史系的全体教师在去年十二月三十一日就“胡适的反动学术思想及其在史学界的流毒”问题举行了座谈会。会上发言的教师一致认为胡适的反动学术思想在史学界的影响是深的，因此他们纷纷表示要加强马克思列宁主义的学习，深入地揭露和批判胡适思想。
    武汉大学中文系教师已举行过批判胡适哲学思想的座谈会。现在一部分教师正在准备对胡适在文学方面的反动思想进行分析。（据新华社讯）
    一月九日在南京举行了批判“红楼梦”研究中的错误观点的文艺讲座，讲题是“俞平伯对‘红楼梦’的研究错误究竟在哪里？”听讲的有江苏省和南京市的文艺工作者、教育工作者、部分干部和学生共三千人。这个讲座是由江苏省文学艺术工作者联合会、南京市文学艺术工作者联合会、南京图书馆等单位联合举办的。这一讲座决定举行三次，题目有：“怎样正确看待‘红楼梦’”、“我们在批判‘红楼梦’研究的唯心思想的学习中应该接受哪些教训”等。（新华社）
