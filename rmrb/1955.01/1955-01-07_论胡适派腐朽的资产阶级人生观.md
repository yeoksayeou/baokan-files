In pre-liberation China, facing the rapidly changing social life and the unprecedentedly severe struggle between revolution and counter-revolution, many intellectuals who had not yet joined the revolution were troubled and bewildered in their pursuit of a direction in life. At this time, all sorts of bourgeois worldviews took the opportunity to deceive and anesthetize the masses in the old China's ideological market. Hu Shih was one of those who peddled the most reactionary and corrupt bourgeois worldviews.

Hu Shih used many disguises in some of his statements on the question of worldviews. Like his American mentor, Dewey, Hu Shih tried his best to conceal his subjective idealist views and his face of serving the most reactionary exploiting class. But the essence of Hu Shih's thought could not be concealed. By dissecting some of the basic arguments of Hu Shih's worldview, it can be seen what kind of decadent and vicious worldview can be derived from a completely reactionary and anti-scientific worldview and view of history.

I

During the May Fourth Movement, Hu Shih began to promote his individualistic ideas. In 1930, when writing "Introducing My Own Thoughts," Hu Shih took his "Ibsenism" article published in 1918 as one of the representative works of his worldview. He boasted:

"This article of mine only writes about a kind of healthy individualistic worldview." (See Recent Works on Learning, p. 634) In 1935, in an article written to "commemorate" the May Fourth Movement—actually to distort the May Fourth Movement—Hu Shih even attempted to portray his individualistic worldview as the representative of the "new trends of thought" of the May Fourth era (see "Independent Review," issue 150).

Bourgeois individualism is always inseparable from despicable egoism. But Hu Shih was unwilling to admit this. He once specifically argued that "there is a distinction between 'real' and 'false' individualism," and that false individualism "is egoism, its nature is selfishness: it only cares about one's own interests and disregards the interests of the masses" (Collected Works, vol. 4, p. 174), and Hu Shih claimed that he did not approve of this kind of individualism.

Was Hu Shih really against selfishness? Hu Shih revealed his true intentions when recommending the remarks of Fei Mi, a scholar of the Qing Dynasty. According to Hu Shih's introduction, Fei Mi denied the "righteous principles" of the Song Confucianists, but did not put forward a new standard of "righteous principles" to oppose the ruling ideology of feudal patriarchal society; Fei Mi said: "Life is what people cherish very much; wives and children are what people deeply love; property is what people value most; fame is what people yearn for most; hunger, cold, hardship, and humiliation are what people find difficult to endure; worries, dangers, and predicaments are what people think of avoiding; righteousness is what people respect together. But how can one only take righteousness and abandon everything else without considering the circumstances?" This statement was very much to Hu Shih's liking. Hu Shih said: "Mr. Fei regards life, wives, property, etc., as things equally important as righteousness, teaching people to look at these various factors together, and not to judge people solely on 'righteousness.' This is truly a fair and honest attitude." (Collected Works, Second Series, vol. 1, p. 129)—Bourgeois individualism must be selfish, it must be for the sake of one's own "life, wives, property, fame." The highest "righteousness" of the bourgeoisie is actually one's own "life, wives, property, fame." Hu Shih himself has already confessed to this.

Hu Shih, during the period when the people's revolutionary movement led by the Chinese proletariat was constantly surging, came out and vehemently promoted individualism. His purpose was to corrode the thinking of the Chinese people, to undermine the collectivist spirit that they had developed through struggle, and especially to corrode the thinking of intellectuals, preventing them from integrating with the workers and peasants.

Hu Shih portrayed society as composed of independent individuals. He wanted to make people believe that solving the problems of society as a whole meant solving the problems of each individual, so he said: "Liberation" is "the liberation of this person and that person, it is liberation bit by bit"; "transformation" is "the transformation of this person and that person, it is transformation bit by bit" (Collected Works, vol. 4, p. 164).

Actual life shows that without the collective strength to strive for national freedom and liberation, and for the freedom and liberation of the people, the Chinese people will not have individual freedom and liberation. The Chinese people had long ago acquired this understanding and carried out this struggle. Hu Shih's individualistic thinking was to confuse this understanding of the people and to disintegrate this struggle of the people.

Hu Shih once said that his individualism had two key points: first, "to fully develop individual talents," and second, "to create free and independent personalities" (Independent Review, issue 150). Like others who peddle bourgeois ideas, Hu Shih often uses the idea of developing personality and individual independence to promote a despicable individualistic worldview. Hu Shih especially utilized the ideas of Ibsen. The thought of the 19th-century Norwegian playwright Ibsen was a petty-bourgeois thought. Ibsen openly expressed contempt for the masses and only valued individuals and a few people, praising the spirit of individuality and individual freedom and independence in opposition to society. This is what Hu Shih utilized.

It should be pointed out that ideas such as the liberation of human nature and individual independence can contain various different contents, which can be progressive or reactionary. Striving for freedom and independence from backward and reactionary forces has progressive significance, but announcing "freedom and independence" to the progressive masses of the people is reactionary. Based on this principle of distinction, the thoroughly reactionary nature of the individualism and personality theories of Hu Shih and his ilk can be exposed.

Ibsen lived in a country that had already established a capitalist system, but had not yet had a revolutionary proletariat or fierce class struggle. Around him, he only saw the vulgar petty-bourgeois masses, whose bodies deeply reflected the hypocrisy and moral degradation of bourgeois society, as reflected in many of Ibsen's plays. It is reasonable that Ibsen had no hope for these masses and hated them. Ibsen's respect for individual thought was linked to his vague idea of seeking progress. Since he was far from capable of foreseeing the working class's ability to create a new society, he could only place his idea of seeking progress on individual or a few people. Plekhanov, in analyzing Ibsen's thought and its influence, pointed out that the bourgeoisie in advanced capitalist countries welcomed Ibsen's thought and sympathized with Ibsen's attacks on the "majority"; but the "majority" they spoke of was not the same as the "majority" Ibsen spoke of. Because in those capitalist countries, the "majority" was the proletariat; therefore, Plekhanov said, "The 'majority' that Ibsen attacked are those who do not understand all progressive efforts; while those who sympathize with Ibsen are precisely those who fear the progressive efforts of the 'majority'" (regarding Ibsen's thought, see Plekhanov's "Ibsen's Success," translated by Qu Qiubai, see Qu Qiubai's Collected Works, vol. 4).

In modern China, the conscious liberation struggle of the masses of the people has formed a surging torrent. Under these social conditions, Ibsen's thought can no longer have any positive significance. Only those who cannot see the progressive struggle of the masses of the people developing in actual life, who dare not participate in this struggle, and even those who deliberately oppose this struggle place individual freedom and independent personality on the basis of individualism detached from the masses. Hu Shih consciously distorted and utilized Ibsen, using Ibsen's name to promote bourgeois individualism and spread evil ideas of hatred for the people's revolution.

Hu Shih often quoted Ibsen's words: "The strongest man in the world is the man who stands most alone." But it should be known that the "isolated man" that Ibsen spoke of is the man who opposes the vulgar citizen masses steeped in bourgeois thought. And what is the "isolated man" that Hu Shih speaks of? That is the man who opposes the revolutionary masses, the man who opposes the struggle of the masses seeking progress. Facts prove that the Ibsen-style "isolated man," if he finally cannot combine with the revolutionary working class, cannot be truly powerful either; while the kind of "isolated man" that Hu Shih speaks of, despite thinking himself "the strongest," will certainly be crushed by the power of the people.

Ibsen foresaw the decline of the capitalist system, but could not see the real force that could bury this system—the force of the proletariat. So he said in a sad tone: "Sometimes I really feel that the whole world is like a ship that has sunk at sea, and the most important thing is to save oneself." This sentence, after being quoted and elaborated by Hu Shih, had a very bad influence on some intellectuals in our country. Hu Shih's explanation of this sentence was: "The most ridiculous thing is that some people, knowing that the world is 'sinking,' still want to follow the 'sinking,' follow the depravity, and refuse to 'save themselves'! They don't know that society is composed of individuals, and saving one more person means preparing one more element for rebuilding a new society. Therefore, Mencius said, 'When poor, cultivate your own virtue in solitude,' which is what Ibsen meant by 'save yourself.' This kind of 'egoism' is actually the most valuable altruism" (Collected Works, vol. 4, p. 33). The "sinking" that Hu Shih speaks of actually refers to the revolution, and he uses the saying "save yourself" to lure people away from the patriotic movement of the masses, away from the revolutionary struggle.

Many statements made by Hu Shih against the mass revolutionary movement can prove this. For example, during the revolutionary upsurge after the May 30th Movement in 1925, Hu Shih wrote: "Mass movements are always unsustainable." "We can conclude that most of the victims of mass movements are wasted in vain." (Collected Works, Third Series, p. 1147) After slandering the masses of the people in this way, he quoted Ibsen's words to "very sincerely" advise young people to practice "true individualism," saying: "We only hope that everyone knows: following others in running around and shouting slogans in a turbulent period cannot be considered fulfilling the responsibility of patriotism. There is also a more difficult and valuable task: in the midst of the chaotic shouts, to be able to stand firm, make up your mind, save yourself, and strive to cast this piece of material of yours into something useful" (ibid., p. 1153).

Hu Shih's remarks during the December 9th Student Movement were also a clear example. As everyone knows, the student movement of 1935 played a pioneering role in the great Anti-Japanese National Liberation War. Many young intellectuals improved their level of consciousness through this movement, embarked on the road of integrating with the workers and peasants, and found a reliable force for saving the country. At this time, Hu Shih's article viciously slandered the student movement as "manipulation by a few people," as "shallow incitement," as "blind obedience, gullibility, dogmatism, oppressing the minority, deceiving the masses," etc. At the same time, he pretentiously said: "The student movement must pay attention to cultivating individual personalities who can be free and independent and also abide by the law and be public-spirited. A group of young people who are blindly led by the nose will never have real strength in school, and will only be fit to be obedient citizens and slaves when they leave school." He also deceived and enticed young people, saying: "Only desperately cultivating personal knowledge and ability is the real preparation for serving the country" (Independent Review, issue 182). It is very clear here that the so-called "free and independent individual personality" is "free and independent" from the mass revolutionary movement that promotes historical progress, and on the other hand, it is "public-spirited and law-abiding" towards the order of imperialism and its running dogs ruling China. This is truly the "individual personality" that is only fit to be a slave and an obedient citizen!

Hu Shih regarded individualistic thought as a new trend of thought during and after the May Fourth period, which is completely inconsistent with the facts. As early as before the May Fourth Movement, during the period when the bourgeoisie led the Chinese revolution, many petty-bourgeois and bourgeois advanced elements had already advocated individual liberation in the name of individualism. Although they had the weakness of not acknowledging and fearing the power of the masses, because they were in a historical condition where there was no conscious and large-scale struggle of the working people, and their advocacy of individual liberation was a resistance against the feudal ruling forces and feudal ruling ideas, this kind of thought had a certain degree of progressive significance at that time. But by the time of the May Fourth Movement, especially after the "May Fourth," bourgeois individualism was no longer an advanced new trend of thought, and could no longer play a leading role in actual life. It had been replaced by the socialist collectivist trend of thought.

Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On New Democracy": "Before the 'May Fourth,' the struggle on China's cultural front was a struggle between the new culture of the bourgeoisie, and the old culture of the feudal class... However, because of the weakness of the Chinese bourgeoisie and the world's entry into the era of imperialism, this bourgeois thought could only go into battle for a few rounds before being defeated by the reactionary alliance of the enslavement ideology of foreign imperialism and the restoration ideology of Chinese feudalism. With a slight counterattack from this ideological alliance of reaction, the so-called new learning lowered its banners, announced its retreat, lost its soul, and only left its body." The individualistic worldview was also a part of the bourgeois new culture before the "May Fourth." After the "May Fourth," Hu Shih only utilized the body that it had left behind after losing its progressive soul, and filled it with the content of opposing the people's revolution and serving imperialism and its running dogs.

For the broad masses of the people, in the old China ruled by imperialism and its running dogs, it was fundamentally impossible to fully develop individual talents and obtain a free and independent personality. Bourgeois thought could not solve this problem. The people's revolution led by the proletariat transformed the old China into a new China of the people, which enabled the people who had always been oppressed and enslaved to develop a free and independent personality, and to develop all their individual talents. Comrade Mao Zedong had already pointed out in "On Coalition Government" that "the liberation of the personalities and the development of the individualities of hundreds of millions of people" is one of the main contents of the thorough democratic revolution.

On the basis of the complete victory of the people's democratic revolution, our people further struggle to build a socialist society. Imperialism and its running dogs slander the socialist system, saying that it obliterates individuals and eliminates individuality, but in fact, it is the socialist system that can open up broad paths for the all-round development of individuals of the broad working people, and it is the collective interests of socialism that can fully guarantee the individual interests of the broad working people. This is why the broad working people of China actively and consciously strive for the socialist cause. The Chinese people have long clearly seen that only from the people's revolutionary cause and the socialist cause can true individual liberation and individual development be realized, and that individual liberation and individual development on the basis of collectivism are valuable and beneficial to the people. Many intellectuals in China have realized the reactionary nature of bourgeois personality theory, and have embarked on the road of combining with the workers and peasants; the more loyally they serve the people, the more they feel the fullness of their individual lives and the greatness of their individual futures, and the more they can fully develop their talents and wisdom.

Socialist collectivism makes every ordinary worker feel that he is a real person, a person who can control his own destiny, a person with a dignified and independent personality. When people add their share of strength to the great cause of promoting historical progress that is being carried out together by hundreds of millions of people, they truly feel the noble meaning of life and the strong confidence in life. Collectivism makes people consciously subordinate individual interests to public interests, thereby breaking away from the concept of selfishness, which the exploiting classes consider innate. Our moral concept is fundamentally opposed to this concept of selfishness. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "A man's ability may be great or small, but as long as he has this spirit"—the spirit of utter devotion to others without any thought of self, "he is a noble man, a pure man, a moral man, a man who is free from low tastes, and a man who is of benefit to the people." (See "In Memory of Norman Bethune") This noble morality of ours is something that bourgeois individualists cannot even imagine.

In the process of building a socialist society, the struggle against bourgeois individualistic thought has extremely important significance. As our above analysis of Hu Shih's thought shows, the role of bourgeois individualistic thought in our country's current social conditions is to drive people to pursue individual interests that are opposed to the common interests of the entire nation, and to develop individuality that is opposed to the collective cause of socialism. This is an extremely despicable and extremely shameful "personality" and "individuality." Allowing the influence of this kind of thought to develop means destroying the socialist cause, destroying the interests of the motherland, and destroying the interests of the working people themselves.

II

Individualism is the main body of Hu Shih's worldview. The "naturalistic worldview" put forward by Hu Shih is closely combined with his "individualistic worldview."

In the "Preface to Science and Worldview" written by Hu Shih in 1923, he put forward the so-called "naturalistic worldview." He endorsed Wu Zhihui's set of "theories," declaring that this was "the new worldview we believe in," saying that "this new worldview is a grand hypothesis built on the basis of two or three hundred years of scientific common sense, we may add the honorable title of 'scientific worldview' to it. But in order to avoid unnecessary disputes, I propose to call it 'naturalistic worldview.'" (Collected Works, Second Series, vol. 2, p. 27)

Wu Zhihui was a typical example of the most despicable and shameless character produced among modern intellectuals. As early as 1903, he secretly reported to the Qing officials in the "Subao" case in Shanghai, betraying the then revolutionaries Zou Rong and Zhang Taiyan. Later, he went to Europe and transformed himself into an "anarchist," saying that he advocated implementing "anarchy" in three thousand years. Before and after the May Fourth Movement, he ate from the hands of the Northern Warlords, while talking emptily about science and empty talk about anarchism to deceive the world and steal his name. After 1925, he was a Kuomintang right-wing element who firmly opposed cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and became a capable strategist for Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the revolution, and then he was always an old dog gnawing bones under the table of the four big families, until he died like a dog in Taiwan after the national liberation. This Wu Zhihui invented a set of so-called cosmology and worldview in order to whitewash his unscrupulous life. According to his saying, all things are "living things," and people are the same as flies and stones in the toilet. It can be said that even the stones in the toilet have the same feeling as people: "The feelings of all things are unequal, not equal; difference is the difference in state, not the height of degree"; but it can also be said that people are the same as stones and do not have any feelings: "Stones in the toilet, rose trees, flies, people, why have any feeling, any psychology, any soul, only the structure and reaction of matter and force are different." In short, people are no different from all other living things and all non-living things. Therefore, the existence of a certain person in the world is the same as the existence of a fly or a stone in the world. Wu Zhihui said: "The so-called life is an animal that uses hands and brains, it is its turn to appear on stage and sing in the 'Cosmic Grand Theater' in the 100 millionth * gai 800 billion 600 million 570,000th act. Please observe like this, which is called a worldview." So how should one live? The answer is, since one has "appeared on stage and sing," one should "seriously" sing a performance. He added: "But I don't think that only the new play of two-handed animals should be sung seriously. Even the play of wood and stone, the play of deer and pigs, should be just as serious. You and I, dear readers, are not wood and stone, nor deer and pigs, but just two-handed people, so we discuss this play, and we should also sing it wonderfully, that's all."

(The above are all from "A New Faith's Cosmology and Worldview")

What kind of worldview is this? This is a waste of people, an insult to life. Looking at the following two passages spewed out of Wu Zhihui's mouth can better show the actual meaning of the worldview he said. "Use 111 pounds of clear water, 60 pounds of colloid, 4 pounds 3 ounces of protein, 4 pounds 5 ounces of fiber, and 12 ounces of oil, meet appropriately, and combine to become 147 pounds of me. In my name, blindly follow the rules of this physical world, mess around casually for a while, no matter how far it goes, until the clear water, oil, colloid, and other substances of me separate on their own." - This is his confession before the Xinhai Revolution (1909). (See "Letter to a Friend on the Physical World and the Inconceivable") "...So everything in the world is empty, what else is there to be nostalgic for? What else is there to do? Yes, it is originally empty, but what else can we do if we don't do anything? We do it as if we are acting in a play, and we always have to work hard when acting in a play, even if we are just messing around, we have to mess around once, that's what life is like." - He said these shameless words in 1926 (see "Science and Life").

It is certainly appropriate for a character like Wu Zhihui to consistently hold this kind of worldview. This base person who lives like a fly in a cesspool is completely worthy of this kind of worldview. Compared with this kind of worldview, some pessimistic and world-weary thoughts are even much more noble. Because some pessimistic and world-weary people are still suffering because they live boringly, but Wu Zhihui's dark worldview is to promote to people: live like animals, that's all there is to life, be a pickpocket, a swindler, be a murderer, betray friends for glory, do anything that harms heaven and reason, "seriously" "earnestly" "mess around"! Life should be like this! Wu Zhihui calls himself a "worldview of rampant human desires," and we can agree with this title. It is conceivable what kind of vicious influence this dark worldview would have on some intellectuals who could not see the way out of life in the old society.

In 1923, Hu Shih's group, led by Ding Wenjiang, launched a debate on the question of worldview with Zhang Junmai, calling themselves a struggle between "science and metaphysics." In fact, Ding Wenjiang, who claimed to represent science, blatantly promoted corrupt subjective idealism in this debate. At this time, Wu Zhihui wrote an article that was truly as so-called like a foot-binding cloth, smelly and long, called "A New Faith's Cosmology and Worldview." Hu Shih said that it was all thanks to this article that the question of what exactly a "scientific worldview" was was answered. In this article, Wu Zhihui complimented Hu Shih as "the representative of recent Chinese thought"; by 1928, when Wu Zhihui had already shown great skill in anti-communist activities, Hu Shih also complimented Wu Zhihui as "a young pioneer in the ideological circles." "Birds of a feather flock together," all the stones in the cesspool emit the same stench and admire each other, this is certain.

Hu Shih fully accepted Wu Zhihui's statement and tried his best to put "materialistic" and "scientific" decorations on it. But where is there any smell of materialism in Wu Zhihui's whole set of statements? Wu Zhihui said that his cosmology can be called "a completely dark universe," that is to say, before the birth of the universe, there was only a chaotic "completely dark." How did all things arise from "completely dark"? He said: "When it is completely dark, there is naturally will first, and then change begins." So according to him, this "completely dark" is "living," and all things that are produced from this are also "living," so he said that he agrees with Bergson's saying that "the universe is a great life." This is obvious idealism, it is to imagine a mysterious and unknowable will as the driving force for the growth and development of all things. From this idealistic and mystical cosmology, he deduced the absurd statement that people and all other living things and non-living things are nothing but the descendants of "completely dark," "only the difference in state, not the height of degree," and thus developed his "worldview of rampant human desires."

Hu Shih summarized his "naturalistic worldview" into ten statements (see Collected Works, Second Series, vol. 2), some of which are very easy to mislead people, and even make people think that Hu Shih said a little bit of materialism here. There is such a statement in the ten statements: "Based on all sciences, it tells people that the operation and change of the universe and all things in it are natural, - they are so themselves, - there is no need for any supernatural master or creator." But this kind of wording is worthless in Hu Shih's mouth. The bourgeoisie does not need to exclude natural science, it wants to use natural science for its own interests. The reactionary bourgeoisie can also admit that general natural phenomena can be explained by natural science knowledge, and that the operation and change of every natural phenomenon is not determined by the will of the so-called "God." But admitting this does not prevent it from giving a fundamental idealistic explanation to natural phenomena and natural science knowledge, so that religion still has a full foothold. Hu Shih and his gang all worship natural science, but Ding Wenjiang combines natural science knowledge with subjective idealistic empiricism, while Wu Zhihui, as mentioned above, uses a statement similar to objective idealism to put a mystical hat on natural phenomena. Hu Shih agrees with both of these very much. Therefore, Hu Shih's statement quoted above is not related to materialism.

Hu Shih fully understood that under the social conditions of modern China, it would be very unwise to openly put forward concepts such as God, God, and the will determines everything in the so-called "cosmology," so he often used the method of "reserving and not discussing" to avoid it. His main task was to deny the laws of social and historical development, and to open the door to idealism in terms of social outlook and historical outlook. Therefore, at least four of his "naturalistic worldview" are directly aimed at confusing natural phenomena and social phenomena. One is: "Based on the knowledge of biology, physiology, and psychology, it tells people that man is just one of the animals, and that he and other animals only have differences in degree, and there is no difference in kind." - This is completely repeating Wu Zhihui's words. There are also three: "Based on the knowledge of biological science and anthropology, ethnology, and sociology, it tells people the history of the evolution of organisms and human society and the reasons for evolution." "Based on biological and psychological science, it tells people that all psychological phenomena have causes." "Based on biological and sociological knowledge, it tells people that morality and etiquette are changing, and the reasons for the changes can all be sought out by scientific methods." Although these three statements use a lot of the word "science," in fact, the wording of these statements already shows that they are anti-scientific and anti-materialistic. It is very clear here that it is necessary to use biological knowledge to explain various social phenomena (including social ideologies), and when biology is not enough, add the so-called "sociology" of the bourgeoisie. As everyone knows, all schools of bourgeois sociology use idealistic viewpoints to explain the "reasons for the evolution of human society" and the "reasons for the change of morality and etiquette." Bourgeois sociology is not going to discover the objective laws of social and historical development, but to deny and obscure objective laws. Therefore, this kind of sociology can completely be an appendage of the "naturalistic worldview."

Only Marxism-Leninism - dialectical materialism and historical materialism can discover the scientific laws of social and historical development, and thus can truly scientifically solve the problem of worldview. People always live in certain social relations. Regarding people only as an animal in nature, separating people from the entire social relationship, this is an anti-scientific viewpoint, and it is of course impossible to scientifically solve the problem of worldview.

First, because Marxism deeply analyzes the class relations of society, it proves that the existence of various different and mutually opposed worldviews in class society is completely understandable, and they are precisely the reflections of the interests of the various different and mutually opposed classes and strata.

Second, Marxism uses objective, scientific, rather than subjective, arbitrary standards to evaluate various different worldviews, that is, according to the laws of historical development, it sees the position of each class and stratum under various specific historical conditions, and thus points out that this worldview is advanced and that worldview is reactionary.

Third, Marxism uses the laws of natural and social historical development to guide the modern masses of the people led by the proletariat, so that they can fully and clearly understand the goals of their struggle, and can correctly exert their subjective initiative to transform the world; Marxism gives people's efforts to pursue progress a scientific basis.

Marxism is able to scientifically solve the problem of worldview precisely because of these things.

Marxism's worldview, view of history, and worldview are completely consistent. The Marxist worldview is built on the basis of the dialectical materialist worldview and historical view. Marxism exposes all worldviews that play a reactionary role in modern life and are detrimental to the masses of the people, and guides the masses of the people to establish a healthy, progressive, and truly scientific worldview.

The degenerate bourgeoisie has escaped into the naturalistic and mystical air-raid shelters, precisely because they dare not face the objective laws of social and historical development, and they dare not face the class essence of the differences between various different worldviews. They want to use the saying that people are nothing but an animal in nature to deny the meaning of life, and to guide people to the blind, subjectivist path in social life, which will inevitably be the despicable path of selfish individualism.

Hu Shih wrote two short articles with the general title of "What is the Meaning of Life" in 1928 and 1929. One of them said: "Life itself is only a biological fact, what meaning is there to say? What is the difference between giving birth to a person and a cat or a dog?" "In short, life has no meaning in itself. You give it what meaning, and it has what meaning." Another short article said: "Life is indeed but a dream. But one only has this one chance to dream in one's life, how can one not strive to make a vigorous and decent dream?" (Collected Works, Third Series, p. 1143) - This is completely the same tone as the above-mentioned statements of Wu Zhihui, equally reflecting the despair and crazy psychology of the declining reactionary group itself, and also showing its sinful attempt to lure the thinking of the people into the dirtiest quagmire.

III

Hu Shih sometimes emphasizes the responsibility of people to society, as if he is neither talking about individualism nor talking about naturalism. But in fact, when he makes this kind of argument, he is still developing his individualistic worldview and his naturalistic worldview.

The tenth statement in Hu Shih's ten statements on the naturalistic worldview says: "Based on the knowledge of biology and sociology, it tells people that the individual - the 'small self' - is going to die, and that humanity - the 'big self' - is immortal, imperishable; it tells people that 'living for the whole species for all ages' is religion, is the highest religion; and those religions that seek 'heaven' and 'pure land' for the individual after death are selfish religions." (Collected Works, Second Series, vol. 2, p. 27) - Hu Shih uses this kind of statement to make people unable to grasp his true meaning at once, and this kind of statement has great deceptiveness. Hu Shih has developed this kind of statement in many places, and we need to further analyze it.

Hu Shih told readers that any behavior of a person can have endless influence in the entire society due to accidental opportunities, which is simply incredible. He gave many examples: a blind man is playing the three-stringed instrument, and a poet happens to hear it, and this poet writes a good poem that is passed down for thousands of years. A poor man dies of illness, and his corpse rots on the street, and a prince happens to see it, and a thought arises in the prince's mind, and Buddhism is created from this. And so on (Collected Works, vol. 4, p. 114).

So what? What conclusion can be drawn from this? Hu Shih said triumphantly that from here, a remarkable philosophy of life can be established, called the "immortality of society." Hu Shih said: "I do not believe in the theory of the immortality of the soul, nor do I believe in the theory of heaven and hell, so I say that this small self will die. Death is a universal phenomenon of all living things, not to be feared, nor to be regretted. But the individual has his immortal part. All his actions, all his merits and demerits, all his words and deeds, no matter how big or small, no matter how good or bad, no matter how right or wrong, leave indelible results and influences on that big self. He spits a mouthful of saliva on the ground, and perhaps it can destroy a village or a tribe, he has an idea, and perhaps it can cause decades of bloody battles. He may 'a word can make a country prosper, a word can make a country perish.' Good is also immortal, evil is also immortal; it is certainly immortal to have meritorious deeds that cover the world, and it is also immortal to plant a load of grain, and it is also immortal to drink a cup of wine and spit a mouthful of saliva." (Recent Works on Learning, p. 636)

So what? What conclusion can be drawn from this? Hu Shih said sternly that this makes people know that they must be responsible to society. "To say a word and not dare to forget the social impact of this word, to take a step and not dare to forget the social impact of this step. This is to be responsible for the big self. Being able to do this is morality, is religion." (ibid.) - The tenth of Hu Shih's naturalistic worldview mentioned above is also derived from this.

The anti-scientific and reactionary nature of Hu Shih's set of statements lies on the one hand in the fact that he uses absolute accidentalism to deny the regularity in the development of social history, thereby extremely exaggerating the role of the individual and advocating blind subjectivism. On the other hand, it is that he uses the so-called "big self" to cancel the characteristics of social life and deny the distinction between social classes, as if the exploiters and the exploited, the oppressors and the oppressed all belong to the same "big self."

Therefore, this statement is precisely made from the stinking pool of individualism and naturalism, mysticism.

Hu Shih's statement about the mutual influence of all things obviously has nothing in common with the viewpoint of dialectical materialism. Because in Hu Shih's view, there are only countless individual things that are confusedly arranged, and there are various accidental interactions between them, so there is no regularity. Starting from this metaphysical viewpoint, it is possible to get the absurd conclusion that a drop of water may affect the entire universe, and when applied to social life, it is also possible to get the absurd conclusion that a mouthful of saliva may change the fate of all mankind. According to Hu Shih's statement, it is completely uncertain what influence a person's every move in social life will have, it is completely determined by many accidental opportunities. Then the only conclusion can only be: people cannot predict the consequences of their own actions, and therefore cannot bear any responsibility to society, and therefore life can only be like what Wu Zhihui said, "blindly follow the rules of this physical world, mess around casually."

The real situation of social and historical development is of course not like this. Although there are many complex and accidental connections in the phenomena of social and historical development, the social and historical process has

    论胡适派腐朽的资产阶级人生观
    胡绳
    在解放前的中国，面对着激烈变化的社会生活，面对着空前严重的革命和反革命的斗争，有许多尚未参加革命的知识分子为追求生活的方向而苦恼彷徨。这时，形形色色的资产阶级人生观乘机在旧中国的思想市场上向群众进行欺骗和麻醉。胡适就是贩运最反动、最腐败的资产阶级人生观的一个人。
    胡适在关于人生观问题的一些言论中用了许多伪装。同他的美国师傅杜威一样，胡适竭力掩藏他的主观唯心主义的观点和为最反动的剥削阶级服务的面目。但是胡适思想的本质当然是掩盖不住的。剖开胡适的人生观的一些基本论点，就可以看到，从完全反动的、反科学的世界观和历史观出发，就会引导出怎样的腐朽恶毒的人生观。
    一
    五四运动时期，胡适开始宣传他的个人主义思想。到了一九三○年，胡适写“介绍我自己的思想”时把他在一九一八年发表的“易卜生主义”一文当做他的人生观的代表作品之一，他吹嘘说：
  “我这篇文章只写得一种健全的个人主义的人生观”。（见论学近著页六三四）胡适在一九三五年为表示“纪念”五四运动——其实是为歪曲五四运动而写的文章中，甚至企图把他的个人主义人生观说成是五四时代的“新思潮”的代表（见“独立评论”一五○期）。
    资产阶级的个人主义总是和卑鄙的利己主义不可分的。但胡适不愿意承认这一点。他曾特别辩解说：“个人主义有‘真的’和‘假的’之分”，假的个人主义“就是为我主义，他的性质是自私自利：只顾自己的利益，不管群众的利益”，（文存卷四页一七四）而胡适自称是不赞成这种个人主义的。
    胡适真是反对自私自利么？胡适在推荐清朝的
  一个学者费密的言论时泄漏了他的真心话。照胡适的介绍，费密否认宋儒的“义理”之说，但并没有提出一种新的“义理”的标准来反对封建宗法社会的统治思想；费密说的是：“生命，人所甚惜也；妻子，人所深爱也；产业，人所至要也；功名，人所极慕也；饥寒困辱，人所难忍也；忧危陷厄，人所思避也；义理，人所共尊也。然恶得专取义理，一切尽舍而不合量之欤？”这种说法很合胡适的胃口。胡适说：“费氏把生命、妻子、产业等等，和义理看作同样重要的东西，教人要把这各种分子合起来看，不可单拿‘义理’一种来评判人。这真是平允忠厚的态度。”（文存二集卷一页一二九）——资产阶级的个人主义必然是自私自利的，必然是为了自己的“生命、妻子、产业、功名”打算的，资产阶级的最高的“义理”其实就是个人的“生命、妻子、产业、功名”。胡适自己已经把这点招认了。
    胡适在中国无产阶级领导的人民革命运动不断高涨的时期，出来声嘶力竭地宣传个人主义，其目的是在腐蚀中国人民大众的思想，破坏他们通过斗争而锻炼起来的集体主义精神，其目的又特别是在腐蚀知识分子的思想，阻止他们去和工农群众相结合。
    胡适把社会说成是由一个个各自独立的人组成的。他想使人相信，解决整个社会问题就是解决一个个人的问题，所以他说：“解放”是“这个那个人的解放，是一点一滴的解放”；“改造”是“这个那个人的改造，是一点一滴的改造”（文存卷四页一六四）。
    实际生活表明，不用集体的力量去争取民族的自由和解放，争取人民的自由和解放，中国人民是不会有个人的自由和解放的。中国人民早已取得了这种认识，进行了这种斗争。胡适的个人主义思想就是为了混淆人民的这种认识，瓦解人民的这种斗争。
    胡适曾说，他的个人主义有两个要点，第一是
  “充分发展个人的才能”，第二是“要造成自由独立的人格”。（独立评论第一五○期）胡适同其他贩卖资产阶级思想的人一样，常常用发展个性和人格独立等等说法来推销卑劣的个人主义人生观。胡适特别利用了易卜生的思想。十九世纪挪威的剧作家易卜生的思想是一种小资产阶级思想。易卜生公开表示轻视群众而只重视个人和少数人，赞扬同社会对立的个性和个人自由独立的精神。胡适所利用的就是这一点。
    应该指出，人性解放和人格独立等等说法可以包含各种不同的内容，可以是进步的内容，也可以是反动的内容。向落后的反动的势力争取自由独立是有进步意义的，但是向争取进步的人民群众宣布
  “自由独立”，那就是反动的。根据这种原则的区别，才能揭穿胡适一流人所说的个性论和人格论的彻底反动性。
    易卜生生活在已经建立了资本主义制度，但还没有革命的无产阶级，还没有激烈的阶级斗争的国家里。在他周围，他只看见庸俗的小资产阶级群众，这些群众的身上深刻地表现着资产阶级社会的虚伪和道德堕落，如同易卜生的许多剧本中所反映的那样。易卜生对这种群众不存希望并痛恨他们，这是合理的。易卜生的尊重个人的思想是同他的曚昽的求进步的观念相联系着的。他既远没有能力预见工人阶级创造新社会的能力，他就只能把他的求进步的观念寄托在个别的或少数人的身上了。普列哈诺夫在分析易卜生的思想及其影响时曾指出，先进的资本主义国家的资产阶级欢迎易卜生的思想，同情易卜生对“多数”的攻击；但他们所说的“多数”和易卜生所说的“多数”并不相同。因为在那些资本主义国家里，“多数”就是无产阶级；所以普列哈诺夫说，“易卜生所攻击的‘大多数’，是那些不了解一切进步的努力的人；而同情于易卜生的，却正是恐惧‘大多数’的进步努力的人”（关于易卜生的思想，参看普列哈诺夫作“易卜生的成功”，瞿秋白译，见瞿秋白文集第四卷）。
    在现代中国，人民大众的自觉的解放斗争已经形成汹涌的巨流。在这种社会条件下，易卜生的思想已不可能有什么积极的意义。只有看不见在实际生活中发展着的人民大众的进步斗争的人，不敢参加这种斗争的人，以至蓄意反对这种斗争的人才把个性自由，人格独立放在脱离群众的个人主义的基础上。胡适正是有意识地歪曲利用了易卜生，用易卜生的名义来宣传资产阶级的个人主义，散播仇视人民革命的邪恶的思想。
    胡适常常引用易卜生的话：“世上最强有力的人就是那最孤立的人”。但是应该知道，易卜生所说的“孤立的人”乃是同浸透了资产阶级思想的庸俗的市民群众相对抗的人。而胡适所说的“孤立的人”是什么呢？那是同革命群众相对抗的人，是同求进步的群众斗争相对抗的人。事实证明，易卜生式的
  “孤立的人”如果终于不能和革命的工人阶级相结合，也不可能是真正强有力的；而胡适所说的那种
  “孤立的人”，尽管自以为“最强有力”，却一定会被人民群众的力量压得粉碎。
    易卜生预感到资本主义制度的没落，但是看不到能够葬送这种制度的真实的力量——就是无产阶级的力量。所以他用悲伤的调子说：“有的时候我真觉得全世界都像海上撞沉了船，最要紧的还是救出自己”。这句话经过胡适的引用并加以发挥后，曾在我国一部分知识分子中起了很坏的影响。胡适对这句话的说明是：“最可笑的是有些人明知世界‘陆沉’，却要跟着‘陆沉’，跟着堕落，不肯‘救出自己’！却不知道社会是个人组成的，多救出一个人便是多备下一个再造新社会的分子。所以孟轲说，
  ‘穷则独善其身’，这便是易卜生所说的‘救出自己’的意思。这种‘为我主义’其实是最有价值的利人主义”（文存卷四页三三）。胡适所说的“陆沉”实际上是指革命，他用“救出自己”的说法来引诱人们脱离群众的爱国运动，脱离革命斗争。
    胡适针对群众革命运动所发表的许多言论都可以做证明。例如在一九二五年五卅运动后革命高潮期间胡适写道：“群众运动总是不能持久的。”“我们可以断定，民众运动的牺牲者的大部分是白白地糟蹋了的。”（文存三集页一一四七）他这样地诽谤了人民群众以后，就引用了易卜生的话来“很诚恳”地劝告青年实行“真正的个人主义”，他说：“我们只希望大家知道：在一个扰攘纷乱的时期里跟着人家乱跑乱喊，不能就算是尽了爱国的责任，此外还有更难更可贵的任务：在纷乱的喊声里，能立定脚跟，打定主意，救出你自己，努力把你这块材料铸成个有用的东西”（同上，页一一五三）。
    一二九学生运动时胡适的言论也是一个明显的例子。大家知道，一九三五年的学生运动对伟大的抗日民族解放战争起了先锋的作用，许多知识青年通过这次运动提高了觉悟水平，走上同工农群众相结合的路，找到了救国的可靠力量。胡适这时所写的文章恶毒地诬蔑学生运动是“少数人的把持操纵”，是“浅薄的煽惑”，是“盲从、轻信、武断，压迫少数，欺骗群众”等等，同时他装腔作势地说：“学生运动必须注意到培养能自由独立而又能奉公守法的个人人格。一群被人糊里糊涂牵着鼻子走的少年人在学校时决不会有真力量，出了校门也只配做顺民，做奴隶而已。”他又骗诱青年说：“只有拚命培养个人的知识和能力是报国的真正准备工夫”。（独立评论一八二期）这里说得很明白，所谓“自由独立的个人人格”，乃是“自由独立”于推动历史前进的群众革命运动之外，而在另一方面，则是对帝国主义及其走狗统治中国的秩序“奉公守法”。这才真正是只配做奴才和顺民的“个人人格”！
    胡适把个人主义思想当做五四时期和五四以后的新思潮，这是完全不合乎事实的。早在五四运动以前，资产阶级领导中国革命的时期，已经有许多小资产阶级和资产阶级的先进分子用个人主义的名义提倡个性解放。他们虽然有不承认和害怕群众力量的弱点，但是因为当时是在还没有劳动人民的自觉的广大的斗争的历史条件下，而他们主张个性解放是向封建统治势力和封建统治思想进行抗争，所以这种思想在当时是有一定程度的进步意义的。但是到了五四运动时期，尤其到了“五四”以后，资产阶级的个人主义已经不是什么先进的新思潮，更绝不能够在实际生活中起领导作用。代替它的，已经出现了社会主义的集体主义的思潮。
    毛泽东同志在“新民主主义论中”说：“在 ‘五四’以前，中国文化战线上的斗争，是资产阶级的新文化和封建阶级的旧文化的斗争。……可是，因为中国资产阶级的无力和世界已经进到帝国主义时代，这种资产阶级思想只能上阵打几个回合，就被外国帝国主义的奴化思想和中国封建主义的复古思想的反动同盟所打退了，被这个思想上的反动同盟军稍稍一反攻，所谓新学，就偃旗息鼓，宣告退却，失了灵魂，而只剩下它的躯壳了”。个人主义的人生观思想也就是“五四”以前的资产阶级新文化中的一个部分。胡适在“五四”以后只是利用了它所留下来的失掉进步灵魂的躯壳，而在这里面装进了反对人民革命并为帝国主义及其走狗服务的内容。
    对于广大人民说来，在帝国主义及其走狗统治下的旧中国，要充分发展个人的才能和取得自由独立的人格，是根本不可能的。资产阶级思想不能解决这个问题。无产阶级领导的人民革命使旧中国变成人民的新中国，才使得从来被压迫被奴役的人民能够发展自由独立的人格，能够发展个人的一切才能。毛泽东同志早已在“论联合政府”里指出，
  “几万万人民的个性的解放和个性的发展”是彻底的民主革命的主要内容之一。
    我国人民在人民民主革命的彻底胜利的基础上进一步为建设社会主义社会而斗争。帝国主义及其走狗诬蔑社会主义制度，说它是抹煞个人，消灭个性，但事实上，正是社会主义制度能够为广大劳动人民开辟个人的全面发展的广阔道路，正是社会主义的集体利益能够充分保障广大劳动人民的个人利益。这就是为什么中国广大劳动人民积极地自觉地为社会主义事业而努力的原因。中国人民早已明确地看出，只有从人民革命事业和社会主义事业中才能实现真正的个性解放和个性发展，在集体主义的基础上的个性解放和个性发展才是有价值的，有利于人民的。中国的许许多多知识分子觉悟到资产阶级个性论的反动性质，走向了和工农人民群众相结合的道路；他们愈是忠诚地为人民服务，就愈感到自己个人的充实和个人前途的远大，愈能够充分发展自己的才能和智慧。
    社会主义的集体主义使每一个普通的劳动者感到自己是一个真正的人，是能够支配自己命运的人，是具有庄严的独立的人格的人。当人们把自己的一份力量加入在几万万人一起进行着的推动历史进步的伟大事业中时，就真正感觉到生活的崇高意义和对生活的坚强信心。集体主义使人自觉地把个人利益服从于公共利益，从而摆脱了剥削阶级认为天性的自私自利观念。我们的道德观念是和这种自私自利观念根本对立的。毛泽东同志说：“一个人能力有大小，但只要有这点精神”——毫无自私自利之心的精神，“就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”（见“纪念白求恩”）我们的这种高尚的道德是资产阶级个人主义者根本不能设想的。
    在为建设社会主义社会的过程中，反对资产阶级个人主义思想的斗争具有极为重要的意义。像我们上面对胡适思想的分析所表明的，资产阶级个人主义思想在我国现在社会条件下所起的作用就是驱使人们去追求同全国人民的共同利益相对抗的个人利益，去发展同社会主义的集体事业相对抗的个性。这是极端卑鄙的、极端可耻的“人格”和“个性”。听任这种思想的影响发展，就是破坏社会主义事业，破坏祖国的利益，也就是破坏了劳动人民自己的利益。
    二
    个人主义是胡适的人生观思想的主体。胡适所提出的“自然主义人生观”是和他的“个人主义人生观”密切结合着的。
    胡适在一九二三年所作的“科学与人生观序”中提出了所谓“自然主义的人生观”。他给吴稚晖的一套“理论”捧场，宣称这就是“我们信仰的新人生观”，说是“这种新人生观是建筑在二三百年的科学常识之上的一个大假设，我们也许可以给他加上‘科学的人生观’的尊号。但为避免无谓的争论起见，我主张叫他做‘自然主义的人生观’。”（文存二集卷二，页二七）
    吴稚晖是近代知识分子中产生的最下贱最不要脸的一个典型人物。他最早在一九○三年就在上海的“苏报”案中向满清官员告密，出卖了当时的革命家邹容和章太炎。后来他到欧洲摇身一变而为“无政府主义者”，说是主张在三千年后实行“无政府”。五四运动前后他一面在北洋军阀的门下混饭吃，一面空谈科学，空谈无政府主义来欺世盗名。一九二五年后，他是坚决反对国共合作的国民党右派分子，并且成为蒋介石背叛革命的得力策士，以后就一直是四大家族餐桌下啃骨头的一匹老狗，直到在全国解放后像狗一样地死在台湾。这个吴稚晖为了粉饰他的寡廉鲜耻的生活，发明了一套所谓宇宙观和人生观。按照他的说法，一切事物都是“活物”，人同苍蝇，同毛厕里的石头都是一样的。既可以说，连毛厕里的石头也同人一样有感觉：“万物的感觉是差等的，不是同等的；差等乃是状况的异同，不是程度的高下”；但也可以说，人同石头一样并没有什么感觉：“毛厕里的石头呀，玫瑰树呀，苍蝇呀，人呀，何尝有什么感觉，什么心理，什么灵魂，止质与力之构造及反应，各各不同罢了”。总之，人同其他一切生物和一切无生物并无两样。因此，世界上有了某一个人就同世界上有了一个苍蝇或一块石头一样。吴稚晖说：“所谓人生，便是用手用脑的一种动物，轮到‘宇宙大剧场’的第亿垓八京六兆五万七千幕，正在那里出台演唱。请作如是观，便叫做人生观”。那么到底应当如何生活呢？答复是，既然“出台演唱”了，就“认真”地唱一场吧。他又补充说：“我却并不以为止有两手动物的新剧该当唱得认真。便是什么木石戏，鹿豕戏，都该一样的认真。我与读者先生们，都不是个木石，都不是个鹿豕，止是个两只手的人，所以我们商量着这幕戏，我们也应当唱得精彩，如是的罢了”。
  （以上均见“一个新信仰的宇宙观及人生观”）
    这是什么人生观？这是对人的糟蹋，对人生的侮辱。再看看以下两段从吴稚晖嘴巴里吐出来的话更可表明他所说的人生观的实际意义。“用清水一百十一磅，胶质六十磅，蛋白质四磅三两，纤维质四磅五两，油质十二两，会逢其适，凑合而成一百四十七磅之我。即以我之名义，盲从此物理世界之规则，随便混闹一阵，闹到如何地步，即以我之清水油胶等质，各自分离而后止”。——这是他在辛亥革命前（一九○九年）的自白。（见“与友人论物理世界及不可思议书”）“……那么世界一切都是空的，还有什么留恋呢？还要干什么呢？是的，本来是空的，但是不干又做什么？我们干好像是做戏，做戏总要努力，就是瞎闹也要闹一回，人生就是这样”。——这样无耻的话是他在一九二六年说的（见“科学与人生”）。
    吴稚晖这样的角色一贯地抱着这样的人生观当然是很恰当的。这个活得像粪坑里的苍蝇一样的卑贱的人同这种人生观是完全配得上的。跟这种人生观比较起来，某些悲观厌世的思想甚至还要高尚得多。因为某些悲观厌世的人还是因为自己活得无聊而痛苦，但吴稚晖的这种黑暗的人生观却是向人鼓吹：像畜牲一样地活下去吧，人活着不过是这么回事，去当扒手、骗子吧，去当杀人犯吧，去卖友求荣吧，去干任何伤天害理的事吧，去“认真”地“努力”地“混闹”吧！人生就该是如此！吴稚晖自称是“人欲横流的人生观”，我们可以同意这个称呼。这种黑暗的人生观在旧社会中对于一些看不清人生出路的知识分子会起什么恶毒的影响是可以想见的。
    一九二三年胡适的一伙人以丁文江为首向张君劢进行了一场关于人生观问题的论战，他们自称为
  “科学与玄学”之争。其实自称代表科学的丁文江在这场论战中是露骨地宣扬了腐朽的主观唯心主义。吴稚晖就在这时写了一篇真是所谓像裹脚布一样又臭又长的叫做“一个新信仰的宇宙观及人生观”的文章。胡适说全靠这篇文章才解答了“科学的人生观”到底是什么的问题。吴稚晖在这篇文章里恭维胡适是“最近的中国思潮的代表者”；到了一九二八年，吴稚晖已在反共活动中大显身手时，胡适也把吴稚晖恭维做“思想界里一个打先锋的少年”。“物以类聚”，所有的粪坑里的石块都发散着同样的臭味，并互相欣赏，这是一定的。
    胡适全盘接受了吴稚晖的说法，并竭力给它加上“唯物的”、“科学的”等等装璜。其实吴稚晖的全套说法里那里有什么唯物论的气味？吴稚晖说，他的宇宙观可以叫做“漆黑一团的宇宙观”，那就是说，当宇宙万有未生之先，只是混混沌沌的
  “漆黑一团”。从“漆黑一团”怎样产生万物？他说：“当漆黑一团之际，自然先有意志，才起变动”。所以照他说来，这“漆黑一团”是“有生命的”，从此产生出来的万物也都是“有生命的”，所以他说，他赞成柏格森的“宇宙为一大生命”之说。这是明明白白的唯心主义，是设想了一种神秘的不可知的意志来作为万物生长和发展的推动力。由这种唯心主义的神秘主义的宇宙观，他才推论出了人和其他一切生物无生物都无非是“漆黑一团”的子孙，“只有状况的异同，不是程度的高下”等等荒谬说法，从而发挥了他的“人欲横流的人生观”。
    胡适把他的“自然主义的人生观”概括成十条说明（见文存二集卷二），其中有些说法很易使人迷惑，甚至使人以为胡适在这里说了一点唯物论。十条中有这么一条：“根据于一切科学，叫人知道宇宙及其中万物的运行变迁皆是自然的，——自己如此的，——正用不着什么超自然的主宰或造物者”。但这种词句出在胡适的嘴巴里是一钱不值的。资产阶级本来不需要排斥自然科学，它是要为自己的利益而利用自然科学的。反动的资产阶级也可以承认，一般自然现象都能用自然科学知识来解释，并不是每一个自然现象的运行变迁都由所谓
  “上帝”的意志来决定。但承认这一点并不妨害它从根本上给自然现象和自然科学知识以唯心主义的解释，让宗教仍有充分的立脚点。胡适这一帮人都崇拜自然科学，但丁文江把自然科学知识和主观唯心主义的经验论相结合，而吴稚晖如前所述是用类似客观唯心主义的说法来给自然现象戴上神秘主义的帽子。胡适对这二者都很赞成。所以上引的胡适的说法和唯物主义是不相干的。
    胡适完全懂得，在现代中国的社会条件下，如果在所谓“宇宙论”上公然提出神啊，上帝啊，意志决定一切啊等等观念是很不聪敏的，所以他常用
  “存而不论”的方法闪避开去。他的主要任务是否认社会历史的发展规律，在社会观历史观方面给唯心主义敞开大门。所以在他的“自然主义的人生观”中至少有四条是直接以混同自然现象和社会现象为目的的。有一条是：“根据于生物学、生理学、心理学的知识，叫人知道人不过是动物的一种，他和别种动物只有程度的差异，并无种类的区别。”——这完全是复述吴稚晖的话。还有三条是：“根据于生物的科学及人类学、人种学、社会学的知识，叫人知道生物及人类社会演进的历史和演进的原因”。“根据于生物的及心理的科学，叫人知道一切心理的现象都是有因的”。“根据于生物学及社会学的知识，叫人知道道德礼教是变迁的，而变迁的原因都是可以用科学方法寻求出来的”。这三条虽然用了好多“科学”的字眼，但其实这些条文的字面已经表明它们是反科学，反唯物主义的。这里说得很清楚，是要用生物学的知识来解释种种社会现象（包括社会意识形态），而在生物学不够用的时候，再加上资产阶级的所谓“社会学”。大家知道，资产阶级的各派社会学都是用唯心主义的观点来解释“人类社会的演进的原因”和“道德礼教变迁的原因”的。资产阶级社会学不是要去发现社会历史发展的客观规律，而是否认和蒙蔽客观规律。所以这种社会学是完全可以做“自然主义人生观”的附属物的。
    只有马克思列宁主义——辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义能够发现社会历史发展的科学规律，因而能够真正科学地解决人生观问题。人总是生活在一定的社会关系中的。把人只是当做自然界中的一个动物，把人和整个社会关系脱离开来，这就是一种反科学的观点，当然不可能科学地解决人生观问题。
    第一，由于马克思主义深刻地分析了社会的阶级关系，因而证明了在阶级社会中存在着各种不同的和互相对立的人生观是完全可以理解的，它们正是各个不同的和互相对立的阶级、阶层的利益的反映。
    第二，马克思主义根据客观的、科学的而不是主观的、任意的标准来评价各种不同的人生观，这就是，根据历史发展规律而看出在各个具体历史条件下各个阶级阶层所处的地位，从而指明，这种人生观是先进的，那种人生观是反动的。
    第三，马克思主义用自然和社会历史的发展规律来指导现代以无产阶级为首的人民大众，使他们能够完全清醒地认识自己的奋斗的目标，并且能够正确地发挥主观能动性以改造世界；马克思主义使人的追求进步的努力有了科学的依据。
    马克思主义之所以能够科学地解决人生观问题，就是因为这些。
    马克思主义的世界观、历史观和人生观是完全一致的。马克思主义的人生观建筑在辩证唯物主义的世界观和历史观的基础上。马克思主义揭发一切在现代生活中起反动作用的，对人民大众不利的人生观，而指导人民大众建立健康的、进步的、真正科学的人生观。
    堕落的资产阶级逃到了自然主义、神秘主义的防空洞里，就是因为他们不敢正视社会历史发展的客观规律，他们不敢正视各种不同的人生观的区别的阶级实质。他们想用人不过是自然界中的一个动物这种说法来否定人生的意义，而把人引导到在社会生活中盲目的、主观主义的路上去，也就必然是自私自利的个人主义的卑鄙的路上去。
    胡适在一九二八年和一九二九年写过两段总题为“人生有何意义”的短文。其一说：“生命本身不过是一件生物学的事实，有什么意义可说？生一个人与一只猫、一只狗有什么分别？”“总之，生命本没有意义。你要给他什么意义，他就有什么意义”。另一短文说：“人生固然不过一梦。但一生只有这一场做梦的机会，岂可不努力做一个轰轰烈烈像个样子的梦呢？”（文存三集，页一一四三）——这和前面所指出的吴稚晖的那些说法完全是一个调子，同样是反映着没落的反动集团自己的绝望和疯狂的心理，也表现了它想把人民的思想引诱到最肮脏的泥坑中去的罪恶企图。三
    胡适有时又着重地说人对于社会的责任，好像他既不是讲个人主义、也不是讲自然主义。但实际上当他发这种议论时，他仍旧是在发挥他的个人主义人生观和他的自然主义人生观。
    胡适对自然主义人生观所作的十条说明中第十条说：“根据于生物学及社会学的知识，叫人知道个人——‘小我’——是要死灭的，而人类——‘大我’——是不死的，不朽的；叫人知道‘为全种万世而生活’就是宗教，就是最高的宗教；而那些替个人谋死后的‘天堂’‘净土’的宗教，乃是自私自利的宗教。”（文存二集卷二页二七）——胡适用这种说法来使人一下子捉摸不定他的真义，这种说法是有很大的欺骗性的。胡适在许多地方发挥了这种说法，我们需要进一步来做一些分析。
    胡适向读者说，一个人的任何行为，都会因为偶然的机会而在整个社会中发生无穷无尽的影响，简直不可思议。他举出了好些例：一个瞎子在弹三弦，不料被一个诗人听见，这个诗人就写了首好诗，流传万世。一个穷人病死了，尸首烂在街上，不料被一个王太子看见，王太子心中起了一念，由此就创造了佛教。等等等等（文存卷四页一一四）。
    那么怎么样呢？由此可以得到什么结论呢？胡适得意地说，从这里就可以建立一种了不起的人生哲学，叫做什么“社会的不朽论”。胡适说：“我不信灵魂不朽之说，也不信天堂地狱之说，故我说这个小我是会死灭的。死灭是一切生物的普遍现象，不足怕，也不足惜。但个人自有他的不死不灭的部分。他的一切作为，一切功德罪恶，一切语言行事，无论大小，无论善恶，无论是非，都在那大我上留下不能磨灭的结果和影响。他吐一口痰在地上，也许可以毁灭一村一族，他起一个念头，也许可以引起几十年的血战。他也许‘一言可以兴邦，一言可以丧邦’。善亦不朽，恶亦不朽；功盖万世固然不朽，种一担谷子也可以不朽，喝一杯酒，吐一口痰也可以不朽。”（论学近著页六三六）
    那么又怎样呢？由此又可以得到什么结论呢？胡适板起脸说，这样就使人知道要对社会负责任了。“说一句话而不敢忘这句话的社会影响，走一步路而不敢忘这步路的社会影响。这才是对于大我负责任。能如此做，便是道德，便是宗教。”（同上）——上面所说胡适的自然主义的人生观的第十条也就是由此而来的。
    胡适的这套说法的反科学性和反动性，一方面就在于他是用绝对的偶然论来否认社会历史发展中的规律性，从而极度夸张个人的作用，宣扬盲目的主观主义。另一方面是他用所谓“大我”的说法来取消社会生活的特点，否认社会阶级的区别，好像剥削者和被剥削者，压迫者和被压迫者都属于同一个“大我”。
    因此，这种说法正是从个人主义和自然主义、神秘主义的臭水缸里面泡制出来的。
    胡适关于万事万物都相互影响的说法同唯物辩证法的观点显然没有任何相同之处。因为在胡适看来，只有纷然杂陈的无数个别的事物，它们之间发生种种偶然的相互作用，因而是没有什么规律性的。从这种形而上学的观点出发来看自然界，可以得到一滴水也许可以影响全宇宙的荒谬结论，而用到社会生活上来，也就可以得到一口痰也许改变全人类的命运的荒谬结论。照胡适的说法，人在社会生活中一举一动会起什么影响，是完全不确定的，完全是由许多偶然的机会来决定的。那么唯一的结论只能是：人对于自己的行为的后果不能预知，因而对社会也就不能负任何责任，因而人生就只好像吴稚晖所说，“盲从此物理世界之规则，随便混闹一阵”。
    社会历史发展的真实状况当然不是这样的。在社会历史发展现象中虽然也有许多复杂的偶然的联系，但是社会历史过程有其根本的必然的规律，这种根本的规律性反映了现象的本质的联系，表现着历史和社会生活的真实的基础。偶然性所起的作用是不能不受到历史规律性的限制和支配的。只有掌握了历史规律性，人们才能知道如何有效地进行努力来推动历史的进步。我们决不把我们的努力建筑在偶然性上，决不设想，“也许”轻轻一反掌，结果就使天地变色。只有没落的反动阶级，因为他们的愿望在实际上根本违反客观的规律，才只好像赌徒一样盲目地挣扎，想依靠偶然性来实现自己的目的。
    美国的实用主义者詹姆士有一段被胡适多次引用的话，露骨地表明了这种依靠偶然性的赌徒心理。我们不妨也来引用一下。
    据詹姆士说，上帝向世人发布了这样的号召：“我给你一个机会，请你加入这个世界。你知道我不担保这世界平安无事的。这个世界是一种真正冒险事业，危险很多，但是也许有最后的胜利。这是真正的社会互助的工作。你愿意跟来吗？你对你自己和那些旁的工人，有那么多的信心来冒这个险么？”对于这个号召，詹姆士说，许多人是退缩了，因为“他们不敢相信机会”。但是，詹姆士表白他自己的态度：“我吗？我愿意承认这个世界是真正危险的，是须要冒险的；我决不退缩，我决不说‘我不干了’！”“不赌那会赢？我愿意赌，我就赌，我就大胆地赌去，只当我不会输的！”（见文存二集卷二页二五四，页二五五，注意点是我加的——绳）
    凶恶，无赖，明知自己没有把握而要蛮干到底——这个五十年前的美国资产阶级哲学家的口吻简直是把美帝国主义的全部真面目活生生地表现了出来。请大家再读一下詹姆士的“上帝”所说的话，那岂不就是美帝国主义特务间谍机关的头子在招募党徒时说的话么？采取詹姆士所表示的态度的人，当然就是这些特务间谍机关所能招到的最好的徒众。美帝国主义所需要的就是接受这种人生观的人，这种不顾一切的盲目的疯狂的强盗和赌棍。
    美帝国主义的走狗胡适向中国读者赞扬詹姆士说：“他这种态度也有他的独到的精神”（同上），而且胡适还把詹姆士的这种看法美其名曰“创造的人生观”。胡适又说：“这种人生观詹姆士称为
  ‘改良主义’。这种人生观也不是悲观的厌世主义，也不是乐观的乐天主义，乃是一种创造的‘淑世主义’。”（文存，卷二，页一○七）——这里所说的淑世主义和改良主义是同一个英文字的译名。于是我们又看到了胡适在人生观上的另一个主义。这个自称最反对谈“主义”的胡适自己在人生观上就有那么多的“主义”！
    胡适经常宣传的所谓一点一滴的进化的思想同他的人生观思想是有密切关系的，但此地不想全面地分析批判他的改良主义思想。此地只想指出，胡适所推荐的帝国主义的所谓改良主义人生观，不仅是用所谓一点一滴的进化来反对革命，而且反映了在没落过程中作着无望的挣扎的反动阶级的心理：他们当然不会乐观，因为自己也知道赌下去可能输得精光；但也不容许悲观，因为完全悲观，就不用去赌了，“不赌那会赢”？他们只能依靠机会，勉强鼓起信心，一步一步地走他们所不能预测的道路，所以他们也把这种态度叫做“改良主义”。胡适解释他们的“淑世主义”，即“改良主义”的人生观说：“世界的拯拔不是不可能的，也不是我们笼着手，抬起头来就可以望得到的。世界的拯救是可以做得到的，但是须要我们各人尽力做去。我们尽一分的力，世界的拯拔就赶早一分”（文存卷二，页一○七）。这里“世界”二字是应该读做“帝国主义世界”的。所以胡适的所谓“一点一滴的改良”其实乃是没落阶级的一种嘶喊；他们面对着决定他们死亡的客观规律，妄想用“一点一滴”的努力来改变自己的命运，用一笔一笔的赌注来赢回自己的本钱。
    胡适对偶然性的崇拜的实质就是如此。
    我们再来检查一下胡适的抹煞阶级区别的“大我”观念。
    “小我”——个人是要死灭的，而“大我”——人类是永生的，这种说法，表面上看来，好像不过是毫无意义的废话，但是胡适提出这种说法，当然不是没有特殊用意的。我们知道，在社会历史发展中，每个阶级、每个社会制度都有发生和衰亡的历史，历史上的一切剥削阶级、一切剥削制度最后一定全部死灭。科学地认识社会历史，当然不能不注意到这一点。胡适的“大我”永生的说法就是故意来模糊这个事实，从而达到资本主义制度永生的结论。
    每一时代的人民大众的劳动生产和革命斗争世世代代地相继承，推动社会历史不断地向前进步，一直到社会主义、共产主义；任何时代的任何反动势力都不能扼杀决定历史发展的根本方向的这种伟大力量，即人民群众的力量，也就不能扼杀社会历史发展的进程。——如果我们说社会永生，那只能是在这一意义上。我们的这种正确的历史观正确地解决了个人和社会的关系问题。只有同求进步的人民群众结合在一起，个人的努力才是有意义的，才能够对社会历史发展起积极的作用。这种观点是同胡适的资产阶级腐朽观点正相对立的。
    胡适使用他的含糊的，生物学的“大我”观念来使人相信，任何人的任何行为，不论善恶，都可能对社会历史起巨大影响，都可以永垂不朽。但事实并不是这样的。个人的社会活动对于整个社会的发展进程，有无影响和影响的久暂，首先决定于这种活动的性质。
    举个最简单的例子说吧。我们国家的建设事业的发展要靠每一个工人、农民、知识分子的积极的努力。每个人的劳动都是对于整个国家建设有贡献的，因此都是对于我们国家生活的发展起了作用的。如果有某一个人有意消极怠工，那固然可能对某一个车间、某一个合作社、某一单位工作的完成计划发生不利的影响，但如果这个人竟以为他个人的消极怠工能破坏整个国家建设，那是妄想。因为他的这一点破坏作用被淹没在广大人民群众的力量中，随着整个生活的向前发展而终于是会化为零的。同样的，一切违反历史发展的规律而妄图用个人和少数人的力量来对抗人民大众的力量的人，纵然一时能起某种影响，但归根结底，是一点不能改变社会历史前进的基本规律的。
    善和恶所起的影响是否像胡适所设想的那样，在社会生活中平行地向前延伸，千秋万岁地共存共荣呢？当然不是的。善和恶在社会生活中不是和平共居，而是激烈地相互斗争的。我们所说的善恶同站在帝国主义走狗立场上的胡适所说的善恶不同：违反历史发展规律，违反人民群众意志的是恶，反之是善。通过激烈的斗争，人民大众的进步的力量一定要，也一定能够抵制、征服和消灭恶的势力。同人民群众的创造历史的伟大力量比较起来，任何恶的势力都是极端渺小的，它想把它的影响永远保存在社会历史生活中是绝对办不到的。
    胡适用反科学的论断来煽动反对人民革命的罪恶行为，宣布这一切都能在实际生活中永垂不朽，这不过是他的愚蠢的疯狂的幻想罢了。
    事实很明白。难道卖国贼蒋介石和他手下的那一小撮包括胡适在内的匪帮能够和中国劳动人民在一起，在同一个“大我”中永垂不朽么？
    当然不是的。
    这一小撮卖国贼的破坏活动固然至今对我国生活的发展还在起着某些影响，但是中国人民将彻底消灭这些卖国贼的活动，并使他们的破坏活动的影响无论在实际生活和在精神生活中最后连一点痕迹也看不见，这是一定的。
    而我们的每一个普通的工人和农民为我们的祖国所作的每一件工作都是永远向前进步发展的伟大的人民事业中的一个部分，因此那就都是真正光荣的和真正不朽的。
