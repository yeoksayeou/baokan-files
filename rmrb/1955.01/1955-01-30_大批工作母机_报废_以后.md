	After a Large Number of Machine Tools Were "Scrapped"

To the Editor:

	The leadership of the 342 Exploration Team of the Chemical Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry blindly discarded old equipment and purchased new machines, causing serious losses to the country.

	In 1953, when the 342 Exploration Team was working in Shandong, it had a lot of machinery and equipment. There were more than 20 various machine tools, such as gantry planers, shapers, and drilling machines. If these machines were carefully maintained, they could fully meet the needs of production. However, when the exploration team was transferred from Shandong to Anhui, Liu Wanxing, the head of the Mechanical and Electrical Section, put forward the slogan of "eliminate old-fashioned belt lathes - rather not use machines than take old-fashioned machines." At that time, the workers had many opinions and were reluctant to discard these usable machines. Worker Kang Zude requested to take a press with them, and the workers in the riveter group also unanimously requested to take a roller machine, but Liu Wanxing said: "Rather hammer by hand than take these old machines," "If we need them in the future, can't the higher authorities buy us new ones?" and criticized the workers for being "ideologically backward" and "not keeping up with the situation." In this way, more than a dozen kinds of old machine tools were thrown into dilapidated houses and thatched clumps. Many of them were very useful machines, and some could be used after repair (a gantry planer they scrapped was later transferred to Jilin Engineering Company for repair and became a very good machine tool).

	After they "scrapped" a large number of machine tools, they blindly asked the state last year for one each of six-foot, eight-foot, and twelve-foot precision all-gear motor lathes and twenty-foot Czechoslovakian imported heavy-duty universal lathes, as well as planing machines, drilling machines, grinding machines, and other mechanical and electrical equipment. According to the work tasks, it was possible not to purchase so many new machines last year. Zhao Xiwu, the head of the repair and fitting section, said: "If we bring the discarded eight-foot and twelve-foot lathes to Anhui and repair them, then there is no need to buy new lathes." The fact is also true. For example, a newly purchased Czech-style twenty-foot heavy-duty universal lathe was left in the open for more than three months without even removing the shell, with no work to do. The value of this lathe could buy seven or eight ordinary precision all-gear motor lathes. Two sets of transformers and one set of power distribution equipment, which cost more than ten billion yuan, have also been sleeping in the open since they were transported to the construction site in May last year.

	The erroneous ideological style of the team's leaders has seriously affected the progress of production. After we arrived in Anhui, because the riveter group's equipment was not brought in full and the new equipment had not arrived, the workers had to swing sledgehammers all day long, using backward manual operations to replace machines to make parts and cut materials. Cutting long pipes into sections for processing delayed production and caused losses to state property.

	Liu Wanxing's erroneous ideological style is inseparable from the connivance of the higher-level leading organs and their ignorance of the existing equipment and blind approval of plans. We workers request the relevant supervisory departments to inspect this matter and help them improve their work.

### 大批工作母机“报废”以后

    大批工作母机“报废”以后编辑同志：
    重工业部化学工业管理局三四二勘探队的某些领导人员盲目丢弃旧设备和添置新机器，给国家造成了严重的损失。
    三四二勘探队一九五三年在山东工作时，机器设备很多，仅龙门刨床、牛头刨床、钻床等各种工作母机，就有二十多台。这些机器如果加以细心护理，是完全可以满足生产上的需要的。可是当勘探队从山东调往安徽工作时，机电科科长刘万兴提出
  “消灭旧式皮带车床——宁可不用机器，也不带走旧式机器”的口号。当时工人们意见纷纷，舍不得把这些可用的机器丢弃。工人康祖德要求把一台压力机带走，铆工组的工人也一致要求把辊床带上，刘万兴却说：“宁肯用手捶，也不要这些旧机器”，
  “将来要用，上级不能为我们买新的吗？”并斥责工人们“思想落后”、“跟不上形势”。这样，各种旧的工作母机就有十多台被扔在破屋和茅草丛中了。其中不少都是很好用的机器，有的只要经过修理就能使用（他们报废的一台龙门刨床，后来调到吉林工程公司修理后，成为一台很好的工作母机）。
    他们把大批工作母机“报废”后，去年却盲目地向国家要六呎、八呎、十二呎精密全齿马达车床和二十呎捷克斯洛伐克进口的重型万能车床各一部，要刨床、钻床、砂轮机等机电设备。根据工作任务来看，去年是可以不购买这么多新机器的。修配工段长赵希伍说：“如果把扔掉的八尺和十二尺两台车床带到安徽来修理一下，那就用不着购买新车床了。”事实也正是这样，例如一台新买来的捷克式的二十尺重型万能车床，连壳子板都没有拆，就在露天放了三个多月，无活可做。这台车床的价值能买普通精密全齿马达车床七、八部。花了十多亿元买的两套变压器和一套配电设备，从去年五月份运到工地后，也是一直让它在露天睡觉。
    队的领导人员这种错误思想作风，严重地影响了生产的进行。我们到安徽以后，由于铆工组的设备没有带齐全，新的设备又没有来，工人只好成天抡大锤，用落后的手工操作代替机器制作零件和截料。把长管子截成一节节地加工，耽误了生产，也造成了国家财产的损失。
    刘万兴这种错误的思想作风是和上级领导机关的放纵和对现有设备心中无数、盲目批准计划分不开的，我们工人要求有关监察部门，对这件事进行检查，帮助他们改进工作。　李勇
