Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 6th: The Ngo Dinh Diem clique, with the connivance of the French Federal Forces, continues to retaliate against and persecute the people of South Vietnam, suppressing the people's democratic rights. According to incomplete statistics, from the ceasefire to the end of November 1954, approximately four months, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique carried out 439 acts of terror and retaliation and acts of massacre. 127 people were killed, 588 injured, and 3,172 arrested.

To cover up their crimes, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique made various denials. For example, in the Me Ki, Vinh Xuan, and Pingcheng incidents, after the Ngo Dinh Diem clique used fully armed troops to fire on residents, they insisted that the residents were staging armed demonstrations against the army. In some incidents, after they killed civilians, they tied the bodies to stones and threw them into the river to eliminate all evidence.

The Ngo Dinh Diem clique also sent troops to search for young people everywhere, forcibly conscripting them into Bao Dai's army, and organized so-called "security" forces in the countryside, using them to carry out terrorist activities.

The Ngo Dinh Diem clique barbarously suppressed the peace movement in Saigon-Cholon, arrested more than 30 intellectuals and prominent figures, suppressed freedom of speech, and closed ten newspapers in Saigon.

These actions are completely incompatible with Articles 14 and 15 of the Geneva Accords, which stipulate the democratic rights of residents.

In a memorandum sent to the French Federal Forces side, the delegation of the Vietnamese People's Army to the Joint Armistice Commission in South Vietnam pointed out that these actions are part of a conspiracy by the American imperialists, the French colonial elements who are sabotaging the armistice agreement, and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, with the aim of persecuting and intimidating those who love peace and agree with national independence and unity, undermining the Geneva Accords, and turning South Vietnam into a military base for the American imperialists. The Vietnamese People's Army delegation demanded that the command of the French Federal Forces in South Vietnam order its subordinate units and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to resolutely stop all acts of terror and persecution against residents, release all those still detained, and severely punish the criminals.

    吴庭艳集团四个月中制造四百起迫害事件
    越人民军代表团要法方断然制止迫害行为
    【新华社八日讯】据越南通讯社河内六日讯：吴庭艳集团在法兰西联邦部队的纵容下，不断对南越人民进行报复迫害，压制人民的民主权利。据不完全的统计，从停战到一九五四年十一月底约四个月中，吴庭艳集团进行了四百三十九件恐怖报复行为和残杀行为。有一百二十七人被杀，五百八十八人受伤，三千一百七十二人被捕。
    吴庭艳集团为了掩盖他们的罪行，作了种种抵赖。例如，在楳棋、永春和平成事件中，吴庭艳集团在使用全副武装的军队对居民开火后，反而硬说居民们进行武装示威来反对军队。在有些事件中，他们杀害老百姓后，把尸体同石头绑在一起扔到河里去，以便消灭一切罪证。
    吴庭艳集团还派军队到处搜索青年，把他们强征入保大军队，在乡间组织所谓“保安”部队，利用他们进行恐怖活动。
    吴庭艳集团野蛮地镇压西贡—堤岸的和平运动，逮捕了三十多个知识分子和著名人士，压制言论自由，并且封闭了西贡的十家报馆。
    这些行为是和日内瓦协定中规定居民民主权利的第十四、十五条完全不相容的。
    越南人民军驻南越联合停战委员会代表团在送给法兰西联邦部队方面的备忘录中指出：这些行为是美帝国主义者、破坏停战协定的法国殖民分子和吴庭艳集团的阴谋的一部分，其目的在于迫害和恫吓那些爱好和平和赞同民族独立和统一的人，破坏日内瓦协定，并且把南越变成美帝国主义者的军事基地。越南人民军代表团要求南越的法兰西联邦部队司令部命令所属部队和吴庭艳集团断然制止对居民所进行的一切恐怖和迫害行为，释放一切仍被拘禁的人，严厉惩办罪犯。
