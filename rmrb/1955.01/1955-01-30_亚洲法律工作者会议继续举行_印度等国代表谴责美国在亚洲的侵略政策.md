Xinhua News Agency, Calcutta, January 29th: S.K. Acharya, General Secretary of the All-India Democratic Lawyers Association, strongly condemned the US aggressive policy of organizing war blocs and interfering in the internal affairs of other countries in Asia at the Asian Jurists' Conference on the 28th.

In his speech, Acharya pointed out that the Manila Treaty, the US-Chiang Treaty, and other aggressive treaties manufactured by the United States have nothing in common with the United Nations Charter.

Acharya then exposed the US plot to invade China's territory of Taiwan. He said that the occupation of Taiwan by US troops is a very serious interference in China's sovereignty, because the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation had already declared Taiwan as part of Chinese territory during and after World War II. Acharya also pointed out that the devastation of Burmese territory by Chiang Kai-shek's troops, the US "embargo" policy against China, and the maintenance of foreign possessions in India are all interferences in the sovereignty of Asian countries.

Acharya called on Asian jurists to explain to the people the serious violations of the UN Charter by the imperialists and to promote the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

Tetsuhiko Tozawa, Dean of the Faculty of Law of Nagoya University in Japan and a member of the World Peace Council, welcomed the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in his speech. He said: "These five principles are the true factors that constitute a truly international peaceful society." Regarding the relationship between Japan and the United States, Tozawa Tetsuhiko said that the United States does not respect Japan's territorial integrity and sovereignty at all. He said that according to the US-Japan "Security Treaty," the United States has the right to station troops on and near Japanese territory. The trade relationship between the United States and Japan is also detrimental to Japan's interests. Since Japan has become the largest military and supply base for the United States, this seriously threatens the independence and security of Asian countries and peoples. Tozawa Tetsuhiko also accused the United States of trying its best to obstruct the establishment of commercial and diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union and China.

Tozawa Tetsuhiko finally said that the Japanese people will never be deceived by American propaganda. For the sake of Asian peace and their own interests, the Japanese people are defenders of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Tozawa Tetsuhiko proposed the establishment of an all-Asian security system including all Asian countries and peoples to guarantee peace in all of Asia, and to strive to establish the principle that no military bases and military installations may be established outside one's own country.

Representatives and observers from Australia, Burma, Ceylon, Egypt and New Zealand also spoke at the meeting on the 28th. They talked about issues such as civil liberties, the status of women, and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction.

    亚洲法律工作者会议继续举行
    印度等国代表谴责美国在亚洲的侵略政策
    【新华社加尔各答二十九日电】　全印民主法律工作者协会总书记斯·克·阿查雅二十八日在亚洲法律工作者会议上强烈谴责美国在亚洲组织战争集团、干涉别国内政的侵略政策。
    阿查雅在发言中指出，马尼拉条约、美蒋条约以及美国制造的其他侵略性条约，都是同联合国宪章毫无共同之处的。
    阿查雅接着揭露了美国侵略中国领土台湾的阴谋。他说，美国军队侵占台湾是对中国主权的极严重的干涉，因为早在第二次大战期间和大战以后，开罗宣言和波茨坦公告就已宣布台湾为中国领土的一部分。阿查雅还指出，蒋介石军队对缅甸领土的蹂躏、美国对中国实施的“禁运”政策和外国在印度属地的保持，都是对亚洲国家主权的干涉。
    阿查雅要求亚洲法律工作者在人民中说明帝国主义者对联合国宪章的严重破坏，并宣传和平共处的五项原则。
    日本名古屋大学法学部长、世界和平理事会理事户泽铁彦在发言中欢迎和平共处的五项原则。他说：“这五项原则就是构成名副其实的国际和平社会的真正因素。”户泽铁彦谈到日本和美国的关系说，美国对日本的领土完整和主权一点也不尊重。他说，根据美日“安全条约”，美国有权在日本领土上和领土附近驻军。美国和日本的贸易关系也是损害日本的利益的。由于日本已成为美国最大的军事和供应基地，这就严重地威胁了亚洲国家和人民的独立和安全。户泽铁彦并指责美国竭力阻挠日本同苏联、中国建立商务和外交关系。
    户泽铁彦最后说，日本人民决不会受美国宣传的欺骗。为了亚洲和平和自己的利益，日本人民是和平共处五项原则的保卫者。户泽铁彦提议建立一个包括一切亚洲国家和人民在内的全亚洲安全体系，以保障全亚洲的和平，并努力确立在本国以外不得建立军事基地和军事设备的原则。
    在二十八日会议上发言的还有澳大利亚、缅甸、锡兰、埃及和新西兰等国的代表和观察员。他们分别谈到了公民自由、妇女地位、禁止大规模毁灭性武器等问题。
