To the Editor:

　　In the past two or three months, we have generally found cases of farmers castrating and slaughtering sows and piglets in our county. In Qingkouyuan Village, Chuanshan Township, Xianju County, more than 50 households raised sows, and more than a dozen were castrated in one day. In Liqiao Village, Baoguo Township, Xinchang County, there were only more than 40 sows in total, and 30 have already been castrated and slaughtered. The reason why farmers castrate and slaughter sows and piglets is said to be that the price of piglets is too low, sales are sluggish, and there is insufficient pig feed, so there is not much benefit to raising them.

　　In fact, the benefits of raising pigs are great. Because pig manure is a very good fertilizer, as the saying goes: "Raising pigs doesn't make money, but look back at the fields." This shows that raising pigs well can increase production.

　　If the castration and slaughter of sows continues, it will not only cause losses to farmers' production, but also affect the meat needs of the general public. We hope that relevant departments will find ways to supply wheat bran, rice bran, and powder dregs to farmers for feeding pigs, and reasonably adjust the price and solve the sales problems of piglets. At the same time, we should help farmers develop feed sources and educate farmers to use pigweed, corn cobs, sweet potato leaves, sweet potato vines, and other substitutes to feed pigs, and not rely entirely on rice bran and wheat bran. In short, as long as we actively find solutions, pigs can be fed well and grow big.

    帮助农民解决猪的饲料编辑同志：
    近两三个月来，我们县里普遍发现了农民阉割、宰杀母猪和小猪的情况。仙居县船山乡清口园村五十多户养母猪的，一天就阉割了十多只；新昌县报国乡里桥村一共只有四十多头母猪，已阉宰的竟有三十头。农民阉宰母猪和小猪的原因，据说是由于小猪价格太低、销路不旺，猪的饲料不足，养起来没有多大好处。
    其实养猪的好处是很大的。因为猪粪是一种很好的肥料，俗语说：养猪不赚钱，回头看看田。这就说明养好了猪就能增加生产。
    如果阉宰母猪的情况继续下去，不仅使农民的生产受到损失，对广大人民的肉食需要也有影响，希望有关部门设法供应麸皮、米糠、粉渣等给农民喂猪，合理调整小猪价格和解决销路问题。同时应该帮助农民开辟饲料来源，教育农民采用猪草、玉米心子、蕃薯叶、蕃薯藤等代食品来喂猪，不要完全依靠米糠、麸皮。总之，只要积极想办法，猪是可以喂得好、喂得大的。
