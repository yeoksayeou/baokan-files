Xinhua News Agency, London: According to a report from the diplomatic correspondent of the British News Agency, the counselor of the Soviet Embassy in London visited the British Foreign Office on the 14th to inquire when Britain intends to complete the ratification procedures for the Paris Agreements.

It is reported that Geoffrey Harrison, the British Assistant Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, who received the representative of the Soviet Embassy, said: After the Paris Agreements are passed by both houses of Parliament, they can be considered effective as soon as the Queen signs the instrument of ratification and the instrument of ratification is handed over to a participating country for safekeeping.

As for the deadline for finally completing the ratification procedures for the Paris Agreements, according to press sources, Harrison said that this issue depends on and takes into account the political situation, but in any case, a decision will not be made until France submits its instrument of ratification.

    苏驻英使馆参赞访英外交部
    询问英国批准巴黎协定的日期
    【新华社讯】据塔斯社伦敦讯：据英国新闻联合社外交记者报道，苏联驻伦敦大使馆参赞在十四日访问了英国外交部，打听英国打算在什么时候完成巴黎协定的批准手续。
    据悉，接见苏联大使馆代表的英国助理外交次官乔弗雷·哈里逊说：巴黎协定在获得议会两院通过之后，只要经过女王在批准书上签字，并且把批准书交给一个参加协定的国家保存，就可以认为已经生效。
    至于最后完成批准巴黎协定手续的期限，据新闻界人士说，哈里逊说这个问题要取决于并且考虑到政治情况，但是无论如何要等到法国交出批准书之后才作决定。
