To prepare for the widespread promotion of double-share plows, Shaanxi Province has already transported 880 double-wheeled double-share plows from the Northeast. This batch of double-wheeled double-share plows will be distributed to agricultural technology promotion stations, animal-drawn farm implement stations, tractor stations, and farms to conduct typical demonstrations, paving the way for the promotion of 8,500 double-wheeled double-share plows in the vast rural areas of the province this year.

Currently, this batch of double-wheeled double-share plows is being transferred to various locations. The Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry has already requested that cadres from relevant agricultural technology promotion stations learn the technology of using and installing double-wheeled double-share plows before the spring plowing season. This year, Shaanxi Province also plans to establish a farm implement repair and fitting station in each of the Weinan, Baoji, Yan'an, and Hanzhong special districts.

    为普遍推广双铧犁作准备
    陕西省已经从东北运到八百八十多部双轮双铧犁。这批双轮双铧犁，将分配给农业技术推广站、马拉农具站、拖拉机站和农场等单位，进行典型示范，为今年在全省广大农村中推广八千五百部双轮双铧犁开辟道路。
    目前，这批双轮双铧犁正在向各地调运。陕西省农林厅已经要求有关农业技术推广站的干部，在春耕以前要学会使用和安装双轮双铧犁的技术。今年，陕西省还准备在渭南、宝鸡、延安、汉中等专区各建立一处农具修配站。　（本报陕西记者站）
