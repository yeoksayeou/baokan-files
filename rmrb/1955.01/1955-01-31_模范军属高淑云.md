    A old woman was walking laboriously on the dike. The rain was heavy, and the wind sent waves of the river crashing against the dike, occasionally splashing a spray of water that landed on the old woman. She wasn't wearing a straw hat or holding an umbrella; the rain streamed down her gray hair, and her clothes were soaked. The thick mud on the dike reached her knees, and she leaned on a stick, cautiously placing her right foot down, then slowly lifting her left, moving forward step by step.
    Since the start of flood control, this old woman had been constantly running back and forth on the dike. Now she was going to the cooperative, four or five miles away, to buy cigarettes for the laborers. The old woman made these trips several times a day. When she returned with the cigarettes, she would hold up a megaphone and shout, "I don't want to run errands for nothing. If you feel bad about it, each of you carry three more loads of earth every day!"
    "Okay, Grandma Gao, we'll listen to you," the laborers said happily.
    Grandma Gao's name is Gao Shuyun, and she is a model propagandist in Xishui County. Until two years ago, she made a living selling fried dough sticks. "But," Grandma Gao said with a smile, "even if you bought one of my fried dough sticks, you'd have to listen to me preach a few words." Thus, being a Party propagandist became Grandma Gao's main occupation.
    When flood control started last year, Grandma Gao went to the dike. Every day, as soon as it dawned, her voice would carry from the megaphone: "Get up! Folks, carry thirty loads, then eat break—fast."
    When the laborers were eating lunch, Grandma Gao's voice would come again: "The beds are all made for you, sleep a—while, then carry fifty more loads."
    Grandma Gao carried earth just like the young people, each load weighing a hundred catties. Such a heavy load was too much for her body to bear. Many people worriedly asked her to rest, but she always smiled indifferently, "Rest? Don't you see the floodwaters are still rising?" One night, a sudden rainstorm struck, and the newly heightened dike was eroded by the river waves. Grandma Gao got up, grabbed a bundle of rice straw and branches, and ran into the wind and rain. Behind her, a large group of people immediately followed. When she reached the riverbank, Grandma Gao jumped into the water, using her body to block the waves.
    Last year's flood control struggle lasted for four months. In this tense and arduous life, who could believe that Grandma Gao was a sixty-five-year-old woman?
    Grandma Gao has been defying her age in recent years. But almost forty years ago, when Grandma Gao was only in her twenties, she had worriedly made preparations for her old age: she had made a pair of small gold earrings and kept them close to her. In the past forty years, Grandma Gao has experienced so many painful days! Her first husband was killed by the Kuomintang reactionaries for participating in the land revolution. In the year the War of Resistance Against Japan began, her second husband was killed by Japanese planes. Grandma Gao began a life of displacement with her two children. She worked as a helper for others, sold fried dough sticks, and even begged for six or seven years. Many times, when she saw her two children freezing and starving, she took out the pair of gold earrings. A mother's heart drove her: take them and sell them! But she immediately thought: the hard days are still long, and they cannot be sold unless absolutely necessary.
    One day last year, Grandma Gao thought of the pair of gold earrings again. She took out the small golden things, caressing them in her hand. Forty years, how could she not feel the pain? But she finally stood up and took the gold earrings to the bank.
    The bank gave Grandma Gao 135,000 yuan. She added the remaining military dependent model award money that the government had given her some time ago and bought 250,000 yuan of government bonds.
    The news of Grandma Gao selling her earrings to buy government bonds spread quickly. Someone asked her:
      "Aren't you worried about your old age now?"
    "Well, I don't think about that problem now!" Grandma Gao replied.
    Grandma Gao's eldest son joined the People's Liberation Army as early as 1949. In 1952, Grandma Gao's second son turned eighteen. One day, she called her son to her side and said, "Son, I want you to join the army and resist America and aid Korea, what do you think?" Fearing that her son would disagree, she added, "In the future, it will be socialism, all your good days, to defend the motherland." The son agreed.
    Considering that Grandma Gao was already very old, and she needed a son to take care of her, the district office did not allow her son to go. In the end, Grandma Gao went directly to the district head and said angrily, "These years, tell me, what do I need people to take care of?"
    The district head was stumped by Grandma Gao's question. Yes! Although Grandma Gao was a military dependent, she did not want others to take care of her. She never asked the government for relief, and even the relief money that the government gave her each time based on mass reviews, she had to say it again and again, send it again and again, before she was willing to accept it. In 1952, Grandma Gao was successively named a special-class military dependent model in Xishui County and Hubei Province, and received a bonus of 400,000 yuan. She deposited the money in the bank, and if any military dependent urgently needed money, she would take a portion from the bank and lend it to them. A military dependent named Wang Zhongde fell ill, and Grandma Gao took care of him every day, running five times in one day just to ask for a doctor. Grandma Gao led the masses to send manure to the countryside for military dependents every year, and sometimes even helped military dependents fight drought and eliminate insects. On the street, Grandma Gao organized the masses to help each other in production, organized theatrical troupes.... She runs around outside every day, just like a young person!
    Grandma Gao's second son finally joined the army.
    In February last year, Grandma Gao participated in the Chinese People's Delegation to Comfort the People's Liberation Army and went to the South China Sea defense line to offer comfort. For more than sixty years, this was the first time she had traveled so far! She saw factories and railways, listened to many important reports, and also gave reports to many people. The leaders of the People's Liberation Army shook her hand and talked to her kindly, the commanders and soldiers lifted her up, put flowers in her chest, and called her "dear mother." In Guangzhou, Grandma Gao also met her eldest son, who was serving in an air force unit. She stroked her son's hands, and couldn't help but think of the events of decades ago: at that time, her husband, who participated in the land revolution, struggled so hard! Some things could not even be told to Grandma Gao. Only once, at night, her husband secretly showed her a thing with a red five-pointed star. It was this red five-pointed star that now shone brightly on her son's hat, shining brightly on the hats of thousands of people.

    模范军属高淑云
    姚里军
    一个老婆婆在堤上艰难地走着。雨下得很大，风卷送着江浪扑打着堤身，不时地掀起一阵水花，溅在老婆婆的身上。她没戴斗笠，也没有打伞，雨水顺着她的灰白色的头发往下流，衣服都湿透了。堤上的稀泥埋到人的膝下，她拄着一根棍子，谨慎地踩下右脚，再慢慢地提起左脚，一步一步地向前移动。
    从防汛以来，这位老婆婆就一直在堤上奔走。这会儿她又到四五里地以外的合作社替民工们买纸烟去了。老婆婆每天总要跑这么几趟。买烟回来，老婆婆就举着广播筒喊道：“我也不愿意白跑腿，你们要是过意不去的话，就每人每天多挑三担土吧！”
    “好啊，高婆婆，我们听您的。”民工们高兴地说。
    高婆婆名叫高淑云，是浠水县的模范宣传员。直到前年，她还靠卖油条过活，“只是，”高婆婆笑着说：“那怕买我一根油条，少不得也要听我宣传几句。”因此，党的宣传员倒成了高婆婆的主要职业了。
    去年防汛一开始，高婆婆就上了堤。每天，天刚亮，她的声音就由广播筒传开了：“起来啦！老乡们，挑三—十—担，吃早—饭。”
    民工们吃午饭的时候，又传来了高婆婆的声音：“床铺都给你们理好了，睡一—下，再挑五—十—担。”
    高婆婆也和年轻人一样挑土，一挑就是一百斤。这么重的担子，压得她身体吃不住。许多人关心地要她休息，她总是不在意地笑笑：“休息？你没看见洪水还在往上涨吗？”一天夜晚，暴风雨突然袭来，刚刚加高的堤身被江浪打得刷刷直掉土。高婆婆起来了，她抱起一捆稻草和树枝就向风雨里跑去，在她的后面，马上随来了一大批人。到了江边，高婆婆跳下了水，用身体挡住了风浪。
    去年的防汛斗争继续了四个月，在这紧张而又艰苦的生活里，谁能相信高婆婆是一个六十五岁的老人呢？
    高婆婆这几年是不服老了。但是，差不多四十年以前，就在高婆婆才二十多岁的时候，她倒曾经耽心地给自己作过防老的准备：她打了一付小小的金耳环，贴身收藏着。四十年来，高婆婆经历了多少痛苦的日子啊！她的第一个丈夫因为参加土地革命被国民党反动派杀害了。抗战开始的那年，她的第二个丈夫又被日本飞机炸死了。高婆婆带着两个孩子开始了颠沛流浪的生活。她给人帮工，卖油条，还讨过六、七年的饭。多少次，当她看见两个孩子冻饿得难耐的时候，她掏出了这付金耳环，一种作母亲的心驱使着她：拿去变卖了吧！但是她马上又想到：苦日子还长得很呢，不到绝路，是不能变卖的。
    去年的一天，高婆婆又想起了这付金耳环。她取出这个黄澄澄的小东西，放在手心里抚弄着，四十年了啊，怎能不心疼呢？但是，她终于站起来带着金耳环到银行去了。
    银行给了高婆婆十三万五千元。她添上还剩下的政府前些时候发给她的军属模范奖金，买了二十五万元的公债。
    高婆婆卖耳环买公债的事，马上传开了。有人问她：
      “您现在不想防老了吗？”
    “唔，现在倒想不到这个问题啦！”高婆婆回答。
    高婆婆的大儿子早在一九四九年参加了人民解放军。一九五二年，高婆婆的第二个儿子长到十八岁了。一天，她把儿子叫到跟前说：“伢呀，娘有意要你参军抗美援朝去，你看怎样？”怕儿子不同意，她又补上一句：“往后是社会主义，都是你的好日子，要保卫祖国。”儿子答应了。
    因为考虑到高婆婆年纪已经很大，不能不留个儿子在身边照顾，区公所不让她的儿子去。最后，高婆婆直接找到了区长，气呼呼地说：“这几年，你说，我要人照顾什么？”
    区长被高婆婆问住了。是啊！高婆婆虽然是军属，却不愿意别人来照顾她。她从不向政府请求救济，甚至连政府每次根据群众评议发给她的救济金，也要说了又说，送了又送，她才肯收下。一九五二年，高婆婆先后被评为浠水县和湖北省的特等军属模范，得了四十万元的奖金。她把这笔钱存在银行里，有哪个军属急等钱用，她就从银行里取一部分借给他。一个名叫王忠德的军属病了，高婆婆每天去照料他，光是请医生，有一天就跑了五趟。高婆婆带动群众每年替军属送粪下乡，有时候，还帮军属抗旱除虫。在街道上，高婆婆组织群众互助生产，组织剧团……。她每天在外面跑来跑去，简直就像个年轻人一样啊！
    高婆婆的第二个儿子终于又参了军。
    去年二月间，高婆婆参加了中国人民慰问人民解放军代表团到华南海防线上去慰问。六十多年来，这还是第一次出远门呢！她看见了工厂和铁路，听了不少次重要的报告，也向许多人做了报告。解放军的首长和她握手、亲切地谈话，指战员们把她抬了起来，把鲜花塞到她的胸前，喊她“亲爱的妈妈”。在广州，高婆婆还和在空军某部服务的大儿子见了面。她抚摸着儿子的双手，不由地想起了几十年前的事：那时候，她的参加土地革命的丈夫，斗争是多么艰难啊！有些话甚至对高婆婆也不能讲，只有一次，还是晚上，她的丈夫曾把一颗红五星的东西偷偷给她看了一下。正是这颗红五星，现在闪亮在自己儿子的帽子上，闪亮在千千万万人的帽子上了。
