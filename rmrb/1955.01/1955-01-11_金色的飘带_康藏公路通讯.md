“Golden Ribbon”
— Correspondence from the Kangzang Highway
By our correspondent Shen Shi

The Tibetan people call the Kangzang Highway the "Rainbow of Immortals" and the "Golden Bridge." At the construction site on the banks of the Niyang River, they once sang this song:

	Golden ribbon,
	Floating from Beijing to Tibet,
	Floating across forests and pastures,
	Floating across mountains and valleys,
	Floating across our hometown,
	It will bring us happiness.

For this "golden ribbon" that runs across the Kangzang Plateau, countless Tibetan men and women, on the transportation lines, drove yaks, mules, and horses to transport materials to the construction site. To allow the "golden ribbon" to quickly reach Lhasa, tens of thousands of Tibetan laborers, carrying tents, furniture, butter, and highland barley flour, came one after another from the northern Tibetan grasslands, the Yarlung Zangbo River basin, and the northern foothills of the Himalayas to the construction sites of the Lhasa River, Minla, and Niyang River. Together with the commanders and soldiers of a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army, they built this section of the highway, which is more than 300 kilometers long.

The construction site was filled with an atmosphere of national unity. The "golden ribbon" closely connected the Tibetan laborers and soldiers. They were as united as relatives. When the laborers first arrived at the construction site, the soldiers took care of them in every way, putting up their tents, picking up firewood, and carrying water. When the laborers didn't know how to build roads, the soldiers patiently taught them. In dangerous areas, the soldiers carried out the construction work, preventing the laborers from going up. Those Tibetan compatriots who came from the border areas and had never been in contact with the People's Liberation Army experienced warmth at the construction site and realized that the People's Liberation Army was their own army. They sang at evening gatherings to express their joy:

	The shovels were forged by you,
	The picks were polished by you,
	People's Liberation Army! You teach us to build roads,
	Like a master teaching a skill to an apprentice.

Yin Xiangyao, the deputy squad leader of the 1st Platoon of a certain battalion, and soldier Yin Zhengyuan built roads together with the laborers from Qushui Zong. It was the rainy season at that time, and the laborers slept on the grass. Some fell ill, including Jiayang, who led the laborers. Yin Zhengyuan thought: the grassland is too damp, and this will affect the construction. He built several beds out of branches for the laborers to sleep on. At first, the laborers were unwilling, but Yin Zhengyuan spoke with Jiayang. Jiayang slept on the bed for a few nights and felt very comfortable. He told the laborers about the benefits of sleeping on the bed, and they began to sleep on the beds. After hearing about it, laborers from each Zong came to visit, and the beds were gradually promoted to the barracks of each Zong.

The laborers from Qushui Zong moved to Langga and pitched their tents on a sandbar surrounded by water. On the side near the construction site, the water was relatively narrow, and they built a pontoon bridge to connect to the construction site. One night, a mountain torrent broke out, and by dawn, the water was about to flood the tents. When Yin Zhengyuan saw this, he said to Yin Xiangyao, "Deputy squad leader! We have to find a way to get the laborers to the other side."

"The pontoon bridge has been washed away, we have to rebuild it," Yin Xiangyao said.

They saw two large trees on the sandbar and felled them, which happened to reach the other shore. However, the current was very rapid, and people swayed from side to side while walking on the tree trunks, making it impossible for the Tibetan women to cross. The two jumped into the water and held the tree trunks with their hands, so that all the people and supplies could cross to the other side. They were soaked in the water for several hours, and their skin turned purple from the cold. The laborers were so moved that they shed tears. At an evening gathering, they sang:

	No matter how many Hadas there are!
	None are as pure white!
	No matter how many friends there are!
	None are as close as the People's Liberation Army!

The soldiers of the 2nd Platoon of a certain company and the laborers from Longzi Zong were building roads near Apa. This area was next to the steep slope of the Niyang River, and the soil was hard, so the laborers' work efficiency was very low. When platoon leader Li Guodong saw this, he thought: if this continues, it will not only affect the laborers' income but also prolong the construction period. How can we improve efficiency? He thought about it left and right but couldn't come up with a good solution. One day, he discovered a large spring on the mountain and said to the soldiers, "If we divert that spring to the construction site and let the water wash away the mud, the work efficiency will definitely improve." The soldiers all said that this was a good idea. They dug a ditch along the hillside and diverted the water to the construction site. The soil was easily dug after being washed by the water, and the work efficiency was significantly improved. At an evening gathering, the men and women laborers and soldiers danced and sang to their hearts' content. They presented Hadas to the soldiers, and the soldiers' heads and shoulders were covered with Hadas.

During the construction period, Wang Guangming, a soldier of a certain company, became close friends with the laborers of Lakang Zong. The company decided to transfer Wang Guangming to Jiaza Zong. When the laborers of Lakang Zong learned of this, they took Hadas and ran to the company headquarters. They met the company commander and firmly refused to let Wang Guangming leave. The company commander comforted them properly and said to them, "Although Wang Guangming is transferred away, we will send someone else."

Soldier Zhao Guanghua took over Wang Guangming's work. After some time, he also established a deep friendship with the laborers of Lakang Zong. When the laborers' construction period expired and they were preparing to return to their hometowns, they surrounded Zhao Guanghua. Some held his hand and said kindly, "Comrade! Come with us to our hometown and take a look! Stay there for a few days and let the people in our hometown get to know the People's Liberation Army! When you return, we will definitely prepare horses and send you off personally!" Zhao Guanghua politely declined them and comforted them, saying, "If I have the opportunity to go to Lakang Zong in the future, I will definitely come to see you." When they left, the laborers couldn't help but shed tears.

From Lhasa to Bahe, many men and women laborers made contributions to road construction. At a celebration meeting held in Lumaling, a female laborer took off her medal of honor and pinned it on a soldier's chest. She patted the soldier on the shoulder and said with emotion, "You helped us build roads and taught us how to build roads. You don't accept the gifts we give you. I will give you this flower of merit to express my gratitude." At the meeting, an old man from Xueba Liekong happily sang. He sang:

	Good people are as beautiful as fairies,
	Good horses are as fast as the wind,
	Our beloved People's Liberation Army!
	Get on your horses!
	On that vast wilderness,
	Ride to your heart's content!

After five years, the "golden ribbon" has floated from Ya'an to Lhasa. Trucks loaded with materials are running back and forth on the highway. The "golden ribbon" closely connects the border areas of the motherland with Beijing. The future Kangzang Plateau is just like the Tibetan laborers sang on the construction site: "Picks will dig out flowers of happiness, shovels will shovel out beautiful homes."

    “金色的飘带”
    ——康藏公路通讯
    本报记者  沈石
    西藏人民把康藏公路叫做“仙虹”、“金桥”。在尼洋河边的工地上，他们曾唱过一首这样的歌：
    金色的飘带，
    从北京飘到西藏，
    飘过森林牧场，
    飘过高山河谷，
    飘过我们的家乡，
    它将给我们带来幸福。
    为了这条横贯康藏高原的“金色的飘带”，多少藏族男女，在运输线上，赶着牦牛、骡、马，将物资运到工地，为了让“金色的飘带”迅速地飘到拉萨，成千上万的藏族民工，带上帐篷、家具、酥油和青稞面等，从藏北草原、雅鲁藏布江流域、喜马拉雅山北麓，先后来到拉萨河，敏拉和尼洋河的工地。他们和人民解放军某团的指挥员和战士们在一起，修筑这段三百多公里的公路线。
    工地里洋溢着民族友爱的气氛，“金色的飘带”将藏族民工和战士紧密地联系起来。他们团结得像亲人一样，民工刚到工地，战士们处处关心他们，给他们撑帐篷，给他们拾柴挑水，民工不会筑路，战士们耐心地教他们，在危险的地段，战士们去施工，不让民工上去。那些从国境上来的、从来没有接触过解放军的藏胞，在工地里尝到了温暖，体会到解放军是自己的队伍。他们在晚会上歌唱，来表达自己快慰的心情：
    铁锹是你们打就的，
    洋镐是你们擦亮的，
    解放军啊！你们教我们筑路，
    像师傅教给徒弟的手艺一样。
    某营一连的副班长殷相尧、战士尹正远和曲水宗的民工在一起修路，那时正值雨季，民工都睡在草地上，有的生了病，连带领民工的甲央也病了。尹正远想：草地太潮湿，这样下去，会影响施工的。他用树枝搭了几张床，让民工睡，起初民工们不愿意，尹正远找甲央谈，甲央睡上几晚，感到很舒适，他将睡床的好处告诉民工，民工开始睡起床来，各宗的民工听到后，跑来参观，床逐渐推广到各宗的营房里去。
    曲水宗的民工转移到朗嘎，他们将帐篷撑在沙洲上，沙洲四面环水，靠近工地的一边，水面较窄，他们搭上一座浮桥，通向工地。一个晚上，山洪暴发，到天明时，水快淹进帐篷了。尹正远见了，对殷相尧说：“副班长！我们得想办法，让民工渡到对岸去。”
      “浮桥冲走了，我们得搭起来，”殷相尧说。
    他们看到沙洲上有两棵大树，就将树砍倒，恰好搭到对岸去。但是水流得很急，人在树干上行走，左右幌动，女藏胞渡不过去。他俩跳到水中，用手托住树干，人和物资才全部渡到对岸。他们在水内浸了几个钟头，皮肤都冻紫了，民工们感动得掉下泪来。在一次晚会上，他们歌唱道：
    哈达再多啊！
    那有洁白的好！
    朋友再多啊！
    那比得上解放军亲！
    某连二排的战士们和龙子宗的民工在阿沛附近筑路。这一带傍着尼洋河的陡坡，土质坚硬，民工的工效很低。排长李国栋见了，心想：这样下去，不但影响民工的收入，还得延长施工的期间，要怎样才能提高工效呢？他左想右想，想不出好的办法来。一天，他发现山上有一股很大的泉水，他对战士们说：“假如把那股泉水引到工地，让水冲刷泥土，工效一定能够提高。”战士们都说这倒是好办法。他们顺着山坡挖了一条沟槽，将水引到工地，泥土经过水的冲洗，容易挖掘，工效显著提高了。在一次晚会上，男女民工和战士们尽情地歌舞，他们向战士献哈达，战士们的头上、肩上，都围满了哈达。
    某连的战士王光明，在施工期间，和拉康宗的民工结成了亲密的朋友。连上决定将王光明调到加扎宗，这消息被拉康宗的民工知道了。他们拿着哈达，跑到连部，见了连长，坚决不让王光明离开。连长好好地安慰他们，对他们说：“王光明虽然调走，我们还要派人来的。”
    战士赵光华接替了王光明的工作，经过一些日子，他又和拉康宗的民工建立了深厚的友谊。当民工施工期满，准备回到家乡的时候，他们将赵光华包围起来，有的拉着他的手，亲切地说：“同志！和我们一道，到我们的家乡去看看吧！在那里住上几天，让我们家乡的人，也认识认识解放军吧！你回来时，我们一定备好马，亲自送你啊！”赵光华婉谢了他们，安慰他们说：“将来有机会到拉康宗，一定来看你们，”临行的时候，民工们都情不自禁地掉下泪来。
    从拉萨到巴河，许多男女民工在修路中立了功，麓马岭举行的一次庆功会上，有一女民工将她戴的光荣花摘下来，佩在一位战士的胸前，她拍着战士的肩膀，感动地说：“你们帮助我们修路，又教会我们修路，我们送的礼物，你们都不受，我将这朵立功的花送给你，以表达我的心意，”会上，雪巴列空的一位老汉高兴地歌唱起来，他唱道：
    好人像仙女一样的美，
    好马像风一样的快，
    我们心爱的解放军啊！
    你们骑上马吧！
    在那广阔的原野上，
    尽情地奔驰吧！
    经历了五个年头，“金色的飘带”已经从雅安飘到拉萨，汽车满载着物资，在公路上来回地奔驰，“金色的飘带”将祖国的边疆和北京紧密地联系起来。未来的康藏高原，正像藏族民工在工地上所唱和的：“洋镐会挖出幸福的花朵，铁锹会铲出美好的家园。”
