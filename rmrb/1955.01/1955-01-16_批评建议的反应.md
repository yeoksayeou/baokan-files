Reactions to Criticism and Suggestions

    △ Zeng Qinqiu, Li Zuojing, and Zhu Zhennan from Leiyang County, Hunan Province, wrote to accept the criticism made by a reader of this newspaper on December 5th of last year. In their letter, they reviewed their shortcomings in not seriously considering how to make the inspection work more in-depth and detailed in a very short period (the county party committee stipulated that four districts should be inspected within ten days, and one to two key townships in each district should be inspected regarding the over-production of agriculture and the preparation of autumn grain storage). They also reviewed their incorrect work style and expressed their determination to correct it in the future.
    △ Yanggeleng Coal Mine, a local state-owned enterprise in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, wrote to accept the criticism from reader Zhao Shouyi (the original letter of criticism, "Correct the Wrong Attitude of Not Caring About Workers' Suffering," was published on the "Readers' Letters" page on December 5th of last year). They reviewed their capitalist management ideology and bureaucratic work style of not caring about workers' suffering and expressed their determination to correct this mistake in future work.
    △ After the "Readers' Letters" page published a reader's letter on December 5th of last year entitled "Guidance for Self-Study Youth Should Not Be Weakened," Shen Zhenmeng, Deputy Director of the Education Bureau of Suzhou Municipal People's Government, wrote to express acceptance of the reader's opinion. He stated that they planned to convene a bureau affairs meeting soon to conduct a review and formulate a plan to strengthen leadership over self-study groups of middle and primary school graduates, primary school tutoring classes, and organizing participation in labor production. Currently, a dedicated person has been assigned to study improvement suggestions.
    △ Beijing Medical College wrote to review the shortcomings of randomly transferring students in school to participate in work (the original letter of criticism was published on the "Readers' Letters" page on December 5th of last year). The letter stated that in order to correct this shortcoming, the dean convened a special meeting with relevant cadres and five students who had been transferred to jointly study how to make up lessons and continue learning. The college also instructed the leaders of each department to provide more help to them in their studies. Currently, these five students have handed over their work and returned to school to study.
    △ On December 19th of last year, the "Readers' Letters" page published a reader's letter suggesting that the transportation department save cloth used for making "tags." According to a letter from the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Railways announced on September 16th of last year that the rules and supplementary rules for the transportation of goods had decided to cancel cloth cargo tags and use paper cargo tags instead. Currently, some stations still have some old cloth cargo tags in stock, and they can all be replaced with paper tags after they are used up.
    △ After this newspaper published an excerpt from a reader's letter on December 19th of last year entitled "Do Not Distribute New Year Pictures Unsuitable for Forest Areas to Forest Areas," the Xinhua Bookstore Main Store has notified its affiliates in forest areas to immediately stop distributing such New Year pictures and posters. It also suggested that other New Year pictures that contradict the central work of the local area should also be noted, and all localities should learn from this lesson and pay attention to it at all times.
    △ Li Baozhen, head of the Qinhuangdao Engineering Section of the Guye Transportation Sub-bureau of the Tianjin Railway Administration, wrote to review the erroneous practice of his subordinate units privately recruiting workers to the countryside (the original letter of criticism was published on the "Readers' Letters" page on December 26th of last year) and expressed his determination to conscientiously implement the state's unified labor force allocation policy in the future.
    △ This newspaper published a reader's letter on January 2nd entitled "Who is Responsible for Poor Engineering Quality?" The Organization Department of the Party Committee of the Directly Subordinate Construction Engineering Bureau of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China replied in a letter that they had put forward remedial measures for the construction of the Yuci Oil Storage Depot. He also instructed engineer Guo Yingdou to earnestly examine and correct this erroneous ideological style.
    △ Qiqihar Municipal Local State-owned Xinhua Glass Instrument Factory wrote to accept the criticism from reader Chen Rang (the original criticism was published on the "Readers' Letters" page on January 2nd). The letter explained that the medical equipment produced in 1954 was of poor quality due to incorrect ingredients. Currently, the quality of the products has improved. It is hoped that all users will continue to put forward their opinions to help them further improve the quality.
