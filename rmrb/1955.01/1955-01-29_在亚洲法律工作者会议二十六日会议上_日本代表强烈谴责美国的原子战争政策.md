Xinhua News Agency, Calcutta: At the Asian Legal Workers Conference on the 26th, Dr. Ikuo Yasui, Director of the Secretariat of the Japan National Council for the Signature Campaign to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, Professor of International Law at Hosei University and Kanagawa University, and member of the Japanese delegation to the Asian Legal Workers Conference, delivered a report on banning all atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction.

Yasui said: While strongly opposing the testing and use of atomic and hydrogen bombs and demanding a strict ban on these weapons, we have not forgotten our responsibility for the Pacific War. After this last war, the Japanese have fully realized that Japanese militarism has caused infinite damage to Asian countries, and therefore we feel extremely regretful for our actions. At the same time, the Japanese people themselves have suffered unspeakable disasters. Yasui said that through these painful experiences, we have begun to seriously consider that in order to protect the lives and happiness of all people and future generations, we must never have war again.

Yasui strongly condemned the US atomic warfare policy. He said that the US atomic and hydrogen bomb tests in the Bikini area are absolutely in violation of international law. It is first worth noting that these tests are not conducted within the regular territory of the United States, but on Bikini Island, which falls within a trust territory. Yasui said that the basic purpose of the trusteeship system is stipulated in the United Nations Charter. According to the spirit of this system, the most important thing is to protect the people living in these areas. Article 76, Paragraph 2 of the United Nations Charter stipulates: "To promote the political, economic, social and educational advancement of the inhabitants of the trust territories, and their progressive development towards self-government or independence as may be appropriate to the particular circumstances of each territory and its peoples and the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned, and as may be provided by the terms of each trusteeship agreement." The United Nations Charter takes "to promote international peace and security" (Article 76, Paragraph 1) as one of the basic purposes of the trusteeship system. From the perspective of protecting the residents of the trust territories, the atomic and hydrogen bomb tests conducted by the United States in this area are a complete violation of the United Nations Charter.

Yasui then pointed out that another issue regarding the relationship between the atomic and hydrogen bomb tests conducted on Bikini Island and international law is that these tests endanger a vast area of the high seas. International law strictly prohibits any country from excluding other countries and their nationals from all or part of the high seas and governing them themselves. However, the United States has designated a danger zone in the high seas around Eniwetok and Bikini Islands to conduct atomic and hydrogen bomb tests in this area. The United States' sole rule over a portion of the high seas is clearly a violation of the basic principle of the freedom of the high seas.

Yasui further said that according to international law, the United States is responsible for compensating for all losses caused by this action. However, negotiations between Japan and the United States lasted for ten months, and the compensation promised by the United States was far less than the losses suffered by the Japanese people. Yasui emphasized: We believe that this issue is not over yet, and we should strive to ban all weapons of mass destruction, not just atomic and hydrogen bombs.

Yasui then said that according to the spirit of international law embodied in the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948, as well as some declarations, all atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction should have been banned long ago. However, now some people are openly advocating that, from the perspective of military alliances such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, atomic weapons will be used in the future. Yasui called for the conclusion of an international agreement prohibiting all atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, and clearly and specifically stipulating the details of this ban, in order to stop this. This is an urgent issue facing humanity, and we cannot ignore it even for a day.

Yasui finally described the Japanese people's struggle against atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons. He said that the Japanese people established the National Council for the Signature Campaign to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs in August last year. As of January 4, 1955, the total number of signatures collected by the National Council had reached 20,562,444, and is still increasing every day. Yasui said, we can confidently say that Japanese public opinion has firmly stood its ground. The power of public opinion influenced the Japanese government. The Yoshida Cabinet, which adopted a cooperative attitude towards the US atomic and hydrogen bomb tests, regardless of the sentiments of the people, has collapsed.

After Yasui's report, a Japanese female representative read out a telegram from the wife of the late Aikichi Kuboyama, the first victim of the US hydrogen bomb test, requesting the Asian Legal Workers Conference to guarantee unreserved efforts to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs.

    在亚洲法律工作者会议二十六日会议上
    日本代表强烈谴责美国的原子战争政策
    【新华社加尔各答讯】日本禁止原子弹和氢弹签名运动全国协议会事务局局长、法政大学和神奈川大学国际法教授、出席亚洲法律工作者会议日本代表团团员安井郁博士二十六日在亚洲法律工作者会议上做了关于禁止所有原子武器、氢武器以及其他大规模毁灭性武器的报告。
    安井郁说：在我们强烈反对关于试验和使用原子弹与氢弹并要求实行严厉禁止这些武器的时候，我们并没有忘记我们对于太平洋战争所负的责任。经过最近这一次战争，日本人已经充分地认识到：日本的军国主义使得亚洲各国遭受到无穷的损害，因此我们对于我们的行动感到极大的遗憾。同时，日本人民自己也受到说不尽的灾难。安井郁说，通过这些痛苦的经验，我们已经开始认真地考虑到：为了保护一切人民和下一代的生命和幸福，我们绝不应再有战争。
    安井郁强烈谴责美国的原子战争政策。他说，美国在比基尼地区进行的原子弹和氢弹的试验，是绝对违反国际法的。首先值得注意的是：这种试验并不是在美国的正规领土内进行的，而是在属于托管地区以内的比基尼岛上进行的。安井郁说，关于托管制度的基本目的，在联合国宪章内已有规定。根据这个制度的精神，最重要的是保护住在这些地区内的人民。联合国宪章第七十六条第二款规定：“增进托管领土居民之政治，经济，社会及教育之进展；并以适合各领土及其人民之特殊情形及关系人民自由表示之愿望为原则，并按照各托管协定之条款增进其趋向自治或独立之逐渐发展。”联合国宪章以“促进国际和平及安全”（第七十六条第一款）作为托管制度的基本目的之一。从保护托管地居民的观点来看，美国在这个地区进行的原子弹和氢弹试验是完全违反联合国宪章的。
    安井郁接着指出，在比基尼岛进行的原子弹和氢弹试验同国际法之间的关系方面的另一个问题是，这种试验使公海的广大范围遭受危险。国际法严格禁止任何国家在公海的全部或一部分排斥其他国家和国民而由它们自己统治。但是美国在恩纳威托克岛和比基尼岛周围的公海划定了一个危险地区以便在这个地区进行原子弹和氢弹的试验。美国独自统治了一部分公海，这很清楚是破坏了公海自由的基本原则。
    安井郁又说，根据国际法美国有责任赔偿因这一行动而造成的全部损失。但是日本同美国之间的谈判举行了有十个月之久，而美国答应的赔偿费却远远比不上日本人民所受到的损失。安井郁强调指出：我们认为，这个问题并不是到此为止，我们应该努力禁止一切大规模毁灭性武器，不只是原子弹和氢弹而已。
    安井郁接着说按照联合国大会一九四八年通过的关于制止和惩罚种族灭绝罪行的公约以及一些宣言中体现出的国际法的精神，所有原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器早该禁止。但是，现在却有人公开主张，从北大西洋公约组织等军事联盟的观点看来，将来要使用原子武器。安井郁呼吁说，为了制止这一点，必须缔结一个禁止所有原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器的国际协定，并明确地、具体地规定这种禁令的细节。这是人类所面临的一个迫切问题，我们甚至一天都不能忽略它。
    安井郁最后叙述了日本人民反对原子武器和氢武器的斗争。他说，日本人民在去年八月份成立了禁止原子弹和氢弹签名运动全国协议会。到一九五五年一月四日为止，全国协议会所征集的签名总数已达两千另五十六万二千四百四十四人，现在每天仍在不断地增加。安井郁说，我们能够有把握地说，日本的舆论已经牢固地站住了脚跟。舆论的力量影响了日本政府。不顾全国人民的情绪对美国的原子弹及氢弹试验采取合作态度的吉田内阁已经倒台了。
    安井郁报告后，一位日本女代表在会上宣读了美国氢弹试验的第一个牺牲者、已故的久保山爱吉的妻子的一封电报，这位代表要求亚洲法律工作者会议保证以无保留的努力禁止原子弹和氢弹。
