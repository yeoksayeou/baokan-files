From the current situation of manure collection in various regions, most parts of the country have increased compared to the same period in previous years, but it is still far from meeting the needs of agricultural production this year. The shortage of fertilizer is very serious.

Why can't farmers' manure collection meet the needs of agricultural production? One of the main reasons is that some cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the year-by-year increase in fertilizer demand, and they have relaxed their leadership in manure collection. They believe that the amount of manure collected has been increasing year by year, and the area of fertilization has been expanding year by year. They are satisfied with the existing achievements in manure collection, and they have neglected this important work related to agricultural production increase. They should understand that due to the development of mutual aid and cooperation and agricultural production, the promotion of new agricultural tools, the implementation of agricultural technology reforms, and the expansion of economic crop areas, the demand for fertilizer is increasing. Some cadres, although they have realized the serious situation of fertilizer shortage, believe that there is no fertilizer to collect, or they place their hopes on commercial fertilizers. They do not understand that the main way to solve the fertilizer shortage problem at present is to explore various potentially usable fertilizer sources in rural areas and mobilize farmers to collect more farm manure. Commercial fertilizer can only play a supplementary role in solving the fertilizer shortage problem.

Facts have proved that there are many potentially usable fertilizer sources in rural areas. It is estimated that the utilization rate of human and animal excrement in agricultural areas across the country is currently less than 60% of the total discharge. If half of the remaining part can be utilized, the nitrogen content alone is equivalent to several million tons of ammonium sulfate. The phenomenon of livestock without pens is still quite common in some areas. Henan has four million pigs, about half of which do not have pens. If these pigs can be penned up, the fertilizer effect of the accumulated manure would be equivalent to more than 400 million jin of bean cake. Other examples include rotten fish and smelly shrimps in coastal areas, aquatic plants and river and pond mud in lake and river areas, weeds and fallen leaves in mountainous areas, and garbage and miscellaneous fertilizers near towns, all of which are excellent composting materials. Last summer, Hebei Province convened a meeting to arrange the summer manure collection work in various counties, requiring the entire province to collect 100 billion jin of "more grass and less soil, easily rotten" grass fertilizer. As a result, many areas overfulfilled the plan. Zhangjiakou Prefecture used to have poor manure collection, but this time it strengthened the leadership of manure collection work, and the amount of manure collected exceeded the same period of the previous year by more than 60%. This proves that as long as the organizational leadership is strengthened and effective measures are taken, the mass manure collection movement can be rapidly launched, and the amount of manure collected can be greatly increased.

Taking agricultural production cooperatives as the center to lead mutual aid groups and the broad masses of farmers in increasing farm manure is a major link in carrying out the manure collection movement. Leading agricultural production cooperatives to increase farm manure, increase yields, reduce costs, and increase the actual income of members is a very important way to consolidate and improve agricultural production cooperatives. The Lü Hongbin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ju County, Shandong Province, learned from the past lessons of disregarding costs, using a large amount of commercial fertilizer, and having low actual income for its members. Last year, it organized its members to dig pond mud, replace old pits, and raise pigs to collect manure, collecting a total of more than 6,300 carts of fertilizer, reducing production costs. As a result, the income of the members last year increased by more than 90,000 jin of grain compared to the previous year, which promoted the consolidation and development of the cooperative.

To do a good job in the manure collection work of agricultural production cooperatives, we should seriously solve the problem of reasonable evaluation and scoring of the labor performed by members in manure collection. For the manure collected by the members themselves, the price should be reasonably set according to the quantity and quality to encourage the members' enthusiasm for manure collection. The "May Fourth" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chaoyang County, Rehe Province, initially set the price of manure unreasonably. Member Wang Shouzhi said when sending manure: "In the future, let the cooperative collect it uniformly, and the members' own collection is not enough." After the work team corrected the unreasonable evaluation of manure, the enthusiasm of the members for manure collection greatly increased. At present, agricultural production cooperatives have developed greatly, which is a favorable condition for carrying out winter and spring manure collection. All regions should widely mobilize agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups with the conditions to formulate practical manure collection plans with quantity and quality requirements and do a good job in manure collection within the cooperatives.

In the process of leading agricultural production cooperatives to do a good job in manure collection, attention should also be paid to mobilizing and helping mutual aid groups and individual farmers to collect enough fertilizer. When leading agricultural production cooperatives to solve the problem of mutual benefit in manure collection, the heads or representatives of mutual aid groups should be invited to participate to help the mutual aid groups solve this problem. At present, individual farmers still account for a considerable proportion in rural areas, and attention should also be paid to helping them overcome various difficulties in manure collection work.

State-owned farms in various regions must do a good job in manure collection and set an example for the masses. Agricultural technology promotion stations should use winter schools to earnestly teach manure collection and fertilization techniques and deeply summarize and promote the experience of the masses in manure collection and preservation.

Strengthening green manure cultivation and management is also a reliable way to increase fertilizer. Last year, the area of winter-sown green manure in southern regions not only failed to complete the plan, but also decreased compared with the actual sown area in 1953. However, if we pay attention to the drainage and irrigation of green manure fields, apply appropriate amounts of fertilizer, prevent freezing, and prevent and control diseases and insect pests, and increase the yield per unit area of green manure, we can still increase a portion of fertilizer. Regions with experience and conditions should guide farmers to increase the amount of spring-sown green manure as much as possible, and carry out early spring intercropping and intercropping in the rows of winter wheat, rape, radish and other winter crops. During this year's spring plowing, all regions cultivating green manure should pay attention to organizing and allocating labor and livestock power to ensure timely plowing and maximize the effectiveness of green manure.

    加强对冬春积肥工作的领导
    农业部土地利用总局
    从目前各地积肥的情况来看，全国大部地区都比往年同时期有所增加，但还是远远不能满足今年农业生产上的需要；缺肥的情况是十分严重的。
    为什么农家积肥不能满足农业生产的需要呢？主要原因之一是有些干部对需肥量的逐年增长认识不足，放松了对于积肥工作的领导。他们认为积肥的数量已经逐年增加，施肥的面积已经逐年扩大，满足于现有的积肥成绩，对这项有关农业增产的重要工作竟忽视了。他们应该了解，由于互助合作和农业生产的发展，新农具的推广，农业技术改革的推行，经济作物面积的扩大，需肥的数量已越来越大。还有些干部虽然已经认识到肥料不足的严重情况，但却认为无肥可积，或把希望寄托在商品肥料方面。他们不了解目前解决肥料不足的主要办法，就是要挖掘农村各种可能利用的肥源，发动农民多积存农家肥料，商品肥料对解决缺肥问题只能起一种辅助作用。
    事实证明，农村可能用的肥源是很多的。据估计，目前全国农业地区的人畜粪尿的利用还不到排泄总量的百分之六十，其余部分，如能设法利用一半，仅所含氮素即相当几百万吨硫酸铵。牲畜无圈的现象，在某些地区仍然相当普遍。河南有四百万头猪，约有一半没有圈。如果能把这些猪设法圈起来，所积粪尿的肥效，就抵得上四亿多斤豆饼。他如沿海地区的烂鱼臭虾，滨湖河川地区的水草、河塘泥，山区的杂草落叶，城镇附近的垃圾杂肥等，都是极好的堆肥材料。去年夏天，河北省召集会议，布置各县的夏季积肥工作，要求全省积一千亿斤“草多土少沤得烂”的草肥，结果很多地区都超额完成计划。张家口专区以往积肥较差，这次加强对积肥工作的领导，积肥数量超过前年同时期百分之六十以上。这就证明只要加强组织领导，采取有效措施，群众性的积肥运动是可以迅速开展起来的，积肥数量是可以大大增加的。
    以农业生产合作社为中心带动互助组和广大农民群众增积农家肥料，是开展积肥运动的一个主要环节。领导农业生产合作社增积农家肥料，提高产量，降低成本，增加社员实际收入，是巩固和提高农业生产社的一个很重要的办法。山东莒县吕鸿宾农业生产合作社，接受了过去不顾成本，大量使用商品肥料，社员实际收入不多的教训，在去年组织社员挖塘泥、换旧坑和养猪积肥等，共积肥六千三百多车，降低了生产成本，结果去年社员的收入比前年增加九万多斤粮食，促进了社的巩固和发展。
    要做好农业生产合作社的积肥工作，应认真解决社员在积肥方面所进行的劳动的合理评工记分问题；对社员自积肥料，应按数量、质量合理作价，以鼓励社员积肥的积极性。热河省朝阳县“五四”农业生产合作社开始对粪价定得不合理，社员王守智送粪时说：“今后由社统一攒吧，社员自己攒不够本。”经工作组纠正粪肥评价不合理的现象后，社员们积肥的积极性大大提高。目前农业生产合作社已有很大的发展，这是开展冬春积肥的有利条件，各地应广泛发动农业生产合作社和有条件的互助组，制订有数量、质量的切实可行的积肥计划，做好社内积肥工作。
    在领导农业生产合作社做好积肥工作的过程中，应同时注意发动、帮助互助组和单干农民积到足够肥料。在领导农业生产合作社解决积肥互利问题时，应吸收互助组组长或代表参加，帮助互助组解决这方面的问题；目前单干农民在农村仍占相当大数量，也应注意帮助他们克服积肥工作中的各种困难。
    各地国营农场必须做好积肥工作，给群众树立榜样；农业技术推广站应利用冬学认真传授积肥施肥技术，深入总结推广群众积肥保肥经验。
    加强绿肥栽培管理工作，也是增加肥料的一个可靠办法。去年南方各地冬播绿肥面积，不仅没有完成计划，而且比一九五三年的实播面积减少。但如果注意绿肥田的排水灌溉，适量施肥，防冻，防治病虫害等工作，提高绿肥单位面积产量，还是可以增加一部分肥料。有经验和有条件的地区，应该指导农民尽可能增加春播绿肥数量，在冬麦、油菜、萝卜等冬季作物行间，进行早春套种、间种。今年春耕期间，凡栽培绿肥的地区，都应注意组织调配劳畜力，做到适时翻耕，发挥绿肥的最大效用。
