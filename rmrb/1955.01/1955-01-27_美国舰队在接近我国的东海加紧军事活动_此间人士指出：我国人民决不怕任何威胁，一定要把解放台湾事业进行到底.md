Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 26th: The U.S. Seventh Fleet is intensifying military activities near China's East Sea. Since January 23rd, most of the U.S. Seventh Fleet's ships, including the aircraft carriers "Yorktown," "Kearsarge," "Essex," and "Hornet," three heavy cruisers including the "Helena," and more than ten destroyers, have successively sailed from the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan, and other places to concentrate for military activities east and southeast of Dachen Island, approaching China's East Sea. In recent days, large numbers of U.S. Navy aircraft taking off from these aircraft carriers have continuously circled the airspace over the sea near Dachen Island.

Personages here pointed out: The U.S. authorities' order for its Seventh Fleet to carry out this provocative activity further exposes the ugly face of U.S. imperialism intensifying its interference in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan and the coastal islands. The great Chinese people absolutely fear no intimidation or threats and will continue their efforts to carry the cause of liberating Taiwan and eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique through to final victory.

    美国舰队在接近我国的东海加紧军事活动
    此间人士指出：我国人民决不怕任何威胁，一定要把解放台湾事业进行到底
    【新华社北京二十六日讯】美国第七舰队正在接近我国的东海海面上加紧军事活动。从一月二十三日起，美国第七舰队的大部舰只，包括航空母舰“约克敦号”、“基尔沙基号”、“埃赛克斯号”、“大黄蜂号”等四艘，重巡洋舰“赫勒拿号”等三艘和驱逐舰十多艘，相继从菲律宾、香港、日本等地驶抵大陈岛以东及东南接近我国东海海面上集中进行军事活动。连日来，从这些航空母舰上起飞的大批美国海军飞机，不断盘旋于大陈岛以东附近海面上空。
    此间人士指出：美国当局命令它的第七舰队进行这种挑衅性的活动，更加暴露了美帝国主义加紧干涉中国人民解放台湾和沿海岛屿的狰狞面目。伟大的中国人民决不怕任何恫吓和威胁，将再接再厉地把解放台湾、消灭蒋贼卖国集团的事业进行到最后胜利。
