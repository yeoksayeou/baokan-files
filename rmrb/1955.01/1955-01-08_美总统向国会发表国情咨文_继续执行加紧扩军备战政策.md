Xinhua News Agency, Washington: According to a TASS report from Washington: US President Eisenhower delivered his State of the Union Address to a joint session of the House of Representatives and the Senate on the 6th. The first part of the address outlined the US foreign policy, enumerating the various diplomatic measures taken by the US to establish military blocs and alliances in various regions of the world. The US President described the establishment of military blocs and measures to revive German militarism as "defensive measures" that purportedly help ensure peace. Eisenhower also said that the US "must be willing to use all avenues of negotiation, provided that these negotiations promote the cause of securing a just and reliable peace, to which the United States and other free nations are dedicated."

However, despite his promise that the US desires peace, his address demonstrated that the US intends to continue pursuing a policy of intensified arms expansion.

A significant portion of the address dealt with this year's military budget and war preparations. Eisenhower called for the development of all types of weapons and forces for all branches of the military to be used to launch new wars. The address stated that the military budget "stipulates a continued vigorous increase in the stockpiles of strategic and essential materials, consolidating our (US) mobilization base. The budget also stipulates the reconfiguration of the strength of certain military branches, so that our (US) strength is strategically concentrated." The address pointed out that the US will "continue to improve and expand the production of nuclear weapons for the army, navy, and air force."

In order to justify these war preparations, Eisenhower repeated the long-bankrupt slander of the so-called "Soviet threat."

Eisenhower's address proved that US domestic policy will be completely subordinate to the goals of US imperialist foreign policy. For example, it can be seen from the address that, under the pretext of suppressing "subversive activities," any resistance to the current policies of the US ruling group will continue to be suppressed.

The address also mentioned that, due to government military spending, it would be impossible to make any tax cuts this year.

    美总统向国会发表国情咨文
    继续执行加紧扩军备战政策
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社华盛顿讯：美国总统艾森豪威尔六日在美国国会众议院和参议院联席会议上发表国情咨文。咨文的第一部分概述了美国的外交政策，列举了美国为了在世界各地区建立军事集团和联盟所采取的各种外交措施。美国总统把建立军事集团以及复活德国军国主义的措施，说成是似乎有助于保障和平的“防御措施”。艾森豪威尔还说，美国“必须愿意利用一切谈判的途径，只要这些谈判能促进保障公正的和可靠的和平的事业，美国和其他自由国家是献身于这种事业的”。
    但是，尽管他提出美国希望和平的诺言，他的咨文却证明，美国打算继续奉行加紧扩充军备的政策。
    咨文以相当一部分谈到今年的军事预算和战争准备。艾森豪威尔要求发展一切种类的武器和各兵种的部队，以便用来发动新的战争。咨文说，军事预算“规定继续大力增加战略物资和最重要的物资的储备，巩固我们（美国）的动员基础。预算还规定重新配置某些兵种的力量，以使我们（美国）的力量在战略上集中”。咨文指出，美国将“继续改进和扩大陆、海、空军用的核子武器的生产”。
    艾森豪威尔为了替这些战争准备辩护，重复了早已破产的所谓存在“苏联威胁”的谰言。
    艾森豪威尔的咨文证明，美国对内政策将完全服从于美帝国主义的外交政策的目的，例如，从咨文中可以看出，在所谓制止“颠覆活动”的借口下，将继续镇压对于美国统治集团现行政策的任何反抗。
    咨文还谈到，由于政府的军事支出，今年不可能对税额作任何削减。
