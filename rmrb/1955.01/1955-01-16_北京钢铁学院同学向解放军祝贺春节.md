    Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology Students Congratulate the People's Liberation Army on the Spring Festival
To the esteemed comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army,

    The Spring Festival is approaching. As we sit quietly under the bright electric lights, here in Beijing, the heart of our motherland, and write to you, your heroic images and the beautiful scenes of our motherland appear vividly before our eyes.

    There are so many things we want to write about, so much we want to say! Where should we begin?

    Before liberation, you rarely saw large-scale construction of factories and dormitories. If you did see any construction, it would take years, even decades, to complete. But now, you can see construction sites everywhere, with tall buildings going up in a very short period of time. Take our school area as an example! In the winter of 1952, this was still a field of sorghum stubble. But by the autumn of 1953, new buildings were springing up like mushrooms after rain. Now, we are attending classes in our newly built school buildings. At the same time as our school, more than ten other colleges were built, and this area has become a vast and beautiful university town, where tens of thousands of young people are studying various kinds of scientific knowledge for the economic and cultural construction of our motherland. What a great change this is!

    The day before yesterday afternoon, all the fourth-year students of the open-hearth steelmaking major in the Department of Metallurgy held a meeting to discuss how to report to the motherland with better academic achievements, and also held group discussions on how to support you with practical actions.

    Recently, we accepted the glorious task given to us by the motherland, which requires each of us to complete a graduation design in the next semester, that is, before we graduate. In this design, we are required to summarize the scientific knowledge we have learned in the past three and a half years, and each of us will design a steelmaking workshop of a steel plant. Moreover, each person's task is different. For example, some people will design the renovation of the existing No. 1 Steelmaking Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and some people will design the construction of a large steel plant with an annual output of several hundred thousand tons of steel in different parts of the motherland (Benxi, Taiyuan, Beijing, etc.). This task was proposed to us under the specific help of Soviet experts, and also under the needs of the motherland's economic construction and national defense construction. Comrades, how happy we should be when we accept this glorious task! Our study tasks are closely linked to the task of liberating Taiwan. You are the people who use steel, and we are the people who are preparing to participate in the production of steel, so our relationship is even closer. In order to prepare more and better high-quality steel weapons for you, that is, in order to do a good job in our graduation design in the next semester, our learning summary this semester is even more meaningful. Therefore, we deeply feel that summarizing this semester's study with excellent academic achievements is the most practical action to support you in fiercely attacking the enemy.

    We are college students of the new China. Under the cultivation and education of the Party and under your protection, our life is very pleasant and rich. Now, we are actively participating in the physical training in preparation for the labor defense system, and are always ready to defend the motherland. At the same time, we are carrying out a variety of cultural activities. We have composed a steelmaking dance, choreographed a joint naval and army operation dance to liberate Taiwan, and also have a recitation poem and chorus to liberate Taiwan, which will be performed at the New Year's school-wide literary and artistic performance.

    We have never forgotten that on the opposite shore of the ocean, on the last piece of land of our motherland, there are still many brothers and sisters who are suffering from the persecution of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group. They are eagerly waiting for us to drive away those robbers and liberate them. Comrades, this is our common responsibility.

    We oppose the US-Chiang aggressive treaty. We must carry out the struggle with greater efforts. We must liberate Taiwan. We will definitely support you with all our strength.

                Students of Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, Wen Zhendong, Wu Xuelian

### 北京钢铁学院同学向解放军祝贺春节

    北京钢铁学院同学向解放军祝贺春节编辑同志请转敬爱的中国人民解放军同志们：
    春节来了，当我们安静地坐在明亮的电灯光下，在祖国的心脏北京，展开纸笔给你们写信的时候，你们的英勇形象和祖国的美丽图景一齐湧现到我们的眼前。
    想写的事情真多啊。要说的话太多了，从什么地方说起呢！
    在解放以前，你是很少看到大规模地建筑工厂和宿舍的，偶尔看到一点建筑，也是几年甚至十几年才能造好。现在呢，你到处可以看到大片的建筑工地，高大的楼房，在很短的期间内就盖起来了。就拿我们学校地区来说吧！在一九五二年冬季，这里还是一片高粱茬子地呢，但是到了一九五三年的秋季，一幢一幢的新房子像雨后春笋似地冒出来了；现在，我们已经在新建的校舍里上课了。和我们学校同时建造的还有其他十来个学院，这里已经变成了一座幅员广阔、环境幽美的大学城了，上万的青年，正在为祖国的经济文化建设学习着各种各样的科学知识。这是多大的变化啊！
    前天下午，我们冶金系马丁炉炼钢专业四年级全体同学，开了一次大会，研究了怎样用更好的学习成绩向祖国汇报的问题，还分组讨论了怎样用实际行动来支援你们。
    最近我们接受了祖国给我们的光荣任务，要我们在下学期，也就是在我们毕业前，每人要作一个毕业设计，在这个设计里，要求我们总结三年半以来所学到的科学知识，每人设计一个钢铁厂的炼钢车间；而且每个人的任务不同，例如，有的人要作改建现有鞍山钢铁公司第一炼钢厂的设计，有的人要作出在祖国不同的地方（本溪、太原、北京等地）新建起年产量若干万吨钢的大型钢厂的设计。这是在苏联专家的具体帮助下，也是祖国经济建设国防建设的需要下向我们提出来的任务。同志们，当我们接受这种光荣的任务的时候该是多么高兴啊！我们的学习任务和解放台湾的任务紧密地联在一起了。你们是使用钢铁的人，而我们是准备参加生产钢铁的，因此，我们的关系就更加亲密了。为了准备使你们得到更多更好的优质钢铁的武器，也就是说为了作好我们下学期的毕业设计，我们这学期的学习总结就显得更加富有意义了。所以，我们深切地感到用优良的学习成绩来总结这一学期的学习，就是支援你们狠狠地打击敌人的最实际的行动。
    我们是新中国的大学生，在党的培养教导下，在你们的保卫下，生活是非常愉快而丰富的。现在，我们正在积极参加准备劳动卫国制的体育标准锻炼，随时准备着保卫祖国；同时，我们正在开展着多种多样的文化活动。我们编写了一个炼钢舞，编演了一定要解放台湾的海陆军联合作战舞，还有一定要解放台湾的朗诵诗和大合唱，在新年的全校文艺观摩大会上演出。
    我们一刻也没有忘记，在不远的海洋对岸，在祖国最后的一块土地上，还有许多的兄弟姊妹正在遭受着美国帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团的迫害；他们迫切地期待着我们赶走那些强盗，把他们解放出来。同志们，这是我们的共同责任。
    我们反对美蒋的侵略条约，我们要用更大的努力进行斗争，我们一定要解放台湾，我们一定全力支援你们。
