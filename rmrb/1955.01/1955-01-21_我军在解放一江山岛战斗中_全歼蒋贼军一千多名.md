Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Front, 20th: The Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Zhejiang front has achieved a significant victory in the battle to liberate Yijiangshan Island. According to preliminary statistics, the achievements are as follows:

    I. The complete annihilation of the Chiang bandit troops stationed on the island, including the Yijiangshan area command's subordinate units, the 4th Assault Battalion, the 2nd Company of the 2nd Assault Battalion, and the artillery company, resulting in over one thousand and eighty Chiang bandit officers and soldiers killed or captured. This includes over five hundred Chiang bandit officers and soldiers killed in action and over five hundred and fifty captured, including Wang Fubi, the commander of the Chiang bandit 4th Assault Battalion.

    II. The seizure of two 105mm howitzers, one mountain gun, six 4.2-inch mortars, three twin-barreled anti-aircraft guns, three 57mm anti-tank guns, eleven 81mm mortars, fifteen heavy machine guns, seventy-two light machine guns, twenty-seven 60mm rocket launchers, a total of three hundred and thirty-three rifles, carbines, and submachine guns, fifteen pistols, 110,000 rounds of various types of ammunition, and over 8,900 rounds of various types of artillery shells. In addition, a large amount of military supplies were seized.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Front, 20th: Our correspondent reports on the battle situation of our army liberating Yijiangshan Island on the Zhejiang front:

    On the morning of January 18, landing craft, fully loaded with our army's landing forces and escorted by warships, gunboats, and炮船, speedily sailed from various locations to the port of departure. The five-star red flag fluttered on every vessel, and our air force's war eagles streaked through the sky from time to time. Slogans encouraging the departing troops were written on billboards leading to the docks: "Comrades, the time has come to perform meritorious service for the motherland!"

    Starting in the morning, our massive air force mixed formations fiercely bombed the Chiang bandit troops' positions on Yijiangshan Island and Dachen Island, with intense smoke and fire rising in many places. Simultaneously, our long-range artillery carried out a fierce cross-sea bombardment, pouring hundreds of tons of shells onto the Chiang bandit troops' positions on Yijiangshan Island. The sounds of bombs and artillery shells merged into a deafening roar, and the island quickly transformed into a misty island shrouded in smoke. It was impossible to distinguish the sound of each artillery shell exploding; only the flashes of artillery shells bursting in the smoke could be seen through binoculars. Many of the Chiang bandit troops' bunkers and fortifications were destroyed.

    In the afternoon, amidst the tremendous explosions of bombs and artillery shells, our army launched a heroic advance at sea. Countless landing craft, under the cover of warships, gunboats, and炮船, as well as the air force, advanced in several arrowheads towards Yijiangshan Island, cleaving through the waves. At this time, our coastal artillery intensified its bombardment, and waves of aircraft continued to strafe and bomb the Chiang bandit troops' positions. Soon, a large number of our gunboats and炮船 formed a magnificent formation in the sea in front of Yijiangshan Island, pouring volleys of artillery shells onto the Chiang bandit troops' beachhead positions. Our fleet also sailed to the sides of Yijiangshan Island, launching fierce bombardments on the rear and blind spots of the Chiang bandit troops' positions on the island with massive naval guns.

    As the soldiers on the landing craft approached the shore for a courageous assault, the Chiang bandit troops on the island fired artillery in an attempt to block our army's landing. The remaining Chiang bandit troops' beachhead positions also echoed with intense machine-gun fire amidst the smoke. But these were quickly drowned out by the sounds of our army's bombs and artillery shells. Five Chiang bandit ships that had sailed out of Dachen Island's harbor were also beaten back in a flurry by our air force and fleet. After a fierce battle, landing green signal flares flew into the sky from the smoke on Yijiangshan Island. Our army's various landing forces successively captured the beachhead positions of Yueqing Reef, Huangyan Reef, and Haimen Reef according to the command's scheduled time. This was at 14:35 hours.

    A fierce battle then unfolded on the island. Our army's powerful artillery directly paved the way for the infantry units to advance. Assault teams courageously defeated the Chiang bandit troops' resistance, seizing the remaining bunkers and fortifications on the island. Tracer bullets flew from time to time. The banner of victory soon flew atop Yijiangshan Island's Peak 203. By sunset, the Chiang bandit troops on the island had been completely annihilated.

    At night, our army's logistics units continuously transported ammunition, food, and other military supplies onto Yijiangshan Island. From then on, this island will become one of the important fortresses for defending the motherland, liberating Taiwan, and liberating the coastal islands.

    我军在解放一江山岛战斗中
    全歼蒋贼军一千多名
    【新华社浙江前线二十日电】浙江前线中国人民解放军在解放一江山岛战斗中获得重大战绩。据初步统计的战绩如下：
    一、全部歼灭岛上蒋贼军一江山地区司令部的所属部队、突击第四大队、突击第二大队二中队和炮兵中队，共毙、俘蒋贼军官兵一千零八十多名，内击毙蒋贼军官兵五百多名，俘掳蒋贼突击第四大队大队长王辅弼以下官兵五百五十多名。
    二、缴获蒋贼军一零五公厘口径榴弹炮二门，山炮一门，四点二吋口径迫击炮六门，双管机关炮三门，五七战防炮三门，八一迫击炮十一门，重机关枪十五挺，轻机关枪七十二挺，六零火箭筒二十七个，步枪、卡宾枪、冲锋枪共三百三十三支，手枪十五支，各种子弹十一万发，各种炮弹八千九百多发。另外，缴获了许多军用物资。
    【新华社浙江前线二十日电】本社记者报道浙江前线我军解放一江山岛的战斗情形：
    一月十八日早上，满载着我军登陆部队的登陆艇，在军舰、炮艇和炮船的护卫下，从各处神速地驶到出征的港湾里。五星红旗在各个舰艇上飘扬，空中不时地掠过我空军的战鹰。在通向码头的标语牌上写着鼓励出征的口号：“同志们，为祖国立功的时候到了！”
    从上午开始，我庞大的空军混合机群猛烈地轰炸了一江山岛和大陈岛的蒋贼军阵地，许多地方冒起了浓烈的烟火。同时我军的远射程大炮也进行猛烈的隔海轰击，将数百吨炮弹倾泻到一江山岛蒋贼军的阵地上。炸弹声和炮弹声汇成一片巨响，这个海岛旋即变成了一座被硝烟笼罩的雾岛。这时已经无法分辨每发炮弹的爆炸声，只能用望远镜看到在烟雾中的炮弹迸发的闪光。有许多蒋贼军的地堡和工事都被摧毁了。
    下午，在炸弹和炮弹的巨大的爆炸声中，我军在海上展开了英勇的进军。数不清的登陆艇在军舰、炮艇和炮船及空军的掩护下，分成几个箭头向着一江山岛破浪前进。这时，我军海岸上的炮火更加猛烈地轰击着，一批又一批的飞机继续扫射和轰炸着蒋贼军的阵地。不久，我军大批炮舰、炮船在一江山岛正面的海上摆开了雄伟的队形，将连发的炮弹倾泻在蒋贼军的滩头阵地上。我军的舰队也驶到了一江山岛的两侧，以巨大的舰炮向着岛上蒋贼军阵地的后方和死角点进行猛烈的轰击。
    当登陆艇上的战士们快要靠岸进行奋勇冲击的时候，岛上蒋贼军发射出企图拦阻我军登陆的炮火。残存的蒋贼军滩头阵地上也在烟雾中响起了激烈的机关枪声。但这些很快地就被我军的炸弹和炮弹声淹没了。从大陈岛港湾里驶出来的五艘蒋贼舰艇，也被我空军和舰队打得慌忙逃走。经过一场激烈的战斗，登陆的绿光信号弹从一江山岛的烟雾里飞到高空。我军各路登陆部队按照指挥部的预定时间先后攻占了乐清礁、黄岩礁、海门礁等滩头阵地。这时是十四时三十五分。
    接着在岛上展开了激烈的战斗。我军的强大炮火直接地为步兵部队开辟了前进的道路。突击队奋勇地击败着蒋贼军的抵抗，夺取了岛上残存的碉堡和工事。曳光弹不时地飞舞着。胜利的红旗不久就在一江山岛的二零三高峰上飘扬起来。到夕阳西沉的时候，岛上的蒋贼军就被全部歼灭了。
    入夜，我军后勤部队就源源不断地把弹药、食品等军用物资运上了一江山岛。这个海岛从此将成为保卫祖国、解放台湾和沿海岛屿的重要堡垒之一。
