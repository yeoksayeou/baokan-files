Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 15th: According to TASS, the weekly "France Observateur" published an article by former French Minister Gabiton, who recently returned from a trip to Indochina. He sharply criticized the French government's policy in South Vietnam, saying that South Vietnam is actually under the rule of U.S. General Collins.

He wrote: "On my second visit to Indochina, I can say that the (Mendès-France) government has done nothing to revise its policy in South Vietnam, and the situation there continues to deteriorate. The situation in Saigon is so complicated, and the news coming from there is so ambiguous and deliberately confusing, that it is difficult for the French public to see the truth. But if we strip away all the events that obscure the real situation, then everything is clear and simple. The French government has in fact handed over its power to the Americans. If there is a policy in South Vietnam, it is the policy implemented by General Collins on behalf of the U.S. government. As for the French representatives, they only received one order: not to have their own political views, but to provide the Americans with the tools they lack in implementing their policy, the most important of which is the Expeditionary Corps."

Gabiton pointed out that the policy pursued by the United States harmed French interests, and then said: This policy is based on the fact that neither the United States nor their South Vietnamese official Ngo Dinh Diem's government signed the Geneva Accords. Therefore, they do not consider themselves bound by the obligations stipulated in these international documents. Ngo Dinh Diem's continued rule is due to the support of the United States, which believes that he embodies "the most hostile force to the Geneva Accords."

Gabiton said that today in South Vietnam, anyone who mentions the need to fulfill the Geneva Accords is arrested. There, people openly say that the general election scheduled for July 1956 will not be held, because the authorities there intend to continue the "cold war" against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, prepare to impose an economic blockade on North Vietnam, and put pressure on French businessmen to prevent them from supporting the economic agreement that French representative Saint-Denis is negotiating in Hanoi.

Gabiton continued, "The United States is completely free to pursue such a policy that can only lead to bankruptcy, just like in China. However, it is impermissible and unimaginable for France to endorse this policy, because France signed the Geneva Accords and is undoubtedly responsible for fulfilling the Geneva Accords in the South (Vietnam)."

    法国前部长加比唐撰文
    抨击法政府向美国出卖南越
   【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十四日讯：“法兰西观察家”周报刊载了最近刚游历印度支那归来的前法国部长加比唐所写的一篇文章。他尖锐地斥责法国政府在南越的政策说，南越实际上是在美国的柯林斯将军的统治之下。
    他写道：“在我第二次访问印度支那时，我可以这样说，（孟戴斯—弗朗斯）政府在重订它在南越的政策方面什么也没做，那边的情况在继续恶化。西贡的形势是这样的复杂，从那里来的消息又是这样的暧昧和有意弄得纠缠不清，以致使法国公众很难看出端倪。但是，如果我们拨开一切遮蔽着真正局势的事件的话，那么一切就很清楚和简单了。法国政府事实上已把它的权力让给了美国人。如果说，在南越有一个政策的话，那么这个政策就是柯林斯将军奉美国政府之命所实行的那个政策。而就法国的代表来说，他们只接到一个命令：不要有他们自己的政治主张，而把美国人在实行他们的政策时所缺乏的工具交给他们，其中最重要的就是远征军团。”
    加比唐指出美国奉行的政策损害了法国的利益，然后说：这个政策是基于这个事实：不论是美国或者是他们的南越官吏吴庭艳的政府都没有在日内瓦协定上签字。因此他们不认为他们是受这些国际文件所规定的义务所约束的。吴庭艳的继续执政，是由于美国的支持，美国认为他体现了“最敌视日内瓦协定的力量”。
    加比唐说，今天在南越凡是提到必须履行日内瓦协定的人都遭到逮捕。在那里人们公开地说，预定在一九五六年七月举行的普选将不会举行，因为那里的当局打算对越南民主共和国继续进行“冷战”，准备对北越实行经济封锁，并且对法国商人们施行压力，使他们不得支持法国代表圣德尼正在河内谈判的经济协定。
    加比唐接着说，“美国完全有自由来奉行这样一个只能够引向破产的政策，正像在中国那样。但是，法国赞成这个政策是不许可的，并且是不可想像的，因为法国曾在日内瓦协定上签字，并且毫无疑问的是对在南部（越南）履行日内瓦协定负有责任。”
