    Shanxi and Other Regions Actively Exploit New Oil Sources
    Many regions in Shanxi, Hebei, Sichuan, and other provinces are actively exploiting new oil sources. Oil companies in Shanxi, Hebei, and other provinces have already successfully extracted oil from cocklebur seeds, Chinese toon seeds, and other sources. Cocklebur seeds are produced in large quantities in the wild in many areas; it is estimated that Zhangjiakou Prefecture in Hebei Province alone produces nearly 10 million jin annually. The production of Chinese toon seeds is also very large; Yuci Prefecture in Shanxi Province alone can purchase approximately 4 million jin annually each year. According to trial pressing results in Shanxi Province, 100 jin of cocklebur seeds can yield 11 jin of oil, and 100 jin of Chinese toon seeds can yield 20 jin of oil. Fully utilizing these oilseeds can increase oil sources significantly. Most of these new oil products can be used as industrial oils, and some can also be edible. Cocklebur seed oil can be used as a raw material for paints, inks, and soaps, and the oil cake can be used as fertilizer. Tung oil extracted by the Santai County Company of the China Oils and Fats Company in Sichuan Province can be eaten, used for lighting lamps, or used as an industrial oil; the oil cake can be used as fertilizer and pig feed.

    山西等地积极开辟新油源
    山西、河北、四川等省许多地区积极开辟新油源。山西、河北等省的油脂公司已经用苍耳籽、椿树籽等榨油成功。苍耳籽在许多地区的野外都大量出产，仅河北省张家口专区，据估计每年产量就近千万斤。椿树籽产量也很大，仅山西省榆次专区每年就约可收购四百万斤。据山西省试榨结果，每百斤苍耳籽可出油十一斤，每百斤椿树籽可出油二十斤。充分利用这些油料，可以增加大量油源。这些新油品大都可作工业用油，有的还可以食用。苍耳籽油可以作油漆、油墨、肥皂的原料，油饼可作肥料。中国油脂公司四川省三台县公司榨的梧桐籽油可以食用，可以用来点灯，用作工业用油；油饼可作肥料和喂猪饲料。　　（胡宏绩、张秉谦等）
