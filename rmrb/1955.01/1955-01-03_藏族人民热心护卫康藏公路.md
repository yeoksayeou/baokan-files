Within the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province, Tibetan people are actively participating in the maintenance and protection of the Kangding-Tibet Highway. A large number of Tibetans have voluntarily requested to work as road maintenance workers, and many of them have become model figures. For example, Ci Village and his wife, along with other Tibetan road workers, often get up in the cold of midnight to voluntarily clear snow from the highway. Once, he single-handedly captured three bad elements who were sabotaging a bridge. Tibetan people living along the highway are also voluntarily protecting the road; wherever they are needed, they appear. Last year, when the Waze Bridge in Kangding County was destroyed by floods, many Tibetans voluntarily carried tents and food from dozens of miles away to help with the emergency repairs. In 1952, when a section of the highway in Lufu County was damaged by floods, the Tibetans of nearby Buka Village voluntarily organized to repair it, working with torches until late at night to complete the repairs. After the repairs were completed, they also established a method of assigning responsibility for long-term protection in sections. In the Tibetan Autonomous Region, there is also a story circulating: one evening, when a car broke down in the wilderness of Luhuo County, a strange Tibetan came and offered the driver butter tea and zanba; when it got dark, two more strangers, Tibetans carrying rifles, came to guard the car.

    藏族人民热心护卫康藏公路
    西康省藏族自治区内藏族人民积极参加康藏公路的养护和保卫工作。大批的藏民都自动要求作道班工人，他们当中许多已成为模范人物。如茨村和他的妻子或其他藏族道工常在寒冷的半夜里起来自动扫除公路上的积雪，有次他还一人捉住了三个破坏桥梁的坏分子。沿公路居住的藏族人民，也同样地自动护路，那里需要，他们就在那里出现。去年康定县的瓦泽桥被洪水冲毁了，许多藏民就自动从几十里路外背着帐篷和粮食前来抢修。一九五二年路孚县境内有一段公路被洪水冲坏，附近部卡村的藏民就自动组织起来抢修，他们打着火把一直到深夜才修好。修好后他们还订出大家分段负责，长期保护的办法。在藏族自治区内还流传着这样一个故事：有一辆汽车在炉霍县境内的荒野中抛锚了，傍晚，一个陌生的藏民走来把酥油和糌粑送给司机吃；天黑了，又走来两个不相识的背长枪的藏民守卫着汽车。（本报西康记者站）
