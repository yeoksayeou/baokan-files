Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 4th: Professor Priyono, Vice-Chairman of the Indonesian National Peace Committee, told the press on the 3rd that he was optimistic about the upcoming Asian-African Conference. He said that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence should be one of the basic issues discussed at the Asian-African Conference. He pointed out that unlike the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or the Manila Treaty Organization, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are based not on armed forces, but on genuine peaceful ideals.

He said that some governments outside the Asian-African region do not want to see Asian and African countries establish good relations with each other on a friendly basis, because such relations will strengthen the position of Asian and African countries, making them no longer play the role of being exploited that those countries outside the Asian-African region make them play.

Priyono hoped that all Asian and African countries would focus on the consistency of their common interests.

Lukman, Deputy Secretary-General of the Indonesian Communist Party, told the press on the 2nd that the results of the Bogor Conference were mainly reflected in the attitude against war and the efforts to strive for peace. The decisions of the Bogor Conference dealt a heavy blow to the war policy of the United States to drag Asian and African countries into its evil wars and aggression plans.

He said that the decision to convene the Asian-African Conference has given the Bogor Conference great international significance. The Asian-African Conference will mean the large-scale implementation of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the victory of peace and democratic forces.

On behalf of the members and supporters of the Indonesian Communist Party, Lukman expressed his support for the Bogor Conference and the Asian-African Conference, and called on the people of all countries invited to participate in the Asian-African Conference to urge their governments to approve the decisions of the Bogor Conference and send representatives to attend the Asian-African Conference.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 4th: "Indonesian News" published a commentary saying that the achievements of the Bogor Conference were the result of the growing anti-colonialist struggle. The decision of the Bogor Conference recognized that the growth of the People's Republic of China and its people is a contribution to world peace. The Bogor Conference also recognized the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as a growing force in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism.

"Indonesian News" pointed out that although the majority of people oppose war and strive for world peace, there is a smaller and smaller handful of people who still want to maintain their ruling position, even at the risk of war. In the struggle between these two trends, the forces of peace are growing and are defeating the forces of war.

"Indonesian Torch Daily" said that the Bogor Conference is a stepping stone for Asia and Africa on the historical road of creating their own history. This is the first time that Asian and African countries have planned and initiated a conference with the participation of thirty Asian and African countries to discuss their own problems.

The newspaper said that history will refute those Americans and others who attempt to diminish the significance of the Asian-African Conference. If the leaders of Asian and African countries can reflect the true aspirations of their people, and not the aspirations of others, Asian and African countries will be able to freely write their own history.

"Independence Daily" pointed out in a commentary that Western countries are very unhappy about the Bogor Conference. The newspaper said that it seems that Western countries still do not understand that Asia has embarked on a decisive historical stage. Western countries have always regarded Asia as a place to establish spheres of influence. For example, they established the so-called Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. When these countries saw that the major Asian countries all refused to participate in this organization and sought their own self-defense methods, they were extremely angry.

### 印度尼西亚公众和舆论支持召开亚非会议

    印度尼西亚公众和舆论支持召开亚非会议
   【新华社雅加达四日电】印度尼西亚全国和平委员会副主席普里约诺教授三日对报界发表谈话，对即将举行的亚非会议表示乐观。他说，五项共处原则应该是亚非会议上讨论的基本问题之一。他指出，和北大西洋公约组织或马尼拉条约组织不同，和平共处的五项原则并不是以武装力量，而是以真正的和平理想为基础。
    他说，亚非地区以外的某些政府不希望看到亚非国家在友好的基础上建立彼此之间的良好关系，因为这样的关系将会加强亚非国家的地位，使它们不再充当亚非地区以外的那些国家使它们充当的被榨取者的角色。
    普里约诺希望全体亚非国家着重于注意它们共同利益的一致性。
    印度尼西亚共产党副总书记鲁克曼二日对报界说，茂物会议的结果主要表现在反对战争的态度和争取和平的努力上。茂物会议的决定重重地打击了美国要把亚非国家拖入它的罪恶战争和侵略计划中去的战争政策。
    他说，召开亚非会议的决定已使茂物会议具有巨大的国际意义。亚非会议将意味着大规模地实行和平共处的五项原则以及和平和民主力量的胜利。
    鲁克曼代表印度尼西亚共产党的党员们和拥护者们表示支持茂物会议和亚非会议，并且号召所有被邀请参加亚非会议的国家的人民敦促他们的政府赞成茂物会议的决定，派代表出席亚非会议。
    【新华社雅加达四日电】“印度尼西亚新闻”发表评论说，茂物会议的成就是日益增长的反殖民主义斗争的结果。茂物会议的决定，承认了中华人民共和国和它的人民的成长是对世界和平的贡献。茂物会议还承认越南民主共和国是反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争中的日益壮大的力量。
      “印度尼西亚新闻”指出，虽然大多数人反对战争和争取世界和平，但是却有数目越来越少的一小撮人仍然要维持统治地位，甚至不惜冒战争的危险。在这两种趋势的斗争中，和平力量正在增长，而且正在击败好战力量。
    “印度尼西亚火炬报”说，茂物会议是亚洲和非洲在创造自己的历史的历史性道路上的踏脚石。亚非国家自己计划和发起有三十个亚非国家参加的会议来讨论它们自己的问题，这还是第一次。
    这家报纸说，历史将会驳斥那些企图缩小亚非会议意义的美国人和其他的人。如果亚非国家的领袖们能够反映他们本国人民的真正愿望，而不是反映旁人的愿望的话，亚非国家是能够自由地写下它们自己的历史的。
      “独立报”在评论中指出，西方国家对茂物会议感到很不高兴。这家报纸说，看来西方国家仍然没有了解，亚洲业已踏上决定性的历史阶段。西方国家一向把亚洲看作是建立势力范围的地方。例如，它们建立了所谓东南亚条约组织。当这些国家看到亚洲主要国家全都拒绝参加这个组织，并寻求它们自己的自卫办法时，它们就极其愤怒。
