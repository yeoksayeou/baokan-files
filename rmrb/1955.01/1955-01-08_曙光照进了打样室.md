	The Dawn Shines into the Sample Room
	Min Yong

	Many places staged the Soviet play "Dawn Over Moscow." It was well received by the audience. The audience welcomed it because it was educational. In terms of practical work, this play also had some positive effects. We don't know about other aspects, but let's talk about the printed fabric pattern design staff of the East China Textile Administration Bureau. They were directly inspired after watching this play. In order to strive for "the beauty of products" according to the principle of beauty, they went to various places to collect various new patterns as design references. This was originally a very good thing. It is also right to attract social attention to these new things. In order to report on this creative work, photography reporters from many newspapers in Shanghai came to the fabric pattern sample room one after another. The comrades in the sample room happily said, "The sample room is popular, and the dawn has shone in." Up to this point, everything was also very good.

	So, on August 30, 1953, a photo appeared in Shanghai's "Labor Daily." This photo was published on the left side of the masthead—the most eye-catching place in the newspaper—with the caption: "Art designers of the East China Textile Administration Bureau, referring to folk art, design more new patterns loved by the people." This photo was later reprinted in a pictorial issue of Beijing's "Workers' Daily." It can be seen that the photo was well taken. The picture shows close-ups of two designers. The one in front, or the main one, is a young girl with a braid draped over her shoulder. In front of her is a fabric pattern. She is holding a pen to draw. This photo does indeed give people a sense of beauty. Up to this point, if there was only this one photo, there wouldn't be anything too bad.

	However, after this, things became strange. As soon as the photography reporters arrived at the sample room, they looked for this "Little Braid." When "Little Braid" was not there, the photography reporters left with their cameras, as if all the old and young, men and women in the sample room were not worthy of being in the lens.

	In April 1954, a photography reporter from Shanghai's "Labor Daily" came again. This time, "Heaven does not disappoint those who work hard," and it happened that "Little Braid" was there. So the reporter got busy. He put the flowers he brought, asked "Little Braid" to change into a light green spring dress, and pulled open two desks, putting up an easel. It turned out that he wanted to take a photo of "Little Braid" sketching. This photo was published in the Shanghai "Labor Daily" on April 15, 1954. As expected, it was well taken, flowers, easel, a beautiful girl sketching, good sunlight shining in from the window... everything was there, it's just a pity that it wasn't a color photo, so you can't see that the dress is light green.

	After this, in the "Fabric" pictorial of the "Liberation Daily" on June 6, 1954, there was a close-up photo, also of this "Little Braid." She was holding a fabric pattern in one hand and a pen in the other, resting her chin in thought. Obviously, this photo was also carefully designed by the reporter. On July 23, 1954, the Shanghai "News Daily" also published a photo, and the central figure was still this "Little Braid." At the same time, a reflection article she wrote in support of the draft constitution was also published with the photo.

	The above is about the photos. In addition, there was news written by reporters who did not bring cameras. This news was published in the Shanghai "Labor Daily" on May 25, 1954, with the title:

	"Let the People Wear Beautiful and Colorful Fabrics
		Textile Administration Bureau Designers Design a Large Number of New Patterns"

	Although the title was written like this, the content was mostly praising the protagonist of those photos mentioned earlier. If there are achievements in work, why shouldn't they be praised? But the problem lies here, people who understand the situation cannot help but shake their heads.

	Let's start with those photos. There is one thing I forgot to mention earlier about the sketching photo in Shanghai's "Labor Daily" that was carefully arranged by the reporter, that is, the sketch on the easel. Originally, the sample room had not yet established a formal sketching plan. At that time, it was impossible to find a piece of sketching paper, so they had to temporarily find a checkers board, turned it over and used it as sketching paper, and the pattern on the paper was also drawn by another comrade. The person in the photo was just sitting there pretending. The pattern held by the person in the photo on the "Liberation Daily" resting her chin was also drawn by someone else, designed by a design worker with great achievements. At that time, the photography reporter also knew this, and also took a photo of the real designer of this pattern, but the newspaper did not publish it. Why was the photo of this design worker who had made significant achievements in her work not selected? Perhaps because she was older, the photography reporter and editor thought it was not in line with the "principle" of "beauty"?

	Unfortunately, their "principle" of "beauty" is not in line with the principle of the masses. The masses originally thought that if the people's newspaper wanted to praise a person, it should first start from their work. But these reporters did not do a good job of understanding the work situation of the object they wanted to photograph during the interview. So, now let us supplement according to the reflections of the masses: The masses said that she was undisciplined and lazy; when she was recruited to attend the Youth League class, she wanted to go to the railway station to see off friends; sometimes she attended the class, but read novels underneath; at the fabric and color cloth exhibition held by the Textile Union, she served as an explainer, but left the visitors aside and sat on a small stool, engrossed in reading novels; she was also not as active in design work as the newspaper said.

	We don't want to criticize this female comrade too much here. The problem lies with our reporters, those with cameras and those without cameras. If it weren't for those reporters, perhaps she would have realized her shortcomings more clearly and made faster progress. But she encountered such irresponsible and exaggerated flattery, which was precisely her misfortune. If some "big shots" are inevitably dizzy after listening to too many praises, then what about a young girl! The "dawn" brought by many photography reporters, like a spotlight, was concentrated on her, how could it not dazzle her?

### 曙光照进了打样室

    曙光照进了打样室
    敏永
    好多地方上演了苏联话剧“曙光照耀着莫斯科”。它受到了观众的欢迎。观众欢迎它，是因为它有教育意义。在实际工作方面，这个戏也发生了一些好的影响。别的方面我们不知道，只说华东纺织管理局的印花布花样设计工作人员吧，他们看了这个戏之后，就直接地受到启发。他们为了按着美的原则“为产品的美丽”而斗争，曾多方面地到各地去搜集各种新鲜的花样，作为设计上的参考。这原是很好的事。引起社会上注意这类新鲜事物，也是应该的。为了报道这一创造性的工作，上海的许多报纸的摄影记者纷纷来到了花布图案打样室。打样室的同志们高兴地说：“打样室红了，曙光照进来了。”到此为止，这也都是很好的事。
    于是一九五三年八月三十日上海“劳动报”上出现了一张照片。这张照片登在报头的左方——报纸最醒目的地方，它的说明是：“华东纺织管理局美术设计人员，参考了民间艺术品，设计更多人民喜爱的各种新花样。”这张照片，后来北京“工人日报”的一期画刊上边转载了。可见这张照片是照得不错的。画面上是两个设计人员的特写像，前面的一个，或者说主要的一个，是一位年青的姑娘，一条辫子搭在肩上，她的面前铺着一张花布的图案。她正在执笔描绘。这张照片的确给人以美的感觉。到此为止，如果只有这一张照片，也没有什么太不好的事。
    然而，这以后，事情就怪起来了。摄影记者一到打样室，就找这位“小辫子”，“小辫子”不在的时候，摄影记者提着照像机就走了，好像打样室里其他老老少少、男男女女都不堪入镜头似的。
    一九五四年四月，上海“劳动报”的摄影记者又来了。这次是“老天不负苦心人”，恰好“小辫子”在。于是这位记者就忙起来了。他把带来的鲜花摆上，又要“小辫子”换上一身浅绿色的春装，又拉开两张办公桌，摆上了画架，原来他是要给
  “小辫子”拍一张正在速写的照片。这张照片在一九五四年四月十五日的上海“劳动报”上登出来了。果然拍得不错，鲜花，画架，正在速写的美丽的姑娘，从窗子射进来的很好的阳光……应有尽有，只可惜不是彩色照片，看不出衣服是浅绿色的。
    这以后，在一九五四年六月六日“解放日报”的题为“花布”的画刊上，有一张特写照片，照的也是这位“小辫子”，她一手拿着花布的图样，一手持笔，托腮沉思。显然这张照片也是经过记者的一番匠心设计的。在一九五四年七月二十三日上海“新闻日报”上，也登着一张照片，其中的中心人物，仍然是这位“小辫子”。同时和照片在一起刊出的还有她写的一篇拥护宪法草案的感想文。
    上面说的是照片。此外，还有不带照像机的记者所写的新闻。这条新闻登于一九五四年五月二十五日的上海“劳动报”上，题目是：
    “让人民穿到美丽多采的花布
        纺管局设计人员设计大批新花样”
    题目虽是这样写的，可是内容却大半是表扬前面说的那些照片里的主角一个人的。工作如果有成绩，为什么不应该表扬呢？但问题就在这里，了解情况的人，都不能不摇头。
    也还是先就那些照片来说吧。上海“劳动报”上登的那张经过记者匠心安排的正在速写的照片，有一点前面忘记讲了，就是画架上的那张速写图样。原来，当时打样室还没有订出正规的写生计划，当时找张写生的纸也找不到，所以只好临时找了张跳棋盘，翻过来当做写生的纸，而纸上的图样，也是另一位同志画的，照片里的人不过坐在那里做做样子罢了。“解放日报”上登的那张托腮沉思的照片，照片里的人手里拿的图案，也是别人画的，那是一位工作很有成绩的设计工作者设计的。当时摄影记者对这一点也是知道的，同时也拍了这幅图样的真正设计者的照片，但报纸却没有登出。这位在工作中有显著成绩的设计工作者的照片为什么反倒没有被选中呢？也许因为她年纪大了些，摄影记者和编辑就认为不那么合于“美”的原则了吧？
    可惜，他们的这种“美”的“原则”，却和群众的原则不相符。群众原以为人民的报纸要表扬一个人，首先是要从他的工作出发的。但这几位记者们偏偏在采访时就没有很好地去了解他们所要拍照的对象的工作情况。那么，现在就让我们根据群众的反映来补充一下吧：群众说她自由散漫；吸收她上团课，她却要到火车站去送朋友；有时参加了听课，却在下面看小说；纺织工会举办花布色布展览会，她担任讲解员，却把参观的人撂在一旁不管，坐在小凳上入迷地读着小说；在设计工作上也不像报纸所说的那样积极。
    我们在这里并不想对这位女同志多所非难。问题在于我们那几位带着照像机和不带照像机的记者。如果不是碰到那几位记者，也许她会更清醒地认识到自己的缺点，进步会快些。可是她却碰到了那样不负责任的胡吹乱捧，这正是她倒楣的地方。倘如说某些“大人物”，听了过多的赞美歌，尚不免晕头涨脑，那么何况一个年青的女孩子！许多摄影记者带来的“曙光”，像聚光灯似地都集中到她身上，怎能不照得她眼花缭乱呢？
