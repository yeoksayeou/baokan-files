    History Must Not Be Allowed to Repeat Itself
    Ma Ke, Standing Director of the Chinese Musicians Association
    I spent the October Revolution Day of 1954 in Weimar, a famous city of culture and history in Germany. On this day, I experienced several things that I will never forget. Let me start with a few exciting pictures.
    I am not referring to the masterpieces of those great artists; no, this is not in an art gallery, this is in the exhibition room of the Buchenwald concentration camp ruins outside Weimar. The authors are some children who have just learned to use a pen. What are their names, where are they from, are they still alive now... These may be questions that can never be answered. But I still saw a photo, on which was a thin child, with two big eyes, as if asking: "Why do I have to wear this strange striped clothes?" His body was also tattooed with the words: "No. 67509". The photo was captioned: "Born on January 8, 1941, entered the concentration camp in August 1944". Perhaps this four-year-old child was one of the authors of those paintings. Let us take him as a representative, thinking that their fate is the same: they were all caught before they knew what hatred was; some of them may have been born in the concentration camp, and before they had breathed the air of freedom, they were thrown into the crematorium with their parents...
    How can this not make people feel particularly precious and painful about the relics of these short little lives!
    The first painting: a sailing boat is sailing on the boundless sea, and a huge sun is shining on it. I will not judge whether its author has artistic talent from these childish lines, but it attracted me to watch it again and again, and think deeply for a long time. Child, have you ever seen the sea? Are you recalling the unforgettable summer you spent with your parents on the beach, or did you hear the old uncle tell adventure stories at sea in the concentration camp, which aroused your fantasy of becoming a navigator? … I can't hear the child's answer, but it can be clearly seen from the painting that as a "person" – even if he is very young – he has the naive ambition. This ten-foot-high wire fence, twenty-two bunkers and the encirclement and suppression of an armored division of the concentration camp cannot eliminate a sprout of life's pursuit of life ideals and the desire for a free world. What a great comfort this gives to our human conscience! Another painting, perhaps created by the same author, depicts a mountain, with trees on the mountain, and two little girls with long braids carrying travel bags at the foot of the mountain. This mountain, trees and characters, like our common children's paintings, cannot be required by the principles of perspective; but from the steps taken by these two little travelers and their serious expressions, one cannot help but believe that what they are about to conquer are extremely steep mountains and forests full of mystery. Another painting: a building, next to which is a neat little garden, and a cat is lying on a stool – this is probably the child's home. How much imagination and nostalgia he has placed on every tree, every grass, and every window hole in the painting! The blank space on the drawing paper is filled with laboriously pieced together letters: "I don't have a sketchbook, I only have a small jacket, a button, let's leave here quickly..."
    I don't know how many young lives have been stifled in this concentration camp. Our guide said: A total of 250,000 people were imprisoned here from 1937 to 1945, and 56,000 of them sacrificed their lives. The bones of 56,000 people should be able to form a small mountain, but they all turned into green smoke from the crematorium! This crematorium, preserved as a historical testimony, is a killing machine representing fascist "culture". It has six furnace holes, each of which can just accommodate a small iron car carrying a corpse. The car has a mechanism that can automatically unload the corpse. It is completely burned in twenty minutes, and the furnace ash is crushed and sold as fertilizer. Under the crematorium is a basement – a living slaughterhouse: the first thing that catches the eye is the forty iron hooks installed on the wall, where people were hung and beaten to death alive. Then the executioners forced the living to take down the dead and hang themselves up again...
    Next to the crematorium is a dark room, in the middle of which is a cement thing like an operating table in a hospital. Fascist beasts performed their favorite surgery here – skinning people. The "prisoners" whose body shapes were a little different were always sent here, their internal organs were taken out and sold as specimens, and their skins were peeled off and tanned to make "handicrafts". One of the "handicrafts" favored by the fascist beasts – human skin lampshades – we already knew about. This time we saw it with our own eyes in the exhibition room. It is said that they like this kind of lampshade because human skin is thin and can make the light soft... Another "handicraft" is a human head shrunk to the size of a fist. This is a layer of skin peeled off from the head completely without damaging even a single hair, dried in hot air, and gradually shrunk. What we saw was an old man with his eyes tightly closed. He was inlaid with a base and placed on the desk of the concentration camp commander as a paperweight for appreciation.
    Human beings in uncivilized barbarian times often killed prisoners to celebrate victory; we also read some fairy tales when we were young, which told how the caves of man-eating demons were decorated with skulls... These terrifying stories gave children many nightmares. But in this century of ours, there are still some so-called "best and most civilized" "people" who have used the most "scientific" modern methods to restore the most barbaric atrocities. How this has trampled on our human self-esteem! How can this not make a person with basic dignity call them beasts!
    Our guide saw our indignation, and also understood that our indignation was not only caused by the remembrance of a historical relic, so he shrugged his shoulders and said with a bitter smile: "The inventor of this human skin product was a famous fascist female party member. In 1945, the Americans locked her up for a while, but she immediately had a child with the American soldier who was guarding her... Now she is the wife of a senior American officer in West Germany again."
    In 1945, American soldiers successfully occupied Weimar, but this concentration camp was not liberated by them. We saw some crude weapons in the exhibition room, like exhibits in a museum – pistols, grenades, bayonets, radios... The people imprisoned in the concentration camp used these self-made weapons to disarm the fascist SS and liberate themselves. When the vanguard of the American soldiers arrived, a huge portrait of Stalin had already been hung high on the gate of the concentration camp. This was painted overnight entirely from memory.
    The struggle in the concentration camp has never stopped. The struggle created miracles: under the bloody suppression and strict surveillance of the fascist beasts, people made three hundred grenades, seventy-five short guns and others. This was created by people using every possible opportunity to collect all available scrap metal. How much patience, how much labor and how much wisdom this requires! To give an example: an officer guarding the concentration camp liked to drink, so he ordered a chemist who was imprisoned to brew it for him. Every time this chemist made wine, he secretly brought out something... Soon, all their self-made grenades had explosives. This is indeed a miracle, but miracles are reasonable undertakings created by immortal people. Yes, concentration camp, concentration camp, how many noble people and wise people are imprisoned here! Which tyrant's prison in history has killed so many human essences like the fascist concentration camp! Hitler set up fifty-three concentration camps throughout Germany, but this Buchenwald (German for "Maple Forest") concentration camp was the earliest and most important. People especially remember this place because a great man sacrificed here: this person is the loyal son of the German people – Thälmann. In 1932, Comrade Thälmann participated in the election as the presidential candidate nominated by the Communist Party. He pointed out that Hitler was the agent of monopoly capitalists and that the working class should unite and not let the fascists seize power. However, the German Social Democratic Party played a trick at the time, and they called out: "Down with Hitler, elect Hindenburg"! The Communist Party warned: "Electing Hindenburg is equivalent to electing Hitler! Don't elect Hindenburg, elect Thälmann!" But the German people were deceived; Hindenburg was elected president, and he immediately appointed Hitler as prime minister. In 1935, Hitler signed an agreement with British Prime Minister Baldwin, allowing Germany to rearm... As a result, the profits of the German Farben Company increased from 48 million marks in 1932 to 822.2 million marks (1943), and mankind suffered this catastrophe that we have witnessed with our own eyes.
    Comrade Thälmann was arrested after Hitler came to power and spent more than eleven years in prison. In 1944, in the frenzy of his death throes, the fascists escorted Comrade Thälmann here and shot him, and the body was sent to the crematorium. Ten years have passed, Hitler stinks like a pile of dirt in Berlin, while the place where Comrade Thälmann sacrificed is filled with wreaths offered by constant visitors all year round, and is always fragrant.
    Let the rubble in these concentration camp ruins speak! Let the maple forest around it speak! They are all iron historical witnesses. The time that has passed is not long. Today, some noble gentlemen have expressed no interest in reviewing this history, and hope that the people will quickly forget the past. But the people will not forget history; history will not forget these gentlemen either.
    History must not be allowed to repeat itself! – Everyone we met during our visit to Democratic Germany: the old professor at the Leipzig Conservatory of Music, the construction worker on Stalin Avenue in Berlin, the young nanny in the nursery of the Agfa factory guarding the sleeping babies, the breeder of the "Forward Agricultural Production Cooperative"... They all expressed the same idea: History must not be allowed to repeat itself! Everything we saw in Germany: the ruins of Dresden burying 200,000 refugees, the stone sculpture of the Muse goddess knocked down by a bomb in the Augustus the Great Palace, the bronze statues of Schiller and Goethe in front of the Weimar Opera House gazing forward with sharp eyes and deep sympathy... all seemed to be saying: History must not be allowed to repeat itself! Yes, for the cause of Thälmann, for the old man with his eyes tightly closed and the four-year-old child numbered 67509, we must never let history repeat itself!
    Only in the direction where the sun is setting, there is a small handful of people who want to reverse the wheels of history and repeat the path that Hitler took twenty years ago. They unreservedly repeat the words spoken by their predecessors, such as the "threat of communism", rearmament, and unification by force... But today is no longer 1933, and the German people of today are not the German people of that time. If those people must drag history backward, they will never find the ending they deserve any slower or better than their predecessors!

### 不能让历史重演

    不能让历史重演
    中国音乐家协会常务理事　马可
    一九五四年十月革命节我是在德国的文化历史名城魏玛度过的。这一天我经历了好几件终生难忘的事情。这里让我先从几幅激动人心的图画说起吧。
    我不是指那些美术大师的杰作；不，这不是在美术馆，这是在魏玛郊外布痕瓦尔德集中营遗址的陈列室里。作者是一些刚刚会使用笔的孩子。他们叫什么名字，哪里人，现在是否还活着……这些也许是永远无法回答的问题了。但我还是看到了一张照片，上面是一个瘦小的孩子，睁着两只大眼，像是在问：“为什么要我穿这奇怪的宽条纹衣服？”他的身上也被刺着字：“六七五○九号”。照片下面注明：“一九四一年一月八日生，一九四四年八月进集中营”。也许这个四岁的孩子就是那些画的作者之一。我们不妨以他来作为代表吧，想来他们的命运是相同的：都是在还不懂得什么是仇恨的时候就被抓了进来；其中也许有的就诞生在集中营里，还没有呼吸过自由的空气就随着他们的父母一道被投进了焚尸炉……
    这怎能不使人对这些短促的小生命的遗物感到特别珍贵和沉痛！
    第一幅画：一只帆船在无边大海上航行，一个巨大的太阳照着它。我不会从这些稚气的线条判断它的作者是不是有美术天才，但它吸引住我看了又看，深思很久。孩子啊，你见过海吗？你是在回想和爸爸妈妈在海滨度过的难忘的夏天呢，还是在集中营里听到老伯伯讲海上的探险故事以后引起了你要做一个航海家的幻想？……我听不到孩子的回答，但从画上可以清楚地看到作为一个“人”——哪怕他很幼小——的天真志向。这集中营的一丈高的电网、二十二个碉堡和一个装甲师的包围和镇压，却无法消灭一棵生命的嫩芽对于生活理想的追求，对于自由天地的渴望，这给予我们人类的良心以多大的安慰！另一幅，也许是同一作者的创作，画了一座山，山上有树，山下有两个背着旅行囊的长辫子小姑娘。这山、树和人物如我们常见的儿童画一样，是无法用透视学的原理来要求的；但从这两个小旅行家迈开的脚步和认真的神情来看，人不能不相信她们将要征服的是险峻无比的高山和充满神秘气氛的森林。再一幅：一幢楼房，旁边有一个整齐的小花园，猫儿卧在凳子上——这大约是孩子的家园吧。他对画上的每棵树、每根草、每扇窗洞都寄托了多少想像和留恋呀！画纸的空白地方写着吃力地拼起来的字母：“我没有速写本子，我只有一个小褂、一个钮扣，我们快些离开这里吧……”
    我不知道这个集中营里曾经扼杀过多少幼小的生命。我们的解说员说：从一九三七年到一九四五年先后被囚在这里的共二十五万人，其中五万六千人牺牲了性命。五万六千人的白骨该能堆成一座小山吧，但他们都化成了焚尸炉上的青烟！这焚尸炉，作为历史的见证被保存下来，这是代表法西斯“文化”的杀人机器。它有六个炉孔，每孔恰能容进装载一个尸体的小铁车，车上有机械能将尸体自动卸下，二十分钟便完全烧掉，炉灰被捣碎后当成肥田粉出卖。焚尸炉的下面是一个地下室——活屠场：首先引人注意的是安装在墙上的四十个铁钩子，人们被挂在这里活活打死，然后刽子手们逼着活人将死者解下再自己吊上去……
    焚尸炉旁有一间阴暗的屋子，中间有一个水泥的像医院里手术台一样的东西，法西斯野兽在这里施行他们爱好的手术——剥人。“囚徒”们中身体形状有点不同的人总免不了被送到这里来，他们的内脏被取出卖掉做标本，他们的皮被剥下硝好制成“工艺品”。法西斯野兽爱好的“工艺品”之一——人皮灯罩——是我们早已知道的了，这次在陈列室内亲眼看见了它。据说，它们爱好这种灯罩是因为人皮细而薄，可使灯光柔和……另一种“工艺品”是一个缩小得像拳头大的人头，这是从人的头上被完整得连一根汗毛也没有损伤地剥下来的一层皮，放在热空气里干燥、渐渐缩小做成的。我们看到的是一个紧闭双目的老者，他被镶上底座放在集中营长官的办公桌上当作镇纸来赏玩。
    人类在未开化的野蛮时代常残杀俘虏庆贺胜利；我们在小时也都读过一些童话，上面讲到吃人妖魔的山洞里怎样装饰着骷髅……这些恐怖的故事使孩子们做了多少恶梦啊。可是在我们这一世纪，还有一些自称为“最优秀最文明”的“人”，他们用最“科学”的现代方法恢复了最野蛮的兽行。这是怎样蹂躏了我们人类的自尊心！这又怎能不使一个有着起码的尊严的人把它们叫作野兽！
    我们的解说员看出了我们的愤慨，而且也了解我们并不是仅仅由于凭吊一种历史陈迹而引起的愤慨，因而耸耸两肩，苦笑着说：“这人皮制作品的发明人是一个著名的法西斯女党棍，一九四五年美国人把她关了一下，但她马上就和看守她的美国兵生了一个孩子……现在她又作了西德一位美国高级军官的太太。”
    一九四五年美国兵顺利地占领了魏玛，但这集中营却不是他们解放的。我们看到陈列室中一些粗糙的、像博物馆里的展品一样的武器——手枪、手榴弹、刺刀、收音机……被囚在集中营里的人用这些亲手制造的武器将法西斯党卫军缴械，解放了自己。当美国兵的先头部队到来时，集中营的大门上已经高悬起巨幅斯大林像，这是人们完全凭着记忆在一夜中间赶画出来的。
    集中营里从来没有停止过斗争，斗争创造了奇迹：在法西斯野兽血腥的镇压和严密的监视下的人们造出了三百个手榴弹，七十五枝短枪及其他。这是人们利用一切可能的机会搜集一切可以利用的破铜烂铁造成的。这要多大的耐心，多少的劳动和多高的智慧！举一个例子：看守集中营的一个军官爱喝酒，他命令一个被囚禁的化学家来给他酿造。这化学家每次作酒时偷偷地带出一些什么……不久，所有他们自制的手榴弹里就有了炸药。这的确是奇迹，但奇迹是不朽的人们所创造的合理的事业。是啊，集中营，集中营，这里囚禁了多少高尚的人，智慧的人！历史上哪一个暴君的牢狱像法西斯的集中营囚杀了这么多人类的菁华！希特勒在全德国设立了五十三个集中营，但这布痕瓦尔德（德文意为“枫林”）的集中营是最早和最重要的一个。人们都因这里牺牲过一个伟大的人而特别记住这地方：这个人便是德国人民忠实的儿子——台尔曼。一九三二年台尔曼同志作为共产党提出的总统候选人参加竞选，他指出：希特勒是独占资本家的代理人，工人阶级要团结起来，不要让法西斯取得政权。但是当时的德国社会民主党耍了一个花招，他们号召：“打倒希特勒，选举兴登堡”！共产党警告说：“选举兴登堡等于选希特勒！不要选兴登堡，选举台尔曼”！但是德国人民受了欺骗；兴登堡当选了总统，他马上委任希特勒为内阁总理。一九三五年希特勒与英国首相包尔温签订协定，允许德国重整军备……于是德国法本公司的利润从一九三二年的四千八百万马克增加到八亿二千二百万马克（一九四三年），而人类遭到了我们亲眼看见的这一场浩劫。
    台尔曼同志在希特勒上台后被捕，在监狱里过了十一年多。一九四四年，法西斯在垂死前的疯狂挣扎中将台尔曼同志押到这里枪杀，尸体送进焚尸炉。十年过去了，希特勒臭了柏林的一堆土，而台尔曼同志牺牲的地方却摆满了终年不断的参观者所献的花圈，永远散放着芳香。
    让这些集中营废墟中的瓦砾讲话吧！让这周围的枫林讲话吧！它们都是铁的历史见证。时间过去的并不久，今天已经有一些高贵的先生们表示没有兴趣回顾这段历史，并且希望人民也快快地忘记过去的事情。但是人民是不会忘记历史的；历史也不会忘记这些先生们。
    不能让历史重演！——在我们访问民主德国期间所遇到的每一个人：来比锡音乐院的老教授，柏林斯大林大街的建筑工人，矮克发工厂托儿所里守在酣睡的婴儿旁边的年轻保姆，“前进农业生产合作社”的饲养员……他们都表示着同一的意念：不能让历史重演！我们在德国所看到的一切：德累斯顿埋葬着二十万难民的废墟，奥古士都大帝宫殿被炸弹击倒的缪斯女神的石雕，魏玛歌剧院门前以锋锐的眼光和深厚的同情注视着前方的席勒和歌德的铜像……也都似乎在说：不能让历史重演！是啊，为了台尔曼的事业，为了那紧闭双目的老人和那六七五○九号的四岁孩子，我们决不能让历史重演！
    只有在那太阳没落的方向，有那么一小撮人想扭转历史的车轮，想重复希特勒在二十年前走过的道路。他们毫不避讳地重复他们的先辈讲过的话，什么“共产党的威胁”呀，重新武装呀，武力统一呀……可是今天已经不是一九三三年，今天的德国人民也不是那个时候的德国人民了。如果那些人一定要拖着历史倒退的话，他们决不会比他们的先辈们更慢和更好地找到应得的归宿！
