    Eliminate the Bandit Chiang, Avenge the Blood Debt
    On January 19th, Chiang bandit air force, piloting American planes, intruded into the Shantou and nearby areas of Guangdong Province, strafing and bombing peaceful residents, killing and wounding more than 40 residents, and damaging 14 merchant ships and fishing boats. The British merchant ship "Zheng Weijian," berthed in Shantou, was also sunk. Our heroic anti-aircraft artillery units dealt a heavy blow to the intruding Chiang bandit planes, shooting down four Chiang bandit F-47 aircraft and damaging four more of the same type. On the 20th, Chiang bandits again used twelve sorties of American-supplied F-84 jet aircraft to intrude into the urban area of Fuzhou in batches, bombing and wounding more than 300 peaceful residents of Fuzhou and destroying more than 4,000 civilian houses. We are filled with boundless anger at this new heinous crime of the Chiang bandits and must continue to strengthen the struggle to liberate Taiwan and avenge our dead compatriots!
    This atrocity of the Chiang bandits using American planes to indiscriminately bomb peaceful residents of Shantou and Fuzhou occurred after the so-called US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" was signed, and the United States intensified its supply of naval and air force equipment to the Chiang bandits. It was actively encouraged and supported by the American aggressor bloc. This nakedly exposes the lie that the US-Chiang treaty is "purely defensive in nature." The US-Chiang treaty is for the purpose of expanding aggression against China and preparing for a new war.
    The fact that the Chiang bandits used American planes to indiscriminately bomb Shantou and Fuzhou once again shows that: as long as the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, directly supported by the American aggressor bloc, is not eliminated, and Taiwan is not liberated, the environment for our peaceful construction will constantly be threatened, and peace in Asia and the world will not be guaranteed. Therefore, the people of our country must fully support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan. The People's Liberation Army, bearing the glorious mission, must intensify training, intensify vigilance, and be highly vigilant against the enemy's conspiracies. The coastal land, sea, and air forces must further improve their combat capabilities in actual combat, fight bravely, and resolutely struggle to completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, liberate our sacred territory of Taiwan, and defend peace in the Far East and Asia.

### 消灭蒋贼，讨还血债

    消灭蒋贼，讨还血债
    本月十九日，蒋贼空军驾驶美国的飞机，窜扰我广东汕头及其附近地区，向和平居民投弹扫射，炸死炸伤居民四十余人，炸伤商船和渔船十四艘，停泊汕头的英国商船“正伟健号”也被炸沉。我英勇的高射炮部队给窜扰的蒋贼机以沉重打击，击落蒋贼F—四七型飞机四架，击伤同型飞机四架。二十日，蒋贼又以美国最近交给它的F—八四型喷气飞机十二架次分批窜入我福州市区，炸死炸伤福州市和平居民三百余人、炸毁民房四千余间。我们怀着对于蒋贼这种新的滔天暴行的无比愤怒，一定要继续加强解放台湾的斗争，为死难同胞复仇！
    这一次蒋贼以美国飞机滥炸汕头、福州和平居民的暴行，正是发生在所谓美蒋“共同防御条约”签了字，美国加紧以海空军装备交给蒋贼之后。它是受到美国侵略集团的积极鼓励和支持的。这就赤裸裸地暴露了美蒋条约是“纯防御性质”的谎言。美蒋条约就是为了扩大对中国的侵略，就是为了准备新战争。
    蒋贼以美国飞机滥炸汕头、福州的事实，又一次地表明：在美国侵略集团直接支持下的蒋介石卖国集团一天不消灭，台湾一天不解放，我国的和平建设环境就经常受着威胁，亚洲和世界和平就得不到保障。因此，我们全国人民必须全力支援人民解放军解放台湾。肩负着光荣任务的人民解放军必须加紧训练，加紧戒备，高度警惕敌人的阴谋。沿海的陆海空军部队，必须在实战中更加提高作战能力，奋勇战斗，为彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团，解放我国神圣领土台湾、保卫远东和亚洲的和平而坚决斗争。
