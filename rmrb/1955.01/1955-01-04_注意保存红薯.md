Recently, some areas have experienced sweet potato cellars flooding, collapsing, and sweet potatoes rotting and freezing due to rain and snow. According to statistics from eighteen counties and cities in the four special districts of Xuchang, Xinyang, Shangqiu, and Nanyang in Henan Province, 75,150 sweet potato cellars have flooded, and 7,657 have collapsed. In Xuchang, Yanling, and Shangcai counties, more than 640,000 jin of sweet potatoes have already spoiled or are about to spoil. Some areas in Anhui Province have also experienced sweet potatoes freezing. In Woyang County alone, according to incomplete statistics, more than 2.55 million jin of sweet potatoes have been frozen.

Sweet potatoes are a popular food among the Chinese people. In areas that suffered floods last year, they are the main food source for the local people. The quality of sweet potato preservation has a great impact on solving the current living problems of the disaster-stricken people and overcoming the spring famine this year.

In order to reduce sweet potato losses, various places in Henan Province are actively carrying out rescue work. Xihua County organized more than 200 county and district cadres to go deep into the disaster areas to specifically carry out this work. Fugou County had 45.87 million jin of sweet potatoes submerged in water. The county adopted methods such as dividing the sweet potatoes among the masses for consumption, cutting and drying sweet potato slices, changing cellars, and grinding flour. In two days, more than 27.55 million jin were rescued.

In order to earnestly solve this problem, all localities should immediately organize cadres to go deep into the countryside and lead farmers to conduct a comprehensive inspection of sweet potato cellars. Sweet potato cellars that are not waterproof and cold-proof should be repaired; sweet potato cellars that have collapsed or accumulated water should be rescued immediately. According to past experience, the following are some ways to rescue waterlogged sweet potatoes: (1) Cut and dry sweet potato slices; (2) Mobilize the local masses to share and consume the sweet potatoes, and slowly return them later; (3) Grind into flour for storage; (4) Use relief funds to appropriately purchase a portion to relieve disaster victims.

    注意保存红薯
    最近有些地区，因天降雨雪，发生了红薯窖上水、倒塌和红薯腐烂冻坏的现象。据河南省许昌、信阳、商邱、南阳四个专区十八个县市的统计，红薯窖上水的有七万五千一百五十个，已倒塌七千六百五十七个；许昌、鄢陵、上蔡三县已坏或将坏的红薯有六十四万多斤。安徽省有些地区也发生了红薯冻坏现象，仅涡阳一县，据不完全统计，就冻坏红薯二百五十五万多斤。
    红薯是我国人民喜爱的一种食物。在去年遭受水灾地区，更是当地人民目前的主要食粮。红薯保存的好坏，对灾区人民解决当前生活问题和渡过今年的春荒，都有很大关系。
    为了减少红薯损失，河南省各地正积极进行抢救。西华县组织县、区干部二百多人深入灾区，专门进行这个工作。扶沟县有四千五百八十七万斤红薯被水浸湿，该县采用群众分吃、切晒薯片、换窖、磨粉等办法，两天内就抢救出二千七百五十五万多斤。
    为了认真解决这个问题，各地应立即组织干部，深入农村，领导农民对红薯窖进行一次普遍检查。红薯窖不能防水和御寒的，应加以修缮；红薯窖已经倒塌或积水的，要立即进行抢救。根据历年的经验，抢救被水浸湿的红薯的办法有以下几种：（一）切晒红薯片；（二）发动当地群众分吃，以后慢慢归还；（三）磨粉贮存；（四）用救济款适当购买一部分来救济灾民。
