    Winter Production of Oroqen Women
    This winter, the Oroqen National Pioneer Agricultural and Hunting Cooperative in Xunke County, Heilongjiang Province, has hunted many roe deer. Every household's yard is filled with the peeled roe deer skins. The Oroqen women are busily sewing the tanned skins into many leather pants, gloves, and so on. In the past, during the winter hunting season, Oroqen women had to follow the men up the mountains, braving blizzards and freezing weather. Now that they have settled down, while the men go hunting, the women can work on tanning and sewing the skins in warm and clean wooden houses. They use red and green threads to embroider simple and beautiful patterns on the dyed black skins, demonstrating the rich and diverse handicraft art characteristics of the Oroqen people. Zhu, an elderly woman in her fifties, wearing reading glasses, sits in front of the glass window, sewing roe deer skin pants stitch by stitch with fine threads made of roe deer tendons. This winter, she has already earned more than 600,000 yuan. They have collectively earned more than 17.7 million yuan and have used the money to purchase many daily necessities.

    鄂伦春族妇女的冬季生产
    黑龙江省逊克县鄂伦春民族先锋农猎生产合作社，今冬打了很多狍子，每家院子里都挂满着剥下的狍子皮张，鄂伦春族的妇女们正在紧张地将熟好的皮张缝成许多皮裤、手套等。过去，鄂伦春族妇女在冬季狩猎时，都要跟着男人冒着暴风寒雪一起上山，现在定居后，男人去狩猎，她们就可以在温暖干净的木房里进行晒熟和缝制皮张的工作。她们用红绿色线往染黑了的皮张上扎着朴素美丽的花样，表现出了鄂伦春民族丰富多采手工艺术的特点。五十多岁的朱老太太戴着老花镜坐在玻璃窗前，把狍子筋搓成的细线绳一针一针的缝制着狍皮裤，今冬她缝制的东西已收入六十多万元。她们共已收入一千七百多万元，并用这些钱添买了很多生活用品。
