    Investigation of the Ideological Situation of Members of Twenty-Six Agricultural Production Cooperatives in Hebei Province
    Collective Investigation
    Written by Han Zhizhong
    We investigated the reasons for joining cooperatives among 1,237 member households in twenty-six agricultural cooperatives in villages such as Beipengzhuang in Jin County, Dagudian in Mancheng County, Kuanzhang in She County, and Huining in Xingtai County, Hebei Province. According to our understanding, the reasons for members joining the cooperatives can be divided into the following three categories:
    The first category: those who joined the cooperative voluntarily and actively, totaling 494 households, accounting for 40% of the total number of members in the twenty-six cooperatives. The vast majority of these people are Party members, Youth League members, village cadres, mutual aid team leaders, youth, and peasants who had difficulties in production and life after the liberation. They have a high level of awareness, firmly support the Party's call, and can play a leading role in various tasks. They have personally experienced that Chairman Mao's words are correct, and the Communist Party will not lead them down the wrong path; therefore, they actively participated from the beginning of the establishment of the cooperative, and most of them can also mobilize others. For example, Li Yuzhen, a new middle peasant in Beipengzhuang Cooperative in Jin County, has a family of two, seven mu of land, and strong labor. He was originally the leader of a mutual aid team; the year before last, there was a drought, and there was no well to irrigate the land, and the production of cotton and grain was reduced. Last year, he voluntarily signed up to join the cooperative and actively mobilized the entire mutual aid team to join the cooperative. After joining the cooperative, these people are active in production and care about the cooperative, and most of them have become active members and backbones of running the cooperative.
    The second category: those who joined the cooperative by "following the crowd." This can be further divided into two types:
    A. Basically voluntary, 402 households, accounting for 32% of the total number of members in the twenty-six cooperatives. These people do not have great difficulties in production and life. Their performance during the establishment of the cooperative was: joining is okay, not joining is also okay, hesitant; but seeing that everyone else has joined the cooperative, they also signed up. After joining the cooperative, generally speaking, their thinking is easily volatile, they are active when they benefit, and they become emotional when things don't go well. Among them, there is a type of person who says: there is no difficulty in not joining the cooperative, but there is glory to be gained by joining. For example, Feng Bingyuan of Qiankuanzhang Cooperative in She County is an old middle peasant with a family of five, fifteen mu of good land, two laborers, a mule, and complete farm tools. He has always been "doing whatever is popular," so he joined the cooperative when others did; his income increased last year, and his mood is very high. There is also a type of person who lives a very "comfortable" life and did not want to join the cooperative, but joined after being mobilized by others, and does not feel that they are suffering losses after joining the cooperative. For example, Xu Shuangzheng (an old middle peasant) of Beipengzhuang Cooperative in Jin County has a family of six, twenty-one mu of land, and three laborers. His son is a member of the Youth League, and the cadres persuaded him to join the cooperative, so he joined; his performance after joining the cooperative was active, and his income also increased. He said: "I should have joined the cooperative earlier." Another type is dissatisfied if they don't get any benefits, but they don't withdraw from the cooperative either. For example, Zhang Hezi of Beipengzhuang Cooperative in Jin County is an old middle peasant with a family of seven, fourteen mu of land, two laborers, and a donkey. He joined the cooperative neither early nor late. During the four evaluations, he felt that his labor points were rated too low, complained that the fertilizer sold to the cooperative was priced too low, and complained that the truck was too full when loading (fertilizer was priced by the truckload), but he did not withdraw from the cooperative.
    B. Those who joined the cooperative reluctantly because they were somewhat "afraid," totaling 254 households, accounting for just over 20% of the total number of members in the twenty-six cooperatives. A concrete analysis can be divided into the following types: (1) Those who own more and better means of production are afraid of suffering losses by joining the cooperative, but they are "afraid" of being isolated if they don't join, and they are also "afraid" of being labeled as backward, so they joined. After joining the cooperative, they often find fault with the cooperative and act obstinately. For example, Ning Luoyu of Dagudian Cooperative in Mancheng County is an old middle peasant with a family of thirteen, thirty mu of land, one laborer, and complete vehicles, horses, and farm tools. He used to participate in a mutual aid team; when the entire team transferred to the cooperative, he originally did not understand the idea, but he was "afraid" that others would say he was backward if he did not join, and he was also "afraid" of being classified as landlords and rich peasants who were not wanted by the cooperative, so he joined the team. Then, he also depreciated the new rubber-tired cart he had just bought and gave it to the cooperative, so he was very dissatisfied in his heart, but he did not propose to withdraw from the cooperative, so he held a bellyful of anger and made trouble for the cooperative, even asking the cooperative for money when buying vinegar. (2) They were unwilling at heart, but joined the cooperative after being persuaded, and then regretted it after joining. For example, Peng Xinli of Beipengzhuang Cooperative in Jin County has a family of two, half a laborer, and eleven mu of land, and owns shares (with others) in water wheels, carts, and livestock. At first, he was afraid of suffering losses and did not join the cooperative; after being persuaded by the village cadres, his brother (who is a cadre in another place) also told him: "You won't be spared sooner or later, it's better to join early and get some benefits." Only then did he sign up. In the first half of the year, he only cared about working to earn work points, and his labor was okay; after calculating in the autumn, he thought he might suffer a little loss, so he became emotional and wanted to withdraw from the cooperative several times, and asked the cooperative cadres, "Is there any crime for withdrawing from the cooperative?" (3) They would not suffer any losses by joining the cooperative, but they were "afraid" of suffering losses because they did not understand the situation. For example, Peng Xia盆 of Beipengzhuang Cooperative in Jin County is an old middle peasant with a family of eight, seventeen mu of land, three laborers, a mule, and incomplete carts and farm tools; he didn't like that he couldn't go to the fields early even when the cooperative was busy. When absorbing new members, the in-depth explanation and concrete accounting work was not done well, so he was a little "afraid" at first and didn't want to join the cooperative. Later, he thought: "Everyone else has joined, so I'll go in and try it out." So he joined the cooperative. After joining the cooperative, he was not active in production, picked easy work, and only complained that the work points were rated too low. (4) Neighbors or landowners have all joined the cooperative, or water wheels, livestock, and sideline production are jointly owned with others. If others have joined the cooperative, they will also join. For example, Xu Zhenbang of Beipengzhuang Cooperative in Jin County is an old middle peasant with only one person in his family (fifty years old), with twelve mu of land, of which eight mu of paddy fields are in three pieces, surrounded by land belonging to cooperative members. If he does not join the cooperative, it will be inconvenient to cultivate, deliver manure, and it will be difficult to work alone, and he is even more "afraid" of being transferred to bad land in the future, so he joined the cooperative. He kept four mu of land for himself, and did not go to the cooperative to work for a year; he went to the cooperative to withdraw money before the accounts were settled in the autumn, and he was dissatisfied when he didn't get it. (5) Childless, elderly, weak, and labor-deficient households, and a few carpenters, plasterers, etc. who do small businesses and have skills. In the past, these people relied on relatives and neighbors to "help each other" or "hire laborers" to farm. Now that everyone else has joined the cooperative, they have to sign up as well.
    The third category is those who were "invited" in or "mixed" in, totaling 87 households, accounting for 7% of the total number of members in the twenty-six cooperatives. Those who were "invited" in were mostly those with strong livestock, farm tools, and land, or those who could write and calculate. For example, Yang Manchang, a member of Yangjiashan Village Cooperative in She County, is an old middle peasant with two strong laborers, twelve mu of good land, and a large mule. His management skills are unmatched by ordinary people; he joined the cooperative only after repeated mobilization by the cadres; he is not active after joining the cooperative. Those who "mixed" in are landlords, rich peasants, and leaders of secret societies. For example, Xu Xiaoyu and other ten households in Beipengzhuang Cooperative in Jin County were originally a large household with more than two qing of land, four or five livestock, three or four of their own laborers, and three or four short-term laborers in busy times, sometimes as many as thirty or forty. During the land reform, they were divided into more than one qing of land. One member of this family is now in Taiwan, one served as a puppet county magistrate, and one served as a soldier in the Kuomintang army. Now they have been divided into ten households, two of whom were detained for one or two years respectively in 1950 for injuring the eye of a cadre. When the cooperative was established, they found a way to join the cooperative; after joining the cooperative, they did not actively work, and they attacked whoever was active. Last autumn, several of their brothers injured the production team leader due to work point issues.
    From these twenty-six cooperatives, it can be seen that the better the ideological education work and the better the implementation of the class policy, the greater the proportion of those who joined voluntarily, the fewer those who joined reluctantly, and there were no those who "mixed" in or were "invited" in. For example, in the two cooperatives in Cicun, She County, the ideological mobilization work was done relatively well during the establishment of the cooperatives; of the 62 households in the two cooperatives, 36 were completely voluntary, accounting for 58%; 17 were basically voluntary, accounting for 27%; and 9 joined reluctantly, accounting for just over 14%. In cooperatives where the ideological mobilization work was poorly done, such as one cooperative in Nanzhuang, She County, with a total of 35 households, those who were completely voluntary accounted for 31%; those who were basically voluntary accounted for 44%; and those who joined reluctantly accounted for 25%.

    河北省二十六个农业生产合作社社员思想情况调查
    集体调查
    韩治中执笔
    我们在河北省晋县北彭庄、满城县大固店、涉县宽漳和邢台县会宁等村，调查了二十六个农业社的一千二百三十七户社员的入社思想。据我们了解，社员的入社思想可分以下三种：
    第一种，自愿而且积极地加入合作社的，四百九十四户，占二十六个社的社员总数的百分之四十。这一部分人，绝大部分是党员、团员、村干部、互助组长、青年，和生产上生活上有困难的翻身户。他们觉悟较高，对党的号召坚决拥护，在各种工作中能起带头作用。他们亲身体会到毛主席的话没有错，共产党不会往错路上领他们；因此，一开始建社就积极参加，其中多数人并且能动员别人。如晋县北彭庄社新中农李玉振，家有两口人，七亩地，劳力很强，原是互助组长；前年天旱，没井浇不上水，棉花、谷子都减产了，去年他就自动报名入社，并积极动员互助组全组都入了社。这部分人入社后，生产积极，对社关心，大都成了办社的积极分子和骨干。
    第二种，是“随大流”入社的。这里边又可以分两种：
    甲、基本上自愿的，四百零二户，占二十六个社的社员总数的百分之三十二。这种人在生产上和生活上没有很大困难，建社时的表现是：入也可，不入也行，犹豫不定；但见大家都入社了，自己也跟着报了名。他们入社后，一般地说思想容易波动，沾了便宜就积极，不顺心就闹情绪。其中有一种人是：不入社没困难，入了有光沾。如涉县前宽漳社冯秉元，是老中农，家有五口人，十五亩好地，两个劳力，一头骡子，农具齐全，为人老实忠厚，从来是“兴啥干啥”，所以别人入社他也入社；去年收入增加，情绪很高。还有一种人是：日子过得很“自在”，本不想入社，但经人动员后参加了，入了社也不觉得吃亏。如晋县北彭庄社许双正（老中农），家有六口人，二十一亩地，三个劳力，儿子是团员，干部们劝他入社，他就入了社；入社后表现积极，收入也增加了。他说：“咱早该入社。”另一种是沾不上光就不满意，但也不出社。如晋县北彭庄社张合子，是老中农，家有七口人，十四亩地，两个劳力，一头驴，不早也不晚地入了社，四评时认为自己的劳力分评的低，嫌卖给社里的肥料作价小，装车时又嫌装的满（肥料是论车作价的），但又不出社。
    乙、因为有些“怕”而勉强入社的，二百五十四户，占二十六个社的社员总数的百分之二十强。具体地分析一下，又可以分为以下几种：（1）占有生产资料较多较好，入社怕吃亏，不入“怕”孤立，又“怕”说落后，就入了。入社后常对社找毛病，耍蹩气。如满城县大固店社宁洛雨，是老中农，家有十三口人，三十来亩地，一个劳动力，车、马、农具都齐全。过去参加互助组；全组转社时，他本来思想没有通，但不入又“怕”别人说落后，又“怕”和合作社不要的地主、富农等列为一类人，就随组转入了社；接着，又把刚买的新胶皮车也折价归了社，因此，内心很不满意，但又不提出退社，蹩一肚子气，就给社里找麻烦，买点醋也到社里去要钱。（2）本心不愿意，经人劝说后入了社，入社后又后悔。如晋县北彭庄社彭新立，家有两口人，半个劳动力，种着十一亩地，水车、大车、牲口都有股（和别人伙的），最初怕吃亏，不入社；经村干部劝说，他兄弟（在外当干部）也告诉他：“迟早饶不了，早入还有便宜。”他才报了名。前半年，他只顾做活赚工分，劳动还可以；秋后一计算可能有点吃亏，就闹情绪，几次想出社，曾问社干部“退社有罪没罪？”（3）本来入社一点也不吃亏，但因不摸底而“怕”吃亏。如晋县北彭庄社彭小盆，是老中农，家有八口人，十七亩地，三个劳动力，骡子一头，大车农具都不全；他看不上社里忙时也早下不了地，在吸收新社员的时候，深入解释和具体算账工作做得又差，他起先有些“怕”，不想入社。后来又想：“人家都入了，咱也进去试试看。”所以入了社。入社后，生产不积极，干活挑轻闲，评分只嫌低。（4）邻居或地邻都入了社，或者水车、牲口及副业生产等跟别人合伙，人家入了社，自己就也跟着加入了。如晋县北彭庄社许振邦，是老中农，家里只他一口人（五十来岁），有十二亩地，其中八亩水地共三块，周围都是社员的地，如果不入社，耕种、送粪都不方便，并且单干做活也嫌难看，更“怕”将来给调换坏地，所以入了社。他自己留了四亩地，入社后一年没到社里去劳动；秋后还没结账就去社里支钱，没支给就不满意。（5）孤寡老弱缺劳力户和少数做小买卖和有手艺的木匠、泥匠等。这些人过去种地，多靠亲戚邻居“串忙”或“雇工”，如今人家都入了社，自己也不能不随着报名。
    第三种，是“请”进来或“混”进来的，共八十七户，占二十六个社的社员总数的百分之七。“请”进来的多是牲口、农具、土地都强或者能写会算的。如涉县杨家山村社员杨满昌，是老中农，有两个强劳力，十二亩好地，一头大骡子，经营技术一般人比不了；经过干部再三动员，他才入了社；入社后也不积极。“混”进来的是地主、富农和会道门头子等。如晋县北彭庄社许小余等十户，本是一大户，当时有两顷多地，四、五个牲口，自己有劳力三、四个，雇用长工三、四个，忙时一用短工就是三、四十个，土地改革时分了他们一顷多地。这家有一人现在台湾，一人当过伪县长，一人在国民党军队里当过兵。现在他们已分成了十户，其中两人在一九五○年曾因打伤过一个干部的眼睛，分别被扣押一年、二年。在建社时，他们找着来入了社；入社以后也不积极劳动，谁积极他们就打击谁。去年秋天，他们兄弟数人又因评分问题，打伤了生产队长。
    从这二十六个社来看，思想教育工作做得好和阶级政策贯彻得好的，自愿入社的比重就大些，勉强进来的就少些，“混”进来或“请”进来的就没有。如涉县茨村两个社，建社时思想发动工作做得比较好；两社共六十二户，完全自愿的三十六户，占百分之五十八；基本自愿的十七户，占百分之二十七；勉强入社的九户，占百分之十四强。思想发动工作做得差的社，如涉县南庄的一个社，共三十五户，完全自愿的占百分之三十一；基本自愿的占百分之四十四；勉强入社的占百分之二十五。
