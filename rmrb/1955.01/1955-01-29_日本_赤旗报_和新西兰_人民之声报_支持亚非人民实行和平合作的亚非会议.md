    Japan's "Akahata" and New Zealand's "People's Voice"
    Support the Asian-African Conference for Peaceful Cooperation Among Asian and African Peoples

    [Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] Japan Communist Party's organ "Akahata" recently published an editorial expressing support for the convening of the Asian-African Conference.

    The editorial pointed out that the holding of the Asian-African Conference is of great historical significance. The editorial said that for a long time, most of Asia and Africa has been regarded as colonies by foreign aggressors, and the voices of the Asian and African people have been ignored and stifled by the imperialists. However, Asia and Africa are now different from the past. Imperialists can no longer arbitrarily control the fate of this vast region, which accounts for more than half of the world's population.

    The editorial then said that obviously, the US imperialists do not like the holding of the Asian-African Conference, because they do not want the Asian and African people to carry out peaceful cooperation. The editorial pointed out: In this regard, attention must be paid to the Manila Treaty Organization meeting to be held in Bangkok, Thailand on February 23, which intends to focus on studying the suppression of national liberation movements in Southeast Asian countries. The editorial said that this is an open provocation to the Asian and African people who demand peace and independence, and is directly opposed to the Asian-African Conference. From this attitude of the US imperialists, it can be seen that the US policy of flaunting "anti-communism" is actually a war policy aimed at enslaving the people of other countries.

    The editorial finally called for strengthening the peaceful cooperative relations between Japan and the Soviet Union, China, and Asian and world countries.

    [Xinhua News Agency, Wellington, 28th] New Zealand's "People's Voice" published an article on the 19th entitled "The Great Force of Asia and Africa Striving for World Peace Has Risen" which said: "All peace-loving people in the world welcome the convening of the Asian-African Conference." The article said: "This decision effectively means rejecting the Western war blocs, and it also means the emergence of a powerful new force striving for world peace."

    The article pointed out that the fact that the People's Republic of China was invited to participate in the Asian-African Conference clearly shows the world that here is a conference that is no longer manipulated by the United States and is truly seeking cooperation and peace. The article said: "If Asian and African countries work along the road towards the goals of the Asian-African Conference, it will be of great help in easing international tensions."

### 日本“赤旗报”和新西兰“人民之声报”  支持亚非人民实行和平合作的亚非会议

    日本“赤旗报”和新西兰“人民之声报”
    支持亚非人民实行和平合作的亚非会议
    【新华社二十八日讯】东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”最近发表社论，表示支持亚非会议的召开。
    社论指出，举行亚非会议这件事，是有伟大的历史意义的。社论说，很长时期以来，亚洲和非洲的大部分地区一直被外国的侵略者们当做殖民地，亚非人民的呼声一直遭到帝国主义者的漠视和窒息。但是，亚洲和非洲现在已经和过去不同了。帝国主义者已经不能恣意支配占有世界人口半数以上的这个广大区域的命运了。
    社论接着说，显然，美帝国主义者是不喜欢举行亚非会议的。因为他们并不希望亚非人民实行和平合作。社论指出：在这方面，必须注意将在二月二十三日在泰国曼谷举行的马尼拉条约组织会议，这个会议打算把重点放在研究镇压东南亚各国的民族解放运动上。社论说，这是对要求和平与独立的亚非人民的公开挑衅，是和亚非会议直接对立的。从美帝国主义者的这种态度中可以看出，标榜“反共”的美国的政策实在就是旨在奴役他国人民的战争政策。
    社论最后要求加强日本和苏联、中国以及亚洲与世界各国的和平合作关系。
    【新华社二十八日讯】惠灵顿消息：新西兰“人民之声报”十九日发表一篇题为“亚洲和非洲的争取世界和平的巨大力量站起来了”的文章说：“全世界爱好和平的人们都欢迎召开亚非会议。”文章说：“这个决定实际上意味着拒绝西方战争集团，也意味着一个争取世界和平的强大的新力量的出现。”
    文章指出，中华人民共和国受邀请参加亚非会议这一事实清楚地向全世界表明，这里有一个不再受美国操纵的会议，它真正在寻求合作和和平。文章说：“如果亚洲和非洲国家沿着走向亚非会议的目标的道路努力，对于缓和国际紧张局势将有巨大的帮助。”
