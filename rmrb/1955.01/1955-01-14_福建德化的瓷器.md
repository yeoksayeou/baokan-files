    Fujian Dehua porcelain, produced in Dehua County, Fujian Province, is known for its hard and pure white texture. Commonly referred to as "China White" and "Goose Down White," it is celebrated as world-renowned porcelain, comparable to Jingdezhen porcelain.

    Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, Dehua County had over 120 porcelain kilns and more than 25,000 workers. The porcelain produced was sold throughout the country and to Southeast Asian countries. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, due to the oppression of the reactionary rulers, porcelain industry taxes continually increased, coupled with inflation and the blockage of porcelain exports, the porcelain kilns closed down one after another. Most porcelain workers wandered to other places, changing professions, and porcelain painters could only make a living by making Buddhist statues. Therefore, on the eve of liberation, less than 300 people in the county were engaged in kiln production. The reputation of Dehua porcelain in the market also plummeted, and even the daily-use porcelain of nearby Yongchun County had to be transported from other places.

    After liberation, the Communist Party and the People's Government have always cared about the restoration and development of Dehua porcelain production, successively issuing large amounts of loans, organizing the supply of raw materials, and promoting the sale of finished products, helping kiln workers solve difficulties, so that many porcelain kilns overgrown with weeds once again rose with smoke. Now, the county has 223 porcelain kilns, and many kiln workers have organized themselves and embarked on the road of collectivization, making Dehua's porcelain production improve with each passing day. Taking the local state-owned Dehua Porcelain Factory as an example, in the past, it had only one porcelain kiln, three dilapidated workshops, seven or eight employees, and could only produce four kinds of products: small cups, individual cups, teapots, and tea trays, with a monthly output of only ten or so dan [approximately 500 kg]. However, in just a few years after liberation, this factory, which was about to close, not only added hydro-powered equipment, but also adopted advanced operating methods such as machine-made porcelain and spray painting. Now, it has four porcelain kilns, seven workshops, and more than 150 employees, with more than 10,000 plaster molds alone. It is now able to supply the people's needs with more than 70 kinds of products and 700 kinds of exquisitely crafted porcelain, becoming the largest porcelain factory in Fujian Province!

    In addition to producing daily-use porcelain, local famous artists such as Su Qinming, Chen Qitai, and Xu Wenjun have also sculpted exquisite handicrafts with national style, such as "Hua Mulan" and "Cowherd and Weaver Girl." These handicrafts are deeply loved by the people and have been selected for exhibitions of Chinese art in the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries. In the past two years, excellent porcelain technology innovators such as Wu Weijin have successfully trial-produced precise crucibles, evaporating dishes and other chemical instruments, as well as industrial porcelain and building materials such as insulators, canning dishes, tiles, and refractory materials. This has opened up a broader prospect for the Dehua porcelain industry. This year, the Fujian Provincial People's Government plans to continue to expand and build some new porcelain factories in Dehua. After the completion and commissioning of these capital construction projects, Dehua's porcelain industry will show an even more prosperous scene. (Attached photo)

    福建德化的瓷器
    武开生
    福建省德化县出产的瓷器，质地坚硬而洁白，俗称“中国白”和“鹅绒白”，被誉为世界名瓷，可和景德镇瓷器媲美。
    抗日战争以前，德化全县有一百二十多座瓷窑，两万五千多工人，生产的瓷器曾畅销全国各地及东南亚各国。抗日战争爆发以后，由于反动统治者的摧残，瓷业捐税不断增加，再加上通货膨胀和瓷业外销的阻塞，瓷窑纷纷倒闭，瓷业工人大多流浪他乡改行转业，绘瓷艺人只能靠做佛像糊口。因此，在解放前夕，全县从事窑业生产的已不到三百人，德化瓷器在市场上的声誉也一落千丈，连附近永春县的日用瓷也得由外地运来。
    解放后，共产党和人民政府一直关怀着德化瓷业生产的恢复和发展，先后发放了大批贷款，并组织供应原料、推销成品，帮助窑民解决困难，使许多长满了蒿草的瓷窑又重新冒起了烟火。现在全县已有瓷窑二百二十三座，很多窑民都组织起来走上了合作化的道路，使德化的瓷业生产日新月异。以地方国营德化瓷厂为例，过去仅有一座瓷窑，三间将要倒塌的工场，职工七八个，只能生产小杯、个人杯、茶壶、茶盘四种产品，每月产量不过十来担。但是解放后仅几年，这个将要关闭的厂子不仅增加了水力动力设备，而且采用了机器制瓷、喷花等先进的操作方法。现有四座瓷窑，七个车间，职工一百五十多名，仅石膏模型就有一万多件。现在已能以七十多种产品和七百多种花样的精美瓷器，供应人民需要，成为福建省规模最大的瓷厂！
    除了生产日常生活用瓷外，当地著名的艺人苏勤明、陈其泰、许文君等还塑造了具有民族风格的“花木兰”、“牛郎织女”等精美的工艺品。这些工艺品深受人民喜爱，曾被选送出国参加中国艺术品在苏联及各兄弟国家展览。近两年来，优秀的瓷器技术革新者吴维金等又试制成功了精密的坩埚、蒸发皿等化学仪器和隔电子、罐头皿、磁砖、耐火材料等工业用瓷和建筑材料。这就给德化瓷业开辟了更加广阔的前途。福建省人民政府今年又计划在德化继续扩建和新建一些瓷厂，这些基本建设工程完工投入生产后，德化的瓷业将出现更加繁荣的景象。（附图片）
