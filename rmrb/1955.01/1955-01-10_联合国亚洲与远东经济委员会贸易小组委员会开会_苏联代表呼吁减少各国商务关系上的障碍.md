Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 9th: According to Hong Kong newspapers: The Trade Subcommittee of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East continued its meetings on the afternoon of the 6th and the morning of the 7th to discuss trade-related issues.

	At the afternoon meeting on the 6th, the Soviet representative, Spandaryan, spoke. He said that the Soviet Union firmly advocates developing trade with all countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, regardless of their social systems. Spandaryan pointed out that the Soviet Union now has trade relations with sixty-four countries, of which it has signed bilateral trade agreements with thirty countries, in addition to some multilateral agreements. For example, in 1953, the Soviet Union concluded a five-year trade agreement with India, which also stipulated that the Soviet Union would provide technical assistance to India. He pointed out that in the trade agreements concluded by the Soviet Union with other countries, the Soviet Union has never stipulated any discriminatory restrictions against other countries. He also spoke about the development of trade between the People's Republic of China and India, Indonesia, Ceylon, Burma and other countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit in the past two years.

	Spandaryan then condemned the United States' "embargo" policy for hindering the development of international economic relations. He pointed out that experience has proved that this "embargo" cannot stop China's economic development, but it does harm the interests of countries in Asia and the Far East that are willing to trade with China. The Soviet representative condemned the piratical acts of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in robbing merchant ships of the Soviet Union, Poland, Britain and many other countries on the high seas. This behavior violates the internationally recognized principle of freedom of navigation on the high seas, hinders international economic exchanges, and intensifies international tensions. The Soviet delegation hopes that the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East will pay attention to this situation and try to reduce obstacles to business relations between countries.

	The Indian representative, Kochar, expressed his hope to expand international trade in his speech. He said: "We agree that unnecessary shackles on international business must be removed."

	At the morning meeting on the 7th, the Indonesian representative, Ismail, said in his speech: Indonesia firmly believes that mutual assistance through cooperation among countries in Asia and the Far East will be of inestimable help in raising the living standards of hundreds of millions of people in this region. He believes that it is "very unrealistic" not to allow China, which has hundreds of millions of people, to participate in this meeting.

	The American representative, Bradman, demanded in his speech that other countries lower tariffs so that American goods could be dumped on the markets of these countries. At the same time, he advocated that the United States "has the right" to implement discrimination against the goods of other countries. He stated that the United States would continue to take "trade restriction" measures for the sake of so-called "security," which shows that the United States will continue to adhere to its "embargo" policy.

    联合国亚洲与远东经济委员会贸易小组委员会开会
    苏联代表呼吁减少各国商务关系上的障碍
    【新华社广州九日电】据香港报纸消息：联合国亚洲与远东经济委员会贸易小组委员会六日下午和七日上午继续举行会议，讨论有关贸易的问题。
    在六日下午会议上，苏联代表斯潘杰利安发言。他说，苏联坚决主张同一切国家在平等互利的基础上发展贸易，不问其社会制度如何。斯潘杰利安指出：苏联现在已经同六十四个国家有着贸易关系，其中同三十个国家签订了双边贸易协定，此外还签订了一些多边协定。例如，一九五三年苏联又同印度缔结了为期五年的贸易协定，其中并且规定由苏联供给印度以技术援助。他指出，在苏联同别国缔结的贸易协定中，苏联绝没有对别国规定了任何歧视性的限制。他并且谈到了两年来中华人民共和国同印度、印度尼西亚、锡兰、缅甸等国间在平等互利基础上的贸易的开展。
    斯潘杰利安接着谴责美国的“禁运”政策阻碍了国际经济关系的发展。他指出，经验证明：这种“禁运”并不能阻止中国的经济发展，但却妨害了亚洲和远东地区内愿同中国进行贸易的国家的利益。苏联代表谴责蒋介石集团在公海上劫夺苏联、波兰、英国等许多国家商船的海盗行为，这种行为违背了国际公认的公海航行自由原则，阻碍国际经济交流，并加剧国际紧张局势。苏联代表团希望联合国亚洲与远东经济委员会能够注意这种局面，并且设法减少各国商务关系上的障碍。
    印度代表科查尔在发言中表示希望扩大国际贸易。他说：“我们同意国际商务所受到的不必要的桎梏必须解除。”
    在七日上午会议上，印度尼西亚代表伊斯梅尔在发言时说：印度尼西亚肯定地相信，亚洲和远东地区内各国以合作的方式实行互助，对于提高这个地区数以亿计的人民的生活水准将有无法估计的帮助。他认为不让拥有数亿人口的中国参加这次会议，实在是“非常不现实”的。
    美国代表布拉德曼在发言中要求其他国家降低关税，好让美国商品在这些国家的市场上倾销。他同时鼓吹美国“有权利”对其他国家的商品实行歧视。他表示，美国为了所谓“安全”，要继续采取“贸易限制”措施，这就表明美国要继续坚持它的“禁运”政策。
