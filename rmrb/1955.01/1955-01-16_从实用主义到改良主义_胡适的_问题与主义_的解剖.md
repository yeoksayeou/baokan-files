From Pragmatism to Reformism
—An Analysis of Hu Shih's "Problems and -Isms"
Wang Ruoshui

Hu Shih's purpose in introducing pragmatism was, on the one hand, to oppose Marxism and, on the other, to promote reformism. This has long been determined. Now I intend to explain: how exactly did Hu Shih use pragmatism to oppose Marxism? How did he use pragmatism to promote reformism? What logical relationship exists between philosophical pragmatism and political reformism?

To explain these questions, I would like to analyze Hu Shih's three articles under the general title "Problems and -Isms" ("Study More Problems, Talk Less About '-Isms'," "Further Discussion on Problems and -Isms," and "Fourth Discussion on Problems and -Isms"). Although Hu Shih did not mention the term "experimentalism" in these articles, in reality, every argument is based on pragmatism. By selecting and analyzing the arguments from these three articles, we can encounter a series of issues such as pragmatism's theory of truth, epistemology, methodology, and historical perspective, and discover the conclusion of applying this philosophy to practical political issues, thus more clearly seeing the reactionary essence of this philosophy.

Hu Shih was adept at playing with beautiful phrases. In these three articles, he used many clever techniques to conceal his position. We now need to rearrange his main arguments in logical order, analyze them one by one, and follow Hu Shih to see how he attempted to lead people step by step towards reformism.

"All isms and all theories should be studied, but only as hypothetical views, not as dogmatic creeds; only as materials for reference and verification, not as religious doctrines to be revered; only as tools to enlighten the mind, never as absolute truths that obscure intelligence and halt thought." [1]

At first glance, this sentence by Hu Shih doesn't seem to have any major errors; it seems only to oppose treating theory as dogma. Doesn't Marxism also oppose dogmatism and treating theory as a finally completed absolute truth? So, perhaps we're mistaken? Perhaps we shouldn't single out Hu Shih's statement as a starting point for criticism?

But let's examine it carefully. It's worth noting that Hu Shih here uses "hypothetical views," "materials for reference and verification," and "tools to enlighten the mind" to contrast with "dogmatic creeds," "religious doctrines to be revered," and "absolute truths that obscure intelligence and halt thought." What does this mean? Does it mean that if we don't treat an ism as a "dogmatic creed," we must regard it as a "hypothetical view"? And what does "hypothetical view" mean?

Here, we encounter pragmatism's theory of truth. Let's see what Hu Shih said in his article "Experimentalism." It turns out that one of the "most important fundamental doctrines" of pragmatism is that all truth is merely a "man-made, most convenient hypothesis." According to pragmatists, there is no such thing as objective truth in the universe; "scientific laws are man-made," "what we call truth is merely a tool for people," and absolute truth "has no basis and cannot be verified." Now we can understand. According to this view, if someone believes that Marxism is not a "hypothetical view" but an objective truth, they are treating Marxism as a "dogmatic creed" and a "religious doctrine to be revered." If someone believes in the existence of absolute truth, believing that Marxism is constantly approaching absolute truth, they will "obscure intelligence and halt thought." This is the true intention of the sentence by Hu Shih quoted earlier.

Marxism also has a "most important fundamental doctrine," which is that objective truth and absolute truth exist; the laws of development of the objective world exist independently of human consciousness. People can only recognize and utilize laws, but cannot create them. Pragmatism denies objective truth and absolute truth, believing that truth is dependent on people and that people can "create" truth, which essentially denies the foundation of all science. Clearly, the "scientific attitude" towards truth that pragmatism touts is nothing other than this anti-scientific attitude.

Under the smoke screen of attacking dogmatism, attacking the belief in objective truth, attacking the science of Marxism, and replacing it with pragmatism's subjective idealism—this is Hu Shih's first tactic.

"When a doctrine becomes an ism, it changes from a concrete plan into an abstract noun. The weakness and danger of '-isms' lie here."

The term "abstract noun" itself is somewhat abstract. What exactly does Hu Shih's attacked "abstract noun" mean?

"Abstract" can be understood as "empty." Hu Shih himself explained: "The 'abstract ism' I am attacking refers to those empty, contentless general terms. 'Extremism,' as used in official circles today, is one example." If understood in this sense, then Hu Shih's statement does contain some truth. "Oh no, extremism is here!" This statement was indeed popular among bureaucratic politicians during the May Fourth period. They didn't understand what "extremism" was, but they instinctively felt that "extremism" was a frightening thing for them. And what Hu Shih was most indignant about at the time was that some people in "official circles" were labeling him an "extremist": "In countries around the world, there are some fools who 'use their ears as eyes.' They hear the term 'Bolshevism' or simply remember the term 'extremism.' They don't understand what concrete proposals this abstract term represents, but they become greatly alarmed. They issue notices to arrest 'extremists' and forcibly pin the label of 'extremist' on someone or other." The "countries around the world" mentioned here are China; the "someone or other" mentioned here is Hu Shih. Someone like Hu Shih, who only advocated "literary reform," actually got the label of "extremist," which shows that those "fools who 'use their ears as eyes'" didn't understand the "concrete proposals" that the "abstract term" "extremism" represented, and didn't understand that these "concrete proposals" were completely different from Hu Shih's "concrete proposals." No wonder Hu Shih shouted about "the danger of abstract nouns." Therefore, Hu Shih specifically listed the "concrete proposals" of the Russians in his article, with the intention of educating those "fools," telling them not to misjudge him, Hu Shih.

But did Hu Shih really only attack the "empty, contentless" "abstract isms" in the minds of those "fools"? No. "Abstract noun" has another meaning.

Here, we need to briefly discuss pragmatism's epistemology.

We must know that some of pragmatism's ideas are close to the "nominalist" school of medieval scholastic philosophy. William James, one of the representatives of pragmatism, said that pragmatism "attaches importance to individual matters, the same as nominalism" [2]. Nominalism believes that all concepts, all universal categories, are man-made, merely nouns created for the convenience of language, or even merely "the tongue vibrating the air." And pragmatism also believes that all "general rules, theorems, categories" are "abstract things," even comparable to the "magic of names" of primitive humans [3]. Therefore, James told people to "shift the point of attention from the first things to the last things; from general rules to facts, from categories to effects" [4]. This means telling people not to bother with "general rules" and "categories" at all. We know that categories and principles belong to rational knowledge. Denying categories and principles is also denying rational knowledge. Dewey "regarded experience and thought as one thing" [5], believing that "the active use of experience is reason, is wisdom, and there is nothing else besides reason" [6]. This is reducing reason to experience, which is also denying reason.

The other meaning of Hu Shih's attack on "abstract nouns" lies here. He believed that in an "ism," only "proposals" are concrete, while "general rules," "categories," and "theorems" are all "empty, contentless" "abstract nouns."

This kind of thinking in pragmatism, as James admitted, is a kind of "extreme empiricism"; in other words, it is anti-rationalist thinking.

Marxism values experience, but believes that people's understanding cannot remain at this stage of sensory knowledge, but must go through the abstract action of thinking, process and transform sensory materials, and rise to rational knowledge. As Lenin said, "All scientific (correct, serious, not fabricated) abstraction reflects nature more deeply, more correctly, and more completely" [7]. Abstract thinking (rational knowledge) is a higher stage of knowledge, and abstract thinking cannot be separated from concepts, categories, and theorems. Rational knowledge reached through scientific abstraction is not empty, but has concrete content, reflecting the internal connections and essence of things.

Under the cover of opposing "abstract nouns," opposing reason, opposing scientific theory, and advocating creeping empiricism—this is Hu Shih's second tactic.

"Empty talk about nice-sounding '-isms' is an extremely easy thing to do. It's something that any Tom, Dick, or Harry can do, something that parrots and gramophones can do."

"We should make the ism and the method of implementation one thing, and never separate them into two unrelated things."

These two sentences by Hu Shih themselves are not wrong, right? Empty talk should be opposed, and theory and practice should also be combined. But what does Hu Shih mean by "empty talk"? How is it not empty talk? How do the ism and the method of implementation "become one thing"? The problem lies here.

Hu Shih gave several explanations for "ism." He repeatedly said, "When an ism first arises, it is mostly a concrete proposal to save the situation. Later, when this proposal is spread, the people spreading it want to simplify things, so they use one or two words to represent this concrete proposal, so they call it 'such and such ism.'" "At the beginning of any kind of ism, they are all concrete proposals, never empty and contentless." "Isms are originally concrete solutions to concrete problems." If we carefully look at these sentences, we will find that Hu Shih either describes an ism as a "proposal" or as a "method." Why doesn't he mention "theory" at all? This is not surprising, because in the view of pragmatism, theory is an "abstract" thing, and truth itself is merely a tool and method for dealing with the environment. Hu Shih wants to talk about "concrete" things. After he excludes the "abstract" things, then what remains in the "ism" is only "concrete proposals" and "concrete solutions to concrete problems." From this, we can see that what Hu Shih means by "make the ism and the method of implementation one thing" is fundamentally not the unity of theory and practice that we are talking about, but the cancellation of theory, leaving only the method. In this way, the ism becomes a method without theory. This is what he calls making the ism and the method "one thing."

To advocate proposals but not isms, to advocate methods but not theory, in this way, proposals become proposals without principles, and methods become methods for blind action. It is precisely this attitude of contempt for theory that allows Hu Shih to say the following: "I hope Chinese opinion leaders will put all '-isms' behind their minds as reference materials." It is precisely this attitude that allows Hu Shih to challenge Marxists with the following words: "Ten copies of 'Das Kapital' are not as good as a little research interest" [8]. Tom, Dick, and Harry actually do not "engage in empty talk about nice-sounding '-isms.'" They truly "put all '-isms' behind their minds," and in their view, "ten copies of 'Das Kapital'" are indeed not as interesting as a full meal. The tune that Hu Shih is singing here is unreservedly learned from Dewey and is no more brilliant than a "parrot or gramophone."

Marxism believes that an ism is both a theory and a method; concrete proposals cannot be separated from general principles, and methods of implementation cannot be separated from theoretical understanding. Theory divorced from practice is empty talk, and practice divorced from theory is blind action. People can only successfully transform the world after correctly understanding it; only after having a rational understanding of social phenomena and forming a scientific theory can they correctly propose "concrete proposals" for transforming society and correctly determine strategies and tactics—"methods of implementation." Denying the enormous guiding significance of theory for practical action is advocating blind practice, which ultimately denies the "method of implementation" itself.

Under the cover of opposing "empty talk" and emphasizing the "method of implementation," denying the importance of scientific theory for practice and advocating blind action—this is Hu Shih's third tactic.

Of course, if one only describes an ism as a "proposal" and a "method of implementation," that still cannot completely achieve the goal of opposing the spread of Marxism, because Hu Shih still cannot come up with a reason why even "proposals" and "methods of implementation" should not be promoted. Isn't he himself promoting pragmatism? Therefore, in "Fourth Discussion on Problems and -Isms," Hu Shih specifically elaborated on "the method of importing theories."

Hu Shih said that he very much approved of "importing theories," but he believed that one should pay attention to three things when "importing theories": (1) the historical situation in which the theory arose; (2) the "author's" life facts and the academic influences he received; (3) the effects that each theory has already produced. Hu Shih called this attitude a "historical attitude."

To understand this "historical attitude," one must look at the article "Experimentalism." It turns out that the meaning of the so-called "historical attitude" of pragmatism is: "There is no permanently unchanging truth in the world, no absolute truth," "When the environment changes, the truth also changes at any time"; therefore, the knowledge that human beings need "is the truth of this time, this situation, this me." And "this truth" is "concrete" and "special." What does "concrete" mean? Hu Shih meant that "anything that can be referred to as this and that, anything about individual and special things, is concrete." What does "special" mean? "Special" is "particular," which is a philosophical term that is opposed to "universal." Hu Shih meant that universal truth and absolute truth do not exist; there is truth for each time, truth for each place, and truth for each person. Now we can understand why Hu Shih called on people to study "the historical situation in which the theory arose" and "the author's life facts," and even specially reminded people that Marx was "a Jew who betrayed Judaism." The intention was only to make people believe that if Marxism is truth, it is only the "special" truth of Marx's "special" era, Marx's "special" environment, and Marx's "special" person, and does not apply to China at all.

Dewey elaborated on this point in more detail in his "Social Philosophy and Political Philosophy" lectures. Simply put, his meaning is that he only recognizes "special ordinances" and does not recognize universal truth, only recognizes relative truth and does not recognize absolute truth, and only recognizes "general rules for each generation" and does not recognize laws that are "applicable everywhere." Therefore, Dewey said that pragmatists "only pay attention to individuals and study special situations."

Two points should be pointed out here:

First, the fallacy of pragmatism lies in separating the universal from the particular and separating absolute truth from relative truth, using the particular to deny the universal and using relative truth to deny absolute truth.

Marxism recognizes both the particularity of things and the universal truth that is "applicable everywhere." Marxism believes that the universal and the particular are unified, that universality is contained in particularity. Human understanding should be further expanded from individual and special things to general things, to the universality of contradictions, and then, under the guidance of this universal law, to understand special things. Pragmatism denies universal laws, which makes people's understanding stay on individual and special things, neither further discovering the common essence and universal laws of things, nor studying special things under the guidance of this universal law. This is of course a method of creeping empiricism.

Marxism also believes that relative truth and absolute truth are unified. Relative truth is constantly accumulated and approaches absolute truth, and absolute truth is composed of the sum of countless relative truths. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Marxists acknowledge that, in the absolute and general process of development of the universe, the development of each specific process is relative, and therefore, in the long river of absolute truth, people's understanding of specific processes at each specific stage of development only has relative truthfulness." [9] Therefore, Marxism opposes simply applying the individual principles and individual conclusions of Marxist classical writers without considering specific historical conditions. Truth is developing and changes with conditions, time, and space, but this does not deny the existence of absolute truth; on the contrary, it takes the existence of absolute truth as a prerequisite. The reason why relative truth is relative truth is precisely because it is a part and an aspect of absolute truth.

Second, although Marxism is a product of certain historical conditions, it is by no means the "truth" of one time, one place, and one person, and it is by no means a local trend of thought in Western Europe. Marxism is a summary of the experiences of the world's working-class struggle. Not only that, but it also absorbed the valuable achievements of all human knowledge. When Lenin mentioned Marx, he said: "He re-examined, criticized, and tested everything that human thought had built, and based on the practice of the workers' movement, he made the conclusions that those limited by bourgeois narrowness or bound by bourgeois prejudice could not reach." [10] Marxism not only reflects the interests and demands of the proletariat as a class, but also reflects the objective laws of the entire social development. Therefore, Marxism is universal truth. Marxism is a constantly developing and perfecting science. Although its individual principles and individual conclusions may need to be modified according to the actual situation in different eras and different countries, the essence and method of Marxism are forever new and always beneficial.

Under the guise of a "historical attitude," advocating relativism, denying universal truth, and denying that Marxism applies to China—this is Hu Shih's fourth tactic.

Here, let's talk about the underlying meaning of Hu Shih's call for people to pay attention to "the effects that each theory has already produced." When talking about Marxism's theory of class struggle, Hu Shih said that this theory has an effect, which is that it will "make the two major forces in society that should have been and could have been helping each other (referring to the proletariat and the bourgeoisie—note by Wang) become two opposing enemy camps, making many constructive relief methods impossible, and making history play out many unnecessary tragedies." The basic idea of this passage is to deny class struggle, advocate class peace, in order to forever maintain the rule of the exploiting class. We will touch on this point later when we talk about Hu Shih's view of history. Here, we only point out:

First, different classes of people have different views on the goodness or badness of effects. What the proletariat considers to be a good effect is considered bad by the bourgeoisie; the reverse is also true. Hu Shih believes that the effect of class struggle is bad because the result of class struggle will eventually eliminate the exploiting class. Therefore, this "bad" is clearly viewed from the standpoint of the exploiting class. But Hu Shih conceals the class nature of this view, saying that the goodness or badness of the effect is classless. In reality, he is passing off the standards of good and bad of the exploiting class as the common standards of good and bad of the entire society.

Second, there are immediate effects and long-term effects, temporary effects and final effects. Class struggle will inevitably shed blood, but only class struggle can ultimately eliminate exploitation, eliminate classes, eliminate the suffering of the oppressed, and achieve a happy, classless socialist society. If the proletariat does not rise up to struggle, then they will suffer greater and eternal pain. In the process of the proletariat's struggle for liberation, setbacks and sacrifices are inevitable, but we cannot draw the conclusion from this "effect" that the struggle should not be carried out, because the proletariat recognizes, according to Marxist theory, that they will inevitably win the final victory. The development of the revolution is curved, and we must never abandon the final goal due to temporary failures. The effect that pragmatism talks about is precisely to only care about the present and not the future, only care about the small benefits that come easily, and not care about fundamental principles. This view of effects reflects the class character of American petty bourgeois merchants. And the bourgeoisie's propaganda of pragmatism to the working masses is also to call on the working masses to leave the collective revolutionary struggle, leave the long-term goals, not engage in revolutionary struggle, and covet temporary and immediate interests, becoming selfish and self-interested individualists.

This is the meaning of the "effect" that Hu Shih talks about. Clearly, this "effect" is fundamentally different from the effect that Marxism emphasizes. The standard that Marxism uses to judge the goodness or badness of effects is the greatest interest of the greatest number, not personal self-interest, and long-term and fundamental interests, not small and immediate benefits.

Under the banner of "paying attention to effects," guiding people to covet immediate personal interests, thereby leading people away from Marxism and away from revolution—this is Hu Shih's fifth tactic.

In summary, the basic pragmatic viewpoints in the aforementioned "Problems and -Isms" are: denying objective truth and advocating subjective assumptions; denying absolute truth and advocating relativism; denying rational knowledge and advocating creeping empiricism; denying the guiding role of theory in practice and advocating blind action; disregarding long-term and fundamental interests and only caring about cheap and immediate "effects." Look, starting from these viewpoints, Hu Shih wants to guide people to reformism.

Since there is no objective truth and absolute truth, since we must abandon reason and deny the great significance of theory, then the conclusion is of course to "talk less about isms." So Hu Shih turns around and tells us to "study more problems." Hu Shih has issued a list of problems: "the livelihood problem of rickshaw pullers," "the prostitution problem," "the women's liberation problem," "the family system problem," and so on. He said: "The great danger of '-isms' is that they can make people complacent, thinking that they have found a 'fundamental solution' that cures all diseases, and from then on, they don't need to bother to study the solutions to this and that concrete problem." Please note that Hu Shih is opposing "studying problems" and "studying isms," and opposing "solutions to this and that concrete problem" and "fundamental solutions." How did this viewpoint arise? It is precisely the logical result of the previous basic viewpoints.

Let us start with the "problems" raised by Hu Shih and compare the two different approaches.

The first approach is the Marxist approach. This is to examine these problems under the guidance of the universal truth of Marxism and under the guidance of the proletarian worldview. First, collect rich factual materials, study the various aspects of the facts in detail, and from this starting point, use "abstract thinking," use "categories" and "theorems," go deep into the internal connections and essence of the problems, jump from sensory knowledge to rational knowledge, and create a system of concepts and theories from sensory materials. In the process of research, one must make one's own thoughts truthfully reflect objective reality and must not bring any subjective arbitrariness; one must carry out scientific generalization, from the special to the general, from the special essence of different problems to the universal laws of various problems; one must not list various problems side by side, but use all one's strength to find the main contradictions; one must not deviate from the principles of Marxism, but combine the universal truth of Marxism with the special reality of China. The result of this research will reveal that all these problems are not isolated and that all these problems are inevitable phenomena of the semi-feudal and semi-colonial old China. The result of this research will reveal that all these special problems have a universal common root, and this root is the oppression of imperialism and the rule of feudal forces. The contradiction between imperialism, feudalism, and the Chinese people is the main contradiction in modern Chinese society, and it is the fundamental problem in modern Chinese society; all other contradictions and all other problems are determined by this main contradiction and fundamental problem. Therefore, if the joint rule of imperialism and feudal forces is not overthrown and this fundamental problem is not solved, then whether it is "the livelihood problem of rickshaw pullers," "the prostitution problem," or "the women's liberation problem," it is impossible to fundamentally solve them. Therefore, all these problems come down to a total problem of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism. Therefore, the task of Marxists is, on the one hand, to face all these problems and fight to improve the lives of rickshaw pullers, to fight for women's economic status and rights, etc.; on the other hand, they must not limit these struggles to this scope, but must guide these struggles in local problems to the fundamental problem, guide them to the road of political struggle and class struggle, and merge these many struggles into a total revolutionary torrent. And the fundamental goal of this torrent is the reactionary regime of old China, the joint rule of imperialism and feudal forces.

This is the Marxist solution to various social problems in old China, and this method has proven to be a revolutionary method.

The second approach is the pragmatic approach. It is best to let Hu Shih himself describe it. "First, study all aspects of the facts of the problem, and see where the disease lies. This is the first step in thinking. Then, based on a lifetime of experience and learning, propose various solutions and various prescriptions for treating the disease. This is the second step in thinking. Then, using a lifetime of experience and learning, plus the ability of imagination, speculate on what kind of effects each hypothetical solution should have, and further speculate on whether this effect can really solve the current difficult problem. As a result of speculation, choose a hypothetical [most satisfactory] solution, and think that it is my proposal. This is the third step in thinking." Okay, let's analyze this.

The first step, "study all aspects of the facts of the problem." How to study it? First, because there is no universal truth and scientific theory is "empty talk," we must "put all isms behind our minds" when studying. This means that in research, we must abandon the past achievements of scientific socialism and leave Marxist theory. Second, because category theorems are "abstract nouns," and reason itself is only the "active use of experience" and has no qualitative difference from experience, it is enough to rely on experience when studying, and do not jump from sensory knowledge to rational knowledge, and do not process and transform sensory materials to form a system of concepts and theories. This means not going deep into the essence from the phenomena of things. Third, because universal laws do not exist and every problem has a "special" truth, we must "only pay attention to individuals and study special situations" when studying. This means studying problems in isolation, without finding the internal connections of various problems, and making understanding stay on individual and special things, without carrying out generalizations and further discovering the universal laws and common essence of various problems.

Clearly, using this method to "see where the disease lies" can only see the surface phenomena of various problems and deny the essential connections behind these phenomena, can only see various parallel, isolated, fragmentary "facts" and deny that universal cause and fundamental contradiction. In this way, the "livelihood problem of rickshaw pullers" is the problem of rickshaw pullers themselves, and this problem is not related to the entire social problem. The rickshaw pullers' freezing and starvation are only their "misfortune," not the common fate and inevitable result of the working people of the semi-feudal and semi-colonial old China. If rickshaw pullers rely on their own "experience," without the guidance of scientific theory and "abstract" rational thinking, then they will not understand that their plight is not a "special situation," but a manifestation of the universal contradiction of the entire society. In this way, they will limit their struggle goals to striving for higher fares and lower rents. They will only pay attention to the interests in front of their noses and lose sight of the fundamental goals and long-term directions. Similarly, "the women's liberation problem," "the prostitution problem," etc., have all become isolated local problems.

Then, the second step of "proposing various solutions" becomes easy to understand. First, since there is no fundamental problem, only various isolated parallel problems, and since there is no universal contradiction, only "special situations," then of course there will be no "fundamental solution," only "various" solutions to one problem or another. This is exactly the explanation of what Hu Shih calls "the solutions to this and that problem." Second, since we must "put all isms behind our minds" and abandon theories that synthesize social practical experience, then of course we can only use the individual's "lifetime experience and learning" when proposing solutions. What is Hu Shih's "lifetime experience"? It is twenty years of living and studying in the families of declining bureaucratic gentry, as well as seven years of studying in the United States. What is Hu Shih's "lifetime learning"? It is American pragmatic philosophy, bourgeois political theory, plus dead knowledge of "national heritage." These "experiences" and "learnings," plus the "ability of imagination" (!), are the basis for Hu Shih, this quack doctor, to "propose various prescriptions for treating the disease."

The third step is "choose a hypothetical solution and think that it is my proposal." How to choose? What standard to use to choose? Not according to the standard of conforming to objective reality, and not choosing objective truth, because in the view of pragmatists, objective truth does not exist, and truth is only a man-made, most convenient hypothesis for coping with the environment. Therefore, we must "create" many hypotheses to "cope with the environment" and choose the "most convenient" one from among them. This hypothesis is "the truth of this time, this situation, this me." "This time" means only taking care of the present and not having long-term plans; "this situation" means only "studying individuals" and not studying the whole; "this me" is the individualist Hu Shih. The fundamental solution is the most "inconvenient" hypothesis for Hu Shih, and its effect is violent revolution, which is very "dangerous." Therefore, it is not the truth of "this me" for Hu Shih. Denying the fundamental solution and advocating piecemeal, bit-by-bit, deceptive solutions has the effect of fundamentally maintaining the status quo, which is "convenient" and beneficial for Hu Shih and can "cope with the environment." Therefore, it is "truth."

This is the three steps of Hu Shih's method of thinking. His first step starts from pragmatism, and by the third step, he has already moved to reformism. In this way, philosophical pragmatism becomes political reformism. In Hu Shih's thinking, pragmatism is the philosophical basis of reformism, and reformism is the political goal of pragmatism.

The essence of this kind of thinking of "studying more problems and talking less about isms" has been more clearly exposed in Hu Shih's later articles. What needs to be mentioned in particular is Hu Shih's "declaration" written in 1930, "Which Road Shall We Take?" Here, Hu Shih shamelessly denied the crimes of imperialism and the existence of feudal forces, saying that this was "fabricating out of thin air." He also brought out the moldy and stale arguments in "Problems and -Isms" eleven years ago, saying, "Even those revolutionaries who claim to have their own ideas are just grasping a few abstract nouns and performing tricks." Coincidentally, he unintentionally brought up the old problem of "the livelihood of rickshaw pullers" again. However, this time, he revealed his own "concrete solution to this concrete problem." He said: "For example, to improve the livelihood of rickshaw pullers, it seems that we should start from managing the rickshaw factories and companies and reducing the daily rent of the rickshaws. If the rent is reduced by two or three dimes, the rickshaw pullers will actually receive two or three dimes of profit every day." Look, isn't our previous analysis proved here! Under the premise of denying the fundamental problem and denying that the aggression of imperialism and the oppression of feudal forces are the root causes of the poverty of Chinese laborers, what fundamental solution can there be to the "livelihood of rickshaw pullers" other than reducing rents and providing relief?

In "Which Road Shall We Take?" Hu Shih also talked about his views on evolution and revolution, which involves another source of Hu Shih's reformist thinking—vulgar evolutionism.

Vulgar evolutionism originated in Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It arose as a counter to Marxist materialist dialectics and belongs to the bourgeois worldview. Vulgar evolutionism denies development and qualitative change, denies the struggle of opposites, and believes that the change of things is only the increase or decrease in quantity and the movement of place. Pragmatism's view of the development of the universe is this view of vulgar evolutionism.

For example, Hu Shih believes that there is no qualitative leap from animals to humans. In the "Preface to Science and Worldview," he said: "Humans are just one kind of animal. They only have differences in degree from other kinds of animals, and there are no differences in kind." The same is true for the development of society. History is just a repetition of the same events. According to Hu Shih's research, capitalism existed in ancient China, and Wang Mang two thousand years ago was also a "socialist." Therefore, today's capitalism and socialism are not new at all. It is very obvious that this view of vulgar evolutionism is utter metaphysics and is thoroughly anti-dialectical. Its purpose is to show that the foundation of society is forever unchanging, so there is no need to fundamentally transform society.

In order to put a scientific coat on this reactionary idea, pragmatists distorted Darwinism. In the article "Experimentalism," Hu Shih especially emphasized the so-called "influence of Darwinism on experimentalism." Later, he said in "Introducing My Own Thoughts": "Experimentalism starts from Darwinism, so it only recognizes that continuous improvement, bit by bit, is real and reliable evolution." Hu Shih put forward the "transformation bit by bit" in the article "The Significance of the New Thought Trend," which was published after "Problems and -Isms," which was based on this theory. He attempted to apply the idea of gradual evolution in Darwinian evolution to the field of social history, thereby advocating gradual reform and denying outbreaks in social development, denying revolution. In "Which Road Shall We Take?" Hu Shih said that "revolution and evolution only have a difference in degree, and they are not two absolutely different things." The purpose of this sentence is to obliterate the distinction between revolution and evolution and then replace revolution with evolution.

Nature and society are two different fields, and it is clear that the laws of biological development cannot be used to explain human social history. We only examine here whether the view of evolution that denies qualitative change is a truly scientific theory. Marxist dialectics believes that the transition from quantitative change to qualitative change is a universal law of the movement of things. Evolution is equivalent to quantitative change in the process of development, and revolution is equivalent to fundamental qualitative change—leap. Evolution and revolution are two forms of movement, both in nature and in society. Of course, there are two situations of fundamental qualitative change, one is outbreak and the other is gradual transition. In human history, the fundamental transformation of societies divided into antagonistic classes is achieved through explosive revolutions; in the biological world, the formation of species is achieved through the gradual elimination of old qualitative elements and the gradual accumulation of new qualitative elements. Although these two situations are different, they are both qualitative changes and fundamental changes. Therefore, the vulgar evolutionist idea that only recognizes quantitative change and denies qualitative change has not only been refuted by the historical facts of human society long ago, but has also been overthrown by the evidence of natural science. Hu Shih wanted to use Darwinism as a guise, but Darwinism actually explained the qualitative changes in the process of biological development [11]. Therefore, the vulgar evolutionist idea of pragmatism is not only irrelevant to Darwinism, but is also the reaction of Darwinism. Darwin broke the metaphysical concept of the immutability of species and proved the occurrence and development of species, which is Darwin's great contribution. Darwin's theory promoted the formation of Marxist materialist dialectics. It was in this situation that the bourgeoisie held out vulgar evolutionism to confront materialist dialectics.

Marxism recognizes evolution, but it believes that evolution is the preparation for revolution, and revolution is the completion and further development of evolution. Marxists do not generally oppose reforms, but they believe that under the conditions of the existence of a reactionary regime, the main task is revolution rather than reform. Therefore, we must guide reforms towards fundamental solutions and guide evolution towards revolution. The reform that Hu Shih, a pragmatist, advocates is a reform that denies revolution, a reform of reformism, and a reform that treats reform as everything. Under the rule of a reactionary regime, this kind of reform will inevitably become a means of easing class contradictions, consolidating the existing regime, and resisting revolution. In other words, this reformism is to tell people not to touch the old economic base and not to overthrow the rule of the reactionary class, but to decorate the facade and implement small favors under this condition, in order to deceive the people and disintegrate the revolution.

Using the views and methods of pragmatism to explain social history leads to the pluralistic view of history of pragmatism. Hu Shih attributes the causes of social phenomena to various factors, such as economy, politics, knowledge, thought, speech, education, etc. All these factors are parallel, juxtaposed

    从实用主义到改良主义
    ——胡适的“问题与主义”的解剖
    王若水
    胡适输入实用主义的目的，一方面是反对马克思主义，一方面是提倡改良主义。这是早已判明的了。现在我打算来说明：胡适究竟怎样运用实用主义来反对马克思主义？怎样借实用主义来宣传改良主义？哲学上的实用主义和政治上的改良主义之间，究竟有什么逻辑关系？
    为了说明这几个问题，我想就胡适的以“问题与主义”为总名的三篇文章（“多研究些问题，少谈些‘主义’”“三论问题与主义”“四论问题与主义”）进行分析。胡适在这些文章中虽然没有提到“实验主义”这个名称，但实际上其中每一个论点都是以实用主义为根据的。我们选出这三篇文章的论点来加以分析，就可以接触到实用主义的真理论，认识论，方法论，历史观等一系列的问题，并发现把这种哲学运用到实际政治问题上的结论是什么，从而更清楚地看到这种哲学的反动实质。
    胡适是善于玩弄漂亮的字句的，在这三篇文章里，他用了很多巧妙的手法来隐蔽他的立场。我们现在就要把他的主要论点按逻辑次序重新排列，逐一加以分析，并跟踪着胡适，看他怎样企图把人们一步一步引向改良主义。
    “一切主义，一切学理，都该研究，但是只可认作一些假设的见解，不可认作天经地义的信条；只可认作参考印证的材料，不可奉为金科玉律的宗教；只可用作启发心思的工具，切不可用作蒙蔽聪明，停止思想的绝对真理。”〔一〕
    骤然看去，胡适这一句话好像并没有太大的错误，好像只是在反对把理论当成教条。马克思主义不是也同样反对教条主义，反对把理论当成最后完成了的绝对真理么？那么，也许我们弄错了吧？也许我们不该把胡适的这一句话挑出来作为批判的起点吧？
    但是且让我们仔细研究一下看看。值得注意的是：胡适在这里是用“假设的见解”“参考印证的材料”“启发心思的工具”来和“天经地义的信条”“金科玉律的宗教”“蒙蔽聪明，停止思想的绝对真理”对立的。这是什么意思呢？难道我们若不把主义当成“天经地义的信条”时，就必须把它看作“假设的见解”吗？“假设的见解”之类，又是什么意思呢？
    这里就接触到实用主义的真理论了。请看胡适在“实验主义”这篇文章里怎么说吧。原来实用主义的一个“最重要的根本学理”就是：一切真理都不过是“人造的最方便的假设”。据实用主义者看来，宇宙间根本没有客观真理这样的东西，“科学律例是人造的”，“我们所谓真理，原不过是人的一种工具”，而绝对真理“是没有凭据的，是不能证实的”。现在我们可以明白了。按照这个说法，那么，如果有人认为马克思主义不是“假设的见解”而是客观真理，他就是把马克思主义当成了“天经地义的信条”和“金科玉律的宗教”，如果有人相信绝对真理的存在，相信马克思主义是在不断地接近绝对真理，他就会“蒙蔽聪明，停止思想”。这就是前面所引胡适那句话的真实用意。
    马克思主义也有一个“最重要的根本学理”，就是：客观真理和绝对真理是存在的；客观世界发展的法则是离开人的意识而独立存在的，人只能认识法则和利用法则，但是不能创造法则。实用主义否认客观真理和绝对真理，认为真理是依赖于人而存在的，认为人能够“创造”真理，这实质上就是否认了全部科学的基础。很显然，实用主义所标榜的对待真理的“科学的态度”，不是别的，恰恰是这种反科学的态度。
    在攻击教条主义的烟幕下，攻击对客观真理的信仰，攻击马克思主义的科学，而代之以实用主义的主观唯心论，这就是胡适的第一个手法。
    “主张成了主义，便由具体的计划，变成一个抽象的名词。‘主义’的弱点和危险，就在这里。”
    “抽象名词”这个名词本身，是有些抽象的。究竟胡适所攻击的“抽象名词”是什么意思呢？
      “抽象”可以了解成“空洞”。胡适自己解释说：“我所攻击的‘抽象的主义’，乃是指那些空空荡荡，没有具体的内容的全称名词。如现在官场所用的‘过激主义’，便是一例”。如果是用这个意义，那么胡适这句话倒也有一部分是实情。“不好了，过激主义来了！”这句话在五四时期的官僚政客中，确是流行的。他们不懂得究竟什么是“过激主义”，但他们本能地感到，“过激主义”对他们是一种可怕的东西。而当时胡适最愤愤不平的，是“官场”上有些人把“过激党”这顶帽子戴在他头上了：“现在世界各国，有一班‘把耳朵当眼睛’的妄人，耳朵里听见一个‘布尔札维主义’的名词，或只是记得一个‘过激主义’的名词，全不懂得这一个抽象名词所代表的是什么具体的主张，便大起恐慌，便出告示捉拿‘过激党’，便硬把‘过激党’三个字套在某人某人的头上。”这里所说的“世界各国”，就是中国；这里所说的“某人某人”，就是胡适。像胡适这种只唱唱“文学改良”的人居然也落了一个“过激党”的罪名，足见那些“‘把耳朵当眼睛’的妄人”全不懂得“过激主义”这一个“抽象名词”所代表的“具体的主张”，全不懂得这些“具体的主张”跟胡适的“具体的主张”完全是两回事，难怪胡适要大喊“抽象名词的危险”了。所以胡适还特地在他的文章里把俄国人的“具体的主张”列举了一番，那用意只是教育那些“妄人”，叫他们不要看错他胡适而已。
    但是胡适真的仅仅是攻击那些“妄人”头脑中的“空空荡荡，没有具体内容”的“抽象的主义”么？不然。“抽象名词”还有另外一个意义。
    这里我们就要简单谈到实用主义的认识论了。
    我们要知道，实用主义的一部分思想是接近中世纪经院哲学的“唯名论”这一派的。实用主义的代表之一詹姆士说过，实用主义“注重各个事项，与唯名论相同”〔二〕。唯名论认为，一切概念，一切普遍的范畴都是人造出来的，都不过是为了语言的方便而造出来的名词，甚至不过是“舌头使空气振动”。而实用主义也认为，一切“通则哪，定理哪，范畴哪”，都是“抽象的东西”，甚至可以譬喻为原始人类的“名字的魔术”〔三〕。因此詹姆士叫人们“要把注意之点从最先的物事移到最后的物事；从通则移到事实，从范畴移到效果。”〔四〕这意思就是叫人根本不去管“通则”和“范畴”。我们知道，范畴和原理这些东西是属于理性认识的。否认范畴和原理，也就是否认理性认识。杜威把“经验和思想看作一件事”〔五〕，认为“经验的活用，就是理性，就是智慧，此外更没有什么别的理性。”〔六〕这就是把理性降低为经验，也就是否认了理性。
    胡适攻击“抽象名词”的另外一个意义，就在这里。他认为，“主义”里面，只有“主张”才是具体的，至于“通则”“范畴”“定理”就都是“空空荡荡，没有具体内容”的“抽象名词”。
    实用主义的这一种思想，正如詹姆士所承认，是一种“极端经验主义”的思想；换句话说，也就是反理性主义的思想。
    马克思主义重视经验，但是认为人的认识不能停留在这种感性认识的阶段上，而要经过思维的抽象作用，把感觉材料加以整理改造，上升为理性认识。正如列宁所说，“一切科学的（正确的、郑重的、不是胡诌的）抽象，都更深刻、更正确、更完全地反映着自然。”〔七〕抽象的思维（理性认识）是认识的高级阶段，而抽象的思维离不开概念、范畴、定理。经过科学的抽象作用而达到的理性认识，并不是空洞的，而是有具体的内容的，是反映了事物的内部联系和本质的。
    在反对“抽象名词”的掩盖下，反对理性，反对科学的理论，提倡爬行的经验主义，这就是胡适的第二个手法。
      “空谈好听的‘主义’，是极容易的事，是阿猫阿狗都能做的事，是鹦鹉和留声机器都能做的事。”
  “应该使主义和实行的方法，合为一件事，决不可分为两件不相关的事。”
    胡适这两句话本身没有错吧？空谈是应该反对的，理论和实际也是应该结合的。可是，胡适所说的“空谈”是指什么呢？怎样才不是空谈呢？主义和实行的方法怎样“合为一件事”呢？问题就在这里。
    胡适对于“主义”作了好几次解释。他再三说，“主义初起时，大都是一种救时的具体主张。后来这种主张传播出去，传播的人要图简便，便用一两个字来代表这种具体的主张，所以叫他做‘某某主义’。”“凡是一种主义的起初，都是一些具体的主张，决不是空空荡荡，没有具体内容的。”“主义本来都是具体问题的具体解决法。”我们仔细看看这几句话，就会发现，胡适不把主义说成是“主张”，就说成是“方法”。他为什么一个字也不谈“理论”呢？这是不奇怪的，因为在实用主义看来，理论是“抽象”的东西，真理本身只是对付环境的工具和方法。胡适是要讲“具体”的，他把“抽象”的东西排除掉以后，于是“主义”里面剩下来的东西就只有“具体的主张”“具体问题的具体解决法”了。由此可见，胡适所说的“使主义和实行的方法，合为一件事”，根本不是我们所说的理论和实践的统一，而是取消理论，单留下方法，这样一来，主义就成了没有理论的方法。这就叫把主义和方法“合为一件事”。
    要主张而不要主义，要方法而不要理论，这样，主张就成了没有原理的主张，方法就成了盲目行动的方法。正是这种蔑视理论的态度，才使得胡适说出下面的话来：“希望中国的舆论家，把一切‘主义’摆在脑背后，做参考资料”，也才使得胡适用下面的话来向马克思主义者挑战：“十部赢余价值论，不如一点研究的兴趣”〔八〕。阿猫阿狗其实是不会“空谈好听的‘主义’”的，它们倒真是“把一切‘主义’摆在脑背后”，而在它们看来，“十部赢余价值论”的确不如一顿饱餐有兴趣的。胡适在这里唱的调子，不折不扣是从杜威那里学来的，而且并不比“鹦鹉和留声机”更高明。
    马克思主义认为，主义是理论也是方法；具体的主张不能脱离一般的原理，实行的方法不能脱离理论的认识。理论脱离了实践就是空谈，实践脱离了理论也是盲动。人们只有在正确地认识了世界之后才能成功地改造世界，只有在对社会现象有了理性的认识，构成了科学的理论之后，才能正确地提出改造社会的“具体的主张”，才能正确地决定战略和策略——“实行的方法”。否认理论对实际行动的巨大指导意义，就是提倡盲目实践，其结果也否认了“实行的方法”本身。
    在反对“空谈”，强调“实行的方法”的掩盖下，否认科学理论对实践的重要性，提倡盲目行动，这就是胡适的第三个手法。
    当然，如果仅仅把主义说成是“主张”和“实行的方法”，那还是不能完全达到反对马克思主义的传播的目的的，因为胡适究竟还拿不出理由来说，连“主张”和“实行的方法”也不该宣传。他自己不是也在宣传实用主义么？因此胡适在“四论问题与主义”里，就专门发挥“输入学理的方法”。
    胡适说，他很赞成“输入学理”，但是他认为“输入学理”时应该注意三件事：（一）发生这种学说的时势情形；（二）“论主”的生平事实和他所受的学术影响；（三）每种学说所已经发生的效果。这种态度，胡适叫它做“历史的态度”。
    要懂得这种“历史的态度”，必须看看“实验主义”这篇文章。原来实用主义所谓的“历史的态度”，它的意义就是：“天下没有永久不变的真理，没有绝对的真理”，“环境变了，真理也随时改变”；因此，人类需要的知识，“乃是这个时间，这个境地，这个我的这个真理”。而“这个真理”是“具体的”“特别的”。什么叫“具体的”呢？胡适的意思是“凡是可以指为这个和那个的，凡是关于个体的及特别的事物，都是具体的”。什么叫“特别的”呢？“特别”就是“特殊”，这是一个哲学上的术语，是和“普遍”相对的。胡适的意思是说，普遍真理和绝对真理是没有的，一时有一时的真理，一地有一地的真理，一人有一人的真理。现在我们可以明白，胡适为什么叫人研究“发生学说的时势情形”“论主的生平事实”，甚至特别提醒人说马克思是“一个叛犹太教的犹太人”了。那用意只是想使人相信，马克思主义如果是真理的话，也不过是马克思那个“特别的”时代，马克思那个“特别的”环境和马克思那个“特别的”人的那个“特别的”真理而已，根本不适用于中国。
    这一点，杜威在他的“社会哲学与政治哲学”演讲录里发挥得更详尽。简单地说，他的意思就是只承认“特别律令”，不承认普遍真理，只承认相对真理，不承认绝对真理，只承认“一代有一代的通例”，不承认“放诸四海而皆准”的法则。因此杜威说，实用主义者“只注重个体，研究特别情形”。
    应该在这里指出两点：
    第一，实用主义的谬误，就在于把普遍的东西和特殊的东西割裂开来，把绝对真理和相对真理割裂开来，用特殊来否认普遍，用相对真理来否认绝对真理。
    马克思主义一方面承认事物的特殊性，一方面又承认“放诸四海而皆准”的普遍真理。马克思主义认为，普遍和特殊是统一的，普遍性即寓于特殊性之中，人的认识应该是由个别的和特殊的事物进一步扩大到一般的事物，扩大到矛盾的普遍性，然后又在这种普遍法则的指导下来认识特殊的事物。实用主义否认普遍法则，就是使人的认识停留在个别的和特殊的事物上，既不要进一步发现事物的共同本质和普遍法则，也不要在这种普遍法则的指导下来研究特殊的事物。这当然是一种爬行经验主义的方法。
    马克思主义又认为，相对真理和绝对真理是统一的。相对真理不断累积起来而接近着绝对真理，绝对真理是由无数相对真理的总和构成的。毛泽东同志说：“马克思主义者承认，在绝对的总的宇宙发展过程中，各个具体过程的发展都是相对的，因而在绝对真理的长河中，人们对于在各个一定发展阶段上的具体过程的认识只具有相对的真理性。”〔九〕因此，马克思主义反对脱离具体历史条件来简单地搬用马克思主义经典作家的个别原理和个别结论。真理是发展的，是随条件、时间和空间而转移的，但是这并不否认绝对真理的存在，相反，是以绝对真理的存在为前提的。相对真理之所以为相对真理，正因为它是绝对真理的一部分、一方面。
    第二，马克思主义虽然是在一定历史条件下的产物，但它决不是一时一地一人的“真理”，决不是西欧的地方性思潮。马克思主义是世界工人阶级斗争经验的总结，不但如此，它还吸收了全部人类知识的有价值的成果，列宁提到马克思的时候说：“凡人类思想所建树出的一切，他都重新探讨过，批判过，并根据工人运动的实践来一一检验过，于是就作出了那些为资产阶级狭隘性限制或被资产阶级偏见束缚住的人所不能得出的结论。”〔十〕马克思主义不仅反映了无产阶级这一个阶级的利益和要求，而且反映了整个社会发展的客观规律，因此马克思主义是普遍真理。马克思主义是不断发展不断完善着的科学，虽然它的个别原理和个别结论是可能在不同的时代和不同的国家中要根据实际情况有所修改，但是马克思主义的实质和方法，却是万古长新，无往不利的。
    在“历史的态度”的幌子下，提倡相对主义，否认普遍真理，否认马克思主义适用于中国，这就是胡适的第四个手法。
    这里再谈一谈胡适叫人们注重“每种学说所已经发生的效果”的背后意义。谈到马克思主义的阶级斗争学说时，胡适说，这种学说有一种效果，就是会“使社会上本来应该互助而且可以互助的两种大势力（按指无产阶级和资产阶级——水），成为两座对垒的敌营，使许多建设的救济方法成为不可能，使历史上演出许多本不须有的惨剧。”这一段话的基本思想是否认阶级斗争，提倡阶级和平，以便永远维持剥削阶级的统治。这一点，我们在后面谈到胡适的历史观时还要涉及到。这里我们只指出：
    第一，效果的好坏，在不同阶级的人是有不同的看法的。无产阶级所认为是好的效果，在资产阶级看来却是坏的；反过来也是一样。胡适认为阶级斗争的效果坏，是因为阶级斗争的结果会最后消灭剥削阶级，因此，这个“坏”，分明是站在剥削阶级的立场来看的。但是胡适却隐瞒这种看法的阶级性，把效果的好坏说成是超阶级的，实际上就是把剥削阶级的好坏标准冒充为全社会共同的好坏标准。
    第二，效果有眼前的效果和长远的效果，一时的效果和最后的效果。阶级斗争不可避免会流血，但是只有阶级斗争才能最后消灭剥削，消灭阶级，消除被压迫者的痛苦，达到幸福的无阶级的社会主义社会。如果无产阶级不起来进行斗争，那么他们就会遭受更大的，永远的痛苦。无产阶级在求解放的斗争过程中，不可避免地会遭受挫折和牺牲，但是并不能从这种“效果”得出不应该进行斗争的结论，因为无产阶级根据马克思主义的理论而认识到，他们必然会得到最后的胜利。革命的发展是曲线式的，决不能由于一时的失败而放弃最终的目标。实用主义所说的效果，正是只顾眼前，不顾将来，只顾便宜得来的小利，不顾根本的原则。这种效果观，正反映了美国市侩商人的阶级性格。而资产阶级向工人群众宣传实用主义，也就是叫工人群众离开集体主义的革命斗争，离开远大的目标，不进行革命斗争，而贪图一时的眼前利益，成为自私自利的个人主义者。
    这就是胡适所说的“效果”的涵义。很显然，这种“效果”和马克思主义所注重的效果是根本不同的。马克思主义评判效果好坏的标准，是最大多数的最大利益，而不是个人的私利，是长远的根本的利益，而不是眼前的小便宜。
    在“注重效果”的招牌下，引导人们贪图眼前的个人的利益，从而使人离开马克思主义，离开革命，这就是胡适的第五个手法。
    综括起来，前面说过的“问题与主义”中的几个实用主义的基本论点就是：否认客观真理，提倡主观假设；否认绝对真理，提倡相对主义；否认理性认识，提倡爬行经验论；否认理论对实践的指导作用，提倡盲目行动；不顾长远的根本利益，只顾眼前的便宜的“效果”。看吧，从这些论点出发，胡适就要把人们引导到改良主义了。
    既然没有客观真理和绝对真理，既然要抛弃理性，否认理论的巨大意义，那么结论当然是“少谈些主义”了。于是胡适转过来叫我们“多研究些问题”。胡适开出了一张问题的清单：“人力车夫的生计问题”“卖淫问题”“女子解放问题”“家庭制度问题”，等等。他说：“‘主义’的大危险，就是能使人心满意足，自以为寻着包医百病的‘根本解决’，从此用不着费心力去研究这个那个具体问题的解决法了。”请注意，胡适是把“研究问题”和“研究主义”对立起来的，把“这个那个具体问题的解决法”和“根本解决”对立起来的。这个观点是怎么产生的呢？它正是前面几个基本观点的逻辑结果。
   让我们就从胡适所提出的那些“问题”出发，比较一下两种不同的对待法吧。
    第一种是马克思主义的对待法。这就是在马克思主义的普遍真理指导下，在无产阶级的宇宙观指导下来考察这些问题。先收集丰富的事实材料，详细研究事实的各个方面，并且由此出发，运用“抽象的思维”，运用“范畴”和“定理”，深入到问题的内部联系和本质，从感性认识跃进到理性认识，把感觉材料造成概念及理论的系统。在进行研究的过程中，一定要使自己的思想如实地反映客观实际，不能带上任何主观随意性；一定要进行科学的概括，从特殊进到一般，从不同问题的特殊本质进到各种问题的普遍规律；一定不要把各个问题平列起来，而要用全力找出主要矛盾；一定不要离开马克思主义的原则，而要把马克思主义的普遍真理和中国的特殊实际结合起来。这样研究的结果，就会发现所有这些问题都不是孤立的，所有这些问题都是半封建半殖民地的旧中国的必然现象。这样研究的结果，就会发现所有这些特殊的问题都有一个普遍的共同的根源，这个根源就是帝国主义的压迫和封建势力的统治。帝国主义、封建主义和中国人民的矛盾，就是近代中国社会的主要矛盾，就是近代中国社会的根本问题；其他一切矛盾，一切问题，都是由这个主要矛盾和根本问题决定的。因此，如果不推翻帝国主义和封建势力的联合统治，不解决这个根本问题，那么，无论“人力车夫生计问题”也好，“卖淫问题”也好，“女子解放问题”也好，都是不可能根本解决的。于是所有这一切问题，都归结为一个反帝反封建的总问题。因此，马克思主义者的任务，就是一方面要面对这一切问题，为改善人力车夫的生活而斗争，为争取妇女的经济地位和生活权利等等而斗争，另外一方面又不把这些斗争局限在这个范围以内，而是要把这一切局部问题上的斗争引导到根本问题上去，引导到政治斗争阶级斗争的道路上去，把这许许多多的斗争，汇合为一个总的革命的洪流。而这个洪流所冲击的根本目标，就是旧中国的反动政权，就是帝国主义和封建势力的联合统治。
    这就是马克思主义对旧中国各种社会问题的解决法，这种方法已经证明是革命的方法。
    第二种是实用主义的对待法。我们最好先让胡适自己来述说一下。“先研究了问题的种种方面的种种事实，看看究竟病在何处，这是思想的第一步工夫。然后根据于一生的经验学问，提出种种解决的方法，提出种种医病的丹方，这是思想的第二步工夫。然后用一生的经验学问，加上想像的能力，推思每一种假定的解决法应该可以有什么样的效果，更推想这种效果是否真能解决眼前这个困难问题。推想的结果，拣定一种假定的〔最满意的〕解决，认为我的主张，这是思想的第三步工夫。”好吧，我们就来分析这个吧。
    第一步，“研究问题的种种方面的事实。”怎样研究呢？第一，因为普遍真理是没有的，科学理论是“空谈”，所以在研究时要“把一切主义摆在脑背后”。这就是说，在研究时要抛弃过去的科学的社会主义的成果，要离开马克思主义的理论。第二，因为范畴定理是“抽象名词”，理性本身不过是“经验的活用”，和经验并没有什么性质上的不同，所以在研究时单凭经验就够了，不要从感性认识跃进到理性认识，不要把感觉材料加以整顿改造，形成概念和理论的系统。这就是说，不要从事物的现象深入到本质。第三，因为普遍规律是不存在的，每一个问题都有一个“特别的”真理，所以在研究时，要“只注重个体，研究特别情形”。这就是说，要孤立地研究问题，而不要找出各种问题的内在联系，要使认识停留在个别的特殊的事物上，而不要去进行概括，去进一步发现各种问题的普遍规律和共同本质。
    很显然，应用这样的方法来“看看究竟病在何处”，那就只能看见各个问题的表面现象，而否认这些现象背后的本质联系，只能看见各个平列的孤立的片断的“事实”，而否认那普遍的原因和根本矛盾。这样一来，“人力车夫生计问题”就是人力车夫本身的问题，这个问题和整个的社会问题是没有联系的。人力车夫的挨冻受饿，这只是他们的“不幸”，并不是半封建半殖民地的旧中国的劳动人民的共同命运和必然结果。人力车夫如果凭借他们本身的“经验”，如果没有科学理论的指导和“抽象”的理性思维，那么他们就不会懂得，他们的痛苦处境并不是“特别情形”，而是整个社会的普遍矛盾的表现。这样，他们就会把他们的斗争目标局限在争取更高的车价，更低的车租上，他们就会只注意到自己鼻子尖前的利益，而失去了根本的目标和远大的方向。同样，“女子解放问题”“卖淫问题”等，也都成了各自孤立的局部问题。
    那么，对于“提出种种解决方法”这第二步也就容易明白了。第一，既然没有根本问题，只有各个孤立的平列的问题，既然没有普遍矛盾，只有“特别情形”，那么当然就不会有什么“根本解决”，只有一个问题一个问题的“种种”解决法了。这正是胡适所说的“这个那个问题的解决法”的解释。第二，既然要“把一切主义摆在脑背后”，既然抛弃综合社会实践经验的理论，那么当然在提出办法时，只好用个人的“一生的经验学问”了。胡适的“一生的经验”是什么呢？是二十年的在没落官僚士绅家庭中的生活和求学，以及七年的美国留学生活。胡适的“一生的学问”是什么呢？是美国的实用主义哲学，资产阶级的政治理论，加上对“国故”的死的知识。这些“经验”和“学问”，再加上“想像的能力”（！）就是胡适这位江湖郎中“提出种种医病的丹方”的根据。
    第三步，“拣定一种假定的解决，认为我的主张”。怎样拣定？用什么标准拣定？不是依照符合客观实际的标准，不是拣定客观真理，因为在实用主义者看来，客观真理是不存在的，真理不过是人造的应付环境的最方便的假设。因此，就要“造”出许多“应付环境”的假设，从其中拣定“最方便”的一种。这个假设，就是“这个时间，这个境地，这个我的这个真理”。“这个时间”就是只要照顾眼前，不要有长远打算；“这个境地”就是只“研究个体”，不要研究整体；“这个我”就是个人主义者的胡适。根本解决对胡适来说，是个最不“方便”的假设，并且它的效果就是暴力革命，这是很“危险”的，因此它不是胡适“这个我”的真理。否认根本解决，提倡枝枝节节点点滴滴的骗人的解决，它的效果是可以从根本上保持现状，这对胡适来说，是“方便”的，有利的，能够“应付环境”的，因此它就是“真理”。
    这就是胡适的思想方法的三步。他的第一步是从实用主义出发的，而到了第三步，他已经走到改良主义了。这样，哲学上的实用主义就变成了政治上的改良主义。在胡适的思想里，实用主义是改良主义的哲学基础，而改良主义是实用主义的政治目的。
    关于“多研究些问题，少谈些主义”这种思想的实质，在胡适以后的文章中，是更加明显地暴露出来了。特别需要一提的，是胡适在一九三○年写的“我们走那条路”这篇“宣言”。胡适在这里竟无耻到公然否认帝国主义的罪恶和封建势力的存在，说这是“向壁虚造”。他又把十一年前“问题与主义”中的发霉的滥调搬出来，说“就是那些号称有主张的革命者，喊来喊去，也只是抓住几个抽象名词在那里变戏法。”可巧的是，他在无意之中又重提起了那个“人力车夫的生计”的老问题，不过这一回，他把他自己对这个“具体问题的具体解决法”泄露出来了。他说：“又如人力车夫的生计改善，似乎应该从管理车厂车行，减低每日的车租入手；车租减两角三角，车夫便每日实收两角三角的利益”。请看，我们在前面的分析不是在这里得到了证明吗！在否认根本问题，否认帝国主义的侵略和封建势力的压迫是中国劳动者的穷困的根源的前提下，对于“人力车夫的生计”问题，除了减低车租和救济之类的办法之外，还能有什么根本解决的办法呢？
    在“我们走那条路”中，胡适还谈到他对进化和革命的观点，这就牵涉到胡适的改良主义思想的又一个根源——庸俗进化论。
    庸俗进化论产生于十九世纪末和二十世纪初的欧洲，它是作为与马克思主义的唯物辩证法相对抗而产生的，是属于资产阶级的宇宙观的。庸俗进化论否认发展和质变，否认对立的斗争，认为事物的变化只是数量的增减和场所的移动。实用主义对于宇宙发展的见解，就是这种庸俗进化论的见解。
    举例来说，胡适认为从动物进化到人，是没有质的飞跃的，他在“科学与人生观序”中说：“人不过是动物的一种，他和别种动物只有程度的差异，并无种类的区别。”至于社会的发展也是这样，历史只是同样事件的反复。据胡适的考证，中国古代早就有资本主义了，而两千年前的王莽也是一个“社会主义者”，所以今天的资本主义和社会主义是毫不新鲜的。十分明显，这种庸俗进化论的见解，是十足的形而上学，是彻头彻尾反辩证法的，它的目的，就是要说明社会的基础是永远不变的，因此不要去根本改造社会。
    为了给这种反动的思想披上一件科学的外衣，实用主义者歪曲了达尔文主义。胡适在“实验主义”一文里特别强调了所谓“达尔文主义对实验主义的影响”，后来他又在“介绍我自己的思想”中说：“实验主义从达尔文主义出发，故只承认一点一滴的不断的改进是真实可靠的进化。”胡适在继“问题与主义”之后所发表的“新思潮的意义”一文中，提出了“一点一滴的改造”，正是以这种理论为基础的。他企图把达尔文进化论中逐渐演变的思想，搬用到社会历史的领域中去，借以提倡逐渐改良，否认社会发展中的爆发，否认革命。胡适在“我们走那条路”中说，“革命和演进只有一个程度上的差异，并不是绝对不相同的两件事”，这句话的目的就在抹煞革命和进化的区别，然后用进化来代替革命。
    自然和社会是两个不同的领域，不能把生物发展的规律拿来解释人类社会历史，这一点是很清楚的。我们只在这里考察一下否认质变的进化观是不是真正科学的理论。马克思主义的辩证法认为，由量变进到质变是事物运动的普遍规律。进化相当于发展过程中的量变，而革命相当于根本的质变——飞跃。进化和革命，这是运动的两种形式，无论在自然界和社会都是一样的。当然，根本的质变有两种情况，一种是爆发，一种是逐渐过渡。在人类历史中，分成敌对阶级的社会的根本变革是通过爆发式的革命来实现的；在生物界，物种的形成是通过旧质要素的逐渐消灭和新质要素的逐渐积累来实现的。这两种情况虽然不同，但都是质变，都是根本的变化。所以，只承认量变而否认质变的庸俗进化论思想，不但早已被人类社会的历史事实所驳倒，并且也被自然科学的证据所推翻。胡适想拿达尔文主义做幌子，其实达尔文主义是解释了生物发展过程中的质变的〔十一〕，所以实用主义的庸俗进化论思想不但和达尔文主义不相干，并且是达尔文主义的反动。达尔文打破了物种不变的形而上学的观念，证明了物种的发生和发展，这是达尔文的伟大贡献。达尔文的学说促进了马克思主义的唯物辩证法的形成。正是在这种情况下，资产阶级才捧出庸俗进化论来和唯物辩证法对抗。
    马克思主义承认进化，但是它认为，进化是革命的准备，革命是进化的完成和进一步发展。马克思主义者不一般地反对改良，但是他认为，在反动政权存在的条件下，主要的任务是革命而不是改良，因此必须把改良引向根本解决，把进化引向革命。而实用主义者的胡适所提倡的改良，是否认革命的改良，是改良主义的改良，是把改良看成一切。这种改良，在反动政权的统治下，必然成为缓和阶级矛盾，巩固现存政权，抵制革命的手段。换句话说，这种改良主义是叫人不要去触动旧的经济基础，不要去推翻反动阶级的统治，而是在这个条件下，装点门面，施行小惠，借以欺骗人民，瓦解革命。
    把实用主义的观点和方法用来解释社会历史，就得出实用主义的多元历史观。胡适把社会现象的原因归结为各种因素，例如经济、政治、知识、思想、言论、教育等等，所有这些因素都是平行的，并列的，同样重要的，其中没有一个是决定的支配的因素。胡适在“科学与人生观序”的附录中说，“历史事实的原因往往是多方面的”，思想知识等也和经济一样，可以“变动社会，解释历史，支配人生观”。正因为这样，胡适才认为一个人的一切作为，一切语言行事，无论大小，无论善恶，都能“留下不能磨灭的结果和影响”〔十二〕。这种历史观的实际意义是什么呢？那就是说，既然没有一种因素是根本的，起决定作用的因素，那么就没有什么“根本解决”；既然各种因素都同等重要，那么改造社会就必须分头努力，一件一件地进行。这就是胡适在“新思潮的意义”里所说的“改造是这个那个制度的改造，这种那种思想的改造，这个那个人的改造”。
    多元历史观使人迷惘于一大串纷乱的因素中，看不见社会发展的根本原因——生产斗争和阶级斗争，其结果，是使人舍本逐末，迷失方向。平均对待各种大大小小的因素，分散力量去注意各种支离破碎的孤立的问题，而美其名曰“具体解决”，这就是胡适的骗术。这种改造，杜威说是“零零碎碎”，胡适说是“一点一滴”，都是不差的。
    这样，胡适的改良主义不仅有生物界的“点滴进化”作“根据”，而且也有多元历史观作基础。
    这种多元历史观也就是庸俗进化论的历史观，它把历史发展看作是各种因素平滑地在数量上的增大和减小，没有根本的质变，没有新和旧的矛盾斗争。胡适在“欧游道中寄书”中主张“比较平和，比较牺牲小些”的方法，而“避免‘阶级斗争’的方法”，正是根据于这种历史观的。取消阶级斗争，调和阶级矛盾，这一点是各种各样改良主义者的共同特色。
    实用主义者既然否认阶级斗争是历史发展的动力，那么他们用什么东西来解释历史发展的原因呢？他们是不是当真把各种因素——经济的，政治的，文化的，思想的等等同样看待呢？不是的，多元历史观只是它的假招牌，唯心的一元史观才是它的真货色。不管实用主义者表面上怎样假装承认物质原因，他们归根结柢是用人性，道德，思想等等来解释历史的。例如杜威甚至说：“为什么世界上终于能以少数人的武力支配世界上大多数人的行为？这就是大多数人不负责任的缘故。……不但如此，大多数人不负责任，也并是世界民主政治发展迟缓的原因。”〔十三〕把统治阶级专制的事实，归咎于人民群众的“不负责任”的精神上的原因。至于胡适，他是更加露骨的主张唯心史观，对于旧中国的一切问题，都用精神的原因去解释。这位从美国学习了实用主义回来，打起“科学的方法”的招牌的医生，对旧中国的诊断书是这样的：“现在国中最大的病根，并不是军阀与恶官僚，乃是懒惰的心理，靠天吃饭的迷信，隔岸观火的态度。”〔十四〕你看，无论是“心理”也好，“迷信”也好，“态度”也好，都是精神的东西，原来旧中国的病和封建势力并没有关系，而是“心理病”。要治心理病，革命当然是不行的，于是胡适“对症下药”开了一个药方，名叫“教育”。
    现在事情已经十分明白了。在实用主义者那里，“改良”也好，“进化”也好，都是叫人在旧中国不要去触动社会的经济基础，不要去碰反动的政权，而是去办学校。杜威跑到中国来大谈教育哲学，说什么“现在社会上根本的毛病，就是因为没有教育，假使有了教育，根本上就可以改革。”〔十五〕而胡适也高唱“教育乃是社会进化和改良的根本方法”〔十六〕，并且捧出那个封建僵尸武训来作为提倡教育的榜样。马克思主义者认为，中国人民群众的贫困和落后现象，是封建势力的长期统治和帝国主义残酷压迫的结果。而实用主义者胡适却倒果为因，硬说帝国主义的侵略（如果有的话）是人民群众自己“不争气”“懒惰”“愚昧”的结果。照胡适说来，中国社会问题的原因，不要到物质生活条件中去找，而要到精神文化中去找；只要有了教育，改变了人心，社会问题就解决了。这里我们就遇到了唯心论的老公式：意识决定存在。
    但是，在反动政权存在的条件下，教育基本上是掌握在谁手里的呢？是为谁服务的呢？不消说是反动统治阶级。于是胡适的“教育”，那目的无非是替帝国主义和中国反动统治阶级训练出更多对他们“有用”的奴才，以便更加巩固他们的腐朽统治。这就是改良主义者胡适的教育论的实质。
    现在我们可以总括起来说几句了。
    胡适在“问题和主义”以及其他文章里所提出的政治主张，是以实用主义为哲学基础的。实用主义这种哲学是彻头彻尾为资产阶级、买办阶级服务的反动哲学。实用主义的哲学理论是唯心的，因为它否认客观世界和客观真理，因为它把真理当成是人造的纯粹假设，因为它用精神原因去解释社会现象和历史。实用主义的方法是形而上学的，庸俗进化论的，因为它孤立地去研究事物的表面现象，因为它只承认量的变化而反对根本的质变，因为它否认事物内部的矛盾和斗争。唯心论是和唯物论对立的，形而上学是和辩证法对立的；所以实用主义哲学是和马克思主义的唯物辩证法完全相反的。实用主义哲学运用在社会历史领域中，就是多元史观，它的实质是唯心史观。从实用主义出发，必然是反对马克思主义，反对革命，必然是提倡一点一滴的改良主义。这种改良主义是彻头彻尾为帝国主义和反动统治阶级服务的。
