An Exhibition Room for Model Deeds of Providing Preferential Treatment was held in Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, in early January. The charts, photos, and objects exhibited in the exhibition room showed the bountiful harvests of land cultivated on behalf of the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers throughout the province. The corn cultivated on behalf of soldier Zhao Xilin by the Liangcun Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qi County yielded a high output of 1,322 catties per mu. The Songcun Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xinjiang County cultivated many vegetables on behalf of soldiers' families, including 8,000 catties of cabbage per mu. Many families of martyrs and soldiers also achieved bumper harvests after declining to be cultivated on their behalf and participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations. The North City District Martyrs' and Soldiers' Production Cooperative in Taiyuan City, with the strong assistance of the People's Government, has grown from eleven families of martyrs and soldiers to nearly four hundred people in the past four years, creating wealth worth more than 26 billion yuan for the country in three years.

Many charts show the care of the People's Government and the people for the cultural and material lives of the families of martyrs and soldiers. Last year, the People's Government spent 7.1 billion yuan to help more than 11,000 children of martyrs and soldiers attend school. Shen Jilan, a model soldier's family member from Xigou Township, Pingshun County, was illiterate in the past. Over the years, she has learned more than 2,000 characters in the people's school. Most of the young soldiers' families in the township have learned to write letters and read newspapers. A set of photos from Lijialing, Wuxiang County, introduces how soldier's family member Zhang Laohan recovered from his old illness after six years of care from local farmers.

Among the exhibits are also many pictures introducing the scenes of disabled revolutionary soldiers and demobilized construction soldiers returning to their hometowns to engage in production. Du Chengguang, a disabled revolutionary soldier, actively led the masses in production and was loved by the people and commended by the People's Government, winning eight medals, nine certificates of merit, and six award flags. He has now been selected as a first-class model disabled revolutionary soldier.

    举办优抚模范事迹展览室
    一月上旬，山西省在太原市举办了全省优抚模范事迹展览室。从展览室展出的挂图、照片和实物中表明了全省各地给革命烈士家属、革命军人家属代耕土地获得丰收的情形。祁县梁村农业生产合作社给军属赵锡霖代耕的玉米，每亩获得一千三百二十二斤的高额丰产。新绛县宋村农业生产合作社给军属代耕很多蔬菜，其中白菜每亩产八千斤。很多烈属、军属在谢绝代耕参加互助合作组织后也获得了丰收。太原市北城区烈属、军属生产社在人民政府大力帮助下，四年来由十一个烈属、军属发展到近四百人，三年中为国家创造了价值二百六十多亿元的财富。
    许多图表表明了人民政府和人民群众对烈属、军属文化物质生活的关怀。去年人民政府曾用七十一亿元帮助烈属、军属子弟一万一千多人上了学。平顺县西沟乡模范军属申纪兰过去不识字，数年来上民校认到两千多字，全乡年轻的军属大部学会写信和能看报纸。在武乡县李家岭的一组照片上，介绍了军属张老汉在当地农民照护下，六年的老病痊愈了。
    展览品中还有许多介绍革命残废军人、复员建设军人回乡生产情景的图片。革命残废军人杜成光积极带动群众生产，受到了人民群众的爱戴和人民政府的表扬，连获八枚奖章、九张奖状和六面奖旗。现在他又被选为一等革命残废军人模范。
