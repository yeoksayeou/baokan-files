Xinhua News Agency, Rome, January 15th: The Fourth National Congress of the Italian Communist Party concluded in Rome on the 13th.

    At the final session on the 13th, delegates continued to discuss Ruggero Grieco's report: "The Agricultural Crisis in Italy and the Struggle to Protect Farmers' Interests and Strive for Land Reform." Many people spoke during the discussion, talking about the massive struggle of Italian working farmers for land and democratic freedom. Girolama Li Causi, secretary of the Sicilian Regional Committee of the Communist Party, explained in detail the agricultural situation in Sicily. He pointed out that the united group of Catholic Democrats, Royalists, and Fascists supported by large landowners is constantly weakening, and emphasized the growing political activism of the peasant masses.

    Leone, a representative of the Communist Party in the Piedmont region and a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, pointed out that Italian rice production is suffering a serious crisis due to the government's implementation of a foreign policy that is shrinking the sales market.

    The conference was concluded by Togliatti. He said: The main task of the Italian Communist Party is to fight against warmongers, against the atomic threat, and against the resolution to arm West Germany.

    The Congress also heard a report from the Credentials Committee and adopted resolutions on various issues.
