    East China Iron and Steel Company's affiliated factories mostly use old equipment from before liberation. In recent years, due to the efforts of the factories' employees, enterprise management has improved, and production has developed. However, on the other hand, there is still enormous untapped potential in each factory. In the past, some factory leaders only saw existing achievements and neglected how to further improve and enhance the management level of existing enterprises to fully leverage the potential. Therefore, the plans they formulated were often backward and unable to guide production. In 1954, although most factories had numerous accidents and extremely chaotic management, they were still able to complete or exceed their plans on a monthly basis. For example, the pig iron production plan of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant and the annual plan of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 lagged behind actual work by more than fifty days. Because the plan could not meet the needs of actual work, on the one hand, the plan was repeatedly added, causing great difficulties for the supply department. Some factories even used substandard steel ingots that had been stockpiled for years to barely maintain production; on the other hand, products outside the plan were not easy to sell, which caused serious backlogs. At the same time, managers were also easily complacent under the guise of the pleasant term "completing the plan every month," failing to see the shortcomings in enterprise management and making it difficult to improve the level of enterprise management.

    These facts should be a lesson worth accepting for enterprise managers. However, when drafting the 1955 plan, although the company's leaders had repeatedly instructed that it was necessary to adhere to the opposition to conservative thinking, the leaders of some factories still did not pay attention to this point. They believed that the equipment was old, the efficiency was low, and found various reasons to prove that production could no longer be increased! If production was to be increased, equipment and employees had to be added. The average advanced time for open-hearth furnace smelting at Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 from the first cycle in April to July after the major overhaul in 1954 was 5.17 minutes per furnace, and from July to September it had reached 5.13 minutes per furnace, but they set the target in the 1955 plan at 5.22 minutes per furnace. The reported daily output of steelmaking pig iron in the 1955 target of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant was 6% lower than the average daily output achieved in their good months in 1954, and the reported daily output of smelting and casting pig iron in 1955 was 16% lower than the average daily output achieved in their good months in 1954. The daily output of converters at Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 had reached 129 furnaces and 131 furnaces at its highest in 1954, and generally reached around 126 furnaces, but when they formulated the 1955 target, they were only willing to propose 120 furnaces, and the highest could not exceed 124 to 125 furnaces. The initial targets for pig iron, open-hearth steel, wire rod, and other products set by individual factories were generally lower than the state's control figures.

    After more than two months of repeated research and a serious struggle against conservative thinking, East China Iron and Steel Company and its eight affiliated factories have prepared a draft of the 1955 production, technology, and financial plan, and have submitted it on schedule. The various indicators in the draft far exceed the level of 1954, with the total output value being 26.60% higher than the originally estimated total value that could be completed, exceeding the state's control figures; main products: 26.30% more steel produced (6.77% higher than the state's control figures), 23.19% more steelÊùê produced (3.77% higher than the state's control figures); production value increased by 13.55% (9.52% higher than the state's control figures); costs reduced by 7.20%, 18.7 billion yuan more than the state's requirement; many of the main technical and economic indicators have reached the higher levels in the domestic steel industry. According to preliminary estimates, the company's production in 1955 will add more than 50 billion yuan in profits to the state.

    How did East China Iron and Steel Company struggle against conservative thinking in formulating the 1955 plan? Experience has proven that it is not enough to rely on written instructions or oral appeals from leaders to eliminate conservative thinking in the process of formulating the plan. Leaders must have a deep and detailed understanding of the actual working conditions of each factory, and meticulously analyze and study the favorable and unfavorable factors in the actual work of each factory, so that the leaders themselves first have a "bottom line" in their minds, and at the same time use the method of carefully calculating accounts and on-site calibration to fight against conservative thinking.

    Before this plan was prepared, East China Iron and Steel Company specially organized a group of cadres to cooperate with each factory to conduct a detailed sorting and analysis of the record of various indicators from January to July 1954, and carefully checked the existing equipment and production capacity of each factory. If there were discrepancies or suspicions, cadres were sent to each factory and workshop for on-site verification, and then based on these basic conditions, the basic data and preliminary indicators for 1955 were first calculated. After the state control figures were issued, each indicator and the basis for each indicator were repeatedly balanced and calculated in the spirit of careful calculation. This played an important role in leading the preparation of the 1955 plan.

    Scientifically analyzing the actual situation in the factory is relatively easy for some far-sighted leaders to accept, but for those with conservative thinking, it must be combined with calibration work. During the preparation of the 1955 plan, the most disputes were at Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1. The state had higher requirements for the steel output of this factory in 1955. Before the control figures were issued to the factory, some managers, led by the deputy director in charge of production, were afraid that the plan would be too tight and that they would suffer losses if they could not complete it. Therefore, they emphasized that the equipment was old and the efficiency was poor, and collected a series of unfavorable factors to prove that production could not be increased. The crux of the problem lay in the daily output target of the factory's steelmaking converters. At that time, the company believed that based on the factory's equipment capacity and normal production conditions, the target of about 130 furnaces per day could be achieved with slight improvements. The group led by the deputy director in charge of production believed that the maximum that could be produced was 120 to 124 furnaces, and no more than 125 furnaces. They believed that if production was to be increased, money had to be given to improve equipment and add people. After the company sent people deep into the workshop and organized workers to calibrate, the result reached 127.5 furnaces. But they still didn't believe it. They then organized another group of people to conduct experiments. When it could be seen that the experiments were nearing the above calibration numbers after the experiment has been half done, they automatically stopped. Later, they believed: "This kind of production violates many operating procedures, and it is difficult to consider it as the basis for the 1955 plan target." The two sides argued, and could not agree. Finally, they organized a third comprehensive calibration including personnel from the planning, production, labor, technical supervision, and safety technology departments. The result was that the efficiency was even higher than the first calibration without violating operating procedures and ensuring safe production, reaching 128.4 furnaces. This proves that the key to the factory's past accidents and poor quality was not because of increased production, but because of the chaos in production management.

    Through the method of carefully calculating accounts, those who had no idea, were blindly conservative, and were unwilling to go deep into reality to conduct research and investigation changed their original views. Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant, the only loss-making unit of East China Iron and Steel Company in 1954, did not analyze and study well in advance when preparing the 1955 plan, nor did it conduct precise calculations. It only compiled a cost target based on the book numbers. In this target, the cost of pig iron greatly exceeded the state's control figures and was even higher than the actual cost in 1954: the cost of steelmaking pig iron was 4% higher, the cost of foundry pig iron was 8% higher, and the total cost exceeded 11 billion yuan. After the company assisted in detailed calculation, the cost of steelmaking pig iron was reduced by 8% compared with the factory's original plan, the cost of foundry pig iron was reduced by 10%, and the total cost was not only not overspent but reduced by more than 7 billion yuan, and reached the state's control figures. The open-hearth furnace smelting time of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 was set at 5.22 minutes per furnace, and after the company sent people to assist in calculating, plus measures to improve the furnace body structure, it was finally determined that each furnace would only take 4.58 minutes without changing the raw materials and increasing the furnace output. Even if the raw materials were changed and the output was increased by 13%, the average would only take 5.15 minutes.

    In the process of preparing the plan, closely relying on the broad masses of employees, listening to workers' opinions, and consulting with employees on matters can not only overcome the conservative thinking of some cadres, but also is a powerful guarantee for overcoming difficulties. When Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 formulated the daily output target of converters, it was tentatively determined to be 128 furnaces after repeated discussions. Most cadres agreed, but individual leaders stubbornly adhered to their own opinions, believing that the target was too high and could not be achieved. Later, the state's requirements for the factory, the factory's existing difficulties and favorable factors were announced to the masses of employees, and the workers were organized to discuss them. The broad masses of workers not only agreed, but also supported this target with practical actions. In the first half of November 1954, they continuously created a record of more than ten days of daily production of 129.5 furnaces and 232 furnaces. Although the daily output was slightly lower in the second half of the month due to the abnormal impact of furnace age, the total average output for the entire month was still close to the planned target. The workshop funding plan of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 2 was brought to the workshop and direct users for joint research. The employees conducted a serious check of this plan, and as a result, the cost of low-value consumables alone was reduced by more than 50% compared with the original plan, and the repair costs were also reduced by 10%.

    Now the factories of East China Iron and Steel Company are working hard with full confidence to complete the tasks for 1955. The party organizations in some factories have led cadres to combine the study of the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee with the examination of complacency and arrogance, and the examination of the attitude towards state tasks, to further mobilize them ideologically. However, there are also some cadres who see that the 1955 plan has been formulated and the employees have also made guarantees, and there have been many new atmospheres in production in the past two months, so they are triumphantly saying: "It is not a big problem to complete the 1955 plan." They did not see that management chaos, many accidents, high costs, and especially low product quality are still common problems in each factory. The average original qualification rate of steel ingots in one factory (the lowest month) can only reach 12.8%. These problems need to be solved urgently, otherwise it will be impossible to smoothly complete the 1955 production plan.
