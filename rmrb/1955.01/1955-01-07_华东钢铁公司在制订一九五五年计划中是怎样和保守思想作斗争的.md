    East China Iron and Steel Company's affiliated factories mostly use old equipment from before liberation. In recent years, due to the efforts of the factories' employees, enterprise management has improved, and production has developed. However, on the other hand, there is still enormous untapped potential in each factory. In the past, some factory leaders only saw existing achievements and neglected how to further improve and enhance the management level of existing enterprises to fully leverage the potential. Therefore, the plans they formulated were often backward and unable to guide production. In 1954, although most factories had numerous accidents and extremely chaotic management, they were still able to complete or exceed their plans on a monthly basis. For example, the pig iron production plan of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant and the annual plan of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 lagged behind actual work by more than fifty days. Because the plan could not meet the needs of actual work, on the one hand, the plan was repeatedly added, causing great difficulties for the supply department. Some factories even used substandard steel ingots that had been stockpiled for years to barely maintain production; on the other hand, products outside the plan were not easy to sell, which caused serious backlogs. At the same time, managers were also easily complacent under the guise of the pleasant term "completing the plan every month," failing to see the shortcomings in enterprise management and making it difficult to improve the level of enterprise management.

    These facts should be a lesson worth accepting for enterprise managers. However, when drafting the 1955 plan, although the company's leaders had repeatedly instructed that it was necessary to adhere to the opposition to conservative thinking, the leaders of some factories still did not pay attention to this point. They believed that the equipment was old, the efficiency was low, and found various reasons to prove that production could no longer be increased! If production was to be increased, equipment and employees had to be added. The average advanced time for open-hearth furnace smelting at Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 from the first cycle in April to July after the major overhaul in 1954 was 5.17 minutes per furnace, and from July to September it had reached 5.13 minutes per furnace, but they set the target in the 1955 plan at 5.22 minutes per furnace. The reported daily output of steelmaking pig iron in the 1955 target of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant was 6% lower than the average daily output achieved in their good months in 1954, and the reported daily output of smelting and casting pig iron in 1955 was 16% lower than the average daily output achieved in their good months in 1954. The daily output of converters at Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 had reached 129 furnaces and 131 furnaces at its highest in 1954, and generally reached around 126 furnaces, but when they formulated the 1955 target, they were only willing to propose 120 furnaces, and the highest could not exceed 124 to 125 furnaces. The initial targets for pig iron, open-hearth steel, wire rod, and other products set by individual factories were generally lower than the state's control figures.

    After more than two months of repeated research and a serious struggle against conservative thinking, East China Iron and Steel Company and its eight affiliated factories have prepared a draft of the 1955 production, technology, and financial plan, and have submitted it on schedule. The various indicators in the draft far exceed the level of 1954, with the total output value being 26.60% higher than the originally estimated total value that could be completed, exceeding the state's control figures; main products: 26.30% more steel produced (6.77% higher than the state's control figures), 23.19% more steel材 produced (3.77% higher than the state's control figures); production value increased by 13.55% (9.52% higher than the state's control figures); costs reduced by 7.20%, 18.7 billion yuan more than the state's requirement; many of the main technical and economic indicators have reached the higher levels in the domestic steel industry. According to preliminary estimates, the company's production in 1955 will add more than 50 billion yuan in profits to the state.

    How did East China Iron and Steel Company struggle against conservative thinking in formulating the 1955 plan? Experience has proven that it is not enough to rely on written instructions or oral appeals from leaders to eliminate conservative thinking in the process of formulating the plan. Leaders must have a deep and detailed understanding of the actual working conditions of each factory, and meticulously analyze and study the favorable and unfavorable factors in the actual work of each factory, so that the leaders themselves first have a "bottom line" in their minds, and at the same time use the method of carefully calculating accounts and on-site calibration to fight against conservative thinking.

    Before this plan was prepared, East China Iron and Steel Company specially organized a group of cadres to cooperate with each factory to conduct a detailed sorting and analysis of the record of various indicators from January to July 1954, and carefully checked the existing equipment and production capacity of each factory. If there were discrepancies or suspicions, cadres were sent to each factory and workshop for on-site verification, and then based on these basic conditions, the basic data and preliminary indicators for 1955 were first calculated. After the state control figures were issued, each indicator and the basis for each indicator were repeatedly balanced and calculated in the spirit of careful calculation. This played an important role in leading the preparation of the 1955 plan.

    Scientifically analyzing the actual situation in the factory is relatively easy for some far-sighted leaders to accept, but for those with conservative thinking, it must be combined with calibration work. During the preparation of the 1955 plan, the most disputes were at Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1. The state had higher requirements for the steel output of this factory in 1955. Before the control figures were issued to the factory, some managers, led by the deputy director in charge of production, were afraid that the plan would be too tight and that they would suffer losses if they could not complete it. Therefore, they emphasized that the equipment was old and the efficiency was poor, and collected a series of unfavorable factors to prove that production could not be increased. The crux of the problem lay in the daily output target of the factory's steelmaking converters. At that time, the company believed that based on the factory's equipment capacity and normal production conditions, the target of about 130 furnaces per day could be achieved with slight improvements. The group led by the deputy director in charge of production believed that the maximum that could be produced was 120 to 124 furnaces, and no more than 125 furnaces. They believed that if production was to be increased, money had to be given to improve equipment and add people. After the company sent people deep into the workshop and organized workers to calibrate, the result reached 127.5 furnaces. But they still didn't believe it. They then organized another group of people to conduct experiments. When it could be seen that the experiments were nearing the above calibration numbers after the experiment has been half done, they automatically stopped. Later, they believed: "This kind of production violates many operating procedures, and it is difficult to consider it as the basis for the 1955 plan target." The two sides argued, and could not agree. Finally, they organized a third comprehensive calibration including personnel from the planning, production, labor, technical supervision, and safety technology departments. The result was that the efficiency was even higher than the first calibration without violating operating procedures and ensuring safe production, reaching 128.4 furnaces. This proves that the key to the factory's past accidents and poor quality was not because of increased production, but because of the chaos in production management.

    Through the method of carefully calculating accounts, those who had no idea, were blindly conservative, and were unwilling to go deep into reality to conduct research and investigation changed their original views. Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant, the only loss-making unit of East China Iron and Steel Company in 1954, did not analyze and study well in advance when preparing the 1955 plan, nor did it conduct precise calculations. It only compiled a cost target based on the book numbers. In this target, the cost of pig iron greatly exceeded the state's control figures and was even higher than the actual cost in 1954: the cost of steelmaking pig iron was 4% higher, the cost of foundry pig iron was 8% higher, and the total cost exceeded 11 billion yuan. After the company assisted in detailed calculation, the cost of steelmaking pig iron was reduced by 8% compared with the factory's original plan, the cost of foundry pig iron was reduced by 10%, and the total cost was not only not overspent but reduced by more than 7 billion yuan, and reached the state's control figures. The open-hearth furnace smelting time of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 was set at 5.22 minutes per furnace, and after the company sent people to assist in calculating, plus measures to improve the furnace body structure, it was finally determined that each furnace would only take 4.58 minutes without changing the raw materials and increasing the furnace output. Even if the raw materials were changed and the output was increased by 13%, the average would only take 5.15 minutes.

    In the process of preparing the plan, closely relying on the broad masses of employees, listening to workers' opinions, and consulting with employees on matters can not only overcome the conservative thinking of some cadres, but also is a powerful guarantee for overcoming difficulties. When Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 formulated the daily output target of converters, it was tentatively determined to be 128 furnaces after repeated discussions. Most cadres agreed, but individual leaders stubbornly adhered to their own opinions, believing that the target was too high and could not be achieved. Later, the state's requirements for the factory, the factory's existing difficulties and favorable factors were announced to the masses of employees, and the workers were organized to discuss them. The broad masses of workers not only agreed, but also supported this target with practical actions. In the first half of November 1954, they continuously created a record of more than ten days of daily production of 129.5 furnaces and 232 furnaces. Although the daily output was slightly lower in the second half of the month due to the abnormal impact of furnace age, the total average output for the entire month was still close to the planned target. The workshop funding plan of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 2 was brought to the workshop and direct users for joint research. The employees conducted a serious check of this plan, and as a result, the cost of low-value consumables alone was reduced by more than 50% compared with the original plan, and the repair costs were also reduced by 10%.

    Now the factories of East China Iron and Steel Company are working hard with full confidence to complete the tasks for 1955. The party organizations in some factories have led cadres to combine the study of the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee with the examination of complacency and arrogance, and the examination of the attitude towards state tasks, to further mobilize them ideologically. However, there are also some cadres who see that the 1955 plan has been formulated and the employees have also made guarantees, and there have been many new atmospheres in production in the past two months, so they are triumphantly saying: "It is not a big problem to complete the 1955 plan." They did not see that management chaos, many accidents, high costs, and especially low product quality are still common problems in each factory. The average original qualification rate of steel ingots in one factory (the lowest month) can only reach 12.8%. These problems need to be solved urgently, otherwise it will be impossible to smoothly complete the 1955 production plan.

    华东钢铁公司在制订一九五五年计划中是怎样和保守思想作斗争的
    凡土、于冰
    华东钢铁公司所属各厂，大部都是解放以前的旧设备。几年来由于各厂职工的努力，改进了企业管理工作，生产发展了。但另一方面各厂还存在巨大的潜在力量。过去，有些厂的部分领导人只看到现有的成绩，忽视如何进一步改善和提高现有企业的管理水平，以充分地发挥潜在力量，所以订的计划往往是落后的，无法指导生产。一九五四年大多数厂虽然事故繁多、管理极其混乱，但仍能按月完成或超额完成计划。像马鞍山铁厂的生铁生产计划和上海钢铁三厂的全年计划竟落后于实际工作五十多天。由于计划满足不了实际工作需要，一方面一再追加计划，以致造成供应部门的极大困难，有的厂甚至把积存数年的次品钢锭也加以利用，才勉强维持生产；另一方面，计划外的产品不易推销，又造成了严重积压；同时，管理人员也容易在“月月完成计划”的好听名词掩盖下滋长自满情绪，看不到企业管理中的缺点，难于提高企业管理水平。
    这些事实，对企业管理人员应该是个值得接受的教训。但在编制一九五五年计划草案时，虽然公司领导也曾一再指示，必须坚持反对保守思想，却仍有一部分厂的领导不重视这点。他们认为设备旧、效力低，找出各种理由证明不能再增加生产了！如果要增加生产必须增加设备、增加职工。上海钢铁三厂的平炉冶炼时间从一九五四年大修后，四至七月份第一周期起平均先进时间是五点十七分钟一炉，七至九月已到五点十三分钟一炉，但他们在一九五五年的指标中订为五点二十二分钟一炉。马鞍山铁厂所报一九五五年指标中的炼钢生铁的日产量比他们一九五四年良好月份已达到的平均日产量低百分之六，上报的一九五五年冶炼铸造生铁的日产量，比他们一九五四年良好月份已达到的平均日产量低百分之十六。上海钢铁一厂的转炉日产量一九五四年最高时已达到一百二十九炉和一百三十一炉，一般已到一百二十六炉左右，但他们制订一九五五年指标时，却只肯提出一百二十炉，最高不能超过一百二十四至一百二十五炉。个别厂初步订出的生铁、平炉钢、线材等指标，普遍都低于国家的控制数字。
    经过两个多月的反复研究，并经过严肃地进行反对保守思想的斗争以后，华东钢铁公司及所属八个厂已编制出一九五五年度生产、技术、财务计划草案，并已如期上交。草案中的各项指标，远远超过一九五四年的水平，生产总值比原来预计可以完成的总值高百分之二六·六○，超过国家控制数字；主要产品：多生产百分之二六·三○的钢（高过国家控制数百分之六·七七），多生产百分之二三·一九的钢材（高过国家控制数百分之三·七七）；生产价值提高百分之一三·五五（比国家控制数字高百分之九·五二）；成本降低百分之七·二○，比国家的要求多降低了一百八十七亿元；主要技术经济指标，很多都已达到国内钢铁业较高的水平。据初步估计，该公司一九五五年的生产将为国家多增加五百亿元以上的利润。
    华东钢铁公司在编制一九五五年计划中是怎样和保守思想进行斗争的呢？经验证明，在编制计划过程中想打掉保守思想，单凭领导上的书面指示或口头号召是不行的，领导者必须深入细致地了解和掌握各厂实际工作情况，精密地分析研究各厂实际工作中的有利和不利因素，使领导者本身首先心中有“底”，同时运用算细账和实地标定的方法同保守思想进行斗争。
    在这次编制计划之前，华东钢铁公司曾专门组织了一批干部，配合各厂把各厂一九五四年一至七月份的各项指标记录进行了细致的整理和分析，并详细地核算了各厂现有设备和生产能力，发现有出入和值得怀疑之处再派干部深入各工厂、车间实地核对，而后根据这些基本情况先算出各基本资料和预拟一九五五年各项初步指标。在国家控制数字下达后，再本着精打细算精神进一步把每一个指标和每一个指标的根据作了反复的平衡和核算。这对领导编制一九五五年计划曾起了重要作用。
    科学地分析厂内实际情况，对一部分有远见的领导人员是比较容易接受的，而对具有保守思想的人来说则必须配合标定工作。这次编制一九五五年计划过程中，争执最多的是上海钢铁一厂。国家一九五五年对这个厂的钢产量要求较高，控制数字还未下达该厂以前，以该厂生产副厂长为首的部分管理人员怕计划紧了吃亏，到时候完不成吃力不讨好，因之强调设备旧效力差，并搜集了一系列不利因素的资料证明不能再增产。问题的症结在对该厂炼钢转炉日产量指标上。当时，公司认为根据该厂设备能力和平时生产情况，稍加改进后就可达到日产一百三十炉左右的指标。以生产副厂长为首的部分人员，则认为最多只能生产一百二十炉到一百二十四炉，再不能超过一百二十五炉，认为要提高产量就得给钱改善设备、添人。经公司派人深入到车间，组织工人标定的结果，达到一百二十七炉半。但他们还不相信，自己又组织了一批人进行试验，在试验进行了一半已可看出完全接近上述标定数字时，便自动停下来。后来又认为：“这样生产违反操作规程很多，很难考虑作为一九五五年计划指标的依据”。双方争论，相持不下。最后他们又组织了第三次包括计划、生产、劳动、技术监督、安全技术等科室人员参加的全面标定，结果在既不违犯操作规程，并能保证安全生产的情况下，反比第一次标定的效力为高，达到了一百二十八点四炉。这证明：该厂过去事故多、质量不高，其关键并不是因为增加了产量，而是因为生产管理上的混乱。
    通过算细账的办法，使那些心中无数，盲目保守，又不肯深入实际进行调查研究的人改变了原来的看法。华东钢铁公司所属各厂一九五四年唯一亏损的单位——马鞍山铁厂，在编制一九五五年计划时，事先未能很好地分析研究，也未进行精密计算，只根据账面数字大体如此地编出一份成本指标，在这个指标中，生铁成本大大超过国家控制数字，且比一九五四年实际成本还高：炼钢生铁的成本高百分之四，铸造生铁的成本高百分之八，总成本超过一百一十多亿元。经过公司协助详细计算的结果，炼钢生铁成本比该厂原订计划降低百分之八，铸造生铁成本降低百分之十，总成本不但没有超支反而降低了七十余亿元，并达到了国家控制数字。上海钢铁三厂的平炉冶炼时间，厂订指标是五点二十二分钟一炉，经公司派人协助核算，再加上改进炉体构造的措施，最后确定在不改变原料和不增加炉产量的情况下，每炉只要四点五十八分钟。即使改变了原料，同时把产量增加百分之十三，平均也只要五点十五分钟。
    在编制计划过程中，紧紧依靠广大职工，倾听工人意见，有事和职工商量，不仅能够战胜部分干部的保守思想，同时也是克服困难的有力保证。上海钢铁一厂制订转炉日产量指标时，经过反复讨论初步确定为一百二十八炉，大多数干部都一致同意，但仍有个别领导人员固执己见，认为指标高了，达不到。后来，把国家对该厂的要求、厂内现有困难情形和有利因素等一并向职工群众宣布，组织工人进行讨论，广大工人不但同意，并用实际行动支持这个指标。一九五四年十一月上半月连续创造了十多天日产一百二十九炉半和二百三十二炉的纪录，后半月虽受炉龄不正常的影响，日产量稍低，但全月总平均产量仍接近计划的指标。上海钢铁二厂车间经费计划，拿到车间和直接使用者共同研究，职工们对这个计划进行认真的核对，结果仅低值易耗品的费用就较原计划减少了百分之五十以上，修理费也减少了百分之十。
    现在华东钢铁公司各厂正满怀信心地为完成一九五五年的任务而努力。有些厂党的组织已领导干部结合党中央四中全会决议的学习，联系检查骄傲自满情绪，检查对待国家任务的态度，进一步从思想上动员起来，但另外也还有某些干部看到一九五五年的计划已经订出来、职工们也提出了保证，近两个月来生产上也接连出现了很多新气象，于是又得意洋洋地说：“完成一九五五年计划问题不大”，没看到管理混乱、事故多、成本高，尤其产品质量低，仍是各厂普遍存在的问题。有一个厂钢锭原始合格率（最低月份）平均只能达到百分之十二·八。这些问题都急待解决，否则便不可能顺利地完成一九五五年的生产计划。
