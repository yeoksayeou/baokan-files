    Eliminate All Spies Infiltrating the Mainland from the Air and Ground
    On the 11th of this month, the Guangdong Provincial People's Court sentenced four groups of special agent bandits who were airdropped into Guangdong Province by the United States and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek in 1952 and captured by us. These special agent bandits were led by Hua Bingyue, Qiu Zhongzhi, Zhu Guanzhou, and Li Jizao, totaling more than sixty people. After being airdropped onto the mainland, apart from two who surrendered and twenty-one who were captured alive, the rest were killed. These bandits had all received espionage and special agent training in American spy agencies and Chiang Kai-shek's special agent agencies in Saipan, Okinawa, Tokyo, Taiwan and other places. They were transported by American aircraft from Okinawa and Taiwan, carrying American weapons, ammunition, maps, radios, and other items, escorted by Americans, and landed by airdrop in our mainland area. The mission of these spies and special agents dispatched to our mainland was to organize so-called "anti-communist guerrilla forces," establish so-called "guerrilla bases," expand special agent organizations, spy on military and political intelligence, conduct armed uprisings, and prepare for the US-Chiang war to invade the mainland.
    On the 21st, the Beijing Municipal People's Court also sentenced two special agents, Wang Xuexian and Zhu Kechang, who were sent into the mainland by Chiang Kai-shek's special agent agencies from Hong Kong via land. These two special agents, under the guise of "returning to the motherland to participate in construction," infiltrated the Beijing Fine Arts Printing Factory and the private Pushan Printing Factory. Their malicious mission was to remain hidden for a long time, spy on the military and political intelligence of the capital, collect national secrets such as factory equipment and production conditions, and supply them to Chiang Kai-shek. Although these special agent bandits, who were resolutely opposed to the people, exhausted their minds, they could not escape the giant palm of the people. They were all captured by us one by one and received the punishment they deserved.
    From the Chiang Kai-shek special agent cases sentenced by the Guangdong and Beijing Municipal People's Courts, we can see that Chiang Kai-shek, with the support and instigation of the American aggressive bloc, is extremely frantic in sending special agents to the mainland, and the methods they use are also diverse. Special agents Wang Xuexian and Zhu Kechang, wearing the guise of workers, under the cover of "returning to the motherland to participate in construction," sneaked into the mainland from Hong Kong, lay dormant in the capital, and carried out various criminal conspiracies. If our state organs had not uncovered them earlier, these two special agents would inevitably have caused us more evil consequences. In the past few years, our state organs and the masses of the people have eliminated many counter-revolutionaries and special agents lurking in cities, rural areas, and industrial and mining enterprises. People are generally very attentive to the security work in these areas and have a considerable degree of vigilance. However, there is not enough attention and vigilance towards the special agent elements who have infiltrated and lurked in the cultural departments and printing organs. Therefore, we must learn a lesson from the uncovering and sentencing of special agent cases lurking in the printing industry in the capital this time, eliminate the special agent elements lurking in the cultural departments and other departments that are not noticed by people, and maintain purity forever. At the same time, the case of the Guangdong Provincial People's Court sentencing twenty-one airdropped special agents should also teach state organs and the masses of the people a lesson: the enemy's dispatch of spies and special agents to the mainland is not necessarily limited to the sea and land routes, but also frantically uses conditions such as dark nights to drop large numbers of special agent elements from the air. Therefore, educating the masses of the people, raising vigilance, and capturing special agents has become a regular task for all regions, all organs, departments, and the broad masses of cadres.
    Now, people can clearly see that the US imperialists' dispatch of various spies and special agents to our mainland to steal military and political intelligence and carry out vicious organizational sabotage activities is an important part of their war preparations and a conspiratorial means for the heinous Chiang Kai-shek traitor to attempt to restore his reactionary rule on the mainland. They collude with each other to carry out this evil and despicable act, and they have done their best in the past and will not relax in the future. Therefore, the people of the whole country must be highly vigilant and constantly strive to eliminate all spies and special agent elements infiltrating from the air and the ground, consolidate the revolutionary order, protect national construction, and support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan.

### 清除一切从空中、从地上潜入大陆的特务

    清除一切从空中、从地上潜入大陆的特务
    本月十一日，广东省人民法院曾判处了在一九五二年由美国及其走狗蒋介石派飞机空投在广东省境内而被我捕获的四批特务匪徒。这些特务匪徒是由华秉钺、邱中直、朱冠周，李积藻等为首的，一共有六十名之多，空降大陆后，除投诚两名，被活捉二十一名外，其余都被击毙。这批匪徒都是曾经在塞班岛、冲绳岛、东京、台湾等地的美国间谍机关和蒋贼特务机关受过间谍和特务训练，分别由冲绳岛和台湾等地乘美国飞机，携带美国武器弹药、地图、电台等物，由美国人护送，侵入我大陆地区空投着陆的。这些间谍特务被派遣到我国大陆的任务，是组织所谓“反共游击队”建立所谓“游击根据地”扩大特务组织，刺探军政情报，进行武装暴动，为美蒋进行进攻大陆的战争作准备的。
    二十一日，北京市人民法院又判处了蒋贼特务机关由香港经陆路派进大陆的特务王学贤、朱克昌两名，这两个特务在“回祖国参加建设”的掩护下混入大陆，钻进北京市美术印刷厂和私营普善印刷厂的恶毒任务，是长期隐蔽，刺探首都的军政情报，搜集工厂设备，生产状况等国家秘密供给蒋贼的。这些坚决与人民为敌的特务匪徒，虽然用尽心机，但均不能逃脱人民的巨掌，被我一一捕获，并受到了应得的惩罚。
    从广东省和北京市人民法院判处的蒋贼特务案件中，我们可以看到：蒋贼在美国侵略集团支持和指使下，向大陆派遣特务，是极度疯狂的，他们派遣的方法也是多种多样的，特务王学贤和朱克昌都是披着工人的外衣，在“回祖国参加建设”的掩护下，从香港混进大陆，潜伏首都，进行种种罪恶的阴谋活动，如果不是我们国家机关破获较早，这两个特务必然会给我们造成更多的恶果。几年以来，我们国家机关和人民群众清除了很多潜伏在城市、农村和工矿企业中的反革命分子和特务分子，人们对这些方面的保卫工作一般说是很注意的，也具有相当的警惕性，但是对于打入和潜伏于文化部门印刷机关的特务分子，还是注意不够警惕不够的。因此，我们必须从首都这次破获和判处潜藏在印刷界的特务案件中吸取教训，把潜伏在文化部门和其它为人所不注意的部门的特务分子清除出去，并永远保持纯洁。同时，广东省人民法院判处二十一名空降特务的案件中，也应该使国家机关和人民群众得到教训，敌人向大陆派遣间谍特务，并不是非经海上和陆路不可，而且是还疯狂地利用暗夜等条件把大批特务分子从空中降下的。所以教育人民群众，提高警惕和捕捉特务就成为所有地区，所有机关部门广大干部群众的经常任务。
    现在，人们可以清楚地看到，美帝国主义者向我国大陆派遣各种间谍特务，窃取军政情报、进行恶毒的组织破坏活动，是它们战争准备的重要部分，也是万恶的蒋介石卖国贼企图恢复它在大陆反动统治的阴谋手段。他们相互勾结进行这个罪恶的卑鄙勾当，在过去是竭尽全力，在将来更不会放松。因此全国人民必须高度警惕，不断地为肃清一切从空中从地面潜入的间谍特务分子，巩固革命秩序，保卫国家建设，支援解放军解放台湾而努力奋斗。
