Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, January 15th: Since the arrival of winter, the militia in various parts of Fujian Province have universally launched military and political training. At present, all of the militia company commanders from across the province and the core members of the primary militias in coastal areas have completed their training in batches. The winter training work for militias and primary militias in various locations also began successively in early January.

This year, the content of the province-wide militia winter training includes political subjects such as the necessity of liberating Taiwan and the mutual aid and cooperation movement, as well as military subjects such as the storage and use of weapons, basic combat knowledge, and basic movement drills. During the training process, exercises such as capturing airborne special agents and combat will be held. Primary militias and general militias in coastal areas will also summarize past experiences in the struggle against the enemy, and study and formulate methods and plans for strengthening the struggle against the enemy in the future.

Since the start of the winter training, the morale of the vast number of militia members across the province has been very high. Every day at dawn, in coastal and mountainous areas, militiamen can be seen braving the cold wind to practice throwing grenades and aiming in the open fields and on the beaches. The trained militia have redoubled their vigilance. In many areas, militiamen check their weapons and ammunition once every day before going to bed so that they can participate in combat at any time. In some areas, militias have also universally strengthened joint defense organizations, and adjusted and increased sentry posts according to the terrain. They said: We must ensure that not a single Chiang bandit special agent climbs ashore, and not a single Chiang bandit special agent escapes to the sea! We will resolutely cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to consolidate coastal defense and fight for the liberation of Taiwan and coastal islands.

    福建省民兵普遍展开军事和政治训练
    【新华社福州十五日电】福建省各地民兵在冬季来临后普遍展开军事和政治训练。目前，全省各乡民兵队长和沿海地区各乡基干民兵的骨干分子，已经全部分批训练完毕。各地民兵和基干民兵的冬季训练工作也在一月上旬先后开始。
    今年全省民兵冬季训练的内容包括一定要解放台湾、互助合作运动等政治课目和兵器保管、使用，战斗常识，基本动作教练等军事课目。在训练过程中，将举行捕捉空降特务和战斗等演习。沿海各乡基干民兵和一般民兵还将总结过去的对敌斗争经验，研究和订出今后加强对敌斗争的方法和计划。
    冬季训练工作开始以来，全省广大民兵的情绪都非常高涨。每天拂晓，沿海和山区，到处都可看到民兵们冒着寒风在旷野上和沙滩上练习投弹和瞄准。受过训练的民兵都加倍提高了警惕性，很多地区的民兵每天在睡觉前还检查一次武器、弹药，以便能够随时参加战斗。有些地区的民兵还普遍加强了联防组织，根据地形调整和增加了岗哨。他们说：我们一定要做到不让一个蒋贼特务爬上岸来，不让一个蒋贼特务逃下海去！坚决配合人民解放军巩固海防，为解放台湾和沿海岛屿而斗争。
