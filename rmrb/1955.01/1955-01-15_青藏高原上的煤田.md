    Coalfield on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
    Wu Zhixiang

    A coalfield has emerged on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of our motherland – the "Wuli" coalfield.

    In May 1954, the Qinghai-Tibet Highway construction troops and laborers began building the road to Tibet from Golmud, on the southern edge of the Qaidam Basin. They followed the Snow River from the Qaidam Desert, entering the valleys of the Kunlun Mountains, and then crossed the snowy mountains to reach the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, at an altitude of over 4,500 meters. In August, the road construction troops and laborers, crossing 120 kilometers southwest of Hoh Xil, discovered the first outcrop of the coalfield in the "Wuli" area, digging out a piece of "black mud."

    "Wuli" is surrounded by mountains and has clear lakes. This area, extending over 600 kilometers from Golmud in the north to the Tongtian River in the south, is uninhabited, with only a very few camel and yak caravans of merchants and pilgrims traveling to Tibet passing nearby.

    The discovery of the "Wuli" coalfield immediately drew the attention of the central and various levels of leadership. Before National Day last year, the Ministry of Fuel Industry dispatched a working group, including geological and mining design technicians. The surveyors overcame numerous difficulties on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. After more than a month of exploration, they finally grasped the characteristics of this coalfield, discovering that it not only has abundant reserves but also is high-quality anthracite.

    Now, the "Wuli East Mine" has officially started production, and the passing vehicles are transporting the coal to stations along the highway and across the Tanggula Mountains to supply Heihe and Lhasa.

    青藏高原上的煤田
    吴之骧
    在祖国的青藏高原上，出现了一个煤田——“乌丽”煤田。
    一九五四年五月，青藏公路筑路部队和民工，自柴达木盆地南部边缘的噶尔穆开始向西藏筑路，他们由柴达木沙漠沿着雪水河，一直进入昆仑山的山谷中，再横过雪山，走上了海拔四千五百公尺以上的青藏高原。八月间，筑路部队和民工们越过霍霍西里西南一百二十公里，在“乌丽”地方发现了煤田的第一个露头，他们挖出了一块“黑泥”。
    “乌丽”重山环抱，有着澄清的湖水。这个地方北起噶尔穆，南至通天河六百余公里间没有人烟，仅有极少数的进藏商旅、拜佛香客的骆驼、牦牛队在它附近经过。
      “乌丽”煤田的发现，立即引起了中央和各级领导的重视。燃料工业部在去年国庆节前，派出了一个包括地质和探矿设计技术人员的工作组。勘探工作者们在青藏高原上，克服了重重困难，经过一个多月的勘查，终于掌握了这个煤田的特征，发现这个煤田不但储藏量丰富，而且又是优良的无烟煤。
    现在，“乌丽东矿”已正式生产了，来往的汽车把煤运到公路沿途各站，并越过唐古拉山，供应黑河、拉萨。
