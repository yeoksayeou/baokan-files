Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 11th: The London "Daily Worker" reported that the Executive Committee of the British Communist Party issued a statement on the 9th, calling on the people to support with their utmost strength the National Day for Visiting Members of Parliament against West German Rearmament, which will be held on January 25th.

The statement said: "The struggle to defeat the rearmament of Germany has reached a new and decisive stage. At this stage, the actions of the British people can stop the implementation of this disastrous policy. The British Parliament must reflect the will of the people and change the government's policy of reviving German militarism. An unprecedented and massive visit to members of Parliament on January 25th, when Parliament reconvenes, will make the MPs understand the wishes of their constituents."

The statement said: The vote in the French National Assembly proves that the French people strongly oppose the revival of German militarism, and only a few members of parliament supported the Paris Agreement. Recent public opinion polls in West Germany also show that 68 percent of men and 72 percent of women oppose the rearmament of West Germany. The entire workers' movement, the Social Democratic Party, the Trade Union Federation with six million members, and the Communist Party are all firmly opposed to the rearmament of West Germany. In Britain, popular opposition to the revival of German militarism is so strong that only 40 percent of parliamentarians voted in Parliament in favor of rearming West Germany. The statement emphasized that the treaty to establish a West German army has not yet been finalized, and a broad-based popular movement can prevent the treaty from being ratified.

The statement pointed out that the current situation is even more urgent because the pressure exerted by the United States to rearm Germany is accompanied by the threat of using atomic and hydrogen weapons. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization's December meeting last year allowed Western militarists to prepare for atomic war.

The statement finally called on the people to step up their struggle and, in the days leading up to the National Day for Visiting Members of Parliament against West German Rearmament, to use every minute to form a powerful demonstration of the people's desire for peace.

    英共号召人民访问议员反对重新武装西德
    【新华社柏林十一日电】伦敦“工人日报”报道：英国共产党执行委员会在九日发表声明，号召人民用最大的力量支持在一月二十五日举行的全国访问议员反对西德重新武装日。
    声明说：“使德国重新武装这件事归于失败的斗争，达到了新的、决定性的阶段。在这个阶段，英国人民的行动能够制止这种灾难性政策的执行。英国议会必须反映人民的意志，改变政府复活德国军国主义的政策。在一月二十五日议会复会的时候，对议员举行空前的最大规模的访问，就会使得议员们明白他们的选民的意愿。”
    声明说：法国国民议会的投票证明法国人民强烈反对复活德国军国主义，只有少数议员赞成巴黎协定。西德最近的民意测验也表明：百分之六十八的男人和百分之七十二的妇女反对重新武装西德。整个工人运动、社会民主党、拥有六百万会员的工会联合会和共产党，都坚决反对重新武装西德。在英国，人民反对复活德国军国主义的情绪是如此强烈，以致议员中只有百分之四十在议会中投票赞成重新武装西德。声明强调，目前批准成立西德军队的条约这件事还没有成为定局，规模广泛的人民运动能够阻止这种条约获得批准。
    声明指出目前局势已经更加紧急，因为美国为了重新武装德国而施行的压力是同使用原子武器和氢武器的威胁一同发出的。北大西洋公约组织的去年十二月会议容许西方的军国主义分子准备原子战争。
    声明最后号召人民加紧斗争，在筹备全国访问议员反对西德重新武装日的未来的一些日子里，利用每一分钟来形成人民和平愿望的强大示威。
