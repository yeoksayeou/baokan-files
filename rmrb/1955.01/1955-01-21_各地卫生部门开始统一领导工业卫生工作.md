Throughout the country, the vast majority of provinces and cities have begun to implement unified leadership over industrial hygiene. Since the First National Industrial Hygiene Conference was held in June of last year, health administrative departments in various provinces and cities have successively convened provincial and municipal industrial hygiene conferences; industrial hygiene divisions and sections have been generally established, or full-time cadres have been assigned, to strengthen industrial hygiene work by taking the lead in industrial hygiene business.

More than twenty provinces and cities, including Shenyang, Harbin, Changchun, Xi'an, Taiyuan, and Hebei, have successively organized industrial hygiene work teams and groups to go deep into factories, mines, and construction sites to assist in consolidating and establishing health and medical institutions in factories, mines, and construction sites; established and improved various health and medical systems, and carried out medical prevention work. The Xi'an Municipal Health Bureau has assisted factories and mines in establishing fifty health and medical institutions. The Shenyang Municipal Health Bureau assisted the Shenyang Chemical Plant and the Shenyang Transformer Factory in establishing workshop health stations. In Shenyang and Tianjin, as experimental areas, the medical relationship between factories and hospitals was adjusted according to the distribution of factories, and a graded medical system was implemented, which not only solved the medical difficulties of workers, but also brought into play the potential strength of medical prevention.

Many provinces and cities have selected some factories and mines to promote the workshop doctor system. Since the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant implemented the workshop doctor system, the number of workers getting sick has decreased. At the same time, it has overcome the phenomenon of long registration, waiting, and medicine collection times, and short consultation times. Medical personnel can face production, attach importance to prevention, and strengthen the relationship between medical personnel and workers, as well as relevant departments such as trade unions. After the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant implemented the workshop doctor system, the iron smelting department workers created a 100% attendance record in September of last year.

Health supervision work has also been initially carried out. The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau has implemented regular health supervision in sixty-six factories. Full-time personnel urge enterprises to improve factors harmful to workers' health in production and life, according to the government's health management regulations. The Xi'an Municipal Health Bureau has conducted preventive health supervision on eleven larger enterprises, with full-time personnel supervising enterprises to carry out construction in accordance with the health standards stipulated by the government.

Local health departments have also adopted off-the-job training, on-the-job education, holding labor hygiene lectures, and sending personnel to large hospitals for internships to improve the professional and political level of industrial hygiene cadres. The training class held by the Ministry of Health from September to November last year provided professional training to industrial hygiene administrative cadres from fifty-three provincial and municipal health administrative departments and industrial departments.

    各地卫生部门开始统一领导工业卫生工作
  　全国绝大部分省、市已开始对工业卫生实行统一领导。自去年六月第一届全国工业卫生会议举行以后，各省、市卫生行政部门先后召开了省、市工业卫生会议；普遍建立了工业卫生处和科，或配备了专职干部，从领导工业卫生业务着手，加强了工业卫生工作。
    沈阳、哈尔滨、长春、西安、太原、河北等二十多个省市曾先后组织了工业卫生工作队和工作组，深入厂矿工地，协助整顿与建立了厂、矿、工地的卫生医疗机构；建立与健全了各种卫生医疗制度，并开展了医疗预防工作。西安市卫生局已协助厂矿建立了五十个卫生医疗机构。沈阳市卫生局协助沈阳化工厂和沈阳变压器厂建立了车间保健站。沈阳、天津两市在作为试验的地区，按工厂的分布，调整了工厂与各医院的医疗关系，实行了分级医疗，不仅解决了工人医疗上的困难，并且发挥了医疗预防的潜在力量。
    许多省、市选择一些厂矿推行了车间医师制。石景山钢铁厂推行车间医师制以来，工人生病的减少了，同时克服了门诊挂号、候诊、取药时间长，看病时间短的现象，医务人员都能面向生产、重视预防工作，密切了医务人员和工人以及工会等有关部门的关系。太原钢铁厂自推行车间医师制后，炼铁部工人在去年九月创造了百分之百出勤的纪录。
    卫生监督工作也已初步开展。上海市卫生局在六十六个工厂中实行了经常性的卫生监督，由专职人员根据政府规定的卫生管理办法，督促企业改进工人生产和生活中有害健康的因素，西安市卫生局对十一个较大的企业进行了预防性的卫生监督，由专职人员监督企业按照政府规定的卫生标准进行建设。
    各地卫生部门并采用离职训练、在职教育、举办劳动卫生讲座、派往大医院实习等方式提高了工业卫生干部的业务水平和政治水平。卫生部在去年九月到十一月间举办的训练班使五十三个省、市卫生行政部门以及工业部门的工业卫生行政干部受到了专业训练。　　　（新华社）
