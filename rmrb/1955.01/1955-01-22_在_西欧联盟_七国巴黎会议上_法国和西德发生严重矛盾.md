Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 21st dispatch: The seven-nation experts conference of the "Western European Union," which began in Paris on the 17th to study the French "arms integration" plan, had to adjourn until the 21st because West German representative Erhard suddenly left for Bonn. Paris newspapers reported that serious differences had already been exposed between France and West Germany at the meeting.

On the 17th, a French memorandum was read out, in which France suggested the establishment of an "organization for the production, standardization, and distribution of armaments, as well as the supervision of armaments." On the 18th, the representatives of various countries expressed their opinions on this proposal.

In response to the French memorandum, Erhard submitted the German counter-proposal to the conference participants on the 18th. Erhard advocated "free competition" and opposed granting the "integration organization" the power to formulate military production plans and allocate orders among member states. The West German representatives made it clear that they rejected any measures aimed at limiting West German armaments.

The French plan was also opposed by other delegations, especially those from Britain, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The London "Times" questioned whether the French plan was realistic.

The West German representatives agreed to hold talks on certain issues in the French plan, such as cooperation between governments. Some commentators, citing "delegation sources," speculated that the conference had apparently been attempting to formulate a "compromise" solution to facilitate the final approval of the Paris Accords by the French ruling clique.

    在“西欧联盟”七国巴黎会议上
    法国和西德发生严重矛盾
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：从十七日开始在巴黎举行的研究法国“军备统筹”计划的“西欧联盟”七国专家会议，因为西德代表艾哈德突然动身到波恩去而不得不休会到二十一日。巴黎各报报道，会上法国和西德之间已经暴露了严重的分歧。
    十七日，会议宣读了一份法国备忘录，法国建议成立一个“关于军备的生产、标准化和分配以及军备监督的机构”。十八日，各国代表对这个建议发表意见。
    作为对法国备忘录的回答，艾哈德在十八日把德国的反建议交给了会议参加者。艾哈德主张“自由竞争”，反对把制订军事生产计划和在成员国之间分配订货单的权力交给这个“统筹机构”。西德代表明白表示，他们拒绝目的在限制西德军备的任何措施。
    法国计划也遭到了其他代表团，特别是英国、比利时和荷兰代表团的反对。伦敦“泰晤士报”怀疑法国计划是不是现实的。
    西德代表们同意就法国计划中的某些问题例如各国政府间的合作问题举行会谈。某些评论家援引“代表团人士”的话推测说，会议显然已经进行尝试来拟定一项“折衷”办法，以便利法国统治集团最后批准巴黎协定。
