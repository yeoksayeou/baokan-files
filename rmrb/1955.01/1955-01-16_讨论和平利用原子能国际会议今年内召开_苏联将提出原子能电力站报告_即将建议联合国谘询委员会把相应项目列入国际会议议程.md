    大家知道，在一九五四年七月一日发表的一项正式公报说，苏联第一个原子能工业电力站已经开始发电，并且为附近地区的工业和农业输送电力。
    苏联政府由于认识到把原子能用于和平目的的极大重要性，并且为了促进这方面的国际合作，准备传播苏联积累起来的有关的科学技术经验。
    为了这个目的，苏联政府准备向讨论和平利用原子能国际会议提出关于苏联第一个原子能工业电力站及其工作情况的报告。根据联合国大会第九届会议的决定，这个会议将在一九五五年内召开。
    现已任命德·维·斯科贝尔琴院士为参加联合国大会设立的负责召集上述会议的联合国谘询委员会的苏联代表。已训令他提出把相应项目列入会议议程的建议。
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社纽约十四日讯：前已报道，联合国大会第九届会议在一九五四年十二月四日一致通过了一项关于在促进原子能用于和平目的方面进行国际合作的决议。决议规定不迟于一九五五年八月召开一次讨论和平利用原子能国际会议。为了筹备这次会议的召开，根据大会的决议成立了一个谘询委员会，由苏联、美国、英国、法国、巴西、印度和加拿大的代表组成。这个委员会将把它关于上述会议的组织和议程问题的结论提交联合国秘书长。
