The areas in the Jingzhou Special District of Hubei Province that have been affected by the floods are actively devising methods to ensure draft cattle survive the winter. In the flood-stricken areas of the entire special district, there are more than 300,000 head of draft cattle. When the cold wave arrived, most of the disaster areas organized institutions to protect draft cattle through the winter and studied methods to help them survive. At present, most disaster areas have convened veterinary representative meetings to exchange experiences in protecting draft cattle through the winter. The entire district has organized 1,550 veterinarians to go to various places to treat diseases in draft cattle. Under the assistance of Party and government leaders, disaster victims in various places are relying on mutual aid and cooperative organizations, taking measures such as building cattle sheds, digging earthen caves, and finding substitute feed to protect draft cattle through the winter. State-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have purchased large quantities of fodder to solve the feed problem for draft cattle. The entire district has distributed more than 10 billion yuan in relief funds and loans for draft cattle. (Report from our Hubei correspondent station)

    水灾地区设法保护耕牛过冬
    湖北省荆州专区受水灾地区正在积极设法安置耕牛过冬。全专区受水灾地区共有耕牛三十多万头，当寒潮到来时，大部灾区即组织保护耕牛过冬的机构，研究耕牛过冬的办法。目前大部分灾区召开了兽医代表会，交流保护耕牛过冬的经验。全区已组织兽医一千五百五十人到各地为耕牛治疗疾病。各地灾民在党政领导协助下，正在依靠互助合作组织，采取搭牛棚、挖土洞、找代食品等办法保护耕牛过冬。各地国营商业部门和供销合作社等已大量收购草料解决耕牛的饲料问题。全区已发放耕牛救济款和贷款一百多亿元。（本报湖北记者站）
