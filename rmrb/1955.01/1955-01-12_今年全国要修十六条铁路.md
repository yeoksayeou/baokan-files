Sixteen Railways to be Built Across the Country This Year

The draft of the national railway basic construction plan for 1955 has been completed, and the scale of construction is even larger than in 1954.

This year, sixteen railways are to be built, with plans to lay more than 1,000 kilometers of track by the end of the year. This includes the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway and Baoji-Chengdu Railway, which have already started construction, as well as the Jining-Erlian Railway and Fengtai-Shacheng section, which will be completed this year; there are also dedicated railways supporting heavy industrial construction; in order to ensure the transportation of timber for industrial construction, the Tangwanghe-Linchuan Railway and Yakeshi-Linchuan Railway will continue to be built; and a new forest railway is planned to be built in the Changbai Mountain forest area. The main bridge project of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge will also begin construction this year.

In order to complete the heavy railway transportation tasks, the technical transformation of operational railways will also be carried out on a large scale this year. It is planned to build double tracks on some sections of the busy Beijing-Hankou Railway, Beijing-Baotou Railway, and Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway. This year, it is planned to expand ten large-scale hub stations.

In order to meet the needs of railway transportation, it is also planned to build and expand locomotive and rolling stock repair factories and sleeper anti-corrosion factories in Chengdu, Lanzhou, Changchun, Liuzhou and other places this year.

    今年全国要修十六条铁路
    全国铁路一九五五年基本建设计划草案已经编制完成，建设规模比一九五四年更大。
    今年内要修筑十六条铁路，计划到年底铺轨一千多公里。其中包括已经开工的兰新路、宝成路和今年完工的集二线、丰沙段；还有配合重工业建设的专用铁路；为了保证工业建设的木材运输，还要继续修筑汤林线和牙林线；并计划在长白山林区里修筑一条新的森林铁路。武汉长江大桥正桥工程也将在今年开工。
    为完成繁重的铁路运输任务，今年营业铁路技术改造规模也很大。计划在运输繁忙的京汉铁路、京包铁路、石太铁路等部分区段修筑复线。今年计划扩建十个规模巨大的枢纽车站。
    为了适应铁路运输需要，今年还计划在成都、兰州、长春、柳州等地新建和扩建机车车辆修理工厂和枕木防腐工厂。
