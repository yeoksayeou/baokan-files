Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 22nd: Czechoslovak Foreign Minister V. David, at a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Assembly, explained the Czechoslovak government's views on the German question with regard to the Soviet government's statement of January 15th.

He said that the Soviet government's statement on the German question is a new and extremely important action in the Soviet Union's consistent foreign policy aimed at maintaining and consolidating peace in Europe and the world. The Czechoslovak government fully endorses and supports this new step by the Soviet government.

David analyzed in detail the great significance of the Soviet statement.

He then said that the government of the Czechoslovak Republic considers the following situation to be absolutely abnormal: ten years after the end of the war, there is still no peace treaty with Germany; due to the faults of Western countries, primarily the United States, and in violation of the will of the German people, Germany has not yet been unified, while some are attempting to turn West Germany into a springboard for aggression against countries of the peace camp.

The Czechoslovak government believes that this intolerable situation must be stopped. It has consistently supported the Soviet policy, which, since the end of the war, has continuously taken measures to ensure peace, guarantee a democratic solution to the German question, establish a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany, and conclude a peace treaty with Germany.

The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Czechoslovak National Assembly discussed the Foreign Minister's statement and unanimously adopted it.

    捷外长拥护苏联政府关于德国问题的声明
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社布拉格二十二日讯：捷克斯洛伐克外交部长瓦·戴维在国民议会外交委员会会议上就苏联政府一月十五日的声明说明了捷克斯洛伐克政府对德国问题的观点。
    他说，苏联政府关于德国问题的声明是苏联始终如一地致力于维持和巩固欧洲和世界和平的外交政策的一个新的、极其重要的行动。捷克斯洛伐克政府完全拥护和支持苏联政府的这一新步骤。
    戴维详细分析了苏联声明的重大意义。
    他接着说，捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府认为，下列情况是绝对不正常的：在战争结束了十年之后，还没有缔结对德和约；由于西方国家、首先主要是美国的过错，违反着德国人民的意志，德国到现在还没有获得统一，同时有人正在企图把西德变成侵略和平阵营国家的跳板。
    捷克斯洛伐克政府认为，必须中止这种不能容忍的局面。它一贯地拥护苏联的政策，苏联从战争结束以来，就不断地采取措施以保障和平，保证以民主方式解决德国问题和建立一个统一、和平和民主的德国以及缔结对德和约。
    捷克斯洛伐克国民议会外交委员会讨论了外交部长的声明，并且一致通过了这个声明。
