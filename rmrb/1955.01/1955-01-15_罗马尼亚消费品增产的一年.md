    罗马尼亚消费品增产的一年
    罗马尼亚的消费品工业在一九五四年生产了丰富的消费品。和战前相比，服装的产量增加为一九三八年的十倍，棉织品和玻璃器皿的产量增加为二倍半，毛织品和皮鞋的产量增加为二倍多，蔬菜罐头和食油的产量分别增加为十一倍和三点五倍。
    和产量增加同时，消费品的种类也增多了。在一九五四年中，罗马尼亚的轻工业企业共生产了一千五百多种新货品，单是布加勒斯特的“乔治乌—德治”被服厂就生产了三百种新式服装。罗马尼亚的食品工业这一年共生产二百五十种肉制品、鱼类罐头、面包、糖果、果汁等食品。电气工业和五金工业生产的消费品种类也增加了。例如，一九五四年生产的五金消费品已经增加到一百五十多类，总共约有一千七百种。电气工业生产的消费品已经达到了二百种，其中有各种收音机、真空吸尘器、电气冰箱、电气茶壶等。
