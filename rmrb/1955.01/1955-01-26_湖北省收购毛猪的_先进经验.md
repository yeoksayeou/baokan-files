Hubei Province's "Advanced Experience" in Purchasing Live Pigs
		Botao

After the autumn of last year, the China Food Company's Hubei Provincial Branch convened the first provincial conference of storage and transportation section (division) chiefs. The conference focused on "implementing the spirit of the General Company's August National Storage and Transportation Section Chiefs Conference, combining it with the current practical situation in our province, doing a good job of 'three major support efforts,' carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy... further improving business management so that storage and transportation work can adapt to the needs of the objective situation." (See "Summary of the First Provincial Conference of Storage and Transportation Section (Division) Chiefs of the China Food Company's Hubei Provincial Branch") "At this conference, work was reviewed, experiences were exchanged, and necessary and feasible systems were formulated." (Ibid.)

At this conference, experiences were indeed "exchanged." These included Wang Shixian's experience in improving egg loading; advanced experiences in loading pigs onto trains, etc. However, some capitalist management methods were also exchanged as
"experience," and were made into "necessary and feasible systems." One of these was the implementation of the "empty trough system" for purchasing live pigs. This involves starving the pigs that farmers bring to sell for several hours, to prevent them from having food in their stomachs that would add to their weight. "In principle, the standard is four to six hours. Localities can appropriately shorten or extend this time based on the actual condition of the pigs. During the empty trough period, the pigs should be frequently driven around to urinate and defecate, reducing their weight (Ibid.)." Another point was the implementation of a "physical examination method" for purchasing live pigs. This involves hitting the pig with a stick to see how it reflexes. Although this point was not written in the document, it was not criticized. The conference also pointed out: Localities "must not mix large and small pigs for transport. Fat pigs weighing over 120 catties with a backfat thickness of over 2 cm should be delivered to the Danshuichi Livestock Receiving Point; pigs weighing between 100 and 120 catties should be delivered to the Qiaokou Livestock Receiving Group."

Because the purchase of live pigs is not done solely by the food company, but also by other state-owned stores and supply and marketing cooperatives, the above-mentioned "advanced experience" could not be fully "implemented" only within the food company system. Therefore, this "summary" was sent to the Hubei Provincial Department of Commerce for approval and circulation. The Department of Commerce endorsed it with "The summary of the Provincial Food Company's Storage and Transportation Section (Division) Chiefs Conference has been reviewed by this department and is approved for distribution. Please study and implement it." It was issued as an official document.

After this document was issued, localities all condensed the 7,400-word summary into a few hundred words about the "empty trough system" and "physical examination method" for purchasing live pigs, and earnestly promoted them; and in many places, they were even "developed." Let's take Huanggang Prefecture as an example first! The notice from the Huanggang Branch of the China Food Company stated: "Live pigs weighing less than 120 catties will be stopped from being purchased." Although there was no such provision in the "summary." The Songbu Store of the Huanggang Branch even emphasized in its notice: "When purchasing, we will resolutely not accept pigs with full troughs. Moreover, before weighing, we must poke the pig's neck with a stick to see how strong its reflexes are." Pigs with weak reflexes "will not be purchased." As a result of the implementation of this regulation, pigs that had been driven from afar, after being starved for four hours, were already mentally exhausted, and many were deemed "not up to standard" after being hit with a stick.

Jingzhou Prefecture was no exception. On September 20th last year, the Mianyang Store forwarded a notice from the Jingzhou Branch of the Food Company, pointing out: "Small pigs weighing less than 120 catties will immediately stop being purchased. Live pigs must start at 121 catties." As for the fact that people in disaster areas have difficult lives, lack feed, and need to sell live pigs to expand production investment, they do not pay attention to it. In addition to instructing "designated locations to purchase 100 to 130 catties, and no other units will purchase" the Xiangfan Branch of the China Food Company also stipulated: "Resolutely do not accept full-trough big-bellied pigs, boars... changed pork, folded-skin pigs, Kelang pigs (i.e., large frames, enough weight, thin pigs without meat)"; it also stipulated a deduction method, deducting about ten catties of "full trough" from a pig.

Now, the source of live pigs has basically been grasped by state-owned commercial departments. Farmers mostly deal with state-owned commercial departments when selling live pigs. This is of course a good thing that is beneficial to farmers. But the promotion of this "experience," the issuance of documents, and the fact that everyone has seriously implemented it, has increased a lot of inconvenience and even losses to live pig producers, reduced farmers' enthusiasm for raising pigs, and affected the relationship between the Party and the state and the farmers. Here, let's take Xianning County in Xiaogan Prefecture as an example. There was an old lady in Xianning Township who drove a live pig to the Shuangxi Bridge Cooperative in Xianning Fourth District to sell it in November last year. The pig weighed more than 120 catties. The staff of the cooperative wanted to implement the "empty trough system" and asked the old lady to wait eight hours before weighing it. After eight hours passed, the staff got off work, and the old lady had to spend thousands of yuan to find a store to stay in. The next day, she went to sell it again, but the pig was less than 120 catties. The staff said that the "weight was not up to standard" and refused to purchase it. The pig was so cold and hungry that it could not move. The old lady had to hire two people to carry the pig back home. The pig was frozen and starved for a day and a night, and was carried a long way. The old lady was afraid that it would not live long after returning home, so she killed it. After killing it, the old lady cried loudly and vowed never to raise pigs again. The neighbors expressed deep sympathy for the old lady and complained one after another. As for the production time that farmers lost due to empty troughs when selling pigs, it is impossible to calculate. According to the plan of the Hubei Provincial Branch of the China Food Company in November last year, the province was to purchase 85,000 live pigs. Not counting the "empty trough for six hours" (some places stipulate eight hours), but calculating at least four hours, and with half of the pigs being subjected to the empty trough system, in this month alone, farmers lost 170,000 hours just at the purchasing points. This caused too much loss to farmers in production. No wonder farmers criticized them: "You should check your attitude of 'serving the needs of production and people's consumption'"; "Oppose bureaucracy!"

How should we answer the criticisms from the masses? This question can only be answered by the负责人 (responsible persons) of the Hubei Provincial Branch of the China Food Company and the Hubei Provincial Department of Commerce, which approved and circulated this "summary of experience."

    湖北省收购毛猪的“先进经验”
    波涛
    去年秋后，中国食品公司湖北省公司召开了第一届全省储运课（股）长会议。会议的中心是“贯彻总公司八月全国储运课长会议精神，结合我省当前实际情况，搞好‘三大支援’，开展增产节约运动……更进一步改善经营管理，使储运工作能够适应客观形势的需要”。（见“中国食品公司湖北省公司第一届全省储运课（股）长会议总结”）“在这次会议中着重检查了工作，交流了经验，制订了必要的可行制度”。（同前）
    在这次会议上，的确曾经“交流了经验”。其中有王世贤改进蛋品装车的经验；火车装猪法的先进经验等。但是也交流了些资本主义经营方式的
  “经验”，并把它制成了“必要的可行制度”了。其中有一件是收购毛猪实行“考槽制”。就是把农民赶来出售的猪，饿上几个钟头，以免肚子里有食物，占了重量。“原则上以四小时至六小时为标准。各地根据猪的实际情况，可以适当缩短和延长。在考槽时间内，应经常赶猪走动，使猪泄出屎尿，减轻体重。（同前）”另一点是收购毛猪实行“体格检查法”。就是打猪一棍子，看猪的反射性能怎么样。这点虽然没有写在文件上，但并没有受到批判。会议还指出：各地“不得将大小猪混合装运。凡在一百二十斤以上的肥猪，膘厚二公分以上，交丹水池牲猪接交处；一百二十斤以下，一百斤以上的猪，交桥口牲猪接交组”。
    因为收购毛猪这件事并非只由食品公司去做，还有其他国营商店和供销合作社收购或代购，上述的“先进经验”只在食品公司系统内是不能完全“贯彻”的。所以这个“总结”就送交湖北省商业厅去批转。商业厅就批上“省食品公司储运课（股）长会议总结，经本厅审查，同意印发，希予研究执行”字样。作为正式公文下达了。
    这个公文下达后，各地都把长达七千四百字的总结，缩成几百字的收购毛猪的“考槽制”和“体格检查法”，切实认真地加以推广了；并且很多地方还有所“发挥”。这里先以黄冈专区为例吧！中国食品公司黄冈分公司的通知中说：“一百二十斤以下的牲猪，一律停止收购。”虽然“总结”中并没有这个规定。黄冈分公司宋埠商店在通知中更强调指出：“收购时，坚决不收饱槽猪。而且在过秤之前要用棍子在猪的颈部一戳，看其反射性强弱。”反射性弱的猪“就不收购”。这一规定执行的结果，那些远路赶来的猪，再饿上四个钟头，精神已经疲劳，一棍之下，很多也就“不合规格”了。
    荆州专区也没有例外。去年九月二十日沔阳商店转发食品公司荆州分公司的通知中指出：“一百二十斤以下的小猪立即停止收购。毛猪必须以一百二十一斤为起点。”至于灾区人民生活困难，饲料缺乏，需要出售毛猪，扩大生产投资，他们是不加理会的。中国食品公司襄樊分公司除了指示“指定地点收购一百斤至一百三十斤，其余单位概不收购”外，并规定：“坚决不收饱槽大肚猪，公猪……改敲猪，摺皮猪，克郎猪（即架子大，重量够，没有肉的瘦猪）”；还规定了除秤办法，一头猪要扣除十斤左右的“饱槽”。
    现在，毛猪的货源已经基本上为国营商业部门掌握了。农民出售毛猪，大部分都是同国营商业部门打交道。这当然是一件对农民有利的好事情。但这个“经验”的推广，文件的下达，并且大家都认真执行的结果，就给毛猪生产者增加了很多的不便以至损失，降低了农民养猪的积极性，影响了党和国家同农民的关系。这里且举孝感专区的咸宁县为例。咸宁乡下有个老妈妈，去年十一月间赶了一头毛猪到咸宁四区双喜桥合作社去卖，猪重一百二十多斤。合作社的工作人员要实行“考槽制”，让老妈妈等八个钟头以后再过秤，八个钟头过去了，工作人员下了班，老妈妈只得花几千元找了个店住下。第二天又去卖，猪已不足一百二十斤了，工作人员说是“体重不合”，拒绝收购。猪子冻饿得走不动了，老妈妈只得雇了两个人把猪抬回家去。这猪冻饿了一天一夜，又给抬了大远的路，回家后怕活不长，老妈妈就把它杀了。杀完以后老妈妈大哭一场，发誓不再养猪。四邻对老妈妈深表同情，纷纷埋怨。至于农民卖猪因考槽而耽误的生产时间，那就无法计算了。去年十一月份按中国食品公司湖北省公司计划，全省要收购八万五千头毛猪。不以“考槽六小时”（有的地方规定八小时），而按最少四小时，有半数的猪实行考槽计算，在这一个月中，农民只在收购处耽误的时间就是十七万个小时。这给农民造成生产上的损失实在是太大了。难怪农民批评他们：“你们应该检查检查‘为生产和人民消费需要服务’的态度”；“反一反官僚主义吧！”
    到底怎样回答来自群众中间的批评呢？这个问题只有请中国食品公司湖北省公司的负责人和批转这个“经验总结”的湖北省商业厅去解答了。
