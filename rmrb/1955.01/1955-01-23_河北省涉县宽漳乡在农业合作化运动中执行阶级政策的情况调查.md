Editor's Note: From this investigative material, we can see the specific situation and problems of a township in the old liberated area in implementing the Party's class policy in rural areas, as well as the different attitudes of farmers of various strata towards agricultural producers' cooperatives and the various different ideological situations for joining the cooperatives. These situations show that, whether in new cooperatives or old cooperatives, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the class line, carefully select the leading backbone of the cooperatives, and strengthen the ideological leadership of the working class.

Kuanchang Township in She County, Hebei Province, is a township in the old liberated area with a relatively good work foundation and mutual aid foundation. The township has five natural villages, 1,306 households, and a total of eighteen new and old agricultural producers' cooperatives. 950 peasant households have joined the cooperatives, accounting for 72.7% of the total number of households. There are sixteen mutual aid groups, with a total of 252 households. More than 90% of the farmers in the township have been organized.

I. The Situation of Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives and Mutual Aid Groups

Of the twelve old cooperatives in the township, three were established in 1952, and five cooperatives had more than 70 households. The original number of households was 455. In 1954, 283 households were added, for a total of 738 cooperative members, accounting for 56.5% of the total number of households in the township. The yield of the cooperatives is generally about 10 jin per mu higher than that of individual farmers, and the income of most cooperative members has increased after joining the cooperatives. Last autumn, each labor day was distributed a maximum of 7,739 yuan and a minimum of 4,700 yuan, and each standard mu was distributed a maximum of 75,000 yuan and a minimum of 40,000 yuan. No cooperative members have requested to withdraw from the cooperatives in the past two years. The biggest problem with the old cooperatives at present is that the income of cooperative members has increased, but the "foundation is empty and the strength is small," and the socialist factors are increasing slowly. The middle peasants support it, but the poor peasants have opinions. If the current situation is not gradually changed, the cooperatives that have increased production are also in danger of collapsing. The main problems are the following four aspects:

1.  Leadership Backbone: According to a survey of the composition of 27 cooperative chairmen, vice-chairmen, and accountants, 15 were old middle peasants, 11 were new middle peasants, and 1 was a poor peasant. The best "May 2nd" and "Samsung" cooperatives in the township, the eight main cadres are all old middle peasants. Under their leadership, the following problems exist within the cooperatives: (1) Falsely reporting yields. The actual yield of the "May 2nd" cooperative was 200 jin per mu, but after repeated mobilization during this grain purchase, it was finally reported as only 170 jin, which had a very bad impact. (2) Squeezing out households in difficulty. Setting excessively high investment fees, making it impossible for poor peasants and households in difficulty to participate. (3) Unwilling to accumulate public property. The "May 2nd" and other five cooperatives collectively reclaimed wasteland, and the 3,020 jin of hemp and 2,800 jin of grain harvested were all distributed according to labor days. (4) Advocating that all means of production should be entered into the cooperative at high prices, which the cooperative cannot afford. In essence, all means of production are maintained as private property and not entered into the cooperative at all.

2.  Distribution: The total income of the cooperative is distributed according to "four legs": livestock, investment, labor, and land. The distribution ratio based on labor cannot be achieved. The income of cooperative members varies greatly due to the presence or absence of livestock and investment. Last autumn, Fan Bingyuan and other three leading households (rich middle peasants) in Qiankuanchang Village each received an average of 3,293,570 yuan. General middle peasant households with livestock, labor, and land each received an average of 2,213,300 yuan. Households without livestock, little investment, and only labor and land (including poor peasants) received an average of 960,000 yuan.

3.  Handling of Means of Production: Livestock are all evaluated, recorded work points, and compensated for. The best livestock are rated at 15 points, the average at 12 points, and the least at 10 points, with an average daily wage of 6,000 yuan. A livestock animal can earn a maximum wage of more than 600,000 yuan a year, and an average of 400,000 yuan. Each livestock animal can earn a net profit of about one-quarter in addition to grass and feed. Therefore, some of the wealthier cooperative members bought livestock after joining the cooperative. Farm tools are all rented at a price, and compensation is made for damage. The five cooperatives spent 1,444,900 yuan on rental fees last autumn. Cooperative members also retain a lot of private land, with private plots accounting for 13.5% of the land entered into the cooperative. In addition, each household has three, five, or even more than ten mu of barren hillside land. Only a little land is cooperated, and other means of production are privately owned. These cooperatives have very few socialist factors. What will happen if this kind of cooperation continues? The local cadres are not clear about their thinking, and only know that a certain percentage of farmers have joined the cooperatives on the surface.

4.  Production Investment: Fertilizer is priced at a maximum of 2,300 yuan per dan and generally 1,700 yuan. A shepherd is paid 3,500 yuan per day, and a dog is paid 2,500 yuan. Providing meals is considered an investment. Most of the households providing meals are middle peasant households. Calculated in this way, the maximum investment is 800,000 yuan a year, and the average is 200,000 yuan.

As a result, labor income is relatively reduced, the middle peasants are happy, and the poor peasants are dissatisfied. The middle peasants reflect: "Joining the cooperative is economically beneficial and politically glorious." The poor peasants reflect: "If we continue like this for two years, the cooperative will still be empty, the poor will still be poor. If there is a bad year, the cooperative will have no way, and we will still have no way."

The mutual aid groups in the township are actually mostly just a formality. The eight groups we investigated have the following two situations: One is that the orphaned, widowed, elderly, weak, and households in difficulty, as well as the former landlords and rich peasants, are excluded from the cooperatives. The village cadres organize them into groups. The three groups in Qiankuanchang and Houkuanchang have a total of 54 households, including 1 landlord household, 3 rich peasant households, 14 elderly men, 8 widows, 4 single men, 5 "two-headed growers" (who also cultivate some land in Shanxi), 2 disabled people, 1 shepherd household, 5 military dependents and cadre family members without labor, 5 households without land, and 5 households living on old-age support. The leaders of two groups are former rich peasants who were struggled against. The masses call these groups "seven old and eight young, remnants of soldiers." They generally want to join the cooperatives, but the agricultural producers' cooperatives do not want them. At the same time, the welfare fund in the cooperative is too small to solve the difficulties of these people. The other type is groups formed by old middle peasants who are unwilling to join the cooperatives. The five groups in Yangjiashan have 71 households, including 40 middle peasant households, 4 merchant households, 5 households living on old-age support, 13 new middle peasant households, and 5 poor peasant households. The agricultural producers' cooperatives welcome them, but they themselves do not join. Some want to wait two or three years to see how things go before joining. These groups actually do not play any role.

II. Class Situation

The Party's class policy in rural areas has only been mentioned once or twice within the Party in this township and has not been publicized to the masses. The district and village cadres know that landlords and rich peasants cannot join the cooperatives now, but are not clear about anything else. The current situation of each class is roughly as follows:

1.  Poor Peasants: Last year, when the cooperatives were expanded and established, half a door was opened, and poor peasants with labor were absorbed into the cooperatives, but households in difficulty without labor were still excluded. In Kuanchang Village, the existing poor peasants (excluding old poor peasants who have risen to become new middle peasants) account for 8.2% of the total number of households, and in Yangjiashan, they account for 7.2% of the total number of households. Most of these people are poor due to empty foundations, increased population, illness, and death. They actively want to join the cooperatives and want to turn over again, but they also have concerns. They have three obstacles to joining the cooperatives: The first is whether the application can be approved; the second is that even if it is approved, they are afraid that they cannot afford the membership fee; and the third is that after joining the cooperative, they are afraid that they cannot go out to make ends meet (do odd jobs, etc.). The status of poor peasants who have joined the cooperative is very low, and their opinions are rarely sought within the cooperative. Their status is also not high outside the cooperative. General opinion is that they "do not work hard, do not know how to manage, are not active in anything, and are hopelessly backward." The cadres also have this view.

2.  Middle Peasants: Rich Middle Peasants: According to rough statistics, there are 14 households in Yangjiashan Village, accounting for 3.5% of the total number of households in the village. They demand freedom in economic development and express dissatisfaction and resistance to the unified purchase and sale. Only 4 of the 14 households in the village have joined the cooperative, and not voluntarily. These households are currently not planning to hire long-term workers or buy land, and are concentrating on building houses and purchasing coffins and shrouds. Among them, nine households have newly built 25 rooms (a two-story building is counted as two rooms) and 20 cave dwellings in the past two or three years, and are also preparing to build 9 rooms, 4 cave dwellings, and a courtyard.

General Old Middle Peasants: Those who have joined the cooperative are mainly households with strong labor and livestock but little land. Those who have not joined the cooperative are mainly households with relatively strong labor and livestock and more land. They generally do not need to ask for help from others for anything. They are afraid of suffering losses and being restrained after joining the cooperative. The district and village leading cadres accommodate the middle peasants in everything, fearing that the middle peasants will suffer losses, and neglect the aspect of educating and transforming them.

3.  Landlords and Rich Peasants: There are 26 landlord and former rich peasant households (3 landlord households and 23 rich peasant households) in Qiankuanchang and Yangjiashan. After the land reform, some do petty business, act as grain peddlers, and engage in speculation. Others have a lot of labor, tend sheep, and cultivate land, and have developed rapidly in the land left to them in recent years. Currently, 10 households are living like rich middle peasants, 13 households are living like general middle peasants, and only 3 households are living relatively poorly. So far, 4 households have bought a total of 12.5 mu of land, 5 households have built 10 cave dwellings and 9 rooms, and 14 households have bought 13 livestock animals and 2 households have bought 80 sheep. They are ostensibly "actively requesting to join the cooperative, and come whenever they are called," but inwardly they think "it's not a problem not to join, and it suits my heart not to be called to join." When the cooperative was established last year, they actively applied to join, but none were approved. These people pretend to be enlightened, active, and honest politically. Therefore, the village cadres, party members, and the masses think that they are "rattles, turning with the hand, doing whatever we say," "good leaders, obeying commands," "having a lot of tricks, knowing how to create trouble for others, and knowing how to manage." Therefore, they have relaxed their vigilance against these people.

III. Farmers' Ideological Situation

Recently, when the old cooperatives were expanded and new cooperatives were established, the superiority of the old cooperatives was not summarized to educate the cooperative members. They only talked about socialist principles and did not talk about production. In the six newly established and expanded cooperatives in the township, more than a month after the expansion and establishment of the cooperatives, production plans have not yet been formulated, and production has not been carried out. The cooperative members' enthusiasm for production is not high.

1.  Old Cooperative Members: Although they have undergone one or two years of collective production, their ideological awareness is still not high enough. The number of people who truly want to run the cooperative wholeheartedly is not the majority. Generally, there are three attitudes: The first is to actively run the cooperative well, accounting for about 40% of the total number of old cooperative members. The second is to join the cooperative in order to earn wages and get more dividends, advocating dividing as much as possible, accounting for about 35.2%. The third is to follow along, accounting for about 24.8%.

2.  New Cooperative Members: 1. Those who voluntarily and actively join the cooperative account for 47% of the total number of new cooperative members. These are mainly party members, members of the Communist Youth League, households with production difficulties, and family members of revolutionary soldiers and cadres. Their active entry into the cooperative stems from the following ideas: responding to the Party's call, taking the socialist road, relying on the state, and relying on agricultural producers' cooperatives to live a good life. 2. Those who originally had ideological problems and joined the cooperative after mobilization and persuasion account for 13%. These are mainly households with a lot of land and weak labor, as well as households living on old-age support. They want to join the cooperative, but they have various concerns, fearing that joining the cooperative will be a loss, fearing that the grain distributed after joining the cooperative will not be enough to eat, etc. They join the agricultural cooperative after accounting and persuasion. 3. Those who "follow the crowd" account for 40%. There are the following types of people: A. They do not take the lead in forming the cooperative, but follow along in running the cooperative. Most of them are new middle peasants who have become relatively wealthy after turning over. They are not progressing quickly ideologically, but they have turned over under the leadership of the Party and have lived a good life. If they do not join the cooperative, they are letting down the Party. If they join, they are afraid of suffering losses, being restrained, and not being free because they are doing quite well on their own. Therefore, they adopt an attitude of following along. B. Taking the right path, following the trend, and catching up with "society." Many of these people have always followed wherever "society" leads. They know that the socialist road must be taken, and it is better to take it early than late. They are afraid of being said to be backward, and believe that following everyone else will not lead them astray. C. Going with the wind. These people turn west when the east wind blows, and turn east when the west wind blows. They run wherever there are more people. When the cooperative was being tried out, they resolutely did not participate. Last year, when it was first called for, they were still unwilling. But seeing that many people had registered, and some people's applications were not approved, they joined the agricultural producers' cooperative again. D. Looking both ways. These households feel that they will suffer a bit by working with the poor peasants, and looking up, they see that households with mules and are stronger than them have joined the cooperative, so they think: Others are not starving to death, can we starve to death? We have to follow "society" even if we suffer a bit and endure a bit of pain. E. Waiting and seeing. Some of these households originally wanted to harvest a season of wheat before joining, and some wanted to wait a year to see how it was being run before joining, feeling that although the old cooperatives had increased production, it was not certain whether the new cooperatives could increase production. It was not too late to join in a year. But with cooperatives being formed in every village and households signing up, seeing that the situation was not right, they joined the cooperative after mobilization and explanation by the cadres.

3.  Farmers Outside the Cooperative: There are still more than 350 households in the township that have not joined the cooperative. In addition to a few landlords and rich peasants who have been struggled against, there are three types of people: (1) Rich Middle Peasants: They are economically "three strong." According to a survey of nine rich middle peasant households in Yangjiashan, there are a total of 55 people, with an average of 2.8 mu of land per person (She County has many mountains and little land, and the average farmer has about 2 mu of cultivated land per person), 5 mules, 6 donkeys, and many fruit trees on the hillside land. These people are currently refusing to join the cooperative, and also say: "We don't need to ask for help from others for ten or eight years. We don't need help from the state, and we don't need help from neighbors." Some say: "I will only join when all the farmers in China have joined the cooperative and there is not a single household working on its own." Some have a smaller tone: "I will only join when one household is left in the whole village." Others say: "After I die, my children will join." (2) General Middle Peasants: They feel flustered and uncertain when they see that others have joined, fearing that they will be organized together with landlords and rich peasants, and also fearing that they will suffer losses after joining the cooperative, because they are also "households that don't need to ask for help from others for anything." Their main idea at present is "to drag on for a year if possible, and to drag on for a season if possible." (3) Households in Difficulty and a Small Number of Poor Peasants: Most of them want to join but cannot join. Some applications have not been approved, and a few are waiting to register and join when the cooperative is expanded. Most are pessimistic and disappointed, thinking: "There is no way out in the old society, and there is no way out in the new society. The socialist road is the road of others."

    河北省涉县宽漳乡在农业合作化运动中执行阶级政策的情况调查
    其瑞  秀英
    编者按：从这个调查材料里，我们可以看到老解放区一个乡具体贯彻党在农村的阶级政策的情况和问题，以及各阶层农民对农业生产合作社的不同态度和入社的各种不同思想情况。这些情况说明，不论新社或老社，都必须认真贯彻阶级路线，慎重选择社的领导骨干，加强工人阶级思想领导。
    河北省涉县宽漳乡是老解放区的一个乡，工作基础和互助基础都比较好。全乡五个自然村，一千三百零六户，共有新、老农业生产合作社十八个，入社农户九百五十户，占总农户百分之七十二点七；有互助组十六个，共二百五十二户。全乡百分之九十以上的农户已经组织起来。
    一、农业生产合作社和互助组的情况
    全乡十二个老社，一九五二年成立的有三个，七十户以上的社有五个。原有户数四百五十五户，一九五四年扩大了二百八十三户，共有社员七百三十八户，占全乡总户数百分之五十六点五。社的产量一般比个体农民每亩增产十斤左右，绝大部分社员入社后收入都有增加；去秋每个劳动日最多分七千七百三十九元，最少分四千七百元，每个标准亩最多分七万五千元，最少分四万元。二年来没有社员要求退社。目前老社的最大问题是社员收入增加，但是社的“底子空、力量小”，社会主义因素增加的慢；中农拥护，贫农有意见。如不逐步改变现有状况，增了产的合作社也有垮台的危险。主要问题有以下四个方面：
    1、领导骨干问题：据二十七个正副社长和会计的成份调查，老中农十五人，新中农十一人，贫农一人。全乡最好的“五二”、“三星”两社，八个主要干部全是老中农。在他们的领导下，社内存在以下问题：（1）假报产量。“五二”社每亩实产二百斤，这次购粮经再三动员，最后只报一百七十斤，影响很坏。（2）排挤困难户。规定过高的投资费，使贫农和困难户无法参加。（3）不愿积累公共财产。“五二”等五个社，社员集体开荒，收大麻三千零二十斤，粮食二千八百斤，统统按劳动日分掉了。（4）主张生产资料一律高价入社，社背不起，实质是一切生产资料维持私有，一律都不入社。
    2、分配问题：社内总收入是按牲畜、投资、劳力、土地“四条腿”分了，以劳为主的分红比例不能实现，社员收入因有无牲畜和投资不同，相差很大。前宽漳村樊炳源等三个首户（富裕中农），去秋每户平均分三百二十九万三千五百七十元。一般有牲畜、劳力、土地的中农户，每户平均分二百二十一万三千三百元。无牲畜，投资不多，只有劳力、土地的户（包括贫农）平均分九十六万元。
    3、生产资料的处理：耕畜一律采取评分、记工、出代价的办法，最好的牲畜十五分，一般的十二分，最少的十分，平均每天工资六千元。一个耕畜最多一年可赚工资六十多万，一般的赚四十万，大约每头牲畜除草料外可净赚四分之一。因此有些较富裕的社员入社后又买了牲口。农具一律是采取作价出赁，坏了赔偿，私有公用的办法。五个社去年秋季开支赁费即达一百四十四万四千九百元。社员自留土地也很多，自留地占入社地百分之十三点五。此外，户户都有三、五亩甚至十多亩荒坡地。仅有一点土地合作，其他生产资料都是私有，这些社的社会主义因素很少，这样合作下去是个什么样子？当地干部思想也不明确，只知道表面上有百分之几十农户入社了。
    4、生产投资问题：肥料规定每担最高二千三百元，一般一千七百元。管放羊的每人每天三千五百元，狗二千五百元。管了饭就算投资。管饭的多是中农户。这样算下来，投资最多的一年达八十多万元，一般的二十万元。
    这样做的结果，劳动收入相对减少，中农高兴，贫农不满。中农反映：“入社经济上有利，政治上光荣。”贫农反映：“这样再闹二年，社还是底子空，穷人还是穷，遭个年景，社没办法，自己也还是没办法。”
    全乡的互助组实际上大都是空有个形式。我们调查的八个组，有以下两种情况：一种是被关到社外的孤寡老弱困难户和旧地主、富农，村干部把他们编成组。前后宽漳三个组共五十四户，其中地主一户，富农三户，老头十四户，寡妇八户，独身男子四户，“两头种”（在山西还种着些地）五户，残废二户，放羊的一户，无劳力的军属和干部家属五户，家中无人有地的五户，吃养老的五户，其他一户；有两个组的组长是被斗旧富农。群众叫这样的组是“七老八少，残兵败将”。他们一般愿入社但是农业生产合作社却不要他们。同时社内公益金太少，确实解决不了这些人的困难。另一种是不愿入社的老中农结成的组。杨家山五个组七十一户，其中有中农四十户，商人有四户，吃养老的五户，新中农十三户，贫农五户；农业生产合作社欢迎他们，他们自己不入，有的要等二、三年看一看再入。这些组实际上都不起什么作用。
    二、阶级情况
    党在农村中的阶级政策，在这个乡只是在党内说过一、二次，还没宣传到群众中去。区村干部知道地主富农现在不能入社，别的不清楚。目前各阶层的情况大体是这样：
    1、贫农：去年扩社建社，开了半个门，吸收有劳力的贫农入社，但无劳力的困难户仍被关到门外。宽漳村现有贫农（不包括上升为新中农的老贫农）占总农户百分之八点二，杨家山占总农户百分之七点二。这些人多数是因底子空、增加人口、疾病、死亡而贫困的。他们积极要求入社，想再翻个身，但又有顾虑。他们入社有三关：第一关是申请是否能批准；第二关是即使批准入社，怕出不起入社费；第三关是入了社怕不能出去赶嘴（打短工等）。入了社的贫农地位很低，社内很少征求他们的意见。在社外的地位也不高，一般舆论认为他们“不好好劳动，不会经营，干啥也不积极，死落后”。干部也有这种看法。
    2、中农：富裕中农：据粗略统计，杨家山村有十四户，占全村总户数百分之三点五。他们在经济上要求自由发展，对统购统销表现一种不满和抵抗情绪。全村十四户中只有四户入了社，但并不自愿。这些户目前暂不准备雇长工、买土地，正在集中力量修建房屋，置买棺材寿衣等。其中九户两三年来新盖房二十五间（楼房一间算两间），窑二十孔，还准备盖房九间，窑四孔，院一所。
    一般老中农：已入社的主要是劳力畜力强，土地不多的户。未入社的主要是劳力畜力较强，土地较多的户，他们一般也是干啥不用求人，入了社怕吃亏又怕受拘束。区村领导干部对中农遇事迁就，怕中农吃亏，忽视对他们教育改造的一面。
    3、地主富农：前宽漳、杨家山共有地主、旧富农二十六户（地主三户、富农二十三户），土地改革以后，有的做小买卖，当粮食贩，投机捣鬼；有的劳力多，放羊、种地，在留给自己的土地上努力劳动，几年来发展很快。现在有十户相当于富裕中农生活，十三户相当于一般中农生活，只有三户生活较差。到目前为止，有四户共买地十二点五亩，有五户修窑十孔，盖房九间，十四户买牲畜十三头，二户买羊八十只。他们表面上是“积极要求入社，叫来就来”，内心是“不入也不发愁，不叫入正合自己心眼”。去年建社时，他们积极申请入社，都没批准。这些人政治上装开明、装积极、装老实，因此村干部、党员、群众认为他们是“拨浪鼓，随手转，咱们怎说他怎干”，“好领导，听指挥”，“心眼儿多，会闹人家，会经营”，因而对这些人放松了警惕。
    三、农民思想情况
    最近在老社扩大和新社建立时，根本没有总结老社的优越性去教育社员，老讲社会主义大道理，不谈生产。全乡六个新建社和扩建社，扩社建社后一个多月，还没有订生产计划，没有进行生产，社员生产情绪不高。
    1、老社员：虽然经过一二年集体生产，但思想觉悟仍不够高，真正全心全意要把社办好的人不占多数。一般有三种态度：第一种是积极要把社办好的，约占老社员总数的百分之四十。第二种是为了赚工资多分红而入社的，主张有多少分多少，约占百分之三十五点二。第三种是跟着跑的，约占百分之二十四点八。
    2、新社员：一、自愿积极入社的占新社员总数的百分之四十七。主要是党员团员和生产有困难户以及革命军人、干部家属。他们积极入社的思想是：响应党的号召，走社会主义的路，依靠国家，依靠农业生产合作社来过好时光。二、原来思想不通，经过动员说服后入社的占百分之十三。主要是地多劳力弱的以及吃养老的户。他们想入社，但又有各种顾虑，怕入社吃亏，怕入社分的粮食不够吃等，经算账、劝解而加入农业社。三、“随大流”的占百分之四十。有以下几种人：甲、成社不带头，办社跟着走。他们多是翻身后较富裕的新中农，思想上进步不快，但在党的领导下翻了身，把时光过好了，不入社，对不起党；入吧，因自己时光闹的挺好，又怕吃亏、拘束、不自由，因此采取跟着走的态度。乙、走正路、随潮流、赶“社会”。这些人不少从来是“社会”赶到那里跟到那里。他们知道社会主义这条路非走不行，迟走不如早走，怕说落后，认为随着大家走没错路。丙、随风倒。这些人是东风来了往西倒，西风来了往东倒，那里人多往那里跑。试办社时，他们坚决不参加；去年刚号召时还不愿意；但看见很多人都报了名，有些人申请还不批准，他们就又加入了农业生产合作社。丁、两头瞧。他们往下瞧觉得和贫农共事要吃点亏，往上瞧看见有骡子的比咱强的户都入了社，就想：饿不死人家，光能饿死咱？吃点亏，忍点痛也得跟“社会”走。戊、等等看。这些户原来有的想收一季麦再入，有的想等一年看看办的怎样再入，觉得老社虽增了产，新社是否能增产不保险，等一年再入不迟。但村村成社，户户报名，看见形势不对，经干部动员解释也就入了社。
    3、社外农民：全乡没有入社的还有三百五十多户，除少数被斗过的地主、富农外，还有三种人：（1）富裕中农：他们经济上是“三强”，据杨家山九户富裕中农调查，共五十五口人，每人平均二点八亩地（涉县山多地少，一般农户平均每人约有二亩耕地），有五头骡，六头驴，山坡地果木树很多。这些人目前拒绝入社，还表示：“我们十年八年不用求人，一不用国家帮助，二不用邻居帮忙。”有的表示：“全中国农民都入社，没有一户单干，俺才入。”有的口气小些：“全村留下一户俺才入。”还有的说：“我死了以后，俺孩子再入。”（2）一般中农：他们看见人家入了，心慌害怕，动摇不定，怕和地主、富农组织到一块，又怕入社吃亏，因为他们也是“干啥也不用求人的户”，目前主要思想是“能拖一年算一年，能拖一季算一季”。（3）困难户和少数贫农：他们多数是想入而入不了，有的申请未批准，少数等待扩社时报名加入，多数悲观失望，认为：“旧社会无出路，新社会也无出路，社会主义的路是人家的路。”
