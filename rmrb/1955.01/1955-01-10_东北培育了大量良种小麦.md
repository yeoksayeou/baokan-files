    Northeast State Farm Administration's directly affiliated farms, through several years of effort, have cultivated thirteen kinds of improved wheat seeds, totaling more than 3,900 tons, enough to sow 24,000 hectares of wheat this year. By this autumn, they can be propagated to the point where they are sufficient to sow 300,000 hectares of land. The characteristics of these excellent varieties are: rust-resistant, moisture-resistant, not prone to lodging, and suitable for the local natural conditions, resulting in high yields. Last year, these wheat varieties yielded 42 percent more than ordinary varieties. The "Gansu No. 96" wheat sown on 405 hectares by the 93rd Farm yielded an average of 1,900 kilograms per hectare, an increase of 56 percent over ordinary wheat.

    东北培育了大量良种小麦
    东北国营农场管理局直属各农场经过几年来的努力，培育出小麦优良种籽十三种计三千九百多吨，可够今年播种小麦两万四千公顷。到今年秋天就可以繁殖到足够播种三十万公顷的土地面积。这些优良品种的特点是：抗锈耐湿，不易倒伏，适合于当地的自然条件，因而产量很高。去年这些小麦比一般的产量高出百分之四十二，九三农场播种的四百零五公顷“甘肃九十六号”小麦，平均每公顷产量达一千九百公斤，比一般小麦增产百分之五十六。　　（丁履枢）
