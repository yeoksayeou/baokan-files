Xinhua News Agency, January 29th dispatch from Washington: United States Independent Senator Morse opposed in the Senate the proposal to authorize the American president to use armed forces against the People's Republic of China under the pretext of "defending" Taiwan and other Chinese islands. Morse released letters he received in which American voters demanded Congress reject the proposal.

    Gross of Los Angeles wrote in a letter: "Please do not give the President the power to interfere in China's civil war. We see no logical, rational, or moral basis for such action."

    Romey of Cleveland demanded in his letter: "Under no circumstances should an attack on the Chinese mainland be permitted."

    Russo of Portland (in Oregon) said in his letter: "Dulles' policy will lead to devastating consequences for itself. War measures and military adventures cannot be disguised as means of supporting peace. I ask you to oppose the implementation of reckless war threats, to oppose the loss of our prestige in Asia and throughout the world, and to oppose the indecent measures implemented by our government that put Congress and the entire country in an embarrassing situation."

    Fansard of Washington expressed opposition to the occupation of Taiwan by American armed forces. He wrote: "If any country occupies our coastal islands, the United States will oppose it. ... Therefore, we should withdraw from Taiwan and let the Chinese end their own civil war!" The letter continued: Voting in favor of "defending" Taiwan "is tantamount to supporting the Chiang Kai-shek clique and American privileged figures against the will of the American people." Holcomb, an American resident of Virginia, demanded that the Seventh Fleet be withdrawn from the Taiwan Strait because the American people "do not want to be dragged into a pointless and devastating war by militarists."

    Xinhua News Agency, January 29th dispatch from New York: The Progressive Party and the American Labor Party wrote letters to George, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, condemning the congressional proposal on the Taiwan issue.

    The Progressive Party Chairman Baldwin's letter refuted Eisenhower's claim that "the security of the United States is threatened in an area six thousand miles from our coast." The letter said that the passage of this proposal by Congress would greatly increase the threat of World War III and would abandon Congress's power to declare war.

    Howley, Chairman of the New York Branch of the American Labor Party, said in a letter to George, "Eisenhower's Taiwan policy contains the serious danger of causing war and causing countless Americans to lose their lives thousands of miles from our coast. The presence of the US Seventh Fleet in the waters off Taiwan is as much a threat to peace as if a Chinese fleet were stationed near the coast of Long Island (referring to the American coast)."

    美国选民要求国会拒绝干涉中国内政的提案
    进步党、劳工党谴责艾森豪威尔的战争政策
    【新华社二十九日讯】　据塔斯社华盛顿二十八日讯：美国无党派参议员莫尔斯在参议院反对授权美国总统以“保卫”台湾和其他中国岛屿为借口使用武装部队反对中华人民共和国的提案。莫尔斯公布了他所收到的信件，在这些信件中美国选民要求国会拒绝这一提案。
    洛杉矶的格罗斯在信中写道：“请您不要给予总统以干涉中国内战的权力，我们看不出这种做法有任何逻辑上的、理性上的、道义上的根据。”
    克利夫兰的罗梅伊在他的信中要求：“在任何情况下也不要准许进攻中国大陆。”
    波特兰（在俄勒冈州）的鲁索在信中说：“杜勒斯的政策会使自己得到毁灭性的后果。战争措施和军事冒险是不能冒充为支持和平的手段的。我要求您反对实行鲁莽的战争威胁，反对使我们在亚洲和全世界的威信丧失掉，反对我们政府实行的使国会和整个国家陷于狼狈不堪状况的不体面的措施。”
    华盛顿的范萨德表示反对美国武装部队侵占台湾。他写道：“如果任何国家侵占我国沿海岛屿，美国是会反对的。……因此我们就退出台湾，让中国人自己去结束内战罢！”信中接着说：投票赞成“保卫”台湾，“这就等于支持蒋介石集团和美国特权人物反对美国人民的意志”。弗吉尼亚州的美国居民霍尔康布要求把第七舰队撤出台湾海峡，因为美国人民“不愿意被军国主义者拖进一次无谓的、毁灭性的战争”。
    【新华社二十九日讯】　塔斯社纽约二十八日讯：进步党和美国劳工党分别写信给参议院外交委员会主席乔治，谴责国会关于台湾问题的提案。
    进步党主席鲍德温的信件驳斥了艾森豪威尔所谓“美国的安全在一个离开我国海岸六千英里的地区受到威胁”的说法。信件说，国会通过这个提案将大大地增加第三次世界大战的威胁，将放弃国会宣战的权力。
    美国劳工党纽约支部主席豪莱在给乔治的信中说，“艾森豪威尔的台湾政策包含着引起战争、使无数的美国人在离开我国海岸几千英里的地方丧失生命的严重危险。美国第七舰队留驻台湾海面正像如果中国舰队留驻在长岛海岸（按指美国海岸）附近一样，是对和平的威胁。”
