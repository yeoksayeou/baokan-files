    “No Detailed Accounting, No Achievements”
    ——The Experience of the State-Owned "September 3rd" Farm in Reversing Unprofitable Operations
    Ding Lüshu
    I. Where is the Problem?
    The state-owned "September 3rd" Mechanized Farm is located on the Nenjiang Grassland in Heilongjiang, with more than 14,000 hectares of cultivated land, making it the largest of China's existing state-owned farms. The farm has been established for nearly five years, and it has delivered tens of thousands of tons of grain to the state every year. However, before 1953, the farm lost money every year. The farm's employees said: "We produce so much grain and still lose money? It's a completely muddled loss!" Some employees knew that there were problems with the operation and management, but no one knew where to start to solve them.
    The farm has a relatively sound financial accounting department, but economic accounting work is only carried out in isolation at the headquarters. How much does each operation cost? How much does each crop cost? Not only do the direct production workers not know, but even the leading cadres are not clear. People only know how to produce, but they don't know how to make production profitable. The staff in the farm have a supply system mentality. Whether it is materials or property, they reach out to get it when they need it, and push it into the warehouse when they don't. At the beginning of the asset inventory and verification in early 1953, the value of the stockpiled materials alone was 6.8 billion yuan. This has resulted in serious phenomena such as large waste, high costs, and increased production with losses.
    In the autumn of 1952, the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held a work conference on state-owned farms. The farm's leading cadres clarified the idea of "relying on employees to run the farm well" and decided to shift the focus of accounting work to the grassroots, so that the masses would have a clear understanding, in order to improve the farm's operation and management. The headquarters sent a cost accountant to each work area to be responsible for cost accounting work. This decision caused a heated debate among the accounting staff. Some said: "In the past, even the statistical figures could not be 'unified,' this time even the costs are to be calculated at the grassroots level. It's no joke if things get messed up!" Others reflected: "Establishing accounting work in the work area will require six or seven accountants." After repeated mobilization and discussion, it was decided that in the work area, taking the production team as a unit, no additional personnel would be added, and the existing three accounting personnel would form an "accounting group" to work under the direct leadership of the work area director.
    II. The First Step
    After the establishment of the "accounting groups" in the five work areas of the farm, the first step was to conduct discussions and calculations with the production team as a unit to formulate the 1953 production and financial plan. When formulating the plan, people calculated the detailed accounts and knew how much each operation cost. Some work areas automatically proposed to reduce the number of carts, etc., which could be reduced. This item alone can reduce expenditure by 320 million yuan. Through preliminary calculations, the employees recognized that only by keeping detailed accounts can they have a clear understanding and a clear goal when working. The personnel of the "accounting group" also initially realized that accounting work can only play a role when it is linked to the masses.
    In the spring, tractors were sowing wheat on the vast fields. Zhang Jigao, the leader of the "accounting group" in the first work area, was thinking: "If we can calculate the cost of each tractor in time, and let the tractor drivers know whether the cost has been reduced or exceeded, they will improve their work." So he calculated the cost based on each tractor's "operation report form": fuel, labor, depreciation, etc., and calculated until late at night. Through hard work, Zhang Jigao found that fuel, labor, depreciation, etc. were all fixed numbers that had been set according to the planned price. He compiled these fixed numbers into a "conversion table" from one to nine (just add a zero for numbers that reach ten); he also compiled the cost of each operation into a ready-made quota cost "conversion table" from one to nine. With these conversion tables, according to the numbers on the operation report, checking the conversion table, the operating cost of each tractor per day could be calculated in only three or four minutes.
    The accounting group in the first work area announced the operating costs of each locomotive. This was a new thing that had never happened since the establishment of the "September 3rd" Farm. The announcement wrote: "Xu Guangmin's locomotive group reduced operating costs by 2.83 million yuan; Teng Xumo's locomotive group exceeded by 2.52 million yuan." Teng Xumo felt very uncomfortable when he saw that his costs exceeded so much; Ma Chenglin, the production team leader, was also very anxious when he saw that the costs had been exceeded, so he mobilized everyone to study ways to reduce costs. The Teng Xumo group found that the reason for the high cost was: excessive fuel consumption, unclear handover, frequent machine failures, and large waste of time. Based on the problems existing in the group, the Teng Xumo group learned from the experience of the Xu Guangmin group, and later not only recovered the exceeded costs, but also saved 4.29 million yuan in costs.
    However, the experience of the "accounting group" in the first work area was not promoted in the "accounting groups" of other work areas. Some "accounting group" cadres looked down on statistical personnel and refused to learn this experience. These people also said "relying on the masses" on the surface, and followed the tractors in the fields, but in fact they did not see any problems.
    III. Consolidating the Accounting Work
    The spring plowing ended. The cost reports of the "accounting groups" in each work area were not produced. Some work areas also made a mess of the accounting data. Some people said: "Look, the accounts have been messed up, who can take the responsibility for this!" Some people said: "The accounting group is going to collapse." The farm's leading cadres strictly urged the chief accountant and the headquarters cost accountant to personally go to the work area to assist in settling the costs of spring plowing, and only then did they get the reports.
    However, people's confidence in accounting was still not great. In mid-June, the headquarters held a "accounting group" meeting. At the meeting, it criticized some accounting personnel for not fully understanding the important significance of strengthening grassroots accounting, as well as the conservative thinking of not accepting new things and the ideological style of not wanting to go deep into the grassroots, and consolidated the "accounting group" ideologically. The meeting also affirmed the experience of "locomotive cost accounting" in the first work area and decided to uniformly adopt the "conversion table" method throughout the farm, so that each team could publish the operating costs of each tractor in a timely manner.
    At this meeting, the overall cost accounting method was also studied and determined, stipulating that the "accounting group" should not only calculate the complete set of costs, but also supervise the implementation of the production plan, grasp the cost plan, and supervise financial management.
    After the work of the "accounting group" was further developed, the costs of various operations could be announced in a timely manner. However, each crop and each operation had to be calculated in order, such as wheat being calculated one by one according to tilling, harrowing, and sowing, and each other crop also had to be calculated in this way, and also had to be calculated once according to "planned price" and "actual price," and a comparison of various differences had to be made. In this way, each period's cost reports would have dozens of sheets. This complex accounting method became a burden on the work of the "accounting group" at that time. At this time, a work group from the Bookkeeping and Accounting Teaching and Research Section of the Renmin University of China came to study the accounting issues of state-owned farms. Based on the Soviet experience, they suggested adopting the method of jointly accounting for the cost of each item of work, which simplified the accounting work several times. Later, from the factors affecting the cost, the purpose and method of grassroots accounting were clarified, so that everyone clearly recognized that there are two factors that affect the cost: one is the internal efficiency factor, that is, if the labor efficiency is improved and the raw material consumption is reduced, the cost will be reduced; the other is the external price factor, that is, if the raw material price is high, the cost will be high. The main task of grassroots accounting is to explore internal factors, and through accounting, to promote the vast number of employees to improve efficiency and reduce consumption, in order to reduce costs. As for the external price factors, the employees have no power to change it, and there is no need for detailed accounting at the grassroots level. In the autumn, they also learned from the experience of the "May 3rd" Factory in accounting reform, further simplified the calculation method, and found a relatively advanced method for accounting work. It was universally used throughout the farm in 1954, and the employees had a clear understanding and automatically paid attention to saving costs in production.
    IV. "Big Beard Captain"
    The experience of establishing grassroots accounting work in the farm proves that the cost of production units that pay attention to accounting has been significantly reduced. Since the accounting work is carried out on a production team basis, unlike the unified calculation and average apportionment throughout the farm in the past, the advanced and backward production teams are also clearly reflected.
    Zhang Shukuai, the captain of the fourth production team, was nicknamed "Big Beard Captain." After being promoted from tractor driver to captain, he still drove a tractor to work, and was not afraid of wind or rain, but was afraid of accounting. He only managed production and did not ask about costs. In 1953, the yield of wheat per hectare in this production team reached 1,087 kilograms (the average for the whole farm was only 740 kilograms), but the cost was 25% higher than the total average for the whole farm. As a result, it was still unprofitable. When the "accounting group" announced the costs, each production team was discussing and studying ways to reduce costs. Zhang Shukuai pushed the form to the table and said: "Statistician, the machine is always breaking down, I have to go to the ground. You look at it, what kind of accounting is this?" The statistician didn't pay attention and filled out the form casually and handed it in.
    When summarizing the work in winter, Zhang Shukuai always thought that his team had high yields and achieved great results. The comrades of the "accounting group" said: "Captain Zhang, your costs are too high, more than 2.5 million per hectare of wheat, and you lost 20 to 30 million!"
    "After a year of hard work, we produce so much grain, and you say we lost money, this won't do!"
      "We can calculate the accounts."
    The accounts were calculated: the wheat seeds were not prepared well, and the germination rate was only 65%, so 65 kilograms of seeds were sown per hectare; there were many machine failures and low efficiency, with 300,000 yuan spent per hectare on repair costs and 210,000 yuan spent on depreciation; fuel consumption exceeded the quota by 22%; the autumn plowing machine could not complete the task, so "reinforcements" were transferred from other production teams, spending 3 to 4 million yuan on transfer and transportation fees... As he calculated, beads of sweat appeared on Zhang Shukuai's forehead.
    "Captain Zhang, you lost money this year, and it's going to be difficult next year. It costs less than 400,000 yuan per hectare for autumn plowing, but you spent 760,000 yuan! This will be calculated into next year's cost." Zhang Shukuai stroked his big beard, stared at his eyes, and said nothing.
    At the work summary meeting, the farm's general branch secretary of the Party conducted education for all employees with this actual example.
    V. "This is Muddled Accounting"
    Through the actual work of one year in 1953 and the lessons of the fourth production team, at the beginning of 1954, a trend of keeping detailed accounts emerged throughout the farm. The mass accounting ideology was established, and the cost was greatly reduced.
    In 1954, the fourth production team changed two new captains. These two production team captains learned from Zhang Shukuai's lessons, and had to calculate the detailed accounts first before they dared to do anything. The farm decided to apply superphosphate fertilizer to the wheat land, and allocated three tons to the fourth production team. That night, the two captains started calculating the accounts again. One jin of superphosphate costs more than 2,000 yuan, and the cost per hectare would increase by more than 200,000 yuan. How much more grain can it produce? No one had any experience. Should we use none at all? We are afraid of being criticized. Should we use all of it? We really can't bear to spend so much money. In the end, they decided to keep one ton and return two tons. This team had more than 20 hectares that had not been plowed in the autumn, and the captain thought again: if we don't plow the land this spring, we can just harrow it once, which can save more than 100,000 yuan per hectare. Someone said: "I think we lost money because there were too many operation procedures. The land that has not been plowed can still produce grain." Later, this piece of land was not plowed, but just harrowed and planted with wheat.
    During the year's production process, the fourth production team calculated detailed accounts everywhere. A year of calculating detailed accounts was not in vain. After calculating the total accounts in the autumn, the cost was reduced by more than 30% compared with the previous year, and the planned profit of 150 million yuan was completed by more than 300 million. The captain happily said: "If we didn't keep detailed accounts, how could we have achieved this!"
    After the harvest was completed, the average yield of wheat per hectare in the fourth production team was 1,974 kilograms. What a good harvest! However, in this good harvest, the yield was so unbalanced. The wheat that was applied with superphosphate had a yield of 2,300 kilograms per hectare, which was 26.8% higher than the land in the same area and with the same variety that was not applied with superphosphate. The two captains regretted it so much that they stamped their feet when they thought of the two tons of superphosphate they had returned. The wheat planted on the land that was not plowed had a yield of only 1,400 kilograms per hectare. They miscalculated these two accounts and produced more than 29,000 kilograms less wheat. Captain Wang Demin slapped his head and shouted: "What kind of cost accounting is this? This is muddled accounting!"
    VI. A New Atmosphere Emerged
    In 1954, based on the development of grassroots accounting work and a year's experience, the farm's leading cadres decided to implement operation plans and bonus incentives, and further carried out quota accounting for locomotives, which greatly improved work efficiency. Taking spring plowing operations as an example, among the 45 tractors operating throughout the farm, 31 reduced costs. In the process of sowing wheat alone, the farm reduced direct costs by 757 million yuan, and shortened the wheat sowing period by ten days compared with previous years.
    During spring plowing operations, the "accounting group" of the first work area created a method of "quota accounting" for large carts. After this accounting method was rolled out throughout the farm, most of the work that was originally undertaken by two large carts was reduced to one large cart, and the other large cart was drawn out to transport materials to the basic construction department. Lu Sheng, a large cart transporter in the third production team, completed the task of two large carts with one large cart, and also reduced costs by 760,000 yuan in one month.
    Tractor drivers also tried their best to protect locomotives, use waste products, and reduce the consumption of parts. When a copper sleeve on tractor driver Xu Guangmin's locomotive broke, he asked at the warehouse and found that one was worth 30,000 yuan. He left silently and went back to repair an old one to use. When a combine operator, Tong Qingshan's machine broke a exhaust pipe gasket, a new one cost 70,000 yuan. He found a way to patch it up with an old one, and it could still be used.
    During wheat harvesting operations, a "quota accounting" method for automobiles was drafted in imitation of the "quota accounting" method for large carts. The more than 7,000 hectares of wheat on the farm only used 26 automobiles, which not only completed the field transportation tasks, but also delivered 4,500 tons of wheat to the station and handed it over to the state. The 8,500 tons of wheat that the farm handed over to the state were all delivered by the end of September. In 1952, only more than 5,000 hectares of wheat were planted. In addition to dispatching its own 26 automobiles and ten Ford tractors, it also hired twelve automobiles. The wheat handed over to the state was not completely transported until March of the following year.
    Due to the widespread detailed accounting throughout the farm, the chaotic phenomenon of property management was also eliminated. Even a small part was accounted for in accordance with the goods. Various assets are managed in an orderly manner.
    In this way, the cost was greatly reduced. Looking at the main crops, compared with 1952, which had the same natural conditions, the unit area cost of wheat was reduced by 12%, and the unit area cost of soybeans was reduced by 29%. Due to the reduction of costs and the increase of yields, the farm obtained a profit of 464.9 million yuan in 1954, reversing the situation of unprofitable operations in recent years.

    “要不算细账，哪来这成绩”
    ——国营“九三”农场扭转经营无利局面的经验
    丁履枢
    一、问题在哪里
    国营“九三”机械农场位于黑龙江的嫩江草原上，耕地有一万四千多公顷，是我国现有国营农场中最大的一个。这个农场建立已近五年，每年都缴给国家成千上万吨的粮食。但在一九五三年以前，这个农场却年年赔钱。农场的职工们说：打这么多粮食还赔钱？真是赔的稀里糊涂！有些职工明知经营管理上有问题，但谁也不知从哪里下手解决。
    这个农场设有比较健全的财务会计部门，可是经济核算工作却只是在场部孤立地进行。每种作业需要多少费用？各种作物要用多少成本？不但直接生产的工人不了解，就是领导干部也不清楚。人们只知道生产，不知道怎样才能作到生产有利。场内工作人员存在着供给制思想，不论什么物资财产，用的时候伸手要，不用就推到仓库里。在一九五三年年初清产核资时，单是积压的物资就值六十八亿元。这样就造成浪费大、成本高、增产赔钱的严重现象。
    一九五二年秋天，中共中央东北局召开国营农场工作会议，农场领导干部明确了“依靠职工办好农场”的思想，决定把核算工作的重点放到基层去，使群众心中有数，以改进农场的经营管理。场部派到每个作业区成本会计一名，负责进行成本核算工作。这一决定在会计工作人员中引起了激烈的争论。有的说：“过去连统计数字都‘统’不上来，这回连成本都叫下边算，搞乱了可不是玩的！”也有人反映：“在作业区建立核算工作，要用上六、七个会计员才能行。”经过反复动员和讨论研究，确定了在作业区以生产队为单位，不另增加人，由现有的三个核算人员成立“核算组”，在作业区主任的直接领导下进行工作。
    二、第一步工作
    全场五个作业区的“核算组”建立起来之后，第一步工作就是以生产队为单位进行讨论、核算，制订一九五三年度生产财务计划。人们在制订计划时算了细账，知道了每项作业的成本是多少。有些作业区就自动提出减少可以缩减的大车等等。只这一项就可减少开支三亿二千万元。通过初步计算，职工群众认识了只有算细账，心里才有底，干起活来才有目标。“核算组”的人员也初步认识到核算工作只有联系了群众，才能发挥作用。
    春天，一望无际的田野上，拖拉机在播种小麦。第一作业区“核算组”组长张季高在想：“如果能及时把每台拖拉机的成本算出来，叫拖拉机手们知道成本降低了或是超过了，他们就会去改进自己的工作。”于是他就根据每台拖拉机的“作业报告单”计算成本：油料、人工、折旧费等等，一算就算到深更半夜。在辛勤的劳动中，张季高发现油料、人工、折旧费等都是早已按计划价格定下来的一些固定数。他把这些固定数编成了从一到九的“换算表”（到了十的数加上一个零就行了）；又把每种作业的成本编成从一到九的现成的定额成本“换算表”。有了这几种换算表，根据作业报告单上的数字核对换算表，只用三、四分钟，每台拖拉机一天的作业成本就算出来了。
    第一作业区的核算组把每台机车的作业成本公布了。这是“九三”农场建场以来第一次出现的新事情。公布的项目里写着：徐广民机车组降低了作业成本二百八十三万元；滕叙模机车组超过了二百五十二万元。滕叙模看到自己超过的成本这么多，心里很难受；生产队长马成林看到超过了成本，也很着急，就发动大家研究降低成本的办法。滕叙模组发现成本高的原因是：油料消耗多，交班不明确，机器故障多，时间浪费大。滕叙模组根据本组存在的问题，学习了徐广民组的经验，后来不但把超过的成本找回来了，而且还节约了成本四百二十九万元。
    但是，第一作业区“核算组”的经验，并没有在其他作业区的“核算组”推广。有些“核算组”的干部瞧不起统计人员，不肯学习这种经验。这些人表面上也说“依靠群众”，下地跟在拖拉机后面跑，实际啥问题也没看出来。
    三、把核算工作巩固下来
    春耕结束了。各作业区“核算组”的成本表报都没作出来。有的作业区把核算的资料也搞得乱七八糟。有人说：“看吧，把账搞垮了，谁能负起这责任！”有人说：“核算组要垮了。”农场的领导干部严格督促会计主任和场部成本会计亲自到作业区去，协助结算春耕的成本，这才把表报拿上来。
    但是人们对核算的信心仍然不大。六月中旬，场部召开了“核算组”会议，会上批判了部分核算人员对加强基层核算的重要意义认识不足，以及不接受新事物的保守思想和不愿深入基层的思想作风，从思想上把“核算组”巩固下来。会议又肯定了第一作业区的“机车成本核算”的经验，决定全场一致采用“换算表”的方法，使各队都能把每台拖拉机的作业成本及时公布出去。
    在这次会议上，又研究确定了全盘的成本核算方法，规定“核算组”除计算全套成本外，还要监督生产计划的执行，掌握成本计划，监督财务管理等。
    “核算组”的工作进一步展开之后，各种作业的成本都能及时公布了。但是每种作物、每个作业都要顺序核算，如小麦按耕地、耙地、播种等一一计算，其他每一种作物也得这么算，并且还要按“计划价格”、“实际价格”一样算一遍，作出各项差异的比较，这样，每期的成本表报就有好几十张。这样复杂的核算方法，成为“核算组”在当时工作上的一种负担。这时恰好中国人民大学簿记核算教研室派来了一个工作组，研究国营农场的会计核算问题。他们根据苏联的经验，建议采取按每项工作共同核算成本的方法，使核算工作简化了好几倍。后来又从影响成本高低的因素上，明确了基层核算的目的和方法，使大家明确认识影响成本高低有两个因素：一个是内在的效率因素，劳动效率提高，原材料消耗减少，成本就会降低；另一个是外在的价格因素，原材料价格高了，成本就会高。基层核算的主要任务就是发掘内在因素，通过核算，促使广大的职工提高效率，减少消耗，以降低成本。至于外在的价格因素，职工们没有力量改变它，基层就没有详细核算的必要。秋天，又学习了“五三”工厂在会计核算改革方面的经验，进一步简化了计算方法，找到了核算工作上比较先进的办法。一九五四年全场普遍使用，职工心中有数，在生产中自动注意节约成本。
    四、“大胡子队长”
    农场建立基层核算工作的经验证明，凡是注意算账的生产单位，成本很明显地降低下来了。由于核算工作是按生产队为单位进行的，不像过去那样全场统一计算，平均分摊，因此，先进和落后的生产队也很明显的表现出来了。
    第四生产队队长张树奎，外号叫“大胡子队长”。他由拖拉机手被提拔为队长后，还是开上拖拉机去干活，风里雨里都不怕，就是怕算账。他是只管生产，不问成本。一九五三年这个生产队小麦每公顷产量达到一千零八十七公斤（全场平均才只七百四十公斤），成本却比全场总平均数高出了百分之二十五。结果还是经营无利。“核算组”公布成本了，各生产队都在讨论研究降低成本的办法。张树奎把表格往桌上一推，说：“统计员，机器老出毛病，我得下地啦。你看看吧，又是啥核算？”统计员也不注意，随便填了表交上去了。
    冬天总结工作时，张树奎总认为自己队产量高，成绩不小。“核算组”的同志说：“张队长，你们的成本太高啦，小麦每垧二百五十多万，算下来还赔了两三千万！”
    “辛辛苦苦一年，打这么多粮食，说俺们赔钱，这不行！”
      “咱可以算账啊。”
    账算起来了：小麦种籽没弄好，发芽率才百分之六十五，每公顷多播种籽六十五公斤；机车故障多，效率低，每公顷开支修理费三十万元，支出折旧费二十一万元；油料消耗超过定额百分之二十二；秋耕地机器完不成任务，向别的生产队调“援兵”，开支调车运费三、四百万……，算着算着，张树奎的头上冒出了汗珠儿。
    “张队长，今年赔啦，明年还够呛。人家一垧秋翻地不到四十万，你们七十六万呀！这要算到明年的成本上。”张树奎摸弄着自己的大胡子，瞪着眼睛不作声了。
    在总结工作的大会上，农场党的总支书记以这个实际例子向全体职工们进行了教育。
    五、“这样算是糊涂账”
    通过一九五三年一年的实际工作和第四生产队的教训，一九五四年一开始，全场出现了算细账的风气。群众性的核算思想树立起来了，成本大大降低了。
    一九五四年第四生产队换了两个新队长。这两个生产队长记取了张树奎的教训，无论什么事情，总得先算细账，然后才敢干。农场决定在小麦地上施用过磷酸钙肥料，给第四生产队拨来了三吨。这天晚上，两个队长又算起账来了，一斤过磷酸钙两千多元，一公顷地增加成本二十多万，能多打多少粮食呢？谁也没经验。一点不用吧？怕挨批评。全用吧？实在舍不得这么一大笔钱。最后他们确定留下一吨，退回两吨。这个队有二十多公顷没有秋耕，队长又想：要是今春不耕地，光用耙耙一遍也行，一公顷能省十好几万。有人说：“我看咱们赔钱就赔在作业程序太多啦，没翻过的地，也是一样打粮食。”后来这块地没有耕，只是耙了耙就种上小麦了。
    一年的生产过程中，第四生产队处处算细账。算了一年细账没白费，秋后算总账，成本比上年降低了百分之三十多，一亿五千万元的计划利润，完成了三亿多。队长高兴地说：“要不算细账，哪来这成绩！”
    收获完了，第四生产队小麦平均每公顷产量一千九百七十四公斤，好收成啊！可是在这好的收成中，产量是这样的不平衡，施上过磷酸钙的小麦，每公顷产量达到了二千三百公斤，和同一地段、同一品种没施过磷酸钙的地对比，提高了产量百分之二十六点八。两个队长想起退回去的那两吨过磷酸钙，后悔的直跺脚。没有耕地种上的那小麦，每公顷产量只一千四百多公斤。算错了这两笔账，少打了两万九千多公斤小麦。队长王德敏拍打着脑袋直嚷嚷：“这是啥的成本核算？这是算的糊涂账！”
    六、出现了新的气象
    一九五四年，农场领导干部根据基层核算工作的发展和一年的体验，又决定实行作业计划和超额奖励，进一步开展了机车的定额核算，使工作效率大为提高。仅以春耕作业为例，全场有四十五台拖拉机作业，其中三十一台降低了成本，仅在播种小麦过程中，全场就降低了直接成本七亿五千七百万元，同时使小麦播种期较往年缩短了十天。
    春耕作业中，第一作业区的“核算组”又创造了大车“定额核算”的办法。这种核算在全场展开之后，原先两台大车所担负的工作，大部分减为一台大车去作了，另一台大车抽出去给基本建设部门运材料。第三生产队大车运输员吕生一台大车完成了两台大车的任务，而且在一个月里还降低了成本七十六万元。
    拖拉机手们也尽量爱护机车，利用废品，减少零件消耗。拖拉机手徐广民的机车坏了一个铜套，他到仓库一问，一个价值三万元，他一声不响的走了，自己回去修上一个旧的用。康拜因手佟庆山的机器坏了一个排气管垫，新的要七万元，他想办法用旧的补上了，一样能用。
    麦收作业中，又仿照大车“定额核算”的办法拟订了汽车的“定额核算”办法，全场七千多公顷小麦，只用二十六台汽车，不但完成了田间运输任务，而且还把四千五百吨小麦送到车站，缴给了国家。全场缴给国家的八千五百吨小麦，在九月末就送完了。一九五二年才种了五千多公顷小麦，除了出动了自己的二十六台汽车和十台福特拖拉机以外，又雇了十二台汽车，缴给国家的小麦，一直运到第二年三月才运完。
    由于在全场范围内展开了算细账，财产管理的混乱现象也消灭了。就是连一个小小的零件，也都作到了账物相符。各种资产管理得井井有条。
    这样一来成本大大地降低了。从主要作物来看，和自然条件相同的一九五二年比较，单位面积成本小麦降低了百分之十二，大豆降低了百分之二十九；由于降低了成本，又提高了产量，一九五四年农场获得利润四十六亿四千九百多万元，扭转了几年来经营无利的局面。
