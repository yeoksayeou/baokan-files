    [This newspaper report] China's electric power industry's basic construction scale is huge this year. Throughout the year, more than 100 new, renovated, and restored power generation and transmission projects will be undertaken. Among them are large-scale power projects aided by the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries, as well as construction and installation projects using domestically produced turbine generators, and renovation projects for old and outdated equipment. The total installed capacity of thermal power equipment put into production this year will be 98 percent more than last year, and the total installed capacity of hydropower equipment will be 25.5 percent more than last year. In order to meet the needs of national industrial construction, this year will also continue to conduct site surveys and design work for thermal power plants, with a much larger workload than last year. In addition, surveys of eight rivers, including the Yellow River, and design work for major projects will be carried out to provide a reliable foundation for the construction of hydroelectric power stations.
    According to the requirements of the national plan, the Northeast region will build and renovate thermal power plants, heating power plants, and hydroelectric power stations in Jilin, Fushun, Fuxin, and Fengman. The North China and East China regions will continue to build and renovate heating power plants such as in Taiyuan, and thermal power plants in places like Shanghai, as well as the Guanting Hydroelectric Power Station. The Northwest, Central South, and Southwest regions will build new and continue to renovate thermal power plants such as in Xi'an, and other hydroelectric power stations. In addition to many projects that can be put into production in the next year or two, nearly thirty thermal power plants and hydroelectric power stations will be put into operation this year in succession. This newly generated, powerful electricity will supply the urgent needs of heavy industry, transportation, and light industry factories and mines throughout the country.
    In order to ensure that the electricity from thermal power plants and hydroelectric power stations put into production is promptly transmitted to factories and mines, ten 110,000-volt high-voltage transmission lines will be built across the country this year. The Taiyang transmission line, over 100 kilometers long with a voltage of 110,000 volts, will begin transmitting electricity in the fourth quarter after intensive construction. In this way, the electricity from the Taiyuan Heating Power Plant will not only supply power to Taiyuan, but also be sent to the Yangquan Coal Mine, ensuring the production and construction needs of the coal mining industry.
    In order to ensure the completion of these large-scale power construction projects, the Central Fuel Industry Ministry has initially determined that this year's investment in thermal power generation will increase by 55 percent compared to last year, investment in hydropower generation will increase by 67 percent compared to last year, the construction and installation workload of thermal power will increase by 47 percent compared to last year, and the construction and installation workload of hydropower will increase by 139 percent compared to last year.

    我国电业基本建设规模巨大
    今年新建改建电力工程百多项
    【本报讯】今年我国电力工业基本建设规模巨大。全年将新建、改建、恢复发电和送变电工程一百多项，其中有苏联和各人民民主国家帮助我国建设的规模巨大的电力工程，也有我国自制透平发电机的建筑安装工程，和残旧设备的改建工程。全年投入生产的火力发电设备能力将比去年多百分之九十八，水力发电设备能力将比去年多百分之二十五点五。为了适应国家工业建设的需要，今年还要继续进行火电厂的厂址勘测和设计工作，工作量比去年增加很多。此外，并将进行对黄河等八条河流的勘测和重大工程的设计工作，为水电站的建设提供可靠基础。
    按照国家计划要求，东北地区将新建和改建吉林、抚顺、阜新、丰满等火电厂、热电厂和水电站，华北、华东地区将继续新建和改建太原等热电厂和上海等地的火电厂以及官厅水电站。西北、中南和西南地区将新建和继续改建西安等火电厂和其他水电站。除不少工程可在明后年投入生产外，今年将有近三十处的火电厂和水电站相继发电。这些新生的强大电力将供应全国各地重工业、交通运输业和轻工业等厂矿企业的迫切需要。
    为了保证投入生产的火电厂和水电站的电力及时输送到工厂和矿山，今年全国将建设十条十一万伏电压的高压输电线路。长达一百多公里、十一万伏电压的太阳输电线路，经紧张施工后，将于第四季开始送电，这样太原热电厂的电力不但供应了太原用电，而且可以送向阳泉煤矿，保证煤矿工业的生产建设需要。
    中央燃料工业部为了保证完成这些规模宏大的电力建设工程，初步确定今年火力发电投资将比去年增加百分之五十五，水力发电投资将比去年增加百分之六十七，火电的建筑安装工作量将比去年增加百分之四十七，水电的建筑安装工作量将比去年增加百分之一百三十九。
