Xinhua News Agency, January 18th: TASS, Warsaw, January 17th: Polish newspapers widely comment on the TASS statement regarding the Soviet government's readiness to provide scientific and technological experience in the peaceful uses of atomic energy.

	"People's Tribune," in an editorial titled "For Humanity, For Life," points out the enormous significance of the construction of the first atomic power station in the Soviet Union. The newspaper points out that this is the first time in human history that atomic energy has been used for construction and life, rather than for manufacturing destruction and death.

	The North Atlantic Group Council meeting held last December formally announced that the contracting parties to the North Atlantic Treaty would consider their military plans based on the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

	Faced with these plans, the Soviet Union's willingness to provide other countries, including the United States, Britain, and France, with its experience in the peaceful uses of atomic energy powerfully demonstrates the Soviet Union's strength, its composure, and its trust in the conscience and reason of all peoples.

	The newspaper concludes by saying that the Polish public warmly welcomes the new initiative of our ally, friend, and brother—the great and powerful Soviet Union.
Xinhua News Agency, January 18th: TASS, Prague, January 17th: The TASS statement regarding the Soviet government's readiness to make public the scientific and technical experience of the first atomic power station has become the focus of attention for Czechoslovak newspapers.

	"Red Right" writes that the Soviet government's proposal is particularly important because it is being put forward at a time when the international situation is once again becoming tense and the imperialist camp, following the North Atlantic Group's decision to prepare for atomic war, is already openly attempting to use atomic weapons. The newspaper points out that the Soviet Union has put forward many proposals on banning atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, and that the Soviet Union has consistently pursued one idea and one desire: to use atomic energy for peaceful purposes.

	An editorial in "Free Talk" says that the Soviet Union is willing to make public its scientific and technical experience in the use of atomic energy. Although the Soviet Union possesses atomic and hydrogen bombs, it firmly advocates a complete and unconditional ban on all weapons that massively slaughter humanity. "Free Talk" points out that peace-loving people have the power to achieve the goal of completely banning atomic weapons and using the achievements of nuclear physics to benefit humanity.
Xinhua News Agency, January 18th: According to the Romanian News Agency, Bucharest, January 17th: The news that the Soviet Union is providing other countries with scientific, technical, and industrial assistance in promoting research into the peaceful uses of atomic energy has aroused particular interest in Romania.

	Romanian radio stations repeatedly broadcast this news today, which has caused a strong reaction among scientists, engineers, doctors, and throughout Romanian public opinion. It is believed that the Soviet government's decision to allow the People's Republic of Romania and other countries to understand the atomic research work carried out by the Soviet Union in the peaceful uses of atomic energy once again proves that the Soviet Union is willing to effectively help the people of other countries use atomic energy to serve humanity and the cause of progress.
Xinhua News Agency, January 18th: TASS, Budapest, January 17th: The Hungarian "Free People's Newspaper" published an editorial on the Soviet government's publication of the working experience of the Soviet atomic power station. The editorial said that in the summer of 1954, the Soviet Union demonstrated by example that the liberated atomic energy can be controlled within a certain range and used for the peaceful development of mankind. The Soviet Union said, please follow our example. Atomic energy can become a very great energy that benefits mankind. We can now use it. Let it become the property of all mankind.
Xinhua News Agency, January 18th: According to TASS, Tirana, January 17th: The Albanian "Unity Newspaper" commented on the TASS statement regarding the Soviet government's readiness to make public the scientific and technical experience of the Soviet Union's first atomic energy industrial power station, writing: This once again proves the Soviet Union's unremitting commitment to using atomic energy solely for peaceful purposes, for the benefit of humanity, and for the progress of humanity. Our people, who are faithful to the cause of consolidating peace, welcome the Soviet Union's new peace proposal with great satisfaction.
Xinhua News Agency, January 18th: According to TASS, Delhi, January 17th: Some Indian newspapers commented on the Soviet Union's statement regarding its readiness to make public the scientific and technical experience of the atomic power station.

	"The Hindu" believes that this news is very noteworthy. The newspaper also hopes that the international conference discussing the peaceful use of atomic energy will seriously consider the Soviet proposal and discuss the possibility of cooperation between East and West for the peaceful use of atomic energy.

	"Indian Express," in an editorial titled "Friendly Gesture," welcomes this timely and concrete step by the Soviet Union. The newspaper says: "Using atomic energy to generate electricity is one aspect of the Soviet Union's significant achievements, and exchanging information in this area through specialized organizations will increase the results of research work in various countries."
Xinhua News Agency, January 18th: TASS, The Hague, January 17th: The Soviet Union's statement regarding the presentation of a report on atomic power stations has aroused great attention in the Dutch newspapers. Many newspapers published this news in a prominent position with large headlines. "The Hague News" wrote: Exchanging information on the peaceful use of atomic energy can promote the easing of international tensions.
Xinhua News Agency, January 18th: TASS, Copenhagen, January 17th: The Danish "Land and People's Newspaper" commented on the Soviet government's decision to provide other countries with a report on the world's first atomic power station.

	The newspaper points out that the United States uses atomic energy production to intimidate the people of the world or to force them to accept the American way of life. The newspaper then says that the Soviet Union, which has consistently fought for peace and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction, has made every effort to develop atomic energy production for peaceful purposes and has built the world's first atomic power station. Now, the Soviet Union is offering its knowledge to the world, which is a new and giant step forward on the road to peaceful development throughout the world.

    波、捷、罗、匈、阿、印、荷、丹等国舆论
    欢迎苏联提供原子能和平用途方面的经验
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社华沙十七日讯：波兰报纸广泛评论塔斯社关于苏联政府准备提供原子能和平用途方面的科学技术经验的声明。
      “人民论坛报”在以“为了人类，为了生活”为题的社论中指出苏联第一个原子能电力站建成的巨大意义。报纸指出，这是人类历史上第一次把原子能用在建设和生活方面，而不是用来制造毁灭和死亡。
    去年十二月举行的北大西洋集团理事会会议正式宣布，北大西洋公约缔约国将依据使用原子武器和氢武器来考虑自己的军事计划。
    面对着这些计划，苏联准备把苏联在原子能和平用途方面的经验提供给其他国家，其中包括美国、英国和法国，这就有力地证明了苏联的强大，苏联的镇定，苏联对各国人民的良知和理性的信任。
    报纸最后说，波兰公众热烈欢迎我们的盟国、朋友和兄弟——伟大的和强大的苏联的新的创议。
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社布拉格十七日讯：塔斯社关于苏联政府准备公开第一个原子能电力站的科学及技术经验的声明，成为捷克斯洛伐克报纸注意的中心。
      “红色权利报”写道，苏联政府的建议所以显得特别重要，是因为它是在国际局势再度紧张起来、帝国主义阵营在北大西洋集团决定准备原子战争以后已经在公开企图使用原子武器的时候提出来的。报纸指出，苏联已经提出了许多关于禁止原子武器、氢武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器的建议，苏联始终贯彻着一个思想和一个愿望：将原子能用于和平目的。
    “自由谈报”的社论说，苏联愿意把利用原子能的科学及技术经验公开。苏联虽然拥有原子弹和氢弹，但是它坚决主张彻底和无条件地禁止一切大规模屠杀人类的武器。“自由谈报”指出，爱好和平的人民是有力量达到彻底禁止原子武器、将核子物理学的成就用来造福人类的目标的。
   【新华社十八日讯】据罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特十七日讯：苏联在促进原子能和平用途的研究方面给予其他国家以科学、技术和工业上的帮助的消息，在罗马尼亚引起了特别的兴趣。
    罗马尼亚各广播电台今天一再播送了这个消息，它在科学家，工程师，医生中间以及在罗马尼亚整个舆论界引起了很强烈的反响。人们认为，苏联政府允许罗马尼亚人民共和国和其他国家了解苏联在原子能和平用途方面进行的原子研究工作的决定再一次证明：苏联愿意有效地帮助其他国家人民把原子能用来为人类、为进步事业服务。
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社布达佩斯十七日讯：匈牙利“自由人民报”就苏联政府公开苏联原子能电力站工作经验发表社论。社论说，一九五四年夏天，苏联以实例表明，可以把解放出来的原子能控制在一定的范围内，使它为人类的和平发展服务。苏联说，请你们仿效我们的先例。原子能可以成为给人类造福的极其伟大的能。我们现在能够利用它。让它成为全人类的财产吧。
   【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社地拉那十七日讯：阿尔巴尼亚“团结报”评论塔斯社关于苏联政府准备公开苏联第一个原子能工业电力站的科学、技术经验的声明时写道：这又一次证明了苏联坚持不懈地致力于把原子能只用于和平目的，以为人类造福，使人类进步。忠实于巩固和平事业的我国人民，非常满意地欢迎苏联新的和平建议。
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社德里十七日讯：一些印度报纸评论苏联关于准备公开原子能电力站的科学技术经验的声明。
    “印度教徒报”认为这个消息是十分值得注意的。这个报纸还希望讨论和平利用原子能的国际会议认真地对待苏联的建议，并且讨论东西方为和平利用原子能而进行合作的可能性。
      “印度快报”在题为“友好的姿态”的社论中表示，欢迎苏联这个适时而且具体的步骤。报纸说：“利用原子能来发电是苏联获得重大成就的一个方面，通过专门的组织来交换这方面的情报，将会使各国研究工作的成果增大。”
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社海牙十七日讯：苏联准备提出关于原子能电力站的报告的声明，引起荷兰报纸很大的注意。许多报纸在显著地位用大字标题刊登了这个消息。“海牙新闻”写道：在和平利用原子能方面交换资料，可以促进国际紧张局势的缓和。
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社哥本哈根十七日讯：丹麦“国土与人民报”评论苏联政府准备向其他国家提供世界上第一个原子能发电站的报告的决定。
    这个报纸指出，美国利用原子能生产来恐吓世界各国人民，或是来强迫他们接受美国生活方式。报纸接着说，始终不渝地为和平和禁止大规模毁灭性武器而斗争的苏联，竭尽全力地为和平目的而发展原子能生产，并且建筑了世界上第一个原子能发电站。现在，苏联向全世界提出自己的知识，这在全世界和平发展的道路上，向前迈进了新的、巨大的一步。
