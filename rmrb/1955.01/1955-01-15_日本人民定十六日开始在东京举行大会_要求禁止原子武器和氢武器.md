Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, January 12th: The Secretariat of the World Peace Council announced that the Japanese people will begin a conference in Tokyo on January 16th, demanding a ban on atomic and hydrogen weapons. This conference will discuss the proposal to hold an international gathering against atomic and hydrogen weapons in Hiroshima on August 6th this year.

    As the conference is about to be held, the Secretariat of the World Peace Council published a statement to the press by Taneura Takashi, member of the Standing Committee of the Japan Peace Preservation Committee.

    The statement pointed out that as of December 20, 1954, more than 20 million signatures demanding the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons had been collected in Japan.

    The statement said that the Japanese people have expressed their opposition to the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons in various forms. Political parties, trade unions, religious groups, lawyers' organizations, scientific organizations, writers' organizations, women's organizations, and youth organizations have all expressed this protest.

    Both houses of the Japanese Diet, forty-six prefectures, and more than two hundred and fifty city and village assemblies have also passed resolutions demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons.

    People from all walks of life have participated in this movement. The National Council of the Signature Campaign for the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs in Japan is composed of representatives from all walks of life. For example, participants in this council include former Prime Minister Tetsu Katayama and Nobel Prize winner Hideki Yukawa. Signature collection committees have been organized in each prefecture and city, and these committees include prefectural governors, mayors, members of local governments, trade union representatives, representatives of women's organizations, youth organizations, and other organizations.

    The statement said: Regardless of the fact that the protest movement in Japan has truly reached a national scale, atomic bombs have not only not been banned, but, furthermore, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council has decided to use atomic bombs in war. We believe that if the world public unites and acts together, it will certainly be able to achieve the goal of banning atomic and hydrogen weapons.

    The statement concluded: The conference demanding the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons will give the Japanese people greater strength to achieve this goal.

    日本人民定十六日开始在东京举行大会
    要求禁止原子武器和氢武器
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社维也纳十二日讯：世界和平理事会书记处宣布，日本人民将于一月十六日在东京开始举行要求禁止原子武器和氢武器大会。这个大会将讨论今年八月六日在广岛举行反对原子武器和氢武器的国际性集会的建议。
    由于会议即将召开，世界和平理事会书记处向报界发表了日本拥护和平委员会常务委员会委员种村孝的声明。
    声明指出，到一九五四年十二月二十日为止，在日本已经征集了两千多万个要求禁止原子武器和氢武器的签名。
    声明说，日本人民以各种各样的形式表示了他们反对试验原子武器和氢武器的意见。表示这种抗议的有政党、工会、宗教团体、律师组织、科学家组织、作家组织、妇女组织和青年组织等。
    日本国会两院，四十六个都、道、府、县，二百五十多个城市和乡村的议会也都通过了要求禁止原子武器的决议。
    各阶层居民都参加了这个运动。日本禁止原子弹和氢弹签名运动全国协议会是由社会各阶层的代表组成的。譬如，参加这个协议会的有：前首相片山哲、诺贝尔奖金得奖人汤川秀树等人。在各县和市中组织了征集签名委员会，参加这些委员会的有县知事、市长、地方自治机关的委员、工会代表、妇女组织、青年组织和其他组织的代表。
    声明说：不顾在日本的抗议运动真正具有了全国规模，原子弹不仅没有被禁止，而且，更进一步，北大西洋集团理事会已决定在战争中使用原子弹。我们相信，世界公众如果团结一致地行动起来，就一定能够达到禁止原子武器和氢武器的目的。
    声明最后说：要求禁止原子武器和氢武器大会将使日本人民有更大的力量去达到这个目的。
