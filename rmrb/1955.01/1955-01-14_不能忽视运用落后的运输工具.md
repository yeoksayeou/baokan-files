We Must Not Neglect the Use of Backward Means of Transportation
Sun Weihe, Deputy Director of the Henan Provincial Department of Transportation

With the rapid development of national economic construction, the task of material exchange is becoming increasingly heavy, and Henan Province's transportation industry has clearly fallen behind the needs of the objective situation. The current situation is: too much cargo, too few cars, and bad roads. Taking the Xu (chang) - Nan (yang) area as an example, the monthly transportation task is a total of 22,613 tons, while the existing cars and horse-drawn carts on the Xu-Nan line can only complete 14,704 tons of transportation tasks. Due to insufficient transportation capacity, tasks cannot be completed in a timely manner, which has caused stockpiling of materials in some areas and production stoppages awaiting materials in other areas.

At present, the country is concentrating its main efforts on developing heavy industry, and it is impossible to invest heavily in local transportation industries, purchase a large number of modern transportation tools, and build modern bridges and road surfaces. Therefore, we must start from the existing foundation. In addition to vigorously carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy in the transportation system, improving efficiency, actively building bridges and roads, and strengthening maintenance; strengthening planned management and maintenance of modern transportation tools to maximize transportation potential; strengthening leadership and management of private transportation industries, carrying out rectification, improving operating efficiency, and gradually implementing socialist transformation; and organizing vehicles from various agencies and enterprises to participate in operations without hindering their use by their own departments, it is also necessary to vigorously organize various backward means of transportation, and, under leadership and in an organized manner, combine with production and disaster relief to mobilize mass transportation to jointly complete the task of material exchange.

Most of Henan Province is a plain area, easy for vehicles to travel. There is a huge potential for transportation using backward tools among the people. In the area south of the Yellow River alone, there are 500,2493 iron-wood wheeled vehicles, in addition to a large number of rubber-tired carts, handcarts, pushcarts, sailboats, bamboo rafts, mules, and horses. The total transport volume of various backward tools reaches 571,772 tons. If all kinds of tools are organized, the daily transport volume can reach 7,592,622 ton-kilometers. In terms of transport volume, this exceeds the transport volume that modern tools can undertake by more than four times. Although this huge transportation force is scattered, backward, slow to operate, and inefficient, as long as it is strengthened and organized to undertake short-distance transportation, and to gather and distribute goods for railway, highway, and river transportation, it can provide an inexhaustible source of transportation power.

In the past few years, the Henan Provincial Department of Transportation has vigorously organized various backward transportation tools, mobilizing mass transportation under the principle of not delaying agricultural work, and assisting modern transportation tools to complete the transportation tasks of various periods. From 1950 to 1953, the volume of freight transported using backward tools and organized mass transportation accounted for more than 90 percent of the total freight volume. From 1951 to 1953, the turnover volume of backward tools accounted for more than 80 to 90 percent of the total turnover volume. Since 1953, although the volume of backward tools has gradually decreased due to the active development of modern transportation tools, it still accounts for the vast majority of the total transport volume. Moreover, due to the continuous growth of industrial and agricultural output, the scope of commodity circulation and material exchange is expanding, and the state and local transportation tasks are becoming increasingly heavy. Backward transportation tools cannot be neglected; on the contrary, leadership, management, and rational organization of use must be further strengthened to give full play to its huge role.

Backward transportation tools are a transportation force that cannot be ignored. However, some cadres and staff in Henan Province have some incorrect views on it. They believe that in large-scale economic construction, transportation should be modernized, otherwise it cannot be adapted to socialist industrialization. They only see the weaknesses of backward tools, such as slow operation and low efficiency, and ignore its huge role, thus relaxing the organizational work for the use of backward transportation tools. In order to correctly exert the effectiveness of backward transportation tools, this incorrect understanding must be overcome. The work of organizing backward transportation tools should also be improved so that it does not delay agricultural work, and can cooperate with the modern state-owned transportation force to complete the ever-increasing transportation tasks.

    不能忽视运用落后的运输工具
    河南省人民政府交通厅副厅长　孙卫和
    随着国家经济建设的迅速发展，物资交流任务日益繁重，河南省的交通运输事业已明显的赶不上客观形势的需要。目前的情况是：货物多、汽车少、道路坏。以许（昌）南（阳）地区为例，一个月的运输任务共二万二千六百一十三吨，而许南线现有的汽车和马车只能完成一万四千七百零四吨的运输任务。由于运力不足，不能及时完成任务，曾造成某些地区物资积压和另一些地区的企业停工待料的现象。
    目前国家正集中主要力量发展重工业，不可能大量投资于地方交通运输业，大量购买现代化运输工具，修筑现代化桥涵和路面。因而必须从现有基础出发，除了在交通系统大力开展增产节约运动，提高效率，积极修建桥路，加强养护；对现代化运输工具，加强计划管理，加强保修，发挥运输潜力；对私营运输业加强领导和管理，进行整顿，提高运行效率，逐步实行社会主义改造；对各机关、企业的车辆，在不妨碍其本部门使用情况下组织参加营运外，还必须大力组织各种落后运输工具，并有领导、有组织地结合生产救灾，发动群众运输，共同完成物资交流任务。
    河南省大部属平原地带，车辆易于行驶，民间潜藏着巨大的落后工具的运输力量，仅黄河以南地区铁木轮车就有五十万零二千四百九十三辆，另外还有大量的胶轮马车、手推车、架子车、帆船、竹筏、骡马等。各种落后工具总运量达五十七万一千七百七十二吨。假如把各种工具都组织起来，每日运量可达七百五十九万二千六百二十二延吨公里。以运量计，超过现代化工具所能承当运量的四百余倍。这支庞大的运输力量虽然分散、落后，运行迟缓、效率不高，但只要加强组织，承担短途运输，为铁路、公路、江河运输集散货源，是可以提供取之不尽、用之不竭的运输力量的。
    几年来，河南省交通厅曾大力组织各种落后运输工具，在不误农时的原则下，发动群众运输，辅助现代化运输工具，完成了各个时期的运输任务。一九五零年至一九五三年中运用落后工具，组织群众运输，所完成的货运量都占总货运量的百分之九十以上。一九五一年至一九五三年，落后工具的运输周转量占总周转量的百分之八十至九十以上。一九五三年以来，虽然由于现代化的运输工具积极发展，落后工具运量逐渐下降，但在总运量中仍占绝大的比重。而且由于工农业产量不断的增长，商品流转，物资交流范围日益扩大，国家和地方运输任务日益繁重，对落后的运输工具，不但不能忽视，相反地，还要进一步加强领导管理和合理组织使用，以发挥它的巨大作用。
    落后的运输工具，是不容忽视的一支运输力量，但是河南省有某些干部和工作人员却对它有一些不正确的看法。他们认为在大规模经济建设中，交通运输应该现代化，否则即不能和社会主义工业化相适应，他们只看到落后工具运行慢、效率低的弱点，而忽视它的巨大的作用，因而放松了对于运用落后运输工具的组织工作。为了正确地发挥落后运输工具的效能，这种不正确的认识必须克服。组织落后运输工具的工作也要加以改进，使它不误农时，而又能配合现代化的国营运输力量，完成日益增长的运输任务。
