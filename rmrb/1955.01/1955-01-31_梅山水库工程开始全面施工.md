    Meishan Reservoir Project Begins Full-Scale Construction

    On the 29th, the builders of the Meishan Reservoir poured the first cubic meter of concrete on the foundation of the reservoir's arch dam. From this point on, the reservoir project has entered a stage of full-scale construction. On the highway from Hefei to Meishan, more than 150 trucks are transporting a large number of equipment and materials needed for the reservoir project to the construction site day and night.

    The Meishan Reservoir's arch dam is scheduled to impound floodwaters during this year's summer flood season. In order to make the reservoir project run ahead of the flood, all employees braved the severe cold of minus 15 degrees Celsius and persisted in construction in the heavy wind and snow. As early as last December, preparations for pouring concrete had already begun. Workers were busy installing mixers and arranging water, electricity, and transportation lines; the equipment supply department rushed to transport a large number of equipment and winter construction insulation equipment. In the stone trough excavation project for the foundation of the arch dam, workers from the mechanized construction brigade increased the efficiency of drilling blast holes by an average of more than double.

    In the concrete pouring project of the Meishan Reservoir, the construction experience of the Fozi Ridge Reservoir will be fully utilized, and the regional management system and segmented parallel flow operation method will be widely promoted. In order to complete the work plan on time and ensure the quality of the project, the reservoir project headquarters and the grassroots construction units signed contract agreements, requiring the level of production management to be raised a step further.

    梅山水库工程开始全面施工
    二十九日，梅山水库的建设者们在水库连拱坝的基础上，浇下了第一方混凝土。从此，水库工程进入全面施工阶段了。从合肥到梅山的公路上，一百五十多辆卡车正日夜把水库工程所需的大批器材物资向工地赶运。
    梅山水库的连拱坝预定要在今年夏汛期间拦蓄洪水。为了使水库工程跑在洪水前面，全体员工曾冒着摄氏零下十五度的严寒，在大风雪中坚持施工。早在去年十二月，浇筑混凝土的准备工作就已开始。工人们紧张进行安装拌和机，布置水、电、交通线路；器材供应科赶运了大批器材和冬季施工的保暖设备。在开挖连拱坝基础的石槽工程中，机筑大队工人把打炮眼的效率平均提高了一倍以上。
    梅山水库在浇筑混凝土工程中，将充分运用佛子岭水库的施工经验，普遍推行区域管理制和分段平行流水作业法。为了按时完成作业计划和保证工程质量，水库工程指挥部和各基层施工单位签订了包工合同，要求把生产管理水平提高一步。　（新华社）
