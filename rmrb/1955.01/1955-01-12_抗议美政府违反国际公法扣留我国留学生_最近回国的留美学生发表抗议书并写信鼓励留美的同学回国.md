Xinhua News Agency, January 11th: Chinese students Mao Hanli, Liang Xiaotian, Fan Xinbi, Song Zhenyu, Zhu Tingru, Li Hengde, Xu Baojiu, Gan Zhenxiang, and others, who recently returned from the United States and arrived in Beijing, have jointly issued a letter of protest against the US government's detention of Chinese students. The protest letter states: "We are Chinese students who have just returned from the United States. The US government has unreasonably and forcibly detained us in the United States for a long time, preventing us from returning to our motherland. As a result of negotiations between our government and the US government at the Geneva Conference, a very small number of us were allowed to leave the United States. However, we are only a tiny fraction of those who are able to return to our motherland. There are still many Chinese students forcibly detained in the United States by the US government, unable to realize their desire to return to the motherland to serve their country and reunite with their families. We strongly protest against this act of the US government, which violates international law and forcibly detains Chinese students."

Since the autumn of 1951, the US government has prohibited Chinese students studying science, engineering, medicine, and other fields from leaving the United States. The US government has subjected Chinese students who requested to return to China to various unreasonable persecutions, forcing them to refrain from applying to return. For example, in September 1951, nine Chinese students were forcibly detained by the US government in Honolulu while en route to China, and later escorted back to the US mainland. The US Immigration and Naturalization Service frequently summoned Chinese students for lengthy interrogations, and sometimes confiscated their passports without reason, using intimidation to prevent Chinese students from reclaiming them. Some Chinese students were also detained by the US Immigration and Naturalization Service under various pretexts. Huang Baotong, from the New York area, was imprisoned for several months.

After the Geneva Conference, the desire of Chinese students in the United States to return to China became even stronger. In August 1954, twenty-six Chinese students wrote to the US President, requesting the cancellation of the order detaining Chinese students. In September 1954, nine Chinese students in Chicago wrote to the US government, expressing their desire to return home. In December, some Chinese students appealed to the United Nations, requesting assistance in realizing their desire to return home. However, these reasonable demands have not been resolved. In response to these demands, the US government announced in December 1954 that it would refuse to allow thirty-five Chinese students who had applied to return home to leave the United States.

We want to point out to the world that the US government's forced detention of Chinese students, preventing them from returning home, is untenable both legally and morally. Chinese students in the United States have not committed any crimes. According to international law, the US government has no reason not to allow them to leave the United States. The US government attempts to sever the connection between Chinese students and their motherland and families, making them people without a country, without parents, wives, or children. This behavior clearly violates the most basic human rights and humanitarian principles.

We demand that the US government immediately cease its unreasonable behavior of forcibly detaining Chinese students, and we also call on fair world opinion to strongly condemn this behavior of the US government, so that Chinese students can realize their desire to return home as soon as possible.

Xinhua News Agency, January 11th: Chinese students Mao Hanli, Liang Xiaotian, Fan Xinbi, Song Zhenyu, Zhu Tingru, Li Hengde, Xu Baojiu, and Gan Zhenxiang, who recently returned from the United States and arrived in Beijing, have jointly written a letter to Chinese students currently in the United States, hoping that they will strive to return to the motherland to serve. The letter states: "At the Geneva Conference held in the spring of 1954, as a result of the victory achieved by our government representatives negotiating with the US government representatives, the US government reluctantly agreed to release twenty-two of the thousands of Chinese students detained in the United States to leave for China. In the autumn of 1954, a few of us individually received letters from the US Immigration and Naturalization Service stating that the previous orders prohibiting us from leaving the United States had now been revoked. After receiving these letters, we hurriedly left the United States and returned to our motherland, which we had not seen for many years. In the short few months since returning home, we have felt that the face of the motherland is very different from when we left. We have seen rapid progress in construction in many places. We are all excited and have taken up our work positions according to our respective majors, and are working together with the people of the whole country for the peaceful construction of socialist industrialization. Although a few of us have been fortunate enough to return to the embrace of the motherland, there are still thousands of Chinese students detained in the United States. Chinese students in the United States: The motherland urgently hopes that you will return to participate in the rapid construction! Striving to return home is an arduous struggle, and even if you cannot immediately realize your wish, we hope you will not be discouraged. Justice is on our side, and your struggle has the support of the people of the motherland and can be victorious. We extend our infinite enthusiasm to wish you success, and hope to shake hands with you in the near future at work positions in the motherland." (Attached picture)

    抗议美政府违反国际公法扣留我国留学生
    最近回国的留美学生发表抗议书并写信鼓励留美的同学回国
   【新华社十一日讯】最近从美国回国到达北京的我国留学生毛汉礼、梁晓天、范新弼、宋振玉、朱廷儒、李恒德、许保玖、甘祯祥等联名发表一封抗议书，对美国政府扣留我国留学生事提出抗议。抗议书说：我们是刚由美国回国的中国留学生。美国政府曾经把我们毫无道理地长期强迫扣留在美国，不许我们回到祖国来。由于我国政府在日内瓦会议上和美国政府交涉的结果，留美学生中极少数的我们几个人才被允许离开美国。但是我们只是能够回到祖国的极少数的几个人。现在仍然有许许多多中国留学生被美国政府强迫扣留在美国，不能实现他们回到祖国来为祖国服务、和家人团聚的愿望。我们对于美国政府这种违反国际公法、强迫扣留中国留学生的行为，表示强烈的抗议。
    从一九五一年秋天以来，美国政府就不准在美国学习理、工、医等科学的中国留学生离开美国。对于要求回国的中国留学生，美国政府加以种种无理的迫害，迫使他们不敢提出回国的要求。例如：在一九五一年九月，有九个中国留学生在回国途中被美国政府在檀香山强迫扣留，以后又被押回美国大陆。美国政府的移民和归化局经常把中国留学生传去作冗长的问话，有时还把他们的护照毫无理由地强行收去，并且用威吓手段使中国留学生不敢去把护照要回。还有一些中国留学生被美国政府的移民和归化局用各种借口拘禁起来。纽约区的黄葆同就被关禁了几个月。
    在日内瓦会议以后，在美国的中国留学生要求回国的愿望更加强烈了。一九五四年八月，有二十六名中国留学生写信给美国总统，要求取消扣留中国留学生的命令。一九五四年九月，又有九名中国留学生在芝加哥写信给美国政府，表示了要求回国的愿望。十二月，又有一些中国留学生向联合国呼吁，要求帮助他们实现回国的愿望。但是这些合理的要求并没有得到解决。作为对这些要求的回答，美国政府在一九五四年十二月宣布拒绝允许申请回国的三十五名中国留学生离开美国。
    我们要向全世界指出，美国政府强迫扣留中国留学生，不许他们回国，无论在法律上、道义上都是站不住脚的。中国留学生在美国并没有犯什么罪。按照国际公法，美国政府没有任何理由不让他们离开美国。美国政府企图割裂中国留学生和他们的祖国和家庭的联系，使他们成为没有祖国、没有父母妻儿的人。这种行为显然违背了最基本的人权和人道主义的准则。
    我们要求美国政府立即停止强迫扣留中国留学生的无理行为，我们也要求世界公正舆论强烈谴责美国政府的这种行为，使中国留学生能早日实现他们的回国的愿望。
     【新华社十一日讯】最近从美国回国到达北京的我国学习自然科学的留学生毛汉礼、梁晓天、范新弼、宋振玉、朱廷儒、李恒德、许保玖、甘祯祥等联名写信给现在在美国的我国留学生，希望他们争取回到祖国服务。信上说：在一九五四年春天举行的日内瓦会议上，由于我国政府代表向美国政府代表交涉取得了胜利，美国政府无可奈何地答应释放被扣在美国的数千中国留学生中的二十二个人离美归国。一九五四年秋天，我们几个人个别地接到了美国移民和归化局的信，说过去给我们的不准离美的命令现在取消了。接到这些信以后，我们就匆促地离开美国，回到了多年不见的祖国。在回国后的短短几个月中，就使我们感到祖国的面貌和我们离国时已经大不相同。我们看到不少地方正在突飞猛进的建设。我们都怀着兴奋的心情，根据自己所学的专业走上了工作岗位，和全国人民一起为社会主义工业化的和平建设而努力。我们几个人虽然已幸运地回到了祖国的怀抱，但是还有数千中国留学生被扣留在美国。在美国的中国同学们：祖国迫切地希望你们回来参加一日千里的建设事业！争取回国是一个艰巨的斗争，一时不能立刻实现愿望，也希望你们不要气馁。正义是在我们这一方面的，你们的斗争有着祖国人民的支援是可以获得胜利的。我们谨以无限的热情，预祝你们成功，希望在不久的将来，和你们在祖国的工作岗位上握手再见。（附图片）
