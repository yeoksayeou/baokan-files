Guangdong Fishery Cooperatives Universally Increase Production

In thirty-four coastal counties of Guangdong Province, eighty-nine fishery production cooperatives have now been established.

These fishery production cooperatives, due to giving play to the superiority of unified management and collective labor, have universally achieved bumper harvests. According to statistics from eleven fishery production cooperatives on Hainan Island, from the beginning of October to the end of November 1954, they caught a total of more than 30,000 dan of fish, an average increase of 93 percent compared to when they worked individually. Among them, six cooperatives increased production fourfold compared to the same period last year.

    广东渔业合作社普遍增产
    广东省沿海三十四个县内，现在已建成了八十九个渔业生产合作社。
    这些渔业生产合作社，由于发挥了统一经营、集体劳动的优越性，普遍获得丰收。据海南岛十一个渔业生产合作社统计，从一九五四年十月初到十一月底止，共捕鱼三万多担，平均比单干时增产百分之九十三，其中有六个社比去年同期增产四倍。
