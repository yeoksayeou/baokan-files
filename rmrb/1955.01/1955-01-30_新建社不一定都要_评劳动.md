To the Editor:

    With the increasing development and improvement of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, many mutual aid teams have adopted the "piece-rate system" based on the principle of payment according to work. The past method of "fixed points and flexible evaluation" has, in fact, been unable to fully adapt to the current practical needs. In the pilot work of establishing cooperatives in the autumn of 1954, although we also conducted "labor evaluation" according to the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women, the enthusiasm of the cooperative members was not high. Several cooperative cadres raised the question, "What's the point of evaluating? It's all the same whether we evaluate or not!" This reflection from the masses is indeed worth considering, because: "Labor evaluation" takes up a lot of time and has little effect. Therefore, I suggest that in establishing cooperatives in various regions, we can decide whether or not to "evaluate labor" based on the point-based work scoring method used before the team was converted into a cooperative, and not conduct "labor evaluation" across the board. Moreover, I think that even if some cooperatives still adopt the "fixed points and flexible evaluation" method at the beginning of their establishment, there is no need to evaluate livestock and farm tools together; the base points can be evaluated at the end of the establishment of the cooperative.

### 新建社不一定都要“评劳动”

    新建社不一定都要“评劳动”编辑同志：
    在互助合作运动日益发展和提高的情况下，很多互助组都采用了按劳取酬原则的“按件计工”制，过去采用“死分活评”的办法，事实上已不能完全适应当前的实际需要。在一九五四年秋季建社的试点工作中，我们虽然也按男女同工同酬的原则进行了“评劳动”，但社员们劲头不大，好几个社干部都提出“评不评还是一样，有啥评头？”群众这个反映确实值得我们考虑。因为：“评劳动”多占时间，作用不大。因此我建议各地在建社中，可以根据组转社前使用的评分计工办法来决定是否需要
  “评劳动”的问题，不要一律都进行“评劳动”。而且我觉得即使有的社初建时仍采用了“死分活评”的办法，也不必和牲口、农具一起评，可以在建社末期再评底分。
