To meet the needs of the growing people's sports undertakings, the Physical Culture and Sports Commission of the People's Republic of China and the Ministry of Higher Education have successively established sports colleges in Beijing, Shanghai, Nanchang, Chengdu, Shenyang, and Xi'an. Except for the Central Sports College, which has a research department, the other colleges only have undergraduate, specialized, and secondary vocational classes. The research department specializes in training future sports teachers for universities and colleges, and currently has 215 researchers, most of whom are sports workers who graduated from the original university sports departments and have a certain amount of work experience. The specialized classes train sports teachers and sports administrative cadres for secondary schools and currently have 1,774 students. The secondary vocational classes specialize in training teachers and workers for junior high schools and grassroots sports organizations, and currently have 752 students (which will be appropriately expanded in 1955).

In teaching, the sports colleges fully utilize the advanced experience of Soviet higher sports schools. In order to gradually develop scientific research in sports, the Central Sports College has invited three Soviet experts to the school to preside over the teaching work. Due to the colleges' conscientious absorption of Soviet experience, they have achieved certain teaching results. The number of young people volunteering to apply for sports colleges is increasing year by year, absenteeism among students has been basically eliminated, and students have shown significant changes in their intellectual and physical development.

    培养新中国的体育人材
    为了满足日益发展的人民体育事业的需要，中华人民共和国体育运动委员会和高等教育部已先后在北京、上海、南昌、成都、沈阳和西安设立了体育学院。除中央体育学院设有研究部外，其他各学院只设本科、专修科和中等专业班。研究部专门培养未来的高等学校体育师资，现有研究员二百十五人，他们大多是原高等学校体育系科毕业、并有一定工作经验的体育工作者。专修科则为中等学校培养体育师资和体育行政干部，现在拥有一千七百七十四名学生。中等专业班则专为初级中学和基层体育机构培养教师和工作者，目前在学人数有七百五十二人（一九五五年内将会适当扩大）。
    各体育学院在教学中充分运用了苏联高等体育学校的先进经验。为逐步发展体育的科学研究工作，中央体育学院已邀请三位苏联专家来校主持教学工作。由于各学院认真吸取苏联经验，在教学中都已获得一定的教学效果。志愿投考体育学院的青年逐年增加，学员的旷课现象基本上已消灭，学生们在智力和体力方面的发展也有较显著的变化。
