    Rural Peddlers Organized Around Supply and Marketing Cooperatives

    Supply and marketing cooperatives in Enshi, Xiaogan, Zaoyang, Dangyang, Xishui and other places in Hubei Province have begun to organize rural mobile peddlers in a planned manner. According to incomplete statistics on January 15, there were already 70 mobile peddler organizations around the supply and marketing cooperatives in these areas.

    Since the beginning of December last year, the supply and marketing cooperatives in these areas have successively established business relationships such as distribution and purchasing on commission with a group of peddlers. At the same time, according to the needs of the local people and the plans of the supply and marketing cooperatives, they appropriately arranged the peddlers' sales volume and reasonably stipulated the wholesale and retail price differences, so that the peddlers could obtain reasonable profits. By organizing peddlers to go to the countryside, the rural economy has been further enlivened, and the purchasing and sales business of the supply and marketing cooperatives has been expanded. Two peddlers in Longfengba, Enshi County, purchased more than 1.3 million yuan worth of scrap copper, scrap tin, eggs and miscellaneous bones in the mountainous area in 18 days. Mobile peddlers in the third district of Zaoyang County sold more than 9.7 million yuan worth of general merchandise and groceries for the supply and marketing cooperatives in five days. Supply and marketing cooperatives organize peddlers to go to the countryside, which facilitates the purchase and sale of goods by the masses. Some people in Chongyang, Enshi and other places said: With the supply and marketing cooperatives leading the peddlers, it is more convenient to buy and sell things, and the price has also been "corrected."

    农村小贩组织在供销社周围
    湖北省恩施、孝感、枣阳、当阳、浠水等地的供销合作社，开始有计划地进行组织农村流动小贩的工作。据一月十五日的不完全统计，这些地方已经有七十个流动小贩组织在供销合作社的周围。
    从去年十二月初以来，这些地区的供销合作社先后同一批小贩建立了经销、代购等业务关系；同时，根据当地群众的需要、供销合作社的计划等，适当地安排了小贩的营业额，并合理地规定了批零差价等，使小贩们得到合理的利润。通过组织小贩下乡，进一步活跃了农村经济，扩大了供销合作社的购销业务。恩施县龙凤坝两名小贩在山区十八天收购了价值一百三十多万元的废铜、废锡、鸡蛋和杂骨等物品。枣阳县第三区的流动小贩，五天为供销合作社销售了价值九百七十多万元的百货和杂货。供销合作社组织小贩下乡，便利了群众购买和出售货物。崇阳、恩施等地有些群众说：供销合作社领导着小贩，买卖东西方便了，价钱也“归正”了。　（姜德芬等）
