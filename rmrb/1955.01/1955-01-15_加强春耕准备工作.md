Strengthen Spring Ploughing Preparations

Our country has entered the third year of the Five-Year Plan construction. According to the requirements of the national plan, this year's agricultural production tasks are very arduous. Our country suffered from unprecedented floods last year. Although through various efforts, the total grain output of the country still increased by about 3% compared with the previous year, it did not fulfill the national agricultural production increase plan of last year. This year is a decisive year for the country's Five-Year Plan construction. The demand for agricultural products from the state and the people has increased even more. In order to ensure the balanced development of national economic construction and the needs of people's lives, it is necessary to strive to complete and over-fulfill this year's agricultural production tasks. Making early preparations for spring ploughing is the primary step in completing this year's agricultural production plan.

At present, the various tasks in the rural areas are extremely heavy. Although party and government leading organs at all levels attach great importance to completing various tasks in conjunction with production, and have achieved certain results as a result, in many areas, winter production is still in a state of laissez-faire. Autumn plowing, fertilizer accumulation, land improvement, and other production activities have not been widely carried out. For example, in some cotton-producing areas such as Handan, Hebei Province, some cotton stalks have not yet been cleared. The management of small spring crops in some areas of the south is quite rough. Many newly established agricultural production cooperatives have not seriously formulated production plans and organized winter production. In a considerable number of disaster-stricken areas, there has been a serious phenomenon of livestock price drops and illegal slaughter. These phenomena show that the production enthusiasm of some farmers is not very stable, which is very unfavorable to agricultural production.

Eliminating the ideological concerns of farmers, encouraging their production enthusiasm, and correcting various deviations in the work in a timely manner are the keys to promoting the current agricultural production. All areas where there are fluctuations in mass sentiment should seriously examine the implementation of various policies and the ideological sentiment of farmers, analyze the reasons for this phenomenon, and further explain the party's policies to farmers in response to their ideological problems. Some farmers in Fuyu County, Jilin Province, believed the rumor that "the government will soon ban pig slaughtering" and prepared to slaughter a large number of pigs. County and district cadres promptly exposed the rumor to the masses and clarified the policy, and the farmers' thinking returned to normal. This incident shows that as long as our political work and propaganda work can keep up in time and explain the truth to farmers, they will believe the policies. Socialist measures absolutely do not have fundamental conflicts with the economic interests of farmers. Therefore, some temporary difficulties in the work are by no means insurmountable. As long as we patiently explain and educate the farmers and earnestly correct the shortcomings and errors in the work, the farmers' production enthusiasm will soon rise.

Production is the most concerned issue for the broad masses of farmers. As long as we are good at relying on the enthusiasm of farmers' mutual assistance and cooperation to develop production, the production movement will be well carried out. No matter whether the unified purchase and sale of grain is in progress or has ended, no matter whether the establishment of cooperatives is in progress or has entered the consolidation stage, leadership of production should invariably be regarded as the primary task at present. When launching production, there should be no slightest neglect of individual farmers; frustrating their enthusiasm is detrimental to the entire production cause.

In carrying out spring ploughing preparations, special attention should be paid to the advanced leading role of agricultural production cooperatives. This spring, the number of agricultural production cooperatives across the country will increase to 600,000, and the organized ranks of agricultural production will be greatly strengthened compared with last year. This is an extremely favorable condition for this year's agricultural production. Established cooperatives should start with production and carry out rectification and consolidation work. Various tasks of cooperatives that are being established should be carried out in conjunction with production. Currently, some newly established cooperatives have not yet formulated production plans, the labor organization is lax, and the members are waiting and watching. This is extremely detrimental to spring ploughing preparations. We should combine the rectification and consolidation work of newly established cooperatives and organize members to immediately engage in production.

A major issue worthy of attention in current production is the livestock issue. At present, our country does not yet have a large number of agricultural machines, and animal power is still the main driving force for agriculture. This year, our country will promote a large number of new-style animal-powered farm tools, and the issue of draft animals has become even more important. Since the beginning of winter, some disaster areas have experienced a phenomenon of livestock price drops and excessive slaughter of old and weak livestock. If attention is not paid to handling this, the driving force of agricultural production will suffer considerable losses, which will cause serious difficulties for spring ploughing production. All localities must regard livestock protection as a political task and take appropriate measures in response to specific reasons. If this phenomenon occurs because less feed is retained in the unified purchase, it should be appropriately resolved in the unified sale. If it is because the cooperative's implementation of policies related to privately owned means of production has deviations, it should be corrected. If it is caused by famine, we should try to find production avenues, or launch mutual assistance and mutual aid, organize foster care, near-ground adjustment and other methods to protect livestock to safely survive the winter. In short, we must strengthen the education of farmers on livestock protection, expose various rumors, and mobilize the masses to find ways to protect livestock. In addition, we must strictly manage the livestock market, organize livestock exchanges in various places, stabilize livestock prices, and seriously deal with illegal slaughterhouses to prevent further losses of livestock.

Promoting production in disaster areas has a particularly important meaning in this year's agricultural production. The areas that suffered floods last year are mostly important grain and cotton producing areas. Doing a good job in production in these areas is not only necessary for the people in the disaster areas, but also has a great relationship with the realization of the national agricultural production plan. Party and government leading organs in disaster areas must overcome all difficulties and lead the disaster victims to create conditions for restoring production. Relevant economic departments should fully support the struggle of the people in the disaster areas to help themselves through production, do a good job in material support and supply, organize various sideline productions with raw materials and sales channels, and open up production avenues to ensure that the disaster victims overcome the famine and prepare for agricultural production. The phenomenon of not considering the long term and only caring about immediate life, which has occurred in some disaster areas, must be corrected. We must educate the disaster victims to understand the relationship between production in disaster areas and national construction, encourage them to persevere in their efforts, do a good job in production, continue to overcome disasters, and strive for a bumper harvest this year.

Various preparatory work for spring ploughing production should be comprehensively considered and started as early as possible in all localities based on local conditions and different seasons. Last year, many areas had insufficient base fertilizer for winter wheat, and winter fertilizer accumulation work was not carried out well. We should lead farmers to launch a fertilizer accumulation movement before spring ploughing to make up for the lack of winter fertilizer accumulation, ensure that there is base fertilizer for spring sowing this year, and topdressing fertilizer for wheat. Seed issues should also be checked and prepared early. In cotton-producing areas, because the issue of self-retained seed ginning has not been well resolved, many cotton farmers lack seeds. In some areas, insufficient attention was paid to the issue of seed retention during the unified purchase of grain, which further affected seed reserves. In Baoding Prefecture, Hebei Province, farmers used to retain about half of their seeds, but this year it is estimated that only 15 percent will be retained. This is a serious problem that must be prepared for as early as possible to avoid affecting spring ploughing. In order to ensure the increase in agricultural production this year, various agricultural technology improvement work should also be carried out as early as possible. With the development of the cooperative movement, technical extension stations can be appropriately added in areas with conditions to promote those effective experiences in increasing production. In addition, the demonstration and promotion of new-style animal-powered farm tools such as double-wheeled double-shared plows and technical training work should also be inspected and promoted so that new farm tools can play their due role in spring ploughing this year.

Last year, there was a lot of rain and the harvest of late autumn crops was relatively late. Due to the rush of time, the sowing quality of crops such as wheat and rapeseed was not good enough. Therefore, field management of wheat and small spring crops in the south must be strengthened. All localities should also use the gap before spring ploughing to carry out various small-scale water conservancy construction to enhance drought resistance and flood prevention capabilities.

In order to enable the preparatory work for spring ploughing to be carried out in a planned manner, all localities can hold appropriate meetings to summarize last year's experience in increasing production, formulate production plans and sowing plans for the region based on the national plan, and lead new and old agricultural production cooperatives to formulate corresponding plans so that farmers have clear goals and know what to do. This process of planning and summarizing should become a mobilization and preparation process for spring ploughing production.

Winter is about to pass, and the tense spring ploughing production season is approaching. This year's rural work will be tense, and there will be more difficulties. Party leading organs in all localities must give full play to the party's leadership art and combat effectiveness, grasp the key points of the work, carry forward the traditional spirit of overcoming difficulties, and create conditions for the victory of agricultural production in 1955.

    加强春耕准备工作
    我们国家已进入五年计划建设的第三年，按照国家计划的要求，今年的农业生产任务是十分艰巨的。我国去年遭受了百年未有的洪水，虽然经过多方面的努力，全国粮食的总产量仍然比前年增加了百分之三左右，但就去年全国农业的增产计划来说是没有完成的；今年是国家五年计划建设有决定意义的一年，国家和人民对农业产品的需求更提高了。为了保证国家经济建设的平衡发展和人民生活的需要，必须努力完成和超额完成今年农业生产任务。及早作好春耕准备工作，乃是完成今年农业生产计划的首要步骤。
    当前农村各项工作任务是极为繁重的。各地党政领导机关虽然十分重视结合生产完成各项任务，因而取得了一定的成绩；但是，在许多地区，冬季生产仍然处于自流状态，秋耕、积肥、修整土地等生产活动，并未普遍开展起来。例如，河北省邯郸等棉产区有些棉柴至今还未清除。南方部分地区的小春作物管理相当粗放。许多新建的农业生产合作社一直没有认真地制订生产计划和组织冬季生产。相当一部分受灾地区，出现了牲畜跌价贱卖和违格宰杀的严重现象。这些现象说明部分农民生产情绪不很稳定，这对农业生产是十分不利的。
    消除农民的思想顾虑，鼓舞农民的生产积极性，适时地纠正各种工作中的偏差，这是推动当前农业生产的关键。凡有群众情绪动荡现象的地区，都要认真检查各项政策的执行情况和农民的思想情绪，分析产生这种现象的原因，针对农民的思想问题，进一步向农民解释党的政策。吉林省扶余县有些农民，听信“政府快不许杀猪了”的谣言，准备大量杀猪，县区干部及时向群众揭穿谣言，讲清政策，农民思想即归正常。这件事情说明，只要我们的政治工作和宣传工作能及时赶上去，向农民讲清道理，农民是会相信政策的。社会主义措施同农民的经济利益绝对没有根本抵触，因此，工作中的一些暂时的困难绝不是不可克服的。只要向农民耐心进行解释教育，并且认真纠正工作中的缺点和错误，农民的生产情绪很快就会高涨起来。
    生产是广大农民群众最关心的事情，只要善于依靠农民互助合作的积极性来发展生产，生产运动是会很好地开展起来的。不论粮食统购统销正在进行或已结束的地区，不论建社工作正在进行或已进入巩固阶段的地区，都应毫不例外地把领导生产作为当前的首要任务。在发动生产时候，对个体农民不能有丝毫的忽视；挫折他们的积极性，对整个生产事业是不利的。
    进行春耕准备工作，要特别注意农业生产合作社的先进带头作用。今春全国农业生产合作社要发展到六十万个，农业生产的有组织的队伍比去年大大加强了，这是今年农业生产的极为有利的条件；已建立的合作社要从生产入手，进行整顿巩固工作。正在建立的合作社的各种工作，都要结合生产进行。现在有些新建的社还没有订立生产计划，劳动组织涣散，社员等待观望，这对春耕准备工作极为不利。应该结合新建社的整顿巩固工作，组织社员立即投入生产。
    当前生产中值得注意的一个重大问题是牲畜问题。现在我国还没有大批农业机器，畜力还是农业的主要动力。今年我国要推广大批新式畜力农具，耕畜问题就显得更为重要。入冬以来，有些灾区发生牲畜跌价、宰杀老弱牲畜过多的现象，如果不注意处理，会使农业生产的动力受到相当损失，会给春耕生产造成严重困难。各地必须把保畜问题当作一项政治任务，针对具体原因，采取适当的措施。发生这种现象，如果是因为统购中饲料留的少了，就要在统销中加以适当解决；如果是因为合作社执行有关私有生产资料的政策有偏差，就要加以纠正；如果是因为灾荒所引起，就要设法找寻生产门路，或发动互助互济、组织寄养、近地调节等办法，保护牲畜安全过冬。总之，要加强对农民的保畜教育，揭穿各种谣言，发动群众想办法来保护牲畜。此外，还要严格管理牲畜市场，组织各地牲畜交流，稳定畜价，严肃处理非法屠宰户，以防止牲畜再遭损失。
    推动灾区生产，在今年农业生产中有着特殊重要的意义。去年遭受水灾的区域多为重要的粮棉产区，作好这些地区的生产工作，不仅为灾区人民所必需，对国家农业生产计划的实现也有很大关系。灾区的党政领导机关要克服一切困难，领导灾民创造恢复生产的条件。各有关经济部门要全力支持灾区人民生产自救的斗争，作好物资支援和供应工作，组织各种有原料有销路的副业生产，广辟生产门路，保证灾民渡过灾荒，并为农业生产做好准备。目前部分灾区发生的不从长远考虑只顾眼前生活的现象，必须加以纠正。要教育灾民认识灾区生产和国家建设的关系，鼓励他们坚持努力，搞好生产，继续战胜灾害，争取今年的丰收。
    春耕生产的各项准备工作，各地要根据当地情况和不同节令，全盘考虑，及早着手。去年许多地区的冬小麦的底肥不足，冬季积肥工作又没有很好进行。我们应该领导农民开展一个春耕前的积肥运动，以弥补冬季积肥的不足，保证今年春播有底肥，小麦有追肥。种籽问题也要早作检查准备。在产棉区，由于自留种轧花问题没有很好解决，许多棉农缺乏种籽；有些地区粮食统购时对留种问题注意不够，更影响到种籽的储备。河北保定专区往年农民自留种约占半数，今年估计只有百分之十五。这是一个严重问题，必须及早准备，以免影响春耕。为保证今年农业增产，各种农业技术改良工作也要及早进行，随着合作化运动的发展，有条件的地区可适当增设技术推广站，推广那些行之有效的增产经验。此外，对双轮双铧犁等新式畜力农具的示范推广和技术训练工作，也要加以检查推动，使新农具在今年春耕中能发挥应有的作用。
    去年雨水很大，晚秋作物收获较迟，由于时间仓促，小麦、油菜等作物播种质量都不够好。因此，小麦及南方小春作物的田间管理必须加强。各地还应该利用春耕前的空隙，进行各种小型水利建设，以增强抗旱、防涝的力量。
    为使春耕准备工作能有计划地进行，各地可举行适当的会议，总结去年增产经验，根据国家计划订出本地区的生产计划和播种计划，并领导新老农业生产合作社作出相应的计划，使农民目标明确，心中有数。这个计划和总结的过程，应当成为春耕生产的动员和准备过程。
    冬季快要过去了，紧张的春耕生产季节即将到来。今年的农村工作将是紧张的，困难也会是更多的。各地党的领导机关要发挥党的领导艺术和战斗力，抓紧工作关键，发扬克服困难的传统精神，给一九五五年农业生产的胜利创造条件。
