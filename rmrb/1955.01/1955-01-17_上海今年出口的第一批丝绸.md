Shanghai's First Export of Silk This Year

The first batch of raw silk and silk fabrics exported by the Shanghai Branch of the China Silk Company this year has been shipped on January 1st and 4th. Among them are rayon printed georgette velvet, patterned soft satin, Tianxiang silk, and pure silk patterned quilt covers, which are most popular with the Soviet people.

This year, the Shanghai Branch of the China Silk Company has increased the variety of exported silk fabrics by more than 300 patterns, including "Phoenix Picking Peonies," "Peacock Screen," "Magpie Plum," and "Butterfly Orchid." The variety has increased by ten types, including Peace Silk, Dawn Crepe, Cicada Wing Gauze, and Snow Shadow Check.

Last year, the employees of the Shanghai Branch of the China Silk Company overfulfilled the silk export tasks to the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries twenty days ahead of schedule. The foreign exchange earned from these exported silks can buy more than 170,000 tons of steel and complete equipment for six 25,000-kilowatt thermal power plants. The quantity of silk exported this year will increase compared to last year, and the silk fabrics shipped to the Soviet Union in the first quarter will increase by 20.15% compared to the first quarter of last year.
