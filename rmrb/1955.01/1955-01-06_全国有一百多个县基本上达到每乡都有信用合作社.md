In the upsurge of vigorously developing credit cooperative organizations in various places, more than one hundred counties nationwide have basically achieved credit cooperatives in every township. According to statistics from the People's Bank of China, as of the end of August last year, only twenty-three counties nationwide had established credit cooperatives in every township. Currently, one hundred and fourteen counties in fifteen provinces across the country have basically achieved credit cooperatives in every township. Among them, Zhejiang Province has twenty counties, Shanxi Province has seventeen counties, Yunnan Province has sixteen counties, Liaoning Province has thirteen counties, and Hebei Province has eleven counties; other provinces such as Shandong, Shaanxi, and Hubei each have from one to nine counties. The number of farm households participating in credit cooperatives in these counties generally accounts for more than 60% of the total number of farm households in the county eligible to join the cooperatives. In Pingle County, Guangxi Province, the proportion of participating farm households is as high as 90%, and in Dongxiang County, Jiangxi Province, Yingcheng County, Hubei Province, and Jiashan County, Zhejiang Province, the number of participating farm households is all above 80%.
