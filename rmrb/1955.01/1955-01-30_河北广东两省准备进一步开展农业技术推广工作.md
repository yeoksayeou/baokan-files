    Hebei and Guangdong provinces are preparing to further develop agricultural technology extension work.
    In order to guarantee the realization of the province's agricultural production increase plan, Hebei Province will focus on agricultural production cooperatives this year, with the double-wheeled double-share plow and other technologies as the core of its technology extension work.
    This year, Hebei Province plans to promote, through agricultural production cooperatives, a focused effort to extend the use of 69,000 double-wheeled double-share plows, and 48,000 double-wheeled single-share plows, new-style walking plows, and other implements. In the process of promoting these new agricultural implements, various localities will, under the guidance of agricultural technology extension stations, systematically cultivate 2,500 large and medium-sized agricultural production cooperatives, enabling them to drive the surrounding agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and farmers to carry out technological reforms centered on increasing agricultural production. Through technological reforms, 200,000 agricultural technicians are to be trained within each cooperative and team. At the same time, Hebei Province also plans to further promote improved seeds, requiring that the planting area of improved wheat seeds be expanded by one million mu compared to last year, the planting area of improved millet seeds be expanded by two million mu compared to last year, and the planting area of improved corn seeds be expanded by 500,000 mu. Agricultural production cooperatives in various localities must take the lead in implementing close planting of crops such as cotton, wheat, and corn. Various localities should also vigorously promote artificial auxiliary pollination of corn and further improve farmers' techniques in cotton pruning, fruit tree pruning, and pest and disease control.
    In order to ensure the realization of the above plan, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Hebei Provincial People's Government is actively strengthening the work of agricultural technology extension stations. The more than 600 agricultural technology extension stations throughout the province, which were previously led separately by counties and districts, will be unified under the leadership of the counties from this year onwards. Currently, more than 3,000 cadres of the agricultural technology extension stations are being concentrated in various special districts for short-term training. After the training is completed, a mass technical training campaign will be launched throughout the province. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Guangdong Province is preparing to further develop agricultural technology reform. This year, the province will promote the close planting of rice seedlings on 25 million mu, promote improved rice seeds on more than 7 million mu, promote more than 40,000 various new types of paddy field plows and double-wheeled double-share plows, and improve the sandy fields of the Pearl River Delta. The province's counties originally had more than 170 agricultural technology extension stations, and a number will be added this year. Agricultural technology extension stations will be established in all five key counties and districts. The province will use these agricultural technology extension stations and nearly 100 demonstration farms as bases, and drive individual farmers through mutual aid and cooperative organizations to carry out agricultural technology reform. Currently, the first batch of more than 400 technical cadres and students who have been transferred to add agricultural technology extension stations have been assigned to work in various places. The work of the counties in training technicians for agricultural production cooperatives is also underway; after the training is completed in February, the province's 13,000 agricultural production cooperatives can have 50,000 technicians.

    河北广东两省准备进一步开展农业技术推广工作
    河北省农村今年将开展以农业生产合作社为重点、以双轮双铧犁等为中心的技术推广工作，来保证全省农业增产计划的实现。
    今年河北省计划通过农业生产合作社，有重点地推广双轮双铧犁六万九千部，双轮一铧犁、新式步犁等四万八千部。各地在推广这些新式农具过程中，将在农业技术推广站指导下，有计划地培养好二千五百个大、中型的农业生产合作社，使它们能带动周围的农业生产合作社、互助组和农民，开展以农业增产为中心的技术改革工作。经过技术改革，要在各社、组内培养出二十万个农业技术员。同时，河北省还计划进一步推广良种，要求做到小麦良种的种植面积比去年扩大一百万亩，谷子良种的种植面积比去年扩大二百万亩，玉米良种的种植面积比去年扩大五十万亩。各地农业生产合作社要首先带头做好棉花、小麦、玉米等作物的密植。各地还要大力推广玉米人工辅助授粉，进一步提高农民对棉花整枝、果树修剪和病虫害防治等的技术。
    为了保证上述计划的实现，河北省人民政府农林厅正在积极加强农业技术推广站的工作。过去由县、区分别领导的全省六百多个农业技术推广站，从今年起将全部改由各县统一领导。目前各农业技术推广站三千多名干部正分别集中在各专区进行短期训练。训练完毕后，全省即将开展一次群众性的技术传授。（新华社）
    广东省准备进一步开展农业技术改革。今年全省将推行水稻小科密植二千五百万亩，推广水稻良种七百多万亩，推广各种新式水田犁、双轮双铧犁四万多部和改良珠江三角洲的沙田。全省各县原有农业技术推广站一百七十多个，今年将增设一部分。其中五个重点县区区都要建立农业技术推广站。全省将以这些农业技术推广站和近百个示范农场为基点，通过互助合作组织带动单干农民，来开展农业技术改革。现在，为增设农业技术推广站而抽调的第一批技术干部和学生四百多名，已分配到各地工作。各县训练农业生产合作社技术员的工作也在进行；到二月间训练完毕后，全省一万三千个农业生产合作社就可以有五万名技术员。　（新华社）
