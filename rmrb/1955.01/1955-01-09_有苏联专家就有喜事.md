    With Soviet Experts, There is Good News
    Lěng Bǎoqí
    Soviet expert Comrade Khatinsky is already over fifty years old, but no matter the wind or rain, he is always at the forefront. During the busiest times of work, he doesn't even rest on Sundays, helping with installation in the forging workshop. To ensure that the three-ton die forging hammer could be obediently manipulated by the workers, he worked late into the night compiling handouts and preparing lessons for the workers. When advised to rest, he said, "Rest is a good thing for me, but a bad thing for the machine."
    Last April, the workshop was forging handle bodies for lightweight rock drills. Because the shape of this handle body was complex and the quality difficult to control, the workshop's monthly reject rate exceeded the prescribed rate by more than two times. The factory and the workshop had held many production meetings to solve this problem, but they could never find a solution.
    One day, Comrade Khatinsky came to the forging hammer. He saw three clever forging workers – one holding a shovel, one holding tongs, and one holding a rake – nervously knocking at the parts to remove the iron oxide scale. But the iron oxide scale was reluctant to fall off. Iron scale splattered everywhere, and if you weren't careful, it could leave a small scar on your face.
    Workshop Director Wang walked up and pointed to the iron oxide scale, saying to the expert, "We have to deal with this fellow."
    Comrade Khatinsky thought for a moment and said, "Please prepare a bucket of water and half a bucket of salt immediately."
    Everyone was a little puzzled, why use water and salt? Comrade Khatinsky pointed to the iron oxide scale and said, "I want to do an experiment using salt to remove the iron oxide scale."
    The salt and water were prepared. Comrade Khatinsky rolled up his sleeves and started working. As the workers gathered around, he explained and demonstrated how to do it. The workers nodded repeatedly, indicating that they understood.
      "If you understand, then let's start!" the old expert said with a smile to the workers. Forging worker Xiao Li deftly dragged a blank from the sparking heating furnace, clamped it with tongs, dipped it into the salt bucket, and then quickly dipped it into the water. With a "ping" sound, the blank, which was originally covered in iron oxide scale, instantly turned into a shiny object.
      "It's really the right medicine for the disease!" Forging worker Xiao Zhang jumped up with joy and said with a smile.
    Forging team leader Yang Jishun looked at the smooth forgings that had just been forged, and then looked at the set of tools such as shovels and tongs specially used to remove iron oxide scale. He gratefully said to Comrade Khatinsky, "Thank you, you solved this key problem for us."
    The workshop branch secretary said, "Comrades! There is a popular saying in our workshop: 'Wherever there is a production bottleneck, there are Soviet experts; wherever there are Soviet experts, there is sure to be good news.' Today, it has been confirmed again!"

    有苏联专家就有喜事
    冷宝祺
    苏联专家哈青斯基同志已经五十多岁了，但无论是在风里雨里，他总是走在头里。在工作最忙的时候，他星期天也不休息，在锻压车间帮助安装。为了使三吨模锻锤能很驯顺的服从工人们的摆弄，他忙到深夜编讲义，给工人备课。劝他休息，他说：“休息对我来说是个好事，但对机器来说却是一个坏事。”
    去年四月，车间锻轻便凿岩机上的柄体。因为这个柄体的形状复杂，质量不好掌握，车间每月的废品率都超过规定的两倍。厂部、车间为了解决这个困难，曾经开过不少次生产会议，可是总也找不出解决的办法来。
    一天，哈青斯基同志来到了锻锤跟前。他看见三个机伶的锻工——一个拿着铲子，一个拿着钳子，还有一个拿着捞子，紧张地敲着部件的氧化铁皮。可是氧化铁皮就是不愿往下掉。铁皮四处飞溅，一不小心，它就会使你脸上留个小疤。
    车间王主任迎面走来，指着氧化铁皮对专家说：“非得治治这家伙不可。”
    哈青斯基同志思考了一下，说：“请马上准备一桶水和半桶盐。”
    大家有些纳闷，干吗用水和盐呢？哈青斯基同志指着氧化铁皮说：“我想做一次用盐消除氧化铁皮的试验。”
   盐、水都准备好了。哈青斯基同志就挽起袖子干起来。当工人们都围上来的时候，他就一面讲，一面比方怎样做。工人们都连连点头，表示听懂了。
      “听懂了，那就开始干吧！”老专家微笑着向工人说道。锻工小李灵敏地从火花四射的加热炉里，拖出一块毛胚，用钳子夹着，向盐桶里一插，然后迅速地向水里一沾。“乒”的一声，原来满身氧化铁皮的毛胚，刹那间便变成一个光亮亮的东西。
      “真是对症下药！”锻工小张高兴得跳起来，笑嘻嘻地说。
   锻工组长杨吉顺望了一下刚锻出来的光溜溜的锻件，又看了看那些专为去掉氧化铁皮用的铲子、钳子等一套工具，感激地向哈青斯基同志说：“谢谢您，您给我们解决这个关键问题。”
    车间支部书记说：“同志们！咱们车间流行的一句话：‘哪里有生产关键，哪里就有苏联专家；哪里有苏联专家，哪里就一定有喜事。’今天又被证实了！”
