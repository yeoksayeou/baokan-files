    The First Flower Production Cooperative
    The Fengtai area in the southwestern suburbs of Beijing is a region rich in flower production. In order to improve flower production and meet the needs of the city, flower farmers in Caoqiao Township, Fengtai District, formed the first flower production cooperative in October of last year.

    After the establishment of the cooperative, the members greatly increased their enthusiasm for production. The output of flowers in the two months of winter increased by 20% compared to the same period of the previous year. Winter flowers such as "Poinsettia" and "Globe Amaranth" sufficiently met the market's needs. When selling flowers, the members carefully packaged them to prevent damage during transport. Now, many out-of-town organizations, such as the Taiyuan Railway Administration and the Shijiazhuang Workers' Middle School, have signed pre-purchase contracts with the cooperative.

    This year, the cooperative will further expand its greenhouse equipment and focus on increasing the cultivation of woody flowers such as magnolias and camellias from the South. The cooperative's production plan will increase by 20% compared to last year. It is currently actively entering into supply contracts with various organizations and units. (Jiao Qingshui, Jin Lan)

    第一个鲜花生产合作社
    北京市西南郊丰台一带是个盛产鲜花的地区，为了改进鲜花生产，供应城市的需要，丰台区草桥乡的花农们在去年十月间组成了第一个鲜花生产合作社。
    合作社组成后，社员们大大地发挥了生产积极性。冬季两个多月中的鲜花产量，比前一年同期增加二成，“一品红”、“千日莲”等冬季鲜花，充分地供应了市场需要。出售鲜花时，社员们细心包扎，使途中不受损失。现在很多外地机关如太原铁路管理局、石家庄职工中学等单位，都和合作社签订了预购合同。
    这个合作社今年将进一步扩大温室设备，有重点地增种木本鲜花如南方的玉兰、茶花等，全社生产计划比去年增加百分之二十。现正积极和各地机关单位订立供应合同。（焦清水、金岚）
