	Refining a Large Quantity of Silkworm Pupae into Pupa Oil

    The Jiangsu Provincial People's Government's Department of Industry recently added a workshop for refining silkworm pupa oil to the local state-owned Suzhou No. 1 Silk Filature and is preparing to build a new silkworm pupa oil factory in Wuxi.

    The Jiangsu area is rich in silk production, and in the past, the large amount of silkworm pupae produced by various silk filatures were not well utilized. In the first quarter of last year, Zhang Dingxian, a worker at the Suzhou No. 1 Silk Filature, created an extraction method for refining pupa oil. The pupa oil refined by this method, as proven by chemical testing, has special effects for silk refining in silk weaving factories and leather softening in leather factories, and can also be used as a raw material for making soap. Moreover, the silkworm pupae after oil extraction can still be used as fertilizer or feed. After the new silkworm pupa oil refining workshop in the Suzhou No. 1 Silk Filature and the silkworm pupa oil refining factory to be built in Wuxi are put into production, all the silkworm pupae produced by the silk filatures in Suzhou, Hushu Pass, and Wuxi can be refined into pupa oil. It is estimated that 12,330 jin of silkworm pupae can be refined daily. Based on an oil yield of 25 percent, 924,750 jin of pupa oil can be refined annually, increasing the country's wealth by 4 billion yuan. (Our Jiangsu Reporter Station)

### 把大量蚕蛹炼成蛹油

    把大量蚕蛹炼成蛹油
    江苏省人民政府工业厅最近在地方国营苏州第一缫丝厂内新添了一个提炼蚕蛹油的车间，并准备在无锡市新建一个提炼蚕蛹油工厂。
    江苏地区盛产蚕丝，过去各缫丝厂出产的大量蚕蛹都没有很好利用。去年第一季度，苏州第一缫丝厂工人张鼎贤曾创造了浸出提炼蛹油法。用这种方法提炼出来的蛹油，经化验证明，对织绸厂的炼绸与皮革厂的揉革有特殊功效，也可用作制造肥皂的原料。而且，提炼过油的蚕蛹，仍可用作肥料或饲料。江苏省工业厅在苏州第一缫丝厂内新添的一个提炼蚕蛹油的车间，和无锡市即将建设的提炼蚕蛹油的工厂投入生产后，就可以把苏州市、浒墅关、无锡市各缫丝厂生产出来的蚕蛹全部炼成蛹油，预计每天可炼蚕蛹一万二千三百三十斤，以百分之二十五的出油率计算，全年可炼蛹油九十二万四千七百五十斤，为国家增加四十亿元财富。（本报江苏记者站）
