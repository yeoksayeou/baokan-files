Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 23rd: The Japanese Diet reconvened on the 21st. On the 22nd, Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama and others delivered policy speeches. After a short period of questioning by the opposition parties on the government's policies, the Diet will then announce its dissolution, with a general election to be held within forty days of the dissolution.

	Ichiro Hatoyama and Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu's speeches uniformly emphasized that the main problem facing Japan today is to achieve independence and autonomy. However, the policies they put forward were to "enhance close cooperation with the United States," implement rearmament, and revise the constitution that prohibits rearmament. Ichiro Hatoyama said he intends to establish a supra-partisan body in the Diet to draft constitutional amendments.

	Mamoru Shigemitsu, in his foreign policy speech, emphasized that "cooperation" with the United States is the basis of Japan's foreign policy. Regarding the issue of restoring normal relations with China and the Soviet Union, which the Hatoyama government has frequently discussed since its formation, Shigemitsu said that it is "extremely unreasonable and abnormal" that a state of war still exists between Japan and China and the Soviet Union ten years after the end of the war. However, he said that Japan should restore normal relations with China only by "waiting for changes in the international situation, there is no other way." He said that promoting trade with China is necessary for the Japanese people, but this trade should be conducted within the scope of "not violating Japan's international obligations."

	Finance Minister Hisato Ichimanda's economic policy speech emphasized the need to strengthen Japan's export competitiveness and improve the balance of international payments. He said that therefore, the government will strengthen the "rationalization" of basic industries.

	Japanese opposition parties commented on these policy speeches by the Hatoyama government. Secretary-General Inejiro Asanuma of the right-wing Socialist Party said that these speeches "vaguely stated past claims on the issue of adjusting diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union. Regarding the issue of revising the constitution, it wants to pass the responsibility to the Diet. The economic policy is also all things to all people." Secretary-General Hiroo Wada of the left-wing Socialist Party said that in these speeches, "the issue of adjusting Japan's diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union, which has become one of the banners of the Hatoyama Cabinet, cannot be seen either."

    日本国会即将解散并准备大选
    【新华社二十三日讯】东京消息：日本国会在二十一日复会。二十二日，首相鸠山一郎等发表了政府的政策演说。在在野党对政府的政策进行短时间的质询后，国会将接着宣告解散，在解散后的四十天内举行大选。
    鸠山一郎和外务相重光葵的演说一致强调日本当前的主要问题是要达到独立自主。但是，他们所提出的政策却是“增进和美国的密切的合作关系”，实行重新武装，并修改禁止重新武装的宪法。鸠山一郎说：他打算在国会里设立一个超党派的机构，草拟宪法修改案。
    重光葵在他的外交政策演说中强调同美国“合作”是日本外交政策的基础。关于鸠山政府在它成立以来经常谈到的和中、苏恢复正常关系问题，重光葵说：在战争结束十年后的今天，日本和中国、苏联之间还存在着战争状态是“极端不合理和不正常的”。但是他说：日本要和中国恢复正常关系，“只有等待国际形势发生变化，没有别的办法”。他说：促进和中国的贸易对日本人民是必要的，但是这种贸易应在“不违反日本的国际义务”的范围内进行。
    藏相一万田尚登的经济政策演说强调要加强日本的出口竞争力量，改善国际收支的平衡。他说，因此政府将加强基本产业的“合理化”。
    日本各在野党派对鸠山政府的这些政策演说发表了评论。右派社会党总书记浅治稻次郎说：这些演说“在同中苏调整邦交的问题上，对过去的主张含混其辞。对修改宪法问题，则想把责任推给国会。经济政策也是八面玲珑”。左派社会党总书记和田博雄说：在这些演说中，“成为鸠山内阁的旗帜之一的调整日本同中苏两国的邦交问题也看不到了”。
