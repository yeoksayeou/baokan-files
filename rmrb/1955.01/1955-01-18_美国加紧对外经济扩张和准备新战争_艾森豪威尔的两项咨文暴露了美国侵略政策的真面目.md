    Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Washington: U.S. President Eisenhower submitted a message to the U.S. Congress on January 10 regarding foreign economic policy.
    In his message, Eisenhower, as usual, sang a high-pitched tune of "reciprocal trade relations." For a long time, the United States has been building high tariff barriers to resist the import of foreign goods, while at the same time intensifying its penetration into the economies of its "allies" and their colonies and demanding that other countries open their doors wide.
    Eisenhower acknowledged the existence of "many non-economic, artificial barriers" to international trade, but he completely avoided mentioning the "embargo" policy imposed by the United States on its allies, which is a trade barrier that seriously damages the interests of America’s "allies."
    Apparently aimed at easing the long-standing strong dissatisfaction of other capitalist countries with U.S. trade policies, Eisenhower requested an extension of his power to negotiate tariff reductions with other countries. However, he quickly stated that U.S. tariff reductions would only be "moderate" and would facilitate his "negotiations to reduce the barriers that now restrict the markets for our goods worldwide." Eisenhower clearly stated that even such a weakening would only be carried out "without exceeding the current danger points and exceptions." According to this clause, any domestic U.S. enterprise can request the cancellation of tariff reduction measures as long as it can prove that the established tariff has caused them losses.
    Eisenhower also mentioned simplifying U.S. customs procedures. He had to admit that the "cumbersome" nature of the current customs system "causes undue delays" in determining tariffs. These cumbersome procedures and delays have always been used to resist the import of foreign goods.
    Eisenhower's message particularly emphasized the need to increase private U.S. investment abroad (especially in underdeveloped regions). In order to facilitate the expansion of American monopoly capital abroad, he submitted a series of proposals to Congress, including: giving special preferential treatment to U.S. companies' subsidiaries or branches abroad in terms of income tax payments; using diplomatic pressure to "create a climate favorable to private enterprise investment." He also stated that he would continue to look for other ways to expand capital exports.
    Eisenhower also emphasized the importance of exporting U.S. agricultural products. He actually acknowledged the seriousness of the U.S. agricultural crisis, saying that a quarter to a third of certain major crops, such as wheat, cotton, and tobacco, must find markets abroad.
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Washington, January 16th: U.S. President Eisenhower submitted a message to Congress on the 13th regarding military personnel plans, which not only stipulated the maintenance of a large standing army, but also the implementation of universal military training for American youth to establish a huge so-called "National Reserve Force" to step up preparations for new wars.
    In his message, Eisenhower said that the United States must maintain a large military force for a long time. The message requested that the draft law, which expires on July 1 this year, be extended to 1959. This law authorizes the U.S. government to conscript American youth for two years of regular military service. The message also requested that another law expiring at the same time, regarding the conscription of doctors and dentists into the military, be extended to 1957. The message put forward a plan to establish a so-called "National Reserve Force." Eisenhower asked Congress to pass a bill stipulating that American youth aged seventeen to nineteen must "voluntarily" undergo six months of basic military training, and then be included in the reserve for nine and a half years. Eisenhower said that this reserve force would be quickly mobilized in wartime to support the regular army.
    Eisenhower bluntly said in his message that the United States "must be prepared" for "a world war" that the United States "will be involved in from the beginning." He did not mention the specific numbers of the regular army he requested to maintain and the reserve army he requested to establish, but only said that this would be a "military posture that the United States has not achieved in peacetime." Not long ago, Eisenhower announced in a letter to Secretary of Defense Wilson that the United States would maintain a standing force of approximately three million people this year. According to materials revealed by the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. newspapers, if the reserve army plan is passed in Congress, this reserve army will train five million people by 1959. A Reuters reporter reported that Eisenhower's message calling for American youth to receive military training and to conscript them into the army and reserve force "is unprecedented in peacetime." Ordinary people on the streets of the United States concentrated on the "pressure on almost every family" from the universal military training plan in the United States during peacetime in history. The reserve army plan proposed by Eisenhower is actually a disguised form of the universal military training bill previously proposed by the U.S. government. In 1952, strong opposition from the broad masses of the American people forced Congress to reject the universal military training bill proposed by the U.S. government. Now, the Eisenhower government is trying to impose an old plan with a changed face on the American people. Because many professional soldiers in the U.S. military are unwilling to stay in the army and have resigned one after another, Eisenhower also submitted another message to Congress on the 13th, requesting an increase in the salaries of professional soldiers. He hoped that this would keep more people in the army.

### 美国加紧对外经济扩张和准备新战争  艾森豪威尔的两项咨文暴露了美国侵略政策的真面目

    美国加紧对外经济扩张和准备新战争
    艾森豪威尔的两项咨文暴露了美国侵略政策的真面目
    【新华社讯】华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔一月十日向美国国会提出对外经济政策咨文。
    艾森豪威尔在咨文中照例大唱“互惠贸易关系”的高调。许久以来，美国一方面高筑本国关税壁垒来抵制外国货物入口，另一方面自己却加紧渗入它的“盟国”及其殖民地的经济并且要求其他国家大开门户。
    艾森豪威尔承认国际贸易存在着“许多非经济的、人为的障碍”，但他却完全避而不提到美国强迫它的盟国接受的“禁运”政策，而这正是严重损害了美国的“盟国”利益的贸易障碍。
    显然是着眼于缓和其他资本主义国家长久以来对美国贸易政策的强烈不满，艾森豪威尔要求延长他和其他国家谈判削减关税的权力，但是他赶紧表明美国关税的削减将只是“适度的”削减，并且为的是便于他来“谈判减少那些现在在全世界限制着我国货物的市场的障碍”。艾森豪威尔明白地表明，即使是这样一种削弱也只是“在不逾越目前的危险点和例外条款规定的情况下”进行的。根据这个条款，美国任何国内的企业只要能证明既定的关税已对它们造成损失，就可以要求取消减低关税的措施。
    艾森豪威尔也谈了一些要简化美国关税手续的话，他不得不承认现在关税制度的“繁琐”在决定关税方面“造成了不应有的拖延”。这种繁琐的手续和拖延办法一直被利用来抵制外国货物的入口。
    艾森豪威尔在咨文中特别强调的是要增加美国私人在国外（特别是对落后地区）的投资。为了便利于美国垄断资本向国外扩张，他向国会提出了一系列的建议，这些建议包括：给美国公司在国外的附属公司或分公司在缴纳所得税方面以特殊的优待；运用外交上的压力，“创造一种有利于私人企业投资的气氛”。他还表示将继续寻找其他办法来扩大资本输出。
    艾森豪威尔还强调输出美国农产品的重要性。他实际上承认了美国农业危机的严重，他说，某些主要农作物如小麦、棉花和烟草等，有四分之一到三分之一的数量必须在国外找市场。【新华社十六日讯】华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔十三日向国会提出了关于军事人员计划的咨文，不仅规定维持一支庞大的常备军队，而且要对美国青年实施普遍军训，以建立起一支庞大的所谓“国民后备军”，来加紧准备新的战争。艾森豪威尔在咨文中说，美国要长期保持一支庞大的军事部队。咨文中要求把到今年七月一日期满的征兵法延长到一九五九年，这个法律授权美国政府征召美国青年服两年常规兵役。咨文中并要求把另一项同时期满的关于征召医生和牙医生到军队服务的法律延长到一九五七年。咨文中提出了建立所谓“国民后备军”的计划。艾森豪威尔要求国会通过一个法案，规定美国十七岁到十九岁的青年都要“自愿”受六个月的基本军事训练，然后在九年半时间内一直列入后备役。艾森豪威尔说，这支后备军在战争时就要迅速动员起来，支援常规军队。艾森豪威尔在咨文中露骨地说，美国“必须准备”“美国一开始就要卷入的”“世界战争”。他在咨文中没有谈到他要求维持的常规军和建立的后备军的具体数字，他只是说，这将是美国“在和平时期没有达到过的军事态势”。不久以前，艾森豪威尔在他给国防部长威尔逊的信中曾宣布，美国在今年要把武装部队的现役人力保持约三百万人。据美国国防部和美国报刊透露的材料，如果后备军计划在国会通过，到一九五九年为止，这种后备军将训练五百万人。路透社记者在报道艾森豪威尔的咨文时说，艾森豪威尔要求美国青年受军训和征召他们参加军队和后备队，“这种要求在和平时期是没有先例的”。美国街头上的老百姓注意集中在美国历史上和平时期的普遍军训计划“对几乎每一个家庭的压力”。艾森豪威尔提出的后备军计划，实际上就是美国政府过去提出的普遍军训法案的变相。在一九五二年，美国广大人民的强烈反对曾迫使国会否决过美国政府提出的普遍军训法案。现在，艾森豪威尔政府又企图把改头换面的老计划强加在美国人民身上。由于美国许多职业军人不愿再留在军队中而纷纷辞职，艾森豪威尔十三日还向国会提出了另一个咨文，要求增加职业军人的薪饷。他希望，这样使更多的人留在军队里。
