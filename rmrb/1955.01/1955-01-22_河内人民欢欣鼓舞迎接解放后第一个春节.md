Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 21st: The people of Hanoi are joyfully welcoming their first Spring Festival since liberation. These days, state-owned department stores and private shops are crowded with people buying goods for the festival.

The picturesque and evergreen city of Hanoi has returned to the embrace of the Vietnamese people for more than three months. During these days, Hanoi is undergoing tremendous changes under the administration of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The marks of the colonial economy are being erased. Factories and workshops, which were suffocated by goods from France and other countries before liberation, have now been developed. By the end of last December, 134 factories and workshops had applied to start or expand their operations. Thanks to the planned purchasing policy implemented by state-owned trading companies, all eleven rubber shoe workshops, which had closed down before liberation due to the lack of sales for their products, have now resumed operations, and some are even planning to expand. Near the railway station and along the Red River bank, sawmills are busily supplying various kinds of wood panels to construction sites and schools. The supply of Hanoi cigarettes, which used to be entirely dependent on imports or shipments from Saigon, is now being met by twenty-three cigarette workshops that have started operations. To meet the needs of the vast rural areas, the number of glass factories has also increased from four to eight.

The commerce of Hanoi is also becoming increasingly active due to the smooth exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. The desolate scene at the Red River pier before liberation has completely changed. Now, more than a hundred motorboats and wooden boats gather and disperse at the Red River pier every day, transporting various supplies for rural areas to Thanh Hoa, Nam Dinh, Ninh Binh, and various parts of Viet Bac. Thanks to the vigorous supply from state-owned trading organizations, the prices of daily necessities such as gauze, kerosene, and sugar in Hanoi have remained stable.

The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is systematically addressing the various social problems left over from colonial rule. With the help of the government, more than a thousand unemployed workers and urban poor have found jobs. Incidents of drunkenness, beatings, and robberies that used to occur frequently on the streets are now rare.

The residents of Hanoi are welcoming their new life after liberation with joy. On New Year's Day this year, more than 200,000 people participated in the ceremony celebrating President Ho and the government's return to the capital, or listened to the live broadcast of the ceremony. Tens of thousands of people watched many performances of the National Music and Drama Festival in the newly built open-air People's Theater, which can accommodate 7,000 people.

Every Sunday or holiday, a continuous stream of people flocks to the newly opened People's Bookstore to buy the works of President Ho, Comrade Truong Chinh, and books from the Soviet Union and China. The lush green parks also attract many holiday visitors. Every Sunday, one can see groups of children playing various games and dancing in the park.

The people of Hanoi have demonstrated their will to defend their new life and strive for national reunification with their actions. Since last November, 60,000 people have gathered to protest against the American aggression in South Vietnam and the violations of the armistice agreement by the French colonialists and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique.

    河内人民欢欣鼓舞迎接解放后第一个春节
    【新华社河内二十一日电】河内人民正在欢乐地迎接解放以后的第一个春节。这些日子里，国营百货公司和私人商店里拥挤着购买过节用品的人群。
    风光绮丽、四季常青的河内市回到越南人民的怀抱里已经三个多月。这些日子河内在越南民主共和国政府管理下正在发生着巨大的变化。殖民地经济的烙痕正在消除。解放前被法国和其他国家商品压得喘不过气的工厂作坊已经获得了发展。去年十二月底，已经有一百三十四家工厂、作坊申请开工或者扩大经营。由于国营贸易公司实行有计划的收购政策，解放前由于产品没有销路而纷纷歇业的制胶鞋作坊，现在已有十一家全部开工，有的还准备扩大。在火车站附近和在红河岸旁，锯木厂每天忙碌地把各种木板供给正在进行建设的工地和学校。河内纸烟的供应，过去完全依赖进口或从西贡运来，现在已有二十三家卷烟作坊开工。为了满足广大农村的需要，玻璃厂也已从四家增加到八家。
    河内市的商业也由于城乡物资交流的畅通而日趋活跃。解放前红河码头渡口的那种冷冷清清的情况，已经完全改观了。现在，每天有百余只汽船、木船在红河的码头渡口集散，把各种供应农村的用品运到清化、南定、宁平和越北各地。由于国营贸易机关的大力供应，河内的纱布、火油、糖等日用品的价格一直保持稳定。
    越南民主共和国政府正在有步骤地着手解决殖民地统治遗留下来的种种社会问题。在政府的帮助下，已有一千多个失业工人和城市贫民找到了工作。原来在街道上不断发生的酗酒、殴打和抢劫的事件现在已经罕见了。
    河内居民怀着欢欣的心情迎接他们解放后的新生活。在今年元旦，有二十余万人参加了庆祝胡主席和政府还都的典礼，或者听了这次典礼的实况广播。数万人在新修的可容七千人的露天人民剧场，先后看了全国音乐、戏剧会演的许多演出。
    每到星期天或假日，川流不息的人群涌向新开设的人民书店，购买胡主席、长征同志的著作和苏联、中国的书籍。绿草如茵的公园也吸引着很多假日的游客。每到星期日，人们就可以看到成群的少年儿童在公园里作着种种游戏和舞蹈。
    河内人民用自己的行动表现了保卫新生活和争取祖国统一的意志。从去年十一月以来，已经有六万人先后集会，抗议美国在南越的侵略行动和法国殖民分子、吴庭艳集团违反停战协定的行为。
