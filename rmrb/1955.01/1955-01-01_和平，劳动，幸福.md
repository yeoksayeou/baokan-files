    Peace, Labor, Happiness
    Du Gebining, Worker of the Soviet "Red Viborg" Factory, Stalin Prize Winner
    It is both easy and difficult to talk about the past year. It's easy because there were many events last year; on the other hand, it's difficult because I have to choose the most meaningful and characteristic events.

    Let me start with the most important thing—my participation in the movement to strive for peace. As a member of the Soviet Peace Committee, last year I participated in many meetings held in Leningrad and other cities in our country. At these meetings, I talked about the achievements of the world peace movement and my impressions as a fortunate participant in the Vienna Peace Congress.

    In the past year, I have received many letters from abroad: from Poland, Czechoslovakia, China, and even Japan. The people who wrote these letters, like me, are ordinary workers, and like me, they love peace and need peace.

    As before, I continue to work as a marker in the "Red Viborg" factory in Leningrad. I am proud of this job that I have been doing for almost thirty years. A few years ago, I won the Stalin Prize for improving labor methods. This year I will continue to study this aspect relentlessly. My goal is to further mechanize the labor of the markers and make our work more creative.

    Regarding the achievements that I and my comrades in this industry have achieved, I have already talked about it in my report "Striving for Technical Progress" at the All-Soviet Conference of Production Innovators. This conference was convened by the Institute of Mechanical Engineering of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and it is also a brilliant example of the consolidated connection between Soviet scientific workers and producers.

    This is everything I want to emphasize about the past 1954. Now let me talk about my expectations for the coming year.

    First, let's talk about my daughter. My Inga will graduate from specialized school this spring and receive an engineering certificate. This is a major event in our family life. You know, my father was an ordinary worker, and I am an ordinary worker, but my daughter has received higher education.

    In the last few days of last year, I finished writing the booklet "My Experience as a Representative." In this book, I talked about what I should do as a representative of the Leningrad Oblast Soviet, and how I fulfilled the entrustment of the voters to me.

    My booklet will be published by the Moscow Legal Books Publishing Bureau, and a person like me who doesn't write much will consider this a very significant event in my life.

    和平，劳动，幸福
    苏联“红色维堡人”工厂工人  斯大林奖金获得者  杜·格必宁
    要谈谈过去的一年，是既容易也困难的。说容易，是因为去年有很多事件；另一方面又是困难的，因为必须挑选最有意义和最有特点的事件。
    让我先从最重要的——从我参加争取和平运动的事谈起吧。作为苏联拥护和平委员会的委员，去年，我参加了在列宁格勒和我国其他城市举行的很多会议，在这些会议上我讲了世界保卫和平运动的成就，谈了我作为维也纳保卫和平大会的幸运参加者对大会的印象。
    在过去一年中，我收到了很多外国的来信：从波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、中国、甚至日本的来信。写这些信的人和我一样，都是普通的劳动者，并且和我一样地热爱和平和需要和平。
    和从前一样，我继续在列宁格勒“红色维堡人”工厂中作标记工的工作。我对这个我已作了差不多三十年的工作感到自豪。几年以前，我由于改进劳动方法，获得了斯大林奖金。今年我要在这方面继续不屈不挠地进行钻研。我的目的是要使标记工的劳动更充分的机械化，使我们的工作更具有创造性。
    关于我和我们这一行的同志们所达到的成就，我已经在全苏生产革新者会议上我所作的“为争取技术进步而斗争”的报告中讲过了。这个会议是由苏联科学院机器制造研究所召开的，它也是苏联的科学工作者和生产者代表巩固联系的光辉范例。
    这就是我对过去的一九五四年所想强调说的一切。现在让我来谈谈对来临的这一年的期望。
    首先谈谈我的女儿。我的英嘉将在这个春天从专科学校毕业，得到工程师的证书。这是我们家庭生活中的大事。要知道我的父亲是一个普通工人，我也是一个普通的工人，而女儿却受到了高等教育。
    在去年的最后几天，我写完了“我的代表活动的经验”这本小册子。在这本书里我讲到了作为列宁格勒州苏维埃的代表我所应作的事，讲到了我怎样完成选民对我的委托。
    我的小册子将由莫斯科法律书籍出版局出版，而像我这样一个不大写作的人是会认为这是我生活中非常重大的事件的。
