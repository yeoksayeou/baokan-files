    Large Numbers of Outstanding Workers Join the Communist Party of China
    Many Students and Cadres of the Central Institute for Nationalities Recently Join the Party
   【Xinhua News Agency, 12th】 In 1954, Communist Party organizations in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenyang, as well as many industrial and mining areas, admitted a large number of outstanding workers into the Communist Party of China.
    From January to November of last year, more than 8,100 outstanding workers joined the Communist Party in state-owned factories and mines, construction sites, and joint state-private enterprises in Beijing. These included workers, engineers, technicians, medical workers, and management cadres. In state-owned and joint state-private factories in Shanghai, Party organizations admitted more than 11,800 outstanding workers into the Communist Party between January and September of last year. More than 10,000 workers in privately owned factories throughout the city joined the Communist Party, and Party organizations have now been established or have members in more than 1,800 privately owned factories that previously had no Party organizations. In Shenyang, Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, and other cities, as well as the Pingxiang Coal Mine, the Jixi Coal Mine, and cities in Jiangsu Province, tens of thousands of outstanding workers joined the Communist Party last year. In Tangshan, nearly 3,000 outstanding workers were admitted into the Party last year, with coal miners and steelworkers accounting for more than 66 percent. The number of workers who joined the Party in Jiangsu Province last year increased by 150 percent compared to 1953. Most of the workers who joined the Party in the Pingxiang Coal Mine were workers engaged in tunneling, coal mining, ventilation, and transportation in various mine shafts.
    Many of the outstanding workers who joined the Party last year were labor models, advanced producers, and leading figures in the technical innovation movement. Among the new Party members admitted in Tangshan last year, nearly 300 were labor models, including the well-known national labor model of the textile industry, the creator of the "Five Cleanliness Work Method" for fine yarn, and Li Fenglan, a female fine yarn worker at the joint state-private Tangshan Huaxin Textile Company. Zhao Dongbao, an old worker at the coke plant who joined the Party in Shijiazhuang last year, has always been active in production and has been selected as a labor model twice. On one occasion, he took the lead in repairing the small furnace flue at a high temperature of 800 degrees, preventing a major loss in production. Li Dechun, a model coal mining engineer in the Pingxiang Coal Mine who actively promoted Soviet advanced experience and greatly accelerated the speed of mine construction, and Meng Xianzhang, a model mechanical and electrical engineer who made significant contributions to the technical innovation movement, have also been admitted into the Party.
    The entry of these advanced workers into the Communist Party organizations has powerfully promoted the technical innovation movement and the campaign to increase production and practice economy in their respective factories and mines. Li Mingzhen, a female worker at the joint state-private Dasheng Textile Factory No. 1 in Nantong City, Jiangsu Province, actively studied technology before joining the Party, increasing the number of spindles she watched from 340 to 880. After receiving Party education, she often paid attention to passing on her skills to other workers, and now the spindle watching ability of the workers in her group has generally improved. Wang Yuzhen, a new Party member at the Beijing No. 1 Automobile Accessories Factory, worked diligently with the workers before and after joining the Party to improve and create eleven production tools, creating wealth worth more than 930 million yuan for the country. The production team he led continuously overfulfilled its production tasks in the three months from September to November last year.
    【Xinhua News Agency, 12th】 Sixty-four students and cadres of the Central Institute for Nationalities recently joined the Communist Party of China. Those admitted into the Party include members of twenty ethnic groups, including Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, Uygur, Miao, Yi, Zhuang, Buyi, Korean, Dong, Yao, Li, Minjia, Kazakh, and Oroqen. They are all outstanding individuals in their studies and work, and twenty-nine of them have been commended and rewarded by the institute for their hard work and active performance. Tang Shaoying, a Yao student, constantly maintains full political enthusiasm, overcomes difficulties in her studies, and is able to take the initiative to help others. Zhang Guosheng, a Tibetan student, is able to consciously rely on the organization and engage in ideological struggle in his practical work, constantly improving himself. Upon joining the Party, they unanimously expressed their determination to struggle to the end for the cause of communist construction in the motherland.

    大批优秀职工参加中国共产党
    中央民族学院许多学生和干部最近入党
   【新华社十二日讯】北京、上海、沈阳等城市和许多工矿地区的共产党组织，在一九五四年内吸收了大批优秀的职工加入中国共产党。
    北京市国营厂矿企业、建筑工地和公私合营企业中，从去年一月到十一月，有八千一百多名优秀职工参加了共产党，其中有工人、工程师、技术人员、医务工作者和管理工作干部。上海市国营和公私合营工厂中，党的组织在去年一月到九月间，接收了一万一千八百多名优秀职工加入共产党；在全市各私营工厂中参加共产党的工人有一万多名，原来没有党组织的一千八百多个私营工厂中，现在已建立起党的组织或有了党员。沈阳、唐山、石家庄等市和萍乡煤矿、鸡西煤矿及江苏省各城市，在去年内有数万优秀工人参加了共产党。唐山市在去年内接收了将近三千名优秀工人入党，其中煤矿工人和钢铁工人占百分之六十六以上。江苏省去年内入党的工人，比一九五三年增加了一倍半。萍乡煤矿入党的工人中，大部分是在各个矿井下担任掘进、采煤、通风和运输等工作的工人。
    去年入党的优秀职工，有许多是劳动模范、先进生产者和技术革新运动中的先进人物。唐山市去年接收的新党员中有近三百名是劳动模范，其中包括著名的全国纺织工业劳动模范、细纱“五洁工作法”的创造者、公私合营唐山华新纺织公司细纱女工李凤兰。石家庄市去年入党的焦厂老工人赵冬保，一贯生产积极，两次被选为劳动模范；有一次他曾带头冒八百度的高温修好了小炉烟道，使生产免受大的损失。萍乡煤矿中积极推广苏联先进经验、大大加快了矿井建设速度的模范采煤工程师李德纯，以及在技术革新运动中作出了重大贡献的模范机电工程师孟宪章都已被接收入党。
    这些先进工人加入共产党组织，有力地推动了所在厂矿企业的技术革新运动和增产节约运动。江苏省南通市公私合营大生纺织一厂女工李明珍，在入党前积极钻研技术，她看的纱锭从三百四十个提高到八百八十个；她接受党的教育，经常注意把自己的技术传授给其他工人，现在她组内工人的看锭能力已普遍提高了。北京第一汽车附件厂新党员王玉珍，在入党前后和工人一道刻苦钻研，改进和创造了十一件生产工具，为国家创造价值九亿三千多万元的财富。他领导的生产小组在去年九月到十一月三个月中，连续超额完成了生产任务。
    【新华社十二日讯】中央民族学院有六十四个学生和干部在最近加入了中国共产党。这些被接收入党的人中，包括有蒙、回、藏、维吾尔、苗、彝、僮、布依、朝鲜、侗、瑶、黎、民家、哈萨克、鄂伦春等二十个民族。他们都是在学习和工作中的优秀分子，其中有二十九人曾经因为学习努力和工作积极而立过功，受到学院的奖励和表扬。瑶族学生唐绍英经常保持着饱满的政治热情，克服学习中的困难，并能主动地帮助别人。藏族学生张国生能自觉地依靠组织，在实际工作中进行思想斗争，不断提高自己。他们在入党时一致表示要为祖国的共产主义建设事业奋斗到底。
