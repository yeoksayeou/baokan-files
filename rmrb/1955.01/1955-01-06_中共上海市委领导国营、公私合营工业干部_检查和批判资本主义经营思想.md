Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 4th: In the fourth quarter of 1954, the cadres of state-owned and some joint state-private industrial enterprises in Shanghai, under the leadership of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, launched a criticism and self-criticism campaign focusing on inspecting capitalist management ideology. This further promoted the adoption of various measures by factories to comprehensively fulfill state plans and achieved initial results.

Since the second half of 1953, most of Shanghai's state-owned factories and earlier joint state-private enterprises have achieved monthly completion of the total output value plan and output plan. However, many cadres did not pay enough attention to improving product quality and reducing costs. Some even resorted to improper methods at the end of the month, such as lowering product inspection standards, working overtime, increasing material input, wasting raw materials, or temporarily switching to producing products with high value, to unilaterally pursue the completion of total output value and output plans. Some factories even had false reporting and concealment. For example, the Shanghai No. 1 Pharmaceutical Factory, from a statistical point of view, had achieved monthly completion of total output value, profit delivery, and cost reduction plans. As a result, cadres developed complacency. After in-depth inspection, it was found that when they could not complete the total output value plan, they would switch to producing expensive medicines to make up for it, resulting in an accumulation of over 7 billion yuan worth of unsold medicines. The increase in profit delivery and the reduction in costs were false and did not deduct the factors of price changes.

In the fourth quarter, under the leadership of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, cadres of various factories launched criticism and self-criticism. Factories in heavy industry, textile industry, and light industry generally conducted "economic activity analysis," inspected the actual situation of their factories in completing various economic and technical indicators, and analyzed the reasons and key factors for failing to comprehensively complete the plans. They connected with reality to expose and criticize capitalist management ideology and complacency, and put forward various effective measures in management work. Cotton textile factories first focused on the problem of cotton consumption, which accounted for more than 75% of the cost, and found the key to saving raw cotton. Various measures were implemented in the cotton cleaning and carding departments. Most factories have now reduced the average cotton consumption per yarn to below 390 catties. In October and November, factories under the East China Textile Administration Bureau saved a total of 290,000 catties of raw cotton (the original plan was to save 150,000 catties in the fourth quarter), and the product quality generally maintained its original level. Currently, work is being further strengthened in improving product quality. In the economic activity analysis, light industrial factories revised backward or unrealistic planned targets and assigned the relevant indicators to workshops, organizing labor competitions. According to statistics from 49 factories, more than 34 billion yuan could be saved in the fourth quarter. The product quality of some factories has improved. Heavy industrial factories also generally carried out the work of assigning indicators to workshops, so that work sections and teams had their own goals of comprehensively completing various economic and technical indicators of their factories. In November, the labor productivity of the factories under the East China Iron and Steel Company increased by 7.94% compared with October, and the actual costs in October and November were reduced by 7.68% and 8.54% respectively compared with the annual planned targets. The Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 1, which had failed to complete the cost plan for the past ten months, comprehensively completed the plan for the first time in November. In machine factories, the emphasis was generally on inspecting new product production and product quality, criticizing the conservative and backward thinking of being content with the status quo, having insufficient understanding of the significance of trial-producing new products, and stopping at the level of repair and fitting industries, and putting forward measures in planning management, technical management, etc.

Factories that conscientiously inspected management ideology and implemented the system of assigning economic and technical indicators to workshops have begun to strengthen technical supervision and financial supervision, and promoted the implementation of operation plans and the establishment of responsibility systems. Many factories, in view of the loose quota management, blind material procurement, excessive reserves of work in progress, and unrealistic and irresponsible situations in drawing design, testing, and chemical testing, have strengthened the work of departments, promoted the planning of production technology preparation work, and established and strengthened management systems such as limited material requisition and return of surplus materials. The CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee also focused on the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant and the Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Plant to promote the system of holding "final accounts meetings" every month to check the implementation of the financial plan, commend units and individuals who implemented the plan well, and make improvements in response to shortcomings. The implementation of this system has initially achieved results.

    中共上海市委领导国营、公私合营工业干部
    检查和批判资本主义经营思想
    【新华社上海四日电】一九五四年第四季度，中共上海市委员会领导国营和部分公私合营工业的干部，展开以检查资本主义经营思想为主要内容的批评和自我批评，使各厂在全面完成国家计划方面进一步采取了各种措施，并取得初步成绩。
    上海国营工厂和公私合营较早的工厂，一九五三年下半年以来多数已做到按月完成生产总值计划和产量计划，但不少干部对产品质量的提高和成本的降低却不重视。有的甚至往往在月终时采取降低产品检验标准，加班加点，增加投料，浪费原材料或临时换产价值高的产品等等不正当的方法，片面追求生产总值和产量计划的完成。部分工厂甚至还有虚报、隐瞒的现象。例如：国营上海第一制药厂，从统计数字上看，已做到按月完成生产总值、上缴利润、降低成本等计划，干部因此滋长了骄傲自满情绪。经深入检查后发现，他们在不能完成生产总值计划时，就换产贵重的药品来弥补，因此积压了七十多亿元的药品销不出去。上缴利润的增加和成本的降低是虚假的，并未扣除价格变动的因素。
    在第四季度，各厂干部在中共上海市委员会领导下展开了批评和自我批评。重工业、纺织工业和轻工业工厂较普遍的进行了“经济活动分析”，检查本厂完成各项经济、技术指标的实际情况，分析不能全面完成计划的原因和关键所在。联系实际对资本主义经营思想和骄傲自满情绪进行揭发和批判，并在经营管理工作上提出各种有效的措施。棉纺织工厂首先着重抓住占成本百分之七十五以上的用棉量问题，找出节约原棉的关键，在清花和梳棉部门，实行各种措施。大部分厂每件纱的平均用棉量现在已降到三百九十斤以下，十和十一两月华东纺织管理局所属厂共节约了二十九万斤原棉（原计划第四季度节约十五万斤），产品质量一般都保持原有水平。目前，正进一步在提高产品质量方面加强工作。轻工业工厂在经济活动分析中，修改了落后或不切实际的计划指标，并将有关指标下达到车间，组织劳动竞赛。据四十九个厂统计，第四季度可以节约三百四十多亿元。一部分厂的产品质量有了提高。重工业工厂也较普遍的进行了指标下达车间的工作，使工段、小组都有自己的全面完成本厂各项经济、技术指标的努力目标。华东钢铁公司所属各厂十一月份劳动生产率比十月份增长了百分之七点九四，十和十一月份的实际成本分别比年度的计划指标降低百分之七点六八和八点五四。去年十个月来都未完成成本计划的上海钢铁一厂，十一月份第一次全面完成了计划。在机械工厂中，一般都着重在新产品生产及产品质量方面进行检查，批判了安于现状、对试制新产品的意义认识不足、停止在修配工业水平的保守落后思想，并在计划管理，技术管理等方面提出措施。
    认真检查经营思想并推行了经济、技术指标下车间制度的工厂，都开始加强了技术监督和财务监督，推动了作业计划的实施和责任制的建立。不少厂针对定额管理松懈、盲目购料、在制品储备过多、图纸设计、试验、化验等工作中的不切实际、不负责任等等情况，加强了科室工作，推行了生产技术准备工作的计划化，建立并加强了限额领料、余料退回等等管理制度。中共上海市委员会并以上海机床厂、上海第一棉纺织厂为重点，推行每月召开“决算会议”的制度，检查财务计划的执行情况，表扬执行计划好的单位和个人，并针对缺点作出改进措施。这一制度的执行已经初步收到效果。
