We Will Increase National Edible Oil Production by 60 Million Jin This Year
Manager of the Zhongnan District Oil Company Wang Zhi

    The Zhongnan District Oil System recently held an advanced experience exchange meeting for the oil pressing industry in Liuzhou, Guangxi, and decided to increase the national production of edible vegetable oil by 60 million jin this year by improving the oil extraction rate.

    Is it possible to achieve this goal? Definitely, it is entirely possible. At present, the oil extraction rate in various parts of the Zhongnan District has not reached the average advanced indicators. At this meeting, representatives from various regions analyzed the possibility of increasing the oil extraction rate. The calculation results show that the regional average can be increased by 2.3 points. Using this indicator, based on the raw materials available for oil extraction in 1955, the region can increase vegetable oil production by more than 33,300 tons. This shows that the potential strength in the oil pressing industry is very large. The reason why it is possible to increase the oil extraction rate is also because there are many waste phenomena in the oil pressing process. For example, in Hunan and Hubei, peanuts are pressed with their shells, causing some of the oil to be absorbed by the dry shells. In Guangxi, peanuts are first shelled with a soil roller, but the pressure is too high, increasing the number of broken peanut kernels. On average, about 2% of the raw materials per hundred jin of shelled peanuts remain in the bran. Some units tried to squeeze the bran and found that they could still extract ten jin of oil from every hundred jin. In addition, situations such as scattering bran powder on the ground without cleaning it up, and rats stealing raw materials in the pressing room are also very common. If we overcome these wasteful phenomena, we can extract more oil. The potential strength is also reflected in the fact that the oil pressing industrial equipment in the Zhongnan District is relatively backward, with soil pressing accounting for more than 95% of the entire oil pressing industry. The residual oil in the raw cakes after these soil pressing workshops have finished pressing is still very high, with the highest being 19.3% and the lowest being 4.7%. As long as we make a little effort, it is entirely possible to reduce the residual oil rate and increase the oil extraction rate. Some soil pressing oil workshops have now carried out technical reforms and absorbed advanced experience, and the oil extraction rate has been improved. For example, the oil workshop in Liuzhou, Guangxi Province, after learning Li Chuanjiang's oil pressing principle, used the original soil pressing equipment to improve oil pressing technology and create a set of methods that increased the oil extraction rate of peanut kernels by 3.3% compared with the past; the sesame oil extraction rate increased by 3.83%. Other places such as Zhengzhou and Shangqiu in Henan, Fancheng and Yidu in Hubei, and Jinxian and Xingzi in Jiangxi have also made improvements in operating techniques, and the oil extraction rate has also been improved. If we promote these advanced experiences well, we can definitely tap a lot of potential.

    From the above situation, it is entirely possible for the entire region to complete the production increase plan of 60 million jin of edible oil. We are determined to strengthen political work, fully mobilize the masses, and with the support and assistance of the cooperative sector, actively improve oil pressing technology and promote advanced experience, and strive to achieve and exceed the goals set at this meeting, in order to meet the people's living requirements and support the country's industrial construction.

    我们今年要为国家增产六千万斤食油
    中南区油脂公司经理  王治
    中南区油脂系统最近在广西柳州召开了榨油工业先进经验交流会，确定要在今年内用提高出油率的办法，为国家增产六千万斤食用植物油。
    达到这个目标，是不是可能呢？肯定地说，是完全可能的。目前中南区各地的出油率一般都没有达到平均先进指标，这次会议上各地代表分析了提高出油率的可能性，计算结果，全区平均可以提高出油率二点三。用这个指标，按一九五五年可供榨油的原料核算，全区可以增产植物油三万三千三百多吨。这说明榨油业中的潜在力量是非常大的。提高出油率之所以可能，还因为目前榨油过程中存在着很多浪费现象。如湖南、湖北榨花生都是带壳榨，使部分油脂被干壳吸去。广西榨花生先用土砻去壳，压力太大，使花生仁的破碎粒增加，平均每百斤带壳花生约有百分之二的原料遗留在尾糠里。有的单位曾把尾糠拿来试榨，发现每一百斤里还可以榨出十斤油来。此外，像场地上抛散麸粉，没有打扫干净；榨房里老鼠偷吃原料等情况，也是很普遍的。如果我们克服了这些浪费现象，就可以榨出更多的油来。潜在力量还表现在：中南区的榨油工业设备比较落后，全部榨油业中土榨占百分之九十五以上。这些土榨作坊榨完油以后的生饼中残留的油还很多，最高的有百分之十九点三，最低的也有百分之四点七。只要稍加努力，降低残油率和提高出油率是完全可能的。现在有些土榨油坊进行了技术改革，吸收了先进经验，出油率已经有所提高。如广西省柳州的油坊在学习李川江的榨油原理后，利用原有土榨设备，改进榨油技术，创造了一套方法，使花生仁出油率比过去提高了百分之三点三；芝麻出油率提高了百分之三点八三。其他如河南的郑州、商邱，湖北的樊城、宜都和江西的进贤、星子等地在操作技术上都有改进，出油率也都提高了。如果我们很好地推广这些先进经验，一定还可以挖掘出不少潜力来。
  从以上的情况看来，全区完成六千万斤食用油的增产计划是完全可能的。我们决心加强政治工作，充分发动群众，在合作社部门的支持与协助下，积极改进榨油技术和推广先进经验，争取实现和超过这次会议上提出的奋斗目标，以满足人民的生活要求和支援国家的工业建设。
