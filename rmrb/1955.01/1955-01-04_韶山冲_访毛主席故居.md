    Shaoshan Chong
    ——A Visit to Chairman Mao’s Former Residence
    Yan Chen
    I walked past one mountain ridge after another, and deep within the mountains lies an ancient village. Verdant bamboo forests conceal it, and an endless stream of admiring people walk along the main road. The mud walls are blackened by the smoke from firewood, and wild grass grows in the tile ridges. It was in this simple little earthen house that a great man was born. The two clear ponds in front of the house resemble a pair of kind and wise eyes, reflecting the suffering of the people and shining with the confidence to create a better world. In the valley behind the house, the morning dew once dampened small, bare feet, and countless sweat drops and footprints marked the terraced fields, layer upon layer. Near the short window, leaning over the faded eight-immortal table, countless days and evenings were diligently spent. The fresh breeze opened a wise mind, and I seemed to hear the sound of朗朗reading aloud. In the square fire pit in the kitchen, the ashes of茅柴burning years ago still remain. The mud teapot hanging from the beam gurgled, and the light of 松明pine torches illuminated every passionate heart. A 牛篦子ox comb, a textbook, all gave me infinite solemn enlightenment. A 碓屋rice hulling house, a 晒谷坪grain drying ground, were all filled with sincerity and simplicity. Everything here is so ordinary, but isn’t the greatest also the most simple? Standing in the wind and rain of thirty years, the azaleas in front of and behind the mountain bloom ever more luxuriantly.
            November 1954, on the banks of the Xiangjiang River

    韶山冲
    ——访毛主席故居
    严辰走过一道山岭又一道山岭，深山环抱里有个古老的山村，青青的竹林掩盖着它，大路上走不完瞻仰的人群。泥墙被柴烟薰得漆黑，瓦楞里有野草丛生，就在这简单的小土屋里，却诞生了一个伟大的人。屋前那两口清水池塘，仿佛一双慈祥明智的眼睛，它照映着人民的苦难，闪耀着创造美好世界的信心。屋后的山谷里，早晨的露水，打湿过小小的赤裸的脚板，那一层一层的梯田里，曾滴落多少汗珠，踏遍多少足印。靠近短窗，伏在褪色的八仙桌上，曾勤奋地度过无数的白天和黄昏，清新的风吹开了智慧的心灵，我仿佛听到朗朗的读书的声音。在厨房的四方形的火坑里，还留着当年茅柴的灰烬，梁上挂起的泥茶炊嘟嘟直响，松明的光亮映红了一颗颗火热的心。一个牛篦子，一本教科书，都给了我无限庄严的启示，一间碓屋，一片晒谷坪，都充满了诚恳、淳朴的气氛。这里的一切是如此平凡，可是，最伟大的不也最单纯？站在三十年的风雨里面，山前山后的映山红愈开愈茂盛。
