Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 28th: The United Nations Advisory Committee, preparing for the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, continues to meet to discuss the rules of procedure for the international conference. The press has learned that some representatives on the Advisory Committee, particularly the American representatives, intend to force a set of peculiar rules of procedure on the future conference. For example, the suggestion made by the Soviet representative that the rules of procedure drafted by the Advisory Committee must be submitted to the future international conference for approval was not accepted.

It is reported that the committee is now discussing the rules regarding the submission of reports to the international conference. It is noteworthy that representatives of some Western countries are apparently very concerned that the issues discussed at the conference might go beyond the scope of what the Western countries want to limit the conference to. Therefore, representatives of Western countries have put forward amendments to the rules, intending to prevent or constrain the above possibility as much as possible.

It is reported that the representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom advocate presenting the topics and texts of the reports as late as possible, which cannot but make it difficult for the international conference to conduct effective work.

    联合国谘询委员会继续开会
    讨论国际会议的议事规则
    【新华社二十九日讯】　塔斯社纽约二十八日讯：筹备和平利用原子能国际会议的联合国谘询委员会继续开会，讨论国际会议的议事规则。新闻界获悉，谘询委员会中有些代表、特别是美国代表打算硬给未来的会议制订一套奇异的议事规则。例如，苏联代表提出的关于必须把谘询委员会所拟订的议事规则提交未来的国际会议通过的建议就没有被接受。
    据报道，现在委员会在讨论关于向国际会议提出报告的规则。值得注意的是，有些西方国家的代表显然非常担心会议上所讨论的问题将可能超出西方国家想要限制会议讨论的范围之外。因此，西方国家代表提出他们对规则的修正案，打算来杜绝或是尽可能约束上述可能性。
    据报道，美国和英国代表主张尽可能迟地提出报告的题目和报告的本文，而这样就不能不使国际会议进行有成效的工作发生困难。
