The Ministry of Forestry recently held the first National Forestry Survey and Design Model Worker Representative Conference to exchange advanced experiences and conduct labor emulation drives to select model workers.

Last year, over ten thousand forestry survey and design personnel in our country launched a labor emulation drive in high mountains and steep hills to investigate the country's forest resources. This competition improved the labor enthusiasm of survey and design personnel, encouraged forestry surveyors to use their brains, overcome numerous difficulties in forest areas, improve survey methods and tools, improve labor organization, and implement planned management, greatly increasing labor productivity. For example, the workload of forest class lines in the first and second survey teams directly under the Survey and Design Bureau of the Ministry of Forestry increased two to three times in the later stage of the competition compared to the early stage. The workload of the afforestation survey team increased four to five times. The quality of work has also been greatly improved. In the competition, the political and ideological consciousness of the personnel of each survey team was raised, and some people who were uneasy about working in forest areas also realized the importance of their work and became active. Last year, a total of 274 labor models and 25 model units emerged. They have become good examples for leading the vast number of employees to complete forest survey and design tasks.

At the meeting, the representatives exchanged advanced experiences, discussed the summary report of the labor emulation drive, and put forward plans and guarantees for taking the lead in launching the labor emulation drive this year.

The meeting selected twelve National Forestry Survey and Design Labor Models and seven Labor Model Units. Liu Tiankui, a first-class labor model, was not afraid of hardship and found a shortcut that enabled the completion of the material transportation task forty days ahead of schedule, saving the state more than 230 million yuan. Wei Guoming, a first-class labor model, diligently studied his work, improved labor organization, and increased work efficiency by 62% and tree measurement quotas by 57%. Dafujin Zhendou, who enthusiastically served the survey personnel and the masses in the forest area, was also awarded the title of first-class labor model.

    评选林业调查设计劳动模范
    林业部最近召开首届全国林业调查设计劳动模范代表大会，交流先进经验，深入开展劳动竞赛评选劳动模范。
    去年我国有上万的林业调查设计人员，在高山峻岭中为调查祖国森林资源开展了劳动竞赛。这一竞赛提高了调查设计人员的劳动积极性，鼓舞林业调查人员开动脑筋，克服林区重重困难，改进了调查方法，调查工具，改进了劳动组织，实行了计划管理，使劳动生产率大大提高。如林业部调查设计局直属第一、二调查大队，竞赛后期林班线的工作量，比竞赛初期提高两、三倍。营林调查队工作线的工作量，提高了四、五倍。工作质量也大大提高。在竞赛中各调查队人员提高了政治思想觉悟，有些不安心林区工作的人也都认识了自己工作的重要性，转变得积极起来。去年共涌现出劳动模范二百七十四名，模范单位二十五个。他们已成为带动广大职工完成森林调查设计任务的好榜样。
    会上，代表们交流了先进经验，讨论了劳动竞赛总结报告，并提出了今年带头发起劳动竞赛的计划和保证条件。
      这次会议共评选出全国林业调查设计劳动模范十二名，劳动模范单位七个。一等劳动模范刘天奎，不怕艰险，找出了一条捷路，使物资运输任务提前四十天完成，给国家节约二亿三千多万元。一等劳动模范魏国明，认真钻研工作，改进了劳动组织，提高工作效率百分之六十二，提高测树定额百分之五十七。大夫金振都在林区热心为调查人员和群众服务，也获得了一等劳动模范的称号。
