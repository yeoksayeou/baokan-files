The report on the violations of labor discipline at the Wuhan Yuhua Yarn Factory and the Zhenjiang Hydropower Plant, which appeared in the People's Daily on December 20th last year, is of great educational significance to comrades in enterprise departments. The lessons from these two incidents are numerous. From the perspective of enterprise leadership, I think the following three issues deserve our special attention.

First, is the issue of strengthening ideological education on labor discipline for employees.

Constantly eliminating the influence of capitalist ideology among workers and raising their level of awareness is always the fundamental method for consolidating labor discipline. Because some behaviors of workers that violate labor discipline are, in essence, a concrete reflection of capitalist ideology eroding the ranks of the working class. Why did Li Haishan and Yu Baofa seriously violate labor discipline? Although there are many specific reasons, the most fundamental reason is that they lack communist consciousness. They treat labor in socialist enterprises with the same attitude they had towards labor in capitalist enterprises in the old society, regarding labor as a heavy burden, as a means of making a living when they have no other choice. They have not consciously unified their personal interests with the interests of the state, but have set them against each other. Thus, they seek enjoyment everywhere, evade labor, engage in passive slowdowns, and undermine systems, always wanting to take more from the state and do less themselves.

It can be seen from the Li Haishan and Yu Baofa incidents that the ideological education of employees in these two enterprises is very weak. The erroneous ideas of Li Haishan and Yu Baofa have hardly been effectively criticized for a long time, but have been allowed to grow and develop. This is where the danger lies.

The general situation in enterprises now is that labor discipline education has not become a regular and important part of political work, but is often neglected. In terms of educational content, there are also shortcomings of one-sidedness. For example, it is often said that the working class is the leading force of the country and the master of the enterprise; but the arduous responsibility of workers in national construction is rarely mentioned, or is mentioned very superficially. There is more publicity about advanced figures and deeds among employees (which is necessary), but little is done to expose the shortcomings of some employees and to carry out criticism and self-criticism through typical bad people and bad deeds, and to oppose bad tendencies. There is more publicity about how happy and beautiful life is in a socialist society, but little is said about the fact that a happy life can only be achieved through everyone's hard and honest labor. In terms of educational methods, there is more general publicity and mobilization work that does not distinguish between targets, and less self-education organized by the masses in conjunction with actual examples. Because regular education work is insufficient, a new moral atmosphere of "labor is glorious, evading labor is shameful" has not been universally established among employees, which cannot attract the majority of employees to consciously participate in the struggle to maintain labor discipline. The current poor labor discipline in some enterprises is clearly inseparable from this backward state of political and ideological work. In 1953, a labor discipline education campaign was carried out in industrial and mining enterprises across the country, which was welcomed by the majority of employees, and labor discipline was generally and significantly improved. This shows that as long as we are good at guiding and use appropriate methods to strengthen ideological education, labor discipline can be continuously consolidated.

The second issue is that in the work of consolidating labor discipline and strengthening the ideological education of employees, it is particularly necessary to strengthen the education and management of new workers and young workers.

In recent years, due to the rapid development of enterprise production, a large number of new workers have poured into and are continuing to pour into enterprises. These new workers come from all walks of life, and they maintain more or less contact with small-scale production or capitalist economy in society in their thinking and life, retaining various old habits that are not conducive to collective discipline. Among them, especially some young workers who have just entered the factory, because they have not undergone strict collective labor training, their labor concepts and labor habits are poor, they are greedy for pleasure, they wander around everywhere, and they cannot concentrate on production, so they often violate labor discipline. Some young workers, after learning some superficial skills, no longer humbly study, become arrogant and complacent, look down on veteran workers, look down on other workers, and are careless when operating, thus burying the seeds of accidents. The Yu Baofa incident is the most typical example. Since entering the factory, he has been addicted to eating, drinking and playing for a long time, he did not study production technology well, and he was unwilling to treat labor honestly, humbly and cautiously. In the end, he caused a serious accident, brought a terrible disaster to the enterprise, and was also sanctioned by the national law, from a worker to a criminal of the country. What a great lesson this is.

At present, the education and management of new workers and young workers in many enterprises is weak, so that they cannot get the progress they deserve in long-term collective life, do not know the discipline and system that must be observed for normal work, cannot master basic technical knowledge, and some incorrect tendencies cannot be discovered and corrected in time, resulting in continuous errors and violations of discipline.

The third issue is that at present, in consolidating labor discipline, it is particularly necessary to strengthen the technical discipline education of employees.

The most prominent and widespread problem of violating labor discipline in industrial and mining enterprises now is the failure to comply with technical operating discipline, that is, failure to operate in accordance with technical operating procedures and safety regulations, failure to construct according to drawings, etc. This directly causes a large number of quality accidents, equipment accidents and work-related injuries in enterprises, causing huge losses to the country, seriously hindering the development of enterprise production and the improvement of the quality of capital construction projects, and delaying the speed of national industrial construction. The direct cause of the serious accidents caused by Li Haishan and Yu Baofa this time was also the violation of technical operating procedures, which resulted in serious consequences that they themselves could not have imagined.

In the modern industry of machine production, strictly observing technical discipline and working meticulously in accordance with the prescribed operating methods and systems is the most important condition for ensuring the normal production of enterprises and the main content of enterprise labor discipline. However, in the past, many comrades in enterprise departments did not realize this. They limited labor discipline to a very narrow range of observing working hours and ensuring regular attendance, and abandoned this more important content. Thus, in their work, they only paid attention to whether employees went to work on time, whether there were absenteeism and absences (which is of course correct), but did not check the implementation of operating procedures and technical systems, did not educate workers and cadres to abide by technical discipline, and even believed that damage to machines or other accidents caused by non-compliance with procedures did not constitute a violation of labor discipline, and therefore did not take it seriously. In many enterprises, the attendance rate has increased day by day in recent years, and absenteeism has decreased, but the phenomenon of violating operating procedures has increased rather than decreased. This abnormal situation is clearly inseparable from the above-mentioned one-sided understanding, and we must vigorously correct it.

    三点教训
    施青
    去年十二月二十日人民日报上关于武汉裕华纱厂、镇江水电厂二件违反劳动纪律事件的报道，对企业部门的同志都有很大的教育意义。这二个事件给予我们的教训是很多的。从企业领导工作方面来看，我觉得下面三个问题，更是值得我们加以注意的。
    首先，是关于加强对职工的劳动纪律思想教育问题。
    不断地肃清工人中的资本主义思想影响，提高他们的觉悟程度，始终是巩固劳动纪律的根本方法。因为工人中违反劳动纪律的若干行为，就其本质来说，都是资本主义思想侵蚀工人阶级队伍的一种具体反映。李海山和郁宝发为什么会严重地违反劳动纪律的呢？具体原因固然很多，但是最根本的原因，就是他们缺乏共产主义的觉悟。他们以旧社会时在资本主义企业中对待劳动的眼光，来对待社会主义企业的劳动，把劳动视为沉重的负担，视为个人迫不得已时谋取生活的手段。他们没有自觉地把个人的利益同国家的利益统一起来，而是把它对立了起来。于是便处处追求享受，逃避劳动，消极怠工，破坏制度，总想从国家手里多拿一些，而自己少作一些。
    从李海山、郁宝发的事件中可以看出，这两个企业对职工的思想教育工作都是很薄弱的，李海山、郁宝发的错误思想几乎长期的没有受到过有力的批判，而是任其滋长发展。这就是危险的所在。
    现在企业中普遍的情况是劳动纪律教育没有成为政治工作的一项经常的重要内容，而是经常的被忽视。在教育内容上，也存在着片面性的缺点，如宣传工人阶级是国家的领导力量，企业的主人，讲得多；但工人在国家建设中的艰巨责任，却讲得少，或者很肤浅；宣扬职工中的先进人物和事迹较多（这是必要的），但是揭露职工中的某些缺点，通过典型的坏人坏事来开展批评和自我批评，反对不良倾向，却做得很少；宣传社会主义社会生活如何幸福美满，讲得多，但幸福生活要依靠大家艰苦诚实地劳动才能实现，却讲得很少。在教育方法上，是不分对象的一般地宣传鼓动工作多，结合实际典型组织群众进行自我教育做得少。由于经常的教育工作不够，在职工中没有普遍的树立起“劳动光荣，逃避劳动可耻”的新的道德风气，这就不能吸引广大职工自觉地来参加维护劳动纪律的斗争。目前企业中某些劳动纪律不好的情况，显然和政治思想工作的这种落后状况是不可分的。一九五三年全国各地工矿企业中，曾进行了一次劳动纪律的教育，受到了广大职工的欢迎，劳动纪律普遍地得到了显著改善，这就说明了：只要我们善于引导，并运用恰当的方式加强思想教育工作，劳动纪律是可以不断地得到巩固的。
    第二个问题是：在巩固劳动纪律加强职工思想教育的工作中，目前特别需要加强对新工人和青年工人的教育和管理。
    这几年来由于企业生产事业的迅速发展，企业中涌入了并正在继续涌入大量的新工人。这些新工人来自社会的各阶层，他们在思想上和生活上同社会上的小生产或资本主义经济，保持着或多或少的联系，保留着各种不利于集体纪律的旧习气。其中尤其是一些新入厂的青年工人，他们因为没有经过严格的集体劳动的锻炼，劳动观念和劳动习惯差，贪图玩乐，到处游荡，不能聚精会神地进行生产，因而经常地破坏劳动纪律。也有些青年工人，在学到一些粗浅的技术以后，就不再虚心学习，骄傲自满起来，看不起老师傅，看不起别的工人，操作时也就漫不经心，粗心大意，因而给事故埋下了祸根。郁宝发的事件就是个最典型的例子。他从进厂以来，长期醉心于吃喝玩乐，不好好学习生产技术，不肯老老实实地虚心谨慎地对待劳动，最后终于酿成了严重事故，给企业带来了奇灾大祸，自己也因此受到了国家法律的制裁，由一个工人而成了国家的罪犯。这是一个多么大的教训。
    现在，许多企业中对新工人和青年工人的教育管理工作是薄弱的，使得他们在长时期的集体生活中不能得到应有的进步，不知道进行正常工作所必须遵守的纪律和制度，不能掌握基本的技术知识，一些不正确的倾向，也不能得到及时的发现和纠正，结果就不断地发生错误和违反纪律。
    第三个问题是：目前在巩固劳动纪律中，特别须要加强对职工的技术纪律教育。
    工矿企业中现在违反劳动纪律最突出、最普遍的问题，就是不遵守技术操作纪律，即不按照技术操作规程和保安规程操作，不按照图纸施工等，它直接地造成了企业中大量的质量事故、设备事故和工伤事故，给国家造成了巨大的损失，严重地妨碍了企业生产的发展和基本建设工程质量的提高，延缓了国家工业建设的速度。这次李海山和郁宝发造成严重事故的直接原因，也都是因为违反了技术操作规程，结果发生了连他们自己也想像不到的严重后果。
    在机器生产的现代工业中，严格遵守技术纪律，一丝不苟地按照规定的操作方法和制度进行劳动，这是保证企业正常生产的最重要条件，是企业劳动纪律的主要内容。但是，过去许多企业部门的同志都没有认识到这一点，他们把劳动纪律仅仅局限在遵守上下班的作息时间、保证经常出勤的一个很狭小的范围里，而把这个更重要的内容抛弃了，于是他们在工作中就只是注意职工是否按时上班了，是否有旷工和缺勤（这当然是对的），却不去检查操作规程和技术制度的执行情况，不向工人和干部们进行遵守技术纪律的教育，甚至认为不按规程操作损坏了机器，或造成其他事故，不算是违反劳动纪律，因而也就不加严肃处理。不少企业中，近年来出勤率逐日提高了，旷工现象也减少了，但是违反操作规程的现象却有增无减，这种不正常的状况显然和上述片面认识是分不开的，我们必须大力加以纠正。
