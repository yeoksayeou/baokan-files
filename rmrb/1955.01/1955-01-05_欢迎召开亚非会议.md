    Welcome to the Asian-African Conference
    The Prime Ministers of Burma, Ceylon, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan held a meeting in Bogor, Indonesia, and issued a joint communiqué deciding to jointly initiate the convening of the Asian-African Conference in April 1955, inviting the People's Republic of China and twenty-four other countries to participate. The initiative to convene the Asian-African Conference has received widespread attention from fair-minded public opinion around the world, and the Chinese people express warm welcome and support for the convening of the Asian-African Conference.
    The convening of the Asian-African Conference is of historical significance. Such a conference is the first of its kind in history. As everyone knows, for a long time, most parts of Asia and Africa have suffered from the oppression and enslavement of the colonialist system, and the vast majority of our people in the two continents have been subjected to the disasters and threats of imperialist wars of aggression. For a long time, our voices have not been valued by others, and our wishes and demands have been ridiculed and suppressed by others. However, the situation is now different; countries and people in vast areas of Asia and Africa, accounting for more than half of the world's population, no longer allow others to manipulate their destiny. The situation in Asia has undergone fundamental changes, and the so-called "Dark Continent" of Africa has also dawned. Although the specific circumstances of countries in this region are different, and although the relations between some countries are obstructed by external forces, and there are still abnormal states, because the historical experience and practical requirements of the Asian and African people have many things in common, there are favorable conditions and foundations for everyone to discuss issues of common interest and contribute to maintaining peace. The convening of the Asian-African Conference profoundly reflects this important fact.
    The communiqué shows that the Prime Ministers of the five countries believe that the purposes of the Asian-African Conference are to promote friendly cooperation and good-neighborly relations between countries; to discuss the social, economic, and cultural issues and relations of the participating countries; to discuss issues related to national sovereignty, racism, and colonialism; and to discuss the status of Asian and African countries and their people in the world today, as well as the contributions they can make to promoting world peace and cooperation. In line with these purposes, the Prime Ministers of the five countries also expressed their hope that the Geneva Conference agreements would be fully respected and implemented by all parties concerned; supported Indonesia's demand for the recovery of West Irian and the struggle of the Tunisian and Moroccan people for independence and self-determination; and reaffirmed their serious concern about the destructive potential of atomic weapons explosions. Obviously, all this reflects the universal aspirations of the vast majority of the Asian and African countries and people, and peace-loving countries and people all over the world. We believe that striving for these goals is fully in line with the common interests of the Asian and African countries and people, and also in line with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.
    In the communiqué, the Prime Ministers of the five countries further pointed out that the basic purpose of the conference is to enable the countries concerned to better understand each other's views; the form of government and way of life of any country should not be interfered with by any other country. We believe that this proposition is legitimate. We believe that the fate of every country can only be arranged and decided by the people of that country. At the same time, we also believe that countries should achieve and maintain mutual understanding and respect. Based on this belief, we have always advocated that countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully. In this position, we do not exclude any country in the world. Based on this belief, we also believe that the Asian-African Conference should not become an exclusive regional group, but should strive to expand the peace zone and seek collective security.
    The Prime Ministers of the five countries also stated that their action to convene the Asian-African Conference does not imply any exclusive wishes on the part of the members of the conference. We support this statement. We believe that from this statement, the door of the Asian-African Conference is open to uninvited Asian and African countries.
    The Chinese people agree with the purposes of the Asian-African Conference agreed upon by the Prime Ministers of the five countries, and deeply believe that if the Asian and African countries work towards these purposes, it will greatly help to ease international tensions.
    For these purposes, many countries in Asia and Africa have made continuous struggles and done a lot of work. The vast majority of the people and many countries in Asia and Africa have frequently fought for national independence and against colonialist control. In Asia, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, China, and neutral countries such as India have made efforts to achieve and maintain the armistice in Korea. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Soviet Union, China, and many countries participating in the conference played an active role in promoting the Geneva Conference to reach an agreement, and the Colombo Conference countries also made great contributions. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by China and India, and China and Burma have had a wide impact, providing a good example for efforts to achieve peaceful cooperation. The preliminary negotiations between the Chinese delegation and the Indonesian delegation on the issue of dual nationality of overseas Chinese have yielded good results. The settlement of the issue of overseas Chinese nationality will set an example for other countries to solve the same problem. Mutual visits between many countries and people in Asia are increasing, and their friendly cooperation has also increased a lot. At the same time, through these visits, trade links and cultural exchanges between many countries in Asia are also increasing. All this is of great significance for striving for the national independence of Asian and African countries and expanding the peace zone, and for enhancing mutual understanding and economic development among the people of countries in this region. The Chinese people are willing to continue and expand these beneficial work with countries in the Asian and African region on the basis of the Five Principles, and work together to expand the peace zone.
    It should be particularly pointed out that the Soviet Union is a country located in both Europe and Asia. In order to promote peace in the Asian and African regions, and to support the national rights and economic development of the vast majority of people in this region, the Soviet Union has consistently made unremitting efforts in various aspects. In order to stop the Korean War and the Indochina War, and to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and ease tensions in the Far East, the Soviet Union has always actively struggled, never slacking. The joint declaration issued by the Soviet Union and China on October 12, 1954, also stated that China and the Soviet Union should build their relations with Asian countries and other countries on the basis of strict adherence to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, so as to open up broad possibilities for the development of international cooperation. From this, it can be seen that the Soviet Union's position on international relations is in line with the purposes of the Asian-African Conference.
    Peace-loving people all over the world welcome the convening of the Asian-African Conference, but the American aggressive group does not like the peaceful coexistence of the people of Asian and African countries, and it does not want to see the establishment and expansion of the peace zone. In order to attempt to obstruct the convening of the Asian-African Conference, the American aggressive group has slandered the motives for convening the Asian-African Conference. American officials also insisted, based on "reliable diplomatic signs," that the main countries in the Asian and African region were indifferent to the conference plan. They used various arguments to belittle the value of the Asian-African Conference, for fear that the conference would achieve something. Recently, the American aggressive group has been talking about its anti-colonialism and its desire for peace; however, the above facts cannot prove this statement, nor can they make people believe that it is not preparing for war.
    Now, people can see very clearly that there are two different attitudes regarding the issue of convening the Asian-African Conference: one is to actively support the convening of the Asian-African Conference in order to promote understanding and cooperation between Asian and African countries; the other is to try to obstruct the convening of the Asian-African Conference in order to facilitate creating opposition and division in the Asian and African region. This latter attitude is contrary to the wishes of the majority of countries and people in the Asian and African region, but the latter attitude currently adopted by the United States is obviously still having an impact on some countries that follow the United States.
    The majority of countries and people in the Asian and African region are increasingly aware that they must take their destiny into their own hands and demand peaceful cooperation with each other. The convening of the Asian-African Conference is timely and necessary. The Chinese people are willing to work together with the people of Asian and African countries to promote the convening of the Asian-African Conference.

### 欢迎召开亚非会议

    欢迎召开亚非会议
    缅甸、锡兰、印度、印度尼西亚和巴基斯坦的总理们在印度尼西亚的茂物举行了会议，并发表联合公报，决定联合发起在一九五五年四月召开亚非会议，邀请中华人民共和国和其他二十四国参加。召开亚非会议的倡议，得到了世界的公正舆论的广泛重视，中国人民对于召开亚非会议表示热烈的欢迎和支持。
    召开亚非会议具有历史性的意义。这样的会议在历史上还是第一次。人所共知，长期以来，亚洲和非洲绝大部分地区都遭受着殖民主义制度的压迫和奴役，我们两洲的绝大多数人民一直受到帝国主义侵略战争的灾害和威胁。长期以来，我们的声音不为别人所重视，我们的愿望和要求受到别人的侮弄和压制。但是，现在，情况已经不同了；占全世界人口一半以上的亚洲和非洲，已经有广大地区的国家和人民不再容许别人来摆布自己的命运了。亚洲局势已经发生了根本的变化，所谓“黑暗大陆”的非洲也已经破晓。尽管这一地区各国的具体情况不同，尽管有些国家之间的关系受到外来的阻挠，还存在着不正常的状态，可是，由于亚非人民的历史经验和现实要求有许多共同之点，因此，大家在一起讨论有关共同利益的问题，为维护和平贡献力量，已经有了有利的条件和基础。亚非会议的召开，就深刻地反映出这个重大的事实。
    公报表明，五国总理认为亚非会议的目的，在于促进各国间的友好合作和睦邻的关系；讨论与会各国的社会、经济与文化问题和关系；讨论有关民族主权的问题、种族主义和殖民主义的问题；讨论亚非国家和它们的人民今天在世界上的地位，以及它们对于促进世界和平与合作所能作出的贡献。本着这些目的，五国总理们还表示希望日内瓦会议的协议将受到所有有关方面的充分尊重和履行；支持印度尼西亚关于收回西伊里安的要求以及突尼斯和摩洛哥人民争取独立和自决权的斗争；同时重申他们对于原子武器爆炸的毁灭性潜力的严重关切。很显然，这一切都反映了亚非各国绝大多数人民和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的普遍愿望。我们认为，为这些目的而努力，将是完全符合亚非各国人民的共同利益，也符合于联合国宪章的宗旨和原则的。
    在公报里，五国总理们进一步指出会议的基本目的，是使有关的国家能够更好地了解彼此的见解；任何一国的政府形式和生活方式绝不应受到任何其他国家的干涉。我们认为这种主张是正当的。我们相信每一个国家的命运只能由那个国家自己的人民来安排和决定。同时我们也相信国家和国家之间应该取得和保持相互的了解和尊重。本着这种信念，我们一向主张不同社会制度的国家可以和平共处。在这个立场上我们并不排除世界上的任何国家。本着这种信念，我们也认为亚非会议不应该成为一个排他性的区域集团，而应该为扩大和平区域和谋求集体安全努力。
    五国总理并声明，他们想要召开亚非会议这一行动，并不是在会议的会员国方面抱着任何排他性的愿望。我们支持这个声明。我们认为从这个声明来看，亚非会议的大门对未被邀请的亚非国家是开着的。
    中国人民同意五国总理所协议的亚非会议的目的，并深信亚非国家如果本着这些目的而努力，将大大有助于和缓国际紧张局势。
    为了这些目的，亚非两洲许多国家作了不断的斗争，也作了不少工作。亚非两洲绝大多数人民和许多国家经常为谋求民族独立和反对殖民主义控制而奋斗。在亚洲，由于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中国和印度等中立国家的努力取得并保持了朝鲜的停战状态。为促成日内瓦会议达成协议，越南民主共和国、苏联、中国和参加会议的许多国家都起了积极的作用，科伦坡会议国家也作了很大的贡献。中印、中缅所倡导的和平共处的五项原则已经产生了广泛的影响，为争取和平合作的努力提供了良好的范例。中国代表团和印度尼西亚代表团关于侨民双重国籍问题的初步谈判产生了良好的结果。侨民国籍问题的解决，将为其他国家之间解决同样问题树立榜样。亚洲许多国家之间和人民之间的相互访问是越来越多了，他们之间的友好合作因之也增进了很多。同时，经过这些访问，亚洲很多国家之间的贸易联系和文化交流也越来越多了。所有这一切对于争取亚非各国的民族独立和扩大和平地区，对于增进这个地区各国人民之间的相互了解和经济发展都是有重大意义的。中国人民愿意在五项原则的基础上，同亚非地区国家继续并扩大这些有益的工作，共同为扩大和平地区而努力。
    特别应该指出，苏联是地居欧亚两洲的国家。为了促进亚非地区的和平，为了支持这个地区绝大多数人民的民族权利和经济发展，苏联一贯地从各方面作了不断的努力。为了停止朝鲜战争和印度支那战争，为了和平解决朝鲜问题并和缓远东紧张局势，苏联总是积极奋斗，从不稍懈。一九五四年十月十二日苏联和中国发表的联合宣言还表示：中苏两国要把它们同亚洲各国和其他国家的关系建立在严格遵守和平共处的五项原则的基础之上，这样来为发展国际合作开辟广泛的可能。从这里可以看出，苏联在国际关系上的立场是同亚非会议的目的相符合的。
    全世界爱好和平人民都欢迎亚非会议的召开，但是，美国侵略集团却不喜欢亚洲和非洲各国人民和平共处，它也不愿意看到和平地区的建立和扩大。为了企图阻挠亚非会议的召开，美国侵略集团曾经诽谤召开亚非会议的动机。美国官员并且根据
  “可靠的外交迹象”，硬要认为亚非地区的主要国家对会议计划表示冷淡。他们用各种说法来贬低亚非会议的价值，唯恐这个会议会有所成就。近来，美国侵略集团口口声声说它是反殖民主义的，它是要和平的；但是，上面的事实却不能证明这种说法，也不能使人相信它不是在准备战争。
    现在，人们看得很清楚，关于召开亚非会议的问题存在着两种不同的态度：一种是为了促进亚非国家的了解和合作而积极支持亚非会议的召开；另外一种是为了便于在亚非地区制造对立和分裂，力图阻挠亚非会议的召开。这后一种态度是违背亚非地区大多数国家和人民的愿望的，但是，美国目前所采取的这后一种态度，很显然，对于某些追随美国的国家还是在发生着影响。
    亚非地区大多数的国家和人民越来越认识到必须把自己的命运掌握在自己的手里，并要求相互之间的和平合作。亚非会议的召开是适时的、必要的。中国人民愿意和亚非各国人民一道为促成亚非会议的召开而共同努力。
