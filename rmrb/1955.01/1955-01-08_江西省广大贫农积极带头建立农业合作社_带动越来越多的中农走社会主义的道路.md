Xinhua News Agency Report:

    The broad masses of poor peasants in Jiangxi Province are actively taking the lead in participating in agricultural production cooperatives, and an increasing number of middle peasants are also joining.
    A new batch of agricultural production cooperatives is being established in rural Jiangxi Province. The broad masses of poor peasants have demonstrated a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm in the process of establishing these cooperatives. According to statistics from sixteen counties including Shangrao, Yiyang, Leping, and Wannian, more than 40,000 poor peasant households have joined agricultural production cooperatives in recent times. Many poor peasants, when joining the cooperatives themselves, also actively engaged in propaganda and networking activities to persuade hesitant farmers to join. In counties such as Shangrao, Poyang, Yongxin, and Ganxian, many poor peasants and some middle peasant activists adopted methods such as "relatives influencing relatives, neighbors influencing neighbors, confidants influencing confidants" to persuade many farmers who had concerns about joining agricultural production cooperatives. In the work of establishing cooperatives, poor peasants also took the lead in exposing the sabotage activities of some lawless rich peasants and other bad elements. Because the poor peasants took the lead in actively establishing cooperatives, they were often elected as cadres of the newly established cooperatives. Among the more than 40,000 poor peasant households who recently joined agricultural production cooperatives in the aforementioned sixteen counties of Shangrao, Yiyang, etc., more than 16,000 became the directors, deputy directors, or committee members of the various new cooperatives.

      Many middle peasants, seeing the fact that agricultural production cooperatives are "oriented well, have high yields, and increased income," have gradually dispelled their concerns and voluntarily applied to join the cooperatives under the leadership of the poor peasants. Recently, in only ten counties including Shangrao, Yushan, Hengfeng, Yiyang, Qianshan, and Guixi, and part of the Poyang Lake plain area, more than 14,000 middle peasant households joined agricultural production cooperatives, which is approximately fourteen times more than the total number of middle peasant households who joined cooperatives in the past two years. In the twenty agricultural production cooperatives that were established on a trial basis in Yugan County before the summer harvest of 1954, middle peasant members averaged less than 20 percent of the member households; recently, the number of agricultural production cooperatives in the county has grown to 138, and middle peasant members generally account for more than 25 percent of the member households. Many middle peasants in Wannian, Dongxiang, Guangfeng, Dexing, and other counties were originally unwilling to join cooperatives because they had a lot of land and complete sets of cattle and farm tools; however, after seeing that the original agricultural production cooperatives still achieved increased production despite the floods, they applied to join the cooperatives one after another. In the areas where the agricultural production cooperatives led by National People's Congress representatives Yi Ruisheng and Chen Yike and some other well-known agricultural production cooperatives are located, the vast majority of middle peasants have voluntarily joined the agricultural production cooperatives. Some middle peasants, because they resolutely take the socialist road and take the lead in establishing cooperatives together with the poor peasants, have also been elected as cadres of the agricultural production cooperatives by the members. Among the leaders of agricultural production cooperatives in Shangrao, Yushan, Fuliang, and other counties, approximately 15 percent are middle peasants. As the number of middle peasant households participating in agricultural production cooperatives increases, some basically collectivized villages have emerged in various parts of Jiangxi Province. According to statistics from Shangrao Prefecture at the end of November 1954, there were already forty-two such basically collectivized villages.

    江西省广大贫农积极带头建立农业合作社
    带动越来越多的中农走社会主义的道路
    据新华社讯：江西省广大贫农积极带头参加农业生产合作社，参加农业生产合作社的中农也逐渐增多起来。
    江西省农村中正在建立一批新的农业生产合作社。广大贫农在建社过程中表现了高度的革命积极性。据上饶、弋阳、乐平、万年等十六个县的统计，最近一个时期就有四万多户贫农参加了农业生产合作社。许多贫农在自己入社时，还积极进行宣传、串连等活动，说服那些犹豫不定的农民参加农业生产合作社。上饶、鄱阳、永新、赣县等县有许多贫农和部分中农积极分子一起，采用“亲串亲、邻串邻，知心人串知心人”等办法，说服了很多对参加农业生产合作社有顾虑的农民。在建社工作中，各地贫农还带头揭发了一些不法富农和其他坏分子的破坏活动。由于贫农带头积极建社，因而他们多被新办的社选为干部。上述上饶、弋阳等十六县最近参加农业生产合作社的四万多户贫农中，就有一万六千多人当了各个新社的正副社长或社务委员。
      许多中农由于看到农业生产合作社“方向好，产量高，收入增多”的事实，在贫农的带动下，逐渐解除顾虑，自愿申请入社。最近一个时期，仅上饶、玉山、横峰、弋阳、铅山、贵溪等十个县和鄱阳湖滨平原一部分地区，参加农业生产合作社的中农就有一万四千多户，比过去两年多内入社中农户数的总合大约增加了十四倍。余干县在一九五四年夏收以前试办的二十个农业生产合作社中，中农社员平均不到入社农户的百分之二十；最近一个时期，全县农业生产合作社发展到一百三十八个，中农社员一般都达到入社农户的百分之二十五以上。万年、东乡、广丰、德兴等县很多中农因为田多，耕牛、农具齐全，原来不愿意入社；但当他们看到原有的农业生产合作社在水灾侵袭下仍获得增产的事实后，便纷纷申请入社。在全国人民代表大会代表易瑞生、陈翊科所领导的农业生产合作社和其他一些较著名的农业生产合作社所在的地方，绝大部分中农都已自愿参加到农业生产合作社里来。有些中农由于坚决走社会主义道路，和贫农一起带头办社，还被社员们选为农业生产合作社的干部。在上饶、玉山、浮梁等县农业生产合作社的领导人员中间，大约有百分之十五左右是中农。由于参加农业生产合作社的中农户数越来越多，江西省各地已出现了一些基本上合作化了的乡村。上饶专区在一九五四年十一月底统计，这种基本上合作化了的乡村已有四十二个。
