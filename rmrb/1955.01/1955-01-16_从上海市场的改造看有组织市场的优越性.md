    The Superiority of Organized Markets as Seen from the Transformation of the Shanghai Market
    Zhang Jiachi

    Since the nation entered the period of planned economic construction, especially after the state implemented the system of unified purchase and sale of major commodities such as grain, oil, cotton, and cotton cloth, a new and significant change has taken place in Shanghai, the nation's largest commercial center: the rapid development of organized and planned markets and the gradual shrinking of blind, free markets.

    Since the state implemented the unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth in 1954 and continued to expand processing orders to private industries in Shanghai, it has gradually gained control over the supply of major industrial products produced in Shanghai. The Shanghai industrial products sold throughout the country are now basically supplied to all parts of the country by state-owned companies through internal allocation in a planned manner. Free market trade has been greatly reduced, and some has been completely replaced by organized and planned allocation. In the first quarter of 1954, the proportion of processing, ordering, unified purchase, exclusive sales, and purchasing in the total output value of Shanghai's large private industries was 86.67 percent, and by the third quarter, it had reached 91.79 percent. In 1953, more than 5.6 million bolts of cotton cloth produced in Shanghai were transported to other places by private merchants. In the first half of 1954, the amount transported by private merchants was reduced to more than 50,000 bolts. Since the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth in mid-September, the cotton cloth produced in Shanghai, the nation's largest textile industrial center, has been entirely supplied to meet the needs of the people throughout the country by the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation according to the state plan. Due to the state's implementation of the unified purchase of major agricultural products and vigorous development of the fuel industry, the large quantities of grain, fuel, and industrial raw materials needed by Shanghai's six million citizens and tens of thousands of factories have also been gradually imported and supplied by the state in a planned manner since 1954, and the inflow into the free market has gradually decreased, to the point of complete cessation.

    After the state gained control of major commodities in the Shanghai market, industrial raw materials and semi-finished products such as soybeans, peanuts, wheat, cotton, tobacco, cotton yarn, and grey cloth are basically no longer processed into finished products by factories through the free market, but are directly allocated by the state in a planned manner, or directly supplied to factories for production. State-owned companies concerned have also begun to directly supply users with fuel, chemical raw materials, hardware, and medical supplies. Most of the private retailers engaged in consumer goods have turned to state-owned companies for goods, and have begun to be incorporated into the state plan through varying degrees of socialist transformation. All 1,498 private rice stores in the city have been transformed into consignment stores of state-owned grain companies; consignment sales, distribution sales, or planned purchases have been implemented for more than 20,000 private retail stores dealing in cotton cloth, cooking oil, sugar, coal briquettes, cigarettes, rubber shoes, woolen yarn, paper, and general merchandise. These retail stores, under the supervision of employees, purchase goods from state-owned companies in a planned manner and sell them at state-owned company retail prices or unified prices. Commodities such as grain, cooking oil, and cotton cloth have been subject to rationed supply or designated supply points in accordance with state regulations.

    Due to the organized and planned exchange of materials between Shanghai and other places, and the organized and planned supply in the Shanghai sales market, the activities of merchants, trading groups, and brokers have been greatly reduced. From January to August 1954, 470 purchasing agencies established in Shanghai by private merchants from various places for cotton cloth, general merchandise, etc., have closed down. The business of the wholesale market is becoming increasingly slack. So far, eight wholesale markets and exchanges for rice, miscellaneous grain oil cakes, flour, coal, sugar, cotton cloth, woolen yarn, and silk have been approved for cancellation. The role of private wholesalers in commodity circulation is gradually disappearing.

    This new and significant change in the Shanghai market marks a new historical stage in the transformation of this largest and oldest capitalist speculative market in the country.

    Only five and a half years ago, Shanghai was still a huge speculative market of a semi-colonial and semi-feudal nature known as a "paradise for adventurers." At that time, it concentrated imperialist capitalists, bureaucratic comprador capitalists, and various other speculative capitalists with decades of speculative experience. They owned twenty-four wholesale markets and exchanges engaged in the buying and selling of gold and silver, foreign currency, and securities, engaging in speculation, hoarding, and organizing large-scale speculative activities. The entire market and people's lives were manipulated by them, and the impact spread throughout the country. After the liberation of Shanghai, the speculative forces of imperialism and bureaucratic capital were basically eliminated, but there were still many adventurers left who relied entirely on "snatching hats" and "kicking the ball" in the market for a living. Among the so-called "legitimate" industrial and commercial households, most had not abandoned speculative activities due to the long-term influence of the speculative market that "industry is not as good as commerce, and commerce is not as good as hoarding." These speculative merchants took advantage of the opportunity when the state's financial revenue and expenditure were not yet balanced and state-owned commerce had not yet gained a firm foothold to continue to stir up trouble on a large scale.

    In order to transform the Shanghai market and stabilize the people's livelihood, state-owned commerce transported rice, cotton cloth, and coal from all over the country to Shanghai after liberation to fight against speculative forces. The organized market appeared with the emergence of state-owned commerce. In March 1950, the state adopted unified financial and economic measures to balance the state's financial revenue and expenditure and stabilize prices. At that time, a large number of factories encountered great difficulties due to engaging in speculative activities and the disappearance of false purchasing power. State-owned commerce adopted processing, ordering, purchasing, and other measures to assist them. Industrial capital began to leave the free market and come into contact with the socialist state-owned economy. The organized market grew stronger and stronger in the struggle against speculative forces. From 1950 to 1953, the proportion of wholesale sales of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce in the market also increased from 32.71 percent to 64.33 percent; the proportion of retail sales increased from 10.7 percent to 37.57 percent. However, during the entire period of national economic recovery, the absolute value of the turnover of private commerce was still growing, and there was a certain degree of development. Due to the existence of the free market, speculative factors still existed and occasionally disrupted individual commodity markets. Especially when the nation entered a period of planned construction, speculative activities began to rise again under the new situation of further improvement of social purchasing power, launching an offensive against the state's planned construction and the further increase in the people's living standards. In the first half of 1953, private merchants from all over the country gathered in Shanghai to snap up various fast-selling industrial products. In the cotton cloth market, private merchants adopted the means of paying deposits in advance and raising prices to order khaki, poplin, corduroy, and seasonal printed cloth from private factories, disrupting the state's processing and ordering plan, and also engaging in snapping up and profiteering in the market. A lot of the cotton cloth supplied by state-owned companies to consumers fell into the hands of speculative merchants. Speculative activities also appeared in the grain and cooking oil markets. Speculative merchants hoarded and refused to sell a large amount of the necessities such as cooking oil and flour supplied by state-owned companies to citizens, or purchased them from state-owned companies and secretly transported them to other places for sale at higher prices. In the fourth quarter of 1953, the sales volume of cooking oil of state-owned companies in Shanghai suddenly increased by 48.78 percent compared with the first quarter, greatly exceeding the normal consumption volume, but some consumers still could not buy cooking oil. The lives of six million Shanghai citizens were seriously affected.

    Since the winter of 1953, the state has timely expanded processing orders and implemented unified purchase and sale of major commodities. The entire circulation process of major commodities such as grain, cotton cloth, and cooking oil has been incorporated into an organized and planned market, and speculation in the Shanghai market has begun to be effectively curbed. Shanghai citizens regard the stable grain prices and normal supply in 1954 as a miracle that occurred after the unified purchase and sale of grain. Citizens over middle age remember that when the country suffered a flood in 1931, landlords and rich peasants hoarded grain and refused to sell it, and Shanghai speculative merchants took the opportunity to raise grain prices by more than double. The flood in 1954 was much larger than in 1931, but six million Shanghai citizens were able to buy enough grain they needed at any time at the unified price set by the state. After the planned supply of cooking oil, the sales volume in the second quarter of 1954 dropped to the level of the first quarter of 1953, but the supply in the market was very normal. Shanghai citizens deeply realized that their lives have been reliably guaranteed due to the further expansion of the organized market.

    The further transformation of Shanghai, the nation's speculative market, has also provided a reliable guarantee for the state's planned construction. During the period of national economic recovery, speculative forces in the Shanghai market always took advantage of the state's difficulties to carry out market disturbances and sabotage. People still remember that when the American aggressors ignited the flames of war in Korea in 1950 and invaded our country's borders, speculative merchants in Shanghai said: "The opportunity to get rich has come." They launched two waves of grain price increases and one wave of white coal price increases, causing great losses to the state and the people. During the period of national construction, difficulties in which the production of certain consumer goods could not keep up with the needs due to concentrating efforts on developing heavy industry were unavoidable, but although there was a shortage of supply of certain materials in the Shanghai market in 1954, prices remained stable, and the retail prices of certain commodities were reduced due to the development of the organized market. For example, after all private cotton cloth stores distributed cotton cloth at state-owned company list prices, prices generally dropped by 3 to 5 percent.

    The blindness and destructiveness of private industries, which were greatly affected by the free market, have gradually been reduced under the leadership of the state plan. Many private weaving factories and dyeing factories used to have their own business offices and a large number of salesmen, specializing in market competition. When a certain cloth was selling well in the market, everyone went to produce that kind of cloth, and some even tore the cloth being woven on the machine and re-wove it. Now all private weaving factories and dyeing factories are producing according to the plan under the guidance of the state-owned cotton yarn and cloth company, and some factories are implementing the division of labor for certain products according to their equipment and specialties. As a result, the output and quality have been improved, and the balance between supply, production, and sales is becoming more and more balanced. In the past, private industries were affected by the peak and off-seasons of the free market, and there were often phenomena of stopping work and reducing production in the off-season and working overtime and producing inferior products in the peak season. In the first half of 1953, private merchants from all over the country snapped up various summer goods in Shanghai, forming a blind impact. The production of light-colored printed cloth, undershirts, and vests was extended to July and August, resulting in the inability to sell summer goods completely and the shortage of production and supply of winter supplies. In 1954, state-owned commerce planned to reserve materials that sell well in the peak season in the off-season, and the seasonal production imbalance was further adjusted. After the raw material market was included in the state plan, the supply of industrial raw materials that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood was guaranteed, and production became more normal.

    In the sales market, many commodities were transported through the free market in the past, often causing material backflow and damage. In 1953, the prices of certain industrial products and raw materials in the Shanghai market rose, and some even exceeded the prices in the sales area. Private merchants then transported the industrial products produced in Shanghai back from all over the country. One department store wholesaler even bought 60 million yuan worth of plastic combs from Guangzhou, transported them back to Shanghai, crushed them, and sold them as raw materials. The cooking oil, flour, and other necessities needed by the people of Shanghai were smuggled to other places in large quantities in 1953, causing difficulties in supply. In 1954, this phenomenon of material backflow and damage began to be stopped due to the reduction of free market trafficking. Many commodities have been rationally transported and distributed under the unified management of the state. In the past, a large amount of cotton cloth produced in Shanghai flowed to the northeast region due to the existence of the free market, while cotton cloth produced in Tianjin and Qingdao, which are closer to the northeast, flowed to the central and southern regions. At present, this unreasonable transfer has gradually been corrected under the unified management of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation. Due to the unified allocation of the state, Shanghai's industrial products will be supplied more to the countryside to exchange for grain and industrial raw materials needed by the city. The Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation, through a variety of survey research communication network covering the whole country, understands the needs of farmers in various places and has designed many new printed cloths that farmers like. A factory that used to produce a large number of urban-suitable half-open front health shirts has now paid attention to modifying them into full-open front shirts and full-open large-sleeved health shirts suitable for farmers under the guidance of the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Department Store Corporation. Western medicines and dyes that have never been to the countryside have been transferred to the countryside in large quantities through the modification of state-owned companies. Many raw materials have been prevented from being wasted under the unified allocation of the state. In particular, precious raw materials such as copper and rubber are gradually being used to ensure the production of national construction and people's livelihood necessities first.

    Due to the rapid expansion of the organized market, which has restricted market speculation, the weaknesses of private retailers such as poor management, huge expenses, and shortage of funds have become more exposed. In the past, industries that did not rely on the normal needs of Shanghai citizens, but relied on the development of external mobile purchasing power, have become excessive or unevenly distributed due to the gradual disappearance of external purchasing power: there are too many shops in the city center, and there is a shortage in the residential areas of working people. The exposure of these weaknesses requires further transformation and overall arrangement of private retailers. Recently, state-owned commerce has taken measures to reduce the starting point of wholesale, simplify wholesale procedures, and increase wholesale institutions to facilitate private retailers to increase purchases, and continue to gradually incorporate private retailers into the state capitalist track with emphasis. On the other hand, for private retailers who have initially accepted the transformation, the government is urging them to further improve their operation, management, and operation style, and is carrying out the adjustment of the retail network.

    从上海市场的改造看有组织市场的优越性
    张家炽
    自从国家进入有计划的经济建设时期，特别是国家对粮食、油料、棉花、棉布等主要物资先后实行统购统销以后，在全国最大的商业中心——上海，发生了有组织有计划的市场迅速发展，盲目的自由市场日益缩小的新的巨大的变化。
    一九五四年国家实行棉布统购统销和继续扩大对上海私营工业的加工订货以来，已逐渐掌握了上海出产的主要工业品货源。行销全国的上海工业品已基本上由国营公司通过内部调拨有计划地供应全国各地，自由市场贩运大大减少，有的已完全被有组织有计划地调运所代替。一九五四年第一季度上海私营大型工业总产值中加工、订货、统购、包销、收购的比重占百分之八十六点六七，至第三季度已达到百分之九十一点七九。一九五三年上海出产的棉布中，通过私商向外埠贩运的还有五百六十多万匹，一九五四年上半年私商贩运量已减到五万多匹，自九月中旬棉布统购统销实行后，上海这个全国最大的纺织工业中心所出产的棉布，已完全由中国花纱布公司上海采购供应站根据国家计划供应全国人民需要。由于国家对主要农产品实行统购和大力发展燃料工业，上海六百万市民和上万家工厂所需要的大批粮食、燃料、工业原料，一九五四年以来也逐步由国家有计划地输入供应，自由市场流入量逐步减少，以至完全停止。
    国家在上海市场上掌握了主要商品后，大豆、花生、小麦、棉花、烟叶、棉纱、坯布等工业原料和半成品已基本上不通过自由市场，而由国家有计划地直接拨付工厂加工成品，或直接供应工厂进行生产。燃料、化工原料、五金器材、医药用品等，有关国营公司也开始直接供应用户。经营消费品的私营零售商大多转向国营公司进货，并已开始通过不同程度的社会主义改造纳入国家计划。全市一千四百九十八家私营米店已改造为国营粮食公司的代销店；对经营棉布、食油、食糖、煤球、卷烟、胶鞋、绒线、纸张、百货等两万多家私营零售店实行代销、经销或有计划的批购。这些零售店在职工监督下有计划地向国营公司进货，按照国营公司的零售价格或统一规定的价格出售。粮食、食油、棉布等商品并已按国家规定实行定量供应或定点供应。
    由于上海和外埠之间有组织有计划的物资交流和上海销售市场上有组织有计划的供应，行商、客帮、掮客的活动大大减少。一九五四年一月到八月各地私商设立在上海的棉布、百货等采办庄已有四百七十家结束业务。批发交易市场的业务日趋清淡，到目前为止，已有米、杂粮油饼、面粉、煤、糖、棉布、绒线、绸缎等八个批发市场和交易所批准撤销。私营批发商在商品流转中的作用日渐消失了。
    上海市场上出现的这种新的巨大的变化，标志着这个曾经是全国最大的、历史最久的资本主义投机市场的改造工作，已进入一个新的历史阶段。
    仅仅在五年半以前，上海还是一个被称为“冒险家乐园”的半殖民地半封建性质的巨大投机市场。当时这里集中了具有几十年投机经验的帝国主义资本家、官僚买办资本家和其他各种投机资本家。他们拥有二十四个批发市场和从事金银、外币、证券买卖的交易所，买空卖空、囤积居奇，组织大规模的投机活动，整个市场和人民生活都被他们所操纵，影响波及全国。上海解放后，帝国主义和官僚资本的投机势力基本上被消灭，但遗留下来全靠在市场上“抢帽子”“踢皮球”为生的冒险家们还有很多。在所谓“正当”的工商户中，由于长期的“工不如商、商不如囤”的投机市场影响，也大多没有放弃投机活动。这些投机商人乘解放初期国家财政收支尚未平衡和国营商业立足未稳的机会，继续大规模地兴风作浪。
    为了改造上海市场和安定人民生活，国营商业在上海解放后就从全国各地调运大米、棉布、煤炭来和投机势力作斗争。有组织的市场随着国营商业的出现而出现了。一九五零年三月，国家采取统一财经措施，使国家财政收支平衡，物价稳定。当时大批工厂由于从事投机活动和虚假购买力的消失而遭到很大的困难，国营商业采取了加工、订货、收购等措施加以扶助。工业资本开始离开自由市场而同社会主义的国营经济发生联系。有组织的市场在和投机势力的斗争中日益壮大起来。从一九五零年到一九五三年，国营商业和合作社商业在市场上的批发销售比重也由百分之三十二点七一增加到百分之六十四点三三；零售比重由百分之十点七增加到百分之三十七点五七。但在整个国民经济恢复时期内，私营商业营业额的绝对值仍然是增长的，并有一定程度的发展。由于自由市场存在，投机因素依然存在着，并且不时对个别商品市场进行扰乱。特别在国家进入有计划建设时期，社会购买力进一步提高的新情况下，投机活动又开始抬头，向国家有计划的建设和人民生活水平的进一步高涨实行进攻。一九五三年上半年，全国各地私商纷纷集中上海抢购各种畅销工业品。在棉布市场上，私商采取预付定金、抬高价格的手段向私营工厂定购卡其、府绸、灯芯绒和时令花布，破坏国家的加工订货计划，同时在市场进行抢购、套购。国营公司供应消费者的棉布，许多落入投机商人手中。粮食、食油市场上也出现了投机活动，国营公司供应给市民的食油、面粉等必需品，投机商人曾大量囤积拒售，或向国营公司套购后偷运外埠抬价出售。一九五三年第四季度，国营公司在上海的食油销售量突然比第一季度增加百分之四十八点七八，大大超过了正常消费量，但一部分消费者仍然买不到食油。六百万上海市民的生活受到严重的影响。
    一九五三年冬季以来，国家及时地扩大了加工订货，并对主要物资实行统购统销，粮食、棉布、食油等主要商品的整个流转过程被纳入了有组织有计划的市场，上海市场的投机性已开始被有效地制止了。上海市民把一九五四年粮价平稳，供应正常，看做是粮食统购统销后出现的奇迹。中年以上的市民都记得，一九三一年全国遭遇水灾时，地主富农把粮食都囤积起来不卖，上海投机商人乘机把粮价抬高了一倍多。一九五四年洪水比一九三一年大得多，但上海六百万市民都能随时按国家规定的统一价格买到他们需要的足够的粮食。食油计划供应后，一九五四年第二季度销售量便下降到一九五三年第一季度的水平，但市场上供应十分正常。上海市民深深地体会到，由于有组织市场的进一步扩大，他们的生活已获得可靠的保障。
    上海这个全国性的投机市场进一步被改造，使国家有计划的建设也得到可靠的保证。在国民经济恢复时期内，上海市场上的投机势力总是利用国家的困难来进行市场骚动和破坏的。人们还记得，一九五零年美国侵略者在朝鲜燃起战争的火焰，并向我国边境进犯的时候，上海的投机商人便说：“发财的机会来了”。他们发动了两次食粮涨风和一次白煤涨风，使国家和人民受到很大的损失。在国家建设时期，由于集中力量发展重工业，某些消费品生产赶不上需要的困难是不可避免的，但一九五四年上海市场上某些物资虽有供应不足现象，物价依旧平稳，某些商品的零售价格由于有组织市场发展反而有所降低。例如所有私营棉布店按国营公司牌价经销棉布以后，价格一般下降百分之三到五。
    原来受自由市场影响很大的私营工业，在国家计划的领导下，生产上的盲目性和破坏性逐渐缩小。许多私营织布厂和印染厂过去都拥有自己的营业所和大批跑街，专门从事市场竞争。当市场上什么布好销时，大家都去生产那种布，甚至有的把正在机上织着的布扯下盘头另织。现在所有私营织布厂和印染厂都在国营花纱布公司指导下按计划进行生产，有的工厂并按其设备和特长，实行某些产品的分工，由此产量、质量都有提高，供产销日趋平衡。私营工业过去受自由市场淡旺季的影响，常有淡季中停工减产，旺季中加班加点、粗制滥造的现象。一九五三年上半年由于各地私商在上海抢购各种夏令货，形成盲目的冲击力，浅色花布、汗衫、背心的生产延长到七、八月份，造成夏令货不能完全销出、冬季用品生产和供应不足的恶果。一九五四年国营商业有计划地在淡季中储备旺季畅销物资，季节性的生产不平衡进一步得到调节。原料市场纳入国家计划后，有利国计民生的工业原料供应有了保证，生产更加正常。
    在销售市场上，过去许多商品通过自由市场贩运，常造成物资倒流和破坏。一九五三年上海市场上某些工业品和原料价格上涨，有的甚至超过销地价格，私商便从全国各地把上海出产的工业品倒运回来。有一家百货批发商竟从广州套购了价值六千万元的塑胶梳子，运回上海捣碎作原料出售。上海人民所需要的食油、面粉等一九五三年曾被大量偷运到外地去，造成供应的困难。一九五四年由于自由市场贩运减少，这种物资倒流和破坏现象开始被制止。许多商品在国家统一经营下并已实行合理调运和合理分配。过去上海出产的棉布因有自由市场存在，流往东北地区的数量很大，而离东北较近的天津、青岛出产的棉布却流向中南区。目前在中国花纱布公司的统一经营下，这种不合理的调运已逐渐纠正。上海出产的工业品，由于国家统一分配，将更多地供应农村，以换取城市需要的粮食和工业原料。中国花纱布公司上海采购供应站通过满布全国的品种调查研究通讯网，了解各地农民的需要，设计了许多农民喜爱的新花布。从前生产大批城市适用的半开襟卫生衫的工厂，在中国百货公司上海采购供应站的指导下，现已注意改制农民适用的全开襟衫和全开襟大袖卫生衫了。从未下乡的西药、染料，通过国营公司的改装而大批调往农村。许多原料在国家统一分配下已制止了浪费。特别是铜料、橡胶等宝贵的原料，正逐步做到首先保证国家建设和人民生活必需品的生产。
    由于有组织市场的迅速扩大，限制了市场投机，私营零售商经营不善、开支庞大、资金短少等弱点更加暴露出来。过去并非依靠上海市民的正常需要，而是依靠外来流动购买力发展起来的行业，由于外来购买力逐渐消失，有的已显得过剩，有的显得分布不平衡：市中心商店过多，劳动人民住宅区则有不足现象。这些弱点的暴露，要求对私营零售商作进一步的改造和全面的安排。最近国营商业已采取降低批发起点、简化批发手续、增设批发机构等办法以便利私营零售商增加进货，并继续有重点地将私营零售商逐步纳入国家资本主义轨道。另一方面，对已经初步接受改造的私营零售商，政府正督促他们进一步改善经营管理和经营作风，并进行零售网的调整工作。
