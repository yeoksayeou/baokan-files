Xinhua News Agency, January 7th: The Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Food, and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives of the People's Republic of China issued a joint directive on December 26th of last year, requiring all subordinate units to make good preparations for the supply of goods to rural areas during the Spring Festival.

The directive requires state-owned commercial and food departments and supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels, under the leadership of the local People's Government Financial and Economic Committee, to quickly and comprehensively arrange the supply of goods to rural areas for the Spring Festival, and to divide labor and cooperate to strengthen the organization of sources of goods and transportation, and to transport the goods for the festival supply to the grassroots retail units in a timely manner; for materials subject to planned supply, the sales plan must be guaranteed to be completed; for materials under control of sales, more consideration should be given to the needs of rural areas, and reasonable allocation and timely supply should be ensured.

The directive made specific provisions for the main materials needed to supply rural areas during the Spring Festival, such as grain, edible oil, meat, sugar, other non-staple foods, and small commodities. The directive pointed out that in some areas where stocks of certain grain varieties are insufficient, the food departments must earnestly adjust the supply of varieties within their capabilities; state-owned commercial administrative departments at all levels should urge state-owned oil companies and supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels to add the edible oil that was planned to be sold but not sold in the fourth quarter of last year to the edible oil planned to be sold in January this year, and concentrate it for sale during the Spring Festival.

The directive finally pointed out that grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in various places should, before the Spring Festival, universally hold small exchange fairs focusing on the sale of festival goods, organize farmers to visit and purchase, and can also absorb private merchants and vendors to participate in the transaction.
