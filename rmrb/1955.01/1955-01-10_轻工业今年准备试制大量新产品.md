Xinhua News Agency: State-owned light industry, based on the successful trial production of many new product varieties last year, will trial produce even more new product varieties this year.

Last year, the pharmaceutical industry successfully trial produced new products including: Vitamin C for treating scurvy, hydrochlorothiazide for treating peptic ulcers, ergot for women to take after childbirth, chlortetracycline for treating peritonitis, paratyphoid, typhus, trachoma, dysentery and other diseases, amithiozone for treating tuberculosis and leprosy, and a German-made X-ray fluoroscopy table for hospital fluoroscopy. Some of these new products are already in formal production, and some are still in the experimental stage. The prices of general products are lower than those of imported goods. New drugs to be trial produced this year include procaine hydrochloride, which is used for local anesthesia and is also the main raw material for the manufacture of procaine penicillin; phenobarbital, which has a small dosage, strong hypnotic effect, and treats insomnia; and santonin and kusin for expelling roundworms. Medical devices to be trial produced this year include more than 20 kinds such as electro-hypnosis machines for treating mental illness and other diseases.

New products manufactured by the rubber industry last year included tires for large trucks. These tires have now traveled more than 30,000 kilometers, and none have been damaged. It is estimated that they can travel 50,000 kilometers. Last year, a tire specially for horse-drawn carriages and many kinds of rubber accessories for industrial use were also trial-produced. This year, the rubber industry plans to trial-produce seven new specifications of tires. After these tires are formally produced, the cars manufactured by China's first automobile factory, the tractors manufactured by the first tractor factory, and the sedans running in large cities can all be equipped with tires produced in China. In order to cooperate with the production preparation work of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, the rubber industry will trial-produce more than 90 kinds of rubber accessories for assembling automobiles this year that meet the requirements of oil resistance, shock resistance, sealing, and air pressure resistance. The rubber industry also plans to trial-produce 26 new products this year, such as water boots and gloves with a withstand voltage of more than 30,000 watts, and oil-resistant and smooth printing rubber sheets.

The paper industry successfully trial-produced 11 new products last year, all of which were supplied to industrial and postal and telecommunications departments. This year, 26 kinds of industrial paper are planned for trial production. In order to supply the needs of the textile industry, the trial production of rayon wood pulp will begin this year. Colored book cover paper for textbook covers will also be formally produced this year.

The state-owned food industry will also add many new varieties and designs this year. For example, canned foods will add more than a dozen kinds of vegetables such as beans, peas, eggplants, and pickled cucumbers, as well as canned fish, meat, and fruits. Sweet milk powder with sugar will be newly added to dairy products.
