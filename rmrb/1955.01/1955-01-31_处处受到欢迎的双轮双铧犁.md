A Warm Welcome

One day, the Xinmin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Changshan Township, Suixi County, Anhui Province, received a letter from the township government stating that the supply and marketing cooperative would lend them a double-share plow. At that time, everyone happily said: "We have a double-share plow, let's get it and use it quickly."

Early the next morning, the cooperative sent Cai Jicheng and Cai Jiliang to drive a large cart to the supply and marketing cooperative, thirty miles away, to pull back the double-share plow. That day, the members of the cooperative were anxiously waiting for the double-share plow, as if they were waiting for a guest who was about to arrive. It was already dark, but the cart had not returned, so everyone ran outside the village to wait. After a while, a rumbling sound of a large cart suddenly came from a distance, which made everyone very happy, and they shouted: "The double-share plow is coming! The double-share plow is coming!" The children even sang a song composed to welcome the double-share plow:

    …The double-share plow is lent to us,
    Plowing deep and wide,
    With the double-share plow this year,
    Increased production is guaranteed next year.…

When the double-share plow was transported to the cooperative, men, women, old and young in the whole village, carrying lamps, crowded into the cooperative to see the double-share plow, and said that the government was too concerned about the peasants, and they must work hard to produce and support national construction.

The Fields Plowed by the Double-Share Plow Have Strong and Even Wheat Seedlings

Last year, the Xuzhou Special District of Jiangsu Province promoted a total of 686 double-share plows to agricultural production cooperatives. Wherever they were promoted, farmers inside and outside the cooperatives praised them. Zhang Yujin, a member of the Xinxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Tongshan County, praised after using the double-share plow: "I used to be so tired that my back ached after plowing for a day with the old plow; with the double-share plow, I don't need to hold the handles while plowing, and I still have the strength to carry two loads of water after plowing for a day." Old man Zhang gave the double-share plow a name "Three No Aches" - no backache, no shoulder ache, no palm ache, and insisted that the cooperative let him keep the double-share plow; after each use, he polished the plowshare until it was shiny, and even put the pliers for repairing the double-share plow under his pillow when he went to bed at night.

Women are even happier to use the double-share plow. Ning Yulan, a female member of the Xinmin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Suining County, can also do heavy work such as plowing fields, in addition to light work such as harvesting and weeding, since the cooperative added the double-share plow; this year she is assigned to be responsible for plowing 20 mu of land. The female members of the cooperative are all happy to say: "With the double-share plow, women don't have to work so hard to plow the fields." As a result, many female members have earned more work points.

The wheat planted in the fields plowed by the double-share plow last year had strong and even wheat seedlings, which were lush green and much more vigorous than the wheat planted in the fields plowed by the old plow.

Suitable for Both Paddy Fields and Dry Land

Before the double-wheel double-share plow was tested in paddy fields, many farmers were worried that the double-wheel double-share plow was only suitable for use in dry land areas in the north, and that the soil in paddy fields was sticky and not suitable for the double-share plow; some people were afraid that one ox would not be able to pull it, and that it would be difficult to walk if two oxen were pulling it side by side. In short, farmers had many concerns about using the double-wheel double-share plow.

Recently, the Songjiang Special District Farm in Jiangsu Province held a double-share plow research group, inviting members of nearby agricultural production cooperatives and cadres of supply and marketing cooperatives to participate. On the day when the double-wheel double-share plow was tested in the paddy fields of the special district farm, two oxen pulled the double-share plow and ran through the paddy fields, and the sticky soil did not stick to the plowshare at all. At that time, the farm staff also made many demonstrations of the double-share plow: it can plow as deep or as shallow as needed; it can not only plow large areas of paddy fields, but also cultivate ridges, and the ridges were made very beautiful. This attracted everyone who came to visit the test plowing, and they all praised the double-share plow, and some even went up to try it themselves. Shen Baogen, a member of the Lianmin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Songjiang County who had experience in plowing fields, said: "The soil plowed by the double-share plow is turned over in chunks, and it is most suitable for winter plowing to improve the soil in rice paddies." Some people immediately inquired about the price of the double-wheel double-share plow and the procedures for ordering it.

Also Suitable for Hilly Areas

During the urgent winter sowing season last year, more than 100 mu of small spring crops in the Rao Xingli Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xishui County, Hubei Province, had not been sown at all. Because it had not rained for more than two months, the land in the whole cooperative was as dry and hard as a slate. In order to resist drought and rush to plant, the cooperative broke five old plows in one day, but did not plow a piece of land. The members of the cooperative were very anxious. At this time, the comrades of the agricultural technology promotion station introduced them to plow the land with a double-wheel double-share plow, and the cooperative cadres also felt that this was a good way to resist drought and rush to plant. However, when the double-wheel double-share plow was moved to the cooperative, some members were afraid that the oxen would not be able to pull it when they saw that the double-share plow was all iron, and some people said that this was a hilly area, and most of it was small terraced fields, and they were afraid that it would be difficult to turn around. After half a day of testing, not only could the double-share plow be used on small terraced fields, but also the land that could not be plowed by the old plow could be plowed smoothly and deeply by the double-share plow. Therefore, the whole cooperative completed the winter sowing task last year in a timely manner, and also saved more than 20 man-days and more than 20 ox-days to invest in sideline production.

It's Easier for Women to Learn to Plow

The double-wheel double-share plow was warmly welcomed by the farmers in Linhai and Cixi counties, Zhejiang Province. In late December last year, when the Linhai County Agricultural Technology Promotion Station demonstrated the use of double-wheel double-share plows in paddy fields at the Linqiao Farm in the county, representatives from various places were sent to visit. The representatives saw that the fields plowed by the double-wheel double-share plow were smooth and deep, and one person and two oxen could plow more than 1.7 mu of paddy fields in one hour, which was more than twice as fast as the old plow, and the double-share plow could also be deep or shallow, and could also reduce labor intensity. The female representatives were happy to say after seeing it: "This makes it easier for us women to learn to plow." Therefore, the representatives said at that time that they would vigorously promote the double-wheel double-share plow when they went back. When the double-wheel double-share plow was transported to the Wudongzha Collective Farm in Cixi County, the members of the farm regarded it as a happy event, and everyone excitedly spread the news. The next day, the members of the farm moved the double-share plow to the field for test plowing. In a short while, two female members of the farm learned how to use it. During the test plowing, nearby farmers ran over to watch, and some even came to visit from Shengshantou, more than 40 li away. After seeing it, they were all preparing to buy double-share plows.

Organize Well to Use the New Plow

When the Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative in Hancheng County, Shaanxi Province, was winter plowing, it borrowed a double-wheel double-share plow from the county farm. At that time, there were twenty or thirty farmers who went to see it, and they kept asking questions, which made the farm tool handler unable to explain it all.

The next day, Wang Lingwen, the director of the cooperative, drove the livestock to plow the land with a double-wheel double-share plow, and a large group of men and women came again. Many male and female members of the cooperative also came, all vying to hold the plow. Member Xue Zhengxi grabbed the plow handle and happily plowed the land, while saying to the people watching: "This plow is extremely stable. When you get to the end of the field, just press the adjusting rod, and you don't need to use much force." Before he had plowed twice, female member Xue Bianwa competed to drive the ox and start plowing.

Because of the continuous improvement of operating skills, the plowing of land increased day by day. Only seven mu of land were plowed on the first day, nine mu on the second day, ten mu on the third day, and twelve mu on the fourth day. People from nine villages in the whole township came to see it every day. Liu Yulang from the ninth village said after seeing the double-wheel double-share plow: "If we don't organize, we won't be able to use this kind of plow. After I go back, I must rectify the mutual aid group in our village. In the future, when we become a cooperative, we will be able to use this kind of plow."

Can Also Be Used in Clay Soil

The double-wheel double-share plow has been successfully tested in paddy fields with clay soil in Fujian Province. Except for some rotten mud fields that are not suitable for use, most paddy fields in Fujian Province can be used. This kind of plow turns the soil more easily than the old-fashioned plow, and plows deeper and more densely. More than 30 state-owned farms in Fujian Province have conducted tests in paddy fields, and the surrounding farmers have seen its effect. The first batch of more than 140 double-wheel double-share plows were transported to Fuzhou, and they were quickly sold out.

    处处受到欢迎的双轮双铧犁
    一次热烈的欢迎
    安徽省濉溪县常山乡新民农业生产合作社，有一天接到乡政府一封信，信里说供销合作社要贷给他们一部双铧犁。当时，大家都高兴地说：双铧犁有了，快拿来使吧。
    第二天一早，社里就派了蔡即成、蔡即良两人，赶着一辆大车，到离社三十里远的供销合作社里去拉双铧犁。这一天，社员们就像在等待着一位将要到来的客人一样，焦急地盼望着双铧犁。天已经黑了，还不见大车回来，大家就都跑到村子外面去等。隔了一会，猛然从远处传来一阵隆隆的大车声音，这可把大家喜坏了，都高声嚷着：双铧犁来了！双铧犁来了！孩子们还唱着为迎接双铧犁编的歌子：
    ……双铧犁贷给咱，
    耕的深来犁的宽，
    今年有了双铧犁，
    明年保证能增产。……
    双铧犁运到了合作社里，全村男女老幼提着灯，拥到社里来看双铧犁，都说政府对农民太关心了，一定要努力生产，支援国家建设。
    双铧犁耕的田麦苗壮又齐
    去年，江苏省徐州专区以农业生产合作社为对象，共推广了六百八十六部双铧犁。推广的地方，不管社内社外的农民都夸奖好。铜山县新星农业生产合作社的社员张玉瑾，用过双铧犁后夸赞说：“我用旧犁耕一天，到晚上累得腰酸背疼；用双铧犁耕地不用扶把，耕了一天地，还有劲挑两担水。”张老爹给双铧犁起了个名字“三不疼”——腰不疼、膀子不疼、手心不疼，并且一定要社里让他保管双铧犁；每次用过以后，他都把犁铧擦得雪亮，连晚上睡觉时也把修理双铧犁的钳子放在枕头底下。
      妇女们用上了双铧犁更高兴。睢宁县新民农业生产合作社女社员宁玉兰，自从社里添了双铧犁以后，除了干收割、薅草等轻活计外，也能干耕田的重活了；她今年就分工负责耕二十亩田。社里的女社员都高兴地说：有了双铧犁，妇女耕田不吃力了。很多女社员因此多得了工分。
    去年用双铧犁耕田种下去的麦子，麦苗长得又壮又整齐，一片嫩绿，比用旧犁耕田种下的麦子要旺盛得多。
    水田和旱地一样使用
    在双轮双铧犁试耕水田以前，很多农民担心双轮双铧犁只适合北方旱田地区使用，水田土质带粘性，不适用双铧犁；有的人怕一只牛拉不动，两只牛并排拉，不好走。归总一句话：农民对使用双轮双铧犁顾虑很多。
      最近，江苏省松江专区农场举办了双铧犁研究小组，邀请附近的农业生产合作社社员、供销合作社的干部等来参加。当双轮双铧犁在专区农场试耕水田的那一天，两条牛拉了双铧犁在水稻田里呼呼地跑，带粘性的土一点也不粘犁铧。当时农场工作人员还把双铧犁作了许多表演：要耕深就耕深，要耕浅就耕浅；不但能耕大片水田，并且还能畦耕，畦头做得很漂亮。把参观试耕的人都吸引住了，大家异口同声地夸赞双铧犁好，有的人还亲手上去试试看。松江县联民农业生产合作社有耕田经验的社员沈宝根说：“双铧犁耕过的泥土块块翻转，稻板田用它冬耕改良土壤最适宜。”有的人当场就打听双轮双铧犁的价钱和订购的手续。
    丘陵地带也很适用
    正当去年冬播紧迫的日子，湖北省浠水县饶兴礼农业生产合作社的一百多亩小春作物地却一点也未播种。因为两个多月未下雨，全社的土地干旱得像石板一样坚硬，社里为了抗旱抢种，一天内弄断了五个旧犁，也未翻犁出一块地，社员们都很着急。这时，农业技术推广站的同志就介绍他们用双轮双铧犁犁地，社干部也觉得这是抗旱抢种的好办法。可是当双轮双铧犁搬来社里的时候，大家一见双铧犁混身是铁，就有些社员怕牛拉不动，还有人说，这里是丘陵地带，大多数是小块的梯田，怕不好转弯。经过半天的试验，不仅在小块的梯田上能使用双铧犁，而且旧犁犁不动的地，双铧犁都能犁得又平又深，因此，全社及时完成了去年冬播任务，并且还节省了二十多个人工和二十多个牛工投入到副业生产上去。
    妇女学犁田也容易了
    双轮双铧犁受到浙江省临海、慈溪两县农民的热烈欢迎。去年十二月下旬，临海县农业技术推广站在该县林桥农场水田使用双轮双铧犁犁田示范时，各地都派代表来参观。代表们看到双轮双铧犁犁的田又平又深，一小时，一个人两头牛，就可犁一亩七分多水田，比旧犁快两倍多，而且双铧犁又能深能浅，还能减轻劳动强度。妇女代表看了都高兴地说：这样我们妇女学会犁田也容易了。因此，代表们当时都纷纷表示回去要大力推广双轮双铧犁。双轮双铧犁运到慈溪县五洞闸集体农庄时，庄员们把它当做一件喜事，大家都兴奋地奔走相告，第二天，庄员们就把双铧犁搬到田里去试耕，一会工夫，两个女庄员就学会使用了。在试耕时，附近农民都跑来看，有的从四十多里外的胜山头跑来参观。他们看过后，都准备购买双铧犁。

    组织起来好使用新犁
    陕西省韩城县五星农业社在冬耕的时候，从县农场借回来一部双轮双铧犁。当时就有二、三十个农民去看，还问这问那，弄的农具手解释不过来。
    第二天社主任王令闻赶着牲口在地里用双轮双铧犁犁地了，男男女女又来了一大堆。许多男女社员也来了，都争着要扶犁。社员薛正修捉住犁把，一边高兴的犁地，一边向看的人说：“这犁稳极了，到地头时，光把调节杆压一下就行，再也用不着费很大力气了。”还没耕上两遭，女社员薛变娃又争着赶牛犁开了。
    因为操作技术的不断提高，犁的地一天比一天增多。头一天只犁了七亩地，第二天就犁了九亩，第三天犁了十亩，第四天就是十二亩了。全乡九个村，每天都有人来看。九村柳雨郎看了双轮双铧犁以后说：“不组织起来就用不成这号犁。我回去后一定要把我村的互助组整顿好，将来转了社，也就能用上这号犁了。”
    粘质土壤也能使用
    双轮双铧犁在福建省粘质土壤的水田里试犁成功。除部分烂泥田不宜采用外，福建省大部分水田都可以使用。这种犁比旧式犁翻土轻快，犁得深、犁得密。福建省已有三十多个国营农场在水田里作了试验，周围农民看到了它的效果。第一批一百四十多部双轮双铧犁运抵福州后，很快就销售一空。
