Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, January 25th: The People's Liberation Army land, sea, and air forces on the Zhejiang and Fujian fronts are spending the Spring Festival vigilantly guarding the motherland's coast.

    On the Zhejiang front, at the bases of the People's Liberation Army land and naval forces, starting from the morning of the 24th, the songs "The East is Red" and the March of the People's Liberation Army broadcast by wired broadcasting stations could be heard. Many company clubs were filled with the sound of gongs and drums. The soldiers who liberated Yijiangshan Island congratulated each other on the Spring Festival and on their victory when they met. The Fifth Company of a certain unit, which first broke through the beachhead and first planted the red flag on Highland 203 in the battle to liberate Yijiangshan Island, selected more than twenty representatives to hold a discussion with a certain naval unit that coordinated the landing operation. They expressed to each other that they would study even more actively and cooperate closely in future battles to liberate coastal islands and Taiwan to strive for greater victories. The soldiers of this company also wrote letters to the naval landing craft units and the air force units that participated in the battle to congratulate them on their victory and praised their spirit of unity and bravery displayed in the cross-sea operation.

On the 24th, all naval units strengthened maritime patrols to protect the coastal people in celebrating the Spring Festival. The soldiers held various recreational and sports activities at the naval base and held a get-together with the local people.
