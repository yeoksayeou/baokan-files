Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 8th. Sichuan Province convened its first representative meeting of families of martyrs, families of soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, demobilized construction soldiers, and model representatives of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers from December 28, 1954, to January 4 this year.

    The meeting reviewed and summarized the preferential treatment work of the past five years in accordance with the spirit of the general line. The meeting pointed out that more than 70 percent of the families of martyrs and soldiers in the province have participated in agricultural mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and 80 percent of the demobilized construction soldiers engaged in agricultural production have also joined mutual aid and cooperative organizations. Poor families of martyrs and soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers of the second class or above who lack labor have all received assistance from the masses in plowing their land. In the past five years, the people's government has distributed more than 113 billion yuan in kind subsidies, solving the production and living difficulties of many families of martyrs and soldiers. Many soldiers' families often write letters to encourage their relatives to perform meritorious service for the people on the front lines. As of the end of the Korean War, 29,500 soldiers in 125 counties and cities in the province had received third-class merit or higher on the Korean battlefield.

    The meeting also discussed and determined the tasks of preferential treatment work in the future. It was also decided to launch a large-scale mass movement to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of soldiers during the Spring Festival, and to conduct a comprehensive and in-depth inspection of the preferential treatment work in various places.

    At the meeting, representatives introduced their own deeds of working hard in production, actively working and studying, and helping families of martyrs and soldiers, and exchanged experiences in work and production. The representatives all stated that they would work hard to produce, encourage their relatives at the front, and contribute to the country's socialist construction and support the liberation of Taiwan.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 8th. The winter production and life of families of martyrs and soldiers in the disaster-stricken areas of Hubei Province have received warm care and assistance from the local people's government and the people.

    In 1954, the Hubei Provincial People's Government issued 20.6 billion yuan in production and living subsidies to families of martyrs and soldiers in disaster areas and non-disaster areas throughout the province. After the disaster occurred, the government specially issued another production and living subsidy to families of martyrs and soldiers. Recently, the Hubei Provincial People's Government notified all localities to do a good job in plowing on behalf of families of martyrs and soldiers in disaster areas, and to help families of martyrs and soldiers solve problems such as plowing cattle, farm tools, seeds, fertilizers, and living rations for the lonely, elderly, disabled and weak, and requested that preferential treatment fees be distributed again quickly before the Spring Festival, focusing on key areas.

    The people in the disaster areas also actively helped families of martyrs and soldiers solve their production and living difficulties. Yan Liucheng, the director of the Hongxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Miaoling Township, Echeng County, led more than 20 male and female members to move the home of soldier Tian Huaying to a safe area first when the flood came. After the water receded, they repaired Tian Huaying's house first. There are sixteen families of martyrs and soldiers in Zhibu Township, Mianyang County, with about fifty mu of land. The local people have helped them plant rapeseed, wheat and other winter crops on all forty mu of the drained land.

    The families of martyrs and soldiers expressed their great gratitude for the meticulous care given by the people's government and the people.

    四川省春节将开展拥军优属工作
    湖北省灾区烈属军属受到热情的照顾
    【新华社成都八日电】四川省从一九五四年十二月二十八日到今年一月四日召开了第一次烈属、军属、革命残废军人、复员建设军人及拥军优属模范代表会议。
    会议根据总路线的精神，检查总结了五年来的优抚工作。会议指出，现在全省有百分之七十以上的烈属、军属参加了农业互助合作组织，从事农业生产的复员建设军人中参加互助合作组织的也达到百分之八十。贫苦而缺乏劳动力的烈属、军属和二等以上革命残废军人都得到了群众的代耕帮助。五年来，人民政府共发放了实物补助费一千一百三十多亿元，解决了许多烈属、军属生产、生活的困难。不少军属经常写信鼓励自己的亲人在前线为人民立功。截至朝鲜停战时止，全省一百二十五个县、市在朝鲜战场荣立三等功以上的战士有二万九千五百多人。
    会议还讨论确定了今后优抚工作的任务。并决定在春节期间，开展一个规模较大的群众性的拥军优属运动，对各地优抚工作普遍进行一次全面深入的检查。
    会上，代表们介绍了他们自己努力生产、积极工作、学习和帮助烈属、军属的事迹，并互相交流了工作和生产的经验。代表们都表示，今后要努力生产，鼓励前方亲人，为祖国社会主义建设和支援解放台湾贡献自己的力量。
    【新华社武汉八日电】湖北省受水灾地区的烈属军属的冬季生产和生活，受到当地人民政府和人民的热情照顾和帮助。
    湖北省人民政府在一九五四年发给全省灾区以及非灾区烈属军属的生产生活补助费有二百零六亿元，在灾情发生后，政府又特地给烈属军属补发了一次生产生活补助费。最近，湖北省人民政府通知各地做好灾区的代耕工作，和帮助烈属军属解决耕牛、农具、种籽、肥料及孤老残弱的生活口粮等问题，并且要求在春节前迅速有重点地再发放一次优抚费。
    灾区的人民也积极帮助烈军属解决生产和生活中的困难。鄂城县庙岭乡红星农业生产合作社社长严柳成在大水来时，带领着二十多个男女社员，首先将军属田化英的家搬往安全区域。在水退以后，他们又先把田化英家的房子修好。沔阳县织布乡有烈属军属十六户，有田地约五十亩，当地人民已帮助他们在四十亩退水的田地上全部种上了油菜、小麦等冬季作物。
    烈属、军属对人民政府和人民给予的无微不至的照顾，表示非常感激。
