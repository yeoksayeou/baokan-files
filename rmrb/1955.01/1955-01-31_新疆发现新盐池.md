Xinjiang discovers new salt lake

In order to change the situation of short production caused by wind and sand erosion of its salt fields over the years, the Xinjiang Provincial Salt Affairs Bureau mobilized the employees of the Jinghe Salt Field in 1954 to go deep into the Gobi Desert to find new salt sources. As a result, a new salt lake was discovered in Shaquanzi near Jinghe. Preliminary estimates put its reserves at more than 800,000 tons. The quality is very good, containing 96.20% sodium chloride, and the mining is also very simple. (Fu Xiashan)

    新疆发现新盐池
    新疆省盐务局为改变所属盐场历年遭受风沙侵袭而造成的短产局面，在一九五四年发动精河盐场职工深入戈壁寻找新盐源，结果在精河附近的沙泉子发现新盐池一座，初步估计它的蕴藏量在八十万吨以上，质量很好，含氯化钠百分之九六·二○，采捞也很简便。（傅霞山）
