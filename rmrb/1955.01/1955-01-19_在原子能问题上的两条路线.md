The Soviet government recently issued a statement announcing that it has not only provided scientific, technical, and industrial assistance to our country, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and the German Democratic Republic in establishing scientific research centers to develop research in nuclear physics and the peaceful uses of atomic energy, but is also prepared to submit a report on the Soviet Union's first industrial atomic power station and its operations to the international conference on the peaceful uses of atomic energy, disseminating the relevant scientific experience accumulated by the Soviet Union.

The statement also said that the Soviet Union is considering expanding the scope of countries it can assist in the development of scientific research and experiments for the peaceful uses of atomic energy.

This is a great initiative in human history. It marks a new development in international relations and international cooperation in our time. Comrade Malenkov pointed out in his report to the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: "Although the Soviet state has mastered the practical possibility of producing atomic energy, it is eager to use this new type of energy for peaceful purposes and for the happiness of the people, because this use of atomic energy can infinitely expand mankind's control over the spontaneous forces of nature, giving mankind enormous possibilities to improve productivity, advance in technology and culture, and increase social wealth." Now, this great ideal and task is being gradually realized. People can see from the above statement of the Soviet government how much effort the Soviet government has made to develop the peaceful uses of atomic energy.

Facts show that the Soviet Union has consistently strived to ban atomic weapons, eliminate the threat of atomic war, and use atomic energy for peaceful purposes. The proactive and positive attitude taken by the Soviet delegation when the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly adopted the joint proposal on disarmament and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction and the resolution on international cooperation in promoting the peaceful uses of atomic energy was evident to all. The Soviet government's willingness to disseminate information on the Soviet Union's first industrial atomic power station and its operations is even more eloquent proof that the Soviet Union is working to ensure that international cooperation in the peaceful uses of atomic energy can achieve positive results. It is clear that as long as other countries have a sincere desire, it is entirely possible to establish and develop such international cooperation to use atomic energy to improve productivity and benefit the people.

The assistance given by the Soviet government to our country and other people's democratic countries, and the mutual promotion of cooperation in the peaceful uses of atomic energy, will provide a powerful example for potentially expanding international cooperation. The Soviet Union's assistance in this regard is sincere and selfless, with the aim of making the brilliant achievements of human science in atomic energy more widely beneficial to mankind. The Soviet Union has repeatedly stated that international cooperation in the peaceful uses of atomic energy should be based on the principle of preventing the possibility of using this cooperation to undermine the legitimate interests of various countries. International cooperation based on this principle will greatly promote friendly cooperation among countries and consolidate international peace and security. Precisely because of this, the Soviet government's recent statement has immediately aroused great repercussions in public opinion in various countries, and peace-loving people around the world are jubilant about it. The Chinese people and scientists, who have taken their destiny into their own hands, believe that they should redouble their efforts, and with the help and cooperation of the Soviet Union, work closely with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries to fight to the end against atomic war plots and promote international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy.

Today, everyone sees that the Soviet Union has not only mastered the production methods of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and the methods of using atomic energy to produce electricity, but also has the conditions to provide other countries with scientific, technical, and industrial assistance in promoting research on the peaceful uses of atomic energy. This irrefutably proves that Soviet atomic science is at the forefront of the world. The United States' monopoly on atomic energy has long since vanished. However, the warmongering groups in the United States and their followers are still frantically clamoring for atomic war and are intensifying preparations for atomic war. These arrogant actions will only lead to the result of "playing with fire and burning oneself." Recently, Cole, a member of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy of the U.S. Congress, also admitted when talking about the development of atomic energy in the Soviet Union: "A policy of war will bring huge consequences to the United States."

After losing its monopoly on atomic energy in 1947, the U.S. aggressive bloc still wanted to use the myth of so-called "atomic weapons superiority" to intimidate the peace-loving people of the world, desperately opposed the Soviet Union's peaceful initiative to ban atomic weapons, and asserted that atomic energy was not suitable for peaceful purposes. Hafstad, Director of the Reactor Development Group of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Pike, former Acting Chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, and Davidson, an American energy expert, all asserted that unless atomic weapons were produced in large quantities, the use of atomic energy for power equipment would be impossible for decades to come. They tried to obstruct the peaceful uses of atomic energy. The successful construction of the Soviet Union's first industrial atomic power station in June 1954 dealt a fatal blow to the fallacies of the U.S. aggressive bloc's hired scholars. Now, just as the U.S. aggressive bloc is frantically preparing for atomic war, the Soviet government has announced its willingness to disclose to other countries its scientific and technological experience in the peaceful uses of atomic energy, and to provide other countries with scientific, technical, and industrial assistance in promoting research on the peaceful uses of atomic energy. These facts most eloquently prove that only a handful of atomic merchants in the United States are frantically preparing disasters for mankind, while the peaceful and democratic camp led by the Soviet Union is constantly working to benefit mankind!

Recently, it is a well-known fact that the U.S. aggressive bloc is frantically intensifying preparations for atomic war in the East and the West. Not only are warmongering generals in the United States, such as Radford and Stevenson, constantly clamoring for atomic war, but it is particularly noteworthy that the North Atlantic aggressive bloc council, manipulated by the United States, recently approved a plan at the Paris conference to conduct atomic war in Europe, and in fact gave U.S. generals the right to arbitrarily decide to use atomic bombs. And in the London and Paris agreements, it is stipulated that the U.S. aggressive bloc and its followers are preparing to hand over atomic weapons to West German militarists. The U.S. "Christian Science Monitor" revealed on December 20 that "in Europe, Western allies are prepared to openly and unreservedly rely on atomic weapons as the foundation of their strength," which is by no means accidental. The U.S. President also openly stated in the January 6th "State of the Union Address" that in order to accelerate the implementation of its war policy, the United States has not only devoted two-thirds of its annual budget to military expenditures, but also openly clamored to develop and use "new weapons, especially new weapons with rapid and destructive attack power." Eisenhower more specifically stated in the January 17th "Budget Message" that two-thirds of the military budget will "focus on the Air Force and Navy's 'nuclear-air retaliation' power," and announced that the United States' first atomic-powered submarine has been launched. The U.S. aggressive bloc's conspiracy to frantically prepare for atomic war is already impossible to conceal in the slightest.

The U.S. aggressive bloc's criminal activities of openly preparing for atomic war thoroughly violate international conventions, violate humanity and human conscience, and violate the universal aspirations of the people. The principle of prohibiting the use of weapons of mass destruction has been affirmed by the Geneva Protocol signed by the United States in 1925. The relevant resolutions adopted by the first and most recent ninth sessions of the United Nations General Assembly more clearly stipulate that countries have the obligation to seek the prohibition of atomic weapons and promote international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy. But the U.S. aggressive bloc is deliberately throwing these international obligations to the winds. It is desperately pursuing the maximum profits of monopoly capital groups in the atomic arms race, subjecting the people of all countries to an increasing threat of atomic war, and even arrogantly attempting to ultimately plunge humanity into the catastrophe of atomic war. This conspiracy of the U.S. atomic maniacs cannot but arouse the resolute opposition of all peace-loving countries and peoples.

Today, two different paths are laid out before the people of the world: one is the dead end of the U.S. war bloc attempting to prepare for atomic war and plunge humanity into a destructive disaster; the other is the broad road of the Soviet Union using atomic energy for peaceful purposes and implementing international cooperation to promote the comprehensive development of human civilization. These are the two sharply opposed lines unfolding on the atomic energy question. It is obvious that any rational person should choose the correct path indicated by the peace forces led by the Soviet Union. Recently, peace-loving people in various countries have expressed their firm opposition to atomic war. The Japanese people, who have suffered from the disasters of U.S. atomic bombings and hydrogen bomb tests, have shouted the call that "the Hiroshima tragedy must not be repeated," and they have won the support of people all over the world. Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, also pointed out in a statement on January 13 that "the consciousness of the people shows a great strength." We believe that the people of the world will further unite, mobilize, thoroughly expose the U.S. conspiracy to prepare for atomic war, oppose the U.S. atomic arms race, oppose the handing over of atomic weapons to aggressive German militarists, resolutely demand the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs, and support the Soviet Union's great policy of using atomic energy for peaceful purposes and implementing international cooperation, in order to strive for world peace and progress.

    在原子能问题上的两条路线
    苏联政府最近发表声明，宣布苏联政府不仅已经给予我国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚和德意志民主共和国以科学技术和工业上的帮助，来建立科学实验中心，以发展对原子核物理学和原子能和平用途方面的研究；而且准备向讨论和平利用原子能国际会议提出关于苏联第一个原子能工业电力站及其工作情况的报告，传播苏联积累起来的有关的科学经验。
    声明并说，苏联正在考虑在发展原子能和平用途的科学研究和实验方面扩大它所能够援助的国家的范围的问题。
    这是人类历史上的伟大创举。它标志着我们这个时代的国际关系和国际合作事业的崭新的发展。马林科夫同志在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的报告中就曾指出：“苏维埃国家虽然掌握了生产原子能的实际可能性，但亟愿把这种新型的能量用于和平目的，为人民谋幸福，因为这样利用原子能可以无限地扩展人类对自然界自发力量的控制，使人类有巨大的可能来提高生产力，在技术和文化上求进步，并增加社会财富。”现在，这一伟大的理想和任务，正在逐步地实现着。人们从苏联政府的上述声明中可以看到，苏联政府为发展原子能和平用途做了何等重大的努力。
    事实说明，苏联一贯地为禁止原子武器，消除原子战争威胁，使原子能用于和平用途而奋斗不懈。在去年联合国大会第九届会议通过关于裁军和禁止大规模毁灭性武器的问题的联合提案和关于在促进原子能用于和平目的方面进行国际合作的决议的时候，苏联代表团所采取的主动积极的态度，是人所共见的。苏联政府准备传播苏联第一个原子能工业电力站及其工作情况，更雄辩地证明苏联是在努力使原子能和平用途的国际合作能够得到积极的结果。很显然，只要其他国家都有真诚的愿望，那末，建立和发展这种国际合作，使原子能用于提高生产力、造福人民是完全有可能的。
    苏联政府给予我国和其他人民民主国家的帮助和相互促进原子能和平用途方面的合作，将为可能不断扩大的国际合作提供有力的范例。苏联在这方面的帮助，是真诚无私的，目的在于使原子能这一人类科学的辉煌成果能更广泛地为人类造福。苏联曾经一再表明，在原子能用于和平目的方面的国际合作，应当以这样的原则为基础：杜绝利用这种合作来破坏各国合法利益的可能性。基于这个原则之上的国际合作，将大大促进各国的友好合作关系，巩固国际和平和安全。正因为这样，苏联政府最近发表的有关声明，立即在各国公众舆论中引起了巨大的反响，全世界爱好和平的人民为之欢欣鼓舞。掌握了自己的命运的中国人民和科学家们，认为更应该加倍努力，在苏联的帮助和合作下，紧密地与苏联和人民民主各国携手并进，为反对原子战争阴谋、促进和平利用原子能的国际合作而奋斗到底。
    今天谁都看到，苏联不仅已经掌握了原子武器和氢武器的生产方法，不仅掌握了利用原子能生产电能的方法，而且已经有条件在促进原子能和平用途的研究方面给予其他国家以科学、技术和工业上的帮助。这就无可置辩地证明了苏联的原子科学已居于世界第一位。美国对原子能的垄断地位早已无影无踪了。但是，美国的好战集团及其追随者却还在疯狂地叫嚣原子战争，并在加紧准备原子战争。他们这种狂妄的行动除了导致“玩火自焚”的结果以外，是不会有别的结果的。最近，美国国会两院原子能委员会委员柯尔在谈到苏联的原子能发展情况时也承认：“战争政策将为美国招致巨大的后果”。
    在一九四七年失掉了原子能的垄断地位以后，美国侵略集团依然想用所谓“原子武器优势”的神话来向世界和平人民进行恫吓，拚命反对苏联禁止原子武器的和平倡议，并断言原子能不适宜于和平用途。美国原子能委员会作用器发展组主任哈弗斯塔德、前美国原子能委员会代理主席派克、美国能学专家大卫逊都曾断言，除非大量生产原子武器，利用原子能的动力设备在今后数十年期间将是不可能的。他们力图阻挠原子能的和平用途。一九五四年六月苏联第一个原子能工业电力站的建设成功，给了美国侵略集团的御用学者的这种谬论以致命打击。现在，正当美国侵略集团疯狂准备原子战争的时候，苏联政府宣布准备向其他国家公开它在原子能和平用途方面的科学技术经验，在促进原子能和平用途的研究方面给予其他国家以科学、技术和工业上的帮助。这些事实最雄辩地证明，只有美国的一小撮原子贩子正在那里疯狂地为人类准备灾难，而以苏联为首的和平民主阵营是不断努力为人类谋幸福的！
    最近以来，美国侵略集团在东方和西方正在疯狂地加紧准备原子战争，这是人所共见的事实。不仅美国好战的将军们，如雷德福、史蒂文森之流不断发出原子战争的叫嚣，特别值得注意的是，不久以前美国操纵的北大西洋侵略集团理事会在巴黎会议上批准制订在欧洲进行原子战争的计划，并且在事实上给予美国将领任意决定使用原子弹的权利。而在伦敦和巴黎协定中规定，美国侵略集团及其追随者正准备把原子武器交给西德军国主义分子。美国“基督教科学箴言报”十二月二十日透露说：“在欧洲，西方盟国准备公开地无保留地倚靠原子武器作为它们力量的基础”，这决不是偶然的。美国总统在一月六日的“国情咨文”中也露骨地表示，美国为了加紧推行战争政策，不仅已使军事费用占去全年预算的三分之二，并公然叫嚷要发展和使用“新武器，特别是具有迅速的和毁灭性的攻击力量的新武器”。艾森豪威尔在一月十七日的“预算咨文”中更具体表示，军事预算的三分之二将“侧重于空军和海军的‘核子——空中报复’力量”，并宣布美国第一艘以原子为动力的潜水艇下水。美国侵略集团这种疯狂准备原子战争的阴谋，已经是丝毫不能掩饰的了。
    美国侵略集团公开进行原子战争准备的罪恶活动，彻头彻尾地违反国际公约，违反人道和人类良知，违反人民的普遍愿望。禁止使用大规模毁灭性武器的原则，已为一九二五年美国参加签字的日内瓦议定书所确认。联合国大会第一届和最近的第九届会议上通过的有关决议，更明确地规定各国负有谋求禁止原子武器和促成和平利用原子能的国际合作的义务。但美国侵略集团却蓄意要把这些国际义务抛在九霄云外。它不顾一切地追求垄断资本集团在原子军备竞赛中的最大利润，使各国人民遭到日甚一日的原子战争威胁，甚至狂妄地企图最后把人类投入原子战争的浩劫中去。美国原子狂人的这种阴谋计划，不能不引起一切爱好和平的国家和人民的坚决反对。
    今天，在世界人民的面前摆着两个不同的道路：一个是美国战争集团企图准备原子战争、把人类投入毁灭性灾难的绝路；一个是苏联把原子能用于和平目的并实行国际合作，以促进人类文明全面发展的宽阔道路。这是在原子能问题上所展开的尖锐对立的两条路线。很明显任何一个有理性的人都应该选择以苏联为首的和平力量所指引的正确路线的。最近以来，各国爱好和平人民都表达了他们坚决反对原子战争的意志。曾经遭受美国原子轰炸和氢弹试验的灾难的日本人民，喊出了“广岛事件不能再演”的呼声，他们获得全世界人民的支持。世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里在一月十三日的声明中也指出：“人民的觉悟表现出巨大的力量”。我们相信，全世界人民一定会进一步团结起来，动员起来，彻底揭穿美国准备原子战争的阴谋，反对美国进行原子军备竞赛，反对把原子武器交给侵略成性的德国军国主义手中，坚决要求禁止原子弹和氢弹，拥护苏联把原子能用于和平目的并实行国际合作的伟大政策，以争取全世界的和平和进步。
