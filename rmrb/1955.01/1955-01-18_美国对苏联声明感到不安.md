Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 16th: As can be seen from reports by American and foreign news agencies, the American ruling circles are obviously disturbed by the Soviet government's statement on the German question, fearing that it may have a great impact on Western European public opinion.

    In order to prevent this and reduce the significance of the Soviet proposal, the State Department hurriedly set a tone for Western official propaganda on the 15th through its spokesman, Mr. Sultam. He said that this proposal "merely repeats what Moscow has been saying for some time." He said that the American attitude remains: once the work of ratifying the Paris Accords is completed, negotiations with the Soviet Union will have a more promising prospect. However, the State Department spokesman did not mention in the slightest that the Soviet government's statement emphasized that this claim is completely unfounded and that its purpose is to confuse public opinion so that the Paris Accords can be quickly ratified.

    Some reports by American news agencies on the Soviet government's statement attempt to give a malicious interpretation of the Soviet government's statement. For example, the United Press quoted American authorities as saying that the Soviet Union is not even willing to suggest the unification of Germany now, although the Soviet government's statement clearly stated that in order to solve the German question, the most important and urgent thing is to restore the unification of Germany, and in order to do this, four-power negotiations must be held.

    美国对苏联声明感到不安
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社纽约十六日讯：从美国和外国通讯社消息可以看出，美国统治集团对苏联政府关于德国问题的声明感到明显的不安，担心它可能对西欧舆论产生很大的影响。
    为了防止这一点和缩小苏联建议的意义，国务院连忙在十五日通过它的发言人苏丹姆为西方的官方宣传定了一个调子。他说，这个建议“仅仅是把莫斯科一些时候以来一直在说的话重复了一遍”。他说，美国的态度仍然是 ：一旦批准巴黎协定的工作完成，同苏联的谈判就有了较有希望的前景。但是，国务院发言人丝毫没有谈到，苏联政府的声明中强调指出，这种说法是完全没有根据的，它的目的是迷惑舆论，以使巴黎协定迅速获得批准。
    美国通讯社关于苏联政府声明的一些报道，企图对苏联政府的声明作一种别有用心的解释。例如，合众社援引美国权威人士的话说，苏联甚至在现在还不愿意建议统一德国，虽然苏联政府的声明中清楚地说明了，为要解决德国问题，最重要和迫切的事情就是恢复德国的统一，而为要做到这点，就必须举行四国谈判。
