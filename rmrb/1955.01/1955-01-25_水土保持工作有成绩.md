    Soil and water conservation work in Yishui County, Shandong Province, has achieved results. Yishui County is located near Yishan and Mengshan Mountains and is the source of the Shu River. Due to the destruction of forests over the years, coupled with the poverty of the farmers who were unable to repair terraced fields, severe soil erosion occurred every rainy summer and autumn. This not only caused the river channels and fertile fields in the upper reaches of the Shu River to be silted up, but also brought disasters to the people in the lower reaches of northern Jiangsu. Since 1950, the people of Yishui County have carried out large-scale soil and water conservation work. By the end of last year, more than 600 mountain gullies had been dammed, more than 27,900 water-slowing dams had been built, and more than 280,000 mu of mountains had been closed for afforestation. This has deepened the river channels in the upper reaches of the Shu River; villages along the Shu River that were threatened by floods in the past have begun to escape the threat of floods. The floods in June 1937 caused havoc to villages such as Zhangmazhuang and Rencun; however, last year's floods were much larger than those in June 1937, but these villages did not suffer from flood disasters. Furthermore, closing mountains for afforestation has also brought great benefits to the masses. (Our Shandong Reporter Station)

    水土保持工作有成绩
    山东省沂水县水土保持工作获得了成绩。沂水县地势靠沂山和蒙山，是沭河的发源地。由于历年来山林的破坏，加以农民生活贫困无力修整梯田，每在多雨的夏秋间，水土流失非常严重，这不仅使沭河上游的河道和良田被冲淤，同时也给下游苏北地区人民带来了灾害。从一九五○年起，沂水县人民就大规模地开展了水土保持工作。到去年底止，共已修筑闸山沟六百余条，缓水坝两万七千九百多座，封山造林二十八万余亩。这使沭河上游的河道刷深了；过去沭河沿岸遭受洪水威胁的村庄，也开始摆脱了洪水的威胁。一九三七年六月间的洪水曾使张马庄、仁村等村庄遭受过浩劫；但是去年的洪水比一九三七年六月的洪水大得多，这些村庄却没有遭受到洪水灾害。并且封山造林也使群众获得了很大的利益。　（本报山东记者站）
