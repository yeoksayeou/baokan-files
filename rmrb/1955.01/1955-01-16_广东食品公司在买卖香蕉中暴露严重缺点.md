    Guangdong Food Company Exposes Serious Shortcomings in Banana Trading

    To the Editor:

    Guangdong had a bumper banana harvest last year, with production increasing by about 20% compared to 1953. However, due to serious shortcomings in the Guangdong Food Company's management of the banana business, state property suffered undue losses.

    The Guangdong Food Company implemented a "key procurement" system in major banana-producing areas within the province, prohibiting private merchants from operating. However, they did not accurately assess production, and the procurement plan was too small. In Dongguan alone, as of early October, 198,000 dan of bananas had already been procured, exceeding the original estimated market volume by 120%. Under these circumstances, they couldn't refuse to buy (because the procurement had already been announced), but they couldn't store or transport them either. As of mid-October, Guangzhou City had a stockpile of 2.5 million jin of bananas, with large quantities deteriorating daily. According to preliminary statistics, more than 100,000 jin of bananas rotted or spoiled from June to October, and the total loss, including reduced-price sales, was over 2 billion yuan. Similar operational losses in the key production area of Dongguan County also reached 2 billion yuan.

    The food company also failed to seriously investigate the actual agricultural production costs and changes in supply and demand patterns when setting procurement prices. In early June last year, the procurement price was 83,000 yuan per dan. Compared with the actual production cost, the profit from growing one mu of bananas was five times higher than that of rice paddies, which led farmers to develop the idea of "valuing bananas over rice," blindly expanding planting areas and affecting rice production. In early August, due to the surge in market volume, the price was reduced to 75,000 yuan per dan in order to control procurement, then further reduced to 68,000 yuan on September 10, and even further to 60,000 yuan on October 2. With such repeated price reductions, farmers feared losses and sold unripe bananas early.

    The Guangdong Food Company also adopted despicable deceptive tactics towards brother enterprises. In terms of transfer prices, their approach was to "increase transfer prices quickly when procurement prices rise, and delay lowering transfer prices when procurement prices fall"; the practice of using lower-quality bananas as higher-quality bananas and raising the grading for pricing was also very common in transfer pricing. They also arbitrarily increased profit margins and falsely reported expenses, increasing costs. These all caused undue losses to brother enterprises.

    When transporting bananas out of Guangdong, the Guangdong Food Company also frequently adopted the erroneous practice of "replacing good ones with bad ones and ignoring the consequences." Even if the bananas had deteriorated, they were still loaded onto the train, "preferring to let the bananas rot on the train rather than in Guangzhou." For example, on September 18, 212 pieces of bananas were loaded, and the representative of the receiving unit in Shanghai believed that the quality was too poor and requested to replace them with good goods, but the food company still loaded them, resulting in a loss of nearly one-quarter upon arrival in Shanghai. According to preliminary inspections, among the ten batches of bananas transported out from July 14 to September 18, the lowest loss rate in transit was the batch transported to Suzhou, reaching 35.5%, the highest reached 75%, and generally also around 40% to 50%.

    The capitalist thinking of the Guangdong Food Company in the banana business has already brought serious consequences to its work. They must resolutely correct this error in future work to avoid bringing greater losses to the country.

### 广东食品公司在买卖香蕉中暴露严重缺点

    广东食品公司在买卖香蕉中暴露严重缺点编辑同志：
    广东去年香蕉丰产，产量较一九五三年约增百分之二十，但是由于广东省食品公司经营香蕉业务的工作有严重的缺点，致使国家财产受到不应有的损失。
    广东省食品公司在省内重点产区实行了“重点包购”，不准私商经营。但他们对产量摸底不清，收购计划偏小。仅东莞一地至十月初即已收购香蕉十九万八千担，大于原来估计上市量百分之一百二十。在这种情况下，不收不行（因为已经宣布了包购），收了也放不下、调不出。截至十月中旬，广州市库存香蕉达二百五十万斤，每天大量积压变质，据初步统计，六月到十月坏了和烂了的香蕉十多万斤，连同削价出售损失总共约在二十亿元以上。重点产区东莞县这种经营损失也达二十亿元。
    食品公司在拟定收购价格时，也没有认真调查农业真实生产成本和产销规律变化。去年六月初，每担收购价是八万三千元，同实际生产成本比较，种蕉一亩的利润高于稻田五倍，从而使农民滋长了“重蕉轻稻”思想，盲目发展种植面积，影响了稻谷增产。八月上旬，由于上市量猛，为了控制收购，就将价格降到七万五千元一担，九月十日再降到六万八千元，十月二日更降到六万元。这样价格一降再降，农民怕受损失，就将没有成熟的香蕉早斩早卖。
    广东省食品公司对待兄弟企业还采取了恶劣的欺骗手段。在调拨价上，他们采取的办法是“收购价涨，调拨价提得快，收购价落，调拨价下降拖延”；在调拨作价中，以下蕉充上蕉，提级计价现象也很普遍。他们还擅自提高利润率和虚报费用、加大成本。这些，都使兄弟企业受到了不应有的损失。
    广东省食品公司在香蕉外调时，也经常采取“以坏顶好，推出不管”的错误做法。香蕉虽已变质，但仍装运上车，“宁可香蕉烂在车上，不让坏在广州”。如九月十八日装出香蕉二百十二件，上海的受货单位代表认为品质太差，请换好货，但食品公司仍然装出，结果货到上海损失了将近四分之一。据初步检查，自七月十四日起至九月十八日止，前后外运的十批香蕉中间，在途损耗率最低的是运苏州的一批，达百分之三十五点五，最高的达到百分之七十五，一般也在百分之四十到五十左右。
    广东省食品公司在经营香蕉业务中的资本主义思想，已经给工作带来了严重的恶果。他们必须在今后工作中坚决纠正这种错误，以免为国家带来更大损失。　智康
