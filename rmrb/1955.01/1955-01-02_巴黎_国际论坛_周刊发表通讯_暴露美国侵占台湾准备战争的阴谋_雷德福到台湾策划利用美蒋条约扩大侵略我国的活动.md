Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 31st: The Paris "International Forum" weekly, published on December 3rd, carried a Taiwan dispatch saying: It is no secret to anyone that the US National Security Council recently met and discussed almost entirely how to utilize the Chinese Kuomintang and Taiwan in the global struggle against communism.

"Western Enterprises Corporation" (a strange commercial organization apparently set up to cover up espionage) is already on a war footing. To strengthen the Seventh Fleet, the 45,000-ton aircraft carrier "Midway" and sixteen torpedo boats, currently part of the Atlantic Fleet, are expected to arrive soon.

The dispatch said: All of the Kuomintang's military resources are currently mobilized and completely controlled by the US delegation. In fact, Chiang Kai-shek's army has become a US mercenary force. Chiang Kai-shek and some of his politicians often receive various and contradictory requests from American advisors. The fact is that in Taiwan, the US representatives are diplomats on the one hand and businessmen on the other, and they are sometimes completely preoccupied with their personal business dealings.

The dispatch said: Taiwan has all kinds of American delegations. Among these delegations, one represents Defense Secretary Wilson and General Motors, one represents General Eisenhower and appliance manufacturers, one represents Admiral Radford, and another represents airline companies, etc. These delegations compete for benefits to the point that any measures taken have to go through official channels, sending dozens of private telegrams to the United States to tell the leaders of the "China Lobby" to support or prepare to veto such measures. The real political activities of the Chiang government are thus concentrated in Washington's "China Lobby".

Xinhua News Agency, December 31st: After a series of "visits" to Southeast Asia, US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford arrived in Taiwan on the 30th. Radford told reporters that he was in Taiwan to pave the way for the recently signed US-Chiang treaty.

On the day of his arrival in Taipei, Radford began holding meetings and talks with the heads of US military and political institutions in Taiwan and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. Radford said that he would "solve all the common problems that we can solve." According to foreign news agencies' prior disclosures, Radford will plot to strengthen the US military occupation of Taiwan, expand military aggression against China, including expanding the scope of direct US military occupation of China's coastal islands. Agence France-Presse said that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is preparing to discuss a "comprehensive military plan" with Radford.

Radford's activities along the way of this round-the-world "trip" from West to East show that his central purpose is to strengthen US military aggression deployment. Taiwan is one of the focal points of Radford's "visit." He not only continued to clamor against the Chinese people but also repeatedly advocated piecing together the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, Japan, and the Syngman Rhee clique into a Northeast Asian aggressive bloc. Radford's activities show that the United States is stepping up the use of the US-Chiang treaty to expand its war threats against China, and also show that this treaty is closely linked to the entire US aggression plan.

    巴黎“国际论坛”周刊发表通讯
    暴露美国侵占台湾准备战争的阴谋
    雷德福到台湾策划利用美蒋条约扩大侵略我国的活动
    【新华社柏林三十一日电】十二月三日出版的巴黎“国际论坛”周刊刊载的台湾通讯说：这对于任何人来说都已经不是秘密：美国国家安全委员会最近开会时，几乎完全是讨论如何在全世界的反对共产主义斗争中利用中国国民党和台湾的问题。
  “西方企业公司”（显然是为了掩护特务而组织的奇怪的商业机关）已经处在战争的基础上。为了加强第七舰队，预料还有四万五千吨的航空母舰“中途号”和十六艘鱼雷艇不久就会到来，这些舰只目前是大西洋部队的一部分。
    通讯说：国民党的全部军事资源目前都已动员，并且完全控制在美国代表团的手里。实际上，蒋介石的军队已经成为美国的雇佣兵。蒋介石和他的一些政客们常常接到美国顾问们的各式各样的和互相矛盾的要求。事实是：在台湾，美国的代表们一方面是外交人员，一方面又是商人，他们有时完全忙于他们私人的生意经。
    通讯说：台湾有着各式各样的美国代表团。在这些代表团中，一个是代表国防部长威尔逊和通用汽车公司的，一个是代表艾森豪威尔将军和电器用具制造商的，一个是代表雷德福海军上将的，还有一个是代表航空运输公司的等等。这些代表团为了争夺利益，以至采取任何措施都得通过官方途径拍上几十封私人电报到美国去告诉“院外援华集团”的领袖们，请他们支持这种措施，或准备否决它。蒋政府的真正政治活动就是这样集中在华盛顿的
  “院外援华集团”。
    【新华社三十一日讯】美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福在东南亚地区进行了一连串的“访问”活动后，三十日到达台湾。雷德福对新闻记者说：他到台湾是为实行最近签订的美蒋条约铺平道路。
    雷德福到达台北的当天，就开始同驻台湾的美国军政机构的首脑和蒋介石卖国集团举行会议和会谈。雷德福说，他将要“解决凡是我们能够解决的共同问题”。据外国通讯社在事先透露，雷德福将策划加强美国对台湾的军事占领，扩大对中国的军事侵略，包括扩大美国对中国沿海岛屿实行直接军事占领的范围。法新社说，蒋介石卖国集团准备把一个“全面的军事计划”和雷德福进行讨论。
    雷德福这次从西方到东方的环球“旅行”的沿途活动表明，他的中心目的在于加强美国的军事侵略部署。台湾是雷德福
  “访问”的重点之一。他不仅继续叫嚣反对中国人民，并且一再鼓吹撮合蒋介石卖国集团、日本和李承晚集团拼凑成东北亚侵略集团。雷德福的活动说明美国已在加紧利用美蒋条约扩大对中国的战争威胁，同时也说明，这个条约是同整个的美国侵略计划密切联系的。
