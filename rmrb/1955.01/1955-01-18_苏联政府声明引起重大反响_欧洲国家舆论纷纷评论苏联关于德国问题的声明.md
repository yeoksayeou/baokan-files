    Soviet Government Statement Provokes Major Repercussions
    —European Countries' Public Opinion Comments on Soviet Statement on the German Question
    German Democratic Republic
    Berlin's democratic newspapers all published the full text of the Soviet government's statement on the German question on the front page with banner headlines. "Neues Deutschland" emphasized in the headline that the Paris Accords increase the danger of war, and that the Soviet Union proposes holding a four-power conference to discuss the restoration of German unity on the basis of free elections. The headline of "Berliner Zeitung" was: "Soviet Union Proposes Free Elections." The headline of "Neue Zeit" was: "The German People Must Make Their Own Decision."
    West Germany
    West Berlin newspapers also attached great importance to the Soviet government's statement. "Welt am Sonntag" published the full text of the final conclusion of the Soviet government's statement on the 16th and emphasized in the headline that the Soviet Union is willing to normalize its relations with the Federal Republic of Germany. The newspaper particularly emphasized the Soviet statement's point that it is necessary to hold a four-power conference to discuss the reunification of Germany through free elections, and that the ratification of the Paris Accords would make such negotiations useless and impossible. "Telegraf" also published a message on the Soviet government's statement on the front page. The Christian Democratic Union's "Der Tag" published a detailed report on the Soviet government's statement under the headline "Moscow's New Statement on the German Question." The newspaper expressed dissatisfaction with the statement because it was directed against the Paris Accords.
    In addition, Hamburg Radio broadcast a detailed summary of the Soviet government's statement on January 15. The radio station focused on broadcasting the part of the statement concerning the German people having to choose the path of future development. According to the radio station, Bonn political circles believe that the Soviet government's statement will be of particular significance because it was not presented to Western countries in the form of a note, but directly addresses the Federal Government and the German people.
    According to an Associated Press correspondent in Bonn, Fritz Heine, Director of the Press and Information Department of the German Social Democratic Party, said that the Soviet government's statement once again proves that Western countries should hold negotiations with the Soviet Union before ratifying the agreement on rearming West Germany. "The Soviet proposal for normalizing relations with West Germany should be carefully studied."
    According to a report by the West German news agency Deutsche Presse-Agentur, Herbert Wehner, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the West German Bundestag and a member of the Social Democratic Party, stated, "The new Soviet proposal provides the possibility for the four major powers to negotiate on the German question." Wehner emphasized: "Neither the three Western powers nor the Federal Government can reject such negotiations." Wehner added that, in any case, "it would be much better to start negotiations now than to exacerbate the contradictions."
    England
    The British "Sunday Times" published a summary of the Soviet government's statement in a prominent position on the front page, with the large headline: "Soviet Proposal on Germany. Free Elections Under Supervision Possible If Paris Accords Rejected." The "Sunday Times" diplomatic correspondent wrote: "In order to prevent the realization of the Paris Accords, the Soviet Union is more committed than ever to proposing genuine, free elections for all of Germany." The commentator continued: Judging from the statement, "it breaks away from the deadlock of the Berlin Conference held last February, and to a considerable extent this statement is a temptation for the Germans."
    "The Observer" briefly published the statement without comment. The BBC summarized the statement in a news broadcast on the 15th.
    France
    The French "L'Humanité Dimanche" published a detailed summary of the Soviet statement. The small headlines of the summary are: "Ratification of the Paris Accords Would Make the Restoration of German Unity Impossible"; "It is Possible to Reach an Agreement on Holding Free Elections in All of Germany"; "The German People Must Make a Choice"; "Four-Power Talks Must Be Held." "Le Dimanche" listed several "key points" from the Soviet government's statement.
    Austria
    Austrian newspapers reported in detail on the Soviet government's statement on the 16th. The "Österreichische Volksstimme" emphasized in its headline that the Germans themselves should decide the fate of their homeland. "Neues Österreich" paid particular attention to the Soviet government's statement that the normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany would help restore German unity.
    Finland
    Many Helsinki morning newspapers published the Soviet statement in a prominent position on the 16th. The headline of "Helsingin Sanomat" pointed out that if the Paris Accords are not ratified, the Soviet Union is prepared to establish normal relations with the Federal Republic of Germany. The newspaper emphasized quoting the second and third points of the conclusion of the statement. "Suomen Sosialidemokraatti" quoted the last paragraph of the statement, emphasizing the Soviet Union's desire to establish normal relations with the Federal Republic of Germany.
    Yugoslavia
    Yugoslavian "Borba" and "Politika" published summaries of the Soviet government's statement. The headline of "Borba" was: "The Soviet Union Suggests to Western Countries to Hold Negotiations on the Restoration of German Unity. The Soviet government may agree to hold free elections throughout Germany, as long as no part of Germany participates in a military alliance with other countries." The headline of "Politika" emphasized that "the Soviet Union is willing to normalize its relations with West Germany if the Paris Accords are not ratified."

    苏联政府声明引起重大反响
    ——欧洲国家舆论纷纷评论苏联关于德国问题的声明
    民主德国
    柏林民主报纸都在第一版以通栏标题刊载了苏联政府关于德国问题的声明的全文。“新德意志报”在标题中强调指出：巴黎协定增加战争的危险，苏联建议举行讨论在自由选举的基础上恢复德国统一问题的四国会议。“柏林日报”的标题是：“苏联建议自由选举”。“新时报”的标题是：“德国人民必须自己作出决定”。
    西　德
    西柏林各报也非常重视苏联政府的声明。“星期日世界报”十六日全文登载了苏联政府声明中最后的结论并在标题中强调指出：苏联愿意使它和德意志联邦共和国的关系正常化。这家报纸特别强调了苏联声明中所指出的有必要举行四国会议讨论通过举行自由选举重新统一德国的问题，以及批准巴黎协定将使这种谈判成为无用的而且是不可能的。“电讯报”也在头版登载了关于苏联政府声明的消息。基督教民主联盟的“日报”以“莫斯科关于德国问题的新声明”为标题刊载了一篇关于苏联政府声明的详细的报道。这家报纸对这篇声明表示不满，因为它是针对巴黎协定的。
    此外，汉堡电台一月十五日广播了苏联政府声明的详细摘要。这个电台着重转播了声明中关于德国人民必须就今后发展的途径进行选择的部分。据这个电台报道，波恩政界人士认为苏联政府的这个声明将有特别的意义，因为它不是以照会的形式向西方国家提出的，而是直接对联邦政府和德国人民讲话。
    据美联社驻波恩记者报道，德国社会民主党新闻及宣传部主任弗里茨·海尼说，苏联政府的声明再一次证明西方国家应当在批准关于重新武装西德的协定之前同苏联举行谈判，“苏联所提关于同西德关系正常化的建议应当加以仔细研究。”
    另据西德德意志新闻社消息，西德联邦议院外交委员会主席、社会民主党议员赫伯特·维涅尔声明说，“苏联的新建议提供了四大国就德国问题进行谈判的可能。”维涅尔着重指出：“不论是三个西方大国还是联邦政府都不能拒绝这种谈判。”维涅尔又说，无论如何“现在就开始谈判将比使矛盾更加尖锐化要好得多”。
    英　国
    英国“星期日泰晤士报”在第一版的显著地位摘要刊载了苏联政府的声明，它的大标题是：“苏联关于德国的建议。如果拒绝批准巴黎协定，就可以在监督下举行自由选举。”“星期日泰晤士报”外交评论员写道：“为了阻止巴黎协定的实现，苏联比任何时候都更为致力于提出真正的全德自由选举。”评论员继续说：根据声明判断，“这个声明脱开了去年二月举行的柏林会议的僵局，这个声明在颇大的程度上对于德国人是一个诱惑。”
    “观察家报”简要地刊载了这个声明，没有加以评论。英国广播公司十五日在新闻广播中摘要报道了这个声明。
    法　国
    法国“人道报星期日刊”登载了苏联声明的详细摘要。摘要的小标题是：“批准巴黎协定将使恢复德国的统一成为不可能”；“就举行全德自由选举达成协议是可能的”；“德国人民必须作出选择”；“必须举行四国会谈”。“星期周报”列举了苏联政府声明中的几个“要点”。
    奥地利
    奥地利报纸十六日详细报道了苏联政府的声明。“奥地利人民之声”报在标题中着重指出，应当由德国人自己来决定自己祖国的命运。“新奥地利”特别重视苏联政府声明中所指出的苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间关系的正常化将有助于恢复德国统一。
    芬　兰
    赫尔辛基许多晨报十六日都以显著地位刊载苏联声明。“赫尔辛基新闻”的标题指出，如果不批准巴黎协定，苏联就准备和德意志联邦共和国建立正常的关系。这家报纸着重引述了声明的结论的第二点和第三点。“芬兰社会民主主义者”报引证声明中的最后一段，着重指出苏联对和德意志联邦共和国建立正常关系的愿望。
    南斯拉夫
    南斯拉夫“战斗报”和“政治报”摘要刊载了苏联政府的声明。“战斗报”的标题是：“苏联向西方国家建议举行关于恢复德国统一的谈判。苏联政府可能同意在全德范围内举行自由选举，只要德国的任何一部分都不参加同其他国家的军事联盟”。“政治报”在标题中着重指出“苏联愿意使它同西德的关系正常化，如果不批准巴黎协定的话”。
