    The Firm Strides of Communist Builders
    -- The Soviet People on the Economic and Cultural Construction Fronts
    Production Achievements in the First Week of This Year
    Soviet workers achieved great successes in production during the first week of 1955.
    In the coal mining industry, several new mines commenced production at the beginning of this year. In the Kamensk region of the Russian Federation, six mines began producing coal at the beginning of the New Year, three to four months ahead of the original plan. Another five mines have been prepared for commencement of production. In the Voroshilovgrad region of Ukraine, four new mines shipped their first batches of coal in the New Year. The No. 12 "Mikhailov" mine in the Donets coalfield was put into production on January 5, with an estimated annual coal production capacity of over one million tons.
    In the petroleum industry, the petroleum industry workers of the Azerbaijan Republic and the Kazakh Republic overfulfilled their production tasks for this week. The Uzbek Republic completed the drilling of an exploration well with a depth of 1,940 meters ahead of schedule on January 7.
    In the machine industry, a machine tool manufacturing factory in Kharkiv, Ukraine, manufactured a new type of rocker arm grinding machine for processing water turbine blades. Machine tool manufacturers in Moscow completed the installation of an automatic transfer device for machine tools for the tractor industry during this week.
    Metallurgical workers in the Urals, Siberia, the Dnieper region, Donbass, and Kazakhstan also overproduced many products in the first few days of the New Year.
    Laying Railways and Highways in Reclaimed Areas
    A large-scale plan to build railways and highways has begun to be implemented in the reclaimed areas of eastern and southeastern Soviet Union.
    In the reclaimed areas of the Kazakh Republic, it is planned to build more than 2,000 kilometers of railways and 2,600 kilometers of highways. Construction has already begun on many sections. Thousands of workers, engineers, and technicians are building railway roadbeds along the railway lines. Fifteen survey teams are conducting surveying work. In the areas where highways are being built, twelve more machine road construction stations have recently been added, equipped with hundreds of crawler tractors, graders, scrapers, bulldozers, excavators, automobiles, fifty-four mobile power stations, and other road construction machinery and equipment. This year, a total of six million cubic meters of earthwork will be carried out on the highway lines, and one million cubic meters of crushed stone will be laid for road construction.
    Reclaimed areas such as the Altai Territory, Krasnoyarsk Territory, Novosibirsk Oblast, Omsk Oblast, and Tyumen Oblast are about to begin the construction of wide asphalt highways with a total length of more than 2,000 kilometers. At present, the design and route survey work for the highways are underway, and the design work for the three trunk lines in the Altai Territory has been completed. The first phase of highway construction will be completed before this year's autumn harvest. These new highways will connect the most remote areas of these reclaimed areas with the Siberian railway trunk lines. A large number of agricultural machines and equipment will be transported from here to the reclaimed areas, and agricultural products from the reclaimed areas will also be transported out along these highways.
    Eleven Thousand Stores Opened in a Year
    In the past year, about 11,000 new stores have been opened in towns and villages across the Soviet Union.
    Many large food stores and department stores have been opened in Moscow, Leningrad, Rostov, Chelyabinsk, Tbilisi, Dnepropetrovsk, and other major industrial centers in the Soviet Union. In Moscow alone, 110 new stores have been opened, most of which are located on the ground floors of newly built apartment buildings. A large department store recently opened in Gorky City is located in a four-story building with more than 200 salespersons.
    A large number of new stores have been set up in the industrial zones of major cities and reclaimed areas. Fifty new stores have been opened in the industrial zone of Yerevan, the capital of Armenia. In the first half of last year, the consumer cooperative system opened more than 6,000 stores in rural areas, of which about 600 stores were located in reclaimed areas.
    Expanding Television Broadcasting Stations and Promoting Color Television
    Xinhua News Agency: A.V. Chelenkov, Deputy Minister of the Soviet Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, recently told TASS reporters that the Soviet television industry is becoming an indispensable part of people's lives.
    Chelenkov said that at present, television broadcasting stations have been established in Moscow, Kiev, and Leningrad. These television stations broadcast various programs to workers in these cities and nearby rural areas and workers' residential areas six times a week. These programs include dramas, movies, and music programs, as well as speeches by scientists, writers, and innovators in industrial and agricultural production. Television broadcasting stations in Riga, Kharkiv, and Kalinin have been completed and have begun broadcasting.
    Currently, television broadcasting stations are being built in Minsk, Sverdlovsk, and Tallinn. They will be completed this year. Television broadcasting stations in Baku and Tashkent are also under construction. Television broadcasting stations in Gorky, Kuibyshev, Tbilisi, and other cities are about to begin construction, and preparatory work is currently underway.
    Chelenkov said that the production of Soviet televisions is constantly increasing. In 1954 alone, 325,000 televisions were manufactured. More than 700,000 will be manufactured in 1955. The Soviet Union attaches great importance to improving the quality of televisions. At present, Soviet industry is already capable of manufacturing new televisions with larger screens, and the cost of these televisions has been reduced compared to the past.
    Chelenkov also said that the Moscow television broadcasting station has installed a set of experimental equipment and broadcasts color television programs twice a week. Soviet industry has manufactured the first batch of "Rainbow" televisions, which are specifically designed to receive color television programs.

    共产主义建设者的坚定步伐
    ——苏联人民在经济和文化建设战线上
    今年第一个星期的生产成就
    苏联工人在一九五五年的第一个星期在生产上获得了巨大的成就。
    在煤矿工业方面，今年年初又有几个新矿井开工生产。俄罗斯联邦的卡门斯克州有六个矿井在新年开始产煤，比原来计划提早了三个月到四个月。另外还有五个矿井已经为开工进行了准备。乌克兰伏罗希洛夫格勒州的四个新矿井在新年里已经运出了第一批煤。顿尼兹煤区的十二号“米哈伊洛夫”矿井已经在一月五日投入生产，这个矿井的每年采煤量估计在一百万吨以上。
    在石油工业方面，阿塞拜疆共和国和哈萨克共和国的石油工业工作人员超额完成了这个星期的生产任务。乌兹别克共和国在一月七日已经提前完成了一口探井的钻进工作，钻进深度达到一千九百四十公尺。
    在机器工业方面，乌克兰哈尔科夫城的机床制造工厂制造了一种为加工水轮机叶片用的新式摇臂磨床。莫斯科的机床制造业在这一个星期内为拖拉机工业完成了一个机床的自动传送装置的安装工作。
    乌拉尔、西伯利亚、第聂伯河沿岸地带、顿巴斯以及哈萨克的冶金工作者，在新年的头几天内也超计划生产了许多产品。
    把铁路和公路铺在开垦地区
    一个庞大的修建铁路和公路的计划已经在苏联东部和东南部开垦地区开始执行了。
    哈萨克共和国开垦地区已经计划好要修筑二千多公里的铁路和二千六百公里的公路。现在，许多地段已经开始施工了。成千上万的工人、工程师和技师正在各铁路线上建筑铁路路基。十五个勘察队正在进行勘察工作。在建筑公路的地区，最近增设了十二个机器筑路站，配备了成百的履带式拖拉机、平路机、铲土机、推土机、挖土机、汽车，五十四个流动发电站和其他筑路用的机器设备。今年，各公路线上总共要进行六百万公方的土方工程，铺公路用的碎石将达到一百万公方。
    阿尔泰边疆区、克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边疆区、新西伯利亚州、鄂木斯克州、邱门州等开垦地区，即将开始修建长达两千公里以上的宽大的柏油公路。目前，公路的设计和线路勘察工作正在进行，其中阿尔泰边疆区的三条干线的设计工作已经完成。第
  一期的公路建筑工程将在今年秋收以前完工。这些新公路将把这些开垦地区的最边远区域和西伯利亚各铁路干线联系起来。大批农业机器和设备将从这里运到开垦区，开垦区的农产品也将沿着这些公路运送出来。
    一年开设了一万一千个商店
    在过去一年中，苏联各城镇和农村共开设了约一万一千个新商店。
    在莫斯科、列宁格勒、罗斯托夫、车里雅宾斯克、第比利斯、第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克和苏联其他大工业中心，已经开设了许多大的食品商店和百货商店。单是在莫斯科就开设了一百一十个新商店，这些商店多半设在新建的公寓房屋的底层。高尔基城最近开设的一家大百货公司就设立在一座四层楼的建筑物内。这个百货公司共有两百多个售货员。
    大批新的商店设在大城市的工业区和开垦地区。在亚美尼亚首都埃里温的工业区，已经开设了五十个新商店。在去年上半年内，消费合作社系统在农村中共开设了六千多个商店，其中约有六百个商店设在开垦地区。
    扩大电视播送站和推广彩色电视
    苏联邮电部副部长阿·维·切连科夫最近对塔斯社记者发表谈话，指出苏联电视事业正在成为人民生活中不可缺少的部分。
    切连科夫说，现在，莫斯科、基辅和列宁格勒都设有电视播送站。这些电视站每星期中有六次向这些城市和近郊农村、工人住宅区的劳动者播送各种节目。其中包括戏剧、电影和音乐节目，以及科学家、作家、工农业生产革新者的讲话。里加、哈尔科夫和加里宁城的电视播送站已经落成并且开始播送了。
    目前，明斯克、斯维德洛夫斯克和塔林正在建筑电视播送站。它们将在今年落成。巴库和塔什干的电视播送站也在建造中。高尔基、古比雪夫、第比利斯和其他城市的电视播送站即将兴工建筑，现在正在进行准备工作。
    切连科夫说，苏联电视机的产量正在不断增加。仅在一九五四年制造的电视机就有三十二万五千个。一九五五年还将制造七十多万个。苏联十分重视改进电视机的质量。现在，苏联工业已经能够制造有更大的银幕的新式电视机，而且这些电视机的成本都比过去的减低了。
    切连科夫又说，莫斯科的电视播送站已经装置了一套试验性的设备，每周放送两次彩色电视节目。苏联工业已经制造出第一批“虹霓”牌电视机，专门用来收看彩色电视节目。　（据新华社讯）
