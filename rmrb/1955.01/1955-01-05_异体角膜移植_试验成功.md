Following the successful “corneal transplantation” experiment at the Ophthalmology Department of Liuzhou Municipal People's Hospital in Guangxi Province, many patients from various regions have sought treatment. However, the scarcity of cadaver eyeballs makes it difficult to meet the patients' needs. Doctors Xu Yan'an and Tang Jidao conceived the idea of experimenting with monkey corneas. They first removed monkey eyeballs for dissection and observation, discovering that their shape and size were very similar to those of young children. On May 31st and June 21st of last year, they transplanted human corneas onto the corneas of two monkeys in succession. The results showed that while the grafts and the base healed well, the grafts appeared milky white and cloudy. One of the monkeys was observed for more than four months, but the procedure remained ineffective. Later, inspired by watching a Michurin film, they further analyzed the relationship between apes and humans. They believed that transplanting monkey corneas onto human eyes required first changing their nature. Therefore, after removing the monkey cornea, they cultured it with the recipient's serum, allowing the monkey cornea to absorb nutrients from the human serum after severing its original source of nourishment, thus bringing it closer to human characteristics. They believed that this approach was in line with Michurin's principle that "the recipient must change the nature of the transplant to make it compatible with its own metabolism."

On October 21st, another experiment began. This time, the monkey eyeball was first removed and placed in the recipient's serum for culture. After three or four days, the monkey cornea was then transplanted onto the human cornea. This was done successively on three patients, Pan Yongjie, Mo Shaocheng, and Ding Jiasheng. The results showed excellent healing, and the corneas became transparent, with all three blind individuals experiencing varying degrees of vision restoration.

The success of the "heterologous corneal transplantation" experiment not only opens up new sources of corneal material to better meet the needs of patients, but also demonstrates the creative application of Michurin's theory to medicine, holding significant importance for medical research.

    “异体角膜移植”试验成功
    广西省柳州市立人民医院眼科试验“角膜移植术”成功后，各地患者求医的很多。可是，由于尸体眼球缺乏，很难满足患者的需要。徐延安、唐继道医师就想到用猴子的角膜来试验。他们首先把猴子的眼球取下来解剖观察，发现其外形大小与幼儿很相似。去年五月三十一日和六月二十一日，他们先后两次把人的角膜移植到两只猴子的角膜上。结果，虽然移植片与基地都能良好愈合，但移植片上却呈磁白色混浊，其中有一个猴子观察了四个多月仍然无效。后来，他们从看米丘林电影中得到启发，又对猿和人的关系作了进一步的分析。认为把猴子的角膜移植到人的眼上，应先要改变它的本质。于是取下猴子的角膜后，经过用受片人的血清培养，使猴子的角膜在断绝了本质的营养后，吸收人血清的养料，向人的方向接近。他们认为这样做是符合米丘林的“接受体必须改变移植体的性质，使它合乎自己的新陈代谢”的规律的。
    十月二十一日，又一次试验开始了。这次首先取出猴子的眼球放在受片人的血清里培养，经过三、四天后，才把猴子的角膜移植到人的角膜上。这样前后连做了盘永杰、莫绍成、丁家盛等三个病例，结果愈合得很好，角膜透明，三个盲人都不同程度的恢复了视力。
    “异体角膜移植”试验成功，它不但为角膜材料开辟了新的来源，以更多地满足患者的需要，而且这一创造性地把米丘林的学说运用到医学上来的成就，在医学研究上，具有很重大的意义。
