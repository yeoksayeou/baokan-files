Criticism and Suggestions Response

    Determined to Do a Good Job in Forest Fire Prevention
      (I)
    The People's Government of Hulin County, Heilongjiang Province, wrote: The criticism of our county's autumn forest fire prevention work by Comrade Me Lingquan of the Provincial Forestry Department and others, published in the People's Daily on November 28th last year, is completely correct. After the problems in our county's autumn forest fire prevention work were discovered by the provincial work group Comrade Me Lingquan and others, and suggestions for improvement were put forward, it aroused our attention. The next day, we convened a meeting of the county forest fire prevention headquarters committee, and decided to launch a forest fire prevention movement week. Subsequently, the county fire prevention headquarters issued a circular and instructions, and determined to conduct pilot projects in the first district to promote the overall effort; at the same time, work groups were sent to key areas to assist in carrying out forest fire prevention work.
    In the future, we will list forest fire prevention work as one of the central tasks, strengthen specific leadership, go deep into the lower levels, and educate the masses to do a good job in forest fire prevention work throughout the county.
        (II)
    The Hongxing State-Owned Machinery Farm wrote: Regarding the problem of our farm violating forest fire prevention regulations (burning wasteland and causing a fire to spread), in addition to ordering the personnel involved to make self-criticisms, and giving them respective penalties and notifications, the farm leaders also took the initiative to make a written self-criticism to the provincial and county forest fire prevention headquarters, requesting penalties and revocation of the honorary title of Second-Class Forest Protection Model Unit. Now the provincial forest fire prevention headquarters has agreed to revoke our farm's honorary title of Second-Class Forest Protection Model Unit, and will not impose additional administrative penalties.

专栏：批评建议的反应

    决心做好护林防火工作
      （一）
    黑龙江省虎林县人民政府来信：人民日报在去年十一月二十八日登载了省林业厅么凌权等同志对我县秋季护林防火工作的批评是完全正确的。我县秋季护林防火中存在的问题，经省工作组么凌权等同志发现提出了改进意见后，引起了我们的重视。第二天就召开了县护林防火指挥部委员会议，决定开展护林防火运动周。随后县防火指挥部发出了通报和指示，并确定在第一区搞点，以点推动全面；同时派出了工作组到重点地区协助开展护林防火工作。
    今后我们要将护林防火工作列为中心任务之一，加强具体领导，深入下层，教育群众把全县的护林防火工作搞好。
        （二）
    国营红星机械农场来信：关于我场违犯护林防火规章（烧荒跑火）的问题，我们除责成有关人员作出检讨，分别给予处分通报外，场领导并主动作出书面检讨报请省、县护林防火指挥部，要求给予处分和撤销二等护林模范单位的光荣称号。现在省护林防火指挥部已同意撤销我场二等护林模范单位的光荣称号，不另给予行政处分。
