The "Regulations on the Organization of Urban Sub-district Offices," the "Regulations on the Organization of Urban Residents' Committees," and the "Regulations on the Organization of Public Security Police Stations" have been promulgated and implemented. This will further improve the work of urban grassroots governments and is of great significance for strengthening urban public security work, closely linking the government and the people, thoroughly implementing policies and laws, and meeting the growing welfare needs of residents.

In the past few years, with the development of economic construction, the face of the city has undergone major changes: consumer cities have gradually become production cities, new industrial and mining cities have grown up, and the development of industry in cities has increasingly become a powerful driving force in my country's socialist construction. The urban population is also increasing sharply. The permanent resident population of cities across the country increased by more than 40 percent in 1953 compared with 1950. The development of urban construction and the increase in population have brought complexity to urban work. In order to obstruct our socialist construction, the enemy is also trying its best to destroy various construction undertakings and social order in our cities. Remnant and fugitive counter-revolutionaries, some unlawful capitalists who resolutely resist reform, and some hooligans and bandits who refuse to reform often collude with enemy agents in the cities to intensify their sabotage activities. Therefore, we must further strengthen urban public security work, more forcefully suppress all counter-revolutionary activities, and more effectively fight against various criminal activities, so as to ensure that the country's socialist construction can be carried out smoothly in a completely stable and orderly social environment.

However, in the past period, because the urban public security police stations concurrently handled some civil affairs work, they could not concentrate all their forces to maintain social order; and the public security police stations, due to their own duties, could not use much effort to systematically study and understand the policies, situations, and problems in civil affairs work, which also affected the development of civil affairs work.

The promulgation and implementation of the "Regulations on the Organization of Public Security Police Stations" will fundamentally improve this situation. After being relieved of the civil affairs work originally under their jurisdiction, public security police stations will not only be able to use all their strength to deal with special agents, hooligans, bandits, and other saboteurs, strengthen their crackdown and control, and effectively ensure social order and public security, guarantee the implementation of national laws and regulations, protect public property from theft and destruction, and protect citizens' rights from infringement; and it is also possible to conduct systematic social investigations, making urban public security work more proactive and planned. Public security police stations will also be able to strengthen leadership in mass activities such as preventing special agents, bandits, theft, and disasters, and play a greater role. At the same time, according to the provisions of the "Regulations on the Organization of Public Security Police Stations," the people will have a basis to supervise the work of the staff of the public security police stations, so that these grassroots public security cadres and their work will be placed under the supervision of the broad masses of the people. These are all necessary for the country to carry out large-scale economic construction, and these will create favorable conditions for socialist industrialization and socialist transformation.

As the country enters the period of socialist construction, the tasks of urban grassroots governments are becoming increasingly heavy. With the rapid development of various urban construction undertakings, new situations and new problems are constantly emerging in various aspects of social welfare, preferential treatment, public security, cultural, educational and health, mediation, and women's work for urban residents. Doing a good job in these areas will not only facilitate the daily life of the people, but also directly cooperate with and support socialist construction. This requires urban grassroots governments to further strengthen their ties with the people, and widely absorb the masses to participate in national management, so as to be able to understand the situation at any time, rely on the masses to properly solve problems, and better serve economic construction.

In the past, the organization of grassroots state administrative organs in general cities, especially large cities, was not sound enough. There were no subordinate organs of their own in the streets. Therefore, it was very inconvenient to implement policies and laws, to contact the people, and to accept the supervision of the people, which hindered the in-depth development of the work. Because the urban grassroots state administrative organs did not have their own subordinate organs in the streets, some civil affairs work had to be concurrently handled by the public security police stations, while in industrial and mining areas, some civil affairs work was handled by the industrial and mining administrative departments or trade union organizations. As a result, the pace and methods of work could not be unified, work efficiency was not high, and the industrial and mining administrative departments and trade union organizations undertook civil affairs, which dispersed the strength of leading production. This situation should of course be changed.

The sub-district office is a subordinate organ of the urban people's government. Its task is to handle matters assigned by the municipal people's government related to residents' work, guide the work of residents' committees, and reflect the opinions and demands of residents. The experience of many cities in establishing sub-district offices has proved that sub-district offices can greatly strengthen the work of grassroots state administrative organs, and it is a necessary organizational form during the period of large-scale national economic construction. The establishment of sub-district offices enables the municipal people's government to uniformly grasp the various matters originally handled by the public security police stations and industrial and mining administrative organs, so that it can systematically carry out work, and according to the needs of economic construction, distinguish the importance and urgency of various tasks, conduct unified deployment and research, and check the progress of work. With its own subordinate organs in the streets, the municipal people's government has strengthened the ties between the government and the people on a wider scale, and can listen to the opinions and demands of the masses at any time, making it easier to mobilize and organize the masses to implement policies and laws. The sub-district office undertakes a number of daily administrative affairs directly related to the people, such as handling marriage registration and issuing various certificates. This reduces the heavy administrative burden of the municipal people's government, and enables the municipal people's government to concentrate its efforts on doing more work in the cause of socialist industrialization and socialist transformation.

To strengthen the work of urban grassroots governments, it is necessary to rely on the active support of the broad masses of the people, and it is necessary to better organize urban residents so that the residents can play a greater role in these tasks. However, for a long time, there has been no unified and sound organization among the residents of urban streets. In some cities, within the jurisdiction of each public security police station, there are one or two security committee members and health committee members generated from the masses to lead the daily work of residents in this regard, and there are also many other mass organizations in the residents, which are respectively related to various departments and systems at the municipal level. Various departments and systems at the municipal level can directly assign tasks to these organizations and require residents to complete various "emergency tasks" for them. This creates a phenomenon of multi-headed command, organizational confusion, and busy work in the work of street residents. Not only is it difficult for the grassroots state administrative organs to lead these organizations and effectively carry out work, but also the activists in the streets often hinder their own production, life, and health, and hinder the improvement of their enthusiasm for participating in residents' work because of multiple concurrent jobs and many meetings.

Establishing residents' committees in cities is an effective measure to change this chaotic situation and improve the work of street residents. The establishment of residents' committees makes the original residents' mass organizations more substantial and unified. In cities where residents' committees have been established, many overlapping and complicated organizations among residents have been simplified, merged, or abolished. Most of the members of the residents' committees only hold one position, and each member can concentrate on doing their own work well. In this way, on the one hand, it is convenient for the sub-district office to lead the work of street residents, mobilize and organize the masses through the residents' committees, and complete various work tasks; on the other hand, the residents' committees also have the conditions to consider and run public welfare undertakings for residents. Because the scope of jurisdiction of the residents' committees is very small, it is easy to understand the situation and problems of each household, easy to understand the needs of residents, and in accordance with the principle of "everyone handles their own affairs," organize residents to jointly solve the problems of residents in all aspects of life, production, and study, and seek welfare for residents. In cities where residents' committees have been established, most of these problems are solved by residents with their own strength, and some are solved with the support of the government. The solution of these problems not only directly meets the needs of the residents, but also helps the socialist construction cause.

In order to enable urban grassroots governments to effectively serve economic construction, in the past two years, more than 70 cities across the country have piloted the establishment of sub-district offices and residents' committees, and strengthened the work of public security police stations. Facts have proved that the implementation of these measures has greatly facilitated the people in all aspects and promoted various socialist construction works. Therefore, the party and government leading organs of all cities must fully attach importance to these tasks, and in the future, actively start to establish organizations and carry out work in accordance with the provisions of the three organizational regulations that have been promulgated. Cities that have already established sub-district offices and residents' committees should, in accordance with the provisions of the organizational regulations, review the past work and further improve the future work.

### 改进城市基层政权工作的重要措施

    改进城市基层政权工作的重要措施
    城市街道办事处组织条例、城市居民委员会组织条例和公安派出所组织条例已经颁布实施了。这将进一步改进城市基层政权的工作，对于加强城市治安工作，密切政府和人民群众的联系，深入贯彻政策法令以及在满足居民日益增长的福利要求等方面，都有着十分重大的意义。
    几年来，随着经济建设的发展，城市的面貌发生了重大的变化：消费城市逐渐成为生产城市，新的工矿城市成长起来，城市里工业的发展在我国社会主义建设事业中日益形成强大的推动力。城市人口也在急骤地增加着。全国各城市常住人口，一九五三年比一九五○年增加了百分之四十以上。城市建设的发展和人口的增加，带来了城市工作的复杂性。敌人为了阻挠我们的社会主义建设，也极力要破坏我国城市各种建设事业和社会秩序。残余的和漏网的反革命分子，一些坚决抗拒改造的不法资本家，和一些拒绝改造的地痞流氓和盗匪，在城市里往往和敌人的特务相勾结，加紧其破坏活动。因此，我们必须更加加强城市治安工作，必须更加有力地镇压一切反革命活动，更加有效地向各种犯罪活动进行斗争，以确保国家社会主义建设能够在完全安定的有秩序的社会环境中顺利进行。
    但是，过去一个时期，由于城市公安派出所兼办一部分民政工作，不能很好地集中全部力量来维护社会治安；而公安派出所又因为本身职务关系，不可能用很大力量来系统地研究和了解民政工作方面的政策、情况和问题，也影响到民政工作的开展。
    公安派出所组织条例的颁布和实施，将要从根本上改善这一状况。公安派出所在解除原来兼管的民政工作之后，不仅能够把全部力量用来对付特务分子、流氓盗匪分子和其他破坏分子，加强对他们的打击和管制，有力地保障社会治安和公共秩序，保障国家法律和法令的贯彻实施，保障公共财产不被盗窃和破坏，保障公民权利不受侵害；并且也有可能进行系统的社会调查，使城市公安工作更加主动和更有计划。公安派出所对于群众性的防特、防匪、防盗、防灾等活动，也将有可能加强领导，发挥更大的作用。同时，按照公安派出所组织条例的规定，人民群众就有所依据来监督公安派出所的工作人员，使这些基层的公安干部和他们的工作，放在广大人民群众的监督下面。这些都是国家进行大规模经济建设所必需的，这些都将为社会主义工业化和社会主义改造事业创造有利条件。
    国家进入社会主义建设时期，城市基层政权的任务日加繁重。随着城市各项建设事业的迅速发展，城市居民的各种社会福利、优抚、治安保卫、文教卫生、调解、妇女等方面的工作，经常不断地出现新的情况和新的问题。这些方面的工作做好了，不仅便利人民的日常生活，而且能够直接配合和支援社会主义建设。这就要求城市基层政权进一步加强自己和人民群众的联系，广泛地吸收群众参加国家的管理工作，以便能够随时了解情况，依靠群众妥善地解决问题，更好地为经济建设服务。
    过去一般城市特别是大城市的基层国家行政机关组织不够健全，在街道中没有自己的派出机关，因而在贯彻政策法令，在联系人民群众，在接受人民群众的监督等方面，都十分不便，防碍着工作的深入开展。因为城市基层国家行政机关在街道中没有自己的派出机关，一部分民政工作不得不交由公安派出所兼管，而在工矿地区，一部分民政工作则由工矿行政部门或工会组织办理。这样做的结果，工作步调和方法就无法取得一致，工作效率不高，而且由于工矿行政部门和工会组织承担了民政事务，分散了领导生产的力量。这种情况当然是应该加以改变的。
    街道办事处是城市人民政府的派出机关，它的任务是办理市人民政府有关居民工作的交办事项，指导居民委员会的工作，反映居民的意见和要求。许多城市建立街道办事处的经验证明，街道办事处能够大大加强基层国家行政机关的工作，它是国家大规模经济建设时期的一种必要的组织形式。街道办事处的设立，使市人民政府把原来分散由公安派出所和工矿行政机关办理的各种事项统一掌握起来，从而能够有系统地进行工作，能够按照经济建设的需要，分别各种任务的轻重缓急，进行统一的布置、研究，并检查工作的进行情况。市人民政府在街道中有了自己的派出机构，就在更加广泛的范围内密切了政府和人民群众的联系，就能够随时听取群众的意见和要求，便于发动和组织群众贯彻政策和法律。街道办事处承担了若干直接关系于人民群众的日常行政事务，如办理婚姻登记、发给各种证明文件等工作。这就减轻了市人民政府繁重的事务性的负担，就使市人民政府能够集中力量在社会主义工业化和社会主义改造事业方面作更多的工作。
    加强城市基层政权工作，必须依靠广大群众的积极支持，必须把城市居民更好地组织起来，使居民群众在这些工作中发挥更大的作用。但城市街道居民中间，长时期以来都没有统一的健全的组织。有些城市，每一公安派出所辖区范围内，设有一二名群众中产生的治安委员和卫生委员，领导居民关于这方面的日常工作，而居民中的其他群众组织也很多，它们分别和市级各部门各系统有着联系。市级各部门各系统可以向这些组织直接布置工作，要求居民为它们完成各项“紧急任务”。这样就造成街道居民工作中的多头指挥、组织混乱和工作忙迫的现象。基层国家行政机关不仅很难对这些组织实行领导，有效地开展工作，而且街道中的积极分子，也往往因为兼职多、会议多，而妨害自己的生产、生活和健康，妨害他们参加居民工作的积极性的提高。
    在城市中建立居民委员会，是改变这种混乱状况和改进街道居民工作的有效措施。居民委员会的建立，使原来的居民群众组织充实而统一起来。在已经建立居民委员会的城市，居民中许多重叠繁杂的组织，经过简化、合并或撤消，所有居民委员会委员，大多数只任一职，每一个委员就可能集中力量作好自己的工作。这样，一方面既便于街道办事处领导街道居民的工作，通过居民委员会来发动群众和组织群众，完成各项工作任务；另一方面使居民委员会也有条件来考虑和举办居民的公共福利事业。居民委员会因为所辖范围很小，就容易了解各户的情况和问题，容易了解居民的需求，并按照
  “大家的事情大家办”的原则，组织居民共同解决居民在生活、生产和学习的各方面问题，为居民谋福利。在建立居民委员会的城市，这些工作多半都由居民用自己的力量加以解决，有的则在政府支持下得到解决。这些问题的解决，不仅直接满足了居民的需要，同时也有助于社会主义建设事业的进行。
    为了使城市基层政权有效地为经济建设服务，近两年来，全国有七十个以上的城市试行建立了街道办事处和居民委员会的组织，加强了公安派出所的工作。事实证明，实行这些措施在各方面都大大便利了人民群众，促进了社会主义的各项建设工作。因此，各城市党政领导机关都必须充分重视这些工作，并在今后按照已经颁布的三个组织条例的规定积极着手建立组织，开展工作。已经建立街道办事处和居民委员会的城市，更应该按照组织条例的规定，检查过去的工作，进一步改进今后的工作。
