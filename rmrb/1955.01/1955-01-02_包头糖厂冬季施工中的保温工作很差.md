To the Editor:

    The civil engineering work of the state-owned Baotou Sugar Factory has been completed, and the machine installation project is currently underway. Due to the sugar factory leadership's failure to adequately prepare for winter construction in advance, the cold protection and insulation work has not been properly resolved to date, which has seriously affected the progress of the project and the health of the workers.

    The workers responsible for machine installation at the Baotou Sugar Factory are from the Electrical Engineering Team of the Design and Engineering Company of the Light Industry Bureau in Guangdong. Most of these workers have never spent a winter in the north, let alone have experience in winter construction. The Light Industry Bureau has repeatedly instructed the sugar factory to fully prepare for winter construction to ensure production convenience and worker health; however, these instructions have not been given due attention. Last October, the temperature in Baotou had dropped below zero, and the installation workers were still living in temporary sheds. Some could not sleep at night due to the cold, and some began to develop frostbite on their hands and feet. It was not until the weather station issued a notice that the temperature might drop to minus twenty degrees Celsius that the site leadership issued an emergency instruction to move the installation workers into the newly built buildings. At that time, the heating, water, and electricity equipment in the new living area were not yet ready. In the half month after the workers moved into the new dormitory on November 10th, heating was only provided twice, each time for a short period and at an insufficient temperature, and the heating problem remained unresolved.

    The cold protection and insulation of the construction workshop are also poor. Some heating pipes have leaked water and air. In addition, the design is inadequate, with too few boilers and too many pipes, covering too wide an area, so that many heating radiators are ice-cold. For example, the heating pipes near the seven-meter-deep sedimentation tank have frozen and cracked in many places, with condensate constantly flowing out; even thick ice has formed on the heating radiators next to the washing machine in the work area. At the same time, the doors with frequent traffic in each workshop are not equipped with windshields, and the cold air from outside constantly flows in, further affecting the indoor temperature. According to regulations, the workshop temperature should be 16 degrees Celsius during the day and no lower than 6 degrees Celsius at night during winter construction; however, the workshop temperature is often at minus three or four degrees Celsius.

    This situation has seriously affected the progress of construction and the quality of the project. Construction machinery is often frozen, and a lot of time is spent baking it every morning, wasting a lot of work hours. After the cement foundation of the hot water tank on the upper floor was poured, cracks appeared, and the water inside had frozen into ice; the steel frame of the power switchboard in the main factory's underground was installed on the wall, and the next day it was found that the gray iron had frozen. It melted when heated with fire, resulting in a complete rework.

    In late November, the problem became serious, and the sugar factory leadership took remedial measures, adding some temporary coal stoves and coke stoves in the workshop. However, the number of stoves was very small, and the smoke was not circulated for warming, so the workshop was filled with smoke. Currently, the outdoor temperature is often between minus ten and twenty degrees Celsius, so the indoor temperature has not risen significantly. Many machines that have been installed cannot be tested for water pressure and test runs smoothly. Some workers' hands are swollen with frostbite. On December 8th, worker Wu Qing fainted from the cold next to the washing machine.

    The Baotou Sugar Factory should quickly take effective measures to strengthen cold protection and insulation to ensure the smooth progress of winter construction.

### 包头糖厂冬季施工中的保温工作很差

    包头糖厂冬季施工中的保温工作很差编辑同志：
    国营包头糖厂土建工程已经结束，目前正在进行机器安装工程。由于糖厂领导方面对冬季施工事先没有做好准备工作，到目前为止防寒保暖工作还没有妥善解决，以致严重地影响了工程进度和工人健康。
    在包头糖厂担任机器安装工作的是来自广东的轻工业局设计工程公司所属电机队的工人。这些工人，大部分没有在北方过过冬，更没有冬季施工的经验。轻工业局一再指示糖厂要充分做好冬季施工的准备，保证生产方便和工人健康；但是，这些指示并没有得到应有的重视。去年十月份，包头气温已降到零度以下，安装工人还住在临时工棚里，有的人在夜里冻得睡不着觉，有的人手脚开始生冻疮。直到气象台发出最近气温可能降至零下二十度的通告后，现场领导方面才下紧急指示，让安装工人搬进新盖的楼房。当时，新建生活区的采暖、水电等设备都还没有准备好。十一月十日工人搬进新宿舍以后的半个月中，仅仅生过两次暖气，每次时间不长，温度也不够，采暖问题仍然没有得到解决。
    施工厂房的防寒保温情况也不好，有的暖气管已经漏水、漏气，加上设计不周，锅炉太少，管道太多，供给范围过广，以致很多暖气片是冷冰冰的。如七公尺深的沉淀池附近的暖气管冻裂多处，冷凝水不断外流；工区洗涤机旁的暖气片上面竟然也结上了厚冰。同时，各车间经常有人出入的大门没有加设挡风门，室外寒气不断窜入，更影响了室内的温度。按规定冬季施工时厂房温度白天应为摄氏十六度，晚上不得低于六度；但厂房温度常常在零下三、四度。
    这种情况严重地影响了施工进度和工程质量。施工机械经常被冻住，每天早晨要花很多时间来烘烤，浪费了不少工时。楼上热水桶的水泥基础灌好后出现裂缝，里面水分已结成冰块；主厂房地下动力开关牌箱的钢架安好在墙上，第二天发现灰口结冰，用火一烘就溶化了，结果全部返工。
    十一月下旬，问题严重了，糖厂领导方面才采取补救办法，在工场里添置一些临时煤炉和焦炭炉。但是，炉子数量很少，而且没有采用烟囱盘旋保暖，厂房内烟雾弥漫。目前室外温度经常在零下十度到二十度，因此室内温度没有显著上升。很多已经安好的机器，不能顺利地试水压和试运转。有的工人双手冻得肿起来了。十二月八日，发生了工人吴清在洗涤机旁冻得昏倒的事件。
    包头糖厂应该迅速采取有效措施来加强防寒保暖工作，以保证冬季施工顺利进行。
