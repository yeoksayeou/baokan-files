(Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 29th) According to the Vietnam News Agency, Hanoi, January 29th: The political conference between the political delegation of the Royal Lao Government and the political delegation of the Lao Fighting Forces, which began on January 18th, has held three meetings.

    At the first meeting on January 18th, the political delegation of the Lao Fighting Forces issued a statement. The statement pointed out the necessity of establishing close cooperation between the Lao Fighting Forces and the Royal Lao Government in order to resolve the outstanding issues in the implementation of the Geneva Armistice Agreement, thereby helping to consolidate peace and realize Laos's democracy, unity, and independence. At the meeting held on January 19th, the political delegation of the Royal Lao Government elaborated on its approval of the content of the aforementioned statement by the Lao delegation.

    Due to the efforts of both sides, the political conference issued a joint statement, indicating that both sides are willing to "simultaneously implement the Geneva Armistice Agreement in order to jointly consolidate peace, bring freedom and democracy to the people, realize unity, and achieve national independence." In this joint statement, both sides "believe that they will seek all possible ways to resolve all issues related to national independence through consultation, with a view to achieving satisfactory results."

    On January 20th, both sides began to discuss the issue of ending all military actions between the Royal Lao Forces and the Lao Fighting Forces, as well as the establishment of a Lao Political Consultative Committee. In the process of discussing the above two issues, the views of the two delegations were not entirely consistent on some points. Although the Lao side demonstrated sincerity and a conciliatory attitude, modifying its proposals to bring the views of both sides closer, the discussion of these issues still did not make much progress.

    It is reported that the political delegation of the Royal Lao Government has recently returned to Vientiane for a week to obtain further instructions from the Royal Government.

    老挝政治会议发表联合声明
    双方愿意通过协商解决国家独立的问题
    【新华社二十九日讯】据越南通讯社河内二十九日讯：老挝王国政府政治代表团和寮国战斗部队政治代表团之间举行的政治会议，在一月十八日开始后已经开了三次会。
    在十八日的第一次会议上，寮国战斗部队政治代表团发表了一个声明。声明指出有必要在寮国战斗部队和老挝王国政府之间建立密切的合作，以便解决在执行日内瓦停战协定方面仍然悬而未决的各项问题，从而有助于巩固和平，实现老挝的民主、统一和独立。在一月十九日举行的会议上，老挝王国政府政治代表团详细说明了它赞成上述的寮国代表团声明的内容。
    由于双方的努力，政治会议发表了一个联合声明，表明双方都愿意“同时实行日内瓦停战协定，以便共同来巩固和平，给人民带来自由和民主，实现统一和达到国家独立”。在这个联合声明里，双方“认为他们将寻求一切可能的办法，通过协商解决一切有关国家独立的问题，以期取得圆满的结果”。
    一月二十日，双方开始讨论在老挝王国部队和寮国战斗部队之间结束一切军事行动的问题，以及建立老挝政治协商委员会的问题。在讨论上述两项问题的过程中，双方代表团的看法在某些点上是不太一致的。虽然寮国方面表现了诚意和和解的态度，把它的建议加以修改，以使双方的看法能够接近，但是对这些问题的讨论仍然没有取得很大的进展。
    据悉，老挝王国政府政治代表团已在最近返回万象一个星期，向王国政府取得进一步的指示。
