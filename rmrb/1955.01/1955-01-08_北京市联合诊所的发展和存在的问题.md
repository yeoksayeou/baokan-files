    The development of joint clinics in Beijing has been promoted by the Ministry of Health and supported by the Beijing Public Health Bureau. From 1951 to the present, a total of forty-three joint clinics and twenty-eight branch clinics have been organized. Most of these joint clinics are organized around experienced traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioners, uniting other private TCM and Western medicine practitioners. According to the Ministry of Health's organizational methods for joint medical institutions, these joint clinics are located in areas with weak medical resources, such as the outer city districts, industrial and mining areas, and suburban rural areas, becoming strong assistants to Beijing's public medical institutions. According to statistics from some joint clinics, from January of the year before last to September of last year, they treated a total of 698,900 outpatients, equivalent to the total number of outpatients at an average municipal hospital for thirty months; they administered various preventive vaccinations to a total of 109,400 people, equivalent to six or seven months' workload for a district health center.
    The doctors in the joint clinics have a certain level of medical skill and clinical experience. After further study, they have increased their scientific knowledge. They actively respond to the government's call to conduct regular scientific health knowledge promotion in industrial and mining areas and residential areas, and cooperate with national medical and health institutions in carrying out medical prevention work and other seasonal health and epidemic prevention work. In carrying out these tasks, they have also demonstrated a serious and responsible medical attitude and a realistic medical style, thus establishing a high reputation among workers, peasants, and the masses. For example, the Yongdingmen Joint Clinic is a joint TCM and Western medicine clinic composed of experienced TCM practitioners and other private TCM and Western medicine practitioners. Their medication principle is mainly based on TCM, but in the treatment process, in addition to using the original diagnostic and treatment methods of TCM, they also apply scientific medical diagnosis and examination. For more serious and complex diseases, doctors of TCM and Western medicine within the clinic often hold consultations to jointly determine treatment principles and treatment plans. When encountering diseases that they cannot treat or diagnose clearly for the time being, they actively contact municipal hospitals and transfer patients for treatment. In short, they strive to ensure accurate diagnosis and effective treatment for every patient. TCM joint clinics without the participation of Western medicine doctors generally also attach great importance to the application of scientific medical diagnosis and examination. In order to facilitate public medical treatment, most joint clinics also implement specialized treatment according to the specialties of each doctor, generally with internal medicine, general surgery, acupuncture, orthopedics, obstetrics and gynecology departments; joint clinics near rural areas also provide mobile medical services based on the special circumstances of rural areas. They have changed the old style and habits of "pretending to know what they don't know" and "doctors not knocking on doors."
    Because the joint clinics have established a reputation among the masses, many factories, enterprises, and agricultural production cooperatives are willing to establish medical entrustment relationships or sign medical contracts with the joint clinics. For example, the Mentougou Joint Clinic has now established medical entrustment relationships with thirty-one nearby industrial and mining enterprises, and seventeen joint clinics such as Fengtai, Nanyuan, Yongdingmen, and Yuegezhuang have successively signed medical contracts with seventy-one agricultural production cooperatives such as "Xinghuo" and "Wuyi," initially solving the medical problems of workers, peasants, and the masses in these areas.
    The development of Beijing's joint clinic system is inseparable from the help of the Ministry of Health, the Beijing Public Health Bureau, and Beijing TCM academic organizations. In the early stage of establishing joint clinics, the Ministry of Health selected several joint clinics such as Yongdingmen and Haidian as key pilot projects. Experience was accumulated from the pilot projects, the organizational principles of joint clinics were initially determined, and the direction of development of joint clinics was determined, creating conditions and providing experience for the organization of joint clinics by a large number of private TCM and Western medicine practitioners in Beijing. The Beijing Public Health Bureau also assigned full-time cadres to be responsible for organizing and guiding the work of the joint clinics, and provided possible support and assistance in terms of funding, medical technology, and business development. For example, for joint clinics with insufficient funds, banks were introduced to provide loans based on business development; when the joint clinics encountered difficulties in drug supply, drug supply issues were studied with the pharmaceutical departments, and research was conducted with the tax departments to jointly decide to exempt the joint clinics from business tax. In addition, the health organizations in the districts were instructed to provide certain guidance and assistance to the joint clinics in terms of technology, as well as political and business learning. The Beijing TCM Association and the Beijing TCM Training School also cared about the joint clinics, such as holding regular academic report meetings for them and helping them solve difficult diagnostic problems. Due to the active assistance from all parties, the organization of joint clinics not only leveraged the potential power of TCM and met the medical needs of the workers, peasants, and masses to a greater extent, which was welcomed by the masses, but also strengthened the unity between TCM and Western medicine to a certain extent, enriched the medical knowledge of TCM and Western medicine, and improved the level of medical technology.
    Although this organizational form of joint clinics is advocated by the government, its nature and tasks are not fully understood by the members of the joint clinics, relevant agencies, and the general public. Some believe that the joint clinics are public-private cooperative institutions; some believe that they are jointly-operated private enterprises; some believe that they are a bridge from individual operation to collective operation to state operation; and some believe that they are jointly-operated social welfare undertakings. In addition, the motivations of some doctors participating in the joint clinics are different; and the health departments have not been able to provide them with regular political and ideological education. Therefore, in the process of business development, many joint clinics have also experienced some problems and disputes, which once affected the development of the joint clinic's business.
    The biggest impact, which once caused disunity within the clinic, was the so-called "labor-capital relationship" issue caused by a misunderstanding of the nature of the joint clinic. In 1952, some people regarded the doctors who raised funds to form joint clinics as capitalists. For example, the pharmacists of the Haidian Joint Clinic once described the doctors in charge of leading the clinic as agents of the capitalists and wanted to carry out struggles against them. Later, after joint research by the health department and the trade union, it was determined that the joint clinic was a social welfare undertaking jointly organized by independent mental workers, not industry and commerce. For the convenience of work, the clinic can hire some assistants. As long as the doctor himself is the main laborer, there is no "labor-capital relationship." Even if there is a slight distribution of profits, it is only a matter of gradual transformation and cannot change the nature of the joint clinic. As for those who absorb drug dealers and capitalists to participate, or those who aim to sell drugs, are not included in this category. However, because the Beijing Health Department did not organize in-depth discussions among the members of the joint clinics to make each member clearly understand the cooperative relationship between each other, although there were some correct regulations, the gap between doctors and employees was not completely eliminated. Therefore, not long ago, the Beijing Public Health Bureau had to solve a similar dispute that occurred in the Guang'anmen Joint Clinic.
    Regarding the issue of wages, in the early stage of the establishment of the joint clinics, because the business had not yet developed significantly and the income was not much, the doctors were concerned about how to develop the business. Everyone had no opinion on the distribution of consultation fees and wages. The wealthier doctors with some savings only took out a little travel expenses at most, and those with particularly difficult lives only received a little living expenses. However, with the development of the business and the increase in income, in order to consolidate and develop the clinic, it is necessary to have a certain system to rationally handle the income from consultation fees. The various clinics have also determined some systems. Generally, there is no objection to the agreed ratios in terms of the distribution of public accumulation funds, the distribution of welfare funds, the replenishment of medicines, and the payment of the necessary recurring expenses for maintaining the clinic. However, there is a tendency of egalitarianism in individual wages. For example, the doctors of the Haidian, Mentougou, and other joint clinics, in order to avoid hurting each other's harmony, gave equal or almost equal wages regardless of technical level. On the surface, everyone had no objection, but in reality, they had opinions but did not say so. As a result, some doctors worked passively, and some went home to practice privately, which seriously affected the development of the joint clinic's business. Because the health department overemphasized that this was a private matter within the clinic, and simply carried out mediation from the perspective of personal feelings, it did not actively educate them on the principle of "to each according to his work" and democratically assessing wages based on technical level, nor did it promptly summarize and promote the preliminary experience of using technical level to assess wage base adopted by the Guogongzhuang Joint Clinic. Therefore, until now, the tendency of egalitarianism in the wage issue of the various joint clinics still exists, hindering the exertion of the doctors' enthusiasm.
    The TCM doctors of the joint clinics hold a welcoming attitude towards scientific medical knowledge. They not only pay attention to the application of scientific medical knowledge and methods in diagnosis, and use their spare time to learn scientific medical knowledge, but also universally and spontaneously require cooperation with Western medicine doctors. However, due to the unclear purpose of learning, and the health department did not actively provide necessary guidance and assistance in various aspects, some TCM doctors gradually abandoned the original treatment methods of TCM after contacting scientific medical knowledge, and used a large number of Western medicines that they were not yet familiar with. This bias only changed after the government called for the development of the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine. Most doctors in joint clinics now use TCM as much as possible for treatments, based on their own diagnoses, except for a few well-known and necessary special Western medicines, and try to take care of the patient's convenience in taking medication. The current problem is that the health department needs to provide planned guidance and assistance in how to study and develop the experience of traditional Chinese medicine from clinical work.
    Last year, in order to strengthen leadership over the joint clinics, the Beijing Public Health Bureau transferred the specific leadership work of the joint clinics to the health departments of each district. However, the health departments of some districts did not pay enough attention to this work. Therefore, there are still some chaotic phenomena in the joint clinics in these districts. For example, the Qinghezhen and Qinghuayuan Joint Clinics were not in bad business conditions in the early stage of their establishment. However, since the second half of last year, their business has been far worse than before. This is due to the poor technical skills of the clinic members, their poor work attitude, unsound internal organization, and internal disunity, etc. On the other hand, it is because the health departments of the districts did not provide regular assistance in terms of politics, ideology, and business.
    The development of Beijing's joint clinic system is relatively normal. At present, the responsibility of the Beijing Health Department lies in continuously helping them overcome the shortcomings revealed in the development process, summarizing the experience of organizing joint clinics, and continuing to support them to move forward steadily. Therefore, the Beijing Health Department, especially the district health agencies responsible for grassroots leadership work, should strengthen the political and ideological education of the members of the joint clinics in a planned manner, help them improve their organization, establish and strengthen the internal business system and learning system of the clinics, promote democracy, so as to improve their work enthusiasm, help them improve their medical skills, so that they can cooperate with each other under the leadership of the health department, sort out and summarize the effective experiences in traditional Chinese medicine from the development of TCM business, and further learn scientific medical knowledge, strengthen the cooperation between TCM and Western medicine, and improve their professional level.

    北京市联合诊所的发展和存在的问题
    章原
    北京市的联合诊所事业是在卫生部的倡导，和北京市公共卫生局的扶植下发展起来的。从一九五一年到现在，共组织了四十三个联合诊所，二十八个分诊所。这些联合诊所绝大部分是以进修过的中医为骨干，团结其它开业中西医组织起来的。根据卫生部关于联合医疗机构组织办法，这些联合诊所分设在市辖的关厢区、工矿区和近郊农村等医疗力量薄弱的地区，成为北京市公立医疗机构的有力的助手。根据部分联合诊所的统计，从前年一月到去年九月，共看门诊病人达到六十九万八千九百多人次，相当于一个普通市立医院三十个月的门诊总数；进行了各种预防注射共十万九千四百多人次，相当于一个区卫生所六、七个月的工作量。
    联合诊所的医生们都有一定的医疗技术水平和临床经验，经过进修，都增加了科学知识，他们积极响应政府号召，在工矿区、居民区进行经常性的科学卫生知识的宣传，配合国家医疗卫生机构进行医疗预防工作及其它季节性的卫生防疫工作。在进行这些工作中，他们也表现了认真负责的医疗态度和实事求是的医疗作风，因而在工农群众中树立了很高的威信。比如永定门联合诊所，这是一个以进修过的中医为骨干，联合其它开业中西医组成的中西医联合诊所。他们的用药原则，主要是以中药为主，但在治疗过程中，除了应用中医原有的诊断和治疗方法外，还应用科学医学的诊断和检查。比较严重的、复杂的病症，经常由所内的中西医会诊，共同确定治疗原则和治疗方针。遇到为自己所无法治疗或一时诊断不清的病症，便主动和市立医院联系，转院治疗。总之，对每一个病人都力求作到诊断正确和治疗有效。没有西医参加的中医联合诊所，一般也非常重视应用科学医学的诊断和检查。为了便利群众就诊，大部分联合诊所还按照各个医师的特长实行了分科治疗，一般设有内科、普通外科、针灸科、正骨科、妇产科等；临近农村的联合诊所还根据农村的特殊情况，巡回医疗。他们改变了“强不知以为知”、“医不叩门”的旧作风、旧习气。
    由于联合诊所在群众中树立了威信，不少工厂企业单位、农业生产合作社都愿意同联合诊所建立医疗嘱托关系，或者订立医疗合同。如门头沟联合诊所现在和临近的三十一个工矿企业单位建立了医疗嘱托关系，丰台、南苑、永定门、岳各庄等十七个联合诊所，先后和“星火”、“五一”等七十一个农业生产合作社订立了医疗合同，初步解决了这些地区的工农群众的医疗问题。
    北京市联合诊所事业的发展，是同卫生部、北京市公共卫生局以及北京中医学术团体的帮助分不开的。在建立联合诊所的初期，卫生部曾选择了永定门、海甸等几个联合诊所作为典型试办的重点。从试办中积累了经验，初步确定了联合诊所的组织原则，确定了联合诊所的发展方向，为北京市广大开业中西医师组织联合诊所创造了条件和提供了经验。北京市公共卫生局也配备了专职干部负责组织和指导联合诊所的工作，并在资金、医疗技术和业务发展方面都给予了可能的支持和帮助。如对资金不足的联合诊所，便根据业务发展情况，介绍银行给予贷款；联合诊所的药物供应发生了困难，便和医药部门研究药物供应问题，并且和税务部门研究，共同决定免除了联合诊所的营业税。此外，还指示区的卫生组织必须在技术上以及政治和业务学习上给予联合诊所以一定的指导和帮助。北京市中医学会和北京中医进修学校也非常关心联合诊所，如为他们举办定期的学术报告会，帮助他们解决诊断上的疑难问题等。由于各方面的积极帮助，联合诊所的组织不仅发挥了中医的潜在力量，更多地满足了工农群众的医疗要求，受到群众的欢迎，而且，在一定程度上加强了中西医之间的团结，丰富了中西医的医学知识，提高了医疗技术水平。
    联合诊所这种组织形式虽然为政府所提倡，但其性质和任务并不完全为联合诊所的组成人员和有关机关以及一般群众所了解。有的认为联合诊所是民办公助的合作社性质的机构；有的认为是合股经营的私人企业；有的认为是从个体经营经过集体经营转为国家经营的桥梁；有的认为是联营的社会福利事业。再加上一些医师参加联合诊所的动机各有不同；而卫生部门又没有能对他们进行经常性的政治思想教育，因此，在业务发展的过程中，不少联合诊所内部也曾发生过一些问题和纠纷，一度影响到联合诊所业务的开展。
    影响最大的，曾使诊所内部闹不团结的，就是由于不了解联合诊所的性质而引起的所谓“劳资关系”问题。在一九五二年，曾经有人把筹资组成联合诊所的医师看成是资本家，如海甸联合诊所的司药员等，就曾经把负责领导诊所的医师说成是资方代理人，要进行斗争。后来，经过卫生部门和工会共同研究，确定联合诊所是独立脑力劳动者联合组织的社会福利事业，不是工商业。为了工作的方便，诊所可以雇用一些助手，只要医师本人是主要劳动者，便没有“劳资关系”，即使有稍许的资金分红，也只不过是逐渐改造的问题，不能因此而改变了联合诊所的性质。至于吸收药商和资本家参加，或以售卖药品为目的的，不在此列。但是，由于北京市卫生部门没有在联合诊所的成员中组织深入的讨论，使诊所的每一个成员明确认识相互间的合作关系；因此，虽然有了一些正确的规定，但医师和被雇人员之间的隔膜仍未完全消除。因而在不久以前，北京市公共卫生局又不得不去解决广安门联合诊所发生的类似纠纷。
    关于工资问题，在联合诊所建立的初期，由于业务还没有得到大的发展，收入不多，当时医师们所关心的是：怎样发展业务，在诊金收入的分配和工资问题上大家都没有什么意见。比较富裕和稍有积蓄的医师至多只是支取一点交通费，生活特别困难的也只领取一点维持生活的费用。但是，随着业务的发展，收入的增多，要巩固和发展诊所，便须要有一定的制度，合理地处理诊金收入。各诊所也确定了一些制度，在公积金的分配、福利金的分配、补充药品和支付维持诊所所必需的经常费用等方面所商定的比数，一般都没有什么意见，只是在个人工资上存在着平均主义的偏向。如海甸、门头沟等联合诊所的医师，为了怕伤害彼此之间的和气，不论技术高低都给予相等或几乎相等的工资，表面上大家没有意见，实际上有意见不说。结果有的医师工作消极，有的回家私自开业，严重地影响了联合诊所业务的开展。由于卫生部门过分地强调了这是诊所内部的私人间的事情，单纯地从私人感情方面去进行调解，没有积极地向他们进行按劳取酬、按技术优劣民主评定工资的教育，也没有及时总结郭公庄联合诊所所采用的按技术优劣评定工资基数的初步经验，加以推广；因此，到现在为止，各联合诊所在工资问题方面的平均主义倾向依然存在，妨碍了发挥医师们的积极性。
    联合诊所的中医，对科学医学知识抱着欢迎的态度，他们不仅在诊断上注意应用科学医学知识和方法，利用业余时间学习科学医学知识，而且普遍自发地要求和西医合作。但是，由于学习的目的不明确，卫生部门又没有积极地从各个方面给予必要的指导和帮助，部分中医在接触了科学医学知识以后，逐渐放弃了中医原有的治疗方法，大量使用自己还不太熟悉的西药。这一偏向，在政府号召发扬祖国医学遗产以后，才有所转变，大部分联合诊所的医师都根据自己的诊断，除去几种为人们所熟知的、必要的特效西药外，凡能用中药治好的，都用中药，并尽可能照顾病人的服用便利。目前的问题是，如何从临床工作中研究和发扬祖国医学的经验还需要卫生部门有计划地给予指导和帮助。
    去年，北京市公共卫生局为了加强对联合诊所的领导，已将联合诊所的具体领导工作交给各区的卫生部门负责。但是，有些区的卫生部门对这一工作重视不够，因而这些区里的联合诊所还存在一些混乱现象。如清河镇、清华园等联合诊所，在创办初期，业务情况不算太坏，但是，从去年下半年以来业务远不如以前，这一方面由于诊所组成人员的技术差，工作态度不好，内部组织不健全，以及内部不团结等，另一方面则因区的卫生部门没有从政治上、思想上、业务上经常给予帮助。
    北京市联合诊所事业的发展是比较正常的。目前北京市卫生部门的责任在于不断地帮助它们克服在发展过程中暴露出来的缺点，总结组织联合诊所的经验，继续扶植它们稳步前进。因之，北京市的卫生部门，特别是负责基层领导工作的区的卫生机关，应有步骤地加强对联合诊所成员的政治思想教育，帮助他们健全组织，建立和加强诊所内部的业务制度和学习制度，发扬民主，以提高他们的工作积极性，帮助他们提高医疗技术水平，使他们能在卫生部门的领导下，互助合作，从发展中医业务中，整理和总结祖国医学中的有效经验，并进一步学习科学医学的知识，加强中西医的合作，提高业务水平。
