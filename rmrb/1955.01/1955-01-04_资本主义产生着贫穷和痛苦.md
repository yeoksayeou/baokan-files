Capitalism Generates Poverty and Suffering
Millions of Unemployed Americans Roam Everywhere

I. Novikov recently published an article in "Pravda" commenting on the tragic fate of unemployed Americans.

The article wrote: According to union estimates, the number of unemployed in the United States is over five million. In fact, there are many cities in the United States where the vast majority of citizens have no work. For example, a year ago, steel factories in Canton, northeastern Ohio, employed tens of thousands of workers. Now most have lost their jobs, and those still working only work two or three days a week.

The article pointed out that American officials have also had to admit that many Americans have lost the right to receive meager unemployment benefits. Labor Secretary Mitchell said on December 3, 1954, that in the first nine months of 1954, more than 1.3 million workers lost their right to receive unemployment benefits, even though they still had no work.

Recently, American newspapers have increasingly used the term "phantom city." A year ago, these cities were still lively, and their citizens had jobs, but now these cities have become "phantoms," reflecting the tragic situation of economic recession and depression.

These "phantom cities" can be found in many parts of the United States, and their number is constantly increasing. Unemployed people, unable to make a living in their own cities, pack their meager belongings and begin to wander the country, hoping to find a job. But their hopes are dashed. According to the Labor Department figures published in the "New York Times" on October 17, 1954, no region in the United States needs labor anymore. The "New York Post" recently reported a very telling incident in this big city. The New York City Council Housing Bureau announced that it needed twenty doormen. As a result, eight hundred people immediately applied.

The article finally pointed out that the American ruling group has so far been completely indifferent to the fate of millions of unemployed people.

Many Progressive Groups Blacklisted

U.S. Attorney General Brownell has added twenty-seven more organizations to the list of "subversive" organizations, including five peace organizations. Currently, two hundred and fifty-four organizations have been listed as so-called "subversive" organizations.

These groups include the National Council of Scientific, Art, and Professional Workers, the National Committee to Petition for Amnesty for Smith Act Victims, and many local groups that are fighting for peace, defending civil rights, and opposing unemployment.

    资本主义产生着贫穷和痛苦
    美国数百万失业者到处流浪
    伊·诺维科夫最近在“真理报”上发表文章，评述美国失业者的悲惨命运。
    文章写道：据工会估计，美国的失业人数在五百万人以上。事实上，美国有不少城市，绝大多数公民没有工作做。例如，一年前，俄亥俄州东北部坎顿城的钢铁工厂雇佣了数以万计的工人。现在大多数人已经失业，还在做工的人每周只工作两三天。
    文章指出，美国的官员也不得不承认，许多美国人已经丧失领取少得可怜的失业救济金的权利。劳工部长密契尔一九五四年十二月三日说，在一九五四年头九个月中，有一百三十万以上的工人丧失了领取失业救济金的权利，尽管他们仍旧没有工作做。
    最近美国报纸越来越频繁地用到“幻影城市”这个字眼。一年以前，这些城市还很热闹，它们的公民有工作可做，而现在这些城市却变成了“幻影”，反映了经济衰退和萧条的悲惨情况。
    这种“幻影城市”在美国许多地方可以找到，而且数目不断在增加。失业者由于在本城无法谋生，就收拾起单薄的行装开始在全国流浪，希望找到职业。但是他们的希望成了泡影。根据一九五四年十月十七日“纽约时报”发表的劳工部数字，美国没有一个地区再需要劳动力。“纽约邮报”最近报道了这个大城市中发生的一件很能说明问题的事情。纽约市政委员会房屋局宣布说，它需要二十名守门人。结果立刻有八百人应征。
    文章最后指出，美国统治集团到目前为止对几百万失业者的命运一直毫不关心。
  许多进步团体被列入黑名单
    美国司法部部长布朗纳尔在“颠覆性”组织的名单上又增加了二十七个团体，其中包括五个争取和平的团体。目前被列入所谓“颠覆性”组织名单的已经有二百五十四个团体。
    这些团体中有科学、艺术及自由职业全国委员会，要求赦免史密斯法受害者全国委员会，以及许多争取和平、保卫公民权利和反对失业的地方团体。　（据新华社讯）
