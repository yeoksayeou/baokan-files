Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, January 10th: The scale of construction in the steel city of Anshan this year is more grand and complex than in previous years. The people building Anshan will complete a construction and installation workload approximately double that of 1954, the majority of which belongs to Anshan Iron and Steel Company.

The projects to be built by Anshan Iron and Steel Company this year include more than 100 items covering mining, ore dressing, iron smelting, steelmaking, and steel rolling. In the mountains near Anshan, several large-scale construction projects for mines and ore dressing plants will be carried out this year. Two blast furnaces in the iron smelting plant will be rebuilt into automated blast furnaces this year. The renovation of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant will continue this year, and when the entire project is completed, the plant's output will increase by about 20% compared to last year. The Anshan No. 2 Ore Dressing Plant and No. 2 Sintering Plant, which have been out of production for nearly ten years, will also be given new life this year. This year there will also be more projects that involve simultaneous production and renovation, and particularly complex construction management, than in previous years.

In order to ensure the timely completion of these projects, the builders of Angang will comprehensively and systematically study the Soviet Union this year, launch a labor emulation campaign to comprehensively complete the national plan, and will also improve labor organization, adopt advanced construction methods, reduce downtime and wasted work, and expand the scope of piece-rate wages and other major measures.

    鞍山今年建筑安装工程量比去年增加一倍
    【新华社鞍山十日电】　钢都鞍山今年的建设规模，比往年更加宏伟和复杂。建设鞍山的人们今年将要完成约等于一九五四年的两倍的建筑安装工程量，其中绝大部分属于鞍山钢铁公司。
    鞍山钢铁公司今年要建设的工程，包括采矿、选矿、炼铁、炼钢、轧钢等共有一百多项。在鞍山附近的群山中，今年将要进行几项大规模的矿山、选矿厂的建设工程；炼铁厂有两座炼铁炉今年要改建成自动化炼铁炉；第一炼钢厂今年继续进行改建，全部工程完成后，全厂的产量可比去年提高百分之二十左右。停止生产将近十年的鞍山第二选矿厂和第二烧结厂，今年也将赋予新的生命。今年属于边生产边改建、施工管理特别复杂的工程，也比往年增多了。
    为了保证这些工程按期完工，鞍钢的建设者们今年将全面地、系统地学习苏联，展开全面完成国家计划的劳动竞赛，并将改进劳动组织，采取先进施工方法，减少停工和窝工现象，扩大计件工资的范围等重大措施。
