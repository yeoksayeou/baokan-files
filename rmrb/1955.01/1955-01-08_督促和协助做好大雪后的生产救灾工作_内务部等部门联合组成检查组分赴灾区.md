Xinhua News Agency, 7th. To urge and assist provinces that have suffered from floods to do a good job in post-snow production and disaster relief work, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Health, the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and the Red Cross Society of China have jointly formed disaster area work inspection teams. The inspection teams decided to set off on the 8th to inspect and assist in the disaster-stricken areas of Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi and other provinces.

Since late December of last year, most areas of Anhui, Hubei, Jiangsu, Hebei, and Henan provinces, as well as the Dongting Lake area in northern Hunan and the Poyang Lake area in northern Jiangxi, have successively experienced heavy snowfall, with snow accumulation generally around one foot and reaching three feet in depth in some areas. Although the snowfall has stopped in many places, the temperature in the snowfall areas is still between minus five and fifteen degrees Celsius. Most of the Huai River and Han River are frozen, making navigation difficult; lakes and small rivers are also frozen, preventing navigation. Roads are covered with snow, and transportation is also affected. Disaster victims engaged in sideline production activities outdoors have also been suspended due to the snow blocking their doors. This heavy snow has brought new difficulties to the disaster victims in these areas.

Party and government leading organs in various localities have taken active measures to solve the difficulties of disaster victims after the snow.

In order to urge the affected provinces to do a good job in disaster relief work after the heavy snow, on January 5, responsible comrades from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Health, and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives held a meeting in the Ministry of Internal Affairs to study solutions. Responsible comrades from various departments, in their speeches, expressed extreme concern and importance to the work in disaster areas, and unanimously stated that they would distribute disaster relief funds well and actively support disaster victims through their own business systems to overcome the difficulties of the cold winter. The meeting finally decided that the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Health, the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives and other departments would send a total of forty-five cadres, including division chiefs, bureau chiefs, and section chiefs, to form disaster area work inspection teams to go to the disaster-stricken provinces to inspect and assist in the work.

Before departure, Xie Juezai, Minister of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, convened a meeting of all staff members of the disaster area work inspection team to convey the principles, policies and measures of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on production and disaster relief.

    督促和协助做好大雪后的生产救灾工作
    内务部等部门联合组成检查组分赴灾区
    【新华社七日讯】为了督促和协助曾遭受水灾省份做好大雪之后的生产救灾工作，内务部、农业部、财政部、卫生部、中华全国供销合作总社和中国人民救济总会已经联合组成灾区工作检查组。检查组决定八日启程分赴安徽、湖北、湖南、江苏、江西等省受灾地区视察并协助工作。
    去年十二月下旬以来，安徽、湖北、江苏、河北、河南等省大部地区和湖南北部洞庭湖地区、江西北部鄱阳湖地区，先后连降大雪，一般积雪在一尺左右，深的达三尺。目前许多地方降雪虽然已经停止，但下雪地区的气温仍在零下五度到十五度。淮河、汉江大部结冰，行船困难；湖泊、小河也因封冻，不能通航。公路积雪，交通也受到影响。在室外进行副业生产活动的灾民，也因大雪封门而停顿。此次大雪，给这些地区的灾民带来了新的困难。
    对雪后灾民的困难，各地党政领导机关已采取积极措施正在加以解决。
    为了督促有灾各省做好大雪以后的救灾工作，一月五日，内务部、农业部、粮食部、财政部、卫生部和中华全国供销合作总社负责同志在内务部开会，研究解决办法。各部门负责同志在发言中，极为关怀和重视灾区工作，一致表示要发放好救灾款项，并通过本身业务系统，积极支持灾民度过寒冬困难。会议最后确定由内务部、农业部、财政部、卫生部、中华全国供销合作总社等部门派出司长、局长、科长等干部共四十五人组成灾区工作检查组，分赴灾区省份检查和协助工作。
    出发之前，内务部谢觉哉部长又召集灾区工作检查组全体工作人员开会，传达了中共中央和国务院关于生产救灾的方针政策和措施。
