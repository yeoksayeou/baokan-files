The heinous merchant Yue Bin, who stole and sold precious cultural relics, has now been punished by law. Yue Bin was an antique dealer exposed by the people during the "Five-Anti" campaign. Subsequently, many carving workers, cultural relic workers, archaeologists, and the general public further revealed Yue Bin's serious crimes of stealing precious historical relics of the motherland, and demanded that the People's Government impose severe legal sanctions.

According to materials confirmed by the Beijing Municipal People's Court after a long period of investigation: Over the past thirty years, Yue Bin colluded with more than a dozen imperialist elements to amass a large number of important cultural relics from our country. While stealing historical relics in Luoyang, Xuchang, Anyang, Taiyuan, Datong, Jinan, Qingdao, Shijiazhuang, and other places, he also hired hooligans who did not hesitate to smash the relics. For example, after Alan Priest discovered the world-renowned "Empress Worshipping Buddha" statue in the Longmen Grottoes in 1934, he and Yue Bin signed a contract to steal it together. Yue Bin then hired local thieves such as Ma Longtu and others to chisel all the relics into stone fragments with iron drills, transported them to Beijing, repaired them by gluing, and then smuggled them to the United States. The carvings in the Longmen Grottoes are a great artistic masterpiece of our country and one of our precious cultural heritages, and the two "Empress Worshipping Buddha" statues built during the Northern Wei Dynasty, each six feet high and twelve feet wide, were among the most outstanding works, but they were stolen and sold by Yue Bin.

During the investigation of Yue Bin's crimes by the Beijing Municipal People's Court, the remaining stolen relics amounted to 15,339 pieces, including 4,979 pieces of historical relics with important artistic value and 2,431 pieces of historical relics with general artistic value.

Yue Bin's crimes have caused irreparable damage to our country's cultural heritage of thousands of years.

The Beijing Municipal People's Court believes that the criminal's circumstances were heinous and the consequences were extremely serious. On November 8th of last year, the court sentenced the criminal to death with a two-year reprieve in accordance with the law. (Tang Zhanyun)

    盗窃珍贵文物的奸商岳彬受严惩
    盗卖珍贵文物的奸商岳彬，现已受到法律惩办。岳彬是“五反”运动中被人民检举的古玩奸商。以后，许多雕刻工作者、文物工作者、考古工作者和广大读者，进一步揭发岳彬盗窃祖国珍贵历史文物的严重罪行，并要求人民政府给予严厉的法律制裁。
    根据北京市人民法院经长期调查的材料证实：岳彬在三十余年来，曾勾结帝国主义分子十数人，大量搜罗我国重要文物，在洛阳、许昌、安阳、太原、大同、济南、青岛、石家庄等地盗窃历史文物时，更收买流氓分子，不惜将文物打碎。比如爱伦·普利斯在一九三四年发现我国举世闻名的龙门石雕中的“王后礼佛图”造像后，便和岳彬订立共同盗窃的契约，岳彬就收买当地盗窃分子马龙图等多人，将全部文物用铁钻凿碎成石片，运到北京，再进行粘修，然后偷运到美国。龙门石窟中的雕刻是我国伟大的艺术杰作，是我国珍贵文化遗产之一，而北魏时所建的各高六尺、宽十二尺的两幅“王后礼佛图”造像又是其中最优秀的作品之一，竟被岳彬这样的盗卖了。
    北京市人民法院对岳彬的罪行进行调查时，检查出盗卖剩余的文物即达一万五千三百三十九件，其中有重要艺术价值的历史文物四千九百七十九件，有一般艺术价值的历史文物二千四百三十一件。
    岳彬的罪行，使我国数千年来的文化遗产，遭受了无法弥补的损失。
    北京市人民法院认为该犯犯罪情节恶劣，后果十分严重，已在去年十一月八日依法判处该犯死刑、缓期二年执行。（唐占蕴）
