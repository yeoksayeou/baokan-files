    Last year, the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative developed the catering industry and various service businesses in the newly built districts and industrial and mining areas. By the end of last year, cooperatives in these areas had developed a total of 107 catering and service business units. These included noodle stalls, cooperative canteens, barber shops, sewing departments, laundry and dyeing departments, photography departments, bathhouses, car repair shops, clock repair shops, shoe repair shops, and fountain pen repair shops. Cooperative canteens can generally accommodate between 100 and 200 people at the same time, with the largest accommodating more than 300 people; the barber shop in Guandongdian in the eastern suburbs has 40 seats and is currently the largest barber shop in Beijing. The establishment of these new service business units has greatly benefited the vast number of workers, students, and others in the newly built districts and industrial and mining areas.

    首都新建区新型的饭馆和澡堂
    北京市供销合作总社去年在新建区和工矿区发展了饮食业和各项服务性业务。到去年年底止，这些地区的合作社共发展饮食业和服务性业务单位一百零七处。其中包括面食摊、合作食堂、理发室、缝纫部、洗染部、照像部、洗澡堂、修车处、修理钟表部、修鞋部、修理金笔部等。合作食堂一般都能同时容纳一百人到二百人，最大的能容纳三百多人；东郊关东店的理发部有四十个座位，是目前北京市规模最大的理发馆。这些新型服务性业务单位的建立，使新建区和工矿区广大职工和学生等得到很大便利。
