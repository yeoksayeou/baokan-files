Editor's Note: The semi-socialist natured Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative has now transitioned to a fully socialist advanced cooperative, and has been named the "Road to Happiness" Agricultural Production Cooperative. This article describes the experiences of the Bao'an Village Party organization in political and ideological work within the original Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative.

Starting from Solving Ideological Problems
——Experiences of the CPC Jiaohe County Bao'an Village Branch in Leading the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement
Shang Kai

Bao'an Village is a village in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, composed of five natural hamlets with a total of one hundred and thirty-eight households. As of the end of 1954, all but one landlord household and six rich peasant households in the village had joined the Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative. The cooperative's production developed rapidly. During the puppet Manchukuo period, the highest yield per hectare in Bao'an Village was 2,000 catties, but in the first year of the establishment of the agricultural production cooperative—1952—the yield per hectare increased to 5,500 catties. Even though it suffered from a frost disaster in 1953, the yield per hectare was still no less than 5,000 catties. With the development of production, the actual income of cooperative members increased significantly, and material and cultural life improved remarkably. In 1953, the income of old cooperative members generally increased by 30 to 40 percent compared to 1952, while the income of new cooperative members increased by one to two times compared to before joining the cooperative. The miserable conditions of living in leaky houses, wearing burlap sacks, and begging with children had long become a memory of the past, and the vast majority of cooperative members lived a life of plenty. Among them, forty-two cooperative member households had already moved into spacious and bright new homes with glass doors and windows. All ninety-nine school-age children in the village were enrolled in school, and eighty-four male and female cooperative members regularly studied in night schools. During festivals and grand gatherings, cooperative members could watch cultural performances staged by themselves. New ideological awareness among cooperative members was also slowly growing. Many cooperative members were rewarded for their love of labor, love of the collective, and care for public property. "Responding to the call of the state, supporting the socialist industrialization of the country" was no longer just a political slogan but had become the practical action of cooperative members. In 1953, they sold more than 100,000 catties of surplus grain to the state, and in 1954, they expanded the planting area of rice and oil crops according to the needs of the state. Although they suffered from a frost disaster later, they were still able to sell 300,000 to 400,000 catties of surplus grain to the state. Every family in the cooperative raised pigs, and every household raised chickens and ducks. This year, they also sold 15,000 catties of pork and more than 26,000 chicken and duck eggs to the state.

At the National Rural Party Grassroots Organization Work Conference, Chi Dianwen, deputy secretary of the CPC Bao'an Village Branch [Note], after introducing these situations, immediately introduced the situation of their branch leading the mutual aid and cooperative movement. From Chi Dianwen's simple and vivid narration, people saw a vivid picture of the Party leading all farmers on the road to socialism.

Leading Everyone on the Broad Road of Socialism

In the early spring of 1952, the Han En agricultural production mutual aid group, after a whole winter of ideological mobilization, was transformed into an agricultural production cooperative. Before the excited mood of the cooperative members had calmed down, a debate arose within the cooperative regarding the issue of the cooperative's management policy—whether to focus on agricultural production or on sideline occupations or commerce. This caused great ideological fluctuations among Party members and the masses. Zhao Qin, who had just risen from a poor peasant to a well-to-do middle peasant, firmly advocated hitching up all the carts and horses to haul goods. He said, "Our cooperative can't make it just by relying on this little land. It's faster to make money by hauling goods. Eight carts can earn 1.5 million in a day, which is equivalent to the income of half a hectare of land. You don't have to plow, plant, or weed, and you'll have food and drink." Chi Dianwu, a new middle peasant, proposed an even more attractive idea, suggesting that in addition to hauling goods, they should also go to the areas of Yushu and Shulan to trade horses. He said, "Take the train there, ride the horses back, and you can earn 2 million per horse. You don't need many, just ten horses is 20 million." This immediately caused a stir among the cooperative members, who said, "This is really a good idea," and "As long as it makes money, it's fine."

The branch committee held a meeting to study this issue. The branch's understanding of this issue was clear. Because during the establishment of the cooperative, the county party committee had repeatedly instructed them that the agricultural production cooperative must focus on developing agricultural production, and the sign of a well-run cooperative was producing more grain. The unanimous opinion at the branch committee meeting was: "Adhere to the Party's policy, and adhere to the management policy of focusing on agriculture." However, the thoughts of the masses butted heads with the Party's policy. Hauling goods and trading horses was no longer just the opinion of a few people, but had almost become the opinion of all cooperative members, and even some Communist Party members agreed with this approach. The branch committee believed: "To solve the ideological problems of the masses, we must first unify ideological understanding within the Party."

During the branch member meeting to discuss the issue of hauling goods and trading horses, the commercial speculative thinking of some Party members was immediately exposed. Zhang Baojin said first, "Whether it's hauling goods or trading horses, I agree with all of it." Branch Secretary Han En asked everyone to consider whether this approach was in line with the Party's policy. Zhang Baojin immediately defended his opinion, saying, "Isn't the purpose of increasing income to run the cooperative well? I think hauling goods and trading horses is a good way to increase income." Zhang Jichen also helped, saying, "Hauling goods is earning money through labor, and trading horses is earning money through discernment. How can it not be in line with the Party's policy?" Zhang Jisheng immediately replied, "The Party's policy is to let us develop agricultural production and produce more grain, not to have us buy and sell horses for speculation." Han En also explained it to him. The other Party members also spoke up, one saying, "The Party cannot lead cooperative members to engage in speculation, not even one horse leg can be bought," and another saying, "We must develop agricultural production, not think about those crooked ways." At this time, Zhang Baojin also felt that his reasons were not sufficient, but he was unwilling to admit his mistake. He said, "The cooperative members all want to haul goods and trade horses, and the branch should accept the opinions of the masses." Branch Deputy Secretary Chi Dianwen then explained to him, "If the opinions of the masses are correct, we should accept them. If they are incorrect, we should explain them to the masses. The Party must lead the masses, and the Party cannot run behind the masses." Zhang Baojin could not argue with everyone, so he lost his temper. He said, "Are we afraid of money burning our hands?" This immediately aroused opposition from Chen Guifang and Zhang Shukun, who said, "It's not that we're afraid of money burning our hands, but because that's money that comes from speculation. If you do that, you might as well go rob!" Zhang Baojin got angry: "Even if I rob, it's for the sake of the masses." The meeting lasted until midnight, and Zhang Baojin's thinking still had not been straightened out. At the branch member meeting held the next day, everyone explained to Zhang Baojin many principles regarding agricultural production cooperatives focusing on agricultural production. Branch Secretary Han En especially patiently said to Zhang Baojin, "We are an agricultural production cooperative, and expanding agricultural production is our direction of development. During the slack season, carts and horses can go out to haul goods and increase the cooperative's income, which is acceptable. But now it is spring plowing, which is the time when we need people and livestock. If we hitch up all the carts and horses to haul goods, the land will not be well planted, and we will not be able to produce more grain. As for buying and selling horses, that is an act of speculation and is even more wrong." Zhang Baojin was silent, and a fierce struggle unfolded in his mind. At this time, Han En also told him that in the past, during the mutual aid group period, because the branch's policies and thinking were not clear, they had repeatedly made mistakes such as hiring labor, lending money, selling crops before harvest, and renting out livestock. For example, in the autumn of 1950, there was a bumper harvest of sunflower seeds, and if they were bought and sold in the spring of the following year, they could be doubled in profit. At that time, both Party members and non-Party members advocated hoarding sunflower seeds. The branch asked the county party committee for instructions, and the county party committee pointed out that this was an act of speculation. If the higher-level Party committee had not pointed out and corrected these mistakes in time, we might have already embarked on the capitalist road. Now you advocate trading horses, isn't this the same mistake as the idea of selling sunflower seeds in the past? The phrase "the capitalist road" startled Zhang Baojin. He recalled that he himself had suffered exploitation and oppression in the past, and had only been wealthy for a few days, but now he wanted to take the old capitalist road and exploit others. Wasn't this forgetting his roots? After he figured it out, he said to everyone: "I was wrong."

After ideological consensus was reached within the Party, the branch convened a meeting of all cooperative cadres and activists through the cooperative management committee to further criticize the capitalist thinking existing within the cooperative and continue to implement the management policy of focusing on agricultural production. At the beginning of the meeting, many cadres were still confidently defending hauling goods and trading horses, believing that this was "seeking benefits for cooperative members." However, after repeated persuasion and explanation by Party members and cooperative cadres, the vast majority of cadres accepted the Party's management policy of focusing on agricultural production. After the meeting, Party members and cooperative cadres conducted extensive and in-depth publicity among cooperative members. By the time the cooperative member meeting was convened, the masses had matured ideologically. They unanimously supported the Party's call, expressed that they would concentrate on learning agricultural technology, improve agricultural production, and take the socialist road. Cooperative member Niu Defang resolutely stated: "I will no longer think about doing business. This year, I will compete with you in production." At this time, it was already the time of spring in March, and the earth was thawing. The cooperative members threw themselves into the upsurge of spring plowing.

This year, the cooperative's crops suffered from a severe hailstorm. After the Party branch led all cooperative members to carry out rescue, the yield of rice reached more than 11,000 catties per hectare during the autumn harvest, creating a miracle of a bumper harvest after the disaster. But new problems arose again. In the spring of 1953, a few individual households, because they had suffered from disasters for two consecutive years, were particularly difficult and wanted to sell their land. Their land was flat and the price was cheap, only a few hundred thousand yuan per hectare. Some cooperative members became envious, some saying, "The cooperative has a lot of money, we should buy land," others saying, "Our cooperative doesn't have enough land to cultivate, we can produce more grain by buying more land," and some saying, "Buy more flat land, it's easy to use new agricultural tools now, and we can run tractors in the future." Some cooperative members saw that the cooperative was not buying, so they advocated buying it themselves. Cooperative member Gao Chenghe and his wife calculated all night and came up with a good idea: it would be better to use more than one million yuan of surplus funds to buy a few hectares of land and put it into the cooperative, giving a remuneration of one stone of grain per hectare, and they could get their capital and interest back home in three years. It was beneficial to themselves and not detrimental to the cooperative. The more Gao Chenghe thought about it, the more he thought it was worthwhile, and decided to buy six hectares of land.

The new situation of land sales in Bao'an Village attracted the attention of the Party branch committee members. The branch committee held a special meeting to check and believed that the Bao'an Village had been liberated for more than five years, and the phenomenon of selling land had occurred again, and the Party branch should be primarily responsible. After research, the branch committee believed that it was not only necessary to persuade cooperative members not to take advantage of others' difficulties and buy the land of poor brothers at low prices, but more importantly, to persuade cooperative members to actively help them solve their difficulties. Therefore, the branch decided to educate all cooperative members by educating Gao Chenghe. When the branch sent someone to talk to Gao Chenghe, Gao Chenghe had not yet realized his mistake. He said, "Hiring labor is exploitation, lending money and selling crops before harvest are exploitation, but how can buying land be considered exploitation?" The branch patiently said to him: "Old Gao, you say that buying land is not exploitation. Put the land you bought into the cooperative and eat rent. Where does the rent come from? Isn't it from the labor of all the cooperative members?" And they said to him: "If you have money to buy all the land of the poor households, isn't this going to let these poor brothers go to work hard for the rich peasants and be exploited?" These words touched Gao Chenghe's heart, causing him to recall that in the past he had no land and no soil, and took his wife and children to Haicheng to work hard for the landlord. Later, he moved to Bao'an Village and took the road of mutual aid and cooperation under the leadership of the Party, and only then did he have the life he has today. Why didn't I follow the road the Party pointed out for me, but insisted on developing a new rich peasant? Finally, Gao Chenghe resolutely told the Party: "From now on, I will plunge headfirst into the Party's embrace and listen to the Party. I will never take detours again." At the cooperative member meeting, when the Party branch criticized the cooperative members' mistaken thinking of buying land, Gao Chenghe also voluntarily made a self-criticism. The cooperative members then realized: "We almost took the wrong path again." Everyone unanimously agreed with the branch's opinion and took out 2,500 catties of soybean cake and 2 million yuan in cash from the cooperative's public accumulation fund to lend to poor households outside the cooperative to overcome difficulties in production and life.

"With the development of the cooperative's production and the increase in cooperative members' income, it is even more necessary to strengthen socialist education for cooperative members." This is the most practical experience of the Bao'an Village Branch. In the summer of 1953, the cooperative's crops were growing vigorously, and a bumper harvest was just around the corner. At this time, Chi Dianwu's long-dormant idea of withdrawing from the cooperative revived. He secretly calculated his own small calculations: this year, my whole family can get 400 workdays. Calculated at 30,000 yuan per workday, I can get 12 million yuan. Then take out 2 million yuan of the share capital, which is enough to hitch up a rubber-tired cart. At that time, withdrawing from the cooperative to haul goods will be quick to make money, and I won't have to be restricted everywhere in the cooperative, where I can't buy or sell anything. Party member Cui Hai lived in the same house as Chi Dianwu, and he understood Chi Dianwu's thoughts thoroughly. Cui Hai reported it to the Party branch in a timely manner. The branch believed that this must not be treated as an individual problem, because before this, it had been discovered that cooperative members Jin Zezhu and Pu Gentai also had the idea of withdrawing from the cooperative after the autumn harvest. If education is not carried out in time, this kind of thinking will continue to spread. Chi Dianwen was Chi Dianwu's cousin, so the Party branch decided that Chi Dianwen would be responsible for educating Chi Dianwu. One day, Chi Dianwen met Chi Dianwu and asked him if he was planning to withdraw from the cooperative. Chi Dianwu denied it. Later, Branch Secretary Han En, branch committee member Yuan Jifang and others also went to talk to Chi Dianwu one after another. Although Chi Dianwu verbally admitted that taking the road of cooperation was correct, he still believed in his heart that withdrawing from the cooperative to haul goods was worthwhile. The branch found that Chi Dianwu usually believed Niu Defang's words the most, so they asked Niu Defang to persuade him. Niu Defang said to Chi Dianwu, "In the past, my old mind suffered a lot. Why do you want to take the road back now?" Then Niu Defang cited the example of Zhu Fengshan going bankrupt because of hauling goods and doing business. Niu Defang's words made Chi Dianwu's idea of withdrawing from the cooperative somewhat waver, but he was not completely dead set on it. When the autumn harvest season arrived, the Party branch vigorously promoted the general line throughout the village. "Transforming small-scale peasant economy" and "taking the road of cooperation" went straight into Chi Dianwu's ears. Chi Dianwu thought to himself: "Bao'an Village has a model worker, Han En, and only then is the general line implemented. It's probably that other places won't implement the general line." So he wrote eight or nine letters in a row and sent them to relatives and friends living in Jilin City, Shulan County and other places, asking them whether they also had a "general line" there? "Are we going to take the road of cooperation?" Soon, relatives and friends from all over sent back letters one after another, all telling him: "The general line is being implemented everywhere in the country, and we are all taking the road of cooperation," and advised him not to withdraw from the cooperative. At this time, Chi Dianwu's son, Chi Guishan, after being educated by the Party, also recognized his father's mistake and persuaded his father not to withdraw from the cooperative. Chi Dianwu then decided not to withdraw from the cooperative, and said: "I will stay in Bao'an Village until we reach socialist society."

Cooperative members like to call the cooperative's public property "socialist family property," and everyone is very concerned about the continuous growth of "socialist family property." Now the cooperative's public property has expanded to more than 300 million yuan, which is far more than the private property of the cooperative members. The branch committee often educates cooperative members that this is our guarantee for developing towards the socialist road. With the continuous expansion of public property, the branch has never forgotten to educate cooperative members to gradually reduce non-labor remuneration within the cooperative and create conditions for transitioning to an advanced agricultural production cooperative with full remuneration according to labor. When the cooperative was first established in early 1952, the branch's understanding of this issue was not very clear, and the non-labor remuneration within the cooperative was set too high; the land rent per hectare was one stone and two dou, and the share capital interest was 3% per annum. This year, after Han En visited the Soviet collective farm, he realized that if the non-labor remuneration of the agricultural cooperative was set too high, it would affect the growth of socialist factors within the cooperative. Han En came back and discussed it with the branch, and asked the county party committee for instructions, and decided to gradually reduce the remuneration for land etc. on the condition of gradually increasing the income of cooperative members. In the first year, the land remuneration was reduced by two dou, and the interest was reduced by two li. At that time, not many people invested in the agricultural cooperative. After publicity and education, and under the influence of Han En and Chi Dianwen taking the lead, the branch's proposal to reduce non-labor remuneration was agreed by everyone. In 1953, at a meeting before the autumn harvest distribution, the branch committee decided to strive to reduce the rent per hectare by another two dou, and reduce the interest by another eight li. This year, more cooperative members invested, and the branch estimated that this reduction in interest would cause a sharp ideological struggle. The branch first gathered cooperative members with a lot of land and large investments to have a discussion. The first one to oppose it was Liang Naitang, who said angrily: "Anyway, you want to take action against me. I don't want my investment of more than 10 million yuan, let everyone divide it up." The discussion was not fruitful, so the branch decided to use the method of specific accounting to get through Liang Naitang's thinking. At the second discussion meeting, Branch Secretary Han En and others showed Liang Naitang by moving the abacus: if you have 3.6 hectares of land and 11.5 million yuan of share capital, calculated according to reducing the rent by two dou and the dividend by eight li, you will only earn 1.2 million yuan less. On the other hand, this year, relying on the labor of the cooperative members, you have newly opened up 5 hectares of rice paddies. The income from these 5 hectares of rice paddies can make each workday an extra 7,000 yuan. Your whole family worked a total of 400 workdays this year, and you can earn an extra 2.8 million yuan. By comparison, you will actually increase your income by 1.6 million yuan. Liang Naitang was not completely enlightened, so Han En calculated the second account for him. Because the whole cooperative reduced the land rent and interest, each workday can earn an extra 2,500 yuan; your 400 workdays can earn an extra 1 million yuan. When he calculated to this point, Liang Naitang smiled and said: "I have no objection." Other cooperative members also calculated their accounts. Although they reduced non-labor remuneration, everyone's income increased compared to the previous year.

Educating Cooperative Members to Love the Cooperative as They Love Their Homes

"If there is no water in the big river, the small river will dry up" is a popular saying in the Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative. The cooperative members compare the cooperative to the big river and themselves to the small river, closely combining the individual and the collective. Once, young cooperative member Chang Shougui drove a cart to the county granary to deliver grain. While unloading the grain, a young man came over and picked up the whip, "whack, whack, whack" hitting it three times. Chang Shougui put down the grain bag on his shoulder, ran over, said "Comrade, sorry!" and took the whip away. The young man was very surprised and said: "Very bossy, can't even hit the whip a few times?" Chang Shougui immediately explained to him: "For the sake of increasing production and practicing economy, our team has a meeting that it is not allowed to waste one whip. It doesn't matter if you hit it a few times, it wastes hundreds of yuan."

Comrade Chi Dianwen, the deputy secretary of the branch, has a deep understanding of these changes in cooperative members' ideological awareness. He said: "People's hearts have really changed greatly." Take Chang Shougui as an example, he is now a member of the Communist Youth League, and he has been rewarded by the cooperative management committee because he loves labor and obeys discipline. However, who would have thought that two years ago he was still a serious selfish individual? At that time, the agricultural cooperative had just been established, and one day some visitors came. Carelessly, they trampled to death a chick that had just hatched in Chang Shougui's house. Chang Shougui's wife made a big fuss, and in the end, the cooperative had to compensate him for a chick. Not long after, when Chang Shougui was driving a cart to deliver manure, he deliberately injured one of the horse's eyes. At that time, he thought: "If it dies, I'll only have to pay a little money anyway, and it won't cost my head."

The Party branch held a meeting to analyze the ideological situation of the cooperative members. The branch believed that the selfish thoughts of the cooperative members were widespread and serious. The incident of Chang Shougui injuring the horse's eye was a prominent manifestation of this kind of thinking. If handled well, it can educate all cooperative members, if not handled well, more serious incidents will occur. At that time, the masses also reflected: "If this is just dropped like this, it's okay if someone kills a horse in the future." The branch decided that Chi Dianwen would be responsible for educating Chang Shougui. At first, Chang Shougui's attitude was still very tough, and he said: "I have money, I can compensate." Chi Dianwen severely criticized his wrong attitude, and then patiently said to him: "Shougui, how can you not make good progress! Now let's count these young people in our cooperative who are about the same age as you. They are all making progress very quickly, and they have also joined the League. Niu Zhengcai is active and responsible in production, and runs ahead in everything; Niu Guizhi is an eighteen-year-old girl and has a high prestige among women. Han Yukun and Han Yuchen are also making progress very quickly. Let's look at the younger children, none of them don't know how to protect public property. Even the old men in their fifties and sixties are also actively working. What are you planning to do?" Chang Shougui was a proud person. He had already felt uneasy because he saw that others had joined the League, but he was still outside the League. Now Chi Dianwen's words had hit his sore spot. He pondered for a long time and suddenly said: "Okay, I will clean up the mess I caused myself. If I don't make progress in the future, don't pay attention to me again." Later, he voluntarily made a self-criticism at the cooperative member meeting, requesting the cooperative to deduct ten workdays from him to compensate for the cooperative's losses. The cooperative members were satisfied with his self-criticism.

In 1953, during the preparation for spring plowing, the cooperative decided to mobilize cooperative members to carry out general seed selection, and stipulated that one workday would be recorded for every 100 catties selected. Cooperative member Old Lady Fang said: "I am old, and the cooperative takes care of me, so let me earn more workdays." So she took 300 catties of soybean seeds. Five days later, Old Lady Fang's selected soybean seeds were completed. Not only were they selected cleanly, but there was no loss of even one liang per catty. However, unexpectedly, when it was poured into the warehouse, the secret was revealed. It turned out that she only selected 30 catties to cover the top, and the ones below were not selected at all. Old Lady Fang's deception aroused dissatisfaction among everyone, and even more attracted the attention of the branch. Before this, it had been discovered that cooperative members Cui Yushan and his brothers had stolen wood and vermicelli from the cooperative, cooperative member Jin Tieshan had stolen soybean cake from the cooperative to feed his own pigs, and cooperative member Fang Zhongyuan had broken a cow's leg. The branch believed that although these things were not big, if education was not carried out in time, they would become serious if they developed.

On the other hand, the collectivist thinking and the concept of protecting public property among cooperative members also increased. Communist Party member Yang Chengxue was driving two horses pulling a weeder to the field one day when the horses suddenly ran away. Seeing that the weeder was about to injure the horse's legs, Yang Chengxue had no time to consider his own safety in this emergency. He wrapped the reins around his arm and tightly stayed behind. The horse couldn't run anymore and retreated, Yang Chengxue fell, and a hoof stepped over, and a wound immediately appeared on the right side of Yang Chengxue's face, with blood flowing out. At this time, Yang Chengxue ignored the pain, got up in a hurry, and drove the horse back to the stable. He said: "Even if my head is stepped off, I can't let go. Breaking two horses is 6 to 7 million yuan!" Five days later, everyone saw him working in the field again.

The Party branch decided to conduct a collectivist education for cooperative members through these two things. At the cooperative member meeting, Yang Chengxue's model act of protecting public property was first commended and was warmly welcomed by all cooperative members. Everyone raised the slogan of "Learning from Yang Chengxue." The meeting also criticized the selfish behavior of Old Lady Fang and Jin Tieshan and others. After the meeting, these two things were discussed in units of each production team, and inspections were carried out in connection with their own thinking. Team Leader Yu Yongxing of the Third Team inspected himself and found that when he saw some cooperative members damaging public property, he always thought, "What's the point of offending this person? How much will I have to pay?" and let it go. He said: "I must change this wrong idea." Communist Party member Cui Hai also checked that his concept of protecting public property was very poor. He said: "Once, when I was testing new agricultural tools, I dropped the wrench on the ground, and I didn't report it to the cooperative. Later, when someone picked it up and asked me, I pretended not to know and was unwilling to admit it." After discussion, some good cooperative members who loved and protected public property were also discovered among the cooperative members. Zhang Shixian, the deputy leader of the First Production Team, told a story at the discussion meeting: After the cooperative was established, no one was willing to graze the cattle, because they thought it was too much trouble. Xu Fengshan took the initiative to take on the task. He drove more than 50 cattle every day, leaving early and returning late, in the wind and rain, climbing slopes and crossing ridges, and looking for grass sources everywhere. Later, seven or eight calves were added. Xu Fengshan guarded them day and night. When the calves fell asleep on the hillside, he would pull some green grass and cover them. When the calves woke up, he would give them clear water to drink. Under his careful care, the cattle never suffered any losses. One day, when a cow was eating grass on the hillside, it suddenly gave birth to a calf. It was very far from the village, and there was no one to call. Xu Fengshan took off his clothes and wrapped the calf. After Zhang Shixian finished telling the story, he went on to examine himself and said, "The most important property in our team is livestock. If one horse is fed badly, we will lose 2 to 3 million yuan, but I have rarely inspected the work of raising livestock. My love for public property is far from being as good as Xu Fengshan's." He said that he must strengthen his sense of responsibility in the future. Xu Fengshan's story of loving livestock deeply moved the cooperative member Gao Fengming, who was nearly 60 years old. He swore to everyone like this: "Look, I will learn from Yang Chengxue and Xu Fengshan in the future. I will love the cooperative as I love my own home."

Gao Fengming's oath quickly turned into action. Gao Fengming's family had more than 20 catties of good flax, which he had accumulated little by little over five years, preparing to make shoes for his daughter-in-law when she got married. In the past, someone had borrowed from him, but he had never agreed. At this time, the cooperative urgently needed flax for production, and they couldn't buy it, so they asked Gao Fengming if he could sell some flax to the cooperative. Gao Fengming laughed and said: "Didn't I say long ago that I would treat the cooperative as my own home—take it if the cooperative needs it." Gao Fengming took the flax down from the ceiling, and wrapped it in five or six layers of burlap. When he opened it, it was really good flax, white and long, a full 26 catties. The cooperative cadre asked him: "Old man Gao, how much do you want per catty?" Gao Fengming said: "The price of the supply and marketing cooperative is 10,000 yuan per catty, let's calculate this at 8,000 yuan, anyway, it is produced from my own land." After the cooperative cadre calculated it, such a good quality flax could not be bought for 15,000 yuan on the market, so they decided to give him 13,000 yuan per catty and commended Gao Fengming's model action of selflessness and serving the public throughout the cooperative.

Handling Problems According to Class Policy

Anyone who has visited the Bao'an Village Agricultural Production Cooperative will get a clear impression: the Party branch here has correctly implemented the Party's class line in the agricultural cooperation movement. Comrade Chi Dianwen, deputy secretary of the Party branch, said very clearly about this issue: "Our branch has a total of 19 Party members, 18 of whom are from hired poor peasant backgrounds. Lao Han and I have both worked hard for landlords for six or seven years, so we are most likely to understand the significance of relying on poor peasants (including new middle peasants who were originally poor peasants), consolidating the unity of middle peasants, and restricting and gradually eliminating the rich peasant economy." During the period of leading the land reform struggle, the Party branch paid attention to cultivating poor peasant leading cadres, so that the mutual aid group to the agricultural cooperative has always maintained the leadership advantage of poor peasants. At the same time, the Party branch also fought against thoughts and behaviors that despise poor peasants and infringe on the interests of middle peasants at any time.

When the agricultural production cooperative was first established, three old middle peasant households joined the cooperative with complete sets of carts and horses. When discussing the valuation of carts and horses, emotions of infringing on the interests of middle peasants arose. Poor peasant cooperative member Liu Deyi advocated lowering the prices of carts and horses of middle peasant cooperative members. Many poor peasant cooperative members also agreed with this approach. This caused unease among middle peasant cooperative members. At the same time, middle peasant cooperative member Niu Defang put forward another opinion: to generally raise the prices of carts and horses. Middle peasant cooperative members all agreed with Niu Defang's opinion, which caused unease among households without carts and horses. After the Party branch discovered this, it immediately conducted education on class policy for all cooperative members, pointing out that only when poor peasants and middle peasants unite can they fight against rich peasants, and explaining that lowering the prices of carts and horses of middle peasants infringed on the interests of middle peasant cooperative members, and generally raising the prices of carts and horses would put poor peasant cooperative members at a disadvantage. These are all wrong approaches and will affect the unity of poor peasants and middle peasants. The cooperative members accepted the Party branch's opinion and reasonably handled the issue of carts and horses being valued and joining the cooperative. Finally, cooperative cadres were elected. The director of the cooperative and the production team leaders were all held by poor peasant cooperative members, and two middle peasant cooperative members were also elected as deputy production team leaders. After the establishment of the cooperative, both poor peasant and middle peasant cooperative members were very satisfied. They advertised everywhere: "The Party's policy is correct, and joining the cooperative is not a disadvantage at all."

Not long after the establishment of the cooperative, the incident of middle peasant cooperative member Chang Shougui beating poor peasant cooperative member Yu He occurred. Once, it was Chang Shougui's turn to cut grass to feed the horses, but Chang Shougui did not go, and the breeder Yu He criticized him. Chang Shougui did not accept the criticism and said: "The cooperative is all my family property, you, a bare pole who joined the cooperative, why should you criticize me." He kicked Yu He and punched Yu He twice, and said that Yu He cursed him. Yu He was so angry that he fell ill for five days and proposed to withdraw from the cooperative. He said: "I will no longer be bullied by wealthy cooperative members." After this incident occurred, it caused ideological fluctuations among the cooperative members. Some said: "Is this what you call uniting with middle peasants? Middle peasants are beating poor peasants." Others said: "Just take it, the higher-ups say to unite with middle peasants." The Party branch explained to everyone at the cooperative member meeting: "The property of the agricultural cooperative is everyone's property, and every cooperative member has a share. Poor peasant cooperative members eat by their own labor and do not take advantage of others." At the same time, it was also explained: "Carts and horses joining the cooperative have capital and interest, and the interest that carts and horses eat is the fruit of everyone's labor. If you only rely on having carts and horses, and without the labor of all cooperative members, you can't get anything." Then, Han En, on behalf of the cooperative, commended Yu He's thoughts and actions of protecting public property, and called on all cooperative members

    编者按：半社会主义性质的韩恩农业生产合作社，目前已过渡到完全社会主义性质的高级社了，并命名为“幸福之路”农业生产合作社。这篇通讯记述的是保安村的党组织在原韩恩农业生产合作社中的政治思想工作的经验。
    从解决思想问题着手
    ——中共蛟河县保安村支部领导互助合作运动的经验
    商恺
    保安村是吉林省蛟河县的一个村庄，由五个自然屯组成，共有一百三十八户。截至一九五四年底，全村除了一户地主和六户富农以外，全部参加了韩恩农业生产合作社。社的生产发展得很快。伪满时期保安村每垧地的最高产量是两千斤，而在农业生产合作社建立的第一年——一九五二年，每垧地的产量便提高到了五千五百斤，一九五三年虽遭受了冻灾，每垧地的产量仍不低于五千斤。随着生产的发展，社员的实际收入大大增加，物质和文化生活有了显著改善。一九五三年老社员的收入，一般都比一九五二年增加了百分之三十到四十，新社员的收入则比入社前增加了一倍到两倍。过去住漏天房、披麻包片、拉着孩子讨饭吃的凄苦景况早已成了历史的回忆，绝大部分社员过上了丰衣足食的生活。其中有四十二户社员已经搬进了镶有玻璃门窗的宽敞明亮的新住宅。全村有九十九名学龄儿童完全入了学，有八十四名男女社员常年在夜校学习，每逢节日盛会，社员们可以看到自己演出的文娱节目。社员的新的思想意识也在慢慢增长起来。许多社员由于爱劳动、爱集体、爱护公共财产而受到了奖励。“响应国家号召，支援国家社会主义工业化”，不再只是一个政治口号，已成为社员们的实际行动。一九五三年他们卖给国家余粮十万余斤，一九五四年又根据国家需要，扩大了水稻和油料作物的播种面积，后来虽然遭受了冻灾，但仍能卖给国家余粮三十万到四十万斤。全社家家养猪，户户喂鸡鸭，这一年又卖给国家猪肉一万五千斤，鸡蛋鸭蛋两万六千多个。
    在全国农村党的基层组织工作会议上，中共保安村支部〔注〕副书记迟殿文在介绍这些情况之后，就紧接着介绍了他们支部领导互助合作化运动的情形。从迟殿文的朴素而生动的叙述中，人们看到了党领导全体农民走社会主义道路的一幅活生生的图画。
    带领大家走社会主义的大道
    一九五二年初春，韩恩农业生产互助组经过整整一个冬天的思想发动，转成农业生产合作社了。当社员们兴奋的心情还没有平静下来的时候，社里就发生了关于农业社经营方针问题的争论——是以农业生产为主，还是以副业或商业为主呢？这在党员和群众的思想上引起了极大的波动。刚刚由贫农上升成富裕中农的赵勤，坚决主张拴起全部车马去拉脚。他说：“我们社光靠这点地不行，还是走车来钱快，八辆车一天挣上一百五十万，就赶上半垧地的收入，不用耕种锄割，吃喝都有了。”新中农迟殿武提的意见更是动听，他主张除了拉脚以外还要到榆树和舒兰一带去贩马。他说：“坐火车去，骑马回来，一匹就挣它二百万，不用多了，十匹就是两千万。”这就在社员中嚷嚷开了，都说“这真是好主意”，“不管怎样，来钱就行”。
    支部委员会开会研究这个问题。支部对这个问题的认识是明确的。因为在建社的时候，县委曾不止一次地指示过他们：农业生产合作社必须以发展农业生产为主，办好社的标志就是多打粮食。支部委员会议上一致的意见是：“坚持党的政策，坚持以农业为主的经营方针。”但是，群众的思想却和党的政策顶了牛。拉脚和贩马已经不是几个人的意见，几乎成为全体社员的意见了，连个别共产党员也赞成这个作法。支部委员会认为：“要解决群众的思想问题，首先要统一党内的思想认识。”
    支部党员大会讨论拉脚和贩马问题的时候，某些党员的商业投机思想，立刻暴露出来。张宝金首先说：“拉脚也好，贩马也好，我全都赞成。”支部书记韩恩让大家考虑考虑这种作法符合不符合党的政策？张宝金马上为自己的意见辩护，他说：“不是增加收入才能办好社吗？我看拉脚和贩马就是增加收入的好办法。”张继臣也帮着说：“拉脚是凭劳力挣钱，贩马是凭眼力挣钱，怎么不符合党的政策？”张继生马上回答：“党的政策是让我们发展农业生产，多打粮食，不是要我们买马卖马投机倒把。”韩恩也对他作了解释。其余的党员也说话了，这个说：“党不能领导社员去投机倒把，一根马腿也不能买。”那个说：“我们要发展农业生产，不能想那些邪门歪道。”这时候，张宝金也感到自己的理由不够充分，但是他又不愿认错，他说：“社员们都要求拉脚贩马，支部就应该接受群众的意见。”支部副书记迟殿文接着给他解释：“群众的意见要是对，我们应该接受，要是不对，我们就要向群众解释，党要领导群众，党不能跟着群众的后面跑。”张宝金说不过大家，就发脾气了，他说：“难道我们还怕钱咬手吗？”这立刻引起了陈桂芳、张树坤的反对，她们说：“不是怕钱咬手，因为那是投机倒把来的钱，你这样干，还不如去抢哩！”张宝金火了：“我抢，也是为了群众。”会议一直开到半夜，张宝金的思想始终没有打通。在第二天继续举行的支部党员大会上，大家又给张宝金讲了许多关于农业生产合作社应以农业生产为主的道理。支部书记韩恩特别耐心地对张宝金说：“我们是农业生产合作社，扩大农业生产，才是我们的发展方向。在农闲的时候，车马出外拉脚，增加社的收入是可以的，现在是春耕，正是用人用牲口的时候，如果拴起全套车马去拉脚，地就种不好，就不能多打粮食。至于买马卖马是投机倒把的行为，就更不对头了。”张宝金沉默了，脑子里展开了激烈的斗争。这时候，韩恩又给他讲述了过去在互助组时期，由于支部的政策思想不明确，曾经接连犯过雇工、放债、批青、出租牲畜等错误。比如一九五○年秋天，葵花子丰收，买了放到第二年春天卖出，就可以获利双倍。当时，党内外都主张囤积葵花子。支部请示了县委，县委指出这是投机倒把的行为。若不是上级党委及时指出并纠正了这些错误，说不定我们早已走上资本主义的道路了。现在你主张贩马，这和过去贩卖葵花子的想法不是一样错误？“资本主义的道路”这句话，使张宝金吃了一惊。他想起：他自己在过去也是受尽剥削和压迫的人，生活才富裕了几天，就想走资本主义的老路，剥削别人，这不是忘了本吗？他想通以后，对大家说：“我错了。”
    党内思想取得一致以后，支部便通过社管理委员会，召开了全社干部和积极分子会议，进一步批判社内存在的资本主义思想，继续贯彻以农业生产为主的经营方针。会议一开始，有不少干部还在那里理直气壮的为拉脚贩马进行辩护，他们认为这是“为社员谋利益”。但是，经过党员干部反复地说服解释，绝大部分干部接受了党的以农业生产为主的经营方针。会后，党员和社干部在社员中又进行了广泛深入的宣传。到了召开社员大会的时候，群众在思想上已经酝酿成熟了。一致拥护党的号召，表示要专心学习农业技术，提高农业生产，走社会主义道路。社员牛德芳坚决表示：“我再也不想倒腾买卖了，今年我要在生产上和你们比比武。”这时，已经到了阳春三月大地解冻的时候了，社员们都投入了春耕生产的热潮里。
    这一年，社里的庄稼遭受了严重的雹灾，经过党支部领导全体社员进行抢救以后，到秋收时，每垧水稻打了一万一千多斤，创造了灾后丰收的奇迹。但是新的问题又发生了。一九五三年的春天，少数单干户因为接连遭受了两年灾害，生活特别困难，要卖地。他们的土地地段平坦，价钱便宜，每垧地不过十几万元。部分社员便眼红起来，有的说：“社里有的是钱，应当买地。”有的说：“咱们社里地不够种，多买地才能多打粮食。”也有的说：“多买些平坦地，现在好使新农具，将来能跑拖拉机。”还有些社员看到社里不买，便主张自己买。社员高成和和他老婆盘算了一夜，打了个好主意：不如把一百多万元的余款，买上几垧地入到社里，一垧地给一石粮食的报酬，三年就可以本利还家了，于自己有利，于社也不吃亏。高成和越想越合算，决定买六垧地。
    保安村的买卖土地新情况，引起了党支部委员们的注意。支委会专门开会作了检查，认为保安村解放了五年多，又发生了出卖土地的现象，党支部要负主要责任。支委会经过研究以后，认为不仅要说服社员不能乘人之危，贱价收买穷兄弟的土地，更重要的是说服社员，主动地去帮助他们解决困难。于是支部决定通过教育高成和去教育全体社员。支部派人和高成和谈话的时候，高成和还没有认识到自己的错误，他说：“雇工是剥削，放债批青是剥削，拿钱买地还能算是剥削吗？”支部耐心地对他说：“老高，你说买地不是剥削。把买的地入到社里吃地租，地租是怎么来的？不是全体社员的劳动吗？”又对他说：“你有钱买光了贫困户的地，这不是要让这些穷兄弟们去给富农抗大活受剥削吗？”这句话打动了高成和的心，使他回想起过去自己没地没土，带着老婆孩子流浪到海城给地主抗大活，后来搬到保安村，在党的领导下走上了互助合作道路，才有了今天的生活，为什么我不按着党给我指的路走，偏偏要去发展新富农呢？最后，高成和坚决地向党表示：“从今以后，我一头扎在党的怀里，听党的话，再也不走弯弯路了。”在社员大会上，党支部批判社员买地的错误思想时，高成和也自动地作了检讨。社员们这才认识到：“差一点又走错了路。”大家一致同意支部的意见，从社的公积金里拿出两千五百斤豆饼和二百万元的现款，借给社外贫困户克服生产和生活上的困难。
    “社的生产发展了，社员的收入增加了，更要加强对社员的社会主义教育。”这是保安村支部最实际的体会。一九五三年的夏天，社里的庄稼长的茂茂腾腾，丰收就在眼前了。这时候，迟殿武潜伏了很久的退社思想又复活了。他暗暗地打着自己的小算盘：今年我全家能得四百个劳动日，每个劳动日按三万元计算，能分到一千二百万元，再抽出二百万元的股金，足能拴起一辆胶皮大车，那时候出社拉脚，来钱快，也免得在社里买不行，卖也不行，处处受限制。党员崔海和迟殿武住在一个屋里，他摸透了迟殿武的心思。崔海及时向党支部作了反映，支部认为，这绝不能当作个别问题去处理，因为在这以前便发现社员金泽珠、朴根太也产生了秋后退社的念头。如果不及时进行教育，这种思想会继续蔓延的。迟殿文是迟殿武的堂弟，于是党支部决定由迟殿文负责对迟殿武进行教育。有一天迟殿文遇见了迟殿武，便问他是不是打算出社，迟殿武不承认。后来支部书记韩恩，支部委员袁继芳等人，又相继找迟殿武去谈，迟殿武虽然口头上承认走合作化的道路是对的，但内心里总认为出社拉脚合算。支部发现迟殿武在平时最相信牛德芳的话，于是就叫牛德芳去劝他。牛德芳对迟殿武说：“过去我这旧脑筋，吃了不少亏，现在你怎么又想走回头路呢？”接着牛德芳又举出朱凤山因为拉脚和倒腾买卖破了产的例子。牛德芳的话，使迟殿武的退社的想法有些动摇了。但还没有完全死心。秋收季节到了，党支部大张旗鼓地在全村宣传总路线。“改造小农经济”，“走合作化的道路”，直往迟殿武耳朵里钻。迟殿武暗想：“保安村出了个劳动模范韩恩，才实行总路线，大概别的地方还不会实行总路线。”于是他一连写了八九封信，寄往住在吉林市、舒兰县等地的亲友们，问他们那里“是不是也有了总路线？”“是不是也要走合作化的道路？”不久，各地亲友陆续寄来了回信，都告诉他：“全国到处都实行总路线，都要走合作化的道路”，并劝他不要退社。这时候，迟殿武的儿子迟贵山经过党的教育，也认识了他父亲的错误，劝他父亲不要出社。迟殿武这才下决心不出社了，并说：“我要在保安村一直走到社会主义社会。”
    社员们最喜欢把社里的公共财产叫作“社会主义家底子”，大家都非常关心“社会主义家底子”的不断增长。现在社里的公共财产，已经扩大到了三亿多元，大大超过了社内私有财产部分。支部委员会常常教育社员们说：这就是我们向社会主义道路发展的保证。随着公共财产的不断扩大，支部始终没有忘记教育社员逐步降低社内非劳动报酬，为过渡到完全按劳取酬的高级农业生产合作社创造条件。一九五二年初建社的时候，支部对这个问题认识得还不十分清楚，社内非劳动报酬定的偏高；每垧土地的地租是一石二斗，股金利息是年利三分。这一年韩恩参观了苏联集体农庄后，才认识到农业社的非劳动报酬定的过高，就会影响社内社会主义因素的增长。韩恩回来和支部进行了研究，又请示了县委，决定在逐年增加社员收入的条件下，逐年降低土地等的报酬。第一年，土地报酬降低二斗，利息降低二厘。当时向农业社投资的人不多，经过宣传教育，并在韩恩、迟殿文以身作则的影响之下，支部降低非劳动报酬的提议获得了大家的同意。一九五三年，党支部在秋收分配前的一次会议上，决定争取将每垧地租再降低二斗，将利息再降低八厘。这年社员投资的多了，支部估计到这次降低利息将会引起一场尖锐的思想斗争。支部首先召集土地多投资大的社员进行座谈。第一个起来反对的就是梁乃堂，他气愤地说：“反正你们是想在我身上来开刀，我的一千多万元的投资我不要了，让大家分了吧。”座谈没有结果，支部决定用具体算账的办法去打通梁乃堂的思想。在第二次座谈会上，支部书记韩恩等人拨着算盘给梁乃堂看：你三垧六亩土地，一千一百五十万元股金，按降低二斗地租，八厘股息计算，你不过少收入一百二十万元，反过来再看，今年靠社员的劳动，新开了五垧水田，这五垧水田的收入，可以使每个劳动日多分七千块钱，你全家今年共作了四百个劳动日，便可以多分二百八十万元，两相比较，实际上你还增加一百六十万元的收入。梁乃堂还没有完全想通，韩恩又给他算开了第二笔账，由于全社降低了地租和利息，每个劳动日又可以多分两千五百元；你四百个劳动日，便可以多分一百万元。算到这里，梁乃堂笑了，他说：“我没有意见了。”其他社员也都算了一算账，虽然降低了非劳动的报酬，但大家的收入都比头年增加了。
    教育社员爱社要像爱家一样
    “大河里没水小河就干”这是韩恩农业生产合作社里的一句流行话。社员们把社比做大河，把自己比做小河，把个人和集体紧密地结合起来了。有一次，青年社员常守贵赶车到县粮库去送粮，正在卸粮的时候，有一个青年走过来，拿起鞭子，“啪，啪，啪”打了三声响鞭。常守贵放下肩上的粮袋，跑过去，说了声“同志，对不起！”便把鞭子夺了过来。那个青年感到很突然，说道：“真横，打几下鞭子就不行。”常守贵立刻对他解释说：“为了增产节约，我们队里开会规定了不许浪费一根鞭梢，你打这几下不要紧，好几百元浪费掉了。”
    支部副书记迟殿文同志，对社员思想意识上的这些变化体会得很深，他说：“真是人心大变了。”就以常守贵来说，现在是一个青年团员了，还因为他爱劳动，守纪律，受到了社管理委员会的奖励。可是，谁能想到在两年前他还是一个严重的自私自利分子呢。那时农业社刚刚建立起来，有一天来了一些参观的人，不小心，把常守贵家里的一只刚出蛋壳的小鸡踩死了。常守贵的老婆就闹翻了天，最后，社里只好赔了他一只小鸡。没过几天，常守贵赶车送粪的时候，故意把马的一只眼睛打坏了。当时他想：“死了，我才摊几个钱，反正是要不了脑袋。”
    党支部召开会议，分析了社员的思想情况。支部认为：社员中的自私自利思想是普遍和严重的，常守贵打坏马眼的事件，就是这种思想突出的表现。如果处理得好，可以教育全体社员，处理得不好，就会发生更严重的事件。当时群众也都反映：“若是就这样拉倒了，以后有人把马打死也没事了。”支部决定由迟殿文负责教育常守贵。起初，常守贵的态度还很强硬，他说：“我有钱，可以包赔。”迟殿文很严肃地批评了他这种错误态度，然后又很耐心地对他说：“守贵，你怎么不知道好好的进步呢！现在来数一数咱社里和你的岁数差不多的这些青年人吧，都进步的很快，还入了团，牛正才在生产中积极负责，事事跑到头里；牛桂芝是个十八岁的女孩子，在妇女中有很高的威信，韩玉崑、韩玉琛进步也都很快。再来看比你小的少年儿童们，他们哪一个不知道爱护公共财产。就是五六十岁的老头子们，也都积极劳动。你是怎么打算的？”常守贵是个爱强的人，本来他看到别人入了团，而自己还在团外，已经感到不安，现在迟殿文的话又恰恰刺到了他的痛处。他沉思了半晌，突然说：“好，我自己惹的乱子，我自己去收拾，以后我不进步，你再也别理我。”后来，他自动地到社员大会上作了检讨，请求社里扣他十个劳动日，赔偿社的损失。社员们对他的检讨表示满意。
    一九五三年，备耕时，社里决定发动社员进行普遍选种，并规定每选一百斤记一个劳动日。社员方老太太说：“我年纪大了，社里照顾照顾我，让我多挣几个劳动日。”便领去了三百斤豆种。五天以后，方老太太挑选的豆种完成了，不但选的干净，而且一斤一两都没有损耗。但是，不料往仓里一倒，暴露了秘密，原来她只挑选了三十斤盖在浮头，下面的根本没有挑选。方老太太的欺骗行为，引起了大家的不满，更引起了支部的注意。在这以前，就已经发现了社员崔玉山弟兄偷了社里的木头和粉面子，社员金铁山偷了社里的豆饼喂自家的猪，社员方中元碰坏了牛腿。支部认为，这些事情虽然都不大，如果不及时进行教育，发展下去就会严重起来。
    另一方面，社员中的集体主义思想和爱护公共财产的观念，也增长起来。共产党员杨成学，有一天赶着两匹马拉着一部锄草机下地，马突然惊跑起来，眼看锄草机就要碰伤马腿。在这个紧急关头，杨成学已来不及考虑自己的安全，便把缰绳缠到胳臂上，紧紧地坠在后边。马跑不动了，往后一退，杨成学倒了，一只马蹄子踩过来，杨成学的右脸上立刻出现了一道伤口，鲜血直流。这时候杨成学顾不得疼痛，一骨碌爬起来，把马赶回了马棚。他说：“把脑袋踩掉了，也不能撒手，碰坏两匹马就是六七百万元啊！”五天以后，大家又见他在地里作活了。
    党支部决定通过这两件事情，向社员进行一次集体主义教育。在社员大会上，首先表扬了杨成学爱护公共财产的模范事迹，得到了全体社员的热烈欢迎，大家提出了“学习杨成学”的口号。大会又批评了方老太太以及金铁山等人的自私自利行为。会后，又以各生产队为单位讨论这两件事情，并联系自己的思想进行检查。第三队队长于永兴检查自己看到某些社员的损害公共财产的行为时，总想，“得罪这人干啥，我才摊多大一点”，放任不管。他说：“我一定要改变这种错误的想法。”共产党员崔海，也检查出自己爱护公共财产的观念很差，他说：“有一次在试验新农具时，把扳子丢到地里了，也没有向社里报告，后来有人拾回来问我的时候，我还装不知道，不愿承认。”经过讨论，在社员中又发现了一些爱护公共财产的好社员。第一生产队副队长张世显，在讨论会上讲了一个故事：社成立以后，谁都不愿意去放牛，嫌麻烦，徐凤山便自动地担当起来。他每天赶着五十多条牛，早出晚归，风吹雨打，爬坡过岭，到处寻找草源。后来增加了七八只小牛，徐凤山日夜守护着，小牛在山坡上睡着了，他便拔一些青草盖在它们身上，小牛醒了，便打清水给它们喝，在他细心的照料下，牛群从来没有受过损失。有一天，一只母牛在山坡上吃草的时候，忽然生下了一只小牛，这里离村很远，喊人也喊不应，徐凤山便脱下自己的衣服把小牛包起来。张世显讲完了这个故事，接着检查了自己，他说：“我们队里最主要的财产就是牲畜，喂坏了一匹马，便损失二三百万元，可是我对饲养牲畜的工作，很少进行过检查，我对公共财产的爱护，和徐凤山比起来差远了。”他表示今后一定要加强自己的责任心。徐凤山爱护牲畜的故事，深深感动了将近六十岁的社员郜凤鸣，他宣誓样地对大家说：“你们看吧，我以后就要照着杨成学和徐凤山学习。我要把社当成我自己的家一样的爱它。”
    郜凤鸣的誓言，很快地就变成了行动。郜凤鸣家里存有二十多斤好线麻，这是他五年里一点一点积攒起来，预备娶了儿媳妇做鞋用的。过去曾有人向他借过，他从来没有答应。这时候，社的生产上急于需用线麻，买不到，便去问郜凤鸣能不能卖点线麻给社里。郜凤鸣笑了，他说：“我不是早就说过吗，我要把社当成自己的家——社里用就拿去吧。”郜凤鸣把麻从天花板上取下来，光用麻包片子就包了五六层，打开一看，真是又白又长的好线麻，整整二十六斤。社干部问他：“郜老爷子，你要多少钱一斤？”郜凤鸣说：“供销合作社的牌价是一万元一斤，我这个算八千吧，反正是自己地里出产的。”社干部一核计，像这样的好货色，在市面上一万五千元也买不到，决定给他按一万三千元作价，又向全社表扬了郜凤鸣舍己为公的模范行动。
    按照阶级政策来处理问题
    访问过保安村农业生产合作社的人，都会得到一个显明的印象：这里的党支部正确地执行了党在农业合作化运动中的阶级路线。关于这个问题，党支部副书记迟殿文同志说得很清楚，他说：“我们支部共有十九个党员，其中十八个是雇贫农出身，老韩和我都给地主抗过六七年大活，所以我们最容易理解依靠贫农（包括原为贫农的新中农在内）、巩固地团结中农，限制和逐步消灭富农经济这一阶级路线的意义。”党支部在领导土地改革斗争的时期，便注意培养贫农领导骨干，从而使互助组到农业社始终保持了贫农领导优势。同时，党支部也随时向轻视贫农和侵犯中农利益的思想和行为进行了斗争。
    农业生产合作社刚刚建立的时候，有三户老中农带着全套车马入了社。在讨论车马作价的时候，产生了侵犯中农利益的情绪，贫农社员刘德义主张压低中农社员的车马价格。好些贫农社员也赞成这个作法。这就引起了中农社员的不安。同时，中农社员牛德芳又提出了另一个意见：普遍抬高车马价格。牛德芳的意见，中农社员都同意，这又引起了无车户的不安。党支部发现以后，立即向全体社员进行了关于阶级政策的教育，指出只有贫农中农团结起来，才能和富农作斗争，并说明，压低中农的车马价格，是侵犯了中农社员的利益，普遍抬高车马价格，又会使贫农社员吃亏。这都是错误的作法，都会影响贫农中农的团结。社员们接受了党支部的意见，合理地处理了车马作价入社的问题。最后，选举了社干部，社主任和生产队长都由贫农社员担任，同时还选了两个中农社员担任生产副队长。建社以后，无论贫农或中农社员都非常满意，他们到处宣传说：“党的政策是正确的，入社一点也不吃亏。”
    建社不久，就发生了中农社员常守贵殴打贫农社员于和的事件。有一次轮到常守贵割草喂马，常守贵不去，饲养员于和批评了他。常守贵不接受批评，并说：“社里都是我的家底子，你一个光杆子入社，凭什么批评我。”他踢了于和一脚，又打了于和两拳，反说于和骂了他。于和气得病了五天，提出退社，他说：“不再受有钱社员的气了。”这件事发生以后，引起了社员思想上的波动，有的说：“这就是团结中农吗？中农打起贫农来了。”也有的说：“打就挨吧，上级叫团结中农哩。”党支部便在社员大会上，向大家说明：“农业社的财产是大家的财产，每个社员都有一份，贫农社员凭自己的劳动吃饭，并没有占别人的便宜。”同时也说明：“车马入社有本有利，车马吃的利息，是大家劳动的果实，如果光仗着有车马，而没有全体社员的劳动，是什么也搞不来的。”接着，韩恩代表社表扬了于和爱护公共财产的思想和行为，号召全体社员向于和学习。这时候，常守贵经过党支部事先的个别教育，又当场受到了社员们的批评，终于认识了自己的错误。常守贵接受党支部的劝告，除了在会上作了检讨以外，会后又亲自向于和道歉，于和也表示愿意和常守贵和好。后来他们果然成了很好的朋友，有一天于和病了，常守贵冒雨给于和赶车到新站街上去治病。人人见了都感动地说：“共产党真会教育人。”
    韩恩农业生产合作社在党支部的领导下，连年战胜了自然灾害的袭击，不断地扩大了生产，增加了社员收入，充分地显示了它的优越性。一九五三年底，有六十多户农民报名要求入社。这六十多户里边有一半是贫困户，他们不是地少人多，就是少车无马。党支部里有人不断地念叨：“咱们走了合作化的道路，生活都上升了，可是社外还有许多贫农没吃没喝，咱们可不能忘了穷哥们啊！”同时县委也不断地提醒他们；在扩大社的时候，要注意吸收贫困户。因此，支委会决定吸收贫困户入社。但是，在支部党员大会上，发生了分歧的意见。党员张宝金坚决反对吸收贫困户入社，他说：“要想把社办好，就不能吸收这些穷小子，他们两条腿支着一张嘴，进社就得管他们吃，非把社累垮不可。”支部委员张继生在支部会议上本来同意吸收贫困户入社了，现在也改变了意见，他说不吸收贫困户不好，吸收多了也怕支撑不住，因此他主张“十户里边吸收三户”。支部书记韩恩给他们解释说：“我们的生活好了，不能忘了穷弟兄。社扩大了，可以发展多种经济，不同的劳动力都会得到适当的安排，大家在不同的生产岗位上，共同为社创造财富，不但不会把社累垮，还会使社得到更大的发展。”他又解释：“我们社里已经有了很大一笔公积金，对十分贫困的社员，还可以用补助的办法。”韩恩提到了公积金，正触动了张宝金的思想本质。原来张宝金不是顾虑别的，就是怕新社员沾了社里公积金的光。他说：“好容易积攒了这么个家底子，让他们进来白享受，我不干；要不就把公积金分了，再重新积攒。”韩恩又给张宝金讲了许多道理，张宝金的思想还是不通。第二次支部大会又开到半夜，仍没有解决问题。第三次支部大会是由支部副书记迟殿文主持的。他首先提出问题：保安村的农民在同一天进行土地改革，在同一天翻身，现在为什么有的穷有的富？这些贫困户是从那里来的？保安村的共产党员应不应该负责？有没有责任去改变这种情况？支部书记韩恩首先带头作了检查。他说：“保安村共五个自然屯，党支部只在保安屯建立了一个农业生产合作社，把其余几个屯子的农民兄弟长期舍在社外，不教育不领导，听任他们在那卖牲口，卖土地，受富农的剥削，过困苦生活。这就怪不得那里的群众说：‘保安屯全国闻名，咱们屯是灯下黑’了。这实际上是对我们每个共产党员的批评。我们犯了错误，现在到了纠正的时候了。”党员崔海、袁继芳、张树坤等也都相继发言，他们一致认为，保安村还有这么多的贫困户，主要是因为党支部没有及早把他们引导到合作化的路上来。同时大家也都进行了自我批评，说自己只顾提高自己的生活，忘了穷弟兄们还在社外受苦。因此，他们主张把全保安村的农民兄弟都吸收到社里来。最后，只有张宝金一人还没有认识到自己的错误，他说：“支部过去没把工作作好，现在就想一把抓过来，这是急躁冒进情绪。”因此他主张一户一户地吸收，“慢慢来”。迟殿文突然向张宝金提出了一个问题：“宝金同志，你入党是为的什么呢？”张宝金毫不犹豫地回答：“为了解放受苦受难的穷兄弟们啊！”迟殿文接着问他：“那么现在吸收贫困户入社是为了什么呢？难道不是为了解放穷兄弟们吗？”迟殿文把张宝金问呆了。张宝金想：“对啊！”他还没来得及回答，这时候，张继生已经改变了自己过去的错误认识，也质问张宝金说：“宝金同志，穷兄弟们在社外饿的哇哇叫，你还‘慢慢来’，难道等饿死几口子再吸收他们入社吗？”这使张宝金回想起过去自己也是挨饿受冻的穷苦人，才翻身几天，就把穷兄弟们丢在一边不管。这时张宝金的思想通了，他在大家面前勇敢地承认了错误。
    党支部和社干部经过几天的个别交谈，到开社管理委员会的时候，主要的就剩了牛德芳和赵勤几个人还不同意吸收贫困户入社。牛德芳知道在党内已经批判了排斥贫困户的思想，所以他在管理委员会会议上也没有多讲，只说：“党既然要照顾这些贫困户，你们党员就先照顾他们吧，我反正不同意。”赵勤没有发言。这时候，韩恩、迟殿文、张继生、袁继芳等人，除了给牛德芳讲解一些关于贫农中农团结的道理以外，又帮助他算了一笔细账：从一九四七年成立互助组到一九五二年建社，二十五户在五年之中才积累了公积金八千万元；一九五三年社员增加到四十七户，在一年内，就积攒了公积金一亿六千万元，这些财富是那里来的呢？不是因为社扩大了，劳动力增加了，打的粮食多了，积攒的公积金也就多了吗？新老社员到底是谁沾了谁的光呢？很清楚。牛德芳听了，觉得满有道理，而且事实也正是如此，但是又不好意思马上承认错误，只好说：“我也讲不过你们，我同意就是了。”这时，赵勤在一边笑起来，他说：“你同意，我也同意了。”一九五二年入社的老社员同意了吸收贫困户，一九五三年入社的新社员当然更没意见了。当全体社员开会讨论接受新社员的时候，大家热烈地鼓掌欢迎六十多户新社员全部入社。大家说：“穷兄弟们不是生来就穷，欢迎他们入社，给他们挖穷根。”会场沸腾起来了，大家一起欢呼。
    在全国农村党的基层组织工作会议上，迟殿文告诉大家说：韩恩农业生产合作社就要过渡到高级农业生产合作社了。但是，保安村支部并不会满足现有的成绩。他们知道，今后的任务会更加艰巨；保安村农业生产合作社的社员们也不会满足目前的生活，他们懂得，未来的生活会比今天更美好。因此，最近他们制定了一个三年计划，要在三年以内将社员扩大到二百五十户，土地扩大到四百二十垧，粮食总产量可达三百四十多万斤。并饲养五十头菜牛，修建两个七千平方公尺的养鱼池，饲养几万条鲤鱼。在村内，建筑一座能容八百人的俱乐部，现在已经设计好了，几年内，还要陆续修建托儿所、卫生所、澡堂等设备，此外还准备架设电线，打谷碾米都将用电力推动，社员们的住宅，也将要全部安上电灯。目前，社员们正在党支部的领导下，为实现这个美好的计划，紧张地进行着劳动。
    〔注〕原保安村在去年八月和附近的二龙、仁和等几个村子合并为一个行政村，仍称保安村。原来各村的党组织也合并建立了总支部，原保安村支部改为分支部，分支部书记是韩恩、副书记是迟殿文。
