    Fujian Province Trial-Produces Deep-Ploughing Plow for Paddy Fields
    The Fujian Provincial Department of Agriculture's Farm Implement Experiment Plant has successfully trial-produced a deep-ploughing plow for paddy fields.
    This type of deep-ploughing plow for paddy fields was designed and improved based on local agricultural requirements, farming habits, and a comprehensive analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of old plows in Longxi, Longyan, Minhou, Changle and other places. After production, experiments were conducted in state-owned farms and some agricultural production cooperatives in Jianyang, Nanping, Longxi, Putian, Minhou, and other places. The experiments proved that this type of deep-ploughing plow for paddy fields can plow to a depth of three to six inches, and the pulling force is reduced by about 10 percent compared with the old plows. After this plow is promoted, it can solve the problem that ordinary old plows cannot deep-plough in paddy fields, which will play a certain role in increasing grain production.
    Recently, the plant has rushed to produce another batch of deep-ploughing plows for paddy fields and distributed them to farms in various parts of southern Fujian for further trial use, in order to prepare for future promotion.

    福建省试制水田深耕犁
    福建省农业厅农具试验厂，试制水田深耕犁成功。
    这种水田深耕犁，是根据当地农业耕作要求、耕作习惯并综合分析了龙溪、龙岩、闽侯、长乐等地旧犁的优缺点而加以改进设计的。制出以后，在建阳、南平、龙溪、莆田、闽侯等地国营农场和部分农业生产合作社进行了试验，证明这种水田深耕犁能耕深三寸至六寸，拉力比旧犁减轻百分之十左右。这种犁推广后，就可解决在水田一般旧犁不能深耕的问题，对粮食增产将起一定的作用。
    最近，该厂又赶制一批水田深耕犁，分发闽南各地农场再作试用，以为今后推广做好准备。
