    Dujiangyan Irrigation Area to Expand Irrigation Area by 800,000 Mu This Year
    The Dujiangyan irrigation area in western Sichuan, rich in natural resources, is undergoing canal and weir construction and renovation projects. Upon completion of the project, the irrigated area will be expanded by more than 800,000 mu this year.
    The Dujiangyan water conservancy project includes more than 260 canals and weirs, irrigating approximately 5 million mu of farmland in Chengdu, Wenjiang, Guanxian and other dozens of counties. After several renovations since liberation, the irrigated area has been successively increased by approximately 500,000 mu. Last winter, the Sichuan Provincial People's Government decided to extend the Guanchu Weir, which was built after liberation, by 31.4 kilometers; at the same time, it newly built a 37-kilometer-long West River water diversion canal, using the water of Dujiangyan to transform more than 800,000 mu of water-deficient land in the northern and southwestern edges of the irrigation area into two-season fields with gravity irrigation. On December 1, the two projects started construction simultaneously and will be completed by early March.
    In mid-December, 15,000 laborers from seven counties concerned were mobilized to start renovating the large and small main canals of the Outer River of Dujiangyan. It can be completed on January 20. The large and small projects in the nine counties of the Inner River basin of Dujiangyan have now begun surveying and will start renovation in late February, so as to supply farmland irrigation before Qingming Festival.
    In 1954, the grain output in the Dujiangyan irrigation area increased by more than 180 million jin compared with the bumper harvest in 1953, overfulfilling the production increase plan. It is estimated that the average yield of rice per mu in the benefited farmland can be increased by 45 jin after the currently under construction irrigation project is completed. From this year onwards, these fields can increase the country's rice production by more than 36 million jin every year. (Liu Yanbang)

    都江堰灌区今年将扩大灌溉面积八十万亩
    物产富饶的四川西部都江堰灌溉区域内，正在进行渠堰的修建和整修工程。工程完成后，今年将扩大灌溉面积八十万余亩。
    都江堰水利工程，包括二百六十多个渠堰，灌溉着成都、温江、灌县等十数县约五百万亩农田。解放后经过几次整修，已陆续增加灌溉面积约五十万亩。去年冬天，四川省人民政府，决定将解放后兴修的官渠堰延长三十一点四公里；同时新修一道长三十七公里的西河引水渠，利用都江堰的水，使灌区北部和西南部边缘上过去缺水的八十万余亩田地，改变成自流灌溉的两季田。十二月一日，两处工程同时全面施工，至三月初可全部完工。
    都江堰外江的大小干渠，十二月中旬，已动员有关七县民工一万五千人，分别开工整修。一月二十日可以完成。都江堰内江流域九县的大小工程，现已开始勘查，至二月下旬即将开工整修，以便在清明节前，放水供应农田灌溉。
    一九五四年都江堰灌区的粮食产量，已在一九五三年丰收的基础上增产一亿八千余万市斤，超额完成了增产计划。现正修建的增灌工程完成后，估计受益农田每亩可平均增产大米四十五斤。从今年起，这些田又可每年为国家增产大米三千六百多万斤。（刘彦邦）
