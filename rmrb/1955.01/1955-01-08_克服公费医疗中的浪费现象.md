    Overcoming Waste in Public Healthcare
    Yin Yi
    The implementation of the public healthcare preventative system has played a significant role in guaranteeing the health of state personnel and improving work efficiency. However, due to insufficient understanding of the significance of this system, some regions and state organs have experienced serious waste in the process of implementing this system, resulting in substantial overspending of public healthcare funds. For example, Tianjin exceeded its public healthcare budget by over 2.6 billion yuan in 1953. From January to September of last year, Dalian exceeded its budget by over 2.9 billion yuan. While some regions may not have experienced such severe overspending, or may not have overspent at all, the waste of medicine remains a serious issue.
    Waste in public healthcare work comes from two aspects: on the one hand, some medical personnel lack a sense of responsibility towards state property, wrongly believing that "the medicine belongs to the public anyway," "the state pays for whatever is used," or thinking that "cadets have many opinions and are difficult to satisfy." To avoid trouble, they disregard treatment principles, cater to patients, use a large amount of expensive medicines and nutritional supplements, or casually order fluoroscopies, lab tests, and X-rays, rarely focusing on actively improving the health of cadets and improving the hygiene of the organs. On the other hand, some state personnel lack basic medical and health knowledge, have an inadequate understanding of the significance of the state's implementation of the public healthcare preventative system, blindly trust medicine, and neglect physical exercise and daily hygiene, resulting in the phenomenon of wanting to take expensive medicine when sick and nutritional supplements when not sick. A few individuals possess serious privileged thinking, fail to comply with the medical system, use their authority to force medical personnel to violate treatment principles by using expensive medicines and nutritional supplements, or refuse the doctor's advice to be discharged when they should be.
    In order to improve public healthcare work and correct the waste in public healthcare, the leadership of health administrative departments and medical institutions must strengthen management, conduct in-depth inspections and research to improve the management methods of public healthcare, improve the system, and earnestly implement it. At the same time, ideological education on cherishing state property and adhering to treatment principles should be conducted among medical personnel, and they should go deeply into state organs in a focused and planned manner to understand the health status of these organs and conduct publicity on medical and health knowledge. As for the leadership of state institutions that enjoy public healthcare, they should also regularly pay attention to the implementation of the public healthcare preventative system in their own institutions, change their attitude of indifference, and assign dedicated personnel to manage this work, cooperate with medical departments to cultivate and train health workers. They should educate the staff of the organization, establish a sense of collectivism and cherish state property, and those who undermine the public healthcare preventative system and waste medicine and medical expenses should be criticized and educated. Only in this way can the waste in public healthcare preventative work be overcome, and the public healthcare preventative system can play a greater role.

    克服公费医疗中的浪费现象
    尹毅
    公费医疗预防制的实施，对保证国家工作人员的健康，提高工作效率，发挥了很大的作用。但是，由于对这一制度的意义认识不足，若干地区和国家机关在执行这一制度的过程中，发生了一些严重的浪费现象，公费医疗经费大量超支。例如天津市一九五三年度公费医疗经费超支了二十六亿余元；旅大市从去年一月到九月，超支了二十九亿余元，有些地区虽然超支现象并不如此严重，或者没有超支，但药品的浪费现象仍是严重的。
    公费医疗工作中的浪费现象来自两方面：一方面是部分医务人员缺乏对国家财产的责任感，错误地认为“反正药是公家的”，“用多用少有国家出钱”，或者认为“干部的意见多，难应付”，为了避免麻烦，不顾治疗原则，迁就病人，大量使用贵重药品，营养药品，或者随便开透视单、检验单、爱克斯光照像单等，而很少从积极方面去改进干部健康，改进机关卫生工作。另一方面，某些国家工作人员缺乏医药卫生常识，对国家实施公费医疗预防制的意义认识不足，盲目信赖药物，忽视体育锻炼和日常卫生工作，因而产生有病要吃贵重药，无病要吃滋补药的现象。少数人员则存在着严重的特权思想，不遵守医疗制度，利用职权，强迫医务人员违反治疗原则使用贵重药品和营养药品，或者本应出院，而拒绝医生出院的劝告。
    为了改进公费医疗工作，纠正公费医疗工作中的浪费现象，卫生行政部门和医疗机构的领导方面，必须加强管理，深入检查和研究改进公费医疗的管理办法，健全制度，认真执行。同时，应当对医务人员进行爱护国家财产、遵守治疗原则的思想教育，并有重点、有计划地深入到国家机关中去，了解这些机关的卫生状况，进行医药卫生知识的宣传。至于享受公费医疗的国家机构的领导方面，也应当经常注意本机关执行公费医疗预防制的情况，改变不闻不问的态度，并指派专人管理这项工作，配合医疗部门培养和训练保健员；应当对本机关工作人员进行教育，树立整体思想和爱护国家财产的观念，而对于破坏公费医疗预防制，浪费药品和医疗费用的人员，应给予批评和教育。只有这样，公费医疗预防工作中的浪费现象才能克服，公费医疗预防制才能发挥更大的作用。
