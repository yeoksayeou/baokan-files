(Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 12th) Sun De Sheng, Chairman of the National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front, delivered a report on the work and achievements of the Vietnam National United Front at the National Congress of the Vietnam National United Front on January 7th. The following is a summary of the report:

According to the charter of the Vietnam National United Front, the National Congress of the Vietnam National United Front should be held every three years. It has been more than three years since the Congress merged the Vietnam Independence League and the Vietnam National United Association into a single Vietnam National United Front in March 1951.

During the past three years, due to the increasingly intensified interference in Indochina by the American imperialists and the unwillingness of the French colonial aggressors to give up their aggression, fierce wars have been waged on our land and throughout Indochina. However, under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnam Workers' Party, and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and thanks to the tradition of unity and struggle of the Vietnam Independence League, the Vietnam National United Front has been able to unite the entire people, successfully carry out the war of resistance and national recovery, and achieve peace.

The purposes of this National Congress of the Vietnam National United Front are:

(1) To summarize the implementation of the policies of the Vietnam National United Front in the past three years;

(2) To recognize the new situation and the new tasks defined by President Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnam Workers' Party, endorsed by the National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front, and adopted by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam;

(3) To discuss the issue of consolidating and expanding the Vietnam National United Front in order to accomplish these new tasks in the current new situation.

The Vietnamese people hope to live a life of peace, freedom, and happiness, and hope to achieve complete independence. However, a handful of stubborn French colonialists are painstakingly implementing their policy of aggression against Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, and the American imperialists are also making every effort to interfere in Indochina, which forces the Vietnamese people to carry out a war of resistance and to closely unite with the people of Laos and Cambodia to fight against the common enemy. The purpose of our patriotic war is to achieve peace, independence, unity, democracy, freedom, and prosperity, and to contribute to the defense of lasting peace.

Since the Vietnamese People's Army launched a victorious offensive operation on the Vietnam-China border in 1950, the war of resistance has entered a stage of greater scale and more intense struggle. The program of the Vietnam National United Front has clearly stated that our war of resistance is a nationwide and all-people's long-term struggle; everything is for the front and for final victory; the war of resistance and national reconstruction should be carried out simultaneously.

In order to implement the program of the United Front, various political parties, people's organizations, and individuals in the United Front launched a patriotic emulation movement throughout the country—in mountainous areas and delta regions, in liberated areas and enemy-occupied areas.

The strong patriotic spirit of the Vietnamese people has been aroused. The people sent their beloved sons to join the regular army, local troops, guerrillas, and militia.

To support the battle, from 1951 to 1954, more than 1.5 million men and women participated in repairing bridges and roads and transporting grain and ammunition to the front.

On the battlefield, soldiers and combat support workers united closely to annihilate the enemy; in the rear, workers launched competitions to produce weapons for the front and various necessities for the people; farmers launched competitions to produce grain and pay agricultural taxes; industrialists and businessmen actively paid industrial and commercial taxes and contributed to the construction of the national economy; intellectuals and literary and art workers worked hard to serve the working people and soldiers. Men, women, old and young, students and children all enthusiastically and diligently completed their tasks.

The people responded to President Ho Chi Minh's call to launch the "Increase Production and Practice Thrift Movement," achieving good results. Therefore, despite natural disasters and enemy sabotage, the Vietnamese people were able to avoid famine. Due to increased production and thrift, the national economy and finance were established on a solid foundation and progressed, thereby guaranteeing the needs of the war of resistance and improving the living conditions of the people.

In order to increase production and enrich the strength of the war of resistance and restoration and reconstruction, President Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnam Workers' Party decided to implement rent reduction and land reform. This policy was enthusiastically approved and supported by all political parties, people's organizations, and individuals in the National United Front, as well as by people from all walks of life. To date, 610,104 farmers have benefited from rent reduction, and 78,000 farmers have been distributed 30,634 Vietnamese acres of land (one Vietnamese acre equals five Chinese acres), a large number of livestock, and grain. The implementation of the land policy has greatly encouraged the farmers—who account for 90 percent of the total population and the number of troops—to participate more actively in the patriotic war. The Vietnam National United Front has been further consolidated; the foundation of the National United Front—the worker-peasant alliance—has achieved favorable conditions for consolidation, and the people's political power in the countryside has also been strengthened.

The ethnic and religious policies stipulated in the program of the National United Front, based on the principles of equality among all nationalities and freedom of religious belief, have also been widely publicized and implemented. This policy has eliminated the discord created by imperialists and feudalists among various nationalities or religious groups, further strengthening the unity between various nationalities and religions.

While the people in the liberated areas were actively engaged in competitions in combat and national construction, the people in the enemy-occupied areas and guerrilla areas also demonstrated a firm and unyielding spirit. At the same time, Vietnamese overseas Chinese abroad have been strengthening their unity, always facing the motherland, President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnam Workers' Party, and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The unity of the people in the liberated areas, enemy-occupied areas, and at home and abroad has enabled the patriotic war to achieve victory.

This is also a decisive factor in helping the Vietnamese People's Army to achieve brilliant victories. In the past eight or nine years of the war of resistance, the Vietnamese People's Army annihilated a total of 466,172 enemy troops. In the Dien Bien Phu campaign alone, the Vietnamese People's Army annihilated 16,200 enemy troops and captured the entire enemy headquarters. In addition, the People's Army also seized a large number of weapons and ammunition supplied by the American interventionists to the French colonialists.

The close unity of the people and the victory of the Vietnamese People's Army have strengthened the power of the people. Under the leadership of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the people fought on one hand and carried out the work of restoring the economy and developing culture on the other.

The policy of national unity has not only achieved great success in various domestic activities but has also achieved great gains internationally. The Vietnamese people have consistently strengthened their friendship with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other people's democratic countries.

The unity between the Vietnamese people and the French people is also growing stronger, and the French people have played a major role in the struggle to stop hostilities in Indochina.

At the same time, the Vietnamese people have won the warm approval and support of peace-loving people all over the world.

In short, the Vietnamese people have achieved greater and greater victories and have received support from more and more friends, while the French colonial aggressors who follow the policy of American imperialists have suffered repeated defeats.

Under these circumstances, the Geneva Conference was convened to discuss the issue of restoring peace in Indochina. The French government had to recognize the sovereignty, independence, unity, democracy, and territorial integrity of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia; agreed to hold free general elections in these three countries in order to achieve national unity; and agreed to withdraw French troops from Indochina.

The restoration of peace in Indochina is a major victory for the people of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, as well as the French people and peace-loving people all over the world. Following the armistice in Korea, the restoration of peace in Indochina further eased international tensions. This once again proves that all international disputes, no matter how serious they are, can be resolved through peaceful negotiation.

President Ho Chi Minh, the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party, the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of Vietnam, and the National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front have called on all the people to correctly implement the Geneva Armistice Agreement.

Although the Vietnamese people and army have been strictly implementing the armistice agreement, the other side has not done so. In September 1954, the United States convened the Manila Conference, drawing in Britain, France, and several other countries into the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty." But this so-called "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" has been strongly opposed by major Southeast Asian countries.

The aggressive Southeast Asia Treaty provides conditions for the American imperialists to interfere in the internal affairs of Southeast Asian countries, plunder their resources, and turn their territories into American military bases. In addition, this treaty has included South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos within the area of the so-called Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, with the aim of establishing American war bases in these territories and undermining the future free general elections aimed at unifying Vietnam. The actions of the United States seriously violate the Geneva Armistice Agreement.

French colonial elements and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, who oppose the armistice, are carrying out shameless acts in violation of the Geneva Agreement according to American instructions. They destroyed public property in the areas they had to withdraw from, arrested residents, and savagely plundered the common people. They lured and forced northern residents to withdraw to South Vietnam, forced them to work on rubber plantations, or drove them into Ngo Dinh Diem's army. French Federal troops retaliated against people who had participated in the patriotic war in the regrouping areas of South Vietnam, closed more than a dozen newspapers in a short period of time, and arrested and detained peaceful people in the Saigon-Cholon area. They trampled on the democratic freedoms of the people. American interventionists also sent Collins to Saigon in order to directly realize American aggressive conspiracies.

In short, peace has been restored, but it has not yet been consolidated, unity has not yet been achieved, and independence and democracy have not yet been completed. The Vietnamese people still have to carry out a long and arduous struggle in peace.

Therefore, President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnam Workers' Party, and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have stipulated the common task for the Vietnamese people during this period: to consolidate peace, achieve unity, and complete national independence and democracy.

President Ho Chi Minh put forward new tasks for all the people in his New Year's greetings on New Year's Day, 1955.

All the people must resolutely follow President Ho Chi Minh's instructions. The main task of the Vietnam National United Front at present is to consolidate and expand national unity, in other words, to consolidate and expand the National United Front.

The Vietnamese people, who have united in the patriotic war and enabled this war to achieve victory, will unite more closely than ever before and will surely achieve final victory.

    越南国民联合战线的工作和成就
    ——孙德胜在越联战线全国代表大会上的报告摘要
    【新华社讯】据越南通讯社河内十二日讯：越南国民联合战线全国委员会主席孙德胜一月七日在越南国民联合战线全国代表大会上作了关于越南国民联合战线的工作和成就的报告，报告摘要如下：
    根据越南国民联合战线的章程，越南国民联合战线全国代表大会应该每三年举行一次。自从大会在一九五一年三月把越南独立同盟和越南国民联合会合并为一个单一的越南国民联合战线以来，已经有三年多了。
    在过去的三年多中间，由于美帝国主义者越来越加紧干涉印度支那和法国殖民侵略者不愿意放弃侵略，曾在我们国土上和整个印度支那进行了激烈的战争。但是在胡志明主席、越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府的领导之下，同时由于越南独立同盟的团结和斗争的传统，越南国民联合战线能够团结全体人民，胜利地进行了抗战和国家的恢复工作，并且取得了和平。
    越南国民联合战线这一届全国代表大会的目的是：
    （一）总结过去三年多中间越南国民联合战线政策的执行情况；
    （二）认识新的形势以及由胡志明主席和越南劳动党所规定、得到越南国民联合战线全国委员会的赞同并且为越南民主共和国政府所采纳的新的任务；
    （三）讨论关于巩固和扩大越南国民联合战线的问题，以便在目前新的形势下完成这些新的任务。
    越南人民希望过和平、自由和幸福的生活，希望获得完全的独立。但是一小撮顽固不化的法国殖民者却处心积虑地执行他们侵略越南、老挝和柬埔寨的政策，并且美帝国主义者也竭力对印度支那进行干涉，这就迫使越南人民不得不进行抗战，并且同老挝和柬埔寨人民紧密团结为反对共同的敌人而进行战斗。我们进行的爱国战争的目的在于实现和平、独立、统一、民主、自由和繁荣，并且对保卫持久和平作出贡献。
    自从越南人民军一九五零年在越南和中国边境发动了一次胜利的攻势作战以后，抗战就进入了一个规模更大和斗争更激烈的阶段。越南国民联合战线的政纲曾经明确地提出：我国的抗战是全国全民长期的斗争；一切为了前线和为了最后胜利；抗战和国家重建工作应该同时进行。
    为了执行联合战线的政纲，联合战线中的各个政党、人民团体和个人，在全国各地——山区和三角洲地区，解放区和敌占区——发动了一个爱国竞赛运动。
    越南人民强烈的爱国精神激发起来了。人民把他们心爱的儿子送去参加正规军、地方部队、游击队和民兵。
    为了支援战斗，从一九五一年到一九五四年，有一百五十多万男女参加了修桥补路的工作，把粮食和弹药运往前线。
    在战场上，战士们和战勤工作者紧密团结，歼灭敌人；在后方，工人们展开竞赛，为前线生产武器，为人民生产各种必需品；农民们展开竞赛，生产粮食，缴纳农业税；工商业家们积极缴纳工商业税，并为建设国家经济作出贡献；知识分子和文艺工作者努力工作，为劳动人民和军人服务。男女老幼、学生儿童都热情地努力地去完成他们的任务。
    人民响应胡志明主席的号召发动了“增产节约运动”，取得了良好的成绩。因此，尽管有自然灾害和敌人的破坏，越南人民还是能够避免饥荒。由于进行增产节约，国民经济和财政在稳固的基础上建立起来并得到了进展，从而保证了抗战供应的需要，改善了人民的生活条件。
    为了提高生产和充实抗战和恢复重建的力量，胡志明主席和越南劳动党决定贯彻减租和进行土地改革。这个政策受到了国民联合战线中各政党、人民团体和个人以及各阶层人民的热烈赞同和拥护。到目前为止，已有六十一万零一百零四名农民得到了减租的好处，七万八千名农民分到了三万零六百三十四越亩土地（一越亩等于五华亩）、大量的耕畜和谷物。土地政策的执行大大地鼓舞了农民——他们占全体人口和军队人数的百分之九十——更积极地参加爱国战争。越南国民联合战线更形巩固；国民联合战线的基础——工农联盟取得了巩固的有利条件，农村的人民政权也得到加强。
    国民联合战线纲领中根据各民族平等和信仰自由的原则所规定的民族和宗教的政策，也得到了广泛的宣传和执行。这个政策已消除了帝国主义者和封建主义者在各民族或各宗教团体之间所制造的不和，进一步加强了各民族和各宗教之间的团结。
    正当解放区人民在战斗和国家建设中积极地展开竞赛的时候，敌占区和游击区内的人民也表现了坚决不屈的高昂精神。同时在国外的越南侨胞也一直在加强他们的团结，一直向着祖国、向着胡志明主席、越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府。
    解放区、敌占区和国内外越南人民的同心同德，使爱国战争取得了胜利。
    这也是帮助越南人民军获得辉煌战果的一个决定性因素。在过去八九年的抗战中，越南人民军一共歼灭了敌军四十六万六千一百七十二人。单在奠边府战役中，越南人民军就歼灭了敌军一万六千二百人，俘获了整个敌军司令部。此外，人民军还缴获了美国干涉者供给法国殖民者的大量武器和弹药。
    人民的紧密团结和越南人民军的胜利加强了人民的力量。在越南民主共和国政府的领导下，人民一面战斗，一面进行了恢复经济和发展文化的工作。
    全国团结的政策不仅使国内各个活动部门取得了重大的成就，并且在国际上也取得很大的收获。越南人民始终不渝地在加强他们同苏联、中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家的友谊。
    越南人民和法国人民之间的团结也在日益加强，而且在争取停止印度支那敌对行动的斗争中，法国人民起了重大的作用。
    同时，越南人民也赢得了世界爱好和平的人民的热烈赞同和支持。
    总之，越南人民取得了越来越大的胜利，得到了越来越多的朋友的支持，而追随美帝国主义者政策的法国殖民主义侵略者，却接连遭到失败。
    在这种情况之下，日内瓦会议召开了，讨论了恢复印度支那和平的问题。法国政府不得不承认越南、老挝和柬埔寨的主权、独立、统一、民主和领土的完整；同意在这三个国家举行自由普选，以便实现国家的统一；同意把法国军队撤出印度支那。
    印度支那和平的恢复是越南、老挝和柬埔寨人民以及法国人民和世界爱好和平人民的一个重大的胜利。紧接着朝鲜的停战，印度支那和平的恢复进一步缓和了国际的紧张局势。这再度证明了，一切国际争端，不管它们是如何严重，都能够通过和平协商而得到解决。
    胡志明主席、越南劳动党中央、越南国民大会常务委员会和越南国民联合战线全国委员会已号召全体人民正确地履行日内瓦停战协定。
    虽然越南人民和军队一直在严格履行停战协定，但对方却没有这样做。一九五四年九月间，美国召开了马尼拉会议，把英国、法国和若干其他国家拉进了“东南亚集体防务条约”。但是这个所谓“东南亚集体防务条约”却遭到了东南亚的大国的强烈反对。
    侵略性的东南亚条约为美帝国主义者提供了条件，使他们可以干涉东南亚国家的内政，掠夺它们的资源并且把它们的领土变成美国的军事基地。此外，这个条约已经把南越、柬埔寨和老挝包括在所谓东南亚条约组织的地区之内，目的是在这些领土上建立美国的战争基地，破坏将来举行的、目的在于统一越南的自由普选。美国的行动严重地违反了日内瓦停战协定。
    反对停战的法国殖民分子和吴庭艳集团按照美国的指示，干下了违反日内瓦协定的无耻行为。他们在他们必须撤出的地区中破坏公共财产，逮捕居民和野蛮地掠夺老百姓。他们诱骗和逼迫北部居民撤往南越，强迫他们在橡胶种植园中作工或是把他们驱入吴庭艳的军队。法兰西联邦部队在南越的重新集结地区中，向曾经参加爱国战争的人们进行报复，在很短的时间内封闭了十多家报纸，并且逮捕和拘留西贡—堤岸地区的和平人士。他们蹂躏人民的民主自由。美国干涉者还派遣柯林斯到西贡，以便直接实现美国的侵略阴谋。
    总之，和平已经恢复了，但是还没有巩固，统一还没有实现，独立和民主还没有完成。越南人民仍然要在和平中进行长期而艰苦的斗争。
    因此，胡志明主席、越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府，已经给越南人民规定了在这个时期中的共同任务：巩固和平，实现统一，完成全国的独立和民主。
    胡志明主席在一九五五年元旦发表的新年贺词中提出了全体人民的新任务。
    全体人民必须坚决奉行胡志明主席的指示。越南国民联合战线目前的主要任务就是巩固和扩大全国的团结，换句话说，就是巩固和扩大国民联合战线。
    在爱国战争中已经团结一致而且使这个战争取得了胜利的越南人民，将比以往更加紧密地团结起来，并一定会取得最后胜利。
