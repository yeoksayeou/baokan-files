    Bald Mountains Grow into Lush Forests, Managing the Zhang River Water
    Bai Yuquan
    Yushe County in Shanxi Province is a mountainous area, with the Zhang River flowing through it. Many years ago, the county's hills and mountains were covered with shrubs and forests, pine and cypress trees filled the mountains, and the banks of the Zhang River were lined with lush willows. The area along the river was the main agricultural production area of Yushe County. However, during the long period before the War of Resistance Against Japan, especially during the War of Resistance, the forests of Yushe County were severely damaged by the Japanese invaders. Trees disappeared from the banks of the Zhang River, and the famous Black God Mountain and Shiyuan Mountain, once covered with pine forests, were destroyed and became bald hills. Forced by life, farmers cultivated the mountains in large numbers. Because the water source lost its soil and water conservation, mountain floods often broke out, and the floods rolled east and west, swallowing tens of thousands of acres of fertile land. By 1945, sixty percent of the more than 250,000 acres of the "granary" had been destroyed by floods. Farmers sadly said: "Opening up the mountains of Heshun, floating away the rice fields of Yushe."
    After the land reform, although the people in the mountainous areas also received land, the land was too barren due to the flood damage, and the grain harvested each year was still not enough to feed them. How to change the impoverished life in the mountainous areas? - This issue was discussed at the Yushe County Party Committee meeting. In order to solve this problem, the then County Magistrate Hou Yujie and some cadres also conducted in-depth investigations in the mountainous areas of Shiyuan, Huijiao, and villages along the Zhang River. A farmer from Hancun said to him: "County Magistrate, the Zhang River has washed away our good land! The river used to be so narrow that people on both sides of the river could talk to each other across the river; but look, now the river is four or five li wide!" The County Party Committee fully understood the demands of the masses and pointed out the correct path for the people of the county to get rid of disasters and poverty: "Plant trees and make forests, control rivers, fight against the Zhang River floods, and restore the land!" The vast number of farmers actively responded to the call of the Party and the government and planted 800,000 trees in 1945. Since then, the results of afforestation have been greater year by year. After 1949, the practice of planting trees only once before and after the Qingming Festival each year and sporadic tree planting by individual households was changed, and tree planting campaigns were launched in spring, rainy season, and autumn; "Mutual Aid Forests," "Cooperative Forests," "Youth Forests," "Militia Forests," "Children's Forests," and "Women's Forests" appeared one after another.
    Now, the county has 130,864 mu of newly planted and surviving trees, accounting for 28.6 percent of the county's 457,500 mu of suitable land for afforestation, and 62,000 mu of land has been closed off for forest cultivation; more than 20,810,000 surviving poplar, willow, walnut, and apple trees have been planted. The appearance of the mountainous areas with thick soil and thin soil has been changed. Large areas of young forests are everywhere along the Zhang River. The former barren hills and ridges are now covered with mountain peach, apricot, pine, cypress, and shrub forests. Vinegar willow and weeds cover the riverine forest land, playing a significant role in soil and water conservation: the river course is fixed, and the turbid water in the upper reaches of the Zhang River for forty li has become clear water. In the past, the river would dry up after a month without rain; in 1953, the Zhang River still flowed steadily after forty days without rain.

    秃山长茂林，管住漳河水
    白玉泉
    一山西省榆社县是个多山地区，境内有浊漳河流过。多少年前，全县大小山岭灌木丛丛，松柏满山，浊漳河两岸杨柳茂密，河水清澈。沿河一带是榆社县主要农产区。但是，在抗日战争前的漫长时代，特别是在抗日战争期间，榆社县的山林遭到了日寇的严重破坏，浊漳河两岸棵树不见，有名的、长满松林的黑神山、石源山被毁为秃岭，农民被生活所迫，大量垦山种田。由于河源失去水土保持，常有山洪暴发，洪水东滚西腾，吞没了成千上万亩的良田。到一九四五年，二十五万多亩的“米粮川”已被洪水冲坏了十分之六。农民们悲痛地说：“开了和顺山，漂了榆社米粮川。”
    土地改革后，山区人民虽然也分到了土地，但因洪水为害，土地过于瘠薄，每年收获的粮食仍不足糊口。怎样改变山区的贫困生活？——这个问题在中共榆社县委会议上进行了讨论。为了解决这个问题，当时的县长侯玉阶和一些干部也曾深入石源、辉教等山区和浊漳河沿岸的村庄进行了调查。韩村农民对他说：“县长，浊漳河水把俺们的好地都冲走啦！以前河可窄哩，俺们河两岸的人还可以隔着河说话呢；可是你看，现在这河总有四、五里宽呵！”县委充分了解到群众的要求，给全县人民指出了摆脱灾害和贫困的正确道路：“植树造林，管制河流，跟浊漳河洪水作斗争，恢复土地！”广大农民积极响应党和政府的号召，在一九四五年植树八十万棵。以后，造林的成绩一年比一年大。一九四九年以后，更改变了每年清明节前后植一次树和一家一户零星植树的做法，开展了春季、雨季、秋季的植树运动；“互助林”“合作林”“青年林”“民兵林”“儿童林”“妇女林”一片一片地出现了。
    现在，全县有新造的和成活了的林木十三万零八百六十四亩，占全县四十五万七千五百亩宜林地的百分之二十八点六，封山育林六万二千亩；已成活的杨树、柳树、核桃树、苹果树有二千零八十一万多棵。石厚土薄的山区的面貌改观了。浊漳河沿岸到处是大片幼林。从前的童山秃岭，已是满山遍野的山桃、山杏、松、柏和灌木林。醋柳和杂草覆盖着沿河林地，起了显著的水土保持作用：河道固定了，浊漳河上游四十里的浊水已变成清流。过去一月无雨，河水就枯干；一九五三年四十天无雨，浊漳河仍细水长流。全县沿河十七万亩河滩，因有树林的保护，有两万多亩已恢复为良田，年产粮食近四百万斤。
      “荒滩变粮川！”“荒山变宝山！”榆社县人民的这个美好的愿望开始实现了。人们亲手造的林正在带给他们越来越多的财源。全县的人造林现在已能供给群众盖房用的各种木材，从一九四九年以来，还向外地销售木材、木板四万九千多立方公尺，收入一百一十五亿七千多万元；销售桃仁、杏仁三亿零七千多万元。另外，还支援外地造林区各种树籽二万多斤，价值六亿多元。
    南村林业生产合作社经过几年来的造林育林，除沿河已恢复了一百多亩良田外，已造成的三十九万七千六百多棵杨柳树林，能当椽材用的已有一万多棵，预计七、八年后，可间伐檩柱木料四万多棵，约值十六亿元。每年冬天农民们可从林中割蒲草、砍醋柳六十五万多斤，至少可够全乡农户做三个月的烧柴。因此群众又把树林叫做“小煤窑”。二
    植树运动一年比一年开展得更广泛。大小山坡、沿河两岸的树越来越多。大林、小林、醋柳、灌木逐渐连成一片。可是新的问题也发生了：集体造的树林的所有权问题怎样解决呢？已经造成的树林怎样保护呢？毁林现象已开始发生：放羊的赶羊走进林内啃坏了树木，行人走路随便攀折树木，拾柴的到山坡上烘火取暖。树，栽的虽然不少，损伤的也不少。有的群众说：“树是公家的，公家就管起来；是咱们的，咱们大家管它；总得见个起落呀！”县委慎重地研究了群众的呼声，认为必须正确地贯彻“谁栽归谁，伙种伙有”的林业政策，依靠群众保山护林。一九五二年春天，各村便在党和政府的领导下，由群众选出公道的负责人，划定了林区，确定了林权。
    树木所有权明确规定了，人人关心树木的成长。县领导机关又召开了羊工、牛工座谈会，解决了牛羊牧场问题。各村在“靠山吃山，吃山养山”的口号下，发动群众保山护林；村和村之间，以及组、社，羊工、树主之间，共同订立了护林公约，人人负责，互相监督。白村、峡口、西马村等三村订立了交界地区互助管理的护林公约后，西马村群众看见有人刨白村小树林内的醋柳，便马上劝阻，并向白村林业社主任报告。白庄乡的滩林着了火，魏城乡支部书记带领本村群众跑去帮助灭火。发现毁林现象，群众自动地报告政府。这就改变了过去那种“群众造林，干部护林”的现象，保护了幼林的顺利成长。
      三
    植树和荒山播种是人人能干的活计，但是要做到“滴一籽出一苗”、“插一秧活一株”，并不是容易的。几年来，榆社县委为了保证树苗成活，加强林业干部的培养和对群众的技术指导，在每次植树造林前，总要集中全县林业委员、积极分子进行专门技术训练，交流经验。现在全县已有二百余个党员、干部能够掌握植树造林的技术。这些人分布在全县每个自然村，成为植树运动中的带头人和组织者。为了教给群众植树技术，在造林运动前，各乡、村都普遍召开植树能手、积极分子座谈会，交流经验，传授技术。南村在荒山播种时，在掌握技术的干部指导下，采用了男人刨屹洞，妇女、儿童滴种盖土的方法，效率高，质量好。
    由于始终贯彻了植树技术指导，广大群众普遍地掌握了“下削马蹄上切齐，树秧不能擦破皮”的植树方法，全县植树的成活率由一九五○年的百分之七十五左右提高到现在的百分之九十五以上。
    一九五○年以来，由于广泛地展开了集体造林和集体育林，南村、大寨、小杜余沟等村出现了不少林业生产合作社。但是因为各个造林单位的组织和人员经常变动，使得林木管理受到了影响：集体林里的老醋柳没人敢刨，小树枝混为一团没人修整。有的林已辨不出最初的界限。各个造林单位之间常常因砍醋柳闹纠纷。在基本合作化了的乡、村，农业、林业生产之间已发生了新的矛盾：社里要搞农业生产，原来造林的人又要刨醋柳、修树。社员们不去办集体林的事，怕没了自己的分；不到农业社干活，又怕少赚劳动日。为了解决这个矛盾，县委决定实行农、林业统一管理的办法，确定副社长、林业委员负责将现有的集体林内的树木、醋柳统一评产，以薪柴作为给原来造林单位的报酬，树木统由农业社经营。这样处理既不亏社，也不亏栽树的单位，并且丰富了社内生产的内容，增加了公共财产。社员们高兴地说：“小林变成大林，小单位变成大单位，只要社里连树林管起来，咱们就不怕顾了这头没那头了。”
