    Ministry of Agriculture and Other Departments Convene National Tea Conference
    To Determine Guidelines for Tea Production and Management
    [By Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives recently convened a National Tea Conference to discuss the development of tea production and tea procurement and sales. Based on needs and possibilities, the conference proposed guidelines and tasks for developing tea production in the coming years.
    The conference first studied the current state of tea production. China's total tea output in 1954 increased by more than 30 percent compared to 1950, and the quality also improved. Some abandoned tea gardens have been restored, and new tea gardens have been opened. Major tea-producing areas have adjusted and strengthened their original tea guidance organizations, and added nine experimental demonstration tea farms, 19 large-scale state-owned tea farms, and more than 150 tea guidance stations. More than 15,000 tea rolling machines have been promoted, and 48 state-owned tea processing factories have been established, gradually standardizing the processing of export tea. The socialist elements in the tea industry are also growing year by year. The majority of tea farmers engaged in mutual aid and cooperation have reached 30 percent in most tea areas, and 90 percent in some areas. In 1954, state-owned enterprises and cooperatives purchased more than 98 percent of the tea on the market, and the state has taken complete control of exports and domestic wholesale. The export volume of tea has also increased year by year. In the past five years, the steel materials exchanged for exported tea could lay six railways from Beijing to Shanghai or purchase 20,000 tractors. The supply of tea to ethnic minorities has increased by 132 percent compared to 1950. However, the conference further pointed out that China's tea production and export volume have not yet reached pre-war levels and are far from meeting the requirements of domestic and foreign markets.
    The conference determined the guidelines for future tea production and management: take the development of mutual aid and cooperation as the center, vigorously develop tea production, actively consolidate existing tea gardens, and increase yield per unit area; rapidly reclaim abandoned tea gardens, and plan to open up new tea gardens in mountainous and hilly areas to expand the tea garden area; continuously improve production technology and improve tea quality; guarantee complete procurement and correctly implement price policies; improve business management, actively expand foreign sales under the principle of domestic sales serving foreign sales, and plan to guarantee sales to border regions and appropriately arrange domestic sales. Continue to carry out the socialist transformation of private tea merchants. Based on these guidelines, the conference proposed production tasks: tea production in 1955 should increase by more than 9 percent compared to 1954, and increase by more than 40 percent in 1957, and exceed pre-war levels before 1962. To this end, the conference believes that all localities must strengthen leadership over tea production. Tea-producing areas should regard tea production as an important component of the agricultural production plan and carry out specific arrangements and leadership. In the next few years, it is necessary to actively consolidate existing tea gardens and increase yield per unit area. In addition, in the next three years, all reclaimable abandoned tea gardens must be reclaimed, and new tea gardens must be planned in mountainous and hilly areas to expand the tea garden area and complete production requirements.
    The conference also specifically discussed issues such as land use rights, taxation, prices, procurement, and technical and economic assistance to tea farmers in tea production.

    农业部等部门召开全国茶叶专业会议
    确定茶叶生产和经营的方针
    【本报讯】农业部、对外贸易部、全国合作总社在最近召开了全国茶叶专业会议，讨论了发展茶叶生产和茶叶购销问题；并根据需要和可能，提出了最近数年发展茶叶生产的方针和任务。
    会议首先对目前茶叶生产的情况作了研究。我国茶叶总产量，一九五四年比一九五○年提高百分之三十多，品质也有所提高，部分荒芜茶园已经恢复，并开辟了新茶园。主要茶区调整充实了原有茶叶指导机构，并增设了实验示范茶场九所，大型国营茶场十九所，茶叶指导站一百五十多所，推广揉茶机一万五千多架，建立国营加工茶厂四十八所，使出口茶叶的加工逐渐正规化。茶叶事业的社会主义因素也在逐年增长，进行互助合作生产的茶农大部分茶区已达到百分之三十，个别地区已达到百分之九十。一九五四年国营企业和合作社收购的茶叶已达上市量百分之九十八多，出口和国内批发已全部由国家掌握。茶叶的出口数量也在逐年增加，五年来出口茶叶换回的钢材，可以铺设从北京到上海的铁路六条，或拖拉机两万部。供应少数民族的茶叶较一九五○年增长百分之一百三十二。但会议进一步指出，我国茶叶生产和出口数量还没有达到战前水平，也远不能满足国内外市场的要求。
    会议确定了今后茶叶生产和经营的方针：以开展互助合作为中心，大力发展茶叶生产，积极整理现有茶园，提高单位面积产量；迅速垦复荒芜茶园，有计划地大量在山区丘陵地带开辟新茶园，扩大茶园面积；不断改进产制技术，提高茶叶质量；保证全部收购，正确贯彻价格政策；改善经营管理，在内销服从外销的原则下，积极扩大外销，有计划地保证边销，适当安排内销。继续进行私营茶商的社会主义改造。会议根据这一方针，提出生产任务：一九五五年的茶叶生产应比一九五四年提高百分之九多，一九五七年要提高百分之四十多，在一九六二年以前要超过战前水平。为此，会议认为，各地必须加强对茶叶生产的领导，茶叶产区应把茶叶生产作为农业生产计划的重要组成部分，进行具体的布置和领导。在最近几年内必须积极整理现有茶园，提高单位面积产量。此外，在最近三年内必须全部垦复一切能垦复的荒芜茶园，并有计划地在山区丘陵地带开辟新茶园，以扩大茶园面积，完成生产要求。
    会议并具体讨论了茶叶生产中土地使用权、税收、价格、收购以及对茶农进行技术、经济扶助等问题。
