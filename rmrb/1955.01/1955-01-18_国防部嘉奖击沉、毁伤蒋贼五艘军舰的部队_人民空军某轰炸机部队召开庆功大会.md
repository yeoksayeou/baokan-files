    Xinhua News Agency, 17th: The Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China issued a commendation order, commending the air and naval units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Zhejiang Front for achieving a major victory on January 10th, destroying, sinking, and damaging five Chiang Kai-shek warships. The commendation order calls on all participating units to carefully summarize their experiences, avoid arrogance and impetuosity, and continuously improve their techniques and tactics in order to strive for greater victories.
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Front, 17th: An air force bomber unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Zhejiang Front held a victory celebration on the 16th to commend personnel who had established meritorious service in the battle to destroy and damage Chiang Kai-shek warships on the 10th and in other battles.
    Two-fifths of the personnel in this air force unit have been gloriously credited for their heroic fighting and diligent work. During the battle to bomb Chiang Kai-shek's warships in the port of Dachen Island on the 10th, pilot Liu Jianhan braved strong winds and fiercely carried out dive bombing on Chiang Kai-shek's warships, damaging a large logistics ship of Chiang Kai-shek's navy. During the battle, he also took the initiative to suppress Chiang Kai-shek's ground fire with attacks, covering and ensuring the safety of the lead plane. Therefore, he was approved for a first-class merit citation and received a certificate from the Chinese New Democratic Youth League organization. Wang Yufeng, the lead pilot of a certain squadron, actively led everyone in studying tactics and achieved great results in leading the squadron in bombing Chiang Kai-shek's troops and warships. Armorer Zou Delian was able to carefully study and summarize experience, create and promote new work methods, and actively help others, greatly improving the efficiency of ordnance work and shortening the preparation time for aircraft sorties. Yang Yihong, the lubricating oil truck driver, ensured safe driving for thirty-seven months and paid attention to maintaining the parts, extending the service life of the truck by thirteen months. Therefore, they were all gloriously awarded second-class merit citations. In addition, flying squadrons, aircraft maintenance teams, repair vehicles, and other units have been awarded collective merit citations.
    At the celebration meeting, the heroes were rewarded and commended. Unit leaders and representatives of higher-level leaders called on the heroes and all personnel at the meeting to continue to intensify their efforts to improve their command and bombing skills, strengthen various tasks, and strive for greater victories in the battle to liberate Taiwan and coastal islands!

    在庆功会上，功臣们都受到了奖励和表扬。部队首长和上级首长的代表，在会上号召功臣和全体人员继续加紧提高指挥和轰炸的本领，加强各种工作，争取在解放台湾和沿海岛屿的战斗中得到更大的胜利！
