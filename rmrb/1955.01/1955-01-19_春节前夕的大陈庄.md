Da Chen Village in Ninghe County, Hebei Province, on the eve of the Spring Festival: The courtyards of every household are swept clean, many farmers have already changed into new clothes for the festival, and the New Year's goods for each family are almost ready. These past few nights, a small theatrical troupe in the village has been rehearsing two short programs, "Laboring Couple" and "Don't Take the Wrong Path," under electric lights. These days, the radios in each household are often turned on, listening to songs broadcast by radio stations in Beijing, Tianjin, and other places. The children are even happier, running around in the village, especially when they hear that someone's radio is on, or the theatrical troupe is rehearsing, or the cooperative has bought New Year's goods, or someone is preparing to get married; they make even more of a commotion. There are five weddings in the village before the Spring Festival. Happy farmers are circulating a couplet by word of mouth: "In the past, when the Spring Festival arrived, landlords came to press for debts, and every family was worried; now, when the Spring Festival arrives, every family has surplus money, and everyone is happy."

Recently, the Da Chen Village Agricultural Production Cooperative has also set a plan to increase grain production by 185,000 jin this year compared to last year. Combining the habit of cleaning up before the Spring Festival, the members have launched a fertilizer accumulation campaign. Yang Zhaoqing, the director of the cooperative, said: "We will never forget production during the Spring Festival. This year, we will produce more grain to support the country's industrial construction." (Xinhua News Agency)

    春节前夕的大陈庄
    春节前夕的河北省宁河县大陈庄，各家各户的院落都打扫得干干净净，许多农民已经换上了节日的新装，每家的年货也都快准备好了。这几天晚上，村里的一个小型剧团，正在电灯光下赶排着“劳动夫妻”“别走错路”两个短小的节目。各家的收音机这几天也经常开着，收听着北京、天津等广播电台播送的歌曲。孩子们更显得高兴，在村子里跑来跑去，特别是听到谁家收音机开了，或者剧团排戏了，合作社买来年货了，谁家筹备结婚，他们就闹得更欢。春节前全村有五家结婚的。喜气洋洋的农民口头上流传着一付对联：“过去春节到，地主来逼债，家家发愁；现在春节到，家家有余钱，皆大欢喜。”
    最近，大陈庄农业生产合作社还订出了今年要比去年增产十八万五千斤粮食的计划。社员们结合春节前大扫除的习惯，都展开了积肥活动。合作社主任杨兆庆说：“我们过春节也决不忘生产，今年我们要打更多的粮食，来支援国家工业建设。”　（新华社）
