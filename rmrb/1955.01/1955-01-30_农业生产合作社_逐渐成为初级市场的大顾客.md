Agricultural Production Cooperatives
　　Gradually Become Major Customers in Primary Markets
　　The recent trading situation in Pengzhen, a primary market in Shuangliu County, Sichuan Province, shows that agricultural production cooperatives have gradually become the largest customers in primary markets. In 1952, the Pengzhen Supply and Marketing Cooperative bought a new-style walking plow for trial sales, but it sat for more than a year without being purchased. Last autumn, after the agricultural cooperation movement was launched around Pengzhen, the Pengzhen Supply and Marketing Cooperative sold seven new-style walking plows in December of last year. In the villages near Pengzhen, after each agricultural production cooperative was established, it immediately signed a combination contract with the Pengzhen Supply and Marketing Cooperative, requesting the Supply and Marketing Cooperative to supply new-style agricultural tools, chemical fertilizers, phosphate fertilizers, draft cattle, and seeds, and to purchase and sell agricultural by-products. In the contracts signed by the Pengzhen Supply and Marketing Cooperative and 25 agricultural production cooperatives in Pengzhen, Ganzi, Hongshi, and other townships, the amount of production materials supplied this year reached 440 million yuan. In the pig and cattle trading markets, procurement personnel from agricultural production cooperatives often come to purchase pigs and cattle in batches, and some bring old and young cattle to exchange for strong cattle. More than ten agricultural production cooperatives newly built in Pengzhen Township after last autumn had purchased more than 220 pigs and purchased and exchanged 37 draft cattle by mid-January of this year. On the deposit ledgers of the two credit cooperatives in the town, the largest accounts also belong to agricultural production cooperatives. Four agricultural production cooperatives in Ganzi Township deposited more than 40 million yuan in the credit cooperatives, and recently they have withdrawn more than 30 million yuan for production. Members of agricultural production cooperatives also purchase more daily-use industrial products than ordinary farmers. (Xinhua News Agency)

    农业生产合作社
    逐渐成为初级市场的大顾客
    四川省双流县的一个初级市场——彭镇，最近的交易情况表明：农业生产合作社已逐渐成为初级市场上最大的顾客。一九五二年，彭镇供销合作社曾买回一部新式步犁试销，但放了一年多没人买。去年秋季，彭镇周围农业合作化运动开展后，彭镇供销合作社在去年十二月份就销售了七部新式步犁。在彭镇附近的乡村里，每个农业生产合作社建成后，都立即和彭镇的供销合作社订立结合合同，要求供销合作社供应新式农具、化学肥料、磷肥、耕牛和种籽，收购和推销农业副产品。彭镇供销合作社和彭镇、柑梓、红石等乡的二十五个农业生产合作社所订的合同中，今年供应生产资料的金额达四亿四千多万元。在猪、牛等交易市场上，农业生产合作社的采购人员经常成批的前来购买猪、牛，有的把老牛小牛牵来调换壮牛。彭镇乡去年秋后新建的十多个农业生产合作社，到今年一月中旬已买进二百二十多头猪，买进和调换了三十七头耕牛。在镇上的两个信用合作社的存款帐簿上，最大的户头也是农业生产合作社。柑梓乡四个农业生产合作社在信用合作社存了四千多万元，最近他们已取出三千多万元投入生产。农业生产合作社社员购买日用工业品也比一般农民为多。　（新华社）
