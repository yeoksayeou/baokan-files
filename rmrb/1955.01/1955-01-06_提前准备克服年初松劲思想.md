The workers of the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant are striving to overfulfill the state plan in all aspects, starting from the first month of this year.

The leadership of the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant promptly discovered the slack mood of some cadres and workers. For example, some workers said, "We have been busy all year, we should stay longer for a couple of days during the Spring Festival." The plant leadership extensively carried out political education work, calling on all employees to guarantee the comprehensive overfulfillment of the production tasks for the first quarter of 1955 to support the struggle to liberate Taiwan.

In order to effectively overcome the slack mood, in addition to making production and technical preparations for the first quarter of 1955 in advance, so that more than 20 new products were put into production in December 1954, the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant also released the production targets for January 1955 to the workshops in advance on December 21 and 22, 1954, and mobilized all employees to discuss the national plan for January 1955 from December 26 to 29. The workers of the lathe team in the metalworking workshop compressed the task that required 1,600 hours to complete into 824 hours; the workers of the lathe team two compressed the task that required 5,067 hours to complete into 3,803 hours. The method was to learn from advanced Soviet experience and use new lathe tools such as Unanov and Kolesov to solve the difficulties of having many tasks and insufficient machine time. Many groups of workers put forward measures to ensure the completion of the production plan, and decided to launch a labor competition between groups and workshops starting in January 1955.

    提前准备克服年初松劲思想
    沈阳重型机器厂职工争取从今年第一个月起，就全面超额地完成国家计划。
    沈阳重型机器厂领导上及时发现了某些干部和工人的松劲情绪，如有的工人说：“忙一年了，过春节时说什么也得多呆两天。”厂领导上广泛地进行了政治教育工作，号召全体职工用保证全面超额地完成一九五五年第一季度的生产任务，支援解放台湾的斗争。
    为有效地克服松劲情绪，沈阳重型机器厂除提前做好了一九五五年第一季度的生产技术准备，使二十多种新产品在一九五四年十二月份就已投入了生产外，并提前在一九五四年十二月二十一、二日，把一九五五年一月份的生产指标下达到车间，并从十二月二十六日到二十九日，发动全体职工讨论一九五五年一月份国家计划。金工车间车工一组的工人们，把需要一千六百小时才能完成的任务，压缩到八百二十四小时；车工二组的工人们把需要五千零六十七小时才能完成的任务，压缩到三千八百零三小时，方法是学习苏联先进经验、采用乌纳诺夫、科列索夫等新式车刀，解决任务多、台时不足的困难。许多小组工人提出了保证完成生产计划的措施，决定从一九五五年一月份就展开组与组、车间与车间的劳动竞赛。
