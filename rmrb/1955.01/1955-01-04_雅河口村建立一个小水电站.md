    A Small Hydropower Station Established in Yahekou Village

    With the help of the government, Yahekou Village in the Second District of Huanren County, Liaoning Province, has established a small hydropower station. Currently, the electricity provided by this small hydropower station not only supplies lighting for the district office, health clinic, supply and marketing cooperative, elementary school, and more than two hundred households in Yahekou Village, but has also begun to assist farmers with threshing and rice milling. One electrically powered rice thresher can thresh 22,000 jin of rice grain per day with eight people, which is four times more efficient than the foot-operated rice threshers used by farmers in the past. In 1953, the farmers in this village used internal combustion engines (burning charcoal) to drive two 10-horsepower rice milling machines, which could mill 12,500 jin of rice per day and night. Now, they use electricity to drive the same two rice milling machines, which can mill 20,000 jin of rice per day and night, not only improving the rice milling efficiency, but also saving 400 jin of charcoal and more than 4 jin of glycerin per day and night.

    This small hydropower station has greatly promoted the development of mutual aid and cooperation. The number of farming households joining cooperatives has now increased from 79 before the station was built to 178. (Xie Zongyi, Xu Cai)

    雅河口村建立一个小水电站
    辽宁省桓仁县二区雅河口村由政府帮助建立了一个小型水力发电站。现在，这个小型水力发电站送的电除供给在雅河口村的区公所、卫生所、供销合作社、小学校和二百多户居民照明外，并开始帮助农民脱谷和碾米。用电力带动的一台打稻机，每天八个人脱稻谷两万二千斤，比过去农民用脚踩打稻机提高效率四倍。一九五三年，这个村的农民利用内燃机（烧木炭）带动十马力的碾米机两台，一昼夜可碾稻米一万二千五百斤；现在，他们利用电力带动同样的两台碾米机，一昼夜碾稻米两万斤，不仅提高了碾米效率，每昼夜还节省木炭四百斤、甘油四斤多。
    这个小型水力发电站大大促进了互助合作的发展。现在入社农户已由建站前的七十九户增加到一百七十八户。　（谢宗义　徐才）
