[Report from this newspaper] Many factory, mine, and basic construction site workers in various regions have vowed to guarantee attendance during the Spring Festival and strive to complete and overfulfill the January national plan.

    Workers at many factories, including the state-owned Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, are carrying out an "all-attendance competition." Workers in the standard parts workshop, quenching workshop, and accounting and sales departments of the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant have pledged to guarantee attendance during the Spring Festival and strive to complete the January plan ahead of schedule. The Lian Tongyi team in the large parts workshop has proposed to win the glorious title of "all-attendance team." Labor model Sheng Li has completed more than one month and two days' worth of production quota in the twelve and a half actual working days from the start of production to January 16th. Workers in many light industry factories in Shanghai have included conditions for improving product quality in their attendance guarantees. The Mao Shunyao team of the steel rolling section of the Shanghai No. 2 Steel Plant has set out seven specific guarantees, including exceeding output, improving quality, and ensuring 100% attendance in January. Workers in the section of the steel bar forming plant where the famous labor model Huang Demao of Anshan Iron and Steel Company is located have issued a letter of guarantee to all workers in Anshan, promising not to be absent from work or ask for leave during the Spring Festival, and to complete the January task seven days ahead of schedule and the first quarter task fifteen days ahead of schedule. Workers in the East Distillation Workshop of the Northeast Petroleum No. 1 Plant responded to the call from the leadership to "produce well, be safe, and have good attendance during the New Year and Spring Festival," overfulfilling the operational plan for the first ten days of January by 1.8% and achieving an attendance rate of 100%. Six advanced producers in industry and transportation in Harbin, Li Mingshun, Xie Guichen, Chen Huanzhi, Zhang Shourong, Wang Huanfeng, and Wu Shutang, also recently jointly wrote to all workers in the city, proposing to guarantee no slackening and full attendance during the Spring Festival. They also pledged not to drink excessively during the Spring Festival, to pay attention to conservation, to abide by operating procedures during production, to pay attention to machine maintenance, and to ensure no accidents. Workers in twenty production sections of the state-owned Tianjin Bicycle Factory have also put forward specific guarantees for normal attendance, safe production, and guaranteed quality during the Spring Festival. The broad masses of workers at the state-owned Ma'anshan Iron Plant warmly responded to the call of the Party committee to further strengthen unity during the Spring Festival, overcome various difficulties brought about by rain and snow, strengthen the equipment maintenance of the iron-smelting furnace, and ensure the smooth completion of the iron-smelting task. The workers of the Third Engineering Section, which is constructing the Qinling Tunnel in the Baoji-Chengdu Railway's Baolue North Section, unanimously stated that they would resolutely break through the Qinling Mountains before returning home. The Wang Tianxiang model team at the northern entrance of the Qinling Tunnel has set a plan to achieve a 100% attendance rate during the Spring Festival and challenged all workers in the section.

    Many workers who originally planned to take leave to go home for the Spring Festival have decided not to go home after realizing that this year is a year of decisive significance for completing the national Five-Year Plan, and that failure to complete production and construction tasks on time will delay the speed of national industrialization. Zhan Shunlai, the tool administrator of the Mechanical and Electrical Section of the state-owned Ma'anshan Iron Plant, had not returned home for ten years and had long planned to take leave during the Spring Festival to visit his parents. However, when he thought that iron-smelting was a continuous production process, he decided not to take leave to go home to avoid affecting production. Peng Bangqi, a worker in the excavation team at the northern entrance of the Qinling Tunnel, was originally scheduled to go home for his wedding. His father had recently sent him three letters urging him to return home, but after considering that the Qinling Tunnel was a key project of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, he decided to postpone his wedding.

    The family members of workers in various factories have also vowed to ensure that their husbands or children attend work as usual during the Spring Festival. The family committee of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's steelmaking plant has made a public agreement to ensure that their husbands or children get good rest, eat well, and attend work as usual during the Spring Festival. Some family members are also preparing to invite single workers or workers who live far from home to celebrate the Spring Festival together. More than 800 worker representatives and family members of the Wuchang No. 1 Cotton Mill held a joint celebration, mutually making guarantees regarding attendance during the Spring Festival. Workers returning to their hometowns have stated that they will definitely return to the factory on time and strive to do a good job in publicizing the worker-peasant alliance, mobilizing their parents and relatives to participate in mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, and sell surplus grain to the state.

    许多厂矿和建设工地的职工纷纷提出保证
    春节前后不缺勤努力完成计划
    【本报讯】各地许多厂矿和基本建设工地职工，纷纷保证春节前后不缺勤，争取完成和超额完成一月份国家计划。
    国营上海机床厂等许多工厂的职工正在开展“全勤竞赛”。上海机床厂标准件车间、淬火车间和会计、供销等科室的职工，已提出了春节前后不缺勤，并争取提前完成一月份计划的保证。大件车间连桐益小组提出要夺取“全勤小组”的光荣称号。劳动模范盛利从开年生产到一月十六日的十二天半的实际工作日中，已完成了一个月零两天多的生产定额。上海许多轻工业工厂的工人在不缺勤的保证中都订有提高产品质量的条件。上海市钢铁二厂轧钢工段毛顺耀小组订出超额产量、提高质量和保证一月份做到百分之百地出勤等七项具体保证。鞍山钢铁公司著名劳动模范黄德茂所在的钢筋成型厂一段的工人，向全鞍山市职工提出了春节前后不旷工不请假，并且提前七天完成一月份任务，提前十五天完成第一季度任务的保证书。东北石油一厂东蒸馏车间的职工响应领导方面提出的“新年春节期间生产好、安全好、出勤好”的号召，超额百分之一点八完成了一月份上旬的作业计划，出勤率达到百分之一百。哈尔滨市工业、交通运输业先进生产者李明顺、谢贵臣、陈焕芝、张守荣、王缓凤、吴树棠等六人，也在最近联名写信给全市职工，提出春节前后保证不松劲，出满勤。春节期间不酗酒，注意节约，生产时遵守操作规程，注意机器保养，保证不出事故。国营天津自行车厂二十个生产工段的职工也提出在春节前后正常出勤，安全生产、保证质量的具体保证条件。国营马鞍山铁厂广大职工热烈响应党委号召，在春节期间进一步加强团结，克服雨雪带来的各种困难，加强炼铁炉的设备维护工作，保证炼铁任务的顺利完成。修建宝成铁路宝略北段开挖秦岭隧道的第三工程段的工人们，一致表示要坚决打通秦岭以后再回家。秦岭隧道北口的王天祥模范小组，订出春节前后出勤率达到百分之百的计划向全段工人挑战。
    原来打算请假回家过春节的许多职工，由于认识到今年是完成国家五年计划具有决定意义的一年，如果不按时完成生产和建设任务，就要延缓国家工业化的速度，都决定不回家了。国营马鞍山铁厂机动科工具管理员詹顺来十年没有回家，很早就准备在春节请假回家探望父母，当他想到炼铁是连续性的生产时，就决定不请假回家，以免影响生产。秦岭隧道北口开挖班工人彭邦其原定回家结婚，他父亲最近一连来了三封信催他回家，但他想到秦岭隧道是宝成铁路关键工程后，就决定将婚期推迟。
    各工厂的职工家属也纷纷保证自己丈夫或儿女春节前后照常出勤。鞍钢炼钢厂的家属委员会订了公约，保证丈夫或儿女春节前后休息好、吃得好，照常出勤。有的家属还准备邀请独身或离家远的工人一起过春节。武昌第一纱厂八百多职工代表和家属举行联欢会，互相提出关于春节前后不缺勤的保证。回乡的职工都表示一定要准时回厂，并努力做好工农联盟的宣传工作，动员自己的父母亲友参加互助组和农业生产合作社，把余粮卖给国家。
