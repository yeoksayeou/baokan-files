    ——A Newly Born Yingjiang National Hospital

    The Yingjiang Dam in the Yunnan border area, located on the southwestern border of Yunnan, is a county town in the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan. Before liberation, this was a disease-ridden area, and the brotherly ethnic groups living here never received medical prevention or treatment. For many years, the border people of all ethnic groups struggled painfully on the brink of death.
    Since the establishment of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture People's Government of Yunnan, the face of this place has changed rapidly. In order to develop the health undertakings of brotherly ethnic groups, the government built a beautiful and relatively well-equipped national hospital, which has internal medicine, surgery, and pediatrics departments. The establishment of this hospital has brought happiness to the people of all ethnic groups in Yingjiang area, enabling them to gradually get rid of the threat of disease. Working in the hospital are experienced veteran doctors, university graduates who have just come from the mainland, and Dai and Jingpo girls who have only recently started working. They are working for the happiness of all ethnic groups.
    When the people of all ethnic groups heard that Chairman Mao had built a brand-new hospital for them, they came here with indescribable feelings to treat diseases that had not been treated for many years. An old Jingpo woman in her fifties visited the hospital with tears of joy and said to the female nurse: "The Communist Party and Chairman Mao are really our great benefactors. They built a hospital for us in the mountains and sent doctors." (Attached pictures)
    The newly built Yingjiang National Hospital in Yunnan Province has brought happiness to the people of all ethnic groups on the Yunnan border.
    The government sent a large number of medical personnel and trained many medical workers from brotherly ethnic groups. This is a midwife explaining midwifery to Dai and Jingpo medical workers.

    山中医院
    ——一座新诞生的盈江民族医院
    于启河
    云南边疆的盈江坝子，在云南西南部的国境线上，是云南德宏傣族景颇族自治区的一个县城。解放前，这里是一个疾病流行的地区，住在这里的各兄弟民族是从来得不到医药上的预防和医疗的。多少年来，边疆的各族人民都在死亡线上痛苦地挣扎。
    云南德宏傣族景颇族自治区人民政府成立以后，这里的面貌就有了迅速的变化。政府为了发展兄弟民族的卫生事业，建造了一座美丽的、设备比较完善的民族医院，医院内设有内科、外科和小儿科等。这座医院的建立给盈江一带的各族人民带来了幸福，使他们能够逐步免除疾病的威胁。在医院里工作的有经验丰富的老医生，有刚从内地来的大学毕业生，还有参加工作不久的傣族和景颇族的姑娘，他们为各族人民的幸福而工作着。
    各族人民听到毛主席给他们盖了一座崭新的医院，都怀着难以形容的心情到这里医治多年没得到医治的疾病。一位五十多岁的景颇族老大娘含着喜悦的泪水参观了这座医院，向女护士说：“共产党和毛主席真是我们的大恩人，在大山里给我们盖了医院，派来了医生”。（附图片）
