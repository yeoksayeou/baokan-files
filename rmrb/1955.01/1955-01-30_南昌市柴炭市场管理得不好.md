To the Editor:

    Recently, in Nanchang city, the phenomenon of private merchants抢购 (qiǎnggòu - rush to purchase) firewood and charcoal has become very serious. Nanchang is a city with nearly 400,000 people, and usually needs a large amount of firewood and charcoal as fuel for cooking. After winter, people need to use charcoal for heating, and the demand increases even more. However, because the state-owned commercial departments in Nanchang city did not promptly secure sufficient supplies according to the needs of the citizens, a shortage of charcoal occurred not long after winter began. At the end of November last year, the Nanchang City Trade Company already experienced a complete sell-out of charcoal. Now, they have expanded the winter supply plan to more than 2 million catties, but it still cannot meet the needs of the market. As a result, some private merchants selling firewood and charcoal have taken the opportunity to become active. They use prices about 20% higher than the state-owned price to intercept and抢购 (qiǎnggòu - rush to purchase) on the outskirts of the city, and then sell it to citizens at prices more than double the state-owned retail price, so that some citizens are subjected to the high-interest exploitation of private merchants. The shortage of charcoal supply certainly has its objective difficulties, but if the state-owned commercial departments in Nanchang city had planned early for this major matter related to the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in the city, strengthened the management of the coal and charcoal market, and advocated that the masses use coal briquettes and coal dust, then the heating problem could be solved.

    南昌市柴炭市场管理得不好编辑同志：
    近来，南昌市的一些贩卖木炭的私商抢购柴、炭的现象很严重。南昌是一个拥有将近四十万人口的城市，平时每天需要大量的木柴、木炭作煮饭的燃料，入冬以后，人们要用木炭烤火取暖，需要量就更加增大了。但由于南昌市国营商业部门没有根据市民需要及早掌握充足的货源，以致入冬不久，就出现了木炭供应不足的现象。去年十一月底，南昌市贸易公司已发生了木炭脱销现象。现在，他们把冬季供应计划扩大到二百多万斤了，仍然不能满足市场的需要，于是一些贩卖柴、炭的私商们就乘机活动起来，他们用高出国营牌价百分之二十左右的价格到城郊拦路抢购，然后以超过国营零售牌价一倍以上的价格卖给市民，以致一部分市民受到了私商的高利剥削。木炭的供应不足，当然是有它客观困难的，但如果南昌市国营商业部门对这一关系全市数十万人民生活的大事，及早筹划，加强柴、炭市场的管理，并提倡群众采用煤块和煤屑。那么，取暖问题是可以解决的。　黎敏
