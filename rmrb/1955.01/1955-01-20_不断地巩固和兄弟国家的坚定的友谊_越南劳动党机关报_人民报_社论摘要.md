Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 18th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, Hanoi, January 18th: The "People's Daily", organ of the Vietnam Workers' Party, published an editorial today entitled "Continuously Consolidate the Firm Friendship with Fraternal Countries," commenting on the great significance of the establishment of diplomatic relations with fraternal countries.
    The editorial said: The position of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on foreign affairs is independence, self-determination, and resolute standing with the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union. For nine years, the government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have been continuously striving to consolidate the unshakable friendship between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and fraternal countries.
    The editorial also said: In 1950, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam began to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, and other people's democratic countries. Socialist and people's democratic countries, possessing nearly half of the world's total population, recognized the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The spirit of self-reliance of the Vietnamese people and the assistance of fraternal countries have enabled the patriotic war to win many victories, finally forcing the other party to hold negotiations in order to restore peace in Indochina on the basis of recognizing Vietnam's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. In the arduous and complex struggle to restore peace in Indochina, the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal countries, as well as the French people and peace-loving people all over the world, wholeheartedly supported the Vietnamese people.
    The editorial continued: The dispatch of ambassadors to the capital by fraternal countries proves that the friendship between Vietnam and fraternal countries has been further strengthened. Fraternal countries have been paying close attention to consolidating peace in Vietnam and have been assisting the Vietnamese people in building a peaceful life. Our fraternal countries, especially the People's Republic of China, have recently sent technicians and workers to assist the Vietnamese people, supplying machines, tools, rice, and cloth to help the Vietnamese people heal the wounds of war and revive their economy. The German Democratic Republic has also recently supplied the Vietnamese people with medicines, tools, and clothing. These generous and selfless assistance given by fraternal countries in the spirit of equality and friendship has greatly encouraged the Vietnamese people.
    After expressing gratitude to the fraternal countries, the editorial pointed out: Since the restoration of peace in Vietnam, the people and government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have developed relations with Southeast Asian countries and are seeking to establish normal relations with France. The visits of the Prime Ministers of India and Burma to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have paved the way for the establishment of diplomatic relations with Southeast Asian countries.
    The editorial concluded: In order to live up to the sincere assistance of the fraternal countries, the people of North Vietnam and South Vietnam will unite more closely than before and unite all forces to strive for the peace, unification, independence, and democracy of the motherland. At the same time, they will continuously consolidate the friendship between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the fraternal countries, and, in accordance with the five principles stipulated in the joint statement of the Prime Ministers of China and India and China and Burma, which President Ho Chi Minh has expressed his approval and support for, develop diplomatic relations with the governments of the Kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia, Southeast Asian countries, and France.

    不断地巩固和兄弟国家的坚定的友谊
    ——越南劳动党机关报“人民报”社论摘要
    【新华社十八日讯】据越南通讯社河内十八日讯：越南劳动党机关报“人民报”今天以“不断地巩固和兄弟国家的坚定的友谊”为题发表社论，评述和兄弟国家建立邦交日的重大意义。
    社论说：越南民主共和国关于对外事务的立场是独立、自决和坚决地同以苏联为首的和平民主阵营站在一起。越南民主共和国政府和人民九年来一直在不断地努力巩固越南民主共和国和兄弟国家之间的不可动摇的友谊。
    社论又说：一九五零年，越南民主共和国开始和中华人民共和国、苏联以及其他的人民民主国家建立外交关系。拥有全世界人口总数将近一半的社会主义国家和人民民主国家，都承认了越南民主共和国。越南人民的自力更生的精神和兄弟国家的帮助使爱国战争多次获得胜利，最后迫使对方举行谈判，以便在承认越南的独立、主权和领土完整的基础上恢复印度支那的和平。在恢复印度支那和平的艰巨和复杂的斗争中，苏联、中国和其他兄弟国家以及法国人民和全世界爱好和平的人们都衷心地支持越南人民。
    社论接着说：各兄弟国家派大使到首都来，证明越南和各兄弟国家间的友谊已经进一步加强。各兄弟国家一直在非常注意巩固越南的和平，并一直在援助越南人民建立和平生活。我们的兄弟国家、尤其是中华人民共和国最近派遣技术人员和工人来援助越南人民，供应机器、工具、大米和布匹来援助越南人民医治战争的创伤和复兴他们的经济。德意志民主共和国最近也以医药、工具和衣服等供应越南人民。各兄弟国家本着平等和友好的精神所给予的这些慷慨无私的援助，使越南人民得到了极大的鼓舞。
    社论在向各兄弟国家表示感谢后指出：自从越南恢复和平以来，越南民主共和国的人民和政府发展了和东南亚国家之间的关系，并且正在设法和法国建立正常关系。印度和缅甸的总理到越南民主共和国来访问，已经为和东南亚国家建立外交关系铺平了道路。
    社论最后说：为了不辜负各兄弟国家的真诚的援助，北越以及南越的人民将比以前更加密切地团结起来，并团结一切的力量为争取祖国的和平、统一、独立与民主而奋斗。同时，他们将不断地巩固越南民主共和国和各兄弟国家之间的友谊，根据中印和中缅总理的联合声明中所规定的、胡志明主席已经表示赞成和支持的五项原则，开展和老挝和柬埔寨王国政府、东南亚国家以及法国之间的外交关系。
