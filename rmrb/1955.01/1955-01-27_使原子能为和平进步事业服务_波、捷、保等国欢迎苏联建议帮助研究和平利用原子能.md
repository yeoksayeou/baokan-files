Xinhua News Agency, January 26th: According to TASS, Warsaw, January 25th: Polish People's Republic Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Cyrankiewicz, wrote a letter to the Soviet Council of Ministers, expressing satisfaction and gratitude for the Soviet government's statement proposing to provide assistance to the Polish People's Republic in promoting research into the peaceful uses of atomic energy and in building the necessary equipment for producing atomic energy for experimental purposes.

The letter stated: "Today, a great struggle is taking place in the world to prevent atomic energy from being used for aggression and the destruction of mankind, and to make atomic energy serve peace, cultural progress, and cooperation among all peoples. Leading the world in this struggle is the Soviet Union—the builder of the world's first atomic energy power station. The Soviet government's declaration proposing to give assistance to Poland, People's China, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, and Romania in promoting research into atomic energy, together with the statement that such assistance could also be given to other countries, and the decision to report on the Soviet Union's experience in the peaceful use of atomic energy at international conferences, eloquently prove the Soviet Union's consistent efforts to implement the fundamental principles of its policy of peace and cooperation among all peoples. This policy immeasurably strengthens the power and solidarity of the peace camp and enhances its international prestige.

"The Polish people unanimously and wholeheartedly support this noble and far-sighted policy, which aims to isolate the instigators of war and strengthen the forces of peace."
    
Xinhua News Agency, January 26th: According to TASS, Prague, January 23rd: The Presidium of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences held a meeting to discuss the Soviet government's decision to provide other countries with scientific, technical, and industrial assistance in promoting the peaceful uses of atomic energy. A communique issued after the meeting stated that with the assistance of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovak scientists would do everything possible to put atomic energy to peaceful use in Czechoslovakia as soon as possible.

Some leaders of the scientific and cultural circles in Czechoslovakia issued an open letter to scientists and cultural workers in Western countries on the 22nd. The letter expressed sincere satisfaction with the Soviet Union's readiness to make public the experience of the first atomic energy industrial power station. The letter condemned the decision adopted by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council to seriously threaten all mankind by preparing for atomic war and called on scientists and cultural workers in Western countries to join with the people of the world to fight against atomic war.
    
Xinhua News Agency, January 26th: According to TASS, Sofia: The Bulgarian Academy of Sciences held a special meeting on the 22nd to discuss the issue of atomic energy. The meeting adopted an appeal from the Presidium of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences to scientists of all countries, calling on them to fight for the prohibition of atomic weapons and for the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes.

Bulgarian scientists who spoke at the meeting indignantly spoke about the governments of certain countries, especially the US government, which are conspiring to use atomic energy as a tool of destruction and mass murder. They welcomed the Soviet government's proposal to provide scientific, technical, and production assistance to other countries in promoting the peaceful uses of atomic energy.

    信里说：“今天在世界上正在进行一场伟大的斗争，要使原子能不被用于侵略和毁灭人类，而使原子能为和平、文化进步和各国人民之间的合作服务。领导着全世界进行这场斗争的就是苏联——世界上第一个原子能动力站的建造者。苏联政府关于在促进原子能的研究方面建议给波兰、人民中国、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国和罗马尼亚以帮助的声明，连同关于这种援助也可以给予其他国家的声明，以及关于向国际会议报告苏联在和平利用原子能方面的经验的决定，雄辩地证明了苏联一贯为实行它的和平和各国人民之间的合作的政策的基本原则而努力。这个政策不可估量地加强了和平阵营的力量和团结，并且提高了它的国际威望。
    “波兰人民一致衷心支持这个目的在于孤立战争鼓吹者和加强和平力量的崇高的有远见的政策。”

    捷克斯洛伐克一些科学界和文化界的领袖二十二日发表了一封致西方国家科学家和文化工作者的公开信。信中对苏联准备公开第一个原子能工业电力站的经验表示真诚的满意。信中谴责北大西洋公约组织理事会通过的关于准备原子战争来严重威胁全人类的决定并号召西方国家科学家和文化工作者同全世界人民一道共同为反对原子战争而斗争。　　【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社索非亚讯：保加利亚科学院二十二日举行特别会议讨论原子能问题。会议通过保加利亚科学院主席团致各国科学家的一封呼吁书，呼吁各国科学家为禁止原子武器、争取将原子能用于和平目的而斗争。
