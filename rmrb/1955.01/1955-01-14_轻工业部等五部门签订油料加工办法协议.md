The Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Local Industry, the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Food, and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives recently jointly signed an agreement on methods for processing vegetable oilseeds. This agreement will play a significant role in the rational utilization of oilseed resources and the increase of vegetable oil production.

This agreement addresses one of the main problems currently existing in oil production: irrational oilseed processing methods. Currently, the oilseed processing methods implemented in most areas determine processing fees based solely on the quantity of oilseeds processed, with insufficient attention paid to oil yield and residual oil content in the oilcake. The vast majority of oil mills, in order to earn more processing fees, single-mindedly pursue the quantity of pressing, resulting in excessive pressing during peak seasons, frequent mechanical failures, and shutdowns due to lack of materials during off-seasons. At the same time, factories fail to pay attention to technological improvements, and oil yields cannot be improved in the long term, resulting in significant losses of oil. The implementation of the new oilseed processing methods will change this irrational phenomenon.

The oilseed processing method agreement stipulates that oilseeds should be allocated rationally in the future. Departments entrusting processing should prioritize supplying oilseeds to advanced state-owned, locally state-owned, cooperative-operated, and joint state-private oil mills, and appropriately accommodate private oil mills. In order to supply edible oil to small and medium-sized cities and rural areas, appropriate arrangements should also be made for traditional oil presses.

The agreement specifies detailed standards for oil delivery quotas for factories. For example, for screw oil mills processing 100 jin of peanuts with 50% oil content, the maximum oil delivery quota is 47.6 jin, and the minimum is 46.3 jin; for every 100 jin of cottonseed with 20% oil content, the maximum oil delivery quota is 17.4 jin, and the minimum is 16.5 jin. The agreement states: In order to encourage the enthusiasm of factory operations and improve oil yield from oilseeds, the oil delivery quotas of each factory can be calculated and determined based on the local medium-level technical standards, combined with the factory's previous average oil delivery rate, and with reference to the oil delivery rate standards specified in the agreement. If the quality of the oilseeds does not meet the requirements, the oil delivery quota should be increased or decreased accordingly. Oilcake should be delivered and paid for based on actual production, and other by-products should, in principle, be handled by the factory itself.

The agreement also provides detailed regulations on the quality standards of oils. It stipulates that for factories with refining equipment, the moisture and impurities in the oil should not exceed 0.4%, and only a small amount of sediment is allowed when various oils are heated to 250 degrees Celsius.

Regarding oilseed processing fees, the agreement stipulates the implementation of a progressive commission reward method. In general, processing fees should be calculated based on the average cost of medium-level factories in the region, plus a reasonable profit. Factories that improve technology and increase oil yield to achieve excess production of oil can be rewarded according to the principle of higher commission for higher excess production and lower commission for lower excess production. The portion of oil rewarded will be purchased in full by the oil company at the local purchase price.

In addition, the agreement also makes clear provisions for the term of the processing contract and the testing of raw materials and finished products, all in accordance with the spirit of encouraging factories to improve their operations. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 轻工业部等五部门签订油料加工办法协议

    轻工业部等五部门签订油料加工办法协议
    轻工业部、地方工业部、商业部、粮食部和中华全国供销合作总社最近共同签订了关于植物油料加工办法的协议。这个协议对于合理地利用油料资源，增加植物油的产量将起很大作用。
    这个协议是针对目前油脂生产中的主要问题之一——油料加工办法不合理的现象而提出来的。目前大部分地区所实行的油料加工办法，单纯看加工油料的数量来确定加工费，而对于产油率、油饼残油率的高低却重视不够。绝大多数的榨油厂为了多得加工费，就单纯追求压榨数量，因而在旺季超量压榨，机械事故不断发生，淡季却停工待料；同时各厂不注意去改进技术，产油率长期不能提高，使大量油脂受到损失。新的油料加工办法实行以后，就将改变这种不合理的现象。
    油料加工办法协议中规定今后要合理地分配油料。委托加工的部门应该把油料优先供应先进的国营、地方国营、合作社营和公私合营榨油厂，适当照顾私营油厂；为了供应中小城镇和农村食用油的需要，对于土榨油坊也要给予适当的安排。
    协议中对于工厂的交油定额规定了详细的标准。例如螺旋机榨油厂每加工一百斤含油百分之五十的花生，交油定额最高是四十七点六斤，最低是四十六点三斤；每加工一百斤含油百分之二十的棉籽，交油定额最高是十七点四斤，最低是十六点五斤。协议中说：为了鼓励工厂经营的积极性，提高油料出油率，各厂的交油定额可以根据当地的中等技术标准，结合本厂前期的平均交油率，参照协议中规定的交油率标准来计算确定。油料的质量如果不合规定时，应该相应地增加或减少交油定额。油饼实产实缴，其他副产品原则上由工厂自行处理。
    协议中对于油脂的质量标准也作了详细规定。其中规定有精炼设备的工厂，油中的水份杂质不得超过百分之零点四，各种油脂加热到摄氏二百五十度时只许有少量的沉淀物。
    关于油料加工费用，协议中规定实行超额累进提成奖励的办法。一般应按照本地区内中等水平工厂的平均成本，加上适当的利润来计算加工费。工厂因为改进技术、提高产油率而超额增产的油脂，可以按照超额多提成多、超额少提成少的原则给予奖励。提出奖励的这部分油脂，由油脂公司按照当地的收购牌价全部收购。
    此外，协议中对于加工合同的期限、原料和成品的化验等，也都根据鼓励各厂改善经营的精神，作了明确的规定。（新华社）
