Those Building the Jining-Erlian Railway

    In a Blizzard
    In January 1953, before the Jining-Erlian Railway project had even started, strenuous route surveying was underway. The Inner Mongolian grassland was hit by a four-day blizzard, with snowflakes pelting people's faces and temperatures dropping to minus thirty-eight degrees Celsius.
    The comrades of the southern section's route survey team braved the blizzard, following the newly marked wooden stakes from Tumurtai southwards. The stakes were completely covered in snow, so they had to dig through the snow by hand, one by one. By the end, everyone's hands were numb and useless. Their legs were buried in a foot of snow, making it difficult and slow to pull each leg out. As a result, the journey from Tumurtai to Hanjia Village, just over forty li, took eleven hours. They arrived at Hanjia Village after nine o'clock in the evening. They stayed at an old man's house. The old man asked:
  "Why are you enduring such hardship? Where are you going?" They replied: "We are building a railway. Soon a train will be running in front of your house!" The old man was so happy he couldn't stop smiling.
    The comrades lay on the heated kang, but it took a long time to warm up. At midnight, Section Chief Ding and Huang Yujun got up again and went out in the snow to find a car. The car had broken down due to a frozen axle. It wasn't until 3 a.m. that the car reached Hanjia Village. Seeing that two workers' feet and hands were frozen and they couldn't walk, Section Chief Ding carried them back to the old man's house one by one.
    In four days, the comrades returned to Jining with victorious smiles and a tale of hard-won success.

    Overcoming Water Scarcity
    On the vast grasslands of Inner Mongolia, lush pastures nurture herds of cattle and sheep. However, this beautiful and rich grassland is severely short of water. Near the Jining-Erlian Railway's northern section, spanning over two hundred kilometers, there were only three or four wells. The well-digging team drilled over two hundred wells along the line, but only seventy-one produced water. Due to the lack of water, concrete projects sometimes couldn't be cured, machines stopped running, and workers often couldn't cook meals on time.
    The grassland stretched endlessly. Where could they find water?
    The workers turned to the herders who had lived on the grasslands for generations. Minda Boliyin, a man in his sixties, rode his horse and led the workers to several old wells. The herders near Hulimiao shared their water-drawing well with the workers of the Twelfth Work Zone. The Living Buddha Damuren Wangjile also revealed well-digging methods in the grassland that he had never told anyone. Experienced Mongolians pointed out well locations, and most of them yielded water.
    However, many wells were far from the living quarters, especially in the desert areas, where ox carts, horse carts, and cars couldn't travel, making water transportation even more difficult. The members of Bairenlai's Second Mutual Aid Team volunteered to lend their eight camels to the work zone for carrying water without any compensation. These eight camels served the railway from May to November last year. The Mongolians said, "We also have a part in building the railway!"

    Conquering the Desert
    Building a railway in the desert was a first in China's railway history. From Jining northward, there is a desert in the central part of the Xilingol League, and the Jining-Erlian Railway had to pass through this desert to connect with the Mongolian railway. The workers of the Twelfth Work Zone fought the desert for more than seven months from April last year, building a solid roadbed and ensuring that the track-laying team could lay the rails to Erlian ahead of schedule.
    In the desert, "cars couldn't travel easily" and "people couldn't walk steadily." When a car drove into the desert, half a wheel would sink into the sand and spin uselessly. When people walked, lifting the left leg would cause the right leg to slide backward, taking half a step back for every step forward. Building the roadbed was even more difficult. As soon as a foot was placed on the slope, it would slide down with the sand. To overcome the difficulties of shifting sand, the workers erected scaffolding on both sides of the roadbed and laid wooden planks from the soil extraction pit to the roadbed, solving the problem of walking.
    As the workers labored diligently, the roadbed stretched forward neatly. Suddenly, a strong wind blew the roadbed away. When a strong wind came, yellow sand filled the sky, and people couldn't see each other. The gale carried sand, hitting the face like needle pricks. Larger grains of sand flowed with the wind, sometimes piling up into a small sand dune, which would be blown away by another gust of wind.
  To prevent the roadbed from being blown away by the wind and to ensure future traffic safety, Soviet experts suggested wrapping the roadbed with red clay and planting grass. The workers followed the Soviet experts' advice, building the roadbed while wrapping it with clay, so the roadbed steadily stretched forward layer by layer, section by section. During the road construction process, Soviet experts also told the workers to protect the surface of the desert, setting up soil extraction pits on the leeward side to prevent the wind from "moving" the sand.
    The desert was finally conquered by the heroic railway builders. By mid-October, a magnificent roadbed stood tall in the desert. The Mongolian brothers and sisters from nearby brought cream and milk wine to express their gratitude. They thanked Chairman Mao for sending the railway builders, who would bring a happy life to the grassland, and pledged to protect the railway.

    Fighting the Floods
    Many stories of fighting floods circulate on the Jining-Erlian Railway construction site. Here is one of them.
    On July 17th last year, the flood-proof trestle of the Bawang River temporary bridge, the first bridge on the Jining-Erlian line, was washed away by floodwaters. "Each section of the trestle represents the hard work and sweat of countless people!" Labor Model Wang Huaiyou thought as he looked down: muddy floodwaters rushed under the bridge, and the bridge body creaked. He then ran to the section chief and asked to be sent to rescue the section of the trestle.
    More than an hour passed, and the sound of the trestle grew louder. The leading cadres and workers on the shore shouted at Wang Huaiyou to come up quickly.
    The trestle was constantly being lifted by the impact of the flood, and it looked like it was about to be washed away. "What will happen to the construction if the trestle is washed away?" Wang Huaiyou grabbed a thick rope and climbed onto the trestle again. The sound of the wind and waves roared like a pack of wild beasts. The flood soaked his clothes, but Wang Huaiyou persisted in his work.
    The trestle was tied. Wang Huaiyou carefully handed the rope to the workers on the shore. At that moment, a wave crashed head-on, and Wang Huaiyou's vision went dark. He struggled with difficulty, being pulled from one whirlpool to another. At this time, a dozen comrades ran along the riverbank to search, and finally rescued him from the water nine hundred meters away from the bridge. The doctor injected Wang Huaiyou with a cardiotonic. After he woke up, he opened his pale lips and said urgently, "Comrades, please take me back to the bridge quickly, my task is not yet completed."

    Old Boiler Foreman Qin Youcai
    Qin Youcai, a fifty-four-year-old boiler foreman, was transferred from the Wuhan Bridge Engineering Bureau to the Jining-Erlian Railway last June. Over the years, he had dedicated his skills to the Jiangjiang Flood Diversion, the Xiangjiang Bridge, and the Wuhan Bridge projects. When the motherland needed him, he came to the Inner Mongolian grassland again.
    Once, the Jining Locomotive Depot sent a locomotive to the Taiyuan Locomotive Depot for "Class A inspection." The Taiyuan Locomotive Depot found that three rivets on the throat plate of the boiler were leaking. Fearing that it would affect their unit's tasks, they wanted to send the locomotive to the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory for "medium repair." (Note: Medium repair costs 190 million yuan more than Class A inspection.) Qin Youcai and boiler worker Zhang Tingjian went to the Taiyuan Locomotive Depot. They carefully checked the extent of the locomotive's leakage and asked the train crew about the leakage situation. Based on decades of experience and the Ministry of Railways' "Locomotive Maintenance Regulations," Qin Youcai determined that "medium repair" was not necessary and actively suggested to the Taiyuan Locomotive Branch to hold a maintenance meeting. At the meeting, Qin Youcai patiently explained the provisions of the maintenance regulations to the leading cadres and technical personnel of the Taiyuan Locomotive Branch and Depot, and volunteered to take on the maintenance task.
    Fifty-year-old Qin Youcai squeezed into the boiler and worked intensely. The motherland's construction cause inspired him, making him forget his fatigue. In just three days, he repaired the leaking rivets. In order to unite with the fraternal unit with his practical actions, he also actively helped the Taiyuan Locomotive Depot repair fifteen rivets.

    建设集二铁路的人们
      在暴风雪里
    一九五三年一月，集二线工程还未动工，艰苦的线路调查工作正在紧张进行。内蒙古草原一连刮了四天大风暴，雪片直向人们脸上猛打，气温降到零下三十八度。
    南段线路调查组的同志们，冒着暴风雪，顺着新定线的木桩从土木尔台向南调查。线路的木桩完全被雪盖住了，他们就用手扒开雪，一个一个地找。每一个人扒到最后，两只手都不会活动了。一双腿埋在一尺厚的深雪里，拔出这条腿，再拔那条腿，又费劲又慢。所以从土木尔台到韩家村仅四十多华里，却走了十一个钟头。晚上九点多钟才到韩家村。他们在一位老伯伯家住下来，老伯伯问：
  “你们这样子吃苦，要向那里去呀？”他们答：“我们是修铁路的，不久就要在你的门前跑火车了！”老伯伯听了，高兴得合不拢嘴。
    调查组的同志们躺在热炕上，好半天还暖不过来。夜里十二点钟，丁段长和黄宇钧又爬起来冒着雪去寻找汽车。原来汽车因中轴冻断而抛了锚。直到下半夜三点钟，汽车才到韩家村。丁段长见两个工人的脚和手都冻僵，不能走路了，就一个一个把他们背回老伯伯家中去。
    在四天的时间里，同志们终于带着胜利的微笑和艰苦的奇迹回到了集宁。
    战胜了缺水的困难
    在内蒙古辽阔的草原上，茂密的牧草养育着一群群的牛羊。但是在这美丽而富饶的草原上，却十分缺水。集二线北段两百多公里的线路附近，只有三、四口井，挖井队在沿线打了二百多眼，只有七十一眼井出水。因为缺水，有时混凝土工程没有水养生，机器就停止了运转，工人们则常因缺水而不能按时做饭。
    草原一望无边，从那里才能找到水呢？
    工人们找到了祖祖辈辈生活在草原上的牧民们。六十多岁的蒙民达博利音，骑着马，领着工人们找到了几眼旧井；呼里庙附近的牧民，把自己汲水的井和十二工区的工人合用；活佛达木仁旺吉勒也把从没告诉过别人的在草原上打井的方法，告诉给工人们，有经验的蒙民指出打井的地点，大部分井都打出了水。
    但是，有很多井离住地很远，特别是在沙漠地带，牛车、马车、汽车都不能走，运水更困难。蒙民柏仁莱第二互助组的组员们知道这个消息后，不要酬劳，把组里八只骆驼长期借给工区驮水。这八只骆驼从去年五月到十一月，一直为铁路服务。蒙民们说：“修铁路我们也有份儿啊！”
    征服了沙漠
    在沙漠上修筑铁路，在我国铁路史上还是第一次。从集宁向北，在锡林郭勒盟大草原中部有一片沙漠，集二线就要穿过这段沙漠和蒙古铁路连接起来。十二工区的工人们，从去年四月起，和沙漠搏斗了七个多月，筑成了坚固的路基，保证了钉道队提前把钢轨铺到二连。
    沙漠上“车不好行”“人不好走”，汽车一开到沙漠上，半个轮子就陷到沙子里打空转。人们走起路来，抬起左腿，右腿就向后滑，走一步退半步。筑路基的时候更困难，脚刚踏到边坡上就和沙子一道溜下来。工人们为了克服流沙的困难，在路基两旁搭起脚手架，从取土坑到路基旁，铺上一道木板，解决了走路问题。
    随着工人们的辛勤劳动，路基在整齐地向前伸展，忽然一阵大风把路基刮走了。大风一来，黄沙满天，对面不见人；狂风夹着沙子，打在脸上像针刺的一样痛。大一些的沙砾顺着风向流动，有时堆成一座小沙山，一阵风来，沙山又被刮走。
  苏联专家为了使路基不被大风吹走，并保证将来的行车安全，建议把路基用红黏土包起来，栽上草。工人们执行了苏联专家的建议，一面筑路基，一面包黏土，路基就一层层、一节节稳固地伸向前方。在筑路过程中，苏联专家又告诉工人们要保护沙漠的表面，取土坑要设在避风的一方，防止大风把沙子“搬家”。
    沙漠，终于被英雄的筑路工人征服了，到十月中旬，一条雄伟的路基屹立在沙漠上。附近的蒙族弟兄带着奶油、奶酒前来慰问，他们感谢毛主席派来的筑路工人给草原即将带来的幸福生活，保证把铁路保护好。
    向洪水作斗争
    在集二线工地里流传着许多向洪水作斗争的故事。下面就是其中的一个。
    去年七月十七日，集二线上第一座桥——霸王河便桥的防水排架被洪水冲起。“一孔排架是由多少劳动人民的血汗换来的呵！”劳动模范王怀友一边想着一边向下看：混浊的洪水在桥下奔流，桥身发出吱吱呀呀的声音。接着他就跑到段长跟前，要求派他去救出这孔排架。
    过了一个多钟头，排架的响声越来越大了。在岸上的领导干部和工人们，都喊叫王怀友赶快上来。
    排架在洪水冲击下不断地掀动，眼看就要被冲到远方去。“如果排架冲走了，耽误施工怎么办？”王怀友拿着一根粗大的绳子又爬上了排架。风声和浪涛声像一群野兽在狂吼，洪水浸透了衣服，王怀友仍然坚持着工作。
    排架拴好了。王怀友小心地把绳子递给了岸上的工人。正在这一霎那，一个浪头迎面扑来，王怀友眼前一阵昏暗，他吃力地挣扎着，从一个漩涡卷到另一个漩涡。这时，十来个同志沿着河岸奔跑寻找，终于在离桥九百公尺的地方，把他从水中救出来。医生为王怀友注射了强心剂，他苏醒过来之后张着苍白的嘴唇急促地说：“同志，请快送我回桥上去，我的任务还没有完成。”
    老锅炉工长秦有才
    五十四岁的锅炉工长秦有才在去年六月由武汉大桥工程局调到集二线上。几年来，他曾把自己的技术献给荆江分洪、湘江大桥和武汉大桥等建设工程；当祖国需要他的时候，他又来到了内蒙古草原上。
    一次，集宁机务段把一台机车送到太原机务段去“甲检”。太原机务段发现锅炉喉板拉条铆钉泄漏三根，怕影响本单位的任务，要把机车送长辛店机车车辆修理工厂去“中修”。（按：中修比甲检要多化一亿九千万元）秦有才和锅炉工张廷鉴到了太原机务段。他们细心地检查了机车泄漏的程度，向乘务员了解了泄漏情况。秦有才根据几十年的经验和铁道部颁布的
  “机车保养规则”的规定，认定可以不要“中修”，并积极向太原机务处建议召开检修会议。在会上，秦有才耐心地向太原机务处、段的领导干部和技术人员解释保养规则的规定，并主动要求担负起这一检修任务。
    五十多岁的秦有才，局缩在锅炉里，紧张地劳动起来。祖国的建设事业鼓舞着他，使得他忘记了劳累。仅仅三天的工夫，他就修好了泄漏的铆钉。为了用自己的实际行动来团结兄弟单位，他还主动地帮助太原机务段检修了十五颗铆钉。
