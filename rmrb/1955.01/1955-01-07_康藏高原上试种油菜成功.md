    Successful Trial Planting of Rapeseed on the Kangzang Plateau

    In the past, only a very few areas with lower altitudes and warmer climates in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province, in the eastern part of the Kangzang Plateau, had people growing rapeseed. No one had ever tried planting it in the vast, high-altitude cold regions. Last year, the state-owned Xinduqiao Mechanical Farm successfully trial-planted rapeseed at an altitude of 3,400 meters, with a yield of 200 jin per mu. When the Muya District of Kangding County held a district people's representative meeting, the representatives, after hearing a report from comrades of the state-owned Xinduqiao Mechanical Farm on their experience in growing rapeseed, decided to mobilize the masses to plant rapeseed extensively throughout the district this year. It is estimated that the planting area will reach more than 900 mu. Next year, the local trading company will also build an oil pressing workshop.

    For generations, the Tibetan people have relied on cutting down the roots and stems of pine trees with high oil content for lighting. Therefore, the gradual promotion of rapeseed planting is of great importance for improving the lives of the Tibetan people and protecting the rich forest resources on the plateau.

    康藏高原上试种油菜成功
    康藏高原东部的西康省藏族自治区，过去只有极少数地势较低、气候暖和的地方，才有人种油菜，广大高寒地带，从没有人试种过。去年，国营新都桥机械农场在拔海三千四百公尺的地带试种油菜获得成功，每亩产量达二百斤。康定县木雅区召开区人民代表会议时，代表们听了国营新都桥机械农场同志关于种油菜的经验的报告后，决定今年在全区发动群众普遍种油菜。预计种植面积可达九百余亩。明年，当地的贸易公司也要建立一座榨油房。
    藏族人民世代以来，都是靠砍伐含油脂浓厚的松树的根、茎作照明用，因而油菜种植的逐步推广，对于改善藏族人民的生活和保护高原上丰富的森林资源都有重要作用。
