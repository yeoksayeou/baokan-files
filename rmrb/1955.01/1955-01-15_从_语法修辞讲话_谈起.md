    Starting from "Lectures on Grammar and Rhetoric"
    Ye Shengtao
    Recently, quite a few articles have appeared in "Chinese Language" discussing issues of Chinese grammar, especially the issue of word classes. I am an amateur and cannot add a word of praise. I want to talk about another aspect.
    Language and writing matters can probably be discussed from two aspects. One is what rules language itself has, how to use it appropriately, and how it is inappropriate to use it in other ways. In simple terms, it is the right or wrong, gain or loss in practical usage. The other aspect is how to understand these rules. This is scientific theory, and there is much to be done here. The gentlemen who contribute to "Chinese Language" are talking about the latter aspect, while I want to talk about the former. I want to start from "Lectures on Grammar and Rhetoric."
    "Lectures on Grammar and Rhetoric" began to appear in "People's Daily" on June 6, 1951, twice a week, and it took several months to publish all six lectures. At that time, Mr. Lü Shuxiang and Mr. Zhu Dexi were asked to write these "Lectures" because everyone felt that there was some confusion in language use. You say it's confusing, and I say it's confusing, but how can we eliminate the phenomenon of confusion? How can we make our language pure and healthy? This necessitates an investigation into the practical use of language. The "Lectures" were published in the "People's Daily" and later printed as a separate book. There were so many readers who not only read it but also had many units organized learning sessions, taking it as a learning material. The responses were diverse. Some said that it really solved some practical problems in language use. Some said it was confusing and caused more trouble than it solved. Some insisted on studying until the last lecture, saying that without seeing the whole picture, one cannot get the benefits and cannot blame others. Some gave up halfway, finding it too difficult to learn, saying that grammar is too verbose, and it's better to speak and write according to usual habits… Furthermore, since these "Lectures" were published, the masses have generally recognized that grammar is very important. Even those who find grammar too verbose recognize that so many people now value grammar. This is the influence of the "Lectures" being published in "People's Daily." However, there are not many articles commenting on the "Lectures." There have been some comments on individual points, but there seem to be even fewer comprehensive reviews. The editors of "People's Daily" wrote an editor's note when they started publishing the "Lectures," saying that if there were different opinions, they could be brought up for discussion. This editor's note seemed to have anticipated such a situation.
    The "Lectures" are different from other grammar books. It not only explains some terms and formats, not only lists some examples for those terms and formats, but also points out some defects in practical use and discusses those defects. For example, when talking about the subject (in the fourth lecture), it not only explains what a subject is but also points out that some sentences have a subject but lack a suitable predicate, some sentences have a predicate but lack a suitable subject, some sentences have an inappropriate subject-predicate combination, some sentences repeat the subject, and some sentences secretly change the subject, and so on. This method is good. It makes the "Lectures" have practical significance. Even if some discussions are still open to discussion, the majority that does not need discussion is very helpful to people.
    The fifth lecture discusses rhetoric, and the author declares that the focus is on "clarity," followed by "conciseness." This means that this section discusses matters of negative rhetoric. As for how to make the form better, and what kind of form to use to express content to achieve greater effects, those matters belonging to the area of positive rhetoric are temporarily not discussed. The author probably thinks like this: Under normal circumstances, one should first strive for "no fault," and on the basis of "no fault," then calmly seek "merit." Some phenomena in language use pointed out in this part, we don't pay attention to, nor do we feel anything is wrong. Once the author points it out, we realize that there are indeed some problems.
    The sixth lecture discusses the use of punctuation, focusing on analyzing difficulties.
    Looking at the whole, the fourth and fifth lectures are considered to be better written, while the second lecture is relatively poor. The second lecture discusses the use of words, and there are probably the most places for discussion in this part. The third lecture discusses function words, and there are also quite a few places for discussion, such as "some, some of," "for…and…," "extend to." According to the current situation, some usages criticized by the author are precisely what everyone is happy to use and feels are appropriate, which shows that the author's approach is not entirely correct.
    According to the opinions of many readers, the requirements of the "Lectures" seem a bit harsh. This is also not right, that is also not suitable. Speaking and writing are originally very common things. How could it be so thorny everywhere? Especially for beginners in writing, if they use the "Lectures" as learning materials, they are very likely to make the mistake of being constrained and hampered, which would be "not only useless but also harmful." I think that since the "Lectures" were written to support the call of the "People's Daily" editorial "Use the motherland's language correctly, and fight for the purity and health of the language!", it is necessary to collect some impure and unhealthy examples for discussion. In fact, there are so many types of examples that we cannot blame the author for collecting too many—although it can be debated whether some examples are pure and healthy or not. However, if we appropriately increase some positive (pure, healthy) examples and reduce some less common negative examples, then people can learn more from them, and it can save unnecessary speculation, and the effect should be better.
    In addition, two points can be pointed out, which should be the shortcomings of the "Lectures." It only talks about sentences, not paragraphs and chapters. Most general grammar books are originally like this. However, since the "Lectures" combines grammar and rhetoric, and since it focuses on discussing the use of language, it cannot be separated from the coherence of thought, and the coherence of thought is often seen when forming paragraphs and chapters. Two sentences are complete when viewed separately, but they are not corresponding when linked together, so it cannot be said that the language is used appropriately. Two paragraphs are acceptable when viewed separately, but they cannot be connected, so it also cannot be said that the language is used appropriately. Therefore, to give readers more help, there should be some discussion on the relationship between the next sentence and the previous sentence, and the next paragraph and the previous paragraph. Unfortunately, the "Lectures" did not do this. Secondly, looking at the current situation, the application of long sentences is becoming more and more widespread, and long sentences are very prone to problems. For the sake of readers, more space should be devoted to discussing long sentences. The "Lectures" talk about it too little. Section 9 of the fourth lecture points out various structural problems, which is useful, but the positive long sentences are only analyzed in three sentences at the end of the first lecture, which is not enough.
    The "Lectures" focuses on the right and wrong, gain and loss in the practical use of language. Since it talks about right and wrong, gain and loss, there must be some selection. Everyone will not have the same opinion on making judgments and setting choices. If opinions differ, they must be discussed. At that time, the editor's note of "People's Daily" hoped that everyone would discuss it, and I have also been hoping that everyone would discuss it, because language is a tool for exchanging thoughts, and how to use it appropriately is our personal matter. Focusing on the practical use of language is actually discussing the standardization of literary language (the term "literary language" is similar to what we have called "elegant language" since ancient times, which is a language that everyone understands and has no barriers to, and can be used for conversations, speeches, reports, and also for writing ordinary articles and literary works), although the "Lectures" did not explicitly propose it. Furthermore, everyone hopes to eliminate the phenomenon of language confusion, which, conversely, is not hoping for standardization? Once standardized, there will be no confusion. Once standardized, saying east is east, saying west is west, coming from your mouth and entering my heart, clearly and completely, only then can full communication be achieved. Standardization is an important task in language work. If nothing is done in this area, many things are not easy to do, such as language reform, compiling dictionaries, compiling textbooks, and so on. Everyone doesn't seem to care much about this issue. I earnestly hope that everyone will care about it, especially linguists.
    Some people believe that the current written language is "variegated and chaotic. It is truly a labor in vain to try to organize a set of rules for it and teach people to learn it" (Lu Zongda, Yu Min: "Modern Chinese Grammar" p. 10). This is one point of view. This view believes that one cannot discuss written language by just talking about written language, but can only use spoken language to measure written language, keeping what fits and discarding what doesn't. Of course, there is some truth to this statement, but is it comprehensive, and is the relationship between written language and spoken language so simple? This is worth discussing. The authors of the "Lectures" also paid attention to the relationship between written language and spoken language, and also put forward some opinions on the handling of ancient components and foreign components, but it seems that they believe that basically a set of rules can be organized in the current written language. Whether this can be done, which aspects of the "Lectures" are done well, and which aspects are not done well, are all open to discussion and should be discussed. After discussion, affirm what should be affirmed, negate what should be negated, and then summarize some principles and theories, which would be of great benefit—beneficial to those who speak and write Chinese. Of course, things will not be so simple. In the process of analyzing doubts and distinguishing difficulties, problems will lead to problems, and many problems that were not raised in the "Lectures" will also have the opportunity to be brought up for discussion. If we recognize such a premise, that standardization is necessary and possible, then the discussion will not be too broad or too complicated.
    One point in passing. Since we are talking about grammar, we cannot do without a system of terminology. I think that the system of terminology used in the "Lectures" is a compromise of various schools of thought, or more precisely, it is between the schools of thought of Li Jinxi and Wang Li. The author did not create anything. In this regard, the "Grammar Lectures" serialized in "Chinese Language" and the "Modern Chinese Grammar" by Lu Zongda and Yu Min are worth noting for their unique approaches. Recently, Mr. Gao Mingkai denied the classification of word classes, but he has not yet put forward a new system under this premise. As I have said, I cannot add a word of praise in this regard. However, because I am engaged in language work, I often come into contact with teachers and editors. When we talk to each other, we cannot help but complain that the inconsistencies in systems and the divergences in terminology are a great trouble. If a teacher adopts System A for teaching, and students ask questions using System B, what should be done? In the same school, the teachers of one class adopt System A for teaching, and the teachers of another class adopt System B for teaching. All other subjects have fixed teaching materials, but grammar is not like that. What should be done? When editing textbooks, we cannot list the theories of various schools and let students consider them themselves, nor can we integrate the theories of various schools into one theory. What should be done? It is certainly not appropriate to use coercive means to "fix on one," and it is also impossible in reality, but can we fully negotiate and first propose an outline that can be tried out in teaching? Some people are disgusted with the debates of grammarians, thinking that they are debating their own issues and have nothing to do with everyone else. I don't think so. Truth should become clearer the more it is debated. The object of the grammarians' debate is precisely the problem of language, which is the most important tool for all of us. We must look at it from various angles, and then we can see it completely. After seeing it completely, perhaps various statements have some parts that are right and some parts that are wrong. But which part is right and which part is wrong must be discussed. I very much hope that "learning" and "thinking" are given equal importance, investigating and researching on the one hand, and earnestly debating on the other hand, so that results can be achieved as soon as possible.

    从“语法修辞讲话”谈起
    叶圣陶
    近来“中国语文”上有好些篇文章讨论汉语文法的问题，尤其是词类的问题。我是外行，不能赞一辞。我想谈谈另一方面。
    语言文字的事儿，大概可以分两方面来谈。一是语言本身有什么规律，怎么使用就恰当，不那么使用就不恰当，简单的说，就是实际使用上的是非得失。另一方面是怎么理解这些个规律，这是科学理论，这里头大有文章可做。“中国语文”上撰稿的诸位先生谈的是后一方面，我要谈的是前一方面。我想从“语法修辞讲话”谈起。
    “语法修辞讲话”从一九五一年六月六日起登在“人民日报”上，每星期登两回，连续了好几个月才把六讲登完。当时要吕叔湘、朱德熙两位先生写这个“讲话”，为的是大家觉得语言使用上有些混乱。你也说混乱，我也说混乱，到底怎么样才可以消除混乱现象呢？怎么样才可以使咱们的语言纯洁和健康呢？这就有在语言的实际使用上讨究一番的必要。“讲话”登在“人民日报”上，后来又印成单行本，读者那么多，不但读过看过而已，好些个单位还组织学习，拿它做学习资料。反映是多种多样。有的说它着实解决些语言的实际使用上的问题。有的说它头绪纷繁，徒乱人意。有的坚持学习，直到最后一讲，说不看全貌，得不着好处就不能怪人家。有的半途而废，实在学不下去了，说语法那么罗嗦，还是照平时习惯说话写文章吧……再说自从这个“讲话”登出以后，群众中间普遍的有了个认识，就是语法很关重要，即使是嫌语法那么罗嗦的，也认识到现在有那么多的人在看重语法。这是“讲话”登在“人民日报”上的影响。可是评论“讲话”的文章不多见，就其中个别论点来评论的还有过一些，通评全部的似乎更少。“人民日报”编者在开始登“讲话”的时候写过按语，说如有不同的见解尽可以提出来讨论，这个按语好像已经估计到会有这样的情形。
    “讲话”跟其他语法书不同。它不仅说明一些名目和格式，不仅就那些名目和格式列举一些例子，还指出一些实际使用上的缺陷，拿那些缺陷来讨论。譬如讲到主语（在第四讲里），不仅说明什么叫主语，还指出有些句子有了主语缺少合式的谓语，有些句子有了谓语缺少合式的主语，有些句子主语谓语配合不恰当，有些句子主语重复了，有些句子暗中更换了主语了，诸如此类。这个办法是好的，它使“讲话”具有现实的意义，即使一部分讨论还有可以商量的地方，可是不用商量的大部分对人家很有帮助。
    第五讲讲修辞，作者声明把重点放在“明确”上，其次是“简洁”。这就是说，这里讲的是消极修辞方面的事儿，至于怎么样可以使形式更好，用怎么样的形式表达内容可以收到更大的效果，那些个属于积极修辞方面的事儿，暂时不去讨论。大约作者是这么想的：在一般情况下，应该先求“无过”，在“无过”的基础上，再从容的进求“有功”。这一部分指出的语言使用的好些现象，咱们不留心，也不觉得怎么样不妥当，一经作者说破，才觉得确然有些毛病。
    第六讲讲使用标点，着重在辨析疑难。
    就全部看，觉得第四、第五两讲写得较好，第二讲较差。第二讲讲用词，这里头可以商量的地方恐怕最多。第三讲讲虚字，那里头可以商量的地方也不少，例如“有些、有的”“为……而……”“致以”。按现在的情况，作者所批评的某些用法正是大家乐于使用的，而且觉得用得还顺适，可见作者的讲法不见得全正确。
    好些读者的意见，“讲话”的要求似乎苛一点儿，这也不对，那也不合，说话写文章原是挺平常的事儿，哪里会那样的触处荆棘？尤其是初学写文章的人，要是拿“讲话”做学习资料，极容易犯束手束脚的毛病，那就“非徒无益而又害之”。我想，“讲话”的写作既然为了支持“人民日报”社论“正确地使用祖国的语言，为语言的纯洁和健康而斗争！”的号召，搜罗一些不纯洁、不健康的例子来讨论是必要的。实际上各类例子有那么多，咱们就不能怪作者搜罗得太多了——固然有些例子到底纯洁不纯洁、健康不健康还可以商量。可是，假如适当的增多一些正面的（纯洁的、健康的）例子，减少一些不常见的反面的例子，那就叫人家可以多所取法，又可以省去不必要的揣摩，效果该会好些。
    此外还可以指出两点，该是“讲话”的缺点。这里头只讲到句，没谈段落和篇章。一般语法书原来大都如此。可是“讲话”既然把语法和修辞合起来谈，既然着重在讨论语言的使用，这就离不了思维的条理，而思维的条理常常在成段成篇的时候看出来。上下两句分开来看都完整，连起来看可不相应，那就说不上恰当的使用语言。前后两段分开来看都要得，连起来看可搭不上，那也说不上恰当的使用语言。因此，要给读者更多的帮助，应该在下一句和上一句、后一段和前一段的关系上有所讨论。可惜“讲话”没这样做。其次，看现在的情况，长句的应用越来越广，而长句极容易出毛病。为读者着想，应该用较多的篇幅谈长句，“讲话”谈得太少了。第四讲第九段指出各种结构上的毛病，这是有用处的，可是正面的长句只在第一讲的末了儿分析了三句，那是不够的。
    “讲话”注重在语言的实际使用上的是非得失，既然谈是非得失，就得有所取舍。下判断，定取舍，人人的意见不会全同，不同就得讨论。当时“人民日报”的按语希望大家讨论，我也一直在盼望大家讨论，因为语言是交流思想的工具，该怎么样使用才合适，是咱们切身的事儿。注重在语言的实际使用上，实在就是讨论文学语言（“文学语言”这个术语跟咱们古来所谓“雅言”相近，就是大家通晓的、了无隔阂的语言，可以用来谈话、演说、作报告，也可以用来写普通文章和文艺作品）规范化的问题，虽然“讲话”里没正面提出。再说，大家希望消除语言混乱的现象，反过来说，不就是希望规范化吗？规范化了就不混乱了。规范化了，说东是东，说西是西，出于你的口，入于我的心，一清二楚，不折不扣，这才做到充分的交流。规范化是语言工作里头一项重要的工作，要是在这方面无所作为，好些个事情不容易做，如文字改革、编词典、编课本等等。大家好像还不大关心这个问题。我热切的期望大家关心起来，尤其是语言学家。
    有人认为现在的书面语言是“五花八门，一团混乱。要想给他整理出一套规矩来，并且教给人学会他，真是个劳而无功的事”（陆宗达、俞敏：“现代汉语语法”第十面）。这是一种看法。这种看法认为不能就书面语言来谈书面语言，只能拿口头语言来衡量书面语言，合则留，不合则去。这个话当然也有道理，可是这样说是不是全面，书面语言和口头语言的关系是不是那么单纯，这是值得讨论的。“讲话”的作者也注意到书面语言和口头语言的关系，对于古代成分和外来成分的处理也提出一些意见，但是好像认为基本上是可以在现在的书面语言里整理出一套规矩来的。是不是可以这样做，“讲话”里哪些地方做得好，哪些地方做得不好，都是可以讨论而且应该讨论的。经过讨论，把应该肯定的肯定下来，应该否定的否定掉，然后总结出一些原则原理来，那就大有好处——对于说汉语、写汉语的人都有好处。事情当然不会那样单纯，在析疑辨难的当儿，问题引问题，将会引出许多问题来，连“讲话”里没提出的也都有机会拿出来讨论了。要是咱们认定这么一个前提，规范化是必要的而且可能的，讨论就不嫌其广，不嫌其繁。
    附带说一点。既然讲语法，就少不了体系术语。我看“讲话”所用的体系术语是折衷诸家之说，更确切一点儿说，是在黎（锦熙）、王（力）两家之间，作者并没有什么创立。在这方面，异军突起可以注意的有“中国语文”上连载的“语法讲话”和陆宗达、俞敏两位先生的“现代汉语语法”。最近有高名凯先生否认词类分别，不过他还没在这个前提下提出新的体系来。我已经说过，我在这方面不能赞一辞。但是，由于从事语文工作，我常常跟教师、编辑同志接触，彼此一谈起来，就不免诉说，体系不一，术语分歧，大是苦事。教师采用甲的体系讲授，学生提出乙的体系来问难，怎么办？同一学校里，一班的教师采用甲的体系讲授，另一班的教师采用乙的体系讲授，旁的功课都有固定的教材，惟有语法不然，怎么办？编辑课本，既不能罗列诸家之说让学生自己去斟酌，又没法糅合诸家之说成为一说，怎么办？用强迫命令的手段“定于一”，固然不应该，事实上也办不到，但是能不能充分协商，先提出个在教学上可以试用的纲领来呢？有些人对于语法学家的争辩起反感，认为他们争他们的，跟大伙儿毫不相干。我倒不那么想。真理应该愈辩而愈明，语法学家争辩的对象正是咱们大伙儿头等重要的工具——语言的问题。必须从各个不同的角度看，然后看得全，看全之后，也许各种说法都有一部分对，一部分不对。但是哪一部分对，哪一部分不对，就非讨论不可。很希望“学”和“思”并重，一面调查研究，一面认真争辩，这样才能够早有结果。
