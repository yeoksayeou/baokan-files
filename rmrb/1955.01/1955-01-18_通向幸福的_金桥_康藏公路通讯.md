The "Golden Bridge" to Happiness
——Correspondence from the Kangzang Highway
Guo Xinke

The Tibetan people call the Kangzang Highway the "Golden Bridge," and the Kangzang Highway has indeed opened a road for the Tibetan people towards a happy life.

For thousands of years, towering mountains and rushing rivers have hindered the connection between Tibet and the interior of the motherland, and also severed the channels within the Kangzang Plateau. It was difficult to transport the things the Tibetan people needed, and it was difficult to transport the local products and specialties of Kangzang out. In areas such as Bomi, people not only had to climb snow-capped mountains to transport goods, but also had to carry heavy objects across single-plank bridges and use rope slides. Many Tibetan compatriots recalled the situation before liberation, saying: "At that time, who would be willing to waste effort digging fritillary bulbs? They were as cheap as firewood." Even a few strings of worthless foreign beads could be exchanged for several valuable animal skins or a large pile of cordyceps and anemarrhena.

After the construction of the Kangzang Highway, the highway advanced section by section, and thousands of vehicles traveled endlessly on the road. Beautiful buses also traveled back and forth on the tops of Erlang Mountain and Zheduo Mountain. Since mid-May of last year, the convoys of state-owned transportation companies alone, which had the fewest vehicles, have transported several thousand tons of general merchandise, grain, tea, agricultural tools, construction materials, timber, and local products. In just one month, more than 200 tons of goods were transported from Qamdo to Bomi. The state-owned transportation company is now planning to run a bus between Qamdo and Lhasa every six to ten days.

An ordinary truck can transport as much as sixty or seventy yaks, and it is ten times faster and cheaper, which gradually reduces the price of tea, salt, and industrial products transported from the interior of the motherland. In areas such as Qamdo and Bomi, the prices of tea, salt, and industrial products have been reduced by about one-half. Thanks to the support of the People's Government, the prices of various local specialties have also increased separately. This has greatly increased the enthusiasm of the Tibetan people for production, and the output of local specialties has continued to increase. Take Jiangda Zong as an example. In the past, many places in the entire Zong had been closed to the mountains for more than ten years, but last year the mountains were opened everywhere. Only thirty or forty catties of cordyceps were purchased the year before last, but last year more than a thousand catties were purchased before the local product season. The people's purchasing power is therefore increasing day by day. In the past, Jiangda Zong only sold 2,000 packages of tea per year, but last year 12,000 packages were not enough to sell; in the past, the red cloth that Tibetans loved could only sell 50 bolts per year, but last year 50 bolts were sold out in four weeks; the sales volume of cloth and silk exceeded the annual plan by more than twice in less than a year; the year before last, less than ten dozen flashlights were sold, but last year more than one hundred dozen were sold in more than eight months. In Qamdo, you can buy goods from all over the country, eat rice and flour from Sichuan and Xikang, buy red paint from Bomi, Tibetan felt from Gyangze and Lhasa, Tibetan incense from Lhasa, apples from Batang, and apricots and pears from the Nujiang River. The sales volume of various goods in Qamdo has greatly increased compared with before the opening of the Kangzang Highway. The average daily turnover of Qamdo stores was only one to two million yuan before the opening of the Kangzang Highway, but now it has increased to seventy to eighty million yuan. The turnover in 1953 was more than four times that of 1952, and in the first eight months of 1954, it was 172% of the same period in 1953. After the opening of the highway, the Qamdo People's United Store, which was funded by people from all walks of life, has also developed considerably. Tibetan manager Awang Baton said: "With the strong support of the state-owned trade company, the People's United Store assists the state-owned trade company in supplying a large number of daily necessities to the Tibetan people. In the ten months after the opening of the highway, the sales volume of tea, ghee, and highland barley increased by more than double compared with the entire year of 1952. The capital has also increased from 300 million yuan to more than 4 billion yuan."

After the highway was opened, a group of transportation forces were freed up to transfer to the vast rural and pastoral areas on both sides of the highway. Many places that had never been visited by merchants in the past saw mobile teams organized by trading companies. The Tibetan people in these places said happily: "In the past, you couldn't buy things even if you had money, but now you can buy whatever you want."

Automobiles have also brought a large number of iron farm tools, replacing the extremely backward wooden farm tools of the past. Last year, in addition to distributing agricultural and pastoral tools worth 1.5 billion yuan free of charge in the Qamdo area, state-owned trade organizations and other stores also supplied farmers and herdsmen with a large number of iron plows, axes, sickles, hoes, medicinal hoes, wool shears, and other tools. The Qamdo People's United Store sold 250,000 catties of iron farm tools in eight months last year. The iron ore mined on the Kangzang Plateau has begun to be transported along the highway to steel factories in Chongqing.

On the Kangzang Highway, we can see new buildings, new settlements, and new towns at any time. More than 100,000 square meters of houses have been built along the highway west of Ganzi alone.

In the past, it was difficult to find the place named Zhamu on the map. This place was still a vast grassland last summer. By the end of August, rows of neat houses began to appear here. Now it has become a famous emerging town. Tibetan Dengbi said in surprise: "I didn't expect that there would be so many beautiful houses with electric lights all of a sudden. I also watched two movies here, and I was really indescribably happy." In this new town, which is 2,700 meters above sea level, cars often come and go during the day, and the lights shine in all directions at night, illuminating the dark sky. The construction plan for the new city of Zhamu, including the auditorium, office building, dormitory, bathroom, generator room, club, hospital, pharmacy, warehouse, and parking lot, has been largely completed. There are already postal and telecommunications, banking, and other institutions here, and there will be trade and other institutions. There is also a temporary market by the river, where one or twenty Tibetan and Han merchants operate. There is also a pleasant cultural life here. You can watch ball games, movies, Sichuan opera, and new books and newspapers. You can also take a walk on the tree-lined avenue, take a boat to the beautiful Sangdun, or attend a dance party.

Another new town, Jiangda, is composed of yellow, red, and silver-gray new buildings. There is already a post and telecommunications bureau, a trade group, a health center, an animal epidemic prevention station, and a accommodation station here. A small hydroelectric generator brings light at night. The Gangtu ferry of Jiangda Zong has also established banking, trade, postal and telecommunications, automobile transportation, traffic management, and other institutions. The sound of engines echoes at the ferry all day long, and ferries come and go continuously.

Some new buildings have also appeared on the beautiful plateau lake, Lake Ancuo.

In Qamdo, the urban appearance is changing even faster. Automobile repair factories, wood processing factories, brick and tile factories, lime factories, and thermal power plants have been established one after another. The number of citizens in Qamdo has more than doubled compared with before liberation. Among them, the number of merchants has increased by more than seven times, and the capital has increased by five times; the number of handicraft households has also increased by about two times. The streets are crowded with farmers, herdsmen, and merchants from all directions. In the past, there were only small stalls selling cigarettes, soap, and bracelets here, but now there are shops in various industries. The People's United Store is building a large building on Xingfu West Road, which has three outlets for general merchandise, food, and local products, as well as offices, warehouses, and an auditorium. By August of last year, citizens had newly built more than 140 new houses, and more than 30 other citizens had requested to build new houses. Two residents of Qichi Street, who could not even afford to eat in the past, are now building new houses. Twenty-three foreign residents have formed a new street called Shangjiangka Street. Sichuan Dam, which used to have no households, is now crowded with various buildings. On Yunnan Dam, which has 500,000 square meters, a new urban area construction plan has been gradually formulated and implemented. There will be a 16-meter-wide tree-lined avenue, a square that can accommodate more than 10,000 people, a beautiful riverside park, a railway station, and a waterworks. The dilapidated city of Qamdo, which was once called a beggar, a bedbug, and full of venereal diseases, is gradually changing.

The highway has also brought a new cultural life to the Tibetan people. Last year, two film projection teams screened more than 100 films for Tibetan people, workers, local staff, and troops along the 1,000-kilometer highway from the western border of Bomi to Manigange. Automobiles have also brought a large number of books and newspapers. In the seventeen months after the opening of the highway in Qamdo, the Xinhua Bookstore sold Tibetan and Chinese books and periodicals worth 1.4 billion yuan. Images of Mao Zedong and Stalin with Tibetan explanations were warmly welcomed by the Tibetan people. The Xinhua Bookstore also organized mobile book sales teams to meet the cultural needs of the Tibetan people.

Automobiles have also brought medical and health equipment and medicines. The Qamdo People's Hospital has been expanded. At the beginning of last year, six Zongs in the Qamdo area established health centers and clinics. Among them, the health center in Jiangda Zong, which is located on the highway, is relatively well-equipped. In five months, the outpatient clinic and the mobile medical team that went to the rural and pastoral areas have treated more than 5,000 patients. Near Songzong in Bomi, four Tibetan patients suffering from serious chronic diseases were cured after taking a car to the Qamdo People's Hospital.

In the united and friendly family of all ethnic groups in our motherland, the face of the Kangzang Plateau has begun to change. The opening of the Kangzang Highway has filled the Tibetan people with confidence in building a happy life. Many Tibetan compatriots say: "We are like withered grass. The Communist Party came and sprinkled sweet dew on us, and we have turned green and blossomed."

    通向幸福的“金桥”
    ——康藏公路通讯
    郭辛可
    藏族人民把康藏公路叫做“金桥”，康藏公路也确实为藏族人民开辟了走向幸福生活的道路。
    千百年来，崇山激流障碍着西藏和祖国内地的往来，也割裂了康藏高原内部的通道。藏族人民需要的东西很难运进去，康藏的土产和特产很难运出来。在波密等地区，人们运输东西，不仅要爬雪山，而且要背重物走独木桥，过溜索。许多藏胞回忆起解放前的情形说：“那时谁愿白费力气去挖贝母？它和柴火一样便宜。”甚至几串不值钱的外来的小珠，就可以换到好几张珍贵的兽皮或一大堆虫草、知母。
    康藏公路修筑后，公路节节前进，成千成百辆汽车不绝地行驶在公路上，漂亮的公共汽车也往返在二郎山、折多山顶了。自从去年五月中旬以来，仅车数最少的国营运输公司车队就运送了好几千吨百货、粮食、茶叶、农具、建筑器材、木材和土特产。仅在一个月里，由昌都运往波密的货物就有二百多吨。现在，国营运输公司正计划六天至十天开一次昌都到拉萨的班车。
    一辆普通的载重汽车能顶六、七十头牦牛运东西，速度快十倍，运价又便宜，这就使从祖国内地运来的茶、盐和工业品的价格逐步降低。在昌都和波密等区茶盐和工业品的价格降低了二分之一左右。由于人民政府的扶植，各种土特产的价格也分别提高了。这就使藏族人民的生产积极性大大提高，土特产的产量不断增加。就拿江达宗来说，过去全宗许多地方已封山十多年，去年到处开山。前年只收购了三、四十斤虫草，去年还没有到土产季节，就收购了一千多斤。人民的购买力因而日益增长。江达宗过去每年只销二千包茶叶，去年一万二千包还不够销；过去藏民喜爱的红布全年只能销五十匹，去年四个星期就销完五十匹；布匹和绸缎的销售量不到一年就超过了全年计划的二倍；前年手电筒还销不到十打，去年八个多月就售出一百多打。在昌都，你可以买到全国各地的货物，吃到四川、西康的大米和面粉，买到波密的红颜料，江孜和拉萨等地的藏毡，拉萨的藏香，巴塘的苹果，怒江边上的杏和梨子。昌都各种货物的销售量，都比康藏公路通车前大为增加，昌都商店在康藏公路通车前平均每天的营业额只有一、二百万元，现在增加到七、八千万元。一九五三年的营业金额相当于一九五二年的四倍多，一九五四年八个月中，又相当于一九五三年同期的百分之一百七十二。在公路通车后，由各阶层人民集资组成的昌都人民联合商店也得到了相当的发展。藏族经理阿旺巴顿说：“在国营贸易公司的大力扶助下，人民联合商店辅助国营贸易公司向藏族人民大量供应生活必需品。在通车后的十个月内，茶、酥油、青稞等销售量即比一九五二年全年增加一倍。资金也由三亿元增加到四十多亿元。”
    公路通车后，腾出一批运输力转入公路两侧的广大农村、牧区去，许多过去从来没有商人去的地方，出现了贸易公司组织的流动小组。这些地方的藏族人民高兴地说：“过去有钱买不到东西，现在要买啥有啥。”
    汽车也带来了大批铁制农具，代替了过去极其落后的木农具。去年昌都地区除了无偿发放价值十五亿元的农、牧用具外，国营贸易机构和其他商店还供给农、牧民大批铁犁、斧头、镰刀、锄头、挖药锄、羊毛剪等工具。昌都人民联合商店在去年八个月里即已售出二十五万斤铁农具。康藏高原上开采出来的铁矿已开始沿着公路线运到重庆的钢铁工厂去。
    在康藏公路上，我们随时可以看到新的建筑，新的居民点和新的城镇。仅甘孜以西的公路沿线，就修建了十多万平方公尺的房屋。
    过去，在地图上很难找到扎木这个地方。去年夏天这儿还是一片空旷的草地，到八月下旬，这里就开始出现了一排排整齐的房屋。现在它已经成为一个著名的新兴市镇。藏民邓壁惊讶地说：“想不到一下就有了这么多又漂亮、又有电灯的房子，我还在这儿看了两次电影，实在是说不出的高兴。”在这拔海二千七百公尺的新城镇里，白天常有汽车来往，夜晚灯光四射，照亮了黑暗的天空。扎木新城的包括大礼堂、办公楼、宿舍、浴室、电机房、俱乐部、医院、医药库、仓库、停车场等建筑物的建设计划，已经大部完成了。这里已经有了邮电、银行等机构，并将有贸易和其他机构。在河边还有一个临时市场，一、二十户藏、汉商人在这儿营业。这儿也有愉快的文化生活，可以看到球赛、电影、川剧和新书报，也可以在林荫大道上散步，坐船到风景幽美的桑顿去玩，或者去参加舞会。
    另一个新的市镇——江达，是由黄色、红色和银灰色的新建筑物组成的。这儿已有了邮电局、贸易组、卫生院、兽疫防治站和食宿站。夜晚一部小型水力发电机送来了光明。江达宗所属的冈拖渡口，也设立了银行、贸易、邮电、汽车运输、交通管理和其他机构。渡口上整日响着引擎声，渡船来往不绝。
  美丽的高原湖泊——安错湖畔，也出现了一些新的建筑。
    在昌都，城市面貌改变更快。汽车修理厂、木材加工厂、砖瓦厂、石灰厂和火力发电厂先后建立起来。昌都市民已比解放前增加了一倍以上。其中商户增加了七倍以上，资金增加了五倍；手工业户也增加了二倍左右。街道上挤满了来自四面八方的农民、牧民和商人。过去这儿只有些出售香烟、肥皂和镯子的小摊子，现在这儿有了各种行业的商店。人民联合商店正在幸福西路修建一座大楼，它有百货、食品、土产三个门市部及办公室、仓库和礼堂。到去年八月止，市民已新修了一百四十多间新房子，另有三十多户市民请求修建新屋。齐齿街的两户居民，过去连饭也吃不上，现在动手修新房子了。二十三户外来的居民组成了一条新街道——上江卡街。过去没有人户的四川坝现在挤满了各种建筑物。在有五十万平方公尺的云南坝上，一个新市区建设计划已逐步开始制订和实现了。这儿将有十六公尺宽的林荫大道、可容一万多人的广场、美丽的河滨公园、车站和自来水厂。过去被人们称为乞丐、臭虫、花柳病等五多的破烂的昌都城，正在逐步地改变。
    公路也给藏民带来了新的文化生活。去年，有两支电影放映队，在从波密西境到马尼干果一千公里长的公路线上，给沿途藏民、工人、地方工作人员和部队放映了一百多场电影。汽车又运来大批书报。昌都在通车后的十七个月里，新华书店即已售出价值十四亿元的藏、汉文书刊。有藏文说明的毛泽东和斯大林像受到藏民热烈的欢迎。新华书店并组织流动售书组，以适应藏族人民文化生活的需要。
    汽车也带来了医药卫生设备和药品。昌都人民医院扩大了。去年年初，昌都地区有六个宗设立了卫生院、所。其中设立在公路线上的江达宗的卫生院设备比较完善，在五个月里，门诊所和到农村、牧区去的巡回医疗小组，已治疗了五千多个病人。波密松宗附近还有四个患严重慢性病的藏族病人，坐汽车到昌都人民医院治好了病。
    在我们祖国各民族团结友好的大家庭里，康藏高原的面貌开始改变了，康藏公路的通车，更使藏族人民充满了建设幸福生活的信心。许多藏胞都这样说：“我们像枯黄的小草，共产党来了给我们洒上甘露，又发青和开花了。”
