The "Comprehensive No. 1 Seedling Lifting Plow" has been successfully manufactured by the Forestry Bureau of the Liaoning Provincial People's Government. It has been tested repeatedly for four months and the results are good.

Liaoning Province has a large area for afforestation, and a large number of seedlings are needed every year. However, in the past, seedlings were lifted manually, which resulted in low work efficiency and a high rate of seedling damage. Especially in the autumn, farmers are busy with the autumn harvest, and the labor force for lifting seedlings is reduced, which often affects the completion of afforestation tasks. The successful creation of the "Comprehensive No. 1 Seedling Lifting Plow" has greatly improved the efficiency of seedling lifting. One work team (pulled by four to six horses, operated by two to four people) can dig 4,000 to 9,000 square meters of seedlings per day, which is two to five times more efficient than using a large hoe manually; the average seedling damage rate is only 0.2%; and the operation is easy. Now, 21 Comprehensive No. 1 Seedling Lifting Plows have been tested and promoted in sixteen counties throughout the province.

    “综合号起苗犁”制造成功
    辽宁省人民政府林业局制造“综合号起苗犁”成功，经过四个月的多次试验，效果良好。
    辽宁省造林面积较广，每年需要大批苗木，但过去起苗都是用人工，工作效率低，伤苗率大，特别是秋季，农民忙于秋收，起苗劳动力减少，往往影响造林任务的完成。“综合号起苗犁”创造成功，大大提高了起苗效率。一工组（四——六马牵引，二——四人操作赶套）一日掘苗达四千到九千平方公尺，比人工用大镐提高效率二倍到五倍；伤苗率平均仅千分之二；操作容易。现在全省已在十六个县试验推广了综合号起苗犁二十一台。
