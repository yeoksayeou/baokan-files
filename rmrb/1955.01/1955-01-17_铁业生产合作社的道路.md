    The Road of the Iron Industry Production Cooperative
    By our reporter, Miao Feng

    The Shandi Iron Industry Production Cooperative is located in a small mountain gully in the northwest of Yangquan, Shanxi Province. The road it has travelled vividly illustrates that only by organizing themselves and taking the path of collectivization can handicraft workers escape backwardness and poverty.

    I

    Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the iron goods produced by the handicraft industry in Shandi Village were once widely sold in Henan, Hebei, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces. However, the lives of those who produced these iron goods were extremely miserable. At that time, the earthen furnaces and "ox-dung bellows" were controlled by landlords and merchants. The ox-dung bellows was a heavy and cumbersome tool for fanning the fire. Even a strong young man would sweat profusely and be exhausted after fanning for only half an hour. Despite such arduous labor, they could only earn a liter of rice a day.

    The elms and locust trees around Shandi Village never had lush foliage, because as soon as the branches sprouted, they were stripped bare by the villagers to mix with bran and make a gruel to survive.

    Under the devastation of the Japanese invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek/Yan Xishan bandit gangs, by the time Yangquan was liberated in 1947, not a single earthen furnace in Shandi Village could be put into operation.

    II

    In order to help the masses restore iron production, the Party and the People's Government, even in those difficult years of the Liberation War, loaned Shandi Village more than 20,000 jin of millet. Under the initiative of Communist Party members Yang Zhendong, Wang Dianhua, and others, more than sixty iron smelting workers in Shandi Village organized six earthen furnaces in the form of labor shares and started production separately. Each person received a daily wage of three jin of millet. After four months of production, each share had a surplus of more than 300 jin of millet. On this basis, they continuously improved their tools, increased production, reduced costs, and initially improved their living standards. However, at that time, due to a lack of organizational leadership and production management experience, and especially a failure to educate the handicraft workers in collectivism and the future, the long-standing employment mentality of the workers was not transformed. What is more, the idea of "rough twist big lamp head, burning everybody's oil" grew, resulting in a lack of accurate accounting of raw materials during production and great waste. After settling accounts at the end of the year, they lost a lot of money, and there were many complaints. Many people withdrew their shares and tools.

    However, the Communist Party members and some of the more progressive workers among them did not advocate disbanding. They said, "Organizing ourselves is the bright road pointed out by the Communist Party. Without organization, we wouldn't even have today's life! If there are problems in production, we can all study and solve them." This group of people, with the support and assistance of the village supply and marketing cooperative, reorganized and expanded their scale, established the Shandi Iron Industry Production Cooperative, and continued production.

    III

    When the cooperative started production, the first problem it encountered was the raw materials.

    In the past, the raw materials used for production were entirely scrap pig iron purchased from the market. The broken pots and pans that people had accumulated during the war were becoming increasingly scarce. The problem was clear: if the raw material problem could not be solved, it would be difficult for the cooperative to consolidate.

    Wang Dianhua, the deputy director of the production cooperative (he is a Communist Party member), thought with great sadness: Shandi Village lies in a mineral deposit, but it cannot solve the raw material problem. Should they continue to use earthen furnaces to smelt "men tie" (smothered iron ore)? That would be a step backward. He suddenly thought of using a round furnace to smelt "men tie". He told everyone about his plan, but not many people supported him. Older people said, "More than thirty years ago, someone tried to use a round furnace to smelt 'men tie', but it didn't work. Why walk the path where others have stumbled?" Some people said, "If you're not sure, don't do it. Our little nest egg can't afford the risk."

    Wang Dianhua thought: Did others stumble because there were thorns, or because they didn't know how to walk? But when he thought about the "nest egg not being able to afford the risk," he hesitated again. So he went to the Party branch committee for discussion. Encouraged and supported by the Party branch, he united with technical workers Chen Fuliang, Shi Wanzhong, and others to start experimenting with round furnace "men tie". They guarded the round furnace that was spewing flames, their hearts pounding like rabbits. In the afternoon, iron flowed out of the round furnace at last. But it was lumpy and could not be cast into iron goods. Although some people said, "In Shandi, the sky you see is still just the size of the well opening," the fact that the round furnace could melt iron gave Wang Dianhua infinite confidence.

    Why was the quality of the smelted iron poor? They finally found the answer on the twenty-third day of the experiment: it turned out that the tuyeres were too thin and straight to maximize the furnace heat. They immediately thickened the original tuyeres. That afternoon, high-quality iron flowed out of the round furnace, with an iron output rate of 70 percent. At this time, even the members who had been gossiping looked at Wang Dianhua with admiration and joy, and no one said that the sky in Shandi would always be as small as the well opening.

    As production continued to develop and machines gradually replaced manual labor, solving the problems of production management and labor organization became the most pressing issues.

    In the past, a furnace had more than a dozen workers, and it didn't matter much if the workers arrived at different times. But it was different when machines were installed. Once the machine was turned on, workers responsible for different production processes were required to work simultaneously. However, it was extremely difficult to ask the members to gather together as soon as they heard a whistle. Today you are late, tomorrow he is late, and those who come early wait for those who come late, and after a few days, those who came early no longer come early. As a result, work often could not begin until the sun was high in the sky. At this time, the cadres of the Iron Industry Cooperative first divided the work, assigned members to groups according to the production process, fixed the workers for each furnace, and designated someone to be responsible, requiring that leave be requested the day before if necessary. However, the absenteeism rate did not decrease after this rectification. Some members said, "Machines are good, but they restrain people too much. It's not as free as working with earthen furnaces." Others said, "I'm not in difficulty now, and I can afford to rest for three or five days."

    Based on the members' thinking, the Party branch first conducted education in collectivism and exemplary action among the Party members, and assigned tasks: one Party member uniting and leading several members. Through the Party members, the entire membership was educated on the cooperative's charter and collectivism. By comparing the old and new societies, the old and new production methods, and the old and new lives, the members realized that the cooperative was their home. Whether production was good or bad, they had a share in it. If they were absent from work, it would affect the collective, and affecting the collective would affect them.

    After the rectification and education, the members could arrive at work and leave work on time. From the outside, production seemed very orderly, but the scrap rate was very high in terms of production results. After research, it was discovered that the wage system was unreasonable. In response to this situation, the cooperative established a product inspection system and reflected it in wages: a good jin of iron earned a wage of forty yuan, while scrap iron was uniformly thirty yuan. As a result, everyone became concerned about quality, and the scrap rate quickly dropped from 40 to 50 percent to about 10 percent.

    It was in this way that the Shandi Iron Industry Production Cooperative overcame many difficulties and continuously consolidated and developed itself through organizational leadership and ideological education. In particular, after the publicity of the General Line and the study of the cooperative's charter, the members' awareness was greatly improved. Now, as long as the cooperative proposes measures related to the development of the cooperative, no member disagrees. Last October, in order to meet the needs of the country, the cooperative changed to smelting gray pig iron, and equipment needed to be installed on a larger scale. In addition to a portion of the loan provided by the National Bank, the members unanimously proposed to contribute two months' wages as shares in the cooperative.

    Collective labor has already fostered a deep affection between the members and the Iron Industry Cooperative. Member Zhang Wangsuo became ill from overwork. The cooperative advised him to rest, but he refused, insisting on taking on the task of patrolling at night.

    IV

    On the basis of actively developing production, the members of the Shandi Iron Industry Production Cooperative have greatly improved their material and cultural lives.

    The people of Shandi no longer eat tree leaves and bran. In the past, the people of Shandi ate white flour at most twice a year: once on the first day of the Lunar New Year and once on the Mid-Autumn Festival. Now, the supply and marketing cooperative provides more than 8,000 jin of white flour, more than 2,000 jin of rice, and more than 2,000 jin of bean flour per month according to the national plan. In every member's home, you can see brightly colored new bedding piled up halfway to the ceiling.

    In order to meet the members' cultural and welfare needs, the Shandi Iron Industry Production Cooperative has established basketball courts, clinics, barbershops, bathhouses, and other facilities. After work every day, the members can wash away the dirt and grease from their bodies. Zhang Dingcheng, an old member in his sixties, muttered as he washed in the steaming pond, "If Chairman Mao hadn't guided us to organize ourselves, I would have taken this lifetime's worth of dirt to the grave."

    铁业生产合作社的道路
    本报记者  苗风
    山底铁业生产合作社在山西省阳泉西北的一个小山沟里。它走过的道路真切地说明：手工业劳动者只有组织起来，走合作化的道路，才能摆脱落后和贫困。
    一
    抗日战争以前山底村手工业生产的铁货曾经盛销河南、河北、陕西、甘肃等省。但是，生产这些铁货的人的生活却是极端悲惨的。那时土炉和“牛屎?”掌握在地主兼商人的手里。牛屎?是一种笨重的扇风工具，哪怕是身体很强壮的小伙子，扇不了半柱香的工夫就会像从河里爬出来一样，混身淌汗，精疲力尽。就是这样繁重的劳动，还要起五更睡半夜才能赚到一升米。
    山底村周围的榆树、槐树没有叶茂成荫过，在树枝刚发芽的时候，就被村里人采光搅糠餬口了。
    在日寇和蒋阎匪帮的摧残下，到一九四七年阳泉解放时，山底村的土炉连一座也不能开工了。
    二
    党和人民政府为了帮助群众恢复铁业生产，在进行解放战争那样困难的年代里，还贷给山底村两万多斤小米。在共产党员杨震山、王殿华等发起下，山底村的六十多个炼铁工人用劳力合股的形式，组织起六座土炉来，分头生产。每人每日三斤小米的工资。生产四个月，每股就盈余三百多斤米。他们在这个基础上不断地改进工具，提高了生产、降低了成本，并且初步改善了生活。但是，当时由于缺乏组织领导和生产管理的经验，特别是不善于对手工业者进行集体主义和前途教育，因而在工人思想中长期存在的雇佣观点没有得到改造，而且滋长了“粗捻大灯头，熬了是大家的油”的思想，生产时原料没有确数，浪费很大。一年后一结账，亏了很多，大家意见纷纷。很多人抽走了股金和工具。
    但是，其中的共产党员和一部分思想较为进步的工人却不主张散伙。他们说：“组织起来是共产党指给咱的光明大道，要不组织起来，就连今天这样的日月也没有呀！生产上有问题咱大伙研究解决。”这部分人终于在本村供销合作社的支持和帮助下，重整旗鼓，扩大了规模；成立了山底铁业生产合作社，继续生产。
    三
    合作社开工生产，首先碰到的是原料问题。
    以前，生产所用的原料完全是在市场上收购的废生铁。人们在战争中积存的破锅烂铧越来越少。问题很明显，不能解决原料问题，合作社就很难巩固。
    生产合作社副主任王殿华（他是共产党员）很难过地想到：山底村躺在矿石窝里，却不能解决原料问题。继续用土炉化闷铁吗？那叫倒退。他忽然想用圆炉化闷铁。他把计划向大家讲了，但支持他的人并不多。年长的人说：“三十多年以前，就有人想用圆炉化闷铁，化不成。别人扎过脚的路，为什么还要去走呢？”有的人说：“没有把握，不要干，咱这点家底踢打不开。”
    王殿华想：别人扎脚，是因为有刺还是因为不会走呢？可是一想到“家底踢打不开”，又动摇了。他就去找党支委会研究。在党支部鼓励和支持下，他团结了技术工人陈福亮、施万中等开始试验圆炉闷铁。他们守着喷着火焰的圆炉，心里像藏了小兔一样，不住地跳。下午，圆炉里终于流出了铁水。但是一团一团的，铸不成铁货。虽然有人说：在山底拨云见天，天还是井口大；但圆炉能化出铁水，却给了王殿华无限信心。
    为什么炼出来的铁质量不好呢？他们终于在进行试验的第二十三天找到了答案：原来是因为风嘴太细太直，不能最大限度地加高炉热。他们马上把原来的风嘴加粗了。就在当天下午，圆炉里流出了质量很好的铁水，出铁率达百分之七十。这时，就连说闲话的社员也都用敬佩和喜悦的眼光来看王殿华，再没有人说山底的天永远是井口那么大了。
    生产不断发展，机器不断代替手工，解决生产管理和劳动组织的问题，就成为最迫切的问题。
    过去，一个炉十几个工人，各炉工人差前差后的上工，影响不大。安上机器却不同了。机器一开，就要求负责各个不同生产过程的工人同时动作。但是要求社员们听到一声气笛就集合起来，千难万难。今天你迟来，明天他迟到，来早的等来迟的，过了几天早来的也不早来了。这样，常常在太阳升起一竿子高的时候，还开不了工。这时，铁业社干部首先分了工，按生产过程把社员编了小组，把各炉工人固定下来，并指定专人负责，有事必须在前一天请假。但是，这样整顿以后缺勤率并没有减少。有的社员说：“机器好是好，就是把人箍得太死，可不如干土炉自由。”还有的说：“我现在不困难，歇三天五天也歇得起。”
    党支部根据社员这种思想，首先在党员中进行了集体主义和模范作用的教育，并进行分工：一个党员团结和带动若干社员。并通过党员，向全体社员进行了一次社章和集体主义的教育。用新旧社会对比，新旧生产对比，新旧生活对比的方法，使社员认识到合作社就是家。生产好坏，有自己一份。自己误工，就影响集体，影响集体，就影响自己。
    整顿和教育后，社员能按时上班下班了。从外表看，生产很有秩序，但从生产结果看，次品率却很高。经过研究，才发现工资制度不合理。针对这一情况，社里又建立了产品检验制度，并用工资表现出来：生产一斤好铁，四十元工资，次铁一律三十元。这一来大家都关心质量了，次品率很快由百分之四五十降低到百分之十左右。
    山底铁业生产合作社就是这样通过组织领导和思想教育，克服了很多困难，不断巩固和发展着。特别是经过总路线宣传和社章学习，社员们的觉悟更大大提高了一步。现在只要社里提出有关发展社的措施，社员没有不同意的。去年十月，为了适应国家的需要，改炼灰生铁，在设备上需要安装规模较大的再造炉，除国家银行给一部分贷款外，社员们一致提出把两个月的工资作股入社。
    集体劳动已经使社员和铁业社发生了深厚的感情。社员张王锁积劳成疾，社里劝他休息，他不愿意，坚持担负了巡夜的工作。
    四
    山底铁业生产合作社的社员们在积极发展生产的基础上，大大改善了自己的物质和文化生活。
    山底人再不吃树叶和糠了。过去山底的人一年顶多吃两顿白面。大年初一吃一顿，八月十五吃一顿。现在供销社每月按国家计划供应的八千多斤白面，两千多斤大米，两千多斤豆面了。走到每个社员家里，都可以看到颜色鲜艳、堆了半墙高的新铺盖。
    山底铁业生产合作社为了满足社员对文化福利的要求，建立了篮球场、诊疗所、理发室、浴室等设备。社员们在每天工作以后，可以痛痛快快地洗去身上的肮脏和油腻。六十多岁的老社员张鼎成在那热气腾腾的池塘里，边洗边念叨：“要不是毛主席指引咱组织起来，我这攒了一辈子的肮脏要带到坟里去了。”（附图片）
    副主任王殿华（炉下左起第三人）和社员们在新建的再造炉下商讨开始生产灰生铁。
