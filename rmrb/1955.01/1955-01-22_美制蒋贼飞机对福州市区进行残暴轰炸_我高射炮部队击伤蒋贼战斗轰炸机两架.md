Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, January 21st: American-made Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes barbarously bombed the people of Fuzhou City on the afternoon of the 20th.

Starting from 3:28 PM on the 20th, six batches of twelve American-made Chiang Kai-shek F-84 fighter-bombers successively intruded into the skies over Fuzhou City, dropping twenty-three bombs, including eight time bombs and two incendiary bombs, on areas such as Cangshan, Taijiang, and Xiaoqiao in the city, including Zhongzhou, Duihu, Paiwei, Zhongxuan, Xiadu, Bangzhou, and the Qian Township of Gaishan District and the Tongpan area of Hongshan District in the suburbs. Civilian houses within the jurisdiction of the Yingbin Residents' Committee in Taijiang District and civilian houses along Da Dao Road in Xiaoqiao District were hit and caught fire. After extensive rescue efforts, the fire was completely extinguished by 3:30 AM on the 21st. According to preliminary investigations, American-made Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes destroyed and burned down more than 4,000 civilian houses, causing more than 300 casualties among residents, including more than 120 deaths and more than 180 injuries. Eight small civilian boats were sunk or destroyed.

When the Chiang bandit planes bombed the urban area, our People's Liberation Army anti-aircraft artillery units immediately launched fierce fire, damaging two Chiang bandit F-84 fighter-bombers.

After Fuzhou City was bombed by American-made Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes, the Fuzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Fuzhou Municipal People's Government immediately jointly organized a temporary headquarters to organize forces from all aspects of the city to rescue and resettle the affected residents, and to lead the city's residents to continue to carry out the struggle against air raids.

The people of Fuzhou City remained exceptionally calm during the Chiang bandit plane bombing. Fire brigades, ambulance teams, and rescue teams dispatched by various hospitals rushed to the bombed areas to rescue injured residents. Farmers from the suburbs also traveled long distances to assist in extinguishing the fire. The Fujian Province and Fuzhou City government agencies, factories, and the People's Liberation Army Public Security Forces and Engineering Corps stationed in Fuzhou City also sent large numbers of personnel to the bombed sites to help residents fight the fire and handle the aftermath. Residents around the bombed areas also promoted the spirit of mutual assistance and friendship, and voluntarily vacated their houses for the affected residents to live in. All injured residents have been rescued and sent to hospitals for treatment. Residents whose houses were destroyed have also been properly resettled.

People from all walks of life in Fuzhou City, witnessing the monstrous crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, were filled with indignation and resolutely expressed that they must continue to strengthen all aspects of their work and fight to the end to liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands and completely smash the US-Chiang war treaty.
