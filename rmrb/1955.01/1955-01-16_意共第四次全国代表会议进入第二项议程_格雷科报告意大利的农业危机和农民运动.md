Xinhua News Agency, Rome, January 15th: The Italian Communist Party's Fourth National Congress, which began on the 9th, continues. On the 10th, 11th, and 12th, the Congress discussed Togliatti's report on "The Struggle of Communists for Freedom, Peace, and Socialism." Speakers in the discussion included Luigi Longo, Deputy General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party; Pietro Secchia; Moro Scoccimarro, Secretary of the Secretariat; some leaders of the Italian Communist Party Central Committee; and heads of many local organizations. They spoke on issues such as intensifying the opposition to monopoly capital, striving for the establishment of a democratic regime, expanding the people's united front, and strengthening the struggle for peace and against the revival of German militarism.

The Congress entered its second agenda item on the 13th. On that day, the Congress heard a report by Ruggiero Greco, a member of the Italian Communist Party Central Committee: "Italy's Agricultural Crisis and the Struggle to Protect Peasant Interests and Win Land Reform."

In his report, Greco analyzed the agricultural crisis in Italy, which has become particularly severe in recent years. He pointed out that last year's agricultural output was 12.6 percent lower than in 1953. Despite this, there is still a surplus of agricultural products in the country.

Greco pointed out that the reason for this situation is the shrinking of domestic and foreign markets and the result of the United States shifting its agricultural crisis under the guise of "aid."

Greco said that farmers are forced to give a quarter of the value of all their agricultural products to the landlords. This is also one of the reasons for the backwardness of the rural economy in Italy. He said that as the agricultural crisis continues to deepen, small and medium-sized farmers are constantly going bankrupt and becoming rural proletarians, and unemployment in rural areas is constantly developing.

Speaking of the "land reform" implemented by the Christian Democratic government, Greco pointed out that farmers must pay a huge sum of 40 billion lire for the more than 500,000 hectares of land they have received, which does not include the high interest rates on installments. In addition, industrial monopoly capital maintains the prices of agricultural tools and fertilizers at a very high level.

Greco emphasized that the political nature of the Italian peasant movement is becoming increasingly obvious, as manifested in their demands for changing the entire agricultural structure, and also in their struggle for freedom and democracy.

Greco then outlined the Party's rural work program. He said, now, we reaffirm that we demand that the amount of land occupied be generally reduced to 100 hectares, and in some areas to 50 hectares. The confiscated land must be distributed to landless and land-poor peasants.

Greco concluded by saying that the Italian Communist Party's struggle for the interests of the peasant masses is an indispensable part of the overall struggle for freedom, peace, and democracy.

    意共第四次全国代表会议进入第二项议程
    格雷科报告意大利的农业危机和农民运动
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社罗马讯：九日开始的意大利共产党第四次全国代表会议继续进行。会议在十日、十一日和十二日讨论了陶里亚蒂所作的关于“共产党员为争取自由、和平和社会主义而斗争”的报告。讨论中发言的有：意大利共产党副总书记路易吉·隆哥、彼特罗·谢嘉，书记处书记莫罗·斯科奇马罗，意大利共产党中央委员会的一些领导人以及许多地方组织的负责人。他们分别谈到了关于加紧反对垄断资本、争取建立民主政权、扩大人民统一战线和加强争取和平、反对复活德国军国主义的斗争等问题。
    会议从十三日起进入了第二项议程。这一天，会议听取了意大利共产党中央委员会委员鲁杰罗·格雷科的报告：“意大利的农业危机和保护农民利益、争取土地改革的斗争”。
    格雷科在报告中分析了意大利国内最近几年来发展得特别严重的农业危机。他指出，去年的农业产量比一九五三年降低了百分之十二点六。尽管如此，国内农产品还是过剩。
    格雷科指出，造成这种情况的原因是由于国内外市场的缩小和美国在“援助”的幌子下转嫁农业危机的结果。
    格雷科说，农民被迫要把他们收入的全部农产品的价值的四分之一交给地主。这也是意大利农村经济落后的原因之一。他说，随着农业危机的继续加深，小农和中农不断破产成为农村的无产者，农村的失业现象正在不断发展。
    格雷科在谈到天主教民主党政府所实行的“土地改革”时指出，农民必须为他们所得到的五十多万公顷土地付出四百亿里拉的巨款，这还没有把分期付款的很高的利息计算在内。除此以外，工业垄断资本还把农具和肥料的价格维持在很高的水平上。
    格雷科着重指出，意大利农民运动的政治性质越来越明显了，这表现在他们关于改变整个农业结构的要求上，也表现在他们争取自由和民主的斗争中。
    格雷科接着概述了党的农村工作纲领。他说，现在，我们重申，我们要求把土地占有数量普遍减少到一百公顷，在某些地区减少到五十公顷。被没收的土地一定要分给无地和少地的农民。
    格雷科最后说，意大利共产党进行的争取农民群众利益的斗争是争取自由、和平和民主的总的斗争中不可缺少的一部分。
