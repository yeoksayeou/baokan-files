    The Central Committee of the Soviet Komsomol Decides to Send 100,000 Young People to Participate in the Construction Industry
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th] TASS Moscow reports: The Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union has made a resolution on the participation of Komsomol organizations in the implementation of the plan proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union regarding the construction of prefabricated reinforced concrete structure and component factories.

    The resolution pointed out: The active participation of Komsomol members and young people in the construction of these factories is a patriotic undertaking of extremely important significance. The Komsomol Central Committee approves the initiative of young workers at the Sverdlovsk prefabricated reinforced concrete structure and component factory to complete the construction task one year ahead of schedule. Moreover, in view of the extremely important significance of the successful completion of the construction of these factories, and taking into account the suggestions of Komsomol members and young people, it has been specially decided to send 100,000 volunteer Komsomol members and young people to work on the construction sites of prefabricated reinforced concrete structure and component factories.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th] The youth of Sverdlovsk are actively participating in the construction of local prefabricated reinforced concrete structure and component factories and are calling on Komsomol members and young people from all over the country to participate in the construction of prefabricated reinforced concrete structure and component factories.

    Like Kyiv, Stalingrad, Moscow, Leningrad, and many other places, Sverdlovsk is building large-scale prefabricated reinforced concrete structure and component factories. These factories will mass-produce reinforced concrete structures and components such as walls and roofs for assembly in construction. This is a new industrial sector that industrializes and factoryizes construction work, which has a significant impact on increasing the speed of housing construction and improving the entire construction industry. Therefore, thousands of Komsomol members in Sverdlovsk actively participated in voluntary labor on the factory site, striving for the early completion of the factory. Many young workers, university students, and middle school students also used their holidays to participate in labor on the construction site. Currently, there are already thirty production teams composed of Komsomol members and young workers on the construction site. Many Komsomol members can complete twice their work quota every day.

    Not long ago, the youth of the construction site held a rally and put forward the glorious task of striving to complete the main construction work of the entire factory one year ahead of schedule, that is, in December of this year. They also issued a call to the youth on the construction sites of reinforced concrete structure and component factories in various places, asking them to continuously explore potential in their work and complete construction work ahead of schedule. They also called on young people from all over the country to work on the construction sites of prefabricated reinforced concrete structure and component factories.

    Now, their call has been responded to by Komsomol members in Moscow, Kyiv, Stalingrad and other places. The Noginsk City Committee of the Komsomol in Moscow Oblast has decided to send 200 young workers who volunteered to participate in the construction to the local reinforced concrete structure and component factory before February 15th.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th] The Soviet Union is building more than 600 factories and enterprises that produce reinforced concrete structures and components for construction. These factories and enterprises will be put into production successively in the next two years.

    The distribution areas of the new factories include Moscow, Kyiv, Sverdlovsk, Chelyabinsk, Stalingrad, Leningrad, and Kuibyshev, etc. The new factories will all be large-scale enterprises. For example, a factory being built in Sverdlovsk will produce 120,000 cubic meters of reinforced concrete structures and components for the Ural region every year. Moscow City and Oblast are building eleven such factories.

    The Soviet Union produced approximately 1.8 million cubic meters of reinforced concrete components in 1954, which will increase to 9.8 million cubic meters by 1957, an increase of more than four times.

    苏联共青团中央决派十万青年参加建筑业
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会作出了关于共青团组织参加实现苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议提出的关于建设装配式钢筋混凝土结构和构件工厂的计划的决议。
    决议指出：共青团员和青年积极参加这些工厂的建设工作，是具有极其重大意义的爱国事业。共青团中央赞同斯维德洛夫斯克装配式钢筋混凝土结构和构件工厂的青年工人提出的提前一年完成建筑任务的创议。而且鉴于胜利完成这些工厂的建设工作具有十分重要的意义，以及考虑到共青团员和青年的建议，特决定派遣十万个志愿参加的共青团员和青年到装配式钢筋混凝土结构和构件工厂的建设工地上去工作。
    【新华社莫斯科八日电】斯维德洛夫斯克的青年积极参加当地装配式钢筋混凝土结构和构件工厂的建设工作，并且号召各地的共青团员和青年参加建设装配式钢筋混凝土结构和构件工厂的活动。
    和基辅、斯大林格勒、莫斯科、列宁格勒及其他许多地方一样，斯维德洛夫斯克正在兴建规模宏大的装配式钢筋混凝土结构和构件工厂。这种工厂将大量生产供建筑上装配用的墙壁、屋顶等钢筋混凝土结构和构件。这是使建筑工作工业化、工厂化的新工业部门，对于提高房屋建筑的速度、改进整个建筑事业有巨大的作用。因此，斯维德洛夫斯克成千的共青团员积极地参加了工厂工地上的义务劳动，争取工厂的早日建成。许多青年工人、大学生、中学生还利用假日到工地上来参加劳动。现在，工地上已经有三十个由共青团员和青年工人组成的生产队。许多共青团员每天能完成两倍的工作定额。
    不久以前，建筑工地的青年们举行了集会，提出了光荣的任务，要争取提前一年，即在今年十二月完成整个工厂的主要建设工作。他们并且向各地钢筋混凝土结构和构件工厂工地的青年们发出号召，要求在工作中不断发掘潜力，提前完成建设工作。他们还号召各地的青年们到建设装配式钢筋混凝土结构和构件工厂的工地上工作。
    现在，他们的号召已得到莫斯科、基辅、斯大林格勒等地共青团员们的响应。莫斯科州诺金斯克市的共青团市委会已经决定在二月十五日前给当地的钢筋混凝土结构和构件工厂派出二百名志愿参加建设的青年工人去工作。
   【新华社莫斯科八日电】苏联正在兴建六百多个生产供建筑用的钢筋混凝土结构和构件的工厂和企业。这些工厂和企业将在今后两年内陆续投入生产。
    新工厂的分布地区包括莫斯科、基辅、斯维德洛夫斯克、车里雅宾斯克、斯大林格勒、列宁格勒和古比雪夫等。新工厂都将是规模宏大的企业。例如：在斯维德洛夫斯克兴建的一个工厂每年就将给乌拉尔地区生产十二万立方公尺的钢筋混凝土结构和构件。莫斯科市和州正在兴建十一个这种工厂。
    苏联一九五四年生产的钢筋混凝土构件约为一百八十多万立方公尺，到一九五七年将增加到九百八十万立方公尺，即增加四倍多。
