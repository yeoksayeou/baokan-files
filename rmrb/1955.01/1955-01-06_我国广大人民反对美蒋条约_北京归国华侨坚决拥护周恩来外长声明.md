Xinhua News Agency, 5th. The signing of the "US-Chiang Mutual Defense Treaty" has aroused the anger of the broad masses of the Chinese people. People in cities and villages across the country have held rallies to denounce this war treaty and are stepping up their work to support the liberation of Taiwan.

The people's rallies in all regions denounced the illegality of the US-Chiang treaty and condemned the crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. People in coastal areas such as Fujian and Zhejiang, who are frequently harassed by Chiang's bandit troops, unanimously stated: Only by liberating Taiwan, eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and removing this malignant tumor can we protect our hard-won happy lives. At rallies in many areas of Northeast China, the masses condemned the crimes of Japanese imperialism and Chiang's bandits when they ruled the Northeast. An industrial labor model in Rehe Province said at a rally: We, the working class, will never forget the pain of unemployment, freezing, and starvation under the rule and oppression of Japanese imperialism and Chiang's bandits. We will never allow Chiang's bandits to come and destroy our new life again, and we will never allow US imperialism to follow the old path of Japanese aggression against China. At a rally held by representatives from all walks of life in Inner Mongolia, the representatives brought 440 letters of determination from various ethnic groups. These letters of determination expressed a common will: Firmly support the liberation of Taiwan and smash the US-Chiang treaty!

In order to oppose the US-Chiang treaty and support the liberation of Taiwan, the broad masses of workers and peasants across the country are highly motivated in their production. Workers in many factories have completed their 1954 production tasks ahead of schedule and are welcoming the 1955 production tasks with a fighting spirit. Workers in the locomotive workshop of the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory are working hard to complete the overhaul of twelve locomotives in January this year ahead of schedule. In the remote border area of the motherland, a group of workers in the parts repair workshop of the October Automobile Repair Factory in Xinjiang Province quickly improved production efficiency after discussing their opposition to the US-Chiang treaty. Employees in many factories launched labor competitions under the slogan of supporting the liberation of Taiwan. Peasants, in order to support the struggle to liberate Taiwan, sold their surplus grain to the state and launched winter production activities. The laborers building the dikes and embankments of Dongting Lake also stated that in order to support the liberation of Taiwan, we must build the motherland's "granary" as soon as possible.

Youth and women in various regions also actively participated in activities against the US-Chiang treaty. Many women wrote letters to encourage their loved ones guarding the frontline of coastal defense. Young people enthusiastically expressed their willingness to respond to the call of the motherland at any time and fight for the liberation of Taiwan. Local organizations of various democratic parties and people's organizations in various regions also issued statements expressing their intention to strengthen unity and call on their members to work hard to support the liberation of Taiwan.

Xinhua News Agency, 5th. Returned Overseas Chinese in Beijing held a forum on the evening of the 3rd to support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement on the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty." The forum was presided over by Peng Zemin, Chairman of the Beijing Returned Overseas Chinese Federation.

At the meeting, everyone unanimously condemned the war conspiracy of the US-Chiang treaty and supported Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. Chen Qiyuan, a returned Overseas Chinese from the United States, said: The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has long been spurned by the Chinese people and has no right to conclude treaties with any country. The war threat of the US aggressive clique cannot scare the Chinese people. The Chinese people's will to liberate Taiwan is unbreakable. Hong Sisi, a returned Overseas Chinese from Malaya, said: Our liberation of Taiwan is just like our past liberation of Fujian and Guangdong. It is an internal affair of our country. Whoever interferes is interfering in our internal affairs. Wu Yixiu, a returned Overseas Chinese from Indonesia, said: I am a doctor. Taiwan is a part of our motherland's body. This part is growing poisonous bacteria like the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. We want to liberate it, just as people want to restore this part of his body to health.

Yang Chunsong, a returned Overseas Chinese from Japan, said: I am from Taiwan Province, and I know the current suffering of the people of Taiwan Province. Many Overseas Chinese in Japan are from Taiwan Province and do not want to return to Taiwan but return to the motherland. In recent years, more than 2,800 people have returned to the motherland.

Yang Wei, a returned Overseas Chinese from the Philippines, condemned the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's crimes of harming Overseas Chinese in the Philippines, saying: Chiang's bandit party cronies and secret agents extort Overseas Chinese under countless guises, such as donations for repairing warships, donations for building "embassies," and donations for Chiang's birthday... even elementary school students have to pay donations. Chang Renxia, a returned Overseas Chinese from India, said: Liberating Taiwan can save Overseas Chinese from Chiang's bandits' extortion.

The forum finally pointed out that patriotic Overseas Chinese should expose Chiang's bandit activities that harm Overseas Chinese, win over Overseas Chinese who have been deceived by Chiang's bandits, and strive to achieve the great unity of Overseas Chinese abroad. This is the practical action of Overseas Chinese abroad to support the liberation of Taiwan.

    所有地区人民的集会，都指斥了美蒋条约的非法，控诉了蒋介石卖国集团的罪行。福建、浙江等沿海地区经常遭受蒋贼军扰害的人民，一致表示：只有解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，挖掉这个毒疮，才能保住自己已得的幸福生活。在东北许多地区的集会上，群众纷纷控诉了日本帝国主义和蒋贼统治东北时的罪行。热河省一位工业劳动模范在一次集会上说：我们工人阶级永远忘不了在日本帝国主义和蒋贼统治压迫下，失业、受冻、挨饿的痛苦，我们决不允许蒋贼再来破坏我们的新生活，决不允许美帝国主义再走日本侵略中国的老路。在内蒙古各界人民代表举行的集会上，到会代表带来各族人民的决心书四百四十封。这些决心书上表示了一个共同意志：坚决支援解放台湾，粉碎美蒋条约！
    为反对美蒋条约，支援解放台湾，全国广大工人农民正高度地发挥了他们的生产热情。许多工厂的工人提前完成了一九五四年的生产任务，并以战斗的姿态迎接一九五五年的生产任务。哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂机车车间的工人正为提前完成今年一月份十二台机车的检修任务而努力。在祖国辽远的边疆——新疆省十月汽车修配厂零件修制车间一个小组的工人，在座谈了反对美蒋条约后，很快便提高了生产效率。许多工厂的职工在支援解放台湾的口号下展开了劳动竞赛。农民们为支援解放台湾的斗争，纷纷把余粮卖给国家，并展开了冬季生产活动。修建洞庭湖堤垸的民工们也都表示，为了支援解放台湾，我们要尽快修建好祖国的“粮仓”。
    各地的青年、妇女也积极参加反对美蒋条约的活动，许多妇女写信鼓励守卫在海防前线的自己的亲人。青年们都热情地表示，愿意随时响应祖国的号召，为解放台湾而斗争。各民主党派的地方组织和各地人民团体也都发表声明，表示要加强团结，号召所属成员为支援解放台湾而努力工作。

    会上，大家一致痛斥美蒋条约的战争阴谋，并拥护周外长的声明。美国归国华侨陈其瑗说：蒋介石卖国集团早被中国人民所唾弃，根本无权和任何国家缔结条约。美国侵略集团的战争威胁吓不倒中国人民。中国人民解放台湾的意志是坚不可摧的。马来亚归国华侨洪丝丝说：我们解放台湾就像我们过去解放福建、广东一样，是我国内政问题，谁来干涉，谁就是干涉我国内政。印度尼西亚归国华侨吴益修说：我是一个医生。台湾是我们祖国身体的一部分，这一部分长着蒋介石卖国集团这些毒菌，我们要解放它，正像人们要把他身体的这一部分恢复健康一样。
    日本归国华侨杨春松说：我是台湾省人，我知道台湾省人目前的痛苦。很多在日本的华侨都是台湾省人，不愿回到台湾而回到祖国大陆来，几年来回到祖国来的就有二千八百多人。
    菲律宾归国华侨杨维控诉蒋介石卖国集团在菲律宾害侨祸侨的罪行说：蒋贼党棍特务向华侨敲诈的名目有修舰捐款、建设“大使馆”捐款、蒋贼做寿捐款……等不计其数；甚至小学生都要纳捐。印度归国华侨常任侠说：解放台湾，可使华侨免受蒋贼的勒索敲诈。
    座谈会最后指出，爱国的侨胞应该揭破蒋贼的害侨活动，争取受蒋贼欺骗的侨胞，为实现国外华侨的大团结而努力，这就是国外侨胞支援解放台湾的实际行动。
