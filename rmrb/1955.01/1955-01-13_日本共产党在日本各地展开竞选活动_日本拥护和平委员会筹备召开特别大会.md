We must not give up the opportunity to bring about a shift in Japanese policy in the upcoming general election. Therefore, the Secretariat of the Japan Peace Liaison Committee has decided to convene this special congress.
    The message to the people stated: This special congress will discuss the domestic and international situation, clarify the fundamental tasks at hand, and determine the organizational policies for achieving these tasks.

    【新华社讯】东京消息：日本共产党的竞选活动已在全国各地展开。

    日本共产党在九州、东北、东海、关西、关东、北陆、北海道等地区的地方组织，也举行了准备竞选的会议，并且着重讨论了扩大竞选统一阵线的问题。关西地方的竞选对策会议，已经讨论了要推广鸟取县在最近当地选举中提出共产党、劳农党、左派和右派社会党的四党联合竞选宣言而取得胜利的经验。
    日本各地人民踊跃参加共产党的竞选会议。在北海道赤平市的一次演讲会上就有一千二百多群众参加，成为赤平市成立以来的一次大集会。
    【新华社十一日讯】东京消息：日本拥护和平委员会正在筹备于一月十四日到十五日召开一次特别大会，讨论当前日本和平运动的活动方针等问题。
    日本拥护和平委员会在为此发出的告全国人民书中说：为了把从属美国的政策转变为独立自主的政策，把敌视中、苏的政策转变为根据平等、互惠原则恢复对中国和苏联的邦交的政策，把依靠“特需”的破坏日本经济的政策，转变为以和平产业为基础的繁荣政策，总之，为了把战争政策转变为和平政策，必须集结全国人民爱好和平的力量。我们决不能放弃在不久的大选中使日本政策有所转变的机会。因此，日本拥护和平委员会书记处决定召开这次特别大会。
    告人民书说：这次特别大会将讨论国内外形势，明确当前的基本任务，并确定实现这些任务的组织方针。
