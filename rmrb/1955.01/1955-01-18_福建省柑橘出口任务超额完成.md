Fujian Province has overfulfilled its 1954 citrus export target. By the 26th of last month, 4,800 tons of citrus fruits had been shipped to the Soviet Union, exceeding the original plan by 14.3 percent. According to the plan, 2,500 tons of citrus fruits were shipped to Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. It is estimated that the citrus fruits shipped to the Soviet Union alone can be exchanged for 9,500 tons of steel. During this period, 4,075 tons of citrus fruits were also shipped to major cities and industrial and mining areas such as Beijing and Shanghai.
