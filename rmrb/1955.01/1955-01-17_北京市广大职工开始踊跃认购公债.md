    【This newspaper dispatch】Since the beginning of January, workers and staff in many units in Beijing have successively begun to subscribe to the 1955 National Economic Construction Public Bonds. On January 12, after Wu Han, the director of the Beijing Public Bond Promotion Committee, made a radio speech on promoting the 1955 National Economic Construction Public Bonds, a city-wide upsurge in subscribing to public bonds began to unfold extensively in government offices, enterprises, and schools. By January 15, the subscription of public bonds by various units under the Beijing Municipal People's Government had basically concluded. Because the broad masses of workers and staff had already prepared to subscribe to public bonds, many units completed their subscriptions in just 20 to 30 minutes. According to incomplete statistics from more than 20 units, including the Beijing Municipal People's Government Finance and Economics Committee and the Public Health Bureau, the amount of public bonds subscribed has reached 930 million yuan. As of January 15, the district-level organs in the suburban areas had subscribed to a total of 480 million yuan in public bonds. Feng Xiangling, a cadre of the Dongsi District People's Government, is usually very frugal. Last year, he bought public bonds with 5 million yuan of his savings over the years, and this year he subscribed to another 1 million yuan. As of January 15, workers and shop assistants in Chongwen District had subscribed to more than 540 million yuan in public bonds. On January 13, the Beijing Railway Administration held a road-wide telephone conference to mobilize subscriptions to the National Economic Construction Public Bonds. As of January 15, the internal staff of the Beijing Railway Administration had already subscribed to 350 million yuan in public bonds.
