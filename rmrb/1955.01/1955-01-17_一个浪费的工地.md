    A Wasteful Construction Site
    Hu Yiju, Li Zuqin
    The first-phase construction project of the Zhengzhou Oil and Chemical Factory, undertaken by the Sixth Engineering Office of the Henan Provincial Construction Engineering Company in 1954, had the conditions to comprehensively complete its plan based on the preparation work before construction. However, due to many systems being mere formalities and serious waste, the costs increased, and the task of increasing production and practicing economy required by higher authorities could not be completed.
    The structure of this project was relatively complex, with many prefabricated installation works, and there was a lack of experience, which brought difficulties to the construction. However, the causes of waste were mostly due to insufficient subjective effort. For example, although on-site layout was done before construction, after materials entered the site, they were mostly not stacked in designated areas according to the plan. Also, there were no strict procedures for material requisition and return during use, resulting in chaotic grabbing and usage. Materials on the site were constantly moved around. In addition to the fixed ten or so laborers who were specially assigned for transportation each month, the small transportation fees paid for just using handcarts to move materials reached 52 million yuan. Installing prefabricated beams was an unfamiliar task. The construction site started working without a well-developed work plan, and the rented crane was about two meters lower than the roof, making it unusable. In this situation, they neither replaced the machinery nor thought of other solutions. To catch up with the progress, they raised the ground with soil to increase the height of the machinery, which increased the earthwork by more than 3,200 cubic meters. Because of the earthwork, the machinery could not be put into production in time. During the 40 and a half days of the lease period, it was only used for 10 and a half days, resulting in over-planned payments for earthwork wages and machinery rental fees totaling 83 million yuan. There was a lack of inspection of safety measures during construction, resulting in the breakage of the machinery's steel wire rope during installation, damaging part of the prefabricated beams and prefabricated roof panels, causing a loss of 14 million yuan in labor and material costs. In terms of labor use, there was serious idleness due to improper allocation. For example, the "brick arch roof" of the cottonseed warehouse was equipped with 120 people both above and below the scaffolding, but only two small brick arches could be made in one day. The actual operation time was only four to five hours, and the rest of the time was temporarily allocated for odd jobs or left to be idle. In this item alone, wage waste reached 15 million yuan within 20 days (a total of 39 brick arches). The severity of the waste can also be seen from the value of the work completed by the workers. For example, in May, the average person completed 176,700 yuan per day, which suddenly dropped to 121,500 yuan in June, and then to 110,600 yuan in July, only completing 61.44 percent of the quota set by the former Central South Construction Engineering Bureau, resulting in wage losses. There were many phenomena of not constructing according to technical operating procedures. For example, the plastering of the open ditch was stipulated to be two centimeters thick, but it was all plastered to four centimeters thick. This item alone wasted labor and material costs of more than 28.9 million yuan. Another example is taking 2.5 cm thick pine boards to build runways, instead of using waste materials and board edges, which not only degraded the use value of the materials, but also wasted amortization fees of more than 6 million yuan. Due to the low turnover rate of formwork boards, amortization fees were increased by more than 65 million yuan. The above few items alone wasted a total of 264 million yuan, accounting for 5.29 percent of the total project value. Other aspects of waste have not yet been calculated.
    The reason why this construction site has such a large amount of waste is inseparable from the serious supply system thinking of the management personnel. This construction site had no cost reduction plan at all. When the higher authorities assigned the task of increasing production and practicing economy, the director, Lu Zhou, in order to perfunctorily deal with the matter, simply handed it over to the financial department to calculate, and no measures or plans for cost reduction were formulated at all. He only thought: this is a key construction site, and whether it is equipment or manpower, it should be stronger than other construction sites, and everything should be available and as much as possible. For example, this project had a lot of prefabricated installation work and little wood processing, but in order to enrich the equipment, an electric saw was still installed. As a result, other construction sites urgently needed wood for processing but had no electric saw, but this construction site idled the electric saw and workers for more than a month. In terms of personnel allocation, there was overstaffing. The work system was chaotic, and no research was done on how to establish a normal construction order. During construction, only progress was focused on, and no means were spared. When time was tight, overtime was worked, thinking that building the house was all that mattered, and that it was 100 percent completion of the task. As long as it didn't affect the progress of the project, wasting a little material was a small matter. For example, some formwork boards for prefabricated products were brought from other construction sites, but it was thought that this batch of formwork boards had been used once and that the processing was time-consuming, so they were asked to buy new ones, resulting in the old formwork boards still being stockpiled, and the new formwork boards being sawed into small pieces that could no longer be used for other projects. The workers plastering the open ditch couldn't plaster two centimeters thick due to poor technology. At this time, the leaders not only didn't think of ways to solve this problem, but also allowed the workers to plaster four centimeters thick in order to catch up with the progress. Various systems were very unsound, and the existing systems could not be implemented. The materials department could not strictly implement the material and tool requisition, return, and storage systems, let alone supervise and rationally use materials. As long as there was a material requisition form, the warehouse material would be issued regardless of the purpose, without controlling it beforehand, and only settling the accounts afterwards. The management personnel believed that as long as the project was not stopped due to lack of materials, they had fulfilled their responsibilities. "Materials leaving the door had nothing to do with me," so materials were taken away and no one cared. Wood, nails, saws... were everywhere, no one checked or sorted them, and they were left to be exposed to rain and sun. Tools were often lost. More than 80 percent of the small nail hammers were lost, and nearly half of the rubber shoes were lost. The total number of tools is still unclear. The financial department became a cashier department and could not play a supervisory role. As long as the leaders signed, payments were made regardless of the purpose, and cost management was out of the question. Even funds from other project accounts were misappropriated to purchase scaffolding and build runways for this construction site. In short, from top to bottom, from production to management, this construction site was equally indifferent to accounting and did not consider cost work. Even when the project was already losing money, acting director Zhang Yu said, "Is it really losing money? Anyway, it's all the country's..."
    We believe that this construction site can reduce project costs and complete the savings plan of reducing costs by 3 to 5 percent. From the perspective of construction preparation and manpower allocation, it can provide good conditions for cost reduction. Before the project was constructed, a construction organization design was made, and after construction, the "group task list" and "material balance accounting method" were successively promoted, which were effective measures to mobilize workers and strengthen management. However, due to insufficient attention from the leadership, the "material balance accounting method" died out after a short trial. If construction preparation can be well strengthened in the future, various construction plans can be correctly formulated, and the existing management system can be resolutely implemented, the balance of construction will be maintained, and confusion and waste will be greatly avoided. The key to strengthening this work lies in clearly establishing the concept of economic accounting and fully completing the plan.

    一个浪费的工地
    胡彝琚  李祖沁
    河南省建筑工程公司第六工程处在一九五四年度承建的郑州油脂化学厂建厂一期工程，从施工前的准备情况看，是有条件全面完成计划的。然而由于有许多制度流于形式，浪费现象严重，以致增大了成本、完不成上级所要求的增产节约任务。
    这个工程的结构较复杂，预制安装工程较多，并且又缺乏经验，这都给施工带来一定的困难，但是，造成浪费的原因多是因为主观努力不够。例如，施工前虽然也作了现场布置，但材料进场后，大都不按平面图布置区堆放，使用时又没有严格的领料退料手续，就形成乱抓乱用，现场上的材料终日东拉西搬，除每月固定十余名小工专门运送外，仅用架子车拉材料付出的小搬运费即达五千二百多万元。安装预制大梁本是个生疏的工作，工地上没有成熟的工作计划就动手干了，结果租赁来的起重吊车低于屋顶约两公尺，不能使用。在这种情况下，他们既不更换机械，也不想其他解决办法，为了赶进度，就用土垫高地面，以此提升机械高度，因而增加垫土方三千二百多立方公尺。因为垫土，机械便不能及时投入生产，在四十天半的租赁期中，只使用了十天半，超计划支付垫土方工资和机械租赁费八千三百多万元。施工中缺乏对安全措施的检查，以致安装时机械钢丝绳中断，碰断部分预制大梁和预制屋面板，损失工料费一千四百多万元。在人工使用方面，由于调配不当，窝工现象严重。如棉籽库“砖拱屋面”架上架下共配备了一百二十人，一天只能作两个小砖拱，实际操作时间仅四至五小时，其余时间就临时分配些零活或听其窝工，只此一项二十天内（共三十九个砖拱）即浪费工资达一千五百万元。从工人完成工作的价值上也可以看出浪费的严重。如五月份平均每人每天完成一十七万六千七百元，六月份骤然降低至一十二万一千五百元，七月份又降低至一十一万零六百元，只完成原中南建筑工程局定额的百分之六十一点四四，形成工资方面的亏损。不按技术操作规程施工的现象很多。如粉明沟，规定是粉两公分厚，结果全粉成四公分厚，只此一项即浪费工料费二千八百九十多万元。又如拿二公分五厚的松木板去搭跑道，而不利用废料和板边，既贬低了材料的使用价值，又浪费了摊销费六百多万元。由于盒子板周转率不高，也增大了摊销费达六千五百多万元。仅仅上述几项共浪费二亿六千四百多万元。占工程总值的百分之五点二九。其他方面的浪费还未计算在内。
    这个工地之所以会有这样大的浪费，是和管理人员的严重的供给制思想分不开的。这个工地根本没有降低成本的计划。当上级布置增产节约的时候，主任陆洲为了敷衍塞责，只交给财务部门随便算算，根本没有制订降低成本的措施计划。只想着：这是个重点工地，无论是设备、人力，都应该比其他工地强，应该样样具备、多多益善。如这个工程预制安装工程多，木材加工少，但为了充实设备，仍然安装了一部电锯，结果其他工地亟待使用木料而没电锯加工，这个工地却连电锯带工人闲了一个多月没有事做。在人员配备上是人浮于事。工作制度乱，不研究如何建立正常的施工秩序，施工时只抓进度不择手段，时间紧了就加班加点，认为盖起房子就算万事大吉，就算百分之百的完成任务，只要不影响工程进度，浪费点材料是小事情。如预制品用的盒子板，本来自其他工地运来一部分，但认为这批盒子板已用过一次，加工费时间，就叫买新的用，以致旧盒子板仍然积压，新盒子板都锯成碎块再也不能用于其他工程了。工人粉明沟因技术差不能粉两公分厚，这时领导上不但不去想办法解决这个问题，为了赶进度便让工人粉四公分厚。各种制度很不健全，现行制度也不能贯彻。材料部门不能严格地执行材料、工具的领、退和保管制度，更谈不上对材料的监督和合理使用了。仓库材料只要有领料单，不管用途如何就向外发，事先不控制，只等事后算总账，管理人员认为只要是工程不停工待料就算尽到了职责，“材料出门与己无关”，以致材料领走了没人管，木料、钉、釟锯……到处皆是，无人检查整理，任凭雨淋日晒。工具时常丢失，小钉锤丢失了百分之八十以上，胶鞋遗失近一半，到现在总的工具数字还弄不清。财务部门变成了出纳部门，起不到监督作用，只要领导方面签字，不管作什么用都按数付款，根本谈不上成本管理，甚至挪用其他工程专户款为这工地购架板、搭跑道。总之，这个工地是从上到下，从生产到管理，都是同样不问核算，不考虑成本工作。甚至工程已形成亏损时，代理主任张玉还说：“真赔钱吗？反正都是国家的……”
    我们认为这个工地可以降低工程成本，能够完成降低成本百分之三至百分之五的节约计划。从施工准备和人力配备上看，都能给降低成本提供很好的条件。工程未施工时，已作出了施工组织设计，施工后又相继地推行了“小组任务单”和“材料余额核算法”，这都是发动工人和加强管理的有效措施。但由于领导重视不够，“材料余额核算法”试行未几就流产了，如果今后能很好加强施工准备，正确制订各种施工计划，坚决贯彻已有的管理制度，就会保持施工的均衡，就会大大避免混乱和浪费。而加强这一工作的关键，在于明确树立经济核算思想和全面完成计划的观念。
