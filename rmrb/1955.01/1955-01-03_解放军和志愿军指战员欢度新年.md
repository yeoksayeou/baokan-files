    The various units fighting on the Southeast coastal defense front celebrated the New Year during breaks in the fighting. In many units stationed on Xiamen Island, loudspeakers broadcast majestic songs such as "March of the Chinese People's Liberation Army" and "Ode to the Motherland" at dawn. Colorful arches were erected at the entrances of the barracks and positions of various units. Slogans such as "Welcome 1955, Create Greater Victories!", "We Will Never Allow U.S. Imperialism to Occupy Our Territory of Taiwan!", and "We Must Liberate Taiwan!" were posted everywhere on the walls of trenches, the shields of cannons, in barracks, and in tents. The commanders and fighters of various units unanimously expressed their determination to redouble their efforts in the new year and contribute everything to the liberation of Kinmen and Taiwan, and to the defense of the motherland and world peace.

    Many units under the jurisdiction of the East China, Central South, Northwest, and Northeast Military Regions held celebration meetings, recollection evenings, symposiums, hero and model report meetings, or small-scale get-togethers, reviewing the achievements of the motherland's construction and the achievements of their own units and individuals in building a modern national defense force, and resolved to make various preparations for the liberation of Taiwan. The troops stationed in Gansu, Qinghai and other places also held New Year's group visits and military-civilian get-togethers with local people's organizations. The leaders of an air force unit in East China also gave a report to all pilots and ground crew on the current situation and tasks. Everyone unanimously expressed their determination to step up their skills, be ready to fight at any time, and resolutely fight for the liberation of Taiwan and for saving the eight million Taiwan compatriots who are living a tragic life under the criminal rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and the American aggressors.

    The newspapers, wall newspapers, and blackboard newspapers of various units published "New Year Specials."

    On the eve of the New Year, the soldiers of the CPV units erected pine gates and colorful arches at their stations, positions, and intersections, and posted various slogans. A large slogan posted on a certain unit's position read: "Raise Vigilance, Strictly Guard Positions, Defend the Socialist Construction of the Motherland." "Strengthen Unity with the Korean People and Army, and Strive for a Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Issue." Many units also published celebration specials on New Year's Day.

    The stations and positions of the CPV units were filled with festive joy. On the morning of New Year's Day, cadres and soldiers wore medals, awards, and commemorative badges, beat gongs and drums, and exchanged New Year greetings and New Year cards. Many organs and companies held New Year's group visits, and in the morning of New Year's Day, enthusiastically launched various cultural and recreational performances and sports competitions.

    During the New Year, many CPV units and nearby Korean people, as well as Korean People's Army units fighting shoulder to shoulder to guard the positions, sent representatives to each other to congratulate the New Year. The soldiers of the Second Company of a certain unit of the CPV, who were guarding the Kimhwa area shoulder to shoulder with a certain unit of the Korean People's Army, held a joint celebration with the People's Army soldiers on New Year's Eve, and sent representatives to visit the People's Army company, exchanging New Year's gifts.

    The leading organ of an engineering unit of the CPV, which was helping the Korean people build Pyongyang, received gifts of apples, rice, pork, and wine from the Korean people on the eve of the New Year to express their appreciation. At noon on New Year's Day, the Ministry of Culture and Propaganda of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea also invited the commanders and fighters of this unit and Chinese aid-Korea construction workers to watch the Korean classical opera dance "Chunhyangjeon."
