The Development of Culture and Art in the Mongolian People's Republic
Cailingdaoerji, Director of the Cultural Liaison Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Mongolian People's Republic

    In pre-revolutionary Mongolia, feudal oppression, foreign enslavement, and the reactionary forces of Lamaism weighed heavily on our people, devastating our national culture and art.
    The victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution opened a new page in the history of the Mongolian people. In 1921, under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and with the fraternal assistance of the Soviet people, the Mongolian people achieved victory in the revolution against imperialism and feudalism. On November 26, 1924, the First Great People's Khural passed the first truly people's constitution, declaring the establishment of the Mongolian People's Republic. Over the past thirty years since the founding of the Mongolian People's Republic, with the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union, it has achieved great success in economic and cultural development. Before the revolution, Mongolia was full of illiteracy, with only 0.5 percent of the population being literate. In the era of the people's government, under the wise leadership of the glorious Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the government, the Mongolian people founded the national education system and continue to develop it. After the victory of the people's revolution, the Mongolian people became the masters of the country and began to establish the first schools for the children of the people. Currently, the Mongolian People's Republic has basically eliminated illiteracy. The Mongolian People's Republic now has 377 primary schools, 31 seven-year schools, and 21 complete secondary schools. During the first five-year plan, the number of students in primary schools increased by 88.4 percent, the number of students in seven-year schools increased by 33.3 percent, the number of students in ten-year schools tripled, and the number of students in secondary specialized schools increased by 27 percent. The establishment of institutions of higher education in the country is a major achievement in the cultural construction of People's Mongolia. A senior party school named after Sukhe Bator was also established in the country, and a normal school was opened. The establishment of the Mongolian State Choibalsan University is a major event in the country's cultural life. This institution of higher learning trains hundreds of skilled professionals every year, including doctors, veterinarians, breeders, and teachers. Choibalsan University is conducting large-scale scientific research work in close connection with the practice of socialist construction in our country. During the first five-year plan, the number of students in institutions of higher education doubled.
    Ensuring universal compulsory primary education for rural school-age children and preparing to implement universal compulsory seven-year education in cities such as Ulan Bator, Choibalsan, Zazelelig, Jebharlantu, Aldanbulag, and Uriki is the primary task in national education during the second five-year plan from 1953 to 1957.
    According to this task, the total number of students in all general schools in 1957 will reach 85,000, of which the number of students in secondary schools will increase by 1.3 times. By the end of the five-year plan, our country will have 28 new primary schools, 24 new seven-year schools, and 12 new ten-year schools. The draft directives for the second five-year plan stipulate the great task of developing higher education in our country. The state pays special attention to training specialized personnel with higher education. It is stipulated that a National Agricultural College with three departments (veterinary department, agricultural soil improvement department, and agricultural mechanization department) will be established from 1956, the work of training cadres in the National University will be expanded, and by the end of the five-year plan, the number of students in institutions of higher education will increase by approximately 90 percent, the number of graduates per year will increase by at least one time, and the number of freshmen enrolled in the first year should increase by 40 percent. Currently, there are more than 40 kinds of newspapers and magazines published in the Mongolian People's Republic. The central newspaper "Truth Daily" (organ of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic) has a large circulation. Also published are "Labor Daily", "Youth Truth Daily", "Pioneer Truth Daily" and other newspapers. In addition, there are political, artistic and popular science magazines: "Dawn", "Mars", "Science", "Animal Husbandry" and so on. Marxist-Leninist classics translated into Mongolian are also being published in large quantities. There are newspapers published in all eighteen aimags (provinces). The new social system has created all the conditions for the development of science that wholeheartedly serves the people. The Scientific Committee, established as early as November 1921, is the scientific center of the Mongolian People's Republic. The Scientific Committee is conducting major work in the main sectors of our national economy (animal husbandry), especially in improving Mongolian livestock breeds and increasing the production of wool, meat, and milk, and in studying the economics, feed, and mowing/grazing resources of nomadic animal husbandry. In recent years, Mongolian scientists have been conducting research on crossbreeding Mongolian sheep with Precoce sheep, and as a result, a new breed of Mongolian sheep has been cultivated, which exceeds Mongolian sheep in both weight and wool production. Work on crossbreeding Mongolian cattle with Sechev and Kazakh White-headed cattle has begun. The Scientific Committee is advancing the research work in history, economics, geography, geology, art, literature, and linguistics of the Mongolian People's Republic. From 1947 to 1952 alone, the number of scientific cadres in the Mongolian People's Republic quadrupled, and the number of scientific workers with degrees doubled. Over the past thirty years, the Scientific Committee has established a large-scale scientific library - the National Public Library named after J. V. Stalin. The second five-year plan puts forward the following tasks in science: to study and develop some of the most important practical problems in animal husbandry, agriculture, industry, and construction, to closely combine science and production, and to create conditions for reorganizing the Scientific Committee of the Mongolian People's Republic into the Academy of Sciences in the near future. In the early years after the establishment of the people's government, the Mongolian People's Republic established the people's health care system. From that time until now, the Soviet Union has constantly provided immeasurable assistance to the development of our country's health care system. The network of medical institutions is developing and expanding every year, and the number of national medical cadres is also increasing year by year. Now every aimag has hospitals and medical stations, and every sum (county) has health stations. Hospitals, medical stations, and pharmacies have also been established in large industrial enterprises and residential areas. The second five-year plan stipulates that the network of medical institutions should be expanded: hospitals should be increased by 34 percent, medical stations should be doubled, health stations should be increased by 50, sanatoriums and convalescent homes should be more than doubled, the budget for the national health care system should be increased by 50 to 60 percent, and sports and exercise should be further developed. Our country is doing everything possible to ensure the welfare and happiness of the people and to ensure their cultural, pleasant, and healthy lives.
    In the era of the people's government, the realistic art of national form and socialist content in the Mongolian People's Republic has grown and is constantly developing. The creativity of the people is the foundation of our country's modern art. The main task of our country's art is to create artistic works worthy of the people of our country who are building socialism. At present, our country has five professional theaters, nine cinemas, eighty film projectors, and twenty plastic arts studios; there are also film studios for artistic and documentary films, the Republic Acrobatic Troupe, the National Folk Song and Dance Troupe, the Children's Theater, and the Puppet Theater. Modern Mongolian art is developing along the path of advanced realistic art. The main content of our art is to reflect the current reality, to praise the advanced figures who are building and consolidating our country, and to strive for peace. Our country's dramatic art has been widely developed. Our National Musical Theater is staging scripts and operas by modern Mongolian playwrights, works by classical writers of world literature, and scripts by Soviet playwrights. In recent years, the theater has created many excellent repertoires. Among the most outstanding are Lodoitamb and Singer's script "Take Your Own Road", Vangong's script "Doctor", and composer Damdinsuren's opera "The Road to Happiness", etc. The theater's large symphony orchestra is playing works by Glinka, Tchaikovsky, Beethoven, and Chopin, as well as works by Mongolian and Soviet composers. The film industry of the Mongolian People's Republic is growing year by year. Mongolian filmmakers have produced artistic films such as "Sukhe Bator" and "Zogtu Taishi" and documentary films such as "The Mongolian People's Republic", "Thirty Years of the Mongolian People's Republic", and "The Power of World Youth".
    Modern Mongolian painting and sculpture occupy a prominent place in our country's art. The long tradition of folk plastic art is manifested in the daily necessities of our residents, such as furniture, utensils, clothing, harnesses, and weapons, and so on.
    The birth and development of modern Mongolian literature is a significant proof of the cultural prosperity in the era of our People's Revolution. The task of modern Mongolian literature is to express the infinite creativity of the laboring masses liberated from oppression, and to elucidate the life and struggle of the Mongolian people who are building socialism in their own country with full confidence.
    Poets and writers such as Nazog Tolji and Damdin Solon are widely praised among the people. The broad masses of readers especially love Nazog Tolji's work "My Motherland", Damdin Solon's novel "The Abandoned Girl" and his poem "Letter to Stalin".
    The immortal masterpieces of world classical literature, Russian literature, and Soviet literature have been translated into Mongolian, and some works by writers from various fraternal people's democratic countries and progressive writers from other countries have been published.
    Mongolian readers are familiar with the works of Shakespeare, Boccaccio, Hugo, Juli Veron, Goethe, Qu Yuan, Lu Xun and others.
    Outstanding cultural and artistic workers of the Mongolian People's Republic have won the Choibalsan Prize and received honorary titles.
    The task in the development of art is to constantly improve the ideological and artistic level of literary works, music, painting, dramatic art, and film. During the second five-year plan, our country will establish the National Opera House in Ulan Bator and establish a theater in Bayannuur aimag.
    The extensive exchange of cultural and artistic achievements between our country and the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries has had a great influence on the development of our art and culture. Cultural and artistic workers from the Soviet Union, China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, North Korea, the German Democratic Republic and other people's democratic countries have visited the Mongolian People's Republic many times. Cultural and artistic workers of the Mongolian People's Republic have also visited the Soviet Union, China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and other countries.
    Mongolian young artists participated in the international festivals in Prague, Budapest, Berlin, and Bucharest. Young performers have repeatedly won awards at the festivals.
    Under the wise leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the government, and with the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union, the Mongolian people are achieving new successes every year in our country's political, economic, and cultural construction.
    After completing the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy and cultural undertakings, the Mongolian people began to implement the second five-year plan with great labor enthusiasm. The second five-year plan is a magnificent program for the peaceful economic and cultural construction of the Mongolian People's Republic and is a major step forward for the people of our country on the road to building a socialist foundation.

    蒙古人民共和国文化和艺术的发展
    蒙古人民共和国外交部文化联络局局长  采林道尔吉
    在革命前的蒙古，封建压迫、外国奴役和喇嘛教的反动势力沉重地压在我们人民的头上，摧残我们民族的文化和艺术。
    伟大十月社会主义革命的胜利在蒙古人民历史上揭开了新的一页。一九二一年，在蒙古人民革命党的领导和苏联人民兄弟般的援助下，蒙古人民在反对帝国主义和反对封建主义的革命中取得了胜利。一九二四年十一月二十六日，第一届大人民呼拉尔通过了第一个真正的人民宪法，宣布了蒙古人民共和国的成立。蒙古人民共和国建国三十多年来，在苏联兄弟般的援助下，在经济和文化方面获得了巨大的成就。革命前的蒙古到处都是文盲，识字的人仅占全人口的百分之零点五。在人民政权的年代里，蒙古人民在光荣的蒙古人民革命党和政府的英明领导下创办了国民教育事业，并且不断地发展着它。人民革命胜利后，蒙古人民成了国家的主人，开始为人民的儿童建立了第一批学校。目前，蒙古人民共和国基本上已经没有文盲了。蒙古人民共和国现在有三百七十七所初等学校，三十一所七年制学校和二十一所完全中学。第一个五年计划期间，初等学校的学生人数增加了百分之八十八点四，七年制学校的学生人数增加了百分之三十三点三，十年制学校的学生人数增加了三倍，中等专科学校的学生人数增加了百分之二十七。高等学校在国内的设立，是人民蒙古在文化建设方面的重大成就。在国内还成立了以苏赫·巴托尔的名字命名的高级党校，开办了师范专科学校。蒙古国立乔巴山大学的成立是国家文化生活中的一件大事。这所高等学校每年培养出数以百计的熟练专门人材，其中有医生、兽医、饲养师和教师。乔巴山大学在同我国社会主义建设的实践密切联系中进行着大规模的科学研究工作。在第一个五年计划期间，高等学校的学生人数增加了一倍。
    保证农村学龄儿童的普遍义务初等教育和准备在乌兰巴托、乔巴山、宰宰列格、哲布哈兰图、阿尔丹布拉克和乌里基等城市实施七年制普遍义务教育，是一九五三——一九五七年第二个五年计划中在国民教育方面的首要任务。
    根据这个任务，一九五七年所有普通学校的学生人数将达到八万五千人，其中中等学校的学生人数将增加一点三倍。到五年计划结束时，我国将有二十八所新的初等学校，二十四所新的七年制学校和十二所新的十年制学校。第二个五年计划的指示草案规定了发展我国高等教育的巨大任务。国家特别关心培养受过高等教育的专门人材。规定从一九五六年起设立有三个系（兽医系、农业土壤改良系和农业机械化系）的国立农业专科学校，扩大在国立大学中培养干部的工作，到五年计划结束时使高等学校的学生人数大约增加百分之九十，每年的毕业人数至少要增加一倍，一年级招生人数应增加百分之四十。目前蒙古人民共和国出版的报纸和杂志共有四十多种。中央报纸“真理报”（蒙古人民革命党中央委员会和蒙古人民共和国政府的机关报）的发行数量很大。还出版有“劳动报”、“青年真理报”、“少先真理报”和其他报纸。此外出版的还有政治、艺术和通俗科学杂志：“曙光”、“火星”、“科学”、“畜牧”等等。译成蒙文的马克思列宁主义经典著作也在大量出版。在所有十八个艾马克（省）都有报纸出版。新的社会制度给全力为人民服务的科学的发展创造了一切条件。早在一九二一年十一月成立的科学委员会，是蒙古人民共和国的科学中心。科学委员会在我国国民经济主要部门（畜牧业）中、尤其在改良蒙古的牲畜品种和提高羊毛、肉和乳的产量的事业中、在研究游牧畜牧业的经济、饲料和割草场—牧场的富源方面，都在进行着重大的工作。近年来，蒙古科学家们在进行着关于蒙古绵羊同朴列考斯绵羊的异种交配工作，结果培养出了蒙古绵羊的新品种，这种绵羊无论在体重和羊毛产量方面都超过了蒙古绵羊。关于蒙古牛同塞切夫种牛和哈萨克白头牛的异种交配工作已经开始了。科学委员会正在把蒙古人民共和国的历史学、经济学、地理学、地质学、艺术学、文学和语言学的研究工作推向前进。仅在一九四七到一九五二年内，蒙古人民共和国的科学干部就增加了四倍，得到学位的科学工作者增加了两倍。科学委员会三十多年来建立了规模巨大的科学图书馆——以约·维·斯大林的名字命名的国立公共图书馆。第二个五年计划在科学方面提出了下列任务：研究发展畜牧业、农业、工业、建筑业中的一些最重要的实际问题，使科学和生产密切结合起来，为在最近几年把蒙古人民共和国科学委员会改组成为科学院创造条件。在人民政权建立后的最初几年，蒙古人民共和国就建立了人民的保健事业。从那个时候起直到现在，苏联不断地给我国保健事业的发展以无可估量的帮助。医药机关网每年都在发展和扩大，国家医药干部的人数也在逐年增加。现在每个艾马克都有医院和医疗站，每个苏木（县）有助医站。在大工业企业和居民点也设立了医院、医疗站和药房。第二个五年计划规定要扩大医药机关网：医院应增加百分之三十四，医疗站应增加一倍，助医站应增加五十个，休养所和疗养院应增加一倍以上，国家保健事业的预算增加百分之五十到六十，进一步开展体育和运动。我国正尽一切力量使人民得到福利和幸福，使他们的文化、愉快和健康的生活得到保证。
    在人民政权的年代中，蒙古人民共和国的民族形式和社会主义内容的现实主义艺术已经成长起来并不断地发展着。人民的创造力是我国现代艺术的基础。创造无愧于正在建设社会主义的我国人民的艺术作品，是我国艺术的主要任务。目前我国有五个职业剧院、九个电影院、八十部电影放映机和二十个造型艺术工作室；还有艺术片和纪录片的电影制片厂、共和国杂技团、国立民间歌舞团、儿童剧院和木偶剧院。现代蒙古的艺术正在循着先进的现实主义艺术的道路向前发展。我们的艺术的主要内容是反映当前的现实生活，表扬建设和巩固我们国家的先进人物，争取和平。我国的戏剧艺术已有了广泛的发展。我们的国立音乐剧院在上演现代蒙古剧作家的剧本和歌剧、世界文学古典作家的作品和苏联剧作家的剧本。近年来，剧院创造了许多卓越的剧目。其中最精彩的是洛多依丹布和辛格的剧本“走自己的道路”、万贡的剧本“医生”和作曲家达木丁苏伦的歌剧“走向幸福的道路”等。剧院的大交响乐队在演奏格林卡、柴可夫斯基、贝多芬和萧邦的作品，以及蒙古和苏联作曲家的作品。蒙古人民共和国的电影事业在年复一年地成长着。蒙古电影工作者摄制了“苏赫·巴托尔”和“左格图·泰什”等艺术片和“蒙古人民共和国”、“蒙古人民共和国三十年”、“世界青年的力量”等文献纪录片。
    现代蒙古的绘画和雕塑在我国艺术中占有显著的位置。民间造型艺术的悠久传统表现在我国居民的日常生活用品，如家具、器皿、衣服、马具和武器等等上面。
    现代蒙古文学的诞生和发展是我国人民革命年代中文化繁荣的显著证明。现代蒙古文学的任务是表现从压迫中解放出来的劳动群众的无穷的创造力、阐明满怀信心地在自己国家中建设社会主义的蒙古人民的生活和斗争。
    诗人、作家那左克·托尔日和丹姆丁·索龙等在民间受到广泛的赞扬。广大的读者群众特别喜爱那左克·托尔日的作品“我的祖国”，丹姆丁·索龙的小说“被抛弃的姑娘”和他的诗“给斯大林的信”。
    世界古典文学、俄国文学和苏联文学的不朽名著都译成了蒙文，并出版了各兄弟人民民主国家作家的以及其他各国进步作家的某些作品。
    蒙古读者熟悉莎士比亚、薄伽丘、雨果、裘里·味纶、歌德、屈原、鲁迅等人的作品。
    蒙古人民共和国优秀的文化和艺术工作者荣获了乔巴山奖金并得到了荣誉称号。
    艺术发展方面的任务是不断提高文学作品、音乐、绘画、戏剧艺术和电影的思想和艺术水平。在第二个五年计划期间我国将在乌兰巴托建立国立歌剧院，并在巴音努里基艾马克建立剧院。
    我国同苏联以及各人民民主国家文化和艺术成就的广泛交流，对我国艺术和文化的发展产生了巨大的影响。苏联、中国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、朝鲜、德意志民主共和国以及其他人民民主国家的文化和艺术工作者曾多次到蒙古人民共和国访问。蒙古人民共和国的文化和艺术工作者也曾访问过苏联、中国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利和其他国家。
    蒙古青年艺术工作者参加了布拉格、布达佩斯、柏林、布加勒斯特的国际联欢节。青年演出者屡次在联欢节上得奖。
    蒙古人民在蒙古人民革命党和政府的英明领导下，在苏联兄弟般的帮助下，在我国政治、经济和文化建设中每年取得新的成就。
    蒙古人民完成了发展国民经济和文化事业的第一个五年计划之后，开始以巨大的劳动热情实行第二个五年计划。第二个五年计划是蒙古人民共和国和平的经济和文化建设的宏伟纲领，是我国人民在建立社会主义基础的道路上前进的一大步。
