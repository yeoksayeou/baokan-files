    Two Hundred Days of Underwater Exploration
    Su Linke, Deputy Captain of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Geological Drilling Team
    The drilling rigs that had been anchored in the heart of the river for so long have now stopped turning. On January 10th, the underwater exploration work for the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was completely finished.
    As early as March 1950, the Ministry of Railways sent geological exploration personnel to conduct preliminary exploration in the Wuchang and Hanyang areas, covering approximately six square kilometers. In February 1954, based on the results of this preliminary exploration, the Ministry of Geology, the Ministry of Water Resources, and the Ministry of Railways jointly selected a group of geological, drilling, and administrative personnel to form the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Geological Drilling Team and begin large-scale technical design exploration.
    Profound Assistance
    At the beginning of the design exploration, because the geological exploration personnel involved had no experience in deep-water exploration, we brought in drilling machinery used in mines but did not prepare the necessary equipment and materials for offshore drilling. Although the start date was set, the material supply couldn't keep up, and we were beginning to encounter difficulties. At this time, all parties extended a helping hand to us. When we needed to process a batch of large casing pipes, casing clamps, and drilling tools, Wuchang Shipyard, Wuhan Power Machine Factory, Jiang'an Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, and Kaiming Machine Factory helped us with rush processing in time to ensure the needs for starting work. When the first pier started construction and the drilling rig was already in operation, we temporarily discovered that we were missing two large casing lifting devices due to lack of experience, and the casing work was immediately hindered. At this time, the materialman ran to the Wuhan Power Machine Factory. The comrades of the factory immediately unloaded the items being produced from the lathe to process the lifting devices for us. When Wuchang Shipyard was processing flap drill bits for us, technical difficulties arose because it was the first time they had made them. The workers said, "No matter how difficult it is, we must complete the task and ensure the drilling construction of the Yangtze River Bridge." In just three days, they quickly made a dozen flap drill bits.
      When we started construction on piers one and four, the machinery experienced difficulties again, and we needed to immediately resolve the issue of casing joints with a diameter of 273 millimeters, spring drill bits, and more than a dozen other tools. At this time, we sent people to Zhangjiakou Prospecting Machinery Factory to negotiate this batch of processing tasks. From leading cadres to workshop workers, the factory unanimously said, "You are the exploration team responsible for drilling the Yangtze River Bridge. We must support you and organize construction immediately!" In a few days, this batch of drilling tools was successively released from the factory. In order to quickly transport these tools to the construction site, the Zhangjiakou Railway Administration used the baggage car of a passenger train as an express shipment. In a few days, this batch of drilling equipment was transported from distant Zhangjiakou to the Wuhan construction site.
    Good Teachers and Helpful Friends
    At the beginning, the comrades of our geological drilling team lacked the technical knowledge of deep-water drilling. Soviet expert Comrade Mashukov gave us a lot of help. Before construction, he personally conducted on-site investigations, studied the geological data from the preliminary exploration, and made a comprehensive geological exploration design for us. At that time, regarding drilling equipment, some people advocated still using the old equipment, using small wooden boats and small drilling rigs to undertake the arduous and complex offshore exploration. Comrade Mashukov analyzed the shortcomings of using this equipment. He pointed out: "Using small wooden boats with a load capacity of dozens of tons cannot install several drilling rigs on one boat. Then, one pier needs to drill five holes. If one drilling rig is used, the drilling boat needs to move several times on one pier, which is not economical in terms of time; at the same time, this kind of small wooden boat is also very difficult to work with in seasons of strong winds and high water. Using small drilling rigs, because the diameter of the drill bit is too small, there is no definite guarantee for the quality of drilling. In this way, it is also inappropriate to guarantee the completeness and accuracy of geological data and meet the needs of engineering design." Therefore, he suggested using iron barges with a load capacity of 800 tons, installing five 500-type drilling rigs on each iron barge, so that five drill holes for one pier could be completed at once. This would not only improve efficiency and shorten the construction period, but also ensure drilling quality and obtain complete and accurate geological data. Facts have proved that Comrade Mashukov's suggestion was completely correct. If we only used small wooden boats and small drilling rigs for deep-water drilling, it would not have been possible to complete offshore drilling and ensure the quality of work in a short period of several months. This would inevitably prolong the construction period and affect the design and construction of the bridge.
    After the underwater drilling started, the work raised new technical requirements for us. For example, protection casings often could not reach the bottom of the river for several days, and sometimes even broke. We also didn't know how to do overburden sampling, water shutoff, and pumping tests. If these problems were not resolved, we could not drill in, and we could not obtain correct data on the friction coefficient of the overburden and the permeability of the rock. Without this information, engineering design and construction would encounter difficulties. In order to overcome the difficulties facing them, the geological and drilling personnel actively studied the advanced experience of Soviet geological science, and under the guidance of Comrade Mashukov, designed and modified dozens of previously non-existent offshore drilling tools, overcame the technical difficulties of offshore construction, and learned the technical operations of deep-water exploration. It was precisely because of this friendly assistance from Comrade Mashukov that it was possible for us to complete the underwater exploration work of the Wuhan Bridge in seven months. When we completed the drilling work of the first pier, it took us forty days, then it took an average of twenty days, and finally we only needed an average of eight days to complete the drilling work of one pier. In the four months of June, July, August and September, we completed the drilling work of four piers, and in the following three months and eight days, we completed the drilling of seventeen piers. As we now end the underwater exploration work, we cannot help but miss and thank Expert Mashukov for the selfless help he has given us during these days!
    Fighting the Flood
    Just as the underwater exploration entered a tense stage, the flood of the Yangtze River arrived. Drifting debris flowed down the river, hitting the drilling boats. One afternoon in late September, a strong wind rose, and huge waves surged on the river. Waves several feet high hit the drilling boats one after another. The huge pontoons rose and fell with the waves, sometimes sinking and sometimes rising above the river surface. The drill towers, several meters high, swayed in the wind, creaking. At this time, nothing could be seen on the entire river surface, navigation was blocked, and land and water transportation was cut off. The sailors and drillers were dizzy and vomiting from the turbulence, trapped on the drilling boats. The wind grew stronger, and the casing inserted into the river bottom was lifted one or two meters high by the waves, hitting the drilling boat with a clang. After a while, the anchor rope broke, and the 250 mm base wood was broken, making an explosive sound like a bomb. Experienced sailors and veteran workers became the commanders of this battle. People put on life jackets, and each anchor rope was guarded by a dedicated person. Some went to the cabin to check; others dismantled the drilling rig and moved the important equipment to the center of the ship. The tense situation was like a lone boat encountering a sea breeze. In this way, they endured hunger and the pain of the wind and waves, and persisted in fighting the wind and waves for a day and a night.
      When the flood arrived, in order to prevent attacks by floating debris, the sailors held scythes and grappling hooks, guarding the bow of the ship day and night to salvage floating debris and protect the safety of the drilling boat. In order to insert the casing into the river bottom, it was necessary to remove the obstacles of floating debris accumulated at the bottom of the boat. The drillers bravely jumped down and salvaged the floating debris. Some comrades were bitten by poisonous snakes that came with the floating debris, and another comrade continued to go down and fight the poisonous snakes. Hundreds of poisonous snakes were eliminated every day, and piles of floating debris were salvaged. Finally, the casing was lowered to the bottom of the river. It was this tenacious fighting spirit that allowed them to persist in working under high water levels. When we persisted in construction under high water levels, it was also the most tense stage of the Wuhan flood control struggle. The heroic actions of the Wuhan people in the flood control struggle gave us the most profound education. It was they who gave us encouragement and strength, enabling us to overcome the difficulties of the flood.
      When our underwater exploration work was nearing completion, we encountered Wuhan's rare severe cold. The entire drilling boat parked in the heart of the river was covered with ice and snow. If someone was not careful, the skin on their hands would be stuck to the casing. The tents built with wooden boards and tarpaulins were now like four walls leaking wind. The coal stoves and charcoal basins inside the tents seemed unable to block any cold air, and people seemed to be working in an ice cellar. The drilling work on piers two and four was completed under these conditions.

    水下勘探二百天
    武汉长江大桥地质钻探队副队长　苏林克
    长久以来停泊在江心中的趸船上的钻探机，现在已经停止了转动，武汉长江大桥的水下勘探工作，在一月十日全部完成了。
    这个勘探工作，早在一九五零年三月，中央铁道部就派来了地质勘探人员，在武昌、汉阳一带，约六平方公里的地区内，进行过初步勘探。一九五四年二月，根据这个地区初步勘探的结果，接着由中央地质部、水利部、铁道部，又抽调了一批地质、钻探及行政管理人员，联合组成武汉长江大桥地质钻探队，开始进行大规模的技术设计勘探。
    深切的援助
    在设计勘探的开工之初，因为参加地质勘探人员，过去没有在深水搞过勘探工作，所以我们除了把矿山使用的钻探机械运来以外，对水上钻探所需的设备及料具都没有准备。开工的日子虽然确定了，可是材料供应跟不上来，正在开始遇到困难的时候，各方面都向我们伸出了援助的手。当我们有一批大型套管、套管夹板及钻探工具需要加工的时候，武昌造船厂、武汉动力机厂、江岸机车车辆修理厂、开明机器厂等，及时帮助我们突击加工，保证了开工的需要。第一个桥墩开工了，钻机已经开动，但由于没有经验，临时发现缺少两个大型套管提引器，下套管的工作马上受到阻碍。这时材料员跑到武汉动力机厂去，该厂的同志们立即把正在生产的东西从车床上卸下来，为我们加工提引器。武昌造船厂为我们加工活瓣钻头时，因初次制做，技术上发生了困难，工人们说：“无论怎样困难，一定完成任务，保证长江大桥钻探施工。”只三天时间，把十几个活瓣钻头很快地做好了。
      我们在一、四号桥墩开工时，机具又发生了困难，需要马上解决直径二七三个公厘大的套管接头，弹簧钻头等十几种工具。这时，我们派人去张家口探矿机械厂接洽这批加工任务，该厂从领导干部到车间工人异口同声地说：“你们是担负长江大桥钻探的勘探队，一定支持，马上组织施工！”不几天，这批钻探工具就陆续出厂了。为了迅速把这些工具运到工地，张家口铁路管理局用客运列车的行李车，作为快件发运，几天的时间，这批钻探器材就由遥远的张家口运到了武汉工地。
    良师和益友
    我们这支地质钻探队的同志们，开始时，缺乏深水钻探的技术知识。苏联专家马舒柯夫同志给了我们很大的帮助。在施工前，他亲自进行实地调查，研究了初步勘探的地质资料，为我们作出了全面的地质勘探设计。当时，在钻探设备上，有些人主张仍然沿用旧有设备，用小型木船及小型钻机，担负艰巨复杂的水上勘探。马舒柯夫同志分析了采用这种设备的缺点。他指出：“用载重几十吨的小型木船，不能在一只船上安装几台钻机，那么，一个桥墩需打五个孔，如果用一台钻机工作，钻船在一个桥墩要迁移几次，从时间上看是不经济的；同时这种小型木船，在大风大水季节工作也是很困难的。采用小型钻机，由于钻头直径过小，对于钻探质量的保证也没有确切的把握，这样，对保证地质资料的完整和准确，适应工程设计的需要也是不妥当的。”因此，他建议使用载重八百吨的铁驳，每艘铁驳上安装五台五○○型的钻机，这样，一个桥墩五个钻孔，一次就可以工作完毕。不但能提高效率，缩短工期，而且能保证钻探质量，获得完整准确的地质资料。事实证明马舒柯夫同志的建议是完全正确的。如果我们只用小型木船和小型钻机在深水进行钻探的话，在短短几个月的时间内，要想完成水上钻探和保证工作质量是不可能的。那就势必拖长工期，影响大桥的设计和施工。
    水下钻探开工以后，工作向我们提出了新的技术要求。如保护套管常常几天下不到江底，有时甚至折断。覆盖层取样、止水、抽水试验等也都不会作。这些问题解决不了，就不能钻进，对于覆盖层的磨擦系数、岩石的渗透性质，就不能得出正确的资料，没有这方面的资料，工程设计及施工都会发生困难。地质、钻探人员为战胜面临的困难，积极学习了苏联地质科学的先进经验，并在马舒柯夫同志的指导下，设计改制了数十种过去未有的水上钻探工具，克服了水上施工技术方面的困难，学会了深水勘探的技术操作。正由于马舒柯夫同志这种友谊的帮助，这才有可能使我们在七个月的时间内，完成了武汉大桥的水下勘探工作。我们完成第一个桥墩的钻探工作时，用去了四十天，后来就平均需二十天，最后我们平均只要八天的时间就可以完成一个桥墩的钻探工作了。在六、七、八、九四个月中，我们完成了四个桥墩的钻探工作，而在以后三个月零八天的时间内，我们完成了十七个桥墩的钻探。当我们现在结束水下勘探工作的时候，我们心里不能不想念和感谢马舒柯夫专家在这些日子里给过我们的无私的帮助！
    和洪水斗争
    当水下勘探刚进入紧张的阶段，长江的洪水来到了。漫江浮漂物顺水而来，撞击钻船。九月下旬的一个下午，起了大风，江面上掀起了惊涛骇浪，几尺高的浪头，一个接一个的打在钻船上，巨大的趸船，随着浪头起伏不定，忽而沉下了，忽而又露出江面，数公尺高的钻塔迎风摇摆，吱吱作响。这时，整个江面上什么东西也看不到，航行被阻，陆地与水上交通断绝了，水手、钻工们被颠簸得头晕呕吐，困在钻船上。风更大了，插在江底的套管被浪头掀起一、二公尺高，碰在钻船上，当当的响。一会儿锚绳断了，二五○公厘的基台木顶断了，发出像炸弹那样爆炸的声音。有经验的水手和老工人们，成为这个战斗的指挥员，人们穿上了救生衣，每根锚绳都由专人把守，有的去船舱内检查；有的把钻机拆掉，把重要的器材搬到了船中央。紧张的局面像是遭遇海风的孤舟一样。就这样，他们忍着饥饿，忍着风浪颠簸的苦痛，坚持同风浪搏斗一昼夜。
      在洪水到来的时候，为防止浮漂物的袭击，水手们拿着镰刀、挠钩，日日夜夜坚守在船头上打捞浮漂物，保卫钻船安全。为把套管插入江底，必须扫除聚集船底浮漂物的障碍，钻工们勇敢地跳下去，把浮漂物打捞上来，有的同志被伴随浮漂物而来的毒蛇咬伤了，另一个同志又接着下去与毒蛇搏斗，每日上百条的毒蛇被消灭了，成堆的浮漂物打捞上来，终于将套管下到江底，就是这种顽强的战斗精神，在高水位的条件下坚持工作的。当我们在高水位的情况下坚持施工的时候，也正是武汉防汛斗争最紧张的阶段，武汉人民在防汛斗争中的英雄行为，给了我们最深刻的教育，是他们给了我们鼓舞和力量，使我们能够战胜了洪水的困难。
      当我们水下勘探工作快要结束的时候，又正碰上武汉少有的严寒。停泊在江心中的整个钻船被冰雪覆盖着，有人一不小心，手上的皮就给套管黏住了。用木板和雨布搭起的帐篷，此时犹如四壁透风，帐篷里面的煤炉、木炭盆仿佛一点冷气也挡不住，人们好似在冰窖里工作一样。二、四号桥墩的钻探工作，就是在这种条件下完成的。
