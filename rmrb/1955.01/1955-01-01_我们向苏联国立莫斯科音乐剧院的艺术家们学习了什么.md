As a prominent and significant event in the cultural exchange between China and the Soviet Union, the visit and performance of the Moscow Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko State Musical Theatre of the Soviet Union in our capital, Beijing, is of great importance. The world's top-level Soviet opera and ballet appeared on the Chinese stage for the first time, concretely demonstrating the unbreakable, deep, and fraternal friendship between China and the Soviet Union.

Time and again, the quiet theater hall gently opened its crimson velvet curtain, presenting us with scene after scene of life – artistic scenes – with different styles, colors, and content. We saw "Notre Dame de Paris," depicting the struggle of the French people against the monastic rulers in the Middle Ages, and "Eugene Onegin," a picture of the life of the Russian upper class in the 19th century. We saw the fairy-tale-like ancient Russian folk tale "Swan Lake," and "The Storm," depicting the sharp class struggle in the Soviet Union during the domestic war, showing the "victory of Lenin's truth." We saw "Doctor Aybolit," a fairy tale fantasy world of kind animals and their friends, and "Zaporozhets Beyond the Danube," expressing the patriotism of the Cossacks and full of Ukrainian scenery. In terms of artistic style, there were classical grand opera, comic opera, new operas reflecting modern life, ballet, and ballet mainly for children to enjoy. The characters, plots, sounds, actions, thoughts, and emotions on the stage were so colorful and splendid that each opening revealed a fresh and magnificent ocean of art.

The high ideological and artistic quality of all the performances of the Musical Theatre, and its strict adherence to the method of socialist realism in creation, have truly enriched our people's cultural life. For us young artistic apprentices, in addition to greatly expanding our horizons of artistic appreciation, we must also draw more from it that can be used for our future artistic creation. This is true praise, true welcome, and true gratitude.

If we delve into and study the various performances of the Musical Theatre, I believe it can help us solve many specific problems of artistic creation methods, such as the problem of expressing modern life in the form of opera and ballet, the relationship between singing or dancing and the scenery, etc. But I think the main part of the study should first be placed on several principles. We should avoid the lazy thinking of directly copying and applying the specific labor results of others. Grasp the principles and spirit first, and then delve into specific research, which may yield more and more solid gains.

Let me talk about my personal experience in this regard.

What strikes us most obviously is the strong ideological tendency and the wide range of themes common to the diverse performances. Every beautiful performance is full of advanced ideas, teaching people to love the people, love the collective, love the motherland, to be kind, honest, strong, and brave, and to resolutely fight against reactionary and anti-people evil forces. And such profound ideological education is expressed on the stage through a wide range of themes and various characters, through convincing (albeit sometimes fantasy) storylines. There is no tedious preaching, no rigid formulas, only rich life and characters. The light of the people's ideological and moral strength shines from ancient, fairytale, legendary, foreign, and, of course, modern themes.

In its repertoire, the Musical Theatre, on the one hand, re-staged many highly popular classical works with new historical and artistic perspectives, and on the other hand, it put more effort into staging new dramas created by modern writers and musicians that reflected the struggle life of the contemporary people, such as "Quiet Flows the Don," "The Storm," "The Taras Family," "Lyubov Yarovaya," "Shore of Happiness," etc. In this regard, the Musical Theatre is one of the most advanced in the Soviet Union.

This is the best example, telling us how art serves politics, why art is a great and important ideological weapon, and how art is closely integrated with the people and the working class.

Secondly, the socialist realism creation method that runs through every program, and the spirit of innovation and creation that is inevitably possessed by adhering to the socialist realism creation method, I think should be given special attention, and should be repeatedly understood and learned.

The Musical Theatre's achievements in this regard constitute one of the most prominent characteristics of their artistic creation.

We know that Tchaikovsky's ballet "Swan Lake" has been widely welcomed and gained world reputation since it was performed in St. Petersburg at the end of the last century by Lev Ivanov and Marius Petipa. Since then, their artistic treatment of the ballet "Swan Lake" on the stage has formed an insurmountable standard. Although in fact, the traditional treatment still has the disadvantage of deviating from Tchaikovsky's true intentions, it has never been broken. Only the artists of the Moscow Musical Theatre, taught by the great drama masters Stanislavsky and Danchenko, broke through the habits of many years and boldly and creatively re-processed "Swan Lake" (at the same time, they still inherited the truly beautiful parts of the tradition). They were not intimidated by the past reputation, did not hold a superstitious attitude towards the achievements of their predecessors, they conducted profound and serious study and understanding of Tchaikovsky's original work, and resolutely changed the past situation where some dances deviated from the plot of the drama, deviated from the psychological development of the characters, and almost became entertainment, and prominently emphasized the logical development of the plot, clearly explained the continuous action of the entire ballet, making each act and scene an organic part of the entire play, and thus naturally revealed its great ideological content, and all this was expressed through the actions of characters with distinct personalities. Under such highly ideological treatment, the healthier and more beautiful inner life force of Tchaikovsky's "Swan Lake" was fully developed.

The performance of the new opera "The Storm" also has a brilliant creative spirit. Nemirovich-Danchenko once called it "the first real Soviet opera, and it can also be said to be the first valuable performance of Soviet opera." In this opera, we see how the Musical Theatre uses the grand opera form, which is accustomed to expressing historical and legendary themes, to successfully express the struggle life of contemporary people. Communist Party members, guerrillas, and peasants after the revolution all appeared on the opera stage; what is particularly encouraging is the great image of Lenin. For the creation of new operas in our country and the reform of local operas expressing modern life, the aesthetic principles embodied in the performance of "The Storm" have the most practical demonstration significance.

"Eugene Onegin," "Notre Dame de Paris," "Zaporozhets Beyond the Danube," and "Doctor Aybolit" are also full of youthful artistic vitality, and everywhere makes people feel the depth of thought and the fullness of emotion, and everywhere has its own unique style and is closely connected with life. This creative and innovative spirit of the Musical Theatre is integrated into every play.

In all the performances, Stanislavsky's theory of performing art is faithfully and creatively implemented and applied. This shows that the basic principles of various forms of stage art are consistent. Opera and ballet, like drama, exist to express "people," and Stanislavsky's theory was originally a theory of expressing "people," so it also applies to opera and ballet. I think these basic principles should also apply to various forms of stage art in China, from drama to opera, and even to puppet shows.

Due to this socialist realism creative and innovative spirit, the Musical Theatre is gloriously called "the true son of the revolutionary era."

Another aspect that we should learn from the performances of the Musical Theatre is the extremely serious and conscientious working attitude and collectivist spirit adopted in artistic creation, and the artistic accuracy resulting from it. As a comprehensive art, stage art relies on the joint composition of multiple artistic elements. Among them, there are primary and secondary ones, and mutual cooperation requires extremely accurate coordination with the collective strength; a slight error in time, space, or strength will lead to huge losses, weakening or even eliminating the artistic appeal and persuasiveness. In all the performances of the Musical Theatre, we see that literature and music are always the most necessary prerequisites and foundations, and in any dramatic environment, the actor-role is the master of the entire stage (but is by no means "me only"), and everything else exists around the role's activities, and mutually become an organic combination under the unified control of the director. We don't see any part with undue prominence, and no part with slack performance. Every performance is so fresh, as if it were the first performance. Every department and every role is so focused, putting all their heart and life into music and dance. Every department and every role is so skilled and comfortable, as if flying freely and unrestrainedly in the vast world, but they are closely connected, impeccable, complementary, and indispensable to each other. Only in this way can the highest degree of comprehensive art and collective art be formed, so that people can get a coordinated and consistent overall feeling when numerous artistic elements are presented before their eyes. This achievement cannot be achieved without extremely strict (due to the system's guarantee) rehearsals and a high degree of collectivist cultivation, a sense of responsibility, and a love for artistic work - I think this is of great enlightening significance for Chinese stage art.

Finally, I think we cannot only see the various achievements of the stage performances, but also must see behind the stage, and see the ordinary moments. It is very clear that: First, all the achievements of the Musical Theatre would be unimaginable without the long-term painstaking study and hard practice of all the staff for the construction of socialist culture. Even during the visit and performance, these actors, who already have high artistic accomplishment, still insist on exercising every day. This should be the best example for some of us who stop learning after achieving a little success. Second, if the Musical Theatre had not attached special importance to the training and support of new young actors from the very beginning more than 30 years ago, and fully exerted the energetic and bold creative spirit of young people who did not stick to the rules, then not only artistic achievements, but even these many excellent actors would be difficult to produce. Third, the Musical Theatre is a young theatre, and it has been able to reach the world's most advanced level in just a few decades, and it is also one of the best artistic units in the Soviet Union. This is even more unimaginable without the beautiful environment of the great socialist society and without the infinite care and help of the great Soviet Communist Party. This understanding also makes us understand how we should cherish and safeguard our great motherland and the Party and the people's regime today, and understand how to make us not only obsessed with studying in the world of art, but first become an active peace fighter and socialist builder, so that our motherland will also quickly open up thousands of purples and reds of artistic flowers!

We deeply thank the visit and performance of the Moscow Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko State Musical Theatre of the Soviet Union.

    我们向苏联国立莫斯科音乐剧院的艺术家们学习了什么
    中国戏剧家协会常务理事  刘厚生
    苏联国立莫斯科斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基与聂米罗维奇—丹钦科音乐剧院在我们的首都北京所举行的访问演出，是中国与苏联文化交流活动中一件突出的、重大的事件。具有世界最高水平的苏联歌剧和舞剧，第一次出现在中国的舞台上，具体地表现了中苏两国的牢不可破的、深厚的、兄弟般的友谊。
    一次又一次，安静的剧场大厅中轻轻地拉开了紫红色的丝绒大幕，在我们的面前展现了一个又一个具有不同风格、不同色彩、不同内容的生活场景——艺术场景。我们看到描写中世纪法国人民与僧侣统治者斗争的“巴黎圣母院”，也看到十九世纪俄国上流社会生活图画的“叶夫根尼·奥湼金”，我们看到如同仙境般的俄罗斯人民的古老的神话“天鹅湖”，也看到描画苏联在国内战争时期尖锐的阶级斗争的、表现了“列宁的真理底胜利”的“暴风雨”，我们看到童话幻想世界中的善良的动物和它们的朋友的“阿伊波利特医生”，也看到表现哥萨克人爱国主义精神和充满乌克兰风光的“多瑙河彼岸的萨坡罗什人”。就艺术样式上说来，这里有古典大歌剧，喜歌剧，反映现代生活的新的歌剧，有舞剧，有主要为儿童欣赏的舞剧。舞台上出现的人物、情节、声音、动作、思想、感情是这样地缤纷灿烂，每一次的开幕都展现了一片新鲜的、波澜壮阔的艺术海洋。
    音乐剧院的全部演出的高度思想性和艺术性，严格的社会主义现实主义创作方法，真正地丰富了我们人民的文化生活；对于我们这些年青的艺术学徒，在大大地扩展了我们艺术欣赏的视野之外，我们还必需在这中间更多地汲取能为我们今后艺术创作所用的东西。这才是真正的称赞，真正的欢迎和感谢。
    我们如果深入研究、学习音乐剧院的各个演出，我相信是可以帮助我们解决很多具体的艺术创作方法问题的，如以歌剧舞剧形式表现现代生活问题，歌或舞与布景的关系问题等等；但我觉得学习的主要部分首先还是应该放在若干原则问题上，我们应该避免那种把别人的具体劳动成果直接搬来套用的懒惰思想。先掌握住原则精神，再深入具体研究，可能收获得更多些，更巩固些。
    我谈谈我个人在这方面的体会。
    首先使我们明显地感到的，是在多种多样的演出中所共同具有的强烈的思想倾向性以及题材的广泛性。每一个优美的演出里，都充满了先进的思想，教导人们要爱人民、爱集体、爱祖国，要善良、正直、坚强和勇敢，要向反动的、反人民的恶势力进行坚决的斗争。而这样深刻的思想教育在舞台上却是通过广泛的题材和各种不同的人物，通过使人信服的（尽管有的是幻想的）故事情节表达出来。没有枯燥的说教，没有刻板的公式，有的只是丰富的生活和人物。从古代的、童话和传说中的、外国的，当然，还有现代的题材中都发射出人民的思想力量和道德力量的光辉。
    音乐剧院在演出剧目中，一方面以新的历史观点和艺术观点重新上演了许多具有高度人民性的古典作品，另一方面更以更多的力量上演了现代作家、音乐家创作的新的反映当代人民斗争生活的剧目，比如“静静的顿河”、“暴风雨”、“塔拉斯一家”、“柳波夫·雅罗瓦娅”、“幸福之岸”等等，在这方面，音乐剧院在苏联是走在最前面的一个。
    这是最好的例证，它告诉我们艺术是怎样为政治服务的，艺术为什么是巨大的重要的思想武器，艺术又是怎样地和人民、和工人阶级紧紧地结合在一起。
    其次，贯串在每一个节目中的社会主义现实主义创作方法，以及由于坚持社会主义现实主义创作方法而必然具有的革新创造精神，我以为是应该给予特殊的注意，应该反复地领会、学习的。
    音乐剧院在这方面的成就，构成了他们在艺术创造上最突出的特点之一。
    我们知道，柴可夫斯基的舞剧“天鹅湖”从上世纪末在彼得堡由列夫·伊万诺夫和马·别季帕二人主持演出后，得到了广泛的欢迎，获得了世界的声誉。自那时以来，他们对于舞剧“天鹅湖”的在舞台上的艺术处理方法便形成了不可逾越的规范。尽管实际上，传统的处理方法还有着脱离柴可夫斯基的真正意图的缺点，却始终未得突破。只有莫斯科音乐剧院的、由伟大的戏剧大师斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基和丹钦科教导出来的艺术家们，才突破了多少年的习惯，大胆地创造性地重新处理了“天鹅湖”（同时他们仍然继承了传统中的真正优美的部分）。他们没有被过去的声誉所吓倒，没有对前辈的成就持有迷信的态度，他们对柴可夫斯基的原作进行了深刻的、严肃的钻研和理解，断然改变了过去舞蹈中某些脱离戏剧情节，脱离人物心理发展，几乎成为余兴性的东西的情况，而突出地强调了故事情节的逻辑发展，清楚地交代了整个舞剧的贯串动作，使得每一幕每一场都成为整个戏的有机组成部分，因之就自然地显现了它的巨大的思想内容，而这一切又都是通过具有鲜明性格的人物的行动表现出来。在这样具有高度思想性的处理下，柴可夫斯基的“天鹅湖”的更健康更美丽的内在的生命力量被充分地发挥出来了。
    新的歌剧“暴风雨”的演出同样具有辉煌的创造精神。聂米罗维奇—丹钦科曾称之为“第一部真正的苏联歌剧，也可以说是苏联歌剧初次有价值的演出”。在这部歌剧中，我们看到了音乐剧院如何运用惯于表现历史传说题材的大歌剧形式，成功地表现了当代人民的斗争生活。革命后的共产党员、游击队员和农民，都出现在歌剧的舞台上；特别令人鼓舞的，是伟大的列宁形象。对于我国新歌剧的创造和地方戏曲表现现代生活的改革来说，“暴风雨”的演出中所体现出来的美学原理，是有着最实际的示范意义的。
    “叶夫根尼·奥湼金”、“巴黎圣母院”、“多瑙河彼岸的萨坡罗什人”以及“阿伊波利特医生”等剧，同样洋溢着青春的艺术活力，处处令人感到思想的深刻，情绪的饱满，处处都是有自己独特风格而又都是与生活紧密相连。音乐剧院的这种创造革新精神，是融会贯串在每一个戏里的。
    在所有的演出中，斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基的表演艺术理论体系都是被忠实地、创造性地执行着，运用着。这说明了各种形式的舞台艺术在其基本原理上是一致的。歌剧、舞剧与话剧同样是为了表现“人”而存在的，斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基的理论原本就是表现
  “人”的理论，因此也就适用于歌剧和舞剧。我想，这些基本原理也是应该适用于中国的各种形式的舞台艺术，从话剧到戏曲，甚至到木偶戏。
    由于这种社会主义现实主义的创造革新精神，音乐剧院光荣地被人称为“革命时代的真正的儿子”。
    在音乐剧院演出中我们所应学习的另一个方面，那就是在艺术创造中所采取极端严肃认真的工作态度和集体主义的精神，以及由此而产生的艺术上的准确性。作为综合艺术，舞台艺术是依靠多种艺术因素共同构成的。其中有主有从，相互间需要以集体的力量作极为准确的配合；稍有一丝一毫的时间的、空间的或力量的差错，便会招致巨大的损失，削弱甚至消除艺术的感染力和说服力。在音乐剧院的所有演出中，我们看到，文学和音乐始终是最必要的前提和基础，而在任何戏剧环境中演员—角色都是整个舞台的主人（但也绝不是“唯我独尊”），其他一切都是围绕着角色的活动而存在，而又共同在导演的统一掌握下相互成为有机的结合。我们看不到哪一部分有非分的突出，哪一部分有懈怠的表现。每一次的演出都是那样地新鲜，就像是第一次演出似的。每一部门，每一角色都是那样地聚精会神，把全部的心灵和生命都投入到音乐与舞蹈之中。每一部门，每一角色都是那样地熟练，运用自如，好像是在辽阔的天地中自由地无拘无束地飞翔，但相互之间却又紧密结合，无懈可击，相辅相成，缺一不可。只有这样，才形成了最高度的综合艺术和集体艺术，才令人在众多的艺术因素齐呈眼前之时而能得到一个协调一致的整体感觉。这种成就，不是经过极为严格的（由于制度所保证的）排练和高度的对艺术工作的集体主义教养、自觉责任心和热爱是不可能做到的。——我以为，对于中国的舞台艺术，这是有很大的启发意义的。
    最后，我觉得我们不能只看到舞台上演出的种种成就，还必须看到舞台后面，看到平常的时刻。很明显：第一，音乐剧院的一切成就，如果缺少了所有人员的为建设社会主义文化而进行的长时期的刻苦的勤修苦练，是不可能想像的。就在访问演出期间，这些已有很高艺术修养的演员，也还每日坚持锻炼。这对于我们某些小有成就就不再进行学习的人来说，应是最好的榜样。第二，音乐剧院如果不是从三十多年前一开始就特别重视新生的青年演员的培养、扶植，充分发挥青年人的朝气蓬勃的不墨守成规的大胆创造精神，则不仅艺术上的成就，就连这众多的优秀演员也是难以产生的。第三，音乐剧院是个年轻的剧院，在短短的几十年中便能达到世界最先进的水平，即在苏联也是最好的艺术单位之一。这，如果没有伟大的社会主义社会的美丽的环境，如果没有伟大的苏联共产党的无限关怀和帮助，更是不可想像的。这种认识，同样使我们也懂得了我们在今天应该如何地珍贵和维护我们伟大的祖国和党和人民的政权，懂得了如何使我们不仅仅醉心钻研在艺术的天地之中，而首先要成为一个积极的和平战士，社会主义的建设者，使我们的祖国很快地也开放出万紫千红的艺术之花！
    我们深深地感谢苏联国立莫斯科斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基和聂米罗维奇—丹钦科音乐剧院的访问演出。
