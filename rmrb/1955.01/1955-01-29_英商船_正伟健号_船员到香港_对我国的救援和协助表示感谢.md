Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 28th: Captain Church and all sixty crew members of the British merchant ship "Zheng Weijian," which was sunk by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit planes in Shantou port, arrived in Guangzhou from Shantou on the 26th with the assistance of our local authorities, and left Guangzhou on the morning of the 27th to return to Hong Kong. They also took with them the ship's radio and other equipment and luggage salvaged by our side.

On the day Captain Church and all the crew members of the "Zheng Weijian" arrived in Guangzhou, they were treated to dinner by the South China Regional Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union.

At the dinner, Church said in his speech: "My ship was sunk by Chiang Kai-shek's planes, and we owe our rescue to the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the port authorities. In Shantou, the local authorities treated us very considerately. On the way to Guangzhou, the staff escorted us very well. Now, in Guangzhou, we have been warmly received by the Seamen's Union. On behalf of myself, all the crew, and our company, I express my gratitude to you." Then, the first mate, Shermud, stood up and said, "Our ship has been attacked by Chiang Kai-shek's planes several times on this route. We will not be frightened by this sinking. We will come to China to do business again." Chief Engineer Howard also spoke, expressing his indignation at Chiang Kai-shek's banditry and his gratitude to our side. After dinner, Church said: "It is difficult for us to do business with China if Taiwan is not liberated. I hope Taiwan will be liberated soon."

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 28th: According to a report in the Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao," Captain L.K. Church of the British merchant ship "Zheng Weijian," which was sunk by Chiang Kai-shek's air force on January 19th, said when he arrived in Hong Kong on the 27th, "It was a deliberate attack. They could see the British flag very clearly, they couldn't have missed the markings." Church also said that the air raid lasted about fifteen minutes, "Their firepower was completely concentrated on our ship."

Church said that when the air raid took place, only the "Zheng Weijian" and another Chinese ship were docked nearby. He said that the planes began to attack the other ship after they had bombed the "Zheng Weijian."

Church said that the Chinese military rescued the "Zheng Weijian," but it could not be steered to shallow water because it sank quickly. He said, "Communist ships approached us and safely took us ashore."

When asked how the Chinese authorities acted during the incident, Church said, "Very well, they did everything for us."

    英商船“正伟健号”船员到香港
    对我国的救援和协助表示感谢
    【新华社广州二十八日电】在汕头港口被蒋贼飞机炸沉的英国商船“正伟健号”的船长邱奇和全体船员一行六十人，在我地方当局协助下，二十六日从汕头到达广州，并已在二十七日上午离广州返香港。他们还带去由我方抢救出来的这条船上的电台及其他器材和行李。
    “正伟健号”船长邱奇和全体船员到达广州的当天，受到中国海员工会华南区委员会设席招待晚餐。
    在晚餐席上，邱奇致词说：“我的船被蒋介石飞机炸沉，全靠中国人民解放军和港务局人员把我们全体船员救出。在汕头，地方当局对我们招待和照顾很周到。在来广州的路上，工作人员护送我们很妥当。现在，在广州又得到海员工会的热情招待。
   我以本人的名义和代表全体船员及我们的公司，向你们表示感谢。”接着，大副舍穆德起来说：“我们的船在这条航线上，曾经受蒋介石飞机的袭击好几次了。我们是不会被这次炸沉吓倒的，我们要再来中国做生意。”轮机长霍华德也发言，表示对蒋贼暴行的愤慨和对我方的感谢。晚餐后，邱奇说：“台湾不解放，我们和中国做生意是有困难的，我希望快些解放台湾。”
    【新华社广州二十八日电】据香港“大公报”报道，一月十九日被蒋贼空军击沉的英国商船“正伟健号”船长勒·克·邱奇在二十七日到达香港时说，“那是故意进行的攻击。他们是可以十分清楚地看到英国国旗的，他们不可能看不见标帜。”邱奇还说，空袭进行了约十五分钟，“他们的火力完全集中在我们的船上”。
    邱奇说，当进行空袭时，在附近只停泊着“正伟健号”和另一艘中国轮船。他说，飞机是在炸中了“正伟健号”以后才开始攻击另一只轮船的。
    邱奇说，中国军方曾搭救“正伟健号”，但是它没有能驶向浅海，因为它下沉很快。他说，“共产党船只驶近我们，把我们平安地送上岸”。
    有人问到，在事件发生过程中，中国当局是怎样行动的，邱奇说，“非常好，他们为我们做了每一件事情”。
