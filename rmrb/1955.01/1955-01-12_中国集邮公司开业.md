    China National Stamp Corporation Opens
    The state-owned China National Stamp Corporation began operations in Beijing on January 10th. The company's mission is to sell various stamps issued by the People's Republic of China since its founding, as well as stamps from fraternal countries; to sell philatelic supplies; to handle the exchange of stamps with fraternal countries and the import and export of stamps to other countries; and to handle mail orders and deposit pre-orders for places outside of Beijing.
    From the founding of the People's Republic of China to the end of last year, a total of fifty-one sets, comprising two hundred and seventy types, of stamps have been issued nationwide. The majority of these stamps reflect the glorious achievements of our country's politics, economy, and culture, and their ideological and artistic qualities are continuously improving. These stamps are not only increasingly popular among the broad masses of the people in our country, but are also welcomed by people of all countries abroad. Chinese stamps have participated in seventeen exhibitions in twelve countries. The establishment of the China National Stamp Corporation will have a positive effect on meeting the needs of philatelists in our country and strengthening international cultural exchanges.
    In addition, the People's Posts and Telecommunications Publishing House will soon publish the monthly magazine "Philately." The purpose of this publication is to introduce the stamps of our country, the Soviet Union, and the people's democratic countries, to introduce philatelic knowledge, and to guide the better development of philatelic activities.

    中国集邮公司开业
    国营中国集邮公司一月十日在北京开始营业。这个公司的任务是出售中华人民共和国开国以来发行的各种邮票和各兄弟国家的邮票；出售集邮用品；办理同各兄弟国家交换邮票以及向其他国家进出口邮票的业务；对外埠，还办理函购和存款预购业务。
    从中华人民共和国成立，到去年年底，全国共发行各种邮票五十一套，二百七十种。这些邮票大部分都反映着我国政治、经济和文化各方面的辉煌成就，思想性和艺术性不断提高。这些邮票不但日益受到国内广大人民的喜爱，在国外也受到了各国人民的欢迎。我国邮票曾先后在十二个国家，参加了十七次展览。中国集邮公司的成立，对于满足我国集邮爱好者的需要，以及加强国际间的文化交流，都将有积极作用。
    另外，人民邮电出版社不久将出版“集邮”月刊。这个刊物的任务是介绍我国、苏联和各人民民主国家的邮票，介绍集邮常识，指导更好地开展集邮活动。　（马然）
