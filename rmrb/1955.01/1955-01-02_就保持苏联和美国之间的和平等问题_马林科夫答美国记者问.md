Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 1st: The following is the reply of G.M. Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, to questions raised by Mr. Charles Edward Shutt.

Mr. Charles Edward Shutt, Chief of the "Telegraphic Communications Agency" Washington Bureau, raised several questions to G.M. Malenkov.

Below are the questions from Mr. Charles Edward Shutt and the replies from G.M. Malenkov.

Q: What is the best way to maintain peace between our two countries?

A: Maintaining peace between the Soviet Union and the United States requires, first and foremost, that both sides sincerely desire peace and work towards it, and that they proceed in their relations from the possibility and necessity of mutual peaceful coexistence and from considerations of their legitimate common interests.

As for the Soviet Union, proceeding from the above-mentioned premise, it is willing to continue to do everything in its power to ensure lasting and solid peaceful relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, and to resolve existing differences, provided that the United States of America also expresses the same willingness.

Q: What do you consider to be the main reasons for the tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States?

A: The main reason for the tensions in the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States is that certain American figures are adopting a policy of rebuilding the revanchist West German army, engaging in an arms race, and establishing a network of American military bases around the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries, a policy that can only be regarded as preparing for a new war.

Everyone knows that at present, due to the fault of the Western countries that concluded the London and Paris agreements, the threat to peace is increasing and the danger of war is growing.

In order to eliminate the tensions in the relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, and in order to lay a solid foundation for the smooth development of peaceful cooperation between our two countries, it is necessary to abolish the policy aimed at reviving German militarism, which once brought immeasurable disasters to mankind, to stop the arms race, and to end the policy of surrounding peace-loving countries with military bases.

Q: Would you welcome diplomatic negotiations to resolve existing differences in the Far East?

A: Yes. Negotiations between the countries concerned to resolve several issues in the Far East should be welcomed. The experience of the Geneva Conference, with the participation of the People's Republic of China and other countries, proves that such negotiations can produce favorable results.

Q: What are your views on international control of atomic weapons, and do you think an effective plan acceptable to all parties concerned can be formulated?

A: The Soviet Union's attitude towards the issue of atomic weapons is known to all. The Soviet Union advocates the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons, the complete elimination of atomic weapons from the armaments of all countries, and the establishment of strict international supervision to monitor the implementation of a corresponding agreement.

Other countries should be as concerned as the Soviet Union in prohibiting atomic weapons and eliminating the threat of atomic war.

Q: Would you welcome diplomatic negotiations to facilitate a meeting of the heads of government of France, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States?

A: On this issue, I would first like to mention that recently, the United States, Britain, and France have done everything possible to preclude the possibility of resolving the issue of a meeting of the heads of government of the four countries in a positive way. Everyone knows that the Western three countries are trying to unilaterally resolve major international issues, first and foremost the issue of Germany. Isn't it clear that it is impossible to pursue such a policy while simultaneously creating illusions about four-power talks among the people?

Therefore, the issue is that the heads of government of France, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States should not be presented with the fait accompli of unilateral decisions on these or those issues that need to be studied by a four-power conference.

Q: Do you have any words for the American people?

A: I extend my heartfelt greetings to the American people and wish them a happy New Year.

The foundation for developing and consolidating the friendship between the peoples of the United States of America and the Soviet Union exists. I am confident that the American people will make their valuable contribution to the great and noble cause of consolidating international peace.

Now the people of all countries must be especially vigilant against all kinds of conspiracies by aggressive blocs.

At present, there is no task more important than the task of uniting the forces of the people of all countries in order to guarantee peace and international security.

    就保持苏联和美国之间的和平等问题
    马林科夫答美国记者问
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科一日电：以下是苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫对查尔斯·爱德华·萧特先生提出的问题的答复。
    “电讯通讯社”华盛顿分社社长查尔斯·爱德华·萧特先生向格·马·马林科夫提出了若干问题。
    下面是查尔斯·爱德华·萧特先生的问题和格·马·马林科夫的答复。
    问：怎样才能最好地保持我们两国之间的和平？
    答：保持苏联和美国之间的和平，首先要求双方真诚地希望和平并且为它而努力，要求它们在它们的关系中从互相和平共处的可能性和必要性以及它们正当的共同利益的考虑出发。
    至于苏联，它从以上所说的前提出发，愿意继续尽它的一切力量来保证苏联和美国之间的持久的和巩固的和平关系，来解决现存的分歧，只要美利坚合众国方面也表示同样的意愿。
    问：您认为苏联和美国之间的紧张局势的主要原因是什么？
    答：苏联和美国之间的关系中的紧张局势的主要原因是某些美国人士正在采取重建复仇主义的西德军队、进行军备竞赛以及在苏联和其他爱好和平的国家的周围建立美国军事基地网的方针，这种方针只能被认为是准备新战争。
    人人都知道，在目前，由于缔结了伦敦和巴黎协定的西方国家的过错，对和平的威胁正在增加，战争的危险正在增长。
    为了消除苏联和美国的关系中的紧张局势，为了为我们两国之间的和平合作的顺利发展奠定巩固的基础，必须废除目的在于复活曾经给人类带来不可估计的灾难的德国军国主义的方针，停止军备竞赛，结束用军事基地包围爱好和平的国家的政策。
    问：您欢迎举行关于解决远东的现存分歧的外交谈判吗？
    答：是的。应该欢迎在有关国家之间举行解决若干远东问题的谈判。有中华人民共和国和其他国家一同参加的日内瓦会议的经验证明：这种谈判会产生有利的结果。
    问：您对于国际管制原子武器问题有什么意见，您认为可以为所有有关方面接受的有效的计划能够制订得出来吗？
    答：苏联对原子武器问题的态度是大家都知道的。苏联主张无条件禁止原子武器，主张从各国军备中完全取消原子武器，并且主张建立严格的国际监督来监督一个相应的协议的执行。
    在禁止原子武器和消除原子战争的威胁方面，其他国家应该同苏联一样关切。
    问：您欢迎举行促成一次法国、英国、苏联和美国政府的首脑的会议的外交谈判吗？
    答：在这个问题上，我要首先提到的是：最近，美国、英国和法国方面已经做了一切事情来排除从积极方面解决四国政府首脑举行会议问题的可能性。大家知道，西方三国正在试图片面地解决重大的国际问题，首先是关于德国的问题。不可能一面奉行这样一种政策，而同时又在人民中间造成关于四国会谈的幻想，难道还不清楚吗？
    因此，问题在于：不应该把关于需要由四国会议研究的这些或那些问题的片面决定的既成事实摆在法国、英国、苏联和美国的政府首脑的会议的面前。
    问：对于美国人民，您有什么话要说吗？
    答：我向美国人民致衷心的问候，并祝贺他们新年快乐。
    发展和巩固美利坚合众国和苏联两国人民之间的友谊的基础是存在着的。我确信美国人民将对巩固国际和平的伟大而崇高的事业作出他们的有价值的贡献。
    现在各国人民都必须特别警惕侵略集团的各种各样的阴谋。
    目前，再没有什么任务比为了保障和平和国际安全而团结各国人民的力量的任务更为重要的了。
