Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 21st: The Indian National Congress (INC) annual meeting is scheduled to be held from the 21st to the 23rd in Awadi, near Madras.

According to the Press Trust of India: In a report submitted to the INC National Committee prior to the meeting, the outgoing INC President Nehru discussed the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. He said, "These five principles have been agreed upon by us and other countries. This coexistence is not merely the absence of war and conflict, but also recognizes that each country should live its own life without interfering in other countries, and should adopt a friendly attitude towards other countries, even if they differ from each other in many ways."

Nehru said that the Asian-African Conference scheduled to be held in Indonesia in April "is not directed against any other country or group of countries, nor is it intended to form any bloc. It represents a demand for self-expression, and the desire of these countries to better understand and cooperate with each other in accomplishing their common major tasks. To accomplish these tasks, peace is an urgent need."

Regarding the Portuguese territories in India, Nehru said that these places "must be incorporated into India; they are an integral part of India, and nothing can make them indifferent to us." He said that India "cannot tolerate a part of Indian territory being ruled by colonial countries." Nehru also expressed his disagreement with the racial discrimination policy pursued by the Union of South Africa.

Prior to the annual meeting, the INC Steering Committee drafted a formal resolution for the INC annual meeting on the 17th. The resolution on foreign affairs stated: The INC is pleased to learn of the satisfactory work of the International Supervisory and Control Commissions in Indochina and hopes that "there will be no foreign interference and pressure, and that the future of these countries will be decided by the people themselves, as stipulated in the Geneva Accords."

The resolution stated, "The establishment of peace in Korea is extremely important for peace in Asia and the world." "The INC hopes that further measures will be taken to continue negotiations in order to peacefully resolve the Korean issue."

The resolution expressed regret over the establishment of the Manila Treaty Organization and emphasized that the establishment of this group "increases insecurity in the region." The resolution stated that true peace can only be established through friendly cooperation and understanding between countries. The resolution also welcomed the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

The resolution stated, "It is regrettable that China continues to be excluded from the United Nations." The resolution expressed a warm hope that in 1955 China will obtain its position in the United Nations.

    在印度国大党年会举行前夕
    尼赫鲁提出关于国内和国际问题的报告
    【新华社新德里二十一日电】印度国大党年会订于二十一日到二十三日在马德拉斯附近的阿瓦迪举行。
    据印度新闻处报道：前任国大党主席尼赫鲁在会前提交国大党全国委员会的报告中谈到和平共处的五项原则。他说，“这五项原则是我们和其他国家所共同商定的。这种共处不仅仅是不发生战争和冲突，并且还承认，各国应该过它自己的生活，而不干涉其他国家，并且应该对其他国家采取友好态度，即使它们彼此在许多方面有所差异。”
    尼赫鲁说，订于四月间在印度尼西亚举行的亚非会议“并不是针对任何其他国家或国家集团的，也不打算成立任何集团。它代表一种自我表示意见的要求，以及这些国家希望在完成它们共同的重大任务中更好地彼此了解和相互合作的愿望。为了完成这些任务，和平是迫切的需要。”
    关于葡萄牙在印度的属地，尼赫鲁说，这些地方“必须并入印度，它们是印度的组成部分，任何事情都不能使它们和我们漠不相关。”他说，印度“不能容忍印度的一部分土地受殖民国家的统治”。尼赫鲁还表示不同意南非联邦所奉行的种族歧视政策。
    在年会举行前，国大党指导委员会十七日草拟了国大党年会的正式决议。关于外交问题的决议说：国大党很高兴知道了在印度支那的国际监督和监察委员会的令人满意的工作，希望“不会有外来的干涉和压力，并且如日内瓦协定中所规定的，这些国家的前途将由人民自己来加以决定”。
    决议说，“在朝鲜建立和平对于亚洲和世界的和平是极为重要的”。“国大党希望采取进一步措施继续进行谈判，以便和平解决朝鲜问题。”
    决议对马尼拉条约集团的建立表示遗憾，并强调说，这个集团的建立“增加了这个地区的不安全”。决议说，真正的和平只有通过各国间的友好合作和了解的办法才能够建立。决议并表示欢迎和平共处的五项原则。
    决议说，“中国继续被排斥在联合国以外是很令人遗憾的”。决议表示热烈希望在一九五五年中国将取得它在联合国的地位。
    考虑到原子弹和氢弹试验引起的危险和关于使用它们的威胁，决议强调说，“完全禁止制造和使用原子弹、氢弹和其他大规模毁灭性武器以及原子大炮等常规的原子武器，是非常迫切的事情。”
