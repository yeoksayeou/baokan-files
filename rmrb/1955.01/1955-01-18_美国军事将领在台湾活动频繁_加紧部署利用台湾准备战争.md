    US Military Generals Frequently Active in Taiwan
    Intensifying Deployment to Use Taiwan to Prepare for War
    [Xinhua News Agency, 17th] Recently, US military generals have been frequently active in Taiwan. News reports indicate that following the signing of the US-Chiang Treaty, the US military authorities are intensifying their deployment to use Taiwan for war preparations.

    Following the visit of Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford, US Army Vice Chief of Staff Bolte visited Taiwan from the 14th to the 16th. According to reports, Bolte's activities are related to plans to further strengthen the US military presence in Taiwan. This plan aims to expand the size of the US Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan. Currently, personnel from this US military advisory group have penetrated down to the Chiang bandit army's regimental level. After the expansion of the US military advisory group, a large number of US officers will be deployed to train and control the Chiang bandit army down to the battalion and even company level. At the same time, this plan also stipulates strengthening liaison work between the US military and the Chiang bandit army, and consolidating the liaison organizations of various US military units stationed in Taiwan.

    Commander of the US Far East Air Force Logistics Command Rusto and Commander of the US Air Force Logistics Group stationed in the Philippines, Summs, also arrived in Taiwan on the 16th. US Navy Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Logistics Goode is also scheduled to visit Taiwan in late January. According to reports, the plan studied by Bolte is related to strengthening the Chiang bandit army's logistics organization. The activities of these US logistics officers are to strengthen the US logistical supply work using Taiwan as a base for aggression.

    At the same time, news also reveals that the US Pacific Command has dispatched a "Manpower Survey Team" to Taiwan to estimate Taiwan's "ability" to provide cannon fodder to the United States.

    美国军事将领在台湾活动频繁
    加紧部署利用台湾准备战争
    【新华社十七日讯】最近，美国军事将领在台湾活动频繁。从透露的消息可以看出，在美蒋条约签订以后，美国军事当局正在加紧利用台湾进行战争准备的部署。
    继美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福之后，美国陆军副参谋长包尔特从十四日到十六日访问了台湾。据消息报道，包尔特的活动和进一步加强美国在台湾的军事机构的计划有关。这个计划是要扩大美国驻台湾的军事援助顾问团的规模，现在，这个美国军事顾问团的人员已经深入到蒋贼军的团一级。美国军事顾问团扩大以后，将调来大批美国军官来训练和控制蒋贼军营一级以至每个连级。同时，这个计划还规定加强美军和蒋贼军的连络工作，把美国各军事单位驻台湾的连络机构集中起来。
    美国远东空军后勤司令鲁斯托、美国空军派驻菲律宾的后勤联队队长桑姆斯，也在十六日到达台湾。美国海军作战部负责后勤事宜的副部长古德也将在一月下旬到台湾活动。据报道，包尔特所研究的那个计划，就和加强蒋贼军的后勤机构有关。这些美国后勤工作军官的活动，是为了加强美国以台湾为侵略基地的后勤供应工作。
    同时，还有消息透露，美国太平洋司令部已派遣“人力调查团”到台湾，以便估计台湾向美国提供炮灰的“能力”。
