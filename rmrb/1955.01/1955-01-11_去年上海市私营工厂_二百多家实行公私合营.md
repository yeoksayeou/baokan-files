　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 9th: In 1954, capitalists from more than 1,900 factories in Shanghai applied to the People's Government for joint operation. Among them, 184 enterprises, comprising 217 factories, were approved and implemented joint public-private ownership. Their total output value accounted for approximately 20% of the total output value of private industry in the city. These included enterprises in heavy industries such as steel smelting, copper casting, sand casting, electrical equipment, machinery manufacturing, electricity, kiln industry, and cement; as well as enterprises in light industries such as cotton spinning, dyeing and weaving, knitting, rubber, paper making, pharmaceuticals, household chemicals, and canned food. Most were larger in scale and had more complete equipment.

　　From the time the more than 200 factories began preparing for joint operation, their workers welcomed the joint public-private ownership with actions to improve production. During the factory's joint operation process, the workshops and groups of the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory established quality targets and improved product quality. All workers, staff, and engineers in the factory worked hard to increase production and practice economy. Even the boiler workers created a new record of burning seven catties and four taels of water per catty of coal. The factories that implemented joint operation before the third quarter of last year established factory management committees under the leadership of public shareholders’ representatives, and workers' representatives participated in the management of the enterprises. In these factories, systems such as production responsibility, production plans, and production meetings were also gradually established. In addition, these factories established and improved organizations such as departments, offices, and workshops according to production needs, changing the situation in capitalist enterprises of emphasizing business but not production.

　　After the implementation of joint public-private ownership, these more than 200 factories made greater contributions to national construction and people's lives. The public-private joint ventures under the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Heavy Industry Bureau successfully manufactured dozens of important new products in 1954, including automatic recording pressure gauges and temperature gauges for Anshan Iron and Steel Company, double-barrel machine tool microscopes for Harbin Electric Meter and Instrument Factory, and high-speed semi-automatic lathes for the former Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company. Many extremely important new products were manufactured according to the designs of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and other countries. The nine cotton spinning mills under the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Textile Industry Bureau, which implemented joint operation earlier, saved more cotton per yarn spun in November of last year compared to before the joint operation, which, if spun into yarn and woven into cloth, could make three or four more single garments. According to the purchasing personnel of the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, the on-time, quality, and quantity delivery of goods by the joint public-private factories was better than before the implementation of joint public-private ownership.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 8th: Some capitalists of small and medium-sized private factories in Shanghai have applied to the People's Government to merge their factories into large joint public-private enterprises that have been in operation for a longer time. A total of eight factories have been approved for merger by the government last year and this year. The private Jiang Quantai Iron Factory, with eighteen employees, was approved by the People's Government on January 1st this year to merge into the Zhonghua Shipyard, which has been implementing joint public-private ownership for more than two years, and became an anchor chain workshop. With the approval of the People's Government, the private Kailing Motor Factory merged into the Huatong Switch Factory, which has been implementing joint public-private ownership for five years, in the fourth quarter of last year, and also became a professional workshop. In the past, most of the motors produced by the Kailing Motor Factory were outdated and could not meet the needs of national construction. Since merging into the Huatong Switch Factory, new-style switches have been manufactured. Last year, 31 private factories in Shanghai with production links underwent merger and reorganization and implemented joint public-private ownership. For example, the Zhongfang Spinning Factory, which could only spin yarn, and the Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory and Dawei Printing and Dyeing Weaving Factory, which could only weave and dye, were merged and implemented joint public-private ownership and have become an all-round textile printing and dyeing factory with more than 4,000 employees.

### 去年上海市私营工厂  二百多家实行公私合营

    去年上海市私营工厂
    二百多家实行公私合营
    【新华社上海九日电】　一九五四年上海市有一千九百多家工厂的资本家向人民政府申请合营，其中得到批准并实行了公私合营的有一百八十四家企业的二百十七个工厂，它们的生产总值约相当于全市私营工业总产值的百分之二十左右。它们之中有钢铁冶炼、铜料冶铸、翻砂制造、电工器材、机器制造、电力、窑业、水泥等重工业方面的企业；也有棉纺、染织、针织、橡胶、造纸、制药、家用化学、罐头食品等轻工业方面的企业，大部分规模较大，设备较齐全。
    这两百多家工厂的职工，从工厂开始筹备合营的时候起，就以搞好生产的行动，迎接公私合营。大中华橡胶厂各车间各小组在工厂合营过程中，都订立了质量指标，提高了产品质量。全厂工人、职员、工程师都努力增产节约，就是烧锅炉的工人也创造了一斤煤烧七斤四两水的新纪录。在去年第三季度以前实行合营的工厂，在公股代表领导下，相继成立了工厂管理委员会，工人的代表参加了企业的经营管理。在这些工厂里，生产责任制、生产计划、生产会议等制度也逐步建立起来。此外，这些工厂还都根据生产需要，建立和健全了科、室、车间等组织，改变了资本主义企业的重视营业不重视生产的情况。
    这两百多个工厂实行公私合营以后，对国家建设和人民生活作了更多贡献。上海市人民政府重工业管理局所属的公私合营厂，一九五四年制造成功数十种重要的新产品，其中有给鞍山钢铁公司制造的能自动纪录的压力表、温度表，给哈尔滨电表仪器厂制造的双筒机工显微镜，给前中苏造船公司制造的高速半自动车床等。许多极重要的新产品是按照苏联、捷克斯洛伐克等国的式样制造的。上海市人民政府纺织工业管理局所属的九个合营较早的棉纺厂，去年十一月份比合营前每纺一件纱节省的棉花，如纺成纱织成布，就可多做三、四套单衣。据中国花纱布公司上海采购供应站的采购人员反映：各公私合营厂按期、按质、按量交货的情况，都比实行公私合营以前好。
    【新华社上海八日电】　上海有些中、小型私营工厂的资本家，向人民政府申请把他们的工厂合并到合营较久的大型公私合营企业中去。在去年和今年已经政府批准合并的共有八家。有十八个职工的私营蒋全泰铁厂，今年一月一日得到人民政府批准，合并到已经实行公私合营两年多的中华造船厂，成为一个锚链工场。私营开灵马达厂经人民政府批准，在去年第四季度并入实行公私合营已经五年的华通开关厂，也成为一个专业工场。过去，开灵马达厂生产的马达大部分规格陈旧，不能适应国家建设的需要，并入华通开关厂以来，已制造出新式的开关。去年，上海还有三十一家生产上有联系的私营工厂，经过合并改组后实行了公私合营。例如：只能纺纱的中纺纱厂和只能织染的达丰染织厂、大纬印染织造厂等三家工厂合并并实行公私合营后，已成为拥有四千多职工的全能纺织印染工厂。
