Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, January 15th: The Polish aircraft manufacturing industry has now completely mastered the production of jet aircraft, according to a report from the Polish Press Agency, Warsaw, on the 14th. Poland can now produce all components of jet aircraft using domestically produced raw materials. This was stated by Mr. Nawrocki, a person in charge of the Polish aircraft manufacturing industry, to a reporter from "Warsaw Life Daily".

Nawrocki said: Before liberation, the development of Poland's aircraft manufacturing industry was limited, and it was completely dependent on foreign imports for the parts and instruments needed to manufacture aircraft. When the German fascists retreated, they completely destroyed the few aircraft factories in Poland. After liberation, we needed to rebuild everything from the ruins. At first, we could only manufacture trainer aircraft.

Nawrocki said: The reason we have achieved such success is due to the great help from the Soviet Union. Experienced aircraft manufacturing workers from the Soviet Union gave us various kinds of assistance. Learning from them is the decisive factor in our success.

    波兰飞机制造业掌握了喷气飞机的生产
    【新华社十五日讯】据波兰通讯社华沙十四日讯：波兰飞机制造业现在已经完全掌握了喷气飞机的生产。波兰现在已经可以用本国出产的原材料生产喷气式飞机的一切组成部分。这是波兰飞机制造业的一位负责人纳夫罗茨基对“华沙生活报”记者说的。
    纳夫罗茨基说：在解放前，波兰飞机制造业的发展是有限的，它完全依赖外国输入制造飞机所需要的机件和仪器。德国法西斯侵略者在撤退的时候，他们把波兰少数几个飞机工厂完全破坏了。到解放后，我们需要从废墟中重新建设起一切。起初，我们还只能制造教练机。
    纳夫罗茨基说：我们之所以取得现在这样的成就是由于得到苏联的巨大帮助。苏联有经验的飞机制造工作者给了我们各种帮助。向他们学习就是我们取得成就的决定性因素。
