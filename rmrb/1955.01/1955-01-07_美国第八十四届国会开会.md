    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 6th: According to TASS, the Eighty-Fourth Congress of the United States held its first session on January 5th.

    As everyone knows, the results of the November 2, 1954 elections gave the Democratic Party control of both houses of Congress, albeit by a slim majority. Currently, in the Senate, the Democrats hold 48 seats, the Republicans hold 47 seats, and Independent Senator Morse has announced that he will vote with the Democrats. In the House of Representatives, the Democrats hold 232 seats, and the Republicans hold 203 seats.

    With a majority in both houses, the Democrats have the right to determine the members of the Congressional committees, to appoint the chairmen of these committees, and to control the passage of bills through them. They can also propose amendments to the legislative program submitted to Congress for approval by the Eisenhower administration. This creates a situation where whether Congress supports the government's legislative program depends on the relationship between the Democrats and the Republicans.

    Observers believe that the new distribution of power in Congress will not cause any significant changes in American domestic and foreign policies. As soon as the election results were announced, prominent figures in the Democratic Party declared that the Democratic majority in Congress would act in the spirit of "genuine bipartisan principles."

    An Associated Press correspondent in Washington recently wrote about the new distribution of power in Congress: "There is a consensus among most leaders of the two parties... that powerful behind-the-scenes factors will promote at least moderate cooperation on most issues."

    As in the past, the most powerful group in Congress remains the reactionary alliance of Democratic congressmen from the Southern states with Republican congressmen from the Midwestern and New England states. The influence of Democratic congressmen from the Southern states, especially Texas, has greatly increased. Preliminary materials on the members of the Congressional committees show that eight of the fifteen Senate committees and nine of the nineteen House committees are led by Democratic congressmen from the Southern states. Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas was elected as the Senate Majority Leader, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives is Sam Rayburn of Texas.

    Eisenhower will submit eight messages to Congress within January, outlining his government's program. According to American newspapers, Congress will first review and approve the London and Paris Agreements, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization treaty, the recently signed US-Chiang treaty, the expansion of the reserve forces, and the issue of "military aid" to foreign countries. It is speculated that the discussion of these issues will not cause any major disagreements, because, as a United Press International correspondent in Washington pointed out, the government and the Democratic Party hold the same views on foreign policy and military issues.

    As for the Republican Party's domestic policy, informed sources believe that this program is no different from last year's. As in the past, the vast majority of the national budget will be used for military purposes, while the expenses for the people's social needs will account for only a negligible portion. High tax rates and large-scale persecution of progressive people will continue as before.

    Past experience has shown that the Republican and Democratic parties usually only disagree on unimportant issues. On some major issues, the Republican and Democratic parties have always been completely in step, because their backers are all American monopoly capital.

### 美国第八十四届国会开会

    美国第八十四届国会开会
   【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社华盛顿讯：美国第八十四届国会在一月五日举行第一次会议。
    大家知道，一九五四年十一月二日的选举结果使民主党控制了国会两院，虽然仅是微弱的多数。现在在参议院中，民主党占四十八席，共和党占四十七席，无党派参议员莫尔斯已经宣布将同民主党人一起投票。在众议院中，民主党占二百三十二席，共和党占二百零三席。
    民主党人在两院既然拥有多数，他们就有权来决定国会各委员会的成员，来任命这些委员会的主席并通过他们来掌握各项法案的通过，还可以对艾森豪威尔政府提交国会批准的立法计划提出修改。这样一来就形成了这样一种局面：国会是否支持政府的立法计划，要看民主党人和共和党人之间的关系如何。
    据观察家认为，国会中力量的新的分配不会在美国对内和对外政策上造成任何显著的改变。选举结果刚一揭晓的时候，民主党中的著名人物就宣布说，国会中的民主党多数将本着“真正两党原则”的精神来行事。
    美联社驻华盛顿记者最近谈到国会中力量的新分配时写道：“在两党大多数领导人物中具有一致的意见……他们认为有力的幕后因素将促进在大多数问题上至少是适度的合作。”
    和过去一样，国会中势力最大的集团仍然是南部各州的民主党议员同中西部各州和新英格兰的共和党议员的反动联盟。南部各州、特别是得克萨斯州的民主党议员的影响大大加强了。关于国会两院各委员会成员的初步材料表明，参议院的十五个委员会中有八个，众议院的十九个委员会中有九个，是南部各州的民主党议员领导的。得克萨斯州的约翰逊被选为参议院多数党的领袖，众议院议长是得克萨斯州的雷朋。
    艾森豪威尔将在一月份内向国会提出八个咨文，发表他的政府的施政纲领。据美国报纸消息，国会将首先审查批准伦敦和巴黎协定、东南亚军事集团条约、不久以前签订的美蒋条约的问题、扩建后备军的问题和对外国实行“军事援助”的问题。据推测，这些问题的讨论将不会引起什么重大的分歧，因为正如合众社驻华盛顿记者指出的，在外交政策和军事问题方面，政府和民主党的观点是一致的。
    至于共和党的国内政策，消息灵通人士认为，这次的纲领和去年的毫无不同之处。和过去一样，国家预算中绝大部分将用于军事方面，而用于人民的社会需要的费用只占微不足道的一部分。仍将和以前一样地保持高的税额和大举迫害进步人士等等。
    过去的经验表明，共和党和民主党之间，通常只在那些无关紧要的问题上产生分歧。在一些主要问题上，共和党和民主党始终是步调完全一致的，因为它们的靠山都是美国垄断资本。
