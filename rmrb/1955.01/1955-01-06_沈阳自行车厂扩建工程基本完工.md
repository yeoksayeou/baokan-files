The Shenyang Bicycle Factory Expansion Project Basically Completed

After a year of expansion, the Shenyang Bicycle Factory has basically completed all its construction except for a small portion of the ventilation equipment that is still being installed, and has put everything into production. The newly built production workshop of more than 5,500 square meters has been equipped with new equipment, heating, lighting, and dust removal devices. The expanded factory can now produce 180 bicycles per day (and will eventually produce 400 bicycles per day). There have been many new improvements in the technical equipment of the workshop. Automatic polishing machines with individual drives have appeared in the electroplating workshop, and electrical equipment has been installed in the heat treatment section, which used to be smoky and fiery. A large three-story finished product warehouse and assembly workshop has been erected in the western part of the factory, equipped with elevators to transport finished products. In addition, the factory has living rooms, shower rooms, a newly built spacious staff canteen, a health clinic, and a nursery. In the second quarter, the factory will produce new men's coaster brake bicycles. (Report from our reporter station in Liaoning)
