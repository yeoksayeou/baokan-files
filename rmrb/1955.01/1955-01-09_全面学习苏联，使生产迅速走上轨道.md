    Fully Learn from the Soviet Union to Get Production on Track Quickly
    The General Branch Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory
    The rebuilt Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory, from surveying and design to construction and production, operates in accordance with the design documents stipulated by the Soviet Design Institute. The Soviet Union's design requirements for this factory are: to carry out comprehensive planning entirely in accordance with the scale and requirements of a socialist pneumatic tool factory, to strictly adhere to socialist design principles in every aspect of factory construction, and to embody the requirements of socialist enterprise production in every way. Under these circumstances, the basic task before the Party organization is to politically and organizationally ensure that these requirements are fully realized in the shortest possible time.
    Before the reconstruction, the Pneumatic Tool Factory was a factory that only produced three relatively simple pneumatic tools, with no unified operating procedures, no strict quality standards, and no scientific management system. After the reconstruction, the main equipment is Soviet, the product variety is several times greater than before, and the technology is much more complex. Furthermore, the product specifications and requirements, process flow, production organization and management, and even the storage of tools and maintenance of equipment, are all based on the latest achievements of Soviet pneumatic tool factories. This is unfamiliar to our existing management cadres, technicians, and workers. Therefore, to realize the Soviet design requirements, we must fully learn from the Soviet Union, learn from the Soviet Union's advanced technical experience, advanced management experience, as well as the excellent working methods and style of Soviet comrades.
    To fully learn from the Soviet Union, we must start by studying the technical design documents. However, for a considerable period, we did not realize this. Some of us believed that using the original workers, the original organizational structure, and the original management methods would also meet the Soviet design requirements. In addition, the technical design documents were treated as "secret" materials and blocked off, so there was no leadership and organization of all employees to study the design documents. Therefore, although we shouted "Learn from the Soviet Union" every day, we were not clear about "what to learn" and "how to learn." For example, the general branch committee's work plan for May and June of last year mentioned "strengthening ideological leadership, comprehensively carrying out learning from the Soviet Union, and promoting advanced experience..." and also mentioned "organizing workers to study Soviet machine tool manuals and technical operating procedures." However, the plan only required the trade union to "continue to carry out mass-based production innovation movements, learn from Soviet advanced experience, and implement Soviet expert suggestions." In reality, workers were not organized to study machine tool manuals and technical operating procedures. The work plan for the third quarter of last year mentioned "vigorously carrying out technical innovation in a planned and prepared manner throughout the factory...launching a climax of learning and promoting Soviet advanced experience..." What is meant here by "climax" and "comprehensive" learning from the Soviet Union? It mainly refers to several advanced tool methods and the implementation of certain specific suggestions from experts.
    Because the work of learning from the Soviet Union was only limited to promoting certain Soviet advanced work methods and implementing specific suggestions from experts in daily work, although there has been some progress in the past year, for example, more than 90 percent of the lathe operators in the mechanical assembly workshop have applied advanced cutting experience on more than 100 lathes, increasing efficiency by one to seven times; and after implementing more than 400 specific suggestions from experts, the workers' technical level and production quantity and quality have improved, this still cannot solve the fundamental problems in production and management. The most serious problem is that some equipment cannot be started immediately after installation. Advanced labor organizations have not been implemented, and the production cycle is too long. Some equipment that can be started is not understood by the workers in terms of its performance and operating procedures, resulting in many accidents, low efficiency, and even many jokes. Many problems were clarified in the Soviet design documents, but we still treated them as "key" issues in the workshop. For example, the cylinder body component of the heavy-duty rock drill, the workshop wrote on a large propaganda slogan "Concentrate efforts to break through the key of the cylinder body," and shouted it for more than 20 days, but the waste products were still waste products. Later, when the Soviet operating procedures were taken out of the drawer, it was found that it was because the production was not carried out according to the procedures.
    Because of these reasons, the production quantity and quality cannot meet the requirements. The labor quotas stipulated in the design documents, such as the KM-4 rock drill, require 307 hours per machine according to the design requirements, but we are currently doing it in 416 hours, a difference of 109 hours. The lightweight rock drill requires 39.99 hours according to the design requirements, but now it is 49.36 hours. The KM-5 riveter requires 14.72 hours according to the design requirements, but now it is 29.28 hours, a difference of about 15 hours per machine. Among them, a Soviet-style rock drill that began mass production in 1952 requires a labor quota of 42.985 hours according to the design requirements, but even now, we still have to use 46 hours to produce it. None of the eight different types of products we currently manufacture meet the design requirements in terms of quality.
    Because there was no clear requirement to implement the Soviet technical design documents, the technical innovation movement went astray. The workshop vigorously promoted "labor competition with technical innovation as the main content," but the leadership did not point out the direction of technical innovation to the employees. Many employees buried themselves in research and invention in the office or workshop, and as a result, the atmosphere of learning from the Soviet Union became weak. Some technicians spend all day in the office thinking about designing and creating: "Chinese-style riveters," "Shenyang-style riveters," actively designing multi-hole drills that our factory does not need to produce. Some workers also hold the idea that "it is more glorious to create your own than to learn from others," and do not understand the efficiency of machine tools, and mess up innovation, which will damage the new machine tools and put production in a state of chaos and great difficulty.
    There are many such examples. After the lessons of this series of specific facts, and due to the enlightenment of several reports from the superior party committee and administrative leaders, in October 1954, the general party branch committee became clear that it must fully learn from the Soviet Union and implement the Soviet design requirements. This also formed a turning point in our leadership work.
    The Party organization accepted the serious lessons of the past, and timely supervised the administration to make a "Implementation of Soviet Design Requirements" plan in October, and has arranged specific plans to start making up for the preparatory work for production technology. This plan starts from January 1 this year. The learning policy determined by the general branch committee is: to rely closely on the guidance of Soviet experts, to learn from scratch, to learn what to do, to implement the method of combining theory with practice, and to strictly carry out production in accordance with the technical design documents.
    The work of fully learning from the Soviet Union is arduous and complex, and to carry out this work, we must first strengthen the Party's ideological work and overcome the resistance of various backward ideas. This is a process of struggle between socialist ideology and capitalist ideology.
    According to the current ideological investigation and analysis of the factory's cadres and workers by the general branch committee, it is necessary to overcome conservative ideas and empiricism. Some people are unwilling to "discard the old and replace it with the new," and want to use handicraft methods to manage new enterprises. In offices and workshops, there are words like: "The Soviet Union is a socialist society, we are a new democratic society, how can we meet their requirements!" "The Soviet Union has 37 years, we only have 5 years, how can we catch up!" Some people also show off their old "qualifications" and say: "The Soviet Union has 30 years of experience, I have 20 years of experience." Some workers believe that with their own experience, they can complete the task without following the process regulations. Some people think that their work has been done well: "We can now produce several new types of products, isn't that much better than repairing and assembling one type of product in the past?" For example, when organizing workers to study Soviet machine tool manuals, only 20 to 30 workers in the factory signed up to participate.
    These conservative and complacent ideas are really the main obstacles to fully learning from the Soviet Union and implementing the requirements of the Soviet technical design documents. The general branch committee has begun to strengthen the political and ideological leadership of employees, from inside the Party to outside the Party, first the leaders then the masses, first the cadres then the workers, mobilizing, discussing and criticizing at all levels, and resolutely ensuring the establishment of an honest and diligent learning attitude, so that production can quickly get on track and make a significant contribution to the country's socialist industrialization.

    全面学习苏联，使生产迅速走上轨道
    中共沈阳风动工具厂总支委员会
    改建的沈阳风动工具厂，从勘查、设计到施工以及生产等一系列工作，都是按照苏联设计学院规定的设计文件来进行的。苏联对这个工厂设计的要求是：完全按照社会主义的风动工具厂的规模和要求来进行全面规划，工厂建设中的每一件工作都要严格按照社会主义设计原则办事，处处都要体现社会主义企业生产的要求。在这样情况下，摆在党组织面前的基本任务就是从政治上组织上保证这些要求在尽可能短的时间内完满实现。
    风动工具厂在改建以前，是一个只生产三种比较简单的风动工具，没有统一的操作规程，没有严格的质量标准，没有科学的管理制度的工厂。改建以后，主要的设备是苏联的，产品品种比以前的多几倍，技术也复杂得多。并且在产品的规格和要求，工艺过程，生产组织和管理，甚至连工具的保管和设备的维护等方面，也都是按照苏联风动工具厂的最新成就来规定的。这对于我们现有的管理干部、技术人员和工人来说，都是陌生的。因此，要实现苏联设计的要求，就必须全面学习苏联，学习苏联的先进技术经验、先进管理经验以及苏联同志的优秀工作方法和作风。
    全面学习苏联，必须从技术设计资料学习起。但是在相当长的时间内，我们并没有认识到这一点。我们有些人认为用原有的工人，原有的组织机构，原有的管理方法，也同样会达到苏联的设计要求；再加上把技术设计资料当作“秘密”资料封锁起来，所以就没有领导和组织全体职工学习设计资料。因此，我们虽天天喊“学习苏联”，但对“学什么”，“如何学”是不明确的。例如总支委员会去年五、六月份工作计划提到“加强思想领导，全面开展学习苏联，推广先进经验……”又提到“组织工人学习苏联机床说明书和技术操作规程”。但在计划中只要求工会“继续开展群众性的生产革新运动，学习苏联先进经验，贯彻苏联专家建议”。实际上，也没有组织工人学习机床说明书和技术操作规程。去年第三季度工作计划提到“在全厂有计划有准备地大力开展技术革新……掀起学习和推广苏联先进经验的高潮……，”这里所指的“高潮”和“全面”学习苏联是什么呢？这主要是几种先进车刀法和贯彻专家的某些具体建议而已。
    因为把学习苏联的工作只是停留在推广某几种苏联先进工作法和贯彻专家在日常工作中的具体建议上面，所以，一年来，虽然有一定的成绩，例如机械装配车间就有百分之九十以上的车工在一百多台车床上运用了先进的切削经验，使效率提高一倍到七倍；又如贯彻了四百多条专家的具体建议后，工人的技术水平和生产数量、质量都有所提高，但是，这还不能解决生产、管理方面的根本问题。最严重的是有些设备安装好后，不能立即开动。先进的劳动组织也没有贯彻，生产周期过长。能开动的某些设备，但因工人并不了解这些设备的性能，不懂得操作规程，事故多，效率低，甚至闹出很多笑话。许多问题在苏联供给的设计资料上早就讲清了，而我们在车间里还当成“关键”来抓。如重型凿岩机缸体部件，车间在宣传大标语上写着“集中力量突破缸体大关键”、一直喊了二十多天，废品还是废品，后来从抽屉里拿出苏联操作规程一看，发现原来是因为没按规程生产的缘故。
    因为这些原因，生产数量和质量都达不到要求。设计资料上规定的劳动定额，如KM—4式凿岩机按设计要求每一台分劳动定额为三百零七小时，我们作的现在为四百一十六小时，相差一百零九小时。轻便凿岩机按设计要求为三十九点九九小时，现在为四十九点三六小时。KM—5式铆钉机设计要求为十四点七二小时，现在为二九点二八小时，差一台分小时左右。其中有一九五二年即开始成批生产的一种苏联式凿岩机，按设计要求的工时定额是四十二点九八五小时，但到现在，我们仍得用四十六小时来生产。我们现在制造的八种各式产品没有一种产品质量达到设计要求。
    由于没有明确必须贯彻苏联技术设计资料的要求，技术革新运动就走了弯路。车间大张旗鼓地宣传“以技术革新为主要内容的劳动竞赛”，而领导方面则没有向职工指出技术革新方向。不少职工在办公室或车间里埋头研究发明创造，结果学习苏联的空气反而薄弱起来。有的技术人员整天在办公室里琢磨设计创造：“中国式铆钉机”、“沈阳式铆钉机”，积极设计我厂生产所不需要的多孔钻。有的工人也抱着“学习别人不如自己创造光荣”的思想，不懂得机床效能乱革新，会使新的机床遭到破坏，使生产陷于混乱和极大困难状态。
    像这样的例子是很多的。经过这一系列具体事实的教训，以及由于上级党委、行政领导上几次报告的启示，一九五四年十月，党总支委员会才清醒起来，明确必须全面学习苏联，贯彻苏联设计的要求。这也就形成了我们领导工作的一个转折点。
    党组织接受过去的严重教训，及时监督行政在十月份作出“贯彻苏联设计要求”方案，并已编排具体的计划开始进行生产技术准备的补课工作。这个计划从今年一月一日开始。总支委员会确定的学习方针是：紧紧依靠苏联专家指导，从头学起，干什么学什么，贯彻理论联系实际的方法，严格按照技术设计资料进行生产。
    全面学习苏联的工作是艰巨而复杂的，进行这一工作首先必须加强党的思想工作，克服各种落后思想的抵抗。这是社会主义思想跟资本主义思想斗争的过程。
    根据目前总支委员会对全厂干部和工人的思想调查和分析，必须克服保守思想和经验主义。有的人不愿意“弃旧换新”，想用手工业的方法来管理新企业。在科室和车间里有这样的话：“苏联是社会主义社会，我们是新民主主义社会，哪能达到人家的要求！”“苏联三十七年，我们才五年，哪能赶得上！”有的人又摆老“资格”说：“苏联三十年经验，我二十年经验。”一部分工人认为凭自己的经验，不按工艺规程一样可以完成任务。有些人以为自己工作已做得不错：“我们现在能出产好几种新式产品，比过去修修配配一种产品不是强得多吗？”如组织工人学习苏联机床说明书，全厂只有二、三十名工人报名参加。
    这些保守、自满思想，实在是全面学习苏联、贯彻苏联技术设计资料要求的主要障碍。总支委员会已着手加强对职工的政治思想领导，从党内到党外，先领导后群众，先干部后工人，层层动员、讨论和批判，坚决保证树立老老实实、勤勤恳恳的学习态度，以便使生产迅速地走上轨道，为国家社会主义工业化做出重大的贡献。
