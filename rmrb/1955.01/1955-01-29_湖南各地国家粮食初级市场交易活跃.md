Active Transactions in National Primary Grain Markets Across Hunan

    National primary grain markets in Hunan Province are very active. From the beginning of December last year to the present, over 4 million jin of staple grains and miscellaneous grains have been transacted in more than 1,600 national primary markets throughout the province. In Hengyang, Xiangtan, Shaoyang and other special districts, many national primary grain markets now have 3,000 to 4,000 jin of grain listed per session, and grain prices are also very stable.
    After the completion of the unified grain purchase work, various places in Hunan Province strengthened their leadership over the national primary grain markets. Ningxiang, Xiangyin, Shaoyang and other counties have organized primary market management committees. Now the national primary grain markets in various places are generally equipped with full-time transaction management personnel to ensure the correct development of market business.

    湖南各地国家粮食初级市场交易活跃
    湖南省各地国家粮食初级市场交易很活跃。从去年十二月初到目前止，全省一千六百多个国家初级市场已成交主粮和杂粮四百多万斤。衡阳、湘潭、邵阳等专区很多国家粮食初级市场现在每场上市的粮食都有三、四千斤，粮价也很平稳。
    湖南省各地在粮食统购工作结束后，都加强了对国家粮食初级市场的领导。宁乡、湘阴、邵阳等县都组织了初级市场管理委员会。现在各地的国家粮食初级市场一般都配备了专职的交易管理人员，保证市场业务的正确开展。（新华社）
