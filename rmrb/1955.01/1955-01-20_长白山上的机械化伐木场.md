    Mechanized Logging Site on Changbai Mountain

    On the ranges of Mount Laoye in the Changbai Mountain forest area of our motherland, a mechanized logging site is under construction.

    Here, electric saws will be used for felling trees, electric saws for timber production, machines for log gathering, tractors for timber transport, and machines for loading. These, connected to the forest railway, will form a complete mechanized operation. Currently, tractor depots, small power plants, machine repair shops, simple wood processing plants, offices, and dormitories have been largely constructed. At present, two electric saws and two log-gathering machines have begun experimental production.

    When you walk onto the logging site, you will hear the roar of machines. Look! The young chainsaw operators, two people holding an electric saw, press a button, and with a "whoosh!" in less than two minutes, a tree as thick as a person can hug falls down in the direction people have planned. The limbing workers remove the branches. Next is the next process—the log-gathering machine gathering logs. At this time, some other workers tie a thick iron rope the thickness of a finger to one end of the wood, and the flagman waves a blue flag. You can see the wood being dragged by the iron rope, like a fish being hooked, climbing along the already repaired road to the designated place. Soon, after the tractors allocated by the state arrive, the wood will be effortlessly dragged to the log yard by the "iron oxen" of the forest. In this way, the historically seasonal production of the forest industry will be fundamentally changed.

    This mechanized logging site will officially start production in February this year, and by the end of the year, it plans to fell, gather, and transport 40,000 cubic meters of timber.

    长白山上的机械化伐木场
    在祖国长白山林区老爷岭山脉上，一座机械化伐木场正在建设中。
    这里，将采用电锯伐木，电锯造材，机器集材，拖拉机运材，机器装车。这些，和森林铁路连接起来，就形成一个整个的机械化作业过程。现在，拖拉机库，小型发电厂，机器修理厂，木材简易加工厂，办公室和宿舍已经大部修建起来。目前，已有两台电锯，两台集材机开始试验性的生产。
    当你走到山场，就会听到机器的轰鸣声。看！那年轻的电锯手，两个人托着一台电锯，一按电钮，“唰——”的一声，用不了两分钟，一搂粗的一棵大树，就按着人们预定的方向倒下了。打桠工，打去枝桠。接着是下一道工序——集材机集材。这时，另一些工人就把手指粗的一条大铁绳，拴到木头的一端，旗手一摆蓝旗，只见那木头被铁绳拽着，像鱼儿被钓上钩似的，顺着已修好的道路，向指定的地方爬去。不久，国家拨给的拖拉机到来后，木头将被那森林里的“铁牛”，不费力地拖到楞场去。这样，森林工业有历史性的季节生产，将得到根本改变。
    这个机械化伐木场将在今年二月正式开工生产，到年底计划伐木、集材、运材四万立方公尺。
