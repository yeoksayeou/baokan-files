    Taiyuan Cement Factory workers and farmers in nearby villages held a joyous Spring Festival celebration. On the 24th, more than 400 farmers from Ximing Village, Nanzhai Village, and Beizhai Village in the suburbs of Taiyuan visited the Taiyuan Cement Factory to wish the workers a happy Spring Festival. Early in the morning of the 25th, the Taiyuan Cement Factory's visiting group went to Ximing Village, Nanzhai Village, and Beizhai Village to return the visit. Over the two days, they held several joint celebration evenings during their mutual visits. At the celebrations, worker and farmer representatives introduced their production achievements in 1954 and production plans for 1955. Worker representatives especially told the farmers that they had already increased cement production by 270 tons for the country this year. The farmers were particularly impressed that the workers had maintained normal attendance during the Spring Festival and had broken the new quota and overproduced more than 60 tons of cement on the first day of the Spring Festival (the 24th). The farmers in each village expressed to the workers that they would do a good job in preparing for spring plowing, produce more grain, support industrial construction, and support the struggle to liberate Taiwan.
