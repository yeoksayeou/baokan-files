State-Run Friendship Farm is preparing 3,400+ hectares to sow wheat, soybeans, and other crops this year, in order to prepare sufficient seeds for all cultivated land (over 20,000 hectares) next year. Seeds needed for this year's sowing have now been collected from various locations. Agricultural technicians, under the guidance and assistance of Soviet experts, are conducting seed identification and wheat warm water soaking and germination experiments. The motor vehicle team's drivers are driving new cars donated by the Soviet Union, transporting Soviet-supplied motor five-铧 plows and other agricultural implements to the farm site one after another, preparing to reclaim wasteland.

These seeds were supplied by some farms under the Northeast State Farms Administration and the Heilongjiang Province State Farms Administration. The Gongzhuling, Erlongshan, and other three farms under the Northeast State Farms Administration supplied more than 40 tons of wheat seeds. More than 95% of these are excellent varieties that are cold-resistant and rust-resistant, such as Haxi 2370, Haxi 2602, and Gansu 96. Baoquanling Farm supplied 40 tons of Manchurian Golden Soybean seeds. Farms under the Heilongjiang Province State Farms Administration also supplied more than 90 tons of excellent wheat varieties. The corn, sorghum, millet, barley, and other miscellaneous grain seeds needed by the State-Run Friendship Farm are being collected and supplied by the local county and district people's governments.

    国营友谊农场准备春耕
    国营友谊农场为了给明年全部耕地（二万多公顷）准备充足的种籽，今年将播种小麦、大豆等作物三千四百多公顷。现在已从各地调集了今年播种所需要的种子。农业技师在苏联专家指导和帮助下，正进行种子鉴定和小麦温汤浸种、发芽试验。机务组的汽车驾驶员正驾驶着苏联赠送的新汽车，把刚从苏联运来的机力五铧犁等农具陆续运往农场场地，准备开垦荒地。
    这些种籽是东北国营农场管理局和黑龙江省国营农场管理局所属的一些农场供给的。东北国营农场管理局所属的公主岭、二龙山等三个农场，供给小麦种籽四十多吨。其中百分之九十五以上都是耐寒、抗锈的哈系二三七○、哈系二六○二和甘肃九十六等优良品种，宝泉岭农场供给满仓金大豆良种四十吨。黑龙江省国营农场管理局所属的农场也供给九十多吨小麦良种。国营友谊农场所需要的玉米、高粱、谷子、大麦等杂粮种籽，是由当地县、区人民政府负责调集供应的。
