    Cherish the Land
    By our reporter, Ji Xichen
    One early winter morning, the sun shone golden light upon the earth. Flocks of pigeons and wild birds soared through the air, sometimes landing in the dense late-autumn crops, sometimes calling out in alarm as they flew towards the clouds. In past years at this time, these harvested fields were barren everywhere. But now, newly planted winter turnips, potatoes, broad beans, and vegetables cover the black, oily soil like a green velvet carpet.
    "Whatever we plant on this land grows! It's truly a treasure bowl!"
    The members of the Xinmin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hedeng Township, Xinfan County, who were conducting their third harvest in the fields, boasted to us about this fertile land. Deputy Director Shi Liangcheng held up a bunch of potatoes he had just dug up, looked at them against the sun, and said with a squinting smile:
    "Look, these were only planted after the autumn harvest, and in less than fifty or sixty days, the tubers are already as big as fists!"
    This miracle in the fields astonished the farmers for dozens of miles around. People flocked here in groups to visit and learn from the Xinmin Agricultural Production Cooperative's experience in cherishing the land and tapping into the potential of agricultural production.
    "Amazing, amazing! I'm over sixty years old, and this is the first time I've encountered such a strange thing!"
    "This bunch must weigh over a pound!"
    "How many pounds can you harvest per mu? ...I'd say at least four or five hundred pounds!"
    "Four or five hundred? I bet they won't let you have less than eight hundred pounds!"
    People chattered animatedly. Shi Liangcheng, who had been standing to one side with his head lowered, could no longer contain the joy in his heart. He suddenly interrupted the discussion and said loudly:
    "You're guessing wrong. Not eight hundred, but over a thousand pounds!"
    Shi Liangcheng also told everyone that among the more than 2,400 mu of various short-term crops that they had additionally planted and intercropped, the income from the additional planting alone was more than 96 million yuan. After deducting various expenses, each of the four hundred members could increase their net income by an average of 170,000 yuan.
    The harvest is indeed abundant. But it was obtained from the land only after struggle, creation, and hard work.
    Since ancient times, the farmers here have cultivated the land according to ancestral customs, planting only two seasons of crops: spring crops and rice. During the "slack season" after the autumn harvest, everyone visited relatives, friends, went to market, and sat in tea houses, while large tracts of land lay fallow.
    "Can we use this time to try and plant another season of crops?" Last autumn, when discussing how to implement the instructions of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to strive to increase grain production and support the disaster areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the members of the Xinmin Agricultural Production Cooperative enthusiastically studied this question.
    "Change two seasons to three? That's nonsense. Our plains are not like the mountains, where there are more people than land. The potential has already been exhausted. A mu of rice used to yield only three or four hundred jin, but now it's increased to over six hundred jin. Where else can we increase production?" An old man named Long Lahu objected.
    "We can't just look at the past," Communist Party member Zeng Yuqing (female) firmly supported the proposal to plant an additional season. She continued, "In the past, the land belonged to the landlords, but now it's our own. We must make good use of the land's potential."
    "It's not that easy!"
    "With such good climate and land, crops will grow well."
    "What if we lose money?"
    "One seed in the ground, ten seeds in the granary, we won't lose money!"
    In a long discussion, the Party members and cooperative cadres carefully calculated the accounts for everyone, specifically pointing out the unutilized potential: for example, planting 1,000 mu of winter turnips (a green manure and feed crop) would not only allow the turnip roots to be used as fertilizer to improve the soil, but would also yield dry turnip seeds worth two or three million yuan. In addition, many radishes, broad bean seedlings, and water cabbage could be intercropped... which people could eat and also feed to pigs, which would save a lot of grain to support the disaster areas. This reform also resolved the long-standing conflict between turnip and rapeseed cultivation in the area: in the past, you couldn't plant rapeseed if you planted turnips, and you couldn't plant turnips if you planted rapeseed; now, after planting an additional season of turnips in advance, a large amount of land could be allocated to plant rapeseed.
    "So, we can greatly increase production!" In the end, even those who originally disagreed felt it made sense.
    The plan to plant an additional season was approved. But many people still worried in their hearts: Will there really be a harvest?
    "Sisters, let's go, let's take the lead!"
    The next morning after the plan was approved, Zeng Yuqing called out to a group of women from her production team, and, carrying hoes, manure baskets, and seeds, they first went to the newly harvested fields. At this time, Yang Xianming, a female technician who had recently graduated from agricultural school, ran over to help them "sprout" the potatoes using scientific methods.
    "Zeng Yuqing, you're doing the right thing. You should set an example for everyone to see." The technician, digging in the soil, encouraged her, "Originally, this kind of land can grow good crops, the problem is just that we are willing to work hard, and we also have to know the methods!"
    "Look, is this planting method correct? First sprinkle grass ash manure, and then cover it with a layer of sandy soil..."
    "That's right, this can keep it warm and prevent rot."
    In the days after sowing, they ran to the fields several times a day. One moment, they used tree branches to put up fences to block chickens and ducks in the soft soil, and the next, they carried a bundle of straw to build warm sheds on the ground to prevent rain and frost. Sometimes they knelt down and used their fingers to dig into the soil, looking at the newly sprouted, tiny seedlings. After a few days, when they saw the green seedlings grow three or four inches high, how happy everyone was!
    "Great, it's a success! Let others come and see!"
    The good news quickly spread throughout the village. Long Lahu, the old man who had originally strongly opposed planting late-autumn crops, also happily came to the edge of the field with others. He bent down, touched the green seedlings for a long time, then stood up, thoughtfully nodding his head and said:
    "In the past, people said that immortals were capable, but now people are ten times more capable than immortals. Things that immortals can't do, people can do."
    "Let's all get to work, and we'll definitely have a harvest," Everyone said in unison.
    All the production teams in the whole cooperative were immediately swept into the hot tide of sowing, launching an offensive of increasing production on the unutilized land. Plowing, delivering manure, sowing seeds, transplanting seedlings... whether it was a foggy morning or a hazy moonlit dusk, the flat, fertile fields were filled with busy crowds everywhere.
    When people realized that every vacant lot could be used to grow crops, everyone searched for wasteland everywhere. Under the corners of houses, on the ridges of fields, beside roads, and even within old cemeteries, every small piece of wasteland that could be utilized was now being reclaimed and sown.
    "By accumulating these small pieces, we have eliminated eighty-seven mu of vacant land before and after." Shi Liangcheng stood on the ridge of the field with his legs spread apart, recounting this process to the visitors, and suddenly turned his head, adding meaningfully: "Besides these, we also have a major reform!"
    "What's that?"
    "Our whole cooperative has also rationally planned the land."
    At this time, everyone noticed the red flags fluttering in the distant fields—the members of the land planning team sent by the Wenjiang Special District were finally checking the graphics of the measured and planned land.
    The small plots of land that were originally divided like pieces of tofu have now become wide plots of a dozen or twenty mu; the small field ridges and small ditches that crisscrossed in the past have now been cleared and filled. This alone increased the cultivated land by sixty-six mu. Nine new-style animal-drawn farm implements are traveling back and forth across the transformed fields, and the cooperative members are planting rapeseed and wheat. Due to this excavation of the land's potential, the rapeseed planting area has expanded by 23 percent compared to 1953.
    Speaking of all these changes, thinking of the happy prospects for the future, how could Shi Liangcheng and his cooperative members bear to suppress the joy in their hearts!
    "Comrades, you just watch, we will have an even greater harvest next year!" Yes, there will definitely be a harvest. On the new road to collective prosperity, people are not only changing themselves, but also learning to more cleverly transform nature and the land, allowing the earth to grow even more abundant products for us! Editor's note: The peasants of Hedeng Township, Xinfan County, Sichuan Province, tapped the potential of the land and increased planting a season of crops during the gap between the autumn harvest and the planting of small spring crops, generally achieving a bumper harvest, which is a great achievement. This fact shattered the myth that the Sichuan West Plain has a large population and little land, and that the potential has been exhausted, opening up a broad avenue for increased production in the Sichuan West Plain.

    珍惜大地
    本报记者　纪希晨
    初冬的一个清晨，太阳金光闪闪地照射着大地。飞翔在空中的一群群的鸽子、野鸟，时而落进茂密的晚秋作物丛中，时而惊恐地叫着飞向云际。往年这种时候，在这片收割了的田野里，到处都是光秃秃的。可是现在，新增种的冬苕籽、马铃薯、密胡豆和菜蔬，像绿色的绒毡一般铺盖着黑油油的土地。
    “我们这地，种啥长啥，真是聚宝盆！”
    正在田间进行第三次收获的新繁县禾登乡新民农业生产合作社的社员，向我们这样夸耀着这片肥美的土地。副社长史良成举起刚刚挖起的一窝马铃薯，对着太阳照了照，眯缝着笑眼说：
    “你们看，这是秋收后才种下的，不到五六十天，蛋蛋长的就有拳头大哩！”
    这片田地上出现的这个奇迹，惊动了周围几十里的农民。大家成群结队地涌到这里参观、访问，学习新民农业生产合作社怎样珍惜土地、挖掘农业生产潜力的经验。
    “稀奇，稀奇，我活了六十几，还是头一回遇见这怪事哩！”
      “这一窝怕有斤把重呢！”
    “一亩能收多少斤？……我看少不了四、五百斤！”
      “四五百？八百斤怕人家也不让给你！”
    人们七嘴八舌地议论着；原先低着头站在一边的史良成，再也压抑不住他心头的欢喜，突然打断大家的谈论，高声说：
    “猜的不对。不是八百，是一千多斤！”
    史良成又告诉大家：在他们增种和寄种的两千四百多亩各种短期作物中，单增种一项的收入就有九千六百多万元。除去各种开支，四百个社员平均每个人可以增加十七万元的纯收益。
    收获确实是丰富的。但它是经过斗争、创造和辛勤劳动之后，才从大地上取得的。
    从古老的年代起，这里的农民都按照祖传的习惯耕种着土地，一年只种小春作物和稻子两季庄稼。在秋收以后的一段“农闲”季节里，大家走亲、访友、赶集、坐茶馆，而大片大片的土地却被空废着。
    “能不能利用这段时间，争取再种一季庄稼呢？”去年秋天，在讨论如何执行中共四川省委努力增产粮食、支援长江中下游灾区的指示时，新民农业生产合作社的社员们，热烈地研究着这个问题。
    “把两季改三季？尽是瞎说。我们平地不比山区，人多地少，潜力早就挖尽了。一亩稻子过去只收三、四百斤，如今增到六百多斤，哪还有产可增呢？”一个叫龙拉虎的老汉反对说。
    “不能光看过去，”共产党员曾玉清（女）坚决拥护增种一季的主张，她接着说：“过去土地是地主的，如今是我们自己的了，我们要好好利用土地的潜力。”
    “没有那么容易！”
    “有这样好的气候和土地，庄稼会长好的。”
    “赔了本怎么办呢？”
    “一籽下地，十籽入仓，不会赔本的！”
    在长时间的讨论里，党员和社的干部们向大家仔细地算了账，具体地指出那些未加利用的潜力：例如增种一千亩冬苕（是一种绿肥和饲料作物），苕根既可以抵肥料改良土壤，还可收到价值两三千万元的干苕籽。此外，还可寄种许多萝卜、胡豆秧、水白菜……，人可以吃，也可以喂猪，这样就能节省出不少的粮食去支援灾区。经过这样改革，还解决了当地多年来苕子和油菜的耕作矛盾：往年种了苕籽不能种油菜，种了油菜就不能种苕籽；现在提前增种一季苕籽后，便可以调拨出大批土地来种植油菜了。
    “这么说，咱还有可能大大增产哩！”最后，那些原来不同意的人也觉得有道理了。
    增种一季的计划通过了。但是许多人的内心还在担忧：真会有收获吗？
    “姊妹们，走，我们打头阵去！”
    计划通过的第二天清晨，曾玉清招呼着她们生产队的一群妇女，扛着镢头、粪筐和种籽，首先走到刚收割了的田野里。这时，不久前才从农业学校出来的女技术员杨仙明跑了来，帮助她们用科学方法给马铃薯“催芽”。
    “曾玉清，你作的很对。应该首先做出榜样给大家看看。”技术员一面挖着泥土，一面鼓励她说：“本来，像这样的土地都是能长好庄稼的，问题只要我们肯努力，并且还要懂得办法！”
    “你看，这样种法对不对？先撒上草灰粪，然后再壅上一层沙土……”
    “对的，这样既可以保暖，也可以防腐烂。”
    在播种后的那些日子里，她们一天几次跑到地里去。一会用树枝在松软的泥土里插起挡鸡鸭的篱笆，一会背来一捆稻草，在地面上搭起防备阴雨和寒霜的暖棚。有时她们跪下去，用手指掘开泥土，探望着那刚刚生出的幼小嫩芽。过了几天，当她们看见绿苗长起有三、四寸高的时候，大伙是多么高兴啊！
    “好啦，成功啦！让别人都来参观吧！”
    喜讯飞快地传遍全村，原来坚决反对种晚秋作物的龙拉虎老汉，也欢欢喜喜地同别人一起来到地边。他对着绿油油的幼苗，弯下腰，伸手摸了好半天，然后站起来，若有所思地点点头说：
    “过去人说神仙能，如今人比神仙能十分，神仙办不到的事，人都能办得到噢。”
    “都来动手干吧，一准会有收获的。” 众人也异口同声地说。
    全社所有的生产队，立刻全都卷入播种的热潮里，向未被利用的大地，展开增产的进军。翻地的、送粪的、撒种的、移苗的……无论是浓雾弥漫的清晨，或是月色朦胧的黄昏，平坦、肥沃的田野里，到处都沸腾着忙碌的人群。
    当人们懂得每一块空地都可以用来生长农作物时，大家到处寻找荒地，屋角下、田坎上、道路旁，以及古老的坟地内，凡是可以利用的每一小块荒地，现在都被开垦出来播种了。
    “这样积零为整，我们前后消灭了八十七亩空地。”史良成两腿叉开站在田坎上，向参观的人们叙述了这段过程后，忽然又转侧着头，意味深长地添了一句：“除了这些，我们还有一项重大的改革咧！”
      “啥事呢？”
    “我们全社还合理地规划了土地。”
    这时，大家才注意到飘扬在远方田野里的红旗，——温江专区派来的土地规划队的队员们，正在最后地校正着测划过了的土地的图形。
    原来被割裂的豆腐块似的小块田地，现在都变成了宽阔的十几亩、二十亩的大块了；昔日左右纵横的小田坎、小水沟，现在都铲除了，填平了。仅仅这一项，他们便增加了六十六亩耕地。九部牛拉的新式农具，正在变了形的田地上来往穿行，社员们在种油菜和小麦。由于这样挖掘了土地的潜力，油菜的播种面积比一九五三年扩大了百分之二十三。
    谈到这一切变化，想到未来幸福的前景，史良成和他的社员们，怎会忍得住内心的欢喜呢！
      “同志们，你们看着吧，明年我们会有更大丰收的！”　　是的，一定会丰收的。在集体富裕的新道路上，人们不仅改变着自己，也学会更加聪明地改造自然和土地，让大地为我们生长出更丰盛的产品！编者按：四川省新繁县禾登乡的农民，挖掘土地潜力，在秋收后和小春作物播种前的一段空隙时间里，增种一季作物，普遍获得丰收，成绩是巨大的。这一事实，打破了人们过去认为川西平原人多地少，潜力已经挖尽的神话，为川西平原开辟了一条广阔的增产途径。
