    The Product Quality of Shenyang Second Machine Tool Factory is Too Bad
    Jia Ming
    The Second Bureau of Machinery of the First Ministry of Machine Building inspected the production work of Shenyang Second Machine Tool Factory last year and found that the quality of their products was very poor.
    In July last year, the Bureau randomly inspected the factory's inventory of old products, the "255 Radial Drilling Machine" and the "2121 Vertical Drilling Machine," and found that the safety devices on the machine tools could not function as intended. Some "255 Radial Drilling Machines" would automatically stop after less than twenty seconds during heavy cutting. Some machine tools had inflexible electric switches after starting, the lubricating oil pump could not supply oil, the gears were very noisy, and the main spindle box leaked oil. Upon disassembly and inspection, it was discovered that many parts did not meet standards at all, and there were iron filings and sediment in the main spindle box and gear box. Some machine tools had iron filings in the ball bearings, the bearings were worn, and the operation was not smooth. In total, the inventory of "2121 Vertical Drilling Machines" amounted to 303 units, and the "255 Radial Drilling Machines" amounted to 90 units, all of which were substandard.
    Due to not strictly adhering to the trial production regulations, the quality of new products was also very poor. In June last year, they trial-produced two "262Д Boring Machines." The Bureau inspected one of them (the other had already been sold) and found that 11 out of 17 precision standards were unqualified. Many products were blindly put into mass production before the trial production was successful. Among them were 40 "2Б53 Radial Drilling Machines," 120 "2А125 Vertical Drilling Machines," and 80 "2А135 Vertical Drilling Machines." As a result, many parts were unqualified, and a large number of materials were scrapped!
    A high defect rate is also one of the characteristics of this factory. The scrap rate of castings in the first half of last year was 29%, and it rose to 38.5% in the third quarter, making it the factory with the highest scrap rate in the entire Bureau. According to the factory's planning department, the man-hours lost due to defects in the first half of the year amounted to 112,000 hours, the materials wasted due to defects in castings amounted to more than 470 tons, and the materials wasted due to defects in processing amounted to more than 30 tons.
    Failure to pay attention to product quality has brought serious losses to the country. According to a preliminary estimate by the factory's planning department, repairing old products and remanufacturing new products will result in a loss of more than 189,000 man-hours; due to repairs and scrapped parts, the loss is 12 billion yuan. This situation has also disrupted the factory's overall production plan. From September 1954 to the first quarter of 1955, this factory was unable to produce new finished products. Currently, in addition to the stipulated 6 billion yuan of working capital, they have borrowed another 3 billion yuan from the bank, and they have to pay about 140 million yuan in interest every month.
    The poor product quality of this factory has harmed many units. For example, the "2121 Vertical Drilling Machine" was put into production in 1952, and more than 1,000 units have been shipped out. The "255 Radial Drilling Machine" was put into production in 1953, and more than 130 units have been shipped out. It is impossible to estimate how much difficulty and loss these poor-quality machine tools have caused to the production work of the using units. The factory's future products will mainly be supplied to important projects and national defense construction units. In the aforementioned four new products, 56% of the 1955 output is supplied to many key projects designed by the Soviet Union and domestically, but because the quality is poor, some units have had to order from abroad, which has affected the equipment installation work of some projects.
    The quality problem of Shenyang Second Machine Tool Factory is so serious. In addition to the weak technical strength and the fact that the main leading cadres have only recently transferred to new jobs and are not yet familiar with production operations, the subjective reasons should be said to be the main ones, and there are many responsibilities that cannot be shirked.
    First, the factory's leading cadres do not pay attention to quality issues, and no one is responsible for quality. Before the Bureau inspected the factory's products, many users had raised many opinions on the factory's product quality, but the factory's leading cadres were not vigilant at all and did not actively try to improve. One leading cadre even personally went to the scrap warehouse to pick out scrapped parts for use in order to complete the quantity targets. Under the influence of the leadership's thinking, the inspection department has long adopted a perfunctory attitude during inspections. The workers are also careless and irresponsible about quality. For example, the second work section of the second workshop once failed to calibrate the center when processing gears, and after making the first piece, they did not carefully check it, and ten consecutive pieces were unqualified. Another example is the "2121 Vertical Drilling Machine" feed box casting. From the wooden mold and casting to machining, no one carefully inspected it until the assembly, when the problem was discovered, and all 170-plus pieces were scrapped. Chief Engineer Yang Jingjia has always been irresponsible in his work and often does not express his opinions on technical issues, so that many problems have not been resolved for a long time.
    Second, technical management is very chaotic. There is no management system for drawings. Without the approval of the factory director or chief engineer, the design section can arbitrarily use blank slips to notify various sections and workshops to change drawings. Most of the process regulations and inspection regulations have not been formulated, and even if they have been formulated, they have not been seriously implemented. Relying solely on the experience of workers, it is of course impossible to produce products that meet standards. Equipment installation is also substandard. Equipment, jigs, and measuring tools are not inspected and repaired on time during use. The Bureau inspected 157 foreign-made machine tools, and only 15 were installed qualified. Last year, six out of the eight sets of main jigs used for the trial production of four new products were substandard. Most of the other measuring tools are no longer precise, and 540 out of 1,052 thousandth shims have been damaged. Using these substandard equipment and tools for production and using inaccurate measuring tools to inspect products will inevitably result in a large number of defective products.
    Third, political work is weak. For a long time, the Party organization has paid more attention to the quantity of products in ensuring and supervising production, while neglecting quality; it has not educated and criticized the erroneous ideas of leading cadres and workers who neglect product quality.
    Now the Second Bureau of Machinery has invited four Soviet experts to Shenyang Second Machine Tool Factory to help solve the quality problem. The factory is now organizing forces according to the experts' suggestions, drafting measures and plans to improve product quality, and has decided to repair the inventory of old products and conduct remedial trial production of four new products in order to completely solve the quality problem.

    沈阳第二机床厂的产品质量太坏了
    贾明
    第一机械工业部第二机器管理局去年检查了沈阳第二机床厂的生产工作，发现他们的产品质量十分低劣。
    去年七月，管理局抽查了这个厂库存的老产品“二五五摇臂钻”和“二一二一立钻”，发现机床上的保险器不能起保险作用；有些“二五五摇臂钻”在进行重切削时，不到二十秒钟就自动停车了；有些机床在开车后，电开关不灵活，润滑油泵不能给油，齿轮噪音很大，主轴箱漏油。拆开检查时，发现有许多部件根本不合标准，主轴箱和齿轮箱里有铁屑、泥沙。有些机床的滚珠轴承中有铁沫，轴承被磨损，运转不灵。总计库存的“二一二一立钻”三百零三台、“二五五摇臂钻”九十台，全部不合标准。
    由于不严格遵守试制规程，新产品的质量也很坏。去年六月，他们试制了两台“二六二Д搪床”，管理局检查了其中的一台（另一台已卖出去），发现在十七项精密度标准中有十一项不合格。有很多产品还没有试制成功，就盲目地大量下料。其中有“二Б五三摇臂钻”四十台、“二А一二五立钻”一百二十台、“二А一三五立钻”八十台。结果许多部件不合格，下的料大批作废了！
    废品多也是这个工厂的特点之一。铸件的废品率去年上半年是百分之二十九，到第三季度竟上升至百分之三十八点五，是全管理局废品率最高的一个厂。根据该厂计划科的统计，上半年因出废品所损失的工时达十一万二千小时，因铸件出废品所浪费的材料达四百七十多吨，加工出废品浪费材料三十多吨。
    不重视产品质量，给国家带来了严重的损失。据该厂计划科初步估算，返修老产品、重制新产品，合计将损失十八万九千多个工时；由于返修和零件报废，损失一百二十亿元。这种情况还打乱了全厂的生产计划。从一九五四年九月到一九五五年第一季度，这个工厂无法生产出新的成品。目前除规定的六百亿元流动资金外，他们又向银行借了三百亿元的债，每月都要付约一亿四千万元的利息。
    这个工厂的产品质量不好，受害的单位是很多的。如“二一二一立钻”是一九五二年开始生产的，已出厂一千多台，“二五五摇臂钻”是一九五三年开始生产的，已出厂一百三十余台。这些质量不好的机床，给使用单位的生产工作造成多少困难和损失，是无法估计的。该厂今后的产品主要供应重要工程和国防建设单位。在前述四种新产品一九五五年的产量中，有百分之五十六是供给由苏联设计的和由国内设计的许多重点工程之用，但因为质量不好，有些单位不得不到国外订购，影响了某些工程的设备安装工作。
    沈阳第二机床厂的质量问题如此严重，追其原因，除了技术力量弱、主要领导干部新转业不久还不熟悉生产业务外，应该说主观原因是主要的，有许多责任是推卸不掉的。
    第一、厂的领导干部不重视质量问题，在质量方面无人负责。在管理局抽查该厂产品之前，许多用户已对该厂产品质量提出不少意见，但该厂领导干部毫不警惕，不积极想办法改进。有一个领导干部为了完成数量上的任务，竟亲自到废品库把报废的零件挑出来用。在领导思想影响下，检验部门在检验的时候长期采取马马虎虎的态度。工人群众对质量也是粗心大意，不负责任。如二车间二工段有一次加工齿轮时没有校准中心，做出第一个活后又没有认真检查，一连加工十个都不合格。又如“二一二一立钻”走刀箱铸件，从木型、铸造到机械加工，都没有认真检查，直到装配时才发现毛病，结果做出的一百七十多件全部报废。主任工程师杨景迦工作一贯不负责任，对技术问题经常不表示意见，使得很多问题长期不得解决。
    第二、技术管理非常混乱。图纸没有管理制度，不经厂长或主任工程师批准，设计科可以随便用白条子通知各科和车间改图。工艺规程和检验规程大都没有制订，制订了的也没有认真执行。只凭工人的经验办事，当然不可能生产出合乎标准的产品。设备安装也不合标准，设备、工卡具、量检具等在使用过程中不按时检修。管理局检查了一百五十七台国外制造的机床，安装合格的只有十五台。去年试制四种新产品所用的八套主要工卡具，有六套不合标准。其他量检具大部已不精密，一千零五十二块千分垫中有五百四十块已经损坏。使用这些不合标准的设备和工具进行生产和用不合精度的量检具检验产品，就不能不大量地出产废品。
    第三、政治工作薄弱。很长时期内，党组织在保证与监督生产中多注意产品数量，而忽视质量；对领导干部和工人群众中忽视产品质量的错误思想没有进行教育和批评。
    现在第二机器管理局已请了四位苏联专家到沈阳第二机床厂帮助解决质量问题。该厂正根据专家建议着手组织力量，拟订改进产品质量的措施计划，决定对库存老产品进行返修，对四种新产品进行试制补课，以彻底地解决质量问题。（附图片）
