Random Notes on Kawa Mountain

Government, Army and People
After the Nanjian-Lincang section of the South Yunnan Highway was opened to traffic, it only took three or four days to travel by bus from Kunming to Lincang - the southwestern border town of the motherland, and then from Lincang through Shuangjiang and Gengma, it took ten days to walk to Cangyuan. This area is the Kang Dian Gorge area, sandwiched between the Lancang River and the Nujiang River, located on the Nujiang Mountains. The Sanjianshan, Sipai Mountains, Daxue Mountains and Gongming Mountains are distributed throughout the territory, and the Nan Ding River, Xiaohei River and Nanka River run north and south into the Lancang River and Nujiang River, bordering Myanmar to the south. This is the southwesternmost edge of the motherland, known as the Kawa Mountain of thousands of miles of national defense.

Cangyuan County was liberated in 1951.

Cangyuan County is rich in products, producing dry valley, corn, rice, shellac, soybean trees, yellow fruit, bananas, pineapples and especially rich gold and silver deposits. The inhabitants of Cangyuan County are the simple and hardworking Kawa, Dai and Lahu people, with the Kawa people being the most numerous. In the past, under the oppression of the Kuomintang reactionaries, hard work and rich natural conditions did not bring happiness to the people of all ethnic groups.

Since liberation, the Cangyuan County People's Government and the local People's Liberation Army have continuously helped the people of all ethnic groups. From April 1952 to now, the Cangyuan County People's Government has lent more than 20,000 kilograms of seeds to the people of all ethnic groups and built more than 40 small and medium-sized canals. The troops stationed here helped farmers catch insects the year before last, catching a total of 66,204 kilograms of insects and 28 kilograms of pupae. The farmers generally commented: "In the past, the Kuomintang wanted grain and money, regardless of the life and death of the people; today, the People's Liberation Army doesn't even smoke our cigarettes, catching insects for us in the rain, and doesn't rest even when their hands are broken. They are really good troops of Chairman Mao who work for our ethnic minorities!" The 3rd Company of a certain unit, in the midst of busy guard and construction tasks day and night, took time out to rebuild twenty-eight thatched houses burned down by Li Mi's remnant bandits for the Kawa people in the駐地, and opened up sixteen mu of land. The troops also cured 2,716 patients of the Kawa people and vaccinated 837 people. People said: "The Communist Party and Chairman Mao are better than my father and mother." In this way, the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army and the cadres of the People's Government gradually established close relationships with the local people of all ethnic groups.

The rainy season is approaching. The rainy season in the Kawa Mountain area is particularly long. The local people have to store firewood before the rainy season for burning during the rainy season. At this time, the elderly and headmen in the village, estimating that the People's Liberation Army did not understand the local seasons when they first arrived, mobilized the masses to send firewood to the People's Liberation Army. The first time, there were three animals and more than a hundred people, carrying it on their backs and驮的驮, happily shouting, sending more than 10,000 kilograms of firewood. Then, on the second and third days, more than a dozen surrounding villages successively sent firewood. At first, they refused to accept remuneration. Only after repeated persuasion and explanation by the comrades of the unit did they reluctantly accept some salt.

When the masses returned from hunting, they would definitely shout "老大" (calling the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government cadres as family members), take a beast leg or a pheasant, and drink a unity wine together. When the delegation of the National People's Comfort Mission to the People's Liberation Army arrived at the border last year, they sent elephant meat to entertain the comfort mission, and also sent Kawa掛包 (representing the heart) and Kawa刀 (representing the eyes), expressing their sincere respect for the comfort mission. Now, in every village, if there are strangers coming and going, they will immediately report to the People's Government and the People's Liberation Army. The Kawa老大 of Bakazhai automatically handed over sixteen 60mm mortar shells abandoned by the remnant bandits to the People's Liberation Army. There are many similar cases.

The song "The East is Red" can often be heard inside and outside the village. In the evening, the comrades of the People's Liberation Army become teachers, teaching literacy and arithmetic. On moonlit days, everyone entertains together. Everywhere in the village, you can hear such words: "Follow the Communist Party and listen to Chairman Mao."

"The army helps us, and we must also help the army..."

A Market Transformation
Last year, we revisited Mengdong, a major market in the Kawa Mountain area of Cangyuan County, a southwestern border town, and a distribution center for goods from home and abroad.

In previous years, Mengdong Street was known as a "free port," a market dominated by foreign goods. There was no customs, no national tax card; goods from all countries could be freely imported, and gold, silver and local specialties could be freely exported. Therefore, Mengdong became a paradise for those smugglers, tax evaders, speculators and adventurers. The streets were filled with colorful foreign goods stalls. These beautifully shaped and low-quality smuggled goods did not know how much labor and sweat they defrauded from the fraternal ethnic groups. Once the rainy season arrived, merchants immediately took the opportunity to hoard goods and raise prices to seek exorbitant profits. Normally, salt would only sell for sixty "half-opening" (silver yuan worth five corners) per hundred kilograms, but it would rise to about one hundred and twenty yuan during the rainy season. The average poor people who bought it piecemeal would have to pay three times more than usual. Therefore, most families try not to buy things during the rainy season. The street days during the rainy season were very deserted.

When we stayed in Mengdong, it was during the rainy season. It rained drizzling all day, and the mud on the roads in the坝子 sank to the knees. Due to flash floods, many roads and bridges were washed away, and traffic between here and the mainland and the surrounding villages was almost cut off. On the first street day of August, we braved the heavy rain to go to the street, thinking all the way: in previous years, very few people went to the street during the rainy season. Today, it is raining so hard, I am afraid no one will come. Who knew that it was completely beyond our expectations. It has changed! Not only were there many people on the street this day, but the market was very active.

In front of the Cangyuan branch of the State-owned Trading Company, people of all ethnic groups wearing various costumes crowded. They listened to the melodious Miao songs broadcast from the loudspeaker, while looking at the goods on the shelves; many people held in their hands and hugged in their arms the cloth, tops, axes, machetes they had just bought... They all had smiles on their faces.

This change began in the rainy season of the year before last, but the change last year was even greater. The year before last, the trade team (the branch company had not yet been established) transferred a large number of goods from Baoshan and Lincang before the rainy season, ensuring supply during the rainy season, stabilizing prices, and thwarting private merchants' attempts to seek exorbitant profits during the rainy season. Last year, the trade company, salt company, and grain bureau sales office were successively established and opened for business, with sufficient reserves of daily necessities and 610 kinds of daily commodities. The South Yunnan Highway was opened to traffic to Lincang, reducing transportation costs. During the rainy season, not only did the prices of various goods not rise, but the list prices of many varieties were reduced twice. These inexpensive and high-quality commodities produced by the motherland's factories were warmly welcomed by the people of all ethnic groups. An old Dai man pointed to the printed cloth of the trade company and said: "I have lived for more than sixty years, and I have never seen so much and such good printed cloth." Now there are fewer and fewer colorful foreign goods stalls beside the street. In June of the year before last, the People's Government stipulated that only commodities that were beneficial to the lives of the local people could be imported; the goods imported by Chinese merchants were all purchased and sold by the government.

At the entrance of the newly built grain bureau sales office, we saw hundreds of men and women of various ethnic groups such as Kawa and Lahu carrying bamboo baskets and sacks. Some were paying, and some were concentrating on grabbing the rice bought by others to look at, praising it incessantly. We asked an old Kawa villager who could speak a little Chinese: "Is the rice good? How much does it sell for per catty?" He replied with a smile: "Good! Good! One catty of rice, one吊 (one thousand) six hundred yuan, Chairman Mao leads well! The price of rice has not risen!" At the other end of the street, there was another relatively lively place, which was next to the salt stalls set up by the salt company. In previous years, the lack of salt was one of the disasters in the Kawa Mountain area. Poor families regarded a piece of salt weighing four taels as a treasure, tied it with a rope and hung it up. When making soup, they put it in the pot and dipped it before taking it out immediately. This four taels of salt would almost last for one or two months. Now, the Mengdong salt sales office sells not only the salt that is usually sold and wholesaled, but also 80 担 (one 担 is three catties) to 200 担 a day just on the street days. From this figure, we can see that the disaster of salt shortage no longer exists.

The rain gradually stopped. After sightseeing around the street for a week, we slowly realized that there was an important change, that is, the叮叮当当 sound of "half-opening"敲打 was rarely heard. In the spring of the year before last, this market was completely a "half-opening"阵地, and the Renminbi only circulated among state-owned enterprises such as government agencies, troops and trade teams. Now it has changed! In several streets in the Kawa Mountain area, such as Huangjiao, Yanshuai, Nanla... and other places, the Renminbi has gained the absolute trust of the people of all ethnic groups, and the average circulation volume of about 80% is the Renminbi. When the Kawa people sell some agricultural products or animal skins, they specify that they want "票子" and not "half-opening". Some people even exchange Renminbi for saving when they have "half-opening" in their hands.

The changes in Mengdong Street this year are too great! It is no longer a "free port" for foreign goods smuggling! It is no longer a conduit for imperialist economic aggression. It has become an economic hub for improving the lives of the people in the Kawa Mountain area, assisting production, and building the border area.

"Chairman Mao's Medicine"
This is a rare sunny day in the rainy season of Kawa Mountain. We followed Comrade Xiao Li of the Cangyuan County Health Institute to visit the villages. At this time last year, the comrades of the health institute could not go home day and night due to the prevalence of diseases. But what about last year? When we walked into every small bamboo house that was cleaned very clean, we saw the old米涛 (old mothers) sitting by the spinning wheel and humming as they spun cotton. "There are fewer diseases now. This is all because of Chairman Mao's good leadership!" The old米涛 affectionately pulled Xiao Li to sit beside them, asking Xiao Li to eat some rice noodles she made herself.

Because there were not many patients, we finished visiting two villages in less than an hour. Xiao Li thought of going to see her old干爹. This was an eighty-four-year-old Dai man. He was sitting by the fire pit drinking water. When he saw Xiao Li, he眯住眼 with happiness, smiling and cracking his toothless mouth and saying: "干女! I missed you when you didn't come." He turned around and said to an old普涛 (old man) next to him: "My leg wouldn't have been healed if I hadn't rubbed Chairman Mao's medicine!" As he said this, he looked at the picture of Chairman Mao that the health institute had given him that was pasted on the wall.

This old man originally suffered from lower extremity ulcers. He prayed to gods and Buddhas every day, but it didn't get better for more than three months, and the muscles were rotten and stinky. Later, after the comrades of the health institute gave him meticulous and patient treatment, changing the medicine every day, he finally recovered. He was so grateful that he led his granddaughter to the health institute to kowtow to Chairman Mao. From then on, he publicized everywhere that if you are sick, you should go to the doctors sent by Chairman Mao. Although it was difficult to walk, he personally picked the best pears from the pear tree and sent them to the comrades of the health institute.

It is not just this old man who loves the doctors sent by Chairman Mao. Everywhere we met people who said to us:

"I would have died without Chairman Mao!" "The Communist Party and Chairman Mao are better than 阿爹 阿妈!" In the past, people of these fraternal ethnic groups living in poor and backward areas would kill chickens and send them to ghosts when they got sick. Every year, I don’t know how many people were taken away by various infectious diseases such as dysentery and malaria. Every year during the summer and autumn, "谷花病" (infectious disease) swept into every village like a gust of wind. Every family was so sick that there was no one to cook, let alone take care of the autumn harvest! But what about now? This kind of disease has been greatly reduced. Grain production has increased in every village. The threat of hunger has become a memory for people. No wonder when people see the health worker, they give a thumbs up and say: "'衛生' (fraternal ethnic groups call health personnel 衛生) is good!" Some villages even want to build houses for the health workers to live in their villages forever. The "衛生" sent by Chairman Mao has become the most beloved relative of the fraternal ethnic groups.

These health work cadres did not gain the trust of the fraternal ethnic groups as soon as they arrived here. From the first day they came here, the white-clad soldiers on the frontier carried medicine bags and walked from this village to that village, from this district to that district. In the spring when hundreds of birds are singing, in the continuous rainy season, they climbed over one mountain after another, passed through one forest after another, waded across turbulent rivers, and walked through the muddy坝尾 (the end of the坝子) that reached their knees. During the day, they helped fraternal ethnic groups go to the fields to catch insects, dig ditches and canals, carry water and firewood; at night, they carried medicine bags and asked from house to house:

"Are there any patients here?" But the result was often rejection, and people would not let them in to treat the disease. But the comrades of the health institute were not discouraged. They repeatedly narrated Chairman Mao's concern for the fraternal ethnic groups, ate medicine themselves to show them, and gave themselves injections to explain that this was the only way to cure the disease. Because there was no hospital, they often ran dozens of miles to see patients, and sometimes guarded patients in small bamboo buildings for days and nights, taking care of everything from cooking to feeding medicine. In this way, they cured one person, two people... and gradually gained the trust of the fraternal ethnic groups. They also constantly publicized the importance of environmental hygiene, so that the fraternal ethnic groups gradually learned why people get sick and how to fight against diseases.

Now, whenever it is street day, the medicine stalls set up by the health institute are always surrounded by people who want medicine and injections. During the New Year and festivals, fraternal ethnic groups take bananas, eggs, and rice (these are precious items they use to respect ghosts and gods) and give them to the comrades of the health institute. They said: "We no longer believe in gods and ghosts. If we get sick in the future, we will come to you!"

Whenever "衛生日" comes to the village, everyone, big and small, comes to do sanitation. Those courtyards that have never been cleaned, and those paths where cow dung is one or two feet thick, become clean. Everyone said: "The sky is brighter, and the earth is bigger." There are also health workers, medicine delivery workers, and midwives of their own ethnic groups in the villages.

One day, after dinner, we went for a walk outside with the comrades in charge of the Cangyuan County Party Committee. We walked along the ridge to the hillside behind. At this time, the Dai children who were herding cattle had already driven the cattle back to the village. When we walked onto the small坝子靠山, we couldn't help but exclaim in surprise, because we had arrived in a natural garden. A flat and wide green grassland was surrounded by lush bushes. In the center of the grassland was a clear pond, and around the pond were various unknown big trees. Two ancient pine trees stood proudly on the bank of the pond. At this time, the comrades of the county party committee stood aside, smiling slightly triumphantly and said: "You didn't expect there to be such a good place!" He continued: "We have already planned it. In the future, we plan to build a hospital here, and build a cultural center near the hospital. This area will be planted with flowers, so that patients can come here to take a walk and play."

Looking at this green lawn, we thought of what Xiao Li of the health institute said to me: "We all have this ideal, that is, to build a socialist hospital in Kawa Mountain!"

Cultural Pioneers
Before liberation, the Kawa people had no schools and no people who could read. After liberation, this cultural wasteland was diligently reclaimed under the leadership of the Communist Party. By the first half of 1954, Cangyuan County had opened seven primary schools, five of which were located in the mountain villages where the Kawa people lived, with a total of nearly four hundred primary school students of various ethnic groups (the Kawa people accounted for 80%), learning the basic common sense of natural science and social science.

On August 8th last year, we had the opportunity to participate in the "Celebration Model Conference" of the county's cultural and educational work conference. We listened to the report on the deeds of the model teachers at the meeting, and visited Huang Lun after the meeting.

Huang Lun accepted the task of coming to Kawa Mountain to be a teacher shortly after graduating from Pu'er Normal School. In September 1952, he came to Henan. Although the primary school here had been opened a few months earlier, there were no full-time teachers, and the comrades of the work team taught the classes on their behalf. There were only twenty or so students. The entire school building was a large thatched shed, with no school supplies and incomplete textbooks. After Huang Lun arrived at the school, he led the students and mobilized the masses to cut bamboo and harvest grass to repair the school buildings and add desks, benches and beds. Many difficulties were overcome, but language barrier remained the biggest obstacle. Teachers could not speak the Kawa language and could not explain the content of the text clearly. Students could not gain knowledge in class and were not interested in reading. At first, even when class was over, the teacher could not express it clearly. The first method Huang Lun thought of was to throw the basketball outside, and the students knew it was time to play, and they ran out of the classroom in a swarm. Huang Lun realized that to complete the task assigned to him by the Party, he must gradually learn the language of the Kawa people. Therefore, before each class, in addition to preparing written lesson plans, he had to spend a lot of effort to learn the Kawa language necessary for this lesson. The textbook had chickens eating rice, so he found a chicken and a handful of rice, and asked the students who knew a little Chinese what it was called? He learned it over and over again before teaching this lesson. At the beginning, the pronunciation was inaccurate, which often caused the students to burst into laughter. However, after half a year of hard study, he not only mastered the general daily language, but also could use half of the Kawa language to explain when teaching. The students understood what he said, and the harvest of learning was also great. The Kawa children, who had lived in extreme poverty and backwardness for generations and had never been to school, had been able to recognize hundreds of Chinese characters in one or two years, and had also learned multiplication in arithmetic. The students' grades could reach the general level of students of the same grade in the mainland.

The teachers here not only have to teach students to read and write, but also have to teach students how to handle daily life. For example, they have to teach children how to wash their faces, take baths, and wash clothes, and teach children how to use chopsticks; for sick students, they also have to explain the causes of illness and the reason why they must take medicine to recover.

During their free time, the teachers also lead the students to reclaim land for production, plant corn and vegetables, and raise pigs and chickens. During the holidays, they often help the government distribute relief grain and winter clothes, and help the masses catch insects. The relationship between the teachers and the local masses is becoming closer day by day. When the school has difficulties, the masses automatically come to help solve them. The headman of Haiya saw that Nanla Primary School had a lot of leftover rice soup, so he sent two piglets to the school.

Because there are more than a dozen cultural pioneers like Huang Lun who have been cultivated by the Party, the seeds of culture can be sown, sprouted, and blossomed beautifully in this cultural wasteland of Kawa Mountain in a short period of more than two years.

"Unity Ditch"
When people walk into Nuoliang village, where the Mengsheng District Government of Cangyuan County is located, they can see layers of terraced fields surrounding the village. Leading to the village gate is a wide road about two zhang wide, lined with towering sugar pear trees. In the middle of the dense leaves, clusters of plump fruits sway enticingly, like an avenue shaded by trees in a park.

Before liberation, the Kawa people living in these beautiful villages lived a primitive life of "slash-and-burn farming." After burning the forests on the hillside, they casually used knives to dig up the soil and sow the grain seeds. A piece of land could be planted for at most three years. The land was very unstable, and there was no fertilization or weeding. They could harvest a few if they could, and eat for a few days if they could. In their own words: "Thunder响去栽秧, 谷黄去收割, 吃直饭, 做直活!" The harvest of one year is only enough to eat for three months to half a year. Due to the levy of grain and money by the Kuomintang reactionaries, they were often deprived of their only bit of food.

In the autumn of 1951, the People's Liberation Army wiped out the remnant bandits of Li Mi who were entrenched in the Mengsheng District; the cadres sent by the People's Government helped them organize their own joint defense armed forces to prevent the remnant bandits of Li Mi from coming to plunder again. When insect plagues came, they went to catch insects with them. When floods came, they went to build dams with them; they taught them to apply manure when planting crops, and to hoe rice seedlings when planting rice. The industrious and kind Kawa people used their own hands to create their own happiness, and their hands became more diligent. In the early morning, before breakfast, the sound of cowbells in the village resounded in unison, and people went to the fields early. Each village opened up pieces of fixed terraced fields, and these fields were used as public property. They said that they did not want to divide these fields, and that in the future they would use tractors to plow the land like the collective farms in Kunming.

With the development of production, all ethnic groups have become more united. The people of the Kawa ethnic group understand that only by uniting can they do a good job in production. Yong'e Village and Lameng Village in Mengsheng District were originally two connected villages. There is a ditch here that irrigates the land of the two villages. However, eight or nine years ago, the two villages were not united, and Yong'e Village cut off the ditch. Since then, Lameng Village has been threatened by drought every year. Last year, the People's Government gathered the people of the two villages together and explained to them: "In the past, the two villages were not united because the Kuomintang sent money to split the people, and the two villages pushed me and I pushed you, and everyone had no way out. Today, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, all ethnic groups are one family. Increasing grain production in Lameng is the same as increasing grain production in Yong'e. Everyone should discuss it carefully and open the ditch together." The production committee and joint defense captain of Yong'e Village immediately stood up and said: "There is no need to mention the past, it was all our fault, we only wanted our own village to be good. In the future, our two villages must unite!" The people of Lameng Village also said: "The Communist Party and Chairman Mao are our benefactors. We will do whatever the benefactors tell us to do!" Soon, the old and young of the two villages were mobilized, and they opened the ditch in three days. They named this ditch the Unity Ditch, and the rice fields along the ditch were transplanted on time for the first time in ten years.

Now, I don't know how many such unity ditches are interspersed in the fertile Kawa Mountain area.

    佧瓦山散记
    谭天　小珊　洛水
    政府、军队和人民
    云南省南大公路南涧临沧段通车以后，从昆明坐汽车到临沧——祖国的西南边城，只需要三、四天，再从临沧经过双江、耿马，步行十来天到沧源。这一带是康滇峡谷地带，夹在澜沧江、怒江中间，座落在怒江山脉上，三尖山、四排山、大雪山和公明山分布全境，南汀河、小黑江和南卡河南北纵横流入澜沧江和怒江，南面同缅甸接壤。这里是祖国西南的最边缘，号称千里国防的佧瓦山。
    一九五一年沧源县解放。
    沧源县物产丰富，出产旱谷、苞谷、水稻、紫胶、大豆树、黄果、芭蕉、菠萝和特别是有丰富的金银矿藏。居住在沧源县的有淳朴勤劳的佧瓦族、傣族和拉祜族人民，佧瓦族人最多。过去，在国民党反动派的压榨下，辛勤的劳动和富饶的自然条件并没有给各族人民带来幸福。
    解放以后，沧源县人民政府和驻当地的人民解放军不断地帮助各族人民。从一九五二年四月至今，沧源县人民政府贷给各族人民籽种二万多斤，兴修中小型水渠四十多条。前年驻军帮助农民捉虫，共捕虫六万六千二百零四斤，捕蛹二十八斤。农民普遍议论着：“过去，国民党要粮要款，不顾百姓的死活；今天，解放军烟都不吸我们的，冒着雨给我们捉虫，手破了也不休息，真是为我们少数民族做事的毛主席的好军队！”某部三连在日夜繁忙的警戒、营建任务中，抽空为驻地佧瓦族人民重盖了被李弥残匪烧掉的二十八座草房，开地十六亩。驻军还医好了佧瓦族的二千七百一十六个病人，给八百三十七人种了痘。人们说：“共产党、毛主席比我阿爹阿妈都好。”就这样，人民解放军的指战员和人民政府干部同当地各族人民逐渐建立了亲密的感情。
    雨季快到了，佧瓦山区的雨季特别长，当地人民都要在雨季前储备柴火，留在雨季烧用。这时寨子里的老年人和头人，估计解放军初来不了解当地的节令，就发动群众给解放军送柴火。第一次就有三匹牲口，百多人，背的背，驮的驮，兴高采烈地吆喝着，送来了一万多斤柴，接着第二、第三天，周围十多个寨子都陆续送柴来。他们起先不收报酬，经过部队同志的多次说服解释，才勉强地收些盐巴。
    群众打猎时回来，必然会喊着“老大”（称解放军、人民政府干部如家人），拿着一条兽腿或一只雉鸡，一起喝团结酒。去年全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团到达边疆时，他们送来象肉招待慰问团，还送来佧瓦挂包（代表心）、佧瓦刀（代表眼），表示对慰问团真诚的敬意。现在，在每个村寨内，如有生人来往，他们就立刻报告人民政府和解放军。坝卡寨佧瓦族老大，自动将残匪遗弃的六○炮弹十六发交给解放军，类似这样的事例很多。
    寨子内外常常可以听到“东方红”的歌声，到了夜晚，解放军同志就当起教员来了，教识字、教算术，有月亮的日子，大家还一起娱乐。寨内到处可以听见这样的话：“跟着共产党走，听毛主席的话。”
    “大军帮助我们，我们也要帮助大军……”
      一个市场的变化
    去年，我们重访了西南边疆沧源县的勐董——一个佧瓦山区的主要市场，内外货物的集散地。
    往年，勐董街子被称为“自由的商港”，是外货独霸的市场。这里没有海关，没有国家的税卡；各国的货物都可以自由输入，金银土特产也可自由输出。因此，勐董便成为那些走私漏税、投机倒把的私贩、商人、冒险家的乐园。街上摆满着花花绿绿的外货摊子。这些外形漂亮、品质低劣的走私品，不知骗去多少兄弟民族的劳动血汗。一到雨季，商人立即趁机囤积商品，抬高物价来谋取暴利。平时盐每百斤只卖六十元“半开”（当五角的银元），雨季会涨到一百二十元左右。一般穷苦的群众零星买着吃，更比平时要多出三倍的价钱。所以大多数人家，都是尽可能在雨季里不买东西。雨季的街期，便非常的萧条。
    我们在勐董逗留时，正当雨季。雨整日淅淅沥沥地下着，坝子里道路上的泥沼，深陷到膝盖上下。由于山洪暴发，许多道路桥梁都被冲毁，这里和内地、四乡的交通几乎断绝了。八月初一的一个街期，我们冒着滂沱的大雨去赶街子，一路上想着：历年雨季赶街的人极少，今天雨这么大，恐怕更没人来吧。谁知完全出乎我们意料之外。变了！这天不仅街上的人很多，而且市场非常活跃。
    国营贸易公司沧源支公司的门前，拥挤着穿各种服饰的各族人民。他们一边听扩音器里放送着悠扬的苗族歌曲，一边张望货架上满摆的货物；还有很多人手里拿着，怀里抱着刚购买的布疋、上衣、斧头、砍刀……他们都挂着笑容。
    这个变化，从前年的雨季就开始了，不过去年的变化更大。前年贸易组（支公司还没成立）在雨季前，从保山临沧等地调运来了大批货物，保证了雨季中的供应，稳定了物价，私商趁雨季谋取暴利的企图落空了。去年贸易公司、盐业公司、粮食局售粮处相继成立开业，人民生活必需品储备充足，日用商品种类达六百一十种。南大公路通车到临沧，运费减低，在雨季中各货不仅没有涨价，反而有许多品种降低了两次牌价。这些祖国工厂生产的价廉物美的商品，受到各族人民热烈欢迎。一个傣族的老大爷指着贸易公司的花布说：“我活了六十多岁了，从来没有见到这么多、这么好的花布。”现在街旁花花绿绿的外货摊子渐渐少了。前年六月，人民政府规定了只有对当地人民生活有利的商品才准进口；中国商人进口的货物由政府全部收购统销。
    在新建的粮食局售粮处门口，我们看到了百十个背着竹篓、麻袋的佧瓦族、拉祜族等各族男女，他们有的在交款，有的聚精会神抓起别人买的米来看，赞不绝口。我们问了一个会说一点汉话的佧瓦族老乡：“米好不好？卖多少一斤？”他笑着回答：“好！好！一斤米，一吊（一千）六百元，毛主席领导得好！米不涨价了！”街子的另一端还有一个比较热闹的地方，就是盐业公司摆的盐摊子旁边。往年缺盐吃是佧瓦山区灾荒之一，穷苦人家，如有四两重的一块盐巴，就当成宝贝，用绳子拴起吊着，做汤菜时，放锅里蘸一蘸就马上拿出来。这四两盐几乎要吃一两个月。现在勐董的售盐处，不算平时售出和批发的盐，光只街子一天就要卖出八十?（一?三斤）到二百?。从这个数字，我们可以看出缺盐吃的灾荒，已经根本不存在了。
    雨渐渐地停了。我们在街子上观光一周后，才慢慢察觉出有一个重要的变化，就是叮叮当当的
  “半开”敲打的响声，少得几乎听不到了。前年春季这个市场还完全是“半开”阵地，人民币只在机关、部队和贸易组等国营企业间流通。现在变了！佧瓦山区几个街子，如黄角，岩帅、南腊……等地，人民币已经取得各族人民的绝对信任，平均百分之八十左右的流通额都是人民币。佧瓦族人民售出一些农产品或兽皮时，都指明要“票子”不要“半开”。甚至手中有“半开”的还调换人民币保存。
    勐董街子这一年的变化太大了！这里再也不是外货走私的“自由港”了！这里再也不是帝国主义经济侵略的孔道了。它已经变成一个改善佧瓦山区人民生活、辅助生产、建设边疆的经济枢纽了。
      “毛主席的药”
    这是佧瓦山雨季中难得的一个晴天。我们随着沧源县卫生院的小李同志下去串寨子。前年这个时候，由于疾病流行，卫生院的同志们日夜不得回家。可是去年呢？当我们走进每一间打扫得很干净的小竹屋时，都看到老米涛（老大妈）们坐在纺车边嗡嗡地纺着棉花。“现在病少多了，这都是毛主席领导得好啊！”老米涛亲热地拉着小李坐在她们的身边，要小李吃一点她亲手做的米粉。
    由于病人不多，不到一个钟头，我们就串完了两个寨子。小李想起要去看看她们的老干爹。这是一位八十四岁的傣族老大爹，他正坐在火塘边烧水喝，一见小李，高兴得眯住眼，笑裂着没有牙的嘴说：“干女！不见你来，想你了。”他又转过身去对着旁边的一位老普涛（老大爷）说：“我这腿，不是擦毛主席的药，不得好了！”他一边说，一边望着墙上贴的卫生院送他的毛主席像。
    这位老大爹原是患下肢溃疡，每天求神拜佛，三个多月也不见好，肌肉都腐臭了。后来经过卫生院同志们替他细致耐心的治疗，天天换药，终于痊愈了。他感激得领着外孙女儿到卫生院去找毛主席磕头。从此以后，他到处宣传生病要找毛主席派去的医生看。虽然走路很困难，他还是亲自把梨树上最好的梨子摘下来送给卫生院的同志们。
    这里并不只是这位老大爷一个人这样热爱毛主席派去的医生。我们到处遇到这样的人对我们说：
  “没有毛主席，我早死了！”“共产党、毛主席比阿爹阿妈还好！”过去，这些住在贫困落后地区的兄弟民族的人民，生了病就杀鸡送鬼，每年不知有多少人让痢疾、疟疾等各种各样的流行病夺去生命。每当夏秋之际，“谷花病”（流行病）像一阵风一样吹进了每一个寨子，家家都病得连烧火煮饭的人都没有，哪里还顾得上秋收！可是现在呢？这种病大大减少了。村村寨寨粮食都增产。饥饿的威胁，成为人们记忆中的事了。难怪人们一见到卫生员的时候，就翘起大拇指说：“‘卫生’（兄弟民族简称卫生人员为卫生）好！”有的寨子还要修房子让卫生员永远住在他们寨子里。毛主席派来的
  “卫生”成为兄弟民族最喜爱的亲人了。
    这些卫生工作干部并不是一到这儿就得到兄弟民族的信任的。边疆的白衣战士们，从来到这里的第一天起，就背起药包，从这个寨走到那个寨，从这个区走到那个区。在百鸟齐鸣的春天，在绵绵不断的雨季，他们翻过一座座的大山，穿过一片片的森林，涉过湍急的河水，走过泥沼及膝的坝尾（坝子的末端）。白天帮助兄弟民族下地捉虫，挖沟开渠，挑水扛柴；夜晚便背起药包，一家家去询问：
  “你们这里有没有病人？”但结果往往遭到拒绝，人们不让他们进去治病。可是卫生院的同志们并不灰心，他们一遍遍地叙述着毛主席对兄弟民族的关心，亲口吃药给他们看，自己给自己打针来说明只有这样才能治病。由于没有病院，他们经常跑几十里路去给病人看病，有时在小竹楼里几天几夜地守护着病人，从煮饭到喂药都是他们。就这样，他们治好了一个人、两个人……逐渐得到了兄弟民族的信任。他们还不断宣传环境卫生的重要，使兄弟民族渐渐地知道了人为什么会生病，怎样去同疾病作斗争。
    现在，每当街期的时候，卫生院摆的药摊子面前，总是围满了人，要药吃，要打针。过年过节的时候，兄弟民族就拿着芭蕉、鸡蛋、米（这都是他们敬鬼神的珍贵物品）送给卫生院的同志们。他们说：“我们不信神信鬼了，以后有病就找你们！”
    寨子里一到“卫生日”，大大小小都来搞卫生，那些从来就没有打扫过的院坝，那些牛粪积有一二尺厚的小路上，都变得干干净净的了。大家都说：“天也亮了，地也大了。”寨子里也有了自己民族的卫生员、送药员和接生员。
    一天，晚饭后我们随着沧源县委负责同志到外面去散步。我们顺着田埂向后山坡走去。这时，放牛的傣族儿童已经赶着牛回寨子了。当我们走上了靠山的那个小平坝子时，不禁惊喜得叫了起来，原来我们到了一个天然的花园里来了。一块平坦宽阔的青草地，被茂盛的灌木丛圈起来，草地中央是一个明净的池塘，池塘的周围是各种不知名的大树，两棵古松傲然地挺立在池畔。这时，县委的同志站在一旁，微带得意地笑着说：“你们没想到会有这样好的地方吧！”他接着说：“我们早已计划好了，将来准备在这里盖一所医院，并且在医院附近建立一所文化馆，这一带都栽上花，可以让病人到这里来散步和游玩。”
    我们看着这一片绿茸茸的草坪，想起卫生院小李和我说的话：“我们都有这种理想，就是要在佧瓦山建立起社会主义的医院！”
    文化拓荒者
    解放前，佧瓦族没有学校和读书的人。解放后，这片文化荒土在共产党的领导下，就被辛勤地垦殖着。到一九五四年上半年，沧源县就已开办了七所小学校，其中有五所设在聚居着佧瓦族的山寨里，共计有近四百个各民族的（佧瓦族占百分之八十）小学生，学着初步的自然科学和社会科学的常识。
    去年八月八日，我们有机会参加了县文教工作会议的“庆贺模范大会”。在会上听了关于模范教员的事迹的报告，会后并访问了黄伦。
    黄伦在普洱师范学校毕业不久，就接受来佧瓦山当教员的任务。一九五二年九月，他来到贺南，这里小学虽然早在几个月以前就开办了，但没有专任教员，由工作组的同志代为上课。学生也只有二十几个人。全部校舍是一大间草棚，没有校具，课本也不全。黄伦到校以后，领导学生，发动群众，砍竹子、割草，修补校舍，添制桌凳床铺。克服了许多困难，可是语言不通，却仍是一个最大的壁障。教员不会讲佧瓦话，不能把课文内容讲解明白，学生上课得不到知识，对读书没有兴趣。起初连下课时间到了，教师也没办法表示明白。黄伦起初想的办法是把篮球向外面一扔，学生们就知道该是玩的时间了，才一哄而散地跑出教室去。黄伦认识到要完成党交给他的任务，必须逐渐学会佧瓦族的语言，因此在每次上课之前，除了做好文字教案外，还要用许多工夫把这一课所必需的佧瓦话学会。课本上有小鸡吃米，他就找一只小鸡一把米，问那稍懂汉话的学生叫什么？一遍一遍的学会了，才去讲这一课。开始时发音不准，常惹起学生哄堂大笑。但他经过半年的艰苦学习，不仅一般生活上的语言运用得纯熟了，而且在授课时可以用一半的佧瓦话讲解。学生听懂了话，学习的收获也就大了。祖祖代代一直过着极端贫穷落后的生活，从来没有进过学校的佧瓦族儿童们，已能在一两年内认识几百个汉字，算术也学到乘法，学生成绩能够达到内地同级学生一般的水平。
    这里的教员不仅要教学生读书识字，还得教学生处理生活琐事。例如要教孩子们洗脸、洗澡、洗衣服，教孩子们怎样用筷子；对生病的学生还要讲解生病的原因和必须吃药才可以痊愈的道理。
    教员们在课外的时间，还领导学生开荒生产，种苞谷、菜蔬，养猪养鸡。在假期里，他们还经常帮助政府发放救济粮、冬衣，帮助群众捕虫等。教员同当地群众的关系一天天密切起来，学校有困难，群众都自动来帮助解决。海牙头人见南腊小学的剩饭米汤很多，就送两只小猪给学校。
    因为有了党培养出来的像黄伦这样的十几个文化拓荒者，佧瓦山这片文化荒土上，才能够在短短的两年多时间里，撒下文化的种子，发了芽，并且开出了美丽的花朵。
      “团结沟”
    当人们走进沧源县猛省区政府所在的诺良寨子时，可以看到层层的梯田环绕着寨子，通往寨门的是一条宽约二丈的大路，路旁长满了高耸入云的糖梨树，浓密的树叶中间，串串丰满的果实诱人地摇摆着，好像是公园里的林荫大道。
    解放前，住在这样一些美丽寨子里的佧瓦族人民，过着原始的“刀耕火种”的生活。他们把山坡上的树林烧光以后，就随便用刀子挖开土，撒上谷种。一块地顶多能种三年，土地很不固定，也不施肥，不除草，能收几颗算几颗，能吃几天算几天。用他们自己的话说：“雷响去栽秧，谷黄去收割，吃直饭，做直活！”一年的收成只够吃三个月到半年。由于国民党反动派派粮派款，往往把他们仅有的一点口粮剥夺干净。
    一九五一年秋季，解放大军消灭了盘据在猛省区的李弥残匪；人民政府派来的干部帮助他们组织了自己的联防武装，不让李弥残匪再来抢掠，虫灾来了，和他们一齐去捉虫，洪水来了，和他们一起去打坝；教给他们种庄稼要上粪，种稻子要薅秧，豌豆子要撒得整整齐齐，棉花枝要好好修理。勤劳、善良的佧瓦族人民用自己的双手来创造自己的幸福，手变得更勤快了。清晨，还没吃饭，寨子里的牛铃声响成一片，人们早早就上地去了。每个寨子都开出了一块块固定的梯田，这些田都作为公共的。他们讲，这些田我们不愿分了，将来要像昆明的集体农庄一样，用拖拉机来犁地。
    随着生产的发展，各民族也团结得更紧密了。佧瓦族的人民懂得了只有大家团结才能搞好生产。猛省区的永峨寨和拉猛寨，原来是两个相联的寨子。这里有一条水沟灌溉着两寨的土地。可是八、九年前两个寨子闹不团结，永峨寨就把沟截断了。自此以后，拉猛寨每年都被干旱威胁着。去年，人民政府把两个寨子的人都召集到一起，对他们解释说：“过去，两个寨子不团结，是因为国民党派门户钱，两个寨子你推我，我推你，大家都没办法。今天，在毛主席领导下，各族人民都是一家人了。拉猛增产粮食和永峨增产粮食是一样的。大家要好好商量，共同开沟。”永峨寨的生产委员和联防队长立刻站了出来说：“过去的事不用提了，都是我们的不对，只想自己寨子好，今后我们两个寨子要团结！”拉猛寨的人也说：“共产党和毛主席是我们的恩人，恩人叫我们怎么做就怎么做！”很快地两个寨的老老小小都发动起来了，三天就把沟开好，他们把这个沟取名为团结沟，沿沟的稻田十年来第一次按时插了秧。
    现在，已经不知有多少这样的团结沟，穿插在肥沃的佧瓦山区。
