To strengthen academic cooperation between doctors of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Western medicine, the head office of the Chinese Medical Association recently issued instructions requiring local branches to admit TCM doctors as members. The head office of the Chinese Medical Association, along with the Ministry of Health, the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies, and the Chinese Medicine Association, have specifically researched and discussed the issue of admitting TCM doctors as members. Currently, ten TCM doctors, including Xiao Longyou, Shi Jinmo, Kong Bohua, and Zhao Shuping, have been admitted as the first group of members by the head office of the Chinese Medical Association.
