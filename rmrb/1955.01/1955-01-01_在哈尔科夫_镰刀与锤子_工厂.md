    At the "Hammer and Sickle" Factory in Kharkov
    Ma Nan
    December 3, 1954, was a rare sunny day in the half-month since we entered Soviet territory. The warm, golden sunlight shone on the magnificent buildings of the city of Kharkov. Kyiv, which we passed through three days earlier, was still covered in white snow, but here, only six hundred kilometers away, it felt as if the snow was beginning to melt, and spring was near.
    The male and female comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe visited the "Hammer and Sickle" factory in Kharkov with joy and respect.
    From the huge iron gate and the appearance of the massive, mountain-like buildings, my first impression was that I was looking at a magnificent and large-scale institution of learning. In my limited experience, factories were places with black, smoking chimneys, but here there were no chimneys, the air was fresh, and the environment was quiet. It was hard to find any trace of smoke or dust.
    The gatekeeper opened the iron gate, and our group got out of the cars and walked towards the open courtyard. On both sides of the factory yard were production record boards. The portraits of advanced producers and model workers were framed in glass, with figures and percentages showing their labor achievements.
    The "Hammer and Sickle" factory is the largest combine engine manufacturing plant in Ukraine and one of the most famous agricultural machinery manufacturing plants in the Soviet Union. It completed the process of modernization and automation technology transformation during the grand Fourth Five-Year Plan. It possesses first-class production technology. In the competition to shorten auxiliary labor time, it created new records, reducing the auxiliary labor time of production by one-half to two-thirds. In addition to combine engines, the "Hammer and Sickle" factory also produces combine harvesters. During the fifth anniversary of our National Day, the engines for the combine harvesters and four combine harvesters sent to our country by the Soviet government delegation were produced by this factory.
    This factory has a long history. Before the October Revolution, during the dark ages of the Tsarist government, it was a tool for foreign capital to exploit Russia. After the Great October Socialist Revolution, Lenin personally signed an order to take it back from the reactionary foreign capitalists and transfer it to the ownership of all the Soviet people. Today, a huge frame at the entrance of the factory canteen contains a copy of the order personally signed by Comrade Lenin to confiscate the factory.
    During the Great Patriotic War, the "Hammer and Sickle" factory, like other factories and buildings in Kharkov, was destroyed by German fascists. However, after the victory of the Great Patriotic War, it was quickly restored by the Soviet people and stood on Soviet soil with a new look. New, fully automated production equipment replaced the old, heavy equipment. When we visited, we saw that the workers in the electrical hardening and cooling workshop stood easily beside the furnace. With a simple press of a switch, the furnace door would open automatically, and a crane would transport the hardened iron blocks to another production department. This workshop, like all the workshops, was well-lit, the room temperature was suitable, and the air was very fresh. Here, the stoker no longer had to engage in heavy labor while sweating profusely. In a universal workshop, thirty-six lathes could be operated by only four people. With the press of a button by the workers, materials were transported sequentially to each production section by an automatically rotating track. Then, the finished product would come out with the operation of the track. The workers confidently told me: "We are no longer manual laborers, but technical intellectuals who are proficient in the construction and performance of all complex machines."
    We met Andrei Ivanovich, a 67-year-old veteran worker in the factory. He was an old man with white hair, but he was still full of energy and devoted to his work. When we visited the iron smelting furnace repair workshop he led, he kindly stopped us and talked endlessly about his history and production, regardless of whether the Chinese guests could understand him. Like a grandfather telling stories to his grandchildren, he put his hand on the shoulders of the Chinese boys and girls, walking and talking; when he was excited, he occasionally let out the hearty and amiable laughter characteristic of Russians. It turned out that he had been working here for fifty years. He was an apprentice here in the Tsarist era. He actively participated in the revolutionary struggles during the October Revolution and the subsequent wars. Under the education of the Soviet Communist Party, he transformed from an ordinary worker into a production expert, leading the technicians in the iron smelting furnace repair workshop. Under his leadership and organization, his workshop frequently saved coal and gasoline, for which he was repeatedly rewarded by the factory. He trained batches and batches of technicians. Comrade Sergei Rachenko, the secretary of the factory party committee, said of the old technician's contribution: "His students have trained students, and he is called the grandfather of our factory!"
    Comrade Ivanovich smiled and held his Chinese children with both hands, reluctantly sending us out of his workshop. From this kind old man, we were all moved and attracted by the Soviet people's love for life and optimism. When we pinned commemorative badges with Chairman Mao's portrait on his chest, Ivanovich bent down and used his large, strong hands to cup my head and kiss my face. My heart was completely stirred by the love of this Soviet grandfather and I could not calm down for a long time.
    After visiting several major workshops, we walked out of the warm factory buildings and walked in the factory yard, which was called Factory Street. If it were spring instead of the dead of winter, the green leaves on the branches on both sides of the road would cover the road, forming a shaded avenue. On both sides of this Factory Street were two streams of water released from the high-speed cutting workshop to cool down, spraying constantly in the spray pool like a fountain. The water falling around the spray pool congealed into many pointed, snow-white ice pillars in the cold wind. How beautiful! Who says this is just a factory and not a beautifully constructed park? I asked Comrade Sergei, the secretary of the factory party committee, again: "Why can't you see a chimney or a speck of smoke in such a big factory?" The answer was: "Because the entire factory has been electrified, there is no need for chimneys."
    The workers' canteen was a large hall with plenty of light and facing south, with huge glass windows. As soon as you opened the door, you could smell the steaming aroma of food. The hall was very long, with rows of square tables covered with snow-white tablecloths. The workers had just finished work and came into the restaurant in twos and threes, each choosing their favorite dishes from the menu. They ate their meals at tables of three or two. There were large plates of beef, potatoes, cream of vegetable soup, fried meat patties, pork chops, and various sweet and sour breads—a very rich lunch indeed. I went to a table and curiously asked a worker: How much does such a lunch cost? He held up three fingers, meaning three rubles. A worker only needs to spend more than two hundred rubles a month on food. In the Soviet Union, it is very common for a worker to earn more than a thousand rubles a month, and some Stakhanovites can even earn tens of thousands of rubles!
    As we were watching the workers having their meals in a daze, the old head cook, Grovin Nikolayevich, wearing a snow-white work uniform, came over with a smile and invited us to visit their kitchen with modern electrical equipment.
    Grovin Nikolayevich has been working as a cook in this factory for forty-seven years. Although he is already sixty-nine years old this year, he still looks very strong due to his humorous speech and optimistic mood, seeming to be no more than forty or fifty years old at most. Comrade Sergei, the secretary of the factory party committee, told us: Nikolayevich has contributed greatly to the meals of the entire factory, working at his cooking post for forty-seven years as a day. For this, he has been awarded the honorary title of "Cooking Expert" by the state, and receives an additional 30% bonus to his salary every month.
    More than thirty of us followed this old cook into the electrified and mechanized kitchen that he was proud of. The kitchen was adjacent to the restaurant and was also a very large hall, including the cooking stove area, the storage area, and the office area. A glass wall as high as the ceiling divided the hall into two halves, and the half on the right was divided into six or seven small rooms. The old cook pointed to the first small room at the entrance of the hall and said that it was his office. My gaze followed the direction of his finger and saw a large desk placed in a corner near the window, with stationery on it. There was also an oak tree with lush, dark green leaves in another corner. In addition, there were sofas and chairs for resting, furnished elegantly and simply. This scene made it hard for me to believe that this was in the cook's room. I couldn't help but admire in my heart: "This is socialism!" Going further inside, there was a meat cold storage room, a vegetable room, a fish cold storage room, a bread storage room… Each cold storage room had huge electric refrigerators, almost half the size of the room, glass display cabinets, and some unknown utensils.
    After visiting each small room, we visited the other part of the hall—the cooking area. There were two rows of shiny, round gas pots, some for making soup, some for cooking vegetables, and some for boiling water. Each pot was trailed by a thick black wire. This shows that everything here is electrified. At one end of the hall was a huge iron plate, as large as a room, and a female cook was rolling up her sleeves and working. When we approached, we realized that the iron plate contained more than a dozen bread ovens and kilns. The female cook opened and closed the bread baking boxes quickly, like the most skilled textile workers checking the spindles on a loom. It was true that even baking bread was mechanized.
    We walked all over the large kitchen, without seeing any greasy dirt or smoke, nor any dirty water (there was a separate washing room for washing pots and dishes). The walls were all lined with white porcelain tiles, and the staff were all dressed in white clothes. If one did not know in advance that it was a kitchen, one would surely think that it was a hospital!
    Comrade Sergei also specifically told us that this factory also has a club that can accommodate more than two hundred people, a large auditorium that can accommodate six hundred people,
  a children's palace that can accommodate seven hundred and fifty children, and a well-equipped stadium.
    After the visit, the song and dance troupe gave a small-scale performance in the workers' club and had a party with the workers. Every song we sang received thunderous applause and cheers from the workers. At the end of the party, amidst the applause, the factory designer, Kliat Bavieyo Ivanovich, gave a replica sculpture that had won a first prize in a competition in Paris to the Chinese guests as a souvenir for them to always remember them.
    Just as people were crowding around us as we stepped out of the auditorium, the singing of the female chorus of the song and dance troupe suddenly sounded again in the factory yard. While we were feeling astonished, the host told us: "Your speeches and songs have all been recorded just now, and now they are being broadcast to the entire factory."

    在哈尔科夫“镰刀与锤子”工厂
    马楠
    一九五四年十二月三日是我们进入苏联国境半月以来稀有的一个晴天，和暖的金黄色的阳光照耀着哈尔科夫市巍峨的建筑物。三天以前我们所路过的基辅还是白雪皑皑，而仅仅隔着六百公里的这里，却彷佛已是积雪开始融化的春天了。
    中国人民解放军歌舞团的男女同志们怀着愉快和崇敬的心情前往哈尔科夫“镰刀与锤子”工厂去访问。
    从巨大的铁栅栏门，从一幢幢大山似的楼房的外表看去，它给予我的直接印象是：在我眼前的倒像是一所建筑宏伟、规模巨大的学府。因为在我的狭隘的经验中，只有那些黑烟突突、烟囱林立的地方才是工厂，而这里却看不到烟囱，空气清新，环境幽静，简直找不到一点烟尘。
    守门的人把铁栅栏门打开了，我们大队人员随即走出汽车，向着开阔的院落走去。厂院两旁竖立着一块块的生产纪录牌，在玻璃镜框内镶有先进生产者和劳动模范的肖像，并标着许多说明他们劳动成就的数字和百分比。
    “镰刀与锤子”工厂是乌克兰最大的康拜因发动机制造厂，也是全苏著名的农业机械制造厂之一。它是在宏伟的第四个五年计划中完成现代化和自动化技术改造过程的工厂。它具有头等的生产技术；在缩短辅助劳动时间的竞赛中，曾经创造过新的纪录，使生产的辅助劳动时间缩短了二分之一到三分之二。“镰刀与锤子”工厂除了出产康拜因发动机之外，还出产联合收割机。我国国庆五周年纪念时，苏联政府代表团送给我国的康拜因机上的发动机和四架联合收割机就是这个工厂的出品。
    这个工厂有着悠久的历史。十月革命之前，在沙皇政府统治的黑暗年代，它原是外国资本在俄国的吸血工具。伟大十月社会主义革命之后，列宁亲自签署命令，把它从反动的外国资本家手里夺回来，转为全体苏维埃人民所有。如今工厂食堂门口竖立的一个巨幅镜框内就嵌有列宁同志当时亲手签署的没收这个工厂的命令。
    在卫国战争期间，“镰刀与锤子”工厂像哈尔科夫的其他工厂和建筑物一样，遭到了德国法西斯的破坏。但在卫国战争胜利之后，它由苏联人民迅速地恢复起来了，而且以更加崭新的面貌耸立在苏维埃国土上。全部自动化的新式生产装备代替了过去的陈旧笨重的设备。我们参观时看到：电气加固和冷却车间工人轻松地站在炉旁，只要轻轻地按动一个开关，炉门就自动打开，吊车就会把加固的铁块送到另一个生产部门。这个车间和所有的车间一样，光线很充足，室内温度适宜，空气非常清爽。在这里，司炉工人再不要汗流浃背地从事沉重劳动了。在一个万能车间里，三十六部车床只要四个人操纵就行了。工人一按电钮，材料就由自动旋转的履带逐次运送到各个生产部分。而后随着履带运转出来的便是成品。工人同志十分自信地对我说：“我们现在已不是体力劳动者，而是精通技术的脑力劳动者了，我们懂得全部复杂机器的构造及性能。”
    我们会见了厂里的一个六十七岁的老工人安得烈·伊凡诺维奇。他已是须发苍苍的老人了，可还是精神饱满，全心全意地从事着自己的工作。在我们参观他所领导的熔铁炉修理车间时，他也不管中国客人是否能听懂他的话，非常亲切地拦住我们，滔滔不绝地讲起他的历史和生产上的事情来了。他像老祖父对儿孙们讲故事一样，把他的手搭在中国男女孩子们的肩膀上，边走边谈；谈到兴奋的地方，间或发出高声的俄罗斯人所特有的那种爽朗可亲的笑声。原来他已经在这里作了五十年工了。还在沙皇时代，他就在这里做学徒，十月革命及其以后的战争中，他都积极地参加了革命斗争，在苏联共产党的教养下，他由一个普通工人成为生产能手，领导着熔铁炉修理车间的技工。在他的领导和组织之下，他的车间经常节约煤和汽油，为此他曾多次受到工厂的奖励。他曾培养了一批又一批的技工。工厂党委书记谢尔盖·拉琴克同志在谈到这位老技工的贡献时说：“他培养的学生又培养了学生，他被称为我们工厂的老祖父！”
    伊凡诺维奇同志笑盈盈地用双手拉着他的中国孩子们，难舍难分地一直把我们送出他的车间大门以外。从这位慈祥的老人身上，我们都为苏维埃人对于生活的热爱和乐观情绪所感动，所吸引。当我们把有毛主席肖像的纪念章别在他胸前时，伊凡诺维奇就弯下腰来，用他肥大有力的双手捧着我的头在我脸上亲吻，我的内心完全被这位苏联老祖父的慈爱激动得久久不能平伏。
    参观了几个主要的车间以后，我们走出温暖的厂房，在被称为工厂街的厂院内走着。如果不是隆冬而是春天，路两旁树枝上的绿叶就会把道路遮盖起来成了林荫道了。在这个工厂街的两旁有两个从高速切削车间放出来用以冷却的水，像喷泉一样不停地冒着热气在喷池内喷射着。落在喷池四周的水在冷风中凝结为许多尖尖的雪白冰柱，真是多么美啊！谁说这只是工厂，而不是漂亮别致的、精心修建起来的公园呢？我再一次问工厂党委书记谢尔盖同志：“这样大的工厂为什么看不到一个烟囱和一点烟尘呢”？回答是：“因为整个工厂已经实行了电气化，用不着烟囱了”。
    工人食堂是一个光线十分充足，座北向阳的大厅，窗子上嵌着巨大的玻璃，一推开门，就闻到一股扑鼻的热腾腾的食品香味。大厅很长，一排排的方桌上铺着雪白的桌布。工人们刚下班，三三两两陆陆续续走进餐厅来，每一个人从菜单上挑选自己最喜欢的菜。他们三人一桌，两人一桌地吃着自己的份菜。有大碟的牛肉，土豆，奶油菜汤，煎肉饼，猪排，各种酸甜面包，——真是一顿非常丰富的午餐。我走到一张桌前，好奇地问一个工人：这样一顿午餐要多少钱？他伸出三个手指比划，意思是三个卢布。一个工人一个月的伙食费只需化二百多卢布就够了。在苏联，一个工人一个月拿千多个卢布的工资是很普遍的，有的斯大哈诺夫工作者甚至还能拿到上万卢布呢！
    当我们正在出神地看工人同志进餐的时候，穿着雪白工作服的老炊事长格罗温·尼古莱维奇笑嘻嘻地过来请我们去参观他们有现代化电气设备的炊事房。
    格罗温·尼古莱维奇在这个工厂担任炊事工作已经四十七年了，虽然他今年已经是六十九岁的老人了，但是由于他说话诙谐，情绪乐观，看起来还是很健壮的，似乎顶多不过四、五十岁。工厂党委书记谢尔盖同志告诉我们：尼古莱维奇在他的炊事工作岗位上四十七年如一日，对全厂的工人伙食很有贡献，为此，他曾荣获国家给予的“炊事能手”的光荣称号，并在他的薪水之外每月增加百分之三十的奖励金。
    我们三十多个同志跟在这位老炊事长的身后，走进他引为自豪的电气化机械化的炊事房。这炊事房紧接餐厅，也是一个很宽大的大厅，其中包括烹调的锅灶部分、贮藏部分和办公部分。一道高及天花板的玻璃墙把大厅辟为两半，右首的一半又横隔为六七个小房间，老炊事长指点着大厅入口处的第一间小房子说，那是他的办公室。我的目光跟着他的手指的方向望过去，看到一张大写字台放在临窗的一角，上面放着文具。另一个墙角还有一棵长了茂密浓绿大叶子的橡树。此外还有可供休息的沙发椅子，陈设风雅而朴素。这景象使我简直不能相信这是在炊事长的房里。我不禁在心里暗暗赞叹：“这就是社会主义！”再朝里走，就是肉类冷藏室，蔬菜室，鱼类冷藏室，面包库……各个冷藏室都有巨大的几乎占去半间屋大的电气冰箱、玻璃厨柜以及一些不知名的器皿。
    参观完各个小屋之后又参观大厅的另一部分——烹调间。这里有两排光亮的圆圆的气锅，有的用来烧汤，有的烧菜，有的烧水。每个锅下都拖有一条粗粗的黑皮线。这说明这里的一切都是电气化的。大厅的一端是一面巨大的铁板，足有一间屋那么大，一个女炊事员正卷起袖口在工作。我们走近时一看，才知道那铁板里面就是十多个面包烤箱和烘炉。女炊事员像最熟练的纺织工人检查车床上的纱锭一样，迅速地开闭着一个个烤面包的箱子。真是连烤面包也都机械化了。
    我们走遍了大炊事间，没有看见一点油腻和烟尘，也没有看见一点脏水（刷洗锅碗另有单独的洗涤间）。这里的四壁全都镶着白磁砖，工作人员全都穿着白衣服，如果不是事先知道是炊事间的话，人们准会以为这是一所医院呢！
    谢尔盖同志还特别告诉我们，这个工厂还有可容二百多人的俱乐部，一个容纳六百人的大礼堂，
  一个能容纳七百五十个孩子的儿童宫，一个设备完善的体育场。
    参观以后，歌舞团就在工人俱乐部里作小型的演唱并和工人们联欢。我们演唱的每一支歌曲，都得到了工人们的雷鸣似的掌声和欢呼。联欢结束，在掌声中工厂设计师克里雅特·巴维约·伊凡诺维奇把一件在巴黎比赛中得过一等奖的复制雕刻送给中国客人作为永远记着他们的纪念品。
    正当人们蜂拥着我们步出礼堂时，厂院内突然又响起刚才歌舞团女声小合唱的歌声来，我们正在感到惊愕的时候，主人告诉我们说：“刚才已经把你们的讲话和歌唱全部录音下来了，现在是向全厂广播”。
