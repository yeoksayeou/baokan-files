    Northeast China Conducts Preliminary Survey of Three Wasteland Areas
    In the last three months of 1954, the Land Survey Department of the Northeast State Farm Administration, with the participation of personnel from the Northeast Soil Research Institute, completed comprehensive surveys of three land reclamation areas. These three areas are: the Hulin area north and south of the Muling River, the triangular area east of Fujin extending to the Ussuri River, and the area east of the Nen River and north of the Nemur River. Surveyors conducted preliminary investigations on a total area of approximately 2.6 million hectares. They not only gained a preliminary understanding of the terrain and recorded wild plants, but also collected soil samples for analysis and research on the soil of the area. As a result of this series of works, it was learned that in the above three regions, approximately 400,000 hectares of wasteland not only have fertile soil, but also have good terrain and can be reclaimed immediately. There are also approximately 900,000 hectares of wasteland that can be utilized with only slight drainage engineering. In May of this year, a formal survey team will be dispatched to conduct regular and thorough surveys in the Muling River and Nen River areas first, in preparation for large-scale land reclamation.

    东北初步调查了三处荒地
    在一九五四年最后三个月，东北国营农场管理局土地勘测处在东北土壤研究所人员参加下，完成了三个开荒地区的综合调查工作。这三个地区是：穆棱河南北虎林地区、富锦以东直到乌苏里江的三角地带和嫩江以东讷谟尔河以北地区。调查人员在这共约二百六十万公顷面积上，作了初步调查。他们不仅初步了解了地形，记载了野生植物，并采集了土壤标本供分析研究该地土壤之用。由于这一系列工作，在上述三个地区了解到约有四十万公顷的荒地，不仅土质肥沃，而且地势良好，可立即开垦。另有荒地约九十万公顷，只要稍施排水工程，就可以利用。今年五月间即将派出正式勘测队，先在穆棱河、嫩江两地进行正规的周密勘测，为大规模开荒作好准备。
