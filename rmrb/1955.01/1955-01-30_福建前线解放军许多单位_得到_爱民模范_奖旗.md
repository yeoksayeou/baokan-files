Many units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Fujian Front received "Model of Cherishing the People" award banners from leading organs and silk banners from the local people around the Spring Festival.

    The Second Platoon of the Fifth Company of a certain unit was one of the units that received the "Model of Cherishing the People" award banner. Once, when a large number of residents were harvesting razor clams on the beach, they were shelled by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops on Kinmen Island. The Second Platoon's soldiers braved the artillery fire to guide the masses to evacuate and take cover, and rescued the wounded, reducing casualties among the people. Afterwards, the soldiers collectively donated money to help the affected people and organized a temporary farming team to help them with production.

    A unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed on Wuyu Island received a silk banner from the people of the island inscribed with the words "Defending the Country and Cherishing the People" on the eve of the Spring Festival. The officers and soldiers of this unit often economize on food and clothing to help the poor people on the island. Since the autumn of last year, the island has suffered from drought. In addition to actively assisting the masses in fighting the drought, the officers and soldiers of this unit also launched a campaign to save one or two liang of rice per person per day to help the farmers on the island who suffered from crop failures due to the disaster.

    In the frontline villages of Xiamen Island, which are often threatened by bombing and shelling by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit planes, the garrison vigorously helps residents build air-raid and artillery shelters. The command of a certain unit also sent a group of experienced staff officers to assist the government in conducting air defense and artillery defense education for the residents, and organized more than 30 drills, which greatly enhanced the residents' confidence in winning against air raids and artillery shelling. During the Spring Festival, this unit also received a silk banner from the local people. (Xinhua News Agency)

    福建前线解放军许多单位
    得到“爱民模范”奖旗
    福建前线中国人民解放军各部队有许多单位，在春节前后得到了领导机关颁给的“爱民模范”奖旗和驻地人民赠送的锦旗。
    某部五连二排，是得到“爱民模范”奖旗的单位之一。有一次驻地大批居民正在海滩上进行捞蟶生产时，遭到金门岛上蒋贼军开炮轰击。二排战士们冒着炮火参加指导群众疏散隐蔽，并抢救负伤的群众，减少了群众的伤亡。事后，战士们又集体捐款救济受难人民，组织临时代耕队帮助受难人民生产。
    驻守浯屿岛的人民解放军某部，在春节前夕接受了岛上人民赠给的一面写着“卫国爱民”字样的锦旗。这个部队的干部和战士们经常节衣缩食救济岛上贫苦人民。去年秋天以来岛上遭受旱灾，这个部队的干部、战士除积极协助群众抗旱外，又开展了每人每日节约一两米运动，救济因受灾失收的岛上农民。
    在经常受到蒋贼飞机轰炸和炮击威胁的厦门岛前哨村庄，驻军大力帮助居民构筑防空、防炮洞壕。某部指挥机关并派出一批有经验的参谋军官，协助政府对居民进行防空、防炮教育，并组织演习三十多次，大大增强了居民反空袭、反炮击的胜利信心。春节中，这个部队也得到了当地人民赠送的锦旗。　（新华社）
