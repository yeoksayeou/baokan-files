    An Outstanding School
    ——A Visit to the Beijing First Toy Production Cooperative
    By our reporter Shen Wenying
    One sunny winter afternoon.太平街(Taiping Street) Hutong seemed so quiet that one could clearly hear the sounds of electric saws, electric files, and wood planing coming from a residence. This was the Beijing First Toy Production Cooperative, which I had wanted to visit for a long time and which served children; the members of this cooperative were all young deaf-mutes.
    As soon as I entered, several comrades who were working came to greet me. The young female director, Zhang Fuhui, shook my hand warmly and led me to visit the workshop. The workshop was filled with various colorful small bulldozers, swing sets, climbing frames, small slides, rocking horses, small "nail-nail beds," pressure boards, and sandboxes, as well as rows of children's tables, chairs, small stools, and small beds. Various electric tools, such as electric saws, electric files, wood drilling machines, and electric rollers, were also installed here. Several male members skillfully operated the machines; young female members were polishing and painting the toys. They exchanged opinions on production operations by using sign language. This made me feel that this was not an ordinary handicraft workshop, but a semi-mechanized workshop.
    After the visit, Zhang Fuhui received me in the office and we began to communicate in writing. She first introduced the basic situation of the cooperative to me. Currently, there are thirty-nine members and twelve technicians in the cooperative; there are six electric machines and more than three hundred large and small tools. They can produce more than fifty kinds of children's toys, with a monthly output value of 50 million yuan. The products are sold as far away as Hailar City in Inner Mongolia, Datong in Shanxi, and Tieling in Liaoning.
    I curiously asked her: How did the cooperative develop? She answered this question. The cooperative was established in July 1952 and was named "Peace Toy Cooperative." The initiators were nine graduates from the school for the deaf and mute. They pooled 100,000 yuan, bought some wood, paint, nails, sandpaper, and a saw. At that time, only two people understood the technology, and they could make some small toys such as ducklings, jumping dogs, and penguins. Due to poor technology, low output, and high costs, the products could not find a market, production came to a standstill, and the members' lives became difficult. When it got cold, many comrades did not have cotton clothes, and sometimes they could not even eat. Some comrades sold their beloved cameras and used all the money to buy food for the cooperative; they also took out old cotton clothes and cotton shoes to share with everyone. Some comrades brought household utensils to the cooperative for use. Chen Huizhi volunteered to be the cook to save expenses. At one point, the cooperative's food reserves were only enough to eat for four days, and everyone was very worried. Later, everyone decided: comrades whose families were in Beijing and had better financial conditions would temporarily eat at home, while those with poor family circumstances would still eat at the cooperative. Later, seven members (deaf-mutes) who painted lantern slides were also absorbed, and the cooperative's income was barely enough to maintain the members' lives. In the midst of extreme difficulties, the Xidan District Supply and Marketing Cooperative came to order one thousand "puppies," four hundred "penguins," and two hundred "ducklings." We had no funds, so the Municipal Cooperative Headquarters lent us wood and cash. However, due to the members' low skills, they wasted materials and the products did not meet the standards; they often could not deliver the goods on time.
    Zhang Fuhui pondered for a moment, then continued to write: Last October, a piece of good news came: The Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative approved us as the Beijing First Toy Production Cooperative. At that time, the comrades were very excited, but the sales channels for the products had not yet been opened, and production was still not normal.
    She smiled and looked at me, then told me: The Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative has provided us with assistance in many ways. It pointed out the direction of development for our production, requiring us to face nurseries and kindergartens. At that time, we could only make toys such as jumping dogs and kittens, and the customers for these toys were mostly ordinary citizens, and the demand was very small. The management department then guided us to manufacture small bulldozers, small code tables, small "nail-nail beds," large hollow building blocks, high jump frames, slides, climbing frames, and other large toys for nurseries in various places; later, they also suggested that we manufacture children's tables, chairs, stools, and other items. At the same time, they also frequently borrowed various design drawings from the state-owned New China Toy Factory and the First Children's Utensils Cooperative for our reference; or sent people to guide production, so that the quality of products continued to improve. We have also received great help in solving funding difficulties and opening up sales channels.
    Speaking of this, I suddenly found a stack of toy design drawings on the desk. These were the works of nineteen-year-old member Zu Xiping. He was still a child when he started working. After continuous learning and research, with the help of his partners, he designed many educational toy drawings. For example, the "Universal Building Blocks" he designed can be used to build locomotives, mobile cranes, mobile sewing machines, road rollers, airplanes, etc. He also designed the toy "Sunscreen Water Play Box." It has an umbrella made of floral cloth on top to shade the sun; below is a large wooden box that can hold water, and there are seats on the side of the box where children can sit barefoot and play in the water. Various tropical trees and animals are painted on the outside of the box, which can help children identify plants and animals and cultivate their love for nature. This type of toy is loved by children in nurseries everywhere. In order to conduct research, he usually collects pictures and drawings of toys from acquaintances, sometimes goes to second-hand bookstores to find pictorials, and sometimes visits toy exhibitions. He finally slowly learned the technology. Once, he designed and manufactured a grinding wheel to install the frame of the "jumping dog," which not only increased production but also increased the product qualification rate from 70% to 90%. In the past, his father was always worried about his future. Since he started working, his father no longer worries about his child's future and often says to him:
"If it weren't for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, where would disabled people find a way out."
    When it was time to get off work in the evening, the members shook hands with me cordially and told me about their respective life experiences through writing. Geng Jishun was originally an apprentice in an inlay workshop and has now become a lathe operator with good skills. He often studies quietly next to the sawing machine late at night; sometimes he goes to other factories to study machines. He also tried to convert the sawing machine into a woodturning machine, or use machine parts to modify production tools. They are so diligent and hardworking, fighting against the various difficulties caused by their physical conditions, and training themselves to become skilled technicians. They also told me that Liu Baoxiang used to be the deaf-mute person who suffered the most, and only wore a new cotton-padded coat after joining the cooperative last year. …
    In the evening, the members quietly sat in the workshop again—at this time, the workshop had been transformed into a classroom, and the teacher used sign language to give cultural lessons, teaching them to learn sentence construction. Every Wednesday evening, they also teach them to practice telling stories such as "A Real Man," "How Steel Was Tempered," "The Long March Story," and "Dedicate Everything to the Party" in sign language, so as to enhance their self-confidence and overcome their sense of inferiority. They also often have group lessons here to study the country's general task during the transition period, or study the Constitution, and conduct technical research. They have stipulated a meeting reporting system, hold regular discussions, formulate work plans, and at the same time, they frequently conduct summaries and inspections to make their work even better.
    This is a production cooperative, and it is also an outstanding school. When I left, the sky was already full of stars. With feelings of sympathy, love, and admiration, I bid farewell to the members.

    一座出色的学校
    ——访北京市第一玩具生产合作社
    本报记者　沈文英
    一个晴朗的冬天的下午。太平街胡同里显得那么寂静，可以清楚地听到从一所住宅里传出来的电锯声、电锉声和刨木的响声。这就是我很久就想访问的为孩子们服务的北京市第一玩具生产合作社；参加这个社的社员都是年轻的聋哑人。
    我一进门，几个正在工作的同志就来接待我。年轻的女主任张福慧，亲切地和我握了手，就带领我去工场参观。工场里放着各式彩色的小推土车、秋千架、攀登架、小滑梯、摇马、小钉钉床、压板和沙土箱，还整齐地放着一排排的儿童用的桌、椅、小凳和小床。这里还安装着各种电动工具，如电锯、电锉、钻木机和电滚子等等。几个男社员在熟练地操纵着机器；年轻的女社员们正在把玩具磨光、擦油漆。他们借打手语交换对生产操作的意见。这使我感到这不是一个普通的手工业工场，而是一个半机械化的车间。
    参观之后，张福慧就接待我到办公室里开始了笔谈。她首先向我介绍了合作社的基本情况。现在，社内有三十九个社员，十二个技工；有六台电力机器和三百多件大小工具。他们能生产五十多种儿童玩具，每月产值达五千万元。产品远销到内蒙古的海拉尔市、山西的大同、辽宁的铁岭等地。
    我好奇地问她：合作社是怎样发展起来的？她回答了这个问题。合作社成立于一九五二年七月，命名为“和平玩具社”。发起人是聋哑学校的九个毕业同学。他们凑集了资金十万元，买了些木料、油漆、钉子、砂纸和一把锯子。当时，懂得技术的只有两人，他们能做一些小鸭、跳狗、企鹅等小玩具。由于技术差、产量低、成本高，产品找不到销路，生产就停顿下来，社员的生活发生了困难。天冷了，很多同志没有棉衣，有时还吃不上饭。有的同志便把自己心爱的照相机卖了，把钱全部给社内买了食粮；还把旧棉衣、棉鞋等全拿来分给大家穿。有的同志把家中用具拿到社内用。陈惠智自愿当炊事员，节约开支。有一个时期，社中存粮只够吃四天，大家都很发愁，后来大伙决定：家在北京而经济情况较好的同志暂时回家吃饭，家境不好的仍在社里吃饭。以后又吸收了七个画幻灯片的社员（聋哑人），合作社的收入勉强能维持社员的生活。正在万分困难的情况下，西单区供销合作社来定制一千只“小狗”、四百只“企鹅”、二百只“鸭子”。我们没有资金，市合作总社就借给我们木料和现款。可是由于社员技术太低，既费材料，产品又不合规格；到期往往交不上货。
    张福慧沉思了一下，又继续写道：去年十月里，一个喜讯传来了：市供销合作社批准我们为北京市第一玩具生产合作社。那时，同志们情绪很高，可是产品的销路还没有打开，生产仍不正常。
    她微笑着对我看一看，接着又告诉我：市供销合作总社对我们的帮助是多方面的。它对我们的生产指出了发展方向，要求我们面向托儿所、保育院。那时我们只能做跳狗、小猫等玩具，而这些玩具的顾客又多是一般市民，需求量很小。经理部就指导我们为各地托儿所制造小推土车、小字码表、小钉钉床，大型空心积木、跳高架子、滑梯、攀登架等大型玩具；后来，又提出建议，要我们制造儿童用的桌、椅、凳子等。同时，还经常从地方国营新中国玩具工厂、第一儿童用具社借来各种设计图样给我们参考；或派人来指导生产，使产品质量不断提高。在解决资金困难和打开销路等方面，我们也得到很大的帮助。
      谈到这里，我忽然在办公桌上发现了一叠玩具的设计图样。这是十九岁的社员俎锡屏的作品。他参加工作时还是个孩子。他经过了不断的学习、钻研，在伙伴们的帮助下，设计了很多有教育意义的玩具的图样。如他设计的“万能积木”可以搭火车头、活动起重车、活动缝纫机、压路机、飞机等。他又设计了玩具“防晒玩水箱”。上面撑着一顶花布做成的伞，可以遮太阳；下面是只可以放水的大木箱，箱边有座位，孩子可以赤脚坐在上面玩水。箱子外边画着各种热带的树木和动物，它可以帮助孩子识别植物和动物，培养他们对自然的爱。这种玩具受到各地托儿所孩子的喜爱。为了进行研究，他平时经常从熟人处收集玩具的图片和图样，有时到旧书摊上去找画报，有时去参观玩具展览会。他终于慢慢地学会了技术。有一次，他设计制造了一个砂轮来安装“跳狗”的架子，这不仅提高了产量，并使产品合格率由百分之七十提高到百分之九十。过去，他父亲一直为他的前途耽心，自他参加工作后，父亲不再为孩子的未来发愁了，常对他说：
  “要不是共产党和毛主席，残废人哪能得到出路。”
    傍晚下班时，社员们和我亲切地握手，通过笔谈告诉我各自的生活经历。耿继舜原是镶嵌作铺的学徒，现在已成为具有良好技术的镟工。他经常在晚间人静时，独自在锯木机旁钻研；有时到别的工厂去研究机器。他还想办法把锯木机改装成镟木机，或利用机器零件改装成生产工具。他们就是这样勤劳、刻苦，和生理上引起的种种困难展开斗争，把自己锻炼成为熟练的技工。他们又告诉我，刘宝祥过去是受苦最深的聋哑人，去年入社后才穿上了新棉袄。……
    晚上，社员们又安静地坐在车间里——这时车间已改变成教室，教师用手语给讲文化课，教他们学习造句。每逢星期三晚上，还教他们练习用手语讲“真正的人”、“钢铁是怎样炼成的”、“长征故事”、“把一切献给党”等故事，使他们增强自信心，克服自卑感。他们还经常在这里上团课，学习国家在过渡时期的总任务，或学习宪法，进行技术研究。他们规定了会议汇报制度，定期讨论，制订工作计划，同时经常进行总结检查，使工作做得更好。
    这是一个生产合作社，也是一座出色的学校。当我离开的时候，天空中已满布了星星。我带着同情、喜爱和敬佩的心情，向社员们告别。
