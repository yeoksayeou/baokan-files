Nearly Eight Hundred Kilometers of New Railways Laid

Great achievements were made in new railway construction across the country in 1954. Last year, construction began on twelve railways, with construction sites spanning over three thousand kilometers. According to preliminary statistics, by the end of last year, 792 kilometers of new railways had been laid and opened to traffic, 37 kilometers more than originally planned. The entire year's track-laying plan was completed eleven days ahead of schedule.

The railway from Lanzhou in China, via Urumqi, to Alma-Ata in the Soviet Union, has already crossed the dangerous areas of Wushaoling and passed through the Gulang Gorge. It reached Huaixibao fifteen days ahead of schedule. Now it has laid an additional nineteen kilometers, crossing the Jiuba Station. The Jining-Erlian railway, part of the railway from Jining in China to Ulan Bator in Mongolia, completed the entire track-laying task fourteen days ahead of schedule. The girder erection project for the Bawanghe Bridge was completed on December 24th. Thus, the main line between Jining and Erlian is now fully open to engineering trains. The southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, the trunk line connecting southwest and northwest China, has passed through the perilous "Yanmen" mountain area in Sichuan, reaching Guangyuan three days ahead of schedule. On December 28th, it had crossed the Shangxiba Station by five kilometers. The northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway has reached a place eleven kilometers away from Baoji. The key project in the northern section, the Weihe River Bridge, has been completed, and the Qinling Tunnel project is being rushed. The pilot tunnel is about one-quarter completed. Construction of the middle section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway has also begun. The Yalin Line and the Tanglin Line, built in the dense forests of Northeast China, have been completed. The realignment project of the Kanglang section of the Beijing-Baotou Railway, in coordination with the construction of the Guanting Reservoir, has also been fully completed. The Hanshui Railway Bridge, a component of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge project connecting the Yuehan Railway and the Jinghan Railway, has been completed. The track-laying project for the Hankou and Hanyang connecting lines has also been completed. Now, trains can travel directly from Hankou Station to Hanyang Station via the Hanshui Railway Bridge.

    新建铁路铺轨近八百公里
   一九五四年全国新建铁路取得了很大成就。去年，有十二条铁路开工修建，施工地段长达三千多公里。据初步统计，到去年年底止，已铺轨通车的新铁路达七百九十二公里，比原订计划多铺三十七公里。去年全年铺轨计划提前十一天完成。
    由我国兰州经乌鲁木齐到苏联阿拉木图铁路，已经跨过乌鞘岭、穿过古浪峡等艰险地带，提前十五天铺轨到怀西堡，现在已多铺了十九公里，越过了九坝车站。由我国集宁到蒙古乌兰巴托铁路的集二线，已经提前十四天完成全线铺轨任务，坝王河大桥架梁工程已于十二月二十四日完工，至此，集宁、二连间正线已全部通行工程列车。连接我国西南、西北的干线宝成铁路南段工程，已经穿过四川天险“雁门”山区，提前三天铺轨到了广元，十二月二十八日，已越过上西坝车站五公里；宝成铁路北段铺轨工程已到达离宝鸡十一公里的地方；北段的重点工程——渭河大桥已经修完，秦岭隧道工程正在紧张赶修，导坑已完成约四分之一；宝成铁路中段工程亦已重点开工。在东北密林中修筑的牙林线和汤林线，已经修通。配合官厅水库建设的京包线康狼段改线工程，也已全线完成。连接粤汉铁路和京汉铁路的武汉长江大桥工程的组成部分——汉水铁桥已经建成，汉口和汉阳两联络线的铺轨工程也完成了。现在，火车可以从汉口车站通过汉水铁桥，直达汉阳车站。
