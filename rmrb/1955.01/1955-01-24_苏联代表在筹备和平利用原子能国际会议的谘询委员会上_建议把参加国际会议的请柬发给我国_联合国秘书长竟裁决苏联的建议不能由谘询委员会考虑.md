Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 23rd: According to TASS, the United Nations Consultative Committee for the Preparation of the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy adjourned after holding a regular meeting on the 21st. The United Nations Secretariat issued a communique after the meeting stating that the Soviet representative, Academician D.V. Skobeltsyn of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, proposed that when the United Nations Secretary-General distributes invitations to various countries to participate in the discussion on the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, the invitation to China should be sent to the government of the People's Republic of China.

It is quite obvious that the Soviet representative put forward this proposal in order to have representatives of all the world's people participate in the upcoming conference. If the great Chinese people, numbering six hundred million, do not participate in this conference, the prestige of the United Nations as an international organization responsible for promoting the development and strengthening of international cooperation will be undermined. It is clear that on such an important international conference as the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, the only entity that can represent the great China should be its legitimate government - the government of the People's Republic of China, and not the Kuomintang clique that has been driven out of China.

The communique stated that the United Nations Secretary-General, in his capacity as Chairman of the Consultative Committee, ruled that the Soviet representative's proposal could not be considered by the Consultative Committee because it exceeded the scope of the Consultative Committee's authority. The Soviet representative objected to the Secretary-General's ruling. However, the ruling was passed by a majority of the committee's representatives.

    苏联代表在筹备和平利用原子能国际会议的谘询委员会上
    建议把参加国际会议的请柬发给我国
    联合国秘书长竟裁决苏联的建议不能由谘询委员会考虑
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十二日讯：筹备和平利用原子能国际会议的联合国谘询委员会在二十一日举行例会后休会。联合国秘书处在会后发表公报说，苏联代表、苏联科学院院士德·维·斯科贝尔琴提议，联合国秘书长在分发请柬邀请各国参加讨论和平利用原子能国际会议时，应把对中国的请柬发给中华人民共和国政府。
    十分明显，苏联代表提出这一建议，是为了在即将举行的会议上有世界各国人民的代表参加。如果在这一会议上没有数达六亿的伟大的中国人民参加，那么联合国作为负有促进国际合作的发展和加强这一使命的国际组织的威信，就要受到破坏。很明显，在讨论和平利用原子能国际会议这样一种重要的国际性会议上，唯一能代表伟大中国的应该是它的合法政府——中华人民共和国政府，而不是已被逐出中国的国民党集团。
    公报中说，联合国秘书长以谘询委员会主席的身份裁决：苏联代表的建议不能由谘询委员会考虑，因为这一建议越出了谘询委员会的权限范围。苏联代表反对秘书长的这一裁决。但是这一裁决被委员会大多数代表通过。
