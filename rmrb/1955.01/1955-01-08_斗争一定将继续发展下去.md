The parliamentary delegations of Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic adopted a resolution on December 31, 1954, strongly condemning the organizers and promoters of the rearmament of West Germany for the shameful pressure they exerted to force Western European parliaments to ratify the Paris Agreements. The resolution also expressed active support for the heroic struggle being waged by the people of France, the people of Germany, and the people of other European countries against the revival of German militarism. The parliamentary delegations of the three countries further declared in the resolution the determination of the people of the three countries: should the Paris Agreements be ratified, the people of the three countries will fully and effectively support the governments of the three countries in taking all necessary measures to safeguard the independence of their countries, to safeguard the peaceful labor of their people, and to guarantee the inviolability of their borders and territories. This resolution of the parliamentary delegations of the three countries fully reflects the firm will of the peace-loving people of Europe and the world to oppose the revival of German militarism and safeguard European peace. The Chinese people express their firm support for this resolution.

The resolution of the parliamentary delegations of the three countries points out that the result of the French National Assembly's ratification of the Paris Agreements is by no means the end of the French people's struggle against the revival of German militarism. For more than four years, the French people and other patriotic forces in France have been engaged in a persistent and repeated struggle against the revival of German militarist forces. From the outset, the French people and other patriotic forces in France have correctly recognized that the revival of German militarism under any guise would be a fatal threat to the independence and security of France and would greatly increase the danger of a new war in Europe. In the struggle to safeguard the independence and security of their country and to strive for European peace, all patriotic forces in France have shown firm integrity and unity, and have received the deep sympathy and full support of peace-loving people all over the world. The great unity of the French people and other patriotic forces in France enabled the French National Assembly to reject the so-called "European Defense Community" treaty, which was planned and formulated by the United States, on August 30 of last year, and again, less than four months later, to initially reject the protocol on the rearmament of West Germany in the Paris Agreements on December 24. During the final days of the French National Assembly's debate, the French people and other patriotic forces in France held rallies across the country, and sent thousands of delegations to petition the French National Assembly, resolutely opposing the ratification of the Paris Agreements. At the same time, the struggle against the Paris Agreements in the French parliament was particularly tenacious. These facts clearly show that the French people's will to oppose the revival of German militarism is consistently firm and unwavering. The Paris Agreements, which were forced through the French National Assembly, do not have the support of the French people. The French people's struggle to defend peace and security is continuing, and will certainly continue to go on.

Many members of the French National Assembly correctly pointed out that the plan for the Paris Agreements to revive German militarism is Dulles' policy. This plan is clearly designed to serve the sinister purpose of American monopoly capitalists to throw Europe back into a terrible war disaster. In order to implement this criminal plan, the American aggressive bloc and their British partners not only used all kinds of intimidation against France before the debate in the French National Assembly, not only put forward false so-called "guarantees" to carry out deception, but also, after the French National Assembly once rejected the protocol on the rearmament of West Germany, Eisenhower and the British Foreign Office publicly issued statements to intimidate the French National Assembly and the French public. At the same time, they mobilized all their propaganda machines to clamor and force France to ratify the Paris Agreements. Even more despicable and shameless was that the American aggressive bloc and its accomplices in Britain also instructed the Vatican's representative in Paris and others to conduct behind-the-scenes activities, asking members of the French National Assembly to support the Paris Agreements. This practice by the United States and Britain is a prominent and egregious act of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries in recent international relations. It is the same as Hitler's intimidation of the heads of the British and French governments in Munich that year, and the dispatch of diplomatic personnel to London and Paris to lobby British and French politicians to sell out their national interests.

After the French National Assembly rejected the protocol on the rearmament of West Germany in the first vote, Mendès-France stepped up the pressure to force the French National Assembly to ratify the Paris Agreements, and used all means of intimidation, deception, and co-opting against some members of the French parliament. He even offered ministerial positions behind the scenes to buy off members of certain groups. Even so, the French government could only force less than half of the members of the National Assembly to vote in favor of the Paris Agreements. Anyone can see that the Paris Agreements seriously endanger French interests. Mendès-France himself admitted that "the rearmament of West Germany is undoubtedly painful" for the French, but he threatened the members of parliament with the claim that the United States and Britain might arm West Germany separately regardless of France, and that rejecting the Paris Agreements would cause France to lose its international standing. This claim is obviously unfounded. As a major power in Europe, France should, of course, make its own independent decisions on issues that are of great importance to its own vital interests, and should not be intimidated by the threatening cries of the American aggressive bloc.

The French National Assembly was forced to approve the Paris Agreements by a very narrow majority. Now that this agreement has not yet been reviewed by the French Senate and has not completed its ratification process, the American aggressive bloc's demands for the revival of German militarism are already impatiently evident. Recently, American officials have been openly clamoring that the United States has prepared a large number of military equipment, including tanks, aircraft, artillery, and electronic devices, which will soon be handed over to the West German "Defense Force" that will be allowed to rearm. West German revanchist newspapers have also been increasingly making open demands for the French territories of Alsace and Lorraine. These facts clearly show that once German militarism is revived, it will pose a direct threat to the security of the people of European countries, first and foremost to France. The result of the French authorities' obedience to the will of the United States in accepting the Paris Agreements is that France has lost the true and reliable force to guarantee French security—the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty—and is isolated and helpless in the face of the aggressive threat of German militarist forces. The re-establishment of German revanchist forces not only creates new and greater obstacles to the resolution of the German question, to the restoration of German unification, and to making Germany a peace-loving and democratic country, but also turns West Germany into a hotbed of new war in Europe.

The American aggressive bloc is trying to revive German militarist forces to create war and division in Europe. However, the people of France and Germany, and the people of Western European countries, will never allow this aggressive plan to be implemented smoothly. These days, the French people, in response to the call of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, are continuing to strengthen their struggle against the arming of West Germany. The people of Germany, Britain, Italy, Denmark, Belgium, and other countries have also launched struggles against the arming of West Germany. The youth of Bremerhaven, West Germany, held a demonstration in the rain, chanting "We don't want to be mercenaries!" "We don't want American weapons, we want peace!" This is a vivid example.

Similarly, the American war plan to revive German militarism will not catch peace-loving countries off guard. The joint declaration of the eight governments issued at the European countries' conference in Moscow clearly stated: "They are determined to take joint measures in organizing armed forces and command headquarters in the event that the Paris Agreements are ratified, and to take other measures necessary to strengthen their national defense forces to ensure the peaceful labor of their people, to guarantee the inviolability of their borders, and to guarantee the repulse of possible aggression." The resolution of the parliamentary delegations of Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Germany also warned the people of European countries to be vigilant against the danger of the revival of West German aggressive forces, and stated that the three countries, like all countries in the peace camp, will never sit idly by and watch German militarism revive and become a weapon for renewed aggression. We, the Chinese people, deeply know that world peace is indivisible. We fully support the joint declaration of the eight governments of the Moscow Conference and the resolution of the parliamentary delegations of Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Germany, and will fully support all measures taken by these peace-loving countries.

Peace-loving countries and people believe in their own strength. Now, the strength of the peace and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is unprecedentedly strong and unprecedentedly united. The strength and unity of the peace-loving people of the world are growing stronger and more consolidated. Any attempt to launch a war and undermine the peaceful lives of the people of all countries will be met with a devastating blow.

Although the French National Assembly reluctantly approved the Paris Agreements by a slight majority, the struggle of the peace-loving people of all countries and the French people against the Paris Agreements, against the revival of German militarism, and against the conspiracy of a new war will certainly continue to rise. Those who attempt to use the ratification of the Paris Agreements to prepare for a new war in Europe will continue to be met with more resolute opposition from the French people, the German people, and the people of other Western European countries, and will be met with new blows. This just struggle of the French people, the German people, and the peace-loving people of European countries will receive the consistent sympathy and support of the peace-loving people of the world.

    斗争一定将继续发展下去
    高集
    波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国三国议会代表会议在一九五四年十二月三十一日通过决议，严厉地谴责了重新武装西德的组织者和推动者为了迫使西欧国家议会批准巴黎协定所施行的可耻压力。决议并表示积极支持法国人民、德国人民和欧洲其他各国人民为反对复活德国军国主义而继续进行的英勇的斗争。三国议会代表会议在决议中更宣布三国人民的决心：在巴黎协定一旦批准的情况下，三国人民一定完全和有效地支持三国政府为保障自己国家的独立、为保障自己人民的和平劳动和自己边境和领土的不可侵犯性而采取的一切必要措施。三国议会代表会议的这个决议，充分反映了欧洲和世界爱好和平人民反对复活德国军国主义和保障欧洲和平的坚定意志。中国人民对这个决议表示坚决的支持。
    三国议会代表会议的决议中指出，法国国民议会批准巴黎协定的结果，绝不是法国人民反对复活德国军国主义斗争的终止。四年多以来，法国人民和法国其他爱国力量为反对复活德国军国主义势力，一直进行了坚持不懈的反复斗争。法国人民和法国其他爱国力量自始就正确地认识到，不论在任何幌子下复活德国军国主义，都会是对法国的独立和安全的致命威胁，都会大大增加在欧洲发生一次新战争的危险。法国的一切爱国力量在维护自己国家的独立和安全、争取欧洲和平的斗争中，表现了坚强不屈和团结一致，并得到全世界爱好和平人民的深切同情和全力支持。法国人民和法国其他爱国力量的伟大团结，曾使法国国民议会于去年八月三十日拒绝了美国策划制订的所谓“欧洲防务集团”条约，并在不到四个月之后，又使法国国民议会在十二月二十四日一度否决了巴黎协定关于重新武装西德的议定书。在法国国民议会最后几天的辩论过程中，法国人民和法国其他爱国的力量在全国各地风起云涌地举行集会，并派出了数以千计的代表团到法国国民议会请愿，坚决反对批准巴黎协定。同时，法国议会反对巴黎协定的斗争也特别顽强。这些事实清楚地表明了，法国人民反对复活德国军国主义的意志是始终坚定不移的。在法国国民议会中被强迫通过的巴黎协定，是得不到法国人民的支持的。法国人民保卫和平和安全的斗争正在继续，并且一定会继续进行下去。
    法国国民议会的许多议员正确指出，巴黎协定复活德国军国主义的计划是杜勒斯的政策。这种计划明显地是为美国垄断资本家重新把欧洲投入一次可怕的战争灾难的阴险目的服务的。美国侵略集团和他们的英国伙伴为了推行这个罪恶的计划，不但曾在法国国民议会辩论之前百般地对法国进行威吓，不但曾提出虚伪的所谓“保证”以实行诱骗，并且在法国国民议会一度否决了重新武装西德的议定书之后，艾森豪威尔和英国的外交部更公开发表声明向法国国民议会和法国公众施行恫吓，同时还动员了他们所有的宣传机器大肆叫嚷，逼迫法国批准巴黎协定。更卑鄙无耻的是，美国侵略集团和它在英国的帮手们还曾指使梵蒂冈驻巴黎的代表等进行幕后活动，要法国国民议会议员支持巴黎协定。美、英的这种做法，是近年国际关系中突出的干涉别国内部事务的恶劣行为。这和希特勒当年在慕尼黑恫吓英、法两国政府首脑，并派遣外交人员在伦敦和巴黎运动英、法政界人物出卖他们国家利益的做法是一样的。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯在法国国民议会第一次投票拒绝重新武装西德的议定书后，加紧逼迫要法国国民议会批准巴黎协定，并对法国一部分议员使尽了恐吓、欺骗、笼络的手段，甚至在幕后提出以部长职位来收买某些集团的议员。即使这样，法国政府也只能迫使不到一半的国民议会议员投票赞成巴黎协定。谁也能看出，巴黎协定是严重地危害法国利益的。孟戴斯—弗朗斯自己也承认，对法国人来说“重新武装西德无疑是痛苦的”，但是他以美国和英国可能不顾法国而单独武装西德、拒绝巴黎协定就会使法国丧失其国际地位等等说法威胁议员，这种说法显然是毫无根据的。法国作为一个欧洲的大国，当然应该在对于和自己切身利害有重大关系的问题上作出自己独立的决定，而不应为美国侵略集团的威胁叫嚷所吓倒。
    法国国民议会被迫在一个极微弱的多数之下批准了巴黎协定。现在这个协定还未经法国参议院审议，还未完成它的批准程序，而美国侵略集团复活德国军国主义的要求就已经显得迫不及待了。最近以来，美国的官员们已在公开地喧嚷说，美国已准备了包括坦克、飞机、大炮和电子装置的大批军事装备，即将交给将被容许重新武装的西德“国防军”。西德复仇主义的报纸，也已愈来愈经常地提出对法国领土阿尔萨斯和洛林两地的公开要求了。这种事实清楚地说明了，德国军国主义一旦复活起来，就一定会造成对欧洲各国人民的安全的直接威胁，首先是对法国的威胁。法国的当政者顺从美国的意旨接受巴黎协定的结果，同时就使法国失去了保障法国安全的真正的可靠力量——法苏互助同盟条约，而在德国军国主义势力侵略威胁的面前，陷于孤立无援的地位。德国复仇主义者的军队的重新建立，不但为德国问题的解决、为德国统一的恢复、为使德国成为一个爱好和平的民主国家造成新的、更大的障碍，而且会使西德变成欧洲新战争的策源地。
    美国侵略集团力图复活德国军国主义势力，来在欧洲制造战争和分裂。但是，法、德两国人民和西欧各国人民是绝不会容许这个侵略计划顺利实施的。这几天来，法国人民响应法国共产党中央的号召，正在继续加强反对武装西德的斗争。德国、英国、意大利、丹麦、比利时等国的人民，也开展了反对武装西德的斗争。西德不来梅港的青年们在暴风雨中举行示威游行，高呼“我们不愿当雇佣兵！”“我们不要美国武器，我们要和平！”就是一个生动的例子。
    同样，美国复活德国军国主义的战争计划，也是不会使爱好和平的国家措手不及的。在莫斯科举行的欧洲国家会议所发表的八国政府联合宣言，曾明确地宣布：“它们具有决心在巴黎协定竟然批准时在组织武装力量和司令部方面采取共同措施，并且还要采取加强它们国防力量所必需的其他措施，以保障它们人民的和平劳动，保证它们国境的不可侵犯性，保证击退可能发生的侵略。”波、捷、德三国议会代表会议的决议也向欧洲各国人民发出提防西德侵略势力复活危险的警告，并表示三国同和平阵营中的一切国家一样，决不会坐视德国军国主义恢复起来，成为重新侵略的武器。我们中国人民深深地知道，世界的和平是不可分割的。我们完全拥护莫斯科会议八国政府的联合宣言和波、捷、德三国议会代表会议的决议，并将全力支持这些爱好和平国家所采取的一切措施。
    爱好和平的国家和人民是相信自己的力量的。现在，以苏联为首的和平和社会主义阵营力量已空前的强大，空前的团结一致。世界爱好和平的人民的力量和团结，正在日益加强和巩固。任何企图发动战争和破坏各国人民和平生活的图谋，都将遭到毁灭性的打击。
    虽然法国国民议会以微弱的多数勉强批准了巴黎协定，但是各国爱好和平人民和法国人民反对巴黎协定、反对复活德国军国主义、反对新战争阴谋的斗争必将继续高涨。那些企图借助于巴黎协定的批准来在欧洲准备新战争的人们，将会不断遭受到法国人民、德国人民和西欧其他各国人民更加坚决的反对，并将遭受到新的打击。法国人民、德国人民和欧洲各国爱好和平的人民的这种正义斗争将获得全世界爱好和平人民的始终如一的同情和支持。
