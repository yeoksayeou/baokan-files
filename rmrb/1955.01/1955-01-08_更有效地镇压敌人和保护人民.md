The "Regulations on Arrest and Detention of the People's Republic of China" are formulated in accordance with our country's Constitution. Its basic spirit is to implement ruthless suppression of the people's enemies, while resolutely protecting the personal freedom and democratic rights of all law-abiding citizens. The implementation of these regulations will further strengthen and improve our country's revolutionary legal system, consolidate our people's democratic dictatorship, and ensure the smooth progress of the country's socialist construction.

Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us long ago in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "We definitely do not exercise benevolence towards the reactionary acts of reactionaries and reactionary classes." In the past few years, we have resolutely implemented this instruction, carried out a vigorous anti-revolutionary movement throughout the country, and punished various criminals according to law, rapidly consolidating revolutionary order and social security, and ensuring the recovery of the national economy.

During the period of planned socialist construction, domestic class struggle has become more acute and complex. Those anti-revolutionary elements who escaped the net and enemy agents newly dispatched are intensifying their sabotage activities with more insidious methods. This situation requires us to continuously strengthen the suppression of enemies and further tighten the state's legal system so that we can more effectively combat enemy sabotage activities, in order to more effectively protect the country's construction cause and safeguard the people's lives, property, democratic rights, and personal freedom.

To adapt to this situation and these requirements, the "Regulations on Arrest and Detention of the People's Republic of China" concentrates the experience of suppressing anti-revolutionary activities and protecting the people's democratic rights over the years, and solidifies these experiences in the form of legislation, so that state organs have a unified basis when arresting and detaining criminals, and the people can better supervise and support the actions of state organs in this regard. This is of great benefit to consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship and ensuring the cause of socialist construction. The purpose of all the provisions of this regulation is to more effectively protect the interests of the country, maintain public order, and safeguard the democratic rights of citizens. Failure to stipulate this would inevitably indulge enemies and criminals, depriving the state and people of security.

Should a person who is preparing to commit a crime be arrested or detained before their crime has achieved its purpose? Should their person, belongings, and those of related persons be searched? Should their mail and telegrams be detained when necessary? This is absolutely necessary. Does this violate personal freedom and the people's democratic rights? Of course not. If someone believes that arresting and detaining those who are preparing to commit crimes is a violation of human rights, this understanding is completely wrong and extremely harmful. Because according to these people's ideas, we would not be able to take any action against those anti-revolutionary elements or other bad elements who are preparing to commit crimes, but could only allow them to calmly realize their criminal intentions and harm the interests of the country and the people. Is this what the state's laws and the broad masses of the people can tolerate? In 1951, the Military Law Department of the Beijing Military Control Commission sentenced an American spy, Li An-dong, and others for attempting to bombard Tiananmen Square on National Day. The public security organs arrested them before they even took action. If the public security organs had not arrested them and conducted searches before their crime had achieved its purpose, the enemy's evil plan would have been successfully realized, and the leaders of our party and state and the masses participating in the parade would have been harmed. This is, of course, not permissible. It should be understood that we guarantee personal freedom only to all law-abiding citizens, and absolutely not to anti-revolutionary elements and other bad elements. American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique very much hope to find that kind of freedom to commit crimes in our country, but the Chinese people are not fools, and will not give any freedom to anti-revolutionary elements. Those who have already committed crimes will naturally be arrested and severely punished, and those who are preparing to commit crimes will also be dealt with appropriately.

It is entirely necessary for public security organs to directly conduct searches or detain criminals in emergency situations without the approval of the People's Procuratorate. If someone also believes that this is a violation of personal freedom and the people's democratic rights, this understanding is also completely wrong and extremely harmful. For example, if an arson or explosion case suddenly occurs somewhere, if the public security personnel who arrive at the scene in time do not immediately take emergency measures, order that people and items within a certain range are temporarily not allowed to move, conduct necessary inquiries and searches, and temporarily detain the most suspected person, then it is very likely that the criminals will escape, or the changes to the scene will increase the difficulty of solving the case. Therefore, under these extremely rare special circumstances, although the actions of some people may be temporarily restricted, it should not be considered a violation of personal freedom and the people's democratic rights. Because these emergency measures are for the protection of the interests of the country and the protection of the people's lives and property.

In our country, the personal freedom and democratic rights of any law-abiding citizen are absolutely not allowed to be violated. This is a firm and unwavering principle. Our Party has repeatedly taught public security and judicial personnel that they must carry out their work in the spirit of seeking truth from facts and being conscientious and responsible, neither letting go of an enemy of the people, nor allowing a good person to be wronged. The people's public security and judicial organs have done so. In the past few years, when arresting or detaining criminals, they have generally relied on the masses to conduct careful investigations in advance, found conclusive evidence of the crime, or discovered major criminal suspicions, and after going through certain approval procedures, they have arrested and detained those criminals who should be arrested and detained. If it was discovered afterward that there were improper arrests, they were corrected. The "Regulations on Arrest and Detention of the People's Republic of China" summarizes the work experience of previous years and makes more detailed provisions on the scope of arrest and detention of criminals, the organs responsible for executing arrests and detentions and their powers, and other related matters. This regulation implements the spirit of a strict revolutionary legal system, stipulating that the arrest and detention of criminals must be handled in accordance with strict legal provisions: the power to decide on arrest and approve the arrest of criminals belongs to the People's Courts and the People's Procuratorates. When public security organs request the arrest of criminals, they must first obtain approval from the People's Procuratorate. After the public security organs detain a criminal in an emergency, they should also notify the People's Procuratorate of the facts and reasons for the detention within twenty-four hours of the detention. The People's Procuratorate should approve or disapprove the arrest within forty-eight hours of receiving the notice. The public security organs should immediately release those whose arrest is not approved. Various legal procedures that must be followed are also stipulated for the organs executing the arrest and detention when arresting criminals, searching for evidence, and interrogating after arrest and detention.

These provisions on the one hand show that: except for the People's Courts, the People's Procuratorates, and the public security organs, no other organs or individuals have the right to arrest or detain criminals; whoever does not abide by this provision and privately arrests or detains criminals is committing an illegal act that violates personal freedom. On the other hand, it also shows that: even the public security and judicial organs must abide by strict regulations and cannot arbitrarily arrest and detain people in violation of legal provisions. In order to ensure that these provisions are strictly followed, the regulations also specifically stipulate that: whenever there is an illegal arrest or detention of citizens, the People's Procuratorate should investigate; if this illegal act is out of frame-up, retaliation, embezzlement or other personal motives, criminal responsibility should also be pursued. This provision is very important, it guarantees that no organ or individual can abuse their power, violate laws and discipline, and thus can effectively prevent wrongful arrests and detentions, and can correct them in time if such illegal acts occur.

In order to implement these regulations, the People's Courts, the People's Procuratorates, and the People's Public Security organs must greatly strengthen legal education for their staff, so that everyone deeply understands that the purpose of strengthening the revolutionary legal system is to more effectively suppress the enemy and protect the people, so that everyone has a complete understanding of these two aspects, and cannot infringe upon the people because of strengthening the suppression of the enemy, nor can they indulge the enemy because of strengthening the protection of the people. Regular arrest and detention procedures and the power to implement emergency measures when necessary are both necessary to achieve this unified goal. If someone rashly implements arrest and detention because they have the power to take emergency measures, that is completely unacceptable, and those with serious circumstances should also be held criminally responsible. Because this will infringe upon the democratic rights and personal freedom of the people, create unjust cases, and affect the relationship between state organs and the people. However, on the other hand, if someone thinks that the legal procedures stipulated in this regulation only increase trouble, and thus develop a negative attitude, and do not arrest and interrogate criminals who should be arrested and interrogated because they are afraid of trouble, so that they indulge the enemy, indulge the anti-revolutionary elements and criminals, this is equally absolutely unacceptable. Because this would equally put the interests of the country and the lives and property of the people in a position of no guarantee. Although it is difficult for us to guarantee that there will be absolutely no errors in our specific work, if we can deeply criticize and overcome the above-mentioned possible erroneous thoughts, we can guarantee that errors will be avoided.

Party and government leading organs at all levels, especially the public security and judicial organs, should also, in conjunction with their daily work, conduct extensive publicity among the people, explaining the various provisions in this regulation and the benefits of these provisions to the country and the people, mobilizing the people to supervise the correct implementation of this regulation by state organs, and give state organs support and assistance, actively reporting anti-revolutionary elements and criminals, and helping the public security and judicial organs to capture various criminals.

### 更有效地镇压敌人和保护人民

    更有效地镇压敌人和保护人民
    “中华人民共和国逮捕拘留条例”是根据我国宪法制订的，它的基本精神是对人民的敌人实行无情的镇压，而对于一切守法公民则坚决保护他们的人身自由和民主权利。这个条例的贯彻实施，将进一步加强和健全我国的革命法制，巩固我国的人民民主专政，保障国家社会主义建设的顺利进行。
    毛泽东同志在“论人民民主专政”中早就指示我们：“我们对于反动派和反动阶级的反动行为，决不施仁政。”过去的几年中间，我们坚决执行了这个指示，在全国范围内进行了大张旗鼓的镇压反革命运动，并且依法惩办了各种犯罪分子，迅速地巩固了革命的秩序和社会的治安，保障了国民经济的恢复工作。
    在有计划的社会主义建设的时期，国内的阶级斗争更加尖锐和复杂了，那些逃亡漏网的反革命分子和敌人新派遣来的特务分子，正在用更加诡秘的方法加紧进行破坏活动。这种形势要求我们不断地加强对于敌人的镇压，更加严密国家的法律制度，使我们能够更有效地打击敌人的破坏活动，以便更有效地保障国家的建设事业，保障人民的生命财产、民主权利和人身自由。
    适应这种形势和要求，“中华人民共和国逮捕拘留条例”集中了历年来镇压反革命活动和保障人民民主权利的经验，用立法的形式把这些经验固定下来，使国家机关在逮捕拘留人犯时有了统一的依据，也使人民群众能够更好地监督和支持国家机关在这一方面的行动，这对于巩固人民民主专政和保障社会主义建设事业都有很大的好处。这个条例的各项规定的目的都是为了更有效地保护国家的利益，维护公共秩序，保障公民的民主权利。不这样规定，就必然会放纵了敌人和违法犯罪分子，使国家和人民的安全失掉保障。
    对于一个正在预备犯罪的人，在他的犯罪还未达到目的的时候，是不是也应该把他逮捕或拘留起来呢？对他及有关人的人身、物品等是不是也应该进行搜查呢？在必要时是不是还应该扣押他的邮件和电报呢？这是完全应该的。这样是不是侵犯了人身自由和人民的民主权利呢？当然不是。如果有人认为逮捕和拘留了那些正在预备犯罪的分子就是侵犯了人权，这种认识是完全错误的，是极其有害的。因为依照这些人的想法，我们就不可能对那些正在预备犯罪的反革命分子或其他坏分子采取什么行动，而只能听任他们从容地实现犯罪企图，听任他们危害国家和人民的利益。这难道是国家的法律和广大人民能够容许的吗？一九五一年北京市军事管制委员会军法处曾经判决了一件美国间谍李安东等企图在国庆节炮轰天安门的案件，公安机关是在他们还未动手以前就把他们逮捕了的。如果公安机关不在他们犯罪还未达到目的以前及早逮捕了他们和进行搜查，结果就会使敌人的罪恶计划顺利实现，我们党和国家的领导人员和参加游行的群众就会受到伤害。这当然是不能容许的。应该了解：我们保障人身自由只是保障全体守法公民的人身自由，绝对不保障反革命分子和其他坏分子的人身自由。美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团是很希望在我们的国家里找到那种保障犯法的自由的，但是中国人民不是傻瓜，对于反革命分子不会给予任何自由的，对于已经犯罪的，自然要抓起来严办，对于正在预备犯罪的，也要加以适当处理。
    公安机关在紧急情况下不经人民检察院批准而直接进行搜查或拘留人犯，这是完全必要的。如果有人也认为这是侵犯人身自由和人民的民主权利，这种认识也是完全错误的，也是极其有害的。譬如说某处突然发生了一件纵火或爆破的案件，及时赶到现场的公安人员如果不立即采取紧急措施，命令一定范围内的人和物品暂时不许移动，同时进行必要的讯问和搜查，并把嫌疑最大的人临时拘留起来，那就很有可能让犯罪分子跑掉，或者由于现场的变动而增加了破案的困难。因此在这种极少的特殊情况之下，虽然有一些人的行动会暂时受到限制，也不应该认为是侵犯了人身自由和人民的民主权利。因为这种紧急措施是为了保护国家的利益，保护人民的生命财产。
    在我们的国家里，任何守法公民的人身自由和民主权利是决不容许侵犯的，这是一条坚定不移的原则。我们的党曾经一再地教导公安、司法人员，必须本着实事求是和认真负责的精神来进行工作，既不要放纵了一个人民的敌人，也不容许冤枉一个好人。人民公安、司法机关是这样作了的。几年来，他们在逮捕或拘留人犯的时候，一般都在事前依靠群众进行了认真的调查，找到了犯罪的确切证据，或者是发现了重大的犯罪嫌疑，经过一定的批准手续以后，才把那些应该逮捕、拘留的人犯逮捕、拘留起来；如果在事后发现有逮捕不当的情况，也都作了纠正。“中华人民共和国逮捕拘留条例”总结了历年来的工作经验，对于逮捕拘留人犯的范围、执行逮捕拘留的机关及其权限和其他有关事项，都作了更加周密的规定。这个条例贯彻了严格的革命法制的精神，规定逮捕、拘留人犯必须按照严格的法律规定办事：决定逮捕和批准逮捕人犯的权力属于人民法院和人民检察院，公安机关要求逮捕人犯的时候，必须事前经过人民检察院批准。公安机关在紧急情况下拘留人犯以后，也应当在拘留后的二十四小时以内把拘留的事实和理由通知人民检察院，人民检察院应当在接到通知后的四十八小时内批准逮捕或者不批准逮捕，公安机关对于不批准逮捕的应当立即释放；对于执行逮捕、拘留的机关在逮捕人犯、搜查罪证以及逮捕、拘留后的讯问等，也都规定了各种必须遵守的法律手续。
    这些规定一方面说明：除了人民法院、人民检察院和公安机关以外，任何机关或任何人都没有权逮捕、拘留人犯；谁如果不遵守这个规定，私自逮捕或拘留人犯，就是一种侵犯人身自由的违法行为。另一方面又说明：即使是公安、司法机关，也要遵照严格的规定办事，不能违反法律规定随意捕人押人。为了保证这些规定能被严格遵行，条例又特别规定：凡是发生了违法逮捕、拘留公民的现象，就应当由人民检察院进行查究；如果这种违法行为是出于陷害、报复、贪赃或其他个人的目的，还应当追究刑事责任。这个规定是很重要的，它保证任何机关和任何人都不得滥用职权，违法乱纪，因而能够有效地防止错捕、错押，并且在万一发生这种违法行为以后能够及时纠正。
    为了贯彻执行这个条例，人民法院、人民检察院和人民公安机关必须大大加强对于自己的工作人员的法制教育，使大家深刻认识加强革命法制的目的是要更有效地镇压敌人，保护人民，使大家对这两个方面有一个完整的理解，不能因加强镇压敌人而侵犯了人民，也不能因加强保护人民而放纵了敌人。正规的逮捕拘留手续同必要时实行紧急措置的权力，都是为了达到这个统一的目的所必需的，如果有的人因为握有采取紧急措置的权力而草率地实行逮捕拘留，那是完全不能允许的，情节严重的还要追究刑事责任。因为这会侵犯了人民的民主权利和人身自由，造成冤案，影响国家机关同人民群众的关系。但是另一方面，如果有人以为这个条例中所规定的法律手续只是增加了麻烦，因而产生一种消极的情绪，对应该逮捕审讯的罪犯也因害怕麻烦而不加逮捕审讯，以致放纵了敌人，放纵了反革命分子和违法犯罪分子，这同样是绝对不能容许的。因为这同样会使国家的利益和人民的生命财产置于毫无保障的地位。我们在具体工作中虽然很难保证绝对不发生一丝错误，但是如果能够深刻地批判和克服上述可能发生的错误思想，就能够保证避免错误的发生。
    各级党政领导机关、特别是公安、司法机关，还应该结合日常工作，向人民群众进行广泛的宣传，说明这个条例中的各项规定以及这些规定对国家和人民的好处，动员人民群众监督国家机关正确执行这个条例，并且给予国家机关以支持和协助，积极检举反革命分子和违法犯罪分子，帮助公安、司法机关捉拿各种罪犯。
