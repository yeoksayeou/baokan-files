Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 1st. Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, sent a telegram to all officers and men of the Korean People's Army on January 1st, congratulating them on the New Year.

The congratulatory telegram stated: "1954 was a year of great achievements and victories for the Korean people in their struggle to strengthen the revolutionary democratic base of the fatherland, restore and develop the post-war people's economy, and realize the peaceful reunification and independence of the fatherland. The armed forces of the Korean people – the People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers – have strictly abided by the Armistice Agreement and defended the peaceful and creative labor achievements of the people like a wall of iron."

The congratulatory telegram stated: "The U.S. imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique are uneasy seeing the growing strength of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in all aspects. Recently, they have attempted to obliterate a series of legitimate proposals by the government of the Republic to promote the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, and have engaged in heinous war incitement." The congratulatory telegram emphasized that if the U.S. imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique disregard the legitimate demands of the Korean people and re-launch adventurous actions against the Korean people, they will certainly be subjected to a decisive blow by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers.

The congratulatory telegram concluded by urging all officers and men of the People's Army to vigilantly monitor the activities of the U.S. imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique, and to defend the great creative labor achievements and democratic base of their parents and siblings with the strength of iron.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 1st. Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, sent a telegram to all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers on January 1, 1955, congratulating them on the New Year.

The congratulatory telegram stated: "In the past year, the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers have continued to establish glorious merits in the front and rear of the northern half of Korea. The Chinese People's Volunteers, together with the Korean People's Army, have consolidated the Korean Armistice, vigilantly guarded the creative labor achievements of the Korean people, and provided great assistance to Korea's post-war people's economic recovery and construction. This selfless struggle and friendly assistance has further strengthened the Korean people's confidence in victory in the cause of peaceful reunification of the fatherland and strengthening the democratic base."

The congratulatory telegram pointed out that the United States continues to instruct Syngman Rhee to expand armaments and prepare for war, and has concluded a "mutual defense treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, openly implementing its war policy in China and Asia. The congratulatory telegram emphasized that these series of facts require the peoples of Korea and China to heighten their vigilance, further strengthen their own strength, and further consolidate the combat solidarity and friendly relations between our two peoples.

The congratulatory telegram concluded: "I wish the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers even greater achievements and victories in the new year in the common great cause of further consolidating the Korean Armistice, defending the freedom and happiness of the peoples of Korea and China, and safeguarding peace and security in Asia."

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 1st. All commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers sent a telegram to Marshal Kim Il-sung on New Year's Day, 1955, congratulating him on the New Year.

The congratulatory telegram stated: "Respected Marshal Kim Il-sung, on the occasion of New Year's Day, 1955, we extend to you our highest respect and heartfelt congratulations. During the arduous war years of resisting U.S. imperialist aggression, the Korean people, the close comrades-in-arms of the Chinese people, displayed unparalleled heroic spirit in defending the freedom and independence of their fatherland and safeguarding the cause of peace in Asia and the world. After stopping the aggressive war launched by the enemy and achieving the great victory of the Korean Armistice, we have seen the peace-loving Korean people engaged in creative and selfless labor to build their beautiful life. The spirit of the Korean people who love their country, love peace, and love labor has deeply moved us. The unbreakable combat friendship forged with blood by the peoples of Korea and China has deepened day by day. We firmly believe that the strong unity of the people of all countries in the socialist peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union is the most reliable guarantee for safeguarding peace."

The congratulatory telegram stated: "Now the U.S. aggression group and its followers are still not reconciled to the failure of their war policy. They continue to intensify international tensions in the East and West, prepare for a new world war, and keep the Korean Armistice in an unstable situation. We will continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with the heroic Korean People's Army to strictly guard our positions, strengthen our vigilance, and enhance our preparedness, and continue to strive for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue!"

    金日成元帅电人民军和志愿军祝贺新年
    志愿军全体指战员电金日成元帅祝贺
    【新华社平壤一日电】朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅在一月一日打电报给朝鲜人民军全体将士，祝贺新年。
    贺电说：一九五四年是朝鲜人民在为加强祖国革命的民主基地，恢复和发展战后人民经济，实现祖国的和平统一、独立的斗争中，取得巨大成就的胜利的一年。朝鲜人民的武装力量——人民军和中国人民志愿军一起，严格地遵守了停战协定，并且铜墙铁壁般地保卫了人民的和平的创造性劳动成果。
    贺电说：美帝国主义者和李承晚匪帮看到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国日益成长的各方面的力量而感到不安。最近，它们企图抹煞共和国政府一系列的关于促进祖国的和平统一的正当建议，进行罪恶的战争煽动。贺电着重指出，如果美帝国主义者和李承晚匪帮无视朝鲜人民的正当要求，而重新发动对朝鲜人民的冒险行动，那末，他们一定要遭到朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的决定性的打击。
    贺电最后要人民军全体将士警惕地监视美帝国主义者和李承晚匪帮的活动，钢铁般地保卫父母兄弟们的巨大的创造性劳动成果和民主基地。
    【新华社平壤一日电】朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅在一九五五年一月一日打电报给中国人民志愿军全体指挥员和战斗员，祝贺新年。
    贺电说：在过去的一年中，英雄的中国人民志愿军将士们在朝鲜北半部的前沿和后方继续建立了光辉的功绩。中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军一起，巩固了朝鲜停战，警惕地守卫了朝鲜人民的创造性的劳动成果，而且对朝鲜的战后人民经济恢复建设给予了莫大的帮助。这种忘我的斗争和友谊的协助，进一步加强了朝鲜人民在为祖国的和平统一和加强民主基地的事业中的胜利信心。
  贺电指出了美国继续指使李承晚扩军备战，并且和蒋介石匪帮缔结了“共同防御条约”，在中国和亚洲露骨地实行它的战争政策。贺电强调说：这
  一系列的事实，要求朝中两国人民提高警惕，进一步加强自己的力量，进一步巩固我们两国人民之间的战斗团结和友谊关系。
    贺电最后说：我预祝兄弟般的中国人民志愿军将士们在新的一年中，在为进一步巩固朝鲜停战，保卫朝中两国人民的自由幸福和亚洲的和平与安全的共同的伟大事业中，取得更大的成就和胜利。
    【新华社平壤一日电】中国人民志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员在一九五五年元旦致电金日成元帅祝贺新年。
    贺电说：敬爱的金日成元帅，值此一九五五年元旦之际，谨向您致以崇高的敬意与热诚的祝贺。在反抗美帝国主义侵略的艰苦的战争岁月里，中国人民亲密的战友——朝鲜人民为保卫自己祖国的自由独立，维护亚洲及世界和平事业，表现了高尚无比的英雄气概；当制止了敌人发动的侵略战争，取得了朝鲜停战的伟大胜利以后，我们又看到了热爱和平的朝鲜人民为了建设自己美好的生活，进行着创造性的忘我的劳动。朝鲜人民爱祖国、爱和平、爱劳动的精神，使我们受到很深的感动。朝、中两国人民以鲜血结成的牢不可破的战斗友谊，已日益加深。我们深信：以苏联为首的社会主义和平民主阵营各国人民的坚强的团结，是保卫和平的最可靠的保证。
    贺电说：现在美国侵略集团和它的追随者仍不甘心于他们的战争政策的失败。他们在东方和西方继续加剧国际紧张局势，准备新的世界战争，并使朝鲜停战始终处于不稳定的局面。我们将继续与英雄的朝鲜人民军并肩严守阵地，以高度的警惕，加强戒备，为争取朝鲜问题的和平解决继续努力奋斗！
