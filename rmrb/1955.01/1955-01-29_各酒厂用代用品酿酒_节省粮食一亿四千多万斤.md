Various Breweries Use Substitutes to Brew Wine
Saving More Than 140 Million Jin of Grain

Last year, breweries under the Ministry of Light Industry used substitutes to manufacture alcohol and baijiu (white liquor), saving an estimated 144.5 million jin of grain according to incomplete statistics. The substitutes used by the breweries included fresh sweet potatoes, dried sweet potatoes, fresh potatoes, dried cassava, dried potatoes, as well as rice bran and wheat bran. Last year, substitutes accounted for more than 55 percent of the total material usage in the breweries, saving approximately 14.5 billion yuan in costs. After using substitutes, the factories basically ensured the quality of their products. The baijiu had a slight sweet potato flavor, but the quality of the liquor was not reduced. (Bai Heng)

    各酒厂用代用品酿酒
    节省粮食一亿四千多万斤
    轻工业部所属各酿酒厂去年使用代用品制造酒精、白酒，据不完全统计约节省粮食一亿四千五百多万斤。各酿酒厂使用的代用品有鲜白薯、白薯干、鲜土豆、木薯干、土豆干以及谷糠、麸皮等。去年各酿酒厂使用的代用品占总用料量百分之五十五以上，约节省成本费一百四十五亿元。各厂使用代用品后，基本上保证了产品质量，白酒少许带有白薯味道，但酒的质量并没有降低。（白衡）
