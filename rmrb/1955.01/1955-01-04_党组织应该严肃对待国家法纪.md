Party Organizations Should Seriously Treat National Laws and Disciplines
By our reporter Cao Baoming

On the morning of July 25th last year, Li Guilin (probationary party member), the section chief of the riveting section of the Wuchang Shipyard, accepted the task of riveting a steel plate. This steel plate, weighing more than 600 kilograms, needed to be turned over for construction. Originally, turning the steel plate was the job of the previous process, but Li Guilin did not strictly implement the handover system and vaguely accepted it. Before turning the steel plate, the worker Wang Shihe suggested to him: "Someone should support the foot of the steel plate on the back." He didn't listen and didn't study the operating methods, but blindly directed. As a result, when the steel plate was erected about half a person high, it slid and fell because no one was supporting the foot of the steel plate on the back, injuring the worker Wang Shihe. At this time, the worker Yuan Jinhan suggested to Li Guilin again: "We can't turn it over by hand anymore, we need to use a crane." The worker Gu Jigen also said: "There is a crane next to it, why not use it?" He replied: "There is no one on the crane." Yuan Jinhan told him again: "There is someone on the crane." But he thought it was too much trouble to use a crane and emphasized the lack of "jacks" and other reasons, and still did not accept the worker's suggestion. He then remembered that turning the steel plate was not his job, so he went to the section chief of the previous process. He met Fan Genrong, a level seven worker from the previous process, in the middle and pulled Fan to help turn the steel plate. However, he only said to Fan simply: "It slipped when we turned it over just now and injured Wang Shihe, we have to pay attention." After he finished speaking, he left the scene on his own. Fan Genrong found a few workers and erected the steel plate again. Because no one was responsible for directing at the scene and the workers were not in sync, the right corner of the steel plate slid again, killing the worker Wang Miaogen and injuring the worker Sun Mugeng. After the accident, the relevant authorities sent people to the factory for a joint inspection and believed that this major casualty accident was basically caused by Li Guilin's mistakes, and initially put forward opinions on the handling of the relevant personnel.

Serious differences arose on the handling of Li Guilin's case. Initially, the joint inspection team of relevant authorities believed that Li Guilin should be given an administrative punishment of dismissal and at the same time suggested that the Wuhan Municipal People's Procuratorate conduct an investigation and deal with him according to the severity of the circumstances; the majority of the members of the Wuchang Shipyard Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward "reasons" such as "the factory's system is not sound," Li Guilin "is very honest," and "he is active in his work on weekdays" and "his motives are good," advocating only a demerit. Later, according to the investigation results, the Wuhan Municipal People's Procuratorate believed that Li Guilin was guilty of dereliction of duty and the circumstances were serious and that, in accordance with Article 100 of the Constitution and Article 16 of the Outline of Internal Labor Rules for State-Owned Enterprises, he should be subject to criminal punishment. After receiving the report from the Party Group of the Municipal Procuratorate, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China believed that it was necessary to enforce the law and discipline strictly to protect the country's economic construction and made a "Li Guilin should be subject to criminal punishment for dereliction of duty" instruction. The Wuchang Shipyard Party Committee felt "very sudden" and that it was a "new problem" when they saw the municipal committee's instruction. However, instead of actively studying and understanding the spirit of the instruction and raising their ideological level a step higher, they continued to emphasize the objective reasons for the accident and worried that such handling might commit the mistake of "punitiveism." They even believed that the Wuhan Municipal Committee only made the instruction based on the report of the Party Group of the Municipal Procuratorate (the Wuchang Shipyard Party Committee did not make a written report on this accident to the higher-level party committee) and that the municipal committee "did not understand the actual situation." At the same time, they quibbled over certain factual details in the report of the Party Group of the Municipal Procuratorate, delaying the matter for a month. Later, the higher-level party committee urged them to write a report, and it took them three days (this affected the then-current production increase and economy drive) to reinvestigate and compile a report. In fact, the facts narrated in this report were no different from those in the report of the Party Group of the Municipal Procuratorate, but when analyzing the cause of the accident, they still emphasized "reasons" such as "the system is not sound" and insisted on only giving Li Guilin an administrative punishment - dismissal. This matter was dragged on until October 29th, when Li Erzhong, the third secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee, convened a discussion with Liu Guangquan, the secretary of the Wuchang Shipyard Party Committee, and responsible party members and cadres of relevant units. In this discussion, everyone strictly criticized the erroneous opinions of the Wuchang Shipyard Party Committee, and Liu Guangquan, the secretary of the factory party committee, also made a preliminary self-criticism. Only then was this accident handled correctly.

Where did the Wuchang Shipyard Party Committee of the Communist Party of China err in handling Li Guilin's responsibility accident? As the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out: They did not treat revolutionary legality with an attitude of being responsible to the working class and being responsible to the socialist cause, and did not seriously handle responsibility accidents.

They mistakenly thought that the laws of the country only applied to counter-revolutionaries, habitual thieves, and hooligans, and did not clearly realize that everyone must abide by the law, and that Communist Party members and state functionaries should be models of abiding by the law. Liu Guangquan, the secretary of the factory party committee, also reviewed afterwards, saying: "How could I realize that a state functionary like Li Guilin, who has a clean history and is active in his work, should be given legal sanctions when he violates state laws in his work?" The Wuhan Municipal Committee has made it clear that Li Guilin must bear legal responsibility for the serious accident that caused death and injury due to serious irresponsibility. His active work on weekdays and good motives can only be used as a reference for the sentencing of the judicial organs and cannot be the reason for not giving legal punishment. The reasoning is very clear. But the Wuchang Shipyard Party Committee did not recognize this, they emphasized "being responsible for a cadre," and since Li Guilin "is active in his work on weekdays" and "his motives are not bad," it seemed unreasonable to give him criminal punishment. According to their understanding, it means: a person who commits a crime can be forgiven because he is active in his work on weekdays, and he will not be given legal punishment; as long as a person's motives are good, he does not have to be responsible for the consequences of his actions; as a factory's party organization, he can only be responsible for cadres who he thinks are good, and he does not have to be responsible for the safety of the lives of all workers in the factory. This approach is obviously wrong. The result of this will be that some people in society can be free from the constraints of national laws, which will weaken the power of revolutionary legality and make the interests of the people and the socialist cause lack legal protection. According to workers, some of the workers who participated in turning the steel plate saw that Li Guilin repeatedly refused to accept the workers' suggestions and did not consider production safety, and felt that their lives were not guaranteed, so they excused themselves to go to the toilet and did not participate in the second turning of the steel plate. This more specifically illustrates that if the lawbreakers and criminals are not seriously punished according to the law, the masses of workers will feel that the national law does not give their lives practical protection, and their enthusiasm for work will be greatly restricted, which is very detrimental to our socialist construction cause.

The Wuchang Shipyard Party Committee mistakenly opposed the implementation of discipline and education, emphasizing that they were afraid of making the mistake of punitiveism and did not dare to strictly enforce discipline. In the past, when they implemented discipline, they did not do enough education work for the masses, and did not form an atmosphere of moral resistance to behaviors that corrupt labor discipline among the broad masses. Therefore, the higher authorities once reminded them to prevent the bias of punitiveism. But they did not seriously understand the spirit of the instructions from higher authorities, and they still did not understand that severely punishing those who violate laws and disrupt discipline would actually have great educational significance for everyone. At the same time, as long as the punishment is correct, and attention is paid to conducting full education for the masses and the punished during the implementation of discipline, the mistake of punitiveism will not be committed. They disagreed with Li Guilin's criminal punishment because they were afraid of making mistakes in punitiveism and feared affecting other people's enthusiasm. What was the response of the masses to their attitude? Everyone has been watching to see how the leadership will deal with Li Guilin's mistake. Immediately afterwards, a seventh-grade worker violated the operating procedures, resulting in the scrapping of a 75-horsepower diesel engine base and body, and the loss of more than 8 million yuan in state property. The leadership was also slow to deal with this matter. The workers were very dissatisfied and said, "If seventh-grade and eighth-grade workers have accidents and are not dealt with, what is it to us third-grade and fourth-grade workers to have a little accident!"

Labor discipline at the Wuchang Shipyard is lax, accidents are frequent, and machines are damaged a lot. In one year and ten months, there have been more than 700 casualties, killing five people and seriously injuring eight. The loss of state property in wages and production alone is more than 1.33 billion yuan. This situation is inseparable from the factory party committee's failure to attach importance to revolutionary legality and its failure to seriously handle responsibility accidents. The mechanical workshop of this factory damaged 28 machine tools in the first half of last year.

When the Wuchang Shipyard Party Committee corrected its mistakes, correctly handled Li Guilin's problem, and actively carried out the education of revolutionary legality to the masses, the morale of the masses was not affected in any way. On the contrary, everyone believed that Li Guilin should be given criminal punishment.

Under the leadership of the Wuhan Municipal Committee, this matter has now come to an end: Li Guilin has been sentenced to imprisonment by the People's Court according to law; the Wuchang Shipyard Party Committee is actively using this case to educate the masses on revolutionary legality and labor discipline, and at the same time strengthening safe production work. However, the lessons of this matter are worth remembering, especially today, when revolutionary legality is becoming more and more complete after the promulgation of the Constitution.

    党组织应该严肃对待国家法纪
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    去年七月二十五日上午，武昌造船厂铆钉工段段长李桂林（候补党员）接受了铆一块铁板的任务。这块重达六百多公斤的铁板，需要翻个面才能施工。本来，翻铁板是属于上一工序的工作，但李桂林没有严格执行交接制度，含糊地就将它接受下来。在翻这块铁板之前，工人王世和向他建议：“铁板背面脚点要有人顶住。”他不听，也没有研究操作方法，就盲目指挥起来。结果铁板竖起约半人高时，因为铁板背面脚点无人顶住，滑动倒下，把工人王世和打伤了。这时候，工人袁金汉又向李桂林建议：
  “再不能用人翻了，要用吊车吊。”工人顾纪根也说：“旁边有吊车，为什么不用吊车呢？”他回答说：“吊车上没人。”袁金汉又告诉他：“吊车上有人。”但他嫌用吊车麻烦，强调没有“千斤”等理由，仍旧不接受工人建议。他又想起翻铁板不是自己的工作，就去找前一工序的工段长。中途遇见前一工序的七级工人范根荣，他就拉范来帮助翻铁板。但是，他只向范简单说了一句：“刚才翻滑了，打伤了王世和，要想办法注意。”说完了，就自行离开现场。范根荣找来几个工人又把铁板竖起，因为现场没有人负责指挥，工人步调不一致，结果铁板右角又滑动，把工人王妙根打死，工人孙穆庚打伤。事故发生后，有关机关都派人到厂进行了联合检查，认为这次重大伤亡事故基本上是由李桂林的错误造成的，并初步提出了对有关人员的处理意见。
    在处理李桂林的意见上，发生了严重的分歧。最初，有关机关联合检查组认为李桂林在行政上应受撤职处分，同时建议由武汉市人民检察署进行侦讯，按其情节轻重依法处理；中共武昌造船厂委员会多数委员却提出了“本厂制度不健全”，李桂林“很老实”、“平日工作积极”、“动机善良”等“理由”，主张只给记过处分。后来，武汉市人民检察署根据侦讯结果，认为李桂林玩忽职守，情节严重，按照宪法第一百条和国营企业内部劳动规则纲要第十六条规定，应受刑事处分。中共武汉市委接到市检察署党组的报告后，认为必须严肃法纪以保卫国家经济建设，就作了“李桂林玩忽职守，应受刑事处分”的批示。武昌造船厂党委会见到市委批示感到“很突然”，“是个新问题”。但是，他们又不积极地去研究领会批示的精神，把自己的思想水平提高一步。相反地，他们仍然强调发生事故的客观原因，顾虑这样处理可能犯“惩办主义”的错误。他们甚至认为武汉市委只是根据市检察署党组的报告作批示（武昌造船厂党委没有把这次事故向上级党委作书面报告），市委“不了解实际情况”。同时他们还在市检察署党组报告中某些事实细节上纠缠不清，使事情拖了一个月。后来，上级党委催他们写报告，这才花了三天时间（这样做使当时的增产节约运动受到了影响），重新进行调查，整理出一份报告来。其实这个报告中所叙述的事实与市检察署党组的报告并没有出入，只是在分析事故原因时，他们仍然强调“制度不健全”等“理由”，坚持只给李桂林行政处分——撤职。这件事情一直拖到十月二十九日，武汉市委第三书记李尔重召集武昌造船厂党委书记刘广泉和有关单位党员负责干部讨论。在这次讨论中，大家严格地批判了武昌造船厂党委会的错误意见，该厂党委书记刘广泉也作了初步检讨。这才使这件事故得以正确处理。
    中共武昌造船厂委员会在处理李桂林责任事故中的错误在哪里呢？正如中共武汉市委所指出的：他们不是以对工人阶级负责，对社会主义事业负责的态度来对待革命法制，严肃处理责任事故。
    他们错误地以为国家的法律只对反革命分子、惯窃和流氓才适用，而没有明确地认识到法律人人必须遵守，共产党员和国家机关工作人员更应该成为守法的模范。这个厂党委书记刘广泉事后也检讨说：“像李桂林这样历史清白，工作积极的国家工作人员，在工作中违犯了国家法律时，我怎么也认识不到应该给以法律制裁。”武汉市委已经明确指出，李桂林由于严重不负责任而造成了打死、打伤人的严重事故，他就必须负法律责任。他平日工作积极和动机不坏等，只能作为审判机关量刑时的参考，绝不能因此不给予法律处分。道理是很明白的。但武昌造船厂党委会却不这样认识，他们强调“要对一个干部负责”，李桂林既然“平日工作积极”，“动机不坏”，如果给予刑事处分，似乎就说不过去。按照他们这种认识，就是说：一个人犯了罪，就可以因为他平日工作积极原谅他，而不给予法律处分；一个人只要动机善良，就可以不对他的行动后果负责；作为一个工厂的党组织就可以只对自己认为好的干部负责，而不必对全厂工人的生命安全负责。这样做法显然是错误的。这样作的结果，就会使社会上出现一些可以不受国家法律约束的人，就会削弱了革命法制的威力，使人民利益和社会主义事业缺乏法律的保障。据工人反映，就在这次事故发生时，有些参加翻铁板的工人看见李桂林一再不接受工人建议，不考虑生产安全，就感到生命没有保障，借口上厕所，而不参加第二次翻铁板的工作。这就更具体说明如果再不严肃地依法给违法犯罪分子以法律处分，工人群众就会感觉到国家法律并没有给他们的生命以切实的保障，他们的劳动积极性就会受到很大的限制，这对我们的社会主义建设事业是很不利的。
    武昌造船厂党委会错误地把执行纪律和教育对立起来，强调怕犯惩办主义的错误，就不敢严格执行纪律。过去他们在执行纪律时，对群众的教育工作作得不够，没有在广大群众中形成从道德上抵制败坏劳动纪律行为的风气。所以上级机关曾经提醒过他们要防止惩办主义的偏向。但他们没有认真领会上级指示的精神，还不懂得对违法乱纪的人严肃地给予处分，实际上对大家就会有很大的教育意义，同时，只要处分是正确的，而且在执行纪律时，注意对群众对受处分者进行充分的教育，就不会犯惩办主义的错误。他们因为怕犯惩办主义错误、怕影响别人的积极性，不同意李桂林应受刑事处分，而群众对他们这种态度是什么反映呢？大家一直都在观望着，看领导上怎样处理李桂林的错误。紧接着，一个七级工人违反操作规程，造成七十五马力的柴油机机座与机身报废事故，损失国家财产八百多万元。领导上对这件事也迟迟不作处理。工人很不满意，都说：“七级、八级工人出了事故都不处理，我们三级、四级工人出点事故算什么！”
    武昌造船厂劳动纪律松弛，事故频繁，机器损坏很多，在一年零十个月中，伤亡事故竟达七百多次，死五人，重伤八人，仅工资与生产两项就损失国家财产十三亿三千多万元。这个厂机械车间去年上半年便损坏了机床二十八部。这种情况是和厂里党委不重视革命法纪、不严肃处理责任事故的错误分不开的。
    当武昌造船厂党委纠正了自己的错误，正确地处理了李桂林的问题，积极地向群众进行革命法制的教育以后，群众情绪并没有受什么影响，相反地大家都认为李桂林应受刑事处分。
    在武汉市委领导下，这件事情现在已告一段落：李桂林已由人民法院依法判处了徒刑；武昌造船厂党委会正积极地通过这个案件向群众进行革命法制与劳动纪律的教育，同时加强安全生产工作。但这件事的教训却值得我们很好记取，特别是在宪法公布以后，革命法制正日趋完备的今天。
