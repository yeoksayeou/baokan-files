    The people along the coast of Fujian are stepping up preparations to support the front lines
    According to Xinhua News Agency: Fishermen and people from all walks of life in the coastal areas of Fujian Province have recently held various meetings to angrily denounce the US-Chiang war treaty. The Ninth District of Lianjiang County held a meeting of fishermen's representatives on New Year's Eve. At the meeting, Lin Fafu, a fisherman from Huangqi Town, angrily accused the Chiang bandit army of persecuting fishermen. The Chiang bandit army had successively captured 93 fishermen from Huangqi Town at sea, and the lives and deaths of 76 of them are unknown; the Chiang bandit army also occupied fishing grounds, making it impossible for more than 800 fishermen in the town to go out to sea to fish, and the lives of more than 4,000 people have suffered difficulties. He said: We fishermen in Huangqi Town will always remember this hatred and will do our best to support the liberation of Taiwan.
    At a rally held on Dongshan Island, Lin Dafu and Fang Xuehua, first-class heroes of the militia, and Liu Xing, the "mother of the coastal defense fighters," all spoke at the meeting. They unanimously stated that they would unite the 90,000 people on the island, increase production, heighten vigilance, and fight to support the liberation of Taiwan. At a meeting of more than 1,200 representatives from all walks of life in Pingtan County, Wei Gangchang, a representative of the provincial people's congress and chairman of the fishery production cooperative, represented the fishermen of the county and said that they would go to sea earlier, work hard, and catch more fish to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan by increasing production. They will also strengthen their study of ship handling techniques and be ready to support the front lines at any time; strengthen sentry posts, strictly guard the sea crossings, and prevent a single spy from escaping.
    Shanghai ship workers repair ships in the face of strong wind and snow
    According to Xinhua News Agency: Ship workers and sailors in Shanghai, with the determination to liberate Taiwan, began their work in 1955. In the past few days, ship repair workers at the Shanghai Ship Repair and Shipbuilding Plant have been busy repairing ships on the frozen beach in the face of strong wind and snow. Young fitter Yu Delin completed the task of assembling a ship's anchor winch six hours ahead of schedule on the snowy night of the 5th. Around the New Year, thousands of sailors from the Shanghai Maritime Bureau held meetings to oppose the US-Chiang "mutual defense treaty." The heroic "Yuzhan" fleet completed the 1954 transportation task ahead of schedule after several fierce battles with US-Chiang warships. Now, they are confidently starting to carry out the 1955 transportation task.
    Sailors, trainees of the preparatory sailor training class, and students of the shipbuilding school expressed their willingness to work hard to learn technology for the liberation of Taiwan.
    Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative strives to expand production
    According to Xinhua News Agency: Members of the Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, recently held a meeting to oppose the US-Chiang treaty. Han En, a representative of the National People's Congress, said at the meeting: Premier Zhou's statement powerfully exposed the heinous conspiracy of US imperialism to expand its aggression against China and undermine the construction of a happy life for our people. Our cooperative will formally transform into a fully socialist agricultural production cooperative. We will lead the surrounding farmers to take the road of collectivization and strive to increase grain production to support the liberation of Taiwan. The members unanimously proposed at the meeting to produce more grain in accordance with the national plan and be ready to support the liberation of Taiwan at any time. At present, the members are sending manure to the fields, striving to send 4,800 carts of manure to the fields before the thaw; at the same time, they are carrying out various winter sideline productions, striving to increase the sideline income by 100 million to 140 million yuan before the spring plowing, and using all of this income as investment for expanding production. They also plan to build a small reservoir and a flood control embankment this year, and reclaim 50 hectares of new dry and paddy fields, and cultivate 50 hectares of dry fields with tractors and new farm implements. The preliminary production expansion plan for this year formulated by the Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative requires that 140 hectares of paddy fields and 115 hectares of dry fields in the cooperative produce 1,559,500 kilograms of grain. After the implementation of this plan, 900,000 kilograms of surplus grain will be sold to the state this year.
    Fishermen in various parts of Hainan Island launch fishing competitions
    [Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 9th] Encouraged by the slogan of supporting the liberation of Taiwan, fishermen in various parts of Hainan Island have launched a production increase competition. After discussing Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the US-Chiang "mutual defense treaty," the members of the five fishery production cooperatives in Lingshui County, Lehui County, and Wenchang County all stated that the fishermen on each fishing boat should strive to exceed the original production increase plan by 20%. Eight fishery production mutual aid groups and forty-eight independent fishing boats in Wanning, Qiongdong, and other counties also actively participated in the production increase competition. All members of the Ganchongsha First Fishery Production Cooperative in Dan County stated at a meeting against the US-Chiang treaty that they would better lead the independent fishermen to achieve universal production increases. Now, countless fishing boats are setting sail to sea to fish.
