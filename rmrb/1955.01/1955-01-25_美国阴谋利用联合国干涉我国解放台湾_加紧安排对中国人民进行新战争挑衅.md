Xinhua News Agency, January 24th: U.S. government leaders have recently made successive statements on the issue of U.S. aggression against Taiwan. From these statements, people can see that the U.S. aggressive bloc is plotting a new conspiracy, attempting to use the United Nations to interfere in the Chinese people's liberation of the coastal islands of China and Taiwan and Penghu, and to legalize the aggressive activities of the U.S. aggressive bloc in occupying China's territory of Taiwan and Penghu as a war base.

U.S. President Eisenhower said at a press conference on the 19th that he would like to see the United Nations "mediate" to "stop the fighting along the Chinese coast." The day before, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles had also made similar remarks at a press conference, almost simultaneously with the Chinese People's Liberation Army's liberation of Yijiangshan Island. He also threatened that the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan would "involve" the United States, and would therefore be an "international conflict."

Many reports reveal that the so-called "UN-mediated ceasefire" by senior U.S. officials is ulterior motive. The Kuomintang traitor Chiang Kai-shek's Central News Agency quoted Washington diplomatic observers on the 19th as saying, "If the United Nations proposes a ceasefire and Communist China ignores it, the United States will have the moral support of the United Nations to implement the joint defense treaty between the Republic of China and the United States, and may even receive military assistance from the United Nations if Taiwan is attacked by the Chinese Communists." The Japanese news agency Kyodo News also pointed out on the 20th that the intention of the U.S.'s so-called "ceasefire" proposal is: "The United States is attempting to have the United Nations intervene in the Chinese civil war."

All the facts show that the U.S.'s so-called "UN-mediated ceasefire" contains a dual purpose. On the one hand, it is attempting to steal the banner of the United Nations to cover up its occupation of China's territory of Taiwan and expand its war threat against China. On the other hand, it also wants to drag its allies into the water again. United Press International reported a concern expressed by London diplomatic circles, saying, "People are very worried that the United Nations may be dragged into a Korean War-style conflict."

Xinhua News Agency, January 24th: Behind the smokescreen of the "UN-mediated ceasefire," the U.S. government is stepping up arrangements for new war provocations against the Chinese people, and is using atomic weapons for intimidation.

According to U.S. news agencies, the U.S. government will soon submit a request to Congress, asking Congress to authorize the President to use U.S. armed forces to "defend" Taiwan and "military outer positions," including the coastal islands of mainland China occupied by the Chiang bandits. Congress is prepared to immediately pass a relevant proposal authorizing the President to use U.S. armed forces in the above-mentioned areas to support the Chiang bandit troops.

At the same time, tense war deployments are underway in the Taiwan area. According to reports, U.S. Seventh Fleet Commander Pride, responsible for "defending" Taiwan, rushed to Taipei from Hong Kong on the 23rd and immediately held emergency meetings with Chiang bandits and U.S. military personnel stationed in Taiwan. He then took a ship north and will return to Taipei for further consultations after "inspecting" the U.S. fleet preparing to provoke on the Taiwan sea.

At the same time, it was revealed that three U.S. aircraft carriers and other warships sailing from Manila passed through the Taiwan sea on the 23rd and headed for the Dachen area. At this time, U.S. Department of Defense officials released information saying that the U.S. fleet in the Taiwan sea is equipped with atomic bombs and threatened to use atomic bombs when necessary.

In view of the above signs, it is even more convinced here that the so-called "UN-mediated ceasefire" by senior U.S. officials is a complete deception, and its purpose is only to cover up the U.S. authorities' planning of new war provocations.

### 美国阴谋利用联合国干涉我国解放台湾  加紧安排对中国人民进行新战争挑衅

    美国阴谋利用联合国干涉我国解放台湾
    加紧安排对中国人民进行新战争挑衅
    【新华社二十四日讯】美国政府首脑近日接连就美国侵略台湾问题发表谈话。从这些谈话中，人们看出，美国侵略集团正在策划一个新的阴谋，想要利用联合国来干涉中国人民解放中国沿海岛屿和台湾、澎湖，并且使美国侵略集团侵占中国领土台湾和澎湖作为战争基地的侵略活动合法化。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔十九日在记者招待会上说，他愿意看到联合国进行“斡旋”，来“停止中国沿海的战斗”。在这前一天，美国国务卿杜勒斯在中国人民解放军解放一江山岛的几乎同时，也曾在记者招待会上发表过类似的谈话。他同时还恫吓说，中国人民解放台湾将“牵连”美国，因此将是一个“国际冲突”。
    许多消息透露，美国高级官员的所谓“由联合国斡旋停火”，是别有用心。蒋介石卖国集团的中央社十九日引华盛顿外交观察家的话透露，“如果联合国提议停火，而共产党中国竟然置之不理的话，这样一来，美国就得到联合国的道义支持来执行中华民国和美国的共同防御条约，说不定在台湾一旦遭到中共攻击的时候，甚至还会得到联合国的军事援助。”日本通讯社共同社二十日也指出美国的所谓“停火”建议的意图是：“美国企图使联合国干预国共内战”。
    种种事实表明，美国的所谓“联合国斡旋停火”包含双重目的，一方面，它是企图要盗用联合国的旗帜来掩盖它侵占中国领土台湾，扩大对中国的战争威胁；另一方面，它还想借此把它的盟国再一次拉下水。合众社报道伦敦外交界人士所表达的一种忧虑说，“人们非常担心，联合国可能卷入一个朝鲜战争式的冲突中去。”
    【新华社二十四日讯】美国政府在施放“由联合国斡旋停火”的烟幕后面，正加紧安排对中国人民的新战争挑衅，并以原子武器进行恫吓。
    据美国通讯社报道，美国政府即将向国会提出要求，要国会授权总统使用美国武装部队“保卫”台湾和“军事上的外围阵地”，包括蒋贼盘踞下的中国大陆沿海岛屿。国会里已准备随即通过一项有关提案，授权总统为上述地区动用美国武装部队，支持蒋贼军队。
    与此同时，紧张的战争部署已在台湾地区进行中。据消息说，美国负责“保卫”台湾的第七舰队司令普赖德已经在二十三日从香港赶到台北，并立即与蒋贼及驻台湾美国军事人员举行紧急会议，随即又乘舰北上，并将在“视察”在台湾海面准备挑衅的美国舰队之后回台北作进一步会商。
    同时，据透露，自马尼拉开出的三艘美国航空母舰及其他军舰已在二十三日经台湾海面驶往大陈地区。就在这个时候，美国国防部官员放出空气，说在台湾海面的这些美国舰队配备有原子弹，并威胁在必要时将使用原子弹。
    鉴于上述种种迹象，此间更加确信：美国高级官员们的所谓“联合国斡旋停火”，是彻头彻尾的欺骗，其目的只是用来掩护美国当局策划新的战争挑衅。
