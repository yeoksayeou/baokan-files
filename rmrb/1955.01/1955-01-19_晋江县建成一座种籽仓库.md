Jinjiang County Builds a Seed Warehouse

    The Fujian Provincial Department of Agriculture's Seed Management Office has completed the construction of a well-equipped seed warehouse in Jinjiang County. This warehouse can hold 500,000 jin of superior seeds, enough for sowing 50,000 mu.

    This warehouse is located close to the Jinjiang Special District Farm and next to the highway. It is situated on high ground with good ventilation and plenty of sunlight, and it has three drying grounds. This provides extremely favorable conditions for the purchase, storage, transportation, sales, and testing of improved varieties.

    In the past, because various localities lacked specialized warehouses for storing improved seeds, when the masses needed seeds, they were temporarily allocated from state grain warehouses, which often resulted in seed mixing, causing reduced yields. After the completion of this warehouse, the high-quality early rice "Nante No. 1," late rice "Wukejian," and various rice and wheat seeds carefully selected by farms, agricultural producers' cooperatives, and farmers in Jinjiang Special District will be purchased and stored. Next year, farmers in the various counties under the jurisdiction of the special district will receive a large quantity of pure and high-quality seeds from here.

    晋江县建成一座种籽仓库
    福建省农业厅种籽管理所，在晋江县兴建一座设备完善的种籽仓库现已完工。这个仓库可容纳五十万斤优良种籽，能供播种五万亩之用。
    这个仓库紧靠晋江专区农场，又在公路旁边，地高通风、阳光充足，并有三个晒场，这对良种收购、储藏、运销与试验都提供了极有利的条件。
    过去，各地因缺乏专门储藏良种的仓库，当群众需要种籽时，临时由国家粮食仓库拨出供应，常因此而发生种籽混杂的现象，造成了减产的损失。这一仓库建成后，今年晋江专区各地农场和农业生产合作社、农民等所精选的早稻“南特号”、晚稻“乌壳尖”等各种水稻、麦类的良种，将经过收购而储备起来，在明年，该专区所属各县的农民，就将从这里得到大量纯净优良的种籽。
