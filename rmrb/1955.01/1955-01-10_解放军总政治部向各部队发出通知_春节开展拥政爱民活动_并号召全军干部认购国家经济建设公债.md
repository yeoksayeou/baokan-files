Xinhua News Agency, January 9th—The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently issued a notice to all troops to guide the activities of supporting the government and cherishing the people during the Spring Festival in 1955.

    The notice stated: During holidays and festivals, all troops should hold joint celebrations with local residents or invite local residents to watch movies; during the production season, they should organize necessary labor to help the masses with production. Troops stationed in disaster areas should, during the activities of supporting the government and cherishing the people, hand over the food saved to the government for the relief of local disaster victims, and encourage the disaster victims to actively carry out production for self-relief. Around the Spring Festival, when officers and soldiers write letters to their families to celebrate the Spring Festival, they should publicize to their families the various specific policies of the country for carrying out socialist transformation, and promote the purchase of national economic construction bonds issued this year, etc.

    The notice required the leading organs of all troops to actively solicit opinions from local Party, government, and civil organizations during the Spring Festival, or send out investigation teams to investigate the mass discipline of the troops. If a small number of soldiers have violated laws and disciplines and harmed the interests of the masses in the past and have not been dealt with, they should be dealt with immediately in order to further enhance the unity between the army and the people.

    The notice pointed out: Troops stationed in coastal areas, border areas, and ethnic minority areas, in addition to carrying out activities to support the government and cherish the people in combination with specific circumstances, should also take strengthening the struggle to liberate Taiwan, protecting the interests of the people, helping the people with production, and earnestly respecting the customs and habits of fraternal ethnic groups as an important content.

    Xinhua News Agency, January 9th—The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army issued a notice calling on all officers and soldiers to enthusiastically subscribe to the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds.

    The notice stipulates that the subscription to bonds should be based on the principles of voluntariness and affordability; the subscription method can be adopted in the form of a one-time subscription with installment payments. The notice calls on all troops to strive to complete the subscription before the end of March.
