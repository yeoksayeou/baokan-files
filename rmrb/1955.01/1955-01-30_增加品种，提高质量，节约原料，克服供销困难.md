Increase Variety, Improve Quality, Conserve Raw Materials, Overcome Supply and Marketing Difficulties
The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

In the first half of last year, Tianjin's industrial production sector faced difficulties of insufficient raw material supply and sluggish product sales. The reason, from the perspective of industrial production itself, was mainly that factories had few product varieties, low quality, large waste, and high costs, meaning the produced goods could not meet the needs of the country and the people.

In April last year, we held a city-wide industrial conference, and in July, we held a city-wide Party Congress. At these two meetings, we established the policy of increasing variety and color, improving quality, conserving raw materials, and ensuring safe production, to actively overcome difficulties and improve production. In the past six months, many factories have conscientiously implemented this policy and made some achievements.

Regarding the conservation of raw materials, our approach is as follows:

To find substitutes for imported, valuable, and domestically scarce raw materials. According to incomplete statistics, there are now eighty-one relatively significant items that have been successfully tested. The Yongming Paint Industry Company, a joint state-private enterprise, could only meet 30% to 40% of its raw material needs with imported materials in the first quarter of last year, and some products even had to stop production as a result. Later, technicians and workers were organized to conduct joint research, and from January to August last year, twenty-eight substitutes were successfully tested, which not only maintained production but also saved more than 200,000 US dollars in foreign exchange.

To decide not to use raw materials that are optional. For example, gold powder was not used in cigarette boxes, saving more than two tons of gold powder; the trial production of natural-colored soy sauce was successful, eliminating the need for caramel coloring and saving grain, etc.

To strive to reduce consumption of raw materials that must be used. In cotton textile factories, saving cotton has become a mass movement. In the fourth quarter of last year alone, calculated based on the amount of cotton used per standard bolt, 364,000 catties of cotton were saved compared to the plan, and the unit cotton consumption per yarn piece decreased from 195.79 kg in the third quarter to 192.53 kg. The Hengda Tobacco Factory, a local state-owned enterprise, saved 340,000 kg of tobacco leaves from January to October compared to the plan. Factories generally paid attention to saving steel, with 938 tons saved on just twenty-four types of plumbing equipment.

To find ways to recover and reuse raw materials discarded during the production process. The local state-owned knitting factory recovers the overlock strips that used to be treated as waste, which can recover more than 275,000 kg per year, which can be spun into more than 860 pieces of recycled yarn. The state-owned Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory can recover 1,000 tons of pig iron every year. In addition, many methods have been devised to recover and utilize items such as cigarette boxes, toothpaste tubes, copper filings, and toothbrush handles.

Regarding increasing new varieties, according to preliminary statistics, a total of 201 major new products were put into production from January to September last year, of which 134 belonged to consumer goods and 67 belonged to means of production. Twenty types have been successfully tested and will soon be put into production. Ninety-two types were being tested in the fourth quarter.

Various local state-owned machine factories produced various machines and equipment for the country. For example, they manufactured crushing equipment, mineral processing equipment, and construction machinery for key projects such as the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant, and the Fuxin Coal Mine; they manufactured various hoisting equipment for the construction project of the Soviet Exhibition Hall; and they also manufactured some auxiliary equipment for some light industrial factories, etc. The factory workers all strove to overcome the difficulties of diverse varieties, urgent deadlines, and insufficient equipment in production. The Fifth Machine Factory signed a contract in January last year to manufacture hoisting equipment for the construction project of the Soviet Exhibition Hall. All the technicians used the Spring Festival holiday to design through the night, and the workers worked hard to rush the work. They delivered part of the goods in February and completed all the deliveries in March.

Various light industrial factories have increased varieties and improved colors to meet the needs of the people. The local state-owned weaving and dyeing factory could only dye blue cloth and blue cloth originally. Later, the workers overcame many technical and equipment difficulties and added eleven new products - dyeing silk and poplin, etc., which increased the profit paid to the state by 3.2 billion yuan at the end of the year. The joint state-private dyeing and finishing factory, according to the requirements of the trade department, successfully trial-produced two new products, Qingguang vulcanized blue cloth and Shilin blue cloth, without reducing output or increasing costs. Other products, such as the cardigan sweaters of the knitting factory and the skirt cloth of the No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory, are very popular with customers.

Among these new products, some are by-products of the production process, and some are raw materials or valuable raw materials that used to be imported. For example, the local state-owned electrolytic copper factory extracted 20 tons of lead from waste materials; the private Dongsheng Chemical Factory used the waste liquid from manufacturing direct jujube red to manufacture direct cyanine, which can increase the total value of production by 7% and save 86 million yuan in foreign exchange.

Regarding improving quality, fifty-six types of originally inferior products in the city have been significantly improved.

Many products have opened up sales channels due to improved quality. The local state-owned Paper Mill No. 2 implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts and solved the problem of oil penetration in asphalt paper. The products were overstocked in the first half of last year and are now not enough to sell. The graphite crucibles of the local state-owned Refractory Materials Factory used to be of poor quality and easily cracked, and generally could only be used for three firings. After implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts, they can now be used for more than a dozen firings; coupled with the efforts of the sales staff, sales channels have gradually opened up. The diesel engines and air compressors of the state-owned Power Machine Factory were once unsalable due to poor quality. Starting from the third quarter of last year, they gradually solved the key problems affecting product quality, such as increasing the service life of steel sleeves from 600 hours to 1,000 to 1,500 hours, thereby opening up sales channels. Other products such as asbestos tiles, glassware, felt boards, firebricks, and low-grade cigarettes have all seen sales start to improve due to improved quality.

Many factories, such as state-owned cotton textile factories, local state-owned woolen textile factories, and local state-owned Rubber Factory No. 2, have implemented new quality standards, and product quality has been significantly improved.

In order to ensure that the products are not damaged during transportation and to meet the needs of the people, many products have improved their packaging. For example, the original packaging of graphite crucibles used paper pads between products, but now they are replaced with rosin pads, which reduces damage during transportation. For example, paint was originally mostly packed in barrels of more than 20 kg, but now it is mostly changed to barrels of less than 5 kg; Ajinomoto used to be mostly in boxes of 1 kg, but now it has added small boxes of 46 grams, 31 grams, and 17 grams, so it meets the needs of the people and expands sales channels.

The quality of semi-finished products in some factories has also improved. For example, the scrap rate of castings in various machine factories has generally decreased. The scrap rate of nodular cast iron castings in the state-owned Tianjin Vehicle Factory was 14.28% in May and decreased to 6.6% in October.

The reason why we were able to achieve these results is because:

First, we conducted education on the purpose of production among workers, so that
the concept that "the purpose of industrial production is to meet the needs of the country and the people" is deeply rooted in people's hearts. At the city-wide industrial conference, leading cadres of various factories reviewed and criticized capitalist management ideas, and then widely carried out education on the purpose of production among the masses of employees. The methods of education were: organizing the masses to visit trade departments and user departments to solicit consumer opinions; visiting advanced factories to compare products; holding Party member meetings and employee representative meetings in various factories to check the shortcomings of their products; carrying out criticism and self-criticism, criticizing complacency and conservatism among workers; and in the fourth quarter, we focused on conducting publicity and education work to oppose conservative ideas and waste phenomena. This has improved the awareness of the broad masses of increasing variety, improving quality, and conserving raw materials, and established the concept of comprehensively completing the national plan.

Second, investigate and understand the supply, production, and sales situation. Including product sales, market needs, raw material production conditions, production of similar products, etc. The methods of investigation and understanding are: organizing investigation teams to go deep into various market towns and rural areas to conduct investigations; organizing industrial departments and trade departments to establish a regular contact system to provide each other with information and materials; holding industrial product exhibitions to widely solicit consumer opinions and establish contact with consumers. Based on the investigated and understood data and situation, and based on needs and possibilities, plans for increasing variety, improving quality, conserving and substituting raw materials are arranged separately.

Third, start from technology to solve key problems. Some factories propose topics from the leadership and mobilize the masses to find solutions; some factories organize technicians and workers around key problems to form several specialized groups to jointly study and solve them; some organize technicians to go to the workshops to specifically help workers solve a certain key problem; some incorporate the innovation proposals put forward by the masses into the administrative technical organization measures plan for implementation. This is the main method used by the vast majority of factories last year to solve the problems of few varieties, low quality, and large waste.

Fourth, carry out inter-factory competitions, especially competitions within the same industry. For example, in the dye industry, in carrying out competitions within the same industry, we first started with identifying the quality of the same products in various factories and checking material consumption, comparing and analyzing each other, and discovering, summarizing and promoting advanced experiences from them, solving key problems, and launching a labor competition with the goal of "learning from advanced factories." In the competition within the same industry in various rubber factories, they exchanged the experience of the Da Zhonghua Factory, and solved the quality problems that had not been solved for a long time. In addition to carrying out competitions, we also widely organized various factories to visit each other and learn advanced experience. Many factories go to advanced factories to learn before new products or new raw materials are put into production, and many factories have planned to go to factories in the same industry in other regions to learn, which has played a significant role in improving production.

Fifth, do a good job in preparing for the production of new products and new raw materials. Some factories that increase new products have carried out more thorough trial production work in advance. Many factories have also carefully tested new raw materials when they are used to prevent the phenomenon of product quality reduction and cost increase.

Sixth, some factories have begun to systematically strengthen technical management work, formulated new product quality standards and quality standards for semi-finished products and raw materials, focused on formulating process regulations, strengthened technical inspection organizations, strictly implemented inspection systems, and implemented technical responsibility systems. In terms of cost and finance, many factories have established a system to control raw material consumption, and promptly publicize the use of raw materials to guide the masses to actively conserve. For example, after the local state-owned cable factory implemented the quota material requisition system, it saved 7 tons of rubber in four months and improved the past phenomena of uneven thickness and poor quality of products leaving the factory.

These are the initial achievements Tianjin's industry has made in the past six months. However, this is just the beginning, and there are still many shortcomings in our work. For example, the waste of raw materials is still very large; some waste materials have not been utilized; some imported and valuable raw materials have not yet found suitable substitutes; the experience of conserving raw materials has not been summarized and promoted sufficiently, and a conservation system has not been universally established; the quality of forty-four types of products is still very poor, and some have been improved but are not consolidated; the increase in new products generally still focuses on changes in size and color, and cannot fully meet the needs of the country and the people.

In the future, we plan to continue to implement the industrial production policy stipulated by the city-wide Party Congress last year, systematically investigate market needs, strive to increase new varieties, continue to improve the quality of existing products, and vigorously conserve raw materials and find substitutes. To this end, we plan to put the strengthening of technical work in the first place, universally carry out technical education, cultivate technical forces, and rationally use existing engineering and technical personnel; deeply conduct education on cherishing machines, and strengthen the inspection and maintenance of machinery and equipment; strengthen production technical preparation work, and establish and improve the technical management system. Gradually establish a regular conservation system, improve cost and financial work, and control the consumption of raw materials; test substitutes in a planned and organized manner, and try to utilize the raw materials discarded during the production process as much as possible.

    增加品种，提高质量，节约原料，克服供销困难
    中共天津市委员会
    去年上半年，天津市的工业生产部门曾面临着原材料供应不足和产品销路不畅的困难。其原因就工业生产本身来说，主要是各厂的产品品种少，质量低，浪费大，成本高，生产出来的东西不能适应国家和人民的需要。
    去年四月，我们召开了全市工业会议，七月又召开了全市党代表大会。在这两次会议上，规定了增加品种花色、提高质量，节约原材料和安全生产的方针，来积极地克服困难，改进生产。半年多来，许多工厂认真执行了这个方针，做出了一些成绩。
    在节约原材料方面，我们的做法是：
    对进口的、贵重的和国内缺乏的原材料，设法采用代用品。据不完全的统计，现在已经试用成功的比较重大的，有八十一项。公私合营永明油漆工业公司去年一季度进口的原料只能满足需要量的百分之三十至四十，有的产品甚至因而停止生产。后来组织技术人员和工人共同研究，去年一至八月试用成功了二十八种代用品，不仅维持了生产，而且节约了外汇二十多万美元。
    对可用可不用的原材料，决定不用。如卷烟盒不用金粉，节约了两吨多金粉；试制原色酱油成功，不用糖色，节约了粮食等等。
    对必须使用的原材料，努力降低消耗。在各棉纺织厂，节约用棉已形成群众运动。仅去年第四季度按通扯用棉量计算，与计划比较即节约三十六万四千多市斤棉花，每件纱单位用棉量由第三季度的一九五点七九公斤减到一九二点五三公斤。地方国营恒大烟草厂从一月到十月比计划节约了三十四万公斤烟叶。各厂普遍注意了节约钢料，仅二十四种水暖器材就节约了九百三十八吨。
    生产过程中丢掉的原料，想办法收回再用。地方国营针织厂把过去当废料处理的包缝条回收起来，每年可以收回二十七万五千多公斤，可纺成再生纱八百六十多件。国营天津纺织机械厂每年可以回收一千吨生铁。此外，像卷烟盒、牙膏管、铜屑、牙刷把等，都想了很多办法回收利用。
    在增加新品种方面，据初步统计，去年一月至九月共有二百零一种主要新产品投入生产，其中属于生活资料的有一百三十四种，属于生产资料的有六十七种。有二十种已经试制成功，即将投入生产。在第四季中试制的有九十二种。
    各个地方国营的机器厂为国家生产了各种机器设备。如为第一汽车制造厂、哈尔滨量具刃具厂、阜新煤矿等重点工程制造了破碎设备、选矿设备、建筑机械；为苏联展览馆建筑工程制造了各式起重设备；还为一些轻工业工厂制造了部分附属设备等。各厂职工在生产中都努力克服了品种杂乱、时间紧急和设备不足的困难。第五机器厂去年一月份签订了为苏联展览馆建筑工程制造起重设备的合同，全体技术人员利用春节假日，连夜设计，工人们努力赶工，二月份就交了一部分货，三月份就全部交齐了。
    各个轻工业工厂都增加了品种，改进了花色，以适应人民需要。地方国营织染厂原来只能染青布和蓝布，后来职工们克服了许多技术上、设备上的困难，增加了十一种新产品——染罗缎和府绸等，年终多给国家上缴了三十二亿元的利润。公私合营染整厂根据贸易部门的要求，在不降低产量和不提高成本的情况下，试制成功了青光硫化青布和士林蓝布两种新产品。其他如针织厂的开襟绒衣和印染一厂的裙子布，都很受顾主的欢迎。
    在这些新产品中，有些是生产过程中的副产品，有些是过去要进口的原料或贵重的原料。如地方国营电解铜厂从废料中提炼出了二十吨铅；私营东升化工厂用制造直接枣红色的废液制造直接青莲色，可以增加生产总值百分之七，节约外汇八千六百万元。
    在提高质量方面，全市原来质量低劣的产品中，已有五十六种有显著改进。
    许多产品由于质量提高打开了销路。地方国营造纸二厂执行苏联专家建议，解决了沥青纸透油的问题，去年上半年产品积压，现在还不够卖。地方国营耐火器材厂的石墨坩埚原来质量不好，极易爆裂，一般的只能用三火，执行苏联专家建议后，现在可用十几火了；再加上销售人员的努力，销路已逐渐打开。国营动力机厂的柴油机和空气压缩机因质量不好，一度滞销。从去年第三季开始，他们逐步解决了影响产品质量的关键问题，如钢套的寿命从六百小时提高到一千至一千五百小时，从而打开了销路。其他如石棉瓦、玻璃器皿、毡板、耐火砖、低级卷烟等，都由于质量提高，销路开始好转。
    有许多工厂，像各国营棉纺织厂、地方国营毛织厂、地方国营橡胶二厂等，都推行了新的质量标准，产品质量有显著提高。
    为了保证产品运输途中不致损坏，和适合人民的需要，有许多产品改善了包装。如石墨坩埚原来包装时产品之间用纸垫，现在改用松香垫，运输时碰坏的就少了。又如油漆原来多是二十多公斤一桶，现在多改成五公斤以下一桶；味之素原来很多都是一公斤一盒，现在增加了四十六克、三十一克和十七克的小盒，这样就适合了人民的需要，扩大了销路。
    有些工厂的半成品的质量也提高了。如各机器厂的铸件报废率普遍下降，国营天津车辆厂球墨铸铁铸件的废品率，五月份是百分之十四点二八，十月份降低到了百分之六点六。
    我们所以能够取得这些成绩，是因为：
    第一，在工人中进行了生产目的性的教育，使
  “工业生产的目的是为了满足国家和人民需要”这一观念深入人心。在全市工业会议上，各厂领导干部检查和批判了资本主义经营思想，接着就在职工群众中广泛开展了生产目的性的教育。教育的方式是：组织群众访问贸易部门和使用部门，征求消费者的意见；参观先进工厂，进行产品比较；各厂召开党员大会和职工代表大会，检查本厂产品的缺点；开展批评和自我批评，批判工人中的自满、保守情绪；在第四季度又着重进行了反对保守思想和浪费现象的宣传教育工作。这样就使广大群众提高了对于增加品种、改进质量、节约原材料的自觉性，树立了全面完成国家计划的观念。
    第二，调查了解供产销情况。包括产品销路、市场需要、原料产地情况、同类产品生产情况等。调查了解的方法是：组织调查组深入各集镇和农村进行调查；组织工业部门和贸易部门建立经常的联系制度，互相供给情况及资料；举办工业产品展览会，广泛征集消费者意见，和消费者建立联系。根据调查了解的资料和情况，根据需要与可能，分别安排增加品种，提高质量、节约和代用原材料的计划。
    第三，从技术着手，解决关键问题。有的工厂由领导上提出课题，发动群众想办法解决；有的工厂围绕关键问题，组织技术人员和工人成立若干专门小组，共同研究解决；有的组织技术人员下车间，专门负责帮助工人解决某一关键问题；有的把群众提出的革新建议订入行政的技术组织措施计划中来贯彻执行。这是去年绝大多数工厂解决品种少、质量低、浪费大等问题的主要办法。
    第四，开展厂际竞赛，特别是开展同产业的竞赛。例如染料业在开展同产业竞赛中，首先从鉴定各厂相同产品的质量和检查材料消耗入手，互相比较、分析，从中发现、总结与推广先进经验，解决了关键问题，展开了以“向先进厂看齐”为目标的劳动竞赛。各橡胶厂在同产业竞赛中，交流了大中华厂的经验，解决了长期未能解决的质量问题。除开展竞赛之外，我们还广泛地组织各工厂相互参观和学习先进经验。许多厂在新产品或新原料投入生产以前，都先到先进工厂去学习，有不少工厂并有计划地到其他地区的同产业工厂去学习，对提高生产都起了重大作用。
    第五，做好新产品和新原料投入生产前的准备工作。有些增加新产品的工厂，事先进行了比较周密的试制工作。许多工厂在采用新的原材料时，也都认真地进行了试验，防止了产品质量降低和成本提高的现象。
    第六，部分工厂开始系统地加强技术管理工作，制订了新的产品质量标准和半成品、原材料的质量标准，有重点地制订了工艺规程，加强了技术检验组织，严格了检验制度，贯彻了技术责任制度。在成本财务方面，许多工厂建立了控制原材料消耗的制度，及时公布原材料使用情况，引导群众积极节约。如地方国营电缆厂实行了限额领料制度以后，四个月就节约了七吨橡胶，并改善了过去产品出厂粗细不匀、质量低劣的现象。
    这些就是天津工业半年多来所获得的初步成绩。但是，这仅仅是开始，我们工作中还存在着许多缺点。例如，原材料的浪费仍然很大；有些废料没有利用；有些进口的和贵重的原材料还没有找到适当的代用品；节约原材料的经验还总结和推广得很不够，还没有普遍建立起节约制度；有四十四种产品的质量仍旧很坏，有的虽有改进但不巩固；增加新产品一般还偏重于尺寸、花色的改变，还不能充分适应国家和人民的需要。
    今后，我们准备继续贯彻去年全市党代表大会规定的工业生产方针，有系统地进行对市场需要的调查，努力增加新品种，继续提高现有产品的质量，大力节约原材料和寻找代用品。为此，我们准备把加强技术工作提到首要地位，普遍开展技术教育，培养技术力量，合理使用现有的工程技术人员；深入进行爱护机器的教育，加强机器设备的检修维护工作；加强生产技术准备工作，建立和健全技术管理制度。逐步建立经常性的节约制度，改进成本财务工作，控制原材料的消耗；有计划有组织地试用代用品，和尽量利用生产过程中丢掉的原材料。
