To the Editor:

    The production of Guanggan oranges and tangerines in Jintang County, Sichuan Province, will exceed 11 million catties in 1954, an increase of approximately 11.4% compared to 1953. Increased fruit production is naturally a good thing for farmers. However, when the fruit is heavily marketed, state-owned companies and cooperatives are not actively purchasing it, leading to a serious backlog. In early and mid-December 1954, the daily market supply reached over 100,000 catties, sometimes even 200,000 catties, while state-owned and cooperative purchasing units only bought 10,000 to 20,000 catties per day. Some fruit farmers transported their fruit to the market, but could not sell it even after four or five days. Due to the large amount of fruit not being purchased in a timely manner, prices continued to decline. The originally set price of 550 yuan per catty for top-grade fruit has now fallen to 300 yuan, causing widespread dissatisfaction among fruit farmers.

    After discovering this problem, the Jintang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party promptly reported it to the Wenjiang Prefectural Committee, the Wenjiang Special District Finance Committee, the Special District Cooperative Office, and other relevant authorities, requesting solutions. The responses from the relevant units were that only the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the Provincial Cooperative General Society had the authority to take decisive measures. The County Committee then requested instructions from the Provincial General Society and the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, but they replied that they must adhere to the plan and could not purchase in large quantities. It turned out that the state-owned and cooperative purchasing units had set a small purchase plan for Guanggan oranges and tangerines, and they were unwilling to change the plan despite the large amount of fruit on the market. Under these circumstances, the Wenjiang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party instructed various localities to persuade fruit farmers to temporarily store the unsold fruit to alleviate the serious backlog in the market. The Prefectural Committee's measures were certainly correct, but I cannot understand the cooperative's mechanical adherence to the plan without considering the actual situation. It is understood that the fruit purchase plans of the Chengdu Municipal Cooperative Union, the Chengdu Food Company, and the Special District Trading Company combined are less than half of the total output. Doesn't such a plan seem very conservative? Why insist on a conservative plan and refuse to change it?

    With the improvement of people's living standards, the people's demand for fruits such as Guanggan oranges and tangerines is constantly increasing. The Party and government leaders of Jintang County have persuaded and educated farmers to develop fruit tree production with peace of mind, but the state-owned commercial and cooperative systems are unwilling to actively purchase them. How can this improve the production enthusiasm of fruit farmers?

### 金堂县果农要求合作社收购广柑和橘子

    金堂县果农要求合作社收购广柑和橘子编辑同志：
    四川省金堂县出产的广柑和橘子，一九五四年的产量将在一千一百万斤以上，比一九五三年增产约百分之十一点四。果子增产了，对农民来说当然是件好事情。但是，在果子大量上市的时候，国营公司和合作社，却不去积极收购，因而形成严重的滞销现象。一九五四年十二月上、中旬每天上市量达十多万斤，有时达二十万斤，国营和合作社营的收购单位每天只收一两万斤；有些果农把果子运到市场上，四、五天也卖不脱。由于大量的果子得不到及时收购，以致价格不断下降，原定特等果子每斤五百五十元，现在已经跌到三百元，因而引起了果农的普遍不满。
    中共金堂县委会发觉这个问题后，就及时向温江地委、温江专区财委、专区合作社办事处等有关机关反映，并请示解决办法。有关单位的回答是：这个问题要省农林厅、省合作总社才有权采取决定性的措施。县委又请示省总社、省农林厅，他们却回答说，要服从计划，不能大量收购。原来国营和合作社营的收购单位，收购广柑和橘子的计划订小了，目前广柑和橘子大量上市，他们又不肯变更这个计划。在这样的情况下，中共温江地委指示各地说服果农用贮藏的办法把销不出去的果子暂时贮藏起来，缓和一下市场上的严重滞销情况。地委的措施当然是对的，但是，合作社方面不从实际情况出发，机械地要服从计划，这是我想不通的。据了解，成都市合作社联合社、成都食品公司、专区贸易公司三个单位所订的水果收购计划还不到产量的
  一半。这样的计划不是显得很保守吗？为什么坚持保守的计划而不肯变更呢？
    随着人民生活水平的提高，人民对广柑和橘子等水果的需要量是不断增长的，金堂县的党、政领导方面曾说服教育农民安心地发展果树生产，但国营商业和合作社系统却偏偏不肯积极收购，这样怎能提高果农的生产积极性呢？
