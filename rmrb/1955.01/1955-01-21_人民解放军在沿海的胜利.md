    The People's Liberation Army's Victory on the Coast
    Our People's Liberation Army land, sea, and air forces on the Zhejiang front, in close coordination, liberated the outer stronghold of the enemy, Yijiangshan Island, in less than two hours on January 18, completely annihilating the Chiang bandit troops entrenched on the island, killing more than 500 enemy soldiers, capturing more than 550, and seizing a large amount of military supplies and other equipment. On the 19th, our army on the Guangdong front shot down and damaged eight enemy planes. These victorious news items are inspiring the broad masses of the Chinese people. People believe that this is a new victory for the People's Liberation Army in the struggle to liberate our sacred territory of Taiwan.
    The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, under the direction of the American imperialists, concluded a so-called "mutual defense treaty" and intensified war activities in an attempt to obstruct our people from exercising their national sovereignty. Facts have proved that this is only the enemy's fantasy. In order to liberate Taiwan and safeguard peace, our People's Liberation Army has continuously and relentlessly shelled and bombed the Chiang bandit troop positions entrenched on islands such as Dachen, Kinmen, and Yijiangshan, inflicting constant casualties on the Chiang bandits. Our heroic air defense forces have also dealt a heavy blow to the Chiang bandit air force that harassed the mainland. In the one-month period from September 3 to October 13 last year, sixty-two Chiang bandit planes of various types were shot down or damaged. Following the heroic People's Navy sinking one of the mainstays of the Chiang bandit navy, the escort destroyer "Taiping," on January 10 this year, our heroic People's Air Force again bombarded Dachen Port in turn, destroying and damaging four enemy ships. On the evening of the same day, our People's Navy sank the Chiang bandit gunboat "Dongting." Now, the liberation of Yijiangshan Island has further deprived the Chiang bandits of a springboard for carrying out pirate activities and deploying attacks on the mainland.
    These successive victories are obviously of great significance for further liberating the coastal islands and finally liberating Taiwan; they are also of great significance for protecting overseas trade, developing maritime transportation, and protecting the socialist construction of the motherland. These successive victories not only demonstrate the unshakable determination of our 600 million people to liberate their sacred territory of Taiwan, but also demonstrate that the strength of our People's Liberation Army in conducting modern joint land, sea, and air operations has been greatly enhanced. These victories will greatly inspire the enthusiasm of our people in carrying out socialist construction and the confidence in victory in liberating Taiwan. We extend our warm congratulations and greetings to the heroic units of the People's Liberation Army who have achieved these victories. At the same time, we express our sincere respect for the heroic spirit and hard work of the coastal people in cooperating with the People's Liberation Army in combat.
    On the road of advancing towards victory, we must also maintain a high degree of vigilance. We must see that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and its supporters, after suffering successive blows, are on the one hand very panicked, and on the other hand are struggling more frantically in an attempt to save their fate of final demise. According to foreign news agency reports, after the Chiang bandit clique signed the so-called "mutual defense treaty" with the American aggression group, the United States has stepped up the transportation of modern sea and air equipment such as jet aircraft, torpedo boats, and destroyers to Taiwan. The "American advisory group" stationed in Taiwan will also be expanded to more than 1,000 people to intensify the training of bandit troops and strengthen bandit troop equipment. Therefore, liberating the coastal islands and finally liberating Taiwan is still a serious struggle task for our military and civilians. The People's Liberation Army must work hard to strengthen its work, strive to train, overcome arrogance and impetuosity, and constantly improve its tactical and technical level. The land, sea, and air forces of the People's Liberation Army on the coast must, on the basis of the victories already achieved, further carry forward the spirit of patriotism and revolutionary heroism, actively fight, constantly strive for new victories, continue to inflict heavier blows on the Chiang bandit troops, and resolutely struggle to completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, liberate the coastal islands, and finally liberate Taiwan.
    The people of the whole country should, under the inspiration of the continuous victories of the People's Liberation Army, further develop the struggle to support the liberation of Taiwan. Recently, some rural areas and industrial and mining enterprises in Liaoning, Jilin, and Fujian provinces have turned the movement to support the liberation of Taiwan into a competition movement to over fulfill production plans. All regions and departments across the country should also universally transform the determination to liberate Taiwan into concrete and active actions, giving the People's Liberation Army material and spiritual assistance in all aspects, so as to strengthen the strength of the troops and ensure the victory of the operations.
    The people of the coastal provinces have a particularly important and glorious task in the struggle to liberate Taiwan. In addition to having to undertake more support for the frontline work, they must also raise their vigilance a hundredfold, be ready at all times to smash the Chiang bandit troops' small-scale harassment, looting and sabotage, eliminate special agent activities, consolidate the revolutionary order and social security in the coastal areas, so that the people can work in peace and the troops can carry out operations more smoothly.
    The people of the whole country should work together to strengthen all aspects of work, support the heroic battles of the People's Liberation Army, and strive to smash the US-Chiang war treaty, completely eliminate the heinous Chiang Kai-shek traitor, liberate the coastal islands, and finally liberate Taiwan! Victory belongs to us!

### 人民解放军在沿海的胜利

    人民解放军在沿海的胜利
    我浙江前线人民解放军陆海空军部队密切配合，于一月十八日以不到两小时的时间解放了大陈岛敌人的外围据点一江山岛，全歼盘踞该岛的蒋贼军，计毙敌五百多名，俘敌五百五十多名，缴获军用品及其他装备甚多。十九日广东前线我军击落击伤了敌机八架。这些胜利的消息鼓舞着我国广大的人民。人们都认为这是人民解放军在为解放我国神圣的领土台湾的斗争中的新胜利。
    蒋介石卖国集团在美帝国主义者的指使下，订立了的所谓“共同防御条约”，加紧了战争的活动，企图阻挠我国人民行使自己的国家主权。事实证明，这只是敌人的幻想。我国人民解放军为了解放台湾、保卫和平，连续不断地向盘踞大陈、金门、一江山等岛屿的蒋贼军阵地作了猛烈的炮击和轰炸，给蒋贼军以不断的杀伤；我英勇的防空部队也给骚扰大陆的蒋贼空军以重大的打击。从去年九月三日到十月十三日的一个多月中，就击落击伤蒋贼各型飞机六十二架。继英勇的人民海军击沉蒋贼海军主力之一——“太平号”护航驱逐舰以后，今年一月十日，我英勇的人民空军又轮番猛炸大陈港，毁伤敌舰四艘，同日晚我人民海军又击沉蒋贼炮舰“洞庭号”。现在一江山岛的解放，更使蒋贼失去了一个赖以进行海盗活动和部署进攻大陆的跳板。
    这些连续的胜利，对于进一步解放沿海岛屿和最后解放台湾显然具有重要意义；对于保护海外贸易，发展海上航运，保护祖国社会主义建设同样也有重要意义。这些连续的胜利，不仅表明了我国六亿人民解放自己神圣领土台湾的不可动摇的坚定意志，同时也表明了我国人民解放军进行现代化陆海空军联合作战的力量是大大增强了。这些胜利将大大鼓舞我国人民进行社会主义建设的热情和解放台湾的胜利信心。我们谨向取得这些胜利的英勇的人民解放军各部队致以热烈的祝贺和慰问。同时，我们对于沿海人民在配合解放军作战中的英勇精神和辛勤努力，表示亲切的敬意。
    在胜利前进的道路上，我们还必须保持高度的警惕。我们必须看到，蒋介石卖国集团和它的支持者在遭到连续的打击以后，一方面非常慌乱，一方面也更加疯狂地进行挣扎，企图挽救它最后灭亡的命运。根据外国通讯社的报道，在蒋贼集团同美国侵略集团签订了所谓“共同防御条约”以后，美国已加紧把喷气式飞机、鱼雷艇、驱逐舰等现代海空装备运到台湾。驻在台湾的“美国顾问团”也将扩大到一千多人，加紧训练贼军，加强贼军装备。因此，解放沿海岛屿和最后解放台湾，仍然是我国军民的严重斗争任务。人民解放军必须努力加强工作，努力训练，戒骄戒躁，不断地提高自己的战术和技术水平。人民解放军在沿海的陆海空军部队，必须在已经取得的胜利的基础上，更高度地发扬爱国主义和革命英雄主义精神，积极作战，不断地争取新的胜利，继续给蒋贼军以更加沉重的打击，为彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团，解放沿海岛屿和最后解放台湾而坚决斗争。
    全国人民都应该在人民解放军连续胜利的鼓舞下，把支援解放台湾的斗争进一步开展起来。最近一个时期辽宁、吉林和福建等省的一些农村和工矿企业，已经把支援解放台湾的运动变成了超额完成增产计划的竞赛运动。全国各地区和各部门，也应该把解放台湾的决心普遍地变成具体的积极行动，给人民解放军以各方面的物质援助和精神援助，以加强部队的力量，保证作战的胜利。
    沿海各省人民在解放台湾的斗争中负有特殊重要的光荣任务。他们除了必须担负更多的支援前线的工作以外，还必须百倍地提高警惕，随时准备粉碎蒋贼军的小股袭扰和掠夺破坏，肃清特务活动，巩固沿海地区的革命秩序和社会治安，使人民能安心生产建设，使部队能更加顺利地进行作战。
    全国人民应一致努力加强各方面的工作，支援人民解放军的英勇战斗，为粉碎美蒋战争条约、彻底消灭万恶的蒋介石卖国贼、解放沿海岛屿和最后解放台湾而努力奋斗吧！胜利是属于我们的！
