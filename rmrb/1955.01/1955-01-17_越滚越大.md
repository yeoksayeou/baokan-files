    Rolling Bigger and Bigger
    Han Chuan
    The report meeting had not yet started. A state-owned Peking Opera troupe actor and a state-owned drama troupe actor were chatting idly in the lounge:

    Peking Opera Actor (hereinafter referred to as "Peking"): "I haven't seen you on stage for a long time. Have you changed jobs?"

    Drama Actor (hereinafter referred to as "Drama") (shaking his head): "No. I've been working as an actor in the drama troupe."

    Peking: "Could it be like us: closing the door at home to improve our skills, and not performing anymore?"

    Drama: "To tell the story from the beginning, I have to borrow a line from your plays: 'It's a long story!'"

    Both laughed.

    Drama: "The normal ratio of male to female actors in a troupe is roughly three to one. But we're almost half and half, maybe even a few more female actors, so..."

    Peking: "Oh! That way, performing is very difficult. No wonder..."

    Drama: "No. What I'm talking about is the situation more than a year ago. Now it's changed several times. The troupe has studied it several times and asked the higher authorities to increase the number of male actors. The higher authorities are very concerned about us. As soon as they hear what difficulties we're complaining about, what 'business needs' we have, they..."

    Peking: "What?"

    Drama: "Approved our request to increase the staff."

    Peking: "Correct. But where do the people come from?"

    Drama: "Recruiting soldiers and buying horses is naturally much easier than streamlining the administration. Coincidentally, there was a troupe that was going to be disbanded..."

    Peking: "Very good, you can pick some male actors from that troupe."

    Drama: "It's not that simple. They said: either take the whole group; or don't take any."

    Peking: "Even if you take all the men and women, wouldn't the ratio remain the same?"

    Drama: "In order to absorb male actors, after several negotiations, we took over most of that troupe. Not only did the number of female actors increase again; there were also many male actors who didn't meet the requirements."

    Peking: "In that case, wouldn't there be idle staff in the troupe?"

    Drama: "Yes! We have a situation that is different from yours: whether your plays are revised or not, you have traditional repertoire anyway; we don't. We create, rehearse, and perform at the same time. So the troupe plans to add some more male actors, create more performance units, take turns rehearsing and performing, and take turns going down to experience life."

    Peking: "That's a good way, the theater can be performed regularly."

    Drama: "But, the administrative staff has increased even more. We now have a secretary section with twenty or so people. Can you imagine how great the style is? Besides, think about it: the number of actors has increased several times, if the stage staff doesn't increase, how can they handle it?"

    Peking: "Still increasing the staff?"

    Drama: "The band is also too small, and it must be developed accordingly."

    Peking: "Still increasing?"

    Drama: "The troupe that was merged originally had many female actors; some of the newly absorbed male actors and stage staff also brought their wives, who are also actors; what to do? We had to arrange them in the troupe as well, and the female actors 'naturally expanded' again, so we had to develop accordingly..."

    Peking (surprised): "Like this 'add water when there's too much flour, add flour when there's too much water', is there an end to it? The higher authorities probably won't approve!"

    Drama: "The higher authorities don't know how many people there are, so they can't stand the 'attack' from below, and the troupe is getting bigger and bigger like a snowball."

    Peking: "How many people do you have now?"

    Drama: "More than six hundred."

    Peking: "Oh! After all, we are a big country with a population of 600 million! We already thought we had a lot, you have more than two hundred more people than us."

    Drama: "The bigger the troupe, the more problems there are. With so many people, there is naturally less housing. Everyone goes to the general affairs section: 'Can't you see us living in the corridor!' 'You don't have a mass viewpoint!' '...' But, what can the general affairs section do!"

    Peking: "The housing problem is a big problem."

    Drama: "The housing problem, if the higher authorities approve, building several thousand square meters of basic construction would be easy to handle. What's difficult to handle is: with more actors, there are fewer performance opportunities. Some only play a mass role once a year, and only say one sentence; some don't perform a play for two years. Especially 'improving theater art', the directors simply push the young actors off the stage. Everyone is depressed, they make trouble, and later they criticize themselves and overcome their 'show-offism'; but there are some comrades whose thinking is stubbornly blocked: being an actor for a lifetime without going on stage, what kind of 'anonymous hero' is that? So some people want to change careers, some people want to go back to the local troupe to be a 'chicken head'.... Just at this time, the higher authorities proposed 'striving for artistic practice', and everyone supported it..."

    Peking: "Of course they support it!"

    Drama: "But, more than a year has passed, and still..."

    Peking: "One year has passed, and another year - our brother troupes, in a word: we are the same. Take me, this so-called middle-level actor, for example, I almost 'go through the motions' at home every day. Except for occasionally supporting a play once or twice, I can't hold the main role, and I'm too embarrassed to be sent to run errands often. When I'm idle, I lag behind and make trouble. We say this is 'bringing forth the new from the old' and 'pushing' us away, the leaders say it's for improvement. We just can't get out of this dead end: actors are separated from the audience, and they 'improve' at home behind closed doors. If we improve like this, we won't become famous actors, and if famous actors don't meet the audience, they will slowly become unknown. The higher authorities value us, they treat our cause as their own, and they almost give us as much money as we want. We have filled more than a dozen large rooms with costumes alone; it's just us - I dare not say we haven't done a good job, anyway we feel there is a problem..."

    Drama: "How have the audiences been recently?"

    Peking: "The audiences are terrible. Now..." Before he could finish his words, the electric bell rang, and it kept ringing, and the people listening to the report were all rushing to the conference hall, and the chat had to be interrupted, but they still had a lot to say, so they made an appointment for the continuation time:

    Peking: "Are you looking for me, or am I looking for you?"

    Drama: "Whoever looks for whom is fine."

    Peking: "Then, what day are you free?"

    Drama: "Except for eating and sleeping, as long as there is no meeting, I am free any day."

    越滚越大
    韩川
    报告会还没有开始。一位国营京剧团演员和一位国营话剧团演员在休息室里漫谈：
    京剧演员（以下简称“京”）：“很久在舞台上没有见到你。怎么，调换工作了？”
    话剧演员（以下简称“话”）（摇了摇头）：“没有。我一直在话剧团做演员。”
    京：“莫非跟我们一样：关着门在家里提高业务，戏也不演了？”
    话：“要从头说起，得借用你们一句台词：‘一言难尽哪’！”
    两人都笑了一笑。
    话：“一个剧团，男女演员的正常比例，大致上是三比一的样子。而我们差不多是一半对一半，说不定女演员还稍微多几个，所以……”
    京：“噢！这样，演出是很困难。怪不得……”
    话：“不。我说的这是一年多以前的情况。现在已经经过几次变化了。团里研究过几次，向上级要求增加些男演员。上级对我们倒是非常关心，一听下边吵吵什么困难啊，‘业务需要’啊，就……”
    京：“怎么样？”
    话：“批准了我们增加编制。”
    京：“正确。可是人从那里来呢？”
    话：“招兵买马，自然要比精兵简政容易得多。正巧，有一个剧团要撤销……”
    京：“很好，从那个团里可以挑选一些男演员。”
    话：“不那么简单。人家是：要就是全体；要就是一个也不给。”
    京：“连男带女都接过来，比例不是仍然不变么？”
    话：“为了吸收男演员，经过几次谈判，把那个团大部接了过来。不仅女演员又多起来；男演员也有不少不够条件的。”
    京：“这么一来，团里不就有闲员了么？”
    话：“是啊！我们有一种情况跟你们不同：你们的戏改也好，不改也好，反正有传统剧目；我们就没有。我们是边创作，边排练，边演出。所以团里就打算再增加些男演员，多搞几个演出单位，轮番着排练、演出，轮番着下去体验生活。”
    京：“这倒是个办法，剧场就能经常上演了。”
    话：“可是，行政人员加得更多。我们现在光是一个秘书科，就是二十来人。你瞧派头有多大？再说，你想想看：演员增加了几倍，舞台工作人员不增加，忙得过来忙不过来？”
    京：“还增加编制？”
    话：“乐队也太小，也必须相应发展。”
    京：“还增加？”
    话：“合并过来的剧团本来女演员也多；新吸收的男演员和舞台工作人员，有的又带着爱人，也是演戏的；怎么办呢？只好也安插到团里，女演员又‘自然膨胀’起来，于是又得相应地发展……”
    京（惊讶）：“像这样‘面多了加水、水多了加面’，还有个边儿没有呢？上级大概不会批准！”
    话：“上级心中无数，就吃不住下面‘进攻’，剧团就跟滚雪球一样越滚越大了。”
    京：“你们现在有多少人？”
    话：“六百多。”
    京：“哎哟！到底咱们是个六亿人口的大国！我们已经算得多了，你们比我们还多两百多人。”
    话：“剧团越滚越大，问题也越滚越多。人多自然房子就少。都去找总务科：‘看不见我们住在走廊里么！’‘你们没有群众观点！’‘……’可是，总务科有什么办法呢！”
    京：“房子问题是个大问题。”
    话：“房子问题，如果上级批准，搞几千平方米的基本建设，还好办。不好办的是：演员多了，演出的机会就少，有的一年只演一次群众角色，而且是只说一句话；有的两年不演一次戏。尤其是‘提高剧场艺术’，导演们就干脆把青年演员给推到舞台以外去。大家就苦闷，就闹情绪，后来自我批评，克服自己的‘风头主义’；但有一部分同志，思想硬是不通：当一辈子演员不上舞台，算是那一种类型的‘无名英雄’呢？于是就有人想改行，有人就想回到地方剧团里当‘鸡头’……。正在这时候，上级提出‘努力艺术实践’，大家都很拥护……”
    京：“当然拥护！”
    话：“可是，一年多过去了，依然……”
    京：“一年过去了，又是一年——咱们兄弟剧团，一句话：彼此，一样。就拿我这一号所谓中级演员来说，几乎每天在家里‘走过场’，除掉偶尔垫一、两次戏之外，既压不住大轴，跑龙套又不好意思常派我。闲来无事就落后闹意见。我们说这是‘推陈出新’把我们‘推’了，领导上说是为了提高。咱就是钻不出这个牛角尖：演员脱离了观众，关着门在家里‘提高’，提下去非名演员名不了，名演员不跟观众见面，慢慢也就不名了。上级重视我们，是拿我们的事业当事业办的，几乎是要多少钱就给多少，光服装我们就填满了十几个大房间；就是我们——我不敢说没办好，反正我们觉着有问题……”
    话：“近来上座上的怎么样？”京：“上座惨的很。现在……”没有等他的话说出来，电铃声响，而且是不停地响，听报告的人都向会议厅拥去，漫谈不得不被迫中断，可是他们的话还很多，所以就约会继续的时间：
    京：“是你找我呢，还是我找你？”
    话：“谁找谁也行。”
    京：“那么，你那一天有空？”
    话：“除去吃饭睡觉，只要不开会，哪一天都有空。”
