Xinhua News Agency, January 11th: Yang Yu, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the China Fisheries Association, hosted a banquet on the evening of the 11th to welcome the members of the Japanese-China Fisheries Agreement Council Fisheries Negotiation Delegation, who came to China to discuss Sino-Japanese fisheries issues.

The entire Japanese-China Fisheries Agreement Council Fisheries Negotiation Delegation, headed by Chief Delegate Suekichi Shichida, Deputy Chief Delegate Satataro Murayama, and Kinosuke Yamazaki, attended the banquet.

Also present were Gao Shuyi, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the China Fisheries Association, and advisors Zhao Anbo and others.

Japanese nationals in Beijing, Togo Kameda, Kazuo Suzuki, and Ganyouemon Nakamura, were also invited to the banquet.

The banquet proceeded in a friendly atmosphere.

Xinhua News Agency, January 11th: The Japanese-China Fisheries Agreement Council Fisheries Negotiation Delegation issued the following statement after arriving in Beijing:

We are representatives elected by the Japan-China Fisheries Agreement Council, composed of Japanese fisheries organizations and fisheries labor unions. Upon arriving in Beijing, we would first like to express our deep gratitude to your government and related organizations for their efforts in assisting Japanese nationals in returning to their country, returning Japanese fishing boats and crew members, and other undertakings beneficial to the friendship between Japan and China. In particular, when we think of Premier Zhou Enlai's remarks on the issue of Japanese independence and connect them with the mission of our delegation, we are all the more grateful.

We sincerely hope that through this meeting, we can improve the fisheries relations between Japan and China, so that the fishermen of both countries can safely fish in the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea.

Originally, such issues should be resolved through negotiations between countries. Unfortunately, China and Japan do not have diplomatic relations. However, as Premier Zhou Enlai said, if we use the lack of diplomatic relations as an excuse to ignore this issue, it will not only affect fisheries organizations but also affect future relations between the two countries, and may even become a major cause of harm to peace in Asia. Therefore, we sincerely hope to restore peace in the fishing areas as soon as possible. Our mission differs from economic and cultural exchanges and involves various difficult issues, but we firmly believe that if both parties can negotiate in good faith on the basis of mutual trust and friendship, we will be able to find common ground. At the same time, we would like to tell you that this meeting is not only a matter of concern to people in the fisheries industry, but also a matter of great concern, expectation, and hope for the entire Japanese nation.

    我国渔业协会筹委会欢宴日本渔业代表团
    日本渔业代表团发表声明希望改善日中两国渔业关系
    【新华社十一日讯】中国渔业协会筹备委员会主任杨煜，在十一日晚设宴欢迎来我国商谈关于中日渔业问题的日本日中渔业协议会渔业谈判代表团人员。
    以团长七田末吉、副团长村山佐太郎、山崎喜之助为首的日本日中渔业协议会渔业谈判代表团全体人员都应邀出席了宴会。
    出席作陪的有：中国渔业协会筹备委员会副主任高树颐，以及顾问赵安博等多人。
    在北京的日本人士龟田东伍、铃木一雄和中村玩右卫门等也应邀出席了宴会。
    宴会在友好的空气中进行。
    【新华社十一日讯】日本日中渔业协议会渔业谈判代表团到达北京以后发表声明如下：
    我们是由日本渔业团体、渔业工会团体组成的日中渔业协议会推选出来的代表。这次到了北京，首先我们要对贵国政府及有关各团体在协助在华日侨回国、送回日本渔船和船员以及其他有利于日中两国友好的事业上所作的努力表示深深的感谢。特别是当我们想到周恩来总理关于日本独立问题的谈话，并把它和我代表团的使命联系起来的时候，更是感激万分。
    我们衷心希望通过此次会谈，改善日中两国的渔业关系，使两国的渔业者能够安心地在东海、黄海捕鱼。
    本来此类问题应由国家和国家之间协商解决，可是遗憾的是中国和日本之间并无外交关系。但是正如周恩来总理所说，如果我们借口没有外交关系，而将此问题放任不管，那么不仅会影响渔业团体而且也会影响将来两国之间的关系，甚至会成为危害亚洲和平的主要原因。因此我们切望早日恢复渔区上的和平。我们的使命不同于经济、文化的交流，具有各种困难的问题，但是我们深信在相互信任、友好的基础上，双方能够善意协商的话，一定能够找出共同之点。同时我们愿意告诉你们，此次会谈不仅是渔业界人士所关心的问题，而且是全体日本国民都十分关心并加以期待和希望的问题。
                      日本渔业代表团
                      一九五五年一月十一日
