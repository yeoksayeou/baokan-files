    The Soviet Union Prepares to Commemorate the Fiftieth Anniversary of the First Russian Revolution
    [Our Newspaper Moscow Dispatch, Fourteenth] January 22nd marks the fiftieth anniversary of the First Russian Revolution. The working people of the Soviet Union are preparing to commemorate this glorious day. A large documentary exhibition commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the First Russian Revolution has been held at the National Public Library of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. In the section "The First Russian Revolution in Literature," works by Gorky, Mayakovsky, Novikov-Priboy, Kotsiubynsky, Rainis, and other writers are displayed. At the Kirov Palace of Culture in Leningrad, reports on the revolutionary events of 1905-1907 were held. Cultural palaces and workers' clubs are planning evenings and exhibitions on various topics about the struggle of the workers of St. Petersburg against Tsarist autocracy in 1905-1907. The Museum of the Revolution is preparing to hold an exhibition in several large halls of the Winter Palace. Many people in Leningrad participated in the events of 1905. On this memorable day, they will be discussing with young people the participation of the St. Petersburg proletariat in the First Russian Revolution.
    Note: The organizer and inspirer of the First Russian Revolution was the Russian Communist Party, created and nurtured by the great Lenin. The revolution of 1905-1907 was a bourgeois-democratic revolution. The purpose of the revolution was to overthrow the Tsarist autocracy, establish a democratic republic, establish an eight-hour working day, and confiscate the land of the landlords, eliminating landlord land ownership. The leader and basic driving force of the revolution was the proletariat; therefore, the peasants appeared in this revolution as the natural allies of the proletariat. In this revolution, the revolutionary struggles of workers and peasants were combined into a torrent for the first time.
    The Tsar ordered the army to shoot at a peaceful procession in St. Petersburg presenting a petition to the Tsar, triggering the revolution. The shooting of the peaceful procession discredited the Tsar and aroused the masses to engage in political struggle.
    The first revolution failed. One of the fundamental reasons for the failure was that a solid worker-peasant alliance had not yet been established. This revolution was the prelude to the October Revolution. It increased the experience of the working class and peasants in fighting against the autocratic system and convinced them that the Tsarist system was their mortal enemy. The broad masses of workers and peasants learned a practical lesson: only the working class, in alliance with the peasants, can overthrow the autocratic system and guarantee the victory of the people.

    苏联筹备纪念第一次俄国革命五十周年
    【本报莫斯科十四日电】一月二十二日是第一次俄国革命五十周年。苏联劳动人民正在筹备纪念第一次俄国革命的光荣日子。在乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国国立公共图书馆中举办了一个纪念第一次俄国革命五十周年的大的文献展览会。在“文学作品中的第一次俄国革命”这一部分，陈列有高尔基、马雅柯夫斯基、诺维科夫——普里波衣、卡秋宾斯基、莱尼斯和其他作家的著作。在列宁格勒的基洛夫文化宫中举办了关于一九零五年，一九零七年的革命事件的报告会。各文化宫和工人俱乐部都在筹划关于彼得堡工人在一九零五年——一九零七年进行反对沙皇专制制度的斗争的各种题目的晚会和展览会。革命博物馆准备在冬宫几个大厅中举办展览会。在列宁格勒有不少人参加过一九零五年的事件。在这值得纪念的日子里，他们将要和青年们座谈关于彼得堡的无产阶级参加第一次俄国革命的情况。
    按：第一次俄国革命的组织者和鼓舞者，是伟大的列宁所缔造和抚育起来的俄国共产党。一九零五年——一九零七年的革命，是资产阶级民主性质的革命。革命的目的是推翻沙皇专制制度，建立民主共和国，确立八小时工作制和没收地主的土地。消灭地主的土地占有权。革命的领导者和基本动力是无产阶级；因此，农民在这次革命中以无产阶级的天然同盟者的姿态出现。在这次革命中，工人和农民的革命斗争初次结合成一股巨流。
    沙皇命令军队在彼得堡枪击向沙皇呈递请愿书的和平游行行列，使革命爆发了。对和平游行行列的枪击，使沙皇的威信扫地，并使群众奋起进行政治斗争。
    第一次革命失败了。失败的根本原因之一，就是还没有建立起巩固的工农联盟。这次革命是十月革命的序幕，它使工人阶级和农民增加了同专制制度作斗争的经验，并使他们确信，沙皇制度是他们的死敌。广大的工人和农民群众受到了实际教训：只有工人阶级在和农民结成联盟的情况下，才能推翻专制制度和保证人民的胜利。
