    [This Newspaper's Despatch] People in various places are warmly supporting the issuance of the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds. Liu Tonggao, national model worker in the textile industry and delegate to the National People's Congress, was delighted when he saw the news in the newspaper that the state was going to issue the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds. Thinking of the achievements of the national economic construction over the past five years and the beautiful prospects of the motherland, he said happily: "If we save some money that can be saved to purchase bonds, we can accumulate a sum of funds for the country's socialist construction. This is really a great thing." Li Shiqin, a model seaman in Qingdao, Shandong Province, has already made a preliminary plan to subscribe for bonds. He said: "The increase in loading and unloading machinery and handling machines on the Qingdao wharf shows that our country is becoming more and more prosperous day by day. In order to accelerate the realization of the country's socialist industrialization, in addition to completing production tasks more actively, we should also pay attention to saving and use the surplus money to purchase bonds, so as to add bricks and tiles to the country's construction." Wu Renya, deputy director of the Ningjiang Yarn Factory, a local state-owned enterprise in Zhejiang Province, who visited the Anshan Iron and Steel Works technological innovation exhibition, said: "I was deeply moved to see the huge scale of Anshan Iron and Steel Works. However, building such a large industry as Anshan Iron and Steel Works requires the state to invest a large amount of funds. We should do our best to subscribe for bonds to support the country's socialist construction." The staff of the Qiaotou Street Office of the Taiyuan City Branch of the People's Bank of China registered to subscribe for more than 19 million yuan of bonds in the four days from the 22nd to the 25th of last month. On January 2, the Yangcheng Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qinyuan County, Shanxi Province, held a general meeting of all its members to discuss the significance of the state's issuance of bonds. In order to support the country's economic construction, the members subscribed for 4.1 million yuan of bonds at the meeting. On the day when the "Regulations on the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds" were promulgated, the Executive Committee of the Rehe Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce was holding a meeting. All the members unanimously adopted a resolution to support the state's issuance of the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds and called on industrial and commercial households in the province to actively subscribe for them. Zhu Mengsu, director of the Beiyang Yarn Factory, a joint state-private enterprise in Tianjin, and Yan Jinli, deputy director of the Inner Mongolia Federation of Industry and Commerce, both expressed their willingness to actively subscribe for bonds.
    At present, national economic construction bond promotion committees have been established in Beijing, Tianjin and other places. A wave of enthusiasm for subscribing for bonds is about to unfold.
