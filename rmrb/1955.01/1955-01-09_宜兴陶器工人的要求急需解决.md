To the Editors:

    The Dingshushan mining area in Yixing, Jiangsu, is the home of the famous Yixing pottery. However, the pottery production in this area suffers from a serious lack of responsibility. The rate of substandard and waste products in Yixing pottery has reached an alarming level. For each kiln of pottery fired, waste and substandard products often account for more than 30% of the kiln load, and sometimes even 60%. In terms of product inspection, there is a lack of strict regulations, and many substandard products are still being shipped to rural areas or factories. Users are complaining.
    The purple clay pottery produced in the Yixing Dingshushan kilns not only enjoys a certain reputation in the domestic market, but also holds a significant position in the international market. Among the workers who produce purple clay pottery, there are many highly skilled artisans. However, due to the lack of necessary work on their part, some famous arts such as carving, appliqué, shaping, color mixing, and mud, have either been lost or are on the verge of being lost. This is a matter that deserves attention.
    In the Dingshushan mining area, no one is responsible not only for technical exchanges, but also for the overall arrangement of pottery production, as well as the living welfare and cultural entertainment of pottery workers. There is neither a club nor a library here, only a cultural station that can accommodate a few people. We urgently need to improve our skills and production conditions, and we also urgently need normal extracurricular cultural activities. We hope that the relevant authorities will pay attention to Yixing's pottery production and quickly reverse this phenomenon of no one taking responsibility.

    An Investigation by Our Newspaper Reporter

    The pottery produced in the Dingshushan area of Yixing has a history of thousands of years. Since liberation, due to the increased purchasing power of the countryside, coupled with the large demand for pottery from the chemical, electrical, and construction industries in recent years, the production of pottery has been in short supply year after year. Moreover, the low output and poor quality are indeed the main problems in pottery production in this area today. Last autumn, a kiln in Dingshuzhen fired 800 pieces, and the number of substandard and waste products was 500, indicating that the waste rate has reached a very serious level.
    Why hasn't the output and quality of pottery produced in the Dingshushan area been improved? According to Comrade Jiang Jifen, Secretary of the Yixing County Party Committee:
    "There are so many things to do! But there are no cadres! Now, we can only send a few people to maintain the situation and hope that nothing goes wrong; that's the biggest wish." The cadres of the Dingshu district said: "The pottery clay of Dingshushan has been used for nearly a thousand years, but how much pottery clay is actually stored has never been surveyed." Indeed, it is difficult for Yixing County to manage this mining area well.
    Yixing pottery is all produced by hand. Among the handicraft workers, some are skilled, while others are very unskilled. To improve quality and increase output, it is necessary to organize technical training well. However, no unit has seriously considered this work in the five years since liberation. To this day, technical conservatism and unwillingness to take on apprentices are still very serious. For example, Liu Fuzhao, a technician who makes glazed tiles and shapes animal head roof ridges, has more than 20 years of experience in making them, but no one has ever paid attention to spreading his skills. Another example is Ren Ganting, a carving artist who makes purple clay teapots. He began learning carving at the age of ten and is now sixty-six years old. He has superb carving skills, and his carved works are lifelike. He is an artist with considerable artistic accomplishment, but unfortunately, there has been no planned organization to learn from him. It is said that Dingshushan originally produced a jujube-red purple clay (a product made with special technology, which was once popular at home and abroad), but because the worker who mixed the ingredients did not pass on his skills to future generations, no one can now manufacture this product.
    There are 25,000 citizens living in Dingshuzhen, of whom more than 7,000 workers are directly involved in pottery production. Together with the farmers who serve the pottery industry nearby, there are more than 40,000 people in total. The workers and farmers wrote to the Yixing branch of Xinhua Bookstore, requesting them to set up a bookstall in the town, but Xinhua Bookstore has not responded. The trade union in the Dingshushan area requested the allocation of 200 million yuan from the trade union's cultural and educational expenses to build a club, but the higher-level trade union has not approved it. Because no one leads cultural and recreational activities locally, some workers go to play far away. For example, in October last year, hundreds of workers chartered cars and ships to stay in hotels and watch operas in Yixing City, which is thirty miles away, and the round trip took four or five days, wasting no less than several thousand work hours.
    In fact, there are still examples of small-scale exchanges of experience and organized learning in the Dingshushan area, which have reduced the rate of substandard products. For example, after the Tangdu Township Pottery Production Cooperative carried out a series of production reforms, the rate of substandard products was reduced from 35% to 7%. It is precisely because the entire pottery production area is unattended that these good experiences have not attracted attention and been promoted.
    Based on the above situation, it is imperative to strengthen the leadership of Yixing pottery production. It is hoped that the relevant leaders will put this issue on the agenda, help Yixing pottery workers establish a technical promotion committee as soon as possible, promptly disseminate technical experience in pottery production, cultivate technical talents, and enable the production of Yixing pottery to meet the needs of the increasingly prosperous urban and rural markets. As for the cultural and recreational life of employees, it should be gradually resolved under the spirit of high concern for the lives of employees and according to possible conditions.

### 宜兴陶器工人的要求急需解决

    宜兴陶器工人的要求急需解决编辑同志：
    江苏宜兴鼎蜀山矿区，是驰名中外的宜兴陶器产地。但是，这个地区的陶器生产，却存在着严重的无人负责现象。目前宜兴陶器中的次废品率已经达到惊人的程度，每烧一窑陶器，废品和次货，往往要占到装窑数的百分之三十以上，有的甚至达到百分之六十。在货品的检验方面，缺乏严格的制度，好多不合规格的产品，仍然被运送到农村或工厂去了。用户纷纷埋怨。
    宜兴鼎蜀山窑场所出产的紫砂陶器，不仅在国内市场有一定的信誉，就是在国际市场上也是很有地位的。生产紫砂器皿的工人中，有不少是技术高超的艺人，由于没有人对他们进行必要的工作，因而有名的雕刻、贴画、塑造、调色和泥等艺术，有的已经失传，有的即将失传，这是一件值得注意的事。
    鼎蜀山矿区，不仅在技术交流方面无人负责，而且在整个陶器生产的安排，以及陶器工人的生活福利、文化娱乐等方面，也无人过问。这里，既没有俱乐部，又没有图书馆，只有一个容纳几个人的文化站。我们迫切地要求提高技术，改进生产状况，也迫切地要求有正常的业余文化活动，我们希望有关方面，重视宜兴的陶器生产，迅速扭转这种无人负责现象。

    宜兴鼎蜀山地区出产的陶器，相传已有千年的历史。解放以后，由于农村购买力的提高，加上近年来化学工业、电气工业和建筑业需用大量的陶器，陶器的生产常年是供不应求的；而且产量低、质量也差，这确是当前这一地区陶器生产中的主要问题。去年秋天鼎蜀镇有一处窑烧八百件货，结果次废品就有五百件，可见废品率已经发展到十分严重的地步了。
    鼎蜀山地区出产的陶器产量质量为什么得不到提高呢？据中共宜兴县委书记蒋继奋同志表示：
  “要做的事情多呢！可是，没有干部呀！现在，只好随便派几个人维持一下局面，不出乱子这就是最大的愿望了。”鼎蜀区的干部说：鼎蜀山的陶土已经采用近千年了，如今究竟还储存多少陶土，从来没有勘察过。的确，要求宜兴县来管好这个矿区是有困难的。
    宜兴陶器全部是手工生产，手工业工人中有技术熟练的，也有技术很差的，要提高质量、增加产量，就必须很好地组织技术传授；然而这一项工作，解放五年来没有那一个单位认真考虑过。至今技术上的保守、不肯带徒工的情况仍然十分严重。如制作琉璃瓦、塑造兽头屋脊的技工刘福兆，他有二十多年的制作经验，但一向就没有人去注意传播他的技术。又如制作紫砂茶壶的雕刻艺人任淦庭，十来岁就学习雕刻，至今六十六岁了，他有精湛的刻画技术，所雕刻的作品，神情活现，这是一位有相当艺术素养的艺人，可惜到现在还没有有计划地组织人向他学习。据说，鼎蜀山原来出产一种枣红色的紫砂（这是用特种技术配制而成的产品，曾经风行国内外），但由于这个配料工人没有把他的技术传给后人，现在已没有一个人会制造这种产品。
    在鼎蜀镇聚居了二万五千市民，其中直接参加陶器生产的工人在七千人以上，加上附近为陶业生产服务的农民，共计有四万多人。工人、农民们曾写信给新华书店宜兴支店，要求他们在这个镇上建立一个书摊，新华书店却一直没有答复。鼎蜀山地区的工会，要求在工会文教费用项目内支拨两亿元，修建一座俱乐部，上级工会却一直不予批准。由于当地没有人领导文娱活动，有些工人就跑到远处去游玩。如去年十月间，有数百工人包了汽车、轮船，到三十里以外的宜兴城住旅馆看戏，一来一往就是四、五天，浪费的工时不下数千个。
    其实在鼎蜀山地区以小单位交流经验、组织学习，因而减少次废品率的例子还是有的。如汤渡乡陶业生产合作社，在开展了一系列的生产改革以后，次废品率由百分之三十五降低到百分之七。正由于整个陶业产地，存在着无人负责现象，这些点滴的好的经验，也就没有引起注意和推广。
    根据上述情况，迅速加强宜兴陶器生产的领导工作，是一件刻不容缓的事。希望有关领导方面把这个问题放到议程上去，帮助宜兴陶器工人尽早成立技术推广委员会，及时传播陶业生产中的技术经验，培养技术人材，使宜兴陶器的生产得以满足日渐繁荣的城乡市场需要。至于职工的文娱生活，应在高度关心职工生活的精神下，根据可能的条件逐步予以解决。
