    Winter sports activities in Xining City, Qinghai Province, are more active this year than in previous years. Currently, factories, schools, and government offices in Xining City universally maintain morning exercises and work break exercises, and frequently hold basketball, volleyball, and table tennis, badminton competitions. On the People's Ice Rink, many people skate every day. Students of Mongolian, Tibetan, Hui, Tu, and Kazakh ethnicities from Qinghai Provincial Nationalities School often travel from seven or eight *li* away to the People's Ice Rink to skate on Sundays. The Qinghai Provincial Sports Commission held the first Xining City Ice Skating Games in late December last year. Mongolian youths Gengdeng and Taxin, who were first exposed to skating when they visited the first Northwest Regional Ice Sports Conference in 1953, both received medals for their excellent performance at this sports event.

    Currently, the Qinghai Provincial Sports Commission is renovating the People's Ice Rink and the illuminated basketball court, and is organizing factories, government offices, and schools to hold skating and ball game competitions during the Spring Festival. (Xinhua News Agency)

    西宁市冬季体育活动活跃
    青海省西宁市冬季体育活动比往年更活跃。目前西宁市各工厂、学校、机关中普遍坚持早操和工间操，并经常举行篮、排球和乒乓、羽毛球等比赛。在人民冰场上，每天有很多人滑冰。青海省民族公学的蒙、藏、回、土、哈萨克等民族的学生，星期日也常从七、八里路外赶来人民冰场滑冰。青海省体育运动委员会在去年十二月下旬举办了西宁市首届滑冰运动会。参加比赛的蒙古族青年更登、他日新在一九五三年参观西北区首届冰上运动大会时，还是第一次见到滑冰，可是在这次运动会上，他们都因成绩优良得到了奖章。
