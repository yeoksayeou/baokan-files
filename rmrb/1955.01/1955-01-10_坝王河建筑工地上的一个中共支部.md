A CCP Branch on the Bawang River Construction Site

The largest bridge on the Ji (Ning) Er (Lian) line—the Bawang River Bridge—has been completed. The construction of the Bawang River bridge piers began in March 1954, before the river ice had melted. Workers used the frozen ground to dig pits and build the bridge pier foundations. Just as the bridge pier foundations were being built, using cement and stone, the ice on the Bawang River melted, and the surging river water submerged the entire bridge pier construction project. The Party branch of the first detachment of the bridge construction team immediately held an emergency meeting. At the meeting, Party branch member Jing Zihe proposed a suggestion: using red soil-filled sacks to build cofferdams around the bridge pier construction site could block the intrusion of the icy water. After discussion, the Party branch adopted this suggestion and mobilized the masses to implement it together. Hundreds and thousands of sacks filled with red soil appeared around the bridge pier construction site. The icy water was blocked, ensuring the continuation of the bridge pier construction.

In July, the Bawang River experienced the largest flood peak in its history. The floodwaters exceeded the designed elevation, and the waves swept away the timber, steel rails, and bulldozers used for bridge construction, carrying them downstream into the river's center. The Party branch immediately mobilized Communist Party members, Youth League members, and workers to go into the water to rescue the materials. At this time, Communist Party member Duan Lianxiao took the lead in jumping into the river, and many workers followed suit. They fought the flood for a whole day, rescuing various construction materials worth over 100 million yuan.

However, the scaffolding for building the bridge piers was washed away by the flood, and the installed machine-powered winch also had an accident. It looked like construction was about to come to a standstill. Party branch secretary Li Zuoliang, based on the instructions of the higher-level Party committee and the suggestion of technical worker Li Yusheng, immediately convened an enlarged meeting of the Party branch with the participation of technical workers to discuss Li Yusheng's proposal to manufacture a manual winch to replace the machine-powered winch. This idea was widely discussed among the masses and received the support of Party members and workers. All the workers immediately started manufacturing the manual winch, ensuring the continuation of construction.

The Party branch of the first detachment of the Bawang River bridge construction team also improved safety equipment based on the opinions of the masses and the suggestions of worker model Zhuang Shangcai, ensuring the safety of workers performing high-altitude operations and improving construction efficiency.

    坝王河建筑工地上的一个中共支部
    新华社记者　廖由濯
    集（宁）二（连）线上的最大的一座桥梁——坝王河桥架桥完工了。修筑坝王河桥墩的工程，是在一九五四年冰河未化的三月开工的，工人们利用冻结掘坑砌筑桥墩基础。正当筑桥墩基础打洋灰、砌石时，坝王河的冰融化了，汹涌而来的河水把砌筑桥墩的全部工程淹没了。桥工队第一分队党支部当即召开了紧急会议，会上，党支部委员荆子和提出了一个建议：在桥墩施工的周围，用麻袋装红土作围堰，就可挡住冰水的浸入。党支部经过讨论，采纳了这个意见，并发动群众共同来执行。在桥墩施工的周围，出现了成百上千条装满了红土的麻袋，冰水被挡住了，保证了桥墩继续施工。
    到七月间，坝王河暴发了有史以来的第一次洪峰，洪水超过了设计标高，水浪把修桥用的木材、钢轨、推土车都卷入河心顺流而下。党支部立即发动共产党员、青年团员和工人下水抢救。这时，共产党员段连孝带头跳进了河中，很多工人也都相继跳下水去，他们和洪水搏斗了整整一天，抢救出价值一亿多元的各种施工器材。
    可是，修筑桥墩的脚手架被洪水冲走了，安装的机器动力绞车也发生了事故，眼看施工要停滞了。党支部书记李作良根据上级党委的指示和技术工人李玉生的建议，马上召开了有技术工人参加的支部扩大会议，讨论李玉生提出的制造人力绞车来代替机器动力绞车的建议，并把这个意见在群众中组织了广泛的讨论，得到党员和工人们的拥护和支持。全体工人马上动手制造人力绞车，保证了施工继续进行。
    坝王河桥工队第一分队的党支部还根据群众的意见，和工人劳动模范庄尚才提出的建议，改进了安全设备，保证了工人们进行高空作业时的安全，提高了施工效率。
