Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th: According to Hong Kong newspapers: The meeting of the Trade Subcommittee of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East opened in Hong Kong on the 6th.

　　The head of the Soviet delegation, Spandaryan, suggested at the meeting that representatives of the Government of the People's Republic of China be invited to participate in the meeting and obtain their rightful legal status. He said that in developing trade and economic ties between countries in the Asian and Far Eastern region and countries with trade relations with China, the People's Republic of China holds an important position. It is known that the People's Republic of China has already concluded trade agreements with India, Indonesia, Burma, Ceylon, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit, and has trade relations with many other Asian and Far Eastern countries. Inviting representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate is beneficial to resolving the current issues of this meeting.

　　The head of the Philippine delegation, Agio, insisted that the Soviet delegation's proposal was not in accordance with the meeting's procedures. The temporary chairman of the meeting, the Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, Lokanazan, declared the Soviet representative's proposal to be out of order.

　　Following this, the head of the Soviet delegation, Spandaryan, made a brief statement at the meeting, saying: The Soviet delegation regrets that representatives of the People's Republic of China were not invited to the meeting. The Soviet delegation believes that the "representatives" of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang have no right to represent the Chinese people.

　　The head of the Indian delegation, Kochar, then spoke, saying that the Indian delegation supported the Soviet delegation's statement and believed that the participation of the People's Republic of China was important in the meeting. He said that the Indian delegation strongly felt that without the participation of representatives from the People's Republic of China, the meeting would be difficult to achieve ideal results.

    在联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会贸易小组委员会会议上
    苏联代表建议邀请我国代表参加会议
   【新华社广州八日电】据香港报纸消息：联合国亚洲与远东经济委员会贸易小组委员会会议六日在香港开幕。
    苏联代表团团长斯潘杰利安在会上建议邀请中华人民共和国政府的代表参加会议并取得应有的合法地位。他说，在发展亚洲及远东地区国家的和同对华贸易有关国家的贸易和经济联系中，中华人民共和国是具有其重要地位的，大家知道，中华人民共和国根据平等和互惠的原则，已经同印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、锡兰、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国缔结了贸易协定，并且和许多其他亚洲及远东国家发生了贸易关系。邀请中华人民共和国代表参加，是对解决这次会议当前的问题有利的。　
    菲律宾代表团团长阿吉奥硬说苏联代表团的建议不合会议程序。会议临时主席、亚洲与远东经济委员会执行秘书罗卡那赞宣布苏联代表的建议为不合程序。
    接着，苏联代表团团长斯潘杰利安在会上发表一项简短的声明说：苏联代表团对中华人民共和国的代表在会议中未被邀请表示遗憾，苏联代表团认为，蒋介石国民党的“代表”是无权代表中国人民的。
    印度代表团团长科查尔接着发言说，印度代表团支持苏联代表团的声明，并且认为：在会议中，中华人民共和国的参与是重要的。他说，印度代表团强烈地感觉到，没有中华人民共和国的代表参加，会议将难以获得理想的结果。
