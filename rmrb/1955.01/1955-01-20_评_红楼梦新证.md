Review of "New Evidence on the Dream of the Red Chamber"
    Li Xifan, Lan Ling

    Mr. Zhou Ruchang's "New Evidence on the Dream of the Red Chamber" (hereinafter referred to as "New Evidence"), since its publication in 1953, has sold three editions and has had a considerable impact on the public. In a certain sense of the study of the Dream of the Red Chamber, it is a book that runs parallel to Yu Pingbo's "Study of the Dream of the Red Chamber" recently. However, some people, when criticizing "New Evidence," often treat it as equivalent to Hu Shi's "Textual Research on the Dream of the Red Chamber" and Yu Pingbo's "Study of the Dream of the Red Chamber," and thus hastily dismiss "New Evidence" with an overly biased attitude. We believe that "New Evidence" is different from the latter two. In the 390,000 words of "New Evidence," the author has indeed put in considerable labor in textual research and has made some valuable achievements; however, in terms of viewpoints and methods, there are still very serious errors, and even the development of some traditional errors.

    As a work of textual research on issues related to the Dream of the Red Chamber, the author clearly stated his task in "Writing at the Beginning":

      "This is a book about the novel Dream of the Red Chamber and its author Cao Xueqin's material textual research book.
      Materials are just the things we need to use when studying a problem; textual research is just one step in the entire research process; neither is the ultimate goal in itself. Materials and textual research have their use and value in order to provide some more convenient conditions for further and more important work, and in order to lay a relatively solid foundation for that work. Therefore, when reading material textual research related to the Dream of the Red Chamber and Cao Xueqin, we must not forget our starting point, that is, for the further and more important work mentioned above—that is, for the criticism and evaluation of this novel and this writer." ("New Evidence" page 1) For this reason, it is necessary to evaluate the author's work from this aspect.

    Hu Shi and Yu Pingbo have both done textual research on the Dream of the Red Chamber. Hu Shi sang high his textual research is "historical textual research," "only recognizes the facts, only follows the evidence." He believes that the textual research work of the Dream of the Red Chamber, "only needs to be based on reliable versions and reliable materials, to determine who the author of this book is, the author's deeds and family history, the era of writing this book, what different versions this book has had, and how these versions came about. These questions are the proper scope of the textual research of the Dream of the Red Chamber." However, his achievements in this area are minimal. In addition to extending or explaining Hu Shi's conclusions, and adding a little "interesting" "textual research," Mr. Yu Pingbo himself has no original textual research achievements to speak of. The "New Evidence" is still the main work in providing relatively rich materials on the author and his family history in the textual research work of the Dream of the Red Chamber.

    Negating Hu Shi's "experimentalism" textual research method does not mean negating the necessity of textual research work. And "New Evidence" has indeed made some better achievements in this regard. Therefore, it is unjust and incorrect to take a completely dismissive attitude towards it. We believe that the textual research achievements of "New Evidence" can be summarized into the following three aspects. First, "New Evidence" has put forward many valuable materials on some specific political backgrounds before and after the emergence of the Dream of the Red Chamber, compared with past "Redologists." Although the author still has a one-sided and erroneous understanding of the "political background," some achievements may be made unconsciously. However, the presentation of these textual research materials does help us understand the content of the Dream of the Red Chamber. Through the "Historical Material Chronology" chapter, which is the most wasteful of ink, we can still learn to a certain extent about the internal struggles and intrigues of the ruling class from the political activities of some historical figures at that time, from Kangxi, Yongzheng to Qianlong for nearly a hundred years. From the official positions of the Cao family lineage, we can also see the political darkness of the Manchu ethnic enslavement. The Manchu rulers, especially Kangxi, in order to consolidate their rule and suppress and enslave the resistance of the Han people, his officials had hereditary privileges—the privilege of arbitrary, extravagant, and cruel exploitation in politics and economy. Cao Yin and Li Xu, when serving as weaving supervisors and salt commissioners of Lianghuai in the Jiangnan area, repeatedly requested "succession to seek compensation" because of the huge losses they had caused. This is of great significance for understanding the political darkness and the luxurious life of the aristocracy described in the Dream of the Red Chamber. From the materials of Kangxi's southern tour, it can be clearly seen how much pretext this "incorruptible emperor" gave to his ministers to cruelly exploit the people. Taking the "silver of the common people as if spending seawater" is precisely his "benevolent government."

    Second, "New Evidence" provides rich materials for the textual research of Cao Xueqin's family history and deeds. We deny the views of Hu Shi, Yu Pingbo, and even Zhou Ruchang on the "realism" and "autobiography" of the Dream of the Red Chamber, but it does not mean denying autobiographical novels, nor does it mean denying that Cao Xueqin summarized his life experiences in the Dream of the Red Chamber. There is a fundamental difference between autobiographical novels and the "autobiography" and "realism" understood by "Redologists." One is resolutely advocating artistic typical generalization, and the other is resolutely rejecting artistic typical generalization. Autobiographical novels are just a style of novels. Although they take the author's own life experiences as the main basis for creating novel images, they are still able to create brilliant types. Such as Gorky's autobiographical trilogy "Childhood," "In the World," "My Universities," and Ostrovsky's "How the Steel Was Tempered" are famous and brilliant realistic works. The so-called "autobiography" and "realism" say that the author has not made any selection and artistic generalization of the life phenomena he described (including his own and others'), and has not penetrated the author's understanding and evaluation of life, but only objectively and calmly recorded these phenomena. This is a thorough bourgeois naturalistic literary point of view. Starting from this, it can lead to various absurd conclusions.

      "New Evidence" can sort out Cao Xueqin's family history and deeds, especially the section from Cao Yin to Cao Xueqin. This is helpful for understanding the content of the aristocratic society and the life of the aristocratic family described in the Dream of the Red Chamber, as well as the influence of the author's experience on his creation. The more detailed textual research on the rise and fall of the Cao family, especially the textual research on the main era that marked the transition of this feudal family from prosperity to decline, that is, the era from Cao Yin to his son Cao Yong and Cao Fu, excluding some incorrect explanations mixed in it, only from the perspective of the materials, it has indeed narrated the life scene of the Cao family's "century of prosperity." This can help explain that it is not surprising that a great writer like Cao Xueqin can create a masterpiece reflecting the complex spiritual outlook of the entire era, the Dream of the Red Chamber, which indeed summarizes the environment in which the author lived and the family life.

    Third, the above problem inevitably leads to such a conclusion: Precisely because the author of the Dream of the Red Chamber had such life experiences, had the thoughts and feelings of the characters in the book, and had the same encounters and feelings, he was able to create tragic characters like Jia Baoyu and Lin Daiyu, depict the dark, hypocritical, and corrupt life truth of the feudal rulers, and the complete picture of the eve of the collapse of feudal society.

    However, affirming the achievements of "New Evidence" in textual research does not mean affirming the correctness of its views and methods. The errors in the views and methods of "New Evidence" not only hindered the author from correctly evaluating the realistic artistic achievements of the Dream of the Red Chamber, but also greatly hindered the author from making more achievements that should have been made. The reason is not only "due to the error in the understanding of realism," but fundamentally does not understand the true content of realism. Zhou Ruchang once said in his article "My View on Yu Pingbo's Erroneous Views on Studying the Dream of the Red Chamber": "If a young intellectual does not understand Marxism before liberation and comes into contact with the topic of the Dream of the Red Chamber, he will become a prisoner of Hu and Yu in terms of textual research methods. The author is an example. In my book 'New Evidence on the Dream of the Red Chamber,' I compare the characters in the novel with the Cao family lineage everywhere, saying that the dates in the novel coincide with the author's actual life, and saying that the novel is a 'carefully crafted life record,' which is the most prominent proof."

    It is very welcome that the author can initially recognize his mistakes. However, the errors of "New Evidence" are by no means simply as the author said, just "in the textual research method" "become prisoners of Hu and Yu."

    The entire textual research work of "New Evidence" is to achieve the "ultimate goal" of proving that the Dream of the Red Chamber is a "carefully crafted life record." In Hu Shi's words, it is to honestly describe this "sitting and eating the mountains and emptying" "trees falling and monkeys scattering" naturalistic work. In Yu Pingbo's words: "The means of the author of the Dream of the Red Chamber is sketching," "The author's attitude is just a mirror. When it comes to the front, the appearance must be fully revealed and there is no escape. Although the beauty and ugliness must be seen from the mirror, the mirror cannot be responsible for the reason for the beauty and ugliness." On the viewpoint of naturalistic "autobiography," "New Evidence" and Hu and Yu have reached a consensus, and the entire textual research work has developed this viewpoint. The only difference is that "New Evidence" has deleted the self-contradictory statements of the "New Redologists" and prominently emphasized the "autobiography" theory.

    When talking about the motivation for writing "New Evidence," Zhou Ruchang said, "It is not my goal to lead the research of the Dream of the Red Chamber from the combination with social politics to the separation from social politics; on the contrary, I want to strive to find the social and political significance of the Dream of the Red Chamber within the limited level of my own knowledge and theory, and to see the problem of the Dream of the Red Chamber more closely combined with social politics." Such a motivation is of course good. However, the Marxist attitude towards problems cannot simply believe in motivation without looking at his actual actions and the objective effects produced. Chairman Mao said, "To test whether the subjective wishes of a writer, that is, his motives, are correct and kind, is not to look at his declarations, but to look at the effects of his actions (mainly works) on the masses of society. Social practice and its effects are the criteria for testing subjective wishes or motives." According to such a standard, the content of "New Evidence" is checked, and the problem is relatively serious.

    We believe that the "New Evidence's" understanding of the so-called "social and political background" of writers and works is incorrect, at least one-sided in some aspects. Although the author mentioned in the "Introduction" that "the Qianlong dynasty was a major turning point in the collapse of the patriarchal family of thousands of years of feudal society, and prosperity bred danger"; however, he did not use the historical situation of the development of social politics, economy, and cultural system at that time to discuss and prove this judgment, as the real historical background for Cao Xueqin's creation, but only understood the social and political background as the Cao family's family history. To expand a little, the social and political background is simply attributed to the historical facts on the political arena of the internal strife of the ruling class. At the same time, the social and political significance of literary works does not mean that it mechanically reflects those historical events, but lies in what it reflects through artistic images, and what kind of social significance these artistic images have, that is, the tendency of literature. It can be seen from this that the author's understanding of the social and political background and the social significance of literature is wrong. Therefore, it can also be understood why he conducted so many cumbersome textual researches.

    The error in the "Character Examination" chapter lies in the fact that the author emphasized the combination of Cao and Jia more than Hu and Yu. When examining the Cao family's family history, he used the Jia family's family history described in the Dream of the Red Chamber to make up for its deficiencies; when examining the Jia family's family history, he moved back the Cao family's family history that had been examined to confirm it. As a result, except for a few with real historical evidence, most of them are speculative. Even as a family tree, the Cao family lineage listed in "New Evidence" is partly added to conform to the character list of the Dream of the Red Chamber, which does not conform to the actual situation. Although the purpose is to prove the correctness of the "realism" and "autobiography," as a result, due to unfounded subjective speculation, the "realism" and "autobiography" are objectively denied. When examining the lineage of a family, it can only be arranged according to actual materials, and no speculation can be added, let alone replace the characters that do not actually exist with "circles" and "dots." Although "New Evidence" lists two identical lineage tables in form, it actually does not respect objective facts at all. If you can arbitrarily delete and add to the "family tree," then you can also list many unrelated lineage tables with the same surname, and turn the world's "people" into one family.

    The most meaningless part of this chapter is the textual research on the Cao family's relatives. It is natural to involve the relatives related to his life when examining the environment in which Cao Xueqin lived, but the textual research of "New Evidence" in this regard is far away from the actual needs. Because Cao Xueqin's great-aunt married Gan Titan, a large number of Gan family's lineage tables, family trees, etc. are listed. According to the same method, the family history of Li, Fu Heng, Fu Peng, etc. are also listed, and the horizontal branches spread endlessly. But they have nothing to do with the Dream of the Red Chamber. In this way, even if the textual research is more detailed, it is just taking the opportunity of studying the Dream of the Red Chamber to sort out their family trees for them, and it is of no use to the Dream of the Red Chamber and helping readers understand Cao Xueqin and the Dream of the Red Chamber.

    Of course, this error is closely related to the view that the content of the Dream of the Red Chamber is understood as "carefully crafted life records." The harmful effect of this trivial textual research hinders readers' understanding of the essence of the character's personality in the Dream of the Red Chamber as an artistic image.

      The chapter "Native Place and Origin" is also far away from the textual research of the family history and deeds related to the author, and it goes back to the era of Cao Xueqin's ancestors. This is the specific manifestation of Zhou Ruchang's narrow understanding of the social and political background. He said in the "Introduction," "Cao Xueqin's ability to have the great achievement of this novel, literary talent cannot but be a factor, but we especially cannot ignore his extremely special environmental background: three rare combinations. First, his family's position is a combination of slaves and rulers. ... Second, his family is a combination of Han and Manchu. ... Third, his family has settled in Jiangnan for six or seventy years. When Cao Xueqin was born, he was no different from the local people in Jiangnan. This is another combination of northerners and southerners." It is obviously wrong to understand the social roots of Cao Xueqin's genius in this way on the surface. As a textual research of a fact, it is a pity that the author did not find any characteristics of the combination of Han and Manchu in this family that had already been Manchurianized. The conclusions of the two questions that the author tried to clarify are still possible speculations due to the lack of materials: that is, "Cao's ancestral home may be Fengrun," and the Cao family may be "Liaoshen border people who were captured as slaves."

    If the biggest common problem of the above two chapters is the cumbersome and irrelevant textual research, then in the chapter "Location Problems," it has completely gone to the realm of speculation. Although the author criticized the "certain street and certain lane school," he himself is still trying to find out where the Grand View Garden is in "certain street and certain lane." He even said harder, thinking that the Cao family had two houses in Beijing, one next to the Gongyuan in Dongcheng, and the other in the Huguosi area northwest of the Forbidden City, and further "very suspiciously Cao Xueqin's old house is the current Beijing Normal University Girls' College," and also believes that once the survey is confirmed, he will also suggest opening a "Cao Xueqin Memorial Hall" here. However, what the author relies on is only some vague materials, and most of them use the location of the artistic description of the Dream of the Red Chamber as the material for confirming the survey. The other so-called "vaguely Grand View Garden" and "Imaginary Map of Rongguo Mansion," although they also provide some clues for understanding Cao Xueqin's artistic description of Ning and Rong mansions, most of them still inherit the arbitrary imagination of "old Redologists." The conclusion is only to add the "carefully crafted life record" that the author wants to instill in readers.

    "Historical Material Chronology" is the most complex chapter of "New Evidence," with a total of 250 pages, accounting for more than one-third of the book. Starting from the third year of Chongzhen in the Ming Dynasty (1630) to the fifty-sixth year of Qianlong in the Qing Dynasty (1791), although there are some acceptable things in it (as affirmed above), most of them are excerpts from the poems, essays, county chronicles, and epitaphs of predecessors. There are very few real historical materials on politics, economy, and culture, especially in the era of Cao Xueqin. Therefore, it is impossible to better understand the impact of the era on Cao Xueqin's creation through this "Historical Material Chronology."

    In the chapter "New Interpretation," the author went to another wrong path. The "New Interpretation" has a total of seventy-five articles, and its views and methods have not taken a step beyond the old interpretation. Although some of the old interpretations are unfounded nonsense or far-fetched associations, the new interpretations are far-fetched attempts to prove that the Dream of the Red Chamber is both real and true, and even the time coincides with history. As for the description of poetry, words, and realms, it is similar to a certain poem and a certain word, the concept of "color" and "emptiness" comes from the Golden Lotus, Jia Lian and You Erjie's flirting comes from Liao Zhai, etc., and Yu Pingbo's understanding of "traditionality" has reached a consensus.

    The chapter "Cao Xueqin's Birth and Death and the Chronology of the Dream of the Red Chamber" is what the author considers "the most meaningful harvest," but in fact it is the peak of the author's erroneous views. The author "read the entire Dream of the Red Chamber, and extracted all the words of age, date, and season, compiled them into a chronology, and then matched the real dynasty years with the novel according to the birth and death years obtained by the above deduction," "As a result, the degree of conformity between the two is amazing," "From the time of Xueqin's birth to match Baoyu's birth, to Xueqin's thirteen years old, Baoyu in the book is exactly thirteen years old." Therefore, the author concluded: "Such a big book, with millions of words, characters and things, complex and varied, and the writing of the years, seasons, ages, and sizes are so consistent and orderly, which is really amazing!" For the textual research work of literary works to achieve such "success," the author could not help but happily think that "It can be seen that Cao Xueqin's novel was originally written in the form of a chronology, and Zhi Yanzhai also read it in the form of a chronology," so he claimed that his textual research work "just restored Xueqin's original intention."

    However, we believe that this cannot but be an extreme interpretation. A great realistic work naturally also requires the truth of details. The Dream of the Red Chamber is relatively prominent in this regard. The narration of things in the Dream of the Red Chamber follows the objective process of events, and is described in an orderly, reasonable, delicate, and meticulous manner. However, purposefully matching the author's own birth and death dates with the dates of the characters in the work, and taking subjective association methods everywhere, can not only make Cao Xueqin's birth and death dates match Jia Baoyu, but also match any character in the book, and even "conform to an amazing degree." The problem is not whether the two actually coincide objectively, but whether the author purposefully makes them coincide. Such a practice is just a kind of "playing around" with words, and cannot be regarded as real textual research.

    Through the above simple analysis of the main content of "New Evidence," it can be seen that the main error running through the entire book is not only that, as the author said, in "textual research methods," it has become a "prisoner of Hu and Yu," but in the viewpoint that it inherits and develops Hu and Yu's "realism" and "autobiography." The entire textual research work of "New Evidence" is carried out under the guidance of this viewpoint. The saying that the Dream of the Red Chamber is a "carefully crafted life record" is the starting point of the author's textual research work and the final conclusion. For this reason, it is believed that the description of characters, stories, plots, time, place, and even various life details, all have a factual basis. In this way, it is not difficult to understand what the true content of Cao Xueqin, who is praised by the author as China's "first-rate genius realistic writer," is.

    Zhou Ruchang believes that "New Evidence" "mainly wants to emphasize Mr. Lu Xun's 'realism' and 'autobiography,' and he seems to be a loyal believer and follower of Lu Xun. But on this issue, Lu Xun cannot defend the author. Lu Xun's basis for believing that the Dream of the Red Chamber is "realistic" and "autobiographical" in "A Brief History of Chinese Novels" is partly quoting Hu Shi and Yu Pingbo's statements, which is of course incorrect. However, Lu Xun's entire view is not completely the same as Hu Shi and Yu Pingbo's view. We respect Lu Xun, but we cannot even treat his erroneous statements as "the Bible." As a great ideological fighter, Lu Xun is not always like some people say, but has his own development path. He said in the preface to "Three Leisure Collections": "I have one thing to thank the Creation Society for, that is, they 'squeezed' me to read several scientific literary theories, and understood the questions that the previous literary historians said a lot, but still entangled. And because of this, I translated a book on art theory by Plekhanov to correct my—and because of me—biased belief in evolution."

    Lu Xun's thought when he wrote "A Brief History of Chinese Novels" from 1920 to 1923 was still the thought of evolution, and some views were not completely scientific, and he never regarded it as completely correct. Therefore, it is inappropriate for Zhou Ruchang to isolate and extract Lu Xun's early views on the Dream of the Red Chamber to defend his own views. Because Lu Xun later corrected his views with a more scientific understanding in "The Last Compilation of Qiejieting Essays." He said, "Because there are many people in the world who cannot enter novels. However, even if someone entirely enters a novel, if the author's skills are high and the work is passed down for a long time, what the reader sees is only the person in the book, and it has nothing to do with this person who once existed. For example, Jia Baoyu's model in the Dream of the Red Chamber is the author Cao Zhan himself, and Ma Erxiansheng's model in The Scholars is Feng Zhizhong. Now what we feel is only Jia Baoyu and Ma Erxiansheng. Only special scholars such as Mr. Hu Shih will remember Cao Zhan and Feng Zhizhong in their hearts: this is the so-called life is limited, but art is more permanent." (The emphasis is added by the author) Lu Xun sharply criticized Hu Shi's statement with such a scientific view of the typical creation of the Dream of the Red Chamber, and of course changed his view in "A Brief History of Chinese Novels."

    The author of "New Evidence" is good at textual research, why did he deliberately ignore Lu Xun's important words? Why not choose the correct scientific view from his entire theory of the Dream of the Red Chamber, but only grab a certain point to emphasize? "If there is a choice, it is not a whole person, and if there is more suppression and elevation, it is further away from the truth." Zhou Ruchang directly violated Lu Xun's scientific proposition of commenting on a classical writer here. The question is not difficult to answer. Rather than saying that Zhou Ruchang wants to confirm and develop Lu Xun's views on the Dream of the Red Chamber, it is better to say that he is using Lu Xun's words to advertise his textual research. It can be seen from this that since Lu Xun once partly quoted Hu and Yu's erroneous views, but later corrected them and published his own outstanding scientific new views, then what Zhou Ruchang tried to prove through textual research is fundamentally not Lu Xun's view, but precisely Hu and Yu's erroneous views. This subtle "traditional" relationship is fully sufficient to explain the origin and "traditionality" of Zhou Ruchang's erroneous views. Perhaps the result of this indirect reasoning and "textual research" will not be considered a "coincidence"?

    Starting from Lu Xun's correct view of the Dream of the Red Chamber in his later period, we can also get such an inspiration. The Dream of the Red Chamber does summarize some of Cao Xueqin's own personal experiences. However, once a great artist uses the means of artistic generalization to cast his life experience into the entire artistic image, those experiences are no longer a mechanical combination of a pile of factual truths, but affect the reader with the charm of the artistic image. Any "life record" that does not have artistic charm, even if it is "carefully crafted," is still just a record of life phenomena, and is by no means a literary work. In addition to using textual research to confirm that the Dream of the Red Chamber is "realistic" and "autobiographical," Zhou Ruchang also specifically moved out "Zhi Pi" as a basis for explaining the "realism" of the Dream of the Red Chamber, which is problematic. If we can correctly understand Lu Xun's view, then the problem of "Zhi Pi" can also be roughly given a reasonable and correct explanation.

    Regardless of whether Zhi Yanzhai is Cao Xueqin's "uncle," "uncle," or "Tangcun," "Shi Xiangyun," it can be affirmed that he is a person of the same time as Cao Xueqin. Zhi Yanzhai pointed out in the comments that some of the plots of the Dream of the Red Chamber are things that have happened, and even the commenter himself has personally experienced and participated in them. But this can only show that Cao Xueqin does summarize his life experience in the artistic image he created, and show that his creation has a deep life foundation, rather than fabricating out of thin air. However, it cannot be said that the Dream of the Red Chamber is a "carefully crafted life record" just because "Zhi Pi" says that certain details are "really true" or "the author and I have really experienced it." Zhi Yanzhai uses his understanding of Cao Xueqin and his own sentimental emotions to comment on the Dream of the Red Chamber. His valuable contribution is to provide some realistic life basis for the creation of the Dream of the Red Chamber. As a literary view, Zhi Yanzhai fundamentally cannot understand the social significance and ideological value of the Dream of the Red Chamber as a literary work, let alone understand that the Dream of the Red Chamber moves himself with vivid images that have been artistically generalized, touches his heart, and makes him "sour nose," "alas," "sad," and "cry." Zhi Yanzhai's general view of the Dream of the Red Chamber, from the point of view of literary criticism, is only and absolutely impossible to exceed the "autobiography." To borrow an inappropriate word, it is still a "naturalistic" literary view, which is of course not a bourgeois literary view. Therefore, to use Zhi Pi to help understand the Dream of the Red Chamber, if you do not get rid of the traditional "curse"-style worship of "Zhi Pi" kneeling to the ground, develop it, and raise it to the level of scientific literary theory, it is impossible to jump out of the quagmire of "realism," "autobiography," and "autobiography."

    The "New Redologists" and Zhou Ruchang are all believing in "Zhi Pi" with such an attitude, defending their naturalistic "sketch" theory, in order to deny the realistic achievements and true ideological value of the Dream of the Red Chamber.

    Precisely because Zhou Ruchang emphasized the "realism" of the Dream of the Red Chamber (this concept is no different from Hu Shi and Yu Pingbo's "realism" concept), he completely denied the last forty chapters of the Dream of the Red Chamber, cursed Gao E, and advocated "quickly cutting off his pseudo-forty chapters from the Dream of the Red Chamber and throwing them into the wastepaper basket, not allowing him to attach himself to the rumor, accusing his crimes to the readers all over the world, and avenging Cao Xueqin, the first-rate genius realistic writer who was wronged for more than one hundred and ten years!" This deep-seated hatred for the sequel author seriously affected his textual research work. He would rather pull some fundamentally unimportant details to test a possible pending case than be willing to spend a little bit of actual textual research effort to test Gao E, a writer who has made a lot of contributions to the Dream of the Red Chamber and is recognized by the people. Is Gao E not more valuable than Fu Heng, Nersu, Fu Peng, Gan and others? Obviously, Zhou Ruchang did not carry out textual research based on the scientific literary criticism point of view, but deliberately erased things that already have objective value in order to emphasize "realism" and "autobiography" with subjective prejudice.

    Of course, the ideological and artistic qualities of the last forty chapters of the Dream of the Red Chamber are far inferior to the first eighty chapters. If Cao Xueqin had finished the whole book, it would have been more successful and more loved by the majority of readers. However, the great genius Cao Xueqin did not have time to complete this masterpiece, and his precious life was taken away by the environment. However, the development trend of the tragic conflict in the first eighty chapters of the Dream of the Red Chamber is obvious, thus causing the uneasiness of the feudal cultural minions, and there are many people who add a dog's tail to the sequel. However, Gao E defended the realistic spirit of the Dream of the Red Chamber in this sense, developed the character's personality and tragic conflict in the book, and maintained the tragic ending, so it can be circulated in the masses together with the first eighty chapters, which is of great significance to the Dream of the Red Chamber. Zhou Ruchang abandoned the scientific point of view of literary criticism, and did not evaluate the last forty chapters of the sequel from the integrity of the artistic image, but only devalued it and denied it from the merits and demerits of individual words. This extremely biased attitude is very harmful to the Dream of the Red Chamber and the majority of readers. Yu Pingbo denied Gao E with the theory of "literary emotion," and Zhou Ruchang denied Gao E with the theory of "text," and the objective effects are completely consistent.

    "New Evidence" is right to emphasize the necessity of scientific textual research. After criticizing some of the erroneous textual research views and methods of "old Redologists," it seems that its own textual research is scientific textual research. However, through the above analysis, it can be seen how strongly this so-called "scientific textual research" is dominated by a kind of subjective domination. In fact, it has not jumped out of the camp of "experimentalism" textual research.

    "New Evidence" said when talking about the "Zhi Pi" in chapters 17 and 18, "If Hu Shi only believes that the scattered and fragmented places that we can research are realistic, and he erases the two chapters that Xueqin spent so much effort to write, if it is all like this, I feel very confused, where is the real place in a big book, where is the virtual place, what standard should be used to distinguish it? And how to determine whether there are more realistic places? Or are there more fictional places? If there are more fictional places than realistic places, then can Hu Shi's own claim of Xueqin's autobiography still be established? Can't it be established?"

    This long paragraph that mechanically divides the complete and typical art into the dualism of "virtual" and "real" on the one hand expresses the blame for Hu Shi's "autobiography" not being thorough, and on the other hand shows that his "autobiography" is thorough, "not allowing any doubt." "New Evidence" did practice its erroneous views with complete and unreserved textual research work, that is, it further inherited and developed Hu Shi's absurd points. In fact, it did not jump out of Hu Shi's trap. This is the basic crux of the serious errors in the views and methods of "New Evidence."

    Despite the serious errors in the views and methods of "New Evidence," as a book of textual research on the author of the Dream of the Red Chamber, there are still many acceptable things. At the same time, Zhou Ruchang, as a young academic researcher, must not be regarded as equal to Hu Shi and Yu Pingbo. The author is exploring new roads with hard work. Recently, the author is rewriting this book. We hope that the author can not only limit himself to the revision of individual details, but should further carry out a thorough change from the basic views and methods. This is the most fundamental problem and the key to success or failure. We also believe that if the author is willing to seriously study Marxism-Leninism with everyone, use the truth to arm himself, correct his past erroneous views, and start the scientific textual research work again under the guidance of the correct views and methods, he will surely rewrite the "New Evidence on the Dream of the Red Chamber" into a book that is truly more beneficial to readers and classical literature researchers in understanding Cao Xueqin and the Dream of the Red Chamber. This is the common expectation of many readers. Zhou Ruchang should not disappoint this sincere expectation of everyone in his own academic practice.

    评“红楼梦新证”
    李希凡　蓝翎
    周汝昌先生所著的“红楼梦新证”（以下简称“新证”），自一九五三年出版以来，到现在已经销行了三版，在群众中产生了相当大的影响。从红楼梦研究工作的某种意义上来说，它是最近和俞平伯的“红楼梦研究”相并行的一部书。然而有些人在批评到“新证”时，却往往把它和胡适的“红楼梦考证”、俞平伯的“红楼梦研究”同等对待，因而以过于偏激的态度，草率地将“新证”一笔抹杀。我们认为，“新证”是不同于后二者的。在三十九万字的“新证”里，作者在考证工作上确实付出了相当大的劳力，也作出了一些可贵的成绩；不过在观点和方法上，仍然存在着非常严重的错误，甚至发展了某些传统的错误。
    作为一部考证和红楼梦有关问题的著作，作者在“写在卷首”里，曾经明确地提出过自己的任务：
      “这是一本关于小说红楼梦和它的作者曹雪
  芹的材料考证书。
      材料不过是我们研究一个问题时需要取资的
  东西；考证也只是整个研究过程中的一个步骤；
  二者本身都不是最终目的。在为了给进一步的更
  重要的工作提供一些较为便利的条件上、在为了
  给那一工作打下一个比较结实的基础上，材料和
  考证才有它们的功用和价值。因此，在阅读有关
  红楼梦和曹雪芹的材料考证时，我们便不能忘掉
  我们的出发点，即为了上文所谓进一步的更重要
  的工作——那就是，为了这部小说和这位作家的
  批判与评价工作。”（“新证”页一）正因如此，所以也就必须从这方面来评价“新证”作者的工作。
    胡适、俞平伯都作过红楼梦的考证工作。胡适高唱他的考据是“历史的考据”，“只认得事实，只跟着证据走”。他认为红楼梦的考证工作，“只须根据可靠的版本与可靠的材料，考定这书的著者是谁，著者的事迹家世，著书的时代，这书曾有何种不同的本子，这些本子的来历如何，这些问题乃是红楼梦考证的正当范围。”但是，他在这方面所考证出的成绩，却是微乎其微。俞平伯先生除了引申或说明胡适的结论，并附带一点“趣味”的“考证”外，自己更无任何独创性的考证成绩可言。真正在红楼梦考证工作中，对作者及其家世提供出比较丰富的材料的，在目前来说，“新证”还是主要的一部著作。
    否定胡适的“实验主义”考证方法，绝不等于否定考证工作的必要性。而“新证”的确在这方面作出了一些较好的成绩。因此，对它采取一笔抹煞的态度，是不公正的，也是不正确的。我们认为，“新证”的考证成绩，可以概括成下述三个方面。第一，“新证”对红楼梦产生前后的一些具体的政治背景，较之过去的“红学家”，提出了很多可珍贵的资料。尽管作者对“政治背景”还存在着片面的错误的理解，有些成绩也许是不自觉的作出。但这些考证材料的提出，对于我们理解红楼梦的内容，确实有一定的帮助。　　通过虽然是最浪费笔墨的“史料编年”一章，仍然可以从当时一些历史人物的政治活动中，对于从康熙、雍正到乾隆将近百年的统治阶级内部斗争倾轧情况，有一定程度的了解。从曹家世系的官职中，也可看出满清民族奴役的政治黑暗。满清统治者，尤其是康熙，为了巩固自己的统治，镇压和奴役汉族人民的反抗，他的官吏有着世袭的特权——政治、经济上的任意妄为、奢华糜费、残酷剥削的特权。曹寅、李煦在江南一带任织造和两淮巡盐御史的职务时，曾因所造成的巨大亏空，而屡次陈请“继任，以谋偿补”。这对了解红楼梦所描写的政治的黑暗与贵族生活的豪华奢侈，是有极大意义的。从康熙南巡的材料中，可以清楚地看到，这位“廉洁皇帝”的行为，给他的臣子造成了多少残酷剥削人民的借口。拿着老百姓的“银子花的像淌海水一样”，就正是他的“德政”。
    第二，“新证”对曹雪芹的家世事迹的考证，提供了丰富的材料。我们否认胡适、俞平伯以至于周汝昌先生对红楼梦的“写实”、“自传”说的观点，并不等于否认自传性的小说，也不等于否认曹雪芹在红楼梦中概括着自己的生活经历。自传性的小说和“红学家”所理解的“自传”、“写实”说是有着根本的区别的。一个是坚决提倡艺术的典型概括，一个是坚决排斥艺术的典型概括。自传性的小说只是小说的一种样式，它虽然以作者自己的生活经历作为创作小说形象的主要基础，但仍然是能够创造出光辉的典型。如高尔基的自传性的三部曲“童年”、“人间”、“我的大学”，奥斯特洛夫斯基的“钢铁是怎样炼成的”等有名的光辉的现实主义作品。而所谓“自传”、“写实”说，是认为作者对他所描写的生活现象（包括他自己的和别人的），没有加以任何的选择和艺术的概括，更没有渗入作者对生活的理解和评价，而只是很客观地、冷静地记录这些现象，这是彻头彻尾的资产阶级的自然主义的文学观点。从此出发，可以导致种种荒谬的结论。
      “新证”能够整理出曹雪芹的家世事迹，尤其是从曹寅到曹雪芹的一段，这对于了解红楼梦所描写的贵族社会和贵族大家庭的生活内容，以及作者的经历对他创作的影响，是有帮助的。对曹家由盛到衰的较详细的考证，特别是对标明着这个封建家族由盛转衰的主要时代，即从曹寅到他的儿子曹颙、曹頫的时代的考证，除去掺杂在其中的一些不正确的说明外，仅就材料来看，确已叙述出曹家“百年盛世”的生活景象。这就能帮助说明：像曹雪芹这样的一个伟大作家，能创造出反映着整个时代复杂的精神面貌的巨著红楼梦，的确是概括着作者所生活过的环境和其家庭的生活面貌，这并不足为奇。
    第三，从上面的一个问题必然引到这样一个结论：正因为红楼梦作者有过这样的生活经历，有过书中人物的思想感情，和同样的遭遇感受，他才能创造出像贾宝玉、林黛玉以及青年一代的悲剧性格，描绘出封建统治者黑暗、虚伪、腐烂的生活真相，和封建社会崩溃前夕的完整的画幅。
    但是，肯定“新证”在考证上所获得的成就，也绝不是意味着肯定其观点和方法的正确。“新证”的观点和方法上的错误，不仅妨碍了作者正确评价红楼梦的现实主义的艺术成就，也大大妨碍了作者应该作出更多的成绩。其原因不单是“由于对现实主义的认识有错误”，而是根本不了解现实主义的真正内容。　　周汝昌先生在“我对俞平伯研究红楼梦的错误观点的看法”一文里，曾经说过：　　“一个青年知识分子，如果在解放前不懂得马克思主义而又接触红楼梦这一题目，在考证方法上就会成为胡、俞二人的俘虏，笔者个人就是一个例子。我在‘红楼梦新证’一书中，处处以小说中人物与贾家世系比附，说小说中日期与作者生活实际相合，说小说是‘精剪细裁的生活实录’，就是最突出的证明。”
    作者能够初步认识到自己的错误，是非常值得欢迎的。但“新证”的错误，却绝不简单地如作者所说的，只是“在考证方法上”“成为胡、俞二人的俘虏”。
    “新证”的全部考证工作，是为了达到证实红楼梦是“精剪细裁的生活实录”的“最终目的”。换成胡适的话说，就是老老实实地描写这一个“坐吃山空”“树倒猢狲散”的“平淡无奇”的自然主义作品。用俞平伯的话来说：“红楼梦作者底手段是写生”，“作者的态度只是一面镜子，到了面前便须眉毕露无可逃避了，妍媸虽必从镜子里看出，但所以妍所以媸的原故，镜子却不能负责。”在自然主义“自传说”的观点上，“新证”和胡、俞取得了一致，并且用全部的考证工作发展了这个观点，所不同的只是“新证”删削了“新红学家”们的自相矛盾的说法，突出地强调了“自传”说。
    周汝昌先生在谈到写“新证”的动机时说，“把红楼梦的研究由与社会政治结合引向与社会政治分家的道路，却不是我的目标；恰恰相反，我正是想在自己的学识理论的有限水平上，努力寻找红楼梦的社会政治意义，把红楼梦与社会政治更密切地结合起来看问题。”这样的动机当然是好的。但是，马克思主义对待问题的态度，是不能仅仅相信动机，而不看他的实际行动以及所产生的客观效果。毛主席说，“检验一个作家的主观愿望即其动机是否正确，是否善良，不是看他的宣言，而是看他的行为（主要是作品）在社会大众中产生的效果。社会实践及其效果是检验主观愿望或动机的标准。”依据这样的标准检查“新证”的内容，问题是比较严重的。
    我们以为，“新证”对于作家和作品的所谓“社会政治背景”的理解是不正确的，至少在某些方面是片面的。作者在“引论”中虽然谈到“乾隆朝乃是几千年封建社会宗法家庭的崩溃的一大转捩点，极盛之中孕育了衰危”；但是，他并没有用当时社会政治、经济、文化制度的发展历史情况，来论述证明这一判断，当作曹雪芹从事创作的真正的历史背景，而仅仅是把社会政治背景理解为曹家的家世。扩大一点说，是把社会政治背景简单地归结为统治阶级内部倾轧的政场上的历史事实。同时，文学作品的社会政治意义，并不是意味着它机械地影射了那些历史事件，而是在于通过艺术形象反映了什么，这些艺术形象具有着一种什么样的社会意义，亦即文学的倾向性。由此可见，作者对社会政治背景与文学的社会意义的理解是错误的。因此，也就可以理解他究竟为什么进行那样多烦琐的考证。　　“人物考”一章的错误，就在于作者较之胡、俞更加强调了曹、贾混合为一的说法。在考证曹家的家世时，用红楼梦中所描写的贾家的家世补其不足；在考证到贾家的家世时，又将已考出的曹家的家世搬回来证实。结果，除去少数有真实历史凭据的以外，大部分是臆想揣测之说。即使作为一个家谱看，“新证”所列的曹家世系表，也有一部分是为了附合红楼梦的人物表硬加上去的，并不符合实际情况。其目的虽是企图证明“写实”“自传”说之无误，结果，却由于毫无根据的主观臆测，客观上也就把自己的“写实”“自传”的说法否定了。在考证一个家族的世系时，只能根据实际材料排列，不能乱加揣想，更不能以“圈”“点”代替实际上并没有的人物。“新证”固然在形式上列出了两个完全相同的世系表，但实际上却是完全不尊重客观事实。如果在“家谱”上可以加以任意地删削增添，那么，也就可以列出很多无关的姓氏相同的世系表，变成了天下“百姓”同归一家。
    这一章中最无意义的部分就是关于曹家几门亲戚的考证。考证曹雪芹所生活的环境，自然是可以涉及到和他生活时代有关的亲族，可是，“新证”在这方面的考证却是远离开了实际的需要。因为曹雪芹的曾祖姑母嫁给甘体坦，就大量地列出了甘家的世系表、家谱等。依据同样的方法，还列出了李氏、傅恒、福彭等的家世，横枝蔓延，几无止境。而他们和红楼梦却没有丝毫关系。这样即使考证得再详细，也不过借研究红楼梦的机会，替他们整理一下家谱，而对红楼梦以及帮助读者了解曹雪芹与红楼梦，都是毫无作用的。
    当然，这种错误是和把红楼梦的内容理解为
  “精剪细裁的生活实录”的看法密切相联的。这种琐细的考证的有害作用，阻碍了读者对红楼梦中作为艺术形象的人物性格实质的认识。
      “籍贯出身”一章也同样远离了和作者有关的家世事迹的考证，竟上溯到曹雪芹的远祖时代，这正是周汝昌先生对社会政治背景的狭隘理解的具体表现。他在“引论”中曾说，“曹雪芹之能有这一部小说的伟大成就，文学天才自然不能不是一个因素，但我们尤其不能忽略了他的极其特殊的环境背景：三种稀有的结合。第一，他家的地位是奴隶和统治者的结合。……第二，他的家世是汉人与满人的结合。……第三，他家落户于江南已经六七十年之久，到曹雪芹出世，早已与江南土著无异，这又是北人与南人的结合。”这样表面地理解曹雪芹天才的社会根源显然是错误的。就作为一个事实的考证，可惜的是作者在这一个早已满化了的家庭中没找出任何满汉结合的特点。作者所企图要辨明的两个问题，由于材料的缺乏，其结论仍然是可能性的推测：即“曹家的原籍可能是丰润”，曹家可能是“辽沈边氓被虏为奴隶的”。
    如果说以上两章最大的通病是烦琐无关的考证，而在“地点问题”一章中，就完全走向了揣测的境地。作者虽然批判了“某街某坊派”，但他自己仍然是尽量在寻找大观园究竟在“某街某坊”。甚至把话头说的更硬，认为曹家在北京有宅两处，一在东城贡院紧邻，一在禁城西北护国寺一带，并进而“很疑心曹雪芹老宅就是现在的北京师范大学女生院”，而且认为一旦勘查属实，还要建议在这里开辟一个“曹雪芹纪念馆”。可是作者所依据的也只是些影影绰绰的材料，大部是把红楼梦艺术描写的地点作为证实勘查的材料。其他所谓“影影绰绰的大观园”，“荣国府第想像图”，虽也提供了一些理解曹雪芹关于宁、荣二府的艺术描写的线索，但大部分仍是承袭着“旧红学家”的随意想像，其结论不过是加上了作者想向读者灌输的“精剪细裁的生活实录”说而已。
    “史料编年”是“新证”最庞杂的一章，共二五○页，占全书三分之一以上。上起明崇祯三年（一六三○年），至清乾隆五十六年（一七九一年），其中虽然有一部分（如上面肯定过的）可取的东西，而绝大部分是前人的诗文集、县志、墓志铭等摘录。对政治、经济、文化方面的真正史料，尤其是曹雪芹时代的，却提供的很少。因此，也无法通过这个“史料编年”更好地了解时代对曹雪芹创作的影响。
    在“新索隐”一章中，作者又走向了另一个错误的途径。“新索隐”共七十五条，其观点和方法，并没有迈出旧索隐一步。旧索隐固然有些是毫无根据的乱谈，或者是生拉硬扯的附会，而新索隐则是牵强附会地企图证明红楼梦虽虚亦实之处，连时间也和历史吻合。至于诗词和境界的描写，则相似于某诗某词，“色”“空”观念来源于金瓶梅，贾琏和尤二姐的调情来源于聊斋等等看法，又和俞平伯对于“传统性”的理解，取得了一致。
    “雪芹生卒与红楼年表”一章，是作者认为“最有意义的一个收获”，实际上却是作者的错误观点发展到了顶峰。作者“把红楼梦全部读过，凡遇纪年日季节的话，和人物岁数的话，都摘录下来，编为年表，然后按了上推所得的生卒年把真朝代年数和小说配合起来”，“结果，二者符合的程度竟是惊人的”，“从雪芹出生配合宝玉降世起，到雪芹十三岁，书中宝玉也正好十三岁”。于是，作者得出结论说：“这样一部大书，百十万言，人物事情，繁杂万状，而所写岁时节序，年龄大小，竟而如此相合，井然不紊，实在令人不能不惊奇！”对于文学作品的考证工作竟能达到如此的“成功”，作者也就不禁欣欣然而认为：“可见曹雪芹的小说原是当年表写，脂砚斋也当年表看”，因而他就自称其考证工作“刚好是雪芹本意的复原”。
    但是，我们认为这不能不是极端的穿凿。一部伟大的现实主义作品，自然也要求细节的真实。红楼梦在这方面的成就也比较突出。红楼梦的叙述事物，是遵循着事件的客观进程，描写得有条不紊，入情入理，精微细致。可是，有目的的把作者本人的生卒年月和作品中人物的年月配合上去，处处采取主观附会的方法，不仅可以使曹雪芹的生卒年月和贾宝玉相符合，也可以和书中任何一个人物相符合，甚至也可以“符合到惊人的程度”。问题不在于二者在客观上是否真正相符合，而是在于作者有目的的使其相符合。这样的作法，不过仍是一种“闹着顽”的文字游戏而已，算不得真正的考证。
    通过以上对“新证”主要内容的简单分析，可以看出，贯串在全书的主要错误，绝不仅是如作者所说在“考证方法”上，成为“胡、俞二人的俘虏”，而是在观点上继承并发展了胡、俞的“写实”
  “自传”说。“新证”的全部考证工作，就是在这个观点的指导下进行的。红楼梦是“精剪细裁的生活实录”之说，是作者的考证工作的出发点，也是最后的结论。正因如此，所以才认为人物、故事、情节、时间、地点以至于种种生活小节的描写，都有事实的根据。这样，就不难了解作者所歌颂的曹雪芹是中国“第一流天才写实作家”的真实内容是什么了。
    周汝昌先生认为“新证”“主要还是想强调鲁迅先生的“写实”“自叙”说，自己似乎是鲁迅的忠实信徒和追随者。但在这一问题上，鲁迅是不能为作者辩护的。鲁迅在“中国小说史略”中认为红楼梦是“写实”“自传”的根据，部分的是引述了胡适、俞平伯的说法，这一点当然是不正确的。然而鲁迅的全部看法和胡适、俞平伯的看法还是不完全一样的。我们尊敬鲁迅，并不能连他的错误说法也一律奉为“圣经”。鲁迅作为一个伟大的思想战士，并不如某些人所说的一贯的如此，而是有着他的发展道路。他在“三闲集”序言中说：“我有一件事要感谢创造社的，是他们‘挤’我看了几种科学底文艺论，明白了先前的文学史家们说了一大堆，还是纠缠不清的疑问。并且因此译了一本蒲力汗诺夫的艺术论，以救正我——还因我而及于别人——的只信进化论的偏颇。”
    鲁迅在一九二○——一九二三年写“中国小说史略”时的思想仍然是进化论的思想，有些看法还不完全科学，而他从来也没有把它看作完全正确。因此，周汝昌先生把鲁迅前期对红楼梦的看法孤立的截取出来，为自己的见解作辩护是不妥当的。因为鲁迅后来在“且介亭杂文末编”中，就以更科学的理解纠正了自己的看法。他说，“因为世间进不了小说的人们倒多得很。然而纵使谁整个的进了小说，如果作者手腕高妙，作品久传的话，读者所见的就只是书中人，和这曾经实有的人倒不相干了。例如红楼梦里贾宝玉的模特儿是作者自己曹沾，儒林外史里马二先生的模特儿是冯执中，现在我们所觉得的却只是贾宝玉和马二先生，只有特种学者如胡适之先生之流，这才把曹沾和冯执中念念不忘的记在心儿里：这就是所谓人生有限，而艺术却较为永久的话吧。”（重点为笔者所加）鲁迅以这样对红楼梦典型创造的科学见解，尖锐地批判了胡适的说法，当然也就改变了他在“中国小说史略”中的看法。
  “新证”的作者是善于考证的，为什么就偏偏忽略了鲁迅的这段重要的话呢？为什么不从他对红楼梦的全部理论中去选择正确的科学的看法，而仅仅抓住某一点加以强调呢？“倘有取舍，即非全人，再加抑扬，更离真实”，周汝昌先生在这里直接地违背了鲁迅评论一个古典作家的科学主张。问题不难回答，与其说周汝昌先生是想证实和发挥鲁迅对红楼梦的见解，倒不如说是利用鲁迅的话来给自己的考证作招牌。由此可见，既然鲁迅曾经部分地引述过胡、俞的错误看法，可是后来又加以纠正，并发表了自己卓越的科学的新的见解，那么，周汝昌先生通过考证所努力证实的就根本不是鲁迅的看法，而恰恰是胡、俞二人的错误看法。这层微妙的“传统”关系，完全足以说明周汝昌先生错误观点的渊源及其“传统性”。这样间接地推论和“考证”的结果，也许不会认为是“偶合”吧？
    从鲁迅后期对红楼梦的正确看法出发，还可以得到这样一个启示，红楼梦的确是概括着曹雪芹自己的一些亲身经历。但是，一个伟大的艺术家，一旦将自己的生活经历，通过艺术概括的手段，将它熔铸到整个艺术形象之中去以后，那些经历也就不再是一堆事实真象的机械组合，而是以艺术形象的魅力来影响读者。任何不具有艺术魅力的
  “生活实录”，尽管是“精剪细裁”，也仍然是生活现象的记录而已，而绝不是文学作品。周汝昌先生除了用考证来证实红楼梦是“写实”“自传说”之外，又特别搬出“脂批”来作为说明红楼梦“写实性”的根据，这样作是有问题的。如果我们能正确地理解鲁迅的看法，那么，对“脂批”的问题，也就可以大体上得到一个合理的正确的解释。
    不管脂砚斋究竟是曹雪芹的“舅舅”、“叔父”、或是“棠村”、“史湘云”，但可以肯定是和曹雪芹同时的人。脂砚斋在批语中指出了红楼梦的一些故事情节是曾经发生过的事，甚至批者本人也曾经亲身经历过、参加过。但是这都只能说明曹雪芹在他所创造的艺术形象中，的确概括着自己的生活经历，说明他的创作有深厚的生活基础，而不是凭空捏造。然而却不能因为“脂批”说某些细节是“真有是事”或“作者与余实实经过也”，就一口咬定红楼梦是“精裁细剪的生活实录”。脂砚斋以其对曹雪芹的了解，和自己追怀过往的感伤情绪来批点红楼梦，其可贵的贡献是提供了红楼梦创作的某些现实生活基础，而作为文学见解来看，脂砚斋根本不能理解红楼梦作为文学作品的社会意义与思想价值，更不理解红楼梦是以经过了艺术概括的生动的形象感动了自己，打动了自己的心弦，使之“酸鼻”、“哀哉”、“可伤”、“一哭”。脂砚斋对红楼梦的总的看法，从文学批评的观点来看，也仅仅是而且绝不可能超过“自传说”，借用一句不太恰当的话，仍然是“自然主义”的文学观，这当然不是资产阶级的文学观。因此，要运用脂批来帮助理解红楼梦，如果不摆脱传统的对“脂批”跪拜到地的“符咒”式的崇拜，加以发展，提高到科学的文学理论的水平，给以合理的正确的解释，就不可能跳出“写实”“自传”“自叙”的泥沼。
  “新红学家”们以及周汝昌先生都是以这样的态度信奉着“脂批”，为他们的自然主义“写生”说作辩护，以否定红楼梦的现实主义成就和真实的思想价值。
    正因为周汝昌先生强调红楼梦的“写实性”，
  （这一概念和胡适、俞平伯的“写实”概念并无不同），所以才彻底否定后四十回红楼梦，痛骂高鹗，主张“把他的伪四十回赶快从红楼梦里割下来扔进字纸篓里去，不许他附骥流传，把他的罪状向普天下读者控诉，为蒙冤一百数十年的第一流天才写实作家曹雪芹报仇雪恨！”这种对续作者深恶痛绝的态度，严重地影响了他的考证工作。他宁肯东拉西扯地对一些根本不重要的细节考出一个可能性的悬案来，也不愿稍微用一点点实际的考证工夫，考证对红楼梦有不少功绩的并为人民所承认的作家高鹗。难道高鹗不比傅恒、纳尔苏、福彭、甘氏等更有考证价值吗？很显然，周汝昌先生不是立足于科学的文学批评的观点上进行考证，而是为了用主观的偏见强调“写实”“自传”说，故意抹煞已经具有客观价值的东西。
    当然，后四十回红楼梦的思想性与艺术性远逊于前八十回。如果曹雪芹写完全书，一定比续作更成功，更能获得广大读者的热爱。但是，伟大的天才曹雪芹并未来得及完成这部杰作，就被环境夺去了他宝贵的生命。可是，前八十回红楼梦悲剧冲突的发展趋势是明显的，因而，引起了封建主义文化奴才们的不安，狗尾续貂的大有人在。而高鹗却是在这一意义上捍卫了红楼梦的现实主义精神，发展了书中的人物性格与悲剧性的矛盾冲突，保持了悲剧的结局，因而能和前八十回共同流传在广大群众中，这对红楼梦是有其重要意义的。周汝昌先生抛弃了科学的文学批评观点，不从艺术形象的完整性方面评价后四十回续书，仅从个别文字的优劣贬低它，否定它，这种极端偏激的态度，对于红楼梦和广大读者都是非常有害的。俞平伯以唯“文情论”否定高鹗，周汝昌先生则以唯“文字论”来否定高鹗，其客观效果是完全一致的。
    “新证”强调科学考证的必要是对的，在批判了一些“旧红学家”错误的考证观点和方法之后，似乎认为自己的考证就是科学的考证。但是，通过以上的分析，可以看出，这所谓“科学的考证”，是受着怎样一种强烈的主观主义的支配。实际上仍未跳出“实验主义”考证学的阵地。
    “新证”在谈到十七、十八两回的“脂批”时说，“若像胡适只于我们能考证出来的零零碎碎、一星半点的地方，信为写实，而于雪芹费了若许气力大事铺写的两回书却一笔抹煞，若都这样，我却大感惶惑，一部大书，何处是实，何处是虚，以何标准来分疏呢？且如何判定是写实处多呢？还是虚构处多呢？若是虚构多于写实时，那么胡适自己主张的雪芹自传的说法还能成立呢？不能成立呢？”
    这一大段将艺术的完整典型机械地割裂为“虚”
  “实”的二元论的话，一方面表示责备胡适“自传说”的不彻底，另一方面也是显示自己的“自传说”的彻底，“丝毫也不容许怀疑”。“新证”确实是以完备无遗的考证工作，实践了自己的错误观点，亦即是更加继承并发展了胡适的荒谬论点，实际上并没有跳出胡适的陷阱，这就是“新证”在观点方法上产生严重错误的基本症结。
    尽管“新证”在观点和方法上存在着严重错误，但是，作为一部红楼梦作者考证的书，还是有着不少可取的东西。同时，对作为一个年青的学术研究工作者的周汝昌先生，也绝不能把他和胡适、俞平伯同等看待。作者是以艰苦的劳动，在探索着新的道路。最近，作者正在改写这本书。我们希望作者能不限于个别细节的修正，而应进一步从基本观点和方法上，进行彻底的改变，这是最根本的问题，也是决定成败的关键。我们也相信，作者如果肯于和大家一道认真地学习马克思列宁主义，用真理来武装自己，纠正自己以往的错误观点，在正确的观点方法的指导下，重新开始科学的考证工作，一定能将“红楼梦新证”改写成一本真正对读者和古典文学研究者了解曹雪芹和红楼梦有更多益处的书。这是很多读者共同的期望。周汝昌先生应在自己的学术实践中，不辜负大家的这种热诚的期望。
