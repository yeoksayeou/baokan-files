Over two million workers in Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu and other provinces are actively repairing the dikes on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Among them, Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, and other provinces have completed a total of more than 31 million cubic meters of earthwork. The trenching and reconstruction project of the Jingjiang Dike in Hubei Province has been basically completed, and now the filling of ponds inside the dike and the raising and thickening of the dike are underway. The Wuwei Dike, which protects more than 4.8 million mu of fertile land in Wuwei, Lujiang, Chaoxian, Feidong, Feixi, Shucheng, Hanshan, and Hexian counties in Anhui Province, with a total length of 108 kilometers, has also started repairs. The repairs of some sections of the dikes in Jiangxi Province are nearing completion.

Around the New Year, the climate along the river was extremely cold, but the farmers in various places were still very enthusiastic about going to the dikes. They rushed to the construction site from dozens to over a hundred miles away, carrying their dike repair tools and luggage, and immediately began their intense labor in the severe cold. During the Spring Festival, most of the workers involved in the Dongting Lake dike restoration project in Hunan Province and the Wuhan city embankment repair project did not go home and spent the festival on the dikes. Those responsible for constructing the revetment and waterproof wall along the Yangtze River from Jijiagiezui to Lijilu outside Hanzheng Street in Hankou did not rest for a single day during the Spring Festival. They drove more than 400 protective (dike) piles in the three days of the twenty-fourth, twenty-fifth, and twenty-sixth.

Based on last year's flood control experience, Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu and other provinces will raise, thicken, and strengthen the river dikes as needed this time. The Jingjiang Dike in Hubei Province, the Wuwei Dike in Anhui Province, and the river dikes in Wuhan, Huangshi, Nanjing and other cities are all being reinforced and repaired according to the standard of about one meter above the highest flood level in 1954. General dikes must also be restored to the standard of annual maintenance before the flood season last year. The entire project involves more than 250 million cubic meters of earthwork. The state has allocated 1.6 trillion yuan for the project. During the repair, all the workers paid great attention to the quality of the project. The ramming workers on the Jingjiang Dike in the Hao Xue area of Hubei Province insisted on the principle of "no ramming if the soil is not clean, no ramming if it is too wet, no ramming if the blocks are too large" when ramming, and the newly added soil was rammed very firmly.

    二百多万民工整修长江中下游两岸堤防
    湖北、湖南、安徽、江西、江苏等省二百多万民工正积极整修长江中、下游两岸的堤防。其中湖北、湖南、安徽等省已完成的土方共有三千一百多万公方。湖北省荆江大堤抽槽翻筑工程已基本结束，现正进行堤内填塘和大堤的加高培厚。捍卫着安徽省无为、庐江、巢县、肥东、肥西、舒城、含山、和县的四百八十多万亩肥沃田地、长达一百零八公里的无为大堤，也已开工整修。江西省有些堤段的整修已将完工。　
　  新年前后沿江气候奇寒，但各地农民上堤情绪仍然很高。他们纷纷从几十里以至百多里的地方，挑着修堤工具和行李赶往工地，随即冒着严寒开始了紧张的劳动。春节期间，湖南省洞庭湖堤垸修复工程和武汉市江堤整修工程的民工，大部分都没有回家，在堤上过节。担任修筑汉口汉正街外集家咀到利济路沿江护坡和防水墙的人们，春节中一天也没休息。他们在二十四、二十五、二十六三天中，共打了四百多根护（堤）脚桩。
    根据去年防汛的经验，湖北、湖南、安徽、江西、江苏等省这次都将根据需要加高培厚，加强江堤。湖北省荆江大堤，安徽省无为大堤，武汉、黄石、南京等市的江堤，都是按超过一九五四年最高洪水位一公尺左右进行加固培修的。一般堤防也要恢复到去年汛前岁修的标准。整个工程土方共有二亿五千多万公方。国家拨出的工程费有一万六千亿元。整修中，全体民工对工程质量都很重视。湖北省郝穴一带荆江大堤上的硪工，在打硪时坚持了“土不干净不打、太湿不打、块大不打”的原则，新加的土都打得很结实。（新华社）
