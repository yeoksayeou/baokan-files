Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 21st: The captain of the British merchant ship "Zheng Weijian," Church, told Xinhua reporters on the 21st, "Based on my own observations on deck, the Kuomintang planes deliberately bombed and strafed my ship, and this ship had very obvious British markings." The "Zheng Weijian" was sunk by U.S.-made Chiang Kai-shek planes at Shantou port on January 19th.

Captain Church said, "The ship was painted with three large British flags, which could be clearly seen from the air. One was thirty feet long and twenty feet wide, and the other two smaller ones were fifteen feet long and ten feet wide. I was on deck at the time and saw some planes attacking at less than two hundred feet above the sea. There is no doubt that these planes could recognize the ship's markings. But these planes still strafed my ship with machine guns and bombed it. They didn't stop until they saw us sinking. Later they left and went to attack Chinese ships."

Captain Church said that he had tried to beach the ship, but the water came in too fast because a bomb destroyed a plank, and he did not have time to sail the "Zheng Weijian" into shallow water before it sank. He said that fortunately no one was injured, although the plane's machine-gun fire had severely damaged the ship's forecastle before it sank. He said, "There were about twelve planes, and they dropped about four bombs."

All the crew members were able to go ashore safely and they are now staying in Shantou. Captain Church said that the Chinese authorities had done everything possible to help. He said, "The care we received was excellent."

According to Captain Church (from Booker's Hill, Essex, England), he has been sailing in these waters for about twelve years.

    英国商船“正伟健号”船长
    谈蒋贼飞机炸沉英商船经过
    【新华社广州二十一日电】英国商船“正伟健号”船长邱奇二十一日对新华社记者说：“根据我自己在甲板上的观察，国民党飞机故意对我的船进行轰炸和扫射，而这只船是备有十分明显的英国的标志的”。“正伟健号”是在一月十九日在汕头港口被美制蒋介石飞机炸沉的。
    船长邱奇说，“船上涂有三处大的英国国旗，从空中可以很明显地看见。一处是三十英尺长二十英尺宽，另外较小的两处是十五英尺长十英尺宽。我当时在甲板上，看到一些飞机在离海面不到二百英尺的空中进行袭击。毫无疑问，这些飞机可以辨认船上的标志。但是这些飞机还是用机关枪对我这只船进行扫射，并且用炸弹把它炸沉。他们在看到我们下沉以前一直不肯住手。后来他们离开，而去袭击中国船只。”
    船长邱奇说，他曾企图使这只船靠到海滩上，但是水进得太快，因为一枚炸弹炸毁一块船板，他没有来得及使“正伟健号”驶入浅水，这只船就沉没了。他说，幸好没有人受伤，虽然飞机在击沉这只船以前曾用机枪火力使船的前舷受到严重损失。他说：“大约有十二架飞机，它们投下约莫四枚炸弹。”
    所有的船员都能够安然上岸，他们现在呆在汕头。邱奇船长说，中国当局曾尽一切力量进行帮助。他说：“对我们的照料好极了。”
    据船长邱奇（英格兰埃赛克斯郡布卡尔斯特山人）说，他已经在这里海面上航行了十二年左右。
