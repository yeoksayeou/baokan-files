Seize the Winter and Spring Seasons to Carry Out Farmland Water Conservancy Work

The winter and spring seasons are the most suitable time to carry out farmland water conservancy work. The vast majority of farmland water conservancy construction and renovation tasks each year must be completed at this time. Missing or relaxing during this season is equivalent to postponing the completion of the task by one year. All regions should seize this season, vigorously carry out farmland water conservancy work, and regard it as an important part of spring plowing preparation.

Rural work is very busy during the winter and spring seasons. The facts in many regions have proven that farmland water conservancy work can be uniformly arranged and done simultaneously with other rural tasks. In the southern regions where construction is possible in winter, in conjunction with autumn harvesting and planting, and unified purchase and sale of grain, farmland water conservancy surveys, planning, mobilizing the masses to raise funds for labor, and organizing construction have been carried out; many regions have completed all preparatory work before the end of November, and demonstration projects and key projects have already started. Chuxian Prefecture in Anhui Province had nearly fully started work by the end of November 1954. Guangdong Province had completed the general survey of fifteen counties and the training of cadres in thirty-four counties by November; two-thirds of the key projects have been designed, and some projects have already started. Sichuan Province adopted the method of counties, districts, and townships repairing small ponds and weirs as demonstration projects level by level, driving the lower levels to carry out work, and trained more than 20,000 rural cadres and activists in water conservancy work among the masses. In many northern regions where construction is not possible in winter, while carrying out unified purchase and sale, and developing cooperatives, necessary preparations have also been made for farmland water conservancy work. Gansu Province, Liaoning Province, and Shanxi Province have all actively carried out training of water conservancy technicians, formulating farmland water conservancy construction plans, soil and water conservation plans, and so on.

It should be noted that some regions where construction is possible in winter have not yet determined the farmland water conservancy work plan and tasks for 1955, and have already delayed a period of time that could have been used; some regions do have difficulties in winter construction, but the necessary and possible preparatory work has not been actively carried out. Many comrades believe that since water conservancy work is a year-round task, it does not necessarily have to be carried out in the winter and spring seasons. They did not consider that if some projects that can be completed before spring plowing are postponed to after spring plowing, it will not only delay the needs of the season, but also cause difficulties in labor allocation; hasty construction to catch up with tasks will inevitably reduce the quality of the project. Many comrades also believe that to complete the tasks of unified purchase and sale and development of agricultural production cooperatives, farmland water conservancy work cannot be carried out at the same time. They do not understand that the ideological education work in unified purchase and sale and the mobilization work for production development can be carried out simultaneously. During the unified purchase, the masses should be mobilized to use the money from selling grain, cotton, and oil to expand production, including the construction of farmland water conservancy; the relationship between developing cooperatives and constructing farmland water conservancy is also very close. Farmland water conservancy must be collectively organized, and if arranged well, it can promote the agricultural cooperativization movement.

Therefore, all regions that have not formulated and deployed the 1955 farmland water conservancy plan should formulate a plan and deploy tasks as soon as possible based on possible conditions. The leaders of water conservancy departments should go deep into reality, investigate and research, overcome complacency and conservative thinking, and strive to make the plan detailed, specific, and feasible. Some water conservancy cadres blindly believe that the local small-scale water conservancy has developed to the point of "saturation," ignoring the very uneven development of farmland water conservancy work and the actual need for continued large-scale development, and ignoring the many potential forces for developing farmland water conservancy. This is very wrong. The formulation of plans must proceed from the actual situation, both to prevent the past mistakes of blind adventurism, and to pay attention to preventing and correcting the tendency of conservatism and stagnation. The planned figures for 1955 should exceed the actual completed tasks in 1954.

In the past few years, the area of farmland irrigation nationwide has expanded by tens of millions of mu, of which the irrigation area of mass small-scale water conservancy accounts for about 80% or more. This year, farmland water conservancy work in general areas should continue to implement the policy of focusing on the development of mass small-scale water conservancy, grasp the principles of "saving labor, saving money, and achieving great results," and the reasonable burden policy of "those who benefit bear the burden, those who do not benefit do not bear the burden, those who benefit more bear more, and those who benefit less bear less." Only in this way can we fully mobilize the masses and use the labor, financial resources, and materials of the masses to invest in small-scale farmland water conservancy projects. In order to implement this policy, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of mass farmland water conservancy work and earnestly implement "publicly run and publicly assisted." Some water conservancy work cadres believe that small-scale water conservancy projects are technically low, and district and village cadres and the masses can handle them. The water conservancy department can only manage large and medium-sized projects, and there is no need to strengthen the organization, leadership, and technical guidance of small-scale farmland water conservancy work. This is a laissez-faire thought that hinders the smooth development of mass water conservancy projects and must be corrected.

How to strengthen the organization, leadership, and technical guidance of mass farmland water conservancy work? One of the best methods is to use representative small-scale water conservancy projects as typical examples and systematically promote the specific experience of building these projects. All regions that have adopted this method have received good results. All provinces and counties with a foundation in farmland water conservancy work can find such representative small-scale water conservancy projects for demonstration. In areas with a weaker foundation, demonstration small-scale projects should also be started, summarizing experience and vigorously promoting it. On the construction site of the demonstration project, on-site training classes can be held to organize internships and cultivate technical forces. Technical knowledge can also be popularized and technical experience exchanged through observation and discussion.

Small-scale water conservancy projects also require quality first. In the technical guidance of small-scale water conservancy, it is necessary to guide the design and also guide the construction. The design should pay attention to ensuring safety, and the construction should pay attention to mastering engineering standards. In training water conservancy technical cadres and building demonstration projects, the significance of ensuring project quality must be repeatedly explained so that the participating cadres and masses can understand this principle and strictly prevent the occurrence of rework and waste, and the mistakes of wasting manpower and money. At the same time, the principles of safe construction should also be explained to prevent casualties.

While carrying out farmland water conservancy construction and renovation work, attention should also be paid to strengthening the management and maintenance of existing projects with sufficient force, establishing or reorganizing water conservancy management organizations, summarizing management experience, studying and improving methods, and formulating the 1955 management and maintenance work plan.

When arranging rural work, party and government leading organs at all levels should appropriately and uniformly arrange farmland water conservancy work and include farmland water conservancy work on their work agenda. Leaders of leading organs and agricultural production cooperatives should carefully consider and solve the water conservancy problems of agricultural production cooperatives. Cadres of water conservancy departments at all levels should overcome negative waiting moods, and under the unified leadership of party committees at all levels, give full play to their initiative and enthusiasm, and frequently report the situation and put forward suggestions to party and government leading organs at all levels so that leading organs at all levels can uniformly arrange water conservancy work in the entire rural work plan. This is a key to whether farmland water conservancy work is done well or badly. In provinces where the 1954 floods were severe, it is necessary to ensure the completion of the task of blocking breaches and restoring dikes, and also to carry out the restoration, renovation, and construction of small-scale farmland water conservancy such as ponds, culverts, and canals. The leading organs in these areas should strive to complete these two tasks at the same time.

1955 is a year of decisive significance in the construction of China's first five-year plan. Whether the task of increasing grain, cotton, and oil production in 1955 can be completed, and whether the agricultural production cooperatives in 1955 are run well or badly, are of great importance to the realization of the agricultural production plan and cooperativization plan in the first five-year plan. Developing farmland water conservancy is one of the important conditions for ensuring increased agricultural production and promoting mutual assistance and cooperation; therefore, 1955 is also a year of decisive significance for farmland water conservancy work. As far as farmland water conservancy work itself is concerned, if the task of 1955 cannot be completed, the tasks of 1956 and 1957 will inevitably increase, and part of the five-year farmland water conservancy plan will be in danger of failing. The mutual aid and cooperation movement in China's rural areas has been widely developed, which is a favorable condition for further carrying out farmland water conservancy work. By fully using this increasingly better condition, farmland water conservancy work can smoothly complete the plan.

### 抓紧冬春季节开展农田水利工作

    抓紧冬春季节开展农田水利工作
    冬春季节是开展农田水利工作最适宜的时候。历年农田水利兴修和整修的任务，绝大部分要在这个时候完成。错过或放松这个季节，就等于把任务的完成推迟一年。各地应该抓紧这个季节，大力开展农田水利工作，把它作为春耕准备工作的一个重要部分。
    冬春季节农村工作十分繁忙，许多地区的事实证明，农田水利工作是可能和其他各项农村工作统一安排并且同时做好的。在冬季可以施工的南方地区，曾经结合秋收秋种和粮食统购统销等工作，进行了农田水利的勘查、计划、发动群众自筹工款和组织施工等工作；不少地区在十一月底以前已经完成一切准备工作，示范工程和重点工程已经开工。安徽省滁县专区在一九五四年十一月底就已接近全面开工。广东省在十一月已完成了十五个县的普查和三十四个县的干部训练；三分之二的重点工程已设计完毕，部分工程已经开工。四川省采取了县、区、乡三级逐级兴修示范塘堰等小型工程、层层带动下级的办法开展工作，并且训练了两万多名乡村干部和群众中间的水利工作积极分子。在北方许多冬季不能施工的地区，在进行统购统销、发展合作社等工作的同时，也在农田水利工作方面作了必要的准备。甘肃省、辽宁省、山西省都积极进行了训练水利技术人员、制订农田水利建设计划、水土保持计划等等工作。
    应当引起大家注意的是：有些冬季可以施工的地区，到现在还没有确定一九五五年的农田水利工作计划和任务，已经延误了一段可以利用的时间；有些地区冬季施工确有困难，但必要的和可能的准备工作也没有积极进行。不少同志认为，水利工作既是全年任务，就不一定要在冬春季节进行。他们没有考虑到：如果把一些在春耕前可以完成的工程推移到春耕以后，既延误了季节的需要，又会发生劳力支配上的困难；为了赶任务仓卒施工，更难免降低工程质量。还有不少同志认为，要完成统购统销和发展农业生产合作社的任务，就不能同时进行农田水利工作。他们不了解统购统销中的思想教育工作和发展生产的动员工作是可以同时进行的，在统购过程中正应该动员群众把卖粮、卖棉、卖油料得来的钱用于扩大生产，包括兴修农田水利在内；发展合作社和兴修农田水利的关系也很密切，农田水利必须集体举办，如果安排得好，正可以促进农业合作化运动。
    因此，凡是没有拟定和布置一九五五年农田水利计划的地区，都应当根据可能的条件，尽快地订出计划，布置任务。水利业务部门的领导人员应当深入实际，调查研究，克服自满情绪和保守思想，力争把计划订的详细具体，切实可行。有些水利干部盲目地认为当地的小型水利已经发展到了“饱和”程度，而忽视了农田水利工作发展很不平衡的情况和继续大量发展的实际需要，忽视了发展农田水利的许多潜在力量，这是非常不对的。拟定计划必须从实际情况出发，既要防止曾经犯过的盲目冒进的错误，也要注意防止和纠正保守不前的倾向。一九五五年的计划数字，应当超过一九五四年实际完成任务的数字。
    几年来全国的农田灌溉面积扩大了几千万亩，其中群众性小型水利的灌溉面积约占百分之八十以上。今年一般地区的农田水利工作，应当继续贯彻以发展群众性小型水利为重点的方针，掌握“省工、省钱、收效大”的原则，和“受益负担，不受益不负担，多受益多负担，少受益少负担”的合理负担政策。只有这样，才能充分发动群众，运用群众的劳力、财力、物力投入小型农田水利工程。为了贯彻这个方针，必须加强对于群众性农田水利工作的领导，切实实行“民办公助”。有些水利工作干部认为小型水利工程技术性低，区村干部和群众都会办，水利部门可以只管大型和中型工程，不必加强对小型农田水利工作的组织领导和技术指导。这是一种放任自流的思想，障碍着群众性水利工程的顺利发展，必须加以纠正。
    怎样加强对群众性的农田水利工作的组织领导和技术指导呢？最好的方法之一是以有代表性的小型水利工程为典型，把兴修这一工程的具体经验，加以有系统的推广。凡是采用了这种方法的地区，都收到了良好的效果。凡是农田水利工作有基础的省、县，都可以找到这种可供示范的有代表性的小型水利工程。在基础较差的地区，也应当着手兴修示范的小型工程，总结经验，大力推广。在示范工程的工地，可以举办工地训练班，组织实习，培养技术力量，还可以通过观摩、座谈等方式普及技术知识，交流技术经验。
    小型水利工程同样要求质量第一。在小型水利技术指导工作中，要指导设计，也要指导施工。设计要注意保证安全，施工要注意掌握工程标准。在训练水利技术干部和兴修示范性工程时，必须反复说明保证工程质量的意义，使参加的干部和群众都能懂得这个道理，严防发生返工浪费、劳民伤财的错误。同时也应该讲明安全施工的道理，防止发生伤亡事故。
    在进行农田水利兴修和整修工作的同时，还应注意用足够的力量加强原有工程的管理养护工作，建立或整顿水利管理组织，总结管理经验，研究改进办法，制订一九五五年的管理养护工作计划。
    各级党政领导机关在安排农村工作时，应当适当地统一安排农田水利工作，把农田水利工作列入自己的工作日程。领导机关和农业生产合作社的干部，应当很好地考虑和解决农业生产合作社的水利问题。各级水利部门的干部应当克服消极等待情绪，在各级党委的统一领导下，发挥主动性和积极性，经常向各级党政领导机关汇报情况，提出建议，以便各级领导机关把水利工作统一安排在整个农村工作计划当中。这正是农田水利工作做好做坏的一个关键。在一九五四年水灾严重的省份，既要保证完成堵口复堤任务，也要进行恢复、整修和兴修塘坝、涵闸、渠道等小型农田水利的工作。这些地区的领导机关，应该力争同时完成这两方面的任务。
    一九五五年是我国第一个五年计划建设中具有决定意义的一年。一九五五年增产粮食、棉花、油料的任务能否完成，一九五五年的农业生产合作社办得好坏，对于第一个五年计划中的农业生产计划和合作化计划的实现都是有重大关系的。发展农田水利是保证农业增产和促进互助合作的重要条件之一；因此，一九五五年对于农田水利工作也是具有决定意义的一年。就农田水利工作本身来说，如果一九五五年的任务不能完成，一九五六年和一九五七年的任务势必加重，五年农田水利计划的一部分就有落空的危险。我国农村的互助合作运动已有广泛的发展，这是进一步开展农田水利工作的有利条件。充分运用这个越来越好的条件，农田水利工作是能够顺利完成计划的。
