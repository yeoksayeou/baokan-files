　　The south bank of the Honghe River in Yunnan Province is a rich and beautiful region. The Ailao Mountains stretch from north to south throughout the area, and on the overlapping mountain slopes are arranged thousands of terraced fields. Although winter has long since arrived, the mountains are still covered with green trees and grass. In the river valleys, dense banana and pineapple groves and tall betel nut trees are interspersed with villages. The mountaintops are perpetually shrouded in clouds and mists, winding around endless forests.

　　The more than ten fraternal ethnic groups living on this land, including the Hani, Yi, Yao, Miao, and Dai, are industrious. They have reclaimed hundreds of thousands of mu of fertile land between the high mountains and deep valleys, channeling mountain streams and springs into waterways, turning the mountainous region into a "land of fish and rice where mountains are high and water is long, the higher the mountains, the longer the water."

　　Recently, I visited Dazongqiao Village in Yuanyang County, Honghe Hani Autonomous Region, an ordinary Hani village. In the past, the Kuomintang reactionary government levied dozens of kinds of exorbitant taxes here, and bandits constantly robbed and harassed the people, causing more than two hundred households in the village to either wander in other places or live in the mountains eating wild vegetables and tree leaves. Now, with the help of the People's Government, the Hani people have rebuilt their homes. The autumn harvest has just ended, and every household is drying rice and cotton in front of their doors. Women are spinning yarn and sewing new clothes in the early winter sunshine, and men are busy adding new houses. In the morning, children drive flocks of chickens and ducks outside the village. In the evening, the melodious sounds of bamboo flutes and four-stringed instruments accompany groups of young men and women singing to their hearts' content around bonfires.

　　In Maizitian Village in Honghe County, I met an Yi girl named Ma Naibai, who is only twenty years old this year. Unfortunately, she suffered from an eye disease before liberation. After liberation, the county established a health center and provided her with free treatment. At the beginning of last year, a medical team came to their village again to continue treating her, and after three years of blindness, her eyes finally regained their sight. Now she is not only a production expert, but also attends literacy classes and has learned embroidery. When I praised her writing and beautiful embroidery, I saw happy smiles on the faces of her elderly mother and herself.

　　As I crossed the towering mountains on the south bank of the Honghe River, walked through every village, and visited every ethnic group, I saw a scene of joy everywhere. People use songs to express their past grievances and to express their joy today. On the eve of the first anniversary of the establishment of the autonomous region, I heard a group of Dai girls who came to participate in the celebration sing such a moving song: "Our clothes are all new, our fields are all gold, our sky is all blue, our hearts are all happy. Chairman Mao's sun shines on the south bank of the Honghe River, and the fraternal ethnic groups smile!"

　　When I was in the Honghe area, whether on warm and sunny days or on starry nights, I heard such joyful songs coming from the villages. That song, like the endless Honghe River water, will forever reverberate in the valleys of the border region.

    欢乐的红河
    新华社记者　黄昌禄
    云南省内红河南岸，是一块富饶美丽的地区。哀牢山从北而南遍布全区，在峰峦层叠的山坡上，排列着千万丘梯田。虽然冬天早已来临，但山峦间仍是绿树青草，在河谷地带，茂密的香蕉、菠萝和高大的槟榔树中间，散布着一个个村寨；高山顶上，终日不散的云雾，缭绕着绵延不绝的森林。
    生活在这块土地上的哈尼、彝、瑶、苗、傣等十多种兄弟民族是勤劳的。他们在高山深谷之间，开垦出几十万亩肥田沃土，把山上的溪流和泉水汇入一条条水沟里，把山区变成了“山有多高，水有多长，山高水长，鱼米之乡。”
    最近，我访问了红河哈尼族自治区的元阳县大宗巧寨，这是一个普通的哈尼族村寨。过去国民党反动政府在这里要派上几十种苛捐杂税，加以土匪不断抢劫骚扰，使寨子里的二百多户人家，有的流浪到外乡，有的在山林中吃野菜树叶生活。现在，哈尼族人民在人民政府的帮助下已重建了自己的家园。秋收才结束，家家门前晒着稻谷和棉花，妇女们在初冬的阳光下纺线、缝制新衣，男子们正忙着添盖新房。早上，孩子们赶着成群的鸡鸭往寨子外边放，傍晚，在一堆堆的篝火旁边，悠扬的竹笛和四弦琴声伴着一群小伙子和姑娘们在尽情地歌唱。
    在红河县的麦子田寨，我会见了一个叫马乃白的彝族姑娘，她今年才二十岁。但不幸在解放前患了眼病。解放后县里成立了卫生院，给她免费治疗。去年初，一个医疗队又到了她们的寨子，继续给她医治，瞎了三年的眼睛终于又重见光明了。她现在不但是生产能手，而且还上了识字班，学会了绣花。当我称赞她写的字和美丽的刺绣时，我看见她的年老的妈妈和她自己的脸上，都泛起了幸福的微笑。
    当我翻越过红河南岸的重重山岭，走过每一个村寨，访问每一种民族的时候，我都看见一片欢乐的情景。人们用歌声来吐诉过去的哀怨，用歌声来表达今日的欢欣。在自治区成立一周年前夕，我听到一群来参加庆祝的傣族姑娘唱了这样一支动人的歌：“我们的衣服一片新，我们的田坝一片金，我们的天空一片蓝，我们的心里一片乐。毛主席的太阳照着红河南岸，兄弟民族笑盈盈！”
    我在红河区的时候，不管在日暖风和的日子，或在月明星稀的夜晚，都听见过村寨里传出这种欢乐的歌声。那歌声，就像流不尽的红河水，永远震荡在边疆的山谷之间。
