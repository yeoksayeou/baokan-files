    Hainan Island Farmers Spring Ploughing and Rice Planting
    Spring ploughing activities in various parts of Hainan Island have been launched successively, and rice transplanting has been completed in several counties in the northeast.
    In order to carry out agricultural technology reform, Hainan Island has trained a total of 3,000 farmer technicians and established many new technology dissemination stations. In counties where rice transplanting has been completed, all mutual aid and cooperative organizations have promoted a series of advanced cultivation techniques centered on small-seedling close planting to varying degrees.
    Various parts of Hainan Island have also launched a surge in water conservancy construction, with thousands of trained farmer water conservancy technicians as the backbone. In Qiongshan County, more than 100 agricultural production cooperatives have converted 6,000 mu of single-cropping fields (planting one crop a year) into double-cropping fields (planting two crops a year) due to water conservancy construction. Sixty-three agricultural production cooperatives in Qiongdong County have also transformed 2,000 mu of single-cropping fields. It is estimated that more than 7,000 water conservancy projects have been built on the island, benefiting 400,000 mu of farmland, of which 160,000 mu of single-cropping fields can be converted into double-cropping fields.
    This year, the goal of Hainan Island farmers' efforts is to increase the total grain output by 15% compared to last year. (Xinhua News Agency)

    海南岛农民春耕插秧
    海南岛各地春耕活动陆续展开，东北部几个县已插秧完毕。
    为了进行农业技术改革，海南岛各地共训练了三千个农民技术员和新建立了不少技术传授站。已完成插秧的县份，所有互助合作组织都程度不同地推行了以小株密植为中心的一系列先进耕作技术。
    海南岛各地还以经过训练的成千个农民水利技术员为骨干，展开了兴修水利的热潮。琼山县一百多个农业生产合作社由于兴修水利，把六千亩单造田（一年种一季）改成双造田（一年种两季）。琼东县六十三个农业生产合作社也改造了两千亩单造田。全岛估计共兴修水利七千多宗，受益农田四十万亩，当中有十六万亩单造田可以改为双造田。
    今年海南岛农民努力的目标是使粮食总产量比去年增加百分之十五。　（新华社）
