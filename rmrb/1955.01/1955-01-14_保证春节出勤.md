    Guarantee Spring Festival Attendance
    Shi Ming
    The Shijiazhuang Power Machinery Factory recently formulated a work plan to ensure normal attendance of employees during the Spring Festival, deciding to conduct this education among employees as early as possible. Their plan is roughly divided into three points: First, conduct extensive and in-depth propaganda and education among employees regarding the liberation of Taiwan and opposition to the US-Chiang "mutual defense treaty," mobilizing employees to work with peace of mind and maintain normal attendance during and around the Spring Festival, and guide employees to formulate specific plans and competition guarantee conditions. Second, gain an in-depth understanding of the employees' situations, then convene different types of forums, or conduct individual education, explaining the great significance of ensuring attendance this Spring Festival. For employees who must return home, focus on education about the worker-peasant alliance and the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, preventing any incorrect behavior that may occur when employees return to their hometowns. Third, improve the food and cultural entertainment activities during the Spring Festival, ensuring that employees who are at the factory during the holidays can "eat well and have fun." The Shijiazhuang Power Machinery Factory, according to this plan, has now actively launched various activities.
    It is very necessary for the Shijiazhuang Power Machinery Factory to seize the time and do a good job in ensuring Spring Festival attendance. Ensuring the normal attendance of employees during and around the Spring Festival this year has special importance compared to previous years. We know that this year is the decisive year of our country's first five-year plan. The workload of industrial capital construction this year will be more than any previous year, and industrial production will continue to increase by more than 13 percent based on last year. Ensuring the normal progress of production during and around the Spring Festival is an important link in ensuring that the first quarter's tasks can be completed as scheduled. Therefore, this year, all enterprises must do a better job than in previous years to ensure the normal attendance of employees during and around the Spring Festival, and not do worse. Otherwise, this year's heavy production and capital construction tasks will be in an unfavorable situation from the beginning, affecting the normal progress of the whole year's work.
    However, there are still many enterprises and institutions that have not paid attention to this important issue. The Hebei Provincial Trade Union and the Baoding Municipal Trade Union recently inspected the Spring Festival attendance guarantee work of grassroots trade unions in enterprises in Baoding City and found that this work was progressing very slowly in many units in Baoding City. There was a relatively serious idea among grassroots leading cadres of neglecting this year's Spring Festival attendance guarantee work, satisfied with the achievements and experience of last year's attendance guarantee work. In response to this situation, the Baoding Municipal Trade Union has now re-arranged the work and sent cadres to help enterprises and institutions arrange this work. This is very necessary. The situation like that in Baoding City is certainly not an isolated case. The relevant leading organs in various places should, like the Baoding Municipal Trade Union, immediately conduct a thorough inspection and supervision of their subordinate enterprises.
    The Spring Festival is approaching, we must both enable employees to happily celebrate the festival and ensure the normal progress of production during and around the Spring Festival—this is an urgent and important task that is currently placed before the enterprise departments and must be done well. It is hoped that factories, mines, transportation and other enterprise departments in various places will learn from the practice of the Shijiazhuang Power Machinery Factory and take action immediately.

    保证春节出勤
    施明
    石家庄动力机械厂不久前订出了一个保证春节期间职工正常出勤的工作计划，决定及早在职工中进行这一教育。他们的计划大体分为三点：一、广泛深入地向职工进行解放台湾、反对美蒋“共同防御条约”的宣传教育，动员职工在春节前后安心生产、正常出勤，并引导职工订出具体计划和竞赛保证条件。二、深入了解职工的情况，然后召开不同类型的座谈会，或进行个别教育，说明保证今年春节出勤的重大意义。对于必须回家的职工，着重进行工农联盟和粮食统购统销政策的教育，防止职工回乡时可能发生的一些不正确行为。三、搞好春节的伙食和文化娱乐活动，保证休假期间在厂的职工能“吃好，玩好”。石家庄动力机械厂根据这个计划，现在已经积极地展开了各种活动。
    石家庄动力机械厂及早抓紧做好保证春节出勤的工作，这是很有必要的。今年保证春节前后职工的正常出勤，比往年有特殊的重要性。我们知道，今年是我国第一个五年计划的决定性的一年，今年工业基本建设工作量将比过去任何一年为多，工业生产也将在去年的基础上继续增长百分之十三以上。而保证春节前后生产的正常进行，就是保证今年第一季度任务能否如期完成的重要一环。所以今年各企业保证职工春节前后正常出勤的工作，必须比往年做得更好，而不能比往年做得差。否则，今年繁重的生产和基本建设任务在一开始就会处于不利的情况下，影响全年工作的正常进行。
    但是，现在还有不少企业单位没有注意到这个重要问题。河北省工会和保定市工会最近检查了保定市企业基层工会的春节保证出勤工作，发现保定市许多单位这个工作进行得很迟缓，基层领导干部中有较严重的忽视今年春节保证出勤工作的思想，满足于去年保证出勤工作的成绩和经验。保定市工会针对这个情况，现在已重新作了布置，并派出干部，帮助企业单位安排这一工作。这是很必要的。像保定市那样的情况，当然决不是少数，各地有关的领导机关，目前很有必要像保定市工会那样，立即对所属企业进行一次深入的检查和督促。
    春节眼看就要到了，我们既要使职工们能欢欢喜喜的过节，又要保证春节前后生产的正常进行，——这就是目前摆在企业部门面前一项急迫的而又必须做好的重要工作。希望各地工厂、矿山和交通运输等企业部门，学习石家庄动力机械厂的做法，立即行动起来。
