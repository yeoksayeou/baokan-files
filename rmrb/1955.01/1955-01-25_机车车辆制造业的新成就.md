New Achievements in Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing

    In 1954, locomotive and rolling stock manufacturing plants across China produced thousands of locomotives, freight cars, and passenger cars. The Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant successfully trial-produced the "KM1" type freight locomotive last year and has now begun formal production of this locomotive. After successfully trial-producing the "KM1" type locomotive and new-style sleeping car in 1952 and 1953, the Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant trial-produced a new type of superior dining car in 1954. Last year, locomotive and rolling stock manufacturing plants across the country also manufactured many 30-ton refrigerated cars, heavy-tonnage boxcars, open cars, hard-seat passenger cars, and sleeping cars, etc.

    The newly built locomotives and rolling stock have been greatly improved in performance and quality. The design of freight cars adopts heavy tonnage and partial electric welding structure, which increases the load capacity and reduces the dead weight of the vehicles, thereby improving the utilization rate of transportation equipment. The newly built iron sheet boxcars can ensure safe transportation. The newly built passenger cars are beautiful in style, with spacious and comfortable seats; the interior is equipped with heating and air supply equipment, which is warm in winter and cool in summer. The new dining car is well-equipped with refrigerated cabinets and insulated cabinets. The interior can accommodate forty-eight passengers dining at the same time.

    机车车辆制造业的新成就
    我国各地机车车辆制造厂，一九五四年制造了数千台机车、货车和客车。大连机车车辆制造厂在去年试制成功了“ㄎ冖1”型的货运机车，现在已开始正式生产这种机车。青岛四方机车车辆制造厂在一九五二和一九五三年试制“ㄎ冖1”型机车和新式卧车取得成功以后，一九五四年又试制了一种新型的优等餐车。去年各地机车车辆制造工厂还制造了许多三十吨的冷藏车、重吨位的棚车、敞车、硬席座车和卧车等。
    新造的机车与车辆，在性能上和质量上都有很大改进。货车设计采用了重吨位和局部电焊结构，增加了载重量，减轻了车辆的自重，因此提高了运输设备的利用率。新造的铁皮棚车可以保证安全运输。新造的客车，样式美观，座位宽大舒适；室内有暖气设备和送风设备，冬暖夏凉。新型餐车的设备完善，有冷藏橱和保温橱。室内可供四十八位旅客同时进餐。
