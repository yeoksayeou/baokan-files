	Guangdong and Guangxi Sea Salt Begin Exporting

	Guangdong and Guangxi's sea salt has begun to be exported this year. Last year, sea salt production in the two Guangdong and Guangxi regions created the highest annual output record in history, with a total of 13 million dan of salt, more than 30% higher than the year with the highest salt production in history – 1943. This has changed the historical situation where the sea salt in Guangdong and Guangxi was insufficient for consumption in the region, and from January this year, it has begun to be exported to Hunan, Jiangxi and other places.

    广东广西海盐开始外销
    广东广西的海盐今年开始外销。去年，两广地区的海盐生产创造了历史上年产量最高纪录，共产盐一千三百万担，比历史上产盐最多的一年——一九四三年还多百分之三十以上。这就改变了历史上两广海盐不够本区消费的情况，并从今年一月起已开始外销至湖南、江西等地。　（林建徵）
