    Storing Water and Growing Ice to Solve Spring Planting Water Needs
    Since the beginning of winter, farmers in the Zhangjiakou Special District of Hebei Province have been digging ice cellars, building earth and grass dams, constructing river weirs, ice-growing weirs, and organizing more than 190 ice-growing sites along rivers such as the Tongqiao River, Longyang River, Qingshui River, Hongtang River, and the Shuiyuquan stream area. Currently, the ice grown is four to five "gongcun" to seven to eight "gongcun" thick. It is estimated that the district can utilize ice water to irrigate 900,000 mu of spring land. Combined with the 350,000 mu of autumn-irrigated land from last year, it is expected that 1,250,000 mu of land can be planted in a timely manner this spring.
    The Zhangjiakou Special District has high altitude, cold climate, and dry weather. In past years, there has been much wind and little rain in the spring, affecting spring planting every year. Since 1950, the local People's Government has summarized and promoted the experiences of Li Hewang, a water conservancy labor model in Huaian County, such as "storing water and growing ice" and "digging ice channels." As soon as winter arrives, it mobilizes farmers along the rivers to "store water and grow ice," and in the spring, it uses the ice water to irrigate the land, ensuring that these lands can be planted in a timely manner.

    蓄水养冰解决春耕用水
    入冬以来，河北省张家口专区农民，在通桥河、龙洋河、清水河、洪塘河等河流及水峪泉溪地带，打冰窟、筑土草坝、拦河堰、养冰堰及举办泉溪养冰达一百九十余处，目前已养冰四、五公寸到七、八公寸厚。估计全区可利用冰水春汇地九十万亩，加上去年三十五万亩秋汇地，预计今年可使一百二十五万亩土地适时进行春耕播种。
    张家口专区地势高寒，气候干燥，历年春季风多雨少，年年影响春耕播种。当地人民政府从一九五○年总结与推广了怀安县水利劳动模范李河旺“蓄水养冰”、“打冰槽”等经验后，一到冬季就发动沿河农民“蓄水养冰”，春季利用冰水汇地，保证了这些土地能够及时进行春季播种工作。
