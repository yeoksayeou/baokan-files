Why "Unsaleable" Local and Special Products Have Become Best-Sellers
    Zhao Jingyi

Local and special products from the Xuchang area of Henan Province are now sold all over the country. Among them are large and small carrying baskets for basic construction sites, safflower needed by the Zhuang people of Guangxi Province, bellows needed by the people of Inner Mongolia.... According to statistics from October and November 1954, in addition to mutual exchanges between counties within the Xuchang area, local and special products sold to Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Guangxi, Luoyang, Xi'an, Wuhan, Tianjin and other places included more than ten kinds such as square baskets, carrying baskets, bellows, bamboo baskets, cattle muzzles, safflower, medlar, almonds, and cotton paper, with a total value of 2,213 million yuan. In November, cadres from supply and marketing cooperatives in eight provinces came to Xuchang to sign contracts. What were once considered "unsaleable and without a way out" local and special products have now become best-selling goods. Farmers have greatly increased their sideline production opportunities, and their confidence in overcoming disasters and developing production has been enhanced.

In the past, the production and sales of local and special products in the Xuchang area were very sluggish, farmers had very limited sideline opportunities, and cadres of the supply and marketing cooperatives, under the control of capitalist ideology and business practices, believed that local and special products were of "low quality, high price, bad specifications, and no market," and were unwilling to purchase them. They only managed a small number of seasonal products, and even these were long-term stockpiled and unsaleable. The masses were dissatisfied with the supply and marketing cooperatives, and the cadres of the supply and marketing cooperatives often complained about the masses. Many people once believed that after the implementation of unified purchase and sales, sideline opportunities had decreased and there was nothing to do. However, they did not realize that what was being restricted were commercial speculative activities that were unfavorable to the national economy and the people's livelihood. They also did not realize that with the development of economic construction, a broader path had been opened up for sideline occupations and handicrafts, nor did they realize that in the new situation where the free market had shrunk, more attention should be paid to organizing, leading, and assisting the sideline production of the peasant masses. Some people only shouted "vigorous support" but did not make plans; or made plans but did not meet with the masses, and did not seriously implement the plans, making the plans "empty talk on paper"; many supply and marketing cooperatives did not know the types, production capacity, or distribution of the sideline occupations of the peasant masses.

Last summer and autumn, some areas suffered serious floods. In July and August, cadres of the Xuchang area supply and marketing cooperative conducted a study, focusing on examining capitalist ideology and business practices, and establishing the idea of serving the peasant masses. Most cadres realized that during the period of the country's planned economic construction, the socialist economy occupied a leading position in the countryside; one of the important tasks of the supply and marketing cooperatives was to promote the organization of farmers; in disaster-stricken areas, they also had the task of actively supporting the disaster victims to overcome the disaster and restore and maintain production vitality. The area supply and marketing cooperative focused on studying the procurement, processing, and supply tasks in the disaster area. Each county supply and marketing cooperative assigned full-time cadres to be responsible for production and disaster relief work, and went deep into the disaster area to find out the production and sales situation, further understand the needs of the disaster victims, and make plans to serve the disaster victims. From this time on, there was a fundamental change in business attitude and business direction.

It is not enough to just change ideas and attitudes. After the cadres of the supply and marketing cooperatives in the Xuchang area established the idea of serving the masses, they all realized that they should purchase the sideline products of the farmers. However, because of the lack of external contacts, the sales channels were still not opened up. Before October, the sales volume was still not large, resulting in a serious backlog, which directly affected the purchase of local and special products. Only focusing on purchasing and neglecting sales cannot achieve the purpose of serving the peasant masses.

The cadres of the Xuchang area supply and marketing cooperative conducted a detailed analysis and research, and found that the key to further developing business was to strengthen internal and external contacts and strengthen product promotion. They first exchanged information with each other in the counties within the area. The supply and marketing cooperatives of Yancheng and Shangshui counties also organized large-scale exhibitions and exchanges of local and special products. Cadres of the Xuchang branch of the Henan Provincial Cooperative Union's sales department carried samples of various local and special products to contact Xi'an, Hankou, Guangzhou and other places, and went deep into the supply and marketing cooperatives and rural areas in various places to understand the needs and habits of the local people. They also printed the names, specifications, uses, origins, and prices of various local and special products in the Xuchang area into booklets or single pages, and distributed them to counties in other provinces. Facts have proved that local and special products are not without a market; the reason for the past "sluggish sales" was that the capitalist ideology and work style of the cadres of the supply and marketing cooperatives blocked the sales channels.

After doing the purchasing work and finding the sales channels, is the work of the supply and marketing cooperative finished? Of course not. The peasant masses in the Xuchang area do not understand the living habits of people all over the country, so the specifications and quality of some products do not meet the requirements of the masses in various places; this limits sales to a certain extent. To open up wider sales channels, it is also necessary to organize disaster victims to improve the specifications, styles, and quality of products according to the needs and usage habits of people in other places, and improve production technology. For example, the people in the Xuchang area are accustomed to pulling the bellows with their left hand, but the people in Xi'an and other places are accustomed to pulling it with their right hand, and the people in Inner Mongolia are accustomed to pulling it alternately with both hands. Therefore, the bellows must be modified according to the habits of the people in various places.

In order to organize farmers to produce according to production and sales plans and the needs of consumers in sales areas, Yancheng, Shangshui and other counties have held exhibitions to explain the styles, specifications, and quality of products to producers with physical objects. Some county supply and marketing cooperatives, under the unified leadership of the Party, in addition to relying on the original agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation organizations, also organized some temporary production groups by industry and profession to help disaster-stricken farmers solve the problems of lack of funds and technology; and held some small-scale technical seminars to promote mutual teaching and learning and the method of apprentices learning from masters, and improved production technology. After the supply and marketing cooperatives did so much work, they signed purchase, processing, and supply contracts with farmers, which played a great role in improving the enthusiasm of the masses for production and ensuring the completion of production and sales plans.

The sales channels of local and special products in the Xuchang area have become wider, the sideline production opportunities for the peasant masses have increased, the masses are happy, and the cadres of the supply and marketing cooperatives are also happy. In the past, cadres of the Xuchang area supply and marketing cooperatives traveled around to find sales channels for local and special products. Now, those who need them from all over the country come to the door to order goods. Now the problem is no longer "sluggish sales," but how to strive to meet the needs of customers.

    “滞销”的土产特产为什么畅销起来了
    赵静一
    河南省许昌地区的土产特产，现在走遍了全国各地。其中有基本建设工地用的大小抬筐，有广西省僮族人民需要的红花，有内蒙古人民需要的风箱……。据一九五四年十月、十一月统计，除在许昌专区的县和县之间互相交流外，推销到山西、内蒙古、广西、洛阳、西安、武汉、天津各地的土产特产品计有八方筐、抬筐、风箱、竹篮、牛笼嘴、红花、枸?、杏仁、棉纸等十多种，总值二十二亿一千三百多万元。十一月份，又有八个省的供销合作社干部来到许昌签订合同。过去所谓“滞销，没出路”的土产特产，如今都变成了畅销货。农民们的副业生产门路比以前大大增多了，战胜灾荒、发展生产的信心提高了。
    过去，许昌专区土产特产的产销情况十分萧条，农民的副业门路很窄，供销合作社的干部在资本主义思想和经营作风支配下，认为土产特产品“质量低，价格高，规格坏，没销路”，不愿收购；他们只经营少量季节性产品，还长期积压着销不出去。群众对供销合作社不满意，供销合作社的干部也常常埋怨群众。很多人曾经认为：实行统购统销以后，副业门路减少了，没啥可干了；却没有认识到受到限制的都是些不利于国计民生的商业投机活动，没有认识到随着经济建设的发展，已经给副业、手工业开辟了更广阔的道路，也没有认识到在自由市场缩小了的新形势下，对于农民群众的副业生产应当更注意加以组织、领导和帮助。有的光喊叫“大力支持”，但不作计划；或者作了计划，但不和群众见面，不认真执行计划，使计划成为“纸上谈兵”；许多供销合作社对于农民群众的副业种类、生产能力、分布情况都不摸底。
    去年夏秋，部分地区遭受了严重的水灾。许昌专区供销社干部在七、八月份进行了一次学习，着重检查了资本主义思想和经营作风，树立了为农民群众服务的思想。多数干部认识到：在国家有计划地进行经济建设的时期，社会主义经济在农村占据了领导地位；供销合作社的重要任务之一，就是促进农民组织起来；在受灾地区，更担负着积极地支持灾民战胜灾荒，恢复和保持生产元气的任务。专区供销合作社着重研究了灾区收购、加工和供应任务，各县供销合作社都抽出专职干部负责生产救灾工作，并深入灾区摸清产销情况，进一步了解灾民的要求，做出了为灾民服务的计划。从这时开始，经营态度和业务方向都有了根本的转变。
    光是转变思想和态度还是不行的。许昌专区各县供销合作社干部树立了为群众服务的思想以后，都注意到应该收购农民的副业产品，但是，因为对外缺乏联系，销路还是没有打开。十月份以前，销货量仍然不大，发生了严重的积压现象，直接影响了土产特产的收购工作。只重收购，忽视推销，仍然不可能达到为农民群众服务的目的。
    许昌专区供销合作社的干部又详细地进行了分析研究，找出进一步开展业务的关键，在于加强内外联系，加强商品介绍工作。他们首先在专区以内的各县之间互相交流了情况，郾城、商水等县供销合作社还组织了规模较大的土特产品物资展览交流会。河南省合作社联合社推销经理部许昌分经理部的干部，携带着各种土产特产样品，到西安、汉口、广州等地联系，并深入到各地的供销合作社和农村，了解当地群众的需要和习惯。他们还把许昌专区的各种土产特产的品名、规格、用途、产地、价格印成小册子或单页，散发到外省各县。事实证明了，土产特产并不是没有销路的；过去“滞销”的原因，是供销合作社的干部的资本主义思想作风把销路堵住了。
    做了收购工作，又找到了销路，供销合作社的工作是不是就算做完了呢？当然不是这个样子。许昌专区的农民群众不了解天南地北各地人民群众的生活习惯，所以有些产品的规格、质量不合乎各地群众的要求；这样，就使销路受到一定的限制。要打开更宽广的销路，就还要组织灾民按照外地群众的需要和使用习惯，改进产品的规格、式样、质量，提高生产技术。譬如，许昌地区群众使用风箱习惯用左手拉，但是西安等地群众习惯用右手拉，内蒙古的习惯是左右手轮换着拉，因此，就要按照各地群众习惯把风箱加以改装。
    为了组织农民按照产销计划和销地群众的需要进行生产，郾城、商水等县都举办了展览会，用实物向生产者讲明产品式样、规格、质量。有些县的供销合作社在党的统一领导下，除依靠原有的农业生产互助合作组织以外，又分行分业组织了一些临时性的生产组，帮助受灾农民解决了缺乏资金、缺乏技术的问题；并且召开了一些小型技术研究会，推行互教互学和以师带徒的办法，改进了生产技术。供销合作社做了这许多工作之后，就和农民订立了收购、加工、供应合同，这对于提高群众的生产积极性和保证产销计划的完成起了很大作用。
    许昌地区土产特产的销路广阔了，农民群众的副业生产门路增多了，群众喜欢了，供销合作社的干部也高兴了。过去许昌专区的供销合作社干部奔波各地为土特产品找销路，现在各地需要者纷纷找到门上来订货。现在的问题不再是“滞销”，而是怎样努力满足顾客的需要了。
