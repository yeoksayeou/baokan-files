    1954 was a year of significant achievements for all employees in Beijing. The completion of the national plan on the industrial production front showed greater progress than in 1953. According to statistics from 139 enterprise units, including state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private enterprises in the city, the total industrial output value plan for 1954 was completed at 111.3%, an increase of more than 26% compared to 1953. 115 enterprise units completed and overfulfilled their plans, and costs were reduced compared to the national plan, allowing the factories and mines to remit an additional 200 billion yuan in profits to the state. After the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant completed its annual pig iron production plan on December 17th last year, the employees of the iron smelting department revised the production increase plan, changing the original plan to increase pig iron production by 10,000 tons to 15,000 tons. They proposed to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan with more production achievements. As of December 31st, they successfully completed the 15,000-ton pig iron production increase plan. The Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, through the efforts of all employees throughout the year, overfulfilled the 1954 national plan, with a total output value increase of 47.94% compared to 1953; labor productivity increased by 36.62% compared to 1953. Currently, all employees in the city are actively working to complete the 1955 national plan.

    北京市去年工业总产值比前年显著增长
    一九五四年是北京市全体职工取得显著成绩的一年。在工业生产战线上完成国家计划的情况比一九五三年有了较大的进步。据全市国营、地方国营和公私合营等一百三十九个企业单位的统计，一九五四年完成全年工业总产值计划百分之一百一十一点三，比一九五三年增长了百分之二十六以上。完成和超额完成计划的有一百一十五个企业单位，成本比国家计划降低了，各厂矿可多向国家上缴二千亿元的利润。石景山钢铁厂在去年十二月十七日完成全年生铁产量计划后，炼铁部的职工又修订了增产计划，把原计划增产生铁一万吨，改为增产一万五千吨。他们提出要以更多的生产成绩，来支援人民解放军解放台湾。截至十二月三十一日，胜利地完成了一万五千吨生铁的增产计划。北京农业机械厂，经过全体职工一年来的努力，超额完成一九五四年国家计划，总产值比一九五三年增长了百分之四十七点九四；劳动生产率比一九五三年提高百分之三十六点六二。现在，全市职工正积极地为完成一九五五年国家计划而努力。
