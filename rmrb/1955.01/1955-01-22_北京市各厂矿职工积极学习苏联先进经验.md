Beijing's state-owned and locally state-owned factories and mines have been actively studying advanced Soviet experience, diligently researching and improving technical equipment, playing an important role in exceeding the state plan for 1954.

Liu Zhengwu, an engineer in the Ironmaking Department of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, organized all the workers in the workshop to conscientiously study advanced Soviet experience such as furnace top regulation, graded charging, and steam blasting, which enabled the qualified rate of pig iron quality to reach 99.7%, playing a significant role in ensuring the comprehensive completion of the Ironmaking Department's 1954 plan. The Xicheng Substation Group of the Beijing Power Supply Bureau High Voltage Institute, due to the group's workers conscientiously implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts, studying and implementing regulations and systems, created a new record of 440 days without misoperation.

According to many labor models who attended the Beijing Labor Model Representative Conference, almost all of them had several to more than a dozen technical innovations and rationalization proposals, which played a very important role in the production of their units. Feng Xiqian of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory improved two types of inspection tools. In the past, the factory had to inspect more than 10,000 waterwheel chain links every day, which required ten inspection workers. Feng Xiqian created a tool for inspecting waterwheel chain links, and now only one person can inspect more than 10,000 waterwheel chain links every day. He also designed an electrical transmission testing machine for inspecting harvesters. In the past, inspecting harvesters required livestock to pull them for testing in the fields. Now, with the electrical transmission testing machine he designed, there is no need for livestock, and inspections can be carried out in the factory building, shortening the inspection time and accurately inspecting the performance and specifications of the harvester. Zheng Chongxiao, a young reinforcing bar worker at the People's Motor Factory, created eight tools for making electric fan guards, increasing production by five and a half times. In addition, Liu Feng, a mechanic in the manufacturing workshop of the Liulihe Cement Plant, often studied and improved machinery and equipment. He implemented eight technical improvements in one year, and the two improvements of the No. 2 powder separator and clinker crusher alone saved the state more than 460 million yuan.

    北京市各厂矿职工积极学习苏联先进经验
    北京市各国营、地方国营厂矿企业职工积极学习苏联先进经验，努力钻研与改进技术设备，对超额完成一九五四年国家计划起了重要的作用。
    石景山钢铁厂炼铁部工程师刘正五组织全车间职工认真学习了炉顶调剂、分级入炉和蒸气鼓风等苏联先进经验，使生铁质量合格率达到百分之九十九点七，对保证炼铁部全面完成一九五四年计划起了很大的作用。北京市电业局高压所西城变电站小组，由于小组工人认真执行苏联专家的建议，学习和贯彻了规程制度，创造了四百四十一天没有误操作的新纪录。
    根据很多参加北京市劳动模范代表大会的劳动模范来看，差不多都有几件到十几件技术革新和合理化建议，这对本单位生产起着很重要的作用。北京农业机械厂冯希谦改进了两种检验工具。该厂在过去每天要检验一万多个水车练环，需要十个检验工人，冯希谦创造了一种检验水车练环的工具，每天只用一个人就可以把一万多个水车练环检验完了。他还设计了一种检验收割机用的电传试验机。过去检验收割机需要牲畜拉着在地里试验，现在用他设计的电传试验机，不用牲畜，在厂房内就可以进行检验，缩短了检验的时间而又能准确的检验出收割机的性能和规格。人民电机厂青年扳筋工郑崇孝，创造八件做电扇网子用的工具，使产量提高了五倍半。还有琉璃河水泥厂制成车间机械员刘风，经常研究机器设备，进行改进。他在一年中实现了八项技术改进，仅二号选粉机和熟料破碎机两项改进计算，就为国家节省了四亿六千多万元。
