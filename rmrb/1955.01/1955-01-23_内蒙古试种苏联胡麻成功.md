Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region successfully trial-planted Soviet oil and fiber flax in Jining County last year. The Inner Mongolia region mostly plants oil flax, which has a low yield, and the fiber of the stalks cannot be utilized. Last year, Jining County began trial planting 300 mu of Soviet oil and fiber flax seeds, and a bumper harvest was generally achieved. In Da Liuhao Township, more than 100 mu were planted, with an average yield of 76 jin of oilseeds per mu, 31 jin more than local flax per mu. Each mu of flax stalks can also produce 30 jin of coarse fiber as raw material for the textile industry. Soviet flax seeds have a short growing period and mature 25 days earlier than local flax. Therefore, they can avoid the rainy season and early frost, and prevent or reduce rust damage, ensuring yield. After seeing the benefits of Soviet flax, farmers have requested a supply of improved varieties. The People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has now purchased 300,000 jin of Soviet flax seeds from Heilongjiang Province and is vigorously organizing farms and agricultural production cooperatives to propagate them, in preparation for expanding the planting area in the future.

    内蒙古试种苏联胡麻成功
    内蒙古自治区去年在集宁县试种苏联油麻两用胡麻获得成功。内蒙地区大都种植油用胡麻，产量很低，麻秆的纤维也不能利用。去年集宁县开始试种三百亩苏联油麻两用胡麻种，普遍获得丰收。大六号乡试种的一百多亩，平均每亩产油籽七十六斤，比当地胡麻每亩多收三十一斤，每亩胡麻秆还可制出三十斤粗纤维作纺织工业原料。苏联胡麻种生长期短，比当地胡麻早二十五天成熟，因此，可躲过雨季和早霜，避免或减少了锈病为害，产量有保证。农民看到苏联胡麻的好处后，纷纷要求供应良种。现内蒙古自治区人民政府已从黑龙江省购买回三十万斤苏联胡麻种，大力组织农场和农业生产合作社进行繁殖，为将来扩大种植面积作好准备。
