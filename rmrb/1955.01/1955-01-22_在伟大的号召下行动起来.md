Act Under the Great Call

The peace-loving people of the whole world can no longer tolerate the conspiracy of the American aggressor group to actively prepare for a large-scale, destructive atomic war. The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council held an enlarged meeting in Vienna, formulated the tasks of the peace movement in response to the decision of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council on the use of nuclear weapons, and called on all peace-loving forces to further develop the struggle against the ratification and implementation of the Paris Agreement, which aims to revive German militarism. This fully reflects the urgent demands of peace-loving mankind. Three important documents issued by the meeting, including the declaration, the letter to the people of Europe, and the letter to the people of the world, clearly pointed out to the people of the world the path to oppose the preparation of atomic war and ensure world peace and security. This is of great significance for further developing the world peace movement.

All the efforts made by peace-loving countries and people around the world to reach an agreement on the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons have been obstructed and sabotaged by the American aggressor group from the beginning. The American conspiracy of refusing to abandon the use of atomic weapons and actively preparing to launch an atomic war is now becoming clearer and clearer. The American aggressor group's plot to revive West German militarism through the Paris Agreement, to organize the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, and to continue to occupy our country's territory of Taiwan, is to intensify the tense situation in Europe and the Far East in order to facilitate its unbridled preparation for atomic war. In Europe, the American aggressor group and its followers intend to hand over atomic weapons to Hitler's executioners through the Paris Agreement. The North Atlantic aggressive bloc's Paris meeting approved the plan to prepare for atomic war in Europe and has in fact given American generals the right to arbitrarily decide on the use of atomic weapons. In the Far East, the American aggressor group is actively pursuing the establishment of atomic bombing bases on the chain of Pacific islands and is desperately increasing its naval and air forces. Recently, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, Radford, openly stated that once the Korean War resumes, the United States will use atomic weapons. The American aggressor group's clamor for atomic war has reached a state of madness.

The fact that the American aggressor group is preparing for atomic war is most blatantly revealed in Eisenhower's "Budget Message" of January 17. It is not without reason that the Associated Press calls this message the "atomic budget." According to this budget message, the United States government's military expenditure for the fiscal year 1956 accounts for two-thirds of the total budget, or $40.458 billion, and will be used directly for military purposes, with particular emphasis on expanding the atomic strike force of the United States armed forces. Eisenhower made no secret of the fact that this American military expansion plan "reflects the rapid technological development of the current nuclear and electronic age." From this fact alone, we can see the steps the American aggressor group is taking to step up preparations for atomic war.

Although the American aggressor group is no longer the monopolist of atomic energy, it still attempts to use these weapons of mass destruction to promote its neo-colonialism and to intimidate and blackmail the peace-loving people of the world. American monopoly capitalists regard the production of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons as a source of huge profits, and some people in the United States even believe that the production of these expensive weapons of mass destruction is an important means to avoid and alleviate economic crises. Sterling Cole, chairman of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy of the United States Congress, said long ago, "I don't think it's difficult to choose between financial collapse and atomic destruction in our country." Obviously, the American aggressor group has now increasingly clearly chosen the path of expanding atomic weapons.

Today, the people of all countries must assess the new threats posed by the United States' stepped-up military expansion and continuous development of weapons of mass destruction, thereby uniting more closely and fighting to the end to eliminate the threat of atomic war. As the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council pointed out: "The task is to eliminate the destruction, oppression, and suffering that come with it, to ensure that the people of all countries in the world can achieve independence and have the right to increase their own wealth and move together towards security and prosperity." In order to achieve this task, we must resolutely oppose the remilitarization of Germany, oppose American aggression in Asia, and transform the signature campaign to ban the use of atomic weapons into a powerful and genuine mass movement.

The struggle against atomic war and the demand that atomic energy be used only for peaceful purposes is increasingly becoming an important part of the peace movement of the people of all countries. In March 1950, the Executive Bureau of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress called for a campaign to sign the Stockholm Declaration banning atomic weapons, which received more than 500 million signatures in countries on all continents of the world. This is a strong expression of the will, conscience, and strength of the people. The movement launched by the people of all countries around this declaration has produced a significant effect, preventing the United States' arrogant attempt to use atomic bombs in Korea and Indochina. Subsequent facts have proved that the increasingly provocative actions of American atomic war advocates and organizers have aroused greater anger and more resolute struggle among the people of all countries.

Throughout the world, the people's struggle to demand the prohibition of atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs is now further developing into a powerful force that cannot be ignored. People cannot help but pay special attention to the fact that the Japanese people, who have suffered the scourge of atomic explosions three times, are bravely standing at the forefront of this just struggle. They will never forget Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 and the Fukuryu Maru incident in 1954, and they have used their painful experiences to accuse the United States of its criminal acts to the world. This is something that no person with a conscience can remain indifferent to. International public opinion has long pointed out that the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki cannot be regarded as military operations to strike at the main force of Japanese fascism, but rather as the beginning of the American atomic blackmail policy and the "Cold War" policy. And the serious harm suffered by the people of Hiroshima and other places from the American atomic bombs must not be allowed to be repeated under any circumstances; in order to prevent the recurrence of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki incidents, the movement of people of all strata in Japan demanding the prohibition of atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs has spread throughout the country. In the past six months, more than 20 million Japanese people have signed their names to demand the prohibition of atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs. The peaceful will demonstrated by the Japanese people is obviously also the common will of the peace-loving people of all of Asia and the world, and all upright people will fully support the struggle of the Japanese people.

The American atomic blackmail policy has also aroused resolute and unified opposition from other countries in Asia. Indian Prime Minister Nehru, in a statement on the issue of atomic weapons on April 2, 1954, said that "it is certainly not enough to feel uneasy," and that "resolute measures must be taken to prevent disaster." The communiqué of the Five-Nation Prime Ministers' Conference held in Bogor not long ago also reaffirmed their serious concern about the destructive potential of atomic weapons explosions.

The Soviet Union's development in the field of atomic energy and its persistence in the struggle to prohibit the use of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons are a powerful support for the world people's peace movement against the American atomic war plan. The Soviet Union expressed the true aspirations of the people of the world and repeatedly put forward proposals on the prohibition of atomic weapons in the United Nations, so that the discussions conducted by the United Nations in this regard were not buried by the United States' obstruction and sabotage policies. The joint proposal on disarmament and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction and the resolution on international cooperation in promoting the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, adopted by the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, are of certain significance. Recently, the Soviet Union has taken a more active attitude to carry out international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy. It is preparing to submit a report on this major issue at the international conference on the peaceful use of atomic energy to be held this year, and has decided to recommend assistance to our country and other people's democratic countries in the large-scale development of scientific research in atomic nuclear physics. All good people and scientists around the world unanimously support the Soviet Union's just struggle for the happiness of mankind and regard the path of international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy opened up by the Soviet Union as the only correct path that the people of the world must strive for with all their strength.

As the declaration of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council said: "The united action of the people of all countries can stop group politics. It can enable governments to negotiate on the issue of disarmament and the complete use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes." The 600 million Chinese people will resolutely support this call and take active and concrete actions. We believe that the people of the world will respond to the great call of the World Peace Council with the greatest determination and confidence, unite in action to defeat the conspiracy plan of atomic war, defend world peace, and use atomic energy to benefit mankind.

    在伟大的号召下行动起来
    全世界爱好和平人民对于美国侵略集团积极准备大规模毁灭性的原子战争的阴谋，早已不能容忍了。世界和平理事会常委会在维也纳举行扩大会议，针对北大西洋公约组织理事会关于采用核子武器的决定而制订了和平运动的任务，并号召一切爱好和平的力量，进一步开展反对批准和实施目的在于复活德国军国主义的巴黎协定的斗争，这完全反映了爱好和平人类的迫切要求。会议所发表的宣言、告欧洲人民书和告全世界人民书等三个重要文件，清楚地向世界人民指出了反对准备原子战争、保障世界和平安全的道路。这对于进一步开展世界保卫和平运动具有极重要的意义。
    世界爱好和平的国家和人民主张就无条件禁止原子武器取得协议所作的一切努力，一开始就遭到美国侵略集团的阻挠和破坏。美国这种拒绝放弃使用原子武器、积极准备发动原子战争的阴谋，现在是越来越看得清楚了。美国侵略集团策划复活西德军国主义的巴黎协定，组织东南亚侵略集团和继续侵占我国领土台湾，就是要加剧欧洲和远东的紧张局势，以便利于它放手准备原子战争的阴谋。在欧洲，美国侵略集团及其追随者打算通过巴黎协定把原子武器交给希特勒刽子手，北大西洋侵略集团理事会巴黎会议批准了准备在欧洲进行原子战争的计划，并且事实上已经给了美国将领任意决定使用原子武器的权利。在远东，美国侵略集团积极追求在太平洋岛屿锁链上建立原子轰炸基地，拼命增加海空军势力；最近美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福公开声言，一旦朝鲜战争恢复，美国就要使用原子武器。美国侵略集团进行原子战争的叫嚷，已经达到了疯狂的地步。
    美国侵略集团进行原子战争准备的事实，在艾森豪威尔一月十七日的“预算咨文”中，也表现得最露骨不过了。美联社把这个咨文叫“原子预算”，不是没有道理的。根据这个预算咨文，美国政府一九五六年度的军事费用占全部预算的三分之二，即四百零四亿五千八百万美元，将直接用于军事目的，并将特别侧重在扩充美国武装部队的原子攻击力量。艾森豪威尔毫不掩饰地说，美国这个扩军计划“反映现在核子和电子时代的迅速的技术发展”。单从这个事实来看，就可以知道美国侵略集团加紧准备原子战争的步骤了。
    美国侵略集团虽然早已不是原子能的垄断者，但它们还企图利用这些大规模毁灭性武器来推行它的新殖民主义，对世界爱好和平的人民进行恫吓和讹诈。美国垄断资本家把生产原子武器和氢武器，当做他们获取巨额利润的来源，美国某些方面的人士甚至认为，生产这些价值昂贵的大规模毁灭性的武器，是避免和缓和经济危机的重要手段。美国国会原子能联合委员会主席史脱令·寇尔早就说过，“我想在我国遭受财政的崩溃和原子的摧毁之间作选择是并不困难的”。显然，美国侵略集团现在已经日益明显地选择了扩张原子武器的途径。
    今天，各国人民必须估计到美国加紧扩军和不断发展大规模毁灭性武器所造成的新威胁，从而更加团结起来，为消除原子战争威胁而斗争到底。正如世界和平理事会常委会所指出的：“任务是排除随之而来的毁灭、压迫和痛苦，以保证全世界各国人民能够得到独立，并且有权增进他们自己的财富，一同走向安全和繁荣”。为了实现这个任务，我们要坚决反对德国重新军国主义化，反对美国在亚洲的侵略活动，把禁止使用原子武器的签名运动形成为强大的真正的群众运动。
    反对原子战争、要求原子能只许用于和平用途的斗争，日益成为各国人民保卫和平运动的重要环节。一九五○年三月，世界和平大会常设委员会执行局号召在禁止原子武器的斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名的运动，曾在世界各大洲的国家内得到了五亿以上人的签名。这是人民的意志、良心和力量的坚强表现。各国人民围绕这一宣言而展开的运动，产生了重大的作用，制止了美国在朝鲜和印度支那使用原子弹的狂妄企图。以后的事实证明，美国原子战争鼓吹者和组织者变本加厉的挑衅行动，引起了各国人民更大的愤怒和更坚决的斗争。
    在全世界，人民要求禁止原子弹和氢弹的斗争，现在正进一步发展成为不可忽视的强大力量。人们不能不特别注意到，曾经三次遭受原子爆炸祸害的日本人民，正勇敢地站到这个正义斗争的前列。他们永远不能忘记一九四五年的广岛和长崎以及一九五四年的福龙丸事件，并以沉痛的经历向世界控诉了美国的犯罪行为。这是任何一个有良心的人都不能无动于衷的。国际舆论早已指出，在广岛和长崎投下的原子弹，并不能看作是为了打击日本法西斯主力的军事行动，而是美国原子讹诈政策和“冷战”政策的开始。而广岛等地人民所经受的美国原子弹的严重危害，是无论如何不能让它重演的；为了制止广岛和长崎事件的重演，日本各阶层人民要求禁止原子弹和氢弹的运动已经遍及全国。半年来，日本人民签名要求禁止原子弹和氢弹者已达两千多万人。日本人民所表现的这种和平意志，显然也是全亚洲和全世界和平人民的共同意志，一切正直的人民都将全力支持日本人民的斗争。
    美国的原子讹诈政策，同样引起亚洲其他国家坚决一致的反对。印度总理尼赫鲁在一九五四年四月二日曾就原子武器问题发表声明说，“仅仅感到不安当然是不够的”，必须“采取坚决的措施，以防止灾祸”。不久以前在茂物举行的南亚五国总理会议公报，也重申了他们对于原子武器爆炸的毁灭性潜力的严重关切。
    苏联在原子能方面的发展和坚持禁止使用原子武器和氢武器的斗争，是对世界人民反对美国原子战争计划的和平运动的有力支持。苏联表达了全世界人民的真正愿望，在联合国一再提出关于禁止原子武器的建议，使得联合国在这方面进行的讨论，没有被美国的阻挠和破坏政策所葬送。联合国大会第九届会议通过的关于裁军和禁止大规模毁灭性武器的问题的联合提案、关于在促进原子能用于和平目的方面进行国际合作的决议，都具有一定的意义。最近苏联更采取了积极的态度，来开展和平利用原子能的国际合作。它准备在今年召开的和平利用原子能国际会议上就这一重大问题提出报告，同时决定建议帮助我国和其他人民民主国家大规模地发展原子核物理的科学研究工作。全世界所有善良的人民和科学家，都一致支持苏联为了人类的幸福而进行的这一正义斗争，并把苏联所打开的和平利用原子能的国际合作的道路，看成是全世界人民必须全力争取的唯一正确的道路。
    正如世界和平理事会常委会宣言中所说：“各国人民的联合行动能够制止集团政策。它能够使得各国政府就裁减军备问题和把核子能完全用于和平目的问题进行谈判。”六亿的中国人民将坚决支持这个号召，并积极采取具体的行动。我们相信，全世界人民一定会以最大的决心和信心响应世界和平理事会的伟大号召，一致行动起来，击败原子战争的阴谋计划，捍卫世界和平，并把原子能用来造福于人类。
