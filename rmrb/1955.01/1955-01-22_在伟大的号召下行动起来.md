Act Under the Great Call

The peace-loving people of the whole world can no longer tolerate the conspiracy of the American aggressor group to actively prepare for a large-scale, destructive atomic war. The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council held an enlarged meeting in Vienna, formulated the tasks of the peace movement in response to the decision of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council on the use of nuclear weapons, and called on all peace-loving forces to further develop the struggle against the ratification and implementation of the Paris Agreement, which aims to revive German militarism. This fully reflects the urgent demands of peace-loving mankind. Three important documents issued by the meeting, including the declaration, the letter to the people of Europe, and the letter to the people of the world, clearly pointed out to the people of the world the path to oppose the preparation of atomic war and ensure world peace and security. This is of great significance for further developing the world peace movement.

All the efforts made by peace-loving countries and people around the world to reach an agreement on the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons have been obstructed and sabotaged by the American aggressor group from the beginning. The American conspiracy of refusing to abandon the use of atomic weapons and actively preparing to launch an atomic war is now becoming clearer and clearer. The American aggressor group's plot to revive West German militarism through the Paris Agreement, to organize the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, and to continue to occupy our country's territory of Taiwan, is to intensify the tense situation in Europe and the Far East in order to facilitate its unbridled preparation for atomic war. In Europe, the American aggressor group and its followers intend to hand over atomic weapons to Hitler's executioners through the Paris Agreement. The North Atlantic aggressive bloc's Paris meeting approved the plan to prepare for atomic war in Europe and has in fact given American generals the right to arbitrarily decide on the use of atomic weapons. In the Far East, the American aggressor group is actively pursuing the establishment of atomic bombing bases on the chain of Pacific islands and is desperately increasing its naval and air forces. Recently, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, Radford, openly stated that once the Korean War resumes, the United States will use atomic weapons. The American aggressor group's clamor for atomic war has reached a state of madness.

The fact that the American aggressor group is preparing for atomic war is most blatantly revealed in Eisenhower's "Budget Message" of January 17. It is not without reason that the Associated Press calls this message the "atomic budget." According to this budget message, the United States government's military expenditure for the fiscal year 1956 accounts for two-thirds of the total budget, or $40.458 billion, and will be used directly for military purposes, with particular emphasis on expanding the atomic strike force of the United States armed forces. Eisenhower made no secret of the fact that this American military expansion plan "reflects the rapid technological development of the current nuclear and electronic age." From this fact alone, we can see the steps the American aggressor group is taking to step up preparations for atomic war.

Although the American aggressor group is no longer the monopolist of atomic energy, it still attempts to use these weapons of mass destruction to promote its neo-colonialism and to intimidate and blackmail the peace-loving people of the world. American monopoly capitalists regard the production of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons as a source of huge profits, and some people in the United States even believe that the production of these expensive weapons of mass destruction is an important means to avoid and alleviate economic crises. Sterling Cole, chairman of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy of the United States Congress, said long ago, "I don't think it's difficult to choose between financial collapse and atomic destruction in our country." Obviously, the American aggressor group has now increasingly clearly chosen the path of expanding atomic weapons.

Today, the people of all countries must assess the new threats posed by the United States' stepped-up military expansion and continuous development of weapons of mass destruction, thereby uniting more closely and fighting to the end to eliminate the threat of atomic war. As the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council pointed out: "The task is to eliminate the destruction, oppression, and suffering that come with it, to ensure that the people of all countries in the world can achieve independence and have the right to increase their own wealth and move together towards security and prosperity." In order to achieve this task, we must resolutely oppose the remilitarization of Germany, oppose American aggression in Asia, and transform the signature campaign to ban the use of atomic weapons into a powerful and genuine mass movement.

The struggle against atomic war and the demand that atomic energy be used only for peaceful purposes is increasingly becoming an important part of the peace movement of the people of all countries. In March 1950, the Executive Bureau of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress called for a campaign to sign the Stockholm Declaration banning atomic weapons, which received more than 500 million signatures in countries on all continents of the world. This is a strong expression of the will, conscience, and strength of the people. The movement launched by the people of all countries around this declaration has produced a significant effect, preventing the United States' arrogant attempt to use atomic bombs in Korea and Indochina. Subsequent facts have proved that the increasingly provocative actions of American atomic war advocates and organizers have aroused greater anger and more resolute struggle among the people of all countries.

Throughout the world, the people's struggle to demand the prohibition of atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs is now further developing into a powerful force that cannot be ignored. People cannot help but pay special attention to the fact that the Japanese people, who have suffered the scourge of atomic explosions three times, are bravely standing at the forefront of this just struggle. They will never forget Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 and the Fukuryu Maru incident in 1954, and they have used their painful experiences to accuse the United States of its criminal acts to the world. This is something that no person with a conscience can remain indifferent to. International public opinion has long pointed out that the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki cannot be regarded as military operations to strike at the main force of Japanese fascism, but rather as the beginning of the American atomic blackmail policy and the "Cold War" policy. And the serious harm suffered by the people of Hiroshima and other places from the American atomic bombs must not be allowed to be repeated under any circumstances; in order to prevent the recurrence of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki incidents, the movement of people of all strata in Japan demanding the prohibition of atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs has spread throughout the country. In the past six months, more than 20 million Japanese people have signed their names to demand the prohibition of atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs. The peaceful will demonstrated by the Japanese people is obviously also the common will of the peace-loving people of all of Asia and the world, and all upright people will fully support the struggle of the Japanese people.

The American atomic blackmail policy has also aroused resolute and unified opposition from other countries in Asia. Indian Prime Minister Nehru, in a statement on the issue of atomic weapons on April 2, 1954, said that "it is certainly not enough to feel uneasy," and that "resolute measures must be taken to prevent disaster." The communiqu√© of the Five-Nation Prime Ministers' Conference held in Bogor not long ago also reaffirmed their serious concern about the destructive potential of atomic weapons explosions.

The Soviet Union's development in the field of atomic energy and its persistence in the struggle to prohibit the use of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons are a powerful support for the world people's peace movement against the American atomic war plan. The Soviet Union expressed the true aspirations of the people of the world and repeatedly put forward proposals on the prohibition of atomic weapons in the United Nations, so that the discussions conducted by the United Nations in this regard were not buried by the United States' obstruction and sabotage policies. The joint proposal on disarmament and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction and the resolution on international cooperation in promoting the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, adopted by the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, are of certain significance. Recently, the Soviet Union has taken a more active attitude to carry out international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy. It is preparing to submit a report on this major issue at the international conference on the peaceful use of atomic energy to be held this year, and has decided to recommend assistance to our country and other people's democratic countries in the large-scale development of scientific research in atomic nuclear physics. All good people and scientists around the world unanimously support the Soviet Union's just struggle for the happiness of mankind and regard the path of international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy opened up by the Soviet Union as the only correct path that the people of the world must strive for with all their strength.

As the declaration of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council said: "The united action of the people of all countries can stop group politics. It can enable governments to negotiate on the issue of disarmament and the complete use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes." The 600 million Chinese people will resolutely support this call and take active and concrete actions. We believe that the people of the world will respond to the great call of the World Peace Council with the greatest determination and confidence, unite in action to defeat the conspiracy plan of atomic war, defend world peace, and use atomic energy to benefit mankind.
