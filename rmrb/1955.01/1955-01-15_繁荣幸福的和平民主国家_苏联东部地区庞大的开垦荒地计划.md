    Prosperous, Happy, and Peaceful Democratic Countries
    The Soviet Union's Immense Plan to Reclaim Wasteland in the Eastern Region

    This year, the Soviet Union's eastern reclamation areas will implement an immense plan to reclaim wasteland, and the work of Machine Tractor Stations will be further strengthened. According to A. Shibanov, Deputy Director of the Main Administration of Machine Tractor Stations of the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture, to a TASS reporter:

    This year, more than 1,000 Machine Tractor Stations in Kazakhstan, Siberia, the Urals, and the Volga River Basin will help collective farmers sow more than 11 million hectares of newly reclaimed land. State farms in these areas are reclaiming large amounts of wasteland. A total of 18 million to 20 million hectares of newly reclaimed land will be sown with wheat and other crops. In addition, there are plans to reclaim 10 million hectares of virgin land this year for sowing next year.

    State farms and Machine Tractor Stations in the Soviet Union's eastern reclamation areas are receiving first-class machinery. This year, they will receive 98,000 new tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower), 26,000 grain harvesting combines, and hundreds of thousands of other new-style machines and farm implements for cultivation and sowing. The Machine Tractor Stations will also receive more than 10,000 plows specially designed for cultivating land using the Maltsev method.

    Because the reclamation task is very heavy, the work of Machine Tractor Stations in the eastern regions will be thoroughly improved this year. Large-scale basic construction is now underway at 350 Machine Tractor Stations. They are building well-equipped workshops, power stations, reservoirs, and fully equipped residential areas with surrounding orchards. This year, the funds used for the basic construction of Machine Tractor Stations will reach 1.5 billion rubles.

    苏联东部地区庞大的开垦荒地计划
    今年，苏联东部开垦地区将执行一个庞大的开垦荒地的计划，机器拖拉机站的工作将进一步加强。据苏联农业部机器拖拉机站管理总署副署长阿·希巴诺夫对塔斯社记者说：
    今年，哈萨克、西伯利亚、乌拉尔和伏尔加河流域的一千多个机器拖拉机站，将帮助集体农民播种一千一百多万公顷新开垦的土地。这些地方的国营农场正在开垦大量的荒地。总共有一千八百万到两千万公顷新开垦的土地将播种小麦和其他作物。此外，今年还计划开垦一千万公顷明年播种用的生荒地。
    苏联东部开垦地区的国营农场和机器拖拉机站正在得到头等的机器。今年，它们将得到九万八千台新的拖拉机（每台以十五匹马力计算），二万六千台谷物收割联合机和几十万台其他耕地和播种用的新式机器和农具。机器拖拉机站还将得到一万多个专门用马尔采夫耕作法耕地的犁。
    由于开垦任务很繁重，今年要彻底改进东部地区的机器拖拉机站的工作。有三百五十个机器拖拉机站现在正在进行大规模的基本建设。它们正在建设设备很好的车间、电力站、水库和周围有果园的设备齐全的住宅区。今年，用于机器拖拉机站的基本建设的经费将达到十五亿卢布。
