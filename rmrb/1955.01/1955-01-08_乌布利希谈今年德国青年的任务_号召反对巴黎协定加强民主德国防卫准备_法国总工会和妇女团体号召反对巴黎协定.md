    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 7th: The "Young World," the organ of the Free German Youth League, published on the 5th a statement by Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, to the newspaper regarding the tasks of German youth in 1955.

    Ulbricht pointed out that courageously implementing the resolutions of the Third Youth Congress of the West German Trade Union Federation and the Third Congress of the West German Trade Union Federation against German militarization is the most important contribution of West German youth to the restoration of German unity. The slogan put forward by the West German Trade Union Federation and West German youth of "not a man, not a penny" to support re-militarization should be put into practical action.

    Ulbricht called on all youth in West Berlin and West Germany to recognize that the Paris Accords and the re-militarization of Germany are hindering German unity and threatening the lives of West German youth and the people. Ulbricht pointed out that young workers, who play a decisive role and are the most politically conscious, have a major task in this struggle.

    Ulbricht said that the task of the young workers of the German Democratic Republic is to strive to make 1955 the year of the victorious completion of the first Five-Year Plan. Young workers should master technology, learn advanced production methods, and launch socialist competitions.

    Ulbricht then spoke about the work of the Free German Youth League. He said that strengthening ideological education for youth is the most important task of the Free German Youth League. The general guideline of this organization should be to establish patriotic unity in action among young people, defend all the achievements of the worker-peasant government, and help strengthen the defense capabilities of the German Democratic Republic. He said: "If the West German militarists know that the German Democratic Republic is a strong country, and that all the countries participating in the Moscow Conference are fully prepared, so that the enemy has no possibility of a surprise attack, then the Adenauer government and his Hitlerite generals will have to think carefully before taking risks. Therefore, it is necessary to oppose pacifist ideas that weaken our republic's defense preparations. The principled distinction between the state's armed forces and militarism must be systematically explained to young people. At the same time, the education of young people in proletarian internationalism should also be strengthened."

    Xinhua News Agency, January 7th: TASS, Paris, January 6th: The Executive Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor issued a statement, reiterating the threat posed by the Paris Accords to France. The statement said: These agreements were approved by a minority of members of the National Assembly. These agreements carry the danger of dragging France into an aggressive war of revenge that the West German militarist bloc is determined to launch.

    The statement said: "The Executive Bureau of the General Confederation of Labor urges everyone to pay attention to the fact that the result of ratifying the Paris Accords will be that France will lose its last bit of national independence."

    The Executive Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor reiterated that the implementation of the Paris Accords would intensify the arms race, thereby worsening the situation of the working people. The Executive Bureau expressed its belief that there is still an opportunity to prevent the final ratification of the Paris Accords. The Executive Bureau called on the French working people to demand that the members of the Senate of the Republic come out against the ratification of the Paris Accords, and called on the working people to strengthen the struggle against arming West Germany.

    Xinhua News Agency, January 7th: According to TASS, Paris, January 6th: "L'Humanité" published a letter of appeal from the French Women's Action Committee Against the Revival of German Militarism. The committee called on French women to hold rallies in cities and villages across the country on January 30th to protest the arming of West Germany and demand the prohibition of atomic weapons and universal disarmament.

    The appeal called on French women who desire peace to unite, and pointed out that uniting can influence the government's decision on the revival of German militarism.

    The appeal also called on French women to unite for the sake of their families, children, better living conditions, happiness and peace, and to reiterate their unwavering will to reduce armaments so that mankind's best inventions and discoveries can serve life rather than death, making January 30, 1955 a day of national women's struggle for disarmament.

    The appeal was signed by: the wife of the late General Delestraint, Madame Vaillant-Couturier, Geneva Blanqui, professor at the University of Dijon, Madame Bellini, mother of Danielle Casanova, a French national heroine who died in the struggle against the Nazi invaders, and the wives of many French patriots who sacrificed themselves in the struggle against Nazi aggressors.

    乌布利希谈今年德国青年的任务
    号召反对巴黎协定加强民主德国防卫准备
    法国总工会和妇女团体号召反对巴黎协定
    【新华社柏林七日电】自由德国青年联盟机关报“青年世界报”五日刊载了德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希就一九五五年德国青年的任务问题向该报发表的谈话。
    乌布利希指出：勇敢地执行西德工会联合会第三届青年代表大会和西德工会联合会第三次代表大会反对德国军国主义化的决议，就是西德青年对恢复德国统一的最重要的贡献。西德工会联合会和西德青年提出的不出一个人、不用一分钱来支持重新军国主义化的口号，应该贯彻到实际行动中去。
    乌布利希号召西柏林和西德的一切青年认清巴黎协定和德国的重新军国主义化阻碍德国的统一，并且威胁着西德青年和人民的生活。乌布利希指出：在青年中有决定性作用和最觉悟的青年工人，在这个斗争中负有重大任务。
    乌布利希说：德意志民主共和国的青年工人的任务是：努力使一九五五年成为第一个五年计划胜利完成的一年。青年工人应该掌握技术，学习先进的生产方法，展开社会主义竞赛。
    乌布利希接着谈到自由德国青年联盟的工作。他说，加强对青年的思想教育工作是自由德国青年联盟最主要的任务。这个组织的总的活动方针，应该是在青年中建立爱国主义的统一行动，保卫工农政权的一切成就，帮助增强德意志民主共和国的防卫力量。他说：“如果西德军国主义者知道德意志民主共和国是一个强有力的国家，知道一切参加莫斯科会议的国家都有充分准备，使敌人没有突袭的可能，那么，阿登纳政府和他的希特勒将领们在冒险之前，就不得不好好考虑。因此，必须反对使我们共和国的防卫准备减弱的和平主义思想。必须在青年中有系统地解释国家的武装力量和军国主义之间的原则性区别。同时，也应该加强对青年的无产阶级国际主义的教育。”
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社巴黎六日讯：法国总工会执行局发表声明，再度强调巴黎协定对法国的威胁。声明说：这些协定是国民议会的少数议员批准的。这些协定有把法国拖入西德军国主义集团一心想发动的侵略性复仇战争中去的危险。
    声明说：“总工会执行局要促请大家注意：批准巴黎协定结果会使法国失去它的最后一点点民族独立。”
    法国总工会执行局再度强调指出：实施巴黎协定就会使军备竞赛加紧，从而使劳动人民的处境恶化。　　执行局表示相信还有机会来阻止巴黎协定的最后批准。执行局号召法国劳动人民要求共和国参议院议员们出来反对批准巴黎协定，并且号召劳动人民加强反对武装西德的斗争。
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社巴黎六日讯：“人道报”发表了法国妇女反对德国军国主义复活行动委员会的呼吁书。委员会号召法国妇女在一月三十日在全国各城市和乡村举行集会，抗议武装西德，要求禁止原子武器和普遍裁减军备。
    呼吁书号召渴望和平的法国妇女团结起来，并且指出：团结起来，就能够影响政府关于复活德国军国主义的决定。
    呼吁书还号召法国妇女团结起来，为了家庭、儿童、较好的生活条件、幸福和和平，为了使人类最好的发明和发现能够为生活服务而不为死亡服务，重申主张裁减军备的不屈不挠的意志，使得一九五五年一月三十日变成全国妇女争取裁减军备斗争日。
    在呼吁书上签名的有：已故的德勒斯特兰将军的夫人，瓦扬—古久里夫人，狄戎大学教授日纳维埃夫·布朗基，法国民族女英雄丹尼勒·加桑诺瓦的母亲贝里尼夫人以及在反对纳粹侵略者的斗争中牺牲的许多法国爱国者的妻子。
