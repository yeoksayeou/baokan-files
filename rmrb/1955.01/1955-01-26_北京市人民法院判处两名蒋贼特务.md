    Beijing People's Court Sentences Two Chiang Kai-shek Spies
    [This newspaper] Beijing News: On the 21st, the Beijing People's Court publicly tried Wang Xuexian and Zhu Kechang, two spies from the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's spy organization sent from Hong Kong to Beijing to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. Hundreds of cadres from various factories and mines in Beijing attended the hearing.
    The defendant Wang Xuexian joined the Chiang Kai-shek "Ministry of Interior Investigation Bureau" spy organization in Hong Kong and received training in spy activities such as "secret writing." The Chiang Kai-shek spy organization designated him with the alias Zhang Zhong and the special agent code name "308." His task was to collect intelligence, primarily on factory production and machinery equipment. In 1953, under the guise of returning to the country to participate in construction, the defendant Wang sneaked back into the country and worked at the Beijing Fine Arts Printing Factory. The defendant Wang confessed that from May 1953 to July 1954, he sent more than 20 pieces of intelligence to the Chiang Kai-shek spy agency in Hong Kong, including information on the machinery equipment and production of the Beijing Fine Arts Printing Factory, the names of department heads, the number of guards and weapons, etc. He also spread rumors within the factory, attempting to incite antagonism between backward workers and factory leaders, and to undermine worker morale. The defendant Wang's counter-revolutionary actions of pledging allegiance to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique were valued by the Chiang Kai-shek spy organization, which successively issued him HK$700 in special agent activity funds.
    The defendant Zhu Kechang joined the Chiang Kai-shek spy organization "Anti-Communist and Resist Russia Youth League" in Hong Kong in 1952, serving as a deputy district team leader. In 1953, he joined the Chiang Kai-shek spy organization "Bureau of Investigation and Statistics," using the aliases Zhu Ming and Hu Mingxi. The defendant Zhu received special agent training in how to consolidate organizations, feign progress, collect intelligence, and conduct secret communications. When he sneaked back into the country, he carried with him "secret writing" and developing chemicals, as well as codes for secret communications. His task was to go to Beijing to gather military intelligence and develop a spy organization. After sneaking back into the country, the defendant Zhu actively sought legal employment, and later contacted the defendant Wang Xuexian, who was lurking in the Beijing Fine Arts Printing Factory. In April 1954, Zhu managed to work at the Beijing Pushan Printing Factory. After arriving in Beijing, the defendant Zhu used secret writing codes to report to the Chiang Kai-shek spy agency in Hong Kong and requested special agent funds. The defendant Zhu received HK$600 in special agent activity funds.
    After the spy activities of the two defendants, Wang and Zhu, were uncovered by our People's Public Security organs, the Beijing People's Procuratorate conducted investigations in accordance with the law and filed a public prosecution with the Beijing People's Court.
    At the public trial, the defendants Wang and Zhu pleaded guilty in the face of irrefutable evidence. During the public trial, the Beijing People's Court granted them the right to defense in accordance with the law, and appointed two public defenders to provide full defense. After the trial was concluded, the Beijing People's Court, in accordance with Article 6, Paragraph 1, and Article 7, Paragraph 1, of the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries," sentenced the Chiang Kai-shek spy Wang Xuexian to death with a two-year reprieve, and Zhu Kechang to life imprisonment.

    王、朱两犯的特务活动经我人民公安机关破获后，北京市人民检察院依法进行了侦讯，并向北京市人民法院提起公诉。
    在公判庭上，王、朱两犯在无可辩驳的证据面前已低头认罪。北京市人民法院在公审过程中，依法给予了他们辩护权，指定两个公设辩护人，进行了充分的辩护。审理终结以后，北京市人民法院依照“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例”第六条第一款和第七条第一款的规定，判处蒋贼特务王学贤死刑，缓期二年执行，朱克昌无期徒刑。
