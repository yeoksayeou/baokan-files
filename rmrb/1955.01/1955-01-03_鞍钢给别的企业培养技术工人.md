Anshan Iron and Steel Company (Ansteel) has trained more than 1,600 technical workers for units such as the First Automobile Works, Benxi Iron and Steel Company, and Jilin Construction Company since May 1953. According to the requirements of the commissioning units, Ansteel assigned the workers who came to the company for training to the relevant factories, with the largest number going to the large-scale mechanized and automated rolling mills, seamless steel pipe plants, and the Second Thin Plate Plant. The factories mainly adopted methods such as master-apprentice contracts and organizing spare-time technical training classes for cultivation. Because these workers studied hard and the factories attached importance to this work, and the masters patiently taught the technology, many trainees have acquired certain technical abilities, and some can master the control panel. When they return to their posts, they will be able to operate independently.

    鞍钢给别的企业培养技术工人
    鞍山钢铁公司从一九五三年五月开始到现在，先后给第一汽车制造厂、本溪钢铁公司、吉林建设公司等单位培养了一千六百多名技术工人。鞍山钢铁公司按委托单位的要求，把来公司学习的工人分配到各有关厂培养，其中到机械化自动化的大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂和第二薄板厂的最多。各厂主要是采取师徒合同和组织业余技术训练班等方式进行培养。由于这些工人努力学习和各厂重视这一工作，师傅耐心教给技术，很多学员都具备了一定的技术能力，有的能够掌握操纵台了。他们回到自己的工作岗位时，将能独立地进行操作。
