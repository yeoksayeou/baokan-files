Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, January 19th: Syrian Prime Minister Fares al-Khoury told reporters that he had accepted Egypt's invitation to attend the Arab Prime Ministers' meeting in Cairo on January 22 to discuss the Turkish-Iraqi treaty. He said that his attitude at this meeting would be consistent with his previous statements regarding the implementation of a neutral policy and not participating in any foreign conventions. Khoury said that if his government planned to make any changes in its foreign policy, such changes would be submitted to parliament for approval.

It is reported that Khoury met with Abdul Aziz bin Said, the Saudi Arabian ambassador to Syria, on January 17. According to political figures in Damascus, Said informed the Syrian Prime Minister that Saudi Arabia opposed the Turkish-Iraqi treaty.

News from Amman says that Jordanian newspapers are fiercely criticizing the Turkish-Iraqi treaty. They believe that this treaty is an attempt by Turkey and Iraq to undermine the unity of Arab countries and drag them into the imperialist military alliances of Western countries. "Al-Jabhah Weekly" said that the treaty was "a stab in the back of the Arabs," and that the intention of the treaty was to "weaken the Arab League."

Well-informed sources in Damascus say that the purpose of British support for the Turkish-Iraqi treaty (albeit cautious support) is to seriously undermine American influence in Arab countries, as it clearly understands that Arab countries will undermine this plan initiated by the United States through Turkey. One point being emphasized here is that although Jordan is completely dependent on Britain, it fiercely opposes the Turkish-Iraqi treaty.

Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, January 19th: According to the Iranian newspaper "Jahan," the Director of the Press Department of the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Meikadeh, told a "Jahan" reporter: "The Iranian government does not currently intend to join the Middle East Defense Alliance and similar defense alliances, nor does it intend to join the Karachi-Ankara Military Convention."

"Jahan" continued: "Regarding the military convention that Iraq and Turkey agreed to conclude this week, according to Meikadeh, this convention is similar to the Turkish-Pakistani convention, and the Iranian government will not participate in this convention."

    叙利亚等国反对土耳其—伊拉克军事条约
    伊朗政府发言人说伊朗目前不参加土巴协定
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社大马士革十九日讯：叙利亚总理法雷斯·扈利对新闻记者说，他已接受埃及的建议，要出席一月二十二日在开罗召开的讨论土耳其—伊克拉条约的阿拉伯国家总理会议。他说，他在这个会议上的态度，将和他以前所发表的关于实行中立政策以及不参加任何外国公约的政策的声明是一致的。扈利说，如果他的政府计划在它的对外政策方面作任何改变的话，这种改变将提交议会批准。
    据报道，扈利一月十七日和沙特阿拉伯驻叙利亚大使阿卜杜勒·阿齐兹·本·赛义德会谈。据大马士革政界人士指出，赛义德曾通知叙利亚总理，沙特阿拉伯反对土耳其—伊拉克条约。
    来自安曼的消息说，约旦各报都对土耳其—伊拉克条约进行激烈的抨击。它们认为这个条约是土耳其和伊拉克企图破坏阿拉伯国家的团结并把它们拖进西方国家的帝国主义军事联盟。“阵线周刊”说，这个条约是对“阿拉伯人背后刺了一刀”，并且说，这个条约的意图是“削弱阿拉伯联盟”。
    大马士革的消息灵通人士说，英国支持土耳其—伊拉克条约（虽然是审慎地支持）的目的，是要严重地破坏美国在阿拉伯国家中的影响，因为它清楚地了解到，阿拉伯国家将破坏这个由美国通过土耳其所策动的计划。此间正在强调的一点是，虽然约旦是完全依赖着英国的，但是它激烈反对土耳其—伊拉克条约。
      【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社德黑兰十九日讯：据伊朗“世界报”报道，伊朗外交部新闻处处长梅依卡德对“世界报”记者说：“伊朗政府目前不打算加入中东防御同盟和类似的防御同盟，也不打算加入喀喇蚩—安卡拉军事公约。”
      “世界报”继续说：“关于伊拉克和土耳其在这个星期中同意缔结的军事公约，据梅依卡德说，这个公约和土巴公约类似，伊朗政府将不参加这个公约。”
