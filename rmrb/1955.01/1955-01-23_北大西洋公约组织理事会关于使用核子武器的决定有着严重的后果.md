    The North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council's Decision to Use Nuclear Weapons Has Grave Consequences
    E. Buropu, Professor of Nuclear Physics, University of London
    At the December Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Alliance Council, the ministers adopted decisions regarding the use of nuclear weapons, which are not good omens for the people of Europe and the world. The ministers unanimously agreed that future military plans of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will be based on the use of nuclear weapons.
    Before the agreement was reached, activities were carried out for a period of time to "weaken public resistance." The "mad talk" painstakingly concocted by Gruenther and Montgomery was intended to accustom the people of Western Europe to the idea of ​​such policies. As a result, the public's reaction to this appalling conspiracy was not as sharp as it should have been.
    Nevertheless, Gruenther and Montgomery's statements aroused unease in many countries. In Great Britain, Labour MPs have repeatedly asked Churchill and Eden to explain how much these statements represented the official position, but the answers received have always been evasive.
    Needless to say, they are trying to conceal the real consequences of these decisions. They do their best to make these decisions less condemned by public opinion. Some people insist that although the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's war plans should be based on the use of nuclear weapons, the real power to decide whether to use such weapons is in the hands of civilian personnel.
    But it is not difficult to expose such unfounded claims. The armed forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are preparing for a war based on the use of atomic and thermonuclear weapons.
    Suppose that the power to decide whether or not to use such weapons is in the hands of the political authorities for a certain period of time. However, after the December Paris meeting, the political authorities all agreed to the use of such weapons. Under the current situation, the political authorities will be powerless to change these decisions in wartime.
    The statement that these plans will only be implemented when attacked will not reassure the people of Europe. It should be known that the Korean War was also carried out under the banner of "defending against aggression." The majority of delegates to the United Nations General Assembly took Syngman Rhee's lies as proof that South Korea appeared to be a victim of aggression. Within the Western camp, there are those who can only see the prospect of war. The war crises caused by the activities of these people are very real. The resolutions of the North Atlantic Alliance Council meeting not long ago made us believe that such a war may be a comprehensive war, a war using weapons of mass destruction.
    Some people, including Dulles himself, are trying to reassure the people of Europe and make them believe that the new plans of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization only stipulate the tactical use of nuclear weapons, not the strategic use. However, such a distinction is only formal and loses any meaning when it comes to weapons with enormous destructive power.
    When war occurs, the "tactical" use of nuclear weapons as prescribed by Western countries will result in the large-scale death of Europeans. To complete "tactical" flight missions, planes for dropping atomic bombs will take off from airfields in Western Europe, especially Great Britain. As soon as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization starts using this weapon, all residents of Western Europe will be in great danger. Therefore, there is no practical possibility to limit this weapon to tactical activities against troops on the battlefield.
    The resolutions of the December North Atlantic Alliance Council meeting made it more difficult to reach an agreement on disarmament and the prohibition of nuclear weapons. Because the operational plans, the organization of the army, and even the deployment of the army are determined by the use of nuclear weapons, it is obvious that the military strategists of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will be more intense in opposing the prohibition of the use of this weapon.
    These decisions are being adopted at a time when the United Nations General Assembly has unanimously endorsed the call for major powers to continue discussions on disarmament and the supervision of atomic weapons on the basis of agreements reached, thus making it more likely to reach an agreement on this issue now than at any time after the war.
    However, it must not be forgotten that the measures taken to arm West Germany and bring West Germany into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are intended to allow the former Nazi officers to use nuclear weapons, most of whom hope to launch a war of revenge.
    The people of Western European countries are capable of tearing up the aggressive plans of the participating countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and reaching an agreement on disarmament and the prohibition of nuclear weapons. The most important task of the current peace movement is to make the people of all countries aware of all the dangers arising from the Paris resolutions and to organize a resolute struggle against the implementation of these decisions.

### 北大西洋公约组织理事会关于使用核子武器的决定有着严重的后果

    北大西洋公约组织理事会关于使用核子武器的决定有着严重的后果
    伦敦大学核子物理学教授  埃·布罗普
    在北大西洋联盟理事会十二月巴黎会议上，部长们通过了关于使用核子武器的决定，这些决定对于欧洲和全世界的人民都不是好的征兆。部长们一致同意今后北大西洋公约组织的军事计划将以使用核子武器为基础。
    在达成协议以前，为了“减弱公众的反抗情绪”，曾进行了一段期间的活动。格仑瑟和蒙哥马利苦心孤诣地搞出来的一些“疯话”是要使西欧人民习惯于这类政策的思想，其结果是，公众对这一骇人听闻的阴谋的反应不及应有那样的尖锐了。
    尽管如此，格仑瑟和蒙哥马利的声明仍然引起了许多国家的不安。在大不列颠，工党议员曾屡次要求邱吉尔和艾登解释这些声明有多少是代表了官方的立场，但是得到的总是一些支吾搪塞的回答。
    不言而喻，他们正在竭力设法掩饰这些决定的真正后果。他们尽其所能来使这些决定少受社会舆论的谴责。有些人硬说，尽管北大西洋公约组织的战争计划应以使用核子武器为基础，可是决定使用这种武器的实权却掌握在文职人员的手里。
    但是要揭发这一类毫无根据的说法并不困难。北大西洋公约组织的武装部队正在准备以使用原子武器和热核子武器为基础的战争。
    假定说，使用或不使用这种武器的决定权在一定时期内是操在政治当局的手里的。可是十二月的巴黎会议以后，政治当局却都同意了使用这种武器。在目前形成的局势下，政治当局将无力在战争中改变这些决定。
    对于那种只有当受到侵略时才来执行这些计划的说法，是不会使欧洲人民放心的。要知道朝鲜战争也是在“防御侵略”的旗帜下进行的。联合国大会大多数代表曾把李承晚的扯谎当作南朝鲜好像是侵略的受害者的证明。在西方阵营内就有只能看到战争前途的人。这些人的活动所引起的战争危机是非常现实的，不久以前北大西洋联盟理事会会议的决议使我们相信，这类战争可能是全面的战争，可能是使用大规模毁灭性武器的战争。
    有些人，——连杜勒斯本人在内，企图安慰欧洲人民，使他们相信，北大西洋公约组织的新计划所规定的只是核子武器在战术方面的使用，而不是在战略方面的使用。但是，这样的差别只是形式上的，一涉及到拥有巨大破坏力的武器，就失去任何意义了。
    在战争发生时，像西方国家所规定的那样“在战术方面”使用核子武器，就会是欧洲人大批的死亡。供投掷原子弹用的飞机为了完成“战术方面的”飞行任务，就要从西欧，特别是从大不列颠的飞机场起飞。只要北大西洋公约组织一开始使用这种武器，所有西欧的居民就会遭到巨大的危害。因此，没有任何实际可能来限制这种武器只能是用于对付战场上的军队的战术活动。
    十二月的北大西洋联盟理事会会议的决议，使裁减军备和禁止核子武器这一问题达成协议更加困难起来。因为，作战计划、军队的编制，甚至军队的部署都是依靠着使用核子武器来决定的，北大西洋公约组织的军事战略家们在反对禁止使用这种武器方面会更加激烈，这也是很明显的。
    这些决定是正在这样的时刻通过的：联合国大会已经一致赞同号召大国在已达成的协议的基础上来继续讨论关于裁减军备和监督原子武器问题，因而使这一问题在目前比在战后任何时候有更大的达成协议的可能性了。
    然而决不能忘记，为武装西德和使西德加入北大西洋公约组织而采取的措施，就是为了使旧日的纳粹军官来使用核子武器，他们之中大多数人都是希望发动复仇战争的。
    西欧各国的人民是能够撕碎北大西洋公约组织参加国的侵略计划并达成缔结关于裁减军备和禁止核子武器的协议的。当前和平运动的最重要的任务，就是使各国人民都认识到巴黎决议所产生的全部危险，并且组织坚决的斗争来反对这些决定的实施。（刘竞译自一九五五年一月十一日“真理报”）
