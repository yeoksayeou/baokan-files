    Gansu plans to expand its irrigated farmland area by more than 600,000 mu this year, an increase of nearly half compared to last year. The planned expansion of paddy fields is mostly in the arid central region and minority areas such as the Linxia Special District, Hedong Hui Autonomous Region, Xihai Gu Hui Autonomous Region, Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Region, and Mongolian Autonomous Region, with the remainder in areas such as the Yinchuan Special District. The arid central region will also increase flood irrigation (gravity-fed irrigation) by 600,000 mu this year.
    This year, the state will provide substantial support to farmers, with planned investments of over 70 billion yuan in water conservancy projects and loans. This will fund the construction of 38 medium-sized water conservancy projects, the establishment of six pumping stations, and the installation of 60 pumps. In addition, farmers in various regions will vigorously develop small-scale water conservancy. There will be widespread construction of water cellars and ponds, and dams will be built in gullies to retain water. In the northern Yellow River Plain, in addition to improving irrigation management, efforts will be made to drain lake water and improve alkaline soil.

    甘肃扩大农田灌溉面积
    甘肃省今年计划扩大灌溉面积六十多万亩，比去年增加将近一半。计划扩大的水田大部分在中部干旱地区和临夏专区、河东回族自治区、西海固回族自治区、甘南藏族自治区、蒙古族自治区等少数民族地区，其余在银川专区等地。中部干旱地区今年还要增加洪水漫地（自流灌溉）六十万亩。
    今年国家将给农民以很大支援，计划投资的水利工程费和贷款有七百多亿元，要修筑三十八处中型水利工程，建立六个抽水机站，安装六十部抽水机。此外，各地农民将大力开展小型水利。将要广泛地修筑水窖、涝池，在沟壑筑坝拦水。北部黄河平原除改进灌溉管理外，将要大力排泄湖水，并改良碱化土壤。　（新华社）
