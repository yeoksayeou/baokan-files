Where Does the Public Property of Agricultural Production Cooperatives Come From?
    Yan Ling

    Public property is an important socialist element within agricultural production cooperatives. Agricultural production cooperatives are able to increase production mainly because they implement unified management and collective labor, and have more and more public property, thus having good conditions for expanding reproduction. Public property belongs to all members of the cooperative, and it closely combines the interests of each member with the interests of the entire cooperative; it is an important economic foundation for consolidating agricultural production cooperatives. With public property, the relationships between people change; as public property increases, members will love their cooperative more and more, and the relationships between members will become more and more intimate. Public property is the most reliable and stable property of the peasants; it does not exploit anyone, but enables all members to become prosperous together.

    Where does the public property of agricultural production cooperatives come from? The main sources are: 1. Shares paid by members (including shares paid by converting privately owned means of production to public ownership at a discounted price, and production funds paid when establishing the cooperative or when new members join the cooperative – that is, the "initial investment"); 2. Public accumulation funds and public welfare funds retained each year from the total agricultural and sideline income, as well as fixed means of production and public welfare tools purchased with public accumulation funds and public welfare funds; 3. Production funds and management fees retained each year from the total agricultural and sideline income of the entire cooperative; 4. Public property transferred from mutual aid teams when they joined the cooperative; 5. Fixed means of production created by the collective labor of the members; 6. Means of production awarded by the government or donated by others (such as international friends).

    How can privately owned means of production (mainly draught animals, large farm tools, including carts and boats) be transferred to public ownership? The following methods can be adopted: The draught animals, carts, and boats can be priced and the amount can be apportioned by the members according to the land, in whole or in part, with the amount limited to what most members can afford; if the land remuneration is very low, the amount can also be apportioned according to a certain proportion of land and labor. If some members are required to pay more and receive less, the shortfall can be paid off in installments within five years. The repayment period for poor members who do not have draught animals, carts, or boats can be extended, and the amount can be reduced for extremely poor members. If some members are entitled to receive more than they are required to pay, the excess will be regarded as their investment, and the cooperative will repay it in installments within five years using the public accumulation fund, with interest not exceeding the interest rate of the state bank's loans to the cooperative. The amounts apportioned by the members will all be regarded as the members' shares. Although these shares are public property, they are recorded under the names of the members who paid them, and the members can take them away when they withdraw from the cooperative. Members should not sell means of production without good reason before and after joining the cooperative; if they really need to sell them due to urgent needs to pay off debts, it should be subject to democratic discussion by the members; in this case, the state bank should provide assistance through credit cooperatives with loans as much as possible to prevent the sale. New members joining the cooperative will apportion shares in the same way as old members; poor new members will also be given the same consideration. When members do not agree to pay shares in this way and the economic strength of the cooperative is insufficient, the privately owned draught animals, carts, and boats of each household can also be temporarily not transferred to public ownership; however, they should be used uniformly by the cooperative according to production needs (with the cooperative giving appropriate remuneration), and members must obtain the approval of the management committee to sell or rent them out or lend them to places outside the cooperative during the production period, or take them outside the cooperative for use. Small farm tools such as hoes and sickles do not need to be transferred to public ownership, nor do they need to be used uniformly by the cooperative; they can be brought by the members themselves without remuneration; in order to facilitate the purchase of new-style farm tools with public accumulation funds, ordinary old-style farm tools such as old-style plows and harrows do not need to be transferred to public ownership, but can be privately owned and publicly used, with the cooperative giving appropriate remuneration.

    Production funds (including seeds, feed and fodder, expenses for purchasing fertilizer, pesticides, repairing farm tools, treating livestock, paying wages to agricultural technicians hired from outside the cooperative, and circulating funds for sideline production, etc.) should be prepaid by the members in part when the cooperative is established in the first year. Production funds can be apportioned according to the land; if the land remuneration is very low, the amount can also be apportioned according to a certain proportion of land and labor; the amount should be limited to what most members can afford, and poor members should be given consideration. These production funds paid by the members are also regarded as shares and recorded under the names of the payers; if any member wants to withdraw from the cooperative, he can take his share away. In addition, some production funds should be retained from the annual agricultural and sideline income. After these production funds are consumed each year, they must be replenished from the agricultural and sideline income. In the event of a famine year, they cannot be replenished, and they should be replenished uniformly by the cooperative when production recovers. Seeds should be selected and retained uniformly by the cooperative every year. These production funds accumulated uniformly by the cooperative cannot be taken away by members when they withdraw from the cooperative. After the old cooperative expands, the required production funds will increase, and the production funds will not be sufficient for the coming year. Therefore, new members should also pay a certain "initial investment" according to the method used by old members when they joined the cooperative.

    Management fees (including expenses for lamp oil, paper, stationery, account books, etc. for office use, wages for accounting personnel hired from outside the cooperative, and expenses for rewarding members, etc.) are very small (generally not exceeding one percent of the total agricultural and sideline income of the year). In the first year of the establishment of the cooperative, they can be temporarily paid by the members, and the cooperative will repay them at the end of the year. In the future, they should be retained in advance from the annual total income.

    Public property transferred from mutual aid teams when they collectively join the cooperative can be priced and used by the members of the mutual aid team to offset the payment of shares, and recorded under his name (if some members do not join the cooperative, the cooperative will be responsible for giving appropriate compensation). No price should be given for public property awarded by the government to mutual aid teams when it is transferred to the public ownership of the cooperative, and individual original members cannot take it away when they withdraw from the cooperative.

    Fixed means of production created by the collective labor of the members refer to unowned wasteland reclaimed collectively by the members, water conservancy projects built collectively, forests cultivated collectively, public houses built collectively, etc. The materials and seedlings required for these fixed means of production can be purchased by the cooperative with public accumulation funds; the labor required can be recorded separately, and each member can share the obligation labor equally, and new members can also appropriately supplement some obligation labor after joining the cooperative (not too much), or record the labor days separately, and give appropriate remuneration from the total income to those who participated in various labor according to the actual effect of increasing production from various constructions within a certain number of years. Each cooperative can also democratically discuss other appropriate methods. These public properties created by the collective labor of the members, as well as public properties awarded by the government or donated by others, are all considered part of the cooperative's public accumulation fund.

    The public accumulation fund occupies a particularly important position in the public property of agricultural production cooperatives. Publicly owned fixed means of production (including livestock, farm tools, sideline tools, water conservancy construction, forestry construction, etc.) are extremely important material forces for agricultural production cooperatives to increase production; and a large part of the publicly owned fixed means of production comes from the public accumulation fund. The public accumulation fund is the source of agricultural production cooperatives' expansion of public property. To maintain fixed means of production regularly, to replenish them in time when they are broken and damaged, and to add more and better fixed means of production, all depend on the public accumulation fund. Therefore, members should be educated to make such provisions when formulating the cooperative's articles of association: the public accumulation fund must not be taken away when any member withdraws from the cooperative, and must not be allowed to be used for other purposes.

    The public welfare fund is used to run public welfare undertakings such as cultural, educational, and health programs within the cooperative, to take care of members' illnesses and childbirths, and to subsidize poor members who are old, weak, orphaned, widowed, disabled, or infirm. This is beneficial to strengthening unity within the cooperative, improving members' culture, and increasing members' welfare. When the public welfare fund increases, it can be used to take care of old, weak, orphaned, widowed, disabled, or infirm members, and the proportion of income from labor and land allocation can also be appropriately changed, and the proportion of dividends from labor can be gradually increased to encourage labor enthusiasm; members who are taken care of can also work harder and produce more with peace of mind; therefore, it is also beneficial to the production of the entire cooperative. It is best for each cooperative to stipulate when formulating the cooperative's articles of association: the public welfare fund cannot be taken away when members withdraw from the cooperative; the cooperative must not use the public welfare fund for other purposes either.

    农业生产合作社的公共财产从哪里来
    燕凌
    公共财产是农业生产合作社里的重要的社会主义因素。农业生产合作社能够提高生产，主要的原因是实行了统一经营和集体劳动，有了越来越多的公共财产，因而有了进行扩大再生产的好条件。公共财产是属于全体社员的，它把每个社员和全社的利益紧紧地结合了起来；它是巩固农业生产合作社的重要的经济基础。有了公共财产，人和人之间的关系就改变了；公共财产越来越多，社员们就会越来越热爱自己的社，社员之间的关系也会越来越亲密。公共财产是农民的最可靠最稳定的财产；它不要去剥削任何人，却能使全体社员共同富裕起来。
    农业生产合作社的公共财产是从哪里来的呢？主要的来源是：一、社员缴纳的股份金（包括把私有的生产资料转归公有时折价抵缴的股份金和建社时、新社员入社时缴纳的生产资金——也就是“底垫”）；二、每年由农业副业总收入中留出的公积金、公益金以及用公积金、公益金购买的固定生产资料、公益用具等；三、每年从全社农副业总收入中留出来的生产资金和管理费；四、互助组转社时转来的公共财产；五、社员集体劳动所创造的固定生产资料；六、政府奖励或者他人（如国际友人等）赠送的生产资料。
    私有的生产资料（主要是耕畜、大农具，包括车、船）怎样转归公有呢？可以采取这样的办法：把耕畜、车、船折价，由社员按土地分摊价款的一部、大部或全部，数量以多数社员能出得起为限；如果土地报酬很低，也可以按土地、劳力各占一定比例的办法分摊。有的社员应出的多，应得的少，不足的部分可以在五年以内分期缴清。没有耕畜、车、船的贫苦社员缴清的年限可以延长，极贫苦的社员可以少缴。有的社员应得的多于应出的，超过部分算作他的投资，由社在五年以内用公积金分期归还，利息不超过国家银行对社放款的利息。社员分摊的价款，都作为社员的股份金。这股份金虽是公共财产，但是分记在缴纳这种股份金的社员名下，社员退社时是可以带走的。社员入社前后，不应无故出卖生产资料；确实因为急需偿付债务等而出卖，应经社员群众民主评议；在这种情况下，要尽可能由国家银行通过信用合作社用贷款帮助，不使出卖。新社员入社，照老社员一样分摊股份金；对贫苦的新社员，也同样给以照顾。在社员不同意这样缴纳股份金、社的经济力量也不足的时候，各户私有的耕畜、车、船也可以暂不转归公有；但是应当由社根据生产需要统一使用（由社给以适当的报酬），社员要出卖或者是在生产期间向社外出租出借、带到社外使用，都要经过管理委员会的同意。私有的锄头、镰刀等小农具，不必转归公有，也不必由社统一使用，可以由社员自带，不给报酬；为了便于使用公积金购买新式农具，对一般的旧式农具，如旧式犁耙等，也可以不必归公，可以私有公用，由社给以适当报酬。
    生产资金（包括种籽、饲料和饲草，购买肥料、农药、修理农具、医治牲口的费用，支付由社外聘请的农业技术人员的工资，副业生产的周转费等），在第一年建社时，是应当由社员预先缴纳一部分的。生产资金可以按土地分摊；如果土地报酬很低，也可以按土地、劳动力各占一定的比例来分摊；数量以多数社员能出得起为限，对贫苦的社员应加以照顾。这种由社员缴纳的生产资金，也作为股份金，分记在缴纳者个人名下，如果哪个社员要退社可以把他的那一份带走。此外，还要从每年的农业和副业收入中留一些生产资金。这些生产资金每年消耗了以后，都必须从农业和副业收入中再补充起来。遇到荒年不能补足，也应该在生产恢复的时候由社统一补足。种籽是每年都应当由社统一选留的。这种由社统一积累的生产资金，社员退社时不能带走。老社扩大后，需要的生产资金要增加，生产资金不够来年用，因此，新社员也应按照老社员入社时的办法缴纳一定的“底垫”。
    管理费（包括办公用的灯油、纸张、文具、账簿等的开支，由社外聘请的会计人员的工资和对社员奖励的费用等），数目很少（一般不超过当年农业副业总收入的百分之一），在建社的第一年，可以由社员暂垫，年终由社归还。往后，应当由每年的总收入中预先留下来。
    互助组集体入社时转来的公共财产，可折价由入社的互助组员抵交股份金，记在他名下（如果有的组员没入社，可由社负责给以适当的补偿）。对于政府奖励给互助组的公共财产，在转归社里公有时，不应给任何代价，个别原组员要退社时也不能带走。
    社员集体劳动所创造的固定生产资料，是指社员集体开垦的无主荒地、集体兴修的水利工程、集体栽培的林木、集体修建的公用房屋等。这些固定生产资料，所需材料、树苗等可由社用公积金购买；所需劳动可分别记载下来，每个社员平均分担义务劳动，新社员入社后也酌情适当地补一些义务劳动
  （不可过多），或者分别记下劳动日，按各项建设对增产发生的实效，在一定年限之内从总收入中给参加各项劳动的人以适当的报酬。各社也可以民主商议别的妥当的办法。这种由社员集体劳动所创造的公共财产，以及政府奖励或他人赠送的公共财产，都算是社的公积金的一部分。
    公积金在农业生产合作社的公共财产中占着特别重要的地位。公有的固定生产资料（包括牲畜、农具、副业工具、水利建设、林业建设等）是农业生产合作社能够增加生产量的极重要的物质力量；而公有的固定生产资料的很大一部分是从公积金来的。公积金是农业生产合作社扩大公共财产的源泉。要经常保持固定生产资料，在破旧损坏时及时补足，要增添更多更好的固定生产资料，都得靠公积金。因此，应当教育社员在制订社章时最好作这样的规定：公积金在任何社员退社时也不得带走，并且不能允许移作别的用途。
    公益金是用来举办社内文化教育卫生等公共福利事业，照顾社员疾病、生育，补助老弱孤寡残废的贫苦社员的。这对于加强社内的团结、提高社员的文化、增进社员的福利都有好处。公益金增加了，能够用以照顾老弱孤寡残废社员了，劳动力和土地分配收益的比例也就可以适当地改变，可以逐步提高劳动力的分红比例，鼓励劳动的积极性；受到照顾的社员也可以更安心地尽力生产；因此，对于全社的生产也是有利的。各社制订社章时最好规定：公益金在社员退社时也不能带；社里也不得把公益金移作别的用途。
