    Supporting the Soviet Union's Just Claims
    Tan Wenrui
    The American aggressive bloc, hostile to the Chinese people, has been illegally obstructing the restoration of the legitimate status and rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, and stubbornly stuffing the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's "representatives" into various organizations and meetings of the United Nations, which has seriously damaged the credibility of the United Nations. Facts have long proven that without the participation of the People's Republic of China, it is impossible to resolve major international issues, especially issues in Asia and the Far East.
    The meeting of the Trade Sub-Committee of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East began in Hong Kong on January 6. The Soviet delegation at the meeting suggested inviting representatives of the government of the People's Republic of China to participate in the meeting and obtain their due legitimate status, pointing out that the "representatives" of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique have no right to represent the Chinese people. This suggestion has been proven thousands of times to be completely justified and reasonable. Representatives of India, Indonesia, and other countries also supported this suggestion.
    However, representatives of some countries used the excuse of "not complying with the meeting procedures" to prevent the meeting from considering and accepting the Soviet proposal. Do these representatives believe that illegally allowing the "representatives" of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to remain, preventing the meeting from proceeding normally and effectively, and from achieving positive results, is in accordance with "meeting procedures"? Obviously, this is a very clumsy excuse. People can only interpret it as them merely catering to the intentions of the United States.
    Since April 28, 1950, our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai has repeatedly telegraphed the Secretary-General of the United Nations, requesting that the "representatives" of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique be expelled from the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, and that the government of the People's Republic of China send representatives to participate in the work of the commission and its subordinate bodies. However, under the manipulation of the United States, the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East has consistently allowed the "representatives" of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to usurp the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China. As a result, this organization has failed to smoothly promote the economic recovery of Asia and the Far East in accordance with its purpose. Now, the trade sub-committee meeting of this organization excludes representatives of the People's Republic of China from participating, inevitably placing itself in a difficult situation. Mr. Kochar, head of the Indian delegation, correctly pointed out: "The Indian delegation strongly feels that without the participation of representatives from the People's Republic of China, the meeting will be difficult to achieve ideal results."
    The People's Republic of China has traditional economic ties and trade relations with Asian and Far Eastern countries, and in recent years our economic development has been booming, making us a major factor in the economic life of Asia and the Far East. Because the People's Republic of China pursues a policy of developing trade with all countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, our economic ties with countries in Asia and the Far East are expanding. Many Asian countries have now established or plan to establish trade relations with the People's Republic of China. This shows that the role of the People's Republic of China in the economic development of Asia and the Far East is absolutely undeniable.
    However, it is precisely the American aggressive bloc that excludes the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations that is pursuing a policy of undermining economic ties and development in Asia and the Far East. The "embargo" policy imposed by the United States on various countries seriously hinders the development of international economic relations and harms the interests of countries in Asia and the Far East in trading with our country. Not only that, the American aggressive bloc also supports and instigates the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique entrenched in Taiwan to increasingly engage in rampant piracy, harass shipping on the high seas, and intercept merchant ships of various countries. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique cannot represent the Chinese people at all, and it has become a public enemy that undermines the principle of freedom of navigation on the high seas and hinders normal international trade. The Trade Sub-Committee of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East allows the "representatives" of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to illegally participate in the meeting, while excluding representatives of the People's Republic of China from the meeting, which is simply a mockery of itself.
    The Chinese people oppose the absurd decision of the Trade Sub-Committee of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East to reject the proposal of the Soviet delegation and continue to exclude the People's Republic of China. The Chinese people believe that this does not conform to the principles of the United Nations Charter and the purpose of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East.

    支持苏联的正义主张
    谭文瑞
    美国侵略集团敌视中国人民，一直非法地阻挠中华人民共和国恢复在联合国中的合法地位和权利，硬把蒋介石卖国集团的“代表”塞在联合国组织的各种机构和会议中，已使联合国的威信受到严重的损害。事实早已证明，没有中华人民共和国的参加，要解决重大的国际问题，特别是解决亚洲和远东的问题，是不可能的。
    联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会贸易小组委员会会议一月六日起在香港举行。苏联代表团在会上建议邀请中华人民共和国政府的代表参加会议并取得应有的合法地位，指出蒋介石卖国集团的“代表”无权代表中国人民。这已经千百遍地证明是完全正当和合理的建议。印度、印度尼西亚等国的代表也支持这个建议。
    但是，某些国家的代表竟以“不合会议程序”为借口，阻止会议考虑和接纳苏联的建议。难道这些代表认为非法地容留蒋介石卖国集团的“代表”，使会议不能够正常地和有效地进行工作和取得积极性的结果，却是符合“会议的程序”吗？显然，这是十分拙劣的借口。人们只能解释为他们不过是在迎合美国的意图罢了。
    我国周恩来外长自一九五○年四月二十八日以来，就曾一再致电联合国秘书长，要求把蒋介石卖国集团的“代表”从亚洲及远东经济委员会驱逐出去，而由中华人民共和国政府派遣代表参加该委员会及其所属各机构的工作。但是，亚洲及远东经济委员会在美国操纵下竟一直让蒋介石卖国集团的
  “代表”窃据着中华人民共和国的合法地位。结果这个组织未能顺利地按照它的宗旨，促进亚洲及远东经济的复兴。现在，这个组织的贸易小组委员会会议排斥中华人民共和国的代表参加，也不可避免地使它自己面临着困难的处境。印度代表团团长科查尔正确地指出：“印度代表团强烈地感觉到，没有中华人民共和国的代表参加，会议将难以获得理想的结果。”
    中华人民共和国同亚洲及远东各国有着传统的经济联系和贸易来往，而且几年以来我国经济发展蒸蒸日上，已成为亚洲及远东经济生活中的一个重大因素。由于中华人民共和国奉行在平等互利基础上与各国发展贸易的政策，我们和亚洲及远东地区国家的经济联系日益扩展，现在许多亚洲国家都和中华人民共和国建立或打算建立贸易关系。这说明，中华人民共和国在发展亚洲及远东地区经济中的作用，是绝对不容忽视的。
    但是，正是排斥中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位的美国侵略集团，推行着破坏亚洲和远东经济联系和发展的政策。美国强加在各国身上的“禁运”政策，就严重地阻碍了国际经济关系的发展，妨害了亚洲和远东地区国家同我国进行贸易的利益。不仅这样，美国侵略集团还支持和唆使盘踞在台湾的蒋介石卖国集团，日益猖獗地进行海盗活动，骚扰公海的航运，拦劫各国的商船。蒋介石卖国集团根本不能代表中国人民，而且它已成为破坏公海航行自由原则，阻碍正常国际贸易的公敌。联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会贸易小组委员会让蒋介石卖国集团的“代表”非法参加会议，反而把中华人民共和国的代表排斥在会议之外，这简直是对自己的一种嘲弄。
    中国人民反对联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会贸易小组委员会会议拒绝苏联代表团的建议，继续排斥中华人民共和国在外的荒谬决定。中国人民认为这是不符合联合国宪章的原则和亚洲及远东经济委员会的宗旨的。
