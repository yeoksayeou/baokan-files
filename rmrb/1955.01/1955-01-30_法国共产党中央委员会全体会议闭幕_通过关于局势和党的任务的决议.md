Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 28th: The plenary session of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party concluded on January 27th, according to TASS.

    At the meeting on the morning of the 27th, Politburo member Waldeck Rochet gave a report on the second item on the agenda—the cantonal elections. Rochet pointed out that the current goal of the Party in the election campaign is to bring the broad masses of the French people into united action to strive for a policy of peace and national independence. The election campaign must begin now. This movement must be closely integrated with the Party's overall activities, that is, with the great struggle that the Communist Party is leading the masses of the people in, against the resurgence of German militarism, against the atomic war being prepared by the imperialists, to defend peace and independence, to fight for bread for the workers, and to defend democratic freedoms. Our Party has every condition to achieve a decisive victory.

    At the closing meeting, FCP General Secretary Maurice Thorez spoke. The plenary session adopted a number of resolutions, including a resolution on the political situation and the tasks of the Communist Party, and a resolution on the cantonal elections.

    The resolution on the political situation analyzed the current situation in France and defined the Party's tasks in the struggle for national independence, for peace, and for improving the lives of the working people.

    The resolution pointed out: In the struggle against the Paris Agreements, the French people, led by the working class, bear a major responsibility. The French people's increasingly resolute opposition to the Paris Agreements, which are completely incompatible with the interests of France and the world, has led to a widespread movement to prevent the ratification of these agreements. Now, all the strength of the French people in this regard should be directed towards the Senate of the Republic, which will soon consider the Paris Agreements.

    The plenary session pointed out that the struggle against the danger of war, the struggle for the national interests of France, and the struggle to satisfy the economic demands of the working people are extremely closely linked.

    The resolution emphasized the need to strengthen the unity of action of the working class and the solidarity of patriotic forces, and emphasized the role played by the Communist Party organizations in the struggle to achieve these goals.

    The resolution said that only with the participation of the Communist Party can the policy changes desired by the whole country be achieved and will be achieved. The Communist Party is striving, and will strive even more resolutely, to establish unity of action of the working class, because the united front is a condition for uniting all national and democratic forces, and this is the key issue at this stage.

    The resolution on the cantonal elections (to be held in April this year) emphasized that the election campaign must begin now. In the election campaign, the French Communist Party will put forward three principles: the current policy must be changed; opposition to the increasingly serious capitalist exploitation caused by the ruling group's pursuit of a policy of preparing for war; and striving to expand democratic freedoms, satisfy the demands of the working class and the entire masses of working people, and defend peace and national independence.

    The resolution pointed out that the French Communist Party will nominate candidates in every canton. Based on the results of the primary elections and the positions of other candidates, it will be decided in the second round of voting whether to retain the Communist Party's candidates or support the candidates of any other party who openly and resolutely advocate peace, oppose the arming of West Germany, and have the potential to defeat the reactionary groups.

    The plenary session pointed out the opportunist activities and violations of Party discipline of former Party Central Committee Secretary Auguste Lecœur. The resolution of the plenary session said that Lecœur is still engaged in opportunist and factional activities and has not made efforts to correct his serious mistakes. Therefore, in accordance with the Party Constitution, the plenary session decided to suspend Lecœur's Party membership for one year.

    法国共产党中央委员会全体会议闭幕
    通过关于局势和党的任务的决议
    【新华社二十九日讯】　据塔斯社巴黎二十八日讯：法国共产党中央委员会全体会议二十七日闭幕。
    在二十七日上午的会议上，政治局委员瓦德克·罗歇作了关于议程上第二个问题——州选举——的报告。罗歇指出：党在选举运动中的当前目标是使广大的法国人民群众采取一致行动来争取实行和平和民族独立的政策。选举运动必须在现在就开始。这个运动必须同党的总的活动密切结合起来，即同共产党正在领导人民群众进行的反对德国军国主义的复活，反对帝国主义者正在准备的原子战争，保卫和平、独立，争取工人的面包，保卫民主自由的伟大斗争密切结合起来。我们党有充分的条件来取得一个决定性的胜利。
    在闭幕会议上法共总书记多列士讲了话。全体会议通过了一些决议，其中有关于政治局势和共产党的任务的决议、关于州选举的决议。
    关于政治局势的决议分析了当前法国的局势，确定了党为争取民族独立、为和平、为改善劳动人民的生活而斗争的任务。
    决议指出：在反对巴黎协定的斗争中，以工人阶级为首的法国人民担负着重大的责任。法国人民愈来愈坚决地反对同法国和世界的利益毫不相容的巴黎协定，因而使得阻止批准这一协定的运动有了广泛的开展。现在，法国人民在这方面的全部力量应当指向即将审议巴黎协定的共和国参议院。
    全体会议指出，反对战争危险、争取法国民族利益的斗争和争取满足劳动人民的经济要求的斗争，是极其紧密地联系在一起的。
    决议着重指出，必须加强工人阶级的行动一致和团结爱国力量，并且着重谈到共产党组织在实现这些目的的斗争中所起的作用。
    决议说，只有在共产党的参加下，举国所希望的政策改变才能够达到而且一定会达到。共产党正在、而且将更加坚决地争取建立工人阶级的行动一致，因为统一战线是团结一切民族的和民主的力量的条件，这是现阶段的关键问题。
    关于州选举（将在今年四月举行）问题的决议中着重指出，必须现在就开始展开选举运动。法国共产党在选举运动中将提出三个原则：必须改变目前的政策；反对由于统治集团奉行准备战争的政策而日益加重的资本主义剥削；争取扩大民主自由，满足工人阶级和全体劳动人民群众的要求，保卫和平和民族独立。
    决议指出，法国共产党将在每一个州提出候选人。根据初选的结果和其他候选人的立场，将决定在第二次投票时或是保留共产党的候选人，或是支持其他任何党派的公开和坚决主张和平、反对武装西德、并有可能战胜反动集团的候选人的候选人。
    全体会议指出了前党中央委员会书记奥古斯特·勒戈尔的机会主义活动和违反党的纪律的行动。全体会议的决议说，勒戈尔还在继续进行机会主义和派别活动，并且没有努力改正自己的严重错误。因此，全体会议根据党章，决定停止勒戈尔的党籍一年。
