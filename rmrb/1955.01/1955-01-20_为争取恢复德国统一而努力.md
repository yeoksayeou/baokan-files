    The American aggressor bloc and its Western European followers, after forcing the French National Assembly to pass the Paris Accords through brutal pressure and deceptive means, are now trying to use the same methods to deal with the West German Federal Assembly, in order to make West Germany accept this agreement. This places the German people and the West German parliament with an important choice concerning the future of Germany.
    The Soviet government's statement on the German question issued on January 15 correctly analyzes this situation and points out the path to resolving the German problem, restoring German unity, and re-emerging as a major power. The Soviet government's statement is of great significance for seeking the peaceful reunification of Germany and for guaranteeing European collective security. It has been warmly welcomed by the peace-loving people of Germany and Europe.
    As the Soviet government's statement points out: the Paris Accords run counter to the interests of the German people because they will keep Germany divided for a long time and become an obstacle to the peaceful restoration of German unity. It is known that the Paris Accords openly revive German militarism and intend to drag West Germany into a military aggressive bloc against the Soviet Union and peace-loving countries in Eastern Europe. At the same time, it stipulates that the United States, Britain, and France will continue to maintain their occupation of West Germany until the end of this century, and it deprives the German people of their right to achieve the unification of their country themselves. In this case, the situation of Germany being divided into two parts will be fixed, and the merger of West Germany and the peace-loving German Democratic Republic into a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany will become impossible. The division of Germany and West Germany's joining the military aggressive bloc will lead to a fratricidal civil war among Germans and a new world war; causing the German people and the world to suffer another huge disaster.
    The German people see all of this very clearly. The German people have expressed their determination to oppose the Paris Accords and demand negotiations to restore German unity. Many West German trade union organizations have passed resolutions opposing re-militarization and demanding the rejection of the Paris Accords. Recently, as the date for the final review of the Paris Accords by the West German Federal Assembly approaches, the rallies and demonstrations protesting the Paris Accords held in West Germany are increasing. People from all walks of life in West Germany are enthusiastically participating in the German Communist Party's "struggle week" against the Paris Accords; the Social Democratic Party has also decided to launch a broad movement throughout West Germany in the second half of January to oppose the ratification of the Paris Accords by the West German Federal Assembly.
    In order to deceive public opinion and ease the opposition of the German people, the peddlers of the Paris Accords are trying their best to lie, saying that the ratification of the Paris Accords will not only not hinder negotiations on the German issue and other outstanding international issues, but will also help such negotiations. The conspiracy contained in this argument is very obvious, and its purpose is only to enable the Paris Accords to be ratified quickly. The Soviet government's statement on the German issue once again pointed out the groundlessness of this statement, which completely exposes the conspiracy of Western countries to create illusions about four-power consultations among the people to cover up the passage of the Paris Accords.
    Facts have proved that the American aggressor bloc and its followers have no intention of making Germany a peaceful, democratic, and unified country. They only want to use West Germany as a tool to prepare for a new war. For this purpose, the Paris Accords even stipulate that the rebuilt West German army can possess chemical weapons, bacteriological weapons, and atomic weapons. They even openly stipulated that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization can use atomic weapons. This criminal act, which violates international agreements and human conscience, shows that the Western aggressor bloc is determined to make West German militarists play an important role in their future large-scale atomic weapons war to massacre humanity. Once Germany is involved in such a devastating war, the disasters it will suffer will obviously not be comparable to any previous war. This is why the German people absolutely cannot accept the terrible fate arranged for them by the Washington warmongering group.
    It is very clear that the current task of the German people and the people of European countries is to oppose the ratification of the Paris Accords and strive for the peaceful reunification of Germany. The Soviet government's statement pointed out: "At present, there are still possibilities that have not been utilized in reaching an agreement on the issue of restoring German unity while properly taking into account the legitimate interests of the German people and holding free all-German elections for this purpose in 1955. Such a possibility exists if the main obstacles to restoring German unity—the plans to remilitarize West Germany and make it join a military bloc—are eliminated." The Soviet government believes that the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union must hold negotiations on the issue of restoring German unity through free all-German elections, and expressed its willingness to normalize relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany. On the issue of holding free general elections throughout Germany, the Soviet government believes that it is necessary to ensure that German citizens can enjoy democratic rights in the elections, and in order to reach an agreement in this regard, it is possible to negotiate the establishment of appropriate international supervision for holding all-German elections. This fair and reasonable proposal of the Soviet government has once again opened the way for resolving the German issue. This fully proves that restoring German unity and making Germany a peace-loving power has always been the goal pursued by the Soviet Union on the German issue. The consistent efforts made by the Soviet Union to seek a solution to the German issue not only conform to the national interests of the German people, but also conform to the interests of safeguarding European security. The spokesperson of the West German Social Democratic Party believes that the Soviet government's statement is "indeed a remarkable event" and believes that it is necessary to seriously study this proposal in order to use it to achieve talks that can lead to German reunification. It can be seen that the Soviet government's statement reflects the aspirations of patriotic people from broad sections of German society.
    Now, the two paths before Germany are very clear: one is to move towards war and the division of Germany, which is the path arranged by the Paris Accords; the other is to move towards peaceful reunification and prosperous revival, which is the path that the establishment of a European collective security system can provide. The efforts of all patriotic forces in Germany to oppose the ratification of the Paris Accords and strive for German unity undoubtedly have extremely important significance at present.
    The Chinese people firmly support the Soviet government's statement on the German issue, support the German people's struggle against the ratification of the Paris Accords, and, in the event that the Paris Accords are ratified, firmly support the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries in Europe in taking all measures to safeguard their own security and strengthen European peace.

### 为争取恢复德国统一而努力

    为争取恢复德国统一而努力
    美国侵略集团和它的西欧的追随者在以粗暴的压力和欺骗手段迫使法国国民议会通过巴黎协定之后，现在正力图以同样的手段来对付西德联邦议院，使西德接受这个协定。这就使德国人民和西德议会面临了一个关系着德国的将来的重要选择。
    苏联政府一月十五日发表的关于德国问题的声明，正确地分析了这种情势，并且指出了争取解决德国问题、使德国恢复统一和重新成为一个大国的道路。苏联政府的声明对于谋求德国的和平统一，对于保障欧洲集体安全有着十分重大的意义。它受到德国和欧洲爱好和平人民的热烈欢迎。
    正如苏联政府的声明中所指出的：巴黎协定是和德国人民的利益背道而驰的，因为它将使德国长期处于分裂状态，成为和平恢复德国统一的障碍。人们知道，巴黎协定公然复活德国军国主义，并且要把西德拖入反对苏联和东欧爱好和平国家的军事侵略集团。同时，它规定美、英、法三国将继续维持对西德的占领到本世纪末，它剥夺了德国人民自己实现本国统一的权利。在这种情况下，德国分裂为东西两部分的局面将被固定化，而西德和爱好和平的德意志民主共和国合并成为一个统一的、和平的和民主的德国也将成为不可能。德国的陷于分裂和西德加入军事侵略集团，就会导向德国人自相残杀的内战和新的世界大战；使德国人民和全世界又一次遭受巨大的灾难。
    德国人民对于这一切是看得很清楚的。德国人民已表示了他们反对巴黎协定、要求协商恢复德国统一的决心，许多西德工会组织都通过了反对重新军国主义化和要求否决巴黎协定的决议；最近，随着西德联邦议会对巴黎协定进行最后审议的日期日益临近，在西德举行的抗议巴黎协定的集会和示威是越来越多了。西德各阶层人民正在热烈参加德国共产党的反对巴黎协定的“斗争周”的活动；社会民主党也决定了在一月下半月在西德全境展开广泛的运动来反对西德联邦议会批准巴黎协定。
    巴黎协定的贩卖者为了欺骗舆论、缓和德国人民的反对情绪，竭力撒谎说，批准巴黎协定不仅不会阻碍就德国问题和其他悬而未决的国际问题进行谈判，而且会有助于这种谈判的进行。这种论调所包含的阴谋是十分显然的，它的目的只是想使得巴黎协定能够迅速获得批准。苏联政府关于德国问题的声明再一次指出了这种说法的毫无根据，这就完全揭破了西方国家企图在人民中间制造关于四国协商的幻想来掩护巴黎协定过关的阴谋。
    事实证明，美国侵略集团和它的追随者根本无意使德国成为一个和平、民主、统一的国家，他们只是想利用西德作为准备新战争的工具。为了这样的目的，巴黎协定，竟规定让重建起来的西德军队拥有化学武器、细菌武器和原子武器。它们甚至公然规定北大西洋公约集团可以使用原子武器。这种违反国际协定和人类良心的罪恶行径，表明了西方侵略集团一心要使西德军国主义者在它们未来的大规模屠杀人类的原子武器战争中扮演重要的角色。德国一旦被卷进这样一个毁灭性的战争之中，它所要遭受的灾难显然不是过去任何一次战争所能比拟的。这就是为什么德国人民绝对不能接受华盛顿好战集团给他们安排的可怕命运的道理。
    事情很明显，德国人民和欧洲各国人民当前的任务，就是反对批准巴黎协定，为争取德国的和平统一而努力。苏联政府的声明中指出：“目前，在就恢复德国统一问题达成协议而适当地照顾到德国人民的正当利益和为此在一九五五年举行全德自由选举方面，仍然还有没有加以利用的可能性，这样的可能性是存在的，假使消除妨碍恢复德国统一的主要障碍——使西德重新军国主义化和使它加入军事集团的计划——的话。”苏联政府认为，美、英、法、苏必须就通过全德自由选举来恢复德国统一的问题举行谈判，并且表示愿意使苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间的关系正常化。对在全德举行自由普选的问题，苏联政府认为必须保证在选举中德国公民能够享受民主权利，而且为了在这方面达成协议，就举行全德选举建立适当的国际监督问题进行谈判是可能的。苏联政府的这种公平合理的主张，为解决德国问题再一次开辟了道路。这充分证明了，恢复德国统一，并使德国成为一个爱好和平的大国，始终是苏联在德国问题上所追求的目的。苏联为谋求解决德国问题所作的这种一贯的努力，不但符合于德国人民的民族利益，也符合于保障欧洲安全的利益。西德社会民主党的发言人就认为苏联政府的声明“的确是一件引人注意的大事”，并且认为必须认真研究这个建议，以便利用它来实现能够导向德国重新统一的会谈。由此可见，苏联政府的声明是反映了德国广泛阶层爱国人士的愿望的。
    现在，摆在德国面前的两条道路是很清楚的：一条是走向战争和德国的分裂，这就是巴黎协定所安排下的道路；另外一条就是走向和平统一和繁荣复兴的道路，这就是建立欧洲集体安全体系所能够提供的道路。德国一切爱国力量为反对批准巴黎协定、争取德国统一的努力，在目前无疑有着极其重大的意义。
    中国人民坚决支持苏联政府关于德国问题的声明，支持德国人民反对批准巴黎协定而进行的斗争，并且在巴黎协定一旦批准的情况下，也坚决支持苏联和欧洲其他爱好和平的国家，为保障自身的安全和加强欧洲的和平而采取的一切措施。
