Xinhua News Agency, January 5th: The broad masses of commanders and fighters of the border defense, coastal defense, and naval forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are angrily denouncing the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" between the U.S. and Chiang, and are determined to strengthen all aspects of their work for the liberation of Taiwan.

The East China Naval Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held a rally on December 30th of last year to oppose the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty." Combat heroes and model workers such as Wang Weifu, commander of the "Toumenshan Naval Battle Hero Boat," and Zhu Hongxi, representative of a naval unit that sank the Chiang bandit's "Taiping" escort destroyer, spoke at the meeting, unanimously expressing their determination to contribute everything to smash the U.S.-Chiang war treaty and liberate Taiwan. All the commanders and fighters who participated in the meeting unanimously adopted the "Eight Pledges to Oppose the U.S.-Chiang Treaty and Resolutely Liberate Taiwan." The pledges require all commanders and fighters to actively fight, strengthen vigilance, and work hard to study military affairs, politics, and culture, so as to train every soldier into a combat expert, and use practical actions to smash the war provocations of the American aggressive bloc.

Units of the Yunnan Military Region stationed on the southwest border of the motherland also held symposiums to oppose the U.S.-Chiang treaty. He Zhenghua, a meritorious soldier of the first class from a certain unit, said in an article written for the newspaper published by the military region: The so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" signed by the U.S. and Chiang is an aggressive "treaty" that thoroughly violates our country's territorial sovereignty and interferes in our internal affairs. In order to defend the integrity of our country's territorial sovereignty, I am ready at any time to respond to the call of the motherland and dedicate all my strength to the liberation of Taiwan.

The artillerymen of the first gun of a certain artillery unit on the Fujian front line, who won a glorious victory in the battle against the Chiang bandit army on Kinmen Island on September 3 last year, immediately held a discussion on the position after reading Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. Gunner Zhang Jianchao and Second Class Merit recipient, gunner Wang Yingnan, said: We are the defenders of the motherland, and not an inch of the motherland's land is allowed to be invaded by U.S. imperialism! The artillerymen then automatically checked and revised their plans to strive for the liberation of Taiwan. After seeing Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, the anti-aircraft artillery unit guarding Xiamen Island also universally and automatically held discussions on the position, and convened a general meeting of all soldiers that day. Everyone unanimously expressed that they would support and support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement with practical actions of continuing to improve combat skills and strengthen combat readiness.

Sun Feng'an, a ground crew member of a certain aircraft service group of an air force unit on the Zhejiang front line who won the collective second-class merit, said: Foreign Minister Zhou's statement has brought us even greater strength. If the American aggressors dare to obstruct the just action of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan, they will inevitably suffer a tragic defeat.

    决心为解放台湾献出一切力量
      【新华社五日讯】中国人民解放军边防、海防和海军部队广大指挥员、战斗员愤怒斥责美蒋所谓
  “共同防御条约”，决心为解放台湾加强各方面的工作。
    中国人民解放军华东海军部队在去年十二月三十日举行了反对美蒋“共同防御条约”大会，“头门山海战英雄艇”艇长王维福、击沉蒋贼“太平号”护航驱逐舰的某海军部队代表朱洪禧等战斗英雄和模范工作者，都在会上讲了话，一致表示坚决为粉碎美蒋的战争条约，为解放台湾而贡献出自己的一切。参加大会的全体指战员一致通过了“反对美蒋条约、坚决解放台湾八项公约”。公约中要求全体指战员积极作战、加强戒备，努力学习军事、政治和文化，把每个战士都锻炼成为战斗能手，用实际行动来粉碎美国侵略集团的战争挑衅。
    驻守在祖国西南边疆的云南军区部队，有些单位也举行了反对美蒋条约的座谈会。某部战士甲等功臣何正华在写给军区出版的报纸的文章中说：美蒋签订的所谓“共同防御条约”，彻头彻尾是一个侵犯我国领土主权、干涉我国内政的侵略“条约”。为了保卫我国领土主权的完整，我要随时准备响应祖国的号召，为解放台湾而献出自己的全部力量。
    福建前线曾在去年九月三日痛击金门岛蒋贼军的战斗中获得光辉胜利的某炮兵部队第一炮的炮手们，读了周外长的声明后，当即在阵地上进行了座谈。炮长张建朝、二等功臣炮手王映南说：我们是祖国的保卫者，祖国的每一寸土地都不容许美帝国主义侵略！炮手们随后还自动检查和修订了他们为解放台湾而奋斗的决心计划。守卫在厦门岛上的高射炮部队某连看到周外长的声明后，也普遍地自动地在阵地上进行了座谈，并在当天召开了全连军人大会，大家一致表示要以继续提高作战技术、加强战斗准备的实际行动，拥护和支持周外长的声明。
    浙江前线某空军部队荣立集体二等功的某飞机勤务组的地勤人员孙凤安说：周外长的声明，给我们带来了更大的力量，美国侵略者如果胆敢阻挠中国人民解放台湾的正义行动，它必将遭到悲惨的失败。
