    Facing Difficulties
    Xie Yueming
    When building the tool workshop, the Sun Shuqin group, along with other carpentry groups, accepted the task of laying "wooden brick floors." It seemed like a simple job, but no one knew how to do it. They calculated that a group could lay at most two square meters per day. However, according to the task requirements, they had to lay 2.5 square meters per day. Otherwise, it would delay the project’s progress and prevent the workshop from being put into production on schedule. After the workers had been working for some days, the Ren Fuxian group, which had the highest efficiency, laid three square meters per day, but the quality did not meet the standards. The workers in Sun Shuqin’s group were very anxious, seeing that the progress had already been delayed for ten days. So they studied the problem and actively sought advice from Soviet experts. Based on the experts' instructions, they reorganized the division of labor and implemented a phased construction method, which made their work much more efficient. Then, group leader Sun Shuqin created a sand-laying tool, changing the method of laying it by hand. From then on, the efficiency of their group accelerated. At its highest, they could lay more than ten square meters a day, more than three times the plan, and the quality was also very good. Soviet expert Comrade Danilichev said, "Excellent, just like the way Soviet workers lay them!"

    There are also the deeds of the riveter Sha Chengde group overcoming difficulties. When they were welding the steel purlins for the factory building, because they had never done this kind of work before, they could not weld them well – they would deform as soon as they were welded. Sha Chengde pondered this matter for several days. He thought: the steel purlins deform when heated all at once. If they are welded in sections, the temperature will be lower and they might not deform, right? He wasn't sure, so he discussed his idea with a Soviet expert. The expert listened and said, "Good, let's do it that way!" He went back and made several clamps to clamp the steel purlins to be welded together. First, they were welded every five minutes, and then they were welded completely. Finally, the difficulty was overcome, and the quality of the welded steel purlins met the design requirements.

    In 1953, the project was proceeding intensely. Suddenly, the cold air from Siberia crossed the Greater Khingan Mountains, and the temperature dropped. The workers had to build the forging and pressing workshop and the more than 30-meter-high chimney in the cold weather of minus 10 to 20 degrees Celsius. Every morning, there was a layer of white snow on the ground. The workers in the bricklayer Li Rongchang group had only been working on the scaffolding for a short time when the water on their gloves froze into ice, and their hands felt like they were being pricked with needles. The young worker Li Hongming, whose hands were frozen and not flexible, took off his gloves and rubbed his hands vigorously, then put on his gloves and continued working. Although the weather was very cold and there were many operational difficulties, the workers overfulfilled their plans every day and also ensured quality. Riveting and welding workers braved heavy snow to install 82-ton steel roof trusses on the roof of the 17-meter-high factory building. The wind was stronger and colder at high altitudes, and the workers' eyebrows and beards turned silvery white. Engineering and technical personnel were also with the workers all day long. Probationary technician Gu Fusheng ran up and down all day long, sometimes working with the workers at high altitudes all day long. The workers said, "Old Gu is really something, you can't even tell he's a university graduate."

    在困难面前
    谢月明
    修建工具车间的时候，孙书琴小组和其它木工小组一起，接受了铺“木砖地板”的任务。看起来似乎活很简单，就是谁也不知道怎样干。他们计算了一下，一个小组每天顶多能铺二平方公尺。但是根据任务要求，每天必须铺二点五平方公尺，不然，就会推迟工程进度，使车间不能按期投入生产。工人们干了些日子，效率最高的任傅先小组每天虽然铺了三平方公尺，但质量达不到标准。孙书琴小组的工人们，眼巴巴地看着进度已拖了十天，非常着急，于是大家研究，并主动地去找苏联专家出主意。他们根据专家的指示，重新分工，实行了分段的施工方法，干起活来就利落得多了。接着，小组长孙书琴又创造了一种铺砂工具，改变了用手铺的办法。从此，他们小组的效率就加快了，最高的时候，一天能铺十平方公尺以上，超过计划三倍多，质量也很好。苏联专家达尼里切夫同志说：“太好了，跟苏联工人铺的一样了！”

    还有那铆工沙成德小组克服困难的事迹。他们烧焊厂房的钢檩的时候，因为过去没干过这种活，总烧不好——一烧就变型。沙成德好几天都琢磨这件事。他想：钢檩一次烧热就变型，要是分着烧，热度低些可能不会变型吧？他没把握，就跟苏联专家谈了自己的想法。专家听了，说：“好，就这么办吧！”他回去做了几个卡子，把要烧的钢檩卡在一起，起先，每隔五分钟一烧，然后再全烧，终于困难被克服了，烧好的钢檩质量都达到了设计的要求。

    一九五三年，工程正紧张地进行着。突然西伯利亚的寒流越过了大兴安岭，气温下降了。工人们不得不在零下一、二十度的寒冷天气里，修建锻压车间和三十多公尺高的大烟囱。每天早晨，地上是白白的一层雪。瓦工李荣昌小组的工人，刚上架子干不久，手套上的水就结成了冰，手冻得像针刺似的。青年工人李鸿鸣，手冻得不灵活，就摘下手套，用劲地搓一搓手，然后带上手套再干。虽然天气很冷，操作上的困难多，但工人们每天都超额完成计划，还保证了质量。铆焊工人们冒着大雪在十七公尺高的厂房顶上安装八十二吨重的钢屋架。高空的风更大，更冷，工人们的眉毛、胡子都成了银白色的。工程技术人员也整天和工人们在一起。见习技术员顾福生整天跑上跑下，有时整天跟工人在高空上工作。工人们说：“老顾真行，一点也看不出是个大学毕业生。”
