    Shuangqiao State Farm Cultivates Superior Chicken Breed
    The Shuangqiao State Farm, located in the eastern suburbs of Beijing, has cultivated a superior chicken breed. For years, Shuangqiao Farm has raised large numbers of Leghorn chickens (imported from Italy). This was originally a good breed, but its productivity has been gradually declining in recent years. Each chicken only laid an average of 180 eggs per year, and they were very small. Furthermore, because the chickens were small and had weak resistance, they were susceptible to disease and death. In order to improve this gradual degradation, the farm adopted a method of crossbreeding Leghorn chickens with Australian Black chickens for experimentation. After a year of cultivation, the resulting chicks were larger and healthier than Leghorns. The initial egg weight was over 50 grams (Leghorn eggs are only about 45 grams). On average, each chicken lays more than 195 eggs per year. The chickens are about one jin heavier than Leghorns and have a strong cold resistance, continuing to lay eggs even in the severe winter of minus 15 degrees Celsius. Currently, Shuangqiao Farm is planning to develop this chicken breed on a large scale to meet the people's needs for eggs.

    国营双桥农场培育了优良鸡种
    北京东郊国营双桥农场培育出一种优良鸡种。双桥农场历年都饲养大批莱克亨（意大利出产）种鸡，这原是较好的品种，但其生产率近年来也在逐渐退化，每只鸡每年平均只产蛋一百八十枚，而且很小。又因鸡身较小，抵抗力不强，容易得疾病而死亡。该场为了改善这种逐渐退化的情况，便采取莱克亨鸡与澳洲黑鸡杂交的办法进行试验，经过一年来的培育结果，所产小鸡较莱克亨体大而健康，初产蛋体重都在五十克以上（莱克亨鸡蛋只有四十五克左右），平均每只鸡年产蛋一百九十五个以上。鸡体比莱克亨约重一斤，抗寒能力很强，在零下十五度的寒冬还能继续生蛋。目前，双桥农场正有计划地大量发展这种鸡种，供应人民蛋品需要。
