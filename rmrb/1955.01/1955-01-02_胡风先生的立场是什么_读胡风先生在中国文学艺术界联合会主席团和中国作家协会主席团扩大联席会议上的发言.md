    What is Mr. Hu Feng's Position?
    —Reading Mr. Hu Feng's Speech at the Enlarged Joint Meeting of the Presidium of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association
    Zhou Jichang
    Recently, the Presidium of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association convened an enlarged joint meeting to comprehensively examine "Literary Gazette." Many writers spoke at the meeting about the mistakes made by "Literary Gazette" over the past five years. Mr. Hu Feng also spoke twice at the meeting. However, I believe that Mr. Hu Feng's speech held an incorrect position.
    First of all, it needs to be pointed out that Mr. Hu Feng's view on the new situation of the entire literary and art circles being mobilized to launch a fierce struggle against the bourgeois idealism entrenched in the field of literature and art, caused by Mr. Yu Pingbo's erroneous thoughts on the study of "Dream of the Red Chamber," and the correction of the errors committed by "Literary Gazette" is inconsistent with ours.
    We know that the erroneous thoughts of Mr. Yu Pingbo's research on "Dream of the Red Chamber" have not been exposed for a long time, indicating that the reactionary bourgeois idealism of the Hu Shi faction occupies an important position in our field of classical literature research and has not been destroyed. Therefore, today, the criticism of bourgeois ideology initiated by comrades Li Xifan and Lan Ling, holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, has its particularly significant meaning. As Comrade Guo Moruo, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, pointed out in his "Three Suggestions" speech: "This discussion is of educational significance. It is a serious ideological struggle of Marxism against bourgeois idealism. It is a continued development of ideological remolding and self-education. It is a cultural mobilization to adapt to the general task of the country's transition period." The fact is also true, cultural and educational departments across the country have attached great importance to it and have successively begun discussions. Whether writers, professors, scientific workers, or journalists, they have all solemnly criticized and reprimanded the absurd arguments of bourgeois idealism, and have practically devoted themselves to this movement with profound historical significance. From many places across the country, from inside the Party to outside the Party, from young people to old people, everyone has actively acted to form a strong united front in the fierce struggle against bourgeois idealism, and this front is equipped with Marxist-Leninist weapons, so it will inevitably be invincible. Facts have proved that the valuable first shot fired by comrades Li Xifan and Lan Ling has hit the vital point of Hu Shi's bourgeois idealism. Isn't this precisely a sign of the beginning of the victory of this battle?
    However, let's see what Mr. Hu Feng's attitude towards this movement is? In his second speech, he began by saying:
    "First, let me talk about my mood. After the 'Literary Gazette' issue occurred, my personal mood was heavy. Because, in any case, this is a failure on our front. The failure is a common one for all of us, so the mood is very heavy. Some comrades said that I was very emotional in my last speech. Yes, I was very emotional. This came from a sense of failure. I couldn't control myself." (The emphasis is added by me—Jichang's note.) What can these dejected, frustrated, and pessimistic laments explain? According to Mr. Hu Feng's argument, "the occurrence of the 'Literary Gazette' issue" means "a failure on our front," and it is "in any case." Here, one cannot help but suspect, what kind of "front" is Mr. Hu Feng referring to? Is it the revolutionary literary and artistic front of Marxism-Leninism? Or is it some other front?
    What is our front? Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out clearly as early as May 23, 1942, at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art: "Since our literature and art are for the masses of the people, then we can further discuss a question of internal Party relations, the relationship between the Party's literary and artistic work and the Party's overall work, and another question of external Party relations, the relationship between the Party's literary and artistic work and non-Party literary and artistic work—the question of the united front of literary and art circles." Isn't it obvious? Isn't the front where we are fighting against Hu Shi's bourgeois idealism today precisely the united front of literary and artistic workers inside and outside the Party, closely united, as pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong? Since it is this front, we have the confidence that our struggle will surely be victorious. Facts speak louder than words. The so-called "occurrence of the 'Literary Gazette' issue" only shows the bourgeois aristocratic style of "Literary Gazette" and its surrender to the erroneous thoughts of Hu Shi's bourgeois ideas after being attacked by them. When this erroneous ideological style is criticized by Marxist-Leninist thought, and the editorial department of "Literary Gazette" has conducted an examination and self-criticism, it only shows that under the strong leadership of the Party, "Literary Gazette" has broken away from the quagmire of errors and is moving towards a new life, and it also only shows that the united front of literary and art circles has achieved an unprecedented major victory in the struggle against the bourgeoisie. Therefore, we should congratulate the literary and art circles and congratulate "Literary Gazette." Anyone living in the Mao Zedong era who is somewhat conscious will have such a "mood." It is always happy when others' or one's own mistakes are corrected and are moving towards a new life. Only those who adhere to mistakes, resolutely refuse to accept criticism, are deeply contaminated with bourgeois idealism, and are extremely stubborn will feel heavy and sad, even hateful.
    Today, after accepting the criticism of the Party newspaper, "Literary Gazette" has actively carried out an examination. Comrade Feng Xuefeng, the editor-in-chief of "Literary Gazette," and the editorial department have made public self-criticisms and expressed their determination to improve their work. What reason do we have not to welcome them? What reason do we have to pour cold water on them—the comrades who are conducting self-criticism? We should give care in many ways, help them examine their thoughts more deeply, and actively encourage his fighting enthusiasm, pointing out that his recognition of his mistakes is a victory on our front. This is warm and well-intentioned for comrades who make mistakes. Comrade Mao Zedong once sincerely warned us: "Anyone who makes mistakes, as long as he does not conceal his illness and refuse treatment, does not stubbornly persist in his mistakes to the point of being incurable, but is honest and truly willing to be treated and willing to correct himself, we should welcome him, cure his illness, and make him a good comrade." [1]
    But what about Mr. Hu Feng? On the one hand, he exaggerates the mistake of "Literary Gazette" as "a failure on our front," even "in any case"; on the other hand, he pours cold water on comrades who have publicly reviewed their mistakes. Not only did he not use warm words to care for and encourage them when they recognized their mistakes, but he used cheap sympathy and tears of pity to give hypocritical comfort, dejectedly feeling "sad" for them. May I ask, what is Mr. Hu Feng's intention in saying these words? What is his position?
    In order to better clarify the problem, we can also confirm from other aspects that Mr. Hu Feng's position is unstable and he is not a genuine Marxist.
    When this movement started vigorously, many writers, professors, and relevant people consciously organized themselves to conduct discussions and criticisms. But Mr. Hu Feng initially showed a very passive and lazy attitude. Let's analyze it in his own words! He complained: "Before the last meeting, a leading comrade of the Writers Association advised me to write an article, and Comrade Chen Qixia also asked me to write an article." Then he reluctantly said: "Since the comrades treat this issue so sincerely, I looked through Volumes 1 and 2 of 'Literary Gazette'." (The emphasis is all added by me—Jichang's note.) The meaning of these words is that if the responsible comrades of the Writers Association and Comrade Chen Qixia did not "ask" him, or even "advise" him, he would not think that the comrades were "sincerely treating this issue." Or, he "wouldn't" even "look" at "Literary Gazette."
    As a writer, facing such a vigorous scene of ideological struggle, is it tolerable to take a passive and slack attitude? As a writer, one should regard struggle as the main thing. But what about Mr. Hu Feng? He clearly knows that the significance of this struggle is very profound, but not only does he not take consciously participating in the struggle as his own responsibility, but he deliberately shows a very relaxed and lazy attitude, "Since" "asked me," "advised me," "I then...", the tone is so reluctant, even a bit complaining. Doesn't the emergence of this attitude precisely come from his "sense of failure"? Here, it is not difficult to see that Mr. Hu Feng is by no means a true Marxist. Because a person who truly understands Marxism will show a high degree of fighting political enthusiasm on any occasion. But Mr. Hu Feng, facing such a scene of struggle, not only has no political enthusiasm at all, but even the "subjective fighting spirit" that he has always flaunted is nowhere to be found. And he only feels "the failure on the front," making a serious distortion of the evaluation of this movement, which is intolerable.
    Here, we can also illustrate from another aspect that Mr. Hu Feng's attitude towards this movement is not sincere, and it is not an exaggeration to say that he is deliberately creating troubles. In Mr. Hu Feng's speech, he used a lot of words to criticize "Literary Gazette" for reprinting the articles by comrades Chen Yong and Shi Du criticizing Mr. A Long published in "People's Daily" and "People's Literature and Art" in 1950, and believes that this is a "blow," "suppression," and "hostility" to progressive writers and new forces. I think this is also a serious distortion and defamation of "Literary Gazette," and it reverses black and white, confuses right and wrong, and blurs the eyes of the broad masses, thereby shifting the direction of the struggle. Here, the first thing that needs to be clarified is: Was it a wrong act for "Literary Gazette" to reprint the article from "People's Daily" and add an editor's note? Regarding this question, I think anyone with a little political enthusiasm can see it. Not only did "Literary Gazette" not do anything wrong, on the contrary, "Literary Gazette" precisely correctly demonstrated its support and compliance with the Party's intentions in this matter, helping the Party to further clarify the negative impact caused by Mr. A Long's "distortion of Marxism" among the masses. Is there anything wrong with doing this? "Literary Gazette" reprinted the article from "People's Daily," indicating that "Literary Gazette" believed in the Party newspaper and believed in the Party. There was nothing wrong with doing this. Moreover, the articles by Chen and Shi published in "People's Daily" were basically correct. They clarified the erroneous influence caused by Mr. A Long's distortion of Marxism; they severely criticized Mr. A Long's proposed so-called "art is politics" and the absurd argument that essentially negated the description of "positive characters," thereby further clarifying the direction of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. Isn't this criticism beneficial to the people? Didn't it uphold the people's and the Party's literary and artistic policy? Therefore, it was completely right for "Literary Gazette" to reprint it. But Mr. Hu Feng criticized "Literary Gazette" for "suppressing small people" based on this, isn't this a serious distortion and serious defamation?
    Mr. A Long publicly reviewed the articles by comrades Chen and Shi criticizing him in "People's Daily" on March 26, 1950, and expressed his attitude: "I will conduct a good review and completely accept the criticisms." "The mistake is mine. Please criticize me more and give me help sincerely!" I believe Mr. Hu Feng has seen these words. But at that time, Mr. Hu Feng didn't know what he thought of this "sincere" review. Later, Mr. A Long changed his mind, violating the "sincere" promise he had reviewed in front of the broad masses of readers, and wanted "People's Daily" to give him "equal treatment" and publish his rebuttal to Chen and Shi's articles. In order to adhere to the principle, "People's Daily" refused to publish it. Mr. Hu Feng, as a "familiar friend" of Mr. A Long, must have known about the occurrence of this incident. Then why didn't Mr. Hu Feng, who claims to be a "Marxist," help Mr. A Long to judge right and wrong in a timely manner based on the principles of Marxism at that time? Lenin said in his article "Party Organization and Party Literature" in 1905: "What is the principle of this Party literature? It is not just that for the socialist proletariat, literary undertakings cannot be a tool for individuals or groups to make money, but it can never be a personal undertaking unrelated to the overall cause of the proletariat." Comrade Lenin went on to say: "What! Perhaps some intellectuals, free and enthusiastic supporters, will shout. What! You want to subordinate such a delicate personal undertaking of literary creation to collectivity! ... You deny the absolute freedom of absolutely personal ideological creation!" Comrade Lenin then pointed out: "——Be quiet, gentlemen! First, we are talking about Party literature and its obedience to Party supervision. Everyone is free to write and say everything he wants to write and say, without any restrictions. But every free association (including the Party) also has the freedom to drive away members who use the Party's banner to advocate anti-Party views." Comrade Lenin asserted: "Freedom of thought and freedom of criticism within the Party will never make us forget that people have the freedom to gather into free groups called parties."
    "Your words about absolute freedom are just hypocrisy." [2] Don't these precious maxims of Lenin incisively point out to us that the freedom of speech in literature must be established under the premise of not violating the principles of the Party? Since this is the case, then what is so strange about "People's Daily," as a Party newspaper, not publishing Mr. A Long's article that violates the principles of the Party and attempts to achieve the "purpose" of "personal undertakings unrelated to the overall cause of the proletariat"?
    But in fact, Mr. Hu Feng was surprised and fiercely brought up this matter in an exaggerated manner as a threat to the criticism and accusations of "Literary Gazette" and the Party newspaper. What is Mr. Hu Feng's intention? There are no more than the following two points: First, to make unprincipled attacks on Comrade Yuan Shuibai, and in fact on "People's Daily," in order to satisfy the "personal career" requirements of his "familiar friend" Mr. A Long. Therefore, he unscrupulously filled his speech with such arguments: "People's Daily" had already begun to "suppress" new forces and "hostilize" "revolutionary writers" as early as 1950. You see, Mr. A Long, a "revolutionary writer" who has been "pursuing revolution for more than ten years," has been "suppressed to the point where he can't breathe." Second, through the attack on Comrade Yuan Shuibai, and in fact on "People's Daily," he attempted to create a gloomy smoke screen in the struggle movement against Hu Shi's bourgeois idealism: that is, the erroneous behavior of the bourgeois aristocratic style of "suppressing" new forces is not only a problem of "Literary Gazette," but also a problem of the Party newspaper. Everyone, look! It has been almost five years, and even the "revolutionary writers" of many years have been "suppressed" and "destroyed" by that Party. In this way, the broad masses can be misled, the direction of the struggle can be shifted, and the spearhead is no longer aimed at bourgeois idealism, but at the Party newspaper. In this way, this "fact" can be used to confirm the decadent argument in Mr. Hu Feng's own speech: "In any case, this is a failure on our front." Isn't this precisely the vicious intention of Mr. Hu Feng to pull out Mr. A Long as the only basis for his argument in this movement? Therefore, it is not difficult for us to see that Mr. Hu Feng's speech this time is completely based on unprincipled "personal prejudices," and his intentions are not good, attempting to shift the development of the movement, confuse the masses, distract the masses, and change the direction of the struggle through his speech. Is this kind of provocative behavior tolerable to us?
    Mr. Hu Feng may also ask back: "Isn't there anything commendable in my speech? Didn't I also say words like 'supporting' President Guo Moruo's speech?" Yes, these words were said, and no one has denied it. However, what is the criterion for us to judge whether a speech is correct or not? Is it individual, fragmented, and only beautiful words used to decorate the facade? Or is it the "general tendency" as pointed out by Comrade Stalin in his letter to Felix Cohn on July 9, 1929? There is no doubt that we must judge right and wrong based on the "general tendency." But what is the "general tendency" revealed in Mr. Hu Feng's speech? Nothing else, just trying to shift our struggle goals and hoping for our struggle to fail. Therefore, Mr. Hu Feng's remarks must be severely refuted.
    Here, we can also use the same method to examine Mr. A Long's article. Although Mr. A Long has made some criticisms of Zhu Guangqian's reactionary aesthetic ideology, the "general tendency" revealed in Mr. A Long's article mentioned by Mr. Hu Feng is the distortion of Marxism and the violation of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic line. How can such an article and its author be "guaranteed" not to be criticized by the masses? However, today Mr. Hu Feng arrogantly uses this as a threat and maliciously criticizes the Party newspaper. This exaggeration and unfounded criticism is essentially just something from "the kitchen of manufacturing cheap sensational things" [3], as Comrade Stalin said in 1928, and cannot withstand a single refutation.
    The reason why Mr. Hu Feng revealed this suspicious tone in this speech has its certain historical roots. "People's Daily" clearly pointed out the erroneous essence of the literary and artistic thoughts of Hu Feng and his small group in the editor's note when it reprinted Comrade Shu Wu's review article "Learning from Scratch 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art'" on June 8, 1952, believing that "it is a kind of literary and artistic thought that essentially belongs to bourgeois and petty-bourgeois individualism." But at that time, it did not arouse Mr. Hu Feng's serious attention. In order to better help Mr. Hu Feng face up to his mistakes, the Party later specially held several symposiums for Mr. Hu Feng, pointing out the mistakes of Mr. Hu Feng. However, Mr. Hu Feng only made some reviews on individual issues, but did not correct his mistakes from the fundamental issues. In order to further remind Mr. Hu Feng to reflect on himself, "Literary Gazette" also published Comrade Lin Mohan's "Hu Feng's Anti-Marxist Literary and Artistic Thoughts" and Comrade He Qifang's "The Road of Realism, or the Road of Anti-Realism" in its second and third issues in 1953, analyzing and criticizing the essence of Mr. Hu Feng's anti-Marxist literary and artistic thoughts, and pointing out that the root cause of his erroneous literary and artistic thoughts lies in his consistent adoption of a non-class viewpoint in dealing with literary and artistic issues. But so far, Mr. Hu Feng has not only not corrected this erroneous literary and artistic thought, but has allowed it to develop, so that in this speech, due to the adoption of a non-class viewpoint to deal with literary and artistic issues, this tone has been revealed. Its purpose is as Comrade Zhou Yang pointed out in his article "We Must Fight," attempting to "disarm us of Marxism" and lead to the "failure" of our struggle, which is worthy of our hundredfold vigilance.
    Finally, I appeal to the Presidium of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association to take necessary measures quickly, make a correct evaluation of this movement based on Mr. Hu Feng's erroneous remarks, and conduct a solemn criticism to clarify the harmful influence caused by Mr. Hu Feng's vulgar views of subjective idealism, which are indistinguishable between right and wrong, reverse black and white, only see the occurrence of the mistakes of "Literary Gazette," and do not see the correction of the mistakes, and criticize Mr. Hu Feng's provocative style, which attempts to blur the vision of the masses, shift the direction of the struggle, and essentially disarm us of Marxism.

    胡风先生的立场是什么
    ——读胡风先生在中国文学艺术界联合会主席团和中国作家协会主席团扩大联席会议上的发言
    周姬昌
    最近，中国文学艺术界联合会主席团和中国作家协会主席团召开了扩大联席会议，对“文艺报”全面地进行了检查。会上很多作家就“文艺报”五年来所犯的错误发了言，胡风先生也先后两次在会上发了言。但是，我认为胡风先生的发言所持的立场是不正确的。
    首先需要指出的，就是胡风先生对于这次因俞平伯先生研究“红楼梦”的错误思想而引起的整个文艺界总动员起来向盘踞在文学艺术领域中的资产阶级唯心论进行激烈的斗争和对“文艺报”所犯的错误得到纠正这一新的情况的看法是和我们不一致的。
  　我们知道，俞平伯先生研究“红楼梦”的错误思想长期以来未被揭发，表明了胡适派反动的资产阶级唯心论在我们古典文学的研究领域中占据着重要的地盘而始终未被摧毁。因此，今天由李希凡、蓝翎两同志高举着马克思列宁主义的大旗而首先发难的对资产阶级思想的批判，就有它特别重大的意义。正如中国文学艺术界联合会主席郭沫若同志在他的“三点建议”的发言中所指出的：“这一次的讨论是富有教育意义的，是马克思主义对资产阶级唯心论的严重的思想斗争，是思想改造的自我教育的继续开展，是适应当前国家过渡时期总任务的文化动员。”事实也是如此，全国各地的文化及教育部门都十分重视，先后开始进行了讨论。无论是作家、教授、科学工作者或新闻工作者，他们都严正地批判了和斥责了资产阶级唯心论的荒谬的论点，并用实际行动投入到这一具有深刻的历史意义的运动中去。从全国许多地方，从党内到党外，从青年人到老年人，大家都已经积极地行动起来了，在和资产阶级唯心论进行激烈的斗争中，形成了一条坚强的统一战线，而这条战线是以马克思列宁主义武器来装备的，因此，它就必然攻无不克，战无不胜。事实证明，李希凡、蓝翎两同志投出的可贵的第一枪，已经命中了胡适派资产阶级唯心论的要害，难道这不正是标志着这次战斗胜利的开端吗？
    但是，我们看看胡风先生对于这次运动所抱的态度是怎样的？在他第二次发言中，劈头就说：
  “先说一点我的心情，‘文艺报’的问题发生以后，我个人的心情是沉重的。因为，无论如何，这是我们战线上的失败。失败是我们大家共同的，所以心情很沉重。有的同志说我上次发言很激动，是的，我是很激动的，这是从失败感来的，我没有能够控制自己。”（旁点是我加的——姬昌注。）这些消沉、沮丧、悲观的哀鸣能够说明什么呢？根据胡风先生的立论，“‘文艺报’的问题发生”，就意味着“我们战线上的失败”，而且还是“无论如何”。这里就不能不使人怀疑，胡风先生所说的“战线”，究竟是指什么样的“战线”，是马克思列宁主义的革命文艺战线呢？还是什么别的战线呢？
    什么是我们的战线呢？毛泽东同志早在一九四二年五月二十三日延安文艺座谈会上就明确地指出过：“我们的文艺既然是为人民大众的，那末，我们就可以进而讨论一个党内关系问题，党的文艺工作和党的整个工作的关系问题，和另一个党外关系的问题，党的文艺工作和非党的文艺工作的关系问题——文艺界统一战线问题。”还不明显吗？今天我们对胡适派资产阶级唯心论进行斗争的战线还不就是毛泽东同志所指出的紧密地团结着的党内外文艺工作者的统一战线吗？既然是这条战线，我们就有信心，我们的斗争一定胜利。事实胜于雄辩，所谓“‘文艺报’的问题发生”，只是表明了“文艺报”资产阶级的贵族老爷式的恶劣作风和它受到胡适派资产阶级错误思想的袭击而向它投降。当这种错误思想作风受到马克思列宁主义的思想的批判，“文艺报”编辑部进行了检查和自我批评，只是表明了由于党的坚强领导，而使“文艺报”脱离了错误的泥坑而走向新生，并且，也只是表明了文艺界的统一战线在和资产阶级斗争中获得一次空前重大的胜利。因此，我们正应该向文艺界祝贺，向“文艺报”祝贺。生活在毛泽东时代里的只要是有些觉悟的人都会有这样的“心情”，当别人的或者自己的错误得到纠正并且走向新生的时候，总是高兴的。只有那种坚持错误、坚决不接受批评、沾染着资产阶级唯心论思想极其深重并顽固不化的人，才会感到心情沉重与难过，甚至憎恨。
    今天，“文艺报”在接受党报的批评后，已经积极进行检查。“文艺报”的主编冯雪峰同志和编辑部已经作了公开的检讨，并表示决心改进工作，我们有什么理由不欢迎呢？我们有什么理由要对他们——进行自我批评的同志们泼冷水呢？我们正应该多方面加以关怀，帮助他们更深刻地检查思想，并且积极地鼓舞他的战斗热情，指出他认识到自己的错误就是我们战线上的胜利。这样，对于犯错误的同志来说，是温暖的，善意的。毛泽东同志曾经诚恳地告诫我们：“任何犯错误的人，只要他不讳疾忌医，不固执错误，以至于达到不可救药的地步，而且老老实实，真正愿意医治，愿意改正，我们就要欢迎他，把他的毛病治好，使他变为一个好同志。”〔一〕
    但是胡风先生是怎样的呢？他一方面把“文艺报”的错误夸大为“我们战线上的失败”，甚至是
  “无论如何”；一方面向已经公开检讨错误的同志泼冷水。他非但没有对他们在认识了错误的时候，用热情的话语加以关怀与鼓舞，反而用廉价的同情和怜悯的眼泪去作虚伪的安慰，沮丧地为之“难过”。试问胡风先生说这些话的居心何在？立场何在？
    为了更好地弄清问题，我们还可以从别的方面来证实胡风先生的立场不稳，不是一个货真价实的马克思主义者。
    当这一次运动轰轰烈烈地开始了的时候，很多作家、教授及有关人士都自觉地组织起来进行讨论与批判。但胡风先生一开始就表现了十分被动与懒散的态度。我们还是用他自己的话来分析吧！他抱怨地说：“在上次开会以前，作家协会一位负责同志劝我写文章，陈企霞同志也约我写文章。”接着勉强地说：“既然同志们这样诚恳地对待这个问题，
  　我就翻阅了一下一、二两卷的‘文艺报’。”（旁点都是我加的——姬昌注。）这些话的意思就是说，如果作家协会的负责同志和陈企霞同志不来“约”他，甚至是“劝”他，他就不会认为同志们是“诚恳地对待这个问题”。或者，他“就”连“翻”也不“翻”“文艺报”一下。
    作为一个作家，面对着这样一场轰轰烈烈的思想斗争的场面，采取一种消沉懈怠的态度，是能令人容忍的吗？作为一个作家，正应该把斗争看成主要东西。但胡风先生是怎样的呢？他明知道这一次斗争的意义非常深重，而他非但没有把自觉地参加斗争作为己任，反而有意表现了十分松弛懒散的态度，“既然”“约我”，“劝我”，“我就……”，口气是那样勉强，甚至有点抱怨，这种态度的产生，不正是由他的“失败感来的”吗？这里也就不难看出，胡风先生决不是一个真正的马克思主义者。因为一个真正懂得马克思主义的人，他在任何场合都会表现出高度的战斗的政治热情。但胡风先生面临着这样一场斗争场面，非但没有丝毫政治热情，甚至连他自己所一向标榜的“主观战斗精神”也不知到哪里去了。而他只是感到“战线上的失败”，给这次运动的评价作了严重的歪曲，这是不能容忍的。
    这里，我们还可以从另一方面来说明胡风先生对于这次运动所抱的态度不真诚，即使说他借故生端也未必过分。在胡风先生的发言中，用了大量的言辞指摘“文艺报”于一九五○年转载了“人民日报”“人民文艺”上所刊登的关于陈涌、史笃两同志批评阿垅先生的文章，并认为这是对进步作家和新生力量的“打击”、“压制”和“敌视”。我认为这也是对“文艺报”进行严重的歪曲与诽谤，并颠倒黑白，混淆是非，模糊了广大群众的眼睛，从而转移了斗争的方向。这里，首先需要弄清楚的就是：“文艺报”转载“人民日报”的文章并加了按语，究竟是不是错误的行为。关于这一问题，我觉得稍具政治热情的人都可以看得出来。“文艺报”非但没有做错，相反地，“文艺报”却恰恰在这一件事上十分正确地表现了支持与符合了党的意图，帮助党进一步廓清了由于阿垅先生“对马克思主义作了歪曲”而在群众中造成的不良的影响，这样做难道有错吗？“文艺报”转载了“人民日报”的文章，表明了“文艺报”相信党报，相信党，这样做并没有错。况且“人民日报”所刊登的陈、史文章基本上是正确的，它廓清了由于阿垅先生歪曲马克思主义而造成的错误的影响；对阿垅先生所倡议的所谓“艺术即政治”和实质上是否定描写“正面人物”的荒谬论点进行了严厉的批判，从而进一步阐明了文艺为工农兵服务的方向。这种批评不是对人民有好处吗？不是维护了人民的和党的文艺方针吗？因此，“文艺报”转载了它，是完全应该的。但胡风先生却据此来批评“文艺报”是“压制小人物”，这不正是严重的歪曲和严重的诽谤吗？
    阿垅先生在一九五○年三月二十六日的“人民日报”上对陈、史两同志批评他的文章曾经作过公开的检讨，并表示态度说：“我要好好进行检讨，和完全接受指摘。”“错误在我，请多批评，给我帮助，真诚地！”这些话我相信胡风先生是看到过的。但当时胡风先生对于这个“真诚”的检讨不知是怎样想的。后来阿垅先生变了卦，违反了他自己原来在广大读者面前检讨过的“真诚”的诺言，要
  “人民日报”给他以“平等待遇”，刊登他反驳陈、史的文章。“人民日报”为了坚持原则，不予刊登。这件事的发生，作为阿垅先生的“熟识的朋友”的胡风先生想必总是知道的。那么自命为“马克思主义者”的胡风先生为什么在当时不及时根据马克思主义的原则帮助阿垅先生判辨是非呢？列宁在一九○五年“党的组织和党的文学”一文中说：“这个党的文学的原则是什么呢？这不只是说，对于社会主义的无产阶级，文学事业不但不能是个人或集团的赚钱的工具，而且它永远不能是与无产阶级总的事业无关的个人事业。”列宁同志接着说：“怎么！也许某个知识分子，自由的热烈拥护者，会叫喊起来。怎么！你想使文学创作这样精致的个人事业服从于集体性呀！……你否认绝对个人的思想创作的绝对自由呀！”列宁同志接着指出：“——安静些，先生们！第一、我们说的是党的文学及其对于党的监督之服从。每个人都有自由写他所愿意写的和说他所愿意说的一切，没有丝毫的限制。但是每个自由的结社（党也包括在内）同样也有自由赶走利用党的招牌来鼓吹反党的观点的成员。”列宁同志断言说：“党内的思想自由和批评自由永远不会使我们忘记人们有集合成号称为党的自由团体的自由。”
  “你们那些关于绝对自由的话不过是一种伪善而已。”〔二〕列宁的这些宝贵的铭言不是一针见血地给我们指出了文学的言论自由必须是在不违背党的原则的前提下而确立的吗？既然如此，那么作为党报的“人民日报”不刊登阿垅先生的违背了党的原则并企图达到“与无产阶级总的事业无关的个人事业”的“目的”的文章，那有什么可以奇怪的呢？
    但是事实上胡风先生却感到惊奇，大惊小怪地凶狠地把这件事提出来作为对“文艺报”和党报批评与指摘的要挟。胡风先生的用意何在呢？不外于以下两点：第一、对袁水拍同志、实际上是对“人民日报”作无原则的攻讦，用以达到满足他“熟识的朋友”阿垅先生的“个人事业”要求。因此，他就不择手段地在他的发言中充满着这样的论调：“人民日报”早在一九五○年就已开始“压制”新生力量与“敌视”“革命作家”了。你们看，“追求革命十多年”的“革命作家”阿垅先生已被“压得喘不过气来了”。第二、通过对袁水拍同志、实际上是对“人民日报”的攻讦，企图在对胡适派资产阶级唯心论的斗争运动中造成一派阴霾的烟幕：即“压制”新生力量这一资产阶级贵族老爷式的错误的行为，不仅是“文艺报”的问题，而且是党报的问题了。大家看呀！已经快五年了，连多年的“革命作家”都被那个党“压”得“毁灭”了。这样，就可以使广大群众造成了错觉，转移了斗争的方向，于是枪口不再是对着资产阶级唯心论，而正是对着党报。这样，就可以通过这一“事实”，来证实胡风先生自己发言中的腐朽的论调：“无论如何，这是我们战线上的失败”。这不正是胡风先生之所以在这次运动中把阿垅先生拉出来作为自己立论的唯一依据的恶毒用意吗？因此，我们不难看出，胡风先生这次的发言是完全抱有毫无原则的“个人成见”的，并且居心不善，企图由于通过他的发言，来转移运动的发展，蒙混群众的视听，分散群众的注意力，改变斗争的方向。这种挑衅式的行为，是我们能够容忍的吗？
    胡风先生也许还会反问：“难道我的发言没有一点可取的地方吗？我不是也说过‘拥护’郭沫若院长的谈话之类的话吗？”是的，这些话是说过，也并没有人否认过。但是，我们判断一篇言论正确与否的准则是什么呢？是个别的、支离的、仅仅是装饰门面用的漂亮的词藻呢？还是如斯大林同志在
  一九二九年七月九日给费里克斯·康同志的信中所指出的“总的倾向”呢？没有疑问，我们是要根据“总的倾向”来判断是非的。但胡风先生在发言中所流露出来的“总的倾向”又是什么呢？没有别的，仅仅是企图转移我们的斗争目标和指望我们的斗争失败而已。因此，胡风先生的言论是必须加以严厉驳斥的。
    这里，我们还可以用同样的方法来检验阿垅先生的文章。虽然，阿垅先生曾经对朱光潜的反动的美学思想作过一些批判，但在胡风先生所提到的阿垅先生的文章中所流露出来的“总的倾向”却是歪曲了马克思主义和违反了毛泽东的文艺路线，这样的文章和它的作者怎么能“保证”不受到群众的批评呢？然而今天胡风先生竟狂妄地以此作为要挟，诬蔑性地指摘党报。这种夸大和不着边际的指摘，实质上只是如斯大林同志在一九二八年所说的来自
  “制造廉价的耸动听闻的东西底厨房”〔三〕里的东西，是经不起一驳的。
    胡风先生在这次发言中之所以会流露出这种可疑的口吻，是有他一定的历史根源的。“人民日报”早在一九五二年六月八日转载舒芜同志的检讨文章“从头学习‘在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话’”时就曾在编者按语中明确地指出胡风及其小集团的文艺思想的错误实质，认为“是一种实质上属于资产阶级、小资产阶级的个人主义的文艺思想”。但当时并没有引起胡风先生的严重注意。党为了更好地帮助胡风先生正视自己的错误，后来又特地为胡风先生召开了几次座谈会，正面指出胡风先生的错误所在。但胡风先生仍只是在个别问题上作了一些检讨，却没有从根本问题上来纠正自己的错误。为了进一步提醒胡风先生有以自省，“文艺报”在一九五三年也先后在第二、第三期上连期发表了林默涵同志的“胡风的反马克思主义的文艺思想”和何其芳同志的
  “现实主义的路，还是反现实主义的路”两文，分析批判了胡风先生的反马克思主义的文艺思想的实质，指出了他的文艺思想的错误根源即在于一贯采取了非阶级的观点来对待文艺问题。但胡风先生迄今为止，非但没有纠正这种错误的文艺思想，反而任其发展，以致在这次发言中由于采取了非阶级的观点来对待文艺问题而流露出这种口吻。其目的诚如周扬同志在“我们必须战斗”一文中所指出的企图给我们“解除马克思主义的武装”，导致我们斗争的“失败”，这是值得我们百倍警惕的。
    最后，我吁请中国文学艺术界联合会主席团和中国作家协会主席团，迅速采取必要的措施，根据胡风先生错误的言论进行严正的批判，并对这次运动作出正确的评价，以廓清因胡风先生的是非不分、颠倒黑白、只看到“文艺报”错误的发生、不看到错误得到纠正而散布悲观气氛的本末倒置的主观唯心论的庸俗的看法而引起的有害的影响，并批判胡风先生企图模糊群众的视听、转移斗争的方向、实质上是给我们解除马克思主义武装的恶劣的挑衅式的作风。附
