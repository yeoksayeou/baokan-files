The Story of Miner Gao Cunfu, Li Bahai, and Others Capturing Saboteurs
贾玉江

    This happened in the seven-foot coal pit of the Yangquan Mining Bureau's Third Mine. Although it was in February of last year, the exemplary deeds of miners Gao Cunfu and others in vigilantly capturing saboteurs are worth learning from by the vast majority of employees. Gao Cunfu and Li Bahai, who worked as cart pushers, were stationed in the auxiliary tunnel below the pit. To reach the main tunnel from the auxiliary tunnel, one had to traverse a steeply inclined transport road and a switch leading to the main tunnel. Pushing carts on this stretch was dangerous, but because they were both experienced cart pushers with many years of experience, accidents such as derailments and disruptions to production never occurred. However, strange things happened one after another in February, with derailments occurring two or three times a day. Although Gao Cunfu repeatedly told Li Bahai to properly switch the tracks, accidents continued to happen. Therefore, Gao Cunfu became somewhat angry:
      "What's going on? You never switch the tracks properly. Don't you know how much delay a derailment causes to production?"
      "I switch them properly every time. Who knows why it keeps derailing?" Li Bahai also felt strange, because he was very careful every time he switched the tracks, especially these past few days. After switching the tracks, he would carefully check them again until he was sure there would be no mistake before walking away. But derailments were still unavoidable. He thought, "There's a ghost here. It must be saboteurs causing trouble." But he wasn't sure, so he didn't immediately tell Gao Cunfu, only saying:
      "Let's nail a nail next to the switch. That way, even if it's harder to switch, it's guaranteed not to derail again."
    With a nail nailed next to the switch, Gao Cunfu felt much more at ease. When he pushed the second cart to the slope of the gun track switch, he boldly let the coal cart go down. Li Bahai, because he suspected saboteurs were at work, leaned over to look as the coal cart approached the gun track switch. Sure enough, he saw that the switch had moved four or five centimeters away from the track. At this time, the coal cart was already halfway down the slope. Li Bahai knew that the coal cart couldn't be stopped and an accident would happen, so he shouted urgently:
      "Danger!"
    With the shout, Li Bahai jumped off the cart, and the coal cart rolled down the slope with a "boom." Thanks to Gao Cunfu's experience in pushing carts, he cleverly dodged to the side when he heard Li Bahai's shout, only suffering a fall.
     "That was close! I almost lost my head!" Gao Cunfu was a little nervous, but also felt strange, so he said: "How can it still derail even with a nail nailed?"
    Li Bahai explained his thoughts: "I think there must be bad people here, otherwise the switch would never move on its own after being nailed."
    Upon hearing this, Gao Cunfu remembered what the Party branch secretary and the security section chief often said: "We are building socialism, but the imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang don't want that. Their running dogs—special agents—will try to lurk within us, constantly attempting to sabotage our construction efforts. Therefore, we must be vigilant and guard against the enemy's conspiracies and sabotage..."
      "The person doing this must be in one of the nearby groups," Li Bahai continued, without waiting for Gao Cunfu to speak.
      "Yes," Gao Cunfu replied, but he was still thinking about his own concerns. The more he thought about it, the more he felt that Li Bahai's words made sense, so he leaned closer to Li Bahai and whispered:
       "I'm afraid Zhang Tongyuan is doing this."
      "Zhang Tongyuan? The Zhang Tongyuan who just started working recently?"
    "Yes!" Gao Cunfu looked around and lowered his voice, saying: "This guy is from the same hometown as me. When the Japanese devils occupied our hometown, his uncle became a traitor and helped the devils kill many of our anti-Japanese cadres. After the devils surrendered, he turned to Yan Xishan, oppressing the common people. After liberation, he was suppressed by the People's Government. Zhang Tongyuan is dissatisfied with the government and often says inappropriate things. Recently, he started working here and often comes and goes in this lane. I think he must be the one sabotaging the switch."
    Li Bahai, hearing this, felt it made sense and continued:
      "We never had accidents before Zhang Tongyuan came. But since he started working, derailments have been happening continuously. He must be doing it. Let's report to the security section quickly!"
      "Let's report after work!" Gao Cunfu said. "Now, let's hide and watch. If we can catch him in the act, that would be even better."
      "Okay," Li Bahai said, and ran into the work face to call out Jing Lagui to discuss the matter.
    Jing Lagui was the production team leader of this shift. These days, because the coal carts had been derailing repeatedly, the production tasks could not be completed well, and he was very anxious. He knew that Gao Cunfu and Li Bahai were two experienced cart pushers, and accidents rarely happened before. He felt very strange about the sudden and continuous accidents these days, and also thought that it might be bad people causing trouble. Now, after hearing Gao Cunfu and Li Bahai's words, he felt they were right and said:
      "But it's best not to delay production. You two go back to pushing carts, and I'll hide here and keep an eye out."
    Gao Cunfu and Li Bahai tidied up the coal cart and pushed it towards the main tunnel. They hadn't gone far when they saw Zhang Tongyuan walking out of the main tunnel. Zhang Tongyuan walked near the switch, looked around, and then took down his headlamp to shine it towards the main tunnel. Gao Cunfu and Li Bahai quickly slipped to the side. Jing Lagui, seeing Zhang Tongyuan sneaking to the gun track switch, also quickly turned off his headlamp and hid behind a pillar. Zhang Tongyuan, seeing that there was no one around, boldly ran over and wanted to switch the tracks; but he never expected that as he was bending over to switch the tracks, his hands were tightly grabbed by Jing Lagui.
      "What are you doing?" Jing Lagui shouted loudly.
    "I, I," Zhang Tongyuan felt that things were not good and stuttered a little, but still wanted to deny it: "I dropped my hat!"
      "The ground is full of water, but your hat is dry and has no water on it at all. How can you be picking up your hat?" Jing Lagui pressed him tightly.
    At this time, Gao Cunfu and Li Bahai quickly ran over and grabbed Zhang Tongyuan together. Workers from nearby groups, hearing that a saboteur had been caught, also ran over one after another. ………………
    In the security section, Zhang Tongyuan confessed to sabotaging the switch. Then the workers also reported that he had also sabotaged switches and electric drill wires in the southeastern main tunnel of the Second Mine, and had stolen things from worker Cui Chengxiang's house. Facing the criminal facts reported by the workers, Zhang Tongyuan could not deny them and had to admit them one by one.
    The deeds of Gao Cunfu, Li Bahai, and Jing Lagui in capturing the saboteur quickly spread. The mine also held a staff meeting to reward their exemplary actions in protecting the mine. The Party general branch secretary and the mine director both spoke at the meeting, calling on everyone to learn from them, increase their vigilance a hundredfold, and do a good job in preventing spies and theft.
      Since then, the mass security work in Yangquan Third Mine has entered a new stage. In just one month, workers have automatically solved eleven major and minor sabotage and theft cases.

    矿工高存福李八孩等捕捉破坏分子的故事
    贾玉江
    这件事发生在阳泉矿务局第三矿的七尺煤坑里。虽然是去年二月间的事，但矿工高存福等机警地捕捉破坏分子的模范事迹，是值得广大职工学习的。推车工人高存福和李八孩工作的地点，是在坑下的副巷。从副巷往大巷去，要经过一段坡度很大的运搬路和通向正巷的枪道岔。在这一段路上推车很危险，但因为他俩都是有多年丰富经验的推车工人，从来没有发生过翻车、落道等生产中断事故。可是二月间却连连发生怪事，每天要发生两三次落道事故。高存福虽然再三告诉李八孩把道岔扳好，但还照样发生事故。因此高存福就有些生气了：
      “怎闹的？每次都不把道岔扳好，你不知道落一次道对生产有多大耽误吗？”
      “我每次都扳得好好的，谁知道为啥又落道了呢？”李八孩也感到奇怪，因为他每次扳道岔都很细心，特别是这几天，扳过道岔还再仔细地看一看，一直到认为不会出错时才走开。但是落道事故还是免不了。他想：“这里有鬼，准是破坏分子在捣乱。”但他还不敢肯定，就没有马上告诉高存福，只说：
      “咱们在道岔边钉个钉子吧，这样扳的时候虽然费劲，可是保险不会再落道了。”
    道岔边上钉上了钉子，高存福放心多了，第二趟车推到枪道岔的坡上时，就大着胆子把煤车放下去；李八孩因为怀疑有破坏分子捣鬼，因此当煤车快要接近枪道岔时，就歪着身子看过去，果然他看见道岔又离开了铁道四五公分。这时候煤车已经放到了半坡上，李八孩知道煤车闸不住就要发生事故，于是急忙大喊：
      “危险呀！”
    随着喊声，李八孩跳下车来，煤车也“轰隆”一声翻滚到坡下。高存福多亏推车有经验，当听到李八孩喊声后，就机智地往旁边一闪，只摔了一下。
     “好危险呀！差点儿这颗脑袋就交代啦！”高存福有些紧张，但又觉着奇怪，就说：“怎么钉上钉子，还要落道呀？”
    李八孩说出了自己的想法：“我看这里一定有坏人，不然钉上钉子，道岔绝不会自己跑开。”
    李八孩这一说，高存福想起党支部书记和保卫科长经常说的话：“我们要建设社会主义，帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮却不愿意，他们的走狗——特务分子，会设法潜伏在我们内部，时时刻刻企图破坏我们的建设事业，因此我们必须提高警惕，严防敌人的阴谋破坏……。”
      “干这事的人，一定在附近这几个组里。”李八孩不等高存福吭声，又接着说。
      “对，”高存福虽这样回答了一声，但还在想他的心事。他越想，越觉着李八孩的话有道理，就凑近李八孩悄悄地说：
       “这事情恐怕是张同元干的。”
      “张同元？就是最近才上班的那个张同元吗？”
    “是呀！”高存福向四下看了看，压低了声音说：“这家伙和我是同乡，日本鬼子占领我们家乡时，他伯父当了汉奸，曾帮助鬼子杀害了咱们好些抗日干部；鬼子投降后，又投靠阎锡山，欺压老百姓，解放以后就被人民政府镇压了。张同元对政府不满，经常说些不三不四的话，最近他到了这里上班，又经常在这条巷道上来往，我看道岔准是他破坏的。”
    李八孩听了这话，觉着有道理，就接着说：
      “张同元没来以前，咱们没有发生过事故，可是自他一上班，落道事故就接连不断地发生了，这一定是他干的，咱们赶快向保卫科报告吧！”
      “下了班再去报告吧！”高存福说：“现在咱们躲藏起来，如果能当场把他抓住，那就更好了。”
      “好，”李八孩说着，就跑进掌子里叫出荆拉贵来商量。
    荆拉贵是这个班的生产小组长。这几天因为煤车一再发生落道事故，生产任务不能很好完成，也非常着急。他知道高存福、李八孩是两个推车有经验的老手，以前又很少发生事故，对这几天突然连续发生事故，感到非常奇怪，也想到过这可能是坏人捣鬼。现在他听了高存福和李八孩的话，觉着很对，就说：
      “不过最好是不要耽误了生产，你俩去继续推车，我在这里躲起来看住点。”
    高存福、李八孩把煤车收拾起来，向着大巷推去，刚走不远，就看见张同元从正巷走出来。张同元走到道岔附近，朝四下看了看，又拿下头灯来，对着大巷照了照。高存福、李八孩就急忙闪到一边。荆拉贵看到张同元鬼鬼祟祟地走到枪道岔上，也连忙把头灯扭灭，躲在柱子背后。张同元看着四下没人，就大着胆子跑去，想把道岔扳开；但他万没想到正在弯着腰扳道岔时，他的双手却被荆拉贵紧紧地抓住了。
      “你干什么？”荆拉贵大声喊。
    “我，我，”张同元觉着事情不妙，说话也有点结结巴巴了，但仍想抵赖：“我帽子掉了！”
      “地下满是水，你帽子干干的，一点水也不带，怎么能是拿帽子？”荆拉贵紧紧地追问。
    这时候，高存福、李八孩就急忙跑过来，一起把张同元捉住。附近各组工人听说抓住了破坏分子，也都纷纷跑来。………………
    在保卫科，张同元承认了破坏道岔的罪行。接着工人们又检举了他在二坑东南大巷时也曾破坏过道岔和电钻线，并偷过工人崔成祥家里的东西。对于工人们检举的这些犯罪事实，张同元无法狡赖，只好一一承认了。
    高存福、李八孩、荆拉贵活捉破坏分子的事迹，很快就传开了。矿上并召开了职工大会，奖励他们这种保护矿山的模范行动，党总支书记和矿长都在会上讲了话，号召大家向他们学习，百倍地提高警惕，作好防奸、防盗工作。
      自此，阳泉三矿群众性的保卫工作，进入了一个新的阶段。在短短的一个月里，工人们自动破获的大小破坏、偷盗案件就有十一起。
