Introduction to the Contents of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" Chinese Edition, Issue 2, 1955

The Chinese edition of the Cominform organ "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" Issue 2, 1955, has been published.

This issue features an editorial entitled "Combating the Heinous Plans of Atomic Maniacs is the Cause of People of All Countries." The editorial points out: The aggressive bloc of the United States and other Western countries is intensifying its plot to escalate international tensions and prepare for a new war using weapons of mass destruction such as atomic and hydrogen bombs. Peace-loving people around the world cannot but feel deep concern and strong indignation about this. World public opinion is indignant to learn that the Council of the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization recently approved plans at its meeting in Paris to formulate plans for atomic warfare in Europe, and in fact gave American generals the "right" to arbitrarily decide when and where to use atomic bombs. At the same time, the ruling groups of the United States and Britain are trying their best to force Western European countries to accept the London and Paris Agreements. The ruling elements in Western countries also intend to hand over atomic weapons to the Hitlerite executioners through these agreements. Due to the adventurous policies of the heads of the North Atlantic bloc, the danger of launching an atomic war is much greater than before. This requires all peace-loving people to redouble their efforts to eliminate this threat to mankind. Peace-loving people can and must stop these atomic maniacs and force them to abandon their heinous plans. Resolute mass action by peace advocates and attracting more and more millions of people with very different political views and social status to participate in the struggle to ban atomic weapons will help to crush the conspiracy of the American atomic maniacs. As long as the people of all countries resolutely take on the cause of peace and defend it to the end, the deadly threat to mankind posed by the adventurous policies of the reactionaries in Western countries will surely be eliminated.

This issue contains the speech delivered by Khrushchev on January 7 at the meeting of the Komsomol members and youth applying to participate in reclamation work in Moscow City and Moscow Oblast, as well as an article by William Z. Foster, Chairman of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, entitled "The Danger of Militarism," and an article by Laurent Casanova, a member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, entitled "French Patriotic Forces Persist in the Struggle Against the Arming of West Germany," and others.

Foster's article emphasizes that the United States is building a huge military machine. In order to get the people to agree to, or rather tolerate, the establishment of such a huge armed force, some deceptive reasons are put forward. However, the facts are exactly the opposite of the militarists' claims. The large-scale stockpiling of armaments not only does not guarantee peace, but will directly lead to war. Imperialist militarism itself contains a serious danger of war. The Pentagon has gathered the most stubborn and dangerous warmongers in the United States into the General Staff. Almost every week, some of them make crazy warmongering remarks. The influence of the Pentagon's generals of the Army, Navy, and Air Force is growing in the formulation of American foreign policy, and they are a real threat to world peace. The workers' movement and the entire peace forces should redouble their efforts to oppose this threat. The political influence of the Pentagon must be curbed, and the Pentagon's behind-the-scenes war conspiracies must be exposed and opposed.

Casanova's article points out that the French people are continuing to wage selfless struggles against the reconstruction of the revanchist Wehrmacht. This struggle is developing and will become increasingly stronger. Starting in 1955, French patriots launched an even broader struggle. New struggle committees have been established in factories, towns, and villages, uniting patriots from all walks of life. Under the leadership of the Communists, patriots have entered a new stage of struggle with greater confidence than in the past, and they have greater confidence in changing the balance of power in the parliament. The Communist Party declares that it is ready to do everything in its power to help all workers, national, and democratic forces consolidate and expand unity. The united front of the French working people must become the foundation for the broad unity of all healthy forces in the country to fight together against the rearmament of West Germany and for the security of France.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五五年第二期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五五年第二期中文版已经出版。
    这一期以“反对原子狂人的罪恶计划是各国人民的事业”为题发表社论。社论指出：美国和其他西方国家的侵略集团变本加厉地阴谋加剧国际紧张局势，准备发动一场使用原子弹和氢弹这类大规模毁灭性武器的新战争；全世界爱好和平的人民对此不能不感到深切的忧虑和强烈的愤慨。世界公众愤慨地获悉，侵略性的北大西洋条约组织理事会最近在巴黎举行的会议上批准了制订在欧洲进行原子战争的计划，并且事实上给予美国将领任意决定在何时何地使用原子弹的“权利”。同时，美国和英国的统治集团竭力强迫西欧国家接受伦敦和巴黎协定。西方国家的统治分子还打算通过这些协定把原子武器交给希特勒刽子手。由于北大西洋集团的头子们的冒险政策，发动原子战争的危险比以前大得多。这就要求一切爱好和平的人民加倍努力来消除人类面前的这种威胁。爱好和平的人民能够而且必须制止这些原子狂人，强迫他们放弃他们的罪恶计划。和平拥护者采取坚决的群众性行动和吸引更多的千百万政见和社会地位极不相同的人参加禁止原子武器的斗争，将有助于粉粹美国原子狂人的阴谋。只要世界各国人民坚决地把和平事业担当起来并且把它保卫到底，就一定能消灭西方国家反动派的冒险政策所造成的对人类的致命威胁。
    这一期刊载了赫鲁晓夫一月七日在莫斯科市和莫斯科州申请参加开垦工作的共青团员和青年会议上发表的演说，也刊载了美国共产党全国委员会主席福斯特的题为“军国主义的危险”的文章，和法国共产党中央委员斐盖尔的题为“法国爱国力量坚持反对武装西德的斗争”的文章等。
    福斯特的文章着重指出，美国正在建立庞大的军事机器。为了要老百姓同意、或者说容忍建立这样庞大的武装力量，提出来一些欺骗性的理由。然而，事实是和军国主义分子的言论刚好相反的。大量地储存军备不但不能保障和平，而且会直接引起战争。帝国主义军国主义本身就包含严重的战争危险。五角大楼把美国最顽固最危险的好战分子搜罗在参谋总部里。几乎每一个星期他们当中都有人发表疯狂的好战言论。五角大楼的陆海空军将领们在制订美国外交政策方面的影响越来越大，他们是世界和平的真正威胁。工人运动和整个和平力量应当加倍努力地反对这种威胁。必须遏止五角大楼的政治影响，必须揭穿和反对五角大楼在幕后进行的战争阴谋。
    斐盖尔的文章指出，法国人民在继续进行忘我的斗争，反对重建复仇主义的国防军。这个斗争正在发展并将日益增强。从一九五五年开始，法国爱国者进行了更加广泛的斗争。新的斗争委员会纷纷在工厂、城镇和乡村中成立，团结了各方面的爱国人士。爱国人士在共产党人的领导下，怀着比过去更大的信心进入了斗争的新阶段，他们有更大的信心使议会中力量的对比发生变化。共产党宣布它准备竭尽一切力量来帮助全体工人、民族和民主力量巩固和扩大团结。法国劳动人民的统一战线必须成为全国一切健康力量广泛团结起来反对重新武装西德和争取法国安全而共同斗争的基础。（新华社）
