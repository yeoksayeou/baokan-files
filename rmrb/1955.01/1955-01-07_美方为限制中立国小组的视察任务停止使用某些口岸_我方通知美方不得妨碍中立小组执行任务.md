(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 6th) Chief delegate of the Korean-Chinese side of the Korean Military Armistice Commission, Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho, replied to the U.S. side's chief delegate, Carter, on January 5th regarding the U.S. notification to cease using certain South Korean ports for rotation and replacement, requesting the other party to take note that this cannot be used as a pretext to obstruct the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission from carrying out its missions as stipulated in the Armistice Agreement.

The U.S. side's chief delegate, Carter, had previously sent letters to the Korean-Chinese side on December 25th and December 30th, 1954, notifying them that the U.S. would, from January 1st, 1955, cease using all facilities at the airfields of Kunsan, Seoul, and Gangneung, as well as the ports of Kunsan and Gangneung, for rotation and replacement.

In his reply to Carter, Li Sang-cho stated: "I draw your attention to the fact that your measures must not become a pretext for restricting the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission stationed at each port from carrying out the tasks assigned to it by the Armistice Agreement; restricting the freedom and convenience necessary for the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to perform its duties; or shirking your responsibilities, as stipulated by the Armistice Agreement, to provide the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission with full protection, cooperation and assistance, logistical support, diplomatic privileges and treatment, and so on."

Li Sang-cho has already sent a copy of this letter to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

    美方为限制中立国小组的视察任务停止使用某些口岸
    我方通知美方不得妨碍中立小组执行任务
   【新华社开城六日电】朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将在一月五日就美方通知停止使用南朝鲜的某些口岸进行轮换和替换事函复美方首席委员卡特尔，要对方注意不能以这为借口妨碍中立国视察小组执行停战协定所规定的任务。
    美方首席委员卡特尔曾先后在一九五四年十二月二十五日和十二月三十日致函通知朝中方面说，美方将从一九五五年一月一日起，停止使用群山、汉城和江陵的飞机场以及群山、江陵两个港口的所有设备进行轮换替换。
    李相朝中将在给卡特尔的复信中说：我提起你方注意，你方的这种措施，不能成为借口，来限制驻在各口岸的中立国视察小组执行停战协定所给予它的任务；限制中立国视察小组为执行其职司所必需的自由与便利；或推卸根据停战协定的规定你方负有的给中立国视察小组充分保护、合作和协助、后勤支援、外交特权待遇等责任。
    李相朝中将已经把这封信的抄件一份送交给中立国监察委员会。
