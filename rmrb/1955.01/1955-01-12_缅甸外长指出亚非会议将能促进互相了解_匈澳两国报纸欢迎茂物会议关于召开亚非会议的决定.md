Xinhua News Agency, Eleventh Dispatch: Calcutta Message: Burmese Foreign Minister Sao Khun Kyi, speaking to reporters in Calcutta, India, on the tenth regarding the Asian-African Conference scheduled for April, said that the time has come for Asian countries to solve their own problems without Western interference. He also said that the Asian-African Conference should help the people of Asia and Africa understand each other and draw closer together. Sao Khun Kyi was passing through Calcutta on his way back to Rangoon from London.
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, Eleventh Dispatch: Budapest Message: The Hungarian newspaper "Free People's Daily" commented on the ninth on the Bogor Conference's decision to convene an Asian-African Conference, saying that the Bogor Conference's decision to convene the Asian-African Conference was aimed at advocating the continuous expansion of the idea of peaceful coexistence. Therefore, the Asian-African Conference will become an important factor in easing international tensions. "Free People's Daily" said that the Bogor Conference's decision to convene the Asian-African Conference aroused the anger of the colonialists. They are making every effort to undermine the conference and force certain countries to refuse to participate in the Asian-African Conference. However, the people of Asia and Africa are fully capable of defending the resolutions of the Bogor Conference.
    Xinhua News Agency, Eleventh Dispatch: Sydney Message: The Australian newspaper "Tribune" published an editorial on January 5th entitled "Asian-African Conference Can Strengthen Peace and Friendship," welcoming the Bogor Conference's decision to convene an Asian-African Conference.
    The editorial said that the Asian-African Conference would be an unprecedented initiative. The editorial said that most of the countries invited to participate in the Asian-African Conference have only recently freed themselves from colonialism or are in the process of freeing themselves from colonialism. They have never been allowed to meet to discuss their common problems in the past. The editorial pointed out that the Asian-African Conference will help the Asian and African people in their struggle for independence and liberation, and help strengthen the cause of world peace.
    The editorial pointed out that the imperialists are trying to oppose the Asian-African Conference. They are attempting to prevent those countries that will have representatives attending the Asian-African Conference from playing the role of independent countries in world affairs. The policy of the imperialists is, as the US government has stated, the policy of using "Asians to fight Asians." This policy is directly contradictory to the purpose of the Asian-African Conference. According to this policy, Taiwan has been occupied, Chiang Kai-shek's army is preparing to attack the mainland, the South Vietnamese army is being armed and trained by the United States, and weapons worth 500 million pounds will be supplied to Asian countries' governments willing to follow Wall Street's orders. The editorial pointed out, however, that Asians clearly see the imperialists' "Asians fighting Asians" policy.

    缅甸外长指出亚非会议将能促进互相了解
    匈澳两国报纸欢迎茂物会议关于召开亚非会议的决定
     【新华社十一日讯】加尔各答消息：缅甸外交部长藻昆卓十日在印度加尔各答向新闻记者发表谈话时谈到定于四月间举行的亚非会议时说，亚洲国家在没有西方的干涉的情况下解决它们自己的问题，现在已经是时候了。他又说，亚非会议应该帮助亚洲和非洲各国人民互相了解和更密切地接近起来。藻昆卓是在从伦敦回仰光途中经过加尔各答的。
    【新华社布拉格十一日电】布达佩斯消息：匈牙利“自由人民报”九日评论茂物会议关于召开亚非会议的决定说，茂物会议关于召开亚非会议，是为的倡议不断扩大和平共处的思想。因此，亚非会议将成为缓和国际紧张局势的一个重要因素。“自由人民报”说，茂物会议关于召开亚非会议的决定引起了殖民者的愤怒。他们极力企图破坏这个会议，并且强迫某些国家拒绝参加亚非会议。但是，亚洲和非洲人民是完全有力量来保卫茂物会议的决议的。
      【新华社十一日讯】悉尼消息：澳大利亚报纸“论坛报”一月五日以“亚非会议能够加强和平和友谊”为题发表社论，欢迎茂物会议关于召开亚非会议的决定。
    社论说，亚非会议将是史无前例的创举。社论说，被邀请参加亚非会议的大部分国家在最近才摆脱殖民主义，或者是正在摆脱殖民主义的。他们过去从来也没有被允许开会讨论他们共同的问题。社论指出，亚非会议将有助于亚非人民争取独立和解放的斗争，有助于世界和平事业的加强。
    社论指出，帝国主义者正在设法反对亚非会议。他们企图阻止那些将有代表出席亚非会议的国家在世界的事务中，起独立国家的作用。帝国主义者的政策就是如美国政府所表明过的用“亚洲人打亚洲人”的政策。这种政策是和亚非会议的目的直接矛盾的。根据这个政策，台湾被霸占了，蒋介石的军队正在准备进攻大陆，南越的军队正由美国武装和训练中，价值五亿英镑的武器将供给愿意照华尔街命令办事的亚洲国家政府。社论指出，但是，亚洲人是看得清楚帝国主义者的这种“亚洲人打亚洲人”的政策的。
