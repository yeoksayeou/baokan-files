    The textile worker Bai Xiuzhen was a roving worker in the roving section of the first workshop of the State-owned Shanghai Second Cotton Textile Factory. In the past, she had consistently violated labor discipline, and the following things often happened: she was several minutes late for work; she was not seen in the workshop; she left before the end of the shift. During production time, while others were concentrating on the machines, she ran around chatting. Several times she was suddenly nowhere to be found during production time, only to be discovered washing clothes in the toilet. Her work team held four meetings to criticize her for violating labor discipline. At each meeting, she readily promised to correct her behavior, but the next day she was back to her old ways. The workers in her work team were so angry that they criticized her mistakes at a factory-wide meeting. At that time, everyone wanted her to write a letter of guarantee, which she also agreed to do; after the meeting, however, she said to her fellow worker Wang Xiaomei: "Writing it is no big deal, it's not like I'm going to be beheaded!" In February of last year, the work team proposed that the oil waste per person should not exceed 1.4 percent, but at the end of the month, it was found that she alone had produced more than forty oil waste. All the workers in the team glared at her in anger, saying that she was "one rat spoiling the whole pot." They all demanded that she be handed over to the factory's Comrades' Tribunal for handling.

    After accepting the case, the Comrades' Tribunal conducted investigations from many sides. When Bai Xiuzhen heard that she was going to be put on trial, she was both a little scared and trying to figure out how to deal with it. When the comrades from the Comrades' Tribunal first talked to her, she met them with a confrontational attitude. But to Bai Xiuzhen's surprise, the comrade who talked to her pointed out her series of mistakes with patience and sincerity, and analyzed the harm of these mistakes. Bai Xiuzhen was secretly shocked. In the past, the team had only criticized her shortcomings in a piecemeal way; every time something happened, either the team criticized her or the general assembly criticized her, and there was rarely a systematic analysis and criticism of all her problems. In this conversation, although Bai Xiuzhen did not admit all the facts, she had realized that her problems were not small, and she began to worry that the Comrades' Tribunal would decide to fire her or punish her severely. After the first conversation, Bai Xiuzhen was so anxious that she did not eat for two days, but she was not thinking about how to recognize her mistakes, but how to deal with the trial. When the comrades from the Comrades' Tribunal talked to her for the second time, they focused on dispelling her ideological concerns, pointing out the direction of her efforts, and enlightening her ideologically by comparing the new and old societies. Bai Xiuzhen was an old worker, she had worked during the Japanese occupation and the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and later returned to the countryside because she could not make a living, and her past days were spent in hardship. She did not start working at the Second State Cotton Factory until shortly after the liberation of Shanghai. Now she had food and clothing, and her son was also in school. Before and after liberation were really two different worlds. After this conversation, Bai Xiuzhen struggled ideologically for several days.

    At this time, the comrades in Bai Xiuzhen's work team also held a team meeting to help her further recognize her mistakes. Everyone used the method of careful accounting to help her recognize the impact of violating labor discipline on production and the damage to the country; some comrades also reviewed the fact that they had not been patient enough in helping Bai Xiuzhen in the past. Seeing everyone helping her so sincerely, seriously and patiently, and seeing that everyone had first made self-criticisms, Bai Xiuzhen said with emotion and shame: "In the past, I only hoped that the country would become prosperous and that our lives would be better, but I didn't expect that if we don't produce well, we can't just wait for it." She also said: "Now I know that everyone is doing it for my own good. In the old society, if people didn't like you, they would have driven you out long ago. I also know that the Comrades' Tribunal is here to help me, not to send me to 'prison'." She made a preliminary self-criticism of her mistakes. That day, Bai Xiuzhen did not eat for another day. Chen A'si, the assistant in the workshop, helped her to get food, and everyone went to comfort her, making her feel the warmth between comrades. After work that day, she did not go home immediately, but wandered alone on the road. Gao Guifang, a worker in the same group, ran to comfort her, telling her that as long as she corrected her mistakes and made up for her faults, everyone would still trust her. The next morning, Bai Xiuzhen took the initiative to talk to Chen A'si, the assistant in the workshop, expressing her determination to correct her mistakes, and agreed to hold a Comrades' Tribunal to further educate her and everyone. At the Comrades' Tribunal, according to the mistakes she had made and the degree of recognition, it was decided to recommend that the administrative leaders give her a demerit record.

    After the trial, Bai Xiuzhen did change. She no longer arrived late or left early, violating labor discipline. The amount of defective yarn continued to decrease. When she encountered difficulties in production, she took the initiative to find the workers in the group to study and solve the problems. She also became more humble. Everyone was happy for her progress.

    同志审判会教育了白秀珍
    马超卿
    白秀珍是国营上海第二棉纺织厂一工场乙班粗纱间的挡车工，过去一贯不遵守劳动纪律，常常发生这样一些事情：上班时间已经过了好几分钟，在车间里还看不到她的影子；下班红灯没亮，她就走了。在生产时间，别人都聚精会神注意着机器，她却东奔西跑，找人谈“山海经”。有几次在生产时间忽然找不到她，后来竟发现她在厕所里洗衣服。为她不遵守劳动纪律，小组开过四次会批评她。每次会上，她满口答应改正，可是第二天还是老样子。小组工人气愤不过，在一次车间大会上对她的错误进行了批评。当时大家要她写保证书，她同样答应了；散会后，她却对同组工人王小妹说：“写就写，有什么了不起，又不是砍头！”去年二月份小组提出每人油纱不超过百分之一点四，到月底统计时，她一个人就出了四十多只油纱。全组工人气得直瞪眼，都说她是“一个老鼠害了一锅汤。”纷纷要求把她送交工厂的同志审判委员会处理。
    同志审判委员会接受了这个案件后，便多方面进行调查。白秀珍听说要对她进行审判，当时一方面有些害怕，另一方面却想办法来对付。当同志审判委员会的同志第一次找她谈话时，她怀着对抗情绪去见他。但出乎白秀珍的意料，找她谈话的同志却用耐心、诚恳的态度指出她一系列的错误，并分析这些错误的危害性。白秀珍暗暗吃惊。因为过去组里对她的缺点是零敲碎打，每次出了事，不是小组批评就是大会批评，很少把她的全部问题作系统的分析、批判。在这次的谈话中，白秀珍虽然没承认全部事实，但已经意识到自己的问题不小，她开始顾虑同志审判会上会不会决定开除她或者重重地惩罚她。第一次谈话结束后，白秀珍急得两天没吃饭，但她想的还不是怎样认识错误，而是如何来对付这次的审判。同志审判委员会的同志第二次找她谈话时，着重解除她的思想顾虑，指出她努力的方向，并用新旧社会对比的方式从思想上开导她。白秀珍原是老工人，她在日寇占领时期和国民党反动派统治时期都做过工，后来因为生活过不下去回到乡下，过去的日子都是在苦难中度过的。上海解放不久，她才到国棉二厂工作。现在有吃有穿，儿子也上了学，解放前和解放后真是两样光景。这一次谈话后，白秀珍思想上斗争了好几天。
    这时，白秀珍同班的同志们为了帮助她进一步认识错误，也召开了小组会。大家用算细账办法帮助她认识不遵守劳动纪律对生产的影响，对国家的损害；有的同志还检讨了过去对白秀珍帮助不够耐心。白秀珍看到大家这样诚恳、严肃、耐心地帮助自己，又看到大家首先进行了自我批评，又感动又羞愧地说：“过去我光盼着国家富裕起来，让我们的生活过得更好，可是没想到，要是我们不好好生产，光盼是盼不到的。”她又说：“现在我知道大伙为我好，如果在旧社会，人家嫌你不好，早就把你赶出去了。我也知道同志审判委员会是为帮助我，并不是叫我坐‘监狱’。”她初步检讨了自己的错误。这天白秀珍又一天没吃饭，车间里助理员陈阿四帮她打饭，大家又去安慰她，使她感受到同志间的温暖。当天下班后，她没有马上回家，一个人在马路上徘徊，同组工人高桂芳又跑去安慰她，告诉她只要改正错误，将功折过，大家还会信任她的。第二天上午，白秀珍主动去找车间助理员陈阿四谈话，表示决心改过，并同意开同志审判大会，进一步教育她和教育大家。同志审判大会上根据她所犯错误和认识程度，决定建议行政领导上给她记大过一次的处分。
    审判会后，白秀珍的确变了，再不迟到早退破坏劳动纪律，坏纱不断减少，生产中遇到困难，就主动找组里工人研究解决，人也变得虚心了。大家为她的进步表示高兴。
