Xinhua News Agency, January 21st: Chemical industry factories under the Ministry of Heavy Industry produced many chemical fertilizers and pesticides for farmers last year. Last year, the sales bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry supplied chemical fertilizers to rural areas in East China, North China, and Northeast China through the supply and marketing cooperative system, which could be used as topdressing fertilizer for about 4 million mu of wheat or paddy fields. The processed 666 raw powder for supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions, if all made into 0.5% 666 powder, could be used to control locusts on approximately 115 million mu of farmland.

These chemical fertilizers and pesticides played a significant role in increasing crop yields and preventing insect pests. According to investigations by the Chemical Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry and related units, in some areas, applying 10 jin of chemical fertilizer per mu of land can increase wheat production by 40 to 60 jin, or increase millet production by 50 to 80 jin; applying 25 jin of chemical fertilizer per mu of cotton field can increase seed cotton production by more than 70 jin. In Kongzhong Guo Township, Yancheng County, Henan Province, the wheat seedlings grown on each mu of wheat field using 8 jin of chemical fertilizer were 2 to 3 cun taller than ordinary wheat seedlings, and the yield per mu increased by 50 jin. The Wang Futing mutual aid team in Dafu Village, Jin County, Liaoning Province, applied a large amount of ammonium sulfate to the fields last year, resulting in an average increase of more than 4 shi of sorghum per hectare compared to previous years, and an increase of 1,090 jin of cotton per hectare. The 666 insecticide, which can prevent more than 40 kinds of pests such as wheat thrips and cotton aphids, is also very popular among farmers in various regions. Farmers in Taoyuan District, Suxian County, Anhui Province, achieved 100% insecticidal efficiency by using 2.5 to 3.5 jin of 666 insecticide per mu. Farmers in Luoyang and Xuchang call 666 insecticide "One Sweep" and "Panacea".

The production of chemical fertilizers and pesticides by chemical industry factories under the Ministry of Heavy Industry has increased year by year. The chemical fertilizers produced by factories under the Chemical Industry Administration Bureau alone increased by 38% last year compared to 1953 and by 11 times compared to 1949; the production of 666 insecticide last year increased by more than doubled compared to 1953. This year's output will be greatly increased. Due to the efforts of the staff to reduce production costs, the allocation prices of chemical fertilizers and pesticides supplied by the sales bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry to supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions last year were also lower than in 1953.

    重工业部化学工业各厂
    去年为农民生产大量化学肥料和农药
    【新华社二十一日讯】重工业部所属化学工业各厂去年给农民生产了许多化学肥料和农药。重工业部销售局去年通过供销合作社系统供应华东、华北、东北等地农村的化学肥料，大约可以供四百多万亩麦田或稻田作追肥用。给各地供销合作社加工的六六六原粉，如果都制造成百分之零点五的粉剂六六六，大约可以供一亿一千五百多万亩农田用来除治蝗虫。
    这些化学肥料和农药对增加农作物的产量和防治虫害起了很大作用。据重工业部化学工业管理局和有关单位的调查，有些地区每亩田施用十斤化学肥料，就可以增产小麦四十斤到六十斤，或者可以增产谷子五十斤到八十斤；每亩棉田施用二十五斤化学肥料，可以增产籽棉七十多斤。河南省郾城县空塚郭乡每亩麦田用了八斤化学肥料，生长的麦苗比一般麦苗高出两寸到三寸，每亩田的产量增加了五十斤。辽宁省锦县大富村的王辅廷互助组，去年在田里施用了大量的硫酸铵，使每垧高粱的产量平均比往年增产四石多，每垧棉田多产了一千零九十斤棉花。可以防治小麦吸浆虫、棉蚜虫等四十多种害虫的六六六杀虫药剂，也很受各地农民欢迎。安徽宿县桃源区的农民，每亩用两斤半到三斤半六六六杀虫药剂，杀虫效率达到了百分之百。洛阳、许昌一带的农民都称六六六杀虫药剂是“一扫光”、“万灵药”。
    重工业部所属化学工业各厂生产的化学肥料和农药一年比一年多了。仅化学工业管理局所属的厂去年生产的化学肥料，就比一九五三年增加了百分之三十八，比一九四九年增加了十一倍；去年生产的六六六杀虫药剂比一九五三年增加了一倍多。各厂今年的产量还要大大增加。由于职工们努力降低生产成本，去年重工业部销售局供给各地供销合作社的化学肥料和农药的调拨价格，也比一九五三年降低了。
