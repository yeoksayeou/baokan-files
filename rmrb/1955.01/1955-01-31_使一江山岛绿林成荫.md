The pine seeds donated by the Young Pioneers of Huixing Girls' Middle School in Hangzhou to a certain unit of the Zhejiang Front troops have been planted on Yijiangshan Island.

Before the battle to liberate Yijiangshan Island, these precious seeds were distributed to the soldiers. During the battle to capture Yijiangshan Island, the soldiers never forgot to fulfill the beautiful wishes of the children. Some soldiers, even when wounded in battle, took out the seeds and handed them over to other comrades, asking them to take the seeds and continue to eliminate the enemy. After the battle on the 18th, the soldiers immediately began planting trees. By the 19th, the soldiers had buried all the seeds they brought with them in the soil of Yijiangshan Island. Yijiangshan Island, severely ravaged by the Chiang bandit troops, has no trees or flowers. The People's Liberation Army soldiers will plant a large number of trees and flowers to turn Yijiangshan Island into a verdant and shady garden.

    使一江山岛绿林成荫
    杭州市惠兴女中少先队员赠送给浙江前线部队某部的马尾松种籽，已经种在一江山岛。
    在发起解放一江山岛的战斗之前，这些珍贵的树种被分配到战士的手中。战士们在攻占一江山岛的战斗中，一刻也没有忘记实现孩子们的美丽心愿。有的战士在战斗中负伤了，还掏出树种交给其他同志，请他带着树种，继续消灭敌人。战士们在十八日战斗结束后，立即开始种树。十九日，战士们已把全部带去的树种埋在一江山岛的泥土中。遭受蒋贼军严重摧残的一江山岛，没有树木和花草，解放军战士们将大量种植树木和花草，使一江山岛变成绿林成荫的花园。
