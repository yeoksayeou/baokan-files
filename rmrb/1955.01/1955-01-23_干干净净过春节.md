Under the call of the Beijing Municipal Patriotic Health Movement Committee, the people of Beijing have generally carried out cleaning. Of the 158 households sampled by the Fuzhou Guanqian Street Residents' Committee in Xuanwu District, 152 had carried out thorough cleaning. Some households with many children used mutual aid to look after children so they could clean. Residents of all streets also universally washed all the family's clothes and bedding. Many areas, in conjunction with the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs, organized street activists to help families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs with cleaning. Baoan Temple in Xuanwu District organized eighty activists to help families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs with cleaning; and whitewashed ceilings and washed clothes and bedding for some families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs. Revolutionary soldier Guan Zhilu came to Beijing on official business and visited his family on the way. He said with emotion, "Everyone cares so much about our families, I will definitely tell the comrades in the army about this when I go back."

All organs, organizations, factories, schools, and other units in the capital have also carried out a major cleaning before the Spring Festival. (Zheng Youde)

    干干净净过春节
    北京市人民在爱国卫生运动委员会号召下，普遍进行了清洁扫除。宣武区福州馆前街居民委员会抽查的一百五十八户中，有一百五十二户都作了彻底的清扫。有些孩子多的住户，用互助看孩子的办法进行扫除。各街道居民并普遍拆洗了全家的衣服和被褥。很多地区结合拥军优属工作，组织街道积极分子帮助军属、烈属扫除。宣武区保安寺组织了八十个积极分子帮助军属、烈属扫除；并给某些军属糊了顶棚并拆洗了衣被。革命军人关志禄因公来京，顺便回家看望，感动地说：“大家这样关心我们的家属，我回去一定把这事讲给部队上的同志们听。”
    首都各机关、团体、工厂、学校等单位，也都在春节前进行了清洁大扫除。（郑幼德）
