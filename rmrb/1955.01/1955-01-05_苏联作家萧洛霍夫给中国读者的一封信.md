    Soviet Writer Sholokhov's Letter to Chinese Readers
    Dear Comrades, Chinese Friends!

    Many Chinese readers have requested that I discuss in the "People's Daily" the most prominent phenomena and problems during the collectivization period in the Soviet Union from 1929 to 1930, and also talk about the creative process of my works.

    Regarding this mass movement of the people, which Stalin considered to be of equal significance to the great October Revolution of 1917, it is impossible to describe it fully and in detail in a short article in a newspaper. Even in one or several novels, it is impossible to make such a description. Because everything in the movement of millions of people, just like the forces of nature, is magnificent and grand, and some fragments taken separately from this magnificent picture of life obviously cannot allow people to see the entire picture. Moreover, although the collectivization in various parts of the Soviet Union had its general characteristics, its course was different in different places, which also limited the possibility of making such a description. Approximately the same situation also occurs in China. I cannot imagine that in the People's Republic of China, the process of transitioning to a collective economy would be the same in those areas that were already base areas of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and those areas that were liberated later from the oppression of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits.

    As for my writing method, in principle, it is no different from the working methods of any Soviet writer. Of course, each of us solves creative tasks in different ways, but our goal is the same: to serve the great cause of communism; we also arm ourselves with the same things: eyes, heart, and a great love for the working people, and our mission is to serve them with our art.

    Regarding myself, I can only briefly talk about the following: I am writing the ending part of the second, and also the last, volume of "Virgin Soil Upturned." This volume narrates the period of the complete completion of collectivization in the Don River Basin and the destinies of the heroes who grew up through various experiences.

    After finishing "Virgin Soil Upturned," I will continue to write the novel "They Fought for Their Country." This novel will be a trilogy. Its first part is almost finished, but a lot of time is still needed for the final polishing and to complete this work as a whole.

    If I speak frankly, dear friends, I should explain to you with a little melancholy that I am somewhat lagging behind the speed of our rapidly developing life: during the anti-fascist war years, Soviet soldiers had already raised the victory flag on the German Reichstag, but I failed to complete the first part of the novel "They Fought for Their Country"; when I finished about two hundred pages of "Virgin Soil Upturned," in this time, 17.5 million hectares of virgin land had been reclaimed in the Soviet Union.

    The only thing that can comfort me is that we Soviets, millions of people fought for their country, and thousands upon thousands of people went to reclaim virgin land, while I had to engage in the writing of my novel alone. But this is only a small comfort, and I will have to put in a lot of effort to catch up with my readers and move forward with them.

    Finally, I would like to sincerely say to you: We love you firmly, warmly watch your heroic achievements on the labor front, rejoice in these achievements, and embrace you in our hearts.

    I wish the great Chinese people new labor achievements and happiness in life in the coming new year, and I wish my colleagues new creative achievements and bold endeavors in writing.
      Mikhail Sholokhov

### 苏联作家萧洛霍夫给中国读者的一封信

    苏联作家萧洛霍夫给中国读者的一封信亲爱的同志们，中国朋友们！
    许多中国读者要求我在“人民日报”上讲一讲一九二九年到一九三○年间苏联实行集体化时的最突出的现象和问题，同时也讲一讲我的作品的创作过程。
    关于这一广大人民群众的运动，斯大林曾把它看做和一九一七年伟大的十月革命具有同等意义的运动，在报纸上的一篇短文里，要多少完全和详细地加以叙述，是不可能的。即使在一部甚至几部长篇小说里，要做这样的叙述，也是不可能的。因为千百万人民群众的运动中的一切，正如自然界的力量一样，是壮丽雄伟的，从这一雄伟的生活图卷中单独撷取下来的一些断片，显然是不能使人看到整个画面的。况且，苏联各地的集体化虽有它的一般特征，但它的经过却各不相同，这一点也限制了做这样的叙述的可能。大约同样的情形也发生在中国。我不能设想在中华人民共和国，那些早就是中国人民解放军的根据地的地区同那些从蒋匪帮压迫下解放得较晚的地区，向集体经济过渡的过程会是一样的。
    至于说到我的写作的创作方法，那末，在原则上它是和任何苏联作家的工作方法没有什么区别的。当然，我们每个人都按照不同方式来解决创作任务，但我们的目标却只有一个：为伟大的共产主义事业服务；我们用以武装自己的东西也是同样的：眼睛、心灵和对于劳动人民的巨大的爱，我们的使命就是用自己的艺术来为他们服务。
    关于我自己，我只能简单地谈谈下面一点：我正在写作“被开垦的处女地”第二卷、也是最后一卷的结束部分。这一卷所叙述的是：顿河流域集体化的彻底完成时期，通过各种不同的经历成长起来的英雄们的命运。
    写完“被开垦的处女地”之后，我将继续写作长篇小说“他们为祖国而战”。这部长篇小说将是一部三部曲。它的第一部已经快要写完了，但为了最后的润色和整个地完成这一工作，还需要很多时间。
    如果直率地说，亲爱的朋友们，我应该带一点忧郁地向你们说明，我是有些落后于我们突飞猛进的生活的速度了：在反法西斯战争年代，苏联战士已经在德国国会大厦上竖起了胜利的旗帜，而我却未能完成长篇小说“他们为祖国而战”的第一部；当我写完了“被开垦的处女地”的二百来页的时候，在这时间里，在苏联却已开垦了一千七百五十万公顷的处女地。
    唯一能够使我自慰的是，我们苏联人，有千百万人曾为祖国而战，有成千累万的人曾去开垦处女地，而我却不得不只是一个人来从事我的小说的写作。但是，这也只是很小的自慰，为了赶上我的读者们，并和他们齐步前进，我还将付出不少的努力。
    最后，我想由衷地对你们说：我们牢牢地爱着你们，热情地注视着你们在劳动战线上的英雄业绩，为这些成就欢欣鼓舞，并在心里拥抱你们。
    祝伟大的中国人民在即将到来的新的一年里获得新的劳动成就和生活的幸福，祝我的同行们在写作上有新的创造性的成就和大胆的企图。
      米·萧洛霍夫
