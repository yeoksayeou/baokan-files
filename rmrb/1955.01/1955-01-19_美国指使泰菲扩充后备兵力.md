Xinhua News Agency, January 17th: The United States is directing Thailand and the Philippines to accelerate the expansion of armed forces of a reserve nature. In Thailand, this army is called the "Volunteer Corps." In the Philippines, this army is scheduled to be called the "Citizen Army." Tens of thousands of young people will be incorporated into this force to receive training in the use of American weapons.

　　Bangkok newspapers recently quoted sources close to the government as saying that the Thai Ministry of Interior has decided to expand the "Volunteer Corps" to 20,000 people in 1955. The news also said that in the estimated figure of the "economic assistance" given by the United States to Thailand, there is an appropriation of 3 million US dollars, which is scheduled to be used for the construction of barracks and the purchase of clothing and training equipment for the so-called "Volunteer Corps."

　　According to the "Manila Times" report in early this month, the Philippine military authorities and personnel of the United States Joint Military Advisory Group in the Philippines decided at a secret meeting held on the 4th to immediately start large-scale training of reserve soldiers in order to establish a "Citizen Army." The Philippine military authorities are prepared to implement large-scale military training for young people who have reached the age of twenty.

    美国指使泰菲扩充后备兵力
   【新华社十七日讯】美国正在指使泰国和菲律宾加紧扩建后备队性质的武装力量。在泰国，这种军队叫作“志愿队”。在菲律宾，这种军队预定叫作“公民军”。数以万计的青年将要被编进这种队伍里去接受使用美式武器的训练。
    曼谷报纸最近引述接近政府方面的消息说，泰国内政部已经决定在一九五五年把“志愿队”扩充到二万人。消息并说，在美国给泰国的“经济援助”的预计数字中，有一笔三百万美元的拨款，是预定用来给所谓“志愿队”建筑营房以及购置服装和训练器材的。
    据“马尼拉时报”本月上旬报道，菲律宾军事当局和美国驻菲律宾联合军事顾问团人员已经在四日举行的一次秘密会议上，决定了立即开始大规模训练后备士兵的工作，以便建立一支“公民军”。菲律宾军事当局已经准备对年满二十岁的青年实施大规模军事训练。
