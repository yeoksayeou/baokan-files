    Hefei Builds New Feather Processing Factory
    A new feather processing factory has been established in Hefei City, Anhui Province. The main task of this factory is to sort duck and goose feathers, separating out those that meet export specifications.
    The Anhui region previously had no feather processing factories. Feathers purchased from various parts of the province had to be transported to other places for processing, greatly increasing the cost of the feathers (transportation costs accounted for half of the total cost). The Anhui Provincial Company of the China National Native Produce and Animal By-products Import & Export Corporation organized more than 700 unemployed women and some disaster victims in Hefei City to establish this feather processing factory. In the past fifty days, this factory has already processed 530,000 catties of feathers. These processed feathers only need to have their packaging changed when transported to Shanghai and can then be directly exported.

    合肥新建羽毛加工厂
    安徽省合肥市已新建立了一个羽毛加工整理厂。这个厂的主要工作是挑拣鸭毛、鹅毛，分出合乎出口规格的羽毛。
    安徽地区过去没有羽毛加工厂，从省内各地收购的羽毛要运往外地加工，羽毛成本因此大大增加（其中运费要占全部成本的一半）。中国畜产公司安徽省公司组织了合肥市的失业女工和一部分灾民共七百多人，建立了这个羽毛加工整理厂。在过去的五十天当中，这个厂已经加工了五十三万斤羽毛。这些经过整理的羽毛，运到上海只要改换一下包皮，就可以直接出口。
