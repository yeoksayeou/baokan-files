    Ministry of Agriculture Convenes National Conference on State Farms
    Defines Development Direction for the Next Three Years and Production Tasks for This Year
    The Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China convened the National Conference on State Farms from December 11th to 29th of last year. Based on the state farm construction policy of "small investment, quick results, large harvests, and not competing with the people for land," and the basic tasks of state farms to increase grain production for the country, accumulate funds, accumulate experience, train cadres, and demonstrate to farmers, the conference summarized the work of national state-owned mechanized farms this year, fully exchanged experiences in management, and studied and determined the direction for the next three years, specifically stipulating the production tasks for 1955.
    Currently, there are 101 state-owned mechanized farms nationwide (the current number after mergers), of which 43 were newly built or rebuilt last year. According to preliminary statistics, the cultivated area of these 101 farms totals more than 2.8 million mu, and they produced more than 360 million jin of grain for the country last year. Most farms have achieved increased yields and reduced costs. The average yield per unit area of ​​major crops such as wheat, rice, soybeans, and cotton has exceeded that of farmers. The grain yield per unit area increased by 25 percent compared to the previous year.
    Last year, the management level of various mechanized farms has improved to varying degrees. Preliminary quota management was implemented, non-production personnel were reduced, and improvements were made in seed, fertilizer, and mechanical technology. Some farms have developed diversified agricultural economies. However, many problems still exist in the work. The main problems are that production is very unbalanced between farms, there is still blindness in the development of new farms, and the guiding principles of operation and production technology have not yet fully adapted to regional characteristics. After analyzing these shortcomings, the conference pointed out that in the future, all mechanized farms must rely on employees to run the farms well, fully and effectively utilize land, improve the utilization rate of existing machinery and equipment, and improve labor productivity and mechanical and agricultural technology; develop multi-sector agricultural economy, combine agricultural development with animal husbandry, forestry, and fishery according to the conditions of the farm, as well as crop rotation; we must be careful in calculation, practice strict economy, and fully implement the economic accounting system. The conference also put forward different requirements for various types of farms.
    The conference determined that the development direction of state-owned mechanized farms from 1955 to 1957 is: consolidate and improve old farms, develop new farms in a planned way, and actively prepare for large-scale reclamation for the Second Five-Year Plan. In 1955, the national state-owned mechanized farms are required to have a cultivated area of 4 million to 4.3 million mu, a sown area of 3 million mu, a grain production of 620 million jin, a ginned cotton production of 3.6 million jin, and 40,000 pigs raised.

    农业部召开全国国营农场工作会议
    确定今后三年发展的方针和今年生产任务
    中华人民共和国农业部在去年十二月十一日到二十九日间召开了全国国营农场工作会议。会议根据“投资少、收效快、收获大、不与民争地”的建场方针和为国家增产粮食、积累资金、积累经验、培养干部和示范农民等项国营农场基本任务对今年全国国营机械农场工作作了总结，充分交流了经营管理方面的经验，并研究确定了今后三年的方针，具体规定了一九五五年的生产任务。
    目前全国已有国营机械农场一百零一个（合并后现有数），其中去年新建和改建的有四十三个。据初步统计，这一百零一个农场耕地面积共达二百八十多万亩，去年为国家生产粮食三亿六千多万斤。多数农场做到了提高产量、降低成本。主要作物小麦、水稻、大豆和棉花等的平均单位面积产量都超过农民的产量。粮食的单位面积产量比前年提高百分之二十五。
    去年各机械农场的经营管理水平都有不同程度的提高，初步实行了定额管理，减少了非生产人员，处理种籽、肥料和机务技术等方面也都有改进。有的农场发展了多种农业经济。但工作中仍存在很多问题，主要问题是场与场间生产很不平衡，在发展新场中仍存在盲目性，在经营方针和生产技术上还未能完全适应地域性的特点。会议在分析这些缺点之后，指出今后各机械农场要依靠职工办好农场，充分有效地利用土地、提高现有机器设备利用率，提高劳动生产率和机务技术、农业技术；发展多部门农业经济，根据本场条件结合农业发展畜牧、林业、渔业等及农作物的换槎轮作；要精打细算，厉行节约，全面贯彻经济核算制。会议并对各种不同类型的农场提出了不同的要求。
    会议确定一九五五年到一九五七年国营机械农场发展的方针是：巩固提高老场，有计划地发展新场，积极为第二个五年计划大量垦荒做好准备。一九五五年要求全国国营机械农场耕地面积达到四百到四百三十万亩，播种面积三百万亩，生产粮食六亿二千万斤，皮棉三百六十万斤，养猪四万头。　（新华社）
