    The grain departments of Heilongjiang Province are transferring large quantities of grain from the newly collected and state-purchased grain to support the people in disaster areas within the passes (关内). As of early January, in addition to transporting over 900 million jin of grain to Shenyang, Fushun, Lushun-Dalian, Yichun, and other places, they have transported over 520 million jin of grain to disaster-stricken areas in Hebei, Anhui, Hubei, Jiangsu, and other provinces. This grain has alleviated the living difficulties of many people in disaster areas.
    In January, Heilongjiang Province planned to transport grain to disaster areas within the passes, and 60.3% of the plan had already been completed by the 10th. It is expected that the monthly transfer plan can be completed ahead of schedule before the Spring Festival. (Jing Chunling, Guo Jinglin)

    陆续调粮支援灾区
    黑龙江省粮食部门从征收和统购的新粮中，调运出大批粮食支援关内灾区人民。到一月上旬，他们除运往沈阳、抚顺、旅大、伊春等地九亿多斤粮食外，运往河北、安徽、湖北、江苏等省受灾地区的粮食，有五亿二千多万斤。这些粮食解决了不少灾区人民的生活困难。
    一月份黑龙江省计划运往关内灾区的粮食，到十日已经运出百分之六十点三；预计春节前可以提 前完成全月调运计划。　（景纯灵、郭景临）
