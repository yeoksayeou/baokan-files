Xinhua News Agency, January 17th: TASS, New York, January 16th: According to reports from San José, on January 15th, Costa Rican government forces engaged invading troops in a three-hour battle near the city of Santa Rosa, according to a statement from the Costa Rican Armed Forces Command. The Command's communique stated that government forces strongly defended the city and drove the thugs out of Santa Rosa.

According to reports from Washington, the Costa Rican Embassy in the United States released a message on January 15th stating that several "aircraft of unknown nationality" attacked the Costa Rican city of Liberia. A large fire broke out in the city. There were casualties among the residents.

Xinhua News Agency, January 17th: TASS, New York, January 16th: According to a United Press International correspondent in Washington, the Organization of American States (OAS) Council limited itself to passing a resolution condemning interference in Costa Rica's internal affairs. The resolution merely "calls upon the governments of the Americas, particularly the government of Nicaragua, not to permit the use of their territories" to violate Costa Rica. The report submitted to the Council by the committee sent by the OAS Council to Costa Rica acknowledged that the incursions suffered by Costa Rica originated from Nicaragua and that Costa Rica's territorial integrity, sovereignty, and political independence were under threat.

The Associated Press reported that the commander of the interventionist army is Little Picado, the son of the former President of Costa Rica and a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point.

    哥斯达黎加政府军继续对入侵部队作战
    美洲国家组织理事会只通过一项谴责干涉内政的空洞决议
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社纽约十六日讯：据圣约瑟消息，根据哥斯达黎加武装部队司令部的声明，一月十五日，哥斯达黎加政府军同入侵部队在圣罗萨城附近进行了三小时战斗。司令部的公报说，政府军坚强地保住了这个城市，并且把暴徒驱赶出圣罗萨城。
    据华盛顿消息，哥斯达黎加驻美国大使馆在一月十五日发布消息说，几架“国籍不明的飞机”袭击了哥斯达黎加的利贝里雅城。城内发生了大火。居民有伤亡。
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社纽约十六日讯：据合众社驻华盛顿记者报道，美洲国家组织理事会只限于通过一项决议，谴责对哥斯达黎加内政的干涉。这项决议仅仅“呼吁美洲各国政府，特别是尼加拉瓜政府，不要允许利用它们的领土”侵犯哥斯达黎加。（美洲国家组织理事会）派往哥斯达黎加的委员会提交理事会的报告承认，哥斯达黎加所受到的侵扰是从尼加拉瓜方面来的，哥斯达黎加的领土完整、主权和政治独立已经处在威胁之中。
    美联社报道说，干涉军的指挥是哥斯达黎加前总统的儿子、美国西点军校的毕业生小皮卡多。
