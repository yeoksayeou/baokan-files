    Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Front, 15th. For the past several days, the People's Liberation Army Air Force units on the Zhejiang front have been repelling Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes that have been bombing and harassing our Zhejiang East Coast at night.
    From the night of the 11th to dawn on the 15th, Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes dispatched 14 batches totaling 17 sorties, attempting to sneak into Nanjiushan, Tian’ao Island, Toumenshan, and Jigushan Island off the coast of eastern Zhejiang to carry out bombing raids. However, under the interception and pursuit of our night-flying aircraft groups, some of these Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes blindly dropped their bombs and quickly fled, while others dropped their bombs into the sea halfway and turned around to escape. At 18:59 on the 11th, a Chiang Kai-shek PB-4Y aircraft flew to the sky five kilometers southwest of Nanjiushan. Upon discovering our night-flying aircraft group, it quickly fled in a southeast direction. At 1:23 on the 13th, a Chiang Kai-shek PB-4Y aircraft, under the interception of our night-flying aircraft group, dropped its bombs in the sea south of Toumenshan and fled south.

    我空军连日击退骚扰浙东沿海的蒋贼飞机
    【新华社浙江前线十五日电】浙江前线中国人民解放军空军部队，最近连日击退在夜间向我浙东沿海进行轰炸、骚扰的蒋贼飞机。
    自十一日夜间到十五日拂晓，蒋贼飞机先后出动十四批十七架次，企图窜入我浙东沿海南韭山、田岙岛、头门山和积谷山岛等地进行轰炸。但在我军夜航机群的迎击和追击下，这些蒋贼飞机有的盲目地扔下炸弹赶紧飞走，有的在半途就把炸弹投在海中调头逃窜。十一日十八时五十九分，蒋贼PB四Y型飞机一架，飞到南韭山西南五公里上空，发现我夜航机群后，就赶紧向东南方向逃走。十三日一时二十三分，蒋贼PB四Y型飞机一架在我夜航机群的迎击下，把炸弹扔在头门山以南的海中就向南飞逃。
