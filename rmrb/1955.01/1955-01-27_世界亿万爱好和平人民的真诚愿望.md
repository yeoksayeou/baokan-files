    The Sincere Wish of Hundreds of Millions of Peace-Loving People in the World
    Zhou Peiyuan, Chairman of the Council of the Chinese Physical Society
    The Soviet Union's Council of Ministers' decision to openly share the method of peaceful utilization of atomic energy, a great discovery of mankind, with other countries, and its suggestion to our country, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and East Germany to provide extensive assistance in science, technology, and industry to establish scientific experimental centers to develop research on nuclear physics and the peaceful uses of atomic energy is a great initiative unprecedented in human history. It opens a new era in the history of scientific development and in the cultural exchange relations between countries. The great Soviet Union's decision to unconditionally give the creative labor results of advanced Soviet scientists and technicians to fraternal countries is based on a cooperative foundation of mutual assistance and a sincere desire to achieve common economic prosperity. It is a further measure to implement a peace diplomacy policy that shines brightly across the world.
    When the blood of the martyrs who sacrificed in the anti-fascist war had not yet dried, and the memories of the war disasters suffered by hundreds of millions of people were still fresh, the heinous American imperialists used the temporarily monopolized atomic weapons to intimidate the people of the world and carry out atomic blackmail, attempting to realize their sinister conspiracy to control the world. The great Soviet Union, which has always advocated peace and upheld justice, has resolutely opposed atomic and all other weapons of mass destruction from that time and has consistently called for atomic energy to be used for the benefit of mankind. This historic statement of our great ally gives a severe blow to the American aggressive clique, which has recently intensified its atomic war clamor, and once again eloquently demonstrates the sincerity and determination of the Soviet Union to defend world peace, thereby strengthening the world people's belief that peace will surely defeat war, isolating American imperialism, and expanding and consolidating the foundation of the world peace and democracy camp. Our people and the peace-loving people of the world welcome the great Soviet Union's epoch-making statement with joy and excitement, and express our heartfelt thanks and high respect to the government and people of our great ally.
    The fact that mankind can use the infinite treasures of atomic energy in nature to serve peaceful construction is a brilliant achievement obtained by physicists, mechanics, mathematicians, chemists, engineers, and technicians through long-term creative labor and the exertion of highly collective strength. The fission of the atomic nucleus is one of the most fundamental discoveries of the properties of matter in the history of physics development. Mastering the chain reaction of atomic nuclear fission and making it a violent explosion, thereby generating a large amount of energy in a very short interval of time, requires solving highly scientific and technical problems. Furthermore, controlling the violent atomic nuclear chain reaction and making it obediently serve peaceful construction cannot succeed without solving a series of more complex scientific and technical problems. The excellent Soviet scientific workers, since discovering the method of producing atomic energy in 1947, have been able to invent an atomic energy generator for peaceful construction in just seven years, undoubtedly confirming that Soviet science ranks first in the world and has definitely surpassed the science of capitalist countries. The fact that the Soviet Union can supply our country and other fraternal countries with a certain number of atomic piles and fissile materials for scientific research clearly shows that the supply of atomic piles and the fissile materials produced in the Soviet Union has reached a quantity that can help other countries. This is something the United States cannot catch up with.
    It must be pointed out that the reason why Soviet science has been able to make such amazing progress is because it has been guided by the invincible ideology of Marxism-Leninism. Under the superior socialist political system, scientists can exert an incomparably powerful collective force, ensuring that the scientific achievements obtained through creative labor are used to develop social productive forces and promote social progress. The infinite concern of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union for scientific undertakings also encourages Soviet scientists and technicians to wholeheartedly contribute their wisdom and strength to the happiness of mankind. The excellent Soviet scientific workers are the model for our scientific workers to learn from; the advanced Soviet science is the goal for our scientific workers to strive for. Inspired by the great Soviet friendship, our scientific and technological workers must follow Chairman Mao's instructions and learn Marxism-Leninism and the brilliant achievements of the Soviet Union in science and technology more humbly, more deeply, and more comprehensively.
    The Soviet Union's selfless assistance to our country in the peaceful uses of nuclear physics and atomic energy will vigorously promote the development of physics and related sciences and technologies in our country and accelerate the realization of the application of atomic energy. Our vast motherland urgently needs the peaceful use of atomic energy. The utilization of atomic energy can solve the energy problems in areas lacking prime movers. Automobiles equipped with atomic engines can shorten transportation time on the Kangzang and Qingzang highways; airplanes powered by atomic energy can take off from Beijing and reach Moscow without stopping in between. Atomic energy can be used to open mountains, build roads, transform deserts into fertile fields, and establish modern cities in desolate areas. Atomic energy will raise new scientific research questions for many sciences and engineering fields, thereby expanding the scope of various sciences and promoting the development of science and technology to a higher level. In short, the peaceful utilization of atomic energy will accelerate the development of the motherland's productive forces and bring us an infinitely beautiful future.
    However, the American imperialists are not reconciled to seeing us carry out our peaceful construction undertakings. It colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to sign the US-Chiang aggression treaty, attempting to occupy our territory Taiwan for a long time and find a legal basis for invading the Chinese mainland; in Western Europe, it coerced its vassal states to sign the Paris Agreement, using atomic and hydrogen weapons to arm the revived German militarists, vainly attempting to legalize atomic warfare. Opposing war, advocating the use of atomic energy for peaceful construction, and advocating the destruction of atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs are the sincere wishes of hundreds of millions of peace-loving people around the world. The Soviet Union's epoch-making statement on openly utilizing atomic energy for peaceful purposes has added new strength to our sacred cause of defending world peace. We resolutely support all measures taken by our great ally, the Soviet Union, to oppose war and defend peace. We must heighten our vigilance, support the liberation of Taiwan with our practical actions, and fight to the end to chop off the atomic aggressive claws of American imperialism.

    世界亿万爱好和平人民的真诚愿望
    中国物理学会理事会理事长　周培源
    苏联部长会议决定以人类伟大的发现——原子能的和平利用方法公开给其他国家，并已向我国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚和民主德国建议，提供在科学、技术和工业上的广泛帮助，来建立科学实验中心以发展对核子物理学和原子能的和平用途方面的研究。这是人类史无前例的伟大创举，在科学发展史上和在各国人民之间的文化交流关系上开一新纪元。伟大的苏联决定把先进的苏联科学家和技术人员的创造性劳动成果，毫无保留地送给兄弟国家，是根据相互帮助和求得共同的经济高涨的真诚愿望的合作基础，是执行光芒普照全世界的和平外交政策的进一步的措施。
    当在反法西斯战争中牺牲了的烈士们的鲜血尚未干，亿万人民饱受战争灾难的记忆犹新的时候，万恶的美帝国主义者就以垄断一时的原子武器恫吓世界人民、进行原子讹诈，企图实现控制全世界的罪恶阴谋。一向主张和平、坚持正义的伟大的苏联从那时起即坚决地反对原子及其他一切大规模毁灭性武器，始终不渝地呼吁原子能必须为人类谋福利。我们伟大的盟邦这一项历史性的声明给予最近加紧原子战争叫嚣的美国侵略集团一个严重的打击，并又一次雄辩地说明了苏联保卫世界和平的诚意和决心，因而加强了世界人民对和平必定会战胜战争的信念，孤立了美帝国主义，扩大了并巩固了世界和平民主阵营的基础。我们全国人民和世界爱好和平的人民在一道，用欢欣鼓舞的心情来迎接伟大的苏联划时代的声明，并向我们伟大盟邦政府和人民表示衷心的感谢和崇高的敬意。
    人类能使自然界无限宝藏的原子能为和平建设服务，是物理学家、力学家、数学家、化学家、工程师和技术人员经过了长期的创造性劳动，并发挥了高度的集体力量所获得的光辉成果。原子核的分裂作用，是在物理学发展史上物质属性的最基本发现之一。掌握原子核分裂作用的链式反应，并使它作暴烈性的爆炸，从而在一极短的时间间隔内产生大量的能量，需要解决高度科学性和技术性的问题。而进一步控制暴烈性的原子核链式反应，并使它驯服地为和平建设服务，则非解决一系列更复杂的科学和技术性的问题不能成功。优秀的苏联科学工作者自一九四七年发现了生产原子能的方法起，能在短短的七年内发明了服务于和平建设的原子能发电机，毫无疑问地证实了苏联科学已居世界第一位，并已肯定地超过了资本主义国家的科学。苏联能供给我国和其他兄弟国家若干数量的原子堆和科学研究用的可分裂物质，这很显然地说明了在苏联的原子堆和所产生的可分裂物质的供应上，已达到可帮助其他国家的数量。这是美国所赶不上的。
    必须指出，苏联科学之所以能够有此惊人的发展，是由于有战无不胜的马克思列宁主义的思想指导，在优越的社会主义政治制度下科学家可以发挥无比强大的集体力量，使由创造性劳动得来的科学成果保证用来发展社会生产力，推动社会前进。苏联共产党对科学事业的无限关怀，也鼓舞着苏联科学家和技术人员全心全意地贡献出他们的智慧和力量为人类谋幸福。苏联的优秀科学工作者是我们科学工作者学习的模范；苏联的先进科学是我们科学工作者的奋斗目标。在伟大的苏联友谊鼓舞下，我们科学和技术工作者必须遵循毛主席的指示，更虚心地、更深入地、更全面地学习马克思列宁主义和苏联在科学和技术上的辉煌成就。
    苏联对我国在核子物理学和原子能的和平用途方面的无私帮助，将有力地推动我国物理学和有关科学与技术的发展、加速应用原子能的实现。我们幅员辽阔的祖国对原子能的和平利用是有迫切需要的。原子能的被利用可解决缺乏原动力地区的能源问题。装配了原子能发动机的汽车可缩短康藏和青藏公路上的运输时间；用原子能作原动力的飞机可自北京起飞到达莫斯科在中途无需停留。原子能可用来开山、辟路、化沙漠为良田，在荒凉地区建立现代的都市。原子能将对许多门科学和工程学提出新的科学研究问题，从而扩大各门科学的范围，推动科学和技术发展到更高的水平。总之，原子能的和平利用将加速祖国生产力的发展，给我们带来无限美好的未来。
    但是，美帝国主义者是不甘心看到我们进行和平建设事业的。他勾结蒋介石卖国集团签订美蒋侵略条约，企图长期侵占我国领土台湾并为侵略中国大陆找法律根据；在西欧则胁迫他的仆从国家签订巴黎协定，以原子武器和氢武器来武装复活的德国军国主义者，妄想使原子战争合法化。反对战争、主张将原子能用于和平建设并主张销毁原子弹和氢弹，是全世界亿万爱好和平的人民的真诚愿望。苏联关于公开和平利用原子能的划时代声明，在我们保卫世界和平的神圣事业中增加了新的力量。我们坚决拥护我们伟大的盟邦苏联反对战争、保卫和平的一切措施。我们必须提高警惕，以我们的实际行动支援台湾的解放，并为斩断美帝国主义的原子侵略魔手而奋斗到底。
