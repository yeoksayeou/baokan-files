	The Romanian film "The Ideal is Realized" describes the fate of an ordinary Romanian farmer, Mitri Kokor. This farmer's childhood and youth were spent in hardship: he was tortured in the landlord's family, he lived an inhuman life in the reactionary army, and he was sent to the battlefield in the war of aggression... But these hardships did not overwhelm him. In the darkness of the countryside and the storms of war, Mitri was tempered and found the truth.

	The scenes depicting Mitri's suffering are pictures exposing the old society where people eat people and people oppress people. The scene where Mitri was severely beaten by the police is an example. Why was he beaten? Simply because he expressed a little dissatisfaction with his master, the landlord Clisga, in front of his brother, and his brother, who had already degenerated into a lackey of the landlord, secretly reported his dissatisfaction to the landlord, who then used the police to beat him. In this scene, the characters of each person are vividly portrayed, and at the same time, it powerfully exposes the old society. For the helpless Mitri, the old society was like an extremely carefully arranged trap. As soon as you expressed a little dissatisfaction, you immediately suffered severe persecution. The scenes of Mitri's life in the reactionary army also left a deep impression on people: the endless, tormenting physical and spiritual drills, the arrogant and extremely foolish lectures of the officers. There, almost every soldier could be treated as a thief. The officers shouted loudly at them, "Are there any thieves among you?"... In such an army, human status and dignity were completely erased!

	The film focuses on depicting Mitri's growth process, and how he gradually increased his understanding in a life of suffering. The film's depiction of Mitri's innocent and pure inner world, and his unyielding spirit towards the oppressors, is particularly moving. When he used a dung fork to resist Lengu, his brother, who was chasing him fiercely, it was the first time he expressed an attitude of resistance to life. After the sudden death of his parents, he originally hoped to get sympathy from his own brother, but what he got was completely different - his brother wanted to drive him out of the house. Why is life so cruel? From his young and ignorant eyes, we saw Mitri questioning life for the first time; but later, after he had been a long-term worker for several years, after suffering a lot of torment, when he was severely beaten by the police and rushed out of the police station, and then encountered the smiling face of the landlord Clisga, Mitri had a further understanding of the landlord's tricks and ruthlessness. He angrily threw the money given to him by the landlord's wife on the ground and stepped on it. We saw the peasant's hatred for the landlord in him.

	Harsh life educated and tempered Mitri in this way, so that when he received the leadership of the Party, when he met "people fighting for the rights of the poor" in the barracks, when he saw the happy life of the Soviet people with his own eyes during his captivity in the Soviet Union, he quickly became a strong fighter for the interests of the people.

	In Mitri, we saw the strong perseverance of Romanian farmers, and we saw their firm spirit of pursuing the truth. Despite the many difficulties, despite the wind and rain, Mitri, like a strong sapling, grew upwards firmly and stubbornly.

	Another person the film focuses on depicting is Mitri's brother, Lengu. Although he was not rich at first, as a mill owner and later as the village chief, he had completely become an appendage and lackey of the landlord class. Through his conversation with the landlord Clisga when he secretly reported his brother's dissatisfaction, the film incisively portrays his character. He first said, "I thought for a long time before I dared to see you, my wife told me to come." Then he said, "It's hard to say, it's my brother's business, I pity him." After pretending for a long time, he said his purpose, "He's very powerful... I can't hit him, let someone else hit him." What a foolish, shameless and greedy character. In order to occupy a small piece of his brother's land, in order to gain the favor of the landlord class, he had completely lost his conscience. As a decadent and declining class force and a newborn force pursuing the happiness of the people, how strong is the contrast between the two brothers!

	Mitri, the new generation of Romanian farmers, entered society with a simple and kind heart, found the truth of life and saw the direction of a new life under the education of reality and the Party. Here, while depicting the road of our protagonist, the film also expresses another important theme, that is, the friendship of the ordinary Romanian people towards the Soviet Union, and the hatred of the ruling class towards the Soviet Union. These two attitudes have almost become a thread running through the entire story.

	In Lengu's words, Mitri heard the landlord class's hostility towards Chainatz - a farmer with progressive ideas; however, at Uncle Chainatz's, the young Mitri saw for the first time a book entitled "The Soviet Union Today" and heard that there was such a country in the world without the landlord Clisga and the mill owner.

	When the Romanian reactionary government followed Hitler and was about to participate in the war of aggression against the Soviet Union, we heard the young people in the village singing sad songs full of anger at the rulers. But the landlord and Lengu were calculating the prices of grain, wool and other materials, calculating that they would make huge profits in the war.

	In the barracks, Mitri's teacher explained to him why the poor are always so miserable, why the landlord class supports this war, why their generals are shouting to participate in the "most sacred" war, and shouting "Long live the Führer Hitler."

	At this time, Mitri was no longer a young and ignorant child, he already understood more. When he was about to be sent to the Soviet battlefield, his lover Natasha said to him: "...The people in the village are all crying, watching them all leave. Why send us to foreign countries? We who live by our labor don't need war. We have nothing to fight for." Mitri's answer was: "You're right, we have nothing to fight with those people in the East. We have to fight here!"

	At this time, Mitri had already begun to have firm goals and clear will. He already knew who were the real friends and who were the real enemies, and he already understood what he wanted to build his new life into. "We have to fight here!" That is to say, we should not invade others, we should build a happy life on our own land, and eliminate all the enemies on our own land - this is the voice of millions of people.

	Let the warmongers also listen to such voices. Since the Soviet Union appeared on the earth, the bourgeois careerists have dreamed of eliminating the Soviet Union and shouting to march east. Even today, there are still some unscrupulous people who are making such plans. They have not learned from historical experience. They have not realized how arrogant it is that they are still making such wishful thinking today! They have forgotten a fact, that is, the people have awakened, and millions of Mitris have awakened. They have come from the painful life experience. The price paid by the bourgeois governments of some European countries for betraying the people and supporting the fascist war was so heavy. Just in Romania, as a result of directly participating in the war, the Romanian people sacrificed more than 500,000 people. The significance of the several scenes of the war reproduced in the film is profound. Today, the people of Romania have begun to control their own destiny. They are resolutely building a life like the Soviet Union, and have joined the great socialist camp as a member of the new commando team. The strength of this unity and friendship is forever invincible.

	I think that this is precisely the important theme of the film "The Ideal is Realized", and it is also an important reason why people warmly welcome the original work of this film [Note], and why the 7th International Film Festival awarded this film the "Struggle for Social Progress Award". People here see the road they have traveled, and they see their own desire and firm confidence in a peaceful life.
	
	[Note] The original work of the film "The Ideal is Realized", "Mitri Kokor" has been published more than one million copies in Romania, and has been translated into more than ten languages. Its author, Mihail Sadoveanu, is an outstanding Romanian political activist, a great writer, and has won the Gold Medal of the World Peace Council in 1950 for this reason.

    看罗马尼亚影片“理想实现了”
    唐漠
    编剧：根据密哈伊尔·萨托维亚努所著小说改编
    导演：玛·萨托瓦维·伊里乌　罗马尼亚布加勒斯特电影制片厂出品
    翻译：尹广文　配音导演：白景晟　东北电影制片厂配音复制
    罗马尼亚影片“理想实现了”所描述的是罗马尼亚一个普通的农民米特里·柯可尔的命运。这个农民的少年和青年时代都是在苦难中度过的：他在地主家庭中的受折磨，他在反动军队里的非人生活，他在侵略战争中又被送往战场……；但是这些苦难并没有压倒他，在农村的黑暗和战争的风暴中，米特里经受了锻炼，并且找到了真理。
    影片所描写的米特里受折磨的一些场面，是一幅幅揭露人吃人、人压迫人的旧社会的图画。米特里被警察局毒打了一顿的一场戏就是一个例子。他为什么挨打呢？那不过是因为他在自己的哥哥面前，对他的主人——地主克利斯加表示了一点不满，而已经堕落为地主走狗的他的哥哥把他的不满向地主密告了，地主就假手警察局去打了他一顿。在这一场戏里，各个人物的性格得到了鲜明的刻划，同时它也对旧社会作了有力的揭露，对于无依无靠的米特里来说，旧的社会就像一个布置得极为周密的陷阱，只要你稍一表示不满，就立刻受到了严重的迫害。米特里在反动军队里的那些生活场景也留给人们深刻的印象。那无休止的、折磨着人的身体和灵魂的操练，那狂妄而又愚蠢到极点的军官的训话。在那里，几乎每一个士兵都可能被当作小偷来对待，军官在大声地对他们叫道：“你们中间有没有偷东西的？”……在那样的军队里，人的地位和尊严是完全被磨灭了！
    影片着重地描写了米特里的成长过程，描写了他如何在受折磨的生活中一步步地提高了认识。在表现米特里那种天真纯洁的内心，和他对待压迫者的不屈精神方面，影片的描写特别动人。当他拿着粪义对抗那狠狠地追赶着他的伦古——他的哥哥的时候，那是他第一次对生活表示了抗争的态度。在父母的突然逝世以后，他原是满心希望得到他亲生哥哥的同情，那知所得到的却是完全两样——他的哥哥要把他从家里赶出去。生活为什么这么残酷？从他那年幼无知的眼睛里，我们第一次看到了米特里向生活提出了疑问；但是到后来，当他当过了几年长工，受过了很多折磨以后，当他被警察毒打了一顿，从警察局里冲出来，再遇到地主克利斯加的笑脸的时候，米特里已经更进一步地认识地主的诡计和狠毒了。他愤怒地把地主老婆给他的钞票扔在地上，并且用脚踩着。我们在他身上看到了农民对地主的仇恨。
    严酷的生活就是这样地教育着、锻炼着米特里，因而当他得到了党的领导，当他在兵营中遇到了“为穷人的权利而斗争的人”的时候，当他在苏联被俘时期亲眼看到了苏联人民的幸福生活的时候，他很快地就成为一个坚强的为着人民利益而斗争的战士了。
    在米特里身上，我们看到了罗马尼亚农民所有的坚强的毅力，我们看到了他们那种坚定不移的追求真理的精神。尽管困难重重，尽管风吹雨打，但是米特里像一颗茁壮的幼树，坚定地、倔强地往上长。
    影片着重描写的另一个人是米特里的哥哥伦古。他最初虽然并不富有，但作为一个磨坊老板，后来又当上了村长，他已经完全成为地主阶级的附庸和走狗了。通过他向地主克利斯加密告他弟弟表示不满时的一段谈话，影片一针见血地刻划了他的性格。他先说：“我想了好半天才敢来见你，是我老婆叫我来的。”又说：“这话很难说，这是我兄弟的事儿，我可怜他。”这样假装了半天，才说出了他的来意，“他可挺厉害啊……我可不能打他，叫别人打吧。”这是多么愚蠢、无耻和贪婪的脚色。为了霸占自己兄弟的一小块地，为了得到地主阶级的青睐，他已经完全丧失了良知。作为一个腐朽的没落的阶级力量和一个新生的追求人民幸福生活的力量来看，兄弟两人之间的对比是多么强烈！
    米特里，罗马尼亚农民的新的一代，以淳朴善良的心地进入了社会，在现实和党的教育下，找到了生活的真理，看到了新的生活的方向。在这里，影片在描写我们主人公道路的同时，还表现了另一个重要的主题，那就是罗马尼亚普通人民对苏联的友谊，以及统治阶级对苏联的仇视。这两种态度，也几乎成为贯穿着整个故事的一条线索。
    在伦古那里，米特里听到地主阶级对柴纳茨——一个有进步思想的农民的敌视；但是，在柴纳茨大叔那里，少年的米特里第一次看到了一本题为“今日苏联”的书，听说了世界上还有那样一个没有地主克利斯加和磨坊主的国家。
    当罗马尼亚反动政府追随在希特勒后面，将要参加到侵略苏联的战争里去的时候，我们听到了村子里的青年人唱着忧伤的和对统治者充满愤怒的歌。但是地主和伦古却盘算着粮食、羊毛等物资的价格，盘算着他们会在战争里获得暴利。
    在兵营里，米特里的老师同他说明为什么穷人总是那么苦，地主阶级为什么要支持这个战争，他们的将军为什么要叫喊着去参加“最神圣的”战争，叫喊着“元首希特勒万岁”。
    这时候的米特里已经不是年幼无知的小孩了，他已经懂得更多了，当他即将被送往苏联战场的时候，他的爱人娜塔茜亚向他说：“……村子里的人都在掉眼泪，眼看着都要走光了。把咱们送到外国去干么？咱们靠着劳动吃饭的用不着战争。咱们没有什么可争的。”米特里的回答是：“你说的对，我们跟东方那些人没有什么可争的。我们要在这儿战斗！”
    这时候的米特里已经开始有了坚定的目标和明确的意志了，他已经知道谁是真正的朋友，谁是真正的敌人，他已经明白了要按照什么模样去建设自己的新生活。“我们要在这儿战斗！”这就是说，我们不要去侵犯别人，我们要在自己的土地上建立幸福的生活，并且扫除我们自己土地上的一切敌人——这是千百万人民的声音。
    让战争贩子们也来听一听这样的声音吧。自从苏联在地球上出现的时候起，资产阶级的野心家就梦想着消灭苏联，并叫喊着向东进军。一直到今天，也还有一些丧心病狂者在作着这样的打算。他们并没有从历史的经验中取得教训。他们没有意识到他们今天还作着这样的痴心妄想已经狂妄到什么程度！他们忘记了一个事实，就是人民觉醒了，千千万万的米特里已经觉醒了，他们已经从痛苦的生活经验中走过来了。欧洲若干国家的资产阶级政府出卖人民、支持法西斯战争的历史所付的代价是多么惨重，只就罗马尼亚一国来说，为直接参加战争的结果，罗马尼亚人民牺牲了五十多万。影片中所重现的当时战争的若干镜头，它的意义是深重的。今天，罗马尼亚的人民，已经开始掌握了自己的命运，他们正坚决地建设着像苏联那样的生活，并且以新的突击队一员加入了伟大的社会主义阵营，这种团结和友谊的力量，是永远不可战胜的。
    我想，这一点正是影片“理想实现了”的重要主旨，也正是人们热烈欢迎这一影片的原著〔注〕，及第七届国际电影节授予这一影片以“争取社会进步斗争奖”的重要原因。人们在这里看到了他们自己所经历的道路，看到了他们自己对和平生活的愿望和坚定信心。
