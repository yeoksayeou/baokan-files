The Second Department of the Marxist-Leninist Academy has been conducting theoretical teaching for many older cadres for several years, with philosophy as a key course. With many students, few teachers, heavy tasks, and tight schedules, the teaching process encountered many difficulties, and the learning results still have many shortcomings. However, due to the application of our party's rectification study experience, the implementation of the teaching policy of linking theory with practice, the opposition to empiricism and dogmatism in learning methods, and the utilization of the advantageous condition that participating cadres have considerable practical work experience, they were inspired to study hard on their own. Especially with the cooperation of a series of ideological and organizational work of the Party in the teaching process, the difficulties were finally overcome, the teaching tasks were completed, and certain achievements and experiences were obtained. Here is a simple introduction to our summary of the philosophy teaching work in several classes of the Second Department with a total of 500 students. - These classes of students can represent the situation of a large number of middle-level cadres of our party.

I. Basic Situation of Participating Students

The composition of these classes of students is that the vast majority have been party members for more than eight years, equivalent to cadres at the county level or above in the local system (with a few at the provincial level) or at the regiment and division levels in the military system. They have generally been engaged in party work for a long time, have gone through several rectification studies, and have some experience in the party's working methods. That is to say, their experience provides them with convenient conditions for understanding dialectical materialism and historical materialism. In terms of educational level, they originally had a junior high school education or above, with only a few (about 5%) having a higher elementary school education, but they have had a certain amount of training in reading books and documents in party education and in their own work posts. Especially after coming to the Marxist-Leninist Academy, they have been studying for more than half a year, have developed a preliminary habit of studying theory, have a certain understanding of the importance of studying philosophy, and have prepared some preliminary knowledge in history (mainly modern Chinese and foreign revolutionary history) and theory. These conditions enable them to have a certain ability to study difficult classical works on their own. The above are the favorable conditions that can be relied upon when carrying out the philosophical teaching of dialectical materialism and historical materialism among them.

However, there are many obstacles that must be overcome when carrying out philosophy teaching among them. The vast majority of students have never studied philosophy, or at most have only read a little philosophy book sporadically. Only a very few people have some basic understanding of Marxist-Leninist philosophy. Therefore, they have various incorrect views on philosophy. Many people think that philosophy is mysterious and difficult to understand, "unattainable," and that only experts can learn it, and it has nothing to do with themselves; or they think that philosophy is only useful when grasping major policies, so only senior cadres and central leaders need to study philosophy, or simply think that philosophy is all detached from reality, and no philosophy is needed in practical work. These incorrect understandings have a negative impact on the students' confidence and determination to study philosophy, which must be corrected at the beginning of the study.

Because they have been working under the correct leadership of the Party for a long time, these students generally have considerable experience in the Party's working methods, and have made many achievements in their work. However, because they have not studied or have not seriously studied dialectical materialism and historical materialism, they still lack the ability to consciously and independently use Marxist-Leninist methods to analyze problems and solve problems. In general working methods and working styles, many shortcomings are often exposed. The emergence of these errors and shortcomings in work, in terms of the essence of their ideological methods, is precisely because they violate the principles of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, precisely because there are problems of subjectivity, one-sidedness, superficiality, lack of mass viewpoint, and lack of clear class analysis viewpoint in their thinking. From the general appraisal forms and the summaries of each group after the study, the following records can be seen regarding their past ideological shortcomings: "Opinions are not very realistic," "Relying on imagination and inference more than relying on actual materials," "Starting from general concepts," "Unable to be humble and calm," "Emphasizing the past," "Longing for the past," "Making comprehensive conclusions from one side of the problem," "Left is better than right," "In work, generally starting from the instructions of superiors, not combining with the specific conditions of the local area," "Using the framework of experience to put on some phenomena of things as the basis for handling problems and solving problems," "Poor mass viewpoint," "Valuing great figures more than valuing the masses," "Trusting oneself more than trusting the masses." This kind of shortcoming in ideological methods is universal among these students. When carrying out the teaching of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, if they are not inspired to criticize and correct these shortcomings in ideological methods, it is impossible to truly complete the teaching task.

Inseparable from the above incorrect understanding is the lack of understanding of the principle of the connection between Marxist-Leninist theory and practice. Some students believe that people who understand theory cannot necessarily do practical work, and people who can do practical work do not necessarily understand theory, so they think that theory has nothing to do with practical work. Some even divide theory into two parts: one part is the policy that is related to work and guides practice, and the other part is Marxist-Leninism that is not related to work and is only used for propaganda. Although the students all know that Comrade Mao Zedong's works are a model of the combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and the specific reality of the Chinese revolution, few people can understand the true meaning of this mutual combination. The lack of understanding of the principle of linking theory with practice is manifested in various incorrect learning methods and learning attitudes in learning. For example, some people are complacent with their certain work experience and do not pay attention to the necessity of studying philosophy to improve their understanding. Others simply hold the attitude of learning more knowledge, blindly expanding the scope of reading, or putting the main effort into pondering the problems of nouns and concepts, while ignoring the task of linking with reality to transform their thinking. If these errors are not clarified, learning cannot proceed smoothly.

In addition, students generally lack natural science knowledge, which will make it difficult to understand the worldview of dialectical materialism, and should be properly solved.

II. Tasks, Principles, Methods, and Steps of Philosophy Teaching

Our philosophy teaching is aimed at the above-mentioned basic situation of the students to stipulate our own tasks, principles, methods, and steps.

The teaching task of dialectical materialism and historical materialism is to help students clarify the mysterious views on philosophy and other incorrect understandings, so that they clearly recognize that dialectical materialism and historical materialism are the methodological weapons used by Marxists-Leninists to understand and transform the world; to make them clearly recognize that our party's correct program, line, policy, instructions, etc. are all based on the principles of dialectical materialism and historical materialism and the specific actual situation of Chinese society and the Chinese revolution, and the Party's set of scientific working methods and working styles are also generated and developed on the basis of Marxist-Leninist principles; to make them clearly recognize why Stalin said that dialectical materialism is the worldview of the Marxist-Leninist party, why Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" that the proletarian worldview is the tool for us to observe the fate of the country, why the Party requires us to take dialectical materialism and historical materialism as the only methodological principles for us to study problems and handle work, and should not adopt other methods, and why violating this methodological principle is a manifestation of lack of party spirit or impure party spirit. Through these understandings, students will be able to consciously strive to correct their erroneous ideological methods, working methods and working styles that violate the principles of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, correct their original problems of subjectivity, one-sidedness and superficiality in understanding, as well as the problems of lack of mass viewpoint and clear class analysis methods and class struggle viewpoints, consciously strive to learn and master the correct Marxist-Leninist ideological methods, working methods and working styles, learn to use the principles of dialectical materialism and historical materialism to analyze problems and solve problems, to understand the laws of surrounding events and the development of work, to understand the scientific correctness of the Party's theories, programs, lines, policies and instructions, to sum up work experience, to find out the ideological roots of why successful experience is successful and why failed experience is failed, so that it is possible to accumulate successful experience and avoid repeating mistakes.

The principles of philosophy teaching should be consistent with our tasks. The general teaching principle of the Marxist-Leninist Academy is: "Study theory, improve understanding, link with practice, transform thinking." This principle is also in line with our Party's traditional rectification study principle. Our philosophy teaching also adheres to this principle. The meaning of this principle is to guide students to study the theoretical principles of dialectical materialism and historical materialism in a more systematic way, and apply these principles to observe practical problems, understand the Party's program, line, and policies, examine their own work and thinking, turn these principles into their own ideological weapons, into scientific methods for analyzing problems, solving problems, and handling work, and transform their original erroneous ideological methods. In short, it is to achieve the purpose of transforming thinking and establishing a correct Marxist-Leninist set of worldviews, ideological methods, working methods, and working styles through systematic study of philosophical theory. This principle is also the principle of linking theory with practice, which contains the meaning of opposing both dogmatism and empiricism. One-sidedly emphasizing the study of theory, thus only paying attention to studying books, circling in concepts and nouns, but not paying attention to linking with actual life, unwilling to examine one's own work and thinking, and transforming one's own thinking, is the dogmatic learning tendency. Not paying attention to studying theory, understanding the spiritual essence of Marxist-Leninist classical works, and appropriately, with emphasis, gradually deepening, and gradually linking with practice in multiple ways with the progress of learning, but rushing to comprehensively examine work and thinking too early, turning learning and discussion into casual talks about work lacking theoretical guidance, or even replacing principled criticism and self-criticism with disputes over trivial matters of life, is the empirical learning tendency. The above tendencies are often encountered in the teaching process, and must be corrected at any time in order to implement the correct teaching principles.

According to the above-mentioned teaching tasks and principles, based on the basic situation of the students and the teaching conditions of the Marxist-Leninist Academy (few teachers, many students, many classes), the basic teaching method we adopted is to guide students to actively study on their own through the teacher's inspiring lectures, plus appropriate guidance in the learning process, and give full play to the role of their own advantageous conditions, that is, through their own practical work experience, their understanding of the Party's line and policies, and the Party's working methods and working styles that they have experienced to understand the principles of Marxist-Leninist philosophy, so as to gradually overcome the difficulties encountered in their learning and complete the learning tasks. Using this method, the following steps are generally taken:

1.  Before the start of the study, make a general mobilization report, explaining the importance of studying philosophy, that is, explaining that studying dialectical materialism and historical materialism is an important key to studying Marxism-Leninism, explaining the teaching plan (including reading, lecturing, tutoring, discussion, summary, etc., a total of four and a half months to five months of learning process plan), repeatedly explaining our teaching tasks and principles, and giving appropriate criticism to certain emotions and attitudes that exist among students that contradict the teaching tasks and principles, clarifying the mysterious views and erroneous views on philosophy held by students, and dispelling their concerns about insufficient confidence in studying philosophy and other ideological obstacles. The reading plan mainly uses Marxist-Leninist classical works related to philosophy as teaching materials, such as: Engels' "Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy," "Socialism: Utopian and Scientific," "Anti-Dühring" (selected readings); Lenin's "Materialism and Empirio-criticism"; Stalin's "Dialectical and Historical Materialism," "Anarchism or Socialism?," "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics," "Economic Problems of Socialism in the U.S.S.R."; Mao Zedong's "On Practice," "On Contradiction," and several reports in the rectification movement. There are also articles in Comrade Mao Zedong's works that can directly inspire the study of philosophy. In addition, the Party's current important policy documents and various important work reports are used as necessary reference materials for linking with practice. The above reading materials and reference materials are appropriately distributed in each learning unit according to the teaching progress, such as "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" is assigned to the materialism unit for reading. After each unit's inspiring lectures by teachers, enter the reading process, and organize group discussions. If necessary, select more important issues that are more universally controversial to organize a class-based large discussion. Finally, each person writes a learning summary once, and each person writes a thought summary again at the end of the entire course.

2.  In each learning unit, the teacher first makes an inspiring lecture. The content of the lecture, on the one hand, is to systematically explain the principles of Marxist-Leninist philosophy, clearly draw the boundaries between materialism and idealism, dialectics and metaphysics, historical materialism and historical idealism, collectivism and individualism, proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology. At the same time, it must combine the explanation of theoretical principles with the Party's various programs, lines, policies, and historical experience. In particular, the Party's general line during the transition period and the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party should be taken as the focus of linking with practice in the current teaching. In this way, students are inspired to understand why the Party's correct line, policies, and successful struggle experience are in line with the principles of dialectical materialism and historical materialism in terms of ideological methods, and the various errors in work are ultimately related to idealism, metaphysics, individualism, and non-proletarian ideology. Students understand that Marxism-Leninism is a consistently systematic and rigorous science from worldview to working style that links theory with practice. They understand that the most fundamental problem of linking theory with practice is to grasp the Marxist-Leninist stand, viewpoint, and method, that is, to grasp dialectical materialism and historical materialism to analyze and solve the actual problems in our work, that is, to oppose subjectivity, one-sidedness, and superficiality in thinking when dealing with actual work and actual problems, the lack of mass viewpoint, and the lack of the proletarian class struggle viewpoint. If the above content of the teacher's lectures still has places that students cannot understand or cannot deeply understand, it should be solved in the tutoring and discussion process. One of the tasks of tutoring is to help students understand some difficult classical works and answer the questions they raised, but it must be noted that the above-mentioned principle of linking theory with practice is the center, and avoid simply doing technical and noun-concept tutoring. Discussions must focus on the theoretical and practical issues raised in the study. Regardless of teaching, tutoring, and discussion, it is necessary to avoid getting entangled in some meaningless problems, such as "Where is the contradiction between the teacup and the table?"

3.  In order to make students closely understand the meaning of linking theory with practice and learn to grasp the Marxist-Leninist stand, viewpoint, and method to analyze and solve practical problems, the central key, the first step, lies in guiding them to raise questions based on their own work practice and ideological practice to solve them. This is not only because linking with one's own personal experience is the most convenient and easiest method to understand, but also because only through this method can the purpose of transforming thinking and transforming working style be achieved, making the scientific method of Marxism-Leninism truly one's own thing, and using this as a basis, it is possible to further link with practical problems that are broader than one's own direct experience. Therefore, transforming thinking is not only our learning task, but also a basic part of our learning method. The correctness and effectiveness of this method have been proven by the results of our Party's previous rectification experiences, and our appropriate application to philosophy teaching is also correct and effective. The specific application of this method is that the teacher learns about the students' historical and ideological situation through the Party organization before the lecture, and appropriately selects some similar examples in the lecture to analyze and criticize. That is to say, the teacher's lecture should not only link with the actual social and historical events and the actual Party's program and policies as mentioned in the previous section, but also directly link with the actual thinking of the students in the classroom. Through this lecture method that links with the actual thinking of the students, the students can be inspired to also appropriately reflect on their own thinking, work, and history when studying classical works, and promote the students to unfold criticism and self-criticism on the problems existing in each other's work and thinking in the post-class group discussions, especially in the process of writing learning summaries or thought summaries, so that each student can understand the correctness of the principles of dialectical materialism and historical materialism through the successful experience in their own work, and understand the harmful effects of subjective, superficial, and one-sided thinking, as well as bourgeois individualism, through their own mistakes and failures. It must be noted here that the connection between theory and practice also has its development process, and the connection with the students' ideological reality must be carried out step by step and with emphasis along with the progress of teaching. For example, when studying materialism, focus on solving the problem of subjectivity of thought, when studying dialectics, focus on solving the problem of one-sidedness and superficiality of thought, and when studying historical materialism, focus on solving the lack of mass viewpoint and class struggle viewpoint.

4.  Regarding the difficulty of students lacking natural science knowledge, the main solution is to appropriately organize some special reports, such as special reports on Michurin's theory in natural science, screening various scientific films, etc.

Finally, it should be noted that the implementation of the above teaching principles, tasks, methods, and steps must obtain the cooperation of a series of ideological and organizational work of the Party organization. The Party organization takes ensuring and supervising the teaching staff and students in their work and study to correctly implement the teaching principles as the central link of its ideological leadership work, and pays attention to preventing the occurrence of erroneous tendencies of dogmatically treating Marxism-Leninism among the teaching staff and students at any time, and carries out criticism and education on various tendencies that deviate from the teaching principles. The Party promotes students to give play to their consciousness of caring for each other's learning and caring for their own thinking and self-study enthusiasm through its own branches and groups, so as to understand and study the ideological and learning situation of all students, find out the existing problems in the group discussion process or in the process of making ideological summaries and thought summaries, and solve them with leadership and step by step through appropriate criticism and self-criticism. In this way, the task of combining the teaching work with the actual thinking of the students and transforming their thinking can be smoothly realized. In short, there must be a series of ideological and organizational work of the Party to make the teaching principles become the actions of the teaching staff and the students, and make them correctly implemented.

III. The Harvest of Philosophy Teaching

As a result of conducting philosophy teaching according to the above tasks, principles, methods, and steps, certain achievements have been received. This first broke the students' mysterious views on philosophy and various erroneous views, and universally believed that philosophy is something that "can be learned and must be learned." After learning, the students not only understood the basic theoretical principles of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, but also began to understand its practical significance. For example, after studying the materialism unit, they were able to distinguish the boundary between materialism and idealism based on the principle of the relationship between thinking and existence, and were able to understand why we must "proceed from reality" when engaging in actual work and solving practical problems, we must first pay attention to "investigation and research," and we must achieve consistency between subjective and objective. Many comrades examined their past mistakes in land reform, revolutionary war, and urban work based on the principles of materialism, and understood that the root of erroneous ideological methods lies in violating the principles of materialism's epistemology, violating the principles of reflection, and splitting subjective and objective, thus falling into the blindness of subjectivism. A group summarized this way: "The slogan of proceeding from reality is not unfamiliar to these comrades, but everyone did not really know how to proceed from reality, and did not understand that this contains the fundamental principles of Marxist-Leninist philosophy. This time, everyone realized that to overcome the subjective ideological method, we must have a clear materialist viewpoint." For another example, after studying the law of contradiction of dialectics, the students understood that the significance of this law is to require us to make a comprehensive and specific analysis of all aspects of the contradiction of things when studying and solving problems, and we must oppose the one-sidedness of metaphysics. Then they reviewed the one-sidedness of their past views on many practical problems--such as the relationship between the Party's general line and the Party's specific policies, the relationship between new and old cadres, the relationship between old area work and new area work, the relationship between the Party and the individual, as well as the relationship between their own advantages and disadvantages, success and failure in work, etc. As a result of studying historical materialism, the students have gained a more systematic understanding of the material basis of production for society, the decisive force of the masses in creating history, the driving force of class struggle for the development of class society, as well as the correct relationship between the base and the superstructure, social existence and social consciousness, and have solved many practical problems in their work, especially universally reviewed their historical idealist viewpoint of overemphasizing the role of personal heroes and neglecting the power of the masses.

It can be seen from the above examples that studying philosophy has greatly improved the level of the students' Marxism-Leninism, and one of the most significant signs of this improvement in level is that after studying philosophy, their comprehension ability and interest in reading classical works, especially Comrade Mao Zedong's works, have significantly increased, their understanding of the Party's line and policies, etc., is much deeper than before, and they can improve to the philosophical principles of Marxism-Leninism to understand, so their interest and confidence in studying theory have been greatly strengthened. They said, "Now reading Chairman Mao's works, I feel that between the lines, the spirit of dialectical materialism and historical materialism is jumping in front of our eyes"; "In the past, I knew what the Party's policies were, but I didn't know why they were so. This is the root of our wavering and making mistakes in our work. Now I understand how to use the Marxist-Leninist philosophical viewpoint to observe social history and observe social life, and then understand that the formulation of the Party's policies is based on the laws of social production development. This is very important for overcoming blindness in future work and improving policy and ideological level." These are representative reflections in the study.

The improvement of understanding is inseparable from the effect of ideological transformation. After studying philosophy, the students' ideological style began to have some significant changes. The most important thing is that they showed a more humble and serious attitude towards their shortcomings and mistakes than before. Criticism and self-criticism gradually and naturally developed universally with the progress of learning. Especially after learning the principle that criticism and self-criticism are the driving force for the development of socialist society, criticism and self-criticism gained theoretical conscious guidance and developed even more. Some people wrote: "To transform one's own thinking, we must first go through inner struggle, and we cannot rely entirely on external causes." The students have been educated by the Party in the past, and have a considerable understanding of the importance of ideological transformation and criticism and self-criticism, but everyone believes that they have never gained the most profound understanding from the fundamental ideological basis as they did in this philosophy study. Almost every class and every group has people saying in unison: "Such a profound education is the first time since I participated in the revolution!"

IV. Several Main Experiences of Teaching

As mentioned above, our philosophy teaching objects are the numerous middle-level cadres of our Party. They have considerable practical work experience, but lack a more systematic Marxist-Leninist theoretical arming, first of all, they have not consciously mastered the weapons of Marxist-Leninist ideological methods. If we use Comrade Mao Zedong's analogy of "shooting the arrow at the target" to illustrate the correct Marxist-Leninist learning method, then the philosophical teaching task for these cadres is mainly to hand the "arrow" of Marxist-Leninist ideological methods to them, so that they can learn to use it to shoot the "target" of Chinese revolutionary practice (including the reality of their own work and thinking), so that they can improve from the general situation of having some practical experience and generally understanding some of the Party's working principles to the level of being able to consciously apply the principles of dialectical materialism and historical materialism to study and solve problems. The question is how to hand this "arrow" to them to master, that is, how to improve these cadres ideologically. The philosophy teaching of the Marxist-Leninist Academy has initially touched on some experience in solving this problem, and this experience should be said to be universally applicable to general middle-level cadres - including some senior cadres.

The essence of the philosophy teaching method lies in implementing the spirit of closely linking theory with practice, and lies in fully mastering the principle of "studying theory, improving understanding, linking with practice, and transforming thinking." First of all, we must make our cadres study some classical works and systematically study philosophical theory, because this is the main aspect that they lack. However, to truly transform the theory in books into something that cadres can master themselves, it is not easy to achieve the goal by relying solely on dead reading of books or lecturing on general principles. To achieve this goal, the most effective entry method is to follow the experience of our Party's rectification study and make students use the principles learned from the books and lectures to examine their own work experience and ideological style. This is more convenient for cadres with some work experience. Without "studying theory and improving understanding," there is no "arrow," and there is no point in studying Marxism-Leninism. Without "linking with practice and transforming thinking," and without aiming the "arrow" at a certain "target" to shoot, it is impossible to experience the role of the "arrow," and it is impossible to truly improve understanding and understand the spiritual essence of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, the philosophy teaching method must guide students to pay attention to learning and applying at the same time, studying theoretical principles and considering its practical significance at the same time. We should not separate the study of theory and the link with practice in the learning process. Naturally, this does not mean that all aspects of the above-mentioned sixteen-character principle must appear equally at the same time at any time. It is permissible and should be to focus on mastering a certain aspect of the entire principle in different stages of the learning process. For example, when listening to lectures and reading, focus on studying the theoretical content, and when making learning summaries or summaries, focus on linking with practice, especially examining one's own work and thinking. However, when focusing on studying theoretical principles, we must appropriately pay attention to considering the practical significance of each theoretical principle in our life and work, so as to avoid falling into dogmatic and empty understanding of theoretical principles. When focusing on examining our own work and ideological reality, we must always pay attention to the guidance of theoretical principles, so as to avoid falling into the casual talks of narrow empiricism in work.

The so-called practice must not be narrowly regarded as just personal direct experience. We take the examination of personal work and thinking as the central link of linking theory with practice, because this is an effective entry method for learning philosophy and general Marxist-Leninist theory, because it is not easy to transform theoretical principles into something that we can truly and closely understand without doing so, but it is by no means to say that this is the entire method. Through this entry method, we must guide students to link with broader practice - the practice of natural science, the practice of production, the practice of class struggle, etc., to deepen the students' understanding of dialectical materialism and historical materialism as the scientific method of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, in the teaching process, we must appropriately use knowledge of the natural world, social history, international and domestic class struggle, and the Party's policies and lines to enrich the content of learning, and especially to understand the Party's policies, lines, especially the Party's general line and general tasks during the transition period, and the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party as the focus and destination of all philosophy teaching from the basis of Marxist-Leninist ideological methods. Precisely because of this, after the entire philosophy course teaching has ended, we cannot say that the study of philosophy has come to an end from then on. After turning to the study of other courses (such as the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) and the History of the Communist Party of China, etc.), we must also inspire students to continue to use the methodological weapons obtained from philosophy learning to understand the content of these courses, and continuously deepen and improve their understanding of Marxist-Leninist philosophy - the scientific ideological method - through the study of these courses.

The teaching experience of our several classes has proved that the implementation of the above-mentioned principle of linking theory with practice is bound to be met with ideological resistance of varying degrees of non-Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, if we do not try to guide students to carry out criticism and self-criticism in the teaching process, learning is difficult to move forward. We must correctly master the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to make it a driving force for realizing ideological transformation and promoting learning progress. Our philosophy teaching has continuously carried out the necessary and appropriate ideological struggle from the initial mobilization and inspiring report, lectures, tutoring, discussions, to the final ideological summary. As an ideological struggle of the teaching method, it should be based on the principle of combining adhering to serious criticism and self-criticism with paying attention to the attitude of seeking truth from facts in criticism. That is, on the one hand, resolutely oppose liberalism, and on the other hand, appropriately prevent stiff and excessive struggles. The combination of these two aspects must be emphasized differently with the development of learning and changes in the students' ideological situation. According to the experience of our several classes, before studying the dialectical materialism unit, we focused more on opposing liberalism to inspire the development of criticism and self-criticism. When criticism and self-criticism has been universally carried out and the tendency of liberalism has been basically overcome, generally in the historical materialism unit, especially when making ideological summaries in the end, we must pay attention to appropriately preventing stiff and excessive struggles.

To ensure the smooth completion of the philosophy teaching tasks, the collective leadership in the teaching organization is an indispensable condition. The following points should be mainly noted: First, the teachers must be fully prepared and personally responsible for the content they teach. On the other hand, the teaching materials must be collectively reviewed. At least the explanations of certain important issues, especially the answers to new issues, must be collectively discussed. We must oppose individualism and decentralism in teaching work, oppose individuals arbitrarily expressing opinions as if they were correct, so as to avoid errors in lectures as much as possible, or inconsistencies in the way the same problem is taught among different teachers, making students at a loss. Second, teachers, tutors, and students - especially the backbone members of the branch, class, and group - must closely contact each other in order to understand the students' history, ideological situation, and learning development, so that the content of lectures and tutoring can be tailored to the students' ideological reality and fully implement the principle of linking reality with transforming thinking. Here we must oppose the teaching bureaucracy that is divorced from the student masses. Third, we must organize collective mutual assistance among students, which is an important method to supplement the insufficient teaching strength in the case of few teachers, many students, and many classes. Mutual assistance among students should include mutual assistance on reading technical issues (such as technical difficulties caused by misunderstanding of certain noun concepts and lack of certain natural and historical common sense), mutual assistance on understanding theoretical principles, and especially emphasizing mutual assistance on ideological aspects, when making learning summaries or summaries, mutual assistance when examining their own work and thinking. In this sense, mutual criticism should also be regarded as a form of mutual assistance.

Finally, I want to reiterate that to ensure the smooth completion of the philosophy teaching tasks, there must be a series of ideological and organizational work cooperation of the Party, and there must be the Party's supervision and guarantee for the work of the teaching staff and for the students' learning. The reason has been said before, and I will not talk about it here.

    马克思列宁学院第二部哲学教学的经验
    马克思列宁学院第二部几年来对许多较老的干部进行了理论教学工作，并把哲学作为一个重点的课程。在学员多、教员少、任务重、时间紧的情况下，教学过程中曾遇到许多困难，学习的结果也还有不少缺点，但由于应用了我党整风学习的经验，贯彻了理论联系实际的教学方针，反对了经验主义和教条主义的学习方法，同时又利用参加学习的干部们都拥有相当的实际工作经验这个有利条件，启发他们努力自学，特别是在教学过程中有着党的一系列的思想工作和组织工作的配合，终于克服了困难，完成了教学任务，并取得了一定的成绩和经验。这里把我们对于第二部几个班共五百多同学中的哲学教学工作总结作一个简单的介绍。——这几班的学员能代表我党为数众多的中级干部的情形。
    一、参加学习的学员的基本情况
    这几班学员的成份，绝大多数都是有八年以上党龄的，相当于地方系统县级以上（有少数省级的）或军队系统团级和师级的干部。他们一般都是长期地做过党的工作，经过了几次整风学习，对于党的工作方法是有些体会的。这就是说，他们的经历为他们提供了领会辩证唯物论和历史唯物论的便利条件。就文化程度来说，他们原来都有初中以上的文化程度，只有少数（百分之五左右）是高小程度，但在党内教育和在自己的工作岗位中有了阅读书籍文件的一定的锻炼。尤其是来马克思列宁学院以后，已经学习了半年以上，具有了钻研理论的初步的习惯，对于学习哲学的重要性也已经有了一定的认识，并准备了若干历史的（主要是近代中外革命史）和理论方面的预备知识。这些条件使他们对于困难的经典著作也具备了一定的自己钻研的能力。以上就是在他们中间进行辩证唯物论和历史唯物论的哲学教学时可以依靠的有利条件。
    但在他们中间进行哲学教学，是有着许多必须克服的障碍的。绝大多数的同学从来都是没有学过哲学，或至多只是零碎看过一点哲学书，只有极少数的人对马克思列宁主义哲学有若干基本的理解。因此，他们对于哲学就有着各种不正确的看法。很多人认为哲学是神秘难懂的，“可望而不可即的”，以为只有专家才能学，而与自己无缘；或者以为哲学只在掌握大的方针的时候才有用，因此只有高级干部，中央领导同志才需要学习哲学，或者干脆认为哲学都是脱离实际的学问，在实际工作中不需要任何哲学。这些错误的认识，对于学员学习哲学的信心和决心都有着消极的影响，是在学习开始时就必须加以纠正的。
    由于长期地在党的正确领导之下做工作，这些同学对于党的工作方法一般地都有相当的体会，并且在他们的工作中也曾做出许多的成绩。但是因为没有学过或没有认真学过辩证唯物论和历史唯物论，因此仍缺乏自觉地、独立地运用马克思列宁主义方法去分析问题、解决问题的能力。而在一般的工作方法、工作作风上，经常要暴露许多缺点。这些工作中的错误和缺点的产生，就其思想方法的本质来说，正是由于违背了辩证唯物论和历史唯物论的原理原则，正是由于在思想上存在着主观性、片面性、表面性，缺乏群众观点和明确的阶级分析观点的毛病，从一般的鉴定表上以及学习后各组的总结里，可以看到关于他们过去的思想缺点有如下的记录：“意见不大合乎实际”，“依靠想像推断多于依靠实际材料”，“从一般概念出发”，“不能虚心、冷静”，“强调过去”，“怀恋过去”，
  “从问题的一面作出全盘的结论”，“左比右好”，
  “在工作中一般是从上级指示出发，不结合当地的具体情况”，“用经验框子，套上事物的某些现象，作为处理问题、解决问题的根据”，“群众观点差”，“重视伟大人物多于重视群众”，“相信群众不如相信自己”。这一类的思想方法上的缺点，在这些学员中间是带普遍性的。在进行辩证唯物论和历史唯物论教学时，如果不启发他们就这些思想方法上的缺点来给予批评和改正，是不可能真正完成教学任务的。
    和以上的错误认识分不开的，是对于马克思列宁主义的理论与实际联系这一个原则的不大了解。一些学员们认为，懂理论的人不一定能做实际工作，而能做实际工作的人不一定懂理论，因此认为理论与实际工作没有关系。甚至于还有人把理论分为两部分，一部分是与工作有关的指导实际的政策，一部分是与工作无关的只供宣传之用的马克思列宁主义。学员们虽然都知道毛泽东同志的著作是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命的具体实际相结合的典范，但很少人能了解这个相互结合的真正意义。对于理论联系实际的原理的不大了解，在学习中就表现为各种不正确的学习方法和学习态度。例如有的人以自己有某些工作经验而自满自足，对于学习哲学提高认识的必要性不予以重视，也有的人单纯地抱着多学些知识的态度来学习，盲目地扩大阅读范围，或把主要的力量用来推敲名词概念的问题，而忽视了联系实际改造思想的任务。这些错误若不加以澄清，学习是无法顺利进行的。
    此外，学员们一般都缺少自然科学知识，这在理解辩证唯物论的世界观上会感到一定困难的，应当适当地设法予以解决。
    二、哲学教学的任务、方针、方法和步骤
    我们的哲学教学，就是针对着上述学员们的基本情况，来规定自己的任务、方针、方法和步骤的。
    辩证唯物论和历史唯物论的教学任务，就是要帮助学员们澄清对于哲学的神秘观点以及其他不正确的认识，使他们明确地认识到辩证唯物论和历史唯物论是马克思列宁主义者用来认识世界和改造世界的方法武器；使他们明确地认识到我党的正确的纲领、路线、政策、指示等等，都是依据辩证唯物论和历史唯物论的原理和中国社会和中国革命的具体实际情况来确定的，党的一套科学的工作方法和工作作风，也都是在马克思列宁主义原则的基础上产生和发展起来的；就是要使他们明确地认识到为什么斯大林要说辩证唯物论是马克思列宁主义党的世界观，为什么毛泽东同志在“论人民民主专政”里说无产阶级的宇宙观是我们观察国家命运的工具，为什么党要求我们一定要把辩证唯物论和历史唯物论作为我们研究问题和处理工作的唯一的方法原理，而不应该采用另外的方法，为什么违背了这个方法原理就是缺乏党性或党性不纯的表现。通过这些认识，学员们就能进而自觉地努力改正自己的与辩证唯物论和历史唯物论原理原则相违背的错误的思想方法、工作方法和工作作风，改正自己原来的认识上的主观性、片面性和表面性的毛病以及缺乏群众观点和明确的阶级分析方法、阶级斗争观点的毛病，自觉地努力学习掌握正确的马克思列宁主义的思想方法、工作方法和工作作风，学习运用辩证唯物论和历史唯物论的原理来分析问题和解决问题，来理解周围事变发展和工作发展的规律，来领会党的理论、纲领、路线、政策和指示等等的科学的正确性，来总结工作经验，来找出成功的经验之所以成功和失败的经验之所以失败的思想方法上的根源，以便有可能积累成功的经验，避免重复错误。
    哲学教学的方针，是应该与我们的任务符合的。马克思列宁学院的一般的教学方针是：“学习理论，提高认识，联系实际，改造思想”。这个方针也符合着我们党的传统的整风学习方针，我们的哲学教学，也坚持了这一个方针。这个方针的意义就是要引导学员们较有系统地钻研辩证唯物论和历史唯物论的理论原理，并应用这些原理原则来观察实际问题，领会党的纲领、路线、政策，检查自己的工作和思想，把这些原理原则变为自己的思想武器，变为自己分析问题、解决问题、处理工作的科学方法，并改造自己原有的错误思想方法。简单地说，就是要通过哲学理论的系统的学习以达到改造思想，树立马克思列宁主义的一套正确的世界观、思想方法、工作方法和工作作风的目的。这个方针也就是理论联系实际的方针，它包含着既反对教条主义又反对经验主义的意义。片面地强调学习理论，因而只注意钻研书本，在概念名词里打圈子，而不注意联系实际生活，不愿意检查自己的工作和思想，改造自己的思想，这是教条主义的学习偏向。不注意钻研理论，领会马克思列宁主义经典著作的精神实质，并随着学习的进度适当地、有重点地、逐步深入、逐步多方面地联系实际，而是过早地急于全面检查工作和思想，把学习讨论变成缺乏理论指导的工作漫谈，甚至于把生活琐事的纠纷代替有原则的批评与自我批评，这是经验主义的学习偏向。以上的偏向，是在教学过程中常常要遇到的，为了贯彻正确的教学方针，必须随时加以纠正。
    根据上述的教学任务和方针，根据学员的基本情况和马克思列宁学院的教学条件（教员少，学员多，班次多），我们所采用的基本教学方法，就是通过教员的启发性的讲授，加上学习过程中的适当的辅导，引导学员积极自学，发挥他们自己所具有的有利条件的作用，也就是通过他们自己的实际工作经验，他们对于党的路线政策的了解和自己体验过的党的工作方法工作作风，来领会马克思列宁主义哲学的原理原则，这样来逐步克服他们学习中所遇到的困难，完成学习的任务。运用这样的方法，一般地是采取以下的步骤的。
    一、在学习开始之前作一个总的动员报告，说明学习哲学的重要性，也就是说明学习辩证唯物论和历史唯物论是学习马克思列宁主义的重要关键，交代教学计划（包括阅读、讲课、辅导、讨论、总结等共四个半月到五个月的学习进程计划），反复地解释我们的教学任务和方针，针对着在学员中存在的某些与教学任务和方针相抵触的情绪、态度给予适当的批评，澄清学员中对于哲学所抱的神秘观点和错误看法，解除他们对于学习哲学信心不足的顾虑以及其他思想障碍。阅读计划主要是以马克思列宁主义有关哲学的经典著作作为教材，如：恩格斯的“费尔巴哈与德国古典哲学的终结”，“社会主义从空想到科学的发展”，“反杜林论”（选读部分）；列宁的“唯物论与经验批判论”；斯大林的“辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义”，“无政府主义还是社会主义？”，“马克思主义与语言学问题”，“苏联社会主义经济问题”；毛泽东同志的
  “实践论”，“矛盾论”和整风运动中的几次报告。还有毛泽东同志著作中对于学习哲学能够直接有所启发的文章。此外，党在当前的重要政策文件及各种重要工作报告，都作为联系实际的必要参考材料。以上阅读的教材和参考材料，是按照教学进度，适当分配在各个学习单元里，如“唯物论与经验批判论”分配在唯物论单元里来阅读。在每一单元教员的启发讲授以后，进入阅读过程，并组织小组讨论，必要时选择较重要的比较普遍地引起争论的问题来组织以班为单位的大讨论，最后每人写一次学习小结，在全部课程学完时每人再写一次思想总结。
    二、在各个学习单元中，首先由教员作启发性的讲授。讲课内容一方面是要比较有系统地阐明马克思列宁主义哲学原理，明确划清唯物论与唯心论，辩证法与形而上学，历史唯物论与历史唯心论，集体主义与个人主义，无产阶级思想与资产阶级思想的界限，同时又必须把理论原理的阐明与党的各项纲领、路线、政策，党的历史经验结合起来，特别要把党在过渡时期的总路线和党的七届四中全会的决议作为当前教学中联系实际的重点，这样来启发同学们领会为什么党的正确的路线、政策以及成功的斗争经验在思想方法基础上都是符合于辩证唯物论和历史唯物论的原理的，而工作中的各种错误归根结底是与唯心论、形而上学、个人主义以及非无产阶级思想相联系的；使学员们了解马克思列宁主义是理论与实际联系的从宇宙观到工作作风一贯地系统严整的科学，使他们了解理论与实际联系的最根本的问题，就是要掌握马克思列宁主义的立场、观点、方法，也就是要掌握辩证唯物论和历史唯物论来分析和解决我们工作中的实际问题，就是要反对在处理实际工作实际问题时思想上的主观性，片面性，表面性，缺乏群众观点，缺乏无产阶级的阶级斗争观点等等。以上教员的讲授内容如果在学员中还有不能领会或不能深入领会的地方，就应该在辅导和讨论过程中加以解决。辅导的任务之一是帮助同学来理解某些困难的经典著作内容，解答他们所提出的问题，但必须注意以上述理论联系实际的原理作为中心，避免单纯地只作技术上和名词概念上的辅导。讨论必须着重针对学习中提出的具有一定理论的和实际意义的问题。不论教课、辅导和讨论，都必须避免纠缠一些毫无实际意义的问题，如“茶杯和桌子的矛盾何在”之类。
    三、为要使学员亲切地了解理论与实际联系的意义，学会掌握马克思列宁主义的立场、观点和方法来分析和解决实际问题，其中心关键，第一步，就在于要引导他们就自己本身的工作实际和思想实际来提出问题加以解决。这不仅因为联系自己亲身经历的实际是一个最便利和最容易领会的方法，而且因为只有通过这个方法才能达到改造思想和改造工作作风的目的，使马克思列宁主义的科学方法成为真正自己的东西，以此作为基础，才有可能进一步联系比自己的直接经验更为广泛的实际问题。所以，改造思想不只是我们的学习任务，也是我们学习方法的一个基本部分，这个方法的正确性和有效性，是我党历次整风经验的成果所证明了的，而我们适当地应用到哲学教学中，也是正确有效的。这个方法的具体运用，就是教员在讲课之前通过党组织来了解同学的历史情况和思想情况，在讲课中适当选择一些类例来加以分析批判，这就是说，教员讲课不只要像前节所说的那样联系社会历史事变的实际和党的纲领政策的实际，而且要直接联系课堂中学员思想的实际。通过这样联系学员思想实际的讲授方法，就可以给学员们以启发，使他们在钻研经典著作的时候，也要适当反省自己的思想、工作和历史，在课后小组讨论中特别是写学习小结或思想总结的过程中，也要推动学员们就相互间的工作和思想中所存在的问题展开批评与自我批评，使每个同学通过自己工作中的成功经验来领会辩证唯物论和历史唯物论原理的正确性，通过自己的错误和失败的经验来领会思想的主观性、表面性、片面性，以及资产阶级个人主义思想的危害作用。这里必须注意一点：理论联系实际也是有其发展的过程的，对学员的思想实际的联系，必须是随着教学的进程有步骤有重点地进行。例如学习唯物论时着重解决思想的主观性问题，学习辩证法时着重解决思想的片面性和表面性的问题，学习历史唯物论时着重解决缺乏群众观点和阶级斗争观点等等。
    四、关于学员们缺乏自然科学知识的困难问题，主要的解决的办法是适当地组织一些专题报告，如自然科学方面的米丘林学说的专题报告，放映各种科学影片等等。
    最后应该注意到的是：以上教学方针、任务、方法和步骤的执行，必须取得党组织的一系列思想工作和组织工作的配合。党组织把保证、监督教学工作人员和学员在他们的工作与学习中正确贯彻教学方针，作为自己思想领导工作的中心环节，随时注意防止教学工作人员和学员中教条式地对待马克思列宁主义的错误倾向的发生，对各种脱离教学方针的倾向进行批评教育。党经过自己的支部和小组，推动学员发挥他们互相关心学习、关心思想的自觉性和自学的积极性，从而对全体学员的思想情况和学习情况进行了解和研究，在小组讨论过程中或做思想小结、思想总结的过程中，找出存在的问题，经过适当的批评与自我批评，有领导、有步骤地来加以解决。这样使教学工作中结合学员思想实际和改造思想的任务得以顺利地实现。总之，必须有党的一系列的思想工作和组织工作的配合，才能使教学方针成为教学工作人员和学员的群众的行动，并使之得到正确的贯彻。
  三、哲学教学的收获
    根据以上的任务、方针、方法和步骤进行哲学教学的结果，收到了一定的成绩。这首先是打破了学员们对于哲学的神秘观点和各种错误看法，普遍地认为哲学是“可以学，而且必须学”的东西。学员们在学习后不仅了解了辩证唯物论和历史唯物论的基本的理论原理，而且开始领会到它的实际意义。例如在学习了唯物论单元后，能够根据思维和存在的关系的原理来划清唯物论和唯心论的界限，而且能够领会到在我们从事实际工作和解决实际问题的时候为什么必须“从实际出发”，必须首先注意“调查研究”，必须做到主观与客观相一致。许多同志根据唯物论原理检查了自己过去在土地改革，革命战争，城市工作中所犯的错误，懂得了错误的思想方法根源就在于违反了唯物论的认识论的原理，违反了反映论的原理，使主观与客观相分裂，因而陷入了主观主义的盲目性的缘故。一个小组这样总结过：“从实际出发的口号，对这些同志并不是生疏的，但大家并没有真正知道怎样才是从实际出发，不懂得这里包含着马克思列宁主义哲学的根本原理。这次大家都认识到，要克服主观主义的思想方法，就必须有明确的唯物主义的观点。”又如学习了辩证法的矛盾法则，学员们理解到这个法则的意义就是要求我们在研究问题和解决问题的时候，必须就事物的矛盾的各方面作全面的具体的分析，必须反对形而上学的片面性。于是就进而检讨了自己过去对许多实际问题——如党的总路线和党的具体政策的关系，新老干部的关系，老区工作和新区工作的关系，党和个人的关系，以及自己的优点和缺点，工作中的成功和失败的关系等等问题——的看法上的片面性。学习历史唯物论的结果，学员们对于生产是社会的物质基础，群众是创造历史的决定力量，阶级斗争是阶级社会发展的推动力，以及基础与上层建筑、社会存在与社会意识的正确关系等问题，都获得了一个较有系统的了解，并解决了自己工作中的许多实际问题，特别是普遍地检讨了自己的过分重视个人英雄作用忽视群众力量的历史唯心论的观点。
    从以上的例子可以看出，学习哲学使学员们的马克思列宁主义的水平大大提高了一步，而这水平提高的一个最显著的标志，就是学习哲学后他们阅读经典著作特别是毛泽东同志的著作的领会能力和兴趣显著地增加了，对于党的路线、政策等等的了解比以前深刻多了，都能提高到马克思列宁主义的哲学原则上来理解，因此学习理论的兴趣和信心都大大加强了。他们说，“现在读毛主席的著作，觉得字里行间，辩证唯物论与历史唯物论的精神在我们的眼前跳跃着”；“过去对党的政策是知其然而不知其所以然的，这就是我们在工作中左右摇摆犯错误的根源，现在懂得了用马克思列宁主义哲学观点去观察社会历史，观察社会生活，进而了解党的政策的制订，都是以社会生产发展规律为基础的，这对今后工作中克服盲目性，提高政策性和思想水平，是非常重要的。”这些就是学习中具有代表性的反映。
    认识的提高和思想改造的效果是分不开的。学员们在学习哲学后思想作风上开始有了某些显著的变化，最主要的就是对待自己的缺点和错误表现了比以前更为虚心的和严肃的态度，相互间批评与自我批评随着学习的进程而逐步地、很自然地普遍开展起来，特别是在学了关于批评与自我批评是社会主义社会的发展的动力的原理时，批评与自我批评就获得了理论上的自觉的指导力量而更加开展。有的人这样写道：“改造自己的思想，首先要经过内心斗争，不能全靠外因。”学员们在过去曾受过党的教育，对于思想改造和批评与自我批评的重要意义是有相当理解的，但大家都认为从来没有像这次学习哲学那样从根本的思想基础上获得了最深刻的认识，几乎每班每组都有人不约而同地说：“像这样深刻的教育，在我参加革命以来还是第一次！”
    四、教学经验的几点主要的体会
    上面说过，我们的哲学教学对象，是我党为数众多的中级干部。他们具有相当的实际工作经验，却缺少比较系统的马克思列宁主义的理论武装，首先是没有自觉地掌握马克思列宁主义思想方法的武器。如果用毛泽东同志的“有的放矢”这个比喻来说明正确的马克思列宁主义学习方法，那么，对这些干部的哲学教学任务，主要的就是要把马克思列宁主义思想方法这一支“矢”交到他们手里，使他们学会用它来射中国革命实际（包括自己的工作和思想的实际）之“的”，使他们由一般地有些实际经验和一般地懂得一些党的工作原则的情况提高到能够自觉地应用辩证唯物论和历史唯物论原理来研究问题和解决问题的水平。问题就在于如何把这支“矢”交给他们去掌握，也就是如何从思想方法上提高这些干部。马克思列宁学院的哲学教学，初步地摸到了一些解决这个问题的经验，这些经验对一般的中级干部——也包括一些高级干部——应该说是普遍适用的。
    哲学教学方法的本质，就在于要贯彻理论密切联系实际的精神，就在于要全面地掌握“学习理论，提高认识，联系实际，改造思想”的方针。首先必须使我们的干部钻研一些经典著作，比较有系统地学习哲学理论，因为他们所缺少的主要就是这
  一个方面。然而要把书本上的理论真正变为干部自己所能掌握的东西，专靠死读书本或讲授一般原理是不大容易达到目的的。为达到这个目的，最有效的入门方法，就是依据我党整风学习的经验，使学员用书本上和教员讲授中所学得的原理检查自己的工作经验和思想作风。这对于有些工作经验的干部们，做起来比较便利。不“学习理论，提高认识”，就没有“矢”，就谈不上学习马克思列宁主义，不“联系实际，改造思想”，不把“矢”对准一定的“的”来放射，就不可能体验到“矢”的作用，就不可能真正提高认识，领会马克思列宁主义的精神实质。所以，哲学教学方法必须是引导着学员注意到要边学边用，边钻研理论原则，边考虑到它的实际意义。而不应把学习理论和联系实际在学习过程上截然分开。自然，这并不是说上述十六个字方针的各个方面在任何时候都是要平均地同时出现，在学习过程的不同阶段，着重地掌握整个方针的某一个方面，这是容许的，也是应该的。例如在听讲、阅读的时候侧重理论内容的钻研，在做学习小结或总结的时候，侧重联系实际，特别是检查自己的工作和思想。但是，在着重钻研理论原则的时候，就必须适当地注意考虑到每一理论原则在我们生活中、工作中的实际意义，以避免对理论原则陷于教条主义的空洞了解，在着重检查自己的工作和思想实际的时候，又必须随时注意到理论原则的指导，以避免陷于狭隘经验主义的工作漫谈。
    所谓实际，决不能狭隘地看作只是个人的直接经验。我们把检查个人的工作和思想作为理论联系实际的中心环节，是因为这是学习哲学以及一般马克思列宁主义理论的有效的入门方法，是因为不如此就不容易把理论原理变成自己真正能够亲切领会的东西，决不是说这已是全部的方法。通过了这个入门方法，我们就要引导学员联系更广泛的实际——自然科学的实际，生产的实际，阶级斗争的实际等等，来加深学员们对于辩证唯物论和历史唯物论之作为马克思列宁主义的科学方法的理解。所以在教学过程中，必须适当地用自然界的，社会历史方面的，国际国内阶级斗争的以及党的政策路线的知识来丰富学习的内容，而尤其要以从马克思列宁主义思想方法的基础上来领会党的政策、路线、特别是党在过渡时期的总路线总任务、党的七届四中全会的决议等等作为全部哲学教学的重点和归宿。正因为这样，在我们的哲学课程教学全部结束了以后，我们还不能说是哲学的学习从此就告终了，在转入其他的课程（如联共（布）党史，中共党史等）的学习后，我们还要启发学员们继续运用哲学学习所获得的方法武器来领会这些课程的内容，并通过这些课程的学习来不断加深和提高自己对于马克思列宁主义哲学——科学的思想方法的认识。
    我们几个班的教学经验都证明了，执行上述理论与实际联系的方针，是必然要遭到各种不同程度的非马克思列宁主义的思想抵抗的，所以，在教学过程中如果不设法引导学员们开展批评与自我批评，学习是难于前进的。必须正确地掌握批评与自我批评的武器使之作为实现思想改造和推动学习前进的动力。我们的哲学教学是从最初的动员启发报告，讲课，辅导，讨论，直到最后进行思想总结，都不断地进行了必要的适当的思想斗争。作为教学方法的思想斗争，应该依据着这样的原则：即把坚持严肃的批评与自我批评和注意批评中的实事求是的态度这两个方面结合起来。即一方面坚决反对自由主义，一方面要适当地防止生硬过火的斗争。这两方面的结合又要随着学习的发展和学员思想情况的变化而有所侧重。就我们几个班的经验来说，在学习辩证唯物论单元以前，是比较侧重于反对自由主义以启发批评与自我批评的开展。当批评与自我批评已经普遍开展，自由主义的倾向基本上已被克服了时，一般是在学习历史唯物论单元时，特别是在最后做思想总结时，就要注意适当地防止生硬过火的斗争。
    要保证哲学教学任务的顺利完成，教学组织方面的集体领导是必不可少的条件。这主要应该注意下面的几点：一、教员对于所讲授的内容一方面必须个人负责充分准备，另一方面讲稿必须经过集体审查，至少某些重要问题的解释特别是新的问题的解答，必须经过集体的讨论。必须反对教学工作中的个人主义和分散主义，反对个人自以为是地任意发表意见，以便尽可能地避免讲授方面的错误，或同一问题在不同教员中间讲法不一致，使学员无所适从。二、教员、辅导员与同学——特别是与支部、班和组的骨干分子必须密切联系，以便了解同学的历史、思想情况和学习发展情况，使讲授和辅导内容能够针对学员的思想实际，充分贯彻联系实际改造思想的方针。这里要反对脱离学员群众的教学上的官僚主义。三、必须组织学员中间的集体互助，这是在教员少，学员多，班次多的情形下辅助教学力量不足的一个重要方法。学员中的互助应包含阅读的技术问题（如因某些名词概念的不了解和某些自然、历史常识的缺乏而发生的技术困难）上的互助，理论原则的领会方面的互助，而特别要着重思想方面的互助，在进行学习小结或总结，进行检查自己工作和思想时的互助。就这样的意义来说，相互批评也应该看做是一种互助的形式。
    最后要再提一遍：要保证哲学教学任务的顺利完成，必须有党的一系列的思想工作和组织工作的配合，必须有党对于教学工作人员的工作和对于学员的学习的监督和保证。理由在前面已说过，这里不再讲了。
