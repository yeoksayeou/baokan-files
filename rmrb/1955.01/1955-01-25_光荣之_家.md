    The Glorious "Home"
    By Our Reporter Sun Zunian
    In the middle section of Stone Street in the heroic city of Nanchang, the door of an old house is plastered with military family honor plaques and merit commendations. Those who pass by for the first time invariably cast a respectful glance, unanimously saying, "So many people from this family have joined the army, how glorious!"
    Before the Spring Festival, I visited this glorious "home". This is a hemp mill composed of more than seventy families of revolutionary martyrs and military dependents. The factory mainly produces hemp cloth, which is directly supplied to the Jiangxi Textile Factory for yarn wrapping needs. The martyrs' families and military dependents working in the factory are mostly poor women from families with employment difficulties. In the past, they could not find suitable work and could only rely on government relief to make a living. Since joining the factory for production, they have been working while studying culture, and now they have all mastered certain production skills. Old women in their fifties and sixties can also do reeling and bobbin work. Those who can weave can earn more than 400,000 yuan per month, and those doing light reeling work can also earn more than 200,000 yuan per month. Now they not only do not need government relief, but also have spare money to help their families solve their living difficulties.
    Working in this factory are relatives of martyrs who sacrificed in the revolutionary war, as well as mothers and wives of volunteers and People's Liberation Army comrades guarding the motherland's coast and borders. In production, they have carried forward the revolutionary tradition and overcome various difficulties. They, mothers and sons, and couples, often communicate and encourage each other, responding to the call of the motherland with practical actions in different positions.

    光荣之“家”
    本报记者　孙祖年
    在英雄城市——南昌石头街中段，一座古老屋子的门前贴满了军属光荣牌和立功喜报，初经过这里的人总要带着敬仰的眼光望一望，不约而同的说出：“这户人家这么多人参军，多么光荣啊！”
    春节前夕，我访问了这户光荣之“家”。这是一个由七十多户革命烈属、军属组成的麻布厂。这个厂主要是生产麻布，直接供应江西纺织厂包纱的需要。在厂里工作的烈属、军属，大多是较为贫苦而就业困难的家庭妇女。她们过去找不到适当的工作，只有依靠政府救济过生活，自到厂参加生产后，一边工作，一边学习文化，现在都已掌握着一定的生产技术。五、六十岁的老婆婆，也能做摇纱、打筒工作。会织布的每月可得到四十多万元，轻便的摇纱工每月也能得二十多万元的收入。现在她们不但不需要政府救济，而且还有余钱帮助家庭解决生活困难。
    在这个厂里工作的，有在革命战争中牺牲的烈士们的亲人，有志愿军和守卫在祖国海防、边防上的解放军同志们的母亲和妻子。在生产中她们发扬了革命传统，克服了各种困难，她（他）们母子，夫妇之间，经常通信互相鼓励，在不同的岗位上以实际行动响应祖国的号召。
