    The Chinese People's Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe has concluded its performances and visits in the Soviet Union and arrived at the Soviet eastern border town of Otpor on January 2nd.

    In the month and a half since entering Soviet territory on November 18th, the Song and Dance Troupe performed a total of 42 shows in ten cities including Minsk, Kyiv, Kharkiv, Leningrad, Moscow, Stalingrad, Sverdlovsk, Novosibirsk, Irkutsk, and Chita, with approximately 60,000 viewers. In addition, there were television broadcasts in Kyiv, Leningrad, and Moscow, with 4 million viewers. The Moscow Radio broadcast of the programs performed by the Song and Dance Troupe to the entire country aroused strong interest among the Soviet people and army. They unanimously believed that "the visit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe to the Soviet Union is a major event in the political and cultural life of the Soviet people." They also believed that the artistic direction of the Song and Dance Troupe was correct, and that the nationality, combativeness, and diversity of performance forms in the programs truly reflected the struggle and life of the Chinese people and their army.

    During the troupe's tour, at each of the larger train stations they passed through, many citizens braved the wind and snow to go to the platform to play music to welcome them and present gifts. The members of the Song and Dance Troupe danced and celebrated with them on the platform.

    In the month and a half, in addition to performing in the Soviet Union, the Song and Dance Troupe also visited the great construction projects of the Soviet people. They visited more than twenty large-scale factories, hydropower stations, collective farms, and expanded new urban areas. In Moscow, they paid homage to the mausoleums of the great Lenin and Stalin and paid their respects to their remains. In addition, the members of the Song and Dance Troupe met with the great artists of the entire Soviet Union and the Byelorussian, Ukrainian, and Russian republics. They watched their song and dance drama performances more than ten times. Many cordial symposiums, studies, and visits were held. The performance, study, and visit of the Song and Dance Troupe in the Soviet Union this time left an extremely deep and good impression on the Soviet people. Before they left Moscow, the Soviet Ministry of Culture held a farewell banquet and gave the Song and Dance Troupe a complete set of theater lighting equipment. Even when they returned home and arrived at the border, they continued to receive congratulatory and thank-you telegrams and letters from people and troops from all over the Soviet Union.
