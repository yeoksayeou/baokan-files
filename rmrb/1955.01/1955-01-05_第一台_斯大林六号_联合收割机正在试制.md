    The work of trial-producing the "Stalin-6" combine harvester for the first time in our country has begun at the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory. As of January 3 this year, workers in the trial production workshop had successfully trial-produced 107 parts. They plan to successfully trial-produce the first machine by April 15 as a gift for the "May Day" International Labor Day.

    The "Stalin-6" combine harvester has a very complex structure. It has more than 24,000 parts, weighing more than seven tons. This machine is very efficient. It plows the land by traction. In the Soviet Union, it can plow 400 mu of land per day, with a plowing depth of up to nine inches.

    Before the trial production, the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, led by the chief engineer, organized a process group with veteran technicians, engineers, and technical personnel to conduct surveying and mapping of drawings, verifying drawings and samples. They learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and the efficiency of design and proofreading work increased by 25%, and the efficiency of drawing increased by one time. The workers of Wang Huisheng's model group in the trial production workshop adopted the assembly line operation method, which greatly improved work efficiency. Since the beginning of the trial production, the Tang Wenhai fitter group has completed each part ahead of schedule.

    第一台“斯大林六号”联合收割机正在试制
    我国第一次试制“斯大林六号”联合收割机的工作，已经在北京农业机械厂开始进行。到今年一月三日，试制车间的工人已试制成功一百零七个零件。他们计划在四月十五日试制成功第一台，作为向“五一”国际劳动节的献礼。
    “斯大林六号”联合收割机构造非常复杂。它的零件共有两万四千多件，重七吨多。这种机器工作效率很高。它牵引着犁耕地，在苏联一天可耕四百亩地，耕深可达到九寸。
    在试制前，北京农业机械厂由总工程师领导，吸收老技术工人、工程师、技术人员共同组织了一个工艺组，进行测绘图样、验对图纸和样品。他们学习了苏联的先进经验，设计校对工作提高效率百分之二十五，描图提高了一倍。试制车间王惠生模型小组的工人，采用流水作业法，大大提高了工作效率。唐文海钳工小组，从试制开始，每个零件都提前完工。
