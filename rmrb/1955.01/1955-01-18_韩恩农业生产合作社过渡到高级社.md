Han'en Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, after a long period of preparation, has transitioned to an agricultural producers' cooperative of a completely socialist nature. On January 10, the cooperative held an advanced cooperative establishment meeting. At the establishment meeting, all members unanimously agreed to name it the "Road to Happiness" Agricultural Producers' Cooperative. Han'en reported on the development of the cooperative over the past few years and the specific conditions for the transition. The meeting also announced the "Road to Happiness" Agricultural Producers' Cooperative's 1955 production plan and its development plan up to 1957. According to this plan, by 1957, the entire cooperative will expand to 250 households with 420 hectares of land (currently 145 households with 265 hectares of land), and the total grain output will reach more than 3.4 million jin. In addition to the grain consumed by members and the grain paid to the state, 1.7 million jin of surplus grain can be sold to the state. With the development of production, a large conference room, nursery, bathhouse, and health clinic will all be established in the cooperative by 1957.

At the end of the meeting, a letter to Chairman Mao was unanimously adopted, reporting to the beloved leader on the new achievements they had made in the cooperative movement, stating that they would follow the path indicated by the Party, work hard to increase production, increase grain output, and support national construction.

    韩恩农业生产合作社过渡到高级社
    吉林省蛟河县韩恩农业生产合作社，经过长期准备，已过渡到完全社会主义性质的农业生产合作社。一月十日该社举行了高级社成立大会，在成立大会上，全体社员一致同意命名为“幸福之路”农业生产合作社。韩恩在会上报告了几年来合作社的发展情况和转社的具体条件。会上并宣布了“幸福之路”农业生产合作社一九五五年生产计划和到一九五七年的发展计划。按着这个计划，全社到一九五七年将扩大到二百五十户，土地四百二十垧，（现在是一百四十五户，二百六十五垧土地）粮食总产量可达到三百四十多万斤。除了社员吃用和缴纳公粮以外，可卖给国家余粮一百七十万斤。随着生产的发展，社内大型会议室、托儿所、澡塘、卫生所等都将在一九五七年建立起来。
    大会最后一致通过了给毛主席的信，向敬爱的领袖报告他们在合作化运动中所获得的新成就，表示：要遵循党所指示的道路，努力提高生产，增加粮食产量，支援国家建设。
