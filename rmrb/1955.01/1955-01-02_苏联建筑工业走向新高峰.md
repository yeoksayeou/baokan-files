    Soviet Architectural Industry Reaches New Heights
    By Our Correspondent Li He

    The representatives of construction workers across the Soviet Union recently held an important meeting in Moscow. After the meeting, they issued a call to all Soviet construction workers to further develop the construction industry. The Soviet construction industry is heading towards a new peak.

    The Soviet Construction Workers Conference, convened by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, was held in the Kremlin from November 30th to December 7th. Two thousand two hundred people from all over the Soviet Union participated in the meeting, including construction workers, engineers, technicians, architects, and staff from building materials industry, building machinery and road construction machinery manufacturing, design institutions, and scientific research institutions. The leaders of the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union participated in the meeting from beginning to end. Ministers and other responsible persons from various departments of the construction industry made reports to the conference. At the meeting, advanced personnel in the construction industry discussed major issues in the construction industry together with the leaders of the Party and the government. Three hundred and ninety-nine people spoke at the plenary sessions and group meetings. Many people submitted written opinions to the conference. At the end of the meeting, Comrade Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, delivered a lengthy speech. When discussing the reports, the participants of the conference did not rest on their laurels with their existing achievements, but concentrated their efforts on exposing and criticizing the shortcomings in their work, exchanging experiences, and formulating measures to improve the construction industry. Therefore, the gains of this conference are obviously very great. The All-Soviet Union Construction Workers Conference is one of a series of national conferences held in the Soviet Union this year, and it once again embodies the combination of the collective wisdom of the leadership and the masses.

    Under the care of the Party and the government, the Soviet construction industry has grown into a huge sector of the national economy. The Soviet Union has a strong construction force - construction workers, engineers and technicians; construction sites and building materials industry are equipped with many machines and mechanical equipment. Based on this, the contribution of Soviet builders to strengthening the strength of socialist countries and improving the people's living standards is indeed huge. You can see this from the scale of Soviet capital construction since the war. In the years since the war, the Soviet Union has invested more than 900 billion rubles in capital construction; more than 8,000 large industrial enterprises have been restored and newly built; more than 200 million square meters of housing have been built in cities and workers' residential areas, and about 4.5 million houses have been built in rural areas; many schools, hospitals, kindergartens, nurseries, tractor stations, state farms, and collective farm production buildings have been built. The volume of construction and installation work in 1954 increased to two and a half times that of 1946. However, with the continuous rise of heavy industry and the entire national economy, the scale of Soviet construction is expanding day by day. The Fifth Five-Year Plan is being completed ahead of schedule. Large hydropower stations, coal mines and other heavy industrial enterprises are continuing to be built, railway lines and highways are being added, and housing and cultural life facilities are being expanded. Recently, in rural areas, especially in newly reclaimed areas, the amount of construction work is increasing. In the consumer goods industry and commerce, the need for construction is also increasing. Therefore, Soviet builders are not complacent about the past achievements of the construction industry, but strive to meet the needs of objective development now and in the future.

    Shortening the construction period, using buildings on schedule, reducing construction costs, and improving construction quality - these are the main tasks that the conference participants put forward to the construction workers across the Soviet Union. To this end, Soviet builders will rapidly implement the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers on developing the production of precast reinforced concrete structures and parts. This is to universally adopt industrialized construction methods - using precast structures and parts made in factories, turning construction sites into assembly sites, and building according to standard designs. They will more fully explore and use the potential forces in construction organizations and enterprises, and will promote scientific achievements and advanced experience in construction, including the use of scientific achievements in foreign construction.

    This All-Soviet Union Construction Workers Conference pointed out that the use of precast reinforced concrete structures can greatly save steel and wood, reduce labor and construction time. The experience of construction workers in Leningrad, Rostov and other places shows that an installation worker only spends fifteen minutes to build a piece of reinforced concrete fittings, which replaces about eight hundred bricks, which requires a bricklayer's day's work. The Magnitogorsk Construction Trust used large reinforced concrete wall panels to build many four-story buildings, shortening the construction period by four months. The Moscow Cultural Construction Office used large reinforced concrete fittings to build schools, saving 30 percent of labor per cubic meter compared with brick construction.

    In order to ensure the widespread use of precast reinforced concrete structures and parts, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers decided to build 402 manufacturing plants and 200 experimental plants in three years, so as to increase the production of such reinforced concrete structures and parts five times, so that by 1957, 9.8 million cubic meters of such products will be produced annually. Workers in the construction and building materials industries will rapidly build and put these factories into operation.

    The All-Soviet Construction Workers Conference called on all construction workers to fully use the technical equipment at the construction site and strive for the comprehensive mechanization of the construction process, especially heavy and laborious work. They called for: improving labor productivity, resolutely improving the organization of construction production, and persistently promoting advanced experience. This conference pointed out that construction organizations must reserve necessary materials before the end of the year so that they can work as usual in winter in order to ensure that the work is carried out evenly throughout the year; small construction organizations must be merged into large construction organizations that can better increase production, save costs, and complete plans; the specialization of construction organizations must be developed in order to improve labor productivity, better use machines, and improve work quality.

    The conference emphasized an important experience in capital construction: it is necessary to eliminate the incorrect practice of dispersedly using forces and funds on numerous goals, and to concentrate resources on completing the started goals, especially the goals that will be completed, and reduce the amount of unfinished construction.

    Further industrialization of construction requires improvement of design work. The conference pointed out that it is necessary to ensure that the project has excellent designs and budgets in a timely manner, it is necessary to resolutely turn to standard designs and repeated designs, and it is necessary to widely adopt standardized and standardized structures and parts, and it is absolutely not allowed to be too extravagant in design. The conference severely and correctly criticized many architects, criticizing them for making serious mistakes of wasting people's wealth in the practice of construction. When designing residential and public buildings, many architects do not pay much attention to the economy and internal arrangement of the house, do not consider whether the living of workers is comfortable, but too extravagantly decorate the exterior, pursue the beauty of form, and ignore the industrialized construction technology conditions. The conference called on architects to innovate their work, improve the quality of design work, pay special attention to the economy of the designed buildings, and create comfortable conditions for homes, schools, hospitals, nurseries, and clubs.

    The conference pointed out that the fundamental improvement of the entire construction industry is first determined by people, determined by people's ability, creative spirit, and talent. It is necessary to universally improve the work of training construction cadres, pay more attention to them, maximize the role of group leaders and foremen on construction sites, and strengthen the production of construction with specialized cadres.

    The All-Soviet Union Construction Workers Conference once again shows that under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people are paying the greatest attention to further developing heavy industry, because heavy industry is the foundation for developing the socialist economy and consolidating national defense.

    苏联建筑工业走向新高峰
    本报记者　李何
    苏联全国建筑工作者的代表，最近在莫斯科举行了重要的会议。会后，他们向全苏联建筑工作者发出了进一步发展建筑工业的号召。苏联建筑工业在走向新的高峰。
    由苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议召开的苏联建筑工作者会议，在克里姆林宫从十一月三十日开到十二月七日。全苏联各地来参加会议的有二千二百人，包括建筑工人、工程师、技师和建筑师，以及建筑材料工业、建筑机器和筑路机器制造业、设计机关和科学研究机关的工作人员。苏联共产党和政府的领导人员自始至终参加了会议。建筑工业各部部长和其他负责人都向大会作了报告。在会议上，建筑工业的先进人员同党和政府的领导人员一起讨论了建筑工业上的重大问题。三百九十九个人在全体会议和分组会议上发了言。许多人向会议提出了书面意见。在会议结束时，苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫同志发表了长篇演说。在讨论报告的时候，会议的参加者不以已有的成就自满，都集中力量来揭露和批评工作中的缺点，交换经验和制订提高建筑工业的措施。因此，这次会议的收获显然是很大的。全苏联建筑工作者会议是这一年来苏联一系列全国性会议之一，它又一次体现了领导和群众的集体智慧的结合。
    苏联的建筑工业，在党和政府的关怀之下，已成长为国民经济的巨大部门。苏联拥有强大的建筑者——建筑工人，工程师和技师的队伍；工地和建筑材料工业装备着许多机器和机械。在这个基础上，苏联建筑者对于加强社会主义国家的力量和提高人民的生活水平的贡献，的确是巨大的。从战后苏联基本建设的规模，你就可以看到了。战后这几年中，苏联投在基本建设的资金超过九千亿卢布；恢复和新建了八千多个大工业企业；在城市和工人住区盖了面积二亿平方公尺以上的住宅，在乡村盖了约四百五十万幢房屋；盖了许多学校、医院、幼儿园、托儿所、拖拉机站、国营农场和集体农庄的生产建筑物。一九五四年的建筑和安装工作量，增长为一九四六年的二倍半。但是随着重工业和全部国民经济的不断高涨，苏联的建筑规模在一天天扩大中。第五个五年计划在提前完成着。大水电站、煤矿及其他重工业企业在继续建筑，铁路公路线在增设，住宅和文化生活场所在扩建。最近以来，在农村，特别是新开垦区，建筑工作量在增长着。在日用品工业和商业方面，建筑的需要也增加着。因此，苏联建筑者不自满于建筑工业过去的成绩，而力求满足现在和将来客观发展的需要。
    缩短建筑期限，克期使用建筑物，降低建筑成本，改进建筑质量——这是会议参加者向苏联全国建筑工作者提出的主要任务。为此，苏联建筑者将迅速地执行苏联共产党中央和苏联部长会议关于发展供装配的钢筋混凝土的结构和零件的生产的决定。这就是要普遍地采用工业化建筑方法——采用在工厂里做好的供装配的结构和零件，把工地变成装配的场所，按照标准的设计建筑。他们将更充分地发掘和使用在建筑组织中和企业中的潜在力量，将推广建筑中的科学成就和先进经验，包括利用外国建筑中的科学成就。
    这次全苏联建筑者会议指出：采用供装配的钢筋混凝土的结构，可以大大节约钢材和木材，缩减劳动量和建筑期限。列宁格勒、罗斯托夫等处的建筑工人的经验表明：一个安装工人只花十五分钟砌一块钢筋混凝土的配件，它约代替八百块砖，那需要砌砖工人一天的工作。马格尼托高尔斯克建筑托拉斯用大块钢筋混凝土的壁板盖许多四层楼房，缩短了四个月建筑期限。莫斯科文化建筑处用大块钢筋混凝土的配件建筑学校，比起用砖建筑，每立方公尺节省百分之三十劳动量。
    为了保证广泛地采用供装配的钢筋混凝土的结构和零件，苏联共产党中央和苏联部长会议决定在三年中建设四百零二座制造厂和二百座实验厂，以便提高这种钢筋混凝土的结构和零件的生产五倍，使得到一九五七年一年出产九百八十万立方公尺这种产品。建筑和建筑材料工业的工作者将迅速地建筑和动用这些工厂。
    这次所召开的全苏建筑者会议号召全体建筑工作者充分地使用在工地的技术设备，争取建筑过程首先是沉重的费力的工作全盘的机械化。他们号召：提高劳动生产率，坚决地改善建筑生产的组织，坚持地推广先进经验。这次会议指出：建筑组织必须在年前储备好必要的材料，使冬季照常工作，才能保证工作周年均衡地进行；必须把小的建筑组织合并成能更好地增产节约和完成计划的大的建筑组织；必须发展建筑组织的专业化，以便提高劳动生产率、更好地使用机器和改进工作质量。
    会议强调基本建设中一条重要的经验：应当杜绝那种把力量和资金分散地使用在众多目标上的不正确的做法，应当把资力集中在完成已开工的目标，特别是将完工的目标，减少未完成的建筑量。
    建筑的进一步工业化，要求改善设计工作。会议指出：必须及时地保证工程有优良的设计和预算，必须坚决地转向标准的设计和重复的设计，必须广泛地采用典型化和标准化的结构和零件，绝不允许在设计上太过奢侈。会议严厉而正确地批评了许多建筑师，批评他们在建筑的实践中犯了浪费人民资财的严重错误。在设计居住和公共建筑物的时候，许多建筑师不大注意房屋的经济和内部的安排，不考虑劳动者居住是否舒适，而太过奢侈地装饰外表，追求形式的美观，并且不顾工业化的建筑技术条件。会议号召建筑师革新自己的工作，改进设计工作的质量，特别注意所设计的建筑物的经济，和为住宅、学校、医院、托儿所、俱乐部创造舒适的条件。
    会议指出：全部建筑事业的根本改进，首先决定于人，决定于人的能力，创造精神和才干。必须普遍地改进培养建筑干部的工作，更大关心他们，尽量提高工地上组长和工长的作用，以专门的干部加强建筑的生产。
    全苏联建筑工作者会议又一次说明：苏联人民在苏联共产党的领导之下，以最大的注意力进一步发展着重工业，因为重工业是发展社会主义经济和巩固国防的基础。
    十二月十九日
