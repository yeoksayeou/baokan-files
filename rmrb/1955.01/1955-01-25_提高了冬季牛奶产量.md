    Increased Winter Milk Production
    The Shahekou Milk Production Team of the Lüda No. 1 Farm constantly supplies fresh milk to eight larger state-owned factories and mines, two government agencies, and four nurseries, serving a total of more than 3,000 people.
    In order to eliminate the past phenomenon of reduced milk production every winter, and to ensure normal or increased milk production even in the cold winter, the team prepared the storage of winter feed as early as last autumn. They stored more than 40,000 catties of green buried feed and tens of thousands of catties of succulent feed (radishes, carrots, sweet potatoes, etc.). After entering winter, they give the dairy cows a certain amount of succulent feed every day, and adopted the advanced Soviet experience of using hot water to soak dry grass to make dry grass tea for the cows to drink. In this way, milk production has not only not decreased, but has also increased. The team has seventy-two dairy cows (excluding thirty-six non-lactating pregnant cows and young cows), which can produce 1,850 catties of milk per day, an increase of 10 percent compared to the past.

    提高了冬季牛奶产量
    旅大第一农场沙河口奶牛生产队，常年不断地供应着八个较大的国营厂矿企业、两个机关、四个托儿所共三千余人的食用鲜牛奶。
    该队为消除过去每到冬季牛奶减产的现象，保证在寒冬里也能照常产奶或多产奶，早在去秋就做好了冬季饲料的贮藏工作，共贮藏了四万余斤青埋饲料和数万斤多汁饲料（大萝卜、葫萝卜、地瓜等）。入冬后，他们每天都给奶牛一定数量的多汁饲料吃，并采取了苏联的先进经验，用热水泡干草制成干草茶给牛喝，这样，牛奶产量不仅未减少还有了增加。该队有七十二头奶牛（三十六头不出奶的妊娠牛和育成牛不包括在内），每天可产奶一千八百五十斤，比过去提高了百分之十。
