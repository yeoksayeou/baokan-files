    Recently, large contiguous plots of farmland have appeared on the western Sichuan Plain. These fields all belong to agricultural producers' cooperatives.

    Zhou Guilin, the director of the Hongguang Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Pi County, told reporters about the transformation of land from small plots to large ones. He said, "In the past, people regarded land as their lifeline, but now this idea has changed. Now, mentioning whose land it is only happens within the cooperative when assigning work or inspecting production for identification purposes. Last autumn, the 185 mu of land that the cooperative had cultivated by the agricultural machinery tractor station were simply numbered Machine-Cultivated Field No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4. The cooperative members immediately adopted this terminology, and even the customary reference to 'so-and-so's land' was eliminated."

    The members of the Hongguang Cooperative also told a story about the past, when people invariably fought over land. The story goes that before joining the cooperative, Aunt Zhang and Xiong Ziliang were neighbors with adjacent fields and often quarreled over the field ridges. Xiong Ziliang said that Aunt Zhang should not plant soybeans on the ridge because they would block the sunlight to his rice paddy. Aunt Zhang retorted that Xiong Ziliang had trimmed too much of the ridge, damaging her roots. In the first half of the year before last, the two families even fought over a few clumps of dirt. After joining the cooperative, their thinking improved, their income increased, and they happily worked together in the same production team, no longer finding fault with each other.

    Since its establishment in the winter of the year before last, the Hongguang Cooperative has removed more than 200 field ridges and 23 irrigation ditches, creating four large fields of about 50 mu each, increasing the cultivated area by about 15 mu. Recently, the cooperative has planned to remove all other field ridges and small ditches that should be removed this year in order to expand the planting area and increase income.

### 川西平原出现许多连成大片的农田

    川西平原出现许多连成大片的农田
    最近，川西平原上出现了连成大块的庄稼地，这些地都是农业生产合作社的。
    郫县红光农业生产合作社社长周桂林，向记者述说了土地由小到大的变迁，他说：“过去人们把田地当命根子，现在这种想法已经改变了。现在说谁家的田地，只有在社内调工和检查生产时，为了识别才提到。去年秋耕，社里由农业机器拖拉机站代耕的一百八十五亩田，当时编为机耕田一号、二号、三号、四号，社员们马上就叫开了，连称呼那是某人的田地的说法也取消了。”
    红光社的社员还讲了过去一个“对土必争”的故事，这故事是：未入社前张二婶和熊自良是田邻，经常为田坎争吵不和。熊自良说张二婶田坎上不应种豆子，遮住了他田里的稻子；张二婶说熊自良把田坎铲多了，伤了他的根子。前年上半年两家还为几块泥土争得打起架来。入社后，两家思想提高了，收益增加了，欢欢喜喜在一个生产队里干活，再也不说你长我短了。
    红光社自前年冬天建社到现在，已经除掉了二百多个田坎和二十三个灌田的水沟，连成五十亩左右的大田就有四块，增加耕地面积十五亩上下。最近，社内又计划在今年内把其他应该除掉的田坎小沟统统搞掉，以便扩大种植面积，增加收益。
