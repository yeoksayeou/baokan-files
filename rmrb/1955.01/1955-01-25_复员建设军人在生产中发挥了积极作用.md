Demobilized and reassigned soldiers participating in industrial and agricultural production and various other jobs are maintaining the fine traditions of the People's Army and playing an active role.

Most of the demobilized and reassigned soldiers settled in rural areas are actively participating in agricultural production. According to statistics from some areas of Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Liaoning, and Jilin provinces, 80 to 90 percent of the demobilized and reassigned soldiers have joined mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Since returning to his hometown in 1952, Wei Shumin, a demobilized and reassigned soldier from Yishan County, Guangxi Province, took the lead in organizing a mutual aid team. In 1953, he took the lead in organizing an agricultural production cooperative and was elected as the deputy director and a county-level labor model. In 1954, the entire cooperative increased production by 36 percent and expanded from 23 households to 230 households. After returning to his hometown, Chen Lixin, a demobilized and reassigned soldier from Chuansha County, Jiangsu Province, actively mobilized the masses to participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations and led the masses in reclaiming more than 2,000 mu of wasteland. Liu Saille, a demobilized and reassigned soldier from Chaoyang County, Guangdong Province, was selected as a national rice bumper harvest model because of his active production. Among the demobilized and reassigned soldiers, many have become the backbone of local agricultural production.

Demobilized and reassigned soldiers settled in urban industrial and mining enterprises and other departments generally strive to study their professions diligently and learn humbly. Many have already achieved remarkable results. Among the 70 demobilized and reassigned soldiers at the Qingdao State-owned Rubber General Factory, more than 95 percent have played an active role in production, and 30 percent have created excellent results. For example, Yu Wenzhang, a demobilized and reassigned soldier at the factory, improved his work methods and increased his output from 700 inner tube nozzles per day to 1,691.

The active efforts of demobilized soldiers in various job positions have earned the respect and love of the broad masses. Many of them have been elected as people's representatives or work models. According to statistics from 30 counties and cities in Jilin Province, as of October 1954, 3,097 demobilized and reassigned soldiers had been elected as representatives to local people's congresses at all levels, 3,455 had served as township and village cadres, 1,851 had been elected as various models, 4,470 had served as mutual aid team leaders, and 784 had served as agricultural production cooperative chairmen (directors). In the Jiaozhou area and Wenshang and Qufu counties of Shandong Province, demobilized and reassigned soldiers elected as township and village cadres accounted for 32 percent of the total number of demobilized and reassigned soldiers in the area and counties, and nine were elected as representatives to the provincial people's congress. The achievements of demobilized and reassigned soldiers in production and work have had a positive political impact among the people. For example, many workers in Harbin say that demobilized and reassigned soldiers are both literate and martial, and they do well wherever they are placed, truly worthy of being good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

    复员建设军人在生产中发挥了积极作用
    【本报讯】参加工农业生产和各项工作的复员建设军人，保持着人民军队的优良传统，发挥了积极的作用。
    安置在农村的复员建设军人，大多数都积极地参加了农业生产。据河北、山西、山东、辽宁、吉林等省部分地区的统计，参加互助合作组织的复员建设军人达到复员建设军人总数的百分之八十到九十。广西省宜山县复员建设军人韦舒敏，从一九五二年回乡时起，就带头组织互助组；一九五三年又带头组织农业生产合作社，被选为副社长和县劳动模范。一九五四年全社增产三成六，并由二十三户扩大到二百三十户。江苏省川沙县复员建设军人陈立新回乡后，积极发动群众参加互助合作组织，并领导群众开荒二千多亩。广东省潮阳县复员建设军人刘赛烈，由于他积极生产，被选为全国水稻丰产模范。复员建设军人之中，有许多人已经成为当地农业生产中的骨干。
    安置在城市工矿企业等部门的复员建设军人，一般都能努力钻研业务，虚心学习，许多人并已获得了显著成绩。青岛市国营橡胶总厂七十名复员建设军人中，有百分之九十五以上的人都在生产中发挥了积极作用，有百分之三十的人创造了优良成绩。如该厂复员建设军人于文章，由于改进了工作方法，从每天做七百个车内胎嘴提高到做一千六百九十一个。
    复员军人在各种不同的工作岗位上积极努力的结果，受到了广大群众的尊敬和爱戴。他们之中有不少人被选为人民代表或工作模范。据吉林省三十个县、市的统计，到一九五四年十月，复员建设军人被选为地方各级人民代表大会代表的有三千零九十七名，担任乡、村干部的有三千四百五十五名，被选为各种模范的有一千八百五十一名，担任互助组组长的有四千四百七十名，担任农业生产合作社社长（主任）的有七百八十四名。山东省胶州专区和汶上、曲阜两县被选为乡、村干部的复员建设军人，占该专区、县复员建设军人总数的百分之三十二，被选为省人民代表大会代表的有九人。复员建设军人在生产中和工作中所表现的成绩，在人民群众中发生了良好的政治影响。如哈尔滨的许多职工都说复员建设军人能文能武，放在那里那里行，真不愧是毛主席的好战士。
