Shaanxi Province afforested more than 210,000 mu in 1954, of which approximately 120,000 mu were protection forests. Winter afforestation work is currently continuing. After several years of management, sand-preventing forest belts along the Great Wall have seen the emergence of many green spots in the desert. In Hengshan, Yulin and other places, three forest lines, each more than sixty li long, have been formed. Some young forests are also about to connect. They have initially played a role in fixing sand, protecting fields, and protecting dikes. Crops have been replanted in a few of the forest networks that have grown up.

With the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, afforestation work has become more organized. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 4,800 mutual aid teams and cooperatives engaged in cooperative afforestation throughout the province, including more than 62,000 peasant households. The area of cooperative afforestation accounts for 67% of the total afforestation area.

    陕西省造林工作有成绩
      陕西省在一九五四年内共造林二十一万多亩，其中防护林约有十二万多亩，目前冬季造林工作尚在继续进行。长城沿线防沙林带，经几年经营，沙漠中已出现不少绿点。横山、榆林等地已连成三条长达六十里以上的林线。有的幼林也快连起来。初步起了固沙、护田、护堤作用。长起的少数林网中已经重新播种上庄稼。
    随着互助合作运动的开展，造林工作带有更大的组织性。据不完全统计，全省合作造林的互助组和合作社共有四千八百多个，包括六万二千多户农民。合作造林面积占造林总面积百分之六十七。
