Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 7th TASS dispatch: Gritchin published an article in "Pravda" entitled "What American Atomic Maniacs Should Not Forget."

Gritchin wrote: For several years, official spokesmen in Washington have been talking about the United States "monopolizing" the atomic bomb. Later, they began clamoring about their "advantage" in designing hydrogen bombs. However, in reality, the United States does not have a monopoly on atomic or hydrogen weapons. The Pentagon's generals are trying to use nuclear weapons to intimidate the people of other countries, but it is the people of their own country who are being intimidated.

In this situation, America's atomic peddlers are trying to salvage the situation by dragging out the "blitzkrieg" theory, once heavily promoted by the Hitlerites, from the cold storage. They are trying to convince their compatriots that American aircraft can carry out "lightning" attacks on targets in the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies without fear of retaliation.

Gritchin wrote: But overzealous American atomic maniacs would do well to remember that the Soviet Union has all the necessary means to defeat the aggressor. For example, as far as aircraft are concerned, those planning aerial provocations against the Soviet Union must be clearly aware of this.

In the past few years, American aircraft have repeatedly attempted to "probe" Soviet airspace. These attempts have been defeated by the glorious Soviet aviators. Let everyone know clearly that the Soviet Air Force will continue to vigilantly defend the Soviet borders. Some other recent facts are also worth recalling. Has the Pentagon forgotten its plans in the Korean War? These plans were to destroy North Korea from the air. To carry out these plans, the U.S. military command put a large air force into battle. But the newborn air force of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in close cooperation with anti-aircraft artillery, successfully crushed the American aircraft.

Gritchin wrote: Is there any doubt that the failure of the American air war plan in Korea is one of the reasons why the United States is now trying so hard to rearm West Germany and rebuild the German Wehrmacht as a tool for land warfare?

This fact alone is enough to show that American militarists, while clamoring for an atomic "blitzkrieg," have not been able to balance the debit and credit sides of the ledger.

Gritchin concluded: For the sake of peace and the security of all peoples, the Soviet Union has consistently advocated the prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, and has advocated disarmament. We have always been and continue to be in the cause of safeguarding peace. But those who have
  “atomic fever” would do well to realize that their “blitzkrieg” will only be the crackling sound of an electric spark.
    This is what the gentlemen suffering from atomic mania should never forget.

    美国原子狂者不应当忘记的事情
    ——“真理报”发表的格里钦中将的文章的摘要
     【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科七日讯：格里钦中将在“真理报”发表了一篇文章，题目是“美国原子狂者不应当忘记的事情”。
    格里钦写道：若干年来，华盛顿官方发言人一直在大谈美国“垄断”着原子弹。以后，他们开始叫嚣他们在设计氢弹方面占有“优势”。然而，实际上美国在原子武器和氢武器方面都没有垄断地位。五角大楼的将军们企图用核子武器来恐吓其他国家的人民，而被吓倒的却是他们自己国家的人民。
    在这种情况下，美国的原子贩子企图从冷藏库中搬出希特勒分子一度大事宣传的“闪电战”理论来“补救”这种局面。他们企图使他们的同胞相信，美国飞机能够对苏联和人民民主国家的目标进行“闪电式”的袭击而不怕受到还击。
    格里钦写道：但是过于热心的美国原子狂者最好记住苏联有一切必要的手段来击败侵略者。例如，就飞机而言，那些策划对苏联进行空中挑衅的人一定清楚地知道这一点。
    在过去几年中，美国飞机曾一再试图“探测”苏联的领空。这些尝试都被光荣的苏联飞行人员击败了。让每个人都清楚地知道吧，苏联空军将继续警惕地保卫苏联的边疆。最近的另外一些事实也值得追述一下。五角大楼难道忘记了美国在朝鲜战争中的计划了吗？这些计划就是要从空中摧毁北朝鲜。为了执行这些计划，美军司令部把一支庞大的空军投入战斗。但是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的新生空军在和高射炮密切配合下，成功地打垮了美国飞机。
    格里钦写道：美国在朝鲜进行空战的计划的失败，正是美国现在一味设法重新武装西德和重建德国国防军作为进行陆战的工具的原因之一，难道这还有疑问吗？
    单单这个事实就足以表明：美国军国主义者在叫嚣原子“闪电战”的同时，并没有能够把账本上的收支两方平衡起来。
    格里钦最后写道：为了和平和各国人民的安全，苏联一贯坚持不渝地赞成禁止原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器，赞成裁减军备。我们一向并且继续在维护和平事业。但是那些发
  “原子热”的人最好认识到：他们的“闪电战”一定只不过是电火的噼啪一下的声响而已。
    这是患原子狂的先生们决不应当忘记的。
