    Which Road to Take After All
    Zhong Xia
    The CPC Committee of the Karaqin Banner in Rehe Province inspected the work of the "Hongzhuang" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Liangjianfang Village during the autumn harvest distribution and found that the cooperative had serious capitalist tendencies.

    The "Hongzhuang" Agricultural Production Cooperative was established in the spring of 1954, with a total of twelve households, including two well-to-do middle-peasant households, three middle-peasant households, and seven poor-peasant households. When the cooperative was established, the leading cadres were not carefully selected, and the leadership was manipulated by two well-to-do middle-peasant households with serious capitalist ideas, so that the semi-socialist agricultural production cooperative did not advance along the socialist road.

    Over the past year, this cooperative has had the following facts that show a tendency towards capitalism:

    1.  Concealing land and underreporting output in an attempt to pay less public grain and evade grain purchases. When the cooperative was established, the actual measured land was 496.56 mu, but only 408 mu were reported; the total grain output should have been 111,000 jin, but only 68,850 jin were reported. During the autumn harvest, the cooperative could have harvested more than 90,000 jin of grain, but they only reported 50,000 jin. Wang Bin (a well-to-do middle peasant), the deputy director of the cooperative, and Wang Chen (Wang Bin's younger brother), the accountant, created two sets of books from the beginning of the cooperative's establishment. One was the real book, which they used secretly; the other was a fake book, which they showed to the working staff. For example, one *dou* and three and a half *sheng* of soybeans were actually harvested, but only seven and a half *dou* were recorded in the fake book; five *shi* and two *dou* of buckwheat were actually harvested, but only four *shi* and seven *dou* were recorded in the fake book.

    2.  Well-to-do households invested large amounts of things that were not needed for production in the cooperative, exploiting the poor and hardship-stricken members in disguised form. According to the cooperative's scope of business, two carts were enough; but they invested three, one of which was often idle and useless, allowing the cooperative to pay interest for nothing. They also invested some odd things that were not necessary for production in the cooperative (such as old plows and hoes), which were discounted and calculated for interest, and the interest on the investment was much higher than that of banks and credit cooperatives. Director Yu Ling (a well-to-do middle peasant) alone invested more than 12 million yuan, accounting for more than 34% of the total investment of the cooperative. As a result, the cooperative had a large scale but an empty foundation, which significantly reduced labor income, with each labor day only being worth 1,200 yuan.

    3.  Speculating and profiteering in processing for supply and marketing cooperatives. This cooperative has a flour mill that makes vermicelli for the supply and marketing cooperative. It could have received a reasonable processing fee, but its leaders tried to adulterate the vermicelli to benefit themselves at the expense of the public. Once, when they sent 1,000 jin of vermicelli to the supply and marketing cooperative, they mixed in more than 70 jin of small starch paste (adding this paste reduces the quality of the vermicelli and increases the weight). They did not send the finished vermicelli to the supply and marketing cooperative on time, but first took it to the market to sell, and also arbitrarily increased the market price. They also privately purchased more than 2,700 jin of peas in various villages, undermining the state's unified purchase policy.

    4.  Disregarding agriculture and engaging in commerce. Deputy Director Wang Bin privately bought trees to split boards, planning to transport them to Chifeng for sale. When the district discovered this, they advised him to sell them to the supply and marketing cooperative. Wang Bin refused to sell because he thought the price was too low, and secretly sold them to the mine. The actual cost of each *zhang* of wooden board was only 80,000 yuan, but the selling price was as high as 160,000 yuan. Wang Bin often did not participate in agricultural labor, nor was he responsible for the cooperative's agricultural production. The cooperative originally had an idle cart, but to facilitate speculation, they bought a small rubber-wheeled cart.

    Their actions aroused the opposition of the poor peasant members. However, whoever opposed them the most would be attacked by the cooperative cadres. When they made false accounts, the poor peasant member Zhao Jinyu objected, but the accountant Wang Chen said, "This is for the sake of the whole cooperative!" Wang Bin was afraid that Zhao Jinyu would expose his bad behavior, so he came up with various ways to attack Zhao Jinyu, and threatened to beat him, in order to intimidate other members. The poor and hardship-stricken members felt resentful and wanted to withdraw from the cooperative. There were six party members and Youth League members in this cooperative, and the deputy secretary of the branch was also in this cooperative; however, they could not play the role that party members and Youth League members should play, and allowed these people to act recklessly.

    After the problem of the "Hongzhuang" cooperative was exposed, it aroused great attention from the local cadres. The CPC Rehe Provincial Committee has educated rural work cadres in various cities and banners to inspect the work of the agricultural production cooperatives they lead.

    The facts of this cooperative over the past year have raised a warning signal to rural work comrades in various places: do not think that farmers will advance along the socialist road just because they have organized agricultural production cooperatives. The problem of the "Hongzhuang" cooperative shows that with the progress of the cooperativization movement, the struggle between the new and old roads in the countryside is becoming more acute and complex. The struggle is not only taking place between the enemies outside the cooperative and the cooperative, but also within the cooperative. Within the peasantry, there are still some well-to-do middle peasants; among these well-to-do middle peasants, some have relatively serious capitalist ideas. These people originally did not like cooperativization, because cooperativization would break their dream of rising to become rich peasants. But when they saw the superiority of cooperativization in production, especially when they saw that the cooperativization movement had become an irresistible force, they might also join the cooperative. Of course, many well-to-do middle peasants joined the cooperative because they genuinely approved of cooperativization; however, some did not receive sufficient education when they joined the cooperative and did not abandon capitalist ideas; they often fought for leadership within the cooperative and tried their best to develop capitalist tendencies within the cooperative. If this cannot be corrected in time, some agricultural production cooperatives may deteriorate.

    This year, agricultural production cooperatives have developed even more, and some cooperatives have a poor foundation, and it is estimated that this situation is more likely to occur. Therefore, all localities should, in accordance with the party's class policy in the countryside, combine production work and the rectification work of the cooperative, and conduct a planned and step-by-step inspection of existing cooperatives, especially newly established cooperatives. It must be ensured that the leadership of the cooperative is indeed in the hands of poor and middle peasants with a higher socialist consciousness. Of course, both inspection and rectification work must rely on the masses, and the attitude of "imperial envoys" and commandism are not acceptable.

    What must be paid close attention to here is that the treatment of these peasants with relatively serious capitalist ideas should be fundamentally different from the treatment of counter-revolutionaries and landlords, rich peasants, and other exploiting elements. Because these people are laborers themselves, they are people in the peasant ranks, but they are only more deeply influenced by capitalist ideas and still try to take the capitalist road. As long as they are not allowed to stand in leadership positions and their political and ideological education is strengthened to raise their socialist consciousness, they can take the socialist road to common prosperity together with the poor peasants.

    究竟沿着什么道路前进
    仲夏
    中共热河省喀喇沁旗委在秋收分配工作中检查了两间房村“红庄”农业生产合作社的工作，发现这个社存在着严重的资本主义倾向。
    “红庄”农业生产合作社是一九五四年春季建立起来的，全社十二户，内有富裕中农两户、中农三户、贫农七户。建社时没有慎重选择领导干部，被资本主义思想严重的两户富裕中农操纵了领导权，使半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社没有沿着社会主义的道路前进。
    一年来，这个社有以下这些发展资本主义倾向的事实：
    一、隐瞒土地，少报产量，企图少缴公粮，躲避购粮。社成立时，实际丈量土地为四百九十六点五六亩，上报时却只报了四百零八亩；粮食应产量总共是十一万一千斤，上报时只报了六万八千八百五十斤。秋收时全社能打粮食九万多斤，他们只报了五万斤。社的副主任王斌（富裕中农）从建社开始就和会计王臣（王斌的弟弟）造了两套账。一本是真账，他们自己暗地用；一本是假账，给工作人员看。如一场?豆实打一石三斗半，在假账上只记七斗半；实收荞麦五石二斗，假账上只记四石七斗。
    二、富裕户大量投放合作社在生产上不需要的东西，变相剥削贫苦社员。按这个社的经营范围，有两辆车就够用；但他们却投入三辆，一辆经常闲着用不着，让合作社干打利息。他们还把一些社内生产不必需的零散东西（如旧犁杖、锄头等）投入社内，折价计息，并且投资的利息大大高过银行和信用社的利息。主任于龄（富裕中农）一人就投资一千二百多万元，占全社投资总数百分之三十四以上。结果，合作社摊子大、底子空，使劳动收入显著减少，每个劳动日只分一千二百元。
    三、在给供销社加工当中投机牟利。这个社有一座粉房，给供销合作社做粉条。它本来可以得到合理的加工费，但它的领导人却想法在粉条里掺杂使假，损公肥私。有一次给供销社送一千斤粉条，就掺了七十多斤小浆（掺上这种浆，粉质降低，重量增加）。做好粉条不按时送给供销社，却先拿到市场上出卖，还随便提高市价。他们还在各村私购豌豆二千七百多斤，破坏国家的统购政策。
    四、轻视农业，经营商业。副主任王斌私自买树破板，打算运到赤峰去卖。区里发觉了，劝他卖给供销社。王斌嫌价低不卖，偷着卖给矿山。每丈木板实际成本只合八万元，卖价却高达十六万元。王斌经常不参加农业劳动，对社的农业生产也不负责领导。社里本来闲着一辆车，为了作投机活动方便，他们又买了一辆小胶轮车。
    他们的这些行为，曾引起贫农社员的反对。可是，谁反对得厉害，谁就遭受社干部的打击。他们造假账时，贫农社员赵金玉曾提出反对，会计王臣却说：“这是为全社着想！”王斌又怕赵金玉揭发他的恶劣行为，就想出种种办法打击赵金玉，并威胁着说要打他，借以吓唬别的社员。贫苦社员都觉着别气，想退社。这个社里有六个党员团员，支部副书记也在这个社里；但是，他们并不能发挥党员、团员应有的作用，听任这些人胡作非为。
      “红庄”社的问题暴露以后，引起当地干部的极大注意。中共热河省委已经教育各市旗农村工作干部，检查自己所领导的农业生产合作社的工作。
    这个社一年来的事实，向各地农村工作同志提出了一个值得警惕的信号：不要以为农民组织了农业生产合作社，就一定会沿着社会主义道路前进。“红庄”社的问题说明：随着合作化运动的进度，农村新旧两条道路的斗争是更加尖锐和复杂了。斗争不只在社外的敌人和合作社之间进行着，也在社内进行着。在农民内部，还有一部分富裕中农；在这些富裕中农当中，有一些人有比较严重的资本主义思想。这些人原来是不喜欢合作化的，因为合作化要打破他们上升为富农的梦想。但当他们看到合作化在生产上的优越性，特别是看到合作化运动成为不可抗拒的力量的时候，他们也可能参加到社里来。当然，许多富裕中农入社是真心赞成合作化的；可是，也有一些在入社时并没有受到充分的教育，没有放弃资本主义思想；他们往往会在社内争夺领导权，极力在社内发展资本主义倾向。如果不能及时纠正，某些农业生产合作社就有变质的可能。
    今年农业生产合作社有了更大的发展，有些社建社基础不好，估计这种情况更有可能发生。因此，各地应当根据党在农村的阶级政策，结合生产工作和社的整顿工作，对现有的社特别是新建的社，有计划有步骤地进行一次检查。必须保证社的领导权确实掌握在社会主义觉悟较高的贫农和中农手里。当然，检查和整顿工作都必须依靠群众，用“钦差大臣”的态度和命令主义的手段，是不行的。
    这里必须十分注意的是，对待这些资本主义思想比较严重的农民，应当同对待反革命分子和地主、富农等剥削分子有原则的区别。因为这些人本身是劳动人民，是农民队伍中的人，只是受资本主义思想的影响较深，还企图走资本主义的路。只要不让他们站在领导岗位，并加强对他们的政治思想教育，提高他们的社会主义觉悟，他们是可以和贫苦农民一道走共同富裕的社会主义道路的。
