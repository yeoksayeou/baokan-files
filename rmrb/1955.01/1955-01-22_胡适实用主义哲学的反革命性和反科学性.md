Editor's Note: This article is a shortened and rewritten version of "Criticizing Hu Shih's Pragmatism," published in the first issue of this year's "Study" magazine. The article was discussed at the Hu Shih Thought Criticism Conference organized by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Writers Association. Some of the arguments in the article have been revised in principle by the author based on the opinions raised in the discussion and are republished here.

Hu Shih's pragmatist philosophy is a most reactionary and decadent idealist philosophy that grew out of the soil of American capitalism. This philosophy is actually nothing particularly new, but merely a branch of Machism, which was thoroughly refuted by Lenin in "Materialism and Empirio-Criticism." Hu Shih, this cultural comprador of the United States, brought pragmatism to China around the time of the May Fourth Movement. When the sound of the October Revolution began to bring Marxism to the Chinese people, Hu Shih immediately used pragmatism to help the reactionaries resolutely oppose this scientific revolutionary thought.

After the May Fourth Movement, the reactionary philosophical trends of thought of the imperialist countries were successively imported into China and had more or less influence among a section of intellectuals and the academic community. However, the most influential among them was pragmatism. There are two main reasons for this: First, it reflected the increasingly active and dominant trend of American imperialism's aggression against China over other imperialist countries; second, pragmatism more cunningly disguised its true colors with the "scientific" and "latest" philosophical camouflage than other reactionary philosophical schools. Hu Shih's criticism of some old culture and some textual research work around the May Fourth Movement strengthened this camouflage, causing many people in the intellectual and academic circles to be misled by it. The scientific masks used by pragmatism are: "the attitude of the laboratory" and "the theory of biological evolution." The anti-scientific and counter-revolutionary true colors of pragmatism are: subjective idealism, agnosticism, and vulgar evolutionism. Now, to criticize pragmatism, we must recognize its true colors and expose its masks.

I. Pragmatism is Subjective Idealism

All people with true scientific minds must acknowledge the objective reality of the material world, acknowledge that the material world came first, followed by mental phenomena, and acknowledge that spirit, consciousness, feeling, thinking, etc., are products of the development of matter to a higher stage. That is, they must acknowledge the materialist principle of the most fundamental question in philosophy: "Matter is primary, and spirit is secondary." Pragmatism's worldview is completely contrary to this materialist viewpoint required by science. Like Machism in Europe, it denies the objective reality of the material world and regards the surrounding world as merely people's sensations or the synthesis of sensations. The pragmatist James said: "What we call 'reality' contains three parts: (A) sensation, (B) various relationships between sensations and between images (can also be translated as 'ideas' - Ai), (C) old truths." [1] This formula tells us that pragmatists do not recognize "reality" as the objective reality of matter. On the contrary, they regard reality as merely something within the subjective realm of people: sensation, the relationship between sensation (or images), "old truths," etc. (Pragmatists believe that "truth is originally man-made, made for man, and made for human use" [2], so "old truths" are also a subjective element), which becomes what pragmatists call "reality"! Isn't this clear subjective idealism?

Hu Shih followed his teacher Dewey in pretending that pragmatism does not discuss the issue of materialism and idealism. He used Dewey's "views" on "experience" as an example, trying to prove that Dewey adopted an "unresolved" attitude towards the issue of materialism and idealism, and even praised Dewey greatly for this, saying that he was "a great revolutionist in the history of philosophy." Unfortunately, such "great revolutionists" had already appeared among the followers of Machist Avenarius. Lenin wrote in "Materialism and Empirio-Criticism": "We can only pity those who believe Avenarius and his gang, who think that by the word 'experience' they can transcend the 'old-fashioned' difference between materialism and idealism" [3]. Can Dewey also "transcend" this difference? Let's take two examples to study it. Dewey said: "Experience is indeed everything a living person deals with in the natural and social environment." He also said: "Experience is just an objective world entering into human behavior encounters, and undergoing various changes due to human reaction." "Experience is the way I deal with things, and things deal with me" [4]. Here, Dewey includes the opposite aspects of man and the environment of nature and society, the subjective behavior of mankind and the objective world, "I" and "things" in his concept of "experience," thinking that in this way he can "cover up the philosophical lines of materialism and idealism" [5]. However, how can it actually be covered up? Since the relationship between subjective and objective, me and things, people and the environment is involved, it is impossible to avoid the fundamental question that divides the philosophical lines of materialism and idealism: "Which of the two is primary? Which is secondary?" If Dewey, in his concept of "experience," regards man's subjectivity, me, as primary, and the objective environment and things must depend on my subjectivity, then he is still explaining experience on the line of idealism, and has not transcended the distinction between materialism and idealism. And in fact, that's exactly the case. To prove this, let's first take a look at how Dewey understands the concept of "environment"? Dewey said: "The environment, in other words, is any condition that interacts with an individual's needs, desires, purposes, and abilities to form existing experience. Even if a person builds a castle in the air, he is interacting with the object he constructs in his imagination." [6] What do these words tell us? It tells us that Dewey did not regard the "environment" as an objective condition that exists independently in the outside world without relying on people's subjective will, but only as a condition that can exist in interaction with people's subjective needs, desires, purposes, and abilities, and its existence is no different in principle from the "castle in the air" constructed in our subjective imagination. Isn't this obvious enough? Isn't this advocating that the objective environment depends on human subjectivity? Isn't this taking me and the subjective as primary and the objective things and environment as secondary? Isn't this standing on the side of idealism on the fundamental issue of philosophy? How could Dewey really be able to treat the issue of materialism and idealism with an "unresolved" attitude? How could he transcend these two fundamental lines of philosophy? Dewey's deliberately mystifying "views" on "experience" are just trying to cover up his subjective idealist line.

Acknowledging the objective reality of the material world, acknowledging that matter is primary, also means acknowledging the fact that the changes and development of the material world follow its own laws, and do not depend on human subjective will. People can understand these laws and use them to benefit society, but they can never violate these laws, and cannot arbitrarily change, create, or eliminate the laws of material change and development based on their own subjective will. Pragmatism's point of view is completely contrary to this materialist principle. Since it denies the objective reality of the material world and regards "reality" as a compound of subjective elements such as sensation, it cannot but draw absurd conclusions from this, believing that "reality" is completely dependent on people's will to change. Hu Shih said: "Reality is the reality we ourselves have transformed. This reality contains countless man-made molecules. Reality is a very obedient girl, who obeys our every wish to paint her up and dress her up." [7] Dewey also quoted James as saying: "Reality is like a piece of marble in our hands, which we sculpt into whatever we want." Here, the subjective idealist face of pragmatism is very blatantly manifested, and its absurdity is also very clear. Indeed, pragmatists like Hu Shih and his ilk often engage in shameless acts of smearing reality and reversing right and wrong in their words and writings, but real life is crushing such nonsense everywhere. First of all, the development of Chinese society did not "obey every wish" of Hu Shih, and all of Hu Shih's base actions to "smear" greasepaint for the reactionaries ultimately failed to prevent the victory of the Chinese revolution. All of Hu Shih's reactionary remarks and actions violated the laws of Chinese society and the development of the Chinese revolution, so it was crushed by the wheels of historical progress.

II. Subjective Idealist – Agnostic Epistemology

As mentioned above, the material world and the laws of its changes and development can be understood by people, are knowable, and human subjective understanding is a reflection of the objective material world. This is the fundamental viewpoint of materialist epistemology, also called the viewpoint of reflection. This is also the epistemological viewpoint that true science must follow. Scientific theoretical knowledge is a reflection of the laws of development of nature or society. We attach great importance to science because scientific research can help us correctly understand the laws of development of nature and society, so that we can guide our practical actions - production and construction, class struggle, etc. - to achieve victorious achievements. The Chinese Communist Party, guided by the scientific worldview of Marxism-Leninism - dialectical materialism and historical materialism - understands the laws of Chinese society and the development of the Chinese revolution, and can lead the struggle of the Chinese working class and the broad masses of the people to achieve both the victory of the new democratic revolution and the gradual victory of the socialist revolution.

Pragmatism's epistemological viewpoint is completely contrary to what is said above. It is an agnostic, subjective idealist epistemology. Since pragmatists deny the objective reality of the material world, they also deny any knowledge that can reflect objective things and the laws of their changes and development. Dewey opposed the reflection theory viewpoint of "regarding everyone's knowledge as a mirror, which reflects 'reality'," and advocated that "knowledge is not a mirror, but something to be used, useful in all directions. Sensation and reason are all to help the organism's ability to survive" [8]. Pragmatists believe that human understanding cannot reflect any objective things or their internal regularity beyond sensation (because the existence of the latter is something they do not acknowledge, or at least they think is worth "doubting"). Even the knowledge of scientific laws is regarded by pragmatists as a subjective fiction, not a reflection of the laws of development of objective things. Hu Shih said: "(1) Scientific rules and regulations are man-made, (2) are assumed" [9]. Pragmatists, who often have the word science on their lips, shamelessly slander science in this way. Those who truly love science should slap the faces of these cultural traitors who "pass off fish eyes for pearls" with subjective idealism - agnosticism! What is science? Lenin said: "The purpose of science is to provide a true ... photograph of the universe." Science is the study of the laws of development of all things in the objective world. Natural science is the study of the objective laws of development of all phenomena in nature. "Marxism is the science of the laws of development of nature and society, the science of the revolution of the oppressed and exploited masses, the science of the victory of socialism in all countries, and the science of the construction of communist society." [10] Scientific research is based on the materialist epistemological foundation that objective things and the laws of their development can be known by people. In the field of true science, there is no room for subjective idealism - agnosticism. Stalin said:
      "The world and its laws are entirely knowable, and our
  knowledge of the laws of nature that has been tested by
  experience and practice is definite knowledge with the significance
  of objective truth. There is nothing unknowable in the world, but
  only things that are not yet known, but will be revealed and
  understood by scientific and practical forces in the future." [11]
    Therefore, scientific knowledge is by no means "man-made" and "assumed," by no means a subjective fiction, but "definite knowledge with the significance of objective truth." The reason why scientific knowledge becomes such definite knowledge is that it has been or can withstand the test of human social practice. Natural and social scientific knowledge is produced on the basis of our practice - production activities, class struggle, scientific experiments, etc. - and then guides our practice to achieve victory, which can prove that it correctly reflects the regularity of objective things themselves. Engels said: "Since we are able to prove the correctness of our understanding of a phenomenon by the fact that we can ourselves produce a certain phenomenon of nature, produce it according to the conditions of this phenomenon, and make it serve our purposes, then Kant's elusive 'thing-in-itself' is finished." [12] Therefore, the knowledge of natural science, because it has passed the test of human production practice and scientific experiments, proves that it is knowledge that reflects the laws of development of nature and has objective truth. As for the fact that Marxist scientific theory can correctly reflect the laws of development of nature and society, the laws of the revolutionary struggle of the oppressed and exploited masses, the victory of socialism in all countries, and the laws of communist construction, this has been repeatedly proven in the long-term practical struggles of the working class and the broad masses of people in various countries around the world - especially in the Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries.

III. The "Truth" View that Obliterates the Standards of Truth and Falsehood

Materialist epistemology points out that knowledge is a reflection of objective things in human subjective consciousness, and whether knowledge is correct depends on whether its content truthfully reflects objective reality and conforms to the regularity of the development of objective things. Therefore, there are strict objective standards between right and wrong, between truth and falsehood. Human understanding can conform to the regularity of the development of objective things, which is knowledge with truth, otherwise it is a fallacy. This is also the principle that all people with truly scientific minds must acknowledge. Pragmatism's view of "truth" is completely contrary to this materialist principle, and regards truth as something purely subjective. Since pragmatists deny the objective reality of the material world, they also deny any knowledge that can reflect objective things and the laws of their development, and regard human understanding - including scientific knowledge - as merely a subjective fiction of people, "a tool to deal with the environment." Therefore, in their eyes, whether a kind of knowledge has "truth" significance is not determined by whether it can truthfully reflect objective reality. They do not acknowledge the existence of objective reality at all, so they cannot talk about reflecting objective reality at all. What they care about is only whether a kind of knowledge and thought can help them achieve the purpose of "dealing with the environment" according to their subjective requirements. That is to say, they do not acknowledge that there are any objective standards between right and wrong, between truth and falsehood. They regard the standards of truth and falsehood as completely subjective. Hu Shih said: "Truth is the method to deal with this situation, so if it cannot deal with it, it is not truth; if it can deal with it, it is truth" [13]. Scientific truth, in the eyes of pragmatists, does not reflect the objective laws of development of nature and society, but is merely a temporarily recognized hypothesis that people subjectively think is the most convenient in application. "Scientific rules and regulations are just the most applicable assumptions, but are now publicly recognized as the most convenient assumptions for explaining natural phenomena" [14]. Therefore, in the eyes of pragmatists, whether a thought is scientific truth is determined by whether it is "now publicly recognized" by people as "the most convenient assumption," a subjective standard. According to these absurd views of pragmatism, then, there is no essential difference between scientific knowledge and myths, superstitions, and even rumors and slanders, and they can even be equated. If myths and superstitions are once "now publicly recognized" by people as "the most convenient assumption," pragmatists must regard them as "truth." Conversely, even if it is a scientific truth that correctly reflects the laws of development of objective things, if it is inconvenient for the various base and shameless reactionary behaviors of pragmatists, they will have the audacity to deny its truth. Therefore, the pragmatist James can call the belief in God "truth," Hu Shih can sophistically deny imperialist aggression and deny the existence of feudal forces in old China, but adopts a fanatical opposition attitude towards the scientific truth of Marxism. The original intention of pragmatists to fabricate this "truth" view that obliterates objective standards of truth and falsehood is precisely to make it a "tool to deal with the environment" for the reactionaries to obliterate revolutionary truth, arbitrarily "smear" reality, and arbitrarily fabricate lies!

In this way, pragmatism's subjective idealist view of "truth" is also completely relativistic at the same time. Since pragmatists regard their "truth" as merely a temporarily recognized "assumption" that is most convenient for "dealing with the environment," they do not acknowledge any absolute nature of "truth," but believe that it can be arbitrarily changed according to the subjective "public recognition" of pragmatists and the reactionaries they support. Hu Shih said: "There is no absolute truth, ... the knowledge we humans want ... is this truth of this time, this situation, this me" [15]. That is to say, the "truth" that pragmatists call is dependent on the pragmatist's subjectivity - "me," whatever "I" think is convenient is truth, whatever "I" think is inconvenient, even if it is an objectively proven scientific law, "I" can still obliterate its truth. "I" can arbitrarily confuse black and white and reverse right and wrong according to whether "I" think it is convenient or not, which is the logical conclusion that the pragmatist's relativist "truth" view must reach.

Human understanding of truth has relativity, which does not mean that the truth or falsehood of the content of understanding can be changed according to people's subjective will and subjective wishes. The relativity of truth is due to the relativity of the objective things themselves reflected by people's understanding, and is due to the fact that objective things are constantly changing and developing things that vary according to conditions, locations, and times. The specific processes in a certain stage of development of objective things are all relative. Therefore, "people's understanding of specific processes at various certain stages of development only has relative truth" [16]. However, first, although the truth of the understanding of a certain specific process is relative, the reason why it has truth is primarily because it correctly reflects the objective process of the development of things, and not because it is an assumption that "I" think is convenient. Truth and falsehood are definitely not transferred according to "my" subjectivity, but depend on whether it reflects objective reality. The standard of right and wrong, truth and falsehood is always on the objective side, which is absolute and cannot be shaken at any time, and cannot be arbitrarily reversed by subjective idealist - agnostic pragmatists at any time. Second, since the relativity of truth originates from the relativity of the specific process of development of the things it reflects, therefore, the meaning of relativity here only means that our understanding should develop with the development of things, and should not stop at a fixed point. If we are satisfied with the existing achievements of knowledge and do not know how to strive for new knowledge with the emergence of fresh things, or if we regard the understanding of old things as a dead formula to rigidly apply to new things, our understanding will inevitably make mistakes. The relativity of truth must not be interpreted as we can arbitrarily obliterate the truth of a scientific knowledge when it is subjectively inconvenient for us. As long as a scientific knowledge correctly reflects a certain specific process of development of things, its conformity to the objective truth of the laws of the development of this process cannot be obliterated at any time. In this sense, its truth has an absolute nature. We can only say that when the specific process has changed, this scientific knowledge is not applicable to the new process, or that it should be supplemented and developed. In this sense, its truth is relative. Therefore, admitting the relativity of truth does not mean that we can deny it as an objective truth that correctly reflects a certain specific process because it is not applicable under conditions that have already changed, and we can also call the knowledge that has been proven by practice to have objective truth something wrong. The meaning of "truth becomes a fallacy" [17] only means that when we treat these knowledge incorrectly, when we treat it as a dead formula and randomly apply it to unsuitable processes, it will cause our own cognitive errors in our subjectivity, and it is not allowed for pragmatists to reverse right and wrong here. Third, although the specific process of development of things at a certain stage is relative, the entire universe, which is the sum of countless specific processes, is absolutely existent. The development of human understanding also reflects this objective situation: Although the understanding that reflects a certain specific process only has relative truth, the sum of countless relative truths is the absolute truth that reflects the total universe. Therefore, contrary to the purely relativistic fallacy of pragmatists, there is not only relative truth in the world, absolute truth also exists. Relative truth has absolute qualities. Every relative truth that reflects a certain specific process, as an objective truth, it is already absolute. And it itself is a constituent part of the total absolute truth, and also has the nature of absolute truth in this respect.

IV. Not Scientific Evolutionism, but Vulgar Evolutionism

Pragmatists use the name of the theory of biological evolution as a mask for their anti-scientific ideas. It dresses up subjective idealism as if it were a scientific point of view that conforms to the theory of evolution. It flaunts the use of the principles of evolutionism to explain human life. Everyone knows that human social life has its own special laws of development, and cannot be simply reduced to the laws of evolution in the biological world. Pragmatists do this, which both distorts human life and distorts the theory of biological evolution.

Pragmatists regard people's experience, knowledge, truth, etc., as merely "tools to deal with the environment," and insist that this is the application of the scientific principles of adapting to the environment in the biological world. This is a great slander on human knowledge and human life! As has been said before, human understanding is a reflection of objective reality, and scientific knowledge reflects the internal regularity of the development of objective things. Human beings grasp correct theoretical knowledge, grasp scientific truth, and can foresee the future development of surrounding events, so that their practical actions can become purposeful and conscious actions, and their struggles - production struggles, revolutionary movements, etc. - can be invincible. It cannot be said that human actions are all animal-like activities of "coping with the environment" without rational minds and clear guidance, and it cannot be said that human understanding, scientific truth, etc., are merely tools for blindly "coping with the environment." Pragmatists regard human understanding as "tools to deal with the environment," which only reflects the corruption and reaction of the thoughts and lives of pragmatists themselves. If we look at the thoughts and lives of pragmatists like Hu Shih and his ilk and the reactionaries they support, it can be said that there are some aspects that are similar to animals. The laws of historical development dictate that all reactionaries will move towards extinction. They do not dare to recognize it head-on, so they do not dare to admit the objective laws of surrounding events. All they can do is blindly struggle to the death. Therefore, they need to seek any "tools to deal with the environment" that can help them prolong their lives, and pragmatists plan for them, saying that "experience," "knowledge," etc. can also be used as such tools, so they fabricate a set of agnostic - subjective idealist fallacies for this purpose. In terms of the blindness of "coping," the life situation of the reactionaries and the teachings of the pragmatists do have animal-like characteristics, but this is completely irrelevant to the lives and thoughts of the vast majority of progressive human beings. Moreover, the survival movement of animals adapting to the environment is to change the nature of their organisms to adapt to changes in certain objective conditions in nature. That is, it spontaneously follows certain objective laws of development. The behavior of biological adaptation to the environment does not contain the kind of subjective idealist delusion of pragmatists, and does not have the slightest attempt to treat "reality" as a "very obedient girl" who can be arbitrarily "smeared" and "dressed up." But when pragmatists talk about "dealing with the environment," they hold extremely arrogant subjective idealist fantasies. Dewey said: "The progress of life lies entirely in being able to manage the environment. The activities of life must transform all the changes around them; harmful forces must be transformed into harmless forces; harmless forces must be transformed into forces that help us" [18]. The reactionaries are increasingly moving towards collapse, but they still want to use all base and shameless means, methods, and "tools" to carry out blind and frantic struggles,妄想arbitrarily to transform all the changes around them according to their subjective purposes, in order to prolong their ruling position of "managing the environment." This is the true meaning of what pragmatists call "dealing with the environment"! Pragmatists steal the concept of "adapting to the environment" from the theory of biological evolution as their signboard. In fact, the laws of biological evolution of adapting to the environment and the subjective fantasies of pragmatists of "dealing with the environment" are fundamentally irrelevant.

Hu Shih spread the fallacy of "evolution bit by bit" and "transformation bit by bit," denied "fundamental solutions" [19], and pretended that this was also the thought of scientific evolutionism. People know that Hu Shih's notorious fallacy was spread not long after the May Fourth Movement, when China's advanced figures began to accept Marxist ideas and the movement of the Chinese people against imperialism and the feudal rule of the Northern Warlords was rising. History has long proven that in old China, under the rule of such extremely brutal and corrupt reactionaries, it was impossible for history to move forward without revolutionary struggle. In that situation, talking about evolution bit by bit and opposing fundamental solutions was in fact not solving anything bit by bit; it was in fact not making any progress at all. All of Hu Shih's own actions are enough to prove the reaction and hypocrisy of this vulgar evolutionist thought.

Human social history includes the movement of class struggle and revolutionary change, while these forms of movement do not exist in the evolutionary process of the biological world, so the laws of biological evolution must not be used to explain the movement of human society. Moreover, changes in biological species are also a leap-like fundamental change. Although this leap takes the form of a gradual transition, it cannot be simply reduced to "evolution bit by bit." Therefore, pragmatists also distort the laws of biological evolution here. What it propagates is not the truly scientific idea of evolution, but only a fallacy of vulgar evolutionism.

There is another fundamental difference between the vulgar evolutionist thought spread by Hu Shih and true scientific evolutionism, that is, scientific evolutionism proves that the movement and development of the biological world has certain inevitable objective laws, while Hu Shih's vulgar evolutionism regards development as a random combination of a large number of events without any order. Hu Shih once extremely exaggerated the role of personal accidental behavior, trying to use this to drown out the inevitable laws of historical development. He said that a person "spitting a mouthful of phlegm on the ground may destroy a village or a tribe. An idea that he starts may cause decades of bloody battles. He may 'with one word, make a nation rise, or with one word, make a nation fall.' Good is immortal, and evil is immortal; making great contributions to the world is of course immortal, planting a load of grain can also be immortal, drinking a glass of wine, and spitting a mouthful of phlegm can also be immortal" [20]. It is easy to understand that this anti-scientific view of accidental worship is also a manifestation of subjective idealism - agnosticism. Subjective idealism denies the objective reality of the material world and the laws of its development, and cannot but regard all things and their changing processes as accidental things. This idealist arrogance cannot withstand the slightest serious refutation. Although the development process of objective things is constantly affected by accidental factors, the inevitable law is what dominates the development process, and any deviation caused by accidental factors will eventually be drowned out by the inevitable general trend. Not to mention that spitting a mouthful of phlegm and drinking a glass of wine will not have any "immortal" effect, even if it is like Hu Shih using his personal lifelong strength to help the reactionaries deceive the people and oppose the revolutionary movement, because it violates the inevitable laws of the development of Chinese society and the Chinese revolution, the result will still be crushed by the revolutionary people, and even some of the remaining poisonous influences in thought will eventually be completely eliminated by the people. The absurd view of pragmatists to worship chance cannot stand at all in the face of facts. The role of pragmatists in spreading this nonsense is nothing more than妄想借此来否认to deny the existence of inevitable laws in the process of natural and social development, to deny that class contradictions, contradictions between new and old things, and the struggle between all aspects are the fundamental content and source of natural and social development, that is,妄想借此来反对to oppose scientific knowledge of laws, to oppose Marxist revolutionary thought, and to oppose the revolutionary movement of the broad masses of the people. On the other hand, this is only reflecting the desperate psychology of the reactionaries who are approaching extinction and hoping to rely on some accidental miracle to be lucky enough to be saved.

V. Not a Scientific Method, but a Method for Subjective Idealists to "Cope with the Environment"

The deceptive effect of pragmatism on many intellectuals and academics lies particularly in the method aspect. Pragmatists use the "attitude of the laboratory" as a sign, and disguise their methods as the most like science. Many deceived people mistake this disguise for its essence. In fact, the pragmatist method is not a truly scientific method that can help us discover the objective laws of development of things. It is actually a subjective idealist method of fabricating facts, and it is a method to help the reactionaries "cope with the environment" and carry out a dying struggle.

The pragmatist method only seems scientific in form. Hu Shih summarized this form into three parts or three steps: "(1) Start with concrete facts and situations; (2) All doctrines and ideals, all knowledge, are only assumptions to be tested, not natural principles; (3) All doctrines and ideals must be tested by practice; experiment is the only touchstone of truth" [21]. Sometimes he writes this form more simply, that is: "Carefully search for facts, boldly propose hypotheses, and then carefully seek confirmation." [22] Such a form is easily confused with a truly scientific method. If we only pay attention to its form, we will inevitably be deceived. To expose the anti-scientific nature of the pragmatist method, it must be criticized in connection with its form and its subjective idealist content in order to achieve the goal.

First, let's talk about the so-called first step of the pragmatist method, that is, "start with concrete facts and situations" or "carefully search for facts." Where is the anti-scientific nature here? It lies in the fact that the "facts" that pragmatists flaunt to collect are not the facts required at the beginning of truly scientific research. Scientific research first requires correct scientific ideas and methods as a guide, and does not allow mindless digging into "facts." The thought method mentioned here is the universal principle of Marxism - dialectical materialism and historical materialism. Under the guidance of this scientific thought method, scientific research first requires us to "start from the actual things that exist objectively," and requires us to "possess the materials in detail" [23] before starting research. That is to say, we should strictly abide by the principle of materialism from the very beginning, and focus on "the actual things that exist objectively" and "possessing the materials in detail," and there should be no subjective arbitrariness mixed in the middle. This is fundamentally different from the so-called "starting from concrete facts and situations" and "carefully searching for facts" that pragmatists generally talk about. The actual things that exist objectively are by no means isolated one by one, but are organically connected to each other. There is a distinction between major and minor in actual things, and a distinction between fundamental things and non-fundamental things. Scientific research must be based on this objectively existing fact. On the one hand, it must possess rich materials in detail, and on the other hand, it must pay its main attention to some fundamental facts, which is the core of analyzing and connecting all factual materials. For example, historical materialism tells us that the most fundamental actual things in human social life are production and class struggle. Therefore, when starting to study the problems of human society, we must pay our main attention to these fundamental facts of production and class struggle, and we must take the analysis and study of class contradictions as the central link of the research. For example, in the study of history, we must take the historical development of production and the situation of class struggle as the central link of the research, and should not take geographical, population, and ideological and cultural conditions as the central link (although these should also be studied). In the study of classical literature (such as Dream of the Red Chamber), we must focus on the analysis of the class background and class content of the work, and should not focus on the author, the book, and other minor facts like Hu Shih (although the study of these facts is also necessary). Only by starting the research in this way can we hope to complete the tasks required by scientific research. Only by arranging the starting point correctly can we not go the wrong way forward.

When talking about the "facts" and "situations" that pragmatists call, we must not forget that pragmatists regard "reality" as a compound of subjective elements such as human sensations and the relationships between sensations, as a "very obedient girl" who is "obedient" and allows people to "smear" and "dress up," and as a combination of a large number of accidental events without order. These idealist views cannot stand in front of science at all, but the ideological basis of the pragmatist research method is precisely these subjective idealist fallacies. When pragmatists talk about "carefully searching for facts," they do not "possess the materials in detail" strictly according to the "actual things that exist objectively," but propose questions and start research according to subjective "interests and the will to set the goals of selection" and according to accidental "difficult situations" [24]. They will never follow the order of "actual things that exist objectively" themselves, and put the research attention on certain fundamental facts. On the contrary, they use some minor facts and problems as the focus of research based on their own subjective "interests and will." Therefore, Hu Shih took the textual research of the author and the book of classical literature as the main goal of research, and completely ignored the social background and class content of the work. Mr. Yu Pingbo's research on "Dream of the Red Chamber" also spent a great deal of effort on such trivial issues as the ranking of the girls in the Yi Hong Courtyard based on subjective accidental interests. The results of such research can only make a little achievement at most in the work of collating materials - such as the meaning of a word or the author of a book, and they will become more and more confused about the things themselves and cannot recognize their essence and laws. As for Hu Shih attributing the reasons for the chaos in Chinese society to his own troubles with "five ghosts" - "poverty, disease, ignorance, corruption, and disturbance" [25], and obliterating the imperialist aggression and the existence of feudal forces, these fundamental reasons, this is even enough to expose that the method of "searching for facts" by pragmatists is not "starting from the actual things that exist objectively," but just arbitrarily piecing together facts according to the subjective purpose of supporting the reactionaries.

Now let's talk about the second step - the question of hypothesis. Scientific research often goes through the stage of hypothesis; when we have done some degree of analysis and research on factual materials, and initially conclude some theoretical principles from here, but have not been able to finally determine whether it completely conforms to the objective laws of the development of things, we regard these principles as unproven hypotheses. It is necessary to wait for further practical testing to prove that it does correctly reflect the objective laws of the development of things before affirming it as a scientific law with complete objective truth. It is also common for scientific hypotheses to be modified or supplemented, or even fundamentally transformed after being tested in practice. However, although a scientific hypothesis is not a finally determined objective truth, it is a step for people to recognize objective truth through scientific research. Therefore, scientists must strive to make the assumptions made by their research as consistent as possible with objective truth, and strive to make it withstand the test of practice as much as possible. Therefore, when formulating hypotheses, first, it must be based on rich factual materials, especially the ability to grasp the most important and fundamental facts. Without rich factual materials or without grasping the fundamental facts, and only relying on some trivial facts, it is impossible to make assumptions according to the goal of reflecting the laws of objective things as correctly as possible. Without the factual materials of class struggle, it is impossible to make assumptions as consistent as possible with objective truth in the study of social history. Second, when making assumptions, we must be careful and prudent, seek truth from facts, and try to avoid subjective factors. We must carefully analyze the specific contradictory movements of all aspects of things shown in the factual materials under the guidance of scientific thought methods, such as the careful analysis of the contradiction between productive forces and production relations and the contradictory movement of classes in the study of social history. Therefore, the principle of formulating scientific assumptions must be strict, not "bold." Pragmatist Hu Shih flaunts "bold assumptions," which is not a scientific method, but a subjective idealist method. The purpose of subjective idealists - pragmatists - when studying problems is to find some "

    胡适实用主义哲学的反革命性和反科学性
    艾思奇
    实用主义是美国资本主义土壤里生长起来的一种最反动最腐朽的唯心论哲学。这种哲学实际上并不是什么特别的新东西，而只是被列宁在“唯物论与经验批判论”里驳斥得体无完肤的马赫主义的一种流派。胡适这个美国的文化买办，在五四运动前后把实用主义拿到中国来贩卖。当着十月革命的炮声给中国人民开始送来了马克思主义的时候，胡适立刻就用实用主义来帮着反动派坚决反对这科学的革命的思想。
    帝国主义各国的反动哲学思潮在五四运动以后先后都输入到中国来，并在一部分知识分子和学术界中间或多或少地发生了影响，但其中影响最大的，首先是实用主义。这原因主要有两点：第一，这反映了美帝国主义对中国的侵略活动日愈积极，日愈凌驾在其他帝国主义国家之上的趋向；第二，实用主义比其他的反动哲学流派更为狡猾地用“科学”的“最新”哲学的伪装把自己的真面目掩盖起来，胡适在五四运动前后对一部分旧文化的批评活动和一些考据工作加强了这种伪装作用，使知识分子和学术界中相当多的人受到了它的迷惑。实用主义所使用的科学的假面具是：“实验室的态度”，“生物进化学说”。实用主义的反科学反革命的真面目是：主观唯心论，不可知论，庸俗进化论。我们现在来批判实用主义，就必须认清它的真面目，揭破它的假面具。
    一、实用主义就是主观唯心论
    一切有真正科学头脑的人，都要承认物质世界的客观实在性，承认先有物质世界，后有精神现象，承认精神、意识、感觉、思维等等是物质发展到高级阶段的产物，也就是要承认“物质是第一性的东西，精神是第二性的东西”这一个哲学上最根本问题的唯物论的原理。实用主义的世界观，恰恰和科学所要求的这一个唯物论观点完全相反，它和欧洲的马赫主义一样，否认了物质世界的客观实在性，而把周围世界看做仅只是人的感觉或感觉的综合。实用主义者詹姆士说：“我们所谓‘实在’含有三大部分：（A）感觉，（B）感觉与感觉之间及意象（也可译作‘观念’——艾）与意象之间的种种关系，（C）旧有的真理。”〔一〕这个公式告诉我们，实用主义者不承认“实在”是物质的客观实在，相反地却把实在看做仅仅是人们的主观领域以内的东西：感觉，感觉（或意象）之间的关系，“旧有的真理”等等主观的要素的复合（实用主义者认为“真理原来是人造的，是为了人造的，是人造出来供人用的”〔二〕，所以“旧有的真理”也是一种主观的要素），就成为实用主义者所谓的“实在”！这不是很明白的主观唯心论吗？
    胡适曾跟着他的老师杜威假装说实用主义不谈唯物唯心的问题。他曾把杜威关于“经验”的“见解”作为例子，想来证明杜威对于唯物唯心的问题是采了“以不了了之”的态度，并且还因此把杜威大捧一顿，说他“在哲学史上是一个大革命家”。可惜得很，这样的“大革命家”在马赫主义者阿万那留斯的信徒中间早已出现过了。列宁在“唯物论与经验批判论”里这样写着：“我们只能怜惜那些相信阿万那留斯及其一伙的人，他们以为经过‘经验’这个字眼就可以超越唯物论与唯心论底‘陈旧的’差别”〔三〕。杜威也能“超越”这个差别吗？我们且举两条来研究一下。杜威说：“经验确是一个活人对于自然的环境和社会环境所起的一切交涉”。又说：“经验只是一个物观（应译作‘客观’——艾）的世界，走进人类的行为遭遇里面，受了人类的反动发生种种变迁”。“经验乃我对付物，物对付我的法子”〔四〕。在这里，杜威把人和自然与社会的环境，人类的主观行为和客观世界，“我”和“物”等对立的两方面包括在他的“经验”概念之内，以为这样一来就可以“掩盖了哲学上的唯物论的路线和唯心论的路线”〔五〕。然而，实际上怎么能掩盖得了呢？既然涉及到了主观和客观、我和物、人和环境之间的关系，就不能回避那划分哲学上唯物论路线和唯心论路线的根本问题：“两者之间那一方面是第一性的？那一方面是第二性的？”如果杜威在他的“经验”的概念里面，把人的主观，我，看做第一性的，而客观环境和物都要依赖着我的主观为转移，那么，他仍然只是在唯心论的路线上来解释经验，而并没有超越唯物论与唯心论的区别。而事实上恰恰就是这样。为要证明这一点，不妨让我们先来看看杜威如何了解“环境”这个概念？杜威说：“环境，换句话说，就是与个人的需要、欲望、目的和能力相互作用着以构成现有经验的任何的条件。一个人即使建筑一座空中楼阁，他也是与其在想像中所构成的对象相互作用着。”〔六〕这些话告诉我们什么呢？它告诉我们，杜威没有把“环境”看做不依赖人的主观意志而在外界独立存在的客观条件，而仅只是在与人们主观的需要、欲望、目的和能力等的相互作用中才能存在的条件，并且它的存在是与我们主观想像中所构成的“空中楼阁”没有什么原则区别的。这还不够明显吗？这不是主张客观环境依赖人的主观为转移吗？这不是把我和主观当做第一性的东西而把客观的物、环境当做第二性的东西吗？这不正是在哲学的根本问题上站到了唯心论方面来了吗？杜威何尝真的能够“以不了了之”的态度来对待唯物唯心的问题？何尝能超越哲学的这两条根本路线？杜威对“经验”的故作玄虚的“见解”，不过是想掩盖他的主观唯心论路线吧了。
    承认了物质世界的客观实在性，承认了物质是第一性的东西，也就要承认这样的事实：物质世界的变化发展，是遵循着它自己本身的规律，而不是依赖着人的主观意志为转移的。人们可以认识这些规律，并且利用这些规律来为社会谋福利，但决不能违背这些规律，不能凭自己的主观意志任意改变、创造或消灭物质的变化发展规律。实用主义的观点却与这唯物论的原则完全相反，它既然否认了物质世界的客观实在性，而把“实在”看做感觉等主观要素的复合，它就不能不由此做出荒谬绝伦的结论，认为“实在”是完全依赖着人的意志而变化的。胡适说：“实在是我们自己改造过的实在。这个实在里面含有无数人造的分子。实在是一个很服从的女孩子，他百依百顺的由我们替他涂抹起来，装扮起来。”〔七〕杜威也引用詹姆士的话说：“实在好比一块大理石到了我们手里，由我们雕成什么样。”在这里，实用主义的主观唯心论的面目已十分露骨地表现出来，它的荒谬可笑，也是非常明白了。诚然，实用主义者胡适之流在他们的言论文字里是经常做着无耻的涂抹现实，颠倒是非的勾当的，但实际生活到处都在粉碎这种胡说。首先中国社会的发展，对于胡适就没有“百依百顺”，胡适的一切替反动派“涂抹”脂粉的卑劣行为始终没有能够阻止住中国革命的胜利。胡适的一切反动言论和行为违背了中国社会和中国革命发展的规律，因此它就被历史前进的车轮压得粉碎。
    二、主观唯心论的—不可知论的认识论
    如上所说，物质世界及其变化发展的规律是能够为人们所认识的，是可知的，人的主观认识就是客观的物质世界的反映。这是唯物论的认识论的根本观点，也叫做反映论的观点。这也是真正的科学所要遵循的认识论观点。科学的理论知识，就是自然界或社会发展规律的反映，我们所以对科学予以高度的重视，就是因为科学的研究能够帮助我们正确地认识自然界和社会发展规律，使我们有可能指导自己的实践行动——生产建设，阶级斗争，等等——获得胜利的成就。中国共产党以马克思列宁主义的科学世界观——辩证唯物论和历史唯物论——作为向导，认识了中国社会和中国革命发展的规律，就能够领导中国工人阶级和广大人民的斗争，既取得了新民主主义革命的胜利，又正在逐步获得社会主义革命的胜利。
    实用主义的认识论观点和以上所说的完全相反。它是一种不可知论的，主观唯心论的认识论。实用主义者既否认了物质世界的客观实在性，也就否认了任何能够反映客观事物及其变化发展规律的知识。杜威反对“把人人的知识看作一面镜的样子、把‘实在’照下来便是”的反映论观点，而主张“知识并不是镜子、是用的东西、各方都用得着。感觉理性、都是帮助有机体的生存能力”〔八〕。实用主义者认为人的认识不能反映感觉以外的任何客观事物及其内部规律性（因为后者的存在是他们所不承认的，至少是他们认为值得“存疑”的）。即使是科学规律的知识，也被实用主义者看做主观的虚构，而不是客观事物发展规律的反映。胡适说：“（一）科学律例是人造的，（二）是假定的”〔九〕。口头上经常挂着科学两个字的实用主义者，却这样无耻地来诬蔑科学。真正爱护科学的人，要打这些用主观唯心论——不可知论来“鱼目混珠”的文化奸商的耳光！科学是什么？列宁说：“科学的宗旨就是提供宇宙底真正的……写真”。科学就是研究客观世界一切事物发展规律的学问。自然科学，就是研究自然界一切现象的客观发展规律的学问，“马克思主义是关于自然和社会底发展规律的科学，是关于被压迫与被剥削群众革命的科学，是关于社会主义在一切国家中胜利的科学，是关于共产主义社会建设的科学。”〔十〕科学的研究，就是建立在客观事物及其发展规律能够为人所认识这一个唯物论的认识论基础之上的。在真正科学的领域里，没有主观唯心论—不可知论立足的余地。斯大林说：
      “世界及其规律完全可能认识，我们对于自
  然界规律的那些已由经验和实践考验过的知识是
  具有客观真理意义的确实知识，世界上没有不可
  认识之物，而只有现在尚未认识，但将来却会由
  科学和实践力量揭示和认识之物。”〔十一〕
    所以，科学知识决不是“人造的”和“假定的”，决不是主观的虚构，而是“具有客观真理意义的确实知识”。科学知识之所以成为这种确实的知识，是因为它经过了或者经得起人类社会实践的考验。自然的和社会的科学知识在我们的实践——生产活动，阶级斗争科学实验等等——的基础上产生，并且又指导我们的实践获得胜利，这就能证明它正确地反映了客观事物本身的规律性。恩格斯说：“既然我们能够用亲自制造出自然界某一现象、依这现象的条件把它生产出来、并使它为我们的目的服务的事实，来证明我们对于这一现象理解的正确，那么康德所说的不可捉摸的‘自在之物’就完结了。”〔十二〕所以，自然科学的知识，由于通过人类的生产实践和科学实验的检验，就证明了它是反映自然界发展规律的具有客观真理性的知识。至于马克思主义科学理论之能正确地反映自然界和社会发展的规律，被压迫与被剥削群众的革命斗争的规律，社会主义在一切国家获得胜利和共产主义建设的规律，这是在世界各国——特别是苏联，中国以及各人民民主国家的工人阶级和广大人民群众的长期实践斗争中已经反复被证明过了的。
    三、抹煞真伪标准的“真理”观
    唯物论的认识论指明认识是客观事物在人类主观意识里的反映，认识的正确与否，决定于它的内容是否如实地反映了客观的现实事物，是否符合于客观事物发展的规律性。所以，是与非之间，真理与谬误之间，是有着严格的客观标准的。人的认识能够符合于客观事物发展的规律性，这就是具有真理性的认识，否则就是谬误。这也是一切真正有科学头脑的人所要承认的原则。实用主义的“真理”观，恰恰又和这一个唯物论的原则完全相反，把真理看做纯粹主观的东西，实用主义者否认了任何能反映客观事物及其发展规律的知识，把人的认识——包括科学知识在内——看做仅仅是人们主观地虚构出来的“应付环境的工具”，因此，在他们的眼中，一种知识是否具有“真理”意义，就不是决定于它是否能够如实地反映客观现实。他们根本就不承认客观现实的存在，所以也就完全谈不到反映客观现实的问题。他们所关心的只是一种知识、思想能否帮助他们达到按照他们的主观要求来“应付环境”的目的。这就是说，他们不承认是与非之间，真理与谬误之间有任何客观的标准。他们把真理与谬误的标准完全看做主观的，胡适说：“真理是对付这个境地的方法，所以他若不能对付，便不是真理；他能对付，便是真理”〔十三〕。科学的真理，在实用主义者看起来，也并没有反映了自然界和社会发展的客观规律，而只是人们在主观的应用上认为最方便的一时公认的假设。“科学律例不过是一些最适用的假设，不过是现在公认为解释自然现象最方便的假设”〔十四〕，所以，在实用主义者看来，一种思想是否科学真理，是决定于它是否被人们“现在公认”为“最方便的假设”这一个主观的标准。按照实用主义的这些荒谬观点说来，那么，科学知识和神话迷信以至于谣言诽语之间，就没有什么本质的区别，并且甚至可以互相等同起来了。神话迷信如果一旦被人们“现在公认”为“最方便的假设”，实用主义者就一定要把它当作“真理”看待。反之，即使是正确反映了客观事物发展规律的科学真理，如果对于实用主义者的种种卑鄙无耻的反动行为有所不便时，他们就要厚着脸皮来否认它的真理性。所以，实用主义者詹姆士可以把上帝的信仰叫做“真理”，胡适可以强词夺理地否认帝国主义侵略和否认旧中国封建势力的存在，而对于马克思主义的科学真理，却采取了疯狂的反对态度。实用主义者捏造这种抹煞客观真伪标准的“真理”观，原来也正是为着要使它成为反动派用来抹煞革命真理，任意“涂抹”现实，任意捏造谎言这样一种“应付环境的工具”！
    这样，实用主义的主观唯心论的“真理”观，同时也是完全相对主义的。实用主义者既然把他们的“真理”看做只是人们一时公认的“应付环境”最方便的假设，因此就不承认“真理”的任何绝对的性质，而认为它是可以随着实用主义者以及实用主义者所拥护的反动派的主观的“公认”与否而随意改变的。胡适说：“没有绝对的真理，……我们人类所要的知识……乃是这个时间，这个境地，这个我的这个真理”〔十五〕，这就是说，实用主义者所谓的“真理”，是依赖着实用主义者的主观——“我”为转移的，“我”认为方便的才是真理，我认为不方便的，那怕是科学上证明了的千真万确的客观法则，“我”仍可以抹煞它的真理性。“我”可以依着我认为方便与否这一个主观标准来随意混淆黑白，颠倒是非，这就是实用主义者的相对主义“真理”观所必然要得到的逻辑上的结论。
    人类对于真理的认识有着相对性，这决不等于说认识内容的真伪可以随着人的主观意志和主观愿望为转移。真理的相对性是由于人们的认识所反映的客观事物本身的相对性，是由于客观事物是依着条件地点时间为转移的不断变化发展的事物。客观事物发展的一定阶段上的具体过程都是相对的，因此，“人们对于在各个一定发展阶段上的具体过程的认识只具有相对的真理性”〔十六〕，但是，第一，一定具体过程的认识的真理性虽然是相对的，但它之所以具有真理性，首先是由于它正确地反映了事物发展的客观过程，而并不是由于它是“我”认为方便的假设。真理与谬误决不是依“我”的主观为转移，而要看它是否反映了客观现实。是非真伪的标准永远是在客观方面，这一点却是绝对的，任何时候也不能动摇的，任何时候也不是主观唯心论——不可知论的实用主义者所能随便颠倒的。第二，真理的相对性既然是来源于它所反映的事物发展的具体过程的相对性，因此，这里的相对性的意义，只是说我们的认识应该跟着事物的发展而发展，不应该停顿在固定的一点上，如果满足于现有的知识成就，不知道跟着新鲜事物的出现而努力求取新的知识，或者把对于旧事物的认识当做死公式来硬套到新事物方面，我们的认识就不免一定要发生错误。真理的相对性，决不能解释成为我们可以在自己主观上认为不方便的时候就随便抹煞一种科学知识的真理性。一种科学知识只要是正确反映了事物发展的某一具体过程，它之符合于这一过程发展规律的客观真理性是任何时候也不容抹煞的。就这一点来说，它的真理性就具有绝对的性质。我们只能说当具体过程已发生变化时，这种科学知识对于新的过程就不能适用了，或者说应该把它补充、发展，就这一点来说，它的真理性才是相对的。因此，承认真理的相对性，决不等于说我们可以因为它在已经改变了的条件之下不适用，就能否认它之作为正确反映一定具体过程的客观真理，就能把已被实践证明具有客观真理意义的知识，又叫做谬误的东西。“真理变成谬误”〔十七〕这话的意思，只是说当我们错误地对待这些知识的时候，当我们把它当做死的公式乱套到不相适应的过程上的时候，就会在我们主观上造成自己的认识的错误，这里也不容许实用主义者来颠倒是非。第三，一定阶段上事物发展的具体过程虽然是相对的，但作为无数具体过程的总和的整个宇宙，却是绝对存在。人的认识发展也反映了这种客观情况：反映了一定具体过程的认识虽然只有相对的真理性，但无数相对真理的总和，就是反映总的宇宙的绝对真理。所以，与实用主义者的纯粹相对主义的谬论相反，世界上并不是只有相对真理，绝对真理也是存在的。相对真理中就具有着绝对的性质。反映一定具体过程的每一种相对真理，作为客观真理来说，它已经就是绝对的。并且它本身又是总的绝对真理的一个构成部分，在这一点上也具有绝对真理的性质。
    四、不是科学的进化论，是庸俗的进化论
    实用主义者用生物进化学说的名义作为自己的反科学思想的假面具。它把主观唯心论装扮成好像是符合于进化论学说的科学观点。它标榜着用进化论的原理来解释人类的生活。谁都知道人类社会生活有自己的特殊的发展规律，决不能简单地归结到生物界的进化规律之内，实用主义者这样做，是既曲解了人类生活，也曲解了生物进化学说。
    实用主义者把人的经验、知识、真理等等看做仅仅是“应付环境的工具”，硬说这就是应用了生物界适应环境的科学原理。这是对于人类知识和人类生活的一个极大的诬蔑！前面已经说过，人类的认识是客观现实的反映，科学知识反映着客观事物发展的内部规律性，人类掌握了正确的理论知识，掌握了科学真理，就能预见周围事变发展的前途，就能使自己的实践行动成为有目的有意识的自觉的行动，就能使自己的斗争——生产斗争，革命运动等等——战无不胜。决不能说人类的行动都是动物式的没有理性头脑的清醒指导的“应付环境”的活动，决不能说人类的认识、科学真理等只是这种盲目地“应付环境的工具”。实用主义者把人类的认识看做“应付环境的工具”，这仅只是反映了实用主义者自己本身的思想和生活的腐朽性和反动性。如果就胡适一流的实用主义者及其所拥护的反动派的思想和生活来看，那倒可以说是有某些方面和动物类似的。历史发展规律注定了一切反动派要走向灭亡，他们不敢正面认识，因此也就不敢承认周围事变的客观规律，他们所能做的事情就是盲目的垂死的挣扎。因此他们需要寻求任何可以帮助他们苟延残喘的“应付环境的工具”，而实用主义者就替他们谋算起来，说可以把“经验”，“知识”等等也当成这样的工具，于是他们就在这样的目的之下捏造了一套不可知论的—主观唯心论的谬论。就其“应付”的盲目性这一点来说，反动派的生活情形和实用主义者的说教，确实具有着动物式的特点，但这与广大进步人类的生活和思想是完全不相干的。并且，动物适应环境的生存运动，是要改变自己的有机体的性质来适应自然界的一定的客观条件的变化。也就是自发地依循着一定的客观发展规律的。生物的适应环境的行为，并没有包含着实用主义者的那种主观唯心论的妄想，并没有丝毫想要把“实在”当做可以任意“涂抹”和“装扮”的“很服从的女孩子”的企图。但实用主义者谈到“应付环境”的时候，却是抱着极端狂妄的主观唯心论幻想的。杜威说：“生活的进行全在能管理环境。生活的活动必须把周围的变迁一一变换过；必须使有害的势力变成无害的势力；必须使无害的势力变成帮助我们的势力”〔十八〕，反动派已经日愈走向垮台，但它还要用一切卑鄙无耻的手段、办法和“工具”，来进行盲目的疯狂挣扎，妄想按照自己的主观目的来任意把“周围的变迁一一变换过”，以图苟延它的“管理环境”的统治地位，这就是实用主义者所谓“应付环境”的真正意义！实用主义者把生物进化论里“适应环境”的概念偷来作为自己的招牌，实际上生物适应环境的进化规律和实用主义者“应付环境”的主观幻想，是根本不相干的。
    胡适散布“一点一滴的进化”，“一点一滴的改造”的谬论，否认“根本的解决”〔十九〕，并把这也假装作科学的进化论的思想，人们知道，胡适的这种臭名昭著的谬论，是在五四运动以后不久，中国的先进人物开始接受了马克思主义思想，中国人民反对帝国主义和北洋军阀封建统治的运动高涨起来的时候散布出来的。历史早已证明，在旧中国那种极端残暴腐朽的反动派统治下面，不进行革命斗争，就不可能使历史前进，在那样的情形下面，口头上讲一点一滴的进化，反对根本的解决，就是在实际上一点一滴也不要解决；就是实际上根本不要进步。胡适自己的全部行动，都足以证明这种庸俗进化论思想的反动性和虚伪性。
    人类社会历史包含着阶级斗争和革命变革的运动，生物界的进化过程里则不存在这些运动形式，所以决不能把生物进化的规律用来解释人类社会的运动。并且，生物的种类变化也是一种飞跃性质的根本变化，虽然这种飞跃是采取逐渐过渡的形式，但究竟不能仅仅归结为“一点一滴的进化”。所以实用主义者在这里也曲解了生物进化规律，它所宣传的并不是真正科学的进化论思想，而只是一种庸俗进化论的谬误观点。
    胡适所散布的庸俗进化论思想和真正的科学的进化论还有一个根本不同的特点，就是科学的进化论证明了生物界的运动发展有着一定的必然的客观规律，而胡适的庸俗进化论则把发展看成一大堆没有任何秩序的事件的偶然凑合。胡适曾把个人的偶然行为的作用加以极度的夸大，想借此来淹没历史发展的必然规律。他说，一个人“吐一口痰在地上，也许可以毁灭一村一族。他起一个念头，也许可以引起几十年的血战。他也许‘一言可以兴邦，一言可以丧邦’。善亦不朽，恶亦不朽；功盖万世固然不朽，种一担谷子也可以不朽，喝一杯酒，吐一口痰也可以不朽”〔二十〕。很容易明白，这种偶然性崇拜的反科学观点，也是主观唯心论—不可知论的一种表现形式。主观唯心论否认了物质世界及其发展规律的客观实在性，就不能不把一切事物及其变化过程都看做偶然的东西。这种唯心论的狂妄胡说是经不起一点认真的驳斥的。客观事物的发展过程虽然不断地受到偶然因素的影响，但支配发展过程的东西究竟是必然的规律，偶然因素所引起的任何偏差终归要被必然的大潮流所淹没。不要说吐一口痰和喝一杯酒不会有任何“不朽”的作用，就是像胡适那样以个人毕生的力量来帮助反动派欺骗人民反对革命的活动，因为违反了中国社会和中国革命发展的必然规律，结果还是要被革命人民所粉碎，就是现在还遗留的一些思想上的有毒影响，也终归要被人民清除得一干二净的。实用主义者的这种崇拜偶然性的荒谬观点在事实前面根本站不住脚。实用主义者散布这种胡说的作用，无非是妄想借此来否认自然和社会发展过程中必然规律的存在，否认阶级矛盾、新旧事物矛盾及其诸方面的斗争是自然和社会发展的根本内容和源泉，也就是妄想借此来反对科学规律知识，反对马克思主义的革命思想和广大人民的革命运动，另一方面，这又不过是反映着接近灭亡的反动派希图依赖什么偶然奇迹来侥幸得救的这种盲目挣扎的绝望心理罢了。
    五、不是科学方法，是主观唯心论者“应付环境”的方法
    实用主义对于许多知识分子和学术界人士的迷惑作用特别在于方法方面。实用主义者以“实验室的态度”作为标榜，而把自己的方法伪装得最像科学的。许多受迷惑的人把这种伪装误认为就是它的实质。其实，实用主义的方法根本不是能够帮助我们发现事物发展的客观规律性的真正科学的方法，它实际上是主观唯心论的虚构事实的方法，是帮助反动派“应付环境”进行垂死挣扎的方法。
    实用主义的方法仅仅在形式方面好像是科学的。胡适把这个形式概括为三个部分或三个步骤：“（一）从具体的事实与境地下手；（二）一切学说理想，一切知识，都只是待证的假设，并非天经地义；（三）一切学说与理想都须用实行来试验过；实验是真理的唯一试金石”〔二十一〕，有时他把这形式写得更简单一点，那就是：“细心搜求事实，大胆提出假设，再细心求证实。”〔二十二〕这样的形式很容易和真正科学的方法相混同，如果我们单只注意到它的形式，就难免要受到迷惑。要揭露实用主义的方法的反科学性，必须把它的形式和它的主观唯心论的内容联系起来进行批判，才能达到目的。
    先说实用主义方法的所谓第一步，即“从具体的事实与境地下手”，或“细心搜求事实”。这里的反科学性在什么地方呢？这就在于实用主义者所标榜要搜集的“事实”，并不是真正科学研究开始时所要求的事实。科学的研究首先需要有正确的科学的思想方法作为向导，不容许没头没脑地向“事实”里乱钻。这里所说的思想方法，就是马克思主义的普遍原理——辩证唯物论和历史唯物论。在这个科学的思想方法的指导下，科学的研究首先要求我们“从客观存在着的实际事物出发”，要求在开始研究以前要“详细地占有材料”〔二十三〕这就是说，我们一开始的时候就应该严格地遵守着唯物论的原则，要着眼在“客观存在着的实际事物”和“详细地占有材料”上面，不能有丝毫主观随意性掺杂在中间，这与实用主义者泛泛地讲到的所谓“从具体事实与境地下手”与“细心搜求事实”有原则的不同。客观存在着的实际事物决不是一个一个孤立的，而是互相有机地联系着的，实际事物中间有主要与次要之别，有根本的东西与非根本的东西的区别，科学的研究就必须依据着这种客观存在的事实，一方面要详细占有丰富的材料，另一方面又一定要把主要的注意力放在一些根本事实方面，以此作为分析和贯串一切事实材料的核心。例如历史唯物论告诉我们，人类社会生活中最根本的实际事物是生产和阶级斗争，因此在着手研究人类社会的问题时，就必须把主要注意力放在生产和阶级斗争这些根本事实方面，必须把阶级矛盾的分析研究作为研究的中心环节。例如研究历史，就必须以历史上的生产发展情况和阶级斗争的情况作为研究的中心环节，而不应该把地理、人口以及思想文化条件作为中心环节（虽然这些也是应该研究的），研究古典文学（例如红楼梦），必须把重点放在作品的阶级背景和阶级内容的分析上，而不应该像胡适那样放在作者、本子上等次要的事实上（虽然这些事实的研究也是必需的），只有这样来着手研究，才可以希望完成科学的研究所要求的任务。只有把出发点布置得正确了，然后向前面去才不至于走错路。
    说到实用主义者所谓的“事实”和“境地”时，我们不要忘记实用主义者把“实在”看做人的感觉，感觉之间的关系等主观要素的复合，看做“百依百顺”任人“涂抹”“装扮”的“很服从的女孩子”，看做一大堆没有秩序的偶然事件的凑合。这些唯心论观点在科学前面是完全站不住脚的，但实用主义者的研究方法的思想基础，却正是这些主观唯心论的谬误观点。当实用主义者说到“细心搜求事实”的时候，他们不是严格按照“客观存在着的实际事物”来“详细地占有材料”，而是依照主观的“兴趣和意志定下选择的目标”，依照偶然的“疑难的境地”〔二十四〕来提出问题和着手研究的。他们决不肯依照“客观存在着的实际事物”本身的秩序，把研究的注意力放在某些根本事实上，相反地却凭着自己的主观的“兴趣和意志”把一些次要的事实和问题作为研究的重点。所以，胡适把古典文学的作者、本事的考据作为研究的主要目标，而把作品的社会背景和阶级内容根本撇开不谈。俞平伯先生的“红楼梦”研究也凭着主观的偶然兴趣在怡红院的姑娘们排座次等类枝节的问题上花费了极大的力量。这样的研究结果最多只能在材料校勘性质的工作上——例如一个字的意义或一本书的作者上做出一点成绩，而对于事物的本身则越闹越糊涂，不能够认清它的本质和规律。至于胡适把中国社会混乱的原因归之于自己闹“五鬼”——“贫穷、疾病、愚昧、贪污、扰乱”〔二十五〕，而抹煞了帝国主义的侵略和封建势力的存在这些根本原因，这更足以暴露实用主义者“搜求事实”的方法并不是“从客观存在着的实际事物出发”，而只是依据着支持反动派这个主观的目的来任意罗织事实吧了。
    现在再说第二步——假设的问题。科学的研究常常要经过假设的阶段；当我们对事实材料已经作了某种程度的分析研究，从这里初步归结出一些理论原理原则来，但还没有能够最后确定它是否完全符合于事物发展的客观规律性时，我们就把这些原理原则看作待证的假设。要等到再进一步经过实践的检验，证明它确是正确地反映了事物发展的客观规律性时，才把它肯定作具有完全的客观真理性的科学规律。科学的假设经过实践的检验而被修改或补充，甚至于根本改造过来，这种情形也是常有的。但是，科学的假设虽然还不是最后确定的客观真理，但它是人们通过科学的研究来认识客观真理的一个步骤，所以，科学家就必须力求使自己的研究所作出的假设尽可能地与客观真理相一致，力求尽可能地使它经得起实践的考验。因此在制定假设的时候，第一，就必须以丰富的事实材料作基础，特别是要能够掌握最主要最根本的事实。没有丰富的事实材料或没有抓着根本的事实，而只依靠一些枝节的事实，就不能按照尽可能正确反映客观事物规律性这个目标来做出假设。没有阶级斗争的事实材料，就不可能在社会历史的研究方面作出尽可能与客观真理相一致的假设。第二，在作假设的时候，必须小心谨慎，实事求是，极力避免主观主义的因素。必须在科学的思想方法的指导之下，细心地分析事实材料中所显示着的事物各方面的具体矛盾运动，如在社会历史的研究上必须细心地分析生产力与生产关系的矛盾以及阶级的矛盾运动等等。所以，制定科学的假设，必须以谨严为原则，而不应该以“大胆”为原则。实用主义者胡适标榜“大胆的假设”，这不是科学的方法，而只是主观唯心论的方法。主观唯心论者——实用主义者在研究问题的时候，他们的目的是在于要依着主观的“兴趣和意志定下”的“选择的目标”，来找到某种“应付环境的工具”，他们本来不敢面对客观真理，所以就不得不做出种种“大胆的假设”，也不怕这些“大胆的假设”终归要成为骗人的“大胆”的虚构或“大胆”的武断。胡适为了帮助反动派满足“应付”人民革命运动的目的，不惜武断说帝国主义者也希望中国的统一与和平，并没有侵略中国。他武断到如此不要脸的程度，以至于连当时拥护他的主张的梁溟漱也替他担心，并写信给他表示恐怕这些胡说连“三尺童子”也骗不了〔二十六〕。在这里，“大胆的假设”与科学研究的方法根本没有关系，它只是帮助反动派虚构了一些无耻的谎言。
    认清楚了实用主义者的“大胆的假设”是怎么一回事，也就可以明白他们是怎样“求证”的了。科学的假设必须经得起实践——生产斗争、阶级斗争和科学实验等——的检验。胡适的实用主义方法所做出来的“假设”除了某些个别的事实材料考据之外，常常是一些主观的虚构或主观的武断，这样的假设，当然是经不起实践——首先是生产斗争和阶级斗争的实践的检验的。在这样的情形之下，实用主义者口口声声所谓的“细心求证实”，当然并不是表示敢于依照科学的要求，把自己的言论拿到实践的前面来求证明，而只是说要“细心”地按照自己的主观需要，拉扯一些表面现象，来掩饰自己的谎言。我们知道，任何一种谎言，如果需要掩饰，多少都可以找到一些足以用来掩饰的表面事实的。胡适可以拉一篇帝国主义者的表面上冠冕堂皇的宣言，来“证实”帝国主义者也希望中国和平与统一，可以把美国在中国办的利用来作欺骗和侵略工具的教会、学校、医院等等，作为帝国主义不要侵略中国的“证据”。这里，实用主义者的主观唯心论又起了方法的作用：这种反动哲学观点要我们相信“实在”就是感觉，相信一个一个的表面现象就是一切，要我们只看见表面现象而忘记了或不要看见最根本的事实或事情的本质。实用主义者所谓的“细心求证实”，原来又可以解释为用表面现象来掩盖事情的本质的意思！很显然，真正科学方法对于认识的客观真理性所要求的实践的检验，决不是这种骗人的东西！
