    My Sneakers Are Stuck! To the Editor:
    On September 26th of last year, I went out wearing a pair of newly bought sneakers. While walking, I constantly felt something sticky under my feet. After returning home, I wanted to take off my shoes to see what was causing it, but after untying the shoelaces, I couldn't pull my foot out! Later, I used a great deal of strength to finally get my foot out, but my sock was stuck to the sole of the shoe. I used even more force to remove the sock, and when I looked, alas, there was a puddle of "slimy" stuff inside the shoe – the sponge sole had melted!
    I bought these sneakers from the Lushun City Department Store. They were produced by the Rehe Province Local State-Owned Huasheng Rubber Factory, with the trademark "Su Xin".

    球鞋脱不掉了编辑同志：
    去年九月二十六日，我穿了一双新买的球鞋上街去。走在路上，老觉得脚下粘糊糊的。回家后我想脱下鞋来看一看是什么原因，不料解开鞋带后脚却拔不出来啦。后来，我用了很大的力气，才把脚拔出来了，可是袜子却黏在鞋底上了。再用力地把袜子拿出来，一看，哎呀，鞋子底里一摊“稀溜”的东西——原来海绵底已经融化了。
    这双球鞋是从旅顺市百货公司买来的，是热河省地方国营华胜橡胶厂出品，商标是“苏新”牌。
