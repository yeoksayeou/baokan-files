Enrolling in the Cooperative

The Weizhuang Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Daren County, Shanxi Province, had been operating for two years by the winter of 1953. Hearing that the cooperative was going to expand again, the villagers were arguing about joining, and the middle peasant Sun Shengye had more worries. He had a lot of land, one of the most in the village; he also had a tawny mule, a large castrated ox; and he and his younger brother were two able-bodied workers. Although he had a lot of land, he had livestock and labor, so without joining the cooperative, he could harvest at least thirty-odd *shi* of grain a year; and in the winter, he could earn a lot of money hauling coal to the coal kiln with his livestock. However, he also remembered the letter from his son who had joined the People's Liberation Army, encouraging him to join the agricultural production cooperative. He thought, "I didn't join before, but if I don't join now, won't people say I'm backward? Besides, everyone else is walking on the bridge, can I walk under it?"

That evening, the cooperative held a mass meeting to sign up for membership. The office of the agricultural production cooperative was as noisy as a hornet's nest. From the chaotic sounds, one could clearly hear: "Sign me up!" "Register me too!" He also clearly heard the cooperative chairman Ge Youqian asking Sun Shangye: "How is your mother?" Followed by the reply: "My mother's problem is easy to solve, she has no objections." These words flew into Old Sun's brain, as if a handful of weeds had stuffed his heart, and he leaned against the corner of the wall without saying a word. Seeing everyone's enthusiastic energy, he also mustered up courage. Just as he was about to sign up, he suddenly thought of his tawny mule and large castrated ox, and he squatted down again. He blamed himself, he couldn't be so rash. Thinking and thinking, while everyone was gathered there signing up, not paying attention to him, he turned around and left.

The winter night was exceptionally clear, the moon hanging high in the sky, shining on the window of the livestock pen. In the bright moonlight, one could clearly see that his tawny mule, which he had raised for more than ten years, was turned silver-gray by the moonlight, looking particularly beautiful. Old Sun dug up half a *sheng* of feed at home, sat on the edge of the trough and scattered it to the mule; eating a handful, scattering a handful. The old ox on the side used its horns to bump the mule's chest, and Old Sun casually scattered a handful to the old ox as well.

The night was already very late, he returned to the house, tossing and turning, unable to fall asleep all night. He thought over the matter from beginning to end. Since liberation, his life had been pretty good, with some surplus every year besides what he ate and used; this, in his view, was more than satisfactory. But when he thought about the cooperative, his heart churned. The rooster crowed twice, his wife woke up, and asked Old Sun about joining the cooperative. His wife was even more unwilling to let him join the cooperative, saying things that would hold him back, and suggesting that Old Sun go to his brother-in-law in Yangzhuang to inquire about the situation. Old Sun had originally planned to do this as well. As soon as it was light, he got up and ran to his brother-in-law Baldy Hei's place.

Baldy Hei had already joined the cooperative, and the cooperative was evaluating his livestock for rent. Old Sun arrived at Baldy Hei's place, not caring to say anything else, and immediately inquired about the cooperative in Yangzhuang. Baldy Hei told him about the village's cooperative and the reasons for his joining from beginning to end. Old Sun paid special attention to how land and livestock were entered into the cooperative, and calculated a bit; the land rent, after paying public grain, still had a surplus, and a livestock entered into the cooperative, raised by the cooperative, could bring in twenty-odd yuan in rent a year. Besides, there was labor income, needless to say. Old Sun and Baldy Hei calculated again, Old Sun's mule could get 300,000 yuan in rent a year, and the ox rent could get more than 200,000 yuan, which wasn't bad either. Old Sun also saw that Baldy Hei was so comfortable and at ease after joining the cooperative, and his heart was moved.

When the sun came out as high as a pole, Old Sun returned from Yangzhuang, and without going home, ran to find the cooperative chairman to request joining the cooperative.

Cooperative Chairman Ge Youqian welcomed Old Sun's request to join the cooperative; but because Old Sun had always been hesitant about joining, he specifically instructed Old Sun to consider it carefully, and to discuss it with the elders.

Old Sun said: "My own business, I make the decisions myself, I'm over forty years old, can't I manage my own family affairs?" He firmly demanded to join the cooperative.

The cooperative chairman saw that Old Sun was very determined, and agreed to his request.

Withdrawing Halfway

Sun Shengye's father, Old Man Sun Yi, had been feeling uneasy these days, hearing his son talking about joining the cooperative. He was a semi-disabled person (leg pain), and he didn't quite agree with joining the cooperative. Whenever Old Man Sun mentioned joining the cooperative, he would always mutter: "I've lived sixty-six years, and I've been raising this mule since I was in my fifties, for more than ten years now, it's never lost its temper, it's strong and docile, really like a good young man..."

Old Man Sun couldn't do other work, when the livestock grazed, he would always lead the tawny mule and old castrated ox alone, looking for water and grass everywhere; when the livestock did heavy work, he would feed them ears of grain. Old Man Sun believed that it earned back its share of the year's labor. The mule's buttocks were eaten flat, its back was like a chopping board, its neck was almost half a foot thick, and its fur was so smooth that flies could hardly stand on it.

The livestock had already been entered into the cooperative for rent, the mule for 300,000 yuan, the ox for 270,000 yuan. The livestock of other new cooperative members had already been pulled into the cooperative. The cooperative asked Old Sun to pull his livestock in as well, so they could plan to deliver manure. Although Old Sun had signed up to join the cooperative, he was always unwilling to pull in the livestock.

Old Sun had another worry: he planned that after joining the cooperative, he would keep the ten *mu* of good wheat stubble land called "Shi Family Land," and if the cooperative didn't take it, his whole family could make do for half a year.

When the cooperative discussed retaining private plots, Old Sun firmly wanted to keep those ten *mu* of good wheat stubble land.

Cooperative Chairman Ge Youqian patiently explained to him: Keeping so much private plot, you'll be too busy, you'll take care of the cooperative but not the private plot, you'll take care of the private plot but not the cooperative. As a cooperative member, you must "put the cooperative first, yourself second," if you don't do this, it will not only affect the cooperative's collective production, but your private plot will also not be cultivated well. Besides, the agricultural production cooperative is land as shares, collective labor, good land into the cooperative also means more income, more labor in the cooperative also means more labor income...

After much talking, Old Sun always had his own old ideas. They had to put it aside temporarily and evaluate others.

Old Sun felt as if he were dumplings in a pot of boiling water these days. Sun Yi heard that his son had entered the livestock into the cooperative for rent, and nagged even more severely. As soon as he picked up his rice bowl at home, his wife also nagged. Old Sun felt as if he were holding a hedgehog in both hands, unable to shake it off, unable to put it down, and was worried: he couldn't bear to part with the mule, but gritted his teeth and joined the cooperative; he wanted to keep ten *mu* of good wheat stubble land, but they wouldn't let him!

These days, whenever Old Sun had time, he liked to sit on the sunny slope of the river beach with Old Man Zhao Dengshan, Li Cai, and Sun Pigui, who hadn't joined the cooperative, and chat about the agricultural production cooperative.

Old Man Zhao Dengshan and Old Sun suffered from the same ailment, because they had a mare with a foal, they had not joined the cooperative, and Old Sun could talk to him the most.

Old Man Zhao Dengshan lamented: San Fo, Sun Shanggong, these poor peasants joined the cooperative, they have nothing. He also said: "The agricultural cooperative has bones but no meat."

Li Cai also murmured: I have a mule and a donkey, besides working the crops, I can also haul coal to the coal kiln when I have time.

At this time, Old Sun put his hands in his sleeves and counted on his fingers. Counting back and forth, there were ten households in the village that raised mules and horses, only Ge Youyu followed his brother (the cooperative chairman) and joined the cooperative; counting again, there were fifty households in the cooperative now, and at least twenty households were in difficulty. Zhao Dengshan and Li Cai haven't joined yet, what am I in a hurry for? They won't even let me keep ten *mu* of good wheat stubble land! I should make up my mind to withdraw from the cooperative as soon as possible!

Party Branch Secretary Wei Wenjin and Cooperative Chairman Ge Youqian heard that Old Sun wanted to withdraw from the cooperative again, and came to talk to him again about the benefits of joining the cooperative.

The branch secretary and the cooperative chairman talked for a long time, and Old Sun said a few words for a long time: "The old man won't let me join, and the woman is also causing trouble, I can't clap with one hand! Even if I join the cooperative alone, with several worries in the family, how can I settle down to produce?"

Seeing that Old Sun had made up his mind to withdraw from the cooperative, the cooperative chairman told him: You can wait a little longer, you can join a mutual aid team first.

Old Sun did not join the mutual aid team, and continued to work on his own as before.

Good and Bad Clearly Distinguished

As soon as it was light, the bell of the agricultural production cooperative rang, clang, clang. Early in the morning, the men, women, old, and young of Weizhuang Village were in an uproar. A team of young people carried five brand-new new-style walking plows, driving cattle up the mountain. A young man said: Now we are completely using new-style walking plows, and later we should use double-wheeled double-share plows. A young man disagreed and said: I'm still waiting to drive a tractor! The young girls, old men, and old women carried hoes, shovels, and rakes, each heading to different production posts. In the old society, the village was surrounded by barren mountains and slopes, with only a few pitiful trees. Last year, the cooperative planted 70 *mu* of apricot trees and 15 *mu* of willow trees. The shepherd boys, early in the morning, went from house to house driving the sheep to the sheep farm to trample manure. In the old society, only a few landlords and rich peasants raised sheep, and few peasants raised sheep; now, there are three large flocks of more than 600 sheep in the village, with an average of seven sheep per household; even the poor households have started raising sheep after joining the cooperative.

Last year, it rained every other day; there was a lot of rain and lush grass, and there was little time to go to the ground, which was too unlucky for Old Sun.

It hadn't rained for a few days, and the cooperative's bell rang even earlier. The men, women, old, and young of the cooperative, worked day and night, launching a general mobilization to rush to weed the seedlings. In a few days, the cooperative's two hundred *mu* of millet had been weeded twice. After weeding the crops, the cooperative also sent people to work in the coal mines, build roads and plant trees for the country, and also burned lime for sideline production, earning back a total of more than 19 million yuan.

Old Sun was worried these days. In the past, he would get up as soon as he heard the cooperative's bell, but these days he was really struggling. The two brothers worked early and late, but the ten *mu* of millet in "Shi Family Land" hadn't even been weeded once, while the cooperative's millet next to it had been weeded twice. The cooperative's millet was planted on millet stubble, while his millet was planted on wheat stubble (wheat stubble land is better than millet stubble land), when the seedlings first came up, Old Sun saw that his millet seedlings were more robust than the cooperative's, and secretly rejoiced: "If I had joined the cooperative, the loss would have been immeasurable." After a few rains, the cooperative rushed to weed it twice as soon as the weather cleared; but Old Sun and his brother couldn't weed it no matter how hard they tried, the seedlings were left uneven, and the weeds in the field grew more luxuriantly than the millet seedlings! At this time, Old Sun looked at the cooperative's millet and breathed a sigh of relief.

Those days, Old Sun didn't let his fifteen-year-old son Sun Mao go to school, and finally he had a "Yang Family General on the battlefield" - the whole family was dispatched. In a few days, the old and the children were all "burnt out," the child had blisters all over his hands, and the old man said his back hurt, and no one went. The two brothers weeded slowly and carefully, but the seedlings were still left unweeded.

Old Man Sun Yi gave his son an idea: Hire some people.

Hire people! Old Sun thought about it, this was possible before the mutual aid teams were set up a few years ago, but it has been difficult to hire people since the mutual aid teams were established in 1951. With the agricultural cooperative, it is even more difficult to hire people. Wei Shan, Sun Shanggong, Zhao Changfu, and the twenty-odd households who used to work as hired laborers have all joined the cooperative, where can you hire people? Those who are outside the cooperative now are still thinking about hiring people! Isn't Old Man Zhao Dengshan's more than ten *mu* of millet left unweeded because he couldn't hire anyone?

Rejoining the Cooperative

The crops turned yellow. Before the harvest, the agricultural production cooperative first estimated the yield and made a pre-distribution plan. The cooperative invited several mutual aid team leaders and individual farmers to participate in the yield estimation, and also invited Old Sun. They followed the river ditch and first went to "Shi Family Land" to visit the cooperative's millet. When Old Sun heard that they were going to "Shi Family Land," he thought of his ten *mu* of wheat stubble land, and prayed in advance: Don't look at my ten *mu* of wheat stubble land when you go there. The cooperative's millet, piece after piece, although it suffered from flooding, because it was plowed deep with new-style walking plows, with a lot of fertilizer, and frequent weeding, the yield reduction was not large; everyone estimated that each *mu* could yield an average of seven *dou*, about the same as the year before. "The cooperative's millet stubble millet yields seven *dou*, how much should my wheat stubble millet yield?" Old Sun's mind was churning again about his ten *mu* of wheat stubble millet, which looked like a malnourished child, uneven in height, thick in one place, thin in another, some places the weeds grew more luxuriantly than the seedlings, the ears facing the sky, swaying in the wind, really embarrassing Old Sun. The cooperative chairman turned around, stood on the edge of the field, and pointed at Old Sun's millet, saying: "How much do you estimate this piece of land can yield per *mu*?" Mutual Aid Team Leader Guo Lian said: "Old Sun's piece of land has the same field survey and yield assessment as the cooperative's, and it is still wheat stubble, so in theory it should yield more, but I see that it can yield at most four *dou*." Old Sun blushed to the roots of his neck at this time. He thought over and over about the things before and after joining the cooperative, blaming himself: He shouldn't have withdrawn from the cooperative after joining! If he wanted to join the cooperative now, he was afraid that they wouldn't want him? His thoughts struggled again.

A few days later, the county asked the village to send someone to visit the Qiaomai Chuan Agricultural Cooperative in Hunyuan County and the Xiling Village in Yanggao to see the mountain area's water and soil conservation and the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. The village decided to let Old Sun go.

At the county, the County Party Committee's Rural Work Department first introduced the benefits of the Chenjiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative using double-wheeled double-share plows this year. At this time, he thought: No matter how good my tawny mule is, one mule alone can't pull a double-share plow! Besides, how can individual households have the strength to use double-share plows! When he arrived at the special district, he listened carefully to Qiaomai Chuan carrying out mountain construction since the establishment of the cooperative, and the agricultural production cooperative being able to turn "poor gullies into rich gullies" and "barren mountains into lush forests." Old Sun thought, if he worked on his own, he wouldn't be able to do these things even in his dreams. He originally thought: Our Weizhuang has barren mountains and slopes, we only plant some gravel land and harvest some grain to make a living, that's enough; anyway, tractors can't go up the mountain. He listened to the description of Qiaomai Chuan's vision of building the mountain area, and saw with his own eyes the peasants in Xiling Village, Yanggao, organized to plant trees and turn barren mountains into lush forests. He also thought, hasn't Weizhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative also started planting trees and fruit trees? Recently, he also heard that the cooperative is going to collectively manage the sheep flock. If Weizhuang becomes like Qiaomai Chuan, and all the peasants in the village join the cooperative, what will it become like in five years? As soon as he thought of this, Old Sun thought of his own hardships in working on his own. "Everyone else is walking on the socialist road, but I'm blindly unaware of where I'm going!" After the visit, representatives from various places discussed how to change the face of their mountain areas after returning. Some planned to carry out water and soil conservation, build terraced fields, and build earth dams, some wanted to develop animal husbandry, and some wanted to plant trees, everyone had a "plan" for building the mountain area. Old Sun was also thinking in his heart: How can Weizhuang Village be changed to be like Qiaomai Chuan and Xiling Village? He also had a "plan." But he thought that most of the people in the village had joined the cooperative, but he was still working on his own. Therefore, his "plan" was only stored in his stomach, and he was embarrassed to say it in front of everyone.

Old Sun came back from the visit, without even going home, he went to find the cooperative chairman to request joining the cooperative. Sun Shanggong and Zhao Changfu, who were sitting aside, saw that Old Sun came in and requested to join the cooperative without saying a word, and thought secretly: Old Sun's visit really solved his ideological problems. Zhao Changfu asked Old Sun with a smile: "How can you give up your tawny mule and ten *mu* of wheat stubble land?" Old Sun blushed at first, but seeing that Old Zhao was joking to join in the fun, he smiled and said: "Don't mention that again. Not joining the cooperative the year before last was a small disappointment, not joining the cooperative last year was a big disappointment. If I don't join the cooperative now, the disappointment will be so great that I won't even be able to keep my eyebrows."

    一头土黄骡子和十亩麦茬地
    李廷选
    报名入社
    山西省大仁县魏庄村农业生产合作社，到一九五三年冬天已经办了两年了。听说社又要扩大，那几天村里人吵着入社的事，中农孙生业的心事又多了。他的地多，在村里是数一数二的；还有一头土黄骡子，一头大犍牛；家里有他和弟弟两个整劳动力。虽说土地多，可是自己既有牲口，又有劳力，不入社，一年最少也能收三十多石粮食；冬天赶上牲口上煤窑驮炭，又能赚许多钱。可是，又想起参加人民解放军的儿子给他来的信，鼓励他参加农业生产合作社。他想：“以前咱没入，现在再不入，不叫人说咱落后？再说，人家都走桥上，咱能走桥下？”
    晚上社里召开报名入社的群众大会。农业生产合作社的办公室里吵的和一窝蜂一样。从乱糟糟的声音里，分明听得清楚：“给咱报个名！”“给咱也登记上！”还清清楚楚地听到社长戈有谦问孙尚业：“你妈怎样？”随着是回答的声音：“我妈的问题好说，没啥意见。”这声音一字一句地都飞到老孙的脑子里，他好像一把乱草塞住了心一样，靠在墙角落里一声也不吭。他看到大家那个热火朝天的劲儿，也鼓起了勇气。他正想报名，忽然想起了他的土黄骡子、大犍牛，就又蹲下来了。自己责备自己，做事不能这么冒失。想着想着，趁大家围在那里报名，不注意他，扯转屁股就走了。
    冬天的深夜，天气分外晴朗，天空高挂着月亮，照映在牲口圈的窗子上。在明朗的月光下，分明看清楚，他养活了十几年的土黄骡子，被月光照的变成了银灰色，显得分外漂亮。老孙到家里挖了半升料，坐在槽头上给骡子撒；吃一把，撒一把。老犍牛在一边用犄角去顶骡子的前胸，老孙随手给老犍牛也撒了一把。
    夜已经很深了，他回到屋里，翻过来，转过去，一夜没有入睡。他把前前后后的事情，想了个遍。从解放以后，他的生活一直过的挺好，每年除了吃用还有剩余；这事在他看来，是再满足不过了。但想到现在办社的事，他的心就翻腾起来了。鸡叫两遍，老婆醒来了，问老孙入社的事情。老婆更不愿意叫他入社，说了些拉腿的话，还建议老孙到杨庄他妹夫那里打听打听动静。老孙原来也是打算这样办的。天才麻麻亮，他爬起身来就跑到他妹夫秃黑子那里去了。
    秃黑子已经入社了，社里正在评议他的牲口作租。老孙到秃黑子那里，别的啥也没顾的说，开头就打听杨庄办社的事情。秃黑子从头到尾，把村里办社的事和他入社的情由说了一遍。说到土地、牲口咋入社，老孙分外注意，还合计了一下，地租除了缴公粮还有余，一个牲口入社，由社里喂养，一年租子干落个二十来万元。此外，劳动收入，就不用说了。老孙和秃黑子又合计了一下，老孙一头骡子，租额一年可得到三十万元，牛租能得到二十多万元，这也挺不赖。老孙又看到秃黑子入社后，那么如意自在，心里也动了。
    日头出来一竿子高，老孙从杨庄回来了，连家没顾的回，就跑去找着社长要求入社。
    社长戈有谦对老孙要求入社是表示欢迎的；但是，因为老孙老是对入社表示犹豫，就特意叮嘱老孙要慎重地考虑考虑，并让他和老人们商量商量。
    老孙说：“自己的事，自己主张，我四十多岁的人了，难道主不了个家务事？”他坚决要求入社。
    社长看老孙很坚决，就答应了他的要求。
    半路退社
    孙生业的父亲孙义老汉这几天听到儿子张罗着入社的事情，心里也七上八下的。他是个半残废人
  （腿痛），对入社的事情也有些不大同意。老汉一提起入社，总是数念着：“我活了六十六岁，打五十多岁上就养活着这头骡子，到现在已经十几年了，它从没发过个脾气，使唤起来力气大，又厚和，真和个好后生一样。……”
    老汉别的营生不能干，牲口放青时，他总是一个人牵着土黄骡子、老犍牛，到处寻水草；牲口做的活重了，就喂谷穗子。老汉认为，一年的劳动果实，也有它挣回来的一份儿。他这骡子屁股吃的平坦坦的，脊背和案板一样，脖颈差不多有半尺厚，身上光的苍蝇爬上去也难站住脚。
    牲口已经作租入社了，骡子作租三十万元，牛作租二十七万元。别的新社员的牲口已经拉到社里了。社里让老孙也把牲口拉进去，好计划着送粪。老孙虽然报名入社了，可是总不愿意拉牲口。
    老孙还有一个心事：打算着入了社，自己留下名叫“施家地”的十亩好麦茬地，社里不收，全家人也能顾半年生活。
    社里讨论留自留地的时候，老孙坚决要留那十亩好麦茬地。
    社长戈有谦耐心地对他解释说：留那么多的自留地，你会忙不过来，顾了社顾不了自留地，顾了自留地顾不了社。以一个社员来说，就得“先社后自己”，要不这么办，不但要影响社里的集体生产，就是你的自留地也作务不好。再说，农业生产合作社是土地入股，集体劳动，好地入社收入也多，多在社里做活劳动收入也多。……
    千说万讲，老孙总有他的老主意。只好暂时搁起来，评别人的。
    老孙这几天心里好像滚水锅里下饺子似的。孙义听说儿子把牲口作租入社了，唠叨得更厉害了。到家一端起饭碗，老婆也唠叨。弄的老孙好像双手捧着个刺猬，甩不了，丢不下，发了愁：舍不下的骡子，硬咬住牙入了社；想留十亩好麦茬地，也不让留！
    老孙这几天一有空，总爱和没入社的赵登山老汉、李财、孙丕贵他们坐在河滩的阳坡里啦哒着农业生产合作社的事情。
    赵登山老汉和老孙是害一个心病，因为有个怀驹的马，所以没有入社，老孙和他最能说上话。
    赵登山老汉啦哒起：三佛、孙尚功这些贫农入社，要啥没啥。还说：“农业社有骨头没肉。”
    李财也念叨着：我有一头骡子，一头驴，除了作务庄稼，有功夫还能上煤窑驮炭。
    这时，老孙的两只手放在袖筒里扳起指头数起来。数来数去，村里有十户养骡马的户，就戈有玉一个人跟上他的兄弟（社长）入了社；又数着，社里现在有五十户，总有二十来户是困难户。人家赵登山、李财都还没入社，我这急啥哩？自己想留十亩好麦茬地还不让留哩！趁早拿定主意出社吧！
    党支部书记魏文进、社长戈有谦听说老孙又要出社，就来找他再谈入社的好处。
    支部书记和社长说了大半天，老孙大半天功夫说了几句话：“人家老汉不叫入，女人也找麻烦，我一只手拍不响呀！即便我一个人入了社，一家人几个心事，咋能放下心生产呢？”
    看到老孙拿定主意要出社，社长就告诉他：再等等也可以，你先参加互助组吧。
    老孙没有参加互助组，照老样单干起来了。
      好坏分明
    天刚亮，农业生产合作社的大钟当，当，当地响了起来。一大早，魏庄村男男女女老老少少就沸腾起来了。一队青年人扛着新崭崭的五张新式步犁，赶着牛上山了。一个年轻小伙子说：现在完全改用新式步犁，以后该使用双轮双铧犁了。一个年轻人不服气地说：我还等着开拖拉机哩！年轻的姑娘们、老汉、老人们扛着镢头、铁锨、锄头，各自走向不同的生产岗位。在旧社会，村周围尽是荒山土坡，只有少的可怜的几苗独树。去年，社里就种了杏树七十亩，杨柳树十五亩。放羊的牧童，在大清早就挨家逐户地把羊赶到羊场去踩粪。在旧社会，村里只有几家地主、富农养活着羊，农民养羊的很少；现在，村里已有三大群六百多只羊，每户平均有七只羊；困难户入社以后也养起羊了。
    去年三天两头总是下着雨；雨多草旺，能下地的时间又少，这对老孙来说，是太不吉利了。
    有几天没下雨，社里的钟打得更早了。社里的男男女女老老少少，披星戴月，来了个总动员，突击锄苗。没用几天功夫，社里的二百来亩谷子锄过两遍了。社里把庄稼锄完，还抽出了人到煤矿上做工，给国家修路、植树造林，还烧石灰搞副业，总共挣回一千九百多万元。
    老孙这几天可发了愁。以前听到社里打钟也就爬起来了，这几天可实在够呛。弟兄两个起早搭黑，“施家地”的十亩谷子连头遍还没锄过来，接畔的社里的谷子已经锄过两遍了。社里的谷子是黍茬，他的谷子是麦茬（麦茬地比黍茬地好），苗子刚上来时，老孙看见他的谷苗比社里的茁壮，暗暗自喜：“我要入了社，吃亏可没深浅。”下了几场雨，社里一到天晴突击锄了两遍；老孙弟兄两人却怎样也锄不过，苗子留的参差不齐，地里的草长的比谷苗还茂盛哩！老孙这时看了看社里的谷子，长出了一口气。
    那几天老孙不让他的十五岁的儿子孙茂上学校去了，最后还来了个“杨家将上阵”——全家出马。没几天，老人孩子都“草鸡”了，孩子满手磨起了水泡，老人说腰痛，谁也不去了。弟兄俩紧锄慢锄，苗子终于还是荒在地里了。
    孙义老汉给儿子出了个主意：雇上几个人。
    雇人！老孙打量了一下，这在前几年没搞起互助组以前还可以，从一九五一年有了互助组以后，雇人就困难了。有了农业社，雇人就更困难了。像过去给人当雇工的魏善、孙尚功、赵常富他们二十来户都入社了，到那里去雇人？现在在社外的，他们还想着雇人哩！赵登山老汉还不是因为没雇上人，把十几亩谷子荒在地里了？
    重新入社
    庄稼黄了。农业生产合作社在庄稼收割以前，先估计产量，做了个预分方案。社里请了几个互助组长和单干农民，一起参加估产，也请了老孙来。他们顺着河沟，先到“施家地”参观农业生产合作社的谷子。老孙听说去“施家地”，就想起了他的十亩麦茬地，预先祝祷着：去那里可千万不要看我的十亩麦茬地。社里的一片一片的谷子，虽然受了涝灾，但因为用新式步犁耕的深，上粪又多，锄的勤，减产不大；大家估计每亩平均能打七斗，和前年差不多。“社里的黍茬谷子打七斗，我的麦茬谷子该打多少？”老孙的心里又折腾开了他的十亩麦茬谷子，看起来就像缺奶的孩子，七长八短，稠一块，稀一块，有的地方草比苗子还长的旺，穗头朝天，风吹着摆来摆去，真给老孙丢人现眼。社长回过头，站在地边上，指着老孙的谷子说：“你们估计一下这块地每亩能打多少谷子？”互助组长郭连说：
  “老孙这块地查田定产和社里的是一样的，还是麦茬，照理该多打一些，可是我看样子最多打四斗。”老孙这时涮的一下红到脖子根。他把入社时前前后后的事情想了又想，自己责备自己：入了社就不该出社呀！现在要是入社，还不敢定人家要哩不？思想又斗争起来了。
    没几天，县里让村里派一个人，要到浑源县荞麦川农业社和阳高西岭村参观山区水土保持和农林牧全面发展的情形。村里确定让老孙去了。
    到县里，县委农村工作部先介绍了本县陈家庄农业生产合作社今年使用双轮双铧犁耕地的好处。这时他就想起了：我的土黄骡子再好，只一头骡子也拉不动双铧犁呀！再说，单干那能有力量使用双铧犁呢！到了专署，他用心听了荞麦川从建起社就进行山区建设，农业生产合作社能把“穷沟变富沟”，“荒山变茂林”。老孙想，要是单干，做梦也做不到这些。他原来以为：我们魏庄荒山土坡，
  一年只种上点砂石地，打些粮食，能糊口过日子，就挺满足了；反正拖拉机也不能上山。他听了讲荞麦川建设山区的远景，又亲眼看到了阳高西岭村的农民组织起来植树造林，把荒山变成了茂林。他又想到，魏庄农业生产合作社不是也开始植树造林、种植果树了吗？最近还听说社里要集体经营羊群。魏庄要是也像荞麦川一像，全村农民入了社，五年以后，该变成个啥样子？一想到这里，老孙就想起了他单干的苦楚。“人家都走社会主义哩，我瞎闷闷地还不知道往那里走哩！”参观后，各地代表都讨论着回去以后，怎样改变他们山区的面貌。有的计划搞水土保持、修梯田、打地?，有的要发展畜牧业，有的要植树造林，每个人都有一个建设山区的“底底”。老孙心里也琢磨着：怎样把魏庄村也变的和荞麦川、西岭村一样呢？他也有个“底底”。可是，他又想到，村里大部分人都入社了，他却还在单干。因此，他的“底底”只是装在肚子里，在大家面前不好意思说出来。
      老孙参观回来，连家没顾得回，就去找社长要求入社。在一旁坐着的孙尚功、赵常富看到老孙一进门二话没说，就要求入社，暗地里想：老孙这次参观可真解决思想问题了。赵常富带笑地问老孙：
  “你怎能舍下你的土黄骡子和十亩麦茬地哩？”老孙脸上虽然猛一红，但看见老赵是开玩笑凑热闹，也就笑着说：“再不要提那了。前年没入社是个小败兴，去年没入社是个大败兴。现在再不入社，要败兴的连眉毛也长不住了。”
