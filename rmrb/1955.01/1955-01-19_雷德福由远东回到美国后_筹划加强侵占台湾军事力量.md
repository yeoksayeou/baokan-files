Xinhua News Agency, January 18th:

Radford, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, is planning to strengthen U.S. military aggression in Taiwan and Northeast Asia after returning to the United States from his activities in the Far East.

According to American columnist Robert Allen, Radford has submitted several urgent military recommendations to U.S. President Eisenhower. Radford's report on the Taiwan invasion issue suggests that the United States directly station its air force in Taiwan and immediately rush fifty jet fighters to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

In the report, Radford admitted that he had held negotiations with Japan, South Korea, and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique regarding the establishment of a Northeast Asian aggressive bloc. Radford revealed that Japan was not so "enthusiastic" about participating in the Northeast Asian group "and expressed many reservations in several areas regarding the establishment of such an alliance at present." However, Radford still advocated expanding Japan's new armed forces by twofold as quickly as possible.

Radford's report illustrates that the U.S. plan to form a Northeast Asian group and rearm Japan is an important element of the U.S. war threat against China.

    雷德福由远东回到美国后
    筹划加强侵占台湾军事力量
    【新华社十八日讯】美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福在远东进行了活动回到美国後，正在筹划加强美国在台湾和东北亚的军事侵略力量。
    据美国专栏作家罗伯特·艾伦透露，雷德福已向美国总统艾森豪威尔提出好几个紧急的军事上的建议。雷德福关于侵占台湾问题提出的报告建议：美国把空军直接驻扎在台湾，并且立即赶运五十架喷气战斗机给蒋介石卖国集团。
    雷德福在报告中承认，他和日本、南朝鲜、蒋介石卖国集团举行过关于建立东北亚侵略集团的谈判。雷德福透露，日本对于参加东北亚集团并不是那样“热心”，“并且在好些地方对在目前建立这种联盟表示了许多保留的意见”。不过，雷德福还是主张，尽速把日本新的武装部队扩大一倍。
    雷德福的报告说明，美国策划东北亚集团和重新武装日本，正是美国对中国进行战争威胁的重要环节。
