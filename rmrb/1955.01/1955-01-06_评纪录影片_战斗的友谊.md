    On the Documentary Film "Fighting Friendship"
    Zhong Dianfei
    Directed by: Wang Shui. Chief Cinematographer: Hao Yusheng. Produced by: Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio
    "Fighting Friendship" is one of the better full-length documentaries produced in our country last year, and also a better one among the films documenting visits to China by foreign delegations over the years. Its success lies in two aspects: first, the activities of the Korean People's Delegation to China themselves had rich and moving content, and second, the creation began to break through some old conventions and establish the theme of the film.
    Now, those who have seen the film will probably admit that the scenes of the Korean People's Delegation to China meeting with Mother Huang (Deng Fangzhi, mother of martyr Huang Jiguang), the delegation visiting the hometowns of Luo Shengjiao and Shi Yuanhou, and the delegation sweeping and paying respects at the tombs of martyrs in the Northeast are very moving. In the film, the immeasurable value of these shots lies precisely in the fact that they captured "great moments" and achieved "true reproduction." Through these shots, the film expresses the most sincere and profound friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples.
    Through these shots, the film allows us to see the profound changes in our own nation. I very much like watching the scene of Shi Guangcheng walking out of the station arm in arm with the delegation. His expression is so serene, his steps are so powerful, and every time I watch it, I share a moment of happiness. Because he expresses one of our ideals: we—Chinese people, ordinary Chinese people—have stood up tall. We see his mental state from this kind of interaction.
    Mother Huang is also like this. In the film, we see her walking over, clapping her hands. A Korean girl rushes towards her, and this young female soldier falls into her mother's arms and cries. Mother Huang wipes away her tears and comforts her. A moment later, a boy rushes towards her, but Mother Huang cries—she is somewhat "touched by the scene"! Mother Huang, who lost her son in the war, has once again gained daughters and sons. This old lady, who has lived in the countryside for many years, hugs the two unfamiliar Korean youths tightly, and when she takes out her handkerchief to wipe away the Korean girl's tears, we see the great internationalist mother and internationalist children, we see the new humanity.
    In Luo Shengjiao's hometown, the film allows us to see a new family: "As soon as they got off the bus, Cui ? rushed into the arms of his Chinese father." "Cui ?, this is where your brother Shengjiao grew up, this is your home in China!" "This is the pair of shoes that Mom made for you, take them, child." Here, we see one nation and another nation merging in communist emotion.
    Comrade Wang Shui, the director of the film, told me upon returning: "The people in the Southwest are the most enthusiastic." The Southwest, whether in the past or present, has been a relatively remote place. But when the people there were politically liberated and participated in the great internationalist struggle, they quickly changed themselves. Look, a mother holding her child goes to speak with Ju Fuli, Young Pioneers stop the car to talk to the delegation, whether it is Mother Huang, the mother of Hu Xiudao, or the father of Liu Xingwen, the hugs and conversations are extremely natural. The Chinese people have been inspired by a noble emotion and desire. I value this point because the changes in the people's mental state have immeasurable value.
      "Fighting Friendship" records this change and will promote this change.
    Undoubtedly, the reason why the activities of the Korean People's Delegation to China in various parts of our country have such rich and colorful content is because the Chinese and Korean peoples have established countless inseparable links in the decades of struggle against the common enemy—Japanese and American imperialism. The delegation laid wreaths at the Cemetery of Martyrs in Shijiazhuang to commemorate the Korean youths who sacrificed themselves in the War of Resistance Against Japan, visited the battlefield where General Kim Il-sung fought in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, and met with the heroes who were wounded in the battles of the Dadong River, "1211" Highland, and Shangganling in the hospital. These shots profoundly express the most sincere and deep friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples.
      "Fighting Friendship" has a great advantage in its editing work, that is, the recording of the delegation's activities is focused, and the film is not edited entirely according to the delegation's activity schedule and projects. Now we see that the delegation's activities in Hohhot, Shanxi, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Guangzhou and other places are not many, because the film wants to focus on the meetings between the delegation and Mother Huang, Mother Shi, and Luo Shengjiao's parents. And within this focus, from the delegation sweeping the tombs at the Cemetery of the Volunteer Army Martyrs in Shenyang to meeting Mother Huang in the Southwest, and meeting Mother Shi in Shandong and going to Luo Shengjiao's hometown—the emotions are one step after another, achieving a good artistic effect. Of course, this arrangement differs from the actual activity schedule of the delegation. But what does it matter? Because the film's highest task is to truly express the deep friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples, as for where it actually went first and then where it went, it was originally a technical issue of scheduling.
    In the editing work, the film studio boldly omitted the materials from various banquets held by the delegation in Beijing and the symposiums held in various places. This is naturally also necessary. Because although it is also recording the visit of the delegation to China, since it has become a film, a work, it must have its own central idea. Some are about communication and sightseeing, others are not. The Korean People's Delegation to China is not. Therefore, it is necessary for the film to greatly delete the banquet scenes. The symposiums in various places did have practical content, which was originally one of the purposes of the delegation's visit to China, but the documentary film must pay attention to the audience's interest. The film uses more action-oriented shots, and shots that can more directly express people's feelings, to replace the symposiums in various places, which is obviously beneficial to more concentratedly highlighting the theme of this film.
    Nevertheless, "Fighting Friendship" also has shortcomings.
    The creative design of a documentary film is an important issue related to the success or failure of the film. The film mainly expresses the deep friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples, focusing on the emotional exchanges between the two peoples, but in the entire design and shooting work of the film, because the blueprint for the future film was not yet "well-established," the author wasted too much time, energy, and film on unnecessary materials. The film shot a total of 27,201 feet of material, and now 4,087 feet are used (about 7 to 1), of which 2,700 feet are banquet and symposium materials, but only 34 feet are used now. In the past, we had a habit in documentary films called "compilation," which meant shooting everything first regardless of anything, and then sitting down to edit it after everything was shot. As a result, it is often found that there is too much of what should not be there, and too little of what should be there, even nothing at all, which often makes the quality of the produced films not high, and sometimes even the central idea is not clear. According to years of experience, this approach cannot continue.
    Secondly, this film, as we mentioned earlier, has many exceptionally moving and brilliant shots, but it also has some shots with very low shooting levels—this is mainly reflected in the recording of art programs. The people who filmed Mother Huang and the art programs were from the same cinematographer, one was filmed very well, and the other was filmed very poorly. This shows that many of our documentary photographers today are already relatively proficient in news scene photography, but when it comes to shooting art programs, they feel somewhat powerless. This is not only the case when shooting the art programs of "Fighting Friendship," but there are many similar situations in other films. This raises the task of systematically improving the artistic and technical cultivation of photographers. Although newsreel photographers do not necessarily shoot stage documentaries, mastering this ability is beneficial to further improving the quality of newsreel photography.
    The art programs in this film are not well recorded, and of course, there are also reasons for the sets and lighting. We have seen some stage documentary programs from the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio, and the exteriors built are almost the same—a half-bright, half-dark sky, heavy and unattractive clouds, and dim distant mountains... This design is often inconsistent with the style of the program. "Popular Cinema" once published a reader's letter criticizing the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio's "Folk Songs and Dances" for having a crude and shoddy style in this regard, but judging from this film, there is not much improvement. There is no doubt that some thoughts of being simple in the work will directly hinder the further improvement of the quality of the produced films.
    Finally, regarding the narration. The narration of this film is striving not only to explain the pictures, but also to try to give the pictures more content, which is exactly what we need to advocate at present. However, the narrator lacks research on the art of recitation. The biggest flaw in the current narration is that it cannot fully express the artistic conception of the narration content, and lacks emotional ups and downs. The film begins by saying: "The Yalu River! The Jiangbei is the white mountains and black waters of China, and the Jiangnan is the three thousand miles of rivers and mountains of Korea." This was originally a general narrative. If there is a place to focus on, it is to begin to evoke some memories of the relationship between China and Korea. However, the narrator is in a state of tension from the beginning. In this way, the tone is set high from the beginning, and when Mother Huang and others appear, the narrator's emotions can no longer rise. Due to the lack of this artistic relaxation, the entire narration lacks variation. The narrator's emotions are not full enough, and therefore cannot deeply infect the audience.

    评纪录影片“战斗的友谊”
    钟惦棐
    编导：王水　总摄影师：郝玉生　中央新闻纪录电影制片厂出品
    “战斗的友谊”是我国去年出品的较好的长纪录片之一，也是历年来纪录各国访华团的影片中的较好的一部。它底成功方面，一是由于朝鲜人民访华代表团活动本身有着丰富而动人的内容，一是在创作上开始突破了一些老套成规，确定了影片的主题。
    现在看过影片的人，大概都会承认，这影片纪录朝鲜人民访华代表团和黄妈妈（烈士黄继光的母亲邓芳芝）的会见，代表团访问罗盛教和史元厚的家乡，以及代表团在东北扫祭烈士的陵墓等镜头是十分动人的。在影片中，这些镜头的不可估量的价值，正是由于它的确抓住了“伟大的瞬间”，作到了“真实地再现”。影片通过这些镜头，把中朝两国人民最真挚、最深厚的情谊表现出来了。
    影片通过这些镜头，使我们看见了自己民族的深刻变化。我非常喜欢看史光成在车站和代表团挽着臂膀走出车站的镜头，他的神态是那样安详，步伐是那样有力，每看一次，我都分享到一次快乐。因为他表达了我们的一种理想：我们——中国人，中国的普通人，顶天立地地站起来了。我们从这样的接触中看见了他的精神状态。
    黄妈妈也是这样的。在电影上，我们看见她拍着手走过来，一个朝鲜女孩子扑上她，这位青年女战士倒在妈妈的怀里哭了；黄妈妈为她擦眼泪，安慰她。一会儿，一个男孩子扑上她，黄妈妈却哭了——她有些“触景伤情”！在战争中丧失了儿子的黄妈妈，重新又得到了姑娘和儿子。这位长年生活在乡下的老太太，和两个不相识的朝鲜青年搂得紧紧的，当她掏出手巾为那个朝鲜女孩子擦眼泪的时候，我们看见了伟大的国际主义的母亲和国际主义的儿女，我们看见了新的人类。
    在罗盛教的故乡，影片使我们看见了新的家庭：“一下车，崔?就扑到他中国爸爸的怀里。”“崔?，这就是你盛教哥哥生长的地方，这就是你在中国的家呀！”“这是妈妈给你做的鞋子，收下吧，孩子。”在这里我们看见了一个民族和另一个民族，溶合在共产主义的情感之中。
    影片的编导王水同志回来告诉我：“西南的老百姓最热情”。西南无论是过去还是现在，都是一个比较偏僻的地方。但是当那里的人民在政治上得到解放，并且参预了伟大的国际主义的斗争的时候，他们便迅速地改变了自己。你看，一个母亲抱着孩子去和具富力说话，少先队员拦住汽车和代表团交谈，无论是黄妈妈、胡修道的母亲或刘兴文的父亲，拥抱和交谈都极其自然。中国人民已经为一种崇高的情感和愿望所鼓舞。我看重这点，是因为人民这种精神状态的变化有着不可估量的价值。
      “战斗的友谊”纪录了这种变化，并且将推动这种变化。
    无疑的，朝鲜人民访华代表团在我国各地的活动之所以具有极丰富多采的内容，是由于中朝两国人民数十年来在反对共同敌人——日、美帝国主义的斗争中，建立了千丝万缕的不可分解的联系。代表团在石家庄烈士陵园凭吊在抗日战争中牺牲的朝鲜子弟，在延边朝鲜族自治区访问金日成将军当日作战的战场，在医院会见那些曾在大同江、“一二一一”高地、上甘岭作战受伤的英雄们。这些镜头深刻地表现了中朝两国人民最真挚深厚的友谊。
      “战斗的友谊”在编辑工作上有一个很大的优点，即纪录代表团的活动是有重点的，而且不完全按照代表团的活动日程和项目来编辑影片。现在我们看见代表团在呼和浩特、山西、西安、兰州、广州等地的活动是不多的，因为影片要把重心放在代表团和黄妈妈、史妈妈及罗盛教父母亲的会见方面。而在这重点中，代表团从在沈阳志愿军烈士陵园扫墓到西南会见黄妈妈，在山东会见史妈妈和到罗盛教的家乡——情绪是一步紧接一步的，在艺术上获得了很好的效果。当然，这样安排和代表团的实际活动日程是有出入的。但这有什么关系呢？因为影片的最高任务在于真实地表达出中朝两国人民的深厚友谊，至于实际上是先到了那里然后再到那里，原是个日程安排上的技术问题。
    在编辑工作中，电影制片厂大胆地把代表团在北京的各种宴会和各地举行的座谈会的材料省略了。这自然也是有必要的。因为虽是同样纪录访华代表团，但既然成为一个影片，一个作品，便不能不有它的一个中心思想。有的在于交际和观光，有的则不是。朝鲜人民访华代表团便不是。所以影片大大地删除宴会的镜头是必要的。各地的座谈会确也有实际内容，它原是代表团访华目的之一，但是纪录影片不能不注意到观众的兴味，影片用更多富于行动性的镜头，更能直接表达人们的心情的镜头去代替各地的座谈会，对于更加集中地突出这一影片的主题，显然是有好处的。
    尽管如此，“战斗的友谊”也还有缺点。
    作为纪录影片的创作设计是关系影片成败的重要问题。影片主要表现中朝两国人民的深厚的友谊，着重表现两国人民在情感上的交流，但在整个影片的设计和拍摄工作中，由于对未来的影片的蓝图还不是“胸有成竹”的，结果作者为不必要的材料浪费了太多的时间、精力和胶片。影片所拍的素材共有二万七千二百零一呎，现在编用的是四千零八十七呎（约七比一），其中宴会、座谈会等素材共有二千七百呎，现在编用的则只有三十四呎。过去我们在纪录影片上原有一个习惯叫做“汇编”，这就是说不管三七二十一先拍下来，等到通通拍完了，然后才坐下来编辑。结果常常发现：不该要的太多，该要的太少，竟至没有，因之使得出品的质量往往不高，有时连中心思想也不明确。按照几年来的经验，这样做法是不能再继续下去的。
    其次，这影片，如我们前面所说的，有着许多异常动人的、光辉的镜头，但同样地也有着一些拍摄水平很低的镜头——这主要表现在艺术节目的纪录方面。拍摄黄妈妈的和拍摄艺术节目的都出于同一摄影师之手，一个拍得很好，一个拍得很不好。这就看出：我们今天有不少纪录片的摄影师已经比较精通在新闻现场摄影的业务，但到拍摄艺术节目时，便感到有些无能为力了。不仅在拍摄“战斗的友谊”的艺术节目时是如此，别的影片也有许多相似的情况。这就向我们提出了应该有系统地提高摄影师的艺术和技术修养的任务。虽然新闻片摄影师不一定拍摄舞台纪录片，但掌握了这种能力，对于进一步提高新闻纪录摄影的质量是有好处的。
    这个影片的艺术节目纪录得不好，当然还有布景及灯光方面的原因。我们看过中央新闻纪录电影制片厂的一些舞台纪录节目，搭的外景，几乎是一律的——半明不暗的天空，沉重而不美丽的云，灰暗的远山……这种设计，常常与节目的风格不协调。“大众电影”曾经发表读者来信批评过中央新闻纪录电影制片厂出品的“民间歌舞”在这方面有粗制滥造的作风，但从这影片看，改进是不大的。毫无疑问，在工作中的一些因陋就简的思想，是会直接妨碍出品质量的进一步提高的。
    最后，关于解说。这影片的解说词是在努力不止于解说画面，而企图赋予画面更多的内容，这正是我们目前所需要提倡的。但解说（朗诵）者对朗诵这一艺术还缺少钻研。现在的解说的最大缺陷是不能充分地表现出解说词内容的意境，缺少感情上的起伏。影片开始说：“鸭绿江！江北是中国的白山黑水，江南是朝鲜的三千里江山。”这原是一般的叙述，如果有可以着力的地方，那便是开始唤起一些对中朝两国关系的回忆。但解说者一开始便处于紧张状态。这样，一开始便把调子定高了，及到黄妈妈等人出现，解说的感情便再也昂涨不上去了。由于缺少这种艺术上的张弛，使得整个的解说缺少变化。解说者的情绪也不够饱满。因而不能使观众受到深深的感染。
