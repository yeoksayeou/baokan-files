    Den of Vice
　　Made by Zhao Zhifang
    "...Within the major and minor cities throughout the country, there are still many 'strongholds' spreading feudal and bourgeois ideologies... Through those shops and stalls renting out yellow books, approximately one and a half million to two million readers (children, adolescents, and adults) nationwide are being poisoned daily." (Quoted from Shen Yanbing's speech at the First Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference)

    魔窟
　　赵志方作
    “……在全国各大、小城市内，传播封建思想和资产阶级思想的‘据点’也还不少。……通过那些出租黄色图书的铺、摊，全国每天大约有一百五十万到二百万的读者（儿童、少年和成年人）受着毒害。”  （引自沈雁冰委员在中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第一次全体会议上的发言）
