Xinhua News Agency, January 6th:

    From the situation of farmers across the country urgently demanding means of production and means of livelihood, it can be seen that farmers' purchasing power has greatly changed, and rural areas have increasingly become a broad market for industrial products. According to a survey conducted by the Ministry of Commerce in 1954 in seventeen provinces including Jiangsu, Shandong, Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangdong, and Xikang, the growth rate of rural purchasing power is greater than that of cities, and the proportion is increasing year by year; the growth rate of purchasing power is also greater in rural areas than in cities. In 1954, the total sales of state-owned commercial enterprises increased by more than two times compared with 1951, and the commodities organized and supplied locally by the cooperative system were not included in the statistics, among which the sales of commodities such as cloth, matches, and bicycles to rural areas increased significantly.

    In old China, farmers used to describe their poverty and inability to afford things by saying "three years without going to the market, ten years without going to the city." This situation is gone forever. Queuing to buy things has become a new phenomenon in rural areas. The increase in farmers' purchasing power is specifically reflected in two aspects: expanding production and improving living standards. From 1952 to 1954, the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives made its best efforts to supply more than 1.22 million pieces of new-style farm tools such as various types of walking plows, waterwheels, and double-shared plows, more than 73 million catties of pesticides, and more than 400,000 pieces of agricultural machinery. This quantity is far from meeting the requirements of the vast rural market. In the history of our country, farmers mainly used farm manure and rarely had money to buy commercial fertilizer, but now the situation is completely different. In 1953, the amount of chemical fertilizers and cake fertilizers supplied by the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives increased by more than three times compared with 1951. Farmers' demands for means of production have also changed greatly. First, they wanted seven-inch walking plows, then they changed to eight-inch walking plows, and now they want double-shared plows. Farmers call pesticides "crop treasures."

    Before liberation, farmers worked all year round and could not get enough to eat. "Hoping for a better year next year, but next year is still a tattered cotton jacket" was a summary of the farmers' painful lives. Now, the farmers in New China have not only gotten rid of the life of hunger and cold before liberation, but also their demands for means of livelihood are changing with each passing day. For example, in terms of clothing, they not only wear new clothes, but also begin to pay attention to the quality and color of the fabrics. Khaki and printed cloth are also very popular in rural areas. In 1953, the national sales of cloth increased by more than two times compared with 1950. After the implementation of planned supply of cotton cloth last year, the supply quantity was still higher than in 1953. In the past, farmers used kettles to hold boiled water, but now most of them have replaced them with thermos bottles. In 1954, the China Department Store supplied about 80% more bamboo-cased thermos bottles than in 1952. In the past, farmers used torches to hold meetings and check crops at night, but now more and more people are using flashlights. In many areas, farmers used to use flint to make fire, but now they have also switched to using matches. In 1954, state-owned commercial enterprises planned to supply more than two and a half times more matches than in 1951.

    The increase in farmers' purchasing power is even more prominent in high-yield areas. In the past, industrial products that were only sold in cities, such as wool yarn, woolen fabrics, knitwear, bicycles, and children's clothing, are now welcomed by farmers in grain, cotton, and specialty product areas. In the second half of 1954, more than 310,000 pounds of wool yarn were shipped from Chongqing to grassroots state-owned stores in various places. Last year, the total turnover of social commodities in the Central and Southern regions increased by 10% compared with 1953. Even the rapid recovery of the market in some disaster areas in Hubei Province is amazing. Last year, during the peak season, state-owned department stores in Xiaogan, Sui County, and Xishui and other counties added purchase plans for more than 100 kinds of commodities such as towels, socks, and wool yarn, with Xiaogan County increasing by twelve times. The state-owned department store in Xinzhou County originally planned to sell twelve barrels of iron nails (used by disaster victims to repair houses) in October last year, but later the sales volume expanded to 140 barrels and was still not enough to supply. The development of disaster-stricken farmers' activities of "self-reliance through production and rebuilding their homes" has prospered the market, which was something that even state-owned commercial departments did not expect. The disaster-stricken farmers said gratefully: "Only Chairman Mao can turn autumn into spring." Especially since the unified purchase and sale of grain, oil, and cotton, new phenomena of "ten increases and five decreases" have appeared in rural areas of the Central and Southern regions. In rural areas, the number of mules and horses has increased, the number of agricultural tools has increased, the turnover of supply and marketing cooperatives has increased, the number of people wearing new clothes has increased, the number of new tile houses has increased, the enthusiasm for production has increased, the number of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams has increased, the number of credit cooperatives has increased, the number of activists has increased, and the socialist consciousness of cadres and the masses has increased. The buying and selling of land has decreased, the hiring of laborers has decreased, the renting of land has decreased, the hoarding of grain has decreased, and the number of households hiring laborers has decreased.

    The continuous rise and new changes in farmers' purchasing power are inevitable phenomena resulting from the implementation of the Party's various policies in rural areas and the beginning of national economic construction after liberation. The implementation of large-scale national construction and the increase in the quantity of agricultural products and native and special products purchased by the state from rural areas are very large. Taking grain as an example, due to reasonable grain prices, farmers in 1953 gained more than 3 trillion yuan in income from unified grain purchases.

    Another new factor in the concentration of rural funds and farmers' demands for expanding production and improving their living standards: Before the unified purchase and sale and the publicity of the general line, many farmers were advancing along the path of "spontaneous forces," but now this path is blocked. In Taikang County, Henan Province, before the unified purchase and sale of grain in 1953, due to the speculative activities of private merchants and rich peasants and the combination of farmers' spontaneous forces, the price of wheat once rose to 2,400 yuan per catty (the listed price was 800 yuan) during the period between the exhaustion of the old crop and the harvesting of the new crop. At that time, state-owned grain companies could not crack down on the black market even by selling hundreds of thousands of catties of grain a day. Some poor farmers had to sell land to buy food, while farmers with grain and money were keen on hoarding grain and speculating, and were unwilling to live peacefully and engage in production. After the unified purchase and sale of grain, grain prices have been stable, and farmers can no longer hoard grain or speculate.

    The spontaneous forces of "buying livestock is not as good as buying land, buying land is not as good as lending money, and lending money is not as good as hoarding grain" are gradually disappearing in rural areas. From 1953 to 1954 in Taikang County, the number of farmers buying and selling land decreased from 5,803 households to 959 households, the number of grain hoarding households decreased from 1,176 households to 48 households, the number of hired laborers decreased from 856 households to 570 households, and the number of rented land decreased from 2,262 households to 1,965 households. Farmers have shifted from the original intention of hoarding grain, lending money, buying land, and engaging in speculative business to pursuing normal expansion of production and improvement of living standards, which is the reason why rural purchasing power has increased again after unified purchase and sale, and rural areas have increasingly become the main sales market for industrial products.

    At present, state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives are strengthening the supply of materials for the Spring Festival and spring plowing based on the new situation of continuous growth and changes in rural purchasing power, and are actively organizing the source of goods for 1955.

    全国农民购买力不断增长
    农村成为工业品更加广阔的市场
    【新华社六日讯】从全国各地农民对生产资料和生活资料的迫切要求的情况，可以看出农民购买力有很大变化，农村已日益成为工业品的广阔市场。根据商业部一九五四年在江苏、山东、云南、四川、广东、西康等十七个省的调查，城乡购买力在原有增长的水平上，农村购买力增长速度大于城市，比重逐年上升；购买力增长幅度也是农村大于城市。一九五四年国营商业销售总额比一九五一年增加两倍多，合作社系统就地组织供应的商品还没统计在内，其中销售农村的布匹、火柴、自行车等商品增长数量都很大。
    旧中国农民曾以“三年不赶集、十年不进城”来形容他们穷苦买不起东西的情景，这情景已一去不复返了。排队买东西成为农村的新气象。农民购买力提高具体表现在两个方面，一是扩大生产、一是改善生活。一九五二年到一九五四年中华全国供销合作总社尽了最大努力，供应各式步犁、各式水车、双铧犁等新式农具一百二十二万多件、农药七千三百多万斤、农械四十多万件，这数量远远不能满足广大农村市场的要求。我国农民历史上以农家肥料为主，很少有钱去买商品肥料，现在情况完全不同了。一九五三年中华全国供销合作总社供应的化学肥料、饼肥比一九五一年增加了三倍多。农民对生产资料的要求也有很大变化，先要七寸步犁、后改要八寸步犁、现在要双铧犁了。农民把农药称为“庄稼宝”。
    解放前农民终年劳动，不得一饱，“今年盼望明年好，明年仍是一件破棉袄”是农民对自己苦痛生活的总结。现在新中国的农民不但摆脱了解放前饥寒交迫的生活，而且对生活资料的需求日新月异。如衣着方面，不但穿上新衣服，并且开始考究衣料的质量和颜色，卡其、花布在农村也很畅销。一九五三年全国销售的布比一九五零年增加两倍以上，去年棉布实行计划供应后，供应数量仍高于一九五三年。过去农民盛开水使用水壶，现在大都换上暖水瓶，一九五四年中国百货公司供应的竹壳暖水瓶比一九五二年增加百分之八十左右。过去农民在夜间开会，查看庄稼都用火把，现在用手电筒的增多了。不少地区的农民过去取火用打火石，现在也改用火柴了。国营商业一九五四年准备供应的火柴比一九五一年增加两倍半还多。
    在丰产区农民购买力的提高更加突出。往年只在城市才有销路的工业品，如毛线、绒料、针织品、自行车以及儿童服装，现在粮、棉产区和土产、特产区，这些工业品都受到农民的欢迎。一九五四年下半年由重庆运销各地基层国营商店的毛线有三十一万多磅。去年中南地区社会商品流转总额比一九五三年增加百分之十。连湖北省一些灾区，市场恢复得迅速，也是惊人的。去年旺季孝感、随县、浠水等县的国营百货公司对毛巾、袜子、毛线等一百多种商品都追加了要货计划，孝感县增加了十二倍。新洲县国营百货商店去年十月原计划销售铁钉十二桶（灾民修盖房屋用），后来销售额扩大到一百四十桶还不够供应。灾区农民进行“生产自救、重建家园”活动的展开，繁荣了市场，这是连国营商业部门也没料到的。灾区农民感激地说：“只有毛主席才能把秋天变成春天。”特别是自粮食、油料、棉花统购统销以后，中南地区农村已出现了“十大增加、五大减少”的新气象。农村是骡马增加、农具增加、供销合作社营业额增加、穿新衣服增加、新瓦房增加、生产劲头增加、农业生产合作社及互助组增加、信用合作社增加、积极分子增加、干部和群众的社会主义觉悟增加。买卖土地的减少、雇工减少、出租土地减少、囤粮减少、雇工户减少。
    农民购买力不断上升和新变化，是解放后党在农村各项政策的执行和国家经济建设开始的必然现象。国家大规模建设的进行，国家从农村收购的农产品和土产、特产品数量增加很大。仅以粮食为例，由于粮价合理，一九五三年农民在统购粮食中多得的收益就有三万亿多元。
    农村资金集中，农民要求扩大生产，改善生活的另一新的因素：在统购统销和总路线宣传以前，许多农民是按照“自发势力”的道路前进的，现在此路不通了。河南省太康县在一九五三年粮食统购统销前，由于私商、富农的投机活动和农民的自发势力的结合，在青黄不接时，麦价曾涨到二千四百元一斤（牌价八百元）。当时国营粮食公司一天抛售几十万斤粮食还是打击不了黑市。贫困农民有的不得不卖地买口粮，有粮有钱的农民热中于囤粮、捣粮，不安心过日子和从事生产。粮食统购统销后，粮价一直稳定，农民无法再囤粮、投机了。
  “买牲口不如买地、买地不如放债、放债不如囤粮”的自发势力在农村逐渐消迹。太康县从一九五三到一九五四年，全县农民买卖土地的由五千八百零三户减为九百五十九户，囤粮户从一千一百七十六户减到四十八户，雇工从八百五十六户减到五百七十户，出租土地从二千二百六十二户减到一千九百六十五户。农民把原来想囤粮、放债、买地、搞投机生意转移到追求正常的扩大生产、改善生活，这就是农村购买力在统购统销后又有新的增长，农村日益成为工业品主要销售市场的原因。
    目前国营商业和合作社正根据农村购买力不断增长和变化的新情况，加强春节、春耕的物资供应，积极组织一九五五年的货源。
