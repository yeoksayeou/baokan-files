Double-Wheel Two-Furrow Plow

    The double-wheel two-furrow plow is a frame plow pulled by livestock. Because it has two wheels and two plowshares, it is called a double-wheel two-furrow plow (a plow with only one plowshare is called a double-wheel one-furrow plow).

    This plow is made entirely of iron and consists mainly of the following parts: (1) Plow frame: Consisting of left and right plow beams and a crossbeam, it resembles a flat rectangular frame and serves as the skeleton of the entire plow. The plowshares, wheels, and other parts are installed on this frame.

  (2) Wheels: There is a land wheel and a furrow wheel, mounted on either side of the plow frame, one in front and one behind. When plowing, the furrow wheel runs in the furrow, and the land wheel runs on the unplowed land. Its main function is to balance the plow frame, fix the depth, reduce pulling force, and facilitate operation. (3) Plowshares: Similar to the five-furrow plow used with tractors; the plow bottom is flat, with two plowshares. These two plowshares are side by side, one in front of the other. One plowshare can plow six inches wide, and two plowshares can plow one foot and two inches wide in one pass, turning the soil finely and evenly. (4) Traction adjustment mechanisms. Including the traction plate, vertical adjustment plate, adjustment rod, furrow wheel adjustment screw, etc. The depth of plowing can be adjusted using these mechanisms.

    This plow has many advantages, and farmers love it once they use it. In general, its advantages are as follows: (1) It plows deeply and evenly. In general soil, the double-furrow plow can plow about five inches deep, one or two inches deeper than the old plow. The furrow bottom is flat, without grids, making it easier for crop seedlings to take root. (2) It plows quickly and pulls lightly. Although this plow is made entirely of iron, it is not very heavy. In Northeast China, it is mostly pulled by horses, so it is also called a horse-drawn plow; trials in other regions have shown that mules, oxen, and donkeys can also pull it. In Sunjiazhai, a suburb of Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, trials with the double-furrow plow showed that one person with three oxen could plow ten mu of sticky soil per day; with the old plow, one person with two oxen could only plow four mu per day. In Xinzhuang Village, Changzi County, one person with three donkeys could plow twelve mu of loam soil per day; with the old plow, one person with two donkeys could only plow four mu per day. The efficiency is generally about twice that of the old plow. (3) It turns the soil evenly, covers the grass tightly, and is widely adaptable. It can be used on both sandy soil and general clay soil. (4) The plow handle does not need to be held, saving effort and labor. Only when turning at the end of the field is it necessary to use a hand to move the plow handle to assist in turning. The livestock can pull it smoothly. A farmer in Jiangsu said, "I struggled with the old plow my whole life. Plowing once made my waist ache and my arms sore. The double-furrow plow has freed my arms." Because it does not need to be held, women can also use it. In the past, plowing with the old plow was hard work, and most women were not strong enough to do it. With this plow, as long as you learn the operating techniques, women can do it just as well as men. The advantages above have been proven by repeated trials in various places. Farmers praise it: "Saves labor and produces results!" Farmers in Jincheng, Shanxi, even composed a jingle after seeing the double-furrow plow at work: "Plowing without holding the handle, acts like a ground tiger, can be deep or shallow, level up and down."

    Because deep plowing is key to increasing production, the promotion of new-style animal-powered farm implements in various places is mainly focused on plows. In 1950, double-wheel two-furrow plows and double-wheel one-furrow plows began to be promoted and tested in various provinces in Northeast China. Subsequently, Shandong, Shanxi, and other provinces also began to focus on trials. To date, approximately 100,000 units have been promoted and used in various places (mostly in the Northeast region). In order to cooperate with the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement, the Ministry of Agriculture has determined that 400,000 double-wheel two-furrow and double-wheel one-furrow plows will be promoted this year and plans to promote more than 1.5 million units in the plain dryland areas north of the Huai River during the First Five-Year Plan period.

    China's socialist transformation of agriculture will proceed in two steps: cooperativization and mechanization. Before large-scale mechanization, new-style animal-powered farm implements should be gradually promoted along with the development of cooperativization. Agricultural production cooperatives have contiguous land, more livestock, and more capital, making them most suitable for promoting the use of double-furrow plows. Individual farmers have scattered land and less capital, making it difficult to use double-furrow plows. Some farmers, seeing that the double-furrow plow can plow deeply and increase production, are even more enthusiastic about joining cooperatives, which will promote the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

    At present, some rural cadres do not have a clear understanding of the importance and specific benefits of promoting double-furrow plows. Some say, "As long as we have enough fertilizer and take good care of the crops, the old plow and harrow can still produce more grain"; others say, "It is better to wait for tractors in the future." These ideas are unrealistic. How well crops are planted, the quality of the land, the amount of water and fertilizer, and the skill level, of course, all play a role, but the most important factor is the tools used. Being able to use a tractor with a five-furrow plow to plow the land is of course very good, but since China cannot yet mass-produce tractors and gasoline, and using horses or oxen with a double-furrow plow can also increase grain production and improve soil fertility, then looking down on the double-furrow plow and thinking of using tractors in one fell swoop is wrong.

    双轮双铧犁
    双轮双铧犁是用牲口拉的一种架式犁。因为它有两个轮子和两个犁头，所以叫做双轮双铧犁（只有一个犁头的，叫双轮一铧犁）。
    这种犁全部是用铁做的，主要的有以下几部分：（一）犁架：由左右两个犁梁和一个横梁搭成，像一个平放着的长方形的框子，是整个犁的骨头架子，犁头，轮子和别的零件都安装在这个架子上。
  （二）轮子：有一个地轮一个沟轮，分装在犁架的两边，一前一后，犁起地来沟轮就走在犁沟里，地轮走在未耕的地上。它的主要作用是平衡犁架，固定深度，减少拉力，便于运行。（三）犁头：和拖拉机带的五铧犁差不多；犁底是平的，有两个犁头。这两个犁头一前一后并排着，一个犁头能耕六寸宽，两个犁头一趟耕过去就是一尺二寸宽，翻土又碎又均匀。（四）牵引调节机件。包括牵引板、立调节板、调节杆、沟轮调节丝杠等等。在耕地的时候，想深想浅，都可用这些机件调节。
    这种犁的好处很多，庄稼人一用就喜爱。总的来说，它的好处有以下几种：（一）耕的深，耕的平。在一般土壤中，双铧犁能深耕五寸左右，比旧犁深一、二寸，犁过去沟底平，没有格子，庄稼苗好扎根。（二）耕的快，拉着轻。这种犁虽然混身是铁，却并不很笨重。东北地区多用马拉，所以又叫它马拉犁；关内试验，骡、牛、驴都可以拉。山西太原市郊孙家寨试用双铧犁，一个人三头牛，粘土地每天耕十亩；旧犁一人两头牛，一天才耕四亩。长子县辛庄村一个人三头驴，壤土地每天耕十二亩；旧犁一人两头驴，一天才耕四亩。效率一般比旧犁提高一倍左右。（三）翻土匀，盖草严，适应性广，砂土和一般粘土地都可以使用。（四）犁把不用扶，省力也省工，只是到地头时用手搬动犁把帮助拐弯，牲口拉着就能顺顺当当的犁过去。江苏一个农民说：“和旧犁缠了一辈子，犁一次地累得我腰疼胳膊酸，双铧犁可把我的胳膊解放了。”因为不用扶，妇女们也可使用。过去用旧犁耕地是重活，多数妇女体力弱，干不了。这种犁只要学会操作技术，妇女和男人一样可以干。以上这些好处，是各地试验多次证明的。农民们称赞它：“省工出活！”山西晋城农民看过双铧犁耕地还编了个顺口溜：“犁地手不扶，活像抓地虎，能深也能浅，上下平展展。”
    因为深耕是增产的关键，所以各地推广新式畜力农具都是以犁为主。一九五○年双轮双铧犁和双轮一铧犁开始在东北各省推广试用，接着山东、山西等省也开始重点试验，到目前止，各地已推广使用的约在十万部以上（绝大部分在东北地区）。为了配合农业合作化运动的发展，农业部确定今年推广双轮双铧和双轮一铧犁四十万部，并计划在第一个五年计划期间在淮河以北平原旱作地区推广一百五十万部以上。
    我国的农业社会主义改造，要分合作化、机械化两步走；在大规模机械化之前，就要随着合作化的发展，逐步推广新式畜力农具。农业生产合作社土地联片，牲口也多，资金比较充足，推广使用双铧犁最合适。单干农户土地分散，资金少，用双铧犁很不容易，有些农民看到双铧犁能深耕增产，入社就更加积极，这样也就能促进互助合作运动的发展。
    现在有些农村干部对推广双铧犁的重要性和具体好处认识不清楚，有的说：“只要粪上饱、侍弄好，旧犁耙一样能多打粮食”；有的说：“还不如等着将来用拖拉机”。这些想法都是不切实际的。庄稼种得好坏，土地好赖，水粪多少，手艺高低，当然都有关系，可是关系最大的还看是用什么家具。能用拖拉机带上五铧犁耕地当然很好，可是现在我国还不能大量生产拖拉机和汽油，用马或牛带上双铧犁既然也能多打粮食，发挥地力，那么，看不起双铧犁，想一下就用上拖拉机的“一步登天”的想法就是不对的。
