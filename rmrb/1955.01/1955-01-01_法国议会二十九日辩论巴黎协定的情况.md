Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 30th: The French National Assembly held a meeting in the Palais Bourbon on the afternoon of the 29th. Due to the insistence of members of parliament who opposed the rearmament of West Germany, the National Assembly once again postponed the date of the vote of confidence on the first article of the Mendes-France "new" bill – which essentially requested approval of the Paris Accords (stipulating the rearmament of West Germany and its accession to the Western European Union) – proposed on the morning of the 28th.

From early morning, delegations of working people demanding that parliamentarians reject the plan to revive German militarism streamed to the Palais Bourbon. As the National Assembly was about to convene, a large number of workers and other representatives from all walks of life who opposed the arming of West Germany gathered at the entrance of the meeting place. They came from all over France, from places as far away as Marseille and Nice.

In the lounge of the National Assembly, those attempting to induce some parliamentarians to support the Paris Accords continued to engage in frequent activities. After the meeting began, parliamentarian Le Pen first expressed doubts about the legality of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Assembly passing the Mendes-France "new" bill by a majority of one vote on the 28th. He said that he did not know that the Foreign Affairs Committee had held a meeting, so he did not participate, and if he had participated, he would have voted against this "new" bill.

In the ensuing debate, parliamentarians with different political views and from different parties voiced their opposition to the revival of German militarism and the Paris Accords from the rostrum of the Palais Bourbon. Honorary Speaker of the National Assembly, Édouard Herriot, reiterated his opposition to the ratification of the Paris Accords. In his speech, he expressed his concerns about the current authorities and reiterated his demand that France maintain its alliance with the Soviet Union. Herriot said: Ten years ago, France signed a treaty with the Soviet Union, "according to which France must never participate in any alliance against the Soviet Union. I have fought all my life, and I will continue to fight to ensure that whatever obligations France has undertaken are respected." Herriot told Mendes-France: "At present, you can still negotiate with the East. Tomorrow, you must get Germany's consent."

Independent Republican parliamentarian General Aumeran said that arming West Germany is a huge threat filled with factors for the outbreak of war, and the United States is forcing France to embark on a path of gambling.

Parliamentarian André Liautey said: Among those parliamentarians who voted in favor of ratifying the Paris Accords, many are also opposed to rearming West Germany, but they have succumbed to American pressure. He emphasized that after the Paris Accords are ratified, negotiations on a peace treaty with Germany will become "almost impossible." Arming Germany will be a constant threat to France and to peace.

Independent Republican parliamentarian Pierre André said that voting in favor of ratifying the Paris Accords "will have the most terrible consequences, because no French man or woman wants to rearm Germany." He stated that if Germany is armed, it will be difficult to negotiate with the Soviet Union. He said that he would vote against the government on the issue of confidence.

Communist parliamentarian Pierre Villon said that the French Communist Party firmly opposes the revival of German militarism, because the establishment of an aggressive German army will increase the danger of another war. The French Communist Party reiterates its readiness to cooperate with all those who hold different political beliefs but oppose the remilitarization of West Germany.

Parliamentarian Ruston-Lagot once again asked parliamentarians and the Prime Minister to accept his amendment to the "new" bill, which stipulates that negotiations should be held with the Soviet Union before the Paris Accords take effect.

Parliamentarian Palewski said that although he supported the government, he "can only oppose arming Germany in the current situation." At the meeting on the 29th, the leader of the Socialist Party, Guy Mollet, tried his best to advocate the approval of the bill to rearm West Germany. Although he tried his best to defend the rearmament of West Germany, he had to admit that this measure was universally opposed by the French public. Faced with the strong voices of parliamentarians who opposed the rearmament of West Germany and demanded negotiations with the Soviet Union, those who were trying to save the Paris Accords once again played new tricks during the meeting, attempting to influence the attitude of some parliamentarians. Parliamentarians from several bourgeois parties put forward a proposal asking the National Assembly to declare its support for "maintaining the unity of the member states of the Atlantic Group," "consolidating Western European solidarity," and "convening a four-power conference as soon as appropriate preparations are made" after the debate on the Paris Accords is over. This proposal was clearly intended to deceive parliamentarians who demanded negotiations with the Soviet Union into supporting the Paris Accords. Mendes-France also spoke at the meeting, and he once again tried to persuade parliamentarians to vote in favor of ratifying the Paris Accords. He had to admit: "Most French people feel extremely shocked at the thought of arming Germany again ten years after the end of the (French) occupation." At the same time, he once again tried to intimidate the parliamentarians, saying that if the National Assembly opposes the ratification of the Paris Accords, "West Germany will be armed without our participation," and "a crisis in the Atlantic Group" will follow. Despite all the efforts made by Mendes-France and others who supported the Paris Accords, their plan to have the National Assembly hold a vote of confidence on the most important part of the Paris Accords regarding the arming of West Germany on the 29th fell through. The "new" bill proposed by Mendes-France regarding the ratification of this part contained a minor provision, which was originally an amendment proposed by parliamentarian Noel, which required the establishment of a special parliamentary committee to "supervise the implementation of the Paris Accords." Noel himself withdrew this amendment on the 29th, which meant that Mendes-France's "new" bill lost its original form after the deletion of Noel's amendment and should be put to a vote of confidence as a new bill. Communist leader Duclos, on behalf of the Communist parliamentary group, requested a 24-hour postponement of the vote of confidence on the Mendes-France bill, and this request was supported by many parliamentarians from other parties. The proposal to postpone the vote of confidence was submitted to the Steering Committee of the National Assembly for consideration, and finally the Steering Committee decided that the vote of confidence should be postponed to 5 p.m. Paris time on the 30th.

When the crowd outside the National Assembly hall heard the news of the postponement of the vote, they sang "La Marseillaise."

Mendes-France, with the threats and orders from Washington and London weighing on his mind, said in the National Assembly: "The decision can no longer be delayed." He demanded at least a vote of confidence on the entire Paris Accords bill except for the first article. Then a vote was held, with 287 parliamentarians voting in favor and 256 voting against. Compared with a vote of confidence held on the evening of the 27th, the number of votes in favor decreased by two, and the number of votes against increased by five. According to statistics, the number of parliamentarians who voted in favor of the government in the vote of confidence on the 27th accounted for only about 46 percent of all parliamentarians.

The Paris "People's Daily" described Mendes-France's situation as follows: "The debate on the Paris Accords is very much like a difficult obstacle race. Near the finish line, new obstacles continue to appear." Now, the supporters of the Paris Accords hope to rely on threats and inducements to some parliamentarians to ensure that Mendes-France does not ultimately fail to reach the finish line.

### 法国议会二十九日辩论巴黎协定的情况

    法国议会二十九日辩论巴黎协定的情况
    【新华社三十日讯】巴黎消息：法国国民议会二十九日下午在波旁宫举行会议。由于反对重新武装西德的议员们的坚持，国民议会再度推迟了对孟戴斯—弗朗斯二十八日清晨提出的“新”法案——实质上就是要求批准巴黎协定法案第一条（规定重新武装西德和使西德加入西欧联盟）的信任投票的日期。
    从清晨起，要求议员拒绝复活德国军国主义计划的劳动人民的代表团就川流不息地来到波旁宫。到国民议会快开会的时候，会场门口聚集了大批反对武装西德的工人及其他阶层代表团。他们来自法国各地，来自马赛和尼斯那样遥远的地方。
    在国民议会休息室里，企图诱迫一些议员支持巴黎协定的人们在继续进行频繁的活动。　会议开始后，议员勒庞首先对国民议会外交委员会二十八日以一票多数通过孟戴斯—弗朗斯“新”法案一事的合法性表示怀疑。他说，他不知道外交委员会举行会议，所以他没有参加，假使他参加了的话，他要投票反对这个“新”法案。
    在接着举行的辩论中，不同政治见解、不同党派的议员从波旁宫的讲坛上发出反对复活德国军国主义、反对巴黎协定的声音。国民议会荣誉议长爱德华·赫里欧重申他反对批准巴黎协定的态度。他在讲话中表达了他对目前当局的担心，再度要求法国保持同苏联的联盟。赫里欧说：十年前，法国同苏联签订了一项条约，“根据这项条约规定，法国决不参加任何针对苏联的联盟。我一生都在斗争，我将继续斗争，以使法国所承担的不论什么义务都得到尊重。”赫里欧告诉孟戴斯—弗朗斯说：“在目前，你还能够同东方谈判。明天，你必须得到德国的同意才行”。
    独立共和党议员奥麦朗将军说，武装西德是一个充满着战争爆发的因素的巨大威胁，美国正在迫使法国走上赌博的道路。
    议员安德烈·利奥戴发言说：在那些投票赞成批准巴黎协定的议员当中，有很多人也是反对重新武装西德的，但是他们在美国压力之下屈服了。他强调指出，在巴黎协定得到批准之后，关于对德和约的谈判将成为“几乎不可能”。武装德国将是对法国和对和平的一种经常的威胁。
    独立共和党议员皮埃尔·安德烈说，投票赞成批准巴黎协定“将产生最可怕的后果，因为任何一个法国男女都不希望重新武装德国”。他表示，如果把德国武装起来，那就很难同苏联进行谈判。他说，他将在信任问题上投反对票。
    共产党议员皮埃尔·维戎发言说，法国共产党坚决反对复活德国军国主义，因为建立一支侵略性的德国军队将增加另一次战争的危险，法国共产党重申它准备同抱有不同政治信仰的一切反对西德重新军国主义化的人合作。
    议员鲁斯多诺—拉果再度要求议员们和总理接受他对“新”法案的修正案，他的修正案规定在巴黎协定生效前同苏联举行谈判。
    议员巴列夫斯基说，虽然他支持政府，但是他“在目前情况下只能反对武装德国”。在二十九日会议上，竭力鼓吹批准重新武装西德的法案的，有社会党领袖居伊·摩勒。他虽然竭力替西德重新武装辩护，可是他也不得不承认这种措施受到了法国公众的普遍反对。面对着反对重新武装西德和要求同苏联谈判的议员们的强烈呼声，竭力要挽救巴黎协定的人又在会议过程中玩弄了新的花样，企图影响一些议员的态度。若干资产阶级党派的议员提出了一项提案，要求国民议会在关于巴黎协定辩论结束以后，宣布支持“维护大西洋集团成员国的团结一致”，“巩固西欧团结”，并且“一俟适当的筹备工作作好，就召开四国会议”。这项提案显然是为了骗取要求同苏联谈判的议员支持巴黎协定。孟戴斯—弗朗斯也在会议上发言，他再一次设法要说服议员们来投票赞成批准巴黎协定。他不得不承认：“大部分法国人一想到（法国）被占领状态结束后十年又要武装德国就感觉极为震惊”。同时，他却再度设法恫吓议员们，说什么如果国民议会反对批准巴黎协定，“西德将在没有我们参加的情况下武装起来”，“大西洋集团的危机”将随之而来。尽管孟戴斯—弗朗斯和其他支持巴黎协定的人作了一切努力，他们想使国民议会在二十九日就批准巴黎协定中最主要的关于武装西德部分举行信任投票的打算还是落空了。孟戴斯—弗朗斯提出的关于批准这一部分的“新”法案中有一项次要的规定，原来是议员诺埃尔提出的修正案，这一项修正案要求设立议会特别委员会来“监督巴黎协定的实施”。诺埃尔在二十九日自己撤回了这项修正案，这使孟戴斯—弗朗斯的“新”法案在删掉诺埃尔的修正案后失去了原来的形式，应该作为一个新的法案举行信任投票。共产党领袖杜克洛代表共产党议会党团要求延期二十四小时就孟戴斯—弗朗斯法案举行信任投票，这项要求得到了其他政党的许多议员的支持。延期举行信任投票的建议提交给国民议会指导委员会考虑，最后指导委员会决定信任投票应该推迟到三十日巴黎时间下午五点举行。
    在国民议会会场外的人群听到延期投票决定的消息时，他们高唱起“马赛曲”。
    脑中萦绕着华盛顿和伦敦的威胁和命令的孟戴斯—弗朗斯在国民议会上说：“再不能延迟作出决定了。”他要求至少就除第一条外的整个巴黎协定法案举行信任投票。接着就举行投票，二百八十七个议员投票赞成，二百五十六个议员投票反对。比起二十七日晚间举行的一次信任投票来，赞成票少了二张，反对票增加了五张。而据统计，在二十七日信任投票中投票支持政府的议员仅占全体议员的百分之四十六左右。
    巴黎“人民报”形容孟戴斯—弗朗斯的处境说：“关于巴黎协定的辩论极像一次艰难险阻的障碍赛马，快到终点的时候，新的障碍不断出现。”现在，巴黎协定的支持者指望再依靠对某些议员进行威胁利诱的手段，来使孟戴斯—弗朗斯最后不致达不到终点。
