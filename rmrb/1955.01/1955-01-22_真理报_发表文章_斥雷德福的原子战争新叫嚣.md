Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th: V. Chichikov wrote in the "People's Daily" on the 19th regarding the remarks made by U.S. Admiral Radford about the U.S. being prepared to use atomic bombs in Korea should war break out again there: This statement has aroused the indignation of all the Korean people. Even members of the South Korean Lee Seung-man National Assembly have had to protest against the sinister intentions of the U.S. military representatives.

Chichikov pointed out that a huge wave of protests against this new atomic war clamor has swept across many countries, causing confusion among powerful American groups and Pentagon leaders. When foreign reporters asked General Hull, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces, to comment on Radford's remarks, he found it best to refuse. Some articles have appeared in American newspapers, secretly helping Radford to get out of his predicament. However, no newspaper's efforts to exonerate Radford have been successful.

It would be appropriate to call the attention of this American admiral to the Stockholm Appeal. This declaration has received strong support from hundreds of millions of ordinary people around the world. People of all countries consider those who threaten the world with atomic bombs to be war criminals.

Radford's compatriot, General Stevenson, recently listed himself as one of the candidates for war criminals because he boasted that he was ready to dispatch atomic bombers from American bases in Britain immediately upon notification, in order to carry out atomic attacks on peace-loving countries. It seems that Stevenson's "fame" has made Admiral Radford unwilling to remain silent. Well, the people of all countries will remember the names of all those who are eager to add their names to the list of war criminal candidates.

    “真理报”发表文章
    斥雷德福的原子战争新叫嚣
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：维·奇奇科夫十九日在“真理报”就美国雷德福海军上将发表的关于一旦朝鲜发生战争时美国准备在朝鲜使用原子弹的谈话写道：这个谈话已激起了朝鲜全体人民的愤慨。即使南朝鲜李承晚国会中的议员们也不得不抗议美国军事代表的这种罪恶意图。
    奇奇科夫指出，抗议这种原子战争新叫嚣的巨浪席卷许多国家，已引起了有势力的美国集团和五角大楼首脑们的混乱。当外国记者要求联合国军总司令赫尔将军就雷德福的谈话发表意见时，他发现最好的办法是拒绝。美国报纸出现了一些文章，暗中协助雷德福摆脱困境。但是没有一家报纸为雷德福洗刷的努力能够成功。
    叫美国这位海军上将注意一下斯德哥尔摩宣言将是适宜的。这个宣言得到全世界亿万普通人民的强烈拥护。各国人民认为以原子弹威胁世界的人都是战犯。
    雷德福的同胞史蒂文森将军最近已把自己列为战犯候补人之一，因为他夸口已准备好在一接到通知后，立刻从英国的美国基地出动原子轰炸机，以便对爱好和平的国家进行原子攻击。看来，史蒂文森的“声名”使雷德福海军上将也不甘缄默。那么好罢，凡是急于想把自己名字添到战犯候补人名单中去的人，各国人民都会记得他们的名字。
