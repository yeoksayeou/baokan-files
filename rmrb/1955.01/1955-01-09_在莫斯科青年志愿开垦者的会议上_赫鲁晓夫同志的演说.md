Comrades, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, I extend my greetings to you and wish you the best of achievements in your labor of benefiting our great Soviet motherland.

Comrades! Your decision to reclaim wasteland and to reinforce with your labor those who volunteered to work in the reclaimed areas ahead of you is a very good one. At our meeting today, representatives from the reclaimed areas have already spoken. Last year, when we talked about these reclaimed areas, it seemed as if they were farther away from Moscow than they are today. At that time, few Muscovites had been to the remote regions of Kazakhstan and Altai, so everyone did not have a specific and clear understanding of these regions.

Now the situation is different. Tens of thousands of people have gone to the reclaimed areas, they have settled there, they are working well there, and they have sent letters. It is true that the content of the letters is varied, and there are individual complaints, which should be pointed out. However, most of the letters are full of vigor, and people express their firm belief that they will be able to successfully complete the tasks entrusted to them.

These letters are very meaningful documents at present. They illustrate the radiant spirit of our glorious youth who went to reclaim wasteland. Therefore, it is easier for the Communist Youth League to talk to young people today and call on them to learn from the example of those who went to Siberia and Kazakhstan last year to reclaim vast grasslands. This is very good.

I think that this year we will basically be able to complete the work of transferring cadres to the new state farms and machine tractor stations in the reclaimed areas. Comrades, is it correct for us to do this, or is it correct to leave this work until next year? (Someone in the audience shouted: We must finish it this year!)

Yes, it is obviously right to finish it this year. This is very important for the country. You know, the Party and the government plan to reclaim 28 million to 30 million hectares of wasteland before 1956. I would like to draw your attention to the number 30 million, which is better than 28 million, because it is larger than the latter, so we can harvest more grain (applause).

In my opinion, none of us would doubt that these lands will be reclaimed. This year, we will reclaim and sow about 20 million hectares of wasteland, and there are still 10 million hectares left. But when we have planted crops on 20 million hectares of land, it will not be difficult to reclaim the remaining land. In this way, our country can increase its sown area by 30 million hectares by next year. Comrades, 30 million hectares is a big deal, a huge increase to the existing sown area.

While we are reclaiming wasteland, we must also think of ways to reclaim poorly grown grasslands in the old areas and plant high-yielding grains and other crops. In this way, we can greatly increase the next harvest of grain, potatoes, vegetables, and industrial raw material crops.

Comrades, I would like to talk about my impressions. As you know, I went to the wasteland reclamation areas of Kazakhstan, Altai, Novosibirsk Oblast, and Omsk Oblast last year. I lived in Ukraine for many years, and my childhood was spent there, so I know the richness of Ukraine. I always thought it would be difficult to find land in the Soviet Union richer than Ukraine! But, comrades, the land in Kazakhstan and Altai is much richer! Of course, this does not refer to all the land in Kazakhstan and Altai. There are also some not-so-good lands there, but on the whole, the fertile land here is much wider than in Ukraine.

However, such fertile land has so far been the world of rabbits and wild goats. These wastelands should have been reclaimed long ago. Some people say that there is very little rainfall there. However, the rainfall in southern Ukraine is by no means more than there. Therefore, this statement cannot stand up to rebuttal. The only reason that can be given is that there are too few people there, and some areas are uninhabited at all. But, with your active support, and with the support of the youth of our country, this difficulty can be overcome.

It should be said that people have noticed the wasteland a long time ago. During the Tsarist rule, some people wanted to use the wasteland. But the result was nothing. Because Russia under the capitalist system could not mobilize people to reclaim wasteland. Under our Soviet system, the situation is different. The Soviet people have established a strong industry, and industry is equipping agriculture with a large number of machines. The Soviet people fully understand that reclaiming wasteland is to strengthen our country's strength and to improve the people's living welfare. The soaring enthusiasm of the youth comes from this. The youth can use the large number of machines that the country has transported to the reclaimed areas to carry out productive labor. The state has transported tens of thousands of tractors, combine harvesters, and other machines to the reclaimed areas. The Communist Youth League members and our glorious youth have enthusiastically responded to the Party's call.

It is worth noting that those who go to reclaim wasteland are all young people. All those who go there directly participate in production. You know, it takes many people to go to the wilderness where there are neither houses nor essential supplies. Young lads and girls can endure these temporary difficulties more easily than a large family going there. Communist Youth League members Lomteva and Kasatkin, who are already working in the reclamation areas, spoke at the meeting. The severe cold there inspires them. It is clear that the days they spent there were not as happy as they are telling us today. But people are working there tirelessly. They know that our past undertakings were more difficult than the present ones. Everyone recalls where the soldiers rested during wartime? They fought there and rested there. If the country needs it, our people will spare no effort. We are very pleased to see those who have reclaimed the land with their labor speak on this stage. We cannot abandon these lands in a year or two. We should settle down there and settle down there forever. So, I hope you will start families there (applause).

What does it mean to start a family? This means that a person wants to start a family and settle down in a new place. Such a person who starts a family is a good citizen. The more people we have in our country, the stronger our country will be. Bourgeois thinkers have created many man-eating theories, one of which is the theory of overpopulation.

They are thinking about how to reduce the birth rate and reduce the population growth rate. Comrades, for us, things are quite different. Two hundred million people plus another hundred million, we still think it is not enough!

I would like to take this opportunity to talk about a problem. Some comrades blame us, saying that the law on levying taxes on single people and childless people that was promulgated in the past seems to be a bad law. Comrades, if you want to scold someone for coming up with this law, then mainly scold me. This law was my suggestion. Comrade Malenkov is here, and he can prove it. I suggested to Comrade Stalin to draft and promulgate such a law. Later, such a law was drafted and approved. I think this is a correct law. Do not look at it from a narrow perspective, but from the perspective of the country. What does the law stipulate? If you do not have children, or only have one or two children, then you have to pay taxes. Why? This is because, if each family only has one or two children, then our country's population will not increase, but will decrease. But, we should consider the development of society. Therefore, a family should have at least three children and raise them well (sustained applause)!

Someone asked: Why should those who only have two children, especially those who have no children, pay taxes? We have some people, these people either do not get married at all, or they do not have children after marriage. We are not prepared to study the reason for this now. But, these people live in society and enjoy all the benefits of society. Then, people gradually get old. May I ask, when he loses his ability to work, who will take care of him? Isn't it the youth raised by those outstanding mothers with many children? It is because of this that Comrade Stalin suggested giving subsidies to families with many children. So, where does the money come from? It is borne by those who are alive and do not think about the future. And we should think about the future, we should think about our socialist society, think about the development of this society. Then, we must consolidate our socialist society, make it deeply rooted, so that no force can pull up the roots of socialist society.

Comrades, it can be seen that the tax law for single people and childless people is indeed a correct and good law, and this law is good for our country.

I would like to go back and talk about the issue of reclaiming wasteland. The land in the eastern part of our country is fertile. You must go further east from Altai. How good the land in Krasnoyarsk Krai must be! When we think of Siberia, we often have in our minds the scenes described in various good and bad literary works. Most of these works depict Siberia as a place where prisoners were exiled during the Tsarist era. People are influenced by this description, and sometimes they have a completely incorrect concept of these areas. Let's take Krasnoyarsk as an example again. This is a krai where there has never been a drought, and it has fertile land!

Comrades, I recently went to the Far East and visited the Khabarovsk Krai. This is the richest krai, but the population of this krai is not large, and it still needs to be reclaimed. At present, we transport potatoes from Omsk to Sakhalin Island, but the fertile land in the neighboring Khabarovsk Krai is left unused, and these lands can yield very high harvests. On these lands, potatoes, rice, soybeans, corn, watermelons, and melons can be produced. As long as you sow on these lands, crops will grow, and grow well. But now these lands are not used very well.

What about Vladivostok? Comrade Bulganin and Comrade Mikoyan and I went to Vladivostok not long ago when we returned from visiting China. It's a mythical place! It is a very beautiful city built on hills, and the scenery of the bays and islands here is picturesque, a green shade, what a wonderful nature! What a bright sunshine! When we arrived in Vladivostok, you were already shrinking from the cold of early winter here, but we were wearing summer clothes, enjoying the beautiful and clear weather.

You know, as Lenin said, although Vladivostok is far away, it is our own city! In the Primorsky Krai, there is endless potential for developing agriculture, especially for developing animal husbandry. The land in this krai is overgrown with weeds, but, up to now, we still transport meat, butter, and other milk products there. This situation must be changed.

What about Sakhalin Island? That is also a picturesque fertile land, the climate is very good, humid, and it can be said to be a little too humid. But the Soviets live there, and they are not only living, but also working vigorously in a good and very beneficial way.

In short, we must reclaim wasteland in the east more quickly and settle down on these lands.

When we are in Komsomolsk, this young city, and in other new cities in the Far East, when we talk to workers and staff members there, we feel the patriotic enthusiasm of the residents of these new cities particularly strongly. They enthusiastically told how they built their own city! They earnestly asked for help to make their city more beautiful. Many of them were Muscovites who went to build these cities at that time.

This is a good characteristic - developing a love for one's own city! Some of you may say, we don't need to promote it to our young people, we know it ourselves. But there is often this situation: when the tide of patriotism rises, there will be some light things floating up with all the healthy things (laughter in the hall, thunderous applause). When difficulties come, emotions will begin to drop, and then some people may slip back to Moscow. Are we going to welcome you back in disgrace after we have gloriously sent you off (laughter)? Indeed, it will not be glorious to welcome you back!

It is good for you to go to reclaim wasteland. There is a need for vigorous construction there. It is true that many reclaimed areas do not have wood, but you can look at Ukraine, look at our Donets region. You will come across Ukrainians living in adobe houses. I myself used to live in this kind of adobe house, which is warm in winter and always cool in summer. That is its advantage.

Kazakhstan, where many of you are going, has many lakes. This republic is rich in reeds and rushes. This is a valuable material for building houses and various economic structures. You must be good at using it. You must be able to adapt to the environment of the reclaimed areas, and you must build houses well there. You are able to do this. Indeed, in the beginning, there may only be dirt floors. There is no way to do that. As time goes on, we will make wooden floors. As the saying goes, Moscow was not built all at once. You must settle down well, not only set an example in production issues (of course, this is the main thing), but also set an example in life issues.

You should bring your own urban culture to the grasslands, so that others can see at a glance that the people living here are people who have moved from Moscow and are living in an orderly manner. This is very important.

You must establish schools, children's palaces, nurseries, and kindergartens. Just now, a comrade from the reclamation area said that they will have a ten-year school there, and he will go to study there next year. Many of you who have not received secondary education should receive secondary education, this is very important. This must be done, and all conditions are available in this regard. You must receive specialized education and master technology very proficiently. In this way, labor productivity can reach another level, the accumulation of socialist wealth will be another situation, and life will become better.

Comrades! To improve the people's living standards, we must develop agriculture, obtain more food, and obtain more industrial raw materials.

However, it should be known that our country's achievements are due to the victory of the Party's general line, which was formulated by Lenin, and our Party has tirelessly implemented this line under the leadership of Stalin. Our entire Party has implemented it in the past and will continue to implement this line consistently in the future. This is the victory of the national industrialization line. Without the development of heavy industry, without the development of the coal industry, the metallurgical industry, and the chemical industry, without the development of the machine manufacturing industry, we would neither be able to develop our national economy nor be able to guarantee victory in the tests of the war years. We are now surrounded by capitalism, and our achievements will make our friends happy and will also make our enemies tremble.

We should constantly strengthen the strength of our motherland and fight for lasting and enduring peace in the world.

The Soviet people engaged in peaceful labor devote all their strength to the great cause of communist construction. We believe that victory will be ours because we have the teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin to guide us forward!

Our achievements are great. But, we cannot be complacent, we must work better! There is one more thing that we need, and that is more self-criticism. We should not be complacent and think that we have caught up with or surpassed someone. We should demand more of ourselves and make fewer exaggerations. We cannot be satisfied with what has already been done, because what is very good today will not be enough tomorrow. Criticism and self-criticism will eliminate the dust and mildew in our organs. Only in this way can the vigorous young shoots of some advanced things in our economy develop more rapidly.

Just now, Comrade Kasatkin spoke, he went to the reclamation area from the "Barometer" factory. We were very happy to hear that he and his collective won the right to participate in the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition in the first year of their work on the wasteland. I think everyone of you will fight for the right to participate in the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition.

When you go to the reclamation area, do not embarrass the capital, and do not embarrass the collective you originally belonged to. In my opinion, it is even a little wronged if you cannot win the qualification to participate in the exhibition. I think it would be terrible if you didn't support this view. Is that right

 (The hall roared. Applause)?

We have technical equipment, the land is very good, and we have knowledge, and it will become richer in the future. What else is needed? Perseverance. If it doesn't work in one year, don't be discouraged, strive for the second year, and victory will always be guaranteed in the third year. No difficulty is insurmountable as long as he realizes what he is fighting for, and constantly enriches his knowledge and works hard.

What is the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition? It is a national testimony that we can get enough of the various products that the country needs in a short period of time. What are we getting now? The grain harvest is more year by year, but there are still not enough commodities. What is the reason for this? Because the working class is growing every year, wages are increasing, prices are decreasing, and the scope of consumption is expanding. Is this a bad thing? No, this is a very good thing.

However, production must not lag behind the growth of residents' needs.

Work hard, organize labor correctly, and use materials rationally - all this will enable us to successfully complete our tasks in the shortest possible time. In 1955, we should greatly increase the production of agricultural products. We should develop grain production and animal husbandry, and we should increase the production of more vegetables, potatoes, cotton, flax, ramie, and other crops.

Comrades, we wish you greater achievements! We are waiting for your definite news, waiting for your good news of achievements in reclaiming wasteland, in working for the benefit of the motherland, and in consolidating the prosperity of the motherland (stormy and sustained applause, everyone stood up).

### 在莫斯科青年志愿开垦者的会议上  赫鲁晓夫同志的演说

    在莫斯科青年志愿开垦者的会议上
    赫鲁晓夫同志的演说
    同志们，我代表苏联共产党中央委员会向你们致意，并祝你们在造福我们伟大的苏维埃祖国的劳动中，取得最优良的成就。
    同志们！你们决定去开垦荒地，去用自己的劳动增援先你们一步志愿去开垦地区工作的人们，这种决心是很好的。在我们今天的会上，已经有从开垦区来的代表讲了话。去年，当我们谈论这些开垦地区的时候，似乎觉得它离开莫斯科要比今天远些。在那个时候，很少有莫斯科人到过遥远的哈萨克和阿尔泰地区，因此，大家对这些地区都没有一个具体的、清楚的了解。
    现在情况不同了。有成千成万的人到了开垦地区，他们在那里住了下来，在那里工作得很好，并且寄来了信。不错，信的内容是各种各样的，也有个别的是诉苦的信，这点是应该说明的。但是，大多数信是生气勃勃的，人们表示坚信一定能够胜利完成委托给他们的事业。
    这些信是目前很有意义的文件。它们说明了，我们那些去开垦荒地的光荣的青年的精神是焕发的。因此，共青团今天和青年们谈谈话，号召他们学习那些去年到西伯利亚和哈萨克去开垦辽阔的草原的人的榜样，也就比较容易了。这是很好的。
    我想，今年我们基本上就能结束往开垦地区的新国营农场和机器拖拉机站调配干部的工作。同志们，我们这样做正确呢，或是把这项工作留到明年去做正确呢？（会场中有人喊：我们要在今年结束！）
    对，显然是应该在今年结束。这对国家说来是很重要的。你们知道，党和政府计划在一九五六年以前开垦二千八百万到三千万公顷荒地。我请大家注意三千万这个数字，这个数字比二千八百万要好，因为它比后者要大，因而我们能够收获的粮食也就更多（掌声）。
    依我看，我们中间没有人会怀疑这些土地将要被开垦出来。今年，我们要开垦和播种约两千万公顷荒地，剩下的还有一千万公顷。但是，当我们在两千万公顷的土地上种下庄稼后，剩下的土地就不难开垦了。这一来，我们全国到明年就可以增加三千万公顷播种面积。同志们，三千万公顷是一件大事，是对现有的播种面积的一个巨额的增加。
    我们一方面开垦荒地，一方面要在老区中想些办法，开垦长得不好的草地，种上可获丰收的谷物和其他作物。这一来，下次收获的谷物、马铃薯、蔬菜和工业原料作物就可以增加很多。
    同志们，我想谈谈我的印象。大家知道，我去年到哈萨克、阿尔泰、新西伯利亚州和鄂木斯克州的开垦荒地区去了一趟。我在乌克兰住过许多年，我的童年就是在那里度过的，所以我知道乌克兰的富饶。我总以为苏联很难找到比乌克兰更富饶的土地了！但是，同志们，哈萨克和阿尔泰的土地要富饶得多！当然，这里所说的并不是哈萨克和阿尔泰的全部土地，那里也有些不大好的土地，但整个说来，这里肥沃的土地要比乌克兰广阔得多。
    但是，这样肥沃的土地至今一直还是兔子和野山羊的世界。早就应该开垦这些荒地了。有人说，那里雨量很少。然而乌克兰南部的雨量决不比那里多。所以，这种说法是经不起反驳的。能说出来的唯一理由就是那里人口太少，而且有些地区是根本没人居住。但是，在你们积极的支援下，在我们全国青年的支援下，这个困难是可以克服的。
    应该说，老早就有人注意到荒地了。在沙皇统治的时候，就有人想利用荒地。但结果是一无所得。因为，在资本主义制度下的俄国是不能够动员人们去开垦荒地的。在我们苏维埃制度下，情况就不同了。苏联人民已经建立了强大的工业，工业正在以许许多多的机器装备农业。苏联人民十分明白，开垦荒地是为了加强我们国家的实力，是为了提高人民的生活福利。青年们高涨的热情就是从这里产生的。青年们能够利用国家运到开垦地区去的许许多多的机器来进行劳动生产。国家已经往垦荒区运去了几万台拖拉机、联合机和其他机器。共青团员和我们光荣的青年热烈地响应了党的号召。
    值得注意的是，去开垦荒地的都是一些青年。所有到那里的人都直接参加生产。你们知道，需要有许多人到那些既还没有住宅，也还没有必需生活用品的旷野上去。年轻的小伙子和姑娘们，要比一大家人到那儿去容易忍受这些暂时的困难。已经在垦荒地区工作的共青团员洛姆捷娃和卡萨特金在会上讲了话。那里的严寒鼓舞着他们。很明显，他们在那里度过的日子并不像他们今天向我们讲的那么快乐。但是，人们不畏艰苦地在那里工作着。他们知道，我们过去的事业比现在还要困难。大家回想一下，士兵在战时是在什么地方休息的？他们在那儿打仗，就在那儿休息。如果国家需要的话，我国人民是不惜任何力量的。我们很愉快地看到了那些用自己的劳动开垦了土地的人在这个讲台上讲了话。我们不能过一年或两年就把这些土地抛弃了，我们应当在那里安居下来，永远定居下来。所以，希望你们就在那里成家（掌声）。
    什么叫做成家的人呢？这就是说，一个人想建立家庭，在新的地方定居下来。这种成家的人就是一个好公民。我国人口愈多，我们的国家也就愈加强大。资产阶级思想家制造了许多人吃人的理论，其中有一种就是人口过剩论。
    他们在想如何缩小生殖率，减少人口增加率。同志们，对我们来讲，事情却是另外一个样子。两亿人口再加上一亿，我们还嫌少呢！
    我想趁我在这里讲话的机会谈一个问题。有的同志责备我们，说什么过去颁布的对独身者和无子女的人抽税的法律似乎是一条不好的法律。同志们，如果骂谁搞出这条法律来，那主要就是骂我。这条法律是我建议制订的。马林科夫同志在这里，他可以证明。我向斯大林同志建议拟订和颁布这样一条法律，后来，这样的法律制订出来了，并且批准了。我认为，这是一条正确的法律。不要从狭隘的眼光来看它，而要从国家的角度来看它。法律规定了什么呢？你如果没有孩子，或者只有一两个孩子，那你就要纳税。为什么呢？这是因为，如果每个家庭只有一两个孩子，那么我国的人口就不会增加，而且会减少。但是，我们应该考虑到社会的发展。因此，一个家庭至少应该有三个孩子、并且要好好地把他们培养成人（经久不息的掌声）！
    有人问道：为什么那些只有两个孩子，特别是那些没有孩子的人要纳税，这是什么道理呢？我们有这样一些人，这些人或者是根本就不结婚，或者是结婚后没有孩子，我们现在不准备研究这是什么原因。但是，这些人生活在社会里，享受着社会的全部福利。然后，人渐渐老了。试问，当他失去劳动能力的时候，是谁去照顾他呢？还不是那些我们卓越的多子女的母亲们所养育的青年吗。就是因为这样，斯大林同志建议对多子女的家庭给予补助。那么，钱从那里来呢？就是由活着而不想到将来的人负担这种费用。而我们应当想到将来，我们应当想到我们的社会主义社会，想到这个社会的发展。那么，我们就要使我们的社会主义社会巩固起来，根深蒂固起来，使任何力量也不能拔掉社会主义社会的根。
    同志们，可见独身者和无子女的人的纳税法，的确是一个正确的、好的法律，这个法律对我们国家有好处。
    我想回过头来谈谈关于开垦荒地的问题。我国东部的土地是肥沃的。必须从阿尔泰更往东走。克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边疆区的土地该是多么好呀！我们一想起西伯利亚，脑子里就往往浮现出各种好的和坏的文学作品所描写的景象。这些作品多半把西伯利亚描写成沙皇时代流放犯人的地方。人们受到这种描写的影响，有时对于这些地区留下一个完全不正确的概念。我们再拿克拉斯诺雅尔斯克为例。这是一个没有发生过干旱的边疆区，这里有着肥沃的土地！
    同志们，我不久以前曾去过远东，访问过伯力边疆区。这是个最富饶的边疆区，但是这个边疆区的人口还不多，还需要进行开垦。目前，我们把马铃薯从鄂木斯克运送到库页岛，可是邻近的伯力边疆区的肥沃土地却闲置着没有用，而这些土地是能够获得很高的收获量的。在这些土地上，能够出产马铃薯、大米、黄豆、玉蜀黍、西瓜和甜瓜。只要在这些土地上播种，庄稼就能生长出来，很好地生长出来。而现在对于这些土地使用得非常不好。
    海参威呢？我同布尔加宁和米高扬同志在不久以前访问中国回来的时候到过海参威。那是一个神话般的地方！是一个建设在山岗上的非常美丽的城市，这里的海湾和岛屿的风景美丽如画，一片绿荫，多么美妙的大自然！多么明媚的阳光！当我们到海参威的时候，你们在这里已经因初冬的寒冷而感到瑟缩，而我们却穿着夏服，欣赏着美妙清朗的天气。
    要知道，正如列宁所说，海参威虽然遥远，却是我们自己的城市！在滨海边疆区，有着无穷尽的发展农业特别是发展畜牧业的潜力。这个边疆区的土地上野草丛生，然而，我们到目前为止，还往那里输送肉类、牛油和其他的牛奶产品。必须改变这种情况。
    库页岛呢？那也是风景如画的肥沃土地，气候是很好的、潮湿的，也可以说是过分潮湿了一点。但是那边居住着苏联人，他们不仅是生活着，而且是朝气蓬勃地在进行着很好的和很有益的工作。
    总之，我们必须更加迅速地在东部开垦荒地，在这些土地上定居下来。
    当我们在共青团城这个年轻的城市以及在远东其他新的城市中时，当我们在那里和工人们以及职员们交谈时，特别强烈地感触到这些新的城市的居民的爱国热情。他们满怀热情地讲述了他们怎样地建设了自己的城市！他们恳切地请求给予他们帮助，使他们的城市变得更加美好。他们当中有许多人就是在当时前去建设这些城市的莫斯科人。
    这是一个很好的特点——对于自己的城市产生出了热爱！你们中间有谁可能会说，可用不着对我们年轻人宣传了，这些我们自己也知道。但是往往有这种情形：当爱国主义浪潮高涨的时候，随着一切健康的东西浮起来的还会有某种轻漂的东西（会场发出笑声，全场轰然）。困难一来，情绪就会开始低落，于是有的人可能就要溜回莫斯科来了。难道我们光彩体面地欢送你们，而却要垂头丧气地迎接你们吗（笑声）？的确，要我们迎接的时候是不会光彩体面的！
    你们去开垦荒地，这是很好的。那里需要大力地建设。不错，许多垦荒地区没有木材，但你们可以看一下乌克兰，看一下我们的顿尼兹地区。你们会碰到住在土砖屋里面的乌克兰人。我自己过去就曾住过这种土砖房，这种房子冬天暖和，夏天总是凉爽的。它的优点就在于此。
    你们当中许多人将要去的哈萨克有着许多湖泊。这个共和国盛产丛草和芦苇。这是建筑房屋和各种经济建筑物的贵重材料。必须要善于使用它。必须要能适合垦荒地区的环境，必须要在那里很好地建筑房屋。你们是能够这样作的。的确，在开始时，可能只会有泥土的地板。这没有办法。日子一久，我们就会作出木头的地板来。俗话说得好，莫斯科也不是一下子建筑起来的。必须要好好地安居下来，不仅要在生产问题上（当然，这是主要的）作出榜样，而且要在生活问题上作出榜样。
    应当把自己的城市文化带到草原上去，让旁人一下子就可以看出来这里住的是莫斯科搬来的人，住得井井有条。这是很重要的。
    要建立起学校、儿童宫、托儿所和幼儿园。刚才有一位从开垦区来的同志说过，他们那里将有一所十年制学校，明年他就要去学习。你们中间很多没有受过中等教育的人应该受中等教育，这很重要。必须做到这一点，在这方面有着一切条件。必须受专门教育，非常熟练地掌握技术。这样，劳动生产率才能达到另外一种水平，社会主义财富的积累才会是另外一种情况，生活才能会变得更加美好。
    同志们！要提高人民的生活水平，就必须发展农业，获得更多的食品，获得更多的工业原料。
    但是，应该知道，我国之所以获得一切成就，是由于党的总路线的胜利，这一总路线是列宁制订的，我们党在斯大林的领导下不倦地实行了这一路线。我们全党过去执行了，今后仍将一贯执行这条路线。这就是国家工业化路线的胜利。没有重工业的发展，没有采煤工业、冶金工业和化学工业的发展，没有机器制造业的发展，我们就既不可能发展我们的国民经济，也不可能保证在战争的年代的考验中获得胜利。我们现在处在资本主义的包围中，我们的成就会使我们的朋友感到高兴，也会使敌人发抖。
    我们应当不断地加强我们祖国的实力，为全世界巩固和持久的和平而斗争。
    从事和平劳动的苏联人民把自己的全部力量贡献给伟大的共产主义建设事业。我们相信，胜利将是我们的，因为我们有马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林的学说指导我们前进！
    我们的成就是巨大的。但是，我们不能自满，我们必须工作得更好！还有一件东西是我们所必需的，那就是更多地进行自我批评。不应该洋洋得意地认为我们赶上了或者赶过了某人。应该多要求自己，少作些夸张。我们不能自满于已经做的事情，因为，今天这些还是很好的，而到明天这些就不够了。批评和自我批评会消除我们机关中的灰尘和霉斑。只有这样，我国经济中一些先进事物的茁壮的幼芽才能得到更迅速的发展。
    刚才卡萨特金同志发了言，他是从“气压计”工厂到开垦地区去的。我们非常高兴地听到了，他和他的集体在荒地上工作的第一年就取得了参加苏联农业展览会的权利。我想，你们每个人都会为争取参加苏联农业展览会的权利而展开斗争。
    你们去到垦荒地区，不要使首都丢脸，不要使你们原来所在的集体丢脸。依我看，要是不能争取到参加展览会的资格，那甚至是有点委屈的。我看，你们要是不支持这种看法，简直是可怕。是吗
  （大厅哄然。掌声）？
    我们有技术装备，土地是很好的，知识也有，将来还会更加丰富。还需要什么呢？坚忍不拔的精神。一年不成，不要丧气，争取第二年，在第三年里胜利总会有保证。没有任何困难是人所克服不了的，只要他认识到他是在为什么而斗争，并且不断地充实知识，顽强地工作。
    苏联农业展览会是什么呢？它是一个全民的证据，证明我们可以在短短的时期内得到国家所需要的足够数量的各种产品。我们现在得到了什么呢？粮食收成一年比一年多，可是商品依然不够。这是什么原因呢？因为工人阶级每年都在壮大，工资在提高，物价在降低，消费范围在扩大。难道这是坏事吗？不是，这是非常好的事情。
    但是，必须使生产不落后于居民的需求的增长。
    好好地工作、正确地组织劳动、合理地利用物资，——这一切将使我们能在最短期内胜利地完成我们的任务。一九五五年我们应当大大增加农产品的生产。应当发展谷物生产和畜牧业，应当增产更多的蔬菜、马铃薯、棉花、亚麻、苎麻和其他作物。
