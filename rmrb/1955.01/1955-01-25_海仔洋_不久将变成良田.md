The peasants of Shangxi Village, Songxi Township, Hui'an County, Fujian Province, are now reclaiming the “Haizaiyang” which has been abandoned for decades. From morning till night, in this vast and desolate place, there are groups of people reclaiming land to create a better life for themselves. “Haizaiyang” will soon become a fertile field.

“Haizaiyang” was originally a nearly 300 mu (unit of area) of fertile land. More than 40 years ago, local tyrants and bullies destroyed the riverbanks, causing floods to invade year after year, and it has long been a place overgrown with weeds. Now, with the care and help of the Party and the government, the peasants of Shangxi Village are realizing their dream of reclaiming "Haizaiyang".

At present, the peasants of Shangxi Village have dug drainage ditches and built sluice gates in “Haizaiyang”, and at the same time, they have opened two main roads in the central area. More than 70 mu have been reclaimed, and more than 120 mu are still being reclaimed. This year, the reclaimed 200 mu will increase grain production by 50,000 jin (unit of weight).

    “海仔洋”不久将变成良田
    福建惠安松溪乡上溪村农民，现在正在开垦着几十年来荒废的“海仔洋”。每天，从早到晚，在这大片荒凉冷静的地方，都有一堆一堆为创造自己美好生活而开荒的人们。“海仔洋”不久将变成一片肥沃的良田。
    “海仔洋”原是一块将近三百亩的良田，自从四十多年前被当地土豪恶霸破毁溪岸使洪水连年侵入以后，便长期成为水草丛生的地方了；现在，上溪村农民在党和政府的关怀帮助下，正在实现着垦复“海仔洋”的愿望。
    目前，上溪村农民已经在“海仔洋”里，挖了排水沟，筑了水闸，同时又在中心地点开了二条大路，有七十多亩已被垦复起来，一百二十多亩还在继续垦复中。今年这垦复的二百亩，将可增产五万斤的粮食。
