Xinhua News Agency, Rome, January 10th: The Fourth National Congress of the Italian Communist Party opened in Rome on the 9th. 1,143 delegates from all provinces of the country attended the meeting. Communist parties from France, Britain, Hungary, Germany, Bulgaria, Sweden, Belgium, Romania, Austria, Finland, Switzerland, Mexico, and other countries sent delegations to participate.

Eduardo D'Onofrio, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Italian Communist Party, delivered the opening speech. Subsequently, Nannucci, Secretary of the Rome City Committee of the Italian Communist Party, and Morandi, Deputy Secretary of the Italian Socialist Party, delivered congratulatory speeches. Morandi said that the fraternal unity of action between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party is the primary foundation for the Italian working people to achieve victory in the struggle against reactionaries and for the consolidation of peace. He said that this unity of action should be protected like the apple of one's eye and continuously strengthened.

The congress read out congratulatory messages from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which were greeted with warm applause from the participants.

Palmiro Togliatti, General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, delivered a report on behalf of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party entitled "Communists Fight for Freedom, Peace, and Socialism."

In his report, Togliatti first spoke about the achievements made by Italian Communists since the Seventh Party Congress in 1951 in the struggle for peace and the improvement of working people's living conditions. He said: The Italian Communists have made great contributions to the struggle for peace. Communists and Socialists, together with democrats of all factions, have carried out significant work in expanding and consolidating the peace movement.

Subsequently, Togliatti spoke about the international situation. He said that due to the Western countries' stubborn rejection of the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union aimed at consolidating peace, due to the Western countries' attempts to approve the Paris Agreements at all costs, and due to the recent decision by the North Atlantic Alliance Council to pave the way for preparing for an atomic war, the international situation is now becoming more serious and tense. He pointed out that although the struggle to protest and oppose the revival of German militarism treaty has been launched nationwide and in Parliament, the movement has not yet possessed the scale and strength necessary at present.

Togliatti spoke about the domestic political situation. He said: The domestic situation has also sharpened due to attempts by some at home to suppress democratic freedoms and revive fascism. Togliatti particularly emphasized that it is necessary to strengthen work among working people who believe in Catholicism in order to strive for the establishment of a peace government that can take various measures to ease international and domestic tensions.

Togliatti sharply criticized the Scelba-Saragat government, pointing out that this government does not enjoy the trust of the majority of the country and only maintains an unstable majority in Parliament. This government "obsequiously serves the interests of huge monopolistic privilege groups, it rejects various proposals on implementing economic and social reforms beneficial to the working people, it is increasingly subordinate to the most reactionary groups of American imperialism, and under their instructions, it adopts a policy of political discrimination against democratic forces in Italian society, intensifies the cold war against the working people, and accelerates the transformation of the democratic republic into a police state, into a bureaucratic autocratic state." But, despite this, Togliatti said: "The Party is still carrying out intense and regular work throughout the country, or almost throughout the country, is still expanding its organization and consolidating the Party, and is strengthening its influence." Togliatti pointed out that from 1951 to 1954, the number of party members increased from 2,099,720 to 2,145,317. The increase in the number of party members "is a sign of the consolidation of the Party."

Togliatti spoke about the Party's current tasks. He said: The Party's current tasks are to strive for democratic freedoms, oppose monopoly capital, and strive to realize the principles of the Constitution. He said that any attempt to return to dictatorship and fascism can only lead Italy to the prospect of civil war. To prevent this, it is necessary to strive to establish a broad united front of democratic forces, which includes the majority of the Italian people united in the cause of defending peace, democracy, and freedom. Togliatti spoke about the close unity of action between the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, saying that the unity of the two parties is manifested as a traditional and unchanging practice, which has now become, and it can be said has basically become, the constant consciousness of the workers and laborers themselves.

Togliatti said that we are not now demanding the formation of a government in which we participate, but we demand the establishment of a government in which representatives of the working people participate, which will implement economic reforms, implement a policy of peace, restore democratic freedoms, and strive to improve the living standards of the masses. Togliatti said that to achieve this goal, "the decisive factor lies in our work, in the work of some political groups and trade union organizations to attract the majority of residents to fight for the realization of this program."

Togliatti's report also talked about Italy's current economic situation and the Party's work in the cultural field and among youth and women.

    意大利共产党第四次全国代表会议开幕
    陶里亚蒂报告党的当前斗争任务
    【新华社十日讯】　据塔斯社罗马九日讯：意大利共产党第四次全国代表会议九日在罗马开幕。出席会议的有全国各省的一千一百四十三个代表。法国、英国、匈牙利、德国、保加利亚、瑞典、比利时、罗马尼亚、奥地利、芬兰、瑞士、墨西哥等国的共产主义政党都派有代表团参加。
    意大利共产党书记处书记爱德华多·多诺弗里奥致开幕词。接着，意大利共产党罗马市委员会书记南努齐和意大利社会党副书记摩兰迪致贺词。摩兰迪说，社会党和共产党的兄弟般的行动一致是意大利劳动人民在反对反动派、争取巩固和平的斗争中取得胜利的首要基础。他说，应当像保护眼珠一样来保护这种行动一致，并不断地加强这种行动一致。
    大会宣读了苏联共产党中央委员会和中国共产党中央委员会的贺电，受到与会者的热烈鼓掌欢迎。
    意大利共产党总书记帕尔米罗·陶里亚蒂代表意大利共产党中央委员会在会上作了“共产党员为争取自由、和平和社会主义而斗争”的报告。
    陶里亚蒂在报告中首先讲到了意大利共产党员自一九五一年第七次党代表大会以来在争取和平、改善劳动者的生活条件的斗争中所取得的成就。他说：意大利共产党员对于争取和平的斗争的贡献是很大的。共产党员和社会党员以及一切派别的民主人士在一起进行了扩大和巩固和平运动的重大工作。
    随后，陶里亚蒂讲到国际局势。他说，由于西方国家顽固地拒绝了苏联提出的旨在巩固和平的建议，由于西方国家企图不顾一切地批准巴黎协定，由于北大西洋联盟理事会在不久以前作出了为准备原子战争铺平道路的决定，现在，国际局势趋向更加严重、更加紧张了。他指出，虽然抗议和反对复活德国军国主义的条约的斗争已经在全国范围内和议会里展开，但是，运动还没有具备目前所必要的规模和力量。
    陶里亚蒂谈到国内政治局势。他说：由于国内有人企图镇压民主自由和复活法西斯主义，因而国内的局势也尖锐化了。陶里亚蒂特别强调说，必须加强在信奉天主教的劳动人民中间的工作，以便争取建立一个能够采取各种措施以缓和国际和国内紧张局势的和平政府。
    陶里亚蒂尖锐指责谢尔巴—萨拉盖特政府，指出这个政府得不到全国大多数人的信任，而只在议会中保持一个不稳定的多数。这个政府“奴颜婢膝地为巨大垄断特权集团利益服务，它拒绝关于实施有利于劳动人民群众的经济和社会改革的各种建议，越来越从属于美帝国主义最反动的集团，在他们的指示下，在意大利社会中采取打击民主力量的政治歧视政策，加剧对劳动人民的冷战，加速使民主共和国变为一个警察的国家，变为一个官僚专制的国家。”但是，尽管如此，陶里亚蒂说：“党仍然在全国，或者差不多是在全国范围内进行了紧张和经常的工作，仍然扩大了它的组织和巩固了党，并且加强了它的影响。”陶里亚蒂指出，从一九五一年到一九五四年，党员人数从二百零九万九千七百二十人增加到了二百一十四万五千三百一十七人。党员人数的增加“是党的巩固的标志”。
    陶里亚蒂谈到党在当前的任务。他说：党的当前任务是争取民主自由、反对垄断资本、争取实现宪法的原则。他说，打算退回到独裁和法西斯主义的任何企图只能使意大利面临内战的前途。要防止这一点，就必须争取建立广泛的民主力量的统一战线，这个统一战线要包括在保卫和平、民主和自由的事业中团结起来的大多数意大利人民。陶里亚蒂谈到共产党同社会党的紧密的一致行动，他说两党的团结表现为一种传统的和不变的惯例，这种传统和惯例现在成为，而且可以说基本上已经成为工人和劳动者自己经常的觉悟。
    陶里亚蒂说，我们现在并不要求组成一个有我们参加的政府，但是，我们要求成立一个有劳动人民代表参加的政府，这个政府要实行经济改革，实行和平政策，恢复民主自由，致力于提高群众的生活水平。陶里亚蒂说，要达到这一目的，“决定性的因素在于我们的工作，在于一些政治团体和工会组织为吸引大多数居民为实现这一纲领而奋斗的工作。”
    陶里亚蒂的报告还谈到意大利的目前经济情况以及党在文化领域、青年和妇女群众中间的工作。
