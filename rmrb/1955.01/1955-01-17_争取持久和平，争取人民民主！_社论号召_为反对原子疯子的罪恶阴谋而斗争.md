Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, January 14th: "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" published an editorial entitled "Struggle Against the Heinous Conspiracy of Atomic Maniacs—The Cause of People of All Countries."

The editorial said: Peace-loving people all over the world cannot but feel strong concern and indignation at the aggressive blocs of the United States and other Western countries stepping up preparations for a new war using weapons of mass destruction. World opinion learned with indignation that the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council, at its recent Paris meeting, approved the formulation of a plan for atomic warfare in Europe, and in fact gave American generals the "right" to arbitrarily decide when and where to use atomic bombs. At the same time, the ruling groups of the United States and Britain are doing everything possible to force Western European countries to accept the London and Paris agreements. The ruling groups of Western countries intend to hand over atomic weapons to Hitler's executioners through these agreements. The US President also directly stated in his recent "State of the Union Address" that the United States will continue to pursue a policy of stepping up the expansion of armaments, and will particularly focus on the use of "new weapons, especially new weapons with rapid and destructive attack power."

The editorial then pointed out: The Soviet Union has been consistently striving to ensure that atomic energy is used entirely for peaceful purposes. The first Soviet atomic energy industrial power station has already been put into production. At the same time, the Soviet Union has consistently advocated internationally the prohibition of atomic weapons and advocated the permanent elimination of this weapon from the armaments of all countries.

The editorial pointed out: Hundreds of millions of men and women in all countries of the world have already signed the Stockholm Appeal demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons. Since then, the people's will to realize this demand has become stronger. Prominent public figures and politicians and millions of people in Japan, Britain, France, Germany, India and other countries are protesting against plans to launch an atomic war.

The editorial said: The new situation that has emerged is that, due to the adventurous policies of the heads of the North Atlantic Group, the danger of launching an atomic war is much greater than before. This requires all peace-loving people to redouble their efforts to prevent this threat to mankind. Peace-loving people of all countries can and must stop these atomic maniacs and force them to abandon their heinous plans. In this regard, the conference to demand the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons to be held in Tokyo on January 16 is of great significance. This conference will discuss the proposal to hold an international gathering in Hiroshima on August 6 this year against the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons. The editorial pointed out: The resolute mass actions of peace advocates and the situation in which millions more people with extremely diverse political views and social status are participating in the struggle to ban atomic weapons will help to shatter the conspiracy of the American atomic maniacs. The editorial said: Only when the people of all countries resolutely take on the cause of peace and defend it to the end can this threat to mankind be eliminated.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”社论号召
    为反对原子疯子的罪恶阴谋而斗争
   【新华社十六日讯】据罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特十四日讯：“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”发表社论，题目是“为反对原子疯子的罪恶阴谋而斗争——世界各国人民的事业”。
    社论说：全世界爱好和平的人民对于美国和其他西方国家的侵略集团加紧准备使用大规模毁灭性武器的新战争的阴谋，都不能不感到强烈的关怀和愤慨。世界舆论愤慨地得知，侵略性的北大西洋公约集团理事会在最近的巴黎会议上批准制订在欧洲进行原子战争的计划，并且事实上给予美国将领任意决定在何时何地使用原子弹的“权利”。同时，美国和英国的统治集团正无所不用其极地来迫使西欧国家接受伦敦和巴黎协定。西方国家的统治集团打算通过这些协定把原子武器交给希特勒刽子手。美国总统在最近的“国情咨文”中也直接表示，美国将继续推行加紧扩充军备的政策，并且特别侧重使用“新武器，特别是具有迅速的和毁灭性的攻击力量的新武器”。
    社论接着指出：苏联一直在坚持不渝地努力保证把原子能完全用于和平用途。苏联第一个原子能工业电力站已经投入生产了。同时，苏联又坚持不渝地在国际上主张禁止原子武	主张从各国的军备中一劳永逸地取消这种武器。
    社论指出：世界各国亿万男女已经在要求禁止原子武器的斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名。此后，人民争取实现这个要求的意志更加坚强了，日本、英国、法国、德国、印度和其他国家著名的公众人士和政界人士和千百万人民都在对发动原子战争的计划提出抗议。
    社论说：现在出现的新情况是：由于北大西洋集团的头子的冒险政策，发动原子战争的危险要比以前大得多了。这就要求一切爱好和平的人民加倍努力来防止对人类的这种威胁。爱好和平的各国人民能够而且必须制止这些原子疯子，迫使他们放弃他们的罪恶计划。在这方面，定于一月十六日在东京举行的要求禁止原子武器和氢武器大会具有重大意义。这个大会将讨论今年八月六日在广岛举行一个反对使用原子武器和氢武器的国际性集会的建议。社论指出：和平拥护者的坚决的群众性行动和又有千百万具有极其多样的政治见解和社会地位的人参加禁止原子武器的斗争的局面，将有助于粉碎美国原子疯子的阴谋。社论说：只有世界各国人民坚决地把和平事业担当起来并且把它保卫到底的时候，才能消灭这种对人类的威胁。
