To Siberia!

    The initiative launched by Moscow youth to participate in reclamation work in the development areas of the Soviet East and Southeast has been enthusiastically responded to by young people across the country. The slogan "To Siberia!" is stirring the patriotic enthusiasm of young people, and the number of applicants to participate in reclamation work is increasing daily and hourly.

    Around January 9th, 6,500 young men and women in Moscow City and Moscow Oblast had already requested to go to reclaim wasteland. In the Ukrainian Republic, as of the 8th, 15,000 people had applied to the Communist Youth League organizations to participate in reclamation work. All 120 graduates of a driver's school in the Kuban region recently applied to work in the reclamation areas. In the Byelorussian Republic, as of the 8th, the number of volunteers applying to participate in reclamation work also reached 15,000. Communist Youth League members and young people in Minsk, the capital of the Republic, held a rally on the 8th of January. When they spoke at the meeting, they all expressed their fervent desire to work loyally and selflessly in the reclamation areas. In addition, in the Georgian, Azerbaijani, Turkmen, Kazakh and other republics, an increasing number of young men and women are applying to go to the reclamation areas.
