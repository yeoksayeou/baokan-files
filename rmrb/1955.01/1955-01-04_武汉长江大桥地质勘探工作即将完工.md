As the waves of the Yangtze River begin to calm down with the arrival of the dry season, the underwater geological survey work for the Wuhan Bridge is about to be completed. This survey work was initiated by the Central Ministry of Railways in March 1950. After June of last year, the Central Ministry of Geology and the Ministry of Water Resources dispatched a large number of outstanding staff from famous construction sites such as the Guanting Reservoir to participate in this work. From then on, the design and survey work of the bridge entered a stage of comprehensive development.

Geological surveyors from all over the country, who had lived on land for a long time in the past, bravely persisted in their work under the unprecedented high water levels last year. In order to insert the casing into the deep riverbed, workers salvaged floating debris on the turbulent river surface. Often, groups of venomous snakes were found in the floating debris, so people had to fight with venomous snakes every day. At that time, the Yangtze River was subjected to gales of force six or seven more than once, and the pontoons where the geological surveyors worked were often dangerously situated amidst the raging waves, but they always stuck to their posts.

The geological survey work of the Wuhan Bridge was carried out based on eight plans successively. Up to now, drilling has been completed for 189 boreholes, with a total depth of over 3,500 meters. The completion of these works has decisive significance for the alignment and design of the bridge. Now, the drilling rigs parked on the pontoons in the heart of the river are working on the last batch of boreholes, and the underwater survey work of the Yangtze River will soon be successfully completed.

    武汉长江大桥地质勘探工作即将完工
    当长江的波涛因为落水期到来而开始逐渐平静的时候，武汉大桥的水下地质勘探工作即将全部完工。这个勘探工作早在一九五零年三月就由中央铁道部着手进行普查。在去年六月以后，中央地质部、水利部又从官厅水库等著名工地派来了大批优秀的职工参加这一工作。从那时起，大桥的设计勘探工作即进入全面开展的阶段。
    来自全国各地的地质勘探人员，过去都长期在陆地上生活，但去年却在百年未有的高水位下英勇地坚持工作。为把套管插入深邃的江底，工人们曾在湍急的江面上打捞浮漂物。浮漂物中往往毒蛇成群，因而人们天天必须和毒蛇搏斗。那时候长江曾经不止一次受到六、七级大风的侵袭，地质勘探人员们工作的趸船在惊涛骇浪中常常凶险丛生，但他们始终坚持着自己的岗位。
    武汉大桥的地质勘探工作先后曾根据八个方案进行。到目前为止，已经完成了一百八十九个钻孔的钻探，总计深度达三千五百余公尺。这些工作的完成，对于大桥的选线和设计有着决定性的意义。现在停泊在江心的趸船上的钻机正在最后一批钻孔上工作，长江水下的勘探工作很快就要胜利完成了。　（本报武汉记者站）
