    Anhui Yangtze River embankment reconstruction projects have commenced successively before the new year. After all the riverfront projects in Anqing Prefecture started, the number of laborers working on the embankments reached over 250,000, clearing more than 7,000 potential hazards. Sixteen polder districts in Wuhu and Chuxian Prefectures, including Fanchang County, have also successively started work. In Wuhu Prefecture, over 200,000 laborers have taken to the embankments. The Wuwei Dyke, which is related to the lives and properties of millions of people in seven counties and one city, will also be fully put into operation.
    Among the laborers on the embankments in various places, members of agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams account for a large proportion. Among the 270 laborers in Zenshan Township, Tongcheng County, 265 are organized farmers. All 50 members of Yan Shangxian's team in Yihe Township, Fanchang County, are organized farmers, and the vast majority are young and middle-aged adults. The laborers are in high spirits after going to the embankments. Within two days, 20,000 laborers from Xiang'an, Niubu and other districts of Wuwei County completed arduous tasks such as clearing the foundation, cleaning the lake, and dredging silt on the Wuwei Dyke. The 2,500 people in Xiang'an Brigade shoveled sand and sod over 87,000 square meters in two days. (Jiang Jiezi, Zhao Yumin)

    安徽省长江复堤工程已在年前陆续开工。安庆专区沿江工程全部开工后，上堤民工达二十五万多人，已清除了七千多处隐患。芜湖、滁县两专区所属繁昌等十六个圩区县份也已陆续开工。芜湖专区已有二十多万民工上堤。关系着七县一市数百万人民生命财产的无为大堤也将全部动工。
    在各地上堤民工中，农业生产合作社社员和互助组组员占很大比重，桐城县甑山乡的二百七十个民工中就有二百六十五人是组织起来的农民，繁昌县义合乡严尚贤分队五十个队员全部是组织起来的农民，而且绝大部分都是青壮年。民工上堤后，情绪很高。无为县襄安、牛埠等区的两万民工上无为大堤两天内，就完成了清基清湖淤等艰巨工作，襄安大队两千五百人，两天就扒沙、铲草皮达八万七千多平方公尺。　　（江介子、赵育民）
