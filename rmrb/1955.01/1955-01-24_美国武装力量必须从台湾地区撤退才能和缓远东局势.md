    Since the Chinese People's Liberation Army liberated Yijiangshan Island, the American aggressive bloc, which has been actively carrying out aggression and preparing for war in the Far East, has suddenly seemed to become peace-loving. Official figures in Washington are trying hard to convince the world that it is the actions of the Chinese people to liberate the coastal islands and Taiwan that have caused the tension in the Far East. And for the sake of peace in the Far East, it is said that it would be best for the United Nations to come forward to "mediate" and demand that the Chinese people "cease fire." On January 19, US President Dwight Eisenhower issued this argument at a press conference. A day earlier, Dulles had made similar remarks at a press conference.
    In this way, the American aggressive bloc admits that there is currently a tense situation in the Far East. But is the cause of this tension, as the United States says, due to the Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan?
    Taiwan is Chinese territory. This has not only long been recognized by the "Cairo Declaration," the "Potsdam Proclamation," and many official documents of the US government, but Dulles also affirmed this point in the notes exchanged with Ye Gongchao, the so-called foreign minister of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit group, on December 10 last year. On August 25, 1954, a British Foreign Office spokesman also said: "The Cairo Declaration states that Taiwan should be returned to the Chinese government – this has already been done." From these facts, it is clear that the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan and Penghu is entirely China's internal affair, and no one can interfere. The Chinese people exercising sovereignty over their own territory cannot possibly cause tension in the international situation, nor will it affect peace in the Far East. Since 1947, the Chinese people have been carrying out a liberation war to eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, liberating the Chinese mainland, Hainan Island, and a large number of islands such as the Zhoushan Islands and the Shengsi Islands. These actions of the Chinese people have never caused tension in the Far East, nor have they affected peace in the Far East. Therefore, no one has ever thought that a "mediation" or "ceasefire" plan should be proposed to interfere in China's internal affairs and infringe upon China's sovereignty.
    Taiwan and Penghu, like other islands, are Chinese islands, and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique only has some remnant soldiers and defeated generals left. If the United States had not announced the occupation of Taiwan with the Seventh Fleet in June 1950, Taiwan and Penghu would have been liberated by the Chinese people years ago. The Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan, like the liberation of Hainan Island and the Zhoushan Islands, simply cannot be said to be creating a tense situation in the Far East.
    It can be seen that the cause of the tension in the Far East and the obstruction of peace in the Far East does not lie in the Chinese people's desire to liberate Taiwan, but in the United States' occupation of China's territory Taiwan with its armed forces.
    The reason why the United States wants to occupy Taiwan is not only to facilitate the aid and direction of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in carrying out harassing and destructive wars against the Chinese people, but also to use Taiwan as its base of aggression to prepare for a larger-scale war of aggression against China. It is these aggressive aims of the United States that have made the situation in the Taiwan region increasingly tense and the danger of war in the Far East increasingly imminent.
    Now, official figures in Washington are asking the United Nations to come forward to "mediate" and "ceasefire," and to ask the Chinese people to stop the actions of liberating the coastal islands and liberating Taiwan. This is actually asking the Chinese people to recognize that the United States' occupation of Chinese territory Taiwan is "legal," to recognize that the United States can invade China, and to recognize the so-called "two Chinas" approach that some people are plotting to split China. Obviously, this approach is actually an attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs and expand aggression against China under the banner of the United Nations, and is intended to aggravate the current tense situation and expand the war, rather than to achieve peace in the Far East. The Central News Agency of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique quoted a Washington diplomatic observer on the 19th as saying:
  "If the United Nations proposes a ceasefire and Communist China ignores it, the United States will have the moral support of the United Nations to enforce the mutual defense treaty between the Republic of China and the United States, and may even receive military assistance from the United Nations if Taiwan is attacked by the CCP." Kyodo News Agency of Japan commented on the intention of the United States' so-called "UN mediation ceasefire" on the 20th and also pointed out that "the United States is trying to get the United Nations to intervene in the civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party."
    In fact, at the same time that US officials issued the argument of UN "mediation" and "ceasefire," the United States is actively preparing for new war provocations. According to US news agencies, the US government is considering asking Congress to authorize the use of naval and air forces to "defend" Taiwan and assist the Chiang bandit troops entrenched on the coastal islands in participating in the military operations of the Chiang bandit troops on the coastal islands. This shows that the United States wants to interfere in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan and wants to interfere in the Chinese people's liberation of the coastal islands. According to the United Press, three US aircraft carriers have sailed to the Taiwan region to carry out threats. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique will also hold emergency consultations with US naval personnel. All this shows that Washington's "peace" posture is entirely an attempt to cover up its war behavior.
    The tense situation in the Far East must be eased, and the Chinese people are making resolute efforts for this purpose. But as the Chinese proverb says: "The one who tied the bell must untie it." Since the tense situation in the Far East is caused by the US aggressive action of occupying Taiwan, if the United States is truly concerned about peace in the Far East, it must immediately withdraw its armed forces from the Taiwan region. This is the way to ease the tense situation in the Far East. In addition to this, all methods that actually encourage aggression, split China, and aggravate the tense situation in the Far East will never be agreed to by the Chinese people.

### 美国武装力量必须从台湾地区撤退才能和缓远东局势

    美国武装力量必须从台湾地区撤退才能和缓远东局势
    蒋元椿
    在中国人民解放一江山岛以后，一向在远东积极进行侵略、准备战争的美国侵略集团，忽然变得好像爱好和平起来了。华盛顿的官方人士正在竭力要全世界相信，似乎是中国人民解放沿海岛屿、解放台湾的行动，引起了远东局势的紧张。而为了远东的和平，据说最好是由联合国出面进行“斡旋”，要求中国人民“停火”。一月十九日，美国总统艾森豪威尔在记者招待会上发出了这种论调。在此以前一天，杜勒斯也曾在记者招待会上发表了类似的谈话。
    这样，美国侵略集团是承认目前远东存在紧张局势的了。但是造成这种紧张局势的原因，难道就像美国所说的是由于中国人民一定要解放台湾吗？
    台湾是中国的领土。这不但早为“开罗宣言”、“波茨坦公告”以及美国政府的许多官方文件所承认，就是杜勒斯在去年十二月十日和蒋贼集团的所谓外交部长叶公超交换的照会中也肯定承认了这一点。一九五四年八月二十五日英国外交部发言人也说：“开罗宣言说，台湾应归还给中国政府，——这一点已经做到了。”从这些事实看，中国人民解放台湾、澎湖，当然完全是中国的内政，任何人不能加以干涉。中国人民在自己的领土上行使主权，决不可能引起国际局势的紧张，决不会影响远东的和平。中国人民从一九四七年起就进行了消灭蒋介石卖国集团的解放战争，解放了中国大陆，解放了海南岛和舟山群岛、嵊泗列岛等大批岛屿。中国人民的这些行动从来没有引起远东的紧张局势，没有影响远东的和平，因此，也从来没有人认为应该提出什么“斡旋”“停火”的方案来干涉中国内政，侵犯中国主权。
    台湾和澎湖也同别的岛屿一样是中国的岛屿，蒋介石卖国集团也只剩下了一些残兵败将，如果不是美国在一九五○年六月宣布用第七舰队侵占台湾，台湾和澎湖早在几年前就会被中国人民解放了。中国人民解放台湾，就像解放海南岛和舟山群岛一样，根本谈不上什么造成远东的紧张局势。
    可见，造成远东紧张局势、妨碍远东和平的原因决不在于中国人民要解放台湾，而在于美国用它的武装力量侵占了中国的领土台湾。
    美国之所以要侵占台湾，不但是为了便于援助和指使蒋介石卖国集团对中国人民进行骚扰性和破坏性的战争，而且还为了把台湾作为它的侵略基地来准备更大规模的侵略中国的战争。正是美国的这些侵略目的，使台湾地区的形势日益紧张，使远东战争的危险日益增加。
    现在华盛顿官方人士要求联合国出来“斡旋”“停火”，要求中国人民停止解放沿海岛屿、解放台湾的行动，这实际上就是要求中国人民承认美国侵占中国领土台湾是“合法”的，承认美国可以侵略中国，承认某些人正在策划的割裂中国的所谓“两个中国”的做法。很明显，这种办法实际上就是企图打着联合国的旗帜来干涉中国内政、对中国扩大侵略，就是为了加剧目前的紧张局势，扩大战争，而绝不是为了远东的和平。蒋介石卖国集团的中央社就在十九日引华盛顿外交观察家的话透露：
  “如果联合国提议停火，而共产党中国竟然置之不理的话，这样一来，美国就得到联合国的道义支持来执行中华民国和美国的共同防御条约，说不定在台湾一旦遭到中共攻击的时候，甚至还会得到联合国的军事援助。”日本共同社二十日评论美国的所谓“联合国斡旋停火”的意图时也指出，“美国企图使联合国干预国共内战。”
      事实上，就在美国官方人士发出联合国“斡旋”
  “停火”的论调同时，美国正在积极准备进行新的战争挑衅。据美国通讯社报道，美国政府正在考虑要求国会授权使用海空军“保卫”台湾并协助盘踞在沿海岛屿上的蒋贼军，参与蒋贼军在沿海岛屿上的军事行动。这就表明美国要干涉中国人民解放台湾，要干涉中国人民解放沿海岛屿。据合众社报道说，有三艘美国的航空母舰已经驶往台湾地区去进行威胁。蒋介石卖国集团也将同美国海军人员进行紧急商议。所有这一切都说明：华盛顿的“和平”的姿态完全是企图掩盖它的战争行为。
    远东的紧张局势必须缓和，中国人民正在为了这个目的而进行坚决的努力。但是正如中国俗语所说：“解铃还须系铃人。”远东紧张局势既然是美国侵占台湾的侵略行动所引起的，美国如果真正关心远东的和平，就必须立即从台湾地区撤出它的武装力量。这就是和缓远东紧张局势的办法。除此以外，一切实际上是鼓励侵略、割裂中国、加剧远东紧张局势的办法，中国人民都决不能同意。
