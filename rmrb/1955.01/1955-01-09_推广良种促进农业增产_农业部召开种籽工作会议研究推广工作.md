Promoting Improved Varieties to Boost Agricultural Production
    Ministry of Agriculture Convenes Seed Work Conference to Study Promotion Work
    [By this newspaper] The Ministry of Agriculture convened a seed work conference from December 16th to 25th, 1954. The conference focused on studying the breeding and promotion of improved varieties of grain, cotton, and oil crops, as well as the reserve of seeds for disaster relief and preparedness, and exchanged experiences in seed work from various regions.
    The conference first analyzed the situation of improved variety promotion in our country. It is estimated that by 1954, the planting area of improved varieties of grain and oil crops nationwide had reached over 300 million mu, accounting for approximately 15% of the total planting area of grain and oil crops; the planting area of improved cotton varieties had reached over 55 million mu, accounting for approximately 67.8% of the total cotton planting area. In recent years, various regions have launched mass movements for seed selection, seed retention, and seed exchange, and some agricultural production cooperatives have also established seed retention plots (fields). According to incomplete statistics from various regions, farmers have selected more than 1,300 improved varieties of various crops. Significant increases in production have been achieved in areas where improved varieties have been promoted in accordance with local conditions and corresponding cultivation techniques have been adopted. For example, in 1954, the harvested area of improved wheat varieties such as Bima No. 1, 6028, and Qitouhong in Shaanxi Province accounted for 34% of the total wheat field area. It is estimated that the promotion of improved varieties will increase the province's wheat production by more than 200 million jin. According to a key survey of six villages in Heye County, planting Bima No. 1 wheat seed increased production by 35% compared to local wheat seeds.
    The conference believes that future seed work should adhere to the targets of the improved variety promotion plan formulated by the Ministry of Agriculture, firmly rely on mutual aid and cooperative organizations, vigorously mobilize the masses of farmers to select seeds, retain seeds, and evaluate improved varieties, actively breed and promote existing improved varieties, gradually establish a system for breeding and promoting improved varieties, expand the planting area of improved varieties in a planned manner, and improve and consolidate the yield and quality of varieties, in order to promote agricultural cooperativization and agricultural production increase.
    The conference pointed out that the promotion of improved varieties should focus primarily on seed retention plots (fields) of state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives; when promoting improved varieties to farmers, it is necessary to resolutely implement the principle of "active publicity and education, ensuring farmers' voluntariness." Agricultural departments in various regions should first focus on the breeding and promotion of improved varieties of crops such as grain, cotton, and oil; seed work for other crops should be handled by specialized operating departments. Seed work for different crops in different regions should have different focuses. In addition, the conference pointed out that educating farmers to store and exchange seeds themselves is the main way to solve the problem of seed shortage. The state will also conduct key reserves and timely adjustments in a planned manner, striving to reduce and avoid temporary transportation in times of need.
    The conference also discussed other issues related to seed work and exchanged experiences.

    推广良种促进农业增产
    农业部召开种籽工作会议研究推广工作
   【本报讯】农业部在一九五四年十二月十六日到二十五日召开了种籽工作会议。会议着重研究了粮食、棉花、油料作物优良品种繁育推广和救灾备荒种籽的储备工作，并交流了各地种籽工作的经验。
    会议首先分析了我国推广良种的情况。估计到一九五四年，全国粮食和油料作物良种种植面积已达三亿多亩，约占粮食和油料作物种植总面积百分之十五；棉花良种种植面积已达五千五百多万亩，约占棉花种植总面积百分之六十七点八。几年来各地开展了群众性的选种、留种、换种运动，有些农业生产合作社还建立了留种地（田）。据各地不完全统计，农民已评选出各种作物的良种一千三百多种。凡是因地制宜推广良种并采取相适应的栽培技术的地方，都获得显著增产。如一九五四年陕西省碧玛一号、六○二八号、齐头红等小麦良种的收获面积，占麦田总面积百分之三十四，估计因推广良种，全省可增产二亿多万斤小麦。据郃阳县六个村重点调查，种碧玛一号麦种较当地麦种增产百分之三十五。
    会议认为：今后种籽工作要按照农业部所拟定的推广良种计划指标，坚决依靠互助合作组织，大力发动农民群众选种、留种、评选良种，积极繁育推广现有优良品种，逐步建立良种繁育推广制度，有计划地扩大良种种植面积，提高和巩固品种的产量和质量，为促进农业合作化和农业增产服务。
    会议指出：良种推广应以国营农场和农业生产合作社的留种地（田）为主要对象；向农民推广良种时，必须坚决贯彻“积极宣传教育，做到农民自愿”的原则。各地农业部门应首先做好粮食、棉花、油料等作物的良种繁育推广工作，其他各种作物的种籽工作由专业经营部门办理。不同地区内对不同作物的种籽工作，应有不同重点。此外，会议指出：教育农民自行贮备和互相串换是解决缺种、少种的主要办法。国家并将有计划地进行重点储备和适时调剂，力求减少和避免在需要时临时调运的情况。
    会议还讨论了有关种籽工作的其他问题，交流了经验。
