    The Belief Boiling in Everyone's Heart

    As the car drove out of Gia Lam, the Red River Delta plain after the harvest appeared before our eyes. On a dilapidated roadbed protruding from the plain, thousands of men and women were vigorously carrying out repair work. This is one of the scenes of the railway repair project that people are concerned about, which connects the Vietnamese capital to the Sino-Vietnamese border.

    The Hanoi-Nanning railway repair project began in full swing on October 22, 1954, twelve days after the liberation of Hanoi. What kind of road was in front of people at that time? According to the engineering and technical personnel, except for a small section from Hanoi to An Vien, on the line from An Vien to Nanning, which is more than one hundred kilometers long, not even a single rail was left after the destruction. The entire line was covered with trenches and air-raid shelters, and eighteen of the twenty stations were flattened. The remaining two so-called "better" stations—Lang Son and Dong Dang—had only a few roofless broken dormitories left. All twenty-four bridges, large and small, were damaged, and the curved steel beams that had been immersed in water for a long time were rusted. Many concrete piers had disappeared without a trace. The original communication equipment of this railway only had a few steel pole telephone poles near Lang Son left. On the section of more than forty kilometers from An Vien to Phu Luong Thuong, there were still many steel-concrete bunkers left by the French army; overgrown weeds and tangled barbed wire were intertwined, and there were still landmines that the French army did not remove when retreating.

    Despite this, the people responded to the call of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the government, determined to have trains running on this dilapidated "long embankment" in just a few months.

    At the construction site, I saw people's selfless enthusiasm for labor and a good labor order. Groups of women were quickly removing grass and digging up old gravel in front; another group followed closely behind them, throwing weeds and other debris under the roadbed, sifting out usable gravel with sieves. Another group expanded all the straight walls of the ditches into terraced slopes, cleared the debris in the ditches, and then filled the ditches with new soil carried from afar, letting the workers carrying iron cakes and stone hammers use force to tamp the road surface flat.

    In a thatched shed filled with the clanging of metal, I met a worker named Tran Van Cat. He used to be a worker in an ordnance factory who had won awards three times. Tran Van Cat expressed a common belief boiling in everyone's heart: we must make dilapidated things less and less every day, and make new and beautiful things appear more and more in our country.

  "Even Moving Mountains and Seas, Determination Can Succeed"

    At the busy Hanoi-Nanning railway construction site, I interviewed some people who used to be guerrillas and are now enthusiastically participating in the reconstruction of the motherland. The Vietnamese people thank them and are also proud of their achievements.

    I met Nguyen Trong Tuy, a young man famous throughout the entire line construction site for creating new excavation methods. During the war, Nguyen Trong Tuy was a member of the guerrilla team active in this area. They destroyed telephone lines on the roads and often cooperated with the main forces to attack villages with French bunkers. In the spring of 1952, the French army occupied Ling Ha commune, but the guerrillas did not leave their village. They went out at night and hid during the day, continuing to attack the enemy. That summer, Nguyen Trong Tuy was arrested and imprisoned in Hanoi prison after the enemy discovered his secret hiding hole. He suffered all kinds of hardships, but he didn't say anything. The enemy couldn't find any evidence against him, so they had to release him. After he was released from prison, he continued to fight the enemy.

    After the armistice, President Ho Chi Minh called on people to repair the railway. Nguyen Trong Tuy immediately signed up and came to the railway with other villagers, carrying shovels and dirt baskets. In the excavation work, Nguyen Trong Tuy came up with a clever method. He first dug a large pit, then dug a large trench from the bottom of the pit in all directions, leaving the surrounding soil suspended in the air, and then poured a layer of water on the top of the pit. When they went to work the next day, these soils fell down in large pieces. This increased the efficiency of excavation several times. The people all along the line learned this method, and the roadbed repair project was greatly accelerated.

    This young man said to me: "President Ho said that repairing this road is to restore the country's economy and defend peace. So everyone is not afraid of hardship, not afraid of fatigue, uses their brains to think of ways, and works quickly and vigorously."

    In this arduous project, there are many male and female guerrillas like Nguyen Trong Tuy.

    At a construction site with many women, I met Nguyen Thi Mat, a twenty-three-year-old who everyone praised. During the war, she specialized in transporting military food and conducting communication liaison for the liberated areas. People introduced that she carried soil from 500 meters away to the roadbed, carrying more than 60 kilograms each time, and could make 62 round trips in four hours. When asked if she was tired, she shook her head and said, "Not tired. Everyone's spirits are very high. When I pick up the burden, it's like jogging."

    When talking, everyone often mentioned that they often think of what President Ho said during the war: "Nothing is difficult in the world for one who sets his mind to it; even moving mountains and seas, determination can succeed." They said that when they thought of this, they could do anything.

    I saw two people skillfully building a platform at a station. The captain standing next to him explained that they were originally not construction workers but just ordinary farmers. He said: "A few years ago, when they only knew how to farm, and President Ho wanted them to kill the enemy, they quickly learned how to fight, and they fought very well. Now, President Ho wants them to repair the road, although many things are very unfamiliar, but they will quickly learn. In the future, if President Ho wants them to enter a steel factory or drive a tractor, I think they will also learn quickly."

      Workers from South Vietnam

    At the Hanoi-Nanning railway construction site, there are many workers from South Vietnam. In the past, under the encirclement of the enemy, they tenaciously persisted in the war of resistance in South Vietnam for nearly ten years. Now, in order to consolidate peace and strive for national reunification, independence, and democracy, they have come to the forefront of reconstruction in North Vietnam and are working heroically with the people of the North.

    Twenty-four-year-old worker Le Van Phat was originally a worker in an anti-Japanese ordnance factory in the swampy forest area of Ba Ria province, east of Saigon. During the nearly ten years of difficult days, he constantly manufactured shells, grenades, demolition tubes, and various bullets to supply the troops and fight the invaders. He was awarded by the state during the war of resistance. After the armistice, Le Van Phat, like many workers here, requested to go to the base of national reunification and independence—North Vietnam—to participate in the glorious and arduous reconstruction work. In late September, they followed the Vietnamese People's Army troops withdrawing north from Tram Moc, east of Saigon, to Cen Son.

    Almost as soon as they stepped onto the dock, they asked their comrades in the North: "How about it, where will we be working?"

    The welcoming comrades replied: "Your temporary task is to rest."

    "No!" "No temporary rest. We came to the North to work, not to rest. We had already planned it on the ship, and we will pick up the small hammers as soon as we get off the ship." They finally achieved their wish and came to the construction site of this railway.

    Le Van Phat and his companions were assigned to work at the Hoa River iron bridge construction site, where the steel beams of the iron bridge had been completely lifted into the river. Their job was to straighten the bent steel beams and steel plates. Once, Le Van Phat was hit by someone else's hammer. His eyes flashed with sparks, and he fainted. Ten minutes later, he woke up. He got up, pushed away the nurse and co-workers, picked up the hammer, and started working again.

    Le Van Phat hammered for three full days, straightening a steel plate. After finishing work late on the third night, he couldn't sleep in the middle of the night, thinking: "How can I work faster?" He got up early the next morning. He paced back and forth, stepping on the gravel and straddling the rails. Suddenly, he thought he had a way. Hitting it with a rail would be equivalent to several hammers. After breakfast, he discussed it with several other people and made a frame for hammering steel plates with rails. It wouldn't take two hours to flatten a bent steel plate. In this way, the speed of bridge repair was greatly increased.

    This respectable young man told the reporter that his hometown was Gia Dinh province, south of Saigon. There were gray-haired parents and young siblings at home, who depended entirely on his father's horse-drawn carriage for a living. He had an older brother who had done political work in the People's Army and was later captured by the French army and has not been heard from since. When the armistice came, his mother hoped that her second son would be able to return home to reunite. However, he wrote a letter to his parents: "I am going to the north of the motherland, by President Ho's side, everything will be fine." He asked his parents to wait for the day when they would be permanently reunited.

    When the ship was about to leave Tram Moc, Le Van Phat's mother rushed to the crowded dock. She found her son, whom she hadn't seen for many years, in the crowd, hugged him tightly, but didn't shed tears. She took out a package of black cloth and several boiled eggs from a small basket and stuffed them into Le Van Phat's hands. She said: "Go, Mom won't keep you. We believe in President Ho's words: The compatriots in the South will surely be liberated. When you get to President Ho's side, work harder with your comrades to build the North well, strive for national reunification as soon as possible, and come home to see Mom sooner."

    Le Van Phat stopped here. After a while, he said: "After arriving in the North, it's not that I don't miss my home in the South. But the more I think about it, the stronger my working spirit becomes. I am wholeheartedly doing what my mother told me to do. Now the Americans want to use our South as a base for aggression and divide our country. No one can agree to this. We must work hard, the motherland must be reunified, and we must go home and reunite with our parents!"

    河内—南关铁路修复工地见闻记
    新华社记者　戴澍霖
    沸腾在每一个人心里的信念
    汽车一驶出嘉林，收割后的红河三角洲平原就出现在人们的眼前。在一段破烂不堪的突出在平原之上的路基上，千百个男女正在生气勃勃地进行修复工作。这就是人们所关心的从越南首都通向中越边境的铁路修复工程的场面之一。
    河内—南关铁路的修复工程是从一九五四年十月二十二日即河内解放后的十二天全面开始的。当时，摆在人们面前的是一条什么样子的道路？据工程技术人员说，这条铁路除河内到安员的一小段外，在从安员到南关的一百几十公里长的线路上，被破坏得连一根铁轨也不剩。全线遍布堑壕和防空洞，二十座车站被平毁了十八座，其余两座所谓较
  “好”的车站——谅山和同登的车站，也只剩下几间没有屋顶的破宿舍。大小二十四座桥梁都遭到破坏，长时间浸在水中的弯曲的钢梁已经生锈，很多水泥桥墩连影子也不见了。这条铁路原有的通讯设备，只剩下谅山附近的几根钢柱电线杆。在从安员到府谅商四十多公里的一段线路上，还有法军留下的许多钢骨水泥碉堡；蔓生的荒草和杂乱的铁丝网纠缠在一起，下面还埋有法军在撤退时并没有清除掉的地雷。
    尽管如此，人民响应越南劳动党和政府的号召，决心在短短几个月后，就要在如此破烂的“长堤”上跑起火车来。
    在工地上，我看到了人们忘我的劳动热情和很好的劳动秩序。一群群妇女动作迅速地在前面除草和刨掘旧石子；另一群人紧跟在她们后面，把碎草和其他杂物抛到路基下面，用箩筛选下可用的碎石。还有一组人把所有沟的直壁都向两边扩展成阶台式的斜壁，清除沟内的杂物，然后把从远处挑来的新土填在沟内，让那些提着铁饼和石锤的工人们来用力敲打，把路面压平。
    在一座响着金属的叮当声的茅棚里，我会见了一个名叫陈文吉的工人。他过去是三次得奖的军火工厂的工人。陈文吉说出了沸腾在每一个人心里的一个共同的信念：我们要使破烂的东西一天比一天少，使新的美丽的东西一天比一天多地出现在我们的国家。
  “排山和倒海，决心也能成”
    在一片忙碌的河内—南关铁路工地上，我访问了一些以前是游击队员而现在是热情参加祖国恢复建设的人们。越南人民感谢他们，也以他们的成就而自豪。
    我会见了以创造新的挖掘方法而闻名整个线路工地的青年阮重随。战争期间，阮重随是活跃在这个地区的游击队的队员。他们破坏公路上的电话线，并经常配合主力部队袭击有法军碉堡的村庄。一九五二年春天，法军占领了陵夏社，但是游击队员们没有离开自己的村庄。他们昼伏夜出，继续袭击敌人。当年夏天，阮重随由于藏身的秘密坑洞被敌人发现而被逮捕囚禁在河内监狱里，他受尽苦楚，但是什么也没有讲。敌人因为找不到他的证据，最后只好把他放出来。他在出狱以后继续和敌人战斗。
    停战后，胡志明主席号召人们修复铁路，阮重随立即报名和其他乡邻带着铁锹、土筐到铁路上来了。在挖掘工作中，阮重随想出一个巧妙的办法。他先挖出一个大土坑，然后在坑底向四周挖开一个大沟，让四周的土都悬空起来，然后在坑口上面泼上一层水。第二天上工时，这些土一大块一大块地掉下来了。这使挖掘的效率提高了好几倍。全线民工学习了这种方法，修复路基的工程就大大加快起来。
    这位年青人对我说：“胡主席说修好这条路是为了恢复祖国的经济，保卫和平。所以大家都不怕苦，不怕累，动脑筋想办法，干起来又快又有劲。”
    在这个艰巨的工程中，像阮重随那样的男女游击队员还有很多。
    在一个有许多妇女的工地上，我会见了人人称赞的二十三岁的阮氏末。她在抗战中专门给解放区运送军粮和进行通信联络。人们介绍说：她从五百公尺以外向路基上挑土，每次挑六十公斤以上，四个小时内能来回六十二趟。问她累不累，她摇摇头说：“不累。大家的情绪都很高，挑起担子来就同小跑一样。”
    每个人在谈话时，常常提到他们在工作中时常想起胡主席在战争期间所说的：“天下无难事，只怕心不坚；排山和倒海，决心也能成。”他们说，想到这，他们就什么事都能干了。
    我在一个车站上看见了两个人正在熟练地砌月台。站在身边的大队长解释说：他们原来都不是泥水工人而只是普通农民。他说：“几年前，当他们只知道种地，而胡主席要他们杀敌的时候，他们很快就学会了打仗，而且打得很好。现在，胡主席要他们来修路，虽然许多事情又是很生疏的，然而他们也很快地学会了。将来，如果胡主席要他们进钢铁厂或是去开拖拉机的话，我想他们也一定会很快地学会。”
      从南越来的工人
    在河内—南关铁路工地上，有着许多来自越南南部的工人。过去，他们在敌人的包围下，在南越艰苦地坚持了近十年的抗战。现在，他们为了巩固和平，争取全国统一、独立和民主，又来到了北越恢复建设的前线，和北部的人民一起英勇劳动。
    二十四岁的工人黎文发原是西贡东边巴地省沼泽地带森林中的一座抗战军火工厂的工人。在近十年的艰苦的日子里，不断地制造炮弹、手榴弹、爆破筒和各种各样的子弹供给部队，打击侵略者。他在抗战期间就曾得到国家的奖励。停战以后，黎文发和在这里的许多工人一样，要求到争取祖国统一、独立的根据地——北越来参加光荣而艰巨的恢复建设工作。九月下旬，他们随同北撤的越南人民军部队，从西贡东面的川木到达岑山。
    几乎是一踏上码头，他们就向北部的同志提出：“怎么样，我们将在那里工作呢？”
    欢迎的同志回答：“你们暂时的任务是休息。”
    “不行！”“暂时的休息也不要。我们到北部来是工作的，不是休息的。我们在船上就已盘算好，一下轮船就拿起小锤来。”他们终于达到了愿望，来到了这条铁路的工地。
    黎文发和同伴们被分配在铁桥的钢梁已经完全被掀到河水里的化江铁桥工地上工作。他们的工作是把那些弯了的钢梁、钢板敲直。有一次，黎文发被别人的铁锤撞伤了。他双眼冒火星，昏倒了。十分钟后，他醒来了。他爬起来，推开护士和工友，提起铁锤，就又干起来了。
    黎文发整整敲了三天，敲直了一块钢板。第三天晚上下工后，他半夜睡不着觉，想着：“怎样才能工作得更快一些”。第四天一早，他就起来了。他踏着碎石，跨着铁轨，来回踱着。突然，他觉得有了办法。用铁轨撞一下，要抵得上好几锤。早饭后，他和其他几个人一起商量了一下，做成了一个用铁轨敲打钢板的架子，要不了两个钟头，就可以把一块弯钢板打得服服贴贴。这样，修桥工程的速度就大大地提高了。
    这个可敬的年青人告诉记者说，西贡南边的嘉定省是他的故乡。家里有头发斑白的父母、也有年幼的弟妹，完全靠父亲赶马车过活。他有个哥哥，在人民军中做过政治工作，后来被法军俘掳了去，
  一直没有音信。停战了，母亲指望着第二个儿子能够回家团聚。但是，他写了封信给他的双亲：“我要到祖国的北部去了，在胡主席的身旁，一切都会很好的。”他要他双亲等待永久地团聚在一起的日子。
    当轮船要离开川木的时候，黎文发的母亲赶到了拥挤的码头。她在人群中找到了多年不见的儿子，紧紧地拥抱着他，但是没有流泪，她从小篮子里拿出一包黑布和几个煮熟了的鸡蛋，塞到黎文发的手里。她说：“去吧，妈妈不留你。我们相信胡主席的话：南部的同胞一定会得到解放的。你到了胡主席那边，要和同志们更加努力工作，把北部建设好，争取全国早日统一，早点回家来看看妈妈。”
    黎文发说到这里，停下来了。等了一会，他说：“到北部以后，并不是不想念南方的家的。但是愈想，工作精神愈旺盛，我一心照妈妈的嘱咐做去。现在美国人想把我们的南部作为侵略的基地，分割我们的国家。这是谁也不能答应的。我们必须努力奋斗，祖国一定要统一，我们一定要回家和父母团聚！”
