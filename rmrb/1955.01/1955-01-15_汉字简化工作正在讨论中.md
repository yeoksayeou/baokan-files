    Hanzi Simplification Work Under Discussion
    The Chinese Writing Reform Committee was formally established on December 23rd of last year and has now begun work in eight areas: pinyin schemes, Hanzi consolidation, dialect surveys, vocabulary research, language teaching, technical guidance, editing and publishing, and publicity and promotion. It has also further studied and discussed the "Hanzi Simplification Plan" (draft) initially proposed by the former Chinese Writing Reform Research Committee, and jointly issued this draft to the education departments and bureaus of provinces and cities, as well as other relevant parties, together with the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, to widely solicit opinions. Local education administrative organs are required to organize discussions with a focus on key points, and submit their opinions to the Chinese Writing Reform Committee by the end of February of this year for reference in further revisions. The "Hanzi Simplification Plan" (draft) will be formally discussed and adopted when the National Writing Reform Conference is held this year.

    汉字简化工作正在讨论中
    中国文字改革委员会在去年十二月二十三日正式成立，现已分拼音方案、汉字整理、方言调查、词汇研究、语文教学、技术指导、编辑出版、宣传推广等八个方面开始进行工作。并对前中国文字改革研究委员会初步拟出的“汉字简化方案”（草案）做了进一步的研究和讨论，同中华人民共和国教育部联合向各省市教育厅、局以及其他有关方面发出这一草案，广泛征求意见，要求各地教育行政机关有重点地组织讨论，在今年二月底以前把意见汇集交中国文字改革委员会，作为进一步修改的参考。待今年召开全国文字改革会议时，将正式讨论通过“汉字简化方案”（草案）。
