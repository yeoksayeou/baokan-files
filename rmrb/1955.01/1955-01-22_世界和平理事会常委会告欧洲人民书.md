Title: Appeal to the People of Europe by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council

The people of Europe will never agree to the establishment of a German Wehrmacht.
They oppose the revival of this army, which brought death and destruction to the whole of Europe only ten years after the end of the war.
Today they oppose the idea of handing over atomic weapons to former Hitler generals.
The people will never agree to such a crime.
The ratification of the German Wehrmacht Treaty is far from complete.
In London and Paris, when the parliaments voted on the ratification, less than half of the members of parliament supported these treaties. Governments, like parliaments, have had to acknowledge the opposition of the people in the countries concerned, but they are determined to ignore the opposition of the people of Europe, and in particular the growing opposition of the German people themselves.
The people cannot be bound by decisions taken by parliaments against their will.
Those governments that signed the London and Paris Agreements can no longer conceal the tragic consequences of the establishment of a new German Wehrmacht. The re-militarization of West Germany will lead to the establishment of armed forces in East Germany. The re-militarization of West Germany will intensify the arms race, make it impossible for Germany to be peacefully reunited for many years to come, and make it impossible to establish collective security in Europe.
The World Peace Council calls on the men and women of every country to bring all their strength, all their determination and all their courage to bear to prevent the ratification and implementation of the London and Paris Agreements.
The World Peace Council calls on all men and women who have been waging a great struggle against the rearmament of Germany, and all those who now recognize the imminent dangers of the rearmament of Germany, to unite and redouble their efforts to oppose the revival of German militarism and to strive for European security with the participation of a peace-loving Germany.
With the support of the peoples of Europe, we will not allow a new German Wehrmacht to be imposed upon it.

Vienna, January 19, 1955

    世界和平理事会常委会告欧洲人民书
    欧洲各国人民决不同意建立德国国防军。
    他们反对在战争结束仅十年以后就要使曾经给全欧洲带来死亡和毁灭的这支军队复活。
    他们今天反对关于把原子武器交给前希特勒将领使用的主张。
    各国人民决不会同意这种罪行。
    关于德国国防军条约的批准还远没有实现。
    在伦敦和巴黎，当议会就批准问题进行表决的时候，支持这些条约的议员连一半都不到。政府，同议会一样，不得不承认有关国家的人民所抱的反对态度，但是它们决心不顾欧洲人民的反对，特别是德国人民自己日益强烈的反对。
    各国人民是不能受议会在违反他们的意愿的情况下通过的决定的约束的。
    那些曾经在伦敦和巴黎协定上签字的政府，在今天已经不能再掩饰建立一支新的德国国防军将造成的悲惨后果。西德重新军国主义化将使得在东德建立武装部队。西德重新军国主义化将会加剧军备竞赛，将使得德国在今后许多年内不可能和平地恢复统一，同时将使得不可能在欧洲建立集体安全。
    世界和平理事会号召每一个国家的男女拿出他们一切力量、一切决心和一切勇气，来阻止批准和实施伦敦和巴黎协定。
    世界和平理事会号召一直在进行反对重新武装德国的伟大斗争的全体男女和所有在今天已经认识到重新武装德国所包含的迫切危险的人团结一致，加倍努力来反对德国军国主义的复活，争取在有爱好和平的德国参加下建立欧洲的安全。
    欧洲在各国人民支持之下将不让别人把新的德国国防军强加在它的身上。
    一九五五年一月十九日于维也纳
