Heilongjiang Province Decides to Further Promote Agricultural Cooperativization

[News] In the first quarter of 1955, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has determined to focus the Party's work on the socialist transformation of agriculture. The most important issue currently is to conduct education on the two new and old roads. As of the end of November 1954, there were 21,642 agricultural production cooperatives in the province, with the number of households joining the cooperatives accounting for 34.6 percent of the total number of farm households in the province, an increase of nearly five times compared to a year ago. Agricultural cooperatives have been established in 87.2 percent of the administrative villages in the province, and there are 1,874 basically cooperativized villages and six basically cooperativized counties (i.e., the number of households participating in agricultural cooperatives accounts for more than 50 percent).

The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee believes that the development of agricultural production cooperatives is basically normal and healthy, except for a few areas, and is in line with the laws of development of mutual aid and cooperation. However, due to the lack of meticulousness in the establishment of cooperatives in some areas and the lack of patient ideological education, some cooperative members are still not mentally stable, some cooperative organizations are still chaotic, and winter production has not been organized. Although some areas have established cooperatives, due to the impure leadership composition of the cooperatives, or being influenced by capitalism, they refuse to accept national plans, or collectively conceal production and engage in speculative trading. The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee believes that the above problems must be resolved quickly, and existing cooperatives must be well-managed to lay the foundation for agricultural cooperativization in the province. To this end, the Provincial Committee decided to convene a large-scale rural work conference in the first quarter to educate rural work cadres that they must clearly recognize that in the process of socialist transformation of agriculture, the struggle between the two new and old roads is an extremely sharp and complex class struggle. It is necessary to follow the Party Central Committee's guidelines and policies, grasp the laws of development of mutual aid and cooperation in the province, strengthen education on class policies, strengthen Party leadership, unify thinking, unify steps, and promote the healthy development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. In order to prepare for this meeting, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee has now begun preparations. First, it decided that the Rural Work Department should summarize the experience of the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the past few years, and listen to the reports of comrades participating in the purchase work on the problems existing in the countryside, and then analyze and synthesize them, and write a draft resolution on the current rural work, which will be sent to various counties for widespread deliberation, and then the opinions will be collected and written into a resolution for discussion and adoption at the meeting. At the same time, from now on, mobilize Heilongjiang's newspapers and radio stations to vigorously organize publicity and reports on the new situations and new problems of the current mutual aid and cooperation movement, and can also organize discussions on some important issues, and mobilize rural work cadres and agricultural production cooperative directors to write letters introducing their experience in running cooperatives, etc. Through this method, we can arouse cadres at all levels to pay attention to the socialist transformation of the countryside, and seek ideological unity on some important issues, so as to create conditions for the success of the rural work conference.

    黑龙江省决定进一步推动农业合作化
    【本报讯】一九五五年的第一季度，中共黑龙江省委员会已确定把党的工作重点放在农业社会主义改造上。当前最主要的问题是进行新旧两条道路的教育。据一九五四年十一月底统计，全省农业生产合作社已有两万一千六百四十二个，入社的户数占全省农户总数的百分之三十四点六，较一年以前增加将近五倍。在全省百分之八十七点二的行政村里有了社，并出现了一千八百七十四个基本合作化村，六个基本合作化的县（即参加农业社的户数占百分之五十以上）。
    黑龙江省委认为：农业生产合作社的发展，除了个别地区外，基本上是正常的健康的，是合乎互助合作的发展规律的。但由于某些地区的建社工作不够细致，缺乏耐心的思想教育，一部分社员心情还不稳定，有些社组织工作还较混乱，没有组织冬季生产。有的地区虽然已经建立了社，但由于社的领导成分不纯，或者受到资本主义的影响而拒不接受国家计划，或者集体隐瞒产量，作投机买卖。黑龙江省委认为，上述问题必须迅速解决，一定要办好现有社，为全省农业合作化奠定基础。为此，省委决定在第一季度召开一个规模较大的农村工作会议，教育农村工作干部，必须明确认识在农业社会主义改造过程中，新旧两条道路的斗争是极其尖锐极其复杂的阶级斗争。必须根据党中央的方针、政策，掌握本省互助合作的发展规律，加强阶级政策的教育，加强党的领导，统一思想，统一步调，推动互助合作运动健康发展。为了开好这个会，黑龙江省委现已开始着手准备，首先决定由农村工作部总结过去几年来互助合作运动发展的经验，并听取参加征购工作同志汇报农村中存在的问题，然后加以综合分析，写成对当前农村工作的决议草案，发至各县普遍酝酿，再将意见集中写成决议，在会上讨论通过。同时，从现在起，动员黑龙江各报和广播电台，针对当前互助合作运动的新情况和新问题，大力组织宣传报道，并可组织一些重要问题的讨论，发动农村工作干部和农业生产合作社主任来信介绍自己的办社经验等等。通过这种方式引起各级干部重视农村的社会主义改造的工作，并在一些重要问题上，求得思想上的一致，为开好农村工作会议创造条件。
