The Ministry of Agriculture has decided to begin large-scale surveying of wasteland this year to prepare for large-scale land reclamation. This year, the plan is to survey 32.4 million mu of arable wasteland, and it is estimated that over 100 million mu of arable wasteland will be surveyed by 1957. The areas for wasteland surveying this year include Heilongjiang, Xinjiang, Guangdong, Guangxi, Gansu, Shandong, Jiangsu, Hebei, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, Yunnan, and Inner Mongolia. The Ministry of Agriculture has allocated special funds to the above areas and instructed them to actively prepare. It also requires that all areas not only complete the investigation and surveying of wasteland according to regulations, but also make specific plans. During the survey, a systematic understanding of the basic conditions of soil, water conservancy, and plant growth should be conducted. The surveyed wasteland must be large areas of land with flat terrain, concentrated area, fertile soil, and suitable for mechanized farming.

Currently, the Ministry of Agriculture is consulting with the Soviet land management expert group assisting our country in establishing the State-owned Friendship Farm to train personnel for surveying and planning wasteland in our country. It is also collecting relevant wasteland data from various provinces for research. Institutions specializing in managing the surveying and planning of wasteland will also be established in provinces with large wasteland surveying tasks.

    农业部计划三年内勘测荒地一亿亩
    农业部决定从今年开始大量勘测荒地，为大规模垦荒作准备工作。今年计划勘测可耕荒地三千二百四十万亩，到一九五七年预计要勘测一亿余亩的可耕荒地。今年勘测荒地的有黑龙江、新疆、广东、广西、甘肃、山东、江苏、河北、湖南、湖北、江西、安徽、云南和内蒙等地，农业部对以上各地已拨发专款，并指示各地积极进行准备；并要求各地不但要按规定完成荒地的调查和勘测工作，而且还要作出具体的规划。在勘测中应对土壤、水利、植物生长的基本情况进行系统的了解。勘测的荒地，必须是地势平坦，面积集中，土质肥沃，宜于机耕的大片土地。
    现农业部正商请帮助我国建立国营友谊农场的苏联土地整理专家小组，为我国训练勘测规划荒地的人员；并向各省搜集有关荒地的资料，进行研究。专门管理勘测规划荒地事宜的机构，亦将在勘测荒地任务大的省设立起来。
