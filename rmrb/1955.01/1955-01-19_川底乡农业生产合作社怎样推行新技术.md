How the Chuandi Township Agricultural Production Cooperative Promotes New Technologies
	Liu Jie

The Chuandi Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Pingshun County, led by Guo Yu'en, winner of the Patriotic丰产 Golden Star Medal, has widely promoted new agricultural technologies in recent years, resulting in year-on-year increases in agricultural output. In 1954, despite severe droughts followed by floods that seriously affected crop growth, the cooperative's 862 mu of land still achieved a high yield of 331 jin of grain per mu, 20 jin more than in 1953 and 115 jin more than pre-war production.

In recent years, this agricultural production cooperative has promoted many new agricultural science and technologies, and the cooperative members have recognized the importance of implementing new agricultural technologies through their own experiences. They often say: As long as we pay attention to technology, it's as if we've increased our land by several hundred mu.

How does Guo Yu'en lead the cooperative members in promoting new agricultural science and technologies?

The "Small Farm"

"No matter what you do, you must first set an example for the masses. When they see the facts, they will believe it. To get the masses to adopt new technologies, you must first set an example," Guo Yu'en said when talking about his experiences in promoting new technologies. In the spring of 1951, when the masses heard the government's call for increased production, they responded: The government calls for an increase of more than ten jin every year. How much can we increase in a hundred years? Can this be done? Guo Yu'en was determined to educate the masses with facts. He first experimented with technological reforms in corn cultivation on eight fen of land, and as a result, he created a high yield of 1,050 jin per mu. This broke the masses' and cooperative members' "production has reached its limit" mentality and initially established confidence in improving technology.

The cooperative allocated a small piece of land as an experimental plot, which everyone called the "small farm." They conducted variety comparison tests on the ten original varieties of millet in the village on the "small farm." The test results showed that the average yield of the four varieties, including "Hen's Beak," "White Willow Sand," and "One Red Strip," was 55% higher than the other six varieties. After evaluation and research by the old farmers, the best local variety was selected. After selecting the variety, the village's millet production has been stable for the past three years.

In the "small farm," Guo Yu'en also conducted experiments on single-stalk, double-stalk, and different numbers of stalks of corn. As a result, 1,800 to 2,000 stalks per mu yielded an average of more than 21% higher than other stalk numbers. Years of facts have proved that in this area, the yield of "Golden Queen" corn is reduced to varying degrees if the number of stalks per mu is lower or higher than this standard. Guo Yu'en often said: Any technological reform has its regional characteristics; without actual experiments and comparisons, it cannot be determined whether it can increase production in this area, and there is no persuasive power for farmers. The "small farm" is an effective way to solve this problem.

Technicians and Technical Committee

Improving the agricultural science knowledge of cooperative members is an important condition for implementing and promoting new technologies. Although the Chuandi Township Agricultural Production Cooperative is advanced, it often encounters resistance from conservative thinking when implementing major technological reforms. When promoting artificial pollination of corn in 1954, some cooperative members did not believe that it could increase production, thinking that it was "a waste of labor and useless" and "just finding work for the cooperative members." With the help of the scientific work team sent by the People's Government, Guo Yu'en explained the principles of cross-pollination and artificial pollination to the cooperative members, using the fact that many corn ears planted with soybeans or millet, which the villagers were most familiar with, had half or part of the ear that did not bear seeds. This cleared the masses' minds, and the entire cooperative carried out an auxiliary pollination of corn. Over the years, this cooperative has cultivated a group of farmer technicians who have a preliminary grasp of some new agricultural science and technology. The technicians have formed a technical committee to lead the entire cooperative. The task of the technical committee is to: propose specific methods for improving production before each farming season; regularly study the problems encountered in production, and learn advanced technologies; and use the method of "doing, teaching, and learning at the same time" to impart technology to each cooperative member. By adopting this organizational form, they have solved many problems in production over the years. In the spring of 1952, when there was a drought, the technical committee proposed changing the harrowing method from straight harrowing to cross harrowing. For thinning seedlings, it was proposed that corn should be thinned twice, leaving strong seedlings with flat roots and flat tops, which are easy to bear double ears; millet should be left with strong seedlings with round roots and pointed tops, which have large ears and high yields. It was also studied that the reason for the low yield of potatoes was that the seed potatoes were small with many buds, resulting in a cluster of seedlings with insufficient nutrition, so large potatoes with few buds should be used as seeds. Many improvement methods were also proposed for fertilization, cultivation, and seed selection.

Now, the cooperative has a total of 162 people who know how to apply medicine to the heart of corn leaves, 155 people who know how to soak and mix seeds, and 162 people who know how to artificially pollinate corn. This technical team is the basic force for the agricultural cooperative to carry out the technical innovation movement and ensure the comprehensive promotion of new agricultural technologies.

Combining Technological Improvement with Improved Management

In agricultural production cooperatives, the promotion of new technologies must be combined with improved management in order to achieve good results. Before the implementation of the "contract labor system" in the Chuandi Township Agricultural Production Cooperative, cooperative members could not implement many new technologies in order to earn more workdays. After the implementation of the "contract labor system," the time, quantity, and quality of completing cultivation were stipulated, which guaranteed the implementation of new technologies. For example, corn sowing must be completed between Grain Rain and Beginning of Summer, using the method of digging holes and planting seeds, with a row spacing of one chi and eight cun, and 1,800 seedlings per mu; corn weeding is divided into three times, the first time is when the seedlings are about four cun high, leaving seedlings evenly, the second time is completed when the seedlings are one chi and five to two chi high, removing all weeds; the third time is deep weeding and hilling, and the quality is thorough weeding and round hilling. Those who fail to complete on time and according to standards will be criticized and have work points deducted. Technical reform measures not included in the plan are guaranteed to be implemented by adopting temporary contract labor with additional points.

    川底乡农业生产合作社怎样推行新技术
    刘杰
    爱国丰产金星奖章获得者——郭玉恩领导的平顺县川底乡农业生产合作社，几年来广泛地推行了新的农业技术，农业产量年年提高。一九五四年，虽然先旱后涝，严重地影响了庄稼的生长，但全社八百六十二亩土地，仍然获得了每亩平均三百三十一斤粮食的高额产量，比一九五三年多二十斤，比战前产量高一百一十五斤。
    几年来，这个农业生产合作社推广了很多新的农业科学技术，社员们从切身的经验里认识了实行新的农业技术的重要性。他们常说：只要加工讲技术，咱们就等于增加了几百亩地。
    郭玉恩是怎样领导社员们推行新的农业科学技术的呢？
    “小农场”
    “不管做什么事，先给群众作出个样子，看见事实，人们就信了。让群众采用新技术，更得先作个样子出来。”郭玉恩在谈到他推广新技术的心得时这样说。一九五一年春天，群众听到政府号召增产时反映：政府年年号召增产十几斤，种上一百年，能增产多少啊！这能办到？郭玉恩决心要用事实教育群众，他先在八分地上试行种植玉米的技术改革，结果创造了一亩产一千零五十斤的高额产量，这才打破了群众和社员的“生产到顶”思想，初步树立了改进技术的信心。
    社里拨出了一小块地做试验地，大家管它叫“小农场”。他们把全村原有的十种谷种在“小农场”上做了品种对比试验。试验结果，其中“母鸡嘴”、“白柳沙”、“一条红”等四种谷子平均比其他六种增产百分之五十五；又经过老农民们的评比研究，选定了当地最好的品种。选择了品种以后，全村三年来的谷子产量一直是稳定的。
    在“小农场”里，郭玉恩还做了玉米单株、双株及不同株数的试验。结果，一千八百株到二千株的，比其他株数平均增产百分之二十一以上。几年的事实都证明，当地种“金皇后”玉米每亩株数凡是低于或超过这个标准的，都遭到不同程度的减产。郭玉恩常说：任何一项技术改革都有它的地区性；不经过实际试验对比，就不能肯定它在本地区能不能增产，对农民也就没有说服力量。“小农场”是解决这个问题的有效形式。
    技术员和技术委员会
    提高社员的农业科学知识，是实行新技术、推广新技术的重要条件。川底乡农业生产合作社虽然是先进的，但是在推行较大的技术改革时，也常遭到保守思想的抵抗。一九五四年推行玉米人工授粉时，有一部分社员不相信能提高产量，认为这样做“费工不顶事”，是“硬给社员找活干”。郭玉恩在人民政府派来的科学工作队的帮助下，用本村群众所最熟悉的豆子地或谷子地带种的玉米，有很多穗子是半面或半截不结籽的事实，给社员们讲解了异花授粉和实行人工授粉的道理，才打通了群众思想，全社玉米普遍进行了一次辅助授粉。几年来，这个社已经培养出一批初步掌握了一些新的农业科学技术的农民技术员；由技术员组成了领导全社的技术委员会。技术委员会的任务是：在每个农事季节到来之前，提出改进生产的具体办法；经常研究在生产中所遇到的问题，并学习先进技术；用“边做、边教、边学”的办法向每个社员传授技术。他们采用这种组织形式，几年来在生产中解决了好多问题。一九五二年春旱，技术委员会提出耙地时改顺耙为十字形耙。对间苗则提出玉米要采用两次间苗，留扁根平顶的壮苗，这种苗容易结双穗；谷子要留圆根、尖顶的壮苗，此种苗穗头大产量高。又研究了马铃薯产量低的原因是作种籽的薯块小芽眼多，出苗一堆，营养不足，应采用块大芽眼少的薯块做种籽。在施肥、中耕、选种上，也都提出了很多改进办法。
    现在这个社共有一百六十二人会玉米叶心灌药，一百五十五人会浸种拌种，一百六十二人会玉米人工辅助授粉。这支技术队伍，就是农业社开展技术革新运动，保证全面推行新的农业技术的基本力量。
    改进技术和改进经营管理结合
    在农业生产合作社推广新技术，一定要同改善经营管理结合起来，才能收到良好的效果。川底乡农业生产合作社在实行“包工制”以前，社员们为了多挣劳动日，许多新技术不能实行。实行“包工制”以后，把完成耕作的时间、数量和质量规定了下来，实行新技术就有了保证。如玉米播种要在谷雨、立夏间完成，用刨坑点种方法下种，株行距一尺八寸，每亩留苗一千八百株；玉米锄苗分三次，第一次在苗高四寸左右锄出，留苗要匀，第二次在苗高一尺五到二尺的时候完成，要去净杂草；第三次是深锄上堆，质量是锄透堆圆。凡是不能按时、按标准完成的，要受到批评，并且扣工分。没有订在计划之内的技术改革措施，采用临时包工加分的办法，保证实现。
