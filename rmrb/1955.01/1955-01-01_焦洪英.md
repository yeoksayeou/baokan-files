   “That’s Jiao Hongying.” Party Secretary Su Guoyou pointed to a woman who looked to be around forty years old, of medium height, thin, with large eyes and two braids, and introduced her to me. I saw patches of grayish-white scars on her hands and face, and I thought she must have just recovered from sores.
    Su Guoyou probably saw through my thoughts from the expression on my face, but he didn't directly tell me the origin of the scars on Jiao Hongying's body. Instead, he started abruptly, “Are you surprised? Comrade, don't look down on this female worker. She knows how to be a person and how to treat socialist construction. She works in the factory, doing whatever needs to be done, whether light or heavy, even what others don't want to do. She is not afraid of difficulties that others fear. She stays behind to continue working when others have left. She loves the factory and risks her life to protect it."
  “Our Guiyang Chemical Factory is a local industry with over two hundred workers, and most of the machines are old. Therefore, some people say, ‘What future is there in working in this factory!’
    “We had a technical worker in our factory who thought it was pointless to work here and that his abilities couldn’t be fully utilized. So, he grumbled, complained, and said, ‘I'm fed up with going around a few broken machines all day long.’ He couldn't sleep for several nights because he wanted to leave, and he didn't come to work for several days because his heart was already elsewhere. He wrote a letter to his older brother in Shanghai, asking him to find him a job. That’s one example. Some time ago, he wasn’t the only one with this kind of thinking. Even some of the cadres assigned to the factory thought that if you wanted to work in industry, you had to go to a big factory. But Jiao Hongying didn’t think that way. She completely believed in what the Party said. She said, ‘It is glorious to build the motherland anywhere. If other places are built well, we should learn from them. How can we abandon our work and just envy others' success?’ Comrade, do you want to know where Jiao Hongying’s scars came from? Let me tell you:
    “It happened on September 25, 1953.
    “Around 3:00 p.m., Jiao Hongying was standing next to the cotton gin driven by a motor, lowering her head to evenly feed the machine with refined cotton. Suddenly, with a bang, the machine caught fire due to friction and heat, and the cotton started to burn. She was the only one in the room at the time. It wouldn't have been a problem if there wasn’t much cotton in the machine, but the cotton on her body caught fire! She frantically tried to take off her work clothes, but she couldn't untie them, and she couldn't tear them off. She hurried to run towards the door, but there was a spread of refined cotton, white as snow, on the ground outside. The wind was very strong that day. If she ran out, the finished product workshop, the packaging workshop… would catch fire, explode, and the whole factory would be finished. This thought flashed through her mind, and she rushed towards another door. She remembered that there were two vats of water not far outside the door. Comrade, can you imagine that at a time like that, who wouldn’t want to run over and jump into the water vat? She took two steps forward and found that cotton was spread in front of the door and around the water vats. She stopped and squatted on the ground. At this moment, flames were shooting out from all over her body. Her hair and eyebrows were burned. She endured the pain, gritted her teeth, and rolled on the ground. A female worker who was drying cotton saw the fire on her body and ran over to beat it out, but she couldn't put it out. At this critical moment, a worker delivering boiled water came in and poured the boiling water on her body. The fire was extinguished, and Comrade Jiao Hongying fainted.”
    Comrade Su Guoyou took a sip of water, paused for a moment, and then said:
  “When she woke up after receiving an injection, she said one sentence: ‘Was the machine damaged? Were any comrades burned?’
    “Later, someone asked, ‘Why didn’t Jiao Hongying run outside when she was burned like that?’ Jiao Hongying replied, ‘Who likes to be burned? I’m forty years old. I herded cattle for landlords when I was thirteen, being beaten and scolded. Later, I was a beast of burden for capitalists. The capitalists fired me. Now the Party educates us and leads us in what we do. What I enjoy, I have personally experienced. What kind of person am I! How could I run away?’
    “After Jiao Hongying's incident, it spread among the workers in the factory. Some said, ‘Sister Zhang (Jiao Hongying's maiden name is Zhang, everyone calls her that to show their respect) is truly someone who is building socialism!’
    “Some said, ‘Jiao Hongying is a person, aren’t we people too? Some people look down on our factory. Does that mean that only big factories can build socialism, and our small factory can’t build socialism?’
      “Some people compare our construction cause to a net, with each thread connected to each other. Although we are an unknown small factory, when we produce more products to develop mines and build more roads and railways, how happy we should be standing on our mountain and looking into the distance!
    “The factory workers elected Jiao Hongying as a model worker, and recently she was also elected as a special-class model worker for the entire province. The workers said, ‘We elected her as a model worker because she made us understand how to build our factory.’
    “Now Jiao Hongying has become a glorious Communist Party member.”

    焦洪英

   “她就是焦洪英。”党委书记宿国有同志指着一个四十岁上下，中等身材，瘦瘦的，大眼睛，头上扎着两个辫子的妇女向我介绍。我看到她的手上和脸上的一片片灰白色的疤痕，我想她一定是刚生过疮的。
    宿国有同志大概从我脸上的表情看透了我的心思，但是他并没有直接了当地告诉我焦洪英身上疤痕的来由，却劈头说：“你感到很惊讶吗？同志别看轻了这个女工，她懂得怎样作人，怎样对待社会主义建设。她在厂里做活，不管轻的重的、别人不愿干的，她干。别人怕困难的，她不怕。别人下班走了，她留下继续干。她热爱工厂，拚上命保护工厂。”
  “我们这个贵阳化工厂，是地方工业，有二百多工人，机器大都是陈旧的。因此，有人就说：‘在这个工厂里干还有什么出息！’
    “我们厂里有个技术工人，认为在这个厂里工作没意思，能力施展不开，于是发牢骚、闹情绪，说：‘整天围着几部破机器转，真够了。’他为了想离开这里几夜睡不着觉，几天不上班，他的心已经飞到别处去了。他给他在上海的一个哥哥写了一封信：请求给他介绍职业。这是一个例子。前些时候有这种思想的人并不只他一个，就是分配到厂里的工作干部，有的也认为要搞工业就要到大厂去。可是焦洪英不这样，她完全听信党的话。她说：‘建设祖国在哪里都是光荣的。别处建设好了，我们应当学习他们。我们怎么能够放弃了自己的工作，光羡慕人家的好呢？’同志，你想要知道焦洪英身上的疤是那里来的吗？让我告诉你吧：
    “事情出在一九五三年九月二十五日那一天。
    “下午三点多钟的时候，焦洪英正在马达带动的弹花机旁边，低着头把精制过的棉花均匀地喂给机器，突然轰的一声，机器磨擦发热着了火，棉花燃烧起来了。那时屋里只有她一个人，机器上的棉花不多倒不碍事，可是火把她身上的棉花燃着了！她慌忙地解工作服，怎么也解不开，撕也撕不掉。她赶紧向门口跑去，外面地上摊着白花花的一片精制过的棉花，这天风刮的很大，如果跑出去，成品车间、包装车间……就会着火，爆炸，整个厂就完啦。这个念头在她的脑子里一转，她又朝着另外的一个门冲去，她想起在门外不远的地方有两缸水。同志，你想在这样的时候，谁不想一步跑过去跳在水缸里呢？她向前跑了两步，又发现门前和水缸周围都摊着棉花。她停下来，蹲在地上。这时，她身上各处吐着红红的火舌，头发、眉毛都被火烧了，她忍着痛，咬着牙，在地上打滚。一个晒棉花的女工看见她身上的火，跑过去给她打，打也打不熄，扑也扑不灭。在这十分危急的时候，一个送开水的工人走进来，把开水泼在她的身上，火熄灭了，焦洪英同志也昏过去了。”
    宿国有同志喝了一口水，沉默了一会，又说：
  “当她打过针醒来的时候，她说了一句话：‘机器烧坏了没有？同志们被火烧着了没有？’
    “后来有人问：‘焦洪英烧成那样子为什么不向外跑呢？’焦洪英回答说：‘谁喜欢挨火烧呢？我活了四十岁的人了，十三岁就给地主放牛，挨打受骂，后来给资本家当牛马，资本家开除我，现在党教育我们的，领导我们作的，我所享受的，我都亲身体验到了。我是什么人！我怎么能够往外跑呢？’
    “焦洪英这件事情发生以后，厂里的工人就传开了。有的说：‘张大姐（焦洪英娘家姓张，大家这样称呼表示对她的爱戴）才真是建设社会主义的人哪！’
    “有的说：‘焦洪英是人，我们不也是人？有人看不起我们的厂，难道说大厂才能建设社会主义，我们小厂就不能建设社会主义？’
      “有的人把我们的建设事业比作一片网，每根线都牵联在一起。我们虽然是个不出名的小厂，可是当我们出产了更多产品去开发矿山，修筑更多的公路和铁路的时候，我们站在我们这个山头上，望着远处该是多么高兴呵！
    “厂里工人选举焦洪英当了劳动模范，最近她又当选了全省的特等劳动模范。工人们说：‘我们选她当劳动模范是因为她使我们懂得了怎样来建设我们的工厂。’
    “现在焦洪英已成了光荣的共产党员。”
