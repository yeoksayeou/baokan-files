Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 14th: According to TASS, the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic held a meeting in Berlin on January 12th. The People's Chamber elected the Attorney General of the Republic, the Constitutional Committee, and the Legal Committee.

Subsequently, the representatives of the People's Chamber discussed the report of the delegation of the German Democratic Republic People's Chamber that attended the Prague Conference of parliamentary representatives from the Polish People's Republic, the Czechoslovak Republic, and the German Democratic Republic at the end of 1954.

Dieckmann, the head of the delegation of the German Democratic Republic People's Chamber, delivered a report on this matter. He described the process by which the Prague Conference reached its resolutions, pointing out the significant importance of this conference for expanding cooperation between the three neighboring democratic countries.

Dieckmann pointed out: The participants at the conference pointed out the serious dangers inherent in the Paris Accords. Dieckmann then said: The peaceful restoration of German unity is the main task at present. On the part of the German Democratic Republic, all measures should be taken to accomplish this task. Dieckmann then condemned the Western countries and the Adenauer government's policy of rearming West Germany, as well as Adenauer's nonsense about being able to use force to achieve German reunification after the Paris Accords were ratified. Dieckmann said: Only by abandoning the Paris military agreements, only through consultation, can German reunification be achieved.

Dieckmann pointed out: The trust of the friendly neighboring peoples in the peace forces of Germany inspires us to strive for peace and to fight against the revival of German militarism. The countries participating in the Prague Conference are fully determined to take all measures, once the Paris Accords are ratified, to safeguard their independence and peaceful labor, to safeguard the security of their borders and territorial integrity, and to protect the achievements of their working people.

During the discussion, representatives of all parties spoke. After the discussion, the meeting passed a resolution endorsing the position of the delegation of the German Democratic Republic People's Chamber at the Prague Conference, as well as the resolutions adopted by the Prague Conference.

    民主德国人民议院拥护布拉格会议的决议
    狄克曼指出德国人民决努力争取和平和反对巴黎协定
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：德意志民主共和国人民议院一月十二日在柏林举行会议。人民议院选举了共和国总检察长、宪法委员会和法律委员会。
    接着，人民议院的代表们讨论了出席一九五四年年底举行的波兰人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克共和国和德意志民主共和国三国议会代表布拉格会议的德意志民主共和国人民议院代表团的报告。
    德意志民主共和国人民议院代表团团长狄克曼就这一问题做了报告。他叙述了布拉格会议作出决议的经过，指出这个会议对扩大三个毗邻的民主国家之间的合作的重大意义。
    狄克曼指出：参加会议的人指出了巴黎协定所包藏的严重危险。狄克曼接着说：和平恢复德国的统一是当前的主要任务。在德意志民主共和国方面，应该采取一切办法来完成这一任务。狄克曼接着谴责了西方国家和阿登纳政府的重新武装西德的政策以及阿登纳的关于在批准巴黎协定之后就可以利用武力来达到德国的重新统一的胡说。狄克曼说：只有放弃巴黎军事协定，只有用协商的办法，才能达到德国的重新统一。
    狄克曼指出：友好的邻国人民对德国的和平力量的信任激励着我们努力为争取和平和反对复活德国军国主义而奋斗。参加布拉格会议的国家有充分决心，一旦巴黎协定得到批准，就采取一切措施，保障它们的独立和和平劳动，保障它们的边境安全和领土完整，保护它们的劳动人民所取得的成就。
    在讨论时，各党派的代表都发了言。讨论之后会议通过一项决议，拥护德意志民主共和国人民议院代表团在布拉格会议上的立场以及布拉格会议所通过的决议。
