Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 29th: TASS reports: Recently, there have been some news reports in Japanese and other countries' newspapers concerning the issue of Soviet-Japanese relations. Many newspapers have especially reported on the meetings between Soviet representatives in Tokyo and the Japanese Prime Minister. However, there are inaccuracies and distortions in these reports.

According to reliable sources, the head of the Soviet delegation in Tokyo, Mr. Domnitsky, visited Japanese Prime Minister Mr. Hatoyama on January 25 and held talks with him on the issue of Soviet-Japanese relations. During the talks, Mr. Domnitsky, on instructions from the Soviet government, made the following statement:

"As everyone knows, the Soviet Union, based on its desire to normalize relations with Japan, has consistently advocated adjusting relations with Japan. For example, the desire to normalize Soviet-Japanese relations has been demonstrated in the Joint Declaration of the Soviet Government and the Government of the People's Republic of China on October 12, 1954, and in the statement of the Soviet Foreign Minister V.M. Molotov on December 16, 1954.

As everyone knows, Japanese Prime Minister Hatoyama made remarks not long ago advocating the adjustment of Japanese-Soviet relations. The statement made by Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu on December 11, 1954, as well as his recent statement, also demonstrate a desire to normalize Japanese-Soviet relations.

The Soviet side has taken note of the above situation and believes that it is appropriate to exchange views on the possible steps for normalizing Soviet-Japanese relations.

The Soviet side is prepared to send representatives to conduct consultations, with the consultation venue being either Moscow or Tokyo, and wishes to know the Japanese side's opinion on this matter."

At the end of the conversation, Japanese Prime Minister Hatoyama told Mr. Domnitsky that the Japanese government would discuss this statement.

    苏联驻东京代表团团长多穆尼茨基
    奉苏联政府指示就苏日关系问题发表声明
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十九日讯：最近，在日本以及其他国家的报纸上，出现了一些关于苏日关系问题的消息。有许多报纸特别报道了苏联代表在东京和日本首相会见的消息。但是，这些消息里面有不确切和歪曲的地方。
    根据可靠的消息，苏联驻东京代表团团长多穆尼茨基一月二十五日访晤了日本首相鸠山先生，并且和他就苏日关系的问题进行了会谈。在会谈时，多穆尼茨基奉苏联政府的指示发表声明如下：
    “大家知道，苏联本着使对日本的关系正常化的愿望，始终不渝地主张调整对日本的关系。例如，在苏联政府和中华人民共和国政府一九五四年十月十二日的联合宣言中以及在苏联外交部长维·米·莫洛托夫一九五四年十二月十六日的声明中，都表现出要使苏日关系趋向正常化的愿望。
    大家知道，日本首相鸠山先生在不久以前发表的言论中，曾主张调整日苏关系。而在日本外务相重光葵先生一九五四年十二月十一日发表的声明中以及在他最近的声明中，也表现出要使日苏关系正常化的愿望。
    苏联方面注意到了以上的情况，并且认为就苏日关系正常化的可能步骤的问题交换意见是适当的。
    苏联方面准备委派代表进行商谈，商谈地点在莫斯科或是在东京都可以，并且希望知道日本方面对这个问题的意见。”
    在谈话结束时，日本首相鸠山先生对多穆尼茨基说，日本政府将讨论这个声明。
