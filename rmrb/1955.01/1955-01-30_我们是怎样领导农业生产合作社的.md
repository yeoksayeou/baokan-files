How We Lead Agricultural Production Cooperatives
Luo Zhanchao, Secretary of the CPC Quhui Township Branch, Zhaohua, Sichuan

I believe that to lead agricultural production cooperatives well, one must first rectify one's understanding of them. Previously, I had several misconceptions about agricultural production cooperatives: one was that "leading agricultural production cooperatives is a matter for the county and district committees and the work cadres. Our branch is only responsible for leading mutual aid teams"; another was that leading agricultural production cooperatives was "troublesome," fearing that "once you get in, you can't get out"; especially after hearing that agricultural production cooperatives were "only allowed to succeed, not fail," I became even more afraid, fearing that if I got involved and didn't do well, I would be punished. Because of these misconceptions, in 1953, when I saw that the Jialing Agricultural Production Cooperative in our township had many problems, I didn't raise them in the branch meetings for study and resolution, which resulted in members withdrawing from the Jialing Cooperative even after a bumper harvest that year, and the cooperative director, Wang Dengzhi (a member of the party branch committee), was unwilling to lead the cooperative anymore, wanting to revert to a mutual aid team.

In December of that year, the county committee convened a meeting of key personnel for running cooperatives. At the meeting, I heard the county committee secretary report on the nature and purpose of agricultural production cooperatives, the principles, policies, and methods for running them, and also heard about the favorable conditions and major difficulties in running cooperatives. The county committee secretary emphasized that the branch must strengthen its leadership over agricultural production cooperatives and list leading agricultural production cooperatives as the branch's regular central task, especially emphasizing that the branch secretary should go deep down to personally lead agricultural production cooperatives; at the same time, he also criticized the erroneous thinking of some party members who were not actively enthusiastic about leading agricultural production cooperatives. I was shocked to hear this! I thought to myself that this must be talking about me. After seven days of study and discussion at the meeting, the county committee organized us to study the experience of branch leadership of agricultural production cooperatives introduced in the Sichuan Daily. The county committee also had an individual talk with me, asking us to work hard to study the party's policies and the experiences of other places, strengthen the collective leadership of the branch committee, and strengthen the leadership of agricultural production cooperatives, saying: "As long as you have the determination, there is nothing that cannot be done." At the same time, he instructed us to be humble in our work, to ask comrades about things we didn't understand, and to ask the higher authorities for instructions. He also said to me: "Leading agricultural production cooperatives is a glorious task assigned to you by the party, and I believe you are determined to complete this task." This meeting strengthened my confidence and determination to lead agricultural production cooperatives. After returning to the township, I not only frequently studied policies and knowledge about running cooperatives, but also became concerned about the problems of the Jialing Agricultural Production Cooperative in our township, and always raised the problems to the branch committee or general membership meeting for study and discussion, and I myself was willing to go to the agricultural cooperative to understand the situation and help the cooperative cadres solve some problems.

By January of last year, under the leadership of the district committee, our township expanded the Jialing Cooperative and established two new agricultural production cooperatives, Tianxiong and Jinxing. With more cooperatives, I felt a heavy burden and was afraid of not doing well; also, because my working methods were not correct, I was busy every day but still couldn't find the "key." Seeing this situation, the district committee comrades instructed me: "To run agricultural production cooperatives well, you must give full play to the strength of all the branch committee members and party members." They also said: "You yourself must go deep into one cooperative, explore experience, discover problems, and guide the overall situation." Afterwards, I followed the instructions of the district committee comrades and convened a branch committee meeting. First of all, I explained to everyone the importance of strengthening the party's leadership over agricultural production cooperatives, and rectified everyone's understanding. Then, we decided to establish party groups in the three cooperatives, and the branch committee members were assigned to lead each cooperative: the branch committee member in each agricultural production cooperative was responsible for leading that cooperative, and the branch committee member who had not yet joined the cooperative would lead a mutual aid team in a village. In order to strengthen unified leadership, it was also decided to hold a branch committee meeting every ten days to collectively study some major issues. In this way, I also went deep into the Jialing Cooperative to assist Wang Dengzhi's leadership.

After I arrived at the Jialing Cooperative, I found that the party members in the cooperative were selfish and did not care about the collective interests of the cooperative. The deputy director, Li Bingxiang (a party member), did not participate in pond digging in the cooperative, but went to earn cash; he also took the cooperative's powder residue to feed his own pigs. The members were very dissatisfied, and the members did not listen to him when he allocated labor. There were three party members in one team, and after digging the pond, they did not collect their baskets. The director, Wang Dengzhi, felt that he had been running the cooperative for more than a year, and that the cooperative had expanded to fifty households, so he became complacent. Then I went to understand the situation of the Tianxiong and Jinxing cooperatives, and there were also some problems. The deputy director of the Tianxiong Cooperative, He Taosheng (a party member), only cared about grabbing points for himself and did not care about the members' work. Member Liu Bingmo reflected: "Speaking of party members not being selfish and taking care of the overall situation, I think this party member only cares about himself and not the members." The deputy director of the Jinxing Cooperative, Liang Xinghai (a party member), was arguing for points for his wife in the cooperative. The members gave the woman seven points (reasonable), but he wanted to give her seven and a half points. When he didn't get his way, he was unwilling to lead the cooperative and wanted to work on the railway, which aroused dissatisfaction among the members. These problems were all at once in front of me, and I was very anxious, not knowing how to solve them. A few days later, Comrade Liu Tianfu from the county committee came, and I told him about these situations. He said: "To solve the problems, you only need to strengthen the education of party members, and if you get the thinking of the party members straight, things will be easy to handle." I thought this was right, party members are the guides for the peasants, how the party members walk, so do the members. Afterwards, I first convened a branch committee meeting. Before the meeting, I planned in my mind to first organize everyone to exchange experiences in leading the cooperatives at the meeting, and then talk about the thinking and performance of the party members. Wang Jinyou (director of the Tianxiong Cooperative) and Yang Wanxiu (director of the Jinxing Cooperative) both talked about some experiences and also raised many problems, but when it came to Wang Dengzhi, he didn't talk about anything, just chatted casually. At this time, I took the initiative to talk. I first affirmed the achievements of the Jialing Cooperative, and also reviewed my own lack of leadership over the cooperative, and then I talked about the problems I learned about in the Jialing Cooperative one by one. When talking, I focused on criticizing Wang Dengzhi's complacency. Other branch committee members also raised opinions about Wang Dengzhi. Finally, Wang Dengzhi also made a review. The meeting also summarized the problems of the several cooperatives and studied some solutions. This was a great help and education for everyone. Everyone reflected afterwards: "The meeting was held in a timely manner and solved the problems very well."

After the branch committee meeting, a general membership meeting of party members was convened. At the meeting, Yang Wanxiu and Wang Jinyou were commended for their selfless and exemplary behavior in caring for the cooperative; some party members were criticized for only caring about themselves and not the collective interests, and Li Bingxiang's erroneous behavior was specifically criticized by name. Everyone also raised many opinions to Li Bingxiang, and he also made a review himself. Finally, it was decided that "party members should take practical actions to care for the collective interests of the cooperative, do a good job in the cooperative's production and work, and lead all members to run the cooperative well." After the meeting, I had an individual talk with Li Bingxiang, and also helped him analyze his mistakes at the party group meeting, and asked him to make a public review in his team. This not only educated the party members and the members, but also changed the members' perception of the party members. Member Zhang Huazhi said: "As long as he makes a good review, we won't blame him."

The party members' ideological awareness has been raised, their enthusiasm is very high, and they generally care more about the cooperative than before, and they all want to run their own cooperative well. However, the Tianxiong and Jinxing cooperatives are newly built and lack experience in management and operation. For example, at the beginning of the spring production last year, they couldn't implement piece-rate work and still implemented fixed scores and flexible evaluation, which had a great impact on the members' labor enthusiasm. Some members were unwilling to go out to work, and no one would cultivate the bad fields. Members of the Tianxiong Cooperative reflected: "If we want to work hard, we need a cadre to follow us and score us." According to this situation, a branch committee meeting was convened in a timely manner. At the meeting, Wang Dengzhi and I introduced the method and benefits of implementing piece-rate work in the Jialing Cooperative. Yang Wanxiu and Wang Jinyou were very happy to hear it, and they were determined to try it out. But when Yang Wanxiu went back and conveyed it in the cooperative, some members thought it was "troublesome" and "difficult to do." Yang Wanxiu personally used a field of one dan of rice to do an experimental demonstration, and the members were very satisfied after seeing it. The piece-rate work method was promoted in the Tianxiong and Jinxing cooperatives, which greatly stimulated the members' labor enthusiasm.

As a result, these two cooperatives were busy with the management and operation of the cooperative and neglected the political education of the members. At the beginning of the spring production, many members did not obey the transfer. Members He Jisheng and Zhang Zhiming of the Tianxiong Cooperative also clamored to withdraw from the cooperative; some members of the Jinxing Cooperative went out to do carpentry work, and some members were unwilling to put fertilizer into the cooperative, and some were unwilling to accumulate fertilizer. After understanding the situation, I reported the situation to the district committee and asked for instructions. Immediately, a branch committee meeting was convened and studied. Everyone unanimously believed that this was mainly due to insufficient political and ideological education for the members. In addition to introducing the political and ideological education work of the Jialing Cooperative at the meeting, it was decided to strengthen the party's leadership over the cooperative affairs committees of each cooperative and carry out work through the cooperative affairs committees. It was also decided to strengthen the leadership of the Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation, and the propaganda network, and the party members were assigned to lead them: branch youth committee member Yang Wanxiu led the Communist Youth League; branch women's committee member Jia Kaizhen led the women's masses, branch secretary Zhang Kaigui led the propaganda network; and I was responsible for leading the administrative cadres and grasping the overall situation. Group branches and propaganda member groups were also established in the cooperative one after another.

From then on, every time the branch made a resolution on a matter, it was communicated and implemented through cadre meetings, CYL member meetings, propagandist meetings, and women's meetings, and these organizations were frequently used to carry out propaganda and education for the members. In order to strengthen the training and education of CYL members and activists, outstanding CYL members were appropriately absorbed to listen to the party lessons every time, and activists were also absorbed to participate in listening to the CYL lessons to improve their socialist awareness. The party groups in the cooperative held meetings to study and deploy work, and sometimes also absorbed the CYL branch secretary, branch committee members, and good cooperative cadres to participate, so that they clearly understood the party's leadership intentions, and then mobilized and educated the youth and cooperative members through them to implement and realize the party's resolutions. In this way, the party's political and ideological work in the cooperative was greatly strengthened, and the members who originally wanted to withdraw from the cooperative also stabilized.

On the content and methods of propaganda and education for the members, the branch committee proposed to everyone: "To educate the members, we can't just talk empty theories, but we must carry out through production and handling specific problems." According to the working situation of each period, the branch also gave instructions at any time. When the cooperatives were formulating the spring production plan last year, some members wanted to grow more flue-cured tobacco to earn money. The branch committee conducted timely research and pointed out that each cooperative must obey the state plan and produce according to the plan, "grow more grain and cotton, and less flue-cured tobacco," and instructed each cooperative to universally and deeply carry out vivid and specific patriotism and worker-peasant alliance education for the members, and educate the members to increase the production of grain and cotton to support the country's socialist industrialization. After each cooperative did so according to the instructions of the branch committee, it greatly increased the members' patriotic enthusiasm. The cotton fields of all three cooperatives were more than doubled compared with 1953. In June of last year, it was dry, and many members in the three cooperatives were ideologically shaken, thinking that the drought would not increase production and the harvest would not be enough to eat. After learning about this situation, the branch successively convened branch committee meetings and meetings of cooperative directors of each cooperative, conducted detailed research, and decided to mobilize and organize members to vigorously carry out drought resistance, implement rational water use in the fields, hoe and sun the water seedlings, and put forward the slogan of "dry fields and dry ponds"; irrigate the land with thin manure water, and put forward the slogan of "save one seedling and increase production by one seedling." Drought resistance work was immediately vigorously carried out in the cooperative and was very effective. After the end of the drought resistance, each cooperative summarized the achievements of the drought resistance, further demonstrated the superiority of the agricultural production cooperative's unified management and unified allocation of labor, and further specifically carried out collectivist education for the members, which greatly improved the members' thinking. Originally, 15 or 16 households out of 50 in the Jialing Cooperative were ideologically shaken; 12 households out of 37 in the Tianxiong Cooperative were ideologically shaken. After the drought resistance work, most of the members solved their ideological problems and strengthened their confidence.

The branch also decided that each cooperative should periodically summarize production, and the cooperative affairs committee should report work to the members at the general membership meeting, carry out criticism, and commend members and cooperative cadres who worked well, cared for public property, and obeyed the state plan. Yang Shili, a member of the Jinxing Cooperative, plowed the sandy fields without harrowing, and could not retain water. As a result, not only was he deducted three points, but he was also criticized for his mistake of not caring about the collective interests. The former deputy director Yang Shian, member Rao Yousheng, and four others got up in the middle of the night to block water, cared for the collective interests, and enabled the cooperative to plant more dry seedlings. The cooperative affairs committee commended them and set an example for the members. The members said: "They are our good examples, and we must learn from them." Afterwards, there were more and more members in the cooperative who cared for the collective interests. Each cooperative also used the live facts of using "666" powder, sulfuric acid subchemical fertilizer, new-style walking plow, and visiting the Baocheng Railway to educate the members, so that the members more clearly recognized the great significance of supporting the country's socialist industrialization and strengthening the worker-peasant alliance from practical examples. During the autumn harvest distribution last year, each cooperative did full political and ideological work before and during the distribution. By summarizing the reasons for increased production and grasping the increased production examples of typical members for comparative education, the members more deeply realized the superiority of the agricultural production cooperative and more deeply realized that only by taking the road of collectivization is the bright and happy road, and taking the capitalist road of individual prosperity is the road of poverty and suffering.

Before last autumn, four more agricultural production cooperatives were established in our township. As soon as the new cooperatives were established, the directors felt that they had few leadership methods. When encountering problems in the cooperatives, some new cooperative directors ran to the township to find me, asking me to come up with solutions for them, and also requested to select other directors. I raised this issue for study at the branch committee meeting. According to the instructions of the county committee, it was finally decided to adopt the method of old cooperatives leading new cooperatives. Of the seven branch committee members, three were directors of old cooperatives, and the rest were directors and cooperative cadres of new cooperatives. It was decided to divide the seven agricultural cooperatives into three fulcrums, with three old cooperatives leading one to two new cooperatives each. Because the new cooperatives had few party members and could not establish party groups, and also based on the distance of the terrain, a party group was established in the Fenghuang and Xinhe cooperatives, and the Qinghe and Nonglin cooperatives were merged with the Tianxiong and Jinxing old cooperatives respectively to establish party groups. This greatly strengthened the connection between the old and new cooperatives. At the same time, according to the instructions of the county committee, a joint meeting system for cooperative directors was established, and meetings were held regularly. Before the meeting, I notified the cooperative affairs committees of each cooperative of the issues to be studied and resolved at the meeting, and at the meeting, according to the problems existing in the new cooperatives, the old cooperatives introduced their original methods and experiences in solving such problems. After doing this, many specific problems of the new cooperatives were solved. Sometimes, experienced members and cooperative cadres from the old cooperatives were also introduced to the new cooperatives to assist in solving some problems. At first, the new cooperatives could not figure out how to evaluate work and score points, allocate labor, and arrange work, so four people, including Li Bingxiang of the Jialing Cooperative, were sent to assist in solving these problems. The members of the new cooperatives were very satisfied and asked them to go more often.

To make the agricultural production cooperatives continue to be consolidated and developed, the party must often pay attention to educating party members to do a good job in leading and driving the work of mutual aid teams, and lay a good foundation for the establishment and expansion of agricultural production cooperatives. After January of last year, there were three cooperatives in the township. At that time, the branch decided that each cooperative should lead four to five mutual aid teams according to the conditions, and sometimes the mutual aid team leaders were also absorbed to participate in the cooperative meetings. The branch also regularly convened joint meetings of mutual aid team leaders to help them formulate production plans. The cooperative cadres divided the work to specifically help the mutual aid teams solve problems. In this way, the mutual aid teams were influenced and driven from all aspects. The four new cooperatives established before autumn and the three old cooperatives that were expanded were all established and expanded under such leadership and cultivation. Although there are currently seven agricultural production cooperatives in the township, and the number of households participating in the cooperatives has reached 62.7% of the total number of households in the township, this is still a long way from the party's requirement that we guide the vast number of peasants to the goal of socialism, and there are still more than 30% of the households that have not joined the cooperatives. Even among the households that have joined the cooperatives, many people's thinking is not firm, so we must not be complacent. Our branch has also decided that all seven cooperatives must do a good job in leading the surrounding mutual aid teams and individual farmers, and party members who have not yet joined the cooperatives should specifically lead a mutual aid team or joint team, actively create conditions, and strive to establish and participate in agricultural production cooperatives. The branch has also decided to often pay attention to cultivating party building targets and developing party members in the mutual aid teams, and cultivate backbones for running agricultural production cooperatives.

    我们是怎样领导农业生产合作社的
    中共四川昭化曲回乡支部书记  罗占超
    我觉得要领导好农业生产合作社，首先就要端正自己对农业生产合作社的认识。原先我对农业生产合作社有几种错误认识：一种是认为“领导办农业生产合作社是县委、区委和工作干部的事情。我们支部只是领导搞互助组”；另一种是认为领导农业生产合作社“麻烦”，怕“钻进去不能脱手”；特别是听说办农业生产合作社“只许办好，不许办坏”，我更加怕起来了，怕钻进去办不好，要受处分。因为有这些错误认识，所以在一九五三年时，我看到乡里嘉陵农业生产合作社有许多问题，也没有在支部的会议上提出来研究解决，以致嘉陵社在当年大春丰收后，仍有社员退社，社长王登芝（党支委）也不愿领导社了，想仍改为互助组。
    这年十二月，县委召开办社骨干会议。我在会上听到县委书记报告了农业生产合作社的性质、目的，办社的原则、方针、政策和作法，并听到讲了办社的有利条件和主要困难。县委书记强调指出支部必须加强对农业生产合作社的领导，要把领导农业生产合作社列为支部的经常中心任务，特别强调支部书记要深入下去亲自领导农业生产合作社；同时还批判了有些党员不积极热心领导农业生产合作社的错误思想。我听了大吃一惊！心想这一定是在说我。经过七天会议的学习和讨论，会后县委又组织我们学习了四川日报上介绍的支部领导农业生产合作社的经验。县委又找我作了个别谈话，要我们努力学习党的政策和别地方的经验，加强支部委员会的集体领导，加强农业生产合作社的领导，说：
  “只要有决心，没有办不成的事。”同时指示我们在工作中要虚心，不懂的就问同志，就向上面请示。又对我说：“领导农业生产合作社，是党交给你们的光荣任务，相信你们一定有决心完成这项任务。”这次会议坚定了我领导农业生产合作社的信心和决心。回乡后不但经常学习办社方面的政策和知识，对乡里嘉陵农业生产合作社的问题也关心起来，随时把问题提到支部委员会或党员大会上研究讨论，我自己也肯去农业社了解情况，帮助社干部解决一些问题。
    到去年一月份，我们乡在区委领导下，扩建了嘉陵社，又新建了天雄、金星两个农业生产合作社。社多了，我感到担子很重，生怕办不好；又由于工作方法不对头，天天忙的不得了，还是摸不到
  “门路”。区委同志看到这种情况，就指示我说：
  “要办好农业生产合作社，就必须发挥全体支部委员和党员的力量。”还说：“你自己还必须深入一个社，摸索经验，发现问题，指导全面。” 过后我照着区委同志的指示，召开了支部委员会。首先向大家讲明了加强党对农业生产合作社领导的重要意义，端正了大家的认识。然后研究决定在三个社内建立党小组，支部委员又实行了分工：在哪个农业生产合作社的支委就负责领导哪个社，暂时还没入社的支委就领导一个村的互助组。为了加强统一领导，又决定十天开一次支部委员会，集体研究一些重大问题。这样，我也就深入到嘉陵社去协助王登芝的领导了。
    我到嘉陵社后，发现社里的党员自私、不关心社的集体利益。副社长李炳祥（党员）不参加社内挑塘，去挣现钱用；他还拿社里的粉渣去喂自己的猪。社员很不满意，他去调配劳动力，社员也不听。一队有三个党员，挑完塘，撮箕也不收捡。而社长王登芝认为自己已办了一年多社了，而且社又扩大到五十户，自满起来。接着我又把天雄，金星两个社的情况一了解，也存在一些问题。天雄社副社长何桃生（党员），光顾自己抢分，不管社员的活路。社员刘炳模反映：“说起党员不自私，顾全面，我看他这个党员还是光顾自己，不顾社员。”金星社副社长梁兴海（党员）在社内为他老婆争分，社员给这妇女评七分（合理的），他要评七分半，没有评上去，他就不愿领导社了，想到铁路上做工，引起社员不满。这些问题一下子摆在面前，我心里很着急，不知怎样解决。过了几天，县委会刘天福同志来了，我就把这些情况告诉他。他说：
  “要解决吗，只有加强党员的教育，把党员的思想打通了，事情就好办了。”我想这话是对的呀，党员是农民的引路人，党员怎样走，社员也就怎样走。过后首先召开了支部委员会。会前我心里计划了一下，在会上就先组织大家互相交流领导社的经验，接着又谈了党员的思想和表现。王金友（天雄社社长）杨万秀（金星社社长）都谈出了一些经验，也摆出了很多问题，但是轮到王登芝，就没有谈出啥来，只是随便扯了一下。这时我就主动的谈起来：我首先肯定了嘉陵社的成绩，也检讨了自己对社领导得不够，然后就把我在嘉陵社了解的问题，一一谈出来了。谈的时候，着重批判了王登芝的自满情绪。其他的支部委员也对王登芝提出了意见。最后王登芝也作了检讨。会上还把几个社的问题归纳起来，研究了一些解决的办法。这样对大家都是一次很大的帮助和教育。大家过后都反映：“会开的及时，很解决问题。”
    支部委员会开过后，接着又召开了党员大会。会上首先表扬了杨万秀、王金友在社内的大公无私，关心社的模范行为；批判了一些党员只顾自己不顾集体利益，又指名批判了李炳祥的错误行为。大家又对李炳祥提了很多意见，他自己也作了检讨。最后决定“党员要以实际行动关心社的集体利益，搞好社内的生产和工作，带动全体社员办好社。”会后我又和李炳祥作了个别谈话，又在党的小组会上，帮助他分析他的错误，叫他在本小队作了公开检讨。这样不但教育了党员，教育了社员，同时也改变了社员对党员的看法。社员张华芝说：“只要他检讨的好，我们也不怪他。”
    党员的思想觉悟提高了，情绪很高，一般对社比以前关心了，都想把自己的社办好。但是天雄、金星两社都是新建的，在经营管理方面还缺少经验，如去年大春生产开始时，他们就搞不来按件计工，还实行的死分活评，对社员的劳动积极性有很大影响，有的社员不愿出去干活，不好耕的田没人耕。天雄社的社员反映：“要想我们展劲干活，就要来个社干跟上给我们评分。”根据这一情况及时召开了支部委员会，会上我和王登芝把嘉陵社实行按件计工的办法和好处作了介绍，杨万秀、王金友听了很高兴，他们都决心回去试用。但杨万秀回去在社里一传达，有些社员认为“麻烦”、“不好搞”。杨万秀就亲自用了一石谷子的田作了实验示范，社员看后很满意。按件计工的办法在天雄、金星两社内推行开了，大大发挥了社员劳动积极性。
    这样一来，这两个社又忙于搞社内的经营管理，对社员的政治教育却忽视了。大春生产开始，许多社员不服从调动，天雄社的社员出去解木头，社员何继生，张芝明也吵着要退社；金星社有的社员出去做木活，还有些社员不愿把肥料投入社，有的也不愿意积肥。经了解后，把情况回报给区委，作了请示。随即召开了支部委员会，进行了研究，大家一致认为这主要是对社员的政治思想教育不够。会上除了把嘉陵社的政治思想教育工作作了介绍外，决定要加强党对各社社务委员会的领导，通过社务委员会进行工作。还决定加强对青年团、妇联、宣传网的领导，党内分工由专人领导：支部青年委员杨万秀领导青年团；支部妇女委员贾开珍领导妇女群众，支部书记张开贵领导宣传网；我就负责领导行政干部和掌握全面。又在社内先后建立了团分支，宣传员小组。
    从这以后，支部每次对一件事情作出决议后，就分别通过干部会，团员会，宣传员会，妇女会进行传达贯彻，并经常发挥这些组织的作用，向社员进行宣传教育。为了加强青年团员和积极分子的培养教育，每次上党课，都适当吸收优秀团员来听课，上团课也吸收了积极分子参加听课，提高他们的社会主义觉悟。社内党小组开会学习和布置工作，有时也吸收团支部书记、支部委员和好的社干部参加，使他们明确了解党的领导意图，再通过他们去动员和教育青年和社员群众，贯彻实现党的决议。这样使党在社里的政治思想工作大大加强了，原来那些想退社的社员也稳定下来了。
    在对社员的宣传教育内容和方法上，支部委员会向大家提出：“向社员进行教育，不能光讲空道理，要通过生产和处理具体问题来进行。”根据各个时期工作的情况，支部又随时作了指示。去年社内订大春生产计划时，有的社员想多种土烟赚钱，支部委员会及时进行了研究，指出各社必须服从国家计划，按计划生产，“多种粮棉，少种土烟”，并指示各社要普遍深入对社员进行生动具体的爱国主义和工农联盟教育，教育社员增产粮棉支援国家社会主义工业化。各社按照支部委员会指示做后，大大提高了社员的爱国热情。三个社都比一九五三年扩大了棉田一倍多。去年六月间，天干，三个社里许多社员思想动摇，认为天干增不了产，收的不够吃。支部了解到这一情况后，接连召开了支部委员会和各社社长会议，进行了详细研究，决定动员和组织社员大力展开抗旱，田里实行合理用水，薅晒水秧，提出“田干堰塘干”的口号；地里用稀粪水过灌，提出“救活一苗，增产一苗”的口号。抗旱工作马上在社内大力展开了，收效很大。在抗旱结束后，各社都总结了抗旱的成绩，进一步显示了农业生产合作社统一经营，统一调配劳力的优越性，进一步具体地向社员进行了集体主义教育，大大提高了社员的思想。原来嘉陵社五十户中有十五、六户思想动摇；天雄社三十七户中有十二户思想动摇，经过抗旱工作，绝大部分社员都解决了思想问题，增强了信心。
    支部还决定：各社按期总结生产，由社务委员会在社员大会上向社员报告工作，开展批评，表扬劳动好，爱护公共财物和服从国家计划的社员和社干。金星社社员杨世礼，沙田不耙就犁，关不住水，结果不但扣了他三分，并批判了他不关心集体利益的错误。原副社长杨世安，社员饶友生等四人，半夜起来堵水，关心集体利益，使社内多栽了旱秧，社务委员会对他们进行了表扬，在社员中树立了榜样。社员们说：“他们是我们的好榜样，我们要向他们学习。”过后社内关心集体利益的社员也就愈来愈多了。各社还通过使用“六六六”药粉、硫酸亚化学肥料、新式步犁、参观宝成铁路等活的事实向社员进行教育，使社员从实际事例中更加认识到支援国家社会主义工业化，加强工农联盟的重大意义。去年秋收分配中，各社在分配前和分配中，都作了充分的政治思想工作。通过总结增产原因，抓住典型社员的增产事例进行对比教育，使社员更加体会到农业生产合作社的优越性，更加体会到只有走合作化的道路，才是光明幸福的道路，走个人发财的资本主义道路是贫穷痛苦的道路。
    去年秋前我们乡里又建立了四个农业生产合作社。新社一建立起来，社长都感到领导办法少。有的新社社长在社里碰到问题，就跑到乡上来找我，叫我给他想办法，还要求另外选社长。支部委员会上我就把这个问题提出来研究，根据县委指示，最后决定采取老社带新社的办法。支部委员会七个支委，有三个是老社的社长，其余是新社的社长和社干部，决定以三个老社为中心，把七个农业合作社分为三个支点，每个老社带一个到两个新社。新社的党员少没法建立党小组，又依据地形远近，在凤凰、新合两社建立一个党小组，清河、农林两个新社分别与天雄、金星两个老社合并建立党小组。这样大大加强了老社与新社的联系。同时又根据县委指示，建立社长联席会议制度，定期开会。开会前，我就把会上要研究解决的问题，通知各社务委员会准备，在会上根据新社存在的问题，由老社介绍他们原来解决这类问题的作法和经验。这样作过后，解决了新社很多具体问题。有时还把老社中有经验的社员和社干部介绍到新社去协助解决一些问题。新社最初搞不来评工计分、调配劳力、安排活路，就把嘉陵社的李炳祥等四人派去协助解决。新社社员很满意，要求他们多去。
    要使农业生产合作社不断得到巩固和发展，经常在党内还要注意教育党员作好领导和带动互助组的工作，为建立和扩建农业生产合作社打好基础。去年一月份以后，全乡有三个社了。当时支部决定每个社根据条件带动四个到五个互助组，社内开会有时也吸收互助组长参加。支部又定期召开互助组长联席会，帮助他们订立生产计划。社干分工具体帮助互助组解决问题。这样从各方面去影响和带动互助组。秋前建立的四个新社和扩建的三个老社都是在这样的带动和培养下建立和扩建起来的。目前全乡虽有七个农业生产合作社，参加社的农户已达全乡总农户的百分之六十二点七；但这和党要求我们要把广大的农民引导到社会主义的目标还有很长的距离，还有百分之三十几的农户还没有入社，就是入了社的农户中也还有许多人思想不坚定，因此我们决不能自满。我们支部又决定七个社都必须作好带动周围的互助组和单干农民的工作，暂时还未入社的党员都具体领导好一个互助组或联组，积极创造条件，争取建立和参加农业生产合作社。支部还决定经常注意在互助组中培养建党对象和发展党员的工作，给办农业生产合作社培养骨干。（杨知人记）
