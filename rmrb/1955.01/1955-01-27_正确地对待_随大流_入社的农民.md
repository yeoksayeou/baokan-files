    Correctly Treat Peasants Who Joined the Cooperative "By Following the Crowd"
    Hua Lin
    Correctly understanding and treating peasants who joined the cooperative "by following the crowd" is an important aspect of consolidating agricultural production cooperatives at present.

    According to a survey of twenty-six cooperatives in Hebei Province, the members who joined "by following the crowd" roughly account for half of the members. (In cooperatives with more thorough ideological mobilization, there are fewer such members; conversely, there are more.) According to surveys in other regions, these members account for about 40 percent of the total membership. Looking at the composition of these people, the majority are old middle peasants who own more means of production.

    When consolidating agricultural production cooperatives, special attention should be paid to these members who joined "by following the crowd." The issue of how to treat these members is essentially the issue of how to correctly treat middle peasants in the cooperativization movement.

    These members who joined "by following the crowd" are all working peasants. Their private ownership mentality is relatively strong, but there is no irreconcilable contradiction between the interests of cooperativization and their fundamental interests. Therefore, it can be said with certainty that if the cooperative is well-managed, guaranteeing increased production and income, and strengthening political education, these members can be consolidated. At present, production should be organized quickly; ideological education should be strengthened when discussing the cooperative's charter; and in terms of the ratio of dividends for labor and land, and the handling of the means of production, the principles of benefiting production and not disadvantaging poor peasants should be adhered to, and the interests of middle peasants should be earnestly taken care of. In this way, most of the members who joined "by following the crowd" will be able to stay in the cooperative and actively participate in production; some of those who joined reluctantly may also become basically voluntary.

    After earnestly completing the above work, if some people still want to withdraw from the cooperative, this should be allowed. Forcing them to stay in the cooperative, constantly causing trouble, is detrimental to both the cooperative and themselves. However, when they withdraw from the cooperative, they must be made to feel the warmth of the cooperative, advised to produce well after leaving the cooperative; and told that the cooperative still welcomes them whenever they want to join. Under no circumstances should they be treated differently, ridiculed or sneered at because they have withdrawn from the cooperative.

    Peasants who joined "by following the crowd" have various different thoughts. A deep understanding and correct analysis of these thoughts is an important basis for us to carry out the work of consolidating the cooperative. Therefore, all localities should seriously investigate and study the specific thoughts of peasants joining the cooperative and carry out work in response to the masses' thoughts. If it is simply assumed that those who joined "by following the crowd" are completely voluntary, and no patient and meticulous work is carried out, the consolidation of the cooperative will be difficult. If it is simply assumed that those who joined "by following the crowd" are not truly voluntary, and no detailed work is carried out, but a dismissive approach is adopted, that is also wrong.

    正确地对待“随大流”入社的农民
    华林
    正确地认识和对待“随大流”入社的农民，是当前巩固农业生产合作社的重要环节。
    根据对河北省二十六个社所作的调查，“随大流”入社的社员大体上占社员的半数。（在思想发动比较充分的社，这种社员比较少些；反之，就比较多些。）另据其他地区的调查，这种社员约占社员总数的百分之四十。从这些人的成份看，占有生产资料较多的老中农居多数。
    在进行农业生产合作社的巩固工作时，对待这些“随大流”入社的社员应当特别注意。对待这些社员的问题，实质上也就是在合作化运动中如何正确地对待中农的问题。
    这些“随大流”入社的社员都是劳动农民。他们的私有观念比较浓厚，可是合作化的利益和他们的根本利益之间并没有不可解决的矛盾。因此，可以肯定地说，如果把社办好，保证增加生产和增加收入，并且加强政治教育工作，这些社员是可以巩固下来的。目前，应该迅速把生产组织好；在讨论社章的时候加强思想教育工作；在劳力和土地的分红比例、生产资料的处理等方面，坚持有利生产和不使贫农吃亏的原则，并切实地照顾中农的利益。这样，“随大流”入社的社员大部分就能留在社里，积极参加生产；勉强入社的一部分人，也可能变成基本上自愿的。
    认真地进行了以上的工作以后，如果有些人还愿意退社，这是应该允许的。如果把他们勉强留在社里，经常闹情绪，对社、对他们自己都是不利的。但是，在他们退社时，一定要使他们体会到社的温暖，劝他们出社以后好好生产；并且告诉他们：什么时候愿意入社，社仍然欢迎他们。决不可因为他们退社了，就对他们另眼相看，冷讽热嘲。
    “随大流”入社的农民具有各种不同的思想，对这些思想的深入了解和正确分析，是我们进行巩固社的工作的重要依据。因此，各地应当认真调查研究农民入社的具体思想，针对群众的思想进行工作。如果笼统认为“随大流”的就是完全自愿的，而不去耐心细致地进行工作，社的巩固是有困难的。如果笼统地认为“随大流”的都不是真正自愿的，不进行细致的工作，而采取一推了之的办法，也是不对的。
