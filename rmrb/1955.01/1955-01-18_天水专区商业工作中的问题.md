The Tianshui Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party conducted an inspection of the work of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce in the third quarter of last year. The results showed that there were serious problems in the commercial work of the Tianshui Special District, especially in the supply of materials, which were prominently reflected in the following two aspects:

On the one hand, the implementation of national plans by state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce was very poor. In the third quarter, except for the sales plan of the Salt Affairs Bureau and the procurement tasks of the cooperatives, which were overfulfilled, the trade companies, cotton yarn and cloth companies, department stores, animal products companies, and pharmaceutical companies all failed to complete their purchase and sales plans. The sales plan of the supply and marketing cooperatives under the supply and marketing cooperative offices was only 86.81% completed; the sales plan of the monopoly company was only 97% completed; the sales plan of the coal and construction company was only 84.26% completed; the plan implementation of the food company was the worst, only completing 56.9% of the procurement plan and 45.7% of the transfer plan. Looking at the main commodities, the procurement plans were not completed for medicinal materials, casings, pigs, sheep, and fur; the sales plans were not completed for cotton, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, sugar, kerosene, cigarettes, and other production and living materials.

On the other hand, supply and marketing work was chaotic and passive. According to the statistics of four companies including the department store, there were more than 370 kinds of goods out of stock, large and small. Many commodities, especially some daily necessities, could not meet the minimum requirements of consumers, and even a few commodities could not be distributed to consumers in a timely and reasonable manner. For example, edible oil has not been seriously supplied to the countryside, and the supply standards for Tianshui City have been lowered. In terms of meat, only 5,086 of the 21,000 head of fat pigs transferred to the higher level were completed, and the average daily slaughter of pigs in Tianshui City for 50,000 people was only 14 head (about 1,000 catties). The cotton yarn and cloth companies in various counties have few sources of goods and few varieties. The cloth sales department of the Tongwei County Chengguan Cooperative only has a dozen rolls of red cloth. All these directly affected the production and life of the masses of all classes, and caused great damage to the Party's political influence.

This situation is, of course, due to the contradiction between the production and sales of some commodities, and there is a certain distance between the quantity we can supply and the ever-increasing needs of the masses; at the same time, there was excessive rainfall this year, mountain floods, repeated collapses of the Baotian Road, and many highways in the territory were also washed out by floods, and transportation was once interrupted, which caused great difficulties for the transfer of materials and urban-rural exchanges. Although the railway has now been repaired, and forces have been organized from all aspects to transport goods, the backlog of materials is too large to be transported at once. However, these are not the main reasons. The main reasons are: the leadership ideology of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce cannot keep up with the development of the objective situation, bureaucracy is serious in the supply work, there is a lack of a high sense of responsibility for the people's livelihood, a lack of clear policy views and mass viewpoints, and insufficient confidence in overcoming difficulties, and even some wrong practices have been generated. The Tianshui Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is responsible for not checking and correcting this serious situation in a timely manner, but the main reason is that the institutions and responsible personnel at all levels in charge of this work have adopted an extremely unserious attitude towards the Party's policies. Specifically, it is reflected in the following aspects:

One, with the planned supply of some commodities, supply exceeding demand has become an excuse for bureaucrats. Commodities that could have been adequately supplied are not promoted to supply the market's needs. For example, the supply of firewood and charcoal in Tianshui City is very tight, while the Coal and Construction Company has more than 10 million catties of broken coal in storage, but does not dare to promote it to the masses. The reason is that "the higher-level company has instructed that the national supply is in short supply and should not be promoted." Furthermore, some commodities in the department store sales department have been out of stock for a long time, but a lot of inventory was found during warehouse inspections.

Two, simply complain about objective difficulties. When there are difficulties, they do not actively try to overcome them, but adopt a passive attitude of dragging on for one day and only supplying when there is something, and out of stock when there is nothing. When the train was interrupted, in addition to the small amount of materials transported by car, they sat and waited, neither actively raising opinions to the higher level to solve the problem, nor actively organizing the masses to transport goods. Internal allocation was also not timely, resulting in accumulation in one place and out of stock in another. There are also many units that, when some famous brands or fast-selling commodities are in short supply, do not know how to promote stockpiled commodities and organize local sources of goods.

Three, they did not seriously study and implement the Party's instructions and resolutions, but instead created their own set, and even adopted wrong methods. Tongwei County closed all private oil mills for fear of affecting the rapeseed procurement. The food company did not solve the difficulties and problems in the procurement of live pigs, but simply waited for procurement, and arbitrarily stipulated that live pigs weighing less than 100 catties would not be accepted, and no feed was supplied, which caused many difficulties for the procurement work of the supply and marketing cooperatives. As a result, large pigs could not be procured, and those weighing less than 100 catties were not dared to be procured. The losses caused by weight loss, death, and injury due to being returned again and again because they did not meet the standards of the food company were significant.

Four, the business departments did not adequately estimate the market situation, were very blind, and lacked foresight. Many sales units usually do not pay attention to reasonable inventory. Once a transportation problem occurs, it leads to artificial out-of-stock situations. For example, the Xinglong and Zaojiao supply and marketing stations in Tianshui County adopted a buy-as-you-go approach and did not maintain a fixed inventory. As a result, there was panic due to the temporary unavailability of salt, which was abundant in the region, due to traffic congestion, and limited supplies had to be implemented. In addition, state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperative commerce cannot cooperate well and support each other. For example, there are two prices for the purchase of wool. Some cooperatives sell the wool they purchase on the spot without going through the animal products company or caring whether it meets the specifications. State-owned companies are also not concerned enough about the technical specifications guidance and problem-solving of the commodities sold on behalf of the supply and marketing cooperatives, which is also one of the reasons for the failure to complete the plan.

Finally, the Commercial Department and individual business units do not have enough understanding of the situation below, and do not have enough control over the source of goods, especially do not pay enough attention to how serious the problems will be if some important materials cannot be supplied as much as possible within the possible range. For example, cotton, tea, and coal are neither allocated in one go, nor are they informed of the source of goods. Some are allocated today, and some are allocated tomorrow. Sometimes they are required to control sales below, and then, after the following arrangements are made according to this spirit, they are required to overcome conservative thinking and supply freely, which creates many difficulties for the work of the units below.

The Tianshui Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has taken the necessary measures to reverse the above situation and will continue to conduct inspections to help discover and solve the existing problems in all aspects.

    天水专区商业工作中的问题
    中国共产党天水地方委员会
    中国共产党天水地方委员会去年曾对国营商业和合作社商业第三季度的工作进行了一次检查，结果说明天水专区商业工作尤其是物资供应工作存在严重的问题，突出地表现在以下两个方面：
    一方面是国营商业和合作社商业对国家计划的执行情况非常不好，第三季度除盐务局的销售计划和合作社的收购任务超额完成以外，其余如贸易公司、花纱布公司、百货公司、畜产公司、医药公司都没有完成购、销计划；供销合作社办事处所属各供销合作社销售计划只完成百分之八十六点八一；专卖公司销售计划只完成百分之九七；煤建公司销售计划只完成百分之八十四点二六；食品公司的计划执行情况最差，仅完成收购计划的百分之五十六点九，完成调出计划的百分之四十五点七。从主要商品看，收购方面没有完成计划的有药材、肠衣、猪、羊、皮毛；销售方面没有完成的是棉花、棉纱、棉布、糖、煤油、纸烟及其他多种生产和生活资料。
    另一方面，供销工作紊乱被动。据百货公司等四个公司的统计，脱销的商品大大小小达三百七十种以上，许多商品特别是若干生活必需品不能满足消费者的最低要求，有的甚至连很少的一些商品也不能及时而合理地分配到消费者手里。如对农村的食油一直没有认真供应，对天水市则降低上级标准供应。肉食方面，上调肥猪二万一千口只完成五千零八十六口，天水市五万人每天宰猪平均只有十四口（约千余斤）。各县花纱布公司货源不多，品种也少，通渭县城关合作社布匹门市部仅有十几匹红布。所有这些，直接影响到各阶层群众的生产和生活，使党的政治影响受到了极大的损失。
    这种情况，固然是若干商品产、销有矛盾，我们能够供应的数量和群众日益增长的需求有一定的距离；同时今年雨水过多，山洪成灾，宝天路接连塌方，境内公路也多被水冲坏，交通运输曾经中断，给物资调运和城乡交流工作造成了很大的困难。现在铁路虽已修复，并从各方面组织力量运送，终因物资积压过多不能一下赶运。但这些不是主要的原因，主要的原因是：国营商业和合作社商业的领导思想的预见赶不上客观形势的发展，供应工作中，官僚主义严重，对人民生活缺乏高度的责任心，缺乏明确的政策观点和群众观点，对克服困难的信心不足，甚至还产生了若干错误作法。对于这种严重情况，中国共产党天水地方委员会没有及时检查纠正，是有责任的，但主要的是各级主管此项工作的机构及主管工作人员对党的政策采取极不严肃的态度。具体表现在以下几个方面：
    一、随着部分商品的计划供应，供不应求成为官僚主义者的借口，本来是可以充足供应的商品也不设法推销供应市场需要，如天水市柴炭供应情况十分紧张，而煤建公司存放碎煤达一千多万斤，不敢向群众宣传，理由据说是“上级公司有指示，全国供不应求，不宜推销”。再如百货公司门市部有些商品脱销了很长时间，但从仓库检查出存货很多。
    二、单纯埋怨客观困难，有了困难不去积极设法克服，而是采取拖一天算一天，有就供应，没有只好脱销的消极态度。当火车中断后除汽车运了少许物资外，就坐守等待，既不向上级积极提意见解决问题，也不积极组织群众运输力量，境内调拨也不及时，以致形成甲地积压乙地脱销。还有许多单位，当部分名牌货或者畅销的商品供应不足时，不知道推销积压的商品和组织当地货源。
    三、没有认真研究贯彻党的指示决议，而是自搞一套，甚至采取了错误的办法。通渭县因怕影响油籽收购，竟将私营油坊全部封闭。食品公司不解决收购毛猪中的困难和问题，只是坐等收购，而且擅自规定不够百斤的毛猪不收，不供给饲料，给供销合作社收购工作造成很多困难，结果大的收不到，百斤以下的不敢收，已收到的也由于因不符合食品公司的标准退来退去，掉膘、死伤造成的损失很大。
    四、业务部门对市场情况估计不足，盲目性很大，缺乏预见。许多销售单位，平时不注意合理库存，一旦运输发生问题即酿成人为的脱销，如天水县兴隆、皂郊两供销站采取边购边进方式，没有按定额库存，于是有一度本区充足掌握的食盐因交通阻塞一时调运不到发生恐慌，只得实行限额供应。此外，国营商业和供销合作社商业不能很好配合、相互支持，如收购羊毛挂两个价格，有的合作社把收购的羊毛不通过畜产公司也不管是否合乎规格就地自营，国营公司对供销合作社代销商品的技术规格指导及困难的解决同样也不够关心，这也是完不成计划的原因之一。
    最后，商业厅和个别业务单位对下面情况了解不够，货源情况掌握不够，特别是对一些重要的物资如不能在可能范围内尽量供应，将会造成多么严重的问题重视不够。如棉花、茶叶、煤炭既不统一一次拨给，又不告诉货源情况，今天拨一些，明天拨一些，有时要求下面控制推销，等到下面按照这个精神布置后，又要下面克服保守思想，放手供应，给下面单位的工作造成许多困难。
    中国共产党天水地方委员会为了扭转上述情况，已采取了必要的措施。并继续进行检查，帮助发现解决各方面存在的问题。
