He said that in carrying out this task, we are faced with a world full of dangers. Only a united and strong Asia—not through force but through the power of its unity, especially in economic unity—can carry out such an arduous task.

    Prime Minister U Nu of Burma said that he came to Bogor to strive to find ways to achieve world peace. He said that in seeking solutions, we have become close friends, and we hope that when Asian and African countries meet in a few months, they will become even closer friends.

    Prime Minister Kotelawala of Ceylon said that Asian countries should show the world that they are now independent and can strive for their own progress. He said, "We will do this through joint cooperation."

    Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo of Indonesia said that the Asian-African Conference would be held in a few months. Asian and African countries will show the world that they are no longer prepared to be looked down upon.

    President Sukarno spoke at the meeting. He welcomed the holding of the Asian-African Conference and believed that this conference would unite Asia, which was divided by colonialism in the past.

    During the rally, the "People's Committee to Support the Asian-African Conference," composed of more than 50 Indonesian political parties and groups, presented the "Declaration of the Indonesian People" to the Prime Ministers. The declaration stated, "The Indonesian people sincerely hope to live in harmony with the people of all countries in the world, especially with the people of Asian and African countries." The declaration said, we sincerely hope that Asian and African countries will be invited to participate in the conference to work together to completely resolve the issue of national independence for the people of Asian and African countries, establish genuine peace, and expand economic and cultural ties for the common good.

   【新华社雅加达三十一日电】雅加达市民三十日上午在伊卡达广场举行大会，庆祝南亚五国总理茂物会议圆满结束。
    参加大会的群众有十万人。他们举着很多的标语牌，上面写着：“消除殖民主义，发展和平合作”，“亚非国家的光荣在于和平合作”，“茂物会议和万隆亚非会议的目标是加强亚非国家，创立世界和平”。
