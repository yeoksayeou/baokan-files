    Preliminary Experiences of Agricultural Production Cooperatives in Running Winter Schools and People's Schools
    Yu Bo, Tong Li

    In order to adapt to the development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement and the needs of production, and to systematically improve the political consciousness and cultural level of agricultural production cooperative members, many agricultural production cooperatives in various regions are currently running winter schools and people's schools, and have achieved some success. According to statistics from seven counties including Xin County, Gaomi, and Linqu in Shandong: among 1,370 agricultural production cooperatives, 765 cooperatives have established people's schools, accounting for 55.8% of the total number of existing agricultural production cooperatives. In Yanji County, Jilin, 321 out of 758 agricultural production cooperatives are directly managing cultural learning. The winter schools and people's schools of agricultural production cooperatives in various regions have organized cultural learning according to the needs of their members, and have conducted political and ideological education in conjunction with central tasks, which has improved the cultural level and ideological awareness of the members, and has played a certain role in promoting production and central tasks. For example, in the Changsheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhaozhou County, Heilongjiang, 23 out of 44 illiterate people have become literate after one year of study. Members of the Hongxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Sui County, Henan, said: "Learning some characters makes us feel enlightened. Now that we have learned the characters on the work tickets, we can see how many points we have, and we won't be confused anymore!" The deputy director of the cooperative used to be illiterate. When recording the harvest, he drew pictures to record things – he drew a wheat stalk for wheat accounts, and flower stalks or bean stalks for cotton and bean accounts. Now that he has learned some common characters, he happily said: "This year, harvesting crops won't be difficult anymore!" Members of the Yang Hong'e Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburban area of ​​Dalian City learned about crop rotation methods in the people's school. By planting according to this method, crop yields increased by 38%. Members of the Banshankou Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qixia County, Shandong, learned new peanut planting techniques in the people's school, which increased peanut production from 250 jin to 350 jin per mu.

    Experience in various regions proves that agricultural production cooperatives have many advantages in running schools: First, since production and learning are managed uniformly within the cooperative, it is easy to resolve the contradiction between learning and production time. Second, due to the consistency of production and learning time within the cooperative, it is easy to attract cadres, party members, league members, and more young and middle-aged people to participate in learning. Third, because members produce and learn together, it is easy to carry out self-study and mutual teaching, and improve learning effectiveness. Fourth, it is easy to solve problems such as teachers, funding, and learning locations. In addition, it can meet the needs of the agricultural production cooperative itself, and organically combine political, cultural, and technical education to better serve agricultural production.

    According to experience in various regions, agricultural production cooperatives should pay attention to the following issues when running schools:

    First, agricultural production cooperatives must have certain conditions to run schools. Generally, the foundation of the cooperative should be relatively solid, and production should be on track. For example, "four fixes" (fixed quotas, fixed output, fixed labor, fixed time) should be implemented within the cooperative, there should be annual and short-term production plans, and various necessary systems should be established. At the same time, the ideology of the members should be relatively stable. Experience shows that people's schools established under the above conditions can persist in learning and achieve good results. For example, some agricultural production cooperatives in Qixia County, Shandong, were established in January 1954. In March, after the production and other conditions matured, they started people's schools. The students' enthusiasm for learning was high, with an average attendance rate of over 80%, and they have persisted for nearly a year. On the contrary, opening classes blindly without considering the conditions will not allow them to persist in learning and will not be welcomed by the masses. For example, as soon as the Xiaobeiwang Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yongnian County, Hebei, was established, literacy workers subjectively proposed methods for running schools and organizing learning. The masses said: "The problems in the cooperative have not yet been solved, who has the mind to study?" As a result, it failed.

    Second, agricultural production cooperatives should adopt various methods according to the specific conditions. There are roughly three methods: one is to run schools independently within the cooperative, one is to run schools jointly by two or more cooperatives, and the other is to run schools based on agricultural production cooperatives and absorb the masses outside the cooperative to participate in learning. Generally, cooperatives with more households or a better learning foundation can run schools independently, organize classes according to cultural level, and organize decentralized learning by production teams (groups). Sometimes, classes can be organized according to the production and work conditions of different objects, such as men's classes (groups), women's classes (groups), and cadre classes (groups). As for small cooperatives with few students, if it is difficult to run schools independently, joint school operation can be adopted. If there are fewer masses outside the cooperative, schools can be run on the basis of the cooperative, absorbing non-members to participate in learning. For example, in Sanbaishu Village, Wu'an County, Hebei, there are twelve medium and small agricultural production cooperatives. One medium cooperative runs a school independently, and eleven small cooperatives run schools jointly by several cooperatives. Since there are fewer masses outside the cooperative in Liuqu Village, schools are run on the basis of the cooperative, absorbing non-members to participate in learning. Among the above three methods, it is generally better for agricultural production cooperatives to run schools independently and on the basis of the cooperative. It is easy to unify leadership and arrange learning time when agricultural production cooperatives run schools independently, and teaching can be carried out in combination with the needs of the cooperative. However, some cooperatives have insufficient teachers, uneven cultural levels, too many classes, and difficulties in teaching. Running schools on the basis of the cooperative and absorbing non-members to participate in learning is beneficial to strengthening the connection between agricultural production cooperatives and the masses outside the cooperative, but it is often difficult to unify time. Joint school operation by several cooperatives often has many difficulties in learning management and time unification due to different production organizations, and attention should be paid to establishing a unified leadership organization and strengthening cooperation between cooperatives to avoid the "three-no-care" phenomenon. These methods can be adopted flexibly according to the specific conditions of each region.

    Third, the focus of education in agricultural production cooperative schools should be flexibly grasped according to the development of the agricultural production cooperative and the situation of production and central tasks. If the cooperative has been established recently, political and ideological education should be emphasized to establish the collectivist ideology of the members, and then gradually increase the proportion of cultural courses to meet the cultural needs of the members in production and life according to the development of production in the cooperative. In the early days of the Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Cang County, Hebei, the members still had thoughts such as "joining the cooperative to try it out" and "fear of losing money by investing in the cooperative." The leaders of the cooperative first organized a political class with 72 members participating. The general task of the country during the transition period, the experience of running cooperatives, and the central task were the contents of education, which helped the members establish the idea that "the cooperative is home," and then gradually increased cultural courses. In addition to using the compiled textbooks, the cultural courses should also appropriately supplement some content according to the needs of production. For example, the students of the Qin Zhenwu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiaobeiwang Village, Wudian District, Yongnian County, Hebei, asked to understand how to record work tickets, so they were asked to learn to write Arabic numerals and learn some commonly used terms in production, such as "hoeing," "weeding," and "accumulating fertilizer," etc. Technical education should be carried out with the change of production seasons. For example, when planting crops, the Xigou Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Pingshun County, Shanxi, asked a village cadre to talk about "poisonous grain" (referring to mixing seeds with medicine to prevent pests). The students followed what the cadre said and planted 340 jin of "poisonous grain" on 210 mu of autumn land, and the seedlings emerged very well. In addition, there should be a special person in charge of cultural, political, and technical education in the cooperative. For example, in the Xu Xiaorong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Longyang District, Xindeng County, Zhejiang, in addition to asking a people's school teacher to teach cultural courses, the director of the cooperative, Xu Xiaorong, was responsible for political education, and the secretary of the League branch, Yu Liting, was responsible for technical education.

    Fourth, attention should be paid to the selection, training, and care of teachers. Generally, it is appropriate to select teachers from within the cooperative. When necessary, teachers can also be hired from outside the cooperative. According to experience in various regions, cooperatives need more teachers to run schools. In addition to the teachers that should be equipped for each class, when conditions permit, several counselors can be equipped to facilitate tutoring in class to consolidate the knowledge learned by the students and to facilitate tutoring for students' decentralized review. The people's school of the Zhao Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xingping County, Shaanxi, set up fourteen counselors to assist in teaching, and the effect was very good. If teachers delay production due to teaching, the cooperative should provide as much care as possible. The Xigou Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Pingshun County, Shanxi, adopted the method of "exchanging work." The cooperative annually gave the teachers 40 working days (paid from the public welfare fund) to compensate for the lost work of the part-time teachers. In addition, the leaders of the cooperative should always care about the training and improvement of teachers, and encourage their teaching enthusiasm from a spiritual and social status perspective.

    Fifth, agricultural production cooperatives must have sound leadership to run schools. First of all, the leaders of the cooperative should pay enough attention to running schools, regard it as a part of their regular work, and actively lead, support, and supervise it. Secondly, there should be a unified organization. Some regions have set up a school affairs committee under the production management committee, composed of cooperative affairs committee members, teachers, student representatives, etc., and designated the main cadres of the cooperative as the principals of the people's schools. If the agricultural production cooperatives run schools jointly, representatives are selected from each cooperative to jointly form the school headquarters or study committee. However, no matter what form it takes, it must work under the unified leadership of the CCP township and village branches and the township government. After the people's school of the Xigou Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Pingshun County, Shanxi, was led by the cooperative, the cooperative's overall plan also formulated a plan for the work of the people's school and put forward various requirements. All the main cadres of the cooperative did "two managements," that is, managing production and also managing learning, and regularly held meetings to check the implementation of the work plan of the people's school. Again, because there is a certain unified leadership, it is possible to uniformly arrange the time for learning, production, and meetings to maintain the regularity of learning. The time arrangement of the Xigou Village Cooperative in Pingshun County is: the cooperative affairs committee meets on the 10th of every month, the cooperative members' representative meeting or the agricultural technology research meeting meets on the 5th of every month, political education is conducted within the cooperative on the 2nd and 8th of every month, and 4 more flexible meeting times are reserved. If there are no meetings, the members are organized to listen to the radio, and the rest is cultural learning time. When the cooperative affairs committee and the cooperative members' representative meeting are held, the remaining members still take cultural classes, and those who miss classes are given make-up lessons, so that they can take twenty cultural classes every month. The Xu Xiaorong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Longyang District, Xindeng County, Zhejiang, adopted the method of evaluating work in the fields of each production team and recording points and arranging work after dinner (before 7:00 pm), which unified the time for evaluating work and recording points with the time for class, ensuring two hours of learning every night, which does not hinder production and work, but also meets the learning requirements of the members.

    At present, agricultural production cooperatives have achieved success in running schools. However, since this is a new work and lacks mature experience, or because of the lack of specific leadership for the cooperatives that have already been established, the quality of school operation by the general cooperatives is not high enough, and some are not stable enough. Therefore, all regions should strengthen leadership over school operation by agricultural production cooperatives and actively and systematically carry out this work. Business departments should pay attention to cultivating and summarizing experience, promoting experience, and improving the quality of school operation by cooperatives. The key to doing this work well lies in actively relying on the party committee, striving for the cooperation of relevant departments, and gaining the active support of the masses, so that farmers' spare-time cultural education can better serve the socialist transformation of agriculture.

    农业生产合作社举办冬学、民校的初步经验
    余博  佟力
    为适应农村互助合作运动的发展和生产的需要，有计划地提高农业生产合作社社员的政治觉悟程度和文化水平，目前不少地区的农业生产合作社举办了冬学、民校，并有了一些成绩。据山东莘县、高密、临朐等七县统计：在一千三百七十个农业生产合作社中，已有七百六十五个社办了民校，占现有农业生产合作社总数的百分之五十五点八；吉林延吉县七百五十八个农业生产合作社有三百二十一个社已直接管理文化学习。各地农业生产合作社的冬学、民校，根据社员的需要组织了文化学习，并结合中心工作进行了政治思想教育，提高了社员的文化水平和思想觉悟程度，对生产和中心工作起了一定的推动作用。如黑龙江肇州县长胜农业生产合作社的四十四名文盲，经一年学习，已有二十三名脱离文盲状态。河南睢县红星农业生产合作社的社员说：学些字心里就亮堂了，像我们学会了工票上的字，也看出是多少分，再不坐闷车啦！该社副社长原来不识字，在收获记账时，画图记事——记麦账画个麦穗，记棉花账和豆子账，就画花棵或豆棵。现在他学了一些常用字，高兴地说：
  “今年收庄稼，就不作难啦！”旅大市郊区杨洪莪农业生产合作社社员，在民校学了轮作方法，按照这个方法播种，作物产量提高了百分之三十八。山东栖霞县班山口农业生产合作社社员在民校中学习了种花生的新技术，提高了花生产量，每亩从二百五十斤提高到三百五十斤。
    各地经验证明，农业生产合作社办学是有许多优越条件的：一、由于社内统一管理生产和学习，便于解决学习和生产时间的矛盾；二、由于社内生产学习时间的一致，便于吸收干部、党员、团员和较多的青年和壮年参加学习；三、由于社员共同生产、共同学习，便于开展自学互教，提高学习效果；四、便于解决师资、经费和学习地点等问题；另外，可以适应农业生产合作社本身的需要，使政治、文化、技术教育有机地结合起来，更好地为农业生产服务。
    据各地经验，农业生产合作社办学，一般应注意以下几个问题：
    第一、农业生产合作社办学，必须具有一定的条件。一般是社的基础要比较巩固，生产走上了轨道。比如社内进行了“四定”（定量、定产、定工、定时），有全年和小段的生产计划，建立了各种必要的制度等。同时，社员思想要比较安定。经验证明：凡是按照以上的条件办起来的民校，就能坚持学习，而且效果较好。如山东栖霞县有些农业生产合作社，一九五四年一月建立，至三月间，生产等各项条件成熟后，就举办民校，学员学习情绪较高，平均到课率达百分之八十以上，迄今坚持近一年之久。相反的，不顾条件，盲目开班，就不能坚持学习，而且不为群众所欢迎。如河北永年县小北旺村农业生产合作社刚一成立，扫除文盲工作人员就主观地提出办校办法，组织学习。群众说：社里的问题还解决不了，谁有心学习。结果失败了。
    第二、农业生产合作社办学，应根据具体条件，采取各种不同的办法。大体上有三种办法：一种是社内单独办学，一种是两个以上的社联合办学，另一种是以农业生产合作社为基础，吸收社外群众参加学习。一般是户数较多或学习基础较好的社可以单独办学，按文化程度编班上课，按生产队（组）分散学习，有时可按不同对象的生产工作情况分别编班分组，如男子班（组）、妇女班（组）、干部班（组）等。至于小社，学员不多，如果单独办学有困难，即可采取联合办学的办法。如果社外群众较少时，可以以社为基础，吸收社外群众共同办学。如河北武安县三柏树村有中、小农业生产合作社十二个，其中一个中社单独办学，十一个小社都是几个社联合办学；六渠村社外群众较少，就以社为基础办学，吸收非社员参加学习。上述三种办法，一般以农业生产合作社单独办学和以社为基础办学较好。农业生产合作社单独办学便于统一领导，统一安排学习时间，并能结合社内需要进行教学，但有的社因师资不足，文化程度不齐，编班过多，教学上有困难；以社为基础办学，吸收非社员参加学习，对加强农业生产合作社同社外群众的联系有好处，但往往时间难于统一；而几个社联合办学，由于生产组织不一，在学习管理和时间统一上有不少困难，应注意建立统一领导的组织，加强社同社之间的协作，避免“三不管”的现象。这些办法，可根据各地具体情况，灵活采用。
    第三、农业生产合作社办学的教育重点，应根据农业生产合作社的发展情况，生产和中心工作的情况灵活掌握。如果是建社不久，可着重进行政治思想教育，树立社员的集体主义思想，然后适应社内生产发展情况，逐步增加文化课的比重，以满足社员在生产、生活上对文化的需要。河北沧县红光农业生产合作社，在建社初期，社员还存在着“入社试试看”、“怕在社内投资吃亏”等思想，社的领导人员就首先组织了一个政治班，有七十二个社员参加学习，以国家在过渡时期的总任务、办社经验和中心工作为教育内容，帮助社员树立了“社就是家”的思想，然后才逐步地增加了文化课程。文化课除采用编好的教材以外，还要根据生产需要，适当地补充一些内容。如河北永年县五区小北旺村秦振武农业生产合作社学员要求懂得记工票，就叫学员学写阿拉伯字码，并学些生产上常用的名词，如“锄地”、“打杈”、“积肥”等等。技术教育应随着生产季节的变化进行。如山西平顺县西沟村农业生产合作社，当种庄稼的时候，就请位村干部讲“毒谷”（系指以药搅拌种子，以防害虫），学员们按照干部讲的，在二百一十亩秋地种上了三百四十斤“毒谷”，结果出苗很好。另外，社内文化、政治、技术等教育应有专人负责。如浙江新登县龙羊区徐效荣农业生产合作社，除文化课请民校教师担任外，由社长徐效荣负责政治教育，团支部书记于理庭负责技术教育。
    第四、要注意教师的选拔、培养和对他们生活上的照顾。教师一般以从社内选拔为宜，必要时，也可以从社外聘请。据各地经验，社办学需要较多的教师，除每班应配备的教师以外，有条件时，可配备若干辅导员，便于当堂辅导，以巩固学员所学得的知识，也便于对学员分散复习的辅导。陕西兴平县赵家村农业生产合作社的民校，设置了十四名辅导员，协助教学，效果很好。教师如因教学耽误生产时，社里要尽可能地给予照顾。山西平顺县西沟村农业生产合作社采取了“换工”的办法，每年由社内给教师顶四十个劳动日（由公益金内开支），补偿业余教师的误工。另外，社领导人员应经常关心教师的培养提高，从精神上、社会地位上鼓舞其教学情绪。
    第五、农业生产合作社办学必须有健全的领导。首先，社内领导人员应对办学予以足够的重视，把它当作经常工作的一部分，积极加以领导、支持和监督。其次，应有统一的组织机构。若干地区已在生产管理委员会之下，设有校务委员会，由社务委员、教师、学员等代表组成，并指定社内主要干部任民校校长；如果是农业生产合作社联合办学，即由各社选出代表，联合组成校部或学习委员会。但无论那种形式，都必须在中共乡、村支部和乡政府统一领导下进行工作。山西平顺县西沟村农业生产合作社民校归社领导后，在社的全面计划中对民校工作也制订了计划和提出各项要求，所有的社内主要干部都做到“两管”，即管生产，也管学习，并定期召开会议，检查民校工作计划的执行情况。再次，由于有了一定的统一领导，才有可能统一安排学习、生产和会议的时间，保持学习的经常化。山西平顺县西沟村社的时间安排是，逢十开社务委员会，逢五开社员代表会或农业技术研究会，逢二逢八进行社内政治教育，另外留四次机动会议时间，如不开会就组织社员收听广播，其余为文化学习时间。在开社务委员会、社员代表会时，其余社员仍上文化课，缺课的实行领课、补课，这样每月可上二十次文化课。浙江新登县龙羊区徐效荣农业生产合作社，采取了各生产小组田地头评工、晚饭后（七时前）记分排工的办法，将评工记分时间和上课时间作了统一安排，保证了每晚两小时的学习，这样，既不妨碍生产和工作，又满足了社员的学习要求。
    目前农业生产合作社办学是有成绩的。但由于这是一项新的工作，还缺乏较成熟的经验，或由于对已办学的社缺乏具体领导，一般社办学的质量还不够高，有的还不够巩固。因此，各地对农业生产合作社办学，应加强领导，积极地有计划地开展这一工作。业务部门应注意培养和总结经验，推广经验，提高社办学的质量。而做好这一工作的关键又在于主动地紧紧依靠党委，争取有关部门的合作，取得群众的积极支持，使农民业余文化教育，更好地为农业的社会主义改造服务。
