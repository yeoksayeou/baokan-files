Jiangxi Helps Families of Martyrs and Military Personnel to Overcome Difficulties

Jiangxi is an old revolutionary base area from the time of the Second Domestic Revolutionary War. The province has a total of 1,440,000 families of martyrs, military personnel, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred military personnel. With the development of mutual aid and cooperation, the number of families of martyrs and military personnel organized into mutual aid teams has reached 49% of the total number of households. Many demobilized and transferred military personnel have become the backbone of mutual aid and cooperative organizations. After many families of martyrs and military personnel joined mutual aid and cooperative organizations, they solved the difficulty of lacking labor and increased production, voluntarily declining substitute farming. Now, families of martyrs and military personnel enjoying substitute farming account for only 28% of the total number of households in the province. In cities, more than 1,500 families of martyrs and military personnel have participated in production in local state-owned and various cooperative factories.

Last year, the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government allocated over 42.538 million yuan in kind and subsidies for children's schooling to families of martyrs and military personnel throughout the province, promptly solving the difficulties in production and life for poor families of martyrs and military personnel. For example, poor families of martyrs and military personnel in Xingguo County used the subsidies to purchase 95 head of cattle, more than 1,600 pieces of large and small farm implements such as plows and harrows, and more than 269,000 jin of fertilizer, repaired 103 houses, and purchased more than 9,000 dan of rations. In Kangle Town, Wanzai County, 12 poor families of martyrs and military personnel used to rely entirely on government relief. When the subsidies were distributed last year, the government helped them organize a handicraft production cooperative for making bamboo hats and ropes, where each person could earn about 3,000 yuan per day. Now, the schooling difficulties of over 20,000 children from poor families of martyrs and military personnel throughout the province have also been completely resolved.

    江西帮助烈属、军属解决困难
    江西是我国第二次国内革命战争时期的老根据地，全省烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员转业军人共一百四十四万人。随着互助合作的发展，烈属、军属组织起来的户数已达总户数的百分之四十九，很多复员转业军人成为互助合作组织中的骨干。很多烈属、军属参加了互助合作组织以后，解决了缺乏劳动力的困难，增加了生产，自动谢退了代耕。现在全省享受代耕的烈属、军属只占总户数的百分之二十八。在城市的烈属、军属到地方国营和各种合作社性质的工厂参加生产的，也有一千五百多人。
    去年全年江西省人民政府拨发各地烈属、军属实物补助费和子女入学补助费四百二十五亿三千八百多万元，及时解决了贫苦烈属、军属在生产上，生活上的困难。如兴国县贫苦烈属、军属用补助款添购了九十五头耕牛，买了犁、耙等大小农具一千六百多件和肥料二十六万九千多斤，修理房屋一百零三间，购买口粮九千多担。万载县康乐镇有十二户贫苦烈属、军属过去完全依靠政府救济度日，去年发放补助款时，政府帮助他们组织一个手工业斗笠、打绳生产合作社，每人每天可得工资三千元左右。现在全省有二万多贫苦烈属、军属的子女入学困难也已经完全得到解决。（本报江西记者站）
