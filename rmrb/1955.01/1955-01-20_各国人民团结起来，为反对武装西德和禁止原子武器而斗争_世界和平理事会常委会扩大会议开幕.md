    [Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 19th] According to TASS, the expanded meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council opened in Vienna on the evening of the 18th. Members of the Standing Committee and many invited representatives from thirty countries in Europe, Asia, the Americas, Africa, and Australia attended the meeting. Representatives from international democratic organizations such as the World Federation of Trade Unions were also present.
    The meeting was opened under the chairmanship of Frédéric Joliot-Curie, President of the World Peace Council. He read out telegrams from Pietro Nenni and Riccardo Lombardi, which stated that the current situation requires the people of all countries to unite and struggle against the re-militarization of West Germany and the threat of atomic war.
    Joliot-Curie announced the two items on the agenda for this meeting:
    1. Formulating the tasks of the peace movement in response to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council's decision on the use of nuclear weapons.
    2. Furthering the struggle of all peace-loving forces against the ratification and implementation of the Paris Agreements, which aim to revive German militarism.
    Reverend Forberg of Norway spoke first, calling on all Christians to actively participate in the struggle to ban the use of atomic weapons and oppose the re-militarization of West Germany.
    Alfred, one of the outstanding activists in the West German peace movement, said: The re-militarization of West Germany is causing growing anxiety among West German residents. A significant reason for this anxiety is that fascists and militarists are expanding their influence in West Germany. In talking about the struggle against the revival of German militarism, Alfred pointed out that West German youth are firmly opposed to plotting new wars, West German trade unions are opposing re-militarization, and an increasing number of West German religious figures, writers, artists, and actors have written to the government demanding the implementation of policies that promote negotiation and peaceful resolution of disputes. He pointed out that the Soviet government's statement on the German question provides the people of Europe, and especially the German people, with new opportunities to live in independence and security. Alfred called on German residents to intensify their struggle to defend peace and for the reunification of their homeland.
    Pritchard, the representative of the British peace movement, said that British public opinion vividly remembers the terrible consequences of World War II. He said that reviving the German "Bundeswehr" and giving it atomic weapons would greatly exacerbate tensions in Europe and increase the risk of a third world war. He pointed out that the British government's support for the re-militarization of West Germany is contrary to the views of the majority of the British people. He advocated the unconditional banning of atomic weapons and emphasized that the threat of such weapons is more serious for Britain than for other countries.
    James Endicott, the Canadian representative, said that the Canadian people do not want a new war and oppose the use of atomic weapons and the re-militarization of West Germany. He severely criticized the policies of the American ruling clique to prepare for a new war.
    Liu Changsheng, the representative of the People's Republic of China, said that the rearmament of West Germany and Japan seriously threatens peace in Europe and Asia. The struggle of the people of European countries against the rearmament of West Germany has always been fully supported by the Chinese people. He said: After the failure of the "European Defense Community," the warmongers formulated a new plan through the Paris Agreements that violates the interests of the people of European countries. Liu Changsheng emphasized that we are deeply convinced that the people of France and Germany will defeat this sinister plan. In the struggle for peace, against the re-militarization of West Germany, and for the establishment of collective security, the people of these countries and European countries can count on the full support of the 600 million Chinese people.
    Sereni, the Italian representative, advocated organizing a broad international movement against the rearmament of West Germany and for the banning of atomic weapons. He said that the people of all countries must unite against the preparation for a new atomic war and demand the unconditional banning of atomic weapons.
    Next, the French representative, D'Astier de la Vigerie, and the Soviet writer Ilya Ehrenburg spoke successively.

    各国人民团结起来，为反对武装西德和禁止原子武器而斗争
    世界和平理事会常委会扩大会议开幕
  　【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社维也纳讯：世界和平理事会常务委员会十八日晚间在维也纳举行扩大会议。常务委员会委员以及欧洲、亚洲、美洲、非洲和澳洲的三十个国家许多被邀请的代表都出席了会议。出席会议的还有世界工会联合会等国际民主组织的代表。
    会议在世界和平理事会主席弗雷德里克·约里奥—居里主持下开幕。他宣读了彼特罗·南尼和理卡多·龙巴迪的来电，电报中说，目前的局势要求各国人民团结起来，为反对西德重新军国主义化和原子战争的威胁而斗争。
    约里奥—居里宣布了这次会议的两项议程：
    一、针对北大西洋公约组织理事会关于采用核子武器的决定而制订和平运动的任务。
    二、进一步展开一切爱好和平的力量反对批准和实施目的在于复活德国军国主义的巴黎协定的斗争。
    挪威的福贝克牧师首先发言，号召所有基督教徒积极参加争取禁止使用原子武器、反对西德重新军国主义化的斗争。
    西德和平运动的卓越活动家之一艾尔费斯说：西德的重新军国主义化引起西德居民日益增长的不安，产生这种不安的显著理由是，法西斯和军国主义分子正在扩大他们在西德的影响。艾尔费斯在谈到反对德国军国主义复活的斗争时指出，西德青年坚决反对策划新战争，西德的工会纷纷反对重新军国主义化，越来越多的西德宗教界人士、作家、艺术家、演员已经写信给政府要求执行进行谈判以及和平解决争执问题的政策。他指出，苏联政府关于德国问题的声明为欧洲各国人民首先是为德国人民提供了能够在独立和安全的条件下生存的新的机会。艾尔费斯号召德国居民加紧为保卫和平、为祖国的重新统一而斗争。
    英国和平运动的代表普里特说，英国舆论清醒地记得第二次世界大战的可怕后果。他说，让德国“国防军”复活并且拥有原子武器将大大加剧欧洲紧张局势和增加第三次世界大战的危险。他指出，英国政府支持西德重新军国主义化的态度是同英国大多数人民的看法相违背的。他主张无条件禁止原子武器，并着重指出，这种武器的威胁对英国比对其他国家更加严重。
    加拿大代表文幼章说道，加拿大人民不要新战争，反对使用原子武器和西德重新军国主义化。他严厉抨击美国统治集团准备发动新战争的政策。
    中华人民共和国代表刘长胜说，重新武装西德和日本严重地威胁欧洲和亚洲的和平，欧洲各国人民反对重新武装西德的斗争是一直得到中国人民的完全支持的。他说：在“欧洲防务集团”失败以后，战争鼓吹者又通过巴黎协定制订了违反欧洲各国人民利益的新计划。刘长胜着重指出，我们深信，法国和德国人民将会击败这种罪恶计划。在争取和平、反对西德重新军国主义化、争取建立集体安全的斗争中，这些国家和欧洲各国的人民可以指靠六亿中国人民的全力支持。
    意大利代表塞伦尼主张组织反对重新武装西德、争取禁止原子武器的广泛的国际运动。他说，必须使各国人民团结起来，反对准备新的原子战争，要求无条件禁止原子武器。
    接着，法国代表达斯蒂埃·德拉维热里和苏联作家爱伦堡先后发言。
