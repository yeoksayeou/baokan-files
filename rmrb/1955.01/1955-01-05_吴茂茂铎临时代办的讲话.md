Ladies and gentlemen,

    Today is the seventh anniversary of the founding of the Union of Burma. I am very grateful to all of you for joining me in celebrating this joyous occasion. In the seven years since independence, Burma has laid the foundation for building a socialist state. In this regard, the main steps it has taken are: nationalizing land and huge foreign assets; democratizing administrative work so that the people can participate in practical administrative work at all levels; formulating laws to improve the situation of workers and train them to participate in industrial management; implementing free education up to university; and formulating long-term and short-term industrialization plans. In terms of social welfare, we have begun to implement a long-term plan called "Pyidawtha" to improve the social welfare of the people throughout the Union. The development of medical services has been so rapid that we have had to hire many medical personnel from abroad to cope with the situation. In the past seven years, the number of university students has tripled. Most of them are being trained as technicians; upon completion of their studies, they will find jobs waiting for them – the fields of development are indeed vast. Hundreds of students are also being trained abroad to take on the most important tasks. Thanks to the guidance and encouragement of the government, and thanks to the efforts of the people, Burma has regained its position as the largest rice exporter it held before the war.

    In international affairs, in the past seven years, Burma has made sincere efforts and contributions in easing international tensions and maintaining world peace. As a neutral country, it has not only striven to promote friendly relations between itself and all other countries, but also to promote friendly relations between all other countries. On this joyous occasion, I would like to make special mention of the relations between the Union of Burma and the People's Republic of China. The past year has been an unusual year, and history has recorded many new features in the development of Sino-Burmese relations. In April 1954, a trade agreement was signed in Rangoon, followed by a visit to your country in October by a Burmese government trade delegation led by Thakin Tin, Minister of Land Nationalization and Local Administrative Democratization, which resulted in the conclusion of a trade protocol on the exchange of goods between the two countries. During the same period, three other Burmese delegations visited the People's Republic of China. These delegations were the agricultural delegation led by Thakin Khin Tun, Burmese Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, in August; the trade union delegation led by U Ba Swe, Burmese Minister of Housing and Labor; and finally, the friendly visit delegation led by U Nu, Prime Minister of the Union of Burma, in December last year. I recall with great pleasure the visit of Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China to Burma in June. The mutual visits of the two prime ministers to each other's countries have infinitely strengthened the friendly ties between the two neighboring countries since the liberation of China in 1949. The Five Principles put forward by the Prime Ministers of Burma and China in their historic joint statement are of great importance, because they are not only the way to solve the current and future problems of Burma and China, but also the way to solve all international problems in a divided world.

    As you may know, Burma has faced various difficulties and hardships since its independence. Without the friendly help and cooperation of its friends far and near, it would not have been possible to achieve what it has achieved in these difficulties in such a short period of time. I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of the Government of the Union of Burma. We sincerely hope that Burma will continue to receive more and more help and cooperation from its friends in the years to come.

    I now propose a toast to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong;

    May the friendship between China and Burma be forever consolidated;

    May peace forever spread throughout the world.

### 吴茂茂铎临时代办的讲话

    吴茂茂铎临时代办的讲话诸位女士，诸位先生：
    今天是缅甸联邦成立七周年纪念日，我非常感谢诸位来与我一同庆祝这个喜庆的节日。在独立以来的七年中，缅甸已经为建立一个社会主义的国家奠定了基础。在这一方面，它采取的主要步骤是：把土地和巨大的外国资产收归国有；把行政工作民主化，使人民能够参加各级的实际行政工作；制定法律以改善工人境况并训练他们参加工业管理；实行直到大学的免费教育以及制订长期和短期的工业化计划。在社会福利方面，我们已经开始执行一个叫做“皮陶达”的长期计划，以提高全联邦人民的社会福利。医疗事业的发展十分迅速，以致我们不得不从国外聘请许多医疗工作人员来应付这种局面。在过去七年中，大学生数目增加为三倍。他们中大多数人正在被培养成技术人员；学业完成后，他们将发现工作在等着他们——发展的领域实在太广阔了。还有成百的学生正在国外受训练，以便担负最重要的工作。由于政府的指导和鼓舞，由于人民的努力，缅甸已经恢复了它在战前据有的最大的大米出口国的地位。
    在国际事务方面，过去七年中，缅甸在缓和国际紧张局势和维持世界和平方面，作了真诚的努力，也有贡献。作为一个中立国家，它不但努力促进它与一切别的国家之间的友好关系，而且努力促进一切其他国家之间的友好关系。在这个喜庆的节日，我愿意特别提到缅甸联邦和中华人民共和国之间的关系。过去的一年是不平常的一年，历史已记录下中缅关系发展上的许多新特点。一九五四年四月在仰光签订了一项贸易协定，接着，由土地国有化和地方行政民主化部长德钦阵领导的一个缅甸政府贸易代表团在十月间访问了贵国，结果，缔结了一项关于两国换货的贸易议定书。在同一时期，还有另外三个缅甸代表团访问中华人民共和国。这些代表团是八月间由缅甸农林部长德钦觉顿领导的农业代表团；由缅甸住房与劳工部长吴拉实领导的工会代表团；最后是去年十二月间由缅甸联邦总理吴努领导的友好访问团。我回想起中华人民共和国总理周恩来先生在六月间访问缅甸，也感到很大愉快。两国总理的相互访问对方国家，已使一九四九年中国解放以来两个邻邦之间的友好联系无限地加强。缅中两国总理在具有历史意义的联合声明中提出的五项原则具有极大重要性，因为它们不仅是解决缅甸和中国目前和将来的问题的方式，而且也是解决陷于分裂的世界的一切国际问题的方式。
    诸位可能知道，缅甸从独立之日起一直遭到各种艰难困苦。如果没有它的远近的朋友给予友好的帮助和合作，它在这样短的时期内在这些困难中所取得的成就是不可能取得的。对此我愿代表缅甸联邦政府表示感谢。我们真诚希望缅甸在未来的岁月中会继续得到它的朋友越来越多的帮助和合作。
    我现在提议为毛泽东主席的健康干杯；
    祝中缅两国友谊永远巩固；
    祝和平永远遍及全世界。
