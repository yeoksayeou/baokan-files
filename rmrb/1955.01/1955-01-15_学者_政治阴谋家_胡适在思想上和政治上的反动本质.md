	“Scholar”—Political Conspirator
	——Hu Shi's Reactionary Essence in Thought and Politics
	Zhang Pei
	I. Hu Shi is still a vicious enemy of the Chinese people

	Recently, a critique of Hu Shi's reactionary thought has gradually unfolded across various regions. This is a serious ideological and political struggle in Chinese academic circles—a struggle between the Marxist battle materialism and the bourgeoisie's reactionary idealism. The development and victory of this struggle will directly promote our country's socialist revolution, that is, socialist transformation.

	This struggle is just beginning, and the broad masses in academic circles have already joined in. Some people who were previously influenced by Hu Shi, some of whom have expressed their intention to cleanse their idealistic viewpoints from this ideological struggle and wholeheartedly participate in socialist construction.

	However, it must be pointed out that although Hu Shi has fled to the lair of his masters today, he still barks shamelessly like a rabid dog. Not long ago, when the American aggression group and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group signed the so-called "Joint Defense Treaty," which occupies our country's territory of Taiwan, antagonizes the Chinese people, and prepares to expand the war, Hu Shi, hiding in New York, immediately issued a statement expressing his "great satisfaction" with this traitorous treaty, praising it as the "best" treaty, and saying: "I am particularly interested in the last sentence of Article 6." What does the last sentence of Article 6 of this aggressive treaty say? It says that in addition to occupying our country's territory of Taiwan and Penghu, this aggressive treaty also stipulates that it "...shall apply to such other territories as may be determined by mutual agreement." These four words, "other territories," mean that US imperialism not only attempts to shift its aggressive spearhead from Taiwan and Penghu to the coastal islands of our country still occupied by the Chiang bandits, but also to point it at the liberated Chinese mainland. Hu Shi is naturally "particularly interested" in this, because the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group, including Hu Shi, is always dreaming of a restoration in all of China.

	Hu Shi is already a complete traitor. Hu Shi is still a vicious enemy of the Chinese people today.

	Over the past thirty years, Hu Shi has left extremely reactionary and negative influences in Chinese academic circles and society. These influences have not been fundamentally eliminated until recently. On the contrary, they continue to exert harmful effects. The fact that Mr. Yu Pingbo continues to spread reactionary idealistic viewpoints in the study of our country's great classical realistic work "Dream of the Red Chamber" is a clear example.

	From this, it can be seen that the struggle against the most vicious Hu Shi's faction's idealistic thought has great practical significance today.

	For many years, Hu Shi has disguised himself as a "scholar," actively serving the reactionary ruling class, thus making it difficult for ordinary people to recognize how his reactionary thoughts in academia and his reactionary political activities are closely related. When he spread extremely reactionary idealistic thoughts in various academic departments, he always sophistically called them "scientific methods" and "scientific attitudes." He also cunningly disseminated those deceptive slogans and propositions in popular forms through discussions of various practical issues to a wider range, making it difficult for many people to see through his conspiracies and tricks. For more than twenty years, Hu Shi has been closely linked with the Kuomintang reactionary rule, and is actually the commander of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group in the anti-communist and anti-people's cultural and ideological fields in our country.

	II. Under the command of US imperialism, Hu Shi's academic clique is the organizational basis of his reactionary political activities.

	The reason why the counter-revolutionary Hu Shi was able to widely disseminate his reactionary thoughts and carry out reactionary political activities is closely related to Hu Shi's academic clique controlling Chinese academic circles.

	In order to conquer the hearts of the Chinese nation spiritually and ideologically, the US imperialists, starting in 1909, used the so-called refunded Boxer Indemnity (which was originally the blood and sweat of the Chinese people) to cultivate and train personnel who would loyally serve US imperialism in accordance with the "American way," Hu Shi was one of the most loyal (most reactionary) ones, to realize its "offensive" policy of "dominating Chinese leaders intellectually and spiritually." In order to conceal this cultural aggression measure from the Chinese people and further control Chinese academic circles, the US imperialists established a so-called "China Cultural and Educational Foundation Board" in 1925, which on the surface was an administrative agency for handling the returned indemnity, but in reality was the executive agency of American cultural aggression in China. This cultural aggression institution belonged to the system of the largest financial monopoly groups in the United States, Rockefeller and Morgan. In order to implement its cultural aggression policy, US imperialism had to find loyal and reliable agents in China, and this candidate naturally fell on Hu Shi, who rose from secretary to chairman. More than a dozen major universities and many academic institutions were controlled by this institution. With such a solid "background," Hu Shi, together with reactionary elements such as Jiang Menglin, Zhu Jiahua, and Fu Sinian, formed a powerful academic clique and controlled Chinese academic circles through economic means. Thus, the situation emerged: US imperialism was able to promote its "offensive" policy, and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group had a powerful assistant in ruling Chinese academic circles.

	And what about Hu Shi? This institution fattened him up, and he was able to realize his "motorcycle" civilization. With this group as his support, he was able to carry out reactionary political activities more frantically, disseminating various reactionary ideas under the instructions of US imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek. This is why Hu Shi and his academic clique were always very timely and extremely active in opposing the revolution during every period of sharp struggle between revolution and counter-revolution. Not only that, but with this academic clique, Hu Shi could use various economic and political pressures to win over and buy off more people to serve him and spread their reactionary viewpoints. This is also the reason why Hu Shi's reactionary ideas were able to spread widely in various academic departments.

	Hu Shi's academic clique does not exist today, but those who once relied on this group or served this group should also thoroughly settle the crimes of this group ideologically and politically today.

	III. Hu Shi is the first major anti-Marxist ringleader in Chinese history.

	In July 1917, Hu Shi, who had received seven years of enslaving education under the US "offensive" policy, returned to China. To be fair, at this time, although Hu Shi carried the magic weapon of imperialist reactionary philosophy and waved the banner of "Western civilization," running to Pu Yi and shouting "Emperor," neither the remnants of the royalists nor the feudal warlords gave him any special favor at the time.

	Hu Shi was "depressed." However, Hu Shi is, after all, Hu Shi. He fully understands how to accumulate capital and open up his reactionary path in the future.

	In the midst of Zhang Xun's restoration, after some deliberation, Hu Shi decided to "build an innovative foundation for Chinese politics in thought and literature." Hu Shi used this elegant and lofty tone to beat his opening drums, pretending to "take philosophy as a profession and literature as entertainment" to wait for his opportunity to rise.

	Under the call of the world-shaking October Revolution, the storm of the great May Fourth Movement arrived.

	Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out:

	"The May Fourth Movement, at its beginning, was a revolutionary movement of the united front of three groups of people: communist intellectuals, revolutionary petty-bourgeois intellectuals, and bourgeois intellectuals (who were the right wing in the movement at that time)." As the spokesperson of the bourgeois on the right wing, Hu Shi participated in this united front. He advocated the vernacular, shouted slogans to overthrow the Confucian shop, and was good at speculation and deception. Under the circumstances that the masses' consciousness was not high, he established a certain "prestige" among some intellectuals. These are all facts, and this is the inevitable phenomenon under the historical conditions at that time.

	Then what was Hu Shi's initial motive for participating in the May Fourth Movement? Having been cultivated by American imperialism's "Western civilization" for many years, Hu Shi, who was like half an American, naturally had some aversion to the backward "Eastern way of life." Therefore, starting from the reactionary cultural viewpoint of imperialism, he attacked feudal culture to a certain extent, which is also very natural, this is one. Hu Shi, who hypocritically did not talk about politics, encountered such a great opportunity as the May Fourth Movement. His personal ambitions were eager to try, wanting to take advantage of the rising enthusiasm of the masses in anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism to take advantage of opportunities and deceive the public, in order to seize false fame in one fell swoop, this is two. But we must recognize that when Hu Shi participated in the May Fourth Movement, he had already spread the most reactionary bourgeois reformist philosophical and political ideas of the time in China, preparing to guide China to a reactionary political path according to so-called pragmatism. He did not expect that the socialist and communist ideological trends would so quickly and strongly attract Chinese advanced elements. Therefore, when the May Fourth Movement developed to "June 3rd," that is, after the movement had developed to the national scope, the thought of Marxism-Leninism was widely spread, and the labor movement began to rise, the cunning Hu Shi, who advertised "philosophy as a profession and literature as entertainment," "couldn't help it." He issued his first counter-revolutionary declaration, covertly but viciously. This is "study more problems and talk less about -isms." Although this article is thoroughly filled with anti-Marxist reactionary idealistic thoughts, Hu Shi cleverly disguised it, as if he was just telling people not to "engage in empty talk about abstract -isms," because "that is something that any Tom, Dick, or Harry can do." It is better to study some practical problems such as "rickshaw pullers" and "prostitution," "do everything from specific problems." Look, how "practical" Hu Shi is, how much he "cares about the people's suffering"!

	Hu Shi put on a beautiful posture of "peacock spreading its tail," using nice-sounding reformist slogans as trademarks and advertisements to sell reactionary bourgeois idealism, oppose the socialist and communist ideological trends that were deeply popular at the time, and maintain the vested interests of the feudal warlords. Not only that, but at that time, Hu Shi had already revealed his reactionary political desires, which he confessed very clearly in his article "My Crossroads" written in 1922. He said, "Politics is just a new effort that I can't help but make." That is to say, not long after the May Fourth Movement, his political ambitions had already sprouted. He also said in the same article, "If politics is separated from culture, then it becomes a lazy, otherworldly, and non-human culture." Here, Hu Shi is not referring to the general cultural tendency, but revealing that he had already attempted to combine his reactionary academic thoughts and reactionary political activities covertly. In 1930, in the article "Introducing My Own Thoughts," he made a clearer confession, saying that his debate with the communists on "problems and -isms" in 1919 was aimed at vigorously opposing the Chinese people from "being led by the nose by Marx, Lenin, and Stalin." Although his intention in saying this was to attack the communists, he after all confessed that at that time he was attempting to use trickery to strangle Marxism-Leninism, which was sprouting and growing on Chinese soil. Hu Shi is the first major anti-Marxist ringleader in Chinese history.

	IV. Hu Shi is a loyal subject who defends the interests of imperialism and the feudal ruling class.

	In 1921, the vanguard of the Chinese working class—the Communist Party of China—was officially established, and a huge change took place in Chinese political life. History declared that Marxism-Leninism must win victory on Chinese soil. Hu Shi, who was once the right-wing representative of the May Fourth Movement, became even more fiercely hostile to Marxism at this time, and from then on combined his reactionary thoughts and reactionary political activities.

	In 1922, China was in a state of division and fragmentation due to the warlords' separatist rule, and behind each feudal warlord was the political background of imperialism. The civil wars between the warlords directly reflected the deep contradictions of imperialism's interests in China, while the millions of people were groaning in disaster and suffering. At that time, the Communist Party of China represented the demands of the broad masses of the people, proposing "down with the warlords" and "overthrow imperialist oppression" as the basic tasks of the Chinese people at that time. However, Hu Shi was afraid of this just revolutionary action of the masses of the people and tried his best to stop it, attempting to turn the wheels of history in the direction of counter-revolution. Hu Shi first proposed the political proposition of "good people government" in the "Effort" weekly in May 1922, saying that he wanted a "constitutional government," an "open government" with "planned politics." As in the past, Hu Shi used some nice-sounding words to confuse the people, but in essence, he was vigorously promoting reactionary bourgeois reformism. He continuously organized discussions on "good people government" in the "Effort" weekly to "mobilize" social forces to resist the Communist Party's call for anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism and to maintain the reactionary rule of the feudal warlords.

	In order to resist the revolutionary propositions of the Communist Party, paralyze the masses' thoughts, and serve the interests of imperialism, especially US imperialism, Hu Shi published another article, "International China," in October of the same year, openly promoting that the danger of imperialist aggression against China no longer existed, and greatly praised the "banking group" in Beijing that sucked the blood of the Chinese people, saying that the American bourgeoisie had no malice. Finally, he even sang praises for all the privileges of imperialist aggression against China: concessions and Dongjiaomin Lane, foreign currency, Inspector General of Customs, postal customs rights, and so on. Here, the ugly face of Hu Shi's colonial comprador and slave is concentratedly manifested.

	While singing the praises of "Western civilization" and actively serving the interests of imperialism, Hu Shi was also respectful and flattering to the feudal warlords for the common interests of counter-revolution. When the Beiyang warlord Duan Qirui wanted to convene a National Assembly in order to resist Sun Yat-sen's northward journey before the Northern Expedition, and convened a "Post-War Conference," Hu Shi also went to participate and proposed a "Draft Law on the Organization of the National Assembly" to consolidate the regime of the feudal warlords.

	After the outbreak of the Great Revolution of 1925-1927, Hu Shi was in London participating in the Boxer Indemnity Committee, which enslaved the thoughts of the Chinese people. Although he was far away, he engaged in a political conspiracy, attempting to undermine the Great Revolution at that time. According to Lin Yutang's exposure in the supplement of the Wuhan Central Daily News: When the Northern Expeditionary Army fiercely attacked Wu Peifu, Wu Peifu asked another warlord, Sun Chuanfang, for assistance to avoid being annihilated. At this time, Hu Shi, far away in London, through his good friend Ding Wenjiang, "the Superintendent of Songhu," incited Sun Chuanfang not to provide assistance, the purpose being to let the Northern Expeditionary Army and Wu Peifu suffer both losses, and then let Sun Chuanfang eliminate the Northern Expeditionary Army and extinguish the Great Revolution. Hu Shi's political conspiracy did not succeed, because the Northern Expeditionary Army, with Communist Party members as the backbone, was brave and invincible, not only annihilating the warlord Wu Peifu, but also quickly annihilating the warlord Sun Chuanfang. However, the face of the disguised scholar and political conspirator Hu Shi was completely exposed.

	Because Hu Shi painstakingly maintained the interests of imperialism and the feudal class, he also opposed the revolutionary democrat Sun Yat-sen. Many people know that he once scolded Sun Yat-sen in "This Week" of the "Effort" weekly for preparing to use Guangdong as a base for the Northern Expedition, praising Chen Jiongming's rebellion, saying that it was a revolution.

	V. Hu Shi closely cooperated with the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group and launched a series of counter-revolutionary offensives in politics.

	After the failure of the Great Revolution of 1925-1927, the mainstay of the Chinese revolution, the Communist Party of China, entered a new stage of struggle, shifting from the cities to the countryside, leading millions of peasants to carry out land reform, and establishing revolutionary base areas. The Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group "encircled and suppressed" step by step, and the people were forced to carry out a cruel armed struggle, beginning the Second Revolutionary Civil War. At this time, in order to closely cooperate with the Kuomintang reactionaries' "armed encirclement and suppression" of the revolutionary forces, Hu Shi launched a series of counter-revolutionary offensives in thought and politics.

	The people who had been baptized by the Great Revolution had improved their level of consciousness and strengthened their will to fight. This was what Hu Shi feared most. In order to paralyze the masses' fighting mood, Hu Shi issued another counter-revolutionary political declaration in 1930. In his article "Which Road Shall We Take," he proposed that China had "five major enemies," but "capitalism is not among these five major enemies," "nor are feudal forces, because the feudal system collapsed two thousand years ago," "nor is imperialism, because imperialism cannot invade a country that is not entered by the five ghosts." Then who are the enemies? They are "poverty, disease, ignorance, corruption, and chaos." How vicious is the counter-revolutionary Hu Shi! He wanted to use this strategy of reversing cause and effect to deceive the people away from the path of revolution. He continued, "I would rather not avoid the name of counter-revolutionary than advocate these kinds of revolutions. Because these kinds of revolutions can only waste energy, incite the inferior nature of blind action and cruelty, and disrupt the tranquility of society and the country..." Here, Hu Shi exhausted all the slanderous words, wanting to place all the disasters and crimes caused by the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group on the heads of the Communist Party of China and the revolutionary people. Hu Shi's reactionary propaganda was even more vicious than Chiang Kai-shek's military "encirclement and suppression."

	Because Hu Shi had made meritorious contributions in anti-communism, Chiang Kai-shek personally summoned Hu Shi to "inquire about the overall situation" (Shanghai Declaration, Nanjing Special Telegram, October 14, 1930). Therefore, Hu Shi was even more devoted to the counter-revolutionary cause. In 1933, when the revolutionary armed forces of the Chinese people and Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary armed forces were engaged in a cruel battle, the insane Hu Shi bluntly said: "Any government should have the right to protect itself and suppress movements that harm it." This was a speech made by Hu Shi in the Shanghai North China Daily News on February 21, 1933, defending Chiang Kai-shek's criminal armed "encirclement and suppression" and the bloody white terror. The "scholar" Hu Shi immediately became Chiang Kai-shek's military spokesman.

	Around 1932 and 1933, while the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group was suppressing the revolutionary people by force, they strengthened the fascist rule and promoted the fascist education system in educational institutions at all levels, attempting to stifle the youth's rebellious thoughts and turn them into ignorant and docile people. However, the Chinese youth, who had the glorious tradition of the May Fourth Movement, did not succumb to violence and terror. They carried out a heroic struggle and shouted the slogan "Down with the Fascistization of Education!" Hu Shi did not lose the opportunity and immediately came out in the eighth issue of "Independent Review" to threaten and attack the revolutionary youth, saying: "Down with the Fascistization of Education is just a new trick concocted by a group of students who have no intention of studying but intend to make trouble..."

	At this time, Hu Shi and Chiang Kai-shek intensified their criminal activities against communism and the people in both civil and military affairs. In order to express his gratitude to Chiang Kai-shek for his importance, Hu Shi published an article "An Interpretation of the New Life Movement" in the 95th issue of "Independent Review" in 1934, describing Chiang Kai-shek, the most evil leader with his hands stained with the blood of the Chinese people, as an immaculate modern "great man," and greatly boasted about his fascist "New Life Movement."

	After the War of Resistance Against Japan, Hu Shi was sent to the United States to be an "ambassador" because of his anti-communist and anti-people activities for more than ten years. Hu Shi's "new political effort" that he couldn't help but make twenty years ago, that is, his political ambition, was realized. Although he went abroad, he did not forget to continue to shoot vicious arrows at the revolutionary people. He scolded the People's Army, which was bravely and resolutely carrying out guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, as "bandits," which aroused the anger of many upright people. During his tenure as ambassador to the United States, he signed several traitorous treaties with US imperialism. For Hu Shi, being able to directly sell China's national sovereignty and the people's interests to US imperialism was naturally the most "glorious" thing in his life.

	In 1948, while continuing to wage an anti-people civil war under the command of US imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group attempted to maintain its collapsing counter-revolutionary rule and convened a sham "National Assembly" that raped public opinion. Hu Shi not only became a representative, but also became the chairman. After the meeting, he himself revealed to others that Chiang Kai-shek had invited him to serve as "president" at an appropriate time. Later, Hu Shi did not become "president." The reasons for this are only known to Chiang Kai-shek and the political conspirator Hu Shi. But despite this, there is no doubt that the relationship between the counter-revolutionary Hu Shi and the public enemy of the people, Chiang Kai-shek, had reached its highest point.

	It must also be explained here that Hu Shi often accompanied his anti-communist and anti-people activities with anti-Soviet clamors. In 1948, the powerful peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union was taking shape. This was a serious threat to the thoroughly counter-revolutionary Hu Shi. In desperation, Hu Shi intensified his frenzied anti-Soviet activities. The reactionary magazine "Zhou Lun," published on February 6, 1948, published Hu Shi's "Two Questions in the International Situation." This article was full of slander against the Soviet Union. Hu Shi attempted to cover up the universally known fact and portray the Soviet Union, which had saved the civilization of all mankind in World War II and had always adhered to a peaceful policy, as a "terrible aggressive force." Listening to the voices of those adventurers in the American war group today, it is not surprising why Hu Shi wanted to say that at that time.

	VI. Hu Shi has always promoted national inferiority, advocated anti-patriotism, and actively advocated surrender to Japan.

	Although Hu Shi is Chinese, he does not have the slightest taste of loving his own nation. He not only completely erased our country's excellent national traditions and our nation's many contributions to mankind in culture, science, and other aspects, but also consistently promoted anti-patriotism, promoted national inferiority, and even actively advocated surrender to Japan. In 1930, Hu Shi said shamelessly in his "Introducing My Own Thoughts" article: "...We must admit that we ourselves...are not as good as others not only in material machinery, but also in morality, knowledge, literature, music, art, and body." Here, Hu Shi wanted to create a sense of inferiority that "everything is not as good as others" in the people's spirit, suppress the people's emotions, and open the way for imperialist aggression.

	After 1931, due to the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group's traitorous policy of civil war, it introduced large-scale aggression by Japanese imperialism, occupied the three northeastern provinces, and continued to advance into North China. The Communist Party of China, representing the will of the people who were boiling with anti-Japanese demands at that time, advocated stopping the civil war and resisting Japanese imperialism, but Hu Shi resolutely "supported" Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous policy of "internal pacification before external resistance," and continued the cruel military "encirclement and suppression" and the white terror that killed everywhere. Hu Shi believed that killing revolutionary people was the "right" of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group (see Hu Shi's speech in the "North China Daily News" in 1933 cited earlier), which was indeed awe-inspiring, but the just demands of the broad masses of the people to resist Japanese imperialist aggression were considered an unwarranted right.

	After that, Hu Shi published a series of proposals for compromise and surrender to Japan. In addition to shamelessly proposing that the Japanese aggressors should "conquer the hearts of the Chinese nation" and flattering Japan, Hu Shi published an article that stank for ten thousand years, called "We Can Wait Fifty Years," in the "Independent Review" published on April 2, 1933. Hu Shi wrote: "...In 1871, France ceded two provinces to Prussia, and it took forty-eight years to recover the lost land. We may have to prepare to wait four years, we may have to prepare to wait forty-eight years. What do four or five years or forty or fifty years count for in a country's ten thousand years of life?" Under the circumstances that the Japanese aggressors were driving straight in, the Northeast was lost, North China was in danger, and the people were as angry as fire, Hu Shi carried out this traitorous propaganda of compromise and surrender. What is even more infuriating is that the reason why Hu Shi wanted to say "wait another fifty years" was because he wanted to "be worthy of the United States," because the United States had issued an empty "non-recognition" declaration after Japanese imperialism occupied the three northeastern provinces. You see, although Japan had de facto occupied the Northeast, as long as the United States "did not recognize" it, what did it matter? Waiting another fifty years is not too much.

	Two weeks later, Hu Shi continued to promote the proposition of "absolutely not advocating war" for surrender to Japan in the same publication.

	At that time, Hu Shi so actively advocated compromise and surrender, on the one hand, to adapt to Chiang Kai-shek's criminal policy of eliminating the Communist Party and the revolutionary people, and on the other hand, it also reflected his consistent comprador nature of doing things according to the intentions of US imperialism. As everyone knows, before the "Pearl Harbor Incident," the United States not only did not stop Japan's aggression against China, but also transported a large amount of war materials to supply Japanese imperialism.

	Although Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Shi carried out traitorous surrender, the broad masses of the people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, launched an angry tide of the War of Resistance Against Japan. The "December 9th" student movement in 1935 became the fuse of the struggle. The traitor Hu Shi repeatedly attacked the student movement, scolding the students as "blindly following, credulous, and arbitrary"; however, Hu Shi wasted his efforts. The masses of the people had already united and organized under the leadership of their leader—the Communist Party. No counter-revolutionary political conspiracy could destroy the people's strong will to defend the motherland.

	After that, until the eve of the War of Resistance Against Japan in 1937, Hu Shi participated in the so-called "Low-Key Club," which advocated non-resistance to Japan by the great traitors Chen Gongbo and Zhou Fohai. He ran to Lushan and Nanjing, and had actively pursued compromise and surrender to Japan. We can see very clearly now that this Hu Shi is a traitor to the motherland who is extremely cruel to the people and shamelessly surrenders to the enemy.

	VII. Hu Shi is a typical example of American worship and enslaved thought.

	In Hu Shi's lifelong reactionary political activities, there is also a vicious trick, which is to glorify the material enjoyment created by imperialism by exploiting colonies and the blood and sweat of the working people of its own country as "Western civilization" and "American civilization," in order to promote enslaved thought and make the broad masses of young people blindly worship US imperialism. Hu Shi, who grew up sucking the milk of US imperialism, not only promoted the "motorcycle civilization" of the United States everywhere, not only completely denied the huge contributions made by our nation to the culture of the entire human race in history, but also turned black and white upside down, attributing China's backwardness caused by the oppression of imperialism and feudalism to the Chinese people's "laziness" and "satisfaction with simple life," concluding that the Chinese nation is a "lazy and unprogressive nation," and can only willingly endure imperialist aggression and feudal oppression. Therefore, Hu Shi loudly sang: "I am very unceremoniously criticizing our Eastern civilization and enthusiastically praising modern Western civilization." (The above quotations are from Hu Shi's "Introducing My Own Thoughts" and "Our Attitude towards Modern Western Civilization") When someone came out to oppose Hu Shi's enslaved thought, Hu Shi scolded like a slave: "...They never dreamed of what Western European civilization and American civilization are like..." However, Hu Shi never dared to mention what the imperialists who enjoyed "Western civilization" and the warships, cannons, and machine guns that represented the greatest characteristics of "Western civilization" had brought to the Chinese people since the Opium War in 1840. Hu Shi did not say it, but the people have a good memory. Let's just cite the "Shen Chong case" in 1946. This is a typical performance of "Western civilization" in China. At 8 p.m. on December 24, 1946, in Beijing, two American soldiers publicly raped Shen Chong, a female student of Peking University, in Dongdan Square. The American army forcibly stationed on Chinese territory was already uncivilized, and publicly raping our women was even more heinous. However, Hu Shi, who sang the praises of "American civilization," on the one hand, opposed the just actions of students striking and demonstrating, and on the other hand, actively defended US imperialism, saying that this atrocity that insulted our national dignity was only a "purely legal issue," and this "legal issue" could only be sent to the "US Naval Court" for processing after obtaining Hu Shi's consent. This was a great insult to the Chinese people and also one of the ugliest acts in Hu Shi's reactionary political activities.

	From the above description, we can roughly see the unity of Hu Shi's reactionary thought and reactionary politics.

	Hu Shi is a disguised scholar, a political conspirator, and a traitor. The influence of Hu Shi's reactionary thought has not been eliminated. This is not only because many people in our country's academic circles still have bourgeois individualistic prejudices, the super-class view that academics are unrelated to politics, and other idealistic thoughts, but also because Hu Shi's reactionary thought propaganda and reactionary political activities for thirty years are closely combined. Hu Shi is an extremely cunning conspirator who is good at deceiving people, and his academic clique has also helped the spread of his reactionary thought influence. After liberation, Marxism-Leninism has undergone unprecedented development and generated tremendous power among the broad masses of the people in our country. However, we cannot therefore say that bourgeois idealism has disappeared, let alone say that the influence of the most vicious faction in idealism—Hu Shi's reactionary thought—has been eliminated. In real life, Hu Shi's reactionary thought is still harming the people and is detrimental to the current socialist construction. Therefore, thoroughly exposing Hu Shi's reactionary thought and eliminating his negative influence in academic circles and society has great practical significance. All those who have ever followed in Hu Shi's footsteps or blindly followed Hu Shi should face the truth, see Hu Shi's true face, actively and bravely participate in the ideological struggle to criticize Hu Shi, transform and improve themselves from the struggle, and truly become a socialist builder. And Communists and Marxists should also learn a lesson from this struggle. We must take the propaganda of materialism and opposition to idealism among the masses of the people as a regular combat task, and constantly strengthen the leading force of Marxism-Leninism in all ideological fields, to ensure the victorious completion of our country's socialist revolution and socialist transformation.

    “学者”——政治阴谋家
    ——胡适在思想上和政治上的反动本质
    张沛
    一、胡适至今仍是中国人民的凶恶敌人
    最近各地已逐步展开对胡适反动思想的批判，这是中国学术界在思想与政治上的一场严重的斗争——马克思主义的战斗唯物论与资产阶级的反动唯心论的斗争，这个斗争的发展与胜利，将直接对我国社会主义革命即社会主义改造，产生极大的推动作用。
    这个斗争正在开始，学术界的广大人士已经参加进这一斗争中来，一些过去受胡适影响的人们，其中有一些已经表示要从这场思想斗争中，清除自己唯心论观点，全心参加社会主义建设。
    然而，必须指出：胡适今天虽然逃亡到他主子的巢穴里，但仍然如一只恶犬一样发出丧尽廉耻的狂吠。不久以前，当美国侵略集团和蒋介石卖国集团，签订了侵占我国领土台湾、敌视中国人民、准备扩大战争的所谓“共同防御条约”后，藏身纽约的胡适，马上发表谈话，表示对这个卖国条约“十分满意”，称赞这是“最佳的”条约，并且说：“我对第六条的末句特别感到兴趣”。这个侵略条约的第六条末句是讲什么呢？是说美国除了侵占我国领土台湾和澎湖以外，还规定这个侵略条约“……将适用于经共同协议所规定的其它领土。”这“其它领土”四个字，就是说，美帝国主义不仅仅企图把它的侵略矛头从台湾、澎湖移向仍被蒋贼盘据的我国沿海岛屿，而且要指向解放了的中国大陆，这胡适自然“特别感到兴趣”了，因为包括胡适在内的蒋介石卖国集团，时刻都梦想着在全中国复辟的。
    胡适已经是一名彻头彻尾的卖国贼了。胡适今天仍是中国人民的一个凶恶敌人。
    胡适三十年来在中国学术界、社会上，遗留下极为反动的恶劣影响，这些影响直到最近并没有得到基本清除。相反，还在继续发生有害的作用。在对我国古典的伟大现实主义作品“红楼梦”的研究上，俞平伯先生继续散播反动的唯心论观点，就是一个显明的例子。
    由此可见，反对最凶恶的胡适派唯心论思想的斗争，在今天有着巨大的现实意义。
    多年来胡适伪装成“学者”的身份，积极为反动统治阶级服务，因而使一般人不容易认清他在学术上的反动思想和他的反动政治活动如何息息相关，而他在各个学术部门散播极端反动的唯心论思想时，总是诡辩地说成“科学的方法”，“科学的态度”，他还狡猾地把那些骗人的口号与主张，用通俗的形式，通过各种实际问题的讨论，散播至更大的范围，使得许多人看不清他的阴谋鬼计。二十多年来，胡适和国民党反动统治紧紧结合，实际上是蒋介石反动集团在我国文化思想领域中反共反人民的指挥官。
    二、在美帝国主义指挥下，胡适的学阀集团，是他的反动政治活动的组织基础
    反革命胡适之所以能广泛散播他的反动思想和进行反动政治活动，胡适的学阀集团，控制了中国学术界有重大的关系。
    美帝国主义者为了在精神上、思想上，征服中国民族的心，从一九○九年起用所谓退还的庚子赔款（本是中国人民的血汗），按照“美国方式”，来培养训练为美帝国主义忠实服务的人员，胡适就是其中最忠实（最反动）的一个，来实现它“从知识上精神上支配中国领袖的方式”的“攻心”政策。美帝国主义为了在中国人民面前掩盖它这种文化侵略的措施，并进一步控制中国的学术界，在一九二五年设立了个所谓“中华文化教育基金董事会”，表面上是办理退回庚款的行政机构，实际上是美国文化侵略在中国的执行机关。这个文化侵略机构是属于美国最大的财政垄断集团洛克菲勒、摩根的系统。美帝国主义者要执行它的文化侵略政策，一定要在中国找忠实可靠的代理人，这个人选自然而然地落到胡适的头上，他从秘书一直做到董事长。受这个机构控制的有十几个主要的高等学校，和许多学术机关。胡适有了这样一个坚实的“后台”，和蒋梦麟、朱家骅、傅斯年等反动分子，结成了一个有势力的学阀集团，通过经济手段控制了中国的学术界。于是就出现了这样的局面：美帝国主义既能推行它的“攻心”政策，蒋介石反动集团统治中国学术界又有了一个得力助手。
    而胡适呢？这个机构把他养肥了，他自己可以实现“摩托车”文明了，有了这个集团做依靠，他就更能疯狂进行反动的政治活动，在美帝国主义和蒋介石的指令下，散播各种反动思想，这就是为什么在每一个革命与反革命斗争尖锐的时期，胡适和他的学阀集团，反对革命总是非常及时极为活跃的原因。不仅如此，胡适有了这个学阀集团，就可以用各种经济的、政治的压力，来拉拢、收买更多的人为他服务，传播他们的反动观点，这也是胡适的反动思想能在各个学术部门广泛散布的原因。
    胡适的学阀集团今天不存在了，但是曾经依靠过这个集团或者为这个集团服务过的人，今天也应该从思想上、政治上彻底清算这个集团的罪恶了。
    三、胡适是我国历史上第一个反马克思主义的大头目
    一九一七年七月，在美国“攻心”政策下受了七年奴化教育的胡适回到了中国。公平地说，这个时候，胡适虽然身藏帝国主义反动哲学的法宝，摇着“西洋文明”的幌子，跑到溥仪面前高呼“皇上”，但是，不论保皇余孽或者封建军阀，当时没有给予他什么特别的青睐。
    胡适“苦闷”了。然而胡适毕竟是胡适。他完全懂得如何积累资本开辟他日后的反动道路。
    在张勋复辟声中，胡适经过一番谋虑以后，决心“在思想文艺上替中国政治建筑一个革新的基础”，胡适用这种风雅清高的调子，打起了他的开场锣鼓，伪装把“哲学当职业，文学当娱乐”，来等待自己发迹的时机。
    在震撼世界的十月革命的号召下，伟大的五四运动的暴风雨来临了。
    毛泽东同志曾指出：
    “五四运动，在其开始，是共产主义的知识分子、革命的小资产阶级知识分子和资产阶级知识分子（他们是当时运动中的右翼）三部分人的统一战线的革命运动。”作为右翼的资产阶级的代言人，胡适参加了这个统一战线，他提倡过白话文，喊过打倒孔家店，加上他善于投机、骗人，在群众觉悟还不高的情况下，在一些知识分子中树立了一定的“威信”，这些都是事实，这是当时历史条件下的必然现象。
    那末胡适开初参加五四运动的动机是什么？受过多年美帝国主义“西方文明”薰陶、像半个美国人一样的胡适，对于落后的“东方生活方式”，自然也不无厌恶之感，于是他从帝国主义反动文化观点出发，对封建文化加以某种程度的攻击，这也是很自然的，此其一。假惺惺地不谈政治的胡适，碰到五四运动这样一个大好机会，骨子里的个人野心跃跃欲试，想乘群众反帝反封建的热情高涨之际，投机取巧，惑人耳目，以一举攫取虚名，此其二。但是我们必须认清胡适在参加五四运动时，已在中国传播当代最反动的资产阶级改良主义的哲学思想与政治思想。准备按照所谓实用主义，把中国引导到一条反动的政治道路上去。他没有预料到社会主义共产主义的思潮会如此迅速强烈地吸引着中国的先进分子。因此，当五四运动发展到“六三”以后，也就是说运动已发展到全国范围，马克思列宁主义的思想得到了广泛传播，工人运动开始高涨，这时，标榜以“哲学为职业，以文学为娱乐”的狡猾的胡适“忍不住了”，隐蔽地但是毒辣地发出了他的第一个反革命宣言，这就是“多研究些问题，少谈些主义”。尽管这篇文章彻头彻尾均是攻击马克思主义的反动的唯心论思想，但是胡适很巧妙地伪装起来，似乎他只是告诉人不要“空谈抽象的主义”，因为“那是阿猫阿狗都能做到的事”，还是多研究一些像“人力车夫”“卖淫”等实际问题，“凡事多从具体问题下手”，请看，胡适是多么“注重实际”，多么“关心人民疾苦”啊！
    胡适摆开“孔雀开屏”的美丽姿态，用好听的改良主义口号作商标、广告，来贩卖反动的资产阶级唯心论，反对当时深得人心的社会主义共产主义思潮，维护封建军阀的既得权益。不仅如此，胡适在当时，就已显露出他反动的政治欲望，这在他一九二二年所写的“我的岐路”一文中自白得很清楚，他说：“政治只是我的一种忍不住的新努力”，这就是说五四运动以后不久，他的政治野心就萌动了。他在同一文中还说：“如果把政治划出文化之外，那就又成了躲懒的，出世的，非人生的文化了。”胡适在这里不是指一般的文化倾向性而言，而是表露他当时已经企图把自己反动的学术思想和反动的政治活动，隐蔽地结合起来。一九三○年，在他所写的“介绍我自己的思想”一文中作了更明白的自供，说他一九一九年与共产主义者的“问题与主义”的论争，目的是要竭力反对中国人民“被马克思列宁斯大林牵着鼻子走”，他这话虽然用意是在攻击共产主义者，但他毕竟供出当时他是企图用掩眼法，来扼杀正在中国土地上发芽生长的马克思列宁主义。胡适是中国历史上第一个反马克思主义的大头目。
    四、胡适是维护帝国主义和封建统治阶级利益的忠臣
      一九二一年，中国工人阶级的先锋队——中国共产党正式成立了，中国政治生活中发生了巨大变化，历史宣告马克思列宁主义一定要在中国大地上取得胜利。一度是五四运动右翼代表的胡适，这时就更加激烈地与马克思主义为敌了，而且从此把他的反动思想和反动政治活动结合起来了。
    一九二二年，当时中国处在军阀割据的四分五裂状态中，而每个封建大军阀的背后又都有着帝国主义的政治背景，军阀之间的混战又直接反映着帝国主义在华利益的深刻矛盾，而呻吟在灾难与痛苦中的则是千百万人民群众。当时中国共产党代表着广大人民的要求，提出“打倒军阀”“推翻帝国主义压迫”，作为当时中国人民的基本任务，可是胡适害怕人民群众的这种正义的革命行动，并且竭力阻挡它，企图扭转历史的车轮往反革命的方向走。胡适首先于一九二二年五月在“努力”周报上提出“好人政府”的政治主张，说什么要一个“宪政的政府”、一个“公开的政府”要有“有计划的政治”，和以往一样，胡适用一些好听的词句来迷惑人民，而实质上呢，是大肆宣传反动的资产阶级改良主义，他在“努力”周报连续组织了“好人政府”的讨论，以“动员”社会力量，抵抗共产党提出的反帝反封建的号召，维护封建军阀的反动统治。
    胡适为了抗拒共产党的革命主张，麻痹群众思想，替帝国主义特别是美帝国主义的利益服务，在同年十月又发表了一篇“国际的中国”，露骨地宣传帝国主义侵略中国的危险已经不存在了，大大赞扬吮吸中国人民鲜血的帝国主义在北京的“银行团”，说美国资产阶级并无恶意，最后，甚至对帝国主义侵略中国的一切特权：租界与东交民巷、外币、总税务司、邮政海关权等等唱起了颂歌。这里，集中表现了胡适的殖民地买办奴才的丑恶嘴脸。
    胡适一方面高唱“西方文明”积极为帝国主义利益服务，一方面为了反革命的共同利益他对于封建军阀也是恭敬奉承的，当北伐前夕北洋军阀段祺瑞为了抵制孙中山北上想召开国民会议，而召集了一个“善后会议”时，胡适也去参加了，并且提出了巩固封建军阀政权的“国民会议组织法草案”。
    一九二五—一九二七年的大革命开始后，胡适正在伦敦参加那个奴化中国人民思想的庚款委员会，他虽远在万里以外，但从事了一项政治阴谋，企图破坏当时的大革命。根据林语堂在武汉中央日报副刊上的揭露：当北伐军猛攻吴佩孚时，吴佩孚向另一个军阀孙传芳求援以免于覆灭，这时远在伦敦的胡适，通过他的好朋友“淞沪督办”丁文江，策动孙传芳不去援救，目的是让北伐军与吴佩孚两败俱伤，然后再让孙传芳去消灭北伐军，扑灭大革命。胡适的政治阴谋没有实现，这是由于当时以共产党员为骨干的北伐军勇猛无敌，不仅消灭了军阀吴佩孚，而且也迅速消灭了军阀孙传芳。但是伪装的学者胡适的政治阴谋家面目，却是毕露无遗了。
    胡适因为处心积虑地维护帝国主义与封建阶级的利益，他对于革命民主派的孙中山也是反对的，很多人都知道他曾在“努力”周报的“这一周”中，大骂孙中山准备以广东为根据地进行北伐战争，盛赞陈炯明的叛变，说这是一种革命。
    五、胡适紧紧配合蒋介石反动集团，在政治上发动了一系列反革命进攻
      一九二五—一九二七年的大革命失败以后，中国革命的中坚力量中国共产党，进入了新的斗争阶段，从城市转入农村，领导千百万农民进行土地改革，创立革命根据地，蒋介石反动集团则步步“围剿”，人民被迫进行残酷的武装斗争，开始了第二次国内革命战争。这时的胡适，为了紧密配合国民党反动派对革命力量的“武装围剿”，在思想上、政治上发动了一系列反革命的进攻。
    经过大革命洗礼的人民，觉悟水平提高了，斗争的意志坚决了，这是胡适最害怕的，为了麻痹群众的斗争情绪，胡适在一九三○年又发出一个反革命的政治宣言，他在“我们走那条路”的文章中，提出中国有“五大仇敌”，但是这五大仇敌中“资本主义不在内”，“封建势力也不在内，因为封建制度早已在二千年前崩坏了”，“帝国主义也不在内，因为帝国主义不能侵害那五鬼不入之国”，那末仇敌是谁呢？是“贫穷、疾病、愚昧、贪污、扰乱”，反革命的胡适是如何恶毒呵，他想用这种倒果为因的策略，欺骗人民离开革命的道路，他继续说：“我宁可不避反革命之名，而不能主张这种种革命。因为这种种革命都只能浪费精力，煽动盲动残忍的劣根性，扰乱社会国家的安宁，……”胡适在这里用尽了污蔑的词句，想把蒋介石反动集团所造成的一切灾难和罪恶，加在中国共产党和革命人民的头上，胡适的这种反动宣传，比蒋介石的军事“围剿”更加恶毒。
    因为胡适反共有功，蒋贼亲自召见胡适“垂询大局”（上海申报一九三○年十月十四日南京专电），于是胡适更加忠心致力于反革命的事业了。一九三三年当中国人民的革命武装和蒋介石的反革命武装，正在进行残酷战斗的时候，丧心病狂的胡适直言无讳地说：“任何一个政府都应当有保护自己而镇压那些危害自己的运动的权利。”这是一九三三年二月二十一日胡适在上海字林西报发表的谈话，为蒋介石罪恶的武装“围剿”和血流成河的白色恐怖辩护，“学者”胡适，立刻变为蒋介石的军事发言人了。
      一九三二、一九三三年左右，蒋介石反动集团一方面武装镇压革命人民，一方面强化法西斯的统治，在各级教育机构中，推行了法西斯的教育制度，企图窒息青年的反抗思想，使他们变成愚昧无知的顺民，但是有着五四运动光荣传统的中国青年，没有在暴力与恐怖面前屈服，他们进行了英勇斗争，喊出了“打倒教育法西斯蒂化”的口号。胡适丝毫不失时机，立刻在“独立评论”第八号上，出马威吓、攻击革命青年，说：“打倒教育法西斯蒂化，只不过是一班无心求学有意捣乱的学生信口编造出来的一种名词新戏法而已……”
    此时，胡适和蒋贼，一文一武加紧反共反人民的罪恶活动。胡适为了表达对蒋介石如此看重他的恩情，一九三四年他在“独立评论”第九十五号上发表的“为新生活运动进一解”的一文中，把满手沾染中国人民鲜血的万恶之魁的蒋介石，描写为一个一尘不染的近世“伟人”，为他的法西斯化的“新生活运动”大加吹嘘。
    抗战以后，胡适因为十多年来的反共反人民的活动，得到了蒋贼的“犒赏”，被派到把他一手培养出来的美国去做“大使”了，胡适二十年前那种“忍不住的政治上新努力”，也就是政治野心实现了。虽然出了洋，但他丝毫没有忘却继续向革命人民射出恶毒的箭，他在国外大骂当时英勇卓绝、坚持在敌人后方进行游击战争的人民军队为“土匪”，引起了许多正直人士的愤怒。他在驻美大使任内，和美帝国主义签订了好几个卖国条约，对于胡适来说，他能够把中国国家主权和人民利益直接出卖给美帝国主义，自然是他一生中最“光荣”的事情。
      一九四八年，蒋介石反动集团，一方面在美帝国主义的指挥下，继续进行反人民的内战，一方面企图维护他即将崩溃的反革命统治，召开了强奸民意的伪“国民大会”。胡适不仅当了代表，而且还当了主席，会后他自己向别人透露，蒋介石曾经邀请他在适当时机出来担任“总统”。以后胡适没有做成“总统”，其中原因，只有蒋贼和政治阴谋家胡适知道，但尽管如此，反革命胡适和人民公敌蒋介石的关系，已经发展到最高点，则是没有疑问了。
    这里还必须交代一点，胡适在进行反共反人民的活动时，经常伴随着发出反苏叫嚣。一九四八年，以苏联为首的强大的和平民主阵营正在形成，这对于彻底反革命的胡适来说，是一个严重威胁，在绝望之中，胡适加紧了他疯狂的反苏活动。在一九四八年二月六日出版的反动杂志“周论”上，登载了胡适所写的“国际形势里的两个问题”，这篇文章通篇是谩骂苏联，胡适企图蒙蔽举世皆知的事实，把在第二次世界大战中拯救了全人类文明、一贯坚持和平政策的苏联，说成是“可怕的侵略势力”，听听今天美国战争集团的那些冒险家们的声音，也就不奇怪当时胡适为什么要这样说了。
    六、胡适一贯宣扬民族自卑心，鼓吹反爱国主义，积极主张对日投降
    胡适虽然是中国人，但他没有一点点热爱自己民族的味道，他不仅仅完全抹杀了我国优良的民族传统，我国民族在文化、科学等方面对人类的许多贡献，而且一贯鼓吹反爱国主义，宣扬民族自卑，直至活动对日投降。一九三○年胡适在“介绍我自己的思想”一文中，毫不羞耻地说：“……我们必须承认我们自己……不但物质机械上不如人，……并且道德不如人，知识不如人，文学不如人，音乐不如人，艺术不如人，身体不如人。”胡适在这里是要在人民精神上造成“事事不如人”的自卑感，压抑人民的情绪，为帝国主义侵略开辟道路。
      一九三一年以后，由于蒋介石反动集团的卖国内战政策，引进了日本帝国主义的大规模侵略，占领了东三省，并且继续往华北推进。中国共产党代表着当时沸腾着抗日要求的人民的意志，主张停止内战抵抗日本帝国主义，但是胡适却坚决“拥护”蒋介石“攘外必先安内”的卖国政策，继续残酷的军事“围剿”和杀人盈野的白色恐怖。胡适认为杀戮革命人民是蒋介石卖国集团的“权利”（见前引胡适一九三三年在“字林西报”上的谈话），确实是威风凛凛，但对于广大人民抵抗日本帝国主义侵略的正义要求，则认为是不应有的权利了。
    此后胡适发表了一连串对日妥协投降的主张。他除了无耻地提出日本侵略者应当“征服中国民族的心”，向日本谄媚外，在一九三三年四月二日出版的“独立评论”上，胡适发表了一篇遗臭万年的文章，叫做“我们可以等候五十年”。胡适写道：“……一八七一年，法国割地两省给普鲁士，过了四十八年，才收回失地。
    我们也许应该准备等候四年，我们也许应该准备等候四十八年，在一个国家的千万年生命上，四、五年或四、五十年算得什么？”胡适在日本侵略者长驱直入，东北沦陷华北危急，人民愤激如火的情势下，进行了这种妥协投降的卖国宣传。更令人切齿的是胡适之所以要说“再等五十年”，是因为要“对得起美国”，是因为美国在日本帝国主义侵占东三省后，曾经发表了一个空洞的“不承认”的宣言。你看，日本虽然在事实上侵占了东北，但是只要美国“不承认”，那还有什么关系，再等五十年并不多呀。
    隔了两个星期，胡适又在同一个刊物上，继续宣传“绝不主张作战”的对日投降的主张。
    当时胡适如此积极主张妥协投降，一方面为了适应蒋介石消灭共产党和革命人民的罪恶政策，一方面也反映出他一贯按照美帝国主义意图办事的买办本色。尽人皆知，“珍珠港事变”以前，美国不仅对日本侵略中国的行动不加阻止，而且运送了大量战争物资，供给了日本帝国主义。
    蒋介石和胡适虽然进行卖国投降，但是广大人民在共产党领导下，掀起了抗日斗争的怒潮，一九三五年的“一二九”学生运动成为斗争的导火点。卖国贼胡适则一再打击学生运动，骂学生是“盲从，轻信，武断”；可是，胡适枉费心机了，人民群众已经在自己的领袖——共产党领导下，团结起来组织起来了，一切反革命的政治阴谋，都不能摧毁人民保卫祖国的坚强意志。
    此后直至一九三七年抗战前夕，胡适参加了大汉奸陈公博、周佛海的主张不抗日的所谓“低调俱乐部”，他跑庐山下南京，都曾积极活动对日妥协投降。我们现在看得很清楚了，就是这个胡适，是一个对人民十分残忍对敌人无耻投降的祖国叛徒。
    七、胡适是崇美的奴化思想的典型
    在胡适一生的反动政治活动中，还有一种毒辣手腕，就是把帝国主义用剥削殖民地和本国劳动人民血汗所造成的物质享受，歌颂为“西洋文明”，“美国文明”，以此来宣扬奴化思想，使广大青年产生盲目崇拜美帝国主义的心理。吸吮着美帝国主义的奶长大的胡适，不仅到处宣传美国的“摩托车文明”，不仅一口否定我国民族在历史上对整个人类的文化所作的巨大的贡献，而且颠倒黑白，把由于帝国主义与封建主义的压迫所造成的中国的落后，归罪于中国人民的“懒惰”，“自安于简陋的生活”，结论是中国民族是“懒惰不长进的民族”，只好甘心忍受帝国主义的侵略和封建主义的压迫。于是胡适高声歌颂：“我很不客气的指摘我们的东方文明，很热烈的颂扬西洋的近代文明。”（以上引语，分见胡适“介绍我自己的思想”和“我们对于西洋近代文明的态度”二文）当有人出来反对胡适的这种奴化思想时，胡适就以奴才的吆喝说：“……他们绝不曾梦想到西欧文明与美国文明是什么样子。……”但是，胡适没有一次敢提到从一八四○年鸦片战争以来，那些享受“西洋文明”的帝国主义者，以及代表着“西洋文明”最大特色的军舰、大炮、机关枪，给中国人民带来了什么。胡适没有讲过，但人民的记忆是很好的，远的不说，我们就举一件一九四六年的“沈崇案件”吧，这是“西洋文明”在中国表演的一个典型。一九四六年十二月二十四日晚八时，在北京，两个美国兵公开在东单广场强奸了北京大学的女生沈崇。美国军队强行驻在中国的领土上，这已经不文明了，而竟公开强奸我国妇女，则更是滔天暴行；但是高唱“美国文明”的胡适，却一方面反对学生罢课示威游行的正义行动，一方面积极为美帝国主义辩护，说这件侮辱我国民族尊严的暴行，只是“纯属法律问题”，而这种“法律问题”在得到胡适的同意后，又只能送到“美国海军法庭”去处理。这是一个对中国人民的绝大侮辱，也是胡适在他的反动政治活动中最丑恶的行径之一。
    从上面的叙述中，我们大致可以看清胡适的反动思想和反动政治的一体性了。
    胡适是一个伪装的学者、政治阴谋家和卖国贼。胡适的反动思想的影响并未消灭，这不仅仅因为在我国学术界的不少人中，仍然存在着资产阶级个人主义偏见、学术与政治无关的超阶级观点，以及其它的唯心论思想，而且因为胡适三十年来的反动思想的宣传和反动的政治活动是紧密结合的，胡适是一个极端狡猾善于骗人的阴谋家，而他的学阀集团又曾经帮助了他的反动思想影响的流传。解放以后，马克思列宁主义在我国广大的人民群众中有了前所未有的大发展，产生了巨大的力量，但不能因此就可以说，资产阶级的唯心论已经销声匿迹了，更不能说唯心论中最凶恶的一派——胡适的反动思想影响已经消灭了。在现实生活中，胡适的反动思想，还在危害着人民，不利于当前的社会主义建设。因之，彻底揭穿胡适的反动思想，清除他在学术界社会上的恶劣影响，是有重大的现实意义的。一切曾经追随过胡适的脚步或者盲从过胡适的人，应当面对真理，看清胡适的真面目，积极勇敢地参加批判胡适的思想斗争，从斗争中改造自己提高自己，真正成为一个社会主义的建设者。而共产党员、马克思主义者也应当从这次斗争中得到教训，我们要把在人民群众中宣传唯物论、反对唯心论，作为一个经常的战斗任务，不断加强一切思想领域中马克思列宁主义的领导力量，保障我国社会主义革命和社会主义改造的胜利完成。
