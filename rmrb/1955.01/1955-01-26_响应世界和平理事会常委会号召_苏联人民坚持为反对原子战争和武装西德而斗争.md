Kotov, Executive Secretary of the Soviet Peace Committee, told a TASS reporter that the resolutions of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council marked an important stage in the powerful movement of people of all countries against the threat of a new war. He said that the Soviet people will continue to fight alongside peace-loving friends all over the world for the prohibition of atomic weapons and for the complete use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes.

    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十四日讯：苏联人民热烈欢迎世界和平理事会常务委员会的号召。苏联拥护和平委员会执行书记科托夫向塔斯社记者说：世界和平理事会常务委员会的各项决议标志着各国人民反对新战争威胁的强大运动进入了一个重要的阶段。他说，苏联人民将继续同全世界爱好和平的友人一道，为禁止原子武器、为把原子能完全用于和平目的而奋斗。苏联人民不只是这样要求，而且还在实际行动中贯彻了这一点。
    科托夫说，苏联拥护和平委员会已经收到了全国各地许多热烈欢迎世界和平理事会常务委员会的决议的信件和电报。这些信件和电报愤怒地谴责力图发动原子战争和复活德国国防军的人。他说，苏联拥护和平委员会打算不久在全国展开讨论这些决议的热潮。苏联人民将欣然在要求禁止原子武器的“告全世界人民书”上签字，从而表示他们为和平和人类幸福而奋斗的决心。
