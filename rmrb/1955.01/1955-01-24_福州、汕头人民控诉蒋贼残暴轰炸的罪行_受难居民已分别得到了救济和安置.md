Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: The bloody crimes of U.S.-made Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes frantically bombing Fuzhou and Shantou have aroused boundless anger among the people of all circles in the area.
    Workers from factories such as the Fuzhou Huaguang Match Factory, Fuzhou Automobile Maintenance Factory, Fujian Paper Mill, Fujian Pharmaceutical Factory, and Fuzhou Linen Textile Factory have all held meetings to denounce the crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. The workers resolutely stated that they must fulfill and overfulfill the state's production plan and strive to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan. Lin Zhuguang, Director of the Fuzhou Overseas Chinese Federation, said: We, all overseas Chinese and their families in the city, must do our jobs well and, together with the people of the whole country, strive to liberate Taiwan and defend world peace. Three of the four workshops of the Zhu Peng Handicraft Production Group in Taijiang District, led by Ye Daying, were destroyed by Chiang Kai-shek's planes. The raw materials were also burned. On the 21st, Ye Daying led the workers of this group to build new bamboo sheds on the original site, put up new signs, actively cleaned up the remaining materials, and prepared to resume production within two or three days. Ye Daying said: Since our production group was established last year, the income of the members has doubled, and our lives have improved. However, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits have destroyed our happy lives. We must produce more actively and resolutely support the struggle to liberate Taiwan.
    More than 3,500 people from all walks of life in Shantou City gathered on the evening of the 21st to denounce the bloody crimes of Chiang Kai-shek's planes killing people. Shi Zhenyi, a representative of the "South Sea No. 163" ship's crew, who was wounded by Chiang Kai-shek's planes, said angrily: "Two of our crew members were killed and twelve were injured by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. We have an irreconcilable hatred for Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, and we are determined to demand this blood debt from Chiang Kai-shek's bandits!" Representatives of all circles who denounced the crimes of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits at the meeting unanimously stated that they would take practical actions to smash the U.S.-Chiang treaty and actively support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan and the coastal islands.
    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 23rd: Residents of Fuzhou who suffered from the brutal bombing by Chiang Kai-shek's planes on the 20th have been resettled with the help of the local people's government and people from all walks of life. Fuzhou City established a relief committee on the 21st. Hundreds of cadres and more than 200 students from Fujian Normal College organized dozens of work groups to actively participate in the work of relieving the affected residents. Eight temporary shelters were set up near the bombed areas to solve the food and accommodation problems of the affected residents. A large number of quilts and cotton clothes have been sent to temporary shelters to provide warmth for the affected residents.
    Grassroots cadres and many residents in various districts of the city have gone to the bombed areas to take the affected residents to live in their homes. Workers from various enterprises and factories have also spontaneously brought food and money to help the affected residents. Many factories have also vacated some dormitories to resettle the affected residents. More than 20 townships in the suburbs of the city sent a large number of farmers to welcome the affected residents who were willing to live in the countryside temporarily.
    The injured residents have all been sent to hospitals for treatment. They have received good care. The heads of the Fuzhou Party and government have visited the injured refugees in various hospitals.
    The affected residents, who have received enthusiastic care from the people's government and people from all walks of life, have expressed their determination to turn grief and anger into strength, strive to restore the destroyed construction, support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan, and demand the blood debt from Chiang Kai-shek's bandits.
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 23rd: The Shantou Municipal People's Government and people from all walks of life care for the affected people who suffered from the bombing by Chiang Kai-shek's planes. The residents and sailors who were injured by Chiang Kai-shek's planes on the 19th were all sent to hospitals for medical treatment on the same day. On the 20th, people from all walks of life in the city formed three comfort teams to conduct cordial visits to the affected residents and sailors. The Shantou Seamen's Union also allocated cash to comfort the families of the affected sailors.
