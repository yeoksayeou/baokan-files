    It is Necessary to be Thrifty During the Spring Festival
    To the Editor:
    The Spring Festival is approaching, and people are happily preparing to celebrate. According to custom, everyone hopes to eat better and engage in more cultural and recreational activities during the Spring Festival, which is essential. However, every year, some phenomena of excessive eating, drinking, and extravagance occur in various places during the Spring Festival. Especially this year, many farmers in some areas have achieved bumper harvests, and the living standards of some state organ employees have also gradually improved, making such waste even more worthy of attention and prevention. As the country's first Five-Year Plan enters a new year, not only should all state organs pay attention to thrift, but each of us should also pay attention to thrift to support national economic construction. Therefore, I suggest that everyone celebrate the Spring Festival under the principle of strict economy.

    过春节应当注意节约编辑同志：
    春节快到了，人们都在欢欢喜喜地准备过节。按照习惯，每逢春节大家都希望吃得好一些，并且搞好文化娱乐活动，这是十分必要的。但是，每年春节各地就发生一些大吃大喝铺张浪费的现象，特别今年许多地区的农民得到了丰收，一些国家机关工作人员的生活也逐步提高了，这种浪费现象更值得注意防止。当着国家第一个五年计划进入新的一年的时候，不仅一切国家机关应当注意节约，我们每个人也都应当注意节约，支援国家经济建设。因此，我建议大家在厉行节约的原则下过好春节。
