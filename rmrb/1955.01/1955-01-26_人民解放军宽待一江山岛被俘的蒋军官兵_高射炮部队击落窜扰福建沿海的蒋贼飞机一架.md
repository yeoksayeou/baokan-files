Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, January 25th: In the battle to liberate Yijiangshan Island, the more than 500 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers captured by our army have received generous treatment from the People's Liberation Army.

On the evening of the 18th, when this group of captured Chiang Kai-shek soldiers was sent to a rear area, the People's Liberation Army units made arrangements for their living. Severely wounded prisoners have been sent to hospitals for treatment, and lightly wounded prisoners also have PLA military doctors regularly changing their bandages and checking their injuries. Each prisoner received a toothbrush, toothpaste, soap, towel, shoes, cotton quilt, and cigarettes. Some Chiang Kai-shek soldiers' clothes were so tattered that they could no longer be worn, and the People's Liberation Army reissued new cotton-padded clothes to them. On the evening of the 22nd, a unit of the People's Liberation Army also showed a movie to the prisoners.

The People's Liberation Army's generous treatment greatly moved the Chiang Kai-shek prisoners. Many prisoners angrily denounced the Chiang bandits for their deceitful propaganda. Prisoner Yu Changhua was moved to tears when he received the items distributed to him by the People's Liberation Army and learned that his family on the mainland had received relief from the People's Government. He repeatedly expressed his gratitude to the People's Liberation Army.

Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, January 25th: Our People's Liberation Army anti-aircraft artillery unit shot down a Chiang bandit plane harassing the coastal areas of Fujian on the 24th. From 6:50 AM to 11:11 AM on the 24th, a total of 14 sorties of American-made Chiang bandit F-47, F-84, and other types of aircraft in three batches harassed the airspace over Zhangpu, Xiamen, Gaoshan, Fuzhou, and other areas. Our army's anti-aircraft artillery opened fire fiercely, shooting down a Chiang bandit F-47 aircraft that was harassing the Xiamen area. The plane crashed into the sea south of Jinmen Island.

    人民解放军宽待一江山岛被俘的蒋军官兵
    高射炮部队击落窜扰福建沿海的蒋贼飞机一架
    【新华社浙江前线二十五日电】在解放一江山岛战斗中被我军俘掳的五百多名蒋军官兵，受到了人民解放军的宽大待遇。
    十八日晚，当这一批被我俘掳的蒋军官兵被送到后方某地时，人民解放军部队就对他们的生活进行了安排。负重伤的俘虏都已送到医院中治疗，负轻伤的俘虏也有人民解放军的军医为他们经常换药和检查伤势。每个俘虏都得到了牙刷、牙膏、肥皂、毛巾、鞋子、棉被和香烟。有些蒋军官兵的衣服已经破得不能再穿，人民解放军给他们补发了新的棉衣。二十二日晚上，人民解放军某部还为俘虏们放映了电影。
    人民解放军的宽大待遇，使蒋军俘虏们非常感动。很多俘虏痛骂蒋贼对他们的欺骗宣传。俘虏余长华在领到人民解放军发给他的东西，并且得知他在大陆上的家庭得到人民政府的救济时，就感动得痛哭起来，并一再向人民解放军表示谢意。
    【新华社福建前线二十五日电】我人民解放军高射炮部队二十四日击落窜扰福建沿海地区蒋贼飞机一架。二十四日六时五十分到十一时十一分，美制蒋贼F—四七型、F—八四型等型飞机共三批十四架次，分别窜扰漳浦、厦门、高山、福州等地区上空。我军高射炮猛烈开火，击落窜扰厦门地区蒋贼F—四七型飞机一架。这架飞机落在金门岛以南海面。
