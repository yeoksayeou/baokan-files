Xinhua News Agency: As the Belgian House of Representatives debated the Paris Agreements, the Belgian people intensified their struggle against them. “Red Flag” newspaper published numerous reports from towns and cities across the country, detailing the struggle of Belgian patriotic forces against the Paris Agreements. Throughout the country, signatures are being collected to protest the revival of the German "Wehrmacht," and meetings are being held, passing resolutions demanding that members of the Belgian House of Representatives and Senate not ratify the Paris Agreements.

The congress of the Independent Front Committee of the central Belgian provinces unanimously passed a resolution on the 9th protesting the Paris Agreements. The resolution demanded that parliamentarians not ratify these agreements. The congress appointed a delegation to submit an appeal against the Paris Agreements to the Belgian House of Representatives.

In the central provinces, a signature campaign is underway to protest the decision to arm West Germany. The Belgian Women's League for the Defense of Peace is playing an active role in this movement.

The women's association of Aalst sent a delegation to visit the locally elected parliamentarians, demanding that they not vote in favor of the Paris Agreements.

On the 10th, at the initiative of the Committee for a Peaceful Solution to the German Question, an international conference was held in Brussels to protest the arming of West Germany. Participants included people from all walks of life with different political views. Speakers at the conference included Cardona, a professor at the University of Rome and a member of the Central Committee of the Italian Socialist Party; Parkin, a member of the British Labour Party; Leman, a former member of the Executive Committee of the French Radical Socialist Party; and Brummer, a lawyer from the Paris Court. They sharply criticized the policies of their countries' current governments, which, disregarding the will of the people, were trying to ratify the London and Paris Agreements to arm West Germany. The conference unanimously passed a resolution protesting the revival of West German militarism and decided to submit the resolution to the members of the Belgian Parliament.

[Xinhua News Agency, January 16th] According to TASS: The Belgian House of Representatives held debates on the issue of ratifying the Paris Agreements from the 11th to the 13th. The vote on ratifying the Paris Agreements is scheduled to take place on the 20th.

At the beginning of the debate, Liberal Party member Kronacker, Socialist Party member Pierson, and former Minister of Colonies Wynen stated in their speeches that their parties would vote in favor of ratifying the Paris Agreements. Their reasoning was that it seemed easier to resolve disputes with "strength as a backing."

Communist Party member Terf attacked the Belgian government's policy of trying to ratify the Paris Agreements. Terf refuted the claim that establishing a West German army would create conditions for negotiations and easing the situation with greater strength, asking: Will these armies really create conditions for reaching agreements and easing the situation? He said, if we arm Germany, then sooner or later we will be responsible for it.

Disregarding Kronacker's claim about the Liberal Party group's unified opinion, Liberal Party member De Motter spoke against ratifying the Paris Agreements. De Motter demanded that parliamentarians refuse to ratify the Paris Agreements because the agreement stipulated the rearmament of "Germany, which has launched three wars of aggression since 1870."

Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak said at the end of the debate on the 13th that if the Paris Agreements were not ratified, West Germany could not join the Atlantic bloc, which would mean "the end of Europe." At the same time, Spaak was forced to admit, in response to questions from parliamentarians, that he did not have a clear idea of how the "Western European Union" would function.

The Speaker of the House, Huysmans, then read out a proposal from the Belgian Communist Party parliamentary group, recommending that a referendum be held on the ratification of the Paris Agreements, and demanding that the government "make every effort to convene an international conference to discuss the most appropriate way to resolve the German question within the framework of disarmament, collective security, and peaceful policies."

Huysmans refused to put the proposal to a vote, insisting that the referendum proposal was "unconstitutional."

    比利时人民加紧进行反对巴黎协定的斗争
    据新华社讯：在比利时下议院辩论巴黎协定前后，比利时人民加紧进行反对巴黎协定的斗争。“红旗报”登载了从全国各城镇发来的许多消息，报道比利时爱国力量反对巴黎协定的斗争。各地都在征集抗议复活德国“国防军”的签名，并举行集会，通过决议，要求比利时下议院和上议院的议员们不要批准巴黎协定。
    比利时中部各省独立阵线委员会大会九日一致通过抗议巴黎协定的决议。决议要求议员们不批准这些协定。大会指派了一个代表团，向比利时下议院提出反对巴黎协定的呼吁书。
    在中部各省，为抗议武装西德的决议征集签名的运动正在展开。比利时妇女保卫和平联盟在这个运动中发挥了积极的作用。
    阿罗斯特的妇女协会派代表团去访问当地选出的议员们，要求他们不要投票支持巴黎协定。
    十日，在争取和平解决德国问题委员会倡议下，布鲁塞尔举行了一次抗议武装西德的国际大会，参加大会的有各行各业的具有不同政治见解的人。在大会上发言的有罗马大学教授、意大利社会党中央委员会委员卡尔多纳，英国工党议员帕金，法国激进社会党前执行委员会委员勒曼，巴黎法院律师布吕梅尔。他们尖锐地批评了他们国家的现政府不顾各国人民的意志、竭力设法批准伦敦和巴黎协定以武装西德的政策。大会一致通过了抗议复活西德军国主义的决议，并决定把这个决议提交比利时议会的议员们。
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社讯：比利时下议院从十一日到十三日举行了关于批准巴黎协定问题的辩论。关于批准巴黎协定问题的投票预定在二十日举行。
    辩论开始时，自由党员克罗纳克、社会党员皮尔逊和前殖民大臣文尼在发言中表示，他们的党将投票赞成批准巴黎协定。他们的理由是有“实力作后盾”似乎更容易解决争执问题。
    共产党议员特尔夫抨击了比利时政府竭力想批准巴黎协定的政策。特尔夫驳斥建立西德军队以便以更大的实力来进行谈判的说法，他质问说：难道这些军队真的会替达成协议和缓和局势创造条件吗？他说，我们如果把德国武装起来，那么我们迟早要对这件事负责。
    自由党员德莫特尔不顾克罗纳克关于自由党党团意见一致的说法，在发言中反对批准巴黎协定。德莫特尔要求议员们拒绝批准巴黎协定，因为这个协定规定重新武装“从一八七零年起曾经三次发动侵略战争的德国”。
    比利时外交大臣斯巴克在十三日结束辩论时说，如果巴黎协定得不到批准，西德不能加入大西洋集团，那就意味着“欧洲的末日”。同时，斯巴克在回答议员的质问时，却被迫承认他对于“西欧联盟”如何起作用的问题并没有清楚的概念。
    会议主席余斯曼接着宣读了比利时共产党议会党团提出的建议，建议要求就批准巴黎协定举行公民投票，并且要求政府“尽一切努力来召开一个国际会议，以便在裁军、集体安全和和平的政策的范围内讨论以最合适的方法解决德国问题”。
    余斯曼拒绝把这个建议交付表决，他硬说公民投票的建议是“违宪”的。
