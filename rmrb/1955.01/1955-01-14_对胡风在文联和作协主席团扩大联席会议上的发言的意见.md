Opinions on Hu Feng's Speech at the Enlarged Joint Meeting of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Writers Association

An Opinion from a "Literary Gazette" Correspondent

A Submission from Dalian Reader Ye Deyu - "An Opinion from a 'Literary Gazette' Correspondent" says: In his speech at the Enlarged Joint Meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the China Writers Association, Mr. Hu Feng expressed extreme indignation and dissatisfaction with the work of the "Literary Gazette" correspondents. Mr. Hu Feng believes that the "internal bulletin" issued by the "Literary Gazette" to its correspondents is an "underground publication." As a reader and correspondent of the "Literary Gazette," I cannot help but say a few words about this matter.

As far as I know, the organization of correspondent networks and the publication of internal publications is not unique to the "Literary Gazette." Many newspapers and periodicals adopt similar measures to educate and cultivate correspondents. Why does Mr. Hu Feng express such fervent hatred towards this measure of the "Literary Gazette" alone? Mr. Hu Feng himself has revealed the reason. He said: "In this 'internal bulletin,' orders are issued to the correspondents, calling for the criticism and attack of certain individuals, issuing calls for correspondents to write letters, hold forums, write articles, and create a 'mass base.'"

Although it is not directly stated that "some correspondents" sent him that issue of the "internal bulletin" due to "dissatisfaction," the meaning is very clear. The "Literary Gazette Correspondent Internal Bulletin" once called on correspondents to launch a criticism of Mr. Hu Feng's literary and artistic thought. According to Mr. Hu Feng, this is the "Literary Gazette"'s call to "attack" him.

The "Literary Gazette" has carried out a criticism of Mr. Hu Feng's anti-Marxist literary and artistic thought, which is entirely necessary and correct.

As everyone knows, Mr. Hu Feng's literary and artistic thought once had a significant negative impact on a section of petty-bourgeois intellectuals. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the small literary group headed by Mr. Hu Feng, wearing the cloak of Marxism, fervently advocated non-proletarian literary and artistic thought. They praised "primitive vitality" and individualism, unilaterally exaggerated the role of "subjective fighting spirit," and replaced class struggle with individual resistance. Mr. Hu Feng also promoted the theory that "where there is life, there is struggle," guiding a section of petty-bourgeois intellectuals who lacked the courage to devote themselves to the struggle of the masses onto a path fundamentally opposed to Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought. Mr. Hu Feng's literary and artistic thought is precisely a reflection of bourgeois individualism and reactionary idealist viewpoints in literary theory. This literary and artistic thought, reflected in creation, is prominently manifested in a series of works by Lu Ling at the time. The workers and peasants in Lu Ling's works mostly possessed strong individualistic and anarchistic ideas, with the style of the lumpenproletariat. Lu Ling's 800,000-word novel, "The Sons and Daughters of the Landlord," was praised by Mr. Hu Feng as "a major event in the history of new Chinese literature." The characters in the book are almost all incomprehensible, hysterical individuals. Mr. Hu Feng's literary and artistic thought still seriously affects the theoretical criticism and creation of some writers today.

Because of his opposition to Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought, for a considerable period, Mr. Hu Feng and some people under his influence aimed their pens not at the enemy, but wantonly attacked, excluded, ridiculed, and slandered the works of progressive literary and artistic writers who appeared displeasing to them or who did not follow them, and even attacked the Party's leadership over literary and artistic work.

This erroneous literary and artistic thought, headed by Mr. Hu Feng, and the sectarian sentiments did not change much even after liberation. In some respects, they became even more intolerable. In order to uphold the leading position of the working class ideology in the literary and artistic field, in order to establish and consolidate Marxist literary and artistic thought, the literary and artistic circles conducted a criticism of Mr. Hu Feng's bourgeois literary and artistic thought in 1952 and 1953 to clear up the bad influence of this thought on some readers. This was entirely necessary.

There is no need to hide that I was once an ordinary reader who blindly worshiped Mr. Hu Feng. It was from that struggle that I realized the errors of Mr. Hu Feng's literary and artistic thought and its harm to my own progress.

Under the leadership of the Party, the "Literary Gazette," in order to more thoroughly eliminate the influence of Mr. Hu Feng's literary and artistic thought among some readers, and in order to more effectively enable Mr. Hu Feng to recognize his mistakes, requested correspondents to actively participate in this ideological struggle in the "Literary Gazette Correspondent Internal Bulletin." This is precisely a serious ideological struggle task that the "Literary Gazette" is duty-bound to undertake. The development of this ideological criticism is in line with the requirements of the vast majority of readers.

The "Literary Gazette" does have many shortcomings and errors in its work with correspondents. The "Literary Gazette Correspondent Internal Bulletin" sometimes also published texts with serious errors. This is related to the shortcomings and errors in the entire work of the "Literary Gazette" editorial department. However, it cannot be concluded that the "Literary Gazette"'s action in 1952 of calling on correspondents to actively participate in the criticism of Hu Feng's literary and artistic thought was also wrong.

If Mr. Hu Feng truly proceeds from the interests of the people, he should welcome the criticism from the Party and the "Literary Gazette." If Mr. Hu Feng can seriously consider the opinions of many comrades, he should recognize his mistakes and the harmfulness of these mistakes. However, judging from Mr. Hu Feng's speech this time, he still lacks a sufficient understanding of his mistakes. Otherwise, he would not understand the criticism of his erroneous thoughts as "attacking certain individuals."

The reason why Mr. Hu Feng believes that the criticism of his literary and artistic thought in 1952 was "attacking certain individuals" has historical roots. Shu Wu pointed out in his "Open Letter to Lu Ling" ("Literary Gazette" No. 18, 1952), when exposing their then-vile sectarian sentiments and activities: "We even used the petty-bourgeois rotten vulgar eyes to look backward instead of forward, to measure others' hearts by our own, and to never forget and relish certain 'anecdotes' in the history of the literary movement, using the 'back-street old hag' method described by Lu Xun to interpret the entire great people's literary movement in the liberated areas after the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art as a trick used by a few leading comrades to attack someone. In this way, in literary and artistic work, there seemed to be no principles, no leadership from the Party, only a confused mess of private grievances; and within the Party's literary and artistic work, there seemed to be no principles, no organization, no organizational leadership, allowing one or two people to mess around at will, using public affairs to avenge private grudges, actually stirring up the whole country, and no one even cared. Only our small group was 'struggling to uphold principles' and was the only light, the pillar in the midstream." (Emphasis added by the author). Shu Wu's words were directed at the situation ten years ago. Unfortunately, the basic emotions expressed by Mr. Hu Feng in this speech are still the same. It is very clear that Mr. Hu Feng's speech is essentially not only an attack on the "Literary Gazette."

Let's Make the Secret Public

Li Xiaobai from the Northwest People's Song and Dance Troupe in Xi'an submitted an article titled "Let's Make the Secret Public," with the following summary:

We warmly welcome the speeches of Comrade Liu Baiyu and others published in the "Literary Gazette" No. 22, 1954. This will not only help the "Literary Gazette" to examine its work but also educate the vast number of readers. There is a common point in these speeches, that is, they hope that the "Literary Gazette" will immediately correct its mistakes and truly become a guiding and combative publication on the literary and artistic front. These speeches are severe and sharp, but they are sincere. They are based on strengthening the Party's literary and artistic cause and aimed at defeating bourgeois ideology.

However, I am very dissatisfied with Mr. Hu Feng's speech, which is simply intolerable! Of course, Mr. Hu Feng's speech has its correct points, but the essence of this nearly 20,000-word speech is that Mr. Hu Feng is using the criticism of the "Literary Gazette" as a pretext to promote his own erroneous literary and artistic theories and is trying his best to act as a defense lawyer for Mr. A Long's erroneous argument of "competing for the qualification of the 'protagonist' with the worker-peasant class by using other classes in literary creation" (Zhou Yang: "We Must Fight"). Is Mr. Hu Feng criticizing and helping the "Literary Gazette" to improve its work in order to safeguard the Party's literary and artistic cause, or is he attacking the "Literary Gazette" in opposition to the Party's literary and artistic cause? In my understanding, his starting point is the latter.

Comrade Zhou Yang has already spoken for everyone in his article "We Must Fight" and Comrade Yuan Shuipai in his speech about his erroneous views. We wholeheartedly support these two speeches. Now, I will express my opinion on Mr. Hu Feng's criticism of the "Literary Gazette"'s correspondent work in order to illustrate Mr. Hu Feng's attitude towards the Party's literary and artistic cause and the inside story of his speech.

The "Literary Gazette" is the organ publication of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles. It needs to understand the literary and artistic creation activities across the country. This is beyond reproach. In that case, organizing correspondents is one way to solve this problem. There is nothing wrong with using this method. If there are errors in the specific work of using this method, that is another matter, and it should not be said that the method itself is wrong. In his speech, Mr. Hu Feng did not sincerely criticize the shortcomings and errors of the correspondent work in order to improve the work and give play to the role of the correspondents, but rather slandered and abused. He said that the "Literary Gazette Correspondent Internal Bulletin" is an "underground publication" with "serious" and "secret" tasks, and said that "if a correspondent raises an opposing opinion, the lighter punishment is to criticize his ideology as problematic, and the heavier punishment is to cancel his correspondent status and expel him from the 'membership'." This is not criticism, this is insulting the "Literary Gazette" and all its correspondents, indiscriminately calling all correspondents "slaves"!

Yes, there are problems and many errors in the "Literary Gazette"'s correspondent work. These errors should naturally be examined and should be subject to criticism. However, is all the correspondent work as bad as Mr. Hu Feng said?

I became a correspondent for the "Literary Gazette" in 1950. Up to now, the editorial department of the "Literary Gazette" has sent me as many as seventy-nine letters. These are not "issuing orders" to me by the editorial department, but normal contacts, answering my questions, such as life problems, opera creation problems, how to understand life problems, etc. Some letters are as long as three or four thousand words. Although there are inevitably some erroneous theories in these letters, I cannot write off the help and education the editorial department has given me, and I still sincerely thank them. As for the "underground publication" mentioned by Mr. Hu Feng, it is not a "serious" "secret" either. Up to now, this publication has been published for thirty-six issues. The main content is to help correspondents study (such as publishing Polevoy's "Five Seas Navigation," Comrade Xi Zhongxun's "Opinions on Film Work," Comrade Kalinin's "On the Writing and Cultivation of Correspondents," Comrade Hu Qiaomu's speech on "The Organizational Tasks of Literary and Art Groups in Our Country to Strive for the Prosperity of Literature and Art," Comrade Li Fuchun's speech at the Beijing Literary and Art Workers Symposium, etc.), problem discussions (such as the discussion of "How to Discover New Problems," the discussion of "How to Be a Good Correspondent," etc.), and experience exchange (such as publishing correspondents' letters and exchanging work experience with each other, etc.). There are criticisms and self-criticisms in the publication, as well as opinions of correspondents on the editorial department (here I would like to explain that the "Literary Gazette" also lacks the spirit of self-criticism in this publication). Have all these comrades who made suggestions to the editorial department been expelled from their "membership"? No, I am one of them.

So, why is Mr. Hu Feng particularly dissatisfied and hostile to the correspondent work in his speech? The secret may be here:

Two letters opposing Mr. Hu Feng's literary and artistic theory were published in the fifteenth issue of this "underground publication," and the editorial department also added an editor's note, which is why it aroused Mr. Hu Feng's excitement and anger!

We know that Mr. Hu Feng's erroneous theory has a great influence on young people: they are content with their original narrow life, emptyly pursuing what "vitality" is, emphasizing and exaggerating the role of "subjective fighting spirit," and using this to replace the actual struggle of going deep into the life of the masses. Are these idealist views not allowed to be opposed by correspondents? Can correspondents and the vast number of young people give up the struggle?

Yes, the editorial department's editor's note once said: "We hope that these two letters can attract the attention and study of all correspondent comrades... Tell us in detail your own understanding and interpretation, as well as the process of reading Hu Feng's literary and artistic theory." Is this call wrong? It turns out that what Mr. Hu Feng refers to as "issuing orders" and "attacking someone" is this!

Dear readers, do not think that Mr. Hu Feng's speech is just "excitement." The slander and abuse of the correspondent work is actually to complain for himself, to cover up his own erroneous literary and artistic theory, and to attempt to further promote it, so that it can raise its head again and continue to poison young people. His defense of A Long is essentially a defense of himself, although he did not mention a word about the "Literary Gazette"'s criticism of him in his speech. But this is very obvious.

This rude and sinister attitude is opposed to Marxism and the Party's literary and artistic cause. This speech is not a well-intentioned help for the "Literary Gazette" to improve its work, but a malicious attack, attempting to replace Marxist literary and artistic theory with his fallacies. He said at the end, "I am very sad," but in essence, he is gloating.

Please, Mr. Hu Feng, do not doubt that this article was not written at the request of anyone, nor is it to defend the "Literary Gazette" and its correspondent work (their mistakes will be criticized by someone). It is because I am one of the "close friends" of the "Literary Gazette." If I do not write, readers will not understand this "serious" "secret."

Readers, we have raised our weapons against bourgeois ideology and are fiercely fighting. But, you have to be careful, someone is stabbing us in the leg!

We Must Be Vigilant

Sun Xi and Jiang Yin from the Zhangjiakou Federation of Literary and Art Circles submitted an article titled "We Must Be Vigilant," with the following summary: We two have been consciously and unconsciously influenced by Mr. Hu Feng's literary and artistic views in the past. After reading Mr. Hu Feng's speech at the enlarged joint meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the China Writers Association this time, we feel it is necessary to express our opinions on his speech.

Mr. Hu Feng's speech gives us a prominent feeling that he is not cutting out the appendix, but launching an attack on the entire literary and artistic front with random arrows.

Mr. Hu Feng said: "After the 'Literary Gazette' problem occurred, my personal mood was heavy. Because, in any case, this is a failure on our front. The failure is shared by all of us, so the mood is very heavy. Some comrades said that my last speech was very excited. Yes, I was very excited. This came from a sense of failure. I was not able to control myself." How cleverly these words slander our cause! If we all fall into the quagmire of this "sense of failure" like Mr. Hu Feng, who can fight against the decadent ideas of the bourgeoisie!

Everyone believes that this ideological struggle is another serious struggle against bourgeois ideology after "The Life of Wu Xun," and at the same time, it is also a struggle against the shameful capitulationism of bourgeois ideology. The Party is leading this ideological struggle. Therefore, we believe that the result of this struggle will inevitably be a major victory for Marxism on the ideological front. We will never fail. Admittedly, we will sometimes encounter setbacks and make mistakes in the course of progress, but we will not fall into a "sense of failure."

The criticism of "The Life of Wu Xun" and the criticism of Hu Shi's ideology were all ideological struggles of great significance led by the Party. There is only one goal of the struggle: to oppose the bourgeois idealism. The facts of the past few years have proved that our front is constantly expanding, and new forces are growing rapidly. Mr. Hu Feng is unwilling to honestly admit this, and groundlessly spreads the mood of failure. What "failure on the front," his mood is very "heavy," and so on. There have been such people in history. When we have a little victory, he will say: we have won everything, everything is fine; when we have shortcomings and errors, he will say: we have all failed, we are not good. We are unwilling to put the person who existed in history and Mr. Hu Feng who lives in reality together, but we believe that Mr. Hu Feng's speech has his personal purpose. He wants to take this opportunity to weaken the combat effectiveness of our front and sell his bourgeois literary and artistic thought. Let everyone be shrouded in the mood of failure. During this time, he quietly erected the banner of his "subjective fighting spirit."

From Mr. Hu Feng's speech, we see Mr. Hu Feng's two-faced attitude. He is attacking some comrades and wooing some people. We never naively believe that Mr. Hu Feng's speech was only caused by excitement, resulting in linguistic problems. On the contrary, we believe that he is a person who has always been waving the banner of Marxism, but standing on the anti-Marxist position. Therefore, his words are easy to confuse some people, and some people have really been fooled. In his speech, he said: "After Comrade Xuefeng's speech last time, I was very sad. Why? One of our old comrades failed in his work, at least at least, he failed in this work. We don't have many old comrades. Seeing the failure of the old comrades, I am very sad." Since he sympathizes with the old comrades so much and is sad for the "failure" of the old comrades, why take the opportunity to criticize the "Literary Gazette" and launch a vicious attack on the entire literary and artistic cause? It turns out that Mr. Hu Feng believes that he can do more things to attack and slander in the face of the people's cause, and he can take a hypocritical sympathetic attitude in the face of individuals.

Let's take a look at Mr. Hu Feng's attitude towards Mr. A Long!

Mr. Hu Feng said: "A Long and I are familiar friends, but since this problem is within the scope of the material and is a prominent example, I cannot avoid mentioning it because of this. Otherwise, that is not only a vulgar idea, but also does not believe in the task of today's ideological struggle. Similarly, I cannot but mention the related person Comrade Yuan Shuipai." Mr. Hu Feng issued a hypocritical call in the fierce ideological struggle. He called on the Party and the people to give Mr. A Long "a breather." At the same time, he asked us to take off the "spy" hat worn by Mr. A Long. (Who put the "spy" hat on Mr. A Long?) Obviously, this is Mr. Hu Feng's "noble emotion." The matter is very clear. This is Mr. Hu Feng's attempt to take the opportunity to infuse his bourgeois literary and artistic thought into the people's literary and artistic field, and to revive his theory of "subjective fighting spirit." We tell Mr. Hu Feng that if Mr. Hu Feng charges the people with the soul of "subjective fighting spirit," he is bound to fail.

Why did Mr. Hu Feng stand up to defend Mr. A Long, who had distorted Marxism, while the struggle against Hu Shi's bourgeois ideology was underway? The problem is very obvious. It is his bourgeois idealist literary and artistic viewpoint at work, hostile to the proletariat's literary and artistic cause, exaggerating the shortcomings and errors in our progress into the failure of the front, so as to achieve his personal goals.

We advocate free discussion, but we will never allow those who use "free discussion" as a pretext to promote the decadent and reactionary views of the bourgeoisie. Lenin said: "We are talking about Party literature and its subordination to Party supervision. Everyone is free to write whatever he wants to write and say whatever he wants to say, without the slightest restriction. But every free association (including the Party) is equally free to expel members who use the Party's signboard to promote anti-Party views." (Lenin: "Party Organization and Party Literature")

Mr. Hu Feng was even more excited and angry when he mentioned the "Literary Gazette Correspondent Internal Bulletin." He said that the "internal bulletin" is an "underground publication," and that the mission of this "internal bulletin" has a "serious secret mission." This is not a well-intentioned help for the "Literary Gazette" to improve its work, but a malicious slander. Why can't a publication call on its correspondents to participate in the struggle to criticize erroneous ideas? The mistake of the "Literary Gazette" is precisely that it did not organize its correspondents and readers well to carry out this struggle. Why is this a "secret" mission? Is this something that cannot be disclosed? I think the reason why Mr. Hu Feng is so annoyed by this matter is precisely because he himself has a secret that cannot be disclosed: fear of being criticized by others.

Of course, the "Literary Gazette" has errors and shortcomings in its work with correspondents, but it is definitely not what Mr. Hu Feng said. We hope that the "Literary Gazette" can correct its errors and shortcomings.

The problem of the "internal bulletin" has led to the problem of the attitude towards young people. Mr. Hu Feng used the method of throwing a "returning carbine" in an attempt to win over young people and hit us. He said: "The young comrades of the editorial department (referring to the editorial department of the 'Literary Gazette') were very enthusiastic at the beginning, and they asked to work for the revolution. They asked to be educated and trained in their work, but due to the ideology and style of the leaders, these comrades gradually fell into such a working environment and work style. Can these young comrades be blamed? They believe in the leaders, put in hard work, and spent their precious youth, but the result of the work is such a result that they could not imagine. Don't our leaders have to be responsible?" If we young comrades are so easily misled, we will stand on Mr. Hu Feng's side and attack our leaders and our Party. However, new forces are growing up under the care of the Party, not in Mr. Hu Feng's hypocritical "sympathy." Can't we recognize who is a hypocrite? Mr. Hu Feng will not achieve his personal goals.

In the struggle, on the one hand, we must seriously examine our own shortcomings and errors, but on the other hand, we should be vigilant against those who want to take the opportunity to rob!

### 对胡风在文联和作协主席团扩大联席会议上的发言的意见

1955-01-14

专栏：

    对胡风在文联和作协主席团扩大联席会议上的发言的意见
    一个“文艺报”通讯员的意见
    大连读者叶德浴来稿——“一个‘文艺报’通讯员的意见”中说：胡风先生在中国文联主席团和中国作家协会主席团扩大联席会议上的发言中，对“文艺报”的通讯员工作表示了极大的愤慨和不满。胡风先生认为，“文艺报”印发给通讯员的“内部通报”是一个“地下刊物”。作为“文艺报”的读者和通讯员的我，不能不就这件事说几句话。
    就我所知，组织通讯员网并印发内部刊物的报刊不只是“文艺报”一个，不少报刊采取着同样的措施来教育、培养通讯员的。为什么胡风先生独独对“文艺报”的这一措施表示了如此狂热的仇恨呢？胡风先生自己已经透露了原因了。他说：“在这个‘内部通报’里面向通讯员发号施令，要批评、打击什么人，就在那上面发出号召，要求通讯员写信，开座谈会，写文章，造成‘群众基础’。”
    这里虽然没有直截地说出“有的通讯员”“由于不满”寄给他看的那期“内部通报”的内容，但意思是很明白的，“文艺报通讯员内部通报”曾经号召通讯员对胡风先生的文艺思想展开批判。照胡风先生的说法，这就是“文艺报”对他进行“打击”的号召。
    “文艺报”曾经对胡风先生的反马克思主义文艺思想进行了批判，这是完全必要的、正确的。
    大家知道，胡风先生的文艺思想曾在一部分小资产阶级知识分子中发生过不小的不良影响。在抗战期间，以胡风先生为首的那个文艺小集团，披着马克思主义的外衣，狂热地鼓吹着非无产阶级的文艺思想。他们歌颂“原始的生命力”和个人主义，片面夸大“主观战斗精神”的作用，以个人的反抗代替阶级斗争。胡风先生并宣扬了“哪里有生活，哪里就有斗争”的理论，引导了当时的一部分缺乏勇气投身到群众的斗争中去的小资产阶级知识分子走上一条与毛泽东文艺思想根本相对立的路上去。胡风先生的文艺思想，正是资产阶级个人主义思想和反动的唯心论观点在文艺理论上的反映。这种文艺思想反映在创作上，突出地表现在当时路翎的一连串的作品中。路翎笔下的工人、农民大多具有浓厚的个人主义思想和无政府主义思想，具有流氓无产阶级的作风。路翎的八十万字的长篇小说“财主的儿女们”，被胡风先生誉为“中国新文学史上一个重大的事件”，书中的人物就几乎都是些不可理解的、歇斯底里的人。胡风先生的文艺思想到今天还严重地影响着有些作家的理论批评和创作。
    由于同毛主席的文艺思想相对抗，在相当长的一个时期内，胡风先生和在他影响下的一些人们的笔锋主要不是针对敌人，他们肆意攻击、排斥、讥笑、诬蔑凡是他们看起来不顺眼、不跟着他们跑的进步文艺界的作家的作品，乃至攻击党对文艺工作的领导。
    以胡风先生为首的这种错误的文艺思想，以及宗派主义的情绪，一直到解放后并没有什么改变，在某些方面，倒反是发展得更其不能令人容忍了。为了坚持文艺领域中工人阶级思想的领导地位，为了树立和巩固马克思主义文艺思想，一九五二、一九五三年文艺界对胡风先生的资产阶级文艺思想进行批判，以廓清这一思想给予部分读者的坏影响，是完全必要的。
    没有隐瞒的必要，我曾经长期地作为胡风先生的盲目崇拜者的一个普通读者，是从那次斗争中认识到了胡风先生的文艺思想的错误以及它对自己进步的危害的。
    在党的领导下，“文艺报”为了更彻底地清除胡风先生的文艺思想在部分读者中的影响，为了更有效地使胡风先生能够认识自己的错误，在“文艺报通讯员内部通报”上要求通讯员积极参加这一思想斗争，这正是“文艺报”责无旁贷地应担负的严肃的思想斗争任务。这一思想批判的展开是符合广大读者的要求的。
    “文艺报”在通讯员的工作上的确存在着很多缺点和错误，在“文艺报通讯员内部通报”中有时也刊载了一些有严重错误的文字。这是和“文艺报”编辑部的整个工作中的缺点、错误相联系的。但决不能由此得出结论说，“文艺报”在一九五二年号召通讯员积极参加胡风文艺思想批判的行动也是错误的。
    胡风先生如果真正从人民的利益出发，对党对
  “文艺报”的批评应当表示欢迎。如果胡风先生对不少同志的意见能认真地加以思考，是应该认识自己的错误，以及这些错误的危害性的。然而，从胡风这次的发言看，他对自己的错误还是十分缺乏认识。不然，是不会把对于自己的错误思想的批判理解为“打击什么人”的。
    胡风先生所以认为一九五二年对他的文艺思想的批判是“打击什么人”，这是有历史根源的。舒芜在“致路翎的公开信”（“文艺报”一九五二年第十八号）中揭露他们当时的恶劣的宗派主义情绪和活动时曾经指出：“我们更以小资产阶级的腐臭庸俗的眼光，向后看而不是向前看，以己之心，度人之腹，念念不忘并津津有味于文艺运动历史上的某些‘掌故’，用了鲁迅所说的‘后街老虔婆’式的方法，把延安文艺座谈会以后解放区的整个的伟大的人民文艺运动，都解释成某几位领导同志用以打击某一个人的花样。这样，在文艺工作上，就好像无所谓原则，无所谓党的领导，只有混乱一团的私人恩怨纠缠；而党的文艺工作里面，也好像无所谓原则，无所谓组织，无所谓组织领导，可以任由一两个人随便胡来，假公谊以报私仇，居然风动全国，而竟没有人过问。只有我们那个小集团，才是‘为坚持原则而斗争’，才是唯一的光明，中流的砥柱。”（着重号是引者加的）舒芜的话是针对十年前的情况说的，可惜的是，胡风先生在这次发言中表现的基本的情绪也还是同样的东西。十分明白，胡风先生的发言实质上已经不仅是对“文艺报”的攻击了。
    把秘密公开了吧
    西安西北人民歌舞剧团李晓白投来题为“把秘密公开了吧”一稿，内容摘要如下：
      “文艺报”一九五四年二十二号发表了刘白羽等同志的发言，我们十分欢迎。这不但有助于“文艺报”检查工作，对广大读者也有教育意义。在这些发言中，有一个共同点，就是希望“文艺报”立即改正错误，名符其实地成为文艺战线上的具有指导性、战斗性的刊物。这些发言是严厉的、尖锐的，然而却是诚恳的。他们是以加强党的文艺事业为出发点，以打垮资产阶级思想为目的。
    但是，我对胡风先生的发言，十分不满，简直使人不能容忍！自然，胡风先生的发言，有它正确的地方，但是，这长近两万字的发言，实质是胡风先生假着批评“文艺报”来宣扬自己的错误的文艺理论，并竭力为阿垅先生的“在文艺创造中为其他阶级来与工农阶级争‘主角的资格’”（周扬：“我们必须战斗”）的反马克思主义文艺理论的错误论调做辩护士。胡风先生究竟是为维护党的文艺事业而批评和帮助“文艺报”改进工作呢，还是敌对党的文艺事业而在攻击“文艺报”呢？在我的理解，他的出发点是后者。
    他的错误观点，周扬同志在“我们必须战斗”一文中及袁水拍同志在他的发言中，已经替大家说话了，我们衷心拥护这两个发言。现在，我就胡风先生对“文艺报”通讯工作的批评，发表我的意见，以此说明胡风先生对党的文艺事业的态度及其发言的内幕。
    “文艺报”是全国文联的机关刊物。它需要了解全国各地的文艺创作活动。这是无可非议的。既然如此，组织通讯员是解决这个问题的一种方法。运用这种方法，并无不可。在运用这种方法的具体工作中，有了错误，那是另一个问题，绝不能说这种方法本身是错误的。而胡风先生在他的发言中，不是诚心诚意地批评通讯工作的缺点和错误，从而改进工作，发挥通讯员的作用，而是诽谤、谩骂。他说“文艺报通讯员内部通报”是“地下刊物”，负有“严重”的“秘密”任务，说“如果通讯员提出了反对的意见，轻的是批评他的思想有问题，重的是取消他的通讯员资格，开除他的‘员’籍”。这不是批评，这是侮辱“文艺报”及其全体通讯员，把全体通讯员不分青红皂白一概说成“奴隶”了！
    是的，“文艺报”的通讯工作，是存在问题的，错误不少。这些错误自然应该进行检查，应该受到指责。然而，全部通讯工作是不是像胡风先生说的那样恶劣呢？
    我是一九五○年成为“文艺报”通讯员的。到现在为止，“文艺报”编辑部给我的信件即有七十九封之多。这里边不是编辑部给我“发号施令”，而是正常的联系，给我解答问题，如生活问题、歌剧创作问题、如何认识生活问题等等。有的信竟达三两千字之多。虽然这里边难免有些错误的理论，但我不能一笔勾销编辑部对我的帮助和教育，到现在我还要真诚地感谢他们。至于胡风先生说的“地下刊物”，也并不是什么“严重”的“秘密”。到现在为止，这刊物出了三十六期，这中间主要的内容是帮助通讯员学习（如刊出的有：波列沃伊的“五海通航”、习仲勋同志的“对于电影工作的意见”、加里宁同志的“论通讯员的写作和修养”、胡乔木同志的“关于文学艺术团体为争取我国文学艺术的繁荣的组织任务”的演讲、李富春同志在北京文艺工作者座谈会上的讲话等等），是问题讨论（如“怎样发现新问题”的讨论、“怎样做好一个通讯员”的讨论等等），是经验交流（如发表通讯来信，互相交流工作经验等等）。刊物里有批评，也有自我批评，更有通讯员对编辑部的意见（这里说明一下，“文艺报”在这个刊物上同样缺乏自我批评的精神）。难道这些给编辑部提意见的同志都被开除了“员”籍了吗？没有的，我就是其中的一个。
    那么，胡风先生为什么在发言中特别不满和仇视通讯工作呢？秘密可能是在这里：
    这个“地下刊物”十五号上，发表了两封反对胡风先生的文艺理论的来信，编辑部还加了按语，所以才引起了胡风先生的激动和愤怒吧！
    我们知道，胡风先生的错误理论，对青年人的影响是很大的：他们安于原有的狭隘的生活，空洞地追求什么“生命力”，强调和夸大“主观战斗精神”的作用，并以此代替了深入群众生活的实际斗争。这些唯心论观点，难道不许通讯员反对吗？难道通讯员和广大的青年群众可以放弃斗争吗？
    是的，编辑部的按语曾说：“希望这两封信能引起所有通讯员同志的注意和研究……详细地把自己的认识和理解，以及阅读胡风文艺理论的过程告诉我们。”难道这个号召是错误的？原来胡风先生所指的“发号施令”、“打击什么人”就是这个！
    亲爱的读者，不要以为胡风先生的发言只是“激动”而已，对通讯工作的诽谤、谩骂，实则是为他自己抱不平，借以掩护自己错误的文艺理论，企图进一步宣扬它，使它重新抬头，继续毒害青年。他给阿垅做辩护士实质上是为自己做辩护士，虽然在发言中没有提到一句关于“文艺报”批评他的问题。但这却是很明显的。
    这种粗暴而阴险的态度，和马克思主义及党的文艺事业是对立的。这发言不是善意帮助“文艺报”改进工作，而是恶意攻击，企图以他的谬论代替马克思主义的文艺理论。他最后说“我是很难过的”，而实质上是幸灾乐祸。
    请胡风先生不要怀疑，这篇文章不是任何人约我写的，也绝不是为“文艺报”及其通讯工作做辩护（它们的错误是会有人批评的），实因我就是
  “文艺报”的“亲信”之一。我如不写，这“严重”的“秘密”读者是不会了解的。
    读者们，我们向资产阶级思想已举起了武器，正在激烈地战斗着。但是，你要小心，有人在我们的腿上戳一刀！
    我们必须警惕
    张家口市文联孙曦、江音来稿，题为“我们必须警惕”，内容摘要如下：我们两个在过去曾自觉和不自觉地受过胡风先生文艺观点的影响。这次我们看了胡风先生在中国文学艺术界联合会主席团和中国作家协会主席团扩大联席会议上的发言，我们觉得有必要提出我们对他发言的意见。
    胡风先生的发言，给我们一个突出的感觉，他不是在割盲肠，而是向整个文艺战线乱箭四射地发起了进攻。
    胡风先生说：“‘文艺报’的问题发生以后，我个人的心情是沉重的。因为，无论如何，这是我们战线上的失败。失败是我们大家共同的，所以心情很沉重。有的同志说我上次发言很激动，是的，我是很激动的，这是从失败感来的，我没有能够控制自己。”这些话是多么巧妙地对我们的事业给予无情的中伤！要是我们都像胡风先生那样陷入这种
  “失败感”的泥坑里去，有谁还能向资产阶级的腐朽思想进行斗争呢！
    谁都认为，这次思想斗争是继“武训传”以后又一次反对资产阶级思想的严重斗争，同时，也是反对对资产阶级思想的可耻的投降主义的斗争。党领导着这场思想斗争。因此，我们相信，这场斗争的结果，必然是马克思主义在思想战线上的一大胜利。我们决不会失败。诚然，在前进中有时会遇到挫折和产生错误，但是我们不会掉进“失败感”里去的。
    “武训传”的批判和对胡适派思想的批判，都是党领导的具有重大意义的思想斗争。斗争的目标只有一个：反对资产阶级的唯心论。几年来的事实证明，我们的战线在不断扩大，新生力量在迅速成长。胡风先生却不愿老实地承认这个，无凭无据地散布失败情绪。说什么“战线上的失败”，他的心情很“沉重”等等。历史上有过这样的人，当我们有一点儿胜利的时候，他就说：我们一切都胜利了，万事大吉了；当我们有了缺点和错误的时候，他就会说：我们全部都失败了，我们不行了。我们不愿意把这种在历史上存在的人和在现实中生活的胡风先生拉在一起，但，我们认为胡风先生的发言是怀着他个人的目的的。他是想借着这个机会削弱我们战线的战斗力，贩卖他的资产阶级文艺思想。让每个人都被失败情绪所笼罩着，在这当儿他便悄悄地树起他的“主观战斗精神”的旗帜。
    从胡风先生的发言中，我们看到胡风先生的两面态度。他是在打击一些同志和拉拢一些人。我们决不天真地认为胡风先生的发言仅仅是由于激动而造成了语句上的毛病。相反，我们认为他是一贯打着马克思主义的旗子，而站在反马克思主义的立场上的人。因此，他的话很容易迷惑一些人，也有些人真的就上了当。他在发言中说：“上次雪峰同志发言以后，我是很难过的。为什么？我们有一位老同志在工作上失败了，至少至少是，在这个工作上是失败了。我们老同志不多，看到老同志失败，我是很难过的。”既然这样同情老同志，为老同志的“失败”难过，那么为什么要借批评“文艺报”的机会，而对整个文艺事业作恶毒的进攻呢？原来胡风先生认为在人民的事业面前可以多做些打击和诽谤的事，在个人面前可以采取虚伪的同情态度。
    再看看胡风对阿垅先生的态度吧！
    胡风先生说：“阿垅和我是熟识的朋友，但既然这问题在材料范围之内，又是一个凸出的例子，我不能因为这就回避开不提。否则，那不但是庸俗的想法，而且是不相信今天的思想斗争任务的。同样，也就不能不提到关系人袁水拍同志。”胡风先生在激烈的思想斗争中，发出了虚伪的呼声，他呼吁党和人民给阿垅先生“缓口气儿”。同时，要求我们把阿垅先生头上戴的“特务”帽子摘下来。（是谁给阿垅先生戴的“特务”帽子呢？）很显然，这就是胡风先生的“高尚的情感”。事情很明白，这是胡风先生想乘机把自己的资产阶级文艺思想向人民的文艺领域中灌输，想让他的“主观战斗精神”的论调复活。我们告诉胡风先生，如果胡风先生带着“主观战斗精神”的灵魂向人民冲锋陷阵，他是一定要失败的。
    为什么正在对胡适的资产阶级思想进行斗争时，胡风先生却挺身而出，为曾经歪曲过马克思主义的阿垅先生辩护呢？问题很明显，这是他的资产阶级唯心论的文艺观点在作怪，敌视无产阶级的文艺事业，将我们前进中的缺点和错误夸大成战线的失败，借以达到他个人的目的。
    我们是主张自由讨论的，但是，我们绝不允许那些假借“自由讨论”来宣扬资产阶级的腐朽的反动观点。列宁说过：“我们说的是党的文学及其对于党的监督之服从。每个人都有自由写他所愿意写的和说他所愿意说的一切，没有丝毫的限制。但是每个自由的结社（党也包括在内）同样也有自由赶走利用党的招牌来鼓吹反党的观点的成员。”（列宁著：“党的组织和党的文学”）
    胡风先生在提到“文艺报通讯员内部通报”时，是更激昂更气愤了。他说：“内部通报”是“地下刊物”，并且说这个“内部通报”的使命是有着“严重的秘密任务”的。这不是对“文艺报”改进工作的善意帮助，而是恶毒的污蔑。为什么一个刊物不能号召它的通讯员参加批判错误思想的斗争呢？“文艺报”的错误恰恰是没有很好地组织它的通讯员和读者来进行这种斗争。为什么这就是“秘密”的任务呢？难道这是什么不可告人的事情吗？我看胡风先生所以对这件事这样恼恨，正是由于他自己有一种不可告人的秘密：害怕别人批评他。
    当然，“文艺报”在通讯员工作上是有错误和缺点的，但决不是像胡风先生所说的那些。我们希望“文艺报”能纠正自己的错误和缺点。
    由“内部通报”的问题引起了对青年人的态度问题。胡风先生使用摔“回马枪”的方法企图拉拢青年，想打中我们。他说：“编辑部（指‘文艺报’编辑部）的青年同志们一开始都热情很高，要求为革命工作，他们是要求在工作中得到教育，受到锻炼的，但由于领导上的思想和作风，这些同志逐渐落到了这样一个工作环境和工作作风里面去了。难道可以怪这些青年同志们吗？他们相信领导，付出了辛勤的劳动，用去了宝贵的青春，但工作底结果却是这么一种他们没有能力想像到的结果，难道不要我们领导上负责吗？”要是我们青年同志都是那样容易被迷惑的话，就会站到胡风的一边，向我们的领导和我们的党进攻了。但是，新生力量是在党的关怀下成长的，而不是在胡风先生虚伪的“同情”中成长的。难道我们认不清谁是伪善者吗？胡风先生是达不到他个人的目的的。
    在斗争中我们一方面要严正地检查自己的缺点和错误，但另一方面我们应该警惕着那些想趁机打劫的人！
