Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The Ministry of Water Resources of the People's Republic of China convened the 1955 National Water Conservancy Conference in Beijing from January 4th to 17th. The conference examined the problems discovered in the 1954 water conservancy projects in the Yangtze River, Huai River, and parts of the North China region during the extraordinary floods, and studied the requirements of the new developments in national economic construction and the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement on water conservancy work. The conference believes that in the future, it is necessary to actively start with basin planning, adopt a policy of combining temporary and permanent solutions, and emphasizing both flood control and drainage, to continue to manage rivers that cause serious harm; at the same time, actively develop farmland water conservancy to gradually reduce various drought and flood disasters and ensure the growth of agricultural production.

According to this basic spirit, the conference decided that the main tasks of river management and flood control in 1955 are: vigorously carrying out the preparation of basin plans for the Yangtze River, Han River, Huai River, North China Hai River system, Pearl River, Liao River, Xinjiang Manas River, Urumqi River, and major tributaries of the Yellow River such as the Fen River, Yi River, Luo River, and Qin River; actively preparing the design data for the fundamental Yellow River management project, the surveying and mapping work for the first phase of the Yellow River irrigation project, and the soil and water conservation work in the Loess Plateau area; before the completion of the Sanmenxia Reservoir, the largest hydropower and water conservancy hub in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, temporary flood control projects should be added to the lower reaches of the Yellow River to prevent abnormal floods; in the Huai River basin, a number of projects will continue to be built, such as the Meishan Reservoir, Nanwan Reservoir, the newly built entrance to the Yangtze River waterway, and the irrigation experimental area in the lower reaches of the Huai River; in the Yangtze River basin, the Han River flood diversion project, and the Honghu and Huayang River flood storage and reclamation projects will begin; in the Liao River basin, the Dahuofang Reservoir project will continue. In North China and other regions, some projects will also be continued or newly started. The conference believes that due to the large amount of work left over from blocking breaches and restoring embankments after last year's extraordinary floods, and because of the heavy snow in winter, many projects have been moved to this year for construction, so this year's work will be very tight, and all localities must strengthen leadership.

The conference also determined the tasks for developing farmland water conservancy in 1955. In order to meet the needs of agricultural production increase, especially the increase in grain and cotton production, it is planned to expand the irrigated area by 14 million mu this year. The conference especially urged all localities to attach importance to soil and water conservation work. Among them, the areas with serious soil erosion in the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River and the upper reaches of the Yongding River are the key areas for national soil and water conservation, and each county is required to complete 40 to 60 square kilometers.

During the conference, representatives from various regions also conducted separate studies on this year's flood control work and surveying, design, and planning management.

    水利部召开今年全国水利会议
    【新华社十八日讯】中华人民共和国水利部从一月四日到十七日在北京召开了一九五五年全国水利会议。会议检查了一九五四年长江、淮河流域和华北部分地区的水利工程在特大洪水情况下所发现的问题，研究了国家经济建设和农业互助合作运动的新发展对水利工作的要求。会议认为今后必须积极从流域规划入手，采取治标治本结合、防洪排涝并重的方针，继续治理为害严重的河流；同时积极兴办农田水利，以逐渐减免各种水旱灾害，保证农业生产的增长。
    根据这一基本精神，会议决定一九五五年治河防洪方面的主要工作为：大力进行长江、汉水、淮河、华北海河水系、珠江、辽河、新疆玛纳斯河、乌鲁木齐河和黄河主要支流汾河、伊河、洛河、沁河等河流流域规划的编制工作；积极准备黄河治本工程的设计资料，黄河第一期灌溉工程的勘测工作和黄土高原地区的水土保持工作；在黄河中游最大水力水利枢纽三门峡水库完成前，为防止异常洪水袭击，黄河下游还要增修临时防洪工程；淮河流域要继续兴修梅山水库、南湾水库、新办入江水道和淮河下游灌溉试验区等多项工程；长江流域要开始兴修汉水分洪工程，洪湖、华阳河蓄洪垦殖工程；辽河流域将继续进行大伙房水库工程。华北和其他各地，也将续办、新办一些工程。会议认为：由于去年特大洪水后所留堵口复堤的工作量很大，又因冬季雪大，许多工程移到今年施工，因而今年的工作将很紧张，各地必须抓紧领导。
    会议还确定了一九五五年发展农田水利的任务。为满足农业增产特别是粮食、棉花增产的需要，今年计划扩大灌溉面积一千四百万亩。会议特别要求各地重视水土保持工作。其中以黄河上、中游和永定河上游水土流失严重地区为全国重点举办水土保持的地区，每县要求完成四十平方公里到六十平方公里。
    会议期间，各地代表对今年防汛工作和勘测设计、计划管理等项工作也分别做了研究。
