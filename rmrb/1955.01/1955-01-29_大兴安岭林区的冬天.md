    Winter in the Greater Khingan Mountains Forest Area
    Zhao Xiang

    Amidst the swirling snow, the Greater Khingan Mountains forest area has begun its winter production – timber hauling operations. The usual temperature here is minus thirty to forty-five degrees Celsius; sometimes, chilling winds from Siberia blow in.

    The harsh winter is the "golden age" of forestry production. Seventy percent of the timber from the Greater Khingan Mountains forest area is transported out of the forest during this time of year. Since last winter, tens of thousands of workers in the Greater Khingan Mountains forest have been working diligently in the bitter cold to support the country's socialist construction.

    On artificially irrigated ice roads, powerful Stalin 80 tractors haul long trains of sleds loaded with timber, heading from the mountain log yards to the timber distribution center – the storage yard. There are more than fifty Stalin 80 tractors participating in this winter transport. Many newly purchased Czech-made "Tatra" ten-ton trucks, fully loaded with timber, speed along the highways and snow-covered roads alongside other vehicles. Drivers meeting on the road greet each other with, "How many trips have you made? How many more are you doing?"

    Among the tractor drivers, there are three female drivers. In the harsh climate of the Greater Khingan Mountains, they perform their tasks just like their male counterparts. Their faces are red with cold, and their hands are chapped. Sometimes, when the tractor has a minor breakdown, they crawl under the tractor, lying on the ice road, or burrow into the engine to make minor repairs. They never complain, saying: We must resolutely complete the task and cannot give up halfway! The drivers and assistants of the Czech-made "Tatra" ten-ton trucks are mostly recent high school graduates who have responded to the country's call to participate in forestry production.

    One after another, horse-drawn sleds busily haul timber from the logging sites that have completed their work to the mountain log yards. The owners of these horse-drawn sleds are mostly nearby farmers and herders. They drive their horses to the forest area and have put forward a resounding slogan: "We won't go home until we help the country complete its task!"

  　The various storage yards are filled with a busy scene. Tractors, trucks, and horse-drawn sleds transporting timber arrive one after another. The amount of new timber in the storage yards increases day by day. Scalers and bookkeepers are extremely busy, constantly shouting: "Four meters, eight meters!" "Mine props, utility poles!" From morning till night, the sound of machines, the neighing of horses, and the shouts of people never cease in the storage yards.

    Every storage yard has a railway line that leads to all parts of the country. Every day, ten or so empty cars are shunted in, and large cranes use their huge claws to grab the timber and load it onto the cars. Day and night, long trains loaded with timber depart from the Greater Khingan Mountains forest area to all parts of the country, to support the country's construction in mines, construction sites, and new railway lines.

    At dusk, the sound of the last tractor stops. How warm it is for the tired people who have been frozen all day to enter their houses and work sheds and take off their cotton hats and coats! After dinner, under the lamplight, people play cards, read books, sing songs, chat, and sometimes hold meetings to discuss work. Some sit down to write letters to their families and friends, reporting on the intense battle and joyful life in the Greater Khingan Mountains forest in winter.

    大兴安岭林区的冬天
    朝襄
    在大雪纷飞中，大兴安岭林区开始了冬季生产——木材运搬作业。这里通常的温度是零下三十至四十五度；有时候还要刮起来自西伯利亚的寒风。
    严寒的冬季是林业生产的“黄金时代”，一年里，大兴安岭林区有百分之七十的木材要在这时从林中运出来。从去年冬季开始，有成千上万的工人，在大兴安岭森林里，冒着严寒，为支援国家社会主义建设辛勤的劳动着。
    在人工浇灌的冰道上，威力强大的斯大林八十号拖拉机，牵引着长长一列满载木材的爬犁，由山中楞场驶往木材集散地——贮木场。参加这次冬运的斯大林八十号拖拉机一共有五十多台。新买的许多台捷克式“塔吐拉”十吨载重汽车，满装着木材，和别的汽车一起，在公路上、雪道上疾驶着。驾驶员们在半路上相遇，头句话都是：“干了几趟？还干几趟呀？”
    在拖拉机驾驶员当中，有三个女驾驶员。在大兴安岭严寒的气候里，她们和男同志们一样执行着任务。她们的脸冻得通红，手冻得都裂了口子。有时拖拉机出了小故障，她们就爬到拖拉机底下，躺在冰道上，或钻到马达里，进行小修。她们从来没有叫过苦，她们说：只能坚决完成任务，不能中途罢休！捷克式“塔吐拉”十吨载重汽车的驾驶员和助手，大部分是新从学校里出来的高小毕业生，他们响应国家的号召，参加了林业生产。
    一辆一辆的马套子，繁忙地从结束作业的伐木场往山中楞场上拉木材。这些马套子的主人，多半是附近的农民和牧民。他们赶着自己的马匹来到林区，并且提出了响亮的口号：“不帮助国家完成任务不回家！”
  　各个贮木场上充满着一片忙碌的景象。运木材的拖拉机、汽车、马套子，陆陆续续的到来。贮木场上的新木材一天比一天增多。检尺员和记账员忙得不可开交，不断吆喝着：“四公尺，八公尺！”“矿柱，电柱！”贮木场上，从早到晚，机器响声不断，马匹嘶声不断，人喊声不断。
    所有的贮木场内都有一条铁路，这条铁路通往全国各地。每天都有十来辆空车皮甩进来，大型起重机用它的大爪抓起木材，装上车皮。日日夜夜，长长的装满木材的列车，从大兴安岭林区开往全国各地，到矿山、建筑工地和新铁路线上去支援国家的建设。
    掌灯时分，最后一台拖拉机的响声也停止了。劳累的，冻了一天的人们，走进房舍和工棚，脱掉棉帽棉衣，该有多么暖和！饭后，在灯光下，人们玩扑克牌，看书，唱歌，闲谈，有时候开会，研究工作。有的坐下来写信，向他的家人、朋友，报告大兴安岭森林冬天紧张的战斗和愉快的生活。
