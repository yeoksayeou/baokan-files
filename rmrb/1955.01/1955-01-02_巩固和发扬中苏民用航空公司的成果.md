    Consolidate and Develop the Achievements of the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Corporation
    Shen Tu, Former General Manager of the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Corporation
    The Soviet shares of the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Corporation have been transferred to our country. The business of the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Corporation ceased operations on January 1, 1955. For four and a half years, Soviet comrades of the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Corporation, combining the specific conditions of our country, applied the scientific technology and advanced experience of the Soviet civil aviation industry to our country's civil aviation industry, gradually established a set of scientific management methods, equipped complete technical equipment, and trained a large number of technical cadres. This is the material basis for the Soviet shares of the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Corporation to be transferred to our country for independent operation. We must revisit these valuable experiences to further consolidate and develop the existing achievements of the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Corporation.
    The characteristic of air transport is to organize rapid air transport between long-distance areas. Therefore, airports and stations are always scattered on long routes, and the distance between them often needs to be calculated in hundreds or thousands of kilometers. The route network established by the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Corporation is more than 9,000 kilometers long, with more than ten take-off and landing airports and stations. Airplanes are high-speed means of transportation; currently, general transport aircraft fly at 200-300 kilometers per hour. Such high-speed transportation production in such a vast area inevitably requires highly centralized organization and leadership. The management organization of the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Corporation was organized to adapt to the characteristics of this extremely dispersed area, requiring highly centralized organization and leadership.
    Like industrial enterprises, air transport enterprises should implement a responsibility system. The implementation of a responsibility system in air transport is not only to improve labor productivity, but also to strengthen the responsibility for ensuring safe flight. To implement the production responsibility system, people engaged in production must be familiar with the tools they use and the objects of their work, and strive to fix them. However, in air transport enterprises, the main production tool—the aircraft—flows on the route. Therefore, in the air transport sector, it is more complicated to reasonably organize people, tools, and work objects. According to the characteristics of air transport, the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Corporation established various production groups, such as a certain air crew fixedly driving a certain aircraft, and a certain repair group fixedly responsible for the maintenance and repair of certain parts (such as engines or fuselages) and certain levels (such as pre-flight and post-flight inspections or post-flight 200-hour inspections) of certain aircraft. Within each fixed production group, each staff member has a clear division of labor, and work volume and quality requirements are stipulated.
    Contractual transportation accounts for a small proportion of air transport, and before the basic conditions for the development of air transport enterprises in our country—the aviation industry and technical cadres—are fully available, it is impossible to plan its transportation volume based on the increase in national industrial and agricultural production and commodity turnover, as is the case with other transportation departments. Soviet comrades taught us that, in this case, planning the transportation volume must start from the possibility of increasing aircraft utilization and increasing commercial payload. Four and a half years of practice have proved that this principle is feasible and correct. The plans we have prepared in accordance with this principle have played a great guiding role in exploring internal potential forces. Over the past four years, the number of aircraft of the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Corporation has not increased, and the increase in cadre personnel has been very limited. However, the plan has guided us to work hard to improve the organization and scheduling of aircraft on various routes, improve equipment utilization and work efficiency. The productive flight hours undertaken by each aircraft have increased by 69%, and the transportation turnover has also increased by 89%. The greatest economic effect of striving for aircraft utilization is also reflected in the cumulative increase in the financial surplus of the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Corporation over the past four years.
    Quotas are the basis for preparing plans. China's civil aviation industry had no basis in the past. Whether in terms of labor consumption or production capital, there was no information sufficient to be based on or even referenced for quotas and standards. Over the past four years, Soviet comrades have introduced the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and, based on the specific conditions of our country, systematically determined various economic and technical quotas and standards. Such as flight productivity, depreciation rates of various capital materials, aircraft load capacity, and fuel consumption rates, etc. Even the consumption of fuel and equipment for automobiles used for ground transportation within the enterprise has quotas. We are able to formulate various quotas, especially technical quotas, because we have a sound statistical system. Only on the basis of strengthening statistics can we formulate reasonable and advanced quotas to guide the development and improvement of production.
    The safe flight of air transport has special and important significance. Flight accidents not only seriously affect the completion of production tasks, but also directly cause serious casualties and huge losses of assets. The Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Corporation has not had any flight accidents in the past four and a half years, which is a very important achievement. On the one hand, this is inseparable from the above-mentioned scientific production organization and meticulous and accurate planning management. On the other hand, it is also due to the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Corporation's continuous strengthening of the following three aspects of work:
    First, ensure safe flight from operation. It is extremely important for aviation transport workers with highly comprehensive technology to continuously learn and improve their skills, strengthen organizational discipline, and strictly abide by operating procedures. The aircraft of the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Corporation fly from temperate to frigid zones in one day, fly under various complex weather conditions, and use various different airport surfaces such as cement, gravel, and grassland. According to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, we often organize flight personnel to exchange and summarize experience, familiarize themselves with the flight conditions of routes and landing airports, and conduct skilled flights other than productive flights to enrich experience and improve flight skills by adopting methods such as post-flight debriefings. Only by mastering technology can we operate correctly and further ensure flight safety. For all on-the-job cadres of the company, the leadership guarantees time to conduct regular technical and business learning, and hold technical analysis meetings to continuously improve the technical proficiency and technical level of cadres so that each cadre can accurately complete their duties.
    Second, ensure safe flight from technical equipment. Soviet comrades paid great attention to making various technical equipment further and effectively serve safe flight, and always paid attention to the continuous improvement and improvement of the company's various technical equipment, and paid attention to increasing necessary new equipment. During the past four years, various airports and stations of the company have built and rebuilt many ground buildings, opened up necessary alternate airports, and continuously enriched ground mechanical equipment and communication, radio navigation, and lighting equipment. This has played a great role in ensuring safe flight. Some of these new technical equipment have never been used in our country's civil aviation industry in the past. For example, the installation of ground radio direction finders is something that has never existed before. The direction finder uses radio waves to measure the position of aircraft in the sky hundreds to thousands of kilometers away on the ground. Several direction finders together can measure the position of the aircraft. This plays a great role in assisting pilots to accurately fly aircraft on designated routes.
    Third, ensure safe flight from the system. Soviet comrades repeatedly emphasized that all technical work must strictly abide by the regulations and systems of each professional department. They helped us formulate a scientific aircraft dispatching system in the regulations of the navigation department. The implementation of this system is an important guarantee for safe flight, and the aircraft dispatching problem is directly related to flight safety. In the past, the dispatch and command of aircraft in China's civil aviation was controlled by the aircraft captain, who could disobey ground command; some aircraft were directly commanded by the flight leader of the base station throughout the entire route. These dispatching systems are incorrect and cannot guarantee safe flight. The regional dispatching system of the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Corporation clearly stipulates that the captain must obey the command of the airport/station leader or dispatcher, and there are strict regulations for the release and take-off of aircraft and the acceptance of landing. Aircraft flying in segments on the route are subject to the control of the ground flight commanders of each segment. Such a system can mobilize the ground work of the entire route to serve flight safety. In addition, preventive maintenance systems are stipulated in the regulations of various technical departments. This is also one of the important systems to ensure safe flight. These systems stipulate that various technical departments must conduct regular preventive maintenance of the various equipment and components they manage to preventively eliminate faults and always maintain the equipment and components in good condition. In the particularly important spring/summer and autumn/winter seasonal navigation preparation work, there are also detailed and comprehensive regulations for the maintenance and repair of various equipment and components to preventively defend against various influences and effects of seasonal changes. The preventive maintenance system is not only the best system to ensure flight safety, but also has the effect of extending the service life of equipment and components.
    The Soviet comrades of the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Corporation are actively cultivating Chinese technical cadres with the greatest enthusiasm and the greatest effort. The work of cultivating cadres is carried out in accordance with the principle of combining production and serving production, and is carried out through three main methods: holding training courses, regular business learning for on-the-job cadres, and imparting experience in work. The above three methods are carried out in a planned manner, and the administration guarantees time and stipulates various systems to achieve the expected results.
    Soviet comrades particularly emphasized combining production in the work of cultivating cadres, taking directly improving the quality of work as the teaching purpose and basis, and making teaching work as much as possible on the production site. In classroom teaching, full use is made of image-based teaching materials. Soviet station managers taught our deputy station managers, requiring the deputy station managers to be able to jointly command and handle various practical production work and problems with the station managers on site. This teaching method, which is closely integrated with production, can quickly improve the practical work ability of cadres.
    For the past four and a half years, in the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Corporation, Soviet comrades have imparted to us rich advanced experience of Soviet civil aviation. What is even more valuable is that this many rich advanced experiences have been put into practice and applied in combination with the specific conditions of our country, and are therefore more practically guiding. As the Soviet shares have now been transferred and Soviet comrades will return to their country one after another, all Chinese comrades of our company, in addition to expressing our heartfelt thanks to our sincere Soviet friends—our respected teachers—also express our determination: In the future, under the direct leadership of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, we will redouble our efforts to learn from the Soviet Union, consolidate and develop the achievements of the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Corporation.

    巩固和发扬中苏民用航空公司的成果
    原中苏民用航空公司总经理　沈图
    中苏民用航空公司的苏联股份已经移交给我国了。中苏民用航空公司的业务自一九五五年一月一日起停止进行了。四年半来，中苏民用航空公司的苏联同志结合我国的具体情况，把苏联民用航空事业的科学技术和先进经验，运用到我国的民用航空事业上来，逐步建立了一套科学的管理方法，配备了完善的技术装备，培养了大批技术干部。这是中苏民用航空公司的苏联股份能够移交给我国自力经营的物质基础。我们必须重温这些宝贵的经验，以进一步巩固和发扬中苏民用航空公司的既有成果。
    航空运输的特点是在远距离的地区之间，组织迅速的空中运输。因而航空港、站总是分散在漫长的航线上的，相隔距离常须以一百公里、一千公里计算。中苏民用航空公司建立的航线网有九千余公里，有十余个起飞降落的航空港、站。而飞机是高速度的交通工具，目前一般运输机每小时要飞二、三百公里。这样高速度的运输生产在这样广阔的地区进行，必然要求高度集中的组织领导。中苏民用航空公司的管理机构，就是适应这个地区极其分散、要求高度集中的组织领导的特点，而组织起来的。
    航空运输企业和工业企业一样，应该实行责任制。在航空运输中实行责任制，不仅是为了提高劳动生产率，而且还在于加强保证安全飞行的责任。实行生产责任制，要使进行生产的人熟悉他所使用的工具和工作对象，并力求固定下来。但是在航空运输企业中，主要的生产工具——飞机是流动在航线上的，因而在航空运输部门，合理地把人、工具和工作对象组织起来是较为复杂的。中苏民用航空公司按航空运输的特点，建立了各种生产组，如某一空乘组固定驾驶某架飞机，某一修理组固定负责对某几架飞机进行某部分的（如发动机或机身的）和某一级的（如飞行前后检修或飞行后二百小时的检修）维护检修工作，而在固定的各生产小组内，各工作人员都有明确分工，都规定了工作量和质量要求。
    航空运输中契约性运输占的比重不大，而且在我国航空运输企业发展的基本条件——航空工业和技术干部尚未充分具备以前，就不可能像其它交通运输部门那样，以国家的工、农业生产以及商品周转的增涨为基础，来计划它的运输量。苏联同志教导我们，在这种情况下，计划运输量，必须从飞机利用率增大的可能性和提高商务载重的可能性着手，四年半来的实践，证实了这个原则是可行的、正确的。我们遵循这个原则编制的计划对于发掘内部的潜在力量起了极大的指导作用。四年多来，中苏民用航空公司的飞机没有增加，干部人员增加很有限，但计划引导我们努力改进各航线上飞机的组织调度工作，提高设备利用率和工作效率，每架飞机所担任的生产飞行小时增加了百分之六十九，运输周转量也增长了百分之八十九。这种争取飞机利用率的最大的经济效果，还反映在中苏民用航空公司四年多来财务上盈余的累增。
    定额是编制计划的基碍，中国的民用航空事业过去没有基碍，无论在劳动消耗方面，或是在生产资财方面的定额和标准，都没有足以依据、甚至可以参考的资料。这四年多来，苏联同志们介绍了苏联的先进经验，并依据我国的具体情况，系统地确定了经济上和技术上各种定额和标准。如飞行生产率，各种资财的折旧率，飞机载重量和耗油率等等，甚至企业内地面交通使用的汽车的油料器材消耗等方面都有定额。我们能够制定各种定额，特别是技术定额，是因为我们有完善的统计制度，只有在加强统计的基碍上，才能制定合理的、先进的定额，以指导生产的发展和提高。
    航空运输的安全飞行具有特殊重大意义。飞行事故不仅严重影响生产任务的完成，而且将直接造成严重的生命伤亡和巨大的资财损失。中苏民用航空公司四年半来没有发生飞行事故，是一个很重要的成绩。这一方面是和上述科学的生产组织及周密精确的计划管理分不开的，另一方面，也是由于中苏民用航空公司不断加强了下列三方面的工作：
    第一、从操作上来保证安全飞行。不断学习和提高技术，加强组织性纪律性的锻炼，严格遵守操作规程，对于高度综合性技术的航空运输工作人员是极其重要的。中苏民用航空公司的飞机一天里要从温带飞到寒带，在各种复杂气象条件下飞行，使用水泥、沙砾、草地等各种不同的飞机场场面。根据苏联的先进经验，我们采用飞行后的讲评等方式，经常组织飞行人员交流和总结经验，熟悉航线及起落机场的飞行条件，并进行生产飞行以外的熟练飞行，以丰富经验，提高飞行技术。只有掌握技术，才能正确操作，使飞行安全得到进一步的保证。对于公司的全体在职干部，领导上保证时间，进行经常性的技术业务学习，并举行技术分析会议，不断提高干部的技术熟练程度和技术等级，使每个干部都能确切地完成本身的职责。
      第二，从技术装备上保证安全飞行。苏联同志非常注意使各种技术装备进一步有效地为安全飞行服务，经常关注公司的各种技术装备的不断改进和完善，并且注意增加必要的新装备，这四年多中，公司各航空港、站新建和改建了很多地面建筑，开辟了必要的备降机场，不断的充实地面机械设备和通讯、无线电助航及照明设备。这对于保证安全飞行，起了很大作用。其中有一些新的技术装备，是我国民用航空事业过去从来没有采用过的。例如地面无线电定向台的设施，就是过去未曾有过的，定向台是利用无线电电波，在地面测定数百公里至千余公里以外天空中飞机的方位，几个定向台在一起，就能测定飞机的位置，这对于辅助飞行员驾驶飞机准确地在规定航线上飞行是有很大作用的。
      第三，从制度上来保证安全飞行。苏联同志们再三强调，各项技术工作必须严格遵守各专业部门的条令制度。他们帮助我们在航行部门的规章中制定了科学的飞机调度制度。执行这个制度是安全飞行的重要保证，飞机调度问题直接关系着飞行安全。过去我国民用航空中飞机的调度指挥，有的是由飞机机长来掌握的，机长可以不服从地面指挥；有的是飞机在整条航线中飞行都由基地站的飞行负责人来直接指挥。这些调度制度都是不正确的，不可能保证安全飞行。中苏民用航空公司的区域调度制度明确规定机长必须服从航空港、站首长或调度员的指挥，飞机的放行起飞和接受降落也有严格的规定，飞机在航线上各分段飞行，得受各该分段地面飞行指挥人员的管制。这样的制度就能动员全面航线的地面工作为飞行安全服务。此外，预防性的检修制度在各技术部门的条令中都有规定。这也是保证安全飞行的重要制度之一。这些制度规定，各技术部门对自己管理的各种设备和机件，必须进行定期的预防性的检修工作，以预先排除故障，经常保持设备和机件的完好状态。在特别重要的春夏和秋冬两次换季航行准备工作中，对于各种设备和机件的维护检修，也有详细全面的规定，使其预先防御季节转换的各种影响和作用。预防性的检修制度不仅是保证飞行安全的最好制度，同时还有延长设备和机件使用时限的效果。
    中苏民用航空公司的苏联同志是以最大的热诚和最大的努力，来积极培养中国的技术干部的。培养干部的工作，是本着结合生产，为生产服务的原则，通过三种主要方式进行的：举办训练班、在职干部经常性的业务学习及工作中的传授经验。上述三种方式都是有计划的进行的，行政上保证时间并规定各种制度，使其达到预期的效果。
    苏联同志在培养干部的工作中特别重视结合生产，以直接提高工作质量为教学的目的和依据，使教学工作尽可能在生产现场进行。在课堂教学时，则充分利用形象性的教材。苏联的航空站长教导我国副站长，就要求副站长能在现场与站长共同指挥和处理各项实际生产工作和问题。这种与生产密切结合的教学方法，能够较快地提高干部实际工作的能力。
    四年半来，在中苏民用航空公司中，苏联同志们传授给我们丰富的苏联民用航空的先进经验，更为珍贵的是，这许多丰富的先进经验是经过实践，结合我国具体情况运用的，因而更富有现实的指导意义的。当此苏联股份已移交，苏联工作同志将络绎回国的时候，我们公司全体中国同志除了对于我们真挚的苏联朋友——我们敬爱的老师们表示衷心感谢外，并表示决心：今后在中国民用航空局的直接领导下加倍努力学习苏联，巩固和发扬中苏民用航空公司的成果。
