Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 2nd: At the ceremony welcoming President Ho Chi Minh and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam back to the capital on January 1st, General Võ Nguyên Giáp, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, issued an order to the entire army.

General Võ Nguyên Giáp first expressed, on behalf of all cadres and soldiers of the Vietnamese People's Army, his heartfelt gratitude and firm confidence in the wise leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Vietnam Workers' Party.

General Võ Nguyên Giáp said: Today, after eight or nine years of resistance, President Ho Chi Minh and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have returned to the liberated capital. Our struggle for national liberation has achieved significant success. Peace has been achieved in our beloved motherland. However, peace is not yet consolidated. We are earnestly implementing the Geneva Accords and are determined to defend peace. However, the American imperialists, the French colonialists who are sabotaging the agreement, and their running dog Ngô Đình Diệm clique are now conspiring to undermine certain provisions of the agreements already concluded by both sides in order to destroy peace, divide our country, and turn South Vietnam into an American military base and colony.

Võ Nguyên Giáp pointed out: Precisely because of this, this exhilarating day is also a day for all of us to express our determination to fight and to crush the perfidious schemes of the American imperialists and their followers.

General Võ Nguyên Giáp ordered all cadres and soldiers of the Vietnamese People's Army: to continue to correctly implement the ceasefire agreement and to urge the other party to also correctly implement the ceasefire agreement; to further enhance vigilance and be prepared to stop all activities of the peace saboteurs; to strive to improve political and ideological levels, improve tactical and technical standards, so that the Vietnamese People's Army becomes a strong army to defend peace and defend the motherland.

General Võ Nguyên Giáp concluded: The Vietnamese People's Army, together with the entire people, will surely be able to complete its glorious mission, guarantee the correct implementation of the ceasefire agreement, and become a solid pillar of the political struggle of the entire people, in order to consolidate peace, achieve unification, and complete national independence and democracy.

    武元甲将军在还都典礼上向全军发布命令
    【新华社河内二日电】在一月一日欢迎胡志明主席和越南民主共和国政府还都典礼上，越南人民军总司令武元甲将军向全军发布了命令。
    武元甲将军首先代表越南人民军的全体干部和战士，向胡志明主席、越南民主共和国政府和越南劳动党的英明领导，表示衷心的感谢和坚定的信任。
    武元甲将军说：今天，经过八九年抗战之后，胡志明主席和越南民主共和国政府已经回到解放了的首都。我们争取国家解放的斗争，已经取得了重大的成就。在我们亲爱的祖国，和平已经实现了。但是，和平还不是巩固的。我们认真地履行日内瓦协定，并决心捍卫和平。但是，美帝国主义者、破坏协定的法国殖民分子和他们的走狗吴庭艳集团，现在正阴谋破坏双方已经缔结的协定的某些条款，以便破坏和平、分裂我们的国家、并且把南越变成美国的军事基地和殖民地。
    武元甲指出：正因为如此，令人欢欣鼓舞的今天，对我们大家来说，也是表示我们决心斗争，并且粉碎美帝国主义者及其追随者的背信弃义阴谋的一天。
    武元甲将军命令越南人民军全体干部和战士：继续正确地履行停战协定，并且促使对方也正确地履行停战协定；进一步提高警惕，并且准备制止和平破坏者的一切活动；努力提高政治和思想水平，提高战术和技术标准，使越南人民军成为一支保卫和平、保卫祖国的强大军队。
    武元甲将军最后说：越南人民军和全体人民一起一定能够完成它的光荣任务，保证停战协定的正确履行，成为全体人民政治斗争的坚固支柱，以便巩固和平、实现统一、完成全国独立和民主。
