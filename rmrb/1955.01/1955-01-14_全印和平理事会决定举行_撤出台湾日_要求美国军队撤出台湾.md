Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 13th: The All-India Peace Council has decided to hold "Withdraw from Taiwan Day" on February 6th, calling on people from all walks of life in India to demand that the United States withdraw from Taiwan and to condemn the U.S.-Chiang treaty.

    The All-India Peace Council has issued notices to peace committees throughout India, and has called on all peace-loving groups and individuals to hold meetings and demonstrations on this day to demand that U.S. troops withdraw from Chinese territory—Taiwan and its surrounding waters. The notice also advocates restoring the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.

    Dr. Kitchlew, Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, said in a statement calling for the holding of "Withdraw from Taiwan Day": U.S. troops must withdraw from Taiwan because Taiwan is an indivisible part of China. He said: The All-India Conference for Peace and Asian Solidarity, held a few days ago in Madras, sharply drew people's attention to the serious threat posed by the Taiwan issue to world peace. Kitchlew reminded people not to forget the lessons of the Korean War.

    Dr. Kitchlew finally expressed his firm belief that the voice of the Indian people will help unite international public opinion in support of this just demand, which is crucial to defending world peace.

    全印和平理事会决定举行“撤出台湾日”
    要求美国军队撤出台湾
    【新华社新德里十三日电】全印和平理事会已决定在二月六日举行“撤出台湾日”，呼吁印度各界人民要求美国撤出台湾，并谴责美蒋条约。
    全印和平理事会已向印度各地的和平委员会发出通知，并号召所有爱好和平的团体和个人在这一天举行会议和示威，要求美国军队从中国的领土——台湾及其海面上撤走。通知还主张恢复中华人民共和国在联合国组织中的合法地位。
    全印和平理事会主席克其鲁博士在号召举行“撤出台湾日”的声明中说：美国军队必须撤出台湾，因为台湾是中国不可分割的一部分。他说：几天之前在马德拉斯举行的全印争取和平和亚洲团结大会尖锐地促请人们注意台湾问题对世界和平所构成的严重威胁。克其鲁提醒人们不要忘记朝鲜战争的教训。
    克其鲁博士最后表示坚信印度人民的声音将有助于团结国际舆论支持这个对捍卫世界和平至关重要的正义要求。
