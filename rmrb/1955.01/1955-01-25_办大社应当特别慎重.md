In the cooperative movement of the autumn of 1954, the number of large cooperatives with over 100 households in Xingtai Special District, Hebei Province, increased from 25 before autumn to 450. The increase in large cooperatives was partly a normal reflection of the greater advantages shown by previously well-run large cooperatives and the richer experience of cadres in running cooperatives than in the past. However, it was also partly a manifestation of some cadres' impatience for seeking quick results and craving for large scale, which was not normal. Some people believed that running large cooperatives was a great honor, while running small cooperatives made their work seem backward. Some thought that small cooperatives would eventually be merged into large cooperatives sooner or later, so it would be easier to run large cooperatives sooner. Some village cadres wanted to get rid of production work, so they demanded to run large cooperatives. Some county and district cadres thought that it would be easier to arrange and lead work and count numbers after running large cooperatives, so they actively ran large cooperatives. Supported by these ideas, they ignored the conditions that should be met for running large cooperatives and the difficulties that might be encountered.

The Larger the Cooperative, the More Complex the Problems

Changing farmers' scattered, small-scale production into concentrated, relatively large-scale production is not a simple matter. After the establishment of large cooperatives, the economic situation and production relations in rural areas will undergo great changes, but farmers' old ideas and experiences cannot be quickly and completely reversed with the establishment of large cooperatives. In the large cooperatives that have been established, there are many problems:

(1) The ideological problems of cooperative members are more complex. Most of the villages that run large cooperatives are basically cooperative villages. Although most of the new members joined voluntarily, there are still many people who joined "following the crowd." A few households joined because they were afraid of having difficulties in production outside the cooperative or being isolated. Old members generally believe that small cooperatives are easier to manage and have a solid foundation for production, and they are unwilling to absorb more new members. After the expansion, new and old members generally have a concern, that is, they are afraid that the cooperative will be "divided in heart" if it becomes too large, production will not be done well, and the cooperative cadres will not be able to manage the household well.

(2) After the old cooperative expands or several cooperatives merge, there are often some contradictions between new and old members or between the original small cooperatives. A more common problem is the evaluation of livestock. The market price was higher when the livestock of the original old cooperative was evaluated. Now that the market price has fallen, the new members demand that the livestock of the old members be re-evaluated according to the current market price, which is difficult for the old members to accept. Many cooperatives have disputes over this issue. When several cooperatives merge into one large cooperative, there is a phenomenon of localism within the cooperative. In the autumn of 1954, ten cooperatives in Dongliji Village, Guangzong County, merged into one large cooperative, but the public accumulation funds of each small cooperative were not combined into the large cooperative. Some small cooperatives even distributed the public accumulation funds to each household. When unified planting of wheat, each small cooperative mixed soil into the manure when sending manure to the fields for their own benefit, wanting to get more fertilizer investment from the large cooperative. In some large cooperatives, old members form one group and new members form another group in production activities, unwilling to let the cooperative uniformly allocate labor. These phenomena are obviously also unfavorable to the consolidation of large cooperatives.

(3) There is a lack of planning in management, labor is not well organized, and there is a phenomenon of idling. Baijiazhai Cooperative in Julu County is a large cooperative with more than 130 households, but it did not organize production teams. Cooperative members go to the cooperative director every day to ask for work. Some cooperatives are still like running small cooperatives, assigning work temporarily when walking to the fields, wasting time. In some cooperatives, no one is responsible for production work. The new members of Yinjia Township Cooperative in Xingtai County did not pull out the cotton firewood when they should have, thinking that autumn plowing was the cooperative's business and they could not be responsible for it. In Dongliji Cooperative in Guangzong, no one cared about the pigs being soaked in water.

(4) The work delay of the cadres of large cooperatives is a practical problem. Many cadres of large cooperatives are the main cadres of the township or village. In addition to managing cooperative affairs, they also have a lot of party affairs and administrative work to do, and there are more meetings, which affects their leadership of cooperative affairs.

In some original old cooperatives, individual cooperative cadres have a bad work style and are divorced from the masses. They have not re-elected cooperative cadres after the expansion, which hinders the development of cooperative members' production enthusiasm.

Build a Solid Foundation Before Building a Tall Building

Most of the large cooperatives in Xingtai Special District are expanded on the basis of the original old cooperatives. In the past, their cooperatives were small with few households, and the land was not concentrated enough, which was subject to certain restrictions in unified management. Cooperative members sometimes felt inconvenient in labor. They required the land to be as continuous as possible, the planting of crops to be more concentrated, and the use of labor to be more unified. Some cooperative members and non-cooperative masses jointly owned livestock, farm tools, irrigation wells, etc., and some contradictions constantly occurred during use. During the busy farming season, it even affected production. The masses inside and outside the cooperative demanded that these problems be solved. Under the influence of the examples of the old cooperatives increasing production and increasing income, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of peasants has been continuously improved, and more and more peasants are determined to join the cooperative. Under this circumstance, it is very natural to expand and build large cooperatives on the basis of the original old cooperatives. For example, Gongjiawa Cooperative in Nangong had 21 households in 1952, expanded to 51 households in 1953, expanded to 229 households in the spring of 1954, and has now expanded to 266 households. Such development not only conforms to the actual situation of the continuous improvement of the masses' consciousness, but also is of great benefit to the gradual improvement of the leadership experience and ability of cooperative cadres.

Some of the large cooperatives established in Xingtai Special District in the autumn of 1954 were also "boomed" up out of nowhere. In Mowo Village, Neiqiu County, a large cooperative with 105 households was established in the winter of 1953 to the spring of 1954. The leadership of this cooperative was relatively strong, the masses had a high level of ideological consciousness, and no problems occurred in one year, and production was improved. After last autumn, all 134 households in the village (all of whom have joined the cooperative) sold more than 74,000 catties of surplus grain to the state. However, after all, only a few can develop in this way. Generally speaking, it is not easy to consolidate a pile that is raised from the ground. For example, in Xiliu Village, Xinhe County, a large cooperative with more than 130 households was established in the autumn of 1954, but the backbone was not strong, there was no experience in running a cooperative, and the members' thinking was very chaotic. Zhangtai Village, Ren County, built a new large cooperative. The members relied on the cooperative cadres for everything. The cooperative cadres had no way to deal with it and actually hid in other villages. Judging from these situations, generally speaking, it is better to run a cooperative according to the law of development from small to large. Of course, if only small cooperatives with less than 10 households are run, there are too many units, which are not easy to lead, and it is not easy to show the superiority of cooperatives, which should also be opposed. However, it is more dangerous to run a large cooperative with hundreds of households at once, and to run many at once. "A tall building rises from the ground," it is necessary to first lay a good foundation, and then build it layer by layer. If the foundation is not good, and it is rushed to develop higher and larger, it will be difficult to clean up when it collapses.

The Xingtai Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China has instructed all counties to quickly concentrate the leading forces of the cooperative movement on rectification and consolidation work. In particular, for large cooperatives, it is necessary to send capable cadres to review them one by one. Those that are expanded and established on the basis of better old cooperatives, have strong leadership backbone, high degree of mass consciousness, and have experience in running medium-sized cooperatives with dozens of households, should be retained and run well. Those who basically meet the above conditions, but do not have enough experience in running a cooperative and some members are not ideologically mature enough, and can be run well with the help of the leadership, should strengthen their work and strive to run well. Those that cannot be run well or are not sure of running well, the leaders of each county must resolutely reduce them in size through patient persuasion and active initiative as early as possible, first run small cooperatives well, and then run large cooperatives when conditions are ripe.

    办大社应当特别慎重
    邵星
    在一九五四年秋季的合作化运动当中，河北省邢台专区百户以上的大社由秋前的二十五个增加到了四百五十个。大社的增多，一部分是过去办好的大社显示了较大优越性和干部办社经验比过去丰富了的表现，是正常的；一部分却是某些干部有贪多求大的急躁情绪的表现，是不正常的。有些人认为办大社才是大光荣，办小社就显得自己的工作落后了；有些人认为办小社早晚得合并成大社，还不如早些办大社省事；有的村干部为了想脱离生产而要求办大社；有的县区干部认为办了大社以后工作好布置、好领导，数字好统计，所以积极办大社。在这些思想的支持下，他们就忽视了办大社应具备的条件和可能碰到的困难。
    社越大问题越复杂
    把农民的分散的、小规模的生产改变成集中的、比较大规模的生产，不是一个简单的问题。大社建成以后，农村的经济情况和生产关系将起一个很大的变化，但农民的旧思想和老经验并不能随着大社的建成很快地完全扭转过来。在已建成的大社中，存在着不少问题：
      （一）社员的思想问题比较复杂。办大社的村，大都是基本合作化的村，多数新社员虽然都是自愿入社的，但还有不少人是“随大流”入社的；有少数户是怕自己留在社外生产上有困难、或者是怕孤立而加入的。老社员一般认为小社好管理，生产有底子，不愿意多吸收新社员。在扩大以后，新老社员较普遍地有一个思想顾虑，就是怕社大了“人多心不齐”，生产搞不好，社干部当不好家。
    （二）老社扩大或是几个社合并以后，新老社员之间或者原来的各个小社之间，往往有一些矛盾。较为普遍的是牲口评价问题。原来老社牲口评价时市价较高，现在市价降落了，新社员要求把老社员的牲口按现在市价重评，老社员很难接受，为这个问题发生争执的社很多。几个社合并成一个大社的，社内有闹本位主义的现象。广宗县董里集村的十个社一九五四年秋季合并成一个大社，各个小社的公积金都没有往大社合，有的小社还把公积金分给各户了。在统一种麦时，各个小社为了本身的利益，往地内送粪时搀土，想多得大社的肥料投资款。有的大社在生产活动中，老社员一伙，新社员一伙，不肯让社统一支配劳动力。这些现象对于大社的巩固显然也是不利的。
    （三）在经营管理上缺乏计划性，劳动力组织得不好，有窝工现象。钜鹿县白家寨社，是一百三十多户的大社，并没有组织生产队，社员每天去找社长要活干；有的社还和办小社时一样，往地里走时才临时派工，浪费了时间。有的社的生产工作无人负责。邢台县尹贾乡社新社员的棉柴该拔不拔，他们认为秋耕是社的事，自己可以不负责了；广宗董里集社的猪让水泡着也没人管。
    （四）大社社干部的误工是一个实际问题。很多大社社干部是乡或村的主要干部，他们除了操持社务以外，还有很多党务和行政工作要做，开会也比较多，这就影响了他们对于社务的领导。
    有些原有的老社，个别社干部作风不好，脱离群众，扩大后还没有另选社干部，这就阻碍了社员的生产积极性的发挥。
    盖大楼先要把基础打结实
    邢台专区的大社大部分是以原来的老社为基础扩大而成的。它们过去社小户少，土地不够集中，在统一经营上还受着一定的限制；社员在劳动中有时也感到有些不方便；他们要求土地尽可能地连起片来，要求种植作物更加集中，劳力使用更加统一。有些社员和社外群众伙有牲口、农具、浇地水井等，在使用时不断发生一些矛盾，在农忙时甚至还会影响生产。这些问题社内社外群众都要求加以解决。在老社增加生产、增加收入的实例影响下，广大农民社会主义觉悟不断提高，坚决要求入社的农民越来越多了。在这种情况下，以原有的老社为基础扩建成为大社，就是很自然的事情。像南宫巩家洼社，一九五二年二十一户，一九五三年扩大为五十一户，一九五四年春扩大为二百二十九户，现在又扩大到二百六十六户。这样发展，不仅合乎群众觉悟不断提高的实际情况，而且对社干部领导经验和能力的逐步提高也是有很大好处的。
    邢台专区一九五四年秋季办的大社，也有一些是平地一声雷“轰”起来的。内邱县磨窝村，在一九五三年冬到一九五四年春一下就建立了一个一百零五户的大社。这个社的领导力量较强，群众思想觉悟较高，一年中没有发生什么问题，并且提高了生产；去年秋后全村一百三十四户（已全部入社）卖给国家余粮七万四千余斤。不过，能这样发展的毕竟是少数；一般地说，平地起堆，是不大容易巩固的。如新河县西流村，一九五四年秋季一下建立起来一个一百三十多户的大社，可是骨干并不强，没有办社经验，社员思想很混乱。任县章台村新建了一个大社，社员事事依靠社干部，社干部没有办法，竟躲到外村去了。从这些情况看来，一般地说，办社还是按照由小到大的规律为好。当然，如果只办十户以下的小社，单位太多，不好领导，而且不容易显示出合作社的优越性，也是应当反对的。但是，一下子就办成百户的大社，而且一下子办很多，更有危险性。“万丈高楼平地起”，是要先把基础打好，然后一层一层盖上去的；基础不好，匆匆忙忙地往高往大发展，垮下来，就很难收拾了。
    中共邢台地委已经指示各县迅速把合作化运动的领导力量集中到整顿和巩固工作方面来，特别是对于大社，必须派得力干部逐个进行审查。凡是以较好的老社为基础扩大、建立起来的，领导骨干强，群众觉悟程度高，又有办几十户的中社的经验的，就保留下来，把它切实办好。基本上是具备以上条件，但是办社经验还不够、部分社员思想还不够成熟，经过领导方面帮助能够办好的，要加强工作，力争办好。不能办好或没有把握办好的，各县领导方面要坚决地经过耐心的说服工作，及早地主动地把它化小，先办好小社，条件成熟了再办大社。
