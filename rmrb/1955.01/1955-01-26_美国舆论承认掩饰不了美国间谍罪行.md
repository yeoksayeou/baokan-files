Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Some American newspapers and magazines admit that the United States has been unable to conceal the fact that the United States is engaged in espionage activities against China.

    "U.S. News & World Report" magazine said on the 14th: "The United States is suspected in Asia. … In any case, American pilots are considered guilty by Asians."
      The "New York Post" published an article by Max Lerner on the 6th writing that he "had been to Japan, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. Everywhere, Asians know our (American) poorly kept secrets—that we are working closely with Chiang Kai-shek in harassing activities against mainland China; during the Korean War, and since the Korean armistice, our pilots have been carrying out what our military missions in Japan and Taiwan call 'aggressive reconnaissance' missions. Asians noted that Dulles did not protest the sentencing of two Americans, Downey and Fecteau. These two are probably American intelligence personnel."

    美国舆论承认掩饰不了美国间谍罪行
    【新华社讯】美国一些报刊承认，美国没有能掩饰得了美国对中国进行间谍活动的事实。
    “美国新闻与世界报道”杂志十四日说：“美国在亚洲是受人猜疑的。……无论如何，美国飞行员被亚洲人认为是有罪的。”
      “纽约邮报”六日刊载马克斯·勒纳的一篇文章写道：他“到过日本、台湾和香港。每个地方，亚洲人都知道我们（美国）那些保持得很拙劣的不成其为秘密的秘密——在对中国大陆的骚扰行动中我们是和蒋介石密切合作的；在朝鲜战争时期，以及朝鲜停战以来，我们的飞行员一直在执行我们在日本和台湾的军事使团称之为‘侵略侦察’的任务。亚洲人注意到，杜勒斯没有对判处两个美国人唐奈和费克图一节提出抗议。这两个人大概是美国的谍报人员。”
