The Vietnam National United Front has a national and democratic character. The goals of the United Front's struggle are: peace, unification, independence, and democracy; it is necessary to resolutely struggle against the US imperialists, the French colonialists who are sabotaging the armistice agreement, and their running dog Ngo Dinh Diem clique.

    Truong Chinh also said that the Congress agreed to convene a broader national conference to adopt a new political program and a new organizational law suitable for the new situation. To this end, a broad preparatory committee will be established with the participation of representatives of the people inside and outside the National United Front.

    Subsequently, Nguyen Xuan Thuy, member of the Standing Committee of the Vietnam National United Front, and Du Duc Duc, member of the National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front, read out the draft resolution and proclamation of the Congress. The proclamation of the National Congress called on all the people of Vietnam, regardless of political affiliation or ethnicity, to actively respond to the movement to expand the National United Front, to resolutely fight to defend peace, realize unification, and achieve independence and democracy throughout the country, and to smash the conspiracies of the US imperialists and their running dogs.
   The National Congress also passed four telegrams to President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese People's Army, the people of South Vietnam, and the people of France.

    The achievements of the National Congress of the Vietnam National United Front are a major political victory for the Vietnamese people. It will have a significant impact on expanding and consolidating the unity of the whole of Vietnam and realizing the current tasks.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 12th: On January 8th, a mass rally against US intervention in Indochina was held in Phu Ly, the capital of Ha Nam province, south of Hanoi, with the participation of approximately 70,000 people from all walks of life, suburban farmers, and soldiers and cadres.
