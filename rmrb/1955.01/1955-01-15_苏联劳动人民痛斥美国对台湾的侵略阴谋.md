Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 13th: The provocative actions of the American imperialists attempting to obstruct the Chinese people from building a happy life have aroused deep anger among the Soviet laboring people. In letters written to the editorial department of "Labor News," the Soviet people angrily denounced the American intrigue to invade Taiwan and fully supported the Chinese people's determination to liberate the island, which has always been Chinese territory. The following are excerpts from some of the letters received by the editorial department of "Labor News":

    Va. Krestyaninov, Chairman of the Moscow City Trade Union Council, wrote that Taiwan has been Chinese since ancient times. Everyone knows this. What right does the United States have to invade territory that has always been Chinese?

    The aggressive and provocative actions of the United States against the People's Republic of China—concluding the so-called "mutual defense treaty" with the Kuomintang bandit gang—have aroused not only the legitimate anger of the Chinese people, but also the legitimate anger of all honest people in the world, including the Soviet people.

    The Soviet people fully support the legitimate demands of the Chinese people: to liberate Taiwan, for the withdrawal of American troops from this Chinese territory, and to stop American aggression against the People's Republic of China.

    F. Torgalo, a tunneling worker and honorary miner from the sixth mine in the Donbas Second District, said: We, the Soviet people, understand the feelings of the Chinese people. We know how the imperialists once attempted to eliminate the world's first Soviet state. However, the experience of the Soviet people proves that the people are invincible.

    The liberation of Taiwan is a just and noble cause of the Chinese people. Since this cause is just, it will surely be victorious. That is why I believe that Taiwan will be reunited with the peace-loving and free Chinese mainland.

    Ponomarenko, a milling worker at the Lenin Metallurgical Machinery Factory, wrote that no sane and honest person in the world would believe the words of the heads of American aggression policy that the treaty they recently concluded with Chiang Kai-shek was for American defense. It should be known that Taiwan is not on the coast of the United States, but on the coast of China, more than ten thousand kilometers away from the United States. Taiwan has always belonged to China. It is only right that the Chinese people demand that the Americans get out of Taiwan. They have resolutely expressed their indomitable will to liberate Taiwan, an inseparable part of Chinese territory.

    Ponomarenko emphasized: Let our Chinese brothers know that the Soviet people will always support the just and noble cause of the Chinese people.

    苏联劳动人民痛斥美国对台湾的侵略阴谋
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十三日讯：美帝国主义者企图阻碍中国人民建设幸福生活的挑衅行动，引起了苏联劳动人民的深切愤怒。苏联人民在写给“劳动报”编辑部的信件中，愤怒地痛斥美国对台湾的侵略阴谋，完全支持中国人民要求解放这个历来就是中国领土的岛屿的决心。“劳动报”编辑部所收到的一些信件如下：
    莫斯科市工会理事会主席瓦·克雷斯特雅尼诺夫写道，台湾自古以来就是中国的。关于这一点我们每一个人都知道，美国有什么权利侵占历来是中国的领土？
    美国对中华人民共和国的侵略性挑衅行动——同国民党匪帮缔结所谓“共同防御条约”，不仅引起了中国人民的正当愤怒，而且引起了世界上全体正直的人们，其中包括苏联人民的正当愤怒。
    苏联人民完全支持中国人民的合法要求：解放台湾，美军撤离这块中国的领土以及停止美国对中华人民共和国的侵略行动。
    顿巴斯乙区第六号矿井的掘进工人、荣誉矿工弗·托尔加洛说道：我们苏联人民了解中国人民的心情。我们知道，帝国主义者曾如何企图消灭世界上的第一个苏维埃国家。但是，苏联人民的经验证明，人民是不可战胜的。
    解放台湾是中国人民的正义和崇高的事业。既然这种事业是正义的，那就一定会胜利。正因为这样，我相信台湾将会同爱好和平的自由的中国的大陆重新统一起来。
    列宁冶炼机器工厂的铣工波诺马伦科写道，世界上没有一个思想健康的正直人士会相信美国侵略政策的头子所说的他们最近同蒋介石缔结的条约是为了美国的防御。要知道，台湾不是在美国的海岸，而是在中国的海岸，距美国有一万多公里。台湾向来是属于中国的。中国人民要求美国人从台湾滚走是理所当然的。他们坚决地表示了他们对解放中国领土不可分割的一部分——台湾的不屈不挠的意志。
    波诺马伦科强调说：让我们的中国弟兄们知道：苏联人民永远支持中国人民的正义和崇高的事业。
