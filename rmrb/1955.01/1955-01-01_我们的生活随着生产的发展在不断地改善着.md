    Our Lives Are Constantly Improving with the Development of Production
    Yu Jinhua, Model Worker of Yumen Oil Mine
    I grew up in Laojunmiao. At the age of thirteen, I was digging for gold for the landlord in the petroleum river beach. At that time, besides a small temple, there were only sand, stones, and the endless Gobi Desert. Even shepherds didn't come here. In 1938, a group of people came and said they wanted to start an oil mine here. They worked for several years and only drilled a few holes in the ground, saying they were oil wells. But what kind of oil wells were those? They were almost like the villagers' water wells. People used small buckets to hoist the oil up and then carried it to the refinery. The "refinery" was just a fancy name; in reality, it was just a big pot. That was the oil mine at the time.

    After the mine opened, I joined it, but my life remained the same. During the day, I wore a tattered sheepskin coat to work, and at night, I covered myself with the same tattered sheepskin coat to sleep. The little money I earned still wasn't enough to fill my stomach. The only difference was that my body was covered with a layer of black crude oil that couldn't be washed off. The landlord's beating stick became the foreman's whip and the mine police's bayonet.

    After liberation, the Yumen Oil Mine became the people's oil field. In the past few years, it has become very different from what it used to be. The Party led us to start a large-scale construction. We often see new oil wells, new oil separation stations, newly built factory buildings, and newly installed machines put into production. When we get up early in the morning, we are busy receiving new production equipment from drilling, installation, and construction workers. When we see rows of derricks standing up, see the huge oil storage tanks and separators shining silver in the sunlight, and see the crude oil spraying out from more than a thousand meters underground, we feel even closer to them than to our own children. Our factory is getting bigger and bigger every day, the number of employees is increasing every day, and our enthusiasm for work is growing.

    With the development of production, our lives are constantly improving. Now we live in new dormitories with complete furniture, bright electric lights, and convenient and clean gas stoves. The development of various collective welfare programs is even faster. Our mine already has sanatoriums, convalescent homes, cinemas, and the hospital has also been expanded many times. Our spare-time schools and quick literacy classes are doing well. After studying in the quick literacy class, I can read newspapers, read documents, and write some simple reports.

    When I was the leader of the trade union group, thanks to studying the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union and other places, the whole group was united and reversed the past situation of many accidents and low production. We achieved safe production for seven consecutive months, overfulfilled the national plan, and won the factory's mobile red flag. Everyone elected me as a model worker. In fact, all this work is my duty. If there are any achievements in the work, it is also because of the Party's correct leadership and everyone's efforts. Last year, everyone elected me as the chairman of the oil extraction workshop's trade union. The scope of work is larger, the tasks are heavier, and the difficulties have also increased, but I am confident to unite the masses and do a good job in production.

    Petroleum is like the blood of the national industry. Without petroleum, machines cannot turn, airplanes cannot fly, cars cannot run, and tractors cannot plow the land. How can there be industrialization? Now, the state has given us a great task—to build the Yumen Oil Mine into the country's first petroleum base. We will never fail the expectations of the country and the people. We will work hard to accumulate construction capital for the country, cultivate talents in our work, and prepare to develop the second and third new oil fields. We swear: We will dedicate everything we have to the socialist construction of the motherland.

    我们的生活随着生产的发展在不断地改善着
    玉门油矿劳动模范  于金华
    我自小生长在老君庙。十三岁的时候，就在石油河滩里给地主挖金子。那时候，这里除掉有一座小庙以外，只有些砂子、石头，和一眼看不到边的戈壁滩，放羊的都不到这里来。一九三八年，来了一批人，说要在这里开油矿。他们闹了好几年的工夫，才在地上打了几个窟窿，说那就是油井，其实那算什么油井，简直和老乡们的水井差不多，人们用小桶把油吊上来，再挑着送到炼油厂去。“炼油厂”也只是名字好听，实际上只有一口大锅，当时的油矿就是这样。
    开矿以后，我入了矿，生活还是照旧。白天穿着破皮袄工作，晚上盖着破皮袄睡觉。赚的几个钱仍然填不饱肚子，所不同的是身上多了一层黑糊糊洗不掉的原油。地主手里打人的棒子，变成了工头手里的鞭子和矿警队手里的刺刀。
    解放了，玉门油矿变成了人民的油田，几年来它已和过去大不相同了。党领导着我们开始了大建设。我们常常可以看到新的油井、新的选油站或新盖的厂房、新装的机器投入生产。我们一清早爬起来，就忙着从钻井、安装、建筑工人手里接收新的生产设备。当我们看着一排排的井架立起来，看着在太阳光下闪着银光的巨大的储油罐和分离器，看着从千多公尺深的地下喷出来的原油时，简直比看到自己的孩子还要亲。我们的厂子一天天大起来，职工一天天多起来，我们干活的劲头越来越大。
    随着生产的发展，我们的生活不断地得到改善。现在我们住的新宿舍，家具齐全，电灯明亮，还有方便干净的瓦斯炉子。各种集体福利事业发展还要快。我们矿上已经有了业余休养所、疗养院、电影院，医院也扩大了好多倍。我们的业余学校和速成识字班办得都不错。我在速成识字班里学了后，就能看报、看文件、写一些简单的报告。
    我当工会小组长的时候，由于学习了苏联和各地的先进经验，全组团结一致，扭转了过去事故多，生产低的现象，连续七个月安全生产，超额完成了国家计划，获得了全厂的流动红旗。大家把我选为劳动模范。其实这些工作都是自己的本份。如果说工作中有些成绩，也是因为党的正确领导和大伙的努力，去年大家又选我当采油车间工会主席，工作范围大啦，任务重啦，困难也增多啦，但是我有信心团结好群众，把生产搞好。
    石油好像国家工业的血液一样，没有石油机器不能转，飞机不能飞，汽车不能跑，拖拉机也不能耕地，那里还有工业化呢？现在，国家给了我们一个很大的任务——要把玉门油矿建设成祖国的第一个石油基地。我们决不辜负国家和人民对我们的期望，努力为国家积累建设本钱，在工作中培养人才，准备开发第二、第三个新的油田，我们宣誓：要把我们的一切献给祖国的社会主义建设。
