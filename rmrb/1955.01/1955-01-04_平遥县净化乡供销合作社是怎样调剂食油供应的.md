How the Jinghua Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Pingyao County Regulates Edible Oil Supply
National Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Headquarters Supply Bureau

Jinghua Township in Pingyao County, Shanxi Province, is located in the central Shanxi basin. The soil is fertile, and it is rich in grain, cotton, and other oil crops.

In 1954, the acreage planted with oil crops accounted for 68% of the total cultivated land, with an oil yield of over 2 million jin. Soybean production accounted for 74.8% of the total oil crop production, cottonseed accounted for 19.7%, and rapeseed accounted for 1.2%.

According to estimates from 1953, of the oil crops produced locally, 8% was used for feed, 7% was eaten as food, 73% was sold, 4% was used for seeds, and 8% was used for oil extraction, cake production, and processing.

According to a survey of typical households, in 1953, the average household (3-6 people) used about one jin of oil per month, while households with larger incomes used about two jin. This amount was also higher than before. Middle peasant Wu Zengrong, a family of six, could only eat five jin of oil per year before liberation. After liberation, oil consumption increased year by year, reaching 10.5 jin in 1952, 13.5 jin in 1953, and 18 jin in 1954. Among the masses, oil consumption was generally higher during busy farming seasons and festivals, as well as for weddings and funerals. Oil consumption was lower on ordinary days.

After the implementation of unified purchase of oil crops in December 1953, the total amount of oil consumed by the masses was slightly less than before, but the situation varied from household to household. Among the seven typical households surveyed in Jinghua Township, five households (four middle peasant households and one poor peasant household) consumed more oil than they had previously, while two households (both poor peasants) consumed less.

However, thanks to the vigorous efforts of the supply and marketing cooperative in organizing oil mills to process oil for the masses and regulate supply, the difficulties in edible oil supply after the unified purchase of oil crops were effectively overcome, and the problem of oil consumption was largely solved.

In August of the year before last, the Jinghua Township grassroots supply and marketing cooperative leased a private oil mill that had been shut down and purchased oil crops for processing into finished products, exchanging oil for materials. From August 20, 1953, to the end of the year, a total of 105,939 jin of rapeseed, soybeans, cottonseed, small hemp seeds, sesame, and cottonseed cake were processed. According to the county cooperative's regulations, 45% was turned over to the county cooperative, and 4,674 jin were sold to the Wenshui County Cooperative and the Taiyuan Baige Cooperative. The remaining amount was all retailed to the masses, with a portion used to support the supply in January and February of last year.

In January of last year, the cooperative purchased the entire oil mill and took over a private sesame oil mill, processing oil for the masses and exchanging edible oil for oil crops to help them solve the problem of oil consumption. In terms of oil processing methods, the cooperative adopted a system of real deposits and pre-sales, encouraging the masses to deposit soybeans with the oil mill. The most amount of oil crops deposited in 1953 was over 20,000 jin, and even last year, there were often several thousand jin deposited. To facilitate depositors, they could withdraw money, oil, cake, or have processing done at any time. For households that did not deposit oil crops, the cooperative also provided processing services according to the principle of convenience for the masses, combined with inventory conditions, processing for them as they came. From January to August of last year, the cooperative processed 73,652 jin of beans for 1,193 households, producing 7,298 jin of oil, solving the edible oil and feed problems for households with oil crops in the township and neighboring townships, and the masses expressed satisfaction.

In terms of regulating supply, the edible oil obtained by the oil mill, except for the portion turned over to the county supply and marketing cooperative, was all retailed to the masses. In January and February of 1954, the Jinghua Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative used the edible oil stored from 1953 to supply oil to the population, limiting the amount but not the number of times, with each person receiving half a jin of oil each time. After March, the supply method was changed to flexibly control and conduct irregular and variable-quantity adjustments based on the purpose, object, oil shortage situation, and the amount of edible oil in stock. For example, oil was supplied to households with oil shortages upon presentation of a certificate from the township government. For oil consumption during festivals, supplies were provided upon presentation of a township government slip, a cooperative member certificate, or a temporary oil purchase certificate issued by the supply and marketing cooperative. For special oil consumption for weddings, funerals, childbirth, and illness, a regular, variable-quantity supply method was adopted, with the township (or village) government controlling the supply quantity and issuing certificates.

In this way, through the processing and turnover of the oil mill, edible oil was accumulated, oil-deficient households were supplied, oil for production and special purposes was guaranteed, and a certain amount was supplied for festival consumption.

The edible oil supply and regulation work in Jinghua Township still needs improvement. For example, the current characteristic of oil consumption among the masses in the township is: those with surplus oil crops can eat oil, those with more surplus eat more, and those with less eat less, while those without any cannot eat (and can only rely on the supply and marketing cooperative). This has led to the phenomenon of uneven distribution of happiness and suffering, with some having a surplus of edible oil and others finding it difficult to obtain a single drop. Therefore, in the future, we should vigorously encourage farmers to adjust surpluses and shortages and organize farmers to buy and sell oil crops through the national grain market to share surpluses and meet shortages.

The oil extraction rate set by the Jinghua Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative is also lower than the actual oil extraction rate. The oil extraction rate for soybeans is set at 14 jin of oil and 140 jin of cake per dan, and for black beans, it is 13 jin of oil and 141 jin of cake per dan. In reality, the oil extraction rate for soybeans is 16.5 jin of oil and 142 jin and 12 liang of cake, and for black beans, it is 15.5 jin of oil and 143 jin and 12 liang of cake. Therefore, 2.5 jin of oil and 2 jin and 12 liang to 3 jin and 12 liang of cake are underpaid to the masses for each dan, totaling 13,000 to 14,000 yuan. This is an unreasonable income. In the future, the supply and marketing cooperative's oil mill processing should operate on the principle of mutual benefit and should pay for oil and cake at the general actual oil and cake extraction rates when processing for the masses. If edible oil is reduced in order to acquire some edible oil to regulate the supply to oil-deficient households, this should be explained to the masses, and compensation should be made by paying cash or reducing processing fees.

In addition, the enthusiasm and creativity of employees should be further utilized, and the experience of "Li Chuanjiang's advanced oil pressing method" should be learned to increase the oil extraction rate, increase oil sources, and create more wealth for the country.

Currently, there are two types of edible oil waste in Jinghua Township: (1) All oil for production purposes is supplied with cottonseed oil, soybean oil, and even sesame oil, which is a huge amount. (2) Farmers generally feed livestock with black beans and cottonseed, which consumes a large amount of oil sources. Therefore, we suggest: (1) Try to find waste engine oil and other non-edible oils to replace oil for production purposes as much as possible. According to reports from various places, waste engine oil is both easy to use and saves money, and is very popular with farmers. (2) Promote the use of cake as feed among farmers, using detailed calculations to let farmers know that if they feed a livestock 600 jin of beans a year, they will invisibly get 60 jin more oil if they replace it with cake, which can solve their own oil consumption problem and can also be sold to help oil-deficient households, killing two birds with one stone. This can be tried as a model feeding method in agricultural production cooperatives first, and then推广推广after proving its effectiveness.

    平遥县净化乡供销合作社是怎样调剂食油供应的
    全国供销合作总社供应局
    山西省平遥县净化乡位于晋中盆地，土壤肥沃，盛产粮食棉花及其它油料。
    一九五四年，油料种植亩数占耕地总面积百分之六十八，产油达二百多万斤。其中大豆产量即占油料总产量的百分之七四·八；棉籽占百分之十九·七；油菜籽占百分之一·二。
    当地所产油料，据一九五三年估计，用作饲料的占百分之八，作为粮食吃的百分之七，出卖的百分之七三，种籽百分之四，换油、饼及加工的百分之八。
    根据典型户的调查，一九五三年一般户（三—六口人）平均每月用油在一斤左右，收入较大的达二斤左右。这个数目，也比从前多。中农吴增荣，六口人，解放前每年只能吃五斤油，解放以后用油数逐年上升，一九五二年为十斤半，一九五三年十三斤半，一九五四年十八斤。群众中一般是农忙、过节期间，用油量比重较大，婚丧喜事也用油较多。平日用油较少。
    一九五三年十二月实行油料统购以后，群众用油的总量比以前少了一些，但每户的情况，则各有不同。净化乡调查的七个典型户中，有五户（四户中农一户贫农）的用油量，比他们以前实用量仍有增加，两户（均为贫农）减少。
    但是，由于供销合作社大力组织油坊代群众加工和调剂供应的结果，有力地克服了油料统购以后食油供应的困难，大体上解决了用油问题。
    净化乡基层供销合作社前年八月租赁了一座已停工的私人油坊，并收购油料，加工成品，以油换料。一九五三年八月二十日至年底止，计加工了油菜籽、大豆、棉籽、小麻籽、芝麻、棉仁饼等一○五、九三九斤，按照县社规定上缴百分之四十五，并卖给文水县社和太原白格社共四、六七四斤，余数全部零售供应群众；其中一部分支持去年一、二月份的供应。
    去年一月，该社将这座油坊全部购买过来，又接收私人香油磨坊一座，代群众加工，以食油换油料帮助群众解决吃油问题。在油料加工方式上，该社采取了存实预售工作，即发动群众向油坊寄存大豆。一九五三年存油料最多时达二万多斤，去年也经常寄存数千斤。为便利寄存户起见，随时可以取款，取油、取饼或加工。对于没寄存油料的户也根据便利群众的原则，结合库存情况，随来随换，数量较大或库存不多时，代为加工。去年一至八月份为一、一九三户群众加工豆子七三、六五二斤，产油七、二九八斤，解决了本乡和邻乡有料户的食油和饲料问题，因而群众都表示满意。
    在调剂供应方面，油坊所取得的食油，除上缴县供销合作社外，一概零售供应群众。净化乡供销合作社一九五四年一、二月份，利用一九五三年存下的食油，采取限量不限次，每次半斤油的办法按人口供应。三月份以后供应办法改为根据用途，对象、缺油情况结合库存食油数量，灵活掌握，进行不定期不定量的调剂供应。例如对缺油户，凭乡政府证明条供应。群众节日用油，凭乡政府条、社员证或供销社发出的临时购油证进行供应。婚、丧、产、病等特殊用油则采取经常的、不定量的供应办法，一概由乡（或村）政府掌握供应数量和开发证明条。
    这样，通过油坊的加工周转，积累了食油，供应了缺油户，保证了生产用油和特殊用油，并以一定数量供应节日用油。
    净化乡食油供应和调剂工作，也还有需要改进的地方，例如目前该乡群众吃油的特点是：有余料者就能吃到油，余料多者多吃，少者少吃，没有者不能吃（只好依靠供销社供应）。出现了有的食油过剩和有的滴油难得的苦乐不均现象。因此今后应大力鼓励农民进行有无调剂，并组织农民通过国家粮食市场进行油料的买卖，互通有无。
    净化乡供销合作社所订出油率也低于实际出油率，黄豆每石出油为十四斤，饼一四○斤，黑豆十三斤，饼一四一斤，而实际上黄豆出油为十六斤半，饼一四二斤十二两，黑豆十五斤半，饼一四三斤十二两。因此，每担少付出群众二斤半的油和二斤十二两至三斤十二两的饼，合一万三千多元至一万四千多元。这是一笔不合理的收入。今后供销合作社油坊加工应本着互不吃亏的原则办事，代群众加工应按照一般的实际出油率、出饼率支付油、饼。如果为了要收购一些食油调剂缺油户，而减付食油，则应向群众说明，并以支付现款或减收加工费抵偿。
    此外，还应更进一步发挥职工的积极性和创造性，并学习“李川江先进榨油法”的经验，提高出油率，增加油源，为国家创造更多的财富。
    目前净化乡存在两种浪费食油现象：（一）生产用油全部以棉油、豆油甚至香油供应，为数甚巨。（二）农民普遍以黑豆、棉籽喂牲口，消耗油源极大。因此，我们建议：（一）对生产用油尽可能找废机油和其他非食油代替，根据各地反映，废机油既好使又省钱，很受农民欢迎。（二）提倡农民试以饼作饲料，用算细账方法，让农民知道，养一头牲口，一年喂豆六百斤，若以饼代替，无形中多得六十斤油，既能解决自家的吃油问题，又可出卖，帮助缺油户，一举两得。这可以先在农业生产社作典型试喂，待证明效果良好，然后推广。
