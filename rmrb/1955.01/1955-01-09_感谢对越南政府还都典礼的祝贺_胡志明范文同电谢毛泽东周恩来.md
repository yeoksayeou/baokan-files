Xinhua News Agency, January 8th:

Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and Pham Van Dong, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, sent telegrams to Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, and Zhou Enlai, Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs, to thank them for their congratulations on the return of the Vietnamese government to Hanoi. The telegram reads as follows:

To Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China:
To Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:

The warm congratulations of the Chinese people, the government of the People's Republic of China, and Chinese comrades on the return of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to Hanoi have deeply moved and inspired the entire Vietnamese people.

We always remember that during the War of Resistance, the Vietnamese people received the sympathy and support of the Chinese people. We firmly believe that in the current struggle for peace, reunification, independence, and democracy, as well as for the restoration of the economy and culture, the Vietnamese people will receive the enthusiastic assistance of the Chinese people.

With the solidarity and efforts of the Vietnamese people themselves, and with the sympathy and support of the people of fraternal countries and all peace-loving people around the world, the Vietnamese people's national liberation struggle will surely achieve complete victory.

We wish the Chinese people and the government of the People's Republic of China, under the leadership of Chairman Comrade and the Chinese Communist Party, greater and more significant achievements in the cause of building a socialist society and defending world peace.

	Ho Chi Minh
	Pham Van Dong
