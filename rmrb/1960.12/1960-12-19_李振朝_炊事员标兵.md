    Li Zhenchao—Model Cook
    By our reporters Zi Kan, Rong Yun, Bing Kui

    The model deeds of Li Zhenchao, a veteran Red Army soldier and model cook in Fuping County, Hebei Province, are well-known in the surrounding area. In recent days, with admiration, we visited this veteran Red Army fighter who diligently and wholeheartedly serves the people's cause at the Mapeng Production Team in Chengnanzhuang Commune.

    It was breakfast time when we arrived at the Mapeng Production Team. This old Red Army soldier greeted us with a smile, mumbled something, and continued to busy himself serving rice and dishing out vegetables. He was always smiling, his wrinkles covering his entire face, appearing so simple and kind. After finishing his work, he stood by the table with his hands tucked under his clean white work clothes, watching people eat with relish, the smile lines on his face deepening. …

    Another Glorious Post

    Li Zhenchao, this old Red Army soldier and veteran Party member, is already sixty-three years old this year. He was born into a poor peasant family in Henan Province. In 1934, he resolutely embarked on the revolutionary path, shouldering a gun and joining the Red Army. He fought in the north and south for fifteen years, until the final victory of the Liberation War.

    In 1949, the country was liberated, and Li Zhenchao, in his fifties, retired to Mapeng Village, a remote and deep mountain valley, to settle down. From then on, he plunged into the struggle to build socialism.

    In 1958, with the birth of the people's commune, public welfare undertakings developed vigorously. Public canteens were set up. Running the canteen well was a major concern for the people's livelihood and a heavy burden. Who could shoulder it? Who could make the commune members feel at ease? The village first selected seventeen people, and after much deliberation, Li Zhenchao was unanimously chosen as the first choice.

    The people's trust in him evoked a happy memory: In the past, he risked his life to kill enemies, defeated domestic and foreign enemies, and won the independence and liberation of the motherland. Today, working in the people's commune canteen, ensuring that the commune members eat well and have enough to eat, engaging in production, producing more grain, and quickly changing the backward situation of poverty and blankness in the motherland—isn't this again working in the most needed position in the motherland's construction cause?

    From the first day he walked into the canteen, Li Zhenchao devoted his entire body and mind to it, just as he had defended his position in the past. The commune members said, "The canteen is more important than Lao Li's home; he is always thinking about the canteen day and night." One night, it was late, and Li Zhenchao hadn't fallen asleep. He nudged his wife awake and said, "These days, people are eating vegetable buns from the canteen that don't taste refreshing. What do you think is the matter?" His wife, awakened by Li Zhenchao, was half annoyed and half loving, complaining, "You've been busy all day, and your mind is still in the canteen when you sleep at night…" Li Zhenchao interrupted her before she could finish, saying, "I'm a cook, where else should I put my mind if not in the canteen?" His wife knew his temper; he wouldn't be satisfied until he resolved the problem. After a moment of silence, she said, "It must be the way it's made! You need to use lukewarm water to leaven the dough, squeeze the water out of the vegetables, and then mix them into the dough." Li Zhenchao thought his wife was right, felt relieved, and then fell into a deep sleep.

    The True Colors of the Red Army

    More than ten years of revolutionary struggle have tempered Li Zhenchao like pure steel. He often said, "The enemy's planes and cannons couldn't defeat us, so what is difficulty!" Yes, in the face of this revolutionary veteran, difficulties cannot hold him back. Since the establishment of the canteen, he has overcome countless challenges, big and small. During this year's summer harvest, commune members worked hard to harvest wheat, and the canteen had to prepare four meals a day and deliver food and water. Some women cooks developed a fear of difficulty. Li Zhenchao thought, "This is the time to seize the autumn harvest and compete for wheat. If the food isn't good, it will affect production. Can't we overcome this little difficulty?" To strengthen everyone's courage to overcome difficulties, he told them stories of the Long March and the long-term goals of communist construction while working. Everyone was deeply moved by listening to him, and their enthusiasm for work greatly increased.

    This revolutionary veteran, who is wholeheartedly serving the people, has received the respect and love of the Party and the people in every way. The Fuping County Party Committee and the Chengnanzhuang Commune Party Committee have repeatedly suggested to the Mapeng Production Team's Party branch that they should take care of him more and not let him work too hard. However, whenever Branch Secretary Zhang Fengcai mentioned this matter to him and prepared to transfer one or two people to help with the canteen work, it would always make Comrade Li Zhenchao unhappy. He said: The Party calls for strengthening the front line. Production is so busy now. Putting people in the canteen to cook does not conform to the Party's policies. Finally, in order to reduce the burden on Comrade Li Zhenchao, Branch Secretary Zhang Fengcai often helped out in the kitchen early in the morning and late at night to share some of his labor.

    Frugal Style

    "Grain is the most precious treasure," a point that the veteran Red Army soldier who went through the Long March understands most deeply. He keeps any leftover dry food or crumbs that fall off dry food. If any of the commune members waste a little grain, it hurts him like cutting off a piece of his flesh. Once, while eating noodles, a young commune member, Xu Xiaoqin, casually spilled the remaining mouthful of noodle soup on the ground.

    This made Li Zhenchao's heart ache. He stopped Xu Xiaoqin and said, "Girl, there are noodles in the soup. If you don't eat it, you can pour it into a bucket to feed the pigs. Why waste it like this?" He naturally thought of the stories of the Red Army soldiers enduring hunger and cold on the Long March and used these vivid facts to educate the younger generation.

    Li Zhenchao is also a good Party member who takes the lead in implementing the Party's policies. Li Zhenchao noticed that some households were buying less food at the end of the month. What was going on? It turned out that they hadn't planned carefully, being loose at the beginning and tight at the end. This matter gave Li Zhenchao a new inspiration: To implement the canteen's policy of planned and economical use of grain well, it's not enough to just issue food tickets to the commune members; we must also help the commune members specifically plan their grain consumption. So, he discussed it with the Party branch secretary and came up with a way to hang meal cards. Based on the amount of grain supplied to each commune member, how to arrange each meal was written on the card, and the cooks prepared the food according to the card. This truly achieved planned use of grain, with everything clear in mind. Not only could every household eat their fill, but they also had a surplus.

    The saying goes: People who cook in the kitchen never go hungry. But this saying doesn't apply to Li Zhenchao. He never takes a drop of oil or a grain of rice from the canteen for himself. He keeps whatever food is left over, no matter how little. He doesn't even eat a little bit of vegetable soup himself. He strictly demands himself in every way and treats everyone equally, adhering to principles. He is even stricter with his family, neighbors, and commune cadres. Once, when the canteen had good food, Li Zhenchao's nephew wanted to buy an extra portion. Li Zhenchao angrily said, "Why are you buying more when you've already bought some?" That's how uncompromising he is. Li Zhenchao, this old hero who dedicated his youth and prime to the revolutionary cause, has now raised a red flag on the living front, becoming a model for the cooks in Fuping, this old revolutionary base area, to learn from and catch up with. People say, "Li Zhenchao truly deserves to be called the people's servant."

    李振朝——炊事员标兵
    本报记者　子侃　荣运　炳奎
    河北省阜平县的炊事员标兵——老红军李振朝的模范事迹，在这一带远近闻名。近几天，我们怀着敬慕的心情，到城南庄公社麻棚生产队，访问了这位勤勤恳恳赤胆忠心为人民事业服务的老红军战士。
    正是吃早饭的时候，我们赶到了麻棚生产队。这位老红军笑着向我们打个招呼，嘴里不知说了句什么，就继续忙着盛饭打菜了。他总是微笑着，笑得皱纹布满整个面庞，显得那么纯朴、温厚。他忙完了工作，双手插在白净的工作服下面，就站在桌旁看着人们津津有味地吃饭，脸上的笑纹显得更深了。……
    又一个光荣的岗位
    李振朝，这位老红军、老党员，今年已经六十三岁了。他生在河南省一个贫农家庭里。1934年，他毅然决然地走上了革命的道路，扛起枪杆，参加了红军。南征北战十五年，一直战斗到解放战争的最后胜利。
    1949年全国解放了，年过半百的李振朝，复员到这个深山僻谷的麻棚村安家落户。从那时起，他又投入了建设社会主义的斗争。
    1958年，随着人民公社的诞生，公共福利事业有了蓬勃的发展。公共食堂办起来了。把食堂办好，这是关心群众生活的大事，是一副重担子。交给谁才能担得起来？交给谁才能使社员们放心？全村最先选出十七个人，十七个人中间挑来选去，最后一致通过的第一名，便是李振朝。
    群众对他的信任，却引起了他一场幸福的回忆：过去拼命杀敌，打败了国内外敌人，争得了祖国的独立解放；今天能在人民公社食堂里工作，让社员们吃得饱，吃得好，搞生产，多打粮，快些改变祖国一穷二白的落后面貌，这不又是在祖国建设事业中最需要的工作岗位上吗？
    李振朝从走进食堂第一天起，就像当年坚守阵地一样，把整个身心都放在了食堂。社员们说：“食堂胜过老李的家，白天黑夜总想着食堂里的事。”一天夜已深了，李振朝还没有睡着，他用手推醒了老伴，说：“这几天，人们吃着食堂里的菜馍馍不清口，你说是怎么回事？”老伴被李振朝推醒，半是气恼，半是疼爱，埋怨道：“白天忙了一天，夜里睡觉心还在食堂里……。”李振朝没等老伴说完，就接口说：“我是炊事员，不把心放在食堂里放在哪？”老伴知道他的脾气，解不开疙瘩不算完，稍沉了会儿才说：“那是作得不得法呗！要用半开水发面，把菜挤干了汤，再掺在面里就好了。”李振朝觉得老伴说的对，心里宽松了，这才沉沉地睡去。
    红军的本色
    十多年的革命斗争，把李振朝锻炼得像纯钢一样。他常说：“敌人的飞机大炮打不倒我们，困难算个啥！”是的，在这位革命前辈的面前，困难是绊不住脚的。从建立食堂以来，大大小小的难关不知闯过了多少。今年夏收时，社员们起早恋黑突击收麦，食堂里每天要作四次主副食，还得送饭送水，几个妇女炊事员产生了畏难情绪。李振朝想：“正是争秋夺麦的时候，伙食搞不好，就要影响生产，难道这点困难都不能克服？”为了坚定大家克服困难的勇气，他就一面干活，一面给大家讲长征时的故事，讲共产主义建设的远景。大家听了深受感动，工作积极性大大增加。
    这位赤胆忠心为人民服务的革命老前辈，处处受到了党和人民的尊敬和爱戴。中共阜平县委、城南庄公社党委曾多次向麻棚生产队党支部建议，要多多照顾他，不要太劳累了。可是每当支部书记张凤财向他提起这件事情，准备调一两个人来帮助食堂工作时，总要引起李振朝同志的不痛快。他说：党号召加强第一线，现在生产这样忙，把人放在食堂做饭，不符合党的政策。最后，为了减轻李振朝同志的负担，支部书记张凤财经常一早一晚去帮厨，以便替他分担一部分劳动。
    勤俭作风
    “粮食是宝中宝”，这一点，对经过长征的老红军是体会最深刻的。食堂里有时剩下一点干粮或是干粮掉下来的渣粒，他都要保存好。社员们谁要是糟蹋一点粮食，就像是割他身上的肉一样痛。一次吃面条，青年社员许小勤把吃剩下的一口面汤随手洒在地上。
    这下子可心疼坏了李振朝。他拉住许小勤说：“丫头，汤里边可有面呀，不吃了，可以倒在桶里喂猪，怎么就白白地把它糟蹋了？”他又很自然地想起了在长征路上，红军战士忍饥耐饿的故事，用这些活生生的事实来教育青年一代。
    李振朝也是带头贯彻执行党的政策的好党员。李振朝发现有的户到月底买的饭量就少了。怎么回事呢？原来是没有细安排，前松后紧。这件事，却给了李振朝一个新的启发：要把食堂计划用粮节约用粮政策执行得好，光给社员发了饭票还不行，还得帮助社员具体安排吃粮计划。于是他就找党支部书记研究，想出了挂饭牌的办法。根据每个社员的粮食供应数量，每顿如何安排都写在牌上，由炊事员按牌作饭。这样真正作到了计划用粮，胸中有数，家家户户不但能吃饱，还有了节余。
    俗语说：厨房里饿不着作饭的人。这句话对李振朝来说却是不适用的。他从不多沾食堂里的一滴油、一粒粮。剩下什么饭菜，不管多少，他都要保存好。即使是一点菜汤，他也不肯自己把它吃掉。他处处严格要求自己，对任何人坚持原则，一律相待。特别是家人近邻、社干部，对他们要求得更加严格。一次食堂吃好的，李振朝的内侄想多买一份。李振朝气呼呼地说：“已经买了为什么又来买？”他就是这样从不含糊。李振朝，这位为革命事业献出了青春和壮年的老英雄，今天又在生活战线上竖起了红旗，成为阜平这个革命老根据地里的炊事人员学赶的标兵。人们说：“李振朝真称得起是人民的勤务员”。
