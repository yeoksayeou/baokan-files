    The Origin of Seawater and Paleoceanography
    Liang Yuanbo, South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences

    Our working people have long utilized seawater for salt production and marine aquaculture, and recently have greatly expanded the scope of developing seawater resources. However, the treasures in seawater have not yet been fully exploited. For example, the nuclear energy contained in seawater remains completely untapped. Academician Dam, a Soviet scientist, once pointed out that the ocean will be humanity's future "gasoline depot." The energy released by the fusion of heavy hydrogen in one liter of seawater will be equal to burning 350 liters of gasoline. Therefore, possessing the seawater of the four oceans of the Earth is equivalent to having 1,400 oceans of gasoline. This is truly an inexhaustible source of energy. Where does the seawater, which so generously provides us with various resources, come from? What is its formation process, its development law, its age, and how are its constituent substances accumulated? For a long time, people have been considering these questions. These questions are not only of theoretical significance but also of great importance for the practice of ocean development. The science that studies these questions is "Paleoceanography," or "Historical Oceanography."

    The Origin and Age of Seawater

    In the past, it was hypothesized that the Earth's atmosphere contained a large amount of superheated water vapor in its primordial state. Later, this water vapor cooled and condensed, forming long periods of torrential rain that fell on the Earth's surface and then gathered into the low-lying ocean basins. During this long period of rain, the water washed away a large amount of material from the land, thus forming seawater and its salinity. Of course, rivers continued to carry salts from the land into the sea afterward, but the basic salinity of seawater was already present at the beginning. This hypothesis of seawater originating from "above" is called the "Residual Hypothesis."

    Initially, this hypothesis seemed irrefutable. Moreover, apart from some minor details on which some people raised different opinions, people could not find a better explanation.

    With the development of science, when many principles of oceanography transitioned from qualitative explanations to quantitative calculations, this hypothesis encountered some unsolvable problems.

    First, the problem arose with the relative masses of the hydrosphere and the atmosphere. According to the calculations of geochemists Rankama and Sahama, the mass of seawater on Earth is 230 times greater than the mass of the atmosphere. This means that the primordial atmosphere contained more than 200 times its current mass of water vapor. Would this not imply that the atmosphere was almost entirely composed of water vapor at that time? This is unreasonable. We have no evidence to indicate that a planet's atmosphere can contain such a large amount of water.

    Secondly, there is the issue of the age of seawater. When British scientist Joly calculated the amount of sodium ions carried into the sea by modern rivers each year, he found that even at the current rate, it would only take 89 million years for rivers to create the current salinity of the oceans. If we consider that the salinity of seawater was basically formed in the primordial period, and that the salinity has only slightly increased each year since then, then we can deduce that the age of seawater is even shorter, i.e., less than 89 million years. This is, of course, a fallacy. All conclusions of geology and paleontology certainly prove that seawater has existed for at least two billion years. Otherwise, it would be impossible to explain a series of major problems in the history of the Earth and the development of life.

    Finally, when geologists calculated the composition of the Earth's crust, they discovered an even larger "ocean" within the crust. Of course, water does not exist in a free state within the crust. It is combined in magma and the minerals of the crust. According to calculations, the volume of water in the upper crust reaches more than one-fifteenth. This is an extremely large number. If this extremely large amount of water had all flowed down from the atmosphere-surface, then the amount of water contained in the primordial atmosphere would have to be even more unreasonably large. The salts left in the ocean as it seeped underground would also have to be much more than what exists now. It is evident that the theory of seawater originating from "above" encounters insurmountable difficulties in quantitative calculations.

    When studying volcanic and hot spring activity, people discovered that the chemical composition of the gases and other substances discharged from the Earth's interior is very similar to the composition of certain substances in the ocean. For example, water vapor accounts for a large proportion of the gases discharged from the depths of the Earth. Geochemists know that these substances are also particularly "enriched" in the ocean, atmosphere, and the Earth's surface layer. So, people began to think, could seawater and certain substances in seawater be released from magma and the depths of the Earth's crust? At this time, geologists joined in the calculations, and the results showed that the total amount of water erupted by volcanoes on Earth each year reaches about 0.5 to 1 cubic kilometer (the value calculated by Dutch scholar Kuenen is slightly smaller). If we consider that the geotectonic activity and volcanic activity on the Earth's surface in the past were more intense than they are now, then the amount of water discharged from the Earth's interior in the past would have been sufficient to create the current ocean. In addition, the Earth's interior also discharged certain substances currently contained in seawater.

    This is the famous "Accretion Hypothesis" regarding the origin of seawater. This hypothesis is directly opposed to the "Residual Hypothesis." The "Residual Hypothesis" believes that the amount of water on Earth will gradually be consumed in the weathering and hydration of minerals, and most of it will also seep into the crust. The Earth will have a "desolate, moon-like appearance." However, the "Accretion Hypothesis" says: No! Things are not that bad. On the contrary, water and other substances are continuously released from the Earth's interior. The substances in the lower crust warm up due to the heat released during the decay of radioactive elements in the Earth, resulting in the formation of magma and the release of water vapor and other more volatile substances to the surface.

    The Tasks of Paleoceanography

    "Paleoceanography" has three main research methods: studying the stratification of marine sediments, the interstitial solutions of the seabed, and the composition of ancient marine microfossils.

    In the past decade, great progress has been made in using radioactive elements to determine the age of sedimentary layers. At the same time, marine geologists have also obtained increasingly long sediment core samples from the seabed. If these two are combined, it is not difficult to determine the age of each layer in the core. Theoretical studies have pointed out that the composition of sediments is a comprehensive reflection of various processes occurring in the ocean. Based on the mechanical composition of the sediments, people can infer the hydrodynamic conditions of the sea area in the past, thereby inferring the past seabed topography and structure. The second is the study of interstitial solutions, which has only recently begun to receive attention. During the International Geophysical Year, the Soviet research vessel "Vityaz" made important achievements in the study of seabed interstitial solutions in the northwestern Pacific Ocean and expanded the scope of research in this area. We now know that the interstitial solutions contained in each sedimentary layer often have subtle differences, which roughly reflect the seawater conditions during the deposition of sediments. Based on the analysis of interstitial solutions, we can learn about the chemical composition of various regions of the sea in the past and the ratios of various components in the seawater, etc. Finally, the research and analysis of biological fossils in the sedimentary layers will give us a concept of the marine life activities at that time.

    Just as the research of historical geology and paleogeography has greatly promoted the development of geological and geographical sciences, the research of "Paleoceanography" will also enable us to have a deeper understanding of various aspects of modern oceans, enable us to explain the origin and significance of certain special factors in modern oceans, and ultimately help to fully grasp the laws of ocean development and utilize these laws in practical work.

    For example, the formation of certain fish schools is greatly related to paleoceanographic conditions. Some ancient coastal migratory fish schools still migrate along the submerged ancient coastlines to this day, a situation that has been pointed out by researchers more than once. This type of law provided by "Paleoceanography" research can bring benefits to our fisheries production. The situation is similar in other ocean-related issues.

    "Make the past serve the present" is our guiding principle. The research of paleoceanography follows this correct direction and will surely promote the faster leap forward of China's marine science.

    海水的来源和古海洋学
    中国科学院南海海洋研究所　梁元博
    我国劳动人民很早以来就利用海水晒盐，养殖海洋生物，近来更大大扩展了开发海水资源的范围。但是，海水里的宝藏还远没有被充分开发。例如海水里蕴藏着的核能，就完全没有被触动。苏联科学家达姆院士曾经指出，海洋，将是人类未来的“汽油库”。一升海水里的重氢在聚变中所放出的能量，将等于燃烧三百五十升汽油。因此，人们拥有地球上四个大洋的海水，就等于有了一千四百个大洋的汽油。这真正是取之不尽用之不竭的能量来源。这样慷慨地供给我们以各种富源的海水，究竟是从哪里来的呢？它的形成过程是怎样的，它的发展规律又是怎样的？它的年龄有多大了？它所含有的物质，又是怎样聚积起来的？许久以来，人们就在考虑着这样一些问题。这些问题不仅具有理论意义，而且对于开发海洋的实践，也是很重要的。研究这些问题的科学，就是“古海洋学”，或称为“历史海洋学”。
    海水的来源及其年龄
    从前，人们设想在原始时候，地球的大气圈里含有大量过热的水蒸汽，以后这些水蒸汽遇冷凝结，形成长时期的暴雨降落地表，再汇集到低洼的海洋盆地里去。在这长期的暴雨中，水分把陆地上的大量物质冲刷出来，于是形成了海水及其盐分。当然，以后河流还在继续把陆地上的盐类搬运到海里去，但是海水基本的盐分在开始时就已经存在着了。这个海水从“上面”产生的假说，就叫做“残留假说”。
    起初看来，这个假说是无可非议的。而且除了在某些细节问题上有人提出不同意见以外，人们确实也找不到更好的解释。
    随着科学的发展，海洋学上的许多原理从定性的解释进入定量的计算时，这个设想就碰到了一些不能解决的问题。
    首先，问题是出在水圈和大气圈的相对质量上。根据地球化学家蓝伽马和萨哈马的计算，地球上海水的质量比大气圈的质量要大二百三十倍。这就是说原始时候的大气圈包含着比它现有质量大二百多倍的水蒸汽。这样岂不是说当时大气圈几乎全部是由水汽组成的吗？这是不合理的。我们没有任何证据表明一个行星的蒙气可以含有这样大量的水分。
    其次是海水的年龄问题，英国科学家卓利在计算现代河流每年把钠离子搬运入海的数量时，发现即使按照现有的速度，由河流造成大洋现存的盐分也只需要八千九百万年。如果考虑到海水的盐分在原始时候已基本形成，以后每年盐分只不过有少量的增加，那末可以推论海水的年龄还要短得多，即不足八千九百万年。这当然是一个谬论。地质学和古生物学的所有结论，都确实证明海水的存在至少有二十亿年。否则无法解释地史学和生物发展的一系列重大问题。
    最后，地质学家们在计算地壳的成分时，发现地壳内还有一个更大的“大洋”。当然，在地壳内水分不是以游离的状态存在的。它化合在岩浆和地壳的矿物中，根据计算，水分在上层地壳内的体积达到十五分之一以上。这是一个极大的数目。如果这极其大量的水都是从大气圈——地表跑下去的，那末原始时候大气圈所含的水量，就要大得更不合理。它在渗入地下时留在大洋中的盐类，也要比现有的多得多。可见，海水从“上面”生成的理论在定量计算方面碰上了无法克服的困难。
    人们在研究火山和温泉的活动时，发现从地球内部排出的气体和其他物质的化学组成，同海洋中某些物质的组成很相似。例如，从地球深部排出的气体中，水蒸汽占了极大比例。地球化学家们知道，这几种物质在海洋、大气圈和地球表层也正是“富集”得特别多的。于是人们就想到，海水和海水里的某些物质，会不会都是从岩浆里、从地壳深处释放出来的呢？这时地质学家们就加入来计算，结果算出地球上现有的火山每年喷出的水量总共达二分之一到一立方公里左右（荷兰学者奎年算出的数值要少一些）。如果考虑到过去时期地球表面上的地槽活动和火山活动比现在剧烈，那末在过去的时期内，从地球内部排出的水量完全足够生成现在的大洋。除此以外，地球内部还附带排出了海水中现在含有的某些物质。
    这就是海水来源问题上的有名的“增生假说”。这个假说同“残留假说”刚好针锋相对。“残留假说”认为地球上的水量将逐渐消耗在矿物的风化和水合作用上，大部分还将渗漏到地壳里去，地球将具有“死寂的、像月球般惨淡的外貌”。可是
  “增生假说”却说：不！事情并没有这么坏。恰恰相反，水分和其他物质正是源源不绝地从地球内部释放出来。地壳下层的物质因接受地球放射性元素衰变时放出的热量而增温，结果形成岩浆并把水蒸汽和其他较易挥发的物质放出到地表上来。
    古海洋学的任务
    “古海洋学”有三个主要的研究方法，这就是研究海洋沉积物的层理、海洋的底质溶液和古海洋微化石的成分。
    近十年来，利用放射性元素测定沉积层年龄的工作取得了很大的进展。同时，海洋地质学家也从海底取得了愈来愈长的底质地层柱。如果把这两者结合起来，不难测定底质柱中各层的年龄。理论的研究指出，沉积物的成分是海洋中所发生的各种作用的总的反映。根据沉积物的机械成分，人们可以推知过去时期海域的水动力情况，从而推论出过去时期的海底地形和结构。其次是关于底质溶液的研究，这方面的研究是近年来才开始给予重视的。在国际地球物理年间，苏联《勇士号》考察船对太平洋西北部海底底质溶液的研究已经取得重要的结果，并且开拓了这方面的研究范围。现在我们知道，各个沉积层中所包含着的底质溶液往往有着细微的差别，它大致反映着沉积物淀积时期的海水状况。根据底质溶液的分析，我们有可能获悉海中各区在过去时期内的化学成分，和海水中各种组分的比值等。最后，对沉积层中生物化石的研究分析，将使我们对当时的海洋生命活动获得一个概念。
    正如地史学和古地理学的研究大大促进了地质地理科学的发展一样，“古海洋学”的研究也将使我们对现代海洋各方面的现象有更深刻的了解，使我们能够解释现代海洋中某些特殊因素的起源和意义，最后并有助于全面掌握海洋的发展规律并在实际工作中利用这种规律。
    例如，某些鱼群的形成就和古海洋情况有极大关系。有些古代沿岸回游的鱼群到现在仍然沿着淹没了的古代海岸线回游，这种情况已不止一次被研究者指出过了。“古海洋学”的研究所提供的这一类规律，就能给我们的渔业生产带来好处。在海洋的其他问题上，情形也是如此。
    “古为今用”是我们的方针。古海洋学的研究遵循着这个正确的方向，一定会促使我国的海洋科学更快地向前跃进。
