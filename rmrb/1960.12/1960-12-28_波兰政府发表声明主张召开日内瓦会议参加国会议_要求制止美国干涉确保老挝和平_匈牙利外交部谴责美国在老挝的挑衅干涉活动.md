Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, December 27th. The Government of the Polish People's Republic issued a statement on the 26th regarding the situation in Laos, advocating for an emergency meeting of the nations participating in the 1954 Geneva Conference.

The statement pointed out that the Government of the Polish People's Republic is observing the development of the Laotian situation with increasing concern. The development of the situation in Laos threatens the security of Southeast Asia and world peace. The statement said, "This change in the Laotian situation is the result of interference by the United States and other Southeast Asia Treaty Organization countries, opposing Prince Souvanna Phouma's government's policy of neutrality and national harmony in accordance with the will of all the Laotian people."

The statement said that despite the demands of the legitimate government of Laos for the United States to stop supporting the Phoumi Nosavan rebel faction, the United States continues to openly interfere in the internal affairs of Laos, providing weapons to the rebels and sending personnel to directly participate in military operations. All actions by the United States and Thailand "clearly violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Laos, and blatantly violate the Geneva Accords. They have further strained relations between countries in the region, thereby seriously threatening Asian security and peace."

The statement pointed out that the Government of the Polish People's Republic, knowing the responsibilities it bears as a member of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Indochina, has long followed the development of the situation in Laos with unease and deep concern, especially the open interference from the outside world in Laotian affairs. Based on its rights as a member of the International Commission for Supervision and Control, Poland has repeatedly proposed preventative measures and actively strived to implement them.

The statement said: "The Polish delegation to the Laotian Commission strongly opposed and protested the decision to suspend the activities of the International Commission for Supervision and Control, and warned about the negative impact this decision might have on Laos itself and on the cause of peace in Indochina. In recent years, the development of the situation in Laos has proven the correctness of these warnings, but at the same time shows that all attempts to impose a rule supported by outside forces on the Laotian people have made it impossible for the situation in the country to achieve any stability."

The statement said that the Polish government, knowing its responsibilities as a member of the Indochina Commission and deeply concerned about the maintenance of peace, demands that the United States and its allies immediately stop interfering in the internal affairs of Laos, and demands that all peace-loving countries take effective measures to ensure that the people of Laos obtain peace.

The statement said that the Government of the Polish People's Republic believes that an emergency meeting of the nations participating in the 1954 Geneva Conference should be convened. This meeting should be convened as soon as possible to discuss the situation created in Laos, as well as the steps to be taken to stop the civil war, stop outside interference in the internal affairs of Laos, and ensure peace and security in the region.

The statement advocates that the International Commission for Supervision and Control should resume its activities in consultation with the legitimate government of Laos.

The Government of the Polish People's Republic believes that the existence of Laos as an independent, democratic, and neutral country is necessary to guarantee peace in that part of the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 23rd. The Hungarian newspaper *People's Freedom* published today a statement by the Hungarian Foreign Ministry on the Laotian situation, pointing out that the events that have occurred in Laos in recent days clearly demonstrate the policy of open and provocative interference pursued by US imperialism and its servants.

The statement reviewed the Geneva Accords and pointed out that Laos' pursuit of a neutral policy is entirely in line with the basic interests of the Laotian people and has been unanimously approved by the Laotian people. However, the US government, disregarding the provisions of relevant international agreements and declarations, has conspired from the beginning to support forces in Laos that favor deviating from the neutral policy in order to come to power. The United States has consistently attempted to drag Laos into the aggressive Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in order to establish US bases in Laos and turn Laos into a military corridor.

The statement said that as a result of the US government's subversive activities, a situation has emerged in Laos that seriously threatens peace in Southeast Asia.

The statement concluded by stating that the Government of the Hungarian People's Republic strongly condemns the anti-peace activities carried out by the US government and its servants in Laos and the open interference in the internal affairs of Laos. The US government must bear responsibility for the aggressive policy that has provoked the civil war in Laos and its consequences.

    波兰政府发表声明主张召开日内瓦会议参加国会议
    要求制止美国干涉确保老挝和平
    匈牙利外交部谴责美国在老挝的挑衅干涉活动
    新华社华沙27日电　波兰人民共和国政府26日就老挝局势发表声明，主张紧急召开1954年日内瓦会议参加国会议。
    声明指出，波兰人民共和国政府以日益忧虑的心情注视着老挝事态的发展。老挝的事态发展威胁着东南亚的安全和世界和平。声明说，“老挝局势的这种变化，是美国和其它东南亚条约组织国家进行干涉、反对富马亲王政府根据全体老挝人民的意志执行中立和民族和睦的政策的结果。”
    声明说，美国不顾老挝合法政府对美国停止支持富米·诺萨万叛乱分子的要求，继续公开干涉老挝的内政，向叛乱分子提供武器和派遣直接参加军事行动的人员。美国和泰国的一切行动“明显地侵犯了老挝的主权和领土完整，公然破坏了日内瓦协议。它们使这个地区的国家之间的关系更加紧张了，从而严重地威胁着亚洲的安全与和平”。
    声明指出，波兰人民共和国政府，由于知道它作为印度支那国际监察和监督委员会的成员所担负的责任，长期以来一直以不安和深切忧虑的心情注视着老挝的形势发展，特别是外界对老挝事务的公开干涉。波兰根据其作为国际监察和监督委员会成员的权利，曾一再提出预防性措施，并积极努力使这些措施得到实施。
    声明说：“老挝委员会波兰代表团曾强烈反对并抗议关于中止国际监察和监督委员会活动的决定，同时就这个决定对老挝本身和对印度支那和平事业可能造成的消极影响提出警告。近年来，老挝事态的发展证明了这些警告的正确性，但是同时表明，要把受外界支持的统治强加于老挝人民的一切企图，已使这个国家的局势不可能得到任何稳定。”
    声明说，波兰政府由于知道它作为印度支那委员会成员所承担的责任，并深切关心和平的维持，要求美国及其盟国立即停止干涉老挝内政，并要求所有爱好和平的国家采取有效措施，以便确保老挝人民得到和平。
    声明说，波兰人民共和国政府认为，应该紧急召开1954年日内瓦会议参加国会议。这个会议应当早日召开，以便讨论在老挝造成的局势，以及讨论为制止内战、制止外界对老挝内政的干涉和确保这个地区的和平与安全所要采取的步骤。
    声明主张国际监察和监督委员会应当同老挝合法政府进行协商，恢复活动。
    波兰人民共和国政府认为，老挝作为一个独立、民主和中立的国家而存在，是为保证世界的那部分地区的和平所必需的。
    据新华社布达佩斯23日电　匈牙利《人民自由报》今天刊登的匈牙利外交部就老挝事件发表声明指出，最近几天在老挝发生的事件清楚地证明了美帝国主义及其仆从所奉行的公开挑衅干涉政策。
    声明回顾了日内瓦协议后指出，老挝执行中立政策是完全符合老挝人民的基本利益的，并且得到老挝人民的一致赞成。但是，美国政府不顾有关国际协定和声明的规定，从一开始就阴谋支持老挝脱离中立政策的势力当权。美国一直企图把老挝拉入侵略性的东南亚条约组织，以便在老挝建立美国基地，把老挝变成军事走廊。
    声明说，由于美国政府颠复活动的结果，老挝出现了严重威胁东南亚和平的局势。
    声明最后指出，匈牙利人民共和国政府严厉谴责美国政府及其仆从们在老挝所进行的反和平活动和对老挝内政的公开干涉。美国政府要为在老挝挑起内战的侵略政策及其后果承担责任。
