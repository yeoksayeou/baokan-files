Xinhua News Agency, New York, 8th Dispatch: According to TASS from New York, the normal daily life of New York was interrupted on the 7th by the miserable wailing of many sirens, as the U.S. Civil and Defense Mobilization Office used the 19th anniversary of the fascist Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor to conduct new activities inciting atomic hysteria.

The Pentagon finds it increasingly difficult to convince ordinary Americans that someone is preparing to invade them. A movement against increasing donations for the arms race is developing in the United States. Precisely because of this, U.S. officials have had to artificially create nervousness among residents more frequently with sirens, drill alerts, and demonstrations on protection from atomic attacks.

The scale of the action on the 7th was very large. Bourgeois newspapers reported with admiration that the strange concert that began at 11 a.m. in New York featured the sounds of 731 sirens. New York City police, doctors, postal workers, and transportation workers were all put on combat readiness. Even pastors were mobilized, ready to deliver farewell addresses to "bombing victims." Equipment from the Civil and Defense Mobilization Office was displayed throughout the city. Booklets about atomic warfare were distributed to travelers at all stations and airports.

This indecent activity of the merchants of death aroused the anger of ordinary Americans. A special committee was established in New York to protest the actions of the Civil and Defense Mobilization Office. The committee distributed an appeal saying that this kind of training is accustoming children to waiting for war instead of fighting to prevent it, creating psychological abnormalities in children's minds.

Students at many high schools in New York held demonstrations on the 7th to protest the incitement of atomic hysteria. The "College Students for a Ban on Civil Defense Training" organization and "College Students for Peace Action" distributed thousands of pamphlets and leaflets among students, exposing the provocative nature of the actions of the American militarists. Dozens of parents went to the New York City Board of Education on the 7th to protest the incitement of war hysteria among students.

    纽约居民抗议制造战争气氛
    美国政府煽动原子狂举行战争警报演习
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：纽约每天的正常生活在7日那天被很多汽笛的凄惨的号叫声打断了，因为美国民间和国防动员署利用法西斯日本袭击珍珠港十九周年的机会，进行新的煽动原子狂的活动。
    五角大楼越来越难使普通的美国人相信，有人准备侵犯他们。在美国反对增加进行军备竞赛捐税的运动正在发展着。正因为如此，美国官方人士才不得不更经常地用汽笛、演习警报和保护不受原子侵袭的示范训练来人为地使居民神经紧张。
    7日的行动规模很大。资产阶级报纸带着赞赏的口吻报道说，纽约上午十一点开始的奇怪的演奏会上有七百三十一种汽笛的响声。纽约市区警察、医生、邮电工作人员和交通工作人员都进行了战斗准备。甚至牧师也被动员了，他们随时准备向“轰炸牺牲者”致临别词。在城市各地展览了民间和国防动员署的设备。在所有的车站和飞机场向旅客们散发有关原子战争的小册子。
    死亡商人这种不体面的勾当引起了普通美国人的愤怒。纽约成立了抗议民间和国防动员署行动的特别委员会。委员会散发了呼吁书，呼吁书中说，这种训练是使儿童们习惯于等待战争，而不去为防止战争进行斗争，在儿童的脑子里制造心理的不正常。
    纽约许多中学的学生7日举行了示威，抗议煽动原子狂。“大学生争取禁止民防训练”组织和“大学生争取和平行动”在学生中间散发了几千本小册子和传单，揭露美国黩武主义者的行动的挑衅性。几十名家长7日前往纽约教育局，抗议在学生们中间煽动战争狂。
