Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 22nd: The Laotian Fighting Forces Radio today published a commentary condemning Thailand's reactionary Sarit Thanarat ruling clique, under the instigation of the United States, for intensifying its collusion with the traitorous Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum Na Champassak group to plot military aggression in the area north of Vientiane and expand the war of aggression against Laos.

The broadcast cited a report from an American news agency stating that Thai Prime Minister Sarit Thanarat, between December 16th and 20th, had met with Phoumi Nosavan and Boun Oum Na Champassak in Nong Khai (a Thai border city near Vientiane on the south bank of the Mekong River) to conspire and formulate a plan for military activities in the area north of Vientiane. Senior Thai military officers and military experts are already prepared to be stationed in Nong Khai for a long period in order to coordinate activities with the Phoumi-Boun Oum group. The radio said that Thai aircraft are also constantly transporting weapons, ammunition, and military supplies from Bangkok to Vientiane.

The radio said that according to reports from the northeastern region of Thailand, the command headquarters in this region has ordered a portion of its infantry and paratroopers to be disguised as troops of the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous group and sent to the north of Vientiane to cooperate with the Phoumi-Boun Oum troops in combat.

The radio emphasized that the above actions by the Thai authorities once again prove their preparation to expand the war of aggression against Laos.

The broadcast said that all Laotian people resolutely denounce this blatant act of aggression by the Thai reactionaries. They must bear full responsibility for the consequences of this disgraceful act of aggression.

    新华社河内22日电　寮国战斗部队电台今天发表评论，谴责泰国乃沙立反动统治集团在美国指使下，加紧勾结富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞叛国集团，策划在万象北面地区进行军事侵略活动，扩大对老挝的侵略战争。
    广播援引美国通讯社的消息说，泰国总理乃沙立在12月16日到20日期间，曾到廊开（在万象附近、湄公河南岸的泰国边境城市）同富米·诺萨万、文翁·纳占巴塞会晤，阴谋制定一项在万象北面地区的军事活动计划。泰国高级军官和军事专家已经准备长期驻在廊开，以便同富米—文翁集团配合活动。电台说，泰国飞机还不断地把武器、弹药和军用物资由曼谷运到万象。
    电台说，据来自泰国东北部地区的消息透露，这个地区的指挥部已经命令一部分步兵和伞兵，改装为富米—文翁叛国集团的军队，到万象北面同富米—文翁的军队配合作战。
    电台强调指出，泰国当局的上述行动，再次证明它们准备扩大对老挝的侵略战争。
    广播说，全体老挝人民坚决控诉泰国反动派这种明目张胆的侵略罪行。对于这种可耻的侵略行为所造成的后果，必须由它们全部承担。
