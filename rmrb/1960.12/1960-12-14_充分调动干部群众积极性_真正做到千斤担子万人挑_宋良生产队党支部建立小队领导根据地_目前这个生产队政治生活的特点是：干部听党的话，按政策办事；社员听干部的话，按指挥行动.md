    The Party Branch of the Songliang Production Team Establishes a Leadership Base in Small Teams
    The current characteristics of political life in this production team are: cadres listen to the Party and act according to policies; members listen to cadres and act according to instructions

    (Our report) The Party Branch of the Songliang Production Team of the Sanlei People's Commune in Minqin County, Gansu Province, has developed a thorough and meticulous work style, established a "leadership base" in the small teams, correctly implemented the Party's policies, transformed the Party's policies into conscious actions of the masses, and promoted continuous leaps forward in various productions.

    The Songliang Production Team has 280 households and eight production teams. The 32 cadres of the production team and small teams are mostly from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds, and half of them have participated in work. After the rural areas were communized in 1958, these cadres lacked organizational and leadership experience, the small team leaders did not fully grasp the methods of participating in production and leading production, and were not good at arming the masses with the Party's policies and mobilizing the masses. Therefore, how to mobilize the enthusiasm of all cadres, truly achieve "a thousand jin burden, ten thousand people to shoulder," so that the Party's policies are correctly implemented among the masses, transform the Party's policies into conscious actions of the masses, and promote continuous leaps forward in various tasks, became the key issue that the Songliang Production Team Party Branch urgently needed to solve. The five members of the Party Branch Committee were determined to find solutions. Li Dequan, the Party Branch Secretary, participated in the land reform. He proposed establishing a "leadership base" for the branch, going deep into the masses like during the land reform, understanding the situation, correctly implementing the Party's policies, solving problems in a down-to-earth manner, and leading production diligently. The Party Branch Committee fully discussed this suggestion and decided to establish a "leadership base" for the branch, and rely on this "leadership base" to train cadres, educate the masses, and correctly implement the Party's policies. The specific method is: all work, from formulating targets, proposing measures, to organizing implementation and summarizing experience, should first be piloted in the "leadership base," summarizing leadership experience, improving leadership level, and more effectively guiding the work of the entire team.

    The "leadership base" of the Songliang Production Team Party Branch was established in the third team of this production team. This team has a total of 53 households, of which 48 are poor and lower-middle peasants. Branch Secretary Li Dequan had been a farmhand here since he was twelve years old, and has been working in this village since liberation, so he is very familiar with the masses here. This team has six Communist Party members, four Communist Youth League members, and more than 20 activists, and the level of mass awareness is generally high. Because they resolutely implement the Party's policies, production has leapt forward year after year, grain and cotton yields have increased year by year, and the lives of the masses have been arranged in a solid manner.

    This year, in order to correctly implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, the Songliang Production Team Party Branch comprehensively planned the land and rationally arranged the labor force in the "leadership base." According to the requirements of the Commune Party Committee, they put forward the slogan of taking grain as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward, and planned the 456 mu of cultivated land in the third team. In order to ensure that measures are implemented in the fields and responsibilities are assigned to people, they handed over this plan to the team members for serious discussion, and the branch revised the plan based on the opinions of the masses. The production team party branch planned the planting area of various crops and the labor force for various farm works for the entire team according to this ratio. This year, the Songliang Production Team planted more than 1,800 mu of grain crops and more than 700 mu of cotton. More than half of the land was intercropped and re-cropped, the planting area of cash crops and vegetables was expanded, and 82% of the labor force was concentrated to strengthen the field management of grain and cotton crops. Due to the rational layout of production and the proper arrangement of labor, production continued to leap forward. In the case of a prolonged drought and the inability of the river water to guarantee irrigation this year, they used well water to irrigate more than 1,100 mu of summer fields in the entire team more than twice, winning a bumper harvest.

    The establishment of the "leadership base" of the Songliang Production Team Party Branch for more than two years has brought three major benefits to the branch's leadership work.

    First, by establishing a "leadership base," the policy level of production team and small team cadres has been improved, and they can better implement the Party's policies. Most cadres have not only learned to do ideological work, but also explored a set of experiences in implementing policies and creatively leading production in practice, changing the general leadership style. Branch Secretary Li Dequan adopted the method of "doing everything himself, showing others how to do it, summarizing after doing it, and discussing experiences together" in the "leadership base." When studying work, he not only solved specific problems, but also studied the Party's policies; when assigning work, he not only explained the tasks, but also explained the specific methods and policy boundaries; when summarizing work, he not only checked the completion status, but also checked the implementation of policies. In this way, he quickly cultivated a group of good cadres who can participate in production and lead production, can care for and care for people, and are both commanders and combatants. The Party Branch has five handy branch committee members and sixteen work team leaders, forming a strong branch committee and team committee. The broad masses of members call them "good leaders in production, good housekeepers in life, good instructors in politics, and confidants in thought."

    Second, the establishment of a "leadership base" has promoted the persistence of production teams and small team cadres in policy learning. In more than two years of practice in the "leadership base," the Songliang Production Team Party Branch has deeply realized that in order to enable cadres to master policies well, they must let cadres study policies well. Otherwise, it will be difficult to formulate practical and reliable indicators. Therefore, they have always insisted on policy study. The slogan they put forward is: "The tighter the work, the harder the study." In addition to constantly studying the policies of various periods, they also constantly study Chairman Mao's works such as "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, Attention to Working Methods." In actual work, they go up to attend meetings to listen to policies, implement them immediately after the meeting, and adhere to eating, living, working, and discussing with the members, going deep into the masses, understanding the situation, solving problems, and improving work.

    Third, by establishing a "leadership base," a large number of activists who understand and implement policies have been cultivated, so that various policies can meet with the masses. Before implementing the instructions and resolutions of the Party Committee and deploying a new task, they first concentrate the branch committee members to study policies, analyze the situation, formulate plans, and mobilize all cadres and members to conduct full discussions and make models in the "leadership base." After summarizing the experience, the secretary stays at a point, using the "leadership base" as a staff headquarters to guide the overall work. Branch committee members and production team leaders went to various teams to pass on their experiences and treasures, adopting the method of contracting propaganda, contracting ideological education, contracting the training of activists, contracting the transmission of advanced experience, contracting the implementation of policies, contracting production, contracting life, and contracting everything to the end to promote production. In the process of summarizing and promoting advanced experience, the entire team has cultivated more than 110 activists, who have become the backbone of the Party Branch in correctly implementing the Party's various policies.

    Relying on the "leadership base" to implement the Party's policies and improve leadership methods, the Songliang Production Team Party Branch has formed a lively and vigorous political situation among cadres and members. The prominent characteristics of political life in this production team are: cadres listen to the Party and act according to policies; members listen to cadres and act according to instructions; cadres and members are of one mind and one heart, saying they will do it and doing it to the end.

    充分调动干部群众积极性　真正做到千斤担子万人挑
    宋良生产队党支部建立小队领导根据地
    目前这个生产队政治生活的特点是：干部听党的话，按政策办事；社员听干部的话，按指挥行动
    本报讯　中共甘肃省民勤县三雷人民公社宋良生产队支部，发扬深入细致的工作作风，在小队建立“领导根据地”，正确贯彻党的方针政策，把党的政策变为群众自觉的行动，推动各项生产不断跃进。
    宋良生产队有二百八十户，八个生产小队。生产队和小队的三十二名干部，大多出身于贫农和下中农，有一半人参加过工作。1958年，农村实现公社化后，由于这批干部还缺乏组织领导经验，小队长一级干部没有完全掌握参加生产领导生产的方法，不善于用党的政策武装群众，发动群众。因此，如何调动全体干部的积极性，真正做到“千斤担子万人挑”，使党的各项政策正确地贯彻到群众中去，把党的政策变为群众自觉的行动，推动各项工作不断跃进，就成为宋良生产队党支部亟需解决的关键问题。党支部的五个委员决心要寻找解决问题的措施。支部书记李得全参加过土地改革，他提出应建立支部“领导根据地”，要像土改时期一样深入群众，了解情况，正确贯彻党的方针政策，踏踏实实解决问题、勤勤恳恳领导生产。党支部委员会充分讨论了这个意见，决定建立支部“领导根据地”，并依靠这个“领导根据地”培养干部、教育群众，正确贯彻党的政策。具体方法是：一切工作，从制订指标、提出措施，到组织实施、总结经验，都首先在“领导根据地”进行试点，总结领导经验，提高领导水平，更有效地指导全队工作。
    宋良生产队党支部“领导根据地”，建立在这个生产队的第三小队。这个小队共五十三户，其中贫农下中农就占四十八户。支部书记李得全从十二岁起就在这里做长工，解放后又一直在这个村工作，对这里的群众十分熟悉。这个小队有六名共产党员，四名共青团员和二十多名积极分子，群众觉悟程度一般都较高。由于他们坚决贯彻党的政策，生产连年跃进，粮棉产量逐年上升，群众生活安排得扎扎实实。
    今年，宋良生产队党支部为了正确贯彻以农业为基础的方针，在“领导根据地”全面规划土地，合理安排劳力。他们根据公社党委的要求，提出以粮为纲，全面跃进的口号，将第三小队的四百五十六亩耕地进行了规划。为了使措施落实到田，责任落实到人，他们将这个规划交给小队社员认真讨论，支部又根据群众意见修改了规划。生产队党支部按照这个比例规划了全队各类作物播种面积和各项农活的劳力。今年，宋良生产队共播种粮食作物一千八百多亩，棉花七百多亩，其中一半以上的土地进行了间种、复种，扩大了经济作物和蔬菜的播种面积，集中了82％的劳动力，加强了粮食、棉花作物的田间管理。由于生产合理布局，劳力妥善安排，生产持续跃进，在今年久旱不雨、河水不能保证灌溉的情况下，他们利用井水将全队一千一百多亩夏田普遍浇灌二次以上，夺得了丰收的胜利。
    宋良生产队党支部“领导根据地”建立二年多来，给支部领导工作带来了三大好处。
    第一，通过建立“领导根据地”，提高了生产队和小队干部的政策水平，能更好地贯彻党的政策。多数干部既学会了做思想工作，又在实践中摸索出一套贯彻政策、创造性地领导生产的经验，改变了一般化的领导作风。支部书记李得全在“领导根据地”采取“事事自己干，带上别人看，干后就总结，大家谈经验”的办法，在研究工作时，既解决具体问题，又学习党的方针政策；在布置工作时，既交代任务，又交代具体办法和政策界限；在总结工作时，既检查完成情况，又检查政策的贯彻执行情况。这样，很快就培养出一批会参加生产领导生产、会关心体贴人，既是指挥员又是战斗员的好干部。党支部拥有五个得心应手的支部委员和十六个作业组长，形成了一个坚强的支部委员会和队委会。广大社员称他们为“生产上的好领导，生活上的好管家，政治上的好教员，思想上的贴心人”。
    第二，通过建立“领导根据地”，促进了生产队、小队干部坚持政策学习。宋良生产队党支部在“领导根据地”两年多来的实践中，深深体会到，要使干部掌握好政策，必须让干部学好政策。否则就很难订出切实可靠的指标。因此，他们始终坚持政策学习，他们提出的口号是：“工作越紧，学习越狠”，除经常钻研各个时期的方针政策外，还不断学习毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部的矛盾”、“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”等著作。在实际工作中，上去开会听政策，开会以后马上贯彻执行，并坚持与社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，深入群众，了解情况，解决问题，改进工作。
    第三，通过建立“领导根据地”，培养了大批了解政策、贯彻政策的积极分子，使各项政策和群众见面。他们在贯彻党委指示、决议，布置一项新的工作任务之前，都首先集中支部委员学习政策，分析情况，制订方案，发动全体干部、群众进行充分讨论，在“领导根据地”作出样板。总结经验以后，书记蹲点，以“领导根据地”为参谋部，指导全盘工作。支部委员、生产队长分赴各小队传经送宝，采取包宣传、包思想教育、包培养积极分子、包传授先进经验、包执行政策、包生产、包生活，一包到底的办法推动生产。在总结推广先进经验的过程中，全队培养出一百一十多名积极分子，成为党支部正确贯彻执行党的各项政策的骨干。
    宋良生产队党支部，依靠“领导根据地”贯彻党的政策，改进了领导方法，在干部和群众中形成了一个生动活泼的政治局面。这个生产队政治生活的显著特点是：干部听党的话，按政策办事；社员听干部的话，按指挥行动；干部群众一条心一股劲，说干就干，一干到底。（附图片）
