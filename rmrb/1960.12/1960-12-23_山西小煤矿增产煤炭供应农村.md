Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, December 21st: Small local coal mines in Shanxi Province are actively increasing coal production to supply rural canteens and provide heating for farmers during the winter. The province has planned for over six hundred small mines without train access to specifically produce coal for civilian use. They have already produced over two million tons of coal, which has been supplied to rural areas.

Since the beginning of winter, local coal mines in Shanxi, adhering to the principle of prioritizing external needs, have comprehensively planned production. Areas with convenient transportation are concentrating manpower and equipment to ensure production and support the entire country. For small mines with inconvenient transportation where coal cannot be shipped out, the county or people's commune organizes the mining to meet local needs. Across the province, 175 small coal mines have been renovated to meet the coal needs of rural canteens and the masses for the winter, with 25 of them being transformed into "small modern groups." These mines that have been transformed into "small modern groups" have greatly increased their output and have freed up more than 2,500 laborers. More than ten coal-deficient and coal-free counties in the province have also had nearby mines allocated to them by the Provincial Coal Management Bureau for exploitation, resolving the issue of coal for the masses.

Party committees at all levels in Shanxi paid early attention to the issue of rural fuel and heating for commune members during the winter at the end of the autumn harvest. In November, the Jin Southeast region convened a "Rural Domestic Coal Use" conference attended by thirteen coal mines and fuel stations and commercial bureaus of various counties, arranging a production plan of 246,600 tons of coal and signing coal supply contracts. Local coal management bureaus have also established domestic coal use dispatching agencies to specifically dispatch coal for rural domestic use during the winter. Lingchuan County transferred twenty-five technicians to various commune management areas to specifically assist in surveying and planning, and seventeen management areas have now begun to produce coal themselves.

    山西小煤矿增产煤炭供应农村
    据新华社太原21日电　山西省各地方小型煤矿积极增产煤炭，供给农村食堂和农民取暖过冬。全省规划出六百多个不通火车的小矿，专门生产民用煤，现已生产出二百多万吨煤，供应了农村。
    入冬以来，山西各地方煤矿本着先外后内的原则，对生产进行了全面规划，凡是交通方便的地方，都集中人力、设备保证生产，支援全国；对交通不便，煤炭运不出来的小矿，就由县或人民公社组织力量开采，供本地需要。全省各地为满足农村食堂和群众过冬用煤，已改造小煤矿一百七十五座，其中二十五座已改造成为“小洋群”。这些改造成为“小洋群”的煤矿，产量大大增加，并节约出了二千五百多个劳动力。全省十多个缺煤无煤县，也由省煤管局将附近矿井拨给他们开采，解决了群众用煤问题。
    山西各级党委在秋收结束时，就及早注意了农村燃料和社员过冬取暖的问题。晋东南地区在11月份召开了有十三个煤矿和各县燃料站、商业局等单位参加的“农村生活用煤”会议，安排了二十四万六千吨煤炭的生产计划，签订了供煤合同。各地煤管局并建立了生活用煤调度机构，专门调度冬季农村生活用煤。陵川县抽调二十五名技术工人，到各公社管理区具体帮助勘察规划，现在已有十七个管理区自己开始生产煤炭。
