Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai. The Shanghai New Shanghai Steel Plant is increasing production through conservation, using the same amount of steel ingots and billets to roll more and better steel for the country. Up to the end of November this year, the plant's steel output increased by 15.7% compared with the same period last year, the qualification rate and first-class rate reached 99.80% and 98.75% respectively, and 25 new products were added. Moreover, the yield of steel ingots and billets is also higher than last year. The implementation of the advanced experience of negative tolerance rolling alone resulted in an additional 8,971 tons of steel.

This factory has always attached importance to the increase in production and conservation of steel. The section steel produced by the whole factory generally adheres to negative tolerance rolling. Although the use of negative tolerance rolling places very strict requirements on steel rolling operations, they still adhere to this system in order to save steel ingots. For example, at the end of September, the quality of coal in the first branch factory was poor, the temperature of steel billets fluctuated greatly, and the variety of steel billets and steel produced was also relatively complicated. Therefore, a few employees were worried that the use of negative tolerance rolling would affect output and quality, and felt that it was safer to be "rather large than small." The branch factory's Party branch explained the benefits of negative tolerance to all employees, making the workers fully aware of the great significance of using it to produce more steel to support national construction, and did everything possible to roll each steel into a negative tolerance steel. In October, the branch not only increased steel production by 128 tons through negative tolerance rolling, exceeding the output plan by 5%, but also achieved a qualification rate of 99.99% and a first-class rate of 99.65%.

The factory also educated its employees to embody the idea of diligence and frugality in running the enterprise by improving the yield of steel billets. When rolling, workers of all types of work also echo each other and link up to improve the yield. They also summed up a set of operating experience of "making different rice from different meters" according to the performance of various steel types, and rolled each steel billet into a negative tolerance steel.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan. Employees of the Third Steelmaking Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company strictly adhere to the planned steel grades for steel tapping, creating favorable conditions for various steel rolling plants to increase steel production.

The Party committee of the factory attaches great importance to steel tapping according to the planned steel grades, and frequently publicizes to the workers and masses through various meetings the important significance of completing the steel grade plan for increasing steel production and supporting the whole country. The factory's leading cadres not only personally arrange the steel grade plan, but also specifically help each open hearth furnace to implement it. When organizing competitions between shifts and furnaces of the same type of work, they list the qualification rate of steel grades as one of the main evaluation criteria, and regularly publish the completion of the steel grade plan for each shift and each furnace, and introduce their experiences if they are well implemented. Zhang Jiuhua, the foreman of Class B, and Wang Youbang, the foreman of Class D, have always attached importance to the steel grade plan and conscientiously organized the workers of their respective classes to carry out the steel mixing and steel tapping performance competition. Since November, they have not produced a single can of unplanned steel. The factory immediately held a professional meeting to promote their advanced experience, using them as typical examples.

The factory also started with rectifying rules and regulations and made specific provisions on all aspects of operation related to eliminating unplanned steel. These measures have created conditions for steel tapping according to the planned steel grades. (Attached picture)

### 充分利用钢锭增产优质钢材  新沪钢厂坚持推行“负公差轧制”多产八千九百吨钢材  鞍钢三炼钢厂严格按计划钢种出钢为增产钢材创造条件

    充分利用钢锭增产优质钢材
    新沪钢厂坚持推行“负公差轧制”多产八千九百吨钢材
    鞍钢三炼钢厂严格按计划钢种出钢为增产钢材创造条件
    据新华社上海电　上海新沪钢铁厂以节约促进增产，用同样多的钢锭钢坯为国家轧制出更多更好的钢材。今年到11月底为止，这个厂的钢材产量比去年同期增长了15.7％，合格率和一级品率分别达到99.80％和98.75％以上，新产品增加了二十五种；而且，钢锭钢坯的成材率也比去年更高，其中只是由于推行负公差轧制的先进经验，就多轧出八千九百七十一吨的钢材。
    这个厂一直重视钢材的增产节约，全厂生产的型钢，一般都坚持采用了负公差轧制。虽然采用负公差轧制对轧钢操作要求很严格，但是，他们为了节省钢锭，仍然坚持执行了这一制度。如9月底，第一分厂因为煤的质量较差，钢坯温度波动大，钢坯品种和生产的钢材品种也比较复杂，因此有少数职工对采用负公差轧制有怕轧不好反而影响产量、质量的想法，觉得还是“宁大毋小”比较保险。分厂的党支部便向全体职工大讲负公差的好处，使工人们充分认识到用它来增产更多的钢材支援国家建设的重大意义，千方百计地使根根钢材都轧成负公差。10月份，这个分厂不仅用负公差轧制增产了一百二十八吨钢材，超额5％完成产量计划；而且合格率达到99.99％，一级品率达到99.65％。
    这个厂还教育职工，把勤俭办企业的思想，体现在提高钢坯成材率上。职工们在轧制的时候，各个工种的工人，也都前呼后应，环环扣紧，来提高成材率，并且根据各种钢种的性能，摸索出一套“什么米做什么饭”的操作经验，把每一种钢坯都轧成一根根负公差钢材。
    据新华社鞍山电　鞍山钢铁公司第三炼钢厂职工严格按计划钢种出钢，为各轧钢厂增产钢材创造了有利条件。
    这个厂的党委十分重视按计划钢种出钢，经常通过各种会议反复向职工群众宣传完成钢种计划对增产钢材、支援全国的重要意义。厂的领导干部不仅亲自动手安排钢种计划，而且具体帮助各座平炉贯彻执行。在组织班与班、炉与炉间同工种竞赛时，他们把钢种合格率列为主要评比条件之一，定期公布各班、各炉钢种计划完成情况，执行得好的就插红旗，介绍他们的经验。乙班工长张久华、丁班工长王有邦等，一贯重视钢种计划，认真组织本班职工开展配料出钢表演赛，11月份以来没有出过一罐非计划钢。厂里以他们为典型，立即召开了专业会议来推广他们的先进经验。
    这个厂还从整顿规章制度着手，对有关消灭非计划钢的各方面操作作出了具体规定。这些措施为按计划钢种出钢创造了条件。（附图片）
