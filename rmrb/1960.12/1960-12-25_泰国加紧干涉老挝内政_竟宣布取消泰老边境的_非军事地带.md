Xinhua News Agency, December 24th, Bangkok dispatch: In order to facilitate the direct dispatch of troops to interfere in Laos' internal affairs, the Thai reactionary authorities recently announced the cancellation of the "demilitarized zone" on the Thai-Lao border.

According to a report in the 《Honor Newspaper》 on the 22nd, Thailand and Laos had previously reached an agreement stipulating that no troops would be stationed within twenty-five kilometers of both banks of the Mekong River.

At the same time, the Thai Ministry of the Interior also issued a statement on the 21st, announcing the lifting of the trade embargo on the Thai-Lao border with immediate effect, so that the Thai government could more unscrupulously aid the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique entrenched in Vientiane. After the coup in Laos in August, the Sarit Thanarat government, under the pretext of maintaining border "security," imposed an economic blockade on the legitimate government of Phouma.

    泰国加紧干涉老挝内政
    竟宣布取消泰老边境的“非军事地带”
    新华社24日讯　曼谷消息：为了便于直接派遣军队干涉老挝内政，泰国反动当局最近竟宣布取消泰国和老挝边境的“非军事地带”。
    据《荣誉报》22日报道，过去泰国和老挝曾经达成一项协议，规定在湄公河两岸的二十五公里以内不准驻扎军队。
    与此同时，泰国内政部还在21日发表声明，宣布从即日起解除泰老边境的贸易禁令，以便泰国政府更加肆无忌惮地援助窃据万象的富米—文翁卖国集团。在8月间老挝发生政变以后，乃沙立政府曾经借口维持边境的“安全”，对老挝富马合法政府实行经济封锁。
