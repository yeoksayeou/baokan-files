Reforming the Farming System to Increase Grain Production
An Investigation into the Changes in the Farming System of the Shuiji Brigade
By Our Reporter

The Shuiji Brigade of the Shuiji Commune in Jianyang County, Fujian Province, has actively changed its farming system and increased its multiple cropping index in recent years, resulting in a significant increase in total grain production. This year, the brigade's multiple cropping index has increased to 220%, and total grain production has increased by 4.7% compared to last year.

The following is our investigation into the changes in the farming system of the Shuiji Brigade.

(I)

The Shuiji Brigade is located in the semi-mountainous area of northern Fujian. The brigade has more than 5,000 mu of grain fields, of which 50% are flatland fields, 30% are semi-mountainous terraced fields, and 20% are mountainous terraced fields. Historically, except for a small portion of grain fields that implemented three crops a year, most of the fields were planted with single-season rice, yielding only one harvest per year. After 1954, great efforts were made to change the farming system, gradually expanding the three-crop-a-year rotation system of rice, beans, and wheat, and the two-crop-a-year double-cropping rice system. The brigade's multiple cropping index has increased year by year. According to the investigation, with the grain area in 1953 as the base of 100, the multiple cropping index was 103% during the primary cooperative in 1954; it had increased to 166% during the advanced cooperative in 1956; it further increased to 211% after the communization in 1958; and now the multiple cropping index has increased to 220%. After the continuous increase of the multiple cropping index, the total grain production increased from more than 1,880,000 jin in 1954 to more than 3,400,000 jin this year, an increase of 80.4%. From 1955 to 1960, the annual average growth rate was 13.4%. The growth rate was the highest in 1957 and 1958, with an increase of 20% in 1957 and 15.4% in 1958. In the past two years, due to the impact of natural disasters, the increase has been smaller, with an increase of 5.8% in 1959 and 4.7% this year. Due to the continuous increase in grain production, this historically grain-deficient brigade has become a surplus grain brigade. Since 1957, it has not only not required the unified sale of hundreds of thousands of jin of grain but also has surplus grain to sell to the state.

(II)

From the current farming system of this production team, there are mainly three types: one is the single-crop-a-year system (single-season late rice); one is the two-crop-a-year system (double-cropping continuous cropping, intercropping rice); and one is the three-crop-a-year system (rice-bean-wheat rotation). Looking at the more than 5,000 mu of grain fields planted this year, single-crop-a-year accounts for 16.3% of the total cultivated area; two-crop-a-year accounts for 47.7%; and three-crop-a-year accounts for 36%. Comparing the absolute number of labor days spent on these three different farming systems this year: the three-crop-a-year system requires an average of 34 labor days per mu; the two-crop-a-year system requires an average of 25 labor days per mu; and the single-crop-a-year system requires an average of 13.5 labor days per mu. Comparing the absolute number of actual costs: the three-crop-a-year system costs an average of 15.5 yuan per mu; the two-crop-a-year system costs an average of 7.1 yuan per mu; and the single-crop-a-year system costs an average of 3.2 yuan per mu. Comparing the absolute number of grain yields actually harvested from these three different farming systems: the three-crop-a-year system yields an average of 865 jin per mu; the two-crop-a-year system yields an average of 542 jin per mu; and the single-crop-a-year system yields an average of 330 jin per mu. Comparing the output value of the three: the average output value of the three-crop-a-year system is 68.5 yuan per mu, the output value of the two-crop-a-year system is 32.5 yuan, and the output value of the single-crop-a-year system is 19.5 yuan.

The above investigations show that the two-crop-a-year and three-crop-a-year systems require more labor, more investment, and produce more. In this way, by spending the labor and cost equivalent to one season, the grain yield and output value can be increased by nearly one time on the same cultivated land, which is actually equivalent to increasing the utilization rate of the original land by one to two times. After the Shuiji Production Brigade implemented the two-crop-a-year and three-crop-a-year farming systems, although it required more labor and more investment, it effectively utilized the potential of the existing land and achieved good results in developing grain production at a high speed.

(III)

From the experience of the Shuiji Production Brigade, to make the change of farming system a success, a series of key issues must be resolved:

First is the land issue: The Shuiji Brigade has relatively good natural conditions. Of the original more than 5,000 mu of grain fields, 50% are flatland fields, and 50% are sandy soil, clay soil, deep-bottom rotten mud fields, and shallow-bottom rotten mud fields. To implement the change from single-cropping to double-cropping in these fields, the soil must be improved well. According to the investigation, in the Guo Kenglong area of the third team, a piece of 28 mu of shallow-bottom rotten mud mountain terraced fields, the change from one crop to two crops failed in 1957 and 1958. In 1959, the cadres and commune members decided to conduct soil improvement experiments on this piece of mountain terraced field, adopting measures such as digging ditches for drainage, applying heat-generating fertilizers, and increasing sunshine. As a result, both crops achieved a bumper harvest, with a yield of 485 jin per mu, which was 135 jin more than in 1958 and doubled the yield of a neighboring piece of 32 mu of unreformed shallow-bottom rotten mud field. This year, after the experience of the third team in transforming rotten mud fields was widely promoted, 420 mu of shallow-bottom rotten mud fields in the whole brigade were changed from single-cropping to double-cropping, and a bumper harvest was generally achieved. This shows that as long as the soil conditions are improved in accordance with local conditions, it is possible to increase the yield per unit area of some shallow-bottom rotten mud fields.

Second, regarding the seasonal issue: The Shuiji Brigade is located in a semi-mountainous area, with a long frost season in winter and frequent cold waves. After changing from single-cropping to double-cropping, if the transplanting of the first crop cannot be completed before "Qingming," it will inevitably affect the yield of the subsequent crop. How to sow early in a timely manner to extend the growing period of the first crop without affecting the transplanting of continuous rice crops has become a key issue in whether the reform of the farming system can increase production. In order to solve this contradiction and strive for bumper harvests for both crops, the cadres and commune members have been constantly exploring natural laws. In 1959, different seasonal transplanting experiments were adopted: eight mu transplanted before "Qingming" used the "Lu Cai Hao" variety for the first season and the "Wu Li" variety for the second season. As a result, the first season averaged 300 jin per mu, and the second season of continuous late rice harvested 350 jin; 400 mu transplanted during "Lixia" had the same soil quality and varieties. As a result, the first season averaged 230 jin per mu, and the second season yielded 250 jin per mu. Experiments have proved that appropriately advancing the season for sowing and transplanting is an effective way to solve the contradiction between timely harvesting of the early season and early transplanting of the late season. In order to solve the problem that early transplanting is prone to low temperatures and rotten seedlings, the commune members have created various methods such as seedling raising in the plains, transplanting in mountainous areas, and dry seedling nurseries. After the brigade widely promoted the experience of timely early transplanting in accordance with local conditions, the seasonal contradictions were well resolved.

Third is the labor issue: After the reform of the farming system, due to the expansion of the planting area, timely early sowing and transplanting, and improved cultivation quality, the labor contradiction, especially the seasonal labor contradiction, has become more prominent. According to the investigation, the team needs more than 78,000 labor days throughout the year, of which more than 24,000 labor days are required for spring harvest and spring planting, accounting for 30.5% of the total labor days; more than 28,000 labor days are required for summer harvest and summer planting, accounting for 38%; and more than 25,000 labor days are required for autumn harvest and autumn planting, accounting for 31.5%. The labor is most tense during the summer harvest and summer planting stage. How to ensure that both harvesting and planting are not delayed is extremely important. To solve this contradiction, in addition to ensuring a high degree of concentration of labor, effectively strengthening the scientific arrangement of labor, and promoting new agricultural tools to continuously improve work efficiency, a very important experience is to implement the matching of crop varieties. After the team selected different varieties such as "Nante Hao," "Lu Cai Hao," "Dazhai Early," "Xiaozhai Early," "Wanli Xian," and "Guangchang No. 13" for early rice, and "Wu Li," "Qing Ganzi," and "Nuogu" for late rice, they achieved a reasonable combination of early, medium, and late-maturing varieties, ensuring that harvesting was done in order, early and late, effectively overcoming the uneven phenomenon of harvesting being crowded together.

(IV)

The Shuiji Production Brigade has achieved remarkable results in changing the farming system and has accumulated some experience. However, since this is a major revolution in the farming system, the masses are not fully accustomed to it. In addition, some cadres and the masses did not consult enough and did not specifically analyze the conditions, so some land with poor natural conditions that should not have been changed was also changed. As a result, the yields of two seasons were not as good as one season. According to the investigation, among the 2,400 mu of land changed from single-cropping to double-cropping in the entire brigade, the average yield per mu after the change in 223 mu was 200 jin, which was 100 jin lower than the original single-cropping yield. At present, on the basis of summing up experiences and lessons, they are striving to do this work better next year. (Attached table)

    改革耕作制度，更多增产粮食
    水吉大队改变耕作制度情况的调查
    本报记者
    福建建阳县水吉公社水吉大队，几年来，积极改变耕作制度，提高复种指数，使粮食总产量显著增加。今年全队复种指数已提高到220％，粮食总产量比去年增加4.7％。
    下面是我们对水吉大队改革耕作制度情况的调查。
    （一）
    水吉大队地处闽北半山区。全队有粮田面积五千多亩，其中平洋田占50％，半山垅田占30％，山垅田占20％，历来除小部分粮田实行一年三熟外，其它绝大部分田地都是种植一年一熟的单季稻。1954年后，大力改变耕作制度，逐步扩大稻、豆、麦一年三熟的轮作制和一年二熟的双季稻，全队复种指数逐年提高。据调查，以1953年粮食面积基数为一百，1954年初级社时，复种指数为103％；1956年高级社时复种指数已提高到166％；1958年公社化后又提高到211％；现在复种指数提高到220％。复种指数不断提高后，粮食总产量由1954年的一百八十八万多斤增加到今年的三百四十多万斤，增长80.4％。从1955年到1960年，六年来每年平均增长13.4％；以1957、1958年增长幅度最大，1957年增长20％，1958年增长15.4％；近两年因受自然灾害的影响，增产幅度较小，1959年增长5.8％，今年增长4.7％。由于粮食连年增加，这个一贯缺粮队已变为余粮队，从1957年开始不但不要统销几十万斤粮食，还有余粮卖给国家。
    （二）
    从这个生产队目前耕作制度来看，主要有三种：一是一年一熟制（单季晚稻）；一是一年二熟制（双季连作、间作稻）；一是一年三熟制（稻一豆一麦轮作）。从今年所种植的五千多亩粮田来看，其中一年一熟的占总耕地面积的16.3％；一年二熟的占47.7％；一年三熟的占36％。这三种不同耕作制度今年实际花工绝对数比较：一年三熟制的每亩平均花工三十四个；一年二熟制的每亩平均花工二十五个；一年一熟制的每亩平均花工十三个半。从实际所付出的成本绝对数作比较：一年三熟制，每亩平均成本十五元五角；一年二熟制，每亩平均成本七元一角；一年一熟制，每亩平均成本三元二角。从这三种不同耕作制度实际收获的粮食产量绝对数作比较：一年三熟制每亩平均产量为八百六十五斤；一年二熟制平均亩产为五百四十二斤；一年一熟制平均亩产为三百三十斤。再从三者产值作比较：一年三熟的平均每亩产值为六十八元五角，一年二熟的产值为三十二元五角，一年一熟的产值为十九元五角。
    以上各项调查表明，花工大、投资多、增产多的要算一年二熟和一年三熟，这样只要花相当于一季的劳力和成本，就可以在同样的耕地上增加近一倍的粮食产量与产值，实际上等于把原有的土地利用率提高一倍到二倍。水吉生产大队推行一年二熟和一年三熟的耕作制度后，花工虽多，投资虽大，却有效地发挥了现有土地潜力，收到了高速度发展粮食生产的良好效果。
    （三）
    从水吉生产大队的经验看，要使改变耕作制度获得成功，必须解决一系列关键性问题：
    第一是土地问题：水吉大队自然条件一般较好，原有五千多亩粮田中有50％是平洋田，还有50％是砂质土、粘质土和深底烂泥田、浅底烂泥田。这些田要实行单季改双季，必须很好改良土壤。据调查，这个队第三小队郭坑垅一片二十八亩浅底烂泥山垅田，在1957、1958两年，一熟改二熟都遭到失败。1959年干部与社员决心在这片山垅田进行改良土壤的试验，采取开沟排水、施用热性肥料、增加日照等措施，结果二熟都得到丰收，亩产达四百八十五斤，比1958年多收了一百三十五斤，比邻近一片未改造的三十二亩浅底烂泥田增产一倍。今年，普遍推广第三小队改造烂泥田经验后，全队四百二十亩浅底烂泥田改一熟为二熟，普遍获得丰收。这说明只要因地制宜地改良土壤条件，部分浅底烂泥田提高单位面积产量是可能的。
    第二，关于季节问题：水吉大队地处半山区，冬季霜期较长，经常遭受寒潮袭击。一熟改二熟后，如果第一熟不能在“清明”前完成插秧，就势必影响后作产量。如何适时早种，以延长第一熟生长期，又不影响连作稻插秧，就成为改革耕作制度能否增产的关键问题。为了解决这个矛盾，争取二熟同时丰收，干部和社员不断摸索自然规律。1959年采取不同季节插秧试验：一是“清明”前插秧的八亩，第一季采用“陆财号”种，第二季采用“乌梨”种，结果第一季每亩平均收三百斤，第二季连作晚稻收三百五十斤；一是在“立夏”插秧的四百亩，土质品种相同，结果第一季每亩平均收二百三十斤，第二季亩产二百五十斤。通过试验证明，适当提早季节播种插秧，是解决早季适时收割和晚季提早插秧矛盾的有效办法。为了解决提早插秧容易遇上低温遭受烂秧，社员创造了平原育秧、山地插秧与旱秧寄秧等多种办法。全队因地制宜地推广适时早插经验后，季节矛盾得到很好解决。
    第三是劳力问题：改革耕作制度后，由于种植面积的扩大，适时早播早插以及提高耕作质量等，劳力矛盾特别是季节性的劳力矛盾更为突出。据调查，该队全年需要七万八千多个劳动日，其中投入春收春种的共需二万四千多个劳动日，占总劳动日的30.5％；夏收夏种共需二万八千多个劳动日，占38％；秋收秋种共需二万五千多个劳动日，占31.5％。其中以夏收夏种阶段劳力最紧张。如何保证收种两不误是极为重要的。解决这一矛盾，除保证劳动力高度集中，切实加强劳力科学安排，以及推广新式农具，以不断提高工效外，一条很重要的经验是实行作物品种的搭配。这个队早稻分别选用了“南特号”、“陆财号”、“大寨早”、“小寨早”、“万利籼”、“广场十三号”，晚稻选用了“乌梨”、“青秆子”、“糯谷”等不同品种后，做到早、中、晚熟品种合理搭配，保证了收割有先有后，有早有晚，有效地克服了收割挤在一块的忙闲不均现象。
    （四）
    水吉生产大队改变耕作制度，已经取得显著效果，并积累了一些经验。但由于这是耕作制度的大革命，群众尚未完全习惯，加上部分干部和群众商量不够，不具体分析条件，使一些土地等自然条件较差的不应当改的土地也改了，结果两季收成不顶一季。据调查，全大队一熟改二熟的二千四百亩土地中，有二百二十三亩改制后每亩平均产量二百斤，比原一熟产量低一百斤。目前，他们在总结经验教训的基础上，力争明年把这项工作搞得更好。（附图表）
