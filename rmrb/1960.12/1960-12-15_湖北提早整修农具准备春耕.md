Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 14th: In the past month, rural people's communes in Hubei Province have prepared a large number of handy farm tools for winter field management. They are now seizing the slack winter season to repair and manufacture various farm tools for the upcoming spring plowing and large-scale production next year.

As soon as the autumn harvest and autumn planting ended this year, activities to repair and replenish small farm tools began throughout the province.

Various localities first strengthened and improved the farm tool repair and distribution network, especially strengthening and leveraging the repair capabilities at the production team level. Many communes have transferred some iron, wood, bamboo, stone, and other handicraft workers to the production teams to strengthen the repair stations and groups at the production team level. Chongyang, Xianning, Wuchang, and Yingcheng counties have already established 1,094 repair stations and groups in production teams. Lishan Commune in Sui County not only has repair groups in every team but also organized more than a dozen small stalls and peddlers in the three market towns within the commune to repair and manufacture simple small farm tools in the market. These repair groups, small stalls, and peddlers have repaired and replenished more than 28,000 pieces of farm tools and implements needed for winter field management and small-scale water conservancy projects. They have also helped production teams build 270 farm tool storage rooms. At the same time, they have produced more than 11,000 pieces of daily necessities urgently needed by the masses, such as kitchen knives, pot shovels, fire tongs, wooden buckets, and baskets, which have been warmly welcomed by the masses.

During the activities to repair and replenish small farm tools, the provincial commercial departments successively allocated two batches of raw materials such as steel, iron, coal, and wood, specifically for the repair and manufacture of small farm tools. Local industrial, commercial, transportation, and material departments, as well as communes and production teams, have also actively adopted many methods such as production, procurement, inventory clearance, recycling scrap iron and steel, and trading old for new to solve the problem of raw materials. In Jingzhou Prefecture, a total of 745 tons of scrap iron were cleared and transferred during inventory clearance, which can be used to manufacture more than 600,000 small farm tools. Production teams actively organized labor to burn charcoal or organized short-distance transportation to transport coal and iron to supply the needs of farm tool repair.

    湖北提早整修农具准备春耕
    据新华社武汉14日电　湖北省各地农村人民公社一个多月来已经为今冬田间管理准备了大批应手的农具，目前正抓紧冬闲时间为明年春耕大生产修理和赶制各种农具。
    今年秋收秋种一结束，修理、补充小型农具的活动便在全省各地开展起来。
    各地首先加强和健全了农具修配网，特别是加强和发挥生产队一级的修配力量。许多公社都下放了一部分铁、木、篾、石等手工业工人到生产队，以充实生产队的修配站、修配组。崇阳、咸宁、武昌、应城四县，已在生产队建立起修配站和修配组一千零九十四个。随县历山公社不仅队队都有修配组，还在社内三个集镇上组织了十多个小摊、小挑子，在市场上修补、制造简易小农具。这些修配组和小摊、小挑，已经修理、补充冬季田间管理和小型水利所需要的农具和工具二万八千多件，还帮助小队修建农具保管室二百七十间，同时生产了群众急需的菜刀、锅铲、火钳、木桶、篓子等生活用品一万一千多件，受到群众的热烈欢迎。
    在修理、补充小型农具的活动中，省商业部门先后调拨两批钢、铁、煤、木等原材料，专门供应修理和制造小农具需用。各地工业、商业、交通、物资等部门，以及公社、生产队也都积极采取生产、采购、清仓、回收废钢铁、以旧换新等许多办法，来解决原材料问题。荆州地区在清仓中，共清理、调剂出杂铁七百四十五吨，可供制造小农具六十多万件。生产队积极组织劳动力烧炭或组织短途运输，运煤、运铁，供应农具修补的需要。
