    A Good Apprentice of the Commune Members

    That was the second day after Lao Liu arrived at Changliang Commune in Jianshi County. The commune held a meeting of cadres at the management district level and above. The people attending the meeting rushed from their villages, hurrying so much they were all covered in sweat. At this time, a middle-aged man was seen diligently pouring water for them to wash their faces and hands, and arranging their luggage and accommodations. Some cadres thought he was a new waiter. Just then, the commune Party secretary walked past him and said to this middle-aged man, "Commune Chief Liu, you've only just arrived at the commune and you're already acting like a host!"

    Everyone suddenly understood. He was Liu Quanxi, the deputy commune chief and Communist Party member who had been sent down from the province this time.

    Lao Liu was born into a poor peasant family. He joined the revolution at the age of fifteen and became a "little Eighth Route Army soldier." In 1950, he was transferred to work at the Hubei Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China. He had lived in a big city for ten years. After he was recently approved to be sent down to Changliang Commune, he first lived among the masses as an ordinary laborer. Wherever he went, he worked there. When noon came and the commune members rested, he didn't rest. Whenever he had time, he would push the mill, sweep the floor, thresh grain in the sun… He handled all kinds of tasks readily. During the harvest, he was stationed in the second team of Longli Production Brigade, and he harvested grain with the commune members every day. Back at the canteen, as soon as he put down his sickle, he would habitually go to the mill room to push the mill.

    Liu Quanxi was from out of town and not familiar with the local farm work, but the commune members saw that he picked up heavy and light work and did it deftly, so they were all willing to teach him and take him as their apprentice. Once, when Liu Quanxi first used a sickle to harvest grain, he held the blade upward. Before he had cut two bundles, the sickle cut his finger. An old woman of fifty or sixty years old walked up to him and naturally took his hand to teach him how to use the sickle until he learned. In this way, with the help of the commune members, Liu Quanxi successively learned various kinds of work such as harvesting grain, flailing, plowing… (Attached picture)

专栏：下放干部在农村

    社员的好徒弟
    那是老刘刚到建始县长梁公社第二天的事。公社召开管理区以上干部会议，参加会议的人，一个个从乡里赶来，跑得快，走得急，人人都是汗水直流。这时，只见一个中年人殷勤地给他们倒水洗脸、洗手，安顿他们的行李和住宿。当时有的干部以为他是新来的服务员，恰好公社党委书记从他旁边走过，对这位中年人说：刘社长你刚到公社就当起主人来啦！
    这一下大家恍然大悟。他就是这次省里下放的副社长、共产党员刘全喜。
    老刘出生在贫农家庭，十五岁那年参加革命工作，当“小八路”。1950年转业到中国人民银行湖北省分行工作，十年来一直在大城市生活。最近他被批准下放到长梁公社以后，首先就以一个普通劳动者的身份，生活在群众中间。他走到哪里，劳动到哪里，晌午回来，社员歇气，他不歇气，只要有空，推磨呀，打扫卫生呀，晒谷打场呀……。大小活儿顺手干，割谷时，他驻在陇里生产队二小队，天天和社员一起割谷。回到食堂，刚放下镰刀，就又习惯地到磨房里推磨。
    刘全喜是外地人，对本地的农事活路不熟悉，但是社员们看着他轻重活儿捡起来就干，而且干得很利索，就都愿意教他，收他为自己的徒弟。有一次，刘全喜第一次拿镰刀割谷，刀口朝上，没割二捆，手指被镰刀划破了皮，有个五六十岁的老婆婆走上前来，很自然地拿着他的手教他使镰刀，一直到学会为止。就这样，刘全喜在社员们的帮助下，先后学会了割谷、甩槤枷、扙犁……等各种各样的活路。（附图片）
