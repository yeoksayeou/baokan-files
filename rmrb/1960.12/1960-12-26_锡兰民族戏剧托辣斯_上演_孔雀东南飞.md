Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, 24th. The Ceylon government-run National Drama Trust tonight staged a Sinhala-language play here, adapted from the famous ancient Chinese poem "The Peacock Flies Southeast."

The script was written by the young Ceylonese playwright, Pereira. This script was first performed by the "Kalapela" amateur troupe in early July this year. After successful performances in many cities in Ceylon, it has now been selected as the play to be performed this week by the National Drama Trust. This trust was established at the beginning of this year to promote Sinhala-language drama. Any play performed by a professional or amateur troupe, once listed on the National Drama Trust's program, will be awarded.

Critics here believe that the writing and performance of this script is a successful attempt.

    锡兰民族戏剧托辣斯
    上演“孔雀东南飞”
    新华社科伦坡24日电　锡兰政府办的民族戏剧托辣斯今晚在这里上演了根据著名的中国古诗《孔雀东南飞》改编的僧伽罗语剧本。
    剧本是由年青的锡兰剧作家佩雷拉编写的。这个剧本曾在今年7月初由“卡拉佩拉”业余剧团初次公演。在锡兰许多城市作了成功的演出后，现在被选为民族戏剧托辣斯在本周上演的剧目。这个托辣斯是为了推广僧伽罗语戏剧而在今年年初成立的。任何职业或业余剧团演过的剧目，一旦被列在民族戏剧托辣斯的节目上，剧团就获奖。
    这里的评论家认为这个剧本的写作和演出是一次成功的尝试。
