Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, December 17th. Albanian newspapers "People's Voice" and "Unity" published commentaries on the 16th, celebrating the 13th anniversary of the signing of the Albanian-Bulgarian Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance, and Cooperation (December 16th).

    "People's Voice" published a commentary entitled "Brotherly Friendship Beneficial to Socialism and Peace," stating that the Albanian-Bulgarian Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance, and Cooperation is an inseparable part of the common friendship between our people and the Soviet people, and the people of all countries in the socialist camp, and it strengthens this friendship.

    The commentary said that the Albanian people understand and strongly protect the friendship and brotherly cooperation with the Bulgarian people, because this friendship and cooperation is fully in line with the interests of socialism and peace. The more united the people of the countries in the socialist camp, the more powerful the guarantee of the independence of each socialist country, and the more guaranteed world peace. Precisely because of this, the deadly enemies of peace and socialism—U.S. imperialism and its faithful agent, the Belgrade revisionists—direct their attacks primarily against the unity of the countries in the socialist camp. They have been trying by every possible means to weaken this unity in the past and present. However, their conspiracies and tricks have completely and shamefully failed. Albanian-Bulgarian friendship has developed and been consolidated. It has been and is unbreakable, and it is beneficial to the people of our two countries, and to peace and socialism.

    The commentary in "Unity" said, "Our two countries are members of the socialist camp and signatories to the Warsaw Pact. We are both resolutely fighting for peace and international security, and against the war plots of the imperialists, especially the U.S. imperialists."

    The commentary stated that our friendship will be continuously strengthened in the struggle for peace, for socialism, for further strengthening the unity of the socialist camp, and against the sabotage activities of imperialism and its agents, modern revisionism, especially the lackeys of U.S. imperialism, the Belgrade revisionists.

    阿尔巴尼亚报纸庆祝阿保友好条约签订十三周年
    社会主义阵营越团结世界和平越有保障
    美帝国主义和南修正主义者的挑拨阴谋遭到可耻失败
    新华社地拉那17日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》和《团结报》16日分别发表评论，庆祝阿尔巴尼亚和保加利亚友好互助合作条约签订十三周年（12月16日）。
    《人民之声报》以《有利于社会主义和和平的兄弟友谊》为题发表评论说，阿保友好互助合作条约是我国人民同苏联人民、同社会主义阵营所有国家人民的共同友谊的不可分割的一部分，它并且加强了这种友谊。
    评论说，阿尔巴尼亚人民体会到，并且有力地保护着同保加利亚人民的友谊和兄弟合作。因为这种友谊和合作是完全符合社会主义和和平的利益的。评论说，社会主义阵营各国人民愈团结，保障每个社会主义国家独立的保证就越有力，世界和平就越有保障。正因为如此，和平和社会主义的死敌——美帝国主义和它的忠实的代理人贝尔格莱德修正主义者的攻击锋芒首先是针对社会主义阵营各国的团结，他们过去和现在都在千方百计地削弱这种团结。但是，他们的阴谋诡计完全遭到了可耻的失败。阿保友谊发展了和巩固了。它过去和现在都是牢不可破的，它有利于我们两国人民，有利于和平和社会主义。
    《团结报》的评论说，“我们两国都是社会主义阵营的一员、华沙条约的缔约国，我们都坚决为争取和平和国际安全、反对帝国主义者特别是美帝国主义者的战争策划而斗争。”
    评论说，我们的友谊将在争取和平、争取社会主义、争取进一步加强社会主义阵营的团结、反对帝国主义和它的代理人现代修正主义，特别是美帝国主义的奴仆贝尔格莱德修正主义者的破坏活动的斗争中，得到不断的加强。
