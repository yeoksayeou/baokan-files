    Adhering to the Policy of Combining Education with Productive Labor
    Xinjiang Petroleum Institute Students Achieve All-Around Development
    (Our report) Xinjiang Petroleum Institute has established various labor bases, steadfastly implementing the policy of combining education with productive labor, enabling young students of all ethnic groups to achieve all-around development.
    Xinjiang Petroleum Institute, established in 1958, is a school for training high- and middle-level technical personnel for the petroleum industry. Currently, it has three departments—drilling, oil production, and oilfield machinery—and eight secondary-level specialties: geology, drilling, oil production, refining, internal combustion engines, oilfield machinery, refinery machinery, and oilfield construction. There are over 1,300 students of various ethnic groups, including Han, Uygur, Kazakh, Hui, and Xibe. Since its establishment, the institute has been comprehensively implementing the policy of combining education with productive labor. In the process of establishing labor bases, they have made the best of available resources and established an on-campus practical training factory. Starting with just one lathe, with teachers acting as technicians and students as apprentices, they have developed it in more than two years into a factory with four workshops, eight types of work, and more than twenty machine tools. This serves as a labor base for students to participate in short-term professional labor and master basic skills. Except for first-year students of various departments and specialties taking general courses, all students in the school, according to the teaching plan, regularly work as factory workers for at least one month each year. In their labor, they consolidate and improve their professional courses and master the basic operating techniques of general machining, fitting, and casting. They have established drilling teams, oil production teams, and geological teams in production enterprises such as the Karamay Oilfield, with students serving as both workers and cadres, as fixed labor bases for a relatively long period of one year. Students of various departments and specialties participate in production labor in these teams in the year before graduation. During this year, students are both workers genuinely undertaking production tasks and also work in four shifts to ensure at least two hours of theoretical study time each day. On the one hand, teachers or invited experts and veteran workers provide on-site teaching, explaining theoretical courses and new technologies and knowledge in production that were not easily understood in the classroom in the past. On the other hand, students propose topics for graduation design based on production practice and conduct on-site design defenses, closely integrating theoretical knowledge with production and serving production.
    Among the 250 students who have graduated in the past two years, more than 82.4% have achieved good or excellent grades. Most students who graduate from secondary-level specialties can assume the duties of technicians or equivalent positions in production units without undergoing internships. Before graduation, students generally reach the actual operating level of third- to fifth-grade skilled workers. They have also achieved great success in theoretical knowledge. Geology majors who graduated in 1959 collectively compiled lecture notes such as "Geotectonics of Xinjiang" and "Oil and Gas Areas of Xinjiang," totaling hundreds of thousands of words.

    坚持教育与生产劳动相结合的方针
    新疆石油学院学生全面发展
    本报讯　新疆石油学院建立各种劳动基地，坚持贯彻执行教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，使各族青年学生获得全面发展。
    新疆石油学院是1958年成立的一所培养高、中等石油工业技术人才的学校，目前共设有钻井、采油、矿场机械等三个系和地质、钻井、采油、炼油、内燃机、矿场机械、炼厂机械、油田建设等八个中等专业，在校学习的有汉、维吾尔、哈萨克、回、锡伯等各民族学生一千三百多人。这个学院从成立以来，在全面贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，建立劳动基地的过程中，因陋就简，举办了校内的实习工厂，他们依靠一部车床起家，由教师当技工、学生当学徒，在两年多时间里发展成为一座有四个车间、八个工种、二十多部机床的工厂，作为学生参加短期的专业劳动和掌握基本技术的劳动基地，除了普通课各系、专业的一年级学生以外，全校的学生都按照教学计划做到每年至少定期在工厂当工人一个月，在劳动中巩固和提高专业课程，并且掌握一般的机工、钳工和铸工的基本操作技术。他们在克拉玛依油区等生产企业中，建立由学生担任全套工人和干部的钻井队、采油队、地质队等，作为固定一年的比较长时间的劳动基地，各系、专业学生在毕业前一年到这些队里参加生产劳动。在这一年中，学生既是真刀真枪担负生产任务的工人，同时，又实行四班作业，保证每天有二小时以上的理论知识学习时间，一方面由教师或邀请专家、老工人进行现场教学，讲授过去在课堂上不容易懂的理论课和生产中的新技术、新知识；一方面由学生根据生产实践提出题目进行毕业设计，并且进行现场设计答辩，使理论知识密切结合生产并且为生产服务。
    两年来毕业的二百五十名学生中，成绩优良的占到82.4％以上，中等专业毕业的学生绝大部分不经过实习就可以担任生产单位的技术员或相当的职务。学生在毕业前普遍都达到三至五级技术工人的实际操作水平。在理论知识方面也获得很大成就，地质专业1959年毕业学生集体编写出“新疆大地构造”、“新疆油气区”等几十万字的讲义。
