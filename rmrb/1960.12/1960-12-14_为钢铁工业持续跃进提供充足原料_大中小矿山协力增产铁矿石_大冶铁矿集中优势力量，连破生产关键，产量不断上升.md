Xinhua News Agency, December 13th: Hardworking staff and workers in iron ore mines across the country, following the principle of prioritizing the development of the mining industry this year, are striving to increase the production of iron ore, creating material conditions for realizing the sustained leap forward of the steel industry. According to statistics, the ore output of more than a dozen key iron mines in the first ten months increased by about one-third compared with the same period last year; the ore output of medium and small iron mines in Hunan, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Sichuan, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Shaanxi provinces has increased compared with the same period last year.

In order to increase the production of iron ore, large mines have implemented an important innovation in production technology this year, namely, centralized mining and tunneling operations; some large open-pit mines have also launched a "10,000-ton, 1,000-meter" production competition campaign (that is, a three-cubic-meter electric shovel loads 10,000 tons of ore per day, and a drilling machine drills 1,000 meters of rock per month).

The so-called centralized mining and tunneling operation means concentrating equipment and manpower on the better mining and tunneling working faces, which simultaneously achieves the effects of increasing output, accelerating tunneling, improving efficiency, and reducing costs. The Daye Iron Mine began to promote centralized operations in late September, transferring a large part of the mine's manpower and more than half of its electric shovels, drilling machines, and heavy-duty trucks to two working faces with abundant ore reserves; Chen Mingjiang, the secretary of the iron mine's Party committee, and Meng Guangsen, the secretary of the general Party branch of the mining workshop, also led a group of cadres to "set up camp" on these two working faces to direct production. As a result, the average daily ore output increased by more than 26% compared with before the implementation of centralized operations, and the tunneling speed was also greatly accelerated. Dalianzi Iron Mine, one of Anshan Iron and Steel's mines, has concentrated the equipment and manpower scattered in 27 mining areas to 22 mining areas since May of this year. Both the ore output and the tunneling speed have increased by more than 30% compared with before the implementation of centralized operations. It has also promoted the maintenance and upkeep of mining equipment, the exchange of production experience among workers, and the strengthening of production management.

The "10,000-ton, 1,000-meter" competition campaign in open-pit mines, which started in large open-pit iron mines in March this year, has seen more than 40 electric drilling machines reaching 1,000 meters of drilling per month in the Dagushan Iron Mine of Anshan Iron and Steel, the Daye Iron Mine of Wuhan Iron and Steel, and the Bayan Obo Iron Mine of Baotou Steel alone. In the past year, only one drilling machine in the country had created such an outstanding production record. After the Dagushan Iron Mine launched the "10,000-ton, 1,000-meter" production competition campaign, the drivers of electric shovels, drilling machines, and electric locomotives cooperated more closely, creating a new situation in mining production, and the ore output continued to increase. In order to promote this competition, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry organized an observation team composed of advanced producers to tour large and medium-sized open-pit iron mines, spreading the operating experience of "10,000-ton electric shovels" and "1,000-meter drilling machines."

Medium and small iron mines, which account for more than half of the country's iron ore output, have played a significant role in production this year after technical transformations. These medium and small iron mines were mostly established during the mass movement of the Great Leap Forward in Steel Production in 1958. In the past two years, due to the continuous increase in the demand for iron ore, and the gradual development of mining working faces into the deep parts of the mines, there is an urgent need to carry out technical transformations on these mines to improve ore output, quality, and mining efficiency. To this end, these mines have carried out technical transformation work this year, mainly including the construction of railways to improve the external and internal transportation capacity of the mines; the erection of circuits to provide power for improving mine production; and the implementation of mechanization and semi-mechanization of mining and tunneling. At present, more than 110 mines across the country have built small railways, more than 60 mines have erected circuits, and more than 80 mines have built small power stations. These mines have basically eliminated the heavy labor of carrying on shoulders and backs, and some mines have eliminated the operation of manual rock drilling. After the transformation, the mining efficiency has greatly improved. Hunan Province, which has completed its iron ore production plan ahead of schedule this year, has created more than 1,000 indigenous rock drilling machines, more than 30 indigenous electric drills, and a batch of indigenous winches and indigenous cableways in the process of carrying out technical transformations on medium and small mines, greatly improving the mechanization and semi-mechanization level of these mines. More than a dozen mines in the province have basically eliminated manual rock drilling and shoulder transportation, and the daily ore output level in October was more than double that at the beginning of the year. In the first batch of iron mines in Shandong Province to undergo technical transformation, most of the external transportation has been changed to small railways, and the internal transportation has also been exempted from manual carrying.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 13th: The Party committee of the Daye Iron Mine of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company has summarized a working method of attacking key problems, consolidating gains, and preparing for the next stage. Since late September, the entire mine has seen a situation in which production bottlenecks are being broken one after another, and production is rising again and again. Compared with September, the average daily output of ore in the entire mine increased by 57.3% in October, and by another 13.25% in November. The amount of recoverable ore prepared by the entire mine has also increased by more than three times compared with September. Therefore, it has not only ensured the current production needs of Wuhan Iron and Steel, but also prepared sufficient ore for the first quarter of next year.

Under the guidance of the idea of "concentrating superior forces to annihilate the enemy one by one" and taking one step and looking to the next, the Party committee of the Daye Iron Mine mobilized the masses to conscientiously summarize the experience of organizing "key problem attack battles" in its own mine and in other places, and formulated a long-term and comprehensive plan for carrying out "key problem attack battles," arranging the key problems in production in batches and phases, concentrating superior forces to break through them one by one, and closely combining key problem attacks, consolidation, and preparation. Since late September of this year, they have adopted this working method to carry out three consecutive "key problem attack battles," all of which have achieved significant results.

The mine's production was not normal in the second and third quarters of this year. After careful analysis and research, the main reason was the insufficient amount of recoverable ore. Therefore, they decided to first break through the 96-meter level of Shizishan and the 128-meter level of Jianshan, which have abundant ore reserves, as two major key points. The entire mine concentrated its leadership, equipment, accessories, technology, and political work on attacking the key problems. The secretary of the mine's Party committee and the mine's director went to the mountain to participate in labor and direct production at the two levels. 70% of the mine's and workshops' section-level cadres and engineering and technical personnel moved their luggage to the mountain and implemented rotational shifts. More than half of the mine's electric shovels, drilling machines, automobiles, and other equipment were also driven to these two levels for centralized operation. The staff of all auxiliary trades provided services for the main attack on the key problems. Political propagandists also concentrated on the scene, talked about the situation, and carried out propaganda and mobilization work. After doing so, within a week, the trench of the 96-meter level of Shizishan was breached, and a large amount of ore began to be produced. Then, the trench of the 128-meter level of Jianshan, which had not been opened for more than four months, was also opened. The amount of recoverable ore reserved by the entire mine increased sharply from more than a month to five months.

In order to consolidate the results, the Daye Iron Mine strengthened management while organizing key problem attacks. Combining rest and reorganization, it inspected and summarized the specific experiences and methods of breaking through production bottlenecks, "matched" the experiences "into a complete set," set them as systems, and incorporated them into the enterprise management regulations. For example, in the past, when using drilling machines to drill holes, many people believed that the depth should not exceed 16 meters, and some only drilled 12 meters before blasting, so that the roots and the whole large stone could not be blasted open, which seriously affected the speed of mining ore. This time, the mining workshop adopted the method of "three combinations" and conducted multiple drilling depth tests on the spot. The results proved that it was possible to drill 25 meters, the blasting quality was good, and the roots of large pieces were eliminated. Therefore, these new experiences were immediately incorporated into the operating procedures with the approval of the leaders, and are now widely promoted. They also universally improved the leadership core of the class, group, and single machine, established a democratic management system, and implemented a collaborative system with the electric shovel as the center, including seven trades such as drilling machine, automobile, rock drilling, blasting, bulldozer, and air compressor. In this way, they not only enriched management experience, but also consolidated the achievements of key problem attacks. After the 96-meter level trench of Shizishan was breached, the daily ore output of this level has remained stable at 4,500 to 5,000 tons.

While concentrating forces to attack key problems and strengthening management to consolidate the achievements of key problem attacks, the mine was also quick to prepare for the next stage of key problem attacks. For example, in the process of breaking through the 96-meter level trench of Shizishan, it was discovered in a timely manner that the 112-meter level was the key to affecting the advancement of the 96-meter level. Therefore, on the one hand, it focused on the main attack on the 96-meter level trench to achieve a complete victory, and on the other hand, it prepared for the next step of breaking through the 112-meter level trench from all aspects, such as manpower, equipment, raw material supply, and spare parts. As a result, although this trench was as high as 16 meters and very difficult, because it was prepared early and prepared fully, it was opened two days ahead of schedule. After the 112-meter level was opened, the new key point in the west exit of Shizishan was attacked. In this way, the victory of "key problem attack battles" was achieved one after another.

    为钢铁工业持续跃进提供充足原料
    大中小矿山协力增产铁矿石
    大冶铁矿集中优势力量，连破生产关键，产量不断上升
    新华社13日讯　辛勤劳动在全国各地铁矿山上的广大职工，今年根据优先发展采掘工业的方针，努力增产铁矿石，为实现钢铁工业的持续跃进创造了物质条件。据统计，十几座重点铁矿山头十个月的矿石产量，比去年同期增加了三分之一左右；湖南、河北、河南、山东、四川、福建、江西、陕西等省的中、小型铁矿山的矿石产量都比去年同期增加。
    为了增产铁矿石，大型矿山今年在生产技术上实行了一项重要革新，即采矿、掘进集中作业；一些大型露天矿山还开展了“万吨、千米”（即三立方米电铲每日装矿一万吨，穿孔机每月凿岩一千米）的生产竞赛运动。
    所谓采矿、掘进集中作业，就是把设备、人力，集中使用在条件较好的采掘工作面上，同时收到提高产量、加速掘进、提高效率、降低成本之效。大冶铁矿从9月下旬开始推行集中作业，把全矿很大一部分人力和一半以上的电铲、穿孔机、载重汽车等，调集到两个矿石储量很丰富的掌子面上；铁矿的党委书记陈明江和采矿车间党总支书记孟广森等，也分别带领一批干部在这两个掌子面上“安营扎寨”，指挥生产。结果，矿石平均日产量，比实行集中作业以前增长了26％以上，掘进速度也大大加快了。鞍钢的矿山之一——大栗子铁矿从今年5月起，把分散在二十七个采矿区的设备和人力，集中使用到二十二个采矿区，矿石产量和掘进速度都比实行集中作业以前提高了30％以上，而且对于维修和保养采掘设备，在工人中交流生产经验和加强生产管理工作等方面，也起了推动作用。
    露天矿山的“万吨、千米”竞赛运动，从今年3月在大型露天铁矿开展后，仅鞍钢的大孤山铁矿、武钢的大冶铁矿和包钢的白云鄂博铁矿，每月凿岩达到一千米以上的穿孔机，已经出现了四十多台次。而在去年，全国只有一台穿孔机创造过这样优异的生产纪录。大孤山铁矿开展“万吨、千米”生产竞赛运动后，电铲、穿孔机和电机车的司机们，相互配合得更加紧密，采矿生产开创了一个崭新的局面，矿石产量不断增加。冶金工业部为了推动这个竞赛运动，曾经组织一个由先进生产者参加的观摩队，在大中型露天铁矿山巡回观摩表演，传播“万吨电铲”、“千米穿孔机”的操作经验。
    占全国铁矿石产量一半以上的中小型铁矿山，今年进行技术改造后，在生产上已发挥了显著的作用。这些中小型铁矿山，大都是在1958年大炼钢铁的群众运动中兴办起来的。两年来由于铁矿石的需要量不断增加，加以采矿工作面逐步向矿山的深部发展，迫切需要对这些矿山进行技术改造，以提高矿石产量、质量和采矿效率。为此，这些矿山今年都进行了技术改造工作，主要是修筑铁路，提高矿山外部和内部的运输能力；架设电路，为提高矿山生产提供动力；实行采矿掘进的机械化、半机械化等。目前，全国已经有一百一十多个矿山修了小铁路。六十多个矿山架设了电路，八十多个矿山修建了小电站，这些矿山已经基本上消灭了肩挑人背的笨重劳动，一部分矿山消灭了手工凿岩的操作。经过改造后的矿山，采矿效率较前大有提高。已经提前完成今年铁矿石生产计划的湖南省，在对中小型矿山进行技术改造的过程中，创造了一千多台土凿岩机，三十多台土电钻和一批土卷扬机、土索道等，大大提高了这些矿山的机械化和半机械化水平。全省有十多座矿山基本上消灭了手工凿岩和肩挑运输，10月份的矿石日产水平比年初提高了一倍多。山东省第一批进行技术改造的铁矿山，大部分矿外运输已经改用了小铁路，矿内的运输也免除了人挑肩担。
    据新华社武汉13日电　武汉钢铁公司大冶铁矿党委总结出边攻关、边巩固、边准备的工作方法，全矿从9月下旬以来出现了生产关键一个接一个地攻破，生产上升再上升的局面。10月份同9月份比较，全矿矿石的平均日产量增长57.3％，11月又比10月份增长13.25％。全矿准备的回采矿量也比9月份猛增三倍多。因此，既保证了武钢当前生产的需要，又为明年第一季度准备了充足的矿石。
    大冶铁矿党委在“集中优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人”和走上一步看下一步的思想指导之下，发动群众认真总结了本矿和外地组织“攻关战役”的经验，并制订出了长远的全面的开展“攻关战役”的规划，对生产中的关键问题分批分期地安排，集中优势力量一个一个地攻破，把攻关、巩固、准备三者紧密地结合起来。从今年9月下旬以来，他们采取这种工作方法连续开展三次“攻关战役”，都取得了显著效果。
    这个矿今年二、三季度生产不够正常，经认真分析研究，主要原因是回采矿量不足。因此，他们决定首先把开拓矿石储量丰富的狮子山九六水平和尖山一二八水平作为两大关键来突破。全矿把领导、设备配件、技术、政治工作等方面的力量集中到主攻关键上来。矿党委书记、矿长都上山到两个水平参加劳动，指挥生产，矿和车间70％的科室干部、工程技术人员，把行李搬上了山，实行轮流值班。全矿一半以上的电铲、穿孔机、汽车等设备，也开到这两个水平集中作业。各辅助工种的职工都为主攻关键服务。政治宣传员也集中到现场，讲形势、开展宣传鼓动工作。这样做之后，一周之内，狮子山九六水平的堑沟就被攻破，开始大量出矿。接着，四个多月没有打开的尖山一二八水平的堑沟也被打开。全矿储备的回采矿量由一个多月猛增到五个月。
    为了巩固成果，大冶铁矿一边组织攻关，一边就加强管理。结合休整，检查和总结攻破生产关键的具体经验和办法，把经验“配套成龙”，定为制度，纳入企业管理规程之内。例如，过去用穿孔机打眼，不少人认为深度不能超过十六米，有的只打十二米就放炮，以致根底整块大石头爆破不开，严重影响开采矿石的速度。这次，采矿车间采取“三结合”的办法，到现场多次进行穿孔深度试验，结果证明可以穿孔二十五米，爆破质量好，消灭了根底大块。于是，立即把这些新经验，经过领导批准纳入了操作规程，现在已广泛推行。他们还普遍健全了班、组和单机的领导核心，建立了民主管理制度，实行了以电铲为中心，包括穿孔机、汽车、凿岩、解炮、推土机、压风机等七个工种联合作业的协作制度。这样，既丰富了管理经验，又使攻关成果巩固下来。狮子山九六水平堑沟这一关攻破以后，这个水平的矿石日产量一直稳定在四千五百吨到五千吨。
    在集中力量攻关和加强管理、巩固攻关成果的同时，这个矿就抓紧作好下一步攻关的准备。如在攻破狮子山九六水平堑沟的过程中，就及时发现一一二水平是影响九六水平向前推进的关键，于是一方面抓紧主攻九六水平堑沟，取得彻底胜利，一方面从人力、设备、原材料供应、备品备件等各个方面为下一步攻破一一二水平堑沟作准备。结果，这条堑沟尽管高达十六米，困难很大，但是由于准备得早、准备得充分，结果比原定计划提前两天打通。一一二水平打通以后，接着又攻打狮子山西口的新关键。这样，就一个接一个地取得“攻关战役”的胜利。
