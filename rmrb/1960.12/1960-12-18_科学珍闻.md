Scientific Curiosities

New Wheat Varieties Cultivated in the Hexi Corridor
　　The Hexi Corridor has bred new wheat varieties numbered 4, 5, and 6, which are drought-resistant, early-maturing, and high-yielding.

　　To cultivate new wheat varieties suitable for the conditions in the Hexi region, the Zhangye Prefectural Agricultural Science Research Institute and the Zhangye Prefectural Agricultural Experiment Station, starting in 1954, used the 774 wheat variety, introduced from other regions, which is resistant to lodging and high-yielding but of poor quality, susceptible to loose smut, and not drought-resistant, as the female parent. They used local Bai Damai (White Oat), which has large grains, strong disease resistance and stress resistance but is prone to lodging and has weak tillering ability, as the male parent for sexual hybridization. After several years of hard work, they have achieved preliminary results. In 1959, three lines had stabilized and were preliminarily identified as Zhangye Nos. 4, 5, and 6. The hybrid offspring combined the advantages of both parents and overcame their shortcomings, with good quality, reduced loose smut, and significantly fewer sterile and spikelet numbers than 774. They are resistant to lodging and drought. Therefore, under high water and fertilizer conditions in 1959, 774 experienced moderate lodging, while the hybrid offspring experienced only slight lodging, yielding over 20% more than 774. This year, under severe drought conditions, the grains are still plump, yielding more than 774.

Wild Flax Hybridized with Oil Flax
　　Flax is the main oil crop in Gansu Province, mainly produced in arid mountainous areas. To avoid competing with grain and cotton for land, flax is mostly planted on hillsides and mountaintops. However, the current flax varieties used by farmers are not very stress-resistant, yielding only one crop per year, with a yield of only 30 to 80 catties per mu. To obtain an ideal new flax variety, the Economic Crops Research Institute of the Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences used the excellent characteristics of wild flax, such as high drought resistance, cold resistance, disease resistance, early maturity, multiple fruits, and multiple crops per year, and carried out multi-flower pollination sexual hybridization with local oil flax varieties, and has obtained the first generation. According to observations during the growth period, the fruits grown by the hybrid offspring with oil flax as the female parent are clearly smaller and more numerous than the non-hybridized fruits, approaching the characteristics of wild flax.

Yangtze River Fish Bred on the Northwest Plateau
　　The Lanzhou Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences broke with convention last winter and this spring by transporting Yangtze River fry from Wuhan to Lanzhou for semi-artificial incubation experiments, which have now been successful. In the first half of this year alone, it is estimated that 100,000 fry have been hatched and supplied to rural people's communes in various parts of Gansu for raising. This achievement not only shortened the incubation time but also further opened up new avenues for the development of aquaculture on the Northwest Plateau.

Evergreen Tomato Tree
　　In the greenhouse of the Liuquan Production Team of the Xiliugou People's Commune in Xigu District, Lanzhou City, there are two perennial tomato trees named "Ka De Da Hong". These were cultivated by veteran commune members Lu Yongliang and others in August 1958. For three years, they have been growing vigorously, with vines as thick as umbrella handles, plants over three meters high, with forty-four nodes, each fork bearing an average of four to five fruits. The fruits are perfectly round, bright in color, and have the advantages of thin skin, thick flesh, few seeds, and sweet taste. They can flower and bear fruit all year round. In the past two years, seventy-eight catties of tomatoes have been harvested. This year, the commune has prepared twenty-six greenhouses for large-scale cultivation. This initiative has opened up new avenues for scientific research on evergreen vegetables.

    河西走廊培育小麦新品种
    河西走廊选育出能够抗旱、早熟、丰产的四、五、六号小麦新品种。
    张掖专区农业科学研究所和张掖专区农业试验站，为了培育适合于河西地区条件的小麦新品种，从1954年开始，采用外地引进的抗倒伏、产量高，但品质差，易散发黑穗病，不能抗旱的774号麦种为母体，用当地穗粒大，抗病力和抗逆性强，但易倒伏、分蘖力弱的白大麦为父本，进行有性杂交。经过几年的辛勤劳动，目前已获初步成果。1959年有三个品系已经稳定，初步鉴定为张掖四、五、六号。杂种后代综合了父母本的优点，克服了父母本的缺点，品质好、黑穗病减轻，不孕和小穗数比774号大大减少，能抗倒伏和抗旱。因此，在1959年水肥条件高的条件下，774号发生中等倒伏，而杂种后代仅轻微倒伏，比774号增产20％以上。今年在大旱的情况下，仍然籽粒饱满，比774号增产。
    野生胡麻与油用胡麻杂交
    胡麻是甘肃省的主要油料作物，主要产地在干旱山区。为了不与粮棉争地，胡麻多种在山坡及山顶上，但是，目前农家的胡麻品种抗逆性不强，一年一熟，亩产不过三十到八十斤。省农业科学院经济作物研究所为了获得一个理想的胡麻新品种，利用野生胡麻的高度抗旱、抗寒、抗病、早熟、多果及一年多熟的优良特性，同农家油用胡麻品种进行了多花授粉的有性杂交，已获得第一代。据生育期中的观察，由油用胡麻作母本的杂交后代，长出的果实显然比未进行杂交的果实小而多，已接近野生胡麻的特征。
    西北高原繁殖长江鱼
    中国科学院兰州分院去冬今春打破常规把武汉长江种鱼运到兰州，进行半人工孵化试验研究，现在已经试验成功。仅今年上半年，估计已有十万鱼苗孵化出来，并已供应甘肃各地农村人民公社喂养。这一成就，不仅缩短了孵化时间，而且进一步为发展西北高原水产事业开辟了新的途径。
    四季长青的西红柿树
    在兰州市西固区西柳沟人民公社柳泉生产队的温室里，生长着两株名为“卡得大红”的多年生西红柿树。这是老社员芦永良等1958年8月培育出来的。三年来，它一直生长旺盛，藤蔓长得像伞柄那样粗，株植高达三米以上，有节四十四个，每个杈平均着果四至五个，果实形状正圆，色泽鲜美，具有皮薄、肉厚、籽少、味甜的优点。一年四季都能开花结果。两年多来，已收获西红柿七十八斤。今年这个公社准备了二十六间温室，进行大面积培育。这一创举为蔬菜四季长青的科学研究开辟了新的途径。
