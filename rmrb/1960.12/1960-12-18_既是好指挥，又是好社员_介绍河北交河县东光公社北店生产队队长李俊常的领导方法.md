    Not Only a Good Commander, But Also a Good Commune Member
    —Introducing Li Junchang, Captain of the Beidian Production Team, Dongguang Commune, Jiahe County, Hebei Province, and His Leadership Methods
    Jiao Hewen
    Li Junchang, the captain of the Beidian Production Team in Dongguang Commune, Jiahe County, Hebei Province, conscientiously implements the Party's policies, has a democratic style, consults with the masses on everything, and commands production in an orderly manner. Cadres and commune members alike praise him as a "good commander." Because of his effective leadership, the team's production and life are both well-managed.
    
    No Ambiguity on Policy Issues
    Li Junchang has been the production team leader since the spring of last year. How to command the team's production well? From his many years of experience as a small team leader, Li Junchang deeply realized that the Party's policies must be resolutely implemented. He said, "This is a universal key. A family may have a thousand locks, but the key is in one hand. Without this 'key,' the work of the whole team cannot be led well." Therefore, he often checks the implementation of policies and promptly solves problems in his work.
    
    September is a busy season for farming, and various agricultural tasks are particularly urgent. One evening, the production team's cadres held a meeting in the rain to discuss the next day's farm work. After talking back and forth, the most important task was to eliminate weeds by any means possible. Some people advocated drawing strong labor, livestock power, and tools from the small teams, concentrating them under the leadership of the production team leader for a concentrated assault. At this time, Li Junchang immediately stood up and said, "Wouldn't that disrupt the small teams' arrangements for farm work and labor allocation?"
    
    "It's about organizing large-scale cooperation!"
    
    "The method is very good! However, cooperation between small teams should be based on voluntary mutual benefit and equivalent exchange, without affecting each other's production..."
    
    "Isn't that too much trouble? We have a basic team ownership system here, we'll settle accounts together at the end of the year!"
    
    "But we also have 'four fixings' and 'three guarantees and one reward' policies for the small teams!"
    
    "Concentrating labor for a concentrated assault can be very efficient!"
    
    "If we don't implement the 'four fixings' and 'three guarantees and one reward' policies, unclear rewards and punishments will affect the commune members' enthusiasm for increasing production."
    
    After saying this, the individuals advocating disrupting the small teams' farm work arrangements were enlightened. Then, the small team cadres were brought in to jointly study and arrange the current farm work and specific issues related to organizing cooperation. As a result, the matter was handled in accordance with policy, and everyone was satisfied.
    
    "Respect the Authority of the Small Teams"
    
    In his work, Li Junchang is good at listening to opinions from below and never acts arbitrarily or takes over everything. In his own words, it means "respecting the authority of the small teams in everything." This is a fact. In the second small team, he is a well-known "commune member" who listens to commands when working and handles everything according to the rules. He always asks the small team leader for leave when attending meetings or going out, never leaving his post without permission. This autumn, he was plowing corn with the commune members in Zhuangxi when commune member Li Junchi said, "Captain, how has the team arranged the wheat on the alkaline land in the northwest this year?"
    
    "I'll listen to your opinion first! Old 'advisor'!" Li Junchang said with a smile.
    
    "My opinion is to plow it first, let it dry in the sun, and then plant it. This will be beneficial for transforming the alkaline land."
    
    "That's right, that's what the production team studied!"
    
    "But, look..." At this time, a commune member was sending a seed drill to the field, looking like he was preparing to sow seeds. Li Junchi continued, "The small team leader said to plant that wheat this afternoon. Wouldn't that make it more alkaline? The land that was just plowed hasn't been exposed to the sun for a single day... Hurry up and tell that commune member to take the seed drill back!"
    
    Li Junchang listened, pondered for a moment, and shook his head, saying, "No, I have to talk to Small Team Leader Li Songlin!"
    
    "Hey! Isn't everyone under your leadership? You can just say it!"
    
    "Each has their own authority, each has their own scope, we can't mess things up!" When he went home for lunch, he found Small Team Leader Li Songlin. "Songlin, how did you arrange the wheat for the alkaline land in the northwest?"
    
    Li Songlin said, "We'll start planting this afternoon, harvesting, plowing, and planting as we go!"
    
    "You'd better discuss it with the commune members again!"
    
    Li Songlin accepted the captain's suggestion and discussed it with the commune members again, finally changing his approach.
    
    "To Lead Soldiers, First Lead the Generals"
    
    In his work, Li Junchang also pays special attention to cultivating and improving the working ability of the small team cadres. This is called "To lead soldiers, first lead the generals."
    
    Li Junchang said that to lead the "generals" well, one must first understand their temperament. He is very familiar with the temperaments of the small team leaders. Li Songlin, the first small team leader, is positive, willing to work hard, and responsible. However, he is not good at relying on organizational strength in his work. For every little thing, he runs to all 23 households in the team himself. Therefore, whenever work is assigned, Li Junchang often repeatedly tells him to pay attention to collective leadership and rely on organizational strength. One day, the entire team planned to harvest sweet potatoes in a concentrated effort to prevent frost. The night before, Li Songlin went to each household himself to call people and explain the reasons. The next day, he got up early and went to the field. However, the two deputy captains were not very clear about this matter. He complained that the deputy captains lacked a sense of responsibility, and the two deputy captains complained that he "monopolized the work tasks himself." After Li Junchang discovered this problem, he called Li Songlin to his home to talk in the evening. At first, Li Songlin didn't understand. Later, Li Junchang asked him, "Is it better to have more mouths or more legs?" Li Songlin said puzzledly, "Doesn't a person just have one mouth and two legs? How can there be more?"
    
    "What if there are two people?"
    
    "Double."
    
    "What about three people?"
    
    "Double the amount of work."
    
    "That's right, the way you handled things today wasn't good. You can talk to the family, but you can't talk to the field; you can run here, but you can't run there. You urged people to go to the field at home, but the people who went to the field early didn't know what to do and were idle."
    
    "What do you say I should do? I can't be in two places at once!"
    
    "That's right, what if two people were handling this matter?" Li Songlin suddenly realized and found the two deputy captains, humbly reviewing his personal shortcomings. Finally, Li Junchang helped them establish a small team committee system, strengthening collective leadership, and dividing the work according to each person's expertise, assigning specific responsibilities to each, so that there was supervision and inspection at the right time. In this way, the team's production was even better.
    
    The Most Important Thing Is to Proceed from Reality
    
    Li Junchang did something like this in the spring that left a deep impression on people. Everyone praised his pragmatic work style.
    
    One day in April, he heard about an experience from another place: intercropping corn and millet can increase production. He wanted to promote this method, so he found his "advisors" Li Peijin, Wang Xihe, and Li Wanfu to discuss it together. These people are all old poor peasants with rich farming experience and relatively progressive thinking. "What do you think of intercropping corn and millet?" Li Junchang first raised this question. Everyone thought this was a new method and discussed it seriously. Li Peijin said, "This method won't work. What if we encounter pests? They'll eat the millet first and then the corn, and there's no way to remedy it, especially since both of these crops are prone to pests." Wang Xihe said, "Corn is tall, millet is short; corn roots are large, millet roots are small; the millet is bullied by the corn and can't grow." They all agreed that this method couldn't be promoted in this area. Finally, Li Wanfu suggested, "Both millet fields and corn fields can be intercropped with mung beans. One is in the sky, and one is on the ground, without affecting each other. This is a good way to increase production." Li Junchang thought to himself, "The higher-ups are calling for promoting advanced experiences in accordance with local conditions. This is being realistic!" As a result, he changed his original plan and promoted the method of intercropping mung beans in corn and millet fields, according to the opinions of the masses, increasing grain production.
    
    This autumn, when planting wheat, the team had a task of 400 mu, and it was planned to make 50% of it high-yield fields. At that time, some cadres in the team advocated integrated management, immediately encircling 200 mu of land in the southwest. Li Junchang, who was familiar with the team's plots of land, did not agree with this approach because 80 mu of corn were not yet ripe and could not be cleared; some were unsuitable for planting wheat due to low-lying terrain. However, some cadres still insisted on this opinion. In the evening, he held a forum for old farmers, inviting the team's cadres to participate. The commune members sharply raised the question: Why leave the cleared melon fields unplanted with wheat and insist on harvesting the green corn, wasting the grain that is about to reach our mouths? One person said one thing, and another person said another. Finally, in accordance with the opinions of the masses, the planting plots were determined, and the high-yield fields were marked out. Regarding the issue of jointly managed high-yield fields, Li Junchang went to discuss it with Small Team Leader Wang Anrong. Small Team Leader Wang Anrong questioned: If we want to engage in joint management, wouldn't that destroy the "four fixings"? Who does the authority ultimately belong to? In this way, from cadres to the masses, from the masses to the cadres, the cadres educated the masses, and the masses also educated the cadres. As a result, in accordance with the Party's policies, high-yield fields were marked out with the small team as the unit, changing the large-scale joint management approach, satisfying everyone, and improving the cadres' policy level.
    
    Leading by Example
    
    The commune members praised Li Junchang as a "reassuring captain." Li Junchang said, "Reassurance starts with heart." This sentence is the experience Li Junchang gained after becoming the production team leader.
    
    For several years, no matter what work he has done, he has always taken the lead in creating a model and has never left the front line of production. Taking this year as an example, from January to now, except for attending meetings and going on business trips, he has spent the rest of his time in the fields, accumulating a total of 1,600 work points. In order to guide production well, in addition to hiring old farmers as advisors, he also set up experimental fields for various crops. For the implementation of various new technical measures, he first conducted experiments in his own experimental fields, educating people with facts.
    
    As the day of the Beginning of Autumn approached, the commune Party committee issued a call: cornfields should be managed with a focus on category three seedlings, promoting the upgrading of category three seedlings to increase grain production. As soon as this call was issued, it encountered some ideological resistance. Some people said, "The idea is good, but it's too late." "There will be less rain in the future, and topdressing fertilizer won't work." Li Junchang then used the time he got up early and stayed up late to apply house foundation soil to a category three cornfield. In a few days, the corn turned from yellow to green and from weak to strong. At this time, he convened the production small team leaders and some commune members to hold a meeting in the field. People were inspired by the facts, changed their understanding, and took action.
    
    "To Lead a Cow, Pull Its Nose"
    
    "To lead a cow, pull its nose." Grasping the key at the front line runs like a red thread through Li Junchang's entire work. Whenever a work task arrives, he carefully considers the main problems involved, proactively grasps them, and conscientiously solves them.
    
    One day, he got up early and went to the field, seeing that the commune members of the first small team were smoking before starting work. Li Junchang knew that there must be a problem. He went over and chatted with them, and it turned out that their work points were set unreasonably, and the commune members had opinions. He immediately found the small team leader and helped them revise the labor quota. Grasping this matter, he checked the labor quota of the entire team and found that some farm work quotas in the second small team also had this type of problem. Then, he followed the vine to find the melon, finally finding the reason why each small team could not regularly adhere to the labor quota system: the small team leaders were not familiar with the strengths of each laborer and were not good at assigning work according to the person and using people according to the work. Therefore, he helped the small team leaders conduct a detailed ranking of the entire team's labor force, arranging farm work and assigning work according to each person's expertise, solving the problem of unreasonable labor allocation.

    既是好指挥，又是好社员
    ——介绍河北交河县东光公社北店生产队队长李俊常的领导方法
    焦合文
    河北省交河县东光公社北店生产队队长李俊常，认真贯彻执行党的政策，作风民主，遇事与群众商量，指挥生产有条不紊，干部和社员们全夸他是个“好指挥”。因为他领导有方，全队的生产、生活都搞得很好。
    政策问题半点也不能含糊
    李俊常从去年春天开始当生产队长。怎样指挥好全队的生产？李俊常从自己多年当小队长的经验中，深切地体会到：必须坚决执行党的政策。他说：“这是一把万能钥匙。家有千把锁，钥匙一手握，离开这把‘钥匙’，全队的工作便无法领导好。”因此，他经常检查政策执行情况，及时解决工作中的问题。
    9月是农事大忙的季节，各项农活格外紧张。一天晚上，生产队的干部们冒雨开会，研究第二天的农活。谈来谈去，最紧要的任务是：千方百计消灭草荒。有人主张抽调小队的强壮劳动力和畜力、工具，集中起来，由生产队长带领，进行突击。这时，李俊常立即站起来说：“这样作，不把小队的农活安排、劳力支配搞乱了吗？”
    “组织大协作嘛！”
    “办法是很好！但是，小队之间搞协作要在自愿两利、等价交换的基础上，互不影响生产，……”
    “还那么麻烦啊？咱们是基本队有制呀，年终一块算账吧！”
    “可是，我们对小队还有‘四固定’和‘三包一奖’的政策哩！”
    “集中劳力搞突击，工效可高哩！”
    “不执行‘四固定’和‘三包一奖’的政策，到时赏罚不明，就会影响社员的增产积极性。”
    经这么一说，个别主张打乱小队农活安排的人受到了启发。接着把小队的干部们找来，共同研究安排了当前农活和组织协作的具体问题，结果，事情办得符合政策，人人满意。
    “尊重小队的权力”
    李俊常在工作中，善于听取下面意见，从不自作主张，包办代替。用他自己的话来说就是：“遇事要尊重人家小队的权力。”这话是事实。他在二小队，是一个有名的干活听支配、事事按制度办的“社员”，每逢开会、出外全向小队长请假，从不擅离岗位。今年秋天，他在庄西和社员们一起刨玉米，社员李俊池说：“队长，西北碱地的麦子，今年队上是怎么安排的？”
    “我先听听你的呢！老‘顾问’！”李俊常笑着说。
    “我的意见是先耕，晒垡以后再耩，这样对改造碱地有好处。”
    “对呀，生产队上是这样研究的！”
    “可是，你看……”这时有个社员正往地里送耧，看样子是准备播种。李俊池接着说：“小队长说，今天下午就去耩那块麦子去。要这样不是越闹越碱吗？刚耕过的地，一天也没有晒……你赶快叫那个社员把耧运回去吧！”
    李俊常听了，沉思了一下，摇摇头说：“不行，我得找小队长李松林说说去！”
    “唉！谁不是在你的领导下呀，你说了行啦！”
    “各有各的职权，各有各的范围呀，不能乱来！”中午回家吃饭的时候，他找了小队长李松林。“松林，你们西北碱地的麦子是怎么安排的？”
    李松林说：“今天下午便开种，随收、随耕、随种嘛！”
    “最好你还是再和社员们商量商量！”
    李松林接受了队长的建议，又和社员们去商量，最后改变了作法。
    “要带兵先领将”
    李俊常在工作中，还特别注意培养提高小队干部的工作能力。这就叫“要带兵，先领将”。
    李俊常说，要领好“将”，先摸“将”的脾气。他对小队长们的脾气很熟悉。一小队长李松林，积极肯干，认真负责；但是，工作中不善于依靠组织力量，有一点点事情，他自己就跑完全队的二十三户。因此，每逢布置工作的时候，李俊常常常再三告诉他要注意集体领导，依靠组织力量。一天全队计划突击收甘薯，以防霜冻，头一晚上李松林自己到各户去叫人，说明原因。第二天自己起早就下了地；但是两个副队长对这件事却不很摸底。他埋怨副队长工作责任心不强，两个副队长又埋怨他“把工作任务自己独吞了”。李俊常发现这个问题以后，晚上他把李松林叫到自己家里来谈，开始李松林未想通，后来，李俊常问他：“人是嘴多了好呢，还是腿多了好？”李松林不解地说：“一个人不就是一张嘴、两条腿吗，再怎么个多法呢？”
    “要是两个人呢？”
    “多一倍。”
    “三个人呢？”
    “多两倍。”
    “对呀，像你今天这件事情，办得就不妙。说了家里，说不了地里；跑到这里，跑不到那里。你在家催人下地，可是早下地的人到了地里不知道怎么干，白闲着。”
    “你说怎么办呢？我又不会分身法！”
    “对呀，要是两个人来办这件事情呢？”李松林恍然大悟，找来了两个副队长，虚心地检查了个人的缺点。最后，李俊常又帮助他们建立了小队队委会的制度，加强集体领导，根据各人的特长，又作了分工，各守专责，到时有督促有检查。这一来，全队的生产搞得更好了。
    最要紧的是从实际出发
    春天，李俊常作过这么一桩事情，给人们留下了深刻印象，大家都称赞他的实事求是的工作作风。
    4月的一天，他听到外地有这么一个经验：玉米和谷子实行间作能增产。他想推广这个办法，便找到他的“顾问”李培金、王希和、李万福共同商量。这几个人都是老贫农，有丰富的种地经验，思想也比较进步。“玉米、谷子实行间作，这个办法怎么样啊？”李俊常先提出了这个问题。大家觉得这是个新办法，认真地讨论起来。李培金说：“这个办法不行，要遇见害虫怎么办？先吃谷子后吃棒子，无法补救，尤其是这两样庄稼都是爱生虫子的。”王希和说：“玉米高、谷子矮，玉米根大、谷子根小，谷子受玉米的欺负，长不起来。”一致认为这个办法在这地方推行不开。最后，李万福提出来：“谷子地和玉米地都可以间种小豆，它们是一个在天上，一个在地下，互不影响，这倒是增产的好办法。”李俊常一听，心里想：“上级号召因地制宜地推广先进经验，这就是实事求是！”结果，改变了原来的打算，按照群众的意见，推行在玉米、谷子地里间种小豆的办法，增产了粮食。
    今秋种麦子，全队四百亩的任务，计划搞50％的丰产方。当时，队上有的干部主张联片经营，在西南一下圈出二百亩地来。李俊常熟悉全队的地块，他不同意这种搞法，原因是：有八十亩玉米未熟，腾不出茬来；有的因地势低洼，不适合种麦。但是有的干部仍然坚持这种意见。晚上，他就召开老农座谈会，叫队上的干部一同参加，社员们尖锐地提出了问题：为什么放着腾出的瓜地不种小麦，偏要收青，糟蹋将要到嘴的粮食呢？你一言，我一语，最后终于依照群众意见定好了种植地块，划好了丰产方。关于联片经营丰产方的问题，李俊常又去找小队长商量。小队长王安荣提出质问：要搞联营，不就破坏了“四固定”吗？权力到底属于谁呢？就这样，从干部到群众，从群众到干部，干部教育群众，群众也教育干部，结果，按照党的政策，以小队为单位划了丰产方，改变了大片联营的做法，人人满意，干部也提高了政策水平。
    身先“士卒”搞样板
    社员们称赞李俊常是“放心队长”。李俊常却说：“放心先有心”。这句话是李俊常当生产队长后得出来的经验。
    几年以来，不论做任何工作，他都率先搞出样板，从来未离开生产第一线。以今年为例，从1月到现在，他除去开会和到外地出差以外，下余时间都是在田野里，一共作了一千六百个工分。为了指导好生产，他除聘请老农当顾问，还搞了各种作物的试验田。各项新的技术措施的推行，他都到自己的试验田里先行试验，用事实教育人们。
    将近立秋的日子，公社党委提出号召：玉米地要偏管三类苗，促三类苗升级，多打粮食。这个号召刚下来，遇到了一些思想阻力。有人说：“主意好，晚了。”“往后雨水稀少，追肥不管用了。”李俊常便利用起早恋晚的工夫，在一块三类玉米地里追施了房框子土。几天的工夫，玉米便由黄变绿，由弱变强。这时，他就召集了生产小队队长和一部分社员到地头开会，人们受到事实的启发，转变了认识，都积极行动起来。
    “牵牛要牵鼻子”
    “牵牛要牵鼻子”。到第一线上抓关键，像一条红线一样地贯穿在李俊常的整个工作当中。每一项工作任务到来，他都细致地考虑当中的主要问题，主动地抓住它，认真解决。
  一天，他起早下地，看见一小队的社员们未干活就先抽烟。李俊常一看，就知道其中一定有了问题。他就凑了过去，一拉家常，原来是他们的工分订得不合理，社员有意见。他立即找了小队长，帮助他们修订了劳动定额。抓住这一件事情，他就检查了全队的劳动定额。发现第二小队有的农活定额也有这类问题。接着，他又顺蔓找瓜往下追，终于找出了各小队不能经常坚持劳动定额制度的原因，是小队长不熟悉每个劳动力的特长，不善于因人派活，因活用人。因此，他便帮助小队长们对全队劳动力进行了一次细致的排队，根据每个人的特长，安排农活，进行派工，解决了劳动力支配不合理的问题。
