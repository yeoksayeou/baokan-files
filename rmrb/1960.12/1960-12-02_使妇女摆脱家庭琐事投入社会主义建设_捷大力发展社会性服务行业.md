Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 29th – Czechoslovakia is vigorously developing service industries in order to free residents, especially women, from household chores and allow them to devote more energy to socialist construction.

At present, there are more than 330,000 people working in 25,000 various service enterprises and organizations across the country to provide services to residents. In larger cities, service industry projects cover all aspects of residents' lives.

This year, laundries across the country will wash 20,000 tons of laundry for residents, and dry clean another 21,000 tons of clothing. Quick laundromats and mobile laundromats equipped with washing machines for residents' use have also been widely established in residential buildings. Service industries for cleaning and repairing homes are also gradually expanding. In some areas, residents have also spontaneously organized service stations. For example, residents of seven buildings in the 10th district of Prague have organized the original service personnel in each building to form a service station to take charge of keys and store sundries for residents. The service station is also equipped with vacuum cleaners, electric refrigerators, and other items for residents to use. The station is also staffed with repair workers to repair houses and electrical equipment for residents. Many factories, enterprises, and government agencies have opened canteens for their employees, and now 60% of employees can eat lunch in the canteen.

In rural areas, mobile retail stores are active in all areas, often delivering goods to the most remote farm households. During the busy farming season, mobile stores also bring food and beverages to the fields for sale.

    使妇女摆脱家庭琐事投入社会主义建设
    捷大力发展社会性服务行业
    据新华社布拉格29日电　捷克斯洛伐克正在大力发展服务性行业，以便使居民，特别是妇女从家庭琐事中脱出身来，以更大的精力投入社会主义建设。
    目前，全国大约有三十三万多人在二万五千个各种服务性企业和组织中为居民服务。在较大的城市里，服务性行业的项目包括了居民生活的各个方面。
    今年，全国的洗衣房将为居民洗衣两万吨，另外干洗衣服达两万一千吨。在各住宅大楼还普遍设立了供居民使用的备有洗衣机的快速洗衣房和流动洗衣房。为家庭打扫和修缮房屋的服务性行业也正在逐渐扩大。有些地区的居民还自动地组织了服务站。如布拉格第十区有七幢大楼的居民把原有的每幢大楼中的服务员组织起来成立了一个服务站，代替居民掌管钥匙、收藏杂物等。这个服务站并备有吸尘器、电气冰箱等供居民使用。站内还配备有修缮工人，为居民修房屋和电路设备等。很多工厂、企业和机关为职工开办了食堂，现在已有60％的职工可以在食堂吃午饭。
    在农村中，流动零售商店活跃在所有的地方，他们经常把货物送到最偏远的农户去。农忙期间，流动商店还带着食物和饮料到田间出售。
