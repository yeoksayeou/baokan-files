Wuxi Conscientiously Implements the Policy of Agriculture as the Foundation in Capital Construction
Meticulously Calculates to Save Construction Land
Chongqing Iron and Steel Metallurgical Design Institute Innovates Design to Save Large Amounts of Land

(Our Newspaper dispatch) Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, in accordance with the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, has adopted effective measures to conscientiously save land used for capital construction.

Since July, the inspection team specially organized by the Wuxi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, led by the负责人 responsible person of the Municipal Committee, has conducted three inspections of the city's capital construction land, inspecting more than 300 capital construction units. The vast majority of land requisitioned but not yet used for construction has been returned to the people's communes for cultivation; land that is within factory areas, scattered and inconvenient to return to the people's communes, has also been planted with grain or vegetables by the requisitioning units, which are responsible for paying agricultural taxes. According to the statistics of 55 units inspected in the second batch, out of 1,580 mu of land requisitioned but not used, 1,458 mu were returned to the people's communes for cultivation, and the remainder was also planted with crops by the requisitioning units.

The Wuxi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China organized the responsible persons and technical personnel of relevant departments to review the designs of capital construction projects under construction and not yet under construction in two batches. After reviewing and revising the design documents of 28 units and reducing some unnecessary building area, more than 800 mu of land can be saved. For example, the layout design of the Light Industry College, after appropriate modification, saves one-third of the land used compared with the original. The design of the water plant, due to the combination of short-term construction and long-term construction, modifies the plant layout, and can also save more than ten mu of land. Some construction projects of similar or neighboring enterprises can save a part of construction land after appropriate merging or collaborative use.

Wuxi City has also established and improved the land requisition approval system.

Wuxi City's work on saving land for capital construction is combined with the city's industrial rational layout work. The Municipal Party Committee decided that in future capital construction, it is necessary to make more use of the barren mountains, open spaces, and existing buildings in the surrounding towns of the urban area. Now, five industrial construction projects have moved their addresses to the surrounding towns to use barren mountains and open spaces for construction. These five factories can save a total of 1,100 mu of paddy fields.

(Our Newspaper dispatch) According to Chongqing Daily: The Chongqing Iron and Steel Metallurgical Design Institute has adopted the method of "three combinations" inside and outside the institute to carry out technological innovation and technical revolution in design content. Since August of this year, while ensuring the quantity and quality of design, through innovating the content of the design, the newly designed projects have saved thousands of tons of building materials, more than 400 mu of land building area, and reduced a large amount of earth and stone excavation compared with the past.

After the Party Central Committee issued the call to carry out the increased production and economy movement centered on grain and steel in August, the Party Committee of the Institute mobilized and organized all employees to seriously study and discuss it, and emphasized that: architectural design is the first barrier of capital construction, and it is not only directly related to the reduction of construction costs to make careful calculations to save building materials, labor, and land in the design, but also a major issue for the country to save wealth and support agriculture. In order to help designers learn from practical experience and lessons and better improve their ideological understanding, the Party Committee of the Institute also mobilized the masses to check for design waste, ensure production, and design errors, find key points, find reasons, find ideological roots, and expose and criticize some ideas of blindly pursuing large scale and foreign style divorced from reality. All employees unanimously expressed that they would firmly establish an overall perspective of more, faster, better, and more economical, and vigorously engage in technical revolution of design content to make design plans better adapt to the needs of national construction and development.

In order to do a good job in the revolution of design content, the design institute adopted the working methods of the mass line of "three combinations" inside and outside the institute. The internal "three combinations" are that leading cadres, technical cadres, and general staff members discuss and approve design schemes together. One project was previously compiled into dozens of schemes by a few people, and the problem of large earth and stone excavation was not solved; this time, because the general layout plan was handed over to the masses for discussion, and the leading cadres of the institute presided over several "three combinations" meetings, the technical key points, advanced seedlings, and decision implementation were tightly grasped during the discussion process, and everyone was organized to work together to encircle and suppress the key problem of earth and stone, reducing the amount of earth and stone excavation by more than 700,000 cubic meters. The external "three combinations" are the combination of design, production, and scientific research departments, going deep into the front line of production and designing at the production site. One project used the method of "three combinations" inside and outside the institute to conduct on-the-spot surveys at the production site, solving major technical problems such as the rational layout of phased construction, the distance between workshops, and the building coefficient. The area used was reduced by more than 300 mu compared with the original design, saving an investment of 2 million yuan.

    本报讯　江苏省无锡市根据国民经济以农业为基础的方针，采取有效措施，切实节约基本建设用地。
    7月以来，中共无锡市委专门组织的检查组，由市委负责人领导，对全市基本建设用地进行了三次检查，先后检查了三百多个基本建设单位。部分单位征收后还没有用于建设的土地，绝大部分已经交回人民公社耕种；因为在厂区内、零星分散不便交回人民公社的土地，也由征用单位种上了粮食或蔬菜，负责交纳农业税。据第二批检查的五十五个单位的统计，征而未用的一千五百八十亩土地中，交回人民公社耕种的就有一千四百五十八亩，其余也由征用单位种上了农作物。
    中共无锡市委组织有关部门的负责人和技术人员，对正在施工和尚未施工的基本建设工程的设计，分两批进行了审查。二十八个单位的设计文件经过审查修改，减少一些不必要的建筑面积以后，可以节约土地八百多亩。如轻工业学院的平面布置设计，经过适当修改，就比原来节省了三分之一的用地。自来水厂的设计，由于把近期建设和远期建设结合起来考虑，修改了厂区平面布置，也可以节约十几亩土地。一些性质相近或邻近企业的某些建设项目适当合并或协作使用以后，也可以节省一部分建设用地。
    无锡市还建立和健全了征用土地的审批制度。
    无锡市节约基本建设用地的工作，是同全市工业合理布局的工作结合进行的。市委决定，在今后的基本建设中，要多利用市区外围集镇的荒山、空地和原有建筑物。现在，已经有五个工业建设项目迁移地址，到外围集镇利用荒山、空地建设。这五个工厂共可节约稻田一千一百亩。
    本报讯　据重庆日报消息：重庆黑色冶金设计院采取院内、院外“三结合”的方法，大搞设计内容的技术革新和技术革命。今年8月以来，在保证设计数量和质量的前提下，通过革新设计内容，使新设计的工程比过去节约了数千吨建筑材料、四百多亩土地的建筑面积，减少了大量土石方开挖量。
    8月份，党中央发出开展以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动的号召以后，院党委发动和组织全院职工认真学习讨论，并且强调指出：建筑设计是基本建设的第一道关口，在设计上精打细算节约建筑材料、劳动力和土地，不仅直接关系到建筑成本的降低，而且是一个为国家节约财富和支援农业的重大问题。为了帮助设计人员从实践中吸取经验教训，更好地提高思想认识，院党委还发动群众查设计浪费、查确保生产、查设计错误，找关键，找原因，找思想根源，揭露和批判了某些脱离实际的片面求大求洋的思想。全院职工一致表示要牢固树立多、快、好、省的全面观点，大搞设计内容的技术革命，使设计方案更好地适应国家建设发展的需要。
    为了搞好设计内容的革命，这个设计院采用了院内“三结合”和院外“三结合”的群众路线的工作方法。院内“三结合”是领导干部、技术干部和一般工作人员一起讨论和审定设计方案。有一项工程过去由少数人先后编制了几十个方案，土石方开挖量大的问题一直没有解决；这次，由于将总图布置方案交给群众讨论，并且由院领导干部主持召开了几次“三结合”会议，在讨论过程中紧紧抓住技术关键、先进苗头、定案落实等主要环节，组织大家齐心协力围攻土石方的关键问题，使土石方开挖量减少了七十多万立方米。院外“三结合”是设计、生产和科学研究部门三结合，一起深入生产第一线，到生产现场设计。有一项工程由于采取了院内“三结合”和院外“三结合”的办法，到生产现场实地勘察，解决了分期建设的合理布置、车间间距、建筑系数等重大技术问题，使用地面积比原设计减少三百多亩，节约投资二百万元。
