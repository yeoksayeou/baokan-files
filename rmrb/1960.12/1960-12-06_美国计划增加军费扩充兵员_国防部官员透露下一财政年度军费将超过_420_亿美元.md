    U.S. Plans to Increase Military Spending and Expand Military Personnel
    Defense Department Officials Reveal Next Fiscal Year's Military Spending Will Exceed $42 Billion
    (Reported by this newspaper) U.S. Department of Defense officials have revealed that the U.S. government will continue to increase military spending and further expand its military in the next fiscal year, which begins on July 1st of next year.
    According to a November 30th dispatch from Washington by the *New York Times*, U.S. Department of Defense officials stated that although the U.S. government is going to "take austerity measures" to reduce the huge deficit in international balance of payments, they expect the current administration's "defense expenditure (i.e., military expansion and war preparation costs) budget proposed for the next fiscal year will exceed $42 billion," exceeding the level of military spending in 1960.
    The *New York Times* stated that Pentagon officials hinted that "the government will try to obtain a considerable supplementary appropriation" for the military authorities to use for military expansion and war preparation. The newspaper also predicted that the incoming President Kennedy, who has repeatedly advocated for a large increase in military spending, "will agree to this figure, or will formulate a new figure according to his own policies."
    At the same time, the *New York Times* also revealed that, according to current plans, the number of personnel in the U.S. armed forces will also be further increased. The Air Force personnel will increase from the current 815,720 to 825,000. The Navy and Army personnel will maintain a level of 625,000 and 870,000, respectively. Although slightly less than the current number, it is still higher than the number that had been planned for a larger reduction.
    According to the newspaper, the military financial plan drafted by the U.S. Department of Defense has entered the final stage. This plan will be included in the government's new annual budget message, which President Eisenhower will submit to Congress in January next year.

    美国计划增加军费扩充兵员
    国防部官员透露下一财政年度军费将超过420亿美元
    本报讯　美国国防部官员透露，美国政府在从明年7月1日开始的下一财政年度中将继续增加军费，进一步扩军备战。
    据《纽约时报》11月30日发自华盛顿的消息报道，美国国防部的官员表示，尽管美国政府为了减少国际收支巨额逆差而要“采取节约措施”，但是他们预期本届政府“为下一财政年度提出的防御开支（即扩军备战费用）预算将超过四百二十亿美元”，超过1960年度的军费水平。
    《纽约时报》说，五角大楼的官员暗示，“政府将设法取得一笔相当大的补充拨款”，来供军事当局扩军备战之用。这家报纸并且预测，曾经一再主张大量增加军费的下届总统肯尼迪“将同意这个数字，或是将根据自己的方针拟订新的数字。” 
    与此同时，《纽约时报》还透露，根据目前的计划，美国的三军人数也将有进一步的增加。空军兵员将从现有的八十一万五千七百二十人增加到八十二万五千人。海军和陆军的兵员将分别维持在六十二万五千人和八十七万人的水平。虽然比现有人数略为减少，但仍然超过曾经计划作较大削减的人数。
    据这家报纸报道，美国国防部拟订的军事财政计划已进入最后阶段，这个计划将包括在政府的新年度预算咨文中，由艾森豪威尔总统在明年1月间向国会提出。
