    Develop Animal Husbandry in High-Quality, High-Yield Areas
    Wang Duo
    Since 1958, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has initiated a great leap forward in the development of animal husbandry. This year, animal husbandry production has achieved a leap forward for three consecutive years. In these three years, the average net increase of livestock was 11%, an increase of 3.7% compared to the average annual net increase of 7.3% during the First Five-Year Plan. The quality of livestock has also improved significantly. By 1960, improved livestock accounted for 14.1% of the total number of livestock. Great progress has also been made in the construction of pastoral areas. More than 4.8 million mu of grassland have been improved throughout the region, and more than 3.54 million mu of feed bases have been established. In addition, great progress has been made in water conservancy construction, the construction of sheds, settlement of herdsmen, and reform of animal husbandry tools. In pastoral areas, the past single animal husbandry economy has developed into an economy with animal husbandry as the main component and multiple other components. Many valuable experiences have also been gained in mass movements and measures to increase and protect livestock in animal husbandry production. All these tremendous achievements are the victory of the Party's various guidelines and policies for developing animal husbandry under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the victory of the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and the victory of the Party's ethnic policies.
    However, judging from the development of animal husbandry production in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, there are still some shortcomings. In the development of animal husbandry production, the differences between regions and between advanced and backward units are still very large; the development of various livestock is not stable enough; in the leadership of animal husbandry work, some cadres have not completely overcome the idea of ​​disregarding animal husbandry; after the great development of animal husbandry, many problems have also emerged, which urgently require further strengthening of the leadership of the animal husbandry front, strengthening measures to increase and protect livestock, and accelerating the construction of pastoral areas. Therefore, the task currently facing us is how to summarize experience, build up momentum, and better realize the stable, comprehensive, and high-speed development of animal husbandry in the autonomous region in the excellent situation of the whole party and all the people running agriculture and grain in a big way. That is to say, we must, according to the policy of the whole party and all the people running agriculture and grain in a big way, attach importance to the development of animal husbandry, further strengthen the leadership of animal husbandry production, conscientiously summarize experience, resolutely implement the Party's General Line and various policies for developing animal husbandry, further give play to the superiority of the People's Commune, effectively grasp the characteristics and laws of animal husbandry production, rely on the enthusiasm of the broad masses, and vigorously carry out the eight measures for animal husbandry. This is very important for realizing the high-quality, high-yield development of animal husbandry production.
    Now, the whole country and the entire Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are carrying out a mass movement of the whole party and all the people running agriculture and grain in a big way. This movement will surely greatly promote the further development of animal husbandry production. Animal husbandry is an important part of agriculture. The whole party and all the people running agriculture in a big way inevitably includes running animal husbandry in a big way. Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. Grain is the foundation of the foundation. Increasing grain must increase livestock, "more livestock, more fertilizer, more grain," increasing livestock is increasing grain. This is easy to understand. Therefore, while the whole party and all the people are running agriculture and grain in a big way, we must also run animal husbandry in a big way.
    Animal husbandry in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region accounts for a large proportion in the agricultural economy and is one of China's important animal husbandry bases. Whether animal husbandry production can develop greatly is directly related to the great development of agriculture. The role of animal husbandry in the national economy will become increasingly prominent with the greater development of animal husbandry production; people's demands for animal products will also become increasingly urgent with the development of the social economy and the continuous improvement of people's living standards. The two major sectors of agriculture are crop farming and animal husbandry. The relationship between them is interdependence, mutual conditions, and mutual promotion. Comrade Mao Zedong profoundly demonstrated the dialectical relationship between agriculture and animal husbandry. Facts have proved that the development of animal husbandry production can promote the great development of agriculture, increase agricultural output value, provide draught animals and fertilizers for agriculture, accumulate funds, and expand reproduction; the development of agricultural production can also provide a large amount of forage and feed for livestock, effectively promoting the great development of animal husbandry production. With the great development of agriculture in the future, the area of ​​cultivated land will continue to expand, and the yield per unit area will increase year by year. It is bound to require animal husbandry to provide more draught animals and fertilizers for agriculture. Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously develop animal husbandry to meet the needs of agricultural development. Any disregard and relaxation of the leadership of animal husbandry production is wrong.
    To put animal husbandry in an important position and strengthen the Party's leadership over it, it is necessary to solve both ideological understanding problems and work leadership and work arrangement problems. At present, some working cadres have a unclear understanding of the relationship between agriculture and animal husbandry. For example, they think that "the national economy is based on agriculture," as long as grain is grasped, it doesn't matter even if animal husbandry is relaxed; or they put animal husbandry and agriculture in opposition, thinking that grasping animal husbandry will affect agriculture. This understanding is obviously one-sided and wrong. They did not realize the close relationship between agriculture and animal husbandry, did not understand the importance of the Party's policy that crop farming and animal husbandry must be carried out simultaneously, and did not understand the profound truth that the development of animal husbandry will inevitably promote the development of agriculture. Therefore, among cadres and the masses, it is necessary to universally and deeply conduct ideological education on the importance of animal husbandry production, the dialectical relationship of mutual dependence, mutual conditions, and mutual promotion between animal husbandry and agriculture, so that they can deeply understand that while the whole party and all the people are running agriculture in a big way, the corresponding development of animal husbandry production, the simultaneous implementation of crop farming and animal husbandry, and the close integration of agriculture and animal husbandry to promote each other can promote both the great development of crop farming and the great development of animal husbandry.
    We emphasize the development of animal husbandry, not that we use forces absolutely equally in any region and under any conditions; but we should focus on different regions and different seasons depending on the task of agricultural and animal husbandry production and different situations. Under the unified leadership of the Party committees at all levels, make reasonable arrangements according to the tasks of agricultural and animal husbandry production, and grasp animal husbandry as well as grasp agriculture.
    According to the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong's principle that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, grain is the key to agricultural production, pig raising is the head of animal husbandry development, the six domestic animals are prosperous, and crop farming and animal husbandry are carried out simultaneously, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee proposed a policy of stable, comprehensive, and high-speed development of animal husbandry production, simultaneous increase of livestock quantity and improvement of livestock quality, and simultaneous development of large and small livestock; according to the different conditions of agricultural areas, pastoral areas, and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, it has formulated policies on the socialist transformation of animal husbandry, and on correctly handling the relationship between the three-level ownership of the People's Commune, with the team as the foundation, in animal husbandry production, and correctly handling the policy of advocating and allowing members to raise a small amount of livestock and poultry under the premise of vigorously developing collective animal husbandry; protecting breeding females, breeding animals, draught animals, and various policies to reward and promote the development of animal husbandry. The practice of the past few years has proved that these guidelines and policies are correct.
    Stable, comprehensive, and high-speed development of animal husbandry is the general policy for the development of animal husbandry in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The core of this policy is to develop animal husbandry production more, faster, better, and more economically, and to realize the continuous leap forward in animal husbandry production. High speed is the fundamental requirement for implementing the Party's General Line in animal husbandry production; stability and comprehensiveness are the prerequisites for high speed. To achieve high speed, we must develop animal husbandry in a stable and comprehensive manner. The so-called comprehensive means that we must develop both large livestock and small livestock; we must increase both the number of livestock and improve the quality and increase the output of animal products; not only pastoral areas must develop animal husbandry, but also agricultural areas, semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, and industrial and mining areas and towns must also develop animal husbandry. Some comrades have an unclear understanding of the meaning of "comprehensive." In the development of animal husbandry production, they only focus on increasing quantity, and do not actively carry out breeding and variety improvement and strengthen feeding management to improve livestock quality; they attach importance to the development of small livestock, and do not pay attention to the active development of large livestock. In the development of large livestock, they only pay attention to the development of cattle, horses, and mules, and do not pay attention to the development of donkeys and camels; they are also not active enough in the development of pig and poultry production. It is right for some areas to focus on the development of key livestock depending on the time and place, but it is wrong to only focus on the key points and ignore the overall situation. The so-called "stable" is to require that the development speed of animal husbandry, under the current conditions, through efforts, be stabilized at a relatively high level. But it does not mean that there is absolute balance between years and between livestock species. In order to comprehensively develop animal husbandry, it is necessary to make comprehensive plans for the increase in the number and improvement in the quality of various livestock, and to grasp both the key points and the weak links and backward areas, so as to ensure the stable, comprehensive, and high-speed development of animal husbandry production.
    Increasing quantity and improving quality are the general requirements for the development of all production. Animal husbandry production must also increase quantity and improve quality simultaneously. At present, we do not have enough livestock, so it is very important to actively increase the number of livestock, but it is not comprehensive to only pay attention to the development of livestock quantity and ignore the improvement of livestock quality. Only by developing quantity and improving quality at the same time can we have real high speed and meet the needs of the increasingly developing national economy and the continuously improving requirements of people's living standards. Quantity and quality are a dialectical unity. Without a certain quality of quantity, the quantity will not be large; without a certain quantity of quality, the quality will not be high. Therefore, we must pay attention to both quantity and quality. While vigorously developing the number of livestock, we must focus on improving quality. Improving livestock quality is not only an important way to increase social wealth more, faster, better, and more economically, but also a major method to improve labor productivity, increase output value, and increase members' income. Our general requirement is: while increasing the number of livestock, we must strive to improve the quality of livestock; in the next few years, we must increase more livestock than now, greatly improve the quality of various livestock, realize improvement and breeding, and produce more animal products.
    To improve the quality of livestock, on the one hand, we must carry out breeding and variety improvement, and at the same time, we must improve feeding management. In variety improvement, we must overcome only emphasizing foreign varieties and ignoring the use of local good varieties; or only emphasizing improving varieties and ignoring improving management and management. Improving feeding management is an important way to improve livestock quality. If feeding management is good, livestock quality will gradually improve; on the contrary, the quality of good breed livestock will gradually decline due to poor feeding management. The so-called improving livestock quality is to improve livestock performance and the yield of animal products. Good performance means great draught power, fast speed, and strong adaptability; high animal products mean more meat, more milk, more wool, good wool, and good leather.
    The simultaneous development of large and small livestock, while developing pigs and sheep, vigorously developing large livestock, is not only an important aspect of improving the quality of the entire livestock, but also an urgent requirement for the continuous leap forward in agriculture. With the great development of agriculture, the expansion of cultivated land area, the improvement of cultivation quality, and the increase in the transportation volume of rural agricultural and sideline products, the shortage of draught animals has become more prominent. Therefore, vigorously developing large livestock to solve the problem of insufficient draught animals is an urgent task in the development of animal husbandry production. We must resolutely implement the policy of "self-breeding and self-raising, more than self-sufficient" instructed by the central government, strengthen the feeding management of large livestock, rationally use them, reduce deaths, strive to improve the breeding survival rate of large livestock, increase large livestock, and change the backward situation of insufficient draught animals. Developing pig raising is necessary to increase fertilizer and develop agriculture, and it is also necessary to increase meat production more quickly and meet market needs. In order to promote the development of pig raising, we must continue to implement the policy of simultaneous public and private raising. It is necessary to develop pig raising at all levels of the commune, and actively advocate and support member family pig raising. To gradually realize "mainly public raising," we must give play to the enthusiasm of the People's Commune and production teams, production teams, and canteens in pig raising. The pig farms run by the commune level must be self-run relying on the strength of the commune. Realizing the policy of "mainly public raising" requires a development process. Through development, the proportion of public raising is gradually increased, and the proportion of public raising must never be increased by compressing private raising. The correct method should be to develop the pig raising industry at all levels of the commune, and to develop both collective pig raising and member family pig raising, so as to ensure the great development of the pig raising industry. The development of poultry also requires this.
    In order to develop animal husbandry in high-quality and high-yield areas, whether it is agricultural areas, pastoral areas, or semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, we must conduct comprehensive planning and reasonable arrangements for the development of agriculture and animal husbandry, and make reasonable layouts for farmland and pastures. We must not only strive to improve agricultural production, but also cultivate and improve grassland and increase the yield of pasture. Rationally use pastures, comprehensively plan, strengthen leadership, rationally organize forces, and ensure that agricultural and animal husbandry production promote each other and develop together.
    In terms of measures for developing animal husbandry production, the eight measures of grass (feed), water, breeding, seed, protection, management, housing, and tools proposed by the Party are the crystallization of the experience of animal husbandry production in the country and the autonomous region in recent years, and are also the accumulation of long-term knowledge of herdsmen on the laws of animal husbandry production. Grass and feed are the food for livestock. Chairman Mao said: Plants are the food for animals. Grass and feed and water are the key to developing animal husbandry. In recent years, we have repeatedly emphasized storing grass and preparing feed, establishing and developing feed bases, improving grasslands, developing water conservancy, and ensuring livestock drinking water and irrigating feed land and arid grasslands in order to effectively solve the problems of water, grass, and feed. Breeding improvement is the central link in developing the number of livestock and improving the quality of livestock. No breeding, no reproduction, breeding but no pregnancy, birth but no protection will inevitably reduce breeding survival. The requirement of 100% survival rate for mothers is our general requirement for breeding survival. To achieve 100% survival rate for mothers, we require full breeding, full pregnancy, full birth, full survival, and full strength. Preventing and controlling livestock epidemics is an important measure for increasing and protecting livestock. More breeding survival and less death loss are the two basic factors for increasing the total livestock rate. Epidemics are the main cause of livestock deaths, especially the serious harm of internal and external parasites, which should arouse greater attention in various places. While strengthening prevention and control work, we must strengthen feeding management. Feeding management is an important measure to increase and protect livestock, and it is also a regular task of production. Good feeding management will make livestock fat and strong, which can enhance the ability to resist natural disasters and epidemics. Strengthening shed construction is to create material conditions for livestock to resist various natural disasters. Accelerating the basic construction of pastoral areas is a long-term fundamental measure to ensure the stable, comprehensive, and high-speed development of animal husbandry production, and it is a strategic policy to transform the current animal husbandry production into modern animal husbandry production in terms of material conditions and technical equipment. Realizing the mechanization and semi-mechanization of animal husbandry production is the central issue of pastoral area construction, and it is also a fundamental measure to improve animal husbandry labor productivity and solve the shortage of labor. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee has decided that it will basically realize the mechanization and semi-mechanization of pastoral area animal husbandry production in the next three or four years. Therefore, whether it is agricultural areas or pastoral areas, we should continue to strengthen the Party's leadership, mobilize the masses, and vigorously carry out the movement of tool reform. All new tools and technologies that can reduce labor intensity and improve labor efficiency should be actively manufactured and actively promoted.
    The eight measures for animal husbandry production are comprehensive measures to ensure and promote the great development of animal husbandry, they are closely related and interact with each other. They are major measures to transform and develop the natural conditions of animal husbandry, and they are also major measures to continuously struggle against nature in the process of production, and they are also major measures to promote the better development of living animals in the production process. Strengthening and improving the eight measures for animal husbandry will inevitably guarantee the greater development of animal husbandry.

    优质高产地发展畜牧业
    王铎
    从1958年以来，内蒙古自治区在发展畜牧业方面开创了一个大跃进的局面。到今年，畜牧业的生产，连续三年实现了跃进。这三年中，牲畜平均纯增为11％，比第一个五年计划期间每年平均纯增7.3％，增加了3.7％。牲畜的质量，也有显著提高，到1960年，大小牲畜改良占牲畜总头数的14.1％。牧区建设也有了很大发展，全区改良草场四百八十多万亩，建立饲料基地三百五十四万多亩。此外，兴修水利、修盖棚圈、牧民定居、畜牧业工具改革等等，也都有了很大发展。在牧区，由过去的单一的畜牧业经济，发展为以牧为主多种成分的经济。在畜牧业生产上，大搞群众运动，大搞增畜保畜措施等方面，也都取得了许多宝贵的经验。所有这些巨大的成就，是在毛泽东思想的指导下，党所制定的发展畜牧业的各项方针政策的胜利，是总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的胜利，是党的民族政策的胜利。
    但是，从内蒙古自治区畜牧业生产的发展情况来看，还有某些不足的问题。在畜牧业生产发展中，地区与地区之间、先进与落后单位之间的差别还很大；各种牲畜的发展不够稳定；在畜牧业领导工作中，某些干部轻视畜牧业的思想，还没有彻底克服；畜牧业大发展以后，也出现了许多问题，迫切需要进一步加强对畜牧业战线的领导，加强增畜保畜措施，加快牧区建设工作。因此，摆在我们当前的任务，是如何在全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的大好形势下，总结经验，鼓足干劲，更好地实现稳定、全面、高速度发展自治区畜牧业的问题。这就是说，必须根据全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的方针，重视畜牧业的发展，进一步加强对畜牧业生产的领导，认真总结经验，坚决贯彻执行党的总路线和党的发展畜牧业的各项方针政策，进一步发挥人民公社的优越性，切实掌握畜牧业生产的特点和规律，依靠广大群众的积极性，大搞畜牧业八项措施。这对于实现优质高产地发展畜牧业生产，是十分重要的。
    现在，全国和全内蒙古自治区，正在开展全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的群众运动。这个运动，必将大大促进畜牧业生产的进一步发展。畜牧业是农业的重要组成部分，全党全民大办农业，必然包括大办畜牧业在内。农业是国民经济的基础。粮食是基础的基础。增粮必须增畜，“畜多、肥多、粮多”，增畜就是增粮。这个道理是很容易理解的。因此，在全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的同时，必须大办畜牧业。
    内蒙古自治区的畜牧业在农业经济中占着较大的比重，又是我国重要的畜牧业基地之一。畜牧业生产能否大发展，直接关系到农业的大发展。畜牧业在国民经济中的作用，将随着畜牧业生产的更大发展，越来越突出；人们对畜产品的要求，也将随着社会经济的发展和人民生活的不断提高，越来越迫切。农业的两大部门，就是种植业与饲养业。它们之间的关系是互相依存、互为条件、互相促进的。毛泽东同志曾深刻地论证过农业和畜牧业的辩证关系。事实证明：畜牧业生产发展了，就能促进农业的大发展，增加农业产值，为农业提供耕畜、肥料，积累资金，扩大再生产；农业生产发展了，又能为牲畜提供大量饲草、饲料，有效地促进畜牧业生产的大发展。随着今后农业的大发展，耕地面积不断扩大，单位面积产量逐年提高，势必要求畜牧业对农业提供更多的耕畜和肥料，因此，必须大力发展畜牧业，以适应农业发展的需要。任何轻视和放松对畜牧业生产的领导，都是不对的。
    把畜牧业放在重要地位，加强党对它的领导，既要解决思想认识问题，又要解决工作领导和工作安排问题。当前，还有某些工作干部，对农业和畜牧业的关系认识不清。如认为“国民经济以农业为基础”，只要抓了粮食，即使放松了畜牧业也不要紧；或者，把畜牧业和农业对立起来，以为抓了畜牧业就会影响农业。这种认识，显然是片面的，是错误的。他们没有认识到，农业和畜牧业二者的密切关系，不懂得党的种植业和饲养业必须并举这一方针的重要意义，不懂得发展畜牧业必然会促进农业发展的深刻道理。因此，在干部和群众中，必须普遍地深入地进行关于畜牧业生产的重要性、畜牧业和农业互相依存、互为条件、互相促进的辩证关系的思想教育，使他们能够深刻地理解，在全党全民大办农业的同时，相应地发展畜牧业生产，实行种植业与饲养业并举，使农牧业密切结合，互相促进，既推动种植业的大发展，又推动饲养业的大发展。
    我们强调发展畜牧业，并不是在任何地区、任何条件下，都是绝对平均使用力量；而是应该根据农牧业生产的任务和不同情况，在不同地区、不同季节，因地因时制宜地有所侧重。在各级党委的统一领导下，根据农牧业生产任务做到合理安排，和大抓农业一样，把畜牧业抓好。
    根据党中央和毛泽东同志提出的农业是国民经济的基础，农业生产以粮为纲，发展畜牧业以猪为首，六畜兴旺，种植业与饲养业并举的方针，内蒙古自治区党委提出了稳定、全面、高速度发展畜牧业生产，增加牲畜数量与提高牲畜质量并举，大小畜并举的方针；根据农业区、牧业区、半农半牧区不同情况，制定了关于畜牧业的社会主义改造，和正确处理人民公社三级所有，队为基础在畜牧业生产上的关系的政策，正确处理大力发展集体畜牧业的前提下，提倡和允许社员饲养小量家畜家禽的政策；保护母畜、种畜、耕役畜，以及奖励和促进畜牧业发展的各项政策。几年来的实践证明，这些方针政策都是正确的。
    稳定、全面、高速度发展畜牧业，是内蒙古自治区发展畜牧业的总方针。这条方针的中心，是要多快好省地发展畜牧业生产，实现畜牧业生产的持续跃进。高速度，是在畜牧业生产中贯彻执行党的总路线的根本要求；稳定、全面，是高速度的前提。要实现高速度，就必须稳定、全面地发展畜牧业。所谓全面，就是既要发展大牲畜，也要发展小牲畜；既要增加牲畜数量，也要提高质量和增加畜产品的产量；不仅牧业区要发展畜牧业，农业区、半农半牧区和工矿、城镇，也要发展畜牧业。有些同志对“全面”的含义，认识不清。在发展畜牧业生产上，他们只顾增加数量，不积极进行良种选育、品种改良和加强饲养管理，提高牲畜质量；重视发展小牲畜，不注意积极发展大牲畜。在发展大牲畜中，他们又只注意发展牛、马、骡，不注意发展驴、骆驼；对猪、禽生产的发展，也不够积极。有些地区因地因时抓重点牲畜的发展是对的，但只顾重点忽视全面，却是不对的。所谓“稳定”，就是要求畜牧业的发展速度，在目前条件下，经过努力，稳定在比较高的水平上。但也不是说，在年度之间、畜种之间，绝对的平衡。为了全面发展畜牧业，必须对各种牲畜数量的增加和质量的提高，做出全面规划，既要抓重点，又要抓薄弱环节和落后面，以保证畜牧业生产的稳定、全面、高速度发展。
    增加数量、提高质量，是一切生产发展的总要求。畜牧业生产，也同样要增加数量与提高质量并举。当前，我们的牲畜还不多，积极增加牲畜数量是很重要的，但是，单纯注意牲畜数量的发展，而忽视牲畜质量的提高，是不全面的。只有发展数量与提高质量同时并重，才有真正的高速度，才能满足国民经济日益发展的需要和人民生活水平不断提高的要求。数量和质量是辩证的统一。没有一定质量的数量，数量也不会大；没有一定数量的质量，质量也不会高。因此，必须数、质量并举，在大力发展牲畜数量的同时，狠抓提高质量。提高牲畜质量，不仅是多快好省地增加社会财富的重要途径，而且是提高劳动生产率，增加产值，增加社员收入的主要方法。我们总的要求是：在增加牲畜头数的同时，努力提高牲畜的质量；要在今后几年内，比现在增加更多的牲畜，使各种牲畜的质量大大提高，实现改良化、良种化，生产更多的畜产品。
    提高牲畜质量，一方面要进行良种选育和品种改良，同时还必须改善饲养管理。在品种改良上，要克服只强调外来品种，而忽视运用本地良种；或只强调改良品种，而忽视改善经营管理。改进饲养管理，是提高牲畜质量的一个重要方法。饲养管理得好，牲畜质量就会逐步提高；反之，良种牲畜的质量，也会因为饲养管理不好而逐渐下降。所谓提高牲畜质量，就是要提高牲畜的性能和畜产品的产量。性能好就是挽力大，速度快，适应性强；畜产品高，就是肉多、乳多、毛多、毛好、皮好。
    大小畜并举，在发展猪、羊的同时，大力发展大牲畜，这既是提高整个牲畜质量的一个重要方面，又是农业不断跃进的迫切要求。随着农业的大发展，耕地面积的扩大，耕种质量的提高，农村农副产品的运输量增加，耕役畜不足，更加显得突出了。因此大力发展大家畜，解决耕役畜不足问题，是发展畜牧业生产上一项迫切任务。必须坚决贯彻执行中央指示的“自繁自养，自给有余”的方针，加强大家畜的饲养管理，合理使役，减少死亡，努力提高大家畜的繁殖成活率，增殖大牲畜，改变耕畜不足的落后局面。发展养猪事业，是增加肥料，发展农业所必需的，也是更快地增加肉类产量，供应市场需要所必需的。为了促进养猪事业的发展，必须继续贯彻执行公私养并举的方针。既要发展公社各级养猪，又要积极提倡、扶持社员家庭养猪。逐步实现“以公养为主”，必须发挥人民公社和生产队、生产小队、食堂各方面养猪的积极性。公社一级办的养猪场，必须依靠公社的力量自办。实现“公养为主”的方针，需要有个发展过程。通过发展，逐步提高公养比重，也绝不能用压缩私养的办法来达到增加公养比重的目的。正确的办法，应该使公社各级养猪事业都有发展，集体养猪和社员家庭养猪都有发展，以保证养猪事业的大发展。发展家禽也需要这样。
    为了优质高产地发展畜牧业，无论农区、牧区、半农半牧区，都必须对发展农业和发展畜牧业进行全面规划、合理安排，对农田牧场，做出合理的布局。既要努力提高农业生产，又要培养和改良草场，增加牧草的产量。合理使用牧场，全面规划，加强领导，合理组织力量，保证农牧业生产互相促进，共同发展。
    在发展畜牧业生产的措施方面，党所提出的草（料）、水、繁、种、保、管、舍、工等八项措施，是全国和自治区几年来畜牧业生产的经验的结晶，也是长期以来牧民对于畜牧业生产的规律性知识的积累。草料是牲畜的粮食。毛主席说：植物是动物的粮食。草料和水是发展畜牧业的纲。几年来，我们一再强调贮草、备料，建立和发展饲料基地，改良草原，开发水利，保证牲畜饮水和灌溉饲料地和干旱草原，就是为了有效地解决水草、饲料问题。配种改良是发展牲畜数量、提高牲畜质量的中心环节。不配种、不繁殖，配而不孕、生而不保，必然减少繁殖成活。百母百仔的要求，就是我们对繁殖成活的总要求。实现百母百仔，就要求全配、全孕、全生、全活、全壮。防治畜疫是增畜保畜的重要措施。繁殖成活多、死亡损失少，是提高牲畜总增率的两个基本因素。疫病是造成牲畜死亡的主要原因，尤其内外寄生虫为害严重，应引起各地更大的注意。加强防治工作的同时，必须加强饲养管理。饲养管理是增畜保畜的重要措施，又是生产的经常性的工作。饲养管理得好，牲畜就膘肥体壮，可以增强抗御自然灾害和疫病的能力。加强棚圈建设，是为牲畜抵抗各种自然灾害创造物质条件。加速牧区的基本建设，是保证畜牧业生产稳定、全面、高速度发展的一项长远的根本措施，是把现在的畜牧业生产，从物质条件和技术装备方面，改造成为现代化畜牧业生产的战略方针。实现畜牧业生产的机械化和半机械化，是牧区建设的中心问题，也是提高畜牧业劳动生产率、解决劳力不足的根本措施。内蒙古自治区党委已经决定，要在今后三、四年内，基本实现牧区畜牧业生产的机械化和半机械化。因此，无论农业区或牧业区，都应该继续加强党的领导，发动群众，大搞工具改革运动。凡是能够减轻劳动强度、提高劳动效率的新工具、新技术，都应当努力制造、积极推广。
    畜牧业生产的八项措施，是保证和促进畜牧业大发展的全面措施，它们是密切相关、互为作用的。它们是改造发展畜牧业的自然条件，是发展生产过程中不断向自然斗争的重大措施，又是人们在生产过程促进有生命的动物更好地发展的重大措施。加强和提高畜牧业八项措施，必然会保证畜牧业的更大发展。
