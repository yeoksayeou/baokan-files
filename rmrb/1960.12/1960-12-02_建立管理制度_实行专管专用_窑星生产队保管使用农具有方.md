    Establishing Management Systems and Implementing Specialized Use:
    Yaoxing Production Team Effectively Manages and Uses Farm Tools

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Yaoxing Production Team of Jinshi Commune in Gongan County, Hubei Province, while repairing, supplementing, and reforming farm tools, earnestly strengthens leadership over their use and management, ensuring fewer damaged tools, convenient use, reduced expenditures, and promotion of agricultural production for the team.

    In the past two years, with the development of agricultural production, the number of publicly owned and used farm tools in this team has increased annually. Furthermore, in deep plowing, sowing, ditching, cultivating, water-pumping, and transportation, many new and improved farm tools have been adopted according to local conditions. Because the team consistently combines the repair, supplementation, and reform of farm tools with their use and management, and earnestly strengthens leadership over their use and management, there has been very little damage to farm tools in the past two years. Last year, the total labor cost for repairing farm tools was equivalent to only seventy-three standard workdays, and there was even a surplus of sixty yuan in maintenance expenses. Although the use of farm tools has been greater this year due to the prolonged drought and the expansion of cultivated land through reclamation, calculations up to the end of October show that the average maintenance cost of farm tools per mu of land is only one or two fen.

    Strengthening leadership and implementing policies are important guarantees for the team's effective use and management of farm tools. In the production team, a deputy team leader is responsible for the management of farm tools, while in the smaller teams, the deputy team leader responsible for assigning farm work is in charge. Farm tools are assigned on a fixed contract basis to the small teams, and are not arbitrarily transferred. When implementing the "three guarantees" system in agricultural production, the repair costs and repair workers for farm tools are also fixed in advance, strengthening the commune members' sense of responsibility for cherishing farm tools. At the same time, the team adheres to the evaluation of work and recording of points, and implements mutually beneficial policies, establishing detailed work-point recording methods for managing and oiling farm tools. In terms of preparing farm tools, the team always repairs and supplements them in advance, taking care of these tasks during slack periods so that they are ready for use during busy periods, without delaying agricultural work. Before the autumn planting this year, through assessment and accounting, it was determined that ten hoes, two wall-mounted ploughs, and one ten-row strip seeder needed to be added. These were cleaned and purchased in advance, ensuring that they were fully prepared when autumn planting began on October 19, thus guaranteeing production needs. During autumn planting, carpenters were sent down to repair tools as soon as they broke, so that the farm tools could fully exert their due effectiveness.

    Establishing systems and implementing specialized management and use have greatly improved the efficiency of farm tool utilization. Each small team in the production team has a storage warehouse, and farm tools are washed, dried, and stored in the warehouse when not in use. The team also ensures centralized management during normal times, and whoever uses a tool during the period of use is responsible for its management; when people go to the fields, the tools go to the fields, and when people return, the tools return. The use and management of waterwheels are handled through a system of "people contracting for wheels and wheels contracting for land." In the use of farm tools, the team also pays attention to rationally arranging labor, so as to bring into play the commune members' special skills. For example, experienced commune members who are skilled at plowing neatly and carefully are assigned to specialize in using oxen and whips, and the plows, harrows, and other farm tools are also entrusted to them. Commune members become familiar with the "temperament" of the farm tools they use, and therefore cherish them even more, and can repair minor problems themselves. Therefore, of the 167.5 yuan planned for maintenance costs this year, only 70.5 yuan had been used by the end of October. In order to extend the service life of farm tools, each small team has also arranged for experienced veteran farmers to specialize in oiling and washing farm tools when farm work is less busy. This rotational oiling and washing method both maintains the farm tools and does not delay production.

    In addition, the team also pays attention to regular evaluations and strengthens inspections, educating commune members to cherish public property. The production team conducts year-end evaluations with the participation of management cadres, work group leaders, and skilled operators from each small team. Through these evaluations, experiences are exchanged, and reward and compensation systems are implemented.

### 建立管理制度　实行专管专用  窑星生产队保管使用农具有方

    建立管理制度　实行专管专用
    窑星生产队保管使用农具有方
    本报讯　湖北公安县金狮公社窑星生产队，在修理、补充、改革农具的同时，切实加强对使用、保管工作的领导，保证了全队农具损坏少，使用方便，节省了开支，促进了农业生产。
    近两年来，这个队随着农业生产的发展，公有公用的农具逐年增加。并且在深耕、播种、开沟、中耕、车水以及运输等方面，因地制宜采用了不少新式的改良农具。由于这个队一贯把农具的修理、补充、改革同使用、保管工作紧密结合起来，切实加强对使用、保管工作的领导，近两年来农具损坏很少。全生产队去年修理农具所用的木工，只折合七十三个标准工，维修费还节余六十元。今年抗旱时间长，加上开荒扩大耕地面积，使用农具虽然多一些，但到10月底计算，平均每亩田农具维修费只一、二分钱。
    加强领导，贯彻执行政策，是这个队用好管好农具的重要保证。农具保管工作在生产队由一个副队长负责，小队由派农活的副队长负责。小队农具实行固定包干，不随便调动。在农业生产实行“三包”时，就把农具的修理费、修理工一起定好，加强社员爱护农具的责任心。同时，坚持评工记分，执行互利政策，管理和油洗农具都定出了细致的记工办法。在农具准备工作方面，总是事先修理好补充好，闲时办，忙时用，不误农时。今年秋种前，通过摸底算账，需要增添十个鏆头、两个壁耳、一部十行条播器，事先就进行清理和购买，于10月19日开始秋种时准备齐全，保证了生产需要。在秋种中，又派木工下去随坏随修，使农具充分发挥应有的效能。
    建立制度，专管专用，大大提高了农具的使用效率。这个队的每个小队都有保管仓库，农具不用时洗净晾干，入库收藏。还做到了平时集中保管，使用期间谁用谁管，人下田农具下田，人回农具回。对水车的使用和保管，是采取人包车、车包田的办法。在农具使用中，还注意了合理安排劳动力，以发挥社员们的特长。例如，在确定整田精细而且有经验的社员专门掌鞭用牛时，就把犁、耙等农具也交给他们负责。社员们对自己所用的农具摸熟了“脾气”，就更加爱护了，一般的小毛病都可以自己修理。所以，这个队今年计划的维修费一百六十七元五角，到10月底，只用了七十元五角。为了延长农具使用年限，各个小队还安排了有经验的老农，在错开农活情况下专门油洗农具。这种轮换油洗的办法，既保养了农具，又不耽误生产。
    此外，这个队还注意了定期评比，加强检查，对社员进行爱护公物的教育。生产队在年终评比时，是由各小队管理干部、作业组长、操作能手等共同参加。通过评比，既交流了经验，又执行了奖赔制度。
