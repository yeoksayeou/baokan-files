Brothers Countries' Advanced Science and Technology

    Polish scientists have trial-produced a device that can help the blind "see" certain things to some extent.

    This device, which can be worn on the head, has a photosensitive device composed of eighty photoelectric tubes, as well as eighty amplifiers and "compressors." The "compressor" is worn on the blind person's forehead. The photoelectric tubes convert light waves into electricity, which is amplified by the amplifiers and transmitted to the "compressor." The blind person can sense the presence of objects based on the different pressures of each part of the "compressor." Using this device can not only distinguish whether there are obstacles ahead when walking, but also, after a period of practice, can distinguish medium-sized white objects, such as plates, cups, and round cardboard.

    The developers believe that this device is only a preliminary trial production, and there are still many shortcomings, and it cannot be practically used at present.

    盲人的助手
    波兰科学家试制成了一种可以帮助盲人在一定程度上能“看”到某些东西的装置。
    这种可以戴在头上的装置有一个由八十个光电管组成的感光装置，还有八十个放大器和“压紧器”。“压紧器”戴在盲人前额上。光电管把光波变成电，通过放大器放大后分别传到“压紧器”上。盲人根据各部分“压紧器”压力的不同就可以感受到物体的存在。使用这种装置不仅可以在走路时辨别前面有无障碍，而且在经过一个时期练习以后还可以辨出中等大小的白色物件，如盘子、杯子、圆纸板等。
    试制者认为，这个装置还只是初步试制，还有许多缺点，目前还不能实际使用。
