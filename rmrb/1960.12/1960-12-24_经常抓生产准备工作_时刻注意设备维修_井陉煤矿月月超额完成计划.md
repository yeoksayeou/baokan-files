Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 23rd: The Jingxing Coal Mine in Hebei Province consistently pays attention to grasping production preparation and maintaining mechanical and electrical equipment, achieving both leap forward and balanced production. Since the beginning of this year, it has exceeded the state plan every month and every ten-day period. By December 12th, it had completed the annual state plan nineteen days ahead of schedule. Raw coal production completed 100.15% of the annual state plan, tunneling footage completed 105.18%, overall efficiency increased by 4.76% compared to the state plan, timber consumption decreased by 11.61% compared to the state plan, and the quality of coal also reached the state-specified standards.

Jingxing Coal Mine is a nationally renowned large-scale primary coking coal mine, supplying a large amount of high-quality coking coal to key iron and steel enterprises every year. This year, the state assigned the mine a coal production plan that was more than 600,000 tons higher than last year's actual annual output, making the production task very heavy. Jingxing Coal Mine is also an old mine that has been mined for decades, with complex geological conditions underground, and no new mine was put into production this year. Under these circumstances, their main experience in achieving the leap forward plan and balanced production is to consistently pay attention to grasping production preparation, especially tunneling work; and to consistently pay attention to the maintenance of mechanical and electrical equipment, to achieve safe production and improve equipment utilization, thereby tapping the production potential of the old mine.

The coal seams in Jingxing Coal Mine are mostly honeycomb-like and banded, with many faults and relatively complex geological conditions, and the operating life of the working faces is short. In order to achieve a balanced and sustained leap forward, correctly grasp the appropriate ratio between coal mining and tunneling, and ensure the connection of working faces to continuously expand production capacity, the mine's Party committee gathered the opinions of the masses and proposed "determining tunneling by production, ensuring production by tunneling, and giving equal importance to production and tunneling" as a guiding ideology. Under the guidance of this ideology, all mines in the coal mine reorganized their labor organization, established professional tunneling areas and teams, and the number of tunneling teams was often maintained at about half of the total number of mining and tunneling teams in the mine. At the same time, from the bureau to the mine, a Party committee secretary, deputy director, mine manager, and engineer were specially assigned to take charge of tunneling production preparation work, and regular meetings were held with the participation of mining, tunneling, transportation, and electromechanical maintenance departments to organize production balance and formulate quarterly, monthly, and ten-day plans for coal mining and tunneling. Each mining and tunneling team also implemented coal mining and tunneling progress indicator charts, so that every coal mining and tunneling worker knew the role of their production tasks in ensuring mining and tunneling connection and completing the national coal production plan of the entire area, mine, and bureau. Each tunneling area also established Party branches by shift, reorganized the leading backbone of the teams, and strengthened the ideological and political work and production organization and management work at the tunneling grassroots level. Through a series of improvements in production management, the mine not only increased raw coal production but also maintained the recoverable period of obtained coal volume at more than four months, thereby ensuring mining and tunneling connection and exceeding the national coal mining plan every month and every ten-day period.

The experience of Jingxing Coal Mine proves that frequently maintaining mechanical and electrical equipment, achieving safe production, and improving the utilization rate of mining, tunneling, and transportation equipment are the main keys to improving the production capacity of this old mine. In order to solve this key problem, the Party committee of Jingxing Coal Mine educated workers to establish the idea of ​​safe production to ensure high yield through methods such as inserting red flags, establishing pacesetters, and frequently summarizing the experience of mechanical and electrical equipment maintenance. A vigorous upsurge of learning from and catching up with safety pacesetter Yu Siyuan was launched throughout the mine. Yu Siyuan is an electric chute driver, and the old electric chute he used was regarded as a "broken-down old oxcart" that was about to be scrapped. However, after his careful maintenance and repair, it has been running safely for more than nine hundred days without any accidents. Through hard work, he has explored a set of operating experience for using and maintaining electric chutes. In the movement to learn from and catch up with Yu Siyuan, a large number of "Yu Siyuan-style" safety production pacesetters emerged in various mines. More than half of the more than 600 workers in electric chute driving and electromechanical maintenance and other types of work in one mine reached Yu Siyuan's operating level. The mine basically eliminated mechanical and electrical equipment accidents of more than 20 minutes, increasing the average coal transportation volume per hour per electric chute in the mine by 25%. Various mines also mobilized workers to establish and improve a complete set of mechanical and electrical equipment maintenance systems combining regular inspections and daily maintenance. The workers of the Third Mine established and improved the daily maintenance system for mechanical and electrical equipment accident registration, analysis, and shift handover, as well as a regular inspection system, which greatly improved the utilization rate of the equipment. Since entering the fourth quarter, with a sharp increase in raw coal production of more than 50%, the equipment capacity still meets the needs of production growth. While establishing and improving the mechanical and electrical maintenance system, the First Mine also vigorously grasped the production and repair of equipment parts and spares. Many scrapped machines and equipment were put back into production after being repaired and fitted. Therefore, the mine originally planned to add 326 new machines, but only added 227 units.

Because the mine did a good job in production preparation and mechanical and electrical equipment maintenance, and production was proactive, it also achieved a combination of work and rest while achieving a leap forward in production, and the workers have maintained high labor enthusiasm this year. Now, all the mine's workers are working hard to increase the production of more than 300,000 tons of primary coking coal for the country this year.

    经常抓生产准备工作  时刻注意设备维修
    井陉煤矿月月超额完成计划
    据新华社天津23日电　河北省井陉煤矿经常注意抓紧生产准备工作和机电设备的维护工作，生产作到了既跃进又均衡。今年以来月月旬旬都超额完成国家计划。到12月12日，已提前十九天完成全年国家计划。原煤产量完成了全年国家计划的100.15％，掘进进尺完成105.18％，全员效率比国家计划提高4.76％，坑木消耗比国家计划降低11.61％，煤的质量也达到了国家规定的指标。
    井陉煤矿是全国著名的大型主焦煤矿，每年供给重点钢铁企业大量优质炼焦煤。今年，国家给这个矿下达的产煤计划指标比去年实际年产量增加了六十多万吨，生产任务很重。井陉煤矿又是一座开采了几十年的老矿井，井下地质条件复杂，今年也没有新建矿井投入生产。在这种情况下，他们实现跃进计划和均衡生产的主要经验，就是经常注意抓紧生产准备工作，特别是掘进工作；经常注意机电设备的维护工作，做到安全生产，提高设备的利用率，从而挖掘出了老矿井的生产潜力。
    井陉煤矿多是鸡窝式的带状煤层，断层多，地质条件比较复杂，工作面开采期限短，为了实现均衡地持续跃进，正确掌握采煤与掘进的适当比例关系，保证工作面衔接，来不断扩大生产能力，这个矿党委集中了群众的意见，提出“以产定掘、以掘保产、产掘并举”作为指导思想。全矿各矿井在这个思想指导下，重新调整了劳动组织，设立了专业掘进区、小组，掘进小组的数量经常保持占全矿采、掘小组的一半左右。同时，从局到矿都由一名党委书记、副局长、矿长、工程师专门抓掘进生产准备工作，并且定期召开有采煤、掘进、运输、机电维护等部门参加的组织生产平衡的会议，制定季、月、旬采煤和掘进的计划。各采煤、掘进小组也实行采煤、掘进进度指标图表，使每个采煤、掘进工人都知道自己所担负的生产任务对保证采掘衔接和完成全区、矿、局国家产煤计划的作用。各掘进区还按班成立了党支部，重新调整了小组领导骨干，加强了掘进基层的思想政治工作和生产组织管理工作。这个矿经过一系列的生产管理工作的改进，既提高了原煤产量，又使获得煤量的可采期经常保持在四个月以上，从而保证了采掘衔接，月月旬旬超额完成了国家采煤计划。
    井陉煤矿的经验证明，经常维护好机电设备，做到安全生产，提高采煤、掘进、运输等设备的利用率，是提高这个老矿生产能力的主要关键。为了解决这个关键问题，井陉煤矿党委通过插红旗、树标兵和经常总结机电设备维修工作经验等方法，教育职工树立了安全生产保高产的思想。全矿轰轰烈烈地开展了一个学、赶安全标兵于四元的热潮。于四元是电溜子司机，他使用的一台残旧电溜子，被人看成是要报废的“老牛破车”。可是，经过他精心的维护、修理，已安全运转九百多天，没有发生过一次事故。他经过刻苦钻研，摸索出了使用和维护电溜子的一套操作经验。各矿在学、赶于四元运动中，涌现出了大批“于四元式”的安全生产标兵。一矿的电溜子司机、机电维修等工种的六百多名工人中，就有一半以上达到了于四元的操作水平，全矿基本上消灭了二十分钟以上的机电设备事故，使全矿平均每台电溜子每小时运煤量提高了25％。各矿还发动工人建立和健全了定期检修和日常维护相结合的一整套机电设备维修制度。三矿职工建立和健全了机电设备事故登记、分析和交接班等日常维护的制度，以及定期检修的制度，大大提高了设备的利用率。进入第四季度以来，在原煤产量猛增50％以上的情况下，设备能力仍满足了生产增长的需要。一矿在建立和健全机电维修制度的同时，还大抓设备配件、备件的生产和修配，许多报废了的机器设备经过修配后又投入了生产。因此，这个矿原计划增添三百二十六台新机器，只增加了二百二十七台就够了。
    这个矿由于生产准备做得好，机电设备维护得好，生产主动，因此，在实现生产跃进的同时，也做到了劳逸结合，职工们今年一直保持着高昂的劳动热情。现在，全矿职工正在为今年给国家增产三十多万吨主焦煤而努力。
