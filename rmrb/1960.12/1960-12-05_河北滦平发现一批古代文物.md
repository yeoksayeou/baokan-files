Hebei Luanping Discovers a Batch of Ancient Cultural Relics

    The Hebei Provincial Cultural Bureau's Cultural Relics Work Team discovered an ancient site covering an area of more than 30,000 square meters near Shili Changliang in Hushiha Commune, Luanping County. Among the unearthed cultural relics are bricks and tiles, porcelain tiles, pottery cups, bronze mirrors, and agate beads from the Liao and Jin dynasties, Song Dynasty copper coins, Han Dynasty cord-patterned pottery shards, and Yan pottery shards from the Warring States period. This site is not only large in area but also complex in age. According to the overlapping cultural layers and the different relics contained, it can be clearly divided into two different cultural layers, upper and lower. In the upper layer, there is a rectangular site similar to a foundation and two ash pits (places where ancient people stored things). Among the objects found in this layer, the complete ones include flat stone axes, pottery dou, pottery spinning wheels, pottery jars, Warring States knife coins, etc. The second layer is significantly different from the first layer. The unearthed pottery shards are all handmade products with simple shapes, low pottery quality, and all are sandy coarse pottery with plain surfaces. In this layer, there is also a circular ash pit with a diameter of more than two meters, containing ash heaps, charcoal shavings, and a small amount of bone fragments. Among the objects unearthed in the pit are complete crescent-shaped double-holed stone knives, perforated horn cones, and bone ornaments. The results of the excavation and research show that the relics unearthed in the upper layer have the characteristics of the Han and Warring States periods; the relics unearthed in the lower layer have the characteristics of the late Neolithic period. These discoveries show that our ancestors labored and lived in the border regions thousands of years ago and manufactured production tools similar to those of the Central Plains culture.

    河北滦平发现一批古代文物
    河北省文化局文物工作队在滦平县虎什哈公社十里长梁附近发现一处面积达三万平方米以上的古代遗址。掘出的文物中有辽金时代的砖瓦、磁瓦、陶杯、铜镜、玛瑙珠子，宋代铜币，汉代绳纹陶片和战国时代的燕陶片等等。这个遗址不但面积大，而且时代比较复杂。根据文化层的迭压和包含遗物的不同情况，可以清楚地分出上下两个不同的文化层。在上层有一座长方形的类似房基的遗址和两个灰坑（古人储存东西的地方）。在这层发现的器物中，完整的有扁形石斧、陶豆、陶纺轮、陶罐、战国刀币等。第二层与第一层有明显不同。出土的陶片都是属于器形简单的手制品，陶质低，全部是加沙粗陶，素面。这层内还有一处直径两米多的圆形灰坑，坑内有灰堆和满布的炭屑和少量骨块。坑内出土的器物中有完整的半月形双孔石刀、穿孔角椎和骨制装饰品等。发掘研究的结果表明：上层出土遗物具有汉代和战国时代的特征；下层出土遗物具有新石器时代晚期的特征。这些发现说明我们祖先在几千年前就曾劳动和生活在塞外地区，并且制造了与中原文化相似的生产工具。　　　　（新华社3日讯）
