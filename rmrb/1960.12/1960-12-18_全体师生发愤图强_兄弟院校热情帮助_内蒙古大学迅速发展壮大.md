Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, December 16th: Inner Mongolia University, a comprehensive university that has recently grown up in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, has achieved considerable scale in its construction in just three years under the correct leadership of the Party, the hard work and self-reliance of the school's teachers, students, and staff, and the enthusiastic help of many brotherly institutions across the country. Significant achievements have also been made in teaching, scientific research, and productive labor.

This university opened in mid-October 1957. Because the school conscientiously implemented the Party's policy of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor," and received strong support from Peking University, Nankai University, Renmin University of China, and other brotherly institutions across the country from the very beginning, the school developed rapidly. Now the school has a total of six departments and eighteen majors, with more than 1,700 students and more than 270 teachers. Six research institutes, including mathematics, mechanics, radio electronics, chemistry, botany, and Party history, and three research offices, including Mongolian history, archeology, and language, have been established in the school. In addition, there are three scientific research stations in Xilingol League Livestock Farm, Dengkou, and Baotou, as well as a preparatory class, an archive training class, and a literature and art research class. The school already has more than 350,000 books, and various instruments and equipment can basically meet the needs of current teaching and scientific research.

In terms of teaching, Inner Mongolia University has not only offered all courses in accordance with the educational plan in the short span of three years, but also made great improvements in teaching ideology, teaching content, and teaching methods, and the quality of teaching has generally improved. Many junior students have also enriched their perceptual knowledge and improved their theoretical level by participating in scientific research and actual production operations. In terms of productive labor, they have established a number of labor production bases, such as an electronic instrument factory, a chemical factory, and a comprehensive farm. The production of some of these factories has been incorporated into the national plan, and the vegetables produced in the comprehensive farm can basically meet the needs of all teachers, students, and staff, and self-sufficiency in meat will also be achieved in a short period of time. Because the policy of combining education with productive labor has been well implemented, all teachers and students have further improved and tempered their scientific theoretical level and ideological awareness while successfully completing each production labor task.

In scientific research, Inner Mongolia University has achieved great success because it has always adhered to the policy of vigorously cooperating with relevant units outside the school and facing the actual situation of the Autonomous Region. In just two and a half years, it has completed more than 870 scientific research projects. Among them, the writing and finalization of "A History of the Inner Mongolia Revolution," "A Literary History of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region," and "An Introduction to the Mongolian Language," as well as the investigation and research of the Inner Mongolia plant census, desert management, and comprehensive utilization of salt lakes and alkali lakes, are all the results of close cooperation between the school and the Inner Mongolia Normal College, the Desert Expedition Team of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and other relevant units, or with the support of relevant units. In addition to completing the common tasks of national higher education institutions, the school is also responsible for the task of prospering and developing the Mongolian national culture and science. Therefore, the development focus of each department of the school emphasizes close integration with the actual situation of various production and construction activities in the Autonomous Region. For example, the teaching of the History Department focuses on the history of northern ethnic groups with the history of Mongolia as the center. The policy of the Biology Department is mainly "facing the grasslands and touching upon the countryside."

    全体师生发愤图强  兄弟院校热情帮助
    内蒙古大学迅速发展壮大
    新华社呼和浩特16日电　内蒙古自治区新近成长起来的一所综合大学——内蒙古大学，在党的正确领导下，在学校师生员工发愤图强，自力更生和全国许多兄弟院校的热情帮助下，在短短三年中已使学校建设达到了相当规模。教学、科学研究和生产劳动，也取得了很大成绩。
    这所大学是在1957年10月中旬开学的。由于学校认真贯彻了党的“教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针，并且一开始就得到了北京大学、南开大学、中国人民大学以及全国各地一些其他兄弟院校的大力支援，使学校得到了很快的发展。现在全校共有六个系，十八个专业，学生已经达到一千七百多人，教师二百七十多人。在校内设立了数学、力学、无线电电子学、化学、植物、党史等六个研究所和蒙古史、考古、语言等三个研究室。此外，还有锡林郭勒盟种畜场、磴口、包头等三个科学研究站和一个预科班、一个档案训练班、一个文学艺术研究班。这个学校已拥有图书三十五万多册，各种仪器设备基本能适应目前教学、科学研究的需要。
    在教学方面，内蒙古大学在短短的三年中不仅按教育计划的规定开出了全部课程，而且在教学思想、教学内容、教学方法等方面都有了很大改进，教学质量普遍提高；许多初年级学生也在参加科学研究和实际生产操作中，既丰富了感性知识，也提高了理论水平。在劳动生产方面，他们已建立起一部分劳动生产基地。例如电子仪器厂、化工厂和综合农场等。其中一些工厂的生产已纳入国家计划，综合农场中生产的蔬菜已基本能满足全校师生员工的需要，肉食也争取要在短时期内做到自给。由于教育与生产劳动相结合方针贯彻得好，全校师生在出色地完成每次生产劳动任务的同时，科学理论水平和思想意识都得到了进一步的提高和锻炼。
    内蒙古大学在科学研究上，由于一直坚持与校外有关单位大搞协作和面向自治区实际的方针，取得了很大的成就。仅在两年半里，它就完成了八百七十多个科学研究项目。其中如《内蒙古革命史》、《内蒙古自治区文学史》和《蒙古语概论》的编写和定稿；内蒙古植物普查、治理沙漠、盐湖碱湖的综合利用的调查研究等，都是这个学校与内蒙古师范学院、中国科学院沙漠考查队等以及有关单位紧密协作，或在有关单位的支援下取得的。这所学校除完成全国高等学校的共同任务外，还担负着繁荣和发展蒙古民族文化科学的任务。因此，这所学校各系的发展重点都强调与自治区各项生产建设实际紧密结合。如历史系的教学是以蒙古史为中心的北方民族史为其发展重点及方向。生物系的方针主要是“面向草原，旁及农村”。
