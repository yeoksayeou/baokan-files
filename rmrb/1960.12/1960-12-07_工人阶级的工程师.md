    The Engineer of the Working Class
    Wu Lü
    "Engineer of the working class" – this is a glorious title that the workers of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company bestowed upon the company's Deputy Chief Engineer, Wang Guojun. For an engineer, this can be said to be the highest evaluation of his work.
    Why does Wang Guojun enjoy such a high reputation among the workers and receive such warm love from the masses? In the words of the workers, it is because Wang Guojun "walks the mass line well in technology."
    Taking the mass line in technology is indeed the key to determining the success or failure of an engineer's work.
    An engineer, no matter how knowledgeable or experienced, can only do his work well when he has learned the working methods of the mass line. This is because the technical knowledge and experience of any engineering and technical personnel can only solve problems in production when combined with actual production. Technical knowledge and experience that are divorced from the actual production situation here and now cannot solve many technical problems in production. The masses of workers are on the front line of production practice day and night. They are the first to come into contact with all technical problems in production, they have the deepest understanding of them, and they are best placed to conceive practical solutions to these technical problems. By taking the mass line, combining technical personnel with the masses of workers, and combining theory with practice, it is possible to effectively apply the technical knowledge and experience of technical personnel to actual production, and to theoretically summarize and improve some of the bold ideas and creations of the masses of workers.
    These are all principles that are not difficult to understand. However, some engineering and technical personnel burdened with technical baggage often find it difficult to accept this principle. They always specialize technical work, as if all work must follow the mass line, but only technical work is an exception and can only follow the route of relying on a small number of engineering and technical personnel. For these comrades, Wang Guojun is a very good mirror. As the Deputy Chief Engineer of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, he "could only discover problems and could not solve many problems" when he first went to the factory, just listening to reports. Once he went deeper and combined with the masses, he became very active, solving problems here and solving problems there, truly like a fish in water.
    Fish should live in water, theory should be combined with practice, and technical personnel should be combined with the masses of workers. This combination ensures the rapid resolution of technical problems in production and also ensures that engineering and technical personnel continuously receive rich nourishment from practice and from their combination with workers, so that their technical and theoretical level is constantly improved.
    The title "Engineer of the working class" is glorious. To obtain this glorious title, the key is whether engineering and technical personnel take the mass line.

    工人阶级的工程师
    吴滤
    “工人阶级的工程师”，这是太原钢铁公司的工人赠送给公司里的副总工程师王国钧的一个光荣称号。对于一个工程师说来，这可以说是对于他的工作的最高评价了。
    王国钧为什么能在工人中享有这样高的声望，得到群众这样热烈的爱戴呢？用工人的话说，是王国钧“技术上走群众路线走得好”。
    技术上走群众路线，这确实是决定一个工程师工作成败的关键。
    一个工程师，不管他的知识多么渊博，经验多么丰富，只有当他学会了群众路线的工作方法，才有可能把工作做好。因为任何工程技术人员的技术知识和技术经验，只有同生产实际相结合，才能解决生产中的问题。脱离此时此地的生产实际的技术知识和技术经验，是不能解决多少生产的技术问题的。而工人群众是朝夕处于生产实践的第一线的，一切生产上的技术问题都是他们最先接触，都是他们体会得最深，也最有条件设想出解决这些技术问题的切实的方案。走群众路线，技术人员和工人群众相结合，理论和实践相结合，就能有效地把技术人员的技术知识和技术经验适用于生产实际，把工人群众一些大胆的设想和创造从理论上加以总结和提高。
    这些，本来都是不难理解的道理。然而，有些背上了技术包袱的工程技术人员，往往不大容易接受这个道理。他们总是把技术工作特殊化，似乎一切工作都必须走群众路线，唯独技术工作是个例外，只能走依靠少数工程技术人员的路线。对于这些同志说来，王国钧是一面很好的镜子。他身为太原钢铁公司副总工程师，但下厂伊始，光听汇报，也还是“只能发现问题，不能解决多少问题”。一待深入下去，同群众结合一起，就活跃得很，一会儿解决了这里的问题，一会儿解决了那里的问题，真是如鱼得水。
    鱼儿应该生活在水里，理论应该和实践相结合，技术人员应该同工人群众相结合。这种结合，保证了生产上的技术问题迅速解决，也保证了工程技术人员不断地从实践中，从同工人的结合中得到丰富的滋养，使自己的技术理论水平不断得到提高。
    “工人阶级的工程师”的称号是光荣的，要取得这个光荣的称号，关键是工程技术人员是不是走群众路线。
