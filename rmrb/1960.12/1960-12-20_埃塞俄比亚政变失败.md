Xinhua News Agency, December 19th—According to Western news agency reports, the coup that occurred in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, on the 14th has failed. Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie I returned to the capital on the 17th.

The news said that this coup was launched by a section of the palace guard taking advantage of Haile Selassie I's visit to Brazil. After the coup occurred, the Addis Ababa radio station, controlled by the coup plotters, announced the establishment of a new government and appointed the Chief of Staff of the Ethiopian Armed Forces.

After the coup occurred, Haile Selassie I immediately returned from abroad to Asmara in the Eritrean province of Ethiopia. At the same time, armed forces supporting the emperor organized an attack on the coup plotters and captured the capital on the 16th.

The whereabouts of the coup plotters are uncertain. Some news said that some of the coup leaders were killed, some were arrested, and some escaped.

    埃塞俄比亚政变失败
    新华社19日讯　据西方通讯社报道，14日在埃塞俄比亚首都亚的斯亚贝巴发生的政变已告失败。埃塞俄比亚皇帝塞拉西一世已在17日回到首都。
    消息说，这次政变是宫廷警卫队中的一部分人乘塞拉西一世在巴西访问的时机发动的。在政变发生后，由政变分子操纵的亚的斯亚贝巴电台曾经宣布成立新政府，并且任命了埃塞俄比亚武装部队参谋长。
    政变发生后，塞拉西一世立即从国外赶回埃塞俄比亚厄立特里亚省的阿斯马拉。同时，支持皇帝的武装部队组织了对政变分子的进攻，并且在16日攻占了首都。
    政变分子的下落传说不一。有消息说，有的政变首脑被击毙，有的被逮捕，有的逃走。
