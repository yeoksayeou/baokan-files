Persist in Continuous Revolution and Change Backward Conditions
    ——The Experience of Dongzhen Commune in Carrying out the Movement of Backward Catching up with the Advanced
    Wang Jingkang, Liu Lizhi
    Since the beginning of this year, the Dongzhen Commune Party Committee of Wenxi County, Shanxi Province, has focused on the backward catching up with the advanced and the advanced leading the backward, thus launching a vigorous and solid movement of backward catching up with the advanced, which has enabled the work of all management districts (basic accounting units, same below) in the commune to leap forward a big step.
    Dongzhen Commune has mountains and rivers, water and drought, ridges and beaches, fertile plains with many people and little land, and hilly highlands with few people and much barren land. Due to different natural conditions and different work quality, the production levels of various management districts are very uneven, and the differences between advanced and backward are very obvious. Among the 31 management districts in the commune, when summarizing and ranking agricultural production levels at the end of last year, there were 10 first-class management districts, accounting for 32%; 14 second-class management districts, accounting for 46%; and 7 third-class management districts, accounting for 22%. Through a year of "compare, learn, catch up, and help" competition, the number of first-class management districts has increased from the original 10 to 24, the number of second-class management districts has decreased from the original 14 to 7, and third-class management districts have been eliminated. The commune's production has developed rapidly.
            Find the Cause of Backwardness and Dig out the Root of Backwardness
    There are many reasons for a backward area to be backward, and the reasons for each backward area to be backward are also different. To turn backwardness into advancement, we must first find out the root cause of its backwardness. The Dongzhen Commune mobilized the members and masses of various backward management districts to dig out the root of poverty and find the reasons. The results showed that the main reasons for their backwardness are as follows:
    First, some management districts that were originally more advanced in production, or were originally backward but have caught up with the advanced, have the idea of reaching the top and being satisfied with the status quo. For example, the Dongyao Management District was a production pacesetter unit in the entire commune for two consecutive years from 1958 to 1959, but this year, complacency arose among cadres and the masses, resulting in a backward situation in spring wheat field management. Furthermore, management districts such as Peicun and Guanzhuang, relying on their superior conditions of being surrounded by clear water, fertile land, and having alkaline land, reed land, and lotus land, also developed complacency in production. Last winter, during the chain competition movement, the commune formed a competition network consisting of the Guanzhuang, Peicun, and Cangdi management districts, but the cadres of Guanzhuang did not take Cangdi seriously at all. Director He Zhishen said: "Cangdi's paddy fields are not even as much as I would drop and not plant. What can they compete with me! I can surpass them by 108,000 miles just by walking!" Peicun, on the one hand, relied on its superior conditions of good land, and on the other hand, believed that it was a key management district of the commune. At the beginning of the competition, the cadres said: "Whether we compete or not, the red flag will be ours sooner or later. Even if it's not good, the leadership will have to take care of us." However, the Cangdi Management District, although located in the hills and with barren land, was full of energy and strived to be upstream. Therefore, the masses commented: "Peicun relies on being a key area, Guanzhuang relies on conditions, and Cangdi relies on hard work." In the three evaluations of wheat field management and spring sowing this year, Cangdi was rated as upstream, Peicun as average, and Guanzhuang as the worst.
    Second, in some backward management districts that have not caught up, they believe that they are inferior to others in everything, and have developed a discouraged and pessimistic mood. For example, the cadres of Yukou Management District said: "You catch up with advanced districts, but the advanced districts are not sleeping either! You advance, and they advance too, and you will never catch up!" Some management districts are also backward because commune cadres visit less often, provide less specific guidance, and give more criticism and less encouragement, which hurts the confidence of the masses.
    Third, some management districts have not found the fundamental problem of changing backward production, that is, they have not accurately and ruthlessly grasped the main contradictions in the development of things, and are satisfied with general appeals without taking effective measures to address the problems.
    Fourth, some management districts are not serious, earnest, or resolute in implementing the Party's policies, so that they cannot fully mobilize the production enthusiasm of the masses, resulting in a backward state of production.
          Establish the Ambition to Catch up with the Advanced and Offer Plans to Catch up with the Advanced
    Many experiences have repeatedly told us that backwardness is not terrible, but what is terrible is the psychological state of being content with backwardness. As long as we dare to admit backwardness, face up to backwardness, find out the reasons, and dig out the roots, we will generate endless power and encourage the backward to catch up with or surpass the advanced.
    After the launch of the movement of backward catching up with the advanced in Dongzhen Commune, the masses and cadres generally had two erroneous understandings in their thinking. One was that they did not sufficiently recognize the arduousness and complexity of changing the face of backwardness, and regarded it as an easy task that could be "accomplished overnight," thus relaxing the fighting spirit of the masses, and when difficulties came, they showed disappointment or even became discouraged. Another tendency was to believe that the advanced were unattainable, lacking ambition, exaggerating the degree of difficulty, not seeing their own favorable conditions, and not daring to find advanced districts as competitors. In order to overcome the above-mentioned two erroneous understandings among the masses, the commune Party committee, on the one hand, pointed out the arduousness of the backward catching up with the advanced, and on the other hand, criticized the attitude of looking at problems with old eyes. It also emphasized that backwardness can be changed and that the advanced can be surpassed. As long as we have lofty ambitions and soaring energy, everyone can become an advanced person. From then on, everyone's confidence was sufficient. Feng Degao, secretary of the Dongyu Management District branch, said: "Advancement is not innate, and backwardness is not inherited. As long as everyone is of one mind, backwardness will definitely catch up with advancement." Bai Tianfu, an 80-year-old man from Dongyu Management District, said: "We do the same work as others and plant the same land. Why are we always lagging behind, suffering losses, and receiving supplies?" After attending the mobilization meeting in the entire district, he convened a family meeting and decided to contribute to changing backwardness. On the basis of the enthusiastic and high-spirited masses, the commune Party committee steered the boat with the wind, guided the situation, found opponents for the backward areas, established opposites, and organized a competition movement of "compare, learn, catch up, and help."
    It is also impossible to achieve the effect of catching up with the advanced if one only has the ambition to catch up with the advanced but lacks good strategies to catch up with the advanced. Therefore, after the masses were initially mobilized, the commune Party committee launched a movement to offer suggestions and plans for backward catching up with the advanced among the cadres and masses of all backward areas. After full mobilization and extensive consultation, all localities found fundamental measures to completely change the backward face of production.
              Focus on a Little Red in Backward Areas
    The backwardness of a unit or a region is by no means all dark and without any merit. There will always be positive factors and relatively advanced parts in it. A true Marxist must cherish even the slightest positive factors in backward areas, seize them firmly, publicize them greatly, and encourage them greatly, in order to achieve the effect of moving one and driving a hundred, from a little red to many reds, and finally achieve overall red and complete red. In leading the movement of backward catching up with the advanced, the Dongzhen Commune Party Committee firmly grasped this point. For example, the Caishe Management District, everyone said it was backward, was often criticized, and was always downstream in the evaluation, with insufficient confidence among cadres and low morale among the masses. At the beginning of this spring's backward catching up with the advanced competition, the management district cadres said: "Whether we catch up or not, we are not good. We are already a well-known 'old snail'. The rat's tail has not changed its momentum, and it will always be these two things." After learning about this situation, Dong Wanxin, secretary of the commune Party committee, was very considerate of their feelings, so he tried to find positive factors and establish their self-esteem and self-confidence. Although production here is backward, the public canteen is a pacesetter in the province and has won the red flag. They seized this point, publicized it everywhere, praised it greatly, and encouraged the masses everywhere, and organized other management districts to visit and learn here. This boosted the morale of the masses, and their enthusiasm increased. Deputy Director Pei Tiankai said: "Our village is still valued by the leaders. In the future, we must work hard and strive to be upstream, strive to be first in all aspects of work, and resolutely get rid of the backward label." The members saw that others came to their area to visit, and they worked harder and harder. After that, they finally changed their backward face and caught up with the advanced. The cadres of the Jiajiayu Management District also often felt that their conditions were not as good as others, and they were not very motivated, and agricultural production was backward for a long time. The commune Party committee mobilized the masses to dig out positive factors and find favorable conditions. As a result, they found four major favorable conditions compared to the best Donglu District in the entire commune: more land, better land, sufficient water sources, and sufficient fertilizer. This made the masses generally reflect that "their minds are clear, their eyes are bright, their confidence is sufficient, and their energy is greater." Secretary Feng Debo said: "In the past, it was not that the conditions were not good, but that the energy was insufficient."
            Grasp the Fundamental Measures for Developing Production
    There are many reasons why a backward area is backward, but there is always one main reason that plays a decisive role. For example, in Baicun, Dongzhen, and Xiazhai districts, according to the natural conditions here, the key to changing the backward face of production lies in controlling soil erosion. The Dongzhen Management District is located at the mouth of the Jiulonggou. Every year during the rainy season, the nine major floods that come down from the Emei Mountains converge in the Dongzhen Management District, flushing stones and silt, damaging good fields. Of the 7,000 mu of land in the entire district, more than 1,000 mu were silted up by 1959. After the commune Party committee helped them grasp this key issue, the management district organized a soil and water conservation professional team of more than 1,200 people to carry out large-scale soil and water conservation in the upstream Sanjiao, Ganqing, and other gullies. The upstream management district also carried out management in coordination with fraternal management districts in accordance with the principle of comprehensive management. After more than a year of efforts, all soil erosion has been controlled. No major floods have occurred during the flood season last year and this year, achieving the goal of no water going down the mountain and no soil leaving the ditch, thereby increasing the grain yield of Dongzhen Management District from 128 jin per mu in 1957 to 245 jin this year. The key to developing production in Yukou, Caishe, and other management districts is to change saline-alkali land. These areas are all located near the Shili Alkaline Beach. In addition, the water level has risen over the years, and the land has become alkaline year by year. In the wheat and autumn seasons, not to mention high yields, even small seedlings cannot be captured. During the competition movement, the commune Party committee helped them make up their minds to completely change the saline-alkali land. More than 60 water wells with excessive alkalinity were replaced with river water for irrigation. In areas where there were no conditions to divert river water, large drainage ditches were built. Now, 3,500 mu of severely alkalized land in these five management districts have all been transformed, laying the foundation for increasing grain production.
          Vigorously Publicize Policies and Resolutely Implement Policies
    Learning policies, publicizing policies, implementing policies, and executing policies, so that policies meet the masses and that policies are thoroughly realized, is a fundamental measure taken by the Dongzhen Commune Party Committee from beginning to end in the movement of backward catching up with the advanced. Policy is the lifeblood of the Party. Where policies are well implemented, the production enthusiasm of the masses is high and production is advanced; where policies are not well implemented, the production enthusiasm of the masses is low and production is backward. The main reason for the backwardness of some management districts in Dongzhen Commune is precisely due to the failure to earnestly implement policies. For example, in the Liyuan Management District, the "three guarantees and one reward" system was just revised this spring, and the production teams were working hard. In order to make a breakthrough in high yield, the management district transferred labor from various teams, disrupting the normal production order of the teams, resulting in some production teams not completing the spring plowing tasks according to the production plan. The masses commented: "There is no hope for overproduction this time, and no hope for rewards." This caused production to fall behind for a while. Later, with the help of Comrade Gu Zigang, secretary of the commune Party committee, the previous erroneous practices were checked and corrected based on the opinions of the masses, and the four fixings of labor, animal power, land, and farm tools were implemented, so the production enthusiasm of the masses increased and their morale increased, and they changed the backward state of production in one fell swoop. The Chuankou Management District is composed of four villages: Dalozhuang, Xiaolozhuang, Chuankou, and Zhangjiazhuang. Last year, although Dalozhuang and Xiaolozhuang planted dry land, due to the great enthusiasm of the members, both teams overproduced and should be rewarded; Chuankou was a flat-yield team, and Zhangjiazhuang was a reduced-yield team and should compensate for the reduction. However, due to the localism of the management district cadres, the director and accountant, who were the main cadres, were all from Zhangjiazhuang. During the autumn settlement and distribution, they overturned the original "three guarantees and one reward" system and made the excuse: "This year, the drought is serious, a special situation, and all calculations are based on the number of workdays invested." The members of the Dalozhuang and Xiaolozhuang teams had great opinions, so the enthusiasm of the masses was not high when contracting production this year. After the commune discovered this problem, it dealt with the cadres who had committed localism errors, and the three guarantee plans were fully implemented, with rewards for those who should be rewarded and compensation for those who should be compensated, and the morale of the masses was greatly boosted, and the production outlook was completely renewed. The broad masses compared our policies to "railways," the tasks to "trains," and the cadres to "drivers." If the cadres do not implement the policies, the train will be derailed, and it will be difficult to move an inch. Therefore, in the movement of backward catching up with the advanced, the commune Party committee attached special importance to improving the work style of cadres.
            Commune Support and Advanced Area Assistance
    While the masses in the backward areas are striving for self-improvement, working hard, and striving to catch up with the advanced, the commune also provides them with strong support in all aspects. Over the past year, the commune has provided backward areas with machinery, cash, etc., totaling more than 45,000 yuan, and has drawn 13 strong cadres to take leadership positions in backward areas to strengthen leadership. In addition, the Party and League organization construction has been strengthened in backward areas, and the cadre team has been rectified.
    While vigorously supporting backward areas, the commune also mobilized advanced areas to actively help backward areas. For example, when Xiabaicun was catching up with Ganqing, Zhao Anji, a soil and water conservation expert from Ganqing, carried dry food on his back to Baicun to plan and implement, which deeply moved the cadres and members of Baicun, and they became more confident in catching up with the advanced. In September, the commune also organized an acceptance and promotion team for the movement of backward catching up with the advanced. In addition to the four secretaries of the commune participating, there were also 15 experts from various fields, such as soil and water conservation expert Zhao Anji, five-skill cook Jing Yulan, and cotton planting expert Wu Jichang. Every time they went to a backward area, they would impart technology and experience according to the principle of supplementing what was lacking. This played a great role in promoting the backward to catch up with the advanced, both technically and spiritually.
          Open the Flowers of Catching up with the Advanced and Reap the Fruits of Catching up with the Advanced
    More than a year of the movement of backward catching up with the advanced has greatly changed the production outlook of Dongzhen Commune. For example, the well-known backward area, Guanzhuang Management District, was inspired by the slogan of "make up for summer losses in autumn, and make up for wheat field losses in autumn fields." After three months of fierce fighting, it achieved one mu of guaranteed irrigation per person, overcame the once-in-a-century drought, and won a bumper autumn harvest, making up for the losses suffered from the summer production reduction. The total output of wheat in the originally backward Caishe Management District decreased compared to last year, but the autumn output increased compared to last year. All of the original 12 backward management districts in the entire commune have changed their faces.
                  ×　　　　　×　　　　　×
    The development of objective things will always have relatively advanced and relatively backward aspects at any time, and will never be uniform. This is the law of the development of things. Practice has proved that when old contradictions are resolved, new contradictions will arise. This requires us to advance triumphantly on the basis of victory with the spirit of continuous revolution, leap again and again, set new goals, organize new competitions, in order to achieve new achievements.

    坚持不断革命　改变落后状况
    ——东镇公社开展落后赶先进运动的经验
    王景康　刘立志
    今年以来，中共山西闻喜县东镇公社党委大抓落后赶先进，大抓先进带落后，从而掀起了一个既轰轰烈烈又扎扎实实的落后赶先进运动，使全社各个管理区（基本核算单位，下同）的工作都向前跃进了一大步。
    东镇公社有山有川，有水有旱，有岭有滩，有人多地少土地肥沃的平川地带，有人少地多土地瘠薄的丘陵高垣。由于自然条件不同，由于工作好坏不同，各个管理区的生产水平很不平衡，先进与落后的差异十分明显。全社共三十一个管理区，在去年年终根据农业生产水平总结排队时，一类管理区有十个，占32％；二类管理区有十四个，占46％；三类管理区有七个，占22％。经过一年来的“比、学、赶、帮”竞赛运动，现在一类管理区已由原来的十个增为二十四个，二类管理区已由原来的十四个下降为七个，三类管理区已经消灭。全社生产迅速发展。
            找落后之因　挖落后之根
    一个落后区之所以落后的原因是多方面的，各个落后区之所以落后的原因也是互不相同的。要使落后变先进，必先找出其落后的根源。东镇公社发动各个落后管理区的社员群众挖穷根、找原因的结果，弄清它们之所以落后的原因主要有以下几个方面：
    第一，一部分原来生产比较先进的管理区，或者是原来落后但已经赶上先进的管理区，有跃进到顶与满足现状思想。如东姚管理区，1958年至1959年，连续两年都是全社的生产标兵单位，但因今年在干部和群众中产生了自满情绪，便造成了今春麦田管理工作的落后状况。再如，裴村、官庄等管理区，凭着自己有清水环绕，土地肥沃，碱地、苇地、莲地样样俱全的优越条件，也在生产上产生了自满情绪。去年冬天开展连环竞赛运动中，公社把官庄、裴村、仓底三个管理区组成了一个竞赛网，而官庄的干部根本不把仓底放在眼里，主任何志申说：“仓底的水地还没有我掉下不种的多哩，他凭啥和我竞赛！我提上鞋带子走，也能超过他十万八千里。”裴村一面凭着自己有好地的优越条件，一面认为他是公社的重点管理区，竞赛一开始，干部们就说：“赛不赛，红旗早晚是咱的。再不好，领导也得照顾照顾。”而仓底管理区，虽然地处丘陵，土地瘠薄，可是他们干劲充沛，力争上游。所以，群众议论道：“裴村凭的是重点，官庄凭的是条件，仓底凭的是实干。”在今年的麦田管理、春耕播种三次评比中，仓底被评为上游，裴村一般，官庄最差。
    第二，在一些没有赶上的落后管理区，认为自己一切不如人，产生了泄气与悲观情绪。如峪口管理区的干部说：“你赶先进区，人家先进区也没有睡觉呀！你前进，人家也前进，一辈子也赶不上！”也有些管理区由于公社干部去得少，具体指导少，批评多，鼓励少，伤害了群众的自信心。这也是造成一部分地区落后的原因。
    第三，有些管理区对改变生产落后的根本问题没有找到，也就是对于事物发展中的主要矛盾抓得不准、不狠，满足于一般号召，而没有针对问题采取有效的措施。
    第四，有些管理区在执行党的政策上不严肃、不认真、不坚决，以致不能充分调动群众的生产积极性，造成了生产上的落后状态。
          立赶先进之志　献赶先进之策
    许多经验一再告诉我们，落后并不可怕，可怕的是安于落后的心理状态。只要敢于承认落后，正视落后，找出原因，挖出根子，就会产生无穷无尽的力量，鼓励后进赶上或超过先进。
    东镇公社的落后赶先进运动掀起之后，群众和干部思想上较普遍的产生了两种错误认识。一种对改变落后面貌的艰巨复杂性认识不足，把它当作一件轻而易举的事情，认为可以“一蹴而就”，因而松懈了群众的斗志，及至困难来临，又表现失望，或者一蹶不振。另一种倾向，是认为先进高不可攀，缺乏雄心壮志，夸大困难程度，看不见自身的有利条件，不敢找先进区作为竞赛对手。公社党委为了克服群众中存在的上述两种错误认识，一方面指出落后赶先进的艰巨性，一方面批判了用老眼光看问题的态度。并强调指出，落后是可以改变的，先进是可以超过的。只要有雄心大志，有冲天干劲，人人都可以成为先进者。从此，大家的信心充足了。东峪管理区支书冯德高说：“先进不是天生的，落后也非娘养的。只要大家一条心，落后定能赶先进。”东峪管理区八十老翁白天富说：“咱们和人家干的一行活，种的一样地，为什么年年落人亏歉，受人供应呢？”在参加了全区动员大会之后，他召集了家庭会议，决心为改变落后出力。公社党委在群情振奋，斗志昂扬的基础上，顺风掌舵，因势利导，给落后区找到了对手，树立了对立面，组织了“比学赶帮”的竞赛运动。
    光有赶先进的壮志，而无赶先进的良策，亦不能收到赶先进之效。于是公社党委在群众初步发动起来之后，又在所有的后进区的干部、群众中发动了一个落后赶先进的献计献策运动。经过充分发动，广泛征询意见，各地都找出了彻底改变生产落后面貌的根本措施。
              在落后地区大抓一点红
    一个单位一个地区的落后，决不是漆黑一团，一无是处，在它里面总会有积极因素，总会有比较先进的部分。一个真正的马克思主义者，必须十分珍惜落后地区的哪怕只有一点点的积极因素，并狠狠抓住它，大加宣扬，大鼓干劲，才会收到推一动百之效，由一点红到点点红，最后达到全面红、满堂红。东镇公社党委在领导落后赶先进的运动中，就紧紧掌握了这一点。如蔡薛管理区，人人都说它落后，常常挨批评，评比台上老是下游，干部信心不足，群众情绪不高。今春落后赶先进竞赛运动开始时，管理区干部就说：“赶不赶，咱是不行，咱这已经是出了名的‘老蜗牛’，老鼠尾巴没变势，终究是这两下了。”公社党委书记董万馨同志了解到这个情况后，对他们这种心情十分体贴，于是想办法抓积极因素，树立他们的自尊心与自信心。这里生产虽然落后，但公共食堂是全省的标兵，得过红旗。他们就抓住了这一点，到处宣传，大加表扬，处处给群众鼓气，并组织其它管理区到这里参观学习。这一下，群众的劲头起来了，情绪高涨了，副主任裴天开说：“咱这村子，领导上还能看得起，今后要实干苦干争上游，全面工作都争先，坚决甩掉落后帽子。”社员们看到别人到自己区来参观，也越干越有劲。此后，终于改变了落后面貌，赶上了先进。吉家峪管理区的干部，也常常感到自己的条件不如人，劲头不大，农业生产长期落后。公社党委就发动群众挖积极因素，找有利条件。结果找出了比全公社最好的东鲁区有地多、地好、水源足、肥料足的四大有利条件。这一下，群众普遍反映“头脑清醒了，眼睛明亮了，信心足了，干劲大了。”支书冯德博说：“过去不是条件不好，而是干劲不足。”
            抓发展生产的根本性措施
    落后区之所以落后，其原因固然是多方面的，但其中总有一个主要的起着决定性作用的原因。如白村、东镇、下寨等区，根据这里的自然条件，要改变生产上的落后面貌，关键就在于控制水土流失。东镇管理区位于九龙沟口，每年雨季从峨嵋岭上下来的九道大水，集中于东镇管理区，冲石淤沙，损坏了良田。全区共七千亩土地，到1959年就淤沙一千多亩。公社党委帮助他们抓住这一关键性的问题之后，管理区组织了一千二百多人的水保专业队，在上游的三交、干庆等沟内大搞水土保持。上游管理区也根据全面治理的方针，配合兄弟管理区进行了治理。经过一年多以来的努力，全部控制了水土流失，去年和今年汛期，从未发生大水，作到了水不下山、土不出沟，从而使东镇管理区的粮食产量由1957年的亩产一百二十八斤提高到今年的二百四十五斤。峪口、蔡薛等管理区，发展生产的关键问题是改变盐碱地。这些地区均位于十里碱滩的附近，加之历年水位上升，土地逐年碱化，麦秋两季别说丰产，连小苗都捉不住。竞赛运动中，公社党委帮助他们下定决心，彻底改变盐碱地，对六十多眼碱质过重的水井，改用河水浇地，没有引河水条件的地区，大搞排水渠。现在，这五个管理区的三千五百亩严重碱化地，全部得到了改造，为增产粮食打下基础。
          大力宣传政策　坚决贯彻政策
    学习政策，宣传政策，贯彻政策，执行政策，使政策和群众见面，使政策彻底实现，这是东镇公社党委在大抓落后赶先进运动中自始至终所采取的一项根本措施。政策是党的生命，哪里政策执行得好，群众的生产情绪就高，生产就先进；哪里政策执行得不好，群众的生产情绪就低，生产就落后。东镇公社有一部分管理区落后的主要原因，正是由于不认真执行政策造成的。如礼元管理区，今春刚刚修订了“三包一奖”制度，各生产队正干的起劲，管理区为了突击丰产方，从各队抽调劳力，打乱了各队正常的生产秩序，结果使有些生产小队没有按照生产计划完成春耕任务。群众议论道：“这一下超产没指望啦，奖励没希望啦。”造成生产一度落后。后来在公社党委书记谷子刚同志的帮助下，根据群众意见，检查纠正了以前的错误作法，实行劳力、畜力、土地、农具四固定，因而群众的生产劲头大了，情绪高了，一举改变了生产上的落后状态。川口管理区是由大罗庄、小罗庄、川口、张家庄四个村组成的，去年大、小罗庄种的虽系旱地，但由于社员干劲大，两个队都超产了，应当受奖；川口是个平产队，张家庄是个减产队，应当赔产，但由于管理区的干部有本位主义，主任、会计几个主要干部都是张家庄的，在秋后决算分配时，他们推翻了原来制订的“三包一奖”制度，并借口说：“今年旱灾严重，特殊情况，一律按投工数计算。”大、小罗庄两个队的社员意见很大，所以在今年搞包产时群众积极性不高。公社发觉这个问题后，对犯有本位主义错误的干部作了处理，三包方案全部兑现，该奖的奖，该赔的赔，群众情绪为之大振，生产面貌为之一新。广大群众把我们的政策比喻为“铁轨”，把任务比为“列车”，把干部比为“司机”，如果干部不执行政策，列车出了轨，就将寸步难移。所以，在落后赶先进运动中，公社党委对于改进干部作风问题特别重视。
            公社的扶植和先进区的帮助
    在落后区群众发愤图强，艰苦奋斗，力赶先进的同时，公社也从各方面对他们以大力支持。一年来公社对落后区支援的机械、现金等共折款四万五千多元，并抽出十三个坚强的干部到落后区担任了领导职务，加强了领导。此外，还在落后区加强了党、团组织建设，整顿了干部队伍。
    公社在大力扶植落后区的同时，也发动先进区积极帮助落后区。例如下白村在赶干庆的时候，干庆的水土保持专家赵安吉就背上干粮到白村边规划、边实干，使白村的干部、社员深受感动，他们赶先进的信心更足了。9月份公社还组织了一个落后赶先进运动验收促进团，除公社的四个书记全部参加外，还有水土保持专家赵安吉、五巧炊事员荆玉兰、植棉能手吴吉昌等各个方面的能手十五人参加，他们每到一个落后区，都根据缺啥补啥的原则，传授技术和经验。这对于帮助落后赶先进，在技术上和精神上也起了极大的促进作用。
          开赶先进之花　结赶先进之果
    一年多的落后赶先进运动，大大改变了东镇公社的生产面貌。如有名的落后区官庄管理区，在“夏季丢了秋季补，麦田丢了秋田补”的口号鼓舞下，激战三个月，达到了一人一亩保浇田，战胜了百年未遇的大干旱，夺取了秋季大丰收，补起了夏季减产所受的损失。原来落后的蔡薛管理区的小麦总产比去年减少，而秋产却比去年增长。全公社原来的十二个落后管理区，全部改变了面貌。
                  ×　　　　　×　　　　　×
    客观事物的发展，到什么时候也总会有比较先进和比较落后的，绝不会是整齐划一，这是事物发展的规律。实践证明，旧的矛盾解决了，新的矛盾又会产生。这就要求我们必须以不断革命的精神，在胜利的基础上，乘胜猛进，一跃再跃，树立新的目标，组织新的竞赛，以期达到新的成就。
