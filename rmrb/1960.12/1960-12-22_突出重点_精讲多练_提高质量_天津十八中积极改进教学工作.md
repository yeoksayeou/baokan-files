Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 21st: The Party branch of Tianjin No. 18 Middle School actively leads and helps teachers improve teaching, reduce the burden on teachers and students, and ensure that they have both work and rest.

The teachers and students of this school have shown great enthusiasm for work and study in the process of teaching reform. In order to consolidate this enthusiasm and allow teachers and students to combine work and rest, the Party branch decided to further help teachers improve teaching. The Party branch proposed that key points should be highlighted in major courses, instruction should be concise, and practice should be extensive. There should be lectures, practice, review, consolidation, demonstrations, and necessary experiments in the classroom, and one-third of the time should be set aside for tutoring students with their homework and answering difficult questions on the spot, so that students can understand and consolidate the content of the new courses in class. The result of this is that it can reduce students' after-school review time and also reduce the amount of after-school tutoring and homework grading for teachers.

To this end, the Party branch secretary, committee members, and others went deep into the teaching and research groups to explore experience. After listening to lectures from some teachers in each subject and the analysis of teaching methods by each teaching and research group, Vice Principal Gan Ning found that the teaching methods of teachers in the physics group and the foreign language group were relatively good and could meet the above requirements. He decided that the teaching affairs office should help these two teaching and research groups summarize their experience and promote it throughout the school. The Party branch called on Party members to take the lead in creating new teaching experiences together with the teachers. Zhuang Wenying, deputy leader of the Chinese language group and a Party member, organized Chinese language teachers to repeatedly discuss the importance of the teaching method of concise instruction and extensive practice, and invited veteran teacher Ning Hengran to give demonstration teaching for everyone, which greatly improved everyone's teaching methods. The Party branch also organized observational teaching between groups and individuals, signed teacher-apprentice contracts, promoted the combination of teachers with more experience and teachers with less experience, learned from each other's strengths and made up for each other's weaknesses, thereby improving teaching quality.

The school's Party branch also vigorously streamlined meetings, so that each teacher's time spent attending various meetings and collective lesson preparation does not exceed two to four hours per week. At the same time, it solved the problem of teachers holding too many concurrent posts, insisting on one person, one job, so that they could concentrate on teaching well.

After these efforts, not only has the school's teaching quality improved, but also the rest of teachers and students has been fully guaranteed.

    突出重点  精讲多练  提高质量
    天津十八中积极改进教学工作
    新华社天津21日电　天津市第十八中学党支部积极领导和帮助教师改进教学，减轻师生负担，做到有劳有逸。
    这个学校的师生在教学改革过程中，工作和学习的热情很高。为了巩固这种热情，并使师生劳逸结合，党支部决定进一步帮助教师改进教学。党支部提出在主要课程上要作到重点突出，精讲多练，课堂上有讲、有练、有复习、有巩固，有演示与必要的实验，并且留出三分之一的时间当堂辅导学生作业、解答疑难问题，使学生能当堂理解和巩固新课程的内容。这样做的结果，可以减少学生课后复习时间，也减轻教师课外辅导和批改作业的分量。
    党支部书记、委员等为此深入到各教研组去摸索经验。副校长甘宁在听了各学科一部分教师的讲课和各教研组对教学方法的分析以后，发现物理组和外语组教师的教学方法比较好，能达到上述的要求，就决定由教导处帮助这两个教研组总结经验，在全校推广。党支部号召党员带头同教师们一起创造新的教学经验。语文组副组长、党员庄文英，组织语文教师反复讨论了精讲多练的教学方法的重要性，并且请老教师宁衡然为大家作示范教学，使大家的教学方法有了很大改进。党支部还在组与组、人与人之间组织观摩教学，签订师徒合同，促进经验多的教师和经验少的教师结合，互相取长补短，从而提高了教学质量。
    学校党支部还大力精简会议，使每个教师每周参加各种会议和集体备课的时间不超过二至四小时。同时，解决教师兼职过多的问题，坚持一人一职，使他们能集中精力教学得好。
    经过这些努力以后，学校不仅教学质量提高；并且使师生们的休息得到了充分的保证。
