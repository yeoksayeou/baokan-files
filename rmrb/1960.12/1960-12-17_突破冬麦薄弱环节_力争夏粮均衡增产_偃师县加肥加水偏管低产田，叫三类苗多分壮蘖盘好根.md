Our Zhengzhou dispatch on the 15th: In wheat field management, Yanshi County, Henan Province, continues to adhere to the principles of grasping balanced production and addressing weak links. While not relaxing management of high-yield plots and first- and second-class wheat fields, the county concentrates superior forces to carry out the "Five Catch-ups" (late planting catching up with early planting, replanting catching up with light planting, distant land catching up with nearby land, sloping land catching up with flat land, poor land catching up with fertile land), "Two Transformations" (transforming third-class seedlings into first-class seedlings, transforming low-yield fields into high-yield fields), and "One Exceed" (actual output exceeding contracted output) campaign. They are focusing on the management of general fields and third-class seedlings, laying a more solid foundation for large-scale balanced production in the coming summer.

Yanshi County is a major winter wheat producing area in Henan Province. After communization, production brigades vigorously developed high-yield wheat plots and conscientiously implemented the "Eight-Character Charter for Agriculture," accumulating relatively systematic experience in increasing production. This year, when planting wheat, they fully utilized this experience and made all preparations early, while also universally focusing on balanced production and addressing weak links. As a result, the vast majority of wheat seedlings emerged more evenly and grew more vigorously than in previous years. However, due to the later clearing of over 112,000 mu of wheat fields or heavy previous crops, over 30,000 mu of intercropped fields, and over 9,000 mu of dry land or emergency planting with insufficient base fertilizer or even no base fertilizer, there are still a certain number of third-class seedlings in the county's wheat fields. These third-class seedlings are not only found in general fields and relatively remote areas, but also exist in some high-yield plots. If they are not strengthened through management before winter, to turn weakness into strength, it will not only affect continued tillering, but also lead to death due to low cold resistance. The Yanshi County Party Committee believes that this is a weak link in striving for a bumper harvest next summer. Therefore, it called on the entire county to concentrate superior forces (that is, putting fertilizer first, prioritizing fertilizer, water, and management), while not relaxing management of high-yield plots and first- and second-class wheat seedlings, to immediately launch the "Five Catch-ups, Two Transformations, and One Exceed" campaign, so that all third-class seedlings can develop more strong tillers and stronger roots before winter.

Vigorously grasping ideological education, vigorously grasping policy implementation, and vigorously grasping the mass line are effective measures taken by the Yanshi County Party Committee to mobilize the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses, quickly launch this campaign, break through weak links, and ensure balanced production. This year, the quality of wheat sowing in Yanshi County is higher than in previous years, and wheat seedling growth is better than in previous years. Therefore, a considerable number of the masses and cadres have developed a kind of blind optimism. In order to improve the ideological understanding of cadres and commune members, the county, commune Party committees, and brigade Party branches, on the one hand, organized cadres, experienced farmers, and technicians to go deep into the fields to universally check wheat seedling growth, using the fact that there were both good and bad areas to eliminate this thinking; on the other hand, they mobilized the masses to sum up past experiences of increasing production due to early management and prioritized management, and lessons of low production due to late and poor management, universally improving the ideological understanding of the vast number of commune members. On the basis of widespread improvement in the ideological understanding of the vast number of cadres and commune members, all 187 production brigades (basic accounting units) in the county's seven communes, through the formulation of annual distribution plans, universally checked the implementation of the "three guarantees and one reward" system for each contracted production team in the summer and autumn seasons, and further revised and implemented the recent "three guarantees and one reward" for wheat fields. Li Village Commune, located in a hilly area, planted more than 4,000 mu of wheat this year, of which 860 mu were third-class. In order to strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest next year, the brigade, after fully implementing summer and autumn production, fully realizing the "three guarantees and one reward", and summing up the experience of rewards and compensation, stipulated the contracted output targets and reward methods for various types of wheat fields, with the consent of the masses, based on the current wheat seedling growth and management requirements. This has greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the masses to prioritize the management of third-class wheat fields and distant, lean wheat fields. Each of the brigade's seven production teams extracted 50% of their labor force and seven fertilizer application and irrigation technicians, and concentrated many manure transporting and watering tools to carry out the fertilizer application and watering campaign, prioritizing third-class seedlings first, then second-class seedlings, and then first-class seedlings; prioritizing distant, sloping, and lean land first, and then nearby, flat, and fertile land.

In carrying out the "Five Catch-ups, Two Transformations, and One Exceed" campaign, Party committees at all levels in the county strengthened leadership over weak links. As early as the beginning of wheat sowing, the county Party committee increased personnel and strengthened leadership on the front line of production. Recently, led by Zhang Mingwu, the first secretary of the county Party committee, more than 40 cadres with high policy levels were organized to, on the one hand, check the implementation of policies and the mass line in various places, and on the other hand, help analyze and timely solve new situations and new problems in the wheat field management campaign. This has created a better situation in the current wheat field management.

After the "Five Catch-ups, Two Transformations, and One Exceed" campaign, centered on realizing over-contracted production plans, was gradually launched in various communes and brigades, it not only enabled third-class wheat fields to receive early and prioritized management, but also promoted further improvement of first- and second-class wheat fields. At present, more than 23,000 mu in the county have been top-dressed once, more than 21,000 mu have been watered once, more than 2,200 mu have been loosened and moisture-preserved, and more than 5,700 mu have been treated for pest and disease control.

    突破冬麦薄弱环节　力争夏粮均衡增产
    偃师县加肥加水偏管低产田，叫三类苗多分壮蘖盘好根
    本报郑州15日电　河南省偃师县在麦田管理中，继续坚持抓平衡增产、抓薄弱环节，在不放松丰产方和一、二类麦田管理的同时，集中优势力量，开展“五赶”（晚茬赶早茬、重茬赶轻茬、远地赶近地、坡地赶平地、瘦地赶肥地）“二变”（变三类苗为一类苗、变低产田为高产田）“一超”（实产超包产）运动，偏管一般田和三类苗，为明年夏季大面积均衡增产奠定了更扎实的基础。
    偃师县是河南省冬小麦的主要产区。公社化后，以小队为单位大搞小麦丰产方，认真贯彻执行“农业八字宪法”，积累了比较系统的增产经验。今年种麦时，充分运用了这些经验，及早作好一切准备工作，同时又普遍做好了抓平衡增产、抓薄弱环节，因此绝大部分麦苗比往年出得整齐，长得茁壮。但是由于有十一万二千多亩麦田腾茬较晚或前茬较重，三万多亩麦田是间作套种，九千多亩是旱地或是抢墒下种、底肥不足甚至未施底肥，因此全县麦田中仍有一定数量是三类苗。这些三类苗不只是一般田和比较偏远的地里有，连丰产方里也有点片的存在。越冬前若不通过加强管理，使它转弱为强，不仅影响继续盘头发杈，而且将因抗寒能力小而死亡。中共偃师县委认为，这是争取明年夏季丰收的薄弱环节。因此号召全县在不放松丰产方和一、二类麦苗管理的同时，集中优势力量（也就是肥字挂帅、偏肥、偏水、偏管理），立即开展“五赶、二变、一超”运动，使所有三类苗在越冬前多分壮蘖、盘好根。
    大抓思想教育，大抓政策执行，大抓群众路线，是中共偃师县委调动广大干部、群众积极性，迅速掀起这一运动，突破薄弱环节，确保平衡增产的有效措施。今年偃师县播麦质量比往年高，麦苗生长比往年好。因此，有相当一部分群众和干部出现一种盲目乐观情绪。为了提高干部和社员的思想认识，县、社党委和大队支部，一方面组织干部、老农、技术员深入田间，普遍检查麦苗生长情况，用大面积有好有坏的事实，消除这种思想；一方面发动群众总结过去早管、偏管因而增产的经验，管得晚、管得差因而低产的教训，普遍提高了广大社员的思想认识。在广大干部、群众思想认识有了普遍提高的基础上，全县七个公社的一百八十七个大队（基本核算单位），通过制订全年分配方案，普遍检查夏、秋两季各包产生产队“三包一奖”制的执行情况，进一步修订和落实了最近麦田的“三包一奖”。地处丘陵地区的李村公社油赵大队，今年种了四千多亩麦，其中三类的达八百六十多亩。大队为了争取明年全面丰产，在夏秋产量完全落实，三包一奖全部兑现，并总结了奖赔的经验以后，根据当前麦苗生长情况和管理要求，经过群众同意，规定了各类麦田的包产指标和奖励办法。这样，就大大激发群众偏管三类麦田和远地、瘦地麦田的积极性。全大队七个生产队各抽出50％的劳力和七名追肥、浇水技术员，集中很多运粪和浇水工具，开展了以先三类苗、后二类苗、再一类苗；先远地、坡地、瘦地，再近地、平地、肥地的追肥、浇水运动。
    在开展“五赶、二变、一超”运动中，全县各级党委都加强对薄弱环节的领导。早在麦播开始，县委就增兵增将，加强生产第一线的领导。最近又以县委第一书记张鸣吾为首，组织了四十多名政策水平较高的干部，一方面检查各地贯彻执行政策和走群众路线情况，一方面帮助分析和及时解决麦田管理运动中的新情况、新问题。这样就使当前麦田管理呈现了一派更好的形势。
    以实现超包产计划为中心的“五赶、二变、一超”运动，在全县各社、队逐步开展后，既使三类麦田得到早管、偏管，也促使一、二类麦田有了进一步提高。现在全县已追肥一遍的有二万三千多亩，浇水一遍的二万一千多亩，松土保墒的二千二百多亩，防治病虫害的五千七百多亩。
