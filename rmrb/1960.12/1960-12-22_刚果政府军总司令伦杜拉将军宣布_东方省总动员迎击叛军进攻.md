Xinhua News Agency, Stanleyville, December 21st: General Lundula, Commander-in-Chief of the Congolese Government Army, told reporters in Stanleyville on the 19th that he had ordered a general mobilization in Orientale Province to resist the offensive that the Mobutu rebels were attempting to launch against Orientale Province.

He said that Mobutu's rebels, coming from Equateur Province, had recently attempted to invade Orientale Province and had reached Bosoko, but were repelled by the Congolese government army.

Speaking about temporarily making Stanleyville the capital of the legitimate Congolese government, Lundula said that Orientale Province would never be separated from the rest of the Congo, and that Stanleyville's status as the capital of the legitimate government was for the purpose of launching a struggle to unify the entire (Congolese) country.

Congolese Acting Prime Minister Gizenga, in a conversation with a reporter from the Indian Press Trust on the 20th, condemned the United States for carrying out activities in the United Nations to have Kasavubu recognized as the Congo's representative to the United Nations. He said that this was a blatant interference in the Congo's internal affairs.

The Deputy Governor of Orientale Province, Manzikala, also accused the United States government's policy toward the Congo of being "imperialistic."

According to the Indian Press Trust, after the United States supported Kasavubu and Mobutu, anti-American sentiment has risen sharply among the people of Orientale Province.

    刚果政府军总司令伦杜拉将军宣布
    东方省总动员迎击叛军进攻
  据新华社21日讯　斯坦利维尔消息：刚果政府军总司令伦杜拉将军19日在斯坦利维尔对新闻记者说，他已下令在东方省实行总动员，以抗击蒙博托叛军企图对东方省发动的进攻。
    他说，来自赤道省的蒙博托叛军最近曾企图侵入东方省，并曾到达博索科，但是刚果政府军击退了叛军。
    伦杜拉在谈到关于把斯坦利维尔暂时作为刚果合法政府的首都一事时说，东方省决不会同刚果其他地方分开，关于斯坦利维尔作为合法政府首都是为了发动斗争、统一（刚果）全国。
    刚果代理总理基赞加20日在对印度报业托辣斯记者谈话时，谴责美国在联合国进行活动，使卡萨武布作为刚果在联合国的代表。他说，这是悍然干涉刚果内政。
    东方省副省长曼齐卡拉也曾指责美国政府对刚果的政策是“帝国主义的”。
    据印度报业托辣斯说，在美国支持卡萨武布和蒙博托之后，东方省人民反美情绪高涨。
