　　Strengthen Management of Overwintering Crops

　　People's communes in rural Guangxi are carrying out field management such as topdressing, cultivation, pest control, and frost prevention according to the growth of winter crops, land conditions, and different varieties. In the Wuzhou area, cadres and commune members are organized to go deep into the fields to check each plot, jointly study, and prescribe the right medicine, so that crop management is better. In the Guilin area, where the temperature is lower, after mobilizing the masses to sum up the past experience in topdressing and nursing winter crops, the method of covering cow dung is widely promoted, which not only fertilizes but also prevents frost and keeps warm.

　　In field management, all localities conscientiously implement the Party's various policies and responsibility systems, further mobilizing the production enthusiasm of the broad masses, and the care of winter crops is more solid than before.

　　Find Ways to Improve Fertilizer Quality

　　The Party branch of the Seventh Team of Yongkang Management District, Dengta Commune, Zhongwei County, Ningxia, improved fertilizer quality through ideological education for commune members, cadres going deep into a livestock pen to conduct "experimental fields," hand-to-hand competitions, and measures such as combining inspection, acceptance, and exchange of experience.

　　Due to the improved fertilizer quality, not only was the labor force occupied by fertilizer accumulation saved, but also the "routine" of accumulating enough fertilizer for the summer fields of the following year by the end of December was broken. All the fertilizer needed for the summer fields of the following year was fully accumulated in mid-November and was gradually transported to the fields.

　　Establish High-Yield Plots with the Production Team as a Unit

　　Guangxing Production Team of Chengbei Commune, Songjiang County, Shanghai, has consistently insisted on establishing high-yield plots with the team as a unit for the past two years. As a result, less labor is used, costs are lower, yields are higher, and the demonstration effect is great. Last year, the total grain output of this team increased by 18% compared with 1958; this year, it has achieved another increase in production. Driven by the high-yield plots, the quality, progress, and field management of the team's autumn-sown "three wheats" and rape this year are all in the forefront of the commune's production teams.

　　Winter Fishing Season in Poyang Lake Begins

　　The winter fishing season production in Poyang Lake, Jiangxi, has begun. More than 24,000 people from more than ten counties in the lake area are driving more than 10,000 fishing boats, active on the vast lake. At present, the daily output of each fishery in the lake area is about 10% higher than the daily output of the same period last year.

　　This year, the county party committees of the counties in the lake area have made preparations as early as possible in order to win a bumper harvest in the winter fishing season. In addition to organizing professional fishermen to fish, they also arranged for some sideline boat teams and commune members to enter the lake to fish.

　　All localities have implemented the policy of doing their best and distributing according to work in fishing, and have organized commune members to carry out competitions under the principle of combining work and rest.

　　Comprehensive Planning of Winter Fodder for Livestock

　　Huangshui'an Production Team of Dazhang Commune, Song County, Henan, has made a comprehensive plan for winter fodder for livestock, with specific regulations on what grass to feed each animal and how much each animal should eat. This achieves planned use of grass, economical use of grass, and solves the contradiction of pigs, cattle, and sheep competing for grass.

　　After the fodder plan was made, different varieties were weighed and put into warehouses or piled into special stacks, managed by special personnel, and special grass was used for special purposes. The team also made arrangements for the fuel of commune members' families, and fodder was not used for heating or cooking.

　　Establish Rural Canteen Guidance Stations

　　Xixindian Commune in Jiaocheng County, Hebei, has generally established canteen guidance stations with the management district as a unit to improve the political awareness and professional level of canteen administrators and cooks. The guidance stations give them regular political classes and select skilled and experienced veterans to conduct business guidance.

　　After the establishment of the guidance stations, good results were quickly achieved. At present, the entire commune has trained more than 120 "good housekeepers" and more than 110 "good cooks."

    要闻快报
    加强越冬作物管理
    广西农村各人民公社根据冬种作物的生长情况、土地条件和不同品种，进行追肥、中耕、防虫、防冻等田间管理。梧州专区各地组织干部、社员深入田间逐块检查，共同研究，对症下药，作物管理得较好。气温较低的桂林专区，发动群众总结了过去冬种作物的追肥护理经验后，普遍推广了盖牛栏粪的办法，既追了肥，又防冻保温。
    在田间管理中，各地认真执行党的各项政策和责任制度，进一步调动了广大群众的生产积极性，冬种作物的护理做得较前踏实。
    多方设法提高肥料质量
    宁夏中卫县灯塔公社永康管理区第七小队党支部通过对社员思想教育，干部深入一个畜圈搞“试验田”，对手竞赛和结合检查验收和交流经验等措施，提高肥料质量。
    由于提高了肥料质量，不仅节省了积肥所占用的劳动力，还打破了历年来12月底积够第二年夏田肥料的“常规”，在11月中旬就全部积足了明年夏田用肥，并陆续运往田头。
    以小队为单位建立丰产片
    上海市松江县城北公社光星生产队，两年来一直坚持以小队为单位建立丰产片。这样做的结果，用工省、成本低、产量高、示范作用很大。去年，这个队粮食总产量比1958年增长18％；今年又获得了增产。在丰产片的带动下，全队今年秋种的“三麦”、油菜，质量、进度和田间管理工作都在全公社各生产队的前列。
    鄱阳湖冬季渔汛开始
    江西鄱阳湖冬季渔汛生产已经开始。湖滨地区的十余县出动二万四千多人，驾驶一万多条渔船，活跃在辽阔的湖面上。目前，湖滨各渔场每天日产量约比去年同期日产量增加10％左右。
    今年湖滨各县县委为了夺取冬季渔汛丰收，都及早作了准备。除组织专业渔民捕捞外，还安排部分副业船队和社员入湖捕鱼。
    各地在捕捞中都贯彻了各尽所能、按劳分配的政策，并在劳逸结合的原则下组织社员们开展竞赛。
    全面规划牲畜过冬饲草
    河南嵩县大章公社黄水庵生产队对冬季牲畜饲草进行了全面规划，什么牲畜吃什么草，每头各吃多少，都有了具体规定。这样就做到计划用草，节约用草，解决了猪、牛、羊三畜争草的矛盾。
    做了饲草规划以后，分别不同品种过秤入仓或堆成专垛，由专人管理，实行专草专用。这个队对社员家庭燃料，也作了安排，烤火、做饭都不用饲草。
    建立农村食堂辅导站
    河北交河县西辛店公社以管理区为单位，普遍建立了食堂辅导站，提高食堂管理员和炊事员的政治觉悟和业务水平。辅导站给他们定期上政治课，挑选业务熟练和有经验的老手进行业务辅导。
    辅导站成立以后，很快收到良好效果。目前全公社已培养了一百二十多名“好管家”和一百一十多名“好厨师”。
