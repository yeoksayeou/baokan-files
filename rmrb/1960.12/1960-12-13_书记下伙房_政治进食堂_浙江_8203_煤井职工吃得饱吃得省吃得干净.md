Xinhua News Agency Report: The employee cafeteria of the 8203 mine of Zhejiang Province's 588 Coal Mine Company, under the leadership of the Party branch, has continuously improved its work, achieving inexpensive and high-quality meals with a variety of choices, so that employees eat their fill, economically, and cleanly, becoming a red banner cafeteria for industrial and mining enterprises throughout the province.

Party Branch Strengthens Leadership, Raises Cooks' Awareness
Strengthening Party leadership and treating the cafeteria as a major undertaking is the main reason why the 8203 mine cafeteria is doing so well. The Party branch secretary of this mine, Guo Shouwen, personally took charge of the cafeteria. He often goes down to the kitchen to participate in labor. At the beginning, he found that some cooks were not very settled in their work, thinking that cafeteria work was "inferior and unpromising." The Party branch then organized cooks to conduct discussions and debates around the issues of "what work is glorious" and "how can catering work better serve production," and at the same time organized them to study the advanced deeds of model cooks from various places. The cooks' sense of responsibility and honor were greatly improved, and they established deep feelings for catering work. The Party branch also helped the cafeteria establish a weekly political study and team meeting system, so that the cooks could regularly understand national affairs, promptly commend advanced deeds, and conduct mutual criticism and self-criticism, continuously improving their enthusiasm for work. The cooks carried out a "five-good" competition comparing political thought, service attitude, food quality, cleanliness and hygiene, and mutual assistance and unity, and conducted a summary evaluation once a month to ensure that the cafeteria would be run better and better.

Organize a "Leap Forward Team" to Implement Democratic Management
While the secretary goes down to the cafeteria to strengthen ideological work, the Party branch selects a group of party members and cadres with high awareness, fair handling of affairs, and enthusiastic service to enrich the cafeteria. After reasonable arrangements by the Party branch, branch committee member and material administrator Zhang Yanping was drawn to serve as the cafeteria manager, party member and excellent financial accountant Li Zhaoheng as the cafeteria accountant, and advanced cook Hu Fuxing as the purchasing agent, etc., and this group of backbone forces formed the cafeteria's "Leap Forward Team." The "Leap Forward Team" is constantly planning for the lives of the employees. They maintain close contact with the masses, handle affairs impartially and selflessly, meticulously calculate everything, practice diligence and thrift, and provide convenience to others. After branch committee member Zhang Yanping served as the cafeteria manager, he often went to employee dormitories, above and below the mine, to solicit workers' opinions on the cafeteria in order to improve the work. Accountant Li Zhaoheng handled affairs proactively and enthusiastically, and he had plans for daily meals, vegetable consumption, and grain usage. In order to allow the employees to eat their fill, well, and economically, the cooks proposed "making coarse grains refined and fine grains clever," and worked hard to improve their cooking skills.

The 8203 mine's cafeteria management system is relatively sound. The life management committee, composed of representatives democratically elected by various teams, sections, and offices, holds three regular meetings each month to summarize and inspect the cafeteria's work, review the cafeteria's financial accounts, and usually widely solicit opinions from the masses, mobilizing the masses to participate in the cafeteria's management work. The cafeteria staff also consciously place themselves under the supervision of the masses, listening to the opinions of the masses to run the cafeteria well. The accounts are cleared daily, settled every ten days, and announced monthly.

Develop a "Family Fortune" and Reform Cooking Utensils
Establishing a non-staple food production base for the cafeteria is an important condition for running the cafeteria well. The Party branch organized employees' families to reclaim barren mountains to grow vegetables, melons, and beans, and raise chickens, ducks, pigs, and sheep. The employees used the gaps in production to reclaim wasteland and planted more than 40 mu of Chinese cabbage, pickled mustard greens, radishes, garlic, and other vegetables. They also used wild feed and high-mountain reservoirs to raise 63 pigs and sheep, 1,400 chickens and ducks, and 14,000 fish. In order to increase vegetable production, they adopted methods of "interplanting, overlapping planting, and insert planting" on the one hand, and tried every means to improve land utilization; on the other hand, they visited the wise and learned from experience everywhere to improve vegetable cultivation techniques, so that every vegetable planted grew well and quickly.

With the continuous improvement of the cafeteria's service quality, a contradiction of insufficient labor appeared. In order to solve this problem in a timely manner, the Party branch mobilized cooks, ironworkers, carpenters, etc. to cooperate fully and carry out cooking utensil reform on a large scale. With the help of carpenters and ironworkers, kitchen squad leader Li Chunlai successfully innovated four or five kinds of machines, such as a vegetable cutting machine and a rice washing machine, which greatly improved the efficiency of cutting vegetables, washing rice, etc. They have innovated and promoted 22 new machines (pieces) such as rice washing machines, steamed bread cutting machines, and dumpling wrapping devices, achieving "no knife needed for cutting vegetables, no carrying needed for drinking water, no hands needed for washing rice," and the work efficiency has increased by more than one time. The ratio of catering staff to diners has increased from 1:28 in the past to 1:70. (Attached picture)

    书记下伙房  政治进食堂
    浙江8203煤井职工吃得饱吃得省吃得干净
    本报讯　浙江省588煤矿公司8203矿井职工食堂，在党支部的领导下，不断改进工作，做到了饭菜价廉物美，花色多样，使职工们吃得饱，吃得省，吃得干净，成为全省工矿企业的一个红旗食堂。
    党支部加强领导提高炊事员觉悟
    加强党的领导，把食堂当成大事来抓，是8203井食堂办得好的主要原因。这个井的党支部书记郭守文亲自挂帅抓食堂。他经常下伙房参加劳动。开始时，发现有的炊事员不大安心工作，认为食堂工作“低人一等，没出息”。党支部便组织炊事员围绕“什么工作光荣”、“炊事工作怎样更好地为生产服务”等问题，开展鸣放辩论，同时组织他们学习各地模范炊事员的先进事迹。炊事员的工作责任感、光荣感大大提高，对炊事工作建立了深厚的感情。党支部还帮助食堂建立了一周各一次的政治学习和班务会议制度，使炊事员们能经常了解国家大事，及时表扬先进事迹，相互开展批评和自我批评，不断提高工作积极性。炊事员之间开展了比政治思想、比服务态度、比饭菜质量、比清洁卫生、比互助团结的“五好”竞赛，每月进行一次总结评比，保证食堂越办越好。
    组织“跃进班子”实行民主管理
    在书记下食堂，加强思想工作的同时，党支部挑选了一批觉悟高、办事公道、服务热心的党员、干部，充实食堂。党支部经过合理安排，抽出支部委员、材料管理员张堰平担任食堂管理员，党员、优秀财务会计李兆衡担任食堂会计，先进炊事员胡富兴当采购员等，并由这批骨干力量组成了食堂的“跃进班子”。“跃进班子”时刻为职工生活打算。他们密切联系群众，办事大公无私，处处精打细算，克勤克俭，与人方便。支部委员张堰平担任食堂管理员以后，经常到职工宿舍、井上、井下，征求工人对食堂的意见，据以改进工作。会计李兆衡办事主动热情，一日三餐吃菜用粮，他都有计划。炊事员为了让职工们吃得又饱又好又省，提出“粗粮细作，细粮巧做”，努力提高烹饪技术。
    8203井的食堂管理制度比较健全。由各班组、科室民主推选代表组成的生活管理委员会，每月举行三次例会，总结检查食堂工作，审查食堂财务账目，平时经常广泛征求群众意见，发动群众参加食堂管理工作。食堂工作人员也自觉地把自己置于群众监督之下，倾听群众意见来办好食堂，账目做到日清，旬结，月月公布。
    发展“家底”改革炊具
    建立食堂的副食品生产基地，是办好食堂的一个重要条件。党支部组织职工家属开荒山种蔬菜瓜豆，养鸡鸭猪羊。职工们利用生产间隙开荒地，种了四十多亩大白菜、雪里红、萝卜、大蒜等蔬菜。他们还利用野生饲料、高山水库养了六十三头猪羊、一千四百只鸡鸭、一万四千尾鱼。为了提高蔬菜产量，他们一面采用“夹种、套种、插种”的办法，千方百计提高土地利用率；一面到处访贤取经，改进蔬菜培育技术，使种下的蔬菜棵棵长得既好又快。
    随着食堂服务质量的不断提高，出现了劳力不足的矛盾。为了及时解决这一问题，党支部发动炊事员、铁工、木工等通力协作，大搞炊具改革。炊事班长李春来在木工、铁工的帮助下，革新成功切菜机、淘米机等四、五种机具，大大提高了切菜、淘米等效率。他们已经革新推广了淘米机、切馒头机、包饺器等二十二台（件）新机具，做到了“切菜不用刀，喝水不用挑，淘米不用手”，工效提高一倍以上。炊事人员和就餐人员的比例由过去一比二十八提高到一比七十。（附图片）
