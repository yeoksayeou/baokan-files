    Lao Combat Forces Radio Station Publishes Commentary Pointing Out
    Thai Reactionary Authorities Are Running Dogs of American Aggression
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 24th - The Lao Combat Forces Radio Station published a commentary on the 23rd regarding the intensified crimes of the Thai reactionary authorities in interfering with and invading Laos. The commentary emphasized that "The Thai reactionary authorities are the most effective running dogs for American imperialism in realizing its plot to invade Laos and turn Laos into an American colony and military base."
    The commentary listed facts, saying that the Thai reactionary authorities have consistently supported the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique, and even dispatched Thai troops mixed into the traitorous clique's army to directly invade Laos.
    The commentary then revealed that after the Royal Lao Government forces, the armed forces of the Lao Combat Forces, and the people of Vientiane withdrew from the capital, the Thai reactionary clique became even more blatant in its aggression against Laos. From December 16th to 20th, Sarit Thanarat came to Nong Khai to plot the conspiracy to expand military activities north of Vientiane. Recently, the Thai reactionary authorities dispatched transport planes from Bangkok carrying weapons and ammunition to Vientiane, preparing to launch an offensive against the Lao government forces and the armed forces of the Lao Combat Forces. News from northeastern Thailand said that the command headquarters of various military regions in Thailand have ordered paratroopers and infantrymen to disguise themselves as troops of the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique and go to Vientiane to coordinate operations.
    The commentary emphatically pointed out that "The above-mentioned actions of the Thai authorities demonstrate that they are deliberately expanding their aggression against and interference in Laos, and blatantly infringing upon Laos' sovereignty. This behavior is a barbaric act that violates international law and seriously threatens the peace of Indochina and Southeast Asia."
    The commentary said that the Thai reactionaries must bear full responsibility for all the consequences caused by their criminal acts.
    The commentary said that the Lao people have always regarded the Thai people as their closest neighbors and believe that the justice-upholding Thai people will work together with the Lao people to stop the interference in Laos by the American lackey, the Thai reactionary faction.
    The commentary called on the governments and people of all peace-loving countries in the world to support the Lao people's struggle and take effective measures to force American imperialism and the Thai reactionaries to stop their aggression against Laos. (Attached picture)

    寮国战斗部队电台发表评论指出
    泰国反动当局是美国侵略走卒
    据新华社河内24日电　寮国战斗部队电台23日就泰国反动当局加紧干涉和侵略老挝的罪行发表评论。评论强调指出，“泰国反动当局是美帝国主义实现其侵略老挝，把老挝变成美国的殖民地和军事基地的阴谋中最得力的走卒。”
    评论列举事实说，泰国反动当局一直支持富米卖国集团，甚至派遣泰国军队混进叛国集团的军队，直接侵略老挝。
    评论接着揭露，在老挝王国政府军、寮国战斗部队武装力量和万象人民撤出首都以后，泰国反动集团就更加明目张胆地侵略老挝。12月16日至20日，乃沙立来到廊开策划扩大在万象北面的军事活动的阴谋。最近，泰国反动当局派遣运输机，从曼谷载运武器弹药到万象，准备向老挝政府军和寮国战斗部队武装力量发动攻势。来自泰国东北的消息说，泰国各个军区的指挥部已经命令伞兵和步兵乔装成富米叛国集团部队，前往万象配合行动。
    评论着重指出，“泰国当局的上述行动说明，它们蓄意扩大对老挝的侵略和干涉，明目张胆地侵犯了老挝的主权。这种行为是违反国际法的野蛮行为，并严重地威胁了印度支那和东南亚的和平。”
    评论说，泰国反动派必须对他们的罪恶行为所造成的一切后果担负全部责任。
    评论说，老挝人民一贯把泰国人民视为最亲切的邻居，并相信主持正义的泰国人民，一定会和老挝人民一起努力制止美国的仆从泰国反动派对老挝的干涉。
    评论呼吁全世界爱好和平国家的政府和人民支持老挝人民的斗争，并采取有效措施，迫使美帝国主义和泰国反动派停止对老挝的侵略。（附图片）
