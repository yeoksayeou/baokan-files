    Meticulous and In-depth Ideological Work, Caring for the Masses With Utmost Care
    Production Team Leader Ma Shunyou Leads Effectively
    (Our Dispatch) Ma Shunyou, a Communist Party member and the leader of the Second Squad of the Dujiaping Production Team in Qiutou People's Commune, Ning County, Gansu Province, has established a work style of consulting with the masses on everything and taking the lead in everything. As a result, the entire squad is full of production enthusiasm, the commune members are in a cheerful mood, and their work spirit is high, making it a red flag among all the squad leaders in the commune.
    Ma Shunyou believes that the first thing a squad leader should do is to care for the masses politically and in their lives. He said, "Although a squad has only about a hundred people, there are a hundred different personalities. Everyone is different. Only when everyone is of one mind and working together with one heart and one mind can we improve the production of the squad."
    How does he do the work of uniting people? Ma Shunyou has two methods: The first is to explain the reasons clearly and persuade and educate, so that everyone is convinced from the bottom of their hearts. The second is to patiently help, find the root of the problem, and resolve the conflicts. For example, commune member Fan Yuancheng was not very energetic in his work for a while. Ma Shunyou went to Fan Yuancheng's home and, after comparing the present with the past and providing various inspirations, Fan Yuancheng finally revealed what was on his mind. It turned out that Fan Yuancheng was not a bad worker, but a cadre in the team had criticized him several times for no reason, which affected his mood. Ma Shunyou then said to him: "The cadre wronged you for no reason, which was wrong of him. The team has already criticized him, and of course you can also give him your opinion. However, it is wrong of you to sulk and not work hard. Think about it, we are all poor peasants, and we suffered in the past. Today we are the masters of our own house. The Party trusts us and relies on us. How can we not work hard and live up to the Party?" After he said this, the knot in Fan Yuancheng's heart was untied, his mood was cheerful, and he became active in his work. Ma Shunyou also deeply realized that whether or not the commune members listen to the cadres not only depends on caring for them ideologically and politically, but also on caring for the commune members' lives and helping them solve specific problems. Commune member Zhang Hua was a lonely old man who became ill once. Ma Shunyou sent someone to invite a doctor and personally went to Zhang Hua's home to visit him. Zhang Hua was deeply moved and joined the labor force as soon as he recovered.
    In the leadership work of the squad, in addition to discussing matters with everyone, Ma Shunyou also invited old farmers Lu Zhikuan, Lu Bangdao, and Wei Xingyuan, who are ideologically progressive, have rich agricultural production knowledge, have high prestige among the masses, and are enthusiastic about the team's affairs, to be "advisors." This year, when planting wheat, it was due to discussing with the "advisors" that they adopted the order of sowing first in the mountains, then in the plains, first on the shady slopes, and then on the sunny slopes. As a result, the wheat seedlings in the mountains and plains grew very well, and they were planted just in time.
    Ma Shunyou is a squad leader, but he never stands aside to direct the commune members in production. He often walks in front when going to work and walks in the back when leaving work, leading the commune members with his own exemplary actions. He said, "Cadres should lead the way for the commune members. If you lead correctly and walk upright, the commune members will not go astray." There was a feeder in the squad who was careless in feeding the livestock and did not add night grass to the livestock at night. After Ma Shunyou found out, he went to live in the feeding room and added grass to the livestock three times a night every night. After doing this for a few days, he moved the feeder, who got up several times a night to add grass to the livestock. Because Ma Shunyou can lead by example, he not only motivated the commune members' enthusiasm for production, but also his own labor is very outstanding. Now, Ma Shunyou earns more than 360 work points every month. The commune members said, "Our Captain Ma is a model in work and a hero in labor."
    The production of this squad is good, and the commune members are in a good mood. Another main reason is that Ma Shunyou adopted the mass line working method in implementing the policies, so the policies are well implemented. This year, the wheat was sown in a timely and good manner, mainly due to the implementation of the "three guarantees and one reward" policy, which mobilized the commune members' enthusiasm for production. Originally, the autumn fields had already been realized according to the original "three guarantees" measures, but the commune members actively applied fertilizer again. (Photo attached)

### 思想工作细致深入　关心群众无微不至  生产队长马顺有领导有方

    思想工作细致深入　关心群众无微不至
    生产队长马顺有领导有方
    本报讯　甘肃宁县湫头人民公社杜家坪生产队第二小队队长、共产党员马顺有，在工作中树立遇事与群众商量的作风，事事带头先干。结果整个小队生产热气腾腾，社员心情舒畅，干劲旺盛，成为全社小队长中的一面红旗。
    马顺有当小队长，头一条就是从政治、生活上关心群众。他说：“一个小队虽只有一百来人，但是百人百性，一个人和一个人不一样。只有大家一条心、一股劲，口齐心齐，说干一起干，才能把小队生产搞好。”
    他是怎样做好人的工作呢？马顺有有两条办法：第一条是讲清道理，说服教育，使每个人心悦诚服。第二条是耐心帮助，找病根，解疙瘩。如社员范元成有一段时间干活不带劲。马顺有找到范元成家里，经过比前比后，多方启发，范元成才说出了心里话。原来范元成劳动不坏，但队里有个干部无故批评了他几回，影响了他的情绪。马顺有便对他说：“干部无故难为你，这是他的不对，队里已经对他进行了批评，当然你也可以给他提出意见。但是，赌气不好好劳动，这就是你的不对了。你想，咱都是贫农，过去受苦受难，今天当家作了主，党相信咱、依靠咱，再不好好劳动，还能对得起党？”经他这一说，范元成心里的疙瘩解开了，心情舒畅，劳动也积极了。马顺有还深切体会到：社员听不听干部的话，不仅要从思想政治上关心，还要关心社员的生活，帮助他们解决具体问题。社员张华是个孤独老汉，一次生了病，马顺有一面派人去请医生，一面亲自到张华家里探望，张华深受感动，病一好就参加了劳动。
    马顺有在小队领导工作中，除了和大家商量办事外，他还拜请了思想进步、有丰富农业生产知识、群众威信高、热心队里事的老农路治宽、路帮道、魏兴元当“参谋”。今年种麦时，就是由于和“参谋”们在一起商量，采取先山地，后川地，先阴山，后阳山的次序播种。结果山川地的麦子出苗都很好，恰恰种到了时节上。
    马顺有是小队长，但他从来不站在一边指挥社员生产。他经常是上工走在前面，下工走在后面，以自己的模范行动带动社员。他说：“干部要给社员引路，你引得端，走得正，社员就走不歪。”小队有个饲养员，喂牲口不经心，晚上不给牲口添夜草。马顺有知道后，就去住到饲养室里，每天晚上定时给牲口添三次草。这样做了几天，感动了这个饲养员，一晚上起来好几次给牲口添草。因为马顺有能够以身作则，不仅带动了社员们的生产积极性，自己的劳动也非常出色。现在，马顺有每月都要做到三百六十多工分。社员们说：“我们的马队长，工作是模范，劳动是英雄。”
    这个小队的生产搞得好，社员心情舒畅，另外一个主要原因是马顺有在贯彻政策中，采取了群众路线的工作方法，所以政策贯彻执行得好，今年小麦播种适时又好，主要是贯彻执行了“三包一奖”的政策，调动社员的生产积极性。本来秋田按原“三包”措施已经实现，但社员又积极地追施了一次肥料。（附图片）
