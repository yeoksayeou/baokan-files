Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 8th December: The U.S. State Department issued a statement on the 7th, doing its utmost to deny the U.S. crimes of obstructing Korean reunification, and emphasized that the U.S. aggressor troops would continue to remain in South Korea. The U.S. State Department's statement was issued in response to a statement issued by the Soviet government on the same day on the Korean issue. The Soviet government's statement accused the U.S. of obstructing Korean reunification and demanded that U.S. troops withdraw from South Korea. The U.S. State Department, reversing black and white, said that the U.S. government had been "seeking the unification of Korea," while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea "with the support of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists, has been obstructing the reunification of Korea." The U.S. statement reiterated the U.S.'s stubborn position of insisting on holding "free elections" in Korea under the so-called "supervision of the United Nations," and clamored that the U.S. military had no intention of withdrawing from South Korea until the Korean issue was resolved according to U.S. intentions.

    美国务院抵赖阻挠朝鲜统一罪行
    声称美国无意从朝鲜撤军
    新华社8日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院7日发表声明，竭力抵赖美国阻挠朝鲜统一的罪行，并且强调美国的侵略军队要继续赖在南朝鲜。美国国务院的声明是针对苏联政府在同一天就朝鲜问题发表的一项声明而发表的。苏联政府的声明指责美国阻挠朝鲜统一并且要求美国军队撤出南朝鲜。美国国务院颠倒黑白地说什么美国政府一直在“谋求朝鲜的统一”，而朝鲜民主主义人民共和国“在苏联和中国共产党的支持下却在阻挠朝鲜的重新统一”。美国的声明重申美国坚持在所谓“联合国的监督下”在朝鲜举行“自由选举”的顽固立场，并且叫嚷在朝鲜问题按照美国的意旨解决以前，美国军队无意撤出南朝鲜。
