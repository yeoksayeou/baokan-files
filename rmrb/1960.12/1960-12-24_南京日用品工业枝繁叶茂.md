    Nanjing's Daily-Use Goods Industry Flourishes
    Su Xin
    People familiar with local specialties naturally think of Nanjing's famous salted duck and brocade when Nanjing is mentioned. In fact, Nanjing's local specialties, especially its emerging light industry, have long surpassed these two items in representation. At the end of this first year of the 1960s, if you stroll through the streets and alleys of the city and suburbs, you will find not only soap factories, textile factories, enamel factories, and radio factories with local state-owned and joint state-private signs next to steel mills and machine factories, but also more community-run factories. If you then go to the New Street or Drum Tower department stores, you will see Nanjing-produced daily-use industrial products displayed in the windows and on the shelves, such as "Panda" radios and "Purple Mountain" alarm clocks... They have become daily necessities loved by the people of Nanjing, and some have gained considerable reputation throughout the country and even abroad.

    New Recruits in the "Famous Brand" Ranks

    People who have lived in Nanjing for a long time know that before liberation, Nanjing had neither steel industry nor much light industry. The Kuomintang capital with a population of one million had only two yarn factories that relied solely on speculating in cotton yarn, with a combined total of only three thousand spindles. The quality of the few light industrial products available at that time was also very poor; socks would develop holes after only one wearing and towels would disintegrate after only one use. People sarcastically referred to them as "through-the-street" socks and "fishing net" towels. After liberation, Nanjing's light and textile industries have grown significantly from scratch, from few to many. Especially after three consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward, the ranks of light industry have grown rapidly and expanded, and more and more "Nanjing brands" have appeared on the market. Today, whether in old department stores like Central Shopping Center, or in newly opened department stores in Drum Tower and Shanxi Road, there are Yangtze River brand soaps, Drum Tower brand toothpastes, Yuhua brand pens, Purple Mountain brand alarm clocks, washbasins and mugs, as well as Nanjing brand batteries and gold pens... The woolen yarn needed by people in the winter season is the "Yangtze River brand" from Nanjing, and the peony lanolin and ballet cream used to protect the skin are also local products. Among the thirty-two major light industrial products sold in the Nanjing market, except for stainless steel pots, flashlights, and blankets that cannot be produced locally yet, others have begun to have Nanjing brands. As for small commodities and small hardware items, they are even more diverse and colorful. From shoes, hats, and clothing to tables, chairs, and furniture, from vegetable baskets and rice baskets to pots, bowls, ladles, and spoons, from candies and pastries to children's toys, from sports equipment to stationery and paper, the variety is increasing, estimated at no less than two thousand four hundred kinds.

    In the early days of liberation, consumers in Nanjing were always accustomed to buying old famous brands produced in Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places. But now, when people go to stores to buy daily necessities, they also begin to inquire about Nanjing's new famous brands. In recent years, some of the daily-use industrial products produced in Nanjing have begun to enter the ranks of famous brands. For example, the Worker-Peasant-Soldier brand undershirt has caught up with the old famous brand "Goose brand" undershirt in terms of shrinkage and appearance. In addition, the quality of peony lanolin, Liberation basketballs, Drum Tower toothpaste, Peacock bedsheets, velvets, and silk velvets has also caught up with the level of national famous brands of the same category in certain indicators.

    "Nanjing Brand" Mounts the Leap Forward Horse

    Why has Nanjing's daily-use industry, with its poor industrial base, developed in this way? When you visit these factories with this question, the workers will excitedly tell you: this is the power of the General Line. You see, since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, miracles of producing a new product in a few days and filling a gap in a few days have been countless on the light industry front in Nanjing! The Kuomintang's pseudo-Resources Committee spent thirteen years trying to build a factory to manufacture radios, but by the time of liberation, it could only assemble "Philco" radios for the Americans. However, in the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, Nanjing established the Oriental Radio Factory, which began to trial-produce radios in just over ten days. This factory was founded by three demobilized soldiers and dozens of students from private schools, inspired by the Party's call to run industry on a large scale. At that time, they borrowed a few rooms from a printing factory, used a few temporary tables, and practiced operation at night when the state-owned factories were resting. During the day, they invited master workers from state-owned factories to teach them. In just twelve days, people who originally knew nothing basically mastered single operations and started a factory producing radios. Three years later today, this small factory, which originally had only dozens of people, has developed into a factory with more than eight hundred people with a preliminary scale.

    On Zhongshan South Road, there is a Jinling Rubber Factory. Looking at its current production scale, who would believe that three years ago it was just a three-person rubber shoe trial production group? It was in April 1958 that Yao Huaiyi and Shi Gongfu, workers in a subsidiary workshop of the Nanjing Glass Factory—the thermos rubber pad workshop—were encouraged by the Great Leap Forward and decided to fill a gap in Nanjing's light industry—galoshes. Therefore, with the support of the workshop Party branch, they established a technical research group with them as the main force and quickly began trial production. To make rubber shoes, the first thing is to have a machine to roll the rubber well. They didn't have one, so they modified a very small old roller into a rolling machine. When the rubber was rolled out, they needed a vulcanization tank to steam it. Where could they find such a large boiler at that time? So they used a pot to steam it; the first time, all the rubber was vaporized, the second time they used a small iron box to装起来蒸it, but it still didn't work, the third time, someone suggested putting it in the factory's glass-baking kiln, but it got burnt again... In this way, after a total of ten failures, they finally produced the first pair of galoshes. "With the first pair, there will be a second pair, a third pair." In 1958, this factory produced thousands of pairs of galoshes, and last year it developed to more than 286,000 pairs. In the first eleven months of this year, they have already produced more than 480,000 pairs. Half of the galoshes sold in the Nanjing market this year are the "Yangtze River brand" produced by this factory.

    Better and Better

    After entering the first year of the 1960s, Nanjing's light industry has made further progress on the basis of two consecutive years of the Leap Forward. In the movement of the whole people making technical innovation and technical revolution, the light textile workers in Nanjing put forward the ambitious slogan of "Setting great ambitions, boosting great energy, tackling cutting-edge technology, and catching up with famous brands." They are determined to make the light industry developed in the Great Leap Forward appear with more products catching up with famous brands, and to make the Nanjing brand more and more loved by consumers. In many light industrial factories, workers set up challenges to compete and made ambitious goals. The "Worker-Peasant-Soldier brand" undershirt produced by the Nanjing Knitwear Factory has long been slightly better than the "Goose brand" undershirt only in terms of appearance, and all other aspects were inferior to the "Goose brand." This time, in order to make "Worker-Peasant-Soldier" catch up with "Goose brand," in order to constantly motivate themselves, they hung "Goose brand" undershirts one by one in the corridor, and listed them side by side with their own factory's products for comparison. They said, "We won't take them down until we catch up with the famous brand!" More than half a month later, they finally caught up with "Goose brand" in terms of shrinkage, fulfilling their wishes.

    Like the Knitwear Factory, light industry workers across the city launched a climax of comparing with famous brands, catching up with famous brands, and creating famous brands. Many workers have become "innovation addicts" and "famous brand addicts" in order to make their products catch up with famous brands; before catching up with famous brands, workers in many factories first learned the advanced experience of brotherly regions and brotherly factories. The Nanjing Gold Pen Factory used to be a factory that only produced pens. To produce gold pens, especially to make their own gold pens catch up with the Hero brand of Shanghai, what a difficult thing this is! However, after the old workers of this factory collectively discussed the design, they were determined to design gold pens that could be "unique" in appearance and quality. In the trial production process, overcoming the key "water leakage temperature difference" was a decisive battle. Master worker Tian Yougen, who was in charge of tackling the problem, did not succeed after five days of experimentation, but he was not discouraged and insisted on experimenting. One night, the workers who were experimenting with him repeatedly persuaded him to rest, and even finally bolted the workshop door to prevent him from entering again, but in order to test the first Nanjing brand name gold pen, he pried open the door and ran in again. The workers of this factory, with the bold innovation of Master Tian Yougen, broke through the technical and equipment barriers of trial-producing famous pens, so that Nanjing gold pens were not only trial-produced in five months, but also caught up with famous brands in certain quality indicators. The Luda Glass Factory produces a kind of cased glass cup, which is transparent, beautiful and artistic. In order to learn the technology of producing this glass cup, the Nanjing Glass Factory specially bought samples from the exhibition held in Guangzhou, carefully studied them, and specially organized a team to study in Luda. After returning, they listed eight catch-up indicators, learning and catching up one by one. Now they have mastered the skills of the elder brother factory in terms of color matching, cup shape and stress. When the Zhengque Battery Factory improved the quality of Nanjing brand batteries, the Shanghai Huiming Battery Factory also specially sent people to help them, giving them great support.

    A New Force Rises

    With the arrival of the climax of the urban people's commune movement, the ranks of community-run industries are growing. The rise of this new force has greatly strengthened the lineup of the production front of daily-use industrial products.

    That was in April and May of this year, when various districts successively established urban people's communes, comprehensively organized economic life, and set up factories, canteens, and nurseries. Many housewives walked out of the kitchen and into the factory, and many people who used to only consume daily necessities have now become active members of producing daily necessities. In the Sanxiaohe area of the Xiaguan People's Commune, there are more than seventy housewives, some of whom are family members of boat people and some of whom are street residents. In the past, every time they went to the department store, they always liked to buy soft towels, gloves, and other daily necessities, but they never knew how these things were produced. Since they more than seventy people set up a cotton weaving factory, it only took a month or so to learn the technology of weaving towels and gloves, and they also competed with the older brother factory - Nanjing Towel Factory, so that the quality of the mass-produced towels produced by their factory reached the advanced level of the city's cotton weaving industry. Before setting up the factory, if they used two towels per household per year, they would use more than 140 towels a year. Since setting up the factory to the present for more than twenty months, they have produced nearly 300,000 towels, enough to supply one towel per household in the city. Therefore, Fang Guangshun, the director of this factory, always excitedly introduces to everyone: "Our factory was illuminated by the General Line, leaped out by the Great Leap Forward, and established by the People's Commune!"

    The establishment of the People's Commune has not only made many people who have never produced daily-use industrial products become a new force on the production front of daily-use industrial products, but also made many areas that were typical consumer areas in the past become areas producing daily-use industrial products. Confucius Temple is a famous consumer area in Nanjing City in the old society. The streets were full of taverns, teahouses, and acrobatic fields. After liberation and before 1958, this area underwent transformation and its appearance changed greatly. But at that time, there was still not a single factory. In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, seven factories were set up here. In April of this year, a branch of the People's Commune was established in this area, and more than thirty factories were set up at once, including thirteen factories with seven hundred and fifty-one people specializing in the production of daily-use industrial products. After many areas established People's Communes, the community-run factories that were set up have already undertaken the production tasks of small commodities. Before the establishment of the Shengzhou Road Branch of the Jianye People's Commune, the daily-use small hardware products such as hair clips, iron-clad locks, and rattles in this area were all manufactured by the district-owned Pioneer Hardware Factory and Jianye Electric Motor Factory. Since the Shengzhou Road Branch was established and a community-run hardware factory was set up, not only were all these products decentralized to the community-run factory, but also the variety of products produced has increased by 1.2 times compared to the past.

    南京日用品工业枝繁叶茂
    苏新
    熟悉地方土特产的人，在谈到南京的时候，很自然地会想到著名的板鸭和云锦。其实，南京的土特产，特别是南京新兴的轻工业，却早已不是这两样东西所能代表的了。在这六十年代第一年的岁末，如果你到城里郊外的大街小巷去逛一逛，不但会发现在钢铁厂、机器厂的一旁，有许多挂着地方国营和公私合营招牌的肥皂厂、纺织厂、搪瓷厂、无线电厂，而且还会看到更多的社办工厂。如果你再到新街口或鼓楼百货商店去走一走，又会看到在橱窗里，在货架上摆着的南京出产的日用工业品，像“熊猫牌”收音机、“紫金山牌”闹钟，……它们已成为南京人民心目中所喜爱的日用品，有的在全国各地以至在国外都有了相当的声誉。
    “名牌”行列中的新兵
    久住南京的人，都知道解放前的南京既没有钢铁工业也没有什么轻工业，一个拥有百万人口的国民党首都，不过只有两家专靠搞棉纱投机赚钱的纱厂，合起来只不过三千个纱锭；而当时仅有的一些轻工业品，质量也十分低劣，袜子一穿就通，毛巾一用就坏，人们讽刺为“过街通”袜子和“鱼网牌”毛巾。解放以后，南京的轻纺工业已经从无到有、从少到多，有了很大的发展，特别是经过连续三年的大跃进，轻工业的队伍迅速成长、扩大，愈来愈多的“南京牌”在市场上出现了。如今，不论是在像中央商场这样的老商场，或是在鼓楼、山西路新辟的百货商店里，都有长江牌的香皂，鼓楼牌的牙膏，雨花牌的钢笔，紫金山牌的闹钟、脸盆和口杯，还有南京牌的电池和金笔。……冬令季节里人们需要的毛线，是南京出的“长江牌”，保护皮肤用的牡丹香脂、芭蕾霜，也是本地的产品。南京市场上出售的三十二种主要轻工业品中，除了钢精锅、电筒、毛毯本地暂时还不能生产外，其他的都开始有了南京的牌子。至于那些小百货、小五金商品就更是五花八门，丰富多彩了。从鞋帽、服装到桌、椅、家具，从菜篮、米箩到锅、碗、瓢、勺，从糖果、糕点到儿童玩具，从运动器具到文具纸张，品种愈来愈多，算一算不下二千四百多种。
    解放初期南京的消费者们走进百货商店，总是习惯购买上海、天津等地出产的老名牌，但现在，人们到商店选购日用品时，也开始打听起南京的新名牌了。今年来，南京自己生产的日用工业品中，已有一部分开始跨入了名牌行列。像工农兵牌汗衫，已在缩水和外观等方面，赶上了老名牌“鹅牌”汗衫，其他，牡丹香脂、解放篮球、鼓楼牙膏、孔雀被单、天鹅绒、真丝绒等产品的质量，也在某些指标上，分别赶上了全国同类名牌货的水平。
    “南京牌”跨上跃进马
    为什么工业基础很差的南京日用工业会有这样的发展？当你带着这个问题去走访这些工厂时，职工们会兴奋地告诉你：这是总路线的威力。你看，自从1958年大跃进以来，在南京市轻工业战线上，几天生产一个新产品、几天补一个缺门的奇迹，真是不胜枚举！国民党伪资源委员会曾经花了十三年时间，想搞一个制造收音机的工厂，结果到了临解放时，还是只能替美国人装配装配“飞哥”牌收音机。而在大跃进的1958年，南京出了个东方无线电厂，只花了十几天时间，就开始试制收音机了。这家工厂是由三个复员军人和几十个民办学校的学生，在党的大办工业的号召鼓舞下创办起来的。当时，他们借用了一家印刷厂的几间房屋，用几张临时搭起的台子，晚上，趁国营大厂休息时去实习操作，白天就请国营厂的老师傅们给他们上课。短短的十二天，原来什么都不懂的人，基本上掌握了单项操作，办起了一家生产收音机的工厂。到三年后的今天，这家原来只有几十个人的小厂，已经发展成了八百多人的初具规模的工厂了。
    在中山南路上，有一家金陵橡胶厂，看看它今天的生产规模，谁又会相信三年前它不过是一个三个人的胶鞋试制小组呢？那是在1958年4月，南京玻璃厂一个附属车间——热水瓶橡胶垫车间工人姚怀义和史功甫，受了大跃进的鼓舞，决心要为南京轻工业补上一个缺门——套鞋，于是在车间党支部的支持下，以他们两人为主建立了一个技术研究小组，便迅速开始了试制。做胶鞋，首先要有个机器把橡胶轧好，他们没有，用一架很小的旧滚筒改装成一台轧制机，胶轧出来了，要有硫化缸把它蒸熟，那么大的锅炉一时哪里去找，他们便用一口锅来蒸；第一次，橡胶全部蒸化掉了，第二次用个小铁箱装起来蒸，还是不行，第三次，有人建议放到厂里烘玻璃的窑里烘，结果又烘糊了……就这样，一共经过十次失败，他们终于搞出了第一双套鞋。“有了第一双，就会有第二双、第三双”。1958年那年，他们这个厂共生产了几千双胶鞋，去年又发展到二十八万六千多双，今年十一个月里，他们已经生产了四十八万多双了。今年南京市场上出售的胶鞋，有一半就是这个厂出的“长江牌”。
    好些，再好些
    跨入六十年代的第一年以后，南京的轻工业在连续两年跃进的基础上，又有了进一步的发展。在全民大闹技术革新和技术革命的运动中，南京市的轻纺工人雄心勃勃地提出了“立大志、鼓大劲、攻尖端、赶名牌”的口号，他们决心叫大跃进中发展起来的轻工业，出现更多的赶上名牌的产品，叫南京牌愈来愈得到消费者们的喜爱。在许许多多轻工业工厂里，工人们设擂比武，立下了雄心壮志。南京针织内衣厂出的“工农兵牌”汗衫，长期以来除了外观一个指标比“鹅牌”汗衫要稍好些外，其它都不如“鹅牌”。这一次，他们为了叫“工农兵”赶上“鹅牌”，为了经常激励自己，把“鹅牌”汗衫一件件挂在走廊上，并且把它和自己厂的产品列表对比，挂在一起，他们说：“一天不赶上名牌，我们一天不把它们拿下来！”半个多月以后，终于在缩水率等方面赶上了“鹅牌”，实现了他们的愿望。
    和针织内衣厂一样，全市轻工业工人掀起了比名牌、赶名牌、创名牌高潮。许多职工为了使产品赶上名牌，出现了许许多多的“革新迷”“赶名牌迷”；许多工厂的工人在赶名牌以前，首先学习了兄弟地区、兄弟工厂的先进经验。南京金笔厂过去是一家只生产钢笔的工厂，要生产金笔，特别是要使自己的金笔赶上上海的英雄牌，这是何等困难的事啊！但是，当这个厂的老工人们集体讨论设计以后，他们却决心要设计出外形、质量上都能“独树一帜”的金笔来。在试制过程中，攻破“漏水温差”这个关键是决定性的一仗。负责攻关的田友根老师傅经过五天的试验，都没有成功，但他毫不灰心，坚持试验。一天晚上，和他一起试验的工人们几次三番劝他去休息，甚至最后把车间的门闩上不再让他进来，但他为了试验出第一支南京牌的名牌金笔，把门撬开又跑了进来。这个厂的工人们，就是以田友根师傅这种大胆革新的劲头，冲破了试制名笔的技术关、设备关，使南京金笔在五个月中不仅试制了出来，而且在某些质量指标上赶上了名牌。旅大玻璃厂生产了一种套料玻璃杯，透明美观、艺术性强，南京玻璃厂为了学会生产这种玻璃杯的技术，特地从在广州举行的展览会上买回了样品，仔细加以研究，并且专门组织一个小组到旅大学习，回来以后，排出八项追赶指标，一项项学习、一项项赶，现在在套色、杯型、应力方面已掌握了老大哥厂的本领。正确电池厂在提高南京牌电池质量时，上海汇明电池厂还特别派人来帮助，给了他们很大支援。
    一支新军突起
    随着城市人民公社化运动高潮的到来，社办工业的队伍正在成长。这支新军的突起，使日用工业品生产战线的阵容大大加强了。
    那是今年4、5月间的事情，各地区先后建立了城市人民公社，全面地组织了经济生活，办起了工厂、办起了食堂、托儿所。许多家庭妇女走出了厨房走进了工厂，许多过去只是消费日用品的人，现在变成了生产日用品的积极分子。下关人民公社三汊河地区有七十多个家庭妇女，她们过去有的是船民家属，有的是街道居民，以往，她们每次到百货商店去，总喜欢选购那柔软的毛巾啦、手套啦等等日用品，但却从来不知道这些东西是怎么生产出来的。自从她们七十多个人办起了棉织厂以后，只不过个把月时间，就学会了织毛巾、织手套的技术，而且还和老大哥厂——南京毛巾厂挂钩竞赛，使自己厂里出的大路货毛巾的质量，达到全市棉织业的先进水平。她们在办厂以前，如果以每户一年用两条毛巾算，一年要用毛巾一百四十多条，而自从办起了工厂到现在的二十多个月中，她们已生产了近三十万条毛巾，足够供应全市每户一条了。所以这个厂的厂长方光顺逢人总要兴奋地介绍说：“我们这个厂呀，是总路线照出来的，大跃进跃出来的，人民公社办起来的！”
    人民公社的建立，不仅使许多从未生产过日用工业品的人，成为日用工业品生产战线的新军，同时，也使许多过去是典型的消费地区，变成了生产日用工业品的地区了。夫子庙，这是旧社会南京市内的著名消费地区，街道上，全是酒馆、茶社、杂耍场。解放以后到1958年以前，这个地区经过了改造，面貌起了很大的变化。但当时，仍然是没有一个工厂。1958年大跃进中，这里办起了七家工厂，今年4月，这个地区建立了人民公社的分社，一下子办起了三十多家工厂，其中有十三个厂七百五十一个人是专门生产日用工业品的。许多地区建立了人民公社以后，办起的社办工厂，已经承担了小商品的生产任务。建邺人民公社升州路分社成立以前，这个地区的发夹、铁包锁、响器等日用小五金产品，都是由区属的先锋五金厂、建邺电机厂制造的，自从升州路分社建立、办起了社办五金厂以后，不仅这些产品全部下放到了社办工厂里，而且生产的品种还比过去增加了一点二倍之多。
