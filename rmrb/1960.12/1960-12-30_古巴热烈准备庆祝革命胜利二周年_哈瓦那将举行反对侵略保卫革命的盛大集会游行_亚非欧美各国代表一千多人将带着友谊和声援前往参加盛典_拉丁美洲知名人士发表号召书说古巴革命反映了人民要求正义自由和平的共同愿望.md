Xinhua News Agency, Havana, December 28th. A committee composed of all major political organizations and people's groups in Cuba is intensifying preparations for the celebration of the second anniversary of the revolution's victory.

　　The solemn and enthusiastic celebrations will begin on December 30th, culminating in a large-scale armed parade against aggression and to defend the revolution on January 2nd in Havana's Civic Square. On January 2nd, rebel army troops and 100,000 militiamen will parade with various new weapons; people from all walks of life in Cuba will once again express their unwavering determination to oppose American aggression and defend the revolution at a grand rally held that day.

　　The Cuban Association for Friendship with All Peoples announced that it has invited more than a thousand guests from around the world to participate in the celebrations for the second anniversary of the revolution's victory. Distinguished guests from some Latin American countries and the United States, as well as a Japanese delegation, have already arrived in Havana. Delegations from socialist countries such as the Soviet Union and China, representatives from distant African countries such as Congo, Ghana, Cameroon, Kenya, and Togo, as well as distinguished guests from other Latin American and European countries and a delegation from the World Peace Council will arrive here successively. These foreign guests will bring the friendly feelings of the people from every corner of the world to the Cuban people and their solidarity with the Cuban revolution.

　　1961 will be Cuba's Year of Education. Prime Minister Castro and all the foreign guests will join ten thousand volunteer teachers in a grand celebration at Havana's Freedom City on December 31st to welcome the start of the Year of Education.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, December 28th. Cuban Foreign Minister Raúl Roa delivered a speech on television last night on the position of the Cuban delegation in the United Nations General Assembly.

　　When discussing the Congo issue, he revealed that the United States, under the guise of aiding Congo, was massively invading all aspects of Congo's economic and financial structure. He demanded the restoration of Congo's constitutional order and the recognition of the Lumumba regime, which represents the Congolese people.

　　When discussing the issue of China's representation in the United Nations, Roa pointed out that "China's representation is today being usurped by a puppet manipulated by American imperialism." He emphasized, "Cuba advocates that China's representation belongs to the People's Republic of China. This is not only because China is one of the most expansive countries in the world, but also because she is a peace-loving country representing six hundred million people on Earth. It is impossible to discuss world peace without the People's Republic of China expressing its views."

　　When discussing the Cuban delegation's support for the Algerian people's position in the United Nations, Roa said that the Algerian people's struggle "is not only to gain political power, but also to establish a new way of life, which will have a significant impact on the entire North Africa and will be a bulwark against imperialism attempting to dominate there."

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, December 28th. Former Mexican President General Lázaro Cárdenas and some Latin American luminaries have called for a Latin American conference for national sovereignty, economic liberation, and peace to be held in Mexico City early next year.

　　Cuban capital newspapers today published Cárdenas' and others' call for the aforementioned conference to Latin American patriotic, democratic, and peace-loving people.

　　The appeal pointed out that striving for freedom and democratic rights, defending sovereignty, promoting economic independence and development, and satisfying aspirations for education and culture are all inextricably linked to the Latin American people.

　　The appeal said that the Latin American people "do not want to continue living in poverty, ignorance, and unsanitary conditions. They refuse to acknowledge that the situation of dependence on foreign countries, being plundered by foreign countries, and the large-scale use of violence is destined." The appeal said, "The legitimate desire of the peoples of (Latin American) countries to decide their own destiny cannot be fully realized in the current circumstances of our countries, because answering their most pressing desires is a policy that restricts the exercise of sovereignty, restricts freedom, violates rights, undermines economic liberation, stifles the expression of national culture, uses large amounts of funds for military expenditures, and isolates our countries from each other and from the rest of the world." The appeal emphasized that "the Cuban people's great revolutionary movement most purely reflects the common aspirations of 200 million Latin American people for justice, freedom, and peace. Therefore, Cuba and the Cuban revolutionary government have received the warmest support from the people and the strongest and most spontaneous solidarity movement on the continent and around the world." The appeal said, "Today, every Latin American understands that defending Cuba is defending Latin America. Today, every Latin American understands that the continued aggression against Cuba, or the violation of the airspace, territory, and territorial waters of any one of us, is a violation of the national sovereignty of our peoples, the security of the Americas, and world peace."

    亚非欧美各国代表一千多人将带着友谊和声援前往参加盛典
    拉丁美洲知名人士发表号召书说古巴革命反映了人民要求正义自由和平的共同愿望
    新华社哈瓦那28日电　由古巴所有重要政治组织和人民团体组成的一个委员会正在加紧进行庆祝革命胜利二周年的准备工作。
    隆重和热烈的庆祝活动将从12月30日开始，而以明年1月2日在首都西维卡广场举行的反对侵略、保卫革命的大规模武装游行达到高潮。1月2日那天，起义军部队和十万民兵将携带各种新式武器列队游行；古巴各阶层人民将在当天举行的盛大集会上再次表示他们反对美国侵略、保卫革命的坚定不移的决心。
    古巴和各国人民友好协会宣布，已经邀请世界各国的一千多位来宾参加革命胜利二周年的庆祝活动。来自拉丁美洲一些国家和美国的贵宾以及日本代表团已经到达哈瓦那。将陆续来到这里的还有苏联、中国等社会主义国家的代表团，刚果、加纳、喀麦隆、怯尼亚、多哥等遥远的非洲国家的代表以及另外一些拉丁美洲国家和欧洲国家的贵宾以及世界和平理事会的代表团。这些外宾将带来世界各个角落的人民对古巴人民的友好情谊和对古巴革命的声援。
    1961年将是古巴的教育年。卡斯特罗总理和全体外宾将于12月31日在哈瓦那自由城同一万名志愿教师一起举行盛大的庆祝会，迎接教育年的开始。
    新华社哈瓦那28日电　古巴外交部长劳尔·罗亚昨晚在电视节目中就古巴代表团在联合国大会中的立场发表演说。
    他在谈到刚果问题时揭露美国在援助刚果的外衣下大举侵入刚果的经济和金融结构的各个方面。他要求恢复刚果的宪法秩序和承认代表刚果人民的卢蒙巴政权。
    罗亚在谈到中国在联合国的代表权问题时指出，“中国的代表权今天被美帝国主义所操纵的一个傀儡窃据着”。他强调指出，“古巴主张中国的代表权属于中华人民共和国。这不仅是由于中国是世界上幅员最广阔的国家之一，而且还因为她是一个代表着地球上六亿人口的爱好和平的国家。没有中华人民共和国发表意见是不可能讨论世界和平问题的。”
    罗亚在谈到古巴代表团在联合国支持阿尔及利亚人民的立场时说，阿尔及利亚人民的斗争“不仅是为了取得政权，而且是为了建立一种新的生活方式，这种生活方式将对整个北非产生重大的意义，并且将是对付企图统治那里的帝国主义的堡垒”。
    新华社哈瓦那28日电　墨西哥前总统拉萨罗·卡德纳斯将军和拉丁美洲一些知名人士，号召明年初在墨西哥城举行拉丁美洲争取国家主权、经济解放和和平会议。
    古巴首都报纸今天刊登了卡德纳斯等为召开上述会议给拉丁美洲爱国、民主和和平人士的号召书。
    号召书指出，争取自由和民主权利，保卫主权以及促进经济独立和发展，满足关于教育和文化的渴望，这一切是同拉丁美洲人民休戚相关的。
    号召书说，拉丁美洲人民“不想在贫困、无知和不卫生的情况下继续生活下去。他们拒绝承认依附外国、受外国掠夺和大规模使用暴力的局势是命中注定的。”号召书说，“（拉丁美洲）各国人民决定自己命运的正当愿望在我们各国目前的情况下不可能得到充分的实现，因为回答他们最切身的愿望的是这样一种政策——它限制主权的行使，限制自由，侵犯权利和破坏经济解放，窒息民族文化的表现，把大量资金用于军费，使我们各国人民彼此隔绝，并同世界其他各地隔绝。”号召书强调指出，“最纯正地反映两亿拉丁美洲人民要求正义、自由和和平的共同愿望的是古巴人民巨大的革命运动。因此，古巴和古巴革命政府得到了人民最热烈的支持，得到了大陆上和全世界最强大的和自发的声援运动的支持”。号召书说：“今天每一个拉丁美洲人都懂得，保卫古巴就是保卫拉丁美洲，今天每一个拉丁美洲人都懂得，无论是对古巴继续不断的侵略，还是对我们当中任何一个国家领空、领土和领海的侵犯都是对我们各国人民的民族主权、美洲的安全和世界和平的侵犯。”
