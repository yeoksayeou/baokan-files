    Hungarian Agricultural Science Serving Production

    Hungarian agricultural scientific research is developing rapidly.

    Serving production is the characteristic of Hungarian agricultural scientific research and the reason for its rapid development.

    Vigorously Train Agricultural Technical Cadres

    The Hungarian Party and government are very concerned about and attach great importance to agricultural scientific research. The state spends 100 million forints (Hungarian currency) annually to promote agricultural scientific research and cultivate talents.

    Hungary has made great achievements in training agricultural scientific and technical cadres. At present, there are seven higher agricultural colleges specializing in training agricultural scientific and technical personnel, with about 5,000 students. In addition, there are four-year secondary agricultural technical schools and two- or three-year junior training courses.

    In order to popularize agricultural scientific knowledge, the Hungarian Party and government make extensive use of the winter slack season to hold agricultural lectures and demonstration studies. These learning networks are distributed in every village, so that the majority of farmers have the opportunity to learn and apply scientific knowledge widely to production.

    Conduct Research in Combination with Production

    Agricultural scientific research institutions have also developed substantially. Before World War II, there were only five agricultural science research institutes and seven experimental stations in the country, with only 150 agricultural science researchers. At present, agricultural science research institutions have spread throughout the country, and the number of researchers has increased more than tenfold.

    At present, Hungarian agricultural scientific research is divided into two types: national and local. National research institutions are established according to production departments, such as the Large Livestock Research Institute, the Small Livestock Research Institute, and the Variety Experiment Research Institute. There are also institutions specializing in the study of irrigation and rice, horticulture, plant protection, variety improvement, viticulture, spice plants, fish farming, mechanization, afforestation, wheat and flour, agricultural chemistry, and veterinary medicine.

    The primary task of local research institutions is to help various regions solve production problems, and they also participate in the work of national research institutes.

    In order to combine theory with practice, each research institution has its own experimental farm. The main tasks of these farms are to provide conditions for research work, to adopt the results of research work on a large scale, and to promote improved seeds and purebred livestock. The corn seeds produced by these farms are popular with state-owned farms, agricultural production cooperatives, and the majority of farmers.

    The experimental farms adopt the latest achievements in science and technology to demonstrate new farming methods to agricultural cooperatives, and at the same time convince individual farmers of the superiority of large-scale farming. Experimental farms also frequently exchange production experiences with state-owned farms and agricultural cooperatives.

    In addition to the above tasks, experimental farms are also large-scale production units in various agricultural areas, making contributions to increasing agricultural output.

      Scientific Achievements Promote Agricultural Production

    The work of Hungarian agricultural scientific research institutions is carried out according to the needs of the national economy, and the results of scientific research have promoted the development of agricultural production. At present, various research institutions are studying 350 agricultural scientific problems, and research on some of these problems has achieved significant results.

    Since Hungary has a large area of ​​alkaline sandy land with very low fertility, vigorously improving the soil has become an important task for developing agriculture. Scientist Egeszegi Sándor has developed a method to increase land fertility. This method is to apply ordinary fertilizer, green manure, or peat in three layers to the sandy soil, at a depth of 40 to 60 centimeters, with one-third placed at the bottom layer (45 to 60 centimeters deep), deep plowing 40 to 50 centimeters in the second year, and then applying fertilizer. The last one-third is placed at a depth of 25 to 30 centimeters. Each time chemical fertilizer is applied, the sandy soil must be compacted to avoid excessive oxidation. This measure of deep plowing and fertilization is of great significance for increasing the yield per unit area of ​​alkaline land.

    In the production of hybrid corn and improved sugar beets, the achievements of Hungarian scientific research have been praised abroad. Scientists have cultivated four standard hybrid corn varieties, namely Martonvásár No. 1, No. 5, No. 39, and No. 40, which have become world-renowned varieties.

    In the past decade, Hungarian agricultural scientists have provided about 150 improved plant varieties for agricultural production. The improved beet varieties they have developed have been produced on a large scale, and these varieties have increased sugar production by 8% to 10% compared with previous varieties. The yield of new peach tree varieties has doubled compared with the original varieties.

    In animal husbandry, the reproduction of cattle has increased and feeding costs have been reduced due to the implementation of several research results. Better experience has also been gained in pig and poultry farming. Factories have produced many antibiotics for livestock. According to scientific research results, crossbreeding Soviet Caucasian sheep with local Hungarian sheep has almost doubled the average wool yield. (Gyula) (Attached picture)

    为生产服务的匈牙利农业科学
    匈牙利的农业科学研究工作正在迅速发展着。
    为生产服务，这是匈牙利农业科学研究工作的特点，也是这项事业能够迅速发展的原因。
    大力培养农业技术干部
    匈牙利的党和政府十分关怀和重视农业科学研究工作。国家每年用于促进农业科学研究和培养人材的经费达一亿福林（匈币）。
    在培养农业科学技术干部方面，匈牙利已获得巨大的成就。目前全国有专门培养农业科学技术人员的高等农业院校七所，学生五千名左右。此外还有四年制的中级农业技术学校和二、三年制的初级训练班。
    为了普及农业科学知识，匈牙利党和政府利用冬季农闲期间大量举办农业讲座和示范学习。这些学习网分布在每个村庄，使广大农民都获得学习机会，把科学知识广泛地运用到生产上。
    结合生产进行研究工作
    农业科学研究机构也有了大量的发展。在第二次世界大战前，全国只有五个农业科学研究所和七个实验站，农业科学研究人员只有一百五十人。目前，农业科学研究机构已遍布全国，研究人员则增加了十几倍。
    目前匈牙利农业科学研究分为全国性的和地方性的两种。全国性的研究机构按照生产部门设立，例如大家畜研究所、小家畜研究所、品种实验研究所等，还有专门研究灌溉和水稻、园艺、植物保护、品种改良、葡萄栽培、香料植物、养鱼、机械化、造林、小麦及面粉、农业化学和兽医等问题的机构。
    地方性的研究机构首要任务是帮助各地解决生产上的问题，同时也参加全国性研究所的工作。
    为了使理论结合实践，各研究机构都有自己的实验农场。这些农场的主要任务是为研究工作提供条件，大规模地采用研究工作的成果，推广改良种子和纯种牲畜。这些农场生产的玉米种子受到国营农场、农业生产合作社和广大农民的欢迎。
    实验农场采用科学技术的最新成果，为农业社示范新式耕种法，同时使个体农民相信大规模耕种的优越性。实验农场也经常同国营农场和农业社交流生产经验。
    除了以上的任务外，实验农场也是各农业区的大规模生产单位，在增加农业产量方面作出了贡献。
      科学成果推动农业生产
    匈牙利农业科学研究机构的工作是按照国民经济的需要进行的，科学研究的成果促进了农业生产的发展。目前，各研究机构正在研究三百五十项农业科学问题，其中一些问题的研究工作已获得显著的成效。
    由于匈牙利有着大面积的含碱沙地，肥力很低，大力改良土壤就成为发展农业的重要任务。科学家埃格舍吉·山道尔已经研究出一种提高土地肥力的办法。这种方法是：用普通肥料、绿肥或泥炭分三层施于沙土中，深度为四十至六十公分，其中三分之一置于底层（四十五至六十公分深处），第二年深耕四十至五十公分，然后施肥。最后的三分之一放在二十五至三十公分深处。每次施化肥，必须把沙土压紧以免氧化过度。这种深耕和施肥并举的措施，对于提高含碱地单位面积产量有很大的作用。
    在生产杂交玉米和改良糖萝卜方面，匈牙利科学研究的成果已经受到国外的赞扬。科学家已经培育出四种标准杂交玉米品种，即马尔东瓦夏尔一号、五号、三十九号和四十号，它们已成为世界优良的品种。
    在过去十年中，匈牙利农业科学人员已经为农业生产提供了约一百五十种改良植物品种。他们改良的甜菜品种已经大规模生产，这些品种产糖量比过去的品种提高8％到10％。新品种的桃树产桃量比原有的增加了一倍。
    在畜牧业方面，由于实施了几项研究结果，牛的繁殖已增加了，饲养费用也减少了。猪和家禽的饲养方面也获得了较好的经验。各工厂生产了许多供牲畜用的抗生素。根据科学研究结果，苏联高加索的羊同匈牙利本地羊杂交，平均产毛量几乎增加了一倍。　（居拉）（附图片）
