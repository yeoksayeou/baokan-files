    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang: According to reports in the local newspapers, thanks to the smooth progress of the mass technological innovation movement, the daily output of heavy-duty trucks and tractors in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has been steadily increasing recently. Currently, the average daily production is 16.7 heavy-duty trucks and 24 tractors.

    The Tokchon Automobile Factory, which produces heavy-duty trucks, produced a total of 500 heavy-duty trucks in November, exceeding the plan by 170 vehicles, and increasing by 278 vehicles compared to October, more than doubling the output. This achievement is due to the fact that more than 80 shock brigades and work teams in the factory recently responded to the call issued by the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party at its plenary session in August this year to launch a broad mass technological innovation movement. They adopted more than 1,200 inventions and rationalization proposals in production, and manufactured more than 2,800 types of tools and fixtures themselves, increasing the processing capacity of heavy-duty truck parts by two to four times compared to last year, and greatly shortening the man-hours required to manufacture each heavy-duty truck in November compared to October.

    The Kiyang Tractor Factory also achieved great results. In November, the factory processed parts for 600 tractors and assembled 518 tractors, setting the highest monthly production record since the factory started producing tractors.

    In November, the factory's workers mechanized and automated more than 100 large and small labor processes. In addition, they launched a high-speed cutting campaign, increasing the cutting speed in November by another 20% to 40% compared to October. Now, the factory can assemble a tractor every sixty minutes. The factory's workers have also proposed to produce 4,500 tractors for the rural areas before the spring plowing next year.

    朝鲜汽车拖拉机产量节节上升
    平均每天生产16.7辆汽车和24台拖拉机
    新华社平壤电　据这里的报纸报道，由于群众性的技术革新运动的顺利展开，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的载重汽车和拖拉机的日产量最近节节上升，目前平均每天能够生产十六点七辆载重汽车和二十四台拖拉机。
    生产载重汽车的德川汽车工厂在11月份共生产了五百辆载重汽车，比计划多生产了一百七十辆，比10月份多生产了二百七十八辆，即增加了一倍多。这个成绩的取得是由于这个工厂的八十多个突击队和作业班的工人们近来响应朝鲜劳动党中央委员会今年八月全会发出的广泛展开群众性技术革新运动的号召的结果。他们在生产中采用了一千二百多件创造发明和合理化建议，自己制造了二千八百多种工具和卡具，使载重汽车零件的加工能力比去年提高了二倍到四倍，使11月份制造每辆载重汽车所需要的工时比10月份大大缩短了。
    岐阳拖拉机厂的成绩也很大。这个厂在11月份加工了六百台拖拉机的零件，并装配了五百一十八台拖拉机，创造了这个工厂生产拖拉机以来最高的月产量纪录。
    这个工厂的工人们在11月份内把大小一百多项劳动过程机械化、自动化了；另外还展开了高速切削运动，使11月份的切削速度比10月份又提高了20％到40％。现在这个工厂每六十分钟就能装配好一台拖拉机。这个工厂的工人们还提出，在明年春耕以前，要为农村生产四千五百台拖拉机。
