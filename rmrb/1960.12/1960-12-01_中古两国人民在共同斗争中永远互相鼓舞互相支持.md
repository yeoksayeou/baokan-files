The Cuban Revolutionary Government Economic Delegation headed by Major Ernesto "Che" Guevara, President of the National Bank of Cuba, concludes its friendly visit to China today. During the visit, Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, received Major Guevara and all members of the delegation. Chinese national leaders also held sincere and friendly talks with Major Guevara. The joint communiqué issued by Chinese Vice Premier of the State Council Li Xiannian and the head of the Cuban Revolutionary Government Economic Delegation, Major Ernesto "Che" Guevara, after the talks, indicated that both sides reached unanimous views on the current international situation, the situation in Latin America, the situation in Cuba, and the further development of friendly and cooperative relations between China and Cuba. China and Cuba also concluded an economic cooperation agreement, and signed the 1961 trade protocol and the scientific and technological cooperation protocol. The Chinese people regard the visit of the Cuban Revolutionary Government Economic Delegation as a milestone in the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Cuba, and highly appreciate the contributions made by Major Guevara and other distinguished Cuban guests to further consolidate and develop the friendship between the peoples of China and Cuba.

The consensus reached between China and Cuba on the current international situation and major issues of common concern once again proves that the profound friendship between the peoples of China and Cuba is built on the common foundation of opposing imperialism, safeguarding world peace, maintaining national independence, and striving for social progress. The people of China and Cuba are comrades in need. Our friendship is established in the common struggle against U.S. imperialism. We have both suffered from U.S. imperialist aggression and oppression for a long time. After achieving revolutionary victory through arduous struggles, we have continued to be threatened and invaded by U.S. imperialism. We face a common enemy. U.S. imperialism still occupies China's territory of Taiwan and is entrenched in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba; U.S. imperialism is constantly carrying out military provocations and war threats against us; U.S. imperialism has never given up its ambition to strangle the Chinese and Cuban revolutions. The U.S. imperialist Seventh Fleet frequently maintains its preparation for aggression against China in the Taiwan Strait, and recently has deployed troops in the Caribbean Sea to step up its planning for a public armed attack on Cuba. Therefore, we deeply recognize that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the peoples of China and Cuba and of world peace. Its sinful policy of aggression and enslavement against China and Cuba, although repeatedly met with shameful failure, has never and will never lay down its butcher knife and will continue to make trouble. U.S. imperialism, this negative teacher, has taught the people of our two countries that the nature of imperialism will never change, and that people must never harbor any illusions about the most ferocious and cunning U.S. imperialism.

The Chinese people have always admired the heroism of the Cuban people in their struggle to defend the revolution and oppose U.S. intervention, and have been encouraged and supported by the Cuban people's resolute struggle. The consolidation and development of the Cuban revolution has powerfully shattered the so-called "geographical determinism" that countries near the United States and under its strict control cannot achieve people's revolutionary victory, thereby greatly encouraging the struggle of all oppressed nations in Latin America and other regions for national liberation and people's democracy. Although U.S. imperialism is nearby, baring its fangs and brandishing its claws, the seemingly powerful U.S. imperialism is nothing more than a paper tiger in front of the Cuban people because the Cuban people are united, mobilized, and armed, and are waiting in full battle array, or as the Cuban people say, nothing more than "an eagle with plucked feathers."

At the same time, the Cuban people are not intimidated by U.S. economic pressure, and are determined to rely on their own efforts to break through the U.S. economic blockade and embark on the road of independent economic development. The heroic Cuban people have shattered the myth that underdeveloped countries cannot develop their economies without U.S. "aid" after gaining independence. Now, the Cuban people are actively responding to Castro's call to "defend themselves with their own production plans" and are waging a resolute struggle against the U.S. economic blockade.

In this regard, the Chinese people also have personal experience. After our revolutionary victory, imperialism, headed by the United States, attempted to subdue us with blockades and embargoes. However, the U.S. blockade and embargo did not harm us. On the contrary, it made us more determined to rely on the strength of our own people to get rid of China's semi-colonial economic dependence and shortened the process of our achieving complete economic independence and autonomy. We adhere to the principle of self-reliance, and with the support of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, we rely on our own strength to overcome all difficulties and carry out our socialist construction at high speed, thereby enabling our national economy to achieve tremendous development. There is no doubt that the Cuban people will also be able to thwart the U.S. imperialist despicable conspiracy to strangle the Cuban revolution by means of an economic blockade, with the support of socialist countries and all peace-loving countries.

In July of this year, when U.S. imperialism reduced Cuba's sugar import quota, we signed a trade and payment agreement with Cuba to develop trade with Cuba on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. The governments of the two countries also concluded an economic cooperation agreement during this meeting. According to this agreement, the Chinese side will provide the Republic of Cuba with an interest-free loan of 240 million rubles from 1961 to 1965 to provide complete sets of equipment and technical assistance to help Cuba develop its economy. The governments of China and Cuba also signed the 1961 trade protocol and the scientific and technological cooperation protocol respectively, in accordance with the trade and payment agreement and the scientific and technological cooperation agreement signed in July this year. These agreements and protocols stipulate that the Chinese government will purchase one million tons of Cuban sugar and other Cuban export commodities in 1961, and will help Cuba train technicians, fully embodying the principles of equality and mutual benefit and the spirit of friendly cooperation in Sino-Cuban relations, and conducive to the common high tide of economic and cultural development in the two countries. This is a concrete manifestation of the combat friendship between the peoples of China and Cuba in supporting and assisting each other in the common struggle against U.S. imperialism.

The Chinese people cherish the deep friendship of the Cuban people very much. Regardless of U.S. intimidation, the Cuban people have established diplomatic relations with our country. The Cuban Revolutionary Government Economic Delegation, headed by Major Guevara, personally brought the deep and sincere friendship of the Cuban people. During their visit to China, they saw with their own eyes that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government, inspired by the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, our people are making unremitting efforts to build their great socialist motherland, and were deeply impressed by the great achievements our people have made in socialist construction and the firm stance taken in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism and in defense of world peace. The Cuban delegation also reiterated its full support for the Chinese people's just struggle to liberate their territory of Taiwan. Our people express their heartfelt thanks for the deep friendship of the Cuban people conveyed by the Cuban delegation. As Major Guevara said at the rally of people from all walks of life in our capital to welcome the Cuban Revolutionary Government Economic Delegation: "Precisely because our enemies are common, our enemies hate us; precisely because we all have a common desire for a better world, our friendship will last forever like the white snow of the Himalayas."

We fully agree with the final point made in the joint communiqué: "The consolidation and development of the friendship between the peoples of China and Cuba not only conforms to the vital interests of the two peoples, but also helps to promote the friendship between China and the peoples of Latin American countries, and helps to safeguard the common cause of world peace." The Chinese people will always stand with the Cuban people, encourage each other, support each other, and fight to the end against U.S. imperialist aggression and intervention and for the maintenance of world peace.

### 中古两国人民在共同斗争中永远互相鼓舞互相支持

    中古两国人民在共同斗争中永远互相鼓舞互相支持
    以古巴国家银行行长埃尔内斯托·切·格瓦拉少校为首的古巴革命政府经济代表团，今天结束了在中国的友好访问。在访问期间，中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东同志接见了格瓦拉少校和代表团全体团员。我国国家领导人并同格瓦拉少校进行了诚挚友好的会谈。会谈后我国国务院副总理李先念和古巴革命政府经济代表团团长埃尔内斯托·切·格瓦拉少校发表的联合公报表明，双方就当前国际形势、拉丁美洲地区形势、古巴形势和进一步发展中古两国友好合作关系等问题取得了一致的看法。中古两国还缔结了经济合作协定，签订了1961年贸易议定书以及科学和技术合作议定书。中国人民把古巴革命政府经济代表团的来访看作是中古两国友好合作关系的里程碑，并对格瓦拉少校和其他古巴贵宾对于进一步巩固和发展中古两国人民友谊所作出的贡献给予极高的评价。
    中古双方对于当前的国际形势和两国共同关心的重大问题取得一致看法，再一次证明中古两国人民之间的深厚的友谊是建立在反对帝国主义、保卫世界和平、维护民族独立和争取社会进步的共同基础上的。中国人民和古巴人民是患难之交。我们之间的友谊是在反对美帝国主义的共同斗争中建立起来的。我们都曾长期遭受美帝国主义的侵略和压迫，我们经过艰巨的斗争取得了革命胜利以后，同样一直受到美帝国主义的威胁和侵略。我们面对着共同的敌人。美帝国主义至今霸占着中国的领土台湾，也盘踞着古巴的关塔那摩基地；美帝国主义不断对我们进行着军事挑衅和战争威胁；美帝国主义从来没有放弃绞杀中国革命和古巴革命的野心。美帝国主义的第七舰队在台湾海峡经常保持侵略中国的准备，最近又陈兵加勒比海加紧策划对古巴发动公开的武装进攻。因此，我们深切地认识到美帝国主义是中古两国人民和世界和平最凶恶的敌人。它侵略和奴役中国和古巴的罪恶政策，虽则一再遭到可耻的失败，但是，绝没有也决不会放下屠刀，还要继续捣乱。美帝国主义这个反面教员教育了我们两国人民：帝国主义的本性是永远不会改变的，人们绝不能对最凶恶、最狡猾的美帝国主义存有任何幻想。
    中国人民对于古巴人民在保卫革命和反对美国干涉的斗争中所表现的英雄气概一向无限敬佩，并且从古巴人民的坚决斗争中得到鼓舞和支持。古巴革命的巩固和发展，有力地粉碎了那种所谓靠近美国和受美国严密控制的国家不能够取得人民革命胜利的“地理宿命论”，从而大大鼓舞了拉丁美洲以及其他地区一切被压迫民族争取民族解放和人民民主的斗争。尽管美帝国主义近在咫尺，张牙舞爪，但是由于古巴人民团结起来，动员起来，而且武装起来，严阵以待，貌似强大的美帝国主义在古巴人民面前就不过是一只纸老虎，或者像古巴人民所说的，不过“是一只羽毛脱落的老鹰”而已。
    同时，古巴人民丝毫不为美国的经济压力所吓倒，决心自力更生，冲破美国的经济封锁，走上经济独立发展的道路。英勇的古巴人民粉碎了所谓不发达的国家取得独立以后不靠美国的“援助”就无法发展自己的经济的神话。现在，古巴人民正在积极响应卡斯特罗的号召，“用自己的生产计划来自卫”，同美帝国主义的经济封锁进行坚决的斗争。
    在这方面，中国人民也有切身的经验。我们革命胜利以后，以美国为首的帝国主义曾经企图用封锁禁运来压服我们。但是美国的封锁禁运并没有能够损害我们，相反地，却使我们更加坚定地依靠人民自己的力量，来摆脱中国经济的半殖民地依赖性，缩短了我们在经济上获得完全独立自主的过程。我们坚持以自力更生为主的方针，在以苏联为首的社会主义国家的支援下，依靠我们自己的力量，排除万难，高速度地进行我们的社会主义建设，从而使我们的国民经济获得巨大的发展。毫无疑问，古巴人民也一定能够在社会主义各国和所有爱好和平国家的支援下，粉碎美帝国主义企图用经济封锁的办法来扼杀古巴革命的卑鄙阴谋。
    今年7月间，当美帝国主义削减古巴食糖进口定额的时候，我们曾同古巴签订了贸易和支付协定，在平等互利的基础上发展同古巴的贸易。两国政府在这次会谈中又缔结了经济合作协定。根据这个协定，中国方面将于1961年到1965年内给予古巴共和国二亿四千万卢布的无息贷款，用于提供成套设备和技术援助以帮助古巴发展经济。中古两国政府还根据今年7月签订的贸易和支付协定以及科学和技术合作协定，分别签订了1961年贸易议定书和科学和技术合作议定书。这些协定和议定书规定了中国政府将于1961年内购买古巴糖一百万吨和其他古巴出口商品，将帮助古巴训练技术人员，充分体现了中古两国关系中的平等互利原则和友好合作精神，并且有利于两国经济文化的共同高涨。这正是中古两国人民在反对美帝国主义共同斗争中互相支持、互相援助的战斗友谊的具体表现。
    中国人民十分珍视古巴人民的深情厚谊。古巴人民不顾美国的威吓，已经同我国建立了外交关系。以格瓦拉少校为首的古巴革命政府经济代表团又亲自带来了古巴人民深切的、真挚的友谊。他们在中国访问期间，亲眼看到了我国人民在中国共产党和中国政府的领导下，在总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面红旗的鼓舞下，为建设自己伟大的社会主义祖国进行着坚毅的努力，并对我国人民在社会主义建设中所取得的伟大成就以及在反对帝国主义和殖民主义、保卫世界和平的斗争中所采取的坚定立场，留下深刻的印象。古巴代表团还重申了完全支持中国人民解放自己的领土台湾的正义斗争。我国人民对于古巴代表团所转达的古巴人民的深情厚谊，表示衷心的感谢。正如格瓦拉少校在我国首都各界人民欢迎古巴革命政府经济代表团大会上所说的：“正是因为我们的敌人是共同的，我们的敌人都仇恨我们；正是因为我们都对一个更美好的世界怀着共同的愿望，我们的友谊将像喜马拉雅山的白雪一样永世长存。”
    我们完全同意联合公报中最后所指出的：“中国古巴两国人民友谊的巩固和发展，不仅符合两国人民的切身利益，而且有助于促进中国同拉丁美洲各国人民之间的友谊，有助于维护世界和平的共同事业。”中国人民将永远同古巴人民一道，互相鼓舞，互相支持，为反对美帝国主义的侵略和干涉，为维护世界和平而斗争到底。
