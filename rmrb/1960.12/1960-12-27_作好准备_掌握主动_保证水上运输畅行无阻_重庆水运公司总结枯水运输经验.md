Make Good Preparations, Seize the Initiative, and Ensure Smooth Water Transport
Chongqing Shipping Company Summarizes Experience in Dry Season Transportation

    (Our report) Chongqing City Water Transport Company mobilized its workers to comprehensively summarize and apply the experience of overcoming the dry season last winter and this spring, in order to make good preparations for overcoming the dry season this winter and next spring.
    Last winter and this spring, the Yangtze River and Jialing River in Chongqing City encountered an unprecedented severe dry season, with numerous shoals, shallow water, narrow channels, and exposed reefs, bringing a series of difficulties to water transport. In order to overcome the dry season, the company's workers overcame various difficulties and created many experiences, achieving a high-yield victory in dry season transportation. In order to fully utilize the experience of overcoming the dry season last winter and this spring, the company party committee analyzed the situation of industrial and agricultural production and freight volume growth in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year before the flood receded, and compared the current water level decline with the same period last year. On the one hand, they strengthened ideological education for employees, making them fully aware of the important position of water transportation and the various favorable conditions for overcoming the dry season. At the same time, they took a series of specific measures in terms of equipment, labor, and organizational leadership, and organized special personnel to investigate changes in the riverbed.
    Reforming ship types was an important experience in overcoming the dry season last year. Based on the river conditions in the city, they summarized the rich experience of ship type reform in the past two years. After repeated research and comparison, they selected the upright pontoon, which has shallow draft, large load capacity, fast speed, and is suitable for dry season navigation, as a superior ship type among the various excellent ship types that have been rebuilt in the past, and newly rebuilt a large number of upright pontoon ships. Jialing River Station, which bears the heavy task of coal and coke transportation, had 30% of its ships converted to pontoons by November, greatly increasing transportation capacity. This type of ship generally increases the carrying capacity by 30% without increasing the draft depth, creating favorable conditions for realizing "large ships do not reduce load, and small ships overload more" in the dry season. Through ship type reform, the company increased its transportation capacity by about 30% of the total tonnage of ships, which is fifteen times more than the tonnage of new wooden ships built this year, adding a large amount of transportation capacity to the country. In order to ensure the safety and high yield of ships in the dry season, in addition to vigorously carrying out ship type reform, they also overhauled the original shallow water tugboats and some ships. The Jialing River Station also comprehensively inspected the tonnage, quality, and tool equipment of ships, making full preparations for overcoming the dry season and winning high yields.
    Last year, due to insufficient estimation of the dry season situation and inadequate equipment preparation, more than 800 laborers had to be scattered on various dangerous beaches to pull the ships, which not only affected transportation efficiency but also occupied a lot of labor. In order to learn from this experience, they vigorously carried out technical innovation for the beach pulling work. Before the arrival of the dry season, they conducted detailed research and planning on the beach pulling machinery of various dangerous beaches in the Jialing River, and adopted the method of self-reliance and a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to manufacture six beach winch machines. On the Hongshaqi dangerous beach, where the water level has returned to the channel, the beach winch machine has been firmly erected on the beach. The remaining beach winch machines can be installed immediately when the water level returns to the channel. Each beach winch machine can replace more than 100 people pulling the beach, and can greatly improve transportation efficiency.
    Dredging waterways is an important link to ensure smooth water transport and increase transport volume during the dry season. In the past few years, great achievements have been made in dredging the Jialing River waterway. Based on the experience of overcoming the dry season last year, this year's waterway dredging work started particularly early. By the end of November, the dam construction project had been completed by about 50%, and the dredging and blasting of reefs was also being accelerated according to the decline of the water level.

    作好准备　掌握主动　保证水上运输畅行无阻
    重庆水运公司总结枯水运输经验
    本报讯　重庆市水上运输公司发动职工全面总结和运用去冬今春战胜枯水的经验，为战胜今冬明春的枯水作好各项准备工作。
    去冬今春，重庆市长江和嘉陵江遇到了二十三年来从未有过的特大枯水，滩多、水浅、漕窄，礁石历历在目，给水上运输带来了一系列的困难。为了战胜枯水，这个公司的广大职工克服各种困难，创造了许多经验，取得了枯水运输夺高产的胜利。公司党委为了充分运用去冬今春战胜枯水季节的经验，早在今年洪水尚未退落之前，就分析了四季度和明年一季度工农业生产和货运量增长的形势，对比了目前与去年同期水位退落情况。一方面加强对职工的思想教育，使大家充分认识水上运输的重要地位以及战胜枯水的各种有利条件，同时从设备、劳动力和组织领导等各个方面采取了一系列的具体措施，并组织专人对河床变化情况进行了调查。
    改革船型，这是去年战胜枯水的一项重要经验。他们根据本市河流情况，总结了两年来船型改革的丰富经验，经过反复研究、比较，在过去改制的各种优良船型中，选择了具有吃水浅、载量大、航速快、适宜于枯水航行的立枋浮筒这一优良船型，新改制了大批立枋浮筒船。担负着煤、焦运输繁重任务的嘉陵江站，11月份已有30％的船只实现了浮筒化，大大增加了运输力量。这种船型在吃水深度不增加的情况下，运量一般增加30％，为实现枯水季节“大船不减载，小船多超载”创造了有利的条件。全公司通过船型改革，增加的运力即达船只总吨位的30％左右，比今年新造木船吨位多十五倍，为国家增加了大批运力。为了保证枯水季节船只安全高产，他们除了大搞船型改革以外，还对原有的浅水拖轮和部分船只进行了检修，嘉陵江站并全面检查了船只的吨位、质量和工具配备等，为战胜枯水夺高产做好了充分的准备工作。
    去年由于对枯水情况估计不足，设备准备不够充分，每天要用八百多个劳动力分散在各个险滩拉滩，既影响了运输效率，又占用了很多劳动力。为了吸取这个经验，他们就针对拉滩工作大搞技术革新。在枯水到来之前，他们即对嘉陵江各险滩拉滩机械进行了详细研究和规划，采取自力更生、土洋结合的办法，制造了六个绞滩机。在水位已经归漕的红沙碛险滩，绞滩机已牢固地立于滩上。其余的绞滩机，等水位归漕，即可马上安装，每部绞滩机可以代替一百多人拉滩，并可大大提高运输效率。
    整治航道是保证枯水季节的水上运输畅通无阻和增加运量的一个重要环节。过去几年在整治嘉陵江航道方面取得了很大成绩。根据去年战胜枯水的经验，今年的航道整治工作动手特别早，到11月底，筑坝工程已完成了50％左右，淘漕和炸礁工程根据水位的下降情况，也正加速进行。（附图片）
