Poem Written on a New Year's Card
Li Ying

These thin pieces of paper, are like nimble birds;
These rough lines of poetry, like grains of sand, carry my deepest greetings...

To the Dockworkers of Havana
You stand on the Havana docks, sending a message to the world:
"I am the people, I am the master!"
Good, your words stir the clouds,
From the waves of the sea, I see your magnificent spirit.
You stand bare-chested, driving away the enemy,
(...this was two years ago.)
Now you guard the gates amidst the sound of alarms.
The New Year is here, I congratulate you, brothers,
I wish you a New Year that will unload ten thousand tons of friendship,
But at the same time, pay ten thousand times the caution to the enemy!

To the Soldiers of the Algerian National Liberation Army
The thunderous year has passed, first, let me offer my greetings to you.
This year, how many enemies did you kill,
How many guns, horses did you capture.
1961 is coming in triumph,
You will write even more beautiful poems;
Arm your motherland,
And advance shoulder to shoulder with it,
With one bullet, one bayonet.
The New Year will bring you greater joy,
How beautiful is the freedom born in battle;
Let the enemies' bones lie scattered on the sand,
Raise the great flag high, like a red sun!

To the Soldiers of the Congo
Fighting Congolese soldiers, Happy New Year!
Write 1960 in red letters in history:
Dip in the sunshine, write the glory of independence,
Dip in blood, write the sacred sound of gunfire.
At dawn, I see the bonfires on the banks of the Congo River extinguished,
But hatred burns even more fiercely;
Scoop up a handful of water from the motherland's river,
Drink it all in one gulp,
In the New Year, let it stir up even bigger waves in your heart.
Fight bravely together with your people,
Please believe in your own strength;
For the sake of the young motherland, for the sake of Africa,
Resolutely bury the old and new colonialism completely!
1961 is calling, is listening -
Your flags are flying, drums are sounding on the desert;
Use your guns and bullets to tell it:
The Congolese will never fail the sun overhead!

To the Farmers Under Mount Fuji
The year is ending, the snow is vast and white,
Under Mount Fuji, the US military's barbed wire fences, row upon row,
Like teeth, gleam brightly.
Here are artillery groups, there are airfields,
The anchor chains of the Yokosuka port's warships,
Are directly locked onto Mount Fuji...
Farmers at the foot of the mountain, you are doing well,
Stirring up big waves to eliminate US military bases:
"Down with Ikeda! Get out American Imperialists!"
The language of anger, burned red, is like iron and steel.
1961 sounds the assembly call,
And the volcano clusters across the country will also surge onto the square with you,
To fight, to use the final united action,
To send the Japan-US military alliance treaty to its funeral!

To the Imprisoned Spanish Patriots
Go and ask the lock in front of you,
What exactly can it lock up?
You welcome a new song, pillowing on the sound of death guns.
Perhaps in the small cell, the stone wall breaks your head;
But your heart soars over the entire motherland,
How vast is your world!
1961 - the real spring is coming,
It will give you a ground full of colorful flowers;
I send you greetings from distant Beijing,
The dark prison will be broken.
For the true warrior, struggle is the only song;
Even if the shackles dig into your flesh,
Please ask: what can it lock up?

### 写在贺年片的诗

    写在贺年片的诗
    李瑛这张张薄薄的纸片，却像只只矫健的鸟；这行行砂砾似的粗犷的诗句，却带去我深深的问好……
    给哈瓦那的码头工人你站在哈瓦那码头上，向全世界发出了声音：
  “我是人民，我就是主人！”好呵，你们的话搅动了风云，从大海的波涛，我看见你壮阔的胸襟。你赤膊挺起，把敌人赶走，
  （……这已是两年前的事。）如今你在警报声中把守着大门。新年来了，我祝贺你，兄弟们，祝你新年将卸进一万吨友谊，但同时，对敌人要付出十万倍的小
  心！
    给阿尔及利亚民族解放军战士雷声滚滚的一年已经过去，首先向你们致意。这一年，你们击毙多少敌人，缴获了多少枪枝、马匹。1961年正在凯歌声中走来，你们将写出更美的诗；把祖国武装起来，和它并肩前进，用一粒子弹，一柄枪刺。新的一年将给你们更大的快乐，战斗中诞生的自由多么美丽；让敌人在砂砾上尸骨横陈，把大旗高举，像一轮红日！
    给刚果士兵战斗的刚果士兵，新年好！用红字把1960写在历史上：蘸着阳光，写独立的光荣，蘸着血，写神圣的枪响。黎明，我看见刚果河畔的篝火熄了，但仇恨却燃烧得正旺；掬一捧祖国的河水，一饮而尽，新的一年，就让它在心头掀起更大
  的波浪。和你的人民一起勇敢的战斗呵，请相信自己的力量；为了年轻的祖国，为了非洲，坚决把新老殖民主义彻底埋葬！1961年在召唤、在倾听——你大漠上的旗飞鼓响；用你的枪和子弹告诉它：刚果人绝不会愧对头上的太阳！
    给富士山下的农民岁暮了，大雪茫茫，富士山下，美军的铁丝网一排排，像牙齿，闪闪发亮。这边是炮群，那边是机场，横须贺港舰艇的锚链，直锁在富士山上……山脚的农民们，你们干得好呵，为取消美军基地掀起大波大浪：“打倒池田！滚开美帝！”愤怒烧红的语言，如铁似钢。1961年吹响集合号，要全国的火山群也随你们拥上广
  场，去战斗，去用最后一次统一行动，给日美军事同盟条约送葬！
    给被囚禁的西班牙爱国者去问一问你面前的锁，它究竟能锁住什么？你枕着死亡的枪响，又迎来一支新歌。也许在狭小的牢房里，石墙把你的头颅碰破；可你的心却翱翔在整个祖国，你的世界多么广阔！1961年——真正的春天将临，它将赠你满地缤纷的花朵；我从遥远的北京向你问候，阴暗的牢狱就将被打破。对于真正的战士，斗争就是唯一的歌；纵使镣铐扣进了你的皮肉，请问：它又能锁住什么？
