Party Committee Secretary's Notes

	Grasping "Characteristics"
	Guo Lidao, First Secretary of the CPC Lueyang County Committee, Shaanxi

	Lueyang County is a mountainous county located between the Qinling and Bashan Mountains, through which the Shu Road, "more difficult than ascending to heaven," passes. Li Bai wrote in his famous poem "The Difficulty of the Shu Road": "The Qingni Ridge winds and turns, with nine bends every hundred steps, circling the cliffs." This describes the difficult, dangerous, and rugged conditions of the Qingni Ridge road in Lueyang County. Before liberation, people lived a very poor life in the inaccessible mountains, under the dark rule of the old society. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the people achieved political liberation, and their economic and cultural outlook has greatly changed, and their lives have greatly improved. However, grain production has not developed rapidly, and sometimes it is necessary to rely on grain allocation from other places for relief. Since the Great Leap Forward, the industrial and agricultural outlook has rapidly changed, and grain production has increased. This year, despite severe disasters, it has still increased compared to last year, transforming from a grain-deficient county to a grain-surplus county.

	The natural conditions in mountainous areas are vastly different. In such areas, to do a good job in agricultural production, it is necessary to fully understand and grasp the natural conditions of the mountainous areas and make arrangements according to local conditions.

	For example, the issue of planting more and harvesting more versus high yield and harvesting more. Mountainous areas have vast land, complex terrain, steep slopes, and thin soil, making land cultivation relatively difficult. In such cases, seizing the opportunity to plant more and harvest more is of more practical significance. While planting more and harvesting more, it is also necessary to pay attention to high yield and harvesting more. The method is to implement the "Eight-Character Charter" in accordance with local conditions.

	The complex natural conditions determine the diversification of crops. "Beating gongs (praying for rain) in the river valley, eating steamed buns (referring to a bumper harvest) on the high mountains." Different natural conditions have different adaptability to crops. For example, hull-less oats are suitable for high mountains, cold areas, and thin soil; Bashan beans are suitable for stony soil; small red beans are suitable for yellow mud soil; bitter buckwheat is suitable for shady slopes in high mountains, etc. We have emphasized planting different crops according to the different characteristics of the land. It is required that high mountains, mid-level mountains, and river valleys should focus on grain, miscellaneous grains, and potatoes together, planting whatever is suitable. Another measure similar to multi-crop varieties that can fully utilize land fertility is intercropping, tall stalks intercropped with short stalks, grains intercropped with potatoes and vegetables. Some natural conditions in mountainous areas can be gradually changed through human initiative. When conditions change, their adaptability will also change accordingly.

	Adapting to local conditions is one aspect, and adapting to the seasons is another. The complex geographical and climatic conditions of mountainous areas are also reflected in the agricultural seasons. For example, in the wheat ripening season, when wheat is harvested in the river valleys, some wheat in the high mountains is still in the heading and flowering stage, with a difference of one and a half months. The so-called agricultural season is the timing, which is reflected in all aspects of production activities. For example, the timing of harvesting is "yellow grain should not be left overnight," "harvest when it is 90% yellow, and you get 100% yield"; the timing of management, such as corn, is mainly timely weeding, "if the first weeding is missed, you won't see it again; if the second weeding is missed, you'll only harvest half"; the timing of plowing is "plowing in August yields a bowl of oil, plowing in September yields half a bowl of oil, plowing in October yields no oil." In doing any work, it is necessary to "assess the situation," accurately judge the right moment, and seize the opportunity. At the most appropriate time, concentrate the greatest strength to complete the most needed tasks.

	Mountainous areas have many natural disasters, such as drought, flood, wind, hail, birds, beasts, diseases, and insects. Recognizing and grasping the laws of these natural disasters is a necessary condition for fighting against them. For example, the meteorological law of mountainous areas is that there is spring drought and autumn flood, with more floods than droughts. We can arrange agricultural production according to this law, avoid the unfavorable factors of this law on agricultural production, and fully utilize its favorable factors. For example, potatoes are prone to late blight when planted in river valleys, so we can plant more on mid-level mountains; buckwheat is prone to insect pests when planted early, so we can plant it at the right time. Harmful animals are the great enemies of agricultural production, therefore, hunting has become an important measure to strive for a bumper harvest. Hunting also has its objective laws. For example, the law of animal activity is: "Deer run on ridges, pigs run in saddles, and muntjacs run on rocky slopes." The law of hunting is: "Hunting musk deer is like putting on a show, hunting wild boars is like taking one breath." This autumn, the county launched a hunting campaign to protect the autumn harvest, and according to statistics from just over two months, more than 6,500 harmful animals of all sizes were hunted, saving grain from significant losses. We must recognize the laws of nature, be the masters of nature, transform nature with a revolutionary spirit, and enable nature to provide the potential for grain production for the people.

	Adapting to local conditions is a positive, objective, and targeted attitude. Adapting to local conditions does not exclude advanced experiences and scientific technologies from other places. Agricultural production knowledge, like other knowledge, is improved and enriched through continuous practice, continuous exchange, mutual inspiration, and mutual supplementation. In implementing the Party's policies, being good at adapting to local conditions, adapting to the seasons, grasping the characteristics, and solving specific problems in a realistic and pragmatic way will ensure that one is invincible.

    抓“特点”
    中共陕西略阳县委第一书记　郭力道
    略阳县是位于秦岭、巴山之间的一个山区县，是“难于上青天”的蜀道经过之地。李白在有名的《蜀道难》一诗中写的：“青泥何盘盘，百步九折萦岩峦。”就是描述略阳县青泥岭道路之艰难险阻、崎岖曲折状况的。解放以前，人民在交通闭塞的万山丛中，在旧社会黑暗统治下，过着非常贫苦的生活。解放以后，人民在党的领导下，政治上翻了身，经济文化面貌有了很大改变，生活有了很大提高。但粮食生产发展不快，有时还要靠外地拨粮救济。大跃进以来，工农业面貌迅速改观，粮食产量增加了，今年在灾害重重的情况下，仍然比去年增长了，由缺粮县变为余粮县。
    山区的自然条件是千差万别的。在这样的地区，要搞好农业生产，必须充分认识和掌握山区的自然条件，因地制宜地布置安排工作。
    比如，多种多收和高产多收问题。山区地面辽阔，地形复杂，坡陡土薄，土地加工比较困难。在这样情况下，抓紧多种多收，更具有现实意义。在多种多收的同时也要重视高产多收。办法就是因地制宜地贯彻执行“八字宪法”。
    复杂的自然条件决定了农作物的多样化。“河坝打锣（指祈雨），高山吃馍（指丰收）。”不同的自然条件，对农作物各有其不同的适应性。如洋燕麦适宜于高山、寒冷、土薄的土地，巴山豆适宜于石渣地，小豆适宜于黄泥地，苦荞适宜于高山阴坡地，等等。我们强调了根据土地的不同特性，因地制宜地种植不同作物。要求高山、半山、河坝，主粮、杂粮、薯类一齐抓，适宜种什么就种什么。与作物多品种可以充分利用地力相同的另一个措施是套种，高秆套矮秆，粮食套薯类、蔬菜。山区的某些自然条件是可以通过人的能动性逐步加以改变的，条件改变了，它的适应性也将随之发生变化。
    因地制宜是一条，因时制宜又是一条。山区复杂的地理气候条件，反映在农时季节上也是十分复杂的。如小麦成熟的季节，河坝小麦收割的时候，有些高山的小麦还在吐穗扬花，早晚相差一个半月。所谓农时季节就是时机，它反映在生产活动的各个方面。比如收的时机是“黄粮不过夜”，“九成黄，十成收”；管的时机如包谷主要是及时锄草，“荒了头道不见面，荒了二道收一半”；犁田的时机是“八月犁田一碗油，九月犁田半碗油，十月犁田没有油”。做任何工作，都要“审时度势”，看准火候，抓住时机。在最适宜的时机，集中最大力量，做完最需要做的事情。
    山区的自然灾害是很多的，旱、涝、风、雹、鸟、兽、病、虫等等。认识和掌握这些自然灾害的规律，是同自然灾害作斗争的必要条件。比如，山区的气象规律是春旱秋涝，涝多旱少。我们就可以根据这个规律安排农业生产，避开这个规律对农业生产的不利因素，充分利用其有利因素。比如，洋芋种在河坝容易生晚疫病，我们就可以多在半山去种，荞麦种早了容易生虫害，我们就可以适时下种。害兽是农业生产的大敌，因此，打猎就成了争取丰收的重要措施。打猎也有它的客观规律。例如，野兽活动的规律是：“鹿跑峁，猪跑垭，麂子跑的花岩巴”。打的规律是：“香子打的一台戏，野猪打的一口气”。今年秋季，全县开展的打猎保秋运动，仅据两个多月时间的统计，就猎获大小害兽六千五百多只，使粮食免受重大损失。我们要认识自然规律，要作大自然的主人，要用革命的精神改造自然，使大自然为人们提供粮食生产的潜在能力。
    因地制宜是积极的、客观的、有的放矢的态度。因地制宜也绝不排斥外地的先进经验和科学技术。农业生产知识同其他知识一样，是通过不断实践、不断交流、相互启发、相互补充的过程而提高和丰富起来的。在贯彻党的政策过程中，善于因地制宜，因时制宜，掌握特点，实事求是地解决具体问题，就能够立于不败之地。
