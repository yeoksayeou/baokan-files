The workers of the Gongzhuling Sheet Metal Factory, actively responding to the call of the CPC Siping Prefectural Committee to prepare early for next year's agricultural production, have successfully trial-produced a horse-drawn sprayer after completing the task of producing 2,100 compressed sprayers this year ahead of schedule. Its characteristics are large spraying area, fast speed, and good effect. With such a machine, one person and one animal can complete spraying ten hectares per day, and the work efficiency is about twenty times higher than that of a compressed sprayer.

    积极试制新喷雾器
    公主岭钣金厂职工，积极响应中共四平地委关于明年农业生产要早作准备的号召，在提前完成了今年生产两千一百台压缩喷雾器的任务后，又试制成功一台马拉喷雾机。它的特点是喷洒面积大，速度快，效果好。用这样的机器一人一畜每天能完成喷洒十公顷的任务，工效比压缩喷雾器提高二十倍左右。
