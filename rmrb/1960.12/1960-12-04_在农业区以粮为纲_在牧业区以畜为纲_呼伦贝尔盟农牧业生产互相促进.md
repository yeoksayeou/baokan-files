Hulunbuir League Promotes Mutual Development of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry
(Our report) The Communist Party committees at all levels in the Hulunbuir League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, relying on the superiority of the rural and pastoral people's communes, are implementing the policy of giving equal importance to crop cultivation and animal husbandry, and the Party's various agricultural and pastoral production policies, based on local conditions, achieving a continuous three-year leap forward in agricultural and pastoral production. The lives of people of all ethnic groups have also greatly improved.
Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, thanks to the hard work and self-reliance of the people of all ethnic groups in Hulunbuir League, agricultural and pastoral production has increased year by year. This year, the total grain output of the league increased by 1.2 times compared to 1957, with an average of about 2,000 jin of grain produced per agricultural person. In the past three years, the league's livestock increased by 31.34%, an average annual increase of 9.6%. Since the end of last year, thanks to the in-depth development of the mass movement of "one hundred mothers, one hundred offspring," more than 600,000 young animals have survived this year. As a result of the continuous increase in agricultural and pastoral production, the league has sold 300,000 to 400,000 tons of grain and more than 100,000 head of livestock annually in the past three years to support national construction. This year, the league delivered 18% more grain to the state than in 1959, and transported more than 160,000 head of draught animals, Sanhe cattle, Sanhe horses, and other fine breeds of livestock, as well as beef and mutton, to various regions.
With the development of production, the living standards of people of all ethnic groups in the league have also greatly improved. In 1957, the average income of each farmer and herder in the league was only about 60 yuan, but now it has increased to more than 90 yuan. In some banners and cities north of the Greater Khingan Mountains, the average income per person is over 200 to 300 yuan. The Hongqi Brigade of the Juligen People's Commune in the Right Wing Front Banner of Horqin, which used to be known as "Poor Guanjia Gully" and "Donkey Village," has transformed from poor to rich after years of continuous leap forward in production. All 507 member households in the brigade now have savings in the bank.
Agriculture and animal husbandry are interdependent and mutually promoting. Based on this dialectical relationship, the Communist Party committees at all levels in Hulunbuir League have adhered to the policy of giving equal importance to crop cultivation and animal husbandry for several years. In agricultural areas, they implement the principle of focusing on agriculture, taking grain as the key, combining agriculture and animal husbandry, and engaging in diversified operations. In pastoral areas, they implement the principle of focusing on animal husbandry, taking livestock as the key, and combining agriculture and animal husbandry. The league resolutely implemented the combination of multiple planting and high yields, simultaneous operation of agriculture and animal husbandry, and large-scale development of agriculture and animal husbandry in rural areas. As a result, the planting area of people's communes and state-owned farms throughout the league this year increased by more than 10% compared to last year. And they have reclaimed 4.6 million mu of wasteland, laying the foundation for increased production next year. Due to the active implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture and various measures to increase and protect livestock, the level of agricultural and pastoral production management and technology has been unprecedentedly improved. This year, the irrigated area in the league reached more than 1.8 million mu, an increase of seven times compared to 1957. The fertilized area has accounted for more than 80% of the total planting area. Pastoral areas have completed more than 2.6 billion jin of grass harvesting, built more than 870,000 square meters of new sheds, and vigorously developed water sources in water-scarce pasture areas. In the past three years, under the promotion of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, people's communes and farms, in addition to arming agriculture and animal husbandry with more than 2,000 standard tractors, have also promoted more than 18,000 new agricultural tools and more than 130,000 improved agricultural tools. Due to the realization of mechanization and semi-mechanization, labor efficiency has increased by more than one time on average, saving about 3.6 million workdays for the league. In the Evenk Autonomous Banner's 80,000 hectares of grain and feed base, the area of mechanized cultivation has reached more than 40%. The banner's grass harvesting work has been completed by more than 90% of the planned 2 billion jin, due to the complete realization of mechanized and semi-mechanized production. In addition, great achievements have also been made in the promotion of improved varieties and close planting. For example, in the Right Wing Front Banner of Horqin, five crops, including sorghum, millet, corn, and soybeans, have been widely implemented with close planting and mixed planting this year, and the number of plants has generally increased by 30% compared with previous years. Among them, mixed planting of soybeans alone has resulted in an additional harvest of more than 40 million jin of soybeans in the banner.
At the same time, the rural and pastoral areas of the league, according to the principle of giving equal importance to the development of livestock numbers and the improvement of livestock quality, have vigorously developed animal husbandry production. In particular, in order to comprehensively and rapidly develop animal husbandry, the various grassland pastoral areas, in addition to taking various effective measures to improve the management and feeding of livestock, have also established large-scale grain and feed bases in recent years, planting a large amount of wheat, oats, alfalfa, vegetables, etc. on the grasslands. As a result of the implementation of focusing on animal husbandry and combining agriculture and animal husbandry, not only have the areas achieved self-sufficiency or partial self-sufficiency in grain and feed, but also the herders of all ethnic groups have used grain and vegetables to replace part of their meat consumption, reducing livestock consumption and increasing the accumulation of livestock. For example, the Huhe Naoer Brigade of the Huhe Naoer Commune in Chen Barag Banner has vigorously developed agriculture and achieved self-sufficiency in grain and vegetables. This year, the net increase rate of livestock reached more than 15%, and the number of livestock in the brigade has reached more than 11,000, an increase of 83% compared with 1958. This has greatly promoted the development of animal husbandry production. Now, the five categories of livestock in the league have increased from more than 2.2 million in 1957 to more than 2.9 million. All kinds of improved livestock have reached more than 390,000.

    在农业区以粮为纲　在牧业区以畜为纲
    呼伦贝尔盟农牧业生产互相促进
    本报讯　内蒙古自治区呼伦贝尔盟各级党委，依靠农村牧区人民公社的优越性，因地制宜，全面贯彻执行种植业与饲养业并举的方针和党的各项农牧业生产政策，取得了农牧业生产连续三年跃进的胜利。各族人民生活也有了很大改善和提高。
    1958年大跃进以来，由于呼伦贝尔盟各族人民，发愤图强，艰苦奋斗，农牧业生产逐年上升。今年全盟粮食总产量比1957年增长一点二倍，平均每个农业人口生产粮食约二千斤。三年中，这个盟的牲畜增长31.34％，每年平均递增9.6％。从去年年底，各族农牧民由于深入地开展了“百母百仔”的群众运动，今年成活了六十多万头仔畜。农牧业生产连年上升结果，在过去三年中，全盟每年出售三、四十万吨粮食和十多万头牲畜来支援国家建设。今年全盟交售给国家的粮食比1959年增加18％，输送各地的役畜、三河牛、三河马等优良种畜及食用牛羊达十六万多头。
    随着生产的发展，这个盟各族人民的生活水平也有了很大提高。1957年全盟每个农牧民的平均收入仅为六十元左右，现在已提高到九十多元。大兴安岭以北一些旗市，每人平均收入都在二三百元以上。这个盟的科尔沁右翼前旗居力很人民公社红旗大队，过去被人们称为“穷关家沟”、“毛驴屯”，经过这几年生产连续跃进由穷变富，全大队五百零七户社员，现在都在银行有存款。
    农业和畜牧业是互相依存，互相促进的。呼伦贝尔盟各级党委根据这种辩证关系，几年来，坚持种植业与饲养业并举的方针，在农业区实行以农为主，以粮为纲，农牧结合，多种经营。在牧区实行以牧为主，以畜为纲，农牧结合。这个盟在农村坚决贯彻了多种多收和高产多收相结合，经营农业和经营畜牧业同时并举，大办农业、大办畜牧业的方针。结果，今年全盟各人民公社和国营农牧场播种面积比去年扩大10％以上。并开垦了四百六十万亩荒地，为明年增产奠定了基础。由于积极地贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”和增畜保畜的各项措施，使农牧业生产经营和技术水平有了空前提高。今年全盟灌溉面积达到一百八十多万亩，比1957年增长了七倍。施肥面积已经占总播种面积的80％以上。牧区打草完成二十六亿多斤，新建棚圈八十七万多平方米，并且大力开发缺水牧场地区的水源。近三年内，各人民公社和农牧场，在技术革新和技术革命运动的推动下，除以二千多标准台拖拉机武装农牧业外，还推广了一万八千多件新式农具和十三万多件改良农具。由于实现了机械化半机械化，劳动效率平均提高一倍以上，全盟大约节省三百六十万个工作日。鄂温克族自治旗八万公顷粮食和饲料基地中，机耕面积已达40％以上。全旗打草工作由于完全实现了机械化半机械化生产，已超额90％完成今年打草二十亿斤的计划。此外，在推广良种和密植等方面也获得巨大成绩。如科尔沁右翼前旗今年高粱、谷子、玉米、大豆等五种作物普遍实行密植及混种后，株数普遍比往年增加30％，其中仅混种大豆一项，全旗就多收获大豆四千多万斤。
    与此同时，这个盟的农村牧区根据发展牲畜头数与提高牲畜质量并重的方针，大力发展了畜牧业生产。特别是各草原牧区为了全面高速度地发展畜牧业，除采取各种有效措施，千方百计改进牲畜的经营管理和牧畜饲养外，近几年还大办了粮食饲料基地，在草原上种植大量小麦、燕麦、苜蓿、蔬菜等。由于实行以牧为主，农牧结合的结果，各地不仅做到粮食饲料自给或部分自给，而且各族牧民用粮食和蔬菜代替了部分肉食，减少了牲畜消耗，增加了畜群积累。如陈巴尔虎旗呼和淖尔公社呼和淖尔大队由于大力发展农业，实现了粮食蔬菜自给自足，今年牲畜纯增率达15％以上，全大队牲畜头数已达一万一千多头，比1958年增长83％。这就大大促进了畜牧业生产的大发展。现在全盟五类牲畜已由1957年的二百二十多万头发展到二百九十多万头。各种改良牲畜达到三十九万多头。
