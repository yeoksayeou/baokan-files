Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 17th. The Lao legal government radio station broadcast tonight a communiqué from the Royal Lao Government to local governments and the people of the whole country, regarding the withdrawal of government organs and the Royal Armed Forces General Headquarters from Vientiane.

The communiqué said that with the help of U.S. imperialism and the Thai reactionaries, the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum-Nachampassak traitorous clique attacked the capital, Vientiane.

"In order to wage a long-term struggle, the government has decided to withdraw government organs and the Royal Armed Forces General Headquarters from Vientiane."

The communiqué said, "The government calls on the military and civilians of Vientiane and the military and civilians of the whole country to unite closely around Prince Souvanna Phouma and continue to wage a resolute struggle against the aggressive conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and the Thai reactionaries, liberate our beloved capital, and thereby liberate the country from the control of U.S. imperialism and its reactionaries, so as to create conditions for Laos to advance on the path of peace and neutrality declared by the government of Prince Souvanna Phouma."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 17th. The Lao legal government radio station broadcast tonight a statement by Captain Kong Le, Commander of the Vientiane Garrison, on the withdrawal from Vientiane, calling on the army in Vientiane and throughout the country to unite, and together with the people, resolutely struggle to the end against the American and Thai aggressors and the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum-Nachampassak traitorous clique, for the liberation of the capital and the entire country.

The statement said, "After five days of heroic fighting against the aggression of the United States and Thailand and the attack of the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique, the government forces, the Lao Fighting Units, and the youth armed forces in Vientiane have accepted orders and withdrawn from their defended locations to outside the city to continue fighting."

The statement said, "In resisting the enemy's offensive, although the enemy had several times more troops than us, equipped with the latest U.S.-aided weapons and utilizing favorable bases in Thailand to advance on and fire at Vientiane, the government forces, enhancing their heroic fighting spirit and noble patriotism, repelled the enemy's many offensives. Fierce battles unfolded in every place and every house, and many of the enemy's strongholds were destroyed, such as their strongholds at the U.S., Thai, and South Vietnamese embassies, the U.S. Information Service, and U.S. 'aid' agencies."

The statement announced, "We have inflicted over three hundred casualties on the enemy, captured over one hundred prisoners, including officers and soldiers from the United States, Thailand, South Vietnam, the Philippines, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, as well as two lieutenant colonels and some officers from the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique. We destroyed and captured a batch of tanks, armored vehicles, gunboats, 105mm artillery pieces, and many U.S.-aided weapons and war materials. Many rebel officers and soldiers who were deceived and coerced by the traitorous clique defected to the government side." The statement pointed out that "The United States and the Thai aggressors, as well as the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique, have successively reinforced troops and weapons from Thailand. They are attempting to occupy our country and turn our country into their colony and military base."

The statement said, "The task of the government forces and the patriotic armed forces of the whole country is to advance the movement to save the country together with the people. We cannot act as slaves of the United States and Thailand. We can no longer regress to living the hungry and painful life under the brutal rule of the lackeys of U.S. imperialism as we did before August 9, 1960."

The statement said, "I call on the Lao troops who, under the coercion of the Phoumi-Boun Oum clique, are resisting the country and the legitimate government, to turn their guns around and cooperate with the army of the legitimate government to oppose the common enemy of the Lao nation."

    新华社河内17日电　据老挝合法政府广播电台今天晚上广播，老挝王国政府就政府机关和王国军队总指挥部撤出万象，向各地政府和全国人民发表公报。
    公报说，在美帝国主义和泰国反动派的帮助下富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞叛国集团进攻首都万象。
  “为了进行长期斗争，政府决定把政府机关和王国军队总指挥部撤出万象。”
    公报说，“政府号召万象军民和全国军民紧密团结在梭发那·富马亲王的周围，继续进行坚决斗争，反对美帝国主义和泰国反动派的侵略阴谋，解放我们可爱的首都，从而把国家从美帝国主义及其反动派的控制下解放出来，为使老挝在梭发那·富马亲王政府所宣布的和平中立道路上前进创造条件。”
    新华社河内17日电　据老挝合法政府广播电台今晚广播，万象卫戍司令贡勒大尉就撤离万象发表声明，号召在万象和全国各地的军队团结起来，和人民一起为反对美国、泰国的侵略者和富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞叛国集团，为首都和全国的解放坚决斗争到底。
    声明说，“经过五天来对美国、泰国的侵略和富米—文翁叛国集团的进攻的英勇战斗后，在万象的政府军、寮国战斗部队和青年武装力量接受命令，已经从据守的地点撤到城外，继续战斗。”
    声明说，“在反对敌人的进攻中，尽管敌人兵力比我们多几倍，配备着美国援助的最新武器和利用在泰国的有利基地向万象进军和射击，但是，政府的部队，提高了英勇战斗和崇高的爱国精神，打退了敌人的多次进攻，每一处、每一座房屋都展开了激烈的争夺，并且摧毁了敌人的许多据点，如他们设在美国、泰国和南越大使馆、美国新闻处和美国“援助”机关等地的据点。
    声明宣布，“我们已使敌人伤亡达三百多名，活捉了一百多名俘虏，其中有美国、泰国、南越、菲律宾、蒋介石集团的官兵以及富米—文翁叛国集团的两名中校和一些军官。我们击毁和缴获了一批坦克、装甲车、炮艇、一零五毫米大炮以及美国援助的许多武器和战争物资。许多受叛国集团欺骗、强迫的叛军官兵投诚到政府方面。”声明指出，“美国和泰国侵略者以及富米—文翁叛国集团相继从泰国增援军队和武器。它们企图占领我国，使我国变成他们的殖民地和军事基地。”
    声明说，“政府军队和全国的爱国武装力量的任务是要和人民一道推进救国运动。我们不能充当美国、泰国的奴仆。我们不能再倒退回去过着如同1960年8月9日以前的在美帝国主义的走狗们的残暴的统治下那样的饥饿痛苦的生活。”
    声明说，“我号召在富米—文翁集团的胁迫下反抗国家和合法政府的老挝部队的弟兄们，掉转枪口，同合法政府的军队合作，反对老挝民族的共同敌人。”
