    Model Squad Leader Wang Liangming

    Wang Liangming, a Communist Party member and model squad leader of the Greening Production Team of the Yujin Commune in Lintong County, Shaanxi, has participated in and led production for four years as if it were a single day, becoming a good example of productive labor, team management, and connecting with the masses.

    Since becoming a squad leader, Wang Liangming, a Communist Party member, has always consulted the Party branch when encountering problems, and sought advice from older poor and lower-middle peasants when he didn’t understand farming. He often said, "I, this squad leader, have no clever tricks, just working together with everyone." Wherever the work is heavy, he goes there; wherever it is most difficult, Wang Liangming is there. He said, "Discovering problems from labor, and promoting work from solving problems, only by combining labor and work can we achieve a double harvest in labor and work, and only by mobilizing everyone to offer suggestions can production become even more red."

    模范小队长王亮明
    陕西临潼县雨金公社绿化生产队模范小队长王亮明，四年如一日地参加生产、领导生产，成为生产劳动、队务管理、联系群众的良好榜样。
    共产党员王亮明，从担任小队长时起，就抱着遇事多请示党支部，不懂的农事活路，就找年长的贫雇农当“参谋”。他常说：“我这个队长呀，没有巧法儿，就是和大家一起干”。那里的活重，他就到那里去，那里最艰苦，那里就有王亮明。他说：“从劳动中发现问题，从解决问题中推动工作，只有劳动和工作结合起来，才能获得劳动工作双丰收，只有发动大家出谋定计，生产才能搞的红上加红”。
