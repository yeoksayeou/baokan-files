Xinhua News Agency, December 26th. The large-scale color documentary "Fighting Cuba," filmed by Chinese photographers and reflecting the great scenes of the heroic Cuban people's anti-imperialist struggle, will be released nationwide on New Year's Day, 1961 – the glorious festival of the Cuban people's establishment of a revolutionary regime.

Almost every shot in "Fighting Cuba" is beautiful and moving. It not only presents the beautiful and rich island nation of Cuba, located in the Caribbean Sea in the Western Hemisphere and surrounded by green sea waves, arousing people's yearning for it; at the same time, this film also angrily exposes the shameful history of imperialist plunder and trampling on Cuba for three hundred years; and truthfully records the heroic and tenacious struggles of the Cuban people, who have followed one another in the fight for independence and freedom, and the great victories they have achieved. The film confirms to people that Cuba finally belongs to the Cuban people; the Cuban people, under the leadership of the revolutionary government headed by Prime Minister Castro, are resolutely cutting off the aggressive claws of U.S. imperialism and vigilantly safeguarding their motherland and the fruits of the revolution.

"Fighting Cuba," from beginning to end, reflects the heroic spirit, boiling revolutionary enthusiasm, and vast mass momentum of the heroic, all-out-for-defense Cuban people in resisting U.S. imperialist aggression, their will and actions. From this film, people will see that the Cuban people, who have already won independence and freedom, proudly raised the Cuban flag on more than sixty company and sugar factory buildings that used to belong to the Americans; and held funerals for these companies, throwing coffins and fake corpses symbolizing American monopoly capital into the sea. The film exposes the open aggression and covert subversion activities carried out by U.S. imperialism, unwilling to accept the revolutionary victory of the Cuban people, and also praises the enthusiastic support of the people of the world for the Cuban people. The film also reports on the warm welcome given to the Chinese trade delegation and the Chinese art troupe in Cuba by the Cuban government and people, and records the sincere friendship between the Chinese and Cuban people. In short, "Fighting Cuba" introduces the heroic spirit of the Cuban people's anti-imperialist struggle; it also introduces the Cuban people's labor enthusiasm and ambition in building their motherland. This film will help our people further understand heroic Cuba and its people.

The photographers from the China News Documentary Film Studio received strong support from the Cuban revolutionary government and the Cuban people when they went to Cuba to film this movie. In more than four months, they traveled to every region of Cuba and filmed the shots they needed very smoothly. Wherever the photographers went, they were warmly welcomed by the Cuban people.
