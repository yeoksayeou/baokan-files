Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, December 12th: The Jiangxiang People's Commune in Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, has comprehensively implemented the Party's policies, greatly stimulating the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses. Commune members are seizing the key to increasing production next year, making early preparations for spring plowing, and striving for a bumper harvest of early rice and other summer crops next year. In the past twenty days, the commune has improved the soil on more than 20,000 mu of thin and barren land, accumulated more than 2 million dan of fertilizer, and repaired and added more than 10,000 various farm tools.

The Jiangxiang Commune conscientiously and comprehensively implemented the Party's policies, conveyed the policies to the masses, and further mobilized the enthusiasm of the commune members as masters of their own affairs in production. When discussing and arranging next year's production plans some time ago, the commune members of each production team, based on past experience and the fact that each team had a part of thin and barren land, believed that to strive for a bumper harvest of early rice and other summer crops next year, they should start this winter to transform low-yielding fields, accumulate fertilizer, and allocate tools. The commune and the leaders of each production team adopted the opinions of the commune members, made arrangements by production team, and while doing a good job in the field management of overwintering crops, they first concentrated part of their strength and took various measures to vigorously transform the low-yielding fields with poor soil quality. The Shanwei Production Team, with the team as a unit, organized 350 commune members into 14 shock teams, who traveled ten miles to one hundred and forty mu of thin land. They swept fallen leaves, shoveled turf, and accumulated fertilizer for the thin land; dug thin soil and carried fertile mud to replace the barren subsoil of the thin land; cut thorns and split mountain shade to increase sunlight for the thin land; and worked hard in winter plowing and turning the fields so that the soil of the thin land would be loosened during the winter and kill pests. Everyone worked hard, and in ten days, they accumulated 110 dan of fertilizer for each mu of thin land, replaced most of it with fertile soil and mud, removed the thorns on the edge of the fields, and carried out winter plowing and turning, laying the foundation for increasing the yield of these thin lands next year. The commune members of each team in the Dongye Production Team launched a competition to accumulate fertilizer for low-yielding fields. They drained eight large ponds and carried more than 10,000 dan of fertile pond mud, all of which was sent to the low-yielding fields. Li Lizao, an old commune member of this team, went to visit his daughter on a holiday, picking up wild manure along the way with a manure basket. His daughter said, "Why are you still picking up manure when you're visiting relatives?" He said, "The implementation of the policy is good, and the commune members are highly motivated. I pick up wild manure to show that I'm old but still have a young heart." This seventy-year-old commune member has recently picked up more than 2,000 jin of wild manure and applied it to the low-yielding fields.

While transforming thin fields, the production teams actively prepared tools and raised fat cattle early in preparation for spring plowing. The Chubei Production Team comprehensively checked the farm tools in each team, cleaned and oiled the good farm tools, put them in the warehouse, and kept them in charge by an old farmer; organized manpower to repair the damaged farm tools. At the same time, more than 1,000 new farm tools were added according to needs. Each production team in the commune also universally built cowsheds, fixed special personnel to raise them, and protected the cattle through the winter. The breeders of the Zhoutou Production Team spread grass in the evening to keep the cattle warm, led the cattle out to drink water and eat grass during the day, and often washed their mouths and noses with salt water to avoid poisoning from eating grass. Thanks to their careful breeding, all the cattle in the team grew fat and strong.

Under the leadership of the Party organizations at all levels of the commune, the commune members are also making preparations from various aspects such as living welfare to welcome the spring plowing next year. More than 300 public canteens in the commune have universally expanded the planting of vegetables, and each canteen has stored seven or eight jars of dried vegetables or sauerkraut, and stored thousands of kilograms of dry firewood and charcoal, preparing for the needs of the large-scale spring plowing production next year.

In order to strive for a summer harvest exceeding that of previous years, the commune members not only actively produce, but also take the initiative to offer opinions and ideas to the cadres on all matters related to production, big and small, and actively help the cadres to do a good job in preparing for spring plowing. The second team of the Zhoutou Production Team has two boats. In the fertilizer accumulation campaign, commune member Lu Yisheng suggested to team leader Lu Zhengzhou: draw out ten commune members to organize two groups, one group to drive a boat to Nanchang City to transport garbage fertilizer, and the other group to drive a boat to Poyang Lake to collect lake grass for composting. Lu Zhengzhou accepted this suggestion and immediately made arrangements, making full use of the two boats, accumulating more than 1,000 dan of fertilizer every day. Xiao Meimo, the leader of the first team of the Jiufang Production Team, also accepted the method proposed by the commune members, arranging for strong laborers to transform thin fields, female laborers to accumulate fertilizer, and old commune members to repair farm tools, so that the division of labor was reasonable and labor efficiency immediately increased by 40%.

The cadres at all levels of the commune have received a profound education after implementing the policies, and have more deeply experienced that by acting in accordance with the policies and relying on the masses, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome and no problems that cannot be solved. Therefore, their enthusiasm for work and labor is getting higher and higher. Many cadres of production teams have worked one or two tens of working days in the past twenty days. They not only discussed with the masses and led the masses in production, but also went to the canteens and kitchens to lead and help the commune members arrange their winter life, and conscientiously implemented the vacation system to achieve a combination of work and rest, leading the commune members to better carry out various spring plowing preparations.

    改造低产田　积造肥料　配置农具
    蒋巷公社提早备耕争取明年丰收
    新华社南昌12日电　江西南昌县蒋巷人民公社全面贯彻党的政策，大大激发了群众的革命干劲，社员们抓住明年增产关键，提早准备春耕，争取明年夏收丰收。近二十天来，全社已对二万多亩瘦田瘠地的土壤进行了改良，积造了二百多万担肥料，整修与添置了各种农具一万多件。
    蒋巷公社认真全面地贯彻党的政策，把政策交给群众，进一步调动了社员当家作主的生产积极性。各生产队的社员在前些时候讨论与安排明年生产计划时，根据以往经验和各队都有一部分瘦田瘠地等情况，认为要争取明年早稻等夏收作物丰收，今冬就得着手改造低产田、积造肥料和配置工具。公社和各生产队领导上采纳了社员们的意见，以生产小队为单位做好安排，在搞好越冬作物田间管理的同时，首先集中部分力量，采取各种措施大力改造土质瘠薄的低产田。山尾生产队以小队为单位，把三百五十名社员分别组成了十四个突击队，远征十里以外的一百四十亩瘦田，他们扫落叶、铲草皮，为瘦田积造肥料；挖瘦土、挑沃泥，为瘦田换上肥沃的底土；砍荆棘、劈山荫，为瘦田增加阳光日照；闹冬耕、翻田地，使瘦田土壤在过冬中得到疏松，冻死害虫。大家一股劲，十天间就为每亩瘦田积造了一百一十担肥料，大部分换上了肥土沃泥，砍除了田边荆棘，进行了冬耕冬翻，为这些瘦田明年增产打下了基础。东邺生产队各小队的社员开展了为低产田积肥的竞赛，他们车干了八口大水塘，挑出一万多担肥沃的塘泥，全部送到了低产田里。这个队的老社员李立早，在休假日去看望女儿，提着粪筐一路拾野粪，女儿说他走亲戚还拾什么粪，他说：“贯彻政策好，社员劲头高，我把野粪拣，表表我人老心不老。”这位七十多岁的老社员近来已拣了二千多斤野粪，施到了低产田中。
    在改造瘦田的同时，各生产队积极地提早准备工具、养肥耕牛，准备春耕。滁北生产队各小队全面清查农具，对好农具进行清洗、擦油，放进仓库，由一名老农保管；对已坏的农具组织人力整修。同时根据需要添置了一千多件新农具。全社各生产小队还普遍修建了牛栏，固定了专人饲养，保护耕牛过冬。洲头生产队的饲养员，在晚上给牛铺草避寒，白天牵牛出外喝水吃草，还经常用盐水给牛洗口洗鼻，以避免吃草中毒。由于他们细心饲养，全队耕牛头头长得膘肥腿壮。
    社员们在公社各级党组织的领导下，还从生活福利等多方面做好准备，迎接来年春耕。全社三百多个公共食堂普遍都扩种了蔬菜，各个食堂都储备了七、八缸干菜或酸菜，贮藏了数千斤干柴和烧炭，准备明年春耕大生产时的需要。
    为了争取明年夏收超往年，社员们不仅积极生产，而且见到生产上大大小小事情主动找干部提意见、出主意，积极帮助干部搞好备耕工作。洲头生产队第二小队有两只船，在积肥运动中社员卢义生就向小队长卢正周建议：抽出十个社员组织两个小组，一组驾一只船到南昌市运垃圾肥，一组驾一只船到鄱阳湖打湖草沤肥。卢正周接受这个建议立即进行安排，把两只船充分利用了起来，每天积肥一千多担。九房生产队第一小队队长萧美模也接受社员提出的办法，安排强劳力改造瘦田，女劳力积肥，老社员检修农具，作到了分工合理，劳动工效立即提高了40％。
    全社各级干部经过贯彻政策受到了深刻的教育，更加体验到按政策办事，依靠群众，没有克服不了的困难，没有解决不了的问题。因而工作和劳动热情越来越高，许多生产队的干部在最近二十天里，就作了一、二十个劳动日。他们不仅与群众商量，带领群众生产，还进食堂、下伙房，领导与帮助社员安排好冬季生活，认真执行休假制度，做到有劳有逸，领导社员更好地开展各项备耕工作。
