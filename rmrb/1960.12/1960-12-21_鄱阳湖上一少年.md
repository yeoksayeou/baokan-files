    A Youth on Poyang Lake
    Chen Sili, Greening Mountain Reclamation Farm, Yugan, Jiangxi
    Poyang Lake, when full of water, is a boundless sea; but, in the dry season, apart from the center of the lake, Poyang Lake is a vast grassland. One afternoon during this dry season, I was walking on Poyang Lake, where the grass was knee-deep, looking for the production team's temporary residence – a thatched shed. After walking for several hours, I only occasionally startled a flock of ducks, which emerged from the puddles in the grass and flew away whistling, but I didn't see a single person. Suddenly, I heard a faint sound of grass cutting, "嚓嚓嚓," coming from the distant grass on the right. I immediately stopped and carefully searched in that direction, while also coughing loudly. At that moment, a teenager, straightened up in the grass, and seeing me, ran quickly towards me. His face was rosy, his smile was amiable, and a lock of curly hair fell down, often covering his watery eyes. He sized me up and asked:
  "Hey, comrade, where are you going?"
    When he found out where I wanted to go, he jumped up with joy: "Ah, it's almost there, come on, sit here for a while, I'll go with you in a moment."
    As he spoke, he pulled my sleeve and dragged me to where he was cutting grass. He pointed to a pile of bundled lake grass and told me to sit down, saying, "Wait a little longer, I'll cut a full load and we'll go together."
    I quickly grew fond of this young man; he was so enthusiastic and cheerful, as if he had known me somewhere before. As he spoke, he quickly picked up his grass knife and started cutting grass again. His sturdy, dark little arms swung the grass knife with exceptional neatness and precision.
    In a short while, I was on my way with my newfound little companion. The sun was gone, and dark clouds were gathering in the western sky, looking like a big storm was brewing. I was a little anxious, but my little friend didn't seem to care at all. He carried a load of lake grass and chatted with me: "You're a transferred cadre, right?"
    "Yeah," I replied absentmindedly.
      "I'm also a transferred cadre."
    "What?" I paid attention.
    "From the first half of the year, I wanted to come to Poyang Lake with my dad, but the teacher wouldn't let me. This time I've been transferred to my dad's place!"
    I was intrigued by his words and deliberately teased him, "Why did you ask to be transferred? Are you reluctant to leave your dad?"
    "No! What are you talking about!" My little friend seemed a little unhappy. "What's there to be reluctant about leaving my dad? I like agriculture. I've been watching cattle and cutting grass since I was little. Not long ago, I heard Secretary Lü broadcast that we should plant all of Poyang Lake with grain, and I was very happy. You know, I not only love agriculture, but I also love large-scale agriculture!"
    "Ah! What is large-scale agriculture?"
    "You don't know? Hey, large-scale agriculture is driving a tractor! It would be great to drive a tractor in Poyang Lake. You wouldn't fall even with your eyes closed. I've mentioned it to my dad several times that I want to learn to drive a tractor, but my dad always says I'm too young and they won't want me, I have to wait."
    After a pause, my little companion shifted the load on his shoulder and continued, "Right now, we're competing with the Xinhe Commune to see who can complete the task of accumulating 10,000 loads of lake grass for fertilizer first. Our wheat is waiting for the lake grass, and yesterday my dad and I sowed a plot of wheat!"
    A violent gust of wind pressed over the long cogongrass, and the torrential rain finally poured down before we reached our destination. Just as I was at a loss, my little companion pointed to a few thatched sheds in the distance and said, "Run quickly, those thatched huts ahead are it."
    With that, he left me and, carrying the grass, ran straight to a newly reclaimed field on the left. The dense rain fell rapidly, and I covered my head with a straw mat. When I was momentarily stunned by the storm, which can only be encountered at Poyang Lake, I saw my little companion, unconcerned, quickly spreading the lake grass on the field under the beating of the rain. Just as I was about to run over to help him spread the grass, he quickly turned around and shouted, "Why aren't you going yet—, I'll finish spreading it soon, and come over right away—"
    I quickly ran into the thatched hut in front, and immediately found the branch secretary, and handed him the letter of introduction. The branch secretary, who was already wearing a raincoat, holding a bamboo hat in his left hand, and a shovel in his right, seemed a little apologetic after reading the letter of introduction and said to me, "Take a rest, comrade, I have to go and see the plot of land where we just sowed the wheat."
    My little companion just happened to burst in at that moment, soaked to the skin, and pouted at the branch secretary, saying, "See, I told you it would rain, but you didn't believe me! Luckily, I cut the grass, and the land is covered with grass, so you don't need to go."
    The branch secretary patted him affectionately and said, "Okay, okay, I know, go and change your clothes quickly, you look like a water ghost!"
    But my little companion didn't wait for the branch secretary to finish, snatched the bamboo hat from his hand, turned around and ran out again, saying as he ran:
  "No, Dad, I still have to go and see the experimental vegetables we planted the day before yesterday."
    The branch secretary hurried to pull him back, but the child ran too fast and he couldn't catch him. He sighed helplessly, "Oh, this little fellow!"
    The branch secretary and I walked out together, watching the back of this little fellow as he dashed towards the vegetable field. Soon, a newly rising wind blew from the north, driving the clouds eastward, and in the distance, half of the sun was still stuck to the lake shore. An arc-shaped rainbow stretched across the sky, crossing the grassland and gullies, and landing on the blue Poyang Lake on the other shore. Its colorful, radiant light was pouring down on my little companion, illuminating his wet back with splendor, brilliance, and dazzling light.

    鄱阳湖上一少年
    江西余干绿化山垦殖场　陈思立
    鄱阳湖在水满的日子里，是个浩瀚无边的大海；可是，干枯季节的鄱阳湖，除了湖中心以外，四周是一片茫茫的大草原。就在这干枯季节的一天下午，我在草齐膝深的鄱阳湖上走着，去寻找生产队的临时驻地——茅棚。走了几个钟头，只是偶然惊起一群水鸭，从草丛中的水洼里钻出来，呼哨飞去，却没见一个人影。突然，我听见右边远远的草丛里，好像响起一阵“嚓嚓嚓”的轻微刈草声。我立刻站下来，仔细地向那边搜寻，同时重重地咳了一声。就在这时，一个十几岁的少年，在草丛里直起身子，看到我，就飞快向我这边跑了过来。他脸色红润，笑容可掬，一绺卷曲的头发搭落下来，常常遮住了他那水汪汪的眼睛。他端详着我，问：
  “喂，同志，你到哪里去？”
    当他知道我要去的地方时，高兴得跳起来：“啊，快到了，来，你到这里坐一会，我等下和你一齐去。”
    他一面说，一面牵着我的衫袖就往他刈草的地方拉。他指着一堆捆好了的湖草叫我坐下说：“你再等一会，我刈满了一担就一块走。”
    我很快就爱上了这个少年，他是那样地热情、愉快，好像早就在哪里认识了我似的。他一面说着话，一面连忙又拾起草刀刈起草来。结实、黝黑的小手臂，挥舞着草刀，显得异常地干净、利落。
    只一会儿功夫，我就和我这个邂逅的小伴侣一同上路了。太阳不见了，西边天上堆聚起乌云，看样子，好像要起大风暴了。我有些发急，但我的小伙伴却一点也不在乎。他挑着一担湖草和我攀谈起来：“你是下放的吧？”
    “嗯。”我无心地应了一句。
      “我也是下放的。”
    “什么？”我注意了起来。
    “打上半年起，我就要和爸爸到鄱阳湖来，可老师不肯，这回我可下放到爸爸这里了！”
    我被他的话吸引住了，故意逗他道：“你为什么要求下放呢，是舍不得爸爸吧？”
    “不！这是哪里的话！”我的小伙伴似乎有点不太高兴。“我有什么舍不得爸爸，我是喜欢农业，俺点点儿大就看牛、刈草，前不久，我听见吕书记广播，说要把鄱阳湖都种上粮食，我就高兴得很，你不知道，我不但爱农业，我还爱大农业！”
    “啊！什么叫大农业？”
    “你不知道？哎，大农业就是开拖拉机嘛！要在鄱阳湖里开拖拉机真是好，闭着眼睛也不会跌跤，我几次都向爸爸提过，要去学开拖拉机，可爸爸却老说我年纪小了，人家不会要，得等一等。”
    停了一下，我的小伴侣把担子转了一个肩，接着说：“眼下我们正和信河公社比赛哩，看谁先完成一万担湖草的积肥任务，我们的小麦正等着要下湖草，我昨天也和爸爸俩播下了一块小麦哩！”
    一阵剧烈的狂风，压过长长的灯芯草盖了过来，暴雨终于不等我们到达目的地就倾盆而下了。就在我不知所措的时候，我的小伴侣指着不远处几栋茅棚的地方说：“你快跑，前面那几处茅屋就是。”
    说完，他就撇开我，挑着草，一直奔向左边一块新开垦的地里去了。密集的暴雨，急促地沙沙而下，我靠着一床草席遮住头。当我一时被这只有在鄱阳湖才碰得到的狂雨吓呆了的时候，我却看见我的小伴侣，毫不在乎地在疾雨的鞭打下，迅速地将湖草向那块地上铺开。我正想跑到那边去帮助他铺草时，他却连忙回过头来喊道：“你还不快去——，我就铺完了，马上就来——”
    我很快就跑进了前面的茅屋，立刻找到了支部书记，把介绍信交给了他。支部书记这时正穿好了蓑衣，左手拿着斗笠，右手握着铁锹，看过介绍信后似乎有些抱歉似地对我说：“你休息一下，同志，我得去看看刚播了小麦的那块地去。”
    我的小伙伴刚好就在这当口闯了进来，全身湿淋淋，冲着支部书记就噘着嘴说：“是吧，我说了会下雨嘛，你不信哩，还好，我刈了草来，地都铺上草啦，你不要去了。”
    支部书记爱抚地拍了拍他，说：“好啦，好啦，知道了，赶快去换衣裳吧，像一个水鬼！”
    但我的小伙伴却不等支部书记说完，就抢了他手中的斗笠一转身又钻了出去，一边跑，一边说：
  “不，爸爸，我还得去看看前天栽的试验菜呢。”
    支部书记赶忙去拉他，但是孩子跑得太快，使他没有捞着。他无可奈何地叹口气说：“哎，这小家伙！”
    我和支部书记同时走了出来，望着这个小家伙向菜地里飞奔而去的背影。很快，从北面吹过来一阵新起的风，把云赶往东去，远远的还有半边太阳贴在湖边上，一条弧形的虹，横跨天际，自草原越过河汊，落在青蓝的鄱阳湖彼岸。它的彩色四射的光芒，正倾泻在我那小伙伴的身上，把他的湿漉漉的背影，映照得辉煌艳丽，灿烂夺目。
