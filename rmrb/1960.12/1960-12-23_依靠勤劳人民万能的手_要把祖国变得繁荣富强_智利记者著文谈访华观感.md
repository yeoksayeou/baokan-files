The Chilean newspaper *El Siglo* published an article on November 25 by reporter Francisco Javier Nerra, discussing his impressions of visiting China.

The article stated that we visited major regions of China for thirty-six days and witnessed the creative labor of industrious people with omnipotent hands, who are building their motherland into a prosperous and strong nation. The People's Government, in just eleven years since its founding, has lifted over one hundred million people out of illiteracy, established hundreds of thousands of schools in remote areas across the country, and is developing agriculture in a direction that benefits the collective.

The author said that we were pleased to see the Chinese people visiting the Summer Palace in Beijing, Tiger Hill in Suzhou, and the picturesque gardens of Hangzhou. In short, everything in China belongs to the people.

    依靠勤劳人民万能的手
    要把祖国变得繁荣富强
    智利记者著文谈访华观感
  智利《世纪报》11月25日刊登了记者弗朗西斯科·哈维尔·内拉写的一篇文章，谈到访问我国的观感。
    文章说，我们在中国各主要地区访问了三十六天，看到长着一双万能的手的勤劳的人民的创造性的劳动，正在把自己的祖国变得繁荣富强起来。人民政府仅仅成立十一年，就使一亿多人口摆脱了文盲状况，它在全国各偏僻地方开办了数十万所学校，建立了工业，农业的方针是朝着有利于集体的方向发展。
    作者说，我们高兴地看到中国人民在北京的颐和园，苏州的虎丘和杭州风景如画的园林游览。总而言之，在中国一切都归人民所有。
