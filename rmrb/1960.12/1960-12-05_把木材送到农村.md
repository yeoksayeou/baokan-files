Editorial Note:

    Sending Timber to the Countryside
    Currently, agricultural tools (including improved agricultural tools) are mainly made of wood or a mixture of iron and wood. The demand for timber for agricultural tools is very high. A simple "Liling No. 2" rice transplanter requires half a cubic meter of timber, a rubber-tired cart requires 0.8 cubic meters of timber, and the dragon-bone waterwheels used for irrigation in the South are entirely made of wood, requiring even more timber. Although small agricultural tools such as wooden forks, wooden rakes, hoes, and shovels do not use much timber, they are indispensable. Among the timber used for agricultural tools, some of it is of good quality and has strong compressive resistance and wear resistance, such as the axles and carriage panels used in horse-drawn carts, and the ship timber used in wooden sailboats.

    Therefore, as various localities are taking advantage of the winter to repair and manufacture agricultural tools, forestry industrial departments, forest areas, and people's communes in mountainous areas should plan to produce a batch of timber to support the countryside. This is an important aspect of the forestry industry supporting agriculture.

    把木材送到农村
    当前农具（包括改良农具）主要还是木制和铁木混制的。农具对木材的需要量很大。一部醴陵二号简易式水稻插秧机，要用半立方米木材，一部胶轮马车要用零点八立方米木材，南方灌田用的龙式水车，全部是木制的，需用的木材就更多了。木叉、木铣、锄、锹等小农具，所用的木材虽然不多，但没有也不行。在农具用的木材中，有一部分是质地好和抗压、耐磨性较强的，如马车所用的车轴和车箱板材，木帆船所用的船材等。
    因此，当此各地利用冬季修造农具之际，森林工业部门、林区和山区人民公社，要有计划地生产一批木材支援农村。这是森林工业支援农业的重要内容之一。
