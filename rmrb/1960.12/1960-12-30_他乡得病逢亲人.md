	Finding Kin After Falling Ill in a Foreign Land

	I work at the E’kou Iron Mine Hospital of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company. In November, I went on a business trip to Taikang County, Henan Province. On the day of my return, my bronchitis suddenly relapsed. Because I had official business to attend to, I was anxious to get home; but after walking only two or three li, I couldn't hold on any longer. At this time, an old lady from Yangmiao Township People's Commune quickly helped me to stay at a nearby canteen. A comrade from the canteen named Zhang Qingwei sacrificed his rest time to find a doctor for me. The secretary of the brigade's Party branch also came to ask after me and told me to rest well and return to Shanxi after I recovered. Director Yao of the Yangmiao Township People's Commune also came to see me. What was particularly touching was that the surrounding villagers also came to ask about my condition. An old lady, fearing that I was cold, brought me a cotton quilt; fearing that I was hungry, she brought me food to eat.

	Under their careful care, I recovered in a few days. Through this incident, I deeply realized that under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, our people across the country are united like a family, and everywhere is a warm home!

    他乡得病逢亲人
    我在太原钢铁公司峨口铁矿医院工作。11月份，因公出差到河南太康县。回来的那天，我的支气管炎突然复发了。因为公事在身，我就急着赶回家；可是刚走了二、三里路，就支持不住了。这时，杨庙乡人民公社一位老大娘，连忙把我扶到附近食堂住下。食堂的一位名叫张清渭的同志，牺牲自己的休息时间，给我找来医生。大队党支部书记也赶来向我问好，并叫我好好休息，等病好了再回山西。杨庙乡人民公社姚主任也赶来看我。特别令人感动的是，周围的老乡们也来问长问短。有一个老大娘怕我冷，还给我送来了棉被；怕我饿，又送饭给我吃。
    在他们细心照顾下，没几天我的病就好了。通过这件事，我深深体会到在党和毛主席领导下，我们全国人民团结得真像一家人一样，到处都是温暖的家庭！山西太钢峨口铁矿医院　周坤伦
