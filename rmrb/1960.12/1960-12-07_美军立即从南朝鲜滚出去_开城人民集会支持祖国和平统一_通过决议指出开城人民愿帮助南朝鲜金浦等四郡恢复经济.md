Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 5th: According to reports in local newspapers today, 50,000 people in Kaesong held a mass rally on the 4th, shouting slogans of "U.S. troops get out of South Korea immediately!" to support the documents passed by the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea to promote the peaceful reunification of the fatherland and realize a North-South federation.

A resolution passed by the meeting warmly supported the recent documents passed by the Supreme People's Assembly regarding the promotion of peaceful reunification. The resolution stated that in order to help the four counties of Gimpo, Jangdan, Paju, and Ganghwa in South Korea, which are adjacent to Kaesong, restore their devastated economies and rescue the people's livelihoods, the people of Kaesong are willing to donate 400,000 straw bags (each bag weighing 60 kilograms) of grain and 50,000 sets of clothing from their surplus grain, and to ensure that the people of these four counties receive an average of 15 meters of cloth and other necessities per person. In addition, the people of Kaesong are also willing to provide labor and funds to help these four counties complete irrigation, electrification, and mechanization projects, build 120 schools and 120 hospitals, as well as factories, houses, cinemas, etc.

At the rally, Wu Jae-ryong, Chairman of the Kaesong City Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, and representatives from all walks of life spoke. In his speech, Wu Jae-ryong pointed out that the specific measures recently proposed by the Supreme People's Assembly to promote peaceful reunification and realize a North-South federation have illuminated the prospects for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland for the Korean people. He emphasized that revitalizing the bankrupt South Korean economy and saving the South Korean people from hunger and poverty will open a new chapter in the history of the Korean nation. Kim Kwang-jin, a representative of the workers from the Kaesong General Machinery Factory, said at the meeting that the Korean issue must be resolved by the Korean people themselves. Kaesong took the road to bankruptcy in the past when it relied on American "aid," but in the few years after joining the embrace of the Republic, Kaesong has become a socialist city with more than 60 factories and enterprises, where everyone has a job and lives a happy life. He pointed out that today, only by relying on the strong economic foundation of North Korea can the bankrupt South Korean economy be revived and the South Korean people be rescued from hunger and poverty.

Kim Young-gye, a representative of the Songdo Agricultural Cooperative, said that ten years ago, when Kaesong was ruled by American imperialism and its lackeys, farmers worked excessively hard all year round, but in the end, even their seeds were taken away, and they had to leave their homes and wander around. Today, farmers in the Kaesong area cultivate the fields with tractors on land covered with irrigation networks, living a prosperous life that was unimaginable in the past. He said that the farmers in the Kaesong area are determined to undertake the construction of the irrigation projects in the aforementioned four counties. He expressed his conviction that the South Korean farmers will ignite the flames of the anti-American struggle for national salvation even higher, and the strength of the 30 million people combined will surely achieve the peaceful reunification of the fatherland.

    “美军立即从南朝鲜滚出去”
    开城人民集会支持祖国和平统一
    通过决议指出开城人民愿帮助南朝鲜金浦等四郡恢复经济
    新华社平壤5日电　据此间报纸今天报道，开城市五万人民4日在高呼“美军立即从南朝鲜滚出去”的口号声中举行群众大会，支持朝鲜最高人民会议为促进祖国的和平统一、实现南北联邦制而通过的文件。
    大会通过的一项决议热烈支持最高人民会议不久前通过的关于促进和平统一的文件。决议中说，开城人民为了帮助临近开城的南朝鲜金浦、长湍、坡州、江华四个郡恢复被破坏了的经济，救济人民生活，愿意从余粮中拿出四十万草袋（每草袋六十公斤）的粮食和五万套衣服，并且使这四个郡的人民平均每人可分得十五米的布匹等生活必需品。另外，开城人民还愿意提供劳动力和资金，帮助这四个郡完成水利化、电气化和机械化，为这四个郡建设一百二十所学校和一百二十所医院，另外还要帮助建设工厂、住宅、电影院等。
    在这次集会上，朝鲜劳动党开城市委员会委员长吴济龙和各界人民代表都讲了话。吴济龙在会上讲话时指出，最高人民会议最近提出的促进和平统一实现南北联邦制的具体措施，在朝鲜人民面前照亮了和平统一祖国的前景。他强调说，复兴处于破产状态的南朝鲜经济、从饥饿和贫穷中拯救南朝鲜人民，这将在朝鲜民族历史上开辟一个新的局面。开城综合机械厂工人代表金光镇在会上说，朝鲜问题必须由朝鲜人民自己来解决。开城市过去在依赖美国的“援助”的时候，走上了破产的道路，但开城在投入共和国怀抱后的几年内，变成了拥有六十多个工厂企业的社会主义城市，所有的人都有工作，都过着幸福的生活。他指出，今天只有依靠北朝鲜的强大的经济基础才能复兴遭到破产的南朝鲜经济，才能从饥饿和贫穷中拯救南朝鲜人民。
    松岛农业社社员代表金永桂说，十年前在美帝国主义及其走狗统治着开城时，农民们一年到头进行过重的劳动，但最后连种子也被夺去，农民们不得不离乡背井，四出流浪。而今天，开城地区的农民在布满着灌溉网的田地上用拖拉机耕作，过着过去无法想像的富裕生活。他说，开城地区的农民决心担任建设上述四个郡的灌溉工程。他表示确信，南朝鲜农民将更高地燃起反美救国斗争的火焰，三千万人民的力量汇合在一起，一定能达成祖国的和平统一。
