    Xinhua News Agency, Havana – Several peasant militia battalions in Oriente Province, Cuba, held a graduation ceremony in Santiago on the 20th. The militiamen paraded in the rain and solemnly swore at the meeting to resolutely defend the motherland. These militia battalions have undergone excellent training in preparation for repelling aggressors.
    Raúl Castro, Minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba, other government officials, and the famous Chilean poet Pablo Neruda attended the meeting. Raúl Castro said at the meeting that when a people takes up arms, their cause will never suffer defeat.
    He said: In the struggle against tyrannical rule, we have completely shattered those myths: that workers are incapable of leadership, that we cannot defeat regular armies, that we cannot defeat imperialism, and that we will starve without the Americans. He emphasized, "We have opposed imperialism and are defeating imperialism, and we are adhering to the revolution." He said that to adhere to the Cuban revolution, we must unite and make ourselves strong; we must raise ideological awareness and carry out the struggle to defend the motherland and the struggle for production.
    Chilean poet Pablo Neruda and Cuban poets recited passionate poems at the meeting, encouraging the Cuban militia to bravely resist the enemy and repel the aggression of U.S. imperialism.
    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, December 22 – Cuban representative to the Organization of American States, Carlos Lechuga, yesterday condemned the United States for demanding that the Council of the Organization of American States and the Latin American countries participating in the organization assist Cuban counter-revolutionaries in Florida, USA, as a sinister conspiracy to prepare for armed aggression against Cuba.
    This request for assistance was put forward by the U.S. representative to the Organization of American States, Philip Bonsal, the day before yesterday. When making the above request, he shamelessly declared that "the U.S. government will continue to take all necessary measures" to assist Cuban counter-revolutionaries with Florida as their main training base. As is well known, Eisenhower recently approved the allocation of one million U.S. dollars to support and train Cuban war criminals in Florida.
    Lechuga pointed out that the U.S.'s "conspiracy is clearly part of the movement to step up preparations for armed aggression against Cuba in recent months." Lechuga condemned the U.S. government for turning so-called Cuban refugees into propaganda material in Latin America and international organizations. He said they labeled all kinds of goods, such as war criminals, deserters, and traitors, as refugees. Lechuga pointed out that Florida has become a base for training war criminals and launching pirate aircraft to harass Cuba. War criminals and deserters are also being used by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency in military camps in the southern United States and Central America, and they are receiving U.S. dollar subsidies.

    劳尔·卡斯特罗在奥连特省民兵大会上说
    古巴人民团结一致坚持革命
    驻美洲国家组织代表谴责美国搜罗匪徒准备武装侵略
    据新华社哈瓦那讯　古巴奥连特省的几个农民民兵营20日在圣地亚哥举行结业大会。民兵们冒雨举行了列队游行，在大会上庄严宣誓坚决保卫祖国。这些民兵营为了准备好反击侵略者，进行了出色的训练。
    古巴革命武装部长劳尔·卡斯特罗、政府其他官员和著名智利诗人聂鲁达参加了这次大会。劳尔·卡斯特罗在大会上说，当一国人民拿起了武器的时候，他们的事业就永远不会遭受失败。
    他说：在反对暴政统治的斗争中，我们曾经使那些神话彻底破产：劳动者没有能力进行领导，我们不可能击溃正规军，我们不可能战胜帝国主义，没有美国人我们就会饿死。他强调说，“我们反对了帝国主义并且正在战胜帝国主义，我们坚持着革命。”他说：为了坚持古巴革命，应该团结一致，使我们坚强有力；应该提高思想觉悟，进行保卫祖国的斗争和生产斗争。
    智利诗人聂鲁达和古巴的诗人们在大会上朗诵了热情的诗篇，鼓励古巴民兵英勇抗敌，击退美帝国主义的侵略。
    新华社哈瓦那22日电　古巴驻美洲国家组织代表卡洛斯·莱丘加昨天谴责说，美国要求美洲国家组织理事会和参加这个组织的拉丁美洲各国援助在美国佛罗里达的古巴反革命分子是准备武装侵略古巴的一个罪恶阴谋。
    这个进行援助的要求是美国驻美洲国家组织代表菲利普·邦沙尔前天提出来的。他在提出上述要求时无耻地宣布，“美国政府将继续采取一切必要的措施”来援助以佛罗里达为主要训练基地的古巴反革命分子。如所周知，艾森豪威尔不久前已经批准拨款一百万美元用来豢养和训练在佛罗里达的古巴战争罪犯。
    莱丘加指出，美国的“这个阴谋显然是近几个月来加紧进行的准备对古巴实行武装侵略的运动的组成部分”。莱丘加谴责美国政府把所谓的古巴避难者变成了在整个拉丁美洲和国际组织中进行宣传的材料。他说，他们把战争罪犯、逃兵和叛徒等各种各样的货色都贴上了避难者的标签。莱丘加指出，佛罗里达变成了训练战争罪犯和骚扰古巴的海盗飞机起飞的基地。战争罪犯和逃兵还被美国中央情报局在美国南部和中美洲的军营中加以利用，他们正在领取美元津贴。（附图片）
