Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 7th: The Czechoslovakian newspaper "Red Right" published an editorial on December 7th entitled "Documents of World Historical Significance" regarding the declaration of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties.

    The editorial first pointed out that the declaration of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties has special significance and will be included in the most important programmatic documents of the international revolutionary workers' movement. It stated that this declaration further develops the basic issues raised in the 1957 Declaration and the Peace Manifesto in a comprehensive manner, and makes a profound, scientific, Marxist-Leninist analysis of the current world situation. It analyzes the basic issues of the revolutionary struggle for the future happiness of mankind. Therefore, it is a combat program of great international significance, a clear direction and universally significant guideline for the activities of all Communist and Workers' Parties, and a vivid call to unite all progressive forces in the struggle to safeguard world peace and thwart the war plans of the imperialists.

    The editorial stated that this document is a collective work of the entire communist movement, the result of the collective efforts of Communist and Workers' Parties, and a path that treats facts with the living spirit of Marxism-Leninism. The communist movement has forged new and powerful weapons for itself, which will multiply the strength of the communist movement.

    The editorial stated that today, the international communist movement is the most influential political force of our time. It stands at the forefront of the people's struggle for progress and continues to move forward. The creative development of Marxist-Leninist thought embodied in the declaration is a firm guide for the communist movement to move towards new and victorious struggles.

    The editorial emphasized that the unity and unbreakable solidarity of the communist ranks are the basic prerequisites for the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries and the world communist movement to play their world-historical role. Especially today, when the imperialist reactionaries are trying their best to unite their forces in the struggle against communism, the ideological consistency, unity of will and action, and internationalist solidarity of the entire communist movement have become extremely important. Consolidating this unity—the declaration itself is its embodiment—will increase the strength of the world communist movement tenfold and is a reliable guarantee of its victorious advance. -- The ideological consistency of the communist ranks is first formed in the struggle against bourgeois ideology and various anti-Leninist factions. In the past few years, the Communist Parties have ideologically crushed the revisionists who attempted to lead the Communist Party away from the path of Marxism-Leninism in their own ranks. While opposing revisionism as the main danger, manifestations of dogmatism and sectarianism must be overcome in the communist ranks, and a resolute struggle must be continued on both fronts.

    The editorial then stated that, contrary to all the wishful thinking of the enemies, the unity of the entire communist movement has always been further deepened in the struggle against all non-Marxist views. The parties' views on the current situation and the prospects for human development are consistent.

    When discussing the new phenomena of the current era, the editorial pointed out that the world socialist system has become a decisive factor in the development of human society. This is primarily due to its entry into a new stage of development. The declaration states: "The Soviet Union is victoriously building a comprehensive communist society. Other countries in the socialist camp are victoriously laying the foundations of socialism, and some of them have entered the period of building an advanced socialist society. Socialism has achieved decisive victories throughout its system." The editorial pointed out that the time is approaching when the socialist camp will also occupy the first place in the world's production share.

    The editorial then stated that, in stark contrast to the rapid rise of the socialist system, a profound process of decline and collapse is sweeping the capitalist system. The class and national antagonisms of capitalist society, as well as internal and external contradictions, have greatly intensified. The economic instability of capitalism is growing. At the same time, the decay of capitalism is most evident in the leading country of modern imperialism—the United States. The United States has become the largest international exploiter, the main stronghold of world reaction, and the international gendarme. All this and a series of other factors prove that a new stage in the general crisis of capitalism has begun.

    When discussing the issue of war, the editorial stated that the communists, holding high the banner of peace, once again appeal to the world: War is not inevitably determined! Because of the enormous growth of socialism in the world, imperialism can no longer launch wars at will. The people's struggle for peace in all countries can effectively prevent the danger of war. The editorial then stated that, of course, this does not change the fact that as long as imperialism—whose aggressive nature has not changed—exists, the soil for war still exists, and the threat of a new world war has not yet been eliminated. Therefore, the struggle for peace requires the people of all countries to maintain the highest vigilance against the aggressive attempts of the imperialists.

    The editorial pointed out that socialist countries thoroughly pursue a policy of peaceful coexistence. This policy is now and will continue to be the unshakable foundation of their foreign policy. This policy is in line with the fundamental interests of the people of all countries. The Moscow meeting unanimously emphasized the historical significance of the comprehensive and complete disarmament program proposed by the Soviet Union. The working people realize that achieving this program is not an easy task. However, they will therefore fight more resolutely for the realization of the program.

    When discussing the world national liberation struggle, the editorial stated that the national liberation struggle is now taking place in vast areas of the world. In a short historical period, the result will be the complete bankruptcy of colonialism. In terms of its historical significance, the collapse of the colonial slavery system is the most important phenomenon after the emergence of the world socialist system. The imperialists, led by the United States, are desperately trying to preserve colonial exploitation with new methods and new forms. But these efforts are met with growing resistance. More countries have gained political independence and are striving for economic independence. The significance of these countries in the development of international events is constantly increasing, and they are an important part of the world front for peace. The people of liberated countries—first and foremost the exploited masses led by the working class—are looking for answers to urgent social problems and the consolidation of national independence.

    When discussing the revolutionary struggle of the people in capitalist countries, the editorial stated that the Marxist-Leninist parties stand at the forefront of the struggle of the working class and the working people to achieve socialist revolution and establish the dictatorship of the proletariat. The dictatorship of the proletariat means a permanent break with the formalism of bourgeois democracy, meaning guaranteeing the real rights and freedoms of the working people. The working class and its vanguard Marxist-Leninist parties strive to achieve socialist revolution through peaceful means, which is in the interests of the entire people. But if the exploiting classes resort to violence against the people, then capitalism must be overthrown through other, non-peaceful means.

    The editorial finally emphasized that consolidating the unity of the Communist Parties on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism is the most important condition and guarantee for the world communist and workers' movement to achieve new victories in the great struggle for a bright future for all mankind, for peace and the victory of socialism. Resolutely defend this unity, do not allow any actions that could undermine this unity, but instead continue to consolidate and develop this unity—this is one of the basic laws of the further upsurge of the communist movement.

    Our party, together with the entire people of our country, will transform the great ideas of the declaration into concrete actions in building an advanced socialist society and fighting for peace in the consolidation and development of our socialist country.

    具有世界历史意义的文献
    捷克斯洛伐克《红色权利报》12月7日社论摘要
    新华社布拉格7日电　捷克斯洛伐克《红色权利报》7日就各国共产党和工人党代表会议声明发表了题为《具有世界历史意义的文献》的社论。
    社论首先指出，各国共产党和工人党代表会议声明具有特殊的意义，它将被列入国际革命工人运动最重要的纲领性文献之中。它说，这一声明进一步全面发挥了1957年的宣言和和平宣言中所提出的基本问题，并且对目前世界局势作了深刻的科学的马克思列宁主义的分析，它分析了争取人类幸福未来的革命斗争的基本问题，因而它是具有巨大国际意义的战斗纲领，是各共产党和工人党的活动的明确方向和具有普遍意义的方针，是对在争取世界和平、挫败帝国主义者的战争计划的斗争中联合一切进步力量的生动的号召。
    社论说，这一文件是整个共产主义运动的集体著作，是共产党和工人党集体努力的成果，是以活生生的马克思列宁主义精神对待事实的门径。共产主义运动为自己铸造了新的强有力的武器，它将使共产主义运动的力量倍增。
    社论说，今天，国际共产主义运动是我们时代的最有影响的政治力量。它站在人民争取进步的斗争的前列、不断向前迈进。声明中所体现的马克思列宁主义思想的创造性发展，是共产主义运动走向新的和胜利的斗争的坚定的指南。
    社论着重指出，共产党人的队伍的统一和牢不可破的团结，是各国共产党和工人党及世界共产主义运动能够起到自己的世界历史性作用的基本前提。特别是在今天，当帝国主义反动派竭力在反对共产主义的斗争中将自己的力量联合起来的时候，整个共产主义运动的思想一致，意志和行动的一致及国际主义团结就成为极其重要的了。巩固这种团结一致——声明本身就是它的体现——将使世界共产主义运动的力量得到十倍的增长，并且是它胜利前进的可靠保证。——共产党人的队伍的思想一致首先是在同资产阶级思想及形形色色的反列宁主义的流派作斗争的过程中形成的。在过去几年中，各共产党在自己的队伍中从思想上粉碎了企图使共产党离开马克思列宁主义道路的修正主义者。在反对作为主要危险的修正主义的同时，在共产党人的队伍中必须克服教条主义和宗派主义的表现，并在两个战线上继续进行坚决的斗争。
    社论接着说，与敌人的一切妄想相反，在反对所有非马克思主义观点的斗争中，整个共产主义运动的团结一向都达到进一步的加深。各党对当前局势和人类发展远景的观点是一致的。
    社论在谈到当前时代的新现象时指出，世界社会主义体系已成为人类社会发展的决定性因素。这首先是由于它进入了自己发展的新阶段。声明说：“苏联正在胜利地全面建设共产主义社会。社会主义阵营的其它国家正在胜利地奠定社会主义的基础，其中某些国家已经进入发达的社会主义社会的建设时期。社会主义在它的整个体系的范围内，取得了决定性的胜利。”社论指出，社会主义阵营在世界生产比重方面也将占据首位的时期临近了。
    社论接着说，与社会主义体系的急剧高涨完全相反，深刻的衰落和崩溃过程席卷着资本主义体系。资本主义社会阶级和民族的对立，及内部和外部的矛盾大大地加剧了。资本主义的经济不稳定在增长，同时，资本主义的腐朽最明显地表现在现代帝国主义的主要国家--美国里。美国成了最大的国际剥削者及世界反动派的主要堡垒和国际宪兵。这一切及一系列其它因素都证明，资本主义总危机发展中的新阶段开始了。
    社论在谈到战争问题时说，高举和平旗帜的共产党人，再次向全世界呼吁：战争不是决定不可避免的！因为社会主义在世界上的巨大增长，帝国主义已经不能一意孤行地发动战争。各国人民的和平斗争能够有效地防止战争危险。社论接着说，当然，这丝毫也不改变这一事实：只要有帝国主义--它的侵略性质没有改变--存在，也就仍然存在着战争的土壤，新的世界大战的威胁就仍未斩除。因此，争取和平的斗争要求各国人民对帝国主义者的侵略企图保持最高的警惕性。
    社论指出，社会主义国家彻底奉行和平共处的政策。这一政策现在和将来都是它们的外交政策的不可动摇的基础。这种政策符合世界各国人民的根本利益。莫斯科会议一致强调了苏联提出的全面彻底裁军纲领的历史意义。劳动人民意识到，实现这个纲领不是件容易的事情。但是，他们因此将要为纲领的实现进行更坚决地斗争。
    社论在谈到世界民族解放斗争时说，现在民族解放斗争正在世界的广大地区进行着，在短短的历史时期内，其结果将是殖民主义的全部破产。就其历史意义来说，殖民主义奴役制度的崩溃是继世界社会主义体系产生之后的最重要的现象。以美国为首的帝国主义者绝望地企图用新方法和新形式保存殖民主义的剥削。但这些努力遭到不断增长的反抗。又有一些国家取得政治独立，并在为经济独立而努力。这些国家在国际事件发展中的意义不断增加，它们是争取和平的世界战线的重要组成部分。解放了的国家的人民--首先是以工人阶级为首的被剥削的群众--在寻找对迫切的社会问题和巩固民族独立的问题的答案。
    社论在谈到资本主义国家人民的革命斗争时说，马克思列宁主义政党站在工人阶级、劳动人民为实现社会主义革命、建立无产阶级专政而作的斗争的前列。无产阶级专政意味着永远与资产阶级的形式主义的民主的决裂，意味着保障劳动人民的真正权利和自由。工人阶级及其先锋队马克思列宁主义政党，努力通过和平的道路实现社会主义革命，这是符合全体人民的利益的。但是假若剥削阶级采取暴力反对人民，那就要通过其他的、非和平的道路推翻资本主义。
    社论最后着重指出，在马克思列宁主义、无产阶级国际主义的基础上巩固各共产党的团结，是世界共产主义和工人运动在争取全人类的光明未来、争取和平和社会主义胜利的伟大斗争中取得新的胜利的最重要的条件和保证。坚决保卫这种团结，不允许任何能够破坏这种团结的行动，相反要继续巩固和发展这种团结，--这是共产主义运动进一步高涨的基本法则之一。
    我们的党将同我国全体人民一起，在我们社会主义国家的巩固和发展中，把声明的伟大思想变为建设发达的社会主义社会和争取和平斗争中的具体行动。
