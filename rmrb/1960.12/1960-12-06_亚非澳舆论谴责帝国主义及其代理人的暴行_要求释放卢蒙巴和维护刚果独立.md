    Xinhua News Agency, December 5th: Public opinion in various African, Asian, and Australian countries has condemned the U.S. and other imperialists for colluding with their puppets in the Congo to kidnap Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba and demanded his immediate release.
    Moroccan newspaper *Al Alam* published an editorial on December 4th entitled "Africa's Task," calling on all African countries to support and protect Lumumba.
    The editorial stated that since the Congo declared independence, the country's security has been threatened by American and Belgian imperialism. The imperialists orchestrated a series of rebellions and violent actions in the Congo. They supported separatists and agents. The new conspiracy created by the imperialists was to instruct Kasavubu to announce the "deposition" of Lumumba. After the failure of this imperialist conspiracy, they then supported another agent, Mobutu.
    The editorial said, "We demand the release of Lumumba, protect his safety, and allow him to continue serving as the legitimate leader of the Congo."
    All Arabic newspapers in Cairo, the capital of the United Arab Republic, published commentaries on the Congolese situation on December 4th and demanded that the United Nations protect Lumumba.
    *Al Akhbar* said, "The 'United Nations forces' must not overturn the fact that: if the United Nations forces were not in the Congo, Lumumba would not have been arrested, people like Mobutu and Tshombe would not have gained power, and Belgian forces and influence could not have returned to the Congo under the guise of experts and technicians, and rule the Congo through their puppets."
    The "Voice of the Algerian Republic" radio station broadcast on December 4th, pointing out that Western imperialists are using United Nations forces in the Congo to achieve their despicable goals.
    The radio station emphasized that world public opinion condemns the position taken by Western imperialists in the Congo and demands that the Congolese issue be resolved on the basis of national unity, freedom, and independence.
    The radio station said that the events in the Congo provide a lesson for the people of all countries, and they must learn these lessons in order to more effectively fight against imperialism.
    On the same day, the Israeli newspaper *Kol HaAm* angrily condemned in an editorial entitled "Release Patrice Lumumba," saying that "the kidnapping and imprisonment of Lumumba by Mobutu and his gang of murderers is a sinful act of violence that has aroused the anger and just indignation of honest and freedom-loving people everywhere."
    The editorial said that Hammaskjöld bears the primary responsibility for Mobutu's emergence as a dictator, as he undertook the task of replacing the Belgians with American-NATO neo-colonialists. Hammarskjöld's demand that Mobutu treat Lumumba "mercifully" is disgusting hypocrisy. Hammarskjöld appears to be intervening on behalf of Lumumba, but is actually strengthening the position of the usurper Mobutu.
    The Australian *Sydney Sun* pointed out in an editorial on the 5th that the United Nations "will not be very proud of the role it is playing in the Congo events now unfolding." The newspaper condemned the United Nations authorities for supporting the Mobutu group's recklessness in the Congo.

### 亚非澳舆论谴责帝国主义及其代理人的暴行  要求释放卢蒙巴和维护刚果独立

    亚非澳舆论谴责帝国主义及其代理人的暴行
    要求释放卢蒙巴和维护刚果独立
    据新华社5日讯　非洲、亚洲和澳大利亚各国舆论纷纷谴责美国等帝国主义者勾结他们在刚果的傀儡绑架刚果合法总理卢蒙巴，并要求立即释放他。
    摩洛哥《旗帜报》4日发表题为《非洲的任务》的社论，呼吁一切非洲国家支持卢蒙巴和保护他。
    社论说，在刚果宣布独立以后，这个国家的安全就受到美国和比利时帝国主义的威胁。帝国主义者在刚果策划了一系列的叛乱和暴力行动。他们扶植分裂主义者和代理人。帝国主义者制造的新阴谋，就是指使卡萨武布宣布“废黜”卢蒙巴。在帝国主义者的这项阴谋失败以后，他们接着又扶植了另一个代理人蒙博托。
    社论说，“我们要求释放卢蒙巴，保护他的安全，并让他继续担任刚果的合法领导。”
    阿联首都开罗的所有阿拉伯报纸4日都就刚果局势发表评论，并要求联合国保护卢蒙巴。
    《消息报》说，“联合国军”决不能推翻这一事实：“如果联合国军不在刚果的话，卢蒙巴也不会被捕，像蒙博托和冲伯这样的人也不会得势，比利时的势力和影响就不能在专家和技术人员的掩饰下回到刚果，并通过他们的傀儡来统治刚果。”
    《阿尔及利亚共和国之声》电台4日的广播指出，西方帝国主义利用在刚果的联合国部队来达到自己的卑鄙目的。
    电台强调指出，世界舆论谴责西方帝国主义者在刚果所采取的立场，并要求在刚果国家统一、自由和独立的基础上来解决刚果问题。
    电台说，刚果的事件给予各国人民以教训，他们必须吸取这些教训，才能更有效地同帝国主义进行斗争。
    同一天，以色列《人民呼声报》在题为《释放帕特里斯·卢蒙巴》的社论中愤怒谴责说，“蒙博托这伙凶手们绑架和囚禁卢蒙巴，是罪恶的暴力行动，它激起了各地正直的和爱好自由的人们的愤怒和正当的愤慨。”
    社论说，蒙博托得以独裁者的姿态出现，其主要责任在于哈马舍尔德，他承担了使美国—北大西洋公约组织新殖民主义者代替比利时人的任务。哈马舍尔德要求蒙博托“仁慈地”对待卢蒙巴是一种令人作呕的假仁假义。哈马舍尔德表面上好像是为卢蒙巴出面干预，实际上是在加强篡权者蒙博托的地位。
    澳大利亚《悉尼太阳报》5日在社论中指出，联合国“对于它在现在正在发展的刚果事件中所起的作用，不会很光彩的”。这家报纸谴责联合国当局支持蒙博托集团在刚果胡作非为。
