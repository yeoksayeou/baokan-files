Xinhua News Agency, December 15th, New York (TASS dispatch, December 14th): The UN General Assembly plenary session on December 14th concluded its discussion of the Soviet-proposed Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.

    This discussion began on November 28th. During the session, the Soviet government proposed a draft declaration demanding that all colonial countries, trust territories, and other non-self-governing territories be granted complete independence and freedom immediately, in accordance with the freely expressed will and desires of their people. The draft stipulated the complete elimination of the colonial system and all forms of colonial administrative bodies, the abolition of all colonial strongholds such as territories and leased lands in other countries, and called on all governments to consistently and strictly adhere to the principles of equality, respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries in international relations.

    Forty-three Asian and African countries (originally twenty-five, later increasing to forty-three) also put forward a draft declaration proposing immediate measures to grant governing power to the people of trust territories, non-self-governing territories, or other territories that have not yet achieved independence. This draft declaration contained a series of principled arguments from the Soviet draft. The draft also pointed out that any attempt to undermine national unity and national territorial integrity is intolerable.

    The Soviet Union proposed amendments to the declaration draft of the forty-three Asian and African countries, stipulating that the deadline for granting independence to colonial peoples should be no later than the end of next year, and that the implementation of this resolution should be discussed at the 16th session of the United Nations General Assembly.

    The General Assembly first voted separately on the Soviet draft declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. The substantive part of the declaration was rejected by a margin of three votes (35 votes to 32, with 30 abstentions). Socialist countries and the majority of Asian and African countries voted in favor of this part. Western countries mainly voted against it. Twenty-five delegations voted in favor of the other parts of the Soviet declaration draft, forty-three delegations voted against, and twenty-nine delegations abstained.

    Subsequently, the Soviet amendment to the Asian-African proposal was voted on, and the Soviet amendment was not adopted.

    The draft declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, proposed by Asian and African countries, was adopted with ninety votes in favor. Only a small number of countries' delegations abstained, namely the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Australia, Spain, Portugal, the Union of South Africa, and Dominica.

    In summarizing the discussion on the issue of ending colonialism, the Soviet representative Zorin pointed out that, with the exception of a small number of colonial countries and their lackeys, the vast majority of representatives condemned colonialism and demanded its complete and immediate elimination. He said that the vast majority of countries supported the basic principles contained in the Soviet draft declaration and reflected in the declaration adopted by the General Assembly, which pleased the Soviet delegation.

    联大结束关于给殖民地独立的宣言的讨论
    以压倒多数通过亚非四十三国宣言草案
    佐林指出苏联宣言的基本原则在亚非国家宣言中得到反映
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社纽约14日讯：联合国大会全体会议14日结束了苏联提出的关于给予殖民地国家和人民独立的宣言的讨论。
    这次讨论是在11月28日开始的。在会议过程中，苏联政府提出了一项宣言草案，要求立即按照人民所自由表达的意志和愿望给予一切殖民地国家、托管地和其他非自治领土完全的独立和自由。草案规定完全消除殖民主义制度和各种殖民主义统治机构，取消一切诸如在别国领土上的领地和租地的殖民主义据点，并呼吁各国政府在国际关系中始终严格遵守平等、尊重一切国家的主权和领土完整的原则。
    四十三个亚非国家（最初是二十五个国家，后来增加到四十三个国家）也提出了一项宣言草案，建议立即采取措施，以便给予托管地和非自治领土或其他一些还没有取得独立的领土的人民政权。这一宣言草案包含着苏联草案中的一系列带有原则性的论点。草案还指出，破坏民族统一和国家领土完整的任何企图都是不能容忍的。
    苏联对四十三个亚非国家的宣言草案提出了修正案，规定给予殖民地人民独立的最后期限不迟于明年年底，并且应当在联合国大会第十六届会议上讨论本决议案的执行情况。
    大会首先分段表决苏联关于给予殖民地国家和人民独立的宣言草案。宣言的实质部分以三票之差被否决（三十五票对三十二票，三十票弃权）。对这一部分投赞成票的有社会主义国家和大多数亚非国家。投反对票的主要是西方国家。投票赞成苏联的宣言草案的其他部分的有二十五个代表团，反对的有四十三个代表团，二十九个代表团弃权。
    接着表决苏联对亚非提案的修正案，苏联的修正案没有被通过。
    亚非国家提出的给予殖民地国家和人民独立的宣言草案以九十票赞成获得通过，只有少数国家的代表团弃权，它们是美国、英国、法国、比利时、澳大利亚、西班牙、葡萄牙、南非联邦和多米尼加。
    苏联代表佐林在总结关于结束殖民主义问题的讨论时指出，除了一小部分殖民主义国家及其仆从外，绝大多数代表都谴责了殖民主义，并且要求彻底和立即地消灭殖民主义。他说，绝大多数国家支持苏联宣言草案中所包含的、并且在大会通过的宣言中得到反映的基本原则，这使苏联代表团感到满意。
