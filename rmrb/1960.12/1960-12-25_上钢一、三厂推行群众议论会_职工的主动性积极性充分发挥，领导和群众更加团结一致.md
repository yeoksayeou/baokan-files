Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 24th: The Shanghai No. 1 and No. 3 Steel Plants, in strengthening ideological and political work and deeply developing the mass movement, have created an experience: mass discussion meetings. Through constant discussion, the masses have developed great initiative and enthusiasm, and the leadership and the masses, and the masses among themselves, are more closely united, and production has continued to rise steadily.

Masses Discuss Freely and Speak Their Minds
Mass discussion meetings are the product of full democracy promoted by leaders at all levels of the two plants, and the result of the further in-depth development of the mass movement. Previously, each steelmaking workshop in the two plants had pre-shift and post-shift meetings. In July, the plant leaders went to the front lines of production, insisted on working and consulting with the masses, and participated in the workers' pre-shift and post-shift meetings, which led to new developments in the post-shift meetings, making them a regular place for leaders and the masses to consult together. They also summarized three experiences for holding good post-shift meetings: First, the meeting time should not be long, and the leaders should speak briefly and concisely, allowing the masses to speak and discuss more; second, whatever important issues arise in production and work, the leaders should guide the masses to discuss those issues, without rushing to conclusions; third, the leaders should record all the requests made by the masses during the discussions and the ideas they come up with, and should support and implement whatever can be done. After implementing these three points, the post-shift meetings in each workshop underwent great changes, with the masses discussing freely, speaking their minds, and brainstorming with the leaders. Post-shift discussion meetings became a form welcomed by the masses. This spirit was quickly widely applied to other meetings. Workers in the No. 2 Converter Workshop of the No. 3 Steel Plant created various forms such as special topic discussion meetings, collaboration discussion meetings, and comprehensive discussion meetings. There were both informal mass discussions after each shift and regular mass discussions after the end of a production cycle; there were both discussion meetings on general production situations and discussion meetings on specific issues. Discussions were taking place everywhere. It became a common practice for leaders and the masses to discuss issues together.

It Becomes a Common Practice for Leaders and the Masses to Discuss Issues
In recent months, it has become a common practice for leaders at all levels of the two plants to discuss issues with the masses at discussion meetings. The issues, plans, or ideas put forward by the leadership, after full discussion and absorption of the wisdom of the masses, have often achieved satisfactory results. Earlier, large blowers were used in the iron-smelting furnaces in the converter workshops, and the manual transport of slag and coke could not keep up, often causing material shedding and increasing the labor intensity of the workers. The No. 2 Converter Workshop of the No. 3 Steel Plant proposed to vigorously promote vehicle mechanization in order to rapidly improve material transport efficiency. Two leading cadres in the workshop each designed a preliminary plan for rail mechanization and turntable mechanization, and submitted them to the masses for discussion. When the Party branch organized the mass discussion, it stated that if these two plans were basically feasible, it would offer suggestions for supplementation and modification; if it was believed that neither of these plans was feasible, new plans could be proposed, and the leadership would definitely support them. In this way, the masses began to discuss. They not only discussed at the meetings, but also discussed everywhere after the meetings. At the stockyard and beside the furnaces, workers could often be seen working and arguing about this matter. At mealtime, many people naturally gathered at one table to explain their opinions while eating. Some workers even thought hard at home, designing drawings. After several days of discussion, the masses came up with a better plan: using labor carts to transport materials, with two wheels and a bucket, one person can do the work of six, and they can run everywhere, which is simpler and more flexible than rail mechanization and turntable mechanization. Based on the opinions of the masses, the leadership immediately conducted experiments and gradually promoted it. After discussion, the masses had unified thinking and consistent understanding, and their enthusiasm for implementation was very high. They took the initiative to manufacture labor carts themselves, quickly solving the key problem of material shedding, and greatly reducing labor intensity.

Advanced Experiences Among the Masses are Widely Disseminated
Mass discussion meetings enable the advanced experiences and good methods among the workers to be widely disseminated, thereby solving many key problems in production and work. At one time, water leakage from the water tanks on the iron-smelting furnaces was a major obstacle to the great leap forward in production in the converter workshops, often forcing them to stop production to repair the furnaces, and it had not been resolved. In September, this matter was discussed at a mass discussion meeting in the No. 2 Converter Workshop of the No. 3 Steel Plant. The masses said, "Why do five of the six iron-smelting furnaces in the workshop have leaking water tanks, while the water tank of No. 1 furnace does not leak?" At the meeting, the workers of No. 1 furnace introduced their experience, which consisted of only six words: "Look, touch, and knock." It turned out that the Huangpu River water used in the furnaces contained garbage that would settle and easily clog the water pipes. When the water flow in the water tank was not smooth, it was easy to burn out and cause leakage. In response to this situation, the workers of No. 1 furnace often looked to see if the water pressure had decreased, and touched to see if the water temperature had increased. If the water temperature was high and the water pressure was low, it was very likely that the water pipes were clogged. At this time, they would knock on the water pipes with sticks to cause the garbage in the water pipes to be shaken loose and flow away. This experience was easy for the workers to understand, remember, and implement, and it was immediately promoted on all furnaces. The major problem of water leakage from water tanks was quickly resolved.

Constantly Adjusting the Relationship Between Leaders and the Masses, and Between the Masses
Mass discussion meetings have also become the best classroom for self-education and mutual education for the leaders and the masses, and for the masses among themselves, in the two plants. It constantly adjusts the relationship between the leaders and the masses, and between different groups of masses, and promotes new ideas and new styles among the masses. The No. 5 Converter in the No. 1 Converter Workshop of the No. 1 Steel Plant was doing well in production and had been rated as a red banner furnace several times in a row. However, in the past, in the competition with the No. 4 Converter, there was often a phenomenon of competing for good molten iron, and the two furnaces did not cooperate well enough. In October, the workers on the two furnaces held a discussion meeting together, made self-criticisms of each other, and discussed a principle: not only should one furnace be good, but the workshop should also be good; low-sulfur molten iron should be given to other furnaces, and high-sulfur molten iron should be kept for themselves. After that, whenever they encountered high-sulfur molten iron, the furnace leader of No. 5 furnace would rush to take it, and when they encountered good molten iron, both sides would compete to give it away. At the same time, No. 5 furnace also sent workers to actively clean the furnace pit and mix molten iron at No. 4 furnace, and actively helped the competitors catch up with themselves. In November, No. 4 furnace also became a red banner furnace. The workers in each workshop also frankly criticized the shortcomings of the Party branch secretaries and workshop directors and other leading cadres at the discussion meetings; they also offered opinions and reported situations to the leading cadres at any time and in any form; the leaders and the masses were as close as fish and water, and information flowed smoothly between the top and the bottom. This enabled the leaders to understand the demands of the masses and the problems in production at any time, and to solve the problems more quickly.

While Fully Promoting Democracy, Centralized Leadership Was Also Strengthened
Mass discussion meetings are conducted purposefully under the leadership of the Party branch. Party branch secretaries, workshop directors, Party branch secretaries, and on-duty directors regularly participate in mass discussion meetings. Some of the major suggestions put forward by the masses at the discussion meetings are also brought up by the leadership to the Party branch or the factory Party committee for research and decision-making, and then implemented among the masses. Because of the full promotion of democracy and the unfolding of discussions, centralized leadership has also been strengthened, and the thinking and actions of the upper and lower levels, and of the left and right, are more consistent and resolute in the implementation of many major measures. In order to increase steel production, the three shifts of furnace lining workers in the No. 2 Converter Workshop of the No. 3 Steel Plant experimented with modifying the converter furnace type, but the various modifications were not uniform, which instead caused the furnace life of many furnaces to decrease and the output to decrease. After the workshop leaders discovered this problem, they immediately called together the furnace lining workers and the furnace front workers of the three shifts to discuss, compare the advantages and disadvantages of various furnace types, and finally jointly determined a set of the best furnace types, which were widely promoted and quickly unified the operation. The furnace life was generally extended, and the output was rapidly increased. (Attached picture)

    上钢一、三厂推行群众议论会
    职工的主动性积极性充分发挥，领导和群众更加团结一致
    据新华社上海24日电　上海第一钢铁厂和上海第三钢铁厂在加强思想政治工作、深入开展群众运动中，创造了一条经验：群众议论会。通过经常不断的议论，群众发挥出极大的主动性和积极性，领导和群众、群众和群众之间更加团结一致，生产持续稳步上升。
    群众议论纷纷畅所欲言
    群众议论会是两个厂各级领导干部充分发扬民主的产物，是群众运动更加深入发展的结果。以前，两个厂的各炼钢车间都有班前、班后会。7月份，厂的领导干部深入生产第一线，坚持和群众同劳动、同商量，参加工人的班前、班后会，使班后会得到了新的发展，成为领导和群众同商量的经常场所，并且总结出开好班后会的三条经验：一条是会议时间不要长，领导讲话短些，扼要些，让群众多讲，多议论；第二条是生产和工作中有什么重要问题，领导就引导群众议论什么问题，领导不忙着作结论；第三条是群众在议论中对领导提出的要求和群众想的主意，领导要逐条记下来，凡是能够做到的，一定支持使之实现。执行了这三条以后，各车间的班后会起了很大的变化，群众议论纷纷，畅所欲言，和领导一起出主意。班后议论会成为群众所欢迎的一种形式。这种精神很快就被广泛运用到其它的会议中去了。三厂第二转炉车间职工创造了专题议论会、协作议论会和综合议论会等多种形式。车间里既有每班生产后不拘形式的群众议论，又有一个生产周期结束后定期的群众议论；既有一般生产情况的议论会，又有专门问题的议论会。到处是议论纷纷。领导和群众商量问题蔚为风气
    几个月来，两个厂的领导干部在议论会上和群众商量问题已经蔚为风气。领导方面提的问题，提的方案或出的主意，经过充分议论，吸收了群众的智慧，许多都得到了完满的结果。前一时期，转炉车间化铁炉上使用了大风机，人工运送渣料和焦炭跟不上，常常发生脱料现象，工人劳动强度也比较高。三厂第二转炉车间提出要大搞车子化，以便迅速提高运料效率。车间有两个领导干部各设计了一套铁道化、转盘化的初步方案，交给群众议论。车间党总支在组织群众议论时，表示如果这两个方案基本可行，就提出意见加以补充修改；如果认为这两个方案都不行，也可以另提新的方案，领导一定支持。这样一来，群众就议论开了。他们不仅在会上议论，而且会后也到处议论，料场上、炉子旁常常看到工人边工作、边争论这件事，吃饭的时候，许多人很自然的聚到一张桌子上，一边吃饭一边说明自己的意见。有的工人回到家里也在苦苦思索，设计图样。几天议论下来，群众议出了一个更好的方案：用劳动车送料，两个轮子加只斗，人工一等六，到处可以跑，比铁道化、转盘化更简便、更灵活。领导根据群众意见，立即试验，逐步推行。经过议论，群众思想统一，认识一致，执行起来积极性很高，他们抽出人来自己制造劳动车，很快解决了脱料的生产大关键，劳动强度大大减轻。
    群众中的先进经验广为传播
    群众议论会能使工人群众中先进的经验和好的办法广为传播，从而使许多生产、工作上的关键问题迎刃而解。有一个时期，化铁炉上的水箱漏水是各转炉车间生产跃进中的大障碍，常常因此而被迫停产修炉，一直没有得到解决。9月份，这件事在三厂第二转炉车间的群众议论会上议开了。群众说：“为什么车间里六只化铁炉有五只炉的水箱漏水，而一号炉却不漏呢？”会上，一号炉工人介绍了他们的经验，这个经验只有六个字：“看看，摸摸，敲敲。”原来炉子上用的黄浦江水里有垃圾，会沉淀，容易淤塞水管，水箱水流不畅，就容易烧坏而造成漏水。针对这个情况，一号炉工人经常看看水压有没有降低，摸摸水温有没有提高，若是水温高了、水压低了，就很可能是水管淤塞，这时用棍棒敲敲水管，使水管里的垃圾经过震动而流失。这个经验，工人们听得懂、记得住、办得到，马上在所有炉子上推广，水箱漏水的大问题很快就解决了。
    不断调整领导和群众、群众和群众之间的关系
    群众议论会也成了两个厂领导和群众、群众和群众自我教育与相互教育的最好的课堂，它经常不断地调整着领导和群众、这部分群众和那部分群众之间的关系，发扬了群众中的新思想和新风格。一厂第一转炉车间的五号转炉生产搞得好，连续几次被评为红旗炉。但是以前在和四号转炉竞赛中，常常出现互相争好铁水的现象，两只炉子协作得不够好。10月份，两个炉子上的工人在一起开了议论会，互相作了自我批评，并且议论出一条：不能只顾一只炉子好，还要车间好；要把低硫铁水让给别的炉子，高硫铁水留给自己。此后，再遇到吃高硫铁水，五号炉炉长抢着要，遇到好铁水双方争着让。同时，五号炉还派工人主动去四号炉清炉坑、兑铁水，积极帮助竞赛对手赶上自己。11月份，四号炉也成为红旗炉。各车间工人群众对车间党总支书记和车间主任等领导干部的缺点，也在议论会上坦率地提出批评；还不拘形式地随时向领导干部提意见，反映情况；领导和群众水乳交融，上下通气。这样就使领导随时了解了群众的要求和生产中的问题，解决问题也更及时了。
    在充分发扬民主的同时，也加强了集中领导
    群众议论会是在车间党总支的领导下有目的地进行的。车间党总支书记、车间主任、党支部书记和值班主任等干部都经常参加群众的议论会。群众在议论会上提出的一些重大的建议，领导上还提到车间党总支或厂党委去研究，做出决定，然后再到群众中去贯彻执行。由于充分发扬民主，展开议论，同时也加强了集中领导，许多重大的措施执行起来上下左右思想更加一致，行动更加坚决。三厂第二转炉车间为了提高钢产量，三个班炉衬工人试验修改转炉炉型，但各种改法不统一反而使不少炉子的炉龄下降，产量降低。车间领导发现这个问题以后，马上召集三个班的炉衬工人和炉前工人一起议论，比较各种不同炉型的优缺点，最后共同确定了一组最好的炉型，普遍推广，很快统一了操作，炉龄普遍延长，产量迅速提高。（附图片）
