    The Most Resourceful Person
    – An Account of Xu Kaixi, Party Branch Secretary of the Red Flag Fourth Production Team
    By Our Reporters Fang Di, Tian Zhuang, Li Jinkai

    Xu Kaixi is the Party Branch Secretary of the Red Flag Fourth Production Team in Hongshan Commune, Sui County, Hubei Province. This spring, due to work needs, the Commune Party Committee decided to transfer Xu Kaixi to work in the management area. After this news spread to the team, the members discussed it animatedly. One said, "Let Secretary Xu stay!" Another said, "Old Xu is our confidant; how can we bear to let him go!" When the management area reported the opinions of the masses to the Commune Party Committee, the Commune Party Committee considered the opinions of the masses and decided that Xu Kaixi would stay in the Red Flag Fourth Production Team to continue serving as the Party Branch Secretary.

    Why did the members love Xu Kaixi so much, and why were they so willing to work under his leadership? To answer this question, one must see what kind of person Xu Kaixi actually is.

    "Our Old Xu is the most resourceful person!" This is how the masses evaluate him.

    The Red Flag Fourth Production Team he leads has a total of 103 households and 413 people. It is a place with many mountains and little land, with an average of just over 1.5 mu of paddy and dry land per person. For several years, it has relied on the state for grain supply, and it is a poor place. After agricultural cooperativization, although production has become stronger year by year, and life has become better year by year, it is still very poor compared to other places. However, in just over two years, the average person already has more than three mu of land. Whether in terms of grain yield, member income, or contribution to the state, it is among the best in the entire commune; this has shaken off the historical state of poverty and jumped to become a relatively wealthy production team.

    How could such a big change have occurred in such a short period of time? In conversations with the members here, the most impressive thing left on us was the following events:

    As the saying goes, "Hating people leads to poverty, hating land leads to wealth," and "Without planting a hundred dou, it's difficult to harvest a hundred shi," meaning that to harvest more grain, one must plant more; and the prerequisite for planting more is more land. However, the Red Flag Fourth Production Team happens to have little land. In the valley, all the places where crops can be grown are planted, and there is simply no empty space; planting on the mountains is full of thorns, making land reclamation too difficult; moreover, whether planting crops after reclamation can yield a harvest, no one can be sure – this was the biggest concern of the masses at the time. How can the poverty situation be changed more quickly? As early as shortly after the establishment of the advanced cooperative, Xu Kaixi had been considering this issue. After the establishment of the People's Commune, it made him even more restless. One day, he thought of the Dalang Mountain twenty miles away, a mountain with a large area and a sparse population, so he went there with Du Zhiguo, the deputy captain of the production team, with dry food to check it out. However, they traveled all over Dalang Mountain and still did not find any wasteland that was easy to reclaim. In the end, they organized thirty or so members to reclaim wasteland in the Jiefang management area seventy miles away. After spending forty days and making a tremendous effort, only thirty-odd mu of wasteland were reclaimed, and the members had many opinions. Xu Kaixi was really in trouble at this time. Suddenly, it occurred to him: I should consult with the masses to see if there is any way. So, he found the old peasants Yan Guangqun and Liu Qishu and asked them directly:

    "Can't we really grow crops on this mountain?"

    Yan Guangqun and Liu Qishu were both from poor peasant backgrounds, were good at farming, and usually listened to the Party. This time, when they heard Xu Kaixi ask this, they immediately thought about the past. After a while, Old Yan said with certainty: "People in the past also reclaimed wasteland on this mountain and planted crops, and the harvest was not bad!"

    Xu Kaixi seized this clue and carefully discussed with them the matter of previous land reclamation. Then, after research by the branch, it was decided to first reclaim wasteland on the back mountain of Yanjia Ridge. In just a few days, fifteen mu of wasteland were reclaimed, and seven mu of sesame and eight mu of cotton were sown. By July and August, the sesame and cotton grew so well that everyone praised it. This greatly liberated people's minds. From the autumn and winter of that year, without any call to action, the members carried hoes and sickles and climbed into the thorny forests to chop (trees that had matured were not chopped) and dig, finally turning the barren mountains into "treasure mountains" that grew both trees and grain. In this way, over the past two years, their cultivated land area has expanded from 670 mu to 1,370 mu, providing conditions for planting more and harvesting more.

    This is a story of Xu Kaixi relying on the masses to reclaim wasteland, expand area, and implement intercropping of forests and grains. The reason why Xu Kaixi is the most resourceful is that he can humbly learn from the masses and listen to the masses in everything. He is united with a group of old farmers with good backgrounds and rich experience, and they often offer him advice. Therefore, every call of the Party, he can combine it with the specific conditions of the local area, thereby achieving the goal of increased production. Here, the story of planting wheat in paddy fields has also been widely praised:

    The Red Flag Fourth Team used to harvest only one season a year. Every year after the autumn harvest of rice, most of the paddy fields were left idle, and nothing was planted; in addition, a small number of paddy fields were sometimes planted with barley, wheat, and bean crops, but generally, no attention was paid to management, "If we can harvest, we harvest; if we can't harvest, we use it as fertilizer." Later, the county party committee called for changing from one crop a year to two crops a year, that is, planting another season of summer harvest crops in the paddy fields to increase grain production. At that time, Xu Kaixi analyzed the team's farming habits and found that there were many reasons why everyone was not accustomed to planting wheat in paddy fields, the most important of which was the large number of "cold slurry fields." These fields have a high groundwater level and low ground temperature, and water seeps out all year round, so planting wheat often does not yield a good harvest. But as a Party worker, can you not actively respond to the Party's call? No! However, if the above contradictions cannot be properly resolved, it will be difficult to mobilize the masses. But what should be done? He found out that there was an old member in the First Team named Zeng Defa who had planted wheat in paddy fields in the past, and it grew well. So, he found Zeng Defa and asked for advice like a primary school student:

    "Why can't we plant wheat in cold slurry fields?"

    "Why can't we plant? We can plant!" Old Zeng replied.

    "We can plant? Then why do so many people say it won't work?"

    "As long as the effort is there, all fields will harvest grain!"

    After in-depth conversations, Xu Kaixi discovered that Zeng's experience in planting wheat was: When the rice is just turning yellow, dig ditches around to drain the water, so as to facilitate timely plowing and soil improvement, and prepare for planting wheat; as soon as the wheat is planted, immediately carry out ditch reforms, that is, change from having no ditches to having ditches, from shallow ditches to deep ditches, and from small ditches to large ditches, so that the ditches are connected. In this way, the groundwater level is lowered, and it is ensured that the fields dry after rain, and the wheat will not be submerged. Xu Kaixi told the members about Zeng's experience, and it was quickly accepted by everyone. As a result, the whole team saw a high tide of innovating the farming system and planting wheat in paddy fields on a large scale. After that, Xu Kaixi also adopted the same method, summing up experience among the masses, and then passing the experience to the masses, reasonably arranging planting according to the team's terrain, soil quality, and crop growth, intercropping tall and short crops on a large scale, and planting soybeans and broad beans all over the field edges and corners, thereby achieving the goal of planting more and harvesting more.

    Xu Kaixi said it well: "Listening to the Party and listening to the masses is the foundation for doing a good job." However, Xu Kaixi deeply understands that without a cadre team that strives for the collective interests of the masses, it is impossible to truly listen to the Party and listen to the masses in the work. Therefore, he pays special attention to helping and improving cadres. And in this regard, he first often strictly demands himself. For several years, he has been eating, living, and working with the masses, with no special treatment. In the first half of this year alone, he did more than 1,200 work points. No matter what he does, he insists on experimenting and making models, and promoting them after making a model. In order to mobilize members to help cadres improve their work style, at Xu Kaixi's initiative, the team has always adhered to the system of mass appraisal of cadres and election of cadres. Therefore, for the past two years, the cadres of the entire production team have been diligently and practically leading the members forward like him.

    最有办法的人
    ——记红旗第四生产队党支部书记徐开西
    本报记者　方堤　田庄　李金锴
    徐开西是湖北省随县洪山公社红旗第四生产队的党支部书记。今年春天，根据工作的需要，公社党委决定把徐开西调到管理区工作。这个消息传到队里后，社员们议论纷纷。这个说：“把徐书记留下吧！”那个说：“老徐是我们的贴心人，咋舍得他走啊！”当管理区把群众的意见向公社党委汇报后，公社党委考虑了群众的意见，决定徐开西留在红旗第四生产队继续担任支部书记。
    社员们为什么那样地喜爱徐开西，那样愿意在他领导下工作？要回答这个问题，得看看徐开西到底是个什么样的人。
                      ×　×　×
    “我们老徐是个最有办法的人！”这是群众对他的评价。
    他领导的红旗第四生产队总共一百零三户，四百一十三人。山多地少，平均每人水田旱地一起才合有一亩半多一点。几年来一直靠国家供应粮食过日子，是个贫苦的地方。农业合作化后，虽说生产一年比一年强，生活也一年比一年好，但同其他地方比起来，还是很苦。可是仅仅经过两年多的时间，每人平均已有土地三亩多。无论是从粮食产量、社员收入还是对国家贡献来说，在全公社都是名列前茅的；这就摆脱了历史的贫困局面，一跃而成为比较富裕的生产队了。
    在这样短的时间内，怎么会发生这样大的变化呢？在跟这里的社员交谈中，给我们留下印象最深刻的，有这样几件事情：
    常言道：“恨人必穷，恨土必富”、“不种百斗，难收百石”，意思都是说要多收粮就得多种；而多种的先决条件是土地多。可是，红旗第四生产队恰恰土地少。冲里，能种庄稼的地方全种上了，简直没空地；往山上种吧，到处荆棘丛生，开荒太不容易；而且，开出种上庄稼，能不能收谁也拿不准——这是当时群众最大的顾虑。怎样才能更快地改变穷困的面貌呢？早在高级社建立以后不久，徐开西就一直考虑着这一问题。人民公社建立后，就更使他不能平静。一天，他想起二十里外有个大狼山，山大人稀，就同生产队副队长杜志国一起，带上干粮，到那里去查看。可是，他们走遍了大狼山，还是没找到好开的荒地。最后，他们组织了三十来个社员到七十里外的解放管理区开荒。花了四十天，费了九牛二虎的劲，才开出荒地三十多亩，社员很有意见。徐开西这时真作难了。他猛地一想：还是去找群众商量一下，看有没有办法。于是，他找到老农晏光群、刘启树，开门见山地问：
    “我们这山上真不长庄稼吗？”
    晏光群、刘启树都是贫农出身，庄稼活是好把式，平常肯听党的话。这次听徐开西这么一问，他们立即用心思索往事。过了一阵，晏老头语气肯定地说：“前人也有在这山上开荒种过地的，收成并不差！”
    徐开西抓住这个线索，仔细地跟他们扯谈了有关前人开荒的事。然后，经过支部研究，决定先在晏家垅的后山上开荒。只几天时间，就开出了十五亩荒山，播下了七亩芝麻，八亩棉花。到了7、8月间，芝麻、棉花长的人人说好。这一下大大解放了人们的思想。从这年秋、冬起，根本没用号召，社员们便纷纷扛起镢头，拿着镰刀，爬上荆棘丛生的树林里，砍呀（成材树未砍），挖呀，终于把一架架荒山开成了既长树又产粮的“宝山”。就是这样，两年来他们的耕地面积从六百七十亩，扩大到一千三百七十亩，为多种多收提供了条件。
    这就是徐开西依靠群众开荒扩大面积，实行林粮间作的一段故事。徐开西之所以最有办法，就在于他能够虚心向群众学习，处处听群众的话。他团结有一批出身好、经验多的老农，他们经常为他出谋献策。因此，每次党的号召，他都能与本地具体条件结合起来，从而达到了增产的目的。在这里，关于水田种麦也是一直被传颂的一个故事：
    红旗四队，过去一年只收一季。每年入秋收罢稻谷，绝大部分水田就闲置起来了，什么也不种；另有很少一点水田有时也种大麦、小麦和豆类作物，但一般都不注意管理，“能收就收，不收就沤（沤肥）”。后来，县委号召改一年一熟为一年两熟，即在水田里多种一季夏收作物，以增加粮食产量。当时，徐开西针对本队的耕作习惯进行分析，发现大家对水田种麦不习惯的原因很多，其中最主要的是“寒浆田”多。这种田地下水位高，地温低，一年到头往外泌水，种麦往往收成不好。但作为一个党的工作者，对党的号召能够不积极响应吗？不能！可是，如果不能妥善地解决上述矛盾，群众也很难发动。但是，应该怎么办呢？他打听出第一小队有个叫曾德发的老社员，过去在水田里种过小麦，而且长得不错。于是，他找到曾德发，像小学生似地请教起来：
    “寒浆田为啥种不得麦子呀？”
    “咋不能种？能种?！”曾老汉回答说。
    “能种？那为啥好多人都说不成？”
    “只要工夫到，啥田也收粮！”
    经过深入交谈，徐开西发现曾老汉种麦的经验是：在稻谷刚黄梢的时候，四周挖沟排水，便于及时翻耕炕土，为种麦作好准备；麦子一下种，紧跟着搞沟厢改革，即改无沟为有沟，改浅沟为深沟，改小沟为大沟，做到沟沟相通。这样一来，既降低了地下水位，又保证了雨住田干，麦子不会受渍。徐开西把曾老汉的经验对社员一说，很快就被大家接受了。于是，全队出现了革新耕作制度，大搞水田种麦的高潮。这以后，徐开西还采取同样的方法，到群众中总结经验，又把经验交给群众，按照全队地形、土质和作物生长情况，合理布局，因地种植，大搞高矮作物间作套种，利用田边地角遍种黄豆、蚕豆，从而实现了多种多收的目的。
    徐开西说得好：“听党的话，也听群众的话，是做好工作的根本。”但是，徐开西深深地懂得：没有具有为群众集体利益而奋斗的干部队伍，在工作中真正做到听党的话，听群众的话，也是不可能的。因此，他特别注意帮助和提高干部。而在这方面，他首先又经常严格要求自己。几年来，他一直跟群众同吃同住同劳动，没有一点特殊的地方。仅今年上半年就做了一千二百多个工分。不论干啥，他都坚持作试验，搞样板，做出样子再推广。为了发动社员帮助干部改进作风，在徐开西的倡议下，这个队一直坚持了群众评比干部和选举干部的制度。因此，两年来，整个生产队的干部都像他一样勤勤恳恳、扎扎实实地领导着社员前进。
