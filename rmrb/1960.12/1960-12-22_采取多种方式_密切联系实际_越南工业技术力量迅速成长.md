Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 21st: With the development of industrial construction, the industrial technical strength of North Vietnam is growing rapidly. To date, for every thousand heavy industrial workers in North Vietnam, there are thirty-three engineers and technical cadres, which is nine more than when industrial development began vigorously three years ago.

In the past three years, with the rapid development of industry, the number of workers in North Vietnam has nearly doubled. Most of the workers in factories and mines are demobilized soldiers and young peasants from the countryside, with relatively low levels of education and technical skills. During this period, the leading departments of Vietnam's heavy industry and construction industry promptly addressed this situation, taking various forms to vigorously train technical cadres and workers. Factories and mines in the heavy industry sector universally organized long-term and short-term vocational training courses. The construction sector also opened a large number of training courses in design, construction surveying, and drafting to cultivate various professional talents.

Due to the adoption of various forms and close links with production practice, the training and cultivation speed is fast and the results are good. The heavy industry department trains more than 15,000 to 20,000 junior and intermediate technical cadres annually. The construction department has also trained nearly 1,000 intermediate and junior technicians, enriching the technical backbone in design, construction, and other areas.

    采取多种方式　密切联系实际
    越南工业技术力量迅速成长
    据新华社河内21日电　随着工业建设的发展，越南北方工业技术力量正在迅速成长。到目前为止，越南北方每一千个重工业工人中，就有三十三名工程师和技术干部，这比三年前开始大力发展工业时多了九名。
    三年来，随着工业的迅速发展，越南北方的工人增加了将近一倍。各厂矿企业的工人大多是来自部队的转业军人和来自农村的青年农民，原来的文化和技术水平较低，各部门普遍缺乏技术干部和技术工人。在这期间，越南的重工业和建筑工业的领导部门及时针对这种情况，采取多种形式，大力培养技术干部和工人。重工业部门各厂矿普遍组织长期的和短期的业务学习班。建筑部门也开办了大量设计、施工测量、绘图等学习班，培养各种专业人材。
    由于采取多种形式和紧密联系生产实际，训练和培养速度快、效果好。重工业部门每年培养初级和中级技术干部一万五千到二万以上。建筑部门也培养了近一千名中级和初级技术人员，充实了设计、施工等技术骨干力量。
