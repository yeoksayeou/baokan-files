Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch, Stanleyville: In Stanleyville, the capital of Congo's Orientale Province, patriotic Congolese soldiers have taken decisive action to combat the provocative activities of Belgian colonialists in order to safeguard Congo's independence.

It is reported that on November 26th and 27th, Congolese soldiers arrested a large number of Belgian colonialists who were attempting to create chaos there, some of whom were Belgian colonialists who had fled when Congo became independent and had recently returned. One Congolese soldier angrily questioned these colonialists, "Why did you come back? We don't want you anymore." Congolese soldiers warned some Belgian colonialists who were engaging in destructive activities under the guise of priests that they would be punished if they carried out activities in the African residential areas of the city.

The report said that under the resolute crackdown by Congolese soldiers, many colonialists began to flee Stanleyville on November 30th.

Meanwhile, on the road from Gamena in Katanga Province to Manono, the Baluba people, enraged by the massacre by "UN forces," are adopting guerrilla tactics and bravely resisting the interference and suppression by "UN forces" with old-fashioned rifles. According to reports, the Baluba people are digging trenches more than eight feet deep and twelve feet wide at intervals on the road to prevent "UN" trucks from advancing, and are also using the jungle as cover to resist the "UN" offensive.

Xinhua News Agency, 30th Dispatch, Elisabethville: The Baluba Katanga Party in Katanga Province, Congo, recently issued an ultimatum, ordering European colonialists and Tshombe's reactionary police to get out of Kabalo, an important stronghold in the northern part of the province, within five days. This is one of the important areas where the Baluba people are launching a struggle against the traitorous Tshombe clique.

According to a spokesman for the Tshombe group's "Information Department" on the 29th, the Baluba Katanga Party's ultimatum was put forward in a statement. According to the spokesman, Baluba Katanga Party leaders from Manono, Malamba-Bekulu, and Ankoro recently held a meeting in Kabalo and issued a statement saying that the police of the Tshombe group in Katanga Province and European colonialists must withdraw from Kabalo within five days, otherwise, the Baluba people's armed forces will launch a new offensive. The Baluba Katanga Party also warned the "UN forces" in the statement that if the "UN forces" interfere in the patriotic struggle of the people there, they will be resolutely countered by the patriotic people.

    新华社1日讯　斯坦利维尔消息：在刚果东方省省会斯坦利维尔，刚果爱国士兵采取坚决行动打击比利时殖民者的挑衅活动，以维护刚果的独立。
    据报道，在11月26日和27日，刚果士兵们逮捕了大批在那里企图制造混乱的比利时殖民者，其中有些是刚果独立时逃走而最近卷土重来的比利时殖民者。一个刚果士兵向这批殖民者愤怒地质问道，“你们为什么要回来？我们再也不要你们了。”刚果士兵对一些披着牧师外衣进行破坏活动的比利时殖民者提出警告说，如果他们到这个城市的非洲人居住区进行活动的话，就要进行制裁。
    消息说，在刚果士兵的坚决打击下，许多殖民者在11月30日开始逃离斯坦利维尔。
    同时，在加丹加省加米纳通往马诺诺的公路上，被“联合国军”屠杀暴行激怒了的巴卢巴族人民正在采取游击战术，用古式步枪英勇地抗击“联合国军”的干涉镇压行动。消息说，巴卢巴族人在公路上每隔一段挖一些八英尺多深、十二英尺宽的壕沟，阻止“联合国军”的卡车前进，并且还利用丛林作掩护抗击“联合国军”的进攻。
    据新华社30日讯　伊利沙伯维尔消息：刚果加丹加省巴卢巴卡特党最近发出最后通牒，勒令欧洲殖民者和冲伯反动警察在五天之内滚出该省北部重要据点卡巴洛。这里是巴卢巴族人民展开反对冲伯卖国集团斗争的重要地区之一。
    据冲伯集团“新闻部”发言人29日透露，巴卢巴卡特党这个最后通牒是在一项声明中提出的。据这个发言人说，马诺诺、马朗巴—贝库卢和昂科罗地方的巴卢巴卡特党领袖们最近在卡巴洛举行了一次会议，并发表声明说，加丹加省冲伯集团的警察和欧洲殖民者必须在五天之内撤出卡巴洛，否则，巴卢巴人民武装将发动新的进攻。巴卢巴卡特党在声明中还向“联合国军”提出警告说，假如“联合国军”对那里人民的爱国斗争进行干涉，将遭到爱国人民的坚决反击。
