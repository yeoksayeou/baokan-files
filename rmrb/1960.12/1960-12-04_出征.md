    Going to War
    Zhang Yongmei is getting married, with a brand new style: She cut off her braid and combed her hair short, tied a two-inch wide leather belt around her waist, no rouge or powder on her red face, a pair of big eyes shooting out piercing rays. With a small backpack on her back, she is about to set off! The girl is getting married, her husband's home is on a small island: Across the East Sea, the wind and waves make the road uneven, the sound of cannons booms, gunpowder smoke rolls, and sometimes shrapnel can hurt people! The naked eye can see Jinmen Island, and hear the enemy howling! The girl is getting married, who is the groom? A young man from the frontline commune, an eagle in the midst of gunfire! Before the artillery battle, his output was 880, during the artillery battle, the red line rose to 1,000 jin! This eagle flew over the waves and barbed wire, scattering leaflets on Jinmen, the enemy says he is a god, coming without a trace and leaving without a shadow. The girl is getting married, head held high, chest out: Heading towards the road of beacon fires, going to the front line to take root, transplanting rice seedlings in the gunfire, plowing deeply in the gunfire, learning to cross the sea and scatter leaflets, learning to fire cannons and strike down the plague gods! To dedicate all her skills to the people on the front line! Forging in the fire, tempering in the fire, fighting the enemy! The girl is getting married, striding to the seaside: The sound of cannons faintly comes, the waves of the East Sea roll up sparks. The girl flies onto the boat, waving goodbye to her family, the cannons boom, like wedding gongs and drums! The new bride is even more a new soldier, getting married is going to war!
