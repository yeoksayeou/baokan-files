Xinhua News Agency, December 10th: Yugoslav newspapers reveal that the education situation in Yugoslavia is deteriorating. Many areas lack teachers, primary and secondary schools are closing, and a growing number of young people are threatened with dropping out of school.

    Lack of Teachers Leads to the Closure of Many Schools

    Belgrade's "Evening News" wrote on October 26th in an article titled "Not Enough Primary and Secondary School Teachers" that due to a shortage of teachers, "many schools in various places cannot open this year." This situation exists in the republics of Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Montenegro. According to a report in the "Youth Daily" on January 14th of this year, Bosnia-Herzegovina lacks 1,900 teachers, resulting in the closure of 173 primary schools. "Borba" reported on October 12th that the Republic of Serbia also lacks 2,000 teachers. The weekly "Communist," a mouthpiece of the "League of Communists of Yugoslavia," said regarding the education situation in the Prijepolje district that in 1957, due to a lack of teachers, the district closed nine primary schools, and 813 students dropped out of school; in 1958, eleven primary schools were closed; in 1959, in one area alone, about ten primary schools could not open, and 1960 will be the "worst year since the war."

    "Liberation Daily," in discussing the cancellation of the teacher allocation system and the implementation of the so-called "free recruitment" system in Yugoslavia over the past three years, believes that the "free recruitment" system has caused a large flow of teachers and has become a "real danger" to the development of school education. "If the recruitment system is maintained, schools in remote areas will not be able to open for a long time."

    Teachers' Situation Deteriorates and Work Becomes Burdensome

    The situation of Yugoslav teachers is also deteriorating. "Borba" said in an article that educators in rural areas often cannot receive their salaries, and other material conditions are also very poor. As a result, as "Liberation Daily" said on October 15th, many primary and secondary school teachers are "leaving their classrooms to seek jobs in enterprises and other institutions," hoping to get higher wages there. "Communist" weekly also said that after the abolition of the teacher allocation system, primary and secondary school teachers in places like Sandžak "left the area almost en masse." According to a report in "Liberation Daily" on August 20th, Bosnia-Herzegovina needs to recruit more than 4,380 primary school teachers this year due to the large-scale mobility of teachers. The newspaper also said that due to teacher mobility, "nothing can be planned for a long time in schools, everything is unstable, and everything is temporary."

    Also due to the lack of teachers, the work of current teachers is exceptionally heavy. According to "Politika," in most eight-year schools in the Sandžak region, one teacher has to teach 100 to 140 students, and teachers have to teach 50 lessons per week, more than double the originally stipulated number of lessons.

    School Funding is Lacking and Conditions are Poor

    The material difficulties of schools are constantly increasing. "Politika" said that in the primary schools in Šabac, there are 136 classes of students, but only 32 classrooms, and even with four shifts of classes per day, there are not enough classrooms. Therefore, schools have to reduce courses and shorten class times. According to the "Communist" weekly of October 15th, Yugoslav schools lack teaching supplies and teaching aids. Primary schools can only meet 34% of their needs, secondary schools can only meet 45% of their needs, and normal schools cannot meet 85% of their needs for teaching supplies and teaching aids. According to "Politika," the Yugoslav government has not issued a single dinar to the Novi Pazar district for more than half a year this year. Schools are heavily in debt, and schools not only have no money to buy fuel and other materials, but they also do not have money to buy chalk and office supplies.

    Students' Academic Performance Declines Severely

    Under such educational conditions, the academic performance of primary and secondary school students in Yugoslavia is declining. According to "Borba" statistics, in the first semester of the 1959-1960 school year, 24.7% of the more than 99,000 primary school students in Belgrade failed their exams.

    Students in eleven secondary schools in Belgrade "did not achieve satisfactory results," and only two secondary schools had more than 50% of students passing their exams.

    Faced with these bleak educational conditions, which are rooted in Yugoslavia's so-called "special socialism" system, the "Communist" weekly had to admit that primary and secondary education in Yugoslavia "is not progressing but regressing," and today's school education is "much worse than it was twelve years ago."

### 实行“特殊社会主义”制度的结果  南斯拉夫教育事业越来越落后  《共产主义者》周报承认目前情况比十二年前要坏得多

    实行“特殊社会主义”制度的结果
    南斯拉夫教育事业越来越落后
    《共产主义者》周报承认目前情况比十二年前要坏得多
    新华社10日讯　南斯拉夫的报刊透露，南斯拉夫教育情况恶化，很多地方师资缺乏，中小学关门，越来越多的青少年遭受失学的威胁。
    师资不足大量学校关门
    贝尔格莱德《新闻晚报》10月26日以《中小学教师不够》为题写道，由于教师不够，“今年有许多地方的学校不能开学”。这种情况在塞尔维亚、波斯尼亚—黑塞哥维那、门的内哥罗等共和国都存在。据今年1月14日的《青年报》报道，在波斯尼亚—黑塞哥维那共和国缺一千九百名教师，因而有一百七十三所小学已经关门。10月12日《战斗报》报道，塞尔维亚共和国也缺二千名教师。作为“南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟”喉舌的《共产主义者》周报在谈到普里耶波利县的教育情况时说，在1957年，由于缺乏教师，这个县关闭了九所小学，有八百一十三名学生失学；1958年关闭了十一所小学，在1959年，只一个区就有约十所小学不能开课，而1960年则将是“战后最坏的一年”。
    《解放报》在谈到三年来南斯拉夫取消分配师资制度，实行所谓“自由招聘”制度时认为，“自由招聘”制度引起师资的大量流动，成为发展学校教育的“真正危险”，“如果保持招聘制度，偏僻地区的学校将长期不能开课。”
    教师处境恶化工作繁重
    南斯拉夫教师的处境也在恶化。《战斗报》在一篇文章中说，农村的教育工作者经常不能领到工资，其他物质条件也很差。于是就像10月15日的《解放报》所说的，许多中小学教师纷纷“离开自己的教室到企业和其他机关去谋求职业”，希望在那里得到较高的工资。《共产主义者》周报也说，取消分配师资制度后，像桑贾克这样地方的中小学教师“几乎成批地离开这一地区了”。据《解放报》8月20日报道，在波斯尼亚—黑塞哥维那共和国，由于教师的大规模流动，今年需要招聘四千三百八十多名小学教师。这家报纸还说，由于教师流动，“在学校中，什么都不能长期打算，一切都不稳定，一切都是临时凑合。”
    也由于师资缺乏，目前在职教师的工作异常繁重。据《政治报》报道，在桑贾克地区的大多数八年制学校中，一个教师要教一百到一百四十名学生，教员每周要教五十节课，超过原来规定上课节数的一倍。
    学校经费缺少条件恶劣
    学校的物质困难在不断增加。《政治报》说，在沙巴茨城的小学中有一百三十六班学生，但只有三十二个教室，甚至每天分四批上课，教室还不够用。因此，学校只好减少课程，缩短上课时间。据10月15日的《共产主义者》周报透露，南斯拉夫学校的教学用品和教具十分缺乏，在小学只能满足34％的需要，在中学，只满足45％的需要，师范学校则有85％的教学用品和教具得不到满足。另据《政治报》报道，在诺维帕扎尔区，南斯拉夫政府今年半年多未发给一个第纳尔，学校负了大量的债务，学校不仅没有钱购买燃料和其地材料，而且连购买粉笔和办公用具等最起码的东西都没有钱。
    学生学习成绩严重下降
    在这样的教育状况下，南斯拉夫中小学学生成绩日益下降。据《战斗报》统计，1959—1960年度上学期，贝尔格莱德九万九千多名小学生中，24.7％的学生考试不及格。
    贝尔格莱德十一所中学的学生都“没有取得令人满意的成绩”，考试及格的学生超过50％者，只有两所中学。
    面对这些根源在于南斯拉夫所谓“特殊社会主义”制度的惨淡的教育状况，《共产主义者》周报也不得不承认，南斯拉夫的中小学教育“不是进步而是落后”，今天的学校教育“比十二年以前，要坏得多了。
