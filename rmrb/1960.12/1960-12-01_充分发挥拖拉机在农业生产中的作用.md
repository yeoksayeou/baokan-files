Give Full Play to the Role of Tractors in Agricultural Production
Zhou Jifu, Secretary of the CPC Handan Municipal Committee

    Handan is a major grain and cotton producing area in Hebei Province. The city has 18 million mu of cultivated land, of which 65% is used for grain. Grain crops are harvested twice a year with a high multiple cropping index. With the implementation of the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture and large-scale high-yield plots, farming is becoming more meticulous. Combined with the development of diversified economies in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, both labor and animal power are feeling insufficient. Due to the shortage of labor and animal power, some cultivated land cannot be replanted even though it could be, and some is planted hastily, affecting production increases. Therefore, accelerating agricultural mechanization, improving agricultural labor productivity, and resolving the shortage of labor and animal power have become the main problems for our city in leading agricultural production.

    In recent years, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Hebei Provincial Committee, and with strong support from the state, agricultural mechanization in Handan has greatly developed. The number of tractors has increased from eight mixed units in 1954 to 722 this year (equivalent to 1,060 standard units). There are more than 5,000 various types of tractor-drawn farm implements. The area served by machine耕 has accounted for 30% of the city's suitable machine耕 land. Mechanical operation projects have reached more than 20 items. Overall, there has been a great improvement in operation efficiency, work quality, and the number of machines. However, the development of work is uneven. For the same type of tractor, some standard units can cultivate 15,000 to 20,000 standard mu per year, while some cannot even reach 4,000 standard mu. For the same brand of tractor, some can be used for 15,000 hours without a major overhaul, while others need a major overhaul before even half of the prescribed overhaul period. In order to fully utilize the effectiveness of existing tractors, it is necessary to summarize the experience in management and use of tractors in a timely manner.

    Tractor Use Should Focus on Farmland, and Tractor Operations Should Focus on Plowing

    In order to make limited tractors better serve agricultural production, the Municipal Party Committee, under the principle of unified planning, overall planning, ensuring key areas, and taking care of general needs, determined that the use of large-scale agricultural machinery should focus on farmland, and operations should focus on plowing.

    To ensure that tractors are used for agricultural production, we proposed that more than 85% of the annual workload of each tractor must be guaranteed for farmland. In the agricultural off-season, comprehensive utilization (such as processing agricultural and sideline products) is permitted, but it is strictly forbidden to use tractors for non-agricultural transportation. This has greatly improved the quality of cultivation and reduced operating costs, allowing the tractors to be used more efficiently.

    "Focusing on plowing" ensures that limited tractors are used for plowing, where agricultural work is most concentrated, requires the most labor and animal power, and has the greatest effect on increasing production. To this end, we have determined that tractor plowing should account for more than 80% of the total workload of farmland. When other agricultural tasks conflict with plowing, they should give way to the needs of plowing. At the same time, on the premise of first meeting the requirements of plowing, other farmland operations such as sowing, inter-tilling, plant protection, harvesting, and threshing can also be carried out. We have also planned and carried out pilot projects for a few more comprehensive mechanized high-yield plots, with plowing, harrowing, sowing, inter-tilling, and pest control operations carried out comprehensively. This is necessary to accumulate experience in improving the level of agricultural mechanization and to prepare conditions for the full realization of agricultural mechanization.

    Due to the further implementation of the above policy, the production efficiency of tractors has been greatly improved, which has indeed guaranteed agricultural production. For example, during this year's autumn harvest, the farmland workload accounted for 98% of the total tractor workload. Compared with the same period last year, the cultivated area per standard unit increased by 90%.

    Implement Centralized Management of Agricultural Machinery in Planning, Management, Use, Repair, Manufacturing, etc.

    With the large increase in agricultural machinery power, the organizational leadership form of agricultural machinery in our city has also been adjusted accordingly. Since the winter of 1959, we have established municipal and county agricultural machinery bureaus, and people's communes have established agricultural machinery management stations. For the planning, management, use, repair, manufacturing, and supply of agricultural machinery, we have adopted an organizational leadership form in which the agricultural machinery department is responsible for everything from start to finish. At the same time, all 194 manufacturing and repair factories above the commune level have been placed under the leadership of the agricultural machinery department to serve agricultural production wholeheartedly. Practice has proved that this organizational form meets the needs of our city's agricultural technology transformation tasks and overcomes the past phenomenon of "multiple management of a single power unit" or several departments being responsible for a task that fell between the cracks. In the past, tractors and irrigation and drainage machinery in our city were managed and used by the agricultural and water conservancy departments, repaired by the industrial departments, and spare parts and fuel were supplied by the commercial departments. Due to excessive division of labor and too many management links, the number of intermediate links increased, problems were not solved in a timely manner, and the burden on grass-roots units increased instead. After adopting the "one-stop" organizational leadership form, the agricultural machinery department not only has a large number of management cadres, but also has a repair and manufacturing army of more than 20,000 people and a dedicated supply line, which has greatly improved the efficiency of tractor use and ensured the smooth completion of agricultural production tasks in various periods. For example, during the autumn plowing season this year, after the Municipal Party Committee issued the instruction to "rely on machine耕, supplemented by animal耕, to complete the plowing task," the agricultural machinery department mobilized more than 700 cadres to go deep into the fields to strengthen specific leadership, and organized 1,150 repair workers and 370 blacksmiths to go to the fields with the tractors to carry out repairs, ensuring the attendance of machines and achieving a complete victory in autumn plowing.

    Strengthen the Operation and Management of Tractor Stations and Improve the Efficiency of Machinery

    Strengthen the operation and management of tractor stations, improve the utilization rate of machinery, achieve low cost, low fuel consumption, good quality, and profitable operation. We have universally promoted in the city the management methods of "contracting production tasks, contracting fuel consumption, and contracting operating costs" and "determining machines, implements, personnel, and task completion time," as well as the cost accounting system at the three levels of tractor stations, machine耕 teams, and machine groups, or the two levels of "machine耕 teams and machine groups." We have established a system of responsibility for machinery maintenance and safe production, and conscientiously implemented various machine operating procedures. We have conducted evaluation and grading of drivers. At the same time, in order to further encourage the production enthusiasm of employees, we have formulated reward methods for exceeding quotas and saving materials while strengthening political and ideological work. These efforts have played a great role in improving the management level of tractor stations and consolidating commune-run stations.

    The machine耕 team and the machine group are the basic combat units of the tractor station. Organizing and leading the production of the team and the vehicle is the main symbol of running the tractor station well and is the key to improving the efficiency of machinery. During this year's autumn and winter plowing production, the party committees at all levels regarded grasping tractor production as the key to leading agricultural production, and sent a large number of cadres to strengthen the front line of machine耕. Each one to two tractors had a cadre responsible for ensuring that progress was made daily for each vehicle, attendance was checked for each shift, farm work was arranged for each plot, and the combination of labor, animal power, and tractors was done well for each team. The political and ideological leadership of the drivers was strengthened and labor competitions were launched. Therefore, the progress of autumn耕 was fast and attendance was higher than in other quarters of the year. The cadre-in-charge responsibility system has become a successful experience in our city's leadership of machine耕 operations.

    In order to adapt to the needs of large-scale high-yield plots and mechanized operations, we take the production team as a unit, and from the perspective of being conducive to increasing production, facilitating field management by the team, and facilitating machine耕, we make overall arrangements and rational plans for land, roads, and canal systems. For some plots that are too small or unevenly interspersed, we organize land linkage and unified machine耕, and then pay machine耕 operation remuneration and distribute the land to each team for independent management. This solves the contradiction that some land is not suitable for large-scale machine耕 production due to its small size.

    Adopt the Method of "Foreign Head and Local Tail, Combining Local and Foreign" to Vigorously Promote the Matching of Tractor-Drawn Implements

    Focusing on local resources, combining local and foreign methods, vigorously promoting "foreign head and local tail," matching complete sets of equipment, and realizing "one machine with multiple attachments" is an important key to improving the utilization rate and production efficiency of tractors at present. The existing tractors in our city not only have many models, but also have more "heads" (tractors) than "tails" (implements), and the tractor-drawn implements are not mutually compatible. Some, although equipped with tractor-drawn implements, have been damaged after years of use and have not been replenished in a timely manner. Therefore, the utilization rate of tractors is very low. According to the principle of "achieving the greatest benefits in the shortest time with the least financial and material resources," we began to vigorously promote the "foreign head and local tail" and matching of tractor-drawn implements in 1958. Starting from needs and possibilities, we use local resources whenever possible, and foreign resources whenever possible; we make them as large as they need to be and as small as they need to be; we first develop those that have the greatest impact on increasing production and saving the most labor; we actively reform and manufacture whatever models use the least materials, have the highest efficiency, take the shortest time, and are easy to modify. As a result, in the past two years, the broad masses have created and promoted more than 20 types and more than 5,000 pieces of tractor-drawn implements that combine local and foreign methods and are suitable for the agricultural characteristics of our region. Among them, more than 10 major farming projects such as plowing, harrowing, covering, and rolling have been matched into complete sets of equipment, which has found a shortcut for the serialization of tractor-drawn implements. In vigorously promoting the matching of tractor-drawn implements, we have adopted the method of concentrating forces and taking them down one by one. First, we focused on matching the tools for plowing, which require the most labor and animal power and have the greatest impact on increasing production. We equipped tractors with two sets of plowing plows (i.e., one set of large plows and one set of light plows) according to local conditions, which are suitable for both general plowing and quick plowing, as well as for deep plowing on hard soil and high-yield land. The tractor-drawn small five-bottom plow used in this year's autumn plowing has the characteristics of being sturdy, durable, efficient, high-quality, low-cost, using less materials, saving labor, and easy to operate. The cost of modifying a small five-bottom plow is only 400 yuan, which saves 600 kilograms of steel compared to a tractor-drawn large three-bottom plow, and the work efficiency is doubled. During the summer harvest, we focused on wheat threshing and threshing, which requires a lot of labor and animal power, is time-sensitive, and is extremely vulnerable to natural disasters. We vigorously promoted tractor-drawn local and foreign combined rolling for threshing, and achieved good results. One tractor with three to five rollers can generally thresh more than 200,000 jin per day, which is equivalent to the efficiency of ten large power threshers. During this year's summer harvest, 602 tractors were dispatched to participate in threshing, and the threshed wheat accounted for 29% of the city's total wheat output, enabling 4,568 production teams in 86 communes (accounting for 61% of the city's total number of teams) to complete the summer harvest and summer grain storage tasks ahead of schedule.

    These "foreign head and local tail" implements are tailored to local conditions, use local materials, are easy to manufacture, and are easy to use. Moreover, most of them can be used by both machines and animals. Experience has proved that closely relying on the masses, launching mass movements, implementing a combination of local and foreign methods, moving from local to foreign, combining large, medium, and small scales, and basing ourselves on tool reform, while popularizing and improving, is the correct policy for achieving agricultural mechanization in a faster, better, and more economical way.

    Focusing on Maintenance, Combining Maintenance and Repair, Closely Integrating Daily Maintenance with Regular Overhauls

    With the increasing number of tractors and the continuous improvement of utilization, the technical condition of tractors will inevitably experience normal wear and tear. Therefore, conscientiously solving the problem of repair and parts is an important link in ensuring that tractors are frequently in operation. Based on our experience over the past few years, repair work must implement the policy of "self-reliance, using local methods, focusing on maintenance, and combining maintenance and repair," and closely integrate daily maintenance with regular overhauls. On the one hand, in daily operations, we conduct political education for the vast number of drivers to cherish state property, establish the idea of "loving the machine as one's life and prevention is more important than cure," and conscientiously implement the regular maintenance system to extend the life of the machine. On the other hand, in order to meet the growing needs of agricultural machinery, we emphasize self-reliance and use local methods to establish an agricultural machinery repair industry. Since 1958, in line with the requirement of gradually realizing that major repairs do not leave the county, medium repairs do not leave the commune, and minor repairs do not leave the team, we have established repair networks at the municipal, county, and commune levels in batches. After two years of construction, the city has a parts factory and undertakes the repair of some precision parts. Each county (district) has used local equipment to establish one to two agricultural machinery repair factories. Each people's commune has also established agricultural machinery repair factories (stations), or established specialized workshops, and repair groups have been generally established in machine耕 teams and production teams with more machine耕. During the busy farming season, special repair teams are also organized to contract repairs on a fixed area and make rounds of repairs, so that repairs can be done as soon as they are broken. This has greatly improved the attendance rate of vehicles.

    Vigorously Train Agricultural Machinery Technical Personnel to Ensure that Machines are Not Waiting for People

    In recent years, through various methods, we have trained nearly 30,000 agricultural machinery technical personnel of various types, so that tractors have one machine with four operators, drainage and irrigation machinery have one machine with three operators, and have correspondingly trained a large number of management personnel. We also plan to train more batches every year and maintain reserves, thus ensuring the growing needs of agricultural machinery.

    Our methods for training agricultural machinery technical personnel are mainly: combining formal training with on-site teaching by masters and apprentices, combining long-term training with short-term training, combining self-reliance with striving for external assistance, and combining consolidating and improving veteran skills with actively training new hands. We mainly use "masters leading apprentices, teaching with vehicles, using local materials, and those who are capable are teachers" as the main methods. We study while producing, assign fixed training tasks according to vehicles, adopt fixed-point and fixed-time teaching of technology, and closely integrate it with production practice, so that the trained personnel can use and use simple repairs. Personnel sources, in addition to widely absorbing demobilized soldiers with professional skills, mainly come from gradual promotion and gradual replenishment. Tractor drivers are trained from agricultural tool masters, and repair workers, technicians, and machine team leaders are promoted and trained from drivers. In absorbing new personnel, attention is paid to absorbing young middle and poor peasants from rural areas who have good political conditions, a certain level of education, and are enthusiastic about agricultural mechanization, so as to ensure both quantity and quality after learning. In order to ensure that the trained personnel are used in agriculture, the Municipal Party Committee stipulates that the current agricultural machinery drivers and drivers are not allowed to be transferred or changed careers without the approval of the first secretary of the commune. When training, a contract is signed with the commune to "guarantee delivery, guarantee training, and guarantee return." After training, they return to their original production team to produce, and the machine comes and the people come. Because of the above methods, various agricultural mechanization talents in our city can be continuously replenished.

    In the past few years, although we have explored some experience in managing and using tractors, this experience is still very insufficient. We are currently encouraged by the Party's policy of vigorously developing grain and agriculture. Starting from grasping the current utilization of tractors, we will strengthen the leadership of agricultural machinery work in all aspects and promote the rapid development of agricultural technology transformation in our city.

    充分发挥拖拉机在农业生产中的作用
    中共邯郸市委书记处书记　周吉福
    邯郸是河北省粮、棉的主要产地。全市一千八百万亩耕地，粮田占65％，粮食作物一年两熟，复种率很高，在推行农业八字宪法和大面积丰产方以后，耕作越来越细，加上农、林、牧、副、渔多种经济的发展，劳力和畜力都感不足。由于劳力、畜力不足，有的耕地本来可以复种而不能复种，有的耕地带茬粗种，因而影响增产。因此加速实现农业机械化，提高农业劳动生产率，解决劳力畜力的不足，就成为当前我市领导农业生产的主要问题。
    几年来，邯郸市在党中央、河北省委的正确领导下，在国家的大力支援下，农业机械化有了很大发展，拖拉机已由1954年的八个混合台发展到今年的七百二十二台（折一千零六十个标准台）。各种机引农具已达五千多件。机耕服务面积已占全市适宜机耕土地的30％。机械作业项目已达到二十多项。总的看来，在作业效率、工作质量、机具数量上都有很大提高。但工作的发展是不平衡的。同样的拖拉机，有的一个标准台一年能耕种一万五千到二万个标准亩，有的一年还达不到四千个标准亩。同样牌号的拖拉机，有的使用一万五千个小时不大修，有的还不到规定大修期的一半就得大修。为了充分发挥现有拖拉机的效用，及时总结管理、使用拖拉机方面的经验是必要的。
    拖拉机的使用以农田为主，拖拉机的作业以耕地为主
    为了使有限的拖拉机更好地为农业生产服务，市委在统一安排、全面规划、保证重点、照顾一般的原则下，确定大型农业机械的使用以农田为主，作业以耕地为主的方针。
    为了保证拖拉机用于农业生产，我们提出每台拖拉机全年工作量中必须保证85％以上用于农田，在农闲季节可以搞综合利用（如农副产品加工等），严禁用拖拉机搞非农业的运输。这样就大大提高了耕作质量，降低了作业成本，使拖拉机的效能得到了更充分的发挥。
    “耕地为主”，是保证把有限的拖拉机用到农活最集中、占用劳动力和畜力最多、增产效果最大的耕地上去。为此，我们确定拖拉机耕地要占农田总工作量的80％以上，其他农活与耕地发生矛盾的时候，应该服从耕地的需要。同时，在首先满足耕地要求的前提下，也可以作一些其他农田作业项目，如播种、中耕、植保、收割、脱粒等。我们也有计划的搞了几个较全面机械化丰产方的试点，耕、耙、播种、中耕、治虫等项作业全面进行。这是为积累提高农业机械化水平，为全面实现农业机械化准备条件所必需的。
    由于上述方针的进一步贯彻，使拖拉机的生产效率大大提高，确实保证了农业生产。例如今年三秋的农田工作量就占拖拉机总工作量的98％，和去年同期比较，每个标准台机耕面积提高了90％。
    对农业机械的规划、管理、使用、修配、制造等实行归口管理
    随着农业机械动力的大量增加，我市农业机械的组织领导形式也进行了相应的调整。从1959年冬季开始，我们成立了市、县农业机械局，人民公社成立了农业机械管理站，对农业机械的规划、管理、使用、修配、制造、供应等工作，采取由农业机械部门“一条鞭”包到底的组织领导形式，同时还把公社以上一百九十四个制造修配工厂全部划归农业机械部门领导，全力为农业生产服务。实践证明，这种组织形式适应了我市农业技术改造任务的需要，克服了过去“一台动力多头管理”或几管几不管的现象。过去，我市的拖拉机和排灌机械由农业、水利部门负责管理使用，由工业部门负责修配，由商业部门负责供应配件及燃料。由于分工过细、管理头绪过多，增加了中转环节，解决问题不及时，反而给基层使用单位增加了负担。采取“一条鞭”的组织领导形式以后，农业机械部门不仅拥有大批管理干部，还掌握了一支二万多人的修配、制造大军和一条供应专线，这就大大提高了拖拉机使用效能，保证拖拉机顺利的完成了各个时期的农业生产任务。例如今年秋耕期间，市委提出了“依靠机耕，辅之以畜耕，完成耕地任务”的指示后，农业机械部门动员了七百多名干部深入田间加强具体领导，并组织了一千一百五十名修配工和三百七十盘烘炉随拖拉机到田间大搞修配，保证了机车出勤，取得了秋耕全胜。
    加强拖拉机站的经营管理，提高机具效能
    加强对拖拉机站的经营管理工作，提高机具利用率，作到成本低、耗油少、质量好、经营有利。我们在全市普遍推行了“包生产任务、包燃料消耗、包作业成本”，“定机车、定农具、定人员、定任务完成时间”的管理方法和拖拉机站、机耕队、机车组三级或“机耕队、机车组”两级的成本核算制度，建立了机具维护保养和安全生产责任制度，认真贯彻执行了各种机车的机务操作规程。对驾驶员进行了考核定级工作，同时为了进一步鼓励职工的生产积极性，在加强政治思想工作的同时，制订了超额、节约等奖励办法。这些工作对提高拖拉机站管理水平，巩固公社办站，起了很大作用。
    机耕队、机车组，是拖拉机站的基层作战单位，组织领导好队、车生产，是办好拖拉机站的主要标志，也是提高机具效率的关键。在今年秋耕冬耕生产中，各级党委把大抓拖拉机生产列为领导农业生产的重点，派出大批干部加强了机耕第一线，使每一至二台拖拉机，都有一名包车干部，负责作到对单车逐日抓进度，逐班查出勤，逐块安排农活，逐队作好劳动力、畜力、拖拉机三结合，并对驾驶人员加强了政治思想领导，开展了劳动竞赛。因此，秋耕进度快、出勤高于全年其它季度。干部包车责任制，已成为我市在领导机耕作业中的一条成功经验。
    为了适应大面积丰产方和进行机械化作业的需要，我们以生产小队为单位，从有利增产，便于小队田间管理，有利机耕出发，对土地、道路、渠系进行统筹安排，合理规划。对部分地块过小的、穿插不齐的土地，组织土地连方、统一机耕，然后分付机耕作业报酬，分队各自经营。这样作就解决了部分土地因地块太小不适于机耕大生产作业的矛盾。
    采取“洋头土尾、土洋结合”的方法，大搞拖拉机牵引农具配套
    以土为主、土洋结合，大搞“洋头土尾”，配套成龙，实现“一机多引”，是当前提高拖拉机的利用率和生产效率的重要关键。我市现有的拖拉机不仅型号多，而且头多尾少，机引农具互不配套，有的虽配上了机引农具，但经过多年使用已经损坏，没有得到及时补充，因此，拖拉机利用率很低。我们根据“用最少的财力、物力在最短的时间内取得最大的效益”的原则，从1958年就开始大搞机引农具的“洋头土尾”、配套成龙试验。我们从需要和可能出发，能土就土，能洋就洋；该大就大，该小就小；哪些对增产作用最大、节省的劳动力最多就先搞哪些；什么型号用材最少、效率最高、费时最短、改制容易，就积极改革、制造什么型号。结果，两年来广大群众创制推广了二十多种、大小五千多件适合我区农业特点的土洋结合的机引农具。其中耕、耙、盖、镇压等十多种主要耕作项目已经配套成龙，为机引农具系列化找到了捷径。我们在大搞机引农具配套中，采取了集中兵力，一个一个吃掉的办法。首先抓住了占用劳动力和畜力最多、增产最大的耕地工具的配套，因地制宜的给拖拉机配备了两套耕地犁（即一套大犁，一套轻便犁），既适应普耕、快耕，又适用硬土壤地及丰产地深耕。今年秋耕中使用的机引小五铧犁，就具有坚固、耐用、高效、保质、成本低、用料少、节省劳力、操作方便等特点。改造一台小五铧犁，成本只有四百元，比一台机引大三铧犁节省六百公斤钢材，工效提高二倍。在夏收中我们突出抓住了占用劳动力和畜力多，时间性强，而且极易受自然灾害袭击的小麦脱粒打场这一工序，大搞拖拉机土洋结合的镇压器打场，获得很好效果。一台拖拉机带三至五个镇压器，一般一天能脱粒二十多万斤，相当于十台大型动力脱谷机的效率。今年夏收时，全市出动六百零二台拖拉机投入打场，脱粒的小麦占全市小麦总产量的29％，使八十六个公社的四千五百六十八个生产队（占全市总队数61％）提前完成了夏收，夏征入库任务。
    这些洋头土尾的农具，都是因地制宜，就地取材，制造容易，使用方便，而且大多数都能机畜两用。经验证明，紧紧依靠群众，大搞群众运动，实行土洋并举，由土到洋，大中小结合，以工具改革为基础，边普及、边提高，是多快好省的实现农业机械化的正确方针。
    以养为主、养修并举，日常维护保养工作与定期检修密切结合
    随着拖拉机的日益增加和利用率的不断提高，拖拉机的技术状态，必然出现正常的磨损和损坏。因此，认真解决修配问题是保证拖拉机经常出勤的重要一环。根据我们几年来的体验，修配工作必须贯彻“自力更生、土法上马，以养为主、养修并举”的方针，把日常维护保养工作与定期检修密切结合起来。一方面在日常作业中，对广大驾驶人员进行爱护国家资财的政治教育，树立“爱机如命和防重于治”的思想，认真执行定期保养维护制度、以延长机具寿命。另一方面，为适应农业机械日益增长的需要，强调自力更生、用土法上马建立农业机械的修配工业。我们从1958年开始，本着逐步实现大修不出县、中修不出社、小修不出队的要求，在市、县、社三级分批建立了修配网。经过两年来的建设，市有了配件厂，并担任部分精密部件的修理任务。各县（区）都用土设备建立了一至两个农业机械修配厂。各人民公社也建立了农业机械修配厂（站），或者建立了专门车间，在机耕队和机耕较多的生产队普遍建立了修配组。在农忙季节，还组织专修队，定片包干巡回修理。作到随坏随修。这样就大大提高了机车的出勤率。
    大力培训农业机械技术人材，做到不让机器等人
    几年来，我们通过各种方法，培训了各种农业机械技术人员近三万名，使拖拉机达到一机四手，排灌机械一机三手，并相应地培养了大批管理人员。我们每年还有计划地多培训一批，保有后备。因此保证了农业机械日益增长的需要。
    我们培训农业机械技术人材的方法，主要是：正规训练与以师带徒的现场教学相结合、长期训练与短期训练相结合、自力更生与力争外援相结合、巩固提高老手和积极培训新手相结合。并且以“以师带徒，随车教学，就地取材，能者为师”为主要方法。边生产，边学习，按车固定培训任务，采取定点定时传授技术，与生产实践密切结合，使训练的人员能使会用，会简单修理。人员来源，除广泛吸收有专业技术的退役军人外，主要是逐级提拔，逐级补充。由农具手中培训驾驶员，由驾驶员中提训修理工、技术员和机务队长。在吸收新人员中，注意了吸收农村中的政治条件好、有一定文化水平并热心农业机械化事业的中贫农青年，使学习后既保证数量，又保证质量。为了使培训人员保证用于农业，市委规定了现任的农业机械驾驶员、司机手，不经公社第一书记批准，不准调动或改行。在训练时，采取与公社签订合同的办法，“保送、保训、保返回”。训练后回原生产队生产，机到人来。由于通过以上办法，使我市各种农业机械化人材，能够得到源源不断的补充。
    几年来，我们在管理使用拖拉机中，虽然摸索到了一些经验，但这些经验还很不够。我们正在党的大办粮食，大办农业的方针鼓舞下，从抓好当前拖拉机利用着手，从各方面加强农业机械工作的领导，促进我市农业技术改造的迅速发展。
