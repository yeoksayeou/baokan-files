Latin American News in Brief
    Costa Rican Farmers Occupy Landowners' Estates
    San José Dispatch: Two hundred landless farmers in Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica, occupied a large estate called "Drowned" because landowners left large tracts of land uncultivated. Authorities arrested fifty farmers, but the remaining farmers are still holding on to the large estate.
    The Costa Rican Farmers' Union will send representatives to this large estate and provide legal protection to the farmers occupying the land. Workers and intellectuals in the capital, San José, also support the farmers' just struggle.

    Urban Poor in Lima Launch Housing Construction Struggle
    Lima Dispatch: On the 24th, five thousand Lima residents without housing occupied an area near Lima, the capital of Peru, and quickly built thatched huts with wooden sticks, mats, and cardboard, re-establishing a satellite city named "Independence City." These five thousand residents were forced in mid-November to occupy a tract of state-owned wasteland six kilometers from Lima due to excessive rents, and established a satellite city there, which was later brutally driven away by the police using tear gas.

    Mrs. Siqueiros Issues Appeal
    Havana Dispatch: Angelica Arenal, wife of David Alfaro Siqueiros, General Secretary of the Mexican Communist Party and famous muralist, recently wrote to prominent figures here, calling on progressive people around the world to fight for Siqueiros' release.
    The letter pointed out that Siqueiros has tirelessly fought for the rights of the Mexican people. Recently, he and thirty-five political prisoners, as well as arrested trade union leaders, bravely participated in a hunger strike that lasted one hundred and fifty hours. After this struggle, eight people were freed.

    Venezuelan Journalists Strike
    Caracas Dispatch: Journalists, editors, and typesetters from several newspapers and magazines in the Venezuelan capital have announced a strike to protest the management's refusal to pay them year-end bonuses.
    These newspapers and magazines belong to the Capriles system's newspaper trust, which is linked to American monopoly capital.

    General Secretary of Chilean Socialist Party Sentenced to Exile
    Santiago Dispatch: The Santiago Appeals Court of Chile has sentenced Salomón Corbalán, General Secretary of the Socialist Party, to exile in the small northern Chilean town of Freirina for one hundred days. Corbalán's trial was based on accusations made against him by the Chilean government regarding "humiliating the president." In a speech given in July of this year, Corbalán accused the government of illegally selling foreign relief flour without first distributing it to the farmers. The Socialist leader had initially been sentenced to one hundred and eighty days of exile by the judge in the preliminary hearing.
