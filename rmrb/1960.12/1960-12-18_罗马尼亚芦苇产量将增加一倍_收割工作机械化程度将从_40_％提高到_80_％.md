Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, December 16th: Romania's Danube Delta began harvesting reeds in early December, and this year's harvest will more than double last year's. There are 260,000 hectares of reeds here, accounting for one-third of the world's total reed area.

To scientifically manage and utilize this important resource, massive transformation work is currently underway in this area. By the end of this year, over 330 kilometers of canals will have been excavated to facilitate reed harvesting and transportation, reed storage yards will be expanded to 110 hectares, and flood control dikes will reach 90 kilometers.

The level of mechanization in reed harvesting will increase from 40% last year to 80% this year. This summer, more than 250 new mechanical harvesting workers were trained.

The Kiska Ni Reed Processing Combine, which relies on the Danube Delta for raw materials, is being built at an accelerated pace. The combine's cardboard factory is already in production, and the man-made cellulose factory, with an annual production capacity of 50,000 tons, will also produce its first batch of products soon.

    罗马尼亚芦苇产量将增加一倍
    收割工作机械化程度将从40％提高到80％
    新华社布加勒斯特16日电　12月上旬，罗马尼亚多瑙河三角洲开始收割芦苇，今年的收割量将比去年增加一倍以上。这里有二十六万公顷芦苇，占世界芦苇总面积的三分之一。
    为了科学地管理和利用这一重要资源，目前正在对这个地区进行着巨大的改造工作。到今年年底，为了便于收割和运输芦苇而修凿的河道将超过三百三十公里，芦苇储存场将扩大到一百一十公顷，防水堤坝将达到九十公里。
    芦苇收割工作的机械化程度将从去年的40％达到今年的80％。今年夏天，又训练了二百五十多名新的机械收割工人。
    靠多瑙河三角洲供应原料的基斯卡尼芦苇加工联合厂正在加紧建设。这个联合厂的纸板厂已投入生产，年产能力为五万吨的人造纤维素厂也将在最近生产出第一批产品。
