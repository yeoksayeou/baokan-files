Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 3rd. According to Cairo newspapers today, the UAR authorities announced in a Republic decree promulgated on the 2nd that they were taking over three more companies in the southern region of the UAR operated by Belgian capitalists. They are: Shepheard's and Egyptian Hotels Company, Egyptian Metallurgical and Mechanical Manufacturing Company, and Entreprise Company.

Prior to this, UAR President Nasser had already ordered the nationalization or takeover of some Belgian companies on the 1st.

A political commentator for the Middle East News Agency commented on the Belgian government's denial of any involvement in the event where Kasavubu announced the "severance of diplomatic relations" with the UAR, stating that "this is an attempt to justify the bad things the Belgian government has done in the Congo." The commentary stated that three days before Kasavubu returned to Leopoldville from New York, Brussels Radio announced that a decision had been made to demand the UAR withdraw its ambassador to the Congo.

The commentary also stated that since the Congo gained independence, the Belgian government has pursued a policy aimed at dividing the Congo and restoring Belgian imperialist rule, which has created the current serious situation in the Congo.

    阿联又接管三家比利时公司
    中东通讯社谴责比利时在刚果的侵略政策
    新华社开罗3日电　据开罗报纸今天报道，阿联当局在2日颁布的一项共和国法令中宣布，接管阿联南部地区的另外三家比利时资本家经营的公司。它们是：谢泼德和埃及旅馆公司、埃及冶金和机械制造公司以及企业公司。
    在这以前，阿联总统纳赛尔已经在1日下令把一些比利时公司收归国有或加以接管。
    中东通讯社的政治评论员就比利时政府否认它在卡萨武布宣布同阿联“断绝外交关系”事件上有任何关系这种态度发表评论指出，“这是企图为比利时政府在刚果所作的坏事进行辩解。”评论说，在卡萨武布从纽约返回利奥波德维尔的前三天，布鲁塞尔电台就宣布，已经作出决定要求阿联撤回它驻刚果的大使。
    评论还说，自从刚果获得独立的时候起，比利时政府就奉行目的在于分裂刚果和恢复比利时帝国主义统治的政策，这种政策造成了目前刚果的严重局势。
