Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech at the Banquet

Your Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Respected Cambodian Guests, Friends, Comrades:

Just now, Your Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk delivered a speech filled with enthusiasm and friendship towards the Chinese people, which deeply moved us. On behalf of the Chinese people, the Chinese government, and in my own name, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude for Your Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk's graciousness and extend warm congratulations on the success of this visit.

In recent days, the presence of Your Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk and the distinguished Cambodian guests has filled this place with a festive atmosphere. Wherever the noble envoys of the Cambodian people go, they receive heartfelt and warm welcomes from our people. This vividly demonstrates the Chinese people's profound respect for Prince Sihanouk, the outstanding statesman of our close neighbor and the founder of friendly and cooperative relations between China and Cambodia, and their deep friendship for the Cambodian people, who are like relatives. What is particularly encouraging is that this long-standing and profound traditional friendship between the Chinese and Cambodian peoples is blossoming more brilliantly and bearing more abundant fruit. Tomorrow, our two governments will solemnly conclude the Sino-Cambodian Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression. This is a new contribution by Your Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk during his visit to our country towards strengthening the friendly relations between the two countries. I believe that the signing of this treaty will bring the development of Sino-Cambodian friendly relations into a new stage.

In his speech the day before yesterday, Your Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk pointed out that the friendship between China and Cambodia is based on mutual trust. This is a very correct assessment. It is precisely because our two countries' mutual understanding and trust are constantly strengthening that our two countries' mutual support in international affairs and friendly cooperation in economic and cultural fields can achieve such satisfactory development as today. It is also precisely because of this that the friendly relations between our two countries have been able to successfully withstand the test of time and set a good example for the implementation of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. Facts convincingly prove that regardless of the size of a country, as long as both sides can adhere to the Five Principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, and make sincere efforts to enhance the friendship between the two peoples, their friendly relations will surely continue to grow with the passage of time. The Chinese government not only hopes to live in harmony with its neighbors but also hopes to cooperate in a friendly manner with all countries that share the same aspirations on the basis of the Five Principles. Our country's peaceful foreign policy and efforts to achieve peaceful coexistence with countries with different social systems are unwavering.

The Kingdom of Cambodia is a self-respecting country that cherishes independence, and the Cambodian people are a brave people with a long tradition of struggle against colonialism. Their patriotic struggle under the leadership of Your Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk to safeguard national sovereignty and oppose foreign interference is deeply admired by our people. Your Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk and the Royal Government of Cambodia have consistently adhered to a policy of peace, neutrality, and independence, and have played an increasingly significant and positive role in international affairs. The Chinese people and the Chinese government sincerely praise and support the important contributions made by the Cambodian People and the Royal Government of Cambodia in the cause of safeguarding national independence and defending peace in Asia and the world.

Friends, Comrades, the current international situation is very good; the forces of peace and justice have greatly surpassed the forces of war and injustice. The desire of the people of the world for peace is unstoppable. However, we must also see that the imperialist forces are still pursuing aggressive policies and war policies that enslave the people of all countries and threaten world peace. At present, the serious situation in Laos is particularly disturbing. Foreign aggressive forces are rudely interfering in Laos' internal affairs, openly supporting the Lao rebel groups, provoking and expanding the Lao civil war, creating a serious threat to peace in the Indochina region. As a close neighbor of Laos and one of the guarantors of the Geneva Agreements, the Chinese government and the Chinese people resolutely oppose this act of aggression of interfering in, subverting, and splitting Laos, and are closely watching the development of the situation in Laos. All governments and peoples of countries concerned about peace in Indochina should immediately take effective measures and actions to ensure that the Geneva Agreements are respected and that the independence and sovereignty of Laos are not violated. We firmly maintain that the Lao question should be resolved by the Lao people themselves, and no foreign country should interfere. We believe that, with the support of peace-loving and justice-upholding countries and peoples, the Lao people's just struggle to resist interference and control by foreign aggressors and to safeguard national independence and state sovereignty will surely achieve final victory.

Both China and Cambodia are countries that have gained independence not long ago, and both urgently need a long-term international environment of peace. Both need to cooperate and help each other in political, economic, and cultural fields to build their countries as quickly as possible. Under the effective leadership of Your Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk and the Royal Government of Cambodia, the Cambodian people are engaged in national construction with a spirit of self-reliance, hard work, and determination to build a prosperous nation. Every achievement made by the Cambodian people in developing their national economy and national culture makes the Chinese people feel happy and encouraged. We sincerely wish the Kingdom of Cambodia increasing prosperity and strength.

I propose a toast:

To the everlasting friendship between the Chinese and Cambodian peoples,

To peace in Asia and the world,

To the health of Your Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk and his wife,

To the health of Vice-Chairman Penn Nouth, Prime Minister Pho Proeung, Vice-Prime Minister Nhiek Tioulong, and all distinguished Cambodian guests,

To the health of Ambassador Leng Ngeth and his wife,

Cheers!

### 周恩来总理在宴会上的讲话

专栏：

    周恩来总理在宴会上的讲话尊敬的诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王殿下，尊敬的柬埔寨贵宾们，朋友们，同志们：
    刚才，西哈努克亲王殿下讲了许多对中国人民充满热情和友好的话，使我们深为感动。我谨代表中国人民、中国政府同时以我个人的名义，对于西哈努克亲王殿下的盛情表示衷心的感谢，对于亲王殿下这次访问的成功表示热烈的祝贺。
    这几天来，由于西哈努克亲王殿下和柬埔寨贵宾们的光临，使我们这里洋溢着节日般的欢乐气氛。不论柬埔寨人民的高贵使者们走到那里，都受到我国人民发自内心的热烈欢迎。这就生动地表明，中国人民对于自己亲密邻邦的杰出政治家、中柬两国友好合作关系的奠基者西哈努克亲王殿下，怀有崇高的敬意；对于亲戚般的柬埔寨人民怀有深厚的友情。特别令人鼓舞的是，中柬两国人民的这种悠久深厚的传统友谊正在开出愈来愈灿烂的花朵，结出愈来愈丰硕的果实。明天，我们两国政府将隆重地缔结中柬友好和互不侵犯条约。这是西哈努克亲王殿下访问我国期间对于加强两国友好关系的新贡献。我相信，这个条约的签订将使中柬两国友好关系的发展进入一个新阶段。
    西哈努克亲王殿下在前天讲话中指出，中柬两国的友谊是建立在相互信任的基础之上的。这是十分正确的评语。正是因为我们两国的相互了解和信任不断加强，我们两国不论在国际事务中的相互支持或者在经济、文化方面的友好合作才能够获得像今天这样令人满意的发展。也正是因为这样，我们两国的友好关系才能够胜利地经受时间的考验，为不同社会制度国家之间实行和平共处，树立良好的范例。事实令人信服地证明，国家不分大小，只要双方都能够信守互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的五项原则，并且为加强两国人民的友谊进行真诚的努力，它们之间的友好关系就一定会随着时间的推移而不断增进。中国政府不仅希望同自己的邻国和睦相处，并且希望在五项原则的基础上同一切具有同样愿望的国家友好合作。我国的和平外交政策和争取同不同社会制度国家和平共处的努力是决不动摇的。
    柬埔寨王国是一个珍视独立的自尊的国家，柬埔寨人民是一个具有长期反对殖民主义斗争传统的勇敢的人民。他们在西哈努克亲王殿下的领导下，为维护国家主权、反对外来干涉而进行的爱国斗争，使我国人民深为钦佩。西哈努克亲王殿下和柬埔寨王国政府一贯坚持和平中立和独立自主的政策，在国际事务中发挥着越来越显著的积极作用。中国人民和中国政府衷心地赞扬和支持柬埔寨人民和柬埔寨王国政府在维护民族独立、保卫亚洲和世界和平的事业中所作出的重要贡献。
    朋友们，同志们，目前的国际形势很好，和平的、正义的力量已经大大地超过了战争的、非正义的力量。全世界人民要求和平的愿望是不可阻挡的。但是，我们也不能不看到，帝国主义势力仍然奉行着奴役各国人民和威胁世界和平的侵略政策和战争政策。目前，老挝的严重局势特别令人不安。外国侵略势力粗暴地干涉老挝内政，公开支持老挝叛乱集团，挑起并扩大老挝内战，造成了对印度支那地区和平的严重威胁。作为老挝的近邻和日内瓦协议的保证国之一，中国政府和中国人民坚决地反对这种对老挝进行干涉、颠复和分裂的侵略行为，并且密切地注视着老挝局势的发展。一切关心印度支那和平的各国政府和人民都应该立即采取有效措施和行动，以便确保日内瓦协议得到尊重和老挝的独立、主权不受侵犯。我们坚决主张，老挝问题应该由老挝人民自己解决，任何外国都不能加以干涉。我们相信，在爱好和平、主持正义的国家和人民的支持下，老挝人民抗拒外国侵略者的干涉和控制、维护民族独立和国家主权的正义斗争，一定能够取得最后的胜利。
    中柬两国都是获得独立不久的国家，都迫切需要一个长期的国际和平环境，都需要在政治、经济、文化各方面互相合作，互相帮助，以便尽快地把自己的国家建设起来。柬埔寨人民在西哈努克亲王殿下和柬埔寨王国政府卓有成效的领导下，正在以自力更生、励精图治的精神从事着国家的建设事业。柬埔寨人民在发展民族经济和民族文化方面所取得的每一项成就，都使中国人民感到高兴和鼓舞。我们真诚地祝贺柬埔寨王国日益繁荣和昌盛。
    我提议：
    为中柬两国人民的友谊万古长青，
    为亚洲和世界和平，
    为西哈努克亲王殿下和夫人的健康，
    为宾努副主席阁下、福·波伦首相阁下、?·刁隆副首相阁下和所有柬埔寨贵宾的健康，
    为兰·?特大使和夫人的健康，
    干杯！
