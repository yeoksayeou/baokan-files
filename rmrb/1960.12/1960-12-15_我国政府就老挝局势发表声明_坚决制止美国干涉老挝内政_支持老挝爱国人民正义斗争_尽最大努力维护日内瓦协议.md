Xinhua News Agency, December 14th - Statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China on the Laotian Situation
December 14, 1960

    Currently, a large-scale civil war has broken out in Laos, and the situation is extremely serious. This is caused by the crude interference of U.S. imperialism and its lackey, the reactionary Thai authorities, in the internal affairs of Laos.
    The people of Laos and the people of the world can clearly see that recently, U.S. imperialism and Thailand, a member of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc under the direction of the United States, have been frantically interfering in the internal affairs of Laos. After U.S. imperialism failed to put pressure on the Kingdom of Laos government through military and political threats and economic blockades, it even massively transported weapons and even dispatched armed personnel to support the Nosavan traitorous clique to directly participate in and expand the Laotian civil war.
    The policy of peace and neutrality, national harmony, and national unity put forward and adhered to by the Kingdom of Laos government has been supported by the Laotian people. However, U.S. imperialism, which is bent on dragging Laos into the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc and establishing military bases in Laos, is unwilling to see Laos become a peaceful and neutral country. It openly uses force to support the Nosavan traitorous clique, wanting to establish a puppet regime in Laos to serve its military aggression policy.
    The U.S. imperialism's crude interference in the internal affairs of Laos has trampled on the sovereignty and independence of Laos, undermined the 1954 Geneva Accords on the Laotian issue, and seriously threatened peace in the Indochina region.
    The People's Republic of China is a participating country in the 1954 Geneva Conference and a guarantor of the Geneva Accords. The Kingdom of Laos is a close neighbor of China. The Chinese people feel extremely indignant at the crimes of U.S. imperialism in interfering in the internal affairs of Laos and threatening peace in Southeast Asia. The Chinese government severely condemns U.S. imperialism and the reactionary Thai authorities for barbarously interfering in the internal affairs of Laos, creating the Laotian civil war, and committing the heinous act of aggression against Laos. The Chinese government firmly supports the policy of peace and neutrality, national independence, and national unity of the Kingdom of Laos, and firmly supports the just struggle of the patriotic people of Laos against the interference and aggression of U.S. imperialism.
    On December 11, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam sent a telegram to Premier Zhou Enlai of our country and the leaders of other relevant countries. On December 14, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement condemning U.S. imperialism's interference in Laos and calling on relevant countries to take urgent and effective actions to stop it. On December 13, the Soviet government sent a note to the U.S. government regarding the U.S.'s crude interference in the internal affairs of Laos and the threat to peace and security in Southeast Asia, and gave the U.S. government a strong condemnation. The Chinese government fully supports the solemn position of the Soviet government and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the Laotian issue. The Chinese government will resolutely work with the Soviet Union, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and other relevant countries to make the greatest efforts to safeguard the Geneva Accords and stop U.S. imperialism's interference in the internal affairs of Laos. The U.S. government and the reactionary Thai authorities should immediately stop their interference in and aggression against Laos. Otherwise, the U.S. government and the reactionary Thai authorities must bear full responsibility for the consequences caused by their interference in and aggression against Laos.

    新华社14日讯　中华人民共和国政府关于老挝局势的声明
                        1960年12月14日
    目前，老挝已经爆发大规模的内战，局势十分严重。这是美帝国主义和它的仆从泰国反动当局对老挝内政进行粗暴干涉所造成的。
    老挝人民和全世界人民都清楚地看到，最近一个时期，美帝国主义和在美国指使下的东南亚侵略集团的成员——泰国猖狂地干涉老挝的内政。美帝国主义在用军事和政治威胁、经济封锁等办法对老挝王国政府施加压力失败之后，竟然大规模运进武器以至派遣武装人员支持诺萨万叛国集团直接参加和扩大老挝内战。
    老挝王国政府所提出和坚持的和平中立、民族和睦、国家统一的政策受到老挝人民的拥护。但是，一心想把老挝拉入东南亚侵略集团、在老挝建立起军事基地的美帝国主义，不甘心老挝成为一个和平中立的国家，公然用武力扶持诺萨万叛国集团，想在老挝建立一个为它的军事侵略政策服务的傀儡政权。
    美帝国主义对老挝内政的粗暴干涉，使老挝的主权和独立遭到了蹂躏，使1954年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议遭到了破坏，使印度支那地区的和平受到严重的威胁。
    中华人民共和国是1954年日内瓦会议的参加国和日内瓦协议的保证国，老挝王国是中国的紧密邻邦。中国人民对于美帝国主义干涉老挝内政、威胁东南亚和平的罪行感到极大的愤慨。中国政府严厉谴责美帝国主义和泰国反动当局野蛮地干涉老挝内政，制造老挝内战，和侵略老挝的罪恶行为。中国政府坚决支持老挝王国的和平中立、民族独立和国家统一的政策，坚决支持老挝爱国人民为反对美帝国主义的干涉和侵略所进行的正义斗争。
    12月11日，越南民主共和国政府范文同总理致电我国周恩来总理和其他有关国家的政府领导人，12月14日，越南民主共和国外交部又发表声明，谴责美帝国主义对老挝的干涉，并且呼吁有关国家采取紧急和有效的行动加以制止。12月13日，苏联政府就美国粗暴地干涉老挝内政、威胁东南亚的和平与安全照会美国政府，并且给予美国政府以有力的谴责。中国政府完全支持苏联政府和越南民主共和国政府关于老挝问题的严正立场。中国政府将坚决地同苏联、越南民主共和国和其他有关国家一道，尽最大的努力，来维护日内瓦协议和制止美帝国主义对老挝内政的干涉。美国政府和泰国反动当局应该立即停止对老挝的干涉和侵略，否则，美国政府和泰国反动当局必须对它们干涉和侵略老挝所造成的后果承担全部责任。
