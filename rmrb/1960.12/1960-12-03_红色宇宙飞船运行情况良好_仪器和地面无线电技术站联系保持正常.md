Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd, Moscow, TASS dispatch from December 1st: The Soviet Union's third satellite spaceship continues to orbit the Earth.

    Telemetered intelligence obtained from the satellite indicates that the air, temperature, and pressure inside the satellite spaceship are maintained in a normal state.

    Data obtained after interpreting physiological numerical telemetry materials determining the condition of the experimental animals, as well as observations of the experimental animals' movements through the radio television system, indicate that the animals satisfactorily passed through the period when the satellite spaceship entered orbit.

    The "Signal" radio transmitter continues to work normally.

    The corrected measurement results of the orbital elements of the satellite spaceship are: an orbital period of 88.47 minutes, a perigee altitude of 180 kilometers, an apogee altitude of 249 kilometers, and an angle of 64 degrees 58 minutes between the orbit and the equatorial plane.

Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd, Moscow, TASS dispatch from December 2nd: The Soviet Union's third satellite spaceship is continuing to operate, and the instruments on the spaceship and the ground radio technical stations are working normally.

    The adjustment system on the spaceship maintains normal temperature and pressure inside the spaceship, and also keeps the air composition and humidity close to the rated values. Inside the spaceship, the various conditions necessary for the life of the experimental animals are constantly maintained.

    Currently, systematic observations of the animals on the spaceship are being carried out through telemetry systems and television radio devices.

    Preliminary processing of telemetry materials shows that after the spaceship entered orbit, the functions of the experimental animals' respiratory, heart, and vascular systems were normal.

    The image of the puppy inside the spaceship received through the television system has been filmed, which shows that the animal's activities under weightless conditions are calm and unhurried.

    Radio observation stations around the world are continuing to receive signals emitted by the "Signal" radio transmitter.

    The areas and times the spaceship passed over on December 2nd are as follows:

    Mexico – 6:09, Santiago – 6:25, Colombo – 7:01, Ulan Bator – 7:13, Los Angeles – 7:34, Delhi – 8:35, Cape Town – 9:44, Honolulu – 10:34.

    红色宇宙飞船运行情况良好
    仪器和地面无线电技术站联系保持正常
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科1日讯：苏联第三个卫星式飞船继续沿着轨道围绕地球运行。
    从卫星上获得的遥测情报表明，卫星式飞船内的空气，温度和压力维持着正常状态。
    译解确定试验动物状况的生理数值遥测材料后获得的数据，以及通过无线电电视系统对试验动物行动的观测，表明动物令人满意地度过了卫星式飞船进入轨道的时期。
    “讯号”无线电发射机继续正常工作。
    卫星式飞船轨道要素经过校正的测量结果是：运行周期八十八·四七分钟，近地点高度一百八十公里，远地点高度二百四十九公里，轨道同赤道平面的交角六十四度五十八分。
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科2日讯：苏联第三个卫星式飞船正在继续运行，飞船上的仪器和地面无线电技术站都在正常地进行工作。
    飞船上的调节系统使飞船内保持着正常的温度和气压，同时也使空气成份和湿度保持在接近于额定值的状况。在飞船内，不断地保持着试验动物生活所必须的各种条件。
    目前通过遥测系统和电视无线电装置，正在对飞船上的动物进行系统的观察。
    对遥测材料的初步整理表明，飞船进入轨道后，试验动物的呼吸、心脏和血管系统的功能正常。
    通过电视系统接收到的飞船内小狗的形象已拍入电影胶片，由此可以看出，动物在失重条件下的活动是安然自若的。
    世界各地的无线电观测站正在继续接收“信号”无线电发射机所发出的讯号。
    飞船2日经过的地区和时间如下：
    墨西哥——六时○九分、圣地亚哥——六时二十五分、科伦坡——七时○一分、乌兰巴托——七时十三分、洛杉矶——七时三十四分、德里——八时三十五分、开普敦——九时四十四分、檀香山——十时三十四分。
