Heavy Industrial Cities Should Also Develop Light Industry
Cheng Xihai, Secretary of the CPC Huainan Municipal Committee

Huainan City is a heavy industrial city primarily focused on the coal industry. Before liberation, it had almost no light industry, and its heavy industry base was also very weak. After liberation, following the Party's instructions and combining with the city's characteristics, we first vigorously restored and developed heavy industry centered on the coal industry, and also established some light industrial factories. In 1957, the output value of light industry increased 5.3 times compared with 1949. However, due to the extremely weak original foundation, although there was great development, it still could not meet the needs of the rapid development of heavy industry and the continuous improvement of people's living standards. In 1957, the light industrial products produced in the city accounted for only 13.5% of the total market sales and 5% of the sales varieties, and the vast majority of light industrial products needed to rely on external supply. After the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the development of heavy industry was even more rapid. The output value of heavy industry in 1958 increased by 83% compared with 1957, and in 1959 it increased by 138% compared with 1958. With the great development of industrial production, the urban population also increased greatly, especially the number of employees, which more than doubled before the Great Leap Forward, and the demand for light industrial products surged accordingly. Therefore, relying solely on importing light industrial products from other places not only made it difficult to meet the needs in terms of quantity, but also often failed to meet the requirements in terms of variety and time. For example, the demand for small hardware products, which are often needed in production, more than doubled after the Great Leap Forward. Although fraternal regions provided strong support, there was still a shortage of about half. The situation was pressing, and it was necessary to accelerate the development of local light industry to meet the needs of the high-speed development of heavy industry and the rapid improvement of people's living standards. Under the unified leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, in addition to the light industry department accelerating its development speed, other departments also established some satellite factories according to needs and possibilities, carried out diversified operations, and vigorously increased the production of light industrial products. Therefore, in 1958 and 1959, light industry also experienced a continuous Great Leap Forward, with the output value of light industry in the two years increasing by 72% and 47% respectively compared with the previous year. Despite this, because the development of heavy industry and the increase in people's income were even faster, there was still a large gap between the production and needs of light industrial products. At this time, the CPC Anhui Provincial Committee issued instructions in the second half of last year that light industry should continue to develop at a high speed, and convened a provincial light industry conference, which gave us great inspiration. Combined with the experience of the past few years, we further realized the central government's repeated instructions: while giving priority to the development of heavy industry, it is necessary to actively develop light industry according to the possibilities of raw materials and funds, and the needs of the market. After the thinking became clearer, the leadership over light industry was further strengthened. Since the beginning of this year, the number of light industrial factories built and put into production in the city is equal to the total number of light industrial factories built in the past ten years; the total output value of light industry has increased by 66% compared with the same period last year, and the self-sufficiency rate of light industrial products has risen to 32%, and some light industrial products have reached self-sufficiency or even surplus. In this way, the development of light industry has gradually adapted to the high-speed development of heavy industry and the growing needs of the people's lives.

Heavy industrial cities can not only utilize marginal materials and leftovers, but also organize the family members of workers to participate in production.

From the practice of the past few years, we have deeply realized that vigorously developing light industry in heavy industrial areas is not only an objective requirement for the overall leap forward of the national economy, but also has many favorable conditions. From the perspective of Huainan, due to the good foundation of heavy industry, there are relatively large coal mines, iron and steel, electricity, machinery and other enterprises, which can supply sufficient fuel and power, and provide necessary equipment; there are a large amount of coal and marginal material scraps, which can be used for comprehensive utilization, providing rich resources for the development of light industry; there are a large number of workers' families and some elderly workers with certain skills, who, when organized to participate in light industrial production, are a very important force. It can be seen that as long as these favorable conditions are fully utilized, light industry can be developed accordingly while developing heavy industry.

Facts have proved that there are many benefits to vigorously developing light industry in heavy industrial areas. First, a large number of light industrial products are produced, which timely meets the needs of production and life. For example, the Datong Coal Mine Small Hardware Factory produced a total of 159,900 kilograms of galvanized wire, wire nails, track spikes, welding rods, etc. from January to October this year, which not only met the needs of the mine, but also supported fraternal units. Second, it can further tap the production potential of heavy industrial enterprises, give fuller play to the role of human and material resources, increase the production of more products, and create more wealth. Taking coal mines as an example, in the past, some old equipment, scattered steel, broken sawdust, etc. were regarded as "waste" and left idle for a long time. Now they are used to produce small hardware and light chemical products, etc., creating a large amount of wealth for the country. Third, the local production and local supply of a large number of light industrial products not only reduces the transportation burden, but also saves transportation costs and greatly reduces product costs. The chemical raw materials (such as bleaching powder, calcium carbonate, caustic soda, etc.) produced and used by the Anhui Paper Mill itself are one-third to more than half cheaper than the prices purchased from other places. From a larger perspective, developing light industry in heavy industrial areas is also conducive to improving the layout of light industry and making it more reasonable.

In the past few years, while giving priority to the development of heavy industry, we have mainly grasped the following issues in vigorously developing light industry:

It is necessary to have a strong ambition to strive for basic self-sufficiency in light industrial products

First, conscientiously solve ideological problems and establish lofty ambitions. The main ideological obstacles we encountered in the process of actively developing light industry were the dependency of some leading cadres. Some people believed that Huainan was a coal base, and as long as heavy industry was done well, the superior would allocate the needed light industrial products in a timely manner, and fraternal regions would also provide strong support, so there was no need to actively develop light industry; although some people realized that heavy industrial areas needed to run light industry, they thought it was a matter for the light industry department and had nothing to do with heavy industrial plants and mines. Another prominent ideological obstacle is "condition determinism," which holds that Huainan has a poor light industry foundation, a weak base, and low technology, and the conditions for high-speed development are not available, so it can only be done on a small scale, not on a large scale, only low-level can be done, not high-level, only "slowly," not great development. In the light industry department, some people also developed complacency when they saw that light industry had made preliminary development. They only looked at the past and did not consider the needs of the development of the situation. We conducted timely positive education on these ideas, and conscientiously summarized the experiences and lessons of the past few years, analyzed the situation and characteristics of Huainan, and repeatedly carried out education on the relationship between light and heavy industry, and criticized the erroneous ideas of relying on foreign aid and "condition determinism." Through education, the understanding level of the vast number of cadres was greatly improved, their minds were liberated, and their enthusiasm was encouraged, thus establishing lofty ambitions. On this basis, the Municipal Party Committee proposed that in order to meet the needs of heavy industry, it is necessary to actively develop light industry and strive to realize the basic self-sufficiency of light industrial products as soon as possible, so a vigorous upsurge in the development of light industry quickly appeared.

Start from reality and run factories according to needs and possibilities

Second, according to the specific situation and characteristics of Huainan, we mainly focused on three key points in developing light industry: first, vigorously carry out the comprehensive utilization of coal and other resources. Coal contains a variety of chemical components, from which a large number of by-products can be extracted. In view of this feature, we vigorously carried out the comprehensive utilization of coal and established plastic, pesticide, sulfur refining, rubber and other light chemical factories. In addition to coal, we also carried out the comprehensive utilization of by-products such as wood and grain processing. Second, vigorously develop the ceramics industry. Our city has abundant clay resources, and ceramics have a wide sales range and great use, not only supplying agricultural needs and civilian use, but also replacing steel with ceramics in several products, supplying industrial needs. Therefore, we vigorously developed the ceramics industry, and established eight ceramic factories, which not only met local needs, but also supported fraternal regions. Third, in view of the large demand for small hardware and the fact that steel and marginal material scraps can be fully utilized, we vigorously ran small hardware factories. Taking coal mines as an example, in the past, all the small hardware needed relied on foreign aid, but now many small hardware products can be self-sufficient. Because we grasped the characteristics, started from reality, had raw materials, and had a market, we also ensured that the light industrial factories we ran could produce normally and continue to leap forward.

Mobilize the enthusiasm of all parties to start and run together

Third, adopt the method of everyone starting and all routes marching to actively develop light industry. The so-called "all routes marching":

First, the light industry department runs factories, mainly running some backbone enterprises, such as cotton spinning, knitting, ceramics, light chemicals, etc., to supply the needs of the city.

Second, heavy industrial plants and mines vigorously carry out diversified operations, running small factories and affiliated workshops.

Third, non-industrial departments also run factories according to business needs. For example, the grain department has established grain and oil processing and by-product comprehensive utilization factories; the commercial department has established food and small department store factories.

Fourth, urban people's communes vigorously run street industries, organize the production of small commodities, and the processing of agricultural and sideline products.

The result of such all routes marching has fully mobilized the positive factors of all parties, forming a broad mass movement, which has greatly accelerated the speed of light industry development.

Use indigenous methods first, then foreign methods, combine indigenous and foreign methods, and gradually improve

Fourth, adhere to the principle of starting with indigenous methods and relying mainly on self-reliance. In order to win the high speed of light industry development, in addition to actively striving for the support of the superior, establishing some backbone enterprises and solving some difficulties that cannot be solved by ourselves, we mainly adhered to the principle of relying mainly on self-reliance, starting with indigenous methods, then foreign methods, and gradually improving, and adopted the method of "self-run" to actively establish some small factories. The so-called "self-run" means that if there is no fund, we raise it ourselves; if there is no factory building, we squeeze it out ourselves; if there is no equipment, we make it ourselves; if we don't understand technology, we learn it ourselves.

For example, in terms of funds, in addition to the investment allocated by the province, we also raised more than 10 million yuan from enterprise profit sharing, bonuses, and operating expenses. Many units vacated dormitories and offices as factory buildings, built sheds for production, and some even produced in the open air. In the spirit of arming ourselves, many equipment such as wire nail machines, coal glue machines, pulping machines, and grinders were boldly trial-produced by ourselves.

Fifth, strengthen the Party's leadership. In vigorously developing light industry, in addition to the responsible comrades of the Municipal Party Committee strongly supporting and strengthening leadership in all aspects, a light industry leading group was established to be responsible for studying and formulating development plans, regularly supervising and inspecting, and regularly studying and solving specific problems in the development of light industry. Each plant and mine enterprise also established a special management agency, equipped with cadres, thereby ensuring the organized, led, and planned development of light industry.

Huainan City has achieved certain results in vigorously developing light industry, but there is still a large gap compared with the needs. In the future, we must continue to go all out and strive to achieve basic self-sufficiency in light industrial products as soon as possible.

    重工业城市也要发展轻工业
    中共淮南市委书记处书记　程西海
    淮南市是以煤炭工业为主的重工业城市，在解放前几乎没有什么轻工业，重工业基础也很薄弱。解放后，我们根据党的指示，结合本市的特点，首先大力恢复和发展了以煤炭工业为中心的重工业，同时也办起了一些轻工业工厂，1957年轻工业产值比1949年增长五点三倍。但是，由于原来基础十分薄弱，虽有很大发展，仍然不能适应重工业迅速发展和人民生活水平不断提高的需要。1957年本市生产的轻工业品，只占市场销售总额的13.5％和销售品种的5％，绝大部分轻工业品需要依靠外地供应。1958年大跃进以后，重工业发展更是突飞猛进，1958年重工业产值比1957年增长83％，1959年又比1958年增长138％。随着工业生产的大发展，城市人口也大大增加了，特别是职工人数较大跃进前猛增二倍多，对轻工业品的需要量随之激增。因此，单靠从外地调进轻工业品，不仅数量上难以满足需要，而且在品种和时间上也常常不能符合要求。例如生产上经常需用的小五金产品，大跃进后的需要量陡增一倍以上，虽有兄弟地区给予大力支援，仍缺少半数左右。形势逼人，必须加速发展本地的轻工业，以适应重工业高速度发展和人民生活水平迅速提高的需要。在市委的统一领导下，除了轻工业部门加快发展速度外，其他部门也都根据需要和可能，办了一些卫星厂，开展了多种经营，大力增产轻工业品。因而在1958年和1959年，轻工业也出现了连续大跃进的局面，两年的轻工业产值分别比上年增长72％和47％。尽管如此，但由于重工业的发展和人民收入增长得更快，轻工业产品的生产和需要之间仍然存在着很大距离。正在这个时候，中共安徽省委在去年下半年发出了轻工业也要继续高速度发展的指示，召开了全省轻工业会议，给了我们很大启示。结合过去几年来的体会，使我们进一步地认识到中央所一再指示的：在优先发展重工业的同时，必须根据原料、资金的可能和市场的需要，积极发展轻工业。在思想更加明确以后，进一步加强了对轻工业的领导。今年以来，全市建成投入生产的轻工业工厂等于过去十年建成的轻工业厂的总和；轻工业总产值比去年同期增长66％，轻工业品的自给率已上升到32％，部分轻工业品已达到自给甚至有余。这样，轻工业的发展逐步适应了重工业高速度发展和人民生活日益增长的需要。
    重工业城市发展轻工业，既可以利用边材余料，又可以组织职工家属参加生产
    从几年来的实践中，我们深深体会到：重工业地区大力发展轻工业，不仅是国民经济全面跃进的客观要求，而且具有许多有利条件。从淮南来看，由于重工业的基础好，有比较大的煤矿、钢铁、电力、机械等企业，可以供应充足的燃料和动力，提供必要的设备；有大量的煤炭和边材脚料，可以大搞综合利用，为发展轻工业提供丰富的资源；有大批职工家属和一部分有一定技术的老年职工，但组织起来参加轻工业生产，是一支很重要的力量。由此可见，只要充分运用这些有利条件，就能够在发展重工业的同时，使轻工业也得到相应的发展。
    事实证明，重工业地区大力发展轻工业的好处极多。首先生产了大量的轻工业品，及时地满足了生产和生活的需要。如大通煤矿小五金厂今年1至10月份共生产了铅丝、洋钉、道钉、电焊条等十五万九千九百公斤，不仅满足了本矿的需要，还支援了兄弟单位。第二，能进一步挖掘重工业企业的生产潜力，更充分地发挥人力物力的作用，增产更多的产品，创造更多的财富。以煤矿为例，过去一些旧设备、零星钢材、碎料锯末等都被视为“废物”，长期闲弃不用，现在都利用起来，生产了小五金和轻化工产品等，为国家创造了大批财富。第三，大量轻工业品的就地生产、就地供应，既减轻了运输负担，又节约了运输费用，大大降低了产品成本。安徽造纸厂自产自用的化工原料（如漂白粉、碳酸钙、烧碱等）就比从外地采购的价格降低三分之一到一半以上。从更大的范围看，重工业地区发展轻工业，还有利于改善轻工业的布局，使之更加合理。
    几年来我们在优先发展重工业的同时，大力发展轻工业方面，主要抓住了以下几个问题：
    要有一股力争轻工业品基本自给的雄心大志
    第一，认真解决思想问题，树立雄心大志。我们在积极发展轻工业的过程中遇到的主要思想障碍，是部分领导干部存在依赖思想，一些人认为淮南是煤炭基地，只要把重工业办好就行了，需要的轻工业品，上级会及时调拨，兄弟地区也会大力支援，自己用不着积极发展轻工业；有些人虽然认识到重工业地区需要办轻工业，却认为是轻工业部门的事，与重工业厂矿无关。另一个突出的思想障碍是“唯条件论”，认为淮南轻工业基础差、底子薄、技术低，高速度发展的条件不具备，只能小干，不能大干，只能搞些低级的，不能搞高级的，只能“慢慢来”，不能大发展。在轻工业部门，也有些人当看到了轻工业有了初步发展时，又产生了自满情绪，他们只看过去，不考虑形势发展的需要。我们对这些思想，及时进行了正面教育，并认真总结了过去几年的经验和教训，分析了淮南的情况和特点，反复进行了轻、重工业关系的教育，批判了依赖外援和“唯条件论”等错误思想。通过教育，大大提高了广大干部的认识水平，解放了思想，鼓舞了干劲，从而树立了雄心大志。在此基础上，市委提出为了适应重工业需要必须积极发展轻工业，尽快地为实现轻工业品的基本自给而奋斗的战斗号召，所以就很快的出现了轰轰烈烈的发展轻工业的热潮。
    从实际出发，根据需要和可能办厂
    第二，根据淮南的具体情况和特点，我们在发展轻工业中，主要抓住了三个重点：首先是大搞煤炭和其他资源的综合利用。煤炭中含有多种化学成分，可以提取大量的副产品。针对这个特点，我们大搞煤的综合利用，办起了塑料、农药、炼磺、橡胶以及其他轻化工工厂。除煤炭外，还搞了木材和粮食加工等副产品的综合利用。第二，大力发展陶瓷工业。我市陶土资源丰富，陶瓷的销路很广，用途很大，不仅供应农业需要和民用，而且在几种产品上，能以陶代钢，供应工业需要。因此我们大力发展了陶瓷工业，共办了八个陶瓷厂，不仅满足了本地需要，而且支援了兄弟地区。第三，针对小五金的需要量大，而且可以充分利用钢材和边材脚料的特点，大办小五金厂。以煤矿为例，过去需要的小五金全部依靠外援，现在许多小五金产品能自给了。由于抓住了特点，从实际出发，有原料，有市场，也就保证了所办的轻工业厂能正常生产，持续不断跃进。
    调动各方面的积极性大家动手大家办
    第三，采取大家动手，各路进军办法，积极发展轻工业。所谓“各路进军”：
    一是轻工业部门办厂，主要是办一些骨干企业，如棉纺、针织、陶瓷、轻化工等，供应全市需要。
    二是重工业厂矿大搞多种经营，办小厂和附属车间。
    三是非工业部门也根据业务需要办厂。如粮食部门办了粮油加工和副产品综合利用的工厂；商业部门办了食品和小百货工厂。
    四是城市人民公社大办街道工业，组织小商品生产，以及农副产品加工等。
    这样各路进军的结果，充分调动了各方面的积极因素，形成了一个广泛的群众运动，大大加速了轻工业发展的速度。
    土法上马，先土后洋，土洋结合，逐步提高
    第四，坚持土法上马，自力更生为主的原则。为了赢得轻工业发展的高速度，我们除积极争取上级支援，建立一些骨干企业和解决一些本身无法解决的困难外，主要是坚持了自力更生为主，土法上马，先土后洋，逐步提高的原则，采取了“自办”的办法，积极兴办了一些小厂。所谓“自办”，就是没有资金自己筹，没有厂房自己挤，没有设备自己造，不懂技术自己学。
    如资金方面，除省里拨给的投资外，我们又从企业利润提成、奖励金、事业费中筹集了一千多万元。不少单位腾出宿舍和办公室作厂房，搭草棚进行生产，有的甚至干脆在露天生产。本着自己武装自己的精神，不少设备如洋钉机、煤胶机、打浆机、磨碎机都是自己大胆试制出来的。
    第五，加强党的领导。在大力发展轻工业中，市委除各负责同志在各方面大力支持、加强领导外，并成立了轻工业领导小组，负责研究制定发展规划和经常督促检查，定期研究解决轻工业发展中的具体问题。各厂矿企业还建立了专管机构，配备了干部，从而保证了轻工业有组织有领导有计划地发展。
    淮南市在大力发展轻工业中，取得了一定的成绩，但与需要相比较，仍有很大距离。今后一定要继续鼓足干劲，力争尽快地实现轻工业产品的基本自给。
