Xinhua News Agency, Havana, December 7th: Chilean poet Pablo Neruda said at a rally in Havana on the evening of the 6th that Cuba has become the first country in Latin America to smash American neo-colonialism.

The poet said, "The United States, taking advantage of the continent's feudal system and underdeveloped industry, has seized Latin American countries and bought off their corrupt rulers and politicians. This has caused all kinds of suffering that we have endured on our own continent." Neruda pointed out, "In Latin America, there used to be a fatalistic sentiment: it is necessary to trade with and depend on the United States. Therefore, when the Cuban revolutionary movement led by Fidel Castro, with the support of all (Cuban) people, launched a tit-for-tat struggle against imperialism, the heart of Cuba beat together with the heart of all Latin America. In my country, the Cuban revolution has excited everyone."

Neruda also said, "Intellectuals and artists should be consistent with their times, and being consistent with their times is being consistent with the ideals of the Cuban revolution." When talking about his new book "Song of Heroic Deeds," which will be published in Cuba this weekend, he said that the book is dedicated to the struggle of the people of the Caribbean countries against the enemies of imperialism, especially dedicated to the victory of the Cuban people's revolution in defeating this brutal enemy of imperialism. He said, "My book is written in simple and clear language, because I hope it will serve the Cuban struggle, and I hope that it, being the people's book, can be understood by the people."

Neruda emphasized, "Poets always participate in political struggles. Recently, a tendency has developed that attempts to keep poets away from the people. This is a political tendency disguised as non-political. This is a means of separating the fire of language from the interests of the people. As history strides forward, poets should join this pace."

    聂鲁达赞扬古巴革命
    美国造成了拉丁美洲大陆的种种苦难
    古巴的心和全拉丁美洲的心一起跳动
    新华社哈瓦那7日电　智利著名诗人聂鲁达6日晚在哈瓦那的一次集会上说，古巴成了拉丁美洲第一个粉碎美国新殖民主义的国家。
    这位诗人说，“美国利用本大陆的封建制度和工业不发达的情况，霸占了拉丁美洲国家，收买了它们的腐败的执政者和政客。这就造成了我们在自己大陆上所忍受的种种苦难。”聂鲁达指出，“在拉丁美洲，曾流传着一种宿命论的情绪：必须同美国进行贸易和依赖美国。因此，当菲德尔·卡斯特罗领导的得到全体（古巴）人民支持的古巴革命运动同帝国主义展开针锋相对的斗争的时候，古巴的心和全拉丁美洲的心在一起跳动。在我的祖国，古巴革命激动了所有的人”。
    聂鲁达还说，“知识分子和艺术家们应该同时代一致，与他们的时代相一致就是和古巴革命的理想相一致。”他在谈到他的将于本周末在古巴出版的新书《英雄事迹的诵歌》时说，这本书是献给反对帝国主义敌人的加勒比海各国人民的斗争的，特别是献给战胜帝国主义这一残酷敌人的古巴人民革命的胜利的。他说，“我的书是用简单明了的语言写的，因为我希望它为古巴斗争服务，我希望人民的它能够为人民所理解。”
    聂鲁达强调指出，“诗人在任何时候总是参加政治斗争的。最近发展了一种企图使诗人远离人民的倾向。这是一种披着不过问政治外衣的政治倾向。这是一种使语言的烈火脱离人民利益的手段。在历史大踏步地前进的情况下，诗人们应该加入这一步伐。”
