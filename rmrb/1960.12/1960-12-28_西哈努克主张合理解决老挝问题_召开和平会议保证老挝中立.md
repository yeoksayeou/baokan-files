Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, December 27th: Prince Sihanouk stated this morning at the opening ceremony of the 10th National Congress of the People's Socialist Community held here: The countries responsible for the situation in Laos and the participating countries of the Geneva Conference responsible for the peace issue in Indochina should hold a peace conference as soon as possible, with the aim of resolving the Laotian issue most reasonably, that is, ceasefire, restoration of peace, ending foreign interference and meddling, neutralizing Laos and guaranteeing this neutralization, and restoring the Lao people's right to freely elect a government that follows policies chosen by the people according to their will.

Sihanouk said that some countries have recently suggested, requested, or agreed to reconvene a meeting of the countries of the 1954 Geneva Conference. "I think convening such a conference is completely understandable; however, if countries such as the United States and Thailand are not involved and concerned about this conference and its conclusions, then the conference will not achieve the positive results that everyone expects."

Sihanouk said that Myanmar, one of Laos's close neighbors, and South Vietnam could also be invited to the conference.

He also said: "In international affairs, the Khmer people are only willing to participate in one battle, one struggle, one war, and that is the war against all forms of chauvinism, arrogance, greed, imperialism, and colonialism." That is the struggle for understanding, friendship, trust, mutual assistance, and peaceful cooperation among all peoples, governments, and countries.

    西哈努克主张合理解决老挝问题
    召开和平会议保证老挝中立
    新华社金边27日电　西哈努克亲王今天上午在这里举行的人民社会同盟第十届全国代表大会的开幕式上说：对老挝局势负有责任的国家和对印度支那和平问题负有责任的日内瓦会议各参加国应该尽早举行一次和平会议，其目的在于最合理地解决老挝问题，也就是说，停火，恢复和平，结束外国的干涉和插手，使老挝中立化并保证这种中立化，恢复老挝人民自由选举一个按照人民意愿奉行人民所选择的政策的政府的权利。
    西哈努克说，某些国家不久前已经建议或者要求或同意重新召开一次1954年日内瓦会议各国的会议。“我认为，召开这样一次会议是完全可以理解的；然而，如果不做到使美国和泰国这样一些国家参加和关心这个会议以及它的结论，那么这个会议将不能获得符合大家的期望的积极结果。”
    西哈努克说，也可以邀请老挝的紧邻之一缅甸以及南越参加这个会议。
    他还说：“在国际方面，高棉人民只愿意参加一种战斗、一种斗争、一种战争，那就是反对一切形式的沙文主义、傲慢无理、贪婪、帝国主义和殖民主义的战争。”那就是争取各国人民之间，政府之间，国家之间的了解、友谊、信任、互助以及和平合作的斗争。
