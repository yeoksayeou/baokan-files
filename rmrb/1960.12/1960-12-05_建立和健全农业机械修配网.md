Establishing and improving the agricultural machinery repair network, while ensuring sufficient labor force on the front line of agricultural production, and in conjunction with the in-depth development of the mass tool reform movement in rural areas, doing a good job in agricultural machinery repair and improving the utilization rate of agricultural machinery and equipment is a very important task for industry to support agricultural technical transformation.

Improving Agricultural Production Efficiency

In recent years, especially since 1958, agricultural machinery used in agricultural production, such as tillage machinery, irrigation and drainage machinery, and harvesting and processing machinery, has increased significantly. Among the 926 rural people's communes in Shanxi Province, 213 communes have established agricultural machinery management stations; 573 mechanical irrigation stations, 274 hydraulic power stations, and 163 hydroelectric power stations have been established throughout the province, with a total of 1,088 tractors of various models (equivalent to 1,985 standard units), and 21,440 sets of various irrigation and drainage machinery, with a total capacity of more than 244,400 horsepower; more than 28 million pieces of new agricultural tools have been reformed and promoted. Fully leveraging and utilizing these agricultural power machines can save a large amount of labor and effectively improve agricultural labor productivity. Calculating only tractors and irrigation and drainage machinery, if one horsepower of power machinery equipment meets the requirement of replacing four laborers, the province can save one million laborers. However, due to the fact that the management, maintenance, and repair of power machinery cannot keep up, the damage to power machinery is still relatively serious, and a considerable amount of tillage machinery and irrigation and drainage machinery cannot be fully utilized. According to preliminary investigations in Shanxi Province, repairing the damaged irrigation and drainage machinery can increase the irrigated area by more than 530,000 mu; repairing the tractors that need repair can increase the area of machine-cultivated land by more than 730,000 mu, which alone can save 140,000 man-days and 290,000 animal-days for agricultural production. Everyone knows that repairing a machine requires less material, less labor, less money, less time, and yields faster results than manufacturing a machine. Therefore, industrial support for agriculture should first pay attention to doing a good job in agricultural machinery repair, ensuring that existing agricultural machinery can be fully utilized.

        Combining Professional Repair with Mass Repair

To do a good job in agricultural machinery repair, it is necessary to closely combine professional repair with mass repair. Only in this way can the emergency repair and routine repair of agricultural machinery be implemented throughout the year according to different agricultural seasons. The establishment and strengthening of the repair network can ensure that the manufacturing of various spare parts and the overhaul, medium repair, and minor repair of agricultural machinery have appropriate division of labor, ensuring that agricultural machinery is repaired as soon as it breaks down, and repaired wherever it breaks down. Since this year, the Jinan Special District, in accordance with the instructions of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and based on the distribution of the machinery industry, production capacity, and the types of machinery in various regions, has adopted the method of assigning repair tasks by region, assigning fixed points, assigning levels, and assigning categories. They divided the area into six regions with Hongtong, Linfen, Houma, Yuncheng, Wenxi, and Linyi as the center, and determined a central repair factory for each region. A total of ten overhaul points and many medium repair stations were determined in the area, and the farm tool factories of the communes were all designated as minor repair stations. On this basis, they divided the different repair tasks of overhaul, medium repair, and minor repair of various agricultural machinery among the overhaul station, the county, and the commune industry. They also included the repair of agricultural machinery in the plan, and supplied materials for maintenance according to the plan. In this way, it can be guaranteed that agricultural machinery will be repaired if it breaks down, and repair materials can also be used where they are urgently needed.

            Factory-Commune Hookup

Another effective way to improve agricultural machinery repair is to continue to use and develop factory-commune hookups, regional contracting, large factories contracting counties, and general factories contracting communes, a new form of worker-peasant alliance and industrial support for agriculture. In the past two years, Shanxi Province has played a huge role in arming commune industries, repairing agricultural machinery, and spreading the technology of using agricultural machinery to farmers through this new form of industrial support for agriculture. At present, more than 1,080 factories and mines in the province have established hookup support relationships with 66 counties and 926 people's communes. During the spring plowing, mid-cultivation, and drought resistance struggles this year, factories and mines have organized more than 17,000 technicians, bringing tools and spare parts to the front line of agricultural production to inspect and repair 4,712 sets of irrigation and drainage machinery and various agricultural machinery, and the total capacity of the repaired agricultural power machinery reached more than 56,800 horsepower. After the Yuchi Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory hooked up with the Zhangqing People's Commune, it not only systematically helped the Zhangqing People's Commune to do a good job in agricultural machinery repair, helped the commune establish an agricultural machinery repair force, but also cultivated a large number of technical personnel for the commune to use agricultural machinery. This spring, the workers of the Taiyuan Boiler Factory who went to various communes in Wanrong County to help repair agricultural machinery were not afraid of fatigue or difficulties, and repaired more than 30 sets of pot camel machines, gas generators, etc., which powerfully supported the agricultural drought resistance struggle. Facts have proved that fully utilizing the new form of factory-commune and factory-county hookups to support agriculture is a new stage of transforming the past temporary and unstable support into regular and fixed support, and transforming individual and raid-like support into complete and systematic comprehensive support.

          Need Fixed Factories to Produce Accessories

The main problem currently existing in agricultural machinery repair work is that the production of accessories cannot keep up with the needs of repair. Therefore, it is necessary to actively produce accessories, increase the output and variety of accessories, improve the quality of accessories, and do a good job in supply work on the basis of understanding the wear and damage of various agricultural machinery parts and components, and understanding the demand and reserve of various accessories. When arranging the 1961 agricultural machinery production plan, the production of accessories should be included in the plan, which is the material basis for ensuring that agricultural machinery repair work is done well. The agricultural, water conservancy, commercial, and agricultural machinery departments should work together to regularly study the production and supply of accessories, and ensure that the production of accessories keeps up with the needs of repair. At the same time, the production of accessories should be managed at different levels, clarifying the scope of responsibilities for the management of accessory production at the provincial, special, and county levels. According to the models of various machines and the precision of accessory production, in principle, precise and large accessories should be produced by the province; more precise accessories should be produced by the special zone; general-purpose parts and easily manufactured parts should be actively produced by county-run machinery factories and commune farm tool machinery factories with conditions. For this reason, provinces and special zones should fix a group of agricultural machinery factories to specifically undertake the production of accessories. This can not only ensure the quantity of accessory production, but also ensure the quality of accessory products. The Jinan Special Zone has already planned seven accessory factories according to the needs of agricultural machinery repair in the entire region to specialize in the production of agricultural machinery accessories. This approach is very good.

          Promote Advanced Repair Experience

In order to do a good job in agricultural machinery repair, in terms of repair technology, we must rely on the masses, implement the "walking on two legs" policy, implement both indigenous and foreign methods, use foreign methods when possible, and use indigenous methods when possible. We must conscientiously summarize and promote the advanced repair techniques and experience in producing accessories created by the masses. For example, the use of indigenous steel and iron to carry out indigenous nodular cast iron casting of tractor track plates and support rails has been successful, and cities and counties and communes with iron smelting conditions can generally promote it. For example, the Linfen Agricultural Machinery Repair Factory uses indigenous lead plating to plate "oil pump plungers" and "fuel injection nozzle valves," so that unusable parts can be reused, and the cost is only about 5% of the original purchase price. Therefore, agricultural machinery production departments and user departments at all levels, as well as machinery factories, drivers, and operators, must always pay attention to collecting waste and old parts and components, and actively find ways to repair and reuse them.

While strengthening agricultural machinery repair work, we must strengthen the maintenance and upkeep of agricultural machinery in use. This requires first paying attention to strengthening ideological work, improving technical level on the basis of improving ideological awareness, exchanging technical experience, and establishing necessary rules and regulations. No matter what kind of machinery and equipment is used, as long as there are advanced ideas, skilled operating techniques, and appropriate management systems, the machine will become tame, and the wear of the machine will be relatively reduced, preventing accidents, and the machine will exert greater power.

    建立和健全农业机械修配网
    山西省农业机械厅厅长  贾云龙
    在保证农业生产第一线有充足的劳动力的同时，结合农村群众性的工具改革运动的深入开展，积极建立和健全农业机械修配网，做好农业机械的修配工作，提高农业机械设备的利用率，是工业支援农业技术改造的一个十分重要的工作。
    提高农业生产效率
    几年来，特别是从1958年以来，农业生产所使用的耕作机械、排灌机械和收获加工机械，都有了显著的增加。山西省九百二十六个农村人民公社中，有二百一十三个公社已经建立了农业机械管理站；全省建立了机械灌溉站五百七十三处，水力站二百七十四处，水电站一百六十三处，共有各种型号的拖拉机一千零八十八台（折合标准台一千九百八十五台），各种排灌机械两万一千四百四十台，总能力有二十四万四千多马力；改革和推广的新式农具有两千八百多万件。充分发挥和运用这些农业动力机械，就可以节省出大批的劳动力，有效地提高农业劳动生产率。仅以拖拉机和排灌机械两项计算，如果一个马力的动力机械设备达到代替四个劳力的要求，全省就可以节省一百万个劳动力。但是，由于动力机械的管理维护和修配工作赶不上去，动力机械的损坏现象还比较严重，有不少数量的耕作机械、排灌机械不能充分发挥作用。根据山西省初步调查，把已经损坏的排灌机械修复起来，就可以增加浇地面积五十三万多亩；把需要修配的拖拉机加以修配好，可以增加机耕地面积七十三万多亩，仅此一项就能够为农业生产节省出十四万个人工和二十九万个畜工。谁都知道，修理一台机器比制造一台机器用料少，用工少，花钱少，时间短，见效快。因此，工业支援农业就应当首先注意做好农业机械的修配工作，保证现有农业机械都能够充分地发挥作用。
        专业修配和群众性修配结合
    做好农业机械的修配工作，必须把专业性的修配同群众性的修配密切地结合起来。只有这样，才能保证农业机械的突击性修配和经常性修配按照不同的农业季节贯彻全年。修配网的建立与加强，就能使各种配件零件的制造和农业机械的大修、中修、小修，有适当的分工，保证农业机械随坏随修，在哪里坏在哪里修。今年以来，晋南专区根据中共山西省委的指示，根据全区机械工业的分布情况、生产能力以及各个地区各种机械的类型，采取了分片、定点、分级、分类包干修配的办法。他们以洪洞、临汾、侯马、运城、闻喜、临猗为中心，划分为六片，每片确定了中心修配厂，全区共确定了十个大修点和许多中修站，公社的农具厂都确定为小修站。他们在这个基础上，对各种农业机械的大修、中修、小修不同的修配任务，由大修站、县、社工业三级分工负责。他们还将农业机械的修配列入计划，并按计划供给维修用的材料。这样，就可以保证农业机械坏了有人修配，修理材料也可以用到急需的地方。
            厂　社　挂　钩
    搞好农业机械修配工作的另一个有效办法，是继续运用和发展厂社挂钩，分区包干，大厂包县，一般厂包社的工农联盟和工业支援农业的新形式。两年来，山西省通过这种工业支援农业的新形式，在武装公社工业，修理农业机械，向农民传播农业机械的使用技术等方面，发挥了巨大的作用。目前全省已有一千零八十多个厂矿同六十六个县、九百二十六个人民公社建立了挂钩支援关系。在今年的春耕、中耕和抗旱斗争中，各厂矿先后组织技术工人一万七千多人，带着工具零件深入农业生产第一线，检查修配排灌机械和各种农业机械四千七百一十二台，修好的农业动力机械的总能力达五万六千八百多马力。榆次经纬纺织机械厂和张庆人民公社挂钩以后，不仅有计划地帮助张庆人民公社做好了农业机械的修配工作，帮助公社建立了农业机械修配力量，而且还为公社成批地培养了使用农业机械的技术人材。今年春季，太原锅炉厂下乡到万荣县各公社帮助检修农业机械的工人，不怕累，不怕难，修复了锅驼机、煤气机等三十多台，有力地支援了农业抗旱斗争。事实证明，充分运用厂社、厂县挂钩这种工业支援农业的新形式，是变过去那种临时的、不固定的支援为经常的、固定的支援，变个别的突击性的支援，为成套的有系统的全面支援的新阶段。
          要有固定工厂生产配件
    当前农业机械修配工作中存在的主要问题是配件生产赶不上修配的需要。因此就需要在了解各种农业机械零件、部件的磨损与损坏情况，了解各种配件的需要量和储备量的基础上，积极生产配件，增加配件产量、品种，提高配件质量，并做好供应工作。在安排1961年农业机械生产计划时，要把配件生产列入计划，这是保证做好农业机械修配工作的物质基础。农业、水利、商业、农业机械部门，应当协同一致，经常研究配件的生产和供应情况，切实做到配件生产赶上修配需要。同时，还要对配件的生产实行分级管理，明确省、专、县配件生产管理的责任范围，根据各种机械的型号，配件生产的精密程度，原则上应当是精密的大型的配件，由省负责生产；较精密的配件由专区负责生产；一般通用的零件和容易制造的零件，县营机械厂和有条件的公社农具机械厂都应当积极生产。为此，省、专要固定一批农业机械厂专门担负配件生产。这样既可保证配件生产的数量，又能保证配件产品的质量。晋南专区已经根据全区农业机械修配的需要，规划了七个配件厂，专门生产农业机械配件，这种做法很好。
          推广先进修配经验
    为了搞好农业机械的修配工作，在修配技术上，必须依靠群众，贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针，实行土洋并举，能洋则洋，能土就土。要认真总结和推广群众创造的先进修理技术和生产配件的经验。例如用土钢土铁进行土球墨铸铁铸造拖拉机链轨板、支重轨，已经获得成功，凡是有炼铁条件的市县和公社，都可以普遍加以推广。又如临汾农业机械修配厂采用土法镀铅来镀“油泵柱塞”和“喷油咀活门”，使不能用的零件重新再用起来，成本只有原买价的5％左右。因此各级农业机械生产部门和使用部门，以及机械厂、驾驶员、操作手，都要经常注意把废旧的零件、部件收集起来，积极想办法加以修复和重新利用。
    在加强农业机械修配工作的同时，一定要加强农业机械使用中的维护保养工作。这就得首先注意加强思想工作，在提高思想自觉的基础上，提高技术水平，交流技术经验，建立必要的规章制度。无论使用什么机械设备只要有了先进的思想、熟练的操作技术和适当的管理制度，机器就会变得驯服，也就会相对的减少机器的磨损，防止事故发生，机器就会发挥更大的威力。（转载《山西日报》，略有文字修改）
