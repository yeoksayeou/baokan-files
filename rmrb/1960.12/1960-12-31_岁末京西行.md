A Year-End Trip to Western Beijing
Bai Jin

The Boiling Shijingshan Steel Plant

The car sped westward along the wide Chang'an Avenue. The solemn and majestic Tiananmen Square flashed past the window, and countless tall buildings flashed past the window.

In the distance, lights like stars, flickering faintly in the thin mist of dawn, their red glow dyeing half the sky red. Ah! Almost at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company. My heart suddenly began to boil. I was about to meet a familiar place and old friends I'd parted with over two years ago, how could I not be excited!

When I got out of the car at the factory's east gate, I was a little confused when I saw the rows of red factory buildings, the chimneys taller than the last, and heard the sharp whistles and the urgent ringing of bicycle bells. Was this really the original east gate? Where had that large expanse of farmland gone? When was this road, four times wider than before, built? What were those tall new factory buildings in a long row to the southeast? What factory was that, nearing completion diagonally across from the steel plant? Looking northwest, I saw hundreds of hectares covered in new buildings, almost twice as large as before, but I couldn't name a single one. Beside Blast Furnace No. 1 and Blast Furnace No. 2, another thick blast furnace stood, which I guessed must be Blast Furnace No. 3, as introduced in the newspapers.

The steel plant was surrounded by a cluster of new buildings. Tower cranes, dozens of stories high, towered into the air, a scene that reminded me of August 1958.

I participated in the Party Committee meeting held by the factory on the evening of August 22nd of that year. The meeting decided to establish a new steel plant. The meeting went on until 11 o'clock at night. After the meeting, I followed the Party Secretary and the factory directors to see the construction site that very night. The next day, when I went to the construction site for the second time, the graders had already arrived, the electrical grid had been set up, and trucks and horse-drawn carts carrying materials and equipment were rumbling in. The construction site was a bustling scene of activity. A few days later, when I went again, chimneys were already standing tall and molten steel was flowing. In less than a month, they ended the thirty-year history of Shijingshan Steel having iron but no steel.

Before I reached the factory, I saw a large red banner with the words: "Grasp Tightly, Grasp Ruthlessly, Grasp to the End, Smelt More Good Steel to Welcome the New Year." Walking into the workshop, I ran into the tapping of the steel. Red-hot molten steel was gushing from the furnace mouth, and golden sparks were flying more than a meter away. Overhead cranes were moving back and forth, loading molten iron and transporting steel ingots. The sound of machinery, the roar of the air supply, and the clashing of iron tools, all intertwined into a deafening roar...

The workshop director pointed to a converter in front of him and said: "This is our factory's famous advanced furnace – Furnace No. 1." I saw three or four young men shoveling slag from the furnace pit, and the sound of pneumatic picks like machine gun fire came from the furnace. A sign above the furnace pit read: "Clean the Furnace Quickly, Repair the Furnace Quickly, Start a New Furnace Quickly, Catch Up with Furnace No. 7, Create New Achievements in the New Year." It turned out that the workers of this converter were competing with the workers of Furnace No. 7. When I got to Converter No. 7, I saw several workers crowded together, pointing to the white flames constantly swaying at the top of the furnace, arguing loudly about something. The workshop director said: "They are holding a 'Furnace-front Judgment Meeting' before tapping the steel! Originally, the factory planned to use this team as a key point for reducing consumption, and sent an old worker and a technician to help them with the experiment. When this news reached Na Kuiquan, a steelworker from Furnace No. 1, he and the others decided to secretly work harder and compete with Furnace No. 7. They sent people to Furnace No. 7 to learn, and took operation records back to the team for research. When the factory Party Committee learned about this, they immediately assigned the old worker and technician to help Furnace No. 1 with the experiment at the same time. As soon as the competition between these two converters spread, all the converters followed suit. The consumption of pig iron per ton of steel smelted in the whole factory was reduced from 1369 kg to 1277 kg.

"Many hands make light work," the workshop director said with irrepressible joy: "Thanks to everyone's striving spirit, our work is improving day by day. This year, our utilization coefficient, quality, and furnace age have all reached the advanced level of the country."

Spring Underground

The car left the Shijingshan Steel Plant and drove west for a while, reaching the Jingxi Mining Area.

Sitting in a cage, in the blink of an eye, we descended several hundred meters to the Mentougou Coal Mine.

Down in the mine, it was bright and clear, with a fluorescent lamp every few steps, so everything could be seen clearly. This was a tunnel. It was as wide as a room and as high as a story, painted snow-white all around, and I didn't see a single person for quite some time. I remembered that when I went down the mine in 1957, the tunnel was full of people, pushing coal carts weighing more than a ton, running back and forth. Why were they all gone this time? Just as I was thinking this, sparks flashed in front of me, and the bell rang loudly. A train was coming. This train looked similar to a streetcar from the outside, but it was smaller, and pulled a string of thirty or forty coal carts behind it. It took a long time for it to pass. The mine director accompanying me said that during the technical revolution last spring, the workers pieced together some cars from scrap iron. These cars had been modified many times, each time better than the last. Now almost the entire mine was using this new type of electric locomotive. With this kind of car, the mine saved three hundred and eighty-three cart pushers, who were all "transferred" to coal mining.

I walked more than four hundred meters further into the mine, went around for a long time, and climbed into a working face. The lights were dim, so I couldn't see exactly how big the working face was. I could only see small lights flickering in the distance. Coal flowed down like a waterfall along four or five electric chutes. I climbed closer and saw the workers standing easily beside the machines. One worker pointed to the coal cutter under his feet and said:

"This thing is really a treasure. In 1957, when we didn't have this gadget, one person had to work all day to mine 3.6 tons of coal. In 1958, when we used this machine, we mined 7 tons a day. This year, we improved it a little, and now we can mine 11.6 tons." He paused and then continued: "Before, a working face producing 10,000 tons of coal was pretty good, but now producing 18,000 tons is nothing at all. The current working face is twice as big as before, but the number of people has been reduced by almost half."

Not far away, a rumbling sound of blasting could be heard. The mine director said that the workers were holding a rapid tunneling technical performance competition. They used a new method of "throwing slag blasting" to blast the rocks outside the working face, and then the rock loading machine extended its steel arm to load the rocks into coal cars and transport them out, so that tunneling could be carried out faster. As we talked and walked, we soon arrived at the rock tunneling working face. The workers were busy drilling holes, the pneumatic picks were jumping, and the sharp drills were knocking on the hard rocks, quickly drilling into the rocks. In the past, each pneumatic hammer required three people to hold it, but now only one person is needed to operate it.

Next to the elevator, a young female worker was flipping a switch. With a gentle flick, a pair of two-ton coal carts in front of her were automatically pushed into the cage as if by some strong force. In a short while, they were transported to the surface. The mine director said that in the past, four people pushed the carts, taking six seconds each time, which was quite tiring. The winch could only transport more than 700 tons of coal in eight hours. Since the workers came up with the idea of a pneumatic car pusher, it only takes three seconds each time, and more than 1,200 tons of coal can be transported in eight hours.

Back on the surface, the mine director recited a large string of numbers to me: If the total coal production of the bureau was 100 in 1957, it reached 171.24 in 1958, and increased to 267.1 in 1959. This year, it completed the national plan for the whole year one month ahead of schedule, and the annual output rose to 341. The mine director became more and more excited as he recited. He said that he had memorized these numbers by heart, but every time he recited them, his heart felt as if it was burning with fire.

I left the Mentougou Mine on the morning of the second day. I originally wanted to talk to someone, but I went to several places and saw that everyone was busy. Some were holding meetings to summarize the rich experience of the continuous leap forward in the past three years; some were starting electric drills to open up new coal mining working faces for next year; some were carefully inspecting and repairing machines; and some were busy manufacturing a large number of spare parts. The workers, in the spirit of the General Line, wiped out the old history, created a beautiful present, and now they are using the spirit of the General Line to make full preparations to welcome a more glorious and more splendid tomorrow.

New Scenes in the Commune

The car drove along a newly built road, through deep mountains and valleys, and soon arrived at the Zaitang People's Commune. It used to be so difficult to get here! More than two years ago, when I came to participate in the commune's founding conference, I had to ride a donkey, cross mountains, and wade through rivers. Now the car goes all the way to the commune's gate.

When I arrived at the commune, it was already dark, and every household had lit electric lights, and the street lights illuminated the alleys brightly. The streets were bustling, and the canteen was serving dinner. One person after another was going to the canteen to eat. The primary school students had also finished school. Their faces were red and plump, the girls were wearing brightly colored new cotton-padded jackets, and they were also wearing headscarves. In the shops, customers were coming in and out, some buying oil and vinegar, some buying new year's calendars. There was laughter and chatter in front of the cloth counter, and more than a dozen young women were surrounding the shop assistant to choose fabrics. This scene of prosperity, where did it look like a poor mountain village with little land and thin soil?

A comrade in the commune office introduced the situation to me, taking a map of the commune and spreading it on the table, pointing and explaining. The forty-plus villages of Zaitangchuan were all scattered on the hillsides or valleys on both sides of the Qingshui River. Most of the land was terraced fields on the mountains. When it rained heavily, they would collapse or sink. When it was dry, they watched the clear river water flow away without being able to irrigate the crops. The farmers worked hard all year but couldn't get enough to eat. How much they wanted to control the mountains and rivers! Pointing to the map, he told me: "Zaitangchuan has changed since the day the commune was established. In just over a year, seven hydroelectric power stations, two pumping stations, and a large water-powered mill were built along the Qingshui River. Large and small canals crisscrossed, and ten were built. Those villages far from the river in the high mountains built six thermal power stations. In villages with power stations, not only is no oil used for lighting, but also grinding flour and cutting grass are all done by machine. More than half of the commune's 20,000 mu of terraced fields have undergone soil and water conservation projects to support the lips and build embankments. The barren mountains and bald ridges of Jiulongtou and Langwogou have been planted with fruit trees..." He became more and more excited, forgetting that it was already late at night. He said that the commune had a foundation and was not afraid of anything. This year, there was a severe drought that had not been seen in seventeen years, but not a single member was discouraged. In those days, they irrigated day and night with the canals built after the commune was established, and used the power of the commune's power station to pump water for irrigation. Those places that could not be irrigated were organized to weed, weeding again and again. The powerful force of the people's commune finally defeated the Heaven God, and in this barren mountain land, the harvest obtained by the whole commune was only thirteen jin less than last year.

Speaking of this, he put away the map and took out a comparison table of the members' income over the years from the cabinet. What exciting numbers! Before communization, the members here only earned more than forty yuan per person per year. In 1958, when the commune was established, it increased to sixty yuan, and in 1959 it increased to eighty yuan. Although there was a severe drought this year, the members' income was still higher than last year. He said that many people now have savings in the bank.

The next morning, I climbed the mountain to look high. First, I went to Jiulongtou. Jiulongtou is nine loess hills, where terraced fields are connected to each other, each built neatly, and the edges of the fields are built with high and thick earthen embankments with edges and corners. The earthen embankments surround the land like solid dikes, both large and small pieces of land alike. Bao Xiang, the head of the soil and water conservation station who accompanied me, had been here more than once, but when he looked at these terraced fields that looked like paintings, he couldn't restrain his excitement and emotion. He said: "With this kind of repair, the soil doesn't go down the mountain, and the water doesn't leave the ditch, and the bald hill becomes a treasure land. Without the people's commune, where would there be the power to carry out such a large-scale project!"

The sun rose high in the sky, and we crossed a mountain ridge and arrived at Langwogou. Here, it was another scene. The warm sun shone on the newly reclaimed terraced fields, and peach trees, apple trees, and oil pines were planted neatly in the terraced fields. The lower part of the trees was painted with white lime, and small wooden signs with white bottoms and red characters were inserted on the field ridges of the orchard, with the words: Guoguang Apple, Hongyu Apple, Golden Delicious Apple... The small oil pines were fresh and green. On the tender branches of apple and peach trees, the embryos of flowering and leafing had already grown, fluffy. The white smoke fertilized by the commune members with mountain firewood rose in the mountain gullies. Although it was severe winter, everything here was full of vitality.

The Party Secretary told me: "The people of Zaitangchuan, generation after generation, who doesn't want to turn the poor mountains into treasure mountains? Before liberation, not to mention, even after liberation, this major event was still difficult to do. The individual farmers looked at this boundless range of layered mountains and could only shake their heads and sigh; although mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives had managed some, the mountains were too big, and this mountain was repaired but that mountain wasn't, and the bottom of the mountain was treated but the top of the mountain wasn't, and it was still difficult to be effective. It's different with the people's commune. The commune organizes everyone, implements unified leadership, comprehensive planning, hierarchical management, adapts to local conditions, and the production teams are more and more energetic. Villages with thick soil layers have built ground ridge embankments all over the mountains, and villages with thin soil layers have built fish scale pits and contour ditches all over the slopes, each village and team showing their abilities. In this way, it will not take many years to completely change the entire Zaitangchuan." Speaking of this, the Party Secretary, who shared weal and woe with the commune members in building the mountainous area, said with deep feeling: "The iron-clad Jiangshan of the commune is becoming more and more secure, and it will lead the farmers here step by step to a happy paradise."

The sun set, and I said goodbye to the comrades of the commune and returned to the city.

The mountains disappeared into the vast night, and the car sped again on the newly built road we had come on. Looking out through the car window, it was a beautiful winter night scene in the mountainous area: electric lights like bright pearls, illuminating the hills and villages, and the roar of hydroelectric station machines and the sound of running water in the mountain channels constantly coming from both sides of the Qingshui River. In three years, only three years, our brave and hardworking people, under the guidance of the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, have created many unprecedented miracles and won so much glory for our motherland! In this way, one great three years, followed by another three years..., what will our motherland look like?

Before I had time to make more reveries, the car had already approached the city, and what greeted me was a dense and brilliant array of lights.

    岁末京西行
    柏金
    沸腾的石钢
    汽车沿着宽阔的东西长安街向西驶去。庄严巍峨的天安门从窗外闪过去了，数不尽的高大的楼房从窗外闪过去了。
    远处，像星星一样的灯火，忽明忽暗地在晨曦的薄雾中跳动，红光染红了半边天。呵！快到石景山钢铁公司了。我的心突然沸腾起来。马上就要和分手两年多的熟地方和老朋友见面了，我怎么能不激动！
    当我在厂东门下了车，看到那一座接一座红色的厂房，那一根比一根高的烟囱，听着汽笛的尖叫声和自行车急促的铃声，我却有点迷惑了。这是原来的厂东门吗？这里的那一大片庄稼地哪里去了？这比以前宽了四倍的马路是什么时候修的？那东南面一大长溜好几幢高大的新厂房是什么？那炼钢厂斜对面快要完工的又是什么厂房？我再抬头往西北方向一看，那几百公顷的地方，到处都是新房子，几乎比以前大了一倍，可是我连一个名字也说不出，只有一高炉、二高炉旁另一座粗大的高炉，我推想那就是报上介绍的三高炉了。
    炼钢厂叫一大群新的建筑物包围住了。几十层楼的塔式吊车在空中耸立着，这景象使我想起了1958年8月的情景。
    我参加了那年8月22日晚上工厂开的党委会。会上决定建立一个新的炼钢厂。会开到深夜十一点钟。开完会，我又跟着党委书记和厂长们，连夜去看了工地。第二天当我第二次到工地时，平土机已经开来了，电线网也拉起来了，运送材料和设备的汽车、马车也跟着轰轰隆隆地开过来了。工地上一时车水马龙，人声沸腾。又过了不多天再去时，这里已是烟囱矗立，钢水奔流了。他们就这样用了不到一个月的功夫就结束了石钢三十多年来有铁无钢的历史。
    离厂还有一截地，老远就看见一幅大红的标语，上面写着：“抓紧抓狠抓到底，多炼好钢迎新年”。走进车间，正碰上出钢，通红炽热的钢水正从炉口奔流出来，金色的火花溅出一丈多远。天车在头顶上来来去去装铁水运钢锭。机器的响声，送风的吼声，铁器的碰撞声，交织成一片轰鸣……。
    车间主任指着面前一座转炉说：“这是我们厂有名的先进炉——一号炉。”我看见三、四个青年小伙子，正在炉坑里一铲接一铲地清理积渣，炉膛里传出风镐连珠炮般的哒哒声，炉坑上一张标语写着：“快清炉，快修炉，快开新炉赶七炉，新年创造新成就”。原来这座转炉的工人，正在和七号炉的工人开展竞赛。走到七号转炉跟前，见几个工人挤在一起，指着炉顶不断摆动的白色火舌，在那里大声争论什么。车间主任说：“他们正在举行出钢前的“炉前判断会”呢！原来厂里准备拿这个小组作降低消耗的重点，派了一个老工人和一个技术员来帮他们作试验。这消息传到一号炉炼钢工那奎泉的耳朵里，他和大伙决定暗暗加把劲，和七号炉赛一赛。他们派人去七号炉学习，作了操作记录拿回小组研究。工厂党委知道了这件事，马上指定老工人和技术员同时帮助一号炉作试验。这两座转炉竞赛的事一传开，各转炉也都跟着参加进来了。全厂每炼一吨钢的生铁消耗由一千三百六十九公斤降低到一千二百七十七公斤。
    “众人拾柴火焰高”，车间主任用抑制不住的喜悦口吻说：“靠了大伙这种力争上游的干劲，我们的工作一天比一天有起色。今年我们的利用系数、质量和炉龄都达到了全国的先进水平。
    井下的春天
    车子离开石钢，向西走了一阵，就到了京西矿区。
    坐着罐笼，转眼功夫，下到了离地面几百米的门头沟煤矿。
    矿底下明晃晃的，几步一个日光灯，什么都看得见。这是一条巷道。有一间房宽，一层楼高，四周刷得雪白，半天也没碰见个人。记得1957年那次下井，见巷道里满是人，人们推着一吨多重的煤斗子，跑来跑去，这次怎么全没了？正想着，前面火花一闪一闪，铃声叮当乱响，来车了，这车子从外表看和有轨电车差不多，只是小一点，后面一拉溜拉着三、四十个煤斗，好半天才过完。同行的矿长介绍说，去年春天闹技术革命时，工人们用废铁板拼凑了一些车，那些车经过多次改造，一次比一次好，现在全矿差不多都使上这种新式的电机车了。有了这种车，矿底下就省出了三百八十三个推车工，他们都“转业”去采煤了。
    我又往井下走了四百多米，绕了半天，爬进一个掌子面。灯不亮，看不清掌子面到底有多大，只见一盏一盏的小灯在远处闪来闪去。煤像瀑布一样顺着四、五条电溜子哗哗哗地往下流。我爬到跟前一看，工人们很轻松地站在机器旁。一个工人指着他脚下的截煤机说：
  “这东西可真是宝贝，1957年我们没这玩意儿时，一个人忙一天，才能采三点六吨煤。1958年用上这机器，一天采七吨。今年我们又改进了一点，现在能采十一点六吨了。”他停了停，接着又说：“以前一个掌子面采一万吨煤就很不错，现在出一万八千吨，根本不算回事。现在的掌子面比以前大一倍，人却省了差不多一半。”
    不远的地方传来了隆隆的爆破声。矿长说，工人们正在开展快速掘进技术表演赛。他们用“抛渣爆破”的新方法，把岩石爆破到工作面以外，然后装岩机伸出钢铁手臂，把岩石装在煤车里运出去，这样就能使掘进更快地进行。我们边说边走，不一会就到了岩石掘进工作面。工人们正在紧张地打眼，风镐在跳动，锐利的钻头在坚硬的岩石上敲打，很快地就钻到岩石里去了。过去，每个风锤要三个人把着，现在只要一个人操作就行了。
    在升降机旁，一个年青的女工正在扳动开关，她轻轻地一扳，面前的一对两吨重的煤斗像被什么猛力推了一下似的，就自动进了罐笼。不一会就被运到井上去了。矿长说，过去四个人推车，一次得用六秒钟，还挺累呢，绞车八个钟头才能运走七百多吨煤。自从工人想法弄了个风动推车器，一次只要三秒钟，八个钟头能运一千二百多吨煤。
    回到井上，矿长又给我背了一大串数字：全局煤炭产量如果以1957年为一百，1958年就到一百七十一点二四，1959年又增长到二百六十七点一，而今年，提前一个月就完成了全年国家计划，全年的产量上升到三百四十一。矿长越背越兴奋。他说，这些数字我都背熟了，可是每念到它，心头都像烧了把火似地热烘烘的。
    离开门头沟矿，已是第二天的早晨了。我本来还想找人谈谈，但跑了几个地方，见人家都在忙，他们有的在开会总结这三年持续跃进的丰富经验；有的在开动电钻，为明年开拓新的采煤工作面；有的正在细致地检修机器；有的在紧张地制造大批的备品备件。工人们用总路线的精神，擦掉了旧的历史，创造了美好的今天，现在他们又在用总路线的精神，进行充分的准备，来迎接更辉煌更灿烂的明天。
    公社新景
    汽车沿着一条新修的公路，穿过深山峡谷，很快就到了斋堂人民公社。过去到这里来一趟可不容易！两年多前来参加公社成立大会时，还要骑毛驴，翻山岭，趟河水。现在汽车通到公社门口了。
    到公社的时候，天已黑了，家家户户都点起了电灯，路灯把一条条小巷子照得通亮通亮。街上很热闹，食堂正开晚饭，到食堂吃饭的人一个接着一个。小学生也放学了，一个个小脸又红又胖，女娃娃都穿着花花绿绿的新棉袄，还包着头巾。商店里，顾客进进出出，有的打油买醋，有的买新年的月份牌，卖布的柜台前笑语喧哗，十多个青年妇女围着售货员挑选布料。这欣欣向荣的情景，哪里像是个地少土薄的穷山沟？
    公社办公室的一位同志给我介绍情况，他拿了一张公社地图铺到桌上，一边指划一边讲。这斋堂川四十多个村庄全都分散在清水河两岸的山坡上或峡谷中，土地绝大部分是山上的梯田，一遇暴雨，就被冲得塌的塌，陷的陷，遇到旱天，眼看着清清的河水流走不能浇庄稼，农民们辛苦一年不得温饱，他们多么想治山治河啊！他指着地图告诉我：“从公社成立那天起，斋堂川就变了。仅一年多时间，沿着清水河就修起了七座水力发电站，两个扬水站，一个大水力碾，大小水渠纵横交错，修了十条，那些在高山上离河远的村庄，修起了六个火力电站。凡有电站的村庄，不但照明不用油，磨面、铡草也都用上机器了。全公社两万多亩梯田，一多半进行了扶唇垒堰的水土保持工程，荒山秃岭的九龙头和狼窝沟，栽满了果树……”他越谈越兴奋，竟忘记此刻已是深夜了。他说公社有了底子什么也不怕了。今年这里遭了十七年未有的大旱，社员们没有一个垂头丧气的。那些日子，他们白天黑夜地用公社成立后修起的水渠浇，用公社电站的电力抽水灌，浇不到灌不到的地方，就组织起来锄，锄了一遍又一遍。人民公社的强大力量终于战胜了天老爷，在这贫瘠的山地上，全社夺得的收成，仅比去年少收了十三斤。
    谈到这里，他收起地图，又从柜子里拿出一张社员历年收入比较表。这是多么令人兴奋的数字啊！公社化以前，这里的社员每年每人只收入四十多元，公社成立的1958年，就增长到了六十元，1959年又增长到八十元。今年虽然遭受严重的旱灾，社员收入仍然比去年高。他说，现在很多人在银行都有存款。
    第二天一清早，我又登山望高。先到了九龙头。九龙头是九个黄土山岗，这里梯田一块连着一块，每一块都垒得整整齐齐，地边上还修起了又高又厚有边有楞的土埂子，土埂像结实的堤堰一样围绕着土地，大块地如此，小块地也如此。陪我参观的水土保持站站长包祥同志，虽然不止一次来到这里，但当他看着这像图画一样的梯田时，仍抑制不住兴奋激动的感情，他说：“这样一修，土不下山，水不出沟，秃山岗变成宝地了。没有人民公社，哪里有力量进行这样大规模的工程！”
    太阳升到了高空，我们翻过一个山岗，到了狼窝沟，这里是另一番景象。和煦的阳光照着满山一块块新开垦的梯田，梯田里整齐地栽种着桃树、苹果和油松，树的下半部涂了白石灰，白底红字的小木牌，插满果林的田埂，上面写着：国光苹果、红玉苹果、金元帅苹果……一棵棵小油松鲜绿鲜绿。苹果、桃树柔嫩的枝条上，已经长出了开花长叶的胚胎，毛茸茸的。社员们用山柴熏肥的白烟在山沟里袅袅上升。虽是严冬天气，这里的一切都充满生机。
    党委书记告诉我：“斋堂川的人民，祖祖辈辈谁不想把穷山变宝山。解放前不用说，就是解放后，这桩大事也还是难以办到。单干农民望着这一望无边的层山叠嶂，只好叹息地摇头；互助组、农业生产合作社虽然整治了一部分，但是山太大了，这山整了那山没整，山下治了山上没治，仍难奏效。有了人民公社就不同了，公社把大伙组织起来，实行统一的领导，全面规划，分级管理，因地制宜，生产队越干越有劲，土层厚的村庄满山打起了地边埂，土层薄的村庄满坡修起了鱼鳞坑、水平沟，村村队队各显其能。这样，用不了多少年就会把整个斋堂川彻底变个样。”谈到这里，这位与社员同甘共苦建设山区的党委书记满怀深情地说：“公社这个铁打的江山越坐越牢了，它将把这里的农民一步步地引向幸福的天堂。”
    太阳西沉，我告别了公社的同志们返回城里。
    群山隐没在夜色苍茫中，汽车又急驰在来时那条新修的公路上，隔着车窗向外看，好一片山区冬夜的美景：一盏盏电灯像一颗颗明珠，照耀着山岗和村庄，清水河两岸不断传来水电站机器的轰响和山间渠道的流水声。三年，仅仅三年，我们勇敢勤劳的人民，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三面红旗的引导下，创造了多少史无前例的奇迹，给我们的祖国争得了多少光荣啊！就这样，一个伟大的三年，再接着一个三年……，我们的祖国将变成什么样子呢？
    我还没有来得及作更多的遐想，汽车已经驶近市区，迎面而来的，是一片密密麻麻的辉煌灯火。
