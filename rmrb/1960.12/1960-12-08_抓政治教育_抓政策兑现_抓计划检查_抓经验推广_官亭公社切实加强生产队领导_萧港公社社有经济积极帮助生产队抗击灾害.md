(Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 7th) Guanting Commune in Minhe County, Qinghai Province, persists in the policy of unified leadership, decentralized management, team as the foundation, and three-level ownership, promoting the development of the team-owned economy, while also strengthening the collective economy.

    Guanting Commune has eighteen production teams (basic accounting units) and one hundred and thirty-two production brigades. Since the establishment of the commune, the Party committee has focused its work on the production teams, and clarified that the commune's leadership work mainly involves helping production teams improve their management level. Over the past few years, the commune has successively sent twenty-five cadres to production teams to serve as Party branch secretaries, team leaders, and other positions. The commune Party committee also adopts methods such as working in the teams and secretaries staying in selected spots to strengthen leadership over backward teams. Each Party committee secretary identifies one or two working bases and spends most of their time working in production teams and production brigades. To facilitate leadership over remote teams, the commune has established three management areas to strengthen leadership. In leading the production teams, the commune and management areas mainly focus on grasping political education, grasping policy implementation, grasping plan inspection, and grasping experience promotion. Moreover, they have consistently regarded publicizing and implementing the Party's policies and inspecting policy implementation as the focus of all work. In order to ensure that the Party's various policies meet the masses in a timely manner, training classes have been specially held since this year, training more than one thousand production team leaders, brigade leaders, accountants, administrators, cooks, and feeders in batches and by stages. Each training class lasts three to five days, focusing on explaining policies while also conducting political and ideological education and exchanging commune construction experiences.

    In actual work, the commune cadres pay great attention to inspecting the implementation of policies. In May of this year, when weeding, Party Committee Secretary Zhang Wen-gui inspected work in the Zhaomuchuan production team and found that there were problems with the team's labor organization and work point assessment. He promptly discussed with the production team's cadres and helped each brigade rectify the labor organization while insisting on assessing work points in the fields on the same day, effectively encouraging the enthusiasm of the commune members. Based on the situation of this team, the commune Party committee launched a study and inspection throughout the commune, further improving the work point assessment system. Under the principle of implementing unified leadership, Guanting Commune clearly stipulates that the production team has the power of management, income distribution, and life arrangement, and fully respects these powers of the production team. For example, when formulating a production plan, the production team makes specific arrangements from the bottom up based on the specific situation of the team and the requirements of the commune, formulating the "three guarantees" targets for each brigade, submitting them to the production brigade to organize commune members to discuss extensively, and finally the commune makes necessary balances and adjustments. When formulating the 1960 production plan last winter, the production teams proposed that they had the conditions to grow more summer crops due to the good preparation work. After research, the commune approved the plan reported by the production team, increasing the summer field area of the entire commune from more than 27,000 mu last year to more than 54,000 mu this year.

    This commune implements the system of fixed use of labor, land, draft animals, and farm tools to production brigades, adheres to the "three guarantees and one reward" system, and earnestly implements the policy of overproduction rewards. When organizing cooperation between production brigades, it also adheres to the principle of "voluntary mutual benefit and equivalent exchange," with the unit receiving cooperation exchanging work for work and paying according to labor, vigorously mobilizing the production enthusiasm of commune members.

    Although this place suffered a relatively serious hail disaster last year, more than 1.7 million jin of grain were recovered by mobilizing commune members to use methods such as planting, sweeping, and picking, and the grain output of the entire commune still increased compared to previous years, and animal husbandry also achieved considerable development. The total income of the entire commune reached more than 1.24 million yuan, public accumulation increased compared to the previous year, and the income of 94% of the commune members also increased.

    Under the guidance of the policy of team as the foundation and three-level ownership, the farm tool repair and assembly plant, coal mine, and livestock farm directly operated by the commune have achieved corresponding development. The coal production in the first ten months of this year was more than 570 tons more than the annual output in 1959, solving the fuel problem for all the canteens in the commune; the commune's income reached more than 50,000 yuan, which powerfully supported and promoted the further development of the entire commune's production. In terms of water conservancy construction, since 1958, the commune has invested and organized the production teams to build three large main canals, expanding the water area of the entire commune from the original 23,000 mu to 34,000 mu.

(Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 7th) Xiaogang People's Commune in Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, has implemented the three-level ownership system based on production teams, and has overcome severe droughts for two consecutive years.

    This commune is an area with a large population and little arable land, of which 20,000 mu of land is often threatened by waterlogging disasters. After the establishment of the commune, on the one hand, it led the masses to reclaim more than 20,000 mu of wasteland, and at the same time, with the strength of the commune's collective economy and organizing the cooperation of the production teams, it built 150 medium-sized and small-sized water conservancy projects, basically eliminating the threat of waterlogging. In last year's fight against drought, the Doutang and Shengli management areas had difficulties with water sources due to the long anti-drought period. Just as it was a critical moment to rescue the yellow valley, the commune enterprises transferred seven water pumps and more than 30 cadres to vigorously carry out river water over the mountains to irrigate the fields, enabling the late rice of eleven production teams to harvest more than 2 million jin of grain. This year, when the field management of early rice was tight, more than 20 production teams were short of money, and the 30,000 jin of chemical fertilizer allocated by the state could not be bought back. The commune immediately took out 10,000 yuan to help these production teams buy back the chemical fertilizer, meeting the needs of timely topdressing of early rice.

    This commune also guides and supports the production teams to open up business avenues in diversified operations and sideline production based on the characteristics of many cash crops and abundant agricultural and sideline product resources. For example, in order to carry out comprehensive utilization, in addition to investing 34,000 yuan in various production teams, the commune also uses the method of directly linking commune-run factories with production teams to help production teams train technicians and guide factory (farm) construction. The entire commune's production teams have built 56 factories for comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products, and trained more than 100 technicians, which has increased a large amount of cash income for the production teams. The income from diversified operations and sideline production in many production teams can not only solve the problem of paying wages, but also provide some funds for agricultural production. This year, the commune's farm tool factory also transferred 276 iron, wood, bamboo, mud, and copper craftsmen to establish farm tool repair and assembly factories in the production teams, which greatly benefits agricultural production.

    With the strong support of the commune, the team-owned economy has developed rapidly. The development of the team-owned economy has continuously increased the commune's profit sharing. This commune has successively built eight commune-owned economic units, including farm tools, brick and tile, non-staple food processing, comprehensive farms, and tractor stations, and the income of commune-run enterprises has steadily increased year by year.

    抓政治教育　抓政策兑现　抓计划检查　抓经验推广
    官亭公社切实加强生产队领导
    萧港公社社有经济积极帮助生产队抗击灾害
    本报西宁7日电　青海省民和县官亭公社坚持统一领导、分级管理，队为基础、三级所有的政策，促进了队有经济的发展，同时社有经济也得到了壮大。
    官亭公社共有十八个生产队
  （基本核算单位），一百三十二个生产小队。公社成立以来，党委就把工作重点放在生产队，而且明确了公社的领导工作主要是帮助生产队提高经营管理水平。几年来，公社陆续下放二十五名干部到生产队担任党支部书记、队长等工作。公社党委还采取驻队办公、书记蹲点等方法，加强对后进队的领导。党委书记每人确定一至二个工作基点，以大部分时间深入生产队、生产小队工作。为了便于对边远队的领导，公社设立了三个管理区以加强领导。公社和管理区在对生产队的领导方面，主要是抓政治教育，抓政策兑现，抓计划检查，抓经验推广。而且一直把宣传、贯彻党的政策和检查政策执行情况，作为全部工作的重点。为了使党的各项政策及时与群众见面，今年以来专门举办了训练班，分期分批轮训生产队长、小队长、会计员、管理员、炊事员、饲养员等一千多人。训练班每期三、五天时间，以讲政策为主，同时进行政治思想教育和交流公社建设经验。
    公社干部在实际工作中，十分注重检查政策的执行情况。今年5月间除草时，党委书记张文珪在赵木川生产队检查工作，发现这个队的劳动组织和评工记分存在问题，就及时和生产队的干部研究，一方面帮助各小队整顿了劳动组织，并且坚持当天地头评工记分，有效地鼓舞了社员的劳动积极性。根据这个队的情况，公社党委又在全公社开展了一次学习、检查，使评工记分制度进一步健全起来。官亭公社在实行统一领导的原则下，明确规定生产队有经营管理、收益分配和安排生活等方面的权力，而且十分尊重生产队的这些权力。比如在制定生产计划的时候，生产队根据本队的具体情况和公社的要求，由下而上的进行具体安排，制定各小队的“三包”指标，交生产小队组织社员广泛讨论，最后由公社做必要的平衡和调整。在去冬制定1960年生产计划时，各生产队都提出由于备耕工作做得好，有条件多种夏种作物。公社经过研究后，就按生产队上报的计划定了案，使全社今年夏田面积由去年的二万七千多亩增加到五万四千多亩。
    这个公社实行了劳力、土地、耕畜、农具固定给生产小队使用，坚持“三包一奖”制，切实执行了超产奖励的政策。在各生产小队之间组织协作的时候也坚持了“自愿两利、等价交换”的原则，由受协作的单位以工换工，按劳付酬，有力地调动了社员的生产积极性。
    去年这里虽然遭受了比较严重的雹灾，但通过发动社员用种、扫、拾等方法，夺回粮食一百七十多万斤，全社粮食产量较往年仍有增加，畜牧业也得到了相当的发展。全社总收入达到一百二十四万多元，公共积累比上年增加，94％的社员也增加了收入。
    在队为基础、三级所有的方针指导下，公社直接经营的农具修配厂、煤矿、畜牧场获得了相应的发展。今年前十个月的产煤量比1959年年产量还多五百七十多吨，为全社所有食堂解决了燃料问题；公社收入达五万多元，这又有力地扶助和促进了全社生产的进一步发展。在水利建设方面，从1958年以来，由公社投资、组织各生产队兴修了三条大干渠，使全社水地面积由原来的二万三千亩扩大到三万四千亩。
    本报武汉7日电　湖北省孝感县萧港人民公社，贯彻执行以生产队为基础的三级所有制，连续两年战胜了严重的旱灾。
    这个公社是个人口多、耕地少的地区，其中又有两万亩地经常受到渍涝灾害的威胁。公社成立后，一面领导群众开荒两万多亩，同时以社有经济的力量和组织各生产队协作修建了一百五十处中、小型水利工程，基本上解除渍涝威胁。去年抗旱斗争中，陡岗、胜利两个管理区因抗旱时间长，最后水源发生困难，正当抢救黄谷千钧一发之际，公社企业调出了七部抽水机和三十多名干部，大搞河水翻山灌田，使十一个生产队的二万多亩晚稻多收粮食二百多万斤。今年正当早稻田间管理紧张时，有二十多个生产队缺钱，眼看国家分配的三万斤化学肥料买不回去。公社当即拿出了一万元帮助这些生产队把化肥买回来，满足了早稻及时追肥的需要。
    这个公社还根据经济作物多和农副产品资源丰富的特点，在多种经营、副业生产等方面，指导和支持生产队广开经营门路。例如，公社为大搞综合利用，除向各生产队投资三万四千元外，并利用社办工厂和生产队直接挂钩的办法，帮助生产队培养技术人员和指导建厂（场）工作，全社生产队已建起综合利用农副产品的工厂五十六个，训练出技术工人一百多人，为生产队增加了大量现金收入。不少生产队多种经营和副业收入不仅可以解决发工资的问题，还可为农业生产提供一部分资金。今年公社农具厂又下放铁、木、竹、泥、铜匠等二百七十六人，在生产队建立农具修配厂，大大的有利于农业生产。
    在公社的大力扶持下，队有经济发展很快。而队有经济的发展，又给公社的提成不断增加。这个公社已先后兴建了农具、砖瓦、副食品加工、综合农场、拖拉机站等八个社有经济单位，社办企业的收入逐年稳步增加。（附图片）
