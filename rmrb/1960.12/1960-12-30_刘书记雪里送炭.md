    Secretary Liu Provides Charcoal in the Snow
    I am a member of the Gudan Commune in Mengjin County, Henan Province. One afternoon not long ago, we received a report from the weather station saying that a cold wave would pass through our area the next day.
    Comrade Liu Hengzheng, the Party Branch Secretary of the Changdian Brigade of our commune, after hearing this news, visited every household to see if their cotton clothes were complete and if their windows were pasted properly, in order to prevent anyone from freezing. When he arrived at the home of Liu Cunzhi, a single old man, he saw that the old man had a cotton quilt, but his cotton clothes were not complete. He thought of asking the brigade to make a piece of cotton clothing for the old man. But then he thought, it would take several days for the team to make it, and the cold wave would come tomorrow, how could that be in time? He felt the new, thick, and soft cotton clothes he was wearing, and thought: I am a Communist Party member, and I should treat the difficulties of others as my own. So he gave his cotton clothes to the old man, and put on his old, patched-up cotton-padded jacket.

    刘书记雪里送炭
    我是河南孟津县谷旦公社社员。不久前的一天下午，我们接到气象台的报告，说第二天有寒流从我们这里经过。
    我们公社长店大队党支部书记刘恒政同志听到这一消息后，为了不让一个人受冻，便挨门逐户登门访问，看棉衣齐备了没有？窗户糊好了没有？他走到单身老汉刘存治家里，看见老汉的棉被有了，棉衣还没齐全，就想让大队给老人做一件。可是又一想，让队里做，总得几天才能做成，明天寒流就来，怎么来得及。他摸摸自己身上又厚又软的新棉衣，心想：我是个共产党员，应该把别人的困难当成自己的困难，于是把自己的棉衣送给老人，自己又穿上过去那件补了又补的破棉袄了。
