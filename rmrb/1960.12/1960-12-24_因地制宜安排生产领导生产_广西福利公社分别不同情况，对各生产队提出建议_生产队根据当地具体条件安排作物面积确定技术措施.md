Nanning, December 23rd (from our newspaper) The Welfare Commune in Fuzhong County, Guangxi, arranges production according to local conditions and promotes increased production measures, resulting in annual increases in grain production. In 1957, the entire commune still needed the state to centrally sell 1.1 million jin of grain, but by 1958 it had become a surplus grain commune. Fourteen of the sixteen poor teams had caught up with the rich teams. The commune's sales of pigs, poultry, oils, and other agricultural and sideline products to the state also increased.

The Welfare Commune Party Committee always paid attention to starting from the specific local conditions when arranging production: making suggestions to each production team based on different situations; allowing production teams to arrange crop areas and determine technical measures according to local conditions. This greatly mobilized the enthusiasm of grassroots cadres.

The Welfare Commune has more dry land than paddy fields. However, before 1958, the Commune Party Committee did not pay attention to starting from the specific situation. Although they focused on rice production, they rarely focused on dry land crops. Members of the Cao Cheng Brigade said: "We have three treasures here: paddy fields, dry land, and oil tea mountains. Now we only focus on one treasure (paddy fields) and have lost two treasures (dry land, oil tea mountains)." Members also reflected that it was inconvenient not to plant minor grains. The Commune Party Committee accepted the opinions of the masses, and in 1959 decided to adopt the principle of grasping both paddy fields and dry land, and planting both staple grains and miscellaneous grains, to develop grain production. This year, the area of ​​paddy fields has increased by more than 3,000 mu compared with 1957, and the area of ​​double-cropping rice has expanded by nearly 6,000 mu compared with 1957; the planting area of ​​dry land crops has reached more than 43,000 mu, and the multiple cropping index has increased by 20% compared with 1958.

When arranging production, the Commune Party Committee organized production by brigade based on the specific situation. For example, the Shuping Brigade has more paddy fields and less dry land, but the water conservancy conditions are good, and the potential for converting dry land to paddy fields is great. After the Commune Party Committee studied with the team cadres, it was decided that this production team should focus on grasping rice production. Another example is the Longyan Production Team, which has less paddy fields and more dry land. Last autumn, the Commune Party Committee and the production team party secretary, after detailed calculations, determined that this team should mainly grow dry land crops well. Due to the great emphasis on dry land, the income of Longyan Team this year has increased from more than 130,000 jin last year to more than 180,000 jin.

On the issue of changing one crop to two crops, the commune also adopted different measures by each production team according to local conditions, based on the commune's complex terrain, high altitude, low temperature, and cold mountain water. In this way, fields with good water conservancy, flat plain fields, and fields not subject to flooding, were planted with two crops of rice; high-lying fields, water-deficient fields, mountain fields, cold water fields, and riverside fields, were still planted with medium rice (japonica rice), plus one crop of dry corn or one crop of wheat; or early-maturing medium rice was planted, followed by a crop of autumn sweet potatoes. Because each team adapted well to the natural conditions when reforming the cultivation system, both water and dry land crops increased production.

The Welfare Commune Party Committee paid great attention to leading the arrangement of production by each team in accordance with labor conditions. Among the thirty-six brigades in the entire commune, twenty-four brigades had less land and more labor, with an average of two to four mu of land per laborer; twelve brigades had more land and less labor, with an average of five to ten mu per laborer. In terms of production arrangements, the commune required the former, in addition to expanding the cultivated area, to mainly vigorously develop dry land into paddy fields, one crop into two crops, increase the multiple cropping index, improve the quality of cultivation, and increase the yield per unit area according to local conditions. For the latter, in addition to requiring appropriate conversion of dry land into paddy fields and one crop into two crops, they temporarily still focused on planting medium rice, and advocated extensive planting and more harvesting. Each production team referred to these suggestions from the commune and reasonably reformed the cultivation system according to its own situation. For example, the Boliu Production Team has good water conservancy conditions and sufficient labor. This year, it not only changed more than 200 mu of fields from one crop to two crops, and converted 180 mu of dry land into paddy fields, but also rushed to plant seedlings in season, and achieved a bumper harvest. The water conservancy conditions of the Dongchi Production Team were also good. This spring, they originally planned to convert 300 mu of dry land into paddy fields, but later, when the Commune Party Committee and the team cadres studied this issue, they found that the laborers in the team had already shouldered an average of eight mu of land per person, and the season was not early at that time, so they revised the plan. In this way, both early and late rice crops and dry land crops were taken care of in a timely manner.

In the arrangement of crop varieties, the Welfare Commune adopted a realistic attitude, whether it was introducing foreign varieties or eliminating local varieties. For example, the mid-maturing medium rice variety "July Zhan" can only be planted for one season, and the yield per mu is not high, only about 300 jin, and it was considered an inferior variety. It was originally planned to be eliminated last spring. However, later, Dong Shihua, the first secretary of the Commune Party Committee, learned that the Xinhua Brigade had more than 70 mu of high loess land and riverside fields, where planting "July Zhan" avoided spring and autumn disasters (planting too early would be washed away by the spring floods; planting too late would easily be dried to death by the autumn drought). After studying this issue, the Commune Party Committee advocated planting "July Zhan" in high loess fields, and then planting a crop of sweet potatoes, buckwheat, or winter wheat. As a result, the high loess fields avoided the losses of autumn drought for two years and achieved increased production. Another example is planting late rice this year. The relevant departments of the county required the large-scale promotion of "Baihua No. 516". However, after research, the Commune Party Committee believed that the temperature in the commune was low, and the transplanting of late rice this year was also late. The "Baihua No. 516" has a long growth period, and it will not be harvested until after the Beginning of Winter. Once affected by the cold dew wind, it will reduce production, so it was not suitable for promotion and was not promoted. Due to the use of local fine varieties, although the Welfare Commune also encountered the cold dew wind this year, the late rice harvest was good, with an average yield of more than 200 jin per mu.

In leading production, the Welfare Commune implemented the principle of adapting measures to local conditions and times. Although it encountered severe disasters this year like other places, with early spring being hit by cold waves, late autumn encountering cold dew winds, and droughts in between, more than 8,000 mu of double-cropping rice still achieved a bumper harvest this year on the basis of continuous increased production for two years, and still increased production compared to last year.

    因地制宜安排生产领导生产
    广西福利公社分别不同情况，对各生产队提出建议
    生产队根据当地具体条件安排作物面积确定技术措施
    本报南宁23日电　广西富钟县福利公社因地制宜地安排生产，推行增产措施，粮食产量年年增加。1957年全社还要国家统销粮食一百一十万斤，到1958年就变成余粮社。十六个穷队已有十四个队赶上了富队。全社卖给国家的猪、家禽、油脂和其他农副产品也都增加了。
    福利公社党委在安排生产中，始终注意从当地具体情况出发：对各生产队分别不同情况提出建议；由生产队因地制宜地安排作物面积、确定技术措施。这样，大大发挥了基层干部的积极性。
    福利公社旱地面积比水田大。但在1958年以前，公社党委不注意从具体情况出发，虽然抓紧了水稻生产，但很少抓旱地作物。槽呈大队的社员就说：“我们这里是三个宝：水田、旱地、油茶山，现在只抓一个宝（水田），丢了两个宝（旱地、油茶山）。”社员还反映说，不种小杂粮，生活不方便。公社党委接受了群众的意见，1959年决定采取水田旱地一齐抓，主粮杂粮都种的方针，发展粮食生产。今年水田面积已比1957年增加三千多亩，双季稻面积比1957年扩大近六千亩；旱地作物种植面积达到四万三千多亩，复种指数比1958年增加20％。
    公社党委在安排生产时由各大队根据具体情况组织生产。如书坪大队水田多旱地少，但水利条件好，旱地改水田的潜力大。公社党委在和队干部研究后，就确定这个生产队以抓好水稻生产为主。又如龙岩生产队，水田少旱地多，去年秋天，公社党委和生产队党支书经过详细算账，确定这个队主要种好旱地作物。由于大抓旱地，龙岩队今年旱地收入已从去年的十三万多斤增加到十八万多斤。
    在一季改二季的问题上，公社根据本社地形复杂，地势较高，气温较低，山冲水冷等情况，也由各生产队因地制宜，采取不同措施。这样，水利好的田，平原大垌田，不受水淹的田，便种上两季稻；高亢田、缺水田、山冲田、冷水田、河边田等，仍种中稻（粳稻），再加种一造旱玉米或一造小麦；或者是种早熟中稻，再种一季秋红薯。由于各队改革耕作制度时很好地适应了自然条件，所以水旱作物都增产。
    福利公社党委很注意因劳力制宜领导各队安排生产。全公社三十六个大队中，田少劳力较多的有二十四个大队，平均每个劳动力负担二到四亩田地；田地多劳动力少的有十二个大队，平均每个劳动力负担五到十亩。在生产安排上，公社对前者，除要求扩大耕地面积外，主要是因地制宜地大搞旱田改水田，一季改双季，提高复种指数，提高耕作质量，提高单位产量。对后者，除要求适当进行旱田改水田，一季改两季外，暂时仍以种中稻为主，提倡广种多收。各生产队参照公社提出的这些建议，按照自己的情况合理地改革耕作制度。如波留生产队水利条件好，劳动力足，今年不仅把二百多亩田由一造改二造，把一百八十亩旱田改成水田，插秧还抢上季节，得到了大丰收。垌池生产队水利条件也不错，今年春天原准备把三百亩旱地改为水田，但后来公社党委和队干部研究这个问题时，发现队里劳动力平均每人已负担了八亩地，而且当时季节也不早了，便修改了计划。这样早晚两季稻及旱地作物都护理及时。
    福利公社在作物品种的安排上，无论是引进外来品种、或者是淘汰本地品种，都采取实事求是的态度。例如中熟种中稻“七月占”，只能种一季，亩产又不高，只有三百斤左右，被认为劣种。去年春天原准备加以淘汰。但后来，公社党委第一书记董世华了解到新华大队有七十多亩高壤田和河边田，插“七月占”，却避过了春秋灾害（插得过早，一发春水会遭水冲；插得过迟，秋后干旱又容易旱死）。公社党委研究了这个问题后，便提倡在高壤田种“七月占”，收后再种一季红薯、荞麦或冬麦。这样做的结果，高壤田两年都躲过了秋旱的损失，获得增产。又如今年种晚造，县有关部门要求大量推广“百花516号”。但公社党委经过研究，认为本社气温低，今年晚稻插秧又迟，“百花516号”生长期长，种下快到立冬才能收，一受寒露风影响就减产，不适合推广便没有推广。由于采用本地良种，福利公社今年晚造尽管也碰到寒露风，但收成较好，平均亩产达到二百多斤。
    福利公社在领导生产上，由于实行了因地因时制宜的方针，尽管同别处一样，今年碰到了严重灾害，早春遭到寒潮侵袭，晚秋又遇寒露风，中间还发生干旱，但八千多亩两季稻在接连二年增产基础上今年又获得了丰收，仍比去年增产。（附图片）
