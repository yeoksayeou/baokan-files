Xinhua News Agency, December 29th. The head of the Yemen Muslim delegation, Said Ahmed bin Muhammad Zabarra, held a farewell banquet at the Beijing Hotel tonight.

Bao Erhan, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Director of the China Islamic Association, and Vice Directors Da Pongsheng and Zhang Jie were invited to attend the banquet.

The head of the Yemen Muslim delegation, Zabarra, spoke at the banquet.

He said with reluctance, "Now we are about to leave China, but our hearts remain in China. In every city we visited, we met with our Chinese Muslim brothers and prayed with them. We saw that they have full freedom. Some Chinese Muslims work in the government, and some have become senior cadres."

Zabarra warmly praised the achievements China has made. He emphasized that the Yemeni people are loyal friends of the Chinese people. Our common goal is to oppose imperialism and build our own countries. The Yemeni people are fighting British imperialism, and we must drive British imperialism out of Aden.

Bao Erhan, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Director of the China Islamic Association, thanked Chairman Zabarra for holding this banquet in his speech. He said that the visit of the Yemen Muslim delegation to our country for more than a month has further enhanced the mutual understanding between the Chinese and Yemeni people and strengthened the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries.

Bao Erhan asked the delegation to convey the deep friendship of the Chinese people to the Yemeni people and the greetings of the ten million Chinese Muslims to their Yemeni Muslim brothers. He emphasized that the Chinese and Yemeni people will always support and help each other in the lofty cause of opposing the imperialist aggressor forces headed by US imperialism, safeguarding national independence, and building their respective countries.

At the banquet, Zabarra presented gifts from the King of Yemen to Bao Erhan and other leaders of the China Islamic Association.

Also invited to attend the banquet were people from all walks of life in the capital: Wu Defeng, Chen Weiji, He Ying, Wu Kunshan, Feng Jizhong, and others.
