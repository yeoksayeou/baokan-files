Xinhua News Agency, Minsk, December 5th: The full text of Chairman Liu Shaoqi's speech at Minsk Station today is as follows:

Dear Comrade Brezhnev! Dear Comrade Mazurov! Dear Comrade Kozlov! Dear Comrade Kiselyov! Dear Comrades and Friends!

The Chinese Party and Government Delegation has come to Minsk, the capital of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, with great pleasure. Today is also a major festival for the Soviet people—Constitution Day. We bring the fraternal greetings and warm congratulations of the entire Chinese people to the Byelorussian people and the entire Soviet people.

The Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic is a Soviet republic familiar to the Chinese people. Your heroic deeds in resisting the fascist bandits during the Great Patriotic War and the brilliant achievements in rapid recovery and reconstruction after the war have greatly inspired the Chinese people. Today's Byelorussian Republic is one of the important industrial and cultural centers of the Soviet Union.

Dear Comrades, the Chinese people warmly congratulate you and the entire Soviet people on your brilliant achievements.

The Sino-Soviet friendship is based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. The Chinese people regard consolidating this friendship as their most sacred internationalist duty. The purpose of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation's visit to the Soviet Union this time is to further consolidate and strengthen the friendship and unity between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union. China and the Soviet Union bear particularly important responsibilities for the course of world history. The great friendship and unity between our two peoples is a reliable guarantee for world peace and the victory of the cause of human progress. The imperialists' attempts to undermine this great friendship and unity by all means are futile. The peoples of China and the Soviet Union will always be the closest brothers and the most reliable comrades-in-arms.

Comrades, let us shout:

Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union!

Long live the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union headed by Comrade Khrushchev!

    刘少奇主席在明斯克车站上的致词
    中苏两国永远是最可靠的战友
    新华社明斯克5日电　刘少奇主席今天在明斯克车站上的致词，全文如下：亲爱的勃列日涅夫同志！亲爱的马祖罗夫同志！亲爱的科兹洛夫同志！亲爱的基谢廖夫同志！亲爱的同志们、朋友们！
    中国党政代表团怀着十分愉快的心情来到了白俄罗斯苏维埃社会主义共和国的首都明斯克。今天又是苏联人民的重大节日——宪法日。我们带来了全体中国人民对白俄罗斯人民和全体苏联人民的兄弟般的问候和热烈的祝贺。
    白俄罗斯苏维埃社会主义共和国是中国人民熟悉的苏联的加盟共和国。你们在伟大的卫国战争中抗击法西斯匪帮的英雄事迹和在战后迅速进行恢复和重建的光辉成就，都大大地鼓舞了中国人民。今天的白俄罗斯共和国是苏联重要的工业和文化中心之一。
    亲爱的同志们，中国人民热烈地祝贺你们的和全体苏联人民的辉煌成就。
    中苏友谊是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的基础上的。中国人民把巩固这种友谊当作自己最神圣的国际主义义务。中国党政代表团这次到苏联来访问，就是要进一步巩固和加强中苏两国人民的友谊和团结。中苏两国对于世界历史的进程负有特别重大的责任，我们两国人民伟大的友谊和团结，是世界和平和人类进步事业走向胜利的可靠保证。帝国主义者千方百计地妄想破坏这个伟大的友谊和团结是徒劳的。中苏两国人民永远是最亲密的兄弟，永远是最可靠的战友。
    同志们，让我们高呼：
    中苏两国人民永恒的、牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏联共产党中央委员会万岁！
