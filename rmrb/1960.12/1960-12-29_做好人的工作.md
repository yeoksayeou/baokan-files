    Do a Good Job of Working with People
    Zhen Wen
    People are the decisive factor in production. To fully utilize the role of people in the production process, various tasks need to be carried out, with ideological work being the most important. People's actions are guided by their thoughts; advanced thoughts lead to advanced actions. Ma Shunyou, the captain of the Second Production Team of Dujiaping, deeply understands this principle. Therefore, in arranging production and carrying out any task, he pays special attention to first doing a good job of ideological and political work. Ideological and political work is not abstract, but very concrete. Even in a small team of about one hundred people, everyone has their own personality and characteristics, and each person is different. Therefore, different ideological and political work must be carried out according to different individuals and different issues. The commendable aspect of Ma Shunyou's ideological and political work lies in this. After he clearly explained the principles based on different targets and using specific examples, persuaded and educated them, patiently helped them, found the root causes of problems, and resolved conflicts, everyone was sincerely convinced and actively engaged in labor.
    Ma Shunyou's success in working with people also lies in his ability to effectively promote the Party's mass line and consult with the masses on matters. In production, he never stood aside to direct the team members, but rather led them with exemplary actions. When encountering things he didn't fully understand, he never pretended to know what he didn't, but always "humbly asked those below," listening to the opinions of the masses. He first acted as a student and then as a teacher; he first consulted the masses and then made decisions. What was the result? When the leadership is correct, the team members do not stray. The decisions made, including the correct opinions raised by the team members, are always enthusiastically responded to by the team members. This leadership art is the best example of "from the masses, to the masses," and it is worthy of learning by every leader.
    Chairman Mao said: "Of all things in the world, people are the most precious. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle can be created." (《Selected Works of Mao Zedong》, Volume IV, p. 1516). In the past, during the revolutionary war, and now, in the cause of socialist construction, there have been countless outstanding examples. From this, it can be seen that doing a good job of working with people is extremely important. Let every leader and revolutionary cadre put doing a good job of working with people in the primary position. When the work with people is done well, outstanding achievements will surely follow.

    做好人的工作
    甄闻
    人是生产中起决定作用的因素。在生产过程中，要充分发挥人的作用，需要进行多种多样的工作，而最重要的是作好思想工作。人的行动是受思想支配的，有了先进的思想，才会有先进的行动。杜家坪第二生产小队队长马顺有深刻懂得这些道理，所以他在安排生产和进行任何一项工作中，都特别注意首先做好思想政治工作。思想政治工作不是抽象的，而是很具体的。就一个小队来说，有一百来人，但是百人百性，这个人和那个人不一样。因此，必须针对不同的对象，不同的问题，进行不同的思想政治工作。马顺有进行思想政治工作的可贵地方，就在于此。经过他根据不同对象和用具体事例讲清道理，说服教育，耐心帮助，找病根，解疙瘩以后，人人心悦诚服，个个积极劳动。
    马顺有做好人的工作，还在于他能够很好地发扬党的群众路线，遇事同群众商量的作风。在生产中，他从来不是站在一边指挥社员，而是以模范行动带动社员；遇有不完全了解的事物，他也从来不是强不知以为知，总是“不耻下问”，倾听群众的意见。先做学生，然后再做先生；先向群众请教，然后再做决定。结果怎么样呢？领导得正，社员就走不歪；决定要办的事情，包括社员中提出的正确意见，社员们总是热烈地响应。这种领导艺术，就是从群众中来到群众中去的最好范例，是值得每一个领导工作者学习的。
    毛主席说：“世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷1516页）过去，在革命战争中，现在，在社会主义建设事业中，都有无数出色的事例。由此可见，做好人的工作十分重要。让我们每一个领导工作者和革命干部，都把做好人的工作放在首要地位，人的工作做好了，出色的成绩必将接踵而至。
