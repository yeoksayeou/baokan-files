    According to reports: The Land System Reform Committee of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has distributed 200,000 land certificates to various parts of Tibet and requested that people's governments at all levels in various regions distribute the land certificates to the emancipated farmers as soon as possible and in a grand manner. The upper part of the land certificate, between the five-star red flags, has a portrait of Chairman Mao with a gold border...

    Lhasa River, oh, Lhasa River!
    In the past, your suffering was great,
    Slaves were cattle and horses year after year,
    Without clothing or food, tears formed a river.
    Lhasa River, oh, Lhasa River!
    Now your joy is great,
    Serfs have turned over and gained liberation,
    Breaking the shackles of a thousand years.
    Lhasa River, oh, Lhasa River!
    Golden light shimmers on the golden waves,
    Beating gongs and drums in celebration,
    Distributing land to plant highland barley.
    Lhasa River, oh, Lhasa River!
    Singing songs of a bountiful harvest and happiness,
    Singing praises of our benefactor, Chairman Mao,
    His kindness is like the sea, etched in our hearts.

    拉萨河上欢乐多
    杨光
    据报载：西藏自治区筹备委员会土地制度改革委员会已将二十万张土地证发往西藏各地，并要求各地各级人民政府尽快地、隆重地将土地证发到翻身的农民手里。土地证的上部，在五星国旗之间，有印着金色边框的毛主席像……
    拉萨河呵，拉萨河！
    从前你的苦难多，
    奴隶年年当牛马，
    无衣无食泪成河。
    拉萨河呵，拉萨河！
    如今你的欢乐多，
    农奴翻身得解放，
    打断千年铁枷锁。
    拉萨河呵，拉萨河！
    金光闪闪泛金波，
    敲锣打鼓齐庆贺，
    分来土地种青稞。
    拉萨河呵，拉萨河！
    欢唱丰收幸福歌，
    欢唱恩人毛主席，
    恩情似海记心窝。
