The Chinese people firmly support the Japanese people's struggle. We firmly believe that in the current excellent situation where the people's strength clearly outweighs the reactionary forces and the peace forces clearly outweigh the war forces, the Japanese people's persistent and heroic struggle will surely continue to achieve new and greater victories.
