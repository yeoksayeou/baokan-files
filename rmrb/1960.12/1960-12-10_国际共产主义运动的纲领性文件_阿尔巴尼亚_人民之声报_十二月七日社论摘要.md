Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, December 8th - The Albanian newspaper *People's Voice* published an editorial on December 7th entitled "Programmatic Document of the International Communist Movement," regarding the declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties. The editorial stated, "This declaration is the Marxist-Leninist programmatic document of the international communist movement. In this document, the principled positions and tasks of all national communist and workers' parties in the further struggle for peace, national independence, democracy, and socialism are defined on the most important questions."

The editorial said, "This declaration is the foundation for the unity and solidarity of all national communist and workers' parties."

The editorial stated, "The Albanian Labor Party completely agrees with the declaration issued, because the declaration embodies Marxist-Leninist doctrine and reflects the correct and consistent line of the Albanian Labor Party in its entirety. The unanimous adoption of this declaration by representatives of communist and workers' parties from around the world is a great victory and important achievement for the entire international communist and workers' movement. It demonstrates the unbreakable unity of the communist movement, the solidarity of the powerful socialist camp, and deals a heavy blow to the imperialists and their lackeys, the modern revisionists."

The editorial said that the declaration answers all the major contemporary questions of concern to humanity from a Marxist-Leninist standpoint.

The editorial said that the elucidation of the definition of the era in the declaration "has significant principled meaning, because the determination of the tactics and strategies of the international communist movement and the workers' parties of each individual country also depends on this correct Marxist-Leninist definition of our era."

The editorial said that today, the balance of world forces has shifted in favor of socialism and against capitalism. The strength of socialism is increasing, its influence on the development of international affairs is increasing, and it is becoming increasingly decisive. The great development of the glorious Soviet Union, which has already taken the world's lead in many respects, especially in science and technology, confirms this. The great achievements of the People's Republic of China and other socialist countries, whose position in all aspects of human activity is rapidly improving, also confirm this. The people of all countries are more resolutely engaged in the anti-imperialist, anti-colonial struggle. The great achievements made by communist and workers' parties on all continents in the class struggle against capitalism confirm from another aspect that the position of socialism, peace, and democracy is strengthening, while the position of reactionary forces and imperialism is weakening.

The editorial continued, saying that this reality makes it possible to draw important conclusions on issues of vital importance to mankind, such as the issue of war and peace and the issue of anti-imperialist struggle.

The editorial said, "The declaration emphasizes that, despite the changes in the balance of power, the aggressive nature of imperialism has not changed. 'U.S. imperialism is the main stronghold of world reactionary forces, the international gendarme, and the enemy of the people of the whole world.' 'Imperialism poses a serious danger to all mankind,' and 'as long as imperialism exists, there will be soil for wars of aggression.' The declaration points out that only 'the victory of socialism throughout the world will ultimately eliminate the social and national causes that give rise to any war.'" The editorial said, "Life has most clearly proved the correctness of the above ideas. Therefore, the declaration very correctly calls on the people of all countries to be vigilant against any attempt by the imperialists to provoke war, the imperialists who want to plunge mankind into a new world disaster more terrible than the past two world wars."

The editorial said, "However, the declaration correctly emphasizes that war is not destined to be inevitable. Today, there are real forces that can destroy the imperialists' aggressive plans. Today, these forces are strong and are growing stronger. This is a correct and mobilizing argument, because it also points out the path to achieving this lofty goal desired by the people of all countries. This once again shows the people of all countries that communists not only have a desire for peace, but are also the most determined and active fighters for the defense of peace. The further unity and consolidation of the socialist system, the strengthening of the defense forces of socialist countries, the joint struggle of the socialist camp, the international working class, the national liberation movement, and all peace-loving forces play a major decisive role in defending peace and stopping war. Communists are fully convinced that, due to the concerted action of these forces, world war can be avoided."

The editorial said, "The socialist countries have always unswervingly followed a policy of peace. The declaration points out that the policy of peaceful coexistence is the basis of the foreign policy of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. This principle formulated by the great Lenin is the only correct and reasonable principle in the relations between countries with different systems. Our party and government will, as always, unswervingly implement this principle. The policy of peaceful coexistence is in the interests of all countries that oppose war and demand lasting peace. The declaration correctly emphasizes that peaceful coexistence between countries is not, as the revisionists say, a renunciation of the class struggle, nor is it a cancellation of the ideological and political struggle against imperialism, or a reconciliation of socialist ideology with bourgeois ideology."

The editorial then spoke about the danger of a new world war, as emphasized in the declaration, saying, "For this, it is necessary to have a high degree of vigilance and to constantly expose the aggressive policies of imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism. We must carefully watch the conspiracies of the warmongers and mobilize the masses." The editorial said, "This declaration is an important combat program for communists and the people of all countries in the struggle against warmongers, exposing imperialists, especially U.S. imperialists, defending peace, and avoiding a new world war."

The editorial pointed out, "The socialist countries, united in the powerful socialist camp, have become a huge international force with a powerful influence on the development of the whole world. The people of all countries are looking to the socialist countries, the glorious Soviet Union, the People's China, and the entire people of the people's democratic countries. The strength of the socialist camp lies in its iron unity." The editorial said, "The Soviet Union, the first country to open up the brilliant road of socialism and which is currently victoriously building communism, plays a leading role in the socialist camp. The Soviet Union is the most powerful country in the socialist countries, the most advanced country, the country that has accumulated very valuable experience in all aspects, and the country that helps all other fraternal peoples with an internationalist spirit to build a new socialist society as soon as possible."

The editorial emphasized that the declaration paid special attention to the issues of the national liberation struggle of colonial peoples and the struggles and tasks of communist and workers' parties in capitalist countries. The declaration put forward a series of important arguments on the following issues: the inevitable and complete collapse of colonialism, the task of national rejuvenation of countries that have shaken off the colonial yoke, the role of the national bourgeoisie, independent national democratic states, etc. The editorial said, "These arguments will greatly benefit the struggle of communists and the people of colonial countries for freedom and independence."

The editorial said, "The arguments concerning strengthening the unity of the workers' movement, cooperation with social democratic workers, the struggle against capitalist monopoly groups, the struggle for national independence against U.S. imperialist economic, political, and armed intervention, the path to socialism, etc., are equally important for the activities of communist and workers' parties in capitalist countries and for the formulation of their tactics and strategies."

The editorial said, "Modern revisionism, as a theoretical and practical reflection of bourgeois ideology, as also emphasized in the 1957 declaration, remains the main danger to the international communist and workers' movement. Revisionists, especially Yugoslav revisionists, support imperialist reactionaries against communist and workers' parties and against the unity between communist and workers' parties and socialist countries. Therefore, the struggle against revisionists is a necessary task."

The editorial said, "The declaration defines the true face of the Yugoslav revisionists as traitors to Marxism-Leninism, condemning their activities of paralyzing the revolutionary struggle of the working class, undermining the socialist camp and the international communism movement, and endangering the unity of all peace-loving forces and countries."

The editorial said, "The Albanian Labor Party, thoroughly loyal to the 1957 Moscow Declaration, has waged a firm principled struggle against Yugoslav revisionism. Our party sees it as a necessary task for itself to consolidate the unity of the socialist camp and the international communist and workers' movement. It will continue this struggle in the future."

The editorial said that the struggle against dogmatism and sectarianism is also an important task of communist and workers' parties, because if they are not fought persistently, they may become the main danger in a particular party at one or another stage of development.

The editorial pointed out, "At a time when the imperialist bourgeoisie and all reactionaries in the world are gathering their forces to oppose communism, it is particularly necessary to strengthen the unity of the international communist movement." The editorial said that the basis of the unity of the international communist movement is the invincible doctrine of Marxism-Leninism and the principle of proletarian internationalism. Communist and workers' parties in all countries protect their unity as they protect their most precious possessions.

The editorial said, "All parties are independent and equal in the communist movement. They support each other and solve problems through meetings and consultations. They jointly determine their views on issues of common interest. The guarantee of the unity of the international communist movement and the guarantee of the unity of will and action of Marxist-Leninist parties lie in the observance of these principles." The editorial said, "Our party is loyal to Marxism-Leninism and to the principles on which relations between communist parties and socialist countries are based. In the future, it will protect and strengthen the unity of the international communist movement and the socialist camp, as it protects its most precious possessions."

The editorial said, "It is well known that the vanguard of the international communist movement was and remains the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union—the party founded by the great Lenin, the most experienced and long-tempered party in the struggle for the cause of socialism and communism. The experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a valuable asset of the entire communist movement. It is also a huge asset to our Labor Party. Our party has consistently and will always learn from the great Bolshevik Party's outstanding experience."

The editorial said, "The current task is to implement the declaration in practice. In the struggle to implement the declaration, communist and workers' parties in all countries will further strengthen their unbreakable unity and achieve new successes in the struggle for peace, national independence, democracy, and socialism."

The editorial concluded, "Just as the Albanian Labor Party implemented the 1957 Moscow Declaration in the past, it will continue to faithfully implement the declaration of the November 1960 meeting in the future. The guarantee of this is our party's loyalty to Marxism-Leninism."

    国际共产主义运动的纲领性文件
    阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”十二月七日社论摘要
    新华社地拉那8日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》7日以《国际共产主义运动的纲领性文件》为题，就各国共产党和工人党代表会议声明发表社论。社论说，“这个声明是国际共产主义运动的马克思列宁主义的纲领性文件，在这个文件里，确定了所有国家共产党和工人党在进一步争取和平、民族独立、民主和社会主义的斗争中最重要问题上的原则立场和任务。”
    社论说，这个声明“是所有国家共产党和工人党团结一致的基础。”
    社论说，“阿尔巴尼亚劳动党完全同意所发表的声明，因为在这个声明中体现了马克思列宁主义学说，反映了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党正确的始终一贯的全部路线。世界各国共产党和工人党的代表一致通过这个声明是整个国际共产主义和工人运动的一个巨大胜利和重要成就。它表明了共产主义运动的牢不可破的团结，表明了强大的社会主义阵营的团结，对帝国主义者和他们的仆从现代修正主义者是个沉重的打击。”
    社论说，这个声明从马克思列宁主义的立场出发，对人类所关切的当代一切主要问题给予了回答。
    社论说，声明中关于时代定义的阐述“有着重大的原则意义，因为国际共产主义运动和每个个别国家的工人阶级的政党的策略和战略的确定也都取决于对我们时代的这个马克思列宁主义的正确定义。”
    社论说，今天，世界力量的对比已经发生了有利于社会主义而不利于资本主义的变化。社会主义力量日益加强，它对国际事态发展的影响日益增加，并且日益具有决定性意义。在很多方面，特别是在科学技术方面已经占世界首位的光荣的苏联的巨大发展证实了这一点。在人类活动的各个方面所占的地位正在迅速提高的中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家的巨大成就也都证实了这一点。各国人民更加坚决地投入反帝、反殖民主义的斗争，共产党和工人党在世界各大洲反对资本主义的阶级斗争中所取得的巨大成就，从另一方面证实了社会主义、和平和民主的阵地正在加强，而反动势力和帝国主义的阵地正在削弱。
    社论接着说，这种现实使得可以在战争与和平问题、反帝斗争问题等这类对人类切身有关的问题上得出重要的结论。
    社论说，“声明中强调指出，尽管力量对比已经有了改变，然而帝国主义的侵略本性并没有改变，‘美国帝国主义是世界反动势力的主要堡垒，是国际宪兵，是全世界人民的敌人’，‘帝国主义给全人类带来严重的危险’，并且‘只要帝国主义还存在，就有侵略战争的土壤’。声明指出，只有‘社会主义在全世界的胜利，将最终消除产生任何战争的社会原因和民族原因’。”社论说，“生活最清楚地证明了上述思想的正确性。因此，声明十分正确地向各国人民呼吁要警惕帝国主义者挑起战争的任何企图，帝国主义者想把人类投入一次比过去的两次世界大战都更加恐怖的新的世界灾难。”
    社论说，“但是，声明正确地强调指出，战争不是注定不可避免的。今天已经有了能够摧毁帝国主义侵略计划的现实力量。今天，这些力量是强大的，并且还正在日益壮大。这是一个正确的具有动员力量的论点，因为它还指出了达到一切国家人民所希望的这一崇高目的的途径。这再一次向一切国家人民表明了共产党人不仅具有和平的愿望，并且是保卫和平的最坚决和最积极的战士。社会主义体系的进一步团结和巩固，社会主义国家防御力量的加强，社会主义阵营、国际工人阶级、民族解放运动和一切爱好和平的力量的斗争的联合，对保卫和平、制止战争起着主要的决定性作用。共产党人完全相信，由于这些力量的一致行动，世界战争是可以避免的。”
    社论说，“社会主义各国始终不渝地遵循着和平政策。声明指出，和平共处政策是苏联和其他社会主义国家对外政策的基础。伟大列宁所制定的这个原则是不同制度国家关系中的唯一正确合理的原则，我国党和政府将像以往那样始终不渝地执行这一原则。和平共处政策符合反对战争、要求持久和平的所有各国人民的利益。声明正确地强调指出，各国间的和平共处并不是像修正主义者所说的那样放弃阶级斗争，也不是取消对帝国主义的思想斗争和政治斗争，以及社会主义意识形态同资产阶级意识形态的调和。”
    社论接着就声明中所强调的在目前就要进行反对新世界大战的危险时说，“为此，必须具有高度的警惕性，不断揭露帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义的侵略政策。必须细心地注视着战争挑拨者的阴谋诡计，必须动员群众。”社论说，“这次发表的声明是共产党人和各国人民在反对战争挑拨者，揭露帝国主义者，首先是美帝国主义者，保卫和平和避免新世界大战的斗争中的重要的战斗纲领。”
    社论指出，“团结在强大的社会主义阵营中的社会主义国家已经成为对整个世界发展具有强有力的影响的巨大的国际力量。一切国家的人民都瞩望着社会主义国家、光荣的苏联、人民中国和人民民主国家的全体人民。社会主义阵营的力量就在于它钢铁般的团结。”社论说，“第一个开辟了光辉的社会主义道路、并且目前正胜利地建设着共产主义的国家——苏联在社会主义阵营中起着主要作用，苏联是社会主义各国中最强大的国家，是最先进的国家，是在各方面都积累了十分宝贵的经验的国家，是以国际主义精神帮助其他所有兄弟人民尽早地建成社会主义新社会的国家。”
    社论着重指出，声明特别注意有关殖民地人民民族解放斗争和资本主义各国共产党工人党的斗争和任务的问题。声明就以下问题提出了一系列的重要论点：殖民主义必然彻底崩溃，挣脱了殖民枷锁的各国的民族复兴的任务，民族资产阶级的作用，民族民主的独立国家等等。社论说，“这些论点将大大有利于殖民地国家共产党人和人民争取自由独立的斗争。”
    社论说，“关于加强工人运动的统一，关于同社会民主党工人的合作，关于反对资本垄断集团的斗争，关于争取民族独立反对美帝国主义经济、政治、武装干涉的斗争，关于走向社会主义的道路等等的论点，对于资本主义各国共产党工人党的活动，对于他们策略战略的制订，同样具有特殊的意义。”
    社论说，“作为资产阶级意识形态在理论上和实际上的反映的现代修正主义，正如1957年的宣言也强调指出的，仍然是国际共产主义运动和工人运动的主要危险。修正主义者，首先是南斯拉夫修正主义者支持帝国主义反动派反对共产党工人党，反对共产党工人党以及社会主义国家之间的团结。因此，反对修正主义者的斗争是个必需的任务。”
    社论说，“声明确定了南斯拉夫修正主义者作为马克思列宁主义叛徒的真面目，谴责他们瘫痪工人阶级革命斗争、破坏社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动以及危害一切爱好和平的力量和国家的团结的活动。”
    社论说，“彻底忠诚于1957年莫斯科宣言的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党对南斯拉夫修正主义作了坚决的原则性斗争。我们党把它看作是自己巩固社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动工人运动的团结的必要任务。她在今后仍将继续这一斗争。”
    社论说，反对教条主义和宗派主义的斗争也是共产党工人党的重要任务，因为如果不对它们作坚持不懈的斗争，也可能成为个别党在这一或那一发展阶段上的主要危险。
    社论指出，“在帝国主义资产阶级和世界所有反动派纠集自己的力量来反对共产主义的时候，就特别需要加强国际共产主义运动的团结。”社论说，国际共产主义运动团结的基础是战无不胜的马克思列宁主义学说，是无产阶级国际主义的原则。各国共产党和工人党像保护最珍贵的东西一样保护他们的团结。
    社论说，“所有党在共产主义运动中是独立和平等的，它们互相支持，通过会晤和协商来解决问题，他们一起确定对有关共同利益的问题的观点。国际共产主义运动团结一致的保证，马克思列宁主义政党意志和行动统一的保证就在于遵守这些原则。”社论说，“我们党忠于马克思列宁主义，忠于各国共产党和社会主义国家间关系所依据的原则，今后也将像保护最珍贵的东西一样，保护并加强国际共产主义运动和社会主义阵营的团结一致。”
    社论说，“人所共知的国际共产主义运动的先锋队过去是，今后仍然是光荣的苏联共产党——伟大列宁创建的党，在为社会主义和共产主义事业斗争中经验最丰富和久经锻炼的党。苏联共产党的经验是整个共产主义运动的宝贵财富，它对我们劳动党也是一个巨大的财富，我们党一贯地并将永远地学习伟大的布尔什维克党的卓越经验。”
    社论说，“现在的任务是在实践中贯彻声明。在为贯彻声明而进行的斗争中，各国共产党和工人党将进一步加强他们牢不可破的团结，将在争取和平、民族独立、民主和社会主义的斗争中取得新的成就。”
    社论最后说，“阿尔巴尼亚劳动党如同过去贯彻1957年莫斯科会议宣言一样，今后仍将忠实地贯彻1960年11月会议的声明。这一点的保证就是我们党对马克思列宁主义的忠诚。”
