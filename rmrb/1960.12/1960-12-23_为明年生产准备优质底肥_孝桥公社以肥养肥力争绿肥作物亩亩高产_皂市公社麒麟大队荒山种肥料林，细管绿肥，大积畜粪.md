    To Prepare High-Quality Base Fertilizer for Next Year’s Production
    Xiaqiao Commune Strives for High Yields of Green Manure Crops by Using Fertilizer to Nourish Fertilizer
    Zao City Commune’s Qilin Brigade Plants Fertilizer Forests on Barren Hills, Carefully Manages Green Manure, and Vigorously Accumulates Livestock Manure

    (Our report) The Xiaqiao Commune in Linchuan County, Jiangxi, conscientiously implements the Party's various policies, relies on the masses to summarize experience in managing green manure, and makes green manure management work more and more meticulous. More than 18,600 mu of green manure crops in the entire commune are generally growing well, with first-class seedlings reaching 75%. Cadres and the masses throughout the commune are continuing to manage first-class seedlings, while strengthening field management of 20% of second-class seedlings and 5% of third-class seedlings, striving to improve first-class seedlings, and to have second and third-class seedlings catch up to first-class seedlings.

    The Xiaqiao Commune is an area with self-flowing irrigation. To achieve high yields of green manure, the key issue at present lies in careful management of green manure and doing a good job in ditching and drainage, especially in doing a good job of topdressing to nourish fertilizer. In order to ensure that green manure has sufficient topdressing, under the leadership of the commune party committee, the party organizations of each brigade separately led each team to conscientiously implement fixed quotas for manure accumulation, and to purchase household fertilizer from commune members at a price determined by quality in cash. This promoted a shock manure accumulation campaign throughout the commune, focusing on environmental sanitation, scraping sod, burning fire soil ash, and digging pond mud, and prepared a large amount of high-quality topdressing for green manure in advance.

    In order to strengthen green manure field management, this commune, on the basis of implementing the "Three Guarantees," and according to natural conditions, proximity of residence, and convenience of management, divided 272 professional groups, specially responsible for managing green manure, and designated the team leader to take specific leadership. Most of the professional group members are elderly farmers and activists with a strong sense of responsibility and experience in cultivating green manure. Labor quotas were implemented for each person, with responsibility signs posted on each plot, stipulating the scope of responsibilities, including preventing water damage, applying fertilizer in stages, preventing pests and diseases, and preventing trampling by pedestrians and livestock, and established reward and punishment systems, striving to achieve early, meticulous, and good management. The effect of doing this is very good. In Raofang Team of Hongguang Brigade, after implementing the fixed quota responsibility system, more than 100 mu of green manure completed the ditching and drainage work one week earlier than last year, and universally applied fertilizer once. The teams of Zhongzhou Brigade also had similar situations.

    In order to further manage green manure well, the commune, brigade, and team levels again mobilized the masses to summarize experiences in managing green manure. The commune established a scientific research committee, and the brigade established a scientific research group, led by the party committee secretary, and absorbing cadres, veteran farmers, and pacesetters to participate, leading the teams to carry out activities to study and manage green manure well. The scientific research group of Xinzhong Brigade, based on past experience, conducted management experiments in a 1.2 mu green manure field in Beiyuandang, using 32 jin of lime, 2 dan of rice husk ash, and 1 dan of straw ash as topdressing. The results of the experiment were very good. The brigade party branch immediately summarized and promoted it throughout the team. During the promotion, it was discovered that the effect was not significant for the Hudong and Huxi production teams, and some fields even had no effect. The brigade party branch led the scientific research group to further study and found that the effect was not significant because they did not choose rainy days when applying lime and other fertilizers. The entire commune's green manure management work, through trial promotion, immediately solved problems when they were discovered, so it became more and more meticulous, and more than 18,000 mu of green manure were generally managed earlier, more meticulously, and better than last year. For example, ditching and drainage were not only done in advance, but also achieved broken and leveled soil clods, interconnected ditches, and dry fields after rain stopped. In terms of topdressing, they also looked at the fields, seedlings, and weather, and most of it was concentrated fertilizer.

    Currently, the Xiaqiao Commune Party Committee is organizing cadres to conduct a major inspection of green manure field management to further promote the commune's green manure field management work.

    (Our report) In the current winter manure accumulation campaign, the Qilin Brigade of Zao City Commune in Shimen, Hunan, put forward the slogan of "three nurturing fields," that is, after the "Three Guarantees" are implemented, mobilize the work teams to effectively use mountains to nurture fields, use fields to nurture fields, and use livestock to nurture fields, and strive to accumulate sufficient high-quality base fertilizer for the brigade's more than 2,400 mu of farmland this winter and spring.

    According to the brigade's manure accumulation plan and existing fertilizer sources, in terms of using mountains to nurture fields, they arranged the more than 1,400 mu of barren mountain forests in the following three ways: 300 mu of barren land near the fields, facing the sun, and suitable for planting fertilizer forests, were allocated to the work teams with fixed professional labor to cultivate six wild fertilizer species such as wild cedar trees, broadleaf wormwood, trumpet stalks, and horse mulberry trees. These wild fertilizer species grow quickly and have many branches and leaves. If they are planted this year, more than 24,000 dan of wormwood leaves can be collected by the time of Guyu next year; 120 mu of open space at the foot of tung oil and tea oil forests will implement a combination of forestry and fertilizer, and some green manure will be sown during the reclamation period this winter; the remaining nearly 1,000 mu of jiao zha (underbrush) mountains will uniformly set the time for three harvests of wormwood per year (spring, summer, and autumn) and two seasons of zha (green zha in July, and thorny zha in winter), which not only eliminates mountain fires and damage, but also achieves cutting and storage, and can produce 90,000 dan of thorny zha every year, ensuring the supply of raw materials for each work team to burn fire soil ash.

    In terms of using fields to nurture fields, the main focus is on expanding planting and cultivating green manure well. Now, the average mu of farmland has more than half a mu of green manure. Secondly, more than 450 field-side fertilizer pits have been built, so that they can be cut and processed on the spot. All 133 mu of idle farmland in the brigade have been soaked in winter water, and 35 dan of winter wormwood have been trampled into each mu.

    In terms of using livestock to nurture fields, the work teams of the brigade, according to their actual conditions, adopted six methods: breeding, building, fumigating, bedding, inspecting, and collecting. The brigade currently has more than 1,130 head of livestock, with one head of livestock for every two mu of farmland. The brigade's farmland is distributed in three bays, two ridges, and one valley. Without moving the original large and small livestock farms, each work team adopted the method of filling gaps and supplementing deficiencies, building 17 new livestock pens, and moving livestock to the fields. Each livestock farm has a dedicated person to raise livestock and accumulate fertilizer, and is also responsible for fumigating soil and bedding the pens, and a system of inspection and evaluation has been established. Commune members' household fertilizer and canteen fertilizer are also collected and managed by dedicated personnel on a regular basis, and remuneration is paid according to quality.

    In the continuous development of the winter manure accumulation campaign, in order to ensure the realization of "three nurturing fields," in addition to fixing 144 laborers to specialize in cultivating fertilizer forests and green manure, fumigating and burning fire soil, and processing pit fertilizer, general commune members also combine the collection of weeds and miscellaneous zha to fumigate soil and burn ash. 197 feeders, cooks, and nursery workers also combine their own work to accumulate and create fertilizer. As of recently, excluding green manure and fertilizer forests, the entire team has accumulated more than 200,000 dan of various fertilizers.

    为明年生产准备优质底肥
    孝桥公社以肥养肥力争绿肥作物亩亩高产
    皂市公社麒麟大队荒山种肥料林，细管绿肥，大积畜粪
    本报讯 江西临川县孝桥公社认真贯彻执行党的各项政策，依靠群众总结管好绿肥经验，绿肥管理工作越做越细。全社一万八千六百多亩绿肥作物，普遍生长良好，一类苗达75％。全社干部和群众，正在继续管好一类苗的同时，加强20％的二类苗、5％的三类苗的田间管理，要一类苗锦上添花，二、三类苗赶上一类苗。
    孝桥公社是灌溉自流化的地区，要实现绿肥高产，就当前来说，关键问题在于细管绿肥，做好开沟排水工作，特别是做好以肥养肥的追肥工作。为保证绿肥有足够的追肥，在公社党委的领导下，各大队党组织分别领导各小队，认真实行了积肥有定额，社员积家肥按质论价现金收买。这样就推动全社范围内的大搞环境卫生、铲草皮、烧火土灰、挖塘泥的突击积肥运动，提前为绿肥准备好了大量的优质追肥。
    为了加强绿肥田间管理，这个社又在贯彻执行“三包”的基础上，根据自然条件、居住远近和管理方便等原则，划分了二百七十二个专业组，专责管理绿肥，并指定由小队长具体领导。专业组人员，大部分是责任心强、有培育绿肥经验的老年农民和积极分子。每人都实行了劳动定额，逐丘插责任牌子，规定了防止水渍、分期追肥、防治病虫害、防止行人和牲畜践踏等责任范围，并制订奖惩制度，力争做到管早、管细、管好。这样做的效果很好，红光大队饶坊小队，在实行定额责任管理制度后，一百多亩绿肥，比去年提前一个星期做好了开沟排水工作，并普遍追施了一次肥料。中洲大队的各小队也有类似的情况。
    为了进一步管好绿肥，公社、大队、小队又层层发动群众，总结管好绿肥经验。公社成立了科学研究委员会，大队成立了科学研究小组，由党委书记负责，吸收干部、老农、标兵参加，领导各小队展开研究管好绿肥的活动。新中大队的科学研究小组，根据以往经验，在背园塘的一丘一亩二分的绿肥田中进行管理试验，用三十二斤石灰、两担谷壳灰和一担秆灰作追肥。试验的结果效果很好。大队党支部立即总结并在全队重点推广。推广中又发现了湖东、湖西两个生产小队的效果不大，有的田甚至没有效果。大队党支部领导科学研究小组的人员，进一步作了研究，发现是由于追施石灰等肥料时没有选择阴雨天，所以效果不大。全社绿肥管理工作通过试验推广，发现问题立即解决，因此越做越细，一万八千多亩绿肥，普遍比去年管得早、管得细、管得好。如开沟排水，不仅做到了提前，而且做到了土块打碎打平、沟沟相通、雨住田干。追肥方面，也做到了看田、看苗、看天，而且大部分是精肥。
    目前，孝桥公社党委会正组织干部开展绿肥田间管理大检查，进一步促进全社的绿肥田间管理工作。
    本报讯  湖南石门皂市公社麒麟大队在今冬积肥运动中，提出了“三养田”的口号，即在“三包”落实后，发动作业组切实作到以山养田，以田养田，以畜养田，力争今冬明春为全队二千四百多亩田地积足优质底肥。
    按照这个大队的积肥规划和现有肥源，在以山养田方面，他们把一千四百多亩荒山丛林进行了这样三种安排：三百亩近田、向阳、适宜种植肥料林的荒地，由所在作业组固定专业劳力，垦植野椿树、大叶蒿、号筒杆、马桑树等六个野生肥种。这些野肥种生长快，枝叶多，今年下种，明年谷雨边即可采集二万四千多担蒿叶；一百二十亩油桐油茶林脚的空隙地，实行林肥结合，在今冬垦复时期，播下一些绿肥；其余近一千亩脚楂山，统一定出一年三次蒿（春、夏、秋三季），两季楂（7月青楂、冬季茨楂）的采割时间，既杜绝了山火和破坏，又做到了有割有蓄，每年能生产茨楂九万多担，保证了各作业组烧制火土灰原料的供应。
    在以田养田方面，主要是扩种和培育好绿肥。现在平均每亩田地已有绿肥半亩以上。其次修建了田头肥氹四百五十多个，做到了就地铲割，就地沤制。全队有一百三十三亩休闲田，全部泡上了冬水，每亩踩足了三十五担冬蒿。
    在以畜养田方面，这个大队的各作业组，根据本组的实际情况，分别采取了繁、建、熏、垫、检、收等六字办法。全队现有牲畜一千一百三十多头，每两亩田地有一头牲畜。全队田地分布在三湾两岗一峪，各作业组在不搬动原有大小畜场的前提下，采取填空补缺的办法，新建畜栏十七处，移畜就田。每处畜场都有专人养畜积肥，兼负熏土垫栏的任务，并订有检查评比的制度。社员家肥和食堂肥料也同样有专人按期收集和管理，按质付给报酬。
    在冬季积肥运动持续开展中，各作业组为保证“三养田”的实现，除固定了一百四十四个劳力专门培种肥料林和绿肥，熏烧火土，沤制氹肥外，一般社员还结合收集杂草、杂楂熏土烧灰。一百九十七名饲养员、炊事员、保育员也结合本身工作积肥造肥。全队到最近止，不算绿肥、肥林，已积各种肥料二十多万担。
