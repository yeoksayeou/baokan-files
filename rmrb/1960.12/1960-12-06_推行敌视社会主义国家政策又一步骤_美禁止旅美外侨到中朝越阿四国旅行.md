    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, December 2nd: The U.S. State Department announced on December 1st that it is forbidding foreign residents living in the United States from traveling to China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and Albania, or passing through these countries during travel. This is another step taken by the U.S. government in persisting in its policy of hostility towards socialist countries.
    The U.S. government has previously issued orders prohibiting U.S. citizens from traveling to the aforementioned countries. The State Department's new regulations actually expand the scope of this order to include foreign residents living in the U.S. At the same time, the U.S. government has also added restrictions on travel to the Soviet Union and Eastern European socialist countries for foreign residents in the U.S. According to the State Department's new regulations, foreign residents traveling to these countries need to obtain prior approval to return to the United States before leaving the United States.

    推行敌视社会主义国家政策又一步骤
    美禁止旅美外侨到中朝越阿四国旅行
    新华社2日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院1日宣布禁止旅居美国的外国侨民到中国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国和阿尔巴尼亚旅行或者在旅行中路过这些国家，这是美国政府坚持推行敌视社会主义国家政策的又一步骤。
    美国政府过去已颁布命令，禁止美国公民到上述国家旅行。国务院的新规定实际上是扩大这道命令的适用范围，使之包括旅居美国的外国侨民。美国政府同时对在美的外国侨民到苏联和东欧社会主义国家旅行也增添限制。根据国务院的新规定，外国侨民到这些国家旅行时在离开美国前就需要事先取得返回美国的批准。
