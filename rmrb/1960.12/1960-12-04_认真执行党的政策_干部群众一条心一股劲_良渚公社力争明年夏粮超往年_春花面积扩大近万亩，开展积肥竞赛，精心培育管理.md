(People's Daily report) Seriously Implement the Party's Policies, Cadres and the Masses United as One

Liangzhu Commune Strives for a Summer Grain Harvest Exceeding Previous Years

Spring Flower Area Expanded by Nearly Ten Thousand Mu, Launching a Manure Accumulation Competition, Meticulously Cultivating and Managing

This newspaper reports that the Liangzhu Commune in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, has comprehensively implemented the Party's policies, and a great situation has emerged in production: the enthusiasm of the masses is soaring, the work style of the cadres is thorough, the relationship between cadres and the masses is unprecedentedly close, and both production and life are well managed. The planting area of ​​spring flowers (wheat, rapeseed, broad beans, etc.) in the entire commune has increased by 9,503 mu compared to last year, and the sown area accounts for more than 90% of the total cultivated land area. The spring grain planted by each production team has exceeded the planned area. Sideline income has increased by more than 70,000 yuan in just over ten days. Boats and farm tools have been universally repaired. Rural market trade is active.

However, the commune members are not satisfied with the existing achievements. As soon as the autumn harvest and winter planting ended, and the "three guarantees and one implementation" for spring flowers were in place, they began to discuss the issue of exceeding contracted production, determined to strive for a summer harvest next year that would be better than any previous year.

High Production Enthusiasm

Now, while continuing to expand intercropping and relay planting, the commune members are vigorously engaged in spring flower cultivation. After hearing on the radio that cold air from the north was moving south, the members of the Red Star Production Team arranged for labor to accumulate and apply fertilizer that very night. In three days, more than half of the production team's 300 mu of rapeseed, wheat, and broad beans had been fertilized once to keep them warm. On the night of November 23, it rained heavily, and mountain water from Mount Daxiong Temple poured directly into the Youcheban and Dufuqiaotouban fields of the Jianhe Production Team, flooding 50 mu of spring flower fields. The next morning, the commune members went to dig ditches and drain water, and in one morning, they basically removed the accumulated water, ensuring full seedling emergence.

"If you want a high yield of spring flowers, accumulating and applying fertilizer is the most important." In the Yanqiao Production Team, a manure accumulation competition was launched between teams and between commune members. Recently, more than one hundred boats from the entire commune have been transporting manure to Hangzhou every day, transporting approximately 6,000 dan of manure daily.

While vigorously grasping the cultivation and management of spring flowers, this commune is also carrying out winter sideline production. After the Red Flag Production Team announced the trial calculation plan for the autumn harvest distribution, the commune members were determined to achieve a final settlement and distribution that exceeded the trial calculation. Each team organized a portion of the labor force to go to the mountains to quarry stones and cut firewood, generating more than 15,000 yuan in income, an average increase of more than 20 yuan per household. By November 24, the total sideline income of the commune was more than 70,000 yuan.

Good Cadre-Masses Relationship

After conscientiously implementing the Party's policies, cadres at all levels of the commune received profound education and further realized that as long as they acted in accordance with the Party's policies and relied on the masses, all difficulties could be overcome. Therefore, their work enthusiasm is growing. More than seventy cadres from the entire commune have gone deep into the production teams, working with the commune members during the day and discussing and resolving production problems with the masses at night. Due to the significant improvement in the ideological work style of the cadres and the close relationship between cadres and the masses, the masses actively helped the cadres to come up with ideas and solutions. Based on the suggestion of commune member Chen Jinrong, the Lianhe Production Team merged the team's canteen, sewing and laundry group, and the kindergarten's canteen and laundry group, saving twenty-three full laborers, who were put into spring flower field management.

Well-Arranged Life

This commune also attaches great importance to arranging the lives of the masses and the combination of work and rest. Cadres at all levels of the commune have gone deep into the canteens to help the canteens formulate democratic management systems, establish family production, and help commune members arrange planned grain consumption and conserve grain use. More than 130 canteens in the entire commune have planted more than 4,000 mu of vegetables and raised many pigs, chickens, and ducks. The family production of the canteens is becoming more and more substantial. In order to achieve a combination of work and rest, each production team has implemented a vacation system.

Because the policies are deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, more than 11,000 cadres and commune members in the entire commune are of one mind and one heart, fighting in the fields, accumulating fertilizer in large quantities, carefully managing and meticulously cultivating spring flowers, and are full of confidence in striving for a summer harvest next year that exceeds any previous year.

### 认真执行党的政策　干部群众一条心一股劲  良渚公社力争明年夏粮超往年  春花面积扩大近万亩，开展积肥竞赛，精心培育管理

    认真执行党的政策　干部群众一条心一股劲
    良渚公社力争明年夏粮超往年
    春花面积扩大近万亩，开展积肥竞赛，精心培育管理
    本报讯　浙江杭州市良渚公社全面贯彻执行党的政策，生产出现一派大好形势：群众干劲冲天，干部作风深入，干群关系空前密切，生产生活都搞得好。全社春花（大小麦、油菜、蚕豆等）种植面积比去年增加九千五百零三亩，播种面积占耕地总面积90％以上。各生产小队所种的春粮都超过计划面积。副业收入在短短的十多天中，增加了七万多元。船只、农具普遍进行了修理。农村集市贸易活跃。
    可是，社员们并不满足已有成绩，秋收冬种刚刚结束，春花三包一落实，他们就纷纷议论超包产的问题，决心争取明年夏收比以往任何一年都好。
    生产劲头高
    现在社员们在继续扩种套种的同时，正在大搞春花培育。红星生产队社员们从广播中知道了北方冷空气南下以后，当天夜里各小队就安排好了积肥施肥劳力。三天时间，全生产队三百多亩油菜、大小麦和蚕豆，已有一半以上施上了一次保暖肥。11月23日夜，倾盆大雨，大雄寺山的山水直泻建合生产队的油车坂和独甫桥头坂，五十亩春花田被淹没了。第二天一早社员们就去开沟排水，一个上午，就基本上排除了积水，确保了全苗。
    “若要春花产量高，积肥施肥最重要。”在严家桥生产队，小队与小队、社员与社员你追我赶地展开了积肥竞赛。近日来，全公社每天有一百多只船到杭州运粪，日运粪约六千多担。
    在大抓春花培育管理的同时，这个公社还开展了冬季副业生产。红旗生产队秋收分配试算方案公布以后，社员们决心做到决算分配超试算。各小队组织一部分劳力上山开石子、砍毛柴，已收入一万五千多元，平均每户增加收入二十多元。到11月24日止，全公社副业收入七万多元。
    干群关系好
    认真贯彻执行党的政策以后，公社各级干部受到了深刻的教育，进一步认识到只要按照党的政策办事，依靠群众，什么困难都可以克服，因而工作劲头越来越大。全公社七十多个干部都深入到生产小队，白天和社员一起劳动，晚上和群众商量解决生产中的问题。由于干部的思想作风显著改进，干群关系密切，群众积极帮助干部出主意、想办法。联合生产队根据社员陈金荣的建议，把小队的食堂、缝纫洗衣组和幼儿班的食堂、洗衣组合并起来，节约了二十三个整劳力，投入春花田间管理。
    生活安排好
    这个公社对安排群众生活和劳逸结合问题也很重视。公社各级干部都深入食堂，帮助食堂制订民主管理制度，建立家底生产，帮助社员安排计划用粮、节约用粮。全社一百三十多个食堂已种蔬菜四千多亩，还养了不少猪和鸡鸭，食堂的家底生产越来越厚。为了作到劳逸结合，各生产队都实行了休假制度。
    由于政策深入人心，全社一万一千多名干部社员一条心，一股劲，奋战田间，大积肥料，精管细管春花，满怀信心争取明年夏收超过以往任何一年。（附图片）
