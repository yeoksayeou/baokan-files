The Yue Opera Troupe from Xuchang Prefecture, Henan Province, recently performed in Beijing for the first time, allowing the capital's audience to appreciate another Henan opera genre besides the well-known Yu Opera – Yue Opera.

Yue Opera has a very deep mass base in Henan. Its music – the tunes and singing patterns – preserves many elements of Kunqu Opera, but it also has its own style. The main instrument is the "siguxian" (four-stringed lute), so it is also called "Siguxian" in eastern Henan. There are different opinions about its origin. Some say that Yue Opera is derived from the tunes sung during the restoration of the state by King Goujian of Yue in the late Spring and Autumn Period; others say that Yuan Dynasty zaju (variety plays) spread to the Nanyang area in the late Yuan Dynasty and were then refined by artists during the Ming Dynasty, eventually becoming Yue Opera. Although the opinions differ, the Zhuangwang Temple Stele in Sheqi Town, Nanyang, proves that Yue Opera has existed for at least three hundred years.

Yue Opera's repertoire has always been divided into two types: "zhengzhuangxi" (formal plays) and "waizhuangxi" (informal plays). Zhengzhuangxi are mostly robe and belt plays featuring male and painted-face roles, with the titles of "Great Eighteen Books" and "Small Eighteen Books." The Great Eighteen Books include titles such as "Seizing the Fire Bucket," "King Wen Eats His Son," and "Qin Qiong Sells His Horse." The Small Eighteen Books include titles such as "A Handful of Snow," "Two Wolves Mountain," "Wujiang River Bank," and "Ten Palaces" (depicting the story of Yang Guang's struggle for the throne). The structure of the scripts is relatively strict, and each singing section has a specific tune and key. The performance is also richer, especially the painted-face roles, which have a strong local flavor and a majestic momentum. We can still find this characteristic in the Yue Opera "Wu Ning Mansion" we recently saw.

Waizhuangxi, also known as "huoci liantaiben" (living-word serial plays), mainly feature young male, young female, and clown roles. The lyrics are colloquial and full of life. This can also be seen in "The Wind-Attracting Tree" and "Dropping the Seal" performed this time.

Before liberation, Yue Opera was devastated by reactionary rule, which slowed its development compared to Yu Opera. Since the founding of the People's Republic, under the care and support of the Party, it has regained its life and undergone new changes. For example, the huoci liantaixi now has standard scripts, and modern-themed dramas have begun to be written and performed. Many excellent actors have emerged, such as veteran actors Zhang Xiuqing and Shen Fengmei, and female roles such as Zhang Guilan and Mao Ailian, who came to Beijing this time. They all have high artistic achievements and unique artistic styles in portraying characters, singing, and performing.

Many traditional Yue Opera plays seem to have this characteristic: they have their own way of handling the same themes. Comparing Yue Opera's "Receiving Jiang Wei" with Beijing Opera's "Tianshui Pass," or Yue Opera's "The Big辕门" with Beijing Opera and Bangzi Opera's "斩子辕门" ("斩子辕门" - "Yuanmen Executes His Son"), we will find that the structure, interludes, and even some character portrayals are significantly different. Yue Opera often presents them more vividly, and the characters' personalities are written more boldly with delicacy. For example, in the Yue Opera "Receiving Jiang Wei," Zhuge Liang's appearance shows both his determination to attack Wei and his sigh for the lack of competent assistants; - when Ma Dai reports that Jiang Wei has seen through the plan and even defeated Zhao Yun, he is both surprised and delighted. This thought and feeling directly echoes the persuasion to surrender in the later scene. At the same time, the description of Wei Yan's ridicule of Zhao Yun further sets off Zhuge Liang's demeanor as the commander who rebukes Wei Yan and comforts Zhao Yun. Below, the arrow engraved with Jiang Wei's name, which Ma Dai picked up, is cleverly used to shoot Ma Zun's troops, making the counter-espionage plan more effective. Another example is "The Big辕门", in the scene where the Eighth Prince persuades Yang Yanzhao to pardon Yang Zongbao, the beginning mainly shows his consistent friendly relationship with the Yang family, but when Yang Yanzhao emphasizes the impartiality of military law and the merits that the Yang family has earned themselves, the conversation turns into an argument. When Yang Yanzhao angrily hands over his seal, the Eighth Prince does not appear helpless as in other operas, but angrily points out: "You are deliberately shirking the important task of breaking the Tianmen Formation, and I will ask the Emperor for a pardon," and leaves in anger. This makes the personalities of the two people clearer. For example, after Zongbao is pardoned, Jiao Zan suddenly feels that he has "accidentally" created favorable conditions for breaking the Tianmen Formation in this incident, so he claims credit to Yang Yanzhao. Yang Yanzhao suddenly asks him "Do you know your crime?" He then points out, "You were the one who first tricked Meng Liang into stealing the Dragon-Taming Wood, you were the one who instigated Zongbao to go out, and you were the one who moved the Old Duchess and the Eighth Prince! Now that Zongbao has been pardoned, it is time to punish the culprit!" Jiao Zan panics, Meng Liang asks for forgiveness on his behalf, and Yang Yanzhao pardons Jiao Zan. ... Such interludes are rarely seen in other opera genres. The "Wu Ning Mansion" performed this time also has this characteristic: the plot is quite similar to "Yang Liulang Secretly Visits the Three Passes," but the handling is different. Although it also uses the Song-Liao struggle as the background and depicts the conflict between loyal and treacherous officials in the Song Dynasty, this conflict is not only limited to the opposition of loyal and treacherous individuals, but further exposes the昏庸 (hūn yōng) and suspicious nature of the Song Dynasty ruler, Emperor Taizong. It also writes about some small contradictions between the佘太君 (Shé Tài Jūn) and the柴郡主 (Chái Jùnzhǔ) within the Yang family regarding different views on the event. Finally, with the premise of putting the country first, they achieved a unified action, demonstrating the consistent patriotic thinking of the Yang family.

Yue Opera with young female roles as the main focus can be represented by "The Wind-Attracting Tree" and "Dropping the Seal" performed this time. From the revised version of "The Wind-Attracting Tree", we see an old fortune-teller who meets two sisters-in-law in the countryside. Because they want to sue a local tyrant, many people are afraid to write the complaint. From their questions and answers under the tree where they are sheltering from the rain, the old man hears about this unfair incident and resolutely writes the complaint for them, and directs them to go to Bao Gong to file a complaint; it turns out that this old man is Prime Minister Wang Yanling in disguise. The original version of this play was about Emperor Qianlong's private visit, and Bao Zheng was originally Liu Yong, but now it is more reasonable to change it like this. The story is so simple, but the play successfully portrays a lovely image of a thirteen or fourteen-year-old girl - Wang Yujie. Her demeanor and language leave a deep impression on the audience; she is neither Chunxiang in "闹学" ("Nao Xue" - "Making a Fuss in School") nor Chunlan in "花田错" ("Hua Tian Cuo" - "Flower Field Wrong"), but has a more innocent and resilient, naive and witty characteristic. For example, the detail in the play where she uses a handkerchief to cover her sister-in-law's face to prevent Wang Yanling from seeing it summarizes many events in the play and concentratedly shows that this little girl has become quite vigilant because her family has been repeatedly persecuted by landlords. It makes people both sympathize with her experience and ignite hatred for the crimes of the landlords.

"掉印" ("Diao Yin" - "Dropping the Seal"), also known as "王子龙招亲" ("Wang Zilon Recruits a Bride"), is a play with a strong legendary flavor. It depicts Wang Zilong, a newly appointed top scholar, who is sent to Henan as an imperial inspector to secretly investigate the misdeeds of Ding Shigui, the adopted son of Yan Song. He tries to stop Ding from forcibly marrying Cui Ping, the daughter of Han Zhongxiao, the magistrate of Xuzhou, by using fortune-telling, but is beaten and driven out, losing his official seal. It is picked up by a maid from the Han family and given to Cui Ping. Wang Zilong seeks the seal and happens to meet Magistrate Han, falsely claiming to accuse Ding Shigui. Han then takes Wang back to the inner yamen and recognizes him as his adopted son. After that, Han Cuiping wants to find the imperial inspector through the seal, while Wang Zilong wants to find the seal through the maid, and both of them have the common goal of punishing the evil tyrant, thus weaving a comedic plot. Although Han Cuiping in this play is the daughter of an official family, she also has a relatively cheerful and witty personality, with the characteristics of a simple Henan girl, so the play is more full of life. Perhaps, precisely because this Yue Opera genre entered the city later, it can retain more of the local flavor; this flavor is simple, healthy, and can give the characters a fresher life force.

    漫谈河南越调的特色
    陶君起
    河南省许昌专区越调剧团最近第一次来京演出，使首都的观
  众在夙所熟悉的豫剧以外，又欣赏到另一个河南的剧种——越调。
    越调在河南有很深厚的群众基础，它的音乐——曲牌和唱的板式保存了很多昆腔的成分，但又具有它自己的风格。乐器以四股弦为主，所以在豫东又叫做
  “四股弦”。它的起源，其说不一，有人说：越调就是春秋末越王勾践复国时所歌的调子流传下来的；有人则说：元代末年杂剧流传到南阳一带，又经过明代艺人们加工，才成为越调。说法虽然纷歧，但根据南阳赊镇的庄王庙碑，可以证明越调至少已有三百年以上的历史了。
    越调的剧目一向分为正装戏和外装戏两种：正装戏大多是生、净为主的袍带戏，有大十八本和小十八本之称，大十八本如《抢火斗》、《文王吃子》、《秦琼卖马》等，小十八本如《一捧雪》、《两狼山》、《乌江岸》、《十王宫》（演杨广争位故事）等。剧本组织上比较严格，每段唱都有一定的曲牌和调门。表演上也较丰富，尤其是净角，更具有浓郁的地方色彩和磅礴雄浑的气势，我们在最近看的越调《无佞府》中，还可以寻绎到这一特点。
    外装戏一名活词连台本，以小生、小旦、小丑为主，词句通俗，生活气息也较浓。从这次演出的《招风树》、《掉印》中，也可以看出来。
    越调在解放前曾受到反动统治的摧残，使它的发展比豫剧迟缓了一些。建国以来，在党的关怀和扶植之下，才重新获得了生命，也起了新的变化。比如活词连台戏已有了准词，也开始编演了现代题材剧目，更涌现了许多优秀的演员，如老生张秀卿、申凤梅等，旦角张桂兰和这次来京的毛爱莲等。她们无论在刻划人物上，唱腔或表演上都具有较高的艺术成就和独特的艺术风格。
    越调的许多传统剧目似乎又有这么一个特点：就是对同一题材，却有它自己的处理方法。试拿越调《收姜维》和京剧《天水关》相比较，或拿越调《大辕门》和京剧、梆子的《辕门斩子》相比较，就会发现结构、穿插甚至人物的某些描绘都有较明显的不同。越调中往往表现得更生动些，人物性格也写得粗犷中有细致。比如《收姜维》剧中，诸葛亮一出场既表现了伐魏的决心，却也有辅佐乏人之叹；——听马岱报告姜维识破计策，反而挫败了赵云，不觉又惊又喜。这一思想感情，直与后场劝降相呼应。同时还描写了魏延对赵云的讥嘲，更衬出诸葛斥魏延、慰赵云的主将风度来。下面更巧妙地利用了马岱所拾来镌有姜维名字的箭支来射马遵的部兵，使反间之计更有力地进行。又如《大辕门》写八贤王劝杨延昭赦免杨宗保的一段戏，开始主要是表现他和杨家一贯的友好关系，而当杨延昭强调军法无私和杨家自己挣来的功劳时，才转入口角。及至杨延昭一怒交印，八贤王却不像一般剧中那样地手足无措，而是气愤地指出：“你这是有意推卸破天门的重任，我自会向叔王讨赦书”，便含怒而去；这样就使两个人的性格更鲜明些。再如最后赦宗保后，焦赞忽觉得自己在这场事件中“歪打正着”地造成了破天门阵的有利条件，于是向杨延昭表功。杨延昭却突然问他“你可知罪？”接着指出“最先诳孟良盗降龙木的是你，挑唆宗保出马的也是你，而搬动太君、八贤王的又是你！如今赦了宗保，正要惩治祸首！”焦赞慌了，孟良代他求恕，杨延昭才赦免了焦赞，……诸如这些穿插，都是其它剧种里所少见的。这次演出的《无佞府》也同样具有这一特点：本来剧情颇近于《杨六郎私下三关》，但处理上却又不一样。它虽也以宋辽斗争为背景，描写了宋朝忠奸的矛盾，可是这一矛盾却不仅仅停留在忠奸个人的对立，而更进一步揭露了封建统治阶级宋太宗的昏庸和猜忌。写杨家内部佘太君和柴郡主之间，也还存在着对事件不同看法的一些小矛盾。最后才在以国家为重的前提下，取得了一致的行动，表现了杨家将的一贯爱国思想。
    越调以小旦为主的剧目，可以此次演出的《招风树》和《掉印》为代表。从《招风树》的整理本里，我们看见一个卖卦的老叟在乡下遇见两姑嫂，由于她们要控告的是个土豪，许多人都不敢写状。老叟从她们在树下避雨的问答中，听到了这桩不平的事，毅然代她们写了状，而且指点她们到包公那儿去上告；原来这个老叟是首相王延龄乔装的。这个戏的原本是写乾隆私访，包拯这个人原是刘镛，现在这样改动一下，倒更合理些。故事就是这样简单，可是戏里却成功地刻划出一个十三、四岁的小姑娘——王玉姐的可爱形象。她的举止和语言，给观众留下较深的印象；她既不是《闹学》里的春香，也不是《花田错》里的春兰，而另具有更天真而韧性、幼稚而机敏的特色。比如戏中只通过她用手帕遮挡嫂嫂的脸，不让王延龄看见的细节动作和神情，就概括了剧中许多情事，集中地表现出这个小妮，由于她一家屡遭地主的迫害，已使得她具有了相当的警惕性。使人既同情她的遭遇，同时，也燃起对地主罪恶的憎恨来。
    《掉印》一名《王子龙招亲》，是一出传奇性较浓的戏。它描写新科状元王子龙简放巡按，到河南私访严嵩义子丁世贵的劣迹，因借算卦阻止丁要强娶许州知县韩忠孝之女翠屏的企图，被殴逐出，失落印信，恰被韩家丫环拾去交给翠屏。王子龙寻印，巧遇韩县令，假称控告丁世贵，韩便将王携回内衙，认作义子。此后，韩翠屏想通过印来找到巡按，王子龙却又想通过丫环来找到印信，而两人又都有惩除恶霸的共同目的，于是交织成一场喜剧性的情节。这出戏里的韩翠屏虽是宦门之女，却也具有比较爽朗而机智的性格，带有朴质的河南少女的特色，因而全剧的生活气息就更浓郁些。也许，正是由于越调这个剧种进入城市较晚，才能保有更多的乡土气息；这气息是淳朴的、健康的，能给予人物以较新鲜的生命力量。
