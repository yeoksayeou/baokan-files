    In the main imperialist country of modern times—the United States—the decay of capitalism is manifested most clearly. American monopoly capital reveals its obvious inability to utilize the existing productive forces. The United States, the richest of the developed capitalist countries, has become a country with particularly serious chronic unemployment. Increasing under-capacity operation in industry has become a regular phenomenon there. In the post-war years, despite greatly increased military appropriations made possible by lowering the living standards of the working people, the growth rate of production is declining, barely exceeding population growth. Crises of overproduction are becoming more frequent. This most industrially developed capitalist country has become the most deformed military-ized economy.

    在现代帝国主义的主要国家——美国，资本主义的腐朽表现得最明显。美国垄断资本暴露出它显然没有能力利用现有的生产力。发达的资本主义国家中最富有的国家——美国，成了经常失业现象特别严重的国家。工业开工日益不足，成了那里的经常现象。在战后年代里，尽管靠降低劳动人民的生活水平大大增加军事拨款，但是生产的增长速度正在下降，勉强超过人口的增长。生产过剩的危机更加频繁了。这个工业最发达的资本主义国家成了一个最畸形的军事化经济的国家。
