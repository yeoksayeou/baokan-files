Magpies Chattering
Ge Yuying, Liu Lu People's Commune, Xinghua, Jiangsu

After sending her son to his mother-in-law's house, Auntie Lu finally breathed a sigh of relief. She patted her hair, dusted off her clothes, and sat down on a stool near the door.

The new bride would be coming through the door tomorrow. Auntie Lu had met the new bride once, and she was indeed as the villagers said: one of the most beautiful and capable girls in the entire commune. Auntie Lu’s heart felt like it was soaking in honey. How could she not be happy when her dream of many years was about to come true? More than twenty years ago, her son was born in a dilapidated cowshed belonging to a landlord. The little one had no clothes and was wrapped in a piece of torn trousers. The mother didn't even have a drop of oil during her postpartum confinement. The landlord, greedy as he was, even wanted to scrape together some "early tea money" from their dilapidated cowshed. When they couldn't pay the "rent," he forced the family to move. She, along with her husband, embraced her son and wandered in the heavy snow.... At that time, she never dared to imagine the day her son would get married. If it weren’t for the Communist Party, their old and young bones would have been buried in some pile of yellow earth! At this moment, her eyes looked deeply at the portrait of Chairman Mao. She felt that Chairman Mao was smiling at her, sharing her happiness.

The setting sun shone directly into the doorway, warming Auntie Lu. How pleasant it was. She turned her eyes to look at the new house, admiring her carefully arranged decorations... Everything satisfied her, except for the wall near the cabinet, which seemed a little empty, making her uneasy. She blamed her disappointing old man again. Her son's wedding was a joyous event for everyone, especially since the family had come from bitter hardship! However, the old man didn’t seem to think so. Every morning, he would either sharpen his chisel and axe or put on his old glasses to read the newspaper. After breakfast, he would go to his brigade's farm tool repair shop. When he came back in the evening, he would only talk about the competition in the factory and the good news he had read in the newspaper. Once, she deliberately pouted and said in anger, "The son wasn't raised by me alone, am I the only one worrying about it?" The old man said humorously, "Hehe, why use two laborers for this little thing? It’s easy to handle, just buy some wedding candies and have a cup of wedding wine!" In fact, Auntie Lu understood the old man’s feelings very well. She knew that the factory had a heavy task of repairing farm tools, and she didn’t want to divert the old man’s energy. Her demands on the old man were not high. She had bought some glass from the city and wanted the old man to spare some time to make some wooden frames to put all the award certificates they had received since the Great Leap Forward in them, hang them in the new house, and give the new bride a good impression—her husband was a model worker in the commune, and her in-laws were also advanced figures! She said to the old man, "As the saying goes, when a new bride enters her husband's house, she values people more than fields..." The old man interrupted her and said, "Hey, you old fool, white pigeons always fly to bright places. The girl already knows our family's background!" Auntie Lu said, "Okay, then let's hang up the award certificates for her to see!" The old man shook his head and said, "Don't make the girl laugh. She has won more award certificates than our family of three combined. Haven't you heard? She's like Mu Guiying in production!" Auntie Lu had heard people say that the girl was indeed good at production and had won many awards. Because of this, she felt the need for wooden glass frames even more and kept pestering the old man. The old man said, "This is delicate work, it takes a lot of time..." Auntie Lu said anxiously, "You always have to give the new bride a good impression at the beginning!" "Hey! Don't you see I'm busy all day long!" The old man said inexplicably and left.

The more Auntie Lu thought about it, the more uncomfortable she felt. She stood up, closed the door, and went out. Now her heart was completely drawn to the scene of accumulating fertilizer in front of her: the large river in front of the village was filled with mud-dredging boats. The sounds of people talking and laughing, the rushing of the river water, and the collision of the boat tails mixed together. The turbulent water surface seemed to understand human feelings, happily jumping with dazzling silver waves. Seeing this scene, Auntie Lu was both happy and uneasy. She seemed to hear the second team leader and the third team leader talking about their team with irony: "In ten days it will be 1961. The first team will always send out one less boat than us. It seems that the first team's plan to spread slurry mud on the wheat fields before the New Year will fail!..."

During this time, Auntie Lu almost forgot about her son's wedding. She felt she had so much to say to people and walked quickly on the village lanes. People who met her would say, "Oh my, a person who's about to be a grandmother is so busy. The new house must be decorated like a flower palace!" When they said this, Auntie Lu thought of the glass frames again and couldn't help but blame the old man again. So she walked all the way to the farm tool factory. Outside the window, she heard people in the workshop joking with the old man:

"Master craftsman, you have to ask the heavens for leave to prepare a greeting gift for the new bride!" "Otherwise, she won't call you father-in-law!" "..."

"Well, of course, I'm busy with it!"

Auntie Lu was happy and put her eyes close to the glass window to look inside, but her heart cooled again. It turned out that the old man was repairing a broken boat! She was familiar with that broken boat. Two years ago, several clumsy young men thought it couldn't withstand battle and had been leaving it idle at the head of the ditch. Recently, the team had raised it, and the old man had taken the initiative to accept the task of repairing the broken boat.

At this moment, Auntie Lu really wanted to break into the room and drag the old man back to make glass frames, but everyone was working so enthusiastically, how could she be embarrassed? ...

Now it was the third morning since the new bride had entered the door. The son, having finished his leave, went to work in the fields early in the morning. The old man went to his farm tool factory as usual, and the new bride also wanted to go to the fields, but was persuaded by the villagers to rest for another day. Auntie Lu was also forced by the people to accompany the new bride for another talk and introduce the situation of their team.

Auntie Lu had become like a curious child, circling around the new bride. No wonder, this girl was really lovable. First, she was beautiful, and second, she had a good temperament. She called her mother-in-law "Mom" with every word, as intimate as a real mother.

The new bride brought a bundle of books and songbooks and began to sort them out. Auntie Lu's eyeballs followed the bride's nimble hands. Suddenly, several colorful award certificates jumped into Auntie Lu's eyes. She suddenly remembered the glass frames. She thought that if the old man saw the new bride's award certificates, he would be so happy that every strand of his beard would be smiling, and he would surely drive all night to make glass frames. So she happily exclaimed:

"Good girl, such beautiful award certificates, can we hang them?"

"Mom, these are old ones already." The new bride smiled and said, "Let's welcome 1961 and strive for advancement in production. Let's hang up new ones later!"

"Hang up new ones?"

"Yes!"

"Hmm..." Auntie Lu had something on her mind and said solemnly, "Our team has one less boat than others. Just talking about spreading slurry mud, I'm afraid we will fall behind them!"

"One less boat?" The new bride raised her light eyebrows and then anxiously rubbed her hands, jokingly said, "If there's a boat, I can show my skills, Mom! Your son is not necessarily my match!"

"Ah!" Auntie Lu's eyes fell on the new bride's rosy face, radiating youthful radiance, and she also rubbed her hands like the bride, "My palms are also itching... Alas! Boat! Boat..."

While the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law were talking, the old man appeared at the door with a proud smile on his face, like a victorious general returning to court.

"Old man, is the broken boat repaired?" Auntie Lu became active.

"Hey! Even the dredges are ready!"

"Mom! Let's go!" The bride said as she ran out, laughing mischievously...

The laughter of the old and the young made the magpies in the big tree in the yard also feel their throats itch, and they started chattering...

    喜鹊喳喳
    江苏兴化刘陆公社  葛玉莹
    把儿子打发到丈母家去以后，陆大妈才算松了口气，撂撂头发，掸掸衣裳，在靠门旁的一张凳子上坐下来。
    新媳妇明天就要娶过门了，陆大妈见过新媳妇一面，那可真像乡亲们所称道的，是全公社数一数二的俊俏能干的姑娘。陆大妈的心，就像浸在蜜罐里。不是嘛，多年的梦想就在眼前实现了，怎么叫她不高兴呢？二十多年前，儿子是在地主家破牛车棚里出世的，小家伙没有衣服，用一条破裤子裹着，做妈的坐月子也没有油沾牙，贪财如命的地主还想在破牛车棚上刮点早茶钱，缴不起“租金”就逼着他们一家搬家。她，跟着丈夫，搂着儿子，在茫茫大雪里飘荡……。那时候，怎么也不敢想儿子娶媳妇的这一天，要不是来了共产党，老骨头嫩骨头不知丢到哪堆黄土里了！此刻，她的眼睛深情地瞅着毛主席像，她觉得毛主席正笑眯眯地瞅着她，与她分享快乐。
    西斜的太阳光直射进门堂，照在陆大妈身上暖洋洋的，该多惬意啊。她扭眼望望新房，欣赏起自己精心的布置……一切都使她满意，就是橱柜那边墙壁显得有点空荡，叫她不称心，她心里又埋怨起她的不争气的老头儿来了。儿子娶媳妇，无论对谁来说都是件乐事，况且一家人是打苦水里熬出来的呀！然而，老头儿好像没有那么回事，每天早晨起来，不是磨他的凿子、斧头，就是撑起老光眼镜看报纸，吃过早饭就进他的大队农具修配厂；晚上回来，只听他介绍厂里竞赛的情形，讲从报上看来的好消息。有一回，她故意噘着嘴赌气道：“儿子不是我一个人养的，难道光我个人操心？”老头儿风趣地说：“嘿嘿，这点小事还要投放两个劳动力？事情很好办嘛，买点喜糖，喝杯喜酒就行了！”其实，陆大妈很理解老头儿的心情，她知道厂里整修农具的任务很大，她才不愿分散老头儿的精力呢！她对老头儿的要求并不高，只是她从城里买回几块玻璃，想让老头儿抽空打几副木头框框，好把一家人大跃进以来得的奖状都嵌进去，挂到新房里，一方面美化新房，一方面给新媳妇有个好印象——丈夫是公社的标兵，公婆也是先进人物呀！她对老头儿说：“俗话说，新媳妇进了婆家门，轻看田地重看人……”老头儿截断她的话说：“唉，你这老糊涂，白鸽子专拣亮地方飞嘛，咱家的底细，早给姑娘摸着啦！”陆大妈说：“好嘛，那就把奖状挂出来给她看吧！”老头儿摇摇头说：“别惹姑娘见笑了，她得的奖状可比咱们一家三口加起来的多哩，没听说过吗？赛穆桂英呢！”陆大妈听是听人说过，这姑娘生产上确实不坏，得过不少奖状，正因为这，她更觉得木头玻璃框框的必要了，一直跟老头儿纠缠。老头儿说：“这东西是细活，很费时间，……”陆大妈急着说：“开头总要给新媳妇有个好印象啊！”“嘿！你看我不是一天到晚在忙着嘛！”老头儿没头没脑地说着便走了。
    陆大妈越想心里越不是滋味，站起身子带上门走了出去。现在她的心，完全被眼前积肥的场景所吸引了：村前大河港里，布满了取泥的船只，人们的谈笑声，河水哗哗声，罱泥船梢尾的碰击声，混成一片，那动荡的水面也似乎通人情，快乐地跳跃着刺目的银波。看了这情景，陆大妈又高兴又不好受，她似乎听到二队长跟三队长在用讥讽的口吻谈他们一队：“再过十天就是1961年啦，一队总比我们少出动一条船，看来年前浇一遍三麦泥浆的计划，一队要瞎啦！……”
    这一阵，陆大妈差不多把娶媳妇的事全忘了，她觉得肚里有多少话要对人讲，在村巷上急急地走着。碰见她的人都这样说：“哎呀呀，快做奶奶的人，就是忙啊，新房布置得像个花宫了吧！”这一说，陆大妈又想到玻璃框子，不由得又埋怨起老头儿来了，于是她一直走到农具厂。在窗外，她听到作场里的人们在对老头儿开玩笑说：
    “大师傅，你得请上天把假，为新媳妇准备点见面礼！”“要不然，人家才不喊你公爹哩！”“……”
    “嗯，理所当然啦，我不正在忙着吗！”
    陆大妈心里一喜，把眼睛贴近玻璃窗朝里一望，心又冷了，原来老头儿在修一条破船！那条破船她是熟悉的，大前年几个大手大脚的青年后生嫌它经不起上阵，一直把它搁在沟头里闲着，最近队里把它起上来，老头儿主动接受了包修这条破船的任务。
    陆大妈此刻真想闯进屋里把老头儿拖回去打玻璃框，可是大家都干得热呼呼的，怎么好意思呢？……
    现在是新媳妇过门的第三天上午了，儿子满了假一早下田干活去了。老头儿照常进他的农具厂，新媳妇也要下田，硬由乡亲们劝阻下来多休息一天，陆大妈也被人们强拉着陪新媳妇再谈谈，顺便介绍一下本队情况。
    陆大妈简直变成个好奇的孩子似的绕着新媳妇转。不怪呀，这姑娘实在惹人爱，一来模样儿长得俊俏，二来脾性好，对婆婆开口闭口娘呀娘的，同亲妈一般亲热。
    新媳妇带来一捆书呀唱本的，开始整理起来。陆大妈的眼珠跟着媳妇灵活的双手转。突然，几张五彩的奖状跳进陆大妈的眼帘，她猛然想起玻璃框框，她想到老头儿若是见了新媳妇的奖状，一定会喜得根根胡子都在笑，准会开个夜车打玻璃框框，于是她高兴地叫起来：
    “乖乖，多好看的奖状，可挂呀？”
    “娘，这已经是老的了。”新媳妇笑笑说：“咱们迎接1961年，生产上争先进，过些时挂新的吧！”
    “挂新的？”
    “是啊！”
    “嗯……”陆大妈有了心事，一本正经地说，“我们一队比人家少一条船，单说浇泥浆这一着，怕就要掉到人家后头了！”
    “少一条船？”新媳妇扬了扬淡淡的眉毛，随即着急地搓搓手，逗乐地说：“要是有条船，我可以显本领啦，娘！你儿子并不一定是我的对手！”
    “啊！”陆大妈的眼光落在新媳妇红晕的放射着青春光采的脸膛上，也学着媳妇的样子搓起手来，“我的手心儿也痒啦……唉！船！船……”
    婆媳俩正谈着，老头儿出现在门口，脸上现出得意的笑，好似一个得胜回朝的将军。
    “老头儿，破船修好啦？”陆大妈变得活跃起来。
    “嘿！连罱子都准备好啦！”
    “娘！我们走吧！”媳妇说着往外跑，一边??地笑起来……
    老人和青年的欢笑声，把院子里大树上喜鹊的嗓子也引得发起痒来，它们喳喳地叫开了……。（附图片）
