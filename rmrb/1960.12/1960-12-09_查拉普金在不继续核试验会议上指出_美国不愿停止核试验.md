Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, December 7th: According to TASS, the Soviet representative Zorin, attending the Geneva conference on the discontinuance of nuclear weapon tests by the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, stated at the conference on the 5th that the conference on the discontinuance of nuclear weapon tests has been held for more than two years. If both sides, and not just the Soviet Union, had sincerity, there would have been ample time to reach an agreement on the issue of stopping nuclear tests.

Zorin said that the progress of the conference clearly shows that the U.S. government is not committed to formulating a mutually acceptable treaty prohibiting nuclear tests, but continues to create new obstacles, trying to complicate the negotiations to obstruct the conference from reaching an agreement.

Zorin pointed out that the United States is trying to make the conference fit its line of "supervision without disarmament." He said that the United States wants to ensure favorable conditions for espionage through such supervision during the conference and wants to place the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in an unequal position within the supervisory bodies.

Zorin stated that the Soviet government will continue to make every effort to reach an agreement on the complete cessation of all nuclear weapon tests.

Zorin agreed to the request made by the U.S. representative Steel at the conference for the conference to adjourn and reconvene on February 7th of next year. Steel made this request because the United States had elected a new president, and the government would soon be replaced.

    查拉普金在不继续核试验会议上指出
    美国不愿停止核试验
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：出席苏、美、英三国不继续核试验日内瓦会议的苏联代表查拉普金5日在会议上发言指出，不继续核试验会议已经举行了两年多，如果是双方而不只是苏联有诚意，本来有足够的时间来就停止核试验问题达成协议。
    查拉普金说，会议的进程清楚表明，美国政府不是致力于制订出彼此可以接受的禁止核试验的条约，而是继续制造新的障碍，尽力使谈判复杂化以阻挠会议达成协议。
    查拉普金指出，美国力图使会议适合它“没有裁军的监督”的路线。他说，美国在会议中想确保利用这种监督来进行间谍活动的有利条件，并且想使苏联和社会主义国家在监督机构中处于不平等地位。
    查拉普金表示，苏联政府将继续作一切努力，争取就完全不继续一切核试验达成协议。
    查拉普金同意美国代表斯特尔在会上提出的会议休会到明年2月7日再举行的要求。斯特尔提出这要求是由于美国选出了新总统，不久就要改换政府。
