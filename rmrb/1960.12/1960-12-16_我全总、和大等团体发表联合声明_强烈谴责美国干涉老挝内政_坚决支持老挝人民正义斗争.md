Xinhua News Agency, 15th December. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the China Peace Committee, the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, the All-China Women's Federation, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation today jointly issued a statement strongly condemning and protesting the U.S. imperialists' criminal acts of using force to support the Nosavan traitorous group, expanding the civil war in Laos, and interfering in Laos' internal affairs.

The full text of the "Statement on Opposing U.S. Imperialist Interference and Aggression in Laos" issued by these six people's organizations is as follows:

The Chinese people express great indignation at the U.S. imperialists and their servant, the reactionary Thai authorities, for grossly interfering in Laos' internal affairs, violating Laos' sovereignty and independence, supporting the Lao traitorous group—the Nosavan group—in carrying out a large-scale civil war, undermining the Geneva Accords, and threatening peace in Indochina and Asia. This interference and aggression, which bloodily suppresses the Lao people's struggle for peaceful neutrality and national independence, cannot but arouse strong condemnation and protests from the people of Asia and the world.

The Chinese people fully support the statement issued by our government on the situation in Laos, opposing U.S. imperialism's use of force to support the Nosavan traitorous group, expanding the civil war in Laos, and interfering in Laos' internal affairs. The Chinese people resolutely support the Lao people's just struggle against U.S. imperialist interference, to safeguard national independence, and to strive for peaceful neutrality. Although U.S. imperialism and some members of its Southeast Asian aggressive bloc are continuing to exert military and political pressure on the Lao government, further opposing the Lao people's policy of upholding peaceful neutrality, national harmony, and national unity, the Lao people will never tolerate the interference and aggression of U.S. imperialism and the reactionary Thai authorities. We are excited to see that the Lao people are enthusiastically responding to the call of the Lao Patriotic Front, uniting to defend the motherland, and heroically resisting the enemy. We believe that the heroic Lao people, with the support of the people of the world, will, as long as they strengthen unity and persevere in struggle, thoroughly defeat all the evil schemes of the U.S. aggressors and their running dogs, and win the victory of their patriotic and just struggle.

    新华社15日讯　中华全国总工会、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国亚非团结委员会、中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会、中华全国青年联合会和中华全国学生联合会今天联合发表声明，强烈谴责和抗议美帝国主义用武力扶持诺萨万叛国集团，扩大老挝内战，干涉老挝内政的罪恶行为。
    这六个人民团体发表的“关于反对美帝国主义干涉和侵略老挝的声明”的全文如下：
    中国人民对美帝国主义和它的仆从泰国反动当局粗暴地干涉老挝内政、侵犯老挝的主权和独立，支持老挝的叛国集团——诺萨万集团进行大规模的内战、破坏日内瓦协议、威胁印度支那和亚洲和平的严重罪行，表示极大的愤慨。这种血腥镇压老挝人民争取和平中立、民族独立斗争的干涉和侵略行为，不能不引起亚洲和全世界人民的强烈谴责和抗议。
    中国人民完全拥护我国政府就老挝局势发表的声明，反对美帝国主义用武力扶持诺萨万叛国集团，扩大老挝内战，干涉老挝内政。中国人民坚决支持老挝人民反对美帝国主义干涉、维护民族独立、争取和平中立的正义斗争。尽管美帝国主义及其指使的东南亚侵略集团一些成员还在继续对老挝政府施加军事政治压力，进一步反对老挝人民拥护和平中立、民族和睦和国家统一的政策，但老挝人民绝不会容忍美帝国主义和泰国反动当局的干涉和侵略。我们兴奋地看到，老挝人民正在热烈地响应老挝爱国战线党的号召，团结起来保卫祖国，英勇地抗击敌人。我们相信，英勇的老挝人民，在全世界人民的支持下，只要加强团结，坚持斗争，必将彻底击败美国侵略者及其走狗的一切罪恶阴谋，取得爱国正义斗争的胜利。
