    Ten Thousand Brocade Threads Embroider the Earth
    Fang Mu
    
    Singing rings out, spirits soar, girls are sent down to our place. Taking the Earth as a ball of thread, ten thousand brocade threads embroider the land. First embroider rice, second embroider cotton, golden mountains and silver seas of fine farmland. Third embroider wheat, fourth embroider hemp, wheat leaves and hemp stalks pierce the clouds. Thousands of stitches sewn densely, every stitch embroidering spring. Embroider a highway like a golden dragon, connecting cities and villages closely. Embroider a sun, round and round, may the People's Commune last for ten thousand years.

    万条锦线绣大地
    方牧歌声响，斗志扬，姑娘下放俺地方。拿来地球当线团，万条锦线绣大地。一绣稻，二绣棉，金山银海好庄田。三绣麦，四绣麻，麦叶麻秆插云间。千针万线密密缝，针针线线绣春天。绣一条公路走金龙，城市农村紧相连。绣一个太阳圆又圆，人民公社万万年。
