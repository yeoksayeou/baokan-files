Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 30th: A government communiqué from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was released here today.

The communiqué said that under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the government, thanks to the high patriotism and creative labor of our people, the national three-year plan and the 1960 national plan for developing and transforming the economy and developing culture have been successfully completed. The socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist private industry and commerce has achieved a decisive victory. There have been major developments in agricultural and industrial production, capital construction, and all aspects of financial and economic work. Major achievements have been made in cultural, educational, and health work. The material and spiritual life of the working people has been further improved.

The communiqué said that the government meeting discussed the draft of the 1961 national plan formulated by the Vietnam State Planning Commission. The government meeting emphasized that the 1961 national plan has a particularly important role: this plan must serve as the foundation and driving force for the socialist construction cause in the coming years and the five-year plan. Relying on the achievements and implementation experience of the three-year plan, and in accordance with the resolutions of the Third Party Congress and the tasks and directions of the five-year plan, the 1961 national plan must meet the growing demands for developing the economy, building the North, and improving people's lives. In this spirit, the government meeting approved the tasks of the 1961 national plan.

The communiqué pointed out that the responsible state organs, from the central to the grassroots levels, must be invigorated, strive to improve their capabilities in all aspects of politics, organization, and technology, and fully exploit their potential to overfulfill the 1961 national plan, so as to serve as the foundation and driving force for the development of the socialist revolution cause in the coming years.

The communiqué said that the government meeting calls on all workers, peasants, cadres, soldiers, and people of all walks of life to greatly enhance their patriotism and socialist enthusiasm, vigorously promote patriotic competition, and be determined to complete and overfulfill the 1961 national plan.

The government meeting was held at the end of December 1960.
