Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 8th: Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, and head of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation, delivered the following speech at Moscow's Vnukovo Airport today upon departure:

Dear Comrade Brezhnev, dear comrades and friends:

Our Chinese Party and Government Delegation is about to conclude its visit to our great ally, the Soviet Union. During our visit, our delegation received warm and familial welcome and hospitality, and witnessed the tremendous achievements of the Soviet Union in all fields. At this moment of leaving Moscow, please allow me to express, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese Government, and the Chinese people, our deep gratitude to the CPSU Central Committee, the Soviet Government, and the Soviet people once again, and wish you new and even more brilliant achievements in the cause of fully developing communist construction.

More than a month ago, our delegation came here with the Chinese people's fraternal friendship for the Soviet people. Now, we are leaving here with the Soviet people's fraternal friendship for the Chinese people. We are deeply convinced that through our visit and talks with the leading comrades of the CPSU Central Committee, the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people will be further consolidated and developed, and the unity between the two parties and two countries will be further strengthened.

During our stay in the Soviet Union, our delegation also completed an important task, that is, we worked together with the CPSU and other fraternal parties to ensure the success of the meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties of various countries. The results of this meeting will undoubtedly greatly promote a new upsurge in the struggle of people of all countries for world peace, national liberation, democratic freedom, and socialism, promote the victorious development of the international communist movement, and promote the greater consolidation and strengthening of the socialist camp.

Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship and unity between the Chinese and Soviet parties, countries, and peoples!

Long live world peace!

Goodbye, dear comrades!

    刘少奇主席在机场上的讲话
    新华社莫斯科8日电　中共中央副主席、中华人民共和国主席、中国党政代表团团长刘少奇，今天在离开莫斯科伏努科夫机场时的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的勃列日涅夫同志，亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    我们中国党政代表团很快就要结束对我们伟大的盟邦——苏联的访问了。我们的代表团在访问期间受到了热情洋溢的欢迎和亲如家人的接待，看到了苏联各方面的巨大成就。在这离开莫斯科的时刻，请允许我代表中共中央、中国政府、中国人民再一次向苏共中央、苏联政府和苏联人民表示深深的感谢，并预祝你们在全面展开共产主义建设的事业中取得新的、更加辉煌的成就。
    一个多月以前，我们的代表团带着中国人民对苏联人民的兄弟般的友谊来到这里，现在，我们又带着苏联人民对中国人民的兄弟般的友谊离开这里。我们深信，经过我们的这次访问和同苏共中央领导同志的会谈，中苏两国人民的友谊将获得进一步的巩固和发展，中苏两党两国的团结将获得进一步的加强。
    我们的代表团在逗留苏联期间，还完成了一项重要的任务，这就是我们同苏共和其他兄弟党代表共同努力，使各国共产党和工人党代表会议获得了成功。这次会议的结果毫无疑问将大大促进各国人民争取世界和平、民族解放、民主自由和社会主义的斗争的新高涨，促进国际共产主义运动的胜利发展，促进社会主义阵营的更加巩固和壮大。
    中苏两党、两国和两国人民的永恒的、牢不可破的友谊和团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
    再见，亲爱的同志们！
